a
dedicatory
introduction
if
this
were
a
ponderous
work
of
realism
such
as
the
author
has
attempted
to
write
and
will
doubtless
essay
again
it
would
be
perilous
to
dedicate
it
to
the
splendid
assembly
of
young
british
writers
lest
the
critics
search
for
influences
and
imitations
but
since
this
is
a
flagrant
excursion
a
tale
for
people
who
still
read
dickens
and
clip
out
spring
poetry
and
love
old
people
and
children
it
may
safely
confess
the
writer
strident
admiration
for
compton
mackenzie
hugh
walpole
oliver
onions
lawrence
beresford
gilbert
cannan
patrick
macgill
and
their
peers
whose
novels
are
the
histories
of
our
contemporaneous
golden
age
nor
may
these
be
mentioned
without
a
yet
more
enthusiastic
tribute
to
their
master
and
teacher
he
probably
abominates
being
called
either
a
master
or
a
teacher
wells
the
innocents
chapter
i
and
seth
appleby
were
almost
old
they
called
each
other
father
and
mother
but
frequently
they
were
guilty
of
holding
hands
or
of
cuddling
together
in
corners
and
father
was
a
person
of
stubborn
youthfulness
for
something
over
forty
years
mother
had
been
trying
to
make
him
stop
smoking
yet
every
time
her
back
was
turned
he
would
sneak
out
his
amber
and
puff
a
cheap
cigarette
winking
at
the
shocked
crochet
tidy
on
the
patent
rocker
mother
sniffed
at
him
and
said
that
he
acted
like
a
young
smart
aleck
but
he
would
merely
grin
in
answer
and
coax
her
out
for
a
walk
as
they
paraded
the
sun
shone
through
the
fuzzy
silver
hair
that
puffed
out
round
father
face
and
an
echo
of
delicate
silver
was
on
mother
cheeks
they
were
rustic
as
a
orchard
yet
father
and
mother
had
been
born
in
new
york
city
and
there
lived
for
more
than
sixty
years
father
was
a
perfectly
able
clerk
in
pilkings
on
sixth
avenue
and
pilkings
was
so
much
older
than
father
that
he
still
called
him
hey
you
seth
and
still
gave
him
advice
about
handling
lady
customers
for
three
or
four
years
some
ten
years
back
father
and
pilkings
had
displayed
over
the
passing
of
the
amiable
congress
shoe
but
that
was
practically
forgotten
and
father
began
to
feel
fairly
certain
of
his
job
there
are
three
sorts
of
native
east
side
jews
and
italians
who
will
own
the
city
the
sons
of
families
that
are
so
rich
that
they
swear
off
taxes
and
the
people
descendants
of
shopkeepers
and
clerks
who
often
look
like
and
always
listen
with
timid
admiration
when
from
ohio
or
minnesota
or
california
give
them
information
about
the
city
to
this
meek
race
doing
the
city
work
and
forgotten
by
the
city
they
have
built
belonged
the
applebys
they
lived
in
a
brown
and
dusky
flat
with
a
tabby
and
a
canary
and
a
china
hen
which
held
their
breakfast
boiled
eggs
every
thursday
mother
wrote
to
her
daughter
who
had
married
a
prosperous
and
severely
respectable
druggist
of
saserkopee
new
york
and
during
the
rest
of
her
daytimes
she
swept
and
cooked
and
dusted
went
shyly
along
the
alien
streets
which
had
slipped
into
the
cobblestoned
village
she
had
known
as
a
girl
and
came
back
to
dust
again
and
wait
for
father
nimble
step
on
the
four
flights
of
stairs
up
to
their
flat
she
was
as
used
to
loneliness
as
a
hotel
melancholiac
the
people
they
had
known
had
drifted
away
to
far
suburbs
in
each
other
the
applebys
found
all
life
in
july
father
began
his
annual
agitation
for
a
vacation
pilkings
of
pilkings
son
standard
shoe
parlor
did
believe
in
vacations
he
believed
in
staying
home
and
saving
money
so
every
year
it
was
necessary
for
father
to
develop
a
cough
not
much
of
a
cough
merely
a
small
polite
noise
like
a
mouse
begging
pardon
of
an
irate
bee
yet
enough
to
talk
about
and
win
him
a
two
weeks
leave
every
year
he
schemed
for
this
leave
and
almost
ruined
his
throat
by
sniffing
snuff
to
make
him
sneeze
every
year
pilkings
said
that
he
did
believe
there
was
anything
whatever
the
matter
with
father
and
that
even
if
there
was
he
should
have
a
vacation
every
year
mother
was
frightened
almost
to
death
by
apprehension
that
they
would
be
able
to
get
away
father
laughed
at
her
this
july
till
his
fluffy
hair
shook
like
a
ears
in
he
pounded
his
fist
on
the
prim
by
which
mother
had
been
solemnly
reading
the
in
the
filmco
album
of
funny
film
the
statuettes
of
general
lafayette
and
mozart
on
the
false
mantel
shook
with
his
lusty
thumping
he
roared
till
his
voice
filled
the
and
hollowly
echoed
in
the
porcelain
sink
in
the
kitchen
why
he
declaimed
you
poor
little
dried
codfish
if
it
was
for
me
you
never
have
a
vacation
you
trust
old
dad
to
handle
pilkings
get
away
just
as
sure
as
god
made
little
apples
you
must
use
murmured
mother
undiscouraged
by
forty
years
of
trying
to
reform
father
vocabulary
and
it
would
be
a
just
judgment
on
you
for
your
high
mightiness
if
you
did
get
a
vacation
and
i
do
believe
pilkings
will
give
you
one
either
and
if
it
for
why
i
got
it
right
under
my
hat
yes
you
always
think
you
know
so
much
more
father
rounded
the
table
stealthily
and
treacherously
put
his
lips
at
her
ear
and
blew
a
tremendous
zzzzzzzz
which
buzzed
in
her
ear
like
a
file
on
a
mother
leaped
up
furious
and
snapped
i
simply
ashamed
of
you
the
way
you
act
like
you
never
would
grow
up
and
get
a
little
common
sense
what
with
scaring
me
into
conniption
fits
and
as
i
was
just
going
to
say
and
i
only
say
it
for
your
own
good
if
you
have
got
enough
sense
to
know
how
little
sense
you
have
got
you
at
your
time
of
life
why
well
all
i
can
say
is
you
ought
to
know
better
then
father
and
mother
settled
peacefully
down
and
forgot
all
about
their
disagreement
since
they
had
blessedly
been
relieved
of
the
presence
of
their
talented
daughter
who
until
her
marriage
had
been
polite
to
them
to
such
an
extent
that
for
years
they
had
lived
in
terror
they
had
made
rather
a
point
of
being
naughty
and
noisy
and
happy
together
but
by
and
by
they
would
get
tired
and
look
affectionately
across
the
table
and
purr
father
tinkered
away
at
a
broken
till
suddenly
without
warning
he
declared
that
mother
scolded
him
merely
to
conceal
her
faith
in
his
ability
to
do
anything
she
sniffed
but
she
knew
that
he
was
right
for
years
mother
had
continued
to
believe
in
the
cleverness
of
seth
appleby
who
in
his
youth
had
promised
to
become
manager
of
the
and
gave
the
same
promise
father
justified
his
shameless
boast
by
compelling
pilkings
to
grant
him
the
usual
leave
of
absence
and
they
prepared
to
start
for
west
skipsit
cape
cod
where
they
always
spent
their
vacations
at
the
of
uncle
joe
tubbs
mother
took
a
week
to
pack
and
unpack
to
go
panting
to
the
corner
for
new
tubes
of
and
a
presentable
sponge
to
remend
all
that
was
remendable
to
press
father
flappy
shapeless
little
trousers
with
the
family
to
worry
over
whether
she
should
take
the
or
the
wrapper
which
had
both
faded
to
approximately
the
same
shade
of
gray
but
which
were
to
her
trusting
mind
still
interestingly
different
each
year
she
had
to
impress
tubbs
of
west
skipsit
with
new
metropolitan
finery
and
this
year
father
had
no
peace
nor
comfort
in
the
m√©nage
till
she
had
selected
a
smart
new
hat
incredibly
small
and
close
and
sinking
coyly
down
over
her
ear
he
was
only
a
man
folk
he
was
in
the
way
incapable
of
understanding
this
problem
of
fashion
and
mother
almost
slapped
him
one
evening
for
suggesting
that
it
would
make
such
a
lot
of
difference
if
she
did
find
some
new
fad
to
impress
sister
tubbs
but
mother
wearied
of
repacking
their
two
cheap
wicker
and
the
brown
pasteboard
box
and
father
suddenly
came
to
the
front
in
his
true
capacity
as
boss
and
leader
he
announced
loudly
on
the
evening
before
they
were
to
depart
we
going
to
have
a
party
old
lady
at
the
masterful
tones
of
this
man
of
the
world
who
was
afraid
of
train
or
travel
who
had
gone
successfully
through
the
mysteries
of
purchasing
transportation
clear
to
cape
cod
mother
looked
impressed
but
she
said
doubtfully
oh
do
you
think
we
better
father
we
be
traveling
and
all
we
going
to
a
movie
and
then
we
going
to
have
a
banana
split
and
i
going
to
carry
my
cane
and
smoke
a
seegar
you
know
mighty
well
you
like
the
movies
as
well
as
i
do
acting
up
like
a
young
smarty
mother
said
but
she
obediently
put
on
her
hat
lord
no
not
the
new
small
hat
that
was
kept
to
impress
west
skipsit
massachusetts
and
as
she
trotted
to
the
movies
beside
him
the
two
of
them
like
solemn
white
puppies
venturing
away
from
their
mother
she
occasionally
looked
admiringly
up
a
whole
inch
up
at
her
hero
chapter
ii
they
took
the
steamer
for
massachusetts
at
five
when
the
band
started
to
play
when
mother
feared
that
a
ferry
was
going
to
collide
with
them
when
beautiful
youths
in
boating
hats
popped
out
of
like
in
a
musical
comedy
when
children
banged
small
when
the
steamer
rounded
the
of
lower
new
york
when
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
the
could
get
under
brooklyn
bridge
which
did
clear
it
by
much
more
than
a
hundred
feet
when
a
totally
new
new
york
of
factories
and
docks
of
steamers
bound
for
ceylon
and
yachts
bound
for
newport
was
revealed
to
these
old
then
mother
mingled
a
terrific
apprehension
regarding
ships
and
water
with
a
palpitating
excitement
over
sailing
into
the
freedom
which
these
two
children
had
longed
for
all
their
lives
and
had
found
during
two
weeks
of
each
year
father
was
perfectly
tremendous
he
apprehensive
why
he
might
have
been
the
original
man
to
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
mother
wailed
that
all
the
had
been
taken
father
found
mountains
of
chairs
and
flipped
a
couple
of
them
open
as
though
he
were
a
steward
with
service
stripes
he
was
simply
immense
in
his
manner
of
thrusting
mother
and
himself
and
his
chairs
and
a
mound
of
shawls
and
coats
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
gathered
at
the
bow
he
noted
mother
nervousness
and
observed
casually
mighty
safe
these
boats
like
ferries
safer
trains
yes
they
safer
staying
home
in
bed
what
with
burgulars
and
fires
and
everything
oh
do
you
really
think
they
are
safe
breathed
mother
comforted
admirable
though
father
was
he
could
sit
still
he
was
wearing
a
decorative
new
traveling
cap
very
smart
and
extensive
and
expensive
shaped
like
a
muffin
and
patterned
with
the
douglas
tartan
and
an
etruscan
border
he
rather
wanted
to
let
people
see
it
he
was
no
pilkings
clerk
now
but
a
with
his
cap
clapped
down
on
one
side
and
his
youthful
cocked
up
on
the
other
and
in
his
buttonhole
a
carnation
jaunty
as
a
red
pompon
with
the
breeze
puffing
out
the
light
silver
hair
about
his
temples
and
his
pink
cheeks
glowing
in
the
westering
sun
he
promenaded
round
and
round
the
and
stopped
to
pat
a
whimpering
child
but
always
he
hastened
back
lest
mother
get
frightened
or
lonely
once
he
imagined
that
two
toughs
were
annoying
her
and
he
glared
at
them
like
a
sparrow
robbed
of
a
crumb
as
he
escorted
her
into
the
father
back
was
straight
his
chin
very
high
he
was
so
prosperous
of
aspect
so
generous
and
proudly
affectionate
that
people
turned
to
look
it
was
obvious
that
if
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
shoe
business
he
must
be
a
manufacturer
in
a
large
way
with
and
model
cottages
the
sun
went
down
long
island
sound
was
shot
with
red
gold
as
little
waves
reached
up
hands
at
the
wonder
of
light
father
and
mother
gazed
and
ate
chocolate
and
large
quantities
of
cake
with
the
na√Øve
relish
of
people
who
usually
dine
at
home
they
sat
on
deck
till
mother
yawned
and
nodded
and
at
last
said
the
which
always
means
let
go
to
bed
father
had
so
inspired
her
with
faith
in
the
comparative
safety
of
their
wild
voyaging
that
she
was
no
longer
afraid
but
just
sleepy
she
nestled
in
her
chair
and
smiled
shamefacedly
and
said
it
only
nine
but
somehow
in
her
drowsiness
the
wrinkles
smoothed
away
from
round
her
eyes
and
left
her
face
like
that
of
a
plump
tired
happy
little
girl
when
they
were
at
home
father
and
mother
garments
had
a
way
of
getting
so
familiarly
mixed
that
even
mother
could
scarcely
keep
their
bureau
drawers
separate
but
when
they
traveled
they
were
aristocrats
and
they
had
entirely
separate
and
berths
from
the
pompous
manner
in
which
father
unpacked
his
bag
you
would
have
been
utterly
beguiled
and
have
supposed
him
to
be
one
of
those
high
persons
who
have
whole
suites
to
themselves
and
see
their
consorts
only
at
state
banquets
when
there
are
celery
and
olives
and
the
squire
invited
to
dinner
there
was
nothing
these
partners
in
life
more
enjoyed
than
the
one
night
pretense
that
they
were
aloof
but
they
suddenly
forgot
their
r√¥les
they
squealed
with
pleasure
and
patted
each
shoulders
fondly
for
simultaneously
they
had
discovered
the
surprises
in
mother
inside
her
boots
father
had
hidden
four
slender
beribboned
boxes
of
the
very
best
chocolate
peppermints
while
in
father
seemly
nightgown
was
a
magnificent
new
father
was
an
artist
on
the
he
could
set
your
heart
prancing
with
the
strains
of
dandy
dick
and
the
candlestick
but
his
old
had
grown
wheezy
now
he
sat
down
and
played
softly
till
their
tiny
inside
was
filled
with
a
tumbling
chorus
of
happy
notes
when
mother
was
asleep
in
the
lower
berth
and
father
was
believed
to
be
asleep
in
the
upper
he
slipped
on
his
coat
and
trousers
and
out
of
the
to
a
dark
corner
of
the
deck
for
very
secretly
father
was
afraid
of
the
water
he
who
had
insouciantly
reassured
mother
had
himself
to
choke
down
the
timorous
speculations
of
a
clerk
while
the
sun
was
fair
on
the
water
and
there
were
obviously
no
leviathans
nor
anything
like
that
bearing
down
upon
them
he
was
able
to
conceal
his
fear
even
from
himself
but
now
that
he
have
to
cheer
mother
now
that
the
boat
rolled
forward
through
a
black
nothingness
he
knew
that
he
was
afraid
he
sat
huddled
and
remembered
all
the
tales
he
had
heard
of
fire
and
collision
and
reefs
he
vainly
assured
himself
that
every
was
provided
with
an
automatic
sprinkler
he
made
encouraging
calculations
as
to
the
infrequency
of
collisions
on
the
sound
and
scoffed
at
himself
why
the
most
shipping
there
could
be
at
night
would
be
a
couple
of
schooners
maybe
a
but
dread
of
the
unknown
was
on
him
father
went
through
this
spasm
of
solitary
fear
each
first
night
of
vacation
it
was
genuine
fear
it
was
the
of
freedom
the
cricket
who
chirped
so
gaily
when
he
was
with
mother
was
also
a
weary
man
a
prisoner
of
daily
routine
he
had
to
become
free
for
freedom
laughingly
then
bitterly
he
rebuked
himself
for
fear
and
presently
he
was
bespelled
by
the
wonder
of
the
unknown
beyond
the
water
through
which
they
slid

light
great
gull
island
it
suggested
to
him
thunderous
cliffs
with
surf
flung
up
on
beetling
rock
screaming
gulls
and
a
smuggler
on
guard
with
menacing

he
lost
his
fear
of
fear
he
ceased
to
think
about
his
accustomed
life
of
two
aisles

the
of
new
models

the

of
boxes

boxes
and
boxes
of
shoes

was

deeply

not

must
be
confessed
in

nuzzled

they
changed
from

to
railroad
about
eleven
in
the
morning
they
stepped
out
at
west
skipsit
cape
cod
uncle
joe
tubbs
and
tubbs
were
driving
up
in
a
country
buggy
father
and
mother
filled
their
nostrils
with
the
smell
of
the
salt
marshes
their
ears
with
the
long
murmur
of
the
surf
their
eyes
with
the
shine
of
the
great
dunes
and
the
demure
peace
of
a
new
england
white
cottage
standing
among
firs
and
scent
and
sound
and
sight
of
their
freedom
father
we
here
mother
whispered
her
eyes
wet
then
oh
do
be
careful
of
that
box
there
a
hat
there
that
going
to
make
matilda
tubbs
catch
her
death
from
envy
to
the
tubbses
though
they
were
cynical
with
a
hoary
wisdom
in
regard
to
and
summerites
and
boarders
in
general
the
annual
coming
of
the
applebys
was
welcome
as
cider
and
buttered
toast
yes
they
even
gave
father
and
mother
the
best
chamber
with
the
bed
and
the
mirror
bordered
with
florida
shells
at
a
much
reduced
rate
they
burrowed
into
their
grim
old
hearts
as
uncle
joe
tubbs
grubbed
into
the
mud
for
clams
and
brought
out
treasures
of
shy
affection
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
tubbs
the
two
women
went
off
together
to
the
kitchen
while
the
men
sneaked
toward
the
inlet
mother
did
show
her
new
hat
as
yet
that
was
in
reserve
to
tantalize
tubbs
with
the
waiting
besides
for
a
day
or
two
the
women
take
down
the
bars
and
say
what
they
thought
but
the
men
immediately
pounded
each
other
on
the
back
and
called
each
other
seth
and
joe
and
keeping
behind
banks
lest
they
be
seen
by
young
uns
they
shamefacedly
paddled
barefoot
two
old
men
with
bare
feet
and
silvery
shanks
chuckling
and
catching
crabs
in
a
salt
inlet
among
rolling
hillocks
covered
with
that
lisped
in
the
breeze
the
grass
hollows
were
filled
with
quiet
and
the
sound
of
hovering
flies
beyond
was
a
hill
shiny
with
laurel
they
dug
for
clams
in
the
mud
by
the
pond
they
discussed
the
cranberry
bog
and
the
war
and
the
daily
catch
of
the
traps
they
interrupted
their
sage
discourse
to
whoop
at
a
mackerel
gull
that
flapped
above
them
they
prowled
along
the
inlet
to
the
outside
and
like
officials
they
viewed
a
passing
uncle
joe
tubbs
ought
to
have
been
washing
dishes
and
he
knew
it
but
the
coming
of
the
applebys
annually
gave
him
the
excuse
for
a
complete
loaf
besides
he
was
sure
that
by
now
mother
appleby
would
be
in
apron
and
gingham
helping
the
protesting
yet
willing
tubbs
the
greatest
philosophical
theory
in
the
world
is
that
people
are
people
the
applebys
who
had
mellowed
among
streets
and
shops
were
very
much
like
the
tubbses
of
cape
cod
father
was
in
his
unquenchable
fondness
for
mother
like
romeo
like
golden
aucassin
but
also
in
his
sly
fondness
for
loafing
on
a
sunny
smoking
a
vile
pipe
and
arguing
that
the
war
could
last
more
than
six
months
he
was
very
much
like
uncle
joe
tubbs
as
for
mother
she
gossiped
about
the
ancient
feud
between
the
west
skipsit
universalists
and
methodists
and
she
said
exactly
like
tubbs
there
were
other
boarders
at
the
tubbses
and
before
them
at
supper
both
of
the
old
couples
maintained
the
gravity
with
which
vainly
age
always
endeavors
to
impress
youth
uncle
joe
was
crotchety
and
tubbs
was
brisk
about
the
butter
and
the
applebys
were
tremendously
dignified
and
washed
and
brushed
and
not
averse
to
being
known
as
superior
star
boarders
from
that
superior
city
new
york
personages
to
whom
the
opera
and
the
were
perfectly
familiar
father
dismissed
a
small
amateurish
war
debate
by
letting
it
be
known
that
in
his
business
nature
of
business
not
stated
he
was
accustomed
to
meet
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
very
choicest
nations
and
to
give
them
advice
which
indeed
he
did
regarding
shoes
for
pilkings
son
had
a
rather
√©lite
clientele
for
sixth
avenue
and
father
had
with
his
own
hands
made
glad
the
feet
of
the
swedish
consul
and
the
bolivian
trade
agent
a
man
from
south
bromfield
started
to
cap
the
pose
as
low
persons
always
do
in
these
but
father
changed
the
subject
in
a
slightly
peppery
manner
father
could
be
playful
with
mother
but
like
all
men
who
are
worth
anything
he
could
be
as
olympian
as
a
king
or
a
woman
author
or
a
manager
when
he
was
afflicted
by
young
men
who
chewed
gum
and
were
chatty
he
put
his
on
the
end
of
his
nose
and
looked
over
them
so
wealthily
that
the
summerites
were
awed
and
shyly
ate
their
to
the
last
dreg
twelve
dinner
at
the
tubbses
was
a
very
respectable
meal
with
roasts
and
vegetables
to
which
you
could
devote
some
skill
and
energy
but
supper
was
more
like
an
a
sort
of
afternoon
tea
without
the
conversation
it
was
soon
over
the
dishes
soon
washed
and
by
seven
the
applebys
and
tubbses
gathered
in
the
sacred
parlor
where
ordinary
summerites
were
not
welcome
where
the
family
hung
above
the
green
plush
settee
from
boston
which
was
flanked
by
the
teak
table
which
uncle
joe
uncle
ira
had
brought
from
china
and
the
whale
vertebr√¶
without
which
no
cape
cod
household
is
virtuous
with
joy
and
verbal
fireworks
with
highly
insulting
comments
on
one
another
play
began
the
annual
series
of
cribbage
games
a
world
series
a
davis
cup
tournament
doffing
his
usual
collarless
jocose
manner
uncle
joe
reverently
took
from
the
the
ancestral
carved
from
a
solid
they
stood
about
exclaiming
over
it
then
fell
to
and
a
pair
is
six
rang
out
triumphantly
finally
as
happened
every
year
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
game
when
the
men
had
magnificently
won
tubbs
surprised
them
with
refreshments
they
would
have
been
jolly
well
surprised
if
she
had
surprised
them
and
father
played
recent
new
york
musical
comedy
songs
on
his
new
stopping
to
explain
the
point
of
each
whereupon
mother
shook
her
head
and
said
warningly
now
father
you
be
careful
what
you
say
honestly
i
do
know
what
the
world
is
coming
to
tubbs
the
way
men
carry
on
nowadays
but
she
was
very
earnest
about
it
because
she
was
gigglingly
aware
that
uncle
joe
was
stealing
tubbs
share
of
the
doughnuts
they
were
all
as
hysterical
as
a
girls
school
during
this
annual
celebration
but
father
peeped
out
of
the
parlor
window
and
saw
the
lush
moonlight
on
marsh
and
field
to
mother
with
an
awed
quiet
sarah
it
moonlight
like
it
used
to
be
the
tubbses
seemed
to
understand
that
the
sweethearts
wanted
to
be
alone
and
they
made
excuses
to
be
off
to
bed
on
the
porch
wrapped
in
comforters
and
coats
against
the
seaside
chill
father
and
mother
cuddled
together
they
said
little
everything
was
said
for
them
by
the
moonlight
silvery
on
the
marshes
wistful
silver
among
the
dunes
while
the
surf
was
lulled
and
the
whole
spacious
night
seemed
reverent
with
love
his
hand
cradled
hers
as
the
hand
of
a
child
would
close
round
a
lily
leaf
halcyon
days
of
sitting
in
under
the
on
afternoons
of
hunting
for
shells
on
the
shore
of
the
cape
of
fishing
for
whiting
from
the
landing
on
the
bay
side
of
musing
among
the
grasses
of
the
uplands
they
would
have
gone
ambling
along
such
dreamland
roads
to
the
end
of
their
vacation
had
it
not
been
for
the
of
uncle
joe
that
car
changed
their
entire
life
among
the
hills
of
peace
there
was
waiting
for
them
an
adventure
uncle
joe
lived
in
a
portable
bungalow
a
mile
away
he
rotated
crops
he
peddled
fish
with
a
in
five
minutes
he
could
detach
from
the
back
of
his
car
the
box
in
which
he
carried
the
fish
clap
on
a
rather
rickety
tonneau
and
be
ready
to
compete
in
stylish
pleasures
with
the
largest
limousine
from
newport
or
brookline
father
and
mother
went
wheezing
about
the
country
with
him
father
had
always
felt
that
he
had
the
makings
of
a
motorist
because
of
the
distinct
pleasure
he
had
felt
in
rides
on
new
york
sundays
and
he
tactfully
encouraged
the
in
the
touring
mania
so
it
was
really
father
fault
that
they
found
the
the
six
of
them
the
applebys
the
tubbses
and
and
daughter
somewhat
cramped
as
to
space
and
dusty
as
to
garments
had
motored
to
cotagansuit
before
them
out
across
the
road
hung
the
sign
ye
tea
shoppe
say
by
jiminy
let
go
into
that
tea
shoppy
and
have
some
eats
said
father
my
treat
nope
it
mine
said
the
tubbses
hypocritically
not
a
word
out
of
you
sang
out
father
gallantly
hey
there
chauffeur
stop
this
new
car
of
mine
at
the
shoppy
as
the
rusty
car
drew
up
tubbs
and
mother
looked
rather
agitatedly
at
a
group
of
young
people
girls
in
smocks
and
men
in
white
flannels
who
were
making
society
noises
before
the
brown
barn
which
had
been
turned
into
a
the
two
old
women
felt
that
they
were
quite
dressed
for
a
party
they
were
shy
of
silken
youth
daughter
was
conscious
of
the
fact
that
her
shapeless
from
many
washings
was
soiled
in
front
but
uncle
joe
the
old
hardshell
was
never
abashed
at
anything
he
shifted
his
tobacco
quid
and
guessed
he
have
to
get
some
white
pants
like
that
young
fellow
then
father
again
proved
himself
magnificent
was
he
a
no
flossy
and
no
bunch
of
young
fellows
in
breeches
probably
they
were
only
clerks
anyway
if
the
truth
was
known
was
going
to
scare
your
uncle
dudley
offn
tea
not
that
he
cared
so
much
for
tea
itself
have
a
good
cup
of
coffee
any
time
but
he
did
want
joe
tubbs
to
think
he
was
used
to
fashionable
folks
so
with
a
manner
of
wearing
goggles
and
gauntlets
he
led
the
women
and
the
shambling
and
the
brazenly
sloppy
uncle
joe
through
the
flowery
youth
and
into
the
raftered
room
with
its
new
fireplace
and
old
william
and
mary
chairs
its
highboy
covered
with
brassware
and
its
little
with
slender
handicraft
vases
each
containing
one
marigold
father
ignored
all
these
elegances
and
commanded
a
disdainful
waitress
with
a
frilly
white
apron
let
have
a
couple
of
tables
together
here
eh
he
himself
shifted
chairs
and
made
a
joke
and
started
to
select
impressive
food
he
was
used
to
new
york
restaurants
and
to
quite
expensive
hotels
for
at
least
once
a
year
on
his
birthday
pilkings
took
him
to
lunch
at
the
waldorf
while
he
had
apparently
been
devoting
himself
to
arranging
the
tables
his
cunning
old
brain
had
determined
to
order
tea
and
french
pastry
apparently
the
tea
shoppe
was
neutral
there
was
no
french
pastry
on
the
bill
but
instead
such
curious
edibles
as
cinnamon
toast
cream
cheese
walnut
sandwiches
martha
washington
muffins
nor
was
the
tea
problem
so
easy
as
it
had
seemed
to
father
there
were
only
two
kinds
of
tea
the
kind
you
got
for
a
nickel
at
the
automat
and
the
kind
that
mother
privately
consumed
but
here
he
had
to
choose
intelligently
among
orange
pekoe
oolong
ceylon
and
teas
father
did
a
very
brave
thing
though
he
probably
will
never
get
the
carnegie
medal
for
it
instead
of
timidly
asking
the
lofty
advice
he
boldly
plunged
in
and
ordered
two
kinds
of
sandwiches
cinnamon
toast
and
because
he
liked
the
name
orange
pekoe
he
rather
held
his
breath
but
apparently
the
waitress
took
him
quite
seriously
and
some
time
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
actually
brought
him
what
he
had
asked
for
ye
tea
shoppe
was
artistic
you
could
tell
that
by
the
fact
that
none
of
the
arts
and
crafts
wares
exposed
for
sale
were
in
the
least
useful
and
it
was
too
artistic
too
far
above
the
sordidness
of
commercialism
to
put
any
prices
on
the
consequently
father
was
worried
about
his
bill
all
the
time
he
was
encouraging
his
guests
to
forget
their
uncomfortably
decorative
surroundings
and
talk
like
regular
people
but
when
he
saw
how
skinny
were
the
sandwiches
and
how
reticent
the
cinnamon
toast
he
was
cheered
he
calculated
that
the
whole
bill
could
in
decency
be
more
than
ninety
cents
for
the
six
of
them
in
the
midst
of
his
nicest
flow
of
fancy
about
mother
fear
of
mice
the
bill
was
laid
decorously
on
its
face
beside
him
still
talking
but
hesitating
somewhat
he
took
a
peep
at
the
bill
it
was
for
three
dollars
and
sixty
cents
he
felt
congealed
but
he
talked
on
he
slid
a
bill
from
his
diminutive
roll
and
gallantly
paid
up
his
only
comment
when
in
the
car
mother
secretly
asked
how
much
he
had
been
overcharged
was
the
reflection
they
certainly
ought
to
make
money
out
of
those
their
profit
must
be
something
like
five
hundred
per
cent
that
strikes
me
as
a
pretty
good
way
to
earn
a
living
old
lady
you
live
in
a
nice
comfortable
place
in
the
country
and
do
have
to
do
any
work
but
slice
bread
and
stick
in
chicken
or
cream
cheese
and
make
five
hundred
per
cent
say
chapter
iv
he
did
say
it
but
father
had
been
knocked
breathless
by
an
idea
he
was
silent
all
the
way
home
he
made
figures
on
the
last
leaf
of
his
little
pocket
he
manoeuvered
to
get
mother
alone
and
exultantly
shot
his
idea
at
her
they
were
beginning
to
get
old
the
city
was
almost
too
much
for
them
they
would
pick
out
some
pretty
rustic
spot
and
invest
their
savings
in
a
at
per
cent
they
would
make
enough
during
three
months
of
summer
to
keep
them
the
rest
of
the
year
if
they
were
located
on
cape
cod
perhaps
they
could
spend
the
winter
with
the
tubbses
they
would
have
a
garden
they
would
keep
chickens
dogs
pussies
yes
a
cow
they
would
buy
land
acre
by
acre
they
would
have
a
farm
to
sustain
them
when
they
were
too
old
for
work
maybe
they
would
open
a
whole
chain
of
and
ride
about
supervising
them
in
a
big
as
a
house
they
would
now
hold
your
horses
father
she
begged
dizzily
i
never
did
see
such
a
man
for
running
on
you
go
on
like
a
house
afire
you
ought
to
know
more
at
your
time
of
life
than
to
go
counting
your
chickens
before
i
going
to
hatch
them
do
they
tell
us
in
every
newspaper
and
magazine
you
can
lay
your
hand
on
that
this
is
the
age
of
the
man
with
the
idea
look
here
two
slices
of
bread
i
cost
more
than
of
a
cent
i
should
think
and
cream
cheese
to
smear
on
them
about
half
a
cent
there
a
little
over
a
cent
and
overhead
would
take
overhead
into
account
and
then
you
go
and
say
i
ai
practical
and
hatching
chickens
and
all
but
let
me
tell
you
sarah
jane
appleby
i
a
business
man
and
been
trained
and
i
tell
you
as
pilkings
has
often
said
to
me
overhead
that
makes
or
breaks
a
business
that
what
it
is
just
like
he
says
yes
sir
so
say
we
allow
now
let
me
see
ten
plus
ten
is
twenty
and
one
of
twenty
would
be
six
in
two
is
no
two
in
six
is
well
to
make
it
safe
we
allow
a
cent
and
a
half
for
each
sandwich
to
cover
overhead
and
rent
and
fuel
and
then
they
sell
a
sandwich
at
fifteen
cents
which
is
uh
the
way
they
figure
percentage
of
profit
well
make
it
say
seven
hundred
per
just
estimating
roughly
like
now
can
you
beat
that
and
is
a
safe
sound
interesting
genteel
business
if
there
ever
was
one
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
that
father
did
often
thus
deluge
her
with
words
but
then
he
did
often
have
a
revolutionary
idea
she
had
never
heard
of
overhead
and
she
was
impressed
though
in
some
dim
confused
way
she
rather
associated
overhead
with
the
rafters
of
the
she
emerged
gasping
from
the
shower
and
all
she
could
say
was
yes
it
would
be
very
genteel
and
i
must
say
i
always
did
like
them
artistic
things
but
do
you
really
think
it
would
be
safe
father
safe
pooh
safe
the
bank
they
were
in
for
it
of
course
they
were
going
to
discuss
it
back
and
forth
for
months
and
sit
up
nights
to
make
figures
on
the
backs
of
but
they
had
been
fated
the
moment
father
had
seen
mother
and
himself
as
delightful
hosts
playing
with
people
in
silk
sweaters
in
a
general
atmosphere
of
roses
fresh
lobster
and
gentility
they
explored
the
cape
for
miles
around
looking
for
a
place
where
they
might
open
a
if
they
did
decide
to
do
so
they
said
to
the
tubbses
and
returned
to
new
york
to
the
noisy
streets
and
the
thankless
drudgery
at
pilkings
son
in
december
they
definitely
made
up
their
minds
to
give
up
the
shoe
business
take
their
few
hundred
dollars
from
the
bank
and
the
coming
summer
open
a
in
an
old
on
the
cliffs
at
grimsby
head
cape
cod
out
of
saving
money
for
the
that
winter
the
applebys
had
as
much
fun
as
they
had
ever
found
in
spending
they
were
comrades
partners
in
getting
along
without
things
as
they
had
been
partners
in
working
to
acquire
little
luxuries
they
went
to
the
movies
only
once
a
month
that
made
the
movies
only
the
more
thrilling
on
the
morning
before
they
were
to
go
father
would
pound
softly
on
the
pillow
by
mother
head
and
sing
wake
up
it
a
fine
day
and
we
going
to
see
a
photoplay
mother
did
without
her
chocolate
peppermints
and
father
cut
his
smoking
down
to
one
cigarette
after
each
meal
though
occasionally
being
but
a
mortal
man
he
would
fall
into
sinful
ways
and
smoke
up
three
or
four
cigarettes
while
engaged
in
an
enthralling
conversation
regarding
pilkings
meanness
with
at
lunch
at
the
automat
afterward
he
would
be
very
repentant
he
would
have
a
severe
case
of
conviction
of
sin
and
mother
would
have
to
comfort
him
when
he
accused
himself
seems
as
if
i
could
doggone
never
learn
to
control
myself
i
hopeless
am
i
i
declare
i
disgusted
with
myself
when
i
think
of
your
going
without
your
chocolates
and
me
just
making
a
profane
old
razorback
hog
of
myself
there
was
no
sordidness
in
their
minute
economy
no
chill
of
poverty
they
were
saving
for
an
excursion
to
paradise
they
crowed
as
they
thought
of
the
beauty
of
their
discovery
lonely
grimsby
head
where
the
sea
stretched
out
on
one
side
of
their
house
and
moors
on
the
other
with
the
state
road
and
its
motorists
only
two
hundred
feet
from
their
door
though
they
should
live
in
that
sentinel
house
for
years
never
would
they
enjoy
it
more
than
they
now
did
in
anticipation
when
they
sat
of
an
evening
in
their
brown
flat
looking
down
on
a
delicatessen
a
laundry
and
a
and
planned
to
invest
in
their
house
of
accomplished
dreams
the
nickels
they
were
managing
to
save
the
only
thing
that
worried
father
was
the
fact
that
their
project
put
upon
mother
so
great
a
burden
in
the
way
of
preparations
at
first
he
took
it
for
granted
that
only
women
could
know
about
tea
and
decorations
and
paper
napkins
and
art
and
the
disposal
of
garbage
he
determined
to
learn
by
dint
of
much
deep
ratiocination
while
riding
in
the
elevated
between
flat
and
store
he
evolved
the
new
idea
cheapness
it
was
nonsense
he
decided
to
have
china
and
to
charge
fifteen
cents
for
tea
why
not
have
neat
inexpensive
china
good
but
not
exorbitant
tea
and
charge
only
five
or
ten
cents
as
did
the
numerous
he
knew
mother
eagerly
agreed
then
the
man
of
ideas
began
to
turn
his
brain
to
saving
mother
the
trouble
of
selecting
the
equipment
it
was
not
an
easy
problem
for
him
this
gallant
traveler
who
wore
his
cap
so
cockily
and
paid
a
check
so
nonchalantly
when
he
was
traveling
was
really
an
underpaid
clerk
he
began
by
informing
himself
on
all
the
technicalities
of
he
lunched
at
he
prowled
in
front
of
he
dreamed
about
he
became
a
dabster
at
tucking
paper
napkins
into
his
neat
little
waistcoat
without
tearing
them
he
got
acquainted
with
the
waitress
at
the
nickleby
tavern
which
was
not
a
tavern
though
it
was
consciously
painstakingly
seriously
quaint
and
he
cautiously
made
inquiry
of
her
regarding
tea
and
china
during
his
he
frequented
auction
sales
on
sixth
avenue
and
became
so
sophisticated
in
the
matter
of
goods
that
the
youngest
clerk
at
pilkings
son
a
child
of
forty
who
was
about
to
be
married
respectfully
asked
father
about
furnishing
a
flat
he
rampaged
through
department
stores
without
buying
a
thing
till
store
detectives
secretly
followed
him
he
read
the
advertisements
in
his
morning
paper
before
he
even
looked
at
the
father
was
no
fool
but
he
had
been
known
to
prefer
kindliness
to
convenience
when
he
could
get
things
for
the
same
price
he
liked
to
buy
them
from
small
struggling
dealers
rather
than
from
large
and
efficient
ones
thereby
in
his
innocent
way
helping
to
perpetuate
the
old
system
of
weak
unskilled
casual
chaotically
competitive
businesses
this
kindliness
moved
him
when
during
his
search
for
information
about
accessories
he
encountered
a
feeble
but
pretentious
which
a
young
hungarian
had
established
on
street
just
off
sixth
avenue
the
hungarian
and
one
girl
assistant
were
trying
by
futile
garish
to
draw
trade
from
the
great
department
stores
and
the
stores
on
one
side
of
them
and
the
smart
shops
on
the
other
side
but
the
hungarian
was
clever
too
clever
he
first
found
out
all
of
father
plans
then
won
sympathy
he
coughed
a
little
and
with
a
touching
smile
which
was
intended
to
rouse
admiration
declared
that
his
lungs
were
bad
but
never
mind
he
would
fight
on
and
go
away
for
a
rest
when
he
had
succeeded
he
insinuated
that
as
he
was
not
busy
now
he
could
do
all
the
buying
and
get
better
terms
from
wholesalers
or
bankruptcy
bargain
sales
than
could
father
himself
the
hungarian
best
stock
in
trading
with
father
was
to
look
young
and
pathetically
threadbare
to
smile
and
shake
his
head
and
say
playfully
as
though
he
were
trying
to
hide
his
secret
generosity
by
a
pretense
of
severity
but
of
course
i
charge
you
a
commission
you
see
i
a
fella
it
was
january
in
a
month
now
mother
would
be
grunting
heavily
and
beginning
the
labor
of
buying
for
the
so
far
she
had
done
nothing
but
crochet
two
or
three
million
tidies
for
the
chairs
to
make
them
look
homey
the
hungarian
showed
father
with
huge
quantities
of
gold
on
them
he
assured
father
that
it
was
smarter
to
buy
odd
cups
also
cheaper
as
thus
they
could
take
advantage
of
broken
lots
and
sales
fascinated
father
kept
hanging
around
and
at
last
he
bolted
frantically
and
authorized
the
hungarian
to
purchase
everything
for
him
which
the
hungarian
had
already
done
knowing
that
the
fly
was
on
the
edge
of
the
web
you
know
the
things
did
look
so
bad
not
so
very
bad
as
long
as
they
were
new
and
saucers
gilded
like
and
equally
thick
chairs
of
patterns
with
backs
of
heppelwhite
chairs
of
cane
and
rattan
with
fussy
scrolls
and
curlicues
of
wicker
the
backs
set
askew
reed
tables
with
gollops
of
wicker
plain
black
wooden
tables
that
were
like
kitchen
tables
once
removed
that
may
have
been
suitable
to
if
you
did
play
anything
more
exciting
than
casino
flat
silver
that
was
heavily
plated
except
where
it
was
likely
to
wear
of
mottled
glaze
and
with
knobs
of
gilt
and
square
china
on
which
one
instinctively
expected
to
find
the
legend
souvenir
of
niagara
falls
too
many
and
too
few
dark
blue
plates
with
warts
on
the
edges
and
melancholy
landscapes
painted
in
the
centers
chintzes
and
of
patterns
fashionable
in
that
had
the
most
inspiring
labels
cocoa
that
was
bitter
and
pepper
that
was
mild
preserves
that
were
generous
with
hayseed
and
glucose
but
everything
was
varnished
that
could
be
varnished
everything
was
tied
with
pink
ribbon
that
would
stand
for
it
the
whole
collection
looked
impressively
new
to
a
man
accustomed
to
a
shabby
flat
the
prices
seemed
reasonable
and
mother
was
saved
practically
all
the
labor
of
buying
she
had
clucked
comfortably
every
time
he
had
worried
aloud
about
her
task
yet
she
was
secretly
troubled
it
gave
her
a
headache
to
climb
down
the
four
flights
of
stairs
from
their
flat
the
acrid
dust
of
the
city
streets
stung
her
eyes
the
dissonant
grumble
of
a
million
hurrying
noises
dizzied
her
and
she
would
stand
on
a
for
five
minutes
before
daring
to
cross
when
father
told
her
that
all
the
buying
was
done
and
awaiting
her
approval
she
gasped
but
she
went
down
with
him
was
impressed
by
the
shininess
and
newness
of
things
and
the
hungarian
was
given
a
good
share
of
the
applebys
agitatedly
taken
out
of
the
in
specie
they
had
purchased
freedom
the
house
at
grimsby
head
was
eager
for
them
mother
cried
as
she
ripped
up
the
carpet
in
their
familiar
flat
and
saw
the
treasured
furniture
rudely
crated
for
shipment
to
the
unknown
she
felt
that
she
was
giving
up
ever
so
many
metropolitan
advantages
by
leaving
new
york
so
prematurely
why
she
never
been
inside
grant
tomb
she
miss
her
second
cousin
not
that
she
seen
the
cousin
for
a
year
or
two
and
on
the
desert
moors
of
grimsby
she
could
run
across
the
street
to
a
delicatessen
but
none
of
the
inconveniences
of
going
away
so
weighed
upon
her
spirit
as
did
the
memory
of
their
hours
together
in
this
flat
but
when
she
stood
with
him
on
the
steamer
again
bound
for
the
cape
when
the
spring
breeze
gave
life
to
her
faded
hair
she
straightened
her
shoulders
and
stood
like
a
conqueror
gee
we
be
at
grimsby
piped
father
throwing
his
coat
open
and
debonairly
sticking
his
thumbs
into
his
lower
waistcoat
pockets
the
easy
life
for
me
old
lady
i
going
to
sit
in
a
chair
in
the
sun
and
watch
you
work
how
you
do
run
on
she
said
you
wait
and
find
out
the
way
you
have
to
wash
dishes
and
all
we
see
what
we
see
my
fine
young
whiffet
say
james
jerusalem
but
i
got
a
fine
idea
i
know
what
call
the
t
room
see
not
spelling
out
the
great
eh
chapter
v
it
was
may
in
arcady
and
those
old
lovers
and
seth
appleby
were
almost
ready
to
open
the
they
had
leased
for
a
term
of
two
years
an
ancient
and
weathered
house
on
the
gravel
cliffs
of
grimsby
head
from
the
cliffs
the
ocean
seemed
more
sweepingly
vast
than
when
beheld
from
the
beach
and
the
plain
of
it
was
colored
like
a
pearly
shell
to
the
other
side
of
their
were
moors
that
might
have
been
transplanted
from
devon
rolling
uplands
covered
with
wiry
grass
that
was
springy
to
the
feet
dappled
with
lichens
which
gave
to
the
spacious
land
its
lovely
splashes
of
color
rose
and
green
and
sulphur
and
quiet
gray
it
was
a
lonely
countryside
the
nearest
signs
of
human
life
were
a
church
gauntly
silhouetted
on
the
hill
above
grimsby
center
two
miles
away
and
a
station
squat
and
slapped
down
in
a
hollow
of
the
cliffs
but
near
the
applebys
door
ran
the
state
road
black
and
oily
and
smooth
on
which
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
season
passed
a
procession
of
motors
from
boston
and
brockton
newport
and
new
york
all
of
them
unquestionably
filled
with
people
who
would
surely
discover
that
they
were
famished
for
tea
and
preserves
and
tremendous
quantities
of
sandwiches
as
soon
as
father
and
mother
hung
out
the
sign
the
t
room
they
would
open
in
a
day
or
two
now
when
mother
had
finished
the
livid
chintz
the
was
already
crammed
with
chairs
and
tables
till
it
resembled
a
a
maid
was
established
a
cape
verde
portygee
girl
from
mashpee
all
day
long
father
had
been
copying
the
menu
upon
the
florid
cards
which
he
had
bought
from
a
bankrupt
jersey
city
printer
thick
cards
embossed
with
in
colors
which
had
quite
registered
from
their
upper
rooms
in
which
mother
had
arranged
the
furniture
to
make
the
new
home
resemble
their
new
york
flat
the
applebys
came
happily
for
the
sunset
they
were
still
excited
at
having
country
and
sea
at
their
door
still
felt
that
all
life
would
be
one
perpetual
vacation
every
day
now
they
would
have
the
wild
peace
of
the
cape
for
two
weeks
of
which
each
year
they
had
had
to
work
fifty
weeks
think
of
stepping
out
to
a
view
of
the
sea
instead
of
a
view
of
brambach
laundry
they
were
in
fact
as
glad
to
get
into
the
open
as
the
youngster
is
to
get
away
from
it
on
the
landward
side
of
the
bleak
house
roses
were
luxuriant
and
a
stiff
garden
gave
charily
of
small
marigolds
riches
were
these
by
comparison
with
the
two
geraniums
in
a
which
had
been
their
new
york
garden
but
they
had
an
even
greater
pride
the
sheltered
by
laurel
from
the
sea
winds
was
a
whitewashed
lattice
covered
with
crimson
ramblers
through
a
gap
in
the
laurels
they
could
see
the
ocean
stabbingly
blue
in
contrast
to
the
white
dunes
which
reared
battlements
along
the
top
of
the
gravel
cliff
far
out
a
coasting
schooner
blossomed
on
the
blue
skyline
bees
hummed
and
the
heart
was
quiet
already
the
applebys
had
found
the
place
of
brooding
blossoms
for
which
they
had
hoped
already
they
loved
the
as
they
had
never
loved
the
city
he
nuzzled
her
cheek
like
an
old
horse
out
at
pasture
and
old
honey
he
whispered
two
days
more
and
they
had
the
ready
for
its
opening
father
insisted
on
giving
the
evening
over
to
wild
ceremonies
he
played
juanita
and
kelly
with
the
green
necktie
and
other
suitable
chants
upon
that
stately
instrument
the
and
marched
through
the
banging
on
a
dishpan
with
the
wooden
suddenly
he
turned
into
the
first
customer
and
seating
himself
in
a
lordly
manner
with
his
legs
crossed
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
his
hands
waving
he
ordered
lettuce
sandwiches
a
tenderloin
steak
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
with
beef
gravy
and
hustle
my
order
young
woman
mother
was
usually
too
shy
for
but
this
time
she
was
stirred
to
stand
with
her
fat
akimbo
and
to
retort
get
nothing
here
young
fellow
this
is
a
place
for
ladies
and
gents
only
they
squealed
and
hugged
each
other
from
the
kitchen
door
the
portygee
maid
viewed
her
employers
with
lofty
scorn
as
father
gave
a
whole
series
of
imitations
of
the
possible
first
customer
who
as
variously
presented
might
be
jess
willard
senator
lodge
general
von
hindenburg
or
mary
pickford
at
four
next
afternoon
with
the
solemn
trembling
of
an
explorer
hoisting
the
flag
to
take
possession
of
new
territory
they
hung
out
their
sign
stepped
back
to
admire
it
as
it
swung
and
shone
against
the
crimson
ramblers
and
watched
for
the
next
it
was
coming
it
was
a
car
filled
with
women
in
blanket
coats
one
of
them
actually
waved
as
the
car
approached
the
little
couple
who
were
standing
in
the
sun
unconsciously
arm
in
arm
then
the
car
had
streaked
by
was
gone
round
the
bend
the
second
car
passed
them
and
the
third
a
long
intense
period
when
the
road
was
vacant
then
the
fourth
and
fifth
cars
almost
together
and
the
file
of
motorists
turned
from
exciting
prospects
into
just
motorists
passing
strangers
oblivious
of
the
two
old
people
under
their
hopeful
sign
while
they
were
forlornly
the
house
the
eleventh
car
suddenly
stopped
and
five
hungry
people
trooped
into
the
with
demands
for
tea
and
muffins
and
cake
the
applebys
did
have
muffins
but
they
did
have
sandwiches
and
everybody
was
happy
mother
shooed
the
maid
out
into
the
kitchen
and
herself
with
awkward
eagerness
to
get
orders
exactly
right
leaned
over
the
in
the
kitchen
father
stuffed
kindling
into
the
stove
to
bring
the
water
to
a
boil
again
and
pantingly
seized
the
and
attacked
a
loaf
as
though
he
were
going
to
do
it
a
violence
mother
entered
took
the
knife
away
from
him
and
dramatically
drove
him
out
to
cut
up
more
kindling
the
customers
were
served
while
they
ate
and
drank
and
talked
about
what
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
at
lunch
at
an
inn
they
were
unconscious
of
two
old
pairs
of
eyes
that
watched
them
from
the
kitchen
door
as
brightly
as
furtively
as
excitedly
as
two
birds
in
a
secret
thicket
the
host
paid
without
remarks
what
seemed
to
the
applebys
an
enormous
bill
a
dollar
and
sixty
cents
and
rambled
out
to
the
car
still
unknowing
that
two
happy
people
wanted
to
follow
him
with
their
blessings
this
history
is
unable
to
give
any
further
data
regarding
him
when
his
car
went
round
the
bend
he
disappeared
from
the
fortunes
of
the
applebys
and
he
was
not
to
know
how
much
blessing
he
had
scattered
i
say
perhaps
he
was
you
who
read
this
you
did
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
motoring
between
yarmouth
and
truro
may
did
you
with
five
in
the
party
car
with
one
slightly
twisted
the
season
was
not
quick
in
opening
to
the
applebys
the
time
between
and
was
crawlingly
slow
on
some
days
they
had
two
orders
some
days
none
at
all
of
an
evening
before
they
could
sink
into
the
peace
of
the
they
had
to
convince
themselves
that
they
could
really
expect
any
business
till
the
summerites
had
begun
to
take
their
vacations
there
was
a
curious
psychological
fact
it
had
always
been
father
the
brisk
who
had
comforted
the
secluded
mother
he
had
brought
back
to
the
flat
the
strenuousness
of
business
but
inactivity
was
hard
on
his
merry
heart
he
fretted
and
fussed
at
having
nothing
to
do
he
raged
at
having
to
throw
away
unused
bread
because
it
was
growing
stale
it
was
mother
who
reminded
him
that
they
could
expect
business
before
the
season
came
the
stream
of
cars
was
almost
a
solid
parade
the
portygee
maid
brought
the
news
that
there
were
summer
boarders
at
the
nickerson
and
the
applebys
when
they
were
in
grimsby
center
buying
butter
and
bread
saw
the
brigade
mobilizing
on
the
long
white
porches
of
the
old
harbor
inn
and
trade
began
there
was
no
rival
within
ten
miles
father
realized
with
a
thumping
heart
that
he
had
indeed
chosen
well
in
selecting
grimsby
head
ten
twelve
even
fifteen
orders
a
day
came
from
the
motorists
the
chronic
summerites
they
who
came
to
grimsby
center
each
year
walked
over
to
see
the
new
and
to
purchase
mother
doughnuts
on
june
the
applebys
made
a
profit
of
net
as
they
rested
in
the
at
dusk
of
that
day
father
burst
out
in
desperate
seriousness
oh
my
dear
my
dear
it
is
going
to
go
i
was
beginning
to
get
scared
i
could
have
forgiven
myself
if
i
let
you
in
for
something
that
would
have
been
a
failure
golly
i
been
realizing
that
we
would
have
been
pretty
badly
up
against
it
if
the
had
panned
out
right
i
have
wanted
to
shoot
myself
if
been
and
gone
and
led
you
into
want
old
honey
then
after
the
first
of
july
when
the
cape
cod
season
really
began
business
suddenly
fell
away
to
nothing
they
could
understand
it
in
panic
they
reduced
the
price
of
tea
to
five
cents
no
result
they
had
about
one
customer
a
day
they
had
not
looked
to
grimsby
center
for
the
cause
that
they
might
personally
attend
to
business
they
had
been
sending
the
maid
to
the
center
for
their
supplies
while
they
stuck
at
home
and
wore
out
their
hearts
in
vain
hoping
in
terrified
wonder
as
to
why
the
invisible
gods
had
thus
smitten
them
not
for
a
week
a
week
of
draining
expense
without
any
income
to
speak
of
did
they
find
out
one
july
evening
they
walked
to
grimsby
center
down
they
came
to
a
new
sign
shaped
like
a
declaring
in
a
striking
block
of
print
miss
mitchin
of
brookline
announces
the
quaintest
on
the
cape
historic
soule
mansion
grimsby
center
crumpets
and
sally
lunns
with
fresh
strawberry
jam
open
july
and
the
applebys
had
never
heard
of
crumpets
or
sally
lunns
while
the
light
turned
the
moors
to
a
wistful
lavender
the
little
old
couple
stood
in
a
hollow
of
the
road
looking
mutely
up
at
the
sign
that
mocked
them
from
its
elevation
on
a
bare
gravel
bank
beside
the
way
father
shoulders
braced
he
bit
his
lips
he
reached
out
for
hand
and
patted
it
he
led
her
on
and
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
oh
that
kind
of
wo
hurt
us
any
stuff
that
what
it
is
regular
autoists
would
rather
have
one
of
your
doughnuts
than
all
the
crumples
in
the
world
and
you
can
just
bet
your
bottom
dollar
on
that
sary
jane
he
even
chuckled
but
it
was
a
feeble
chuckle
and
he
could
find
no
other
solace
to
give
as
they
trudged
toward
grimsby
center
two
insignificant
people
hand
in
hand
dim
in
the
melancholy
light
which
made
mysterious
the
stretching
moors
presently
they
and
the
black
highroad
disappeared
only
the
sandy
casual
trails
and
tiny
pools
stood
out
in
the
twilight
yet
there
was
light
enough
for
them
to
see
the
silhouettes
of
two
more
signs
before
they
entered
grimsby
center
the
village
was
gay
comparatively
there
was
to
be
a
show
in
the
town
hall
and
the
sign
advertising
it
was
glaring
with
no
less
than
four
incandescent
lights
in
the
old
harbor
inn
the
guests
were
dancing
to
phonograph
music
after
their
early
supper
a
man
who
probably
meant
well
was
playing
long
yellowish
twilit
wails
on
a
cornet
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
girls
in
sailor
jumpers
with
vivid
v
of
warmly
tanned
flesh
or
in
sweaters
of
green
and
rose
and
violet
and
canary
yellow
wandered
down
to
the
to
the
applebys
there
would
have
been
cheer
and
excitement
in
this
mild
activity
after
their
weeks
indeed
father
suggested
we
ought
to
stay
and
see
the
movies
look
royal
snivvles
in
lure
of
the
crimson
cobra
six
reels
that
sounds
snappy
but
his
exuberance
died
in
a
sigh
a
block
down
harpoon
street
they
saw
a
sign
shaped
hung
out
from
a
great
elm
without
explanations
they
turned
toward
it
they
passed
a
mansion
of
those
proud
old
days
when
whalers
and
china
traders
and
brought
home
gold
and
blacks
cashmere
shawls
and
sweet
sandalwood
malay
oaths
and
the
jawbones
of
whales
the
applebys
could
see
by
the
electric
lights
bowered
in
the
that
a
stately
grass
walk
lined
with
madonna
lilies
and
hollyhock
and
phlox
led
to
the
white
door
above
which
hung
the
mocking
sign
the
house
was
lighted
the
windows
open
to
the
right
of
the
hall
was
the
where
among
walls
softened
with
silky
turkish
rugs
and
paintings
of
blue
dawn
amid
the
dunes
were
tables
of
china
sports
hats
and
swiss
toys
which
the
grimsby
summer
colony
meekly
bought
at
the
suggestion
of
the
sprightly
miss
mitchin
to
the
left
was
the
full
of
small
white
tables
and
the
sound
of
laughter
gosh
they
even
serve
supper
there
father
voice
complained
he
scarcely
knew
that
he
had
spoken
like
mother
he
was
picturing
their
own
small
and
the
that
lighted
it
come
do
let
stand
here
said
mother
fiercely
and
they
trailed
forlornly
past
they
were
not
so
much
envious
as
in
awe
of
miss
mitchin
it
seemed
to
belong
to
the
same
unattainable
world
as
newport
and
the
giant
new
york
hotels
the
applebys
did
know
it
but
grimsby
center
had
become
artistic
they
could
know
it
but
that
miss
mitchin
was
cashing
in
on
her
she
came
from
brookline
hence
massachusetts
brahmins
of
almost
pure
caste
could
permit
themselves
to
be
seen
at
her
but
nowadays
she
spent
her
winters
in
new
york
as
an
artistic
photographer
and
she
entertained
interior
decorators
minor
and
minus
poets
with
free
food
every
thursday
evening
it
may
be
hard
to
believe
but
in
she
was
still
calling
her
of
talent
a
it
was
really
a
saloon
with
a
literary
counter
in
return
whenever
they
could
borrow
the
price
from
commercialized
friends
the
yearners
had
her
take
their
photographs
artistically
which
meant
throwing
the
camera
out
of
focus
and
producing
masterpieces
which
were
everything
except
likenesses
when
miss
mitchin
resolved
to
come
to
grimsby
center
her
group
of
writers
who
had
protected
themselves
against
the
rude
crude
world
of
business
men
and
lawyers
by
living
together
in
chelsea
village
were
left
defenseless
they
were
in
danger
of
becoming
human
so
they
all
followed
miss
mitchin
to
grimsby
and
contentedly
went
on
writing
about
one
another
there
are
many
such
groups
with
the
same
summer
and
the
same
winter
some
of
them
drink
hard
liquor
and
play
cards
but
miss
mitchin
group
were
very
mild
in
manner
though
desperately
violent
in
theory
the
young
women
wore
spectacles
and
smocks
that
were
to
a
pleasing
shrimp
pink
the
young
men
also
wore
spectacles
but
not
smocks
not
usually
at
least
one
of
them
had
an
albanian
costume
and
a
beard
that
was
a
cross
between
the
beard
of
an
early
christian
martyr
on
a
diet
and
that
of
a
hobo
who
merely
needed
a
shave
elderly
ladies
loved
to
have
him
with
them
and
squeeze
their
elbows
all
of
the
yearners
read
their
poetry
aloud
very
superior
and
rising
in
the
inflections
it
is
probable
that
they
made
a
living
by
taking
in
one
another
literary
washing
but
they
were
ever
so
brave
about
their
financial
misfortunes
and
they
could
talk
about
the
ballet
russe
and
also
charlotte
russes
in
quite
the
nicest
way
indeed
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
them
playing
there
on
the
lawn
before
the
mitchin
mansion
talking
about
the
novels
they
were
going
to
write
and
the
revolutions
they
were
going
to
lead
had
miss
mitchin
ballet
of
hobohemians
been
tough
newspapermen
they
would
have
been
for
a
but
these
literary
were
a
spectacle
to
charm
the
languishing
eyes
of
the
spinsters
who
filled
the
old
harbor
inn
and
the
from
the
yellow
water
regions
who
were
viewing
the
marvels
of
nature
as
displayed
on
and
adjacent
to
the
ocean
practically
without
exception
these
ladies
put
vine
leaves
in
their
hair
geranium
leaves
anyway
and
galloped
to
miss
mitchin
to
drink
tea
and
discuss
freud
and
dance
the
in
a
wild
free
artistic
somewhat
unstandardized
manner
because
it
was
talked
about
and
crowded
ordinary
untutored
motorists
judged
miss
mitchin
the
best
place
to
go
and
permitted
their
wives
to
drag
them
past
the
spectacles
and
the
unprostituted
art
and
the
angular
young
ladies
in
baggy
smocks
breaking
out
in
sudden
irresponsible
imitations
of
pavlova
none
of
this
subtlety
this
and
fellowship
of
the
arts
was
evident
to
the
applebys
they
did
understand
the
problem
why
is
a
miss
mitchin
all
that
they
knew
as
they
dragged
weary
joints
down
the
road
and
back
to
the
bakery
on
main
street
was
that
miss
mitchin
caravanserai
was
intimidatingly
grand
and
very
busy
they
were
plodding
out
of
town
again
when
mother
exclaimed
why
father
you
forgot
to
get
your
cigarettes
no
i
oh
i
been
smoking
too
much
do
me
good
to
lay
off
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
farther
before
she
sighed
cigarettes
cost
much
have
hurt
you
to
got
you
get
the
very
next
time
we
in
town
or
send
katie
down
i
wo
have
you
denying
her
voice
droned
away
they
could
think
of
nothing
but
mean
economies
as
they
trudged
the
wide
and
magic
night
of
the
moors
when
they
were
home
and
the
familiar
chairs
and
tidies
blurred
their
memory
of
miss
mitchin
crushing
competition
father
again
declared
that
no
dinky
inn
could
permanently
rival
mother
doughnuts
but
he
said
it
faintly
then
and
more
faintly
on
the
days
following
for
inactivity
again
enervated
him
made
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
feel
almost
old
chapter
vi
apparently
the
applebys
customers
had
liked
the
t
room
well
enough
some
of
them
had
complimented
appleby
on
the
crispness
of
her
doughnuts
the
generousness
of
her
chicken
sandwiches
those
who
had
quarreled
about
the
thickness
of
the
bread
or
the
vagueness
of
flavor
in
the
tea
father
had
considered
insulting
and
he
had
been
perky
as
a
in
answering
them
a
good
many
must
have
been
pleased
for
on
their
trip
back
from
provincetown
they
returned
exclaimed
that
they
remembered
the
view
from
the
and
chatted
with
father
about
the
roads
and
new
york
and
fish
as
soon
as
the
first
novelty
of
miss
mitchin
was
gone
the
applebys
settled
down
to
custom
which
was
just
large
enough
to
keep
their
hopes
staggering
onward
and
just
small
enough
to
eat
away
their
capital
a
few
cents
a
day
instead
of
giving
them
a
profit
in
the
last
week
of
july
they
were
visited
by
their
daughter
lulu
lulu
the
fair
lulu
the
spectacled
lulu
the
lily
wife
of
harris
hartwig
the
druggist
of
saserkopee
new
york
lulu
had
informed
them
two
weeks
beforehand
that
they
were
to
be
honored
with
the
presence
of
herself
and
her
son
harry
and
father
and
mother
had
been
unable
to
think
of
any
excuse
strong
enough
to
keep
her
away
lulu
was
unkind
to
her
parents
rather
she
was
too
kind
she
gave
them
good
advice
and
tried
to
arrange
mother
hair
in
the
coiffures
displayed
by
edward
schuyler
deflaver
of
saserkopee
who
gave
smart
teas
at
the
woman
exchange
lulu
cheerily
told
father
how
well
he
was
withstanding
the
hand
of
time
which
made
him
feel
decrepit
and
become
profane
in
fact
though
they
took
it
for
granted
that
they
adored
their
dear
daughter
lulu
they
knew
that
they
would
not
enjoy
a
single
game
of
cribbage
nor
a
single
recital
by
signor
sethico
applebi
the
virtuoso
as
long
as
she
was
with
them
but
she
was
coming
and
mother
frantically
cleaned
everything
and
hid
her
favorite
old
shoes
lulu
hartwig
arrived
with
a
two
new
gowns
a
camera
and
harry
she
seemed
disappointed
not
to
find
a
large
summer
hotel
with
dancing
and
golf
next
door
to
the
t
room
and
she
did
hesitate
to
say
that
her
parents
would
have
done
better
which
meant
that
lulu
would
have
enjoyed
her
visit
more
if
they
had
located
at
bar
harbor
or
newport
she
rearranged
the
furniture
but
as
there
was
nothing
in
the
but
chairs
tables
and
a
fireplace
there
was
much
she
could
do
she
descended
on
grimsby
center
and
came
back
enthusiastic
about
miss
mitchin
she
had
met
the
young
man
with
the
albanian
costume
and
he
had
talked
to
her
about
vorticism
and
this
jolly
new
polish
composer
with
his
suite
for
and
cymbals
she
led
father
into
the
arbor
and
effervescently
demanded
why
do
mother
and
you
have
a
place
like
that
dear
old
mansion
of
miss
mitchin
and
all
those
clever
people
there
and
all
father
fairly
snarled
now
look
here
young
woman
the
less
you
say
about
miss
mitten
the
more
popular
you
be
around
here
and
do
you
dare
to
speak
to
your
mother
about
that
place
it
raised
the
devil
with
our
trade
and
i
wo
have
your
mother
bothered
with
it
and
if
you
mean
the
young
fellow
that
needs
a
decent
pair
of
pantaloons
by
this
costume
business
why
i
sh
think
you
be
ashamed
to
speak
of
him
now
father
of
course
you
have
particularly
studied
artists
look
here
young
woman
when
you
used
to
visit
us
in
new
york
it
was
all
right
for
you
to
get
our
goats
by
sticking
your
snub
nose
in
the
air
and
asking
us
if
we
read
a
lot
of
books
that
we
never
heard
of
i
admit
that
was
a
good
way
to
show
us
how
superior
you
were
but
this
miss
mitten
place
is
a
pretty
serious
proposition
for
us
to
buck
and
i
absolutely
forbid
you
to
bother
your
mother
with
mentioning
it
father
stood
straight
and
glared
at
her
there
was
in
him
nothing
of
the
weary
little
man
who
was
in
awe
of
miss
mitchin
even
his
daughter
was
impressed
she
forgot
for
a
moment
that
she
was
hartwig
now
and
had
the
best
phonograph
in
saserkopee
but
she
took
one
more
shot
all
the
same
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
if
you
had
some
clever
people
or
some
society
people
coming
here
often
it
would
advertise
the
place
as
nothing
else
would
well
we
see
about
that
said
father
which
meant
of
course
that
he
would
see
about
it
lulu
hartwig
was
a
source
of
agitation
for
two
weeks
after
outbreak
she
stopped
commenting
but
every
day
when
business
was
light
they
could
feel
her
accusingly
counting
the
number
of
customers
but
she
did
not
become
active
again
till
the
sunday
before
her
going
the
applebys
were
sitting
that
day
holding
hands
and
avoiding
lulu
below
them
they
heard
a
stop
and
mother
prepared
to
go
down
and
serve
the
tourists
the
brazen
beloved
voice
of
uncle
joe
tubbs
of
west
skipsit
blared
out
where
the
folks
heh
tell
the
tubbses
are
here
and
lulu
congealed
voice
in
answer
i
do
know
whether
they
are
at
home
if
they
are
who
shall
i
tell
them
is
calling
please
huh
oh
well
just
say
the
tubbses
and
mrs
tubbs
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
by
this
time
father
and
mother
were
galloping
they
welcomed
the
tubbses
with
yelps
of
pleasure
the
four
of
them
sat
in
rockers
on
the
grass
and
talked
about
the
tubbses
boarders
and
the
applebys
admired
to
hear
that
uncle
joe
now
ran
the
car
himself
but
all
of
them
were
conscious
that
lulu
in
a
chiffon
scarf
and
was
watching
them
amusedly
and
the
tubbses
uneasily
took
leave
in
an
hour
pleading
the
distance
back
to
west
skipsit
not
till
evening
when
he
got
the
chance
to
walk
by
himself
on
the
beach
below
the
gravel
cliffs
did
father
quite
realize
what
his
daughter
had
done
that
with
her
superior
manner
she
had
frightened
the
tubbses
away
yet
there
was
nothing
to
do
about
it
even
at
her
departure
there
was
a
certain
difficulty
for
lulu
developed
a
resolution
to
have
her
parents
visit
her
at
saserkopee
perhaps
she
wished
to
show
them
in
what
state
she
now
lived
or
it
may
conceivably
be
that
in
her
refined
and
determined
manner
she
was
fond
of
her
parents
she
kissed
them
repeatedly
and
was
gone
with
much
waving
of
a
handkerchief
and
yelps
of
now
do
forget
you
you
to
visit
me
be
sure
and
write
harry
do
stick
your
head
out
of
the
window
lulu
visit
had
two
effects
upon
the
lives
of
father
and
mother
they
found
that
their
quiet
love
had
grown
stronger
sweeter
in
the
two
weeks
it
had
been
denied
the
silly
fondnesses
of
utterance
they
could
laugh
now
that
there
was
no
critic
of
their
shy
brand
of
humor
father
stopped
on
the
step
and
winked
an
immense
shameless
wink
at
mother
and
she
sighed
and
said
with
unexpected
understanding
yes
i
afraid
lulu
is
a
little
just
a
bit
and
i
reckon
we
wo
be
in
such
a
hustle
to
visit
her
mother
was
so
vulgar
as
to
grunt
well
i
guess
not
that
evening
they
sat
in
the
again
and
had
tone
poems
on
the
and
dreamed
that
something
would
happen
to
make
their
investment
pay
another
result
there
was
of
lulu
visit
father
could
help
remembering
her
suggestion
that
they
ought
to
bag
a
social
or
artistic
lion
as
an
attraction
for
the
t
room
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
after
weeks
of
vacuous
worry
he
had
another
idea
now
that
august
the
height
of
the
season
had
come
he
would
capture
vance
carter
herself
vance
carter
was
the
widow
of
the
boothbay
textile
mills
millions
she
was
a
winslow
on
her
father
side
a
cabot
on
her
mother
and
beacon
street
was
officially
swept
from
end
to
end
and
tidied
with
little
pink
feather
dusters
whenever
she
returned
to
boston
she
was
so
solid
that
society
reporters
did
dare
write
little
items
about
her
and
when
she
was
in
charleston
she
was
invited
to
the
saint
cecilia
ball
also
she
was
rather
ignorant
rather
unhappy
and
completely
aimless
she
and
her
daughter
spent
their
summers
three
miles
from
grimsby
head
in
an
estate
with
a
and
a
conservatory
and
a
golf
course
and
a
house
with
three
towers
and
other
architecture
when
america
becomes
a
military
autocracy
she
will
be
lady
carter
or
the
countess
of
grimsby
the
applebys
saw
her
go
by
every
day
in
a
landaulet
with
liveried
chauffeur
and
footman
with
breathless
secrecy
father
planned
to
entice
vance
carter
to
the
t
room
once
they
had
her
there
she
would
certainly
appreciate
the
wholesome
goodness
of
mother
cooking
he
imagined
long
intimate
conversations
in
which
carter
would
say
to
him
appleby
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
like
to
get
away
from
my
french
cook
and
enjoy
your
nice
old
house
and
appleby
delicious
homey
doughnuts
it
was
easy
to
win
carter
in
imagination
sitting
by
himself
in
the
while
mother
served
their
infrequent
customers
or
stood
at
the
door
unhappily
watching
for
them
father
visualized
carter
exclaiming
over
the
view
from
the
arbor
the
sunset
across
the
moors
as
seen
from
their
door
which
was
father
believed
absolutely
the
largest
and
finest
sunset
in
the
world
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
discover
in
vance
carter
a
sneaking
fondness
for
cribbage
which
in
her
exalted
social
position
she
had
had
to
conceal
he
saw
her
send
the
chauffeur
away
and
cache
her
lorgnette
and
roll
up
her
sleeves
and
simply
wade
into
an
orgy
of
cribbage
with
pleasing
light
refreshments
of
cider
and
cakes
waiting
by
the
fireplace
then
he
saw
carter
sending
all
her
acquaintances
to
the
t
room
and
the
establishment
so
prosperous
that
miss
mitchin
would
come
around
and
beg
the
applebys
to
enter
into
partnership
father
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
believe
all
his
fancies
but
had
he
heard
the
most
surprising
tales
of
how
friendly
these
great
folk
could
be
why
here
just
the
other
day
he
had
been
reading
in
the
innards
of
the
how
jim
hill
the
railroad
king
had
dropped
off
at
a
little
station
in
north
dakota
one
night
and
talked
for
hours
to
the
young
he
was
burning
to
do
something
besides
helping
mother
in
the
kitchen
something
which
would
save
them
and
pull
the
out
of
the
hole
without
a
word
to
mother
he
started
for
grimsby
hill
the
estate
of
vance
carter
he
did
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
he
was
certain
that
he
was
going
to
do
something
as
he
arrived
at
the
long
line
of
iron
picket
fence
surrounding
grimsby
hill
he
saw
carter
motor
enter
the
gate
it
seemed
to
be
a
good
omen
he
hurried
to
the
gate
peered
in
then
passed
on
he
could
go
and
swagger
past
that
and
intrude
on
that
sweep
of
private
driveway
he
walked
shyly
along
the
iron
fence
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
he
got
up
courage
to
go
back
rush
through
the
towering
iron
gateway
and
past
the
into
the
sacred
estate
he
expected
to
hear
a
voice
it
would
be
a
cockney
servant
voice
demanding
you
wot
do
you
want
but
no
one
stopped
him
no
one
spoke
to
him
he
was
safe
among
the
rhododendrons
he
clumped
along
as
though
he
had
important
business
secretly
patting
his
tie
into
shape
and
smoothing
his
hair
just
let
anybody
try
to
stop
him
he
knew
what
he
was
about
but
he
really
did
know
what
he
was
about
he
had
the
slightest
notion
as
to
whether
he
would
go
up
and
invite
their
dear
carter
to
come
and
see
them
or
tack
up
a
t
room
advertisement
on
the
porch
he
came
to
a
stretch
of
lawn
with
the
house
and
all
its
three
towers
scowling
down
at
him
behind
it
were
the
edges
of
a
group
of
he
veered
around
toward
these
outside
the
garage
he
saw
the
chauffeur
with
his
livery
coat
off
polishing
a
fender
great
perhaps
he
could
persuade
the
chauffeur
to
help
him
he
put
on
what
he
felt
to
be
a
new
york
briskness
furtively
touched
his
tie
again
and
skipped
up
to
the
chauffeur
fine
day
he
said
breezily
starting
with
the
one
neutral
topic
of
conversation
in
the
world
what
of
it
said
the
chauffeur
and
went
on
polishing
well
uh
say
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
you
i
guess
there
nothing
stopping
you
and
have
your
talk
i
get
away
the
old
dragon
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
me
too
this
morning
so
did
the
housekeeper
everybody
does
and
he
polished
harder
than
ever
ha
ha
which
indicates
father
laughter
though
actually
it
sounded
more
like
hick
hick
as
carelessly
as
he
could
father
observed
that
how
it
goes
all
right
i
know
when
i
was
in
the
shoe
business
waal
waal
you
do
say
so
si
haow
the
shoe
business
in
hyannis
papa
hyannis
hell
i
been
in
business
in
new
york
city
new
york
for
more
than
forty
years
oh
father
felt
that
he
had
made
an
impression
he
stuck
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
as
he
had
not
done
these
six
gloomy
weeks
threw
out
his
chest
and
tried
to
look
like
and
broadway
with
a
dash
of
wall
street
and
a
flavor
of
fifth
avenue
the
chauffeur
sighed
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
any
guy
that
lived
in
new
york
that
long
and
then
comes
to
this
neck
of
land
is
a
nut
with
an
almost
cosmic
sorrow
in
his
manner
and
an
irritated
twist
in
his
suspenders
the
chauffeur
disappeared
into
the
garage
father
forlornly
felt
that
he
was
visibly
getting
nearer
to
the
heart
and
patronage
of
vance
carter
he
stood
alone
on
the
cement
terrace
before
the
garage
the
square
grim
back
of
the
big
house
did
so
much
look
down
on
him
as
beautifully
ignore
him
a
maid
in
a
cap
peeped
wonderingly
at
him
from
a
window
a
man
in
dun
livery
wheeled
a
vacuum
cleaner
out
of
an
unexpected
basement
door
an
appearing
at
the
corner
dragging
a
cultivator
stared
at
him
far
off
somewhere
he
heard
a
voice
crying
fif
love
he
could
see
a
corner
of
a
sunken
garden
with
stiff
borders
of
box
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
a
whole
army
of
unexpected
servants
stood
between
him
and
vance
carter
that
at
any
moment
a
fat
expensive
butler
like
the
butlers
you
see
in
the
movies
would
pop
up
and
order
him
off
the
grounds
the
unsatisfactory
chauffeur
reappeared
in
a
panic
father
urged
say
my
name
appleby
and
i
run
the
at
grimsby
head
you
know
couple
of
miles
this
side
of
the
center
it
would
be
pretty
nice
for
our
class
of
business
if
the
madam
was
to
stop
there
some
time
and
i
was
just
wondering
just
kinda
wondering
if
some
time
when
she
felt
thirsty
you
c
she
do
never
tell
me
when
she
thirsty
she
just
tells
me
when
she
mad
well
you
know
some
time
you
might
be
stopping
to
show
her
the
view
or
something
you
fix
it
up
and
here
you
get
yourself
some
cigars
he
timidly
held
out
a
bill
it
seemed
to
bore
the
chauffeur
a
good
deal
but
he
condescended
to
take
it
father
tried
to
look
knowing
and
friendly
and
sophisticated
all
at
once
he
added
any
time
you
feel
like
a
good
cup
o
tea
and
the
finest
doughnuts
you
ever
ate
why
you
just
drop
in
yourself
and
cost
you
a
cent
all
right
i
see
what
i
can
do
said
the
chauffeur
and
vanished
again
father
airily
stamped
along
the
driveway
his
head
was
high
and
hopeful
he
inspected
the
as
though
he
were
maurice
mcloughlin
he
admitted
that
the
rhododendrons
were
quite
extensive
in
fact
he
liked
grimsby
hill
he
had
saved
their
fortunes
not
for
himself
but
for
mother
he
whistled
the
rag
all
the
way
home
interrupting
himself
only
to
murmur
i
wonder
where
the
back
door
of
that
house
is
not
at
the
back
anyway
never
saw
even
a
and
then
for
two
weeks
he
sat
with
mother
in
the
sun
and
watched
the
motors
go
by
they
were
almost
ready
to
admit
now
that
their
venture
was
a
complete
failure
that
they
were
ruined
that
they
did
know
what
they
would
do
with
no
savings
and
a
rainy
day
coming
they
let
their
maid
go
they
gave
the
grocer
smaller
and
smaller
orders
for
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
and
even
these
orders
were
invariably
too
large
for
the
little
custom
that
came
their
way
for
a
week
father
concealed
the
fact
that
vance
carter
would
be
coming
not
now
but
very
soon
then
he
had
to
tell
mother
the
secret
to
save
her
from
prostrating
worry
they
talked
always
of
that
coming
miracle
as
they
sat
with
hand
desperately
clutching
hand
in
the
evening
they
nearly
convinced
themselves
that
carter
would
send
her
friends
september
was
almost
here
and
it
was
too
late
for
carter
influence
to
help
them
this
year
but
they
trusted
that
somehow
by
the
magic
of
her
wealth
and
position
she
would
enable
them
to
get
through
the
winter
and
find
success
during
the
next
year
they
developed
a
remarkable
skill
in
seeing
her
car
coming
far
down
the
road
when
either
of
them
saw
it
the
other
was
summoned
and
they
waited
tremblingly
but
the
landaulet
always
passed
with
carter
staring
straight
ahead
and
sometimes
with
miss
margaret
carter
whose
softly
piquant
little
nose
would
in
time
be
hooked
like
her
mother
father
treacherous
ally
the
chauffeur
never
even
looked
at
the
t
room
sometimes
father
wondered
if
the
chauffeur
knew
just
where
the
house
was
perhaps
he
had
never
noticed
it
he
planned
to
wave
and
attract
the
chauffeur
attention
but
in
face
of
the
prodigious
carter
he
never
dared
to
carry
out
the
plan
september
the
applebys
had
given
up
hope
of
miracles
they
were
making
up
their
minds
to
notify
pilkings
of
pilkings
son
sixth
avenue
standard
shoe
parlor
that
father
again
wanted
the
job
he
had
held
for
so
many
years
they
must
leave
the
for
the
noise
of
that
most
alien
of
places
their
native
new
york
mother
was
in
the
kitchen
father
at
the
front
door
aimlessly
whittling
he
looked
up
saw
the
vance
carter
motor
approach
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
growled
let
her
go
to
the
dickens
then
the
car
had
stopped
and
vance
carter
and
miss
margaret
carter
had
incredibly
stepped
out
had
started
up
the
path
to
the
chapter
vii
father
hand
kept
on
aimlessly
whittling
while
his
eyes
poked
out
like
those
of
a
harassed
when
he
saw
vance
carter
actually
stop
it
was
surely
a
dream
in
his
worry
over
inactivity
he
had
found
himself
falling
into
queer
little
illusions
lately
he
was
conscious
that
the
chauffeur
whom
he
had
bribed
to
stop
some
day
was
winking
at
him
in
a
vulgar
manner
not
at
all
appropriate
to
his
uniform
he
had
a
spasm
of
indignant
wonder
i
bet
a
hat
that
fellow
have
a
thing
to
do
with
this
he
a
grafter
then
he
sprang
up
bowing
carter
rustled
up
to
him
and
murmured
may
we
have
some
tea
here
and
a
cake
do
you
know
oh
yes
wo
you
step
right
in
fine
day
carter
seemed
not
to
have
any
opinions
regarding
the
day
quite
right
too
it
was
an
especially
fine
day
just
she
marched
in
gave
one
quick
nervous
look
and
said
with
tremendous
politeness
may
we
have
this
table
by
the
window
you
have
such
a
charming
view
over
the
cliffs
oh
yes
we
hoped
some
day
you
take
that
table
kind
of
kept
the
view
for
you
said
father
with
panting
gallantry
fairly
falling
over
himself
as
he
rushed
across
the
floor
to
pull
out
their
chairs
and
straighten
the
carter
paid
no
attention
to
him
whatsoever
she
drew
a
from
her
small
and
set
upon
her
beetling
nose
a
huge
pair
of
she
picked
up
the
as
though
she
were
delicately
removing
a
bug
supposing
there
to
be
any
bug
so
presumptuous
as
to
crawl
upon
her
smart
tan
suit
she
raised
her
chin
and
held
the
card
high
uh
tea
lettuce
sandwiches
sandwiches
chicken
sandwiches
doughnuts
cinnamon
toast
she
read
off
to
her
daughter
so
quickly
that
he
started
she
turned
on
father
and
demanded
what
sort
of
tea
have
you
please
why
uh
just
a
minute
and
i
ask
father
bolted
through
the
door
into
the
large
clean
woodeny
kitchen
where
mother
was
wearily
taking
a
batch
of
doughnuts
out
of
the
mother
he
exulted
carter
she
here
mother
dropped
the
doughnuts
back
into
the
kettle
the
splashing
fat
must
have
burnt
her
but
beyond
mutely
wiping
the
grease
from
her
hand
she
paid
no
attention
to
it
she
turned
paper
white
oh
seth
she
groaned
then
in
agony
after
your
going
and
getting
them
here
i
have
a
thing
ready
for
them
but
lettuce
sandwiches
and
fresh
doughnuts
never
mind
i
make
them
take
those
say
what
kind
of
tea
have
we
got
now
oh
dear
we
have
got
a
thing
left
but
just
well
it
just
tea
mixed
he
galloped
back
into
the
frightened
lest
the
royal
patrons
leave
before
they
were
served
on
the
way
he
resolved
to
lie
not
as
the
pinching
tradesman
lies
smugly
and
unconsciously
but
desperately
to
save
mother
we
have
orange
pekoe
and
oolong
he
gasped
then
you
might
give
us
some
orange
pekoe
and
oh
two
chicken
sandwiches
gee
i
awfully
sorry
but
we
just
out
of
chicken
sandwiches
if
we
only
known
were
coming
but
we
have
some
very
nice
fresh
lettuce
sandwiches
and
i
do
wish
you
would
try
some
of
our
doughnuts
they
just
this
minute
he
clasped
his
hands
pressed
them
till
the
fingers
of
one
gouged
the
back
of
the
other
father
was
not
a
uriah
heep
at
pilkings
son
he
had
often
talked
back
to
some
of
his
best
customers
but
now
he
would
gladly
have
licked
vance
carter
spatted
shoes
no
oh
bring
us
some
lettuce
sandwiches
and
some
orange
pekoe
i
think
we
care
for
any
doughnuts
said
carter
impatiently
father
bolted
again
and
whispered
to
mother
who
stood
where
he
had
left
her
lettuce
sandwiches
and
tea
and
for
heaven
sake
make
the
tea
taste
as
much
like
orange
pekoe
as
you
can
the
applebys
had
no
delicately
adjusted
rule
about
the
thickness
of
bread
in
sandwiches
sometimes
mother
was
moved
to
make
them
very
dainty
very
thin
and
trim
but
now
because
he
was
in
such
a
fever
to
please
the
carters
father
fairly
slashed
their
last
loaf
of
bread
and
slapped
in
the
lettuce
while
mother
was
drawing
tea
in
two
minutes
he
was
proudly
entering
with
the
he
set
it
down
before
the
carters
he
fussed
with
a
crumb
on
the
with
the
rather
faded
crimson
rambler
in
the
ornate
vase
carter
glanced
at
him
impatiently
he
realized
that
he
was
being
officious
and
rushed
away
mother
was
sitting
by
the
wide
kitchen
table
which
was
scarred
with
generations
of
use
of
cleaver
and
and
the
kitchen
door
was
open
to
the
broad
land
which
flowed
up
to
the
sill
in
a
pleasant
sea
of
waving
grass
but
she
was
turned
from
it
staring
apprehensively
toward
the
round
her
swirled
the
heat
from
the
stove
and
restless
flies
lighted
on
her
cheek
and
flew
off
at
hectic
tangents
father
tiptoed
up
to
her
smiling
i
left
the
door
open
wide
enough
so
you
can
see
them
he
whispered
come
and
take
a
look
at
them
vance
carter
gee
and
her
daughter
a
mighty
pretty
girl
not
that
i
think
much
of
these
blouses
that
are
cut
so
low
and
all
oh
i
would
dare
mother
stopped
short
quiet
as
they
were
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
voices
from
the
other
room
the
carter
girl
she
who
was
known
as
pig
carter
at
miss
school
was
snapping
what
in
the
world
ever
made
you
come
to
this
frightful
hole
mama
simply
because
i
wanted
to
stop
some
place
and
i
really
ca
stand
that
mincing
miss
mitchin
and
her
yearners
and
that
odious
creature
with
the
beard
and
the
ballet
skirt
again
at
least
mitchin
shop
is
better
than
this
awful
place
why
this
might
be
one
of
those
railroad
you
see
from
a
train
i
not
so
sure
this
really
is
worse
than
the
mitchin
creature
zoo
marky
at
least
this
is
a
perfect
study
in
what
not
to
do
i
fancy
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
every
interior
decorator
to
come
here
and
learn
what
to
avoid
and
you
know
they
really
might
have
done
something
with
this
place
rather
a
decent
old
house
with
a
good
plain
fireplace
but
then
any
one
could
make
a
charming
room
and
only
a
genius
could
have
imagined
this
combination
an
oak
chair
with
a
wicker
table
and
a
cotton
i
sure
that
exhibition
of
bad
taste
was
it
i
do
pore
over
the
newspapers
as
you
do
that
they
held
in
new
york
would
have
been
charmed
to
secure
that
picture
of
the
kittens
and
the
infant
all
this
conveyed
in
the
carters
clear
voices
father
and
mother
heard
perfectly
the
picture
of
kittens
and
a
baby
they
had
bought
just
after
lulu
birth
and
it
had
always
hung
above
the
couch
in
their
in
new
york
margaret
carter
was
continuing
i
do
mind
the
bad
taste
a
bit
but
i
was
hungry
after
motoring
all
day
almost
and
i
did
want
a
decent
tea
if
you
could
see
that
horrid
victorian
at
miss
you
could
stand
even
sticky
kitties
in
a
picture
i
do
care
about
the
interior
decoration
as
long
as
marky
little
interior
gets
decorated
decently
but
this
tea
is
simply
terrible
orange
pekoe
why
even
miss
severance
horrid
ceylon
is
better
than
this
and
she
does
give
you
cream
instead
of
this
milk
of
magnesia
or
soapy
water
or
whatever
the
beastly
stuff
is
and
to
have
to
drink
it
out
of
these
horrid
thick
cups
like
toothbrush
mugs
i
sure
i
find
a
old
toothbrush
when
i
get
to
the
bottom
do
be
vulgar
marky
you
might
remember
this
is
massachusetts
not
new
york
well
this
massachusetts
lettuce
i
perfectly
convinced
that
they
used
it
for
before
they
went
and
lost
it
in
the
sandwiches
and
this
thick
crumby
bread
oh
it
unspeakable
i
do
wish
you
would
poke
around
in
these
horrid
places
mama
or
else
leave
me
in
the
car
when
you
are
moved
to
go
slumming
i
sure
i
do
feel
any
call
to
uplift
the
poor
my
dear
child
i
seem
to
remember
your
admiring
freddy
dabney
because
he
is
so
heroically
poor
it
very
good
for
you
to
come
to
a
place
like
this
now
you
know
what
it
like
to
be
poor
marky
you
can
see
precisely
how
romantic
it
really
is
oh
i
admit
marky
is
a
perfect
little
devil
but
i
do
want
you
to
observe
that
she
been
brave
enough
to
eat
part
of
her
sandwich
go
where
is
the
nice
smiling
little
man
let
pay
our
bill
and
go
twenty
feet
from
the
bored
carters
was
tragedy
dumb
father
stood
by
mother
chair
stroking
her
dull
hair
as
she
laid
her
head
on
the
crude
kitchen
table
and
sobbed
mechanically
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
his
hand
passed
over
her
dear
comfortable
head
while
he
listened
even
as
on
the
stairs
to
the
guillotine
a
gallant
gentleman
of
old
france
might
have
caressed
his
marquise
mother
he
began
it
was
hard
to
say
anything
when
there
was
nothing
to
say
it
all
right
they
just
silly
snobs
they
yes
the
applebys
could
not
understand
every
detail
of
what
the
carters
had
said
interior
decoration
that
did
mean
anything
to
them
all
that
they
understood
was
that
they
were
fools
and
failures
in
the
beginning
of
their
old
age
that
they
belonged
to
the
quite
ludicrously
inefficient
father
realized
presently
that
the
carters
were
waiting
for
their
bill
for
a
minute
more
he
stroked
mother
hair
if
the
carters
would
only
go
from
this
place
they
had
desecrated
and
take
their
damned
money
with
them
but
he
had
been
trained
by
years
of
dealing
with
people
in
a
at
least
to
make
an
effort
to
conceal
his
feelings
he
dragged
himself
into
the
kept
himself
waiting
with
expressionless
face
till
carter
murmured
the
bill
please
tonelessly
he
said
thirty
cents
carter
took
out
not
three
but
four
dimes
four
nice
shiny
new
dimes
she
sometimes
said
at
her
bank
that
really
she
could
touch
soiled
money
she
dropped
them
on
the
and
went
modestly
on
her
way
an
honorable
clever
rather
kindly
and
unhappy
woman
who
had
just
committed
murder
father
picked
up
the
tip
with
loathing
he
threw
it
in
the
fireplace
then
went
knelt
down
and
picked
it
out
again
mother
would
need
all
the
money
he
could
get
for
her
in
the
coming
wintry
days
of
failure
failure
he
himself
had
brought
upon
her
chapter
viii
having
once
admitted
hopelessness
it
was
humanly
natural
that
they
should
again
hope
that
they
hoped
for
perhaps
two
weeks
after
the
carters
visit
they
pretended
that
the
was
open
and
they
did
have
six
or
seven
customers
but
late
in
september
father
got
his
courage
up
took
out
the
family
pen
and
bottle
of
ink
the
tablet
of
ruled
stationery
and
a
and
wrote
to
pilkings
that
he
wanted
his
job
back
when
he
had
mailed
the
letter
he
told
mother
she
sighed
and
said
yes
that
is
better
after
all
an
indian
summer
of
happiness
came
over
them
they
were
going
back
to
security
again
father
played
the
a
little
and
they
talked
of
the
familiar
city
places
they
would
see
they
would
enjoy
the
movies
weeks
since
they
had
seen
a
movie
and
they
would
have
father
chucklingly
declared
a
dinner
at
bomberghof
terrace
with
music
and
yes
by
jiminy
and
cocktails
for
a
week
he
awaited
an
answer
waited
anxiously
though
he
kept
reassuring
himself
that
old
pilkings
had
promised
to
keep
the
job
open
for
him
he
received
a
reply
but
it
was
from
pilkings
son
it
informed
him
that
pilkings
was
rather
ill
with
grippe
and
that
until
he
recovered
no
action
can
be
taken
regarding
your
valued
proposition
in
letter
of
recent
date
bewildered
incredulous
father
had
a
flash
of
understanding
that
he
who
felt
himself
so
young
and
fit
was
already
discarded
mother
sat
across
the
kitchen
table
from
him
pretending
to
read
the
but
really
watching
him
he
held
his
forehead
looked
dizzy
and
let
the
letter
slip
from
his
fingers
i
uh
he
groaned
i
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
around
the
house
tell
me
what
did
the
letter
say
oh
mother
mother
maybe
i
wo
get
my
job
back
at
all
i
honestly
do
know
what
we
can
do
running
to
her
he
hid
his
face
in
her
lap
he
the
head
of
the
family
the
imperturbable
adventurer
changed
to
a
child
and
mother
she
who
had
always
looked
to
him
for
inspiration
was
indeed
the
mother
now
she
stroked
his
cheek
she
cried
never
mind
you
get
it
back
or
a
better
one
she
made
fun
of
his
tousled
hair
till
she
had
him
ruefully
smiling
her
voice
had
a
crisp
briskness
which
it
had
lacked
in
the
days
when
she
had
brooded
in
the
flat
and
waited
for
her
man
father
could
not
face
another
indefinite
period
of
such
inactivity
as
had
been
sapping
him
all
summer
he
longed
for
the
dusty
drudgery
of
pilkings
son
longed
to
be
busy
all
day
and
to
bring
home
news
and
money
to
mother
at
night
aside
from
his
personal
desires
what
were
they
going
to
do
they
had
left
in
actual
money
less
than
fifty
dollars
father
did
not
become
querulous
but
day
by
day
he
became
more
dependent
on
mother
cheer
as
october
opened
as
chilly
rains
began
to
shut
them
in
the
house
when
she
was
not
busy
and
he
was
not
cutting
wood
or
forlornly
pecking
away
at
useless
cleanings
of
the
cold
and
empty
they
talked
of
what
they
would
do
father
had
wild
plans
of
dashing
down
to
new
york
of
seeing
young
pilkings
of
getting
work
in
some
other
but
he
knew
very
little
about
other
stores
he
was
not
so
much
a
as
a
pilkings
clerk
it
had
been
as
important
a
part
of
his
duties
these
many
years
to
know
what
to
say
to
pilkings
as
to
know
what
to
show
to
customers
surely
when
pilkings
senior
was
well
he
would
remember
his
offer
to
keep
the
job
open
mother
cautiously
began
to
suggest
her
plan
she
spoke
fondly
of
their
daughter
lulu
of
their
grandson
harry
of
how
estimable
and
upright
a
citizen
was
their
harris
hartwig
of
saserkopee
new
york
as
father
knew
none
of
these
suggestions
to
have
any
factual
basis
whatever
his
clear
little
mind
was
bored
by
them
then
after
a
stormy
evening
when
the
fire
was
warm
and
they
had
cheered
up
enough
to
play
cribbage
mother
suddenly
plumped
out
her
plan
to
go
to
saserkopee
and
live
with
daughter
till
something
turned
up
father
shrank
he
crouched
in
his
chair
a
wizened
frightened
unhappy
oldish
man
no
no
no
no
he
cried
she
is
a
good
girl
but
she
would
badger
us
to
death
she
would
let
us
do
one
single
thing
our
way
she
always
acts
as
though
she
wanted
to
make
you
all
over
and
i
love
you
the
way
you
are
i
rather
get
a
job
cooking
on
a
fishing
schooner
than
do
that
but
he
knew
mother
way
of
sticking
to
an
idea
and
he
began
to
persuade
himself
that
saserkopee
was
a
haven
of
refuge
whenever
they
seemed
to
be
having
a
peaceful
discussion
of
lulu
sweater
they
were
hearing
her
voice
wondering
if
they
could
tolerate
its
twangy
comments
the
rest
of
their
lives
if
the
weather
was
clear
they
sat
out
in
the
as
though
they
were
soon
to
lose
it
the
roses
were
dead
now
but
a
bank
of
purple
asters
glowed
by
the
and
in
the
garden
plucky
pansies
withstood
the
chill
they
tried
to
keep
up
a
pretense
of
happiness
but
always
they
were
listening
listening
there
were
two
or
three
october
days
when
the
sea
was
blue
and
silver
sharply
and
brightly
outlined
against
the
far
skyline
where
the
deep
blue
heavens
modulated
to
a
filmy
turquoise
gulls
followed
the
furrows
of
the
breakers
father
and
mother
paced
the
edge
of
the
cliff
or
sat
in
the
beloved
arbor
then
a
day
of
iron
sea
cruelly
on
one
side
and
sullenly
black
on
the
other
with
broken
rolling
clouds
and
sand
whisking
along
the
dunes
in
shallow
eddies
rain
coming
and
the
breakers
pounding
in
with
a
terrifying
roar
and
the
menace
of
illimitable
power
father
gathered
piles
of
for
the
fire
whistling
as
he
hacked
at
them
with
a
dull
hatchet
trimming
them
not
because
it
was
necessary
but
because
it
gave
him
something
energetic
to
do
whenever
he
came
into
the
kitchen
with
an
armful
of
them
he
found
mother
standing
at
the
window
anxiously
watching
the
flurries
of
sand
and
rain
be
a
fine
night
to
sit
by
the
fire
he
chirruped
guess
we
get
out
the
old
and
have
a
little
admission
five
bucks
eh
something
of
the
old
command
was
in
his
voice
mother
actually
needed
his
comfort
against
the
black
hours
of
storm
though
they
used
a
very
prosaic
stove
for
cooking
the
old
fireplace
still
filled
half
the
back
of
the
kitchen
and
this
had
become
the
center
of
their
house
neither
of
them
could
abide
the
echoing
emptiness
and
shabby
grandeur
of
the
before
the
fireplace
they
sat
after
a
supper
at
which
father
had
made
much
of
enjoying
fish
chowder
though
they
had
had
it
four
times
in
eight
days
cheaper
and
very
nourishing
the
shutters
banged
sand
crashed
against
the
panes
rain
leaked
in
a
steady
drip
down
one
corner
of
the
room
and
the
sea
smashed
unceasingly
but
father
played
my
gal
a
lady
and
any
little
girl
that
a
nice
little
girl
is
the
right
little
girl
for
me
and
other
silly
cheerful
melodies
which
even
the
had
forgotten
there
was
a
sense
of
glaring
mounting
light
through
the
window
which
gave
on
the
cliff
i
wonder
what
that
is
mother
shuddered
it
like
a
big
fire
i
declare
it
seems
as
though
the
whole
world
was
coming
to
an
end
she
turned
from
the
window
and
shivered
over
the
embers
in
her
rocker
which
father
had
filled
with
cushions
he
kissed
her
boyishly
and
trotted
over
to
the
window
the
fact
that
they
were
alone
against
the
elements
with
no
full
of
people
to
share
the
tumultuous
night
weakened
her
but
delighted
him
he
cried
out
with
a
feeling
of
dramatic
joy
there
was
a
fire
below
on
the
beach
where
there
should
be
nothing
but
sand
and
the
terror
of
the
storm
the
outer
edge
of
the
cliff
was
outlined
by
the
light
it
a
wreck
he
whooped
it
the
mother
i
going
down
maybe
there
something
i
can
do
i
want
to
do
something
again
maybe
some
poor
devil
coming
ashore
in
the
breeches
buoy
help
him
ashore
do
suppose
i
could
row
he
darted
at
the
closet
and
yanked
out
his
ineffectual
city
raincoat
and
rubbers
and
the
dreary
wreck
of
what
had
once
been
his
pert
new
vacation
no
no
do
please
do
mother
begged
you
could
do
anything
and
i
do
dast
to
go
out
and
i
afraid
to
stay
here
alone
but
father
was
putting
on
his
raincoat
i
just
run
down
and
see
be
right
back
do
go
a
step
farther
than
the
top
of
the
cliff
she
wailed
he
hesitated
he
wanted
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
to
be
in
the
midst
of
heroic
effort
the
gods
had
set
the
stage
for
epic
action
that
night
and
his
spirit
was
big
with
desire
for
bigness
it
was
very
hard
to
promise
to
put
goloshes
upon
his
winged
feet
but
mother
held
out
her
hands
oh
i
need
you
seth
you
stay
near
me
wo
you
there
may
have
been
lordly
deeds
in
the
surf
that
night
men
gambling
their
lives
to
save
strangers
and
aliens
one
deed
there
certainly
was
though
the
movies
which
are
our
modern
minstrelsy
will
never
portray
it
while
he
strained
with
longing
to
go
down
and
show
himself
a
man
not
just
a
scullion
in
an
unsuccessful
father
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
watched
the
launch
the
boat
saw
them
disappear
from
the
radius
of
the
calcium
carbide
into
the
spume
of
surf
he
did
even
wait
to
see
them
return
mother
needed
him
and
he
trotted
back
to
tell
her
all
about
it
they
went
happily
to
bed
and
she
slept
with
her
head
cuddled
on
his
left
shoulder
his
left
arm
protectingly
about
her
it
was
still
raining
when
they
awoke
a
weary
whining
drizzle
and
father
was
still
virile
with
desire
of
heroism
he
scampered
out
to
see
what
he
could
of
the
wreck
he
returned
suddenly
his
voice
was
low
and
unhappy
as
he
demanded
oh
mother
it
come
and
see
he
led
her
to
the
kitchen
door
and
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
beloved
had
been
wrecked
by
the
storm
the
was
smashed
the
gray
bare
stems
of
the
crimson
ramblers
drooped
drearily
into
a
sullen
puddle
the
green
settee
was
smeared
with
splashed
mud
they
could
even
leave
us
that
father
wailed
in
the
voice
of
a
man
broken
oh
yes
yes
yes
i
go
to
lulu
with
you
but
we
stay
will
we
i
will
fight
again
i
did
have
a
little
gumption
left
last
night
did
i
did
i
but
but
we
go
there
for
a
while
chapter
ix
doggonit
i
liked
that
cap
it
was
a
good
one
said
father
in
a
tone
of
settled
melancholy
well
it
much
of
a
cap
said
mother
but
i
do
know
how
you
feel
they
sat
in
their
tremendously
varnished
and
room
on
the
second
floor
of
daughter
lulu
house
and
found
some
occupation
in
being
gloomy
for
ten
days
now
they
had
been
her
guests
lulu
had
received
them
with
bright
excitement
and
announced
that
they
ever
do
any
more
work
and
were
ever
so
welcome
and
then
she
had
started
to
reform
them
it
may
seem
a
mystery
as
to
why
a
woman
whose
soul
was
composed
of
vinegar
and
chicken
feathers
as
was
lulu
appleby
hartwig
should
have
wanted
her
parents
to
stay
with
her
perhaps
she
liked
them
one
does
find
such
anomalies
anyway
she
condescendingly
bought
them
new
hats
and
her
husband
a
large
man
made
lumbering
jokes
at
their
expense
and
expected
them
to
laugh
the
old
boy
still
likes
to
play
the
nothing
like
these
old
codgers
for
thinking
they
still
kids
hartwig
puffed
at
dinner
then
banged
his
fist
and
laughed
rollingly
he
seemed
surprised
when
father
merely
flushed
and
tightened
his
tie
for
all
his
gross
body
hartwig
was
sensitive
so
sensitive
that
he
was
hurt
when
people
see
the
humor
of
his
little
sallies
the
hartwigs
modest
residence
was
the
last
word
in
cement
and
small
useless
and
all
modern
inconveniences
the
furnace
heat
made
you
sneeze
and
the
chairs
which
were
large
and
tufted
creaked
in
the
was
an
electrolier
made
of
seven
kinds
of
inimical
colored
glass
and
a
from
which
were
hung
steins
on
the
parlor
table
was
a
kodak
album
with
views
of
harry
in
every
stage
of
absurdity
there
was
a
small
car
which
hartwig
drove
himself
and
there
was
a
bright
easy
incredibly
dull
social
life
neighbors
who
went
out
to
the
country
club
to
watch
the
tennis
in
summer
and
played
five
hundred
every
saturday
evening
in
the
winter
like
a
vast
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
lonely
city
new
york
the
applebys
were
unused
to
society
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
afflicted
them
more
sitting
all
day
in
their
immaculate
plastered
and
varnished
room
with
nothing
useful
to
do
or
being
dragged
into
the
midst
of
chattering
neighbors
who
treated
them
respectfully
as
though
they
were
old
mother
begged
daughter
to
be
permitted
to
dust
or
make
beds
father
suggested
that
he
might
rake
the
lawn
but
lulu
waggled
her
stringy
forefinger
at
them
and
bubbled
no
no
what
would
the
neighbors
think
do
you
suppose
that
we
can
afford
to
have
you
dear
old
people
take
a
rest
why
harris
would
be
awfully
angry
if
he
saw
you
out
puttering
around
father
no
you
just
sit
and
have
a
good
rest
and
then
when
they
had
composed
to
a
spurious
sort
of
rest
the
hands
that
were
aching
for
activity
the
applebys
would
be
dragged
out
taken
to
teas
shown
off
with
their
backs
and
handsome
heads
as
lulu
aristocratic
parents
my
father
has
been
a
prominent
business
man
in
new
york
for
many
years
you
know
she
would
confide
to
neighbors
while
the
prominent
business
man
longed
to
be
sitting
on
a
foolish
stool
trying
shoes
on
a
fussy
old
lady
but
what
could
he
do
in
actual
cash
mother
and
he
had
less
than
seven
dollars
in
the
world
by
the
end
of
two
weeks
father
and
mother
were
slowly
going
mad
with
the
quiet
of
their
room
and
lulu
was
getting
a
little
tired
of
her
experiment
in
having
a
visible
parental
background
she
began
to
let
mother
do
the
huge
uninteresting
piles
of
harris
faded
cotton
socks
and
she
snapped
at
father
when
he
was
restlessly
prowling
about
the
house
my
head
aches
so
i
sure
it
going
to
be
a
sick
headache
and
i
do
think
you
might
let
me
have
a
nap
instead
of
tramping
and
tramping
till
my
nerves
get
so
frazzled
that
i
could
just
shriek
with
this
slight
damming
of
her
flowing
fount
of
filial
love
lulu
combined
a
desire
to
have
them
appear
as
features
at
a
musicale
she
was
to
give
come
saturday
evening
mother
was
to
be
in
a
dear
ducky
lace
cap
and
father
in
a
frilled
shirt
and
a
coat
which
harris
hartwig
had
once
worn
in
theatricals
the
two
of
them
presiding
at
the
refreshments
table
like
a
prize
persian
cat
and
a
pet
monkey
father
said
against
this
indignity
they
frettingly
rebelled
father
snarled
good
lord
i
not
much
older
than
your
precious
dumpling
of
a
harris
it
was
the
snarl
of
a
caged
animal
lulu
had
them
she
merely
felt
misunderstood
when
they
protested
friday
morning
the
musicale
was
coming
next
day
and
lulu
had
already
rehearsed
them
in
their
position
as
refreshment
ornaments
father
had
boldly
refused
to
wear
the
nice
good
frilled
shirt
and
coat
during
the
rehearsal
very
well
said
lulu
but
you
will
evening
father
was
sure
whether
lulu
would
use
an
ax
or
chloroform
or
tears
on
him
but
he
was
gloomily
certain
that
she
would
have
him
in
the
shameless
garments
on
saturday
evening
there
was
a
letter
for
him
on
the
ten
morning
mail
he
receive
many
letters
one
a
month
from
joe
tubbs
relating
diverting
scandal
about
perfectly
respectable
neighbors
or
an
occasional
note
from
cousin
george
henry
of
stamford
lulu
was
acutely
curious
regarding
it
she
almost
smelled
it
with
that
quivering
nose
of
hers
that
could
tell
for
hours
afterward
whether
father
had
been
smoking
those
nasty
undignified
little
cigarettes
why
do
you
smoke
the
handsome
brier
pipe
that
harris
gave
you
she
brightly
commented
that
the
letter
was
from
boston
but
father
did
follow
her
lead
he
defensively
tucked
the
letter
in
his
inside
coat
pocket
and
trotted
to
read
it
to
mother
it
was
from
the
boston
agency
in
whose
hands
he
had
left
the
disposal
of
the
lease
and
of
their
furniture
the
agency
had
they
wrote
managed
to
break
the
lease
and
they
had
disposed
of
the
tables
and
chairs
and
some
of
the
china
they
inclosed
a
check
for
dollars
with
the
six
dollars
and
cents
left
from
their
capital
the
applebys
were
the
possessors
of
almost
dollars
gee
if
we
only
had
two
or
three
times
that
amount
we
could
run
away
and
start
again
in
new
york
and
not
let
lulu
make
us
over
into
a
darned
old
elderly
couple
father
exulted
yes
sighed
mother
you
know
and
i
know
what
a
fine
sweet
womanly
woman
lulu
has
become
but
i
do
wish
she
had
gone
and
set
her
heart
on
my
wearing
that
lace
cap
my
lands
makes
me
feel
so
old
i
just
know
myself
and
me
with
a
granddaddy
outfit
why
i
never
will
dast
to
go
out
on
the
streets
again
complained
father
i
never
did
hear
of
such
a
thing
before
they
making
us
old
and
we
begging
for
a
chance
to
be
young
and
sitting
here
and
sitting
here
and
he
looked
about
their
room
from
the
broad
window
with
its
resolutely
stiff
starched
net
curtains
to
the
very
new
bureau
and
the
brass
bed
that
looked
as
though
no
one
had
ever
dared
to
sleep
in
it
he
kicked
at
one
of
the
rugs
and
glared
at
the
expanse
of
smirkingly
clean
plaster
decorated
with
an
english
sporting
print
composed
by
an
artist
who
was
neither
english
nor
sporting
say
continued
father
i
do
like
this
room
it
too
clean
i
do
dast
to
wear
slippers
in
it
why
father
it
a
nice
room
marveled
mother
then
with
an
outburst
of
frankness
neither
do
i
it
feels
like
i
never
could
loosen
my
stays
and
read
the
funnies
in
the
last
night
paper
oh
you
need
to
look
at
me
so
many
the
time
i
did
that
when
you
were
away
at
the
store
and
i
did
have
to
sit
up
and
look
respectable
they
laughed
both
of
them
with
tender
tears
he
came
to
sit
on
the
arm
of
her
rocker
and
pat
her
hand
he
said
quietly
very
quietly
indeed
mother
we
getting
to
be
real
adventurous

very
old
about
us

guess
we
going
to
sneak

of
this
house
this
very
day
and
run
away
to
new
york
and
i

a
job
and
we
stick
right
there
in
little
old
new
york
for
the
rest
of
our
lives

his
halo
down
over
his
ears
and
he
say

ashamed
man
of
your
age
that

to
know
better
acting
up
like
a
young
smarty
and
cursing
and
swearing
and
and
cursing
and
swearing
do
forget
to
put
that
in
mother
he
was
delighted
it
was
the
first
time
since
september
that
mother
had
scolded
him
she
was
coming
back
to
life
again
he
tickled
her
under
the
chin
till
she
slapped
viciously
at
his
finger
then
he
crowed
like
a
rooster
till
a
smile
chased
away
her
lively
wrath
and
shaking
her
head
with
a
pretense
of
disgust
she
said
comfortably
i
declare
i
never
did
see
such
a
man
not
in
all
my
born
days
she
let
him
take
her
hand
again
and
their
expression
half
smiles
half
musing
was
like
the
sunshine
of
a
calm
late
afternoon
they
were
happy
for
they
knew
that
as
soon
as
they
should
have
debated
and
worried
and
planned
and
fussed
in
a
manner
appropriate
to
the
great
event
they
would
run
away
from
the
overheated
respectability
of
lulu
pretty
little
home
with
enough
agony
of
literary
effort
to
have
composed
a
war
article
and
a
column
of
household
hints
they
sinfully
devised
a
letter
for
lulu
in
which
they
stated
that
a
dear
old
friend
you
would
not
remember
him
as
we
have
met
him
since
you
were
married
writes
us
from
boston
that
he
is
sick
and
we
are
going
to
him
we
are
stealing
out
this
way
because
we
do
want
you
to
trouble
about
it
with
party
coming
on
know
you
are
so
kind
you
would
take
all
sort
of
trouble
if
knew
we
were
going
so
just
slip
away
hope
party
is
great
success
your
loving
father
mother
may
not
be
back
for
some
time
as
friend
may
need
us
in
the
wreck
of
their
fortunes
the
applebys
had
lost
their
own
furniture
down
to
the
last
beloved
picture
they
had
only
a
and
a
the
highly
modern
which
father
had
once
bought
for
a
vacation
trip
to
west
skipsit
and
the
tubbses
but
it
required
manoeuvering
to
get
even
this
light
baggage
to
the
station
mother
went
nosing
about
till
she
discovered
that
lulu
was
going
calling
that
afternoon
father
hired
an
expressman
who
was
to
be
ready
to
come
the
instant
he
telephoned
lulu
went
out
at
three
and
father
stole
to
telephone
but
the
maid
had
taken
a
fancy
to
dusting
the
where
the
telephone
lived
in
all
her
domestic
history
the
maid
had
never
done
that
before
attest
many
sarcastic
remarks
of
lulu
they
had
planned
to
catch
the
train
for
new
york
three
now
the
maid
was
polishing
the
silver
in
the
which
was
separated
from
the
only
by
an
open
arch
father
dared
not
telephone
lest
she
instantly
send
for
lulu
mother
tiptoed
down
and
the
runaways
plotted
in
whispers
upon
which
conspiracy
lulu
brightly
entered
through
the
front
door
for
a
second
father
had
a
wild
courageous
desire
to
do
the
natural
thing
to
tell
lulu
that
they
were
going
but
he
quailed
as
lulu
demanded
have
you
tried
on
the
coat
and
frilled
shirt
for
evening
yet
papa
you
know
there
may
have
to
be
some
alterations
in
them
i
sure
mama
wo
mind
making
them
will
you
mama
oh
you
two
will
be
so
cute
and
dear
i
know
everybody
will
love
you
and
it
will
give
such
a
homey
touch
that
no
i
have
tried
it
on
yet
and
i
ai
sure
i
father
gallantly
attempted
lulu
glared
at
him
and
said
in
a
voice
of
honey
and
aloes
i
sure
papa
dear
i
do
ask
very
much
of
you
and
when
i
do
ask
just
this
one
little
thing
that
i
sure
anybody
else
would
be
glad
to
help
me
with
and
me
doing
my
very
best
to
make
you
happy
no
no
no
father
did
tell
her
they
were
going
to
new
york
he
was
glad
enough
to
escape
without
having
the
monkey
coat
tried
on
him
by
force
their
suit
case
and
stood
betrayingly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
panting
anxiety
heaving
and
puffing
the
two
domestic
anarchists
lifted
the
slipped
it
under
the
bed
and
kicked
the
into
the
closet
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
next
train
to
new
york
which
left
at
eleven
at
dinner
such
a
jolly
family
dinner
with
hartwig
carving
and
emitting
little
jokes
with
harry
whining
about
his
homework
and
lulu
telling
the
maid
what
an
asphyxiated
fool
she
was
to
have
roasted
the
lamb
too
long
father
was
highly
elaborate
in
his
descriptions
of
how
he
had
tried
on
the
and
found
it
to
be
a
superb
fit
as
the
coat
was
the
personal
of
harris
hartwig
who
was
shaped
like
the
dome
of
the
county
lulu
looked
suspicious
but
harry
was
discovered
making
bread
pills
and
she
was
so
engaged
in
telling
him
what
she
thought
lord
what
a
thinker
the
little
woman
was
that
she
forgot
to
follow
the
subject
out
of
this
life
of
roast
lamb
and
lies
domesticity
and
evasions
the
applebys
plunged
into
a
tremor
of
rebellious
plotting
they
sat
in
their
room
waiting
for
the
hartwigs
to
go
to
bed
every
five
minutes
father
tiptoed
to
the
door
and
listened
at
five
minutes
past
ten
he
shook
his
fingers
with
joy
he
heard
the
hartwig
family
discursively
lumbering
up
to
bed
he
stood
at
the
door
unmoving
till
the
house
was
quiet
while
mother
nervously
hung
their
farewell
note
on
the
electric
light
and
slipped
into
her
overcoat
and
the
small
black
hat
that
was
no
longer
new
and
would
scarce
be
impressive
to
matilda
tubbs
now
they
had
decided
to
abandon
the
though
mother
made
a
bundle
of
the
more
necessary
things
the
second
the
house
was
quiet
father
was
ready
he
did
even
have
to
put
on
an
overcoat
he
any
worth
putting
on
his
old
overcoat
had
finally
gone
to
seed
and
was
the
chief
thing
abandoned
with
the
he
turned
up
his
and
slung
his
muffler
about
his
neck
put
his
brown
impudently
on
one
side
of
his
white
head
and
stood
rejuvenated
an
adventurer
just
below
their
window
was
the
roof
of
the
low
garage
which
was
built
as
part
of
the
house
father
opened
the
window
eased
out
the
followed
it
and
gave
his
hand
to
mother
who
creakingly
crawled
out
with
her
bundle
it
was
an
early
november
evening
chilly
a
mist
in
the
air
after
their
day
in
the
enervating
furnace
heat
the
breeze
seemed
biting
and
the
garage
roof
was
perilously
slippery
mother
slid
and
balanced
and
slid
on
the
roof
irritably
observing
i
declare
to
goodness
i
never
thought
that
at
my
time
of
life
i
have
to
sneak
out
of
a
window
on
to
a
nasty
slippery
like
a
thief
in
the
night
when
i
wanted
to
go
demanded
father
they
hear
us
and
lug
us
back
back
nothing
snapped
mother
now
that
i
been
and
gone
and
actually
snook
out
of
a
window
and
made
a
common
gallivanting
old
hex
out
of
myself
this
way
i
would
come
back
not
if
lulu
and
harry
and
that
lump
of
a
harris
hartwig
was
all
on
to
my
pettiskirts
and
trying
to
haul
me
back
this
last
sound
was
made
by
the
soft
mud
beside
the
garage
as
mother
landed
in
it
she
had
jumped
from
the
roof
without
once
hesitating
and
she
picked
up
her
bundle
and
waited
quite
calmly
till
father
came
flying
through
the
mist
they
had
many
minutes
to
wait
for
the
new
york
train
but
they
were
anxious
minutes
lest
lulu
or
the
lordly
harris
hartwig
descend
on
them
they
nervously
lurked
in
the
dark
doorway
of
the
with
no
overcoat
father
shivered
and
hid
the
shiver
the
engine
came
glaring
in
through
the
mist
the
train
seemed
impatient
enormous
dwarfing
the
small
station
the
prodigal
parents
hastily
tugged
and
bundle
aboard
they
found
a
seat
together
they
fussily
tucked
away
their
luggage
he
held
her
hand
firmly
concealing
the
two
hands
with
a
fold
of
her
overcoat
you
have
seen
old
folk
quite
simple
and
rustic
old
folk
who
are
apparently
unused
to
travel
sit
motionless
for
hour
after
hour
of
and
you
have
fancied
that
they
were
unconscious
of
life
of
speed
of
wonder
so
sat
father
and
mother
but
they
were
gloriously
conscious
of
each
other
and
now
and
then
when
he
was
sure
that
no
one
was
looking
he
whispered
old
honey
there
nothing
holding
us
apart
now
no
more
we
partners
again
and
lord
how
we
fight
i
go
in
and
take
pilkings
business
clean
away
from
him
i
will
old
honey
free
again
and
we
going
to
see
new
york
lord
i
just
ca
believe
it
yes
why
why
it
our
real
honeymoon
not
till
they
had
ridden
for
an
hour
did
she
demand
seth
what
we
going
to
do
in
new
york
why
fiddle
i
swear
i
do
know
but
we
find
something
i
guess
if
we
can
bamboozle
a
modern
daughter
we
wo
be
afraid
of
just
new
york
no
till
four
in
the
morning
the
applebys
sat
unmoving
awake
and
happy
when
the
train
passed
the
row
on
row
of
that
mean
new
york
no
youngster
first
seeing
the
infinitely
possible
city
and
the
future
glory
it
must
hold
for
him
was
ever
more
excited
than
the
invading
innocents
chapter
x
with
dollars
as
capital
and
a
bundle
of
garments
of
rather
uncertain
style
as
baggage
and
the
for
a
rather
good
as
insurance
and
seth
appleby
established
themselves
in
a
furnished
housekeeping
room
on
avenue
b
and
prepared
to
reconquer
new
york
it
was
youth
hopeful
sally
they
had
everything
to
gain
yet
they
were
irretrievably
past
sixty
you
may
for
many
years
have
been
a
yet
not
know
avenue
b
where
jewish
and
bakeries
are
sullenly
held
back
by
the
district
and
houses
of
muddy
halls
and
furtive
people
who
have
lost
ambition
the
genus
furnished
housekeeping
room
is
a
filthy
box
with
a
stove
a
table
a
bed
a
few
seats
many
cockroaches
and
from
one
to
twenty
people
all
thrown
in
and
shaken
up
like
a
here
in
this
world
of
tired
and
beaten
slinkers
the
innocents
with
their
fresh
faces
and
kindly
eyes
excitedly
made
themselves
another
home
with
carbolic
acid
and
soap
mother
cleaned
away
much
of
the
smell
of
former
inhabitants
while
father
propped
up
the
rusty
stove
with
a
couple
of
bricks
and
covered
the
drably
patternless
with
pictures
cut
from
old
magazines
which
he
bought
at
two
for
five
cents
on
fourteenth
street
one
of
them
was
a
chromo
of
a
child
playing
with
kittens
which
reminded
him
of
the
picture
they
had
had
in
more
prosperous
days
mother
furiously
polished
the
battered
knives
and
forks
and
arranged
the
chipped
china
on
shelves
covered
with
fresh
pink
scalloped
paper
when
she
was
away
father
secretly
pursued
the
vulgar
but
socially
conscious
sport
of
killing
cockroaches
with
a
slipper
as
the
applebys
passed
along
the
hopeless
streets
past
shops
lighted
with
single
or
through
halls
where
suspicious
women
in
frowsy
wrappers
peered
at
them
they
were
silent
but
in
their
one
room
they
were
hopeful
again
and
they
celebrated
its
redecoration
with
music
energetically
performed
by
father
on
the
also
they
ventured
to
go
out
to
dinner
in
a
real
restaurant
of
the
great
city
their
city
on
fourteenth
street
was
a
noble
inn
where
the
menu
was
printed
in
english
and
hungarian
where
for
cents
each
they
had
soup
and
goulash
and
coffee
and
pudding
in
three
colors
chloroformed
beets
and
vast
pale
pickles
electric
lights
in
red
globes
and
a
tinseled
ceiling
hung
with
artificial
flowers
the
music
of
a
violin
and
the
sight
of
eager
city
faces
i
as
excited
as
a
boy
with
his
first
pair
of
boots
declared
father
pretty
fine
to
see
people
again
heh
and
pretty
soon
we
be
dining
at
the
heh
how
you
do
run
on
said
mother
mechanically
placid
dreaminess
in
her
face
as
she
listened
to
the
violin
that
like
a
river
bore
the
flotsam
of
hungarian
and
jewish
voices
alone
jobless
yet
they
were
so
recklessly
happy
that
they
went
to
a
movie
and
watched
the
extreme
heroism
of
a
young
district
attorney
with
the
motionless
eager
credulity
of
the
as
soon
as
they
had
installed
themselves
father
edged
shyly
into
his
old
haunt
the
of
pilkings
son
he
found
son
brusquely
directing
the
cleaning
out
of
an
old
stock
of
which
pilkings
had
always
believed
would
sell
pilkings
was
bald
and
narrow
between
the
eyes
he
looked
at
father
and
nodded
as
though
it
hurt
him
i
is
your
father
around
mr
edward
father
inquired
i
did
hear
from
you
again
been
waiting
thought
maybe
i
get
a
letter
i
hope
he
has
recovered
i
know
how
bad
the
grippe
while
he
was
talking
he
realized
that
edward
pilkings
was
in
mourning
young
pilkings
looked
shallowly
grieved
and
muttered
the
old
gentleman
passed
beyond
a
week
ago
thursday
oh
edward
i
ca
tell
you
it
a
blow
to
me
a
very
great
blow
i
was
with
your
father

wonder

flowers

i
guess

nothing
to
prevent

careful
of
those
boxes

the
deuce
do
you
think
you
trying
to
do
there
that
a
little
better
try
to
show
some
sense
about
your
work
even
if
you
ai
got
any
edward
pilkings
voice
crackled
like
wood
in
a
fireplace
desperately
father
tried
again
fact
is
edward
i
given
up
my
on
cape
cod
did
go
so
very
well
i
guess
my
forty
like
the
fellow
says
is
sticking
to
selling
shoes
appleby
and
i
have
just
got
back
to
town
and
got
settled
down
and
fact
is
i
be
glad
to
go
back
to
work
his
hesitant
manner
invited
refusal
it
was
evident
that
edward
pilkings
was
not
interested
shyly
father
added
you
know
your
father
promised
to
keep
a
place
open
for
me
well
now
i
tell
you
appleby
it
ai
that
you
are
a
good
salesman
but
just
i
well
kind
of
reorganizing
the
business
i
sort
of
feel
the
establishment
ought
to
have
a
little
more
pep
in
it
and
so
you
see
but
you
leave
your
address
and
as
soon
as
anything
turns
up
i
be
mighty
glad
to
let
you
know
for
years
father
had
pityingly
heard
applicants
for
jobs
disposed
of
with
the
request
to
leave
their
addresses
no
he
said
no
maybe
i
come
in
and
see
you
again
some
day
good
day
good
luck
to
you
mr
edward
he
greeted
his
old
acquaintances
among
the
clerks
they
were
cordial
but
they
kept
an
eye
on
edward
pilkings
he
shivered
as
he
walked
out
it
was
warm
and
busy
in
the
but
outside
it
was
rather
chilly
for
a
man
with
no
overcoat
or
job
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
should
have
found
his
one
place
of
refuge
closed
to
him
he
walked
from
to
hopelessly
place
the
said
when
he
mentioned
his
experience
with
pilkings
son
be
glad
to
do
what
we
can
for
you
appleby
but
just
now
he
had
reached
the
section
already
the
holiday
rush
had
begun
holly
was
in
the
windows
salvation
army
solicitors
tinkled
irritating
bells
on
every
corner
department
stores
had
always
rather
bewildered
this
man
of
small
business
but
he
inquired
for
the
bureau
in
the
largest
of
them
and
his
shyness
disappeared
as
he
found
a
long
line
of
applicants
filling
out
blanks
here
he
did
not
have
to
plead
with
some
one
man
for
the
chance
to
work
he
was
handled
quickly
and
efficiently
on
a
blank
he
gave
his
age
his
experience
how
much
he
expected
and
a
brisk
impersonal
clerk
told
him
to
return
next
day
on
that
next
day
the
world
became
wonderful
for
father
wonderful
and
young
again
for
some
one
did
actually
want
him
he
had
a
temporary
job
in
the
department
at
eight
dollars
a
week
father
first
day
of
work
in
the
department
was
the
most
difficult
he
had
ever
known
his
knowledge
of
shoes
and
leather
had
become
purely
mechanical
a
few
glances
at
new
stock
and
at
trade
journals
had
kept
him
aware
of
changing
styles
now
he
had
suddenly
to
become
omniscient
in
regard
to
portfolios
learn
leathers
which
he
had
never
handled
walrus
√©cras√©
he
had
to
appear
placidly
official
almost
pontifical
when
vague
ladies
appeared
poked
clippings
from
holiday
magazines
at
him
and
demanded
i
want
something
like
that
that
usually
depicted
articles
of
whose
use
he
had
the
most
indefinite
notions
other
ladies
ponderous
ladies
who
wanted
vast
quantities
of
free
advice
before
purchasing
christmas
presents
desired
encyclopedic
information
about
traveling
and
a
cover
for
my
social
register
and
i
want
you
to
be
sure
it
the
very
latest
thing
he
was
defenseless
he
could
not
dodge
them
anybody
could
come
up
and
ask
him
anything
and
did
and
while
he
could
learn
something
about
the
new
leathers
still
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
remember
the
long
island
railroad
well
enough
to
reply
instantly
when
an
irate
shopper
snapped
at
him
do
you
know
what
the
next
train
for
hempstead
the
most
woman
in
a
has
at
least
a
definite
tangible
foot
to
fit
but
the
holiday
crowd
were
buying
presents
for
persons
of
whom
father
knew
nothing
though
the
shoppers
expected
him
to
know
everything
from
the
sizes
of
their
wrists
to
their
tastes
in
they
haggled
and
pushed
and
crowded
they
wanted
it
to
be
less
expensive
as
well
as
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
he
spent
twenty
minutes
in
showing
the
entire
line
of
diaries
to
one
woman
she
apparently
desired
to
make
sure
that
they
were
all
of
them
moral
or
something
of
the
sort
at
the
end
of
the
time
she
sighed
oh
dear
it
is
time
for
the
matin√©e
even
yet
shopping
is
so
hard
and
oozed
away
into
the
crowd
father
had
started
his
first
day
with
a
superior
manner
of
knowing
all
about
leather
and
the
ways
of
cranky
customers
he
ended
it
with
a
depressed
feeling
that
he
knew
nothing
about
anything
that
he
keep
up
the
holiday
pace
of
the
younger
clerks
and
that
the
assistant
buyer
of
the
department
had
been
watching
him
he
walked
home
with
strained
weary
shoulders
but
as
he
turned
into
the
gloomy
hallway
leading
to
their
room
he
artificially
brightened
his
expression
that
he
might
bring
joy
home
to
mother
who
would
have
been
lonely
and
anxious
and
waiting
all
day
he
pictured
her
as
sitting
there
hunched
up
depressed
he
would
bounce
in
with
news
of
a
good
day
he
tried
the
door
carefully
mother
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
a
dream
in
the
dimness
of
the
room
the
coal
fire
shone
through
the
front
draught
of
the
stove
and
threw
a
faint
rose
on
her
crossed
hands
taller
she
seemed
and
more
commanding
her
head
was
back
her
eyes
sparkling
she
was
and
strong
against
the
unkempt
walls
why
mother
you
look
so
happy
what
is
it
i
going
to
help
i
not
going
to
be
a
lazybones
i
got
a
job
too
in
the
at
regalberg
and
they
are
going
to
pay
me
nine
dollars
a
week
how
that
for
your
stupid
old
woman
why
why
you
do
need
i
do
know
as
i
like
began
the
conventional
old
father
to
whom
woman
place
was
in
the
home
whether
or
not
there
was
a
home
in
which
to
have
a
place
then
the
new
father
the
adventurer
declared
i
think
it
mighty
fine
mother
mighty
fine
if
it
wo
be
too
hard
on
you
i
going
to
take
you
to
dinner
instead
of
you
taking
me
that
is
if
you
lend
me
a
dollar
laughing
till
they
nearly
cried
with
father
shamelessly
squeezing
her
arm
on
public
thoroughfares
they
again
plunged
into
the
roman
pleasures
of
the
little
tinsel
restaurant
and
like
two
lovers
like
the
in
your
office
and
the
clerk
next
door
they
made
an
engagement
to
meet
at
noon
next
day
in
a
restaurant
between
regalberg
and
father
store
when
she
came
breathlessly
into
that
and
restaurant
at
noon
mother
already
had
something
of
the
busy
look
of
the
woman
who
can
compete
with
men
her
cheeks
were
flushed
with
walking
her
eyes
were
young
she
glanced
about
the
room
found
father
smiled
quickly
and
proceeded
to
order
her
own
lunch
in
a
way
they
told
me
to
be
back
in
half
an
hour
she
said
but
i
do
mind
a
bit
it
been
nice
all
morning
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ever
did
have
all
the
children
to
talk
to
that
i
wanted
and
the
sweet
toys
think
of
me
gadding
around
like
this
and
enjoying
it
i
swear
to
goodness
i
do
know
myself
and
what
do
you
think
i
going
to
do
if
either
of
us
gets
a
raise
i
going
to
buy
you
an
overcoat
father
felt
that
he
did
know
her
either
she
did
most
of
the
talking
at
lunch
and
hurried
cheerfully
back
to
her
job
while
father
plodded
wearily
away
speculating
as
to
whether
he
could
keep
bustling
on
tired
stinging
feet
till
six
like
the
younger
holiday
help
with
whom
he
was
in
competition
he
could
seem
to
please
the
assistant
buyer
of
the
department
at
all
that
afternoon
though
in
his
eager
way
he
tried
to
be
the
perfect
salesman
on
saturday
morning
there
was
a
little
note
for
him
in
which
the
superintendent
was
obsequiously
father
servant
and
humbly
informed
father
that
his
services
would
be
needed
after
that
day
would
he
if
it
was
quite
convenient
call
for
his
pay
the
following
tuesday
and
not
fail
to
turn
in
his
before
leaving
the
establishment
the
assistant
buyer
came
around
and
unhappily
told
father
that
they
were
letting
him
go
because
the
department
was
overstocked
with
younger
liver
men
i
mighty
sorry
and
i
wish
you
good
luck
he
said
with
flash
of
the
real
man
under
the
smooth
steely
exterior
father
scarcely
heard
him
though
he
smiled
faintly
he
read
the
note
many
times
as
he
stumbled
home
but
he
could
get
himself
to
show
it
to
mother
till
sunday
afternoon
so
proud
was
she
of
helping
him
and
proving
herself
a
business
woman
succeeding
in
a
job
while
father
who
had
once
been
worth
good
dollars
a
week
been
able
to
keep
an
job
being
quite
human
father
felt
a
scornful
envy
of
her
for
a
minute
when
she
repeated
all
the
pleasant
things
that
had
been
said
to
her
but
she
was
so
frank
so
touchingly
happy
that
he
could
not
long
harden
his
heart
when
he
told
her
of
his
she
put
her
hand
to
her
breast
and
looked
desperately
afraid
it
was
only
with
a
dry
gasp
that
she
could
say
never
mind
seth
you
find
something
else
i
glad
you
have
to
handle
all
those
silly
and
all
and
so
so
oh
i
do
hope
you
find
something
you
wo
think
i
entirely
a
failure
i
wo
have
you
use
that
word
do
i
know
have
i
seen
you
for
years
why
i
depend
on
you
like
it
sounds
like
a
honeymoon
but
just
about
my
religion
seth
but
she
went
to
bed
very
early
to
be
absolutely
certain
of
being
on
time
at
regalberg
monday
morning
so
began
for
seth
appleby
the
haunted
days
when
drifting
through
the
gray
and
ghostly
city
of
winter
he
scarce
knew
whether
he
was
a
real
man
or
a
ghost
down
prison
corridors
that
the
city
calls
streets
among
jewish
and
italian
firms
of
which
he
had
never
heard
he
wandered
aimlessly
asking
with
more
and
more
diffidence
for
work
any
kind
of
work
his
shoes
were
ground
down
at
the
heel
now
and
cracked
open
on
one
side
in
such
footgear
he
dared
not
enter
a
his
own
realm
to
ask
for
work
that
he
really
could
do
as
his
december
drifted
toward
christmas
like
a
rudderless
steamer
in
a
fog
the
cold
permitted
him
to
seek
for
work
only
an
hour
or
two
a
day
for
he
had
no
overcoat
and
his
coat
was
very
thin
seth
appleby
did
think
of
himself
as
one
of
the
rank
of
paupers
but
rather
as
a
man
who
did
have
an
overcoat
he
had
the
grippe
and
for
a
week
he
never
left
the
house
while
mother
proudly
carried
on
the
he
tried
to
do
the
with
unskilled
hands
he
swept
leaving
snags
of
dirt
in
the
corners
he
washed
breaking
a
dish
now
and
then
he
even
got
down
on
protesting
sore
knees
and
sloshed
around
in
an
attempt
at
scrubbing
the
knotty
splintery
floor
he
tried
to
cook
dinner
and
breakfast
but
his
repertoire
consisted
of
frying
fried
eggs
fried
bacon
fried
bread
fried
pork
chops
which
mother
pretended
to
like
though
they
gave
her
spasms
of
indigestion
in
the
richest
city
in
the
world
he
haggled
with
abusive
peddlers
over
five
cents
worth
of
cabbage
he
was
patient
but
wrinkled
with
hopelessness
with
two
warm
days
in
succession
and
the
grippe
gone
father
found
work
as
a
noontime
waiter
in
a
piggery
on
third
avenue
where
workmen
devoured
stew
and
sour
coffee
and
the
waiters
rushed
gaspingly
about
in
filthy
white
aprons
after
the
lunch
hour
he
washed
dishes
in
soapy
water
that
quickly
changed
from
white
to
black
for
this
he
received
fifty
cents
a
day
and
his
lunch
he
hid
the
depressing
fact
of
such
employment
from
mother
but
religiously
saved
the
daily
fifty
cents
to
give
to
her
at
christmas
he
even
walked
for
an
hour
after
each
lunch
to
get
the
smell
of
grease
out
of
his
clothes
lest
she
suspect
a
patient
quiet
anxious
courteous
little
aging
man
in
a
that
was
noisy
as
a
subway
nasty
as
a
sewer
excavation
without
admitting
it
to
himself
he
had
practically
given
up
the
search
for
work
after
christmas
something
would
happen
he
did
know
what
anyway
they
would
go
back
to
their
daughter
unless
mother
became
ill
he
discovered
the
life
of
idle
men
in
new
york
not
the
clubmen
but
those
others
shabby
shuffling
his
turned
up
and
secured
with
a
he
poked
through
tompkins
square
on
sunny
days
or
talked
for
hours
to
hoboes
who
scorned
him
as
a
man
without
experience
of
and
rods
of
hoboes
hangouts
and
the
municipal
lodging
house
when
it
was
too
cold
to
sit
in
the
park
he
tried
to
make
himself
respectable
of
aspect
by
turning
down
his
and
straightening
his
streaky
tie
before
he
stalked
into
the
tompkins
square
branch
of
the
public
library
where
for
hours
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
magazines
on
whose
text
he
could
concentrate
less
each
day
that
he
was
an
outcast
accepting
his
fate
when
he
came
out
the
cold
took
him
like
the
pain
of
neuralgia
and
through
streets
that
were
a
smear
of
snow
and
dust
and
blackened
remains
of
small
boys
bonfires
he
shuffled
off
with
timorous
rapidity
eying
shop
windows
full
of
cheap
bread
cheap
cakes
cheap
overcoats
cheap
novels
on
the
joy
of
being
poor
all
too
expensive
for
him
clean
and
upright
and
longing
to
be
merry
in
a
dour
world
he
sank
down
among
the
spotted
the
shiftless
the
worthless
but
perhaps
when
he
struck
bottom
he
was
not
quite
beaten
he
never
varied
in
the
wistful
welcome
he
gave
to
mother
when
she
dragged
herself
home
from
work
but
with
an
increasing
humbleness
he
accepted
her
as
the
master
of
the
house
and
she
unconsciously
took
the
r√¥le
she
petted
him
and
comforted
him
and
worked
for
him
she
announced
with
the
gaiety
that
one
uses
with
a
dependent
small
boy
that
they
would
have
a
wonderful
party
on
christmas
eve
and
with
the
animation
of
a
dependent
child
he
begged
her
to
tell
him
about
it
chapter
xi
the
day
before
christmas
an
anxious
day
in
regalberg
department
store
where
the
extra
help
were
wondering
which
of
them
would
be
kept
on
most
of
them
were
given
dismissals
with
their
mother
fate
was
not
decided
she
was
told
to
report
on
the
following
monday
the
would
be
reduced
but
possibly
they
would
find
a
place
for
her
in
the
children
dresses
department
for
the
january
white
sale
at
the
very
least
they
would
be
glad
to
give
her
an
excellent
recommendation
the
buyer
told
her
more
distraught
than
one
stunned
by
utter
hopelessness
and
ruin
she
came
home
and
as
father
had
once
been
wont
to
do
for
her
she
made
her
face
bright
to
deceive
him
under
her
arm
she
carried
a
wonderful
surprise
a
very
large
bundle
father
was
agitated
about
it
when
she
plumped
gaily
into
their
housekeeping
room
at
last
she
let
him
open
it
he
found
an
overcoat
a
great
warm
overcoat
he
had
an
overcoat
an
overcoat
he
could
put
it
on
any
time
and
go
about
the
streets
without
the
pinned
which
is
the
sign
of
the
hobo
he
could
walk
all
day
looking
for
a
job
warm
and
prosperous
he
could
find
work
and
support
mother
he
had
an
overcoat
he
was
a
gentleman
again
with
tears
he
kissed
her
lingeringly
then
produced
his
own
present
which
he
had
meant
to
keep
till
christmas
day
itself
it
was
seven
dollars
which
he
had
earned
as
waiter
at
the
piggery
and
we
going
out
and
have
dinner
on
it
too
he
insisted
yes
yes
we
will
we
been
economizing
so
much
but
before
they
went
they
carefully
cached
in
the
the
cabbage
he
had
cooked
for
dinner
with
a
slow
luxurious
joy
in
every
movement
he
put
on
the
overcoat
even
in
the
pocket
in
which
he
stuck
the
seven
christmas
dollars
he
had
a
distinct
pleasure
for
his
undercoat
pockets
were
too
torn
too
holey
to
carry
anything
in
them
they
went
prancing
to
the
hungarian
restaurant
they
laughed
so
much
that
father
forgot
to
probe
her
about
the
overcoat
and
did
not
learn
that
she
had
bought
it
for
three
dollars
and
had
saved
the
three
dollars
by
omitting
lunch
for
nearly
four
weeks
they
had
a
table
at
the
front
of
the
restaurant
near
the
violin
they
glowed
over
soup
and
real
meat
and
coffee
there
were
funny
people
at
the
next
table
a
man
who
made
jokes
something
about
the
yiddisher
gavotte
and
saying
we
been
going
to
dances
a
lot
but
last
night
the
wife
and
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
so
i
bought
me
two
front
seats
for
grant
tomb
it
was
tremendous
father
and
mother
could
make
many
jokes
these
days
but
they
listened
and
laughed
the
waiter
remembered
them
they
had
always
tipped
him
ten
cents
he
kept
coming
back
to
see
if
there
was
anything
they
wanted
as
though
they
were
important
people
father
thanked
her
for
the
overcoat
in
what
he
blithely
declared
to
be
cape
cod
dialect
and
toasted
her
in
coffee
they
were
crammed
with
good
cheer
when
mother
paid
the
check
from
a
dollar
she
had
left
over
and
they
rose
from
the
table
father
stood
perplexedly
gazing
at
the
behind
them
he
gasped
why
where
why
i
hung
it
he
took
down
his
old
hat
with
a
pathetic
bewildered
hesitancy
and
he
whispered
to
mother
my
overcoat
is
gone
it
been
stolen
my
new
overcoat
now
i
ca
go
out
and
get
a
job
they
cried
out
and
demanded
restitution
of
the
waiter
the
the
manager
none
of
these
officials
could
do
more
than
listen
and
ask
heavy
questions
in
bad
english
and
ejaculate
somebody
stole
it
from
right
behind
you
there
when
you
were
looking
one
of
the
guests
dramatically
said
that
he
had
seen
a
man
who
looked
suspicious
and
for
a
moment
every
one
paid
attention
to
him
but
that
was
all
the
information
he
had
the
other
guests
gazed
with
apathetic
interest
stirring
their
coffee
and
grunting
one
to
another
he
ought
to
watched
it
the
manager
pointed
at
one
of
the
signs
this
restaurant
is
not
responsible
for
the
loss
of
hats
coats
or
packages
and
he
shouted
i
am
very
sorry
but
we
can
do
nuttin
somebody
stole
it
from
right
behind
you
there
no
one
was
looking
if
you
leaf
your
name
and
address
father
did
even
hear
him
he
was
muttering
to
himself
and
the
seven
dollars
that
i
saved
for
sarah
was
in
it
he
took
mother
arm
he
tried
to
walk
straight
as
he
turned
his
back
on
the
storm
of
windy
words
from
the
manager
once
they
were
away
from
spectators
on
dark
fifteenth
street
father
threw
up
his
hands
and
in
a
voice
of
utter
agony
he
mourned
i
ca
do
anything
more
i
clean
beaten
i
tried
and
i
looked
for
work
but
now
be
better
if
i
went
and
jumped
in
the
river
she
took
his
arm
and
led
him
along
as
though
he
were
a
child
and
helpless
she
comforted
him
as
well
as
she
could
but
there
was
nothing
very
convincing
to
say
as
she
grew
silent
her
thoughts
grew
noisy
they
shouted
separate
hard
brutal
sentences
so
loudly
that
she
could
not
hear
even
the
scraping
feet
of
the
stooped
man
beside
her
they
clamored
i
ca
do
anything
more
either
i
do
believe
i
will
be
kept
on
at
the
store
after
all
only
through
january
anyway
all
the
money
we
got
now
is
the
nine
dollars
they
gave
me
suppose
that
been
stolen
too
from
our
room
suppose
i
died
what
would
happen
to
father
if
i
died
he
have
to
go
some
dreadful
place
or
some
place
what
would
happen
to
me
if
he
died
i
be
so
lonely
i
could
stand
it
he
always
been
so
dear
to
me
that
clerk
in
the
that
died
from
asphyxiation
i
wonder
if
it
was
accident
after
all
they
said
so
but
she
was
so
unhappy
and
all
when
she
talked
to
me
at
lunch
jump
in
the
river
that
would
be
cold
and
he
has
got
an
overcoat
no
of
course
that
would
make
any
difference
i
wonder
if
gas
suicide
hurts
much
if
we
could
only
die
together
and
neither
of
us
be
left
god
would
call
that
suicide
oh
he
could
not
when
there
two
people
that
nobody
wants
and
they
do
ask
anything
but
just
to
be
together
that
nobody
really
wants
my
daughter
do
except
maybe
the
tubbses
and
they
are
so
poor
too
nobody
needs
us
and
we
just
want
to
find
a
happy
way
to
go
off
together
where
we
can
sleep
oh
i
think
that
would
be
wrong
would
it
they
were
at
home
she
hastened
to
burrow
among
the
pile
of
stewpans
for
the
nine
dollars
her
week
salary
which
she
had
hidden
there
when
she
found
that
it
was
safe
she
did
care
so
much
after
all
what
difference
would
it
have
made
if
the
money
had
been
gone
father
staggered
like
a
drunkard
to
one
of
the
flimsy
straight
uncomfortable
chairs
but
he
got
himself
up
and
tried
to
play
on
the
a
careless
tune
of
grassy
hills
and
a
summer
breeze
while
he
played
he
ridiculed
himself
for
such
agony
over
the
loss
of
an
overcoat
but
his
philosophizing
did
mean
anything
he
had
lost
the
chance
of
finding
work
when
he
had
lost
the
overcoat
he
could
really
think
and
the
feeble
trickle
of
music
had
a
tragic
absurdity
he
petulantly
threw
the
on
the
bed
then
himself
slumped
on
the
coverlet
his
face
was
grayly
hopeless
like
ashes
or
dust
or
the
snow
of
great
cities
mother
had
been
brooding
she
was
only
distantly
conscious
of
his
final
collapse
she
said
suddenly
bluntly
let
go
away
together
if
we
could
only
die
while
we
are
still
together
and
have
some
nice
things
to
remember
hers
was
the
less
conventional
mind
of
the
two
he
protested
but
it
was
a
feeble
mumble
the
world
had
come
to
seem
unreal
the
question
of
leaving
it
rather
unimportant
much
they
talked
possibly
for
hours
but
the
talk
was
as
confused
as
the
spatter
of
furniture
in
that
room
lighted
by
a
all
that
they
said
was
but
repetition
of
her
first
demand
while
he
lay
on
the
bed
flat
his
arms
out
like
a
prisoner
on
a
rack
wondering
why
all
his
thoughts
had
become
a
void
in
which
he
could
find
no
words
with
which
to
answer
her
she
slowly
stood
up
turned
out
the
gas
then
again
opened
the
she
hastily
stripped
off
her
overcoat
and
fitted
it
over
the
crack
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
where
showed
a
strip
of
light
from
the
slimy
hall
without
she
caught
up
the
red
cotton
and
stuffed
it
along
the
window
moving
clumsily
through
the
room
in
which
the
darkness
was
broken
only
by
pallid
light
that
seeped
through
the
window
from
cold
walls
without
she
staggered
over
and
lay
down
beside
him
her
work
was
done
and
in
the
darkness
her
worried
frown
changed
to
a
smile
of
divine
and
mothering
kindliness
which
did
not
lessen
as
a
thin
stinging
acid
vapor
of
illuminating
gas
bit
at
her
throat
and
made
her
cough
father
raised
his
head
in
stupefied
alarm
she
drew
him
down
put
his
head
on
her
shoulder
she
took
his
hand
to
lead
him
her
little
boy
into
a
land
of
summer
dreams
where
they
would
always
be
together
the
innocents
were
going
their
way
asking
no
one
permission
yet
harming
no
one
his
hand
was
twitching
a
little
he
coughed
with
a
sound
of
hurt
bewilderment
but
she
held
his
hand
firmly
and
over
this
first
rough
part
of
the
road
the
mother
of
tenderness
led
him
pityingly
on
chapter
xii
out
of
a
black
curdled
ocean
where
for
ages
he
had
struggled
and
stifled
seth
appleby
raised
his
head
for
an
instant
and
sank
again
for
longer
ages
and
more
black
more
terrible
he
fought
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
of
life
he
had
reached
the
bottom
now
he
began
to
rise
his
coughing
was
shaking
him
into
a
and
very
dimly
he
heard
her
cough
too
he
feverishly
threw
out
one
hand
it
struck
the
he
had
thrown
upon
the
bed
struck
it
sharply
with
a
pain
that
pierced
to
his
he
had
the
dismaying
thought
i
never
play
the
to
her
again
we
wo
ever
sit
in
the
while
i
play
the
to
her
where
is
she
yes
yes
this
is
her
hand
he
was
trying
to
think
now
something
said
to
him
sharply
suicide
is
wicked
yes
he
reflected
in
the
tangles
of
a
he
had
always
been
told
that
suicide
was
wicked
let
see
what
was
it
he
was
trying
to
think
suicide
wicked
blame
the
cowards
who
killed
themselves
suicide
wicked
no
no
that
was
the
thought
he
was
trying
to
lay
hold
of
what
was
it
he
was
trying
to
think
suicide
wicked
god
how
this
cough
hurt
him
what
was
it
suicide
no
he
violently
pushed
away
the
thought
of
suicide
and
its
wickedness
and
at
last
shouted
within
himself
oh
that
what
i
was
thinking
i
must
play
to
mother
again
where
is
she
she
needs
me
she
off
somewhere
she
helpless
she
calling
for
me
my
poor
little
girl
he
hurled
himself
off
the
bed
to
find
her
in
that
cold
darkness
he
stood
wavering
under
the
why
oh
yes
we
turned
on
the
gas
he
realized
he
thrust
his
hand
up
and
reached
the
then
staggering
feeling
inch
by
inch
for
leagues
along
the
edge
of
the
cupboard
raising
his
ponderous
hand
with
infinite
effort
he
touched
a
plate
feebly
fitted
his
fingers
over
its
edge
and
with
a
gesture
of
weak
despair
hurled
it
at
the
window
the
glass
shattered
he
fell
to
the
floor
strained
with
weeks
of
trying
to
appear
young
and
brisk
in
the
store
mother
had
become
insensible
before
the
gas
could
overcome
him
and
he
awoke
there
limp
on
the
floor
before
she
revived
the
room
was
still
foul
with
and
very
cold
for
they
had
not
rekindled
the
fire
when
they
had
returned
after
dinner
he
feebly
opened
the
window
even
the
door
a
passing
woman
cried
gas
in
the
room
my
gawd
my
old
man
almost
croaked
himself
last
year
with
one
of
them
quarter
meters
she
bustled
in
a
corpulent
baggy
unclean
kindly
effectual
soul
and
helped
him
fan
the
gas
out
of
the
room
she
drove
away
other
inquisitive
neighbors
revived
mother
appleby
and
left
them
with
words
of
cheer
muttering
that
her
old
man
would
kill
her
if
she
did
get
a
hustle
on
herself
and
chase
that
growler
with
the
broken
stuffed
up
the
gas
lighted
and
the
fire
started
the
applebys
faced
life
again
and
were
very
glad
they
could
have
been
long
under
the
gas
father
eons
of
drowning
struggle
must
have
been
seconds
propped
up
in
bed
mother
refused
a
doctor
and
smiled
though
confusedly
with
the
bewilderment
of
one
who
had
felt
the
numbness
of
death
i
tell
you
how
it
is
cried
father
we
how
glad
i
am
to
have
you
again
it
like
this
we
felt
as
if
we
gone
the
very
limit
and
nothing
ever
would
come
right
again
but
it
just
like
when
we
were
a
young
married
couple
and
scrapped
and
were
so
darn
certain
we
have
to
leave
each
other
that
the
way
it
been
with
us
lately
and
we
needed
something
big
like
this
to
get
our
nerve
up
i
guess
now
start
off
again
and
think
honey
whatever
we
do
will
be
a
it
be
so
much
bigger
than
nothing
let
see
new
york
does
want
us
but
somewhere
there
must
be
a
village
of
folks
that
does
we
start
out
right
now
walking
through
new
york
and
we
hunt
till
we
find
it
even
if
we
have
to
go
clean
out
to
san
francisco
gee
think
we
free
no
job
or
nothing
and
we
could
go
to
san
francisco
travel
like
we
always
wanted
to
and
we
wo
have
any
more
pride
now
to
bother
us
not
after
that
i
play
the
for
pennies
come
on
we
start
for
japan
and
see
the
come
on
old
partner
we
going
to
pioneer
like
our
daddies
that
went
west
and
he
struck
up
susanna
on
his
chapter
xiii
the
applebys
did
start
for
japan
on
christmas
eve
also
they
go
defiantly
with
pack
on
back
through
the
streets
of
new
york
like
immigrants
to
youth
it
took
mother
appleby
two
days
to
recover
from
gas
and
two
more
to
recover
from
lifelong
respectability
to
the
end
that
she
should
become
a
merry
beggar
gathering
pennies
while
father
piped
upon
that
antic
instrument
the
father
labored
with
her
and
cooked
beans
for
her
she
made
him
agree
to
get
as
far
from
new
york
as
their
nine
dollars
would
take
them
before
they
should
begin
to
be
vagrants
it
always
easier
to
be
a
bold
adventurer
in
some
town
other
than
the
one
in
which
you
are
the
train
took
them
about
eighty
miles
into
new
jersey
they
debouched
rather
shyly
and
stood
on
the
station
platform
in
a
town
consisting
of
a
trust
a
saloon
a
druggist
and
a
general
store
the
station
loafers
stared
at
them
father
would
no
more
have
dared
play
the
to
these
gangling
youths
than
he
would
have
dared
kiss
a
traffic
policeman
at
and
fifth
avenue
they
edged
around
the
corner
of
the
station
and
gingerly
stepped
off
into
an
ocean
of
slush
deaf
to
the
yells
of
the
who
hopefully
represented
that
he
would
take
them
practically
anywhere
in
the
world
for
fifty
cents
they
were
an
odd
couple
father
had
no
need
of
an
overcoat
now
he
was
wearing
three
shirts
two
waistcoats
two
pairs
of
trousers
and
three
pairs
of
socks
to
say
nothing
of
certain
pages
of
an
evening
newspaper
cunningly
distributed
through
his
garments
crackly
but
warm
he
waddled
chubbily
and
somewhat
stiffly
but
he
outfaced
the
winter
wind
as
he
had
not
done
for
many
weeks
in
this
outfit
he
could
never
have
gone
the
rounds
of
offices
looking
for
work
but
in
the
open
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
hardy
woodsman
or
at
least
the
father
of
a
woodsman
he
wore
defiantly
the
romantic
wreck
of
that
plaid
cap
which
he
had
bought
for
cape
cod
which
his
daughter
had
sequestered
at
saserkopee
and
which
he
had
stolen
back
from
her
also
he
had
a
secret
joy
in
the
fact
that
his
shirt
that
is
his
outer
and
most
visible
shirt
was
a
coarse
garment
of
blue
flannel
a
very
virile
and
knightly
tabard
with
large
white
buttons
which
mother
had
never
let
him
wear
in
public
it
was
such
a
noble
habiliment
as
a
fireman
might
have
worn
or
a
longshoreman
or
boone
mother
was
almost
equally
bulky
with
an
unassayed
number
of
garments
but
over
them
all
she
wore
a
still
respectable
raglan
town
coat
they
both
carried
bundles
and
in
father
right
hand
was
a
red
pasteboard
case
which
protected
the
this
as
they
modestly
trotted
through
the
village
he
tried
to
conceal
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
he
glared
at
a
totally
innocent
whom
he
suspected
of
wanting
to
hear
the
mother
did
know
of
his
mental
struggles
she
was
thinking
more
about
her
feet
she
looked
up
with
mild
astonishment
when
as
they
left
the
town
by
the
highroad
southward
father
burst
out
i
play
if
i
want
to
but
i
ca
stand
the
gawping
gumps
here
why
father
she
said
trustingly
the
noontime
sun
came
out
to
conceal
from
his
stomach
the
fact
that
it
was
hungry
father
grew
boyishly
enthusiastic
about
going
southward
gee
he
burbled
we
hit
down
toward
florida
palms
and
alligators
and
and
everything
land
of
flowers
what
this
hotel
the
royal
points
de
anna
play
the
there
make
a
hit
then
strike
new
orleans
and
jump
to
san
francisco
gee
it
a
long
way
between
houses
along
here
they
approached
a
father
was
tremendously
urging
himself
to
play
the
there
to
skip
and
be
nimble
and
gain
a
meed
meaning
lunch
frowning
with
intentness
he
stopped
before
the
house
mother
meekly
halted
beside
him
she
had
not
lost
quite
all
of
the
training
in
she
had
got
from
a
business
life
these
last
weeks
but
she
looked
to
him
for
leadership
in
the
new
existence
father
swung
his
shapeless
pack
from
his
shoulders
set
it
down
on
the
ground
reluctantly
drew
his
from
its
case
he
became
aware
that
a
large
astonished
woman
was
staring
from
the
kitchen
window
he
stared
back
the
was
left
suspended
in
air
hastily
he
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
and
as
though
hypnotized
moved
toward
the
kitchen
door
he
had
to
give
the
woman
some
explanation
for
encamping
in
her
yard
why
she
might
have
thought
that
he
had
intended
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
playing
the
there
the
woman
opened
the
door
curiously
stared
over
father
head
at
mother
then
back
at
the
little
man
with
his
pink
cheery
face
and
whiff
of
delicate
silver
hair
i
uh
i
could
i
cut
some
wood
or
something
for
you
said
father
uh
smith
and
i
are
tramping
across
the
united
states
san
francisco
and
new
orleans
and
so
on
and
why
you
poor
things
you
must
be
terribly
cold
and
tired
think
of
it
san
francisco
you
tell
smith
to
come
right
in
and
warm
herself
by
the
fire
and
i
guess
i
can
find
some
dinner
for
both
of
you
father
scuttled
out
informed
mother
that
she
had
become
smith
and
before
her
slightly
dazed
mind
could
grasp
it
all
she
was
in
at
a
kitchen
table
near
the
stove
and
eating
doughnuts
salt
pork
beans
apple
pie
and
vast
cups
of
coffee
not
but
that
father
himself
was
also
laying
in
the
food
with
a
lustiness
that
justified
his
shirt
from
time
to
time
he
dutifully
mentioned
his
project
of
cutting
wood
but
the
woman
was
more
interested
in
him
as
a
symbol
in
a
dim
quite
unanalytic
way
father
perceived
that
to
this
woman
this
drab
prisoner
of
kitchen
and
woodshed
it
was
wonderful
to
meet
a
man
and
woman
who
had
actually
started
for
anywhere
she
sighed
and
with
a
look
of
remembering
old
dreams
she
declared
i
wish
my
old
man
and
i
could
do
that
gawd
i
would
care
how
cold
we
got
just
get
away
for
a
month
then
i
be
willing
to
come
back
here
and
go
on
cooking
up
messes
he
goes
into
town
almost
every
day
in
winter
he
there
now
but
i
stay
here
and
just
work
father
understood
that
it
would
have
desecrated
her
vision
of
the
heroic
had
he
played
the
for
pay
perceived
that
she
did
even
want
him
to
chop
wood
mother
and
he
were
to
this
woman
a
proof
that
freedom
and
love
and
distant
skies
did
actually
exist
and
that
people
just
folks
not
rich
could
go
and
find
them
when
she
had
warmed
mother
feet
and
given
them
her
wistful
good
wishes
the
woman
let
them
go
and
the
smiths
recently
applebys
went
comfortably
and
plumply
two
more
miles
on
their
way
to
japan
father
conscience
was
troubling
him
not
because
he
had
taken
food
from
the
woman
she
had
bestowed
it
with
the
friendly
and
unpatronizing
graciousness
of
poor
women
but
because
he
had
been
too
cowardly
to
play
the
when
mother
had
begun
to
walk
wearily
and
father
had
convinced
himself
that
he
would
be
afraid
to
play
next
chance
he
had
they
approached
a
crude
merely
a
roadside
saloon
with
a
beer
sign
and
one
lone
rusty
iron
outdoor
table
to
give
an
air
of
i
going
over
there
and
play
said
father
i
wo
have
you
hanging
around
saloons
snapped
mother
now
mother
i
reckon
i
would
more
than
drink
a
couple
of
necks
or
something
wild
like
that
yes
and
that
just
the
way
temptation
gets
you
said
mother
drinking
horses
necks
and
all
them
brandy
drinks
i
wish
i
never
tasted
that
nasty
cocktail
you
made
me
take
last
year
i
wish
i
joined
the
like
tubbs
wanted
me
to
well
we
organize
a
hoboes
chapter
of
the
and
have
meetings
under
the
at
the
depot
they
were
interrupted
by
a
hail
from
the
a
large
man
with
a
detective
mustache
and
a
brewer
cheeks
a
man
in
and
a
white
apron
stood
on
the
porch
calling
hey
and
smith
come
right
in
and
get
warm
father
and
mother
stared
at
each
other
he
means
us
gasped
father
mechanically
the
innocents
straggled
across
the
road
the
shook
hands
with
both
of
them
and
bellowed
lady
telephoned
along
the
line
great
things
for
gossip
these
rural
telephones
said
you
was
coming
this
way
and
we
all
watching
out
for
you
you
come
right
into
the
parlor
no
booze
served
in
there
smith
make
yourselves
comfortable
and
i
have
the
frau
cut
you
up
a
coupla
sandwiches
how
you
leave
san
francisco
pretty
warm
out
there
ai
it
he
had
by
this
time
shooed
them
into
the
plush
and
parlor
behind
the
barroom
his
great
voice
overawed
them
and
they
were
cold
mother
secretively
looked
for
evidences
of
vice
for
a
or
a
blackjack
but
found
nothing
more
sinful
than
a
box
of
dominoes
so
she
perched
on
a
cane
chair
and
folded
her
hands
respectably
how
san
francisco
repeated
the
why
uh
um
uh
how
do
you
mean
father
observed
yes
i
heard
how
you
folks
tramped
from
there
how
is
it
nice
climate
out
there
why
it
pretty
nice
orange
groves
everywhere
nice
climate
said
father
avoiding
mother
accusing
look
and
desperately
hoping
she
would
feel
moved
to
be
veracious
and
virtuous
hey
mamie
here
the
old
couple
that
tramped
clear
from
san
francisco
bawled
the
a
maternal
german
woman
with
a
white
apron
of
about
the
proportions
of
a
cup
defender
mainsail
billowed
into
the
room
exclaimed
over
mother
wet
feet
provided
dry
stockings
and
felt
slippers
for
her
and
insisted
on
stuffing
both
of
them
with
fried
eggs
and
potato
salad
the
and
a
select
coterie
of
farmers
asked
father
questions
about
san
francisco
kansas
rainy
seasons
the
disease
irrigation
western
movie
studios
and
the
extent
of
mormonism
father
stuck
pretty
closely
to
a
description
of
the
exposition
for
answers
to
everything
and
satisfied
all
hands
to
such
an
extent
that
they
humbly
asked
him
how
much
danger
there
was
of
a
japanese
invasion
of
the
philippines
and
how
long
did
he
think
the
great
european
war
would
last
abashed
prickly
with
uncomfortableness
father
discovered
that
the
was
taking
up
a
collection
for
them
it
was
done
very
quietly
and
the
man
slipped
a
dollar
and
fifteen
cents
into
his
hand
in
so
casual
a
manner
so
much
as
though
he
were
merely
making
change
that
father
took
it
and
uneasily
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
he
understood
the
kindly
spirit
of
it
because
he
himself
was
kindly
he
realized
that
to
these
the
applebys
wandering
was
a
thing
to
revere
a
heroism
like
or
religion
or
going
to
war
but
he
psychologize
about
it
he
believed
in
the
masses
because
he
belonged
to
the
masses
as
a
matter
of
fact
father
had
very
little
time
to
devote
to
meditation
when
they
hit
the
road
again
he
was
busy
defending
himself
while
mother
accused
him
of
having
lied
scandalously
he
protested
that
he
had
never
said
that
he
had
been
to
san
francisco
they
had
made
that
mistake
themselves
now
do
you
go
trying
to
throw
dust
in
my
eyes
i
just
wo
have
this
lying
and
prevaricating
and
i
just
going
to
the
matter
seth
you
limping
are
your
feet
cold
and
that
was
the
end
of
mother
moral
injunctions
for
father
with
a
most
unworthy
cunning
featured
the
coldness
of
his
feet
till
she
had
exhausted
her
vocabulary
of
chiropodal
sympathy
after
which
he
kept
her
interested
in
the
state
of
his
ears
his
hands
and
the
tip
of
his
nose
she
patted
him
consolingly
and
they
toiled
on
together
forgetting
in
the
closeness
of
their
comradeship
the
strangeness
of
being
on
an
unknown
road
homeless
as
a
chilly
sunset
spread
bands
of
cold
lemon
and
gray
across
the
enormous
sky
and
all
decent
folk
thought
of
supper
then
everything
went
wrong
with
the
wandering
innocents
about
father
made
another
attempt
to
get
himself
to
play
the
at
a
mean
which
came
in
sight
after
a
lonely
stretch
mother
was
sinking
with
weariness
he
hitched
the
out
of
its
case
but
again
he
shrank
and
he
feebly
said
to
a
farmer
in
overalls
can
i
split
some
wood
for
you
smith
and
i
are
tramping
the
farmer
ungenerously
took
him
at
his
word
for
an
hour
he
kept
father
hacking
at
a
pile
of
wood
while
mother
crouched
near
trying
to
keep
warm
with
his
coat
over
her
feet
father
back
turned
into
one
broad
ache
and
his
arms
stung
but
he
stuck
to
it
till
the
farmer
growled
i
guess
that
do
now
do
hang
around
here
he
handed
father
a
bundle
father
thought
of
throwing
it
at
him
but
simultaneously
he
thought
of
keeping
it
and
consuming
its
contents
he
gasped
with
the
insult
he
became
angrier
and
angrier
as
he
realized
that
the
insult
applied
to
mother
also
but
before
he
could
think
of
a
smart
crushing
reply
the
farmer
grumped
away
into
the
house
the
applebys
dragged
themselves
back
to
the
highroad
father
was
blaming
himself
for
having
brought
her
to
this
but
i
did
try
to
get
a
job
first
he
insisted
and
remembered
how
he
had
once
begged
the
owner
of
a
filthy
on
third
avenue
for
a
place
as
porter
shoeblack
anything
their
road
led
them
by
a
clump
of
woods
we
have
a
fire
here
and
camp
cried
father
he
had
never
made
a
fire
in
the
open
and
he
understood
it
to
be
a
most
difficult
process
but
he
was
a
young
lover
his
sweetheart
was
cold
he
defied
man
and
nature
disdaining
any
possible
he
plunged
into
the
woodland
with
bare
hands
he
scooped
the
light
fall
of
snow
from
between
two
rocks
and
in
the
darkness
fumbled
for
twigs
and
leaves
gruntingly
he
dragged
larger
boughs
piled
the
wood
with
infinite
care
lighted
it
tremblingly
they
sat
on
the
rocks
by
the
fire
and
opened
the
farmer
bundle
there
were
cold
gristly
roast
beef
bread
and
cheese
and
a
large
sausage
um
meditated
father
then
i
heat
up
the
roast
beef
which
he
grandly
did
on
little
sticks
and
they
ate
it
contemplatively
while
their
souls
and
toes
relaxed
in
the
warmth
and
the
black
shone
cozily
in
the
glow
no
cockroaches
and
no
smell
of
fried
fish
here
like
there
is
on
avenue
b
said
father
and
we
do
have
to
go
home
from
our
picnic
i
wonder
why
folks
let
themselves
get
all
old
and
when
they
could
be
like
us
yes
said
mother
drowsily
he
had
nerved
himself
to
play
the
not
all
day
but
now
with
the
luxury
of
fire
and
solitude
he
played
it
and
what
more
he
tried
to
whistle
a
natty
little
ballad
which
touchingly
presented
a
castaway
as
for
his
michigan
his
yet
father
was
altogether
satisfied
with
his
fire
the
dry
twigs
he
kept
feeding
to
it
flared
up
and
were
gone
the
innocents
huddled
together
closer
and
closer
to
the
coals
father
gave
little
pats
to
her
shoulder
while
she
shivered
and
began
to
look
anxious
cold
old
honey
yes
but
it
do
matter
she
declared
come
on
i
guess
we
better
go
look
for
a
place
to
sleep
afraid
do
know
as
i
could
keep
this
fire
up
all
night
after
all
oh
i
ca
walk
any
oh
i
guess
it
will
be
all
right
when
i
get
going
again
she
tried
to
smile
at
him
and
with
the
slowness
of
pain
she
reached
for
her
bundle
he
snatched
it
from
her
i
can
carry
all
our
stuff
anyway
he
said
leaning
on
him
moving
step
by
step
every
step
an
agony
of
soreness
and
cold
lifting
her
feet
each
time
by
a
separate
effort
of
her
numbed
will
she
plodded
beside
him
while
he
tried
to
aid
her
with
a
hand
under
her
elbow
there
there
where
we
go
he
whispered
as
the
shapes
of
lifted
against
the
sky
we
wo
ask
permission
we
might
get
it
like
that
last
farmer
and
i
wo
let
you
go
one
step
farther
we
butt
right
into
the
barn
and
sleep
in
the
hay
but
do
you
think
we
better
we
will
the
father
was
a
very
lion
emboldened
by
his
care
for
her
he
would
have
faced
ten
farmers
terrible
with
without
one
timorous
glance
he
led
her
to
the
small
of
the
barn
eased
down
the
latch
lifted
her
over
the
sill
closed
the
door
in
the
barn
was
a
great
blackness
but
also
a
great
content
it
seemed
warm
and
was
intimate
with
the
scent
of
cows
and
hay
alive
with
the
quiet
breathing
of
animals
father
lit
a
match
and
located
the
stairs
to
the
haymow
mother
was
staggering
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
very
tender
and
reverent
he
guided
her
to
the
stairs
and
up
them
step
by
agonized
step
to
the
fragrant
peace
of
the
haymow
she
sank
down
and
he
covered
her
so
deep
with
hay
that
only
her
face
was
left
uncovered
warm
mother
she
did
not
answer
she
was
already
asleep
through
a
night
haunted
by
vague
monsters
of
darkness
and
by
sneezes
whenever
spears
of
hay
invaded
his
indignant
city
nose
father
turned
and
thrashed
but
he
was
warm
and
he
did
sleep
for
hours
at
a
time
at
what
must
have
been
dawn
he
heard
the
farmer
at
the
stalls
in
the
stable
below
he
felt
refreshed
cozily
drowsy
and
he
did
a
shameless
thing
a
trick
of
vagrants
and
he
put
his
thumb
to
his
nose
aimed
his
hand
toward
the
supposititious
location
of
the
farmer
below
and
twirled
his
outspread
fingers
in
a
flickering
manner
it
is
believed
that
he
intended
to
convey
spirited
defiance
or
possibly
insult
by
this
amazing
gesture
he
grinned
contentedly
and
went
to
sleep
again
fortunately
mother
was
asleep
and
did
not
see
him
acting
as
she
often
but
vainly
defined
it
like
a
young
smart
aleck
father
awakened
from
an
agitating
dream
of
setting
the
barn
afire
and
beheld
mother
sitting
up
amid
the
hay
an
amazing
a
quite
incredible
situation
for
seth
appleby
she
mildly
dabbled
at
her
gray
hair
which
was
still
neat
and
looked
across
in
bewilderment
like
a
father
came
up
out
of
the
hay
to
greet
her
how
do
you
like
your
room
in
the
he
said
sleep
well
old
honey
why
why
i
must
have
she
marveled
i
do
hardly
remember
coming
here
though
ready
to
tramp
on
she
swore
that
she
was
and
indeed
her
cheeks
were
ruddy
with
outdoors
the
corners
of
her
eyes
relaxed
but
she
was
so
stiff
that
they
had
hobbled
a
mile
and
father
had
shucked
several
tons
of
corn
in
return
for
breakfast
before
she
ceased
feeling
as
though
her
legs
were
made
of
extraordinarily
brittle
glass
chapter
xiv
sometimes
they
were
f√™ted
adventurers
who
were
credited
with
having
tramped
over
most
of
the
globe
sometimes
they
were
hoboes
on
whom
straggly
women
shut
doors
but
never
were
they
wandering
minstrels
father
went
on
believing
that
he
intended
to
play
the
and
entertain
the
poor
but
actually
he
depended
on
his
arm
and
every
cord
he
chopped
gave
him
a
ruddier
flush
of
youth
a
warmer
flush
of
ambition
most
people
do
not
know
why
they
do
things
not
even
you
and
i
invariably
know
though
of
course
we
are
superior
to
the
unresponsive
masses
many
people
are
even
unconscious
that
they
are
doing
things
or
being
things
being
gentle
or
cruel
or
creative
or
parasitic
quite
without
knowing
it
father
was
searching
for
his
place
in
the
world
the
new
york
had
decided
that
he
was
too
old
to
be
useful
but
age
is
as
fictitious
as
time
or
love
father
was
awakening
from
the
sleep
of
drudgery
in
the
one
dusty
shop
and
he
was
asking
what
other
place
there
was
for
him
he
was
beginning
to
have
another
idea
a
better
idea
which
he
pondered
as
he
came
to
in
small
towns
they
were
very
well
the
signs
were
feeble
maybe
some
day
he
get
back
into
the
shoe
business
in
some
town
and
show
them
only
how
could
he
talk
business
to
a
shoeman
when
he
was
shabby
and
and
none
too
extravagant
in
the
care
of
his
reddening
hands
but
he
was
learning
something
more
weighty
the
art
of
handling
people
in
the
two
aspects
thereof
bluffing
and
backing
up
the
bluff
with
force
and
originality
he
came
to
the
commonplace
people
along
the
road
as
something
novel
and
admirable
a
man
who
had
taken
his
wife
and
his
poverty
and
gone
seeing
the
world
when
he
smiled
in
a
superior
way
and
said
nothing
people
immediately
believed
that
he
must
have
been
places
done
brave
things
he
did
so
much
bluff
them
as
let
them
bluff
themselves
he
had
never
been
able
to
do
that
in
his
years
as
a
shadow
to
the
late
pilkings
it
is
earnestly
recommended
to
all
uncomfortable
or
dissatisfied
men
over
sixty
that
they
take
their
wives
and
their
and
go
tramping
in
winter
whether
they
be
bank
presidents
or
or
writers
of
fiction
or
just
plain
honest
men
though
doubtless
some
of
them
may
have
difficulty
in
getting
their
wives
to
go
it
was
early
march
a
snowy
blustery
march
and
the
applebys
were
plodding
through
west
virginia
no
longer
were
they
the
mysterious
smiths
father
was
rather
proud
now
of
being
appleby
the
pedestrian
mother
looked
stolidly
content
as
she
trudged
at
his
side
ruddy
and
placid
and
accustomed
to
being
wept
over
by
every
at
an
early
dusk
with
a
storm
menacing
with
the
air
uneasy
and
a
wind
melancholy
in
the
trees
they
struck
off
by
a
forest
road
which
would
they
hoped
prove
a
short
cut
to
the
town
of
weatherford
they
came
to
and
took
the
more
trodden
way
which
betrayed
them
and
soon
dwindled
to
a
narrow
rut
which
they
could
scarcely
follow
in
the
twilight
father
was
frightened
they
would
have
to
camp
in
the
woods
and
a
blizzard
was
coming
he
saw
a
light
ahead
a
shifting
evasive
light
there
a
or
something
he
declared
cheerily
we
just
make
give
us
shelter
going
to
storm
too
bad
to
do
much
work
for
and
i
bet
it
some
cranky
old
shellback
farmer
living
out
here
like
this
well
we
teach
the
old
codger
to
like
music
and
this
time
i
play
my
ai
you
glad
we
young
folks
that
like
music
and
dancing
how
you
run
on
mother
said
trustingly
from
the
bleakness
ahead
came
a
cracked
but
lusty
voice
singing
hello
man
singing
jolly
that
a
good
omen
chuckled
father
all
the
folks
that
are
peculiar
like
we
are
love
to
sing
yes
and
talk
however
much
she
enjoyed
father
chatter
mother
felt
that
she
owed
it
to
her
conscience
which
she
kept
as
neat
and
well
dusted
now
that
they
were
vagrants
as
she
had
in
a
new
york
flat
to
reprove
him
occasionally
for
his
own
good
say
this
is
exciting
that
a
bonfire
ahead
father
whispered
they
slowed
their
pace
to
a
stealthy
walk
behind
them
and
beside
them
was
chilly
darkness
lurking
in
caverns
among
black
bare
before
them
they
could
see
a
nebulous
glow
and
hear
the
monotonous
voice
singing
the
same
words
over
and
over
mother
shrieked
they
stopped
a
vast
lumbering
bulk
of
a
man
plunged
out
from
the
woods
hesitated
stooped
brandished
a
club
tut
tut
no
need
to
be
excited
mister
we
just
two
old
folks
looking
for
shelter
for
the
night
wavered
father
with
spurious
coolness
huh
growled
a
thick
greasy
voice
where
belong
everywhere
we
tramping
to
san
francisco
as
he
said
it
father
stood
uneasy
looking
into
the
penetrating
eye
of
an
electric
torch
which
the
man
had
flashed
on
him
the
torch
blotted
out
the
man
who
held
it
and
turned
everything
the
night
the
woods
the
storm
mutters
into
just
that
one
hypnotizing
ball
of
fire
suspended
in
the
darkness
well
well
gasped
the
unknown
a
moll
swelp
me
welcome
to
our
roost
you
hit
it
right
this
is
hoboes
home
there
nine
of
us
got
a
shack
up
ahead
welcome
what
your
line
con
game
or
just
busted
i
sure
i
do
know
what
you
mean
young
man
snapped
mother
well
if
you
two
are
like
me
nothing
but
just
honest
workmen
you
better
try
and
make
think
you
working
some
game
tell
the
queen
of
the
or
some
dern
thing
like
that
come
on
now
been
gathering
wood
got
enough
you
can
follow
me
the
bunch
so
very
criminal
not
for
hoboes
they
ai
the
large
mysterious
man
started
down
the
path
toward
the
glow
and
father
and
mother
followed
him
uncomfortably
it
a
den
of
vice
he
taking
us
into
groaned
father
and
if
we
go
back
they
pursue
us
maybe
we
better
i
do
believe
a
con
game
is
a
nice
thing
whatever
it
is
said
mother
it
sounds
real
wicked
i
never
heard
of
how
do
you
rig
a
thimble
i
do
know
but
i
think
we
better
go
back
they
stopped
the
large
man
turned
on
them
and
growled
hustle
up
obediently
the
innocents
trailed
after
his
dark
shaggy
back
that
in
his
tattered
overcoat
seemed
as
formidable
as
it
was
big
the
glow
grew
more
intense
ahead
of
them
they
came
into
a
clearing
where
round
a
fire
beside
a
rude
shanty
sat
several
men
one
of
whom
was
still
droning
hello
visitors
shouted
the
guide
the
group
sprang
up
startled
threatening
shabby
men
father
stood
palsied
as
grim
unshaven
faces
lowered
at
him
as
a
sinister
man
with
a
hooked
nose
stalked
forward
his
fist
doubled
but
mother
left
his
side
darted
past
the
man
and
snapped
that
no
way
to
peel
potatoes
young
man
you
losing
all
the
best
part
next
to
the
skin
here
give
me
that
i
show
you
waste
and
carelessness
while
father
and
the
group
of
circled
hoboes
stared
mother
firmly
took
a
huge
away
from
a
slight
man
who
was
peeling
potatoes
and
chucking
them
into
a
pot
of
stew
that
was
boiling
on
the
fire
well
i
be
darned
said
every
one
almost
in
chorus
who
are
you
the
man
demanded
of
father
but
his
voice
sounded
puzzled
and
he
gazed
incredulously
at
mother
as
she
cozily
peeled
potatoes
her
delicate
cheeks
and
placid
eye
revealed
in
the
firelight
she
was
already
as
sturdily
industrious
and
as
though
she
were
back
in
the
i
appleby
the
pedestrian
said
father
wife
and
i
went
say
ai
she
the
woman
in
that
firelight
great
woman
let
me
tell
you
we
went
broke
in
new
york
and
we
tramping
to
can
you
take
us
in
for
the
night
i
guess
we
all
sure
will
said
the
man
pleased
to
have
you
come
my
name
crook
mckusick
i
kind
of
camp
boss
the
boys
call
me
because
i
so
honest
you
can
see
that
yourself
oh
yes
said
father
quite
innocently
the
lad
that
the
madam
dispossessed
is
reddy
and
this
duck
here
is
the
kid
but
i
guess
the
most
important
guy
in
the
gang
is
mulligan
the
stew
if
your
missus
wants
to
elect
herself
cook
and
make
the
mulligan
taste
human
she
can
be
the
boss
bring
me
the
salt
and
do
talk
so
much
you
have
the
stew
spoiled
in
about
one
minute
mother
said
severely
to
crook
mckusick
and
that
mighty
leader
meekly
said
yes
and
trotted
to
a
box
on
the
far
side
of
the
fire
the
rest
of
the
band
eight
practical
romanticists
each
of
whom
was
in
some
ways
tougher
than
the
others
looked
rather
sullenly
at
restraining
presence
but
when
the
mulligan
was
served
they
volunteered
awkward
compliments
veal
and
chicken
and
sweet
potatoes
and
irish
potatoes
and
carrots
and
corn
were
in
the
stew
and
it
was
very
hot
and
there
was
powerful
coffee
with
condensed
milk
to
accompany
it
father
shook
his
head
and
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
really
was
where
he
was
in
a
rim
of
bare
woods
reddened
with
firelight
surrounding
a
little
stumpy
clearing
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
shack
covered
with
fastened
with
laths
the
fire
hid
the
storm
behind
its
warm
curtain
the
ruffians
about
the
fire
seemed
to
be
customers
in
a
new
t
room
as
mother
fussed
over
them
and
kept
their
plates
filled
gradually
the
hoboes
thawed
out
and
told
the
applebys
that
they
had
permission
from
the
owner
of
the
land
to
occupy
this
winter
refuge
but
that
they
liberally
swiped
their
supplies
from
the
whole
countryside
mother
exclaimed
you
poor
boys
i
do
suppose
you
know
any
better
father
i
think
we
stay
here
for
a
few
days
and
i
mend
up
the
boys
clothes
and
teach
them
not
to
steal
you
boys
why
here
you
are
great
big
men
and
you
can
jus
as
well
go
out
every
day
and
work
enough
to
get
your
supplies
no
need
to
be
leading
an
immoral
life
jus
because
you
tramps
i
do
see
but
what
being
tramps
is
real
interesting
and
healthy
if
you
jus
go
about
it
in
a
nice
moral
way
now
you
with
the
red
hair
come
here
and
wipe
the
dishes
while
i
wash
them
i
swear
to
goodness
i
do
believe
these
horrid
tin
plates
have
been
washed
since
you
got
them
as
mother
bland
determined
oration
ended
crook
mckusick
the
leader
glanced
at
her
with
a
resigned
shrug
and
growled
all
right
anything
for
a
change
as
the
fellow
said
to
the
ragged
shirt
we
start
a
i
suppose
you
be
having
us
take
baths
next
the
youngster
introduced
as
the
kid
piped
up
truculently
say
where
do
you
get
this
moral
stuff
this
ai
a
picnic
it
a
hoboes
camp
crook
mckusick
vaulted
up
with
startling
quickness
seized
the
kid
by
the
neck
wrenched
his
face
around
and
demanded
can
that
stuff
kid
if
you
do
like
the
new
stunt
you
can
beat
it
this
here
lady
has
got
more
nerve
than
ten
transcontinental
bums
put
together
woman
lady
like
her
out
battering
for
eats
and
pounding
the
roads
she
the
new
boss
see
but
old
uncle
crook
is
here
with
his
mits
too
see
the
kid
winced
as
crook
nails
gouged
his
neck
and
whimpered
all
right
crook
gee
you
do
need
to
get
so
sore
about
it
unconscious
that
there
had
been
a
crisis
mother
struck
in
step
lively
now
boys
and
we
clean
the
dishes
while
the
water
hot
with
the
incredulous
gentry
of
leisure
obeying
her
commands
mother
scoured
the
dishes
picked
up
refuse
then
penetrated
the
and
was
appalled
by
the
filth
on
the
floor
and
by
the
mattresses
thrown
in
the
crude
wooden
bunks
now
we
tidy
this
up
she
said
and
maybe
i
can
fix
up
a
corner
for
appleby
and
me
sort
of
partition
it
off
like
the
usual
evening
meditations
and
geographical
discussions
of
the
monastery
of
hoboes
had
been
interrupted
by
collecting
garbage
and
by
a
quite
useless
cleaning
of
dishes
that
would
only
get
dirty
again
they
were
recuperating
returning
to
their
spiritual
plane
of
perfect
peace
in
picturesque
attitudes
by
the
fire
they
scowled
now
again
the
kid
raised
his
voice
aw
let
the
alone
what
think
this
is
a
female
cemetery
crook
mckusick
glared
but
reddy
joined
the
rebellion
with
through
i
ai
no
chink
laundryman
the
bunch
turned
their
heads
away
from
mother
and
pretended
to
ignore
her
and
to
ignore
crook
swaying
shoulders
and
clenching
fists
in
low
but
most
voices
they
began
to
curse
the
surprised
and
unhappy
mother
father
ranged
up
beside
her
protectingly
he
was
sure
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
and
he
determined
to
do
for
some
one
anyway
he
was
trapped
desperate
crook
mckusick
stood
with
them
too
but
his
glance
wavered
from
them
to
the
group
at
the
fire
and
back
again
and
he
was
clearing
his
throat
to
speak
when
hands
up
came
a
voice
from
the
shadows
beyond
the
fire
chapter
xv
while
he
was
raising
his
arms
so
high
that
his
cuffs
were
pulled
down
to
his
elbows
father
was
conscious
that
the
hoboes
by
the
fire
even
the
formidable
crook
mckusick
were
doing
the
same
facing
them
in
the
woods
border
was
a
farmer
in
a
overcoat
aiming
a
beside
him
two
other
farmers
with
rifles
under
their
arms
it
seemed
to
father
that
he
was
in
a
wild
western
melodrama
and
he
helplessly
muttered
gosh
can
you
beat
it
the
man
with
the
leveled
drawled
i
the
deputy
sheriff
for
this
locality
and
i
give
you
dirty
bums
just
five
minutes
to
pick
up
your
duffle
and
git
out
and
keep
i
guess
we
do
need
you
around
here
you
been
robbing
every
for
ten
miles
now
step
lively
and
no
funny
business
stung
muttered
crook
mckusick
hopelessly
got
us
suddenly
a
downy
figure
who
might
herself
have
come
from
a
large
peaceful
human
fluttered
straight
at
the
muzzle
of
the
sheriff
it
was
mother
hands
up
i
told
juh
stormed
the
sheriff
amazedly
oh
look
mother
wailed
father
rushing
after
her
his
own
hands
going
down
to
his
sides
in
his
agitation
look
out
aunty
echoed
crook
mckusick
that
a
bad
actor
that
guy
but
mother
continued
straight
at
the
gun
snapping
do
point
that
dratted
thing
at
me
you
bother
me
the
sheriff
wavered
the
gun
dropped
who
are
you
he
demanded
never
you
mind
who
i
am
young
man
i
responsible
for
these
boys
though
and
they
promised
me
they
would
do
no
more
stealing
going
to
work
for
what
they
get
and
they
got
a
right
here
on
this
land
they
got
permission
that
more
than
you
got
i
venture
with
your
nasty
guns
and
all
coming
around
here
have
you
got
a
warrant
no
i
ai
but
you
then
you
just
step
yourself
away
young
man
coming
here
fairly
shaking
a
body
nerves
i
vow
you
almost
scare
me
carrying
on
put
down
that
dratted
gun
i
told
you
you
either
go
deputy
monkey
or
i
see
your
boss
and
we
see
what
we
see
with
which
mother
who
was
rapidly
becoming
almost
impolite
in
her
indignation
over
this
uninvited
visit
from
a
person
whom
she
find
it
in
her
heart
to
like
seized
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
pushed
it
down
and
stood
glowering
at
the
sheriff
her
arms
akimbo
well
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
if
you
got
any
idee
that
this
bunch
of
is
likely
to
turn
into
any
party
now
none
of
your
nonsense
and
impudence
and
sneering
young
man
and
be
off
with
you
or
i
see
somebody
that
have
something
to
say
to
you
illegal
that
what
they
are
no
warrant
or
nothing
one
of
the
sheriff
companions
muttered
come
on
bill
i
think
the
wife
of
that
nosey
new
preacher
over
to
cordova
all
right
said
the
sheriff
before
he
turned
away
he
threatened
now
if
i
hear
of
anything
more
from
you
boys
i
get
that
warrant
all
righty
and
you
land
in
the
calaboose
where
you
belong
but
the
hoboes
about
the
fire
cheered
derisively
and
as
the
sheriff
disappeared
in
the
woods
they
surrounded
mother
in
a
circle
of
grins
and
shining
eyes
and
the
kid
was
the
first
to
declare
good
for
you
aunty
you
elected
camp
boss
and
you
can
make
me
cookee
if
you
want
to
well
then
said
mother
calmly
let
get
that
nasty
shack
cleaned
up
right
away
i
do
declare
i
beginning
to
get
sleepy
nothing
in
his
life
was
more
to
father
credit
than
the
fact
that
he
did
not
envy
mother
the
credit
of
having
become
monarch
of
the
camp
and
protector
of
the
poor
i
with
you
mother
he
said
what
you
want
me
to
do
let
hustle
blizzard
coming
with
a
warrant
round
a
in
the
woods
a
group
of
men
were
playing
cards
men
in
rough
coats
and
greasy
flannel
shirts
but
the
most
violent
thing
they
said
was
doggone
it
and
sometimes
they
stopped
to
listen
to
the
strains
of
dandy
dick
and
the
candlestick
which
a
cheerful
old
gentleman
rendered
on
the
father
was
perched
on
a
his
feet
were
turned
inward
with
comfort
and
and
now
and
then
he
jerked
his
head
sideways
with
an
air
of
virile
satisfaction
the
collar
of
his
shirt
poked
up
beside
his
chin
as
cockily
as
the
ear
of
a
setter
pup
father
did
know
it
but
he
was
making
believe
be
king
of
the
bandits
across
the
fire
in
an
aged
and
uncertain
placid
as
though
she
were
sitting
beside
a
instead
of
a
with
winter
woods
was
mother
darning
a
sock
and
lecturing
the
crook
mckusick
on
cursing
and
swearing
and
crook
stared
down
at
her
adoringly
and
just
when
she
seemed
to
have
penetrated
his
tough
hide
with
her
moral
injunctions
he
chuckled
by
golly
i
believe
i
marry
and
settle
down
just
as
soon
as
i
can
find
a
moll
that
turn
into
a
cute
old
lady
like
you
aunty
now
mckusick
she
said
severely
you
want
to
reform
for
the
sake
of
reforming
not
just
to
please
some
girl
not
but
what
a
nice
sweet
woman
would
be
good
nothing
will
ever
be
good
for
me
aunty
i
gone

sweet
civilization
of
ours

got
me
the
first
reform

went
to

me
into
a
crook

used
to
show
signs
of
growing
up
to
be
fair

middling
intelligent

but
now

though

as
young

a
chance

famous
old
pedestrians

at
my
time

life
learning
to

and
bending
and
flapping
my
arms
like
a
chicken
with
its
head
cut
off
but
father
enthusiastically
and
immediately
started
in
to
become
the
rival
of
the
gentlemen
in
jerseys
who
wear
rubber
heels
in
the
advertisements
and
spend
their
old
ages
in
vigorously
walking
from
the
atlantic
coast
to
the
pacific
merely
in
order
to
walk
back
again
while
his
about
the
fire
jeered
father
bent
over
forty
times
and
raised
himself
on
his
toes
sixty
and
solemnly
took
next
day
he
slowly
trotted
ninety
times
about
the
clearing
his
chin
up
and
his
chest
out
while
crook
mckusick
excited
at
being
a
trainer
again
snapped
orders
at
him
and
talked
about
form
a
ludicrous
figure
a
little
old
man
his
white
locks
flapping
under
a
mushy
cap
as
he
galloped
earnestly
through
the
light
snow
but
his
cheeks
were
one
red
glow
his
eyes
were
bright
and
in
his
laugh
when
he
finished
was
infinite
hope
if
it
had
been
mother
who
had
first
taken
charge
of
the
camp
and
converted
it
to
respectability
and
digestible
food
it
was
father
who
really
ran
it
for
he
was
the
only
person
who
could
understand
her
and
crook
mckusick
and
the
sloppy
kid
all
at
once
crook
mckusick
had
long
cultivated
a
careful
habit
of
getting
drunk
once
a
week
but
two
weeks
after
the
coming
of
the
applebys
he
began
to
omit
his
sprees
because
mother
needed
him
to
help
her
engineer
variations
of
the
perpetual
mulligan
and
father
needed
him
for
his
regular
training
to
the
training
crook
added
a
course
in
psychology
as
a
hobo
he
was
learned
in
that
science
the
little
clerk
the
comfortable
banker
the
writer
of
such
dull
plodders
have
their
habits
all
set
out
for
them
but
the
hobo
who
has
to
ride
the
rods
amid
flying
gravel
and
has
to
coax
food
out
of
a
nice
old
lady
must
have
an
expert
working
knowledge
of
psychology
if
he
is
to
climb
in
his
arduous
profession
father
and
mother
had
started
out
from
new
york
on
a
desperate
flight
with
no
aspirations
beyond
the
hope
that
they
might
be
able
to
make
a
living
it
was
the
hobo
crook
mckusick
who
taught
father
that
there
was
no
reason
why
with
his
outdoor
life
and
his
broadened
experience
he
should
not
be
a
leader
among
men
wherever
he
went
be
an
edward
pilkings
and
a
miss
mitchin
yea
even
a
lulu
hartwig
instead
of
a
meek
obedient
little
seth
appleby
it
was
crook
who
out
of
his
own
experience
in
doing
the
unusual
taught
father
that
it
was
just
as
easy
to
be
unusual
to
live
a
life
excitedly
free
as
to
be
a
clerk
adventure
like
fear
of
adventure
consisted
in
going
one
step
at
a
time
keeping
at
it
forming
the
habit
so
an
outcast
among
outcasts
grubbily
bunked
in
a
camp
of
hoboes
talking
to
a
filthy
lean
man
with
an
evil
hooked
nose
seth
appleby
began
to
think
for
himself
to
the
end
that
he
should
be
one
of
the
class
that
rules
and
is
unafraid
the
amiable
boarders
at
hoboes
home
did
at
all
mind
mother
darning
their
socks
they
did
much
mind
having
her
order
them
to
wash
their
faces
at
a
hole
through
the
ice
in
the
creek
before
coming
to
dinner
but
it
took
her
many
days
to
get
them
used
to
going
off
to
work
for
money
and
supplies
yet
every
day
half
the
camp
grumblingly
disappeared
to
shuck
corn
mend
fences
repair
machinery
and
they
came
back
with
flour
potatoes
meat
coffee
torn
magazines
and
shirts
father
regularly
went
out
to
work
with
them
and
was
the
first
to
bring
water
to
cut
wood
they
all
took
a
pride
in
the
camp
they
kept
the
scrubbed
and
inordinately
admired
the
new
mattresses
stuffed
with
fresh
straw
and
covered
with
new
calico
which
mother
made
for
them
in
the
evenings
the
group
about
the
was
not
so
very
different
from
any
other
happy
family
except
that
there
was
an
unusually
large
proportion
of
bright
eyes
and
tanned
faces
but
when
spring
cleared
the
snow
away
made
the
bare
patches
of
earth
quiver
with
coming
life
sent
the
crows
and
an
occasional
flock
of
ducks
overhead
vagrants
of
the
air
calling
to
their
vagrant
brothers
about
the
fire
there
was
no
sorrow
in
the
of
the
family
but
only
a
universal
joy
in
starting
off
for
new
adventures
that
honest
workman
struck
dumb
disappeared
one
afternoon
telling
crook
that
he
heard
of
much
building
at
duluth
crook
laughed
when
mother
admired
mr
struck
dumb
yearning
for
creative
toil
that
guy
crook
declared
is
an
honest
workman
except
that
he
ai
honest
and
he
wo
work
he
last
about
two
days
in
duluth
and
then
he
pike
for
alberta
or
san
diego
or
some
place
got
restless
feet
same
like
me
the
kid
and
reddy
jigged
and
shouted
songs
all
one
evening
and
were
off
for
the
north
at
last
no
one
but
father
and
mother
and
crook
was
left
and
they
too
were
with
expectation
of
new
roads
new
hills
they
sat
solemnly
by
the
fire
on
their
last
evening
mother
was
magnificent
in
a
new
cloak
to
buy
which
father
had
secretly
been
saving
pennies
out
of
the
dimes
that
he
had
earned
by
working
about
the
country
usually
crook
mckusick
was
gravely
cynical
when
he
listened
to
cataract
of
excited
plans
but
he
seemed
wistful
and
he
nodded
his
head
as
though
for
once
he
really
did
believe
that
father
and
mother
would
find
some
friendly
village
that
would
take
them
in
father
was
telling
a
story
so
ardently
that
he
almost
made
himself
believe
it
some
day
mother
and
he
would
be
crawling
along
the
road
and
discover
a
great
estate
the
owner
a
whimsical
man
a
lonely
and
eccentric
bachelor
of
the
type
that
always
brightens
english
novels
would
invite
them
in
make
father
his
steward
and
mother
his
lady
housekeeper
there
would
be
a
mystery
in
the
house
a
room
a
sound
of
voices
at
night
in
dark
corridors
where
no
voices
could
possibly
be
a
hidden
tragedy
and
at
last
father
and
mother
would
lift
the
burden
from
the
place
and
end
their
days
in
the
not
that
father
was
sure
just
what
a
was
but
he
was
quite
definite
and
positive
about
the
how
you
run
on
mother
yawned
aw
let
him
crook
cried
with
sudden
fierceness
my
gawd
you
two
almost
make
me
believe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
faith
left
in
this
dirty
old
world
that
always
seemed
to
me
just
the
back
of
an
eternal
saloon
maybe
maybe
i
find
my
ambition
again
well
g
night
when
with
their
pack
and
their
outlooking
smiles
the
applebys
prepared
to
start
next
day
and
turned
to
say
to
crook
he
started
cried
i
will
and
added
i
coming
with
you
for
a
while
for
two
days
crook
mckusick
tramped
with
them
suiting
his
lean
activity
his
sardonic
impatience
to
their
leisurely
slowness
he
called
to
the
blackbirds
he
found
for
them
and
in
the
hollows
between
hillocks
coaxed
them
to
lie
and
dream
but
one
morning
they
found
a
note
dear
aunty
and
uncle
heard
a
whistle
and
i
off
but
some
day
find
you
again
i
cut
out
the
booze
anyway
and
maybe
be
a
human
being
again
god
bless
you
babes
in
the
woods
mck
the
poor
boy
god
will
bless
him
too
and
keep
him
because
opened
his
heart
again
whispered
mother
are
we
babes
in
the
woods
seth
i
rather
be
that
than
a
queen
long
as
i
can
be
with
you
east
and
west
north
and
south
the
hoboes
journeyed
and
everywhere
they
carried
with
them
fables
of
and
seth
appleby
the
famous
wanderers
who
at
seventy
eighty
ninety
were
exploring
the
world
benighted
tramps
in
city
talking
to
bored
police
reporters
told
the
story
and
it
began
to
appear
in
little
filler
paragraphs
here
and
there
in
newspapers
finally
a
on
a
boston
paper
a
man
with
imagination
and
a
sense
of
the
dramatic
made
a
sunday
story
out
of
the
adventures
of
and
appleby
he
represented
them
as
wealthy
who
were
at
once
explorers
and
exponents
of
the
simple
life
he
said
nothing
about
a
a
a
the
idea
of
these
old
people
making
themselves
a
new
life
caught
many
imaginations
the
sunday
story
was
reprinted
and
reprinted
till
the
source
of
it
was
entirely
forgotten
the
names
of
the
applebys
became
stock
references
in
many
newspaper
offices
father
even
had
a
new
joke
appended
to
his
name
as
though
he
were
an
actor
or
an
author
or
chauncey
depew
the
applebys
were
largely
unconscious
of
their
floating
fame
but
as
they
tramped
westward
through
west
virginia
as
the
flood
tide
of
spring
and
the
vigor
of
summer
bore
them
across
ohio
and
into
indiana
they
found
that
in
nearly
every
town
people
knew
their
names
and
were
glad
to
welcome
them
as
guests
instead
of
making
them
work
for
food
when
father
did
insist
on
cutting
wood
or
spading
a
garden
it
was
viewed
as
a
charming
eccentricity
in
him
a
consistent
following
of
the
simple
life
and
they
were
delighted
when
he
was
so
whimsical
as
to
accept
pay
for
his
work
but
he
never
played
the
except
to
mother
chapter
xvi
they
were
in
indiana
now
they
had
saved
up
six
dollars
and
twenty
cents
despite
the
fact
that
father
had
overborne
her
caution
and
made
her
dine
at
a
now
and
then
or
sleep
at
a
hotel
while
he
cheerfully
scavenged
in
the
neighborhood
the
shoes
he
had
bought
in
west
virginia
were
impossible
they
had
been
mended
and
resoled
but
the
new
soles
had
large
concentric
holes
mother
discovered
the
fact
and
decisively
took
the
problem
out
of
his
hands
he
was
going
to
take
that
six
dollars
and
twenty
cents
he
was
and
get
new
shoes
it
was
incredible
luxury
he
left
mother
at
a
he
stood
meditatively
before
the
window
of
a
in
lipsittsville
indiana
lawyer
vanduzen
who
read
the
papers
guessed
who
he
was
and
imparted
the
guess
to
the
loafers
in
front
of
the
regal
drug
store
who
watched
him
respectfully
inside
the
the
proprietor
was
excited
why
he
exclaimed
to
his
assistant
that
must
be
appleby
the
pedestrian
fellow
you
read
so
much
about
the
indianapolis
paper
said
just
this
morning
that
he
was
some
place
in
this
part
of
the
country
you
know
the
fellow
tramped
all
over
europe
and
asia
with
his
wife
and
is
bound
for
san
francisco
now
his
one
lone
clerk
a
youth
with
adenoids
gaped
and
grunted
it
was
incredible
to
him
that
any
one
should
walk
without
having
to
father
was
aware
of
the
general
interest
and
as
he
was
becoming
used
to
his
r√¥le
as
public
character
he
marched
into
the
store
like
the
lord
mayor
of
london
when
he
goes
shopping
in
his
gold
coach
with
three
men
and
a
boy
in
powdered
wigs
carrying
his
train
the
proprietor
bowed
and
ventured
glad
to
see
you
with
us
appleby
it
is
appleby
is
it
growled
father
well
well
tramping
like
yours
is
pretty
hard
on
the
footgear
and
that
a
fact
well
well
believe
me
you
come
to
just
the
right
store
for
sport
shoes
we
got
a
large
line
of
smart
new
horsehide
shoes

me
tut
tut
tut
tut

a
pity
the
way
the
tramping
has
worn
out
yours
fine
shoe
too
i
can
see
that
well
well
well
well
how
it
surely
does
wear
out
the
shoes

long
tramping
peter

pair
of
those
horsehide
shoes

appleby
nice
small

the
shoeman

very
fine
grade
of
shoe
and
very
inexpensive
very
good
for
tramping
yump
they
do
going
to
be
with
us
long
inquired
the
shoeman
after
trying
on
the
shoes
and
cursing
out
peter
the
adenoidic
clerk
in
an
abstracted
hopeless
manner
nope
father
was
wonderfully
bored
and
superior
surely
not
this
seth
appleby
but
a
twin
of
his
a
inferior
twin
had
loafed
in
tompkins
square
and
wavered
through
the
new
york
slums
longing
for
something
to
do
he
did
really
mean
to
be
curt
but
his
chief
business
in
life
was
to
get
his
shoes
and
hurry
back
to
mother
who
was
waiting
for
him
a
mile
from
town
at
a
farm
where
the
lordly
father
had
strung
and
told
stories
for
his
breakfast
the
fascinated
shoeman
hated
to
let
him
go
the
shoeman
knew
few
celebrities
and
a
motor
ride
was
his
wildest
adventure
but
by
the
light
of
a
secret
lamp
in
the
bathroom
when
his
wife
supposed
him
to
have
gone
to
bed
he
breathlessly
read
the
o
the
beyond
and
slew
pirates
with
a
rubber
sponge
and
made
a
turkish
towel
into
a
turban
covered
with
quite
valuable
rubies
and
coldly
defied
all
the
sharks
in
the
bathtub
he
was
an
adventurer
and
he
felt
that
father
appleby
would
understand
his
gallantry
he
continued
the
madam
with
you
yump
say
uh
if
i
may
be
so
bold
and
just
suggest
it
we
be
honored
if
you
and
the
madam
could
take
dinner
at
our
house
and
tell
us
about
your
trip
the
wife
and
me
was
talking
about
it
just
this
morning
the
wife
said
guessed
we
have
to
pike
out
and
do
the
same
thing
hee
hee
and
doc
schergan
fine
bright
man
the
doc
very
able
and
cultured
and
educated
he
crazy
to
meet
you
we
were
talking
about
you
just
this
morning
read
about
your
heading
this
way
in
the
indianapolis
paper
say
he
leaned
forward
and
whispered
after
a
look
at
his
clerk
which
ought
to
have
exterminated
that
unadventurous
youth
say
is
it
true
what
they
say
that
you
doing
this
on
a
bet
well
and
father
thawed
a
little
that
what
they
all
saying
but
confidentially
and
do
let
this
go
any
further
it
is
as
much
as
that
this
is
between
you
and
i
now
oh
yessss
breathed
the
flattered
shoeman
there
your
shoes
appleby
four
dollars
please
thank
you
and
let
me
tell
you
confidentially
you
got
the
best
bargain
in
the
store
i
can
see
with
half
an
eye
you
learned
a
lot
about
shoes
i
suppose
it
only
natural
tramping
and
wearing
them
out
so
fast
and
visiting
the
big
burgs
and
all
huh
ought
to
know
shoes
used
to
be
in
business
pilkings
son
little
old
new
york
me
and
old
pilky
practically
started
the
business
together
as
you
might
say
well
well
well
well
the
shoeman
stared
in
reverent
amazement
then
as
he
could
think
of
nothing
further
to
say
he
justly
observed
well
yump
that
reminds
me
make
that
boy
of
yours
rearrange
that
counter
case
there
those
evening
slippers
simply
lose
all
their
display
value
when
you
stick
those
right
up
ferninst
them
that
way
yes
yes
that
so
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
tip
appleby
that
what
it
is
to
be
trained
in
a
big
burg
but
i
have
to
rearrange
it
myself
that
boy
peter
is
no
good
i
letting
him
go
come
saturday
that
so
said
father
then
authoritatively
peter
my
boy
you
ought
to
try
to
make
good
here
nothing
i
like
better
if
i
had
the
time
than
to
grow
up
in
a
in
a
nice
pretty
village
like
this
yes
that
what
i
told
him
many
the
time
do
you
hear
what
appleby
says
peter
say
appleby
does
this
town
really
strike
you
as
having
the
future
for
the
shoe
business
why
sure
are
you
ever
likely
to
think
about
going
back
into
the
shoe
business
again
some
day
apologetically
you
would
ever
want
to
touch
anything
in
as
small
a
burg
as
this
but
in
a
way
it
kind
of
a
pity
i
was
just
thinking
of
how
the
youngsters
here
would
flock
to
have
you
give
your
expert
advice
as
a
sporting
gentleman
instead
of
hanging
around
that
that
those
confounded
worthless
simpson
boys
try
to
run
father
carefully
put
down
the
bundle
of
his
new
shoes
drew
a
long
breath
then
tried
to
look
bored
again
cautiously
yes
i
thought
some
of
going
back
into
business
i
hate
to
give
up
my
exploring
and
all
but
progress
you
know
hate
to
lay
down
the
burden
of
big
affairs
after
being
right
in
the
midst
of
them
for
so
long
which
was
a
recollection
of
some
editorial
father
had
read
in
a
stray
roadside
newspaper
and
you
must
suppose
i
be
sniffy
about
lipsittsville
no
no
no
indeed
not
at
all
i
must
say
i
do
know
when
i
seen
a
more
pretty
town
and
you
can
imagine
how
many
towns
i
must
have
seen
maples
and
cement
walks
and
nice
houses
and
uh
town
well
who
knows
perhaps
some
day
i
might
come
back
here
and
talk
business
with
you
ha
ha
though
i
would
put
in
one
cent
of
capital
no
sir
not
one
red
cent
all
my
money
is
invested
with
my
you
know
harris
hartwig
the
famous
chemical
works
happen
to
know
um
oh
yes
indeed
harry
sartwig
i
do
know
him
but
of
course
i
heard
of
him
well
i
do
wish
you
think
it
over
some
day
appleby
indeed
i
understand
about
the
capital
if
you
and
me
ever
did
happen
to
come
to
terms
i
try
to
see
my
way
clear
to
giving
you
an
interest
in
the
business
in
return
for
your
city
experience
and
your
expert
knowledge
and
fame
and
so
on
as
an
explorer
not
that
we
outfit
so
many
explorers
here
hee
hee
well
maybe
i
think
it
over
some
day
well
well
maybe
i
see
you
again
before
i
get
out
of
town
i
kind
of
planning
to
stick
around
here
for
a
day
or
two
i
talk
over
the
suggestion
with
appleby
me
i
could
probably
call
off
my
wager
but
she
is
really
the
one
that
you
have
to
convince
she
crazy
for
us
to
hike
out
and
tramp
clear
down
into
mexico
and
central
america
does
mind
bandits
and
revolutions
no
more
than
you
and
i
would
a
mouse
in
his
attempt
to
let
people
bluff
themselves
and
accept
him
as
a
person
to
be
taken
seriously
father
kept
on
trying
to
adhere
to
the
truth
but
certainly
this
last
statement
of
his
was
the
grossest
misrepresentation
of
mother
desires
mother
appleby
with
her
still
unvanquished
preference
for
tea
and
baths
did
not
have
the
slightest
desire
to
encounter
bandits
snakes
deserts
or
cacti
of
any
variety
well
look
appleby
if
you
are
going
to
be
around
you
and
the
madam
come
to
dinner
as
i
was
so
bold
as
to
suggest
awhile
ago
that
would
give
us
a
chance
to
discuss
things
aside
from
any
future
business
dicker
between
you
and
me
personally
i
like
to
show
you
just
why
lipsittsville
is
going
to
be
a
bigger
town
than
freiburg
or
taormina
or
hongkong
or
bryan
or
any
of
the
other
towns
in
the
county
let
say
what
they
like
or
could
you
come
to
supper
then
we
could
let
the
ladies
gossip
and
i
have
doc
schergan
come
in
and
maybe
him
and
me
between
us
could
persuade
you
to
think
of
taking
a
partnership
with
me
would
cost
you
a
cent
of
capital
neither
why
the
doc
was
saying
just
this
morning
when
we
was
speaking
of
having
read
about
you
in
the
paper
he
was
saying
that
you
were
the
kind
of
man
we
need
for
president
of
our
country
club
instead
of
some
dude
like
that
sissified
buck
simpson
buck
is
as
punk
an
athlete
as
he
is
a
shoeman
and
believe
me
appleby
we
got
the
makings
of
a
fine
country
club
we
expect
to
have
a
and
and
and
all
them
things
before
long
we
got
a
right
now
and
every
fourthajuly
we
all
go
for
a
picnic
now
ca
the
madam
come
make
it
supper
this
evening
but
say
i
want
to
warn
you
that
if
we
ever
did
talk
business
i
do
see
how
i
could
very
well
offer
you
more
than
a
interest
in
any
case
no
growled
father
would
take
over
a
third
interest
believe
in
demanding
too
much
live
and
let
live
that
my
motto
yes
sir
and
a
fine
motto
it
is
too
admired
the
shoeman
what
time
is
supper
and
before
i
get
through
with
it
i
own
a
chain
of
from
here
to
indianapolis
said
father
i
be
good
for
twenty
more
business
and
i
wake
this
town
up
i
do
believe
you
will
father
but
i
just
ca
believe
yet
that
actually
signed
the
contract
and
are
a
partner
mother
yearned
why
it
ai
possible
guess
it
is
possible
though
judging
by
this
hundred
dollar
advance
father
chuckled
nice
fellow
that
shoeman
or
he
will
be
when
he
gets
over
thinking
i
a
tin
god
and
sits
down
and
plays
crib
like
i
was
an
ordinary
human
being
we
ought
to
have
larger
keep
peter
on
do
want
to
make
the
boy
lose
his
job
on
account
of
me
give
him
another
chance
i
just
wambling
mother
but
i
so
excited
at
having
a
job
again
with
tiny
pats
of
her
arm
he
stalked
the
street
conscious
of
the
admiring
gaze
of
the
villagers
among
whom
ran
the
news
that
the
famous
explorer
was
going
to
remain
with
them
when
the
landlord
himself
had
preceded
them
to
the
two
rooms
which
the
shoeman
had
engaged
for
the
applebys
at
the
star
hotel
father
chuckled
does
it
look
more
possible
now
with
these
rooms
eh
see
we
must
get
a
nice
little
picture
of
a
kitten
in
a
basket
to
hang
over
that
radiator
drat
the
landlord
i
thought
he
stick
here
all
evening
and
i
want
to
kiss
you
my
old
honey
my
comrade
chapter
xvii
the
lipsittsville
pioneer
shoe
store
found
seth
appleby
the
best
investment
it
had
ever
made
the
proprietor
was
timorous
about
having
given
away
per
cent
of
his
profits
but
appleby
did
attract
customers
from
the
banker
daughter
to
farmers
from
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
he
really
did
sell
more
shoes
he
became
a
person
of
lasting
importance
in
a
village
every
clerk
every
tradesman
has
something
of
the
same
distinctive
importance
as
the
doctors
the
lawyers
the
ministers
it
really
makes
a
difference
to
you
when
jim
smith
changes
from
grocery
to
robinson
because
jim
knows
what
kind
of
you
like
and
your
second
cousin
married
jim
best
friend
bill
blank
the
tailor
is
not
just
a
mysterious
agent
who
produces
your
clothes
but
a
real
personality
whose
wife
bonnet
is
worth
your
study
even
though
you
are
the
wife
of
the
mayor
so
to
every
person
in
lipsittsville
seth
appleby
was
not
just
a
lowly
person
on
a
stool
who
helped
one
in
the
choice
of
shoes
he
was
a
person
he
was
their
brother
to
be
loved
or
hated
if
he
had
gone
out
of
the
shoe
business
there
would
have
been
something
else
for
him
to
do
he
would
have
sold
farm
machinery
or
driven
on
a
rural
mail
route
or
collected
rents
and
have
kept
the
same
acquaintances
it
was
very
pleasant
to
father
to
pass
down
the
village
street
in
the
sun
to
call
the
town
policeman
ben
and
the
town
banker
major
and
the
town
newspaperman
lym
and
to
be
hailed
as
seth
in
return
it
was
diverting
to
join
the
little
group
of
men
in
the
back
of
the
filson
land
and
farms
company
office
and
have
even
the
heroes
of
gettysburg
pet
him
as
a
promising
young
adventurer
and
ask
for
his
tales
of
tramping
father
was
rather
when
he
saw
how
the
town
accepted
his
pretense
of
being
an
explorer
but
when
he
tried
to
tell
the
truth
everybody
thought
that
he
was
merely
being
modest
and
he
finally
settled
down
contentedly
to
being
a
hero
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
the
town
which
pointed
out
to
unfortunate
citizens
of
freiburg
and
hongkong
and
bryan
and
other
rival
villages
that
none
of
them
had
a
real
hero
with
all
modern
geographical
improvements
in
time
as
his
partner
the
shoeman
had
predicted
father
was
elected
president
of
the
clubless
country
club
and
organized
a
hike
in
which
he
outdistanced
all
the
others
including
the
young
and
boastful
buck
simpson
he
was
slowly
recognized
as
being
in
society
to
tell
the
truth
most
of
lipsittsville
was
in
society
but
a
few
citizens
were
barney
bachschluss
the
tony
who
sawed
wood
and
mowed
lawns
the
workmen
on
the
and
on
the
railway
father
was
serenely
established
upon
a
social
plane
infinitely
loftier
than
theirs
he
wore
a
giddy
spotted
tie
and
his
grand
good
gray
trousers
were
rigidly
creased
he
read
editorials
in
the
indianapolis
paper
and
discussed
them
with
doc
schergan
at
the
the
only
trouble
was
that
mother
had
nothing
to
do
she
was
discontented
in
their
two
rooms
at
the
star
hotel
no
longer
could
she
as
in
her
long
years
of
flat
life
in
new
york
be
content
to
sit
dreaming
and
reading
the
paper
she
was
as
brisk
and
strong
and
effective
as
father
open
woods
and
the
windy
road
had
given
her
a
restless
joy
in
energy
she
made
a
gown
of
gray
silk
and
joined
the
chautauqua
circle
but
that
was
not
enough
on
an
evening
of
late
august
when
a
breeze
was
in
the
maples
when
the
sunset
was
turquoise
and
citron
green
and
the
streets
were
serenely
happy
father
took
her
out
for
a
walk
they
passed
the
banker
mansion
with
its
big
curving
screened
porch
and
its
tower
and
brought
up
at
a
row
of
modern
bungalows
which
had
just
been
completed
i
wanted
you
to
see
these
said
father
because
some
time
this
is
a
secret
i
been
keeping
some
time
i
guess
we
be
able
to
rent
one
of
these
do
see
why
we
ca
early
next
year
the
way
things
are
going
oh
father
she
said
almost
tearfully
would
you
like
it
like
it
with
a
real
house
and
something
to
keep
my
hands
busy
and
maybe
a
kitty
and
i
would
make
you
tea
i
so
tired
of
hotel
food
and
we
would
sit
out
here
on
the
porch
yes
you
have
old
seth
appleby
for
customer
he
better
anybody
they
got
on
cape
cod
yes
and
you
better
too
father
you
old
honeymooner
say
i
got
an
idea
i
wonder
if
we
sneak
in
a
look
inside
of
one
of
these
bungalows
let
try
this
door
he
shook
the
of
a
bungalow
so
new
that
laths
and
mortar
were
still
scattered
about
the
yard
the
door
was
locked
he
tried
the
windows
as
well
but
he
could
not
get
in
three
other
bungalows
they
tried
and
the
fourth
the
last
of
the
row
was
already
occupied
but
they
did
steal
up
on
the
porch
of
one
bungalow
and
they
exclaimed
like
children
when
they
beheld
the
big
the
huge
fireplace
the
shelves
and
beyond
the
what
seemed
to
be
the
with
an
enormous
chandelier
which
may
not
perhaps
have
been
of
the
delicate
reticence
of
a
silver
candlestick
but
whose
jags
and
blobs
of
ruby
and
emerald
and
purple
glass
filled
their
hearts
with
awe
we
get
one
of
these
houses
father
vowed
i
thought
you
like
them
i
swear
i
cut
out
my
smoking
if
necessary
say
got
another
idea
i
wonder
if
we
could
make
up
some
excuse
and
butt
into
the
bungalow
that
been
rented
and
see
how
it
looks
furnished
i
understand
there
some
living
there
we
sort
of
make
them
a
neighborly
call
oh
do
you
think
we
ought
to
mother
she
who
had
faced
a
sheriff
was
timorous
about
facing
an
irate
matron
and
she
tagged
hesitatingly
after
father
as
he
marched
along
the
row
of
bungalows
up
the
steps
of
the
one
that
was
rented
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
maid
in
a
lipsittsville
version
of
a
uniform
lady
or
gent
o
the
house
in
asked
father
airily
sticking
his
new
derby
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
thrusting
a
thumb
in
an
armhole
very
impudent
and
fresh
and
youthful
no
sir
said
the
maid
stupidly
mother
sighed
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
wanted
to
see
the
promised
land
of
this
bungalow
well
say
girl
appleby
and
i
are
thinking
of
renting
one
of
these
here
bungalonies
like
the
fellow
says
and
i
wonder
if
we
could
take
a
look
at
this
house
to
see
how
it
looks
furnished
the
maid
stared
dumbly
at
him
looked
suspiciously
at
mother
apparently
she
decided
that
though
the
flamboyant
father
was
likely
to
steal
everything
in
the
house
mother
was
a
person
to
be
trusted
and
she
mumbled
yass
i
gass
so
father
led
the
way
in
and
mother
stumbled
over
every
possible
obstacle
so
absorbed
was
she
by
the
intimate
pleasantness
which
furniture
gave
to
this
big
as
large
as
the
whole
of
their
flat
in
new
york
actually
the
furniture
was
impressive
just
a
few
good
willow
chairs
a
big
couch
a
solid
table
there
were
only
two
or
three
pictures
one
rug
and
in
the
shelves
no
books
at
all
but
it
had
space
and
cheerfulness
it
was
a
home
here
the
with
butler
pantry
and
that
door
on
the
right
looks
like
it
might
be
a
bedroom
father
announced
after
a
hasty
exploration
while
the
maid
stared
doubtfully
he
went
on
half
whispering
let
peep
into
the
bedroom
no
no
we
must
do
that
mother
insisted
but
regretfully
for
she
was
already
wondering
where
if
she
were
running
things
she
would
put
a
she
had
always
agreed
with
matilda
tubbs
that
belonged
in
bedrooms
while
the
maid
shadowed
him
and
mother
opened
her
mouth
to
rebuke
him
father
boldly
pushed
open
the
door
on
the
right
he
had
guessed
correctly
it
was
a
bedroom
mother
haughtily
stayed
in
the
center
of
the
but
she
could
help
glancing
through
the
open
door
and
she
sighed
enviously
as
she
saw
the
splendor
of
twin
beds
with
a
little
table
and
an
electric
light
between
them
and
the
open
door
of
a
tiled
bathroom
it
was
too
much
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
should
have
left
her
silk
sweater
on
the
foot
of
one
bed
mother
had
wanted
a
silk
sweater
ever
since
she
had
beheld
one
flaunted
on
cape
cod
father
darted
out
seized
her
wrists
dragged
her
into
the
bedroom
and
while
she
was
exploding
in
the
lecture
he
so
richly
deserved
she
stopped
transfixed
father
was
pointing
to
a
picture
over
one
bed
and
smiling
strangely
the
picture
was
an
oldish
one
in
a
blackened
old
frame
it
showed
a
baby
playing
with
kittens
why
gasped
mother
why
why
it
just
like
the
picture
it
the
picture
that
we
got
when
lulu
was
born
that
we
had
to
leave
on
the
cape
yump
said
father
he
still
smiled
strangely
he
pointed
at
the
table
between
the
twin
beds
on
the
table
was
a
little
brown
dusty
book
mother
gazed
at
it
dazedly
her
step
was
feeble
as
she
tottered
between
the
beds
picked
up
the
book
opened
it
it
was
the
new
testament
which
she
had
had
since
girlhood
which
she
had
carried
all
through
their
hike
which
she
supposed
to
be
in
their
rooms
back
at
the
star
hotel
there
was
a
giggle
from
the
doorway
and
the
apparently
stupid
maid
was
there
bowing
lena
has
our
trunk
come
from
the
hotel
father
asked
yessir
i
just
been
sneaking
it
in
the
back
way
welcome
home
mum
said
the
maid
and
shut
the
door
from
the
other
side
mother
suddenly
crumpled
burrowed
her
head
against
father
shoulder
and
sobbed
this
is
ours
our
own
now
yes
mother
it
sure
am
ours
father
still
tried
to
speak
airily
but
in
his
voice
were
passion
and
a
grave
happiness
it
ours
and
every
stick
of
the
furniture
more
than
half
paid
for
already
i
did
tell
you
how
well
we
doing
at
the
store
say
golly
i
sure
did
have
a
time
training
lena
to
play
the
game
like
she
did
know
us
she
thought
i
was
plumb
nutty
at
first
and
i
have
a
maid
too
marveled
mother
yes
and
a
garden
if
you
want
to
keep
busy
outdoors
and
a
phonograph
with
nineteen
records
musical
and
comic
by
jiminy
to
prove
which
he
darted
back
into
the
started
molly
magee
my
girl
and
to
its
cheerful
strains
he
danced
a
fantastic
jig
while
the
maid
stared
from
the
and
mother
at
the
bedroom
door
wept
undisguisedly
murmuring
oh
my
boy
my
boy
that
planned
it
all
to
surprise
me
chapter
xviii
mother
had
after
an
energetic
september
succeeded
in
putting
all
the
furniture
to
rights
and
in
evoking
curtains
and
linen
anybody
even
the
impractical
father
can
fill
a
house
with
furniture
but
it
takes
two
women
and
at
least
four
weeks
to
make
the
furniture
look
as
though
it
had
grown
there
she
had
roamed
the
fields
and
brought
home
and
michaelmas
daisies
and
maple
leaves
she
no
longer
panted
or
felt
dizzy
when
she
ran
up
the
stairs
she
was
a
far
younger
woman
than
the
discreet
brown
hermit
of
the
dusty
new
york
flat
just
as
the
new
father
who
had
responsibility
and
affairs
was
younger
than
the
pilkings
clerk
of
old
always
she
watched
for
father
he
usually
came
prancing
home
so
happily
that
one
evening
when
mother
saw
him
slowly
plod
down
the
street
his
head
low
his
hands
sagging
his
pockets
she
ran
out
to
the
porch
and
greeted
him
with
a
despairing
what
is
it
seth
oh
nothing
much
before
he
would
go
on
father
put
his
arm
about
her
ample
waist
and
led
her
to
the
new
overlooking
the
raw
spaded
patch
of
earth
that
would
be
a
some
day
that
already
to
their
imaginations
was
brilliant
with
blossoms
and
alive
with
birds
she
observed
him
mutely
anxiously
he
handed
a
letter
to
her
it
was
in
their
daughter
handwriting
dear
papa
and
mama
i
do
know
if
this
letter
will
reach
you
but
have
been
reading
pieces
in
saserkopee
papers
about
your
and
hear
you
are
at
a
town
called
lipsittsville
oh
how
could
you
run
away
from
the
beautiful
home
harris
i
gave
you
i
am
sure
if
there
was
anything
we
did
do
for
comfort
happiness
you
had
only
to
ask
here
you
go
and
make
us
a
laughing
stock
in
saserkopee
we
had
told
everyone
you
would
be
at
our
party
suddenly
you
up
disappear
it
has
taken
us
months
to
get
in
touch
with
you
such
a
wicked
untruthful
lie
about
friend
sick
in
boston
all
harris
heard
from
a
traveling
salesman
he
agreed
with
harris
how
thoughtless
and
wilful
you
are
he
told
harris
that
you
are
at
this
place
lipsittsville
so
i
will
address
you
there
try
see
if
letter
reaches
you
tell
you
that
though
you
must
be
ashamed
of
your
conduct
by
now
we
are
willing
to
forgive
forget
i
was
never
one
to
hold
a
grudge
i
am
sure
if
you
had
just
stopped
and
thought
you
would
have
realized
to
what
worry
and
inconvenience
you
have
put
us
if
this
does
reach
you
by
now
i
guess
you
will
have
had
enough
of
being
bums
or
pedestrians
or
whatever
fancy
name
you
call
yourself
and
be
glad
to
come
back
to
a
good
home
and
see
if
you
ca
show
a
little
sense
as
you
ought
to
at
your
time
of
life
just
think
of
what
the
effect
must
be
on
harry
when
his
very
own
acts
this
way
if
you
will
telegraph
me
or
write
me
if
you
have
not
got
enough
money
for
telegraphing
harris
will
come
for
you
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
for
you
we
think
and
hope
that
a
place
can
be
found
for
you
in
the
cyrus
ginn
old
people
home
where
you
can
spend
your
last
days
i
guess
this
time
you
will
want
to
behave
yourselves
and
harris
i
will
be
glad
to
have
you
at
our
home
from
time
to
time
after
all
my
love
thoughtfulness
for
you
but
i
guess
i
need
not
say
anything
more
by
this
time
you
will
have
learned
your
lesson
your
loving
daughter
lulu
father
and
mother
had
sat
proudly
on
their
porch
the
night
before
and
they
had
greeted
chattily
like
people
of
substance
people
healthy
and
happy
and
responsible
now
they
shrank
on
the
swing
they
saw
nothing
but
lulu
determined
disdain
for
their
youthful
naughtiness
heard
nothing
but
her
voice
hard
unceasing
commenting
complaining
and
the
obese
and
humorless
humor
of
harris
hartwig
she
ca
make
us
go
back
confine
us
in
this
here
home
for
old
folks
can
she
legally
it
was
mother
who
turned
to
father
for
reassurance
no
no
certainly
not
i
do
so
they
sat
still
they
seemed
old
again
just
before
dinner
he
started
up
from
the
swing
craftily
laid
his
finger
beside
his
nose
and
whispered
something
very
exciting
and
mysterious
to
mother
who
kept
saying
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
i
be
willing
to
though
it
would
be
hard
immediately
after
dinner
they
walked
sedately
down
the
village
street
while
blackbirds
whistled
from
the
pond
and
children
sang
ancient
chants
of
play
under
the
at
corners
and
neighbors
cried
to
them
from
chairs
on
porches
they
called
upon
the
town
newspaperman
old
lyman
ford
and
there
was
a
conference
with
much
laughter
and
pounding
of
knees
also
a
pitcher
of
lemonade
conjointly
prepared
by
appleby
and
ford
finally
the
applebys
paraded
to
the
and
to
harris
hartwig
at
saserkopee
they
sent
this
message
come
see
us
when
can
wire
at
once
what
day
and
train
will
meet
a
sodden
and
pathetic
figure
in
his
notorious
shirt
and
the
suit
or
the
unsuit
which
he
had
worn
into
lipsittsville
in
the
days
when
he
had
been
a
hobo
father
waited
for
the
evening
train
and
for
harris
hartwig
hartwig
descended
the
car
steps
like
a
general
entering
a
conquered
province
father
nervously
concealed
his
greasy
with
his
left
hand
and
held
out
his
right
hand
deprecatingly
hartwig
took
it
into
his
strong
virile
but
slightly
damp
clasp
and
held
it
a
thing
which
father
devoutly
hated
while
he
gazed
magnanimously
into
father
shy
eyes
and
in
a
confidential
growl
which
could
scarce
have
been
heard
farther
away
than
indianapolis
condescended
well
here
we
are
i
glad
there
an
end
to
all
this
wickedness
and
foolishness
at
last
where
mother
appleby
she
was
feeling
jus
like
coming
father
mumbled
i
take
you
to
her
how
the
devil
are
you
earning
a
living
why
the
gent
that
owns
the
biggest
here
was
so
kind
as
to
give
me
sort
of
work
round
the
store
like
yuh
as
porter
i
venture
you
might
just
as
well
be
sensible
for
once
in
your
life
father
and
learn
that
you
past
the
age
where
you
can
insist
and
demand
and
get
any
kind
of
work
or
any
kind
of
a
place
to
live
in
that
just
suits
your
own
business
charity
you
know
and
all
these
working
people
that
think
a
business
is
run
just
to
suit
and
that
why
you
ought
to
have
been
more
appreciative
of
all
lulu
did
for
you
and
then
running
away
and
bringing
her
just
about
to
the
verge
of
nervous
prostration
worrying
over
you
they
had
left
the
station
now
and
were
passing
along
maple
avenue
with
its
glory
of
trees
and
shining
lawns
the
new
presbyterian
church
and
the
carnegie
library
hartwig
of
saserkopee
was
getting
far
too
much
satisfaction
out
of
his
r√¥le
as
sage
and
counselor
to
notice
maple
avenue
he
never
had
the
chance
to
play
that
r√¥le
when
the
wife
of
his
bosom
was
about
another
thing
hartwig
was
booming
as
they
approached
the
row
of
bungalows
where
the
applebys
lived
you
ought
to
have
understood
the
hardship
you
were
bringing
on
mother
by
taking
her
away
from
our
care
and
you
always
pretending
to
be
so
fond
of
her
and
all
i
want
to
rub
it
in
or
nothing
but
i
always
did
say
that
i
was
suspicious
of
these
fellows
that
are
always
petting
and
stewing
over
their
wives
in
public
you
can
be
dead
sure
that
in
private
they
ai
got
any
more
real
consideration
thoughtfulness
for
than
than
anything
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
now
here
you
are
why
just
one
look
at
you
is
enough
to
show
you
a
failure
why
my
wears
a
suit
than
that
though
father
felt
an
acute
desire
to
climb
upon
a
convenient
and
punch
the
noble
roman
head
of
harris
hartwig
he
kept
silent
and
looked
as
meek
as
he
could
and
encouraged
his
dear
to
go
on
we
try
to
find
some
decent
respectable
work
for
you
said
hartwig
you
be
at
liberty
to
be
away
from
the
old
people
home
for
several
hours
a
day
perfect
freedom
and
perhaps
now
and
then
you
can
help
at
a
sale
at
a
saserkopee
is
as
you
probably
know
the
best
town
of
its
size
in
new
york
and
if
you
did
feel
you
had
to
keep
in
touch
with
business
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
why
you
came
clear
out
here
to
the
west
little
dinky
town
with
no
prospects
or
nothing
why
even
you
at
your
age
could
turn
a
few
dollars
in
saserkopee
with
my
influence
there
i
could
throw
things
your
way
then
bitterly
though
of
course
i
would
expect
any
thanks
they
turned
a
corner
came
to
a
row
of
new
bungalows
the
whole
block
was
filled
with
small
black
village
ones
but
very
comfortable
and
dependable
in
a
bungalow
at
the
end
of
the
block
a
phonograph
was
being
loud
and
cheery
somebody
giving
a
party
hartwig
oracularly
informed
father
why
sure
enough
so
somebody
is
yes
yes
it
must
be
my
boss
where
i
live
boss
lets
us
bunk
in
the
father
voice
was
excited
slightly
hysterical
hartwig
looked
at
him
wonderingly
what
do
you
mean
the
he
asked
in
a
puzzled
way
i
show
you
said
father
and
in
a
low
poisonous
voice
he
added
certain
words
which
could
not
be
made
out
but
which
sounded
curiously
like
you
great
big
fat
weevily
ham
we
ca
butt
into
this
party
protested
hartwig
suddenly
feeling
himself
in
a
strange
town
among
strangers
as
father
took
his
arm
in
front
of
the
bungalow
where
the
party
was
being
fearlessly
enacted
i
never
knew
you
to
hesitate
about
butting
in
before
said
father
some
day
i
hope
you
butt
into
the
cyrus
ginn
home
for
old
fossils
but
now
while
hartwig
followed
him
in
alarm
father
skipped
up
the
steps
jabbed
at
the
the
door
opened
on
the
and
on
a
tableau
in
the
center
of
a
group
of
people
stood
mother
gorgeous
in
a
gown
like
a
herald
tabard
she
was
as
magnificent
as
one
of
the
larger
chairs
in
a
new
york
hotel
lobby
her
hair
was
waved
she
was
coldly
staring
at
harris
through
a
platinum
lorgnon
round
her
were
the
√©lite
of
lipsittsville
the
set
that
wore
dinner
coats
and
drove
cars
a
slim
and
pretty
girl
in
silk
bowed
elaborately
a
tall
man
with
an
imperial
chuckled
why
harris
this
is
ver
ver
pleasant
i
had
almost
forgotten
you
were
coming
mother
said
languidly
harris
could
not
know
that
the
distinguished
pedestrian
actor
impresario
and
capitalist
seth
appleby
had
spent
two
hours
and
seventeen
minutes
in
training
the
unwilling
mother
to
deliver
this
speech
if
mother
stumbled
somewhat
as
she
went
on
that
merely
enhanced
her
manner
of
delicate
languor
so
pleasant
to
see
you
just
a
few
of
our
friends
dropped
in
for
a
little
informal
gathering
would
you
like
to
wash
up
and
join
us
seth
dear
will
you
ring
for
lena
and
have
her
take
dear
harris
bag
to
his
room
did
you
bring
your
evening
clothes
harris
one
time
in
his
life
harris
had
rented
evening
clothes
but
otherwise
they
did
give
harris
a
chance
to
ask
for
explanations
when
still
in
his
dusty
bulbous
gray
sack
suit
he
hesitated
out
of
his
pleasant
room
he
found
that
father
had
changed
to
dinner
coat
and
a
stock
which
he
was
old
enough
to
wear
with
distinction
harris
was
firmly
introduced
to
lyman
ford
sole
owner
and
proprietor
of
the
lipsittsville
he
was
backed
into
a
corner
and
filled
with
tidings
about
the
glories
of
and
seth
appleby
their
social
position
and
athletic
prowess
and
financial
solidity
and
the
general
surpassing
greatness
of
lipsittsville
in
fact
ford
overdid
it
a
little
and
hartwig
began
to
look
suspicious
like
a
man
about
to
sneeze
or
one
who
fears
that
you
are
going
to
try
to
borrow
money
from
him
but
with
an
awkward
wonder
which
expressed
itself
in
his
growing
shyness
his
awkwardness
his
rapidly
increasing
deference
to
father
hartwig
saw
lena
the
maid
spread
forth
tables
for
the
social
and
intellectual
game
of
progressive
euchre
saw
father
combat
mightily
with
that
king
of
squire
trowbridge
saw
the
winners
presented
with
prizes
and
there
were
refreshments
the
lipsittsville
would
in
next
thursday
issue
be
able
to
say
dainty
refreshments
consisting
of
coffee
macaroons
and
several
kinds
of
pleasing
sandwiches
were
served
miss
mattie
ford
the
society
editor
of
the
was
at
her
wittiest
during
the
and
a
discussion
of
roosevelt
and
the
creamery
engaged
some
of
the
brightest
minds
in
lipsittsville
father
listening
entranced
whispered
to
mother
as
he
passed
her
with
his
tray
of
i
guess
harris
do
hear
any
bright
talk
like
this
in
saserkopee
look
at
him
i
always
said
he
looked
like
a
frog
except
that
he
looks
more
like
a
hog
i
wo
have
you
carrying
on
and
being
rude
mother
said
most
convincingly
the
party
did
not
end
till
clear
after
eleven
when
the
street
was
loud
with
the
noise
of
cars
starting
and
quantities
of
ladies
in
silk
wraps
laughingly
took
their
departure
harris
hartwig
stood
deserted
by
the
fireplace
when
the
door
had
closed
on
the
last
of
the
revelers
father
returned
glanced
once
at
him
coldly
stopped
to
pick
up
a
chair
which
had
been
upset
then
stalked
up
to
harris
and
faced
him
boring
him
with
an
accusing
glance
well
said
harris
uneasily
you
sure
got
say
i
certainly
got
to
hand
it
to
you
father
appleby
like
a
big
blubbery
he
complained
gee
i
do
think
it
fair
making
a
goat
of
me
this
way
when
i
came
to
do
you
a
service
and
take
you
home
and
all
he
was
so
meek
that
father
took
pity
on
him
we
call
it
square
he
said
i
guess
maybe
you
and
lulu
will
quit
worrying
now
at
last
yes
i
guess
we
have
to
say
father
this
seems
to
be
a
fine
live
prosperous
town
say
i
wonder
what
the
chances
for
opening
a
here
competition
is
getting
pretty
severe
in
saserkopee
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
married
the
lovely
lulu
harris
hartwig
seemed
to
care
for
his
opinion
father
took
one
horrified
glance
at
mother
the
prospect
of
the
hartwigs
planted
here
in
eden
like
a
whole
family
of
the
most
highly
irritating
serpents
seemed
to
have
paralyzed
her
it
was
father
who
turned
harris
flank
said
he
well
i
afraid
i
ca
encourage
you
there
three
good
stores
here
and
the
proprietors
of
all
of
them
are
friends
of
mine
and
i
afraid
i
could
do
a
thing
about
introducing
you
in
fact
i
feel
like
a
traitor
to
them
if
i
was
responsible
for
any
competition
with
them
so
but
some
time
perhaps
we
can
have
lulu
and
harry
here
for
a
visit
thank
you
father
well
well
i
guess
we
all
better
be
saying
good
night
father
ostentatiously
wound
up
the
clock
and
locked
the
doors
harris
watched
him
his
adam
apple
prettily
rising
and
falling
as
he
prepared
to
speak
and
hesitated
again
and
again
finally
as
father
yawned
and
extended
his
hand
harris
burst
out
say
how
the
deuce
did
you
get
this
house
and
all
what
the
idea
anyway
for
this
father
had
been
waiting
he
had
nineteen
large
batteries
concealed
in
ambush
and
he
fired
them
he
fixed
harris
with
a
glance
that
was
the
condensed
essence
of
all
the
in
the
world
young
man
he
snorted
i
do
discuss
my
business
affairs
but
i
do
mind
saying
that
i
am
partner
in
one
of
the
most
flourishing
mercantile
concerns
in
the
state
i
knew
that
lulu
and
you
would
never
believe
that
the
poor
old
folks
could
actually
run
their
own
business
unless
you
came
and
saw
for
yourself
i
stand
ready
to
refund
the
railroad
fare
you
spent
in
coming
here
now
are
you
satisfied
why
why
yes
well
then
i
guess
we
say
good
night
good
night
said
harris
forlornly
it
was
a
proof
of
their
complete
recovery
from
that
while
they
were
undressing
the
applebys
discussed
hartwig
only
for
a
moment
and
that
father
volunteered
i
actually
do
hope
that
lulu
and
harry
will
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
now
maybe
we
can
impress
her
too
i
hope
so
i
really
would
like
a
chance
to
love
our
daughter
a
little
do
seem
natural
we
should
always
have
to
be
scared
of
her
well
let
forget
the
hartwigs
they
come
around
now
catch
them
not
knowing
where
their
bread
is
buttered
why
think
maybe
lulu
will
let
me
kiss
her
some
day
without
criticizing
my
necktie
while
i
doing
it
the
innocents
the
conquering
babes
in
the
wood
put
out
all
the
lights
except
the
bedside
lamp
on
the
table
between
their
twin
beds
these
aristocratic
beds
were
close
enough
together
so
that
they
could
lie
with
their
hands
clasped
they
had
left
the
door
into
the
open
and
the
low
lights
from
the
coals
in
the
fireplace
made
a
path
across
the
polished
floor
and
the
new
rugs
a
vista
of
spaciousness
and
content
it
our
first
real
home
murmured
father
my
old
honey
we
come
home
we
have
the
tubbses

from
the
cape

yes
and
crook
mckusick
if
we
ever

from
him
and

cribbage

tubbs
four
games
out
of
five
say

woman

to
sleep

mother
drowsily
the
end
