men
of
from
the
of
the
animals
are
out
of
town
of
of
the
the
men
of
the
story
of
man
is
the
story
endlessly
repeated
of
a
struggle
between
light
and
darkness
between
knowledge
and
ignorance
between
good
and
evil
between
men
who
would
build
and
men
who
would
destroy
it
is
no
more
complicated
than
this
that
light
knowledge
good
and
constructive
men
have
had
a
small
edge
in
this
struggle
is
attested
to
by
our
slow
rise
over
the
long
millennia
of
time
in
taking
stock
of
our
successes
however
it
is
easy
to
assume
the
victory
has
been
won
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
this
is
a
contest
that
is
never
ended
nor
can
it
be
as
long
as
men
are
upon
the
earth
while
man
has
free
choice
the
elements
of
darkness
ignorance
evil
and
destruction
are
available
for
him
to
choose
and
there
are
times
when
these
seem
the
best
alternatives
at
the
end
of
the
century
one
of
the
greatest
minds
of
all
time
was
destroyed
by
one
stroke
of
a
guillotine
blade
the
judge
who
presided
at
the
trial
of
the
great
french
chemist
lavoisier
is
reported
to
have
said
the
republic
has
no
need
of
men
of
science
choices
like
this
have
often
been
made
by
the
society
of
man
a
turnoff
to
darkness
has
been
deliberately
taken
superstition
has
been
embraced
while
knowledge
has
been
destroyed
when
times
are
placid
we
assume
such
choices
could
result
only
from
some
great
insanity
that
the
men
who
made
them
had
themselves
known
more
pleasant
days
the
truth
is
that
there
are
extremes
of
circumstance
which
could
force
almost
any
man
to
abandon
that
which
he
has
always
held
to
be
right
and
good
and
only
the
very
giants
could
stand
up
and
prove
themselves
unmoved
such
giants
may
seem
in
ordinary
life
rather
obscure
illustrating
this
are
the
people
in
this
story
a
somewhat
pompous
little
mayor
a
professor
of
chemistry
in
a
college
in
the
mountain
west
a
minister
of
the
gospel
who
would
be
lost
with
a
congregation
a
sheriff
who
does
care
what
happens
to
him
personally
as
long
as
he
sticks
to
the
kind
of
rightness
that
has
always
worked
and
a
boy
who
learns
what
it
means
to
do
a
man
work
such
people
are
important
the
most
important
people
alive
today
they
are
the
ones
whose
hands
hold
all
that
our
culture
has
achieved
when
catastrophe
overtakes
us
the
illusion
of
security
is
a
vicious
one
with
physical
comforts
around
us
the
abyss
that
is
just
beyond
our
walls
is
forgotten
the
abyss
of
outer
space
beyond
the
atmosphere
shielding
us
of
the
fires
in
the
earth
beneath
of
the
hurricane
winds
beyond
the
horizon
of
the
evil
and
insanity
in
the
minds
of
many
men
the
caveman
dared
not
forget
these
abysses
nor
the
frontiersman
nor
the
scientist
who
fought
the
witch
hunters
to
bring
forth
a
new
truth
of
nature
but
when
we
believe
we
are
secure
we
do
forget
them
in
catastrophe
the
most
recent
achievements
of
the
race
are
the
first
to
go
when
war
comes
or
mobs
attack
or
hurricanes
strike
our
science
and
our
arts
are
abandoned
first
necessity
of
survival
seems
to
insist
that
we
can
not
fool
with
things
of
the
mind
and
of
the
soul
when
destruction
threatens
the
body
and
so
the
republic
has
no
need
of
men
of
science
emergency
can
take
any
form
here
is
a
story
in
which
the
mechanical
foundation
of
our
culture
is
threatened
whether
the
means
of
this
threat
as
i
have
pictured
it
could
possibly
occur
i
do
not
know
i
know
of
no
reason
why
it
could
not
if
circumstances
were
right
but
more
important
this
is
what
happens
to
a
small
college
town
caught
up
in
such
disaster
how
quickly
do
its
people
dispense
with
their
men
of
science
and
turn
to
superstition
and
mob
rule
for
hope
of
survival
it
is
perhaps
not
so
apparent
to
those
of
us
who
have
grown
up
with
it
but
we
have
witnessed
in
our
own
time
under
threat
of
calamity
the
decline
of
science
before
a
blight
of
engineering
technology
today
we
hear
it
faintly
whispered
the
republic
has
no
need
of
men
of
science
insofar
as
he
represents
the
achievements
of
our
race
over
the
great
reaches
of
time
the
scientist
will
always
be
needed
if
we
are
to
retain
the
foothold
we
have
gained
over
nature
the
witch
doctors
and
the
fortunetellers
clamor
for
his
niche
and
will
gladly
extend
their
services
if
we
wish
to
change
our
allegiance
the
story
of
the
year
when
stardust
fell
is
not
a
story
of
the
distant
future
or
of
the
remote
past
it
is
not
a
story
of
a
land
where
fantastic
happenings
take
place
daily
it
is
a
story
of
my
town
and
yours
of
people
like
you
and
me
and
the
mayor
in
townhall
his
sheriff
on
the
corner
and
the
professor
in
the
university
a
story
that
happens
no
later
than
tomorrow
j
chapter
the
comet
was
the
only
thing
in
the
whole
sky
all
the
stars
were
smothered
by
the
light
of
its
flame
and
although
the
sun
had
set
two
hours
ago
the
earth
was
lit
as
with
the
glow
of
a
thunderous
dawn
in
mayfield
ken
maddox
walked
slowly
along
main
street
avoiding
collisions
with
other
people
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
object
in
the
sky
ken
had
spent
scores
of
hours
observing
the
comet
carefully
both
by
naked
eye
and
with
his
reflecting
telescope
still
he
could
not
keep
from
watching
it
as
he
picked
his
way
along
the
street
toward
the
post
office
the
comet
had
been
approaching
earth
for
months
growing
steadily
to
bigger
proportions
in
the
sky
but
tonight
was
a
very
special
night
and
mayfield
was
watching
with
increased
awe
and
as
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
other
communities
around
the
world
tonight
the
earth
entered
the
comet
tail
and
during
the
coming
winter
would
be
swept
continuously
by
its
spread
there
was
no
visible
change
the
astronomers
had
cautioned
that
none
was
to
be
expected
the
earth
had
passed
through
the
tails
of
comets
before
although
briefly
and
none
of
the
inhabitants
had
been
physically
aware
of
the
event
this
time
there
was
a
difference
as
intangible
as
a
mere
suspicion
it
could
yet
be
felt
and
there
was
the
expectancy
of
the
unknown
in
the
air
ken
prided
himself
on
a
scientific
attitude
but
it
was
hard
not
to
share
the
feelings
of
those
around
him
that
something
momentous
and
mysterious
was
taking
place
this
night
there
would
be
no
quick
passage
this
time
earth
would
lie
within
the
tail
for
a
period
of
over
four
months
as
they
both
made
their
way
about
the
sun
such
orbits
had
never
occurred
before
in
the
known
history
of
the
world
it
frightening
is
it
ken
was
aware
that
he
had
stopped
at
the
edge
of
a
crowd
in
front
of
billings
drugstore
and
beside
him
maria
larsen
was
staring
intently
upward
as
she
spoke
she
was
a
small
blonde
girl
with
intense
blue
eyes
ken
smiled
confidently
and
looked
down
at
her
no
he
said
it
a
beautiful
thing
it
a
kind
of
miracle
that
we
should
be
alive
when
it
happened
no
human
beings
have
ever
seen
such
a
sight
before
maria
shivered
faintly
i
wish
i
could
feel
that
way
do
you
think
it
will
get
any
bigger
yes
it
will
not
reach
its
closest
approach
for
over
three
months
yet
its
approach
is
very
slow
so
we
wo
notice
much
change
it
is
beautiful
maria
agreed
slowly
but
still
it
frightening
i
be
glad
when
it
gone
ken
laughed
and
tucked
the
girl
arm
in
his
there
was
something
so
disturbingly
serious
about
the
swedish
girl
who
was
spending
a
year
in
mayfield
with
her
parents
her
father
larsen
was
a
visiting
professor
of
chemistry
engaged
to
teach
this
season
at
the
state
agricultural
college
in
mayfield
ken
own
father
was
head
of
the
chemistry
department
there
come
down
to
the
post
office
with
me
to
get
some
stamps
ken
said
then
i
drive
you
home
it
closed
you
ca
get
any
stamps
tonight
maybe
the
boys
in
gray
have
been
too
busy
watching
the
comet
to
stock
the
stamp
machine
look
out
he
pulled
her
back
quickly
as
she
stepped
from
the
curb
a
wheezy
car
moved
past
its
driver
completely
intent
on
his
observation
of
the
comet
old
dad
martin
been
trying
to
wrap
that
thing
around
a
pole
for
years
ken
said
unhappily
it
looks
like
he
going
to
make
it
tonight
along
the
street
bystanders
whistled
at
the
aged
driver
and
pedestrians
yelled
at
one
another
to
get
out
of
the
way
the
progress
broke
for
a
moment
the
sense
of
ominous
concern
that
spread
over
main
street
at
the
post
office
ken
found
maria
prediction
was
right
the
stamp
machine
was
empty
i
have
some
at
home
the
girl
said
you
welcome
to
them
i
need
a
lot
mother
sending
out
some
invitations
i
sure
i
have
enough
papa
says
i
supporting
the
postal
department
with
all
the
letters
i
write
to
everyone
at
home
in
sweden
all
right
i
take
you
up
on
it
i
get
skinned
if
i
do
get
them
i
was
supposed
to
pick
them
up
this
afternoon
and
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
thought
i
learned
good
english
in
the
schools
in
sweden
said
maria
wistfully
but
i
do
seem
to
understand
half
what
you
say
this
what
does
that
mean
nothing
you
need
to
worry
about
ken
laughed
if
you
would
teach
me
english
the
way
you
learned
it
miss
rymer
would
give
me
a
lot
better
marks
in
her
class
now
i
think
you
making
fun
of
me
said
maria
not
me
believe
me
i
not
hey
look
what
coming
down
the
street
that
old
granny
wicks
i
thought
she
had
died
a
long
time
ago
in
front
of
the
post
office
an
ancient
white
horse
drew
a
light
ramshackle
wagon
to
a
halt
from
the
seat
a
small
wizened
old
woman
looked
at
the
crowd
on
the
street
she
dropped
the
reins
in
front
of
her
her
eyes
set
deeply
in
her
wrinkled
face
were
bright
and
sharp
as
a
bird
and
moved
with
the
same
snapping
motions
from
both
sides
of
the
street
the
bystanders
watched
her
granny
wicks
was
known
to
everyone
in
mayfield
she
was
said
to
have
been
the
first
white
child
born
in
the
valley
almost
a
hundred
years
ago
at
one
time
her
horse
and
wagon
were
familiar
everyday
sights
on
the
streets
but
she
seldom
came
to
town
any
more
many
people
like
ken
had
had
the
vague
impression
that
she
was
dead
she
appeared
lively
enough
now
as
she
scrambled
down
from
the
wagon
seat
and
moved
across
the
sidewalk
to
the
post
office
steps
she
climbed
these
and
stood
in
front
of
the
doors
curiously
the
crowd
watched
her
listen
to
me
you
she
exclaimed
suddenly
her
voice
was
high
and
shrill
reminding
ken
of
an
angry
bird
maria
looked
at
him
wonderingly
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
ask
me
what
she
up
to
she
pulled
some
corkers
in
her
time
granny
wicks
looked
over
the
gathering
crowd
then
she
pointed
a
bony
arm
at
the
glowing
comet
you
know
what
it
means
she
exclaimed
shrilly
you
feel
it
in
your
bones
and
your
hearts
quiver
with
fear
there
death
in
the
sky
and
an
omen
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
destruction
awaits
men
she
stopped
and
glared
the
laughter
that
had
first
greeted
her
gave
way
to
uneasiness
as
people
glanced
at
their
neighbors
then
hastily
at
the
comet
and
back
to
granny
wicks
some
began
moving
away
in
discomfort
you
scared
to
listen
eh
granny
shrilled
at
them
you
afraid
to
know
what
in
store
turn
your
backs
then
close
your
ears
you
ca
change
the
signs
in
the
heavens
a
movement
in
the
crowd
caught
ken
eye
he
saw
the
stout
figure
of
sheriff
johnson
moving
toward
the
steps
the
law
officer
stepped
out
in
front
and
approached
granny
wicks
come
on
now
granny
said
sheriff
johnson
you
would
want
to
scare
folks
out
of
a
good
night
sleep
would
you
you
let
me
alone
sam
johnson
i
saying
what
i
have
to
say
and
nobody
going
to
stop
me
listen
to
me
all
of
you
there
death
in
mayfield
in
the
winter
that
coming
and
spring
wo
see
one
man
in
ten
left
alive
remember
what
i
say
the
stars
have
sent
their
messenger
okay
granny
let
go
said
the
sheriff
you
said
your
piece
and
scared
the
daylights
out
of
everybody
you
better
be
getting
on
out
to
your
place
before
it
gets
dark
the
comet
wo
light
things
up
all
night
how
your
supply
of
wood
and
coal
for
the
winter
granny
the
boys
been
getting
it
in
for
you
i
got
plenty
sam
johnson
i
need
for
this
winter
come
spring
i
wo
be
around
to
be
needing
anything
else
from
anybody
neither
will
you
the
sheriff
watched
as
the
old
woman
climbed
to
her
wagon
seat
again
those
standing
nearby
helped
her
gently
she
took
the
reins
and
snapped
them
at
the
weary
horse
take
care
of
yourself
granny
someone
called
sheriff
johnson
stood
silently
on
the
steps
until
the
wagon
passed
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
of
the
block
then
he
moved
slowly
by
ken
and
maria
he
smiled
grimly
at
ken
it
bad
enough
to
have
that
thing
hanging
up
there
in
the
sky
without
that
kind
of
talk
he
glanced
up
for
a
moment
it
gives
you
the
willies
sometimes
i
wonder
myself
if
granny
is
there
was
a
stillness
in
the
street
as
the
people
slowly
dispersed
ahead
of
the
sheriff
voices
were
low
and
the
banter
was
gone
the
yellow
light
from
the
sky
cast
weird
bobbing
shadows
on
the
pavement
and
against
the
buildings
shall
we
go
maria
asked
this
is
giving
me
what
do
you
say
the
creeps
it
crazy
ken
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
feeling
it
shows
what
ignorance
of
something
new
and
strange
can
do
one
feebleminded
old
woman
can
infect
a
whole
crowd
with
her
crazy
superstitions
just
because
they
do
know
any
more
about
this
thing
than
she
does
it
more
than
that
said
maria
quietly
it
the
feeling
that
people
have
always
had
about
the
world
they
find
themselves
in
it
matter
how
much
you
know
about
the
ocean
and
the
winds
and
the
tides
there
is
always
a
feeling
of
wonder
and
fear
when
you
stand
on
the
shore
and
watch
enormous
waves
pounding
the
rocks
even
if
you
know
what
makes
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
you
watch
a
great
storm
without
feeling
very
small
and
puny
of
course
not
ken
said
astronomers
feel
all
that
when
they
look
a
couple
of
billion
into
space
physicists
know
it
when
they
discover
a
new
particle
of
matter
but
do
go
around
muttering
about
omens
and
signs
you
can
feel
the
strength
of
natural
forces
without
being
scared
to
death
maybe
that
what
marks
the
only
real
difference
between
witches
and
scientists
after
all
the
first
scientist
was
the
guy
who
saw
fire
come
down
from
the
sky
and
decided
that
was
the
answer
to
some
of
his
problems
the
witch
doctor
was
too
scared
of
both
the
problem
and
the
answer
to
believe
the
problem
could
ever
have
a
solution
so
he
manufactured
delusions
to
make
himself
and
others
think
the
problem
would
just
quietly
go
away
there
are
a
lot
of
witch
doctors
still
operating
and
they
not
all
as
easy
to
recognize
as
granny
wicks
they
reached
ken
car
and
he
held
the
door
open
for
maria
as
he
climbed
in
his
own
side
he
said
how
about
coming
over
to
my
place
and
having
a
look
at
the
comet
through
my
telescope
you
see
something
really
then
i
love
to
right
now
sure
ken
started
the
car
and
swung
away
from
the
curb
keeping
a
careful
eye
on
the
road
watching
for
any
others
like
dad
martin
sometimes
i
think
there
will
be
a
great
many
things
i
miss
when
we
go
back
to
sweden
maria
said
thoughtfully
as
she
settled
back
in
the
seat
enjoying
the
smooth
powerful
ride
of
ken
car
ken
shot
a
quick
glance
at
her
he
felt
a
sudden
sense
of
loss
as
if
he
had
not
realized
before
that
their
acquaintance
was
strictly
temporary
i
guess
a
lot
of
people
here
will
miss
the
larsens
too
he
said
quietly
what
will
you
miss
most
of
all
the
bigness
of
everything
said
maria
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
of
open
country
the
schoolboys
with
cars
to
cover
the
distance
at
home
a
grown
man
is
fortunate
to
have
one
papa
had
a
very
hard
time
owning
one
why
do
you
persuade
him
to
stay
here
mayfield
a
darn
good
place
to
live
i
tried
already
but
he
says
that
when
a
man
is
grown
he
has
too
many
things
to
hold
him
to
the
place
he
always
known
he
has
promised
however
to
let
me
come
back
if
i
want
to
after
i
finish
the
university
at
home
that
would
be
nice
ken
turned
away
keeping
his
eyes
intently
on
the
road
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
say
he
drove
slowly
up
the
long
grade
of
college
avenue
his
family
lived
in
an
older
house
a
block
below
the
brow
of
college
hill
it
gave
a
pleasant
view
of
the
entire
expanse
of
the
valley
in
which
mayfield
was
situated
the
houses
of
the
town
ranged
themselves
in
neat
orderly
rows
below
and
spread
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
business
section
in
the
distance
north
and
south
were
the
small
farms
where
hay
and
dairy
stock
and
truck
crops
had
been
raised
since
pioneer
times
i
miss
this
too
said
maria
it
beautiful
ken
was
listening
to
her
however
the
car
had
begun
to
sputter
painfully
as
it
took
the
curve
leading
off
the
avenue
to
linwood
street
where
ken
lived
he
glanced
at
the
heat
indicator
the
needle
was
almost
at
the
boiling
point
for
pete
sake
the
water
must
have
leaked
out
of
the
radiator
ken
pulled
the
car
to
the
curb
in
front
of
the
house
and
got
out
leaving
the
engine
idling
he
raised
the
hood
and
cautiously
turned
the
radiator
cap
with
his
handkerchief
a
cloud
of
steam
shot
out
but
when
he
lifted
the
cap
the
water
was
not
quite
boiling
and
there
was
plenty
of
it
maria
came
up
beside
him
is
something
wrong
you
got
me
there
the
radiator
clean
the
pump
is
more
than
two
months
old
i
checked
the
timing
last
saturday
something
gone
sour
to
make
her
heat
up
like
that
from
across
the
street
his
neighbor
wilkins
approached
with
a
grin
looks
like
the
same
thing
hit
us
both
mine
started
boiling
as
i
came
up
the
hill
tonight
it
got
me
stumped
the
circulation
must
be
clogged
said
ken
either
that
or
the
timing
has
slipped
off
that
all
it
could
be
those
were
my
ideas
too
both
wrong
in
my
case
let
me
know
if
you
get
any
other
bright
ones
he
moved
off
with
a
pleasant
wave
of
his
hand
it
will
cool
said
ken
to
maria
by
the
time
you
ready
to
leave
i
be
able
to
drive
you
home
i
would
want
you
to
damage
your
car
i
can
walk
we
see
he
led
her
around
the
house
in
the
center
of
the
backyard
loomed
the
high
round
dome
of
his
amateur
observatory
it
was
ken
personal
pride
as
well
as
that
of
the
members
of
the
mayfield
high
science
club
who
had
helped
build
the
shell
and
the
mountings
the
club
used
it
every
thursday
night
when
the
seeing
was
good
ken
had
ground
the
precision
mirror
alone
he
had
ground
his
first
one
a
glass
when
he
was
a
boy
scout
three
years
later
he
had
tackled
the
tremendous
job
of
producing
a
one
professor
douglas
of
the
physics
department
at
the
college
had
pronounced
it
perfect
ken
opened
the
door
and
switched
on
the
light
inside
the
dome
mind
the
mess
he
said
i
been
taking
photographs
of
the
comet
for
the
last
month
to
maria
who
was
used
to
the
clutter
of
a
laboratory
there
was
no
mess
she
admired
the
beauty
of
the
instrument
ken
and
his
friends
had
built
our
university
telescope
is
any
better
she
said
you
ca
tell
by
the
plumbing
ken
laughed
better
take
a
look
at
the
image
before
you
pass
judgment
skilfully
he
swung
the
long
tube
around
to
the
direction
of
the
comet
with
the
fine
controls
he
centered
the
cross
hairs
of
the
eyepiece
on
the
blazing
object
in
the
sky
it
moving
too
fast
to
stay
in
range
very
long
he
said
maria
stepped
to
the
observer
position
she
gasped
suddenly
at
the
image
of
the
fiery
monster
hovering
in
the
sky
viewing
the
comet
along
the
axis
of
the
tail
as
the
earth
lay
at
the
edge
of
it
an
vision
was
like
that
of
a
miniature
flaming
sun
with
an
offcenter
halo
of
pulsing
golden
light
to
maria
the
comet
seemed
like
something
living
slow
almost
imperceptible
ripples
in
the
glowing
scarves
of
light
made
them
sway
as
if
before
some
mighty
cosmic
wind
in
space
it
beautiful
maria
murmured
but
it
terrible
too
no
wonder
the
ancients
believed
comets
brought
evil
and
death
upon
the
earth
i
could
almost
believe
it
myself
chapter
ken
maddox
could
not
remember
a
time
when
he
had
not
wanted
to
become
a
scientist
maybe
it
started
when
his
father
first
invited
him
to
look
through
a
microscope
that
was
when
he
was
a
very
small
boy
but
he
could
still
remember
the
revelation
of
that
experience
he
remembered
how
it
had
seemed
on
looking
away
from
the
lens
that
the
whole
world
of
normal
vision
was
only
a
fragment
of
that
which
was
hidden
behind
curtains
and
shrouds
and
locked
doors
only
men
like
his
father
with
special
instruments
and
wisdom
and
knowledge
could
ever
hope
to
understand
the
world
of
the
unknown
which
the
ordinary
person
did
not
even
suspect
now
at
sixteen
ken
was
tall
with
black
hair
that
had
an
annoying
curl
to
it
he
was
husky
enough
to
be
the
main
asset
of
the
football
squad
of
mayfield
high
school
in
his
senior
year
he
knew
exactly
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
would
be
one
of
those
men
who
lived
beyond
the
mere
surface
of
the
world
and
who
would
seek
to
understand
its
deep
and
hidden
meanings
ken
thought
of
this
as
he
watched
maria
at
the
telescope
what
a
difference
between
knowing
the
comet
as
this
instrument
showed
it
and
with
the
knowledge
revealed
by
modern
astronomy
and
knowing
it
as
the
average
person
in
mayfield
did
ken
and
maria
stayed
in
the
observatory
until
the
comet
had
almost
disappeared
below
the
horizon
maddox
brought
a
snack
of
sandwiches
and
punch
i
always
do
this
when
i
see
the
observatory
dome
open
she
said
smiling
i
never
know
when
ken
going
to
quit
his
stargazing
and
come
in
for
the
night
we
about
through
mom
i
drive
maria
over
to
her
place
and
be
back
in
a
little
while
i
going
to
loan
him
the
stamps
maria
said
maddox
looked
at
ken
in
mock
severity
you
mean
you
forgot
no
i
remembered
ken
said
lamely
after
the
post
office
closed
that
is
anyhow
maria
has
plenty
well
said
maddox
i
know
who
going
to
have
to
mail
my
invitations
if
they
ever
to
get
out
in
time
for
the
party
after
he
and
maria
had
finished
the
snack
ken
started
his
car
again
the
engine
had
cooled
to
normal
temperature
but
he
watched
the
indicator
closely
as
he
drove
nothing
seemed
right
about
the
action
of
the
car
the
engine
had
turned
over
sluggishly
when
he
pressed
the
starter
button
as
if
the
battery
were
almost
dead
now
it
lugged
heavily
even
when
going
downhill
the
whole
thing
haywire
ken
said
irritably
it
acts
like
the
crankcase
is
full
of
sand
or
something
let
me
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
said
maria
you
take
the
car
back
and
i
bring
the
stamps
over
on
my
way
to
school
in
the
morning
no
we
almost
there
nothing
much
more
could
go
wrong
than
already
has
when
they
reached
maria
place
they
found
professor
and
larsen
sitting
on
the
porch
we
been
watching
the
comet
maria
said
excitedly
ken
let
me
look
at
it
through
his
telescope
a
remarkable
event
said
professor
larsen
i
feel
very
fortunate
to
be
alive
to
witness
it
my
generation
has
had
this
kind
of
privilege
before
i
was
a
child
when
halley
comet
appeared
i
been
trying
to
tell
maria
what
a
lucky
break
this
is
but
she
agrees
with
granny
wicks
said
ken
oh
i
do
not
maria
snapped
granny
wicks
professor
larsen
inquired
your
grandmother
no
ken
tried
to
cover
the
professor
lack
of
familiarity
with
american
idioms
she
just
the
town
oldest
citizen
everybody
likes
her
and
calls
her
granny
but
her
mind
belongs
to
the
middle
ages
you
hear
that
papa
cried
maria
her
mind
belongs
to
the
middle
ages
and
he
says
i
like
granny
wicks
maria
mother
laughed
gently
i
sure
ken
did
mean
your
mind
is
of
the
middle
ages
too
dear
ken
flushed
of
course
not
what
i
mean
is
that
granny
wicks
thinks
the
comet
is
something
mysterious
and
full
of
omens
and
maria
says
she
sort
of
thinks
the
same
about
it
i
did
say
anything
about
omens
and
signs
well
except
for
that
except
for
that
i
suppose
we
are
all
in
agreement
said
professor
larsen
slowly
he
drew
on
his
pipe
and
it
glowed
brightly
in
the
darkness
the
whole
universe
is
a
terrible
place
that
barely
tolerates
living
organisms
almost
without
exception
it
is
filled
with
great
suns
that
are
flaming
atomic
furnaces
or
dead
cinders
of
planets
to
which
a
scrap
of
poisonous
atmosphere
may
cling
yes
it
is
indeed
a
great
miracle
that
here
in
this
corner
of
the
universe
conditions
exist
where
living
things
have
found
a
foothold
we
may
be
glad
that
this
is
so
but
it
does
not
pay
man
to
ever
forget
the
fierceness
of
the
home
in
which
he
lives
earth
is
merely
one
room
of
that
home
on
the
pleasant
sunny
side
of
the
house
but
the
whole
universe
is
his
home
that
the
thing
i
been
trying
to
say
ken
answered
we
can
know
this
without
being
afraid
maria
father
nodded
yes
fear
is
of
no
use
to
anyone
awe
respect
admiration
wonder
humility
these
are
all
necessary
but
not
fear
maria
turned
from
the
group
i
bring
the
stamps
ken
she
said
wo
you
come
in
and
have
some
cake
larsen
asked
no
thanks
mother
fed
us
before
we
left
my
place
i
afraid
i
could
eat
any
more
in
a
moment
maria
was
back
here
are
two
whole
sheets
she
said
i
hope
that
will
be
enough
plenty
i
see
you
get
repaid
tomorrow
good
night
everybody
good
night
ken
he
moved
down
the
walk
toward
his
car
and
got
in
when
he
pressed
die
starter
button
the
engine
groaned
for
a
few
seconds
and
came
to
a
complete
stop
he
tried
again
there
was
only
a
momentary
protesting
grind
ken
got
out
and
raised
the
hood
and
leaned
over
the
engine
in
disgusted
contemplation
there
was
no
visible
clue
to
the
cause
of
the
trouble
is
your
battery
dead
professor
larsen
called
no
it
something
else
ken
slammed
the
hood
harder
than
he
had
intended
i
have
to
leave
it
here
overnight
and
pick
it
up
in
the
morning
i
can
push
you
home
with
my
car
or
at
least
give
you
a
ride
no
please
do
bother
ken
said
i
tow
it
home
with
dad
car
tomorrow
i
just
as
soon
walk
now
it
only
a
few
blocks
as
you
wish
good
night
ken
good
night
professor
ken
clock
radio
woke
him
the
next
morning
he
reached
over
to
shut
off
the
newscast
it
carried
there
was
only
one
item
any
commentator
talked
about
now
the
comet
ken
wondered
how
they
could
get
away
with
a
repetition
of
the
same
thing
over
and
over
but
they
seemed
able
to
get
an
audience
as
long
as
they
kept
the
proper
tone
of
in
their
voices
as
his
hand
touched
the
dial
to
switch
it
off
something
new
caught
ken
attention
a
curious
story
is
coming
in
from
all
parts
of
the
country
this
morning
the
announcer
said
auto
mechanics
are
reporting
a
sudden
unusually
brisk
business
no
one
knows
the
reason
but
there
seems
to
be
a
virtual
epidemic
of
car
breakdowns
some
garagemen
are
said
to
be
blaming
new
additives
in
gasoline
and
lubricating
oil
it
is
reported
that
one
major
oil
company
is
undertaking
an
investigation
of
these
charges
but
in
the
meantime
no
one
really
seems
to
have
a
good
answer
in
connection
with
the
comet
however
from
widely
scattered
areas
comes
the
report
that
people
are
even
blaming
these
engine
failures
on
our
poor
old
comet
in
the
middle
ages
they
blamed
comets
for
everything
from
soured
cream
to
fallen
kingdoms
maybe
this
modern
age
is
so
different
after
all
at
any
rate
this
comet
will
no
doubt
be
happy
to
get
back
into
open
space
where
there
are
no
earthmen
to
blame
it
for
all
their
accidents
and
shortcomings
ken
switched
off
the
radio
and
lay
back
on
the
pillow
that
was
a
real
choice
one
blaming
the
comet
for
car
breakdowns
page
granny
wicks
the
breakdowns
were
curious
however
there
was
no
good
reason
why
there
should
be
a
sudden
rash
of
them
he
wondered
if
they
had
actually
occurred
or
if
the
story
was
just
the
work
of
some
reporter
trying
to
make
something
out
of
his
own
inability
to
get
into
a
couple
of
garages
that
were
swamped
by
the
usual
weekend
rush
this
was
most
likely
the
case
however
it
did
explain
why
his
own
car
had
suddenly
conked
out
ken
thought
irritably
he
have
to
get
it
over
to
art
matthews
garage
as
soon
as
school
was
out
at
school
that
morning
there
was
little
talk
of
anything
but
the
comet
after
physics
class
ken
was
met
by
joe
walton
and
three
other
members
of
the
science
club
of
which
ken
was
president
we
want
a
special
meeting
said
joe
we
just
had
the
most
brilliant
brainstorm
of
our
brief
careers
it
had
better
be
more
brilliant
than
the
last
one
said
ken
that
drained
the
club
treasury
of
its
last
peso
i
was
watching
the
comet
last
night
and
i
began
to
smell
the
dust
of
its
tail
as
the
earth
moved
into
it
you
must
have
been
smelling
something
a
lot
more
powerful
than
comet
dust
i
said
to
myself
why
do
we
collect
some
of
that
stuff
and
bottle
it
and
see
what
it
made
of
what
do
you
think
joe
asked
eagerly
ken
scowled
just
how
many
molecules
of
material
from
the
comet
tail
do
you
think
there
are
in
the
atmosphere
over
mayfield
right
now
how
do
i
know
six
maybe
eight
ken
laughed
you
crazy
anyway
what
have
you
got
in
mind
i
not
sure
joe
answered
seriously
we
know
the
comet
tail
is
so
rarefied
that
it
resembles
a
pretty
fair
vacuum
but
it
composed
of
something
as
it
mixes
with
the
atmosphere
we
ought
to
be
able
to
determine
the
changing
makeup
of
the
air
and
get
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
composition
of
the
comet
tail
this
is
a
chance
nobody
ever
had
before
and
maybe
never
will
again
until
we
go
right
out
there
in
spaceships
being
right
inside
a
comet
tail
long
enough
to
analyze
it
it
sounds
like
a
terrific
project
ken
admitted
the
universities
will
all
be
doing
it
of
course
but
it
would
still
be
a
neat
trick
if
we
could
bring
it
off
maybe
dad
and
professor
larsen
will
have
ideas
on
how
we
could
do
it
we
ought
to
be
able
to
make
most
of
the
equipment
said
joe
so
it
should
be
too
expensive
anyway
we
have
a
meeting
then
right
after
school
yes
no
wait
the
engine
in
my
car
conked
out
i
got
to
go
over
to
art
with
it
this
afternoon
you
go
ahead
without
me
kick
the
idea
around
and
let
me
know
what
decided
i
go
along
with
anything
short
of
mortgaging
the
football
field
okay
said
joe
i
do
see
why
you
do
just
sell
that
hunk
of
junk
and
get
a
real
automobile
you
got
a
good
excuse
now
this
breakdown
is
a
good
omen
do
talk
to
me
about
omens
art
matthews
had
the
best
equipped
garage
in
town
and
was
a
sort
of
unofficial
godfather
to
all
the
in
the
county
he
helped
them
plane
the
heads
of
their
cars
he
got
their
special
cams
and
carburetor
and
manifold
assemblies
wholesale
and
he
gave
them
fatherly
advice
about
using
their
heads
when
they
were
behind
the
wheel
ken
called
him
at
noon
i
got
troubles
art
he
said
can
i
bring
the
car
over
after
school
i
afraid
i
ca
do
a
thing
for
you
today
art
matthews
said
i
do
know
what
happened
but
i
had
tow
calls
all
day
right
now
the
shop
is
full
and
they
stacked
outside
i
going
to
do
a
couple
of
highway
patrol
cars
and
doc
adams
i
figured
they
ought
to
have
priority
ken
felt
a
sudden
uneasy
sense
of
recognition
this
was
the
same
kind
of
thing
he
had
heard
about
on
the
radio
that
morning
a
rash
of
car
breakdowns
all
over
the
country
now
the
same
thing
in
mayfield
what
wrong
with
them
he
asked
the
mechanic
why
is
everybody
coming
in
with
trouble
at
the
same
time
they
not
coming
in
said
art
i
having
to
go
out
after
them
i
do
know
yet
what
wrong
they
heat
up
and
stall
it
the
craziest
thing
i
run
into
in
years
of
garage
work
mine
acted
the
same
way
ken
said
yeah
well
you
in
good
company
listen
why
do
you
and
maybe
joe
and
al
come
down
and
give
me
a
hand
after
school
i
never
get
on
top
here
without
some
help
after
we
get
these
police
and
other
priority
cars
out
of
the
way
maybe
we
can
get
a
quick
look
at
what
wrong
with
yours
it
a
deal
joe
walton
was
much
in
favor
of
spending
that
afternoon
and
an
unknown
number
of
others
in
art
garage
he
was
too
overwhelmed
by
the
idea
of
analyzing
the
material
of
the
comet
tail
however
art
had
done
all
of
them
too
many
favors
in
the
past
to
ignore
his
call
for
help
the
trouble
with
this
town
joe
said
is
that
of
the
automobiles
running
around
the
streets
belong
down
at
thompson
auto
wrecking
al
miner
agreed
to
come
too
when
they
reached
the
garage
after
school
they
saw
art
had
not
been
exaggerating
his
place
was
surrounded
by
stalled
cars
and
the
street
outside
was
lined
with
them
in
both
directions
ken
borrowed
the
tow
truck
and
brought
his
own
car
back
from
the
larsens
by
that
time
the
other
two
boys
were
at
work
batteries
are
all
okay
art
told
him
some
of
these
engines
will
turn
over
but
most
of
them
wo
budge
i
jerked
a
couple
of
heads
but
i
ca
see
anything
i
want
you
to
take
the
pans
off
and
take
down
the
bearings
to
see
if
they
frozen
that
what
they
act
like
when
that
done
we
take
it
from
there
ken
hoisted
the
front
end
of
one
of
the
police
cars
and
slid
under
it
on
a
creeper
art
electric
impact
wrenches
were
all
in
use
so
he
began
the
laborious
removal
of
the
pan
bolts
by
hand
he
had
scarcely
started
when
he
heard
a
yell
from
joe
who
was
beneath
the
other
police
car
what
the
matter
art
called
come
here
look
at
this
the
others
crowded
around
peering
under
the
car
joe
banged
and
pried
at
one
of
the
bearings
still
clinging
to
the
crankshaft
after
the
cap
had
been
removed
do
do
that
art
shouted
at
him
you
jimmy
up
the
crankshaft
matthews
joe
said
solemnly
this
here
crankshaft
has
been
jimmied
up
just
as
much
as
it
ever
going
to
get
jimmied
these
bearings
are
welded
solid
they
have
to
be
machined
off
nothing
could
freeze
them
to
the
shaft
that
hard
art
exclaimed
joe
moved
out
of
the
way
art
crawled
under
and
tapped
the
bearing
he
pried
at
it
with
a
chisel
then
he
applied
a
cold
chisel
and
pounded
the
bearing
metal
came
away
chip
by
chip
but
the
bulk
of
it
clung
to
the
shaft
as
if
welded
i
never
seen
anything
like
that
before
in
my
life
art
came
out
from
beneath
the
car
what
do
you
think
could
cause
it
joe
asked
gas
said
art
vehemently
the
awful
gas
they
putting
out
these
days
they
put
everything
into
it
except
sulphur
and
molasses
and
they
expect
an
engine
to
run
additives
they
call
detergents
why
they
sell
us
plain
old
gasoline
ken
watched
from
a
distance
behind
the
group
he
looked
at
the
silent
motionless
cars
in
uneasy
speculation
he
recalled
again
the
radio
announcement
of
that
morning
maybe
it
be
something
they
were
adding
to
the
gas
or
oil
as
art
said
it
could
however
happen
so
suddenly
not
all
over
the
country
not
in
new
york
montgomery
alabama
san
francisco
and
mayfield
not
all
at
the
same
time
art
turned
up
the
shop
lights
outside
as
the
sun
lowered
in
the
sky
the
glow
of
the
comet
began
turning
the
landscape
a
hue
its
light
came
through
the
broad
doors
of
the
garage
and
spread
over
the
cars
all
right
let
go
said
art
his
voice
held
a
kind
of
false
cheeriness
as
if
something
far
beyond
his
comprehension
had
passed
before
him
and
he
was
at
a
loss
to
meet
it
or
even
understand
it
let
go
he
said
again
loosen
all
those
connecting
rods
and
get
the
shafts
out
we
see
what
happens
when
we
try
to
pull
the
pistons
chapter
the
news
broadcasts
the
following
morning
were
less
hysterical
than
previously
because
the
news
itself
was
far
more
serious
the
announcers
found
it
unnecessary
to
inject
artificial
notes
of
urgency
ken
listened
to
his
bedside
radio
as
he
watched
the
first
tint
of
dawn
above
the
hills
east
of
the
valley
the
flurry
of
mechanical
failures
which
was
reported
yesterday
has
reached
alarming
proportions
the
announcer
said
during
the
past
hours
garages
in
every
section
of
the
nation
have
been
flooded
with
calls
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
reports
indicate
the
existence
of
a
similar
situation
in
europe
and
in
the
british
isles
automobile
breakdowns
are
not
the
most
serious
accidents
that
are
taking
place
other
forms
of
machinery
are
also
being
affected
a
crack
train
of
the
southern
pacific
came
to
a
halt
last
night
in
the
arizona
desert
all
efforts
of
the
crew
to
repair
the
stalled
engine
were
fruitless
a
new
one
had
to
be
brought
up
in
order
for
the
passengers
to
continue
on
their
way
early
this
morning
from
las
vegas
comes
word
that
one
of
the
huge
generators
at
hoover
dam
has
been
taken
out
of
service
because
of
mechanical
failure
three
other
large
municipalities
have
had
similar
service
interruptions
these
are
rochester
new
york
clinton
missouri
and
bakersfield
california
attempts
have
been
made
to
find
some
authoritative
comment
on
the
situation
from
scientists
and
government
officials
so
far
no
one
has
been
willing
to
commit
himself
to
an
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
this
unexplained
and
dangerously
growing
phenomenon
yesterday
it
was
jokingly
whispered
that
the
comet
was
responsible
today
although
no
authority
can
be
found
to
verify
it
the
rumor
persists
that
leading
scientists
are
seriously
considering
the
possibility
that
the
comet
may
actually
have
something
to
do
with
the
breakdowns
ken
turned
off
the
radio
and
lay
back
with
his
hands
beneath
his
head
staring
at
the
ceiling
his
first
impulse
was
to
ridicule
again
this
fantastic
idea
about
the
comet
yet
there
had
to
be
explanation
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
engines
in
art
garage
last
night
to
know
they
had
suffered
no
ordinary
mechanical
disorder
something
had
happened
to
them
that
had
never
happened
to
engines
before
as
far
as
he
knew
the
crankshafts
were
immovable
in
their
bearings
the
pistons
had
been
frozen
tight
in
the
cylinders
when
they
tried
to
remove
some
of
them
every
moving
part
was
welded
to
its
mating
piece
as
solidly
as
if
the
whole
engine
had
been
heated
to
the
very
edge
of
melting
and
then
allowed
to
cool
apparently
something
similar
was
happening
to
engines
in
every
part
of
the
world
it
could
only
mean
that
some
common
factor
was
at
work
in
london
and
paris
and
cairo
and
mayfield
the
only
such
factor
newly
invading
the
environment
of
every
city
on
the
globe
was
the
comet
it
would
almost
require
a
belief
in
witchcraft
to
admit
the
comet
might
be
responsible
ken
arose
and
dressed
slowly
by
the
time
he
was
finished
he
heard
his
father
call
to
breakfast
from
downstairs
professor
maddox
was
already
seated
when
ken
entered
the
dining
room
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
with
an
appearance
of
intense
absorption
in
everything
about
him
he
glanced
up
and
nodded
a
pleasant
good
morning
as
ken
approached
i
hear
you
worked
overtime
as
an
auto
mechanic
last
night
he
said
is
that
a
bit
rough
along
with
the
load
you
carrying
at
school
art
asked
us
to
do
him
a
favor
have
you
seen
what
been
happening
around
town
i
noticed
an
unusual
number
of
cars
around
the
garage
and
i
wondered
about
it
has
everyone
decided
to
take
care
of
their
winter
repairs
at
the
same
time
have
you
heard
the
radio
either
dad
no
i
been
working
on
my
new
paper
for
the
until
midnight
for
the
last
week
what
has
the
radio
got
to
do
with
your
work
as
a
mechanic
quickly
ken
outlined
to
his
father
the
events
he
had
heard
reported
the
past
two
days
it
not
only
automobiles
but
trains
power
plants
ships
everything
professor
maddox
looked
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
ken
was
not
joking
that
would
certainly
be
a
strange
set
of
coincidences
he
said
finally
provided
the
reports
are
true
of
course
it
true
all
right
said
ken
it
not
a
matter
of
coincidence
something
is
causing
it
to
happen
what
could
that
possibly
be
there
talk
about
the
comet
having
something
to
do
with
it
professor
maddox
almost
choked
on
his
spoonful
of
cereal
ken
he
laughed
finally
i
thought
you
were
such
a
stickler
for
rigid
scientific
methods
and
hypotheses
what
happened
to
all
your
rigor
ken
looked
down
at
the
tablecloth
i
know
it
sounds
ridiculous
like
something
out
of
the
dim
past
when
they
blamed
comets
for
corns
and
broken
legs
and
lost
battles
maybe
this
time
it
is
so
crazy
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it
and
it
absolutely
the
only
new
factor
which
could
have
some
worldwide
effect
how
could
it
have
any
effect
at
all
worldwide
or
otherwise
professor
maddox
demanded
the
whole
world
is
immersed
in
its
tail
and
that
tail
is
so
tenuous
that
our
senses
do
not
even
detect
the
fact
that
does
mean
it
could
have
some
kind
of
effect
such
as
stopping
engines
well
you
a
pretty
good
mechanic
just
what
did
the
comet
do
to
all
these
stalled
pieces
of
machinery
ken
felt
his
father
was
being
unfair
yet
he
could
scarcely
blame
him
for
not
taking
the
hypothesis
seriously
i
do
know
what
the
comet
did
or
could
do
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
just
know
i
never
seen
any
engines
like
those
we
took
apart
last
night
in
detail
he
described
to
his
father
the
appearance
of
the
engine
parts
they
had
dismantled
i
brought
home
some
samples
of
metal
we
cut
from
the
engine
blocks
with
a
torch
would
you
take
them
up
to
the
laboratory
at
the
college
and
have
them
examined
under
the
electron
microscope
i
would
have
time
to
run
any
such
tests
for
several
days
if
you
are
intent
on
pursuing
this
thing
however
i
tell
you
what
i
do
you
and
your
science
club
friends
can
come
up
and
use
the
equipment
yourselves
we
do
know
how
i
arrange
for
one
of
the
teaching
fellows
to
show
you
how
to
prepare
metallic
samples
and
operate
the
electron
microscope
ken
eyes
lighted
gee
that
would
be
great
if
you
would
do
that
dad
will
you
really
come
around
after
school
today
i
see
that
someone
is
there
to
help
you
art
matthews
was
disappointed
when
ken
called
and
said
none
of
the
science
club
members
would
be
around
that
afternoon
he
could
keep
from
showing
in
his
voice
that
he
felt
they
were
letting
him
down
it
not
any
use
trying
to
get
those
engines
running
ken
said
the
pistons
would
never
come
out
of
most
of
them
without
being
drilled
out
we
not
equipped
for
that
even
if
we
got
things
loosened
up
and
running
again
what
would
keep
the
same
thing
from
happening
again
that
what
we
got
to
find
out
art
was
unable
to
accept
this
point
of
view
he
held
a
bewildered
but
insistent
belief
that
something
ought
to
be
done
about
the
mounting
pile
of
disabled
cars
outside
his
garage
we
can
get
some
of
them
going
ken
you
fellows
have
got
to
lend
a
hand
i
ca
tackle
it
without
help
i
sorry
ken
said
we
convinced
there
got
to
be
another
way
to
get
at
the
problem
all
right
you
guys
do
whatever
you
figure
you
got
to
do
i
can
probably
round
up
some
other
help
ken
hung
up
wishing
he
had
been
able
to
make
art
understand
but
the
mechanic
would
probably
be
the
last
person
in
mayfield
to
accept
that
the
comet
could
have
any
possible
connection
with
the
frozen
engines
as
ken
walked
to
school
that
morning
he
estimated
that
at
least
percent
of
the
cars
in
mayfield
must
be
out
of
commission
some
of
the
men
in
his
neighborhood
were
in
their
driveways
futilely
punching
their
starters
while
their
engines
moaned
protestingly
or
refused
to
turn
over
at
all
others
were
peering
under
the
hoods
shaking
their
heads
and
calling
across
the
yards
to
their
neighbors
in
the
street
some
cars
were
lugging
with
great
difficulty
but
others
moved
swiftly
along
without
any
evidence
of
trouble
ken
wondered
how
there
could
be
such
a
difference
and
if
some
might
prove
immune
so
to
speak
to
the
effect
he
had
called
a
meeting
of
the
club
in
the
chemistry
laboratory
for
an
hour
before
the
first
class
all
of
the
members
were
there
when
he
arrived
ken
called
the
meeting
to
order
at
once
i
guess
you
all
heard
the
news
broadcasts
and
you
know
what
happening
here
in
town
he
said
yesterday
you
talked
about
the
possibility
of
collecting
samples
and
analyzing
the
material
of
the
comet
tail
i
do
know
what
you
decided
you
can
fill
me
in
later
on
that
the
problem
is
a
lot
more
important
now
than
it
was
yesterday
it
beginning
to
seem
as
if
the
presence
of
the
comet
may
actually
be
responsible
for
the
wave
of
mechanical
failures
finding
out
how
and
why
is
just
about
the
biggest
problem
in
the
whole
world
right
now
a
babble
of
exclamations
and
protests
arose
immediately
from
the
other
members
of
the
group
al
miner
and
dave
whitaker
were
on
their
feet
ted
watkins
waved
a
hand
and
shouted
do
tell
us
you
swallowing
that
superstitious
junk
ken
held
up
a
hand
one
at
a
time
we
have
got
all
day
and
a
lot
of
ground
to
cover
ted
what
your
comment
my
comment
is
that
anybody
got
a
screw
loose
if
he
believes
the
comet
got
anything
to
do
with
all
those
cars
being
in
art
garage
that
stuff
went
out
of
fashion
after
the
days
of
old
salem
several
of
the
others
nodded
vigorously
as
ted
spoke
i
guess
we
do
need
to
bring
some
of
you
up
to
date
on
the
background
material
said
ken
joe
tell
them
what
we
found
last
night
briefly
joe
walton
described
the
engines
they
had
dismantled
something
had
happened
to
them
he
said
which
had
never
happened
to
an
engine
since
ford
drove
his
first
horseless
carriage
down
main
street
it
does
mean
anything
exclaimed
ted
no
matter
what
it
is
we
have
any
basis
for
tying
it
to
the
comet
can
you
name
any
other
universal
factor
that
could
account
for
it
ken
asked
we
have
an
effect
that
appears
suddenly
in
mayfield
chicago
paris
and
cairo
some
people
say
it
the
additives
in
gasoline
but
you
do
get
them
showing
up
simultaneously
in
all
parts
of
the
world
there
is
no
other
factor
common
to
every
locality
where
the
mechanical
failures
have
occurred
except
the
comet
so
i
called
this
meeting
to
suggest
that
we
expand
our
project
beyond
anything
we
previously
had
in
mind
i
suggest
we
try
to
determine
the
exact
relationship
between
the
breakdowns
and
the
appearance
of
the
comet
big
dave
whitaker
sitting
at
the
edge
of
the
room
rose
slowly
in
his
seat
you
got
the
cart
before
the
horse
he
said
you
got
a
nice
theory
all
set
up
and
you
want
us
to
beat
our
brains
out
trying
to
prove
it
now
take
me
i
got
a
theory
that
little
green
men
from
mars
have
landed
and
are
being
sucked
into
the
air
intake
of
the
engines
prove
my
theory
first
why
do
you
ken
grinned
i
stand
corrected
but
i
wo
back
down
very
far
i
wo
suggest
we
try
to
prove
the
connection
with
the
comet
but
i
do
propose
to
set
up
some
experiments
to
discover
if
there
is
any
relationship
if
there
is
then
what
it
is
does
that
suit
you
i
go
along
with
that
how
do
you
propose
to
go
about
it
let
find
out
where
the
rest
stand
said
ken
how
about
it
you
guys
i
go
for
it
said
ted
as
long
as
we
are
out
to
prove
a
medieval
superstition
one
by
one
the
others
nodded
agreement
joe
walton
said
intensely
we
find
out
whether
it
superstition
or
not
there
no
other
possible
cause
and
we
prove
it
before
we
through
ken
smiled
and
waved
him
down
we
working
on
a
hypothesis
only
anyway
here
what
i
have
to
suggest
by
way
of
procedure
since
the
tail
of
the
comet
is
so
rarefied
there
are
many
molecules
of
it
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
entire
valley
i
do
know
just
what
the
mathematical
chances
of
getting
a
measurable
sample
are
maybe
you
can
work
out
some
figures
on
it
dave
we
have
to
handle
an
enormous
volume
of
air
so
let
get
a
blower
as
large
as
we
can
get
our
hands
on
and
funnel
the
air
through
some
electrically
charged
filters
we
can
wash
down
these
filters
with
a
solvent
of
some
kind
periodically
and
distill
whatever
has
collected
on
them
you
wo
get
enough
to
fill
the
left
eye
of
a
virus
suffering
from
arrested
development
said
ted
we
find
out
when
we
get
set
up
said
ken
my
father
has
agreed
to
give
us
access
to
the
electron
microscope
at
the
college
maybe
we
can
use
their
new
mass
spectrograph
to
help
analyze
whatever
we
collect
if
we
knew
how
to
use
a
mass
spectrograph
said
ted
he
offered
to
let
one
of
the
teaching
fellows
help
us
what
will
all
this
prove
even
if
we
do
find
something
dave
asked
you
get
all
kinds
of
lines
from
a
spectrogram
of
atmospheric
dust
so
what
if
we
should
get
some
lines
that
we
ca
identify
and
if
we
should
get
those
same
lines
from
metallic
specimens
taken
from
the
disabled
engines
we
would
have
evidence
of
the
presence
of
a
new
factor
then
we
could
proceed
with
a
determination
of
what
effect
if
any
this
factor
has
on
the
engines
ken
looked
around
the
group
once
more
any
comments
suggestions
arguments
there
being
none
we
consider
the
project
approved
and
get
to
work
this
afternoon
as
they
left
to
go
to
their
first
classes
ted
shook
his
head
gloomily
man
you
do
know
what
you
biting
off
all
we
done
so
far
is
build
a
few
ham
radios
a
telescope
and
some
geiger
counters
talking
about
precision
work
now
and
i
mean
throughout
the
day
ken
too
felt
increasing
doubts
about
their
ability
to
carry
off
the
project
it
would
be
a
task
of
tremendous
delicacy
to
analyze
such
microscopic
samples
as
they
might
succeed
in
obtaining
microchemical
methods
would
be
necessary
and
none
of
them
had
had
any
experience
in
that
field
his
father
was
an
expert
with
these
methods
and
though
he
might
scold
them
for
tackling
such
a
difficult
project
he
help
them
ken
thought
he
always
had
this
was
no
ordinary
project
however
ken
had
no
idea
how
seriously
scientists
in
general
were
considering
the
comet
as
the
offender
but
certainly
they
must
be
working
frantically
on
the
problem
of
the
mechanical
disorder
unless
they
found
another
cause
very
soon
they
were
certain
to
turn
to
an
analysis
of
the
comet
tail
it
would
be
very
satisfying
if
ken
group
could
actually
be
in
the
vanguard
of
such
a
development
he
tried
to
ridicule
his
own
conviction
that
the
comet
held
the
key
he
had
no
reason
whatever
for
such
a
belief
except
the
fact
of
the
universal
presence
how
it
could
stop
an
automobile
engine
or
a
railroad
train
was
beyond
his
wildest
imaginings
but
there
was
nothing
else
nothing
at
all
on
the
way
home
after
school
there
seemed
to
ken
to
be
a
subtle
change
that
had
come
over
the
valley
since
morning
along
the
streets
cars
were
parked
in
front
of
houses
to
which
they
did
not
belong
little
knots
of
people
were
standing
about
talking
in
hushed
tones
the
comet
was
aflame
in
the
sky
there
seemed
to
be
not
merely
an
awe
and
an
uneasiness
in
the
people
but
a
genuine
fear
that
ken
could
not
help
absorbing
as
he
moved
past
them
on
the
sidewalks
their
faces
were
yellow
and
flat
under
the
glare
of
the
comet
and
they
looked
at
him
and
at
each
other
as
if
they
were
strangers
in
an
alien
land
almost
without
being
aware
of
it
ken
found
himself
running
the
last
before
he
reached
his
own
home
he
burst
in
the
door
and
called
out
with
forced
cheeriness
hi
mom
what
cooking
starved
the
whole
gang
coming
over
in
a
few
minutes
i
hope
got
something
for
them
his
mother
came
out
of
the
kitchen
her
face
gray
with
uncertainty
you
have
to
do
with
sandwiches
this
afternoon
she
said
i
been
able
to
use
the
electric
stove
since
noon
ken
stared
at
her
there
something
about
the
power
she
went
on
we
have
any
lights
either
they
say
the
power
station
at
collin
dam
went
out
of
commission
this
morning
they
do
know
when
they
be
able
to
get
it
back
on
chapter
while
he
stood
shocked
by
his
mother
statement
ken
heard
the
phone
ringing
in
the
next
room
on
battery
power
at
the
telephone
central
office
he
thought
his
mother
answered
and
there
was
a
pause
professor
maddox
is
at
the
college
she
said
you
can
probably
reach
him
there
or
i
can
give
him
your
message
when
he
comes
home
she
returned
to
the
doorway
that
was
the
power
company
they
want
your
father
and
douglas
to
have
a
look
at
their
generators
ken
what
do
you
think
this
means
she
asked
worriedly
what
will
happen
if
all
our
power
goes
off
and
does
come
back
on
do
you
think
your
father
has
any
idea
what
causing
the
trouble
ken
shook
his
head
i
do
know
mom
so
far
nobody
seems
to
know
anything
in
less
than
minutes
professor
maddox
hurried
into
the
house
could
get
my
car
going
he
said
it
stalled
on
the
campus
parking
lot
the
power
company
wants
me
to
go
to
collin
dam
i
know
said
maddox
they
called
here
he
paused
a
moment
staring
out
the
window
a
look
of
bewilderment
on
his
face
this
thing
seems
to
be
more
serious
than
i
would
have
believed
possible
there
just
no
explanation
for
it
none
at
all
any
chance
of
my
going
along
dad
ken
said
i
afraid
not
we
going
in
larsen
car
and
it
half
loaded
with
instruments
i
hope
we
make
it
there
and
back
without
breaking
down
i
probably
be
back
early
this
evening
but
do
hold
dinner
on
my
account
there
will
be
only
sandwiches
said
ken
mother
i
ca
cook
anything
of
course
just
leave
me
some
of
whatever
you
have
from
the
doorway
ken
watched
his
father
and
the
other
two
scientists
he
thought
he
detected
a
loginess
in
the
engine
as
professor
larsen
drove
away
from
the
curb
what
they
hoped
to
accomplish
ken
did
know
but
he
felt
certain
they
would
find
the
same
thing
in
the
generators
that
had
been
found
in
the
automobile
engines
the
bearings
were
probably
frozen
so
tight
that
they
and
the
shaft
had
become
one
solid
piece
of
metal
he
hoped
the
scientists
would
bring
back
some
samples
of
the
metal
by
all
the
members
of
the
science
club
had
arrived
they
met
in
what
ken
called
his
science
shack
a
small
building
next
to
the
observatory
here
he
kept
the
amateur
radio
equipment
belonging
to
the
club
and
his
own
personal
collections
in
the
several
different
fields
in
which
he
had
been
interested
since
his
boy
scout
days
in
each
of
his
companions
ken
could
see
the
effect
of
the
feeling
that
now
pervaded
the
town
their
usual
horseplay
was
almost
forgotten
and
their
faces
were
sober
to
the
point
of
fear
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
run
our
blower
by
electricity
said
joe
walton
we
ca
even
get
power
for
the
precipitating
filters
let
scrounge
anything
we
can
find
that
runs
on
gasoline
or
coal
oil
said
al
miner
if
we
act
fast
we
ought
to
be
able
to
pick
up
some
old
motorcycle
engines
or
some
power
lawn
mowers
from
the
dump
have
probably
got
some
we
can
try
people
basements
too
let
get
as
many
as
possible
because
we
do
know
how
long
any
one
will
last
and
we
may
have
to
run
the
blower
for
weeks
in
order
to
get
any
kind
of
sample
good
idea
said
ken
here
something
else
who
got
a
car
left
to
gather
this
stuff
in
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
ours
was
still
running
this
morning
frank
abrams
said
but
i
guarantee
how
long
we
can
count
on
it
pretty
soon
there
wo
be
any
we
can
count
on
we
got
to
get
a
horse
and
wagon
before
they
start
selling
for
as
much
as
a
new
cadillac
used
to
my
uncle
got
one
on
his
farm
said
dave
whitaker
he
would
probably
loan
it
to
me
but
he
five
miles
out
of
town
take
my
bike
said
ken
see
if
he
let
you
borrow
it
and
a
wagon
for
at
least
a
couple
of
weeks
or
longer
bring
some
bales
of
hay
too
right
now
right
now
when
dave
had
gone
al
said
what
about
the
blower
anybody
know
where
we
can
get
one
of
those
i
think
there
one
at
thompson
said
ted
they
pulled
it
out
of
pete
and
mary
restaurant
when
they
remodeled
that
would
be
just
a
little
kitchen
blower
not
big
enough
we
need
a
one
ken
said
after
a
long
pause
there
is
one
in
town
the
chances
of
getting
one
from
somewhere
else
are
practically
zero
frederick
is
miles
away
and
by
tomorrow
there
may
not
be
a
car
in
town
that
would
go
that
far
look
said
al
how
about
the
systems
in
town
there
is
one
that
any
good
where
it
is
now
both
the
high
school
and
the
college
have
big
ones
i
bet
we
could
get
permission
at
either
place
to
revamp
the
intake
and
outlet
ducts
so
we
could
put
in
our
filters
and
precipitators
your
father
and
his
friends
could
swing
it
for
us
at
the
college
you
might
be
right
it
worth
trying
for
precipitators
we
can
rig
a
system
that
will
put
a
few
thousand
volts
on
the
screens
art
will
let
us
have
enough
car
batteries
for
that
i
think
we
set
dave
whitaker
did
not
return
until
dusk
but
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
horse
and
wagon
and
a
load
of
hay
he
deposited
this
in
his
own
yard
before
driving
back
to
ken
place
during
the
next
two
or
three
hours
the
boys
found
two
old
motorcycle
engines
a
power
motor
and
one
old
washing
machine
all
of
these
they
took
down
to
art
matthews
place
and
begged
him
for
space
and
tools
to
overhaul
the
equipment
you
can
have
the
whole
joint
art
said
dejectedly
this
pile
of
junk
will
never
move
he
waved
a
hand
at
the
cars
lined
up
and
down
both
sides
of
the
streets
near
his
place
by
they
had
succeeded
in
getting
all
of
the
small
engines
running
but
they
dared
not
test
them
too
long
hoping
to
conserve
all
possible
life
that
might
be
left
when
they
were
through
they
returned
to
ken
house
maddox
had
sandwiches
ready
for
them
no
word
had
been
heard
from
the
three
scientists
who
had
gone
to
the
power
plant
maria
called
anxious
about
her
father
i
worried
ken
she
said
what
would
happen
to
them
out
there
if
the
car
breaks
down
and
they
have
no
place
to
go
they
be
all
right
ken
reassured
her
they
probably
found
something
bigger
than
they
expected
at
the
dam
if
they
should
have
trouble
with
the
car
they
can
find
a
phone
along
the
road
at
some
farmhouse
and
let
us
know
i
ca
help
worrying
said
maria
everything
feels
so
strange
tonight
just
the
way
it
does
before
a
big
thunderstorm
as
if
something
terrible
were
going
to
happen
ken
sensed
the
way
she
felt
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
hold
back
the
same
reaction
within
himself
but
he
knew
it
must
be
far
more
difficult
for
maria
being
in
a
foreign
country
among
strangers
with
customs
she
did
understand
why
do
you
and
your
mother
come
over
here
until
they
get
back
he
asked
suppose
they
do
come
back
at
all
tonight
i
mean
then
you
can
sleep
here
mom
got
plenty
of
room
i
ask
mamma
if
it
all
right
with
her
we
be
right
over
ken
hoped
they
would
come
he
found
himself
concerned
beyond
all
reason
that
maria
and
her
mother
should
be
made
comfortable
and
relieved
of
their
worries
he
went
out
to
the
backyard
again
where
all
the
other
members
of
the
club
were
still
lounging
on
the
grass
watching
the
sky
the
comet
was
twenty
degrees
above
the
horizon
although
the
sun
had
long
since
set
below
the
western
mountains
no
one
seemed
to
feel
this
was
a
night
for
sleeping
let
try
your
battery
portable
for
a
few
minutes
said
joe
walton
i
like
to
know
what
going
on
in
the
rest
of
the
world
ken
brought
it
out
and
turned
it
on
the
local
station
was
off
the
air
of
course
and
so
was
the
one
in
frederick
half
the
power
there
came
from
the
collin
dam
more
than
of
the
usual
stations
were
missing
but
ken
finally
picked
up
one
coming
in
clearly
from
the
northern
tip
of
the
state
the
announcer
did
sound
like
an
announcer
he
sounded
like
an
ordinary
man
in
the
midst
of
a
great
and
personal
tragedy
over
of
the
cars
in
the
united
states
he
was
saying
are
now
estimated
to
be
out
of
commission
the
truck
transportation
system
of
the
country
has
all
but
broken
down
the
railroads
have
likewise
suffered
from
this
unbelievable
phenomenon
all
machinery
which
involves
rolling
or
sliding
contact
between
metal
parts
has
been
more
or
less
affected
those
equipped
with
roller
bearings
are
holding
up
longer
than
those
equipped
with
bushings
but
all
are
gradually
failing
in
new
york
city
half
the
power
capacity
has
gone
out
of
commission
some
emergency
units
have
been
thrown
into
operation
but
these
can
not
carry
the
load
and
even
some
of
them
have
failed
elsewhere
across
the
nation
the
story
is
similar
in
chicago
kansas
city
louis
washington
san
francisco
the
power
systems
are
breaking
down
along
with
motor
and
rail
transportation
for
some
hours
now
the
president
and
his
cabinet
have
been
in
session
with
dozens
of
scientific
leaders
trying
to
find
an
explanation
and
a
cure
for
this
disastrous
failure
of
machinery
rumors
which
were
broadcast
widely
this
morning
concerning
possible
effects
of
the
comet
have
been
thoroughly
discredited
by
these
scientists
who
call
them
superstitions
belonging
back
in
the
middle
ages
one
final
report
has
just
come
over
the
air
by
shortwave
in
the
atlantic
ocean
the
italian
steamer
has
radioed
frantically
that
her
engines
are
dead
over
eight
hundred
passengers
and
crew
are
aboard
all
ship
sailings
have
been
canceled
since
noon
today
vessels
at
sea
are
returning
to
nearest
port
there
is
no
ship
available
which
can
take
off
the
stranded
passengers
and
crew
of
the
she
floats
helpless
and
alone
tonight
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
ocean
as
a
measure
broadcasting
on
this
network
will
cease
until
midnight
eastern
standard
time
turn
your
radios
off
keep
all
unnecessary
lights
off
avoid
consumption
of
power
in
every
possible
way
be
with
us
again
at
midnight
for
the
latest
news
and
information
there
was
a
restlessness
in
all
of
mayfield
none
of
the
townspeople
felt
like
sleeping
that
night
ken
group
watched
the
comet
until
it
disappeared
below
the
horizon
some
of
them
observed
it
through
the
telescope
on
either
side
of
the
maddoxes
yard
the
voices
of
neighbors
could
be
heard
under
the
night
sky
speaking
in
hushed
tones
of
the
thing
that
had
happened
maria
and
larsen
arrived
and
maria
joined
ken
and
his
friends
in
the
backyard
he
told
her
what
they
had
heard
on
the
radio
that
ship
maria
said
slowly
the
out
there
alone
in
the
ocean
what
will
become
of
all
those
people
ken
shook
his
head
slowly
there
no
way
to
get
to
them
there
not
a
thing
that
can
be
done
nothing
at
all
they
remained
quiet
for
a
long
time
as
if
each
were
thinking
his
own
thoughts
about
the
mystery
and
loneliness
and
death
riding
the
forsaken
ship
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
and
how
soon
it
might
be
that
the
same
dark
shadow
settled
over
the
cities
and
towns
maria
thought
of
her
homeland
and
the
people
she
knew
suddenly
frightened
and
helpless
in
their
inability
to
get
power
and
food
ken
thought
of
the
scenes
that
must
be
occurring
in
the
big
cities
of
the
united
states
people
everywhere
would
not
be
sleeping
tonight
they
were
all
citizens
of
a
civilization
that
was
dependent
for
its
life
on
turning
wheels
and
on
power
surging
through
bright
wires
across
hundreds
of
miles
of
open
country
without
those
turning
wheels
and
the
power
in
those
wires
there
was
no
food
there
was
no
warmth
there
was
no
life
they
listened
to
the
radio
again
at
midnight
there
was
little
that
was
new
the
president
council
had
found
no
solution
nor
had
they
come
to
any
decisions
scattered
riots
and
public
disorders
were
springing
up
both
in
europe
and
america
on
the
high
seas
the
captain
of
the
was
begging
for
assistance
demanding
to
know
what
had
happened
that
no
ship
could
be
sent
to
his
aid
word
finally
came
from
ken
father
and
his
companions
that
their
car
had
failed
after
leaving
the
dam
to
return
home
they
had
reached
a
farmhouse
where
they
would
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
they
would
try
to
find
some
kind
of
transportation
in
the
morning
in
the
hours
ken
friends
drifted
away
one
by
one
to
their
own
homes
and
as
dawn
approached
ken
finally
went
up
to
his
own
room
and
slept
maria
and
her
mother
with
ken
mother
had
retired
only
a
short
time
earlier
when
he
awoke
at
ken
had
no
idea
whether
or
not
the
school
officials
planned
to
hold
classes
that
day
but
he
felt
that
for
himself
and
the
other
members
of
the
science
club
there
would
be
no
return
to
normal
activity
for
a
long
time
since
his
father
would
not
return
for
an
indefinite
time
ken
determined
to
approach
president
lewis
of
the
college
regarding
the
use
of
the
idle
blower
and
ventilation
ducts
in
the
science
hall
he
had
met
president
lewis
a
number
of
times
and
believed
the
president
would
listen
to
him
another
matter
had
disturbed
ken
since
last
night
as
soon
as
he
was
awake
he
called
the
office
of
mayor
hilliard
the
mayor
secretary
answered
and
said
mayor
hilliard
is
in
conference
he
will
not
be
available
today
ken
hesitated
tell
him
it
is
the
maddox
residence
calling
i
think
mayor
hilliard
will
answer
in
a
moment
the
mayor
voice
boomed
on
the
phone
normally
hearty
it
was
now
weighted
with
overtones
of
uncertainty
and
fear
professor
maddox
i
was
just
about
to
call
you
would
you
this
is
not
professor
maddox
said
ken
i
his
son
kenneth
my
secretary
said
the
mayor
sounded
angry
now
although
he
knew
ken
well
i
did
say
my
father
was
calling
said
ken
i
got
something
to
say
that
i
think
you
will
want
to
hear
and
it
will
take
only
a
minute
all
right
go
ahead
in
a
day
or
two
the
entire
town
is
going
to
be
without
power
transportation
or
communication
with
the
outside
world
the
science
club
of
the
high
school
has
a
amateur
transmitter
that
can
reach
any
point
in
the
united
states
and
most
foreign
countries
it
requires
power
we
can
operate
from
batteries
and
i
would
like
to
ask
you
to
authorize
that
all
automobile
batteries
and
those
belonging
to
the
telephone
company
be
immediately
seized
by
the
city
and
placed
in
official
custody
to
be
used
for
emergency
communication
purposes
only
they
should
be
drained
of
electrolyte
and
properly
stored
i
appreciate
that
suggestion
the
mayor
said
i
think
it
a
good
one
would
you
boys
be
able
to
take
care
of
that
we
be
glad
to
it
your
assignment
then
we
are
calling
a
town
meeting
tonight
in
the
college
auditorium
we
especially
want
your
father
to
be
there
if
he
can
and
we
issue
orders
for
the
battery
conservation
program
at
that
time
by
noon
ken
had
gained
an
interview
with
president
lewis
and
had
received
permission
for
his
group
to
make
use
of
the
largest
blower
on
the
campus
for
their
project
they
loaded
their
tools
and
themselves
into
the
ancient
wagon
belonging
to
dave
whitaker
uncle
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
working
at
science
hall
ken
father
called
again
to
report
they
had
succeeded
in
renting
a
horse
and
buggy
at
an
exorbitant
price
from
a
farmer
when
told
of
the
town
meeting
that
evening
he
promised
to
try
to
reach
mayfield
in
time
ten
minutes
before
the
deadline
professor
maddox
drew
up
in
front
of
the
house
he
called
to
ken
without
even
getting
down
from
the
seat
of
the
wagon
get
your
mother
and
let
go
maddox
appeared
worried
and
concerned
you
had
nothing
to
eat
she
protested
at
least
come
in
and
have
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
milk
it
not
cold
but
it
fresh
no
professor
maddox
shook
his
head
we
do
want
to
miss
any
of
the
meeting
get
a
coat
and
come
along
it
will
be
chilly
later
maria
and
her
mother
came
also
the
small
wagon
was
loaded
to
capacity
as
it
moved
slowly
up
the
hill
toward
the
campus
people
were
streaming
toward
the
auditorium
from
all
directions
most
of
them
were
afoot
a
few
others
had
found
a
horse
and
wagon
a
dozen
or
two
cars
chugged
protestingly
up
the
hill
but
it
appeared
that
most
of
these
would
not
be
operating
another
hours
as
they
approached
the
hall
professor
maddox
chuckled
and
pointed
a
finger
ahead
of
them
look
there
i
sure
that
every
citizen
of
mayfield
is
present
or
accounted
for
now
ken
glanced
in
the
direction
of
his
father
gesture
the
creaky
wagon
of
granny
wicks
was
drawn
slowly
along
by
her
emaciated
horse
body
jounced
harshly
on
the
rough
seat
ken
fought
against
a
ridiculous
uneasiness
as
he
recognized
her
he
knew
his
father
had
not
heard
granny
speech
on
the
post
office
steps
but
he
was
little
surprised
when
his
father
said
i
afraid
granny
wicks
with
her
profound
knowledge
of
omens
and
signs
is
about
as
much
an
authority
on
this
matter
as
any
of
the
rest
of
us
here
tonight
chapter
the
hall
was
already
filled
several
scores
of
chairs
had
been
placed
in
the
corridors
and
these
were
occupied
also
people
were
being
ushered
to
nearby
classrooms
where
they
would
hear
the
proceedings
over
the
school
system
it
looks
as
if
we
have
to
get
it
by
remote
pickup
said
ken
at
that
moment
sally
teasdale
the
mayor
secretary
spotted
their
group
and
hurried
over
mayor
hilliard
told
me
to
watch
for
you
she
said
he
wants
you
to
sit
on
the
platform
professor
maddox
and
also
douglas
and
larsen
the
others
of
your
party
can
sit
in
the
wings
professor
maddox
agreed
and
they
followed
sally
to
the
stage
entrance
the
platform
was
already
occupied
by
the
mayor
and
the
town
councilmen
the
college
department
heads
and
leading
citizens
of
mayfield
the
professors
took
their
places
while
ken
and
the
others
found
chairs
in
the
wings
it
was
the
best
seat
in
the
house
ken
decided
they
could
see
both
the
platform
and
the
audience
below
it
was
undoubtedly
the
largest
group
that
had
ever
gathered
in
one
place
in
mayfield
in
spite
of
the
enormous
number
present
it
was
a
solemn
group
there
was
almost
no
talking
or
jostling
to
ken
it
seemed
the
faces
about
him
had
a
uniform
appearance
of
bewildered
searching
for
reassurance
that
nothing
could
really
destroy
the
way
of
life
they
had
always
known
mayor
hilliard
arose
and
called
the
meeting
to
order
i
think
everyone
knows
why
we
been
called
here
he
said
because
of
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
i
think
it
appropriate
that
we
ask
aylesworth
pastor
of
the
community
church
to
offer
prayer
heads
were
bowed
in
reverent
silence
as
aylesworth
stood
before
the
assembly
and
offered
a
solemn
invocation
that
their
deliberations
might
receive
divine
guidance
and
their
minds
be
filled
with
wisdom
to
combat
the
evil
that
had
come
upon
them
the
minister
was
a
big
man
with
a
lion
mane
of
white
hair
the
unwavering
authority
of
his
voice
filled
the
audience
with
the
conviction
that
they
were
better
prepared
to
face
their
problems
when
he
had
resumed
his
seat
mayor
hilliard
outlined
the
worldwide
situation
as
he
had
obtained
it
through
news
reports
up
to
an
hour
ago
he
described
the
desperate
situation
of
the
nation
larger
cities
their
food
supplies
were
sufficient
for
only
a
few
days
without
any
replenishment
by
rail
and
truck
transportation
ninety
percent
of
automobile
traffic
had
ceased
the
railroads
were
attempting
to
conserve
their
rolling
stock
but
percent
of
it
was
out
of
commission
and
the
remainder
could
not
be
expected
to
operate
longer
than
a
few
days
air
traffic
had
stopped
entirely
on
the
oceans
only
sailing
vessels
continued
to
move
mayfield
is
already
cut
off
the
mayor
went
on
our
last
train
went
through
here
hours
ago
the
trucking
companies
out
of
frederick
have
suspended
operations
we
have
no
cars
or
trucks
of
our
own
here
in
town
on
which
we
can
depend
we
on
our
own
so
far
the
scientists
have
found
no
solution
tomorrow
they
may
find
one
or
it
may
be
years
before
they
do
in
the
meantime
we
have
to
figure
out
how
we
here
in
mayfield
are
going
to
carry
on
our
first
consideration
is
of
course
food
supplies
the
council
met
this
morning
and
we
have
appointed
a
committee
to
take
immediate
possession
of
all
foodstuffs
and
every
facility
for
food
production
within
the
entire
valley
beginning
tomorrow
morning
this
committee
will
begin
to
accumulate
all
food
supplies
into
one
or
more
central
warehouses
where
they
will
be
inventoried
for
rationing
all
stocks
of
fresh
meat
will
be
salted
and
cured
home
supplies
will
be
limited
to
no
more
than
a
week
needs
of
any
one
item
hoarders
who
persist
in
their
unfair
activities
will
be
ordered
to
leave
the
community
my
fellow
citizens
these
are
stringent
and
severe
regulations
but
we
are
not
facing
a
time
of
mild
inconvenience
it
may
well
be
that
in
this
coming
winter
we
shall
be
literally
fighting
for
our
very
lives
we
as
your
leaders
would
like
a
vote
of
confidence
from
you
the
citizens
of
mayfield
as
an
assurance
that
you
will
with
our
efforts
to
the
best
of
your
ability
instantly
nearly
everyone
in
the
auditorium
was
on
his
feet
shouting
his
approval
of
the
mayor
program
mayor
hilliard
had
known
he
was
taking
a
long
chance
in
presenting
so
bluntly
such
a
severe
program
but
long
experience
had
taught
him
the
best
way
into
a
tough
situation
was
a
headlong
plunge
that
ignored
consequences
the
ovation
surprised
him
he
had
expected
substantial
opposition
visibly
moved
he
held
up
his
hand
for
quiet
once
more
our
farms
and
our
livestock
will
be
our
only
means
of
salvation
after
present
food
stocks
are
gone
he
said
a
separate
subcommittee
will
inventory
all
farmland
and
cattle
and
dairy
herds
and
plan
for
their
most
efficient
use
in
the
coming
season
crops
will
be
assigned
as
the
committee
sees
fit
farm
labor
will
be
taken
care
of
by
all
of
us
on
a
community
basis
a
third
program
that
must
begin
immediately
is
the
stockpiling
of
fuel
for
the
coming
winter
wood
will
be
our
only
means
of
heating
and
cooking
because
the
nearest
mines
are
too
far
away
for
us
to
haul
coal
from
them
by
teams
the
same
is
true
of
fuel
oil
stocks
heating
will
be
at
a
minimum
most
of
you
do
not
have
wood
stoves
what
you
have
must
be
converted
to
use
of
wood
an
additional
committee
will
be
appointed
to
supervise
this
conversion
and
the
construction
where
necessary
of
makeshift
stoves
out
of
sheet
metal
old
oil
barrels
and
anything
else
of
which
we
can
make
use
item
by
item
he
continued
down
the
list
of
problems
the
council
had
considered
that
day
he
mentioned
ken
suggestion
for
conservation
of
batteries
he
spoke
of
the
problems
of
medical
care
without
adequate
hospital
facilities
of
police
activities
that
might
be
required
in
a
period
of
stress
such
as
they
could
expect
that
winter
when
he
had
finished
members
of
the
council
detailed
plans
of
the
separate
programs
over
which
they
had
charge
president
lewis
spoke
to
pledge
support
of
the
college
staff
he
pointed
out
the
fortunate
fact
that
they
had
some
of
the
best
minds
in
the
entire
country
in
their
scientific
departments
and
also
had
professor
larsen
visiting
with
them
the
floor
was
turned
over
then
to
members
of
the
audience
for
comment
and
questions
most
of
them
were
favorable
but
sam
cluff
who
owned
a
hundred
and
sixty
of
the
best
acres
in
the
valley
stood
up
and
belligerent
it
all
a
pack
of
nonsense
he
declared
this
is
just
an
excuse
for
certain
people
in
this
town
to
get
their
hands
in
somebody
pockets
and
to
tell
other
people
what
to
do
and
how
to
live
i
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
anybody
who
sets
foot
on
my
land
to
tell
me
what
to
raise
or
to
take
my
goods
away
is
going
to
have
to
reckon
with
a
shotgun
if
there
is
any
real
problem
which
i
doubt
them
government
scientists
will
be
on
the
job
and
get
things
straightened
out
so
that
trains
and
automobiles
will
be
running
by
next
week
my
advice
is
for
everybody
to
go
home
and
let
them
take
care
of
it
mayor
hilliard
smiled
tolerantly
i
should
have
to
remind
you
sam
that
some
of
the
best
scientists
in
the
world
are
right
here
in
our
own
town
and
they
say
the
situation
is
serious
enough
for
emergency
measures
i
hope
you
wo
be
foolish
with
that
shotgun
but
coming
out
to
see
you
tomorrow
sam
granny
wicks
seemed
to
erupt
from
her
place
to
which
she
had
crowded
in
the
center
of
the
hall
all
eyes
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
scratchy
birdlike
voice
i
told
you
she
shrieked
i
told
you
what
was
coming
and
now
maybe
you
believe
me
there
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
bill
hilliard
nothing
at
all
there
death
in
the
air
the
stars
have
spoken
it
the
signs
are
in
the
sky
mayor
hilliard
interrupted
her
perhaps
you
right
granny
he
said
gently
i
do
think
any
of
us
are
going
to
argue
with
you
tonight
we
here
to
do
what
we
can
and
to
make
plans
to
stay
alive
just
as
long
as
possible
at
the
close
aylesworth
took
the
stand
his
commanding
presence
seemed
to
draw
an
aura
of
peace
once
more
around
the
troubled
group
we
are
civilized
men
and
women
he
said
let
us
see
that
we
act
as
such
during
the
months
that
are
ahead
of
us
let
us
remember
that
we
may
see
a
time
very
soon
when
there
will
not
be
enough
food
fuel
and
clothing
for
all
of
us
when
and
if
that
time
comes
let
us
prove
that
we
are
able
to
be
our
brother
keeper
that
we
are
able
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
others
do
unto
us
above
all
may
we
be
able
to
continue
to
call
on
divine
assistance
to
bring
a
speedy
end
to
this
disaster
so
that
when
it
is
over
we
can
look
back
and
be
proud
that
we
conducted
ourselves
as
men
and
women
worthy
to
be
called
civilized
and
worthy
of
the
divine
approval
and
aid
which
we
now
seek
it
was
decided
to
keep
classes
going
in
the
various
schools
as
long
as
possible
releasing
those
students
who
were
needed
to
take
assignments
in
the
emergency
program
ken
and
the
rest
of
the
science
club
members
obtained
immediate
permission
to
devote
their
full
time
to
the
research
program
on
the
morning
after
the
town
meeting
ken
dressed
early
and
rode
his
bicycle
toward
art
garage
to
arrange
with
the
mechanic
the
details
of
the
gathering
and
storage
of
automobile
batteries
on
the
way
he
passed
by
frank
meggs
independent
grocery
market
the
largest
in
mayfield
although
it
was
only
a
little
after
an
enormous
crowd
had
collected
outside
and
inside
the
store
curious
and
ken
parked
his
bicycle
and
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
inside
he
found
frank
meggs
ringing
up
sales
of
large
lots
of
food
a
woman
was
arguing
with
him
at
the
stand
a
dollar
a
pound
for
white
beans
that
ridiculous
frank
meggs
and
you
know
it
sure
i
know
it
the
storekeeper
said
calmly
next
winter
you
be
glad
i
let
you
have
them
for
even
that
price
if
you
do
want
them
watkins
please
move
along
others
will
be
glad
to
have
them
the
woman
hesitated
then
angrily
flung
two
bills
on
the
counter
and
stalked
out
with
her
groceries
ken
shoved
his
way
up
to
the
stand
meggs
he
exclaimed
you
ca
do
this
all
foodstuffs
are
being
called
in
by
the
mayor
committee
he
turned
to
the
people
private
hoards
of
food
will
be
confiscated
and
placed
in
the
community
warehouse
this
is
going
to
do
you
any
good
most
of
the
shoppers
looked
shamefaced
at
his
challenge
but
meggs
bristled
angrily
you
keep
out
of
this
maddox
nobody
asked
you
to
come
in
here
these
people
know
what
they
doing
and
so
do
i
how
much
do
you
think
any
of
us
will
eat
if
townhall
gets
its
hands
on
every
scrap
of
food
in
the
valley
if
you
are
buying
get
moving
i
will
and
i
be
back
just
as
soon
as
i
can
find
the
sheriff
with
telephone
service
now
cut
off
to
conserve
battery
power
ken
hesitated
between
seeking
sheriff
johnson
at
his
office
or
at
home
he
checked
his
watch
again
and
decided
on
the
sheriff
home
he
was
fortunate
in
arriving
just
before
the
sheriff
left
he
explained
quickly
what
was
happening
at
meggs
store
johnson
had
been
assigned
one
of
the
few
remaining
cars
that
would
run
with
ken
he
drove
immediately
to
the
store
they
strode
in
the
shoppers
fanning
out
before
the
sheriff
approach
okay
that
all
he
said
you
folks
leave
your
groceries
right
where
they
are
tell
the
others
they
had
better
bring
theirs
back
and
get
their
money
while
meggs
still
has
it
not
that
anybody
is
going
to
have
much
use
for
money
anyway
you
no
right
to
do
this
meggs
cried
this
is
my
private
property
and
i
entitled
to
do
with
it
as
i
choose
not
any
longer
it
is
said
sheriff
johnson
there
is
such
a
thing
as
private
property
in
mayfield
any
more
except
maybe
the
shirt
on
your
back
and
i
not
sure
of
that
at
any
rate
you
not
selling
these
groceries
accounts
will
be
kept
and
when
and
if
we
get
back
to
normal
you
be
reimbursed
but
for
now
we
all
one
big
happy
family
most
of
the
crowd
had
dispersed
the
armloads
and
pushcarts
full
of
groceries
had
been
abandoned
ken
and
the
sheriff
moved
toward
the
door
another
trick
like
that
and
you
spend
the
time
of
the
emergency
as
a
guest
of
the
city
incidentally
we
do
intend
to
heat
the
jail
this
winter
meggs
turned
the
blaze
of
his
anger
upon
ken
this
is
your
fault
he
snarled
you
and
that
bunch
of
politicians
know
there
not
going
to
be
any
shortage
this
winter
just
as
well
as
i
do
in
a
week
this
whole
thing
will
be
straightened
out
i
had
a
chance
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
i
going
to
get
even
with
you
if
it
the
last
thing
i
ever
do
that
enough
of
that
said
sheriff
johnson
sharply
come
along
ken
ken
was
not
disturbed
by
meggs
threat
of
personal
retaliation
but
he
was
frightened
by
the
realization
that
meggs
was
the
only
one
of
his
kind
in
mayfield
his
patrons
were
only
a
shade
less
unstable
what
would
such
people
do
when
things
really
got
tough
how
much
could
they
be
depended
on
to
pull
their
own
weight
after
he
had
seen
art
matthews
about
collecting
and
storing
the
batteries
ken
went
up
to
science
hall
where
the
rest
of
the
club
members
were
already
at
work
under
the
direction
of
al
miner
who
was
the
best
qualified
to
plan
the
alterations
of
the
ventilation
ducts
they
made
the
necessary
changes
and
installed
one
of
the
motorcycle
engines
to
drive
the
blower
at
the
same
time
three
of
them
built
up
a
power
supply
to
charge
the
filter
elements
by
evening
the
assembly
was
operating
the
motorcycle
engine
chugged
pleasantly
i
wonder
how
long
before
that
one
freezes
up
al
said
pessimistically
we
ought
to
get
more
said
joe
the
way
the
cars
have
gone
we
be
lucky
to
get
more
than
days
out
of
each
one
of
these
during
the
day
ken
father
had
directed
the
preparation
of
metallic
specimens
from
samples
the
boys
had
brought
from
art
garage
and
from
those
the
men
brought
back
from
the
power
plant
with
the
electron
microscope
photographs
were
taken
as
they
finished
their
work
the
boys
went
with
ken
to
the
laboratory
professor
maddox
looked
up
hello
fellows
he
said
have
you
got
your
piece
of
machinery
running
purring
like
a
top
said
ken
expected
to
run
about
as
long
said
al
have
you
finished
any
photomicrographs
ken
asked
do
they
show
anything
his
father
passed
over
a
wet
print
the
boys
gathered
around
it
it
does
mean
much
to
me
said
dave
whitaker
can
you
tell
us
what
it
shows
ken
father
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
touched
it
lightly
to
a
barely
perceptible
line
across
the
center
of
the
picture
that
is
the
boundary
he
said
between
the
cylinder
wall
and
the
piston
taken
from
one
of
the
samples
you
brought
in
i
ca
see
anything
that
looks
like
a
line
between
two
pieces
of
metal
said
ted
watkins
it
looks
like
one
solid
chunk
to
me
that
is
substantially
what
it
is
said
professor
maddox
there
is
no
longer
any
real
boundary
as
there
would
be
between
two
ordinary
pieces
of
metal
molecules
from
each
piece
have
flowed
into
the
other
mixing
just
as
two
very
viscous
liquids
would
do
they
have
actually
become
one
piece
of
metal
he
took
up
another
photograph
here
you
can
see
that
the
same
thing
has
happened
in
the
case
of
the
shaft
and
bearing
samples
we
obtained
from
the
collin
dam
power
plant
molecules
of
the
two
separate
pieces
of
metal
have
intermingled
becoming
one
single
piece
how
could
they
do
that
ken
exclaimed
metals
ca
flow
like
liquids
they
can
if
the
conditions
are
right
when
steel
is
heated
to
a
sufficiently
high
temperature
it
flows
like
water
but
that
not
the
case
here
no
it
is
of
course
at
lower
temperatures
the
molecules
of
a
solid
do
not
possess
the
energy
of
motion
which
they
have
in
a
liquid
state
the
metallic
surface
of
a
piece
of
cold
steel
has
a
certain
surface
tension
which
prevents
the
escape
of
the
relatively
molecules
thus
it
has
the
characteristics
we
ascribe
to
a
solid
then
what
has
happened
in
this
case
joe
asked
are
you
able
to
tell
professor
maddox
nodded
the
photographs
show
us
what
has
happened
but
they
reveal
nothing
about
how
or
why
we
can
see
the
surface
tension
of
the
two
pieces
of
metal
has
obviously
broken
down
so
that
the
small
energy
of
motion
possessed
by
the
molecules
has
permitted
them
to
move
toward
each
other
with
a
consequent
mixing
of
the
two
metals
it
has
turned
them
quite
literally
into
a
single
piece
the
most
effective
kind
of
weld
you
can
imagine
what
would
cause
the
surface
tension
to
break
down
like
that
ken
asked
that
is
what
remains
for
us
to
find
out
we
do
have
the
faintest
idea
what
has
caused
it
it
becomes
especially
baffling
when
we
recall
that
it
has
happened
not
in
a
single
isolated
instance
but
all
over
the
world
you
would
think
the
metals
would
have
become
soft
like
putty
or
something
for
a
thing
like
that
to
happen
to
them
said
joe
it
would
be
expected
that
the
hardness
would
be
affected
this
is
not
true
however
the
metals
seem
just
as
hard
as
before
the
effect
of
mixing
seems
to
take
place
only
when
the
metals
are
in
sliding
motion
against
one
another
as
in
the
case
of
a
piston
and
cylinder
or
a
shaft
and
a
bearing
the
effect
is
comparatively
slow
taking
place
over
a
number
of
days
the
two
surfaces
must
break
down
gradually
increasing
the
friction
to
a
point
where
motion
must
cease
then
the
mixing
continues
until
they
are
welded
solidly
to
each
other
ordinarily
the
dusk
of
evening
would
have
fallen
over
the
landscape
but
the
blaze
of
the
comet
now
lit
the
countryside
with
an
unnatural
gold
that
reflected
like
a
flame
through
the
windows
and
onto
the
faces
of
the
men
and
boys
in
the
laboratory
as
to
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
professor
maddox
said
with
an
obviously
weary
deliberation
in
his
voice
we
can
only
hope
to
find
an
explanation
and
a
cure
before
it
is
too
late
to
do
the
world
any
good
there
ca
be
any
question
of
that
said
ken
intensely
the
resources
of
the
whole
scientific
world
will
be
turned
on
this
one
problem
every
industrial
university
and
governmental
laboratory
will
be
working
on
it
modern
science
can
certainly
lick
a
thing
like
this
professor
maddox
turned
from
the
window
which
he
had
been
facing
a
faint
grim
smile
touched
the
corners
of
his
lips
and
died
as
he
regarded
the
boys
especially
ken
his
face
took
on
a
depth
of
soberness
ken
seldom
saw
in
his
father
you
think
nothing
is
immune
to
an
attack
by
modern
science
he
said
sure
ken
went
on
enthusiastically
not
understanding
the
expression
on
his
father
face
look
at
the
problems
that
have
been
licked
as
soon
as
people
were
determined
enough
and
willing
to
pay
the
cost
giant
computers
radar
eyes
atomic
energy
everybody
knows
we
could
have
made
it
to
mars
by
now
if
governments
had
been
willing
to
put
up
the
necessary
money
you
still
have
to
learn
all
of
you
do
professor
maddox
said
slowly
that
the
thing
we
call
science
is
only
a
myth
the
only
reality
consists
of
human
beings
trying
to
solve
difficult
problems
their
results
which
seem
to
be
solutions
to
some
of
those
problems
we
call
science
science
has
no
life
of
its
own
it
does
not
deserve
to
be
spoken
of
as
an
entity
in
its
own
right
there
are
only
people
whom
we
call
scientists
and
their
accomplishments
are
severely
limited
by
their
quite
meager
abilities
meager
when
viewed
in
comparison
with
the
magnitude
of
the
problems
they
attack
ken
felt
bewildered
he
had
never
heard
his
father
speak
this
way
before
do
you
believe
there
are
scientists
enough
scientists
who
know
enough
to
lick
a
thing
like
this
in
time
i
do
know
i
quite
sure
no
one
knows
we
became
conscious
long
ago
of
the
fallacy
of
assuming
that
the
concentration
of
men
enough
and
unlimited
funds
would
solve
any
problem
in
the
world
for
every
great
accomplishment
like
atomic
energy
to
which
we
point
with
pride
there
are
a
thousand
other
problems
equally
important
that
remain
unsolved
who
knows
whether
or
not
this
problem
of
weakened
surface
tension
in
metals
is
one
of
the
insoluble
ones
we
have
to
find
an
answer
said
ken
doggedly
he
could
not
understand
his
father
words
there
nothing
science
ca
accomplish
if
it
sets
about
it
with
enough
determination
nothing
chapter
ken
spent
an
almost
sleepless
night
he
tossed
for
long
hours
and
dozed
finally
but
he
awoke
again
before
there
was
even
a
trace
of
dawn
in
the
sky
although
the
night
was
cool
he
was
sweating
as
if
it
were
there
was
a
queasiness
in
his
stomach
too
a
slow
undefinable
pressure
on
some
hidden
nerve
he
had
never
known
he
possessed
the
feeling
pulsed
and
throbbed
slowly
and
painfully
he
sat
up
and
looked
out
at
the
dark
landscape
and
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
scared
he
thought
i
scared
sick
he
never
known
anything
like
it
before
in
his
life
except
maybe
the
time
when
he
was
years
old
and
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
very
high
tree
when
the
wind
was
blowing
and
he
had
been
afraid
to
come
down
it
was
hitting
him
he
thought
he
was
just
beginning
to
understand
what
this
stoppage
of
machinery
really
meant
and
he
wondered
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
that
he
had
not
felt
it
earlier
was
he
alone
had
everyone
else
understood
it
before
he
had
or
would
it
hit
them
one
by
one
just
as
it
was
hitting
him
now
bringing
him
face
to
face
with
what
lay
ahead
he
knew
what
had
done
it
it
was
his
father
expression
and
his
words
in
the
laboratory
the
night
before
ken
recognized
that
he
had
never
doubted
for
an
instant
that
scientists
and
their
tools
were
wholly
adequate
to
solve
this
problem
in
a
reasonable
time
he
had
been
aware
there
would
be
great
hardships
but
he
had
never
doubted
there
would
be
an
end
to
that
time
he
had
believed
his
father
as
a
scientist
had
the
same
faith
it
was
a
staggering
shock
to
learn
that
his
father
had
no
faith
in
science
a
shock
to
be
told
that
science
was
not
a
thing
that
warranted
a
man
faith
ken
had
planned
his
whole
life
around
an
avid
faith
in
science
he
tried
to
imagine
what
the
world
would
be
like
if
no
engine
should
ever
run
again
the
standards
of
civilized
existence
would
be
shattered
only
those
areas
of
the
world
where
people
had
never
learned
to
depend
on
motor
transportation
or
electric
power
would
be
unaffected
those
areas
of
china
india
and
africa
where
men
still
scratched
the
ground
with
a
forked
stick
and
asked
only
for
a
cup
of
rice
or
grain
each
day
this
would
become
the
level
of
the
whole
world
until
last
night
ken
had
never
believed
it
remotely
possible
now
his
father
words
had
shaken
him
out
of
the
certainty
that
science
would
avert
such
consequences
it
happen
he
thought
of
his
own
plans
and
ambitions
there
would
be
no
need
for
scientists
nor
the
opportunity
to
become
one
in
a
world
of
men
who
grubbed
the
land
with
forked
sticks
he
felt
a
sudden
blind
and
bitter
anger
even
if
the
disaster
were
overcome
in
a
matter
of
years
his
opportunity
would
be
gone
he
knew
at
once
that
such
anger
was
selfish
and
futile
his
own
personal
calamities
would
be
the
least
of
the
troubles
ahead
but
for
the
moment
he
could
not
help
it
in
a
way
it
felt
good
because
it
overshadowed
the
dark
fear
that
still
throbbed
in
his
body
but
something
else
was
gone
too
the
opportunity
for
him
and
his
science
club
friends
to
investigate
the
properties
of
the
altered
metal
was
over
his
father
and
the
other
scientists
had
taken
over
those
studies
and
there
would
be
no
place
for
boys
who
did
not
know
even
enough
to
prepare
a
slide
for
an
electron
microscope
it
had
always
been
that
way
as
long
as
he
could
remember
he
had
always
been
too
young
and
too
ignorant
to
be
intrusted
with
work
that
mattered
he
supposed
they
would
turn
the
operation
of
the
air
filter
over
to
one
of
the
teaching
fellows
even
though
that
was
something
the
club
could
handle
the
bitterness
and
the
fear
seemed
more
than
he
could
endure
he
dressed
quietly
and
went
downstairs
without
lighting
a
lamp
he
found
something
to
eat
the
first
light
of
dawn
was
showing
when
he
left
the
house
for
an
hour
he
walked
the
silent
streets
without
meeting
anyone
normally
there
would
have
been
the
sound
of
milk
trucks
and
the
cars
of
workers
now
there
was
nothing
the
comet
had
risen
just
above
the
eastern
hills
and
in
its
light
the
city
was
like
some
fabulous
golden
ruin
that
belonged
in
an
ancient
fairytale
ken
did
know
where
he
was
going
or
what
he
was
going
to
do
there
ought
to
be
something
useful
he
could
do
he
thought
fiercely
as
he
looked
down
the
street
he
saw
a
wagons
with
two
teams
each
stopped
in
front
of
sims
hardware
and
lumber
in
the
wagons
were
several
dozen
men
ken
recognized
andrew
norton
of
the
mayor
council
and
henry
atkins
the
sheriff
chief
deputy
several
of
the
men
were
emerging
from
the
hardware
store
with
new
axes
and
saws
then
ken
understood
this
was
the
first
wood
detail
headed
for
the
mountains
to
begin
gathering
and
stockpiling
fuel
for
the
winter
he
broke
into
a
run
deputy
atkins
appeared
to
be
in
charge
of
the
group
ken
hailed
him
i
want
to
go
along
atkins
may
i
go
the
deputy
glanced
down
at
him
and
frowned
he
consulted
a
sheet
of
paper
he
drew
from
his
pocket
your
name
is
on
the
list
for
this
morning
ken
were
you
assigned
i
guess
not
but
i
have
got
anything
else
to
do
today
is
there
any
objection
to
my
going
i
do
suppose
so
said
atkins
dubiously
it
just
that
your
name
may
be
on
some
other
list
we
do
want
to
get
these
things
fouled
up
right
off
the
bat
there
enough
trouble
as
it
is
i
sure
my
name
not
on
any
other
list
i
have
been
told
about
it
all
right
climb
on
as
ken
climbed
into
the
nearest
wagon
he
was
startled
to
find
himself
staring
into
the
face
of
frank
meggs
the
storekeeper
grinned
unpleasantly
as
he
nodded
his
head
in
ken
direction
and
spoke
to
his
neighbor
now
what
do
you
know
about
that
old
man
maddox
letting
his
own
little
boy
out
alone
this
early
in
the
morning
i
bet
he
let
you
did
he
i
bet
you
had
to
run
away
to
try
to
prove
you
a
big
boy
now
cut
it
out
meggs
said
atkins
sharply
we
heard
all
about
what
went
on
in
your
store
yesterday
the
man
next
to
meggs
drew
away
but
it
did
seem
to
bother
him
he
continued
to
grin
crookedly
at
ken
are
you
afraid
you
might
get
hurt
trying
to
do
a
man
work
ken
ignored
the
jibes
and
faced
away
from
the
storekeeper
the
slow
rhythmic
jogging
of
the
wagon
and
the
frosty
air
as
they
came
into
the
mountains
took
some
of
the
bitterness
out
of
ken
it
made
him
feel
freshly
alive
he
had
come
often
to
hunt
here
and
felt
a
familiarity
with
every
tree
and
rock
around
him
the
wagon
train
came
to
a
halt
in
a
grove
of
saplings
that
needed
thinning
no
use
taking
our
best
timber
until
we
have
to
said
atkins
start
here
i
take
a
crew
and
go
on
ahead
and
mark
the
ones
to
be
cut
you
drivers
unhitch
your
teams
and
drag
the
logs
out
to
the
wagons
after
they
cut
there
was
none
of
the
kidding
and
horseplay
that
would
have
been
normal
in
such
a
group
each
man
seemed
intent
on
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
come
and
was
absorbed
with
his
own
thoughts
ken
took
a
ax
and
followed
atkins
along
the
trail
he
moved
away
from
the
others
and
began
cutting
one
of
the
young
trees
atkins
had
marked
by
noon
he
was
bathed
in
sweat
and
his
arms
and
back
ached
he
had
thought
he
was
in
good
condition
from
his
football
and
track
work
but
he
seemed
to
have
found
new
muscles
that
had
never
come
into
play
before
atkins
noticed
the
amount
he
had
cut
and
complimented
him
better
take
it
easy
you
way
ahead
of
everybody
else
and
we
do
have
to
get
it
all
out
today
ken
grinned
enjoying
the
aches
of
his
muscles
if
it
has
to
be
done
we
might
as
well
do
it
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
frank
meggs
had
cut
almost
nothing
but
had
spent
his
time
complaining
to
his
companions
about
the
unnecessary
work
they
were
doing
after
lunch
which
ken
had
reluctantly
accepted
from
the
others
there
was
a
stir
at
the
arrival
of
a
newcomer
on
horseback
ken
recognized
him
as
mike
travis
one
of
the
carpenters
and
caretakers
at
the
college
mike
tied
his
horse
to
the
tailboard
of
a
wagon
and
approached
the
woodcutters
there
you
are
ken
maddox
he
said
accusingly
why
did
you
let
somebody
know
where
you
were
going
your
father
been
chewing
up
everyone
in
sight
trying
to
find
out
where
you
gone
he
finally
decided
you
might
be
up
here
and
sent
me
after
you
take
the
horse
on
back
i
finish
up
the
day
on
the
wood
detail
ken
felt
suddenly
awkward
and
uncomfortable
i
did
mean
to
worry
him
but
i
guess
i
did
forget
to
say
where
i
was
going
do
you
think
it
would
be
okay
if
i
stayed
and
you
told
dad
you
had
found
me
not
on
your
life
he
chew
me
down
to
the
ankles
if
i
went
back
without
you
okay
i
go
ken
said
although
he
knew
he
should
have
left
word
it
still
seemed
strange
that
his
father
should
be
so
concerned
as
to
send
a
man
up
here
looking
for
him
it
seemed
like
more
of
the
unfamiliar
facets
of
his
father
personality
that
ken
had
glimpsed
last
night
frank
meggs
was
watching
from
across
the
clearing
i
guess
papa
maddox
could
stand
the
thought
of
his
little
boy
doing
a
man
work
for
a
whole
day
he
said
loudly
and
maliciously
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
ken
tied
the
mare
to
a
tree
on
the
campus
where
she
could
graze
he
glanced
over
the
valley
below
not
a
single
car
was
in
sight
on
the
roads
somehow
it
was
beginning
to
seem
that
this
was
the
way
it
had
always
been
his
own
car
seemed
like
something
he
had
possessed
a
thousand
years
ago
he
found
his
father
in
the
laboratory
working
with
the
electron
microscope
professor
maddox
looked
up
and
gestured
toward
the
office
as
ken
sat
down
he
shut
the
door
behind
them
and
took
a
seat
behind
his
old
oak
desk
that
was
still
cluttered
with
unmarked
examination
papers
you
did
say
anything
about
where
you
were
going
this
morning
he
said
i
sorry
about
that
ken
answered
i
got
up
early
and
took
a
walk
through
town
all
of
a
sudden
well
i
guess
i
got
panicky
when
it
finally
hit
me
as
to
what
all
this
really
means
i
saw
the
wood
detail
going
out
and
joined
them
it
felt
good
out
there
with
nothing
to
think
about
except
getting
a
tree
to
fall
right
you
ran
away
you
were
needed
here
ken
stammered
i
did
think
you
wanted
any
of
us
kids
around
since
you
and
the
other
men
had
taken
over
what
we
had
started
to
do
you
were
angry
that
it
was
your
own
show
any
longer
were
you
i
guess
that
part
of
it
ken
admitted
his
face
reddening
he
know
what
was
happening
his
father
had
never
spoken
to
him
like
this
before
he
seemed
suddenly
critical
and
disapproving
of
everything
about
ken
after
a
long
time
his
father
spoke
again
more
gently
this
time
been
your
ambition
for
a
long
time
to
be
a
scientist
has
it
you
know
it
has
i
been
very
pleased
too
i
watched
you
and
encouraged
your
interests
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
you
been
developing
in
the
right
direction
i
glad
you
think
so
ken
said
but
you
wanted
to
be
a
scientist
you
had
an
ambition
to
emulate
men
like
newton
faraday
davy
and
the
modern
giants
such
as
einstein
planck
de
broglie
oppenheimer
maybe
i
have
got
the
brains
but
i
can
try
his
father
snorted
impatiently
do
you
think
any
one
of
them
tried
deliberately
to
be
great
or
to
copy
anyone
else
ken
understood
his
meaning
now
i
guess
they
did
you
ca
really
do
a
thing
like
that
no
you
ca
you
take
the
brains
god
has
given
you
and
apply
them
to
the
universe
as
you
see
it
the
results
take
care
of
themselves
some
of
us
have
enough
insight
to
achieve
greatness
most
of
us
lack
the
cleverness
to
cope
effectively
with
such
a
wily
opponent
as
the
natural
universe
greatness
and
mediocrity
have
no
meaning
to
a
man
who
is
absorbed
in
his
study
you
do
what
you
have
to
do
you
do
what
the
best
and
highest
impulses
of
your
brain
tell
you
to
do
expect
nothing
more
than
this
of
yourself
nothing
more
is
possible
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
ken
said
i
doubt
it
most
of
the
men
i
know
have
never
learned
it
they
struggle
to
write
more
papers
to
get
their
names
in
more
journals
than
their
colleagues
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
be
patted
on
the
back
they
are
the
failures
as
scientists
for
an
example
of
success
i
recommend
that
you
observe
larsen
closely
he
is
a
man
who
has
done
a
great
deal
to
advance
our
knowledge
of
physical
chemistry
professor
maddox
paused
then
he
said
finally
there
is
just
one
other
thing
what
that
ken
asked
up
to
now
you
and
all
your
friends
have
only
played
at
science
played
ken
cried
we
built
our
observatory
a
radio
transmitter
play
these
things
are
toys
educational
toys
it
is
true
but
toys
nevertheless
i
do
understand
toys
are
fine
for
children
you
and
your
friends
however
are
no
longer
children
you
have
got
a
chance
now
to
grow
up
and
gain
an
education
in
a
normal
manner
you
ca
finish
your
childhood
playing
with
your
toys
you
ca
take
all
the
time
you
need
to
find
out
what
your
capacities
and
aptitudes
are
you
will
never
know
a
world
that
will
allow
you
that
luxury
every
available
brain
is
needed
on
this
problem
you
got
to
make
a
decision
today
this
very
minute
whether
you
want
to
give
a
hand
to
its
solution
you
know
i
want
to
be
in
on
it
do
you
then
you
got
to
decide
that
you
are
no
longer
concerned
about
being
a
scientist
forget
the
word
what
you
are
does
not
matter
you
are
simply
a
man
with
a
problem
to
solve
you
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
can
abandon
your
compassion
for
the
millions
who
are
going
to
die
whether
you
can
reject
all
pressure
from
personal
danger
and
from
the
threat
to
everything
and
everyone
that
is
of
any
importance
to
you
you
got
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
problem
of
the
destruction
of
surface
tension
of
metals
is
the
most
absorbing
thing
in
the
whole
world
it
needs
solving
not
because
the
fate
of
the
world
hinges
on
it
but
because
it
a
problem
that
consumes
you
utterly
this
is
what
drives
you
not
fear
not
danger
not
the
opinion
of
anyone
else
when
he
can
function
this
way
the
scientist
is
capable
of
solving
important
problems
by
outward
heartlessness
he
can
achieve
works
of
compassion
greater
than
any
of
his
critics
he
knows
that
the
greatest
pleasure
a
man
can
know
lies
in
taking
a
stand
against
those
forces
that
bend
ordinary
men
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
ken
suddenly
felt
that
he
knew
his
father
i
wish
you
had
talked
to
me
like
this
a
long
time
ago
he
said
professor
maddox
shook
his
head
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
you
to
find
out
these
things
for
yourself
my
telling
you
does
not
convince
you
they
are
true
that
conviction
must
still
come
from
within
do
you
want
me
to
become
a
scientist
ken
asked
it
does
make
any
difference
what
i
want
his
father
answered
almost
roughly
he
was
looking
away
from
ken
and
then
his
eyes
found
his
and
his
glance
softened
he
reached
across
the
desk
and
grasped
hand
yes
i
want
it
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
he
said
earnestly
but
it
got
to
be
what
you
want
too
or
it
no
good
at
all
do
try
to
be
anything
for
my
sake
determine
your
own
goals
clearly
and
take
as
straight
a
path
as
you
can
to
reach
them
just
remember
if
you
do
choose
science
the
standards
are
severe
it
what
i
want
said
ken
evenly
you
said
you
needed
me
here
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
empty
trash
cans
if
we
ask
it
professor
maddox
said
forget
about
whose
show
it
is
professor
larsen
and
i
will
be
directing
the
research
and
we
need
every
pair
of
hands
and
every
brain
that
got
an
ounce
of
intelligence
in
this
field
you
do
whatever
you
are
asked
to
do
and
think
of
every
possible
answer
to
the
questions
that
come
before
you
is
that
good
enough
more
than
enough
ken
felt
a
sudden
stinging
sensation
behind
his
eyes
and
turned
to
rub
their
corners
roughly
what
about
the
other
fellows
in
the
club
can
you
use
them
too
as
many
as
have
the
ounce
of
intelligence
i
spoke
of
the
rest
of
them
do
need
to
know
the
things
i
have
told
you
but
with
you
it
was
different
i
had
to
know
you
understood
just
a
little
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
scientist
i
be
one
i
show
you
i
can
be
one
chapter
from
the
ken
felt
he
had
grown
inches
taller
after
his
father
discussion
as
if
he
had
passed
some
ancient
ritual
he
could
be
admitted
to
the
company
of
adults
and
his
opinions
would
be
heard
this
proved
to
be
true
his
father
rapidly
organized
the
facilities
of
the
college
laboratories
and
recruited
every
possible
science
student
in
the
chemistry
and
physics
departments
as
well
as
many
from
the
high
school
as
these
plans
were
outlined
ken
made
a
proposal
of
his
own
i
believe
our
first
move
he
said
should
be
to
set
up
a
network
of
amateur
radio
stations
operating
in
cities
where
there
are
other
laboratories
if
you
could
be
in
touch
with
them
ideas
could
be
exchanged
and
duplication
of
work
avoided
an
excellent
idea
said
professor
maddox
you
can
work
it
out
as
we
go
along
no
it
ought
to
be
done
immediately
ken
said
if
not
it
may
be
almost
impossible
to
find
anyone
on
the
air
later
there
may
not
be
many
amateurs
who
will
bother
to
convert
their
rigs
to
battery
operation
there
may
not
be
many
who
can
get
the
batteries
together
good
enough
his
father
said
let
that
have
priority
over
everything
else
until
you
get
it
organized
probably
you
should
find
at
least
two
contacts
in
each
of
the
university
centers
put
at
the
top
of
your
list
berkeley
pasadena
chicago
new
york
and
washington
see
if
you
can
get
relay
contacts
that
will
put
us
in
touch
with
stockholm
paris
london
berlin
and
tokyo
if
so
we
can
have
contact
with
the
majority
of
the
workers
capable
of
contributing
most
to
this
problem
i
do
my
best
ken
promised
someone
would
be
needed
to
operate
the
station
and
spend
a
good
many
hours
a
week
listening
and
recording
he
did
want
to
spend
the
time
necessary
doing
that
and
he
knew
none
of
the
other
club
members
would
either
at
once
he
thought
of
maria
larsen
she
would
undoubtedly
be
happy
to
take
over
the
job
and
feel
she
was
doing
something
useful
on
the
way
home
he
stopped
at
her
house
and
told
her
what
he
had
in
mind
she
readily
agreed
i
do
know
anything
about
radio
she
said
you
have
to
show
me
what
to
do
we
wo
expect
you
to
learn
code
of
course
he
said
when
we
do
handle
anything
coming
in
by
code
one
of
us
will
have
to
take
it
try
to
contact
phone
stations
wherever
possible
for
this
program
we
have
in
mind
most
of
the
stuff
will
be
put
on
tape
and
dad
will
probably
want
you
to
prepare
typed
copies
too
you
can
do
enough
to
take
a
big
load
off
the
rest
of
us
i
be
happy
to
try
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
radio
room
of
the
science
shack
ken
taught
maria
the
simple
operations
of
turning
on
the
transmitter
and
receiver
of
handling
the
tuning
controls
and
the
proper
procedure
for
making
and
receiving
calls
he
supposed
there
would
be
some
technical
objection
to
her
operation
of
the
station
without
an
operator
license
but
he
was
quite
sure
that
such
things
were
not
important
right
now
it
was
a
new
kind
of
experience
for
maria
her
face
was
alive
with
excitement
as
ken
checked
several
bands
to
see
where
amateurs
were
still
operating
the
babble
of
code
whistles
alternated
in
the
room
with
faint
sometimes
muffled
voices
on
the
phone
band
there
are
more
stations
than
i
expected
ken
said
with
luck
we
may
be
able
to
establish
a
few
of
the
contacts
we
need
tonight
after
many
tries
he
succeeded
in
raising
an
operator
in
san
francisco
they
traded
news
and
it
sounded
as
if
the
west
coast
city
was
crumbling
swiftly
ken
explained
what
he
wanted
promised
to
try
to
raise
someone
with
a
phone
rig
in
berkeley
near
the
university
they
listened
to
him
calling
but
could
not
hear
the
station
he
finally
raised
what
good
will
that
do
maria
asked
if
we
ca
hear
the
station
in
berkeley
he
may
be
working
on
a
relay
deal
through
the
small
rig
it
better
than
nothing
but
i
prefer
a
station
we
can
contact
directly
in
a
few
minutes
the
san
francisco
operator
called
them
back
knows
a
ham
with
a
phone
near
the
university
he
said
he
thinks
he
go
for
your
deal
but
he
not
set
up
for
battery
in
fact
he
about
ready
to
evacuate
maybe
he
can
be
persuaded
to
stay
told
he
a
guy
who
will
do
the
noble
thing
if
he
sees
a
reason
for
it
there
plenty
of
reason
for
this
said
ken
let
set
a
schedule
for
i
ought
to
have
word
on
it
by
then
they
agreed
and
cut
off
in
another
hour
they
had
managed
a
contact
with
a
chicago
operator
and
explained
what
they
wanted
you
out
of
luck
here
the
ham
replied
this
town
is
falling
apart
at
the
seams
right
now
the
whole
loop
area
has
been
burned
out
there
been
rioting
for
hours
straight
the
militia
have
been
trying
to
hold
things
together
but
i
do
think
they
even
know
whether
anybody
is
still
on
top
giving
the
orders
i
try
to
find
out
what
the
eggheads
at
the
university
are
doing
but
if
they
got
any
kind
of
research
running
in
this
mess
it
surprise
me
if
they
are
still
there
i
hang
on
and
report
to
you
otherwise
i
heading
north
there
not
much
sense
to
it
but
when
something
like
this
happens
a
guy
got
to
run
or
have
a
good
reason
for
staying
put
if
he
does
he
go
nuts
the
chicago
operator
agreed
to
a
schedule
for
the
following
morning
maria
and
ken
sat
in
silence
not
looking
at
each
other
after
they
cut
off
it
will
be
that
way
in
all
the
big
cities
wo
it
maria
asked
i
afraid
so
we
luckier
than
they
are
ken
said
but
i
wonder
how
long
we
stay
lucky
he
was
thinking
of
frank
meggs
and
the
people
who
had
swamped
his
store
at
came
back
on
the
berkeley
phone
was
enthusiastic
about
being
a
contact
post
with
the
university
people
he
had
promised
to
make
arrangements
with
them
and
to
round
up
enough
batteries
to
convert
his
transmitter
and
receiver
they
had
no
further
success
that
night
ken
father
shook
his
head
sadly
when
told
of
the
situation
in
chicago
i
had
counted
on
them
he
said
their
people
are
among
the
best
in
the
world
and
they
have
the
finest
equipment
i
hope
things
are
not
like
that
everywhere
members
of
the
science
club
took
turns
at
the
transmitter
the
following
days
for
stretches
until
everything
possible
had
been
done
to
establish
the
contacts
requested
by
professor
maddox
in
chicago
there
appeared
to
have
been
a
complete
collapse
the
operator
there
reported
he
was
unable
to
reach
any
of
the
scientific
personnel
at
the
university
he
promised
a
further
contact
but
when
the
time
came
he
could
not
be
reached
there
was
no
voice
at
all
in
the
chicago
area
ken
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
man
whose
voice
they
had
heard
briefly
he
was
certain
he
would
never
know
although
there
was
much
disorder
on
the
west
coast
the
situation
was
in
somewhat
better
control
the
rioting
had
not
yet
threatened
the
universities
and
both
berkeley
and
pasadena
were
working
frantically
on
the
problem
with
shifts
in
their
laboratories
they
had
welcomed
wholeheartedly
the
communication
network
initiated
by
the
mayfield
group
in
washington
tight
military
control
was
keeping
things
somewhat
in
order
in
stockholm
where
contact
had
been
established
through
a
washington
relay
after
days
of
steady
effort
there
was
no
rioting
whatever
paris
and
london
had
suffered
but
their
leading
universities
were
at
work
on
the
problem
tokyo
reported
similar
conditions
ken
grinned
at
maria
as
they
received
the
stockholm
report
those
swedes
he
said
they
pretty
good
at
keeping
their
heads
maria
answered
with
a
faint
smile
of
her
own
everybody
should
be
swedes
no
the
fall
winds
and
the
black
frost
came
early
that
year
as
if
in
fair
warning
that
the
winter
intended
a
brutal
assault
upon
the
stricken
world
the
pile
of
logs
in
the
community
woodlot
grew
steadily
a
large
crew
of
men
worked
to
reduce
the
logs
to
stove
lengths
they
had
made
a
crude
attempt
to
set
up
a
circular
saw
using
animal
power
to
drive
it
the
shaft
was
mounted
in
hardwood
blocks
driven
by
a
complicated
arrangement
of
wooden
pulleys
and
leather
belts
the
horses
worked
it
through
a
treadmill
the
apparatus
worked
part
of
the
time
but
it
scarcely
paid
for
itself
when
measured
against
the
efforts
of
the
men
who
had
to
keep
it
in
repair
the
food
storage
program
was
well
underway
two
central
warehouses
had
been
prepared
from
the
converted
empire
movie
theater
and
the
rainbow
skating
rink
ken
wished
their
efforts
at
the
college
laboratory
were
going
half
as
well
as
the
days
passed
it
seemed
they
were
getting
nowhere
the
first
effort
to
identify
any
foreign
substance
in
the
atmospheric
dust
was
a
failure
calculations
showed
they
had
probably
not
allowed
sufficient
time
to
sample
a
large
enough
volume
of
air
it
was
getting
increasingly
difficult
to
keep
the
blower
system
going
all
of
their
original
supply
of
small
engines
had
broken
down
the
town
had
been
scoured
for
replacements
these
too
were
failing
in
the
metallurgical
department
hundreds
of
tests
had
been
run
on
samples
taken
from
frozen
engines
the
photomicrographs
all
showed
a
uniform
peculiarity
which
the
scientists
could
not
explain
embedded
in
the
crystalline
structure
of
the
metal
were
what
appeared
to
be
some
kind
of
foreign
amorphous
particles
which
were
concentrated
near
the
line
of
union
of
the
two
parts
berkeley
and
pasadena
confirmed
these
results
with
their
own
tests
there
was
almost
unanimous
belief
that
it
was
in
no
way
connected
with
the
comet
ken
stood
almost
alone
in
his
dogged
conviction
that
the
earth
presence
in
the
tail
of
the
comet
could
be
responsible
for
the
catastrophe
another
theory
that
was
gaining
increasing
acceptance
was
that
this
foreign
substance
was
an
unexpected
of
the
hydrogen
and
atomic
bomb
testing
that
had
been
going
on
for
so
many
years
ken
was
forced
to
admit
the
possibility
of
this
inasmuch
as
radiation
products
were
scattered
heavily
now
throughout
the
earth
atmosphere
both
russia
and
britain
had
conducted
extensive
tests
just
before
the
breakdowns
began
occurring
the
members
of
the
science
club
had
been
allowed
to
retain
complete
control
of
the
program
they
washed
the
filters
carefully
at
intervals
and
distilled
the
solvent
to
recover
the
precious
residue
of
dust
as
the
small
quantity
of
this
grew
after
another
week
of
collecting
it
was
treated
to
remove
the
ordinary
carbon
particles
and
accumulated
pollens
when
this
was
done
there
was
very
little
remaining
but
that
little
something
might
be
ordinary
dust
carried
into
the
atmosphere
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
or
it
might
be
out
of
the
tail
of
the
comet
dust
from
the
stars
by
now
ken
and
his
companions
had
learned
the
use
of
the
electron
microscope
and
how
to
prepare
specimens
for
it
when
their
samples
of
dust
had
become
sufficient
they
prepared
a
dozen
slides
for
photographing
with
the
instrument
as
these
were
at
last
developed
in
the
darkroom
ken
scanned
them
eagerly
actually
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
looking
for
none
of
them
did
the
prints
seemed
to
show
little
more
than
shapeless
patches
in
the
light
of
the
laboratory
he
called
joe
walton
attention
to
one
picture
look
he
said
ever
see
anything
like
that
before
joe
started
to
shake
his
head
then
he
gave
an
exclamation
hey
they
look
like
the
same
particles
found
in
the
metals
which
nobody
has
been
able
to
identify
yet
ken
nodded
it
could
be
maybe
this
will
get
us
only
a
horselaugh
for
our
trouble
but
let
see
what
they
think
they
went
into
the
next
laboratory
and
laid
the
prints
before
father
and
his
associates
ken
knew
at
once
from
the
expressions
on
the
men
faces
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
laughed
at
i
think
there
may
be
something
here
said
professor
maddox
trying
to
suppress
his
excitement
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
in
a
picture
like
this
whether
one
particle
is
similar
to
any
other
but
their
size
and
configuration
are
very
much
alike
professor
douglas
grunted
disdainfully
impossible
with
that
dismissal
he
moved
away
professor
larsen
looked
more
carefully
you
could
scrape
dust
from
a
thousand
different
sources
and
get
pictures
like
this
from
half
of
them
perhaps
only
the
chemical
tests
will
show
us
the
nature
of
this
material
i
am
certain
it
is
very
worthwhile
following
up
i
feel
certain
that
whatever
contaminating
agent
we
are
dealing
with
is
airborne
said
professor
maddox
if
this
is
the
same
substance
it
will
not
tell
us
its
origin
of
course
nor
will
it
even
prove
it
is
responsible
for
these
effects
however
it
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
we
can
certainly
stand
that
could
we
tell
by
spectroscopic
analysis
said
ken
that
would
be
difficult
to
say
the
commonness
of
the
elements
involved
might
mask
what
you
are
looking
for
get
john
vickers
to
help
you
set
up
equipment
for
making
some
comparisons
vickers
was
the
teaching
fellow
in
the
chemistry
department
whom
professor
maddox
had
planned
to
assign
to
help
the
boys
when
they
first
suggested
atmospheric
analysis
he
had
become
indispensable
in
the
research
since
then
but
he
liked
helping
the
boys
it
was
not
too
long
since
he
had
been
at
the
same
stage
in
his
own
career
he
understood
their
longing
to
do
something
worthwhile
and
their
embarrassment
at
their
ineptness
sure
guys
he
said
when
professor
maddox
called
him
in
let
see
if
we
can
find
out
what
this
stuff
is
who
knows
maybe
we
got
a
bear
by
the
tail
it
was
delicate
precision
work
preparing
specimens
and
obtaining
spectrographs
of
the
lines
that
represented
the
elements
contained
in
them
time
after
time
their
efforts
failed
something
went
wrong
either
with
their
sample
preparation
or
with
their
manipulation
of
the
instruments
ken
began
to
feel
as
if
their
hands
possessed
nothing
but
thumbs
that
the
way
it
goes
john
vickers
consoled
them
half
of
this
business
of
being
a
scientist
is
knowing
how
to
screw
a
nut
on
a
bolt
in
the
dark
unless
you
one
of
these
guys
who
do
it
all
in
their
heads
like
einstein
we
wasting
our
samples
ken
said
it
taken
two
weeks
to
collect
this
much
then
this
is
the
one
that
does
it
said
vickers
try
it
now
ken
turned
the
switch
that
illuminated
the
spectrum
and
exposed
the
photographic
plate
after
a
moment
he
cut
it
off
that
had
better
do
it
he
said
after
the
plates
were
developed
they
had
two
successful
spectrographs
for
comparison
one
was
taken
from
the
metal
of
a
part
the
other
was
from
the
atmospheric
dust
in
the
comparator
vickers
brought
the
corresponding
standard
comparison
lines
together
for
a
long
time
he
peered
through
the
eyepiece
a
lot
of
lines
match
up
he
said
i
can
throw
out
most
of
them
though
carbon
oxygen
a
faint
sodium
the
stuff
that
giving
us
trouble
might
be
a
compound
of
one
of
these
said
ken
that
right
if
so
we
ought
to
find
matching
lines
of
other
possible
elements
in
the
compounds
concerned
i
do
see
any
reasonable
combination
at
all
he
paused
hey
here
something
i
noticed
he
shifted
the
picture
to
the
heavy
end
of
the
spectrum
there
a
very
sharp
line
matched
on
both
pictures
the
boys
took
a
look
at
it
through
the
viewer
what
is
that
one
ken
asked
i
do
know
i
used
a
carbon
standard
i
should
have
used
one
farther
toward
the
heavy
end
this
one
looks
like
it
would
have
to
be
a
transuranic
element
something
entirely
new
like
plutonium
then
it
could
be
from
the
hydrogen
bomb
tests
said
joe
it
could
be
said
vickers
but
somehow
i
got
a
feeling
it
is
is
there
a
quick
way
to
find
out
said
ken
how
if
we
took
a
spectrograph
of
the
comet
and
found
this
same
line
strongly
present
we
would
have
a
good
case
for
proving
the
comet
was
the
source
of
this
substance
let
have
a
try
said
vickers
i
do
know
how
successfully
we
can
get
a
spectrograph
of
the
comet
but
it
worth
an
attempt
their
time
was
short
before
the
comet
vanished
below
the
horizon
for
the
night
they
called
for
help
from
the
other
boys
and
moved
the
equipment
to
the
roof
using
the
small
portable
telescope
belonging
to
the
physics
department
there
was
time
for
only
one
exposure
after
the
sun
had
set
and
the
comet
had
dropped
below
the
horizon
they
came
out
of
the
darkroom
and
placed
the
prints
in
the
viewing
instrument
vickers
moved
the
adjustments
gently
after
a
time
he
looked
up
at
the
circle
of
boys
you
were
right
ken
he
said
your
hunch
was
right
the
comet
is
responsible
our
engines
have
been
stopped
by
dust
from
the
stars
chapter
there
are
people
who
feed
upon
disaster
and
grow
in
their
own
particular
direction
as
they
would
never
have
grown
without
it
as
does
the
queen
bee
who
becomes
queen
only
because
of
the
special
food
prepared
by
the
workers
for
her
private
use
such
a
man
was
henry
maddox
he
would
not
have
admitted
it
nor
was
he
ever
able
to
realize
it
for
it
violated
the
very
principles
he
had
laid
down
for
ken
but
for
him
the
comet
was
like
a
sudden
burst
of
purpose
in
his
life
he
had
taught
well
in
his
career
as
professor
of
chemistry
at
the
state
agricultural
college
at
mayfield
but
it
had
become
fairly
mechanical
he
was
vaguely
aware
of
straining
at
the
chains
of
routine
from
time
to
time
but
he
had
always
forced
himself
through
sheer
exercise
of
will
to
attend
to
his
duties
there
was
never
time
however
for
any
of
the
research
he
used
to
tell
himself
in
his
younger
days
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
sudden
thrusting
aside
of
all
customary
duties
and
with
the
impact
of
catastrophe
demanding
a
solution
to
a
research
problem
he
came
alive
without
knowing
what
was
happening
yet
without
the
imminence
of
disaster
he
would
not
have
found
the
strength
to
drive
himself
so
this
was
what
he
could
not
admit
to
himself
another
who
was
nourished
was
granny
wicks
she
should
have
been
dead
years
ago
she
had
admitted
this
to
herself
and
to
anyone
else
who
would
listen
but
now
she
knew
why
she
had
been
kept
alive
so
long
past
her
time
she
had
been
waiting
for
the
comet
its
energy
seemed
to
flow
from
the
sky
into
her
withered
bony
frame
and
she
drank
of
its
substance
until
time
seemed
to
reverse
itself
in
her
obsolete
body
all
her
life
she
had
been
waiting
for
this
time
she
knew
it
now
she
was
spared
to
tell
the
people
why
the
comet
had
come
although
her
purpose
was
diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
henry
maddox
she
also
fed
and
grew
to
her
full
stature
after
almost
a
century
of
existence
frank
meggs
was
surely
another
he
was
born
in
mayfield
and
had
lived
there
all
his
life
and
he
hated
every
minute
of
time
and
every
person
and
every
event
that
told
of
his
wasted
life
here
he
hated
college
hill
for
he
had
never
been
able
to
go
there
his
family
had
been
too
poor
and
he
had
been
forced
to
take
over
his
father
store
when
his
father
died
he
had
once
dreamed
of
becoming
a
great
businessman
and
owning
a
chain
of
stores
that
would
stretch
from
coast
to
coast
but
circumstances
for
which
he
blamed
the
whole
of
mayfield
had
never
permitted
him
to
leave
the
town
his
panic
sale
had
been
his
final
explosive
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
make
it
now
he
too
found
himself
growing
in
his
own
special
direction
as
he
fed
upon
the
disaster
he
did
not
know
just
what
that
direction
was
or
to
where
it
led
but
he
felt
the
growth
he
felt
the
secret
pleasure
of
contemplating
the
discomfort
and
the
privation
that
lay
ahead
for
his
fellow
citizens
in
the
coming
months
while
personal
fear
forced
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
disaster
would
be
of
short
duration
the
pleasure
was
nevertheless
real
it
was
especially
intense
when
he
thought
of
college
hill
and
its
inhabitants
in
scenes
of
dark
dismay
as
they
wrestled
in
vain
to
understand
what
had
happened
to
the
world
there
were
others
who
fed
upon
the
disaster
for
the
most
part
they
found
it
an
interruption
to
be
met
with
courage
with
faith
with
whatever
strength
was
inherent
in
them
it
was
not
a
time
of
growth
however
for
reverend
aylesworth
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
for
which
he
had
been
preparing
all
his
life
now
he
would
test
and
verify
the
stature
he
had
already
gained
on
the
night
they
verified
the
presence
of
the
comet
dust
in
the
disabled
engines
ken
was
the
last
to
leave
the
laboratory
it
was
near
midnight
when
he
got
away
his
father
had
left
much
earlier
urging
him
to
come
along
but
ken
had
been
unable
to
pull
himself
away
from
the
examination
and
measurement
of
the
spectrum
of
lines
that
bared
the
comet
secret
he
had
begun
to
understand
the
pleasure
his
father
had
spoken
of
the
pleasure
of
being
consumed
utterly
by
a
problem
important
in
its
own
right
as
he
left
the
campus
there
was
no
moon
in
the
sky
the
comet
was
gone
and
the
stars
seemed
new
in
a
glory
he
had
not
seen
for
many
nights
he
felt
that
he
would
be
able
to
sleep
even
when
he
got
home
and
he
continued
walking
for
several
blocks
in
the
direction
of
town
he
came
abreast
finally
of
the
former
rainbow
skating
rink
which
had
been
converted
into
a
food
warehouse
in
the
darkness
he
saw
a
sudden
swift
movement
against
the
wall
of
the
building
his
night
vision
was
sharp
after
the
long
walk
he
saw
what
was
going
on
the
broad
doors
of
the
rink
had
been
broken
open
there
were
three
or
four
men
lifting
sacks
and
boxes
and
barrels
stealthily
into
a
wagon
even
as
he
started
toward
them
he
realized
his
own
foolishness
and
pulled
back
a
horse
whinnied
softly
he
turned
to
run
in
the
direction
of
sheriff
johnson
house
and
behind
him
came
a
sudden
hoarse
cry
of
alarm
horses
hoofs
rattled
frighteningly
loud
on
the
cement
ken
realized
he
stood
no
chance
of
escaping
if
he
were
seen
he
dodged
for
an
instant
into
a
narrow
space
between
two
buildings
with
the
thought
of
reaching
an
alley
at
the
back
however
it
was
boarded
at
the
end
and
he
saw
that
he
would
have
to
scale
the
fence
a
desperate
horseman
would
ride
him
down
in
the
narrow
space
he
fled
on
and
reached
the
shadows
in
front
of
the
drugstore
he
pressed
himself
as
flat
as
possible
in
the
recess
of
the
doorway
hoping
his
pursuer
would
race
by
but
his
fleeing
shadow
had
been
seen
the
rider
whirled
and
reined
the
horse
to
a
furious
stop
the
front
legs
pawed
the
air
in
front
of
ken
face
then
ken
saw
there
was
something
familiar
about
the
figure
he
peered
closer
as
the
horseman
whirled
again
jed
he
called
softly
jed
tucker
the
figure
answered
harshly
yeah
yeah
that
me
and
you
ken
i
sorry
it
had
to
be
you
why
did
you
have
to
come
by
here
at
this
time
of
night
ken
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
in
the
distance
as
others
came
to
join
jed
tucker
jed
had
not
dismounted
but
held
ken
prisoner
in
the
recess
with
the
rearing
impatient
horse
ken
wondered
how
jed
tucker
could
be
mixed
up
in
a
thing
like
this
his
father
was
president
of
the
bank
and
owned
one
of
the
best
homes
in
mayfield
jed
and
ken
had
played
football
on
the
first
team
together
last
year
jed
ken
said
quickly
give
it
up
do
go
through
with
this
shut
up
jed
snarled
he
reined
the
horse
nearer
threatening
ken
with
the
thrashing
front
legs
when
jed
companions
arrived
jed
dismounted
from
the
horse
who
is
it
a
panting
voice
asked
a
cold
panic
shot
through
ken
he
recognized
the
voice
it
was
that
of
tucker
himself
the
bank
official
was
taking
part
in
the
looting
of
the
warehouse
the
third
man
ken
recognized
in
rising
horror
was
allen
a
neighbor
of
the
tuckers
he
was
the
town
foremost
attorney
and
one
of
its
most
prominent
citizens
we
ca
let
him
go
allen
was
saying
whoever
he
is
we
got
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
tucker
came
closer
he
gasped
in
dismay
it
young
maddox
he
said
you
what
are
you
doing
out
this
time
of
night
under
any
other
conditions
the
question
would
have
seemed
humorous
coming
from
whom
it
did
now
but
ken
felt
no
humor
he
sensed
the
desperate
fury
in
these
men
give
it
up
he
repeated
quietly
the
lives
of
fifteen
thousand
people
depend
on
this
food
supply
you
have
no
right
to
steal
an
ounce
that
does
belong
to
you
i
never
tell
what
i
seen
tucker
shook
his
head
in
a
dazed
uncomprehending
manner
as
if
the
proposition
were
too
fantastic
to
be
considered
we
ca
do
that
he
said
we
ca
let
him
go
allen
repeated
you
ca
expect
us
to
risk
murder
there
be
plenty
of
that
before
this
winter
over
our
lives
depend
on
this
food
you
know
that
tucker
said
desperately
to
ken
you
take
your
share
and
we
all
be
in
this
together
then
we
know
we
be
safe
ken
considered
his
panic
increasing
to
refuse
might
mean
his
life
if
he
could
pretend
to
fall
in
with
them
you
ca
trust
him
allen
raged
no
one
is
going
to
be
in
on
this
except
us
suddenly
the
lawyer
stepped
near
his
hand
raised
high
in
the
air
before
ken
sensed
his
intention
a
heavy
club
smashed
against
his
head
his
body
fell
in
a
crumpled
heap
on
the
sidewalk
it
was
after
when
professor
maddox
awoke
with
the
sensation
that
something
was
vaguely
wrong
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
out
the
window
at
the
starlit
sky
he
remembered
he
had
left
ken
at
the
university
and
had
not
yet
heard
him
come
in
quietly
he
arose
from
the
bed
and
tiptoed
along
the
hallway
to
room
he
used
the
beam
of
a
precious
flashlight
for
a
moment
to
scan
the
undisturbed
bed
panic
started
inside
him
and
was
fought
down
probably
ken
had
found
something
interesting
to
keep
him
from
noticing
the
alarm
clock
on
a
shelf
in
the
laboratory
perhaps
someone
had
even
forgotten
to
wind
the
clock
and
it
had
run
down
perhaps
even
the
bearings
of
its
balance
wheel
had
finally
become
frozen
and
had
brought
it
to
a
stop
maddox
was
behind
him
as
he
turned
from
the
door
what
wrong
she
asked
he
flashed
the
light
on
the
bed
again
i
better
go
up
to
the
laboratory
and
have
a
look
he
said
ken
mother
nodded
she
sensed
her
husband
worry
and
wanted
not
to
add
to
it
take
ken
bicycle
she
said
it
will
be
quicker
even
if
you
have
to
walk
it
uphill
i
have
some
hot
chocolate
for
you
when
you
come
back
professor
maddox
dressed
hurriedly
and
took
the
bicycle
from
the
garage
he
did
have
to
wheel
it
most
of
the
way
up
the
hill
but
it
would
be
easier
coming
down
anyway
he
thought
he
wondered
how
much
longer
the
bearings
in
it
would
hold
up
without
freezing
as
he
came
within
view
of
the
laboratory
building
he
saw
that
the
windows
were
utterly
dark
he
knew
that
even
with
the
shades
down
he
would
have
been
able
to
see
some
glow
of
the
oil
lamps
which
they
used
provided
ken
were
still
there
he
waited
a
full
minutes
against
the
chance
that
ken
had
put
out
the
lamps
and
was
on
his
way
out
then
he
knew
ken
had
gone
long
ago
he
ought
to
call
the
sheriff
and
have
the
police
cars
search
for
him
but
there
were
no
phones
and
no
cars
he
mounted
the
bicycle
in
fresh
panic
and
rode
recklessly
down
the
hill
to
town
at
sheriff
johnson
house
he
pounded
frantically
on
the
door
until
the
sheriff
shouted
angrily
through
an
open
window
who
is
it
it
maddox
you
got
to
help
me
johnson
ken
disappeared
he
went
into
details
and
the
sheriff
grunted
holding
back
his
irritation
at
being
disturbed
because
of
his
long
friendship
with
henry
maddox
i
guess
i
should
have
gone
down
to
the
station
said
professor
maddox
realizing
what
he
had
done
i
had
forgotten
there
would
be
men
on
duty
it
all
right
i
come
with
you
the
sheriff
car
had
broken
down
days
before
he
kept
a
horse
for
his
own
official
use
you
can
ride
behind
me
he
said
sally
a
pretty
decent
gal
you
get
up
there
on
the
porch
railing
and
climb
on
right
behind
me
professor
maddox
maneuvered
himself
behind
the
sheriff
on
the
horse
balancing
unsteadily
as
sally
shied
away
where
do
you
think
ken
could
have
gone
asked
johnson
do
you
suppose
he
over
at
one
of
his
friend
he
would
do
a
thing
like
that
without
letting
us
know
he
went
up
the
canyon
with
the
wood
detail
or
weeks
ago
i
know
but
that
was
different
are
there
any
policemen
on
the
streets
now
what
happened
to
the
ones
who
used
to
patrol
in
the
radio
cars
they
walking
their
beats
most
of
them
two
are
mounted
in
each
district
we
stop
by
the
station
and
then
try
to
find
the
mounted
officers
it
the
only
thing
we
can
do
they
moved
down
the
dark
empty
streets
it
seemed
as
if
there
never
had
been
any
life
flowing
along
them
and
never
would
be
again
they
passed
the
station
lit
by
a
smoking
oil
lamp
and
left
word
of
disappearance
and
moved
on
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
business
section
where
street
lamps
used
to
shine
this
area
was
even
more
ghostly
than
the
rest
but
policemen
patrolled
it
perhaps
out
of
habit
and
a
conviction
that
failure
to
do
so
would
admit
the
end
of
all
that
was
familiar
and
right
as
they
rode
on
the
clatter
of
other
hoofbeats
on
the
cement
sounded
behind
them
johnson
turned
and
halted
a
flashlight
shone
in
their
faces
it
was
officer
dan
morris
who
identified
himself
by
turning
the
light
on
his
own
face
the
warehouse
has
been
broken
into
he
said
over
at
the
skating
rink
somebody
has
busted
in
and
made
off
with
a
lot
of
food
the
sheriff
seemed
stunned
by
the
news
what
idiots
he
muttered
what
complete
pinheaded
idiots
we
turned
out
to
be
we
did
even
think
to
put
a
special
guard
around
the
warehouse
do
any
of
the
other
patrolmen
know
yes
clark
and
dudly
are
over
there
now
i
was
trying
to
round
up
someone
else
while
they
look
for
clues
i
have
to
get
over
there
said
johnson
but
ken
professor
maddox
said
i
got
to
keep
looking
you
come
with
us
i
got
to
look
into
the
robbery
ken
ca
have
come
to
any
harm
i
pass
the
word
along
and
we
all
keep
watch
for
him
i
promise
you
we
will
i
keep
on
said
professor
maddox
he
slid
from
the
horse
keep
moving
along
the
street
here
if
you
find
anything
i
be
somewhere
between
here
and
home
unwillingly
sheriff
johnson
turned
and
left
him
the
sounds
of
the
two
horses
echoed
loudly
in
the
deserted
street
professor
maddox
felt
a
burst
of
anger
at
their
abandonment
of
him
but
he
supposed
the
sheriff
was
doing
what
he
had
to
do
he
recognized
that
it
was
foolhardy
to
be
afoot
in
the
deserted
town
this
time
of
night
without
a
single
clue
to
ken
whereabouts
what
could
he
hope
to
accomplish
he
strode
on
along
the
sidewalk
in
the
direction
the
policeman
had
disappeared
it
was
as
good
a
direction
as
any
after
he
had
gone
a
block
he
stumbled
in
the
darkness
some
soft
resilient
object
lay
across
the
sidewalk
before
billings
drugstore
in
anger
at
the
obstacle
professor
maddox
caught
himself
and
moved
on
a
sound
stopped
him
a
groan
of
agony
came
from
the
object
upon
which
he
had
stumbled
he
turned
and
bent
down
and
knew
it
was
a
human
being
faintly
under
the
starlight
he
glimpsed
the
dark
pool
of
blood
on
the
sidewalk
he
turned
the
body
gently
until
he
could
see
the
face
it
was
ken
he
did
know
how
long
he
knelt
there
inspecting
the
motionless
features
of
his
son
he
was
aware
only
of
running
frantically
in
the
direction
of
the
warehouse
he
found
johnson
he
clutched
the
arm
they
killed
him
he
cried
i
found
ken
and
they
killed
him
johnson
turned
to
the
nearest
officer
ride
for
adams
dudly
get
that
horse
and
wagon
that
at
whitaker
place
where
did
you
say
you
found
ken
professor
at
billings
lying
on
the
sidewalk
with
his
head
smashed
in
you
others
meet
us
there
he
called
clumsily
they
mounted
the
sheriff
horse
together
again
it
seemed
to
take
hours
to
ride
the
short
distance
they
dismounted
and
johnson
knelt
and
touched
the
boy
tenderly
then
professor
maddox
heard
barely
audible
the
sound
he
would
remember
all
his
life
as
the
most
wonderful
sound
in
the
world
dad
ken
lips
moved
with
the
word
dad
his
voice
was
a
plea
for
help
chapter
there
was
snow
it
covered
the
whole
world
beyond
the
hospital
window
its
depth
was
frightening
and
the
walls
seemed
no
barrier
it
was
as
much
inside
as
out
filling
the
room
to
the
ceiling
with
a
fluffy
white
that
swirled
and
pulsed
in
waves
before
his
eyes
much
later
when
the
pain
softened
and
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
only
real
snow
was
that
piled
outside
almost
to
the
level
of
the
windows
within
the
room
the
outline
of
familiar
objects
showed
clearly
in
consciousness
he
wondered
impersonally
about
the
dying
pain
in
his
head
and
how
he
came
to
be
where
he
was
he
could
remember
only
about
a
strange
thing
in
the
sky
and
a
great
fear
then
it
burst
upon
him
in
full
recollection
the
comet
the
dust
the
laboratory
they
had
proved
the
dust
that
was
in
the
comet
tail
had
accumulated
in
the
metal
surfaces
of
the
failed
engines
what
more
did
they
need
to
prove
the
comet
responsibility
he
slept
and
when
he
awoke
his
father
was
there
hi
son
professor
maddox
said
ken
smiled
weakly
hi
dad
adams
would
let
them
talk
much
and
he
did
want
ken
father
to
tell
him
why
he
was
there
he
wanted
ken
to
dredge
out
of
his
own
memories
the
circumstances
of
the
attack
ken
said
i
got
to
get
out
of
here
things
must
be
getting
behind
at
the
lab
have
you
found
anything
new
take
it
easy
his
father
said
we
got
a
little
better
picture
of
what
we
up
against
the
dust
is
quite
definitely
from
the
tail
it
has
a
very
large
molecule
and
is
suspended
in
our
atmosphere
in
colloidal
form
its
basis
is
a
transuranic
element
which
is
however
only
slightly
radioactive
by
volume
it
is
present
in
the
amount
of
about
one
part
in
ten
million
which
is
fairly
heavy
concentration
for
an
alien
substance
of
that
kind
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
we
found
is
that
it
has
a
strong
affinity
for
metals
so
that
its
accumulation
on
metallic
surfaces
is
much
higher
than
in
the
general
atmosphere
it
would
ken
said
with
a
vague
attempt
at
humor
why
could
it
have
had
an
affinity
for
old
rubber
tires
or
secondhand
galoshes
how
late
is
it
can
i
get
up
to
the
lab
this
afternoon
ken
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
a
gigantic
pain
shot
through
his
head
and
down
his
spinal
column
he
felt
as
if
his
head
were
encased
in
a
cement
block
he
fell
back
with
a
groan
do
try
that
again
for
a
few
days
his
father
said
severely
not
going
anywhere
for
quite
a
while
i
have
to
go
now
but
your
mother
will
be
in
tonight
maria
will
come
too
you
do
what
the
doctors
and
nurses
tell
you
to
dad
why
am
i
here
he
moaned
in
agony
of
both
spirit
and
body
you
had
an
accident
said
adams
smoothly
it
will
all
come
back
to
you
and
you
soon
be
fine
ken
watched
his
father
disappear
through
the
doorway
he
felt
the
sting
of
a
needle
in
his
arm
and
was
aware
the
nurse
was
standing
near
he
wanted
to
talk
some
more
but
suddenly
he
was
too
tired
to
do
anything
it
came
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
like
a
dark
wild
dream
that
could
be
only
the
utmost
fantasy
he
remembered
the
silent
shapeless
figures
against
the
black
wall
of
the
old
skating
rink
and
then
he
knew
it
was
a
dream
because
he
could
remember
clearly
the
words
of
jed
tucker
and
his
father
he
could
also
remember
allen
saying
we
ca
let
him
go
whoever
he
is
we
got
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
he
remembered
the
instant
of
crashing
pain
allen
had
struck
with
the
intent
to
kill
him
again
he
wondered
for
a
moment
if
it
were
not
just
a
nightmare
allen
the
town
leading
attorney
and
tucker
the
banker
what
would
they
be
doing
plotting
robbery
and
killing
in
the
morning
he
told
his
father
about
it
professor
maddox
could
not
believe
it
either
you
must
be
mistaken
ken
he
protested
these
men
are
two
of
our
leading
citizens
they
both
on
the
mayor
food
committee
you
suffered
a
pretty
terrible
shock
and
you
have
to
realize
the
effects
of
it
may
be
with
you
and
may
upset
your
thinking
for
quite
a
while
not
about
this
i
know
who
it
was
i
recognized
their
voices
in
the
dark
jed
tucker
admitted
his
identity
when
i
called
his
name
if
there
anything
gone
from
the
warehouse
sheriff
johnson
will
find
it
in
their
possession
the
sheriff
had
to
wait
for
permission
from
adams
but
he
came
around
that
afternoon
and
was
equally
unbelieving
he
advanced
the
same
arguments
professor
maddox
had
used
about
the
character
of
those
ken
accused
these
men
will
do
something
far
worse
if
you
do
stop
them
said
ken
he
right
there
said
professor
maddox
those
who
did
this
menace
the
whole
community
they
got
to
be
found
we
make
fools
of
ourselves
said
the
sheriff
if
we
go
to
and
allen
and
demand
to
search
the
premises
we
got
to
have
more
than
your
word
ken
some
evidence
of
their
positive
connection
with
the
crime
i
just
know
i
saw
and
heard
them
that
all
listen
the
sheriff
said
suddenly
there
one
man
in
this
town
that
really
out
to
get
you
frank
meggs
do
you
think
it
could
be
meggs
and
some
of
his
friends
no
it
was
frank
meggs
art
matthews
came
around
later
that
same
day
you
look
worse
than
one
of
these
engines
that
got
itself
full
of
stardust
he
said
you
must
have
been
off
your
rocker
prowling
around
back
alleys
in
the
middle
of
the
night
ken
grinned
hi
art
i
knew
you
be
full
of
sympathy
what
going
on
outside
while
i
been
laid
up
say
i
do
even
know
how
long
been
here
what
day
is
it
tuesday
not
that
it
makes
any
difference
any
more
tuesday
and
it
was
saturday
when
i
was
working
with
the
spectroscope
i
been
here
three
days
a
week
and
three
days
said
art
matthews
you
were
out
cold
for
three
days
straight
and
they
wondered
if
your
bearings
were
ever
going
to
turn
again
ken
lay
back
in
astonishment
nobody
told
me
anything
happening
outside
it
going
to
be
a
rough
winter
art
matthews
said
grimly
started
heavy
two
weeks
earlier
than
usual
i
understand
professor
douglas
thinks
it
got
something
to
do
with
the
comet
dust
in
the
air
that
figures
what
about
the
fuel
supply
in
pretty
sad
shape
too
so
far
the
stockpile
is
big
enough
for
about
a
week
and
a
half
of
real
cold
they
laid
off
woodcutting
for
three
days
to
spend
all
the
time
converting
oil
burners
and
making
new
heaters
out
of
barrels
and
anything
else
they
could
find
it
going
to
be
a
mighty
cold
winter
and
a
hungry
one
ken
nodded
but
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
else
i
had
an
idea
he
said
how
your
stock
of
spare
parts
in
the
garage
good
i
always
was
a
fool
about
stocking
up
on
things
i
could
never
sell
any
blocks
about
a
dozen
why
could
you
make
a
engine
out
of
spare
parts
the
mechanic
considered
then
nodded
i
think
i
could
put
together
a
ford
or
chevy
engine
what
good
would
that
do
it
would
run
down
in
a
few
days
just
like
all
the
rest
do
you
think
it
would
if
you
put
it
in
a
sealed
room
and
supplied
only
filtered
air
to
it
art
eyes
lighted
why
the
dickens
did
we
think
of
that
before
if
we
could
keep
the
stardust
from
getting
to
the
engine
there
no
reason
at
all
why
it
should
run
as
long
as
we
wanted
it
to
is
there
if
a
generator
could
be
assembled
in
the
same
way
we
could
stir
up
a
little
power
on
an
experimental
basis
enough
to
charge
our
radio
batteries
i
wonder
how
much
power
could
be
generated
in
the
whole
country
by
such
means
i
know
we
could
get
a
couple
of
dozen
engines
going
here
in
mayfield
at
least
said
art
why
do
you
get
started
right
away
get
some
of
the
club
guys
to
help
if
that
filter
idea
works
there
may
be
a
lot
of
things
we
can
do
art
started
for
the
door
sheer
genius
he
said
admiringly
sheer
genius
boy
ken
smiled
to
himself
he
wondered
why
they
had
tried
that
when
they
first
had
the
hunch
that
comet
dust
could
be
responsible
maybe
they
could
have
saved
some
of
the
cars
if
they
had
rigged
more
efficient
filters
on
the
air
intakes
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
attack
he
was
still
thinking
about
it
when
his
father
and
sheriff
johnson
returned
we
took
your
word
son
the
sheriff
said
chagrined
we
got
a
warrant
and
searched
the
tucker
and
allen
premises
from
top
to
bottom
we
went
out
to
tucker
farm
and
went
through
the
barns
and
the
house
got
a
supply
of
rations
just
like
everybody
else
they
screamed
their
heads
off
and
threatened
suit
for
slander
and
false
arrest
and
everything
else
in
the
books
i
get
hold
of
jed
tucker
when
i
get
out
of
here
said
ken
talk
when
i
get
through
with
him
do
get
yourself
in
a
worse
jam
than
you
stirred
up
already
unless
you
can
prove
what
you
say
you
just
have
to
forget
it
and
keep
quiet
ken
smiled
suddenly
it
just
occurred
to
me
when
a
banker
wants
to
keep
something
safe
where
does
he
put
it
in
the
bank
of
course
said
the
sheriff
wait
a
minute
you
think
why
not
the
bank
is
doing
business
any
more
tucker
is
the
only
one
probably
who
has
any
excuse
to
go
down
there
as
long
as
things
are
the
way
they
are
nobody
else
is
going
to
get
inside
the
vault
or
even
inside
the
building
professor
maddox
and
the
sheriff
looked
at
each
other
it
a
logical
idea
said
ken
father
it
as
crazy
as
the
rest
of
it
we
made
fools
of
ourselves
already
so
we
might
as
well
finish
the
job
when
breakfast
was
served
the
next
morning
ken
found
out
his
hunch
had
been
right
he
heard
it
from
miss
haskins
the
nurse
and
knew
therefore
that
it
must
be
all
over
town
the
nurse
was
what
do
you
think
she
said
as
she
set
out
the
bowl
of
oatmeal
the
sheriff
found
that
tucker
had
filled
his
bank
vault
with
food
he
stolen
it
from
the
warehouse
the
men
obtained
a
warrant
and
forced
tucker
to
open
the
vault
and
there
were
cases
of
canned
goods
stacked
clear
to
the
ceiling
he
must
have
been
afraid
of
getting
hungry
said
ken
to
think
a
man
like
tucker
would
do
something
like
that
she
went
out
clucking
her
tongue
in
exaggerated
dismay
ken
leaned
back
with
satisfaction
he
quite
agreed
with
miss
haskins
it
was
a
pretty
awful
thing
for
a
man
like
tucker
to
have
done
how
many
others
would
do
far
worse
before
the
winter
was
over
the
sun
came
out
bright
and
clear
after
the
series
of
heavy
snowstorms
the
comet
added
its
overwhelming
golden
light
and
tinted
the
world
of
snow
some
of
the
snow
was
melted
by
the
tantalizing
warmth
but
water
that
had
melted
in
the
daytime
froze
immediately
at
night
and
the
unequal
contest
between
the
elements
could
have
only
one
outcome
in
a
prematurely
cold
and
miserable
winter
as
the
pain
in
his
head
dwindled
and
he
was
able
to
get
about
in
the
hospital
ken
grew
more
and
more
impatient
to
be
released
he
wondered
about
the
heating
and
other
facilities
in
the
hospital
and
learned
the
mayor
committee
had
ordered
one
wing
kept
open
at
all
times
with
heat
and
food
available
to
care
for
any
emergency
cases
three
days
after
he
was
allowed
on
his
feet
ken
was
told
by
adams
that
he
could
be
released
for
the
hearing
of
the
tuckers
and
allen
ken
stared
at
him
i
do
want
to
go
to
any
hearing
i
going
back
to
the
laboratory
you
can
go
home
said
adams
i
want
you
to
rest
a
few
more
days
and
then
i
would
prefer
seeing
you
get
out
in
the
open
working
with
the
wood
crew
instead
of
going
right
back
to
the
lab
as
for
the
trial
and
hearing
i
afraid
you
have
no
choice
judge
rankin
has
postponed
the
hearing
so
that
you
could
appear
and
issue
a
subpoena
if
necessary
to
insure
your
presence
they
caught
tucker
redhanded
with
his
bank
vault
stuffed
to
the
ceiling
with
stolen
goods
they
do
need
me
they
tried
to
kill
you
adams
reminded
him
that
quite
different
from
robbing
a
warehouse
i
not
interested
in
their
punishment
it
more
important
to
work
on
the
analysis
of
the
comet
dust
but
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
judge
rankin
ordered
ken
to
appear
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
building
was
unheated
and
mushy
snow
was
falling
from
a
heavy
sky
once
more
the
courtroom
was
jammed
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
ken
raged
inwardly
at
the
enormous
waste
of
human
resources
men
who
should
have
been
in
the
hills
gathering
wood
women
who
should
have
been
at
work
on
clothing
and
food
projects
were
there
to
feed
on
the
carcasses
of
the
reputations
presently
to
be
destroyed
ken
had
little
difficulty
feeling
sorry
for
jed
his
former
teammate
had
been
a
good
sport
in
all
ken
experience
of
playing
with
him
he
could
almost
feel
pity
for
jed
father
too
on
the
stand
the
banker
looked
steadfastly
at
the
floor
as
he
answered
questions
in
a
dull
monotone
voice
he
admitted
the
theft
of
the
warehouse
goods
judge
rankin
asked
severely
why
tucker
why
did
you
think
you
had
any
more
right
to
hoard
supplies
than
the
rest
of
us
for
the
first
time
the
banker
looked
up
and
he
met
the
judge
eyes
we
were
scared
he
said
simply
we
were
scared
of
what
is
going
to
happen
this
winter
the
judge
eyes
flashed
so
you
were
scared
he
cried
do
you
think
we
all
scared
the
banker
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
the
floor
i
do
know
he
said
as
if
in
a
daze
we
were
just
scared
the
lawyer
allen
was
more
belligerent
when
he
took
the
stand
we
merely
did
what
anyone
else
in
this
courtroom
would
do
if
he
had
the
chance
and
thought
of
it
first
he
said
do
with
me
what
you
like
but
before
this
winter
is
over
i
see
you
citizens
of
mayfield
at
each
other
throats
for
a
scrap
of
food
he
admitted
the
attack
on
ken
but
denied
the
intent
to
kill
when
ken
turn
came
he
told
his
story
as
simply
and
as
quickly
as
possible
and
when
he
had
finished
he
said
i
like
to
add
one
more
word
if
i
may
the
judge
nodded
go
ahead
ken
he
looked
over
the
faces
of
the
audience
we
got
troubles
enough
he
said
slowly
as
much
as
we
hate
to
admit
it
the
picture
allen
gives
us
may
be
right
unless
we
do
what
we
can
to
stop
it
we
wasting
time
and
resources
today
my
father
and
i
should
be
at
the
laboratory
every
man
and
woman
here
is
neglecting
a
job
we
waste
time
deliberating
about
punishment
for
some
of
our
neighbors
who
are
perhaps
weaker
but
certainly
no
more
frightened
than
the
rest
of
us
if
we
lock
them
up
in
prison
somebody
has
to
watch
out
for
them
and
the
whole
community
is
deprived
of
their
useful
labor
why
do
we
just
let
them
go
a
gasp
of
surprise
came
from
the
spectators
but
a
slow
illumination
seemed
to
light
the
face
of
judge
rankin
his
eyes
moved
from
ken
to
the
accused
men
and
then
to
the
audience
this
court
has
just
heard
what
it
considers
some
very
sound
advice
he
said
jed
tucker
allen
the
three
stood
before
him
i
am
taking
it
upon
myself
because
of
the
emergency
conditions
that
confront
us
to
declare
that
the
penalty
for
your
crime
is
continued
and
incessant
labor
at
any
task
the
community
may
see
fit
to
assign
you
you
are
marked
men
your
crime
is
known
to
every
member
of
this
community
there
will
be
no
escape
from
the
surveillance
of
your
neighbors
and
friends
i
sentence
you
to
so
conduct
yourselves
in
the
eyes
of
these
people
that
if
we
do
come
through
this
time
of
crisis
you
may
stand
redeemed
for
all
time
of
the
crime
which
you
have
committed
if
you
fail
to
do
this
the
punishment
which
will
be
automatically
imposed
is
banishment
from
this
community
for
the
duration
of
the
emergency
court
stands
adjourned
a
burst
of
cheers
broke
out
in
the
room
the
tuckers
and
allen
looked
as
if
they
could
not
believe
what
they
had
heard
then
jed
turned
suddenly
and
rushed
toward
ken
it
no
good
saying
i
been
a
fool
but
let
me
say
thanks
for
your
help
tucker
took
ken
other
hand
you
never
regret
it
young
man
i
see
to
it
that
you
never
regret
it
it
okay
said
ken
almost
gruffly
we
all
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
he
turned
as
a
figure
brushed
by
them
allen
pushed
through
the
crowd
to
the
doorway
he
looked
at
no
one
we
were
fools
said
tucker
bitterly
brainless
scared
fools
when
they
were
gone
aylesworth
put
his
hand
on
ken
shoulder
that
was
a
mighty
fine
thing
you
did
i
hope
it
sets
a
pattern
for
all
of
us
in
times
to
come
i
did
do
it
for
them
said
ken
i
did
it
for
myself
the
minister
smiled
and
clapped
the
boy
shoulder
again
nevertheless
you
did
it
that
what
counts
chapter
of
the
by
the
time
ken
was
through
with
the
ordeal
in
court
art
matthews
had
succeeded
in
building
an
engine
from
entirely
new
parts
he
had
it
installed
in
an
airtight
room
into
which
only
filtered
air
could
pass
this
room
and
another
air
filter
had
been
major
projects
in
themselves
the
science
club
members
had
done
most
of
the
work
after
their
daily
stint
at
the
laboratory
while
art
had
scoured
the
town
for
parts
that
would
fit
together
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
ken
went
to
the
garage
the
engine
had
been
running
for
hours
then
art
was
grinning
like
a
schoolboy
who
had
just
won
a
spelling
bee
she
sure
sounds
sweet
he
said
i
bet
we
can
keep
her
going
as
long
as
we
have
gasoline
i
hope
so
ken
said
it
just
a
waste
of
power
to
let
it
run
that
way
though
art
scratched
his
head
yeah
it
funny
power
is
what
we
been
wanting
and
now
we
got
a
little
we
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
let
see
if
we
can
find
a
generator
said
ken
charge
some
batteries
with
it
do
you
think
there
one
in
town
the
best
deal
i
can
think
of
would
be
to
scrounge
a
big
motor
say
an
elevator
motor
and
convert
it
the
one
belonging
to
the
elevator
in
the
norton
building
is
our
best
bet
i
do
imagine
it
froze
up
before
the
power
went
out
let
get
it
then
said
ken
shut
this
off
until
we
ready
to
use
it
to
be
on
the
safe
side
could
you
cast
some
new
bearings
for
the
generator
i
do
see
why
not
when
he
returned
home
ken
told
his
father
for
the
first
time
about
the
project
art
was
working
on
it
sounds
interesting
professor
maddox
said
i
not
sure
exactly
what
it
will
prove
ken
slumped
in
the
large
chair
in
the
living
room
weak
after
his
exertions
of
the
day
it
would
mean
that
if
we
could
find
enough
unfrozen
engines
or
could
assemble
them
from
spare
parts
we
could
get
some
power
equipment
in
operation
again
however
as
art
said
about
this
one
engine
what
good
is
it
dad
even
if
we
lick
this
problem
how
are
things
ever
going
to
get
started
up
again
what
do
you
mean
we
got
one
automobile
engine
going
pretty
soon
we
run
out
of
gas
here
in
mayfield
where
do
we
get
more
we
ca
until
the
railroad
can
haul
it
or
the
pipelines
can
pump
it
what
happens
when
the
stock
at
the
refineries
is
all
used
up
how
can
they
get
into
operation
again
they
need
power
for
their
own
plant
electricity
for
their
pumps
and
engines
all
of
their
frozen
equipment
has
to
be
replaced
maybe
some
of
it
will
have
to
be
manufactured
how
do
the
factories
and
plants
get
started
again
i
do
know
the
answers
to
all
that
ken
father
said
licking
the
comet
dust
only
half
the
problem
and
perhaps
the
smallest
half
at
that
our
economy
and
industry
will
have
to
start
almost
from
scratch
in
getting
underway
how
that
will
come
about
if
it
ever
does
i
do
not
know
to
conserve
their
ration
of
firewood
only
a
small
blaze
burned
in
the
fireplace
the
kitchen
and
living
room
were
being
heated
by
it
alone
the
rest
of
the
house
was
closed
off
we
ought
to
rig
up
something
else
ken
said
tiredly
that
wastes
too
much
heat
what
mom
cooking
on
mayor
hilliard
found
a
little
wood
burner
and
gave
it
to
me
i
had
time
to
try
converting
our
oil
furnace
ken
felt
unable
to
stay
awake
longer
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
for
a
few
hours
later
his
mother
brought
a
dinner
tray
do
you
want
it
here
or
would
you
rather
come
down
where
it
warm
she
asked
i
come
down
i
want
to
get
up
for
a
while
maria
is
out
in
the
shack
she
has
a
scheduled
contact
with
berkeley
but
she
says
the
transmitter
wo
function
it
looks
like
a
tube
to
her
she
wanted
to
call
joe
ken
scrambled
out
of
bed
and
grabbed
for
his
clothes
i
take
care
of
it
save
dinner
for
me
we
got
to
keep
the
station
on
the
air
no
matter
what
happens
he
found
maria
seated
by
the
desk
listening
to
the
berkeley
repeated
call
to
which
she
could
not
reply
the
girl
wore
a
heavy
cardigan
sweater
which
was
scarcely
sufficient
for
the
cold
in
the
room
the
small
heater
was
hardly
noticeable
maria
looked
up
as
ken
burst
through
the
doorway
i
did
want
you
to
come
she
said
they
could
have
called
joe
we
ca
risk
disturbing
our
schedule
they
might
think
we
gone
under
and
we
lose
our
contact
completely
hastily
he
examined
the
tube
layout
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
saw
it
was
merely
one
of
the
that
had
burned
a
filament
they
had
a
good
stock
of
spares
he
replaced
the
tube
and
closed
the
transmitter
cage
after
the
tubes
had
warmed
up
and
the
berkeley
operator
paused
to
listen
for
their
call
ken
picked
up
the
microphone
and
threw
in
the
antenna
switch
mayfield
calling
berkeley
he
repeated
this
several
times
our
transmitter
been
out
with
a
bum
bottle
let
us
know
if
you
read
us
now
he
repeated
again
and
switched
back
to
the
receiver
the
berkeley
operator
voice
indicated
his
relief
i
read
you
mayfield
i
hoped
you
had
gone
out
of
commission
the
eggheads
here
seem
to
think
your
combination
is
coming
up
with
more
dope
on
comet
dust
than
anybody
else
in
the
country
ken
grinned
and
patted
himself
and
maria
on
the
back
that
us
he
said
she
grimaced
at
him
hush
she
said
i
got
a
big
report
here
from
french
confirm
if
you
ready
to
tape
it
and
i
let
it
roll
maria
cut
in
to
confirm
that
they
were
receiving
and
ready
to
record
the
berkeley
operator
chuckled
as
he
came
back
that
the
one
i
like
to
hear
he
said
that
accent
is
real
cute
just
as
soon
as
things
get
rolling
again
i
coming
out
there
to
see
what
else
goes
with
it
he
an
idiot
maria
said
but
probably
a
pretty
nice
guy
ken
said
they
listened
carefully
as
the
berkeley
operator
read
a
number
of
pages
of
reports
by
french
and
his
associates
concerning
experiments
run
in
the
university
laboratories
these
gave
ken
a
picture
of
the
present
stage
of
the
work
on
the
comet
dust
he
felt
disheartened
although
the
material
had
been
identified
as
a
colloidal
compound
of
a
new
transuranic
metal
no
one
had
yet
been
able
to
determine
its
exact
chemical
structure
nor
involve
it
in
any
reaction
that
would
break
it
down
it
seemed
to
ken
that
one
of
the
biggest
drawbacks
was
lack
of
sufficient
sample
material
to
work
with
everything
they
were
doing
was
by
micromethods
he
supposed
it
was
his
own
lack
of
experience
and
his
clumsiness
in
the
techniques
that
made
him
feel
he
was
always
working
in
the
dark
when
trying
to
analyze
chemical
specimens
that
were
barely
visible
when
the
contact
was
completed
and
the
stations
signed
off
maria
told
ken
what
she
had
heard
over
the
air
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
hospital
several
other
amateur
operators
in
various
parts
of
the
country
had
heard
them
with
their
own
sets
they
had
asked
to
join
in
an
expanded
news
net
joe
and
al
had
agreed
to
this
and
ken
approved
as
he
heard
of
it
a
good
idea
i
was
hoping
to
reach
some
other
areas
maybe
we
can
add
some
industrial
laboratories
to
our
net
if
any
are
still
operating
we
got
three
said
maria
general
electric
in
schenectady
general
motors
in
detroit
and
hughes
in
california
amateurs
working
for
these
companies
called
in
they
all
working
on
the
dust
through
these
new
amateur
contacts
maria
had
learned
that
chicago
had
been
completely
leveled
by
fire
thousands
had
died
in
the
fire
and
in
the
rioting
that
preceded
it
new
york
city
had
suffered
almost
as
much
although
no
general
fire
had
broken
out
mob
riots
over
the
existing
scanty
food
supplies
had
taken
thousands
of
lives
other
thousands
had
been
lost
in
a
panicky
exodus
from
the
city
the
highways
leading
into
the
farming
areas
in
upstate
new
york
and
new
england
areas
were
clogged
with
starving
refugees
thousands
of
huddled
bodies
lay
under
the
snow
westward
into
pennsylvania
and
south
into
delaware
it
was
the
same
here
the
refugees
were
met
with
other
streams
of
desperate
humanity
moving
out
of
the
thickly
populated
cities
epidemics
of
disease
had
broken
out
where
the
starving
population
was
thickest
and
the
sanitary
facilities
poorest
on
the
west
coast
the
situation
was
somewhat
better
the
population
of
the
bay
area
was
streaming
north
and
south
toward
red
bluff
and
sacramento
and
into
the
salinas
and
san
joaquin
valleys
from
southern
california
they
were
moving
east
to
the
reclaimed
desert
farming
areas
there
were
suffering
and
death
among
them
but
the
rioting
and
mob
violence
were
less
from
all
over
the
country
there
were
increasing
reports
of
groups
of
wanderers
moving
like
nomadic
tribesmen
looting
killing
and
destroying
there
was
no
longer
any
evidence
of
a
central
government
capable
of
sufficient
communication
to
control
these
elements
of
the
population
on
even
a
local
basis
maria
played
the
tapes
of
these
reports
for
ken
she
seemed
stolid
and
beyond
panic
as
she
heard
them
again
to
ken
hearing
them
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
utterly
beyond
belief
it
was
simply
some
horror
story
played
on
the
radio
or
television
and
when
it
was
over
he
would
find
the
world
was
completely
normal
he
looked
up
and
saw
maria
watching
him
he
saw
the
little
stove
with
a
few
sticks
of
green
wood
burning
ineffectively
he
saw
the
large
rack
of
batteries
behind
the
transmitter
unexpectedly
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
he
thought
of
the
italian
steamship
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
the
he
said
to
maria
did
you
hear
anything
more
of
her
one
of
the
amateurs
told
me
he
picked
up
a
report
from
the
ship
about
a
week
ago
the
radio
operator
said
he
was
barricaded
in
the
radio
room
rioting
had
broken
out
all
over
the
ship
dozens
of
passengers
had
been
killed
the
ones
who
were
left
were
turning
cannibalistic
that
was
the
last
report
anyone
has
heard
from
the
ship
ken
shuddered
he
glanced
through
the
window
and
caught
a
vision
of
science
hall
on
college
hill
a
fortress
he
thought
there
were
maybe
a
dozen
other
such
fortresses
scattered
throughout
the
world
in
them
lay
the
only
hope
against
the
enemy
that
rampaged
across
the
earth
in
the
sky
he
could
see
the
comet
light
faintly
even
through
the
clouds
from
which
snow
was
falling
you
should
get
back
to
bed
said
maria
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
hit
two
hours
ago
instead
of
two
weeks
yeah
i
guess
i
better
ken
arose
feeling
weak
and
dizzy
can
you
get
that
report
typed
for
dad
tonight
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
be
able
to
take
it
to
the
lab
with
him
in
the
morning
i
get
it
done
said
maria
you
get
off
to
bed
as
much
as
he
rebelled
against
it
ken
was
forced
to
spend
the
next
two
days
in
bed
adams
allowed
him
to
be
up
no
more
than
a
few
hours
on
the
third
day
i
afraid
you
took
a
worse
beating
than
any
of
us
thought
the
doctor
said
you
just
have
to
coast
for
a
while
it
was
as
he
was
finally
getting
out
of
bed
again
that
he
heard
art
matthews
when
the
mechanic
came
to
the
door
and
spoke
with
mother
this
is
awfully
important
art
said
i
wish
you
ask
him
if
he
does
feel
like
seeing
me
for
just
a
minute
he
had
a
bad
relapse
and
the
doctor
says
he
has
to
be
kept
very
quiet
for
a
day
or
two
longer
dressed
except
for
his
shoes
ken
went
to
the
hall
and
leaned
over
the
stair
railing
i
be
down
in
just
a
minute
art
it
okay
mom
feeling
good
today
ken
you
should
his
mother
protested
in
a
moment
he
had
his
shoes
on
and
was
racing
down
the
stairs
happened
art
anything
gone
wrong
the
mechanic
looked
downcast
everything
we
got
the
norton
elevator
motor
and
hooked
it
up
with
the
gas
engine
it
ran
fine
for
a
couple
of
days
and
we
got
a
lot
of
batteries
charged
up
then
it
quit
said
ken
yeah
how
did
you
know
i
been
afraid
we
had
missed
one
bet
it
just
is
enough
to
supply
filtered
air
to
the
engines
built
of
new
parts
the
parts
themselves
are
already
contaminated
with
the
dust
as
soon
as
they
go
into
operation
we
have
the
same
old
business
all
over
again
unless
some
means
of
decontamination
can
be
found
these
new
parts
are
no
better
than
the
old
ones
some
of
these
parts
were
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
and
sealed
in
cardboard
boxes
art
protested
how
could
enough
dust
get
to
them
to
ruin
them
the
dust
has
a
way
of
getting
into
almost
any
corner
it
wants
to
said
ken
dad
and
the
others
have
found
it
has
a
tremendous
affinity
for
metals
so
it
seeps
through
cracks
and
sticks
it
never
moves
off
once
it
hits
a
piece
of
metal
what
parts
of
the
engine
froze
pistons
bearings
just
like
all
the
rest
the
generator
shaft
too
art
nodded
it
might
have
gone
a
few
more
revolutions
it
seemed
loose
when
we
started
work
but
as
soon
as
we
broke
the
bearings
apart
they
seemed
to
fasten
onto
the
shaft
like
they
were
alive
how
do
you
account
for
that
the
bearings
were
new
i
just
cast
them
yesterday
they
were
contaminated
by
dust
between
casting
and
installation
in
the
protected
room
we
got
to
dig
a
lot
deeper
before
we
got
the
right
answer
it
might
be
worthwhile
setting
up
another
rig
just
like
the
one
we
have
in
order
to
get
some
more
juice
in
our
batteries
do
you
think
you
could
do
it
again
or
even
several
times
that
engine
lasted
about
hours
did
it
altogether
i
suppose
i
could
do
it
again
if
you
think
it
worth
it
the
trouble
is
getting
generators
maybe
we
could
machine
the
shaft
of
this
one
and
cast
a
new
set
of
bearings
to
fit
i
try
if
you
think
it
worth
it
get
it
ready
to
run
said
ken
the
battery
power
for
our
radio
going
to
last
forever
we
be
in
a
real
jam
if
we
lose
touch
with
the
outside
chapter
animals
are
that
night
ken
reported
to
his
father
the
fate
of
the
engine
assembled
by
art
it
did
seem
too
good
to
be
true
said
professor
maddox
he
stretched
wearily
in
the
large
chair
by
the
feeble
heat
of
the
fireplace
it
bears
out
our
observation
of
the
affinity
of
the
dust
for
metals
how
is
that
it
attaches
itself
almost
like
a
horde
of
microscopic
magnets
it
literally
burrows
into
the
surface
of
the
metal
you
do
mean
that
i
do
its
presence
breaks
down
the
surface
tension
as
we
had
supposed
the
substance
actually
then
works
its
way
into
the
interstices
of
the
molecules
as
the
colloid
increases
in
quantity
its
molecules
loosen
the
bond
between
the
molecules
of
the
metal
giving
them
increased
freedom
of
motion
this
can
be
aggravated
by
frictional
contacts
and
finally
we
have
the
molecular
interchange
that
binds
the
two
pieces
into
one
the
only
metal
that
would
be
clean
would
be
that
which
had
been
hermetically
sealed
since
before
the
appearance
of
the
comet
said
ken
look
would
this
affinity
of
the
dust
for
metal
provide
a
means
of
purifying
the
atmosphere
if
we
could
run
the
air
through
large
filters
of
metal
wool
the
dust
would
be
removed
yes
i
very
sure
we
could
do
it
that
way
it
would
merely
require
that
we
run
the
atmosphere
of
the
whole
earth
through
such
a
filter
do
you
have
any
idea
how
that
could
be
done
it
would
work
in
the
laboratory
but
would
be
wholly
impractical
on
a
worldwide
scale
ken
admitted
how
will
we
ever
rid
the
atmosphere
of
the
dust
a
colloid
will
float
forever
in
the
air
even
after
the
comet
is
gone
exactly
professor
maddox
said
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
earth
is
permanently
poisoned
our
problem
is
to
process
it
in
some
manner
to
remove
that
poison
during
the
past
few
days
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
only
two
alternatives
one
is
to
process
the
whole
atmosphere
by
passing
it
through
some
device
such
as
the
filter
you
have
suggested
the
second
is
to
put
some
substance
into
the
air
which
will
counteract
and
destroy
the
dust
precipitate
it
out
of
the
atmosphere
since
the
first
method
is
impractical
what
can
be
used
in
carrying
out
the
second
we
set
ourselves
the
goal
of
discovering
that
we
hoping
to
synthesize
the
necessary
chemical
compound
to
accomplish
it
it
would
have
to
be
a
colloid
too
capable
of
suspension
in
the
atmosphere
said
ken
correct
if
we
do
find
such
a
substance
we
still
have
the
problem
of
decontaminating
existing
metals
we
could
build
a
moving
piece
of
machinery
out
of
any
metal
now
in
existence
without
first
cleaning
the
dust
out
of
its
surface
that
part
of
the
problem
too
said
his
father
ken
resumed
his
duties
in
the
laboratory
the
following
morning
adams
had
warned
him
not
to
walk
up
college
hill
so
he
had
borrowed
the
horse
dave
whitaker
still
had
on
loan
from
his
uncle
he
felt
about
being
the
only
one
enjoying
such
luxury
but
he
promised
himself
he
would
go
back
to
walking
as
soon
as
adams
gave
permission
on
the
third
day
the
horse
slipped
and
fell
as
it
picked
its
way
carefully
down
the
hill
ken
was
thrown
clear
into
the
deep
snow
but
the
horse
lay
where
it
had
fallen
as
if
unable
to
move
ken
feared
the
animal
had
broken
a
leg
he
felt
cautiously
but
could
find
no
evidence
of
injury
gently
he
tugged
at
the
reins
and
urged
the
horse
to
its
feet
the
animal
finally
rose
but
it
stood
uncertainly
and
trembled
when
it
tried
to
walk
again
ken
walked
rather
than
rode
the
rest
of
the
way
home
he
took
the
horse
to
the
improvised
stable
beside
the
science
shack
there
he
got
out
the
ration
of
hay
and
water
and
put
a
small
amount
of
oats
in
the
trough
the
animal
ignored
the
food
and
drink
after
dinner
ken
went
out
again
to
check
the
horse
was
lying
down
in
the
stall
and
the
food
remained
untouched
ken
returned
to
the
house
and
said
to
his
father
dave
horse
slipped
today
and
i
afraid
something
serious
is
wrong
with
him
he
seem
to
have
any
broken
bones
but
he
wo
eat
or
get
up
i
think
i
should
go
for
the
vet
his
father
agreed
we
ca
afford
to
risk
a
single
horse
considering
how
precious
they
are
now
you
stay
in
the
house
and
i
go
to
smithers
place
myself
ken
protested
he
hated
to
see
his
father
go
out
again
on
such
a
cold
night
smithers
grumbled
when
professor
maddox
reached
his
house
and
explained
what
he
wanted
as
one
of
the
town
two
veterinarians
he
had
been
heavily
overworked
since
the
disaster
struck
the
slightest
sign
of
injury
or
illness
in
an
animal
caused
the
mayor
livestock
committee
to
call
for
help
probably
nothing
but
a
strained
ligament
smithers
said
you
could
have
taken
care
of
it
by
wrapping
it
yourself
we
think
you
ought
to
come
when
the
veterinarian
finally
reached
the
side
of
the
animal
he
inspected
him
carefully
by
the
light
of
a
gasoline
lantern
the
horse
was
lying
on
his
side
in
a
bed
of
hay
he
was
breathing
heavily
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
glassy
smithers
sucked
his
breath
in
sharply
and
bent
closer
finally
he
got
to
his
feet
and
stared
out
over
the
expanse
of
snow
it
be
he
muttered
we
just
do
deserve
that
we
do
deserve
it
at
all
what
is
it
ken
asked
anxiously
is
it
something
very
serious
i
do
know
for
sure
it
looks
like
it
could
be
anthrax
i
just
afraid
that
it
is
smithers
eyes
met
and
held
professor
maddox
ken
did
not
understand
i
heard
that
name
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
one
of
the
most
deadly
diseases
of
animals
spreads
like
wildfire
when
it
gets
a
start
it
can
infect
human
beings
too
how
could
it
happen
here
there
has
been
a
case
of
anthrax
in
the
valley
for
years
i
remember
dave
whitaker
saying
his
uncle
got
two
new
horses
from
a
farmer
near
britton
just
a
week
before
the
comet
said
ken
maybe
it
could
have
come
from
there
perhaps
said
smithers
what
can
we
do
asked
professor
maddox
ca
we
start
a
program
of
vaccination
to
keep
it
from
spreading
how
much
anthrax
vaccine
do
you
suppose
there
is
in
the
whole
town
before
we
decide
anything
i
want
to
get
hart
and
make
some
tests
if
he
agrees
with
me
we
got
to
get
hold
of
the
mayor
and
the
council
and
decide
on
a
course
of
action
tonight
hart
was
the
other
veterinarian
a
younger
man
inclined
to
look
askance
at
smithers
older
techniques
i
just
as
soon
take
your
word
said
professor
maddox
if
you
think
we
ought
to
take
action
let
do
it
i
want
hart
here
first
said
smithers
he
a
but
got
a
good
head
and
good
training
in
spite
of
it
someday
he
be
a
good
man
and
you
need
one
after
i
gone
i
go
said
ken
you
already
been
out
dad
it
only
or
blocks
and
i
feel
fine
well
if
you
feel
strong
enough
said
his
father
hesitantly
fatigue
was
obvious
in
his
face
hart
was
asleep
when
ken
pounded
on
his
door
he
persisted
until
the
veterinarian
came
sleepily
and
rebelliously
ken
told
his
story
quickly
hart
grunted
in
a
surly
voice
anthrax
that
fool
smithers
probably
would
know
a
case
of
anthrax
if
it
stared
him
in
the
face
tell
him
to
give
your
horse
a
shot
of
terramycin
and
i
come
around
in
the
morning
if
i
went
out
on
every
scare
i
never
get
any
sleep
hart
ken
said
quietly
you
know
what
it
means
if
it
is
anthrax
the
veterinarian
blinked
under
ken
accusing
stare
all
right
he
said
finally
but
if
smithers
is
getting
me
out
on
a
chase
i
run
him
out
of
town
smithers
and
professor
maddox
were
still
beside
the
ailing
horse
when
ken
returned
with
hart
no
one
spoke
a
word
as
they
came
up
hart
went
to
work
on
his
examination
ken
holding
the
lantern
for
him
here
a
carbuncle
right
back
of
the
ear
he
said
accusingly
anybody
notice
this
earlier
i
afraid
not
ken
admitted
i
guess
i
have
taken
very
good
care
of
him
ken
been
in
the
hospital
professor
maddox
said
i
know
hart
answered
irritably
but
i
think
anybody
would
have
noticed
this
carbuncle
these
infections
are
characteristic
there
not
much
question
about
what
it
is
but
we
ought
to
get
a
smear
and
make
a
microscope
slide
check
of
it
i
got
a
instrument
said
ken
if
that
good
enough
you
can
use
it
hart
nodded
get
some
sterile
slides
afterward
smithers
said
we
got
to
get
jack
nelson
first
and
find
out
how
much
anthrax
vaccine
he
got
in
his
store
nobody
else
in
town
will
have
any
except
maybe
some
of
his
customers
who
may
have
bought
some
lately
what
about
the
college
laboratories
do
they
have
any
i
do
know
said
professor
maddox
we
have
to
contact
bintz
for
that
let
get
at
it
said
hart
we
got
to
wake
up
the
mayor
and
the
council
the
cattle
committee
will
have
to
be
there
nelson
and
bintz
too
we
find
out
how
much
vaccine
we
got
and
decide
what
to
do
with
it
two
hours
later
the
men
met
in
the
council
chambers
of
city
hall
because
of
the
lack
of
heat
they
retained
their
overcoats
and
sheepskin
jackets
the
incrusted
snow
on
their
boots
did
not
even
soften
in
soberness
and
shock
they
listened
to
smithers
nobody
grows
up
in
a
farming
community
without
knowing
what
anthrax
means
he
said
we
got
a
total
of
hundred
head
of
beef
and
dairy
cattle
in
the
valley
plus
a
couple
of
thousand
sheep
and
about
a
hundred
horses
jack
nelson
stock
of
vaccine
plus
what
he
thinks
may
be
in
the
hands
of
his
customers
plus
some
at
the
college
is
enough
to
treat
about
a
thousand
animals
altogether
those
that
are
treated
will
have
to
be
slaughtered
if
they
prove
to
be
uninfected
they
can
be
processed
for
meat
storage
some
vaccine
will
have
to
be
held
in
reserve
but
if
we
do
clean
up
the
valley
before
next
year
calf
crop
we
wo
stand
a
chance
of
increasing
our
herds
that
the
situation
we
up
against
gentlemen
mayor
hilliard
arose
the
only
question
seems
to
me
to
be
which
animals
are
of
most
worth
to
us
i
say
we
should
let
all
the
sheep
go
a
cow
or
a
horse
is
worth
more
than
a
sheep
to
us
now
that
leaves
the
question
of
the
horses
which
is
worth
more
to
us
a
horse
or
a
cow
we
ca
haul
logs
without
horses
but
we
wo
need
to
worry
about
staying
warm
if
we
have
got
food
enough
harry
mason
of
the
fuel
committee
stood
up
immediately
i
say
we
got
to
keep
every
horse
we
got
it
would
be
crazy
to
give
any
of
them
up
there
are
enough
now
to
haul
the
fuel
we
need
a
horse
is
a
poor
trade
for
a
cow
in
these
times
protested
the
food
committee
chief
paul
remington
every
cow
you
let
go
means
milk
for
two
or
three
families
it
means
a
calf
for
next
year
meat
supply
we
can
freeze
and
still
stay
alive
we
ca
starve
and
do
the
same
thing
i
say
let
every
horse
in
the
valley
go
keep
the
cows
and
beef
cattle
an
instant
hubbub
arose
loudly
protesting
or
approving
these
two
extreme
views
mayor
hilliard
pounded
on
the
desk
for
order
we
got
to
look
at
both
sides
of
the
question
he
said
when
the
confusion
had
died
down
i
know
there
are
some
horses
we
can
lose
without
much
regret
they
do
haul
as
much
as
they
eat
what
paul
says
however
is
true
every
horse
we
keep
means
trading
it
for
a
cow
and
the
food
a
cow
can
provide
i
think
we
need
to
keep
some
horses
but
it
ought
to
be
the
bare
minimum
i
got
an
idea
about
this
log
hauling
right
now
and
for
a
long
time
to
come
we
do
need
horses
once
the
logs
are
on
the
road
it
a
downgrade
all
the
way
to
town
when
the
road
freezes
hard
we
can
coast
a
sled
all
the
way
if
we
rig
a
way
to
steer
and
brake
it
properly
there
are
only
two
bad
curves
coming
out
of
the
canyon
and
i
think
we
can
figure
a
way
to
take
care
of
them
maybe
a
team
at
each
one
this
would
leave
most
of
the
horses
free
to
snake
the
logs
out
of
the
hills
to
the
road
i
for
cutting
the
horses
to
selecting
the
best
breeding
stock
we
got
and
including
the
ones
needed
for
emergency
riding
such
as
the
sheriff
has
for
another
hour
it
was
argued
back
and
forth
but
in
the
end
the
mayor
plan
was
adopted
then
aylesworth
who
had
not
previously
spoken
during
the
whole
meeting
arose
quietly
i
think
there
something
we
forgetting
gentlemen
he
said
something
we
forgotten
all
along
now
that
we
are
faced
with
our
most
serious
crisis
yet
i
suggest
that
you
members
of
our
city
government
pass
a
resolution
setting
aside
the
next
sabbath
as
a
special
day
of
prayer
ask
the
ministers
of
all
our
denominations
to
in
offering
special
prayer
services
for
the
safety
of
our
animals
which
we
need
so
badly
and
for
the
success
of
those
who
are
working
on
college
hill
and
elsewhere
to
find
a
solution
to
this
grave
problem
mayor
hilliard
nodded
approvingly
we
should
have
done
it
long
ago
he
agreed
if
no
one
has
any
objections
i
will
so
declare
as
aylesworth
has
suggested
there
were
nods
of
approval
from
everyone
in
the
room
by
dawn
the
next
morning
the
crews
were
ready
to
begin
the
vaccination
program
one
by
one
they
examined
the
animals
to
make
sure
the
best
were
saved
the
rest
were
slaughtered
examined
for
signs
of
anthrax
and
most
were
prepared
for
storage
on
sunday
while
the
cattle
crews
still
worked
ken
and
his
parents
attended
services
in
aylesworth
congregation
a
solemnity
was
over
the
whole
valley
and
the
only
sound
anywhere
seemed
to
be
the
tolling
of
the
bells
in
the
churches
the
anthrax
outbreak
had
seemed
to
the
people
of
mayfield
one
more
and
perhaps
a
final
proof
that
their
hope
of
survival
was
beyond
all
realization
before
with
severe
rationing
it
had
seemed
that
they
would
need
a
miracle
to
get
them
through
the
winter
now
with
the
brutally
lessened
supply
of
milk
and
breeding
cattle
it
seemed
beyond
the
power
of
any
miracle
aylesworth
white
mane
behind
the
pulpit
was
like
a
symbol
testifying
that
they
never
need
give
up
hope
as
long
as
any
desire
for
life
was
in
them
in
himself
there
seemed
no
doubt
of
their
eventual
salvation
and
in
his
sermon
he
pleaded
with
them
to
maintain
their
strength
and
hope
and
faith
in
his
prayer
he
asked
father
bless
our
cattle
and
our
beasts
of
burden
that
this
illness
that
has
stricken
them
may
be
healed
bless
us
that
our
hearts
may
not
fail
us
in
this
time
of
trial
but
teach
us
to
bear
our
burdens
that
we
may
give
thanks
unto
thee
when
the
day
of
our
salvation
doth
come
amen
chapter
by
late
november
some
drifts
of
snow
on
the
flats
were
feet
deep
the
temperature
dropped
regularly
to
ten
or
more
below
zero
at
night
and
seldom
went
above
freezing
in
the
daytime
the
level
of
the
log
pile
in
the
woodyard
dropped
steadily
in
spite
of
the
concentrated
efforts
of
nearly
every
available
man
in
the
community
to
add
to
it
crews
cut
all
night
long
by
the
light
of
gasoline
lanterns
the
fuel
ration
had
to
be
lowered
to
meet
their
rate
of
cutting
the
deep
snow
hampered
mayor
hilliard
plan
to
sled
the
logs
downhill
without
use
of
teams
criticisms
and
grumblings
at
his
decision
to
sacrifice
the
horses
grew
swiftly
there
had
been
no
more
signs
of
anthrax
and
some
were
saying
the
whole
program
of
vaccination
and
slaughter
had
been
a
stupid
mistake
in
spite
of
the
assurance
of
the
veterinarians
that
it
was
the
only
thing
that
could
have
been
done
the
grumbling
went
on
like
a
rolling
wave
as
the
severity
of
the
winter
increased
the
council
was
finally
forced
to
issue
a
conservation
order
requiring
families
to
double
up
two
to
a
house
on
the
theory
that
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
heat
one
house
than
parts
of
two
selection
of
family
pairings
was
optional
close
friends
and
relatives
moved
together
wherever
possible
where
no
selection
was
made
the
committee
assigned
families
to
live
together
as
soon
as
the
order
was
issued
ken
mother
suggested
they
invite
the
larsens
to
move
in
with
them
the
swedish
family
was
happy
to
accept
thanksgiving
when
it
came
was
observed
in
spirit
but
scarcely
in
fact
there
were
some
suggestions
that
mayor
hilliard
should
order
special
rations
for
that
day
and
for
christmas
at
least
but
he
stuck
to
his
ironhard
determination
that
every
speck
of
food
would
be
stretched
to
the
limit
no
special
allowance
would
be
made
for
thanksgiving
or
any
other
occasion
until
the
danger
was
over
ken
and
his
father
and
their
friends
had
done
their
share
of
criticizing
the
mayor
in
the
past
but
they
now
had
only
increasing
admiration
for
his
determination
to
take
a
stand
for
the
principles
he
knew
to
be
right
no
matter
how
stern
previously
most
of
the
townspeople
had
considered
him
very
good
at
giving
highly
patriotic
fourth
of
july
speeches
and
not
much
good
at
anything
else
now
ken
realized
the
bombastic
little
man
seemed
to
have
come
alive
fully
and
miraculously
alive
the
day
after
thanksgiving
ken
and
professor
maddox
were
greeted
by
maddox
upon
coming
home
maria
wants
you
to
come
to
the
radio
shack
right
away
she
said
there
something
important
coming
in
from
berkeley
they
hurried
to
the
shack
and
maria
looked
up
in
relief
as
they
entered
i
so
glad
you
here
she
cried
french
is
on
the
radio
personally
i
been
recording
him
but
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
he
breaking
in
every
minutes
to
give
me
a
chance
to
let
him
know
if
you
here
it
almost
time
now
ken
and
his
father
caught
a
fragment
of
a
sentence
spoken
by
the
berkeley
scientist
and
then
the
operator
came
on
berkeley
requesting
acknowledgment
mayfield
ken
picked
up
the
microphone
and
answered
this
is
mayfield
ken
maddox
talking
my
father
is
here
and
will
speak
with
dr
french
professor
maddox
sat
down
at
the
desk
this
is
professor
maddox
he
said
i
came
in
time
to
hear
your
last
sentence
french
they
tell
me
you
have
something
important
to
discuss
please
go
ahead
ken
switched
over
to
receive
and
in
a
moment
the
calm
persuasive
voice
of
french
was
heard
in
the
speaker
i
glad
you
came
in
maddox
he
said
on
the
tape
you
have
my
report
of
some
experiments
we
have
run
the
last
few
days
they
are
not
finished
and
if
circumstances
were
normal
i
would
certainly
not
report
a
piece
of
work
in
this
stage
i
feel
optimistic
however
that
we
are
on
the
verge
of
a
substantial
breakthrough
in
regard
to
the
precipitant
we
are
looking
for
i
would
like
you
to
repeat
the
work
i
have
reported
and
go
on
from
there
using
your
own
ideas
i
wanted
you
to
have
it
along
with
the
people
in
pasadena
in
case
anything
should
happen
here
in
my
opinion
it
could
be
only
a
matter
of
days
until
we
have
a
solution
i
certainly
hope
you
are
right
said
professor
maddox
why
do
you
speak
of
the
possibility
of
something
happening
is
there
trouble
yes
rioting
has
broken
out
repeatedly
in
the
entire
bay
area
during
the
past
days
food
supplies
are
almost
at
the
university
here
those
of
us
remaining
have
our
families
housed
in
classrooms
we
have
some
small
stock
of
food
but
it
not
enough
for
an
indefinite
stay
the
rioting
may
sweep
over
us
the
lack
of
food
may
drive
us
out
before
we
can
finish
you
are
in
a
better
position
there
for
survival
purposes
i
hope
nothing
happens
to
interrupt
your
work
our
local
government
is
crumbling
fast
they
have
attempted
to
supply
the
community
with
seafood
but
there
are
not
enough
sailing
vessels
perhaps
of
the
population
have
migrated
some
have
returned
thousands
have
died
i
feel
our
time
is
limited
give
my
report
your
careful
attention
and
let
me
know
your
opinion
tomorrow
they
broke
contact
uneasiness
filling
the
hearts
of
listeners
in
mayfield
up
to
now
the
berkeley
scientist
had
seemed
impassive
and
utterly
objective
now
to
hear
him
speak
of
his
own
personal
disaster
induced
in
them
some
of
his
own
premonition
of
collapse
when
maria
had
typed
the
report
professor
maddox
stayed
up
until
the
hours
studying
it
developing
equations
and
making
calculations
of
his
own
ken
stayed
with
him
trying
to
follow
the
abstruse
work
and
follow
his
father
explanations
when
he
finished
professor
maddox
was
enthusiastic
i
believe
he
on
the
right
track
he
said
unfortunately
he
has
told
all
he
knows
in
this
report
he
must
have
been
too
excited
about
the
work
ordinarily
he
leaves
nothing
out
but
he
omitted
three
or
four
important
steps
near
the
end
i
have
to
ask
him
to
fill
them
in
before
we
can
do
very
much
with
his
processes
the
report
was
read
and
discussed
at
the
college
laboratory
the
next
day
and
the
scientists
began
preliminary
work
to
duplicate
results
ken
and
his
father
hurried
home
early
in
order
to
meet
the
afternoon
schedule
with
berkeley
and
get
french
to
the
microphone
to
answer
the
questions
he
had
neglected
to
consider
as
they
arrived
at
the
radio
shack
and
opened
the
door
they
found
maria
inside
with
her
head
upon
the
desk
deep
sobs
shook
her
body
the
receiver
was
on
but
only
the
crackle
of
static
came
from
it
the
filaments
of
the
transmitter
tubes
were
lit
but
the
antenna
switch
was
open
the
tape
recorder
was
still
running
professor
maddox
grasped
maria
by
the
shoulders
and
drew
her
back
in
the
chair
what
is
the
matter
he
exclaimed
why
are
you
crying
maria
it
all
over
she
said
there
nothing
more
down
there
just
nothing
what
do
you
mean
ken
cried
it
on
the
tape
you
can
hear
it
for
yourself
ken
quickly
reversed
the
tape
and
turned
it
to
play
in
a
moment
the
familiar
voice
of
their
berkeley
friend
was
heard
i
glad
early
it
said
there
is
much
time
today
the
thing
french
feared
has
happened
half
the
bay
area
is
in
flames
on
the
campus
here
the
administration
building
is
gone
they
tried
to
blow
up
the
science
building
burning
pretty
fast
in
the
other
wing
i
on
the
third
floor
did
i
ever
tell
you
i
moved
my
stuff
over
here
to
be
close
to
the
lab
there
must
be
a
mob
of
a
hundred
thousand
out
there
in
the
streets
or
rather
several
hundred
mobs
that
add
up
to
that
many
none
of
them
know
where
they
going
it
like
a
monster
with
a
thousand
separate
heads
cut
loose
to
thrash
about
before
it
dies
i
see
groups
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
running
through
the
streets
burning
and
smashing
things
sometimes
they
meet
another
group
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
then
they
fight
until
the
majority
of
one
group
is
dead
and
the
others
have
run
away
the
scientists
were
having
a
meeting
here
until
an
hour
ago
they
gathered
what
papers
and
notes
they
could
and
agreed
that
each
would
try
to
make
his
own
way
with
his
family
out
of
the
city
they
agreed
to
try
to
meet
in
salinas
weeks
from
now
if
possible
i
do
think
any
of
them
will
ever
meet
again
a
sudden
tenseness
surged
into
the
operator
voice
i
can
see
him
down
there
he
cried
in
despair
french
he
running
across
the
campus
with
a
load
of
books
and
a
case
of
his
papers
and
they
trying
to
get
him
he
on
the
brow
of
a
little
hill
and
the
mob
is
down
below
they
laughing
at
him
and
shooting
they
almost
look
like
college
students
he
down
they
got
him
a
choking
sob
caught
the
operator
voice
that
all
there
is
he
said
i
hope
you
can
do
something
with
the
information
french
gave
you
yesterday
berkeley
is
finished
i
going
to
try
to
get
out
of
here
myself
now
i
do
think
i
stand
much
of
a
chance
the
mobs
are
swarming
all
over
the
campus
i
can
hear
the
fire
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
maybe
i
wo
even
make
it
outside
tell
the
professor
and
ken
so
long
i
sure
wish
i
could
have
made
it
to
mayfield
to
see
what
goes
with
that
swedish
accent
yl
after
dinner
professor
maddox
announced
his
intention
of
going
back
to
the
laboratory
maddox
protested
vigorously
i
could
sleep
even
if
i
went
to
bed
he
said
thinking
about
what
happened
today
in
berkeley
what
if
a
thing
like
that
happened
here
larsen
asked
with
concern
it
we
in
a
much
better
position
than
the
metropolitan
areas
said
professor
maddox
i
think
we
manage
if
we
can
keep
our
people
from
getting
panicky
it
easier
too
because
there
are
so
many
of
us
professor
larsen
went
back
to
the
laboratory
with
the
maddoxes
throughout
the
night
they
reviewed
the
work
of
french
to
ken
it
seemed
that
they
were
using
material
out
of
the
past
since
all
of
those
responsible
for
it
were
probably
dead
we
have
to
fill
in
these
missing
steps
said
professor
maddox
we
know
what
he
started
with
and
we
know
the
end
results
at
which
he
was
aiming
i
think
we
can
fill
the
gaps
i
agree
said
professor
larsen
i
think
we
should
not
neglect
to
pass
this
to
our
people
in
stockholm
you
will
see
that
is
done
he
asked
ken
our
next
schedule
in
that
area
is
day
after
tomorrow
or
i
could
get
it
to
them
on
the
emergency
watch
tomorrow
afternoon
use
emergency
measures
i
think
it
is
of
utmost
importance
that
they
have
this
quickly
as
the
days
passed
strangers
were
appearing
more
and
more
frequently
in
mayfield
ken
saw
them
on
the
streets
as
he
went
to
the
warehouse
for
his
family
food
ration
he
did
not
know
everyone
who
lived
in
the
valley
of
course
but
he
was
sure
some
of
the
people
he
was
meeting
now
were
total
strangers
and
there
seemed
so
many
of
them
he
had
heard
stories
of
how
some
of
them
had
come
one
by
one
or
in
small
groups
of
a
family
or
two
they
had
made
their
way
from
cities
to
the
north
or
the
south
along
the
highway
that
passed
through
the
valley
they
had
come
in
rags
out
of
the
blizzards
to
the
unexpected
sanctuary
of
a
town
that
still
retained
a
vestige
of
civilization
unexpectedly
ken
found
this
very
subject
was
being
discussed
in
the
ration
lines
when
he
reached
the
warehouse
people
had
in
their
hands
copies
of
the
mimeographed
newssheet
put
out
by
the
council
across
the
top
in
capital
letters
was
the
word
proclamation
ken
borrowed
a
sheet
and
read
according
to
the
latest
count
we
made
through
the
ration
roll
there
are
now
present
in
mayfield
almost
three
thousand
people
who
are
refugees
from
other
areas
and
have
come
in
since
the
beginning
of
the
disaster
as
great
as
our
humanitarian
feelings
are
and
although
we
should
like
to
be
able
to
relieve
the
suffering
of
the
whole
world
if
it
were
in
our
power
to
do
so
it
is
obviously
impossible
our
food
supplies
are
at
mere
subsistence
level
now
before
next
season
crops
are
in
it
may
be
necessary
to
reduce
them
still
further
in
view
of
this
fact
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
have
determined
to
issue
a
proclamation
as
of
this
date
that
every
citizen
of
mayfield
will
be
registered
and
numbered
and
no
rations
will
be
issued
except
by
proper
identification
and
number
it
is
hereby
ordered
that
no
one
hereafter
shall
permit
the
entrance
of
any
stranger
who
was
not
a
resident
of
mayfield
prior
to
this
date
a
inclosure
is
to
be
constructed
around
the
entire
residential
and
business
district
and
armed
guards
will
be
posted
against
all
refugees
who
may
attempt
to
enter
crews
will
be
assigned
to
the
erection
of
the
fence
and
guard
duty
will
be
rotated
among
the
male
citizens
ken
passed
the
sheet
back
to
his
neighbor
his
mind
felt
numb
as
he
thought
of
some
of
those
he
had
seen
shuffling
through
the
deep
snow
in
town
he
knew
now
how
he
had
known
they
were
strangers
their
pinched
haunted
faces
showed
the
evidence
of
more
privation
and
hardship
than
any
in
mayfield
had
yet
known
these
were
the
ones
who
would
be
turned
away
from
now
on
ken
heard
the
angry
buzz
of
comments
all
around
him
should
have
done
it
long
ago
a
plump
woman
somewhere
behind
him
was
saying
what
right
have
they
got
to
come
in
and
eat
our
food
a
man
at
the
head
of
the
line
was
saying
they
ought
to
round
them
all
up
and
make
them
move
on
three
thousand
that
would
keep
the
people
who
got
a
right
here
going
a
long
time
someone
else
not
quite
so
angry
said
they
people
just
like
us
you
know
what
the
bible
says
about
that
we
ought
to
share
as
long
as
we
can
yeah
and
pretty
soon
there
wo
be
anything
for
anybody
to
share
that
may
be
true
but
it
what
we
supposed
to
do
it
what
to
do
if
we
going
to
stay
human
i
take
anybody
into
my
house
who
knocks
on
my
door
when
you
see
your
kids
crying
for
food
you
ca
give
them
change
your
tune
just
ahead
of
him
in
line
ken
saw
a
small
silent
woman
who
looked
about
with
darting
glances
of
fear
she
was
trembling
with
fright
as
much
as
with
the
cold
that
penetrated
her
thin
ragged
cloth
coat
she
was
one
of
them
ken
thought
she
was
one
who
had
come
from
the
outside
he
wondered
which
of
the
ones
beside
him
would
be
willing
to
be
the
first
to
take
her
beyond
the
bounds
of
mayfield
and
force
her
to
move
on
that
night
at
dinner
he
spoke
of
it
to
his
parents
and
the
larsens
it
a
problem
that
has
to
be
faced
said
professor
maddox
and
hilliard
is
choosing
the
solution
he
thinks
is
right
he
no
more
heartless
than
aylesworth
for
example
it
seems
a
horrible
thing
said
larsen
what
will
happen
to
those
who
are
turned
away
they
will
die
said
larsen
they
will
go
away
and
wander
in
the
snow
until
they
die
why
should
we
have
any
more
right
to
live
than
they
asked
maddox
how
can
we
go
on
eating
and
being
comfortable
while
they
are
out
there
are
out
there
in
the
whole
world
said
larsen
as
if
meditating
there
must
be
thirty
million
who
have
died
in
the
united
states
alone
since
this
began
another
hundred
million
will
die
this
winter
the
proportion
will
be
the
same
in
the
rest
of
the
world
should
we
be
thankful
for
our
preservation
so
far
or
should
we
voluntarily
join
them
in
death
this
is
different
said
maddox
it
those
who
come
and
beg
for
our
help
who
will
be
on
our
consciences
if
we
do
this
thing
the
whole
world
would
come
if
it
knew
we
had
stores
of
food
here
if
it
could
come
as
brutal
as
it
is
the
mayor
has
taken
the
only
feasible
course
open
to
him
ken
and
maria
remained
silent
both
feeling
the
horror
of
the
proposal
and
its
inevitability
in
the
following
days
ken
was
especially
glad
to
be
able
to
bury
himself
in
the
problems
at
the
laboratory
his
father
too
seemed
to
work
with
increasing
fury
as
they
got
further
into
an
investigation
of
the
material
originated
by
french
as
if
seized
by
some
fanatic
compulsion
unable
to
stop
professor
maddox
spent
from
to
hours
of
every
day
at
his
desk
and
laboratory
bench
ken
stayed
with
him
although
he
could
not
match
his
father
great
energy
he
often
caught
snatches
of
sleep
while
his
father
worked
on
then
one
morning
as
an
especially
long
series
of
complex
tests
came
to
an
end
at
he
said
to
ken
in
quiet
exultation
we
can
decontaminate
now
if
nothing
else
that
the
thing
that
french
had
found
whether
we
can
ever
put
it
into
the
atmosphere
is
another
matter
but
at
least
we
can
get
our
metals
clean
excited
ken
leaned
over
the
notebook
while
his
father
described
the
results
of
the
reaction
he
studied
the
photographs
taken
with
the
electron
microscope
of
a
piece
of
steel
before
and
after
treatment
with
a
compound
developed
by
his
father
ken
said
slowly
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
french
did
do
this
dad
most
of
it
i
finished
it
up
from
where
he
left
off
no
he
was
even
on
the
same
track
you
gone
in
an
entirely
different
direction
from
the
one
his
research
led
to
are
the
one
who
has
developed
a
means
of
cleaning
the
dust
out
of
metals
professor
maddox
looked
away
you
give
me
too
much
credit
son
ken
continued
to
look
at
his
father
at
the
thick
notebook
whose
scrawled
symbols
told
the
story
so
this
is
the
way
it
happens
he
thought
you
do
set
out
to
be
a
great
scientist
at
all
if
you
can
put
all
other
things
out
of
your
mind
if
you
can
be
absorbed
with
your
whole
mind
and
soul
in
a
problem
that
seems
important
enough
even
though
the
world
is
collapsing
about
your
head
then
if
you
are
clever
enough
and
persevering
enough
you
may
find
yourself
a
great
scientist
without
ever
having
tried
i
do
think
i
ever
be
what
the
world
calls
a
great
scientist
professor
maddox
had
said
on
that
day
that
seemed
so
long
ago
i
not
clever
enough
i
do
think
fast
enough
i
can
teach
the
fundamentals
of
chemistry
and
maybe
some
of
those
i
teach
will
be
great
someday
so
he
had
gone
along
ken
thought
and
by
applying
his
own
rules
he
had
achieved
greatness
i
think
you
give
me
far
too
much
credit
son
he
said
in
a
tired
voice
chapter
out
of
town
it
took
a
surprisingly
short
time
to
ring
mayfield
with
a
barricade
a
large
stock
of
steel
fence
posts
was
on
hand
in
the
local
farm
supply
stores
and
these
could
be
driven
rapidly
even
in
the
frozen
ground
there
was
plenty
of
wire
what
more
was
needed
both
of
wire
and
posts
was
taken
from
adjacent
farmland
fences
and
by
the
end
of
the
week
following
the
mayor
pronouncement
the
task
was
completed
and
the
guards
were
at
their
posts
in
all
that
time
there
had
been
no
occasion
to
turn
anyone
away
but
sentiment
both
for
and
against
the
program
was
heavy
and
bitter
within
the
community
on
the
sunday
after
completion
of
the
fence
aylesworth
chose
to
speak
of
it
in
his
sermon
he
had
advertised
that
he
would
do
so
the
church
was
not
only
packed
but
large
numbers
of
people
stood
outside
in
the
freezing
weather
listening
through
the
doors
even
greater
excitement
was
stirred
by
the
whispered
information
that
mayor
hilliard
was
sitting
in
the
center
of
the
congregation
the
minister
had
titled
his
sermon
my
brother
keeper
he
opened
by
saying
am
i
my
brother
keeper
we
know
the
answer
to
that
question
my
friends
for
all
the
thousands
of
years
that
man
has
been
struggling
upward
he
has
been
developing
the
answer
to
that
question
we
know
it
even
though
we
may
not
always
abide
by
it
we
know
who
our
brothers
are
all
mankind
whether
in
asia
or
in
europe
or
next
door
to
our
own
home
these
are
our
brothers
as
he
elaborated
on
the
theme
ken
thought
that
this
was
his
belief
which
she
had
expressed
when
the
fence
was
first
mentioned
we
can
not
help
those
in
distant
lands
said
aylesworth
as
much
as
our
hearts
go
out
to
them
and
are
touched
with
compassion
at
their
plight
we
can
do
nothing
for
them
for
those
on
our
own
doorstep
however
it
is
a
different
matter
we
are
being
told
now
by
our
civil
authorities
in
this
community
that
we
must
drive
away
at
the
point
of
a
gun
any
who
come
holding
out
their
hands
for
succor
and
shelter
we
are
told
we
must
drive
them
away
to
certain
death
i
tell
you
if
we
do
this
thing
no
matter
what
the
outcome
of
our
present
condition
we
shall
never
be
able
to
look
one
another
in
the
eye
we
shall
never
be
able
to
look
at
our
own
image
without
remembering
those
whom
we
turned
away
when
they
came
to
us
for
help
i
call
upon
you
to
petition
our
civil
authorities
to
remove
this
brutal
and
inhumane
restriction
in
order
that
we
may
be
able
to
behave
as
the
civilized
men
and
women
we
think
we
have
become
although
faced
with
disaster
we
are
not
yet
without
a
voice
in
our
own
actions
and
those
who
have
made
this
unholy
ruling
can
be
persuaded
to
relent
if
the
voices
of
the
people
are
loud
enough
he
sat
down
amid
a
buzz
of
whispered
comment
then
all
eyes
turned
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
a
new
voice
in
the
hall
mayor
hilliard
was
on
his
feet
and
striding
purposefully
toward
the
pulpit
reverend
you
had
your
say
and
now
i
think
i
got
a
right
to
have
mine
i
know
this
is
your
bailiwick
and
you
can
ask
me
to
leave
if
you
want
to
however
these
are
my
people
six
days
a
week
to
your
one
will
you
let
me
say
my
piece
aylesworth
rose
again
a
smile
of
welcome
on
his
face
i
think
we
share
the
people
or
rather
they
share
us
on
all
days
of
the
week
he
said
i
will
be
happy
to
have
you
use
this
pulpit
to
deliver
any
message
you
may
care
to
thanks
said
mayor
hilliard
as
he
mounted
the
platform
and
stood
behind
the
pulpit
aylesworth
and
i
he
began
have
been
good
friends
for
a
long
time
we
usually
see
eye
to
eye
on
most
things
but
in
this
we
are
dead
opposite
what
he
says
is
true
enough
if
enough
of
you
want
to
protest
what
done
you
can
have
a
change
but
that
change
will
have
to
include
a
new
mayor
and
a
new
set
of
councilmen
i
was
elected
and
the
council
was
elected
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
welfare
of
this
community
as
long
as
we
were
in
office
we
made
this
rule
about
allowing
no
more
refugees
in
mayfield
and
it
going
to
stand
as
long
as
we
in
office
by
next
summer
if
the
harvest
is
even
a
few
days
late
your
children
are
going
to
be
standing
around
crying
for
food
you
ca
give
them
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
cut
your
supplies
to
their
normal
size
that
the
way
it
adds
up
after
we
count
all
the
people
in
the
valley
and
all
the
cases
and
sacks
of
food
in
the
warehouses
it
just
plain
arithmetic
if
we
keep
adding
more
people
we
all
going
to
get
closer
and
closer
to
starvation
and
finally
wake
up
one
morning
and
find
we
gone
over
the
edge
of
it
now
if
that
what
you
want
just
go
ahead
and
get
some
city
officers
who
will
arrange
it
for
you
if
anybody
in
this
town
including
you
aylesworth
can
think
of
a
more
workable
answer
or
one
that
makes
better
sense
than
the
one
we
got
i
like
to
know
about
it
it
snowed
heavily
that
afternoon
out
of
a
bitter
leaden
sky
it
started
in
the
midst
of
the
morning
service
and
by
the
time
the
congregation
dispersed
it
was
difficult
to
see
a
block
away
there
was
little
comment
about
what
they
had
heard
among
the
people
leaving
the
church
they
walked
with
heads
bowed
against
the
snow
toward
their
cold
homes
and
sparsely
filled
pantries
the
community
chapel
was
near
the
edge
of
town
one
of
the
boundary
fences
lay
only
two
blocks
away
from
that
direction
as
the
crowd
dispersed
there
came
the
sudden
sound
of
a
shot
it
was
muffled
under
the
heavy
skies
and
the
dense
snow
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sound
ken
jerked
his
head
sharply
that
must
have
been
one
of
the
guards
he
said
his
father
nodded
together
they
raced
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
others
began
running
too
their
hearts
pounding
in
anticipation
of
some
crisis
that
might
settle
the
unanswered
questions
ken
noticed
ahead
of
them
through
the
veil
of
snow
the
chunky
figure
of
mayor
hilliard
running
as
rapidly
as
he
could
as
they
came
to
the
fence
they
saw
the
guard
standing
on
one
side
his
rifle
lowered
and
ready
on
the
other
side
of
the
enclosure
was
a
stout
man
he
wore
an
overcoat
but
there
was
no
hat
on
his
head
his
face
was
drawn
with
agony
and
uncomprehending
despair
he
staggered
on
his
feet
as
he
pleaded
in
a
tired
voice
you
got
to
let
me
come
in
i
walked
all
the
way
in
this
blizzard
i
have
had
any
food
for
two
days
a
group
of
churchgoers
lined
the
fence
now
additional
ones
coming
up
slowly
almost
reluctantly
but
knowing
they
had
to
witness
what
was
about
to
take
place
ken
exclaimed
hoarsely
to
his
father
that
sam
baker
he
runs
the
drugstore
and
newsstand
in
frederick
everybody
in
mayfield
knows
sam
baker
sam
baker
turned
in
bewildered
helpless
pleading
to
the
crowd
lined
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
mayor
hilliard
stood
back
a
dozen
yards
from
the
wire
you
got
to
help
me
sam
baker
begged
you
ca
make
me
go
back
all
that
way
it
miles
there
nothing
there
they
all
dead
or
lost
in
the
snow
give
me
something
to
eat
please
you
got
to
move
on
the
guard
said
mechanically
nobody
gets
in
that
the
law
here
along
the
fence
people
pressed
close
and
one
or
two
men
started
hesitantly
to
climb
mayor
hilliard
voice
rang
out
anybody
who
goes
on
the
other
side
of
that
fence
on
the
other
side
the
men
climbed
down
no
one
said
anything
sam
baker
scanned
them
with
his
helpless
glance
once
more
then
he
turned
slowly
fifty
feet
from
the
fence
he
fell
in
the
snow
face
down
mayor
hilliard
spoke
slowly
and
clearly
once
more
if
anyone
so
much
as
throws
a
crust
of
bread
over
that
fence
the
guard
has
orders
to
shoot
as
if
frozen
the
onlookers
remained
immobile
the
guard
held
his
fixed
stance
mayor
hilliard
stood
feet
apart
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
defiantly
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
the
thick
flakes
of
snow
were
rapidly
covering
the
inert
form
of
sam
baker
in
only
a
few
moments
he
would
be
obliterated
from
their
sight
that
would
be
the
signal
for
them
all
to
turn
and
go
home
ken
thought
impulsively
he
took
a
step
forward
he
looked
at
his
father
face
dad
professor
maddox
touched
ken
arm
with
a
restraining
hand
his
face
was
grim
and
churned
by
conflicting
desires
the
utter
stillness
was
broken
then
by
the
crunching
sound
of
boots
in
the
snow
all
eyes
turned
to
the
powerful
figure
that
approached
aylesworth
was
hatless
and
the
snow
was
thick
in
his
hair
he
paused
a
moment
comprehending
the
situation
then
he
strode
forward
to
the
fence
he
put
a
foot
on
the
wire
and
climbed
his
coat
caught
on
the
barbs
as
he
jumped
to
the
other
side
he
ripped
it
free
ignoring
the
tear
of
the
fabric
mayor
hilliard
watched
as
if
hypnotized
he
jerked
himself
finally
out
of
his
immobility
parson
he
cried
come
back
here
aylesworth
ignored
the
command
he
strode
forward
with
unwavering
steps
it
no
different
with
you
than
it
is
with
any
other
man
hilliard
shouted
he
took
the
gun
from
the
guard
you
breaking
the
law
if
you
do
stop
i
shoot
the
majestic
figure
of
the
minister
turned
he
faced
hilliard
without
hesitation
shoot
he
said
he
turned
back
and
moved
once
more
to
the
fallen
druggist
there
was
sweat
on
mayor
hilliard
face
now
he
brushed
it
with
a
gloved
hand
his
hat
fell
unnoticed
to
the
ground
he
raised
the
gun
no
higher
aylesworth
he
called
and
his
voice
was
pleading
now
got
to
do
what
right
the
minister
voice
came
back
to
him
hollowly
as
if
from
an
immense
distance
yes
we
got
to
do
what
right
aylesworth
could
be
seen
faintly
through
the
veil
of
snow
as
he
bent
down
raising
the
druggist
heavy
form
to
his
own
back
in
a
fireman
carry
then
turning
to
retrace
his
steps
mayor
hilliard
let
the
gun
sag
in
his
hands
at
the
fence
aylesworth
paused
separate
those
wires
he
ordered
those
standing
near
they
hastily
obeyed
pressing
their
feet
on
the
lower
wire
raising
the
center
one
take
him
the
minister
commanded
he
rolled
the
figure
of
sam
baker
gently
through
the
opening
and
crawled
through
himself
bring
him
to
my
house
he
said
without
a
glance
at
the
mayor
he
strode
off
through
the
parted
crowd
and
disappeared
one
by
one
the
onlookers
followed
slowly
never
glancing
at
the
immobile
figure
of
the
mayor
hilliard
watched
the
last
of
them
fade
into
the
snow
curtain
and
he
stood
there
alone
still
holding
the
gun
in
his
hand
the
guard
came
up
at
last
do
you
want
me
to
keep
on
here
mr
hilliard
i
still
say
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
said
maddox
at
the
dinner
table
how
could
anyone
claim
to
be
human
and
think
of
leaving
poor
baker
lying
there
in
the
snow
it
was
the
only
thing
aylesworth
could
do
said
professor
maddox
mayor
hilliard
did
the
only
thing
could
do
which
was
right
and
which
was
wrong
i
do
think
any
of
us
are
really
sure
any
more
what
do
you
suppose
may
come
of
this
asked
professor
larsen
i
do
know
ken
father
admitted
there
a
lot
of
excitement
in
town
a
fellow
named
meggs
is
stirring
up
talk
against
hilliard
the
storekeeper
who
tried
to
hold
a
profiteering
sale
you
remember
i
heard
there
were
some
fights
in
town
after
church
said
maria
ken
nodded
yes
i
heard
about
them
too
it
must
start
here
exclaimed
larsen
that
must
be
the
way
it
began
in
chicago
and
berkeley
we
ca
let
it
happen
here
during
the
next
few
days
a
kind
of
unspoken
truce
seemed
to
reign
over
the
town
it
was
rumored
that
both
mayor
hilliard
and
aylesworth
were
waiting
for
the
other
to
come
for
a
talk
but
that
neither
was
willing
to
go
first
under
the
circumstances
orders
had
been
given
that
sam
baker
was
to
get
no
special
ration
he
would
get
only
what
others
shared
with
him
out
of
their
own
meager
allotment
in
the
laboratory
on
college
hill
it
was
confirmed
that
professor
maddox
had
indeed
discovered
a
completely
effective
means
of
cleansing
metals
of
the
destroying
dust
art
matthews
and
the
science
club
boys
were
once
again
scouring
the
town
for
engine
parts
that
could
be
cleaned
and
used
in
assembling
new
and
this
time
workable
engines
on
friday
morning
professor
douglas
came
in
late
after
all
the
others
had
been
there
for
a
couple
of
hours
he
was
panting
from
his
rapid
walk
up
the
hill
have
you
heard
the
news
he
exclaimed
the
others
looked
up
what
news
professor
maddox
asked
a
couple
of
farmers
and
ranchers
from
the
south
end
of
the
valley
rode
in
about
this
morning
they
were
they
said
their
places
and
several
others
had
been
attacked
last
night
everything
in
the
whole
southern
part
of
the
valley
beyond
the
point
has
been
looted
and
burned
six
families
still
living
on
their
own
places
were
wiped
out
who
did
it
professor
larsen
exclaimed
nomads
the
ranchers
say
there
a
band
of
over
three
thousand
camped
down
by
turnerville
about
miles
from
here
they
been
moving
across
the
country
killing
and
looting
everything
that
in
their
way
now
they
headed
for
mayfield
they
heard
about
us
having
a
big
cache
of
supplies
all
work
in
the
laboratory
ceased
as
the
men
gathered
around
professor
douglas
they
stared
into
the
distance
but
their
thoughts
were
alike
three
thousand
said
professor
maddox
slowly
we
could
put
twice
that
many
good
men
against
them
we
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
them
off
if
they
attack
what
hilliard
doing
about
it
he
wants
us
all
down
there
this
morning
there
does
seem
to
be
much
question
about
him
staying
on
as
mayor
since
this
came
up
in
a
group
the
men
left
the
experiments
and
made
their
way
down
the
hill
to
the
city
hall
when
they
arrived
they
found
the
council
chamber
already
filled
the
mayor
and
the
councilmen
were
at
their
conference
table
on
the
platform
in
front
of
the
room
at
one
side
facing
both
the
leaders
and
the
audience
were
three
ragged
unshaven
strangers
in
heavy
boots
and
coats
they
had
not
bothered
to
remove
the
caps
from
their
heads
nomads
ken
thought
it
was
apparent
what
was
going
on
we
coming
in
the
center
man
was
saying
his
massive
size
and
strength
showed
even
under
the
thick
covering
of
clothes
i
say
coming
in
and
we
either
come
peaceable
and
you
treat
us
right
or
we
come
in
our
own
way
it
does
make
much
difference
to
us
how
we
do
it
you
just
call
the
shots
mister
and
we
play
it
your
way
we
got
two
thousand
armed
men
who
know
how
to
shoot
fast
and
straight
because
they
done
a
lot
of
it
the
last
two
months
they
the
ones
that
shot
faster
and
straighter
than
the
guys
they
were
shooting
at
you
want
to
live
here
peaceably
with
us
is
that
it
questioned
mayor
hilliard
the
man
laughed
harshly
why
sure
we
peaceful
people
are
we
men
he
took
reassurance
from
his
grinning
companions
just
as
peaceful
as
them
around
us
how
about
those
ranch
families
you
murdered
last
night
the
speaker
laughed
again
they
did
want
peace
did
they
men
all
we
asked
for
was
a
little
something
to
eat
and
they
started
an
argument
with
us
we
just
do
like
arguments
mayor
hilliard
glanced
beyond
the
table
to
the
first
row
of
listeners
his
glance
fell
upon
aylesworth
before
giving
my
consent
to
your
coming
in
he
said
slowly
i
like
to
hear
from
one
of
our
more
prominent
citizens
this
is
aylesworth
one
of
our
ministers
would
you
like
to
tell
these
people
how
we
feel
about
their
proposal
reverend
the
minister
rose
slowly
his
eyes
never
leaving
the
three
nomads
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
tell
them
then
to
the
three
he
said
you
can
go
right
back
where
you
came
from
that
our
answer
to
your
proposal
the
big
man
snarled
so
that
the
way
you
want
it
is
it
well
then
we
be
back
and
when
we
come
you
wish
you
sung
a
different
tune
mayor
hilliard
smiled
a
wry
smile
i
did
expect
our
minister
to
be
quite
so
unfeeling
of
your
plight
since
i
am
in
agreement
with
his
views
however
i
must
say
that
you
will
not
be
back
because
you
are
not
going
anywhere
sheriff
arrest
these
men
instantly
the
big
man
dropped
his
hand
to
his
pocket
before
his
gun
was
halfway
out
a
shot
rang
from
the
rear
doorway
of
the
crowded
room
the
stranger
dropped
to
the
platform
like
a
crumpled
bull
you
covered
said
hilliard
to
the
other
two
you
came
here
with
a
white
flag
but
it
had
our
people
blood
all
over
it
we
are
not
violating
any
truce
because
this
is
not
an
affair
of
honor
among
gentlemen
it
going
to
be
only
an
extermination
of
wild
beasts
chapter
the
two
nomads
stood
glaring
and
snarling
before
the
drawn
revolvers
that
pointed
at
them
from
the
doorways
of
the
room
for
an
instant
it
looked
as
if
they
were
going
to
draw
their
own
weapons
and
make
a
pitched
battle
of
it
right
there
in
the
council
chamber
then
their
glances
fell
on
their
comrade
writhing
in
pain
on
the
floor
they
raised
their
hands
in
slow
surrender
if
we
not
back
by
sundown
you
be
wiped
out
when
will
the
attack
begin
if
you
do
go
back
asked
hilliard
bitterly
two
hours
before
sundown
we
thank
you
for
the
information
about
your
timetable
at
least
we
have
hours
to
prepare
a
defense
of
the
town
he
nodded
to
the
policeman
take
them
away
put
them
in
cells
and
tie
them
up
until
this
is
over
when
they
had
been
removed
he
turned
back
to
the
group
i
had
nightmares
he
said
and
this
has
been
one
of
them
i
guess
if
i
had
been
the
mayor
some
people
think
i
ought
to
have
been
we
would
have
been
drilling
and
rehearsing
our
defenses
for
weeks
i
had
planned
to
do
so
soon
i
thought
we
have
more
time
that
my
only
excuse
the
sheriff
and
i
have
done
a
little
preliminary
planning
and
thinking
we
made
an
estimate
of
weapons
available
from
what
jack
nelson
and
dan
sims
report
on
hunting
licenses
issued
locally
a
year
ago
there
must
be
about
two
thousand
deer
rifles
in
town
they
also
guess
about
four
or
five
hundred
we
lucky
to
live
in
hunting
country
dan
and
jack
have
about
two
hundred
guns
of
all
kinds
and
sizes
in
their
rental
and
selling
stock
and
they
got
nearly
all
the
ammunition
in
the
valley
they
had
stocked
up
for
the
hunting
season
which
we
never
had
this
year
so
their
supply
sounds
as
if
it
would
be
pretty
good
you
got
to
remember
the
difference
in
requirements
for
bagging
a
deer
and
carrying
on
a
war
we
have
very
little
ammunition
when
you
consider
it
from
that
angle
the
police
of
course
have
a
few
guns
and
some
rounds
i
placing
sheriff
johnson
in
full
charge
of
defense
the
police
officers
will
act
as
his
lieutenants
the
mayor
stepped
to
a
wall
chart
that
showed
the
detailed
topography
of
mayfield
and
its
environs
this
is
your
battle
map
right
here
sheriff
come
up
and
start
marking
off
your
sectors
of
the
defense
perimeter
and
name
your
officers
to
take
charge
of
each
i
hope
somebody
is
going
to
say
it
a
good
thing
we
got
the
defense
line
before
this
meeting
is
over
i
want
a
rider
to
leave
at
once
to
bring
back
the
wood
detail
all
their
horses
will
be
turned
over
to
the
police
officers
for
use
in
their
commands
i
want
fifty
runners
to
go
through
town
and
notify
one
man
in
each
block
to
mobilize
his
neighbors
with
all
weapons
available
and
lead
them
to
the
sectors
which
the
sheriff
will
designate
each
man
will
bring
all
the
ammunition
he
owns
additional
stores
will
be
distributed
by
wagon
to
the
sectors
above
everything
else
each
man
must
be
warned
to
make
each
shot
count
the
room
was
silent
and
there
was
no
protest
or
disagreement
mayor
hilliard
the
man
who
had
made
fancy
speeches
seemed
to
have
vanished
hilliard
the
dynamic
leader
had
taken
his
place
for
a
moment
no
one
in
the
room
was
more
surprised
than
hilliard
himself
there
one
thing
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
he
said
after
a
pause
you
people
who
are
working
at
the
laboratory
on
college
hill
are
to
keep
away
from
the
and
away
from
all
possible
danger
that
an
order
you
understand
no
said
professor
maddox
abruptly
it
our
duty
as
much
as
anyone
else
to
share
in
the
defenses
it
your
duty
to
keep
your
skins
whole
and
get
back
into
the
laboratories
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
get
things
running
again
we
have
any
special
desire
to
save
your
necks
in
preference
to
our
own
but
in
the
long
run
you
the
only
hope
any
of
us
has
got
remember
that
and
stay
out
of
trouble
the
sheriff
made
his
appointments
in
sequence
naming
many
who
were
not
present
ordering
messengers
sent
to
them
ken
volunteered
to
ride
after
the
wood
detail
i
guess
it
safe
enough
to
let
you
do
that
the
mayor
said
make
it
fast
but
do
break
your
neck
i
take
it
easy
ken
promised
outside
he
selected
the
best
of
the
three
police
horses
and
headed
up
out
of
town
over
the
brittle
snow
with
its
glare
of
the
comet
when
he
was
on
higher
ground
he
glanced
back
over
the
length
of
the
valley
the
nomads
were
not
in
sight
not
in
force
anyway
he
thought
he
glimpsed
a
small
movement
a
mile
or
two
away
from
the
barrier
at
the
south
end
of
the
valley
before
it
turned
out
of
sight
at
the
point
but
he
was
sure
once
he
thought
he
heard
a
rifle
shot
but
he
was
sure
of
that
either
as
he
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
clearing
mark
wilson
foreman
of
the
detail
frowned
irritably
and
paused
in
his
task
of
snaking
a
log
out
to
the
road
you
ruin
that
horse
besides
breaking
your
neck
riding
like
that
in
this
snow
you
not
on
detail
anyway
get
all
your
men
and
horses
up
here
right
away
ken
said
orders
to
get
back
to
town
at
once
he
told
briefly
the
story
of
what
had
happened
mark
wilson
did
not
hesitate
he
raised
a
whistle
to
his
lips
and
signaled
for
the
men
to
cease
work
and
assemble
one
by
one
they
began
to
appear
from
among
the
trees
the
horses
were
led
along
their
dragging
harnesses
clanking
in
the
frozen
air
we
could
cut
for
more
hours
they
protested
no
use
wasting
this
daylight
and
having
to
cut
by
lantern
never
mind
said
wilson
there
something
else
to
do
wait
for
the
rest
when
all
had
assembled
he
jerked
his
head
toward
ken
go
ahead
he
said
you
tell
them
ken
repeated
in
detail
everything
that
had
happened
he
outlined
the
mayor
plan
of
defense
and
passed
on
the
order
for
them
to
take
all
mounts
to
city
hall
to
go
by
their
own
homes
on
the
way
and
pick
up
such
weapons
as
they
owned
you
get
your
further
orders
there
he
finished
the
group
was
silent
as
if
they
could
not
believe
it
was
actually
happening
mark
wilson
broke
the
spell
that
seemed
to
be
over
them
come
on
he
cried
get
the
lead
out
of
your
shoes
and
let
get
down
there
sunset
the
deadline
there
was
a
rush
of
motion
then
they
hitched
up
the
necessary
teams
and
climbed
aboard
the
sleds
there
was
no
excitement
or
swearing
against
fate
and
their
enemies
rather
a
solemn
stillness
seemed
to
fill
each
man
as
the
sleds
moved
off
down
the
hard
frozen
roadway
almost
but
not
quite
the
same
pervading
stillness
was
present
in
the
town
when
ken
returned
there
was
a
stirring
of
frantic
activity
like
that
of
a
disturbed
anthill
but
it
was
just
as
silent
the
runners
moved
from
block
to
block
in
their
wake
the
alarmed
block
leaders
raced
weapons
in
hand
from
house
to
house
arousing
their
neighbors
many
who
had
already
completed
the
block
mobilization
were
moving
in
ragged
formations
to
the
sector
ordered
by
the
block
runner
according
to
sheriff
johnson
plan
ken
did
not
know
what
was
planned
for
the
many
weaponless
men
who
were
being
assembled
they
would
be
useless
at
the
frontline
there
was
need
for
some
at
the
rear
he
supposed
johnson
would
take
care
of
that
later
when
every
weapon
was
manned
at
the
defense
barrier
he
stopped
at
his
own
house
his
mother
greeted
him
anxiously
he
could
see
she
had
been
crying
but
she
had
dried
her
tears
now
and
was
reconciled
to
the
inevitable
struggle
that
was
at
hand
your
father
came
in
a
few
minutes
ago
and
left
again
she
said
been
placed
in
charge
of
distribution
of
medical
supplies
under
adams
he
wants
you
and
the
other
boys
of
the
club

in
arranging

be
careful
sure
mom
maria
got
her
coat
larsen
let
her
go
without
protest
but
the
two
women
watched
anxiously
as
the
young
people
rode
toward
town
on
the
police
horse
at
the
doctor
office
ken
found
his
father
surrounded
by
an
orderly
whirl
of
activity
ken
i
was
hoping
you
get
back
soon
you
can
help
with
arrangements
for
hospital
care
in
assigned
homes
the
rest
of
your
friends
are
out
on
their
streets
take
this
set
of
instructions
adams
has
prepared
and
see
that
arrangements
are
made
in
exact
accordance
with
them
at
each
house
on
the
list
i
can
help
too
said
maria
yes
adams
has
prepared
a
list
of
women
and
girls
he
wants
to
assign
as
nurses
and
aides
you
can
help
contact
them
get
the
ones
on
this
list
to
meet
here
as
quickly
as
possible
and
they
be
assigned
to
the
houses
which
the
boys
are
lining
up
the
comet
was
setting
earlier
now
so
that
its
unnatural
light
disappeared
almost
as
soon
as
the
sun
set
below
the
horizon
in
the
short
period
of
twilight
tension
grew
in
the
city
everything
possible
had
been
done
to
mount
defenses
an
attack
had
been
promised
if
the
nomad
emissaries
did
not
return
now
the
time
had
come
darkness
fell
with
no
sign
of
activity
in
any
direction
it
seemed
unreasonable
that
any
kind
of
night
attack
would
be
launched
but
hilliard
and
johnson
warned
their
men
not
to
relax
their
vigilance
the
pace
of
preparatory
activity
continued
blankets
clothing
and
food
were
brought
to
the
men
who
waited
along
the
defense
perimeter
medical
arrangements
were
perfected
as
much
as
possible
ken
and
his
father
made
their
quarters
in
another
room
of
the
building
where
adams
office
was
there
was
no
heat
of
course
but
they
had
brought
sleeping
bags
which
were
unrolled
on
the
floor
after
the
sandwiches
were
gone
their
rations
were
canned
soup
to
be
eaten
directly
from
the
can
without
being
heated
maria
was
quartered
elsewhere
in
the
building
with
some
of
the
women
who
were
directing
the
nurses
activities
through
the
windows
could
be
seen
the
campfires
which
johnson
had
permitted
to
be
built
at
the
guard
posts
each
had
a
wall
of
snow
ready
to
be
pushed
upon
it
in
case
of
any
sign
of
attack
we
better
get
some
sleep
professor
maddox
said
finally
to
ken
they
take
care
of
anything
that
going
to
happen
out
there
tonight
we
may
have
a
rough
day
tomorrow
ken
agreed
although
he
did
not
feel
like
sleeping
after
hours
it
seemed
of
thrashing
restlessly
he
dozed
off
he
thought
it
was
dawn
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
to
the
faint
red
glow
reflected
on
the
walls
of
the
room
he
was
unaware
for
a
moment
of
where
he
was
then
he
saw
the
glow
was
flickering
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
the
window
in
the
distance
the
glow
of
burning
houses
lit
the
landscape
the
rapid
crack
of
rifle
fire
came
faintly
to
his
ears
professor
maddox
was
beside
him
how
could
they
do
it
ken
exclaimed
how
could
they
get
through
our
lines
and
set
fire
to
the
houses
on
the
southern
sector
of
the
defense
line
sheriff
johnson
men
crouched
behind
their
improvised
defenses
the
glow
of
the
fire
blinded
them
as
they
attempted
to
pierce
the
darkness
from
which
the
attack
was
coming
from
a
different
points
fireballs
were
being
lobbed
out
of
the
darkness
ineffective
on
the
roofs
many
others
crashed
through
the
windows
and
rolled
on
the
floors
inside
such
targets
became
flaming
infernos
within
minutes
they
were
all
unoccupied
because
the
inhabitants
had
been
moved
closer
to
the
center
of
town
for
protection
a
fusillade
of
shots
poured
out
of
the
darkness
upon
the
defenders
they
answered
the
fire
shooting
at
the
pinpoints
of
light
that
betrayed
the
enemy
position
and
at
the
spots
in
the
darkness
from
which
the
flaming
fireballs
came
it
was
obvious
that
the
attackers
were
continuously
moving
it
was
difficult
to
know
where
the
launching
crews
of
the
fireball
catapults
were
actually
located
in
that
overwhelming
darkness
sheriff
johnson
was
on
the
scene
almost
at
once
he
had
once
been
an
infantry
lieutenant
with
combat
experience
his
presence
boosted
the
morale
of
the
defenders
immediately
hold
your
fire
he
ordered
the
men
keep
under
cover
and
wait
until
you
can
see
something
worth
shooting
at
try
to
keep
the
fire
from
spreading
and
watch
for
a
rush
attack
do
waste
ammunition
find
yourselves
without
any
if
you
keep
that
up
reluctantly
they
ceased
firing
and
fell
back
to
the
protection
of
their
barricades
patrolman
john
sykes
who
was
lieutenant
of
the
sector
had
been
in
the
national
guard
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
do
you
think
they
rush
us
he
asked
tonight
i
mean
in
the
dark
who
knows
they
may
be
crazy
enough
to
try
anything
keep
your
eyes
open
the
flames
quickly
burned
out
the
interiors
of
the
houses
that
had
been
hit
as
the
roofs
crashed
in
their
burden
of
snow
assisted
in
putting
out
the
fires
and
there
was
no
spreading
to
nearby
houses
in
his
room
ken
dressed
impatiently
it
was
useless
to
try
to
sleep
any
more
i
wish
they
let
us
go
out
there
he
said
we
got
as
much
right
as
johnson
or
any
of
the
rest
his
father
remained
a
motionless
silhouette
against
the
distant
firelight
as
much
right
perhaps
he
said
but
more
and
different
responsibilities
hilliard
is
right
if
we
were
knocked
down
out
there
who
would
take
over
the
work
in
the
laboratory
johnson
adams
in
berkeley
there
are
thousands
fighting
each
other
but
with
french
and
his
group
gone
no
one
is
fighting
the
comet
i
do
think
it
is
selfish
to
say
we
are
of
infinitely
more
value
in
the
laboratory
than
we
could
ever
be
out
there
with
guns
in
our
hands
he
turned
and
smiled
in
the
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
you
have
the
merit
badge
for
marksmanship
and
won
the
hunting
club
trophy
last
year
after
an
hour
the
attack
ceased
apparently
because
the
defenders
refused
to
waste
their
fire
on
the
impossible
targets
sheriff
johnson
sent
word
around
for
his
men
to
resume
rotation
of
watch
and
get
all
the
sleep
possible
before
the
day
that
was
ahead
of
them
the
fires
burned
themselves
out
shortly
before
dawn
their
light
was
followed
soon
by
the
glow
of
the
comet
rising
in
the
southeast
ken
watched
it
and
thought
of
granny
wicks
it
would
be
hard
he
thought
to
understand
how
a
belief
in
omens
could
arise
it
would
be
hard
at
all
the
sky
had
cleared
so
that
the
light
of
the
comet
bathed
the
entire
countryside
in
its
full
bitter
glory
at
sunrise
the
faint
trickles
of
smoke
rose
from
hundreds
of
wood
fires
started
with
the
difficult
green
fuel
and
stringent
breakfasts
were
prepared
a
thought
went
through
ken
mind
and
he
wondered
if
anybody
was
taking
note
of
the
supply
of
matches
in
town
when
they
ran
low
coals
of
one
fire
would
have
to
be
kept
to
light
another
it
was
on
a
day
when
ordinarily
school
bells
would
have
been
sounding
throughout
the
valley
the
first
war
shouts
of
the
attacking
nomads
were
heard
on
the
plain
to
the
south
about
thirty
men
on
horseback
raced
single
file
along
the
highway
that
bore
the
hard
frozen
tracks
of
horses
and
sleds
that
had
moved
to
and
from
the
farms
down
there
patrolman
sykes
watched
them
through
his
glasses
his
command
rang
out
to
his
company
hold
fire
he
knew
the
nomads
would
not
hope
to
break
through
the
barbed
wire
on
such
a
rush
it
looked
as
if
they
planned
an
attack
as
the
line
began
breaking
in
a
slow
curve
something
less
than
yards
away
fire
sykes
commanded
volleys
of
shots
rang
out
on
both
sides
almost
simultaneously
the
lead
rider
of
the
nomads
went
down
his
horse
galloping
in
riderless
panic
at
the
head
of
the
line
the
column
paralleled
the
barrier
for
yards
drawing
the
fire
of
adjacent
guard
posts
before
they
broke
and
turned
south
again
it
was
evidently
a
test
of
the
strength
of
the
defenses
every
shot
counts
sykes
cried
out
to
his
men
as
the
attackers
rode
out
of
effective
range
he
sighted
four
riderless
horses
beside
him
in
the
barricade
one
of
his
own
men
was
hit
and
bleeding
badly
a
tourniquet
was
prepared
until
two
men
of
the
medical
detail
arrived
with
an
improvised
stretcher
sykes
sat
down
and
rested
his
head
on
his
arms
for
a
moment
the
air
was
well
below
freezing
but
his
face
was
bathed
with
sweat
how
long
he
asked
himself
silently
how
long
can
it
go
on
first
the
comet
then
this
he
roused
at
a
sudden
cry
beside
him
they
coming
back
a
man
shouted
sykes
stood
up
and
raised
his
fieldglasses
to
his
eyes
from
around
the
point
a
fresh
group
of
riders
was
pouring
toward
the
town
at
least
three
times
as
many
as
before
in
a
flash
he
understood
their
intent
they
going
to
come
through
he
cried
they
going
to
come
right
through
the
barrier
no
matter
what
it
costs
them
chapter
the
nomad
cavalry
bore
down
on
the
defense
line
they
did
not
break
into
a
circling
column
as
before
i
but
began
forming
an
advancing
line
when
they
were
yards
away
sykes
ordered
his
men
to
begin
firing
the
nomads
were
already
shooting
and
what
their
emissary
had
said
was
true
these
men
were
expert
shots
even
from
horseback
sykes
heard
the
bullets
careening
off
the
sloping
face
of
the
barricade
two
of
his
men
were
down
already
he
leveled
his
police
pistol
and
fired
steadily
into
the
oncoming
ranks
he
thought
they
were
going
to
try
to
jump
the
fence
this
time
and
he
braced
for
the
shock
to
his
dismay
he
now
saw
that
a
perfectly
clear
space
for
their
landing
had
been
left
between
his
own
position
and
the
adjacent
barricade
suddenly
the
line
of
attackers
swerved
to
the
left
just
a
few
feet
from
the
wire
the
defending
fire
was
furious
and
for
a
moment
sykes
thought
they
were
going
to
turn
the
line
back
then
several
of
the
nomads
raised
their
arms
and
hurled
dark
small
objects
toward
the
barrier
sykes
recognized
them
even
while
they
were
in
the
air
grenades
he
shouted
to
his
men
and
they
flattened
behind
the
barricade
six
explosions
thundered
almost
simultaneously
mud
and
rocks
sprayed
into
the
air
and
fell
back
in
a
furious
rain
upon
the
defenders
cautiously
sykes
lifted
himself
from
the
ground
and
got
a
glimpse
of
the
scene
once
more
a
hundred
feet
of
fence
had
disappeared
in
a
tangle
of
shattered
posts
and
hanging
coils
through
the
opening
the
nomads
poured
over
the
barricades
in
the
midst
of
sykes
men
smashing
hoofs
landed
almost
upon
him
but
for
his
frantic
rolling
and
twisting
out
of
their
path
gunfire
was
a
continuous
blasting
wave
sykes
thought
he
heard
above
it
the
sound
of
johnson
voice
roaring
commands
to
the
retreating
men
it
sounded
like
he
was
saying
close
up
close
up
but
sykes
never
knew
for
sure
an
enormous
explosion
seemed
to
come
from
nowhere
and
thunder
directly
in
front
of
him
the
day
darkened
suddenly
and
he
felt
himself
losing
all
control
of
his
own
being
he
wondered
if
a
cloud
had
crossed
the
sun
but
almost
at
the
same
time
he
ceased
to
be
concerned
about
the
question
at
all
the
first
of
the
wounded
came
in
slowly
borne
by
stretcher
bearers
on
foot
who
had
literally
dragged
their
charges
through
the
lines
of
invading
horsemen
ken
directed
their
assignment
to
the
he
had
always
believed
he
could
take
a
scene
like
this
in
his
stride
but
now
he
felt
he
must
keep
moving
constantly
to
keep
from
becoming
violently
sick
overhead
a
pall
of
smoke
surged
again
blotting
out
partly
the
comet
light
more
houses
had
been
fired
by
the
invaders
the
sound
of
crackling
flames
mingled
with
the
thunder
of
hoofs
and
the
roll
of
rifle
fire
surely
it
would
be
possible
ken
thought
for
such
a
charge
to
succeed
unless
it
were
backed
by
strong
infantry
he
moved
into
one
of
the
houses
and
directed
the
placement
of
the
severely
wounded
man
brought
up
now
by
the
bearers
as
they
left
he
looked
down
at
the
stained
and
bloody
face
a
nurse
was
already
at
work
cutting
away
the
matted
clothing
from
the
wound
ken
exclaimed
loudly
before
he
realized
what
he
was
saying
harris
harris
you
should
have
been
out
there
the
man
opened
his
eyes
slowly
against
the
terrible
pain
he
smiled
in
recognition
it
was
harris
the
principal
of
mayfield
high
school
the
one
ken
had
attended
he
was
an
old
man
at
least
fifty
much
too
old
to
have
been
at
the
barricade
with
a
rifle
you
should
have
been
out
there
ken
repeated
harris
seemed
to
have
difficulty
in
seeing
him
ken
he
said
slowly
it
ken
maddox
is
it
everybody
has
to
do
something
it
seemed
like
this
was
the
best
thing
i
could
do
no
school
to
teach
no
school
for
a
long
time
his
voice
wavered
as
he
began
to
ramble
i
guess
that
makes
all
the
students
happy
no
school
all
winter
long
i
always
dreamed
of
mayfield
being
a
school
where
they
would
be
glad
to
come
whose
opening
in
the
fall
would
be
welcomed
and
closing
in
the
spring
would
be
regretted
i
never
got
that
far
i
guess
i
did
do
a
really
bad
job
did
i
ken
mayfield
is
a
pretty
good
school
is
it
mayfield
is
a
swell
school
harris
said
ken
it
be
the
best
day
ever
when
mayfield
opens
up
again
yes
when
school
opens
again
harris
said
and
then
he
was
still
the
nurse
felt
his
pulse
and
regretfully
drew
the
sheet
up
to
cover
his
face
i
sorry
she
said
to
ken
blindly
he
turned
and
went
out
to
the
porch
harris
he
thought
the
little
man
they
laughed
at
so
often
with
schoolboy
cruelty
he
had
wanted
to
make
mayfield
a
good
school
so
students
would
be
glad
to
attend
he
done
that
almost
mayfield
a
good
school
ken
looked
at
the
rolling
clouds
of
black
smoke
in
the
sky
the
gunfire
seemed
less
steady
now
suddenly
he
was
running
furiously
and
with
all
his
strength
he
turned
down
main
street
and
headed
south
he
ran
until
he
caught
sight
of
the
first
nomad
he
had
seen
since
the
events
in
the
mayor
council
chamber
the
enemy
had
stopped
his
horse
rearing
high
while
he
hurled
some
kind
of
incendiary
through
the
window
of
a
house
it
exploded
inside
and
billows
of
flame
and
smoke
poured
out
a
pain
gripped
ken
he
looked
wildly
about
and
saw
a
fragment
of
brick
lying
beside
a
demolished
house
nearby
he
snatched
up
the
missile
and
wound
up
as
if
pitching
one
straight
over
the
corner
of
the
plate
the
horseman
saw
the
motion
of
his
arm
and
tried
to
whirl
but
he
was
too
late
the
brickbat
caught
him
at
the
side
of
the
head
and
he
dropped
to
the
snow
without
a
sound
ken
ran
forward
and
caught
up
the
nomad
rifle
and
ammunition
belt
the
horse
had
fled
in
panic
without
a
backward
glance
ken
raced
on
down
the
street
toward
the
dwindling
sound
of
battle
the
invaders
were
retreating
streaming
from
all
directions
toward
the
break
in
the
barrier
firing
steadily
as
they
came
the
defenders
were
trying
to
block
the
escape
ken
dropped
behind
a
barricade
next
to
an
older
man
he
did
know
he
searched
for
an
opening
and
waited
for
a
rider
to
cross
his
sights
then
he
squeezed
the
trigger
and
the
man
fell
when
he
looked
up
again
the
last
of
the
invaders
were
gone
only
half
of
those
who
had
come
up
to
the
attack
were
leaving
it
the
men
around
ken
slowly
relaxed
their
terrible
tension
from
some
lying
prone
there
were
cries
of
pain
those
who
could
stand
did
so
and
revealed
their
drawn
faces
to
one
another
teams
of
the
medical
group
began
moving
again
a
wagon
was
brought
up
that
had
been
fitted
with
boards
across
the
sides
so
that
two
layers
of
wounded
men
could
be
carried
at
once
ken
heard
sudden
hoofbeats
behind
and
turned
sheriff
johnson
rode
up
and
surveyed
the
scene
his
eye
caught
ken
figure
standing
in
the
midst
of
it
rifle
in
hand
the
captured
ammunition
belt
draped
over
his
shoulder
you
white
anger
was
on
johnson
face
you
were
ordered
to
stay
out
of
the
frontline
he
thundered
any
other
man
would
be
for
such
disobedience
get
back
where
you
belong
and
do
show
your
face
in
this
area
again
i
jail
you
for
the
rest
of
the
fighting
if
you
disobey
again
but
half
only
for
his
impulsive
action
ken
turned
and
moved
down
the
street
leave
that
gun
here
the
sheriff
commanded
harshly
ken
gave
it
to
the
nearest
soldier
he
took
off
the
ammunition
belt
and
handed
it
over
too
then
resumed
his
course
he
should
not
have
done
it
he
told
himself
but
he
felt
better
for
it
he
felt
he
had
paid
a
little
of
his
debt
to
harris
when
he
reached
the
hospital
center
he
told
his
father
it
was
a
good
thing
said
professor
maddox
gently
but
maybe
it
was
something
that
had
to
be
done
throughout
the
day
they
continued
to
bring
in
the
wounded
and
the
dead
there
seemed
to
be
an
incredible
number
but
the
invaders
had
suffered
heavily
too
half
their
force
had
been
lost
a
dozen
fine
horses
had
been
captured
which
were
a
considerable
prize
there
was
speculation
as
to
why
the
nomads
chose
to
attack
in
this
manner
they
had
done
great
damage
it
was
true
yet
the
attack
had
not
had
a
chance
of
being
decisive
in
spite
of
their
insane
persistence
hilliard
and
johnson
held
a
staff
meeting
that
afternoon
while
a
sharp
watch
was
kept
for
further
attack
they
considered
that
they
had
done
very
well
so
far
the
chief
worries
were
the
grenades
and
incendiaries
which
the
nomads
seemed
to
have
in
large
quantity
toward
evening
johnson
asked
for
two
volunteers
to
go
out
as
scouts
to
try
to
reach
the
top
of
lincoln
peak
west
of
town
to
spot
the
camp
of
the
nomads
and
scout
their
activities
a
pair
of
volunteers
was
chosen
from
the
many
who
offered
on
two
of
the
best
of
the
horses
they
made
their
way
across
the
frozen
plain
and
up
the
small
ravine
leading
to
the
ridge
observers
watched
until
they
were
out
of
sight
in
the
ravine
it
was
agreed
the
two
would
return
by
at
there
was
the
faint
sound
of
gunfire
from
somewhere
in
the
hills
the
scouts
did
not
return
at
the
appointed
time
they
did
not
return
at
all
night
came
and
word
spread
among
the
townspeople
of
the
disappearance
of
the
two
scouts
anxiety
increased
as
it
became
apparent
they
were
under
close
surveillance
by
the
enemy
perhaps
it
was
the
intention
of
the
nomads
to
wear
them
down
with
a
siege
of
attack
after
attack
until
they
no
longer
had
the
ability
or
strength
to
fight
hilliard
and
johnson
doubted
this
the
nomads
were
far
less
equipped
for
such
a
siege
than
mayfield
was
maria
continued
to
return
to
the
radio
shack
in
the
evening
to
maintain
the
schedule
with
the
network
she
reported
the
plight
of
mayfield
to
the
other
stations
from
across
the
country
came
the
fervent
best
wishes
of
those
who
heard
her
wishes
were
all
they
could
offer
the
scientists
were
particularly
anguished
because
they
considered
the
group
among
the
most
likely
to
crack
the
barrier
that
kept
them
from
conquest
of
the
comet
dust
our
prayers
are
with
you
the
pasadena
group
said
they
sent
a
new
report
and
maria
typed
it
and
showed
it
to
professor
maddox
that
evening
he
scanned
it
and
put
the
pages
in
his
coat
pocket
as
he
glanced
out
the
window
toward
college
hill
it
seems
like
ages
he
said
i
wonder
if
we
ever
get
back
up
there
the
next
attack
came
well
before
dawn
sheriff
johnson
was
among
the
first
to
be
aware
of
it
the
thunder
of
seemingly
countless
hoofs
was
heard
faintly
out
of
the
south
and
he
put
his
glasses
to
his
eyes
the
nomads
were
a
black
patch
against
the
snow
how
many
horses
have
they
got
he
exclaimed
to
the
patrolman
beside
him
this
was
ernest
parkin
one
of
his
best
officers
i
say
there
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
of
them
said
parkin
in
awe
they
must
have
been
gathering
horses
for
weeks
feed
said
johnson
for
themselves
and
the
animals
they
may
be
rabble
and
savages
but
they
had
genius
of
leadership
behind
shelter
they
waited
for
the
blow
all
orders
had
already
been
given
only
the
general
alarm
was
sounded
now
it
had
been
expected
that
the
previous
pattern
of
attack
would
be
repeated
the
defenders
had
been
moved
back
from
the
barbed
wire
they
fired
slowly
and
methodically
with
a
splendidly
efficient
barrage
as
the
nomads
swung
out
of
the
night
to
blast
with
their
grenades
at
the
reconstructed
fence
the
way
opened
and
they
plunged
in
the
defenders
closing
behind
and
retreating
to
the
other
side
of
their
barricades
ken
paced
restlessly
as
he
heard
the
shooting
i
going
up
on
the
roof
he
told
his
father
there
ca
be
any
objection
to
that
i
guess
not
i
call
you
when
we
need
you
ken
climbed
the
stairs
of
the
building
which
was
the
highest
in
mayfield
he
came
out
on
the
frozen
surface
of
the
roof
and
looked
into
the
distance
the
mounted
invaders
were
circling
like
indians
about
several
blocks
of
houses
firing
steadily
at
the
defenders
and
hurling
incendiaries
at
the
houses
then
as
ken
turned
his
eyes
to
the
northern
end
of
the
valley
he
felt
as
if
the
whole
world
had
suddenly
fallen
to
pieces
in
the
dim
morning
light
on
foot
a
vast
host
of
the
invaders
moved
toward
the
northern
defenses
of
the
town
instantly
he
understood
their
strategy
while
their
small
parties
of
mounted
attackers
had
pressed
the
southern
defenses
giving
the
impression
they
intended
to
make
their
major
approach
there
the
bulk
of
their
forces
had
marched
entirely
around
lincoln
peak
and
come
upon
the
northern
boundary
at
night
that
was
why
the
peak
had
been
so
heavily
guarded
against
the
scouts
it
had
been
a
march
of
over
miles
to
the
valley
now
however
the
nomads
were
in
a
position
to
achieve
their
goal
the
bulk
of
the
town
defense
was
concentrated
in
the
south
little
stood
in
the
way
of
the
horde
advancing
from
the
north
his
heart
sickened
as
he
saw
them
rip
through
the
enclosure
the
poorly
manned
defense
posts
seemed
almost
only
a
scattering
of
shots
was
thrown
at
the
invaders
from
somewhere
a
warning
siren
sounded
the
signal
to
indicate
invasion
in
that
sector
it
was
far
too
late
for
that
ken
thought
the
horde
was
already
in
the
streets
fanning
out
dispersing
in
the
deserted
streets
ken
started
for
the
doorway
leading
from
the
roof
his
responsibility
to
college
hill
was
gone
now
every
man
in
the
valley
was
fighting
for
his
own
life
if
that
battle
were
lost
college
hill
would
be
only
an
empty
symbol
where
ghosts
were
housed
as
in
berkeley
as
in
chicago
as
in
a
thousand
centers
of
learning
the
world
around
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
he
paused
at
a
new
sound
that
broke
upon
the
air
an
incredible
barrage
of
firing
was
occurring
along
northern
main
street
near
avenue
he
put
the
fieldglasses
to
his
eyes
again
and
watched
the
scattering
nomads
seeking
cover
dozens
of
them
lay
where
they
fell
headlong
in
the
streets
ken
strained
his
eyes
to
see
where
the
defense
had
come
from
it
was
centered
in
the
houses
and
buildings
that
lined
the
streets
and
on
their
rooftops
he
could
see
the
outlines
of
figures
on
those
roofs
for
a
moment
he
failed
to
understand
then
he
felt
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
in
a
desperate
gamble
johnson
and
hilliard
had
anticipated
this
move
and
prepared
for
it
as
best
they
could
they
had
allowed
the
main
body
of
the
attackers
to
enter
the
town
itself
and
had
deployed
the
majority
of
their
guns
to
ring
them
about
while
offering
only
token
defense
on
the
south
this
was
it
the
battle
would
be
fought
here
and
now
in
the
streets
of
mayfield
and
before
the
day
was
over
it
would
be
known
whether
the
city
would
continue
its
struggle
to
live
or
whether
it
would
become
another
berkeley
chapter
the
spearhead
of
the
nomad
infantry
attack
broke
through
between
two
lightly
manned
guard
posts
whose
garrisons
fled
in
retreat
with
a
few
ineffective
shots
the
column
came
through
in
a
widening
wedge
as
it
met
more
defenders
it
fell
back
but
it
appeared
to
the
nomads
that
the
whole
defense
line
had
crumbled
or
had
been
diverted
to
the
south
as
anticipated
they
poured
along
main
street
in
the
faint
dawnlight
until
they
reached
avenue
there
they
split
and
fanned
along
east
and
west
it
was
their
strategy
obviously
to
occupy
and
seal
off
this
large
northern
sector
of
the
town
which
amounted
to
of
its
total
area
and
cut
across
a
large
portion
of
the
business
section
they
would
solidify
their
position
here
destroy
all
opposition
then
move
to
still
another
sector
until
they
were
in
command
of
the
entire
town
it
was
a
strategy
that
would
work
unless
everything
mayfield
possessed
were
thrown
against
it
ken
thought
he
saw
now
why
avenue
had
been
chosen
as
the
line
of
attack
the
defenders
were
intrenched
there
and
were
offering
forceful
opposition
he
looked
for
a
moment
to
the
south
again
the
defenses
there
were
light
yet
the
charge
of
the
mounted
nomads
had
to
be
contained
or
they
would
drive
all
the
way
to
the
center
of
town
burning
and
killing
as
they
went
if
they
succeeded
in
joining
with
the
infantry
they
would
have
split
mayfield
defenses
in
two
johnson
had
mounted
his
best
men
using
the
captured
nomad
horses
as
well
as
the
town
own
desperately
this
small
force
was
trying
to
contain
and
exterminate
the
enemy
picked
sharpshooters
had
been
carefully
stationed
with
the
best
rifles
available
although
the
gunfire
was
not
heavy
ken
could
see
johnson
men
were
taking
a
heavy
toll
of
the
invader
in
the
north
the
lines
of
fixed
battle
had
now
been
established
the
nomads
had
drawn
back
to
positions
of
cover
in
the
empty
houses
facing
their
flanks
were
more
mobile
fighting
for
advantage
along
streets
parallel
to
main
but
some
blocks
away
on
either
side
and
extending
all
the
way
back
to
the
point
of
breakthrough
while
he
surveyed
the
scene
from
the
roof
ken
watched
the
stealthy
movement
of
defenders
moving
behind
the
main
line
to
try
to
surround
the
enemy
that
was
the
strategy
of
the
defense
and
the
gamble
on
which
their
entire
fate
hung
if
they
succeeded
they
would
have
the
breach
closed
leaving
no
retreat
for
the
surrounded
invader
the
comet
slowly
appeared
illuminating
the
scene
of
battle
as
if
it
lay
upon
some
other
planet
the
day
was
clear
so
far
but
a
band
of
stratus
hung
low
over
the
western
hills
it
would
probably
be
snowing
by
nightfall
ken
thought
through
the
glasses
he
recognized
the
leader
of
a
small
patrol
that
was
moving
east
on
avenue
it
was
tom
wiley
the
barber
his
men
were
mostly
students
from
the
college
they
were
trying
to
gain
a
house
farther
up
the
block
to
provide
a
covering
point
from
which
a
general
advance
of
the
line
on
both
sides
of
them
could
hinge
tom
could
not
see
that
an
opposing
patrol
had
him
under
observation
he
led
his
men
into
the
open
to
cross
the
street
ken
wanted
to
shout
for
him
to
go
back
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
heard
at
such
distance
the
enemy
patrol
moved
out
slightly
they
centered
tom
and
his
men
in
a
murderous
burst
of
rifle
fire
the
barber
fell
two
of
the
others
were
hit
but
they
managed
to
reach
cover
with
the
rest
of
their
companions
the
body
of
tom
wiley
lay
motionless
where
it
fell
in
the
street
ken
could
see
the
sign
just
a
block
away
that
read
barber
and
beauty
shop
from
where
ken
stood
the
sign
which
jutted
out
over
the
sidewalk
seemed
to
project
just
above
the
body
of
the
fallen
barber
ken
hesitated
in
his
resolve
to
go
down
there
in
the
midst
of
the
fighting
he
thought
of
johnson
words
and
hilliard
orders
would
the
defense
strategy
succeed
the
nomads
were
trained
and
toughened
by
their
weeks
of
fight
for
survival
but
mayfield
men
were
only
weakened
by
their
strained
effort
to
keep
the
town
alive
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
encirclement
a
burst
of
smoke
with
a
core
of
orange
flame
at
its
center
spurted
upward
from
a
house
this
was
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
and
a
fourth
defending
fighters
ran
from
the
rear
of
the
burning
houses
to
the
row
beyond
behind
the
screen
of
billowing
smoke
the
nomads
crept
forward
to
repeat
their
tactics
and
fire
the
houses
where
the
defenders
now
had
cover
it
was
obvious
they
recognized
the
danger
of
encirclement
by
forces
stronger
than
any
they
had
anticipated
they
were
making
a
desperate
effort
to
straighten
their
lines
parallel
to
the
barbed
wire
with
their
flanks
and
rear
clear
of
threat
ken
watched
the
success
of
their
second
incendiary
thrust
they
could
go
on
indefinitely
unless
the
defenders
succeeded
in
flanking
them
that
was
being
attempted
now
the
defenders
moved
under
the
cover
of
the
smokescreen
to
fire
on
the
advancing
nomads
the
latter
recognized
their
danger
and
held
to
solid
cover
of
houses
adjacent
to
those
they
had
fired
north
of
this
bulge
however
another
column
was
forming
and
ken
saw
in
sudden
horror
that
it
was
headed
directly
toward
the
warehouse
a
house
only
a
from
the
warehouse
burst
into
flame
there
was
a
flurry
of
activity
from
the
defenders
as
they
too
recognized
the
fresh
danger
and
brought
up
reinforcements
before
the
threatened
warehouse
this
added
resistance
seemed
to
inflame
the
determination
of
the
nomads
they
answered
the
increased
fire
sharply
another
incendiary
ignited
a
wooden
building
a
step
nearer
the
warehouse
the
defenders
tried
to
flank
the
threatening
column
but
the
latter
ran
between
a
row
of
burning
houses
along
an
alleyway
firing
additional
incendiaries
as
they
went
then
sudden
flame
burst
against
the
wooden
walls
of
the
old
skating
rink
and
licked
with
red
fury
along
its
painted
surface
in
moments
the
warehouse
was
bathed
on
all
sides
in
seething
flame
and
the
nomad
column
spread
beyond
it
unaware
of
the
mortal
damage
they
had
done
ken
turned
away
he
walked
slowly
and
decisively
down
the
stairs
he
told
his
father
what
had
just
happened
i
going
out
there
dad
he
said
they
going
to
wipe
us
out
or
destroy
every
chance
we
have
to
survive
even
if
we
drive
them
off
half
of
our
food
supply
is
gone
now
what
chance
have
we
got
even
if
we
kill
every
nomad
in
the
valley
ken
father
turned
to
a
closet
and
drew
out
a
from
a
hook
he
took
down
a
hunter
jacket
its
pockets
were
loaded
with
shells
and
he
had
an
extra
box
he
gave
to
ken
johnson
left
this
here
he
said
he
intended
it
for
our
use
if
the
nomads
reached
this
far
i
think
maybe
it
had
better
be
used
before
the
medical
center
needs
defending
ken
eyes
lighted
with
gratefulness
thanks
dad
he
said
i
glad
you
willing
i
do
know
if
i
willing
or
not
however
i
think
i
agree
with
you
that
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
ken
ran
from
the
building
clutching
the
solid
reassuring
weight
of
the
rifle
in
his
hand
his
coat
pockets
and
the
hunting
jacket
were
weighted
heavily
with
the
supply
of
ammunition
there
was
a
feeling
of
security
in
the
weapon
and
the
shells
but
he
knew
it
was
a
deceptive
security
he
went
to
eighth
street
and
turned
north
which
would
bring
him
close
to
the
burned
warehouse
he
could
see
the
immense
rolling
column
of
black
smoke
and
hear
the
bursting
crackle
of
its
flames
the
whole
town
could
go
he
thought
if
the
fire
became
hot
enough
it
would
spread
from
building
to
building
regardless
of
the
snow
cover
he
glanced
at
the
sky
and
hoped
the
snow
might
soon
resume
from
the
rooftop
it
had
seemed
to
ken
that
the
small
units
of
the
defenders
were
almost
leaderless
and
there
was
lack
of
between
them
he
came
up
in
their
rear
ranks
and
confirmed
this
suspicion
they
seemed
to
be
depending
as
best
they
could
on
unanimous
and
intuitive
agreement
about
a
course
of
action
what
had
happened
to
their
sergeants
and
lieutenants
ken
did
not
know
perhaps
in
their
haste
of
organization
there
never
had
been
any
there
was
command
of
course
as
appointed
by
sheriff
johnson
for
the
entire
sector
but
it
did
not
extend
to
the
lower
levels
in
any
degree
ken
could
see
the
men
paid
no
attention
as
ken
joined
them
he
knew
a
few
of
the
dozen
nearby
but
they
seemed
to
regard
him
as
a
total
stranger
the
shock
of
battle
was
in
their
eyes
and
they
seemed
wholly
unaware
of
anything
in
the
world
except
the
desperate
necessity
to
find
cover
and
to
destroy
the
invader
ken
followed
them
into
the
shelter
of
a
house
flanking
the
incendiaries
he
crouched
at
a
window
with
an
older
man
whom
he
did
not
know
and
leveled
his
rifle
through
an
opening
a
pair
of
figures
appeared
momentarily
at
the
edge
of
the
smoking
cloud
the
older
man
jerked
his
gun
and
fired
frantically
and
ineffectively
slow
ken
cried
aim
before
you
shoot
the
man
glanced
at
him
in
a
kind
of
daze
ken
sighted
patiently
and
carefully
the
smoke
cloud
parted
once
again
and
he
squeezed
the
trigger
one
of
the
figures
dropped
and
the
smoke
cloud
closed
down
again
ken
calmness
seemed
to
penetrate
his
companion
who
leaned
back
for
a
moment
to
wipe
a
shaking
hand
across
his
face
i
never
done
anything
like
this
before
he
murmured
helplessly
none
of
us
have
said
ken
but
we
got
to
do
it
now
watch
it
we
drawing
their
fire
bullets
shattered
the
window
casing
above
and
beside
them
across
the
room
a
man
crumpled
ken
risked
a
glance
through
the
window
we
got
to
get
out
he
exclaimed
they
going
to
rush
the
house
it
might
have
been
possible
to
hold
if
he
knew
what
cover
and
reinforcements
they
had
in
the
adjacent
houses
but
as
far
as
he
could
tell
the
small
patrol
might
be
entirely
alone
in
the
area
suddenly
it
all
seemed
utterly
hopeless
without
communication
without
leadership
how
could
they
hope
to
withstand
let
go
he
cried
the
others
seemed
willing
to
follow
him
as
they
went
through
the
back
he
saw
that
the
next
house
had
indeed
been
occupied
but
they
too
were
retreating
not
knowing
what
strength
was
near
a
new
line
of
defenders
was
moving
up
from
halfway
down
the
block
ken
held
back
to
shout
to
the
other
patrol
and
to
those
coming
let
stand
in
the
next
street
there
were
shouts
of
assent
from
down
the
line
and
they
moved
to
the
shelter
of
the
empty
houses
they
were
close
to
the
edge
of
town
near
the
barricade
and
the
nomads
would
obviously
make
their
biggest
effort
here
to
wipe
out
the
forces
that
threatened
to
close
them
off
his
own
group
ken
saw
would
also
have
to
make
their
stand
here
or
risk
being
pocketed
by
the
uncoiling
line
of
nomads
do
let
them
get
close
enough
to
fire
the
buildings
he
shouted
down
the
line
the
word
was
passed
along
with
agreement
they
broke
into
small
patrols
and
occupied
the
houses
ken
joining
one
that
took
over
the
top
floor
of
a
house
this
gave
them
the
advantage
of
good
observation
but
the
added
danger
of
difficult
escape
in
case
the
house
was
set
on
fire
its
walls
were
brick
however
and
offered
a
good
chance
of
being
held
within
minutes
the
nomads
had
occupied
the
houses
just
abandoned
ken
fired
rapidly
and
carefully
as
he
saw
them
exposed
momentarily
in
their
move
to
new
positions
his
marksmanship
had
a
telling
effect
on
the
enemy
and
encouraged
his
companions
as
soon
as
the
nomads
had
obtained
cover
however
it
was
a
stalemate
it
was
already
and
ken
wondered
how
it
had
grown
so
late
for
an
hour
or
two
they
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
twice
attempts
were
made
to
hurl
firebombs
both
were
driven
back
beyond
this
however
the
nomads
seemed
in
no
mood
to
make
further
attack
they
were
waiting
for
darkness
ken
thought
and
then
they
would
advance
with
their
firebombs
and
grenades
and
have
free
choice
of
battle
setting
if
that
happened
mayfield
might
be
a
huge
inferno
by
midnight
they
had
to
seize
the
initiative
from
the
invaders
he
called
his
companions
and
told
them
how
it
looked
they
agreed
what
can
we
do
a
tired
man
asked
we
got
to
take
the
initiative
before
they
come
at
us
again
ken
glanced
at
the
sky
within
an
hour
it
may
be
snowing
hard
that
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
hit
a
target
when
daylight
is
almost
gone
we
attack
them
instead
of
waiting
for
them
to
come
after
us
it
can
be
done
if
we
hit
hard
and
fast
enough
we
lose
some
men
but
not
as
many
as
if
we
wait
and
let
them
pick
us
off
with
their
grenades
and
incendiaries
as
they
feel
like
it
the
men
considered
it
dubiously
we
got
a
better
chance
to
hit
them
as
they
break
from
cover
someone
suggested
not
after
dark
and
that
what
they
waiting
for
they
burn
our
houses
and
drive
us
back
all
night
long
if
we
give
them
the
chance
we
must
not
give
it
to
them
reluctant
nods
of
agreement
came
from
his
group
the
way
you
put
it
i
guess
it
the
only
chance
we
got
the
former
objector
agreed
i
talk
with
the
other
groups
ken
said
he
moved
down
the
stairs
and
out
the
back
door
of
the
house
the
space
between
the
two
houses
was
entirely
open
he
flung
himself
down
and
crawled
twice
he
heard
the
whine
of
bullets
above
his
head
after
heated
argument
the
group
in
the
next
house
agreed
to
the
plan
to
rush
the
invaders
he
moved
on
down
the
block
regretting
his
own
lack
of
authority
that
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
have
to
plead
for
he
wondered
what
was
happening
in
the
rest
of
the
town
there
had
been
gunfire
all
day
but
it
seemed
incredible
there
had
been
no
communication
from
any
other
sector
or
any
evidence
of
command
no
one
he
talked
to
had
any
idea
what
had
happened
to
their
command
there
had
been
some
in
the
beginning
but
it
had
simply
seemed
to
vanish
ken
pleading
for
in
an
attack
was
the
nearest
thing
to
leadership
they
had
seen
for
hours
the
snow
was
swirling
hard
and
the
sun
was
almost
beyond
the
hills
what
little
of
it
was
visible
in
the
clouds
it
was
getting
as
dark
as
he
dared
allow
before
giving
the
signal
for
attack
but
there
was
one
more
group
to
contact
he
debated
and
decided
to
go
to
them
then
as
he
entered
the
rear
of
the
house
he
heard
the
cries
of
alarm
from
those
houses
he
had
been
to
the
invaders
were
breaking
out
for
an
incendiary
attack
he
seized
his
gun
and
fired
the
signal
for
their
own
advance
he
ran
into
the
street
shouting
for
the
others
to
follow
the
nomads
were
concentrating
their
fire
charge
at
the
other
end
of
the
row
of
houses
and
there
the
defenders
fell
back
without
an
attempt
to
advance
like
watching
a
wave
turned
back
by
a
rocky
shore
ken
saw
his
companions
fleeing
in
disorderly
retreat
through
the
rear
of
the
houses
to
the
block
beyond
a
bullet
whizzed
by
his
head
he
dropped
to
the
ground
and
crawled
on
his
stomach
to
the
safety
of
cover
behind
a
brick
house
for
a
long
time
he
lay
in
the
snow
unmoving
he
could
not
hold
back
the
sobbing
despair
that
shook
him
he
had
never
before
known
what
it
was
like
to
be
utterly
alone
mayfield
was
dying
and
taking
away
everything
that
was
his
own
personal
world
he
had
listened
to
news
of
the
destruction
of
chicago
and
of
berkeley
without
knowing
what
it
really
meant
now
he
knew
for
all
he
knew
the
nomads
might
even
now
be
in
control
of
the
major
part
of
the
town
he
could
not
know
what
had
happened
to
his
father
to
maria
to
anyone
the
crackling
of
flames
in
the
next
house
aroused
him
he
crawled
inside
the
brick
house
which
was
still
safe
for
a
moment
of
rest
he
knew
he
should
be
fleeing
with
the
others
but
he
had
to
rest
he
heard
sporadic
shooting
a
few
nomads
were
straggling
after
their
companions
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
it
was
too
far
to
shoot
however
one
nomad
stopped
and
swung
cautiously
under
the
very
windows
of
the
burning
house
next
door
ken
leveled
his
rifle
and
fired
the
bullet
caught
the
man
in
the
shoulder
and
flung
him
violently
against
the
wall
ken
saw
that
he
would
be
buried
by
the
imminent
flaming
collapse
of
that
wall
the
man
saw
it
too
he
struggled
frantically
to
move
out
of
the
way
but
he
seemed
injured
beyond
the
power
to
get
away
ken
regarded
him
in
a
kind
of
stupor
for
a
moment
the
man
out
there
was
responsible
for
all
this
he
thought
for
the
burning
and
for
the
killing
he
swung
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
went
out
brands
were
falling
upon
the
wounded
enemy
ken
hoisted
the
man
under
the
arms
and
dragged
him
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
adjacent
house
the
nomad
looked
at
ken
with
a
strange
fury
in
his
eyes
you
crazy
he
said
painfully
you
the
one
who
shot
me
ken
nodded
you
be
cut
off
well
it
wo
matter
much
anyway
by
tomorrow
your
town
will
be
burned
and
dead
soon
we
all
be
dead
ken
kneeled
on
the
ground
beside
him
as
if
before
some
strange
object
from
a
foreign
land
what
were
you
he
asked
before
i
mean
the
man
coughed
heavily
and
blood
covered
his
mouth
and
thick
growth
of
beard
the
bullet
must
be
in
his
lungs
ken
thought
he
helped
wipe
away
the
blood
and
brushed
the
man
mouth
with
a
handful
of
snow
you
crazy
the
nomad
said
again
i
guess
we
all
crazy
just
a
kid
are
you
you
want
to
know
what
i
was
a
million
years
ago
before
all
this
yes
ken
said
the
man
attempted
a
smile
gas
station
was
that
a
crazy
thing
no
need
of
gas
when
all
the
cars
quit
i
owned
one
on
the
best
little
corner
in
marysvale
why
are
you
with
them
ken
nodded
in
the
darkness
toward
the
distant
attackers
the
man
glared
twisting
with
the
pain
then
his
glance
softened
have
done
it
too
what
else
was
there
i
had
a
wife
two
kids
no
food
within
a
hundred
miles
after
we
used
what
was
in
our
own
pantry
and
robbed
what
we
could
from
the
supermarket
downtown
we
all
got
together
and
went
after
some
we
got
bigger
as
we
went
along
we
needed
men
who
were
good
with
rifles
we
found
some
we
kept
going
people
who
had
food
fought
to
keep
it
we
fought
to
take
it
that
the
way
it
had
to
be
we
heard
about
your
town
with
its
big
hoard
of
food
we
decided
to
get
it
did
you
know
you
burned
half
of
it
this
morning
no
that
tough
that
tough
all
the
way
around
do
look
at
me
that
way
kid
you
would
have
done
the
same
we
all
the
same
as
you
only
we
did
live
where
there
was
plenty
of
food
on
hand
we
were
all
decent
guys
before
me
those
guys
out
in
the
street
that
you
knocked
off
i
guess
you
decent
too
where
your
family
now
twenty
miles
down
the
valley
waiting
with
the
rest
of
the
women
and
children
for
us
to
bring
them
food
ken
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
the
man
was
bleeding
heavily
from
the
mouth
his
words
were
growing
muffled
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
get
on
with
what
has
to
be
done
said
ken
wearily
he
felt
sure
he
must
be
walking
in
a
nightmare
and
in
just
a
little
while
he
would
awaken
if
there
a
chance
i
try
to
send
somebody
after
you
never
mind
me
the
nomad
said
with
sudden
fierceness
i
done
for
you
finished
me
if
our
outfit
should
be
unlucky
enough
to
lose
see
my
wife
and
try
to
do
something
for
my
kids
get
some
food
to
them
tom
doyle
the
name
the
man
said
a
fit
of
coughing
seized
him
again
and
blood
poured
from
his
mouth
his
eyes
were
closed
when
he
lay
back
again
tom
doyle
the
name
his
bloody
lips
murmured
do
forget
that
kid
tom
doyle
service
corner
of
first
and
green
in
marysvale
we
were
all
good
guys
once
the
snow
was
so
heavy
it
seemed
like
a
solid
substance
through
which
ken
walked
in
spite
of
it
row
upon
row
of
houses
burned
with
a
fury
that
lit
the
whole
scene
with
a
glow
that
was
like
the
comet
own
above
this
the
blanket
of
black
smoke
lay
as
if
ready
to
smother
the
valley
as
soon
as
the
light
was
gone
ken
did
know
for
sure
where
he
was
going
a
kind
of
aimlessness
crept
over
him
and
there
no
longer
seemed
any
rational
objective
toward
which
to
move
he
crept
on
from
house
to
house
in
the
direction
his
group
had
gone
but
he
could
not
find
any
of
them
somewhere
he
touched
the
edge
of
combat
again
he
had
a
nightmare
of
going
into
a
thousand
houses
smashing
their
windows
out
thrusting
his
rifle
through
for
a
desperate
shot
at
some
fleeing
enemy
the
night
was
held
back
by
a
hundred
terrible
fires
he
shot
at
shadows
and
ghosts
that
moved
against
the
flames
he
sought
the
companionship
of
others
who
fought
like
himself
in
a
lonely
vastness
where
only
the
sound
of
fire
and
gunshots
prevailed
later
he
moved
through
the
streets
stricken
with
cold
that
he
could
not
lose
even
when
he
passed
and
stood
close
to
a
mass
of
burning
rubble
he
had
stopped
shooting
quite
a
long
time
ago
and
he
guessed
he
was
out
of
bullets
the
next
time
he
met
someone
he
thought
he
would
ask
them
to
look
in
his
pockets
and
see
if
any
were
left
he
kept
walking
he
passed
streets
where
the
black
charcoal
arms
of
the
skeletons
of
houses
raised
to
the
sky
he
passed
the
hot
columns
of
smoke
and
continued
to
shiver
with
cold
as
they
steamed
upward
to
the
clouds
he
passed
others
but
no
one
spoke
after
a
while
he
threw
his
gun
away
because
it
was
too
heavy
to
carry
and
he
was
too
tired
to
walk
any
more
the
falling
snow
was
covering
the
ruins
with
a
blanket
of
kind
obscurity
ken
kneeled
down
and
was
surprised
to
observe
that
he
cold
any
more
he
lay
full
length
in
the
whiteness
cradling
his
head
on
his
arms
and
peace
and
stillness
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
closed
over
him
it
seemed
an
eternity
later
that
there
was
a
voice
capable
of
rousing
him
a
familiar
voice
calling
out
in
anguish
ken
ken
this
is
your
dad
he
responded
although
it
was
like
answering
in
a
dream
take
care
of
them
dad
he
said
do
let
anything
happen
to
them
a
woman
and
two
children
tom
doyle
the
name
do
forget
that
tom
doyle
chapter
of
he
lay
between
white
sheets
and
the
stench
of
burning
things
was
everywhere
in
the
air
that
he
breathed
in
the
clean
white
covers
that
were
over
him
his
own
flesh
seemed
to
smell
of
it
he
was
not
quite
sure
if
he
were
still
in
a
world
of
dreams
or
if
this
were
real
it
was
a
golden
world
the
ground
beyond
the
window
was
gilded
with
rich
yellow
light
he
remembered
something
about
such
light
that
was
not
pleasant
he
had
forgotten
just
what
it
was
maria
larsen
stood
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
she
smiled
as
his
eyes
opened
hello
ken
she
said
i
been
waiting
so
long
i
been
afraid
you
never
wake
up
tom
doyle
he
said
did
you
find
tom
doyle
maria
frowned
i
do
know
who
you
mean
you
have
found
his
family
yet
ken
cried
struggling
to
rise
in
the
bed
go
and
find
them
right
now
i
promised
tom
doyle
i
do
it
maria
approached
and
pushed
him
gently
back
upon
the
pillow
drawing
the
covers
over
him
once
more
tell
me
about
tom
doyle
she
said
never
told
me
who
he
is
it
seemed
utterly
stupid
for
her
not
to
know
but
ken
patiently
told
her
about
doyle
service
the
best
little
station
in
the
world
at
the
corner
of
first
and
green
i
told
tom
i
take
care
of
them
he
said
now
go
and
bring
them
here
ken
maria
said
all
the
nomads
who
escaped
and
there
were
many
retreated
around
the
south
end
of
town
and
picked
up
the
women
and
children
they
left
there
they
moved
on
south
that
was
days
ago
we
no
idea
where
they
gone
ken
tried
to
rise
again
against
her
struggles
to
hold
him
down
they
could
have
gone
so
far
that
a
man
on
horseback
could
find
them
why
wo
you
help
me
i
promised
i
see
to
it
he
lay
back
weakly
covering
his
face
with
his
arm
go
and
find
tom
doyle
he
said
in
detail
he
described
where
he
had
left
the
man
you
do
believe
what
i
saying
get
tom
doyle
and
he
tell
you
it
the
truth
he
would
be
there
now
all
the
wounded
including
the
nomads
have
been
moved
to
homes
where
they
are
being
cared
for
the
dead
both
theirs
and
ours
have
been
burned
and
their
ashes
buried
do
what
i
tell
you
ken
implored
with
bewilderment
and
fear
on
her
face
maria
stood
back
from
the
bed
and
looked
at
ken
troubled
face
then
quietly
she
stole
from
the
room
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
he
had
been
overworking
himself
for
weeks
adams
was
saying
and
had
been
living
on
a
poor
diet
that
would
scarcely
keep
a
pup
going
then
you
had
a
shock
the
kind
of
shock
that
shakes
a
man
to
his
very
roots
now
you
on
your
way
up
again
ken
glanced
about
the
room
it
seemed
normal
now
and
there
was
only
a
great
emptiness
within
him
to
replace
the
frantic
urgency
he
remembered
what
you
trying
to
say
doc
is
that
i
went
off
my
rocker
for
a
while
adams
smiled
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
however
you
fine
now
ken
stared
at
the
ceiling
for
a
few
moments
will
you
still
say
so
if
i
ask
again
about
tom
doyle
what
do
you
want
to
know
was
he
found
no
maria
actually
tried
to
find
him
for
you
i
afraid
your
tom
doyle
was
among
the
dead
i
killed
him
we
killed
a
lot
of
them
and
they
killed
a
lot
of
our
people
how
did
it
end
asked
ken
i
remember
the
darkness
and
just
wandering
around
the
streets
shooting
but
i
do
know
what
i
hit
or
where
i
went
that
the
way
it
ended
said
adams
street
fighting
and
we
won
do
ask
me
how
you
were
in
a
sector
that
was
cut
off
almost
as
soon
as
you
entered
it
even
where
communication
was
maintained
things
were
nearly
as
chaotic
johnson
says
it
was
just
plain
dumb
luck
hilliard
says
he
think
it
really
happened
aylesworth
calls
it
a
miracle
a
gift
and
a
blessing
that
shows
we
meant
to
survive
most
of
the
rest
of
us
are
willing
to
look
at
it
his
way
i
could
do
something
for
tom
doyle
ken
said
finally
he
was
a
decent
guy
they
all
were
once
i
could
find
his
wife
and
children
the
doctor
shook
his
head
all
who
are
left
of
that
group
of
nomads
are
going
to
die
we
got
to
let
them
die
just
as
we
let
the
people
in
chicago
and
berkeley
and
ten
thousand
other
towns
die
we
have
no
more
power
to
save
tom
doyle
family
than
we
had
to
save
them
we
taking
care
of
the
nomad
wounded
we
could
do
as
much
for
just
one
woman
and
two
kids
we
helping
the
wounded
until
they
get
on
their
feet
adams
said
quietly
then
they
be
sent
on
to
wherever
they
came
from
ken
stared
at
him
there
is
only
one
thing
we
could
never
forgive
ourselves
for
the
doctor
continued
that
one
thing
would
be
letting
the
earth
itself
die
as
long
as
there
are
people
alive
who
can
fight
the
comet
we
still
have
a
chance
nothing
else
in
the
whole
world
matters
now
do
you
see
there
is
no
other
purpose
in
keeping
mayfield
alive
except
to
support
the
few
people
who
understand
the
dust
and
can
fight
it
beyond
that
mayfield
has
no
more
right
to
live
than
any
other
town
that
has
already
died
but
mayfield
has
to
stay
alive
to
keep
you
and
your
father
and
the
others
like
you
fighting
the
dust
adams
gave
permission
for
ken
to
be
out
of
bed
for
a
short
time
he
tried
after
the
doctor
had
left
and
almost
fell
on
his
face
the
whole
world
seemed
to
spin
in
enormous
cart
wheels
he
persisted
though
and
hours
later
he
was
making
his
way
slowly
up
college
hill
with
the
help
of
maria
who
walked
beside
him
and
lent
her
arm
for
support
at
the
top
of
the
hill
they
stopped
and
turned
for
a
look
at
the
valley
below
them
the
ruin
was
plain
to
see
in
spite
of
the
snow
cover
a
third
of
the
town
had
been
completely
burned
at
the
old
skating
rink
workmen
were
clawing
through
the
debris
for
usable
remains
of
food
a
miserably
small
pile
of
items
showed
the
extent
of
their
success
curls
of
smoke
still
rose
from
the
ashes
and
the
nauseating
smell
of
death
and
burning
floated
over
the
whole
valley
of
his
own
experience
ken
felt
only
a
numbing
confusion
as
yet
he
thought
he
should
feel
like
a
fool
for
his
collapse
at
the
height
of
the
battle
but
he
did
not
he
felt
as
if
he
had
marched
to
the
absolute
edge
of
human
endurance
and
had
looked
to
the
dark
pit
below
he
turned
to
maria
i
be
okay
now
it
time
for
you
to
get
back
to
the
radio
station
tell
them
what
has
happened
and
get
their
reports
i
see
you
tonight
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
he
had
last
been
in
the
laboratory
the
workers
were
once
more
in
the
midst
of
their
thousands
of
trials
and
failures
to
produce
a
colloidal
form
of
the
decontaminant
which
could
be
infused
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
world
to
destroy
the
comet
dust
he
stayed
until
his
father
left
at
and
they
went
home
together
he
still
had
to
depend
on
someone
else
for
assistance
on
the
steep
and
slippery
hill
when
they
reached
home
maria
had
a
lengthy
report
ready
from
the
pasadena
people
and
one
from
schenectady
professor
maddox
read
the
reports
at
the
dinner
table
he
passed
the
sheets
to
professor
larsen
as
he
finished
them
ken
saw
he
was
not
reading
with
his
usual
thorough
analysis
when
he
had
finished
he
returned
to
his
eating
with
perfunctory
motions
anything
new
ken
asked
the
same
old
story
a
thousand
hours
of
experiments
and
no
success
i
feel
we
all
on
the
wrong
track
trying
to
perfect
a
chemical
colloid
based
on
the
decontaminant
which
will
destroy
the
dust
i
feel
that
nothing
going
to
come
of
it
ken
said
i
had
a
crazy
dream
the
other
day
while
adams
had
me
under
drugs
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
i
dreamed
i
was
walking
along
the
street
and
had
a
special
kind
of
flashlight
in
my
hand
when
i
came
to
a
car
that
would
run
standing
by
the
curb
i
turned
the
beam
of
the
flashlight
on
it
then
whoever
owned
it
could
step
in
and
drive
away
after
i
had
done
that
to
all
the
cars
in
mayfield
i
turned
it
on
the
sky
and
just
kept
flashing
it
back
and
forth
and
the
comet
dust
fell
down
like
ashes
and
the
air
was
clean
professor
maddox
smiled
a
nice
dream
i
wish
we
could
make
it
come
true
i
afraid
that
idea
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
pages
of
your
science
fiction
where
it
probably
came
from
in
the
first
place
dad
i
serious
ken
said
earnestly
about
making
a
magic
flashlight
his
father
was
almost
sarcastic
which
revealed
the
extent
of
his
exhaustion
ken
thought
he
was
never
like
that
what
i
trying
to
say
is
that
there
are
other
ways
to
precipitate
colloids
we
have
even
given
any
thought
to
them
colloids
can
be
precipitated
by
heat
by
pressure
by
vibration
maybe
a
dozen
other
ways
that
i
do
know
anything
about
maybe
some
kind
of
physical
means
rather
than
chemical
is
the
answer
to
our
problem
why
do
we
let
pasadena
and
the
other
labs
go
on
with
the
chemical
approach
but
let
us
do
some
work
on
possible
physical
means
professor
maddox
sat
very
still
his
glance
passed
from
ken
to
professor
larsen
the
latter
nodded
i
think
we
have
indeed
been
foolish
in
ignoring
this
possibility
up
to
now
i
wonder
if
ken
has
got
a
very
good
thought
there
have
you
anything
specific
to
suggest
ken
father
asked
well
i
been
wondering
about
supersonic
methods
i
know
that
a
supersonic
beam
can
be
used
for
coagulation
and
precipitation
it
would
depend
on
the
size
of
the
colloidal
particles
and
on
the
frequency
of
the
wave
would
it
perhaps
we
find
a
frequency
that
would
precipitate
the
dust
but
i
wonder
if
we
would
have
the
same
problem
as
with
mechanical
treatment
of
the
earth
atmosphere
even
if
we
succeeded
on
a
laboratory
scale
how
could
it
be
applied
on
a
practical
worldwide
scale
i
do
know
said
ken
it
may
not
work
out
but
i
think
it
worth
trying
yes
i
agree
i
do
think
we
give
up
the
chemical
research
but
a
group
of
you
can
begin
work
on
this
supersonic
approach
tomorrow
the
losses
of
food
at
the
warehouse
were
enormous
less
than
percent
of
the
contents
could
be
removed
in
usable
form
most
of
the
canned
goods
had
burst
from
internal
pressure
grain
and
other
dried
products
were
burned
for
the
most
part
the
food
supply
of
the
community
was
now
reduced
to
of
what
it
had
been
the
population
had
been
reduced
by
in
men
killed
by
the
nomads
mayor
hilliard
and
his
councilmen
struggled
to
work
out
a
reasonable
ration
plan
based
upon
the
ratio
of
supplies
to
number
of
consumers
there
was
no
arithmetical
magic
by
which
they
could
stretch
the
food
supply
to
satisfy
minimum
needs
until
next
harvest
there
was
going
to
be
death
by
starvation
in
mayfield
before
spring
hilliard
fought
through
an
agreement
in
the
council
that
the
researchers
on
college
hill
and
all
their
families
were
to
have
first
priority
and
that
they
were
to
get
full
rations
at
all
times
in
order
to
keep
on
with
their
work
there
were
grumblings
among
the
councilmen
but
they
finally
agreed
to
the
wisdom
of
this
they
agreed
there
were
babies
and
small
children
who
needed
a
somewhat
normal
ration
at
least
there
were
over
four
hundred
wounded
who
had
to
be
cared
for
as
a
result
of
the
battle
there
were
also
the
aged
like
granny
wicks
and
her
companions
well
try
to
give
the
little
ones
a
chance
said
mayor
hilliard
but
the
old
ones
do
need
it
perhaps
we
can
spare
a
little
extra
for
the
wounded
who
have
a
chance
of
survival
but
not
much
we
going
to
see
that
college
hill
survives
before
spring
however
a
choice
would
still
have
to
be
made
who
was
to
have
the
remaining
share
of
food
and
who
was
not
privately
hilliard
wondered
if
any
of
them
had
a
chance
to
see
another
spring
the
decision
to
support
the
scientists
at
the
expense
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
mayfield
could
not
be
kept
secret
when
it
became
known
a
tide
of
fury
swept
the
community
the
general
public
no
longer
had
any
capacity
to
accept
the
larger
view
in
preference
to
relief
of
their
own
suffering
one
of
the
college
students
who
worked
in
the
laboratory
was
beaten
by
a
crowd
as
he
walked
through
town
he
died
the
same
evening
suddenly
the
scientists
felt
themselves
standing
apart
pariahs
among
their
own
people
they
debated
whether
to
take
the
allotment
they
asked
themselves
over
and
over
if
they
were
tempted
to
take
it
because
they
shared
the
same
animal
greed
that
gripped
the
whole
town
or
if
genuine
altruism
prodded
them
to
accept
adams
met
their
arguments
you
accept
he
said
or
everything
we
fought
for
is
worthless
you
can
stand
the
hate
of
the
townspeople
scientists
have
done
it
before
and
it
a
small
sacrifice
so
long
as
you
can
continue
your
work
those
of
us
who
are
supporting
you
believe
in
that
work
now
get
on
with
it
and
let
not
have
any
more
of
these
ridiculous
arguments
the
suggestion
of
physical
means
of
precipitating
the
dust
came
like
a
burst
of
light
to
the
entire
group
as
they
began
to
examine
the
possibilities
within
a
week
they
had
determined
there
was
indeed
a
broad
range
of
supersonic
frequencies
capable
of
precipitating
the
dust
the
night
professor
maddox
and
his
companions
came
home
to
announce
their
success
they
were
met
with
the
news
that
larsen
was
during
the
day
she
had
developed
a
high
temperature
with
severe
pains
in
her
body
professor
larsen
was
deeply
worried
she
never
been
ill
like
this
before
ken
was
sent
for
adams
but
the
latter
did
not
come
for
almost
hours
when
he
did
arrive
they
were
shocked
by
his
appearance
his
face
was
lined
and
hollow
with
exhaustion
beyond
anything
they
had
seen
as
long
as
they
had
known
him
he
looked
as
if
he
were
on
the
verge
of
illness
himself
he
brushed
away
their
personal
questions
and
examined
larsen
rather
perfunctorily
they
thought
however
there
was
no
hesitation
as
he
announced
his
diagnosis
it
the
sixteenth
case
i
seen
today
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
this
week
we
got
an
epidemic
of
flu
on
our
hands
it
no
mild
kind
either
it
as
virulent
as
any
that
ever
been
experienced
maddox
uttered
a
low
cry
of
despair
how
much
more
must
we
be
called
upon
to
endure
no
one
answered
adams
rummaged
in
his
bag
i
have
vaccine
for
all
of
you
i
do
know
how
much
good
it
will
do
against
this
brand
of
bug
that
loose
now
but
we
can
give
it
a
chance
is
everyone
in
town
getting
it
professor
maddox
asked
adams
snorted
do
you
think
we
keep
supplies
of
everything
in
emergency
proportions
college
hill
gets
it
nobody
else
we
ca
go
on
taking
from
everyone
else
like
this
protested
maddox
they
have
as
much
right
to
it
as
we
there
should
be
a
lottery
or
something
to
determine
who
gets
the
vaccine
hilliard
orders
said
adams
besides
we
settled
all
this
you
first
ken
for
a
few
days
after
the
battle
with
the
nomads
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
common
terror
had
welded
all
of
mayfield
into
an
impregnable
unit
there
was
a
sense
of
having
stood
against
all
that
man
and
nature
could
offer
and
of
having
won
out
against
it
however
the
penetrating
reality
of
impending
competition
among
themselves
for
the
necessities
of
life
for
the
very
right
to
live
had
begun
to
shatter
the
bonds
that
held
the
townspeople
as
one
the
killing
of
the
college
student
in
protest
against
the
partiality
to
college
hill
was
the
first
blast
that
ripped
their
unity
some
protested
openly
against
the
viciousness
of
it
but
most
seemed
beyond
caring
there
were
two
events
of
note
in
the
days
following
the
first
was
a
spontaneous
almost
resurgence
of
memory
of
granny
wicks
and
her
warnings
everything
she
had
said
had
come
true
the
feeling
swept
mayfield
that
here
in
their
very
midst
was
an
oracle
of
truth
who
had
been
almost
wholly
ignored
there
was
nothing
they
needed
to
know
so
much
as
the
outcome
of
events
with
respect
to
themselves
and
to
the
town
as
a
whole
almost
overnight
streams
of
visitors
began
to
pour
toward
the
home
for
the
aged
where
granny
lived
when
they
came
she
smiled
knowingly
and
contentedly
as
if
she
had
been
expecting
them
waiting
for
them
obligingly
and
with
the
peaceful
aura
of
omniscience
she
took
them
into
her
parlor
and
told
them
of
things
to
come
at
the
same
time
frank
meggs
felt
new
stirrings
within
him
he
sensed
that
he
had
been
utterly
and
completely
right
in
all
his
years
of
criticism
of
those
who
managed
the
affairs
of
mayfield
the
present
condition
of
things
proved
it
the
town
was
in
utter
chaos
its
means
of
survival
all
but
destroyed
incompetently
its
leaders
bumbled
along
not
caring
for
the
mass
of
the
people
bestowing
the
people
goods
on
the
leaders
favorites
he
began
saying
these
things
on
the
streets
he
got
a
box
and
used
it
for
a
platform
and
he
shouted
from
the
street
corners
that
the
leaders
were
corrupt
and
none
of
them
were
safe
unless
college
hill
and
city
hall
were
wiped
out
he
said
that
he
would
be
a
better
mayor
than
anyone
else
in
mayfield
he
had
listeners
they
gathered
on
the
corners
in
the
daytime
and
they
listened
at
night
by
the
light
of
flaming
torches
many
people
began
to
believe
that
he
was
right
a
week
after
larsen
illness
it
was
evident
beyond
all
doubt
that
mayfield
was
the
victim
of
a
killer
epidemic
mayor
hilliard
himself
was
stricken
and
he
sent
word
that
he
wanted
professor
maddox
ken
and
larsen
to
come
to
his
bedside
he
was
like
a
feeble
old
man
when
they
arrived
all
the
fire
and
the
life
had
gone
from
his
eyes
but
he
brightened
a
little
as
they
came
into
the
room
at
least
you
are
still
alive
he
said
gruffly
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
of
that
fact
and
i
wanted
to
have
a
final
understanding
that
soaked
into
your
thick
heads
that
nothing
is
to
interfere
with
your
own
survival
we
hope
you
not
overestimating
our
worth
said
professor
maddox
i
do
know
whether
i
am
or
not
all
i
know
is
that
if
you
not
worth
saving
then
nobody
is
so
if
this
town
is
going
to
die
you
are
going
to
be
the
last
ones
left
alive
and
if
you
do
give
me
your
word
on
this
right
now
i
come
back
and
haunt
you
every
minute
you
do
survive
in
order
to
haunt
you
have
to
be
in
the
proper
realm
said
professor
maddox
attempting
a
joke
mayor
hilliard
sighed
i
think
i
can
take
care
of
that
too
i
beat
you
close
to
it
but
you
got
to
hang
on
carry
on
with
your
work
on
the
hill
one
thing
more
this
fellow
meggs
has
got
to
be
crushed
like
a
worm
when
i
go
there
wo
be
any
election
johnson
is
taking
over
and
he
look
out
for
you
the
same
as
i
have
done
you
going
to
be
all
right
said
professor
maddox
you
be
up
on
your
feet
in
another
week
the
mayor
seemed
not
to
have
heard
him
he
was
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
there
was
an
amused
smile
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
ai
mother
nature
a
funny
old
gal
though
he
said
she
planned
this
to
work
out
just
right
and
i
think
it
another
of
old
doc
aylesworth
signs
that
mayfield
and
college
hill
are
going
to
live
so
that
the
rest
of
the
world
will
too
it
may
get
knocked
pretty
flat
but
it
going
to
get
up
again
what
are
you
talking
about
said
ken
the
invasion
of
the
nomads
and
then
this
flu
do
you
see
it
first
we
get
our
food
supply
knocked
out
and
now
old
mamma
nature
is
going
to
cut
the
population
down
to
match
it
we
tried
to
figure
out
who
was
going
to
eat
and
who
was
going
to
starve
and
now
it
going
to
be
all
figured
out
for
us
balance
of
nature
or
something
you
scientists
call
it
do
you
he
glanced
up
at
the
professors
and
ken
it
a
wonderful
thing
he
said
just
absolutely
wonderful
chapter
three
days
later
mayor
hilliard
died
it
was
on
the
same
day
that
maria
mother
was
buried
maria
had
watched
her
mother
day
and
night
losing
strength
and
finally
lapsing
into
a
coma
from
which
she
never
emerged
maria
and
her
father
did
their
best
to
control
their
grief
to
see
it
as
only
another
part
of
the
immense
reservoir
of
grief
all
about
them
when
they
were
alone
in
their
section
of
the
house
they
gave
way
to
the
loss
and
the
loneliness
they
felt
there
were
no
burial
services
the
deaths
had
mounted
to
at
least
a
score
daily
no
coffins
were
available
each
family
dug
its
own
shallow
graves
in
the
frozen
ground
of
the
cemetery
sheriff
johnson
posted
men
to
help
and
to
see
that
graves
were
at
least
deep
enough
to
cover
the
bodies
beyond
this
nothing
more
could
be
done
only
aylesworth
came
daily
to
hold
prayer
services
it
was
little
enough
to
do
but
it
was
all
there
was
left
for
him
when
the
death
of
mayor
hilliard
became
known
sheriff
johnson
called
an
immediate
session
of
the
councilmen
and
announced
himself
as
successor
visitors
were
invited
and
professor
maddox
thought
it
of
sufficient
importance
to
attend
the
tension
in
the
air
was
heavy
as
the
group
sat
in
thick
coats
in
the
unheated
hall
johnson
spoke
without
preliminaries
there
are
some
of
you
who
wo
like
this
he
said
our
town
charter
calls
for
an
emergency
election
in
case
of
the
mayor
death
and
some
of
you
think
we
should
have
one
now
so
do
those
out
there
he
waved
a
hand
toward
the
window
and
the
town
beyond
however
we
not
going
to
have
an
election
and
i
tell
you
why
i
know
the
man
who
would
win
it
and
you
do
too
frank
meggs
he
hated
hilliard
he
hates
us
and
he
hates
this
town
and
he
do
everything
in
his
power
to
destroy
it
today
he
would
win
an
election
if
it
were
held
he
used
the
discomfort
of
the
people
to
stir
them
to
a
frenzy
against
hilliard
policy
of
protection
for
college
hill
stir
them
up
against
anything
that
means
a
sacrifice
of
present
safety
for
survival
meggs
is
a
dangerous
man
maybe
this
is
the
way
it
ought
to
be
done
but
i
do
know
any
other
way
when
this
is
all
over
there
will
be
time
enough
for
elections
and
if
i
do
step
down
you
can
shoot
me
or
run
me
out
of
the
country
or
anything
else
you
like
for
the
time
being
though
this
is
the
way
things
are
going
to
be
it
what
hilliard
wanted
and
got
his
written
word
if
any
of
you
care
to
see
it
he
looked
about
challengingly
there
was
a
scuffling
of
feet
some
councilmen
looked
at
their
neighbors
and
back
again
to
the
sheriff
none
stood
up
to
speak
nor
did
any
of
the
visitors
voice
objections
although
several
of
frank
meggs
lieutenants
were
in
the
group
we
carry
on
then
sheriff
johnson
said
just
as
before
food
rations
will
remain
as
they
are
we
do
know
how
many
of
us
there
will
be
after
this
epidemic
is
over
maybe
none
of
us
will
be
here
by
spring
we
can
only
wait
and
see
although
his
assumption
of
power
was
accepted
docilely
by
the
council
it
sparked
a
furor
among
the
populace
of
mayfield
frank
meggs
fanned
it
with
all
the
strength
of
his
hatred
for
the
town
and
all
it
stood
for
granny
wicks
fortunetelling
business
continued
to
grow
considerations
had
been
given
to
the
desirability
of
putting
a
stop
to
it
but
this
would
have
meant
literally
imprisoning
her
and
it
was
reasoned
this
would
stir
up
more
fire
than
it
would
put
out
her
glory
was
supreme
as
she
sat
in
an
old
rocker
in
the
cottage
where
she
lived
lines
of
visitors
waited
all
day
at
her
door
inside
she
was
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
wore
an
ancient
shawl
on
her
head
against
the
cold
of
the
faintly
heated
room
she
cackled
in
her
voice
with
hysterical
glee
to
those
who
came
her
words
were
solemn
pronouncements
of
eternal
truth
to
anyone
else
it
would
have
been
sheer
mumbo
jumbo
but
her
believers
went
away
in
ecstasy
after
carefully
copying
her
words
they
spent
hours
at
home
trying
to
read
great
meanings
into
her
senile
nonsense
it
was
quite
a
time
before
frank
meggs
realized
the
power
that
lay
in
the
old
woman
and
he
berated
himself
for
not
recognizing
it
earlier
when
he
finally
did
go
to
see
her
he
was
not
disappointed
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
she
with
her
ancient
wrinkled
face
and
eyes
could
be
confused
with
a
source
of
prophecy
and
wisdom
in
these
times
of
death
and
terror
i
want
to
lead
this
people
granny
he
said
after
she
had
bade
him
sit
down
tell
me
what
to
do
she
snorted
and
eyed
him
sharply
what
makes
you
think
you
can
lead
this
people
she
demanded
because
i
see
they
have
been
led
into
disaster
by
selfish
ignorant
fools
said
frank
meggs
men
who
believe
that
in
the
laboratories
on
the
hill
there
can
be
found
a
way
to
dispel
the
power
of
the
great
comet
because
they
believe
this
they
have
persecuted
the
people
they
have
taken
their
food
and
have
given
it
to
the
scientists
they
have
protected
them
and
them
alone
from
the
disease
that
sickens
us
you
do
not
believe
these
men
can
overcome
the
power
of
the
comet
do
you
granny
wild
flame
leaped
in
the
old
woman
eyes
nothing
can
overwhelm
the
power
of
this
heavenly
messenger
death
shall
come
to
all
who
attempt
such
blasphemy
then
you
will
give
your
blessing
to
my
struggle
to
release
the
people
from
this
bondage
yes
granny
wicks
spoke
with
quivering
intensity
you
are
the
man
i
have
been
waiting
for
i
can
see
it
now
you
are
appointed
by
the
stars
themselves
i
prophesy
that
you
shall
succeed
and
drive
out
those
who
dare
trifle
with
the
heavens
go
with
my
blessings
frank
meggs
and
do
your
great
work
elation
filled
him
as
he
left
the
house
it
was
certain
that
granny
wicks
would
pass
the
word
of
his
appointment
to
all
who
came
to
her
audience
chamber
the
way
things
were
going
it
looked
as
if
that
would
be
of
the
people
in
mayfield
the
occupation
of
the
mayor
chair
by
sheriff
johnson
gave
frank
meggs
a
further
opening
that
he
wanted
the
crowds
grew
at
his
torchlight
harangues
even
though
of
the
population
lay
ill
with
the
flu
the
night
meetings
went
on
sheriff
johnson
has
no
right
to
the
office
he
holds
he
screamed
his
appreciative
audience
huddled
in
their
miserable
coldness
and
howled
their
agreement
this
is
not
the
way
things
should
be
done
our
charter
calls
for
an
election
but
when
will
there
be
an
election
my
friends
our
good
sheriff
is
not
the
real
villain
in
this
matter
he
is
but
the
tool
and
the
dupe
of
a
clever
and
crafty
group
who
through
him
are
the
real
holders
of
power
and
privilege
in
this
town
while
we
have
starved
they
have
been
fed
in
plenty
while
we
have
been
cold
they
have
sat
before
their
warm
fires
while
we
sicken
and
die
of
disease
they
are
immune
because
the
only
supply
of
vaccine
in
this
whole
valley
was
used
by
them
you
know
who
i
am
talking
about
the
scientists
who
would
like
to
rule
us
like
kings
from
the
top
of
college
hill
they
tell
us
the
comet
is
responsible
for
this
trouble
but
we
know
different
who
has
been
responsible
for
all
the
trouble
the
world
has
known
for
ages
science
and
scientists
the
world
was
once
a
clean
decent
place
to
live
they
have
all
but
destroyed
it
with
their
unholy
experiments
and
twistings
of
nature
they
always
admitted
their
atom
experiments
would
make
monsters
of
future
generations
of
men
but
they
did
care
about
that
now
frightened
because
they
did
know
these
experiments
would
also
destroy
the
machines
on
which
they
had
forced
us
to
be
dependent
they
try
to
say
it
is
the
comet
well
the
world
would
have
been
better
off
without
their
machines
in
the
first
place
it
would
have
been
better
off
without
them
now
got
a
chance
to
be
free
of
them
at
last
are
we
going
to
endure
their
tyranny
from
college
hill
any
longer
night
after
night
he
repeated
his
words
and
the
crowds
howled
their
approval
on
college
hill
morale
and
optimism
were
at
their
highest
peak
since
the
appearance
of
the
comet
on
the
roof
of
science
hall
there
was
being
erected
a
massive
hyperbolic
reflector
whose
metal
surface
had
been
beaten
out
of
aluminum
roofs
at
its
center
and
at
intervals
about
the
bowl
there
projected
a
series
of
supersonic
generating
units
spaced
for
proper
phasing
with
one
another
in
beaming
a
concentrated
wave
of
supersonic
energy
skyward
power
to
this
unit
was
supplied
by
a
motor
generator
set
constructed
of
decontaminated
parts
which
had
been
operating
for
a
full
week
without
sign
of
breakdown
ken
and
his
companions
had
worked
day
and
night
on
the
rough
construction
while
the
scientists
had
designed
and
built
the
critical
supersonic
generating
equipment
in
a
solid
shift
of
uninterrupted
work
they
had
mounted
and
tested
the
units
it
was
completed
on
their
second
day
of
work
tomorrow
it
would
be
turned
on
for
a
full
week
run
to
test
the
practicability
of
such
a
method
of
precipitating
the
comet
dust
laboratory
tests
had
shown
it
could
be
done
on
a
small
scale
this
projector
was
a
pilot
model
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
worthwhile
building
a
machine
with
a
reflector
feet
in
diameter
ken
father
looked
completely
exhausted
but
his
smile
was
broader
than
it
had
been
for
many
weeks
i
confident
we
will
prove
the
practicability
of
this
machine
he
said
after
that
we
will
build
a
really
big
one
and
we
tell
the
rest
of
the
world
how
to
do
it
i
do
know
how
long
it
will
take
but
this
will
do
the
job
we
get
them
to
build
big
ones
in
tokyo
and
pasadena
and
stockholm
wherever
there
civilization
enough
to
know
how
to
do
it
they
can
decontaminate
their
own
metals
and
build
new
engines
that
will
run
as
long
as
necessary
we
got
the
comet
on
the
run
he
had
meant
to
give
a
speech
but
he
could
help
it
they
were
right
and
their
staggering
labors
were
nearly
over
in
this
phase
at
least
they
slept
from
exhaustion
that
night
ken
was
awakened
in
the
hours
by
the
glare
in
his
bedroom
window
he
sat
up
and
looked
out
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
time
before
he
could
let
his
mind
admit
what
his
eyes
saw
science
hall
was
in
flames
the
entire
structure
a
mass
of
leaping
boiling
fire
ken
ran
from
his
room
crying
the
alarm
in
their
separate
rooms
his
father
and
larsen
stared
stupidly
at
the
flickering
light
as
if
also
unable
to
comprehend
the
vastness
of
the
ruin
in
frenzy
of
haste
they
donned
their
clothes
and
ran
from
their
rooms
maria
was
awake
as
was
maddox
what
is
it
they
called
then
they
too
saw
the
flames
through
the
windows
the
men
ran
from
the
house
hatless
their
tousled
hair
flying
in
the
night
halfway
up
the
hill
ken
called
to
his
father
you
got
to
stop
dad
do
run
like
that
professor
maddox
came
to
a
halt
his
breath
bursting
from
him
in
great
gasps
ken
said
there
nothing
we
can
do
dad
larsen
stopped
beside
them
nothing
except
watch
he
agreed
slowly
they
resumed
their
way
behind
they
heard
the
sounds
of
others
attracted
by
the
fire
as
they
came
at
last
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
ken
pointed
in
astonishment
there
a
crowd
of
people
over
there
near
the
burning
building
he
started
forward
a
shot
burst
in
the
night
and
a
bullet
clipped
the
tree
over
his
head
he
dropped
to
the
ground
get
down
they
firing
at
us
as
they
lay
prone
sickness
crept
through
them
simultaneously
i
know
who
it
is
ken
cried
frank
meggs
that
crazy
frank
meggs
he
got
a
mob
together
and
fired
the
college
buildings
in
agony
of
spirit
they
crawled
to
the
safety
of
the
slope
below
the
brow
of
the
hill
we
got
to
go
after
sheriff
johnson
said
ken
we
got
to
fight
again
we
got
to
fight
all
over
again
larsen
watched
the
fire
in
hypnotic
fascination
all
gone
he
whispered
everything
we
done
everything
we
built
our
records
our
notes
there
nothing
left
at
all
they
moved
down
the
hill
cautioning
others
about
the
mob
sheriff
johnson
was
already
starting
up
as
they
reached
the
bottom
quickly
they
told
him
what
they
found
at
the
top
we
should
let
the
mob
get
off
the
hill
said
ken
if
we
do
we
never
know
which
ones
took
part
there
are
as
many
down
here
who
would
like
to
be
up
there
said
johnson
you
can
be
sure
of
that
we
do
know
who
we
can
trust
any
more
get
your
science
club
boys
together
and
find
as
many
patrolmen
as
possible
ask
each
one
to
get
fifteen
men
he
thinks
he
can
trust
and
meet
here
an
hour
from
now
if
we
can
do
it
in
that
time
we
may
stand
a
chance
of
corralling
them
otherwise
we
never
have
a
chance
at
them
we
can
try
said
ken
by
now
others
had
been
fired
upon
and
driven
back
so
that
the
situation
was
apparent
to
everyone
a
great
many
townspeople
most
of
those
well
enough
to
leave
their
houses
were
streaming
toward
college
hill
it
would
be
futile
to
try
to
find
the
patrolmen
at
their
own
homes
ken
knew
they
be
coming
this
way
too
he
soon
found
joe
walton
and
al
miner
they
mingled
in
the
crowd
calling
out
for
other
members
of
the
club
within
minutes
all
but
two
had
been
found
word
was
passed
to
them
to
carry
out
the
sheriff
instructions
it
was
easier
than
they
anticipated
within
minutes
a
dozen
officers
had
been
given
the
word
to
find
their
men
at
the
end
of
the
hour
they
were
gathered
and
ready
for
the
advance
the
spectators
had
been
driven
back
the
armed
men
fanned
out
to
cover
the
entire
hill
in
a
slowly
advancing
line
they
dwindled
and
became
silhouettes
against
the
flames
at
the
top
sheriff
johnson
called
out
to
the
mob
through
an
improvised
megaphone
give
up
your
arms
and
come
forward
with
your
hands
up
he
cried
in
seconds
we
start
shooting
his
command
was
answered
by
howls
of
derision
it
was
like
the
cries
of
maniacs
and
their
drifted
words
sounded
like
kill
the
scientists
bullets
accompanied
the
shouts
and
howls
the
sheriff
men
took
cover
and
began
a
slow
and
painful
advance
there
could
be
a
thousand
mobbers
on
top
of
the
hill
ken
thought
the
sheriff
men
might
be
outnumbered
several
times
over
he
wondered
if
they
ought
to
try
to
get
reinforcements
and
decided
against
it
unless
word
should
be
sent
down
from
the
top
there
was
no
way
of
telling
how
the
battle
was
going
gunfire
was
continuous
a
freezing
wind
had
come
up
and
swept
over
the
length
of
the
valley
and
over
those
who
waited
and
those
who
fought
it
fanned
the
flames
to
volcanic
fury
ken
touched
his
father
arm
there
no
use
for
you
to
stay
in
this
cold
he
said
you
ought
to
go
back
to
the
house
i
got
to
know
how
it
comes
out
up
there
who
wins
the
cold
starlight
of
the
clear
sky
began
to
fade
as
dawn
approached
the
flames
in
the
college
buildings
had
burned
themselves
out
but
the
gunfire
continued
almost
without
letup
then
almost
as
quickly
as
it
had
started
it
died
after
a
time
figures
appeared
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
came
down
in
a
weary
procession
sheriff
johnson
led
them
he
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
was
it
meggs
ken
asked
did
you
get
frank
meggs
he
fell
in
the
first
minutes
said
johnson
it
was
really
meggs
keeping
them
going
at
all
they
had
a
witch
up
there
as
long
as
she
was
alive
nothing
would
stop
them
granny
wicks
was
she
up
there
sitting
on
a
kind
of
throne
they
made
for
her
out
of
an
old
rocking
chair
right
in
the
middle
of
the
whole
thing
did
she
finally
get
shot
sheriff
johnson
shook
his
head
she
was
a
witch
a
real
live
witch
bullets
would
touch
her
the
west
wall
of
science
hall
collapsed
and
buried
her
that
when
they
gave
up
so
maybe
you
can
say
you
won
after
all
he
said
to
professor
maddox
it
a
kind
of
symbol
anyway
do
you
think
chapter
of
the
for
the
first
time
since
the
coming
of
the
comet
ken
sensed
defeat
in
his
father
professor
maddox
seemed
to
believe
at
last
that
they
were
powerless
before
the
invader
out
of
space
he
seemed
like
a
runner
who
has
used
his
last
reserve
of
strength
to
reach
a
goal
on
which
his
eye
has
been
fixed
only
to
discover
the
true
goal
is
yet
an
immeasurable
distance
ahead
professor
maddox
had
believed
with
all
his
heart
and
mind
that
they
had
hurdled
the
last
obstacle
with
the
construction
of
the
pilot
projector
with
it
gone
and
all
their
tools
and
instruments
and
notes
there
was
simply
nothing
as
ken
considered
the
problem
it
seemed
to
him
the
situation
was
not
as
bad
as
first
appeared
the
most
important
thing
had
not
been
lost
this
was
the
knowledge
locked
in
their
own
minds
of
what
means
could
prevail
against
the
dust
beyond
this
the
truly
essential
mechanical
elements
for
starting
over
again
were
also
available
art
matthews
had
been
very
busy
and
he
had
parts
enough
for
six
more
sets
these
were
decontaminated
and
sealed
in
protective
packing
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
hours
to
assemble
one
of
them
and
that
would
power
any
supersonic
projector
they
might
choose
to
build
and
they
still
choose
to
build
one
in
the
radio
supply
stores
of
the
town
and
in
the
junk
boxes
of
the
members
of
the
science
club
there
were
surely
enough
components
to
build
several
times
over
the
necessary
number
of
generator
elements
in
the
barns
and
chicken
sheds
of
the
valley
there
was
plenty
of
aluminum
sheeting
to
build
reflectors
the
more
he
considered
it
the
more
possible
it
seemed
to
take
up
from
where
they
had
left
off
the
night
before
the
fire
there
was
one
important
question
ken
asked
himself
however
why
stop
with
a
replica
of
the
small
pilot
model
they
had
built
on
the
roof
of
science
hall
as
long
as
they
were
committed
to
building
a
projector
to
test
for
effectiveness
they
might
as
well
build
a
instrument
one
that
could
take
its
place
as
an
actual
weapon
against
the
dust
if
there
were
errors
of
design
these
could
be
changed
during
or
after
construction
he
could
see
no
reason
at
all
for
building
a
mere
instrument
again
the
greatest
loss
suffered
in
the
fire
was
that
of
the
chemistry
laboratory
and
its
supplies
and
reagents
materials
for
running
tests
on
the
dust
could
not
be
replaced
nor
could
much
of
their
microchemical
apparatus
the
electron
microscope
too
was
gone
these
losses
would
have
to
be
made
up
where
necessary
by
having
such
work
done
by
pasadena
schenectady
or
detroit
if
the
projector
were
as
successful
as
all
preliminary
work
indicated
there
would
be
little
need
for
further
testing
except
as
a
matter
of
routine
check
on
the
concentration
of
dust
in
the
atmosphere
before
approaching
his
father
ken
talked
it
over
with
his
fellow
members
of
the
science
club
he
wanted
to
be
sure
there
was
no
loophole
he
was
overlooking
labor
to
build
the
reflector
is
what
we
have
got
said
joe
walton
it
would
take
months
maybe
a
whole
year
for
us
to
set
up
only
the
framework
for
a
bowl
getting
the
lumber
alone
would
be
a
community
project
said
al
that
what
it
going
to
be
ken
answered
johnson
is
behind
us
he
give
us
anything
we
want
if
he
knows
where
to
get
it
i
think
there
any
question
of
his
authorizing
the
construction
by
the
men
here
there
was
nothing
else
they
could
think
of
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
project
it
had
been
two
days
since
the
fire
but
ken
father
still
seemed
stunned
by
it
after
dinner
he
sat
in
his
old
chair
where
he
used
to
read
but
he
did
not
read
now
he
sat
for
hours
staring
at
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
professor
larsen
seemed
locked
in
a
similar
state
of
shock
in
addition
to
his
wife
death
this
destruction
of
their
entire
scientific
facilities
seemed
a
final
blow
from
which
he
could
not
recover
ken
recognized
too
that
there
was
a
burden
these
men
had
carried
that
no
one
else
knew
that
was
the
burden
of
responsibility
for
a
major
portion
of
the
world
effort
against
the
invader
it
was
an
burden
that
men
could
not
carry
without
suffering
its
effects
ken
approached
them
that
evening
after
he
and
maria
had
helped
his
mother
with
her
chores
and
had
gathered
snow
to
melt
overnight
for
their
next
day
water
supply
dad
ken
said
i
been
wondering
when
we
could
get
started
on
the
project
again
the
fellows
in
the
club
are
all
ready
to
go
i
guess
most
everyone
else
is
too
his
father
looked
as
if
ken
had
just
uttered
something
absolutely
unintelligible
start
he
cried
start
what
how
can
we
start
anything
there
nothing
left
to
work
with
absolutely
nothing
ken
hesitated
an
ache
in
his
heart
at
the
defeat
he
saw
in
his
eyes
he
held
out
his
hands
we
got
these
he
said
he
tapped
the
side
of
his
head
and
this
professor
maddox
face
seemed
to
relax
a
trifle
he
looked
at
his
son
with
a
faint
suggestion
of
a
smile
on
his
lips
yes
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
them
carefully
then
ken
outlined
the
results
of
his
inventory
art
can
build
up
to
six
engines
if
we
need
them
we
got
plenty
of
electronic
parts
and
tubes
big
enough
to
put
or
kilowatts
of
supersonic
energy
in
a
beam
we
do
want
to
build
a
little
reflector
again
we
want
to
put
up
a
instrument
when
that
done
build
another
one
and
still
another
until
we
used
every
scrap
of
material
available
in
the
valley
by
that
time
maybe
we
have
some
cars
running
and
can
go
to
frederick
and
other
towns
for
more
parts
ken
father
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
closed
if
enthusiasm
could
do
it
we
could
look
forward
to
such
a
structure
the
day
after
tomorrow
maybe
enthusiasm
do
it
said
professor
larsen
quietly
i
believe
the
boy
is
right
we
let
ourselves
despair
too
much
because
of
the
fire
we
still
have
the
necessary
principles
in
our
heads
if
ken
is
right
we
got
the
materials
the
only
problem
is
that
you
and
i
are
a
pair
of
old
exhausted
men
without
the
necessary
enthusiasm
and
energy
perhaps
we
can
borrow
enough
of
that
from
these
boys
i
in
favor
of
undertaking
it
by
the
light
of
oil
lamps
they
planned
and
talked
until
far
past
midnight
there
were
still
no
objections
to
be
found
outside
the
labor
problem
when
they
were
through
rough
drawings
and
calculations
for
the
first
projector
were
finished
such
a
projector
could
surely
reach
well
into
the
stratosphere
said
professor
larsen
with
the
tremendous
velocities
of
the
air
masses
at
those
heights
one
projector
should
be
able
to
process
hundreds
of
tons
of
atmosphere
per
day
i
am
wondering
said
professor
maddox
if
we
should
not
make
the
reflector
parabolic
instead
of
hyperbolic
we
may
disperse
our
energy
too
widely
to
be
effective
at
high
levels
i
think
not
the
parabola
would
narrow
the
beam
to
little
more
than
its
initial
diameter
and
would
concentrate
the
energy
more
than
is
required
with
the
power
ken
speaks
of
i
believe
the
hyperbolic
form
could
carry
an
effective
wave
into
the
stratosphere
we
make
some
calculations
for
comparison
tomorrow
they
authorized
ken
to
speak
with
the
sheriff
the
following
day
i
been
wondering
when
i
see
some
of
you
people
johnson
said
bluntly
what
are
you
doing
about
the
mess
on
the
hill
my
father
thought
maybe
you
drop
in
said
ken
the
sheriff
shook
his
head
it
your
move
i
just
wondered
if
you
had
any
ideas
or
if
this
fire
had
knocked
the
props
out
from
under
you
it
did
but
now
we
ready
to
go
and
we
need
help
briefly
ken
gave
a
description
of
the
projector
they
planned
to
build
labor
is
the
problem
for
us
if
we
could
have
all
the
carpenters
in
town
and
all
who
could
be
spared
from
woodcutting
and
every
other
activity
for
or
weeks
i
think
we
could
get
it
done
you
know
how
many
men
are
left
said
johnson
between
the
war
with
the
nomads
and
the
epidemic
of
flu
of
those
we
had
when
this
started
are
dead
a
third
of
the
ones
left
are
sick
and
quite
a
few
of
those
on
their
feet
have
to
take
care
of
the
ones
that
are
i
know
said
ken
you
know
how
the
people
feel
about
you
scientists
yes
the
sheriff
stared
at
him
a
long
time
before
continuing
it
wo
be
easy
but
we
do
it
when
do
you
want
to
start
tomorrow
morning
in
jenkin
pasture
north
of
town
how
many
men
all
the
carpenters
you
can
get
and
a
hundred
others
to
rustle
materials
and
tear
down
old
buildings
i
meet
with
the
council
this
afternoon
to
go
over
work
assignments
you
have
your
men
in
the
morning
the
rest
of
the
day
ken
and
his
fellow
club
members
chose
the
exact
spot
to
erect
the
projector
and
staked
it
out
they
spotted
the
nearest
buildings
that
could
be
dismantled
for
materials
and
made
estimates
of
how
much
they
needed
the
following
morning
they
met
again
on
the
site
and
there
were
ten
men
from
town
in
addition
to
the
college
students
and
others
who
had
taken
part
in
the
research
on
college
hill
are
you
all
johnson
could
spare
ken
asked
the
group
the
nearest
man
shook
his
head
they
were
assigned
no
one
else
would
come
they
think
you
are
wasting
your
time
they
think
you
ca
do
anything
about
the
comet
a
lot
of
them
are
like
meggs
and
granny
wicks
they
think
you
should
to
do
anything
about
it
ken
felt
a
blaze
of
anger
sometimes
i
think
they
right
he
said
bitterly
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
we
just
let
the
whole
thing
go
now
do
get
me
wrong
the
man
said
we
on
your
side
we
here
are
we
i
just
telling
you
what
they
say
and
think
in
town
i
know
and
i
sorry
these
other
fellows
will
tell
you
what
we
need
done
i
going
to
ride
in
to
see
johnson
the
sheriff
was
not
in
his
office
ken
was
told
he
had
gone
over
to
the
food
warehouse
where
rations
were
being
distributed
there
was
some
rumor
of
a
disturbance
ken
remounted
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
warehouse
as
he
approached
he
saw
the
lineup
before
the
distribution
counter
was
motionless
in
front
of
the
counter
sheriff
johnson
stood
with
a
pair
of
revolvers
in
his
hands
holding
back
the
crowd
he
glanced
at
ken
and
said
do
tell
me
i
know
you
have
any
workers
out
there
today
they
here
in
line
trying
to
collect
groceries
without
working
we
not
going
to
work
so
those
scientists
on
the
hill
can
have
the
fat
of
everything
a
man
near
the
head
of
the
line
shouted
others
echoed
him
with
cries
of
hysteria
ken
felt
his
disgust
and
disappointment
vanish
before
a
wave
of
genuine
fear
these
people
had
ceased
to
be
anything
but
frightened
hungry
animals
their
capacity
for
rational
action
had
all
but
disappeared
under
the
strains
they
had
suffered
they
were
ready
to
lash
out
at
anything
that
appeared
a
suitable
target
for
their
own
hysterical
anger
and
panic
it
was
useless
to
expect
them
to
help
with
the
projector
the
crew
of
scientists
and
students
would
have
to
do
it
alone
no
matter
how
many
weeks
it
took
sheriff
johnson
however
had
no
such
thought
he
fired
a
bullet
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
brought
them
to
silence
listen
to
me
he
said
i
know
you
sick
and
hungry
and
scared
there
not
a
man
or
woman
in
this
valley
who
is
and
that
includes
me
and
the
members
of
the
council
and
those
you
tried
to
burn
off
college
hill
you
do
know
how
good
you
got
it
you
do
deserve
it
as
good
as
you
got
you
people
should
have
been
with
those
in
chicago
or
in
san
francisco
you
should
have
known
what
it
was
really
like
to
be
suddenly
cut
off
from
every
ounce
of
food
beyond
that
which
was
in
your
own
cupboards
you
should
have
known
what
it
was
like
to
fight
day
after
day
in
the
streets
of
a
burning
city
without
knowing
why
you
were
fighting
or
having
any
hope
of
victory
you
gone
through
your
battle
and
you
won
and
you
still
here
and
there
food
left
a
lot
of
us
are
still
going
to
die
before
the
epidemic
is
over
we
have
the
medical
means
to
save
us
all
but
some
of
us
will
come
out
of
it
and
every
one
has
just
as
good
a
chance
as
his
neighbor
that
not
important
it
does
make
much
difference
whether
any
one
of
us
stays
alive
now
or
dies
in
years
what
is
important
is
trying
to
keep
the
world
alive
and
that
what
these
scientists
are
doing
while
you
accuse
them
of
every
crime
in
the
book
they
are
the
only
chance
the
world
has
got
for
survival
they
ca
do
anything
about
it
a
woman
shouted
they
just
making
it
up
to
get
more
than
the
rest
of
us
the
crowd
started
to
take
up
its
cry
again
shut
up
the
sheriff
thundered
at
them
i
repeat
you
do
deserve
to
be
as
lucky
as
you
are
but
you
are
going
to
get
out
of
taking
your
part
in
pulling
things
back
together
again
help
is
needed
out
there
north
of
town
and
you
going
to
help
you
help
or
you
do
eat
a
roar
of
rage
thundered
from
the
group
one
man
stepped
forward
you
ca
pull
a
thing
like
this
johnson
we
got
guns
too
we
used
them
before
and
we
can
use
them
again
then
you
had
better
go
home
and
get
them
right
now
said
johnson
my
men
and
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
i
suppose
there
could
be
a
lot
more
of
you
than
there
are
of
us
so
you
can
probably
shoot
us
down
then
you
can
eat
all
you
want
for
a
month
and
die
go
get
your
gun
hank
and
come
after
your
rations
the
man
turned
to
the
crowd
okay
you
heard
what
he
said
let
go
and
get
he
strode
away
then
turned
back
to
beckon
his
followers
in
the
empty
street
before
the
converted
theater
he
stood
alone
come
on
he
cried
who
coming
with
me
the
crowd
avoided
his
eyes
they
shifted
uneasily
and
looked
at
johnson
again
what
do
you
mean
another
man
asked
about
we
work
or
we
do
eat
come
on
you
guys
hank
shouted
the
assignments
on
the
projector
will
be
rotated
said
johnson
spare
as
many
men
as
we
can
from
everything
else
those
of
you
who
have
been
given
assignment
slips
will
get
days
rations
when
you
bring
back
the
slips
with
a
verification
that
you
did
your
job
on
the
projector
you
get
an
assignment
somewhere
else
until
it
your
turn
again
the
ones
without
verification
on
the
slips
do
get
the
next
days
rations
that
the
way
it
going
to
be
if
there
no
more
argument
we
get
on
with
the
distribution
hank
get
down
at
the
end
of
the
line
by
the
scientists
had
their
full
crew
of
sullen
and
unwilling
helpers
the
sheriff
had
sent
along
a
of
his
own
men
fully
armed
to
see
there
was
no
disturbance
but
the
objectors
seemed
to
have
had
their
say
with
a
gradual
increase
of
they
did
the
tasks
they
were
assigned
bringing
up
materials
laying
out
the
first
members
of
the
great
skeletal
structure
that
would
rise
in
the
pasture
johnson
came
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
see
how
it
was
going
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
lack
of
disturbance
it
looks
like
we
got
it
made
he
said
i
think
so
ken
agreed
all
we
have
to
do
now
is
see
how
many
more
of
these
we
can
get
built
in
other
parts
of
the
world
they
spoke
that
night
to
all
the
stations
on
the
radio
net
describing
in
detail
what
they
had
begun
what
they
were
confident
it
would
do
professor
larsen
words
were
relayed
to
his
colleagues
in
stockholm
they
estimated
they
could
begin
work
almost
immediately
on
six
projectors
others
elsewhere
in
the
country
were
quite
probable
in
his
conversation
with
pasadena
professor
maddox
warned
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
make
tests
with
the
big
projector
our
only
work
so
far
has
been
with
the
laboratory
models
but
they
were
highly
successful
that
good
enough
for
us
said
whitehead
director
of
the
pasadena
work
everything
we
done
here
has
failed
so
far
a
direct
chemical
approach
seems
out
of
the
question
we
start
with
one
but
i
think
a
dozen
projectors
at
least
are
possible
for
this
area
pasadena
also
reported
a
new
radio
contact
with
calcutta
and
promised
to
pass
the
word
on
to
them
and
to
tokyo
when
they
closed
down
the
transmitter
after
midnight
ken
totaled
the
number
of
projectors
promised
with
reasonable
certainty
of
having
the
promises
fulfilled
there
were
eighty
it
may
take
a
year
his
father
said
or
it
may
take
years
but
now
we
know
without
a
doubt
that
we
can
someday
get
our
atmosphere
back
as
it
was
before
the
comet
chapter
on
the
twentieth
of
january
the
comet
reached
its
closest
approach
to
earth
it
was
then
less
than
three
million
miles
away
in
the
realm
of
the
stars
this
was
virtually
a
collision
and
if
the
head
of
the
comet
had
been
composed
of
anything
more
than
highly
rarefied
gases
it
would
have
caused
tremendous
upheavals
and
tidal
waves
there
were
none
of
these
only
the
dust
ken
arose
at
dawn
that
day
and
went
into
the
yard
to
watch
the
rising
of
the
golden
enemy
a
little
before
the
sun
came
over
the
eastern
hills
he
doubted
whether
anyone
else
was
aware
it
was
closer
today
than
it
had
been
before
or
ever
would
be
again
he
doubted
there
would
be
much
scientific
interest
in
the
event
anywhere
in
the
world
in
the
observatory
he
opened
the
dome
and
adjusted
the
telescope
to
take
a
few
pictures
and
spectrograms
he
remembered
when
he
had
done
this
a
long
time
ago
with
high
excitement
and
curiosity
and
he
remembered
later
times
when
he
had
looked
up
with
a
bitter
hate
in
his
heart
for
the
impersonal
object
in
the
sky
now
he
felt
nothing
he
was
aware
only
of
a
kind
of
deadness
in
his
emotions
with
respect
to
the
comet
there
was
no
excitement
he
could
find
in
today
event
of
close
approach
which
was
probably
the
only
one
of
its
kind
that
would
be
recorded
in
the
history
of
mankind
he
wondered
if
he
had
lost
all
his
scientific
spirit
that
so
momentous
an
occurrence
could
inspire
him
so
little
now
yet
he
no
longer
hated
the
comet
either
it
was
not
a
thing
that
could
be
hated
any
more
than
the
wind
when
it
leveled
a
city
or
the
waters
when
they
drowned
the
land
and
the
people
on
it
these
things
were
beyond
hate
you
could
fight
them
but
you
never
had
the
privilege
of
hating
them
that
was
reserved
only
for
other
human
beings
it
was
because
of
the
great
impersonal
nature
of
their
common
enemy
he
thought
that
people
had
finally
turned
to
fighting
each
other
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
people
of
mayfield
had
turned
their
hate
upon
the
scientists
the
questions
of
food
and
privileges
were
only
superficial
excuses
after
an
hour
work
ken
left
the
observatory
the
gassy
tail
of
the
comet
was
a
full
halo
of
lighter
yellow
hue
as
seen
directly
along
its
central
axis
the
darker
yellow
of
the
core
seemed
to
ken
like
a
living
heart
the
light
spread
to
the
dust
motes
in
the
air
and
curtained
the
whole
sky
with
shimmering
haze
it
bathed
the
snow
cover
of
the
earth
and
reflected
its
golden
image
against
the
trees
and
the
walls
of
the
buildings
and
penetrated
the
windows
it
gilded
the
stark
charcoal
skeletons
of
the
ruins
it
had
created
it
spread
over
the
whole
earth
and
penetrated
every
pore
ken
had
a
momentary
illusion
that
there
was
not
a
particle
of
substance
in
the
world
not
permeated
and
illumined
by
the
comet
light
he
felt
as
if
it
were
inside
his
own
being
through
his
vitals
and
shining
in
the
corridors
of
his
brain
for
a
moment
the
old
hate
returned
he
wanted
to
shut
his
eyes
against
that
omnipresent
light
and
to
run
with
all
his
strength
to
some
secret
place
where
it
could
never
penetrate
he
recalled
the
words
of
larsen
that
seemed
to
have
been
uttered
so
long
ago
that
they
were
scarcely
within
memory
the
universe
is
a
terrible
place
that
barely
tolerates
living
organisms
it
is
a
great
miracle
that
here
in
this
corner
of
the
universe
living
things
have
found
a
foothold
it
does
not
pay
ever
to
forget
the
fierceness
of
the
home
in
which
we
live
there
was
no
closing
the
eyes
against
this
he
looked
again
at
the
comet
the
representative
to
earthmen
of
all
the
fierceness
and
terror
that
lay
in
outer
space
beyond
the
thin
tissue
of
atmosphere
that
protected
man
and
his
fragile
life
he
would
remember
all
the
days
of
his
life
that
the
universe
might
be
beautiful
and
exciting
and
terrible
but
whatever
it
was
it
held
no
friendliness
toward
man
it
could
destroy
him
with
a
mere
whim
of
chance
occurrence
man
had
gained
a
foothold
but
there
was
a
long
way
to
go
to
an
enduring
security
on
the
day
of
the
official
beginning
of
operation
of
the
giant
projector
in
jenkin
pasture
there
was
a
little
ceremony
sheriff
johnson
stood
on
an
improvised
platform
and
with
an
impressive
gesture
threw
the
switch
that
officially
turned
the
power
into
the
great
instrument
it
had
been
successfully
tested
previously
but
now
it
was
launched
in
an
operation
that
would
not
cease
until
the
last
trace
of
comet
dust
had
fallen
from
the
sky
and
was
mingled
with
the
dust
of
the
earth
most
of
the
townspeople
who
were
well
enough
to
do
so
turned
out
for
the
ceremony
during
the
construction
a
guard
had
been
kept
to
prevent
sabotage
of
the
projector
but
there
had
been
no
attempts
made
on
it
now
the
people
stood
in
the
trampled
snow
and
ice
of
the
pasture
staring
up
at
the
giant
structure
with
a
quality
of
in
their
eyes
and
in
the
expressions
of
their
faces
the
sheriff
made
a
little
speech
after
throwing
the
switch
he
thanked
them
for
their
and
thousands
of
of
labor
not
mentioning
that
it
had
been
obtained
initially
at
the
point
of
his
guns
he
praised
the
scientists
and
noted
that
conquest
of
the
comet
might
never
have
been
achieved
without
the
genius
of
their
men
of
college
hill
he
did
not
mention
the
attempts
to
destroy
that
genius
i
think
we
should
all
like
to
hear
he
said
from
the
man
who
has
led
this
vast
and
noble
effort
from
its
inception
he
will
speak
for
all
those
who
have
worked
so
steadfastly
to
bring
this
effort
to
a
successful
conclusion
professor
maddox
there
was
a
flurry
of
applause
then
it
grew
and
a
shout
went
up
they
called
his
name
and
cheered
as
he
stood
a
figure
dwarfed
against
the
background
of
the
great
projector
bowl
ken
knew
what
he
must
be
thinking
as
he
waited
for
the
cheers
to
subside
he
must
be
thinking
they
have
forgotten
already
forgotten
the
angers
and
the
jealousies
and
the
fears
their
attempts
to
destroy
the
small
kernel
of
scientific
hope
in
their
midst
they
had
forgotten
everything
but
the
warming
belief
that
perhaps
the
worst
of
the
terror
was
over
and
they
had
lived
through
it
i
grateful
professor
maddox
was
saying
for
the
assistance
you
have
given
this
project
although
you
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
what
it
was
meant
to
do
we
asked
for
your
faith
and
we
asked
for
your
confidence
that
we
knew
what
we
were
about
at
a
time
when
we
did
not
know
it
even
for
ourselves
we
were
nourished
and
cared
for
at
your
expense
in
order
that
our
work
might
go
on
it
would
not
have
succeeded
without
you
ken
realized
his
father
was
not
speaking
ironically
but
meant
just
what
he
said
and
it
was
true
the
vengeful
meggs
and
the
psychotic
granny
wicks
had
fought
them
and
incited
others
who
were
frightened
beyond
reason
yet
there
had
been
hilliard
and
johnson
the
council
and
many
others
who
had
supported
them
there
were
those
who
had
built
the
projector
even
though
at
the
point
of
a
gun
and
at
the
threat
of
starvation
all
of
them
together
had
made
the
project
possible
it
was
a
miniature
of
the
rise
of
the
whole
human
race
ken
supposed
more
like
a
single
individual
with
a
multitude
of
psychoses
hopes
and
geniuses
than
a
group
of
separate
entities
they
had
come
to
this
point
in
the
same
way
they
would
go
on
trying
to
destroy
the
weaknesses
and
multiply
their
strength
by
the
middle
of
february
the
flu
epidemic
was
over
its
toll
had
leveled
the
population
to
a
reasonable
balance
with
the
food
supply
whether
mayor
hilliard
ironic
suggestion
reflected
any
real
principle
or
not
the
situation
had
worked
out
in
accord
with
his
macabre
prediction
ken
had
explained
the
comet
daily
infinitesimal
retreat
and
there
was
a
kind
of
steady
excitement
in
estimating
how
much
it
diminished
each
day
actually
a
week
decrease
was
too
small
for
the
naked
eye
to
detect
but
this
did
not
matter
radio
reports
continued
to
tell
of
increased
construction
of
projectors
throughout
the
world
tests
were
showing
they
were
effective
beyond
all
previous
hopes
the
populace
of
mayfield
was
enthusiastic
about
the
construction
of
additional
units
two
more
had
been
built
and
three
others
were
planned
serious
attention
had
to
be
given
now
to
the
coming
planting
season
every
square
foot
of
available
ground
would
have
to
be
cultivated
to
try
to
build
up
stores
for
all
possible
emergencies
of
the
following
winter
when
the
time
came
for
making
the
first
work
assignments
on
the
farms
professor
maddox
and
professor
larsen
appeared
to
receive
theirs
sheriff
johnson
was
in
the
office
at
the
time
what
are
you
two
doing
here
you
can
get
back
to
your
regular
business
he
stormed
we
that
hard
up
for
farmers
we
have
no
regular
business
said
professor
maddox
the
projector
work
is
being
taken
care
of
mayfield
will
probably
not
be
the
site
of
a
university
again
during
our
lifetimes
we
want
to
be
assigned
some
acres
to
plow
by
the
way
did
you
hear
art
matthews
has
got
three
more
tractors
in
operation
this
week
if
we
can
find
enough
gasoline
we
may
be
able
to
do
the
whole
season
plowing
by
machine
you
sure
you
want
to
do
this
said
sheriff
johnson
quite
sure
just
put
our
names
down
as
plain
dirt
farmers
ken
clung
to
the
radio
for
reports
of
the
outside
world
the
batteries
were
all
but
exhausted
but
a
motor
generator
could
be
allotted
to
the
station
as
soon
as
other
work
was
out
of
the
way
in
pasadena
they
told
him
a
diesel
railway
engine
had
been
successfully
decontaminated
and
put
into
operation
airtight
packing
boxes
had
been
designed
for
the
wheels
to
keep
them
from
being
freshly
affected
by
the
dust
remaining
in
the
air
it
was
planned
to
operate
a
train
from
the
metropolitan
area
to
the
great
farming
sections
to
the
east
and
north
a
few
essential
manufactures
had
also
been
revived
mostly
in
the
form
of
machine
shops
to
decontaminate
engine
parts
negotiations
were
under
way
to
try
to
move
the
great
wheat
and
other
grain
stocks
of
the
midwest
down
the
mississippi
river
to
new
orleans
and
through
the
panama
canal
to
the
pacific
coast
cities
oldtime
sailing
vessels
rotting
from
years
of
disuse
were
being
rebuilt
for
this
purpose
ken
found
it
hard
to
envision
the
earth
stirring
with
this
much
life
after
the
destruction
that
had
passed
over
it
in
the
civilized
areas
it
was
estimated
that
fully
of
the
population
had
perished
only
in
the
most
primitive
areas
had
the
comet
effect
been
lightly
felt
yet
around
the
world
the
cities
were
stirring
again
food
for
the
surviving
was
being
found
the
hates
and
the
terrors
were
being
put
away
and
men
were
pulling
together
again
to
restore
their
civilization
maria
came
to
the
radio
shack
to
tell
him
dinner
was
ready
he
invited
her
to
join
him
for
a
moment
it
may
be
possible
for
you
and
your
father
to
return
to
sweden
much
sooner
that
we
thought
he
said
maria
shook
her
head
we
are
going
back
now
we
talked
about
it
and
decided
to
stay
it
as
papa
always
said
where
so
much
happens
to
you
that
the
place
you
always
call
home
more
has
happened
to
us
in
a
year
here
than
in
a
lifetime
back
there
ken
laughed
that
a
funny
way
to
look
at
it
especially
after
the
kind
of
things
that
have
happened
to
you
here
maybe
your
father
is
right
at
that
all
our
friends
are
here
now
she
said
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
wonderful
ken
said
with
a
rising
surge
of
happiness
in
him
i
mean
he
added
in
sudden
confusion
i
glad
you
decided
this
is
the
best
place
to
live
he
changed
the
subject
quickly
dad
even
talking
of
trying
to
start
up
a
kind
of
college
here
again
we
would
have
the
buildings
of
course
but
it
could
be
done
in
houses
or
somewhere
else
he
says
been
thinking
a
lot
about
it
and
considers
it
would
be
our
greatest
mistake
to
neglect
the
continuance
of
our
education
so
i
guess
you
can
finish
school
right
here
personally
i
think
all
the
professors
out
there
trying
to
be
dirt
farmers
just
got
tired
after
a
couple
of
days
of
plowing
and
decided
something
would
have
to
be
done
about
situation
maria
laughed
do
be
too
hard
on
them
papa
told
me
about
the
plan
too
he
says
sheriff
johnson
has
agreed
to
guarantee
their
pay
in
food
and
other
necessities
he
stepping
down
now
so
there
can
be
an
election
but
he
demanding
approval
of
that
program
before
he
leaves
office
i
do
think
they
ought
to
let
him
go
he
be
said
ken
he
on
top
of
the
heap
now
i
even
heard
old
hank
moss
chewing
out
some
guys
in
town
for
criticizing
johnson
ken
closed
down
the
transmitter
and
receiver
for
the
night
together
he
and
maria
walked
to
the
house
they
stopped
on
the
back
porch
and
glanced
toward
the
distant
projector
bowls
reflecting
the
light
of
the
comet
and
of
the
sun
soon
there
would
be
only
the
sun
to
shine
in
the
sky
