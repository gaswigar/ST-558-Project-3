preface
this
volume
of
memoirs
has
a
double
character
historical
and
intimate
the
life
of
a
period
the
xix
century
is
bound
up
in
the
life
of
a
man
victor
hugo
as
we
follow
the
events
set
forth
we
get
the
impression
they
made
upon
the
mind
of
the
extraordinary
man
who
recounts
them
and
of
all
the
personages
he
brings
before
us
he
himself
is
assuredly
not
the
least
interesting
in
portraits
from
the
brushes
of
rembrandts
there
are
always
two
portraits
that
of
the
model
and
that
of
the
painter
this
is
not
a
diary
of
events
arranged
in
chronological
order
nor
is
it
a
continuous
autobiography
it
is
less
and
it
is
more
or
rather
it
is
better
than
these
it
is
a
sort
of
haphazard
in
which
only
striking
incidents
and
occurrences
are
brought
out
and
lengthy
and
wearisome
details
are
avoided
victor
hugo
s
long
and
chequered
life
was
filled
with
experiences
of
the
most
diverse
character
literature
and
politics
the
court
and
the
street
parliament
and
the
theatre
labour
struggles
disappointments
exile
and
triumphs
hence
we
get
a
series
of
pictures
of
infinite
variety
let
us
pass
the
gallery
rapidly
in
review
it
opens
in
at
rheims
during
the
coronation
of
charles
x
with
an
amusing
on
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
restoration
the
splendour
of
this
coronation
ceremony
was
singularly
spoiled
by
the
pitiable
taste
of
those
who
had
charge
of
it
these
worthies
took
upon
themselves
to
mutilate
the
sculpture
work
on
the
marvellous
façade
and
to
embellish
the
austere
cathedral
with
gothic
decorations
of
cardboard
the
century
like
the
author
was
young
and
in
some
things
both
were
incredibly
ignorant
the
masterpieces
of
literature
were
then
unknown
to
the
most
learned
charles
nodier
had
never
read
the
romancero
and
victor
hugo
knew
little
or
nothing
about
shakespeare
at
the
outset
the
poet
dominates
in
victor
hugo
he
belongs
wholly
to
his
creative
imagination
and
to
his
literary
work
it
is
the
theatre
it
is
his
cid
and
hernani
with
its
stormy
performances
it
is
the
group
of
his
actors
mlle
mars
mlle
georges
frederick
lemaitre
the
french
kean
with
more
genius
it
is
the
academy
with
its
different
kind
of
coteries
about
this
time
victor
hugo
questions
anxiously
and
not
in
vain
a
who
witnessed
the
execution
of
louis
xvi
and
an
officer
who
escorted
napoleon
to
paris
on
his
return
from
the
island
of
elba
next
under
the
title
visions
of
the
real
come
some
sketches
in
the
master
s
best
style
of
things
seen
in
the
mind
s
eye
as
hamlet
says
among
them
the
hovel
will
attract
attention
this
sketch
resembles
a
page
from
edgar
poe
although
it
was
written
long
before
poe
s
works
were
introduced
into
france
with
love
in
prison
victor
hugo
deals
with
social
questions
in
which
he
was
more
interested
than
in
political
questions
and
yet
in
entering
the
chamber
of
peers
he
enters
public
life
his
sphere
is
enlarged
he
becomes
one
of
the
familiars
of
the
tuileries
louis
philippe
verbose
and
full
of
recollections
that
he
is
fond
of
imparting
to
others
seeks
the
company
and
appreciation
of
this
listener
of
note
and
makes
all
sorts
of
confidences
to
him
the
king
with
his
very
haughty
bonhomie
and
his
somewhat
infatuated
wisdom
the
grave
and
sweet
duchess
d
orleans
the
boisterous
and
amiable
princes
the
whole
commonplace
and
court
are
depicted
with
kindliness
but
sincerity
the
horizon
however
grows
dark
and
from
the
new
peer
of
france
notes
the
gradual
tottering
of
the
edifice
of
royalty
the
revolution
of
bursts
out
nothing
could
be
more
thrilling
than
the
account
hour
by
hour
of
the
events
of
the
three
days
of
february
victor
hugo
is
not
merely
a
spectator
of
this
great
drama
he
is
an
actor
in
it
he
is
in
the
streets
he
makes
speeches
to
the
people
he
seeks
to
restrain
them
he
believes
with
too
good
reason
that
the
republic
is
premature
and
in
the
place
de
la
bastille
before
the
evolutionary
faubourg
saint
antoine
he
dares
to
proclaim
the
regency
four
months
later
distress
provokes
the
formidable
insurrection
of
june
which
is
fatal
to
the
republic
the
year
is
the
stormy
year
the
atmosphere
is
fiery
men
are
violent
events
are
tragical
battles
in
the
streets
are
followed
by
fierce
debates
in
the
assembly
victor
hugo
takes
part
in
the
mêlée
we
witness
the
scenes
with
him
he
points
out
the
chief
actors
to
us
his
sketches
made
in
the
national
assembly
are
sketched
from
life
in
the
fullest
acceptation
of
the
term
twenty
lines
suffice
odilon
barrot
and
changarnier
prudhon
and
blanqui
lamartine
and
monsieur
thiers
come
go
speak
veritable
living
figures
the
most
curious
of
the
figures
is
louis
bonaparte
when
he
arrived
in
paris
and
when
he
assumed
the
presidency
of
the
republic
he
is
gauche
affected
somewhat
ridiculous
distrusted
by
the
republicans
and
scoffed
at
by
the
royalists
nothing
could
be
more
suggestive
or
more
piquant
than
the
inauguration
dinner
at
the
elysee
at
which
victor
hugo
was
one
of
the
guests
and
the
first
and
courteous
relations
between
the
author
of
napoleon
the
little
and
the
future
emperor
who
was
to
inflict
twenty
years
of
exile
upon
him
but
now
we
come
to
the
year
which
victor
hugo
has
designated
the
terrible
year
the
war
and
the
siege
of
paris
this
part
of
the
volume
is
made
up
of
extracts
from
private
and
personal
notes
dotted
down
from
day
to
day
which
is
to
say
that
they
do
not
constitute
an
account
of
the
episodes
of
the
siege
but
tell
something
new
the
little
side
of
great
events
the
little
incidents
of
everyday
life
the
number
of
shells
fired
into
the
city
and
what
they
cost
the
degrees
of
cold
the
price
of
provisions
what
is
being
said
sung
and
eaten
and
at
the
same
time
give
the
psychology
of
the
great
city
its
illusions
revolts
wrath
anguish
and
also
its
gaiety
for
during
these
long
months
paris
never
gave
up
hope
and
preserved
an
heroic
cheerfulness
on
the
other
hand
a
painful
note
runs
through
the
diary
kept
during
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
at
bordeaux
france
is
not
only
vanquished
she
is
mutilated
the
conqueror
demands
a
ransom
of
milliards
it
is
his
right
the
right
of
the
strongest
but
he
tears
from
her
two
provinces
with
their
inhabitants
devoted
to
france
it
is
a
return
towards
barbarism
victor
hugo
withdraws
indignantly
from
the
assembly
which
has
agreed
to
endorse
the
treaty
of
frankfort
and
three
days
after
his
resignation
he
sees
charles
hugo
his
eldest
son
die
a
victim
to
the
privations
of
the
siege
he
is
stricken
at
once
in
his
love
of
country
and
in
his
paternal
love
and
one
can
say
that
in
these
painful
pages
more
than
in
any
of
the
others
the
book
is
history
that
has
been
lived
paul
maurice
paris
at
rheims
it
was
at
rheims
that
i
heard
the
name
of
shakespeare
for
the
first
time
it
was
pronounced
by
charles
nodier
that
was
in
during
the
coronation
of
charles
x
no
one
at
that
time
spoke
of
shakespeare
quite
seriously
voltaire
s
ridicule
of
him
was
law
mme
de
staël
had
adopted
germany
the
great
land
of
kant
of
schiller
and
of
beethoven
ducis
was
at
the
height
of
his
triumph
he
and
delille
were
seated
side
by
side
in
academic
glory
which
is
not
unlike
theatrical
glory
ducis
had
succeeded
in
doing
something
with
shakespeare
he
had
made
him
possible
he
had
extracted
some
tragedies
from
him
ducis
impressed
one
as
being
a
man
who
could
chisel
an
apollo
out
of
moloch
it
was
the
time
when
iago
was
called
pezare
horatio
norceste
and
desdemona
hedelmone
a
charming
and
very
witty
woman
the
duchess
de
duras
used
to
say
desdemona
what
an
ugly
name
fie
talma
prince
of
denmark
in
a
tunic
of
lilac
satin
trimmed
with
fur
used
to
exclaim
avaunt
dread
spectre
the
poor
spectre
in
fact
was
only
tolerated
behind
the
scenes
if
it
had
ventured
to
put
in
the
slightest
appearance
evariste
dumoulin
would
have
given
it
a
severe
talking
to
some
génin
or
other
would
have
hurled
at
it
the
first
he
could
lay
his
hand
on
a
line
from
boileau

est
point
ému
de
ce
qu
il
ne
croit
it
was
replaced
on
the
stage
by
an
urn
that
talma
carried
under
his
arm
a
spectre
is
ridiculous
ashes
that
s
the
style
are
not
the
ashes
of
napoleon
still
spoken
of
is
not
the
translation
of
the
coffin
from
helena
to
the
invalides
alluded
to
as
the
return
of
the
ashes
as
to
the
witches
of
macbeth
they
were
rigorously
barred
the
of
the
had
his
orders
they
would
have
been
received
with
their
own
brooms
i
am
mistaken
however
in
saying
that
i
did
not
know
shakespeare
i
knew
him
as
everybody
else
did
not
having
read
him
and
having
treated
him
with
ridicule
my
childhood
began
as
everybody
s
childhood
begins
with
prejudices
man
finds
prejudices
beside
his
cradle
puts
them
from
him
a
little
in
the
course
of
his
career
and
often
alas
takes
to
them
again
in
his
old
age
during
this
journey
in
charles
nodier
and
i
passed
our
time
recounting
to
each
other
the
gothic
tales
and
romances
that
have
taken
root
in
rheims
our
memories
and
sometimes
our
imaginations
clubbed
together
each
of
us
furnished
his
legend
rheims
is
one
of
the
most
impossible
towns
in
the
geography
of
story
pagan
lords
have
lived
there
one
of
whom
gave
as
a
dower
to
his
daughter
the
strips
of
land
in
borysthenes
called
the
of
the
duke
de
guyenne
in
the
fabliaux
passes
through
rheims
on
his
way
to
besiege
babylon
babylon
moreover
which
is
very
worthy
of
rheims
is
the
capital
of
the
admiral
gaudissius
it
is
at
rheims
that
the
deputation
sent
by
the
locri
ozolae
to
apollonius
of
tyana
high
priest
of
bellona
while
discussing
this
disembarkation
we
argued
concerning
the
locri
ozolae
these
people
according
to
nodier
were
called
the
fetidae
because
they
were
half
monkeys
according
to
myself
because
they
inhabited
the
marshes
of
phocis
we
reconstructed
on
the
spot
the
tradition
of
remigius
and
his
adventures
with
the
fairy
mazelane
the
champagne
country
is
rich
in
tales
nearly
all
the
old
gaulish
fables
had
their
origin
in
this
province
rheims
is
the
land
of
chimeras
it
is
perhaps
for
this
reason
that
kings
were
crowned
there
legends
are
so
natural
to
this
place
are
in
such
good
soil
that
they
immediately
began
to
germinate
upon
the
coronation
of
charles
itself
the
duke
of
northumberland
the
representative
of
england
at
the
coronation
ceremonies
was
reputed
fabulously
wealthy
wealthy
and
english
how
could
he
be
otherwise
than
la
the
english
at
that
period
were
very
popular
in
french
society
although
not
among
the
people
they
were
liked
in
certain
salons
because
of
waterloo
which
was
still
fairly
recent
and
to
anglicize
the
french
language
was
a
recommendation
in
society
lord
northumberland
therefore
long
before
his
arrival
was
popular
and
legendary
in
rheims
a
coronation
was
a
godsend
to
rheims
a
flood
of
opulent
people
inundated
the
city
it
was
the
nile
that
was
passing
landlords
rubbed
their
hands
with
glee
there
was
in
rheims
in
those
days
and
there
probably
is
at
the
corner
of
a
street
giving
on
to
the
square
a
rather
large
house
with
a
and
a
balcony
built
of
stone
in
the
royal
style
of
louis
and
facing
the
cathedral
about
this
house
and
lord
northumberland
the
following
was
related
in
january
the
balcony
of
the
house
bore
the
notice
house
for
all
at
once
the
moniteur
announced
that
the
coronation
of
charles
would
take
place
at
rheims
in
the
spring
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
city
notices
of
rooms
to
let
were
immediately
hung
out
everywhere
the
meanest
room
was
to
bring
in
at
least
sixty
francs
a
day
one
morning
a
man
of
irreproachable
appearance
dressed
in
black
with
a
white
cravat
an
englishman
who
spoke
broken
french
presented
himself
at
the
house
in
the
square
he
saw
the
proprietor
who
eyed
him
attentively
you
wish
to
sell
your
house
queried
the
englishman
how
much
ten
thousand
but
i
don
t
want
to
buy
what
do
you
want
then
only
to
hire
that
s
different
for
a
year
for
six
months
no
i
want
to
hire
it
for
three
how
much
will
you
charge
thirty
thousand
the
gentleman
was
lord
northumberland
s
steward
who
was
looking
for
a
lodging
for
his
master
for
the
coronation
ceremonies
the
proprietor
had
smelled
the
englishman
and
guessed
the
steward
the
house
was
satisfactory
and
the
proprietor
held
out
for
his
price
the
englishman
being
only
a
norman
gave
way
to
the
champenois
the
duke
paid
the
francs
and
spent
three
days
in
the
house
at
the
rate
of
francs
an
hour
nodier
and
i
were
two
explorers
when
we
travelled
together
as
we
occasionally
did
we
went
on
voyages
of
discovery
he
in
search
of
rare
books
i
in
search
of
ruins
he
would
go
into
ecstasies
over
a
with
margins
and
i
over
a
defaced
portal
we
had
given
each
other
a
devil
he
said
to
me
you
are
possessed
of
the
demon
and
you
i
answered
of
the
demon
at
soissons
while
i
was
exploring
saint
he
had
discovered
in
a
suburb
a
ragpicker
the
ragpicker
s
basket
is
the
hyphen
between
rags
and
paper
and
the
ragpicker
is
the
hyphen
between
the
beggar
and
the
philosopher
nodier
who
gave
to
the
poor
and
sometimes
to
philosophers
had
entered
the
ragpicker
s
abode
the
ragpicker
turned
out
to
be
a
book
dealer
among
the
books
nodier
noticed
a
rather
thick
volume
of
six
or
eight
hundred
pages
printed
in
spanish
two
columns
to
a
page
badly
damaged
by
worms
and
the
binding
missing
from
the
back
the
ragpicker
asked
what
he
wanted
for
it
replied
trembling
lest
the
price
should
be
refused
five
francs
which
nodier
paid
also
trembling
but
with
joy
this
book
was
the
complete
there
are
only
three
complete
copies
of
this
edition
now
in
existence
one
of
these
a
few
years
ago
sold
for
francs
moreover
worms
are
vying
with
each
other
in
eating
up
these
three
remaining
copies
the
peoples
feeders
of
princes
have
something
else
to
do
than
spend
their
money
to
preserve
for
new
editions
the
legacies
of
human
intellect
and
the
being
merely
an
iliad
has
not
been
reprinted
during
the
three
days
of
the
coronation
there
were
great
crowds
in
the
streets
of
rheims
at
the
archbishop
s
palace
and
on
the
promenades
along
the
vesdre
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
charles
i
said
to
charles
nodier
let
us
go
and
see
his
majesty
the
rheims
is
a
proverb
in
gothic
christian
art
one
speaks
of
the
nave
of
amiens
the
bell
towers
of
chartres
the
façade
of
a
month
before
the
coronation
of
charles
x
a
swarm
of
masons
perched
on
ladders
and
clinging
to
knotted
ropes
spent
a
week
smashing
with
hammers
every
bit
of
jutting
sculpture
on
the
façade
for
fear
a
stone
might
become
detached
from
one
of
these
reliefs
and
fall
on
the
king
s
head
the
debris
littered
the
pavement
and
was
swept
away
for
a
long
time
i
had
in
my
possession
a
head
of
christ
that
fell
in
this
way
it
was
stolen
from
me
in
this
head
was
unfortunate
broken
by
a
king
it
was
lost
by
an
exile
nodier
was
an
admirable
antiquary
and
we
explored
the
cathedral
from
top
to
bottom
encumbered
though
it
was
with
scaffolding
painted
scenery
and
stage
side
lights
the
nave
being
only
of
stone
they
had
hidden
it
by
an
edifice
of
cardboard
doubtless
because
the
latter
bore
a
greater
resemblance
to
the
monarchy
of
that
period
for
the
coronation
of
the
king
of
france
they
had
transformed
a
church
into
a
theatres
and
it
has
since
been
related
with
perfect
accuracy
that
on
arriving
at
the
entrance
i
asked
of
the
bodyguard
on
duty
where
is
my
box
this
cathedral
of
rheims
is
beautiful
above
all
cathedrals
on
the
façade
are
kings
on
the
absis
people
being
put
to
the
torture
by
executioners
coronation
of
kings
with
an
accompaniment
of
victims
the
façade
is
one
of
the
most
magnificent
symphonies
ever
sung
by
that
music
architecture
one
dreams
for
a
long
time
before
this
oratorio
looking
up
from
the
square
you
see
at
a
giddy
height
at
the
base
of
the
two
towers
a
row
of
gigantic
statues
representing
kings
of
france
in
their
hands
they
hold
the
sceptre
the
sword
the
hand
of
justice
and
the
globe
and
on
their
heads
are
antique
open
crowns
with
bulging
gems
it
is
superb
and
grim
you
push
open
the
s
door
climb
the
winding
staircase
the
screw
of
giles
to
the
towers
to
the
high
regions
of
prayer
you
look
down
and
the
statues
are
below
you
the
row
of
kings
is
plunging
into
the
abysm
you
hear
the
whispering
of
the
enormous
bells
which
vibrate
at
the
kiss
of
vague
zephyrs
from
the
sky
one
day
i
gazed
down
from
the
top
of
the
tower
through
an
embrasure
the
entire
façade
sheered
straight
below
me
i
perceived
in
the
depth
on
top
of
a
long
stone
support
that
extended
down
the
wall
directly
beneath
me
to
the
escarpment
so
that
its
form
was
lost
a
sort
of
round
basin
had
collected
there
and
formed
a
narrow
mirror
at
the
bottom
there
were
also
a
tuft
of
grass
with
flowers
in
it
and
a
swallow
s
nest
thus
in
a
space
only
two
feet
in
diameter
were
a
lake
a
garden
and
a
habitation
a
birds
paradise
as
i
gazed
the
swallow
was
giving
water
to
her
brood
round
the
upper
edge
of
the
basin
were
what
looked
like
crenelles
and
between
these
the
swallow
had
built
her
nest
i
examined
these
crenelles
they
had
the
form
of
the
support
was
a
statue
this
happy
little
world
was
the
stone
crown
of
an
old
king
and
if
god
were
asked
of
what
use
was
this
lothario
this
philip
this
charles
this
louis
this
emperor
this
king
god
peradventure
would
reply
he
had
this
statue
made
and
lodged
a
the
coronation
occurred
this
is
not
the
place
to
describe
it
besides
my
recollections
of
the
ceremony
of
may
have
been
recounted
elsewhere
by
another
more
ably
than
i
could
set
them
forth
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
was
a
radiant
day
god
seemed
to
have
given
his
assent
to
the
fête
the
long
clear
windows
for
there
are
no
more
windows
at
rheims
let
in
bright
daylight
all
the
light
of
may
was
in
the
church
the
archbishop
was
covered
with
gilding
and
the
altar
with
rays
marshal
de
lauriston
minister
of
the
king
s
household
rejoiced
at
the
sunshine
he
came
and
went
as
busy
as
could
be
and
conversed
in
low
tones
with
lecointe
and
hittorf
the
architects
the
fine
morning
afforded
the
occasion
to
say
the
sun
of
the
coronation
as
one
used
to
say
the
sun
of
and
in
the
resplendent
light
a
profusion
of
lamps
and
tapers
found
means
to
beam
at
one
moment
charles
attired
in
a
simar

with

lay
at

covered
the
old
flagstones
from
one
end
of
the
cathedral
to
the
other
and
concealed
the
tombstones
in
the
pavement
thick
luminous
smoke
of
incense
filled
the
nave
the
birds
that
had
been
set
at
liberty
flew
wildly
about
in
this
cloud
the
king
changed
his
costume
six
or
seven
times
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
louis
philippe
duke
d
orleans
aided
him
the
duke
de
bordeaux
who
was
five
years
old
was
in
a
gallery
the
pew
in
which
nodier
and
i
were
seated
adjoined
those
of
the
deputies
in
the
middle
of
the
ceremony
just
before
the
king
prostrated
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
archbishop
a
deputy
for
the
doubs
department
named
hémonin
turned
towards
nodier
who
was
close
to
him
and
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
a
sign
that
he
did
not
wish
to
disturb
the
archbishop
s
orisons
by
speaking
slipped
something
into
my
friend
s
hand
this
something
was
a
book
nodier
took
it
and
glanced
over
it
what
is
it
i
whispered
nothing
very
precious
he
replied
an
odd
volume
of
shakespeare
glasgow
one
of
the
tapestries
from
the
treasure
of
the
church
hanging
exactly
opposite
to
us
represented
a
not
very
historical
interview
between
john
lackland
and
philip
augustus
nodier
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
for
a
few
minutes
then
pointed
to
the
tapestry
you
see
that
tapestry
do
you
know
what
it
represents
john
well
what
of
it
john
lackland
is
also
in
this
the
volume
which
was
in
sheep
binding
and
worn
at
the
corners
was
indeed
a
copy
of
hémonin
turned
to
nodier
and
said
i
paid
six
sous
for
in
the
evening
the
duke
of
northumberland
gave
a
ball
it
was
a
magnificent
fairylike
spectacle
this
arabian
nights
ambassador
brought
one
of
these
nights
to
rheims
every
woman
found
a
diamond
in
her
bouquet
i
could
not
dance
nodier
had
not
danced
since
he
was
sixteen
years
of
age
when
a
great
aunt
went
into
ecstasies
over
his
terpsichorean
efforts
and
congratulated
him
in
the
following
terms
est
charmant
tu
danses
comme
rim
we
did
not
go
to
lord
northumberland
s
ball
what
shall
we
do
tonight
said
i
to
nodier
he
held
up
his
odd
volume
and
answered
let
us
read
we
read
that
is
to
say
nodier
read
he
knew
english
without
being
able
to
speak
it
i
believe
enough
to
make
it
out
he
read
aloud
and
translated
as
he
read
at
intervals
while
he
rested
i
took
the
book
bought
from
the
ragpicker
of
soissons
and
read
passages
from
the
like
nodier
i
translated
as
i
read
we
compared
the
english
with
the
castilian
book
we
confronted
the
dramatic
with
the
epic
nodier
stood
up
for
shakespeare
whom
he
could
read
in
english
and
i
for
the
which
i
could
read
in
spanish
we
brought
face
to
face
he
the
bastard
faulconbridge
i
the
bastard
mudarra
and
little
by
little
in
contradicting
we
convinced
each
other
and
nodier
became
filled
with
enthusiasm
for
the
and
i
with
admiration
for
shakespeare
listeners
arrived
one
passes
the
evening
as
best
one
can
in
a
provincial
town
on
a
coronation
day
when
one
doesn
t
go
to
the
ball
we
formed
quite
a
little
club
there
was
an
academician
roger
a
man
of
letters
d
eckstein
de
marcellus
friend
and
country
neighbour
of
my
father
who
poked
fun
at
his
royalism
and
mine
good
old
marquis
d
herbouville
and
hémonin
donor
of
the
book
that
cost
six
sous
it
isn
t
worth
the
money
exclaimed
roger
the
conversation
developed
into
a
debate
judgment
was
passed
upon
de
marcellus
declared
that
the
assassination
of
arthur
was
an
improbable
incident
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
it
was
a
matter
of
history
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
became
reconciled
to
it
for
kings
to
kill
each
other
was
impossible
to
de
marcellus
s
mind
the
murdering
of
kings
began
on
january
regicide
was
synonymous
with
to
kill
a
king
was
an
thing
that
the
populace
alone
were
capable
of
doing
no
king
except
louis
xvi
had
ever
been
violently
put
to
death
he
however
reluctantly
admitted
the
case
of
charles
i
in
his
death
also
he
saw
the
hand
of
the
populace
all
the
rest
was
demagogic
lying
and
calumny
although
as
good
a
royalist
as
he
i
ventured
to
insinuate
that
the
sixteenth
century
had
existed
and
that
it
was
the
period
when
the
jesuits
had
clearly
propounded
the
question
of
bleeding
the
basilic
vein
that
is
to
say
of
cases
in
which
the
king
ought
to
be
slain
a
question
which
once
brought
forward
met
with
such
success
that
it
resulted
in
two
kings
henry
iii
and
henry
being
stabbed
and
a
jesuit
father
guignard
being
hanged
then
we
passed
to
the
details
of
the
drama
situations
scenes
and
personages
nodier
pointed
out
that
faulconbridge
is
the
same
person
spoken
of
by
mathieu
paris
as
falcasius
de
trente
bastard
of
richard
coeur
de
lion
baron
d
eckstein
in
support
of
this
reminded
his
hearers
that
according
to
hollinshed
faulconbridge
or
falcasius
slew
the
viscount
de
limoges
to
avenge
his
father
richard
who
had
been
wounded
unto
death
at
the
siege
of
chaluz
and
that
this
castle
of
chaluz
being
the
property
of
the
viscount
de
limoges
it
was
only
right
that
the
viscount
although
absent
should
be
made
to
answer
with
his
head
for
the
falling
of
an
arrow
or
a
stone
from
the
castle
upon
the
king
roger
laughed
at
the
cry
of
austria
limoges
in
the
play
and
at
shakespeare
s
confounding
the
viscount
de
limoges
with
the
duke
of
austria
roger
scored
the
success
of
the
evening
and
his
laughter
settled
the
matter
the
discussion
having
taken
this
turn
i
said
nothing
further
this
revelation
of
shakespeare
had
moved
me
his
grandeur
impressed
me
is
not
a
masterpiece
but
certain
scenes
are
lofty
and
powerful
and
in
the
motherhood
of
constance
there
are
bursts
of
genius
the
two
books
open
and
reversed
remained
lying
upon
the
table
the
company
had
ceased
to
read
in
order
to
laugh
nodier
at
length
became
silent
like
myself
we
were
beaten
the
gathering
broke
up
with
a
laugh
and
our
visitors
went
away
nodier
and
i
remained
alone
and
pensive
thinking
of
the
great
works
that
are
unappreciated
and
amazed
that
the
intellectual
education
of
the
civilized
peoples
and
even
our
own
his
and
mine
had
advanced
no
further
than
this
at
last
nodier
broke
the
silence
i
can
see
his
smile
now
as
he
said
they
know
nothing
about
the
romancero
i
replied
and
they
deride
shakespeare
thirteen
years
later
chance
took
me
to
rheims
again
it
was
on
august
it
will
be
seen
further
on
why
this
date
impressed
itself
on
my
memory
i
was
returning
from
vouziers
and
seeing
the
two
towers
of
rheims
in
the
distance
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
visit
the
cathedral
again
i
therefore
went
to
rheims
on
arriving
in
the
cathedral
square
i
saw
a
gun
drawn
up
near
the
portal
and
beside
it
gunners
with
lighted
fuses
in
their
hands
as
i
had
seen
artillery
there
on
may
i
supposed
it
was
customary
to
keep
a
cannon
in
the
square
and
paid
little
attention
to
it
i
passed
on
and
entered
the
church
a
beadle
in
violet
sleeves
a
sort
of
priest
took
me
in
charge
and
conducted
me
all
over
the
church
the
stones
were
dark
the
statues
dismal
the
altar
mysterious
no
lamps
competed
with
the
sun
the
latter
threw
upon
the
sepulchral
stones
in
the
pavement
the
long
white
silhouettes
of
the
windows
which
through
the
melancholy
obscurity
of
the
rest
of
the
church
looked
like
phantoms
lying
upon
these
tombs
no
one
was
in
the
church
not
a
whisper
not
a
footfall
could
be
heard
this
solitude
saddened
the
heart
and
enraptured
the
soul
there
were
in
it
abandonment
neglect
oblivion
exile
and
sublimity
gone
the
whirl
of
the
church
had
resumed
its
dignity
and
its
calmness
not
a
piece
of
finery
not
a
vestment
not
anything
it
was
bare
and
beautiful
the
lofty
vault
no
longer
supported
a
canopy
ceremonies
of
the
palace
arc
not
suited
to
these
severe
places
a
coronation
ceremony
is
merely
tolerated
these
noble
ruins
are
not
made
to
be
courtiers
to
rid
it
of
the
throne
and
withdraw
the
king
from
the
presence
of
god
increases
the
majesty
of
a
temple
louis
xiv
hides
jehovah
from
sight
withdraw
the
priest
as
well
all
that
eclipsed
it
having
been
taken
away
you
will
see
the
light
of
day
direct
orisons
rites
bibles
formulas
refract
and
decompose
the
sacred
light
a
dogma
is
a
dark
chamber
through
a
religion
you
see
the
solar
spectre
of
god
but
not
god
desuetude
and
crumbling
enhance
the
grandeur
of
a
temple
as
human
religion
retires
from
this
mysterious
and
jealous
edifice
divine
religion
enters
it
let
solitude
reign
in
it
and
you
will
feel
heaven
there
a
sanctuary
deserted
and
in
ruins
like
jumièges
like
bertin
like
villers
like
holyrood
like
montrose
abbey
like
the
temple
of
paestum
like
the
hypogeum
of
thebes
becomes
almost
an
element
and
possesses
the
virginal
and
religious
grandeur
of
a
savannah
or
of
a
forest
there
something
of
the
real
presence
is
to
be
found
such
places
are
truly
holy
man
has
meditated
and
communed
with
himself
therein
what
they
contained
of
truth
has
remained
and
become
greater
the
has
no
longer
any
voice
extinct
dogmas
have
not
left
their
ashes
the
prayer
of
the
past
has
left
its
perfume
there
is
something
of
the
absolute
in
prayer
and
because
of
this
that
which
was
a
synagogue
that
which
was
a
mosque
that
which
was
a
pagoda
is
venerable
a
stone
on
which
that
great
anxiety
that
is
called
prayer
has
left
its
impress
is
never
treated
with
ridicule
by
the
thinker
the
trace
left
by
those
who
have
bowed
down
before
the
infinite
is
always
imposing
in
strolling
about
the
cathedral
i
had
climbed
to
the
triforium
then
under
the
arched
buttresses
then
to
the
top
of
the
edifice
the
under
the
pointed
roof
is
admirable
but
less
remarkable
than
the
forest
of
amiens
it
is
of
these
cathedral
attics
are
of
grim
appearance
one
could
almost
lose
one
s
self
in
the
labyrinths
of
rafters
squares
traverse
beams
superposed
joists
traves
architraves
girders
madriers
and
tangled
lines
and
curves
one
might
imagine
one
s
self
to
be
in
the
skeleton
of
babel
the
place
is
as
bare
as
a
garret
and
as
wild
as
a
cavern
the
wind
whistles
mournfully
through
it
rats
are
at
home
there
the
spiders
driven
from
the
timber
by
the
odour
of
chestnut
make
their
home
in
the
stone
of
the
basement
where
the
church
ends
and
the
roof
begins
and
low
down
in
the
obscurity
spin
their
webs
in
which
you
catch
your
face
one
respires
a
mysterious
dust
and
the
centuries
seem
to
mingle
with
one
s
breath
the
dust
of
churches
is
not
like
the
dust
of
houses
it
reminds
one
of
the
tomb
it
is
composed
of
ashes
the
flooring
of
these
colossal
garrets
has
crevices
in
it
through
which
one
can
look
down
into
the
abysm
the
church
below
in
the
corners
that
one
can
not
explore
are
pools
of
shadow
as
it
were
birds
of
prey
enter
through
one
window
and
go
out
through
the
other
lightning
is
also
familiar
with
these
high
mysterious
regions
sometimes
it
ventures
too
near
and
then
it
causes
the
conflagration
of
rouen
of
chartres
or
of
paul
s
london
my
guide
the
beadle
preceded
me
he
looked
at
the
dung
on
the
floor
and
tossed
his
head
he
knew
the
bird
by
its
manure
and
growled
between
his
teeth
this
is
a
rook
this
is
a
hawk
this
is
an
you
ought
to
study
the
human
heart
said
i
a
frightened
bat
flew
before
us
while
walking
almost
at
hazard
following
this
bat
looking
at
this
manure
of
the
birds
respiring
this
dust
in
this
obscurity
among
the
cobwebs
and
scampering
rats
we
came
to
a
dark
corner
in
which
on
a
big
wheelbarrow
i
could
just
distinguish
a
long
package
tied
with
string
and
that
looked
like
a
piece
of
rolled
up
cloth
what
is
that
i
asked
the
beadle
that
said
he
is
charles
s
coronation
i
stood
gazing
at
the
thing
and
as
i
did
so
i
am
telling
truthfully
what
occurred
there
was
a
deafening
report
that
sounded
like
a
only
it
came
from
below
it
shook
the
and
echoed
and
through
the
church
it
was
succeeded
by
a
second
roar
then
a
third
at
regular
intervals
i
recognised
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
and
remembered
the
gun
i
had
seen
in
the
square
i
turned
to
my
guide
what
is
that
noise
the
telegraph
has
been
at
work
and
the
cannon
has
been
what
does
it
mean
i
continued
it
means
said
the
beadle
that
a
grandson
has
just
been
born
to
louis
the
cannon
announced
the
birth
of
the
count
de
paris
these
are
my
recollections
of
rheims
recounted
by
i
the
execution
of
louis
xvi
ii
the
arrival
of
napoleon
i
in
paris
in
i
the
execution
of
louis
xvi
there
were
certain
characteristic
details
connected
with
the
execution
of
louis
xvi
that
are
not
recorded
in
history
they
were
recounted
to
me
by
an
and
are
here
published
for
the
first
time
this
eye
witness
was
one
leboucher
who
arrived
in
paris
from
bourges
in
december
and
was
present
at
the
execution
of
louis
xvi
in
he
recounted
to
victor
hugo
most
of
these
details
which
as
can
easily
be
imagined
had
impressed
themselves
deeply
upon
his
mind
the
scaffold
was
not
as
is
generally
believed
erected
in
the
very
centre
of
the
place
on
the
spot
where
the
obelisk
now
stands
but
on
a
spot
which
the
decree
of
the
provisional
executive
council
designates
in
these
precise
terms
between
the
pied
d
estal
and
the
what
was
this
pedestal
present
generations
who
have
seen
so
many
things
happen
so
many
statues
crumble
and
so
many
pedestals
overthrown
do
not
quite
know
what
meaning
to
give
to
this
very
vague
designation
and
would
be
embarrassed
to
tell
for
what
monument
the
mysterious
stone
which
the
executive
council
of
the
revolution
laconically
calls
the
pied
d
estal
served
as
a
base
this
stone
had
borne
the
statue
of
louis
xv
let
it
be
noted
that
this
strange
place
which
had
been
called
successively
the
place
louis
place
de
la
revolution
place
de
la
concorde
place
louis
place
du
and
place
des
and
which
could
not
retain
any
name
could
not
keep
any
monument
either
it
has
had
the
statue
of
louis
which
disappeared
an
expiatory
fountain
which
was
to
have
laved
the
bloody
centre
of
the
place
was
projected
but
not
even
the
first
stone
was
laid
a
rough
model
of
a
monument
to
the
charter
was
made
we
have
never
seen
anything
but
the
socle
of
this
monument
just
when
a
bronze
figure
representing
the
charter
of
was
about
to
be
erected
the
revolution
of
july
arrived
with
the
charter
of
the
pedestal
of
louis
xviii
vanished
as
fell
the
pedestal
of
louis
xv
now
on
this
same
spot
we
have
placed
the
obelisk
of
sesostris
it
required
thirty
centuries
for
the
great
desert
to
engulf
half
of
it
how
many
years
will
the
place
de
la
revolution
require
to
swallow
it
up
altogether
in
the
year
ii
of
the
republic
what
the
executive
council
called
the
pied
d
estal
was
nought
but
a
shapeless
and
hideous
block
it
was
a
sort
of
sinister
symbol
of
the
royalty
itself
its
ornaments
of
marble
and
bronze
had
been
wrenched
off
the
bare
stone
was
everywhere
split
and
cracked
on
the
four
sides
were
large
square
gaps
showing
the
places
where
the
destroyed
bas
reliefs
had
been
scarcely
could
a
remnant
of
the
entablature
still
be
distinguished
at
the
summit
of
the
pedestal
and
beneath
the
cornice
a
string
of
ovolos
defaced
and
worn
was
surmounted
by
what
architects
call
a
chaplet
of
on
the
table
of
the
pedestal
one
could
perceive
a
heap
of
debris
of
all
kinds
in
which
tufts
of
grass
were
growing
here
and
there
this
pile
of
nameless
things
had
replaced
the
royal
statue
the
scaffold
was
raised
a
few
steps
distant
from
this
ruin
a
little
in
rear
of
it
it
was
covered
with
long
planks
laid
transversely
that
masked
the
framework
a
ladder
without
banisters
or
balustrade
was
at
the
back
and
what
they
venture
to
call
the
head
of
this
horrible
construction
was
turned
towards
the
a
basket
of
cylindrical
shape
covered
with
leather
was
placed
at
the
spot
where
the
head
of
the
king
was
to
fall
to
receive
it
and
at
one
of
the
angles
of
the
entablature
to
the
right
of
the
ladder
could
be
discerned
a
long
wicker
basket
prepared
for
the
body
and
on
which
one
of
the
executioners
while
waiting
for
the
king
had
laid
his
hat
imagine
now
in
the
middle
of
the
place
these
two
lugubrious
things
a
few
paces
from
each
other
the
pedestal
of
louis
xv
and
the
scaffold
of
louis
xvi
that
is
to
say
the
ruins
of
royalty
dead
and
the
martyrdom
of
royalty
living
around
these
two
things
four
formidable
lines
of
armed
men
preserving
a
great
empty
square
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
crowd
to
the
left
of
the
scaffold
the
to
the
right
the
tuileries
which
neglected
and
left
at
the
mercy
of
the
public
had
become
an
unsightly
waste
of
dirt
heaps
and
trenches
and
over
these
melancholy
edifices
over
these
black
leafless
trees
over
this
gloomy
multitude
the
bleak
sombre
sky
of
a
winter
morning
and
one
will
have
an
idea
of
the
aspect
which
the
place
de
la
revolution
presented
at
the
moment
when
louis
in
the
carriage
of
the
mayor
of
paris
dressed
in
white
the
book
of
psalms
clasped
in
his
hands
arrived
there
to
die
at
a
few
minutes
after
ten
o
clock
on
january
strange
excess
of
abasement
and
misery
the
son
of
so
many
kings
bound
and
sacred
like
the
kings
of
egypt
was
to
be
consumed
between
two
layers
of
quicklime
and
to
this
french
royalty
which
at
versailles
had
had
a
throne
of
gold
and
at
denis
sixty
sarcophagi
of
granite
there
remained
but
a
platform
of
pine
and
a
wicker
coffin
here
are
some
unknown
details
the
executioners
numbered
four
two
only
performed
the
execution
the
third
stayed
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
the
fourth
was
on
the
waggon
which
was
to
convey
the
king
s
body
to
the
madeleine
cemetery
and
which
was
waiting
a
few
feet
from
the
scaffold
the
executioners
wore
breeches
coats
in
the
french
style
as
the
revolution
had
modified
it
and
hats
with
enormous
cockades
they
executed
the
king
with
their
hats
on
and
it
was
without
taking
his
hat
off
that
samson
seizing
by
the
hair
the
severed
head
of
louis
showed
it
to
the
people
and
for
a
few
moments
let
the
blood
from
it
trickle
upon
the
scaffold
at
the
same
time
his
valet
or
assistant
undid
what
were
called
les
sangles
straps
and
while
the
crowd
gazed
alternately
upon
the
king
s
body
dressed
entirely
in
white
as
i
have
said
and
still
attached
with
the
hands
bound
behind
the
back
to
the
swing
board
and
upon
that
head
whose
kind
and
gentle
profile
stood
out
against
the
misty
sombre
trees
of
the
tuileries
two
priests
commissaries
of
the
commune
instructed
to
be
present
as
municipal
officials
at
the
execution
of
the
king
sat
in
the
mayor
s
carriage
laughing
and
conversing
in
loud
tones
one
of
them
jacques
roux
derisively
drew
the
other
s
attention
to
capet
s
fat
calves
and
abdomen
the
armed
men
who
surrounded
the
scaffold
had
only
swords
and
pikes
there
were
very
few
muskets
most
of
them
wore
large
round
hats
or
red
caps
a
few
platoons
of
mounted
dragoons
in
uniform
were
mingled
with
these
troops
at
intervals
a
whole
squadron
of
dragoons
was
ranged
in
battle
array
beneath
the
terraces
of
the
tuileries
what
was
called
the
battalion
of
marseilles
formed
one
of
the
sides
of
the
square
the
guillotine
it
is
always
with
repugnance
that
one
writes
this
hideous
word
would
appear
to
the
craftsmen
of
to
be
very
badly
constructed
the
knife
was
simply
suspended
to
a
pulley
fixed
in
the
centre
of
the
upper
beam
this
pulley
and
a
rope
the
thickness
of
a
man
s
thumb
constituted
the
whole
apparatus
the
knife
which
was
not
very
heavily
weighted
was
of
small
dimensions
and
had
a
curved
edge
which
gave
it
the
form
of
a
reversed
phrygian
cap
no
hood
was
placed
to
shelter
the
king
s
head
and
at
the
same
time
to
hide
and
circumscribe
its
fall
all
that
crowd
could
see
the
head
of
louis
xvi
drop
and
it
was
thanks
to
chance
thanks
perhaps
to
the
smallness
of
the
knife
which
diminished
the
violence
of
the
shock
that
it
did
not
bound
beyond
the
basket
to
the
pavement
terrible
incident
which
often
occurred
at
executions
during
the
terror
nowadays
assassins
and
poisoners
are
decapitated
more
decently
many
improvements
in
the
guillotine
have
been
made
at
the
spot
where
the
king
s
head
fell
a
long
rivulet
of
blood
streamed
down
the
planks
of
the
scaffold
to
the
pavement
when
the
execution
was
over
samson
threw
to
the
people
the
king
s
coat
which
was
of
white
molleton
and
in
an
instant
it
disappeared
torn
by
a
thousand
hands
at
the
moment
when
the
head
of
louis
xvi
fell
the
abbé
edgeworth
was
still
near
the
king
the
blood
spirted
upon
him
he
hastily
donned
a
brown
overcoat
descended
from
the
scaffold
and
was
lost
in
the
crowd
the
first
row
of
spectators
opened
before
him
with
a
sort
of
wonder
mingled
with
respect
but
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
the
attention
of
everybody
was
still
so
concentrated
upon
the
centre
of
the
place
where
the
event
had
just
been
accomplished
that
nobody
took
any
further
notice
of
abbé
edgeworth
the
poor
priest
enveloped
in
his
thick
coat
which
concealed
the
blood
with
which
he
was
covered
fled
in
bewilderment
walking
as
one
in
a
dream
and
scarcely
knowing
where
he
was
going
however
with
that
sort
of
instinct
which
preserves
somnambulists
he
crossed
the
river
took
the
rue
du
bac
then
the
rue
du
regard
and
thus
managed
to
reach
the
house
of
mme
de
lézardière
near
the
barrière
du
maine
arrived
there
he
divested
himself
of
his
soiled
clothing
and
remained
for
several
hours
in
a
state
of
collapse
without
being
able
to
collect
a
thought
or
utter
a
word
some
royalists
who
rejoined
him
and
who
had
witnessed
the
execution
surrounded
the
abbé
edgeworth
and
reminded
him
of
the
adieu
he
had
addressed
to
the
king
son
of
louis
ascend
to
heaven
these
words
however
memorable
though
they
were
had
left
no
trace
on
the
mind
of
him
who
had
uttered
them
we
heard
them
said
the
witnesses
of
the
catastrophe
still
moved
and
thrilled
it
is
possible
he
replied
but
i
do
not
remember
having
said
such
a
abbé
edgeworth
lived
a
long
life
without
ever
being
able
to
remember
whether
he
really
did
pronounce
these
words
mme
de
lézardière
who
had
been
seriously
ill
for
more
than
a
month
was
unable
to
support
the
shock
of
the
death
of
louis

she
died
on
the
very
night
of

in

march
history
and
contemporaneous
memoirs
have
truncated
or
badly
related
or
even
omitted
altogether
certain
details
of
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
in
paris
on
march
but
living
witnesses
are
to
be
met
with
who
saw
them
and
who
rectify
or
complete
them
during
the
night
of
the
the
emperor
left
sens
he
arrived
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
at
fontainebleau
towards
five
o
clock
as
day
was
breaking
he
reviewed
the
few
troops
he
had
taken
with
him
and
those
who
had
rallied
to
him
at
fontainebleau
itself
they
were
of
every
corps
of
every
regiment
of
all
arms
a
little
of
the
grand
army
a
little
of
the
guard
at
six
o
clock
the
review
being
over
one
hundred
and
twenty
lancers
mounted
their
horses
and
went
on
ahead
to
wait
for
him
at
essonnes
these
lancers
were
commanded
by
colonel
galbois
now
lieutenant
general
and
who
has
recently
distinguished
himself
at
constantine
they
had
been
at
essonnes
scarcely
of
an
hour
resting
their
horses
when
the
carriage
of
the
emperor
arrived
the
escort
of
lancers
were
in
their
saddles
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
surrounded
the
carriage
which
immediately
started
off
again
without
having
changed
horses
the
emperor
stopped
on
the
way
at
the
large
villages
to
receive
petitions
from
the
inhabitants
and
the
submission
of
the
authorities
and
sometimes
to
listen
to
harangues
he
was
on
the
rear
seat
of
the
carriage
with
general
bertrand
in
full
uniform
seated
on
his
left
colonel
galbois
galloped
beside
the
door
on
the
emperor
s
side
the
door
on
bertrand
s
side
was
guarded
by
a
quartermaster
of
lancers
named
ferrès
a
wineshop
keeper
at
puteaux
a
former
and
very
brave
hussar
whom
the
emperor
knew
personally
and
addressed
by

no
one
on
the
road
approached
the
emperor
everything
that
was
intended
for
him
passed
through

hands
three
or
four
leagues
beyond
essonnes
the
imperial
cortege
found
the
road
suddenly
barred
by
general
colbert
at
the
head
of
two
squadrons
and
three
regiments
echelonned
towards
paris
general
colbert
had
been
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
of
lancers
from
which
the
detachment
that
escorted
the
emperor
had
been
drawn
he
recognised
his
lancers
and
his
lancers
recognised
him
they
cried
general
come
over
to
us
the
general
answered
my
children
do
your
duty
i
am
doing
then
he
turned
rein
and
went
off
to
the
right
across
country
with
a
few
mounted
men
who
followed
him
he
could
not
have
resisted
the

by
his

thus

iv
the

with
the

easter
daisy
i
the
hovel
you
want
a
description
of
this
hovel
i
hesitated
to
inflict
it
upon
you
but
you
want
it
i
faith
here
it
is
you
will
only
have
yourself
to
blame
it
is
your
fault
pshaw
you
say
i
know
what
it
is
a
bleared
bandy
ruin
some
old
house
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
an
old
house
it
is
very
much
worse
it
is
a
new
house
really
now
an
old
house
you
counted
upon
an
old
house
and
turned
up
your
nose
at
it
in
advance
ah
yes
old
houses
don
t
you
wish
you
may
get
them
a
dilapidated
cottage
why
don
t
you
know
that
a
dilapidated
cottage
is
simply
charming
a
thing
of
beauty
the
wall
is
of
beautiful
warm
and
strong
colour
with
moth
holes
birds
nests
old
nails
on
which
the
spider
hangs
his
web
a
thousand
amusing
things
that
break
its
evenness
the
window
is
only
a
dormer
but
from
it
protrude
long
poles
on
which
all
sorts
of
clothing
of
all
sorts
of
colours
hang
and
dry
in
the
tatters
red
rags
flags
of
poverty
that
give
to
the
hut
an
air
of
gaiety
and
are
resplendent
in
the
sunshine
the
door
is
cracked
and
black
but
approach
and
examine
it
you
will
without
doubt
find
upon
it
a
bit
of
antique
ironwork
of
the
time
of
louis
cut
out
like
a
piece
of
guipure
the
roof
is
full
of
crevices
but
in
each
crevice
there
is
a
convolvulus
that
will
blossom
in
the
spring
or
a
daisy
that
will
bloom
in
the
autumn
the
tiles
are
patched
with
thatch
of
course
they
are
i
should
say
so
it
affords
the
occasion
to
have
on
one
s
roof
a
colony
of
pink
dragon
flowers
and
wild
a
fine
green
grass
carpets
the
foot
of
this
decrepit
wall
the
ivy
climbs
joyously
up
it
and
cloaks
its
bareness
its
wounds
and
its
leprosy
mayhap
moss
covers
with
green
velvet
the
stone
seat
at
the
door
all
nature
takes
pity
upon
this
degraded
and
charming
thing
that
you
call
a
hovel
and
welcomes
it
hovel
honest
and
peaceful
old
dwelling
sweet
and
good
to
see
rejuvenated
every
year
by
april
and
may
perfumed
by
the
wallflower
and
inhabited
by
the
swallow
no
it
is
not
of
this
that
i
write
it
is
not
i
repeat
of
an
old
house
it
is
of
a
new
house
of
a
new
hovel
if
you
will
this
thing
has
not
been
built
longer
than
two
years
the
wall
has
that
hideous
and
glacial
whiteness
of
fresh
plaster
the
whole
is
wretched
mean
high
triangular
and
has
the
shape
of
a
piece
of
gruyère
cheese
cut
for
a
miser
a
dessert
there
are
new
doors
that
do
not
shut
properly
window
frames
with
white
panes
that
are
already
spangled
here
and
there
with
paper
stars
these
stars
are
cut
coquettishly
and
pasted
on
with
care
there
is
a
frightful
bogus
sumptuousness
about
the
place
that
causes
a
painful
impression
balconies
of
hollow
iron
badly
fixed
to
the
wall
trumpery
locks
already
rotten
round
the
fastenings
upon
which
vacillate
on
three
nails
horrible
ornaments
of
embossed
brass
that
are
becoming
covered
with
verdigris
shutters
painted
grey
that
are
getting
out
of
joint
not
because
they
are
but
because
they
were
made
of
green
wood
by
a
thieving
cabinet
maker
a
chilly
feeling
comes
over
you
as
you
look
at
the
house
on
entering
it
you
shiver
a
greenish
humidity
leaks
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
this
building
of
yesterday
is
already
a
ruin
it
is
more
than
a
ruin
it
is
a
disaster
one
feels
that
the
proprietor
is
bankrupt
and
that
the
contractor
has
fled
in
rear
of
the
house
a
wall
white
and
new
like
the
rest
encloses
a
space
in
which
a
drum
major
could
not
lie
at
full
length
this
is
called
the
garden
issuing
shiveringly
from
the
earth
is
a
little
tree
long
spare
and
sickly
which
seems
always
to
be
in
winter
for
it
has
not
a
single
leaf
this
broom
is
called
a
poplar
the
remainder
of
the
garden
is
strewn
with
old
potsherds
and
bottoms
of
bottles
among
them
one
notices
two
or
three
list
slippers
in
a
corner
on
top
of
a
heap
of
oyster
shells
is
an
old
tin
watering
can
painted
green
dented
rusty
and
cracked
inhabited
by
slugs
which
silver
it
with
their
trails
of
slime
let
us
enter
the
hovel
in
the
other
you
will
find
perhaps
a
ladder
rickety
as
regnier
says
from
the
top
to
the
here
you
will
find
a
staircase
this
staircase
ornamented
with
banisters
has
fifteen
or
twenty
wooden
steps
high
narrow
with
sharp
angles
which
rise
perpendicularly
to
the
first
floor
and
turn
upon
themselves
in
a
spiral
of
about
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
would
you
not
be
inclined
to
ask
for
a
ladder
at
the
top
of
these
stairs
if
you
get
there
is
the
room
to
give
an
idea
of
this
room
is
difficult
it
is
the
new
hovel
in
all
its
abominable
reality
wretchedness
is
everywhere
a
new
wretchedness
which
has
no
past
no
future
and
which
can
not
take
root
anywhere
one
divines
that
the
lodger
moved
in
yesterday
and
will
move
out
tomorrow
that
he
arrived
without
saying
whence
he
came
and
that
he
will
put
the
key
under
the
door
when
he
goes
away
the
wall
is
ornamented
with
dark
blue
paper

evokes
thoughts

asphyxiation

over

dirtiness

disgusting
odour

of
oil
and
tallow
and
dust
everywhere
in
the
corner
near
the
bed
stands
an
enormous
sack
of
shavings
and
on
a
chair
beside
the
sack
lies
an
old
newspaper
i
am
moved
by
curiosity
to
look
at
the
title
and
the
date
it
is
the
constitutionnel
of
april
and
now
what
can
i
add
i
have
not
told
the
most
horrible
thing
about
the
place
the
house
is
odious
the
room
is
abominable
the
pallet
is
hideous
but
all
that
is
nothing
when
i
entered
a
woman
was
sleeping
on
the
bed
a
woman
old
short
thickset
red
bloated
oily
tumefied
fat
dreadful
enormous
her
frightful
bonnet
which
was
awry
disclosed
the
side
of
her
head
which
was
grizzled
pink
and
bald
she
was
fully
dressed
she
wore
a
yellowish
fichu
a
brown
skirt
a
jacket
all
this
on
her
monstrous
abdomen
and
a
vast
soiled
apron
like
the
linen
trousers
of
a
convict
at
the
noise
i
made
in
entering
she
moved
sat
up
showed
her
fat
legs
that
were
covered
with
unqualifiable
blue
stockings
and
with
a
yawn
stretched
her
brawny
arms
which
terminated
with
fists
that
resembled
those
of
a
butcher
i
perceived
that
the
old
woman
was
robust
and
formidable
she
turned
towards
me
and
opened
her
eyes
i
could
not
see
them
monsieur
she
said
in
a
very
gentle
voice
what
do
you
want
when
about
to
speak
to
this
being
i
experienced
the
sensation
one
would
feel
in
presence
of
a
sow
to
which
it
behoved
one
to
say
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
reply
and
thought
for
a
moment
just
then
my
gaze
wandering
towards
the
window
fell
upon
a
sort
of
picture
that
hung
outside
like
a
sign
it
was
a
sign
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
picture
of
a
young
and
pretty
woman
decolletée
wearing
an
enormous
beplumed
hat
and
carrying
an
infant
in
her
arms
the
whole
in
the
style
of
the
chimney
boards
of
the
time
of
louis
xviii
above
the
picture
stood
out
this
inscription
in
big
letters

pillage
the
revolt
in
santo
domingo
i
thought
that
i
must
be
dreaming
none
who
did
not
witness
the
sight
could
form
any
idea
of
it
i
will
however
endeavour
to
depict
something
of
it
i
will
simply
recount
what
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
this
small
portion
of
a
great
scene
minutely
reproduced
will
enable
you
to
form
some
notion
as
to
the
general
aspect
of
the
town
during
the
three
days
of
pillage
multiply
these
details
and
you
will
get
the
ensemble
i
had
taken
refuge
by
the
gate
of
the
town
a
puny
barrier
made
of
long
laths
painted
yellow
nailed
to
cross
laths
and
sharpened
at
the
top
near
by
was
a
kind
of
shed
in
which
some
hapless
colonists
who
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
had
sought
shelter
they
were
silent
and
seemed
to
be
petrified
in
all
the
attitudes
of
despair
just
outside
of
the
shed
an
old
man
weeping
was
seated
on
the
trunk
of
a
mahogany
tree
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
looked
like
the
shaft
of
a
column
another
vainly
sought
to
restrain
a
white
woman
who
wild
with
fright
was
trying
to
flee
without
knowing
where
she
was
going
through
the
crowd
of
furious
ragged
howling
negroes
the
negroes
however
free
victorious
drunk
mad
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
this
miserable
forlorn
group
of
whites
a
short
distance
from
us
two
of
them
with
their
knives
between
their
teeth
were
slaughtering
an
ox
upon
which
they
were
kneeling
with
their
feet
in
its
blood
a
little
further
on
two
hideous
negresses
dressed
as
marchionesses
covered
with
ribbons
and
pompons
their
breasts
bare
and
their
heads
encumbered
with
feathers
and
laces
were
quarrelling
over
a
magnificent
dress
of
chinese
satin
which
one
of
them
had
grasped
with
her
nails
while
the
other
hung
on
to
it
with
her
teeth
at
their
feet
a
number
of
little
blacks
were
ransacking
a
broken
trunk
from
which
the
dress
had
been
taken
the
rest
was
incredible
to
see
and
impossible
to
describe
it
was
a
crowd
a
mob
a
masquerade
a
revel
a
hell
a
terrible
buffoonery
negroes
negresses
and
mulattoes
in
every
posture
in
all
manner
of
disguises
displayed
all
sorts
of
costumes
and
what
was
worse
their
nudity
here
was
a
ugly
mulatto
of
furious
mien
attired
like
the
planters
in
a
waistcoat
and
trousers
of
white
material
but
with
a
bishop
s
mitre
on
his
head
and
a
crosier
in
his
hand
elsewhere
three
or
four
negroes
with
hats
stuck
on
their
heads
and
wearing
red
or
blue
military
coats
with
the
shoulder
belts
crossed
upon
their
black
skin
were
harassing
an
unfortunate
militiaman
they
had
captured
and
who
with
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
was
being
dragged
through
the
town
with
loud
bursts
of
laughter
they
slapped
his
powdered
hair
and
pulled
his
long
pigtail
now
and
then
they
would
stop
and
force
the
prisoner
to
kneel
and
by
signs
give
him
to
understand
that
they
were
going
to
shoot
him
there
then
prodding
him
with
the
butts
of
their
rifles
they
would
make
him
get
up
again
and
go
through
the
same
performance
further
on
a
number
of
old
mulattresses
had
formed
a
ring
and
were
skipping
round
in
the
midst
of
the
mob
they
were
dressed
in
the
nattiest
costumes
of
our
youngest
and
prettiest
white
women
and
in
dancing
raised
their
skirts
so
as
to
show
their
lean
shrivelled
legs
and
yellow
thighs
nothing
queerer
could
be
imagined
than
all
these
charming
fashions
and
finery
of
the
frivolous
century
of
louis
these
watteau
shepherdess
costumes
furbelows
plumes
and
laces
upon
these
black
frightful
people
thus
decked
out
they
were
no
longer
even
negroes
and
negresses
they
were
apes
and
monkeys
add
to
all
this
a
deafening
uproar
every
mouth
that
was
not
making
a
contortion
was
emitting
yells
i
have
not
finished
you
must
accept
the
picture
complete
to
its
minutest
detail
twenty
paces
from
me
was
an
inn
a
frightful
hovel
whose
sign
was
a
wreath
of
dried
herbs
hung
upon
a
pickaxe
nothing
but
a
roof
window
and
tables
a
low
rickety
tables
negroes
and
mulattoes
were
drinking
there
intoxicating
and
besotting
themselves
and
fraternising
one
has
to
have
seen
these
things
to
depict
them
in
front
of
the
tables
of
the
drunkards
a
fairly
young
negress
was
displaying
herself
she
was
dressed
in
a
man
s
waistcoat
unbuttoned
and
a
woman
s
skirt
loosely
attached
she
wore
no
chemise
and
her
abdomen
was
bare
on
her
head
was
a
magistrate
s
wig
on
one
shoulder
she
carried
a
parasol
and
on
the
other
a
rifle
with
bayonet
fixed
a
few
whites
stark
naked
ran
about
miserably
in
the
midst
of
this
pandemonium
on
a
litter
was
being
borne
the
nude
body
of
a
stout
man
in
whose
breast
a
dagger
was
sticking
as
a
cross
is
stuck
in
the
ground
on
every
hand
were
gnomes
red
black
kneeling
sitting
squatting
heaped
together
opening
trunks
forcing
locks
trying
on
bracelets
clasping
necklaces
about
their
necks
donning
coats
or
dresses
breaking
ripping
tearing
two
blacks
were
trying
to
get
into
the
same
coat
each
had
got
an
arm
on
and
they
were
belabouring
each
other
with
their
disengaged
fists
it
was
the
second
stage
of
a
sacked
town
robbery
and
joy
had
succeeded
rage
in
a
few
corners
some
were
still
engaged
in
killing
but
the
great
majority
were
pillaging
all
were
carrying
off
their
booty
some
in
their
arms
some
in
baskets
on
their
backs
some
in
wheelbarrows
the
strangest
thing
about
it
all
was
that
in
the
midst
of
the
incredible
tumultuous
mob
an
interminable
file
of
pillagers
who
were
rich
and
fortunate
enough
to
possess
horses
and
vehicles
marched
and
deployed
in
order
and
with
the
solemn
gravity
of
a
procession
this
was
quite
a
different
kind
of
a
medley
imagine
carts
of
all
kinds
with
loads
of
every
description
a
carriage
full
of
broken
crockery
and
kitchen
utensils
with
two
or
three
and
beplumed
negroes
on
each
horse
a
big
wagon
drawn
by
oxen
and
loaded
with
bales
carefully
corded
and
packed
damask
armchairs
frying
pans
and
pitchforks
and
on
top
of
this
pyramid
a
negress
wearing
a
necklace
and
with
a
feather
stuck
in
her
hair
an
old
country
coach
drawn
by
a
single
mule
and
with
a
load
of
ten
trunks
and
ten
negroes
three
of
whom
were
upon
the
animal
s
back
mingle
with
all
this
bath
chairs
litters
and
sedan
chairs
piled
high
with
loot
of
all
kinds
precious
articles
of
furniture
with
the
most
sordid
objects
it
was
the
hut
and
the
pitched
together
into
a
cart
an
immense
removal
by
madmen
defiling
through
the
town
what
was
incomprehensible
was
the
equanimity
with
which
the
petty
robbers
regarded
the
wholesale
robbers
the
pillagers
afoot
stepped
aside
to
let
the
pillagers
in
carriages
pass
there
were
it
is
true
a
few
patrols
if
a
squad
of
five
or
six
monkeys
disguised
as
soldiers
and
each
beating
at
his
own
sweet
will
on
a
drum
can
be
called
a
patrol
near
the
gate
of
the
town
through
which
this
immense
stream
of
vehicles
was
issuing
pranced
a
mulatto
a
tall
lean
yellow
rascal
rigged
out
in
a
judge
s
gown
and
white
tie
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
his
legs
bare
he
was
digging
his
heels
into
a
horse
that
pawed
about
in
the
crowd
he
was
the
magistrate
charged
with
the
duty
of
preserving
order
at
the
gate
a
little
further
on
galloped
another
group
a
negro
in
a
red
coat
with
a
blue
sash
a
general
s
epaulettes
and
an
immense
hat
surcharged
with
feathers
was
forcing
his
way
through
the
rabble
he
was
preceded
by
a
horrible
helmetted
negro
boy
beating
upon
a
drum
and
followed
by
two
mulattoes
one
in
a
colonel
s
coat
the
other
dressed
as
a
turk
with
a
hideous
mardi
gras
turban
on
his
ugly
head
out
on
the
plain
i
could
see
battalions
of
ragged
soldiers
drawn
up
round
a
big
house
on
which
was
a
crowded
balcony
draped
with
a
flag
it
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
balcony
from
which
a
speech
was
being
delivered
beyond
these
battalions
this
balcony
this
flag
and
this
speech
was
a
calm
magnificent
green
and
charming
mountains
of
superb
shape
a
cloudless
sky
the
ocean
without
a
ripple
strange
and
sad
it
is
to
see
the
grimace
of
man
made
with
such
effrontery
in
presence
of
the
face
of
god
iii
a
dream
september
last
night
i
dreamed
this
we
had
been
talking
all
the
evening
about
riots
a
propos
of
the
troubles
in
the
rue
saint
honoré
i
entered
an
obscure
passage
way
men
passed
and
elbowed
me
in
the
shadow
i
issued
from
the
passage
i
was
in
a
large
square
which
was
longer
than
it
was
wide
and
surrounded
by
a
sort
of
vast
wall
or
high
edifice
that
resembled
a
wall
which
enclosed
it
on
all
four
sides
there
were
neither
doors
nor
windows
in
this
wall
just
a
few
holes
here
and
there
at
certain
spots
it
appeared
to
have
been
riddled
with
shot
at
others
it
was
cracked
and
hanging
over
as
though
it
had
been
shaken
by
an
earthquake
it
had
the
bare
crumbling
and
desolate
aspect
of
places
in
oriental
cities
no
one
was
in
sight
day
was
breaking
the
stone
was
grey
the
sky
also
at
the
extremity
of
the
place
i
perceived
four
obscure
objects
that
looked
liked
cannon
levelled
ready
for
firing
a
great
crowd
of
ragged
men
and
children
rushed
by
me
with
gestures
of
terror
save
us
cried
one
of
them
the
grape
shot
is
coming
where
are
we
i
asked
what
is
this
place
what
do
you
not
belong
to
paris
responded
the
man
this
is
the
i
gazed
about
me
and
in
effect
recognised
in
this
frightful
devastated
square
in
ruins
a
sort
of
spectre
of
the
the
fleeing
men
had
vanished
i
knew
not
whither
i
also
would
have
fled
i
could
not
in
the
twilight
i
saw
a
light
moving
about
the
cannon
the
square
was
deserted
i
could
hear
cries
of
run
they
are
going
to
shoot
but
i
could
not
see
those
who
uttered
them
a
woman
passed
by
she
was
in
tatters
and
carried
a
child
on
her
back
she
did
not
run
she
walked
slowly
she
was
young
cold
pale
terrible
as
she
passed
me
she
said
it
is
hard
lines
bread
is
at
sous
and
even
at
that
the
cheating
bakers
do
not
give
full
i
saw
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
square
flare
up
and
heard
the
roar
of
the
cannon
i
awoke
somebody
had
just
slammed
the
front
door
iv
the
panel
with
the
coat
of
arms
the
panel
which
was
opposite
the
bed
had
been
so
blackened
by
time
and
effaced
by
dust
that
at
first
he
could
distinguish
only
confused
lines
and
undecipherable
contours
but
the
while
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
his
eyes
continually
wandered
back
to
it
with
that
mysterious
and
mechanical
persistence
which
the
gaze
sometimes
has
singular
details
began
to
detach
themselves
from
the
confused
and
obscure
whole
his
curiosity
was
roused
when
the
attention
becomes
fixed
it
is
like
a
light
and
the
tapestry
growing
gradually
less
cloudy
finally
appeared
to
him
in
its
entirety
and
stood
out
distinctly
against
the
sombre
wall
as
though
vaguely
illumined
it
was
only
a
panel
with
a
coat
of
arms
upon
it
the
blazon
no
doubt
of
former
owners
of
the
château
but
this
blazon
was
a
strange
one
the
escutcheon
was
at
the
foot
of
the
panel
and
it
was
not
this
that
first
attracted
attention
it
was
of
the
bizarre
shape
of
german
escutcheons
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
was
perpendicular
and
rested
although
rounded
at
the
base
upon
a
worn
moss
covered
stone
of
the
two
upper
angles
one
bent
to
the
left
and
curled
back
upon
itself
like
the
turned
down
corner
of
a
page
of
an
old
book
the
other
which
curled
upward
bore
at
its
extremity
an
immense
and
magnificent
morion
in
profile
the
chinpiece
of
which
protruded
further
than
the
visor
making
the
helm
look
like
a
horrible
head
of
a
fish
the
crest
was
formed
of
two
great
spreading
wings
of
an
eagle
one
black
the
other
red
and
amid
the
feathers
of
these
wings
were
the
membranous
twisted
and
almost
living
branches
of
a
huge
seaweed
which
bore
more
resemblance
to
a
polypus
than
to
a
plume
from
the
middle
of
the
plume
rose
a
buckled
strap
which
reached
to
the
angle
of
a
rough
wooden
pitchfork
the
handle
of
which
was
stuck
in
the
ground
and
from
there
descended
to
a
hand
which
held
it
to
the
left
of
the
escutcheon
was
the
figure
of
a
woman
standing
it
was
an
enchanting
vision
she
was
tall
and
slim
and
wore
a
robe
of
brocade
which
fell
in
ample
folds
about
her
feet
a
ruff
of
many
pleats
and
a
necklace
of
large
gems
on
her
head
was
an
enormous
and
superb
turban
of
blond
hair
on
which
rested
a
crown
of
filigree
that
was
not
round
and
that
followed
all
the
undulations
of
the
hair
the
face
although
somewhat
too
round
and
large
was
exquisite
the
eyes
were
those
of
an
angel
the
mouth
was
that
of
a
virgin
but
in
those
heavenly
eyes
there
was
a
terrestrial
look
and
on
that
virginal
mouth
was
the
smile
of
a
woman
in
that
place
at
that
hour
on
that
tapestry
this
mingling
of
divine
ecstasy
and
human
voluptuousness
had
something
at
once
charming
and
awful
about
it
behind
the
woman
bending
towards
her
as
though
whispering
in
her
ear
appeared
a
man
was
he
a
man
all
that
could
be
seen
of
his
body
legs
arms
and
chest
was
as
hairy
as
the
skin
of
an
ape
his
hands
and
feet
were
crooked
like
the
claws
of
a
tiger
as
to
his
visage
nothing
more
fantastic
and
frightful
could
be
imagined
amid
a
thick
bristling
beard
a
nose
like
an
owl
s
beak
and
a
mouth
whose
corners
were
drawn
by
a
rictus
were
just
discernible
the
eyes
were
half
hidden
by
his
thick
bushy
curly
hair
each
curl
ended
in
a
spiral
pointed
and
twisted
like
a
gimlet
and
on
peering
at
them
closely
it
could
be
seen
that
each
of
these
gimlets
was
a
little
viper
the
man
was
smiling
at
the
woman
it
was
disquieting
and
sinister
the
contact
of
these
two
equally
chimerical
beings
the
one
almost
an
angel
the
other
almost
a
monster
a
revolting
clash
of
the
two
extremes
of
the
ideal
the
man
held
the
pitchfork
the
woman
grasped
the
strap
with
her
delicate
pink
fingers
as
to
the
escutcheon
itself
it
was
sable
that
is
to
say
black
and
in
the
middle
of
it
appeared
with
the
vague
whiteness
of
silver
a
fleshless
deformed
thing
which
like
the
rest
at
length
became
distinct
it
was
a
death
s
head
the
nose
was
lacking
the
orbits
of
the
eyes
were
hollow
and
deep
the
cavity
of
the
ear
could
be
seen
on
the
right
side
all
the
seams
of
the
cranium
could
be
traced
and
there
only
remained
two
teeth
in
the
jaws
but
this
black
escutcheon
this
livid
death
s
head
designed
with
such
minuteness
of
detail
that
it
seemed
to
stand
out
from
the
tapestry
was
less
lugubrious
than
the
two
personages
who
held
up
the
hideous
blazon
and
who
seemed
to
be
whispering
to
each
other
in
the
shadow
at
the
bottom
of
the
panel
in
a
corner
was
the
date
the
easter
daisy
may
a
few
days
ago
i
was
passing
along
the
rue
de
chartres
a
palisade
of
boards
which
linked
two
islands
of
high
houses
attracted
my
attention
it
threw
upon
the
pavement
a
shadow
which
the
sunshine
penetrating
between
the
badly
joined
boards
striped
with
beautiful
parallel
streaks
of
gold
such
as
one
sees
on
the
fine
black
satins
of
the
renaissance
i
strolled
over
to
it
and
peered
through
the
cracks
the
little
rue
de
chartres
was
situated
on
the
site
now
occupied
by
the
pavilion
de
rohan
it
extended
from
the
open
ground
of
the
carrousel
to
the
place
du
the
old
vaudeville
theatre
was
situated
in
it
this
palisade
encloses
the
site
on
which
was
built
the
vaudeville
theatre
that
was
destroyed
by
fire
two
years
ago
in
june
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
shone
hotly
the
street
was
deserted
a
sort
of
house
door
painted
grey
still
ornamented
with
rococo
carving
and
which
a
hundred
years
ago
probably
was
the
entrance
to
the
boudoir
of
some
little
mistress
had
been
adjusted
to
the
palisade
there
was
only
a
latch
to
raise
and
i
entered
the
enclosure
nothing
could
be
sadder
or
more
desolate
a
chalky
soil
here
and
there
blocks
of
stone
that
the
masons
had
begun
to
work
upon
but
had
abandoned
and
which
were
at
once
white
as
the
stones
of
sepulchres
and
mouldy
as
the
stones
of
ruins
no
one
in
the
enclosure
on
the
walls
of
the
neighbouring
houses
traces
of
flame
and
smoke
still
visible
however
since
the
catastrophe
two
successive
springtides
had
softened
the
ground
and
in
a
corner
of
the
trapezium
behind
an
enormous
stone
that
was
becoming
tinted
with
the
green
of
moss
and
beneath
which
were
haunts
of
woodlice
millepeds
and
other
insects
a
little
patch
of
grass
had
grown
in
the
shadow
i
sat
on
the
stone
and
bent
over
the
grass
oh
my
goodness
there
was
the
prettiest
little
easter
daisy
in
the
world
and
flitting
about
it
was
a
charming
microscopical
gnat
this
flower
of
the
fields
was
growing
peaceably
and
in
accordance
with
the
sweet
law
of
nature
in
the
open
in
the
centre
of
paris
between
a
couple
of
streets
two
paces
from
the
four
paces
from
the
carrousel
amid
omnibuses
and
the
king
s
carriages
this
wild
flower
neighbour
of
the
pavement
opened
up
a
wide
field
of
thought
who
could
have
foreseen
two
years
ago
that
a
daisy
would
be
growing
on
this
spot
if
as
on
the
ground
adjoining
there
had
never
been
anything
but
houses
that
is
to
say
proprietors
tenants
and
hail
porters
careful
residents
extinguishing
candle
and
fire
at
night
before
going
to
sleep
never
would
there
have
been
a
wild
flower
here
how
many
things
how
many
plays
that
failed
or
were
applauded
how
many
ruined
families
how
many
incidents
how
many
adventures
how
many
catastrophes
were
summed
up
in
this
flower
to
all
those
who
lived
upon
the
crowd
that
was
nightly
summoned
here
what
a
spectre
this
flower
would
have
been
had
it
appeared
to
them
two
years
ago
what
a
labyrinth
is
destiny
and
what
mysterious
combinations
there
were
that
led
up
to
the
advent
of
this
enchanting
little
yellow
sun
with
its
white
rays
it
required
a
theatre
and
a
conflagration
which
are
the
gaiety
and
the
terror
of
a
city
one
of
the
most
joyous
inventions
of
man
and
one
of
the
most
terrible
visitations
of
god
bursts
of
laughter
for
thirty
years
and
whirlwinds
of
flame
for
thirty

to
her

miroy
frédérick

the
table
he
never
invites
anybody
to
dinner
except
porcher
the
chief
of
the
claque
fredérick
and
porcher
each
other
porcher
has
common
sense
good
manners
and
plenty
of
money
which
he
lends
gallantly
to
authors
whose
rent
is
due
porcher
is
the
man
of
whom
harel
said
he
likes
protects
and
disdains

a
band
of
men
and
boys
who
are
paid
to
applaud
a
piece
or
a
certain
actor
or
actress
at
a
given
signal
the
applause
contractor
or
de
is
an
important
factor
in
french
theatrical
affairs
frédérick
has
never
less
than
fifteen
dishes
at
his
table
when
the
servant
brings
them
in
he
looks
at
them
and
judges
them
without
tasting
them
often
he
says
that
is
have
you
eaten
of
it
no
god
forbid
but
taste
it
is
i
will
taste
it
says
clarisse
it
is
execrable
i
forbid
you
to
do
but
let
me
try
take
that
dish
away
it
is
filthy
and
he
sends
for
his
cook
and
rates
her
soundly
he
is
greatly
feared
by
all
his
household
his
domestics
live
in
a
state
of
terror
at
table
if
he
does
not
speak
no
one
utters
a
word
who
would
dare
to
break
the
silence
when
he
is
mute
one
would
think
it
was
a
dinner
of
dumb
people
or
a
supper
of
trappists
except
for
the
good
cheer
he
likes
to
wind
up
the
repast
with
fish
if
there
is
turbot
he
has
it
served
after
the
creams
he
drinks
when
dining
a
bottle
and
a
half
of
bordeaux
wine
then
after
dinner
he
lights
his
cigar
and
while
smoking
drinks
two
other
bottles
of
wine
for
all
that
he
is
a
comedian
of
genius
and
a
very
good
fellow
he
is
easily
moved
to
tears
which
start
to
his
eyes
at
a
word
said
to
him
angrily
or
reproachfully
this
dates
back
to
mlle
atala
beaudouin
the
actress
who
under
the
name
of
louise
beaudouin
created
the
role
of
the
queen
in
ruy

had
left
frédérick
lemaître
the
great
and
marvellous
comedian
frédérick
adored
her
and
was
inconsolable
mlle
atala
s
mother
had
strongly
advised
her
daughter
on
this
occasion
frédérick
was
occasionally
violent
notwithstanding
that
he
was
very
amorous
and
besides
a
russian
prince
had
presented
himself
in
short
mlle
atala
persisted
in
her
determination
and
positively
refused
to
see
frederick
frederick
made
frightful
threats
especially
against
the
mother
one
morning
there
was
a
violent
ringing
at
mlle
atala
s
bell
her
mother
opened
the
door
and
recoiled
in
terror
it
was
frédérick
he
entered
dropped
into
the
chair
that
was
handiest
to
him
and
said
to
the

mademoiselle

october
mlle

she
was
sad
and
elegantly
dressed
in
a
blue
dress
with
white
stripes
she
said
i

weary
and
disgusted
i
asked
for
mars

they
granted
me
a
pension
of
two
thousand
francs
which
they
do
not
pay
just
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
even
that
i
do
not
get
a
chance
to
eat
they
wanted
to
engage
me
at
the

at
the
théâtre

i
refused
what
could
i
do
there
among
those
transparencies
a
stout
woman

where

the
authors
where
are
the
pieces
where

the
roles

tomb

is
horrible
to
see
his
name
there
on
the
stone
yet
i
did
not
weep
i
was
and
cold
what
a
strange
thing
is
life
to
think
that
this
man
who
was
so
clever
so
witty
should
die
an
idiot
he
passed
his
days
doing
like
this
with
his
fingers
not
a
spark
of
reason
remained
it
is
all
over

not
where
at
toulouse
at
carpentras
in
barns
to
earn
her
living

is
reduced
like
me
to
showing
her
bald
head
and
dragging
her
poor
old
carcass
on
badly
planed
boards
behind
footlights
of
four
tallow
candles
among
strolling
actors
who
have
been
to
the
galleys
or
who
ought
to
be
there
ah
monsieur

this
is
nothing

harel
was
manager
of
the
porte
martin
theatre
mlle
georges
lived
with
him
tableaux
vivants
in
the
year
there
was
a
spectacle
that
caused
a
furore
in
paris
it
was
that
afforded
by
women
attired
only
in
pink
tights
and
a
gauze
skirt
executing
poses
that
were
called
with
a
few
men
to
complete
the
groups
this
show
was
given
at
the
porte
saint
martin
and
at
the
cirque
i
had
the
curiosity
one
night
to
go
and
see
the
women
behind
the
scenes
i
went
to
the
porte
saint
martin
where
i
may
add
in
parentheses
they
were
going
to
revive
lucrêce
borgia
villemot
the
stage
manager
who
was
of
poor
appearance
but
intelligent
said
i
will
take
you
into
the
a
score
of
men
were
there
authors
actors
firemen
lamp
lighters
scene
shifters
who
came
went
worked
or
looked
on
and
in
the
midst
of
them
seven
or
eight
women
practically
nude
walked
about
with
an
air
of
the
most
naïve
tranquillity
the
pink
tights
that
covered
them
from
the
feet
to
the
neck
were
so
thin
and
transparent
that
one
could
see
not
only
the
toes
the
navel
and
the
breasts
but
also
the
veins
and
the
colour
of
the
least
mark
on
the
skin
on
all
parts
of
their
bodies
towards
the
abdomen
however
the
tights
became
thicker
and
only
the
form
was
distinguishable
the
men
who
assisted
them
were
similarly
arranged
all
these
people
were
english
at
intervals
of
five
minutes
the
curtain
parted
and
they
executed
a
for
this
they
were
posed
in
immobile
attitudes
upon
a
large
wooden
disc
which
revolved
upon
a
pivot
it
was
worked
by
a
child
of
fourteen
who
reclined
on
a
mattress
beneath
it
men
and
women
were
dressed
up
in
chiffons
of
gauze
or
merino
that
were
very
ugly
at
a
distance
and
very
ignoble
they
were
pink
statues
when
the
disc
had
revolved
once
and
shown
the
statues
on
every
side
to
the
public
crowded
in
the
darkened
theatre
the
curtain
closed
again
another
tableau
was
arranged
and
the
performance
recommenced
a
moment
later
two
of
these
women
were
very
pretty
one
resembled
mme
rey
who
played
the
queen
in
ruy
blas
in
it
was
this
one
who
represented
venus
she
was
admirably
shaped
another
was
more
than
pretty
she
was
handsome
and
superb
nothing
more
magnificent
could
be
seen
than
her
black
sad
eyes
her
disdainful
mouth
her
smile
at
once
bewitching
and
haughty
she
was
called
maria
i
believe
in
a
tableau
which
represented
a
slave
market
she
displayed
the
imperial
despair
and
the
stoical
dejection
of
a
nude
queen
offered
for
sale
to
the
first
bidder
her
tights
which
were
torn
at
the
hip
disclosed
her
firm
white
flesh
they
were
however
only
poor
girls
of
london
all
had
dirty
finger
nails
when
they
returned
to
the
green
room
they
laughed
as
freely
with
the
scene
shifters
as
with
the
authors
and
talked
broken
french
while
they
adjusted
all
kinds
of
frightful
rags
upon
their
charming
visages
their
smile
was
the
calm
smile
of
perfect
innocence
or
of
complete
corruption
at
the
academy
session
of
november
charles
the
academy
yielding
to
custom
has
suppressed
universally
the
double
consonant
in
verbs
where
this
consonant
supplanted
euphoniously
the
of
the
radical
i
avow
my
profound
ignorance
i
had
no
idea
that
custom
had
effected
this
suppression
and
that
the
academy
had
sanctioned
it
thus
one
should
no
longer
write
approuver
appeler
but
aprouver
apeler
victor
i
desire
to
point
out
to
hugo
that
the
alterations
of
which
he
complains
come
from
the
movement
of
the
language
which
is
nothing
else
than
decadence
m
cousin
having
addressed
a
personal
observation
to
me
i
beg
to
point
out
to
him
in
turn
that
his
opinion
is
in
my
estimation
merely
an
opinion
and
nothing
more
i
may
add
that
as
i
view
it
movement
of
the
language
and
decadence
have
nothing
in
common
nothing
could
be
more
distinct
than
these
two
things
movement
in
no
way
proves
decadence
the
language
has
been
moving
since
the
first
day
of
its
formation
can
it
be
said
to
be
deteriorating
movement
is
life
decadence
is
death
m
the
decadence
of
the
french
language
began
in
at
what
hour
if
you
please
october
this
is
what
was
told
to
me
at
s
session
salvandy
recently
dined
with
villemain
the
repast
over
they
adjourned
to
the
and
conversed
as
the
clock
struck
eight
villemain
s
three
little
daughters
entered
to
kiss
their
father
good
night
the
youngest
is
named
lucette
her
birth
cost
her
mother
her
reason
she
is
a
sweet
and
charming
child

five
years
well
lucette
dear
child
said
her
father
won
t
you

one
of
lafontaine
s
fables

here
observed
de
salvandy
is
a
little
person
who
recites
fables
and
who
one
of
these
days
will
inspire
lucette
did
not
understand
she
merely
gazed
with
her
big
wondering
eyes
at
salvandy
who
was
lolling
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
benevolent
condescension
well
he
went
on
will
you
not
recite
a
fable
for
us
the
child
required
no
urging
and
began
in
her
naïve
little
voice
her
fine
frank
sweet
eyes
still
fixed
upon
salvandy
one
easily
believes
one
s
self
to
be
somebody
in
france
during
the
run
of
ponsard

lucrece

had
the
following
dialogue

remarked
really
in

times
we
no
longer
know
how
to
make
mediocre
great
praise
of

literary
excellence
of

times
although
de

not
conscious
of

this
is
an
improvement
upon
the

a
slow
improvement
but

after

at
one
and
the
same
time
the
assembly
and
the
academy
the
salt
question
on
the
one
hand
on
the
other
the
much
smaller
question
of
two
vacant
seats
yet
i
gave
the
preference
to
the
latter
this
is
why
at
the
palais
bourbon
the
cavaignac
party
had
to
be
prevented
from
killing
the
new
cabinet
at
the
palais
mazarin
the
academy
had
to
be
prevented
from
offending
the
memory
of
chateaubriand
there
are
cases
in
which
the
dead
count
for
more
than
the
living
i
went
to
the
academy
the
academy
last
thursday
had
suddenly
decided
at
the
opening
of
the
session
at
a
time
when
nobody
had
yet
put
in
an
appearance
when
there
were
only
four
or
five
round
the
green
table
that
on
january
that
is
to
say
in
three
weeks
it
would
fill
the
two
seats
left
vacant
by
mm
de
chateaubriand
and
vatout
this
strange
alliance
i
do
not
say
of
names
but
of
words
replace
mm
de
chateaubriand
and
vatout
did
not
stop
it
for
one
minute
the
academy
is
thus
made
its
wit
and
that
wisdom
which
produces
so
many
follies
are
composed
of
extreme
lightness
combined
with
extreme
heaviness
hence
a
good
deal
of
foolishness
and
a
good
many
foolish
acts
beneath
this
lightness
however
there
was
an
intention
this
giddiness
was
fraught
with
deep
meaning
the
brave
party
that
leads
the
academy
for
there
are
parties
everywhere
even
at
the
academy
hoped
public
attention
being
directed
elsewhere
politics
absorbing
everything
to
juggle
the
seat
of
chateaubriand
with
the
seat
of
vatout
two
peas
in
the
same
goblet
in
this
way
the
astonished
public
would
turn
round
one
fine
morning
and
simply
see
de
noailles
in
chateaubriand
s
seat
a
small
matter
a
great
lord
in
the
place
of
a
great
writer
then
after
a
roar
of
laughter
everybody
would
go
about
his
business
again
distractions
would
speedily
come
thanks
to
the
veering
of
politics
and
as
to
the
academy
oh
a
duke
and
peer
the
more
in
it
a
little
more
ridicule
upon
it
what
would
that
matter
it
would
go
on
just
the
same
besides
de
noailles
is
a
considerable
personage
bearing
a
great
name
being
lofty
of
manner
enjoying
an
immense
fortune
of
certain
political
weight
under
louis
philippe
accepted
by
the
conservatives
although
or
because
a
legitimist
reading
speeches
that
were
listened
to
he
occupied
an
important
place
in
the
chamber
of
peers
which
proves
that
the
chamber
of
peers
occupied
an
unimportant
place
in
the
country
chateaubriand
who
hated
all
that
could
replace
him
and
smiled
at
all
that
could
make
him
regretted
had
had
the
kindness
to
tell
him
sometimes
by
mme
récamier
s
fireside
that
he
hoped
he
would
be
his
successor
which
prompted
de
noailles
to
dash
off
a
big
book
in
two
volumes
about
mme
de
maintenon
at
the
commencement
of
which
on
the
first
page
of
the
preface
i
was
stopped
by
a
lordly
breach
of
grammar
this
was
the
state
of
things
when
i
concluded
to
go
to
the
academy
the
session
which
was
announced
to
begin
at
two
o
clock
as
usual
opened
as
usual
at
a
quarter
past
three
and
at

at

past

the
candidacy
of
monsieur
the
duke
do
noailles
chateaubriand
was
irresistibly
acclaimed
decidedly
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
assembly
march
tuesday
i
had
arrived
early
at
noon
i
was
warming
myself
for
it
is
very
cold
and
the
ground
is
covered
with
snow
which
is
not
good
for
the
apricot
trees
guizot
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
was
saying
to

read
yesterday
in
a
single
day
mind
you
no
fewer
than
six
plays
that
i
responded
was
to
punish
you
for
not
having
seen
one
acted
in
eighteen
at
this
moment
thiers
came
up
and
the
two
men
exchanged
greetings
this
is
how
they
did
it

from

works

proposed

were
immediately
raised

the

rejected
the

i
besides
misdeeds
robberies
the
division
of

after
an
ambuscade
and
the
twilight
exploitation
of
the
barriers
of
paris
footpads
burglars
and
generally
have
another
industry
they
have
ideal
loves
this
requires
explanation
the
trade
in
negro
slaves
moves
us
and
with
good
reason
we
examine
this
social
sore
and
we
do
well
but
let
us
also
learn
to
lay
bare
another
ulcer
which
is
more
painful
perhaps
the
traffic
in
white
women
here
is
one
of
the
singular
things
connected
with
and
characteristic
of
this
poignant
disorder
of
our
civilization
every
gaol
contains
a
prisoner
who
is
known
as
the
all
kinds
of
trades
and
professions
peculiar
to
prisons
develop
behind
the
bars
there
is
the
vendor
of
the
vendor
of
scarfs
the
writer
the
advocate
the
usurer
the
and
the
barker
the
artist
takes
rank
among
these
local
and
peculiar
professions
between
the
writer
and
the
advocate
to
be
an
artist
is
it
necessary
to
know
how
to
draw
by
no
means
a
bit
of
a
bench
to
sit
upon
a
wall
to
lean
against
a
lead
pencil
a
bit
of
pasteboard
a
needle
stuck
in
a
handle
made
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
a
little
indian
ink
or
sepia
a
little
prussian
blue
and
a
little
vermilion
in
three
cracked
beechwood
spoons
this
is
all
that
is
requisite
a
knowledge
of
drawing
is
superfluous
thieves
are
as
fond
of
colouring
as
children
are
and
as
fond
of
tattooing
as
are
savages
the
artist
by
means
of
his
three
spoons
satisfies
the
first
of
these
needs
and
by
means
of
his
needle
the
second
his
remuneration
is
a
nip
of
wine
the
result
is
this
some
prisoners
say
lack
everything
or
are
simply
desirous
of
living
more
comfortably
they
combine
wait
upon
the
artist
offer
him
their
glasses
of
wine
or
their
bowls
of
soup
hand
him
a
sheet
of
paper
and
order
of
him
a
bouquet
in
the
bouquet
there
must
be
as
many
flowers
as
there
are
prisoners
in
the
group
if
there
be
three
prisoners
there
must
be
three
flowers
each
flower
bears
a
figure
or
if
preferred
a
number
which
number
is
that
of
the
prisoner
the
bouquet
when
painted
is
sent
through
the
mysterious
means
of
communication
between
the
various
prisons
that
the
police
are
powerless
to
prevent
to
saint
lazare
saint
lazare
is
the
women
s
prison
and
where
there
are
women
there
also
is
pity
the
bouquet
circulates
from
hand
to
hand
among
the
unfortunate
creatures
that
the
police
detain
administratively
at
saint
lazare
and
in
a
few
days
the
infallible
secret
post
apprises
those
who
sent
the
bouquet
that
palmyre
has
chosen
the
tuberose
that
fanny
prefers
the
azalea
and
that
seraphine
has
adopted
the
geranium
never
is
this
lugubrious
handkerchief
thrown
into
the
seraglio
without
being
picked
up
thenceforward
the
three
bandits
have
three
servants
whose
names
are
palmyre
fanny
and
seraphine
administrative
detentions
are
relatively
of
short
duration
these
women
are
released
from
prison
before
the
men
and
what
do
they
do
they
support
them
in
elegant
phraseology
they
are
providences
in
plain
language
they
are
pity
has
been
transformed
into
love
the
heart
of
woman
is
susceptible
of
such
sombre
graftings
these
women
say
i
am
they
are
married
indeed
by
whom
by
the
flower
with
whom
with
the
abyss
they
are
fiancées
of
the
unknown
enraptured
and
enthusiastic
fiancées
pale
sulamites
of
fancy
and
fog
when
the
known
is
so
odious
how
can
they
help
loving
the
unknown
in
these
nocturnal
regions
and
with
the
winds
of
dispersion
that
blow
meetings
are
almost
impossible
the
lovers
see
each
other
in
dreams
in
all
probability
the
woman
will
never
set
eyes
on
the
man
is
he
young
is
he
old
is
he
handsome
is
he
ugly
she
does
not
know
she
knows
nothing
about
him
she
adores
him
and
it
is
because
she
does
not
know
him
that
she
loves
him
idolatry
is
born
of
mystery
this
woman
drifting
aimlessly
on
life
s
tide
yearns
for
something
to
cling
to
a
tie
to
bind
her
a
duty
to
perform
the
pit
from
amid
its
scum
throws
it
to
her
she
accepts
it
and
devotes
herself
to
it
this
mysterious
bandit
transformed
into
heliotrope
or
iris
becomes
a
religion
to
her
she
espouses
him
in
the
presence
of
night
she
has
a
thousand
little
wifely
attentions
for
him
poor
for
herself
she
is
rich
for
him
she
whelms
this
manure
with
her
delicate
solicitude
she
is
faithful
to
him
with
all
the
fidelity
of
which
she
is
still
capable
the
incorruptible
emanates
from
the
corruptible
never
does
this
woman
betray
her
love
it
is
an
immaterial
pure
ethereal
love
subtile
as
the
breath
of
spring
solid
as
brass
a
flower
has
done
all
this
what
a
well
is
the
human
heart
and
how
giddy
it
makes
one
to
peer
into
it
lo
the
cloaca
of
what
is
it
thinking
of
perfume
a
prostitute
loves
a
thief
through
a
lily
what
plunger
into
human
thought
could
reach
the
bottom
of
this
who
shall
fathom
this
immense
yearning
for
flowers
that
springs
from
mud
in
the
secret
self
of
these
hapless
women
is
a
strange
equilibrium
that
consoles
and
reassures
them
a
rose
counterbalances
an
act
of
shame
hence
these
amours
based
on
and
sustained
by
illusion
this
thief
is
idolized
by
this
girl
she
has
not
seen
his
face
she
does
not
know
his
name
she
sees
him
in
visions
induced
by
the
perfume
of
jessamine
or
of
pinks
henceforward

of

purling

and

green
grass
are
associated
with
this
bandit
the
divine
smile
of
nature
penetrates
and
illumines
him
this
desperate
aspiring
to
paradise
lost
this
deformed
dream
of
the
beautiful
is
not
less
tenacious
on
the
part
of
the
man
he
turns
towards
the
woman
and
this
preoccupation
become
insensate
persists
even
when
the
dreadful
shadow
of

whosoever
witnesses
this

witnesses
the
extreme
of
human
misfortune
dark

are
these
baleful

evil
accumulated
dissolves
in
misfortune
upon
them
they
are
swept
with
blasts
of

of
trials
and
sorrows
streams
upon
dishevelled

it

it

the
blackness
of

yet
we
must
explore
this
obscurity
and
in
the
sombre
storm
the
mind
essays
a
difficult
flight
the
flight
of
a
wet
bird
as
it
were
there
is
always
a
vague
spectral
dread
in
these
low
regions
where
hell
penetrates
they
are
so
little
in
the
human
order
and
so
disproportionate
that
they
create
phantoms
it
is
hardly
surprising
therefore
that
a
legend
should
be
connected
with
this
sinister
bouquet
offered
by
bicêtre
to
la
salpêtrière
or
by
la
force
to
saint
lazare
it
is
related
at
night
in
the
cells
and
wards
after
the
keepers
have
gone
their
rounds
it
was
shortly
after
the
murder
of
the
joseph
a
bouquet
was
sent
from
la
force
to
a
woman
s
prison
saint
lazare
or
the
madelonnettes
in
this
bouquet
was
a
sprig
of
white
lilac
which
one
of
the
women
prisoners
selected
a
month
or
two
elapsed
the
woman
was
released
from
prison
she
was
extremely
enamoured
through
the
white
lilac
of
the
unknown
master
she
had
given
to
herself
she
began
to
perform
for
him
her
strange
function
of
sister
mother
and
mystic
spouse
ignorant
of
his
name
knowing
only
his
prison
number
all
her
miserable
savings
religiously
deposited
with
the
clerk
of
the
prison
went
to
this
man
in
order
the
better
to
affiance
herself
to
him
she
took
advantage
of
the
advent
of
spring
to
cull
a
sprig
of
real
lilac
in
the
fields
this
sprig
of
lilac
attached
by
a
piece
of
ribbon
to
the
head
of
his
bed
formed
a
pendant
to
a
sprig
of
consecrated
box
an
ornament
which
these
poor
desolate
alcoves
never
lack
the
lilac
withered
thus
this
woman
like
all
paris
had
heard
of
the
affair
of
the
and
of
the
two
italians
malagutti
and
ratta
arrested
for
the
murder
of
the
she
thought
little
about
the
tragedy
which
did
not
concern
her
and
lived
only
in
her
white
lilac
this
lilac
was
all
in
all
to
her
she
thought
only
of
doing
her
duty
to
it
one
bright
sunny
day
she
was
seated
in
her
room
sewing
some
garment
or
other
for
her
sorry
evening
toilet
now
and
then
she
looked
up
from
her
work
at
the
lilac
that
hung
at
the
head
of
the
bed
at
one
of
these
moments
while
her
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
sprig
of
faded
flower
the
clock
struck
four
then
she
fancied
she
saw
an
extraordinary
thing
a
sort
of
crimson
pearl
oozed
from
the
extremity
of
the
stalk
of
the
flower
grew
larger
and
dripped
on
to
the
white
sheet
of
the
bed
it
was
a
spot
of
blood
that
day
at
that
very
hour
ratta
and
malagutti
were
executed
it
was
evident
that
the
white
lilac
was
one
of
these
two
but
which
one
the
hapless
girl
became
insane
and
had
to
be
confined
in
la
salpêtrière
she
died
there
from
morn
to
night
and
from
night
to
morn
she
would
gibber
i
am
mme
thus
are
these
sombre
hearts
iv
prostitution
is
an
isis
whose
final
veil
none
has
raised
there
is
a
sphinx
in
this
gloomy
odalisk
of
the
frightful
sultan
everybody
none
has
solved
its
enigma
it
is
nakedness
masked
a
terrible
spectacle
alas
in
all
that
we
have
just
recounted
man
is
abominable
woman
is
touching
how
many
hapless
ones
have
been
driven
to
their
fall
the
abyss
is
the
friend
of
dreams
fallen
as
we
have
said
their
lamentable
hearts
have
no
other
resource
than
to
dream
what
caused
their
ruin
was
another
dream
the
dreadful
dream
of
riches
nightmare
of
glory
of
azure
and
ecstasy
which
weighs
upon
the
chest
of
the
poor
flourish
of
trumpets
heard
in
the
gehenna
with
the
triumph
of
the
fortunate
appearing
resplendent
in
the
immense
night
prodigious
overture
full
of
dawn

falls
in
showers

why
should
i
not
have
this
too
formidable
thought
this
gleam
from
the
sinister
dazzled
them
this
puff
of
the
sombre
vapour
inebriated
them
and
they
were
lost
and
they
were
rich
wealth
is
a
fatal
distant
light
woman
flies
frantically
towards
it
this
mirror
catches
this
lark
wherefore
they
have
been
rich
they
too
have
had
their
day
of
enchantment
their
minute
of
fête
their
sparkle
they
have
had
that
fever
which
is
fatal
to
modesty
they
have
drained
the
sonorous
cup
that
is
full
of
nothingness
they
have
drunk
of
the
madness
of
forgetfulness
what
a
flattering
hope
what
temptation
to
do
nothing
and
have
everything
alas
and
also
to
have
nothing
not
even
one
s
own
self
to
be
to
be
beauty
for
sale
a
woman
fallen
to
a
thing
they
have
dreamed
and
they
have
had
which
is
the
same
thing
complete
possession
being
but
a
dream

giddy
with
voluptuousness
every
pleasure
oh
how
much
better
is
the
innocence
of
those
poor
little
barefooted
ones
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
who
hear
at
nightfall
the
tinkling
of
the
cracked
bells
of
the
goats
on
the
cliffs
there
was
a
disastrous
morrow
to
these
brief
perfidious
joys
that
they
had
savoured
the
word
love
signified
hatred
the
invisible
doubles
the
visible
and
it
is
lugubrious
those
who
shared
their
raptures
those
to
whom
they
gave
all
received
all
and
accepted
nothing
they
the
fallen
ones
sowed
their
seed
in
ashes
they
were
deserted
even
as
they
were
being
embraced
abandonment
sniggered
behind
the
mask
of
the
kiss
and
now
what
are
they
to
do
they
must
perforce
continue
to
love
oh
if
they
could
the
unhappy
creatures
if
they
could
put
from
them
their
hearts
their
dreams
harden
themselves
with
a
hardness
that
could
not
be
softened
be
forever
cold
and
passionless
tear
out
their
entrails
and
since
they
are
filth
become
monsters
if
they
could
no
longer
think
if
they
could
ignore
the
flower
efface
the
star
stop
up
the
mouth
of
the
pit
close
heaven
they
would
at
least
no
longer
suffer
but
no
they
have
a
right
to
marriage
they
have
a
right
to
the
heart
they
have
a
right
to
torture
they
have
a
right
to
the
ideal
no
chilling
of
their
hearts
can
put
out
the
internal
fire
however
cold
they
may
be
they
burn
this
we
have
said
is
at
once
their
misery
and
their
crown
this
sublimeness
combines
with
their
abjection
to
overwhelm
them
and
raise
them
up
whether
they
will
or
not
the
inextinguishable
does
not
become
extinguished
illusion
is
untamable
nothing
is
more
invincible
than
dreams
and
man
is
almost
made
up
of
dreams
nature
will
not
agree
to
be
insolvable
one
must
contemplate
aspire
love
if
need
be
marble
will
set
the
example
the
statue
becomes
a
woman
rather
than
the
woman
a
statue
the
sewer
is
a
sanctuary
in
spite
of
itself
it
is
unhealthy
there
is
vitiated
air
in
it
but
the
irresistible
phenomenon
is
none
the
less
accomplished
all
the
holy
generosities
bloom
livid
in
this
cave
cynicism
and
the
secret
despair
of
pity
are
driven
back
by
ecstasy
the
magnificences
of
kindness
shine
through
infamy
this
orphan
creature
feels
herself
to
be
wife
sister
mother
and
this
fraternity
which
has
no
family
and
this
maternity
which
has
no
children
and
this
adoration
which
has
no
altar
she
casts
into
the
outer
darkness
some
one
marries
her
who
the
man
in
the
gloom
she
sees
on
her
finger
the
ring
made
of
the
mysterious
gold
of
dreams
and
she
sobs
torrents
of
tears
well
from
her
eyes
sombre
delights
and
at
the
same
time
let
us
repeat
it
she
suffers
tortures
she
does
not
belong
to
him
to
whom
she
has
given
herself
everybody
takes
her
away
again
the
brutal
public
hand
holds
the
wretched
creature
and
will
not
let
her
go
she
fain
would
flee
flee
whither
from
whom
from
you
herself
above
all
from
him
whom
she
loves
the
funereal
ideal
man
she
can
not
thus
and
these
are
extreme
afflictions
this
hapless
wight
expiates
and
her
expiation
is
brought
upon
her
by
her
grandeur
whatever
she
may
do
she
has
to
love
she
is
condemned
to
the
light
she
has
to
condole
she
has
to
succour
she
has
to
devote
herself
she
has
to
be
kind
a
woman
who
has
lost
her
modesty
fain
would
know
love
no
more
impossible
the
refluxes
of
the
heart
are
as
inevitable
as
those
of
the
sea
the
lights
of
the
heart
are
as
fixed
as
those
of
the
night
there
is
within
us
that
which
we
can
never
lose
abnegation
sacrifice
tenderness
enthusiasm
all
these
rays
turn
against
the
woman
within
her
inmost
self
and
attack
and
burn
her
all
these
virtues
remain
to
avenge
themselves
upon
her
when
she
would
have
been
a
wife
she
is
a
slave
hers
is
the
hopeless
thankless
task
of
lulling
a
brigand
in
the
blue
nebulousness
of
her
illusions
and
of
decking
mandrin
with
a
starry
rag
she
is
the
sister
of
charity
of
crime
she
loves
alas
she
endures
her
inadmissible
divinity
she
is
magnanimous
and
thrills
at
so
being
she
is
happy
with
a
horrible
happiness
she
enters
backwards
into
indignant
eden
we
do
not
sufficiently
reflect
upon
this
that
is
within
us
and
can
not
be
lost

chaos

under
the
frightful
thickness
of

composed
of
expectorations
there
where

the

is
found
even
in

at

i
the
king
ii
the
duchess
d
orleans
iii
the
princes
i
the
king
june
louis
philippe
the
king
told
me
that
talleyrand
said
to
him
one
day
you
will
never
be
able
to
do
anything
with
thiers
although
he
would
make
an
excellent
tool
he
is
one
of
those
men
one
can
not
make
use
of
unless
one
is
able
to
satisfy
them
now
he
never
will
be
satisfied
it
is
unfortunate
for
him
as
for
you
that
in
our
times
he
can
not
be
made
a
a
propos
of
the
fortifications
of
paris
the
king
told
me
how
the
emperor
napoleon
learned
the
news
of
the
taking
of
paris
by
the
allies
the
emperor
was
marching
upon
paris
at
the
head
of
his
guard
near
juvisy
at
a
place
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
where
there
is
an
obelisk
that
i
never
see
without
feeling
heavy
at
heart
remarked
the
king
a
courier
on
his
way
to
meet
napoleon
brought
him
the
news
of
the
capitulation
of
paris
paris
had
been
taken
the
enemy
had
entered
it
the
emperor
turned
pale
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
remained
thus
motionless
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
without
saying
a
word
he
turned
about
and
took
the
road
back
to
fontainebleau
general
athalin
witnessed
this
scene
and
recounted
it
to
the
king
july
a
few
days
ago
the
king
said
to
marshal
soult
in
presence
of
others
marshal
do
you
remember
the
siege
of
cadiz
rather
sire
i
should
think
so
i
swore
enough
before
that
cursed
cadiz
i
invested
the
place
and
was
forced
to
go
away
as
i
had
marshal
while
you
were
before
it
i
was
inside
i
know
the
cortes
and
the
english
cabinet
offered
me
the
command
of
the
spanish
i
remember
the
offer
was
a
grave
one
i
hesitated
long
bear
arms
against
france
for
my
family
it
is
possible
but
against
my
country
i
was
greatly
perplexed
at
this
juncture
you
asked
me
through
a
trusty
person
for
a
secret
interview
in
a
little
house
situated
on
the
cortadura
between
the
city
and
your
camp
do
you
remember
the
fact
monsieur
the
marshal
perfectly
sire
the
day
was
fixed
and
the
interview
and
i
did
not
turn
that
is
do
you
know
why
i
never
i
will
tell
you
as
i
was
preparing
to
go
to
meet
you
the
commander
of
the
english
squadron
apprised
of
the
matter
i
know
not
how
dropped
upon
me
brusquely
and
warned
me
that
i
was
about
to
fall
into
a
trap
that
cadiz
being
impregnable
they
despaired
of
seizing
me
but
that
at
the
cortadura
i
should
be
arrested
by
you
that
the
emperor
wished
to
make
of
the
duke
d
orleans
a
second
volume
of
the
duke
d
enghien
and
that
you
would
have
me
shot
immediately
there
really
added
the
king
with
a
smile
your
hand
on
your
conscience
were
you
going
to
shoot
me
the
marshal
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
replied
with
a
smile
not
less
inexpressible
than
that
of
the
king
no
sire
i
wanted
to
compromise
the
subject
of
conversation
was
changed
a
few
minutes
later
the
marshal
took
leave
of
the
king
and
the
king
as
he
watched
him
go
said
with
a
smile
to
the
person
who
heard
this
conversation
compromise
compromise
it
is
called
compromise
in
reality
he
would
have
shot
me
august
yesterday
the
king
said
to
me
one
of
my
embarrassments
at
present
in
all
this
affair
of
the
university
and
the
clergy
is
archbishop
affre
was
shot
and
killed
in
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
on
september
while
trying
to
stop
the
fighting
between
the
troops
and
insurgents
then
why
sire
said
i
did
you
appoint
him
i
made
a
mistake
i
admit
i
had
at
first
appointed
to
the
archbishopric
of
paris
the
cardinal
of
arras
de
la
tour
d
it
was
a
good
choice
i
observed
yes
good
he
is
insignificant
an
honest
old
man
of
no
account
an
fellow
he
was
much
sought
after
by
the
carlists
greatly
imposed
upon
his
whole
family
hated
me
he
was
induced
to
refuse
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
being
in
haste
i
named
affre
i
ought
to
have
been
suspicious
of
him
his
countenance
is
neither
open
nor
frank
i
took
his
underhand
air
for
a
priestly
air
i
did
wrong
and
then
you
know
it
was
in
thiers
proposed
him
to
me
and
urged
me
to
appoint
him
thiers
is
no
judge
of
archbishops
i
did
it
without
sufficient
reflection
i
ought
to
have
remembered
what
talleyrand
said
to
me
one
day
the
archbishop
of
paris
must
always
be
an
old
man
the
see
is
quieter
and
becomes
vacant
more
i
appointed
affre
who
is
young
it
was
a
mistake
however
i
will
the
chapter
of
denis
and
appoint
as
primate
of
it
the
cardinal
de
la
tour
d
auvergne
the
papal
nuncio
to
whom
i
spoke
of
my
project
just
now
laughed
heartily
at
it
and
said
the
abbé
affre
will
commit
some
folly
should
he
go
to
rome
the
pope
will
receive
him
very
badly
he
has
acted
pusillanimously
and
blunderingly
on
all
occasions
since
he
has
been
an
archbishop
an
archbishop
of
paris
who
has
any
wit
ought
always
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
king
here
and
the
pope
august
a
month
or
two
ago
the
king
went
to
dreux
it
was
the
anniversary
of
the
death
of
the
duke
d
orleans
the
king
had
chosen
this
day
to
put
the
coffins
of
his
relatives
in
the
family
vault
in
order
among
the
number
was
a
coffin
that
contained
all
the
bones
of
the
princes
of
the
house
of
orleans
that
the
duchess
d
orleans
mother
of
the
king
had
been
able
to
collect
after
the
revolution
when
the
sepulchre
was
violated
and
they
were
dispersed
the
coffin
placed
in
a
separate
vault
had
recently
been
smashed
in
by
the
fall
of
an
arch
the
debris
of
the
arch
stones
and
plaster
had
become
mingled
with
the
bones
the
king
had
the
coffin
brought
and
opened
before
him
he
was
alone
in
the
vault
with
the
chaplain
and
two
another
coffin
larger
and
stronger
had
been
prepared
the
king
himself
with
his
own
hands
took
one
after
the
other
the
bones
of
his
ancestors
from
the
broken
coffin
and
arranged
them
carefully
in
the
new
one
he
would
not
permit
any
one
else
to
touch
them
from
time
to
time
he
counted
the
skulls
and
said
this
is
monsieur
the
duke
de
penthièvre
this
is
monsieur
the
count
de
then
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
as
far
as
he
was
able
to
he
completed
each
group
of
bones
this
ceremony
lasted
from
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
until
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
without
the
king
taking
either
rest
or
nourishment
august
yesterday
the
after
having
dined
at
villemain
s
who
lives
in
a
country
house
near
neuilly
i
called
upon
the
king
the
king
was
not
in
the
salon
where
there
were
only
the
queen
madame
adelaide
and
a
few
ladies
among
them
mme
who
is
charming
there
were
many
visitors
among
others
the
duke
de
brogue
and
rossi
who
were
of
the
dinner
party
at
which
i
had
been
present
de
lesseps
who
lately
distinguished
himself
as
consul
at
barcelona
and
the
count
d
agout
i
bowed
to
the
queen
who
spoke
to
me
at
length
about
the
princess
de
joinvile
who
was
delivered
the
day
before
yesterday
and
whose
baby
arrived
on
the
very
day
the
news
of
the
bombardment
of
tangier
by
its
father
was
received
it
is
a
little
girl
the
princess
de
joinvile
passes
the
whole
day
kissing
her
and
saying
how
pretty
she
is
with
that
sweet
southern
accent
which
the
raillery
of
her
has
not
yet
caused
her
to
lose
while
i
was
talking
to
the
queen
the
duchess
d
orleans
dressed
in
black
came
in
and
sat
beside
madame
adelaide
who
said
to
her
good
evening
dear
a
moment
afterwards
guizot
in
black
wearing
a
chain
of
decorations
with
a
red
ribbon
in
his
buttonhole
and
the
badge
of
the
legion
of
honour
on
his
coat
and
looking
pale
and
grave
crossed
the
salon
i
grasped
his
hand
as
he
passed
and
he
said
i
have
sought
you
vainly
during
the
past
few
days
come
and
spend
a
day
with
me
in
the
country
we
have
a
lot
to
talk
about
i
am
at
auteuil
no
place
d
will
the
king
come
i
asked
i
do
not
think
so
he
replied
he
is
with
admiral
de
mackau
there
is
serious
news
he
will
be
occupied
all
the
then
guizot
went
away
it
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
and
i
also
was
about
to
take
my
departure
when
one
of
madame
adelaide
s
ladies
of
honour
sent
by
the
princess
came
and
told
me
that
the
king
desired
to
speak
with
me
and
requested
that
i
would
remain
i
returned
to
the
salon
which
had
become
almost
empty
a
moment
later
as
ten
o
clock
was
striking
the
king
came
in
he
wore
no
decorations
and
had
a
preoccupied
air
as
he
passed
by
he
said
to
me
wait
until
i
have
gone
my
round
we
shall
have
a
little
more
time
when
everybody
has
left
there
are
only
four
persons
here
now
and
i
have
only
four
words
to
say
to
in
truth
he
only
tarried
a
moment
with
the
prussian
ambassador
and
de
lesseps
who
had
to
communicate
to
him
a
letter
from
alexandria
relative
to
the
strange
abdication
of
the
pacha
of
egypt
everybody
took
leave
and
then
the
king
came
to
me
thrust
his
arm
in
mine
and
led
me
into
the
large
anteroom
where
he
seated
himself
and
bade
me
be
seated
upon
a
red
lounge
which
is
between
two
doors
opposite
the
fireplace
then
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
energetically
as
though
a
weight
were
being
lifted
from
his
mind
monsieur
hugo
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
all
this
is
grave
yet
it
appears
graver
than
it
really
is
but
in
politics
i
know
one
has
sometimes
to
take
as
much
into
account
that
which
appears
grave
as
that
which
is
grave
we
made
a
mistake
in
taking
this
confounded
protectorate
we
thought
we
were
doing
something
popular
for
france
and
we
have
done
something
embarrassing
for
the
world
the
popular
effect
was
mediocre
the
embarrassing
effect
is
enormous
what
did
we
want
to
hamper
ourselves
with
tahiti
the
king
pronounced
it
taëte
for
what
to
us
was
this
pinch
of
tobacco
seeds
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
what
is
the
use
of
lodging
our
honour
four
thousand
leagues
away
in
the
box
of
a
sentry
insulted
by
a
savage
and
a
madman
upon
the
whole
there
is
something
laughable
about
it
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
is
a
small
matter
and
nothing
big
will
come
of
it
sir
robert
peel
has
spoken
thoughtlessly
he
has
acted
with
schoolboy
foolishness
he
has
diminished
his
consideration
in
europe
he
is
a
serious
man
but
capable
of
committing
thoughtless
acts
then
he
does
not
know
any
languages
unless
he
be
a
genius
there
are
perforce
gaps
in
the
ideas
of
a
man
who
is
not
a
linguist
now
sir
robert
has
no
genius
would
you
believe
it
he
does
not
know
french
consequently
he
does
not
understand
anything
about
france
french
ideas
pass
before
him
like
shadows
he
is
not
malevolent
no
he
is
not
open
that
is
all
he
has
spoken
without
reflection
i
judged
him
to
be
what
he
is
forty
years
ago
it
was
too
forty
years
ago
that
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
he
was
then
a
young
man
and
secretary
of
the
earl
of
i
did
not
quite
catch
the
name
the
king
spoke
quickly
i
often
visited
that
house
i
was
then
in
england
when
i
saw
young
peel
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
go
a
long
way
but
that
he
would
stop
was
i
mistaken
there
are
englishmen
and
of
the
highest
rank
who
do
not
understand
frenchmen
a
bit
like
that
poor
duke
of
clarence
who
afterwards
was
william
iv
he
was
but
a
sailor
one
must
beware
of
the
sailor
mind
as
i
often
say
to
my
son
joinville
he
who
is
only
a
sailor
is
nothing
on
land
well
this
duke
of
clarence
used
to
say
to
me
duke
d
orleans
a
war
between
france
and
england
is
necessary
every
twenty
years
history
shows
i
would
reply
my
dear
duke
of
what
use
are
people
of
intelligence
if
they
allow
mankind
to
do
the
same
foolish
things
over
and
over
again
the
duke
of
clarence
like
peel
did
not
know
a
word
of
french
the
protectorate
of
tahiti
what
a
difference
between
these
men
and
huskisson
you
know
huskisson
who
was
killed
on
a
railway
he
was
a
masterly
man
if
you
like
he
knew
french
and
liked
france
he
had
been
my
comrade
at
the
jacobins
club
i
do
not
say
this
in
bad
part
he
understood
everything
if
there
were
in
england
now
a
man
like
him
he
and
i
would
ensure
the
peace
of
the
monsieur
hugo
we
will
do
it
without
him
i
will
do
it
alone
sir
robert
peel
will
reconsider
what
he
has
said
egad
he
said
that
does
he
even
know
why
or
how
have
you
seen
the
english
parliament
you
speak
from
your
place
standing
in
the
midst
of
your
own
party
you
are
carried
away
you
say
more
often
than
not
what
others
think
instead
of
what
you
think
yourself
there
is
a
magnetic
communication
you
are
subjected
to
it
you
rise
here
the
king
rose
and
imitated
the
gesture
of
an
orator
speaking
in
parliament
the
assembly
ferments
all
round
and
close
to
you
you
let
yourself
go
on
this
side
somebody
says
england
has
suffered
a
gross
insult
and
on
that
side
with
gross
it
is
simply
applause
that
is
sought
on
both
sides
nothing
more
but
this
is
bad
it
is
dangerous
it
is
baleful
in
france
our
tribune
which
isolates
the
orator
has
many
advantages
of
all
the
english
statesmen
i
have
known
only
one
who
was
able
to
withstand
this
influence
of
assemblies
he
was
pitt
pitt
was
a
clever
man
although
he
was
very
tall
he
had
an
air
of
awkwardness
and
spoke
hesitatingly
his
lower
jaw
weighed
a
hundredweight
hence
a
certain
slowness
which
forcibly
brought
prudence
into
his
speeches
besides
what
a
statesman
this
pitt
was
they
will
render
justice
to
him
one
of
these
days
even
in
france
pitt
and
coburg
are
still
being
harped
upon
but
it
is
a
childish
foolishness
that
will
pass
pitt
knew
french
to
carry
on
politics
properly
we
must
have
englishmen
who
know
french
and
frenchmen
who
know
english
look
here
i
am
going
to
england
next
month
i
shall
be
very
well
received
i
speak
english
and
then
englishmen
appreciate
the
fact
that
i
have
studied
them
closely
enough
not
to
detest
them
for
one
always
begins
by
detesting
the
english
this
is
an
effect
of
the
surface
i
esteem
them
and
pride
myself
upon
the
fact
between
ourselves
there
is
one
thing
i
apprehend
in
going
to
england
and
that
is
a
too
warm
welcome
i
shall
have
to
elude
an
ovation
popularity
there
would
render
me
unpopular
here
but
i
must
not
get
myself
badly
received
either
badly
received
there
taunted
here
oh
it
is
not
easy
to
move
when
one
is
louis
philippe
is
it
monsieur
hugo
however
i
will
endeavour
to
manage
it
better
than
that
big
stupid
the
emperor
of
russia
who
went
riding
full
gallop
in
search
of
a
fall
there
is
an
for
you
what
a
simpleton
he
is
nothing
but
a
russian
corporal
occupied
with
a
and
a
gaiter
button
what
an
idea
to
arrive
in
london
on
the
eve
of
the
polish
ball
do
you
think
i
would
go
to
england
on
the
eve
of
the
anniversary
of
waterloo
what
is
the
use
of
running
deliberately
into
trouble
nations
do
not
derange
their
ideas
for
us
princes
monsieur
hugo
monsieur
hugo
intelligent
princes
are
very
rare
look
at
this
pacha
of
egypt
who
had
a
bright
mind
and
who
abdicates
like
charles
who
although
he
was
not
without
genius
committed
the
same
foolish
action
look
at
this
idiotic
king
of
morocco
what
a
job
to
govern
amid
this
mob
of
bewildered
kings
they
won
t
force
me
into
committing
the
great
mistake
of
going
to
war
i
am
being
pushed
but
they
won
t
push
me
over
listen
to
this
and
remember
it
the
secret
of
maintaining
peace
is
to
look
at
everything
from
the
good
side
and
at
nothing
from
the
bad
point
of
view
oh
sir
robert
peel
is
a
singular
man
to
speak
so
wildly
he
does
not
know
all
our
strength
he
does
not
reflect
the
prince
of
prussia
made
a
very
true
remark
to
my
daughter
at
brussels
last
winter
what
we
envy
france
is
algeria
not
on
account
of
the
territory
but
on
account
of
the
war
it
is
a
great
and
rare
good
fortune
for
france
to
have
at
her
doors
a
war
that
does
not
trouble
europe
and
which
is
making
an
army
for
her
we
as
yet
have
only
review
and
parade
soldiers
when
a
collision
occurs
we
shall
only
have
soldiers
who
have
been
made
by
peace
france
thanks
to
algiers
will
have
soldiers
made
by
this
is
what
the
prince
of
prussia
said
and
it
was
true
meanwhile
we
are
making
children
too
last
month
it
was
my
daughter
of
nemours
this
month
it
is
my
daughter
of
joinville
she
has
given
me
a
princess
i
would
have
preferred
a
prince
but
pish
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
isolate
my
house
among
the
royal
houses
of
europe
future
alliances
must
be
thought
of
well
my
grandchildren
will
marry
among
themselves
this
little
one
who
was
born
yesterday
will
not
lack
cousins
nor
consequently
a
here
the
king
laughed
and
i
rose
he
had
spoken
almost
without
interruption
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
i
had
only
said
a
few
words
here
and
there
during
this
sort
of
long
monologue
madame
adelaide
passed
as
she
retired
to
her
apartments
the
king
said
to
her
i
will
join
you
directly
and
he
continued
his
conversation
with
me
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
i
quitted
the
king
it
was
during
this
conversation
that
the
king
said
to
me
have
you
ever
been
to
england
no
well
when
you
do
go
for
you
will
go
you
will
see
how
strange
it
is
it
resembles
france
in
nothing
over
there
are
order
arrangement
symmetry
cleanliness
wellmown
lawns

profound
silence

the
streets
the
are
as
serious
and
mute
as
spectres
when
being
french
and
alive
you
speak
in
the
street
these
spectres
look
back
at
you
and

with
an
inexpressible
mixture
of
gravity
and
disdain
french
people
when
i
was
in
london
i
was
walking
with
my
wife
and
sister
we
were
conversing
not
in
a
too
loud
tone
of
voice
for
we
are
persons
you
know
yet
all
the
bourgeois
and
men
of
the
people
turned
to
gaze
at
us
and
we
could
hear
them
growling

september
the
king
rose
paced
to
and
fro
for
a
few
moments
as
though
violently
agitated
then
came
and
sat
beside
me
and
said
look
here
you
made
a
remark
to
villemain
that
he
repeated
to
me
you
said
to
him
the
trouble
between
france
and
england
a
propos
of
tahiti
and
pritchard
reminds
me
of
a
quarrel
in
a
café
between
a
couple
of
one
of
whom
has
looked
at
the
other
in
a
way
the
latter
does
not
like
a
duel
to
the
death
is
the
result
but
two
great
nations
ought
not
to
act
like
a
couple
of
musketeers
besides
in
a
duel
to
the
death
between
two
nations
like
england
and
france
it
is
civilization
that
would
be
this
is
really
what
you
said
is
it
not
yes
i
was
greatly
struck
by
your
observation
and
this
very
evening
i
reproduced
it
in
a
letter
to
a
crowned
head
for
i
frequently
write
all
night
long
i
pass
many
a
night
doing
over
again
what
others
have
undone
i
do
not
say
anything
about
it
so
far
from
being
grateful
to
me
they
would
only
abuse
me
for
it
oh
yes
mine
is
hard
work
indeed
at
my
age
with
my
years
i
do
not
get
an
instant
of
real
repose
either
by
day
or
by
night
i
am
always
unquiet
and
how
can
it
be
otherwise
when
i
feel
that
i
am
the
pivot
upon
which
europe
revolves
september
the
king
said
to
me
yesterday
what
makes
the
maintenance
of
peace
so
difficult
is
that
there
are
two
things
in
europe
that
europe
detests
france
and
myself
myself
even
more
than
france
i
am
talking
to
you
in
all
frankness
they
hate
me
because
i
am
orleans
they
hate
me
because
i
am
myself
as
for
france
they
dislike
her
but
would
tolerate
her
in
other
hands
napoleon
was
a
burden
to
them
they
overthrew
him
by
egging
him
on
to
war
of
which
he
was
so
fond
i
am
a
burden
to
them
they
would
like
to
throw
me
down
by
forcing
me
to
break
that
peace
which
i
then
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
leaning
his
head
back
upon
the
cushions
of
the
sofa
remained
thus
for
a
space
pensive
and
as
though
crushed
september
i
only
met
robespierre
in
society
once
said
the
king
to
me
it
was
at
a
place
called
mignot
near
poissy
which
still
exists
it
belonged
to
a
wealthy
cloth
manufacturer
of
louviers
named
decréteau
it
was
in
or
two
decréteau
one
day
invited
me
to
dinner
at
mignot
i
went
when
the
time
came
we
took
our
places
at
table
the
other
guests
were
robespierre
and
pétion
but
i
had
never
before
seen
robespierre
mirabeau
aptly
traced
his
portrait
in
a
word
when
he
said
that
his
face
was
suggestive
of
that
of
a
cat
drinking
he
was
very
gloomy
and
hardly
spoke
when
he
did
let
drop
a
word
from
time
to
time
it
was
uttered
sourly
and
with
reluctance
he
seemed
to
be
vexed
at
having
come
and
because
i
was
there
in
the
middle
of
the
dinner
pétion
addressing
decréteau
exclaimed
my
dear
host
you
must
get
this
buck
married
he
pointed
to
robespierre
what
do
you
mean
pétion
retorted
robespierre
mean
said
pétion
why
that
you
must
get
married
i
insist
upon
marrying
you
you
are
full
of
sourness
hypochondria
gall
bad
humour
biliousness
and
atrabiliousness
i
am
fearful
of
all
this
on
our
account
what
you
want
is
a
woman
to
sweeten
this
sourness
and
transform
you
into
an
old
robespierre
tossed
his
head
and
tried
to
smile
but
only
succeeded
in
making
a
grimace
it
was
the
only
time
repeated
the
king
that
i
met
robespierre
in
society
after
that
i
saw
him
in
the
tribune
of
the
convention
he
was
wearisome
to
a
supreme
degree
spoke
slowly
heavily
and
at
length
and
was
more
sour
more
gloomy
more
bitter
than
ever
it
was
easy
to
see
that
pétion
had
not
married
september
said
the
king
to
me
last
thursday
m
guizot
has
great
qualities
and
immense
defects
queerly
enough
guizot
on
tuesday
had
made
precisely
the
same
remark
to
me
about
the
king
beginning
with
the
defects
guizot
has
in
the
highest
degree
and
i
esteem
him
for
it
profoundly
the
courage
of
his
unpopularity
among
his
adversaries
among
his
friends
he
lacks
it
he
does
not
know
how
to
quarrel
momentarily
with
his
partisans
which
was
pitt
s
great
art
in
the
affair
of
tahiti
as
in
that
of
the
right
of
search
guizot
is
not
afraid
of
the
opposition
nor
of
the
press
nor
of
the
radicals
nor
of
the
carlists
nor
of
the
legitimists
nor
of
the
hundred
thousand
howlers
in
the
hundred
thousand
public
squares
of
france
he
is
afraid
of
jacques
lefebvre
what
will
jacques
lefebvre
say
and
jacques
lefebvre
is
afraid
of
the
twelfth
arrondissement
what
will
the
twelfth
arrondissement
say
the
twelfth
arrondissement
does
not
like
the
english
we
must
stand
firm
against
the
english
but
it
does
not
like
war
we
must
give
way
to
the
english
stand
firm
and
give
way
reconcile
that
the
twelfth
arrondissement
governs
jacques
lefebvre
jacques
lefebvre
governs
guizot
a
little
more
and
the
twelfth
arrondissement
will
govern
france
i
say
to
guizot
what
are
you
afraid
of
have
a
little
pluck
have
an
but
there
they
all
stand
pale
and
motionless
and
make
no
reply
oh
fear
monsieur
hugo
it
is
a
strange
thing
this
fear
of
the
hubbub
that
will
be
raised
outside
it
seizes
upon
this
one
then
that
one
then
that
one
and
it
goes
the
round
of
the
table
i
am
not
a
minister
but
if
i
were
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
not
be
afraid
i
should
see
the
right
and
go
straight
towards
it
and
what
greater
aim
could
there
be
than
civilization

peace
twelfth
district
of
paris
the
duke
d
orleans
a
few
years
ago
recounted
to
me
that
during
the
period
which
followed
immediately
upon
the
revolution
of
july
the
king
gave
him
a
seat
at
his
council
table
the
young
prince
took
part
in
the
deliberations
of
the
ministers
one
day
merilhou
who
was
minister
of
justice
fell
asleep
while
the
king
was
speaking
chartres
said
the
king
to
his
son
wake
up
monsieur
the
keeper
of
the
the
duke
d
orleans
obeyed
he
was
seated
next
to
merilhou
and
nudged
him
gently
with
his
elbow
the
minister
was
sleeping
soundly
the
prince
recommenced
but
the
minister
slept
on
finally
the
prince
laid
his
hand
upon
merilhou
s
knee
the
minister
awoke
with
a
start
and
exclaimed
leave
off
sophie
you
are
tickling
me
this
is
how
the
word
subject
came
to
be
eliminated
from
the
preamble
of
laws
and
ordinances
dupont
de
l
eure
in
was
minister
of

on
august
the
very
day
the

took
the
oath
as

laid
before
him
a
law
to
sign
the
preamble
read
be
it
known
and
decreed
to
all
our
subjects
etc
the
clerk
who
was
instructed
to
copy
the
law
a
young
fellow
objected
to
the
word
subjects
and
did
not
copy
it
the
minister
of
justice
arrived
the
young
man
was
employed
in
his
office
well
said
the
minister
is
the
copy
ready
to
be
taken
to
the
king
for
signature
no
monsieur
the
minister
replied
the
clerk
explanations
dupont
de
l
eure
listened
then
pinching
the
young
man
s
ear
said
half
smilingly
half
angrily
nonsense
monsieur
the
republican
you
just
copy
it
at
the
clerk
hung
his
head
like
a
clerk
that
he
was
and
copied
it
dupont
however
laughingly
told
the
king
about
it
the
king
did
not
laugh
everything
appeared
to
be
a
serious
matter
at
that
time
dupin
senior
minister
without
a
portfolio
had
entered
the
council
chamber
he
avoided
the
use
of
the
word
and
got
round
the
obstacle
he
proposed
this
wording
which
was
agreed
to
and
has
always
been
used
since
be
it
known
and
decreed
to
the
state
carriage
of
louis
philippe
was
a
big
blue
coach
drawn
by
eight
horses
the
interior
was
of
gold
coloured
damask
on
the
doors
was
the
king
s
monogram
surmounted
by
a
crown
and
on
the
panels
were
royal
crowns
the
roof
was
bordered
by
eight
little
silver
crowns
there
was
a
gigantic
coachman
on
the
box
and
three
lackeys
behind
all
wore
silk
stockings
and
the
livery
of
the
d
orleans
the
king
would
enter
the
carriage
first
and
seat
himself
in
the
right
hand
corner
then
the
duke
de
nemours
would
take
his
place
beside
the

the
three
other

would
follow
and
seat
themselves

and
d
aumale
in
the
middle
the
day
the
king
attended
parliament
the
grand
deputations
from
both
houses
twelve
peers
and
deputies
chosen
by
lot
awaited
him
on
the
grand
staircase
of
the
palais
bourbon
as
the
sessions
were
nearly
always
held
in
winter
it
was
very
cold
on
the
stairs
a
biting
wind
made
all
these
old
men
shiver
and
there
are
old
generals
of
the
empire
who
did
not
die
as
the
result
of
having
been
at
austerlitz
at
friedland
at
the
cemetery
at
eylau
at
the
storming
of
the
grand
redoubt
at
moskowa
and
under
the
fire
of
the
scottish
squares
at
waterloo
but
of
having
waited
in
the
cold
upon
these
stairs
the
peers
stood
to
the
right
and
the
deputies
to
the
left
leaving
the
middle
of
the
stairs
clear
the
staircase
was
partitioned
off
with
hangings
of
white
drill
with
blue
stripes
which
was
a
poor
protection
against
draughts
where
are
the
good
and
magnificent
tapestries
of
louis
xiv
they
were
indeed
royal
wherefore
they
were
taken
down
drill
is
a
common
material
and
more
pleasing
to
the
deputies
it
charms
and
it
freezes
them
the
queen
arrived
first
with
the
princesses
but
without
the
duchess
d
orleans
who
came
separately
with
the
count
de
paris
these
ladies
walked
quickly
upstairs
bowing
to
right
and
left
without
speaking
but
graciously
followed
by
a
swarm
of
and
grim
turbaned
old
women

up

behind
chatting

laughing
anatole

came
next
in
the
much
worn
uniform
of
a
the
king
arrived
about
five
minutes
after
the
queen
he
walked
upstairs
even
more
quickly
than
she
had
done
followed
by
the
princes
running
like
schoolboys
and
bowed
to
the
peers
on
the
right
and
the
deputies
on
the
left
he
tarried
a
moment
in
the
and
exchanged
a
few
greetings
with
the
members
of
the
two
deputations
then
he
entered
the
large
hall
the
speech
from
the

written
on

sides
of
the

and
usually
filled

the

madame
the
duchess
d
orleans
is
a
rare
woman
of
great
wit
and
common
sense
i
do
not
think
that
she
is
fully
appreciated
at
the
tuileries
the
king
though
holds
her
in
high
esteem
and
often
engages
in
long
conversations
with
her
frequently
he
gives
her
his
arm
to
escort
her
from
the

to
her
apartments

act

kindly
towards

february
yesterday
the
duchess
d
orleans
said
to
me
my
son
is
not
what
one
would
call
an
amiable
child
he
is
not
one
of
those
pretty
little
prodigies
who
are
an
honour
to
their
mothers
and
of
whom
people
say
what
a
clever
child
what
wit
what
grace
he
has
a
kind
heart
i
know
he
has
wit
i
believe
but
nobody
knows
and
believes
this
save
myself
he
is
timid
wild
uncommunicative
easily
scared
what
will
he
become
i
have
no
idea
often
at
his
age
a
child
in
his
position
understands
that
he
must
make
himself
agreeable
and
little
as
he
is
sets
himself
to
play
his
role
mine
hides
himself
in
his
mother
s
skirt
and
lowers
his
eyes
but
i
love
him
just
as
he
is
i
even
prefer
him
this
way

like
a
savage
better

a

joinville
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
little
prince
had
signed
his
name
he
did
not
know
what
was
wanted
of
him
and
when
the
king
handed
him
the
certificate
and
said
paris
sign
your
name
the
child
refused
the
duchess
d
orleans
took
him
on
her
knee
and
whispered
something
to
him
then
the
child
took
the
pen
and
at
the
dictation
of
his
grandfather
wrote
upon
the
certificate
o
he
made
the
o
much
too
large
and
wrote
the
other
letters
awkwardly
and
was
very
much
embarrassed
and
shy
he
is
charming
though
and
adores
his
mother
but
he
hardly
knows
that
his
name
is
louis
philippe
d
orleans
he
writes
to
his
comrades
to
his
tutor
and
to
his
mother
but
he
signs
his
little
missives
it
is
the
only
name
he
knows
himself
by
this
evening
the
king
sent
for
regnier
the
prince
s
tutor
and
gave
him
orders
to
teach
the
count
de
paris
to
sign
his
name
the
count
de
paris
is
of
a
grave
and
sweet
disposition
he
learns
well
he
is
imbued
with
a
natural
tenderness
and
is
kind
to
those
who
suffer
his
young
cousin
of
wurtemberg
who
is
two
months
older
is
jealous
of
him
as
his
mother
the
princess
marie
was
jealous
of
the
mother
of
the
count
de
paris
during
the
lifetime
of
the
duke
d
orleans
little
wurtemberg
was
long
the
object
of
the
queen
s
preferences
and
in
the
little
court
of
the
corridors
and
bedchambers
it
was
the
custom
to
flatter
the
queen
by
comparisons
between
the
one
and
the
other
that
were
always
favourable
to
wurtemberg
that
inequality
has
ceased
the
queen
by
a
touching
sentiment
inclined
towards
little
wurtemberg
because
he
had
lost
his
mother
now
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
lean
towards
the
count
de
paris
seeing
that
he
has
lost
his
father
little
michel
ney
plays
with
the
two
princes
every
sunday
he
is
eleven
years
old
and
the
son
of
the
duke
d
elchingen
the
other
day
he
said
to
his
mother
wurtemberg
is
an
ambitious
fellow
when
we
play
he
always
wants
to
be
the
leader
besides
he
insists
upon
being
called
monseigneur
i
don
t
mind
calling
him
monseigneur
but
i
won
t
let
him
be
leader
one
day
i
invented
a
game
and
i
said
to
him
no
monseigneur
you
are
not
going
to
be
the
leader
i
will
be
leader
for
i
invented
the
game
and
chabannes
will
be
my
lieutenant
you
and
the
count
de
paris
will
be
paris
was
willing
but
wurtemberg
walked
away
he
is
an
ambitious
of
these
young
mothers
of
the
château
apart
from
the
duchess
d
orleans
mme
de
joinville
is
the
only
one
who
does
not
spoil
her
children
at
the
tuileries
everybody
even
the
king
himself
calls
her
little
daughter
the
prince
of
joinville
calls
his
wife
chicarde
since
the
pierrots
ball
hence
at
this
pierrots
ball
the
king
exclaimed
how
chicarde
is
amusing
herself
the
prince
de
joinville
danced
all
the
risquée
dances
mme
de
montpensier
and
mme
liadères
were
the
only
ones
who
were
not
decolletees
it
is
not
in
good
taste
said
the
queen
but
it
is
pretty
observed
the
king
iii
the
princes
at
the
tuileries
the
prince
de
joinville
passes
his
time
doing
all
sorts
of
wild
things
one
day
he
turned
on
all
the
taps
and
flooded
the
apartments
another
day
he
cut
all
the
bell
ropes
a
sign
that
he
is
bored
and
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
and
what
bores
these
poor
princes
most
is
to
receive
and
talk
to
people
ceremoniously
this
is
almost
a
daily
obligation
they
call
it
for
princes
have
their
slang
performing
the
the
duke
de
montpensier
is
the
only
one
who
performs
it
gracefully
one
day
the
duchess
d
orleans
asked
him
the
reason
he
replied
it
amuses
he
is
twenty
years
old
he
is
beginning
when
the
marriage
of
de
montpensier
with
the
infanta
was
published
the
king
of
the
belgians
was
sulky
with
the
tuileries
he
is
an
orleans
but
he
is
a
coburg
it
was
as
though
his
left
hand
had
smitten
his
right
cheek
the
wedding
over
while
the
young
couple
were
making
their
way
from
madrid
to
paris
king
leopold
arrived
at
saint
cloud
where
king
louis
philippe
was
staying
the
king
of
the
belgians
wore
an
air
of
coldness
and
severity
louis
philippe
after
dinner
took
him
aside
into
a
recess
of
the
queen
s
and
they
conversed
for
fully
an
hour
leopold
s
face
preserved
its
thoughtful
and
expression
however
at
the
conclusion
of
the
conversation
louis
philippe
said
to
him
see
he
is
precisely
the
man
i
do
not
want
to
see
him
urged
the
king
we
will
resume
this
conversation
when
you
have
done
the
next
day
guizot
waited
upon
king
leopold
he
had
with
him
an
enormous
portfolio
filled
with
papers
the
king
received
him
his
manner
was
cold
in
the
extreme
both
were
reserved
it
is
probable
that
guizot
communicated
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
all
the
documents
relative
to
the
marriage
and
all
the
diplomatic
papers
no
one
knows
what
passed
between
them
what
is
certain
is
that
when
guizot
left
the
king
s
room
leopold
s
air
was
gracious
though
sad
and
that
he
was
heard
to
say
to
the
minister
as
he
took
leave
of
him
i
came
here
greatly
dissatisfied
with
you
i
shall
go
away
satisfied
you
have
in
fact
in
this
affair
acquired
a
new
title
to
my
esteem
and
to
our
gratitude
i
intended
to
scold
you
i
thank
these
were
the
king
s
own
words
the
prince
de
joinville
s
deafness
increases
sometimes
it
saddens
him
sometimes
he
makes
light
of
it
one
day
he
said
to
me
speak
louder
i
am
as
deaf
as
a
on
another
occasion
he
bent
towards
me
and
said
with
a
laugh
abaisse
le
pavillion
de
l
it
is
the
only
one
your
highness
will
ever
lower
i
replied
de
joinville
is
of
somewhat
queer
disposition
now
he
is
joyous
to
the
point
of
folly
anon
gloomy
as
a
hypochondriac
he
is
silent
for
three
days
at
a
time
or
his
bursts
of
laughter
are
heard
in
the
very
attics
of
the
tuileries
when
he
is
on
a
voyage
he
rises
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
wakes
everybody
up
and
performs
his
duties
as
a
sailor
conscientiously
it
is
as
though
he
were
to
win
his
epaulettes
afterwards
he
loves
france
and
feels
all
that
touches
her
this
explains
his
fits
of
moodiness
since
he
can
not
talk
as
he
wants
to
he
keeps
his
thoughts
to
himself
and
this
sours
him
he
has
spoken
more
than
once
however
and
bravely
he
was
not
listened
to
and
he
was
not
heeded
they
needn
t
talk
about
me
he
said
to
me
one
day
it
is
they
who
are
deaf
unlike
the
late
duke
d
orleans
he
has
no
princely
coquettishness
which
is
such
a
victorious
grace
and
has
no
desire
to
appear
agreeable
he
rarely
seeks
to
please
individuals
he
loves
the
nation
the
country
his
profession
the
sea
his
manner
is
frank
he
has
a
taste
for
noisy
pleasures
a
fine
appearance
a
handsome
face
with
a
kind
heart
and
a
few
feats
of
arms
to
his
credit
that
have
been
exaggerated
he
is
popular
de
nemours
is
just
the
contrary
at
court
they
say
there
is
something
unlucky
about
the
duke
de
de
montpensier
has
the
good
sense
to
love
to
esteem
and
to
honour
profoundly
the
duchess
d
orleans
the
other
day
there
was
a
masked
and
costumed
ball
but
only
for
the
family
and
the
intimate
court
circle
the
princesses
and
ladies
of
honour
de
joinville
appeared
all
in
rags
in
complete
chicard
costume
he
was
extravagantly
gay
and
danced
a
thousand
dances
these
capers
prohibited
elsewhere
rendered
the
queen
thoughtful
wherever
did
he
learn
all
this
she
asked
and
added
what
naughty
dances
fie
then
she
murmured
how
graceful
he
is
mme
de
joinville
was
dressed
as
a
bargee
and
affected
the
manner
of
a
street
gamin
she
likes
to
go
to
those
places
that
the
court
detests
the
most
theatres
and
concerts
of
the
the
other
day
she
greatly
shocked
mme
de
hall
the
wife
of
an
admiral
who
is
a
protestant
and
puritan
by
asking
her
madame
have
you
seen
the
closerie
des
genêts
the
prince
de
joinville
had
imagined
a
nuisance
that
exasperated
the
queen
he
procured
an
old
barrel
organ
somewhere
and
would
enter
her
apartments
playing
it
and
singing
in
a
hoarse
grating
voice
the
queen
laughed
at
first
but
it
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
half
an
hour
joinville
stop
it
he
continued
to
grind
away
joinville
go
away
the
prince
driven
out
of
one
door
entered
by
another
with
his
organ
his
songs
and
his
hoarseness
finally
the
queen
fled
to
the
king
s
apartments
the
duchess
d
aumale
did
not
speak
french
very
fluently
but
as
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
italian
the
italian
of
naples
she
thrilled
like
a
fish
that
falls
back
into
the
water
and
gesticulated
with
neapolitan
verve
put
your
hands
in
your
pockets
the
duke
d
aumale
would
say
to
her
i
shall
have
to
have
your
hands
tied
why
do
you
gesticulate
like
that
i
didn
t
notice
it
the
princess
would
reply
that
is
true
she
doesn
t
notice
it
said
the
prince
to
me
one
day
you
wouldn
t
believe
it
but
my
mother
who
is
so
dignified
so
cold
so
reserved
when
she
is
speaking
french
begins
gesticulating
like
punchinello
when
by
chance
she
speaks
the
duke
de
montpensier
salutes
graciously
and
gaily
the
duke
d
aumale
does
not
salute
more
often
than
he
is
compelled
to
at
neuilly
they
say
he
is
afraid
of
ruffling
his
hair
the
duke
de
nemours
manifests
less
eagerness
than
the
duke
de
montpensier
and
less
negligence
than
the
duke
d
aumale
moreover
women
say
that
when
saluting
them
he
looks
at
them
in
a
most
embarrassing
way

said
that
lately
he
was
the
hero
of
a
love
affair
de
joinville
is
prodigiously
strong
i
heard
a
big
lackey
behind
me
say
i
shouldn
t
care
to
receive
a
slap
from
while
he
was
strolling
to
his
rendezvous
de
joinville
thought
he
noticed
that
he
was
being
followed
he
turned
back
went
up
to
the
fellow
and
struck
him
after
the
first
part
of
the
concert
mm
d
aumale
and
de
montpensier
came
into
the
other
salon
where
i
had
taken
refuge
with
théophile
gautier
and
we
chatted
for
fully
an
hour
the
two
princes
spoke
to
me
at
length
about
literary
matters
about
les
burgraves
ruy
blas
lucrèce
borgia
mme
halley
mlle
georges
and
frédérick
lemaitre
also
a
good
deal
about
spain
the
royal
wedding
and
etiquette
that
de
montpensier
the
spaniards
love
royalty
he
added
and
especially
etiquette
in
politics
as
in
religion
they
are
bigots
rather
than
believers
they
were
greatly
shocked
during
the
wedding
fetes
because
the
queen
one
day
dared
to
venture
out
afoot
mm
d
aumale
and
de
montpensier
are
charming
young
men
bright
gay
gracious
witty
sincere
full
of
that
ease
that
communicates
itself
to
others
they
have
a
fine
air
they
are
princes
they
are
perhaps
men
of
intellect
de
nemours
is
embarrassed
and
embarrassing
when
he
comes
towards
you
with
his
blond
whiskers
his
blue
eyes
his
red
sash
his
white
waistcoat
and
his
melancholy
air
he
perturbs
you
he
never
looks
you
in
the
face
he
always
casts
about
for
something
to
say
and
never
knows
what
he
does
say
november
four
years
ago
the
duke
d
aumale
was
in
barracks
at
courbevoie
with
the
of
which
he
was
then
colonel
during
the
summer
in
the
morning
after
the
manoeuvres
which
took
place
at
neuilly
he
frequently
strolled
back
along
the
river
bank
alone
his
hands
behind
his
back
nearly
every
day
he
happened
upon
a
pretty
girl
named
adele
protat
who
every
morning
went
from
courbevoie
to
neuilly
and
returned
at
the
same
hour
as
d
aumale
the
young
girl
noticed
the
young
officer
in
undress
uniform
but
was
not
aware
that
he
was
a
prince
at
length
they
struck
up
an
acquaintance
and
walked
and
chatted
together
under
the
influence
of
the
sun
the
flowers
and
the
fine
mornings
something
very
much
like
love
sprang
up
between
them
adele
protat
thought
she
had
to
do
with
a
captain
at
the
most
he
said
to
her
come
and
see
me
at
she
refused
feebly
one
evening
she
was
passing
near
neuilly
in
a
boat
two
young
men
were
bathing
she
recognized
her
officer
there
is
the
duke
d
aumale
said
the
boatman
really
said
she
and
turned
pale
the
next
day
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
she
had
seen
him
naked
and
knew
that
he
was
a
prince
in
the
chamber
of
peers
yesterday
february
i
went
to
the
chamber
of
peers
the
weather
was
fine
and
very
cold
in
spite
of
the
noonday
sun
in
the
rue
de
tournon
i
met
a
man
in
the
custody
of
two
soldiers
the
man
was
fair
pale
thin
haggard
about
thirty
years
old
he
wore
coarse
linen
trousers
his
bare
and
lacerated
feet
were
visible
in
his
sabots
and
bandages
round
his
ankles
took
the
place
of
stockings
his
short
blouse
was
soiled
with
mud
in
the
back
which
indicated
that
he
habitually
slept
on
the
ground
his
head
was
bare
his
hair
dishevelled
under
his
arm
was
a
loaf
the
people
who
surrounded
him
said
that
he
had
stolen
the
loaf
and
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
been
arrested
when
they
reached
the
gendarmerie
barracks
one
of
the
soldiers
entered
and
the
man
stayed
at
the
door
guarded
by
the
other
soldier
a
carriage
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
barracks
it
was
decorated
with
a
coat
of
arms
on
the
lanterns
was
a
ducal
coronet
two
grey
horses
were
harnessed
to
it
behind
it
were
two
lackeys
the
windows
were
raised
but
the
interior
upholstered
in
yellow
damask
was
visible
the
gaze
of
the
man
fixed
upon
this
carriage
attracted
mine
in
the
carriage
was
a
woman
in
a
pink
bonnet
and
costume
of
black
velvet
fresh
white
beautiful
dazzling
who
was
laughing
and
playing
with
a
charming
child
of
sixteen
months
buried
in
ribbons
lace
and
furs
this
woman
did
not
see
the
terrible
man
who
was
gazing
at
her
i
became
pensive
this
man
was
no
longer
a
man
for
me
he
was
the
spectre
of
misery
the
brusque
deformed
lugubrious
apparition
in
full
daylight
in
full
sunlight
of
a
revolution
that
is
still
plunged
in
darkness
but
which
is
approaching
in
former
times
the
poor
jostled
the
rich
this
spectre
encountered
the
rich
man
in
all
his
glory
but
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
they
passed
on
this
condition
of
things
could
thus
last
for
some
time
the
moment
this
man
perceives
that
this
woman
exists
while
this
woman
does
not
see
that
this
man
is
there
the
catastrophe
is
inevitable
general
fabvier
fabvier
had
fought
valiantly
in
the
wars
of
the
empire
he
fell
out
with
the
restoration
over
the
obscure
affair
of
grenoble
he
expatriated
himself
about
it
was
the
period
of
the
departure
of
the
eagles
lallemand
went
to
america
allard
and
vannova
to
india
fabvier
to
greece
the
revolution
of
broke
out
he
took
an
heroic
part
in
it
he
raised
a
corps
of
four
thousand
palikars
to
whom
he
was
not
a
chief
but
a
god
he
gave
them
civilization
and
taught
them
barbarity
he
was
rough
and
brave
above
all
of
them
and
almost
ferocious
but
with
that
grand
homeric
ferocity
one
might
have
thought
that
he
had
come
from
a
tent
of
the
camp
of
achilles
rather
than
from
the
camp
of
napoleon
he
invited
the
english
ambassador
to
dinner
at
his
bivouac
the
ambassador
found
him
seated
by
a
big
fire
at
which
a
whole
sheep
was
roasting
when
the
animal
was
cooked
and
unskewered
fabvier
placed
the
heel
of
his
bare
foot
upon
the
neck
of
the
smoking
and
bleeding
sheep
and
tore
off
a
quarter
which
he
offered
to
the
ambassador
in
bad
times
nothing
daunted
him
he
was
indifferent
alike
to
cold
heat
fatigue
and
hunger
he
never
spared
himself
the
palikars
used
to
say
when
the
soldier
eats
cooked
grass
fabvier
eats
it
i
knew
his
history
but
i
had
not
seen
him
when
in
general
fabvier
was
made
a
peer
of
france
one
day
he
had
a
speech
to
make
and
the
chancellor
announced
baron
fabvier
has
the
i
expected
to
hear
a
lion
i
thought
an
old
woman
was
speaking
yet
his
face
was
a
truly
masculine
one
heroic
and
formidable
that
one
might
have
fancied
had
been
moulded
by
the
hand
of
a
giant
and
which
seemed
to
have
preserved
a
savage
and
terrible
grimace
what
was
so
strange
was
the
gentle
slow
grave
contained
caressing
voice
that
was
allied
to
this
magnificent
ferocity
a
child
s
voice
issued
from
this
tiger
s
mouth
general
fabvier
delivered
from
the
tribune
speeches
learned
by
heart
graceful
flowery
full
of
allusions
to
the
woods
and
country
veritable
idylls
in
the
tribune
this
ajax
became
a
némorin
he
spoke
in
low
tones
like
a
diplomat
he
smiled
like
a
courtier
he
was
not
averse
to
making
himself
agreeable
to
princes
this
is
what
the
peerage
had
done
for
him
he
was
only
a
hero
after
all
august
the
marquis
de
boissy
has
assurance
coolness
a
voice
that
is
peculiar
to
himself
facility
of
speech
wit
occasionally
the
quality
of
imperturbability
all
the
accessories
of
a
great
orator
the
only
thing
he
lacks
is
talent
he
wearies
the
chamber
wherefore
the
ministers
do
not
consider
themselves
bound
to
answer
him
he
talks
as
long
as
everybody
keeps
quiet
he
fences
with
the
chancellor
as
with
his
particular
enemy
yesterday
after
the
session
which
boissy
had
entirely
occupied
with
a
very
poor
speech
guizot
said
to
me
it
is
an
affliction
the
chamber
of
deputies
would
not
stand
him
for
ten
minutes
after
the
first
two
times
the
chamber
of
peers
extends
its
high
politeness
to
him
and
it
does
wrong
boissy
will
not
be
suppressed
until
the
day
the
whole
chamber
rises
and
walks
out
when
he
asks
permission
to
you
can
not
think
of
such
a
thing
said
i
only
he
and
the
chancellor
would
be
left
it
would
be
a
duel
without
it
is
the
custom
of
the
chamber
of
peers
never
to
repeat
in
its
reply
to
the
speech
from
the
throne
the
titles
that
the
king
gives
to
his
children
it
is
also
the
custom
never
to
give
the
princes
the
title
of
royal
highness
when
speaking
of
them
to
the
king
there
is
no
highness
in
presence
of
his
majesty
january
the
address
in
reply
to
the
speech
from
the
throne
was
debated
occasionally
there
are
flashes
of
keen
and
happy
wit
in
de
boissy
s
nonsense
he
remarked
i
am
not
of
those
who
are
grateful
to
the
government
for
the
blessings
of
as
usual
he
quarrelled
with
the
chancellor
he
was
making
some
more
than
usually
roving
excursion
from
the
straight
path
the
chamber
murmured
and
cried
confine
yourself
to
the
the
chancellor
rose
monsieur
the
marquis
de
boissy
he
said
the
chamber
requests
that
you
will
confine
yourself
to
the
question
under
discussion
it
has
saved
me
the
trouble
of
asking
you
to
do
our
colleague
might
as
well
have
said
spared
me
i
whispered
to
lebrun
i
am
delighted
on
your
account
monsieur
the
chancellor
replied
de
boissy
and
the
chamber
laughed
a
few
minutes
later
however
the
chancellor
took
his
revenge
de
boissy
had
floundered
into
some
quibble
about
the
rules
it
was
late
the
chamber
was
becoming
impatient
had
you
not
raised
an
unnecessary
incident
observed
the
chancellor
you
would
have
finished
your
speech
a
long
time
ago
to
your
own
satisfaction
and
that
of
everybody
whereat
everybody
laughed
don
t
laugh
exclaimed
the
duke
de
mortemart
laughter
diminishes
the
prestige
of
a
constituted
de
pontécoulant
said
m
de
boissy
teases
monsieur
the
chancellor
monsieur
the
chancellor
torments
de
boissy
there
is
a
lack
of
dignity
on
both
sides
during
the
session
the
duke
de
mortemart
came
to
my
bench
and
we
spoke
about
the
emperor
de
mortemart
went
through
all
the
great
wars
he
speaks
nobly
of
him
he
was
one
of
the
emperor
s
orderlies
in
the
campaign
of
it
was
during
that
campaign
that
i
learned
to
know
the
emperor
he
said
i
was
near
him
night
and
day
i
saw
him
shave
himself
in
the
morning
sponge
his
chin
pull
on
his
boots
pinch
his
valet
s
ear
chat
with
the
grenadier
mounting
guard
over
his
tent
laugh
gossip
make
trivial
remarks
and
amid
all
this
issue
orders
trace
plans
interrogate
prisoners
decree
determine
decide
in
a
sovereign
manner
simply
unerringly
in
a
few
minutes
without
missing
anything
without
losing
a
useful
detail
or
a
second
of
necessary
time
in
this
intimate
and
familiar
life
of
the
bivouac
flashes
of
his
intellect
were
seen
every
moment
you
can
believe
me
when
i
say
that
he
belied
the
proverb
no
man
is
great
in
the
eyes
of
his
monsieur
the
duke
said
i
that
proverb
is
wrong
every
great
man
is
a
great
man
in
the
eyes
of
his
at
this
session
the
duke
d
aumale
having
attained
his
birthday
took
his
seat
for
the
first
time
the
duke
de
nemours
and
the
prince
de
joinville
were
seated
near
him
in
their
usual
places
behind
the
ministerial
bench
they
were
not
among
those
who
laughed
the
least
the
duke
de
nemours
being
the
youngest
member
of
his
committee
fulfilled
the
functions
of
secretary
as
is
customary
de
montalembert
wanted
to
spare
him
the
trouble
no
said
the
prince
it
is
my
he
took
the
urn
and
as
secretary
went
the
round
of
the
table
to
collect
the
votes
at
the
close
of
the
session
of
january
at
which
the
chamber
of
peers
discussed
cracow
and
kept
silent
concerning
the
frontier
of
the
rhine
i
descended
the
grand
staircase
of
the
chamber
in
company
with
de
chastellux
decazes
stopped
me
and
asked
well
what
have
you
been
doing
during
the
session
i
have
been
writing
to
mme
i
held
the
letter
in
my
hand
what
a
fine
disdain
why
did
you
not
speak
on
account
of
the
old
proverb
he
whose
opinion
is
not
shared
by
anybody
else
should
think
and
say
did
your
opinion
then
differ
from
that
of
the
others
yes
from
that
of
the
whole
what
did
you
want
then
the
whew
the
devil
i
should
have
protested
and
spoken
without
finding
any
echo
to
my
words
i
preferred
to
say
ah
the
rhine
to
have
the
rhine
yes
that
is
a
fine
idea
poetry
poetry
poetry
that
our
fathers
made
with
cannon
and
that
we
shall
make
again
with
ideas
my
dear
colleague
went
on
decazes
we
must
wait
i
too
want
the
rhine
thirty
years
ago
i
said
to
louis
xviii
sire
i
should
be
inconsolable
if
i
thought
i
should
die
without
seeing
france
mistress
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
but
before
we
can
talk
about
that
before
we
can
think
of
it
even
we
must
beget
well
i
replied
that
was
thirty
years
ago
we
have
begotten
the
april
the
chamber
of
peers
is
discussing
a
pretty
bad
bill
on
substitutions
for
army
service
the
principal
article
of
the
measure
was
before
the
house
de
nemours
was
present
there
are
eighty
in
the
chamber
the
majority
considered
the
article
to
be
a
bad
one
under
the
eye
of
the
duke
de
nemours
who
seemed
to
be
counting
them
all
rose
to
vote
in
favour
of
it
the
magistrates
the
members
of
the
institute
and
the
ambassadors
voted
against
it
i
remarked
to
president
who
was
seated
next
to
me
it
is
a
struggle
between
civil
courage
and
military
the
article
was
adopted
june
the
affair
was
before
the
chamber
of
peers
acquittal
the
vote
was
taken
by
means
of
balls
white
ones
for
condemnation
black
ones
for
acquittal
there
were
votes
cast
white
black
in
placing
my
black
ball
in
the
urn
i
remarked
in
blackening
him
we
whiten
emile
de
girardin
had
been
prosecuted
for
publishing
an
article
in
a
newspaper
violently
attacking
the
government
i
said
to
mme
d
why
do
not
the
minister
and
girardin
provoke
a
trial
in
the
assize
court
she
replied
because
girardin
does
not
feel
himself
strong
enough
and
the
minister
does
not
feel
himself
pure
mm
de
montalivet
and
mole
and
the
peers
of
the
château
voted
queerly
enough
for
girardin
against
the
government
guizot
learned
the
result
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
looked
exceedingly
wrath
june
on
arriving
at
the
chamber
i
found
greatly
scandalised
in
his
hand
was
a
prospectus
for
champagne
signed
by
the
count
de
mareuil
and
stamped
with
a
peer
s
mantle
and
a
count
s
coronet
with
the
de
mareuil
arms
he
had
shown
it
to
the
chancellor
who
had
replied
i
can
do
nothing
i
could
do
something
though
if
a
mere
councillor
were
to
do
a
thing
like
that
in
my
court
said
to
me
i
would
call
the
chambers
together
and
have
him
admonished
in
a
disciplinary
discussion
by
the
committees
of
the
chamber
of
peers
of
the
address
in
reply
to
the
speech
from
the
throne
i
was
a
member
of
the
fourth
committee
among
other
changes
i
demanded
this
there
was
our
princes
your
children
are
doing
in
africa
the
duties
of
servants
of
the
i
proposed
the
princes
your
children
are
doing
their
duty
as
servants
of
the
this
fooling
produced
the
effect
of
a
fierce
opposition
january
the
chamber
of
peers
prevented
from
pronouncing
in
the
tribune
even
the
name
of
the
convention
there
was
a

upon

with
and

order
and
he
was
compelled
almost
by
force
to
descend
from
the
tribune
i
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
to
them
you
are
imitating
a
session
of
the
convention
but
only
with
wooden
knives
i
was
restrained
by
the
thought
that
this
uttered
during
their
anger
would
never
be
forgiven
for
myself
i
care
little
but
it
might
affect
the
calm
truths
which
i
may
have
to
tell
them
and
get
them
to
accept
later
on

the

the
as
i
arrived
at
the
chamber
of
peers
it
was
o
clock
precisely
general
rapatel
came
out
of
the
and
said
the
session
is
i
went
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
as
my
cab
turned
into
the
rue
de
lille
a
serried
and
interminable
column
of
men
in
in
blouses
and
wearing
caps
and
marching
three
by
three
debouched
from
the
rue
bellechasse
and
headed
for
the
chamber
the
other
extremity
of
the
street
i
could
see
was
blocked
by
deep
rows
of
infantry
of
the
line
with
their
rifles
on
their
arms
i
drove
on
ahead
of
the
men
in
blouses
with
whom
many
women
had
mingled
and
who
were
shouting
hurrah
for
reform
hurrah
for
the
line
down
with
guizot
they
stopped
when
they
arrived
within
of
the
infantry
the
soldiers
opened
their
ranks
to
let
me
through
they
were
talking
and
laughing
a
very
young
man
was
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
did
not
go
any
further
than
the
lobby
it
was
filled
with
busy
and
uneasy
groups
in
one
corner
were
thiers
de
rémusat
vivien
and
merruau
of
the
constitutionnel
in
another
emile
de
girardin
d
and
de
boissy
d
houdetot
de
lagrenée
armand
marrast
was
talking
aside
with
d
alton
de
girardin
stopped
me
then
mm
d
houdetot
and
lagrenée
mm
and
vignier
joined
us
we
talked
i
said
to
them
the
cabinet
is
gravely
culpable
it
forgot
that
in
times
like
ours
there
are
precipices
right
and
left
and
that
it
does
not
do
to
govern
too
near
to
the
edge
it
says
to
itself
it
is
only
a
riot
and
it
almost
rejoices
at
the
outbreak
it
believes
it
has
been
strengthened
by
it
yesterday
it
fell
it
is
up
again
but
in
the
first
place
who
can
tell
what
the
end
of
a
riot
will
be
riots
it
is
true
strengthen
the
hands
of
cabinets
but
revolutions
overthrow
dynasties
and
what
an
imprudent
game
in
which
the
dynasty
is
risked
to
save
the
ministry
the
tension
of
the
situation
draws
the
knot
tighter
and
now
it
is
impossible
to
undo
it
the
hawser
may
break
and
then
everything
will
go
adrift
the
left
has
manoeuvred
imprudently
and
the
cabinet
wildly
both
sides
are
responsible
but
what
madness
possesses
the
cabinet
to
mix
a
police
question
with
a
question
of
liberty
and
oppose
the
spirit
of
chicanery
to
the
spirit
of
revolution
it
is
like
sending
with
stamped
paper
to
serve
upon
a
lion
the
quibbles
of
hébert
in
presence
of
a
riot
what
do
they
amount
to
as
i
was
saying
this
a
deputy
passed
us
and
said
the
ministry
of
marine
has
been
let
us
go
and
see
said
franc
d
houdetot
to
me
we
went
out
we
passed
through
a
regiment
of
infantry
that
was
guarding
the
head
of
the
pont
de
la
concorde
another
regiment
barred
the
other
end
of
it
on
the
place
louis
xv
cavalry
was
charging
sombre
and
immobile
groups
which
at
the
approach
of
the
soldiers
fled
like
swarms
of
bees
nobody
was
on
the
bridge
except
a
general
in
uniform
and
on
horseback
with
the
cross
of
a
commander
of
the
legion
of
honour
hung
round
his
neck
general
prévot
as
he
galloped
past
us
he
shouted
they
are
attacking
as
we
reached
the
troops
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
a
battalion
chief
mounted
in
a
bernouse
with
gold
stripes
on
it
a
stout
man
with
a
kind
and
brave
face
saluted
d
houdetot
has
anything
happened
franc
asked
it
happened
that
i
got
here
just
in
time
replied
the
major
it
was
this
battalion
chief
who
cleared
the
palace
of
the
chamber
which
the
rioters
had
invaded
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
we
walked
on
to
the
place
charging
cavalry
was
whirling
around
us
at
the
angle
of
the
bridge
a
dragoon
raised
his
sword
against
a
man
in
a
blouse
i
do
not
think
he
struck
him
besides
the
ministry
of
marine
had
not
been
a
crowd
had
thrown
a
stone
at
one
of
the
windows
smashing
it
and
hurting
a
man
who
was
peeping
out
nothing
more
we
could
see
a
number
of
vehicles
lined
up
like
a
barricade
in
the
broad
avenue
of
the
at
the
they
are
firing
yonder
said
d
houdetot
can
you
see
the
smoke
pooh
i
replied
it
is
the
mist
of
the
fountain
that
fire
is
and
we
burst
into
a
laugh
an
engagement
was
going
on
there
however
the
people
had
constructed
three
barricades
with
chairs
the
guard
at
the
main
square
of
the
had
turned
out
to
pull
the
barricades
down
the
people
had
driven
the
soldiers
back
to
the
with
volleys
of
stones
general
prévot
had
sent
a
squad
of
municipal
guards
to
the
relief
of
the
soldiers
the
squad
had
been
surrounded
and
compelled
to
seek
refuge
in
the
with
the
others
the
crowd
had
hemmed
in
the
a
man
had
procured
a
ladder
mounted
to
the
roof
pulled
down
the
flag
torn
it
up
and
thrown
it
to
the
people
a
battalion
had
to
be
sent
to
deliver
the
guard
whew
said
franc
d
houdetot
to
general
prévot
who
had
recounted
this
to
us
a
flag
taken
taken
no
stolen
yes
answered
the
general
quickly
came
up
with
napoleon
duchatel
both
were
in
high
spirits
they
lighted
their
cigars
from
franc
d
houdetot
s
cigar
and
said
do
you
know
genoude
is
going
to
bring
in
an
impeachment
on
his
own
account
they
would
not
allow
him
to
sign
the
left
s
impeachment
he
would
not
be
beaten
and
now
the
ministry
is
between
two
fires
on
the
left
the
entire
left
on
the
right
de
napoleon
duchâtel
added
they
say
that
duvergier
de
hauranne
has
been
carried
about
in
triumph
on
the
shoulders
of
the
we
had
returned
to
the
bridge
vivien
was
crossing
and
came
up
to
us
with
his
big
old
hat
and
his
coat
buttoned
up
to
his
cravat
the
of
justice
looked
like
a
policeman
where
are
you
going
he
said
to
me
what
is
happening
is
very
serious
certainly
at
this
moment
one
feels
that
the
whole
constitutional
machine
is
rocking
it
no
longer
rests
squarely
on
the
ground
it
is
out
of
plumb
one
can
hear
it
cracking
the
crisis
is
complicated
by
the
disturbed
condition
of
the
whole
of
europe
the
king
nevertheless
is
very
calm
and
even
cheerful
but
this
game
must
not
be
played
too
far
every
rubber
won
serves
but
to
make
up
the
total
of
the
rubber
lost
vivien
recounted
to
us
that
the
king
had
thrown
an
electoral
reform
bill
into
his
drawer
saying
as
he
did
so
that
is
for
my
successor
that
was
louis
s
added
vivien
supposing
reform
should
prove
to
be
the
it
appears
to
be
true
that
the
king
interrupted
salandrouze
when
he
was
laying
before
him
the
grievances
of
the
progressists
and
asked
him
brusquely
are
you
selling
many
carpets
salandrouze
was
a
manufacturer
of
carpets
at
this
same
reception
of
the
progressists
the
king
noticed
blanqui
and
graciously
going
up
to
him
asked
well
monsieur
blanqui
what
do
people
talk
about
what
is
going
on
sire
replied
blanqui
i
ought
to
tell
the
king
that
in
the
departments
and
especially
at
bordeaux
there
is
a
great
deal
of
ah
interrupted
the
king
more
agitation
and
he
turned
his
back
upon
blanqui
while
we
were
talking
vivien
exclaimed
listen
i
fancy
i
can
hear
firing
a
young
staff
officer
addressing
general
d
houdetot
with
a
smile
asked
are
we
going
to
stay
here
long
why
said
franc
d
houdetot
well
i
am
invited
out
to
dinner
said
the
officer
at
this
moment
a
group
of
women
in
mourning
and
children
dressed
in
black
passed
rapidly
along
the
other
pavement
of
the
bridge
a
man
held
the
eldest
child
by
the
hand
i
looked
at
him
and
recognized
the
duke
de
montebello
hello
exclaimed
d
houdetot
the
minister
of
marine
and
he
ran
over
and
conversed
for
a
moment
with
de
montebello
the
duchess
had
become
frightened
and
the
whole
family
was
taking
refuge
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
vivien
and
i
returned
to
the
palace
of
the
chamber
d
houdetot
quitted
us
in
an
instant
we
were
surrounded
said
boissy
to
me
you
were
not
at
the
luxembourg
i
tried
to
speak
upon
the
situation
in
paris
i
was
hooted
at
the
the
capital
in
danger
i
was
interrupted
and
the
chancellor
who
had
come
to
preside
expressly
for
that
purpose
called
me
to
order
and
do
you
know
what
general
gourgaud
said
to
me
monsieur
de
boissy
i
have
sixty
guns
with
their
caissons
filled
with
i
filled
them
i
replied
general
i
am
delighted
to
know
what
is
really
thought
at
the
château
about
the
at
this
moment
durvergier
de
hauranne
hatless
his
hair
dishevelled
and
looking
pale
but
pleased
passed
by
and
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
me
i
left
duvergier
and
entered
the
chamber
a
bill
relative
to
the
privileges
of
the
bank
of
bordeaux
was
being
debated
a
man
who
was
talking
through
his
nose
occupied
the
tribune
and
sauzet
was
reading
the
articles
of
the
bill
with
a
sleepy
air
de
belleyme
who
was
coming
out
shook
hands
with
me
and
exclaimed
alas
several
deputies
came
up
to
me
among
them
marie
roger
of
loiret
de
rémusat
and
chambolle
i
related
to
them
the
incident
of
the
tearing
down
of
the
flag
which
was
serious
in
view
of
the
audacity
of
the
attack
what
is
even
more
serious
said
one
of
them
is
that
there
is
something
very
bad
behind
all
this
during
the
night
the
doors
of
more
than
fifteen
mansions
were
marked
with
a
cross
among
the
marked
houses
being
those
of
the
princess
de
liéven
in
the
rue
saint
florentin
and
of
mme
de
are
you
sure
of
this
i
asked
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
the
cross
upon
the
door
of
mme
de
liéven
s
house
he
replied
president
met
duchâtel
this
morning
and
said
well
how
goes
it
all
is
well
answered
the
minister
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
riot
i
am
going
to
let
the
rioters
alone
at
the
rendezvous
they
arranged
for
themselves
what
can
they
do
in
the
place
louis
xv
and
the
it
is
raining
they
will
tramp
about
there
all
day
they
will
be
tired
out
and
will
go
home
to
etienne
arago
entered
hastily
at
this
juncture
and
said
there
are
seven
wounded
and
two
killed
already
barricades
have
been
erected
in
the
rue
beaubourg
and
in
the
rue
saint
after
a
suspension
of
the
session
guizot
arrived
he
ascended
the
tribune
and
announced
that
the
king
had
summoned
mole
to
charge
him
with
the
formation
of
a
new
cabinet
triumphant
shouts
from
the
opposition
shouts
of
rage
from
the
majority
the
session
ended
amid
an
indescribable
uproar
i
went
out
with
the
deputies
and
returned
by
way
of
the
quays
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
cavalry
continued
to
charge
an
attempt
to
erect
two
barricades
had
been
made
in
the
rue
saint
honoré
the
in
the
marché
saint
honoré
were
being
torn
up
the
overturned
of
which
the
barricades
had
been
made
had
been
righted
by
the
troops
in
the
rue
saint
honoré
the
crowd
let
the
municipal
guards
go
by
and
then
stoned
them
in
the
back
a
multitude
was
swarming
along
the
quays
like
irritated
ants
a
very
pretty
woman
in
a
green
velvet
hat
and
a
large
cashmere
shawl
passed
by
amid
a
group
of
men
wearing
blouses
and
with
bared
arms
she
had
raised
her
skirt
very
high
on
account
of
the
mud
with
which
she
was
much
spattered
for
it
was
raining
every
minute
the
tuileries
were
closed
at
the
carrousel
gates
the
crowd
had
stopped
and
was
gazing
through
the
arcades
at
the
cavalry
lined
up
in
battle
array
in
front
of
the
palace
near
the
carrousel
bridge
i
met
jules
sandeau
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
he
queried
that
the
riot
will
be
suppressed
but
that
the
revolution
will
on
the
quai
de
la
ferraille
i
happened
upon
somebody
else
i
knew
coming
towards
me
was
a
man
covered
with
mud
to
the
neck
his
cravat
hanging
down
and
his
hat
battered
i
recognized
my
excellent
friend
antony
thouret
thouret
is
an
ardent
republican
he
had
been
walking
and
since
early
morning
going
from
quarter
to
quarter
and
from
group
to
group
tell
me
now
what
you
really
want
said
i
is
it
the
republic
oh
no
not
this
time
not
yet
he
answered
what
we
want
is
reform
no
half
measures
oh
dear
no
that
won
t
do
at
all
we
want
complete
reform
do
you
hear
and
why
not
universal
suffrage
that
s
the
style
i
said
as
we
shook
hands
patrols
were
marching
up
and
down
the
quay
while
the
crowd
shouted
hurrah
for
the
line
the
shops
were
closed
and
the
windows
of
the
houses
open
in
the
place
du
châtelet
i
heard
a
man
say
to
a
group
it
is
over
again
i
passed
by
the
hotel
de
ville
and
along
the
rue
saint
avoye
at
the
hotel
de
ville
all
was
quiet
two
national
guards
were
walking
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
gate
and
there
were
no
barricades
in
the
rue
saint
avoye
in
the
rue
rambuteau
a
few
national
guards
in
uniform
and
wearing
their
side
arms
came
and
went
in
the
temple
quarter
they
were
beating
to
arms
up
to
the
present
the
powers
that
be
have
made
a
show
of
doing
without
the
national
guard
this
is
perhaps
prudent
a
force
of
national
guards
was
to
have
taken
a
hand
this
morning
the
guard
on
duty
at
the
chamber
refused
to
obey
orders
it
is
said
that
a
national
guardsman
of
the
legion
was
killed
just
now
while
interposing
between
the
people
and
the
troops
the
mole
ministry
assuredly
is
not
a
reform
one
but
the
guizot
ministry
had
been
for
so
long
an
obstacle
to
reform
its
resistance
was
broken
this
was
sufficient
to
pacify
and
content
the
heart
of
the
generous
people
in
the
evening
paris
gave
itself
up
to
rejoicing
the
population
turned
out
into
the
streets
everywhere
was
heard
the
popular
refrain
lampioms
des
larnpioms
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
town
was
illuminated
as
though
for
a
fête
in
the
place
royale
in
front
of
the
mairie
a
few
yards
from
my
house
a
crowd
had
gathered
that
every
moment
was
becoming
denser
and
noisier
the
officers
and
national
guards
in
the
there
in
order
to
get
them
away
from
the
maine
shouted
on
to
the
bastille
and
marching
placed
themselves
at
the
head
of
a
column
which
fell
in
joyously
behind
them
and
started
off
shouting
on
to
the
bastille
the
procession
marched
hat
in
hand
round
the
column
of
july
to
the
shout
of
hurrah
for
reform
saluted
the
troops
massed
in
the
place
with
the
cry
of
hurrah
for
the
line
and
went
off
down
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
an
hour
later
the
procession
returned
with
its
ranks
greatly
swelled
and
bearing
torches
and
flags
and
made
its
way
to
the
grand
boulevards
with
the
intention
of
going
home
by
way
of
the
quays
so
that
the
whole
town
might
witness
the
celebration
of
its
victory
midnight
is
striking
the
appearance
of
the
streets
has
changed
the
marais
quarter
is
lugubrious
i
have
just
returned
from
a
stroll
there
the
street
lamps
are
broken
and
extinguished
on
the
boulevard
bourdon
so
well
named
the
dark
the
only
shops
open
were
those
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
the
beaumarchais
theatre
was
closed
the
place
royale
is
guarded
like
a
place
of
arms
troops
are
in
ambush
in
the
arcades
in
the
rue
saint
louis
a
battalion
is
leaning
silently
against
the
walls
in
the
shadow
just
now
as
the
clock
struck
the
hour
we
went
on
to
the
balcony
listening
and
saying
it
is
the
tocsin
i
could
not
have
slept
in
a
bed
i
passed
the
night
in
my
writing
thinking
and
listening
now
and
then
i
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
strained
my
ears
to
listen
then
i
entered
the
room
again
and
paced
to
and
fro
or
dropped
into
an
and
dozed
but
my
slumber
was
agitated
by
feverish
dreams
i
dreamed
that
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
angry
crowds
and
the
report
of
distant
firing
the
tocsin
was
clanging
from
the
church
towers
i
awoke
it
was
the
tocsin
the
reality
was
more
horrible
than
the
dream
this
crowd
that
i
had
seen
marching
and
singing
so
gaily
on
the
boulevards
had
at
first
continued
its
pacific
way
without
let
or
hindrance
the
infantry
regiments
the
artillery
and
cuirassiers
had
everywhere
opened
their
ranks
to
let
the
procession
pass
through
but
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
a
mass
of
troops
infantry
and
cavalry
who
were
guarding
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
and
its
unpopular
minister
guizot
blocked
the
thoroughfare
in
front
of
this
insurmountable
obstacle
the
head
of
the
column
tried
to
stop
and
turn
but
the
irresistible
pressure
of
the
enormous
crowd
behind
pushed
the
front
ranks
on
at
this
juncture
a
shot
was
fired
on
which
side
is
not
known
a
panic
ensued
followed
by
a
volley
eighty
fell
dead
or
wounded
then
arose
a
general
cry
of
horror
and
fury
vengeance
the
bodies
of
the
victims
were
placed
in
a
tumbril
lighted
by
torches
the
crowd
faced
about
and
amid
imprecations
resumed
its
march
which
had
now
assumed
the
character
of
a
funeral
procession
in
a
few
hours
paris
was
bristling
with
barricades
the
at
daybreak
from
my
balcony
i
see
advancing
a
noisy
column
of
people
among
whom
are
a
number
of
national
guards
the
mob
stops
in
front
of
the
mairie
which
is
guarded
by
about
thirty
municipal
guards
and
with
loud
cries
demands
the
soldiers
arms
flat
refusal
by
the
municipal
guards
menacing
clamours
of
the
crowd
two
national
guard
officers
intervene
what
is
the
use
of
further
bloodshed
resistance
will
be
the
municipal
guards
lay
down
their
rifles
and
ammunition
and
withdraw
without
being
molested
the
mayor
of
the
eighth
arrondissement
ernest
moreau
requests
me
to
come
to
the
mairie
he
tells
me
the
appalling
news
of
the
massacre
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
and
at
brief
intervals
further
news
of
increasing
seriousness
arrives
the
national
guard
this
time
has
definitely
turned
against
the
government
and
is
shouting
hurrah
for
reform
the
army
frightened
at
what
it
did
yesterday
appears
resolved
not
to
take
any
further
part
in
the
fratricidal
struggle
in
the
rue
sainte
croix
la
bretonnerie
the
troops
have
fallen
back
before
the
national
guard
at
the
neighbouring
mairie
of
the
ninth
arrondissement
we
are
informed
the
soldiers
are
fraternising
and
patrolling
with
the
national
guard
two
other
messengers
in
blouses
arrive
almost
together
the
reuilly
barracks
has
been
the
minimes
barracks
has
and
from
the
government
i
have
neither
instructions
nor
news
says
ernest
moreau
what
government
if
any
is
there
is
the
mole
ministry
still
in
existence
what
is
to
be
done
go
to
the
prefecture
of
the
seine
advises
perret
a
member
of
the
general
council
it
isn
t
far
to
the
hotel
de
well
then
come
with
they
go
i
reconnoitre
round
the
place
royale
everywhere
reign
agitation
anxiety
and
feverish
expectation
everywhere
work
is
being
actively
pushed
upon
barricades
that
are
already
formidable
this
time
it
is
more
than
a
riot
it
is
an
insurrection
i
return
home
a
soldier
of
the
line
on
sentry
duty
at
the
entrance
to
the
place
royale
is
chatting
amicably
with
the
vedette
of
a
barricade
constructed
twenty
paces
from
him
at
a
quarter
past
eight
ernest
moreau
returns
from
the
hotel
de
ville
he
has
seen
de
rambuteau
and
brings
slightly
better
news
the
king
has
entrusted
the
formation
of
a
cabinet
to
thiers
and
odilon
barrot
thiers
is
not
very
popular
but
odilon
barrot
means
reform
unfortunately
the
concession
is
coupled
with
a
threat
marshal
bugeaud
has
been
invested
with
the
general
command
of
the
national
guard
and
of
the
army
odilon
barrot
means
reform
but
bugeaud
means
repression
the
king
is
holding
out
his
right
hand
and
clenching
his
left
fist
the
prefect
requested
moreau
to
spread
and
proclaim
the
news
in
his
quarter
and
in
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
this
is
what
i
will
do
says
the
mayor
very
good
i
observe
but
believe
me
you
will
do
well
to
announce
the
ministry
and
say
nothing
about
marshal
you
are
the
mayor
requisitions
a
squad
of
national
guards
takes
with
him
his
two
deputies
and
the
municipal
councillors
present
and
descends
into
the
place
royale
the
roll
of
drums
attracts
the
crowd
he
announces
the
new
cabinet
the
people
applaud
and
raise
repeated
shouts
of
hurrah
for
reform
the
mayor
adds
a
few
words
recommending
harmony
and
the
preservation
of
order
and
is
universally
applauded
the
situation
is
saved
he
says
grasping
my
hand
yes
i
answer
if
bugeaud
will
give
up
the
idea
of
being
the
ernest
moreau
followed
by
his
escort
goes
off
to
repeat
his
proclamation
in
the
place
de
la
bastille
and
the
faubourg
and
i
return
home
to
reassure
my
family
half
an
hour
later
the
mayor
and
his
cortege
return
greatly
agitated
and
in
disorder
to
the
mairie
this
is
what
had
happened
the
place
de
la
bastille
was
occupied
at
its
two
extremities
by
troops
leaning
on
their
rifles
the
people
moved
freely
and
peaceably
between
the
two
lines
the
mayor
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
july
column
made
his
proclamation
and
once
again
the
crowd
applauded
vigorously
moreau
started
towards
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
at
this
moment
a
number
of
workingmen
accosted
the
soldiers
amicably
and
said
your
arms
give
up
your
in
obedience
to
the
energetic
orders
of
their
captain
the
soldiers
refused
suddenly
a
shot
was
fired
it
was
followed
by
other
shots
the
terrible
panic
of
the
previous
day
was
perhaps
about
to
be
renewed
moreau
and
his
escort
were
pushed
about
thrown
down
the
firing
on
both
sides
lasted
over
a
minute
and
five
or
six
persons
were
killed
or
wounded
fortunately
this
time
the
affray
occurred
in
broad
daylight
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
they
had
shed
there
was
a
revulsion
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
troops
and
after
a
moment
of
surprise
and
horror
the
soldiers
prompted
by
an
irresistible
impulse
raised
the
butts
of
their
rifles
in
the
air
and
shouted
long
live
the
national
guard
the
general
in
command
being
powerless
to
control
his
men
went
off
to
vincennes
by
way
of
the
quays
and
the
people
remained
masters
of
the
bastille
and
of
the
faubourg
it
is
a
result
that
might
have
cost
more
dear
in
my
case
especially
remarks
moreau
and
he
shows
us
his
hat
which
has
been
pierced
by
a
bullet
a
brand
new
hat
he
adds
with
a
laugh
half
past
ten
o
three
students
from
the
ecole
polytechnique
have
arrived
at
the
mairie
they
report
that
the
students
have
broken
out
of
the
school
and
have
come
to
place
themselves
at
the
disposition
of
the
people
a
certain
number
have
therefore
distributed
themselves
among
the
mairies
of
paris
the
insurrection
is
making
progress
every
hour
it
now
demands
that
marshal
bugeaud
be
replaced
and
the
chamber
dissolved
the
pupils
of
the
ecole
polytechnique
go
further
and
talk
about
the
abdication
of
the
king
what
is
happening
at
the
tuileries
there
is
no
news
either
from
the
ministry
no
order
from
the
general
staff
i
decide
to
go
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
by
way
of
the
hotel
de
ville
and
ernest
moreau
is
kind
enough
to
accompany
me
we
find
the
rue
saint
antoine
bristling
with
barricades
we
make
ourselves
known
and
the
insurgents
help
us
to
clamber
over
the
heaps
of
as
we
draw
near
to
the
hotel
de
ville
from
which
the
roar
of
a
great
crowd
reaches
our
ears
and
as
we
cross
some
ground
on
which
are
buildings
in
course
of
erection
we
see
coming
towards
us
with
hurried
steps
de
rambuteau
the
prefect
of
the
seine
hi
monsieur
the
prefect
what
brings
you
here
i
cry
prefect
do
i
know
whether
i
am
still
prefect
he
replies
with
a
surly
air
a
crowd
which
looks
anything
but
benevolent
has
already
begun
to
gather
moreau
notices
a
house
that
is
to
let
we
enter
it
and
de
rambuteau
recounts
his
misadventure
i
was
in
my
office
with
two
or
three
municipal
councillors
he
says
when
we
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
corridor
the
door
was
thrown
violently
open
and
there
entered
unto
me
a
big
strapping
captain
of
the
national
guard
at
the
head
of
an
excited
body
of
troops
monsieur
said
the
man
you
must
get
out
of
pardon
me
monsieur
here
at
the
hotel
de
ville
i
am
at
home
and
here
i
propose
to
yesterday
you
were
perhaps
at
home
in
the
hotel
de
ville
the
people
are
at
home
in
ah
but
go
to
the
window
and
look
out
on
the
the
square
had
been
invaded
by
a
noisy
swarming
crowd
in
which
workingmen
national
guards
and
soldiers
were
mingled
and
the
rifles
of
the
soldiers
wore
in
the
hands
of
the
men
of
the
people
i
turned
to
the
intruders
and
said
you
are
right
messieurs
you
are
the
masters
well
then
said
the
captain
instruct
your
employés
to
recognise
my
that
was
too
much
i
replied
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
gathered
up
a
few
papers
issued
a
few
orders
and
here
i
am
since
you
are
going
to
the
chamber
if
there
is
still
a
chamber
tell
the
minister
of
the
interior
if
the
ministry
still
exists
that
at
the
hotel
de
ville
there
is
no
longer
either
prefect
or
it
is
with
great
difficulty
that
we
make
our
way
through
the
human
ocean
that
with
a
noise
as
of
a
tempest
covers
the
place
de
hotel
de
ville
at
the
quai
de
la
mégisserie
is
a
formidable
barricade
thanks
to
the
mayor
s
sash
shown
by
my
companion
we
are
allowed
to
clamber
over
it
beyond
this
the
quays
are
almost
deserted
we
reach
the
chamber
of
deputies
by
the
left
bank
of
the
river
the
palais
bourbon
is
encumbered
by
a
buzzing
crowd
of
deputies
peers
and
high
functionaries
from
a
rather
large
group
comes
the
sharp
voice
of
thiers
ah
here
is
victor
hugo
he
comes
to
us
and
asks
for
news
about
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
we
add
that
about
the
hotel
de
ville
he
shakes
his
head
gloomily
and
how
are
things
here
i
question
in
turn
but
first
of
all
are
you
still
a
minister
i
oh
i
am
nobody
odilon
barrot
is
president
of
the
council
and
minister
of
the
and
marshal
bugeaud
he
has
also
been
replaced
by
marshal
gerard
but
that
is
nothing
the
chamber
has
been
dissolved
the
king
has
abdicated
and
is
on
his
way
to
saint
cloud
and
the
duchess
d
orleans
is
regent
ah
the
tide
is
rising
rising
rising
thiers
advises
us
ernest
moreau
and
me
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
odilon
barrot
action
by
us
in
our
quarter
which
is
such
an
important
one
can
be
of
very
great
utility
we
therefore
set
out
for
the
ministry
of
the
interior
the
people
have
invaded
the
ministry
and
crowded
it
to
the
very
office
of
the
minister
where
a
not
over
respectful
crowd
comes
and
goes
at
a
large
table
in
the
middle
of
the
vast
room
secretaries
are
writing
odilon
barrot
his
face
red
his
lips
compressed
and
his
hands
behind
his
back
is
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
you
know
what
is
going
on
do
you
not
he
says
when
he
sees
us
the
king
has
abdicated
and
the
duchess
d
orleans
is
if
the
people
so
wills
says
a
man
in
a
blouse
who
is
passing
the
minister
leads
us
to
the
recess
of
a
window
looking
uneasily
about
him
as
he
does
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
are
you
doing
i
query
i
am
sending
telegrams
to
the
is
this
very
urgent
france
must
be
informed
of
yes
but
meanwhile
paris
is
making
events
alas
has
it
finished
making
them
the
regency
is
all
very
well
but
it
has
got
to
be
yes
by
the
chamber
the
duchess
d
orleans
ought
to
take
the
count
de
paris
to
the
no
since
the
chamber
has
been
dissolved
if
the
duchess
ought
to
go
anywhere
it
is
to
the
hotel
de
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
what
about
the
danger
there
is
no
danger
a
mother
a
child
i
will
answer
for
the
people
they
will
respect
the
woman
in
the
princess
well
then
go
to
the
tuileries
see
the
duchess
d
orleans
advise
her
enlighten
why
do
you
not
go
yourself
i
have
just
come
from
there
nobody
knew
where
the
duchess
was
i
could
not
get
near
her
but
if
you
see
her
tell
her
that
i
am
at
her
disposal
that
i
await
her
orders
ah
monsieur
victor
hugo
i
would
give
my
life
for
that
woman
and
for
that
child
odilon
barrot
is
the
most
honest
and
the
most
devoted
man
in
the
world
but
he
is
the
opposite
of
a
man
of
action
one
feels
trouble
and
indecision
in
his
words
in
his
look
in
his
whole
person
listen
he
goes
on
what
must
be
done
what
is
urgent
is
that
the
people
should
be
made
acquainted
with
these
grave
changes
the
abdication
and
regency
promise
me
that
you
will
proclaim
them
at
your
mairie
in
the
faubourg
and
wherever
you
possibly
i
i
go
off
with
moreau
towards
the
tuileries
in
the
rue
bellechasse
are
galloping
horses
a
squadron
of
dragoons
flashes
by
and
seems
to
be
fleeing
from
a
man
with
bare
arms
who
is
running
behind
them
and
brandishing
a
sword
the
tuileries
are
still
guarded
by
troops
the
mayor
shows
his
sash
and
they
let
us
pass
at
the
gate
the
concierge
to
whom
i
make
myself
known
apprises
us
that
the
duchess
d
orleans
accompanied
by
the
duke
de
nemours
has
just
left
the
château
with
the
count
de
paris
no
doubt
to
go
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
we
have
therefore
no
other
course
than
to
continue
on
our
way
at
the
entrance
to
the
carrousel
bridge
bullets
whistle
by
our
ears
insurgents
in
the
place
du
carrousel
are
firing
upon
the
court
carriages
leaving
the
stables
one
of
the
coachmen
has
been
killed
on
his
box
it
would
be
too
stupid
of
us
to
stay
here
looking
on
and
get
ourselves
killed
says
ernest
moreau
let
us
cross
the
we
skirt
the
institute
and
the
quai
de
la
monnaie
at
the
pont
neuf
we
pass
a
band
of
men
armed
with
pikes
axes
and
rifles
headed
by
a
drummer
and
led
by
a
man
brandishing
a
sabre
and
wearing
a
long
coat
of
the
king
s
livery
it
is
the
coat
of
the
coachman
who
has
just
been
killed
in
the
rue
saint
thomas
du
louvre
when
we
arrive
moreau
and
i
at
the
place
royale
we
find
it
filled
with
an
anxious
crowd
we
are
immediately
surrounded
and
questioned
and
it
is
not
without
some
difficulty
that
we
reach
the
mairie
the
mass
of
people
is
too
compact
to
admit
of
our
addressing
them
in
the
place
i
ascend
with
the
mayor
a
few
officers
of
the
national
guard
and
two
students
of
the
ecole
polytechnique
to
the
balcony
of
the
mairie
i
raise
my
hand
the
crowd
becomes
silent
as
though
by
magic
and
i
say
my
friends
you
are
waiting
for
news
this
is
what
we
know
thiers
is
no
longer
minister
and
marshal
bugeaud
is
no
longer
in
command
applause
they
have
been
replaced
by
marshal
gerard
and
odilon
barrot
applause
but
less
general
the
chamber
has
been
dissolved
the
king
has
abdicated
general
cheering
the
duchess
d
orleans
is
a
few
isolated
bravos
mingled
with
low
murmurs
i
continue
the
name
of
odilon
barrot
is
a
guarantee
that
the
widest
and
most
open
appeal
will
be
made
to
the
nation
and
that
you
will
have
in
all
sincerity
a
representative
my
declaration
is
responded
to
with
applause
from
several
points
but
it
appears
evident
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
crowd
is
uncertain
as
to
what
view
of
the
situation
they
ought
to
take
and
are
not
satisfied
we
the
hall
of
the
mairie
now
i
say
to
ernest
moreau
i
must
go
and
proclaim
the
news
in
the
place
de
la
but
the
mayor
is
discouraged
you
can
very
well
see
that
it
is
useless
he
says
sadly
the
regency
is
not
accepted
and
you
have
spoken
here
in
a
quarter
where
you
are
known
and
loved
at
the
bastille
your
audience
will
be
the
revolutionary
people
of
the
faubourg
who
will
perhaps
harm
i
will
go
i
say
i
promised
odilon
barrot
that
i
i
have
changed
my
hat
the
mayor
goes
on
but
remember
my
hat
of
this
this
morning
the
army
and
the
people
were
face
to
face
and
there
was
danger
of
a
conflict
now
however
the
people
are
alone
the
people
are
the
masters
and
hostile
have
a
care
no
matter
i
have
promised
and
i
will
keep
my
i
tell
the
mayor
that
his
place
is
at
the
mairie
and
that
he
ought
to
stay
there
but
several
national
guard
officers
present
themselves
spontaneously
and
offer
to
accompany
me
among
them
the
excellent
launaye
my
former
captain
i
accept
their
friendly
offer
and
we
form
a
little
procession
and
proceed
by
the
rue
du
pas
de
la
mule
and
the
boulevard
beaumarchais
towards
the
place
de
la
bastille
here
are
a
restless
eager
crowd
in
which
workingmen
predominate
many
of
them
armed
with
rifles
taken
from
the
barracks
or
given
up
to
them
by
the
soldiers
shouts
and
the
song
of
the
girondins
die
for
the
fatherland
numerous
groups
debating
and
disputing
passionately
they
turn
round
they
look
at
us
they
interrogate
us
what
s
the
news
what
is
going
on
and
they
follow
us
i
hear
my
name
mentioned
coupled
with
various
sentiments
victor
hugo
it
s
victor
hugo
a
few
salute
me
when
we
reach
the
column
of
july
we
are
surrounded
by
a
considerable
gathering
in
order
that
i
may
be
heard
i
mount
upon
the
base
of
the
column
i
will
only
repeat
the
words
which
it
was
possible
for
me
to
make
my
turbulent
audience
hear
it
was
much
less
a
speech
than
a
dialogue
but
the
dialogue
of
one
voice
with
ten
twenty
a
hundred
voices
more
or
less
hostile
i
began
by
announcing
at
once
the
abdication
of
louis
philippe
and
as
in
the
place
royale
applause
that
was
practically
unanimous
greeted
the
news
there
were
also
however
cries
of
no
no
abdication
deposition
deposition
decidedly
i
was
going
to
have
my
hands
full
when
i
announced
the
regency
violent
protests
arose
no
no
no
regency
down
with
the
bourbons
neither
king
nor
queen
no
masters
i
repeated
no
masters
i
don
t
want
them
any
more
than
you
do
i
have
defended
liberty
all
my
then
why
do
you
proclaim
the
regency
because
a
is
not
a
master
besides
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
proclaim
the
regency
i
merely
announce
no
no
no
regency
a
man
in
a
blouse
shouted
let
the
peer
of
france
be
silent
down
with
the
peer
of
france
and
he
levelled
his
rifle
at
me
i
gazed
at
him
steadily
and
raised
my
voice
so
loudly
that
the
crowd
became
silent
yes
i
am
a
peer
of
france
and
i
speak
as
a
peer
of
france
i
swore
fidelity
not
to
a
royal
personage
but
to
the
constitutional
monarchy
as
long
as
no
other
government
is
established
it
is
my
duty
to
be
faithful
to
this
one
and
i
have
always
thought
that
the
people
approved
of
a
man
who
did
his
duty
whatever
that
duty
might
there
was
a
murmur
of
approbation
and
here
and
there
a
few
bravos
but
when
i
endeavoured
to
continue
if
the
regency
the
protests
redoubled
i
was
permitted
to
take
up
only
one
of
these
protests
a
workman
had
shouted
we
will
not
be
governed
by
a
i
retorted
quickly
well
neither
will
i
be
governed
by
a
woman
nor
even
by
a
man
it
was
because
louis
philippe
wanted
to
govern
that
his
abdication
is
necessary
and
just
but
a
woman
who
reigns
in
the
name
of
a
child
is
that
not
a
guarantee
against
all
thought
of
personal
government
look
at
queen
victoria
in
england
we
are
french
we
are
shouted
several
voices
no
regency
no
regency
then
what
nothing
is
ready
nothing
it
means
a
total
upheaval
ruin
distress
civil
war
perhaps
in
any
case
it
is
the
one
voice
a
single
voice
cried
long
live
the
republic
no
other
voice
echoed
it
poor
great
people
irresponsible
and
blind
they
know
what
they
do
not
want
but
they
do
not
know
what
they
do
want
from
this
moment
the
noise
the
shouts
the
menaces
became
such
that
i
gave
up
the
attempt
to
get
myself
heard
my
brave
launaye
said
you
have
done
what
you
wanted
to
what
you
promised
to
do
the
only
thing
that
remains
for
us
to
do
is
to
the
crowd
opened
before
us
curious
and
inoffensive
but
twenty
paces
from
the
column
the
man
who
had
threatened
me
with
his
rifle
came
up
with
us
and
again
levelled
his
weapon
at
me
shouting
down
with
the
peer
of
france
no
respect
the
great
man
cried
a
young
workman
who
with
a
quick
movement
pushed
the
rifle
downward
i
thanked
this
unknown
friend
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
passed
on
at
the
mairie
ernest
moreau
who
it
appears
had
been
very
anxious
about
us
received
us
with
joy
and
cordially
congratulated
me
but
i
knew
that
even
when
their
passions
are
aroused
the
people
are
just
and
not
the
slightest
credit
was
due
to
me
for
i
had
not
been
uneasy
in
the
least
while
these
things
were
happening
in
the
place
de
la
bastille
this
is
what
was
taking
place
at
the
palais
bourbon
there
is
at
this
moment
a
man
whose
name
is
in
everybody
s
mouth
and
the
thought
of
whom
is
in
everybody
s
mind
that
man
is
lamartine
his
eloquent
and
vivid
of
the
has
for
the
first
time
taught
the
revolution
to
france
hitherto
he
had
only
been
illustrious
he
has
become
popular
and
may
be
said
to
hold
paris
in
his
hand
in
the
universal
confusion
his
influence
could
be
decisive
this
is
what
they
said
to
themselves
in
the
offices
of
the
national
where
the
possible
chances
of
the
republic
had
been
weighed
and
where
a
scheme
for
a
provisional
government
had
been
sketched
from
which
lamartine
had
been
left
out
in
at
the
time
of
the
debate
over
the
regency
which
resulted
in
the
choice
of
the
duke
de
nemours
lamartine
had
pleaded
warmly
for
the
duchess
d
orleans
was
he
imbued
with
the
same
ideas
what
did
he
want
what
would
he
do
it
was
necessary
that
this
should
be
ascertained
armand
marrast
the
of
the
national
took
with
him
three
notorious
republicans
bastide
hetzel
the
publisher
and
bocage
the
eminent
comedian
who
created
the
role
of
didier
in
marion
de
all
four
went
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
they
found
lamartine
there
and
held
a
conference
with
him
in
one
of
the
offices
they
all
spoke
in
turn
and
expressed
their
convictions
and
hopes
they
would
be
happy
to
think
that
lamartine
was
with
them
for
the
immediate
realization
of
the
republic
if
however
he
judged
that
the
transition
of
the
regency
was
necessary
they
asked
him
to
at
least
aid
them
in
obtaining
serious
guarantees
against
any
retrogression
they
awaited
with
emotion
his
decision
in
this
great
matter
lamartine
listened
to
their
reasons
in
silence
then
requested
them
to
allow
him
a
few
minutes
for
reflection
he
sat
apart
from
them
at
a
table
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
thought
his
four
visitors
standing
and
silent
gazed
at
him
respectfully
it
was
a
solemn
moment
we
listened
to
history
passing
said
bocage
to
me
lamartine
raised
his
head
and
said
i
will
oppose
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
duchess
d
orleans
arrived
at
the
chamber
holding
by
the
hand
her
two
sons
the
count
de
paris
and
the
duke
de
chartres
odilon
barrot
was
not
with
her
the
duke
de
nemours
accompanied
her
she
was
acclaimed
by
the
deputies
but
the
chamber
having
been
dissolved
were
there
any
deputies
crémieux
ascended
the
tribune
and
flatly
proposed
a
provisional
government
odilon
barrot
who
had
been
fetched
from
the
ministry
of
the
interior
made
his
appearance
at
last
and
pleaded
for
the
regency
but
without
éclat
and
without
energy
suddenly
a
mob
of
people
and
national
guards
with
arms
and
flags
invaded
the
chamber
the
duchess
d
orleans
persuaded
by
her
friends
withdrew
with
her
children
the
chamber
of
deputies
then
vanished
submerged
by
a
sort
of
revolutionary
assembly
harangued
this
crowd
next
came
lamartine
who
was
awaited
and
acclaimed
he
opposed
the
regency
as
he
had
promised
that
settled
it
the
names
for
a
provisional
government
were
proposed
to
the
people
and
by
shouts
of
yes
or
no
the
people
elected
successively
lamartine
dupont
de
l
eure
arago
and
unanimously
crémieux
and
marie
by
a
majority
the
new
ministers
at
once
set
out
for
the
hotel
de
ville
at
the
chamber
of
deputies
not
once
was
the
word
republic
uttered
in
any
of
the
speeches
of
the
orators
not
even
in
that
of
but
now
outside
in
the
street
the
elect
of
the
people
heard
this
words
this
shout
everywhere
it
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
filled
the
air
of
paris
the
seven
men
who
in
these
supreme
and
extreme
days
held
the
destiny
of
france
in
their
hands
were
themselves
at
once
tools
and
playthings
in
the
hands
of
the
mob
which
is
not
the
people
and
of
chance
which
is
not
providence
under
the
pressure
of
the
multitude
in
the
bewilderment
and
terror
of
their
triumph
which
overwhelmed
them
they
decreed
the
republic
without
having
time
to
think
that
they
were
doing
such
a
great
thing
when
having
been
separated
and
dispersed
by
the
violent
pushing
of
the
crowd
they
were
able
to
find
each
other
again
and
reassemble
or
rather
hide
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
hotel
de
ville
they
took
half
a
sheet
of
paper
at
the
head
of
which
were
printed
the
words
prefecture
of
the
seine
office
of
the
de
rambuteau
may
that
very
morning
have
used
the
other
half
of
the
sheet
to
write
a
to
one
of
his
little
bourgeoises
as
he
called
them
under
the
dictation
of
terrible
shouts
outside
lamartine
traced
this
phrase
the
provisional
government
declares
that
the
provisional
government
of
france
is
the
republican
government
and
that
the
nation
shall
be
immediately
called
upon
to
ratify
the
resolution
of
the
provisional
government
and
of
the
people
of
i
had
this
paper
this
sheet
smeared
and
blotted
with
ink
in
my
hands
it
was
still
stamped
still
palpitating
so
to
speak
with
the
fever
of
the
moment
the
words
hurriedly
scribbled
were
scarcely
formed
was
written
when
these
half
dozen
lines
had
been
written
lamartine
handed
the
sheet
to
read
aloud
the
phrase
the
provisional
government
declares
that
the
provisional
government
of
france
is
the
republican
government
the
word
provisional
occurs
twice
he
commented
that
is
so
said
the
others
one
of
them
at
least
must
be
effaced
added
lamartine
understood
the
significance
of
this
grammatical
observation
which
was
simply
a
political
revolution
but
we
must
await
the
sanction
of
france
he
said
i
can
do
without
the
sanction
of
france
cried
when
i
have
the
sanction
of
the
of
the
people
of
paris
but
who
knows
at
present
what
is
the
will
of
the
people
of
france
observed
lamartine
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
the
noise
of
the
multitude
without
sounded
like
the
murmuring
of
the
ocean
went
on
what
the
people
want
is
the
republic
at
once
the
republic
without
the
republic
without
any
delay
said
lamartine
covering
an
objection
in
this
interpretation
of
s
words
we
are
provisional
returned
but
the
republic
is
not
crémieux
took
the
pen
from
lamartine
s
hands
scratched
out
the
word
provisional
at
the
end
of
the
third
line
and
wrote
beside
it
the
actual
government
very
well
said
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulder
the
seal
of
the
city
of
paris
was
on
the
table
since
the
vessel
sailing
beneath
a
sky
starred
with
and
with
the
device
clarius
had
disappeared
from
the
seal
of
the
city
the
seal
was
merely
a
circle
with
the
words
ville
de
paris
in
the
centre
crémieux
took
the
seal
and
stamped
the
paper
so
hastily
with
it
that
the
words
appeared
upside
down
but
they
did
not
sign
this
rough
draught
their
whereabouts
had
been
discovered
an
impetuous
stream
was
surging
against
the
door
of
the
office
in
which
they
had
taken
refuge
the
people
were
calling
ordering
them
to
go
to
the
of
the
municipal
council
there
they
were
greeted
by
this
clamour
the
republic
long
live
the
republic
proclaim
the
republic
lamartine
who
was
at
first
interrupted
by
the
cries
succeeded
at
length
with
his
grand
voice
in
calming
this
feverish
impatience
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
were
thus
enabled
to
return
and
resume
their
session
and
lively
discussion
the
more
ardent
ones
wanted
the
document
to
read
the
provisional
government
proclaims
the
the
moderates
proposed
the
provisional
government
desires
the
a
compromise
was
reached
on
the
proposition
of
crémieux
and
the
sentence
was
made
to
read
the
provisional
government
is
for
the
to
this
was
added
subject
to
the
ratification
of
the
people
who
will
be
immediately
the
news
was
at
once
announced
to
the
crowds
in
the
and
in
the
square
outside
who
would
listen
to
nothing
but
the
word
republic
and
saluted
it
with
tremendous
cheering
the
republic
was
established
as
lamartine
observed
later
the
during
the
morning
everything
at
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mairie
of
the
eighth
arrondissement
was
relatively
calm
and
the
steps
to
maintain
order
taken
the
previous
day
with
the
approval
of
ernest
moreau
appeared
to
have
assured
the
security
of
the
quarter
i
thought
i
might
leave
the
place
royale
and
repair
towards
the
centre
of
the
city
with
my
son
victor
the
restlessness
and
agitation
of
a
people
of
the
people
of
paris
on
the
morrow
of
a
revolution
was
a
spectacle
that
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
me
on
the
evening
of
the
there
had
been
reason
to
apprehend
disturbances
in
the
eighth
arrondissement
disturbances
particularly
serious
in
that
they
would
not
have
been
of
a
political
character
the
prowlers
and
with
mien
who
seem
to
issue
from
the
earth
in
times
of
trouble
were
very
much
in
evidence
in
the
streets
at
the
prison
of
la
force
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
the
common
law
criminals
had
begun
a
revolt
by
locking
up
their
keepers
to
what
public
force
could
appeal
be
made
the
municipal
guard
had
been
disbanded
the
army
was
confined
to
barracks
as
to
the
police
no
one
would
have
known
where
to
find
them
victor
hugo
in
a
speech
which
this
time
was
cheered
confided
life
and
property
to
the
protection
and
devotedness
of
the
people
a
civic
guard
in
blouses
was
improvised
empty
shops
that
were
to
let
were
transformed
into
guard
houses
patrols
were
organized
and
sentries
posted
the
rebellious
prisoners
at
la
force
terrified
by
the
assertion
that
cannon
which
did
not
exist
had
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
prison
and
that
unless
they
surrendered
promptly
and
unconditionally
they
would
be
blown
submitted
quietly
and
returned
to
work
the
weather
was
cloudy
but
mild
and
the
rain
held
off
the
streets
were
thrilling
with
a
noisy
joyous
crowd
the
people
continued
with
incredible
ardour
to
fortify
the
barricades
that
had
already
been
constructed
and
even
to
build
new
ones
bands
of
them
with
flags
flying
and
drums
beating
marched
about
shouting
long
live
the
republic
and
singing
the
marseillaise
and
die
for
the
fatherland
the
cafés
were
crowded
to
overflowing
but
many
of
the
shops
were
closed
as
on
holidays
and
indeed
the
city
did
present
a
holiday
appearance
i
made
my
way
along
the
quays
to
the
pont
neuf
there
at
the
bottom
of
a
proclamation
i
read
the
name
of
lamartine
and
having
seen
the
people
i
experienced
the
desire
to
see
my
great
friend
i
therefore
turned
back
with
victor
towards
the
hotel
de
ville
as
on
the
previous
day
the
square
in
front
of
the
building
was
filled
with
a
crowd
and
the
crowd
was
so
compact
that
it
immobilized
itself
it
was
impossible
to
approach
the
steps
of
the
front
entrance
after
several
attempts
to
get
somewhere
near
to
them
i
was
about
to
force
my
way
back
out
of
the
crowd
when
i
was
perceived
by
the
brother
of
my
young
friend
paul
meurice
he
was
a
major
of
the
national
guard
and
on
duty
with
his
battalion
at
the
hotel
de
ville
make
way
he
shouted
authoritatively
make
way
for
victor
hugo
and
the
human
wall
opened
how
i
do
not
know
before
his
epaulettes
the
entrance
once
passed
guided
us
up
all
sorts
of
stairways
and
through
corridors
and
rooms
encumbered
with
people
as
we
were
passing
a
man
came
from
a
group
and
planting
himself
in
front
of
me
said
citizen
victor
hugo
shout
long
live
the
republic
i
will
shout
nothing
by
order
said
i
do
you
understand
what
liberty
is
for
my
part
i
practise
it
i
will
shout
long
live
the
people
because
it
pleases
me
to
do
so
the
day
when
i
shout
long
live
the
republic
it
will
be
because
i
want
hear
hear
he
is
right
murmured
several
voices
and
we
passed
on
after
many
detours
ushered
us
into
a
small
room
where
he
left
us
while
he
went
to
inform
lamartine
that
i
wished
to
see
him
the
glass
door
of
the
room
gave
on
to
a
gallery
passing
along
which
i
saw
my
friend
david
d
angers
the
great
statuary
i
called
to
him
david
who
was
an
republican
was
beaming
ah
my
friend
what
a
glorious
day
he
exclaimed
he
told
me
that
the
provisional
government
had
appointed
him
mayor
of
the
eleventh
arrondissement
they
have
sent
for
you
for
something
of
the
same
kind
i
suppose
he
said
no
i
answered
i
have
not
been
sent
for
i
came
of
my
own
accord
just
to
shake
lamartine
s
returned
and
announced
that
lamartine
awaited
me
i
left
victor
in
the
room
telling
him
to
wait
there
till
i
came
back
and
once
more
followed
my
obliging
guide
through
more
corridors
that
led
to
a
vestibule
that
was
crowded
with
people
they
are
all
office
seekers
explained
the
provisional
government
was
holding
a
session
in
the
adjoining
room
the
door
was
guarded
by
two
armed
grenadiers
of
the
national
guard
who
were
impassible
and
deaf
alike
to
entreaties
and
menaces
i
had
to
force
my
way
through
this
crowd
one
of
the
grenadiers
on
the
lookout
for
me
opened
the
door
a
little
way
to
let
me
in
the
crowd
immediately
made
a
rush
and
tried
to
push
past
the
sentries
who
however
aided
by
forced
them
back
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
i
was
in
a
spacious
hall
that
formed
the
angle
of
one
of
the
pavilions
of
the
hotel
de
ville
and
was
lighted
on
two
sides
by
long
windows
i
would
have
preferred
to
find
lamartine
alone
but
there
were
with
him
dispersed
about
the
room
and
talking
to
friends
or
writing
three
or
four
of
his
colleagues
in
the
provisional
government
arago
marie
and
armand
marrast
lamartine
rose
as
i
entered
on
his
which
was
buttoned
up
as
usual
he
wore
an
ample
sash
slung
across
his
shoulder
he
advanced
to
meet
me
and
stretching
out
his
hand
exclaimed
ah
you
have
come
over
to
us
victor
hugo
is
a
strong
recruit
indeed
for
the
not
so
fast
my
friend
said
i
with
a
laugh
i
have
come
simply
to
see
my
friend
lamartine
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
yesterday
while
you
were
opposing
the
regency
in
the
chamber
i
was
defending
it
in
the
place
de
la
yesterday
that
was
all
right
but
there
is
now
neither
regency
nor
royalty
it
is
impossible
that
victor
hugo
is
not
at
heart
in
principle
yes
i
am
the
republic
is
in
my
opinion
the
only
rational
form
of
government
the
only
one
worthy
of
the
nations
the
universal
republic
is
inevitable
in
the
natural
course
of
progress
but
has
its
hour
struck
in
france
it
is
because
i
want
the
republic
that
i
want
it
to
be
durable
and
definitive
you
are
going
to
consult
the
nation
are
you
not
the
whole
nation
the
whole
nation
assuredly
we
of
the
provisional
government
are
all
for
universal
at
this
moment
arago
came
up
to
us
with
armand
marrast
who
held
a
folded
paper
in
his
hand
my
dear
friend
said
lamartine
know
that
this
morning
we
selected
you
for
mayor
of
your
and
here
is
the
patent
signed
by
us
all
said
armand
marrast
i
thank
you
said
i
but
i
can
not
accept
why
continued
arago
these
are
and
purely
gratuitous
we
were
informed
just
now
about
the
attempted
revolt
at
la
force
added
lamartine
you
did
better
than
suppress
it
you
forestalled
it
you
are
loved
and
respected
in
your
my
authority
is
wholly
moral
i
rejoined
it
could
but
lose
weight
in
becoming
official
besides
on
no
account
would
i
dispossess
ernest
moreau
who
has
borne
himself
loyally
and
valiantly
throughout
this
lamartine
and
arago
insisted
do
not
refuse
our
very
well
said
i
i
will
take
it
for
the
sake
of
the
autographs
but
it
is
understood
that
i
keep
it
in
my
yes
keep
it
said
armand
marrast
laughingly
so
that
you
can
say
that
one
day
you
were
and
the
next
day
lamartine
took
me
aside
into
the
recess
of
a
window
it
is
not
a
mairie
i
would
like
you
to
have
but
a
ministry
victor
hugo
the
republic
s
minister
of
instruction
come
now
since
you
say
that
you
are
republican
republican
in
principle
but
in
fact
i
was
yesterday
peer
of
france
i
was
yesterday
for
the
regency
and
believing
the
republic
to
be
premature
i
should
be
also
for
the
regency
nations
are
above
dynasties
went
on
lamartine
i
too
have
been
a
yes
but
you
were
a
deputy
elected
by
the
nation
i
was
a
peer
appointed
by
the
the
king
in
choosing
you
under
the
terms
of
the
constitution
in
one
of
the
categories
from
which
the
upper
house
was
recruited
but
honoured
the
peerage
and
also
honoured
i
thank
you
said
i
but
you
look
at
things
from
the
outside
i
consider
them
in
my
we
were
interrupted
by
the
noise
of
a
prolonged
fusillade
which
broke
out
suddenly
on
the
square
a
bullet
smashed
a
above
our
heads
what
is
the
matter
now
exclaimed
lamartine
in
sorrowful
tones
armand
marrast
and
marie
went
out
to
see
what
was
going
on
ah
my
friend
continued
lamartine
how
heavy
is
this
revolutionary
power
to
bear
one
has
to
assume
such
weighty
and
such
sudden
responsibilities
before
one
s
conscience
and
in
presence
of
history
i
do
not
know
how
i
have
been
living
during
the
past
ten
days
yesterday
i
had
a
few
grey
hairs
they
will
be
yes
but
you
are
doing
your
duty
as
a
man
of
genius
grandly
i
commented
in
a
few
minutes
armand
marrast
returned
it
was
not
against
us
he
said
how
the
lamentable
affray
came
about
could
not
be
explained
to
me
there
was
a
collision
the
rifles
went
off
why
was
it
a
misunderstanding
was
it
a
quarrel
between
socialists
and
republicans
no
one
are
there
any
wounded
yes
and
dead
a
gloomy
silence
followed
i
rose
you
have
no
doubt
some
measures
to
take
i
said
what
measures
answered
lamartine
this
morning
we
resolved
to
decree
what
you
have
already
been
able
to
do
on
a
small
scale
in
your
quarter
the
organization
of
the
citizen
s
national
guard
every
frenchman
a
soldier
as
well
as
a
voter
but
time
is
required
and
meanwhile
he
pointed
to
the
waves
and
eddies
of
heads
surging
on
the
square
outside
look
it
is
the
sea
a
boy
wearing
an
apron
entered
and
spoke
to
him
in
low
tones
ah
very
good
said
lamartine
it
is
my
luncheon
will
you
share
it
with
me
hugo
thanks
i
have
already
i
haven
t
and
i
am
dying
of
hunger
at
least
come
and
look
on
at
the
feast
i
will
let
you
go
he
showed
me
into
a
room
that
gave
on
to
an
interior
a
gentle
faced
young
man
who
was
writing
at
a
table
rose
and
was
about
to
withdraw
he
was
the
young
workman
whom
louis
blanc
had
had
attached
to
the
provisional
government
stay
where
you
are
albert
said
lamartine
i
have
nothing
of
a
private
nature
to
say
to
victor
we
saluted
each
other
albert
and
i
the
little
waiter
showed
lamartine
a
table
upon
which
were
some
mutton
cutlets
in
an
earthenware
dish
some
bread
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
the
whole
came
from
a
in
the
neighbourhood
well
exclaimed
lamartine
what
about
a
knife
and
fork
i
thought
you
had
knives
and
forks
here
returned
the
boy
i
had
trouble
enough
to
bring
the
luncheon
and
if
i
have
got
to
go
and
fetch
knives
and
forks
pshaw
said
lamartine
one
must
take
things
as
they
come
he
broke
the
bread
took
a
cutlet
by
the
bone
and
tore
the
meat
with
his
teeth
when
he
had
finished
he
threw
the
bone
into
the
fireplace
in
this
manner
he
disposed
of
three
cutlets
and
drank
two
glasses
of
wine
you
will
agree
with
me
that
this
is
a
primitive
repast
he
said
but
it
is
an
improvement
on
our
supper
last
night
we
had
only
bread
and
cheese
among
us
and
we
all
drank
water
from
the
same
chipped
which
didn
t
it
appears
prevent
a
newspaper
this
morning
from
denouncing
the
great
orgy
of
the
provisional
government
i
did
not
find
victor
in
the
room
where
he
was
to
have
waited
for
me
i
supposed
that
having
become
tired
of
waiting
he
had
returned
home
alone
when
i
issued
on
to
the
place
de
grève
the
crowd
was
still
excited
and
in
a
state
of
consternation
at
the
inexplicable
collision
that
had
occurred
an
hour
before
the
body
of
a
wounded
man
who
had
just
expired
was
carried
past
me
they
told
me
that
it
was
the
fifth
it
was
taken
as
the
other
bodies
had
been
taken
to
the
salle
saint
jean
where
the
dead
of
the
previous
day
to
the
number
of
over
a
hundred
had
been
exposed
before
returning
to
the
place
royale
i
made
a
tour
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
our
outside
the
minimes
barracks
a
boy
of
about
fifteen
years
armed
with
the
rifle
of
a
soldier
of
the
line
was
proudly
mounting
guard
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
seen
him
there
in
the
morning
or
the
day
before
what
i
said
are
you
doing
sentry
duty
again
no
not
again
i
haven
t
yet
been
you
don
t
say
so
why
how
long
have
you
been
here
oh
about
seventeen
hours
what
haven
t
you
slept
haven
t
you
eaten
yes
i
have
had
something
to
you
went
to
get
it
of
course
no
i
didn
t
a
sentry
does
not
quit
his
post
this
morning
i
shouted
to
the
people
in
the
shop
across
the
way
that
i
was
hungry
and
they
brought
me
some
i
hastened
to
have
the
brave
child
relieved
from
duty
on
arriving
in
the
place
royale
i
inquired
for
victor
he
had
not
returned
i
was
seized
with
a
shudder
of
fear
i
do
not
know
why
the
vision
of
the
dead
who
had
been
transported
to
the
salle
saint
jean
should
have
come
into
my
mind
what
if
my
victor
had
been
caught
in
that
bloody
affray
i
gave
some
pretext
for
going
out
again
vacquerie
was
there
i
told
him
of
my
anguish
in
a
whisper
and
he
offered
to
accompany
me
first
of
all
we
called
upon
whose
establishment
was
in
the
rue
lobau
next
to
the
hotel
de
ville
and
i
asked
him
to
have
me
admitted
to
the
salle
saint
jean
at
first
he
sought
to
dissuade
me
from
seeing
the
hideous
sight
he
had
seen
it
the
previous
day
and
was
still
under
the
impression
of
the
horror
it
inspired
i
fancied
his
reluctance
was
a
bad
sign
that
he
was
trying
to
keep
something
from
me
this
made
me
insist
the
more
and
we
went
in
the
large
salle
saint
jean
transformed
into
a
vast
morgue
lay
the
long
line
of
corpses
upon
camp
bedsteads
for
the
most
part
they
were
unrecognisable
and
i
held
the
dreadful
review
quaking
in
my
shoes
when
one
of
the
dead
was
young
and
slim
with
chestnut
hair
yes
the
spectacle
of
the
poor
dead
was
horrible
indeed
but
i
could
not
describe
it
all
that
i
saw
of
each
body
was
that
it
was
not
that
of
my
child
at
length
i
reached
the
last
one
and
breathed
freely
once
more
as
i
issued
from
the
lugubrious
place
i
saw
victor
very
much
alive
running
towards
me
when
he
heard
the
firing
he
had
left
the
room
where
he
was
waiting
for
me
and
not
being
able
to
find
his
way
back
had
been
to
see
a
friend
ii
expulsions
and
escapes
may
on
february
the
duke
and
duchess
decazes
were
literally
driven
from
the
luxembourg
and
by
whom
by
the
very
denizens
of
the
palace
all
employés
of
the
chamber
of
peers
all
appointed
by
the
grand
referendary
a
rumour
was
circulated
in
the
quarter
that
during
the
night
the
peers
would
commit
some
act
publish
a
proclamation
etc
the
entire
faubourg
saint
jacques
prepared
to
march
against
the
luxembourg
hence
great
terror
first
the
duke
and
duchess
were
begged
then
pressed
then
constrained
to
leave
the
palace
we
will
leave
we
do
not
know
where
to
go
let
us
pass
the
night
here
they
said
they
were
driven
out
they
slept
in
a
next
day
they
took
up
their
abode
at
rue
verneuil
decazes
was
very
a
week
before
he
had
undergone
an
operation
mme
decazes
bore
it
all
with
cheerfulness
and
courage
this
is
a
trait
of
character
that
women
often
display
in
trying
situations
brought
about
through
the
stupidity
of
men
the
ministers
escaped
but
not
without
difficulty
duchâtel
in
particular
had
a
great
fright
guizot
three
days
previously
had
quitted
the
hotel
des
capucines
and
installed
himself
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
he
lived
there
with
duchâtel
on
february
mm
duchâtel
and
guizot
were
about
to
sit
down
to
luncheon
when
an
usher
rushed
in
with
a
frightened
air
the
head
of
the
column
of
rioters
was
debouching
from
the
rue
de
bourgogne
the
two
ministers
left
the
table
and
managed
to
escape
just
in
time
by
way
of
the
garden
their
families
followed
them
duchâtel
s
young
wife
guizot
s
aged
mother
and
the
children
a
notable
thing
about
this
flight
was
that
the
luncheon
of
guizot
became
the
supper
of
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
the
republic
had
eaten
what
had
been
served
to
the
monarchy
meanwhile
the
fugitives
had
taken
the
rue
bellechasse
guizot
walked
first
giving
his
arm
to
mme
duchâtel
his
overcoat
was
buttoned
up
and
his
hat
as
usual
was
stuck
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
was
easily
recognisable
in
the
rue
mme
duchâtel
noticed
that
some
men
in
blouses
were
gazing
at
guizot
in
a
singular
manner
she
led
him
into
a
doorway
it
chanced
that
she
knew
the
doorkeeper
they
hid
guizot
in
an
empty
room
on
the
fifth
floor
here
guizot
passed
the
day
but
he
could
not
stay
there
one
of
his
friends
remembered
a
bookseller
a
great
admirer
of
guizot
who
in
better
days
had
often
declared
that
he
would
devote
himself
to
and
give
his
life
for
him
whom
he
called
a
great
man
and
that
he
only
hoped
the
opportunity
for
doing
so
might
present
itself
this
friend
called
upon
him
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
said
and
told
him
that
the
hour
had
come
the
brave
bookseller
did
not
fail
in
what
was
expected
of
him
he
placed
his
house
at
guizot
s
disposal
and
hid
him
there
for
ten
whole
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
eight
places
in
a
compartment
of
a
carriage
on
the
northern
railway
were
hired
guizot
made
his
way
to
the
station
at
nightfall
the
seven
persons
who
were
aiding
in
his
escape
entered
the
compartment
with
him
they
reached
lille
then
ostend
whence
guizot
crossed
over
to
england
duchâtel
s
escape
was
more
complicated
he
managed
to
secure
a
passport
as
an
agent
of
the
republic
on
a
mission
he
disguised
himself
dyed
his
put
on
blue
spectacles
and
left
paris
in
a
twice
he
was
stopped
by
national
guards
in
the
towns
through
which
he
passed
with
great
audacity
he
declared
that
he
would
hold
responsible
before
the
republic
those
who
delayed
him
on
his
mission
the
word
republic
produced
its
effect
they
allowed
the
minister
to
pass
the
republic
saved
duchâtel
in
this
way
he
reached
a
seaport
boulogne
i
think
believing
that
he
was
being
hotly
pursued
and
very
nervous
in
consequence
a
channel
steamer
was
going
to
england
he
went
on
board
at
night
he
was
installing
himself
for
the
voyage
when
he
was
informed
that
the
steamer
would
not
leave
that
night
he
thought
that
he
had
been
discovered
and
that
he
was
a
lost
man
the
steamer
had
merely
been
detained
by
the
english
consul
probably
to
facilitate
if
necessary
the
flight
of
louis
philippe
duchâtel
landed
again
and
spent
the
night
and
next
day
in
the
studio
of
a
woman
painter
who
was
devoted
to
him
then
he
embarked
on
another
steamer
he
went
below
at
once
and
concealed
himself
as
best
he
could
pending
the
departure
of
the
vessel
he
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
fearing
that
at
any
moment
he
might
be
recognised
and
seized
at
last
the
steamer
got
under
way
hardly
had
the
paddle
wheels
begun
to
revolve
however
when
shouts
of
stop
her
stop
her
were
raised
on
the
quay
and
on
the
boat
which
stopped
short
this
time
the
poor
devil
of
a
minister
thought
it
was
all
up
with
him
the
hubbub
was
caused
by
an
officer
of
the
national
guard
who
in
taking
leave
of
friends
had
lingered
too
long
on
deck
and
did
not
want
to
be
taken
to
england
against
his
will
when
he
found
that
the
vessel
had
cast
off
he
had
shouted
stop
her
and
his
family
on
the
quay
had
taken
up
the
shout
the
officer
was
put
ashore
and
the
steamer
finally
started
this
was
how
duchâtel
left
france
and
reached
england
iii
louis
philippe
in
exile
may
the
orleans
family
in
england
are
literally
in
poverty
they
are
at
table
and
drink
water
there
is
not
the
slightest
exaggeration
in
this
absolutely
all
they
have
to
live
upon
is
an
income
of
about
francs
made
up
as
follows
francs
a
year
from
naples
which
came
from
queen
marie
amélie
and
the
interest
on
a
sum
of
francs
which
louis
philippe
had
forgotten
under
the
following
circumstances
during
his
last
triumphal
voyage
made
in
october
with
the
prince
de
joinville
he
had
a
credit
of
francs
opened
for
him
with
a
london
banker
of
this
sum
he
spent
only
francs
he
was
greatly
amazed
and
very
agreeably
surprised
on
arriving
in
london
to
find
that
the
balance
of
the
francs
remained
at
his
disposal
vatout
is
with
the
royal
family
for
the
whole
of
them
there
are
but
three
servants
of
whom
one
and
one
only
accompanied
them
from
the
tuileries
in
this
state
of
destitution
they
demanded
of
paris
the
restitution
of
what
belongs
to
them
in
france
their
property
is
under
seizure
and
has
remained
so
notwithstanding
their
reclamations
for
different
reasons
one
of
the
motives
put
forward
by
the
provisional
government
is
the
debt
of
the
civil
list
which
amounts
to
thirty
millions
queer
ideas
about
louis
philippe
were
entertained
he
may
have
been
covetous
but
he
certainly
was
not
miserly
he
was
the
most
prodigal
the
most
extravagant
and
least
careful
of
men
he
had
debts
accounts
and
arrears
everywhere
he
owed
francs
to
a
to
his
market
gardener
he
owed
francs
consequently
none
of
the
seals
placed
on
the
property
could
be
broken
and
everything
is
held
to
secure
the
creditors
everything
even
to
the
personal
property
of
the
prince
and
princess
de
joinville
rentes
diamonds
even
to
a
sum
of
francs
which
belongs
in
her
own
right
to
the
duchess
d
orleans
all
that
the
royal
family
was
able
to
obtain
was
their
clothing
and
personal
effects
or
rather
what
could
be
found
of
these
three
long
tables
were
placed
in
the
theatre
of
the
tuileries
and
on
these
were
laid
out
all
that
the
revolutionists
of
february
had
turned
over
to
the
governor
of
the
tuileries
durand
it
formed
a
queer
medley
court
costumes
stained
and
torn
grand
cordons
of
the
legion
of
honour
that
had
been
trailed
through
the
mud
stars
of
foreign
orders
swords
diamond
crowns
pearl
necklaces
a
collar
of
the
golden
fleece
etc
each
legal
representative
of
the
princes
an
or
secretary
took
what
he
recognised
it
appears
that
on
the
whole
little
was
recovered
the
duke
de
nemours
merely
asked
for
some
linen
and
in
particular
his
shoes
the
prince
de
joinville
meeting
the
duke
de
montpensier
greeted
him
thus
ah
here
you
are
monsieur
you
were
not
killed
you
have
not
had
good
luck
gudin
the
marine
painter
who
went
to
england
saw
louis
philippe
the
king
is
greatly
depressed
he
said
to
gudin
i
don
t
understand
it
what
happened
in
paris
what
did
the
parisians
get
into
their
heads
i
haven
t
any
idea
one
of
these
days
they
will
recognise
that
i
did
not
do
one
thing
he
did
not
indeed
do
one
thing
wrong
he
did
all
things
wrong
he
had
in
fact
reached
an
incredible
degree
of
optimism
he
believed
himself
to
be
more
of
a
king
than
louis
xiv
and
more
of
an
emperor
than
napoleon
on
tuesday
the
he
was
exuberantly
gay
and
was
still
occupied
solely
with
his
own
affairs
and
these
of
the
pettiest
character
at
o
clock
when
the
first
shots
were
being
fired
he
was
conferring
with
his
lawyers
and
business
agents
mm
de
gérante
scribe
and
denormandie
as
to
what
could
best
be
done
about
madame
adelaide
s
will
on
wednesday
at
o
clock
when
the
national
guard
was
declaring
against
the
government
which
meant
revolution
the
king
sent
for
hersent
to
order
of
him
a
picture
of
some
kind
charles
was
a
lynx
louis
philippe
in
england
however
bears
his
misfortune
worthily
the
english
aristocracy
acted
nobly
eight
or
ten
of
the
wealthiest
peers
wrote
to
louis
philippe
to
offer
him
their
châteaux
and
their
purses
the
king
replied
i
accept
and
keep
only
your
the
duchess
d
orleans
is
also
in
straitened
circumstances
she
is
on
bad
terms
with
the
d
orleans
family
and
the
mecklenburg
family
is
on
bad
terms
with
her
on
the
one
hand
she
will
accept
nothing
and
on
the
other
she
can
expect
nothing
at
this
time
of
writing
may
the
tuileries
have
already
been
repaired
and
empis
remarked
to
me
this
morning
they
are
going
to
clean
up
and
nothing
of
the
damage
done
will
be
neuilly
and
the
however
have
been
devastated
the
picture
gallery
of
the
a
pretty
poor
one
by
the
by
has
practically
been
destroyed
only
a
single
picture
remains
perfectly
intact
and
that
is
the
portrait
of
philippe
egalité
was
it
purposely
respected
by
the
riot
or
is
its
preservation
an
irony
of
chance
the
national
guards
amused
and
still
amuse
themselves
by
cutting
out
of
the
canvases
that
were
not
entirely
destroyed
by
fire
faces
to
which
they
take
a
fancy
iv
king
jerome
there
entered
my
in
the
place
royale
one
morning
in
march
a
man
of
medium
height
about
or
years
of
age
dressed
in
black
a
red
and
blue
ribbon
in
his
buttonhole
and
wearing
boots
and
white
gloves
he
was
jerome
napoleon
king
of
westphalia
he
had
a
very
gentle
voice
a
charming
though
somewhat
timid
smile
straight
hair
turning
grey
and
something
of
the
profile
of
the
emperor
he
came
to
thank
me
for
the
permission
that
had
been
accorded
to
him
to
return
to
france
which
he
attributed
to
me
and
begged
me
to
get
him
appointed
governor
of
the
invalides
he
told
me
that
crémieux
one
of
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
had
said
to
him
the
previous
day
if
victor
hugo
asks
lamartine
to
do
it
it
will
be
done
formerly
everything
depended
upon
an
interview
between
two
emperors
now
everything
depends
upon
an
interview
between
two
tell
crémieux
that
it
is
he
who
is
the
poet
i
replied
to
king
jerome
with
a
smile
in
november
the
king
of
westphalia
lived
on
the
first
floor
above
the
entresol
at
no
rue
d
alger
it
was
a
small
apartment
with
mahogany
furniture
and
woollen
velvet
upholstering
the
wall
paper
of
the
was
grey
the
room
was
lighted
by
two
lamps
and
ornamented
by
a
heavy
clock
in
the
empire
style
and
two
not
very
authentic
pictures
although
the
frame
of
one
bore
the
name
titiens
and
the
frame
of
the
other
the
name
on
the
mantelpiece
was
a
bronze
bust
of
napoleon
one
of
those
familiar
and
inevitable
busts
that
the
empire
bequeathed
us
the
only
vestiges
of
his
royal
existence
that
remained
to
the
prince
were
his
silverware
and
dinner
service
which
were
ornamented
with
royal
crowns
richly
engraved
and
gilded
jerome
at
that
time
was
only
years
old
and
did
not
look
his
age
his
eyes
were
bright
his
smile
benevolent
and
charming
and
his
hands
small
and
still
shapely
he
was
habitually
attired
in
black
with
a
gold
chain
in
his
buttonhole
from
which
hung
three
crosses
the
legion
of
honour
the
iron
crown
and
his
order
of
westphalia
created
by
him
in
imitation
of
the
iron
crown
jerome
talked
well
with
grace
always
and
often
with
wit
he
was
full
of
reminiscences
and
spoke
of
the
emperor
with
a
mingled
respect
and
affection
that
was
touching
a
little
vanity
was
perceptible
i
would
have
preferred
pride
moreover
he
received
with
bonhomie
all
the
varied
qualifications
which
were
brought
upon
him
by
his
strange
position
of
a
man
who
was
no
longer
king
no
longer
proscribed
and
yet
was
not
a
citizen
everybody
addressed
him
as
he
pleased
louis
philippe
called
him
highness
boulay
de
la
meurthe
sire
or
your
majesty
alexandre
dumas
monseigneur
i
addressed
him
as
prince
and
my
wife
called
him
on
his
card
he
wrote
general
in
his
place
i
would
have
understood
his
position
king
or
nothing
related
by
king
jerome
in
the
evening
of
the
day
following
that
on
which
jerome
recalled
from
exile
returned
to
paris
he
had
vainly
waited
for
his
secretary
and
feeling
bored
and
lonely
went
out
it
was
at
the
end
of
summer
he
was
staying
at
the
house
of
his
daughter
princess
demidoff
which
was
off
the
he
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
looking
about
him
at
the
statues
obelisk
and
fountains
which
were
new
to
the
exile
who
had
not
seen
paris
for
years
he
continued
along
the
quai
des
tuileries
i
know
not
what
reverie
took
possession
of
his
soul
arrived
at
the
pavillon
de
flore
he
entered
the
gate
turned
to
the
left
and
began
to
walk
up
a
flight
of
stairs
under
the
arch
he
had
gone
up
two
or
three
steps
when
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
arm
it
was
the
gatekeeper
who
had
run
after
him
hi
monsieur
monsieur
where
are
you
going
jerome
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
and
replied
why
to
my
apartments
of
course
hardly
had
he
uttered
the
words
however
when
he
awoke
from
his
dream
the
past
had
bewitched
him
for
a
moment
in
recounting
the
incident
to
me
he
said
i
went
away
shamefacedly
and
apologizing
to
the
the
days
of
june
miscellaneous
notes
the
insurrection
of
june
presented
peculiar
features
from
the
outset
it
suddenly
manifested
itself
to
terrified
society
in
monstrous
and
unknown
forms
at
the
end
of
june
four
months
after
the
proclamation
of
the
republic
regular
work
had
come
to
a
standstill
and
the
useless
workshops
known
as
the
national
workshops
had
been
abolished
by
the
national
assembly
then
the
widespread
distress
prevailing
caused
the
outbreak
of
one
of
the
most
formidable
insurrections
recorded
in
history
the
power
at
that
time
was
in
the
hands
of
an
executive
committee
of
five
members
lamartine
arago
ledru
rollin
and
marie
general
cavaignac
was
minister
of
war
the
first
barricade
was
erected
in
the
morning
of
friday
the
at
the
porte
saint
denis
it
was
attacked
the
same
day
the
national
guard
marched
resolutely
against
it
the
attacking
force
was
made
up
of
battalions
of
the
first
and
second
legions
which
arrived
by
way
of
the
boulevards
when
the
assailants
got
within
range
a
formidable
volley
was
fired
from
the
barricade
and
littered
the
ground
with
national
guards
the
national
guard
more
irritated
than
intimidated
charged
the
barricade
at
this
juncture
a
woman
appeared
upon
its
crest
a
woman
young
handsome
dishevelled
terrible
this
woman
who
was
a
prostitute
pulled
up
her
clothes
to
her
waist
and
screamed
to
the
guards
in
that
frightful
language
of
the
lupanar
that
one
is
always
compelled
to
translate
cowards
fire
if
you
dare
at
the
belly
of
a
woman
here
the
affair
became
appalling
the
national
guard
did
not
hesitate
a
volley
brought
the
wretched
creature
down
and
with
a
piercing
shriek
she
toppled
off
the
barricade
a
silence
of
horror
fell
alike
upon
besiegers
and
besieged
suddenly
another
woman
appeared
this
one
was
even
younger
and
more
beautiful
she
was
almost
a
child
being
barely
seventeen
years
of
age
oh
the
pity
of
it
she
too
was
a
like
the
other
she
lifted
her
skirt
disclosed
her
abdomen
and
screamed

fired
and
riddled
with
bullets
she
fell
upon
the
body
of
her
sister
in
vice
it
was
thus
that
the
war
commenced
nothing
could
be
more
chilling
and
more
sombre
it
is
a
hideous
thing
this
heroism
of
abjection
in
which
bursts
forth
all
that
weakness
has
of
strength
this
civilization
attacked
by
cynicism
and
defending
itself
by
barbarity
on
one
side
the
despair
of
the
people
on
the
other
the
despair
of
society
on
saturday
the
at
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
as
a
representative
of
the
people
was
at
the
barricade
in
the
place
baudoyer
that
was
defended
by
the
troops
the
barricade
was
a
low
one
another
narrow
and
high
protected
it
in
the
street
the
sun
shone
upon
and
brightened
the
the
tortuous
rue
saint
antoine
wound
before
us
in
sinister
solitude
the
soldiers
were
lying
upon
the
barricade
which
was
little
more
than
three
feet
high
their
rifles
were
stacked
between
the
projecting
as
though
in
a
rack
now
and
then
bullets
whistled
overhead
and
struck
the
walls
of
the
houses
around
us
bringing
down
a
shower
of
stone
and
plaster
occasionally
a
blouse
sometimes
a
head
appeared
at
the
corner
of
a
street
the
soldiers
promptly
fired
at
it
when
they
hit
their
mark
they
applauded
good
well
aimed
capital
they
laughed
and
chatted
gaily
at
intervals
there
was
a
rattle
and
roar
and
a
hail
of
bullets
rained
upon
the
barricade
from
roofs
and
windows
a
very
tall
captain
with
a
grey
moustache
stood
erect
at
the
centre
of
the
barrier
above
which
half
his
body
towered
the
bullets
pattered
about
him
as
about
a
target
he
was
impassible
and
serene
and
spoke
to
his
men
in
this
wise
there

are

all
at
once
a
woman
turned
the
corner
of
a
street
she
came
leisurely
towards
the
barricade
the
soldiers
swore
and
shouted
to
her
to
get
out
of
the
way
ah

strumpet

of
that

a
woman
after
advancing
about
twenty
paces
the
woman
who
really
did
seem
to
be
observing
us
entered
a
low
door
which
closed
behind
her
this
one
was
saved
at
o
clock
i
returned
from
the
barrier
in
the
place
baudoyer
and
took
my
usual
place
in
the
assembly
a
representative
whom
i
did
not
know
but
who
i
have
since
learned
was
belley
engineer
residing
in
the
rue
des
tournelles

been
burned

set
fire
to
your
house
the
insurgents

by
the
little
door
in
the

my
family
i
inquired

how
do
you
know
i
have
just
come
from
there
not
being
known
i
was
able
to
get
over
the
barricades
and
make
my
way
here
your
family
first
took
refuge
in
the
mairie
i
was
there
too
seeing
that
the
danger
was
over
i
advised
mme
victor
hugo
to
seek
some
other
asylum
she
found
shelter
with
her
children
in
the
home
of
a
named
martignon
who
lives
near
your
house
under
the
i
knew
that
worthy
martignon
family
this
reassured
me
and
how
about
the
riot
i
asked
it
is
a
revolution
replied
belley
the
insurgents
are
in
control
of
paris
at
this
i
left
belley
and
hurriedly
traversed
the
few
rooms
that
separated
the
hall
in
which
we
held
our
sessions
and
the
office
occupied
by
the
executive
committee
it
was
a
small
salon
belonging
to
the
presidency
and
was
reached
through
two
rooms
that
were
smaller
still
in
these
was
a
buzzing
crowd
of
distracted
officers
and
national
guards
they
made
no
attempt
to
prevent
any
one
from
entering
i
opened
the
door
of
the
executive
committee
s
office
very
red
was
half
seated
on
the
table
very
pale
and
half
reclining
in
an
armchair
formed
an
antithesis
to
him
the
contrast
was
complete
thin
and
stout
and
two
or
three
colonels
among
them
representative
charras
were
conversing
in
a
corner
i
only
recall
arago
vaguely
i
do
not
remember
whether
marie
was
there
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
lamartine
standing
in
a
window
recess
on
the
left
was
talking
to
a
general
in
full
uniform
whom
i
saw
for
the
first
and
last
time
and
who
was
négrier
négrier
was
killed
that
same
evening
in
front
of
a
barricade
i
hurried
to
lamartine
who
advanced
to
meet
me
he
was
wan
and
agitated
his
beard
was
long
his
clothes
were
dusty
he
held
out
his
hand
ah
good
morning
hugo
here
is
the
dialogue
that
we
engaged
in
every
word
of
which
is
still
fresh
in
my
memory
what
is
the
situation
lamartine
we
are
done
for
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
now
the
assembly
will
be
even
at
that
moment
a
column
of
insurgents
was
coming
down
the
rue
de
lille
a
timely
charge
of
cavalry
dispersed
it
nonsense
what
about
the
troops
there
are
no
troops
but
you
said
on
wednesday
and
yesterday
repeated
that
you
had
sixty
thousand
men
at
your
so
i
well
but
you
musn
t
give
up
like
this
it
is
not
only
you
who
are
at
stake
but
the
assembly
and
not
only
the
assembly
but
france
and
not
only
france
but
the
whole
of
civilization
why
did
you
not
issue
orders
yesterday
to
have
the
garrisons
of
the
towns
for
forty
leagues
round
brought
to
paris
that
would
have
given
you
thirty
thousand
men
at
we
gave
the
orders
well
the
troops
have
not
come
lamartine
took
my
hand
and
said
i
am
not
minister
of
war
at
this
moment
a
few
representatives
entered
noisily
the
assembly
had
just
voted
a
state
of
siege
they
told
and
so
in
a
few
words
lamartine
half
turned
towards
them
and
said
in
an
undertone
a
state
of
siege
a
state
of
siege
well
declare
it
if
you
think
it
is
necessary
i
have
nothing
to
say
he
dropped
into
a
chair
repeating
i
have
nothing
to
say
neither
yes
nor
no
do
what
you
like
general
négrier
came
up
to
me
monsieur
victor
hugo
he
said
i
have
come
to
reassure
you
i
have
received
news
from
the
place
well
general
your
family
are
thanks
yes
i
have
just
been
so
but
your
house
has
been
burnt
what
does
that
matter
said
négrier
warmly
pressed
my
arm
i
understand
you
let
us
think
only
of
one
thing
let
us
save
the
country
as
i
was
withdrawing
lamartine
quitted
a
group
and
came
to
me
adieu
he
said
but
do
not
forget
this
do
not
judge
me
too
hastily
i
am
not
the
minister
of
the
day
before
as
the
riot
was
spreading
cavaignac
after
a
few
measures
had
been
taken
said
to
lamartine
that
s
enough
for
it
was
o
clock
what
exclaimed
lamartine
why
we
have
still
four
hours
of
daylight
before
us
and
the
riot
will
profit
by
them
while
we
are
losing
them
he
could
get
nothing
from
cavaignac
except
that
s
enough
for
on
the
about
o
clock
at
the
most
critical
moment
a
representative
of
the
people
wearing
his
sail
across
his
shoulder
arrived
at
the
mairie
of
the
second
arrondissement
in
the
rue
chauchat
behind
the
opera
he
was
recognised
he
was
lagrange
the
national
guards
surrounded
him
in
a
twinkling
the
group
became
menacing
it
is
lagrange
the
man
of
the
pistol
shot
what
are
you
doing
here
you
are
a
coward
get
behind
the
barricades
that
is
your
place
your
friends
are
there
and
not
with
us
they
will
proclaim
you
their
chief
go
on
they
at
any
rate
are
brave
they
are
giving
their
blood
for
your
follies
and
you
you
are
afraid
you
have
a
dirty
duty
to
do
but
at
least
do
it
get
out
of
here
begone
it
was
popularly
but
erroneously
believed
that
lagrange
fired
the
shot
that
led
to
the
massacre
in
the
boulevard
des
capucines
on
february
lagrange
endeavoured
to
speak
his
voice
was
drowned
by
hooting
this
is
how
these
madmen
received
the
honest
man
who
after
fighting
for
the
people
wanted
to
risk
his
life
for
society
june
the
insurgents
were
firing
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
boulevard
beaumarchais
from
the
tops
of
the
new
houses
several
had
ambushed
themselves
in
the
big
house
in
course
of
construction
opposite
the
galiote
at
the
windows
they
had
stuck
dummies
bundles
of
straw
with
blouses
and
caps
on
them
i
distinctly
saw
a
man
who
had
entrenched
himself
behind
a
barricade
of
bricks
in
a
corner
of
the
balcony
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
house
which
faces
the
rue
du
the
man
took
careful
aim
and
killed
a
good
many
persons
it
was
o
clock
the
troops
and
mobiles
fringed
the
roofs
of
the
boulevard
du
temple
and
returned
the
fire
of
the
insurgents
a
cannon
had
just
been
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
gaité
to
demolish
the
house
of
the
galiote
and
sweep
the
whole
boulevard
i
thought
i
ought
to
make
an
effort
to
put
a
stop
to
the
bloodshed
if
possible
and
advanced
to
the
corner
of
the
rue
d
angoulême
when
i
reached
the
little
turret
near
there
i
was
greeted
with
a
fusillade
the
bullets
pattered
upon
the
turret
behind
me
and
ploughed
up
the
playbills
with
which
it
was
covered
i
detached
a
strip
of
paper
as
a
memento
the
bill
to
which
it
belonged
announced
for
that
very
sunday
a
fête
at
the
château
des
flours
with
a
thousand
for
four
months
we
have
been
living
in
a
furnace
what
consoles
me
is
that
the
statue
of
the
future
will
issue
from
it
it
required
such
a
brazier
to
melt
such
a
bronze
vi
chateaubriand
july
chateaubriand
is
dead
one
of
the
splendours
of
this
century
has
passed
away
he
was
years
old
according
to
his
own
reckoning
according
to
the
calculation
of
his
old
friend
bertin
senior
he
was
eighty
years
of
age
but
he
had
a
weakness
said
bertin
and
that
was
that
he
insisted
that
he
was
born
not
in
but
in
because
that
was
the
year
of
napoleon
s
birth
he
died
yesterday
july
at
o
clock
in
the
morning
for
five
or
six
months
he
had
been
suffering
from
paralysis
which
had
almost
destroyed
his
brain
and
for
five
days
from
inflammation
of
the
lungs
which
abruptly
snuffed
out
his
life
ampere
announced
the
news
to
the
academy
which
thereupon
decided
to
adjourn
i
quitted
the
national
assembly
where
a
questor
to
succeed
general
négrier
who
was
killed
in
june
was
being
nominated
and
went
to
de
chateaubriand
s
house
no
rue
du
bac
i
was
received
by
de
preuille
of
his
nephew
i
entered
chateaubriand
s
chamber
he
was
lying
upon
his
bed
a
little
iron
bedstead
with
white
curtains
round
it
and
surmounted
by
an
iron
curtain
ring
of
somewhat
doubtful
taste
the
face
was
uncovered
the
brow
the
nose
the
closed
eyes
bore
that
expression
of
nobleness
which
had
marked
him
in
life
and
which
was
enhanced
by
the
grave
majesty
of
death
the
mouth
and
chin
were
hidden
by
a
cambric
handkerchief
on
his
head
was
a
white
cotton
nightcap
which
however
allowed
the
grey
hair
on
his
temples
to
be
seen
a
white
cravat
rose
to
his
ears
his
tawny
visage
appeared
more
severe
amid
all
this
whiteness
beneath
the
sheet
his
narrow
hollow
chest
and
his
thin
legs
could
be
discerned
the
shutters
of
the
windows
giving
on
to
the
garden
were
closed
a
little
daylight
entered
through
the
door
of
the
salon
the
chamber
and
the
face
were
illumined
by
four
tapers
which
burned
at
the
corners
of
a
table
placed
near
the
bed
on
this
table
were
a
silver
crucifix
a
vase
filled
with
holy
water
and
an
aspergillum
beside
it
a
priest
was
praying
behind
the
priest
a
large
screen
hid
the
fireplace
above
which
the
and
a
few
engravings
of
churches
and
cathedrals
were
visible
at
chateaubriand
s
feet
in
the
angle
formed
by
the
bed
and
the
wall
of
the
room
were
two
wooden
boxes
placed
one
upon
the
other
the
largest
i
was
told
contained
the
complete
manuscript
of
his
memoirs
in
copybooks
towards
the
last
there
had
been
such
disorder
in
the
house
that
one
of
the
copybooks
had
been
found
that
very
morning
by
de
preuille
in
a
dark
and
dirty
closet
where
the
lamps
were
cleaned
a
few
tables
a
wardrobe
and
a
few
blue
and
green
armchairs
in
disorder
encumbered
more
than
they
furnished
the
room
the
adjoining
salon
the
furniture
of
which
was
hidden
under
unbleached
covers
contained
nothing
more
remarkable
than
a
marble
bust
of
henry
and
a
statuette
of
chateaubriand
which
were
on
the
mantelpiece
and
on
each
side
of
a
window
plaster
busts
of
mme
de
berri
and
her
infant
child
towards
the
close
of
his
life
chateaubriand
was
almost
in
his
second
childhood
his
mind
was
only
lucid
for
about
two
or
three
hours
a
day
at
least
so
pilorge
his
former
secretary
told
me
when
in
february
he
was
apprised
of
the
proclamation
of
the
republic
he
merely
remarked
will
you
be
any
the
happier
for
it
when
his
wife
died
he
attended
the
funeral
service
and
returned
laughing
heartily
which
said
pilorge
was
a
proof
that
he
was
of
weak
mind
a
proof
that
he
was
in
his
right
mind
affirmed
edouard
bertin
mme
de
chateaubriand
s
benevolence
was
official
which
did
not
prevent
her
from
being
a
shrew
at
home
she
founded
a
hospice
the
marie
thérèse
infirmary
visited
the
poor
succoured
the
sick
superintended
crêches
gave
alms
and
prayed
at
the
same
time
she
was
harsh
towards
her
husband
her
relatives
her
friends
and
her
servants
and
was
stern
prudish
and
a
backbiter
god
on
high
will
take
these
things
into
account
she
was
ugly
pitted
with
had
an
enormous
mouth
little
eyes
was
insignificant
in
appearance
and
acted
the
although
she
was
rather
the
wife
of
a
great
man
than
of
a
great
lord
by
birth
she
was
only
the
daughter
of
a
of
saint
malo
de
chateaubriand
feared
detested
and
cajoled
her
she
took
advantage
of
this
to
make
herself
insupportable
to
mere
human
beings
i
have
never
known
anybody
less
approachable
or
whose
reception
of
callers
was
more
forbidding
i
was
a
youth
when
i
went
to
de
chateaubriand
s
she
received
me
very
badly
or
rather
she
did
not
receive
me
at
all
i
entered
and
bowed
but
mme
de
chateaubriand
did
not
see
me
i
was
scared
out
of
my
wits
these
terrors
made
my
visits
to
de
chateaubriand
veritable
nightmares
which
oppressed
me
for
fifteen
days
and
fifteen
nights
in
advance
mme
de
chateaubriand
hated
whoever
visited
her
husband
except
through
the
doors
that
she
opened
she
had
not
presented
me
to
him
therefore
she
hated
me
i
was
perfectly
odious
to
her
and
she
showed
it
only
once
in
my
life
and
in
hers
did
mme
de
chateaubriand
receive
me
graciously
one
day
i
entered
poor
little
devil
as
usual
most
unhappy
with
affrighted
schoolboy
air
and
twisting
my
hat
about
in
my
hands
de
chateaubriand
at
that
time
still
lived
at
no
rue
saint
dominique
i
was
frightened
at
everything
there
even
at
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
well
i
entered
mme
de
chateaubriand
was
in
the
salon
leading
to
her
husband
s
study
it
was
a
summer
morning
there
was
a
ray
of
sunshine
on
the
floor
and
what
dazzled
and
astonished
me
much
more
than
the
ray
of
sunshine
was
a
smile
on
mme
de
chateaubriand
s
face
is
that
you

she
said
i
thought
i
was
in
the
midst
of
a
dream
of
the
mme
de
chateaubriand
smiling
mme
de
chateaubriand
knowing
my
name
addressing
me
by
name
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
deigned
to
notice
my
existence
i
bowed
so
low
that
my
head
nearly
touched
the
floor
she
went
on
i
am
delighted
to
see
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
i
was
expecting
you
she
continued
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
i
thought
then
that
there
certainly
must
be
something
the
matter
either
with
her
or
myself
however
she
pointed
to
a
rather
large
object
of
some
kind
on
a
little
table
and
added
i
reserved
this
for
you
i
felt
sure
you
would
like
to
have
it
you
know
what
it
is
it
was
a
pile
of
packets
of
chocolate
made
by
some
religious
institution
she
had
taken
the
stuff
under
her
protection
and
the
proceeds
of
its
sale
were
to
be
devoted
to
charitable
works
i
took
it
and
paid
for
it
at
that
time
i
had
to
live
for
fifteen
months
on
francs
the
catholic
chocolate
and
mme
de
chateaubriand
s
smile
cost
me
francs
that
is
to
say
a
fortnight
s
board
fifteen
francs
meant
as
much
to
me
then
as
francs
does
now
it
was
the
most
costly
smile
of
a
woman
that
ever
was
sold
to
me
de
chateaubriand
at
the
beginning
of

a
paralytic
mme
récamier
was
blind
every
day
at
o
clock
de
chateaubriand
was
carried
to
mme
recamier
s
bedside
it
was
touching
and
sad
the
woman
who
could
no
longer
see
stretched
forth
her
hands
gropingly
towards
the
man
who
could
no
longer
feel
their
hands

life
was
dying
but
love
still
lived
vii
debates
in
the
national
assembly
on
the
days
of
june
session
of
november
what
had
to
be
determined
before
the
assembly
and
the
country
was
upon
whom
devolved
the
heavy
responsibility
for
the
painful
days
of
june
the
executive
committee
was
then
in
power
ought
it
not
to
have
foreseen
and
provided
against
the
insurrection
general
cavaignac
minister
of
war
and
moreover
invested
with
dictatorial
powers
by
the
national
assembly
had
alone
issued
orders
had
he
issued
them
in
time
could
he
not
have
crushed
the
riot
at
the
outset
instead
of
permitting
it
to
gain
strength
spread
and
develop
into
an
insurrection
and
finally
had
not
the
repression
which
followed
victory
been
unnecessarily
bloody
if
not
inhuman
as
the
time
for
rendering
an
account
approached
cavaignac
became
thoughtful
and
his
was
manifest
even
in
the
chamber
one
day
crémieux
took
his
seat
on
the
ministerial
bench
whence
he
approved
with
an
occasional
hear
hear
the
remarks
of
the
orator
who
occupied
the
tribune
the
speaker
chanced
to
belong
to
the
opposition
monsieur
crémieux
said
cavaignac
you
are
making
a
good
deal
of
what
does
that
matter
to
you
replied
crémieux
it
matters
that
you
are
on
the
ministerial
do
you
want
me
to
leave
it
well
cremieux
rose
and
quitted
his
bench
saying
as
he
did
so
general
you
compel
me
to
leave
the
cabinet
and
it
was
through
me
that
you
entered
crémieux
in
point
of
fact
had
as
a
member
of
the
provisional
government
had
cavaignac
appointed
minister
of
war
during
the
three
days
that
preceded
the
debate
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
the
chamber
was
very
nervous
and
uneasy
cavaignac
s
friends
secretly
trembled
and
sought
to
make
others
tremble
they
said
you
will
see
they
affected
assurance
jules
favre
having
alluded
in
the
tribune
to
the
great
and
solemn
debate
which
was
to
take
place
they
burst
into
a
laugh
coquerel
the
protestant
pastor
happening
to
meet
cavaignac
in
the
lobby
said
to
him
keep
yourself
in
hand
general
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
replied
cavaignac
with
flashing
eyes
i
shall
have
swept
these
wretches
away
these
wretches
were
lamartine
and
arago
there
was
some
doubt
about
arago
however
it
was
said
that
he
was
rallying
to
cavaignac
meanwhile
cavaignac
had
conferred
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
upon
the
bishop
of
quimper
the
abbé
legraverand
who
had
accepted
it
a
cross
for
a
vote
was
the
remark
made
in
the
chamber
and
these
reversed
roles
a
general
giving
a
cross
to
a
bishop
caused
much
amusement
in
reality
we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
quarrel
over
the
presidency
the
candidates
are
shaking
their
fists
at
each
other
the
assembly
hoots
growls
murmurs
stamps
its
feet
crushes
one
applauds
the
other
this
poor
assembly
is
a
veritable
a
in
love
with
a
trooper
for
the
time
being
it
is
cavaignac
who
will
it
be
general
cavaignac
proved
himself
to
be
clever
and
occasionally
even
eloquent
his
defence
partook
more
of
the
character
of
an
attack
frequently
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
sincere
because
he
had
for
so
long
excited
my
suspicion
the
assembly
listened
to
him
for
nearly
three
hours
with
rapt
attention
throughout
it
was
evident
that
he
possessed
its
confidence
its
sympathy
was
shown
every
moment
and
sometimes
it
manifested
a
sort
of
love
for
him
cavaignac
tall
and
supple
with
his
short
his
military
collar
his
heavy
moustache
his
bent
brow
his
brusque
language
broken
up
by
parentheses
and
his
rough
gestures
was
at
times
at
once
as
fierce
as
a
soldier
and
as
passionate
as
a
tribune
towards
the
middle
of
his
discourse
he
became
an
advocate
which
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
spoiled
the
man
the
harangue
became
a
speech
for
the
defence
but
at
its
conclusion
he
roused
himself
again
with
a
sort
of
real
indignation
he
pounded
on
the
desk
with
his
fist
and
overturned
the
glass
of
water
much
to
the
consternation
of
the
ushers
and
in
terminating
he
said
i
have
been
speaking
for
i
know
not
how
long
i
will
speak
again
all
the
evening
all
night
all
day
if
necessary
and
it
will
no
longer
be
as
an
advocate
but
as
a
soldier
and
you
will
listen
to
me
the
whole
assembly
applauded
him
enthusiastically
barthélemy
saint
hilaire
who
attacked
cavaignac
was
an
orator
cold
rigid
somewhat
dry
and
by
no
means
equal
to
the
task
his
anger
being
without
fierceness
and
his
hatred
without
passion
he
began
by
reading
a
memoir
which
always
displeases
assemblies
the
assembly
which
was
secretly
and
angry
was
eager
to
crush
him
it
only
wanted
pretexts
he
furnished
it
with
motives
the
grave
defect
in
his
memoir
was
that
serious
accusations
were
built
upon
petty
acts
a
surcharge
that
caused
the
whole
system
to
bend
this
little
pallid
man
who
continually
raised
one
leg
behind
him
and
leaned
forward
with
his
two
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
tribune
as
though
he
were
gazing
down
into
a
well
made
those
who
did
not
hiss
laugh
amid
the
uproar
of
the
assembly
he
affected
to
write
at
considerable
length
in
a
copybook
to
dry
the
ink
by
sprinkling
powder
upon
it
and
with
great
deliberation
to
pour
the
powder
back
into
the
thus
finding
means
to
increase
the
tumult
with
his
calmness
when
barthélemy
saint
hilaire
descended
from
the
tribune
cavaignac
had
only
been
attacked
he
had
not
then
replied
yet
was
already
absolved
tried
republican
and
honest
man
but
with
a
substratum
of
vanity
and
an
emphatic
manner
succeeded
barthélemy
saint
hilaire
the
assembly
tried
to
crush
him
too
but
he
rose
again
amid
murmurs
he
reminded
his
hearers
of
his
past
invoked
recollections
of
the
salle
voisin
compared
the
henchmen
of
cavaignac
to
the
henchmen
of
guizot
bared
his
breast
which
had
braved
the
poignards
of
the
red
republic
and
ended
by
resolutely
attacking
the
general
with
too
few
facts
and
too
many
words
but
fairly
and
squarely
taking
him
so
to
speak
as
the
bible
urges
that
the
bull
be
taken
by
the
horns
propped
up
the
accusation
that
had
almost
been
laid
low
he
brought
the
personal
pronoun
much
too
frequently
into
the
discussion
he
acted
for
everybody
s
personality
ought
to
have
been
effaced
in
view
of
the
seriousness
of
the
debate
and
the
anxiety
of
the
country
he
turned
to
all
sides
with
a
sort
of
disconsolate
fury
he
summoned
arago
to
intervene
to
speak
lamartine
to
explain
all
three
remained
silent
thus
failing
in
their
duty
and
destiny
the
assembly
however
pursued
with
its
hooting
and
when
he
said
to
cavaignac
you
wanted
to
throw
us
down
it
burst
into
a
laugh
at
the
sentiment
as
well
as
at
the
expression
gazed
at
the
laughing
house
with
an
air
of
despair
from
all
sides
came
shouts
of
the
closure
the
assembly
had
reached
a
state
in
which
it
would
not
listen
and
could
no
longer
hear
appeared
in
the
tribune
from
every
bench
the
cry
arose
at
last
silence
ensued
s
speech
had
a
physical
effect
as
it
were
it
was
coarse
but
powerful
had
pointed
out
the
general
s
political
shortcomings
pointed
out
his
military
shortcomings
with
the
vehemence
of
the
tribune
he
mingled
all
the
skill
of
the
advocate
he
concluded
with
an
appeal
for
mercy
for
the
offender
he
shook
cavaignac
s
position
when
he
resumed
his
seat
between
pierre
leroux
and
de
lamennais
a
man
with
long
grey
hair
and
attired
in
a
white
crossed
the
chamber
and
shook
s
hand
he
was
lagrange
cavaignac
for
the
fourth
time
ascended
the
tribune
it
was
half
past
o
clock
at
night
the
noise
of
the
crowd
and
the
evolutions
of
the
cavalry
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
could
be
heard
the
aspect
of
the
assembly
was
becoming
sinister
cavaignac
who
was
tired
had
decided
to
assume
a
haughty
attitude
he
addressed
the
mountain
and
defied
it
declaring
to
the
mountaineers
amid
the
cheers
of
the
majority
and
of
the
reactionaries
that
he
at
all
times
preferred
their
abuse
to
their
this
appeared
to
be
violent
and
was
clever
cavaignac
lost
the
rue
taitbout
which
represented
the
socialists
and
won
the
rue
de
poitiers
which
represented
the
conservatives
after
this
apostrophe
he
remained
a
few
moments
motionless
then
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
the
assembly
shouted
to
him
enough
enough
he
turned
towards
and
exclaimed
you
said
that
you
had
done
with
me
it
is
i
who
have
done
with
you
you
said
for
some
i
say
to
you
for
ever
it
was
all
over
the
assembly
wanted
to
close
the
debate
lagrange
ascended
the
tribune
and
gesticulated
amid
hoots
and
hisses
lagrange
was
at
once
a
popular
and
chivalrous
declaimer
who
expressed
true
sentiments
in
a
forced
voice
representatives
said
he
all
this
amuses
you
well
it
doesn
t
amuse
me
the
assembly
roared
with
laughter
and
the
roar
of
laughter
continued
throughout
the
remainder
of
his
discourse
he
called
landrin
flandrin
and
the
gaiety
became
delirious
i
was
among
those
whom
this
gaiety
made
heavy
at
heart
for
i
seemed
to
hear
the
sobs
of
the
people
above
these
bursts
of
hilarity
during
this
uproar

was
being
covered

amid
a
deep
silence
that
was
broken
at
intervals
by
cheers
the
order
of
the

which
was
purely
and
simply
a
reiteration

still
trained

for

attracted
all
paris
to
the
jardin

this
is
what
the
jardin
d
hiver
was
like
a
poet
had
pictured
it
in
a
word
they
have
put
summer
under
a
glass
case
it
was
an
immense
iron
cage
with
two
naves
forming
a
cross
as
large
as
four
or
five
cathedrals
and
covered
with
glass
entrance
to
it
was
through
a
gallery
of
wood
decorated
with
carpets
and
tapestry
on
entering
the
eyes
were
at
first
dazzled
by
a
flood
of
light
in
the
light
all
sorts
of
magnificent
flowers
and
strange
trees
with
the
foliage
and
altitudes
of
the
tropics
could
be
seen
banana
trees
palm
trees
cedars
great
leaves
enormous
thorns
and
queer
branches
twisted
and
mingled
as
in
a
virgin
forest
the
forest
alone
was
virgin
there
however
the
prettiest
women
and
the
most
beautiful
girls
of
paris
whirled
in
this
illumination
like
a
swarm
of
bees
in
a
ray
of
sunshine
above
this
gaily
dressed
throng
was
an
immense
resplendent
chandelier
of
brass
or
rather
a
great
tree
of
gold
and
flame
turned
upside
down
which
seemed
to
have
its
roots
in
the
glass
roof
and
whose
sparkling
leaves
hung
over
the
crowd
a
vast
ring
of
candelabra
and
girandoles
shone
round
the
chandelier
like
the
constellations
round
the
sun
a
resounding
orchestra
perched
high
in
a
gallery
made
the
glass
panes
rattle
harmoniously
but
what
made
the
jardin
d
hiver
unique
was
that
beyond
this
vestibule
of
light
and
music
and
noise
through
which
one
gazed
as
through
a
vague
and
dazzling
veil
a
sort
of
immense
and
tenebrous
arch
a
grotto
of
shadow
and
mystery
could
be
discerned
this
grotto
in
which
were
big
trees
a
copse
threaded
with
paths
and
clearings
and
a
fountain
that
showered
its
in
sparkling
spray
was
simply
the
end
of
the
garden
red
dots
that
resembled
oranges
of
fire
shone
here
and
there
amid
the
foliage
it
was
all
like
a
dream
the
lanterns
in
the
copse
when
one
approached
them
became
great
luminous
tulips
mingled
with
real
camellias
and
roses
one
seated
one
s
self
on
a
garden
seat
with
one
s
feet
in
the
grass
and
moss
and
one
felt
the
warmth
arising
from
a
beneath
this
grass
and
this
moss
one
happened
upon
an
immense
fireplace
in
which
half
the
trunk
of
a
tree
was
burning
in
proximity
to
a
clump
of
bushes
shivering
in
the
rain
of
a
fountain
there
were
lamps
amid
the
flowers
and
carpets
in
the
alleys
among
the
trees
were
satyrs
nude
nymphs
hydras
all
kinds
of
groups
and
statues
which
like
the
place
itself
had
something
impossible
and
living
about
them
what
were
people
doing
at
this
ball
they
danced
a
little
made
love
a
little
and
above
all
talked
politics
there
were
about
fifty
representatives
present
that
evening
the
negro
representative
louisy
mathieu
in
white
gloves
was
accompanied
by
the
negrophile

black
gloves

leaning
against

the
approaching
appearance
of
a

the
brea
affair
which
was
being
tried
at
that
very
moment
was
discussed
what
particularly
struck
these
grave
men
in
this
sinister
affair
was
that
among
the
witnesses
was
an
ironmonger
named
lenclume

a

named

a
continual
reminder
to
the

of
their
approaching
death
a
few
days
ago
an
anonymous
letter
reached
them
this
letter
advised
them
to
stamp
upon
the
flagstone
in
the
centre
of
the
casemate
which
it
was
affirmed
covered
the
orifice
of
a
well
communicating
with
old
subterranean
passages
of
the
abbey
of
vanves
that
extended
to
châtillon
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
raise
the
flagstone
and
they
could
escape
that
very
night
they
did
as
the
letter
directed
the
stone
it
was
found
did
emit
a
hollow
sound
as
though
it
covered
an
opening
but
either
because
the
police
had
been
informed
of
the
letter
or
for
some
other
reason
a
stricter
watch
than
ever
has
been
kept
upon
them
from
that
moment
and
they
have
been
unable

the
execution
of
the
condemned
men
in
the

affair
was
a
blunder
it
was
the
reappearance
of
the
scaffold
the
people
had
kicked
over
the
guillotine
the
bourgeoisie
raised
it
again
a
fatal
mistake
president
louis
bonaparte
was
inclined
to
be
merciful
the
revision
and
cassation
could
easily
have
been
delayed
the
archbishop
of

sibour
successor
of
a

had
begged
for
their
lives
but
the
stereotyped

prevailed
the
country

must
be

society
at
that
time
was

reduced

upon

he
was
an
emotional
and
eloquent
young
man
he
pleaded
for
these
men
for
the
wives
who
were
not
yet
widows
for
the
children
who
were
not
yet
orphans
and
while
speaking
he
wept
louis

listened
to
him
in
silence
then
took
his
hands
but
merely
remarked
i
am
most
unhappy
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
it
was
on
the
thursday
the
council
of
ministers
met
the
discussion
was
long
and
animated
only
one
minister
opposed
recourse
to
the
scaffold
he
was
supported
by
louis
napoleon
the
discussion
lasted
until
o
clock
but
the
majority
prevailed
and
before
the
cabinet
separated
odilon
barrot
the
minister
of
justice
signed
the
order
for
the
execution
of
three
of

the
sentences
of

the
execution
was
fixed
for
the
next
morning
friday
the
chancellor
s
office
immediately
transmitted
the
order
to
the
prefect
of
police
who
had
to
act
in
concert
with
the
military
authorities
the
sentence
having
been
imposed
by
a
the
prefect
sent
for
the
executioner
but
the
executioner
could
not
be
found
he
had
vacated
his
house
in
the
rue
des
marais
saint
martin
in
february
under
the
impression
that
like
the
guillotine
he
had
been
deposed
and
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
considerable
time
was
lost
in
tracing
him
to
his
new
residence
and
when
they
got
there
he
was
out
the
executioner
was
at
the
opera
he
had
gone
to
see
the
devil
s
it
was
near
midnight
and
in
the
absence
of
the
executioner
the
execution
had
to
be
postponed
for
one
day
during
the
interval
representative
larabit
whom
chopart
had
befriended
at
the
barricade
of
the
barriers
was
notified
and
was
able
to
see
the
president
the
president
signed
chopart
s
pardon
the
day
after
the
execution
the
prefect
of
police
summoned
the
executioner
and
reproved
him
for
his
absence
well
said
samson
i
was
passing
along
the
street
when
i
saw
a
big
yellow
poster
announcing
the
devil
s
violin
hello
said
i
to
myself
that
must
be
a
queer
piece
and
i
went
to
see
thus
a
playbill
saved
a
man
s
head
there
were
some
horrible
details
on
friday
night
while
those
who
formerly
were
called
maitres
des
basses
were
erecting
the
scaffold
at
the
barrière
de
fontainebleau
the

repaired
to
the
fort

the
executioner
in

is
officially
styled
executeur
des
daix
and
lahr
who
were
to
die
were
sleeping
they
were
in
casemate
no
with
nourry
and
chopart
there
was
a
delay
it
was
found
that
there
were
no
ropes
with
which
to
bind
the
condemned
men
the
latter
were
allowed
to
sleep
on
at
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
executioner
s
assistants
arrived
with
everything
that
was
necessary
then
the
casemate
was
entered
the
four
men
awoke
to
nourry
and
chopart
the
officials
said
get
out
of
here
they
understood
and
joyful
and
fled
into
the
adjoining
casement
daix
and
lahr
however
did
not
understand
they
sat
up
and
gazed
about
them
with
wild
frightened
eyes
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
fell
upon
them
and
bound
them
no
one
spoke
a
word
the
condemned
men
began
to
realise
what
it
all
meant
and
uttered
terrible
cries
if
we
had
not
bound
them
said
the
executioner
they
would
have
devoured
us
then
lahr
collapsed
and
began
to
pray
while
the
decree
for
their
execution
was
read
to
them
daix
continued
to
struggle
sobbing
and
roaring
with
horror
these
men
who
had
killed
so
freely
were
afraid
to
die
daix
shouted
help
help
appealed
to
the
soldiers
adjured
them
cursed
them
pleaded
to
them
in
the
name
of
general
bréa
shut
up
growled
a
sergeant
you
are
a
coward
the
execution
was
performed
with
much
ceremony
let
this
fact
be
noted
the
first
time
the
guillotine
dared
to
show
itself
after
february
an
army
was
furnished
to
guard
it
thousand
men
infantry
and
cavalry
surrounded
the
scaffold
two
generals
were
in
command
seven
guns
commanded
the
streets
which
converged
to
the
circus
of
the
barrière
de

daix
was
executed
first
when
his
head
had
fallen
and
his
body
was
unstrapped
the
trunk
from
which
a
stream
of
blood
was
pouring
fell
upon
the
scaffold
between
the
and
the
basket
the
executioners
were
nervous
and
excited
a
man
of
the
people
remarked
everybody
is
losing
his
head
on
that
guillotine
including
the
executioner
in
the
faubourgs
which
the
last
elections
to
the
national
assembly
had
so
excited
the
names
of
popular
candidates
could
still
be
seen
chalked
upon
the
walls
louis
bonaparte
was
one
of
the
candidates
his
name
appeared
on
these
bulletins
as
they
may
be
termed
in
company
with
the
names
of
raspail
and
barbès
the
day
after
the
execution
louis
napoleon
s
name
wherever
it
was
to
be
seen
had
a
red
smear
across
it
a
silent
protest
a
reproach
and
a
menace

of
the

pending
the

suicide
of
antonin
moyne
april
antonin
moyne
prior
to
february
was
a
maker
of
little
figures
and
statuettes
for
the
trade
little
figures
and
statuettes
that
is
what
we
had
come
to
trade
had
supplanted
the
state
how
empty
is
history
how
poor
is
art
inasmuch
as
there
are
no
more
big
figures
there
are
no
more
statues
antonin
moyne
made
rather
a
poor
living
out
of
his
work
he
had
however
been
able
to
give
his
son
paul
a
good
education
and
had
got
him
into
the
ecole
polytechnique
towards
the
business
being
already
bad
he
had
added
to
his
little
figures
portraits
in
pastel
with
a
statuette
here
and
a
portrait
there
he
managed
to
get
along
after
february
the
business
came
to
a
complete
standstill
the
manufacturer
who
wanted
a
model
for
a
candlestick
or
a
clock
and
the
bourgeois
who
wanted
a
portrait
failed
him
what
was
to
be
done
antonin
moyne
struggled
on
as
best
he
could
used
his
old
clothes
lived
upon
beans
and
potatoes
sold
his
to
dealers
pawned
first
his
watch
then
his
silverware
he
lived
in
a
little
apartment
in
the
rue
de
boursault
at
no
i
think
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
labruyère
the
little
apartment
gradually
became
bare
after
june
antonin
moyne
solicited
an
order
of
the
government
the
matter
dragged
along
for
six
months
three
or
four
cabinets
succeeded
each
other
and
louis
bonaparte
had
time
to
be
nominated
president
at
length
leon
faucher
gave
antonin
moyne
an
order
for
a
bust
upon
which
the
statuary
would
be
able
to
make
francs
but
he
was
informed
that
the
state
funds
being
low
the
bust
would
not
be
paid
for
until
it
was
finished
distress
came
and
hope
went
antonin
moyne
said
one
day
to
his
wife
who
was
still
young
having
been
married
to
him
when
she
was
only
fifteen
years
old
i
will
kill
the
next
day
his
wife
found
a
loaded
pistol
under
a
piece
of
furniture
she
took
it
and
hid
it
it
appears
that
antonin
moyne
found
it
again
his
reason
no
doubt
began
to
give
way
he
always
carried
a
bludgeon
and
razor
about
with
him
one
day
he
said
to
his
wife
it
is
easy
to
kill
one
s
self
with
blows
of
a
on
one
occasion
he
rose
and
opened
the
window
with
such
violence
that
his
wife
rushed
forward
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
demanded
just
get
a
breath
of
air
and
you
what
do
you
want
i
am
only
embracing
you
she
answered
on
march
a
sunday
i
think
it
was
his
wife
said
to
him
i
am
going
to
church
will
you
come
with
me
he
was
religious
and
his
wife
with
loving
watchfulness
remained
with
him
as
much
as
possible
he
replied
presently
and
went
into
the
next
room
which
was
his
son
s
bedroom
a
few
minutes
elapsed
suddenly
mme
antonin
moyne
heard
a
noise
similar
to
that
made
by
the
slamming
of
a
front
door
but
she
knew
what
it
was
she
started
and
cried
it
is
that
dreadful
pistol
she
rushed
into
the
room
her
husband
had
entered
then
recoiled
in
horror
she
had
seen
a
body
stretched
upon
the
floor
she
ran
wildly
about
the
house
screaming
for
help
but
no
one
came
either
because
everybody
was
out
or
because
owing
to
the
noise
in
the
street
she
was
not
heard
then
she
returned
the
room
and
knelt
beside
her
husband
the
shot
had
blown
nearly
all
his
head
away
the
blood
streamed
upon
the
floor
and
the
walls
and
furniture
were
spattered
with
brains
thus
marked
by
fatality
like
jean
goujon
his
master
died
antonin
moyne
a
name
which
henceforward
will
bring
to
mind
two
things
a
horrible
death
and
a
charming
talent
iv
a
visit
to
the
old
chamber
of
peers
june
the
working
men
who
sat
in
the
luxembourg
during
the
months
of
march
and
april
under
the
presidency
of
louis
blanc
showed
a
sort
of
respect
for
the
chamber
of
peers
they
replaced
the
armchairs
of
the
peers
were
occupied
but
not
soiled
there
was
no
insult
no
affront
no
abuse
not
a
piece
of
velvet
was
torn
not
a
piece
of
leather
was
dirtied
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
child
about
the
people
it
is
given
to
chalking
its
anger
its
joy
and
its
irony
on
walls
these
labouring
men
were
serious
and
inoffensive
in
the
drawers
of
the
desks
they
found
the
pens
and
knives
of
the
peers
yet
made
neither
a
cut
nor
a
spot
of
ink
a
keeper
of
the
palace
remarked
to
me
they
have
behaved
themselves
very
they
left
their
places
as
they
had
found
them
one
only
left
his
mark
and
he
had
written
in
the
drawer
of
louis
blanc
on
the
ministerial
bench
royalty
is
abolished
hurrah
for
louis
blanc
this
inscription
is
still
there
the
fauteuils
of
the
peers
were
covered
with
green
velvet
embellished
with
gold
stripes
their
desks
were
of
mahogany
covered
with
morocco
leather
and
with
drawers
of
oak
containing
writing
material
in
plenty
but
having
no
key
at
the
top
of
his
desk
each
peer
s
name
was
stamped
in
gilt
letters
on
a
piece
of
green
leather
let
into
the
wood
on
the
princes
bench
which
was
on
the
right
behind
the
ministerial
bench
there
was
no
name
but
a
gilt
plate
bearing
the
words
the
princes
this
plate
and
the
names
of
the
peers
had
been
torn
off
not
by
the
working
men
but
by
order
of
the
provisional
government
a
few
changes
were
made
in
the
rooms
which
served
as
to
the
assembly
puget
s
admirable
milo
of
crotona
which
ornamented
the
vestibule
at
the
top
of
the
grand
staircase
was
taken
to
the
old
museum
and
a
marble
of
some
kind
was
substituted
for
it
the
full
length
statue
of
the
duke
d
orleans
which
was
in
the
second
vestibule
was
taken
i
know
not
where
and
replaced
by
a
statue
of
pompey
with
gilt
face
arms
and
legs
the
statue
at
the
foot
of
which
according
to
tradition
assassinated
caesar
fell
the
picture
of
founders
of
constitutions
in
the
third
vestibule
a
picture
in
which
napoleon
louis
xviii
and
louis
philippe
figured
was
removed
by
order
of
and
replaced
by
a
magnificent
gobelin
tapestry
borrowed
from
the
hard
by
this
third
vestibule
is
the
old
hall
of
the
chamber
of
peers
which
was
built
in
for
the
senate
this
hall
which
is
small
narrow
and
obscure
supported
by
meagre
corinthian
columns
with
bases
and
white
capitals
furnished
with
flat
desks
and
chairs
in
the
empire
style
with
green
velvet
seats
the
whole
in
mahogany
and
paved
with
white
marble
relieved
by
lozenges
of
red
saint
anne
marble
this
hall
so
full
of
memories
had
been
religiously
preserved
and
after
the
new
hall
was
built
in
had
been
used
for
the
private
conferences
of
the
court
of
peers
it
was
in
this
old
hall
of
the
senate
that
marshal

ascends
the
tribune
step
by
step
and
slowly
he
is
solemn
before
being
eloquent
then
he
places
his
right
hand
on
the
table
of
the
tribune
throwing
his
left
hand
behind
his
back
and
thus
shows
himself
sideways
to
the
assembly
in
the
attitude
of
an
athlete
he
is
always
in
black
well
brushed
and
well
buttoned
up
his
delivery
which
is
slow
at
first
gradually
becomes
animated
as
do
his
thoughts
but
in
becoming
animated
his
speech
becomes
hoarse
and
his
thoughts
cloudy
hence
a
certain
hesitation
among
his
hearers
some
being
unable
to
catch
what
he
says
the
others
not
understanding
all
at

from
the

darts
a
flash

one
is
dazzled
the

that

monsieur
thiers
thiers
wants
to
treat
men
ideas
and
revolutionary
events
with
parliamentary
routine
he
plays
his
old
game
of
constitutional
tricks
in
face
of
abysms
and
the
dreadful
upheavals
of
the
chimerical
and
unexpected
he
does
not
realise
that
everything
has
been
transformed
he
finds
a
resemblance
between
our
own
times
and
the
time
when
he
governed
and
starts
out
from
this
this
resemblance
exists
in
point
of
fact
but
there
is
in
it
a
something
that
is
colossal
and
monstrous
thiers
has
no
suspicion
of
this
and
pursues
the
even
tenour
of
his
way
all
his
life
he
has
been
stroking
cats
and
coaxing
them
with
all
sorts
of
cajolling
processes
and
feline
ways
he
is
trying
to
play
the
same
game
and
does
not
see
that
the
animals
have
grown
beyond
all
measure
and
that
it
is
wild
beasts
that
he
is
keeping
about
him
a
strange
sight
it
is
to
see
this
little
man
trying
to
stroke
the
roaring
muzzle
of
a
revolution
with
his
little
hand
when
thiers
is
interrupted
he
gets
excited
folds
and
unfolds
his
arms
then
raises
his
hands
to
his
mouth
his
nose
his
spectacles
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
ends
by
clasping
the
back
of
his
head
convulsively
with
both
hands
i
have
always
entertained
towards
this

dufaure
arrived
in
the
chamber
with
a
provincial
and
accent
that
was
very
queer
but
he
possessed
a
mind
so
clear
that
occasionally
it
was
almost
luminous
and
so
accurate
that
occasionally
it
was
decisive
with
that
his
speech
was
deliberate
and
cold
but
sure
solid
and
calmly
pushed
difficulties
before
it

he
is

grave
and
honest
man
who
has
held
power
without
greatness
but
with
probity
and
who
speaks
from
the
tribune
without
brilliancy
but
with
authority
his
person
resembles
his
talent
in
appearance
he
is
dignified
simple
and
sober

up

on
every
a
and
like
charles

pronounces
he
speaks
badly
and
writes
well
in

his
gesture
consists
of
little
feverish
pats
upon
his
manuscript
with
the
palm
of
his

sometimes
he
becomes
irritated
and
froths
but
it
is
cold

worn
the

clothes
his
prison
clothes
rags
which
he
displayed
with
sombre
pride
at
his
club
he
renewed
only
his
boots
and
his

were
always
black
at

during
his
eight
months
of

for
the

small

an

crushed
and
trampled

great

no
hypocrisy
the

in
private
as
in

harsh

nothing
of

everything
of

populace
with
this
a
man
of
letters
almost
erudite
at
certain
moments
he
was
no
longer
a
man
but
a
sort
of
lugubrious
apparition
in
which
all
degrees
of
hatred
born
of
all
degrees
of
misery
seemed
to
be
incarnated

during

lamartine
came
and
sat
beside

in
the
place
usually
occupied
by

interjected
in

undertone
sarcastic
remarks
about

he
is

he
is
voluble

followed
by
emmanuel

the
assembly
was
stormy
this
man
commented
lamartine
has
arms
too
small
for
the
affairs
he
undertakes
he
is
given
to
joining
in
mêlées
and
does
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
them
again
the
tempest
tempts
him

i
do
not
know
how
they
can
see
a
serpent
in
this
man
said
lamartine
he
is
a
provincial
laughing
the
while
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
from
my
drawer
asked
me
for
a
pen
asked
for
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
wrote
a
few
lines
this
done
he
mounted
the
tribune
and
addressed
grave
and
haughty
words
to
thiers
who
had
been
attacking
the
revolution
of
february
then
he
returned
to
our
bench
shook
hands
with
me
while
the
left
applauded
and
the
right
waxed
indignant
and
calmly
emptied
the
snuff
in
s
snuffbox
into
his
own
boulay

meurthe
boulay
de
la
meurthe
was
a
stout
kindly
man
bald
short
enormous
with
a
short
nose
and
a
not
very
long
wit
he
was
a
friend
of
hard
whom
he
called
and
of
jerome
bonaparte
whom
he
addressed
as
your
the
assembly
on
january
made
him
of
the
republic
it
was
somewhat
sudden
and
unexpected
by
everybody
except
himself
this
latter
fact
was
evident
from
the
long
speech
learned
by
heart
that
he
delivered
after
being
sworn
in
at
its
conclusion
the
assembly
applauded
then
a
roar
of
laughter
succeeded
the
applause
everybody
laughed
including
himself
the
assembly
out
of
irony
he
in
good
faith
odilon
barrot
who
since
the
previous
evening
had
been
keenly
regretting
that
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
made
contemplated
the
scene
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
bitter
smile
the
assembly
followed
boulay
de
la
meurthe
congratulated
and
gratified
with
its
eyes
and
in
every
look
could
be
read
this
well
i
never
he
takes
himself
seriously
when
he
was
taking
the
oath
in
a
voice
of
thunder
which
made
everybody
smile
boulay
de
la
meurthe
looked
as
if
he
were
dazzled
by
the
republic
and
the
assembly
did
not
look
as

were
dazzled

dupin
dupin
has
a
style
of
wit
that
is
peculiar
to
himself
it
is
gaulish
tinged
with
the
wit
of
a
limb
of
the
law
and
with
jovial
grossness
when
the
vote
upon
the
bill
against
universal
suffrage
was
about
to
be
taken
some
member
of
the
majority
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
went
to
him
and
said
you
are
our
president
and
moreover
a
great
legist
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
enlighten
me
i
am
undecided
is
it
true
that
the
bill
violates
the
constitution
dupin
appeared
to
think
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
no
it
doesn
t
violate
it
but
it
lifts
its
clothes
up
as
high
as
possible
this
reminds
me
of
what
he
said
to
me
the
day
i
spoke
upon
the
education
bill
baudin
had
permitted
me
to
take
his
turn
to
speak
and
i
went
up
to
the
presidential
chair
to
notify
dupin
ah
you
are
going
to
speak
so
much
the
better
said
he
and
pointing
to
barthélemy
saint
hilaire
who
was
then
occupying
the
tribune
and
delivering
a
long
and
minute
technical
speech
against
the

added
he
is
rendering
you
a
service
he
is
doing
the
preparatory
work
he
is
turning
the

s
trousers
down
this
done
you
will
be
able
to
at

completed
the
phrase
with
the
expressive
gesture
which
consists
of
tapping
the
back
of
the
fingers
of
the
left

and
laughed
little

his
elevation
to
the
presidency
december
the
proclamation
of
louis
bonaparte
as
president
of
the
republic
was
made
on
december
the
weather
which
up
to
then
had
been
admirable
and
reminded
one
more
of
the
approach
of
spring
than
of
the
beginning
of
winter
suddenly
changed
december
was
the
first
cold
day
of
the
year
popular
superstition
had
it
that
the
sun
of
austerlitz
was
becoming
clouded
this
proclamation
was
made
in
a
somewhat
unexpected
manner
it
had
been
announced
for
friday
it
was
made
suddenly
on
wednesday
towards
o
clock
the
approaches
to
the
assembly
were
occupied
by
troops
a
regiment
of
infantry
was
massed
in
rear
of
the
palais
d
orsay
a
regiment
of
dragoons
was
echeloned
along
the
quay
the
troopers
shivered
and
looked
moody
the
population
assembled
in
great
uneasiness
not
knowing
what
it
all
meant
for
some
days
a
bonapartist
movement
had
been
vaguely
spoken
of
the
faubourgs
it
was
said
were
to
turn
out
and
march
to
the
assembly
shouting
long
live
the
emperor
the
day
before
the
funds
had
dropped
francs
napoleon
bonaparte
greatly
alarmed
came
to
see
me
the
assembly
resembled
a
public
square
it
was
a
number
of
groups
rather
than
a
parliament
in
the
tribune
a
very
useful
bill
for
regulating
the
publicity
of
the
sessions
and
substituting
the
state
printing
office
the
former
royal
printing
office
for
the
printing
office
of
the
moniteur
was
being
discussed
but
no
one
listened
bureau
de
puzy
the
questor
was
speaking
suddenly
there
was
a
stir
in
the
assembly
which
was
being
invaded
by
a
crowd
of
deputies
who
entered
by
the
door
on
the
left
it
was
the
committee
appointed
to
count
the
votes
and
was
returning
to
announce
the
result
of
the
election
to
the
presidency
it
was
o
clock
the
chandeliers
were
lighted
there
was
an
immense
crowd
in
the
public
galleries
all
the
ministers
were
present
cavaignac
calm
attired
in
a
black
and
not
wearing
any
decoration
was
in
his
place
he
kept
his
right
hand
thrust
in
the
breast
of
his
buttoned
and
made
no
reply
to
bastide
who
now
and
then
whispered
in
his
ear
fayet
bishop
of
orleans
occupied
a
chair
in
front
of
the
general
which
prompted
the
bishop
of
langres
the
abbé
parisis
to
remark
that
is
the
place
of
a
dog
not
a
lamartine
was
absent
the
of
the
committee
read
a
cold
discourse
that
was
coldly
listened
to
when
he
reached
the
enumeration
of
the
votes
cast
and
came
to
lamartine
s
total
votes
the
right
burst
into
a
laugh
a
mean
vengeance
sarcasm
of
the
unpopular
men
of
yesterday
for
the
unpopular
man
of
cavaignac
took
leave
in
a
few
brief
and
dignified
words
which
were
applauded
by
the
whole
assembly
he
announced
that
the
ministry
had
resigned
in
a
body
and
that
he
cavaignac
laid
down
the
power
he
thanked
the
assembly
with
emotion
a
few
representatives
wept
then
president
marrast
proclaimed
the
citizen
louis
bonaparte
president
of
the
republic
a
few
representatives
about
the
bench
where
louis
bonaparte
sat
applauded
the
remainder
of
the
assembly
preserved
a
glacial
silence
they
were
leaving
the
lover
for
the
husband
armand
marrast
called
upon
the
elect
of
the
nation
to
take
the
oath
of
office
there
was
a
stir
louis

buttoned
up
in
a
black
the
decoration
of
representative
of
the
people
and
the
star
of
the
legion
of
honour
on
his
breast
entered
by
the
door
on
the
right
ascended
the
tribune
repeated
in
a
calm
voice
the
words
of
the
oath
that
president
marrast
dictated
to
him
called
upon
god
and
men
to
bear
witness
then
read
with
a
foreign
accent
which
was
displeasing
a
speech
that
was
interrupted
at
rare
intervals
by
murmurs
of
approval
he
eulogized
cavaignac
and
the
eulogy
was
noted
and
applauded
after
a
few
minutes
he
descended
from
the
tribune
not
like
cavaignac
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
chamber
but
amid
an
immense
shout
of
long
live
the
republic
somebody
shouted
hurrah
for
the
constitution
before
leaving
louis
bonaparte
went
over
to
his
former
tutor
vieillard
who
was
seated
in
the
eighth
section
on
the
left
and
shook
hands
with
him
then
the
president
of
the
assembly
invited
the
committee
to
accompany
the
president
of
the
republic
to
his
palace
and
have
rendered
to
him
the
honours
due
to
his
rank
the
word
caused
the
mountain
to
murmur
i
shouted
from
my
bench
to
his
functions
the
president
of
the
assembly
announced
that
the
president
of
the
republic
had
charged
odilon
barrot
with
the
formation
of
a
cabinet
and
that
the
names
of
the
new
ministers
would
be
announced
to
the
assembly
in
a
message
that
in
fact
a
supplement
to
the
moniteur
would
be
distributed
to
the
representatives
that
very
evening
it
was
remarked
for
everything
was
remarked
on
that
day
which
began
a
decisive
phase
in
the
history
of
the
country
that
president
marrast
called
louis
bonaparte
citizen
and
odilon
barrot
meanwhile
the
ushers
their
chief
deponceau
at
their
head
the
officers
of
the
chamber
the
questors
and
among
them
general
lebreton
in
full
uniform
had
grouped
themselves
below
the
tribune
several
representatives
had
joined
them
there
was
a
stir
indicating
that
louis
bonaparte
was
about
to
leave
the
enclosure
a
few
deputies
rose
there
were
shouts
of
sit
down
sit
down
louis
bonaparte
went
out
the
malcontents
to
manifest
their
indifference
wanted
to
continue
the
debate
on
the
printing
office
bill
but
the
assembly
was
too
agitated
even
to
remain
seated
it
rose
in
a
tumult
and
the
chamber
was
soon
empty
it
was
half
past
the
proceedings
had
lasted
half
an
hour
as
i
left
the
assembly
alone
and
avoided
as
a
man
who
had
disdained
the
opportunity
to
be
a
minister
i
passed
in
the
outer
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
group
in
which
i
noticed
montalembert
and
also
changarnier
in
the
uniform
of
a
of
the
national
guard
changarnier
had
just
been
escorting
louis
bonaparte
to
the
elysee
i
heard
him
say
all
passed
off
when
i
found
myself
in
the
place
de
la
revolution
there
were
no
longer
either
troops
or
crowd
all
had
disappeared
a
few
came
from
the
the
night
was
dark
and
cold
a
bitter
wind
blew
from
the
river
and
at
the
same
time
a
heavy
breaking
in
the
west
covered
the
horizon
with
silent
flashes
of
lightning
a
december
wind
with
august
lightning
such
were
the
omens
of
that
day
iii
the
first
official
dinner
december
louis
bonaparte
gave
his
first
dinner
last
evening
saturday
the
two
days
after
his
elevation
to
the
presidency
of
the
republic
the
chamber
had
adjourned
for
the
christmas
holidays
i
was
at
home
in
my
new
lodging
in
the
rue
de
la
tour
d
auvergne
occupied
with
i
know
not
what
bagatelles
in
when
a
letter
addressed
to
me
and
brought
by
a
dragoon
was
handed
to
me
i
opened
the
envelope
and
this
is
what
i
read
the
orderly
officer
on
duty
has
the
honour
to
inform
monsieur
the
general
changarnier
that
he
is
invited
to
dinner
at
the
on
saturday
at
o
clock
i
wrote
below
it
delivered
by
mistake
to
victor
hugo
and
sent
the
letter
back
by
the
dragoon
who
had
brought
it
an
hour
later
came
another
letter
from
de
persigny
prince
louis
s
former
companion
in
plots
his
private
secretary
this
letter
contained
profuse
apologies
for
the
error
committed
and
advised
me
that
i
was
among
those
invited
my
letter
had
been
addressed
by
mistake
to
conti
the
representative
from
corsica
at
the
head
of
de
persigny
s
letter
written
with
a
pen
were
the
words
household
of
the
i
remarked
that
the
form
of
these
invitations
was
exactly
similar
to
the
form
employed
by
king
louis
philippe
as
i
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
that
might
resemble
intentional
coldness
i
dressed
it
was
half
past
and
i
set
out
immediately
for
the
elysee
half
past
struck
as
i
arrived
there
as
i
passed
i
glanced
at
the
sinister
portal
of
the
praslin
mansion
adjoining
the
elysee
the
large
green
carriage
entrance
enframed
between
two
doric
pillars
of
the
time
of
the
empire
was
closed
gloomy
and
vaguely
outlined
by
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
one
of
the
double
doors
of
the
entrance
to
the
elysee
was
closed
two
soldiers
of
the
line
were
on
guard
the
was
scarcely
lighted
and
a
mason
in
his
working
clothes
with
a
ladder
on
his
shoulder
was
crossing
it
nearly
all
the
windows
of
the
outhouses
on
the
right
had
been
broken
and
were
mended
with
paper
i
entered
by
the
door
on
the
perron
three
servants
in
black
coats
received
me
one
opened
the
door
another
took
my
mantle
the
third
said
monsieur
on
the
first
floor
i
ascended
the
grand
staircase
there
were
a
carpet
and
flowers
on
it
but
that
chilly
and
unsettled
air
about
it
peculiar
to
places
into
which
one
is
moving
on
the
first
floor
an
usher
asked
monsieur
has
come
to
dinner
yes
i
said
are
they
at
table
yes
in
that
case
i
am
but
monsieur
exclaimed
the
usher
nearly
everybody
arrived
after
the
dinner
had
begun
go
in
monsieur
is
i
remarked
this
military
and
imperial
punctuality
which
used
to
be
customary
with
napoleon
with
the
emperor
o
clock
meant
o
clock
i
crossed
the
then
a
salon
and
entered
the
it
was
a
square
room
wainscotted
in
the
empire
style
with
white
wood

poor

around
the
room
was
a
sideboard
in
the
middle
was
a
long
table
with
rounded
ends
at
which
about
fifteen
guests
were
seated
one
end
of
the
table
that
furthest
from
the
entrance
was
raised
and
here
the
president
of
the
republic
was
seated
between
two
women
the
marquise
de
née

de
chimay
tallien

on
his
right
and
mme

hand
prince
de
la
moskowa
who
was
next
to
general
changarnier
made
room
for
me
beside
him
and
i
seated
myself
at
the
table
i
ate
quickly
for
the
president
had
interrupted
the
dinner
to
enable
me
to
catch
up
with
the
company
the
second
course
had
been
reached
opposite
to
me
was
general
rulhières
an
the
representative

and
lucien

the
other
guests
were
unknown
to
me
among
them
was
a
young
major
of
cavalry
decorated
with
the
legion
of
honour
this
major
alone
was
in
uniform
the
others
wore
evening
dress
the
prince
had
a
rosette
of
the
legion
of
honour
in
his
buttonhole
everybody
conversed
with
his
neighbour
louis
bonaparte
appeared
to
prefer
his
neighbour
on
the
right
to
his
neighbour
on
the
left
the
marquise
de
hallays
is
years
old
and
looks

fine
eyes
not
much
hair
an
ugly
mouth
white
skin
a
shapely
neck
charming
arms
the
prettiest
little
hands
in
the
world
admirable
shoulders
at
present
she
is
separated
from
de
hallays
she
has
had
eight
children
the
first
seven
by
her
husband
she
was
married
fifteen
years
ago
during
the
early
period
of
their
marriage
she
used
to
fetch
her
husband
from
the
even
in
the
daytime
and
take
him
off
to
bed
sometimes
a
servant
would
enter
and
say
madame
the
marquise
is
asking
for
monsieur
the
the
marquis
would
obey
the
summons
this
made
the
company
who
happened
to
be
present
laugh
the
marquis
and
marquise
have
fallen
out
she
was
the
mistress
of
napoleon
son
of
jerome
you
know
said
prince
de
la
moskowa
to
me
sotto
voce
now
she
is
louis
s
well
i
answered
changing
a
napoleon
for
a
louis
is
an
everyday
these
bad
puns
did
not
prevent
me
from
eating
and
observing
the
two
women
seated
beside
the
president
had
chairs
the
president
s
chair
was
surmounted
with
a
little
round
top
as
i
was
about
to
draw
some
inference
from
this
i
looked
at
the
other
chairs
and
saw
that
four
or
five
guests
myself
among
them
had
chairs
similar
to
that
of
the
president
the
chairs
were
covered
with
red
velvet
with
gilt
headed
nails
a
more
serious
thing
i
noticed
was
that
everybody
addressed
the
president
of
the
republic
as
monseigneur
and
your
i
who
had
called
him
prince
had
the
air
of
a
demagogue
when
we
rose
from
table
the
prince
asked
after
my
wife
and
then
apologized
profusely
for
the
rusticity
of
the
service
i
am
not
yet
installed
he
said
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
arrived
here
there
was
hardly
a
mattress
for
me
to
sleep
the
dinner
was
a
very
ordinary
one
and
the
prince
did
well
to
excuse
himself
the
service
was
of
common
white
china
and
the
silverware
bourgeois
worn
and
gross
in
the
middle
of
the
table
was
a
rather
fine
vase
of
craquelé
ornamented
with
ormolu
in
the
bad
taste
of
the
time
of
louis
xvi
however
we
heard
music
in
an
adjoining
hall
it
is
a
surprise
said
the
president
to
us
they
are
the
musicians
from
the
a
minute
afterwards
programmes
written
with
a
pen
were
handed
round
they
indicated
that
the
following
five
selections
were
being
played
priere
de
la
fantaisie
sur
des
airs
favoris
de
la
reine
final
de
robert
bruce
marche
la
victoire
pas
redoublé
in
the
rather
uneasy
state
of
mind
i
like
the
whole
of
france
was
in
at
that
moment
i
could
not
help
remarking
this
victory
piece
coming
after
the
republican
i
rose
from
table
still
hungry
we
went
into
the
grand
salon
which
was
separated
from
the
by
the
smaller
salon
that
i
had
passed
through
on
entering
this
grand
salon
was
extremely
ugly
it
was
white
with
figures
on
panels
after
the
fashion
of
those
of
pompeii
the
whole
of
the
furniture
being
in
the
empire
style
with
the
exception
of
the
armchairs
which
were
in
tapestry
and
gold
and
in
fairly
good
taste
there
were
three
arched
windows
to
which
three
large
mirrors
of
the
same
shape
at
the
other
end
of
the
salon
formed
pendants
and
one
of
which
the
middle
one
was
a
door
the
window
curtains
were
of
fine
white
satin
richly
flowered
while
the
prince
de
la
moskowa
and
i
were
talking
socialism
the
mountain
communism
louis
bonaparte
came
up
and
took
me
aside
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
situation
i
was
reserved
i
told
him
that
a
good
beginning
had
been
made
that
the
task
was
a
difficult
but
a
grand
one
that
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
reassure
the
bourgeoisie
and
satisfy
the
people
to
give
tranquillity
to
the
former
work
to
the
latter
and
life
to
all
that
after
the
little
governments
those
of
the
elder
bourbons
louis
philippe
and
the
republic
of
february
a
great
one
was
required
that
the
emperor
had
made
a
great
government
through
war
and
that
he
himself
ought
to
make
a
great
one
through
peace
that
the
french
people
having
been
illustrious
for
three
centuries
did
not
propose
to
become
ignoble
that
it
was
his
failure
to
appreciate
this
of
the
people
and
the
national
pride
that
was
the
chief
cause
of
louis
philippe
s
downfall
that
in
a
word
he
must
decorate
peace
how
asked
louis
napoleon
by
all
the
greatness
of
art
literature
and
science
by
the
victories
of
industry
and
progress
popular
labour
can
accomplish
miracles
and
then
france
is
a
conquering
nation
when
she
does
not
make
conquests
with
the
sword
she
wants
to
make
them
with
the
mind
know
this
and
act
accordingly
ignore
it
and
you
will
be
he
looked
thoughtful
and
went
away
then
he
returned
thanked
me
warmly
and
we
continued
to
converse
we
spoke
about
the
press
i
advised
him
to
respect
it
profoundly
and
at
the
same
time
to
establish
a
state
press
the
state
without
a
newspaper
in
the
midst
of
newspapers
i
observed
restricting
itself
to
governing
while
publicity
and
polemics
are
the
rule
reminds
one
of
the
knights
of
the
fifteenth
century
who
obstinately
persisted
in
fighting
against
cannon
with
swords
they
were
always
beaten
i
grant
that
it
was
noble
you
will
grant
that
it
was
he
spoke
of
the
emperor
it
is
here
he
said
that
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
i
could
not
this
palace
without
emotion
the
emperor
had
me
brought
to
him
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
i
was
seven
years
old
it
was
in
the
grand
salon
then
louis
bonaparte
talked
about
la
malmaison
he
said
they
have
respected
it
i
visited
the
place
in
detail
about
six
weeks
ago
this
is
how
i
came
to
do
so
i
had
gone
to
see
odilon
barrot
at
bougival
dine
with
me
he
said
i
will
with
it
was
o
clock
what
shall
we
do
until
dinner
time
let
us
go
and
see
la
malmaison
suggested
barrot
we
went
nobody
else
was
with
us
arrived
at
la
malmaison
we
rang
the
bell
a
porter
opened
the
gate
barrot
spoke
we
want
to
see
la
impossible
replied
the
porter
what
do
you
mean
impossible
i
have
from
whom
from
her
majesty
queen
christine
to
whom
the
château
belongs
at
but
monsieur
here
is
a
stranger
who
has
come
expressly
to
visit
the
impossible
well
exclaimed
odilon
barrot
it
s
funny
that
this
door
should
be
closed
to
the
emperor
s
nephew
the
porter
started
and
threw
his
cap
on
the
ground
he
was
an
old
soldier
to
whom
the
post
had
been
granted
as
a
pension
the
emperor
s
nephew
he
cried
oh
sire
enter
he
wanted
to
kiss
my
clothes
we
visited
the
château
everything
is
still
about
in
its
place
i
recognised
nearly
everything
the
first
consul
s
study
the
chamber
of
his
mother
my
own
the
furniture
in
several
rooms
has
not
been
changed
i
found
a
little
armchair
i
had
when
i
was
a
i
said
to
the
prince
you
see
thrones
disappear
while
we
were
talking
a
few
persons
came
among
others
duclerc
the
of
finance
of
the
executive
committee
an
old
woman
in
black
velvet
whom
i
did
not
know
and
lord
normanby
the
english
ambassador
whom
the
president
quickly
took
into
an
adjoining
salon
i
saw
lord
normanby
taken
aside
in
the
same
way
by
louis
philippe
the
president
in
his
salon
had
an
air
of
timidity
and
did
not
appear
at
home
he
came
and
went
from
group
to
group
more
like
an
embarrassed
stranger
than
the
master
of
the
house
however
his
remarks
are
and
sometimes
witty
he
endeavoured
to
get
my
opinion
anent
his
ministry
but
in
vain
i
would
say
nothing
either
good
or
bad
about
it
besides
the
ministry
is
only
a
mask
or
more
properly
speaking
a
screen
that
hides
a
baboon
thiers
is
behind
it
this
is
beginning
to
bother
louis
bonaparte
he
has
to
contend
against
eight
ministers
all
of
whom
seek
to
belittle
him
each
is
pulling
his
own
way
among
these
ministers
some
are
his
avowed
enemies
nominations
promotions
and
lists
arrive
all
made
out
from
the
place
saint
georges
they
have
to
be
accepted
signed
and
endorsed
yesterday
louis
bonaparte
complained
about
it
to
the
prince
de
la
moskowa
remarking
wittily
they
want
to
make
of
me
a
prince
albert
of
the
odilon
barrot
appeared
mournful
and
discouraged
he
left
the
council
with
a
crushed
air
de
la
moskowa
encountered
him
hello
said
he
how
goes
it
pray
for
us
replied
odilon
barrot
whew
said
moskowa
this
is
tragical
what
are
we
to
do
went
on
odilon
barrot
how
are
we
to
rebuild
this
old
society
in
which
everything
is
collapsing
efforts
to
prop
it
up
only
help
to
bring
it
down
if
you
touch
it
it
topples
over
ah
pray
for
us
and
he
raised
his
eyes
skywards
i
quitted
the
elysee
about
o
clock
as
i
was
going
the
president
said
to
me
wait
a
then
he
went
into
an
adjoining
room
and
came
out
again
a
moment
later
with
some
papers
which
he
placed
in
my
hand
saying
for
madame
victor
they
were
tickets
of
admission
to
the
gallery
of
the
for
the
review
that
is
to
be
held
and
as
i
went
home
i
thought
a
good
deal
i
thought
about
this
abrupt
moving
in
this
trial
of
etiquette
this
mixture
this
surface
of
a
deep
unfathomed
quantity
that
is
called
the
president
of
the
republic
his
entourage
the
whole
circumstances
of
his
position
this
man
who
can
be
and
is
addressed
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
from
all
sides
at
once
as
prince
highness
monsieur
monseigneur
and
citizen
is
not
one
of
the
least
curious
and
characteristic
factors
of
the
situation
everything
that
is
happening
at
this
moment
stamps
its
mark
upon
this
personage
who
sticks
at
nothing
to
attain
his
ends

made
a

which
is
an

thing
for
him
to
do
and
said
monsieur
thiers
there
are
that
s
funny
retorted
thiers
it
is
precisely
the
answer
the
president
of
the
republic
gave
to
me
the
day
i
said
make
faucher
a
minister
at
this
ball
it
was
remarked
that
louis
bonaparte
sought
berryer
s
company
attached
himself
to
him
and
led
him
into
quiet
corners
the
prince
looked
as
though
he
were
following
berryer
and
berryer
as
though
he
were
trying
to
avoid
the
prince
at
o
clock
the
president
said
to
berryer
come
with
me
to
the
berryer
excused
himself
prince
said
he
it
would
give
rise
to
gossip
people
would
believe
i
am
engaged
in
a
love
affair
pish
replied
louis
bonaparte
laughingly
representatives
are
inviolable
the
prince
went
away
alone
and
the
following
quatrain
was
circulated
vain
l
empire
met
du
fard
on
baisse
ses
yeux
et
sa
robe
et
so
derobe
a
february
although
he
is
animated
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
and
has
a
very
visible
quantity
of
intelligence
and
aptitude
i
fear
that
louis
bonaparte
will
find
his
task
too
much
for
him
to
him
france
the
century
the
new
spirit
the
instincts
peculiar
to
the
soil
and
the
period
are
so
many
closed
books
he
looks
without
understanding
them
at
minds
that
are
working
paris
events
men
things
and
ideas
he
belongs
to
that
class
of
ignorant
persons
who
are
called
princes
and
to
that
category
of
foreigners
who
are
called
to
those
who
examine
him
closely
he
has
the
air
of
a
patient
rather
than
of
a
governing
man
there
is
nothing
of
the
bonapartes
about
him
either
in
his
face
or
manner
he
probably
is
not
a
bonaparte
the
free
and
easy
ways
of
queen
hortense
are
remembered
he
is
a
memento
of
holland
said
alexis
de
saint
priest
to
me
yesterday
louis
bonaparte
certainly
possesses
the
cold
manner
of
the
dutch
louis
bonaparte
knows
so
little
about
paris
that
the
first
time
i
saw
him
he
said
to
me
i
have
been
hunting
for
you
i
went
to
your
former
residence
what
is
this
place
des
vosges
it
is
the
place
royale
i
said
ah
he
continued
is
it
an
old
place
he
wanted
to
see
beranger
he
went
to
passy
twice
without
being
able
to
find
him
at
home
his
cousin
napoleon
timed
his
visit
more
happily
and
found
béranger
by
his
fireside
he
asked
him
what
do
you
advise
my
cousin
to
do
to
observe
the
and
what
ought
he
to
avoid
violating
the
béranger
could
not
be
induced
to
say
anything
else
yesterday
december
i
was
at
the
français
rachel
played
adrienne
jerome
bonaparte
occupied
a
box
next
to
mine
during
an
entr
acte
i
paid
him
a
visit
we
chatted
he
said
to
me
louis
is
mad
he
is
suspicious
of
his
friends
and
delivers
himself
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
he
is
suspicious
of
his
family
and
allows
himself
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
by
the
old
royalist
parties
on
my
return
to
france
i
was
better
received
by
louis
philippe
at
the
tuileries
than
i
am
at
the
elysee
by
my
nephew
i
said
to
him
the
other
day
before
one
of
his
ministers
fould
just
remember
a
little
when
you
were
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
monsieur
here
i
pointed
to
fould
called
upon
me
in
the
rue
d
alger
where
i
lived
and
begged
me
in
the
name
of
mm
thiers
mole
duvergier
de
hauranne
berryer
and
bugeaud
to
enter
the
lists
for
the
presidency
he
told
me
that
never
would
you
get
the
constitutionnel
that
in
mole
s
opinion
you
were
an
idiot
and
that
thiers
looked
upon
you
as
a
blockhead
that
i
alone
could
rally
everybody
to
me
and
win
against
cavaignac
i
refused
i
told
them
that
you
represented
youth
and
the
future
that
you
had
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
you
whereas
i
could
hardly
count
upon
eight
or
ten
years
that
i
was
an
invalid
and
wanted
to
be
let
alone
that
is
what
these
people
were
doing
and
that
is
what
i
did
and
you
forget
all
this
and
you
make
these
gentlemen
the
masters
and
you
show
the
door
to
your
cousin
my
son
who
defended
you
in
the
assembly
and
devoted
himself
to
furthering
your
candidacy
and
you
are
strangling
universal
suffrage
which
made
you
what
you
are
i
faith
i
shall
say
like
mole
that
you
are
an
idiot
and
like
thiers
that
you
are
a
blockhead
the
king
of
westphalia
paused
for
a
moment
then
continued
and
do
you
know
monsieur
victor
hugo

he
replied

perceived
a
balloon
at
the
end
of
a
street
leading
to
montmartre
i
went
up
to
it
a
small
crowd
bordered
a
large
square
space
that
was
walled
in
by
the
perpendicular
bluffs
of
montmartre
in
this
space
three
balloons
were
being
inflated
a
large
one
a
one
and
a
small
one
the
large
one
was
yellow
the
medium
one
white
and
the
small
one
striped
yellow
and
red
in
the
crowd
it
was
whispered
that
gambetta
was
going
sure
enough
i
saw
him
in
a
group
near
the
yellow
balloon
wearing
a
heavy
overcoat
and
a
sealskin
cap
he
seated
himself
upon
a
and
put
on
a
pair
of
high
boots
a
leather
bag
was
slung
over
his
shoulder
he
took
it
off
entered
the
balloon
and
a
young
man
the
aeronaut
tied
the
bag
to
the
cordage
above
gambetta
s
head
it
was
half
past
the
weather
was
fine
and
sunshiny
with
a
light
southerly
breeze
all
at
once
the
yellow
balloon
rose
with
three
men
in
it
one
of
whom
was
gambetta
then
the
white
balloon
went
up
with
three
men
one
of
whom
waved
a
tricolour
flag
beneath
gambetta
s
balloon
hung
a
long
tricolour
streamer
long
live
the
republic
shouted
the
crowd
the
two
balloons
went
up
for
some
distance
the
white
one
going
higher
than
the
yellow
one
then
they
began
to
descend
ballast
was
thrown
out
but
they
continued
their
downward
flight

disappeared
behind
montmartre
hill

saint
denis
plain

the

first
nearby
a
roll
of
drums
followed
by
the
blast
of
a
bugle
exquisite
melody
winged
and
warlike
then
all
is
still
in
twenty
seconds
the
drums
roll
again
then
the
bugle
rings
out
but
further
off
then
silence
once
more
an
instant
later
further
off
still
the
same
song
of
bugle
and
drum
falls
more
faintly
but
still
distinctly
upon
the
ear
then
after
a
pause
the
roll
and
blast
are
repeated
very
far
away
then
they
are
heard
again
at
the
extremity
of
the
horizon
but
indistinctly
and
like
an
echo
day
breaks
and
the
shout
to
arms
is
heard

a
repetition

was
moved
to
tears
i
took
refuge
in

not
address

the
word
in
a
carriage
while
the
enthusiastic
people
shouted
long
live
the

past
impassible

my

to
it
we

consider
the
matter

neither
dupe
nor
accomplice
you
lie
march
session
of
the
