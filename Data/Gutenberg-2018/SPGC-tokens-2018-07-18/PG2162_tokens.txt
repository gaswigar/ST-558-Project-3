propagandism
is
not
as
some
suppose
a
trade
because
nobody
will
follow
a
trade
at
which
you
may
work
with
the
industry
of
a
slave
and
die
with
the
reputation
of
a
mendicant
the
motives
of
any
persons

pursue
such
a
profession
must
be
different

among
the
men
and
women
prominent
in
the
public
life
of
america
there
are
but
few
whose
names
are
mentioned
as
often
as
that
of
emma
goldman
yet
the
real
emma
goldman
is
almost
quite
unknown
the
sensational
press
has
surrounded
her
name
with
so
much
misrepresentation
and
slander
it
would
seem
almost
a
miracle
that
in
spite
of
this
web
of
calumny
the
truth
breaks
through
and
a
better
appreciation
of
this
much
maligned
idealist
begins
to
manifest
itself
there
is
but
little
consolation
in
the
fact
that
almost
every
representative
of
a
new
idea
has
had
to
struggle
and
suffer
under
similar
difficulties
is
it
of
any
avail
that
a
former
president
of
a
republic
pays
homage
at
osawatomie
to
the
memory
of
john
brown
or
that
the
president
of
another
republic
participates
in
the
unveiling
of
a
statue
in
honor
of
pierre
proudhon
and
holds
up
his
life
to
the
french
nation
as
a
model
worthy
of
enthusiastic
emulation
of
what
avail
is
all
this
when
at
the
same
time
the
living
john
browns
and
proudhons
are
being
crucified
the
honor
and
glory
of
a
mary
wollstonecraft
or
of
a
louise
michel
are
not
enhanced
by
the
city
fathers
of
london
or
paris
naming
a
street
after
them
the
living
generation
should
be
concerned
with
doing
justice
to
the
living
mary
wollstonecrafts
and
louise
michels
posterity
assigns
to
men
like
wendel
phillips
and
lloyd
garrison
the
proper
niche
of
honor
in
the
temple
of
human
emancipation
but
it
is
the
duty
of
their
contemporaries
to
bring
them
due
recognition
and
appreciation
while
they
live
the
path
of
the
propagandist
of
social
justice
is
strewn
with
thorns
the
powers
of
darkness
and
injustice
exert
all
their
might
lest
a
ray
of
sunshine
enter
his
cheerless
life
nay
even
his
comrades
in
the
struggle
indeed
too
often
his
most
intimate
friends
show
but
little
understanding
for
the
personality
of
the
pioneer
envy
sometimes
growing
to
hatred
vanity
and
jealousy
obstruct
his
way
and
fill
his
heart
with
sadness
it
requires
an
inflexible
will
and
tremendous
enthusiasm
not
to
lose
under
such
conditions
all
faith
in
the
cause
the
representative
of
a
revolutionizing
idea
stands
between
two
fires
on
the
one
hand
the
persecution
of
the
existing
powers
which
hold
him
responsible
for
all
acts
resulting
from
social
conditions
and
on
the
other
the
lack
of
understanding
on
the
part
of
his
own
followers
who
often
judge
all
his
activity
from
a
narrow
standpoint
thus
it
happens
that
the
agitator
stands
quite
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
surrounding
him
even
his
most
intimate
friends
rarely
understand
how
solitary
and
deserted
he
feels
that
is
the
tragedy
of
the
person
prominent
in
the
public
eye
the
mist
in
which
the
name
of
emma
goldman
has
so
long
been
enveloped
is
gradually
beginning
to
dissipate
her
energy
in
the
furtherance
of
such
an
unpopular
idea
as
anarchism
her
deep
earnestness
her
courage
and
abilities
find
growing
understanding
and
admiration
the
debt
american
intellectual
growth
owes
to
the
revolutionary
exiles
has
never
been
fully
appreciated
the
seed
disseminated
by
them
though
so
little
understood
at
the
time
has
brought
a
rich
harvest
they
have
at
all
times
held
aloft
the
banner
of
liberty
thus
impregnating
the
social
vitality
of
the
nation
but
very
few
have
succeeding
in
preserving
their
european
education
and
culture
while
at
the
same
time
assimilating
themselves
with
american
life
it
is
difficult
for
the
average
man
to
form
an
adequate
conception
what
strength
energy
and
perseverance
are
necessary
to
absorb
the
unfamiliar
language
habits
and
customs
of
a
new
country
without
the
loss
of
one
own
personality
emma
goldman
is
one
of
the
few
who
while
thoroughly
preserving
their
individuality
have
become
an
important
factor
in
the
social
and
intellectual
atmosphere
of
america
the
life
she
leads
is
rich
in
color
full
of
change
and
variety
she
has
risen
to
the
topmost
heights
and
she
has
also
tasted
the
bitter
dregs
of
life
emma
goldman
was
born
of
jewish
parentage
on
the
day
of
june
in
the
russian
province
of
kovno
surely
these
parents
never
dreamed
what
unique
position
their
child
would
some
day
occupy
like
all
conservative
parents
they
too
were
quite
convinced
that
their
daughter
would
marry
a
respectable
citizen
bear
him
children
and
round
out
her
allotted
years
surrounded
by
a
flock
of
grandchildren
a
good
religious
woman
as
most
parents
they
had
no
inkling
what
a
strange
impassioned
spirit
would
take
hold
of
the
soul
of
their
child
and
carry
it
to
the
heights
which
separate
generations
in
eternal
struggle
they
lived
in
a
land
and
at
a
time
when
antagonism
between
parent
and
offspring
was
fated
to
find
its
most
acute
expression
irreconcilable
hostility
in
this
tremendous
struggle
between
fathers
and
sons
and
especially
between
parents
and
daughters
there
was
no
compromise
no
weak
yielding
no
truce
the
spirit
of
liberty
of
progress
an
idealism
which
knew
no
considerations
and
recognized
no
obstacles
drove
the
young
generation
out
of
the
parental
house
and
away
from
the
hearth
of
the
home
just
as
this
same
spirit
once
drove
out
the
revolutionary
breeder
of
discontent
jesus
and
alienated
him
from
his
native
traditions
what
role
the
jewish
race
notwithstanding
all
calumnies
the
race
of
transcendental
idealism
played
in
the
struggle
of
the
old
and
the
new
will
probably
never
be
appreciated
with
complete
impartiality
and
clarity
only
now
are
we
beginning
to
perceive
the
tremendous
debt
we
owe
to
jewish
idealists
in
the
realm
of
science
art
and
literature
but
very
little
is
still
known
of
the
important
part
the
sons
and
daughters
of
israel
have
played
in
the
revolutionary
movement
and
especially
in
that
of
modern
times
the
first
years
of
her
childhood
emma
goldman
passed
in
a
small
idyllic
place
in
the
province
of
kurland
where
her
father
had
charge
of
the
government
stage
at
the
time
kurland
was
thoroughly
german
even
the
russian
bureaucracy
of
that
baltic
province
was
recruited
mostly
from
german
junkers
german
fairy
tales
and
stories
rich
in
the
miraculous
deeds
of
the
heroic
knights
of
kurland
wove
their
spell
over
the
youthful
mind
but
the
beautiful
idyl
was
of
short
duration
soon
the
soul
of
the
growing
child
was
overcast
by
the
dark
shadows
of
life
already
in
her
tenderest
youth
the
seeds
of
rebellion
and
unrelenting
hatred
of
oppression
were
to
be
planted
in
the
heart
of
emma
goldman
early
she
learned
to
know
the
beauty
of
the
state
she
saw
her
father
harassed
by
the
christian
chinovniks
and
doubly
persecuted
as
petty
official
and
hated
jew
the
brutality
of
forced
conscription
ever
stood
before
her
eyes
she
beheld
the
young
men
often
the
sole
supporter
of
a
large
family
brutally
dragged
to
the
barracks
to
lead
the
miserable
life
of
a
soldier
she
heard
the
weeping
of
the
poor
peasant
women
and
witnessed
the
shameful
scenes
of
official
venality
which
relieved
the
rich
from
military
service
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
she
was
outraged
by
the
terrible
treatment
to
which
the
female
servants
were
subjected
maltreated
and
exploited
by
their
barinyas
they
fell
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
regimental
officers
who
regarded
them
as
their
natural
sexual
prey
the
girls
made
pregnant
by
respectable
gentlemen
and
driven
out
by
their
mistresses
often
found
refuge
in
the
goldman
home
and
the
little
girl
her
heart
palpitating
with
sympathy
would
abstract
coins
from
the
parental
drawer
to
clandestinely
press
the
money
into
the
hands
of
the
unfortunate
women
thus
emma
goldman
most
striking
characteristic
her
sympathy
with
the
underdog
already
became
manifest
in
these
early
years
at
the
age
of
seven
little
emma
was
sent
by
her
parents
to
her
grandmother
at
konigsberg
the
city
of
emanuel
kant
in
eastern
prussia
save
for
occasional
interruptions
she
remained
there
till
her
birthday
the
first
years
in
these
surroundings
do
not
exactly
belong
to
her
happiest
recollections
the
grandmother
indeed
was
very
amiable
but
the
numerous
aunts
of
the
household
were
concerned
more
with
the
spirit
of
practical
rather
than
pure
reason
and
the
categoric
imperative
was
applied
all
too
frequently
the
situation
was
changed
when
her
parents
migrated
to
konigsberg
and
little
emma
was
relieved
from
her
role
of
cinderella
she
now
regularly
attended
public
school
and
also
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
private
instruction
customary
in
middle
class
life
french
and
music
lessons
played
an
important
part
in
the
curriculum
the
future
interpreter
of
ibsen
and
shaw
was
then
a
little
german
gretchen
quite
at
home
in
the
german
atmosphere
her
special
predilections
in
literature
were
the
sentimental
romances
of
marlitt
she
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
good
queen
louise
whom
the
bad
napoleon
buonaparte
treated
with
so
marked
a
lack
of
knightly
chivalry
what
might
have
been
her
future
development
had
she
remained
in
this
milieu
fate
or
was
it
economic
necessity
willed
it
otherwise
her
parents
decided
to
settle
in
petersburg
the
capital
of
the
almighty
tsar
and
there
to
embark
in
business
it
was
here
that
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
life
of
the
young
dreamer
it
was
an
eventful
period
the
year
of
in
which
emma
goldman
then
in
her
year
arrived
in
petersburg
a
struggle
for
life
and
death
between
the
autocracy
and
the
russian
intellectuals

whose
life
the
government
had
reluctantly
spared
because
of
pregnancy
followed
the
unnumbered
russian
martyrs
to
the
etapes
of
siberia
it
was
the
most
heroic
period
in
the
great
battle
of
emancipation
a
battle
for
freedom
such
as
the
world
had
never
witnessed
before
the
names
of
the
nihilist
martyrs
were
on
all
lips
and
thousands
were
enthusiastic
to
follow
their
example
the
whole
intelligenzia
of
russia
was
filled
with
the
illegal
spirit
revolutionary
sentiments
penetrated
into
every
home
from
mansion
to
hovel
impregnating
the
military
the
chinovniks
factory
workers
and
peasants
the
atmosphere
pierced
the
very
casemates
of
the
royal
palace
new
ideas
germinated
in
the
youth
the
difference
of
sex
was
forgotten
shoulder
to
shoulder
fought
the
men
and
the
women
the
russian
woman
who
shall
ever
do
justice
or
adequately
portray
her
heroism
and
her
loyalty
and
devotion
holy
turgeniev
calls
her
in
his
great
prose
poem
on
the
threshold
it
was
inevitable
that
the
young
dreamer
from
konigsberg
should
be
drawn
into
the
maelstrom
to
remain
outside
of
the
circle
of
free
ideas
meant
a
life
of
vegetation
of
death
one
need
not
wonder
at
the
youthful
age
young
enthusiasts
were
not
then
and
fortunately
are
not
now
a
rare
phenomenon
in
russia
the
study
of
the
russian
language
soon
brought
young
emma
goldman
in
touch
with
revolutionary
students
and
new
ideas
the
place
of
marlitt
was
taken
by
nekrassov
and
tchernishevsky
the
quondam
admirer
of
the
good
queen
louise
became
a
glowing
enthusiast
of
liberty
resolving
like
thousands
of
others
to
devote
her
life
to
the
emancipation
of
the
people
the
struggle
of
generations
now
took
place
in
the
goldman
family
the
parents
could
not
comprehend
what
interest
their
daughter
could
find
in
the
new
ideas
which
they
themselves
considered
fantastic
utopias
they
strove
to
persuade
the
young
girl
out
of
these
chimeras
and
daily
repetition
of
disputes
was
the
result
only
in
one
member
of
the
family
did
the
young
idealist
find
understanding
in
her
elder
sister
helene
with
whom
she
later
emigrated
to
america
and
whose
love
and
sympathy
have
never
failed
her
even
in
the
darkest
hours
of
later
persecution
emma
goldman
always
found
a
haven
of
refuge
in
the
home
of
this
loyal
sister
emma
goldman
finally
resolved
to
achieve
her
independence
she
saw
hundreds
of
men
and
women
sacrificing
brilliant
careers
to
go
v
narod
to
the
people
she
followed
their
example
she
became
a
factory
worker
at
first
employed
as
a
corset
maker
and
later
in
the
manufacture
of
gloves
she
was
now
years
of
age
and
proud
to
earn
her
own
living
had
she
remained
in
russia
she
would
have
probably
sooner
or
later
shared
the
fate
of
thousands
buried
in
the
snows
of
siberia
but
a
new
chapter
of
life
was
to
begin
for
her
sister
helene
decided
to
emigrate
to
america
where
another
sister
had
already
made
her
home
emma
prevailed
upon
helene
to
be
allowed
to
join
her
and
together
they
departed
for
america
filled
with
the
joyous
hope
of
a
great
free
land
the
glorious
republic
america
what
magic
word
the
yearning
of
the
enslaved
the
promised
land
of
the
oppressed
the
goal
of
all
longing
for
progress
here
man
ideals
had
found
their
fulfillment
no
tsar
no
cossack
no
chinovnik
the
republic
glorious
synonym
of
equality
freedom
brotherhood
thus
thought
the
two
girls
as
they
travelled
in
the
year
from
new
york
to
rochester
soon
all
too
soon
disillusionment
awaited
them
the
ideal
conception
of
america
was
punctured
already
at
castle
garden
and
soon
burst
like
a
soap
bubble
here
emma
goldman
witnessed
sights
which
reminded
her
of
the
terrible
scenes
of
her
childhood
in
kurland
the
brutality
and
humiliation
the
future
citizens
of
the
great
republic
were
subjected
to
on
board
ship
were
repeated
at
castle
garden
by
the
officials
of
the
democracy
in
a
more
savage
and
aggravating
manner
and
what
bitter
disappointment
followed
as
the
young
idealist
began
to
familiarize
herself
with
the
conditions
in
the
new
land
instead
of
one
tsar
she
found
scores
of
them
the
cossack
was
replaced
by
the
policeman
with
the
heavy
club
and
instead
of
the
russian
chinovnik
there
was
the
far
more
inhuman
of
the
factory
emma
goldman
soon
obtained
work
in
the
clothing
establishment
of
the
garson
co
the
wages
amounted
to
two
and
a
half
dollars
a
week
at
that
time
the
factories
were
not
provided
with
motor
power
and
the
poor
sewing
girls
had
to
drive
the
wheels
by
foot
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
a
terribly
exhausting
toil
it
was
without
a
ray
of
light
the
drudgery
of
the
long
day
passed
in
complete
silence
the
russian
custom
of
friendly
conversation
at
work
was
not
permissible
in
the
free
country
but
the
exploitation
of
the
girls
was
not
only
economic
the
poor
wage
workers
were
looked
upon
by
their
foremen
and
bosses
as
sexual
commodities
if
a
girl
resented
the
advances
of
her
superiors
she
would
speedily
find
herself
on
the
street
as
an
undesirable
element
in
the
factory
there
was
never
a
lack
of
willing
victims
the
supply
always
exceeded
the
demand
the
horrible
conditions
were
made
still
more
unbearable
by
the
fearful
dreariness
of
life
in
the
small
american
city
the
puritan
spirit
suppresses
the
slightest
manifestation
of
joy
a
deadly
dullness
beclouds
the
soul
no
intellectual
inspiration
no
thought
exchange
between
congenial
spirits
is
possible
emma
goldman
almost
suffocated
in
this
atmosphere
she
above
all
others
longed
for
ideal
surroundings
for
friendship
and
understanding
for
the
companionship
of
kindred
minds
mentally
she
still
lived
in
russia
unfamiliar
with
the
language
and
life
of
the
country
she
dwelt
more
in
the
past
than
in
the
present
it
was
at
this
period
that
she
met
a
young
man
who
spoke
russian
with
great
joy
the
acquaintance
was
cultivated
at
last
a
person
with
whom
she
could
converse
one
who
could
help
her
bridge
the
dullness
of
the
narrow
existence
the
friendship
gradually
ripened
and
finally
culminated
in
marriage
emma
goldman
too
had
to
walk
the
sorrowful
road
of
married
life
she
too
had
to
learn
from
bitter
experience
that
legal
statutes
signify
dependence
and
especially
for
the
woman
the
marriage
was
no
liberation
from
the
puritan
dreariness
of
american
life
indeed
it
was
rather
aggravated
by
the
loss
of
the
characters
of
the
young
people
differed
too
widely
a
separation
soon
followed
and
emma
goldman
went
to
new
haven
conn
there
she
found
employment
in
a
factory
and
her
husband
disappeared
from
her
horizon
two
decades
later
she
was
fated
to
be
unexpectedly
reminded
of
him
by
the
federal
authorities
the
revolutionists
who
were
active
in
the
russian
movement
of
the
were
but
little
familiar
with
the
social
ideas
then
agitating
western
europe
and
america
their
sole
activity
consisted
in
educating
the
people
their
final
goal
the
destruction
of
the
autocracy
socialism
and
anarchism
were
terms
hardly
known
even
by
name
emma
goldman
too
was
entirely
unfamiliar
with
the
significance
of
those
ideals
she
arrived
in
america
as
four
years
previously
in
russia
at
a
period
of
great
social
and
political
unrest
the
working
people
were
in
revolt
against
the
terrible
labor
conditions
the
movement
of
the
knights
of
labor
was
at
its
height
and
throughout
the
country
echoed
the
din
of
sanguine
strife
between
strikers
and
police
the
struggle
culminated
in
the
great
strike
against
the
harvester
company
of
chicago
the
massacre
of
the
strikers
and
the
judicial
murder
of
the
labor
leaders
which
followed
upon
the
historic
haymarket
bomb
explosion
the
anarchists
stood
the
martyr
test
of
blood
baptism
the
apologists
of
capitalism
vainly
seek
to
justify
the
killing
of
parsons
spies
lingg
fischer
and
engel
since
the
publication
of
governor
altgeld
reason
for
his
liberation
of
the
three
incarcerated
haymarket
anarchists
no
doubt
is
left
that
a
fivefold
legal
murder
had
been
committed
in
chicago
in
very
few
have
grasped
the
significance
of
the
chicago
martyrdom
least
of
all
the
ruling
classes
by
the
destruction
of
a
number
of
labor
leaders
they
thought
to
stem
the
tide
of
a
idea
they
failed
to
consider
that
from
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
grows
the
new
seed
and
that
the
frightful
injustice
will
win
new
converts
to
the
cause
the
two
most
prominent
representatives
of
the
anarchist
idea
in
america
voltairine
de
cleyre
and
emma
goldman
the
one
a
native
american
the
other
a
russian
have
been
converted
like
numerous
others
to
the
ideas
of
anarchism
by
the
judicial
murder
two
women
who
had
not
known
each
other
before
and
who
had
received
a
widely
different
education
were
through
that
murder
united
in
one
idea
like
most
working
men
and
women
of
america
emma
goldman
followed
the
chicago
trial
with
great
anxiety
and
excitement
she
too
could
not
believe
that
the
leaders
of
the
proletariat
would
be
killed
the
of
november
taught
her
differently
she
realized
that
no
mercy
could
be
expected
from
the
ruling
class
that
between
the
tsarism
of
russia
and
the
plutocracy
of
america
there
was
no
difference
save
in
name
her
whole
being
rebelled
against
the
crime
and
she
vowed
to
herself
a
solemn
vow
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
revolutionary
proletariat
and
to
devote
all
her
energy
and
strength
to
their
emancipation
from
wage
slavery
with
the
glowing
enthusiasm
so
characteristic
of
her
nature
she
now
began
to
familiarize
herself
with
the
literature
of
socialism
and
anarchism
she
attended
public
meetings
and
became
acquainted
with
socialistically
and
anarchistically
inclined
workingmen
johanna
greie
the
german
lecturer
was
the
first
socialist
speaker
heard
by
emma
goldman
in
new
haven
where
she
was
employed
in
a
corset
factory
she
met
anarchists
actively
participating
in
the
movement
here
she
read
the
freiheit
edited
by
john
most
the
haymarket
tragedy
developed
her
inherent
anarchist
tendencies
the
reading
of
the
freiheit
made
her
a
conscious
anarchist
subsequently
she
was
to
learn
that
the
idea
of
anarchism
found
its
highest
expression
through
the
best
intellects
of
america
theoretically
by
josiah
warren
stephen
pearl
andrews
lysander
spooner
philosophically
by
emerson
thoreau
and
walt
whitman
made
ill
by
the
excessive
strain
of
factory
work
emma
goldman
returned
to
rochester
where
she
remained
till
august
at
which
time
she
removed
to
new
york
the
scene
of
the
most
important
phase
of
her
life
she
was
now
twenty
years
old
features
pallid
with
suffering
eyes
large
and
full
of
compassion
greet
one
in
her
pictured
likeness
of
those
days
her
hair
is
as
customary
with
russian
student
girls
worn
short
giving
free
play
to
the
strong
forehead
it
is
the
heroic
epoch
of
militant
anarchism
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
movement
had
grown
in
every
country
in
spite
of
the
most
severe
governmental
persecution
new
converts
swell
the
ranks
the
propaganda
is
almost
exclusively
of
a
secret
character
the
repressive
measures
of
the
government
drive
the
disciples
of
the
new
philosophy
to
conspirative
methods
thousands
of
victims
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
authorities
and
languish
in
prisons
but
nothing
can
stem
the
rising
tide
of
enthusiasm
of
and
devotion
to
the
cause
the
efforts
of
teachers
like
peter
kropotkin
louise
michel
elisee
reclus
and
others
inspire
the
devotees
with
ever
greater
energy
disruption
is
imminent
with
the
socialists
who
have
sacrificed
the
idea
of
liberty
and
embraced
the
state
and
politics
the
struggle
is
bitter
the
factions
irreconcilable
this
struggle
is
not
merely
between
anarchists
and
socialists
it
also
finds
its
echo
within
the
anarchist
groups
theoretic
differences
and
personal
controversies
lead
to
strife
and
acrimonious
enmities
the
legislation
of
germany
and
austria
had
driven
thousands
of
socialists
and
anarchists
across
the
seas
to
seek
refuge
in
america
john
most
having
lost
his
seat
in
the
reichstag
finally
had
to
flee
his
native
land
and
went
to
london
there
having
advanced
toward
anarchism
he
entirely
withdrew
from
the
social
democratic
party
later
coming
to
america
he
continued
the
publication
of
the
freiheit
in
new
york
and
developed
great
activity
among
the
german
workingmen
when
emma
goldman
arrived
in
new
york
in
she
experienced
little
difficulty
in
associating
herself
with
active
anarchists
anarchist
meetings
were
an
almost
daily
occurrence
the
first
lecturer
she
heard
on
the
anarchist
platform
was
solotaroff
of
great
importance
to
her
future
development
was
her
acquaintance
with
john
most
who
exerted
a
tremendous
influence
over
the
younger
elements
his
impassioned
eloquence
untiring
energy
and
the
persecution
he
had
endured
for
the
cause
all
combined
to
enthuse
the
comrades
it
was
also
at
this
period
that
she
met
alexander
berkman
whose
friendship
played
an
important
part
throughout
her
life
her
talents
as
a
speaker
could
not
long
remain
in
obscurity
the
fire
of
enthusiasm
swept
her
toward
the
public
platform
encouraged
by
her
friends
she
began
to
participate
as
a
german
and
yiddish
speaker
at
anarchist
meetings
soon
followed
a
brief
tour
of
agitation
taking
her
as
far
as
cleveland
with
the
whole
strength
and
earnestness
of
her
soul
she
now
threw
herself
into
the
propaganda
of
anarchist
ideas
the
passionate
period
of
her
life
had
begun
through
constantly
toiling
in
sweat
shops
the
fiery
young
orator
was
at
the
same
time
very
active
as
an
agitator
and
participated
in
various
labor
struggles
notably
in
the
great
cloakmakers
strike
in
led
by
professor
garsyde
and
joseph
barondess
a
year
later
emma
goldman
was
a
delegate
to
an
anarchist
conference
in
new
york
she
was
elected
to
the
executive
committee
but
later
withdrew
because
of
differences
of
opinion
regarding
tactical
matters
the
ideas
of
the
anarchists
had
at
that
time
not
yet
become
clarified
some
still
believed
in
parliamentary
methods
the
great
majority
being
adherents
of
strong
centralism
these
differences
of
opinion
in
regard
to
tactics
led
in
to
a
breach
with
john
most
emma
goldman
alexander
berkman
and
other
comrades
joined
the
group
autonomy
in
which
joseph
peukert
otto
rinke
and
claus
timmermann
played
an
active
part
the
bitter
controversies
which
followed
this
secession
terminated
only
with
the
death
of
most
in
a
great
source
of
inspiration
to
emma
goldman
proved
the
russian
revolutionists
who
were
associated
in
the
group
znamya
goldenberg
solotaroff
zametkin
miller
cahan
the
poet
edelstadt
ivan
von
schewitsch
husband
of
helene
von
racowitza
and
editor
of
the
volkszeitung
and
numerous
other
russian
exiles
some
of
whom
are
still
living
were
members
of
this
group
it
was
also
at
this
time
that
emma
goldman
met
robert
reitzel
the
heine
who
exerted
a
great
influence
on
her
development
through
him
she
became
acquainted
with
the
best
writers
of
modern
literature
and
the
friendship
thus
begun
lasted
till
reitzel
death
in
the
labor
movement
of
america
had
not
been
drowned
in
the
chicago
massacre
the
murder
of
the
anarchists
had
failed
to
bring
peace
to
the
capitalist
the
struggle
for
the
day
continued
in
broke
out
the
great
strike
in
pittsburg
the
homestead
fight
the
defeat
of
the
pinkertons
the
appearance
of
the
militia
the
suppression
of
the
strikers
and
the
complete
triumph
of
the
reaction
are
matters
of
comparatively
recent
history
stirred
to
the
very
depths
by
the
terrible
events
at
the
seat
of
war
alexander
berkman
resolved
to
sacrifice
his
life
to
the
cause
and
thus
give
an
object
lesson
to
the
wage
slaves
of
america
of
active
anarchist
solidarity
with
labor
his
attack
upon
frick
the
gessler
of
pittsburg
failed
and
the
youth
was
doomed
to
a
living
death
of
years
in
the
penitentiary
the
bourgeoisie
which
for
decades
had
exalted
and
eulogized
tyrannicide
now
was
filled
with
terrible
rage
the
capitalist
press
organized
a
systematic
campaign
of
calumny
and
misrepresentation
against
anarchists
the
police
exerted
every
effort
to
involve
emma
goldman
in
the
act
of
alexander
berkman
the
feared
agitator
was
to
be
silenced
by
all
means
it
was
only
due
to
the
circumstance
of
her
presence
in
new
york
that
she
escaped
the
clutches
of
the
law
it
was
a
similar
circumstance
which
nine
years
later
during
the
mckinley
incident
was
instrumental
in
preserving
her
liberty
it
is
almost
incredible
with
what
amount
of
stupidity
baseness
and
vileness
the
journalists
of
the
period
sought
to
overwhelm
the
anarchist
one
must
peruse
the
newspaper
files
to
realize
the
enormity
of
incrimination
and
slander
it
would
be
difficult
to
portray
the
agony
of
soul
emma
goldman
experienced
in
those
days
the
persecutions
of
the
capitalist
press
were
to
be
borne
by
an
anarchist
with
comparative
equanimity
but
the
attacks
from
one
own
ranks
were
far
more
painful
and
unbearable
the
act
of
berkman
was
severely
criticized
by
most
and
some
of
his
followers
among
the
german
and
jewish
anarchists
bitter
accusations
and
recriminations
at
public
meetings
and
private
gatherings
followed
persecuted
on
all
sides
both
because
she
championed
berkman
and
his
act
and
on
account
of
her
revolutionary
activity
emma
goldman
was
harassed
even
to
the
extent
of
inability
to
secure
shelter
too
proud
to
seek
safety
in
the
denial
of
her
identity
she
chose
to
pass
the
nights
in
the
public
parks
rather
than
expose
her
friends
to
danger
or
vexation
by
her
visits
the
already
bitter
cup
was
filled
to
overflowing
by
the
attempted
suicide
of
a
young
comrade
who
had
shared
living
quarters
with
emma
goldman
alexander
berkman
and
a
mutual
artist
friend
many
changes
have
since
taken
place
alexander
berkman
has
survived
the
pennsylvania
inferno
and
is
back
again
in
the
ranks
of
the
militant
anarchists
his
spirit
unbroken
his
soul
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
ideals
of
his
youth
the
artist
comrade
is
now
among
the
illustrators
of
new
york
the
suicide
candidate
left
america
shortly
after
his
unfortunate
attempt
to
die
and
was
subsequently
arrested
and
condemned
to
eight
years
of
hard
labor
for
smuggling
anarchist
literature
into
germany
he
too
has
withstood
the
terrors
of
prison
life
and
has
returned
to
the
revolutionary
movement
since
earning
the
well
deserved
reputation
of
a
talented
writer
in
germany
to
avoid
indefinite
camping
in
the
parks
emma
goldman
finally
was
forced
to
move
into
a
house
on
third
street
occupied
exclusively
by
prostitutes
there
among
the
outcasts
of
our
good
christian
society
she
could
at
least
rent
a
bit
of
a
room
and
find
rest
and
work
at
her
sewing
machine
the
women
of
the
street
showed
more
refinement
of
feeling
and
sincere
sympathy
than
the
priests
of
the
church
but
human
endurance
had
been
exhausted
by
overmuch
suffering
and
privation
there
was
a
complete
physical
breakdown
and
the
renowned
agitator
was
removed
to
the
bohemian
republic
a
large
tenement
house
which
derived
its
euphonious
appellation
from
the
fact
that
its
occupants
were
mostly
bohemian
anarchists
here
emma
goldman
found
friends
ready
to
aid
her
justus
schwab
one
of
the
finest
representatives
of
the
german
revolutionary
period
of
that
time
and
solotaroff
were
indefatigable
in
the
care
of
the
patient
here
too
she
met
edward
brady
the
new
friendship
subsequently
ripening
into
close
intimacy
brady
had
been
an
active
participant
in
the
revolutionary
movement
of
austria
and
had
at
the
time
of
his
acquaintance
with
emma
goldman
lately
been
released
from
an
austrian
prison
after
an
incarceration
of
ten
years
physicians
diagnosed
the
illness
as
consumption
and
the
patient
was
advised
to
leave
new
york
she
went
to
rochester
in
the
hope
that
the
home
circle
would
help
restore
her
to
health
her
parents
had
several
years
previously
emigrated
to
america
settling
in
that
city
among
the
leading
traits
of
the
jewish
race
is
the
strong
attachment
between
the
members
of
the
family
and
especially
between
parents
and
children
though
her
conservative
parents
could
not
sympathize
with
the
idealist
aspirations
of
emma
goldman
and
did
not
approve
of
her
mode
of
life
they
now
received
their
sick
daughter
with
open
arms
the
rest
and
care
enjoyed
in
the
parental
home
and
the
cheering
presence
of
the
beloved
sister
helene
proved
so
beneficial
that
within
a
short
time
she
was
sufficiently
restored
to
resume
her
energetic
activity
there
is
no
rest
in
the
life
of
emma
goldman
ceaseless
effort
and
continuous
striving
toward
the
conceived
goal
are
the
essentials
of
her
nature
too
much
precious
time
had
already
been
wasted
it
was
imperative
to
resume
her
labors
immediately
the
country
was
in
the
throes
of
a
crisis
and
thousands
of
unemployed
crowded
the
streets
of
the
large
industrial
centers
cold
and
hungry
they
tramped
through
the
land
in
the
vain
search
for
work
and
bread
the
anarchists
developed
a
strenuous
propaganda
among
the
unemployed
and
the
strikers
a
monster
demonstration
of
striking
cloakmakers
and
of
the
unemployed
took
place
at
union
square
new
york
emma
goldman
was
one
of
the
invited
speakers
she
delivered
an
impassioned
speech
picturing
in
fiery
words
the
misery
of
the
wage
slave
life
and
quoted
the
famous
maxim
of
cardinal
manning
necessity
knows
no
law
and
the
starving
man
has
a
natural
right
to
a
share
of
his
neighbor
bread
she
concluded
her
exhortation
with
the
words
ask
for
work
if
they
do
not
give
you
work
ask
for
bread
if
they
do
not
give
you
work
or
bread
then
take
bread
the
following
day
she
left
for
philadelphia
where
she
was
to
address
a
public
meeting
the
capitalist
press
again
raised
the
alarm
if
socialists
and
anarchists
were
to
be
permitted
to
continue
agitating
there
was
imminent
danger
that
the
workingmen
would
soon
learn
to
understand
the
manner
in
which
they
are
robbed
of
the
joy
and
happiness
of
life
such
a
possibility
was
to
be
prevented
at
all
cost
the
chief
of
police
of
new
york
byrnes
procured
a
court
order
for
the
arrest
of
emma
goldman
she
was
detained
by
the
philadelphia
authorities
and
incarcerated
for
several
days

offered
lucrative

imagine
the
possibility

not

with

greater
success
than

in
the

of

reached
its
highest
expression
the

part

by
the

with

the

throughout

followed
this

its
reverberating
echo
in
almost
all
countries
in
order
to
better
familiarize

with
conditions
in
the
old
world
emma
goldman
left
for
europe
in
the
year
after
a
lecture
tour
in
england
and
scotland
she
went
to
vienna
where
she
entered
the
allgemeine
krankenhaus
to
prepare
herself
as
midwife
and
nurse
and
where
at
the
same
time
she
studied
social
conditions
she
also
found
opportunity
to
acquaint
herself
with
the
newest
literature
of
europe
hauptmann
nietzsche
ibsen
zola
thomas
hardy
and
other
artist
rebels
were
read
with
great
enthusiasm
in
the
autumn
of
she
returned
to
new
york
by
way
of
zurich
and
paris
the
project
of
alexander
berkman
liberation
was
on
hand
the
barbaric
sentence
of
years
had
roused
tremendous
indignation
among
the
radical
elements
it
was
known
that
the
pardon
board
of
pennsylvania
would
look
to
carnegie
and
frick
for
advice
in
the
case
of
alexander
berkman
it
was
therefore
suggested
that
these
sultans
of
pennsylvania
be
approached
not
with
a
view
of
obtaining
their
grace
but
with
the
request
that
they
do
not
attempt
to
influence
the
board
ernest
crosby
offered
to
see
carnegie
on
condition
that
alexander
berkman
repudiate
his
act
that
however
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
he
would
never
be
guilty
of
such
forswearing
of
his
own
personality
and
these
efforts
led
to
friendly
relations
between
emma
goldman
and
the
circle
of
ernest
crosby
bolton
hall
and
leonard
abbott
in
the
year
she
undertook
her
first
great
lecture
tour
which
extended
as
far
as
california
this
tour
popularized
her
name
as
the
representative
of
the
oppressed
her
eloquence
ringing
from
coast
to
coast
in
california
emma
goldman
became
friendly
with
the
members
of
the
isaak
family
and
learned
to
appreciate
their
efforts
for
the
cause
under
tremendous
obstacles
the
isaaks
first
published
the
firebrand
and
upon
its
suppression
by
the
postal
department
the
free
society
it
was
also
during
this
tour
that
emma
goldman
met
that
grand
old
rebel
of
sexual
freedom
moses
harman
during
the
war
the
spirit
of
chauvinism
was
at
its
highest
tide
to
check
this
dangerous
situation
and
at
the
same
time
collect
funds
for
the
revolutionary
cubans
emma
goldman
became
affiliated
with
the
latin
comrades
among
others
with
gori
esteve
palaviccini
merlino
petruccini
and
ferrara
in
the
year
followed
another
protracted
tour
of
agitation
terminating
on
the
pacific
coast
repeated
arrests
and
accusations
though
without
ultimate
bad
results
marked
every
propaganda
tour
in
november
of
the
same
year
the
untiring
agitator
went
on
a
second
lecture
tour
to
england
and
scotland
closing
her
journey
with
the
first
international
anarchist
congress
at
paris
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
and
again
jingoism
was
at
its
height
as
two
years
previously
it
had
celebrated
its
orgies
during
the
war
various
meetings
both
in
england
and
scotland
were
disturbed
and
broken
up
by
patriotic
mobs
emma
goldman
found
on
this
occasion
the
opportunity
of
again
meeting
various
english
comrades
and
interesting
personalities
like
tom
mann
and
the
sisters
rossetti
the
gifted
daughters
of
dante
gabriel
rossetti
then
publishers
of
the
anarchist
review
the
torch
one
of
her
hopes
found
here
its
fulfillment
she
came
in
close
and
friendly
touch
with
peter
kropotkin
enrico
malatesta
nicholas
tchaikovsky
tcherkessov
and
louise
michel
old
warriors
in
the
cause
of
humanity
whose
deeds
have
enthused
thousands
of
followers
throughout
the
world
and
whose
life
and
work
have
inspired
other
thousands
with
noble
idealism
and
old
warriors
they
yet
ever
young
with
the
courage
of
earlier
days
unbroken
in
spirit
and
filled
with
the
firm
hope
of
the
final
triumph
of
anarchy
the
chasm
in
the
revolutionary
labor
movement
which
resulted
from
the
disruption
of
the
internationale
could
not
be
bridged
any
more
two
social
philosophies
were
engaged
in
bitter
combat
the
international
congress
in
at
paris
in
at
zurich
and
in
at
london
produced
irreconcilable
differences
the
majority
of
social
democrats
forswearing
their
libertarian
past
and
becoming
politicians
succeeded
in
excluding
the
revolutionary
and
anarchist
delegates
the
latter
decided
thenceforth
to
hold
separate
congresses
their
first
congress
was
to
take
place
in
at
paris
the
socialist
renegade
millerand
who
had
climbed
into
the
ministry
of
the
interior
here
played
a
judas
role
the
congress
of
the
revolutionists
was
suppressed
and
the
delegates
dispersed
two
days
prior
to
their
scheduled
opening
but
millerand
had
no
objections
against
the
social
democratic
congress
which
was
afterwards
opened
with
all
the
trumpets
of
the
advertiser
art
however
the
renegade
did
not
accomplish
his
object
a
number
of
delegates
succeeded
in
holding
a
secret
conference
in
the
house
of
a
comrade
outside
of
paris
where
various
points
of
theory
and
tactics
were
discussed
emma
goldman
took
considerable
part
in
these
proceedings
and
on
that
occasion
came
in
contact
with
numerous
representatives
of
the
anarchist
movement
of
europe
owing
to
the
suppression
of
the
congress
the
delegates
were
in
danger
of
being
expelled
from
france
at
this
time
also
came
the
bad
news
from
america
regarding
another
unsuccessful
attempt
to
liberate
alexander
berkman
proving
a
great
shock
to
emma
goldman
in
november
she
returned
to
america
to
devote
herself
to
her
profession
of
nurse
at
the
same
time
taking
an
active
part
in
the
american
propaganda
among
other
activities
she
organized
monster
meetings
of
protest
against
the
terrible
outrages
of
the
spanish
government
perpetrated
upon
the
political
prisoners
tortured
in
montjuich
in
her
vocation
as
nurse
emma
goldman
enjoyed
many
opportunities
of
meeting
the
most
unusual
and
peculiar
characters
few
would
have
identified
the
notorious
anarchist
in
the
small
blonde
woman
simply
attired
in
the
uniform
of
a
nurse
soon
after
her
return
from
europe
she
became
acquainted
with
a
patient
by
the
name
of
stander
a
morphine
fiend
suffering
excruciating
agonies
she
required
careful
attention
to
enable
her
to
supervise
a
very
important
business
she
conducted
that
of
warren
in
third
street
near
third
avenue
was
situated
her
private
residence
and
near
it
connected
by
a
separate
entrance
was
her
place
of
business
one
evening
the
nurse
upon
entering
the
room
of
her
patient
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
a
male
visitor
and
of
brutal
appearance
the
man
was
no
other
than
jacobs
the
detective
who
seven
years
previously
had
brought
emma
goldman
a
prisoner
from
philadelphia
and
who
had
attempted
to
persuade
her
on
their
way
to
new
york
to
betray
the
cause
of
the
workingmen
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
expression
of
bewilderment
on
the
countenance
of
the
man
as
he
so
unexpectedly
faced
emma
goldman
the
nurse
of
his
mistress
the
brute
was
suddenly
transformed
into
a
gentleman
exerting
himself
to
excuse
his
shameful
behavior
on
the
previous
occasion
jacobs
was
the
protector
of
stander
and
for
the
house
and
the
police
several
years
later
as
one
of
the
detective
staff
of
district
attorney
jerome
he
committed
perjury
was
convicted
and
sent
to
sing
sing
for
a
year
he
is
now
probably
employed
by
some
private
detective
agency
a
desirable
pillar
of
respectable
society
in
peter
kropotkin
was
invited
by
the
lowell
institute
of
massachusetts
to
deliver
a
series
of
lectures
on
russian
literature
it
was
his
second
american
tour
and
naturally
the
comrades
were
anxious
to
use
his
presence
for
the
benefit
of
the
movement
emma
goldman
entered
into
correspondence
with
kropotkin
and
succeeded
in
securing
his
consent
to
arrange
for
him
a
series
of
lectures
she
also
devoted
her
energies
to
organizing
the
tours
of
other
well
known
anarchists
principally
those
of
charles
mowbray
and
john
turner
similarly
she
always
took
part
in
all
the
activities
of
the
movement
ever
ready
to
give
her
time
ability
and
energy
to
the
cause
on
the
sixth
of
september
president
mckinley
was
shot
by
leon
czolgosz
at
buffalo
immediately
an
unprecedented
campaign
of
persecution
was
set
in
motion
against
emma
goldman
as
the
best
known
anarchist
in
the
country
although
there
was
absolutely
no
foundation
for
the
accusation
she
together
with
other
prominent
anarchists
was
arrested
in
chicago
kept
in
confinement
for
several
weeks
and
subjected
to
severest
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
country
had
such
a
terrible
taken
place
against
a
person
in
public
life
but
the
efforts
of
police
and
press
to
connect
emma
goldman
with
czolgosz
proved
futile
yet
the
episode
left
her
wounded
to
the
heart
the
physical
suffering
the
humiliation
and
brutality
at
the
hands
of
the
police
she
could
bear
the
depression
of
soul
was
far
worse
she
was
overwhelmed
by
realization
of
the
stupidity
lack
of
understanding
and
vileness
which
characterized
the
events
of
those
terrible
days
the
attitude
of
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
the
majority
of
her
own
comrades
toward
czolgosz
almost
drove
her
to
desperation
stirred
to
the
very
inmost
of
her
soul
she
published
an
article
on
czolgosz
in
which
she
tried
to
explain
the
deed
in
its
social
and
individual
aspects
as
once
before
after
berkman
act
she
now
also
was
unable
to
find
quarters
like
a
veritable
wild
animal
she
was
driven
from
place
to
place
this
terrible
persecution
and
especially
the
attitude
of
her
comrades
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
continue
propaganda
the
soreness
of
body
and
soul
had
first
to
heal
during
she
did
not
resume
the
platform
as
miss
smith
she
lived
a
quiet
life
practicing
her
profession
and
devoting
her
leisure
to
the
study
of
literature
and
particularly
to
the
modern
drama
which
she
considers
one
of
the
greatest
disseminators
of
radical
ideas
and
enlightened
feeling
yet
one
thing
the
persecution
of
emma
goldman
accomplished
her
name
was
brought
before
the
public
with
greater
frequency
and
emphasis
than
ever
before
the
malicious
harassing
of
the
much
maligned
agitator
arousing
strong
sympathy
in
many
circles
persons
in
various
walks
of
life
began
to
get
interested
in
her
struggle
and
her
ideas
a
better
understanding
and
appreciation
were
now
beginning
to
manifest
themselves
the
arrival
in
america
of
the
english
anarchist
john
turner
induced
emma
goldman
to
leave
her
retirement
again
she
threw
herself
into
her
public
activities
organizing
an
energetic
movement
for
the
defense
of
turner
whom
the
immigration
authorities
condemned
to
deportation
on
account
of
the
anarchist
exclusion
law
passed
after
the
death
of
mckinley
when
paul
orleneff
and
mme
nazimova
arrived
in
new
york
to
acquaint
the
american
public
with
russian
dramatic
art
emma
goldman
became
the
manager
of
the
undertaking
by
much
patience
and
perseverance
she
succeeded
in
raising
the
necessary
funds
to
introduce
the
russian
artists
to
the
of
new
york
and
chicago
though
financially
not
a
success
the
venture
proved
of
great
artistic
value
as
manager
of
the
russian
theater
emma
goldman
enjoyed
some
unique
experiences
orleneff
could
converse
only
in
russian
and
miss
smith
was
forced
to
act
as
his
interpreter
at
various
polite
functions
most
of
the
aristocratic
ladies
of
fifth
avenue
had
not
the
least
inkling
that
the
amiable
manager
who
so
entertainingly
discussed
philosophy
drama
and
literature
at
their
five
teas
was
the
notorious
emma
goldman
if
the
latter
should
some
day
write
her
autobiography
she
will
no
doubt
have
many
interesting
anecdotes
to
relate
in
connection
with
these
experiences
the
weekly
anarchist
publication
free
society
issued
by
the
isaak
family
was
forced
to
suspend
in
consequence
of
the
fury
that
swept
the
country
after
the
death
of
mckinley
to
fill
out
the
gap
emma
goldman
in
with
max
baginski
and
other
comrades
decided
to
publish
a
monthly
magazine
devoted
to
the
furtherance
of
anarchist
ideas
in
life
and
literature
the
first
issue
of
mother
earth
appeared
in
the
month
of
march
the
initial
expenses
of
the
periodical
partly
covered
by
the
proceeds
of
a
theater
benefit
given
by

and
their
company
in
favor
of
the
anarchist
magazine
under
tremendous
difficulties
and
obstacles
the
tireless
propagandist
has
succeeded
in
continuing
mother
earth
uninterruptedly
since
an
achievement
rarely
equalled
in
the
annals
of
radical
publications
in
may
alexander
berkman
at
last
left
the
hell
of
pennsylvania
where
he
had
passed
the
best
fourteen
years
of
his
life
no
one
had
believed
in
the
possibility
of
his
survival
his
liberation
terminated
a
nightmare
of
fourteen
years
for
emma
goldman
and
an
important
chapter
of
her
career
was
thus
concluded
nowhere
had
the
birth
of
the
russian
revolution
aroused
such
vital
and
active
response
as
among
the
russians
living
in
america
the
heroes
of
the
revolutionary
movement
in
russia
tchaikovsky
mme
breshkovskaia
gershuni
and
others
visited
these
shores
to
waken
the
sympathies
of
the
american
people
toward
the
struggle
for
liberty
and
to
collect
aid
for
its
continuance
and
support
the
success
of
these
efforts
was
to
a
considerable
extent
due
to
the
exertions
eloquence
and
the
talent
for
organization
on
the
part
of
emma
goldman
this
opportunity
enabled
her
to
give
valuable
services
to
the
struggle
for
liberty
in
her
native
land
it
is
not
generally
known
that
it
is
the
anarchists
who
are
mainly
instrumental
in
insuring
the
success
moral
as
well
as
financial
of
most
of
the
radical
undertakings
the
anarchist
is
indifferent
to
acknowledged
appreciation
the
needs
of
the
cause
absorb
his
whole
interest
and
to
these
he
devotes
his
energy
and
abilities
yet
it
may
be
mentioned
that
some
otherwise
decent
folks
though
at
all
times
anxious
for
anarchist
support
and
are
ever
willing
to
monopolize
all
the
credit
for
the
work
done
during
the
last
several
decades
it
was
chiefly
the
anarchists
who
had
organized
all
the
great
revolutionary
efforts
and
aided
in
every
struggle
for
liberty
but
for
fear
of
shocking
the
respectable
mob
who
looks
upon
the
anarchists
as
the
apostles
of
satan
and
because
of
their
social
position
in
bourgeois
society
the
radicals
ignore
the
activity
of
the
anarchists
in
emma
goldman
participated
as
delegate
to
the
second
anarchist
congress
at
amsterdam
she
was
intensely
active
in
all
its
proceedings
and
supported
the
organization
of
the
anarchist
internationale
together
with
the
other
american
delegate
max
baginski
she
submitted
to
the
congress
an
exhaustive
report
of
american
conditions
closing
with
the
following
characteristic
remarks
the
charge
that
anarchism
is
destructive
rather
than
constructive
and
that
therefore
anarchism
is
opposed
to
organization
is
one
of
the
many
falsehoods
spread
by
our
opponents
they
confound
our
present
social
institutions
with
organization
hence
they
fail
to
understand
how
we
can
oppose
the
former
and
yet
favor
the
latter
the
fact
however
is
that
the
two
are
not
identical
the
state
is
commonly
regarded
as
the
highest
form
of
organization
but
is
it
in
reality
a
true
organization
is
it
not
rather
an
arbitrary
institution
cunningly
imposed
upon
the
masses
industry
too
is
called
an
organization
yet
nothing
is
farther
from
the
truth
industry
is
the
ceaseless
piracy
of
the
rich
against
the
poor
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
the
army
is
an
organization
but
a
close
investigation
will
show
that
it
is
nothing
else
than
a
cruel
instrument
of
blind
force
the
public
school
the
colleges
and
other
institutions
of
learning
are
they
not
models
of
organization
offering
the
people
fine
opportunities
for
instruction
far
from
it
the
school
more
than
any
other
institution
is
a
veritable
barrack
where
the
human
mind
is
drilled
and
manipulated
into
submission
to
various
social
and
moral
spooks
and
thus
fitted
to
continue
our
system
of
exploitation
and
oppression
organization
as
we
understand
it
however
is
a
different
thing
it
is
based
primarily
on
freedom
it
is
a
natural
and
voluntary
grouping
of
energies
to
secure
results
beneficial
to
humanity
it
is
the
harmony
of
organic
growth
which
produces
variety
of
color
and
form
the
complete
whole
we
admire
in
the
flower
analogously
will
the
organized
activity
of
free
human
beings
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
solidarity
result
in
the
perfection
of
social
harmony
which
we
call
anarchism
in
fact
anarchism
alone
makes
organization
of
common
interests
possible
since
it
abolishes
the
existing
antagonism
between
individuals
and
classes
under
present
conditions
the
antagonism
of
economic
and
social
interests
results
in
relentless
war
among
the
social
units
and
creates
an
insurmountable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
commonwealth
there
is
a
mistaken
notion
that
organization
does
not
foster
individual
freedom
that
on
the
contrary
it
means
the
decay
of
individuality
in
reality
however
the
true
function
of
organization
is
to
aid
the
development
and
growth
of
personality
just
as
the
animal
cells
by
mutual
express
their
latent
powers
in
formation
of
the
complete
organism
so
does
the
individual
by
effort
with
other
individuals
attain
his
highest
form
of
development
an
organization
in
the
true
sense
can
not
result
from
the
combination
of
mere
nonentities
it
must
be
composed
of
intelligent
individualities
indeed
the
total
of
the
possibilities
and
activities
of
an
organization
is
represented
in
the
expression
of
individual
energies
it
therefore
logically
follows
that
the
greater
the
number
of
strong
personalities
in
an
organization
the
less
danger
of
stagnation
and
the
more
intense
its
life
element
anarchism
asserts
the
possibility
of
an
organization
without
discipline
fear
or
punishment
and
without
the
pressure
of
poverty
a
new
social
organism
which
will
make
an
end
to
the
terrible
struggle
for
the
means
of
existence
the
savage
struggle
which
undermines
the
finest
qualities
in
man
and
ever
widens
the
social
abyss
in
short
anarchism
strives
towards
a
social
organization
which
will
establish
for
all
the
germ
of
such
an
organization
can
be
found
in
that
form
of
trades
unionism
which
has
done
away
with
centralization
bureaucracy
and
discipline
and
which
favors
independent
and
direct
action
on
the
part
of
its
members
the
very
considerable
progress
of
anarchist
ideas
in
america
can
best
be
gauged
by
the
remarkable
success
of
the
three
extensive
lecture
tours
of
emma
goldman
since
the
amsterdam
congress
of
each
tour
extended
over
new
territory
including
localities
where
anarchism
had
never
before
received
a
hearing
but
the
most
gratifying
aspect
of
her
untiring
efforts
is
the
tremendous
sale
of
anarchist
literature
whose
propagandist
effect
can
not
be
estimated
it
was
during
one
of
these
tours
that
a
remarkable
incident
happened
strikingly
demonstrating
the
inspiring
potentialities
of
the
anarchist
idea
in
san
francisco
in
emma
goldman
lecture
attracted
a
soldier
of
the
united
states
army
william
buwalda
for
daring
to
attend
an
anarchist
meeting
the
free
republic
buwalda
and
imprisoned
him
for
one
year
thanks
to
the
regenerating
power
of
the
new
philosophy
the
government
lost
a
soldier
but
the
cause
of
liberty
gained
a
man
a
propagandist
of
emma
goldman
importance
is
necessarily
a
sharp
thorn
to
the
reaction
she
is
looked
upon
as
a
danger
to
the
continued
existence
of
authoritarian
usurpation
no
wonder
then
that
the
enemy
resorts
to
any
and
all
means
to
make
her
impossible
a
systematic
attempt
to
suppress
her
activities
was
organized
a
year
ago
by
the
united
police
force
of
the
country
but
like
all
previous
similar
attempts
it
failed
in
a
most
brilliant
manner
energetic
protests
on
the
part
of
the
intellectual
element
of
america
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
dastardly
conspiracy
against
free
speech
another
attempt
to
make
emma
goldman
impossible
was
essayed
by
the
federal
authorities
at
washington
in
order
to
deprive
her
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
the
government
revoked
the
citizenship
papers
of
her
husband
whom
she
had
married
at
the
youthful
age
of
eighteen
and
whose
whereabouts
if
he
be
alive
could
not
be
determined
for
the
last
two
decades
the
great
government
of
the
glorious
united
states
did
not
hesitate
to
stoop
to
the
most
despicable
methods
to
accomplish
that
achievement
but
as
her
citizenship
had
never
proved
of
use
to
emma
goldman
she
can
bear
the
loss
with
a
light
heart
there
are
personalities
who
possess
such
a
powerful
individuality
that
by
its
very
force
they
exert
the
most
potent
influence
over
the
best
representatives
of
their
time
michael
bakunin
was
such
a
personality
but
for
him
richard
wagner
had
never
written
die
kunst
und
die
revolution
emma
goldman
is
a
similar
personality
she
is
a
strong
factor
in
the
life
of
america
by
virtue
of
her
eloquence
energy
and
brilliant
mentality
she
moulds
the
minds
and
hearts
of
thousands
of
her
auditors
deep
sympathy
and
compassion
for
suffering
humanity
and
an
inexorable
honesty
toward
herself
are
the
leading
traits
of
emma
goldman
no
person
whether
friend
or
foe
shall
presume
to
control
her
goal
or
dictate
her
mode
of
life
she
would
perish
rather
than
sacrifice
her
convictions
or
the
right
of
of
soul
and
body
respectability
could
easily
forgive
the
teaching
of
theoretic
anarchism
but
emma
goldman
does
not
merely
preach
the
new
philosophy
she
also
persists
in
living
it
and
that
is
the
one
supreme
unforgivable
crime
were
she
like
so
many
radicals
to
consider
her
ideal
as
merely
an
intellectual
ornament
were
she
to
make
concessions
to
existing
society
and
compromise
with
old
prejudices
then
even
the
most
radical
views
could
be
pardoned
in
her
but
that
she
takes
her
radicalism
seriously
that
it
has
permeated
her
blood
and
marrow
to
the
extent
where
she
not
merely
teaches
but
also
practices
her
convictions
this
shocks
even
the
radical
grundy
emma
goldman
lives
her
own
life
she
associates
with
publicans
hence
the
indignation
of
the
pharisees
and
sadducees
it
is
no
mere
coincidence
that
such
divergent
writers
as
pietro
gori
and
william
marion
reedy
find
similar
traits
in
their
characterization
of
emma
goldman
in
a
contribution
to
la
questione
sociale
pietro
gori
calls
her
a
moral
power
a
woman
who
with
the
vision
of
a
sibyl
prophesies
the
coming
of
a
new
kingdom
for
the
oppressed
a
woman
who
with
logic
and
deep
earnestness
analyses
the
ills
of
society
and
portrays
with
artist
touch
the
coming
dawn
of
humanity
founded
on
equality
brotherhood
and
liberty
william
reedy
sees
in
emma
goldman
the
daughter
of
the
dream
her
gospel
a
vision
which
is
the
vision
of
every
truly
man
and
woman
who
has
ever
lived
cowards
who
fear
the
consequences
of
their
deeds
have
coined
the
word
of
philosophic
anarchism
emma
goldman
is
too
sincere
too
defiant
to
seek
safety
behind
such
paltry
pleas
she
is
an
anarchist
pure
and
simple
she
represents
the
idea
of
anarchism
as
framed
by
josiah
warrn
proudhon
bakunin
kropotkin
tolstoy
yet
she
also
understands
the
psychologic
causes
which
induce
a
caserio
a
vaillant
a
bresci
a
berkman
or
a
czolgosz
to
commit
deeds
of
violence
to
the
soldier
in
the
social
struggle
it
is
a
point
of
honor
to
come
in
conflict
with
the
powers
of
darkness
and
tyranny
and
emma
goldman
is
proud
to
count
among
her
best
friends
and
comrades
men
and
women
who
bear
the
wounds
and
scars
received
in
battle
in
the
words
of
voltairine
de
cleyre
characterizing
emma
goldman
after
the
latter
imprisonment
in
the
spirit
that
animates
emma
goldman
is
the
only
one
which
will
emancipate
the
slave
from
his
slavery
the
tyrant
from
his
tyranny
the
spirit
which
is
willing
to
dare
and
suffer
hippolyte

new
york
december
preface
some
years
ago
i
heard
the
first
great
anarchist
speaker
the
inimitable
john
most
it
seemed
to
me
then
and
for
many
years
after
that
the
spoken
word
hurled
forth
among
the
masses
with
such
wonderful
eloquence
such
enthusiasm
and
fire
could
never
be
erased
from
the
human
mind
and
soul
how
could
any
one
of
all
the
multitudes
who
flocked
to
most
meetings
escape
his
prophetic
voice
surely
they
had
but
to
hear
him
to
throw
off
their
old
beliefs
and
see
the
truth
and
beauty
of
anarchism
my
one
great
longing
then
was
to
be
able
to
speak
with
the
tongue
of
john
most
that
i
too
might
thus
reach
the
masses
oh
for
the
naivety
of
youth
enthusiasm
it
is
the
time
when
the
hardest
thing
seems
but
child
play
it
is
the
only
period
in
life
worth
while
alas
this
period
is
but
of
short
duration
like
spring
the
sturm
und
drang
period
of
the
propagandist
brings
forth
growth
frail
and
delicate
to
be
matured
or
killed
according
to
its
powers
of
resistance
against
a
thousand
vicissitudes
my
great
faith
in
the
wonder
worker
the
spoken
word
is
no
more
i
have
realized
its
inadequacy
to
awaken
thought
or
even
emotion
gradually
and
with
no
small
struggle
against
this
realization
i
came
to
see
that
oral
propaganda
is
at
best
but
a
means
of
shaking
people
from
their
lethargy
it
leaves
no
lasting
impression
the
very
fact
that
most
people
attend
meetings
only
if
aroused
by
newspaper
sensations
or
because
they
expect
to
be
amused
is
proof
that
they
really
have
no
inner
urge
to
learn
it
is
altogether
different
with
the
written
mode
of
human
expression
no
one
unless
intensely
interested
in
progressive
ideas
will
bother
with
serious
books
that
leads
me
to
another
discovery
made
after
many
years
of
public
activity
it
is
this
all
claims
of
education
notwithstanding
the
pupil
will
accept
only
that
which
his
mind
craves
already
this
truth
is
recognized
by
most
modern
educators
in
relation
to
the
immature
mind
i
think
it
is
equally
true
regarding
the
adult
anarchists
or
revolutionists
can
no
more
be
made
than
musicians
all
that
can
be
done
is
to
plant
the
seeds
of
thought
whether
something
vital
will
develop
depends
largely
on
the
fertility
of
the
human
soil
though
the
quality
of
the
intellectual
seed
must
not
be
overlooked
in
meetings
the
audience
is
distracted
by
a
thousand
the
speaker
though
ever
so
eloquent
can
not
escape
the
restlessness
of
the
crowd
with
the
inevitable
result
that
he
will
fail
to
strike
root
in
all
probability
he
will
not
even
do
justice
to
himself
the
relation
between
the
writer
and
the
reader
is
more
intimate
true
books
are
only
what
we
want
them
to
be
rather
what
we
read
into
them
that
we
can
do
so
demonstrates
the
importance
of
written
as
against
oral
expression
it
is
this
certainty
which
has
induced
me
to
gather
in
one
volume
my
ideas
on
various
topics
of
individual
and
social
importance
they
represent
the
mental
and
soul
struggles
of
years
the
conclusions
derived
after
many
changes
and
inner
revisions
i
am
not
sanguine
enough
to
hope
that
my
readers
will
be
as
numerous
as
those
who
have
heard
me
but
i
prefer
to
reach
the
few
who
really
want
to
learn
rather
than
the
many
who
come
to
be
amused
as
to
the
book
it
must
speak
for
itself
explanatory
remarks
do
but
detract
from
the
ideas
set
forth
however
i
wish
to
forestall
two
objections
which
will
undoubtedly
be
raised
one
is
in
reference
to
the
essay
on
anarchism
the
other
on
minorities
versus
majorities
why
do
you
not
say
how
things
will
be
operated
under
anarchism
is
a
question
i
have
had
to
meet
thousands
of
times
because
i
believe
that
anarchism
can
not
consistently
impose
an
program
or
method
on
the
future
the
things
every
new
generation
has
to
fight
and
which
it
can
least
overcome
are
the
burdens
of
the
past
which
holds
us
all
as
in
a
net
anarchism
at
least
as
i
understand
it
leaves
posterity
free
to
develop
its
own
particular
systems
in
harmony
with
its
needs
our
most
vivid
imagination
can
not
foresee
the
potentialities
of
a
race
set
free
from
external
restraints
how
then
can
any
one
assume
to
map
out
a
line
of
conduct
for
those
to
come
we
who
pay
dearly
for
every
breath
of
pure
fresh
air
must
guard
against
the
tendency
to
fetter
the
future
if
we
succeed
in
clearing
the
soil
from
the
rubbish
of
the
past
and
present
we
will
leave
to
posterity
the
greatest
and
safest
heritage
of
all
ages
the
most
disheartening
tendency
common
among
readers
is
to
tear
out
one
sentence
from
a
work
as
a
criterion
of
the
writer
ideas
or
personality
friedrich
nietzsche
for
instance
is
decried
as
a
hater
of
the
weak
because
he
believed
in
the
uebermensch
it
does
not
occur
to
the
shallow
interpreters
of
that
giant
mind
that
this
vision
of
the
uebermensch
also
called
for
a
state
of
society
which
will
not
give
birth
to
a
race
of
weaklings
and
slaves
it
is
the
same
narrow
attitude
which
sees
in
max
stirner
naught
but
the
apostle
of
the
theory
each
for
himself
the
devil
take
the
hind
one
that
stirner
individualism
contains
the
greatest
social
possibilities
is
utterly
ignored
yet
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
if
society
is
ever
to
become
free
it
will
be
so
through
liberated
individuals
whose
free
efforts
make
society
these
examples
bring
me
to
the
objection
that
will
be
raised
to
minorities
versus
majorities
no
doubt
i
shall
be
excommunicated
as
an
enemy
of
the
people
because
i
repudiate
the
mass
as
a
creative
factor
i
shall
prefer
that
rather
than
be
guilty
of
the
demagogic
platitudes
so
commonly
in
vogue
as
a
bait
for
the
people
i
realize
the
malady
of
the
oppressed
and
disinherited
masses
only
too
well
but
i
refuse
to
prescribe
the
usual
ridiculous
palliatives
which
allow
the
patient
neither
to
die
nor
to
recover
one
can
not
be
too
extreme
in
dealing
with
social
ills
besides
the
extreme
thing
is
generally
the
true
thing
my
lack
of
faith
in
the
majority
is
dictated
by
my
faith
in
the
potentialities
of
the
individual
only
when
the
latter
becomes
free
to
choose
his
associates
for
a
common
purpose
can
we
hope
for
order
and
harmony
out
of
this
world
of
chaos
and
inequality
for
the
rest

book
must
speak

the
history
of
human
growth
and
development
is
at
the
same
time
the
history
of
the
terrible
struggle
of
every
new
idea
heralding
the
approach
of
a
brighter
dawn
in
its
tenacious
hold
on
tradition
the
old
has
never
hesitated
to
make
use
of
the
foulest
and
cruelest
means
to
stay
the
advent
of
the
new
in
whatever
form
or
period
the
latter
may
have
asserted
itself
nor
need
we
retrace
our
steps
into
the
distant
past
to
realize
the
enormity
of
opposition
difficulties
and
hardships
placed
in
the
path
of
every
progressive
idea
the
rack
the
thumbscrew
and
the
knout
are
still
with
us
so
are
the
garb
and
the
social
wrath
all
conspiring
against
the
spirit
that
is
serenely
marching
on
anarchism
could
not
hope
to
escape
the
fate
of
all
other
ideas
of
innovation
indeed
as
the
most
revolutionary
and
uncompromising
innovator
anarchism
must
needs
meet
with
the
combined
ignorance
and
venom
of
the
world
it
aims
to
reconstruct
to
deal
even
remotely
with
all
that
is
being
said
and
done
against
anarchism
would
necessitate
the
writing
of
a
whole
volume
i
shall
therefore
meet
only
two
of
the
principal
objections
in
so
doing
i
shall
attempt
to
elucidate
what
anarchism
really
stands
for
the
strange
phenomenon
of
the
opposition
to
anarchism
is
that
it
brings
to
light
the
relation
between
intelligence
and
ignorance
and
yet
this
is
not
so
very
strange
when
we
consider
the
relativity
of
all
things
the
ignorant
mass
has
in
its
favor
that
it
makes
no
pretense
of
knowledge
or
tolerance
acting
as
it
always
does
by
mere
impulse
its
reasons
are
like
those
of
a
child
why
because
yet
the
opposition
of
the
uneducated
to
anarchism
deserves
the
same
consideration
as
that
of
the
intelligent
man
what
then
are
the
objections
first
anarchism
is
impractical
though
a
beautiful
ideal
second
anarchism
stands
for
violence
and
destruction
hence
it
must
be
repudiated
as
vile
and
dangerous
both
the
intelligent
man
and
the
ignorant
mass
judge
not
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
subject
but
either
from
hearsay
or
false
interpretation
a
practical
scheme
says
oscar
wilde
is
either
one
already
in
existence
or
a
scheme
that
could
be
carried
out
under
the
existing
conditions
but
it
is
exactly
the
existing
conditions
that
one
objects
to
and
any
scheme
that
could
accept
these
conditions
is
wrong
and
foolish
the
true
criterion
of
the
practical
therefore
is
not
whether
the
latter
can
keep
intact
the
wrong
or
foolish
rather
is
it
whether
the
scheme
has
vitality
enough
to
leave
the
stagnant
waters
of
the
old
and
build
as
well
as
sustain
new
life
in
the
light
of
this
conception
anarchism
is
indeed
practical
more
than
any
other
idea
it
is
helping
to
do
away
with
the
wrong
and
foolish
more
than
any
other
idea
it
is
building
and
sustaining
new
life
the
emotions
of
the
ignorant
man
are
continuously
kept
at
a
pitch
by
the
most
stories
about
anarchism
not
a
thing
too
outrageous
to
be
employed
against
this
philosophy
and
its
exponents
therefore
anarchism
represents
to
the
unthinking
what
the
proverbial
bad
man
does
to
the
child
a
black
monster
bent
on
swallowing
everything
in
short
destruction
and
violence
destruction
and
violence
how
is
the
ordinary
man
to
know
that
the
most
violent
element
in
society
is
ignorance
that
its
power
of
destruction
is
the
very
thing
anarchism
is
combating
nor
is
he
aware
that
anarchism
whose
roots
as
it
were
are
part
of
forces
destroys
not
healthful
tissue
but
parasitic
growths
that
feed
on
the
life
essence
of
society
it
is
merely
clearing
the
soil
from
weeds
and
sagebrush
that
it
may
eventually
bear
healthy
fruit
someone
has
said
that
it
requires
less
mental
effort
to
condemn
than
to
think
the
widespread
mental
indolence
so
prevalent
in
society
proves
this
to
be
only
too
true
rather
than
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
any
given
idea
to
examine
into
its
origin
and
meaning
most
people
will
either
condemn
it
altogether
or
rely
on
some
superficial
or
prejudicial
definition
of
anarchism
urges
man
to
think
to
investigate
to
analyze
every
proposition
but
that
the
brain
capacity
of
the
average
reader
be
not
taxed
too
much
i
also
shall
begin
with
a
definition
and
then
elaborate
on
the
latter
anarchism
the
philosophy
of
a
new
social
order
based
on
liberty
unrestricted
by
law
the
theory
that
all
forms
of
government
rest
on
violence
and
are
therefore
wrong
and
harmful
as
well
as
unnecessary
the
new
social
order
rests
of
course
on
the
materialistic
basis
of
life
but
while
all
anarchists
agree
that
the
main
evil
today
is
an
economic
one
they
maintain
that
the
solution
of
that
evil
can
be
brought
about
only
through
the
consideration
of
every
phase
of
life
individual
as
well
as
the
collective
the
internal
as
well
as
the
external
phases
a
thorough
perusal
of
the
history
of
human
development
will
disclose
two
elements
in
bitter
conflict
with
each
other
elements
that
are
only
now
beginning
to
be
understood
not
as
foreign
to
each
other
but
as
closely
related
and
truly
harmonious
if
only
placed
in
proper
environment
the
individual
and
social
instincts
the
individual
and
society
have
waged
a
relentless
and
bloody
battle
for
ages
each
striving
for
supremacy
because
each
was
blind
to
the
value
and
importance
of
the
other
the
individual
and
social
instincts
the
one
a
most
potent
factor
for
individual
endeavor
for
growth
aspiration
the
other
an
equally
potent
factor
for
mutual
helpfulness
and
social
the
explanation
of
the
storm
raging
within
the
individual
and
between
him
and
his
surroundings
is
not
far
to
seek
the
primitive
man
unable
to
understand
his
being
much
less
the
unity
of
all
life
felt
himself
absolutely
dependent
on
blind
hidden
forces
ever
ready
to
mock
and
taunt
him
out
of
that
attitude
grew
the
religious
concepts
of
man
as
a
mere
speck
of
dust
dependent
on
superior
powers
on
high
who
can
only
be
appeased
by
complete
surrender
all
the
early
sagas
rest
on
that
idea
which
continues
to
be
the
of
the
biblical
tales
dealing
with
the
relation
of
man
to
god
to
the
state
to
society
again
and
again
the
same
motif
man
is
nothing
the
powers
are
everything
thus
jehovah
would
only
endure
man
on
condition
of
complete
surrender
man
can
have
all
the
glories
of
the
earth
but
he
must
not
become
conscious
of
himself
the
state
society
and
moral
laws
all
sing
the
same
refrain
man
can
have
all
the
glories
of
the
earth
but
he
must
not
become
conscious
of
himself
anarchism
is
the
only
philosophy
which
brings
to
man
the
consciousness
of
himself
which
maintains
that
god
the
state
and
society
are
that
their
promises
are
null
and
void
since
they
can
be
fulfilled
only
through
man
subordination
anarchism
is
therefore
the
teacher
of
the
unity
of
life
not
merely
in
nature
but
in
man
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
individual
and
the
social
instincts
any
more
than
there
is
between
the
heart
and
the
lungs
the
one
the
receptacle
of
a
precious
life
essence
the
other
the
repository
of
the
element
that
keeps
the
essence
pure
and
strong
the
individual
is
the
heart
of
society
conserving
the
essence
of
social
life
society
is
the
lungs
which
are
distributing
the
element
to
keep
the
life
essence
that
is
the
individual
pure
and
strong
the
one
thing
of
value
in
the
world
says
emerson
is
the
active
soul
this
every
man
contains
within
him
the
soul
active
sees
absolute
truth
and
utters
truth
and
creates
in
other
words
the
individual
instinct
is
the
thing
of
value
in
the
world
it
is
the
true
soul
that
sees
and
creates
the
truth
alive
out
of
which
is
to
come
a
still
greater
truth
the
social
soul
anarchism
is
the
great
liberator
of
man
from
the
phantoms
that
have
held
him
captive
it
is
the
arbiter
and
pacifier
of
the
two
forces
for
individual
and
social
harmony
to
accomplish
that
unity
anarchism
has
declared
war
on
the
pernicious
influences
which
have
so
far
prevented
the
harmonious
blending
of
individual
and
social
instincts
the
individual
and
society
religion
the
dominion
of
the
human
mind
property
the
dominion
of
human
needs
and
government
the
dominion
of
human
conduct
represent
the
stronghold
of
man
enslavement
and
all
the
horrors
it
entails
religion
how
it
dominates
man
mind
how
it
humiliates
and
degrades
his
soul
god
is
everything
man
is
nothing
says
religion
but
out
of
that
nothing
god
has
created
a
kingdom
so
despotic
so
tyrannical
so
cruel
so
terribly
exacting
that
naught
but
gloom
and
tears
and
blood
have
ruled
the
world
since
gods
began
anarchism
rouses
man
to
rebellion
against
this
black
monster
break
your
mental
fetters
says
anarchism
to
man
for
not
until
you
think
and
judge
for
yourself
will
you
get
rid
of
the
dominion
of
darkness
the
greatest
obstacle
to
all
progress
property
the
dominion
of
man
needs
the
denial
of
the
right
to
satisfy
his
needs
time
was
when
property
claimed
a
divine
right
when
it
came
to
man
with
the
same
refrain
even
as
religion
sacrifice
abnegate
submit
the
spirit
of
anarchism
has
lifted
man
from
his
prostrate
position
he
now
stands
erect
with
his
face
toward
the
light
he
has
learned
to
see
the
insatiable
devouring
devastating
nature
of
property
and
he
is
preparing
to
strike
the
monster
dead
property
is
robbery
said
the
great
french
anarchist
proudhon
yes
but
without
risk
and
danger
to
the
robber
monopolizing
the
accumulated
efforts
of
man
property
has
robbed
him
of
his
birthright
and
has
turned
him
loose
a
pauper
and
an
outcast
property
has
not
even
the
excuse
that
man
does
not
create
enough
to
satisfy
all
needs
the
a
b
c
student
of
economics
knows
that
the
productivity
of
labor
within
the
last
few
decades
far
exceeds
normal
demand
a
hundredfold
but
what
are
normal
demands
to
an
abnormal
institution
the
only
demand
that
property
recognizes
is
its
own
gluttonous
appetite
for
greater
wealth
because
wealth
means
power
the
power
to
subdue
to
crush
to
exploit
the
power
to
enslave
to
outrage
to
degrade
america
is
particularly
boastful
of
her
great
power
her
enormous
national
wealth
poor
america
of
what
avail
is
all
her
wealth
if
the
individuals
comprising
the
nation
are
wretchedly
poor
if
they
live
in
squalor
in
filth
in
crime
with
hope
and
joy
gone
a
homeless
soilless
army
of
human
prey
it
is
generally
conceded
that
unless
the
returns
of
any
business
venture
exceed
the
cost
bankruptcy
is
inevitable
but
those
engaged
in
the
business
of
producing
wealth
have
not
yet
learned
even
this
simple
lesson
every
year
the
cost
of
production
in
human
life
is
growing
larger
killed
wounded
in
america
last
year
the
returns
to
the
masses
who
help
to
create
wealth
are
ever
getting
smaller
yet
america
continues
to
be
blind
to
the
inevitable
bankruptcy
of
our
business
of
production
nor
is
this
the
only
crime
of
the
latter
still
more
fatal
is
the
crime
of
turning
the
producer
into
a
mere
particle
of
a
machine
with
less
will
and
decision
than
his
master
of
steel
and
iron
man
is
being
robbed
not
merely
of
the
products
of
his
labor
but
of
the
power
of
free
initiative
of
originality
and
the
interest
in
or
desire
for
the
things
he
is
making
real
wealth
consists
in
things
of
utility
and
beauty
in
things
that
help
to
create
strong
beautiful
bodies
and
surroundings
inspiring
to
live
in
but
if
man
is
doomed
to
wind
cotton
around
a
spool
or
dig
coal
or
build
roads
for
thirty
years
of
his
life
there
can
be
no
talk
of
wealth
what
he
gives
to
the
world
is
only
gray
and
hideous
things
reflecting
a
dull
and
hideous
existence
too
weak
to
live
too
cowardly
to
die
strange
to
say
there
are
people
who
extol
this
deadening
method
of
centralized
production
as
the
proudest
achievement
of
our
age
they
fail
utterly
to
realize
that
if
we
are
to
continue
in
machine
subserviency
our
slavery
is
more
complete
than
was
our
bondage
to
the
king
they
do
not
want
to
know
that
centralization
is
not
only
the
of
liberty
but
also
of
health
and
beauty
of
art
and
science
all
these
being
impossible
in
a
mechanical
atmosphere
anarchism
can
not
but
repudiate
such
a
method
of
production
its
goal
is
the
freest
possible
expression
of
all
the
latent
powers
of
the
individual
oscar
wilde
defines
a
perfect
personality
as
one
who
develops
under
perfect
conditions
who
is
not
wounded
maimed
or
in
danger
a
perfect
personality
then
is
only
possible
in
a
state
of
society
where
man
is
free
to
choose
the
mode
of
work
the
conditions
of
work
and
the
freedom
to
work
one
to
whom
the
making
of
a
table
the
building
of
a
house
or
the
tilling
of
the
soil
is
what
the
painting
is
to
the
artist
and
the
discovery
to
the
scientist
the
result
of
inspiration
of
intense
longing
and
deep
interest
in
work
as
a
creative
force
that
being
the
ideal
of
anarchism
its
economic
arrangements
must
consist
of
voluntary
productive
and
distributive
associations
gradually
developing
into
free
communism
as
the
best
means
of
producing
with
the
least
waste
of
human
energy
anarchism
however
also
recognizes
the
right
of
the
individual
or
numbers
of
individuals
to
arrange
at
all
times
for
other
forms
of
work
in
harmony
with
their
tastes
and
desires
such
free
display
of
human
energy
being
possible
only
under
complete
individual
and
social
freedom
anarchism
directs
its
forces
against
the
third
and
greatest
foe
of
all
social
equality
namely
the
state
organized
authority
or
statutory
law
the
dominion
of
human
conduct
just
as
religion
has
fettered
the
human
mind
and
as
property
or
the
monopoly
of
things
has
subdued
and
stifled
man
needs
so
has
the
state
enslaved
his
spirit
dictating
every
phase
of
conduct
all
government
in
essence
says
emerson
is
tyranny
it
matters
not
whether
it
is
government
by
divine
right
or
majority
rule
in
every
instance
its
aim
is
the
absolute
subordination
of
the
individual
referring
to
the
american
government
the
greatest
american
anarchist
david
thoreau
said
government
what
is
it
but
a
tradition
though
a
recent
one
endeavoring
to
transmit
itself
unimpaired
to
posterity
but
each
instance
losing
its
integrity
it
has
not
the
vitality
and
force
of
a
single
living
man
law
never
made
man
a
whit
more
just
and
by
means
of
their
respect
for
it
even
the
well
disposed
are
daily
made
agents
of
injustice
indeed
the
keynote
of
government
is
injustice
with
the
arrogance
and
of
the
king
who
could
do
no
wrong
governments
ordain
judge
condemn
and
punish
the
most
insignificant
offenses
while
maintaining
themselves
by
the
greatest
of
all
offenses
the
annihilation
of
individual
liberty
thus
ouida
is
right
when
she
maintains
that
the
state
only
aims
at
instilling
those
qualities
in
its
public
by
which
its
demands
are
obeyed
and
its
exchequer
is
filled
its
highest
attainment
is
the
reduction
of
mankind
to
clockwork
in
its
atmosphere
all
those
finer
and
more
delicate
liberties
which
require
treatment
and
spacious
expansion
inevitably
dry
up
and
perish
the
state
requires
a
taxpaying
machine
in
which
there
is
no
hitch
an
exchequer
in
which
there
is
never
a
deficit
and
a
public
monotonous
obedient
colorless
spiritless
moving
humbly
like
a
flock
of
sheep
along
a
straight
high
road
between
two
walls
yet
even
a
flock
of
sheep
would
resist
the
chicanery
of
the
state
if
it
were
not
for
the
corruptive
tyrannical
and
oppressive
methods
it
employs
to
serve
its
purposes
therefore
bakunin
repudiates
the
state
as
synonymous
with
the
surrender
of
the
liberty
of
the
individual
or
small
minorities
the
destruction
of
social
relationship
the
curtailment
or
complete
denial
even
of
life
itself
for
its
own
aggrandizement
the
state
is
the
altar
of
political
freedom
and
like
the
religious
altar
it
is
maintained
for
the
purpose
of
human
sacrifice
in
fact
there
is
hardly
a
modern
thinker
who
does
not
agree
that
government
organized
authority
or
the
state
is
necessary
only
to
maintain
or
protect
property
and
monopoly
it
has
proven
efficient
in
that
function
only
even
george
bernard
shaw
who
hopes
for
the
miraculous
from
the
state
under
fabianism
nevertheless
admits
that
it
is
at
present
a
huge
machine
for
robbing
and
of
the
poor
by
brute
force
this
being
the
case
it
is
hard
to
see
why
the
clever
prefacer
wishes
to
uphold
the
state
after
poverty
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
unfortunately
there
are
still
a
number
of
people
who
continue
in
the
fatal
belief
that
government
rests
on
natural
laws
that
it
maintains
social
order
and
harmony
that
it
diminishes
crime
and
that
it
prevents
the
lazy
man
from
fleecing
his
fellows
i
shall
therefore
examine
these
contentions
a
natural
law
is
that
factor
in
man
which
asserts
itself
freely
and
spontaneously
without
any
external
force
in
harmony
with
the
requirements
of
nature
for
instance
the
demand
for
nutrition
for
sex
gratification
for
light
air
and
exercise
is
a
natural
law
but
its
expression
needs
not
the
machinery
of
government
needs
not
the
club
the
gun
the
handcuff
or
the
prison
to
obey
such
laws
if
we
may
call
it
obedience
requires
only
spontaneity
and
free
opportunity
that
governments
do
not
maintain
themselves
through
such
harmonious
factors
is
proven
by
the
terrible
array
of
violence
force
and
coercion
all
governments
use
in
order
to
live
thus
blackstone
is
right
when
he
says
human
laws
are
invalid
because
they
are
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
unless
it
be
the
order
of
warsaw
after
the
slaughter
of
thousands
of
people
it
is
difficult
to
ascribe
to
governments
any
capacity
for
order
or
social
harmony
order
derived
through
submission
and
maintained
by
terror
is
not
much
of
a
safe
guaranty
yet
that
is
the
only
order
that
governments
have
ever
maintained
true
social
harmony
grows
naturally
out
of
solidarity
of
interests
in
a
society
where
those
who
always
work
never
have
anything
while
those
who
never
work
enjoy
everything
solidarity
of
interests
is
hence
social
harmony
is
but
a
myth
the
only
way
organized
authority
meets
this
grave
situation
is
by
extending
still
greater
privileges
to
those
who
have
already
monopolized
the
earth
and
by
still
further
enslaving
the
disinherited
masses
thus
the
entire
arsenal
of
government
laws
police
soldiers
the
courts
legislatures
prisons
is
strenuously
engaged
in
harmonizing
the
most
antagonistic
elements
in
society
the
most
absurd
apology
for
authority
and
law
is
that
they
serve
to
diminish
crime
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
state
is
itself
the
greatest
criminal
breaking
every
written
and
natural
law
stealing
in
the
form
of
taxes
killing
in
the
form
of
war
and
capital
punishment
it
has
come
to
an
absolute
standstill
in
coping
with
crime
it
has
failed
utterly
to
destroy
or
even
minimize
the
horrible
scourge
of
its
own
creation
crime
is
naught
but
misdirected
energy
so
long
as
every
institution
of
today
economic
political
social
and
moral
conspires
to
misdirect
human
energy
into
wrong
channels
so
long
as
most
people
are
out
of
place
doing
the
things
they
hate
to
do
living
a
life
they
loathe
to
live
crime
will
be
inevitable
and
all
the
laws
on
the
statutes
can
only
increase
but
never
do
away
with
crime
what
does
society
as
it
exists
today
know
of
the
process
of
despair
the
poverty
the
horrors
the
fearful
struggle
the
human
soul
must
pass
on
its
way
to
crime
and
degradation
who
that
knows
this
terrible
process
can
fail
to
see
the
truth
in
these
words
of
peter
kropotkin
those
who
will
hold
the
balance
between
the
benefits
thus
attributed
to
law
and
punishment
and
the
degrading
effect
of
the
latter
on
humanity
those
who
will
estimate
the
torrent
of
depravity
poured
abroad
in
human
society
by
the
informer
favored
by
the
judge
even
and
paid
for
in
clinking
cash
by
governments
under
the
pretext
of
aiding
to
unmask
crime
those
who
will
go
within
prison
walls
and
there
see
what
human
beings
become
when
deprived
of
liberty
when
subjected
to
the
care
of
brutal
keepers
to
coarse
cruel
words
to
a
thousand
stinging
piercing
humiliations
will
agree
with
us
that
the
entire
apparatus
of
prison
and
punishment
is
an
abomination
which
ought
to
be
brought
to
an
end
the
deterrent
influence
of
law
on
the
lazy
man
is
too
absurd
to
merit
consideration
if
society
were
only
relieved
of
the
waste
and
expense
of
keeping
a
lazy
class
and
the
equally
great
expense
of
the
paraphernalia
of
protection
this
lazy
class
requires
the
social
tables
would
contain
an
abundance
for
all
including
even
the
occasional
lazy
individual
besides
it
is
well
to
consider
that
laziness
results
either
from
special
privileges
or
physical
and
mental
abnormalities
our
present
insane
system
of
production
fosters
both
and
the
most
astounding
phenomenon
is
that
people
should
want
to
work
at
all
now
anarchism
aims
to
strip
labor
of
its
deadening
dulling
aspect
of
its
gloom
and
compulsion
it
aims
to
make
work
an
instrument
of
joy
of
strength
of
color
of
real
harmony
so
that
the
poorest
sort
of
a
man
should
find
in
work
both
recreation
and
hope
to
achieve
such
an
arrangement
of
life
government
with
its
unjust
arbitrary
repressive
measures
must
be
done
away
with
at
best
it
has
but
imposed
one
single
mode
of
life
upon
all
without
regard
to
individual
and
social
variations
and
needs
in
destroying
government
and
statutory
laws
anarchism
proposes
to
rescue
the
and
independence
of
the
individual
from
all
restraint
and
invasion
by
authority
only
in
freedom
can
man
grow
to
his
full
stature
only
in
freedom
will
he
learn
to
think
and
move
and
give
the
very
best
in
him
only
in
freedom
will
he
realize
the
true
force
of
the
social
bonds
which
knit
men
together
and
which
are
the
true
foundation
of
a
normal
social
life
but
what
about
human
nature
can
it
be
changed
and
if
not
will
it
endure
under
anarchism
poor
human
nature
what
horrible
crimes
have
been
committed
in
thy
name
every
fool
from
king
to
policeman
from
the
flatheaded
parson
to
the
visionless
dabbler
in
science
presumes
to
speak
authoritatively
of
human
nature
the
greater
the
mental
charlatan
the
more
definite
his
insistence
on
the
wickedness
and
weaknesses
of
human
nature
yet
how
can
any
one
speak
of
it
today
with
every
soul
in
a
prison
with
every
heart
fettered
wounded
and
maimed
john
burroughs
has
stated
that
experimental
study
of
animals
in
captivity
is
absolutely
useless
their
character
their
habits
their
appetites
undergo
a
complete
transformation
when
torn
from
their
soil
in
field
and
forest
with
human
nature
caged
in
a
narrow
space
whipped
daily
into
submission
how
can
we
speak
of
its
potentialities
freedom
expansion
opportunity
and
above
all
peace
and
repose
alone
can
teach
us
the
real
dominant
factors
of
human
nature
and
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
anarchism
then
really
stands
for
the
liberation
of
the
human
mind
from
the
dominion
of
religion
the
liberation
of
the
human
body
from
the
dominion
of
property
liberation
from
the
shackles
and
restraint
of
government
anarchism
stands
for
a
social
order
based
on
the
free
grouping
of
individuals
for
the
purpose
of
producing
real
social
wealth
an
order
that
will
guarantee
to
every
human
being
free
access
to
the
earth
and
full
enjoyment
of
the
necessities
of
life
according
to
individual
desires
tastes
and
inclinations
this
is
not
a
wild
fancy
or
an
aberration
of
the
mind
it
is
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
hosts
of
intellectual
men
and
women
the
world
over
a
conclusion
resulting
from
the
close
and
studious
observation
of
the
tendencies
of
modern
society
individual
liberty
and
economic
equality
the
twin
forces
for
the
birth
of
what
is
fine
and
true
in
man
as
to
methods
anarchism
is
not
as
some
may
suppose
a
theory
of
the
future
to
be
realized
through
divine
inspiration
it
is
a
living
force
in
the
affairs
of
our
life
constantly
creating
new
conditions
the
methods
of
anarchism
therefore
do
not
comprise
an
program
to
be
carried
out
under
all
circumstances
methods
must
grow
out
of
the
economic
needs
of
each
place
and
clime
and
of
the
intellectual
and
temperamental
requirements
of
the
individual
the
serene
calm
character
of
a
tolstoy
will
wish
different
methods
for
social
reconstruction
than
the
intense
overflowing
personality
of
a
michael
bakunin
or
a
peter
kropotkin
equally
so
it
must
be
apparent
that
the
economic
and
political
needs
of
russia
will
dictate
more
drastic
measures
than
would
england
or
america
anarchism
does
not
stand
for
military
drill
and
uniformity
it
does
however
stand
for
the
spirit
of
revolt
in
whatever
form
against
everything
that
hinders
human
growth
all
anarchists
agree
in
that
as
they
also
agree
in
their
opposition
to
the
political
machinery
as
a
means
of
bringing
about
the
great
social
change
all
voting
says
thoreau
is
a
sort
of
gaming
like
checkers
or
backgammon
a
playing
with
right
and
wrong
its
obligation
never
exceeds
that
of
expediency
even
voting
for
the
right
thing
is
doing
nothing
for
it
a
wise
man
will
not
leave
the
right
to
the
mercy
of
chance
nor
wish
it
to
prevail
through
the
power
of
the
majority
a
close
examination
of
the
machinery
of
politics
and
its
achievements
will
bear
out
the
logic
of
thoreau
what
does
the
history
of
parliamentarism
show
nothing
but
failure
and
defeat
not
even
a
single
reform
to
ameliorate
the
economic
and
social
stress
of
the
people
laws
have
been
passed
and
enactments
made
for
the
improvement
and
protection
of
labor
thus
it
was
proven
only
last
year
that
illinois
with
the
most
rigid
laws
for
mine
protection
had
the
greatest
mine
disasters
in
states
where
child
labor
laws
prevail
child
exploitation
is
at
its
highest
and
though
with
us
the
workers
enjoy
full
political
opportunities
capitalism
has
reached
the
most
brazen
zenith
even
were
the
workers
able
to
have
their
own
representatives
for
which
our
good
socialist
politicians
are
clamoring
what
chances
are
there
for
their
honesty
and
good
faith
one
has
but
to
bear
in
mind
the
process
of
politics
to
realize
that
its
path
of
good
intentions
is
full
of
pitfalls
intriguing
flattering
lying
cheating
in
fact
chicanery
of
every
description
whereby
the
political
aspirant
can
achieve
success
added
to
that
is
a
complete
demoralization
of
character
and
conviction
until
nothing
is
left
that
would
make
one
hope
for
anything
from
such
a
human
derelict
time
and
time
again
the
people
were
foolish
enough
to
trust
believe
and
support
with
their
last
farthing
aspiring
politicians
only
to
find
themselves
betrayed
and
cheated
it
may
be
claimed
that
men
of
integrity
would
not
become
corrupt
in
the
political
grinding
mill
perhaps
not
but
such
men
would
be
absolutely
helpless
to
exert
the
slightest
influence
in
behalf
of
labor
as
indeed
has
been
shown
in
numerous
instances
the
state
is
the
economic
master
of
its
servants
good
men
if
such
there
be
would
either
remain
true
to
their
political
faith
and
lose
their
economic
support
or
they
would
cling
to
their
economic
master
and
be
utterly
unable
to
do
the
slightest
good
the
political
arena
leaves
one
no
alternative
one
must
either
be
a
dunce
or
a
rogue
the
political
superstition
is
still
holding
sway
over
the
hearts
and
minds
of
the
masses
but
the
true
lovers
of
liberty
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
instead
they
believe
with
stirner
that
man
has
as
much
liberty
as
he
is
willing
to
take
anarchism
therefore
stands
for
direct
action
the
open
defiance
of
and
resistance
to
all
laws
and
restrictions
economic
social
and
moral
but
defiance
and
resistance
are
illegal
therein
lies
the
salvation
of
man
everything
illegal
necessitates
integrity
and
courage
in
short
it
calls
for
free
independent
spirits
for
men
who
are
men
and
who
have
a
bone
in
their
backs
which
you
can
not
pass
your
hand
through
universal
suffrage
itself
owes
its
existence
to
direct
action
if
not
for
the
spirit
of
rebellion
of
the
defiance
on
the
part
of
the
american
revolutionary
fathers
their
posterity
would
still
wear
the
king
coat
if
not
for
the
direct
action
of
a
john
brown
and
his
comrades
america
would
still
trade
in
the
flesh
of
the
black
man
true
the
trade
in
white
flesh
is
still
going
on
but
that
too
will
have
to
be
abolished
by
direct
action
the
economic
arena
of
the
modern
gladiator
owes
its
existence
to
direct
action
it
is
but
recently
that
law
and
government
have
attempted
to
crush
the
movement
and
condemned
the
exponents
of
man
right
to
organize
to
prison
as
conspirators
had
they
sought
to
assert
their
cause
through
begging
pleading
and
compromise
would
today
be
a
negligible
quantity
in
france
in
spain
in
italy
in
russia
nay
even
in
england
witness
the
growing
rebellion
of
english
labor
unions
direct
revolutionary
economic
action
has
become
so
strong
a
force
in
the
battle
for
industrial
liberty
as
to
make
the
world
realize
the
tremendous
importance
of
labor
power
the
general
strike
the
supreme
expression
of
the
economic
consciousness
of
the
workers
was
ridiculed
in
america
but
a
short
time
ago
today
every
great
strike
in
order
to
win
must
realize
the
importance
of
the
solidaric
general
protest
direct
action
having
proven
effective
along
economic
lines
is
equally
potent
in
the
environment
of
the
individual
there
a
hundred
forces
encroach
upon
his
being
and
only
persistent
resistance
to
them
will
finally
set
him
free
direct
action
against
the
authority
in
the
shop
direct
action
against
the
authority
of
the
law
direct
action
against
the
invasive
meddlesome
authority
of
our
moral
code
is
the
logical
consistent
method
of
anarchism
will
it
not
lead
to
a
revolution
indeed
it
will
no
real
social
change
has
ever
come
about
without
a
revolution
people
are
either
not
familiar
with
their
history
or
they
have
not
yet
learned
that
revolution
is
but
thought
carried
into
action
anarchism
the
great
leaven
of
thought
is
today
permeating
every
phase
of
human
endeavor
science
art
literature
the
drama
the
effort
for
economic
betterment
in
fact
every
individual
and
social
opposition
to
the
existing
disorder
of
things
is
illumined
by
the
spiritual
light
of
anarchism
it
is
the
philosophy
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
it
is
the
theory
of
social
harmony
it
is
the
great
surging
living
truth
that
is
reconstructing
the
world
and
that
will
usher
in
the
dawn
minorities
versus
majorities
if
i
were
to
give
a
summary
of
the
tendency
of
our
times
i
would
say
quantity
the
multitude
the
mass
spirit
dominates
everywhere
destroying
quality
our
entire
life
production
politics
and
education
rests
on
quantity
on
numbers
the
worker
who
once
took
pride
in
the
thoroughness
and
quality
of
his
work
has
been
replaced
by
brainless
incompetent
automatons
who
turn
out
enormous
quantities
of
things
valueless
to
themselves
and
generally
injurious
to
the
rest
of
mankind
thus
quantity
instead
of
adding
to
life
comforts
and
peace
has
merely
increased
man
burden
in
politics
naught
but
quantity
counts
in
proportion
to
its
increase
however
principles
ideals
justice
and
uprightness
are
completely
swamped
by
the
array
of
numbers
in
the
struggle
for
supremacy
the
various
political
parties
outdo
each
other
in
trickery
deceit
cunning
and
shady
machinations
confident
that
the
one
who
succeeds
is
sure
to
be
hailed
by
the
majority
as
the
victor
that
is
the
only
god
success
as
to
what
expense
what
terrible
cost
to
character
is
of
no
moment
we
have
not
far
to
go
in
search
of
proof
to
verify
this
sad
fact
never
before
did
the
corruption
the
complete
rottenness
of
our
government
stand
so
thoroughly
exposed
never
before
were
the
american
people
brought
face
to
face
with
the
judas
nature
of
that
political
body
which
has
claimed
for
years
to
be
absolutely
beyond
reproach
as
the
mainstay
of
our
institutions
the
true
protector
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people
yet
when
the
crimes
of
that
party
became
so
brazen
that
even
the
blind
could
see
them
it
needed
but
to
muster
up
its
minions
and
its
supremacy
was
assured
thus
the
very
victims
duped
betrayed
outraged
a
hundred
times
decided
not
against
but
in
favor
of
the
victor
bewildered
the
few
asked
how
could
the
majority
betray
the
traditions
of
american
liberty
where
was
its
judgment
its
reasoning
capacity
that
is
just
it
the
majority
can
not
reason
it
has
no
judgment
lacking
utterly
in
originality
and
moral
courage
the
majority
has
always
placed
its
destiny
in
the
hands
of
others
incapable
of
standing
responsibilities
it
has
followed
its
leaders
even
unto
destruction
stockman
was
right
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
truth
and
justice
in
our
midst
are
the
compact
majorities
the
damned
compact
majority
without
ambition
or
initiative
the
compact
mass
hates
nothing
so
much
as
innovation
it
has
always
opposed
condemned
and
hounded
the
innovator
the
pioneer
of
a
new
truth
the
oft
repeated
slogan
of
our
time
is
among
all
politicians
the
socialists
included
that
ours
is
an
era
of
individualism
of
the
minority
only
those
who
do
not
probe
beneath
the
surface
might
be
led
to
entertain
this
view
have
not
the
few
accumulated
the
wealth
of
the
world
are
they
not
the
masters
the
absolute
kings
of
the
situation
their
success
however
is
due
not
to
individualism
but
to
the
inertia
the
cravenness
the
utter
submission
of
the
mass
the
latter
wants
but
to
be
dominated
to
be
led
to
be
coerced
as
to
individualism
at
no
time
in
human
history
did
it
have
less
chance
of
expression
less
opportunity
to
assert
itself
in
a
normal
healthy
manner
the
individual
educator
imbued
with
honesty
of
purpose
the
artist
or
writer
of
original
ideas
the
independent
scientist
or
explorer
the
pioneers
of
social
changes
are
daily
pushed
to
the
wall
by
men
whose
learning
and
creative
ability
have
become
decrepit
with
age
educators
of
ferrer
type
are
nowhere
tolerated
while
the
dietitians
of
predigested
food
a
la
professors
eliot
and
butler
are
the
successful
perpetuators
of
an
age
of
nonentities
of
automatons
in
the
literary
and
dramatic
world
the
humphrey
wards
and
clyde
fitches
are
the
idols
of
the
mass
while
but
few
know
or
appreciate
the
beauty
and
genius
of
an
emerson
thoreau
whitman
an
ibsen
a
hauptmann
a
butler
yeats
or
a
stephen
phillips
they
are
like
solitary
stars
far
beyond
the
horizon
of
the
multitude
publishers
theatrical
managers
and
critics
ask
not
for
the
quality
inherent
in
creative
art
but
will
it
meet
with
a
good
sale
will
it
suit
the
palate
of
the
people
alas
this
palate
is
like
a
dumping
ground
it
relishes
anything
that
needs
no
mental
mastication
as
a
result
the
mediocre
the
ordinary
the
commonplace
represents
the
chief
literary
output
need
i
say
that
in
art
we
are
confronted
with
the
same
sad
facts
one
has
but
to
inspect
our
parks
and
thoroughfares
to
realize
the
hideousness
and
vulgarity
of
the
art
manufacture
certainly
none
but
a
majority
taste
would
tolerate
such
an
outrage
on
art
false
in
conception
and
barbarous
in
execution
the
statuary
that
infests
american
cities
has
as
much
relation
to
true
art
as
a
totem
to
a
michael
angelo
yet
that
is
the
only
art
that
succeeds
the
true
artistic
genius
who
will
not
cater
to
accepted
notions
who
exercises
originality
and
strives
to
be
true
to
life
leads
an
obscure
and
wretched
existence
his
work
may
some
day
become
the
fad
of
the
mob
but
not
until
his
heart
blood
had
been
exhausted
not
until
the
pathfinder
has
ceased
to
be
and
a
throng
of
an
idealless
and
visionless
mob
has
done
to
death
the
heritage
of
the
master
it
is
said
that
the
artist
of
today
can
not
create
because
he
is
bound
to
the
rock
of
economic
necessity
this
however
is
true
of
art
in
all
ages
michael
angelo
was
dependent
on
his
patron
saint
no
less
than
the
sculptor
or
painter
of
today
except
that
the
art
connoisseurs
of
those
days
were
far
away
from
the
madding
crowd
they
felt
honored
to
be
permitted
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
master
the
art
protector
of
our
time
knows
but
one
criterion
one
value
the
dollar
he
is
not
concerned
about
the
quality
of
any
great
work
but
in
the
quantity
of
dollars
his
purchase
implies
thus
the
financier
in
mirbeau
les
affaires
sont
les
affaires
points
to
some
blurred
arrangement
in
colors
saying
see
how
great
it
is
it
cost
francs
just
like
our
own
parvenues
the
fabulous
figures
paid
for
their
great
art
discoveries
must
make
up
for
the
poverty
of
their
taste
the
most
unpardonable
sin
in
society
is
independence
of
thought
that
this
should
be
so
terribly
apparent
in
a
country
whose
symbol
is
democracy
is
very
significant
of
the
tremendous
power
of
the
majority
wendell
phillips
said
fifty
years
ago
in
our
country
of
absolute
democratic
equality
public
opinion
is
not
only
omnipotent
it
is
omnipresent
there
is
no
refuge
from
its
tyranny
there
is
no
hiding
from
its
reach
and
the
result
is
that
if
you
take
the
old
greek
lantern
and
go
about
to
seek
among
a
hundred
you
will
not
find
a
single
american
who
has
not
or
who
does
not
fancy
at
least
he
has
something
to
gain
or
lose
in
his
ambition
his
social
life
or
business
from
the
good
opinion
and
the
votes
of
those
around
him
and
the
consequence
is
that
instead
of
being
a
mass
of
individuals
each
one
fearlessly
blurting
out
his
own
conviction
as
a
nation
compared
to
other
nations
we
are
a
mass
of
cowards
more
than
any
other
people
we
are
afraid
of
each
other
evidently
we
have
not
advanced
very
far
from
the
condition
that
confronted
wendell
phillips
today
as
then
public
opinion
is
the
omnipresent
tyrant
today
as
then
the
majority
represents
a
mass
of
cowards
willing
to
accept
him
who
mirrors
its
own
soul
and
mind
poverty
that
accounts
for
the
unprecedented
rise
of
a
man
like
roosevelt
he
embodies
the
very
worst
element
of
mob
psychology
a
politician
he
knows
that
the
majority
cares
little
for
ideals
or
integrity
what
it
craves
is
display
it
matters
not
whether
that
be
a
dog
show
a
prize
fight
the
lynching
of
a
nigger
the
rounding
up
of
some
petty
offender
the
marriage
exposition
of
an
heiress
or
the
acrobatic
stunts
of
an
the
more
hideous
the
mental
contortions
the
greater
the
delight
and
bravos
of
the
mass
thus
poor
in
ideals
and
vulgar
of
soul
roosevelt
continues
to
be
the
man
of
the
hour
on
the
other
hand
men
towering
high
above
such
political
pygmies
men
of
refinement
of
culture
of
ability
are
jeered
into
silence
as
mollycoddles
it
is
absurd
to
claim
that
ours
is
the
era
of
individualism
ours
is
merely
a
more
poignant
repetition
of
the
phenomenon
of
all
history
every
effort
for
progress
for
enlightenment
for
science
for
religious
political
and
economic
liberty
emanates
from
the
minority
and
not
from
the
mass
today
as
ever
the
few
are
misunderstood
hounded
imprisoned
tortured
and
killed
the
principle
of
brotherhood
expounded
by
the
agitator
of
nazareth
preserved
the
germ
of
life
of
truth
and
justice
so
long
as
it
was
the
beacon
light
of
the
few
the
moment
the
majority
seized
upon
it
that
great
principle
became
a
shibboleth
and
harbinger
of
blood
and
fire
spreading
suffering
and
disaster
the
attack
on
the
omnipotence
of
rome
was
like
a
sunrise
amid
the
darkness
of
the
night
only
so
long
as
it
was
made
by
the
colossal
figures
of
a
huss
a
calvin
or
a
luther
yet
when
the
mass
joined
in
the
procession
against
the
catholic
monster
it
was
no
less
cruel
no
less
bloodthirsty
than
its
enemy
woe
to
the
heretics
to
the
minority
who
would
not
bow
to
its
dicta
after
infinite
zeal
endurance
and
sacrifice
the
human
mind
is
at
last
free
from
the
religious
phantom
the
minority
has
gone
on
in
pursuit
of
new
conquests
and
the
majority
is
lagging
behind
handicapped
by
truth
grown
false
with
age
politically
the
human
race
would
still
be
in
the
most
absolute
slavery
were
it
not
for
the
john
balls
the
wat
tylers
the
tells
the
innumerable
individual
giants
who
fought
inch
by
inch
against
the
power
of
kings
and
tyrants
but
for
individual
pioneers
the
world
would
have
never
been
shaken
to
its
very
roots
by
that
tremendous
wave
the
french
revolution
great
events
are
usually
preceded
by
apparently
small
things
thus
the
eloquence
and
fire
of
camille
desmoulins
was
like
the
trumpet
before
jericho
razing
to
the
ground
that
emblem
of
torture
of
abuse
of
horror
the
bastille
always
at
every
period
the
few
were
the
banner
bearers
of
a
great
idea
of
liberating
effort
not
so
the
mass
the
leaden
weight
of
which
does
not
let
it
move
the
truth
of
this
is
borne
out
in
russia
with
greater
force
than
elsewhere
thousands
of
lives
have
already
been
consumed
by
that
bloody
regime
yet
the
monster
on
the
throne
is
not
appeased
how
is
such
a
thing
possible
when
ideas
culture
literature
when
the
deepest
and
finest
emotions
groan
under
the
iron
yoke
the
majority
that
compact
immobile
drowsy
mass
the
russian
peasant
after
a
century
of
struggle
of
sacrifice
of
untold
misery
still
believes
that
the
rope
which
strangles
the
man
with
the
white
hands
brings
luck
in
the
american
struggle
for
liberty
the
majority
was
no
less
of
a
stumbling
block
until
this
very
day
the
ideas
of
jefferson
of
patrick
henry
of
thomas
paine
are
denied
and
sold
by
their
posterity
the
mass
wants
none
of
them
the
greatness
and
courage
worshipped
in
lincoln
have
been
forgotten
in
the
men
who
created
the
background
for
the
panorama
of
that
time
the
true
patron
saints
of
the
black
men
were
represented
in
that
handful
of
fighters
in
boston
lloyd
garrison
wendell
phillips
thoreau
margaret
fuller
and
theodore
parker
whose
great
courage
and
sturdiness
culminated
in
that
somber
giant
john
brown
their
untiring
zeal
their
eloquence
and
perseverance
undermined
the
stronghold
of
the
southern
lords
lincoln
and
his
minions
followed
only
when
abolition
had
become
a
practical
issue
recognized
as
such
by
all
about
fifty
years
ago
a
idea
made
its
appearance
on
the
social
horizon
of
the
world
an
idea
so
so
revolutionary
so
as
to
spread
terror
in
the
hearts
of
tyrants
everywhere
on
the
other
hand
that
idea
was
a
harbinger
of
joy
of
cheer
of
hope
to
the
millions
the
pioneers
knew
the
difficulties
in
their
way
they
knew
the
opposition
the
persecution
the
hardships
that
would
meet
them
but
proud
and
unafraid
they
started
on
their
march
onward
ever
onward
now
that
idea
has
become
a
popular
slogan
almost
everyone
is
a
socialist
today
the
rich
man
as
well
as
his
poor
victim
the
upholders
of
law
and
authority
as
well
as
their
unfortunate
culprits
the
freethinker
as
well
as
the
perpetuator
of
religious
falsehoods
the
fashionable
lady
as
well
as
the
shirtwaist
girl
why
not
now
that
the
truth
of
fifty
years
ago
has
become
a
lie
now
that
it
has
been
clipped
of
all
its
youthful
imagination
and
been
robbed
of
its
vigor
its
strength
its
revolutionary
ideal
why
not
now
that
it
is
no
longer
a
beautiful
vision
but
a
practical
workable
scheme
resting
on
the
will
of
the
majority
why
not
with
the
same
political
cunning
and
shrewdness
the
mass
is
petted
pampered
cheated
daily
its
praise
is
being
sung
in
many
keys
the
poor
majority
the
outraged
the
abused
the
giant
majority
if
only
it
would
follow
us
who
has
not
heard
this
litany
before
who
does
not
know
this
refrain
of
all
politicians
that
the
mass
bleeds
that
it
is
being
robbed
and
exploited
i
know
as
well
as
our
but
i
insist
that
not
the
handful
of
parasites
but
the
mass
itself
is
responsible
for
this
horrible
state
of
affairs
it
clings
to
its
masters
loves
the
whip
and
is
the
first
to
cry
crucify
the
moment
a
protesting
voice
is
raised
against
the
sacredness
of
capitalistic
authority
or
any
other
decayed
institution
yet
how
long
would
authority
and
private
property
exist
if
not
for
the
willingness
of
the
mass
to
become
soldiers
policemen
jailers
and
hangmen
the
socialist
demagogues
know
that
as
well
as
i
but
they
maintain
the
myth
of
the
virtues
of
the
majority
because
their
very
scheme
of
life
means
the
perpetuation
of
power
and
how
could
the
latter
be
acquired
without
numbers
yes
power
authority
coercion
and
dependence
rest
on
the
mass
but
never
freedom
never
the
free
unfoldment
of
the
individual
never
the
birth
of
a
free
society
not
because
i
do
not
feel
with
the
oppressed
the
disinherited
of
the
earth
not
because
i
do
not
know
the
shame
the
horror
the
indignity
of
the
lives
the
people
lead
do
i
repudiate
the
majority
as
a
creative
force
for
good
oh
no
no
but
because
i
know
so
well
that
as
a
compact
mass
it
has
never
stood
for
justice
or
equality
it
has
suppressed
the
human
voice
subdued
the
human
spirit
chained
the
human
body
as
a
mass
its
aim
has
always
been
to
make
life
uniform
gray
and
monotonous
as
the
desert
as
a
mass
it
will
always
be
the
annihilator
of
individuality
of
free
initiative
of
originality
i
therefore
believe
with
emerson
that
the
masses
are
crude
lame
pernicious
in
their
demands
and
influence
and
need
not
to
be
flattered
but
to
be
schooled
i
wish
not
to
concede
anything
to
them
but
to
drill
divide
and
break
them
up
and
draw
individuals
out
of
them
masses
the
calamity
are
the
masses
i
do
not
wish
any
mass
at
all
but
honest
men
only
lovely
sweet
accomplished
women
only
in
other
words
the
living
vital
truth
of
social
and
economic
will
become
a
reality
only
through
the
zeal
courage
the
determination
of
intelligent
minorities
and
not
through
the
mass
the
intellectuals
the
psychology
of
political
violence
to
analyze
the
psychology
of
political
violence
is
not
only
extremely
difficult
but
also
very
dangerous
if
such
acts
are
treated
with
understanding
one
is
immediately
accused
of
eulogizing
them
if
on
the
other
hand
human
sympathy
is
expressed
with
the
attentater
one
risks
being
considered
a
possible
accomplice
yet
it
is
only
intelligence
and
sympathy
that
can
bring
us
closer
to
the
source
of
human
suffering
and
teach
us
the
ultimate
way
out
of
it
the
primitive
man
ignorant
of
natural
forces
dreaded
their
approach
hiding
from
the
perils
they
threatened
as
man
learned
to
understand
nature
phenomena
he
realized
that
though
these
may
destroy
life
and
cause
great
loss
they
also
bring
relief
to
the
earnest
student
it
must
be
apparent
that
the
accumulated
forces
in
our
social
and
economic
life
culminating
in
a
political
act
of
violence
are
similar
to
the
terrors
of
the
atmosphere
manifested
in
storm
and
lightning
to
thoroughly
appreciate
the
truth
of
this
view
one
must
feel
intensely
the
indignity
of
our
social
wrongs
one
very
being
must
throb
with
the
pain
the
sorrow
the
despair
millions
of
people
are
daily
made
to
endure
indeed
unless
we
have
become
a
part
of
humanity
we
can
not
even
faintly
understand
the
just
indignation
that
accumulates
in
a
human
soul
the
burning
surging
passion
that
makes
the
storm
inevitable
the
ignorant
mass
looks
upon
the
man
who
makes
a
violent
protest
against
our
social
and
economic
iniquities
as
upon
a
wild
beast
a
cruel
heartless
monster
whose
joy
it
is
to
destroy
life
and
bathe
in
blood
or
at
best
as
upon
an
irresponsible
lunatic
yet
nothing
is
further
from
the
truth
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
who
have
studied
the
character
and
personality
of
these
men
or
who
have
come
in
close
contact
with
them
are
agreed
that
it
is
their
to
the
wrong
and
injustice
surrounding
them
which
compels
them
to
pay
the
toll
of
our
social
crimes
the
most
noted
writers
and
poets
discussing
the
psychology
of
political
offenders
have
paid
them
the
highest
tribute
could
anyone
assume
that
these
men
had
advised
violence
or
even
approved
of
the
acts
certainly
not
theirs
was
the
attitude
of
the
social
student
of
the
man
who
knows
that
beyond
every
violent
act
there
is
a
vital
cause
bjornstjerne
bjornson
in
the
second
part
of
beyond
human
power
emphasizes
the
fact
that
it
is
among
the
anarchists
that
we
must
look
for
the
modern
martyrs
who
pay
for
their
faith
with
their
blood
and
who
welcome
death
with
a
smile
because
they
believe
as
truly
as
christ
did
that
their
martyrdom
will
redeem
humanity
francois
coppee
the
french
novelist
thus
expresses
himself
regarding
the
psychology
of
the
attentater
the
reading
of
the
details
of
vaillant
execution
left
me
in
a
thoughtful
mood
i
imagined
him
expanding
his
chest
under
the
ropes
marching
with
firm
step
stiffening
his
will
concentrating
all
his
energy
and
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
knife
hurling
finally
at
society
his
cry
of
malediction
and
in
spite
of
me
another
spectacle
rose
suddenly
before
my
mind
i
saw
a
group
of
men
and
women
pressing
against
each
other
in
the
middle
of
the
oblong
arena
of
the
circus
under
the
gaze
of
thousands
of
eyes
while
from
all
the
steps
of
the
immense
amphitheatre
went
up
the
terrible
cry
ad
leones
and
below
the
opening
cages
of
the
wild
beasts
i
did
not
believe
the
execution
would
take
place
in
the
first
place
no
victim
had
been
struck
with
death
and
it
had
long
been
the
custom
not
to
punish
an
abortive
crime
with
the
last
degree
of
severity
then
this
crime
however
terrible
in
intention
was
disinterested
born
of
an
abstract
idea
the
man
past
his
abandoned
childhood
his
life
of
hardship
pleaded
also
in
his
favor
in
the
independent
press
generous
voices
were
raised
in
his
behalf
very
loud
and
eloquent
purely
literary
current
of
opinion
some
have
said
with
no
little
scorn
it
is
on
the
contrary
an
honor
to
the
men
of
art
and
thought
to
have
expressed
once
more
their
disgust
at
the
scaffold
again
zola
in
germinal
and
paris
describes
the
tenderness
and
kindness
the
deep
sympathy
with
human
suffering
of
these
men
who
close
the
chapter
of
their
lives
with
a
violent
outbreak
against
our
system
last
but
not
least
the
man
who
probably
better
than
anyone
else
understands
the
psychology
of
the
attentater
is
hamon
the
author
of
the
brilliant
work
une
psychologie
du
militaire
professionel
who
has
arrived
at
these
suggestive
conclusions
the
positive
method
confirmed
by
the
rational
method
enables
us
to
establish
an
ideal
type
of
anarchist
whose
mentality
is
the
aggregate
of
common
psychic
characteristics
every
anarchist
partakes
sufficiently
of
this
ideal
type
to
make
it
possible
to
differentiate
him
from
other
men
the
typical
anarchist
then
may
be
defined
as
follows
a
man
perceptible
by
the
spirit
of
revolt
under
one
or
more
of
its
forms
opposition
investigation
criticism
innovation
endowed
with
a
strong
love
of
liberty
egoistic
or
individualistic
and
possessed
of
great
curiosity
a
keen
desire
to
know
these
traits
are
supplemented
by
an
ardent
love
of
others
a
highly
developed
moral
sensitiveness
a
profound
sentiment
of
justice
and
imbued
with
missionary
zeal
to
the
above
characteristics
says
alvin
sanborn
must
be
added
these
sterling
qualities
a
rare
love
of
animals
surpassing
sweetness
in
all
the
ordinary
relations
of
life
exceptional
sobriety
of
demeanor
frugality
and
regularity
austerity
even
of
living
and
courage
beyond
compare
there
is
a
truism
that
the
man
in
the
street
seems
always
to
forget
when
he
is
abusing
the
anarchists
or
whatever
party
happens
to
be
his
bete
noire
for
the
moment
as
the
cause
of
some
outrage
just
perpetrated
this
indisputable
fact
is
that
homicidal
outrages
have
from
time
immemorial
been
the
reply
of
goaded
and
desperate
classes
and
goaded
and
desperate
individuals
to
wrongs
from
their
fellowmen
which
they
felt
to
be
intolerable
such
acts
are
the
violent
recoil
from
violence
whether
aggressive
or
repressive
they
are
the
last
desperate
struggle
of
outraged
and
exasperated
human
nature
for
breathing
space
and
life
and
their
cause
lies
not
in
any
special
conviction
but
in
the
depths
of
that
human
nature
itself
the
whole
course
of
history
political
and
social
is
strewn
with
evidence
of
this
fact
to
go
no
further
take
the
three
most
notorious
examples
of
political
parties
goaded
into
violence
during
the
last
fifty
years
the
mazzinians
in
italy
the
fenians
in
ireland
and
the
terrorists
in
russia
were
these
people
anarchists
no
did
they
all
three
even
hold
the
same
political
opinions
no
the
mazzinians
were
republicans
the
fenians
political
separatists
the
russians
social
democrats
or
constitutionalists
but
all
were
driven
by
desperate
circumstances
into
this
terrible
form
of
revolt
and
when
we
turn
from
parties
to
individuals
who
have
acted
in
like
manner
we
stand
appalled
by
the
number
of
human
beings
goaded
and
driven
by
sheer
desperation
into
conduct
obviously
violently
opposed
to
their
social
instincts
now
that
anarchism
has
become
a
living
force
in
society
such
deeds
have
been
sometimes
committed
by
anarchists
as
well
as
by
others
for
no
new
faith
even
the
most
essentially
peaceable
and
humane
the
mind
of
man
has
yet
accepted
but
at
its
first
coming
has
brought
upon
earth
not
peace
but
a
sword
not
because
of
anything
violent
or
in
the
doctrine
itself
simply
because
of
the
ferment
any
new
and
creative
idea
excites
in
men
minds
whether
they
accept
or
reject
it
and
a
conception
of
anarchism
which
on
one
hand
threatens
every
vested
interest
and
on
the
other
holds
out
a
vision
of
a
free
and
noble
life
to
be
won
by
a
struggle
against
existing
wrongs
is
certain
to
rouse
the
fiercest
opposition
and
bring
the
whole
repressive
force
of
ancient
evil
into
violent
contact
with
the
tumultuous
outburst
of
a
new
hope
under
miserable
conditions
of
life
any
vision
of
the
possibility
of
better
things
makes
the
present
misery
more
intolerable
and
spurs
those
who
suffer
to
the
most
energetic
struggles
to
improve
their
lot
and
if
these
struggles
only
immediately
result
in
sharper
misery
the
outcome
is
sheer
desperation
in
our
present
society
for
instance
an
exploited
wage
worker
who
catches
a
glimpse
of
what
work
and
life
might
and
ought
to
be
finds
the
toilsome
routine
and
the
squalor
of
his
existence
almost
intolerable
and
even
when
he
has
the
resolution
and
courage
to
continue
steadily
working
his
best
and
waiting
until
new
ideas
have
so
permeated
society
as
to
pave
the
way
for
better
times
the
mere
fact
that
he
has
such
ideas
and
tries
to
spread
them
brings
him
into
difficulties
with
his
employers
how
many
thousands
of
socialists
and
above
all
anarchists
have
lost
work
and
even
the
chance
of
work
solely
on
the
ground
of
their
opinions
it
is
only
the
specially
gifted
craftsman
who
if
he
be
a
zealous
propagandist
can
hope
to
retain
permanent
employment
and
what
happens
to
a
man
with
his
brain
working
actively
with
a
ferment
of
new
ideas
with
a
vision
before
his
eyes
of
a
new
hope
dawning
for
toiling
and
agonizing
men
with
the
knowledge
that
his
suffering
and
that
of
his
fellows
in
misery
is
not
caused
by
the
cruelty
of
fate
but
by
the
injustice
of
other
human
beings
what
happens
to
such
a
man
when
he
sees
those
dear
to
him
starving
when
he
himself
is
starved
some
natures
in
such
a
plight
and
those
by
no
means
the
least
social
or
the
least
sensitive
will
become
violent
and
will
even
feel
that
their
violence
is
social
and
not
that
in
striking
when
and
how
they
can
they
are
striking
not
for
themselves
but
for
human
nature
outraged
and
despoiled
in
their
persons
and
in
those
of
their
fellow
sufferers
and
are
we
who
ourselves
are
not
in
this
horrible
predicament
to
stand
by
and
coldly
condemn
these
piteous
victims
of
the
furies
and
fates
are
we
to
decry
as
miscreants
these
human
beings
who
act
with
heroic
sacrificing
their
lives
in
protest
where
less
social
and
less
energetic
natures
would
lie
down
and
grovel
in
abject
submission
to
injustice
and
wrong
are
we
to
join
the
ignorant
and
brutal
outcry
which
stigmatizes
such
men
as
monsters
of
wickedness
gratuitously
running
amuck
in
a
harmonious
and
innocently
peaceful
society
no
we
hate
murder
with
a
hatred
that
may
seem
absurdly
exaggerated
to
apologists
for
matabele
massacres
to
callous
acquiescers
in
hangings
and
bombardments
but
we
decline
in
such
cases
of
homicide
or
attempted
homicide
as
those
of
which
we
are
treating
to
be
guilty
of
the
cruel
injustice
of
flinging
the
whole
responsibility
of
the
deed
upon
the
immediate
perpetrator
the
guilt
of
these
homicides
lies
upon
every
man
and
woman
who
intentionally
or
by
cold
indifference
helps
to
keep
up
social
conditions
that
drive
human
beings
to
despair
the
man
who
flings
his
whole
life
into
the
attempt
at
the
cost
of
his
own
life
to
protest
against
the
wrongs
of
his
fellow
men
is
a
saint
compared
to
the
active
and
passive
upholders
of
cruelty
and
injustice
even
if
his
protest
destroy
other
lives
besides
his
own
let
him
who
is
without
sin
in
society
cast
the
first
stone
at
such
an
one
that
every
act
of
political
violence
should
nowadays
be
attributed
to
anarchists
is
not
at
all
surprising
yet
it
is
a
fact
known
to
almost
everyone
familiar
with
the
anarchist
movement
that
a
great
number
of
acts
for
which
anarchists
had
to
suffer
either
originated
with
the
capitalist
press
or
were
instigated
if
not
directly
perpetrated
by
the
police
for
a
number
of
years
acts
of
violence
had
been
committed
in
spain
for
which
the
anarchists
were
held
responsible
hounded
like
wild
beasts
and
thrown
into
prison
later
it
was
disclosed
that
the
perpetrators
of
these
acts
were
not
anarchists
but
members
of
the
police
department
the
scandal
became
so
widespread
that
the
conservative
spanish
papers
demanded
the
apprehension
and
punishment
of
the
juan
rull
who
was
subsequently
condemned
to
death
and
executed
the
sensational
evidence
brought
to
light
during
the
trial
forced
police
inspector
momento
to
exonerate
completely
the
anarchists
from
any
connection
with
the
acts
committed
during
a
long
period
this
resulted
in
the
dismissal
of
a
number
of
police
officials
among
them
inspector
tressols
who
in
revenge
disclosed
the
fact
that
behind
the
gang
of
police
bomb
throwers
were
others
of
far
higher
position
who
provided
them
with
funds
and
protected
them
this
is
one
of
the
many
striking
examples
of
how
anarchist
conspiracies
are
manufactured
that
the
american
police
can
perjure
themselves
with
the
same
ease
that
they
are
just
as
merciless
just
as
brutal
and
cunning
as
their
european
colleagues
has
been
proven
on
more
than
one
occasion
we
need
only
recall
the
tragedy
of
the
eleventh
of
november
known
as
the
haymarket
riot
no
one
who
is
at
all
familiar
with
the
case
can
possibly
doubt
that
the
anarchists
judicially
murdered
in
chicago
died
as
victims
of
a
lying
bloodthirsty
press
and
of
a
cruel
police
conspiracy
has
not
judge
gary
himself
said
not
because
you
have
caused
the
haymarket
bomb
but
because
you
are
anarchists
you
are
on
trial
the
impartial
and
thorough
analysis
by
governor
altgeld
of
that
blotch
on
the
american
escutcheon
verified
the
brutal
frankness
of
judge
gary
it
was
this
that
induced
altgeld
to
pardon
the
three
anarchists
thereby
earning
the
lasting
esteem
of
every
liberty
loving
man
and
woman
in
the
world
when
we
approach
the
tragedy
of
september
sixth
we
are
confronted
by
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
how
little
social
theories
are
responsible
for
an
act
of
political
violence
leon
czolgosz
an
anarchist
incited
to
commit
the
act
by
emma
goldman
to
be
sure
has
she
not
incited
violence
even
before
her
birth
and
will
she
not
continue
to
do
so
beyond
death
everything
is
possible
with
the
anarchists
today
even
nine
years
after
the
tragedy
after
it
was
proven
a
hundred
times
that
emma
goldman
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
event
that
no
evidence
whatsoever
exists
to
indicate
that
czolgosz
ever
called
himself
an
anarchist
we
are
confronted
with
the
same
lie
fabricated
by
the
police
and
perpetuated
by
the
press
no
living
soul
ever
heard
czolgosz
make
that
statement
nor
is
there
a
single
written
word
to
prove
that
the
boy
ever
breathed
the
accusation
nothing
but
ignorance
and
insane
hysteria
which
have
never
yet
been
able
to
solve
the
simplest
problem
of
cause
and
effect
the
president
of
a
free
republic
killed
what
else
can
be
the
cause
except
that
the
attentater
must
have
been
insane
or
that
he
was
incited
to
the
act
a
free
republic
how
a
myth
will
maintain
itself
how
it
will
continue
to
deceive
to
dupe
and
blind
even
the
comparatively
intelligent
to
its
monstrous
absurdities
a
free
republic
and
yet
within
a
little
over
thirty
years
a
small
band
of
parasites
have
successfully
robbed
the
american
people
and
trampled
upon
the
fundamental
principles
laid
down
by
the
fathers
of
this
country
guaranteeing
to
every
man
woman
and
child
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
for
thirty
years
they
have
been
increasing
their
wealth
and
power
at
the
expense
of
the
vast
mass
of
workers
thereby
enlarging
the
army
of
the
unemployed
the
hungry
homeless
and
friendless
portion
of
humanity
who
are
tramping
the
country
from
east
to
west
from
north
to
south
in
a
vain
search
for
work
for
many
years
the
home
has
been
left
to
the
care
of
the
little
ones
while
the
parents
are
exhausting
their
life
and
strength
for
a
mere
pittance
for
thirty
years

sturdy
sons
of
america
have
been
sacrificed
on
the
battlefield
of
industrial
war
and
the
daughters
outraged
in
corrupt
factory
surroundings
for
long
and
weary
years
this
process
of
undermining
the
nation
health
vigor
and
pride
without
much
protest
from
the
disinherited
and
oppressed
has
been
going
on
maddened
by
success
and
victory
the
money
powers
of
this
free
land
of
ours
became
more
and
more
audacious
in
their
heartless
cruel
efforts
to
compete
with
the
rotten
and
decayed
european
tyrannies
for
supremacy
of
power
in
vain
did
a
lying
press
repudiate
leon
czolgosz
as
a
foreigner
the
boy
was
a
product
of
our
own
free
american
soil
that
lulled
him
to
sleep
with
my
country
is
of
thee
sweet
land
of
liberty
who
can
tell
how
many
times
this
american
child
had
gloried
in
the
celebration
of
the
fourth
of
july
or
of
decoration
day
when
he
faithfully
honored
the
nation
dead
who
knows
but
that
he
too
was
willing
to
fight
for
his
country
and
die
for
her
liberty
until
it
dawned
upon
him
that
those
he
belonged
to
have
no
country
because
they
have
been
robbed
of
all
that
they
have
produced
until
he
realized
that
the
liberty
and
independence
of
his
youthful
dreams
were
but
a
farce
poor
leon
czolgosz
your
crime
consisted
of
too
sensitive
a
social
consciousness
unlike
your
idealless
and
brainless
american
brothers
your
ideals
soared
above
the
belly
and
the
bank
account
no
wonder
you
impressed
the
one
human
being
among
all
the
infuriated
mob
at
your
trial
a
newspaper
woman
as
a
visionary
totally
oblivious
to
your
surroundings
your
large
dreamy
eyes
must
have
beheld
a
new
and
glorious
dawn
now
to
a
recent
instance
of
anarchist
plots
in
that
bloodstained
city
chicago
the
life
of
chief
of
police
shippy
was
attempted
by
a
young
man
named
averbuch
immediately
the
cry
was
sent
to
the
four
corners
of
the
world
that
averbuch
was
an
anarchist
and
that
anarchists
were
responsible
for
the
act
everyone
who
was
at
all
known
to
entertain
anarchist
ideas
was
closely
watched
a
number
of
people
arrested
the
library
of
an
anarchist
group
confiscated
and
all
meetings
made
impossible
it
goes
without
saying
that
as
on
various
previous
occasions
i
must
needs
be
held
responsible
for
the
act
evidently
the
american
police
credit
me
with
occult
powers
i
did
not
know
averbuch
in
fact
had
never
before
heard
his
name
and
the
only
way
i
could
have
possibly
conspired
with
him
was
in
my
astral
body
but
then
the
police
are
not
concerned
with
logic
or
justice
what
they
seek
is
a
target
to
mask
their
absolute
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
the
psychology
of
a
political
act
was
averbuch
an
anarchist
there
is
no
positive
proof
of
it
he
had
been
but
three
months
in
the
country
did
not
know
the
language
and
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
was
quite
unknown
to
the
anarchists
of
chicago
what
led
to
his
act
averbuch
like
most
young
russian
immigrants
undoubtedly
believed
in
the
mythical
liberty
of
america
he
received
his
first
baptism
by
the
policeman
club
during
the
brutal
dispersement
of
the
unemployed
parade
he
further
experienced
american
equality
and
opportunity
in
the
vain
efforts
to
find
an
economic
master
in
short
a
three
months
sojourn
in
the
glorious
land
brought
him
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
the
disinherited
are
in
the
same
position
the
world
over
in
his
native
land
he
probably
learned
that
necessity
knows
no
law
there
was
no
difference
between
a
russian
and
an
american
policeman
the
question
to
the
intelligent
social
student
is
not
whether
the
acts
of
czolgosz
or
averbuch
were
practical
any
more
than
whether
the
thunderstorm
is
practical
the
thing
that
will
inevitably
impress
itself
on
the
thinking
and
feeling
man
and
woman
is
that
the
sight
of
brutal
clubbing
of
innocent
victims
in
a
free
republic
and
the
degrading
economic
struggle
furnish
the
spark
that
kindles
the
dynamic
force
in
the
overwrought
outraged
souls
of
men
like
czolgosz
or
averbuch
no
amount
of
persecution
of
hounding
of
repression
can
stay
this
social
phenomenon
but
it
is
often
asked
have
not
acknowledged
anarchists
committed
acts
of
violence
certainly
they
have
always
however
ready
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
my
contention
is
that
they
were
impelled
not
by
the
teachings
of
anarchism
but
by
the
tremendous
pressure
of
conditions
making
life
unbearable
to
their
sensitive
natures
obviously
anarchism
or
any
other
social
theory
making
man
a
conscious
social
unit
will
act
as
a
leaven
for
rebellion
this
is
not
a
mere
assertion
but
a
fact
verified
by
all
experience
a
close
examination
of
the
circumstances
bearing
upon
this
question
will
further
clarify
my
position
let
us
consider
some
of
the
most
important
anarchist
acts
within
the
last
two
decades
strange
as
it
may
seem
one
of
the
most
significant
deeds
of
political
violence
occurred
here
in
america
in
connection
with
the
homestead
strike
of
during
that
memorable
time
the
carnegie
steel
company
organized
a
conspiracy
to
crush
the
amalgamated
association
of
iron
and
steel
workers
henry
clay
frick
then
chairman
of
the
company
was
intrusted
with
that
democratic
task
he
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
the
policy
of
breaking
the
union
the
policy
which
he
had
so
successfully
practiced
during
his
reign
of
terror
in
the
coke
regions
secretly
and
while
peace
negotiations
were
being
purposely
prolonged
frick
supervised
the
military
preparations
the
fortification
of
the
homestead
steel
works
the
erection
of
a
high
board
fence
capped
with
barbed
wire
and
provided
with
loopholes
for
sharpshooters
and
then
in
the
dead
of
night
he
attempted
to
smuggle
his
army
of
hired
pinkerton
thugs
into
homestead
which
act
precipitated
the
terrible
carnage
of
the
steel
workers
not
content
with
the
death
of
eleven
victims
killed
in
the
pinkerton
skirmish
henry
clay
frick
good
christian
and
free
american
straightway
began
the
hounding
down
of
the
helpless
wives
and
orphans
by
ordering
them
out
of
the
wretched
company
houses
the
whole
country
was
aroused
over
these
inhuman
outrages
hundreds
of
voices
were
raised
in
protest
calling
on
frick
to
desist
not
to
go
too
far
yes
hundreds
of
people
protested
as
one
objects
to
annoying
flies
only
one
there
was
who
actively
responded
to
the
outrage
at
homestead
alexander
berkman
yes
he
was
an
anarchist
he
gloried
in
that
fact
because
it
was
the
only
force
that
made
the
discord
between
his
spiritual
longing
and
the
world
without
at
all
bearable
yet
not
anarchism
as
such
but
the
brutal
slaughter
of
the
eleven
steel
workers
was
the
urge
for
alexander
berkman
act
his
attempt
on
the
life
of
henry
clay
frick
the
record
of
european
acts
of
political
violence
affords
numerous
and
striking
instances
of
the
influence
of
environment
upon
sensitive
human
beings
the
court
speech
of
vaillant
who
in
exploded
a
bomb
in
the
paris
chamber
of
deputies
strikes
the
true
keynote
of
the
psychology
of
such
acts
gentlemen
in
a
few
minutes
you
are
to
deal
your
blow
but
in
receiving
your
verdict
i
shall
have
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
having
wounded
the
existing
society
that
cursed
society
in
which
one
may
see
a
single
man
spending
uselessly
enough
to
feed
thousands
of
families
an
infamous
society
which
permits
a
few
individuals
to
monopolize
all
the
social
wealth
while
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
unfortunates
who
have
not
even
the
bread
that
is
not
refused
to
dogs
and
while
entire
families
are
committing
suicide
for
want
of
the
necessities
of
life
ah
gentlemen
if
the
governing
classes
could
go
down
among
the
unfortunates
but
no
they
prefer
to
remain
deaf
to
their
appeals
it
seems
that
a
fatality
impels
them
like
the
royalty
of
the
eighteenth
century
toward
the
precipice
which
will
engulf
them
for
woe
be
to
those
who
remain
deaf
to
the
cries
of
the
starving
woe
to
those
who
believing
themselves
of
superior
essence
assume
the
right
to
exploit
those
beneath
them
there
comes
a
time
when
the
people
no
longer
reason
they
rise
like
a
hurricane
and
pass
away
like
a
torrent
then
we
see
bleeding
heads
impaled
on
pikes
among
the
exploited
gentlemen
there
are
two
classes
of
individuals
those
of
one
class
not
realizing
what
they
are
and
what
they
might
be
take
life
as
it
comes
believe
that
they
are
born
to
be
slaves
and
content
themselves
with
the
little
that
is
given
them
in
exchange
for
their
labor
but
there
are
others
on
the
contrary
who
think
who
study
and
who
looking
about
them
discover
social
iniquities
is
it
their
fault
if
they
see
clearly
and
suffer
at
seeing
others
suffer
then
they
throw
themselves
into
the
struggle
and
make
themselves
the
bearers
of
the
popular
claims
gentlemen
i
am
one
of
these
last
wherever
i
have
gone
i
have
seen
unfortunates
bent
beneath
the
yoke
of
capital
everywhere
i
have
seen
the
same
wounds
causing
tears
of
blood
to
flow
even
in
the
remoter
parts
of
the
inhabited
districts
of
south
america
where
i
had
the
right
to
believe
that
he
who
was
weary
of
the
pains
of
civilization
might
rest
in
the
shade
of
the
palm
trees
and
there
study
nature
well
there
even
more
than
elsewhere
i
have
seen
capital
come
like
a
vampire
to
suck
the
last
drop
of
blood
of
the
unfortunate
pariahs
then
i
came
back
to
france
where
it
was
reserved
for
me
to
see
my
family
suffer
atrociously
this
was
the
last
drop
in
the
cup
of
my
sorrow
tired
of
leading
this
life
of
suffering
and
cowardice
i
carried
this
bomb
to
those
who
are
primarily
responsible
for
social
sufferings
i
am
reproached
with
the
wounds
of
those
who
were
hit
by
my
projectiles
permit
me
to
point
out
in
passing
that
if
the
bourgeois
had
not
massacred
or
caused
massacres
during
the
revolution
it
is
probable
that
they
would
still
be
under
the
yoke
of
the
nobility
on
the
other
hand
figure
up
the
dead
and
wounded
on
tonquin
madagascar
dahomey
adding
thereto
the
thousands
yes
millions
of
unfortunates
who
die
in
the
factories
the
mines
and
wherever
the
grinding
power
of
capital
is
felt
add
also
those
who
die
of
hunger
and
all
this
with
the
assent
of
our
deputies
beside
all
this
of
how
little
weight
are
the
reproaches
now
brought
against
me
it
is
true
that
one
does
not
efface
the
other
but
after
all
are
we
not
acting
on
the
defensive
when
we
respond
to
the
blows
which
we
receive
from
above
i
know
very
well
that
i
shall
be
told
that
i
ought
to
have
confined
myself
to
speech
for
the
vindication
of
the
people
claims
but
what
can
you
expect
it
takes
a
loud
voice
to
make
the
deaf
hear
too
long
have
they
answered
our
voices
by
imprisonment
the
rope
rifle
volleys
make
no
mistake
the
explosion
of
my
bomb
is
not
only
the
cry
of
the
rebel
vaillant
but
the
cry
of
an
entire
class
which
vindicates
its
rights
and
which
will
soon
add
acts
to
words
for
be
sure
of
it
in
vain
will
they
pass
laws
the
ideas
of
the
thinkers
will
not
halt
just
as
in
the
last
century
all
the
governmental
forces
could
not
prevent
the
diderots
and
the
voltaires
from
spreading
emancipating
ideas
among
the
people
so
all
the
existing
governmental
forces
will
not
prevent
the
reclus
the
darwins
the
spencers
the
ibsens
the
mirbeaus
from
spreading
the
ideas
of
justice
and
liberty
which
will
annihilate
the
prejudices
that
hold
the
mass
in
ignorance
and
these
ideas
welcomed
by
the
unfortunate
will
flower
in
acts
of
revolt
as
they
have
done
in
me
until
the
day
when
the
disappearance
of
authority
shall
permit
all
men
to
organize
freely
according
to
their
choice
when
we
shall
each
be
able
to
enjoy
the
product
of
his
labor
and
when
those
moral
maladies
called
prejudices
shall
vanish
permitting
human
beings
to
live
in
harmony
having
no
other
desire
than
to
study
the
sciences
and
love
their
fellows
i
conclude
gentlemen
by
saying
that
a
society
in
which
one
sees
such
social
inequalities
as
we
see
all
about
us
in
which
we
see
every
day
suicides
caused
by
poverty
prostitution
flaring
at
every
street
corner
a
society
whose
principal
monuments
are
barracks
and
prisons
such
a
society
must
be
transformed
as
soon
as
possible
on
pain
of
being
eliminated
and
that
speedily
from
the
human
race
hail
to
him
who
labors
by
no
matter
what
means
for
this
transformation
it
is
this
idea
that
has
guided
me
in
my
duel
with
authority
but
as
in
this
duel
i
have
only
wounded
my
adversary
it
is
now
its
turn
to
strike
me
now
gentlemen
to
me
it
matters
little
what
penalty
you
may
inflict
for
looking
at
this
assembly
with
the
eyes
of
reason
i
can
not
help
smiling
to
see
you
atoms
lost
in
matter
and
reasoning
only
because
you
possess
a
prolongation
of
the
spinal
marrow
assume
the
right
to
judge
one
of
your
fellows
ah
gentlemen
how
little
a
thing
is
your
assembly
and
your
verdict
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
human
history
in
its
turn
is
likewise
a
very
little
thing
in
the
whirlwind
which
bears
it
through
immensity
and
which
is
destined
to
disappear
or
at
least
to
be
transformed
in
order
to
begin
again
the
same
history
and
the
same
facts
a
veritably
perpetual
play
of
cosmic
forces
renewing
and
transferring
themselves
forever
will
anyone
say
that
vaillant
was
an
ignorant
vicious
man
or
a
lunatic
was
not
his
mind
singularly
clear
analytic
no
wonder
that
the
best
intellectual
forces
of
france
spoke
in
his
behalf
and
signed
the
petition
to
president
carnot
asking
him
to
commute
vaillant
death
sentence
carnot
would
listen
to
no
entreaty
he
insisted
on
more
than
a
pound
of
flesh
he
wanted
vaillant
life
and
then
the
inevitable
happened
president
carnot
was
killed
on
the
handle
of
the
stiletto
used
by
the
attentater
was
engraved
significantly
vaillant
santa
caserio
was
an
anarchist
he
could
have
gotten
away
saved
himself
but
he
remained
he
stood
the
consequences
his
reasons
for
the
act
are
set
forth
in
so
simple
dignified
and
childlike
manner
that
one
is
reminded
of
the
touching
tribute
paid
caserio
by
his
teacher
of
the
little
village
school
ada
negri
the
italian
poet
who
spoke
of
him
as
a
sweet
tender
plant
of
too
fine
and
sensitive
texture
to
stand
the
cruel
strain
of
the
world
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
do
not
propose
to
make
a
defense
but
only
an
explanation
of
my
deed
since
my
early
youth
i
began
to
learn
that
present
society
is
badly
organized
so
badly
that
every
day
many
wretched
men
commit
suicide
leaving
women
and
children
in
the
most
terrible
distress
workers
by
thousands
seek
for
work
and
can
not
find
it
poor
families
beg
for
food
and
shiver
with
cold
they
suffer
the
greatest
misery
the
little
ones
ask
their
miserable
mothers
for
food
and
the
mothers
can
not
give
them
because
they
have
nothing
the
few
things
which
the
home
contained
have
already
been
sold
or
pawned
all
they
can
do
is
beg
alms
often
they
are
arrested
as
vagabonds
i
went
away
from
my
native
place
because
i
was
frequently
moved
to
tears
at
seeing
little
girls
of
eight
or
ten
years
obliged
to
work
fifteen
hours
a
day
for
the
paltry
pay
of
twenty
centimes
young
women
of
eighteen
or
twenty
also
work
fifteen
hours
daily
for
a
mockery
of
remuneration
and
that
happens
not
only
to
my
fellow
countrymen
but
to
all
the
workers
who
sweat
the
whole
day
long
for
a
crust
of
bread
while
their
labor
produces
wealth
in
abundance
the
workers
are
obliged
to
live
under
the
most
wretched
conditions
and
their
food
consists
of
a
little
bread
a
few
spoonfuls
of
rice
and
water
so
by
the
time
they
are
thirty
or
forty
years
old
they
are
exhausted
and
go
to
die
in
the
hospitals
besides
in
consequence
of
bad
food
and
overwork
these
unhappy
creatures
are
by
hundreds
devoured
by
pellagra
a
disease
that
in
my
country
attacks
as
the
physicians
say
those
who
are
badly
fed
and
lead
a
life
of
toil
and
privation
i
have
observed
that
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
are
hungry
and
many
children
who
suffer
whilst
bread
and
clothes
abound
in
the
towns
i
saw
many
and
large
shops
full
of
clothing
and
woolen
stuffs
and
i
also
saw
warehouses
full
of
wheat
and
indian
corn
suitable
for
those
who
are
in
want
and
on
the
other
hand
i
saw
thousands
of
people
who
do
not
work
who
produce
nothing
and
live
on
the
labor
of
others
who
spend
every
day
thousands
of
francs
for
their
amusement
who
debauch
the
daughters
of
the
workers
who
own
dwellings
of
forty
or
fifty
rooms
twenty
or
thirty
horses
many
servants
in
a
word
all
the
pleasures
of
life
i
believed
in
god
but
when
i
saw
so
great
an
inequality
between
men
i
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
god
who
created
man
but
man
who
created
god
and
i
discovered
that
those
who
want
their
property
to
be
respected
have
an
interest
in
preaching
the
existence
of
paradise
and
hell
and
in
keeping
the
people
in
ignorance
not
long
ago
vaillant
threw
a
bomb
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
to
protest
against
the
present
system
of
society
he
killed
no
one
only
wounded
some
persons
yet
bourgeois
justice
sentenced
him
to
death
and
not
satisfied
with
the
condemnation
of
the
guilty
man
they
began
to
pursue
the
anarchists
and
arrest
not
only
those
who
had
known
vaillant
but
even
those
who
had
merely
been
present
at
any
anarchist
lecture
the
government
did
not
think
of
their
wives
and
children
it
did
not
consider
that
the
men
kept
in
prison
were
not
the
only
ones
who
suffered
and
that
their
little
ones
cried
for
bread
bourgeois
justice
did
not
trouble
itself
about
these
innocent
ones
who
do
not
yet
know
what
society
is
it
is
no
fault
of
theirs
that
their
fathers
are
in
prison
they
only
want
to
eat
the
government
went
on
searching
private
houses
opening
private
letters
forbidding
lectures
and
meetings
and
practicing
the
most
infamous
oppressions
against
us
even
now
hundreds
of
anarchists
are
arrested
for
having
written
an
article
in
a
newspaper
or
for
having
expressed
an
opinion
in
public
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
are
representatives
of
bourgeois
society
if
you
want
my
head
take
it
but
do
not
believe
that
in
so
doing
you
will
stop
the
anarchist
propaganda
take
care
for
men
reap
what
they
have
sown
during
a
religious
procession
in
at
barcelona
a
bomb
was
thrown
immediately
three
hundred
men
and
women
were
arrested
some
were
anarchists
but
the
majority
were
trade
unionists
and
socialists
they
were
thrown
into
that
terrible
bastille
montjuich
and
subjected
to
most
horrible
tortures
after
a
number
had
been
killed
or
had
gone
insane
their
cases
were
taken
up
by
the
liberal
press
of
europe
resulting
in
the
release
of
a
few
survivors
the
man
primarily
responsible
for
this
revival
of
the
inquisition
was
canovas
del
castillo
prime
minister
of
spain
it
was
he
who
ordered
the
torturing
of
the
victims
their
flesh
burned
their
bones
crushed
their
tongues
cut
out
practiced
in
the
art
of
brutality
during
his
regime
in
cuba
canovas
remained
absolutely
deaf
to
the
appeals
and
protests
of
the
awakened
civilized
conscience
in
canovas
del
castillo
was
shot
to
death
by
a
young
italian
angiolillo
the
latter
was
an
editor
in
his
native
land
and
his
bold
utterances
soon
attracted
the
attention
of
the
authorities
persecution
began
and
angiolillo
fled
from
italy
to
spain
thence
to
france
and
belgium
finally
settling
in
england
while
there
he
found
employment
as
a
compositor
and
immediately
became
the
friend
of
all
his
colleagues
one
of
the
latter
thus
described
angiolillo
his
appearance
suggested
the
journalist
rather
than
the
disciple
of
guttenberg
his
delicate
hands
moreover
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
had
not
grown
up
at
the
with
his
handsome
frank
face
his
soft
dark
hair
his
alert
expression
he
looked
the
very
type
of
the
vivacious
southerner
angiolillo
spoke
italian
spanish
and
french
but
no
english
the
little
french
i
knew
was
not
sufficient
to
carry
on
a
prolonged
conversation
however
angiolillo
soon
began
to
acquire
the
english
idiom
he
learned
rapidly
playfully
and
it
was
not
long
until
he
became
very
popular
with
his
fellow
compositors
his
distinguished
and
yet
modest
manner
and
his
consideration
towards
his
colleagues
won
him
the
hearts
of
all
the
boys
angiolillo
soon
became
familiar
with
the
detailed
accounts
in
the
press
he
read
of
the
great
wave
of
human
sympathy
with
the
helpless
victims
at
montjuich
on
trafalgar
square
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
results
of
those
atrocities
when
the
few
spaniards
who
escaped
castillo
clutches
came
to
seek
asylum
in
england
there
at
the
great
meeting
these
men
opened
their
shirts
and
showed
the
horrible
scars
of
burned
flesh
angiolillo
saw
and
the
effect
surpassed
a
thousand
theories
the
impetus
was
beyond
words
beyond
arguments
beyond
himself
even
senor
antonio
canovas
del
castillo
prime
minister
of
spain
sojourned
at
santa
agueda
as
usual
in
such
cases
all
strangers
were
kept
away
from
his
exalted
presence
one
exception
was
made
however
in
the
case
of
a
distinguished
looking
elegantly
dressed
italian
the
representative
it
was
understood
of
an
important
journal
the
distinguished
gentleman
was
angiolillo
senor
canovas
about
to
leave
his
house
stepped
on
the
veranda
suddenly
angiolillo
confronted
him
a
shot
rang
out
and
canovas
was
a
corpse
the
wife
of
the
prime
minister
rushed
upon
the
scene
murderer
murderer
she
cried
pointing
at
angiolillo
the
latter
bowed
pardon
madame
he
said
i
respect
you
as
a
lady
but
i
regret
that
you
were
the
wife
of
that
man
calmly
angiolillo
faced
death
death
in
its
most
terrible
form
for
the
man
whose
soul
was
as
a
child
he
was
garroted
his
body
lay
till
the
day
hid
in
twilight
and
the
people
came
and
pointing
the
finger
of
terror
and
fear
they
said
there
the
criminal
the
cruel
murderer
how
stupid
how
cruel
is
ignorance
it
misunderstands
always
condemns
always
a
remarkable
parallel
to
the
case
of
angiolillo
is
to
be
found
in
the
act
of
gaetano
bresci
whose
attentat
upon
king
umberto
made
an
american
city
famous
bresci
came
to
this
country
this
land
of
opportunity
where
one
has
but
to
try
to
meet
with
golden
success
yes
he
too
would
try
to
succeed
he
would
work
hard
and
faithfully
work
had
no
terrors
for
him
if
it
would
only
help
him
to
independence
manhood
thus
full
of
hope
and
enthusiasm
he
settled
in
paterson
new
jersey
and
there
found
a
lucrative
job
at
six
dollars
per
week
in
one
of
the
weaving
mills
of
the
town
six
whole
dollars
per
week
was
no
doubt
a
fortune
for
italy
but
not
enough
to
breathe
on
in
the
new
country
he
loved
his
little
home
he
was
a
good
husband
and
devoted
father
to
his
bambina
bianca
whom
he
adored
he
worked
and
worked
for
a
number
of
years
he
actually
managed
to
save
one
hundred
dollars
out
of
his
six
dollars
per
week
bresci
had
an
ideal
foolish
i
know
for
a
workingman
to
have
an
ideal
the
anarchist
paper
published
in
paterson
la
questione
sociale
every
week
though
tired
from
work
he
would
help
to
set
up
the
paper
until
later
hours
he
would
assist
and
when
the
little
pioneer
had
exhausted
all
resources
and
his
comrades
were
in
despair
bresci
brought
cheer
and
hope
one
hundred
dollars
the
entire
savings
of
years
that
would
keep
the
paper
afloat
in
his
native
land
people
were
starving
the
crops
had
been
poor
and
the
peasants
saw
themselves
face
to
face
with
famine
they
appealed
to
their
good
king
umberto
he
would
help
and
he
did
the
wives
of
the
peasants
who
had
gone
to
the
palace
of
the
king
held
up
in
mute
silence
their
emaciated
infants
surely
that
would
move
him
and
then
the
soldiers
fired
and
killed
those
poor
fools
bresci
at
work
in
the
weaving
mill
at
paterson
read
of
the
horrible
massacre
his
mental
eye
beheld
the
defenceless
women
and
innocent
infants
of
his
native
land
slaughtered
right
before
the
good
king
his
soul
recoiled
in
horror
at
night
he
heard
the
groans
of
the
wounded
some
may
have
been
his
comrades
his
own
flesh
why
why
these
foul
murders
the
little
meeting
of
the
italian
anarchist
group
in
paterson
ended
almost
in
a
fight
bresci
had
demanded
his
hundred
dollars
his
comrades
begged
implored
him
to
give
them
a
respite
the
paper
would
go
down
if
they
were
to
return
him
his
loan
but
bresci
insisted
on
its
return
how
cruel
and
stupid
is
ignorance
bresci
got
the
money
but
lost
the
good
will
the
confidence
of
his
comrades
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
one
whose
greed
was
greater
than
his
ideals
on
the
of
july
king
umberto
was
shot
at
monzo
the
young
italian
weaver
of
paterson
gaetano
bresci
had
taken
the
life
of
the
good
king
paterson
was
placed
under
police
surveillance
everyone
known
as
an
anarchist
hounded
and
persecuted
and
the
act
of
bresci
ascribed
to
the
teachings
of
anarchism
as
if
the
teachings
of
anarchism
in
its
extremest
form
could
equal
the
force
of
those
slain
women
and
infants
who
had
pilgrimed
to
the
king
for
aid
as
if
any
spoken
word
ever
so
eloquent
could
burn
into
a
human
soul
with
such
white
heat
as
the
life
blood
trickling
drop
by
drop
from
those
dying
forms
the
ordinary
man
is
rarely
moved
either
by
word
or
deed
and
those
whose
social
kinship
is
the
greatest
living
force
need
no
appeal
to
respond
even
as
does
steel
to
the
magnet
to
the
wrongs
and
horrors
of
society
if
a
social
theory
is
a
strong
factor
inducing
acts
of
political
violence
how
are
we
to
account
for
the
recent
violent
outbreaks
in
india
where
anarchism
has
hardly
been
born
more
than
any
other
old
philosophy
hindu
teachings
have
exalted
passive
resistance
the
drifting
of
life
the
nirvana
as
the
highest
spiritual
ideal
yet
the
social
unrest
in
india
is
daily
growing
and
has
only
recently
resulted
in
an
act
of
political
violence
the
killing
of
sir
curzon
wyllie
by
the
hindu
madar
sol
dhingra
if
such
a
phenomenon
can
occur
in
a
country
socially
and
individually
permeated
for
centuries
with
the
spirit
of
passivity
can
one
question
the
tremendous
revolutionizing
effect
on
human
character
exerted
by
great
social
iniquities
can
one
doubt
the
logic
the
justice
of
these
words
repression
tyranny
and
indiscriminate
punishment
of
innocent
men
have
been
the
watchwords
of
the
government
of
the
alien
domination
in
india
ever
since
we
began
the
commercial
boycott
of
english
goods
the
tiger
qualities
of
the
british
are
much
in
evidence
now
in
india
they
think
that
by
the
strength
of
the
sword
they
will
keep
down
india
it
is
this
arrogance
that
has
brought
about
the
bomb
and
the
more
they
tyrannize
over
a
helpless
and
unarmed
people
the
more
terrorism
will
grow
we
may
deprecate
terrorism
as
outlandish
and
foreign
to
our
culture
but
it
is
inevitable
as
long
as
this
tyranny
continues
for
it
is
not
the
terrorists
that
are
to
be
blamed
but
the
tyrants
who
are
responsible
for
it
it
is
the
only
resource
for
a
helpless
and
unarmed
people
when
brought
to
the
verge
of
despair
it
is
never
criminal
on
their
part
the
crime
lies
with
the
tyrant
even
conservative
scientists
are
beginning
to
realize
that
heredity
is
not
the
sole
factor
moulding
human
character
climate
food
occupation
nay
color
light
and
sound
must
be
considered
in
the
study
of
human
psychology
if
that
be
true
how
much
more
correct
is
the
contention
that
great
social
abuses
will
and
must
influence
different
minds
and
temperaments
in
a
different
way
and
how
utterly
fallacious
the
stereotyped
notion
that
the
teachings
of
anarchism
or
certain
exponents
of
these
teachings
are
responsible
for
the
acts
of
political
violence
anarchism
more
than
any
other
social
theory
values
human
life
above
things
all
anarchists
agree
with
tolstoy
in
this
fundamental
truth
if
the
production
of
any
commodity
necessitates
the
sacrifice
of
human
life
society
should
do
without
that
commodity
but
it
can
not
do
without
that
life
that
however
nowise
indicates
that
anarchism
teaches
submission
how
can
it
when
it
knows
that
all
suffering
all
misery
all
ills
result
from
the
evil
of
submission
has
not
some
american
ancestor
said
many
years
ago
that
resistance
to
tyranny
is
obedience
to
god
and
he
was
not
an
anarchist
even
i
would
say
that
resistance
to
tyranny
is
man
highest
ideal
so
long
as
tyranny
exists
in
whatever
form
man
deepest
aspiration
must
resist
it
as
inevitably
as
man
must
breathe
compared
with
the
wholesale
violence
of
capital
and
government
political
acts
of
violence
are
but
a
drop
in
the
ocean
that
so
few
resist
is
the
strongest
proof
how
terrible
must
be
the
conflict
between
their
souls
and
unbearable
social
iniquities
high
strung
like
a
violin
string
they
weep
and
moan
for
life
so
relentless
so
cruel
so
terribly
inhuman
in
a
desperate
moment
the
string
breaks
untuned
ears
hear
nothing
but
discord
but
those
who
feel
the
agonized
cry
understand
its
harmony
they
hear
in
it
the
fulfillment
of
the
most
compelling
moment
of
human
nature
such
is
the
psychology
of
political
violence
a
revolutionist
committing
an
act
of
political
violence
paris
and
the
social
revolution
from
a
pamphlet
issued
by
the
freedom
group
of
london
the
free
hindustan
prisons
a
social
crime
and
failure
in
feodor
dostoyevsky
wrote
on
the
wall
of
his
prison
cell
the
following
story
of
the
priest
and
the
devil
you
little
fat
father
the
devil
said
to
the
priest
made
you
lie
so
to
those
poor
misled
people
what
tortures
of
hell
did
you
depict
do
you
know
they
are
already
suffering
the
tortures
of
hell
in
their
earthly
lives
do
you
know
that
you
and
the
authorities
of
the
state
are
my
representatives
on
earth
it
is
you
that
make
them
suffer
the
pains
of
hell
with
which
you
threaten
them
do
you
know
this
well
then
come
with
me
the
devil
grabbed
the
priest
by
the
collar
lifted
him
high
in
the
air
and
carried
him
to
a
factory
to
an
iron
foundry
he
saw
the
workmen
there
running
and
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
toiling
in
the
scorching
heat
very
soon
the
thick
heavy
air
and
the
heat
are
too
much
for
the
priest
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
pleads
with
the
devil
me
go
let
me
leave
this
hell
my
dear
friend
i
must
show
you
many
more
places
the
devil
gets
hold
of
him
again
and
drags
him
off
to
a
farm
there
he
sees
workmen
threshing
the
grain
the
dust
and
heat
are
insufferable
the
overseer
carries
a
knout
and
unmercifully
beats
anyone
who
falls
to
the
ground
overcome
by
hard
toil
or
hunger
next
the
priest
is
taken
to
the
huts
where
these
same
workers
live
with
their
families
dirty
cold
smoky
holes
the
devil
grins
he
points
out
the
poverty
and
hardships
which
are
at
home
here
is
this
enough
he
asks
and
it
seems
as
if
even
he
the
devil
pities
the
people
the
pious
servant
of
god
can
hardly
bear
it
with
uplifted
hands
he
begs
me
go
away
from
here
yes
yes
this
is
hell
on
earth
then
you
see
and
you
still
promise
them
another
hell
you
torment
them
torture
them
to
death
mentally
when
they
are
already
all
but
dead
physically
come
on
i
will
show
you
one
more
hell
one
more
the
very
worst
he
took
him
to
a
prison
and
showed
him
a
dungeon
with
its
foul
air
and
the
many
human
forms
robbed
of
all
health
and
energy
lying
on
the
floor
covered
with
vermin
that
were
devouring
their
poor
naked
emaciated
bodies
off
your
silken
clothes
said
the
devil
to
the
priest
on
your
ankles
heavy
chains
such
as
these
unfortunates
wear
lie
down
on
the
cold
and
filthy
floor
and
then
talk
to
them
about
a
hell
that
still
awaits
them
no
answered
the
priest
can
not
think
of
anything
more
dreadful
than
this
i
entreat
you
let
me
go
away
from
here
this
is
hell
there
can
be
no
worse
hell
than
this
did
you
not
know
it
did
you
not
know
that
these
men
and
women
whom
you
are
frightening
with
the
picture
of
a
hell
hereafter
did
you
not
know
that
they
are
in
hell
right
here
before
they
die
this
was
written
fifty
years
ago
in
dark
russia
on
the
wall
of
one
of
the
most
horrible
prisons
yet
who
can
deny
that
the
same
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
present
time
even
to
american
prisons
with
all
our
boasted
reforms
our
great
social
changes
and
our
discoveries
human
beings
continue
to
be
sent
to
the
worst
of
hells
wherein
they
are
outraged
degraded
and
tortured
that
society
may
be
protected
from
the
phantoms
of
its
own
making
prison
a
social
protection
what
monstrous
mind
ever
conceived
such
an
idea
just
as
well
say
that
health
can
be
promoted
by
a
widespread
contagion
after
eighteen
months
of
horror
in
an
english
prison
oscar
wilde
gave
to
the
world
his
great
masterpiece
the
ballad
of
reading
goal
the
vilest
deeds
like
poison
weeds
bloom
well
in
prison
air
it
is
only
what
is
good
in
man
that
wastes
and
withers
there
pale
anguish
keeps
the
heavy
gate
and
the
warder
is
despair
society
goes
on
perpetuating
this
poisonous
air
not
realizing
that
out
of
it
can
come
naught
but
the
most
poisonous
results
we
are
spending
at
the
present
per
day
per
year
to
maintain
prison
institutions
and
that
in
a
democratic
country
a
sum
almost
as
large
as
the
combined
output
of
wheat
valued
at
and
the
output
of
coal
valued
at
professor
bushnell
of
washington
estimates
the
cost
of
prisons
at
annually
and
frank
lydston
an
eminent
american
writer
on
crime
gives
annually
as
a
reasonable
figure
such
expenditure
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
vast
armies
of
human
beings
caged
up
like
wild
beasts
yet
crimes
are
on
the
increase
thus
we
learn
that
in
america
there
are
four
and
a
half
times
as
many
crimes
to
every
million
population
today
as
there
were
twenty
years
ago
the
most
horrible
aspect
is
that
our
national
crime
is
murder
not
robbery
embezzlement
or
rape
as
in
the
south
london
is
five
times
as
large
as
chicago
yet
there
are
one
hundred
and
eighteen
murders
annually
in
the
latter
city
while
only
twenty
in
london
nor
is
chicago
the
leading
city
in
crime
since
it
is
only
seventh
on
the
list
which
is
headed
by
four
southern
cities
and
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
in
view
of
such
a
terrible
condition
of
affairs
it
seems
ridiculous
to
prate
of
the
protection
society
derives
from
its
prisons
the
average
mind
is
slow
in
grasping
a
truth
but
when
the
most
thoroughly
organized
centralized
institution
maintained
at
an
excessive
national
expense
has
proven
a
complete
social
failure
the
dullest
must
begin
to
question
its
right
to
exist
the
time
is
past
when
we
can
be
content
with
our
social
fabric
merely
because
it
is
ordained
by
divine
right
or
by
the
majesty
of
the
law
the
widespread
prison
investigations
agitation
and
education
during
the
last
few
years
are
conclusive
proof
that
men
are
learning
to
dig
deep
into
the
very
bottom
of
society
down
to
the
causes
of
the
terrible
discrepancy
between
social
and
individual
life
why
then
are
prisons
a
social
crime
and
a
failure
to
answer
this
vital
question
it
behooves
us
to
seek
the
nature
and
cause
of
crimes
the
methods
employed
in
coping
with
them
and
the
effects
these
methods
produce
in
ridding
society
of
the
curse
and
horror
of
crimes
first
as
to
the
nature
of
crime
havelock
ellis
divides
crime
into
four
phases
the
political
the
passional
the
insane
and
the
occasional
he
says
that
the
political
criminal
is
the
victim
of
an
attempt
of
a
more
or
less
despotic
government
to
preserve
its
own
stability
he
is
not
necessarily
guilty
of
an
unsocial
offense
he
simply
tries
to
overturn
a
certain
political
order
which
may
itself
be
this
truth
is
recognized
all
over
the
world
except
in
america
where
the
foolish
notion
still
prevails
that
in
a
democracy
there
is
no
place
for
political
criminals
yet
john
brown
was
a
political
criminal
so
were
the
chicago
anarchists
so
is
every
striker
consequently
says
havelock
ellis
the
political
criminal
of
our
time
or
place
may
be
the
hero
martyr
saint
of
another
age
lombroso
calls
the
political
criminal
the
true
precursor
of
the
progressive
movement
of
humanity
the
criminal
by
passion
is
usually
a
man
of
wholesome
birth
and
honest
life
who
under
the
stress
of
some
great
unmerited
wrong
has
wrought
justice
for
himself
hugh
weir
in
the
menace
of
the
police
cites
the
case
of
jim
flaherty
a
criminal
by
passion
who
instead
of
being
saved
by
society
is
turned
into
a
drunkard
and
a
recidivist
with
a
ruined
and
family
as
the
result
a
more
pathetic
type
is
archie
the
victim
in
brand
whitlock
novel
the
turn
of
the
balance
the
greatest
american
expose
of
crime
in
the
making
archie
even
more
than
flaherty
was
driven
to
crime
and
death
by
the
cruel
inhumanity
of
his
surroundings
and
by
the
unscrupulous
hounding
of
the
machinery
of
the
law
archie
and
flaherty
are
but
the
types
of
many
thousands
demonstrating
how
the
legal
aspects
of
crime
and
the
methods
of
dealing
with
it
help
to
create
the
disease
which
is
undermining
our
entire
social
life
the
insane
criminal
really
can
no
more
be
considered
a
criminal
than
a
child
since
he
is
mentally
in
the
same
condition
as
an
infant
or
an
animal
the
law
already
recognizes
that
but
only
in
rare
cases
of
a
very
flagrant
nature
or
when
the
culprit
wealth
permits
the
luxury
of
criminal
insanity
it
has
become
quite
fashionable
to
be
the
victim
of
paranoia
but
on
the
whole
the
sovereignty
of
justice
still
continues
to
punish
criminally
insane
with
the
whole
severity
of
its
power
thus
ellis
quotes
from
richter
statistics
showing
that
in
germany
one
hundred
and
six
madmen
out
of
one
hundred
and
criminal
insane
were
condemned
to
severe
punishment
the
occasional
criminal
represents
by
far
the
largest
class
of
our
prison
population
hence
is
the
greatest
menace
to
social
what
is
the
cause
that
compels
a
vast
army
of
the
human
family
to
take
to
crime
to
prefer
the
hideous
life
within
prison
walls
to
the
life
outside
certainly
that
cause
must
be
an
iron
master
who
leaves
its
victims
no
avenue
of
escape
for
the
most
depraved
human
being
loves
liberty
this
terrific
force
is
conditioned
in
our
cruel
social
and
economic
arrangement
i
do
not
mean
to
deny
the
biologic
physiologic
or
psychologic
factors
in
creating
crime
but
there
is
hardly
an
advanced
criminologist
who
will
not
concede
that
the
social
and
economic
influences
are
the
most
relentless
the
most
poisonous
germs
of
crime
granted
even
that
there
are
innate
criminal
tendencies
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
these
tendencies
find
rich
nutrition
in
our
social
environment
there
is
close
relation
says
havelock
ellis
between
crimes
against
the
person
and
the
price
of
alcohol
between
crimes
against
property
and
the
price
of
wheat
he
quotes
quetelet
and
lacassagne
the
former
looking
upon
society
as
the
preparer
of
crime
and
the
criminals
as
instruments
that
execute
them
the
latter
find
that
the
social
environment
is
the
cultivation
medium
of
criminality
that
the
criminal
is
the
microbe
an
element
which
only
becomes
important
when
it
finds
the
medium
which
causes
it
to
ferment
every
society
has
the
criminals
it
deserves
the
most
prosperous
industrial
period
makes
it
impossible
for
the
worker
to
earn
enough
to
keep
up
health
and
vigor
and
as
prosperity
is
at
best
an
imaginary
condition
thousands
of
people
are
constantly
added
to
the
host
of
the
unemployed
from
east
to
west
from
south
to
north
this
vast
army
tramps
in
search
of
work
or
food
and
all
they
find
is
the
workhouse
or
the
slums
those
who
have
a
spark
of
left
prefer
open
defiance
prefer
crime
to
the
emaciated
degraded
position
of
poverty
edward
carpenter
estimates
that
of
indictable
crimes
consist
in
some
violation
of
property
rights
but
that
is
too
low
a
figure
a
thorough
investigation
would
prove
that
nine
crimes
out
of
ten
could
be
traced
directly
or
indirectly
to
our
economic
and
social
iniquities
to
our
system
of
remorseless
exploitation
and
robbery
there
is
no
criminal
so
stupid
but
recognizes
this
terrible
fact
though
he
may
not
be
able
to
account
for
it
a
collection
of
criminal
philosophy
which
havelock
ellis
lombroso
and
other
eminent
men
have
compiled
shows
that
the
criminal
feels
only
too
keenly
that
it
is
society
that
drives
him
to
crime
a
milanese
thief
said
to
lombroso

an

said
to

the
laws
of
society
are
framed
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
wealth
of
the
world
to
power
and
calculation
thereby
depriving
the
larger
portion
of
mankind
of
its
rights
and
chances
why
should
they
punish

taking
by
somewhat
similar

religion

patriotism
is
the
stupid
worship
of
the
world
for
which
the
and
the
peace
of
the
inhabitants
were
sacrificed
by
those
who
profit
by
it
while
the
laws
of
the
land
in
restraining
natural
desires
were
waging
war
on
the
manifest
spirit
of
the
law
of
our
beings
compared
with
this
he
concluded
thieving
is
an
honorable
pursuit
verily
there
is
greater
truth
in
this
philosophy
than
in
all
the
books
of
society
the
economic
political
moral
and
physical
factors
being
the
microbes
of
crime
how
does
society
meet
the
situation
the
methods
of
coping
with
crime
have
no
doubt
undergone
several
changes
but
mainly
in
a
theoretic
sense
in
practice
society
has
retained
the
primitive
motive
in
dealing
with
the
offender
that
is
revenge
it
has
also
adopted
the
theologic
idea
namely
punishment
while
the
legal
and
civilized
methods
consist
of
deterrence
or
terror
and
reform
we
shall
presently
see
that
all
four
modes
have
failed
utterly
and
that
we
are
today
no
nearer
a
solution
than
in
the
dark
ages
the
natural
impulse
of
the
primitive
man
to
strike
back
to
avenge
a
wrong
is
out
of
date
instead
the
civilized
man
stripped
of
courage
and
daring
has
delegated
to
an
organized
machinery
the
duty
of
avenging
his
wrongs
in
the
foolish
belief
that
the
state
is
justified
in
doing
what
he
no
longer
has
the
manhood
or
consistency
to
do
the
is
a
reasoning
thing
it
would
not
stoop
to
primitive
instincts
its
mission
is
of
a
higher
nature
true
it
is
still
steeped
in
the
theologic
muddle
which
proclaims
punishment
as
a
means
of
purification
or
the
vicarious
atonement
of
sin
but
legally
and
socially
the
statute
exercises
punishment
not
merely
as
an
infliction
of
pain
upon
the
offender
but
also
for
its
terrifying
effect
upon
others
what
is
the
real
basis
of
punishment
however
the
notion
of
a
free
will
the
idea
that
man
is
at
all
times
a
free
agent
for
good
or
evil
if
he
chooses
the
latter
he
must
be
made
to
pay
the
price
although
this
theory
has
long
been
exploded
and
thrown
upon
the
dustheap
it
continues
to
be
applied
daily
by
the
entire
machinery
of
government
turning
it
into
the
most
cruel
and
brutal
tormentor
of
human
life
the
only
reason
for
its
continuance
is
the
still
more
cruel
notion
that
the
greater
the
terror
punishment
spreads
the
more
certain
its
preventative
effect
society
is
using
the
most
drastic
methods
in
dealing
with
the
social
offender
why
do
they
not
deter
although
in
america
a
man
is
supposed
to
be
considered
innocent
until
proven
guilty
the
instruments
of
law
the
police
carry
on
a
reign
of
terror
making
indiscriminate
arrests
beating
clubbing
bullying
people
using
the
barbarous
method
of
the
third
degree
subjecting
their
unfortunate
victims
to
the
foul
air
of
the
station
house
and
the
still
fouler
language
of
its
guardians
yet
crimes
are
rapidly
multiplying
and
society
is
paying
the
price
on
the
other
hand
it
is
an
open
secret
that
when
the
unfortunate
citizen
has
been
given
the
full
mercy
of
the
law
and
for
the
sake
of
safety
is
hidden
in
the
worst
of
hells
his
real
calvary
begins
robbed
of
his
rights
as
a
human
being
degraded
to
a
mere
automaton
without
will
or
feeling
dependent
entirely
upon
the
mercy
of
brutal
keepers
he
daily
goes
through
a
process
of
dehumanization
compared
with
which
savage
revenge
was
mere
child
play
there
is
not
a
single
penal
institution
or
reformatory
in
the
united
states
where
men
are
not
tortured
to
be
made
good
by
means
of
the
blackjack
the
club
the
straightjacket
the
the
humming
bird
an
electrical
contrivance
run
along
the
human
body
the
solitary
the
bullring
and
starvation
diet
in
these
institutions
his
will
is
broken
his
soul
degraded
his
spirit
subdued
by
the
deadly
monotony
and
routine
of
prison
life
in
ohio
illinois
pennsylvania
missouri
and
in
the
south
these
horrors
have
become
so
flagrant
as
to
reach
the
outside
world
while
in
most
other
prisons
the
same
christian
methods
still
prevail
but
prison
walls
rarely
allow
the
agonized
shrieks
of
the
victims
to
escape
prison
walls
are
thick
they
dull
the
sound
society
might
with
greater
immunity
abolish
all
prisons
at
once
than
to
hope
for
protection
from
these
twentieth
century
chambers
of
horrors
year
after
year
the
gates
of
prison
hells
return
to
the
world
an
emaciated
deformed
willless
crew
of
humanity
with
the
cain
mark
on
their
foreheads
their
hopes
crushed
all
their
natural
inclinations
thwarted
with
nothing
but
hunger
and
inhumanity
to
greet
them
these
victims
soon
sink
back
into
crime
as
the
only
possibility
of
existence
it
is
not
at
all
an
unusual
thing
to
find
men
and
women
who
have
spent
half
their
lives
nay
almost
their
entire
existence
in
prison
i
know
a
woman
on
island
who
had
been
in
and
out
times
and
through
a
friend
i
learn
that
a
young
boy
of
seventeen
whom
he
had
nursed
and
cared
for
in
the
pittsburg
penitentiary
had
never
known
the
meaning
of
liberty
from
the
reformatory
to
the
penitentiary
had
been
the
path
of
this
boy
life
until
broken
in
body
he
died
a
victim
of
social
revenge
these
personal
experiences
are
substantiated
by
extensive
data
giving
overwhelming
proof
of
the
utter
futility
of
prisons
as
a
means
of
deterrence
or
reform
persons
are
now
working
for
a
new
departure
in
the
prison
question
reclamation
to
restore
once
more
to
the
prisoner
the
possibility
of
becoming
a
human
being
commendable
as
this
is
i
fear
it
is
impossible
to
hope
for
good
results
from
pouring
good
wine
into
a
musty
bottle
nothing
short
of
a
complete
reconstruction
of
society
will
deliver
mankind
from
the
cancer
of
crime
still
if
the
dull
edge
of
our
social
conscience
would
be
sharpened
the
penal
institutions
might
be
given
a
new
coat
of
varnish
but
the
first
step
to
be
taken
is
the
renovation
of
the
social
consciousness
which
is
in
a
rather
dilapidated
condition
it
is
sadly
in
need
to
be
awakened
to
the
fact
that
crime
is
a
question
of
degree
that
we
all
have
the
rudiments
of
crime
in
us
more
or
less
according
to
our
mental
physical
and
social
environment
and
that
the
individual
criminal
is
merely
a
reflex
of
the
tendencies
of
the
aggregate
with
the
social
consciousness
awakened
the
average
individual
may
learn
to
refuse
the
honor
of
being
the
bloodhound
of
the
law
he
may
cease
to
persecute
despise
and
mistrust
the
social
offender
and
give
him
a
chance
to
live
and
breathe
among
his
fellows
institutions
are
of
course
harder
to
reach
they
are
cold
impenetrable
and
cruel
still
with
the
social
consciousness
quickened
it
might
be
possible
to
free
the
prison
victims
from
the
brutality
of
prison
officials
guards
and
keepers
public
opinion
is
a
powerful
weapon
keepers
of
human
prey
even
are
afraid
of
it
they
may
be
taught
a
little
humanity
especially
if
they
realize
that
their
jobs
depend
upon
it
but
the
most
important
step
is
to
demand
for
the
prisoner
the
right
to
work
while
in
prison
with
some
monetary
recompense
that
would
enable
him
to
lay
aside
a
little
for
the
day
of
his
release
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
it
is
almost
ridiculous
to
hope
much
from
present
society
when
we
consider
that
workingmen
wage
slaves
themselves
object
to
convict
labor
i
shall
not
go
into
the
cruelty
of
this
objection
but
merely
consider
the
impracticability
of
it
to
begin
with
the
opposition
so
far
raised
by
organized
labor
has
been
directed
against
windmills
prisoners
have
always
worked
only
the
state
has
been
their
exploiter
even
as
the
individual
employer
has
been
the
robber
of
organized
labor
the
states
have
either
set
the
convicts
to
work
for
the
government
or
they
have
farmed
convict
labor
to
private
individuals
of
the
states
pursue
the
latter
plan
the
federal
government
and
seventeen
states
have
discarded
it
as
have
the
leading
nations
of
europe
since
it
leads
to
hideous
overworking
and
abuse
of
prisoners
and
to
endless
graft
rhode
island
the
state
dominated
by
aldrich
offers
perhaps
the
worst
example
under
a
contract
dated
july
and
renewable
for
five
years
more
at
the
option
of
private
contractors
the
labor
of
the
inmates
of
the
rhode
island
penitentiary
and
the
providence
county
jail
is
sold
to
the
mfg
at
the
rate
of
a
trifle
less
than
cents
a
day
per
man
this
company
is
really
a
gigantic
prison
labor
trust
for
it
also
leases
the
convict
labor
of
connecticut
michigan
indiana
nebraska
and
south
dakota
penitentiaries
and
the
reformatories
of
new
jersey
indiana
illinois
and
wisconsin
eleven
establishments
in
all
the
enormity
of
the
graft
under
the
rhode
island
contract
may
be
estimated
from
the
fact
that
this
same
company
pays
cents
a
day
in
nebraska
for
the
convict
labor
and
that
tennessee
for
example
gets
a
day
for
a
convict
work
from
the
hardware
missouri
gets
cents
a
day
from
the
star
overall
mfg
west
virginia
cents
a
day
from
the
kraft
mfg
and
maryland
cents
a
day
from
oppenheim
oberndorf
shirt
manufacturers
the
very
difference
in
prices
points
to
enormous
graft
for
example
the
mfg
manufactures
shirts
the
cost
of
free
labor
being
not
less
than
per
dozen
while
it
pays
rhode
island
thirty
cents
a
dozen
furthermore
the
state
charges
this
trust
no
rent
for
the
use
of
its
huge
factory
charges
nothing
for
power
heat
light
or
even
drainage
and
exacts
no
taxes
what
graft
it
is
estimated
that
more
than
twelve
million
dollars
worth
of
workingmen
shirts
and
overalls
is
produced
annually
in
this
country
by
prison
labor
it
is
a
woman
industry
and
the
first
reflection
that
arises
is
that
an
immense
amount
of
free
female
labor
is
thus
displaced
the
second
consideration
is
that
male
convicts
who
should
be
learning
trades
that
would
give
them
some
chance
of
being
after
their
release
are
kept
at
this
work
at
which
they
can
not
possibly
make
a
dollar
this
is
the
more
serious
when
we
consider
that
much
of
this
labor
is
done
in
reformatories
which
so
loudly
profess
to
be
training
their
inmates
to
become
useful
citizens
the
third
and
most
important
consideration
is
that
the
enormous
profits
thus
wrung
from
convict
labor
are
a
constant
incentive
to
the
contractors
to
exact
from
their
unhappy
victims
tasks
altogether
beyond
their
strength
and
to
punish
them
cruelly
when
their
work
does
not
come
up
to
the
excessive
demands
made
another
word
on
the
condemnation
of
convicts
to
tasks
at
which
they
can
not
hope
to
make
a
living
after
release
indiana
for
example
is
a
state
that
has
made
a
great
splurge
over
being
in
the
front
rank
of
modern
penological
improvements
yet
according
to
the
report
rendered
in
by
the
training
school
of
its
reformatory
were
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
chains
in
that
of
shirts
and
in
the
foundry
a
total
of
in
three
occupations
but
at
this
reformatory
occupations
were
represented
by
the
inmates
of
which
were
connected
with
country
pursuits
indiana
like
other
states
professes
to
be
training
the
inmates
of
her
reformatory
to
occupations
by
which
they
will
be
able
to
make
their
living
when
released
she
actually
sets
them
to
work
making
chains
shirts
and
brooms
the
latter
for
the
benefit
of
the
louisville
fancy
grocery
broom
making
is
a
trade
largely
monopolized
by
the
blind
shirt
making
is
done
by
women
and
there
is
only
one
free
chain
factory
in
the
state
and
at
that
a
released
convict
can
not
hope
to
get
employment
the
whole
thing
is
a
cruel
farce
if
then
the
states
can
be
instrumental
in
robbing
their
helpless
victims
of
such
tremendous
profits
is
it
not
high
time
for
organized
labor
to
stop
its
idle
howl
and
to
insist
on
decent
remuneration
for
the
convict
even
as
labor
organizations
claim
for
themselves
in
that
way
workingmen
would
kill
the
germ
which
makes
of
the
prisoner
an
enemy
to
the
interests
of
labor
i
have
said
elsewhere
that
thousands
of
convicts
incompetent
and
without
a
trade
without
means
of
subsistence
are
yearly
turned
back
into
the
social
fold
these
men
and
women
must
live
for
even
an
has
needs
prison
life
has
made
them
beings
and
the
rigidly
closed
doors
that
meet
them
on
their
release
are
not
likely
to
decrease
their
bitterness
the
inevitable
result
is
that
they
form
a
favorable
nucleus
out
of
which
scabs
blacklegs
detectives
and
policemen
are
drawn
only
too
willing
to
do
the
master
bidding
thus
organized
labor
by
its
foolish
opposition
to
work
in
prison
defeats
its
own
ends
it
helps
to
create
poisonous
fumes
that
stifle
every
attempt
for
economic
betterment
if
the
workingman
wants
to
avoid
these
effects
he
should
insist
on
the
right
of
the
convict
to
work
he
should
meet
him
as
a
brother
take
him
into
his
organization
and
with
his
aid
turn
against
the
system
which
grinds
them
both
last
but
not
least
is
the
growing
realization
of
the
barbarity
and
the
inadequacy
of
the
definite
sentence
those
who
believe
in
and
earnestly
aim
at
a
change
are
fast
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
man
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
good
and
how
is
he
to
do
it
with
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
years
imprisonment
before
him
the
hope
of
liberty
and
of
opportunity
is
the
only
incentive
to
life
especially
the
prisoner
life
society
has
sinned
so
long
against
him
it
ought
at
least
to
leave
him
that
i
am
not
very
sanguine
that
it
will
or
that
any
real
change
in
that
direction
can
take
place
until
the
conditions
that
breed
both
the
prisoner
and
the
jailer
will
be
forever
abolished
out
of
his
mouth
a
red
red
rose
out
of
his
heart
a
white
for
who
can
say
by
what
strange
way
christ
brings
his
will
to
light

barren

patriotism
a
menace
to
liberty
what
is
patriotism
is
it
love
of
one
birthplace
the
place
of
childhood
recollections
and
hopes
dreams
and
aspirations
is
it
the
place
where
in
childlike
naivety
we
would
watch
the
fleeting
clouds
and
wonder
why
we
too
could
not
run
so
swiftly
the
place
where
we
would
count
the
milliard
glittering
stars
lest
each
one
an
eye
should
be
piercing
the
very
depths
of
our
little
souls
is
it
the
place
where
we
would
listen
to
the
music
of
the
birds
and
long
to
have
wings
to
fly
even
as
they
to
distant
lands
or
the
place
where
we
would
sit
at
mother
knee
enraptured
by
wonderful
tales
of
great
deeds
and
conquests
in
short
is
it
love
for
the
spot
every
inch
representing
dear
and
precious
recollections
of
a
happy
joyous
and
playful
childhood
if
that
were
patriotism
few
american
men
of
today
could
be
called
upon
to
be
patriotic
since
the
place
of
play
has
been
turned
into
factory
mill
and
mine
while
deafening
sounds
of
machinery
have
replaced
the
music
of
the
birds
nor
can
we
longer
hear
the
tales
of
great
deeds
for
the
stories
our
mothers
tell
today
are
but
those
of
sorrow
tears
and
grief
what
then
is
patriotism
patriotism
sir
is
the
last
resort
of
scoundrels
said
johnson
leo
tolstoy
the
greatest
of
our
times
defines
patriotism
as
the
principle
that
will
justify
the
training
of
wholesale
murderers
a
trade
that
requires
better
equipment
for
the
exercise
of
than
the
making
of
such
necessities
of
life
as
shoes
clothing
and
houses
a
trade
that
guarantees
better
returns
and
greater
glory
than
that
of
the
average
workingman
gustave
herve
another
great
justly
calls
patriotism
a
superstition
one
far
more
injurious
brutal
and
inhumane
than
religion
the
superstition
of
religion
originated
in
man
inability
to
explain
natural
phenomena
that
is
when
primitive
man
heard
thunder
or
saw
the
lightning
he
could
not
account
for
either
and
therefore
concluded
that
back
of
them
must
be
a
force
greater
than
himself
similarly
he
saw
a
supernatural
force
in
the
rain
and
in
the
various
other
changes
in
nature
patriotism
on
the
other
hand
is
a
superstition
artificially
created
and
maintained
through
a
network
of
lies
and
falsehoods
a
superstition
that
robs
man
of
his
and
dignity
and
increases
his
arrogance
and
conceit
indeed
conceit
arrogance
and
egotism
are
the
essentials
of
patriotism
let
me
illustrate
patriotism
assumes
that
our
globe
is
divided
into
little
spots
each
one
surrounded
by
an
iron
gate
those
who
have
had
the
fortune
of
being
born
on
some
particular
spot
consider
themselves
better
nobler
grander
more
intelligent
than
the
living
beings
inhabiting
any
other
spot
it
is
therefore
the
duty
of
everyone
living
on
that
chosen
spot
to
fight
kill
and
die
in
the
attempt
to
impose
his
superiority
upon
all
the
others
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
spots
reason
in
like
manner
of
course
with
the
result
that
from
early
infancy
the
mind
of
the
child
is
poisoned
with
stories
about
the
germans
the
french
the
italians
russians
etc
when
the
child
has
reached
manhood
he
is
thoroughly
saturated
with
the
belief
that
he
is
chosen
by
the
lord
himself
to
defend
his
country
against
the
attack
or
invasion
of
any
foreigner
it
is
for
that
purpose
that
we
are
clamoring
for
a
greater
army
and
navy
more
battleships
and
ammunition
it
is
for
that
purpose
that
america
has
within
a
short
time
spent
four
hundred
million
dollars
just
think
of
it
four
hundred
million
dollars
taken
from
the
produce
of
the
people
for
surely
it
is
not
the
rich
who
contribute
to
patriotism
they
are
cosmopolitans
perfectly
at
home
in
every
land
we
in
america
know
well
the
truth
of
this
are
not
our
rich
americans
frenchmen
in
france
germans
in
germany
or
englishmen
in
england
and
do
they
not
squander
with
cosmopolitan
grace
fortunes
coined
by
american
factory
children
and
cotton
slaves
yes
theirs
is
the
patriotism
that
will
make
it
possible
to
send
messages
of
condolence
to
a
despot
like
the
russian
tsar
when
any
mishap
befalls
him
as
president
roosevelt
did
in
the
name
of
his
people
when
sergius
was
punished
by
the
russian
revolutionists
it
is
a
patriotism
that
will
assist
the
diaz
in
destroying
thousands
of
lives
in
mexico
or
that
will
even
aid
in
arresting
mexican
revolutionists
on
american
soil
and
keep
them
incarcerated
in
american
prisons
without
the
slightest
cause
or
reason
but
then
patriotism
is
not
for
those
who
represent
wealth
and
power
it
is
good
enough
for
the
people
it
reminds
one
of
the
historic
wisdom
of
frederic
the
great
the
bosom
friend
of
voltaire
who
said
religion
is
a
fraud
but
it
must
be
maintained
for
the
masses
that
patriotism
is
rather
a
costly
institution
no
one
will
doubt
after
considering
the
following
statistics
the
progressive
increase
of
the
expenditures
for
the
leading
armies
and
navies
of
the
world
during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
is
a
fact
of
such
gravity
as
to
startle
every
thoughtful
student
of
economic
problems
it
may
be
briefly
indicated
by
dividing
the
time
from
to
into
periods
and
noting
the
disbursements
of
several
great
nations
for
army
and
navy
purposes
during
the
first
and
last
of
those
periods
from
the
first
to
the
last
of
the
periods
noted
the
expenditures
of
great
britain
increased
from
to
those
of
france
from
to
those
of
germany
from
to
those
of
the
united
states
from
to
those
of
russia
from
to
those
of
italy
from
to
and
those
of
japan
from
to
the
military
expenditures
of
each
of
the
nations
mentioned
increased
in
each
of
the
periods
under
review
during
the
entire
interval
from
to
great
britain
outlay
for
her
army
increased
fourfold
that
of
the
united
states
was
tripled
was
doubled
that
of
germany
increased
per
that
of
france
about
per
and
that
of
japan
nearly
per
cent
if
we
compare
the
expenditures
of
these
nations
upon
their
armies
with
their
total
expenditures
for
all
the
years
ending
with
the
proportion
rose
as
follows
in
great
britain
from
per
cent
to
in
the
united
states
from
to
in
france
from
to
in
italy
from
to
in
japan
from
to
on
the
other
hand
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
proportion
in
germany
decreased
from
about
per
cent
to
the
decrease
being
due
to
the
enormous
increase
in
the
imperial
expenditures
for
other
purposes
the
fact
being
that
the
army
expenditures
for
the
period
of
were
higher
than
for
any
period
preceding
statistics
show
that
the
countries
in
which
army
expenditures
are
greatest
in
proportion
to
the
total
national
revenues
are
great
britain
the
united
states
japan
france
and
italy
in
the
order
named
the
showing
as
to
the
cost
of
great
navies
is
equally
impressive
during
the
years
ending
with
naval
expenditures
increased
approximately
as
follows
great
britain
per
cent
france
per
cent
germany
per
cent
the
united
states
per
cent
russia
per
cent
italy
per
cent
and
japan
per
cent
with
the
exception
of
great
britain
the
united
states
spends
more
for
naval
purposes
than
any
other
nation
and
this
expenditure
bears
also
a
larger
proportion
to
the
entire
national
disbursements
than
that
of
any
other
power
in
the
period
the
expenditure
for
the
united
states
navy
was
out
of
each
appropriated
for
all
national
purposes
the
amount
rose
to
for
the
next
period
to
for
the
next
to
for
the
next
and
to
for
it
is
morally
certain
that
the
outlay
for
the
current
period
of
five
years
will
show
a
still
further
increase
the
rising
cost
of
militarism
may
be
still
further
illustrated
by
computing
it
as
a
per
capita
tax
on
population
from
the
first
to
the
last
of
the
periods
taken
as
the
basis
for
the
comparisons
here
given
it
has
risen
as
follows
in
great
britain
from
to
in
france
from
to
in
germany
from
to
in
the
united
states
from
to
in
russia
from
to
in
italy
from
to
and
in
japan
from
cents
to
it
is
in
connection
with
this
rough
estimate
of
cost
per
capita
that
the
economic
burden
of
militarism
is
most
appreciable
the
irresistible
conclusion
from
available
data
is
that
the
increase
of
expenditure
for
army
and
navy
purposes
is
rapidly
surpassing
the
growth
of
population
in
each
of
the
countries
considered
in
the
present
calculation
in
other
words
a
continuation
of
the
increased
demands
of
militarism
threatens
each
of
those
nations
with
a
progressive
exhaustion
both
of
men
and
resources
the
awful
waste
that
patriotism
necessitates
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
cure
the
man
of
even
average
intelligence
from
this
disease
yet
patriotism
demands
still
more
the
people
are
urged
to
be
patriotic
and
for
that
luxury
they
pay
not
only
by
supporting
their
defenders
but
even
by
sacrificing
their
own
children
patriotism
requires
allegiance
to
the
flag
which
means
obedience
and
readiness
to
kill
father
mother
brother
sister
the
usual
contention
is
that
we
need
a
standing
army
to
protect
the
country
from
foreign
invasion
every
intelligent
man
and
woman
knows
however
that
this
is
a
myth
maintained
to
frighten
and
coerce
the
foolish
the
governments
of
the
world
knowing
each
interests
do
not
invade
each
other
they
have
learned
that
they
can
gain
much
more
by
international
arbitration
of
disputes
than
by
war
and
conquest
indeed
as
carlyle
said
war
is
a
quarrel
between
two
thieves
too
cowardly
to
fight
their
own
battle
therefore
they
take
boys
from
one
village
and
another
village
stick
them
into
uniforms
equip
them
with
guns
and
let
them
loose
like
wild
beasts
against
each
other
it
does
not
require
much
wisdom
to
trace
every
war
back
to
a
similar
cause
let
us
take
our
own
war
supposedly
a
great
and
patriotic
event
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
how
our
hearts
burned
with
indignation
against
the
atrocious
spaniards
true
our
indignation
did
not
flare
up
spontaneously
it
was
nurtured
by
months
of
newspaper
agitation
and
long
after
butcher
weyler
had
killed
off
many
noble
cubans
and
outraged
many
cuban
women
still
in
justice
to
the
american
nation
be
it
said
it
did
grow
indignant
and
was
willing
to
fight
and
that
it
fought
bravely
but
when
the
smoke
was
over
the
dead
buried
and
the
cost
of
the
war
came
back
to
the
people
in
an
increase
in
the
price
of
commodities
and
rent
that
is
when
we
sobered
up
from
our
patriotic
spree
it
suddenly
dawned
on
us
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
the
consideration
of
the
price
of
sugar
or
to
be
more
explicit
that
the
lives
blood
and
money
of
the
american
people
were
used
to
protect
the
interests
of
american
capitalists
which
were
threatened
by
the
spanish
government
that
this
is
not
an
exaggeration
but
is
based
on
absolute
facts
and
figures
is
best
proven
by
the
attitude
of
the
american
government
to
cuban
labor
when
cuba
was
firmly
in
the
clutches
of
the
united
states
the
very
soldiers
sent
to
liberate
cuba
were
ordered
to
shoot
cuban
workingmen
during
the
great
cigarmakers
strike
which
took
place
shortly
after
the
war
nor
do
we
stand
alone
in
waging
war
for
such
causes
the
curtain
is
beginning
to
be
lifted
on
the
motives
of
the
terrible
war
which
cost
so
much
blood
and
tears
and
we
see
again
that
back
of
the
fierce
moloch
of
war
stands
the
still
fiercer
god
of
commercialism
kuropatkin
the
russian
minister
of
war
during
the
struggle
has
revealed
the
true
secret
behind
the
latter
the
tsar
and
his
grand
dukes
having
invested
money
in
corean
concessions
the
war
was
forced
for
the
sole
purpose
of
speedily
accumulating
large
fortunes
the
contention
that
a
standing
army
and
navy
is
the
best
security
of
peace
is
about
as
logical
as
the
claim
that
the
most
peaceful
citizen
is
he
who
goes
about
heavily
armed
the
experience
of
life
fully
proves
that
the
armed
individual
is
invariably
anxious
to
try
his
strength
the
same
is
historically
true
of
governments
really
peaceful
countries
do
not
waste
life
and
energy
in
war
preparations
with
the
result
that
peace
is
maintained
however
the
clamor
for
an
increased
army
and
navy
is
not
due
to
any
foreign
danger
it
is
owing
to
the
dread
of
the
growing
discontent
of
the
masses
and
of
the
international
spirit
among
the
workers
it
is
to
meet
the
internal
enemy
that
the
powers
of
various
countries
are
preparing
themselves
an
enemy
who
once
awakened
to
consciousness
will
prove
more
dangerous
than
any
foreign
invader
the
powers
that
have
for
centuries
been
engaged
in
enslaving
the
masses
have
made
a
thorough
study
of
their
psychology
they
know
that
the
people
at
large
are
like
children
whose
despair
sorrow
and
tears
can
be
turned
into
joy
with
a
little
toy
and
the
more
gorgeously
the
toy
is
dressed
the
louder
the
colors
the
more
it
will
appeal
to
the
child
an
army
and
navy
represents
the
people
toys
to
make
them
more
attractive
and
acceptable
hundreds
and
thousands
of
dollars
are
being
spent
for
the
display
of
these
toys
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
american
government
in
equipping
a
fleet
and
sending
it
along
the
pacific
coast
that
every
american
citizen
should
be
made
to
feel
the
pride
and
glory
of
the
united
states
the
city
of
san
francisco
spent
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
entertainment
of
the
fleet
los
angeles
sixty
thousand
seattle
and
tacoma
about
one
hundred
thousand
to
entertain
the
fleet
did
i
say
to
dine
and
wine
a
few
superior
officers
while
the
brave
boys
had
to
mutiny
to
get
sufficient
food
yes
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
dollars
were
spent
on
fireworks
theatre
parties
and
revelries
at
a
time
when
men
women
and
children
through
the
breadth
and
length
of
the
country
were
starving
in
the
streets
when
thousands
of
unemployed
were
ready
to
sell
their
labor
at
any
price
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
dollars
what
could
not
have
been
accomplished
with
such
an
enormous
sum
but
instead
of
bread
and
shelter
the
children
of
those
cities
were
taken
to
see
the
fleet
that
it
may
remain
as
one
of
the
newspapers
said
a
lasting
memory
for
the
child
a
wonderful
thing
to
remember
is
it
not
the
implements
of
civilized
slaughter
if
the
mind
of
the
child
is
to
be
poisoned
with
such
memories
what
hope
is
there
for
a
true
realization
of
human
brotherhood
we
americans
claim
to
be
a
people
we
hate
bloodshed
we
are
opposed
to
violence
yet
we
go
into
spasms
of
joy
over
the
possibility
of
projecting
dynamite
bombs
from
flying
machines
upon
helpless
citizens
we
are
ready
to
hang
electrocute
or
lynch
anyone
who
from
economic
necessity
will
risk
his
own
life
in
the
attempt
upon
that
of
some
industrial
magnate
yet
our
hearts
swell
with
pride
at
the
thought
that
america
is
becoming
the
most
powerful
nation
on
earth
and
that
it
will
eventually
plant
her
iron
foot
on
the
necks
of
all
other
nations
such
is
the
logic
of
patriotism
considering
the
evil
results
that
patriotism
is
fraught
with
for
the
average
man
it
is
as
nothing
compared
with
the
insult
and
injury
that
patriotism
heaps
upon
the
soldier
himself
that
poor
deluded
victim
of
superstition
and
ignorance
he
the
savior
of
his
country
the
protector
of
his
nation
what
has
patriotism
in
store
for
him
a
life
of
slavish
submission
vice
and
perversion
during
peace
a
life
of
danger
exposure
and
death
during
war
while
on
a
recent
lecture
tour
in
san
francisco
i
visited
the
presidio
the
most
beautiful
spot
overlooking
the
bay
and
golden
gate
park
its
purpose
should
have
been
playgrounds
for
children
gardens
and
music
for
the
recreation
of
the
weary
instead
it
is
made
ugly
dull
and
gray
by
barracks
barracks
wherein
the
rich
would
not
allow
their
dogs
to
dwell
in
these
miserable
shanties
soldiers
are
herded
like
cattle
here
they
waste
their
young
days
polishing
the
boots
and
brass
buttons
of
their
superior
officers
here
too
i
saw
the
distinction
of
classes
sturdy
sons
of
a
free
republic
drawn
up
in
line
like
convicts
saluting
every
passing
shrimp
of
a
lieutenant
american
equality
degrading
manhood
and
elevating
the
uniform
barrack
life
further
tends
to
develop
tendencies
of
sexual
perversion
it
is
gradually
producing
along
this
line
results
similar
to
european
military
conditions
havelock
ellis
the
noted
writer
on
sex
psychology
has
made
a
thorough
study
of
the
subject
i
quote
some
of
the
barracks
are
great
centers
of
male
prostitution
the
number
of
soldiers
who
prostitute
themselves
is
greater
than
we
are
willing
to
believe
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
in
certain
regiments
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
the
venality
of
the
majority
of
the
men
on
summer
evenings
hyde
park
and
the
neighborhood
of
albert
gate
are
full
of
guardsmen
and
others
plying
a
lively
trade
and
with
little
disguise
in
uniform
or
out
in
most
cases
the
proceeds
form
a
comfortable
addition
to
tommy
atkins
pocket
money
to
what
extent
this
perversion
has
eaten
its
way
into
the
army
and
navy
can
best
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
special
houses
exist
for
this
form
of
prostitution
the
practice
is
not
limited
to
england
it
is
universal
soldiers
are
no
less
sought
after
in
france
than
in
england
or
in
germany
and
special
houses
for
military
prostitution
exist
both
in
paris
and
the
garrison
towns
had
havelock
ellis
included
america
in
his
investigation
of
sex
perversion
he
would
have
found
that
the
same
conditions
prevail
in
our
army
and
navy
as
in
those
of
other
countries
the
growth
of
the
standing
army
inevitably
adds
to
the
spread
of
sex
perversion
the
barracks
are
the
incubators
aside
from
the
sexual
effects
of
barrack
life
it
also
tends
to
unfit
the
soldier
for
useful
labor
after
leaving
the
army
men
skilled
in
a
trade
seldom
enter
the
army
or
navy
but
even
they
after
a
military
experience
find
themselves
totally
unfitted
for
their
former
occupations
having
acquired
habits
of
idleness
and
a
taste
for
excitement
and
adventure
no
peaceful
pursuit
can
content
them
released
from
the
army
they
can
turn
to
no
useful
work
but
it
is
usually
the
social
discharged
prisoners
and
the
like
whom
either
the
struggle
for
life
or
their
own
inclination
drives
into
the
ranks
these
their
military
term
over
again
turn
to
their
former
life
of
crime
more
brutalized
and
degraded
than
before
it
is
a
fact
that
in
our
prisons
there
is
a
goodly
number
of
while
on
the
other
hand
the
army
and
navy
are
to
a
great
extent
supplied
with
of
all
the
evil
results
i
have
just
described
none
seems
to
me
so
detrimental
to
human
integrity
as
the
spirit
patriotism
has
produced
in
the
case
of
private
william
buwalda
because
he
foolishly
believed
that
one
can
be
a
soldier
and
exercise
his
rights
as
a
man
at
the
same
time
the
military
authorities
punished
him
severely
true
he
had
served
his
country
fifteen
years
during
which
time
his
record
was
unimpeachable
according
to
funston
who
reduced
buwalda
sentence
to
three
years
the
first
duty
of
an
officer
or
an
enlisted
man
is
unquestioned
obedience
and
loyalty
to
the
government
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
approves
of
that
government
or
not
thus
funston
stamps
the
true
character
of
allegiance
according
to
him
entrance
into
the
army
abrogates
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
what
a
strange
development
of
patriotism
that
turns
a
thinking
being
into
a
loyal
machine
in
justification
of
this
most
outrageous
sentence
of
buwalda
funston
tells
the
american
people
that
the
soldier
action
was
a
serious
crime
equal
to
treason
now
what
did
this
terrible
crime
really
consist
of
simply
in
this
william
buwalda
was
one
of
fifteen
hundred
people
who
attended
a
public
meeting
in
san
francisco
and
oh
horrors
he
shook
hands
with
the
speaker
emma
goldman
a
terrible
crime
indeed
which
the
general
calls
a
great
military
offense
infinitely
worse
than
desertion
can
there
be
a
greater
indictment
against
patriotism
than
that
it
will
thus
brand
a
man
a
criminal
throw
him
into
prison
and
rob
him
of
the
results
of
fifteen
years
of
faithful
service
buwalda
gave
to
his
country
the
best
years
of
his
life
and
his
very
manhood
but
all
that
was
as
nothing
patriotism
is
inexorable
and
like
all
insatiable
monsters
demands
all
or
nothing
it
does
not
admit
that
a
soldier
is
also
a
human
being
who
has
a
right
to
his
own
feelings
and
opinions
his
own
inclinations
and
ideas
no
patriotism
can
not
admit
of
that
that
is
the
lesson
which
buwalda
was
made
to
learn
made
to
learn
at
a
rather
costly
though
not
at
a
useless
price
when
he
returned
to
freedom
he
had
lost
his
position
in
the
army
but
he
regained
his
after
all
that
is
worth
three
years
of
imprisonment
a
writer
on
the
military
conditions
of
america
in
a
recent
article
commented
on
the
power
of
the
military
man
over
the
civilian
in
germany
he
said
among
other
things
that
if
our
republic
had
no
other
meaning
than
to
guarantee
all
citizens
equal
rights
it
would
have
just
cause
for
existence
i
am
convinced
that
the
writer
was
not
in
colorado
during
the
patriotic
regime
of
general
bell
he
probably
would
have
changed
his
mind
had
he
seen
how
in
the
name
of
patriotism
and
the
republic
men
were
thrown
into
dragged
about
driven
across
the
border
and
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
indignities
nor
is
that
colorado
incident
the
only
one
in
the
growth
of
military
power
in
the
united
states
there
is
hardly
a
strike
where
troops
and
militia
do
not
come
to
the
rescue
of
those
in
power
and
where
they
do
not
act
as
arrogantly
and
brutally
as
do
the
men
wearing
the
kaiser
uniform
then
too
we
have
the
dick
military
law
had
the
writer
forgotten
that
a
great
misfortune
with
most
of
our
writers
is
that
they
are
absolutely
ignorant
on
current
events
or
that
lacking
honesty
they
will
not
speak
of
these
matters
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
dick
military
law
was
rushed
through
congress
with
little
discussion
and
still
less
publicity
a
law
which
gives
the
president
the
power
to
turn
a
peaceful
citizen
into
a
bloodthirsty
supposedly
for
the
defense
of
the
country
in
reality
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
that
particular
party
whose
mouthpiece
the
president
happens
to
be
our
writer
claims
that
militarism
can
never
become
such
a
power
in
america
as
abroad
since
it
is
voluntary
with
us
while
compulsory
in
the
old
world
two
very
important
facts
however
the
gentleman
forgets
to
consider
first
that
conscription
has
created
in
europe
a
hatred
of
militarism
among
all
classes
of
society
thousands
of
young
recruits
enlist
under
protest
and
once
in
the
army
they
will
use
every
possible
means
to
desert
second
that
it
is
the
compulsory
feature
of
militarism
which
has
created
a
tremendous
movement
feared
by
european
powers
far
more
than
anything
else
after
all
the
greatest
bulwark
of
capitalism
is
militarism
the
very
moment
the
latter
is
undermined
capitalism
will
totter
true
we
have
no
conscription
that
is
men
are
not
usually
forced
to
enlist
in
the
army
but
we
have
developed
a
far
more
exacting
and
rigid
force
necessity
is
it
not
a
fact
that
during
industrial
depressions
there
is
a
tremendous
increase
in
the
number
of
enlistments
the
trade
of
militarism
may
not
be
either
lucrative
or
honorable
but
it
is
better
than
tramping
the
country
in
search
of
work
standing
in
the
bread
line
or
sleeping
in
municipal
lodging
houses
after
all
it
means
thirteen
dollars
per
month
three
meals
a
day
and
a
place
to
sleep
yet
even
necessity
is
not
sufficiently
strong
a
factor
to
bring
into
the
army
an
element
of
character
and
manhood
no
wonder
our
military
authorities
complain
of
the
poor
material
enlisting
in
the
army
and
navy
this
admission
is
a
very
encouraging
sign
it
proves
that
there
is
still
enough
of
the
spirit
of
independence
and
love
of
liberty
left
in
the
average
american
to
risk
starvation
rather
than
don
the
uniform
thinking
men
and
women
the
world
over
are
beginning
to
realize
that
patriotism
is
too
narrow
and
limited
a
conception
to
meet
the
necessities
of
our
time
the
centralization
of
power
has
brought
into
being
an
international
feeling
of
solidarity
among
the
oppressed
nations
of
the
world
a
solidarity
which
represents
a
greater
harmony
of
interests
between
the
workingman
of
america
and
his
brothers
abroad
than
between
the
american
miner
and
his
exploiting
compatriot
a
solidarity
which
fears
not
foreign
invasion
because
it
is
bringing
all
the
workers
to
the
point
when
they
will
say
to
their
masters
go
and
do
your
own
killing
we
have
done
it
long
enough
for
you
this
solidarity
is
awakening
the
consciousness
of
even
the
soldiers
they
too
being
flesh
of
the
flesh
of
the
great
human
family
a
solidarity
that
has
proven
infallible
more
than
once
during
past
struggles
and
which
has
been
the
impetus
inducing
the
parisian
soldiers
during
the
commune
of
to
refuse
to
obey
when
ordered
to
shoot
their
brothers
it
has
given
courage
to
the
men
who
mutinied
on
russian
warships
during
recent
years
it
will
eventually
bring
about
the
uprising
of
all
the
oppressed
and
downtrodden
against
their
international
exploiters
the
proletariat
of
europe
has
realized
the
great
force
of
that
solidarity
and
has
as
a
result
inaugurated
a
war
against
patriotism
and
its
bloody
spectre
militarism
thousands
of
men
fill
the
prisons
of
france
germany
russia
and
the
scandinavian
countries
because
they
dared
to
defy
the
ancient
superstition
nor
is
the
movement
limited
to
the
working
class
it
has
embraced
representatives
in
all
stations
of
life
its
chief
exponents
being
men
and
women
prominent
in
art
science
and
letters
america
will
have
to
follow
suit
the
spirit
of
militarism
has
already
permeated
all
walks
of
life
indeed
i
am
convinced
that
militarism
is
growing
a
greater
danger
here
than
anywhere
else
because
of
the
many
bribes
capitalism
holds
out
to
those
whom
it
wishes
to
destroy
the
beginning
has
already
been
made
in
the
schools
evidently
the
government
holds
to
the
jesuitical
conception
give
me
the
child
mind
and
i
will
mould
the
man
children
are
trained
in
military
tactics
the
glory
of
military
achievements
extolled
in
the
curriculum
and
the
youthful
minds
perverted
to
suit
the
government
further
the
youth
of
the
country
is
appealed
to
in
glaring
posters
to
join
the
army
and
navy
a
fine
chance
to
see
the
world
cries
the
governmental
huckster
thus
innocent
boys
are
morally
shanghaied
into
patriotism
and
the
military
moloch
strides
conquering
through
the
nation
the
american
workingman
has
suffered
so
much
at
the
hands
of
the
soldier
state
and
federal
that
he
is
quite
justified
in
his
disgust
with
and
his
opposition
to
the
uniformed
parasite
however
mere
denunciation
will
not
solve
this
great
problem
what
we
need
is
a
propaganda
of
education
for
the
soldier
literature
that
will
enlighten
him
as
to
the
real
horrors
of
his
trade
and
that
will
awaken
his
consciousness
to
his
true
relation
to
the
man
to
whose
labor
he
owes
his
very
existence
it
is
precisely
this
that
the
authorities
fear
most
it
is
already
high
treason
for
a
soldier
to
attend
a
radical
meeting
no
doubt
they
will
also
stamp
it
high
treason
for
a
soldier
to
read
a
radical
pamphlet
but
then
has
not
authority
from
time
immemorial
stamped
every
step
of
progress
as
treasonable
those
however
who
earnestly
strive
for
social
reconstruction
can
well
afford
to
face
all
that
for
it
is
probably
even
more
important
to
carry
the
truth
into
the
barracks
than
into
the
factory
when
we
have
undermined
the
patriotic
lie
we
shall
have
cleared
the
path
for
that
great
structure
wherein
all
nationalities
shall
be
united
into
a
universal
brotherhood
a
truly
free
society
francisco
ferrer
and
the
modern
school
experience
has
come
to
be
considered
the
best
school
of
life
the
man
or
woman
who
does
not
learn
some
vital
lesson
in
that
school
is
looked
upon
as
a
dunce
indeed
yet
strange
to
say
that
though
organized
institutions
continue
perpetrating
errors
though
they
learn
nothing
from
experience
we
acquiesce
as
a
matter
of
course
there
lived
and
worked
in
barcelona
a
man
by
the
name
of
francisco
ferrer
a
teacher
of
children
he
was
known
and
loved
by
his
people
outside
of
spain
only
the
cultured
few
knew
of
francisco
work
to
the
world
at
large
this
teacher
was
on
the
first
of
september
the
spanish
government
at
the
behest
of
the
catholic
church
arrested
francisco
ferrer
on
the
thirteenth
of
october
after
a
mock
trial
he
was
placed
in
the
ditch
at
montjuich
prison
against
the
hideous
wall
of
many
sighs
and
shot
dead
instantly
ferrer
the
obscure
teacher
became
a
universal
figure
blazing
forth
the
indignation
and
wrath
of
the
whole
civilized
world
against
the
wanton
murder
the
killing
of
francisco
ferrer
was
not
the
first
crime
committed
by
the
spanish
government
and
the
catholic
church
the
history
of
these
institutions
is
one
long
stream
of
fire
and
blood
still
they
have
not
learned
through
experience
nor
yet
come
to
realize
that
every
frail
being
slain
by
church
and
state
grows
and
grows
into
a
mighty
giant
who
will
some
day
free
humanity
from
their
perilous
hold
francisco
ferrer
was
born
in
of
humble
parents
they
were
catholics
and
therefore
hoped
to
raise
their
son
in
the
same
faith
they
did
not
know
that
the
boy
was
to
become
the
harbinger
of
a
great
truth
that
his
mind
would
refuse
to
travel
in
the
old
path
at
an
early
age
ferrer
began
to
question
the
faith
of
his
fathers
he
demanded
to
know
how
it
is
that
the
god
who
spoke
to
him
of
goodness
and
love
would
mar
the
sleep
of
the
innocent
child
with
dread
and
awe
of
tortures
of
suffering
of
hell
alert
and
of
a
vivid
and
investigating
mind
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
discover
the
hideousness
of
that
black
monster
the
catholic
church
he
would
have
none
of
it
francisco
ferrer
was
not
only
a
doubter
a
searcher
for
truth
he
was
also
a
rebel
his
spirit
would
rise
in
just
indignation
against
the
iron
regime
of
his
country
and
when
a
band
of
rebels
led
by
the
brave
patriot
general
villacampa
under
the
banner
of
the
republican
ideal
made
an
onslaught
on
that
regime
none
was
more
ardent
a
fighter
than
young
francisco
ferrer
the
republican
ideal
i
hope
no
one
will
confound
it
with
the
republicanism
of
this
country
whatever
objection
i
as
an
anarchist
have
to
the
republicans
of
latin
countries
i
know
they
tower
high
above
the
corrupt
and
reactionary
party
which
in
america
is
destroying
every
vestige
of
liberty
and
justice
one
has
but
to
think
of
the
mazzinis
the
garibaldis
the
scores
of
others
to
realize
that
their
efforts
were
directed
not
merely
towards
the
overthrow
of
despotism
but
particularly
against
the
catholic
church
which
from
its
very
inception
has
been
the
enemy
of
all
progress
and
liberalism
in
america
it
is
just
the
reverse
republicanism
stands
for
vested
rights
for
imperialism
for
graft
for
the
annihilation
of
every
semblance
of
liberty
its
ideal
is
the
oily
creepy
respectability
of
a
mckinley
and
the
brutal
arrogance
of
a
roosevelt
the
spanish
republican
rebels
were
subdued
it
takes
more
than
one
brave
effort
to
split
the
rock
of
ages
to
cut
off
the
head
of
that
hydra
monster
the
catholic
church
and
the
spanish
throne
arrest
persecution
and
punishment
followed
the
heroic
attempt
of
the
little
band
those
who
could
escape
the
bloodhounds
had
to
flee
for
safety
to
foreign
shores
francisco
ferrer
was
among
the
latter
he
went
to
france
how
his
soul
must
have
expanded
in
the
new
land
france
the
cradle
of
liberty
of
ideas
of
action
paris
the
ever
young
intense
paris
with
her
pulsating
life
after
the
gloom
of
his
own
belated
country
how
she
must
have
inspired
him
what
opportunities
what
a
glorious
chance
for
a
young
idealist
francisco
ferrer
lost
no
time
like
one
famished
he
threw
himself
into
the
various
liberal
movements
met
all
kinds
of
people
learned
absorbed
and
grew
while
there
he
also
saw
in
operation
the
modern
school
which
was
to
play
such
an
important
and
fatal
part
in
his
life
the
modern
school
in
france
was
founded
long
before
ferrer
time
its
originator
though
on
a
small
scale
was
that
sweet
spirit
louise
michel
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
our
own
great
louise
felt
long
ago
that
the
future
belongs
to
the
young
generation
that
unless
the
young
be
rescued
from
that
mind
and
soul
destroying
institution
the
bourgeois
school
social
evils
will
continue
to
exist
perhaps
she
thought
with
ibsen
that
the
atmosphere
is
saturated
with
ghosts
that
the
adult
man
and
woman
have
so
many
superstitions
to
overcome
no
sooner
do
they
outgrow
the
deathlike
grip
of
one
spook
lo
they
find
themselves
in
the
thralldom
of
other
spooks
thus
but
a
few
reach
the
mountain
peak
of
complete
regeneration
the
child
however
has
no
traditions
to
overcome
its
mind
is
not
burdened
with
set
ideas
its
heart
has
not
grown
cold
with
class
and
caste
distinctions
the
child
is
to
the
teacher
what
clay
is
to
the
sculptor
whether
the
world
will
receive
a
work
of
art
or
a
wretched
imitation
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
the
creative
power
of
the
teacher
louise
michel
was
qualified
to
meet
the
child
soul
cravings
was
she
not
herself
of
a
childlike
nature
so
sweet
and
tender
unsophisticated
and
generous
the
soul
of
louise
burned
always
at
white
heat
over
every
social
injustice
she
was
invariably
in
the
front
ranks
whenever
the
people
of
paris
rebelled
against
some
wrong
and
as
she
was
made
to
suffer
imprisonment
for
her
great
devotion
to
the
oppressed
the
little
school
on
montmartre
was
soon
no
more
but
the
seed
was
planted
and
has
since
borne
fruit
in
many
cities
of
france
the
most
important
venture
of
a
modern
school
was
that
of
the
great
young
old
man
paul
robin
together
with
a
few
friends
he
established
a
large
school
at
cempuis
a
beautiful
place
near
paris
paul
robin
aimed
at
a
higher
ideal
than
merely
modern
ideas
in
education
he
wanted
to
demonstrate
by
actual
facts
that
the
bourgeois
conception
of
heredity
is
but
a
mere
pretext
to
exempt
society
from
its
terrible
crimes
against
the
young
the
contention
that
the
child
must
suffer
for
the
sins
of
the
fathers
that
it
must
continue
in
poverty
and
filth
that
it
must
grow
up
a
drunkard
or
criminal
just
because
its
parents
left
it
no
other
legacy
was
too
preposterous
to
the
beautiful
spirit
of
paul
robin
he
believed
that
whatever
part
heredity
may
play
there
are
other
factors
equally
great
if
not
greater
that
may
and
will
eradicate
or
minimize
the
first
cause
proper
economic
and
social
environment
the
breath
and
freedom
of
nature
healthy
exercise
love
and
sympathy
and
above
all
a
deep
understanding
for
the
needs
of
the
child
these
would
destroy
the
cruel
unjust
and
criminal
stigma
imposed
on
the
innocent
young
paul
robin
did
not
select
his
children
he
did
not
go
to
the
best
parents
he
took
his
material
wherever
he
could
find
it
from
the
street
the
hovels
the
orphan
and
foundling
asylums
the
reformatories
from
all
those
gray
and
hideous
places
where
a
benevolent
society
hides
its
victims
in
order
to
pacify
its
guilty
conscience
he
gathered
all
the
dirty
filthy
shivering
little
waifs
his
place
would
hold
and
brought
them
to
cempuis
there
surrounded
by
nature
own
glory
free
and
unrestrained
well
fed
clean
kept
deeply
loved
and
understood
the
little
human
plants
began
to
grow
to
blossom
to
develop
beyond
even
the
expectations
of
their
friend
and
teacher
paul
robin
the
children
grew
and
developed
into
liberty
loving
men
and
women
what
greater
danger
to
the
institutions
that
make
the
poor
in
order
to
perpetuate
the
poor
cempuis
was
closed
by
the
french
government
on
the
charge
of
which
is
prohibited
in
france
however
cempuis
had
been
in
operation
long
enough
to
prove
to
all
advanced
educators
its
tremendous
possibilities
and
to
serve
as
an
impetus
for
modern
methods
of
education
that
are
slowly
but
inevitably
undermining
the
present
system
cempuis
was
followed
by
a
great
number
of
other
educational
attempts
among
them
by
madelaine
vernet
a
gifted
writer
and
poet
author
of
libre
and
sebastian
faure
with
his
la
ruche
which
i
visited
while
in
paris
in
several
years
ago
comrade
faure
bought
the
land
on
which
he
built
his
la
ruche
in
a
comparatively
short
time
he
succeeded
in
transforming
the
former
wild
uncultivated
country
into
a
blooming
spot
having
all
the
appearance
of
a
well
kept
farm
a
large
square
court
enclosed
by
three
buildings
and
a
broad
path
leading
to
the
garden
and
orchards
greet
the
eye
of
the
visitor
the
garden
kept
as
only
a
frenchman
knows
how
furnishes
a
large
variety
of
vegetables
for
la
ruche
sebastian
faure
is
of
the
opinion
that
if
the
child
is
subjected
to
contradictory
influences
its
development
suffers
in
consequence
only
when
the
material
needs
the
hygiene
of
the
home
and
intellectual
environment
are
harmonious
can
the
child
grow
into
a
healthy
free
being
referring
to
his
school
sebastian
faure
has
this
to
say
i
have
taken
children
of
both
sexes
mostly
orphans
or
those
whose
parents
are
too
poor
to
pay
they
are
clothed
housed
and
educated
at
my
expense
till
their
twelfth
year
they
will
receive
a
sound
elementary
education
between
the
age
of
twelve
and
fifteen
their
studies
still
continuing
they
are
to
be
taught
some
trade
in
keeping
with
their
individual
disposition
and
abilities
after
that
they
are
at
liberty
to
leave
la
ruche
to
begin
life
in
the
outside
world
with
the
assurance
that
they
may
at
any
time
return
to
la
ruche
where
they
will
be
received
with
open
arms
and
welcomed
as
parents
do
their
beloved
children
then
if
they
wish
to
work
at
our
place
they
may
do
so
under
the
following
conditions
one
third
of
the
product
to
cover
his
or
her
expenses
of
maintenance
another
third
to
go
towards
the
general
fund
set
aside
for
accommodating
new
children
and
the
last
third
to
be
devoted
to
the
personal
use
of
the
child
as
he
or
she
may
see
fit
the
health
of
the
children
who
are
now
in
my
care
is
perfect
pure
air
nutritious
food
physical
exercise
in
the
open
long
walks
observation
of
hygienic
rules
the
short
and
interesting
method
of
instruction
and
above
all
our
affectionate
understanding
and
care
of
the
children
have
produced
admirable
physical
and
mental
results
it
would
be
unjust
to
claim
that
our
pupils
have
accomplished
wonders
yet
considering
that
they
belong
to
the
average
having
had
no
previous
opportunities
the
results
are
very
gratifying
indeed
the
most
important
thing
they
have
acquired
a
rare
trait
with
ordinary
school
children
is
the
love
of
study
the
desire
to
know
to
be
informed
they
have
learned
a
new
method
of
work
one
that
quickens
the
memory
and
stimulates
the
imagination
we
make
a
particular
effort
to
awaken
the
child
interest
in
his
surroundings
to
make
him
realize
the
importance
of
observation
investigation
and
reflection
so
that
when
the
children
reach
maturity
they
would
not
be
deaf
and
blind
to
the
things
about
them
our
children
never
accept
anything
in
blind
faith
without
inquiry
as
to
why
and
wherefore
nor
do
they
feel
satisfied
until
their
questions
are
thoroughly
answered
thus
their
minds
are
free
from
doubts
and
fear
resultant
from
incomplete
or
untruthful
replies
it
is
the
latter
which
warp
the
growth
of
the
child
and
create
a
lack
of
confidence
in
himself
and
those
about
him
it
is
surprising
how
frank
and
kind
and
affectionate
our
little
ones
are
to
each
other
the
harmony
between
themselves
and
the
adults
at
la
ruche
is
highly
encouraging
we
should
feel
at
fault
if
the
children
were
to
fear
or
honor
us
merely
because
we
are
their
elders
we
leave
nothing
undone
to
gain
their
confidence
and
love
that
accomplished
understanding
will
replace
duty
confidence
fear
and
affection
severity
no
one
has
yet
fully
realized
the
wealth
of
sympathy
kindness
and
generosity
hidden
in
the
soul
of
the
child
the
effort
of
every
true
educator
should
be
to
unlock
that
treasure
to
stimulate
the
impulses
and
call
forth
the
best
and
noblest
tendencies
what
greater
reward
can
there
be
for
one
whose
is
to
watch
over
the
growth
of
the
human
plant
than
to
see
its
nature
unfold
its
petals
and
to
observe
it
develop
into
a
true
individuality
my
comrades
at
la
ruche
look
for
no
greater
reward
and
it
is
due
to
them
and
their
efforts
even
more
than
to
my
own
that
our
human
garden
promises
to
bear
beautiful
fruit
regarding
the
subject
of
history
and
the
prevailing
old
methods
of
instruction
sebastian
faure
said
we
explain
to
our
children
that
true
history
is
yet
to
be
written
the
story
of
those
who
have
died
unknown
in
the
effort
to
aid
humanity
to
greater
achievement
francisco
ferrer
could
not
escape
this
great
wave
of
modern
school
attempts
he
saw
its
possibilities
not
merely
in
theoretic
form
but
in
their
practical
application
to
needs
he
must
have
realized
that
spain
more
than
any
other
country
stands
in
need
of
just
such
schools
if
it
is
ever
to
throw
off
the
double
yoke
of
priest
and
soldier
when
we
consider
that
the
entire
system
of
education
in
spain
is
in
the
hands
of
the
catholic
church
and
when
we
further
remember
the
catholic
formula
to
inculcate
catholicism
in
the
mind
of
the
child
until
it
is
nine
years
of
age
is
to
ruin
it
forever
for
any
other
idea
we
will
understand
the
tremendous
task
of
ferrer
in
bringing
the
new
light
to
his
people
fate
soon
assisted
him
in
realizing
his
great
dream
mlle
meunier
a
pupil
of
francisco
ferrer
and
a
lady
of
wealth
became
interested
in
the
modern
school
project
when
she
died
she
left
ferrer
some
valuable
property
and
twelve
thousand
francs
yearly
income
for
the
school
it
is
said
that
mean
souls
can
conceive
of
naught
but
mean
ideas
if
so
the
contemptible
methods
of
the
catholic
church
to
blackguard
ferrer
character
in
order
to
justify
her
own
black
crime
can
readily
be
explained
thus
the
lie
was
spread
in
american
catholic
papers
that
ferrer
used
his
intimacy
with
mlle
meunier
to
get
possession
of
her
money
personally
i
hold
that
the
intimacy
of
whatever
nature
between
a
man
and
a
woman
is
their
own
affair
their
sacred
own
i
would
therefore
not
lose
a
word
in
referring
to
the
matter
if
it
were
not
one
of
the
many
dastardly
lies
circulated
about
ferrer
of
course
those
who
know
the
purity
of
the
catholic
clergy
will
understand
the
insinuation
have
the
catholic
priests
ever
looked
upon
woman
as
anything
but
a
sex
commodity
the
historical
data
regarding
the
discoveries
in
the
cloisters
and
monasteries
will
bear
me
out
in
that
how
then
are
they
to
understand
the
of
a
man
and
a
woman
except
on
a
sex
basis
as
a
matter
of
fact
mlle
meunier
was
considerably
ferrer
senior
having
spent
her
childhood
and
girlhood
with
a
miserly
father
and
a
submissive
mother
she
could
easily
appreciate
the
necessity
of
love
and
joy
in
child
life
she
must
have
seen
that
francisco
ferrer
was
a
teacher
not
college
machine
or
but
one
endowed
with
genius
for
that
calling
equipped
with
knowledge
with
experience
and
with
the
necessary
means
above
all
imbued
with
the
divine
fire
of
his
mission
our
comrade
came
back
to
spain
and
there
began
his
life
work
on
the
ninth
of
september
the
first
modern
school
was
opened
it
was
enthusiastically
received
by
the
people
of
barcelona
who
pledged
their
support
in
a
short
address
at
the
opening
of
the
school
ferrer
submitted
his
program
to
his
friends
he
said
i
am
not
a
speaker
not
a
propagandist
not
a
fighter
i
am
a
teacher
i
love
children
above
everything
i
think
i
understand
them
i
want
my
contribution
to
the
cause
of
liberty
to
be
a
young
generation
ready
to
meet
a
new
era
he
was
cautioned
by
his
friends
to
be
careful
in
his
opposition
to
the
catholic
church
they
knew
to
what
lengths
she
would
go
to
dispose
of
an
enemy
ferrer
too
knew
but
like
brand
he
believed
in
all
or
nothing
he
would
not
erect
the
modern
school
on
the
same
old
lie
he
would
be
frank
and
honest
and
open
with
the
children
francisco
ferrer
became
a
marked
man
from
the
very
first
day
of
the
opening
of
the
school
he
was
shadowed
the
school
building
was
watched
his
little
home
in
mangat
was
watched
he
was
followed
every
step
even
when
he
went
to
france
or
england
to
confer
with
his
colleagues
he
was
a
marked
man
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
when
the
lurking
enemy
would
tighten
the
noose
it
succeeded
almost
in
when
ferrer
was
implicated
in
the
attempt
on
the
life
of
alfonso
the
evidence
exonerating
him
was
too
strong
even
for
the
black
crows
they
had
to
let
him
go
not
for
good
however
they
waited
oh
they
can
wait
when
they
have
set
themselves
to
trap
a
victim
the
moment
came
at
last
during
the
uprising
in
spain
in
july
one
will
have
to
search
in
vain
the
annals
of
revolutionary
history
to
find
a
more
remarkable
protest
against
militarism
having
been
for
centuries
the
people
of
spain
could
stand
the
yoke
no
longer
they
would
refuse
to
participate
in
useless
slaughter
they
saw
no
reason
for
aiding
a
despotic
government
in
subduing
and
oppressing
a
small
people
fighting
for
their
independence
as
did
the
brave
riffs
no
they
would
not
bear
arms
against
them
for
eighteen
hundred
years
the
catholic
church
has
preached
the
gospel
of
peace
yet
when
the
people
actually
wanted
to
make
this
gospel
a
living
reality
she
urged
the
authorities
to
force
them
to
bear
arms
thus
the
dynasty
of
spain
followed
the
murderous
methods
of
the
russian
dynasty
the
people
were
forced
to
the
battlefield
then
and
not
until
then
was
their
power
of
endurance
at
an
end
then
and
not
until
then
did
the
workers
of
spain
turn
against
their
masters
against
those
who
like
leeches
had
drained
their
strength
their
very
yes
they
attacked
the
churches
and
the
priests
but
if
the
latter
had
a
thousand
lives
they
could
not
possibly
pay
for
the
terrible
outrages
and
crimes
perpetrated
upon
the
spanish
people
francisco
ferrer
was
arrested
on
the
first
of
september
until
october
first
his
friends
and
comrades
did
not
even
know
what
had
become
of
him
on
that
day
a
letter
was
received
by
from
which
can
be
learned
the
whole
mockery
of
the
trial
and
the
next
day
his
companion
soledad
villafranca
received
the
following
letter
no
reason
to
worry
you
know
i
am
absolutely
innocent
today
i
am
particularly
hopeful
and
joyous
it
is
the
first
time
i
can
write
to
you
and
the
first
time
since
my
arrest
that
i
can
bathe
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
streaming
generously
through
my
cell
window
you
too
must
be
joyous
how
pathetic
that
ferrer
should
have
believed
as
late
as
october
fourth
that
he
would
not
be
condemned
to
death
even
more
pathetic
that
his
friends
and
comrades
should
once
more
have
made
the
blunder
in
crediting
the
enemy
with
a
sense
of
justice
time
and
again
they
had
placed
faith
in
the
judicial
powers
only
to
see
their
brothers
killed
before
their
very
eyes
they
made
no
preparation
to
rescue
ferrer
not
even
a
protest
of
any
extent
nothing
why
it
is
impossible
to
condemn
ferrer
he
is
innocent
but
everything
is
possible
with
the
catholic
church
is
she
not
a
practiced
henchman
whose
trials
of
her
enemies
are
the
worst
mockery
of
justice
on
october
fourth
ferrer
sent
the
following
letter
to
the
prison
cell
my
dear
friends
notwithstanding
most
absolute
innocence
the
prosecutor
demands
the
death
penalty
based
on
denunciations
of
the
police
representing
me
as
the
chief
of
the
anarchists
directing
the
labor
syndicates
of
france
and
guilty
of
conspiracies
and
insurrections
everywhere
and
declaring
that
my
voyages
to
london
and
paris
were
undertaken
with
no
other
object
with
such
infamous
lies
they
are
trying
to
kill
me
the
messenger
is
about
to
depart
and
i
have
not
time
for
more
all
the
evidence
presented
to
the
investigating
judge
by
the
police
is
nothing
but
a
tissue
of
lies
and
calumnious
insinuations
but
no
proofs
against
me
having
done
nothing
at
all
ferrer
october
thirteenth
ferrer
heart
so
brave
so
staunch
so
loyal
was
stilled
poor
fools
the
last
agonized
throb
of
that
heart
had
barely
died
away
when
it
began
to
beat
a
hundredfold
in
the
hearts
of
the
civilized
world
until
it
grew
into
terrific
thunder
hurling
forth
its
malediction
upon
the
instigators
of
the
black
crime
murderers
of
black
garb
and
pious
mien
to
the
bar
of
justice
did
francisco
ferrer
participate
in
the
uprising
according
to
the
first
indictment
which
appeared
in
a
catholic
paper
in
madrid
signed
by
the
bishop
and
all
the
prelates
of
barcelona
he
was
not
even
accused
of
participation
the
indictment
was
to
the
effect
that
francisco
ferrer
was
guilty
of
having
organized
godless
schools
and
having
circulated
godless
literature
but
in
the
twentieth
century
men
can
not
be
burned
merely
for
their
godless
beliefs
something
else
had
to
be
devised
hence
the
charge
of
instigating
the
uprising
in
no
authentic
source
so
far
investigated
could
a
single
proof
be
found
to
connect
ferrer
with
the
uprising
but
then
no
proofs
were
wanted
or
accepted
by
the
authorities
there
were
witnesses
to
be
sure
but
their
testimony
was
taken
on
paper
they
never
were
confronted
with
ferrer
or
he
with
them
is
it
psychologically
possible
that
ferrer
should
have
participated
i
do
not
believe
it
is
and
here
are
my
reasons
francisco
ferrer
was
not
only
a
great
teacher
but
he
was
also
undoubtedly
a
marvelous
organizer
in
eight
years
between
he
had
organized
in
spain
one
hundred
and
nine
schools
besides
inducing
the
liberal
element
of
his
country
to
organize
three
hundred
and
eight
other
schools
in
connection
with
his
own
school
work
ferrer
had
equipped
a
modern
printing
plant
organized
a
staff
of
translators
and
spread
broadcast
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
copies
of
modern
scientific
and
sociologic
works
not
to
forget
the
large
quantity
of
rationalist
text
books
surely
none
but
the
most
methodical
and
efficient
organizer
could
have
accomplished
such
a
feat
on
the
other
hand
it
was
absolutely
proven
that
the
uprising
was
not
at
all
organized
that
it
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
people
themselves
like
a
great
many
revolutionary
waves
on
previous
occasions
the
people
of
barcelona
for
instance
had
the
city
in
their
control
for
four
days
and
according
to
the
statement
of
tourists
greater
order
and
peace
never
prevailed
of
course
the
people
were
so
little
prepared
that
when
the
time
came
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
in
this
regard
they
were
like
the
people
of
paris
during
the
commune
of
they
too
were
unprepared
while
they
were
starving
they
protected
the
warehouses
filled
to
the
brim
with
provisions
they
placed
sentinels
to
guard
the
bank
of
france
where
the
bourgeoisie
kept
the
stolen
money
the
workers
of
barcelona
too
watched
over
the
spoils
of
their
masters
how
pathetic
is
the
stupidity
of
the
underdog
how
terribly
tragic
but
then
have
not
his
fetters
been
forged
so
deeply
into
his
flesh
that
he
would
not
even
if
he
could
break
them
the
awe
of
authority
of
law
of
private
property
hundredfold
burned
into
his
soul
how
is
he
to
throw
it
off
unprepared
unexpectedly
can
anyone
assume
for
a
moment
that
a
man
like
ferrer
would
affiliate
himself
with
such
a
spontaneous
unorganized
effort
would
he
not
have
known
that
it
would
result
in
a
defeat
a
disastrous
defeat
for
the
people
and
is
it
not
more
likely
that
if
he
would
have
taken
part
he
the
experienced
entrepreneur
would
have
thoroughly
organized
the
attempt
if
all
other
proofs
were
lacking
that
one
factor
would
be
sufficient
to
exonerate
francisco
ferrer
but
there
are
others
equally
convincing
for
the
very
date
of
the
outbreak
july
ferrer
had
called
a
conference
of
his
teachers
and
members
of
the
league
of
rational
education
it
was
to
consider
the
autumn
work
and
particularly
the
publication
of
elisee
reclus
great
book
et
la
terre
and
peter
kropotkin
great
french
revolution
is
it
at
all
likely
is
it
at
all
plausible
that
ferrer
knowing
of
the
uprising
being
a
party
to
it
would
in
cold
blood
invite
his
friends
and
colleagues
to
barcelona
for
the
day
on
which
he
realized
their
lives
would
be
endangered
surely
only
the
criminal
vicious
mind
of
a
jesuit
could
credit
such
deliberate
murder
francisco
ferrer
had
his
mapped
out
he
had
everything
to
lose
and
nothing
to
gain
except
ruin
and
disaster
were
he
to
lend
assistance
to
the
outbreak
not
that
he
doubted
the
justice
of
the
people
wrath
but
his
work
his
hope
his
very
nature
was
directed
toward
another
goal
in
vain
are
the
frantic
efforts
of
the
catholic
church
her
lies
falsehoods
calumnies
she
stands
condemned
by
the
awakened
human
conscience
of
having
once
more
repeated
the
foul
crimes
of
the
past
francisco
ferrer
is
accused
of
teaching
the
children
the
most
ideas
to
hate
god
for
instance
horrors
francisco
ferrer
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
god
why
teach
the
child
to
hate
something
which
does
not
exist
is
it
not
more
likely
that
he
took
the
children
out
into
the
open
that
he
showed
them
the
splendor
of
the
sunset
the
brilliancy
of
the
starry
heavens
the
wonder
of
the
mountains
and
seas
that
he
explained
to
them
in
his
simple
direct
way
the
law
of
growth
of
development
of
the
interrelation
of
all
life
in
so
doing
he
made
it
forever
impossible
for
the
poisonous
weeds
of
the
catholic
church
to
take
root
in
the
child
mind
it
has
been
stated
that
ferrer
prepared
the
children
to
destroy
the
rich
ghost
stories
of
old
maids
is
it
not
more
likely
that
he
prepared
them
to
succor
the
poor
that
he
taught
them
the
humiliation
the
degradation
the
awfulness
of
poverty
which
is
a
vice
and
not
a
virtue
that
he
taught
the
dignity
and
importance
of
all
creative
efforts
which
alone
sustain
life
and
build
character
is
it
not
the
best
and
most
effective
way
of
bringing
into
the
proper
light
the
absolute
uselessness
and
injury
of
parasitism
last
but
not
least
ferrer
is
charged
with
undermining
the
army
by
inculcating
ideas
indeed
he
must
have
believed
with
tolstoy
that
war
is
legalized
slaughter
that
it
perpetuates
hatred
and
arrogance
that
it
eats
away
the
heart
of
nations
and
turns
them
into
raving
maniacs
however
we
have
ferrer
own
word
regarding
his
ideas
of
modern
education
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
my
readers
to
this
idea
all
the
value
of
education
rests
in
the
respect
for
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
will
of
the
child
just
as
in
science
no
demonstration
is
possible
save
by
facts
just
so
there
is
no
real
education
save
that
which
is
exempt
from
all
dogmatism
which
leaves
to
the
child
itself
the
direction
of
its
effort
and
confines
itself
to
the
seconding
of
its
effort
now
there
is
nothing
easier
than
to
alter
this
purpose
and
nothing
harder
than
to
respect
it
education
is
always
imposing
violating
constraining
the
real
educator
is
he
who
can
best
protect
the
child
against
his
the
teacher
own
ideas
his
peculiar
whims
he
who
can
best
appeal
to
the
child
own
energies
we
are
convinced
that
the
education
of
the
future
will
be
of
an
entirely
spontaneous
nature
certainly
we
can
not
as
yet
realize
it
but
the
evolution
of
methods
in
the
direction
of
a
wider
comprehension
of
the
phenomena
of
life
and
the
fact
that
all
advances
toward
perfection
mean
the
overcoming
of
restraint
all
this
indicates
that
we
are
in
the
right
when
we
hope
for
the
deliverance
of
the
child
through
science
let
us
not
fear
to
say
that
we
want
men
capable
of
evolving
without
stopping
capable
of
destroying
and
renewing
their
environments
without
cessation
of
renewing
themselves
also
men
whose
intellectual
independence
will
be
their
greatest
force
who
will
attach
themselves
to
nothing
always
ready
to
accept
what
is
best
happy
in
the
triumph
of
new
ideas
aspiring
to
live
multiple
lives
in
one
life
society
fears
such
men
we
therefore
must
not
hope
that
it
will
ever
want
an
education
able
to
give
them
to
us
we
shall
follow
the
labors
of
the
scientists
who
study
the
child
with
the
greatest
attention
and
we
shall
eagerly
seek
for
means
of
applying
their
experience
to
the
education
which
we
want
to
build
up
in
the
direction
of
an
ever
fuller
liberation
of
the
individual
but
how
can
we
attain
our
end
shall
it
not
be
by
putting
ourselves
directly
to
the
work
favoring
the
foundation
of
new
schools
which
shall
be
ruled
as
much
as
possible
by
this
spirit
of
liberty
which
we
forefeel
will
dominate
the
entire
work
of
education
in
the
future
a
trial
has
been
made
which
for
the
present
has
already
given
excellent
results
we
can
destroy
all
which
in
the
present
school
answers
to
the
organization
of
constraint
the
artificial
surroundings
by
which
children
are
separated
from
nature
and
life
the
intellectual
and
moral
discipline
made
use
of
to
impose
ideas
upon
them
beliefs
which
deprave
and
annihilate
natural
bent
without
fear
of
deceiving
ourselves
we
can
restore
the
child
to
the
environment
which
entices
it
the
environment
of
nature
in
which
he
will
be
in
contact
with
all
that
he
loves
and
in
which
impressions
of
life
will
replace
fastidious
if
we
did
no
more
than
that
we
should
already
have
prepared
in
great
part
the
deliverance
of
the
child
in
such
conditions
we
might
already
freely
apply
the
data
of
science
and
labor
most
fruitfully
i
know
very
well
we
could
not
thus
realize
all
our
hopes
that
we
should
often
be
forced
for
lack
of
knowledge
to
employ
undesirable
methods
but
a
certitude
would
sustain
us
in
our
efforts
namely
that
even
without
reaching
our
aim
completely
we
should
do
more
and
better
in
our
still
imperfect
work
than
the
present
school
accomplishes
i
like
the
free
spontaneity
of
a
child
who
knows
nothing
better
than
the
and
intellectual
deformity
of
a
child
who
has
been
subjected
to
our
present
education
had
ferrer
actually
organized
the
riots
had
he
fought
on
the
barricades
had
he
hurled
a
hundred
bombs
he
could
not
have
been
so
dangerous
to
the
catholic
church
and
to
despotism
as
with
his
opposition
to
discipline
and
restraint
discipline
and
restraint
are
they
not
back
of
all
the
evils
in
the
world
slavery
submission
poverty
all
misery
all
social
iniquities
result
from
discipline
and
restraint
indeed
ferrer
was
dangerous
therefore
he
had
to
die
october
thirteenth
in
the
ditch
of
montjuich
yet
who
dare
say
his
death
was
in
vain
in
view
of
the
tempestuous
rise
of
universal
indignation
italy

in
memory
of

of

and
to
organize
modern
schools
all
over
the

in
the
face
of
this
international
revolutionary
wave
who
is
there
to
say
ferrer
died
in
vain
that
death
at

how
wonderful
how
dramatic
it
was
how
it
stirs
the
human
soul
proud
and

the
inner
eye

francisco
ferrer
needed
no
lying
priests
to
give
him
courage
nor
did
he
upbraid
a
phantom
for
forsaking
him
the
consciousness
that

the
hypocrisy
of
puritanism
speaking
of
puritanism
in
relation
to
american
art
gutzen
burglum
said
puritanism
has
made
us
and
hypocritical
for
so
long
that
sincerity
and
reverence
for
what
is
natural
in
our
impulses
have
been
fairly
bred
out
of
us
with
the
result
that
there
can
be
neither
truth
nor
individuality
in
our
art
burglum
might
have
added
that
puritanism
has
made
life
itself
impossible
more
than
art
more
than
estheticism
life
represents
beauty
in
a
thousand
variations
it
is
indeed
a
gigantic
panorama
of
eternal
change
puritanism
on
the
other
hand
rests
on
a
fixed
and
immovable
conception
of
life
it
is
based
on
the
calvinistic
idea
that
life
is
a
curse
imposed
upon
man
by
the
wrath
of
god
in
order
to
redeem
himself
man
must
do
constant
penance
must
repudiate
every
natural
and
healthy
impulse
and
turn
his
back
on
joy
and
beauty
puritanism
celebrated
its
reign
of
terror
in
england
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
destroying
and
crushing
every
manifestation
of
art
and
culture
it
was
the
spirit
of
puritanism
which
robbed
shelley
of
his
children
because
he
would
not
bow
to
the
dicta
of
religion
it
was
the
same
narrow
spirit
which
alienated
byron
from
his
native
land
because
that
great
genius
rebelled
against
the
monotony
dullness
and
pettiness
of
his
country
it
was
puritanism
too
that
forced
some
of
england
freest
women
into
the
conventional
lie
of
marriage
mary
wollstonecraft
and
later
george
eliot
and
recently
puritanism
has
demanded
another
toll
the
life
of
oscar
wilde
in
fact
puritanism
has
never
ceased
to
be
the
most
pernicious
factor
in
the
domain
of
john
bull
acting
as
censor
of
the
artistic
expression
of
his
people
and
stamping
its
approval
only
on
the
dullness
of
respectability
it
is
therefore
sheer
british
jingoism
which
points
to
america
as
the
country
of
puritanic
provincialism
it
is
quite
true
that
our
life
is
stunted
by
puritanism
and
that
the
latter
is
killing
what
is
natural
and
healthy
in
our
impulses
but
it
is
equally
true
that
it
is
to
england
that
we
are
indebted
for
transplanting
this
spirit
on
american
soil
it
was
bequeathed
to
us
by
the
pilgrim
fathers
fleeing
from
persecution
and
oppression
the
pilgrims
of
mayflower
fame
established
in
the
new
world
a
reign
of
puritanic
tyranny
and
crime
the
history
of
new
england
and
especially
of
massachusetts
is
full
of
the
horrors
that
have
turned
life
into
gloom
joy
into
despair
naturalness
into
disease
honesty
and
truth
into
hideous
lies
and
hypocrisies
the
and
whipping
post
as
well
as
numerous
other
devices
of
torture
were
the
favorite
english
methods
for
american
purification
boston
the
city
of
culture
has
gone
down
in
the
annals
of
puritanism
as
the
bloody
town
it
rivaled
salem
even
in
her
cruel
persecution
of
unauthorized
religious
opinions
on
the
now
famous
common
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
was
publicly
whipped
for
the
crime
of
free
speech
and
on
the
same
spot
mary
dyer
another
quaker
woman
was
hanged
in
in
fact
boston
has
been
the
scene
of
more
than
one
wanton
crime
committed
by
puritanism
salem
in
the
summer
of
killed
eighteen
people
for
witchcraft
nor
was
massachusetts
alone
in
driving
out
the
devil
by
fire
and
brimstone
as
canning
justly
said
the
pilgrim
fathers
infested
the
new
world
to
redress
the
balance
of
the
old
the
horrors
of
that
period
have
found
their
most
supreme
expression
in
the
american
classic
the
scarlet
letter
puritanism
no
longer
employs
the
thumbscrew
and
lash
but
it
still
has
a
most
pernicious
hold
on
the
minds
and
feelings
of
the
american
people
naught
else
can
explain
the
power
of
a
comstock
like
the
torquemadas
of
days
anthony
comstock
is
the
autocrat
of
american
morals
he
dictates
the
standards
of
good
and
evil
of
purity
and
vice
like
a
thief
in
the
night
he
sneaks
into
the
private
lives
of
the
people
into
their
most
intimate
relations
the
system
of
espionage
established
by
this
man
comstock
puts
to
shame
the
infamous
third
division
of
the
russian
secret
police
why
does
the
public
tolerate
such
an
outrage
on
its
liberties
simply
because
comstock
is
but
the
loud
expression
of
the
puritanism
bred
in
the
blood
and
from
whose
thraldom
even
liberals
have
not
succeeded
in
fully
emancipating
themselves
the
visionless
and
leaden
elements
of
the
old
young
men
and
women
christian
temperance
unions
purity
leagues
american
sabbath
unions
and
the
prohibition
party
with
anthony
comstock
as
their
patron
saint
are
the
grave
diggers
of
american
art
and
culture
europe
can
at
least
boast
of
a
bold
art
and
literature
which
delve
deeply
into
the
social
and
sexual
problems
of
our
time
exercising
a
severe
critique
of
all
our
shams
as
with
a
surgeon
knife
every
puritanic
carcass
is
dissected
and
the
way
thus
cleared
for
liberation
from
the
dead
weights
of
the
past
but
with
puritanism
as
the
constant
check
upon
american
life
neither
truth
nor
sincerity
is
possible
nothing
but
gloom
and
mediocrity
to
dictate
human
conduct
curtail
natural
expression
and
stifle
our
best
impulses
puritanism
in
this
the
twentieth
century
is
as
much
the
enemy
of
freedom
and
beauty
as
it
was
when
it
landed
on
plymouth
rock
it
repudiates
as
something
vile
and
sinful
our
deepest
feelings
but
being
absolutely
ignorant
as
to
the
real
functions
of
human
emotions
puritanism
is
itself
the
creator
of
the
most
unspeakable
vices
the
entire
history
of
asceticism
proves
this
to
be
only
too
true
the
church
as
well
as
puritanism
has
fought
the
flesh
as
something
evil
it
had
to
be
subdued
and
hidden
at
all
cost
the
result
of
this
vicious
attitude
is
only
now
beginning
to
be
recognized
by
modern
thinkers
and
educators
they
realize
that
nakedness
has
a
hygienic
value
as
well
as
a
spiritual
significance
far
beyond
its
influences
in
allaying
the
natural
inquisitiveness
of
the
young
or
acting
as
a
preventative
of
morbid
emotion
it
is
an
inspiration
to
adults
who
have
long
outgrown
any
youthful
curiosities
the
vision
of
the
essential
and
eternal
human
form
the
nearest
thing
to
us
in
all
the
world
with
its
vigor
and
its
beauty
and
its
grace
is
one
of
the
prime
tonics
of
life
but
the
spirit
of
purism
has
so
perverted
the
human
mind
that
it
has
lost
the
power
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
nudity
forcing
us
to
hide
the
natural
form
under
the
plea
of
chastity
yet
chastity
itself
is
but
an
artificial
imposition
upon
nature
expressive
of
a
false
shame
of
the
human
form
the
modern
idea
of
chastity
especially
in
reference
to
woman
its
greatest
victim
is
but
the
sensuous
exaggeration
of
our
natural
impulses
chastity
varies
with
the
amount
of
clothing
and
hence
christians
and
purists
forever
hasten
to
cover
the
heathen
with
tatters
and
thus
convert
him
to
goodness
and
chastity
puritanism
with
its
perversion
of
the
significance
and
functions
of
the
human
body
especially
in
regard
to
woman
has
condemned
her
to
celibacy
or
to
the
indiscriminate
breeding
of
a
diseased
race
or
to
prostitution
the
enormity
of
this
crime
against
humanity
is
apparent
when
we
consider
the
results
absolute
sexual
continence
is
imposed
upon
the
unmarried
woman
under
pain
of
being
considered
immoral
or
fallen
with
the
result
of
producing
neurasthenia
impotence
depression
and
a
great
variety
of
nervous
complaints
involving
diminished
power
of
work
limited
enjoyment
of
life
sleeplessness
and
preoccupation
with
sexual
desires
and
imaginings
the
arbitrary
and
pernicious
dictum
of
total
continence
probably
also
explains
the
mental
inequality
of
the
sexes
thus
freud
believes
that
the
intellectual
inferiority
of
so
many
women
is
due
to
the
inhibition
of
thought
imposed
upon
them
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
repression
having
thus
suppressed
the
natural
sex
desires
of
the
unmarried
woman
puritanism
on
the
other
hand
blesses
her
married
sister
for
incontinent
fruitfulness
in
wedlock
indeed
not
merely
blesses
her
but
forces
the
woman
oversexed
by
previous
repression
to
bear
children
irrespective
of
weakened
physical
condition
or
economic
inability
to
rear
a
large
family
prevention
even
by
scientifically
determined
safe
methods
is
absolutely
prohibited
nay
the
very
mention
of
the
subject
is
considered
criminal
thanks
to
this
puritanic
tyranny
the
majority
of
women
soon
find
themselves
at
the
ebb
of
their
physical
resources
ill
and
worn
they
are
utterly
unable
to
give
their
children
even
elementary
care
that
added
to
economic
pressure
forces
many
women
to
risk
utmost
danger
rather
than
continue
to
bring
forth
life
the
custom
of
procuring
abortions
has
reached
such
vast
proportions
in
america
as
to
be
almost
beyond
belief
according
to
recent
investigations
along
this
line
seventeen
abortions
are
committed
in
every
hundred
pregnancies
this
fearful
percentage
represents
only
cases
which
come
to
the
knowledge
of
physicians
considering
the
secrecy
in
which
this
practice
is
necessarily
shrouded
and
the
consequent
professional
inefficiency
and
neglect
puritanism
continuously
exacts
thousands
of
victims
to
its
own
stupidity
and
hypocrisy
prostitution
although
hounded
imprisoned
and
chained
is
nevertheless
the
greatest
triumph
of
puritanism
it
is
its
most
cherished
child
all
hypocritical
sanctimoniousness
notwithstanding
the
prostitute
is
the
fury
of
our
century
sweeping
across
the
civilized
countries
like
a
hurricane
and
leaving
a
trail
of
disease
and
disaster
the
only
remedy
puritanism
offers
for
this
child
is
greater
repression
and
more
merciless
persecution
the
latest
outrage
is
represented
by
the
page
law
which
imposes
upon
new
york
the
terrible
failure
and
crime
of
europe
namely
registration
and
segregation
of
the
unfortunate
victims
of
puritanism
in
equally
stupid
manner
purism
seeks
to
check
the
terrible
scourge
of
its
own
creation
venereal
diseases
most
disheartening
it
is
that
this
spirit
of
obtuse
has
poisoned
even
our
liberals
and
has
blinded
them
into
joining
the
crusade
against
the
very
things
born
of
the
hypocrisy
of
puritanism
prostitution
and
its
results
in
wilful
blindness
puritanism
refuses
to
see
that
the
true
method
of
prevention
is
the
one
which
makes
it
clear
to
all
that
venereal
diseases
are
not
a
mysterious
or
terrible
thing
the
penalty
of
the
sin
of
the
flesh
a
sort
of
shameful
evil
branded
by
purist
malediction
but
an
ordinary
disease
which
may
be
treated
and
cured
by
its
methods
of
obscurity
disguise
and
concealment
puritanism
has
furnished
favorable
conditions
for
the
growth
and
spread
of
these
diseases
its
bigotry
is
again
most
strikingly
demonstrated
by
the
senseless
attitude
in
regard
to
the
great
discovery
of
ehrlich
hypocrisy
veiling
the
important
cure
for
syphilis
with
vague
allusions
to
a
remedy
for
a
certain
poison
the
almost
limitless
capacity
of
puritanism
for
evil
is
due
to
its
intrenchment
behind
the
state
and
the
law
pretending
to
safeguard
the
people
against
immorality
it
has
impregnated
the
machinery
of
government
and
added
to
its
usurpation
of
moral
guardianship
the
legal
censorship
of
our
views
feelings
and
even
of
our
conduct
art
literature
the
drama
the
privacy
of
the
mails
in
fact
our
most
intimate
tastes
are
at
the
mercy
of
this
inexorable
tyrant
anthony
comstock
or
some
other
equally
ignorant
policeman
has
been
given
power
to
desecrate
genius
to
soil
and
mutilate
the
sublimest
creation
of
nature
the
human
form
books
dealing
with
the
most
vital
issues
of
our
lives
and
seeking
to
shed
light
upon
dangerously
obscured
problems
are
legally
treated
as
criminal
offenses
and
their
helpless
authors
thrown
into
prison
or
driven
to
destruction
and
death
not
even
in
the
domain
of
the
tsar
is
personal
liberty
daily
outraged
to
the
extent
it
is
in
america
the
stronghold
of
the
puritanic
eunuchs
here
the
only
day
of
recreation
left
to
the
masses
sunday
has
been
made
hideous
and
utterly
impossible
all
writers
on
primitive
customs
and
ancient
civilization
agree
that
the
sabbath
was
a
day
of
festivities
free
from
care
and
duties
a
day
of
general
rejoicing
and
in
every
european
country
this
tradition
continues
to
bring
some
relief
from
the
humdrum
and
stupidity
of
our
christian
era
everywhere
concert
halls
theaters
museums
and
gardens
are
filled
with
men
women
and
children
particularly
workers
with
their
families
full
of
life
and
joy
forgetful
of
the
ordinary
rules
and
conventions
of
their
existence
it
is
on
that
day
that
the
masses
demonstrate
what
life
might
really
mean
in
a
sane
society
with
work
stripped
of
its
purpose
puritanism
has
robbed
the
people
even
of
that
one
day
naturally
only
the
workers
are
affected
our
millionaires
have
their
luxurious
homes
and
elaborate
clubs
the
poor
however
are
condemned
to
the
monotony
and
dullness
of
the
american
sunday
the
sociability
and
fun
of
european
outdoor
life
is
here
exchanged
for
the
gloom
of
the
church
the
stuffy
country
parlor
or
the
brutalizing
atmosphere
of
the
saloon
in
prohibition
states
the
people
lack
even
the
latter
unless
they
can
invest
their
meager
earnings
in
quantities
of
adulterated
liquor
as
to
prohibition
every
one
knows
what
a
farce
it
really
is
like
all
other
achievements
of
puritanism
it
too
has
but
driven
the
devil
deeper
into
the
human
system
nowhere
else
does
one
meet
so
many
drunkards
as
in
our
prohibition
towns
but
so
long
as
one
can
use
scented
candy
to
abate
the
foul
breath
of
hypocrisy
puritanism
is
triumphant
ostensibly
prohibition
is
opposed
to
liquor
for
reasons
of
health
and
economy
but
the
very
spirit
of
prohibition
being
itself
abnormal
it
succeeds
but
in
creating
an
abnormal
life
every
stimulus
which
quickens
the
imagination
and
raises
the
spirits
is
as
necessary
to
our
life
as
air
it
invigorates
the
body
and
deepens
our
vision
of
human
fellowship
without
stimuli
in
one
form
or
another
creative
work
is
impossible
nor
indeed
the
spirit
of
kindliness
and
generosity
the
fact
that
some
great
geniuses
have
seen
their
reflection
in
the
goblet
too
frequently
does
not
justify
puritanism
in
attempting
to
fetter
the
whole
gamut
of
human
emotions
a
byron
and
a
poe
have
stirred
humanity
deeper
than
all
the
puritans
can
ever
hope
to
do
the
former
have
given
to
life
meaning
and
color
the
latter
are
turning
red
blood
into
water
beauty
into
ugliness
variety
into
uniformity
and
decay
puritanism
in
whatever
expression
is
a
poisonous
germ
on
the
surface
everything
may
look
strong
and
vigorous
yet
the
poison
works
its
way
persistently
until
the
entire
fabric
is
doomed
with
hippolyte
taine
every
truly
free
spirit
has
come
to
realize
that
puritanism
is
the
death
of
culture
philosophy
humor
and
good
fellowship
its
characteristics
are
dullness
monotony
and
gloom
the
psychology
of
sex
havelock
ellis
the
traffic
in
women
our
reformers
have
suddenly
made
a
great
discovery
the
white
slave
traffic
the
papers
are
full
of
these
unheard
of
conditions
and
lawmakers
are
already
planning
a
new
set
of
laws
to
check
the
horror
it
is
significant
that
whenever
the
public
mind
is
to
be
diverted
from
a
great
social
wrong
a
crusade
is
inaugurated
against
indecency
gambling
saloons
etc
and
what
is
the
result
of
such
crusades
gambling
is
increasing
saloons
are
doing
a
lively
business
through
back
entrances
prostitution
is
at
its
height
and
the
system
of
pimps
and
cadets
is
but
aggravated
how
is
it
that
an
institution
known
almost
to
every
child
should
have
been
discovered
so
suddenly
how
is
it
that
this
evil
known
to
all
sociologists
should
now
be
made
such
an
important
issue
to
assume
that
the
recent
investigation
of
the
white
slave
traffic
and
by
the
way
a
very
superficial
investigation
has
discovered
anything
new
is
to
say
the
least
very
foolish
prostitution
has
been
and
is
a
widespread
evil
yet
mankind
goes
on
its
business
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
sufferings
and
distress
of
the
victims
of
prostitution
as
indifferent
indeed
as
mankind
has
remained
to
our
industrial
system
or
to
economic
prostitution
only
when
human
sorrows
are
turned
into
a
toy
with
glaring
colors
will
baby
people
become
interested
for
a
while
at
least
the
people
are
a
very
fickle
baby
that
must
have
new
toys
every
day
the
righteous
cry
against
the
white
slave
traffic
is
such
a
toy
it
serves
to
amuse
the
people
for
a
little
while
and
it
will
help
to
create
a
few
more
fat
political
jobs
parasites
who
stalk
about
the
world
as
inspectors
investigators
detectives
and
so
forth
what
is
really
the
cause
of
the
trade
in
women
not
merely
white
women
but
yellow
and
black
women
as
well
exploitation
of
course
the
merciless
moloch
of
capitalism
that
fattens
on
underpaid
labor
thus
driving
thousands
of
women
and
girls
into
prostitution
with
warren
these
girls
feel
why
waste
your
life
working
for
a
few
shillings
a
week
in
a
scullery
eighteen
hours
a
day
naturally
our
reformers
say
nothing
about
this
cause
they
know
it
well
enough
but
it
does
pay
to
say
anything
about
it
it
is
much
more
profitable
to
play
the
pharisee
to
pretend
an
outraged
morality
than
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
however
there
is
one
commendable
exception
among
the
young
writers
reginald
wright
kauffman
whose
work
the
house
of
bondage
is
the
first
earnest
attempt
to
treat
the
social
evil
not
from
a
sentimental
philistine
viewpoint
a
journalist
of
wide
experience
kauffman
proves
that
our
industrial
system
leaves
most
women
no
alternative
except
prostitution
the
women
portrayed
in
the
house
of
bondage
belong
to
the
working
class
had
the
author
portrayed
the
life
of
women
in
other
spheres
he
would
have
been
confronted
with
the
same
state
of
affairs
nowhere
is
woman
treated
according
to
the
merit
of
her
work
but
rather
as
a
sex
it
is
therefore
almost
inevitable
that
she
should
pay
for
her
right
to
exist
to
keep
a
position
in
whatever
line
with
sex
favors
thus
it
is
merely
a
question
of
degree
whether
she
sells
herself
to
one
man
in
or
out
of
marriage
or
to
many
men
whether
our
reformers
admit
it
or
not
the
economic
and
social
inferiority
of
woman
is
responsible
for
prostitution
just
at
present
our
good
people
are
shocked
by
the
disclosures
that
in
new
york
city
alone
one
out
of
every
ten
women
works
in
a
factory
that
the
average
wage
received
by
women
is
six
dollars
per
week
for
to
sixty
hours
of
work
and
that
the
majority
of
female
wage
workers
face
many
months
of
idleness
which
leaves
the
average
wage
about
a
year
in
view
of
these
economic
horrors
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
prostitution
and
the
white
slave
trade
have
become
such
dominant
factors
lest
the
preceding
figures
be
considered
an
exaggeration
it
is
well
to
examine
what
some
authorities
on
prostitution
have
to
say
a
prolific
cause
of
female
depravity
can
be
found
in
the
several
tables
showing
the
description
of
the
employment
pursued
and
the
wages
received
by
the
women
previous
to
their
fall
and
it
will
be
a
question
for
the
political
economist
to
decide
how
far
mere
business
consideration
should
be
an
apology
on
the
part
of
employers
for
a
reduction
in
their
rates
of
remuneration
and
whether
the
savings
of
a
small
percentage
on
wages
is
not
more
than
by
the
enormous
amount
of
taxation
enforced
on
the
public
at
large
to
defray
the
expenses
incurred
on
account
of
a
system
of
vice
which
is
the
direct
result
in
many
cases
of
insufficient
compensation
of
honest
labor
our
reformers
would
do
well
to
look
into
book
there
they
will
find
that
out
of
cases
under
his
observation
but
few
came
from
the
middle
classes
from
conditions
or
pleasant
homes
by
far
the
largest
majority
were
working
girls
and
working
women
some
driven
into
prostitution
through
sheer
want
others
because
of
a
cruel
wretched
life
at
home
others
again
because
of
thwarted
and
crippled
physical
natures
of
which
i
shall
speak
later
on
also
it
will
do
the
maintainers
of
purity
and
morality
good
to
learn
that
out
of
two
thousand
cases
were
married
women
women
who
lived
with
their
husbands
evidently
there
was
not
much
of
a
guaranty
for
their
safety
and
purity
in
the
sanctity
of
marriage
alfred
blaschko
in
prostitution
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
even
more
emphatic
in
characterizing
economic
conditions
as
one
of
the
most
vital
factors
of
prostitution
although
prostitution
has
existed
in
all
ages
it
was
left
to
the
nineteenth
century
to
develop
it
into
a
gigantic
social
institution
the
development
of
industry
with
vast
masses
of
people
in
the
competitive
market
the
growth
and
congestion
of
large
cities
the
insecurity
and
uncertainty
of
employment
has
given
prostitution
an
impetus
never
dreamed
of
at
any
period
in
human
history
and
again
havelock
ellis
while
not
so
absolute
in
dealing
with
the
economic
cause
is
nevertheless
compelled
to
admit
that
it
is
indirectly
and
directly
the
main
cause
thus
he
finds
that
a
large
percentage
of
prostitutes
is
recruited
from
the
servant
class
although
the
latter
have
less
care
and
greater
security
on
the
other
hand
ellis
does
not
deny
that
the
daily
routine
the
drudgery
the
monotony
of
the
servant
girl
lot
and
especially
the
fact
that
she
may
never
partake
of
the
companionship
and
joy
of
a
home
is
no
mean
factor
in
forcing
her
to
seek
recreation
and
forgetfulness
in
the
gaiety
and
glimmer
of
prostitution
in
other
words
the
servant
girl
being
treated
as
a
drudge
never
having
the
right
to
herself
and
worn
out
by
the
caprices
of
her
mistress
can
find
an
outlet
like
the
factory
or
shopgirl
only
in
prostitution
the
most
amusing
side
of
the
question
now
before
the
public
is
the
indignation
of
our
good
respectable
people
especially
the
various
christian
gentlemen
who
are
always
to
be
found
in
the
front
ranks
of
every
crusade
is
it
that
they
are
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
history
of
religion
and
especially
of
the
christian
religion
or
is
it
that
they
hope
to
blind
the
present
generation
to
the
part
played
in
the
past
by
the
church
in
relation
to
prostitution
whatever
their
reason
they
should
be
the
last
to
cry
out
against
the
unfortunate
victims
of
today
since
it
is
known
to
every
intelligent
student
that
prostitution
is
of
religious
origin
maintained
and
fostered
for
many
centuries
not
as
a
shame
but
as
a
virtue
hailed
as
such
by
the
gods
themselves
it
would
seem
that
the
origin
of
prostitution
is
to
be
found
primarily
in
a
religious
custom
religion
the
great
conserver
of
social
tradition
preserving
in
a
transformed
shape
a
primitive
freedom
that
was
passing
out
of
the
general
social
life
the
typical
example
is
that
recorded
by
herodotus
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
at
the
temple
of
mylitta
the
babylonian
venus
where
every
woman
once
in
her
life
had
to
come
and
give
herself
to
the
first
stranger
who
threw
a
coin
in
her
lap
to
worship
the
goddess
very
similar
customs
existed
in
other
parts
of
western
asia
in
north
africa
in
cyprus
and
other
islands
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
and
also
in
greece
where
the
temple
of
aphrodite
on
the
fort
at
corinth
possessed
over
a
thousand
hierodules
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
goddess
the
theory
that
religious
prostitution
developed
as
a
general
rule
out
of
the
belief
that
the
generative
activity
of
human
beings
possessed
a
mysterious
and
sacred
influence
in
promoting
the
fertility
of
nature
is
maintained
by
all
authoritative
writers
on
the
subject
gradually
however
and
when
prostitution
became
an
organized
institution
under
priestly
influence
religious
prostitution
developed
utilitarian
sides
thus
helping
to
increase
public
revenue
the
rise
of
christianity
to
political
power
produced
little
change
in
policy
the
leading
fathers
of
the
church
tolerated
prostitution
brothels
under
municipal
protection
are
found
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
constituted
a
sort
of
public
service
the
directors
of
them
being
considered
almost
as
public
servants
to
this
must
be
added
the
following
from
sanger
work
pope
clement
ii
issued
a
bull
that
prostitutes
would
be
tolerated
if
they
pay
a
certain
amount
of
their
earnings
to
the
church
pope
sixtus
iv
was
more
practical
from
one
single
brothel
which
he
himself
had
built
he
received
an
income
of
ducats
in
modern
times
the
church
is
a
little
more
careful
in
that
direction
at
least
she
does
not
openly
demand
tribute
from
prostitutes
she
finds
it
much
more
profitable
to
go
in
for
real
estate
like
trinity
church
for
instance
to
rent
out
death
traps
at
an
exorbitant
price
to
those
who
live
off
and
by
prostitution
much
as
i
should
like
to
my
space
will
not
admit
speaking
of
prostitution
in
egypt
greece
rome
and
during
the
middle
ages
the
conditions
in
the
latter
period
are
particularly
interesting
inasmuch
as
prostitution
was
organized
into
guilds
presided
over
by
a
brothel
queen
these
guilds
employed
strikes
as
a
medium
of
improving
their
condition
and
keeping
a
standard
price
certainly
that
is
more
practical
a
method
than
the
one
used
by
the
modern
wage
slave
in
society
it
would
be
and
extremely
superficial
to
maintain
that
the
economic
factor
is
the
only
cause
of
prostitution
there
are
others
no
less
important
and
vital
that
too
our
reformers
know
but
dare
discuss
even
less
than
the
institution
that
saps
the
very
life
out
of
both
men
and
women
i
refer
to
the
sex
question
the
very
mention
of
which
causes
most
people
moral
spasms
it
is
a
conceded
fact
that
woman
is
being
reared
as
a
sex
commodity
and
yet
she
is
kept
in
absolute
ignorance
of
the
meaning
and
importance
of
sex
everything
dealing
with
the
subject
is
suppressed
and
persons
who
attempt
to
bring
light
into
this
terrible
darkness
are
persecuted
and
thrown
into
prison
yet
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
so
long
as
a
girl
is
not
to
know
how
to
take
care
of
herself
not
to
know
the
function
of
the
most
important
part
of
her
life
we
need
not
be
surprised
if
she
becomes
an
easy
prey
to
prostitution
or
to
any
other
form
of
a
relationship
which
degrades
her
to
the
position
of
an
object
for
mere
sex
gratification
it
is
due
to
this
ignorance
that
the
entire
life
and
nature
of
the
girl
is
thwarted
and
crippled
we
have
long
ago
taken
it
as
a
fact
that
the
boy
may
follow
the
call
of
the
wild
that
is
to
say
that
the
boy
may
as
soon
has
his
sex
nature
asserts
itself
satisfy
that
nature
but
our
moralists
are
scandalized
at
the
very
thought
that
the
nature
of
a
girl
should
assert
itself
to
the
moralist
prostitution
does
not
consist
so
much
in
the
fact
that
the
woman
sells
her
body
but
rather
that
she
sells
it
out
of
wedlock
that
this
is
no
mere
statement
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
marriage
for
monetary
considerations
is
perfectly
legitimate
sanctified
by
law
and
public
opinion
while
any
other
union
is
condemned
and
repudiated
yet
a
prostitute
if
properly
defined
means
nothing
else
than
any
person
for
whom
sexual
relationships
are
subordinated
to
gain
those
women
are
prostitutes
who
sell
their
bodies
for
the
exercise
of
the
sexual
act
and
make
of
this
a
profession
in
fact
banger
goes
further
he
maintains
that
the
act
of
prostitution
is
intrinsically
equal
to
that
of
a
man
or
woman
who
contracts
a
marriage
for
economic
reasons
of
course
marriage
is
the
goal
of
every
girl
but
as
thousands
of
girls
can
not
marry
our
stupid
social
customs
condemn
them
either
to
a
life
of
celibacy
or
prostitution
human
nature
asserts
itself
regardless
of
all
laws
nor
is
there
any
plausible
reason
why
nature
should
adapt
itself
to
a
perverted
conception
of
morality
society
considers
the
sex
experiences
of
a
man
as
attributes
of
his
general
development
while
similar
experiences
in
the
life
of
a
woman
are
looked
upon
as
a
terrible
calamity
a
loss
of
honor
and
of
all
that
is
good
and
noble
in
a
human
being
this
double
standard
of
morality
has
played
no
little
part
in
the
creation
and
perpetuation
of
prostitution
it
involves
the
keeping
of
the
young
in
absolute
ignorance
on
sex
matters
which
alleged
innocence
together
with
an
overwrought
and
stifled
sex
nature
helps
to
bring
about
a
state
of
affairs
that
our
puritans
are
so
anxious
to
avoid
or
prevent
not
that
the
gratification
of
sex
must
needs
lead
to
prostitution
it
is
the
cruel
heartless
criminal
persecution
of
those
who
dare
divert
from
the
beaten
paths
which
is
responsible
for
it
girls
mere
children
work
in
crowded
rooms
ten
to
twelve
hours
daily
at
a
machine
which
tends
to
keep
them
in
a
constant
sex
state
many
of
these
girls
have
no
home
or
comforts
of
any
kind
therefore
the
street
or
some
place
of
cheap
amusement
is
the
only
means
of
forgetting
their
daily
routine
this
naturally
brings
them
into
close
proximity
with
the
other
sex
it
is
hard
to
say
which
of
the
two
factors
brings
the
girl
condition
to
a
climax
but
it
is
certainly
the
most
natural
thing
that
a
climax
should
result
that
is
the
first
step
toward
prostitution
nor
is
the
girl
to
be
held
responsible
for
it
on
the
contrary
it
is
altogether
the
fault
of
society
the
fault
of
our
lack
of
understanding
of
our
lack
of
appreciation
of
life
in
the
making
especially
is
it
the
criminal
fault
of
our
moralists
who
condemn
a
girl
for
all
eternity
because
she
has
gone
from
the
path
of
virtue
that
is
because
her
first
sex
experience
has
taken
place
without
the
sanction
of
the
church
the
girl
feels
herself
a
complete
outcast
with
the
doors
of
home
and
society
closed
in
her
face
her
entire
training
and
tradition
is
such
that
the
girl
herself
feels
depraved
and
fallen
and
therefore
has
no
ground
to
stand
upon
or
any
hold
that
will
lift
her
up
instead
of
dragging
her
down
thus
society
creates
the
victims
that
it
afterwards
vainly
attempts
to
get
rid
of
the
meanest
most
depraved
and
decrepit
man
still
considers
himself
too
good
to
take
as
his
wife
the
woman
whose
grace
he
was
quite
willing
to
buy
even
though
he
might
thereby
save
her
from
a
life
of
horror
nor
can
she
turn
to
her
own
sister
for
help
in
her
stupidity
the
latter
deems
herself
too
pure
and
chaste
not
realizing
that
her
own
position
is
in
many
respects
even
more
deplorable
than
her
sister
of
the
street
the
wife
who
married
for
money
compared
with
the
prostitute
says
havelock
ellis
is
the
true
scab
she
is
paid
less
gives
much
more
in
return
in
labor
and
care
and
is
absolutely
bound
to
her
master
the
prostitute
never
signs
away
the
right
over
her
own
person
she
retains
her
freedom
and
personal
rights
nor
is
she
always
compelled
to
submit
to
a
man
embrace
nor
does
the
woman
realize
the
apologist
claim
of
lecky
that
though
she
may
be
the
supreme
type
of
vice
she
is
also
the
most
efficient
guardian
of
virtue
but
for
her
happy
homes
would
be
polluted
unnatural
and
harmful
practice
would
abound
moralists
are
ever
ready
to
sacrifice
of
the
human
race
for
the
sake
of
some
miserable
institution
which
they
can
not
outgrow
as
a
matter
of
fact
prostitution
is
no
more
a
safeguard
for
the
purity
of
the
home
than
rigid
laws
are
a
safeguard
against
prostitution
fully
fifty
per
cent
of
married
men
are
patrons
of
brothels
it
is
through
this
virtuous
element
that
the
married
women
nay
even
the
children
are
infected
with
venereal
diseases
yet
society
has
not
a
word
of
condemnation
for
the
man
while
no
law
is
too
monstrous
to
be
set
in
motion
against
the
helpless
victim
she
is
not
only
preyed
upon
by
those
who
use
her
but
she
is
also
absolutely
at
the
mercy
of
every
policeman
and
miserable
detective
on
the
beat
the
officials
at
the
station
house
the
authorities
in
every
prison
in
a
recent
book
by
a
woman
who
was
for
twelve
years
the
mistress
of
a
house
are
to
be
found
the
following
figures
the
authorities
compelled
me
to
pay
every
month
fines
between
to
the
girls
would
pay
from
to
to
the
police
considering
that
the
writer
did
her
business
in
a
small
city
that
the
amounts
she
gives
do
not
include
extra
bribes
and
fines
one
can
readily
see
the
tremendous
revenue
the
police
department
derives
from
the
blood
money
of
its
victims
whom
it
will
not
even
protect
woe
to
those
who
refuse
to
pay
their
toll
they
would
be
rounded
up
like
cattle
if
only
to
make
a
favorable
impression
upon
the
good
citizens
of
the
city
or
if
the
powers
needed
extra
money
on
the
side
for
the
warped
mind
who
believes
that
a
fallen
woman
is
incapable
of
human
emotion
it
would
be
impossible
to
realize
the
grief
the
disgrace
the
tears
the
wounded
pride
that
was
ours
every
time
we
were
pulled
in
strange
is
it
that
a
woman
who
has
a
kept
a
house
should
be
able
to
feel
that
way
but
stranger
still
that
a
good
christian
world
should
bleed
and
fleece
such
women
and
give
them
nothing
in
return
except
obloquy
and
persecution
oh
for
the
charity
of
a
christian
world
much
stress
is
laid
on
white
slaves
being
imported
into
america
how
would
america
ever
retain
her
virtue
if
europe
did
not
help
her
out
i
will
not
deny
that
this
may
be
the
case
in
some
instances
any
more
than
i
will
deny
that
there
are
emissaries
of
germany
and
other
countries
luring
economic
slaves
into
america
but
i
absolutely
deny
that
prostitution
is
recruited
to
any
appreciable
extent
from
europe
it
may
be
true
that
the
majority
of
prostitutes
in
new
york
city
are
foreigners
but
that
is
because
the
majority
of
the
population
is
foreign
the
moment
we
go
to
any
other
american
city
to
chicago
or
the
middle
west
we
shall
find
that
the
number
of
foreign
prostitutes
is
by
far
a
minority
equally
exaggerated
is
the
belief
that
the
majority
of
street
girls
in
this
city
were
engaged
in
this
business
before
they
came
to
america
most
of
the
girls
speak
excellent
english
are
americanized
in
habits
and
appearance
a
thing
absolutely
impossible
unless
they
had
lived
in
this
country
many
years
that
is
they
were
driven
into
prostitution
by
american
conditions
by
the
thoroughly
american
custom
for
excessive
display
of
finery
and
clothes
which
of
course
necessitates
money
money
that
can
not
be
earned
in
shops
or
factories
in
other
words
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
set
of
men
would
go
to
the
risk
and
expense
of
getting
foreign
products
when
american
conditions
are
overflooding
the
market
with
thousands
of
girls
on
the
other
hand
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
the
export
of
american
girls
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution
is
by
no
means
a
small
factor
thus
clifford
roe
state
attorney
of
cook
county
makes
the
open
charge
that
new
england
girls
are
shipped
to
panama
for
the
express
use
of
men
in
the
employ
of
uncle
sam
roe
adds
that
there
seems
to
be
an
underground
railroad
between
boston
and
washington
which
many
girls
travel
is
it
not
significant
that
the
railroad
should
lead
to
the
very
seat
of
federal
authority
that
roe
said
more
than
was
desired
in
certain
quarters
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
lost
his
position
it
is
not
practical
for
men
in
office
to
tell
tales
from
school
the
excuse
given
for
the
conditions
in
panama
is
that
there
are
no
brothels
in
the
canal
zone
that
is
the
usual
avenue
of
escape
for
a
hypocritical
world
that
dares
not
face
the
truth
not
in
the
canal
zone
not
in
the
city
limits
therefore
prostitution
does
not
exist
next
to
roe
there
is
james
bronson
reynolds
who
has
made
a
thorough
study
of
the
white
slave
traffic
in
asia
as
a
staunch
american
citizen
and
friend
of
the
future
napoleon
of
america
theodore
roosevelt
he
is
surely
the
last
to
discredit
the
virtue
of
his
country
yet
we
are
informed
by
him
that
in
hong
kong
shanghai
and
yokohama
the
augean
stables
of
american
vice
are
located
there
american
prostitutes
have
made
themselves
so
conspicuous
that
in
the
orient
american
girl
is
synonymous
with
prostitute
reynolds
reminds
his
countrymen
that
while
americans
in
china
are
under
the
protection
of
our
consular
representatives
the
chinese
in
america
have
no
protection
at
all
every
one
who
knows
the
brutal
and
barbarous
persecution
chinese
and
japanese
endure
on
the
pacific
coast
will
agree
with
reynolds
in
view
of
the
above
facts
it
is
rather
absurd
to
point
to
europe
as
the
swamp
whence
come
all
the
social
diseases
of
america
just
as
absurd
is
it
to
proclaim
the
myth
that
the
jews
furnish
the
largest
contingent
of
willing
prey
i
am
sure
that
no
one
will
accuse
me
of
nationalistic
tendencies
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
have
developed
out
of
them
as
out
of
many
other
prejudices
if
therefore
i
resent
the
statement
that
jewish
prostitutes
are
imported
it
is
not
because
of
any
judaistic
sympathies
but
because
of
the
facts
inherent
in
the
lives
of
these
people
no
one
but
the
most
superficial
will
claim
that
jewish
girls
migrate
to
strange
lands
unless
they
have
some
tie
or
relation
that
brings
them
there
the
jewish
girl
is
not
adventurous
until
recent
years
she
had
never
left
home
not
even
so
far
as
the
next
village
or
town
except
it
were
to
visit
some
relative
is
it
then
credible
that
jewish
girls
would
leave
their
parents
or
families
travel
thousands
of
miles
to
strange
lands
through
the
influence
and
promises
of
strange
forces
go
to
any
of
the
large
incoming
steamers
and
see
for
yourself
if
these
girls
do
not
come
either
with
their
parents
brothers
aunts
or
other
kinsfolk
there
may
be
exceptions
of
course
but
to
state
that
large
numbers
of
jewish
girls
are
imported
for
prostitution
or
any
other
purpose
is
simply
not
to
know
jewish
psychology
those
who
sit
in
a
glass
house
do
wrong
to
throw
stones
about
them
besides
the
american
glass
house
is
rather
thin
it
will
break
easily
and
the
interior
is
anything
but
a
gainly
sight
to
ascribe
the
increase
in
prostitution
to
alleged
importation
to
the
growth
of
the
cadet
system
or
similar
causes
is
highly
superficial
i
have
already
referred
to
the
former
as
to
the
cadet
system
abhorrent
as
it
is
we
must
not
ignore
the
fact
that
it
is
essentially
a
phase
of
modern
prostitution
a
phase
accentuated
by
suppression
and
graft
resulting
from
sporadic
crusades
against
the
social
evil
the
procurer
is
no
doubt
a
poor
specimen
of
the
human
family
but
in
what
manner
is
he
more
despicable
than
the
policeman
who
takes
the
last
cent
from
the
street
walker
and
then
locks
her
up
in
the
station
house
why
is
the
cadet
more
criminal
or
a
greater
menace
to
society
than
the
owners
of
department
stores
and
factories
who
grow
fat
on
the
sweat
of
their
victims
only
to
drive
them
to
the
streets
i
make
no
plea
for
the
cadet
but
i
fail
to
see
why
he
should
be
mercilessly
hounded
while
the
real
perpetrators
of
all
social
iniquity
enjoy
immunity
and
respect
then
too
it
is
well
to
remember
that
it
is
not
the
cadet
who
makes
the
prostitute
it
is
our
sham
and
hypocrisy
that
create
both
the
prostitute
and
the
cadet
until
very
little
was
known
in
america
of
the
procurer
then
we
were
attacked
by
an
epidemic
of
virtue
vice
was
to
be
abolished
the
country
purified
at
all
cost
the
social
cancer
was
therefore
driven
out
of
sight
but
deeper
into
the
body
keepers
of
brothels
as
well
as
their
unfortunate
victims
were
turned
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
police
the
inevitable
consequence
of
exorbitant
bribes
and
the
penitentiary
followed
while
comparatively
protected
in
the
brothels
where
they
represented
a
certain
monetary
value
the
girls
now
found
themselves
on
the
street
absolutely
at
the
mercy
of
the
police
desperate
needing
protection
and
longing
for
affection
these
girls
naturally
proved
an
easy
prey
for
cadets
themselves
the
result
of
the
spirit
of
our
commercial
age
thus
the
cadet
system
was
the
direct
outgrowth
of
police
persecution
graft
and
attempted
suppression
of
prostitution
it
were
sheer
folly
to
confound
this
modern
phase
of
the
social
evil
with
the
causes
of
the
latter
mere
suppression
and
barbaric
enactments
can
serve
but
to
embitter
and
further
degrade
the
unfortunate
victims
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
the
latter
has
reached
its
highest
expression
in
the
proposed
law
to
make
humane
treatment
of
prostitutes
a
crime
punishing
any
one
sheltering
a
prostitute
with
five
imprisonment
and
fine
such
an
attitude
merely
exposes
the
terrible
lack
of
understanding
of
the
true
causes
of
prostitution
as
a
social
factor
as
well
as
manifesting
the
puritanic
spirit
of
the
scarlet
letter
days
there
is
not
a
single
modern
writer
on
the
subject
who
does
not
refer
to
the
utter
futility
of
legislative
methods
in
coping
with
the
issue
thus
blaschko
finds
that
governmental
suppression
and
moral
crusades
accomplish
nothing
save
driving
the
evil
into
secret
channels
multiplying
its
dangers
to
society
havelock
ellis
the
most
thorough
and
humane
student
of
prostitution
proves
by
a
wealth
of
data
that
the
more
stringent
the
methods
of
persecution
the
worse
the
condition
becomes
among
other
data
we
learn
that
in
france
in
charles
ix
abolished
brothels
through
an
edict
but
the
numbers
of
prostitutes
were
only
increased
while
many
new
brothels
appeared
in
unsuspected
shapes
and
were
more
dangerous
in
spite
of
all
such
legislation
or
because
of
it
there
has
been
no
country
in
which
prostitution
has
played
a
more
conspicuous
part
an
educated
public
opinion
freed
from
the
legal
and
moral
hounding
of
the
prostitute
can
alone
help
to
ameliorate
present
conditions
wilful
shutting
of
eyes
and
ignoring
of
the
evil
as
a
social
factor
of
modern
life
can
but
aggravate
matters
we
must
rise
above
our
foolish
notions
of
better
than
thou
and
learn
to
recognize
in
the
prostitute
a
product
of
social
conditions
such
a
realization
will
sweep
away
the
attitude
of
hypocrisy
and
insure
a
greater
understanding
and
more
humane
treatment
as
to
a
thorough
eradication
of
prostitution
nothing
can
accomplish
that
save
a
complete
transvaluation
of
all
accepted
values
especially
the
moral
ones
coupled
with
the
abolition
of
industrial
slavery

woman
towards
her
gods
religion
especially
the
christian
religion
has
condemned
woman
to
the
life
of
an
inferior
a
slave
it
has
thwarted
her
nature
and
fettered
her
soul
yet
the
christian
religion
has
no
greater
supporter
none
more
devout
than
woman
indeed
it
is
safe
to
say
that
religion
would
have
long
ceased
to
be
a
factor
in
the
lives
of
the
people
if
it
were
not
for
the
support
it
receives
from
woman
the
most
ardent
churchworkers
the
most
tireless
missionaries
the
world
over
are
women
always
sacrificing
on
the
altar
of
the
gods
that
have
chained
her
spirit
and
enslaved
her
body
the
insatiable
monster
war
robs
woman
of
all
that
is
dear
and
precious
to
her
it
exacts
her
brothers
lovers
sons
and
in
return
gives
her
a
life
of
loneliness
and
despair
yet
the
greatest
supporter
and
worshiper
of
war
is
woman
she
it
is
who
instills
the
love
of
conquest
and
power
into
her
children
she
it
is
who
whispers
the
glories
of
war
into
the
ears
of
her
little
ones
and
who
rocks
her
baby
to
sleep
with
the
tunes
of
trumpets
and
the
noise
of
guns
it
is
woman
too
who
crowns
the
victor
on
his
return
from
the
battlefield
yes
it
is
woman
who
pays
the
highest
price
to
that
insatiable
monster
war
then
there
is
the
home
what
a
terrible
fetich
it
is
how
it
saps
the
very
of
woman
this
modern
prison
with
golden
bars
its
shining
aspect
blinds
woman
to
the
price
she
would
have
to
pay
as
wife
mother
and
housekeeper
yet
woman
clings
tenaciously
to
the
home
to
the
power
that
holds
her
in
bondage
it
may
be
said
that
because
woman
recognizes
the
awful
toll
she
is
made
to
pay
to
the
church
state
and
the
home
she
wants
suffrage
to
set
herself
free
that
may
be
true
of
the
few
the
majority
of
suffragists
repudiate
utterly
such
blasphemy
on
the
contrary
they
insist
always
that
it
is
woman
suffrage
which
will
make
her
a
better
christian
and
homekeeper
a
staunch
citizen
of
the
state
thus
suffrage
is
only
a
means
of
strengthening
the
omnipotence
of
the
very
gods
that
woman
has
served
from
time
immemorial
what
wonder
then
that
she
should
be
just
as
devout
just
as
zealous
just
as
prostrate
before
the
new
idol
woman
suffrage
as
of
old
she
endures
persecution
imprisonment
torture
and
all
forms
of
condemnation
with
a
smile
on
her
face
as
of
old
the
most
enlightened
even
hope
for
a
miracle
from
the
twentieth
century
deity
suffrage
life
happiness
joy
freedom
independence
all
that
and
more
is
to
spring
from
suffrage
in
her
blind
devotion
woman
does
not
see
what
people
of
intellect
perceived
fifty
years
ago
that
suffrage
is
an
evil
that
it
has
only
helped
to
enslave
people
that
it
has
but
closed
their
eyes
that
they
may
not
see
how
craftily
they
were
made
to
submit
woman
demand
for
equal
suffrage
is
based
largely
on
the
contention
that
woman
must
have
the
equal
right
in
all
affairs
of
society
no
one
could
possibly
refute
that
if
suffrage
were
a
right
alas
for
the
ignorance
of
the
human
mind
which
can
see
a
right
in
an
imposition
or
is
it
not
the
most
brutal
imposition
for
one
set
of
people
to
make
laws
that
another
set
is
coerced
by
force
to
obey
yet
woman
clamors
for
that
golden
opportunity
that
has
wrought
so
much
misery
in
the
world
and
robbed
man
of
his
integrity
and
an
imposition
which
has
thoroughly
corrupted
the
people
and
made
them
absolute
prey
in
the
hands
of
unscrupulous
politicians
the
poor
stupid
free
american
citizen
free
to
starve
free
to
tramp
the
highways
of
this
great
country
he
enjoys
universal
suffrage
and
by
that
right
he
has
forged
chains
about
his
limbs
the
reward
that
he
receives
is
stringent
labor
laws
prohibiting
the
right
of
boycott
of
picketing
in
fact
of
everything
except
the
right
to
be
robbed
of
the
fruits
of
his
labor
yet
all
these
disastrous
results
of
the
twentieth
century
fetich
have
taught
woman
nothing
but
then
woman
will
purify
politics
we
are
assured
needless
to
say
i
am
not
opposed
to
woman
suffrage
on
the
conventional
ground
that
she
is
not
equal
to
it
i
see
neither
physical
psychological
nor
mental
reasons
why
woman
should
not
have
the
equal
right
to
vote
with
man
but
that
can
not
possibly
blind
me
to
the
absurd
notion
that
woman
will
accomplish
that
wherein
man
has
failed
if
she
would
not
make
things
worse
she
certainly
could
not
make
them
better
to
assume
therefore
that
she
would
succeed
in
purifying
something
which
is
not
susceptible
of
purification
is
to
credit
her
with
supernatural
powers
since
woman
greatest
misfortune
has
been
that
she
was
looked
upon
as
either
angel
or
devil
her
true
salvation
lies
in
being
placed
on
earth
namely
in
being
considered
human
and
therefore
subject
to
all
human
follies
and
mistakes
are
we
then
to
believe
that
two
errors
will
make
a
right
are
we
to
assume
that
the
poison
already
inherent
in
politics
will
be
decreased
if
women
were
to
enter
the
political
arena
the
most
ardent
suffragists
would
hardly
maintain
such
a
folly
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
most
advanced
students
of
universal
suffrage
have
come
to
realize
that
all
existing
systems
of
political
power
are
absurd
and
are
completely
inadequate
to
meet
the
pressing
issues
of
life
this
view
is
also
borne
out
by
a
statement
of
one
who
is
herself
an
ardent
believer
in
woman
suffrage
helen
sumner
in
her
able
work
on
equal
suffrage
she
says
in
colorado
we
find
that
equal
suffrage
serves
to
show
in
the
most
striking
way
the
essential
rottenness
and
degrading
character
of
the
existing
system
of
course
sumner
has
in
mind
a
particular
system
of
voting
but
the
same
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
entire
machinery
of
the
representative
system
with
such
a
basis
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
woman
as
a
political
factor
would
benefit
either
herself
or
the
rest
of
mankind
but
say
our
suffrage
devotees
look
at
the
countries
and
states
where
female
suffrage
exists
see
what
woman
has
accomplished
in
australia
new
zealand
finland
the
scandinavian
countries
and
in
our
own
four
states
idaho
colorado
wyoming
and
utah
distance
lends
enchantment
or
to
quote
a
polish
formula
it
is
well
where
we
are
not
thus
one
would
assume
that
those
countries
and
states
are
unlike
other
countries
or
states
that
they
have
greater
freedom
greater
social
and
economic
equality
a
finer
appreciation
of
human
life
deeper
understanding
of
the
great
social
struggle
with
all
the
vital
questions
it
involves
for
the
human
race
the
women
of
australia
and
new
zealand
can
vote
and
help
make
the
laws
are
the
labor
conditions
better
there
than
they
are
in
england
where
the
suffragettes
are
making
such
a
heroic
struggle
does
there
exist
a
greater
motherhood
happier
and
freer
children
than
in
england
is
woman
there
no
longer
considered
a
mere
sex
commodity
has
she
emancipated
herself
from
the
puritanical
double
standard
of
morality
for
men
and
women
certainly
none
but
the
ordinary
female
stump
politician
will
dare
answer
these
questions
in
the
affirmative
if
that
be
so
it
seems
ridiculous
to
point
to
australia
and
new
zealand
as
the
mecca
of
equal
suffrage
accomplishments
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
fact
to
those
who
know
the
real
political
conditions
in
australia
that
politics
have
gagged
labor
by
enacting
the
most
stringent
labor
laws
making
strikes
without
the
sanction
of
an
arbitration
committee
a
crime
equal
to
treason
not
for
a
moment
do
i
mean
to
imply
that
woman
suffrage
is
responsible
for
this
state
of
affairs
i
do
mean
however
that
there
is
no
reason
to
point
to
australia
as
a
of
woman
accomplishment
since
her
influence
has
been
unable
to
free
labor
from
the
thralldom
of
political
bossism
finland
has
given
woman
equal
suffrage
nay
even
the
right
to
sit
in
parliament
has
that
helped
to
develop
a
greater
heroism
an
intenser
zeal
than
that
of
the
women
of
russia
finland
like
russia
smarts
under
the
terrible
whip
of
the
bloody
tsar
where
are
the
finnish
perovskaias
spiridonovas
figners
breshkovskaias
where
are
the
countless
numbers
of
finnish
young
girls
who
cheerfully
go
to
siberia
for
their
cause
finland
is
sadly
in
need
of
heroic
liberators
why
has
the
ballot
not
created
them
the
only
finnish
avenger
of
his
people
was
a
man
not
a
woman
and
he
used
a
more
effective
weapon
than
the
ballot
as
to
our
own
states
where
women
vote
and
which
are
constantly
being
pointed
out
as
examples
of
marvels
what
has
been
accomplished
there
through
the
ballot
that
women
do
not
to
a
large
extent
enjoy
in
other
states
or
that
they
could
not
achieve
through
energetic
efforts
without
the
ballot
true
in
the
suffrage
states
women
are
guaranteed
equal
rights
to
property
but
of
what
avail
is
that
right
to
the
mass
of
women
without
property
the
thousands
of
wage
workers
who
live
from
hand
to
mouth
that
equal
suffrage
did
not
and
can
not
affect
their
condition
is
admitted
even
by
sumner
who
certainly
is
in
a
position
to
know
as
an
ardent
suffragist
and
having
been
sent
to
colorado
by
the
collegiate
equal
suffrage
league
of
new
york
state
to
collect
material
in
favor
of
suffrage
she
would
be
the
last
to
say
anything
derogatory
yet
we
are
informed
that
equal
suffrage
has
but
slightly
affected
the
economic
conditions
of
women
that
women
do
not
receive
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
that
though
woman
in
colorado
has
enjoyed
school
suffrage
since
women
teachers
are
paid
less
than
in
california
on
the
other
hand
miss
sumner
fails
to
account
for
the
fact
that
although
women
have
had
school
suffrage
for
years
and
equal
suffrage
since
the
census
in
denver
alone
a
few
months
ago
disclosed
the
fact
of
fifteen
thousand
defective
school
children
and
that
too
with
mostly
women
in
the
educational
department
and
also
notwithstanding
that
women
in
colorado
have
passed
the
most
stringent
laws
for
child
and
animal
protection
the
women
of
colorado
have
taken
great
interest
in
the
state
institutions
for
the
care
of
dependent
defective
and
delinquent
children
what
a
horrible
indictment
against
care
and
interest
if
one
city
has
fifteen
thousand
defective
children
what
about
the
glory
of
woman
suffrage
since
it
has
failed
utterly
in
the
most
important
social
issue
the
child
and
where
is
the
superior
sense
of
justice
that
woman
was
to
bring
into
the
political
field
where
was
it
in
when
the
mine
owners
waged
a
guerilla
war
against
the
western
miners
union
when
general
bell
established
a
reign
of
terror
pulling
men
out
of
beds
at
night
kidnapping
them
across
the
border
line
throwing
them
into
bull
pens
declaring
to
hell
with
the
constitution
the
club
is
the
constitution
where
were
the
women
politicians
then
and
why
did
they
not
exercise
the
power
of
their
vote
but
they
did
they
helped
to
defeat
the
most
and
liberal
man
governor
waite
the
latter
had
to
make
way
for
the
tool
of
the
mine
kings
governor
peabody
the
enemy
of
labor
the
tsar
of
colorado
certainly
male
suffrage
could
have
done
nothing
worse
granted
wherein
then
are
the
advantages
to
woman
and
society
from
woman
suffrage
the
assertion
that
woman
will
purify
politics
is
also
but
a
myth
it
is
not
borne
out
by
the
people
who
know
the
political
conditions
of
idaho
colorado
wyoming
and
utah
woman
essentially
a
purist
is
naturally
bigotted
and
relentless
in
her
effort
to
make
others
as
good
as
she
thinks
they
ought
to
be
thus
in
idaho
she
has
disfranchised
her
sister
of
the
street
and
declared
all
women
of
lewd
character
unfit
to
vote
lewd
not
being
interpreted
of
course
as
prostitution
in
marriage
it
goes
without
saying
that
illegal
prostitution
and
gambling
have
been
prohibited
in
this
regard
the
law
must
needs
be
of
feminine
nature
it
always
prohibits
therein
all
laws
are
wonderful
they
go
no
further
but
their
very
tendencies
open
all
the
floodgates
of
hell
prostitution
and
gambling
have
never
done
a
more
flourishing
business
than
since
the
law
has
been
set
against
them
in
colorado
the
puritanism
of
woman
has
expressed
itself
in
a
more
drastic
form
men
of
notoriously
unclean
lives
and
men
connected
with
saloons
have
been
dropped
from
politics
since
women
have
the
vote
could
brother
comstock
do
more
could
all
the
puritan
fathers
have
done
more
i
wonder
how
many
women
realize
the
gravity
of
this
feat
i
wonder
if
they
understand
that
it
is
the
very
thing
which
instead
of
elevating
woman
has
made
her
a
political
spy
a
contemptible
pry
into
the
private
affairs
of
people
not
so
much
for
the
good
of
the
cause
but
because
as
a
colorado
woman
said
they
like
to
get
into
houses
they
have
never
been
in
and
find
out
all
they
can
politically
and
otherwise
yes
and
into
the
human
soul
and
its
minutest
nooks
and
corners
for
nothing
satisfies
the
craving
of
most
women
so
much
as
scandal
and
when
did
she
ever
enjoy
such
opportunities
as
are
hers
the
politician
notoriously
unclean
lives
and
men
connected
with
the
saloons
certainly
the
lady
vote
gatherers
can
not
be
accused
of
much
sense
of
proportion
granting
even
that
these
busybodies
can
decide
whose
lives
are
clean
enough
for
that
eminently
clean
atmosphere
politics
must
it
follow
that
belong
to
the
same
category
unless
it
be
american
hypocrisy
and
bigotry
so
manifest
in
the
principle
of
prohibition
which
sanctions
the
spread
of
drunkenness
among
men
and
women
of
the
rich
class
yet
keeps
vigilant
watch
on
the
only
place
left
to
the
poor
man
if
no
other
reason
narrow
and
purist
attitude
toward
life
makes
her
a
greater
danger
to
liberty
wherever
she
has
political
power
man
has
long
overcome
the
superstitions
that
still
engulf
woman
in
the
economic
competitive
field
man
has
been
compelled
to
exercise
efficiency
judgment
ability
competency
he
therefore
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
measure
everyone
morality
with
a
puritanic
yardstick
in
his
political
activities
too
he
has
not
gone
about
blindfolded
he
knows
that
quantity
and
not
quality
is
the
material
for
the
political
grinding
mill
and
unless
he
is
a
sentimental
reformer
or
an
old
fossil
he
knows
that
politics
can
never
be
anything
but
a
swamp
women
who
are
at
all
conversant
with
the
process
of
politics
know
the
nature
of
the
beast
but
in
their
and
egotism
they
make
themselves
believe
that
they
have
but
to
pet
the
beast
and
he
will
become
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
sweet
and
pure
as
if
women
have
not
sold
their
votes
as
if
women
politicians
can
not
be
bought
if
her
body
can
be
bought
in
return
for
material
consideration
why
not
her
vote
that
it
is
being
done
in
colorado
and
in
other
states
is
not
denied
even
by
those
in
favor
of
woman
suffrage
as
i
have
said
before
woman
narrow
view
of
human
affairs
is
not
the
only
argument
against
her
as
a
politician
superior
to
man
there
are
others
her
economic
parasitism
has
utterly
blurred
her
conception
of
the
meaning
of
equality
she
clamors
for
equal
rights
with
men
yet
we
learn
that
few
women
care
to
canvas
in
undesirable
districts
how
little
equality
means
to
them
compared
with
the
russian
women
who
face
hell
itself
for
their
ideal
woman
demands
the
same
rights
as
man
yet
she
is
indignant
that
her
presence
does
not
strike
him
dead
he
smokes
keeps
his
hat
on
and
does
not
jump
from
his
seat
like
a
flunkey
these
may
be
trivial
things
but
they
are
nevertheless
the
key
to
the
nature
of
american
suffragists
to
be
sure
their
english
sisters
have
outgrown
these
silly
notions
they
have
shown
themselves
equal
to
the
greatest
demands
on
their
character
and
power
of
endurance
all
honor
to
the
heroism
and
sturdiness
of
the
english
suffragettes
thanks
to
their
energetic
aggressive
methods
they
have
proved
an
inspiration
to
some
of
our
own
lifeless
and
spineless
ladies
but
after
all
the
suffragettes
too
are
still
lacking
in
appreciation
of
real
equality
else
how
is
one
to
account
for
the
tremendous
truly
gigantic
effort
set
in
motion
by
those
valiant
fighters
for
a
wretched
little
bill
which
will
benefit
a
handful
of
propertied
ladies
with
absolutely
no
provision
for
the
vast
mass
of
workingwomen
true
as
politicians
they
must
be
opportunists
must
take
half
measures
if
they
can
not
get
all
but
as
intelligent
and
liberal
women
they
ought
to
realize
that
if
the
ballot
is
a
weapon
the
disinherited
need
it
more
than
the
economically
superior
class
and
that
the
latter
already
enjoy
too
much
power
by
virtue
of
their
economic
superiority
the
brilliant
leader
of
the
english
suffragettes
emmeline
pankhurst
herself
admitted
when
on
her
american
lecture
tour
that
there
can
be
no
equality
between
political
superiors
and
inferiors
if
so
how
will
the
workingwoman
of
england
already
inferior
economically
to
the
ladies
who
are
benefited
by
the
shackleton
bill
be
able
to
work
with
their
political
superiors
should
the
bill
pass
is
it
not
probable
that
the
class
of
annie
keeney
so
full
of
zeal
devotion
and
martyrdom
will
be
compelled
to
carry
on
their
backs
their
female
political
bosses
even
as
they
are
carrying
their
economic
masters
they
would
still
have
to
do
it
were
universal
suffrage
for
men
and
women
established
in
england
no
matter
what
the
workers
do
they
are
made
to
pay
always
still
those
who
believe
in
the
power
of
the
vote
show
little
sense
of
justice
when
they
concern
themselves
not
at
all
with
those
whom
as
they
claim
it
might
serve
most
the
american
suffrage
movement
has
been
until
very
recently
altogether
a
parlor
affair
absolutely
detached
from
the
economic
needs
of
the
people
thus
susan
anthony
no
doubt
an
exceptional
type
of
woman
was
not
only
indifferent
but
antagonistic
to
labor
nor
did
she
hesitate
to
manifest
her
antagonism
when
in
she
advised
women
to
take
the
places
of
striking
printers
in
new
york
i
do
not
know
whether
her
attitude
had
changed
before
her
death
there
are
of
course
some
suffragists
who
are
affiliated
with
workingwomen
the
women
trade
union
league
for
instance
but
they
are
a
small
minority
and
their
activities
are
essentially
economic
the
rest
look
upon
toil
as
a
just
provision
of
providence
what
would
become
of
the
rich
if
not
for
the
poor
what
would
become
of
these
idle
parasitic
ladies
who
squander
more
in
a
week
than
their
victims
earn
in
a
year
if
not
for
the
eighty
million
wage
workers
equality
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
few
countries
have
produced
such
arrogance
and
snobbishness
as
america
particularly
this
is
true
of
the
american
woman
of
the
middle
class
she
not
only
considers
herself
the
equal
of
man
but
his
superior
especially
in
her
purity
goodness
and
morality
small
wonder
that
the
american
suffragist
claims
for
her
vote
the
most
miraculous
powers
in
her
exalted
conceit
she
does
not
see
how
truly
enslaved
she
is
not
so
much
by
man
as
by
her
own
silly
notions
and
traditions
suffrage
can
not
ameliorate
that
sad
fact
it
can
only
accentuate
it
as
indeed
it
does
one
of
the
great
american
women
leaders
claims
that
woman
is
entitled
not
only
to
equal
pay
but
that
she
ought
to
be
legally
entitled
even
to
the
pay
of
her
husband
failing
to
support
her
he
should
be
put
in
convict
stripes
and
his
earnings
in
prison
be
collected
by
his
equal
wife
does
not
another
brilliant
exponent
of
the
cause
claim
for
woman
that
her
vote
will
abolish
the
social
evil
which
has
been
fought
in
vain
by
the
collective
efforts
of
the
most
illustrious
minds
the
world
over
it
is
indeed
to
be
regretted
that
the
alleged
creator
of
the
universe
has
already
presented
us
with
his
wonderful
scheme
of
things
else
woman
suffrage
would
surely
enable
woman
to
outdo
him
completely
nothing
is
so
dangerous
as
the
dissection
of
a
fetich
if
we
have
outlived
the
time
when
such
heresy
was
punishable
at
the
stake
we
have
not
outlived
the
narrow
spirit
of
condemnation
of
those
who
dare
differ
with
accepted
notions
therefore
i
shall
probably
be
put
down
as
an
opponent
of
woman
but
that
can
not
deter
me
from
looking
the
question
squarely
in
the
face
i
repeat
what
i
have
said
in
the
beginning
i
do
not
believe
that
woman
will
make
politics
worse
nor
can
i
believe
that
she
could
make
it
better
if
then
she
can
not
improve
on
man
mistakes
why
perpetuate
the
latter
history
may
be
a
compilation
of
lies
nevertheless
it
contains
a
few
truths
and
they
are
the
only
guide
we
have
for
the
future
the
history
of
the
political
activities
of
men
proves
that
they
have
given
him
absolutely
nothing
that
he
could
not
have
achieved
in
a
more
direct
less
costly
and
more
lasting
manner
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
inch
of
ground
he
has
gained
has
been
through
a
constant
fight
a
ceaseless
struggle
for
and
not
through
suffrage
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
assume
that
woman
in
her
climb
to
emancipation
has
been
or
will
be
helped
by
the
ballot
in
the
darkest
of
all
countries
russia
with
her
absolute
despotism
woman
has
become
man
equal
not
through
the
ballot
but
by
her
will
to
be
and
to
do
not
only
has
she
conquered
for
herself
every
avenue
of
learning
and
vocation
but
she
has
won
man
esteem
his
respect
his
comradeship
aye
even
more
than
that
she
has
gained
the
admiration
the
respect
of
the
whole
world
that
too
not
through
suffrage
but
by
her
wonderful
heroism
her
fortitude
her
ability
will
power
and
her
endurance
in
the
struggle
for
liberty
where
are
the
women
in
any
suffrage
country
or
state
that
can
lay
claim
to
such
a
victory
when
we
consider
the
accomplishments
of
woman
in
america
we
find
also
that
something
deeper
and
more
powerful
than
suffrage
has
helped
her
in
the
march
to
emancipation
it
is
just
years
ago
since
a
handful
of
women
at
the
seneca
falls
convention
set
forth
a
few
demands
for
their
right
to
equal
education
with
men
and
access
to
the
various
professions
trades
etc
what
wonderful
accomplishment
what
wonderful
triumphs
who
but
the
most
ignorant
dare
speak
of
woman
as
a
mere
domestic
drudge
who
dare
suggest
that
this
or
that
profession
should
not
be
open
to
her
for
over
sixty
years
she
has
molded
a
new
atmosphere
and
a
new
life
for
herself
she
has
become
a
world
power
in
every
domain
of
human
thought
and
activity
and
all
that
without
suffrage
without
the
right
to
make
laws
without
the
privilege
of
becoming
a
judge
a
jailer
or
an
executioner
yes
i
may
be
considered
an
enemy
of
woman
but
if
i
can
help
her
see
the
light
i
shall
not
complain
the
misfortune
of
woman
is
not
that
she
is
unable
to
do
the
work
of
man
but
that
she
is
wasting
her
life
force
to
outdo
him
with
a
tradition
of
centuries
which
has
left
her
physically
incapable
of
keeping
pace
with
him
oh
i
know
some
have
succeeded
but
at
what
cost
at
what
terrific
cost
the
import
is
not
the
kind
of
work
woman
does
but
rather
the
quality
of
the
work
she
furnishes
she
can
give
suffrage
or
the
ballot
no
new
quality
nor
can
she
receive
anything
from
it
that
will
enhance
her
own
quality
her
development
her
freedom
her
independence
must
come
from
and
through
herself
first
by
asserting
herself
as
a
personality
and
not
as
a
sex
commodity
second
by
refusing
the
right
to
anyone
over
her
body
by
refusing
to
bear
children
unless
she
wants
them
by
refusing
to
be
a
servant
to
god
the
state
society
the
husband
the
family
etc
by
making
her
life
simpler
but
deeper
and
richer
that
is
by
trying
to
learn
the
meaning
and
substance
of
life
in
all
its
complexities
by
freeing
herself
from
the
fear
of
public
opinion
and
public
condemnation
only
that
and
not
the
ballot
will
set
woman
free
will
make
her
a
force
hitherto
unknown
in
the
world
a
force
for
real
love
for
peace
for
harmony
a
force
of
divine
fire
of
life
giving
a
creator
of
free
men
and
women
equal
suffrage
helen
sumner
equal

helen
sumner
shackleton
was
a
labor
leader
it
is
therefore
that
he
should
introduce
a
bill
excluding
his
own
constituents
the
english
parliament
is
full
of
such
judases
equal

helen
sumner
the
tragedy
of
woman
emancipation
i
begin
with
an
admission
regardless
of
all
political
and
economic
theories
treating
of
the
fundamental
differences
between
various
groups
within
the
human
race
regardless
of
class
and
race
distinctions
regardless
of
all
artificial
boundary
lines
between
woman
rights
and
man
rights
i
hold
that
there
is
a
point
where
these
differentiations
may
meet
and
grow
into
one
perfect
whole
with
this
i
do
not
mean
to
propose
a
peace
treaty
the
general
social
antagonism
which
has
taken
hold
of
our
entire
public
life
today
brought
about
through
the
force
of
opposing
and
contradictory
interests
will
crumble
to
pieces
when
the
reorganization
of
our
social
life
based
upon
the
principles
of
economic
justice
shall
have
become
a
reality
peace
or
harmony
between
the
sexes
and
individuals
does
not
necessarily
depend
on
a
superficial
equalization
of
human
beings
nor
does
it
call
for
the
elimination
of
individual
traits
and
peculiarities
the
problem
that
confronts
us
today
and
which
the
nearest
future
is
to
solve
is
how
to
be
one
self
and
yet
in
oneness
with
others
to
feel
deeply
with
all
human
beings
and
still
retain
one
own
characteristic
qualities
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
basis
upon
which
the
mass
and
the
individual
the
true
democrat
and
the
true
individuality
man
and
woman
can
meet
without
antagonism
and
opposition
the
motto
should
not
be
forgive
one
another
rather
understand
one
another
the
sentence
of
madame
de
stael
to
understand
everything
means
to
forgive
everything
has
never
particularly
appealed
to
me
it
has
the
odor
of
the
confessional
to
forgive
one
conveys
the
idea
of
pharisaical
superiority
to
understand
one
suffices
the
admission
partly
represents
the
fundamental
aspect
of
my
views
on
the
emancipation
of
woman
and
its
effect
upon
the
entire
sex
emancipation
should
make
it
possible
for
woman
to
be
human
in
the
truest
sense
everything
within
her
that
craves
assertion
and
activity
should
reach
its
fullest
expression
all
artificial
barriers
should
be
broken
and
the
road
towards
greater
freedom
cleared
of
every
trace
of
centuries
of
submission
and
slavery
this
was
the
original
aim
of
the
movement
for
woman
emancipation
but
the
results
so
far
achieved
have
isolated
woman
and
have
robbed
her
of
the
fountain
springs
of
that
happiness
which
is
so
essential
to
her
merely
external
emancipation
has
made
of
the
modern
woman
an
artificial
being
who
reminds
one
of
the
products
of
french
arboriculture
with
its
arabesque
trees
and
shrubs
pyramids
wheels
and
wreaths
anything
except
the
forms
which
would
be
reached
by
the
expression
of
her
own
inner
qualities
such
artificially
grown
plants
of
the
female
sex
are
to
be
found
in
large
numbers
especially
in
the
intellectual
sphere
of
our
life
liberty
and
equality
for
woman
what
hopes
and
aspirations
these
words
awakened
when
they
were
first
uttered
by
some
of
the
noblest
and
bravest
souls
of
those
days
the
sun
in
all
his
light
and
glory
was
to
rise
upon
a
new
world
in
this
world
woman
was
to
be
free
to
direct
her
own
destiny
an
aim
certainly
worthy
of
the
great
enthusiasm
courage
perseverance
and
ceaseless
effort
of
the
tremendous
host
of
pioneer
men
and
women
who
staked
everything
against
a
world
of
prejudice
and
ignorance
my
hopes
also
move
towards
that
goal
but
i
hold
that
the
emancipation
of
woman
as
interpreted
and
practically
applied
today
has
failed
to
reach
that
great
end
now
woman
is
confronted
with
the
necessity
of
emancipating
herself
from
emancipation
if
she
really
desires
to
be
free
this
may
sound
paradoxical
but
is
nevertheless
only
too
true
what
has
she
achieved
through
her
emancipation
equal
suffrage
in
a
few
states
has
that
purified
our
political
life
as
many
advocates
predicted
certainly
not
incidentally
it
is
really
time
that
persons
with
plain
sound
judgment
should
cease
to
talk
about
corruption
in
politics
in
a
tone
corruption
of
politics
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
morals
or
the
laxity
of
morals
of
various
political
personalities
its
cause
is
altogether
a
material
one
politics
is
the
reflex
of
the
business
and
industrial
world
the
mottos
of
which
are
to
take
is
more
blessed
than
to
give
buy
cheap
and
sell
dear
one
soiled
hand
washes
the
other
there
is
no
hope
even
that
woman
with
her
right
to
vote
will
ever
purify
politics
emancipation
has
brought
woman
economic
equality
with
man
that
is
she
can
choose
her
own
profession
and
trade
but
as
her
past
and
present
physical
training
has
not
equipped
her
with
the
necessary
strength
to
compete
with
man
she
is
often
compelled
to
exhaust
all
her
energy
use
up
her
vitality
and
strain
every
nerve
in
order
to
reach
the
market
value
very
few
ever
succeed
for
it
is
a
fact
that
women
teachers
doctors
lawyers
architects
and
engineers
are
neither
met
with
the
same
confidence
as
their
male
colleagues
nor
receive
equal
remuneration
and
those
that
do
reach
that
enticing
equality
generally
do
so
at
the
expense
of
their
physical
and
psychical
as
to
the
great
mass
of
working
girls
and
women
how
much
independence
is
gained
if
the
narrowness
and
lack
of
freedom
of
the
home
is
exchanged
for
the
narrowness
and
lack
of
freedom
of
the
factory
department
store
or
office
in
addition
is
the
burden
which
is
laid
on
many
women
of
looking
after
a
home
sweet
home
cold
dreary
disorderly
uninviting
after
a
day
hard
work
glorious
independence
no
wonder
that
hundreds
of
girls
are
willing
to
accept
the
first
offer
of
marriage
sick
and
tired
of
their
independence
behind
the
counter
at
the
sewing
or
typewriting
machine
they
are
just
as
ready
to
marry
as
girls
of
the
middle
class
who
long
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
parental
supremacy
a
independence
which
leads
only
to
earning
the
merest
subsistence
is
not
so
enticing
not
so
ideal
that
one
could
expect
woman
to
sacrifice
everything
for
it
our
highly
praised
independence
is
after
all
but
a
slow
process
of
dulling
and
stifling
woman
nature
her
love
instinct
and
her
mother
instinct
nevertheless
the
position
of
the
working
girl
is
far
more
natural
and
human
than
that
of
her
seemingly
more
fortunate
sister
in
the
more
cultured
professional
walks
of
life
teachers
physicians
lawyers
engineers
who
have
to
make
a
dignified
proper
appearance
while
the
inner
life
is
growing
empty
and
dead
the
narrowness
of
the
existing
conception
of
woman
independence
and
emancipation
the
dread
of
love
for
a
man
who
is
not
her
social
equal
the
fear
that
love
will
rob
her
of
her
freedom
and
independence
the
horror
that
love
or
the
joy
of
motherhood
will
only
hinder
her
in
the
full
exercise
of
her
profession
all
these
together
make
of
the
emancipated
modern
woman
a
compulsory
vestal
before
whom
life
with
its
great
clarifying
sorrows
and
its
deep
entrancing
joys
rolls
on
without
touching
or
gripping
her
soul
emancipation
as
understood
by
the
majority
of
its
adherents
and
exponents
is
of
too
narrow
a
scope
to
permit
the
boundless
love
and
ecstasy
contained
in
the
deep
emotion
of
the
true
woman
sweetheart
mother
in
freedom
the
tragedy
of
the
or
economically
free
woman
does
not
lie
in
too
many
but
in
too
few
experiences
true
she
surpasses
her
sister
of
past
generations
in
knowledge
of
the
world
and
human
nature
it
is
just
because
of
this
that
she
feels
deeply
the
lack
of
life
essence
which
alone
can
enrich
the
human
soul
and
without
which
the
majority
of
women
have
become
mere
professional
automatons
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
was
bound
to
come
was
foreseen
by
those
who
realized
that
in
the
domain
of
ethics
there
still
remained
many
decaying
ruins
of
the
time
of
the
undisputed
superiority
of
man
ruins
that
are
still
considered
useful
and
what
is
more
important
a
goodly
number
of
the
emancipated
are
unable
to
get
along
without
them
every
movement
that
aims
at
the
destruction
of
existing
institutions
and
the
replacement
thereof
with
something
more
advanced
more
perfect
has
followers
who
in
theory
stand
for
the
most
radical
ideas
but
who
nevertheless
in
their
practice
are
like
the
average
philistine
feigning
respectability
and
clamoring
for
the
good
opinion
of
their
opponents
there
are
for
example
socialists
and
even
anarchists
who
stand
for
the
idea
that
property
is
robbery
yet
who
will
grow
indignant
if
anyone
owe
them
the
value
of
a
pins
the
same
philistine
can
be
found
in
the
movement
for
emancipation
yellow
journalists
and
litterateurs
have
painted
pictures
of
the
emancipated
woman
that
make
the
hair
of
the
good
citizen
and
his
dull
companion
stand
up
on
end
every
member
of
the
woman
rights
movement
was
pictured
as
a
george
sand
in
her
absolute
disregard
of
morality
nothing
was
sacred
to
her
she
had
no
respect
for
the
ideal
relation
between
man
and
woman
in
short
emancipation
stood
only
for
a
reckless
life
of
lust
and
sin
regardless
of
society
religion
and
morality
the
exponents
of
woman
rights
were
highly
indignant
at
such
representation
and
lacking
humor
they
exerted
all
their
energy
to
prove
that
they
were
not
at
all
as
bad
as
they
were
painted
but
the
very
reverse
of
course
as
long
as
woman
was
the
slave
of
man
she
could
not
be
good
and
pure
but
now
that
she
was
free
and
independent
she
would
prove
how
good
she
could
be
and
that
her
influence
would
have
a
purifying
effect
on
all
institutions
in
society
true
the
movement
for
woman
rights
has
broken
many
old
fetters
but
it
has
also
forged
new
ones
the
great
movement
of
true
emancipation
has
not
met
with
a
great
race
of
women
who
could
look
liberty
in
the
face
their
narrow
puritanical
vision
banished
man
as
a
disturber
and
doubtful
character
out
of
their
emotional
life
man
was
not
to
be
tolerated
at
any
price
except
perhaps
as
the
father
of
a
child
since
a
child
could
not
very
well
come
to
life
without
a
father
fortunately
the
most
rigid
puritans
never
will
be
strong
enough
to
kill
the
innate
craving
for
motherhood
but
woman
freedom
is
closely
allied
with
man
freedom
and
many
of
my
emancipated
sisters
seem
to
overlook
the
fact
that
a
child
born
in
freedom
needs
the
love
and
devotion
of
each
human
being
about
him
man
as
well
as
woman
unfortunately
it
is
this
narrow
conception
of
human
relations
that
has
brought
about
a
great
tragedy
in
the
lives
of
the
modern
man
and
woman
about
fifteen
years
ago
appeared
a
work
from
the
pen
of
the
brilliant
norwegian
laura
marholm
called
woman
a
character
study
she
was
one
of
the
first
to
call
attention
to
the
emptiness
and
narrowness
of
the
existing
conception
of
woman
emancipation
and
its
tragic
effect
upon
the
inner
life
of
woman
in
her
work
laura
marholm
speaks
of
the
fate
of
several
gifted
women
of
international
fame
the
genius
eleonora
duse
the
great
mathematician
and
writer
sonya
kovalevskaia
the
artist
and
marie
bashkirtzeff
who
died
so
young
through
each
description
of
the
lives
of
these
women
of
such
extraordinary
mentality
runs
a
marked
trail
of
unsatisfied
craving
for
a
full
rounded
complete
and
beautiful
life
and
the
unrest
and
loneliness
resulting
from
the
lack
of
it
through
these
masterly
psychological
sketches
one
can
not
help
but
see
that
the
higher
the
mental
development
of
woman
the
less
possible
it
is
for
her
to
meet
a
congenial
mate
who
will
see
in
her
not
only
sex
but
also
the
human
being
the
friend
the
comrade
and
strong
individuality
who
can
not
and
ought
not
lose
a
single
trait
of
her
character
the
average
man
with
his
his
ridiculously
superior
airs
of
patronage
towards
the
female
sex
is
an
impossibility
for
woman
as
depicted
in
the
character
study
by
laura
marholm
equally
impossible
for
her
is
the
man
who
can
see
in
her
nothing
more
than
her
mentality
and
her
genius
and
who
fails
to
awaken
her
woman
nature
a
rich
intellect
and
a
fine
soul
are
usually
considered
necessary
attributes
of
a
deep
and
beautiful
personality
in
the
case
of
the
modern
woman
these
attributes
serve
as
a
hindrance
to
the
complete
assertion
of
her
being
for
over
a
hundred
years
the
old
form
of
marriage
based
on
the
bible
till
death
doth
part
has
been
denounced
as
an
institution
that
stands
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
man
over
the
woman
of
her
complete
submission
to
his
whims
and
commands
and
absolute
dependence
on
his
name
and
support
time
and
again
it
has
been
conclusively
proved
that
the
old
matrimonial
relation
restricted
woman
to
the
function
of
a
man
servant
and
the
bearer
of
his
children
and
yet
we
find
many
emancipated
women
who
prefer
marriage
with
all
its
deficiencies
to
the
narrowness
of
an
unmarried
life
narrow
and
unendurable
because
of
the
chains
of
moral
and
social
prejudice
that
cramp
and
bind
her
nature
the
explanation
of
such
inconsistency
on
the
part
of
many
advanced
women
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
they
never
truly
understood
the
meaning
of
emancipation
they
thought
that
all
that
was
needed
was
independence
from
external
tyrannies
the
internal
tyrants
far
more
harmful
to
life
and
growth
ethical
and
social
conventions
were
left
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
they
have
taken
care
of
themselves
they
seem
to
get
along
as
beautifully
in
the
heads
and
hearts
of
the
most
active
exponents
of
woman
emancipation
as
in
the
heads
and
hearts
of
our
grandmothers
these
internal
tyrants
whether
they
be
in
the
form
of
public
opinion
or
what
will
mother
say
or
brother
father
aunt
or
relative
of
any
sort
what
will
grundy
comstock
the
employer
the
board
of
education
say
all
these
busybodies
moral
detectives
jailers
of
the
human
spirit
what
will
they
say
until
woman
has
learned
to
defy
them
all
to
stand
firmly
on
her
own
ground
and
to
insist
upon
her
own
unrestricted
freedom
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
her
nature
whether
it
call
for
life
greatest
treasure
love
for
a
man
or
her
most
glorious
privilege
the
right
to
give
birth
to
a
child
she
can
not
call
herself
emancipated
how
many
emancipated
women
are
brave
enough
to
acknowledge
that
the
voice
of
love
is
calling
wildly
beating
against
their
breasts
demanding
to
be
heard
to
be
satisfied
the
french
writer
jean
reibrach
in
one
of
his
novels
new
beauty
attempts
to
picture
the
ideal
beautiful
emancipated
woman
this
ideal
is
embodied
in
a
young
girl
a
physician
she
talks
very
cleverly
and
wisely
of
how
to
feed
infants
she
is
kind
and
administers
medicines
free
to
poor
mothers
she
converses
with
a
young
man
of
her
acquaintance
about
the
sanitary
conditions
of
the
future
and
how
various
bacilli
and
germs
shall
be
exterminated
by
the
use
of
stone
walls
and
floors
and
by
the
doing
away
with
rugs
and
hangings
she
is
of
course
very
plainly
and
practically
dressed
mostly
in
black
the
young
man
who
at
their
first
meeting
was
overawed
by
the
wisdom
of
his
emancipated
friend
gradually
learns
to
understand
her
and
recognizes
one
fine
day
that
he
loves
her
they
are
young
and
she
is
kind
and
beautiful
and
though
always
in
rigid
attire
her
appearance
is
softened
by
a
spotlessly
clean
white
collar
and
cuffs
one
would
expect
that
he
would
tell
her
of
his
love
but
he
is
not
one
to
commit
romantic
absurdities
poetry
and
the
enthusiasm
of
love
cover
their
blushing
faces
before
the
pure
beauty
of
the
lady
he
silences
the
voice
of
his
nature
and
remains
correct
she
too
is
always
exact
always
rational
always
well
behaved
i
fear
if
they
had
formed
a
union
the
young
man
would
have
risked
freezing
to
death
i
must
confess
that
i
can
see
nothing
beautiful
in
this
new
beauty
who
is
as
cold
as
the
stone
walls
and
floors
she
dreams
of
rather
would
i
have
the
love
songs
of
romantic
ages
rather
don
juan
and
madame
venus
rather
an
elopement
by
ladder
and
rope
on
a
moonlight
night
followed
by
the
father
curse
mother
moans
and
the
moral
comments
of
neighbors
than
correctness
and
propriety
measured
by
yardsticks
if
love
does
not
know
how
to
give
and
take
without
restrictions
it
is
not
love
but
a
transaction
that
never
fails
to
lay
stress
on
a
plus
and
a
minus
the
greatest
shortcoming
of
the
emancipation
of
the
present
day
lies
in
its
artificial
stiffness
and
its
narrow
respectabilities
which
produce
an
emptiness
in
woman
soul
that
will
not
let
her
drink
from
the
fountain
of
life
i
once
remarked
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
deeper
relationship
between
the
mother
and
hostess
ever
on
the
alert
for
the
happiness
of
her
little
ones
and
the
comfort
of
those
she
loved
and
the
truly
new
woman
than
between
the
latter
and
her
average
emancipated
sister
the
disciples
of
emancipation
pure
and
simple
declared
me
a
heathen
fit
only
for
the
stake
their
blind
zeal
did
not
let
them
see
that
my
comparison
between
the
old
and
the
new
was
merely
to
prove
that
a
goodly
number
of
our
grandmothers
had
more
blood
in
their
veins
far
more
humor
and
wit
and
certainly
a
greater
amount
of
naturalness
and
simplicity
than
the
majority
of
our
emancipated
professional
women
who
fill
the
colleges
halls
of
learning
and
various
offices
this
does
not
mean
a
wish
to
return
to
the
past
nor
does
it
condemn
woman
to
her
old
sphere
the
kitchen
and
the
nursery
salvation
lies
in
an
energetic
march
onward
towards
a
brighter
and
clearer
future
we
are
in
need
of
unhampered
growth
out
of
old
traditions
and
habits
the
movement
for
woman
emancipation
has
so
far
made
but
the
first
step
in
that
direction
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
it
will
gather
strength
to
make
another
the
right
to
vote
or
equal
civil
rights
may
be
good
demands
but
true
emancipation
begins
neither
at
the
polls
nor
in
courts
it
begins
in
woman
soul
history
tells
us
that
every
oppressed
class
gained
true
liberation
from
its
masters
through
its
own
efforts
it
is
necessary
that
woman
learn
that
lesson
that
she
realize
that
her
freedom
will
reach
as
far
as
her
power
to
achieve
her
freedom
reaches
it
is
therefore
far
more
important
for
her
to
begin
with
her
inner
regeneration
to
cut
loose
from
the
weight
of
prejudices
traditions
and
customs
the
demand
for
equal
rights
in
every
vocation
of
life
is
just
and
fair
but
after
all
the
most
vital
right
is
the
right
to
love
and
be
loved
indeed
if
partial
emancipation
is
to
become
a
complete
and
true
emancipation
of
woman
it
will
have
to
do
away
with
the
ridiculous
notion
that
to
be
loved
to
be
sweetheart
and
mother
is
synonymous
with
being
slave
or
subordinate
it
will
have
to
do
away
with
the
absurd
notion
of
the
dualism
of
the
sexes
or
that
man
and
woman
represent
two
antagonistic
worlds
pettiness
separates
breadth
unites
let
us
be
broad
and
big
let
us
not
overlook
vital
things
because
of
the
bulk
of
trifles
confronting
us
a
true
conception
of
the
relation
of
the
sexes
will
not
admit
of
conqueror
and
conquered
it
knows
of
but
one
great
thing
to
give
of
one
self
boundlessly
in
order
to
find
one
self
richer
deeper
better
that
alone
can
fill
the
emptiness
and
transform
the
tragedy
of
woman
emancipation
into
joy
limitless
joy
marriage
and
love
the
popular
notion
about
marriage
and
love
is
that
they
are
synonymous
that
they
spring
from
the
same
motives
and
cover
the
same
human
needs
like
most
popular
notions
this
also
rests
not
on
actual
facts
but
on
superstition
marriage
and
love
have
nothing
in
common
they
are
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
are
in
fact
antagonistic
to
each
other
no
doubt
some
marriages
have
been
the
result
of
love
not
however
because
love
could
assert
itself
only
in
marriage
much
rather
is
it
because
few
people
can
completely
outgrow
a
convention
there
are
today
large
numbers
of
men
and
women
to
whom
marriage
is
naught
but
a
farce
but
who
submit
to
it
for
the
sake
of
public
opinion
at
any
rate
while
it
is
true
that
some
marriages
are
based
on
love
and
while
it
is
equally
true
that
in
some
cases
love
continues
in
married
life
i
maintain
that
it
does
so
regardless
of
marriage
and
not
because
of
it
on
the
other
hand
it
is
utterly
false
that
love
results
from
marriage
on
rare
occasions
one
does
hear
of
a
miraculous
case
of
a
married
couple
falling
in
love
after
marriage
but
on
close
examination
it
will
be
found
that
it
is
a
mere
adjustment
to
the
inevitable
certainly
the
to
each
other
is
far
away
from
the
spontaneity
the
intensity
and
beauty
of
love
without
which
the
intimacy
of
marriage
must
prove
degrading
to
both
the
woman
and
the
man
marriage
is
primarily
an
economic
arrangement
an
insurance
pact
it
differs
from
the
ordinary
life
insurance
agreement
only
in
that
it
is
more
binding
more
exacting
its
returns
are
insignificantly
small
compared
with
the
investments
in
taking
out
an
insurance
policy
one
pays
for
it
in
dollars
and
cents
always
at
liberty
to
discontinue
payments
if
however
woman
premium
is
her
husband
she
pays
for
it
with
her
name
her
privacy
her
her
very
life
until
death
doth
part
moreover
the
marriage
insurance
condemns
her
to
dependency
to
parasitism
to
complete
uselessness
individual
as
well
as
social
man
too
pays
his
toll
but
as
his
sphere
is
wider
marriage
does
not
limit
him
as
much
as
woman
he
feels
his
chains
more
in
an
economic
sense
thus
dante
motto
over
inferno
applies
with
equal
force
to
marriage
ye
who
enter
here
leave
all
hope
behind
that
marriage
is
a
failure
none
but
the
very
stupid
will
deny
one
has
but
to
glance
over
the
statistics
of
divorce
to
realize
how
bitter
a
failure
marriage
really
is
nor
will
the
stereotyped
philistine
argument
that
the
laxity
of
divorce
laws
and
the
growing
looseness
of
woman
account
for
the
fact
that
first
every
twelfth
marriage
ends
in
divorce
second
that
since
divorces
have
increased
from
to
for
every
hundred
thousand
population
third
that
adultery
since
as
ground
for
divorce
has
increased
per
cent
fourth
that
desertion
increased
per
cent
added
to
these
startling
figures
is
a
vast
amount
of
material
dramatic
and
literary
further
elucidating
this
subject
robert
herrick
in
together
pinero
in
eugene
walter
in
paid
in
full
and
scores
of
other
writers
are
discussing
the
barrenness
the
monotony
the
sordidness
the
inadequacy
of
marriage
as
a
factor
for
harmony
and
understanding
the
thoughtful
social
student
will
not
content
himself
with
the
popular
superficial
excuse
for
this
phenomenon
he
will
have
to
dig
deeper
into
the
very
life
of
the
sexes
to
know
why
marriage
proves
so
disastrous
edward
carpenter
says
that
behind
every
marriage
stands
the
environment
of
the
two
sexes
an
environment
so
different
from
each
other
that
man
and
woman
must
remain
strangers
separated
by
an
insurmountable
wall
of
superstition
custom
and
habit
marriage
has
not
the
potentiality
of
developing
knowledge
of
and
respect
for
each
other
without
which
every
union
is
doomed
to
failure
henrik
ibsen
the
hater
of
all
social
shams
was
probably
the
first
to
realize
this
great
truth
nora
leaves
her
husband
not
as
the
stupid
critic
would
have
it
because
she
is
tired
of
her
responsibilities
or
feels
the
need
of
woman
rights
but
because
she
has
come
to
know
that
for
eight
years
she
had
lived
with
a
stranger
and
borne
him
children
can
there
be
anything
more
humiliating
more
degrading
than
a
proximity
between
two
strangers
no
need
for
the
woman
to
know
anything
of
the
man
save
his
income
as
to
the
knowledge
of
the
woman
what
is
there
to
know
except
that
she
has
a
pleasing
appearance
we
have
not
yet
outgrown
the
theologic
myth
that
woman
has
no
soul
that
she
is
a
mere
appendix
to
man
made
out
of
his
rib
just
for
the
convenience
of
the
gentleman
who
was
so
strong
that
he
was
afraid
of
his
own
shadow
perchance
the
poor
quality
of
the
material
whence
woman
comes
is
responsible
for
her
inferiority
at
any
rate
woman
has
no
soul
what
is
there
to
know
about
her
besides
the
less
soul
a
woman
has
the
greater
her
asset
as
a
wife
the
more
readily
will
she
absorb
herself
in
her
husband
it
is
this
slavish
acquiescence
to
man
superiority
that
has
kept
the
marriage
institution
seemingly
intact
for
so
long
a
period
now
that
woman
is
coming
into
her
own
now
that
she
is
actually
growing
aware
of
herself
as
being
outside
of
the
master
grace
the
sacred
institution
of
marriage
is
gradually
being
undermined
and
no
amount
of
sentimental
lamentation
can
stay
it
from
infancy
almost
the
average
girl
is
told
that
marriage
is
her
ultimate
goal
therefore
her
training
and
education
must
be
directed
towards
that
end
like
the
mute
beast
fattened
for
slaughter
she
is
prepared
for
that
yet
strange
to
say
she
is
allowed
to
know
much
less
about
her
function
as
wife
and
mother
than
the
ordinary
artisan
of
his
trade
it
is
indecent
and
filthy
for
a
respectable
girl
to
know
anything
of
the
marital
relation
oh
for
the
inconsistency
of
respectability
that
needs
the
marriage
vow
to
turn
something
which
is
filthy
into
the
purest
and
most
sacred
arrangement
that
none
dare
question
or
criticize
yet
that
is
exactly
the
attitude
of
the
average
upholder
of
marriage
the
prospective
wife
and
mother
is
kept
in
complete
ignorance
of
her
only
asset
in
the
competitive
field
sex
thus
she
enters
into
relations
with
a
man
only
to
find
herself
shocked
repelled
outraged
beyond
measure
by
the
most
natural
and
healthy
instinct
sex
it
is
safe
to
say
that
a
large
percentage
of
the
unhappiness
misery
distress
and
physical
suffering
of
matrimony
is
due
to
the
criminal
ignorance
in
sex
matters
that
is
being
extolled
as
a
great
virtue
nor
is
it
at
all
an
exaggeration
when
i
say
that
more
than
one
home
has
been
broken
up
because
of
this
deplorable
fact
if
however
woman
is
free
and
big
enough
to
learn
the
mystery
of
sex
without
the
sanction
of
state
or
church
she
will
stand
condemned
as
utterly
unfit
to
become
the
wife
of
a
good
man
his
goodness
consisting
of
an
empty
brain
and
plenty
of
money
can
there
be
anything
more
outrageous
than
the
idea
that
a
healthy
grown
woman
full
of
life
and
passion
must
deny
nature
demand
must
subdue
her
most
intense
craving
undermine
her
health
and
break
her
spirit
must
stunt
her
vision
abstain
from
the
depth
and
glory
of
sex
experience
until
a
good
man
comes
along
to
take
her
unto
himself
as
a
wife
that
is
precisely
what
marriage
means
how
can
such
an
arrangement
end
except
in
failure
this
is
one
though
not
the
least
important
factor
of
marriage
which
differentiates
it
from
love
ours
is
a
practical
age
the
time
when
romeo
and
juliet
risked
the
wrath
of
their
fathers
for
love
when
gretchen
exposed
herself
to
the
gossip
of
her
neighbors
for
love
is
no
more
if
on
rare
occasions
young
people
allow
themselves
the
luxury
of
romance
they
are
taken
in
care
by
the
elders
drilled
and
pounded
until
they
become
sensible
the
moral
lesson
instilled
in
the
girl
is
not
whether
the
man
has
aroused
her
love
but
rather
is
it
how
much
the
important
and
only
god
of
practical
american
life
can
the
man
make
a
living
can
he
support
a
wife
that
is
the
only
thing
that
justifies
marriage
gradually
this
saturates
every
thought
of
the
girl
her
dreams
are
not
of
moonlight
and
kisses
of
laughter
and
tears
she
dreams
of
shopping
tours
and
bargain
counters
this
soul
poverty
and
sordidness
are
the
elements
inherent
in
the
marriage
institution
the
state
and
church
approve
of
no
other
ideal
simply
because
it
is
the
one
that
necessitates
the
state
and
church
control
of
men
and
women
doubtless
there
are
people
who
continue
to
consider
love
above
dollars
and
cents
particularly
this
is
true
of
that
class
whom
economic
necessity
has
forced
to
become
the
tremendous
change
in
woman
position
wrought
by
that
mighty
factor
is
indeed
phenomenal
when
we
reflect
that
it
is
but
a
short
time
since
she
has
entered
the
industrial
arena
six
million
women
wage
workers
six
million
women
who
have
equal
right
with
men
to
be
exploited
to
be
robbed
to
go
on
strike
aye
to
starve
even
anything
more
my
lord
yes
six
million
wage
workers
in
every
walk
of
life
from
the
highest
brain
work
to
the
mines
and
railroad
tracks
yes
even
detectives
and
policemen
surely
the
emancipation
is
complete
yet
with
all
that
but
a
very
small
number
of
the
vast
army
of
women
wage
workers
look
upon
work
as
a
permanent
issue
in
the
same
light
as
does
man
no
matter
how
decrepit
the
latter
he
has
been
taught
to
be
independent
oh
i
know
that
no
one
is
really
independent
in
our
economic
treadmill
still
the
poorest
specimen
of
a
man
hates
to
be
a
parasite
to
be
known
as
such
at
any
rate
the
woman
considers
her
position
as
worker
transitory
to
be
thrown
aside
for
the
first
bidder
that
is
why
it
is
infinitely
harder
to
organize
women
than
men
why
should
i
join
a
union
i
am
going
to
get
married
to
have
a
home
has
she
not
been
taught
from
infancy
to
look
upon
that
as
her
ultimate
calling
she
learns
soon
enough
that
the
home
though
not
so
large
a
prison
as
the
factory
has
more
solid
doors
and
bars
it
has
a
keeper
so
faithful
that
naught
can
escape
him
the
most
tragic
part
however
is
that
the
home
no
longer
frees
her
from
wage
slavery
it
only
increases
her
task
according
to
the
latest
statistics
submitted
before
a
committee
on
labor
and
wages
and
congestion
of
population
ten
per
cent
of
the
wage
workers
in
new
york
city
alone
are
married
yet
they
must
continue
to
work
at
the
most
poorly
paid
labor
in
the
world
add
to
this
horrible
aspect
the
drudgery
of
housework
and
what
remains
of
the
protection
and
glory
of
the
home
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
the
girl
in
marriage
can
not
speak
of
her
home
since
it
is
the
man
who
creates
her
sphere
it
is
not
important
whether
the
husband
is
a
brute
or
a
darling
what
i
wish
to
prove
is
that
marriage
guarantees
woman
a
home
only
by
the
grace
of
her
husband
there
she
moves
about
in
his
home
year
after
year
until
her
aspect
of
life
and
human
affairs
becomes
as
flat
narrow
and
drab
as
her
surroundings
small
wonder
if
she
becomes
a
nag
petty
quarrelsome
gossipy
unbearable
thus
driving
the
man
from
the
house
she
could
not
go
if
she
wanted
to
there
is
no
place
to
go
besides
a
short
period
of
married
life
of
complete
surrender
of
all
faculties
absolutely
incapacitates
the
average
woman
for
the
outside
world
she
becomes
reckless
in
appearance
clumsy
in
her
movements
dependent
in
her
decisions
cowardly
in
her
judgment
a
weight
and
a
bore
which
most
men
grow
to
hate
and
despise
wonderfully
inspiring
atmosphere
for
the
bearing
of
life
is
it
not
but
the
child
how
is
it
to
be
protected
if
not
for
marriage
after
all
is
not
that
the
most
important
consideration
the
sham
the
hypocrisy
of
it
marriage
protecting
the
child
yet
thousands
of
children
destitute
and
homeless
marriage
protecting
the
child
yet
orphan
asylums
and
reformatories
overcrowded
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
keeping
busy
in
rescuing
the
little
victims
from
loving
parents
to
place
them
under
more
loving
care
the
gerry
society
oh
the
mockery
of
it
marriage
may
have
the
power
to
bring
the
horse
to
water
but
has
it
ever
made
him
drink
the
law
will
place
the
father
under
arrest
and
put
him
in
convict
clothes
but
has
that
ever
stilled
the
hunger
of
the
child
if
the
parent
has
no
work
or
if
he
hides
his
identity
what
does
marriage
do
then
it
invokes
the
law
to
bring
the
man
to
justice
to
put
him
safely
behind
closed
doors
his
labor
however
goes
not
to
the
child
but
to
the
state
the
child
receives
but
a
blighted
memory
of
his
father
stripes
as
to
the
protection
of
the
woman
therein
lies
the
curse
of
marriage
not
that
it
really
protects
her
but
the
very
idea
is
so
revolting
such
an
outrage
and
insult
on
life
so
degrading
to
human
dignity
as
to
forever
condemn
this
parasitic
institution
it
is
like
that
other
paternal
arrangement
capitalism
it
robs
man
of
his
birthright
stunts
his
growth
poisons
his
body
keeps
him
in
ignorance
in
poverty
and
dependence
and
then
institutes
charities
that
thrive
on
the
last
vestige
of
man
the
institution
of
marriage
makes
a
parasite
of
woman
an
absolute
dependent
it
incapacitates
her
for
life
struggle
annihilates
her
social
consciousness
paralyzes
her
imagination
and
then
imposes
its
gracious
protection
which
is
in
reality
a
snare
a
travesty
on
human
character
if
motherhood
is
the
highest
fulfillment
of
woman
nature
what
other
protection
does
it
need
save
love
and
freedom
marriage
but
defiles
outrages
and
corrupts
her
fulfillment
does
it
not
say
to
woman
only
when
you
follow
me
shall
you
bring
forth
life
does
it
not
condemn
her
to
the
block
does
it
not
degrade
and
shame
her
if
she
refuses
to
buy
her
right
to
motherhood
by
selling
herself
does
not
marriage
only
sanction
motherhood
even
though
conceived
in
hatred
in
compulsion
yet
if
motherhood
be
of
free
choice
of
love
of
ecstasy
of
defiant
passion
does
it
not
place
a
crown
of
thorns
upon
an
innocent
head
and
carve
in
letters
of
blood
the
hideous
epithet
bastard
were
marriage
to
contain
all
the
virtues
claimed
for
it
its
crimes
against
motherhood
would
exclude
it
forever
from
the
realm
of
love
love
the
strongest
and
deepest
element
in
all
life
the
harbinger
of
hope
of
joy
of
ecstasy
love
the
defier
of
all
laws
of
all
conventions
love
the
freest
the
most
powerful
moulder
of
human
destiny
how
can
such
an
force
be
synonymous
with
that
poor
little
state
and
weed
marriage
free
love
as
if
love
is
anything
but
free
man
has
bought
brains
but
all
the
millions
in
the
world
have
failed
to
buy
love
man
has
subdued
bodies
but
all
the
power
on
earth
has
been
unable
to
subdue
love
man
has
conquered
whole
nations
but
all
his
armies
could
not
conquer
love
man
has
chained
and
fettered
the
spirit
but
he
has
been
utterly
helpless
before
love
high
on
a
throne
with
all
the
splendor
and
pomp
his
gold
can
command
man
is
yet
poor
and
desolate
if
love
passes
him
by
and
if
it
stays
the
poorest
hovel
is
radiant
with
warmth
with
life
and
color
thus
love
has
the
magic
power
to
make
of
a
beggar
a
king
yes
love
is
free
it
can
dwell
in
no
other
atmosphere
in
freedom
it
gives
itself
unreservedly
abundantly
completely
all
the
laws
on
the
statutes
all
the
courts
in
the
universe
can
not
tear
it
from
the
soil
once
love
has
taken
root
if
however
the
soil
is
sterile
how
can
marriage
make
it
bear
fruit
it
is
like
the
last
desperate
struggle
of
fleeting
life
against
death
love
needs
no
protection
it
is
its
own
protection
so
long
as
love
begets
life
no
child
is
deserted
or
hungry
or
famished
for
the
want
of
affection
i
know
this
to
be
true
i
know
women
who
became
mothers
in
freedom
by
the
men
they
loved
few
children
in
wedlock
enjoy
the
care
the
protection
the
devotion
free
motherhood
is
capable
of
bestowing
the
defenders
of
authority
dread
the
advent
of
a
free
motherhood
lest
it
will
rob
them
of
their
prey
who
would
fight
wars
who
would
create
wealth
who
would
make
the
policeman
the
jailer
if
woman
were
to
refuse
the
indiscriminate
breeding
of
children
the
race
the
race
shouts
the
king
the
president
the
capitalist
the
priest
the
race
must
be
preserved
though
woman
be
degraded
to
a
mere
machine
and
the
marriage
institution
is
our
only
safety
valve
against
the
pernicious
sex
awakening
of
woman
but
in
vain
these
frantic
efforts
to
maintain
a
state
of
bondage
in
vain
too
the
edicts
of
the
church
the
mad
attacks
of
rulers
in
vain
even
the
arm
of
the
law
woman
no
longer
wants
to
be
a
party
to
the
production
of
a
race
of
sickly
feeble
decrepit
wretched
human
beings
who
have
neither
the
strength
nor
moral
courage
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
poverty
and
slavery
instead
she
desires
fewer
and
better
children
begotten
and
reared
in
love
and
through
free
choice
not
by
compulsion
as
marriage
imposes
our
have
yet
to
learn
the
deep
sense
of
responsibility
toward
the
child
that
love
in
freedom
has
awakened
in
the
breast
of
woman
rather
would
she
forego
forever
the
glory
of
motherhood
than
bring
forth
life
in
an
atmosphere
that
breathes
only
destruction
and
death
and
if
she
does
become
a
mother
it
is
to
give
to
the
child
the
deepest
and
best
her
being
can
yield
to
grow
with
the
child
is
her
motto
she
knows
that
in
that
manner
alone
can
she
help
build
true
manhood
and
womanhood
ibsen
must
have
had
a
vision
of
a
free
mother
when
with
a
master
stroke
he
portrayed
alving
she
was
the
ideal
mother
because
she
had
outgrown
marriage
and
all
its
horrors
because
she
had
broken
her
chains
and
set
her
spirit
free
to
soar
until
it
returned
a
personality
regenerated
and
strong
alas
it
was
too
late
to
rescue
her
life
joy
her
oswald
but
not
too
late
to
realize
that
love
in
freedom
is
the
only
condition
of
a
beautiful
life
those
who
like
alving
have
paid
with
blood
and
tears
for
their
spiritual
awakening
repudiate
marriage
as
an
imposition
a
shallow
empty
mockery
they
know
whether
love
last
but
one
brief
span
of
time
or
for
eternity
it
is
the
only
creative
inspiring
elevating
basis
for
a
new
race
a
new
world
in
our
present
pygmy
state
love
is
indeed
a
stranger
to
most
people
misunderstood
and
shunned
it
rarely
takes
root
or
if
it
does
it
soon
withers
and
dies
its
delicate
fiber
can
not
endure
the
stress
and
strain
of
the
daily
grind
its
soul
is
too
complex
to
adjust
itself
to
the
slimy
woof
of
our
social
fabric
it
weeps
and
moans
and
suffers
with
those
who
have
need
of
it
yet
lack
the
capacity
to
rise
to
love
summit
some
day
some
day
men
and
women
will
rise
they
will
reach
the
mountain
peak
they
will
meet
big
and
strong
and
free
ready
to
receive
to
partake
and
to
bask
in
the
golden
rays
of
love
what
fancy
what
imagination
what
poetic
genius
can
foresee
even
approximately
the
potentialities
of
such
a
force
in
the
life
of
men
and
women
if
the
world
is
ever
to
give
birth
to
true
companionship
and
oneness
not
marriage
but
love
will
be
the
parent
the
modern
drama
a
powerful
disseminator
of
radical
thought
so
long
as
discontent
and
unrest
make
themselves
but
dumbly
felt
within
a
limited
social
class
the
powers
of
reaction
may
often
succeed
in
suppressing
such
manifestations
but
when
the
dumb
unrest
grows
into
conscious
expression
and
becomes
almost
universal
it
necessarily
affects
all
phases
of
human
thought
and
action
and
seeks
its
individual
and
social
expression
in
the
gradual
transvaluation
of
existing
values
an
adequate
appreciation
of
the
tremendous
spread
of
the
modern
conscious
social
unrest
can
not
be
gained
from
merely
propagandistic
literature
rather
must
we
become
conversant
with
the
larger
phases
of
human
expression
manifest
in
art
literature
and
above
all
the
modern
drama
the
strongest
and
most
interpreter
of
our
dissatisfaction
what
a
tremendous
factor
for
the
awakening
of
conscious
discontent
are
the
simple
canvasses
of
a
millet
the
figures
of
his
peasants
what
terrific
indictment
against
our
social
wrongs
wrongs
that
condemn
the
man
with
the
hoe
to
hopeless
drudgery
himself
excluded
from
nature
bounty
the
vision
of
a
meunier
conceives
the
growing
solidarity
and
defiance
of
labor
in
the
group
of
miners
carrying
their
maimed
brother
to
safety
his
genius
thus
powerfully
portrays
the
interrelation
of
the
seething
unrest
among
those
slaving
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
the
spiritual
revolt
that
seeks
artistic
expression
no
less
important
is
the
factor
for
rebellious
awakening
in
modern
literature
turgeniev
dostoyevsky
tolstoy
andreiev
gorki
whitman
emerson
and
scores
of
others
embodying
the
spirit
of
universal
ferment
and
the
longing
for
social
change
still
more
is
the
modern
drama
as
the
leaven
of
radical
thought
and
the
disseminator
of
new
values
it
might
seem
an
exaggeration
to
ascribe
to
the
modern
drama
such
an
important
role
but
a
study
of
the
development
of
modern
ideas
in
most
countries
will
prove
that
the
drama
has
succeeded
in
driving
home
great
social
truths
truths
generally
ignored
when
presented
in
other
forms
no
doubt
there
are
exceptions
as
russia
and
france
russia
with
its
terrible
political
pressure
has
made
people
think
and
has
awakened
their
social
sympathies
because
of
the
tremendous
contrast
which
exists
between
the
intellectual
life
of
the
people
and
the
despotic
regime
that
is
trying
to
crush
that
life
yet
while
the
great
dramatic
works
of
tolstoy
tchechov
gorki
and
andreiev
closely
mirror
the
life
and
the
struggle
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
the
russian
people
they
did
not
influence
radical
thought
to
the
extent
the
drama
has
done
in
other
countries
who
can
deny
however
the
tremendous
influence
exerted
by
the
power
of
darkness
or
night
lodging
tolstoy
the
real
true
christian
is
yet
the
greatest
enemy
of
organized
christianity
with
a
master
hand
he
portrays
the
destructive
effects
upon
the
human
mind
of
the
power
of
darkness
the
superstitions
of
the
christian
church
what
other
medium
could
express
with
such
dramatic
force
the
responsibility
of
the
church
for
crimes
committed
by
its
deluded
victims
what
other
medium
could
in
consequence
rouse
the
indignation
of
man
conscience
similarly
direct
and
powerful
is
the
indictment
contained
in
night
lodging
the
social
pariahs
forced
into
poverty
and
crime
yet
desperately
clutch
at
the
last
vestiges
of
hope
and
aspiration
lost
existences
these
blighted
and
crushed
by
cruel
unsocial
environment
france
on
the
other
hand
with
her
continuous
struggle
for
liberty
is
indeed
the
cradle
of
radical
thought
as
such
she
too
did
not
need
the
drama
as
a
means
of
awakening
and
yet
the
works
of
brieux
as
robe
rouge
portraying
the
terrible
corruption
of
the
judiciary
and
mirbeau
les
affaires
sont
les
affaires
picturing
the
destructive
influence
of
wealth
on
the
human
soul
have
undoubtedly
reached
wider
circles
than
most
of
the
articles
and
books
which
have
been
written
in
france
on
the
social
question
in
countries
like
germany
scandinavia
england
and
even
in
america
though
in
a
lesser
degree
the
drama
is
the
vehicle
which
is
really
making
history
disseminating
radical
thought
in
ranks
not
otherwise
to
be
reached
let
us
take
germany
for
instance
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
men
of
brains
of
ideas
and
of
the
greatest
integrity
made
it
their
to
spread
the
truth
of
human
brotherhood
of
justice
among
the
oppressed
and
downtrodden
socialism
that
tremendous
revolutionary
wave
was
to
the
victims
of
a
merciless
and
inhumane
system
like
water
to
the
parched
lips
of
the
desert
traveler
alas
the
cultured
people
remained
absolutely
indifferent
to
them
that
revolutionary
tide
was
but
the
murmur
of
dissatisfied
discontented
men
dangerous
illiterate
troublemakers
whose
proper
place
was
behind
prison
bars
as
the
cultured
usually
are
they
could
not
understand
why
one
should
fuss
about
the
fact
that
thousands
of
people
were
starving
though
they
contributed
towards
the
wealth
of
the
world
surrounded
by
beauty
and
luxury
they
could
not
believe
that
side
by
side
with
them
lived
human
beings
degraded
to
a
position
lower
than
a
beast
shelterless
and
ragged
without
hope
or
ambition
this
condition
of
affairs
was
particularly
pronounced
in
germany
after
the
war
full
to
the
bursting
point
with
its
victory
germany
thrived
on
a
sentimental
patriotic
literature
thereby
poisoning
the
minds
of
the
country
youth
by
the
glory
of
conquest
and
bloodshed
intellectual
germany
had
to
take
refuge
in
the
literature
of
other
countries
in
the
works
of
ibsen
zola
daudet
maupassant
and
especially
in
the
great
works
of
dostoyevsky
tolstoy
and
turgeniev
but
as
no
country
can
long
maintain
a
standard
of
culture
without
a
literature
and
drama
related
to
its
own
soil
so
germany
gradually
began
to
develop
a
drama
reflecting
the
life
and
the
struggles
of
its
own
people
arno
holz
one
of
the
youngest
dramatists
of
that
period
startled
the
philistines
out
of
their
ease
and
comfort
with
his
familie
selicke
the
play
deals
with
society
refuse
men
and
women
of
the
alleys
whose
only
subsistence
consists
of
what
they
can
pick
out
of
the
garbage
barrels
a
gruesome
subject
is
it
not
and
yet
what
other
method
is
there
to
break
through
the
hard
shell
of
the
minds
and
souls
of
people
who
have
never
known
want
and
who
therefore
assume
that
all
is
well
in
the
world
needless
to
say
the
play
aroused
tremendous
indignation
the
truth
is
bitter
and
the
people
living
on
the
fifth
avenue
of
berlin
hated
to
be
confronted
with
the
truth
not
that
familie
selicke
represented
anything
that
had
not
been
written
about
for
years
without
any
seeming
result
but
the
dramatic
genius
of
holz
together
with
the
powerful
interpretation
of
the
play
necessarily
made
inroads
into
the
widest
circles
and
forced
people
to
think
about
the
terrible
inequalities
around
them
sudermann
ehre
and
heimat
deal
with
vital
subjects
i
have
already
referred
to
the
sentimental
patriotism
so
completely
turning
the
head
of
the
average
german
as
to
create
a
perverted
conception
of
honor
duelling
became
an
affair
costing
innumerable
lives
a
great
cry
was
raised
against
the
fad
by
a
number
of
leading
writers
but
nothing
acted
as
such
a
clarifier
and
exposer
of
that
national
disease
as
the
ehre
not
that
the
play
merely
deals
with
duelling
it
analyzes
the
real
meaning
of
honor
proving
that
it
is
not
a
fixed
inborn
feeling
but
that
it
varies
with
every
people
and
every
epoch
depending
particularly
on
one
economic
and
social
station
in
life
we
realize
from
this
play
that
the
man
in
the
brownstone
mansion
will
necessarily
define
honor
differently
from
his
victims
the
family
heinecke
enjoys
the
charity
of
the
millionaire
muhling
being
permitted
to
occupy
a
dilapidated
shanty
on
his
premises
in
the
absence
of
their
son
robert
the
latter
as
representative
is
making
a
vast
fortune
for
his
employer
in
india
on
his
return
robert
discovers
that
his
sister
had
been
seduced
by
young
muhling
whose
father
graciously
offers
to
straighten
matters
with
a
check
for
marks
robert
outraged
and
indignant
resents
the
insult
to
his
family
honor
and
is
forthwith
dismissed
from
his
position
for
impudence
robert
finally
throws
this
accusation
into
the
face
of
the
philanthropist
millionaire
we
slave
for
you
we
sacrifice
our
heart
blood
for
you
while
you
seduce
our
daughters
and
sisters
and
kindly
pay
for
their
disgrace
with
the
gold
we
have
earned
for
you
that
is
what
you
call
honor
an
incidental
upon
the
conception
of
honor
is
given
by
count
trast
the
principal
character
in
the
ehre
a
man
widely
conversant
with
the
customs
of
various
climes
who
relates
that
in
his
many
travels
he
chanced
across
a
savage
tribe
whose
honor
he
mortally
offended
by
refusing
the
hospitality
which
offered
him
the
charms
of
the
chieftain
wife
the
theme
of
heimat
treats
of
the
struggle
between
the
old
and
the
young
generations
it
holds
a
permanent
and
important
place
in
dramatic
literature
magda
the
daughter
of
lieutenant
colonel
schwartz
has
committed
an
unpardonable
sin
she
refused
the
suitor
selected
by
her
father
for
daring
to
disobey
the
parental
commands
she
is
driven
from
home
magda
full
of
life
and
the
spirit
of
liberty
goes
out
into
the
world
to
return
to
her
native
town
twelve
years
later
a
celebrated
singer
she
consents
to
visit
her
parents
on
condition
that
they
respect
the
privacy
of
her
past
but
her
martinet
father
immediately
begins
to
question
her
insisting
on
his
paternal
rights
magda
is
indignant
but
gradually
his
persistence
brings
to
light
the
tragedy
of
her
life
he
learns
that
the
respected
councillor
von
keller
had
in
his
student
days
been
magda
lover
while
she
was
battling
for
her
economic
and
social
independence
the
consequence
of
the
fleeting
romance
was
a
child
deserted
by
the
man
even
before
birth
the
rigid
military
father
of
magda
demands
as
retribution
from
councillor
von
keller
that
he
legalize
the
love
affair
in
view
of
magda
social
and
professional
success
keller
willingly
consents
but
on
condition
that
she
forsake
the
stage
and
place
the
child
in
an
institution
the
struggle
between
the
old
and
the
new
culminates
in
magda
defiant
words
of
the
woman
grown
to
conscious
independence
of
thought
and
action
i
say
what
i
think
of
you
of
you
and
your
respectable
society
why
should
i
be
worse
than
you
that
i
must
prolong
my
existence
among
you
by
a
lie
why
should
this
gold
upon
my
body
and
the
lustre
which
surrounds
my
name
only
increase
my
infamy
have
i
not
worked
early
and
late
for
ten
long
years
have
i
not
woven
this
dress
with
sleepless
nights
have
i
not
built
up
my
career
step
by
step
like
thousands
of
my
kind
why
should
i
blush
before
anyone
i
am
myself
and
through
myself
i
have
become
what
i
am
the
general
theme
of
heimat
was
not
original
it
had
been
previously
treated
by
a
master
hand
in
fathers
and
sons
partly
because
turgeniev
great
work
was
typical
rather
of
russian
than
universal
conditions
and
still
more
because
it
was
in
the
form
of
fiction
the
influence
of
fathers
and
sons
was
limited
to
russia
but
heimat
especially
because
of
its
dramatic
expression
became
almost
a
world
factor
the
dramatist
who
not
only
disseminated
radicalism
but
literally
revolutionized
the
thoughtful
germans
is
gerhardt
hauptmann
his
first
play
vor
sonnenaufgang
refused
by
every
leading
german
theatre
and
first
performed
in
a
wretched
little
playhouse
behind
a
beer
garden
acted
like
a
stroke
of
lightning
illuminating
the
entire
social
horizon
its
subject
matter
deals
with
the
life
of
an
extensive
landowner
ignorant
illiterate
and
brutalized
and
his
economic
slaves
of
the
same
mental
calibre
the
influence
of
wealth
both
on
the
victims
who
created
it
and
the
possessor
thereof
is
shown
in
the
most
vivid
colors
as
resulting
in
drunkenness
idiocy
and
decay
but
the
most
striking
feature
of
vor
sonnenaufgang
the
one
which
brought
a
shower
of
abuse
on
hauptmann
head
was
the
question
as
to
the
indiscriminate
breeding
of
children
by
unfit
parents
during
the
second
performance
of
the
play
a
leading
berlin
surgeon
almost
caused
a
panic
in
the
theatre
by
swinging
a
pair
of
forceps
over
his
head
and
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
decency
and
morality
of
germany
are
at
stake
if
childbirth
is
to
be
discussed
openly
from
the
stage
the
surgeon
is
forgotten
and
hauptmann
stands
a
colossal
figure
before
the
world
when
die
weber
first
saw
the
light
pandemonium
broke
out
in
the
land
of
thinkers
and
poets
what
cried
the
moralists
workingmen
dirty
filthy
slaves
to
be
put
on
the
stage
poverty
in
all
its
horrors
and
ugliness
to
be
dished
out
as
an
amusement
that
is
too
much
indeed
it
was
too
much
for
the
fat
and
greasy
bourgeoisie
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
the
horrors
of
the
weaver
existence
it
was
too
much
because
of
the
truth
and
reality
that
rang
like
thunder
in
the
deaf
ears
of
society
of
course
it
was
generally
known
even
before
the
appearance
of
this
drama
that
capital
can
not
get
fat
unless
it
devours
labor
that
wealth
can
not
be
hoarded
except
through
the
channels
of
poverty
hunger
and
cold
but
such
things
are
better
kept
in
the
dark
lest
the
victims
awaken
to
a
realization
of
their
position
but
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
modern
drama
to
rouse
the
consciousness
of
the
oppressed
and
that
indeed
was
the
purpose
of
gerhardt
hauptmann
in
depicting
to
the
world
the
conditions
of
the
weavers
in
silesia
human
beings
working
eighteen
hours
daily
yet
not
earning
enough
for
bread
and
fuel
human
beings
living
in
broken
wretched
huts
half
covered
with
snow
and
nothing
but
tatters
to
protect
them
from
the
cold
infants
covered
with
scurvy
from
hunger
and
exposure
pregnant
women
in
the
last
stages
of
consumption
victims
of
a
benevolent
christian
era
without
life
without
hope
without
warmth
ah
yes
it
was
too
much
hauptmann
dramatic
versatility
deals
with
every
stratum
of
social
life
besides
portraying
the
grinding
effect
of
economic
conditions
he
also
treats
of
the
struggle
of
the
individual
for
his
mental
and
spiritual
liberation
from
the
slavery
of
convention
and
tradition
thus
heinrich
the
in
the
dramatic
die
versunkene
glocke
fails
to
reach
the
mountain
peaks
of
liberty
because
as
rautendelein
said
he
had
lived
in
the
valley
too
long
similarly
vockerath
and
anna
maar
remain
lonely
souls
because
they
too
lack
the
strength
to
defy
venerated
traditions
yet
their
very
failure
must
awaken
the
rebellious
spirit
against
a
world
forever
hindering
individual
and
social
emancipation
max
halbe
jugend
and
wedekind
fruhling
erwachen
are
dramas
which
have
disseminated
radical
thought
in
an
altogether
different
direction
they
treat
of
the
child
and
the
dense
ignorance
and
narrow
puritanism
that
meet
the
awakening
of
nature
particularly
this
is
true
of
fruhling

young

sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
false

and
of
our
sickening
morality
that
prohibits
the
enlightenment
of

as
to
questions
so
imperative
to
the
health
and
of
society
the
origin
of

its

it
shows
how
a

a
truly
good

at

keeps
her

in
absolute
ignorance

to
all
matters

the

in

is
especially
illumined
by

in
so
far
as

a

in

years

a

specially
devoted
to
frank
and
intelligent
discussion
of
the
sex
problem
has
been
carrying
on
its
agitation
for
a
considerable
time
but
it
remained
for
the
dramatic
genius
of
wedekind
to
influence
radical
thought
to
the
extent
of
forcing
the
introduction
of
sex
physiology
in
many
schools
of
germany
scandinavia
like
germany
was
advanced
through
the
drama
much
more
than
through
any
other
channel
long
before
ibsen
appeared
on
the
scene
bjornson
the
great
essayist
thundered
against
the
inequalities
and
injustice
prevalent
in
those
countries
but
his
was
a
voice
in
the
wilderness
reaching
but
the
few
not
so
with
ibsen
his
brand
doll
house
pillars
of
society
ghosts
and
an
enemy
of
the
people
have
considerably
undermined
the
old
conceptions
and
replaced
them
by
a
modern
and
real
view
of
life
one
has
but
to
read
brand
to
realize
the
modern
conception
let
us
say
of
religion
religion
as
an
ideal
to
be
achieved
on
earth
religion
as
a
principle
of
human
brotherhood
of
solidarity
and
kindness
ibsen
the
supreme
hater
of
all
social
shams
has
torn
the
veil
of
hypocrisy
from
their
faces
his
greatest
onslaught
however
is
on
the
four
cardinal
points
supporting
the
flimsy
network
of
society
first
the
lie
upon
which
rests
the
life
of
today
second
the
futility
of
sacrifice
as
preached
by
our
moral
codes
third
petty
material
consideration
which
is
the
only
god
the
majority
worships
and
fourth
the
deadening
influence
of
provincialism
these
four
recur
as
the
leitmotif
in
ibsen
plays
but
particularly
in
pillars
of
society
doll
house
ghosts
and
an
enemy
of
the
people
pillars
of
society
what
a
tremendous
indictment
against
the
social
structure
that
rests
on
rotten
and
decayed
pillars
pillars
nicely
gilded
and
apparently
intact
yet
merely
hiding
their
true
condition
and
what
are
these
pillars
consul
bernick
at
the
very
height
of
his
social
and
financial
career
the
benefactor
of
his
town
and
the
strongest
pillar
of
the
community
has
reached
the
summit
through
the
channel
of
lies
deception
and
fraud
he
has
robbed
his
bosom
friend
johann
of
his
good
name
and
has
betrayed
lona
hessel
the
woman
he
loved
to
marry
her
for
the
sake
of
her
money
he
has
enriched
himself
by
shady
transactions
under
cover
of
the
community
good
and
finally
even
goes
to
the
extent
of
endangering
human
life
by
preparing
the
indian
girl
a
rotten
and
dangerous
vessel
to
go
to
sea
but
the
return
of
lona
brings
him
the
realization
of
the
emptiness
and
meanness
of
his
narrow
life
he
seeks
to
placate
the
waking
conscience
by
the
hope
that
he
has
cleared
the
ground
for
the
better
life
of
his
son
of
the
new
generation
but
even
this
last
hope
soon
falls
to
the
ground
as
he
realizes
that
truth
can
not
be
built
on
a
lie
at
the
very
moment
when
the
whole
town
is
prepared
to
celebrate
the
great
benefactor
of
the
community
with
banquet
praise
he
himself
now
grown
to
full
spiritual
manhood
confesses
to
the
assembled
townspeople
i
have
no
right
to
this
homage
my
must
know
me
to
the
core
then
let
everyone
examine
himself
and
let
us
realize
the
prediction
that
from
this
event
we
begin
a
new
time
the
old
with
its
tinsel
its
hypocrisy
its
hollowness
its
lying
propriety
and
its
pitiful
cowardice
shall
lie
behind
us
like
a
museum
open
for
instruction
with
a
doll
house
ibsen
has
paved
the
way
for
woman
emancipation
nora
awakens
from
her
doll
role
to
the
realization
of
the
injustice
done
her
by
her
father
and
her
husband
helmer
torvald
while
i
was
at
home
with
father
he
used
to
tell
me
all
his
opinions
and
i
held
the
same
opinions
if
i
had
others
i
concealed
them
because
he
would
not
have
approved
he
used
to
call
me
his
doll
child
and
play
with
me
as
i
played
with
my
dolls
then
i
came
to
live
in
your
house
you
settled
everything
according
to
your
taste
and
i
got
the
same
taste
as
you
or
i
pretended
to
when
i
look
back
on
it
now
i
seem
to
have
been
living
like
a
beggar
from
hand
to
mouth
i
lived
by
performing
tricks
for
you
torvald
but
you
would
have
it
so
you
and
father
have
done
me
a
great
wrong
in
vain
helmer
uses
the
old
philistine
arguments
of
wifely
duty
and
social
obligations
nora
has
grown
out
of
her
doll
dress
into
full
stature
of
conscious
womanhood
she
is
determined
to
think
and
judge
for
herself
she
has
realized
that
before
all
else
she
is
a
human
being
owing
the
first
duty
to
herself
she
is
undaunted
even
by
the
possibility
of
social
ostracism
she
has
become
sceptical
of
the
justice
of
the
law
the
wisdom
of
the
constituted
her
rebelling
soul
rises
in
protest
against
the
existing
in
her
own
words
i
must
make
up
my
mind
which
is
right
society
or
i
in
her
childlike
faith
in
her
husband
she
had
hoped
for
the
great
miracle
but
it
was
not
the
disappointed
hope
that
opened
her
vision
to
the
falsehoods
of
marriage
it
was
rather
the
smug
contentment
of
helmer
with
a
safe
lie
one
that
would
remain
hidden
and
not
endanger
his
social
standing
when
nora
closed
behind
her
the
door
of
her
gilded
cage
and
went
out
into
the
world
a
new
regenerated
personality
she
opened
the
gate
of
freedom
and
truth
for
her
own
sex
and
the
race
to
come
more
than
any
other
play
ghosts
has
acted
like
a
bomb
explosion
shaking
the
social
structure
to
its
very
foundations
in
doll
house
the
justification
of
the
union
between
nora
and
helmer
rested
at
least
on
the
husband
conception
of
integrity
and
rigid
adherence
to
our
social
morality
indeed
he
was
the
conventional
ideal
husband
and
devoted
father
not
so
in
ghosts
alving
married
captain
alving
only
to
find
that
he
was
a
physical
and
mental
wreck
and
that
life
with
him
would
mean
utter
degradation
and
be
fatal
to
possible
offspring
in
her
despair
she
turned
to
her
youth
companion
young
pastor
manders
who
as
the
true
savior
of
souls
for
heaven
must
needs
be
indifferent
to
earthly
necessities
he
sent
her
back
to
shame
and
degradation
to
her
duties
to
husband
and
home
indeed
happiness
to
him
was
but
the
unholy
manifestation
of
a
rebellious
spirit
and
a
wife
duty
was
not
to
judge
but
to
bear
with
humility
the
cross
which
a
higher
power
had
for
your
own
good
laid
upon
you
alving
bore
the
cross
for
long
years
not
for
the
sake
of
the
higher
power
but
for
her
little
son
oswald
whom
she
longed
to
save
from
the
poisonous
atmosphere
of
her
husband
home
it
was
also
for
the
sake
of
the
beloved
son
that
she
supported
the
lie
of
his
father
goodness
in
superstitious
awe
of
duty
and
decency
she
learned
alas
too
late
that
the
sacrifice
of
her
entire
life
had
been
in
vain
and
that
her
son
oswald
was
visited
by
the
sins
of
his
father
that
he
was
irrevocably
doomed
this
too
she
learned
that
we
are
all
of
us
ghosts
it
is
not
only
what
we
have
inherited
from
our
father
and
mother
that
walks
in
us
it
is
all
sorts
of
dead
ideas
and
lifeless
old
beliefs
they
have
no
vitality
but
they
cling
to
us
all
the
same
and
we
ca
get
rid
of
them
and
then
we
are
one
and
all
so
pitifully
afraid
of
light
when
you
forced
me
under
the
yoke
you
called
duty
and
obligation
when
you
praised
as
right
and
proper
what
my
whole
soul
rebelled
against
as
something
loathsome
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
look
into
the
seams
of
your
doctrine
i
only
wished
to
pick
at
a
single
knot
but
when
i
had
got
that
undone
the
whole
thing
ravelled
out
and
then
i
understood
that
it
was
all
how
could
a
society
fathom
the
seething
depths
whence
issued
the
great
masterpiece
of
henrik
ibsen
it
could
not
understand
and
therefore
it
poured
the
vials
of
abuse
and
venom
upon
its
greatest
benefactor
that
ibsen
was
not
daunted
he
has
proved
by
his
reply
in
an
enemy
of
the
people
in
that
great
drama
ibsen
performs
the
last
funeral
rites
over
a
decaying
and
dying
social
system
out
of
its
ashes
rises
the
regenerated
individual
the
bold
and
daring
rebel
stockman
an
idealist
full
of
social
sympathy
and
solidarity
is
called
to
his
native
town
as
the
physician
of
the
baths
he
soon
discovers
that
the
latter
are
built
on
a
swamp
and
that
instead
of
finding
relief
the
patients
who
flock
to
the
place
are
being
poisoned
an
honest
man
of
strong
convictions
the
doctor
considers
it
his
duty
to
make
his
discovery
known
but
he
soon
learns
that
dividends
and
profits
are
concerned
neither
with
health
nor
principles
even
the
reformers
of
the
town
represented
in
the
people
messenger
always
ready
to
prate
of
their
devotion
to
the
people
withdraw
their
support
from
the
reckless
idealist
the
moment
they
learn
that
the
doctor
discovery
may
bring
the
town
into
disrepute
and
thus
injure
their
pockets
but
doctor
stockman
continues
in
the
faith
he
entertains
for
has
townsmen
they
would
hear
him
but
here
too
he
soon
finds
himself
alone
he
can
not
even
secure
a
place
to
proclaim
his
great
truth
and
when
he
finally
succeeds
he
is
overwhelmed
by
abuse
and
ridicule
as
the
enemy
of
the
people
the
doctor
so
enthusiastic
of
his
townspeople
assistance
to
eradicate
the
evil
is
soon
driven
to
a
solitary
position
the
announcement
of
his
discovery
would
result
in
a
pecuniary
loss
to
the
town
and
that
consideration
induces
the
officials
the
good
citizens
and
soul
reformers
to
stifle
the
voice
of
truth
he
finds
them
all
a
compact
majority
unscrupulous
enough
to
be
willing
to
build
up
the
prosperity
of
the
town
on
a
quagmire
of
lies
and
fraud
he
is
accused
of
trying
to
ruin
the
community
but
to
his
mind
it
does
not
matter
if
a
lying
community
is
ruined
it
must
be
levelled
to
the
ground
all
men
who
live
upon
lies
must
be
exterminated
like
vermin
you
bring
it
to
such
a
pass
that
the
whole
country
will
deserve
to
perish
doctor
stockman
is
not
a
practical
politician
a
free
man
he
thinks
must
not
behave
like
a
blackguard
he
must
not
so
act
that
he
would
spit
in
his
own
face
for
only
cowards
permit
considerations
of
pretended
general
welfare
or
of
party
to
override
truth
and
ideals
party
programmes
wring
the
necks
of
all
young
living
truths
and
considerations
of
expediency
turn
morality
and
righteousness
upside
down
until
life
is
simply
hideous
these
plays
of
ibsen
the
pillars
of
society
a
doll
house
ghosts
and
an
enemy
of
the
people
constitute
a
dynamic
force
which
is
gradually
dissipating
the
ghosts
walking
the
social
burying
ground
called
civilization
nay
more
ibsen
destructive
effects
are
at
the
same
time
supremely
constructive
for
he
not
merely
undermines
existing
pillars
indeed
he
builds
with
sure
strokes
the
foundation
of
a
healthier
ideal
future
based
on
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
within
a
sympathetic
social
environment
england
with
her
great
pioneers
of
radical
thought
the
intellectual
pilgrims
like
godwin
robert
owen
darwin
spencer
william
morris
and
scores
of
others
with
her
wonderful
larks
of
liberty
shelley
byron
keats
is
another
example
of
the
influence
of
dramatic
art
within
comparatively
a
few
years
the
dramatic
works
of
shaw
pinero
galsworthy
rann
kennedy
have
carried
radical
thought
to
the
ears
formerly
deaf
even
to
great
britain
wondrous
poets
thus
a
public
which
will
remain
indifferent
reading
an
essay
by
robert
owen
on
poverty
or
ignore
bernard
shaw
socialistic
tracts
was
made
to
think
by
major
barbara
wherein
poverty
is
described
as
the
greatest
crime
of
christian
civilization
poverty
makes
people
weak
slavish
puny
poverty
creates
disease
crime
prostitution
in
fine
poverty
is
responsible
for
all
the
ills
and
evils
of
the
world
poverty
also
necessitates
dependency
charitable
organizations
institutions
that
thrive
off
the
very
thing
they
are
trying
to
destroy
the
salvation
army
for
instance
as
shown
in
major
barbara
fights
drunkenness
yet
one
of
its
greatest
contributors
is
badger
a
whiskey
distiller
who
furnishes
yearly
thousands
of
pounds
to
do
away
with
the
very
source
of
his
wealth
bernard
shaw
therefore
concludes
that
the
only
real
benefactor
of
society
is
a
man
like
undershaft
barbara
father
a
cannon
manufacturer
whose
theory
of
life
is
that
powder
is
stronger
than
words
the
worst
of
crimes
says
undershaft
is
poverty
all
the
other
crimes
are
virtues
beside
it
all
the
other
dishonors
are
chivalry
itself
by
comparison
poverty
blights
whole
cities
spreads
horrible
pestilences
strikes
dead
the
very
soul
of
all
who
come
within
sight
sound
or
smell
of
it
what
you
call
crime
is
nothing
a
murder
here
a
theft
there
a
blow
now
and
a
curse
there
what
do
they
matter
they
are
only
the
accidents
and
illnesses
of
life
there
are
not
fifty
genuine
professional
criminals
in
london
but
there
are
millions
of
poor
people
abject
people
dirty
people
people
they
poison
us
morally
and
physically
they
kill
the
happiness
of
society
they
force
us
to
do
away
with
our
own
liberties
and
to
organize
unnatural
cruelties
for
fear
they
should
rise
against
us
and
drag
us
down
into
their
abyss
poverty
and
slavery
have
stood
up
for
centuries
to
your
sermons
and
leading
articles
they
will
not
stand
up
to
my
machine
guns
do
preach
at
them
do
reason
with
them
kill
them
it
is
the
final
test
of
conviction
the
only
lever
strong
enough
to
overturn
a
social
system
vote
bah
when
you
vote
you
only
change
the
name
of
the
cabinet
when
you
shoot
you
pull
down
governments
inaugurate
new
epochs
abolish
old
orders
and
set
up
new
no
wonder
people
cared
little
to
read
shaw
socialistic
tracts
in
no
other
way
but
in
the
drama
could
he
deliver
such
forcible
historic
truths
and
therefore
it
is
only
through
the
drama
that
shaw
is
a
revolutionary
factor
in
the
dissemination
of
radical
ideas
after
hauptmann
die
weber
strife
by
galsworthy
is
the
most
important
labor
drama
the
theme
of
strife
is
a
strike
with
two
dominant
factors
anthony
the
president
of
the
company
rigid
uncompromising
unwilling
to
make
the
slightest
concession
although
the
men
held
out
for
months
and
are
in
a
condition
of
and
david
roberts
an
uncompromising
revolutionist
whose
devotion
to
the
workingman
and
the
cause
of
freedom
is
at
white
heat
between
them
the
strikers
are
worn
and
weary
with
the
terrible
struggle
and
are
harassed
and
driven
by
the
awful
sight
of
poverty
and
want
in
their
families
the
most
marvellous
and
brilliant
piece
of
work
in
strife
is
galsworthy
portrayal
of
the
mob
its
fickleness
and
lack
of
backbone
one
moment
they
applaud
old
thomas
who
speaks
of
the
power
of
god
and
religion
and
admonishes
the
men
against
rebellion
the
next
instant
they
are
carried
away
by
a
walking
delegate
who
pleads
the
cause
of
the
union
the
union
that
always
stands
for
compromise
and
which
forsakes
the
workingmen
whenever
they
dare
to
strike
for
independent
demands
again
they
are
aglow
with
the
earnestness
the
spirit
and
the
intensity
of
david
roberts
all
these
people
willing
to
go
in
whatever
direction
the
wind
blows
it
is
the
curse
of
the
working
class
that
they
always
follow
like
sheep
led
to
slaughter
consistency
is
the
greatest
crime
of
our
commercial
age
no
matter
how
intense
the
spirit
or
how
important
the
man
the
moment
he
will
not
allow
himself
to
be
used
or
sell
his
principles
he
is
thrown
on
the
dustheap
such
was
the
fate
of
the
president
of
the
company
anthony
and
of
david
roberts
to
be
sure
they
represented
opposite
poles
poles
antagonistic
to
each
other
poles
divided
by
a
terrible
gap
that
can
never
be
bridged
over
yet
they
shared
a
common
fate
anthony
is
the
embodiment
of
conservatism
of
old
ideas
of
iron
methods
i
have
been
chairman
of
this
company
years
i
have
fought
the
men
four
times
i
have
never
been
defeated
it
has
been
said
that
times
have
changed
if
they
have
i
have
not
changed
with
them
it
has
been
said
that
masters
and
men
are
equal
cant
there
can
be
only
one
master
in
a
house
it
has
been
said
that
capital
and
labor
have
the
same
interests
cant
their
interests
are
as
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
there
is
only
one
way
of
treating
men
with
the
iron
rod
masters
are
masters
men
are
men
we
may
not
like
this
adherence
to
old
reactionary
notions
and
yet
there
is
something
admirable
in
the
courage
and
consistency
of
this
man
nor
is
he
half
as
dangerous
to
the
interests
of
the
oppressed
as
our
sentimental
and
soft
reformers
who
rob
with
nine
fingers
and
give
libraries
with
the
tenth
who
grind
human
beings
like
russell
sage
and
then
spend
millions
of
dollars
in
social
research
work
who
turn
beautiful
young
plants
into
faded
old
women
and
then
give
them
a
few
paltry
dollars
or
found
a
home
for
working
girls
anthony
is
a
worthy
foe
and
to
fight
such
a
foe
one
must
learn
to
meet
him
in
open
battle
david
roberts
has
all
the
mental
and
moral
attributes
of
his
adversary
coupled
with
the
spirit
of
revolt
and
the
depth
of
modern
ideas
he
too
is
consistent
and
wants
nothing
for
his
class
short
of
complete
victory
it
is
not
for
this
little
moment
of
time
we
are
fighting
not
for
our
own
little
bodies
and
their
warmth
it
is
for
all
those
who
come
after
for
all
times
oh
men
for
the
love
of
them
do
turn
up
another
stone
on
their
heads
do
help
to
blacken
the
sky
if
we
can
shake
that
monster
with
the
bloody
lips
that
has
sucked
the
lives
out
of
ourselves
our
wives
and
children
since
the
world
began
if
we
have
not
the
hearts
of
men
to
stand
against
it
breast
to
breast
and
eye
to
eye
and
force
it
backward
till
it
cry
for
mercy
it
will
go
on
sucking
life
and
we
shall
stay
forever
where
we
are
less
than
the
very
dogs
it
is
inevitable
that
compromise
and
petty
interest
should
pass
on
and
leave
two
such
giants
behind
inevitable
until
the
mass
will
reach
the
stature
of
a
david
roberts
will
it
ever
prophecy
is
not
the
vocation
of
the
dramatist
yet
the
moral
lesson
is
evident
one
can
not
help
realizing
that
the
workingmen
will
have
to
use
methods
hitherto
unfamiliar
to
them
that
they
will
have
to
discard
all
those
elements
in
their
midst
that
are
forever
ready
to
reconcile
the
irreconcilable
namely
capital
and
labor
they
will
have
to
learn
that
characters
like
david
roberts
are
the
very
forces
that
have
revolutionized
the
world
and
thus
paved
the
way
for
emancipation
out
of
the
clutches
of
that
monster
with
bloody
lips
towards
a
brighter
horizon
a
freer
life
and
a
deeper
recognition
of
human
values
no
subject
of
equal
social
import
has
received
such
extensive
consideration
within
the
last
few
years
as
the
question
of
prison
and
punishment
hardly
any
magazine
of
consequence
that
has
not
devoted
its
columns
to
the
discussion
of
this
vital
theme
a
number
of
books
by
able
writers
both
in
america
and
abroad
have
discussed
this
topic
from
the
historic
psychologic
and
social
standpoint
all
agreeing
that
present
penal
institutions
and
our
mode
of
coping
with
crime
have
in
every
respect
proved
inadequate
as
well
as
wasteful
one
would
expect
that
something
very
radical
should
result
from
the
cumulative
literary
indictment
of
the
social
crimes
perpetrated
upon
the
prisoner
yet
with
the
exception
of
a
few
minor
and
comparatively
insignificant
reforms
in
some
of
our
prisons
absolutely
nothing
has
been
accomplished
but
at
last
this
grave
social
wrong
has
found
dramatic
interpretation
in
galworthy
justice
the
play
opens
in
the
office
of
james
how
and
sons
solicitors
the
senior
clerk
robert
cokeson
discovers
that
a
check
he
had
issued
for
nine
pounds
has
been
forged
to
ninety
by
elimination
suspicion
falls
upon
william
falder
the
junior
office
clerk
the
latter
is
in
love
with
a
married
woman
the
abused
wife
of
a
brutal
drunkard
pressed
by
his
employer
a
severe
yet
not
unkindly
man
falder
confesses
the
forgery
pleading
the
dire
necessity
of
his
sweetheart
ruth
honeywill
with
whom
he
had
planned
to
escape
to
save
her
from
the
unbearable
brutality
of
her
husband
notwithstanding
the
entreaties
of
young
walter
who
is
touched
by
modern
ideas
his
father
a
moral
and
citizen
turns
falder
over
to
the
police
the
second
act
in
the
shows
justice
in
the
very
process
of
manufacture
the
scene
equals
in
dramatic
power
and
psychologic
verity
the
great
court
scene
in
resurrection
young
falder
a
nervous
and
rather
weakly
youth
of
stands
before
the
bar
ruth
his
married
sweetheart
full
of
love
and
devotion
burns
with
anxiety
to
save
the
young
man
whose
affection
brought
about
his
present
predicament
the
young
man
is
defended
by
lawyer
frome
whose
speech
to
the
jury
is
a
masterpiece
of
deep
social
philosophy
wreathed
with
the
tendrils
of
human
understanding
and
sympathy
he
does
not
attempt
to
dispute
the
mere
fact
of
falder
having
altered
the
check
and
though
he
pleads
temporary
aberration
in
defense
of
his
client
that
plea
is
based
upon
a
social
consciousness
as
deep
and
as
the
roots
of
our
social
ills
the
background
of
life
that
palpitating
life
which
always
lies
behind
the
commission
of
a
crime
he
shows
falder
to
have
faced
the
alternative
of
seeing
the
beloved
woman
murdered
by
her
brutal
husband
whom
she
can
not
divorce
or
of
taking
the
law
into
his
own
hands
the
defence
pleads
with
the
jury
not
to
turn
the
weak
young
man
into
a
criminal
by
condemning
him
to
prison
for
justice
is
a
machine
that
when
someone
has
given
it
a
starting
push
rolls
on
of
itself
is
this
young
man
to
be
ground
to
pieces
under
this
machine
for
an
act
which
at
the
worst
was
one
of
weakness
is
he
to
become
a
member
of
the
luckless
crews
that
man
those
dark
ships
called
prisons
i
urge
you
gentlemen
do
not
ruin
this
young
man
for
as
a
result
of
those
four
minutes
ruin
utter
and
irretrievable
stares
him
in
the
face
the
rolling
of
the
chariot
wheels
of
justice
over
this
boy
began
when
it
was
decided
to
prosecute
him
but
the
chariot
of
justice
rolls
mercilessly
on
for
as
the
learned
judge
says
the
law
is
what
it
is
a
majestic
edifice
sheltering
all
of
us
each
stone
of
which
rests
on
another
falder
is
sentenced
to
three
years
penal
servitude
in
prison
the
young
inexperienced
convict
soon
finds
himself
the
victim
of
the
terrible
system
the
authorities
admit
that
young
falder
is
mentally
and
physically
in
bad
shape
but
nothing
can
be
done
in
the
matter
many
others
are
in
a
similar
position
and
the
quarters
are
inadequate
the
third
scene
of
the
third
act
is
in
its
silent
force
the
whole
scene
is
a
pantomime
taking
place
in
prison
cell
in
daylight
falder
in
his
stockings
is
seen
standing
motionless
with
his
head
inclined
towards
the
door
listening
he
moves
a
little
closer
to
the
door
his
stockinged
feet
making
no
noise
he
stops
at
the
door
he
is
trying
harder
and
harder
to
hear
something
any
little
thing
that
is
going
on
outside
he
springs
suddenly
upright
as
if
at
a
sound
and
remains
perfectly
motionless
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
moves
to
his
work
and
stands
looking
at
it
with
his
head
down
he
does
a
stitch
or
two
having
the
air
of
a
man
so
lost
in
sadness
that
each
stitch
is
as
it
were
a
coming
to
life
then
turning
abruptly
he
begins
pacing
his
cell
moving
his
head
like
an
animal
pacing
its
cage
he
stops
again
at
the
door
listens
and
placing
the
palms
of
his
hands
against
it
with
his
fingers
spread
out
leans
his
forehead
against
the
iron
turning
from
it
presently
he
moves
slowly
back
towards
the
window
holding
his
head
as
if
he
felt
that
it
were
going
to
burst
and
stops
under
the
window
but
since
he
can
not
see
out
of
it
he
leaves
off
looking
and
picking
up
the
lid
of
one
of
the
tins
peers
into
it
as
if
trying
to
make
a
companion
of
his
own
face
it
has
grown
very
nearly
dark
suddenly
the
lid
falls
out
of
his
hand
with
a
clatter
the
only
sound
that
has
broken
the
silence
and
he
stands
staring
intently
at
the
wall
where
the
stuff
of
the
shirt
is
hanging
rather
white
in
the
darkness
he
seems
to
be
seeing
somebody
or
something
there
there
is
a
sharp
tap
and
click
the
cell
light
behind
the
glass
screen
has
been
turned
up
the
cell
is
brightly
lighted
falder
is
seen
gasping
for
breath
a
sound
from
far
away
as
of
distant
dull
beating
on
thick
metal
is
suddenly
audible
falder
shrinks
back
not
able
to
bear
this
sudden
clamor
but
the
sound
grows
as
though
some
great
tumbril
were
rolling
towards
the
cell
and
gradually
it
seems
to
hypnotize
him
he
begins
creeping
inch
by
inch
nearer
to
the
door
the
banging
sound
traveling
from
cell
to
cell
draws
closer
and
closer
hands
are
seen
moving
as
if
his
spirit
had
already
joined
in
this
beating
and
the
sound
swells
till
it
seems
to
have
entered
the
very
cell
he
suddenly
raises
his
clenched
fists
panting
violently
he
flings
himself
at
his
door
and
beats
on
it
finally
falder
leaves
the
prison
a
broken
man
the
stamp
of
the
convict
upon
his
brow
the
iron
of
misery
in
his
soul
thanks
to
ruth
pleading
the
firm
of
james
how
and
son
is
willing
to
take
falder
back
in
their
employ
on
condition
that
he
give
up
ruth
it
is
then
that
falder
learns
the
awful
news
that
the
woman
he
loves
had
been
driven
by
the
merciless
economic
moloch
to
sell
herself
she
tried
making
skirts
cheap
things
i
never
made
more
than
ten
shillings
a
week
buying
my
own
cotton
and
working
all
day
i
hardly
ever
got
to
bed
till
past
twelve
and
then
my
employer
happened
he
happened
ever
since
at
this
terrible
psychologic
moment
the
police
appear
to
drag
him
back
to
prison
for
failing
to
report
himself
as
man
completely
overwhelmed
by
the
inexorability
of
his
environment
young
falder
seeks
and
finds
peace
greater
than
human
justice
by
throwing
himself
down
to
death
as
the
detectives
are
taking
him
back
to
prison
it
would
be
impossible
to
estimate
the
effect
produced
by
this
play
perhaps
some
conception
can
be
gained
from
the
very
unusual
circumstance
that
it
had
proved
so
powerful
as
to
induce
the
home
secretary
of
great
britain
to
undertake
extensive
prison
reforms
in
england
a
very
encouraging
sign
this
of
the
influence
exerted
by
the
modern
drama
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
thundering
indictment
of
galsworthy
will
not
remain
without
similar
effect
upon
the
public
sentiment
and
prison
conditions
of
america
at
any
rate
it
is
certain
that
no
other
modern
play
has
borne
such
direct
and
immediate
fruit
in
wakening
the
social
conscience
another
modern
play
the
servant
in
the
house
strikes
a
vital
key
in
our
social
life
the
hero
of
kennedy
masterpiece
is
robert
a
coarse
filthy
drunkard
whom
respectable
society
has
repudiated
robert
the
sewer
cleaner
is
the
real
hero
of
the
play
nay
its
true
and
only
savior
it
is
he
who
volunteers
to
go
down
into
the
dangerous
sewer
so
that
his
comrades
can
light
and
air
after
all
has
he
not
sacrificed
his
life
always
so
that
others
may
have
light
and
air
the
thought
that
labor
is
the
redeemer
of
social
has
been
cried
from
the
housetops
in
every
tongue
and
every
clime
yet
the
simple
words
of
robert
express
the
significance
of
labor
and
its
mission
with
far
greater
potency
america
is
still
in
its
dramatic
infancy
most
of
the
attempts
along
this
line
to
mirror
life
have
been
wretched
failures
still
there
are
hopeful
signs
in
the
attitude
of
the
intelligent
public
toward
modern
plays
even
if
they
be
from
foreign
soil
the
only
real
drama
america
has
so
far
produced
is
the
easiest
way
by
eugene
walter
it
is
supposed
to
represent
a
peculiar
phase
of
new
york
life
if
that
were
all
it
would
be
of
minor
significance
that
which
gives
the
play
its
real
importance
and
value
lies
much
deeper
it
lies
first
in
the
fundamental
current
of
our
social
fabric
which
drives
us
all
even
stronger
characters
than
laura
into
the
easiest
way
a
way
so
very
destructive
of
integrity
truth
and
justice
secondly
the
cruel
senseless
fatalism
conditioned
in
laura
sex
these
two
features
put
the
universal
stamp
upon
the
play
and
characterize
it
as
one
of
the
strongest
dramatic
indictments
against
society
the
criminal
waste
of
human
energy
in
economic
and
social
conditions
drives
laura
as
it
drives
the
average
girl
to
marry
any
man
for
a
home
or
as
it
drives
men
to
endure
the
worst
indignities
for
a
miserable
pittance
then
there
is
that
other
respectable
institution
the
fatalism
of
laura
sex
the
inevitability
of
that
force
is
summed
up
in
the
following
words
do
you
know
that
we
count
no
more
in
the
life
of
these
men
than
tamed
animals
it
a
game
and
if
we
do
play
our
cards
well
we
lose
woman
in
the
battle
with
life
has
but
one
weapon
one
commodity
sex
that
alone
serves
as
a
trump
card
in
the
game
of
life
this
blind
fatalism
has
made
of
woman
a
parasite
an
inert
thing
why
then
expect
perseverance
or
energy
of
laura
the
easiest
way
is
the
path
mapped
out
for
her
from
time
immemorial
she
could
follow
no
other
a
number
of
other
plays
could
be
quoted
as
characteristic
of
the
growing
role
of
the
drama
as
a
disseminator
of
radical
thought
suffice
to
mention
the
third
degree
by
charles
klein
the
fourth
estate
by
medill
patterson
a
man
world
by
ida
croutchers
all
pointing
to
the
dawn
of
dramatic
art
in
america
an
art
which
is
discovering
to
the
people
the
terrible
diseases
of
our
social
body
it
has
been
said
of
old
all
roads
lead
to
rome
in
paraphrased
application
to
the
tendencies
of
our
day
it
may
truly
be
said
that
all
roads
lead
to
the
great
social
reconstruction
the
economic
awakening
of
the
workingman
and
his
realization
of
the
necessity
for
concerted
industrial
action
the
tendencies
of
modern
education
especially
in
their
application
to
the
free
development
of
the
child
the
spirit
of
growing
unrest
expressed
through
and
cultivated
by
art
and
literature
all
pave
the
way
to
the
open
road
above
all
the
modern
drama
operating
through
the
double
channel
of
dramatist
and
interpreter
affecting
as
it
does
both
mind
and
heart
is
the
strongest
force
in
developing
social
discontent
swelling
the
powerful
tide
of
unrest
that
sweeps
onward
and
over
the
dam
of
ignorance
prejudice
and
superstition
