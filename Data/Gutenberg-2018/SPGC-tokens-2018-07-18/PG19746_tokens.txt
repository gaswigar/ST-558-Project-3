one

were
seated
one
march
morning
in
in
the
private
office
of
french
and
company
limited
on
lower
broadway
kirby
the
junior
partner
a
man
of
with
brown
hair
and
mustache
handsome
features
and
an
alert
manner
was
smoking
cigarettes
almost
as
fast
as
he
could
roll
them
and
at
the
same
time
watching
the
electric
clock
upon
the
wall
and
getting
up
now
and
then
to
stride
restlessly
back
and
forth
across
the
room
french
the
senior
partner
who
sat
opposite
kirby
was
an
older
man
a
safe
guess
would
have
placed
him
somewhere
in
the
debatable
ground
between
forty
and
fifty
of
a
good
height
as
could
be
seen
even
from
the
seated
figure
the
upper
part
of
which
was
held
erect
with
the
unconscious
ease
which
one
associates
with
military
training
his
closely
cropped
brown
hair
had
the
slightest
touch
of
gray
the
spacious
forehead
gray
eyes
and
firm
chin
scarcely
concealed
by
a
light
beard
marked
the
thoughtful
man
of
affairs
his
face
indeed
might
have
seemed
austere
but
for
a
sensitive
mouth
which
suggested
a
reserve
of
humour
and
a
capacity
for
deep
feeling
a
man
of
character
one
would
have
said
not
apt
to
undertake
anything
lightly
but
sure
to
go
far
in
whatever
he
took
in
hand
quickly
responsive
to
a
generous
impulse
and
capable
of
a
righteous
indignation
a
good
friend
a
dangerous
enemy
more
likely
to
be
misled
by
the
heart
than
by
the
head
of
the
salt
of
the
earth
which
gives
it
savour
french
sat
on
one
side
kirby
on
the
other
of
a
handsome
mahogany
desk
equipped
with
telephones
and
push
buttons
and
piled
with
papers
account
books
and
letter
files
in
orderly
array
in
marked
contrast
to
his
partner
nervousness
french
scarcely
moved
a
muscle
except
now
and
then
to
take
the
cigar
from
his
lips
and
knock
the
ashes
from
the
end
nine
fifty
ejaculated
kirby
comparing
the
clock
with
his
watch
only
ten
minutes
more
french
nodded
mechanically
outside
in
the
main
office
the
same
air
of
tense
expectancy
prevailed
for
two
weeks
the
office
force
had
been
busily
at
work
preparing
inventories
and
balance
sheets
the
firm
of
french
and
company
limited
manufacturers
of
crashes
and
burlaps
and
kindred
stuffs
with
extensive
mills
in
connecticut
and
central
offices
in
new
york
having
for
a
long
time
resisted
the
siren
voice
of
the
promoter
had
finally
faced
the
alternative
of
selling
out
at
a
sacrifice
to
the
recently
organised
bagging
trust
or
of
meeting
a
disastrous
competition
expecting
to
yield
in
the
end
they
had
fought
for
position
with
brilliant
results
negotiations
for
a
sale
upon
terms
highly
favourable
to
the
firm
had
been
in
progress
for
several
weeks
and
the
two
partners
were
awaiting
in
their
private
office
the
final
word
should
the
sale
be
completed
they
were
richer
men
than
they
could
have
hoped
to
be
after
ten
years
more
of
business
stress
and
struggle
should
it
fail
they
were
heavy
losers
for
their
fight
had
been
expensive
they
were
in
much
the
same
position
as
the
player
who
had
staked
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
on
the
cast
of
a
die
not
meaning
to
risk
so
much
they
had
been
drawn
into
it
but
the
game
was
worth
the
candle
nine
said
kirby
five
minutes
more
he
strode
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
it
was
snowing
and
the
march
wind
blowing
straight
up
broadway
from
the
bay
swept
the
white
flakes
northward
in
long
feathery
swirls
french
preserved
his
rigid
attitude
though
a
close
observer
might
have
wondered
whether
it
was
quite
natural
or
merely
the
result
of
a
supreme
effort
of
will
work
had
been
practically
suspended
in
the
outer
office
the
clerks
were
also
watching
the
clock
every
one
of
them
knew
that
the
board
of
directors
of
the
bagging
trust
was
in
session
and
that
at
ten
it
was
to
report
the
result
of
its
action
on
the
proposition
of
french
and
company
limited
the
clerks
were
not
especially
cheerful
the
impending
change
meant
for
them
at
best
a
change
of
masters
and
for
many
of
them
the
loss
of
employment
the
firm
for
relinquishing
its
business
and
good
will
would
receive
liberal
compensation
the
clerks
for
their
skill
experience
and
prospects
of
advancement
would
receive
their
discharge
what
else
could
be
expected
the
principal
reason
for
the
trust
existence
was
economy
of
administration
this
was
stated
most
convincingly
in
the
prospectus
there
was
no
suggestion
in
that
model
document
that
competition
would
be
crushed
or
that
monopoly
once
established
labour
must
sweat
and
the
public
groan
in
order
that
a
few
captains
or
chevaliers
of
industry
might
double
their
dividends
french
may
have
known
it
or
guessed
it
but
he
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
a
victim
rather
than
an
accessory
he
must
take
what
he
could
get
or
lose
what
he
had
nine
kirby
as
he
breathed
rather
than
spoke
the
words
threw
away
his
scarcely
lighted
cigarette
and
gripped
the
arms
of
his
chair
spasmodically
his
partner
attitude
had
not
varied
by
a
breadth
except
for
the
scarcely
perceptible
rise
and
fall
of
his
chest
he
might
have
been
a
wax
figure
the
pallor
of
his
countenance
would
have
strengthened
the
illusion
kirby
pushed
his
chair
back
and
sprung
to
his
feet
the
clock
marked
the
hour
but
nothing
happened
kirby
was
wont
to
say
thereafter
that
the
ten
minutes
that
followed
were
the
longest
day
of
his
life
but
everything
must
have
an
end
and
their
suspense
was
terminated
by
a
telephone
call
french
took
down
the
receiver
and
placed
it
to
his
ear
it
all
right
he
announced
looking
toward
his
partner
our
figures
accepted
resolution
adopted
settlement
we
are
the
receiver
fell
upon
the
table
with
a
crash
french
toppled
over
and
before
kirby
had
scarcely
realised
that
something
was
the
matter
had
sunk
unconscious
to
the
floor
which
fortunately
was
thickly
carpeted
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
for
kirby
to
loosen
his
collar
reach
into
the
recesses
of
a
certain
drawer
in
the
big
desk
draw
out
a
flask
of
brandy
and
pour
a
small
quantity
of
the
burning
liquid
down
the
unconscious
man
throat
a
push
on
one
of
the
electric
buttons
summoned
a
clerk
with
whose
aid
french
was
lifted
to
a
couch
that
stood
against
the
wall
almost
at
once
the
effect
of
the
stimulant
was
apparent
and
he
opened
his
eyes
i
suspect
he
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
a
smile
that
i
must
have
fainted
like
a
woman
perfectly
ridiculous
perfectly
natural
replied
his
partner
you
have
scarcely
slept
for
two
weeks
between
the
business
and
phil
and
you
reached
the
end
of
your
string
but
it
all
over
now
except
the
shouting
and
you
can
sleep
a
week
if
you
like
you
better
go
right
up
home
i
send
for
a
cab
and
call
moffatt
and
ask
him
to
be
at
the
hotel
by
the
time
you
reach
it
i
take
care
of
things
here
and
after
a
good
sleep
you
find
yourself
all
right
again
very
well
kirby
replied
french
i
feel
as
weak
as
water
but
i
all
here
it
might
have
been
much
worse
you
call
up
jerviss
of
course
and
let
her
know
about
the
sale
when
french
escorted
to
the
cab
by
his
partner
and
accompanied
by
a
clerk
had
left
for
home
kirby
rang
up
the
doctor
and
requested
him
to
look
after
french
immediately
he
then
called
for
another
number
and
after
the
usual
delay
first
because
the
exchange
girl
was
busy
and
then
because
the
line
was
busy
found
himself
in
communication
with
the
lady
for
whom
he
had
asked
it
all
right
jerviss
he
announced
without
preliminaries
our
terms
accepted
and
payment
to
be
made
in
cash
and
bonds
as
soon
as
the
papers
are
executed
when
you
will
be
twice
as
rich
as
you
are
thank
you
kirby
and
i
suppose
i
shall
never
have
another
happy
moment
until
i
know
what
to
do
with
it
money
is
a
great
trial
i
often
envy
the
poor
kirby
smiled
grimly
she
little
knew
how
near
she
had
been
to
ruin
the
active
partners
had
mercifully
shielded
her
as
far
as
possible
from
the
knowledge
of
their
common
danger
if
the
worst
happened
she
must
know
of
course
if
not
then
being
a
woman
whom
they
both
liked
she
would
be
spared
needless
anxiety
how
closely
they
had
skirted
the
edge
of
disaster
she
did
not
learn
until
afterward
indeed
kirby
himself
had
scarcely
appreciated
the
true
situation
and
even
the
senior
partner
since
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
trust
managers
could
not
know
what
had
been
in
their
minds
but
kirby
voice
gave
no
hint
of
these
reflections
he
laughed
a
cheerful
laugh
if
the
world
only
knew
he
rejoined
it
would
cease
to
worry
about
the
pains
of
poverty
and
weep
for
the
woes
of
wealth
indeed
it
would
she
replied
with
a
seriousness
which
seemed
almost
sincere
is
french
there
i
wish
to
thank
him
too
no
he
has
just
gone
home
at
this
hour
she
exclaimed
and
at
such
a
time
what
can
be
the
matter
is
phil
worse
no
i
think
not
french
himself
had
a
bad
turn
for
a
few
minutes
after
we
learned
the
news
faces
are
not
yet
visible
over
the
telephone
and
kirby
could
not
see
that
for
a
moment
the
lady
grew
white
but
when
she
spoke
again
the
note
of
concern
in
her
voice
was
very
evident
it
was
nothing
serious
oh
no
not
at
all
merely
overwork
and
lack
of
sleep
and
the
suspense
and
the
reaction
he
recovered
almost
immediately
and
one
of
the
clerks
went
home
with
him
has
moffatt
been
notified
she
asked
yes
i
called
him
up
at
once
he
be
at
the
mercedes
by
the
time
the
patient
arrives
there
was
a
little
further
conversation
on
matters
of
business
and
kirby
would
willingly
have
prolonged
it
but
his
news
about
french
had
plainly
disturbed
the
lady
equanimity
and
kirby
rang
off
after
arranging
to
call
to
see
her
in
person
after
business
hours
kirby
hung
up
the
receiver
with
something
of
a
sigh
a
fine
woman
he
murmured
i
could
envy
french
his
chances
though
he
does
seem
to
see
them
that
is
if
i
were
capable
of
envy
toward
so
fine
a
fellow
and
so
good
a
friend
it
curious
how
clearsighted
a
man
can
be
in
some
directions
and
how
blind
in
others
french
lived
at
the
mercedes
an
uptown
apartment
hotel
overlooking
central
park
he
had
scarcely
reached
his
apartment
when
the
doctor
arrived
a
tall
fair
fat
practitioner
and
one
of
the
best
in
new
york
a
gentleman
as
well
and
a
friend
of
french
my
dear
fellow
he
said
after
a
brief
examination
you
been
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
which
at
your
age
wo
do
at
all
no
indeed
no
indeed
you
always
worked
too
hard
and
you
been
worrying
too
much
about
the
boy
who
do
very
well
now
with
care
you
got
to
take
a
rest
it
all
you
need
you
confess
to
no
bad
habits
and
show
the
signs
of
none
and
you
have
a
fine
constitution
i
going
to
order
you
and
phil
away
for
three
months
to
some
mild
climate
where
you
be
free
from
business
cares
and
where
the
boy
can
grow
strong
without
having
to
fight
a
raw
eastern
spring
you
might
try
the
riviera
but
i
afraid
the
sea
would
be
too
much
for
phil
just
yet
or
southern
california
but
the
trip
is
tiresome
the
south
is
nearer
at
hand
there
palm
beach
or
jekyll
island
or
thomasville
asheville
or
aiken
somewhere
down
in
the
pine
country
it
will
be
just
the
thing
for
the
boy
lungs
and
just
the
place
for
you
to
rest
start
within
a
week
if
you
can
get
away
in
fact
to
get
away
french
was
too
weak
to
resist
both
body
and
mind
seemed
strangely
relaxed
and
there
was
really
no
reason
why
he
should
not
go
his
work
was
done
kirby
could
attend
to
the
formal
transfer
of
the
business
he
would
take
a
long
journey
to
some
pleasant
quiet
spot
where
he
and
phil
could
sleep
and
dream
and
ride
and
drive
and
grow
strong
and
enjoy
themselves
for
the
moment
he
felt
as
though
he
would
never
care
to
do
any
more
work
nor
would
he
need
to
for
he
was
rich
enough
he
would
live
for
the
boy
phil
education
his
health
his
happiness
his
establishment
in
life
these
would
furnish
occupation
enough
for
his
retirement
it
was
a
golden
moment
he
had
won
a
notable
victory
against
greed
and
craft
and
highly
trained
intelligence
and
yet
a
year
later
he
was
to
recall
this
recent
past
with
envy
and
regret
for
in
the
meantime
he
was
to
fight
another
battle
against
the
same
forces
and
others
quite
as
deeply
rooted
in
human
nature
but
he
was
to
fight
upon
a
new
field
and
with
different
weapons
and
with
results
which
could
not
be
foreseen
but
no
premonition
of
impending
struggle
disturbed
pleasant
reverie
it
was
broken
in
a
much
more
agreeable
manner
by
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
who
was
admitted
by
judson
french
man
the
visitor
was
a
handsome
woman
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
accompanied
by
another
and
a
plainer
woman
evidently
a
maid
or
companion
the
lady
was
dressed
with
the
most
expensive
simplicity
and
her
graceful
movements
were
attended
by
the
rustle
of
unseen
silks
in
passing
her
upon
the
street
any
man
under
ninety
would
have
looked
at
her
three
times
the
first
glance
instinctively
recognising
an
attractive
woman
the
second
ranking
her
as
a
lady
while
the
third
had
there
been
time
and
opportunity
would
have
been
the
long
lingering
look
of
respectful
or
regretful
admiration
how
is
french
judson
she
inquired
without
dissembling
her
anxiety
he
much
better
jerviss
thank
you
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
how
is
phil
quite
bright
you
hardly
know
that
he
been
sick
gaining
strength
rapidly
he
sleeps
a
great
deal
he
asleep
now
but
wo
you
step
into
the
library
there
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
i
let
french
know
you
are
here
but
french
who
had
overheard
part
of
the
colloquy
came
forward
from
an
adjoining
room
in
smoking
jacket
and
slippers
how
do
you
do
he
asked
extending
his
hand
it
was
mighty
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
and
i
awfully
glad
to
find
you
better
she
returned
giving
him
her
slender
gloved
hand
with
impulsive
warmth
i
might
have
telephoned
but
i
wanted
to
see
for
myself
i
felt
a
part
of
the
blame
to
be
mine
for
it
is
partly
for
me
you
know
that
you
have
been
overworking
it
was
all
in
the
game
he
said
and
we
have
won
but
sit
down
and
stay
awhile
i
know
you
pardon
my
smoking
jacket
we
are
partners
you
know
and
i
claim
an
invalid
privilege
as
well
the
lady
fine
eyes
beamed
and
her
fair
cheek
flushed
with
pleasure
had
he
only
realised
it
he
might
have
claimed
of
her
any
privilege
a
woman
can
properly
allow
even
that
of
conducting
her
to
the
altar
but
to
him
she
was
only
thus
far
as
she
had
been
for
a
long
time
a
very
good
friend
of
his
own
and
of
phil
a
former
partner
widow
who
had
retained
her
husband
interest
in
the
business
a
wholesome
handsome
woman
who
was
always
excellent
company
and
at
whose
table
he
had
often
eaten
both
before
and
since
her
husband
death
nor
despite
kirby
notions
was
he
entirely
ignorant
of
the
partiality
for
himself
doctor
moffatt
has
ordered
phil
and
me
away
for
three
months
he
said
after
jerviss
had
inquired
particularly
concerning
his
health
and
phil
three
months
she
exclaimed
with
an
accent
of
dismay
but
you
be
back
she
added
recovering
herself
quickly
before
the
vacation
season
opens
oh
certainly
we
shall
not
leave
the
country
where
are
you
going
the
doctor
has
prescribed
the
pine
woods
i
shall
visit
my
old
home
where
i
was
born
we
shall
leave
in
a
day
or
two
you
must
dine
with
me
she
said
warmly
and
tell
me
about
your
old
home
i
have
had
an
opportunity
to
thank
you
for
making
me
rich
and
i
want
your
advice
about
what
to
do
with
the
money
and
tiring
you
now
when
you
ought
to
be
resting
do
not
hurry
he
said
it
is
almost
a
pleasure
to
be
weak
and
helpless
since
it
gives
me
the
privilege
of
a
visit
from
you
she
lingered
a
few
moments
and
then
went
she
was
the
embodiment
of
good
taste
and
knew
when
to
come
and
when
to
go
french
was
conscious
that
her
visit
instead
of
tiring
him
had
had
an
opposite
effect
she
had
come
and
gone
like
a
pleasant
breeze
bearing
sweet
odours
and
the
echo
of
distant
music
her
shapely
hand
when
it
had
touched
his
own
had
been
soft
but
firm
and
he
had
almost
wished
as
he
held
it
for
a
moment
that
he
might
feel
it
resting
on
his
still
somewhat
fevered
brow
when
he
came
back
from
the
south
he
would
see
a
good
deal
of
her
either
at
the
seaside
or
wherever
she
might
spend
the
summer
when
french
and
phil
were
ready
a
day
or
two
later
to
start
upon
their
journey
kirby
was
at
the
mercedes
to
see
them
off
you
taking
judson
with
you
to
look
after
the
boy
he
asked
no
replied
french
judson
is
in
love
and
does
not
wish
to
leave
new
york
he
will
take
a
vacation
until
we
return
phil
and
i
can
get
along
very
well
alone
kirby
went
with
them
across
the
ferry
to
the
jersey
side
and
through
the
station
gates
to
the
waiting
train
there
was
a
flurry
of
snow
in
the
air
and
overcoats
were
comfortable
when
french
had
turned
over
his
hand
luggage
to
the
porter
of
the
pullman
they
walked
up
and
down
the
station
platform
i
looking
for
something
to
interest
us
said
kirby
rolling
a
cigarette
there
a
mining
proposition
in
utah
and
a
trolley
railroad
in
oklahoma
when
things
are
settled
up
here
i
take
a
run
out
and
look
the
ground
over
and
write
to
you
my
dear
fellow
said
his
friend
do
hurry
why
should
i
make
any
more
money
i
have
all
i
shall
ever
need
and
as
much
as
will
be
good
for
phil
if
you
find
a
good
thing
i
can
help
you
finance
it
and
jerviss
will
welcome
a
good
investment
but
i
shall
take
a
long
rest
and
then
travel
for
a
year
or
two
and
after
that
settle
down
and
take
life
comfortably
that
the
way
you
feel
now
replied
kirby
lighting
another
cigarette
but
wait
until
you
are
rested
and
you
yearn
for
the
fray
the
first
million
only
whets
the
appetite
for
more
all
aboard
the
word
was
passed
along
the
line
of
cars
kirby
took
leave
of
phil
into
whose
hand
he
had
thrust
a
bill
to
buy
popcorn
on
the
train
he
said
kissed
the
boy
and
wrung
his
hand
warmly
he
said
and
good
luck
you
hear
from
me
soon
partners
still
you
and
i
and
mrs
jerviss
and
though
french
smiled
acquiescence
and
returned
kirby
hand
clasp
with
equal
vigour
and
sincerity
he
felt
as
the
train
rolled
away
as
one
might
feel
who
after
a
long
sojourn
in
an
alien
land
at
last
takes
ship
for
home
the
mere
act
of
leaving
new
york
after
the
severance
of
all
compelling
ties
seemed
to
set
in
motion
old
currents
of
feeling
which
moving
slowly
at
the
start
gathered
momentum
as
the
miles
rolled
by
until
his
heart
leaped
forward
to
the
old
southern
town
which
was
his
destination
and
he
soon
felt
himself
chafing
impatiently
at
any
delay
that
threatened
to
throw
the
train
behind
schedule
time
he
be
back
in
six
weeks
declared
kirby
when
jerviss
and
he
next
met
i
know
him
well
he
ca
live
without
his
club
and
his
counting
room
it
is
hard
to
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
and
i
sure
he
not
stay
away
longer
than
three
months
said
the
lady
confidently
for
i
have
invited
him
to
my
house
party
a
privilege
said
kirby
gallantly
for
which
many
a
man
would
come
from
the
other
end
of
the
world
but
they
were
both
mistaken
for
even
as
they
spoke
he
whose
future
each
was
planning
was
entering
upon
a
new
life
of
his
own
from
which
he
was
to
look
back
upon
his
business
career
as
a
mere
period
of
preparation
for
the
real
end
and
purpose
of
his
earthly
existence
the
hack
which
the
colonel
had
taken
at
the
station
after
a
journey
broken
by
several
long
waits
for
connecting
trains
jogged
in
somewhat
leisurely
fashion
down
the
main
street
toward
the
hotel
the
colonel
with
his
little
boy
had
left
the
main
line
of
railroad
leading
north
and
south
and
had
taken
at
a
certain
way
station
the
one
daily
train
for
clarendon
with
which
the
express
made
connection
they
had
completed
the
journey
in
two
or
three
hours
arriving
at
clarendon
at
noon
it
was
an
auspicious
moment
for
visiting
the
town
it
is
true
that
the
grass
grew
in
the
street
here
and
there
but
the
sidewalks
were
separated
from
the
roadway
by
rows
of
oaks
and
elms
and
in
early
leaf
the
travellers
had
left
new
york
in
the
midst
of
a
snowstorm
but
here
the
scent
of
lilac
and
of
jonquil
the
song
of
birds
the
breath
of
spring
were
all
about
them
the
occasional
stretches
of
brick
sidewalk
under
their
green
canopy
looked
cool
and
inviting
for
while
the
chill
of
winter
had
fled
and
the
sultry
heat
of
summer
was
not
yet
at
hand
the
railroad
coach
had
been
close
and
dusty
and
the
noonday
sun
gave
some
slight
foretaste
of
his
coming
reign
the
colonel
looked
about
him
eagerly
it
was
all
so
like
and
yet
so
different
shrunken
somewhat
and
faded
but
yet
like
a
woman
one
loves
carried
into
old
age
something
of
the
charm
of
youth
the
old
town
whose
ripeness
was
almost
decay
whose
quietness
was
scarcely
distinguishable
from
lethargy
had
been
the
home
of
his
youth
and
he
saw
it
strange
to
say
less
with
the
eyes
of
the
lad
of
sixteen
who
had
gone
to
the
war
than
with
those
of
the
little
boy
to
whom
it
had
been
in
his
tenderest
years
the
great
wide
world
the
only
world
he
knew
in
the
years
when
with
his
black
boy
peter
whom
his
father
had
given
to
him
as
a
personal
attendant
he
had
gone
forth
to
field
and
garden
stream
and
forest
in
search
of
childish
adventure
yonder
was
the
old
academy
where
he
had
attended
school
the
yellow
brick
of
its
walls
had
scaled
away
in
places
leaving
the
surface
mottled
with
pale
splotches
the
shingled
roof
was
badly
dilapidated
and
overgrown
here
and
there
with
dark
green
moss
the
cedar
trees
in
the
yard
were
in
need
of
pruning
and
seemed
from
their
rusty
trunks
and
scant
leafage
to
have
shared
in
the
general
decay
as
they
drove
down
the
street
cows
were
grazing
in
the
vacant
lot
between
the
bank
which
had
been
built
by
the
colonel
grandfather
and
the
old
red
brick
building
formerly
a
store
but
now
occupied
as
could
be
seen
by
the
row
of
boxes
visible
through
the
open
door
by
the
the
little
boy
an
unusually
handsome
lad
of
five
or
six
with
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
dressed
in
knickerbockers
and
a
sailor
cap
was
also
keenly
interested
in
the
surroundings
it
was
saturday
and
the
little
carts
drawn
by
a
steer
or
a
mule
the
pigs
sleeping
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
wooden
the
lean
and
sallow
pinelanders
and
listless
negroes
dozing
on
the
curbstone
were
all
objects
of
novel
interest
to
the
boy
as
was
manifest
by
the
light
in
his
eager
eyes
and
an
occasional
exclamation
which
in
a
clear
childish
treble
came
from
his
perfectly
chiselled
lips
only
a
glance
was
needed
to
see
that
the
child
though
still
somewhat
pale
and
delicate
from
his
recent
illness
had
inherited
the
characteristics
attributed
to
good
blood
features
expression
bearing
were
marked
by
the
signs
of
race
but
a
closer
scrutiny
was
required
to
discover
in
the
lad
any
close
resemblance
to
the
shrewd
dark
man
of
affairs
who
sat
beside
him
and
to
whom
this
little
boy
was
for
the
time
being
the
sole
object
in
life
but
for
the
child
the
colonel
was
alone
in
the
world
many
years
before
when
himself
only
a
boy
he
had
served
in
the
southern
army
in
a
regiment
which
had
fought
with
such
desperate
valour
that
the
honour
of
the
colonelcy
had
come
to
him
at
nineteen
as
the
sole
survivor
of
the
group
of
young
men
who
had
officered
the
regiment
his
father
died
during
the
last
year
of
the
civil
war
having
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
conflict
work
ruin
to
his
fortunes
the
son
had
been
offered
employment
in
new
york
by
a
relative
who
had
sympathised
with
the
south
in
her
struggle
and
he
had
gone
away
from
clarendon
the
old
family
mansion
it
was
not
a
very
imposing
structure
except
by
comparison
with
even
less
pretentious
houses
had
been
sold
upon
foreclosure
and
bought
by
an
ambitious
mulatto
who
only
a
few
years
before
had
himself
been
an
object
of
barter
and
sale
entering
his
uncle
office
as
a
clerk
and
following
his
advice
reinforced
by
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
the
youthful
colonel
had
dropped
his
military
title
and
become
plain
french
putting
the
past
behind
him
except
as
a
fading
memory
he
had
thrown
himself
eagerly
into
the
current
of
affairs
fortune
favoured
one
both
capable
and
energetic
in
time
he
won
a
partnership
in
the
firm
and
when
death
removed
his
relative
took
his
place
at
its
head
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
time
not
very
far
in
the
future
when
he
might
retire
from
business
and
devote
his
leisure
to
study
and
travel
tastes
which
for
years
he
had
subordinated
to
the
pursuit
of
wealth
not
entirely
for
his
life
had
been
many
sided
and
not
so
much
for
the
money
as
because
being
in
a
game
where
dollars
were
the
counters
it
was
his
instinct
to
play
it
well
he
was
winning
already
and
when
the
bagging
trust
paid
him
for
his
share
of
the
business
a
sum
double
his
investment
he
found
himself
at
some
years
less
than
fifty
relieved
of
business
cares
and
in
command
of
an
ample
fortune
this
change
in
the
colonel
affairs
and
we
shall
henceforth
call
him
the
colonel
because
the
scene
of
this
story
is
laid
in
the
south
where
titles
are
seldom
ignored
and
where
the
colonel
could
hardly
have
escaped
his
own
even
had
he
desired
to
do
so
this
change
in
the
colonel
affairs
coincided
with
that
climacteric
of
the
mind
from
which
without
ceasing
to
look
forward
it
turns
at
times
in
wistful
retrospect
toward
the
distant
past
which
it
sees
thenceforward
through
a
mellowing
glow
of
sentiment
emancipated
from
the
counting
room
and
ordered
south
by
the
doctor
the
colonel
thoughts
turned
easily
and
naturally
to
the
old
town
that
had
given
him
birth
and
he
felt
a
twinge
of
something
like
remorse
at
the
reflection
that
never
once
since
leaving
it
had
he
set
foot
within
its
borders
for
years
he
had
been
too
busy
his
wife
had
never
manifested
any
desire
to
visit
the
south
nor
was
her
temperament
one
to
evoke
or
sympathise
with
sentimental
reminiscence
he
had
married
rather
late
in
life
a
new
york
woman
much
younger
than
himself
and
while
he
had
admired
her
beauty
and
they
had
lived
very
pleasantly
together
there
had
not
existed
between
them
the
entire
union
of
souls
essential
to
perfect
felicity
and
the
current
of
his
life
had
not
been
greatly
altered
by
her
loss
toward
little
phil
however
the
child
she
had
borne
him
his
feeling
was
very
different
his
young
wife
had
been
after
all
but
a
sweet
and
pleasant
graft
upon
a
sturdy
tree
little
phil
was
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
bone
of
his
bone
upon
his
only
child
the
colonel
lavished
all
of
his
affection
already
to
his
father
eye
the
boy
gave
promise
of
a
noble
manhood
his
frame
was
graceful
and
active
his
hair
was
even
more
brightly
golden
than
his
mother
had
been
his
eyes
more
deeply
blue
than
hers
while
his
features
were
a
duplicate
of
his
father
at
the
same
age
as
was
evidenced
by
a
faded
daguerreotype
among
the
colonel
few
souvenirs
of
his
own
childhood
little
phil
had
a
sweet
temper
a
loving
disposition
and
endeared
himself
to
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
the
hack
after
a
brief
passage
down
the
main
street
deposited
the
passengers
at
the
front
of
the
clarendon
hotel
the
colonel
paid
the
black
driver
the
quarter
he
demanded
two
dollars
would
have
been
the
new
york
price
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
in
the
heads
of
the
men
leaning
back
in
the
armchairs
under
the
shade
trees
on
the
sidewalk
registered
in
the
book
pushed
forward
by
a
clerk
with
curled
mustaches
and
pomatumed
hair
and
accompanied
by
phil
followed
the
smiling
black
bellboy
along
a
passage
and
up
one
flight
of
stairs
to
a
spacious
and
neatly
furnished
room
looking
out
upon
the
main
street
when
the
colonel
and
phil
had
removed
the
dust
and
disorder
of
travel
from
their
appearance
they
went
down
to
dinner
after
they
had
eaten
the
colonel
still
accompanied
by
the
child
left
the
hotel
and
following
the
main
street
for
a
short
distance
turned
into
another
thoroughfare
bordered
with
ancient
elms
and
stopped
for
a
moment
before
an
old
gray
house
with
high
steps
and
broad
piazza
a
large
house
with
a
roof
sloping
down
toward
the
front
broken
by
dormer
windows
and
buttressed
by
a
massive
brick
chimney
at
either
end
in
spite
of
the
gray
monotone
to
which
the
paintless
years
had
reduced
the
once
white
weatherboarding
and
green
venetian
blinds
the
house
possessed
a
certain
stateliness
of
style
which
was
independent
of
circumstance
and
a
solidity
of
construction
that
resisted
sturdily
the
disintegrating
hand
of
time
and
mused
the
colonel
like
other
things
southern
live
long
and
die
hard
the
old
house
had
been
built
of
the
best
materials
and
its
woodwork
dowelled
and
mortised
and
tongued
and
grooved
by
men
who
knew
their
trade
and
had
not
learned
to
scamp
their
work
for
the
colonel
grandfather
had
built
the
house
as
a
town
residence
the
family
having
owned
in
addition
thereto
a
handsome
country
place
upon
a
large
plantation
remote
from
the
town
the
colonel
had
stopped
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
was
looking
intently
at
the
home
of
his
ancestors
and
of
his
own
youth
when
a
neatly
dressed
coloured
girl
came
out
on
the
piazza
seated
herself
in
a
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
and
opened
what
the
colonel
perceived
to
be
even
across
the
street
a
copy
of
a
woman
magazine
whose
circulation
as
he
knew
from
the
advertising
rates
that
french
and
had
paid
for
the
use
of
its
columns
touched
the
million
mark
not
wishing
to
seem
rude
the
colonel
moved
slowly
on
down
the
street
when
he
turned
his
head
after
going
a
rod
or
two
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
the
girl
had
risen
and
was
the
house
her
disappearance
was
promptly
followed
by
the
notes
of
a
piano
slightly
out
of
tune
to
which
some
one
presumably
the
young
woman
was
singing
in
a
high
voice
which
might
have
been
better
had
it
been
better
trained
i
dreamt
that
i
in
halls
with
vassals
and
serfs
at
my
the
colonel
had
slackened
his
pace
at
the
sound
of
the
music
but
after
the
first
few
bars
started
forward
with
quickened
footsteps
which
he
did
not
relax
until
little
phil
weight
increasing
momentarily
brought
home
to
him
the
consciousness
that
his
stride
was
too
long
for
the
boy
short
legs
phil
who
was
a
thoroughbred
and
would
have
dropped
in
his
tracks
without
complaining
was
nevertheless
relieved
when
his
father
pace
returned
to
the
normal
their
walk
led
down
a
hill
and
very
soon
to
a
wooden
bridge
which
spanned
a
creek
some
twenty
feet
below
the
colonel
paused
for
a
moment
beside
the
railing
and
looked
up
and
down
the
stream
it
seemed
narrower
and
more
sluggish
than
his
memory
had
pictured
it
above
him
the
water
ran
between
high
banks
grown
thick
with
underbrush
and
trees
below
the
bridge
to
the
right
of
the
creek
lay
an
open
meadow
and
to
the
left
a
few
rods
away
the
ruins
of
the
old
eureka
cotton
mill
which
in
his
boyhood
had
harboured
a
flourishing
industry
but
which
had
remained
since
sherman
army
laid
waste
the
country
the
melancholy
ruin
the
colonel
had
seen
it
last
when
years
or
more
before
he
left
clarendon
to
seek
a
wider
career
in
the
outer
world
the
clear
water
of
the
creek
rippled
harmoniously
down
a
gentle
slope
and
over
the
site
where
the
great
dam
at
the
foot
had
stood
while
birds
were
nesting
in
the
vines
with
which
kindly
nature
had
sought
to
cloak
the
dismantled
and
crumbling
walls
mounting
the
slope
beyond
the
bridge
the
colonel
stride
now
carefully
accommodated
to
the
child
puny
step
they
skirted
a
low
brick
wall
beyond
which
white
headstones
gleamed
in
a
mass
of
verdure
reaching
an
iron
gate
the
colonel
lifted
the
latch
and
entered
the
cemetery
which
had
been
the
object
of
their
visit
is
this
the
place
papa
asked
the
little
boy
yes
phil
but
it
is
farther
on
in
the
older
part
they
passed
slowly
along
under
the
drooping
elms
and
willows
past
the
monuments
on
either
hand
here
resting
on
a
low
brick
wall
a
slab
of
marble
once
white
now
gray
and
from
which
the
hand
of
time
had
well
nigh
erased
the
carved
inscription
here
a
family
vault
built
into
the
side
of
a
mound
of
earth
from
which
only
the
barred
iron
door
distinguished
it
here
a
pedestal
with
a
angel
holding
a
broken
fragment
of
the
resurrection
trumpet
here
a
prostrate
headstone
and
there
another
bending
to
its
fall
and
among
them
a
profusion
of
rose
bushes
on
some
of
which
the
early
roses
were
already
blooming
scarcely
a
cemetery
for
in
many
lots
the
shrubbery
grew
in
wild
unpruned
luxuriance
nor
yet
entirely
neglected
since
others
showed
the
signs
of
loving
care
and
an
effort
had
been
made
to
keep
the
walks
clean
and
clear
father
and
son
had
traversed
half
the
width
of
the
cemetery
when
they
came
to
a
spacious
lot
surrounded
by
large
trees
and
containing
several
monuments
it
seemed
less
neglected
than
the
lots
about
it
and
as
they
drew
nigh
they
saw
among
the
tombs
a
very
black
and
seemingly
aged
negro
engaged
in
pruning
a
tangled
rose
tree
near
him
stood
a
dilapidated
basket
partially
filled
with
weeds
and
leaves
into
which
he
was
throwing
the
dead
and
superfluous
limbs
he
seemed
very
intent
upon
his
occupation
and
had
not
noticed
the
colonel
and
phil
approach
until
they
had
paused
at
the
side
of
the
lot
and
stood
looking
at
him
when
the
old
man
became
aware
of
their
presence
he
straightened
himself
up
with
the
slow
movement
of
one
stiff
with
age
or
rheumatism
and
threw
them
a
tentatively
friendly
look
out
of
a
pair
of
faded
eyes
howdy

the
colonel

said
the
old
man
removing
his
battered
hat
respectfully
the
rest
of
his
clothing
was
in
keeping
a
picturesque
assortment
of
rags
and
patches
such
as
only
an
old
negro
can
get
together

he

and
belongs

family
and
you
know
you
called

the
old
negro
had
dropped
his
hat
and
was
staring
at
the
colonel
and
the
little
boy
alternately
with
dawning
amazement
while
a
look
of
recognition
crept
slowly
into
his
rugged
old
face

said

why

my
young

yes
said
the
colonel
extending
his
hand
to
the
old
man
who
grasped
it
with
both
his
own
and
shook
it
up
and
down
with
unconventional
but
very
affectionate
vigour
and
you
are
my
boy
peter
who
took
care
of
me
when
i
was
no
bigger
than
phil
here
this
meeting
touched
a
tender
chord
in
the
colonel
nature
already
tuned
to
sympathy
with
the
dead
past
of
which
peter
seemed
the
only
survival
the
old
man
unfeigned
delight
at
their
meeting
his
retention
of
the
family
name
a
living
witness
of
its
former
standing
his
respect
for
the
dead
his
family
pride
which
to
the
unsympathetic
outsider
might
have
seemed
grotesque
were
proofs
of
loyalty
that
moved
the
colonel
deeply
when
he
himself
had
been
a
child
of
five
or
six
his
father
had
given
him
peter
as
his
own
boy
peter
was
really
not
many
years
older
than
the
colonel
but
prosperity
had
preserved
the
one
while
hard
luck
had
aged
the
other
prematurely
peter
had
taken
care
of
him
and
taught
him
to
paddle
in
the
shallow
water
of
the
creek
and
to
avoid
the
had
taught
him
simple
woodcraft
how
to
fish
and
how
to
hunt
first
with
bow
and
arrow
and
later
with
a
shotgun
through
the
golden
haze
of
memory
the
happy
childhood
came
back
to
him
with
a
sudden
rush
of
emotion
those
were
good
times
peter
when
we
were
young
he
sighed
regretfully
good
times
i
have
seen
none
happier

peter

rabbits

used

trap

watermillions
suh
returned
the
colonel
with
a
shade
of
pensiveness
there
had
been
two
sides
to
the
watermelon
question
peter
and
he
had
not
always
been
able
to
find
ripe
watermelons
early
in
the
season
and
at
times
there
had
been
painful
consequences
the
memory
of
which
came
back
to
the
colonel
with
surprising
ease
nor
had
they
always
been
careful
about
boundaries
in
those
early
days
there
had
been
one
occasion
when
an
irate
neighbour
had
complained
and
major
french
had
thrashed
henry
and
peter
both
peter
because
he
was
older
and
knew
better
and
henry
because
it
was
important
that
he
should
have
impressed
upon
him
early
in
life
that
of
him
to
whom
much
is
given
much
will
be
required
and
that
what
might
be
lightly
regarded
in
peter
case
would
be
a
serious
offence
in
his
future
master
the
lesson
had
been
well
learned
for
throughout
the
course
of
his
life
the
colonel
had
never
shirked
responsibility
but
had
made
the
performance
of
duty
his
criterion
of
conduct
to
him
the
line
of
least
resistance
had
always
seemed
the
refuge
of
the
coward
and
the
weakling
with
the
twenty
years
preceding
his
return
to
clarendon
this
story
has
nothing
to
do
but
upon
the
quiet
background
of
his
business
career
he
had
lived
an
active
intellectual
and
emotional
life
and
had
developed
into
one
of
those
rare
natures
of
whom
it
may
be
truly
said
that
they
are
men
and
that
they
count
nothing
of
what
is
human
foreign
to
themselves
but
the
serenity
of
peter
retrospect
was
unmarred
by
any
passing
cloud
those
who
dwell
in
darkness
find
it
easier
to
remember
the
bright
places
in
their
lives

years

colonel
had
belonged
to
a
fishing
club
which
preserved
an
stream
in
a
northern
forest
for
years
the
choicest
fruits
of
all
the
earth
had
been
served
daily
upon
his
table
yet
as
he
looked
back
no
shining
trout
that
had
ever
risen
to
his
fly
had
stirred
his
emotions
like
the
diaphanous
minnows
caught
with
a
crooked
pin
in
the
crooked
creek
no
luscious
fruit
had
ever
matched
in
sweetness

sour
grapes

peter
asked
the
colonel
peter
story
was
not
a
thrilling
one
it
was
no
tale
of
inordinate
ambition
no
odyssey
of
a
perilous
search
for
the
prizes
of
life
but
the
bald
recital
of
a
mere
struggle
for
existence
peter
had
stayed
by
his
master
until
his
master
death
then
he
had
worked
for
a
railroad
contractor
until
exposure
and
overwork
had
laid
him
up
with
a
fever
after
his
recovery
he
had
been
employed
for
some
years
at
cutting
turpentine
boxes
in
the
pine
woods
following
the
trail
of
the
industry
southward
until
one
day
his
axe
had
slipped
and
wounded
him
severely
when
his
wound
was
healed
he
was
told
that
he
was
too
old
and
awkward
for
the
turpentine
and
that
they
needed
younger
and
more
active
men
so

his
story

the
old

talk
rambled
on
like
a
sluggish
stream
while
the
colonel
more
active
mind
busied
itself
with
the
problem
suggested
by
this
unforeseen
meeting
peter
and
he
had
both
gone
out
into
the
world
and
they
had
both
returned
he
had
come
back
rich
and
independent
what
good
had
freedom
done
for
peter
in
the
childhood
his
father
butler
old
madison
had
lived
a
life
which
compared
to
that
of
peter
at
the
same
age
was
one
of
ease
and
luxury
how
easy
the
conclusion
that
the
slave
lot
had
been
the
more
fortunate
but
no
peter
had
been
better
free
there
were
plenty
of
poor
white
men
and
no
one
had
suggested
slavery
as
an
improvement
of
their
condition
had
peter
remained
a
slave
then
the
colonel
would
have
remained
a
master
which
was
only
another
form
of
slavery
the
colonel
had
been
emancipated
by
the
same
token
that
had
made
peter
free
peter
had
returned
home
poor
and
broken
not
because
he
had
been
free
but
because
nature
first
and
society
next
in
distributing
their
gifts
had
been
niggardly
with
old
peter
had
he
been
better
equipped
or
had
a
better
chance
he
might
have
made
a
better
showing
the
colonel
had
prospered
because
having
no
peters
to
work
for
him
he
had
been
compelled
to
work
for
himself
he
would
set
his
own
success
against
peter
failure
and
he
would
take
off
his
hat
to
the
memory
of
the
immortal
statesman
who
in
freeing
one
race
had
emancipated
another
and
struck
the
shackles
from
a
nation
mind
while
the
colonel
and
old
peter
were
thus
discussing
reminiscences
in
which
little
phil
could
have
no
share
the
boy
with
childish
curiosity
had
wandered
off
down
one
of
the
shaded
paths
when
a
little
later
the
colonel
looked
around
for
him
he
saw
phil
seated
on
a
rustic
bench
in
conversation
with
a
lady
as
the
boy
seemed
entirely
comfortable
and
the
lady
not
at
all
disturbed
the
colonel
did
not
interrupt
them
for
a
while
but
when
the
lady
at
length
rose
holding
phil
by
the
hand
the
colonel
fearing
that
the
boy
who
was
a
child
of
strong
impulses
prone
to
sudden
friendships
might
be
proving
troublesome
left
his
seat
on
the
tomb
of
his
revolutionary
ancestor
and
hastened
to
meet
them
i
trust
my
boy
has
annoyed
you
he
said
lifting
his
hat
not
at
all
sir
returned
the
lady
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
some
haunting
tone
of
which
found
an
answering
vibration
in
the
memory
on
the
contrary
he
has
interested
me
very
much
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
telling
me
his
name
if
this
and
my
memory
do
not
deceive
me
are
henry
french
yes
and
you
are
you
are
laura
treadwell
how
glad
i
am
to
meet
you
i
was
coming
to
call
this
afternoon
i
glad
to
see
you
again
we
have
always
remembered
you
and
knew
that
you
had
grown
rich
and
great
and
feared
that
you
had
forgotten
the
old
town
and
your
old
friends
not
very
rich
nor
very
great
laura
miss
treadwell
let
it
be
laura
she
said
with
a
faint
colour
mounting
in
her
cheek
which
had
not
yet
lost
its
smoothness
as
her
eyes
had
not
faded
nor
her
step
lost
its
spring
and
neither
have
i
forgotten
the
old
home
nor
the
old
friends
since
i
am
here
and
knew
you
the
moment
i
looked
at
you
and
heard
your
voice
and
what
a
dear
little
boy
exclaimed
miss
treadwell
looking
down
at
phil
he
is
named
philip
after
his
grandfather
i
reckon
after
his
grandfather
we
have
been
visiting
his
grave
and
those
of
all
the
frenches
and
i
found
them
haunted
by
an
old
retainer
who
had
come
hither
he
said
to
be
with
his
friends
old
peter
i
see
him
now
and
then
keeping
the
lot
in
order
there
are
few
like
him
left
and
there
were
never
any
too
many
but
how
have
you
been
these
many
years
and
where
is
your
wife
did
you
bring
her
with
you
i
buried
her
returned
the
colonel
a
little
over
a
year
ago
she
left
me
little
phil
he
must
be
like
her
replied
the
lady
and
yet
he
resembles
you
he
has
her
eyes
and
hair
said
his
father
he
is
a
good
little
boy
and
a
lad
of
taste
see
how
he
took
to
you
at
first
sight
i
can
always
trust
phil
instincts
he
is
a
born
gentleman
he
came
of
a
race
of
gentlemen
she
said
i
glad
it
is
not
to
die
out
there
are
none
too
many
left
in
clarendon
you
are
going
to
like
me
are
you
phil
asked
the
lady
i
like
you
already
replied
phil
gallantly
you
are
a
very
nice
lady
what
shall
i
call
you
call
her
miss
laura
phil
it
is
the
southern
fashion
a
happy
union
of
familiarity
and
respect
already
they
come
back
to
me
laura
one
breathes
them
with
the
air
the
gentle
southern
customs
with
all
the
faults
of
the
old
system
laura
it
carried
the
seeds
of
decay
within
itself
and
was
doomed
to
perish
a
few
of
us
at
least
had
a
good
time
an
aristocracy
is
quite
endurable
for
the
aristocrat
and
slavery
tolerable
for
the
masters
and
the
peters
when
we
were
young
before
the
rude
hand
of
war
had
shattered
our
illusions
we
were
very
happy
laura
yes
we
were
very
happy
they
were
walking
now
very
slowly
toward
the
gate
by
which
the
colonel
had
entered
with
little
phil
between
them
confiding
a
hand
to
each
and
how
is
your
mother
asked
the
colonel
she
is
living
yet
i
trust
yes
but
ailing
as
she
has
been
for
fifteen
years
ever
since
my
father
died
it
was
his
grave
i
came
to
visit
you
had
ever
a
loving
heart
laura
said
the
colonel
given
to
duty
and
are
you
still
living
in
the
old
place
the
old
place
only
it
is
older
and
shows
it
like
the
rest
of
us
she
bit
her
lip
at
the
words
which
she
meant
in
reference
to
herself
but
which
she
perceived
as
soon
as
she
had
uttered
them
might
apply
to
him
with
equal
force
despising
herself
for
the
weakness
which
he
might
have
interpreted
as
a
bid
for
a
compliment
she
was
glad
that
he
seemed
unconscious
of
the
remark
the
colonel
and
phil
had
entered
the
cemetery
by
a
side
gate
and
their
exit
led
through
the
main
entrance
miss
laura
pointed
out
as
they
walked
slowly
along
between
the
elms
the
graves
of
many
whom
the
colonel
had
known
in
his
younger
days
their
names
woven
in
the
tapestry
of
his
memory
needed
in
most
cases
but
a
touch
to
restore
them
for
while
his
intellectual
life
had
ranged
far
and
wide
his
business
career
had
run
along
a
single
channel
his
circle
of
intimates
had
not
been
very
large
nor
very
variable
nor
was
his
memory
so
overlaid
that
he
could
not
push
aside
its
later
impressions
in
favour
of
those
graven
there
so
deeply
in
his
youth
nearing
the
gate
they
passed
a
small
open
space
in
which
stood
a
simple
marble
shaft
erected
to
the
memory
of
the
confederate
dead
a
wealth
of
fresh
flowers
lay
at
its
base
the
colonel
took
off
his
hat
as
he
stood
before
it
for
a
moment
with
bowed
head
but
for
the
mercy
of
god
he
might
have
been
one
of
those
whose
deaths
as
well
as
deeds
were
thus
commemorated
beyond
this
memorial
impressive
in
its
pure
simplicity
and
between
it
and
the
gate
in
an
obtrusively
conspicuous
spot
stood
a
florid
monument
of
granite
marble
and
bronze
of
glaring
design
and
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
the
simple
dignity
and
quiet
restfulness
of
the
surroundings
a
monument
so
striking
that
the
colonel
paused
involuntarily
and
read
the
inscription
in
bronze
letters
on
the
marble
shaft
above
the
granite
base
to
the
memory
of
joshua
fetters
and
elizabeth
fetters
his
work
well
done
life
race
well
run
life
crown
well
won
then
comes
a
beautiful
sentiment
if
somewhat
trite
said
the
colonel
but
an
atrocious
monument
do
you
think
so
exclaimed
the
lady
most
people
think
the
monument
fine
but
smile
at
the
sentiment
in
matters
of
taste
returned
the
colonel
the
majority
are
always
wrong
but
why
smile
at
the
sentiment
is
it
for
some
reason
inappropriate
to
this
particular
case
fetters
fetters
the
name
seems
familiar
who
was
fetters
laura
he
was
the
speculator
she
said
who
bought
and
sold
negroes
and
kept
dogs
to
chase
runaways
old
fetters
you
must
remember
old
josh
fetters
when
i
was
a
child
my
coloured
mammy
used
him
for
a
bogeyman
for
me
as
for
her
own
children
out
honey
she
say
you
ain
good
ole
fettuhs
ketch
you
yes
he
remembered
now
fetters
had
been
a
character
in
clarendon
not
an
admirable
character
scarcely
a
good
character
almost
a
bad
character
a
necessary
adjunct
of
an
evil
system
and
like
other
parasites
worse
than
the
body
on
which
he
fed
doing
the
dirty
work
of
slavery
and
very
naturally
despised
by
those
whose
instrument
he
was
but
finding
consolation
by
taking
it
out
of
the
negroes
in
the
course
of
his
business
the
colonel
would
have
expected
fetters
to
lie
in
an
unmarked
grave
in
his
own
back
lot
or
in
the
potter
field
had
he
so
far
escaped
the
ruin
of
the
institution
on
which
he
lived
as
to
leave
an
estate
sufficient
to
satisfy
his
heirs
and
also
pay
for
this
expensive
but
vulgar
monument
the
memorial
was
erected
as
you
see
from
the
rest
of
the
inscription
his
beloved
and
affectionate
son
that
either
loved
the
other
no
one
suspected
for
bill
was
harshly
treated
and
ran
away
from
home
at
fifteen
he
came
back
after
the
war
with
money
which
he
lent
out
at
high
rates
of
interest
everything
he
touched
turned
to
gold
he
has
grown
rich
and
is
a
great
man
in
the
state
he
was
a
large
contributor
to
the
soldiers
monument
but
did
not
choose
the
design
let
us
be
thankful
for
that
it
might
have
been
like
his
father
bill
fetters
rich
and
great
he
mused
who
would
have
dreamed
it
i
kicked
him
once
all
the
way
down
main
street
from
the
schoolhouse
to
the
bank
and
dodged
his
angry
mother
for
a
whole
month
afterward
no
one
suggested
miss
laura
would
venture
to
cross
him
now
too
many
owe
him
money
he
went
to
school
at
the
academy
the
colonel
went
on
unwinding
the
thread
of
his
memory
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
looked
down
on
him
and
made
his
life
miserable
well
laura
in
fetters
you
see
one
thing
that
resulted
from
the
war
the
poor
white
boy
was
given
a
chance
to
grow
and
if
the
product
is
not
as
yet
altogether
admirable
taste
and
culture
may
come
with
another
generation
it
is
to
be
hoped
they
may
said
miss
laura
and
character
as
well
fetters
has
a
son
who
has
gone
from
college
to
college
and
will
graduate
from
harvard
this
summer
they
say
he
is
very
wild
and
spends
ten
thousand
dollars
a
year
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
possible
the
colonel
smiled
at
her
simplicity
i
have
been
he
said
at
a
college
football
game
where
the
gate
receipts
were
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
half
a
million
was
said
to
have
changed
hands
in
bets
on
the
result
it
is
easy
to
waste
money
it
is
a
sin
she
said
that
some
should
be
made
poor
that
others
may
have
it
to
waste
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
her
tone
the
instinctive
resentment
the
colonel
thought
of
the
born
aristocrat
toward
the
upstart
who
had
pushed
his
way
above
those
no
longer
strong
enough
to
resist
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
her
feeling
might
rest
upon
any
personal
ground
it
was
inevitable
that
with
the
incubus
of
slavery
removed
society
should
readjust
itself
in
due
time
upon
a
democratic
basis
and
that
poor
white
men
first
and
black
men
next
should
reach
a
level
representing
the
true
measure
of
their
talents
and
their
ambition
but
it
was
perhaps
equally
inevitable
that
for
a
generation
or
two
those
who
had
suffered
most
from
the
readjustment
should
chafe
under
its
seeming
injustice
the
colonel
was
himself
a
gentleman
and
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
gentlemen
but
he
had
lived
too
many
years
among
those
who
judged
the
tree
by
its
fruit
to
think
that
blood
alone
entitled
him
to
any
special
privileges
the
consciousness
of
honourable
ancestry
might
make
one
clean
of
life
gentle
of
manner
and
just
in
one
dealings
in
so
far
as
it
did
this
it
was
something
to
be
cherished
but
scarcely
to
be
boasted
of
for
democracy
is
impatient
of
any
excellence
not
born
of
personal
effort
of
any
pride
save
that
of
achievement
he
was
glad
that
fetters
had
got
on
in
the
world
it
justified
a
fine
faith
in
humanity
that
wealth
and
power
should
have
been
attained
by
the
poor
white
lad
over
whom
with
a
unconscious
brutality
he
had
tyrannised
in
his
childhood
he
could
have
wished
for
bill
a
better
taste
in
monuments
and
better
luck
in
sons
if
rumour
was
correct
about
fetters
boy
but
these
perhaps
were
points
where
blood
tell
there
was
something
in
blood
after
all
nature
might
make
a
great
man
from
any
sort
of
material
hence
the
virtue
of
democracy
for
the
world
needs
great
men
and
suffers
from
their
lack
and
welcomes
them
from
any
source
but
fine
types
were
a
matter
of
breeding
and
were
perhaps
worth
the
trouble
of
preserving
if
their
existence
were
compatible
with
the
larger
good
he
wondered
if
bill
ever
recalled
that
progress
down
main
street
in
which
he
had
played
so
conspicuous
a
part
or
still
bore
any
resentment
toward
the
other
participants
could
your
mother
see
me
he
asked
as
they
reached
the
gate
if
i
went
by
the
house
she
would
be
glad
to
see
you
mother
lives
in
the
past
and
you
would
come
to
her
as
part
of
it
she
often
speaks
of
you
it
is
only
a
short
distance
you
have
not
forgotten
the
way
they
turned
to
the
right
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
from
which
the
colonel
had
reached
the
cemetery
after
a
few
minutes
walk
in
the
course
of
which
they
crossed
another
bridge
over
the
same
winding
creek
they
mounted
the
slope
beyond
opened
a
gate
climbed
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
and
found
themselves
in
an
enchanted
garden
where
lilac
bush
and
jessamine
vine
reared
their
heads
high
tulip
and
daffodil
pushed
their
way
upward
but
were
all
dominated
by
the
intenser
fragrance
of
the
violets
old
peter
had
followed
the
party
at
a
respectful
distance
but
seeing
himself
forgotten
he
walked
past
the
gate
after
they
had
entered
it
and
went
somewhat
disconsolately
on
his
way
he
had
stopped
and
was
looking
back
toward
the
house
clarendon
was
a
great
place
for
looking
back
perhaps
because
there
was
little
in
the
town
to
which
to
look
forward
when
a
white
man
wearing
a
tinned
badge
upon
his
coat
came
up
took
peter
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
despite
some
feeble
protests
on
the
old
man
part
at
the
end
of
the
garden
stood
a
frame
house
with
a
wide
columned
porch
it
had
once
been
white
and
the
windows
closed
with
blinds
that
still
retained
a
faded
tint
of
green
upon
the
porch
in
a
comfortable
arm
chair
sat
an
old
lady
wearing
a
white
cap
under
which
her
white
hair
showed
at
the
sides
and
holding
her
hands
upon
which
she
wore
black
silk
mits
crossed
upon
her
lap
on
the
top
step
at
opposite
ends
sat
two
young
people
one
of
them
a
girl
in
the
bloom
of
early
youth
with
a
head
of
rebellious
brown
hair
she
had
been
reading
a
book
held
open
in
her
hand
the
other
was
a
lean
shy
young
man
of
apparently
or
with
black
hair
and
eyes
and
a
swarthy
complexion
from
the
beside
him
and
the
shavings
scattered
around
it
was
clear
that
he
had
been
whittling
out
the
piece
of
pine
that
he
was
adjusting
with
some
nicety
to
a
wooden
model
of
some
mechanical
contrivance
which
stood
upon
the
floor
beside
him
they
were
a
strikingly
handsome
couple
of
ideally
contrasting
types

replied
the
colonel
and
this
said
miss
treadwell
introducing
the
young
man
who
when
he
unfolded
his
long
legs
rose
to
a
rather
imposing
height

son
of

henry
said
treadwell

have
never
been
the
same
since
the
surrender

poor
most
of
them
though
we

fortunate
enough
to
have
something
left

have
enough
left
for
supper
mother
interposed
miss
laura
quickly
to
which
we
are
going
to
ask
colonel
french

suppose
that
in
new
york
every
one
has
dinner
at
six
and
supper
after
the
theatre
or
the
concert
said
graciella
inquiringly
the
fortunate
few
returned
the
colonel
smiling
into
her
eager
face
who
can
afford
a
seat
at
the
opera
and
to
pay
for
and
digest
two
meals
all
in
the
same
evening
and
now
colonel
said
miss
treadwell
i
going
to
see

a
prescription
on
my
way

he
added
addressing
the
colonel

decided

day
or

perhaps
a
week

by
any
business

as
we
used
to
say
when
i
was
young

inclinations

i
hope
sir
that
you

inclined
to
pay
us
a
long
visit
and
that
i
shall
see
you
many
times
as
ben
dudley
after
this
courteous
wish
stepped
down
from
the
piazza
graciella
rose
and
walked
with
him
along
the
garden
path
she
was
tall
as
most
women
but
only
reached
his
shoulder
say
graciella
he
asked
wo
you
give
me
an
answer
i
thinking
about
it
ben
if
you
could
take
me
away
from
this
dead
old
town
with
its
lazy
white
people
and
its
trifling
niggers
to
a
place
where
there
music
and
art
and
life
and
society
where
something
going
on
all
the
time
i
to
marry
you
but
if
i
did
so
now
you
take
me
out
to
your
rickety
old
house
with
your
daffy
old
uncle
and
his
dumb
old
housekeeper
and
i
should
lose
my
own
mind
in
a
week
or
ten
days
when
you
can
promise
to
take
me
to
new
york
i
promise
to
marry
you
ben
i
want
to
travel
and
to
see
things
to
visit
the
art
galleries
and
libraries
to
hear
patti
and
to
look
at
the
millionaires
promenading
on
fifth
avenue
and
i
marry
the
man
who
take
me
there
uncle
malcolm
ca
live
forever
graciella
though
i
would
wish
his
span
shortened
by
a
single
day
and
i
get
the
plantation
and
then
you
know
he
added
hesitating
we
may
we
may
find
the
money
graciella
shook
her
head
compassionately
no
ben
you
never
find
the
money
there
is
any
it
all
imagination
moonshine
the
war
unsettled
your
uncle
brain
and
he
dreamed
the
money
it
as
true
as
i
standing
here
graciella
replied
ben
earnestly
that
there
money
gold
somewhere
about
the
house
uncle
could
imagine
paper
and
ink
and
i
seen
the
letter
from
my
uncle
uncle
ralph
i
get
it
and
bring
it
to
you
some
day
the
money
will
turn
up
and
then
may
be
i
be
able
to
take
you
away
meantime
some
one
must
look
after
uncle
and
the
place
there
no
one
else
but
me
to
do
it
things
must
grow
better
some
time
they
always
do
you
know
they
could
be
much
worse
returned
graciella
discontentedly
oh
they
be
better
they
bound
to
be
they
just
have
to
be
and
you
wait
for
me
wo
you
graciella
oh
i
suppose
i
have
to
you
around
here
so
much
that
every
one
else
is
scared
away
and
there
is
much
choice
at
the
best
all
the
young
men
worth
having
are
gone
away
already
but
you
know
my
ultimatum
i
must
get
to
new
york
if
you
are
ready
before
any
one
else
speaks
you
may
take
me
there
you
hard
on
a
poor
devil
graciella
i
do
believe
you
care
a
bit
for
me
or
you
would
talk
like
that
do
you
suppose
i
have
any
feelings
even
if
i
ai
much
account
ai
i
worth
as
much
as
a
trip
up
north
why
should
i
waste
my
time
with
you
if
i
did
care
for
you
returned
graciella
begging
the
question
here
a
rose
in
token
of
my
love
she
plucked
the
flower
and
thrust
it
into
his
hand
it
full
of
thorns
like
your
love
he
said
ruefully
as
he
picked
the
sharp
points
out
of
his
fingers
are
the
wounds
of
a
friend
returned
the
girl
see
psalms
xxvii
take
care
of
my
cotton
press
graciella
i
come
in
evening
and
work
on
it
some
more
i
bring
some
cotton
along
to
try
it
with
you
probably
find
some
excuse
you
always
do
do
you
want
me
to
come
he
asked
with
a
trace
of
resentment
i
can
stay
away
if
you
do
oh
you
come
so
often
that
i
i
suppose
i
miss
you
if
you
did
one
must
have
some
company
and
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
he
went
on
down
the
hill
turning
at
the
corner
for
a
lingering
backward
look
at
his
tyrant
graciella
bending
her
head
over
the
wall
followed
his
movements
with
a
swift
tenderness
in
her
sparkling
brown
eyes
i
love
him
better
than
anything
on
earth
she
sighed
but
it
would
never
do
to
tell
him
so
he
get
so
conceited
that
i
could
manage
him
any
longer
and
so
lazy
that
he
never
exert
himself
i
must
get
away
from
this
town
before
i
old
and
gray
i
be
seventeen
next
week
and
an
old
maid
in
next
to
no
time
and
ben
must
take
me
away
but
i
must
be
his
inspiration
he
never
do
it
by
himself
i
go
now
and
talk
to
that
dear
old
colonel
french
about
the
north
i
can
learn
a
great
deal
from
him
and
he
does
look
so
old
either
she
mused
as
she
went
back
up
the
walk
to
where
the
colonel
sat
on
the
piazza
talking
to
the
other
ladies
the
colonel
spent
a
delightful
evening
in
the
company
of
his
friends
the
supper
was
typically
southern
and
the
cook
evidently
a
good
one
there
was
smothered
chicken
light
biscuit
fresh
eggs
poundcake
and
tea
the
tablecloth
and
napkins
were
of
fine
linen
that
they
were
soft
and
smooth
the
colonel
noticed
but
he
did
not
observe
closely
enough
to
see
that
they
had
been
carefully
darned
in
many
places
the
silver
spoons
were
of
fine
patterns
worn
very
thin
so
thin
that
even
the
colonel
was
struck
by
their
fragility
how
charming
he
thought
to
prefer
the
simple
dignity
of
the
past
to
the
vulgar
ostentation
of
a
more
modern
time
he
had
once
dined
off
a
golden
dinner
service
at
the
table
of
a
and
had
not
enjoyed
the
meal
half
so
much
the
looked
out
upon
the
garden
and
the
perfume
of
lilac
and
violet
stole
in
through
the
open
windows
a
shapely
negro
maid
in
white
cap
and
apron
waited
deftly
upon
the
table
a
woman
of
serious
countenance
so
serious
that
the
colonel
wondered
if
she
were
a
type
of
her
race
and
if
the
responsibilities
of
freedom
had
robbed
her
people
of
their
traditional
and
gaiety
after
supper
they
sat
out
upon
the
piazza
the
lights
within
were
turned
down
low
so
that
the
moths
and
other
insects
might
not
be
attracted
sweet
odours
from
the
garden
filled
the
air
through
the
elms
the
stars
brighter
than
in
more
northern
latitudes
looked
out
from
a
sky
of
darker
blue
so
bright
were
they
that
the
colonel
looking
around
for
the
moon
was
surprised
to
find
that
luminary
invisible
on
the
green
background
of
the
foliage
the
fireflies
glowed
and
flickered
there
was
no
strident
steam
whistle
from
factory
or
train
to
assault
the
ear
no
rumble
of
passing
cabs
or
street
cars
far
away
in
some
distant
part
of
the
straggling
town
a
bell
sounded
the
hour
of
an
evening
church
service
to
see
you
is
a
breath
from
the
past
henry
said
treadwell
you
are
a
fine
strong
man
now
but
i
can
see
you
as
you
were
the
day
you
went
away
to
the
war
in
your
new
gray
uniform
on
your
fine
gray
horse
at
the
head
of
your
company
you
were
going
to
take
peter
with
you
but
he
had
got
his
feet
poisoned
with
poison
ivy
and
could
walk
and
your
father
gave
you
another
boy
and
peter
cried
like
a
baby
at
being
left
behind
i
can
remember
how
proud
you
were
and
how
proud
your
father
was
when
he
gave
you
his
sword
your
grandfather
sword
and
told
you
never
to
draw
it
or
sheath
it
except
in
honour
and
how
when
you
were
gone
the
old
gentleman
shut
himself
up
for
two
whole
days
and
would
speak
to
no
one
he
was
glad
and
sorry
glad
to
send
you
to
fight
for
your
country
and
sorry
to
see
you
go
for
you
were
his
only
boy
the
colonel
thrilled
with
love
and
regret
his
father
had
loved
him
he
knew
very
well
and
he
had
not
visited
his
tomb
for
years
how
far
away
it
seemed
too
the
time
when
he
had
thought
of
the
confederacy
as
his
country
and
the
sword
his
sword
had
been
for
years
stored
away
in
a
dark
closet
his
father
had
kept
it
displayed
upon
the
wall
over
the
table
on
which
the
family
bible
had
rested
treadwell
was
silent
for
a
moment
times
have
changed
since
then
henry
we
have
lost
a
great
deal
although
we
still
have
enough
yes
we
have
plenty
to
live
upon
and
to
hold
up
our
heads
among
the
best
miss
laura
and
graciella
behind
the
colonel
back
exchanged
meaning
glances
how
well
they
knew
how
little
they
had
to
live
upon
that
is
quite
evident
said
the
colonel
glancing
through
the
window
at
the
tasteful
interior
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
have
fared
so
well
my
father
lost
everything
we
were
more
fortunate
said
treadwell
we
were
obliged
to
let
belleview
go
when
major
treadwell
died
there
were
debts
to
be
paid
and
we
were
robbed
as
well
but
we
have
several
rentable
properties
in
town
and
an
estate
in
the
country
which
brings
us
in
an
income
but
things
are
not
quite
what
they
used
to
be
treadwell
sighed
and
nodded
miss
laura
sat
in
silence
a
pensive
silence
she
too
remembered
the
time
gone
by
but
unlike
her
mother
life
her
own
had
only
begun
as
the
good
times
were
ending
her
mother
in
her
youth
had
seen
something
of
the
world
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
planter
she
had
spent
her
summers
at
saratoga
had
visited
new
york
and
philadelphia
and
new
orleans
and
had
taken
a
voyage
to
europe
graciella
was
young
and
beautiful
her
prince
might
come
might
be
here
even
now
if
this
grand
gentleman
should
chance
to
throw
the
handkerchief
but
she
laura
had
passed
her
youth
in
a
transition
period
the
pleasures
neither
of
memory
nor
of
hope
had
been
hers
except
such
memories
as
came
of
duty
well
performed
and
such
hopes
as
had
no
root
in
anything
earthly
or
corruptible
graciella
was
not
in
a
reflective
mood
and
took
up
the
burden
of
the
conversation
where
her
grandmother
had
dropped
it
her
thoughts
were
not
of
the
past
but
of
the
future
she
asked
many
eager
questions
of
new
york
was
it
true
that
ladies
at
the
always
went
to
dinner
in
bodices
with
short
sleeves
and
was
evening
dress
always
required
at
the
theatre
did
the
old
knickerbocker
families
recognise
the
vanderbilts
were
the
rockefellers
anything
at
all
socially
did
he
know
ward
mcallister
at
that
period
the
beau
brummel
of
the
metropolitan
smart
set
was
fifth
avenue
losing
its
on
what
days
of
the
week
was
the
art
museum
free
to
the
public
what
was
the
fare
to
new
york
and
the
best
quarter
of
the
city
in
which
to
inquire
for
a
quiet
select
boarding
house
where
a
southern
lady
of
refinement
and
good
family
might
stay
at
a
reasonable
price
and
meet
some
nice
people
and
would
he
recommend
stenography
or
magazine
work
and
which
did
he
consider
preferable
as
a
career
which
such
a
young
lady
might
follow
without
injury
to
her
social
standing
the
colonel
with
some
amusement
answered
these
artless
inquiries
as
best
he
could
they
came
as
a
refreshing
foil
to
the
sweet
but
melancholy
memories
of
the
past
they
were
interesting
too
from
this
very
pretty
but
very
ignorant
little
girl
in
this
backward
little
southern
town
she
was
a
flash
of
sunlight
through
a
soft
gray
cloud
a
vigorous
shoot
from
an
old
stump
she
was
life
young
life
the
vital
principle
breaking
through
the
cumbering
envelope
and
asserting
its
right
to
reach
the
sun
after
a
while
a
couple
of
very
young
ladies
friends
of
graciella
dropped
in
they
were
introduced
to
the
colonel
who
found
that
he
had
known
their
fathers
or
their
mothers
or
their
grandfathers
or
their
grandmothers
and
that
many
of
them
were
more
or
less
distantly
related
a
little
later
a
couple
of
young
men
friends
of
friends
also
very
young
and
very
made
their
appearance
and
were
duly
introduced
in
person
and
by
pedigree
the
conversation
languished
for
a
moment
and
then
one
of
the
young
ladies
said
something
about
music
and
one
of
the
young
men
remarked
that
he
had
brought
over
a
new
song
graciella
begged
the
colonel
to
excuse
them
and
led
the
way
to
the
parlour
followed
by
her
young
friends
treadwell
had
fallen
asleep
and
was
leaning
comfortably
back
in
her
armchair
miss
laura
excused
herself
brought
a
veil
and
laid
it
softly
across
her
mother
face
the
night
air
is
not
damp
she
said
and
it
is
pleasanter
for
her
here
than
in
the
house
she
wo
mind
the
music
she
is
accustomed
to
it
graciella
went
to
the
piano
and
with
great
boldness
of
touch
struck
the
bizarre
opening
chords
and
then
launched
into
the
grotesque
words
of
the
latest
new
york
coon
song
one
of
the
first
and
worst
of
its
kind
and
the
other
young
people
joined
in
the
chorus
it
was
the
first
discordant
note
at
home
the
colonel
subscribed
to
the
opera
and
enjoyed
the
music
a
plantation
song
of
the
olden
time
as
he
remembered
it
borne
upon
the
evening
air
when
sung
by
the
tired
slaves
at
the
end
of
their
day
of
toil
would
have
been
pleasing
with
its
simple
melody
its
plaintive
minor
strains
its
notes
of
vague
longing
but
to
the
colonel
senses
there
was
no
music
in
this
hackneyed
popular
favourite
in
a
metropolitan
music
hall
gaudily
bedecked
and
brilliantly
lighted
it
would
have
been
tolerable
from
the
lips
of
a
comedian
but
in
this
quiet
place
upon
this
quiet
night
and
in
the
colonel
mood
it
seemed
like
profanation
the
song
of
the
coloured
girl
who
had
dreamt
that
she
dwelt
in
marble
halls
and
the
rest
had
been
less
incongruous
it
had
at
least
breathed
aspiration
treadwell
was
still
dozing
in
her
armchair
the
colonel
beckoning
miss
laura
to
follow
him
moved
to
the
farther
end
of
the
piazza
where
they
might
not
hear
the
singers
and
the
song
it
is
delightful
here
laura
i
seem
to
have
renewed
my
youth
i
yield
myself
a
willing
victim
to
the
charm
of
the
old
place
the
old
ways
the
old
friends
you
see
our
best
side
henry
night
has
a
kindly
hand
that
covers
our
defects
and
the
starlight
throws
a
glamour
over
everything
you
see
us
through
a
haze
of
tender
memories
when
you
have
been
here
a
week
the
town
will
seem
dull
and
narrow
and
sluggish
you
will
find
us
ignorant
and
backward
worshipping
our
old
idols
and
setting
up
no
new
ones
our
young
men
leaving
us
and
none
coming
in
to
take
their
place
had
you
and
men
like
you
remained
with
us
we
might
have
hoped
for
better
things
and
perhaps
not
laura
environment
controls
the
making
of
men
some
rise
above
it
the
majority
do
not
we
might
have
followed
in
the
rut
but
let
us
not
spoil
this
delightful
evening
by
speaking
of
anything
sad
or
gloomy
this
is
your
daily
life
to
me
it
is
like
a
scene
from
a
play
over
which
one
sighs
to
see
the
curtain
fall
all
enchantment
all
light
all
happiness
but
even
while
he
spoke
of
light
a
shadow
loomed
up
beside
them
the
coloured
woman
who
had
waited
at
the
table
came
around
the
house
from
the
back
yard
and
stood
by
the
piazza
railing
miss
laura
she
called
softly
and
appealingly
kin
you
come
hyuh
a
minute
what
is
it
catherine
kin
i
speak
just
a
word
to
you
it
mighty
excuse
me
a
minute
henry
said
miss
laura
rising
with
evident
reluctance
she
stepped
down
from
the
piazza
and
walked
beside
the
woman
down
one
of
the
garden
paths
the
colonel
as
he
sat
there
smoking
with
miss
laura
permission
he
had
lighted
a
cigar
could
see
the
light
stuff
of
the
lady
gown
against
the
green
background
though
she
was
walking
in
the
shadow
of
the
elms
from
the
murmur
which
came
to
him
he
gathered
that
the
black
woman
was
pleading
earnestly
passionately
and
he
could
hear
miss
laura
regretful
voice
as
she
closed
the
interview
i
am
sorry
catherine
but
it
is
simply
impossible
i
would
if
i
could
but
i
can
not
the
woman
came
back
first
and
as
she
passed
by
an
open
window
the
light
fell
upon
her
face
which
showed
signs
of
deep
distress
hardening
already
into
resignation
or
despair
she
was
probably
in
trouble
of
some
sort
and
her
mistress
had
not
been
able
doubtless
for
some
good
reason
to
help
her
out
this
suspicion
was
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
when
miss
laura
came
back
to
him
she
too
seemed
troubled
but
since
she
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
the
colonel
gave
no
sign
of
his
own
thoughts
you
have
said
nothing
of
yourself
laura
he
said
wishing
to
divert
her
mind
from
anything
unpleasant
tell
me
something
of
your
own
life
it
could
only
be
a
cheerful
theme
for
you
have
means
and
leisure
and
a
perfect
environment
tell
me
of
your
occupations
your
hopes
your
aspirations
there
is
little
enough
to
tell
henry
she
returned
with
a
sudden
courage
but
that
little
shall
be
the
truth
you
will
find
it
out
if
you
stay
long
in
town
and
i
would
rather
you
learned
it
from
our
lips
than
from
others
less
friendly
my
mother
is
my
mother
a
dear
sweet
woman
to
whom
i
have
devoted
my
life
but
we
are
not
well
off
henry
our
parlour
carpet
has
been
down
for
years
surely
you
must
have
recognised
the
pattern
the
house
has
not
been
painted
for
the
same
length
of
time
it
is
of
heart
pine
and
we
train
the
flowers
and
vines
to
cover
it
as
much
as
may
be
and
there
are
many
others
like
it
so
it
is
not
conspicuous
our
rentable
property
is
three
ramshackle
cabins
on
the
alley
at
the
rear
of
the
lot
for
which
we
get
four
dollars
a
month
each
when
we
can
collect
it
our
country
estate
is
a
few
acres
of
poor
land
which
we
rent
on
shares
and
from
which
we
get
a
few
bushels
of
corn
an
occasional
load
of
firewood
and
a
few
barrels
of
potatoes
as
for
my
own
life
i
husband
our
small
resources
i
keep
the
house
and
wait
on
mother
as
i
have
done
since
she
became
helpless
ten
years
ago
i
look
after
graciella
i
teach
in
the
sunday
school
and
i
give
to
those
less
fortunate
such
help
as
the
poor
can
give
the
poor
how
did
you
come
to
lose
belleview
asked
the
colonel
after
a
pause
i
had
understood
major
treadwell
to
be
one
of
the
few
people
around
here
who
weathered
the
storm
of
war
and
emerged
financially
sound
he
did
and
he
remained
so
until
he
met
fetters
who
had
made
money
out
of
the
war
while
all
the
rest
were
losing
father
despised
the
slavetrader
son
but
admired
his
ability
to
get
along
fetters
made
his
acquaintance
flattered
him
told
him
glowing
stories
of
wealth
to
be
made
by
speculating
in
cotton
and
turpentine
father
was
not
a
business
man
but
he
listened
fetters
lent
him
money
and
father
lent
fetters
money
and
they
had
transactions
back
and
forth
and
jointly
father
lost
and
gained
and
we
had
no
inkling
that
he
had
suffered
greatly
until
at
his
sudden
death
fetters
foreclosed
a
mortgage
he
held
upon
belleview
mother
has
always
believed
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
transaction
and
that
father
was
not
indebted
to
fetters
in
any
such
sum
as
fetters
claimed
but
we
could
find
no
papers
and
we
had
no
proof
and
fetters
took
the
plantation
for
his
debt
he
changed
its
name
to
sycamore
he
wanted
a
there
and
there
were
too
many
belleviews
does
he
own
it
still
yes
and
runs
it
with
convict
labour
the
thought
makes
me
shudder
we
were
rich
when
he
was
poor
we
are
poor
and
he
is
rich
but
we
trust
in
god
who
has
never
deserted
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
by
his
mercy
we
have
lived
and
as
mother
says
held
up
our
heads
not
in
pride
or
haughtiness
but
in
for
we
can
not
forget
what
we
were
nor
what
you
are
laura
for
you
are
wonderful
said
the
colonel
not
unwilling
to
lighten
a
situation
that
bordered
on
intensity
you
should
have
married
and
had
children
the
south
needs
such
mothers
as
you
would
have
made
unless
the
men
of
clarendon
have
lost
their
discernment
unless
chivalry
has
vanished
and
the
fire
died
out
of
the
southern
blood
it
has
not
been
for
lack
of
opportunity
that
your
name
remains
unchanged
miss
laura
cheek
flushed
unseen
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
ah
henry
that
would
be
telling
but
to
marry
me
one
must
have
married
the
family
for
i
could
not
have
left
them
they
have
had
only
me
i
have
not
been
unhappy
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
have
had
my
life
different
graciella
and
her
friends
had
finished
their
song
the
piano
had
ceased
to
sound
and
the
visitors
were
taking
their
leave
graciella
went
with
them
to
the
gate
where
they
stood
laughing
and
talking
the
colonel
looked
at
his
watch
by
the
light
of
the
open
door
it
is
not
late
he
said
if
my
memory
is
true
you
too
played
the
piano
when
you
when
i
was
young
it
is
the
same
piano
henry
and
like
our
life
here
somewhat
thin
and
weak
of
tone
but
if
you
think
it
would
give
you
pleasure
i
will
play
as
well
as
i
know
how
she
readjusted
the
veil
which
had
slipped
from
her
mother
face
and
they
went
into
the
parlour
from
a
pile
of
music
she
selected
a
sheet
and
seated
herself
at
the
piano
the
colonel
stood
at
her
elbow
she
had
a
pretty
back
he
thought
and
a
still
youthful
turn
of
the
head
and
still
plentiful
glossy
brown
hair
her
hands
were
white
slender
and
well
kept
though
he
saw
on
the
side
of
the
forefinger
of
her
left
hand
the
telltale
marks
of
the
needle
the
piece
was
an
arrangement
of
the
air
from
the
opera
of
scenes
that
are
brightest
may
charm
awhile
hearts
which
are
lightest
and
eyes
that
smile
yet
them
above
us
though
nature
beam
with
none
to
love
us
how
sad
they
seem
under
her
sympathetic
touch
a
gentle
stream
of
melody
flowed
from
the
piano
scarcely
stronger
toned
in
its
decrepitude
than
the
spinet
of
a
former
century
a
few
moments
before
under
vigorous
hands
it
had
seemed
to
protest
at
the
dissonances
it
had
been
compelled
to
emit
now
it
seemed
to
breathe
the
notes
of
the
old
opera
with
an
almost
human
love
and
tenderness
it
too
mused
the
colonel
had
lived
and
loved
and
was
recalling
the
memories
of
a
brighter
past
the
music
died
into
silence
treadwell
was
awake
laura
she
called
miss
treadwell
went
to
the
door
i
must
have
been
nodding
for
a
minute
i
hope
colonel
french
did
not
observe
it
it
would
scarcely
seem
polite
he
has
gone
yet
no
mother
he
is
in
the
parlour
i
must
be
going
said
the
colonel
who
came
to
the
door
i
had
almost
forgotten
phil
and
it
is
long
past
his
bedtime
miss
laura
went
to
wake
up
phil
who
had
fallen
asleep
after
supper
he
was
still
rubbing
his
eyes
when
the
lady
led
him
out
wake
up
phil
said
the
colonel
it
time
to
be
going
tell
the
ladies
good
night
graciella
came
running
up
the
walk
why
colonel
french
she
cried
you
are
not
going
already
i
made
the
others
leave
early
so
that
i
might
talk
to
you
my
dear
young
lady
smiled
the
colonel
i
have
already
risen
to
go
and
if
i
stayed
longer
i
might
wear
out
my
welcome
and
phil
would
surely
go
to
sleep
again
but
i
will
come
another
time
i
shall
stay
in
town
several
days
yes
come
if
you
go
rejoined
graciella
with
emphasis
i
want
to
hear
more
about
the
north
and
about
new
york
society
and
oh
everything
good
night
philip
night
colonel
french
beware
of
the
steps
henry
said
miss
laura
the
bottom
stone
is
loose
they
heard
his
footsteps
in
the
quiet
street
and
phil
light
patter
beside
him
he
a
lovely
man
is
he
aunt
laura
said
graciella
he
is
a
gentleman
replied
her
aunt
with
a
pensive
look
at
her
young
niece
of
the
old
school
piped
treadwell
and
philip
is
a
sweet
child
said
miss
laura
a
chip
of
the
old
block
added
treadwell
i
remember
yes
mother
you
can
tell
me
when
i
shut
up
the
house
interrupted
miss
laura
put
out
the
lamps
graciella
there
not
much
oil
and
when
you
go
to
bed
hang
up
your
gown
carefully
for
it
takes
me
nearly
half
an
hour
to
iron
it
and
you
are
right
good
to
do
it
good
night
dear
aunt
laura
good
night
grandma
french
had
left
the
hotel
at
noon
that
day
as
free
as
air
and
he
slept
well
that
night
with
no
sense
of
the
forces
that
were
to
constrain
his
life
and
yet
the
events
of
the
day
had
started
the
growth
of
a
dozen
tendrils
which
were
destined
to
grow
and
reach
out
and
seize
and
hold
him
with
ties
that
do
not
break
the
constable
who
had
arrested
old
peter
led
his
prisoner
away
through
alleys
and
quiet
streets
though
for
that
matter
all
the
streets
of
clarendon
were
quiet
in
midafternoon
to
a
guardhouse
or
calaboose
constructed
of
crumbling
red
brick
with
a
rusty
barred
iron
door
secured
by
a
heavy
padlock
as
they
approached
this
structure
which
was
sufficiently
forbidding
in
appearance
to
depress
the
most
lighthearted
the
strumming
of
a
banjo
became
audible
accompanying
a
mellow
negro
voice
which
was
singing
to
a
very
ragged
ragtime
air
words
of
which
the
burden
was
something
like
this
de
use
er
my
so
hahd

white
man
yahd

a
wing
dey
i
i
ain
doin
a
thing
the
grating
of
the
key
in
the
rusty
lock
interrupted
the
song
the
constable
thrust
his
prisoner
into
the
dimly
lighted
interior
and
locked
the
door
keep
over
to
the
right
he
said
curtly
that

old
peter
still
protested

said
the
constable
who
was
not
without
a
certain
grim
sense
of
humour
and
not
above
talking
to
a
negro
when
there
were
no
white
folks
around

i

the
beat
of
it
in
all
my
days
when
the
constable
chuckling
at
his
own
humour
left
the
guardhouse
he
found
his
way
to
a
nearby
barroom
kept
by
one
clay
jackson
a
place
with
an
evil
reputation
as
the
resort
of
white
men
of
a
low
class
most
crimes
of
violence
in
the
town
could
be
traced
to
its
influence
and
more
than
one
had
been
committed
within
its
walls

turner

in

demanded
haines
of
the
man
in
charge
the
bartender
with
a
backward
movement
of
his
thumb
indicated
a
door
opening
into
a
room
at
the
rear
here
the
constable
found
his
man
a
burly
bearded
giant
with
a
red
face
a
cunning
eye
and
an
overbearing
manner
he
had
a
bottle
and
a
glass
before
him
and
was
unsociably
drinking
alone

and
i
be
on
hand
in
the
mornin
when
court
opens
when
the
lesser
of
these
precious
worthies
left
his
superior
to
his
cups
he
stopped
in
the
barroom
and
bought
a
pint
of
rotgut
whiskey
a
cheap
brand
of
rectified
spirits
coloured
and
flavoured
to
resemble
the
real
article
to
which
it
bore
about
the
relation
of
vitriol
to
lye
he
then
went
into
a
cheap
eating
house
conducted
by
a
negro
for
people
of
his
own
kind
where
he
procured
some
slices
of
fried
bacon
and
some
soggy
corn
bread
and
with
these
various
purchases
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
brown
paper
he
betook
himself
to
the
guardhouse
he
unlocked
the
door
closed
it
behind
him
and
called
peter
the
old
man
came
forward
here
peter
said
haines
take
what
you
want
of
this
and
give
some
to
them
other
fellows
and
if
there
anything
left
after
you
got
what
you
want
throw
it
to
that
sulky
black
hound
over
yonder
in
the
corner
he
nodded
toward
a
young
negro
in
the
rear
of
the
room
the
bud
johnson
who
had
been
the
subject
of
the
conversation
with
turner
johnson
replied
with
a
curse
the
constable
advanced
menacingly
his
hand
moving
toward
his
pocket
quick
as
a
flash
the
negro
threw
himself
upon
him
the
other
prisoners
from
instinct
or
prudence
or
hope
of
reward
caught
him
pulled
him
away
and
held
him
off
until
haines
pale
with
rage
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
kicking
his
assailant
vigorously
with
the
aid
of
blows
of
his
fists
he
forced
the
negro
down
who
unable
to
regain
his
feet
finally
whether
from
fear
or
exhaustion
lay
inert
until
the
constable
having
worked
off
his
worst
anger
and
not
deeming
it
to
his
advantage
seriously
to
disable
the
prisoner
in
whom
he
had
a
pecuniary
interest
desisted
from
further
punishment
i
might
send
you
to
the
penitentiary
for
this
he
said
panting
for
breath
but
i
send
you
to
h
ll
instead
you
be
sold
back
to
fetters
for
a
year
or
two
tomorrow
and
in
three
months
i
be
down
at
sycamore
as
an
overseer
and
then
i
learn
you
to
strike
a
white
man
you
the
remainder
of
the
objurgation
need
not
be
told
but
there
was
no
doubt
from
the
expression
on
haines
face
that
he
meant
what
he
said
and
that
he
would
take
pleasure
in
repaying
in
overflowing
measure
any
arrears
of
revenge
against
the
offending
prisoner
which
he
might
consider
his
due
he
had
stirred
bud
up
very
successfully
much
more
so
indeed
than
he
had
really
intended
he
had
meant
to
procure
evidence
against
bud
but
had
hardly
thought
to
carry
it
away
in
the
shape
of
a
black
eye
and
a
swollen
nose
when
the
colonel
set
out
next
morning
for
a
walk
down
the
main
street
he
had
just
breakfasted
on
boiled
brook
trout
fresh
laid
eggs
hot
muffins
and
coffee
and
was
feeling
at
peace
with
all
mankind
he
was
alone
having
left
phil
in
charge
of
the
hotel
housekeeper
he
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
when
he
reached
a
door
around
which
several
men
were
lounging
and
from
which
came
the
sound
of
voices
and
loud
laughter
stopping
he
looked
with
some
curiosity
into
the
door
over
which
there
was
a
faded
sign
to
indicate
that
it
was
the
office
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
a
pleasing
collocation
of
words
to
those
who
could
divorce
it
from
any
technical
significance
justice
peace
the
seed
and
the
flower
of
civilisation
an
unwashed
young
negro
clothed
in
rags
unspeakably
vile
which
scarcely
concealed
his
nakedness
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
white
men
toward
whom
he
threw
now
and
then
a
shallow
and
shifty
glance
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
and
the
floor
dotted
with
discarded
portions
of
the
weed
a
white
man
stood
beside
a
desk
and
was
addressing
the
audience
now
gentlemen
here
lot
number
three
a
likely
young
nigger

answers
to
the

of

look
at
but
will
make
a
good
field

looked

kept
away
from

who
plays
the
banjo
an
sings
like
a
like
a
blackbird
what
am
i
bid
for
this
prime
lot
the
negro
threw
a
dull
glance
around
the
crowd
with
an
air
of
detachment
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
at
all
interested
in
the
proceedings
the
colonel
viewed
the
scene
with
something
more
than
curious
interest
the
fellow
looked
like
an
habitual
criminal
or
at
least
like
a
confirmed
loafer
this
must
be
one
of
the
idle
and
worthless
blacks
with
so
many
of
whom
the
south
was
afflicted
this
was
doubtless
the
method
provided
by
law
for
dealing
with
them
one
year
answered
a
voice
nine
months
said
a
second
six
months
came
a
third
bid
from
a
tall
man
with
a
buggy
whip
under
his
arm
are
you
all
through
gentlemen
six
months
labour
for
fifty
is
mighty
cheap
and
you
know
the
law
allows
you
to
keep
the
labourer
up
to
the
mark
are
you
all
done
sold
to
turner
for
fetters
for
six
months
the
prisoner
dull
face
showed
some
signs
of
apprehension
when
the
name
of
his
purchaser
was
pronounced
and
he
shambled
away
uneasily
under
the
constable
vigilant
eye
the
case
of
the
state
against
bud
johnson
is
next
in
order
bring
in
the
prisoner
the
constable
brought
in
the
prisoner
handcuffed
and
placed
him
in
front
of
the
justice
desk
where
he
remained
standing
he
was
a
short
powerfully
built
negro
seemingly
of
pure
blood
with
a
head
not
unduly
low
in
the
brow
and
quite
broad
between
the
ears
under
different
circumstances
his
countenance
might
have
been
pleasing
at
present
it
was
set
in
an
expression
of
angry
defiance
he
had
walked
with
a
slight
limp
there
were
several
contusions
upon
his
face
and
upon
entering
the
room
he
had
thrown
a
defiant
glance
around
him
which
had
not
quailed
even
before
the
stern
eye
of
the
tall
man
turner
who
as
the
agent
of
the
absent
fetters
had
bid
on
sam
brown
his
face
then
hardened
into
the
blank
expression
of
one
who
stands
in
a
hostile
presence
bud
johnson
said
the
justice
you
are
charged
with
escaping
from
the
service
into

fine
and
costs

of

what
do

plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
the
prisoner
maintained
a
sullen
silence
i
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
the
record
of
this
court
shows
that
you
were
convicted
of
vagrancy
on

four
months
to
pay

fine
and

haines
swore
that
the
prisoner
had
resisted

and
had
only
been
captured
by
the
display
of
a
loaded
revolver
the
prisoner
was
convicted
and
fined
dollars
and
costs
for
this
second
offense
the
third
charge
for
disorderly
conduct
in
prison
was
quickly
disposed
of
and
a
fine
of
dollars
and
costs
levied
you
may
consider
lucky
said
the
magistrate
that
haines
did
prefer
a
mo
serious
charge
against
you
many
a
nigger
has
gone
to
the
gallows
for
less
and
now
gentlemen
i
want
to
clean
this
case
up
right
here
how
much
time
is
offered
for
the
fine

costs
of
the
prisoner
bud
johnson
amounting
to
dollars

and
dollars
and
cents

you
heard
the
evidence
an
you
see
the
nigger
ef
there
ai
much
competition
for
his
services
and
the
time
is
a
long
one
he
have
his
own
stubbornness
an
deviltry
to
thank
for
it
he
strong
and
healthy
and
able
to
do
good
work
for
any
one
that
can
manage
him
there
was
no
immediate
response
turner
walked
forward
and
viewed
the
prisoner
from
head
to
foot
with
a
coldly
sneering
look
well
bud
he
said
i
reckon
we
hafter
try
it
i
have
never
yet
allowed
a
nigger
to
git
the
better
o
me
an
moreover
i
never
will
i
bid
eighteen
months
squire
an
that
all
worth
with
his
keep
there
was
no
competition
and
the
prisoner
was
knocked
down
to
turner
for
fetters
for
eighteen
months
lock
up
till
i
ready
to
go
bill
said
turner
to
the
constable
an
just
leave
the
irons
on
him
i
fetch
back
next
time
i
come
to
town
the
unconscious
brutality
of
the
proceeding
grated
harshly
upon
the
colonel
nerves
delinquents
of
some
kind
these
men
must
be
who
were
thus
dealt
with
but
he
had
lived
away
from
the
south
so
long
that
so
sudden
an
introduction
to
some
of
its
customs
came
with
something
of
a
shock
he
had
remembered
the
pleasant
things
and
these
but
vaguely
since
his
thoughts
and
his
interests
had
been
elsewhere
and
in
the
sifting
process
of
a
healthy
memory
he
had
forgotten
the
disagreeable
things
altogether
he
had
found
the
pleasant
things
still
in
existence
faded
but
still
fragrant
fresh
from
a
land
of
labour
unions
and
of
struggle
for
wealth
and
power
of
strivings
first
for
equality
with
those
above
and
this
attained
for
a
point
of
vantage
to
look
down
upon
former
equals
he
had
found
in
old
peter
only
the
day
before
a
touching
loyalty
to
a
family
from
which
he
could
no
longer
expect
anything
in
return
fresh
from
a
land
of
women
clubs
and
women
claims
he
had
reveled
last
night
in
the
charming
domestic
life
of
the
old
south
so
perfectly
preserved
in
a
quiet
household
things
southern
as
he
had
already
reflected
lived
long
and
died
hard
and
these
things
which
he
saw
now
in
the
clear
light
of
day
were
also
of
the
south
and
singularly
suggestive
of
other
things
southern
which
he
had
supposed
outlawed
and
discarded
long
ago
now
haines
bring
in
the
next
lot
said
the
squire
the
constable
led
out
an
old
coloured
man
clad
in
a
quaint
assortment
of
tattered
garments
whom
the
colonel
did
not
for
a
moment
recognise
not
having
from
where
he
stood
a
full
view
of
the
prisoner
face
gentlemen
i
now
call
attention
to
lot
number
fo
left
over
from
befo
the
wah
not
much
for
looks
but
respectful
and
obedient
and
accustomed
for
some
time
past
to
eat
very
little

be
made
useful
in
many
ways

of

a
good
skeercrow
what
i
am
bid
gentlemen
for
peter
french
the
amount
due
the
is
dollahs
and
a
half
there
was
some
laughter
at
the
squire
facetiousness
turner
who
had
bid
on
the
young
and
strong
men
turned
away
unconcernedly
you
made
a
good
auctioneer
squire
said
the
man
thank
you
pearsall
how
much

i
offered
for
this
bargain

one

a
third

another
he

in
five
and
you
have
to
bury
him
i
withdraw
the
bid
said
bennet
promptly
two
yeahs
said
another
the
colonel
was
boiling
over
with
indignation
his
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
other
prisoners
had
been
merely
abstract
in
old
case
it
assumed
a
personal
aspect
he
forced
himself
into
the
room
and
to
the
front
may
i
ask
the
meaning
of
this
proceeding
he
demanded
well
suh
replied
the
justice
i
do
know
who
you
are
or
what
right
you
have
to
interfere
but
this
is
the
sale
of
a
vagrant
nigger
with
no
visible
means
of
perhaps
since
you
interested
you
like
to
bid
on
are
you
from
the
likely
yes
i
thought
suh

you
looked
like
a

that
bein
so
doubtless

somethin
on
the
uncle
tom
order
old
fine

twenty
dollars
and
the
costs

and
a
half
the
prisoner
time
is
sold
to
whoever
pays
his
fine
and
allows
him
the
shortest
time
to
work
it
out
when
his
time
up
he
goes
free
and
what
has
old
peter
done
to
deserve
a
fine
of
twenty
dollars
more
money
than
he
perhaps
has
ever
had
at
any
one
time
it
is
mars
henry
it
is
exclaimed
peter
fervently
peter
has
not
been
able
replied
the
magistrate
to
show
this
that
he
has
employment
or
means
of
and
he
was
therefore
tried
and
convicted
yesterday
evenin
of
vagrancy
under
our
state
law
the
fine
is
intended
to
discourage
laziness
and
to
promote
industry
do
you
want
to
bid
suh
i
offered
two
yeahs
gentlemen
for
old
peter
french
does
anybody
wish
to
make
it
less
i
pay
the
fine
said
the
colonel
let
him
go
i
beg
yo
pahdon
suh
but
that
would
fulfil
the
of
the
law
he
be
subject
to
arrest
again
immediately
somebody
must
take
the
responsibility
for
his
keep
i
look
after
him
said
the
colonel
shortly
in
order
to
keep
the
docket
straight
said
the
justice
i
should
want
to
note
yo
bid
how
long
shall
i
say
say
what
you
like
said
the
colonel
drawing
out
his
pocketbook

turner
asked
the
justice
not
by
a
damn
sight
replied
turner
with
native
elegance
i
buy
niggers
to
work
not
to
bury
i
withdraw
my
bid
in
favour
of
the
gentleman
said
the
bidder

the
colonel
remember
suh
said
the
justice
to
the
colonel
that
you
are
responsible
for
his
keep
as
well
as
entitled
to
his
labour
for
the
period
of
your
bid
how
long
shall
i
make
it
as
long
as
you
please
said
the
colonel
impatiently
sold
said
the
justice
bringing
down
his
gavel
for
life
to
what
name
suh
french
henry
french
there
was
some
manifestation
of
interest
in
the
crowd
and
the
colonel
was
stared
at
with
undisguised
curiosity
as
he
paid
the
fine
and
costs
which
included
two
dollars
for
two
meals
in
the
guardhouse
and
walked
away
with
his
purchase
a
purchase
which
his
father
had
made
upon
terms
not
very
different
fifty
years
before
one
of
the
old
frenches
i
reckon
said
a
bystander
come
back
on
a
visit
yes
said
another
old
roun
here
well
they
ought
to
take
keer
of
their
old
niggers
they
got
all
the
good
out
of
when
they
were
young
but
they
not
runnin
things
now
an
hour
later
the
colonel
driving
leisurely
about
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
seeking
to
connect
his
memories
more
closely
with
the
scenes
around
him
met
a
buggy
in
which
sat
the
man
turner
after
the
buggy
tied
behind
one
another
to
a
rope
like
a
coffle
of
slaves
marched
the
three
negroes
whose
time
he
had
bought
at
the
sale
among
them
of
course
was
the
young
man
who
had
been
called
bud
johnson
the
colonel
observed
that
this
negro
face
when
turned
toward
the
white
man
in
front
of
him
expressed
a
fierce
hatred
as
of
some
wild
thing
of
the
woods
which
finding
itself
trapped
and
betrayed
would
go
to
any
length
to
injure
its
captor
turner
passed
the
colonel
with
no
sign
of
recognition
or
greeting
bud
johnson
evidently
recognised
the
friendly
gentleman
who
had
interfered
in
peter
case
he
threw
toward
the
colonel
a
look
which
resembled
an
appeal
but
it
was
involuntary
and
lasted
but
a
moment
and
when
the
prisoner
became
conscious
of
it
and
realised
its
uselessness
it
faded
into
the
former
expression
what
the
man
story
was
the
colonel
did
not
know
nor
what
were
his
deserts
but
the
events
of
the
day
had
furnished
food
for
reflection
evidently
clarendon
needed
new
light
and
leading
men
even
black
men
with
something
to
live
for
and
with
work
at
living
wages
would
scarcely
prefer
an
enforced
servitude
in
ropes
and
chains
and
the
punishment
had
scarcely
seemed
to
fit
the
crime
he
had
observed
no
great
zeal
for
work
among
the
white
people
since
he
came
to
town
such
work
as
he
had
seen
done
was
mostly
performed
by
negroes
if
idleness
were
a
crime
the
negroes
surely
had
no
monopoly
of
it
furnished
with
money
for
his
keep
peter
was
ordered
if
again
molested
to
say
that
he
was
in
the
colonel
service
the
latter
since
his
own
plans
were
for
the
present
uncertain
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
what
disposition
he
would
ultimately
make
of
the
old
man
but
he
meant
to
provide
in
some
way
for
his
declining
years
he
also
bought
peter
a
neat
suit
of
clothes
at
a
clothing
store
and
directed
him
to
present
himself
at
the
hotel
on
the
following
morning
the
interval
would
give
the
colonel
time
to
find
something
for
peter
to
do
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
pay
him
a
wage
to
his
contract
with
the
county
he
attached
little
importance
he
had
already
intended
since
their
meeting
in
the
cemetery
to
provide
for
peter
in
some
way
and
the
legal
responsibility
was
no
additional
burden
to
peter
himself
to
whose
homeless
old
age
food
was
more
than
philosophy
the
arrangement
seemed
entirely
satisfactory
colonel
french
presence
in
clarendon
had
speedily
become
known
to
the
public
upon
his
return
to
the
hotel
after
leaving
peter
to
his
own
devices
for
the
day
he
found
several
cards
in
his
letter
box
left
by
gentlemen
who
had
called
during
his
absence
to
see
him
the
daily
mail
had
also
come
in
and
the
colonel
sat
down
in
the
office
to
read
it
there
was
a
club
notice
and
several
letters
that
had
been
readdressed
and
forwarded
and
a
long
one
from
kirby
in
reference
to
some
detail
of
the
recent
transfer
before
he
had
finished
reading
these
a
gentleman
came
up
and
introduced
himself
he
proved
to
be
one
john
mclean
an
old
schoolmate
of
the
colonel
and
later
a
though
the
colonel
would
never
have
recognised
a
rather
natty
major
in
his
own
regiment
in
this
shabby
man
whose
shoes
were
run
down
at
the
heel
whose
linen
was
doubtful
and
spotted
with
tobacco
juice
the
major
talked
about
the
weather
which
was
cool
for
the
season
about
the
civil
war
about
politics
and
about
the
negroes
who
were
very
trifling
the
major
said
while
they
were
talking
upon
this
latter
theme
there
was
some
commotion
in
the
street
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
looking
up
they
saw
that
a
horse
attached
to
a
loaded
wagon
had
fallen
in
the
roadway
and
having
become
entangled
in
the
harness
was
kicking
furiously
five
or
six
negroes
were
trying
to
quiet
the
animal
and
release
him
from
the
shafts
while
a
dozen
white
men
looked
on
and
made
suggestions
an
illustration
said
the
major
pointing
through
the
window
toward
the
scene
without
of
what
we
got
to
contend
with
six
niggers
ca
get
one
horse
up
without
twice
as
many
white
men
to
tell
them
how
that
why
the
south
is
behind
the
the
niggers
in
one
way
or
another
take
up
most
of
our
time
and
energy
you
folks
up
there
have
half
your
work
done
before
we
get
started
the
horse
pulled
this
way
and
that
in
obedience
to
the
conflicting
advice
of
the
bystanders
only
became
more
and
more
intricately
entangled
he
had
caught
one
foot
in
a
manner
that
threatened
with
each
frantic
jerk
to
result
in
a
broken
leg
when
the
colonel
leaving
his
visitor
without
ceremony
ran
out
into
the
street
leaned
down
and
with
a
few
movements
released
the
threatened
limb
now
boys
he
said
laying
hold
of
the
prostrate
animal
give
a
hand
here
the
negroes
and
after
some
slight
hesitation
one
or
two
white
men
came
to
the
colonel
aid
and
in
a
moment
the
horse
trembling
and
blowing
was
raised
to
its
feet
the
driver
thanked
the
colonel
and
the
others
who
had
befriended
him
and
proceeded
with
his
load
when
the
flurry
of
excitement
was
over
the
colonel
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
resumed
the
conversation
with
his
friend
if
the
new
franchise
amendment
went
through
said
the
major
the
negro
would
be
eliminated
from
politics
and
the
people
of
the
south
relieved
of
the
fear
of
nigger
domination
could
give
their
attention
to
better
things
and
their
section
would
move
forward
along
the
path
of
progress
by
leaps
and
bounds
of
himself
the
major
said
little
except
that
he
had
been
an
alternate
delegate
to
the
last
democratic
national
nominating
convention
and
that
he
expected
to
run
for
coroner
at
the
next
county
election
if
i
can
secure
the
of
fetters
in
the
primaries
he
said
my
nomination
is
assured
and
a
nomination
is
of
equivalent
to
an
election
but
i
see
there
are
some
other
gentlemen
that
would
like
to
talk
to
you
and
i
wo
take
any
mo
of
yo
time
at
present
blake
he
said
addressing
a
gentleman
with
short
who
was
approaching
them
have
you
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
colonel
french
no
suh
said
the
stranger
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
honour
of
an
introduction
at
your
hands
colonel
french
blake
blake
colonel
french
you
gentlemen
will
probably
like
to
talk
to
one
another
because
you
both
belong
to
the
same
party
i
reckon
blake
is
a
new
man
roun
heah
come
down
from
the
mountains
not
mo
than
ten
yeahs
ago
an
fetched
his
politics
with
him
but
since
he
was
born
that
way
we
do
entertain
any
malice
against
him
he
not
a
and
tan
republican
but
a
white
yes
sir
said
blake
taking
the
colonel
hand
i
believe
in
white
supremacy
and
the
elimination
of
the
nigger
vote
if
the
national
republican
party
would
only
ignore
the
coloured
politicians
and
give
all
the
offices
to
white
men
we
soon
build
up
a
strong
white
republican
party
if
i
had
the
here
at
clarendon
with
the
encouragement
it
would
give
and
the
aid
of
my
clerks
and
i
could
double
the
white
republican
vote
in
this
county
in
six
months
the
major
had
left
them
together
and
the
lily
white
ere
he
in
turn
made
way
for
another
caller
suggested
delicately
that
he
would
appreciate
any
good
word
that
the
colonel
might
be
able
to
say
for
him
in
influential
quarters
either
personally
or
through
friends
who
might
have
the
ear
of
the
executive
or
those
close
to
him
in
reference
to
the
postmastership
realising
that
the
present
administration
was
a
business
one
in
which
sentiment
played
small
part
he
had
secured
the
endorsement
of
the
leading
business
men
of
the
county
even
that
of
fetters
himself
fetters
was
of
course
a
democrat
but
preferred
since
the
office
must
go
to
a
republican
that
it
should
go
to
a
lily
white
i
hope
to
see
mo
of
you
sir
he
said
and
i
take
pleasure
in
introducing
the
honourable
henry
clay
appleton
editor
of
our
local
newspaper
the
he
and
i
may
not
agree
on
free
silver
and
the
tariff
but
we
are
entirely
in
harmony
on
the
subject
indicated
by
the
title
of
his
newspaper
appleton
not
only
furnishes
all
the
news
that
fit
to
read
but
he
represents
this
county
in
the
legislature
along
with
fetters
and
he
will
no
doubt
be
the
next
candidate
for
congress
from
this
district
he
can
tell
you
all
that
worth
knowin
about
clarendon
the
colonel
shook
hands
with
the
editor
who
had
come
with
a
twofold
intent
to
make
the
visitor
acquaintance
and
to
interview
him
upon
his
impressions
of
the
south
incidentally
he
gave
the
colonel
a
great
deal
of
information
about
local
conditions
these
were
not
he
admitted
ideal
the
town
was
backward
it
needed
capital
to
develop
its
resources
and
it
needed
to
be
rid
of
the
fear
of
negro
domination
the
suffrage
in
the
hands
of
the
negroes
had
proved
a
ghastly
and
expensive
joke
for
all
concerned
and
the
public
welfare
absolutely
demanded
that
it
be
taken
away
even
the
white
republicans
were
coming
around
to
the
same
point
of
view
the
new
franchise
amendment
to
the
state
constitution
was
receiving
their
unqualified
support
that
was
a
fine
chivalrous
deed
of
yours
this
morning
sir
he
said
at
squire
reddick
office
it
was
just
what
might
have
been
expected
from
a
southern
gentleman
for
we
claim
you
colonel
in
spite
of
your
long
absence
yes
returned
the
colonel
i
do
know
what
i
rescued
old
peter
from
it
looked
pretty
dark
for
him
there
for
a
little
while
i
should
have
envied
his
fate
had
he
been
bought
in
by
the
tall
fellow
who
represented
your
colleague
in
the
legislature
the
law
seems
harsh
well
admitted
the
editor
i
suppose
it
might
seem
harsh
in
comparison
with
your
milder
penal
systems
up
north
but
you
must
consider
the
circumstances
and
make
allowances
for
us
we
have
so
many
idle
ignorant
negroes
that
something
must
be
done
to
make
them
work
or
else
they
steal
and
to
keep
them
in
their
place
or
they
would
run
over
us
the
law
has
been
in
operation
only
a
year
or
two
and
is
already
having
its
effect
i
be
glad
to
introduce
a
bill
for
its
repeal
as
soon
as
it
is
no
longer
needed
you
must
bear
in
mind
too
colonel
that
niggers
do
look
at
imprisonment
and
enforced
labour
in
the
same
way
white
people
do
they
are
not
conscious
of
any
disgrace
attending
stripes
or
the
ball
and
chain
the
state
is
poor
our
white
children
are
suffering
for
lack
of
education
and
yet
we
have
to
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
the
negro
schools
these
convict
labour
contracts
are
a
source
of
considerable
revenue
to
the
state
they
make
up
in
fact
for
most
of
the
outlay
for
negro
education
which
i
approve
of
though
i
frank
to
say
that
so
far
i
do
see
much
good
that
come
from
it
this
convict
labour
is
humanely
treated
fetters
has
the
contract
for
several
counties
and
anybody
who
knows
fetters
knows
that
no
man
in
the
south
the
colonel
disclaimed
any
intention
of
criticising
he
had
come
back
to
his
old
home
for
a
brief
visit
to
rest
and
to
observe
he
was
willing
to
learn
and
anxious
to
please
the
editor
took
copious
notes
of
the
interview
and
upon
his
departure
shook
hands
with
the
colonel
cordially
the
colonel
had
tactfully
let
his
visitors
talk
while
he
listened
or
dropped
a
word
here
and
there
to
draw
them
out
one
fact
was
driven
home
to
him
by
every
one
to
whom
he
had
spoken
fetters
dominated
the
county
and
the
town
and
apparently
the
state
his
name
was
on
every
lip
his
influence
was
indispensable
to
every
political
aspirant
his
acquaintance
was
something
to
boast
of
and
his
good
will
held
a
promise
of
success
and
the
colonel
had
once
kicked
the
honourable
fetters
then
plain
bill
in
presence
of
an
admiring
audience
all
the
way
down
main
street
from
the
academy
to
the
bank
bill
had
been
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
poor
white
boy
who
could
not
have
named
with
certainty
his
own
grandfather
the
honourable
william
was
undoubtedly
a
man
of
great
ability
had
the
colonel
remained
in
his
native
state
would
he
have
been
able
he
wondered
to
impress
himself
so
deeply
upon
the
community
would
blood
have
been
of
any
advantage
under
the
changed
conditions
or
would
it
have
been
a
drawback
to
one
who
sought
political
advancement
when
the
colonel
was
left
alone
he
went
to
look
for
phil
who
was
playing
with
the
children
of
the
landlord
in
the
hotel
parlour
commending
him
to
the
care
of
the
negro
maid
in
charge
of
them
he
left
the
hotel
and
called
on
several
gentlemen
whose
cards
he
had
found
in
his
box
at
the
clerk
desk
their
stores
and
offices
were
within
a
short
radius
of
the
hotel
they
were
all
glad
to
see
him
and
if
there
was
any
initial
stiffness
or
shyness
in
the
attitude
of
any
one
it
soon
became
the
warmest
cordiality
under
the
influence
of
the
colonel
simple
and
unostentatious
bearing
if
he
compared
the
cut
of
their
clothes
or
their
beards
to
his
own
to
their
disadvantage
or
if
he
found
their
views
narrow
and
provincial
he
gave
no
sign
their
hearts
were
warm
and
their
welcome
hearty
the
colonel
was
not
able
to
gather
from
the
conversation
of
his
friends
that
clarendon
or
any
one
in
the
town
always
excepting
fetters
who
did
not
live
in
the
town
but
merely
overshadowed
it
was
especially
prosperous
there
were
no
mills
or
mines
in
the
neighbourhood
except
a
few
grist
mills
and
a
sawmill
the
bulk
of
the
business
consisted
in
supplying
the
needs
of
an
agricultural
population
and
trading
in
their
products
the
cotton
was
baled
and
shipped
to
the
north
and
for
domestic
use
in
the
shape
of
sheeting
and
other
stuffs
the
corn
was
shipped
to
the
north
and
came
back
in
the
shape
of
corn
meal
and
salt
pork
the
staple
articles
of
diet
beefsteak
and
butter
were
brought
from
the
north
at
and
fifty
cents
a
pound
respectively
there
were
cotton
merchants
and
corn
and
feed
merchants
there
were
and
grocery
stores
drug
stores
and
saloons
and
more
saloons
and
the
usual
proportion
of
professional
men
since
clarendon
was
the
county
seat
there
were
of
course
a
court
house
and
a
jail
there
were
churches
enough
if
all
filled
at
once
to
hold
the
entire
population
of
the
town
and
preachers
in
proportion
the
merchants
of
whom
a
number
were
jewish
periodically
went
into
bankruptcy
the
majority
of
their
customers
did
likewise
and
thus
a
was
promoted
and
the
loss
thrown
back
as
far
as
possible
the
lands
of
the
large
farmers
were
mostly
mortgaged
either
to
fetters
or
to
the
bank
of
which
he
was
the
chief
stockholder
for
all
that
could
be
borrowed
on
them
while
the
small
farmers
many
of
whom
were
coloured
were
practically
tied
to
the
soil
by
ropes
of
debt
and
chains
of
contract
every
one
the
colonel
met
during
the
afternoon
had
heard
of
squire
reddick
good
joke
of
the
morning
that
he
should
have
sold
peter
to
the
colonel
for
life
was
regarded
as
extremely
clever
some
of
them
knew
old
peter
and
none
of
them
had
ever
known
any
harm
of
him
and
they
were
unanimous
in
their
recognition
and
applause
of
the
goodheartedness
moreover
it
was
an
index
of
the
colonel
views
he
was
one
of
them
by
descent
and
early
associations
but
he
had
been
away
a
long
time
and
they
had
really
known
how
much
of
a
yankee
he
might
have
become
by
his
whimsical
and
kindly
purchase
of
old
time
or
of
old
peter
as
they
smilingly
put
it
he
had
shown
his
appreciation
of
the
helplessness
of
the
negroes
and
of
their
proper
relations
to
the
whites
what
you
do
with
him
colonel
asked
one
gentleman
an
ole
nigger
like
peter
could
live
in
the
col
you
have
to
buy
a
place
down
here
to
keep
they
wouldn
let
you
own
a
nigger
at
the
the
remark
with
the
genial
laugh
accompanying
it
was
sounding
in
the
colonel
ears
as
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
he
stepped
into
the
barber
shop
the
barber
who
had
also
heard
the
story
was
bursting
with
a
desire
to
unbosom
himself
upon
the
subject
knowing
from
experience
that
white
gentlemen
in
their
intercourse
with
coloured
people
were
apt
to
be
in
the
local
phrase
sometimey
or
uncertain
in
their
moods
he
first
tested
with
a
few
remarks
about
the
weather
the
colonel
amiability
and
finding
him
approachable
proved
quite
talkative
and
confidential

i

while
the
barber
babbled
on
with
his
shrewd
flattery
which
was
sincere
enough
to
carry
a
reasonable
amount
of
conviction
the
colonel
listened
with
curiously
mingled
feelings
he
recalled
each
plank
each
pane
of
glass
every
inch
of
wall
in
the
old
house
no
spot
was
without
its
associations
how
many
a
brilliant
scene
of
gaiety
had
taken
place
in
the
spacious
parlour
where
bright
eyes
had
sparkled
merry
feet
had
twinkled
and
young
hearts
beat
high
with
love
and
hope
and
joy
of
living
and
not
only
joy
had
passed
that
way
but
sorrow
in
the
front
upper
chamber
his
mother
had
died
vividly
he
recalled
as
with
closed
eyes
he
lay
back
under
the
barber
skilful
hand
their
last
parting
and
his
own
poignant
grief
for
she
had
been
not
only
his
mother
but
a
woman
of
character
who
commanded
respect
and
inspired
affection
a
beautiful
woman
whom
he
had
loved
with
a
devotion
that
bordered
on
reverence
romance
too
had
waved
her
magic
wand
over
the
old
homestead
his
memory
smiled
indulgently
as
he
recalled
one
scene
in
a
corner
of
the
broad
piazza
he
had
poured
out
his
youthful
heart
one
summer
evening
in
strains
of
passionate
devotion
to
his
first
love
a
beautiful
woman
of
thirty
who
was
visiting
his
mother
and
who
had
told
him
between
smiles
and
tears
to
be
a
good
boy
and
wait
a
little
longer
until
he
was
sure
of
his
own
mind
even
now
he
breathed
in
memory
the
heavy
odour
of
the
magnolia
blossoms
which
overhung
the
long
wooden
porch
bench
or
jogging
board
on
which
the
lady
sat
while
he
knelt
on
the
hard
floor
before
her
he
felt
very
young
indeed
after
she
had
spoken
but
her
caressing
touch
upon
his
hair
had
so
stirred
his
heart
that
his
vanity
had
suffered
no
wound
why
the
family
had
owned
the
house
since
they
had
owned
the
cemetery
lot
it
was
hallowed
by
a
hundred
memories
and
now
will
you
have
oil
on
yo
hair
suh
or
bay
rum
nichols
exclaimed
the
colonel
i
should
like
to
buy
back
the
old
house
what
do
you
want
for
it
why
colonel
stammered
the
barber
somewhat
taken
aback
at
the
suddenness
of
the
offer
i
hadn
thought
sellin
it
you
see
suh
i
had
it
now
for
twenty
years
and
it
suits
me
an
my
has
growed
up
in
it
an
it
kind
of
has
associations
suh
in
principle
the
colonel
was
an
ardent
democrat
he
believed
in
the
rights
of
man
and
extended
the
doctrine
to
include
all
who
bore
the
human
form
but
in
feeling
he
was
an
equally
pronounced
aristocrat
a
servant
rights
he
would
have
defended
to
the
last
ditch
familiarity
he
would
have
resented
with
equal
positiveness
something
of
this
ancestral
feeling
stirred
within
him
now
while
nichols
position
in
reference
to
the
house
was
in
principle
equally
as
correct
as
the
colonel
own
and
superior
in
point
of
time
since
impressions
like
photographs
are
apt
to
grow
dim
with
age
and
nichols
were
of
much
more
recent
date
the
barber
display
of
sentiment
only
jarred
the
colonel
sensibilities
and
strengthened
his
desire
i
should
advise
you
to
speak
up
nichols
said
the
colonel
i
had
no
notion
of
buying
the
place
when
i
came
in
and
i
may
not
be
of
the
same
mind
name
your
own
price
but
now
your
time
the
barber
caught
his
breath
such
dispatch
was
in
clarendon
but
nichols
a
mulatto
was
a
man
of
thrift
and
good
sense
he
would
have
liked
to
consult
his
wife
and
children
about
the
sale
but
to
lose
an
opportunity
to
make
a
good
profit
was
to
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
the
house
was
very
old
it
needed
shingling
and
painting
the
floors
creaked
the
plaster
on
the
walls
was
loose
the
chimneys
needed
pointing
and
the
insurance
was
soon
renewable
he
owned
a
smaller
house
in
which
he
could
live
he
had
been
told
to
name
his
price
it
was
as
much
better
to
make
it
too
high
than
too
low
as
it
was
easier
to
come
down
than
to
go
up
the
purchaser
was
a
rich
man
the
diamond
on
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
alone
would
buy
a
small
house
i
think
suh
he
said
at
a
bold
venture
that
fo
thousand
dollars
would
be
right
i
take
it
returned
the
colonel
taking
out
his
here
fifty
dollars
to
bind
the
bargain
i
write
a
receipt
for
you
to
sign
the
barber
brought
pen
ink
and
paper
and
restrained
his
excitement
sufficiently
to
keep
silent
while
the
colonel
wrote
a
receipt
embodying
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
signed
it
with
a
steady
hand
have
the
deed
drawn
up
as
soon
as
you
like
said
the
colonel
as
he
left
the
shop
and
when
it
is
done
i
give
you
a
draft
for
the
money
yes
suh
thank
you
suh
thank
you
colonel
the
barber
had
bought
the
house
at
a
tax
sale
at
a
time
of
great
financial
distress
twenty
years
before
for
five
hundred
dollars
he
had
made
a
very
good
sale
and
he
lost
no
time
in
having
the
deed
drawn
up
when
the
colonel
reached
the
hotel
he
found
phil
seated
on
the
doorstep
with
a
little
black
boy
and
a
little
white
dog
phil
who
had
a
large
heart
had
fraternised
with
the
boy
and
fallen
in
love
with
the
dog
papa
he
said
i
want
to
buy
this
dog
his
name
is
rover
he
can
shake
hands
and
i
like
him
very
much
this
little
boy
wants
ten
cents
for
him
and
i
did
not
have
the
money
i
asked
him
to
wait
until
you
came
may
i
buy
him
certainly
phil
here
boy
the
colonel
threw
the
black
boy
a
silver
dollar
phil
took
the
dog
under
his
arm
and
followed
his
father
into
the
house
while
the
other
boy
his
glistening
eyes
glued
to
the
coin
in
his
hand
scampered
off
as
fast
as
his
limbs
would
carry
him
he
was
back
next
morning
with
a
pretty
white
kitten
but
the
colonel
discouraged
any
further
purchases
for
the
time
being
my
dear
laura
said
the
colonel
when
he
saw
his
friend
the
same
evening
i
have
been
in
clarendon
two
days
and
i
have
already
bought
a
dog
a
house
and
a
man
miss
laura
was
startled
i
do
understand
she
said
the
colonel
proceeded
to
explain
the
transaction
by
which
he
had
acquired
for
life
the
services
of
old
peter
i
suppose
it
is
the
law
miss
laura
said
but
it
seems
hardly
right
i
had
thought
we
were
well
rid
of
slavery
white
men
do
not
work
any
too
much
old
peter
was
not
idle
he
did
odd
jobs
when
he
could
get
them
he
was
polite
and
respectful
and
it
was
an
outrage
to
treat
him
so
i
am
glad
you
hired
him
yes
hired
him
moreover
laura
i
have
bought
a
house
a
house
then
you
are
going
to
stay
i
am
so
glad
we
shall
all
be
so
glad
what
house
the
old
place
i
went
into
the
barber
shop
the
barber
complimented
me
on
the
family
taste
in
architecture
and
grew
sentimental
about
associations
with
the
house
this
awoke
associations
and
the
collocation
jarred
i
was
selfish
enough
to
want
a
monopoly
of
the
associations
i
bought
the
house
from
him
before
i
left
the
shop
but
what
will
you
do
with
it
asked
miss
laura
puzzled
you
could
never
in
it
again
after
a
coloured
family
why
not
it
is
no
less
the
old
house
because
the
barber
has
reared
his
brood
beneath
its
roof
there
were
always
negroes
in
it
when
we
were
there
the
place
swarmed
with
them
hammer
and
plane
soap
and
water
paper
and
paint
can
make
it
new
again
the
barber
i
understand
is
a
worthy
man
and
has
reared
a
decent
family
his
daughter
plays
the
piano
and
sings
dreamt
that
i
dwelt
in
marble
halls
with
vassals
and
serfs
by
my
side
i
heard
her
as
i
passed
there
yesterday
miss
laura
gave
an
apprehensive
start
there
were
negroes
in
the
house
in
the
old
days
he
went
on
unnoticing
and
surely
a
good
old
house
gone
farther
astray
than
ours
might
still
be
redeemed
to
noble
ends
i
shall
renovate
it
and
live
in
it
while
i
am
here
and
at
such
times
as
i
may
return
or
if
i
should
tire
of
it
i
can
give
it
to
the
town
for
a
school
or
for
a
hospital
there
is
none
here
i
should
like
to
preserve
so
far
as
i
may
the
old
associations
associations
the
house
might
not
fall
again
into
hands
as
good
as
those
of
nichols
and
i
should
like
to
know
that
it
was
devoted
to
some
use
that
would
keep
the
old
name
alive
in
the
community
i
think
henry
said
miss
laura
that
if
your
visit
is
long
enough
you
will
do
more
for
the
town
than
if
you
had
remained
here
all
your
life
for
you
have
lived
in
a
wider
world
and
acquired
a
broader
view
and
you
have
learned
new
things
without
losing
your
love
for
the
old
the
deed
for
the
house
was
executed
on
friday
nichols
agreeing
to
give
possession
within
a
week
the
lavishness
of
the
purchase
price
was
a
subject
of
much
remark
in
the
town
and
nichols
good
fortune
was
congratulated
or
envied
according
to
the
temper
of
each
individual
the
colonel
action
in
old
peter
case
had
made
him
a
name
for
generosity
his
reputation
for
wealth
was
confirmed
by
this
reckless
prodigality
there
were
some
small
souls
of
course
among
the
lower
whites
who
were
heard
to
express
disgust
that
so
far
only
niggers
had
profited
by
the
colonel
visit
the
which
came
out
saturday
morning
gave
a
large
amount
of
space
to
colonel
french
and
his
doings
indeed
the
two
compositors
had
remained
up
late
the
night
before
setting
up
copy
and
the
pressman
had
not
reached
home
until
three
the
kerosene
oil
in
the
office
gave
out
and
it
was
necessary
to
rouse
a
grocer
at
midnight
to
replenish
the
supply
so
far
had
the
advent
of
colonel
french
affected
the
life
of
the
town
the
announced
that
colonel
henry
french
formerly
of
clarendon
who
had
won
distinction
in
the
confederate
army
and
since
the
war
achieved
fortune
at
the
north
had
returned
to
visit
his
birthplace
and
his
former
friends
the
hope
was
expressed
that
colonel
french
who
had
recently
sold
out
to
a
syndicate
his
bagging
mills
in
connecticut
might
seek
investments
in
the
south
whose
vast
undeveloped
resources
needed
only
the
fructifying
flow
of
abundant
capital
to
make
it
blossom
like
the
rose
the
new
south
the
declared
was
happy
to
welcome
capital
and
enterprise
and
hoped
that
colonel
french
might
find
in
clarendon
an
agreeable
residence
and
an
attractive
opening
for
his
trained
business
energies
that
something
of
the
kind
was
not
unlikely
might
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
colonel
french
had
already
repurchased
from
william
nichols
a
worthy
negro
barber
the
old
french
mansion
and
had
taken
into
his
service
a
former
servant
of
the
family
thus
foreshadowing
a
renewal
of
local
ties
and
a
prolonged
residence
the
conduct
of
the
colonel
in
the
matter
of
his
old
servant
was
warmly
commended
the
romantic
circumstances
of
their
meeting
in
the
cemetery
and
the
incident
in
the
justice
court
which
were
matters
of
public
knowledge
and
interest
showed
that
in
colonel
french
should
he
decide
to
resume
his
residence
in
clarendon
his
fellow
citizens
would
find
an
agreeable
neighbour
whose
sympathies
would
be
with
the
south
in
those
difficult
matters
upon
which
north
and
south
had
so
often
been
at
variance
but
upon
which
they
were
now
rapidly
becoming
one
in
sentiment
the
colonel
whose
active
mind
could
not
long
remain
unoccupied
was
busily
engaged
during
the
next
week
partly
in
making
plans
for
the
renovation
of
the
old
homestead
partly
in
correspondence
with
kirby
concerning
the
winding
up
of
the
loose
ends
of
their
former
business
thus
compelled
to
leave
phil
to
the
care
of
some
one
else
he
had
an
excellent
opportunity
to
utilise
peter
services
when
the
old
man
proud
of
his
new
clothes
and
relieved
of
any
responsibility
for
his
own
future
first
appeared
at
the
hotel
the
colonel
was
ready
with
a
commission
now
peter
he
said
i
going
to
prove
my
confidence
in
you
and
test
your
devotion
to
the
family
by
giving
you
charge
of
phil
you
may
come
and
get
him
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
you
can
get
your
meals
in
the
hotel
kitchen
and
take
him

streets
or

careful

other
words

good
care

the
child
i
like

uncle
peter
and
be
glad
to
go
with
you
phil
and
the
old
man
proved
excellent
friends
and
the
colonel
satisfied
that
the
boy
would
be
well
cared
for
gave
his
attention
to
the
business
of
the
hour
as
soon
as
nichols
moved
out
of
the
old
house
there
was
a
shaking
of
the
dry
bones
among
the
mechanics
of
the
town
a
small
army
of
workmen
invaded
the
premises
and
repairs
and
improvements
of
all
descriptions
went
rapidly
forward
much
more
rapidly
than
was
usual
in
clarendon
for
the
colonel
let
all
his
work
by
contract
and
by
a
system
of
forfeits
and
premiums
kept
it
going
at
high
pressure
in
two
weeks
the
house
was
shingled
painted
inside
and
out
the
fences
were
renewed
the
outhouses
renovated
and
the
grounds
put
in
order
the
stream
of
ready
money
thus
put
into
circulation
by
the
colonel
soon
permeated
all
the
channels
of
local
enterprise
the
barber
out
of
his
profits
began
the
erection
of
a
row
of
small
houses
for
coloured
tenants
this
gave
employment
to
masons
and
carpenters
and
involved
the
sale
and
purchase
of
considerable
building
material
general
trade
felt
the
influence
of
the
enhanced
prosperity
groceries
stores
and
saloons
did
a
thriving
business
the
ease
with
which
the
simply
organised
community
responded
to
so
slight
an
inflow
of
money
and
energy
was
not
without
a
pronounced
influence
upon
the
colonel
future
conduct
when
his
house
was
finished
colonel
french
hired
a
housekeeper
a
coloured
maid
a
cook
and
a
coachman
bought
several
horses
and
carriages
and
having
sent
to
new
york
for
his
books
and
pictures
and
several
articles
of
furniture
which
he
had
stored
there
began
housekeeping
in
his
own
establishment
succumbing
willingly
to
the
charm
of
old
associations
and
entering
more
fully
into
the
social
life
of
the
town
he
began
insensibly
to
think
of
clarendon
as
an
established
residence
where
he
would
look
forward
to
spending
a
certain
portion
of
each
year
the
climate
was
good
for
phil
and
to
bring
up
the
boy
safely
would
be
henceforth
his
chief
concern
in
life
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
old
town
the
ideas
of
race
and
blood
attained
a
new
and
larger
perspective
it
would
be
too
bad
for
an
old
family
with
a
fine
history
to
die
out
and
phil
was
the
latest
of
the
line
and
the
sole
hope
of
its
continuance
the
colonel
was
conscious
somewhat
guiltily
conscious
that
he
had
neglected
the
south
and
all
that
pertained
to
it
except
the
market
for
burlaps
and
bagging
which
several
southern
sales
agencies
had
attended
to
on
behalf
of
his
firm
he
was
aware
too
that
he
had
felt
a
certain
amount
of
contempt
for
its
poverty
its
quixotic
devotion
to
lost
causes
and
vanished
ideals
and
a
certain
disgusted
impatience
with
a
people
who
persistently
lagged
behind
in
the
march
of
progress
and
permitted
a
handful
of
upstart
blatant
demagogues
to
misrepresent
them
in
congress
and
before
the
country
by
intemperate
language
and
persistent
hostility
to
a
humble
but
large
and
important
part
of
their
own
constituency
but
he
was
glad
to
find
that
this
was
the
mere
froth
upon
the
surface
and
that
underneath
it
deep
down
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
the
currents
of
life
flowed
if
less
swiftly
not
less
purely
than
in
more
favoured
places
the
town
needed
an
element
which
he
could
in
a
measure
supply
by
residing
there
if
for
only
a
few
weeks
each
year
and
that
element
was
some
point
of
contact
with
the
outer
world
and
its
more
advanced
thought
he
might
induce
some
of
his
northern
friends
to
follow
his
example
there
were
many
for
whom
the
mild
climate
in
winter
and
the
restful
atmosphere
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
would
be
a
boon
which
correctly
informed
people
would
be
eager
to
enjoy
of
the
extent
to
which
the
influence
of
the
treadwell
household
had
contributed
to
this
frame
of
mind
the
colonel
was
not
conscious
he
had
received
the
freedom
of
the
town
and
many
hospitable
doors
were
open
to
him
as
a
single
man
with
an
interesting
little
motherless
child
he
did
not
lack
for
the
smiles
of
fair
ladies
of
which
the
town
boasted
not
a
few
but
treadwell
home
held
the
first
place
in
his
affections
he
had
been
there
first
and
first
impressions
are
vivid
they
had
been
kind
to
phil
who
loved
them
all
and
insisted
on
peter
taking
him
there
every
day
the
colonel
found
pleasure
in
miss
laura
sweet
simplicity
and
openness
of
character
to
which
graciella
vivacity
and
fresh
young
beauty
formed
an
attractive
counterpart
and
treadwell
plaintive
minor
note
had
soothed
and
satisfied
colonel
french
in
this
emotional
indian
summer
which
marked
his
reaction
from
a
long
and
arduous
business
career
in
addition
to
a
pronounced
attractiveness
of
form
and
feature
miss
graciella
treadwell
possessed
a
fine
complexion
a
clear
eye
and
an
elastic
spirit
she
was
also
well
endowed
with
certain
other
characteristics
of
youth
among
them
ingenuousness
which
if
it
be
a
fault
experience
is
sure
to
correct
and
impulsiveness
which
even
the
school
of
hard
knocks
is
not
always
able
to
eradicate
though
it
may
chasten
to
the
good
points
of
graciella
could
be
added
an
untroubled
conscience
at
least
up
to
that
period
when
colonel
french
dawned
upon
her
horizon
and
for
some
time
thereafter
if
she
had
put
herself
foremost
in
all
her
thoughts
it
had
been
the
unconscious
egotism
of
youth
with
no
definite
purpose
of
the
things
for
which
she
wished
most
were
associated
with
distant
places
and
her
longing
for
them
had
never
taken
the
form
of
envy
of
those
around
her
indeed
envy
is
scarcely
a
vice
of
youth
it
is
a
weed
that
flourishes
best
after
the
flower
of
hope
has
begun
to
wither
graciella
views
of
life
even
her
youthful
romanticism
were
sane
and
healthful
but
since
she
had
not
been
tried
in
the
furnace
of
experience
it
could
only
be
said
of
her
that
she
belonged
to
the
class
always
large
but
shifting
like
the
sands
of
the
sea
who
have
never
been
tempted
and
therefore
do
not
know
whether
they
would
sin
or
not
it
was
inevitable
with
such
a
nature
as
graciella
in
such
an
embodiment
that
the
time
should
come
at
some
important
crisis
of
her
life
when
she
must
choose
between
different
courses
nor
was
it
likely
that
she
could
avoid
what
comes
sometime
to
all
of
us
the
necessity
of
choosing
between
good
and
evil
her
liking
for
colonel
french
had
grown
since
their
first
meeting
he
knew
so
many
things
that
graciella
wished
to
know
that
when
he
came
to
the
house
she
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
conversation
with
him
her
aunt
laura
was
often
busy
with
household
duties
and
graciella
as
the
least
employed
member
of
the
family
was
able
to
devote
herself
to
his
entertainment
colonel
french
a
comparatively
idle
man
at
this
period
found
her
prattle
very
amusing
it
was
not
unnatural
for
graciella
to
think
that
this
acquaintance
might
be
of
future
value
she
could
scarcely
have
thought
otherwise
if
she
should
ever
go
to
new
york
a
rich
and
powerful
friend
would
be
well
worth
having
should
her
going
there
be
delayed
very
long
she
would
nevertheless
have
a
tie
of
friendship
in
the
great
city
and
a
source
to
which
she
might
at
any
time
apply
for
information
her
fondness
for
colonel
french
society
was
however
up
to
a
certain
time
entirely
spontaneous
and
coloured
by
no
ulterior
purpose
her
hope
that
his
friendship
might
prove
valuable
was
an
afterthought
it
was
during
this
happy
period
that
she
was
standing
one
day
by
the
garden
gate
when
colonel
french
passed
by
in
his
fine
new
trap
driving
a
spirited
horse
and
it
was
with
perfect
candour
that
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
familiarly
would
you
like
a
drive
he
called
would
i
she
replied
wait
till
i
tell
the
folks
she
was
back
in
a
moment
and
ran
out
of
the
gate
and
down
the
steps
the
colonel
gave
her
his
hand
and
she
sprang
up
beside
him
they
drove
through
the
cemetery
and
into
the
outlying
part
of
the
town
where
there
were
some
shaded
woodland
stretches
it
was
a
pleasant
afternoon
cloudy
enough
to
hide
the
sun
graciella
eyes
sparkled
and
her
cheek
glowed
with
pleasure
while
her
light
brown
hair
blown
about
her
face
by
the
breeze
of
their
rapid
motion
was
like
an
aureole
colonel
french
she
said
as
they
were
walking
the
horse
up
a
hill
are
you
going
to
give
a
house
warming
why
he
said
i
had
thought
of
it
ought
i
to
give
a
house
warming
you
surely
ought
everybody
will
want
to
see
your
house
while
it
is
new
and
bright
you
certainly
ought
to
have
a
house
warming
very
well
said
the
colonel
i
make
it
a
rule
to
shirk
no
plain
duty
if
i
to
have
a
house
warming
i
have
it
and
you
shall
be
my
social
mentor
what
sort
of
a
party
shall
it
be
why
not
make
it
she
said
brightly
just
such
a
party
as
your
father
would
have
had
you
have
the
old
house
and
the
old
furniture
give
an
party
in
fitting
up
his
house
the
colonel
had
been
animated
by
the
same
feeling
that
had
moved
him
to
its
purchase
he
had
endeavoured
to
restore
as
far
as
possible
the
interior
as
he
remembered
it
in
his
childhood
at
his
father
death
the
furniture
had
been
sold
and
scattered
he
had
been
able
through
the
kindly
interest
of
his
friends
to
recover
several
of
the
pieces
others
that
were
lost
past
hope
had
been
reproduced
from
their
description
among
those
recovered
was
a
fine
pair
of
brass
andirons
and
his
mahogany
desk
which
had
been
purchased
by
major
treadwell
at
the
sale
of
the
elder
french
effects
miss
laura
had
been
the
first
to
speak
of
the
desk
henry
she
had
said
the
house
would
not
be
complete
without
your
father
desk
it
was
my
father
too
but
yours
is
the
prior
claim
take
it
as
a
gift
from
me
he
protested
and
would
have
paid
for
it
liberally
and
when
she
would
take
nothing
declared
he
would
not
accept
it
on
such
terms
you
are
selfish
henry
she
replied
with
a
smile
you
have
brought
a
new
interest
into
our
lives
and
into
the
town
and
you
will
not
let
us
make
you
any
return
but
i
am
taking
from
you
something
you
need
he
replied
and
for
which
you
paid
when
major
treadwell
bought
it
it
was
merely
furniture
sold
under
the
hammer
now
it
has
the
value
of
an
antique
it
is
a
fine
piece
and
could
be
sold
in
new
york
for
a
large
sum
you
must
take
it
for
nothing
or
not
at
all
she
replied
firmly
it
is
highway
robbery
he
said
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
yield
next
day
when
the
colonel
went
home
after
having
been
down
town
an
hour
he
found
the
desk
in
his
library
the
treadwell
ladies
had
corrupted
peter
who
had
told
them
when
the
colonel
would
be
out
of
the
house
and
had
brought
a
cart
to
take
the
desk
away
when
the
house
was
finished
the
interior
was
simple
but
beautiful
it
was
furnished
in
the
style
that
had
been
prevalent
fifty
years
before
there
were
some
modern
additions
in
the
line
of
comfort
and
luxury
soft
chairs
fine
rugs
and
a
few
choice
books
and
pictures
for
the
colonel
had
not
attempted
to
conform
his
own
tastes
and
habits
to
those
of
his
father
he
had
some
visitors
mostly
gentlemen
and
there
was
as
graciella
knew
a
lively
curiosity
among
the
ladies
to
see
the
house
and
its
contents
the
suggestion
of
a
house
warming
had
come
originally
from
treadwell
but
graciella
had
promptly
made
it
her
own
and
conveyed
it
to
the
colonel
a
bright
idea
he
replied
by
all
means
let
it
be
an
party
say
such
a
party
as
my
father
would
have
given
or
my
grandfather
and
shall
we
invite
the
old
people
well
replied
graciella
judicially
do
have
them
so
old
that
they
ca
talk
or
hear
and
must
be
fed
with
a
spoon
if
there
were
too
many
old
or
not
enough
young
people
i
should
enjoy
myself
i
suppose
i
seem
awfully
old
to
you
said
the
colonel
parenthetically
oh
i
do
know
replied
graciella
giving
him
a
frankly
critical
look
when
you
first
came
i
thought
you
rather
old
you
see
you
are
older
than
aunt
laura
but
you
seem
to
have
grown
younger
it
curious
but
it
true
and
now
i
hardly
think
of
you
as
old
at
all
the
colonel
was
secretly
flattered
the
wisest
man
over
forty
likes
to
be
thought
young
very
well
he
said
you
shall
select
the
guests
at
an
party
continued
graciella
thoughtfully
the
guests
should
wear
clothes
in
grandmother
time
the
ladies
wore
long
flowing
sleeves
and
hoopskirts
said
the
colonel
and
their
hair
down
over
their
ears
or
in
ringlets
yes
it
is
all
in
grandmother
bound
volume
of
ladies
said
graciella
i
was
reading
it
only
last
week
my
mother
took
it
returned
the
colonel
then
you
must
have
read
from
a
pastry
cook
by
willis
when
they
came
out
no
said
the
colonel
with
a
sigh
i
missed
that
i
i
was
able
to
read
then
graciella
indulged
in
a
brief
mental
calculation
why
of
course
not
she
laughed
you
were
even
born
when
they
came
out
but
they
fine
i
lend
you
our
copy
you
must
ask
all
the
girls
to
dress
as
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
used
to
dress
make
the
requirement
elastic
because
some
of
them
may
not
have
just
the
things
for
one
particular
period
i
all
right
we
have
a
cedar
chest
in
the
attic
full
of
old
things
wo
i
look
funny
in
a
hoop
skirt
you
look
charming
in
anything
said
the
colonel
it
was
a
pleasure
to
pay
graciella
compliments
she
so
frankly
enjoyed
them
and
the
colonel
loved
to
make
others
happy
in
his
new
york
firm
french
was
always
ready
to
consider
a
request
for
an
advance
of
salary
kirby
had
often
been
obliged
to
play
the
wicked
partner
in
order
to
keep
expenses
down
to
a
normal
level
at
parties
débutantes
had
always
expected
french
to
say
something
pleasant
to
them
and
had
rarely
been
disappointed
the
subject
of
the
party
was
resumed
next
day
at
treadwell
where
the
colonel
went
in
the
afternoon
to
call
an
party
declared
the
colonel
should
have
amusements
we
must
have
a
fiddler
a
black
fiddler
to
play
quadrilles
and
the
virginia
reel
i
do
know
where
you
find
one
said
miss
laura
i
ask
peter
replied
the
colonel
he
ought
to
know
peter
was
in
the
yard
with
phil
lawd
mars
henry
said
peter
fiddlers
is
mighty
dese
days
but
i
reckon
ole
campbell
kin
make
you
shake
yo
feet
yit
ef
ole
man
rheumatiz
ain
ketched
holt
er
too
tight
and
i
will
play
a
minuet
on
your
new
piano
said
miss
laura
and
teach
the
girls
beforehand
how
to
dance
it
there
should
be
cards
for
those
who
do
not
dance
so
the
party
was
arranged
miss
laura
graciella
and
the
colonel
made
out
the
list
of
guests
the
invitations
were
duly
sent
out
for
an
party
with
costumes
any
period
between
and
permissible
and
entertainment
the
announcement
created
some
excitement
in
social
circles
and

stretched
behind

and
unpleasant
dream

came
off
at
the
appointed
time
and
was
a
distinct
success

had
made
a
raid
on
the
cedar
chest
and
shone
resplendent
in
crinoline
curls
and
a
patterned
muslin
together
with

wore
a
suit
of

which
the
care
of
old
aunt

had
preserved
wonderfully
well
from

through

full

rallied
from

begged

whom
peter
had
resurrected
from
some
obscure
cabin
oiled
his
rheumatic

his
fiddle
and
rosined
his
bow
and
under
the
inspiration
of
good
food

played

whole
repertory

included
such
ancient
favourites
as

played
a
minuet
which
the
young

danced

danced

and
some
of
the

sang
songs
and

in

and
made
much
of
for
several
hours
until
he
became
sleepy
and
was
put
to
bed
graciella
said
the
colonel
to
his
young
friend
during
the
evening
our
party
is
a
great
success
it
was
your
idea
when
it
is
all
over
i
want
to
make
you
a
present
in
token
of
my
gratitude
you
shall
select
it
yourself
it
shall
be
whatever
you
say
graciella
was
very
much
elated
at
this
mark
of
the
friendship
she
did
not
dream
of
declining
the
proffered
token
and
during
the
next
dance
her
mind
was
busily
occupied
with
the
question
of
what
it
should
be
a
ring
a
bracelet
a
bicycle
a
set
of
books
she
needed
a
dozen
things
and
would
have
liked
to
possess
a
dozen
others
she
had
not
yet
decided
when
ben
came
up
to
claim
her
for
a
dance
on
his
appearance
she
was
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
colonel
french
was
a
man
of
affairs
in
new
york
he
must
have
a
wide
circle
of
influential
acquaintances
old
dudley
was
in
failing
health
he
might
die
at
any
time
and
ben
would
then
be
free
to
seek
employment
away
from
clarendon
what
better
place
for
him
than
new
york
with
a
position
there
he
would
be
able
to
marry
her
and
take
her
there
to
live
this
she
decided
should
be
her
request
of
the
colonel
that
he
should
help
her
lover
to
a
place
in
new
york
her
conclusion
was
really
magnanimous
she
might
profit
by
it
in
the
end
but
ben
would
be
the
first
beneficiary
it
was
an
act
of
for
she
was
giving
up
a
definite
and
certain
good
for
a
future
contingency
she
was
therefore
in
a
pleasant
glow
of
mood
when
she
accidentally
overheard
a
conversation
not
intended
for
her
ears
she
had
run
out
to
the
to
speak
to
the
housekeeper
about
the
refreshments
and
was
returning
through
the
hall
when
she
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
into
the
library
where
those
who
did
not
care
to
dance
were
playing
cards
beyond
the
door
with
their
backs
turned
toward
her
sat
two
ladies
engaged
in
conversation
one
was
a
widow
a
gossip
and
the
other
a
wife
known
to
be
unhappily
married
they
were
no
longer
young
and
their
views
were
marked
by
the
cynicism
of
seasoned
experience
oh
there
no
doubt
about
it
said
the
widow
he
came
down
here
to
find
a
wife
he
tried
a
yankee
wife
and
did
like
the
breed
and
when
he
was
ready
for
number
two
he
came
back
south
he
showed
good
taste
said
the
other
that
depends
said
the
widow
upon
whom
he
chooses
he
can
probably
have
his
pick
no
doubt
rejoined
the
married
lady
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
which
the
widow
who
was
still
under
forty
chose
to
ignore
i
wonder
which
is
it
said
the
widow
i
suppose
it
laura
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
there
and
she
devoted
to
his
little
boy
or
pretends
to
be
do
fool
yourself
replied
the
other
earnestly
and
not
without
a
subdued
pleasure
in
disabusing
the
widow
mind
do
fool
yourself
my
dear
a
man
of
his
age
does
marry
a
woman
of
laura
treadwell
believe
me
it
the
little
one
but
she
has
a
beau
there
that
tall
nephew
of
old
dudley
he
been
hanging
around
her
for
a
year
or
two
he
looks
very
handsome
ah
well
she
dispose
of
him
fast
enough
when
the
time
comes
only
a
poor
stick
the
last
of
a
good
stock
run
to
seed
why
been
pointedly
setting
her
cap
at
the
colonel
all
the
evening
perfectly
infatuated
he
has
danced
with
her
three
times
to
once
with
laura
it
sad
to
see
a
man
make
a
fool
of
himself
sighed
the
widow
who
was
not
without
some
remnants
of
beauty
and
a
heart
still
warm
and
willing
children
are
very
forward
nowadays
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
my
dear
replied
the
other
with
the
cheerful
philosophy
of
the
miserable
who
love
company
these
fair
women
are
always
selfish
and
calculating
and
she
a
bold
piece
my
husband
says
colonel
french
is
worth
at
least
a
million
a
young
wife
who
understands
her
business
could
get
anything
from
him
that
money
can
buy
what
a
pity
my
dear
said
the
widow
with
a
spice
of
malice
seeing
her
own
opportunity
what
a
pity
that
you
were
older
than
your
husband
well
it
will
be
fortunate
for
the
child
if
she
marries
an
old
man
for
beauty
of
her
type

zest
into

occasion
participated
in
the

graciella
touched
his
hand
it
was
with
the
consciousness
of
a
new
element
in
their
relations
until
then
her
friendship
for
colonel
french
had
been
perfectly
ingenuous
she
had
liked
him
because
he
was
interesting
and
good
to
her
in
a
friendly
way
now
she
realised
that
he
was
a
millionaire
eligible
for
marriage

if
she
understood
her

might
secure

party
broke
up
the
colonel
was
congratulated
on
every
hand
he
had
not
only
given
his
guests
a
delightful
evening
he
had
restored
an
ancient
landmark
had
recalled
to
a
people
whose
life
lay
mostly
in
the
past
the
glory
of
days
gone
by
and
proved
his
loyalty
to
their
cherished
traditions
ben
dudley
walked
home
with
graciella
miss

went
ahead
of
them
with
catherine

was
cheerful
in
the
possession
of
a
substantial
reward
for
her
services

to
his
sweetheart
as
they
walked
along

graciella
did
not
respond
you
not

he
repeated
yes
returned
graciella
abstractedly
it
was
a
lovely
party
ben
said
no
more
the

warming
had
also
given
him
food
for

he
had
noticed
the

to

and
had
heard
them
remarked
upon

was
more
than
old
enough
to
be
graciella
father
but
he
was
rich
graciella

poor
and

assets
were

and
hope

field

only
claim
miss
laura
and
catherine
had
gone
in
and
when
the
young
people
came
to
the
gate
the
light
still
shone
through
the
open
door
graciella
he
said
taking
her
hand
in
his
as
they
stood
a
moment
will
you
marry
me
still
harping
on
the
same
old
string
she
said
withdrawing
her
hand
i
tired
now
ben
too
tired
to
talk
foolishness
very
well
i
save
it
for
next
time
good
night
sweetheart
she
had
closed
the
gate
between
them
he
leaned
over
it
to
kiss
her
but
she
evaded
his
caress
and
ran
lightly
up
the
steps
good
night
ben
she
called
good
night
sweetheart
he
replied
with
a
pang
of
foreboding
in
after
years
when
the
colonel
looked
back
upon
his
residence
in
clarendon
this
seemed
to
him
the
golden
moment
there
were
other
times
that
stirred
deeper
emotions
the
lust
of
battle
the
joy
of
victory
the
chagrin
of
defeat
moments
that
tried
his
soul
with
tests
almost
too
hard
but
thus
far
his
new
career
in
clarendon
had
been
one
of
pleasant
experiences
only
and
this
unclouded
hour
was
its
fitting
crown
whenever
the
colonel
visited
the
cemetery
or
took
a
walk
in
that
pleasant
quarter
of
the
town
he
had
to
cross
the
bridge
from
which
was
visible
the
site
of
the
old
eureka
cotton
mill
of
his
boyhood
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
recall
that
it
had
been
before
the
war
a
busy
hive
of
industry
on
a
narrow
and
obscure
street
little
more
than
an
alley
behind
the
cemetery
there
were
still
several
crumbling
tenements
built
for
the
mill
operatives
but
now
occupied
by
a
handful
of
abjectly
poor
whites
who
kept
body
and
soul
together
through
the
doubtful
mercy
of
god
and
a
small
weekly
dole
from
the
poormaster
the
mill
pond
while
not
had
extended
back
some
distance
between
the
sloping
banks
and
had
furnished
swimming
holes
fishing
holes
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
at
present
a
very
fine
head
of
water
which
as
it
struck
the
colonel
more
forcibly
each
time
he
saw
it
offered
an
opportunity
that
the
town
could
ill
afford
to
waste
shrewd
minds
in
the
cotton
industry
had
long
ago
conceived
the
idea
that
the
south
by
reason
of
its
nearness
to
the
source
of
raw
material
its
abundant
water
power
and
its
cheaper
labour
partly
due
to
the
smaller
cost
of
living
in
a
mild
climate
and
the
absence
of
labour
agitation
was
destined
in
time
to
rival
and
perhaps
displace
new
england
in
cotton
manufacturing
many
southern
mills
were
already
in
successful
operation
but
from
lack
of
capital
or
lack
of
enterprise
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
been
undertaken
in
clarendon
although
the
town
was
the
centre
of
a
district
and
there
was
a
mill
in
an
adjoining
county
men
who
owned
land
mortgaged
it
for
money
to
raise
cotton
men
who
rented
land
from
others
mortgaged
their
crops
for
the
same
purpose
it
was
easy
to
borrow
money
in
clarendon
on
adequate
security
at
ten
per
and
fetters
the
magnate
of
the
county
was
always
ready
the
colonel
had
learned
to
accommodate
the
needy
who
could
give
such
security
he
had
also
discovered
that
fetters
was
acquiring
the
greater
part
of
the
land
many
a
farmer
imagined
that
he
owned
a
farm
when
he
was
actually
merely
a
tenant
of
fetters
occasionally
fetters
foreclosed
a
mortgage
when
there
was
plainly
no
more
to
be
had
from
it
and
bought
in
the
land
which
he
added
to
his
own
holdings
in
fee
but
as
a
rule
he
found
it
more
profitable
to
let
the
borrower
retain
possession
and
pay
the
interest
as
nearly
as
he
could
the
estate
would
ultimately
be
good
for
the
debt
if
the
debtor
did
not
live
too
long
worry
might
be
counted
upon
to
shorten
his
days
and
the
loan
with
interest
could
be
more
conveniently
collected
at
his
death
to
bankrupt
an
estate
was
less
personal
than
to
break
an
individual
and
widows
and
orphans
still
in
their
minority
did
not
vote
and
knew
little
about
business
methods
to
a
man
of
action
like
the
colonel
the
frequent
contemplation
of
the
unused
water
power
which
might
so
easily
be
harnessed
to
the
car
of
progress
gave
birth
in
time
to
a
wish
to
see
it
thus
utilised
and
the
further
wish
to
stir
to
labour
the
idle
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
in
all
work
the
shiftless
methods
of
an
older
generation
still
survived
no
one
could
do
anything
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
nearly
all
tasks
were
done
by
negroes
who
had
forgotten
how
to
work
or
by
white
people
who
had
never
learned
but
the
colonel
had
already
seen
the
reviving
effect
of
a
little
money
directed
by
a
little
energy
and
so
he
planned
to
build
a
new
and
larger
cotton
mill
where
the
old
had
stood
to
shake
up
this
lethargic
community
to
put
its
people
to
work
and
to
teach
them
habits
of
industry
efficiency
and
thrift
this
he
imagined
would
be
pleasant
occupation
for
his
vacation
as
well
as
a
true
missionary
enterprise
a
contribution
to
human
progress
such
a
cotton
mill
would
require
only
an
inconsiderable
portion
of
his
capital
the
body
of
which
would
be
left
intact
for
investment
elsewhere
it
would
not
interfere
at
all
with
his
freedom
of
movement
for
once
built
equipped
and
put
in
operation
under
a
competent
manager
it
would
no
more
require
his
personal
oversight
than
had
the
new
england
bagging
mills
which
his
firm
had
conducted
for
so
many
years
from
impulse
to
action
was
for
the
colonel
temperament
an
easy
step
and
he
had
scarcely
moved
into
his
house
before
he
quietly
set
about
investigating
the
title
to
the
old
mill
site
it
had
been
forfeited
many
years
before
he
found
to
the
state
for
of
taxes
there
having
been
no
demand
for
the
property
at
any
time
since
it
had
never
been
sold
but
held
as
a
sort
of
lapsed
asset
subject
to
sale
but
open
also
so
long
as
it
remained
unsold
to
redemption
upon
the
payment
of
back
taxes
and
certain
fees
the
amount
of
these
was
ascertained
it
was
considerably
less
than
the
fair
value
of
the
property
which
was
therefore
redeemable
at
a
profit
the
owners
however
were
widely
scattered
for
the
mill
had
belonged
to
a
company
composed
of
a
dozen
or
more
members
colonel
french
was
pleasantly
surprised
upon
looking
up
certain
musty
public
records
in
the
court
house
to
find
that
he
himself
was
the
owner
by
inheritance
of
several
shares
of
stock
which
had
been
overlooked
in
the
sale
of
his
father
property
retaining
the
services
of
judge
bullard
the
leading
member
of
the
clarendon
bar
he
set
out
quietly
to
secure
options
upon
the
other
shares
this
involved
an
extensive
correspondence
which
occupied
several
weeks
for
it
was
necessary
first
to
find
and
then
to
deal
with
the
scattered
representatives
of
the
former
owners
in
engaging
judge
bullard
the
colonel
had
merely
stated
to
the
lawyer
that
he
thought
of
building
a
but
had
said
nothing
about
his
broader
plan
it
was
very
likely
he
recognised
that
the
people
of
clarendon
might
not
relish
the
thought
that
they
were
regarded
as
fit
subjects
for
reform
he
knew
that
they
were
sensitive
and
quick
to
resent
criticism
if
some
of
them
might
admit
now
and
then
among
themselves
that
the
town
was
unprogressive
or
declining
there
was
always
some
extraneous
reason
given
the
war
the
carpetbaggers
the
fifteenth
amendment
the
negroes
perhaps
not
one
of
them
had
ever
quite
realised
the
awful
handicap
of
excuses
under
which
they
laboured
effort
was
paralysed
where
failure
was
so
easily
explained
that
the
condition
of
the
town
might
be
due
to
causes
within
itself
to
the
general
ignorance
and
lack
of
enterprise
had
occurred
to
only
a
favoured
few
the
younger
of
these
had
moved
away
seeking
a
broader
outlook
elsewhere
while
those
who
remained
were
not
yet
strong
enough
nor
brave
enough
to
break
with
the
past
and
urge
new
standards
of
thought
and
feeling
so
the
colonel
kept
his
larger
purpose
to
himself
until
a
time
when
greater
openness
would
serve
to
advance
it
thus
judge
bullard
not
being
able
to
read
his
client
mind
assumed
very
naturally
that
the
contemplated
enterprise
was
to
be
of
a
purely
commercial
nature
directed
to
making
the
most
money
in
the
shortest
time
some
day
colonel
he
said
with
this
thought
in
mind
you
might
get
a
few
pointers
by
running
over
to
carthage
and
looking
through
the
excelsior
mills
they
get
more
work
there
for
less
money
than
anywhere
else
in
the
south
last
year
they
declared
a
forty
per
cent
dividend
i
know
the
superintendent
and
will
give
you
a
letter
of
introduction
whenever
you
like
the
colonel
bore
the
matter
in
mind
and
one
morning
a
day
or
two
after
his
party
set
out
by
train
about
eight
in
the
morning
for
carthage
armed
with
a
letter
from
the
lawyer
to
the
superintendent
of
the
mills
the
town
was
only
forty
miles
away
but
a
cow
had
been
caught
in
a
trestle
across
a
ditch
and
some
time
was
required
for
the
train
crew
to
release
her
another
stop
was
made
in
the
middle
of
a
swamp
to
put
off
a
light
mulatto
who
had
presumed
on
his
complexion
to
ride
in
the
white
people
car
he
had
been
successfully
spotted
but
had
impudently
refused
to
go
into
the
stuffy
little
closet
provided
at
the
end
of
the
car
for
people
of
his
class
he
was
therefore
given
an
opportunity
to
reflect
during
a
walk
along
the
ties
upon
his
true
relation
to
society
another
stop
was
made
for
a
gentleman
who
had
sent
a
negro
boy
ahead
to
flag
the
train
and
notify
the
conductor
that
he
would
be
along
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
with
a
couple
of
lady
passengers
a
hot
journal
caused
a
further
delay
these
interruptions
made
it
eleven
a
run
before
the
train
reached
carthage
the
town
was
much
smaller
than
clarendon
it
comprised
a
public
square
of
several
acres
in
extent
on
one
side
of
which
was
the
railroad
station
and
on
another
the
court
house
one
of
the
remaining
sides
was
occupied
by
a
row
of
shops
the
fourth
straggled
off
in
various
directions
the
whole
wore
a
neglected
air
bales
of
cotton
goods
were
piled
on
the
platform
apparently
just
unloaded
from
wagons
standing
near
several
white
men
and
negroes
stood
around
and
stared
listlessly
at
the
train
and
the
few
who
alighted
from
it
inquiring
its
whereabouts
from
one
of
the
bystanders
the
colonel
found
the
nearest
hotel
a
frame
structure
with
a
piazza
across
the
front
extending
to
the
street
line
there
was
a
buggy
standing
in
front
its
horse
hitched
to
one
of
the
piazza
posts
steps
led
up
from
the
street
but
one
might
step
from
the
buggy
to
the
floor
of
the
piazza
which
was
without
a
railing
the
colonel
mounted
the
steps
and
passed
through
the
door
into
a
small
room
which
he
took
for
the
hotel
office
since
there
were
chairs
standing
against
the
walls
and
at
one
side
a
table
on
which
a
register
lay
open
the
only
person
in
the
room
beside
himself
was
a
young
man
seated
near
the
door
with
his
feet
elevated
to
the
back
of
another
chair
reading
a
newspaper
from
which
he
did
not
look
up
the
colonel
who
wished
to
make
some
inquiries
and
to
register
for
the
dinner
which
he
might
return
to
take
looked
around
him
for
the
clerk
or
some
one
in
authority
but
no
one
was
visible
while
waiting
he
walked
over
to
the
desk
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
register
he
recognised
only
one
name
that
of
william
fetters
who
had
registered
there
only
a
day
or
two
before
no
one
had
yet
appeared
the
young
man
in
the
chair
was
evidently
not
connected
with
the
establishment
his
expression
was
so
forbidding
not
to
say
arrogant
and
his
absorption
in
the
newspaper
so
complete
that
the
colonel
not
caring
to
address
him
turned
to
the
right
and
crossed
a
narrow
hall
to
a
room
beyond
evidently
a
parlour
since
it
was
fitted
up
with
a
faded
ingrain
carpet
a
centre
table
with
a
red
plush
photograph
album
and
several
enlarged
crayon
portraits
hung
near
the
ceiling
of
the
kind
made
free
of
charge
in
chicago
from
photographs
provided
the
owner
orders
a
frame
from
the
company
no
one
was
in
the
room
and
the
colonel
had
turned
to
leave
it
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
a
lady
passing
through
the
hall
are
you
looking
for
some
one
she
asked
amiably
having
noted
his
air
of
inquiry
why
yes
madam
replied
the
colonel
removing
his
hat
i
was
looking
for
the
proprietor
or
the
clerk
why
she
replied
smiling
that
the
proprietor
sitting
there
in
the
office
i
going
in
to
speak
to
him
and
you
can
get
his
attention
at
the
same
time
their
entrance
did
not
disturb
the
young
man
reposeful
attitude
which
remained
as
unchanged
as
that
of
a
graven
image
nor
did
he
exhibit
any
consciousness
at
their
presence
i
want
a
clean
towel
dickson
said
the
lady
sharply
the
proprietor
looked
up
with
an
annoyed
expression
huh
he
demanded
in
a
tone
of
resentment
mingled
with
surprise
a
clean
towel
if
you
please
the
proprietor
said
nothing
more
to
the
lady
nor
deigned
to
notice
the
colonel
at
all
but
lifted
his
legs
down
from
the
back
of
the
chair
rose
with
a
sigh
left
the
room
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
towel
which
he
handed
ungraciously
to
the
lady
then
still
paying
no
attention
to
the
colonel
he
resumed
his
former
attitude
and
returned
to
the
perusal
of
his
newspaper
certainly
the
most
unconcerned
of
hotel
keepers
thought
the
colonel
as
a
vision
of
spacious
lobbies
liveried
porters
and
obsequious
clerks
rose
before
his
vision
he
made
no
audible
comment
however
but
merely
stared
at
the
young
man
curiously
left
the
hotel
and
inquired
of
a
passing
negro
the
whereabouts
of
the
livery
stable
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
the
place
without
difficulty
and
hired
a
horse
and
buggy
while
the
stable
boy
was
putting
the
harness
on
the
horse
the
colonel
related
to
the
liveryman
whose
manner
was
energetic
and
and
who
possessed
an
open
countenance
and
a
sympathetic
eye
his
experience
at
the
hotel
oh
yes
was
the
reply
that
lee
dickson
all
over
that
hotel
used
to
be

the
cake
however
money

our
pocket
as
long
as
it
keeps
up
i
should
think
it
would
keep
up
long
returned
the
colonel
how
can
such
a
hotel
prosper
it
do
replied
the
liveryman
but
it
the
best
in
town
i
do
see
how
there
could
be
a
worse
said
the
colonel
there
could
it
reached
bed
rock
the
buggy
was
ready
by
this
time
and
the
colonel
set
out
with
a
black
driver
to
find
the
excelsior
cotton
mills
they
proved
to
be
situated
in
a
desolate
sandhill
region
several
miles
out
of
town
the
day
was
hot
the
weather
had
been
dry
and
the
road
was
deep
with
a
yielding
white
sand
into
which
the
buggy
tires
sank
the
horse
soon
panted
with
the
heat
and
the
exertion
and
the
colonel
dressed
in
brown
linen
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
the
driver
a
taciturn
negro
most
of
the
loquacious
negroes
of
the
colonel
youth
seemed
to
have
disappeared
flicked
a
horsefly
now
and
then
with
his
whip
from
the
horse
sweating
back
the
first
sign
of
the
mill
was
a
straggling
group
of
small
frame
houses
built
of
unpainted
pine
lumber
the
barren
soil
which
would
not
have
supported
a
firm
lawn
was
dotted
with
scraggy
bunches
of
wiregrass
in
the
open
doorways
through
which
the
flies
swarmed
in
and
out
grown
men
some
old
some
still
in
the
prime
of
life
were
lounging
pipe
in
mouth
while
old
women
pottered
about
the
yards
or
pushed
back
their
sunbonnets
to
stare
vacantly
at
the
advancing
buggy
dirty
babies
were
tumbling
about
the
cabins
there
was
a
lean
and
listless
yellow
dog
or
two
for
every
baby
and
several
slatternly
black
women
were
washing
clothes
on
the
shady
sides
of
the
houses
a
general
air
of
shiftlessness
and
squalor
pervaded
the
settlement
there
was
no
sign
of
joyous
childhood
or
of
happy
youth
a
turn
in
the
road
brought
them
to
the
mill
the
distant
hum
of
which
had
already
been
audible
it
was
a
brick
structure
with
many
windows
altogether
of
the
cheapest
construction
but
situated
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
and
backed
by
a
noble
water
power
they
drew
up
before
an
open
door
at
one
corner
of
the
building
the
colonel
alighted
entered
and
presented
his
letter
of
introduction
the
superintendent
glanced
at
him
keenly
but
after
reading
the
letter
greeted
him
with
a
show
of
cordiality
and
called
a
young
man
to
conduct
the
visitor
through
the
mill
the
guide
seemed
in
somewhat
of
a
hurry
and
reticent
of
speech
nor
was
the
noise
of
the
machinery
conducive
to
conversation
some
of
the
colonel
questions
seemed
unheard
and
others
were
imperfectly
answered
yet
the
conditions
disclosed
by
even
such
an
inspection
were
to
the
colonel
a
revelation
through
air
thick
with
flying
particles
of
cotton
pale
anæmic
young
women
glanced
at
him
curiously
with
eyes
or
eyes
in
which
the
gleam
was
not
that
of
health
or
hope
or
holiness
wizened
children
who
had
never
known
the
joys
of
childhood
worked
side
by
side
at
long
rows
of
spools
to
which
they
must
give
unremitting
attention
most
of
the
women
were
using
snuff
the
odour
of
which
was
mingled
with
the
flying
particles
of
cotton
while
the
floor
was
thickly
covered
with
unsightly
brown
splotches
when
they
had
completed
the
tour
of
the
mills
and
returned
to
the
office
the
colonel
asked
some
questions
of
the
manager
about
the
equipment
the
output
and
the
market
which
were
very
promptly
and
courteously
answered
to
those
concerning
hours
and
wages
the
replies
were
less
definite
and
the
colonel
went
away
impressed
as
much
by
what
he
had
not
learned
as
by
what
he
had
seen
while
settling
his
bill
at
the
livery
stable
he
made
further
inquiries
lord
yes
said
the
liveryman
in
answer
to
one
of
them
i
can
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
about
that
mill
talk
about
nigger
slavery
the
niggers
never
were
worked
like
white
women
and
children
are
in
them
mills
they
work
from
twelve
to
sixteen
hours
a
day
for
from
fifteen
to
fifty
cents
them
triflin
old
pinelanders
out
there
jus
lay
aroun
and
raise
children
for
the
mills
and
then
set
down
and
chaw
tobacco
an
live
on
their
children
wages
it
a
sin
an
a
shame
an
there
ought
to
be
a
law
it
the
conversation
brought
out
the
further
fact
that
vice
was
rampant
among
the
millhands
an
it
ai
surprisin
said
the
liveryman
with
indignation
tempered
by
the
easy
philosophy
of
hot
climates
shut
up
in
jail
all
day
an
half
the
night
never
breathin
the
pyo
air
or
baskin
in
god
bright
sunshine
with
no
books
to
read
an
no
chance
to
learn
who
can
blame
the
things
if
they
have
a
little
joy
in
the
only
way
they
know
who
owns
the
mill
asked
the
colonel
it
belongs
to
a
company
was
the
reply
but
old
bill
fetters
owns
a
majority
of
the
stock
durn
him
the
colonel
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
he
had
met
a
man
after
his
own
heart
you
are
not
one
of
fetters
admirers
then
he
asked
not
by
a
durn
sight
returned
the
liveryman
promptly
when
i
look
at
them
white
gals
that
ought
to
be
an
plump
an
hearty
an
happy
an
them
po
little
that
never
get
a
chance
to
go
fishin
or
swimmin
or
to
learn
anything
i
allow
i
wouldn
mind
if
the
durned
old
mill
would
catch
fire
an
burn
down
they
work
children
there
from
six
years
old
up
an
half
of
die
of
consumption
before
they
grown
it
a
durned
outrage
an
if
i
ever
go
to
the
legislatur
for
which
i
mean
to
run
i
try
to
have
it
stopped
i
hope
you
will
be
elected
said
the
colonel
what
time
does
the
train
go
back
to
clarendon
four
if
she
on
time
but
it
may
be
five
do
you
suppose
i
can
get
dinner
at
the
hotel
oh
yes
i
sent
word
up
that
i
you
might
be
back
so
be
expectin
you
the
proprietor
was
at
the
desk
when
the
colonel
went
in
he
wrote
his
name
on
the
book
and
was
served
with
an
execrable
dinner
he
paid
his
bill
of
half
a
dollar
to
the
taciturn
proprietor
and
sat
down
on
the
shady
porch
to
smoke
a
cigar
the
proprietor
having
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
came
out
and
stepped
into
his
buggy
which
was
still
standing
alongside
the
piazza
the
colonel
watched
him
drive
a
throw
to
a
barroom
down
the
street
get
down
go
in
come
out
a
few
minutes
later
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
climb
into
the
buggy
drive
back
step
out
and
the
hotel
it
was
yet
an
hour
to
train
time
and
the
colonel
to
satisfy
an
impulse
of
curiosity
strolled
over
to
the
court
house
which
could
be
seen
across
the
square
through
the
trees
requesting
leave
of
the
clerk
in
the
county
recorder
office
to
look
at
the
records
of
mortgages
he
turned
the
leaves
over
and
found
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
mortgages
recently
recorded
among
them
one
on
the
hotel
property
had
been
given
to
fetters
the
whistle
of
the
train
was
heard
in
the
distance
as
the
colonel
recrossed
the
square
glancing
toward
the
hotel
he
saw
the
landlord
come
out
drive
across
the
square
to
the
station
and
sit
there
until
the
passengers
had
alighted
to
a
drummer
with
a
sample
case
he
pointed
carelessly
across
the
square
to
the
hotel
but
made
no
movement
to
take
the
baggage
and
as
the
train
moved
off
the
colonel
looking
back
saw
him
driving
back
to
the
hotel
fetters
had
begun
to
worry
the
colonel
he
had
never
seen
the
man
and
yet
his
influence
was
everywhere
he
seemed
to
brood
over
the
country
round
about
like
a
great
vampire
bat
sucking
the
of
the
people
his
touch
meant
blight
as
soon
as
a
fetters
mortgage
rested
on
a
place
the
property
began
to
run
down
for
why
should
the
nominal
owner
keep
up
a
place
which
was
destined
in
the
end
to
go
to
fetters
the
colonel
had
heard
grewsome
tales
of
fetters
convict
labour
plantation
he
had
seen
the
operation
of
fetters
where
white
humanity
in
its
fairest
and
tenderest
form
was
stunted
and
blighted
and
destroyed
and
he
had
not
forgotten
the
scene
in
the
justice
office
the
fighting
blood
of
the
old
frenches
was
stirred
the
means
were
abundant
he
did
not
lack
the
sinews
of
war
clarendon
offered
a
field
for
profitable
investment
he
would
like
to
do
something
for
humanity
something
to
offset
fetters
and
his
kind
who
were
preying
upon
the
weaknesses
of
the
people
enslaving
white
and
black
alike
in
a
great
city
what
he
could
give
away
would
have
been
but
a
slender
stream
scarcely
felt
in
the
rivers
of
charity
poured
into
the
ocean
of
want
and
even
his
considerable
wealth
would
have
made
him
only
a
small
stockholder
in
some
great
aggregation
of
capital
in
this
backward
old
town
away
from
the
great
centres
of
commerce
and
scarcely
feeling
their
distant
pulsebeat
except
when
some
daring
speculator
tried
for
a
brief
period
to
corner
the
cotton
market
he
could
mark
with
his
own
eyes
the
good
he
might
accomplish
it
required
no
great
stretch
of
imagination
to
see
the
town
a
few
years
hence
a
busy
hive
of
industry
where
no
man
and
no
woman
obliged
to
work
need
be
without
employment
at
fair
wages
where
the
trinity
of
peace
prosperity
and
progress
would
reign
supreme
where
men
like
fetters
and
methods
like
his
would
no
longer
be
tolerated
the
forces
of
enlightenment
set
in
motion
by
his
aid
and
supported
by
just
laws
should
engage
the
retrograde
forces
represented
by
fetters
communities
like
men
must
either
grow
or
decay
advance
or
decline
they
could
not
stand
still
clarendon
was
decaying
fetters
was
the
parasite
which
by
sending
out
its
roots
toward
rich
and
poor
alike
struck
at
both
extremes
of
society
and
was
choking
the
life
of
the
town
like
a
rank
and
deadly
vine
the
colonel
could
if
need
be
spare
the
year
or
two
of
continuous
residence
needed
to
rescue
clarendon
from
the
grasp
of
fetters
the
climate
agreed
with
phil
who
was
growing
like
a
weed
and
the
colonel
could
easily
defer
for
a
little
while
his
scheme
of
travel
and
the
further
disposition
of
his
future
so
when
he
reached
home
that
night
he
wrote
an
answer
to
a
long
and
gossipy
letter
received
from
kirby
about
that
time
in
which
the
latter
gave
a
detailed
account
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
favourite
club
and
among
their
mutual
friends
and
reported
progress
in
the
search
for
some
venture
worthy
of
their
mettle
the
colonel
replied
that
phil
and
he
were
well
that
he
was
interesting
himself
in
a
local
enterprise
which
would
certainly
occupy
him
for
some
months
and
that
he
would
not
visit
new
york
during
the
summer
unless
it
were
to
drop
in
for
a
day
or
two
on
business
and
return
immediately
a
letter
from
jerviss
received
about
the
same
time
was
less
easily
disposed
of
she
had
learned
from
kirby
of
the
chivalrous
manner
in
which
french
had
protected
her
interests
and
spared
her
feelings
in
the
fight
with
consolidated
bagging
she
had
not
been
able
she
said
to
thank
him
adequately
before
he
went
away
because
she
had
not
known
how
much
she
owed
him
nor
could
she
fittingly
express
herself
on
paper
she
could
only
renew
her
invitation
to
him
to
join
her
house
party
at
newport
in
july
the
guests
would
be
friends
of
his
she
would
be
glad
to
invite
any
others
that
he
might
suggest
she
would
then
have
the
opportunity
to
thank
him
in
person
the
colonel
was
not
unmoved
by
this
frank
and
grateful
letter
and
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
reward
he
might
claim
from
her
gratitude
had
the
letter
come
a
few
weeks
sooner
it
might
have
had
a
different
answer
but
now
after
the
first
pang
of
regret
his
only
problem
was
how
to
refuse
gracefully
her
offered
hospitality
he
was
sorry
he
replied
not
to
be
able
to
join
her
house
party
that
summer
but
during
the
greater
part
of
it
he
would
be
detained
in
the
south
by
certain
matters
into
which
he
had
been
insensibly
drawn
as
for
her
thanks
she
owed
him
none
he
had
only
done
his
duty
and
had
already
been
thanked
too
much
so
thoroughly
had
colonel
french
entered
into
the
spirit
of
his
yet
undefined
contest
with
fetters
that
his
life
in
new
york
save
when
these
friendly
communications
recalled
it
seemed
far
away
and
of
slight
retrospective
interest
every
one
knows
of
the
blind
spot
in
the
field
of
vision
new
york
was
for
the
time
being
the
blind
spot
that
it
might
reassert
its
influence
was
always
possible
but
for
the
present
new
york
was
of
no
more
interest
to
him
than
canton
or
bogota
having
revelled
for
a
few
pleasant
weeks
in
memories
of
a
remoter
past
the
reaction
had
projected
his
thoughts
forward
into
the
future
his
life
in
new
york
and
in
the
clarendon
of
the
present
these
were
mere
transitory
embodiments
he
lived
in
the
clarendon
yet
to
be
a
clarendon
rescued
from
fetters
purified
rehabilitated
and
no
compassionate
angel
warned
him
how
tenacious
of
life
that
which
fetters
stood
for
might
be
that
survival
of
the
spirit
of
slavery
under
which
the
land
still
groaned
and
travailed
the
growth
of
generations
which
it
would
take
more
than
one
generation
to
destroy
in
describing
to
judge
bullard
his
visit
to
the
cotton
mill
the
colonel
was
not
sparing
of
his
indignation
the
men
he
declared
with
emphasis
who
are
responsible
for
that
sort
of
thing
are
enemies
of
mankind
i
been
in
business
for
twenty
years
but
i
have
never
sought
to
make
money
by
trading
on
the
souls
and
bodies
of
women
and
children
i
saw
the
little
darkies
running
about
the
streets
down
there
at
carthage
they
were
poor
and
ragged
and
dirty
but
they
were
out
in
the
air
and
the
sunshine
they
have
a
chance
to
get
their
growth
to
go
to
school
and
learn
something
the
white
children
are
worked
worse
than
slaves
and
are
growing
up
dulled
and
stunted
physically
and
mentally
our
folks
down
here
are
mighty
judge
we
wake
them
up
we
build
a
model
cotton
mill
and
run
it
with
decent
hours
and
decent
wages
and
treat
the
operatives
like
human
beings
with
bodies
to
nourish
minds
to
develop
and
souls
to
save
fetters
and
his
crowd
will
have
to
come
up
to
our
standard
or
else
we
take
their
hands
away
judge
bullard
had
looked
surprised
when
the
colonel
began
his
denunciation
and
though
he
said
little
his
expression
when
the
colonel
had
finished
was
very
thoughtful
and
not
altogether
happy
it
was
the
week
after
the
colonel
house
warming
graciella
was
not
happy
she
was
sitting
erect
and
graceful
as
she
always
sat
on
the
top
step
of
the
piazza
ben
dudley
occupied
the
other
end
of
the
step
his
model
stood
neglected
beside
him
and
he
was
looking
straight
at
graciella
whose
eyes
avoiding
his
were
bent
upon
a
copy
of
jane
eyre
held
open
in
her
hand
there
was
an
unwonted
silence
between
them
which
ben
was
the
first
to
break
will
you
go
for
a
walk
with
me
he
asked
i
sorry
ben
she
replied
but
i
have
an
engagement
to
go
driving
with
colonel
french
ben
dark
cheek
grew
darker
and
he
damned
colonel
french
softly
beneath
his
breath
he
could
not
ask
graciella
to
drive
for
their
old
buggy
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
and
he
had
no
money
to
hire
a
better
one
the
only
reason
why
he
ever
had
wanted
money
was
because
of
her
if
she
must
have
money
or
the
things
that
money
alone
would
buy
he
must
get
money
or
lose
her
as
long
as
he
had
no
rival
there
was
hope
but
could
he
expect
to
hold
his
own
against
a
millionaire
who
had
the
garments
and
the
manners
of
the
great
outside
world
i
suppose
the
colonel
here
every
night
as
well
as
every
day
he
said
and
that
you
talk
to
him
all
the
time
no
ben
he
is
here
every
night
nor
every
day
his
old
darky
peter
brings
phil
over
every
day
but
when
the
colonel
comes
he
talks
to
grandmother
and
aunt
laura
as
well
as
to
me
graciella
had
risen
from
the
step
and
was
now
enthroned
in
a
armchair
an
attitude
more
in
keeping
with
the
air
of
dignity
which
she
felt
constrained
to
assume
as
a
cloak
for
an
uneasy
conscience
graciella
was
not
happy
she
had
reached
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
realised
that
she
must
choose
between
them
and
yet
she
hesitated
every
consideration
of
prudence
dictated
that
she
choose
colonel
french
rather
than
ben
the
colonel
was
rich
and
could
gratify
all
her
ambitions
there
could
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
he
was
fond
of
her
and
she
had
heard
it
said
by
those
more
experienced
than
she
and
therefore
better
qualified
to
judge
that
he
was
infatuated
with
her
certainly
he
had
shown
her
a
great
deal
of
attention
he
had
taken
her
driving
he
had
lent
her
books
and
music
he
had
brought
or
sent
the
new
york
paper
every
day
for
her
to
read
he
had
been
kind
to
her
aunt
laura
too
probably
for
her
sake
for
the
colonel
was
kind
by
nature
and
wished
to
make
everyone
about
him
happy
it
was
fortunate
that
her
aunt
laura
was
fond
of
philip
if
she
should
decide
to
marry
the
colonel
she
would
have
her
aunt
laura
come
and
make
her
home
with
them
she
could
give
philip
the
attention
with
which
his
stepmother
social
duties
might
interfere
it
was
hardly
likely
that
her
aunt
entertained
any
hope
of
marriage
indeed
miss
laura
had
long
since
professed
herself
resigned
to
old
maidenhood
but
in
spite
of
these
rosy
dreams
graciella
was
not
happy
to
marry
the
colonel
she
must
give
up
ben
and
ben
discarded
loomed
up
larger
than
ben
accepted
she
liked
ben
she
was
accustomed
to
ben
ben
was
young
and
youth
attracted
youth
other
things
being
equal
she
would
have
preferred
him
to
the
colonel
but
ben
was
poor
he
had
nothing
and
his
prospects
for
the
future
were
not
alluring
he
would
inherit
little
and
that
little
not
until
his
uncle
death
he
had
no
profession
he
was
not
even
a
good
farmer
and
trifled
away
with
his
useless
models
and
mechanical
toys
the
time
he
might
have
spent
in
making
his
uncle
plantation
productive
graciella
did
not
know
that
fetters
had
a
mortgage
on
the
plantation
or
ben
prospects
would
have
seemed
even
more
hopeless
she
felt
sorry
not
only
for
herself
but
for
ben
as
well
sorry
that
he
should
lose
her
for
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
sincerely
but
her
first
duty
was
to
herself
conscious
that
she
possessed
talents
social
and
otherwise
it
was
not
her
view
of
creative
wisdom
that
it
should
implant
in
the
mind
tastes
and
in
the
heart
longings
destined
never
to
be
realised
she
must
discourage
ben
gently
and
gradually
for
of
course
he
would
suffer
and
humanity
as
well
as
friendship
counselled
kindness
a
gradual
breaking
off
too
would
be
less
harrowing
to
her
own
feelings
i
suppose
you
admire
colonel
french
immensely
said
ben
with
assumed
impartiality
oh
i
like
him
reasonably
well
she
said
with
an
equal
lack
of
candour
his
conversation
is
improving
he
has
lived
in
the
metropolis
and
has
seen
so
much
of
the
world
that
he
can
scarcely
speak
without
saying
something
interesting
it
a
liberal
education
to
converse
with
people
who
have
had
opportunities
it
helps
to
prepare
my
mind
for
life
at
the
north
you
set
a
great
deal
of
store
by
the
north
graciella
anybody
would
allow
to
listen
to
you
that
you
did
love
your
own
country
i
love
the
south
ben
as
i
loved
aunt
lou
my
old
black
mammy
laid
in
her
arms
many
a
day
and
i
cried
my
eyes
out
when
she
died
but
that
did
mean
that
i
never
wanted
to
see
any
one
else
nor
am
i
going
to
live
in
the
south
a
minute
longer
than
i
can
help
because
it
too
slow
and
new
york
is
all
i
want
to
travel
and
see
the
world
the
south
is
away
behind
she
had
said
much
the
same
thing
weeks
before
but
then
it
had
been
spontaneous
now
she
was
purposely
trying
to
make
ben
see
how
unreasonable
was
his
hope
ben
stood
as
he
obscurely
felt
upon
delicate
ground
graciella
had
not
been
the
only
person
to
overhear
remarks
about
the
probability
of
the
colonel
seeking
a
wife
in
clarendon
and
jealousy
had
sharpened
ben
perceptions
while
it
increased
his
fears
he
had
little
to
offer
graciella
he
was
not
well
educated
he
had
nothing
to
recommend
him
but
his
youth
and
his
love
for
her
he
could
not
take
her
to
europe
or
even
to
new
york
at
least
not
yet
and
at
home
graciella
went
on
seriously
at
home
i
should
want
several
houses
a
town
house
a
country
place
a
seaside
cottage
when
we
were
tired
of
one
we
could
go
to
another
or
live
in
hotels
in
the
winter
in
florida
at
atlantic
city
in
the
spring
at
newport
in
the
summer
they
say
long
branch
has
gone
out
entirely
ben
had
a
vague
idea
that
long
branch
was
by
the
seaside
and
exposed
to
storms
gone
out
to
sea
he
asked
absently
he
was
sick
for
love
of
her
and
she
was
dreaming
of
watering
places
no
ben
said
graciella
compassionately
poor
ben
had
so
little
opportunity
for
schooling
he
was
not
to
blame
for
his
want
of
knowledge
but
could
she
throw
herself
away
upon
an
ignoramus
still
there
but
has
gone
out
of
fashion
oh
excuse
me
i
not
posted
on
these
fashionable
things
ben
relapsed
into
gloom
the
model
remained
untouched
he
could
not
give
graciella
a
house
he
would
not
have
a
house
until
his
uncle
died
graciella
had
never
seemed
so
beautiful
as
as
she
sat
dressed
in
the
cool
white
gown
which
miss
laura
slender
fingers
had
done
up
and
with
her
hair
dressed
after
the
daintiest
and
latest
fashion
chronicled
in
the
fireside
no
wonder
he
thought
that
a
jaded
old
man
of
the
world
like
colonel
french
should
delight
in
her
fresh
young
beauty
but
he
would
not
give
her
up
without
a
struggle
she
had
loved
him
she
must
love
him
still
and
she
would
yet
be
his
if
he
could
keep
her
true
to
him
or
free
from
any
promise
to
another
until
her
deeper
feelings
could
resume
their
sway
it
could
not
be
possible
after
all
that
had
passed
between
them
that
she
meant
to
throw
him
over
nor
was
he
a
man
that
she
could
afford
to
treat
in
such
a
fashion
there
was
more
in
him
than
graciella
imagined
he
was
conscious
of
latent
power
of
some
kind
though
he
knew
not
what
and
something
would
surely
happen
sometime
somehow
to
improve
his
fortunes
and
there
was
always
the
hope
the
possibility
of
finding
the
lost
money
he
had
brought
his
ralph
letter
with
him
as
he
had
promised
graciella
when
she
read
it
she
would
see
the
reasonableness
of
his
hope
and
might
be
willing
to
wait
at
least
a
little
while
any
delay
would
be
a
point
gained
he
shuddered
to
think
that
he
might
lose
her
and
then
the
day
after
the
irrevocable
vows
had
been
taken
the
treasure
might
come
to
light
and
all
their
life
be
spent
in
vain
regrets
graciella
was
skeptical
about
the
lost
money
even
treadwell
whose
faith
had
been
firm
for
years
had
ceased
to
encourage
his
hope
while
miss
laura
who
at
one
time
had
smiled
at
any
mention
of
the
matter
now
looked
grave
if
by
any
chance
he
let
slip
a
word
in
reference
to
it
but
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
his
inward
belief
and
he
would
try
its
effect
on
graciella
he
would
risk
ridicule
or
anything
else
for
her
sake
graciella
he
said
i
have
brought
my
uncle
malcolm
letter
along
to
convince
you
that
uncle
is
not
as
crazy
as
he
seems
and
that
there
some
foundation
for
the
hope
that
i
may
yet
be
able
to
give
you
all
you
want
i
do
want
to
relinquish
the
hope
and
i
want
you
to
share
it
with
me
he
produced
an
envelope
once
white
now
yellow
with
time
on
which
was
endorsed
in
ink
once
black
but
faded
to
a
pale
brown
and
hardly
legible
the
name
of
malcolm
dudley
mink
run
and
in
the
lower
corner
by
hand
of
viney
the
sheet
which
ben
drew
from
this
wrapper
was
worn
at
the
folds
and
required
careful
handling
graciella
moved
by
curiosity
had
come
down
from
her
throne
to
a
seat
beside
ben
upon
the
porch
she
had
never
had
any
faith
in
the
mythical
gold
of
old
ralph
dudley
the
people
of
an
earlier
generation
her
aunt
laura
perhaps
may
once
have
believed
in
it
but
they
had
long
since
ceased
to
do
more
than
smile
pityingly
and
shake
their
heads
at
the
mention
of
old
delusion
but
there
was
in
it
the
element
of
romance
strange
things
had
happened
and
why
might
they
not
happen
again
and
if
they
should
happen
why
not
to
ben
dear
old
shiftless
ben
she
moved
a
porch
pillow
close
beside
him
and
as
they
bent
their
heads
over
the
paper
her
hair
mingled
with
his
and
soon
her
hand
rested
unconsciously
upon
his
shoulder
it
was
a
voice
from
the
grave
said
ben
for
my
ralph
was
dead
when
the
letter
reached
uncle
malcolm
i
read
it
aloud
the
writing
is
sometimes
hard
to
make
out
and
i
know
it
by
heart
dear
malcolm
i
have
in
my
hands
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
government
money
in
gold
which
i
am
leaving
here
at
the
house
for
a
few
days
since
you
are
not
at
home
and
i
can
not
wait
i
have
confided
in
our
girl
viney
whom
i
can
trust
she
will
tell
you
when
she
gives
you
this
where
i
have
put
the
money
i
do
not
write
it
lest
the
letter
should
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
there
are
many
to
whom
it
would
be
a
great
temptation
i
shall
return
in
a
few
days
and
relieve
you
of
the
responsibility
should
anything
happen
to
me
write
to
the
secretary
of
state
at
richmond
for
instructions
what
to
do
with
the
money
in
great
affectionate
uncle
ralph
dudley
graciella
was
momentarily
impressed
by
the
letter
of
its
reality
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
there
in
black
and
white
or
rather
brown
and
yellow
it
sounds
like
a
letter
in
a
novel
she
said
thoughtfully
there
must
have
been
something
there
must
something
graciella
for
uncle
ralph
was
killed
the
next
day
and
never
came
back
for
the
money
but
uncle
malcolm
because
he
do
know
where
to
look
ca
find
it
and
old
aunt
viney
because
she
ca
talk
ca
tell
him
where
it
is
why
has
she
never
shown
him
asked
graciella
there
is
some
mystery
he
said
which
she
seems
unable
to
explain
without
speech
and
then
she
is
queer
as
queer
in
her
own
way
as
uncle
is
in
his
now
if
you
only
marry
me
graciella
and
go
out
there
to
live
with
your
uncommonly
fine
mind
find
it
you
could
help
but
find
it
it
would
just
come
at
your
call
like
my
dog
when
i
whistle
to
him
graciella
was
touched
by
the
compliment
or
by
the
serious
feeling
which
underlay
it
and
that
was
very
funny
about
calling
the
money
and
having
it
come
she
had
often
heard
of
people
whistling
for
their
money
but
had
never
heard
that
it
came
that
was
ben
idea
there
really
was
a
good
deal
in
ben
and
perhaps
after
all
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
and
whatever
graciella
thought
may
have
been
it
was
not
completed
as
colonel
french
lifted
the
latch
of
the
garden
gate
and
came
up
the
walk
toward
them
any
glamour
of
the
past
any
rosy
hope
of
the
future
vanished
in
the
solid
brilliancy
of
the
present
moment
old
ralph
was
dead
old
malcolm
nearly
so
the
money
had
never
been
found
would
never
come
to
light
there
on
the
doorstep
was
a
young
man
shabbily
attired
without
means
or
prospects
there
at
the
gate
was
a
fine
horse
in
a
handsome
trap
and
coming
up
the
walk
an
agreeable
gentleman
of
wealth
and
position
no
dead
romance
could
in
the
heart
of
a
girl
of
seventeen
hold
its
own
against
so
vital
and
brilliant
a
reality
thank
you
ben
she
said
adjusting
a
stray
lock
of
hair
which
had
escaped
from
her
radiant
crop
i
am
not
clever
enough
for
that
it
is
a
dream
your
ralph
had
ridden
too
long
and
too
far
in
the
sun
and
imagined
the
treasure
which
has
driven
your
uncle
malcolm
crazy
and
his
housekeeper
dumb
and
has
benumbed
you
so
that
you
sit
around
waiting
waiting
when
you
ought
to
be
working
working
no
ben
i
like
you
ever
so
much
but
you
will
never
take
me
to
new
york
with
your
uncle
ralph
money
nor
will
you
ever
earn
enough
to
take
me
with
your
own
you
must
excuse
me
now
for
here
comes
my
cavalier
do
hurry
away
aunt
laura
will
be
out
in
a
minute
you
can
stay
and
work
on
your
model
i
not
be
here
to
interrupt
you
good
evening
colonel
french
did
you
bring
me
a
i
want
to
look
at
the
advertisements
yes
my
dear
young
lady
there
is
wednesday
it
is
only
two
days
old
how
are
you
mr
dudley
sir
thank
you
ben
was
a
gentleman
by
instinct
though
his
heart
was
heavy
and
the
colonel
a
favoured
rival
by
the
way
said
the
colonel
i
wish
to
have
an
interview
with
your
uncle
about
the
old
mill
site
he
seems
to
have
been
a
stockholder
in
the
company
and
we
should
like
his
signature
if
he
is
in
condition
to
give
it
if
not
it
may
be
necessary
to
appoint
you
his
guardian
with
power
to
act
in
his
place
he
all
right
sir
in
the
morning
if
you
come
early
enough
replied
ben
courteously
you
can
tell
what
is
best
to
do
after
you
seen
him
thank
you
replied
the
colonel
i
have
my
man
drive
me
out
about
ten
say
if
you
be
at
home
you
ought
to
be
there
you
know
very
well
sir
i
be
there
all
day
and
shall
expect
you
graciella
threw
back
one
compassionate
glance
as
they
drove
away
behind
the
colonel
brown
horse
and
did
not
quite
escape
a
pang
at
the
sight
of
her
young
lover
still
sitting
on
the
steps
in
a
dejected
attitude
and
for
a
moment
longer
his
reproachful
eyes
haunted
her
but
graciella
prided
herself
on
being
above
all
things
practical
and
having
come
out
for
a
good
time
resolutely
put
all
unpleasant
thoughts
aside
there
was
good
in
the
neighbourhood
of
clarendon
and
the
colonel
was
of
the
best
some
of
the
roads
about
the
town
were
good
not
very
well
kept
roads
but
the
soil
was
a
sandy
loam
and
was
so
that
driving
was
pleasant
in
good
weather
the
colonel
had
several
times
invited
miss
laura
to
drive
with
him
and
had
taken
her
once
but
she
was
often
obliged
to
stay
with
her
mother
graciella
could
always
be
had
and
the
colonel
who
did
not
like
to
drive
alone
found
her
a
vivacious
companion
whose
naïve
comments
upon
life
were
very
amusing
to
a
seasoned
man
of
the
world
she
was
as
pretty
too
as
a
picture
and
the
colonel
had
always
admired
beauty
with
a
tempered
admiration
at
graciella
request
they
drove
first
down
main
street
past
the
where
she
wished
to
mail
a
letter
they
attracted
much
attention
as
they
drove
through
the
street
in
the
colonel
new
trap
graciella
billowy
white
gown
added
a
needed
touch
of
maturity
to
her
slender
youthfulness
a
big
straw
hat
shaded
her
brown
hair
and
she
sat
erect
and
held
her
head
high
with
a
vivid
consciousness
that
she
was
the
central
feature
of
a
very
attractive
whole
the
colonel
shared
her
thought
and
looked
at
her
with
frank
admiration
you
are
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
he
declared
i
suppose
i
an
object
of
envy
to
every
young
fellow
in
town
graciella
blushed
and
bridled
with
pleasure
i
am
not
interested
in
the
young
men
of
clarendon
she
replied
loftily
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
not
even
ben
asked
the
colonel
slyly
oh
she
replied
with
studied
indifference
dudley
is
really
a
cousin
and
only
a
friend
he
comes
to
see
the
family
the
colonel
attentions
could
have
but
one
meaning
and
it
was
important
to
disabuse
his
mind
concerning
ben
nor
was
she
the
only
one
in
the
family
who
entertained
that
thought
of
late
her
grandmother
had
often
addressed
her
in
an
unusual
way
more
as
a
woman
than
as
a
child
and
only
the
night
before
had
retold
the
old
story
of
her
own
sister
mary
who
many
years
before
had
married
a
man
of
fifty
he
had
worshipped
her
and
had
died
after
a
decent
interval
leaving
her
a
large
fortune
from
which
the
old
lady
had
deduced
that
on
the
whole
it
was
better
to
be
an
old
man
darling
than
a
young
man
slave
she
had
made
no
application
of
the
story
but
graciella
was
astute
enough
to
draw
her
own
conclusions
her
aunt
laura
too
had
been
unusually
kind
she
had
done
up
the
white
gown
twice
a
week
had
trimmed
her
hat
for
her
and
had
worn
old
gloves
that
she
might
buy
her
niece
a
new
pair
and
her
aunt
had
looked
at
her
wistfully
and
remarked
with
a
sigh
that
youth
was
a
glorious
season
and
beauty
a
great
responsibility
poor
dear
good
old
aunt
laura
when
the
expected
happened
she
would
be
very
kind
to
aunt
laura
and
repay
her
so
far
as
possible
for
all
her
care
and
sacrifice
it
was
only
a
short
time
after
his
visit
to
the
excelsior
mills
that
colonel
french
noticed
a
falling
off
in
the
progress
made
by
his
lawyer
judge
bullard
in
procuring
the
signatures
of
those
interested
in
the
old
mill
site
and
after
the
passing
of
several
weeks
he
began
to
suspect
that
some
adverse
influence
was
at
work
this
suspicion
was
confirmed
when
judge
bullard
told
him
one
day
with
some
embarrassment
that
he
could
no
longer
act
for
him
in
the
matter
i
right
sorry
colonel
he
said
i
should
like
to
help
you
put
the
thing
through
but
i
simply
ca
afford
it
other
clients
whose
business
i
have
transacted
for
years
and
to
whom
i
am
under
heavy
obligations
have
intimated
that
they
would
consider
any
further
activity
of
mine
in
your
interest
unfriendly
to
theirs
i
suppose
said
the
colonel
your
clients
wish
to
secure
the
mill
site
for
themselves
nothing
imparts
so
much
value
to
a
thing
as
the
notion
that
somebody
else
wants
it
of
course
i
ca
ask
you
to
act
for
me
further
and
if
you
make
out
your
bill
i
hand
you
a
check
i
hope
said
judge
bullard
there
be
no
about
our
separation
oh
no
responded
the
colonel
politely
not
at
all
business
is
business
and
a
man
own
interests
are
his
first
concern
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
replied
the
lawyer
much
relieved
he
had
feared
that
the
colonel
might
view
the
matter
differently
some
men
you
know
he
said
might
have
kept
on
and
worked
against
you
while
accepting
your
retainer
there
are
such
skunks
at
the
bar
there
are
black
sheep
in
every
fold
returned
the
colonel
with
a
cold
smile
it
would
be
unprofessional
i
suppose
to
name
your
client
so
i
not
ask
you
the
judge
did
not
volunteer
the
information
but
the
colonel
knew
instinctively
whence
came
opposition
to
his
plan
and
investigation
confirmed
his
intuition
judge
bullard
was
counsel
for
fetters
in
all
matters
where
skill
and
knowledge
were
important
and
fetters
held
his
note
secured
by
mortgage
for
money
loaned
for
dirty
work
fetters
used
tools
of
baser
metal
but
like
a
wise
man
he
knew
when
these
were
useless
and
was
shrewd
enough
to
keep
the
best
lawyers
under
his
control
the
colonel
after
careful
inquiry
engaged
to
take
judge
place
one
albert
caxton
a
member
of
a
good
old
family
a
young
man
and
a
capable
lawyer
who
had
no
ascertainable
connection
with
fetters
and
who
in
common
with
a
small
fraction
of
the
best
people
regarded
fetters
with
distrust
and
ascribed
his
wealth
to
usury
and
to
what
in
more
recent
years
has
come
to
be
known
as
graft
to
a
man
of
colonel
french
business
training
opposition
was
merely
a
spur
to
effort
he
had
not
run
a
race
of
twenty
years
in
the
commercial
field
to
be
worsted
in
the
first
heat
by
the
petty
boss
of
a
southern
backwoods
county
why
fetters
opposed
him
he
did
not
know
perhaps
he
wished
to
defeat
a
possible
rival
or
merely
to
keep
out
principles
and
ideals
which
would
conflict
with
his
own

colonel
french
spent
much
of
his
time
at
young
caxton
office
instructing
the
new
lawyer
in
the
details
of
the
mill
affair
caxton
proved
intelligent
zealous
and
singularly
sympathetic
with
his
client
views
and
plans
they
had
not
been
together
a
week
before
the
colonel
realised
that
he
had
gained
immensely
by
the
change
the
colonel
took
a
personal
part
in
the
effort
to
procure
signatures
among
others
that
of
old
malcolm
dudley
and
on
the
morning
following
the
drive
with
graciella
he
drove
out
to
mink
run
to
see
the
old
gentleman
in
person
and
discover
whether
or
not
he
was
in
a
condition
to
transact
business
before
setting
out
he
went
to
his
desk
his
father
desk
which
miss
laura
had
sent
to
him
to
get
certain
papers
for
old
signature
if
the
latter
should
prove
capable
of
a
legal
act
he
had
laid
the
papers
on
top
of
some
others
which
had
nearly
filled
one
of
the
numerous
small
drawers
in
the
desk
upon
opening
the
drawer
he
found
that
one
of
the
papers
was
missing
the
colonel
knew
quite
well
that
he
had
placed
the
paper
in
the
drawer
the
night
before
he
remembered
the
circumstance
very
distinctly
for
the
event
was
so
near
that
it
scarcely
required
an
exercise
not
to
say
an
effort
of
memory
an
examination
of
the
drawer
disclosed
that
the
piece
forming
the
back
of
it
was
a
little
lower
than
the
sides
possibly
thought
the
colonel
the
paper
had
slipped
off
and
fallen
behind
the
drawer
he
drew
the
drawer
entirely
out
and
slipped
his
hand
into
the
cavity
at
the
back
of
it
he
felt
the
corner
of
a
piece
of
paper
projecting
upward
from
below
the
paper
had
evidently
slipped
off
the
top
of
the
others
and
fallen
into
a
crevice
due
to
the
shrinkage
of
the
wood
or
some
defect
of
construction
the
opening
for
the
drawer
was
so
shallow
that
though
he
could
feel
the
end
of
the
paper
he
was
unable
to
get
such
a
grasp
of
it
as
would
permit
him
to
secure
it
easily
but
it
was
imperative
that
he
have
the
paper
and
since
it
bore
already
several
signatures
obtained
with
some
difficulty
he
did
not
wish
to
run
the
risk
of
tearing
it
he
examined
the
compartment
below
to
see
if
perchance
the
paper
could
be
reached
from
there
but
found
that
it
could
not
there
was
evidently
a
lining
to
the
desk
and
the
paper
had
doubtless
slipped
down
between
this
and
the
finished
panels
forming
the
back
of
the
desk
to
reach
it
the
colonel
procured
a
screw
driver
and
turning
the
desk
around
loosened
with
some
difficulty
the
screws
that
fastened
the
proper
panel
and
soon
recovered
the
paper
with
it
however
he
found
a
couple
of
yellow
envelopes
addressed
on
the
outside
to
major
john
treadwell
the
envelopes
were
unsealed
he
glanced
into
one
of
them
and
seeing
that
it
contained
a
sheet
folded
small
presumably
a
letter
he
thrust
the
two
of
them
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
intending
to
hand
them
to
miss
laura
at
their
next
meeting
they
were
probably
old
letters
and
of
no
consequence
but
they
should
of
course
be
returned
to
the
owners
in
putting
the
desk
back
in
its
place
after
returning
the
panel
and
closing
the
crevice
against
future
accidents
the
colonel
caught
his
coat
on
a
projecting
point
and
tore
a
long
rent
in
the
sleeve
it
was
an
old
coat
and
worn
only
about
the
house
and
when
he
changed
it
before
leaving
to
pay
his
call
upon
old
malcolm
dudley
he
hung
it
in
a
back
corner
in
his
clothes
closet
and
did
not
put
it
on
again
for
a
long
time
since
he
was
very
busily
occupied
in
the
meantime
the
two
old
letters
to
which
he
had
attached
no
importance
escaped
his
memory
altogether
the
colonel
coachman
a
young
coloured
man
by
the
name
of
tom
had
complained
of
illness
early
in
the
morning
and
the
colonel
took
peter
along
to
drive
him
to
mink
run
as
well
as
to
keep
him
company
on
their
way
through
the
town
they
stopped
at
treadwell
where
they
left
phil
who
had
he
declared
some
important
engagement
with
graciella
the
distance
was
not
long
scarcely
more
than
five
miles
ben
dudley
was
in
the
habit
of
traversing
it
on
horseback
twice
a
day
when
they
had
passed
the
last
straggling
cabin
of
the
town
their
way
lay
along
a
sandy
road
flanked
by
fields
green
with
corn
and
cotton
broken
by
stretches
of
scraggy
pine
and
oak
growing
upon
land
once
under
cultivation
but
impoverished
by
the
wasteful
methods
of
slavery
land
that
had
never
been
regenerated
and
was
now
no
longer
tilled
negroes
were
working
in
the
fields
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
buzzards
circled
lazily
against
the
distant
sky
although
it
was
only
early
summer
a
languor
in
the
air
possessed
the
colonel
senses
and
suggested
a
certain
charity
toward
those
of
his
neighbours
and
they
were
most
of
them
who
showed
no
marked
zeal
for
labour
work
he
murmured
is
best
for
happiness
but
in
this
climate
idleness
has
its
compensations
what
in
the
end
do
we
get
for
all
our
labour
fifty
cents
a
day
an
fin
suh
said
peter
supposing
the
soliloquy
addressed
to
himself
dat
dey
pays
roun
hyuh
when
they
reached
a
large
clearing
which
peter
pointed
out
as
their
destination
the
old
man
dismounted
with
considerable
agility
and
opened
a
rickety
gate
that
was
held
in
place
by
loops
of
rope
evidently
the
entrance
had
once
possessed
some
pretensions
to
elegance
for
the
huge
hewn
posts
had
originally
been
faced
with
dressed
lumber
and
finished
with
ornamental
capitals
some
fragments
of
which
remained
and
the
one
massive
hinge
hanging
by
a
slender
nail
had
been
wrought
into
a
fantastic
shape
as
they
drove
through
the
gateway
a
green
lizard
scampered
down
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
posts
where
he
had
been
sunning
himself
and
a
rattlesnake
lying
in
the
path
lazily
uncoiled
his
motley
brown
length
and
sounding
his
rattle
wriggled
slowly
off
into
the
rank
grass
and
weeds
that
bordered
the
carriage
track
the
house
stood
well
back
from
the
road
amid
great
oaks
and
elms
and
unpruned
evergreens
the
lane
by
which
it
was
approached
was
partly
overgrown
with
weeds
and
grass
from
which
the
mare
fetlocks
swept
the
dew
yet
undried
by
the
morning
sun
the
old
dudley
mansion
as
it
was
called
was
a
large
frame
house
built
in
the
colonial
style
with
a
roof
and
a
broad
piazza
along
the
front
running
the
full
length
of
both
stories
and
supported
by
thick
round
columns
each
a
solid
piece
of
pine
timber
gray
with
age
and
lack
of
paint
seamed
with
fissures
by
the
sun
and
rain
of
many
years
the
roof
swayed
downward
on
one
side
the
shingles
were
old
and
cracked
and
several
of
the
second
story
windows
were
boarded
up
and
others
filled
with
sashes
from
which
most
of
the
glass
had
disappeared
about
the
house
for
a
space
of
several
rods
on
each
side
of
it
the
ground
was
bare
of
grass
and
shrubbery
rough
and
uneven
lying
in
little
hillocks
and
hollows
as
though
recently
dug
over
at
haphazard
or
explored
by
some
vagrant
drove
of
hogs
at
one
side
beyond
this
barren
area
lay
a
kitchen
garden
enclosed
by
a
paling
fence
the
colonel
had
never
thought
of
young
dudley
as
being
at
all
energetic
but
so
a
place
argued
shiftlessness
in
a
marked
degree
when
the
carriage
had
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
house
the
colonel
became
aware
of
two
figures
on
the
long
piazza
at
one
end
in
a
massive
oaken
armchair
sat
an
old
man
seemingly
a
very
old
man
for
he
was
bent
and
wrinkled
with
thin
white
hair
hanging
down
upon
his
shoulders
his
face
of
a
highbred
and
strongly
marked
type
emphasised
by
age
had
the
contour
that
is
supposed
to
betoken
extreme
acquisitiveness
his
faded
eyes
were
turned
toward
a
woman
dressed
in
a
homespun
frock
and
a
muslin
cap
who
sat
bolt
upright
in
a
chair
at
the
other
end
of
the
piazza
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
looking
fixedly
toward
her
neither
of
them
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
the
colonel
and
when
the
old
man
rose
it
was
not
to
step
forward
and
welcome
his
visitor
but
to
approach
and
halt
in
front
of
the
woman
viney
he
said
sharply
i
am
tired
of
this
nonsense
i
insist
upon
knowing
immediately
where
my
uncle
left
the
money
the
woman
made
no
reply
but
her
faded
eyes
glowed
for
a
moment
like
the
ashes
of
a
dying
fire
and
her
figure
stiffened
perceptibly
as
she
leaned
slightly
toward
him
show
me
at
once
you
hussy
he
said
shaking
his
fist
or
have
reason
to
regret
it
i
have
you
whipped
his
cracked
voice
rose
to
a
shrill
shriek
as
he
uttered
the
threat
the
slumbrous
fire
in
the
woman
eyes
flamed
up
for
a
moment
she
rose
and
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
which
was
greater
than
the
old
man
made
some
incoherent
sounds
and
bent
upon
him
a
look
beneath
which
he
quailed
yes
viney
good
viney
he
said
soothingly
i
know
it
was
wrong
and
i
always
regretted
it
always
from
the
very
moment
but
you
should
bear
malice
servants
the
bible
says
should
obey
their
masters
and
you
should
bless
them
that
curse
you
and
do
good
to
them
that
despitefully
use
you
but
i
was
good
to
you
before
viney
and
i
was
kind
to
you
afterwards
and
i
know
you
forgiven
me
good
viney
viney
and
you
going
to
tell
me
are
you
he
pleaded
laying
his
hand
caressingly
upon
her
arm
she
drew
herself
away
but
seemingly
mollified
moved
her
lips
as
though
in
speech
the
old
man
put
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
listened
with
an
air
of
strained
eagerness
breathless
in
its
intensity
try
again
viney
he
said
that
a
good
girl
your
old
master
thinks
a
great
deal
of
you
viney
he
is
your
best
friend
again
she
made
an
inarticulate
response
which
he
nevertheless
seemed
to
comprehend
for
brightening
up
immediately
he
turned
from
her
came
down
the
steps
with
tremulous
haste
muttering
to
himself
meanwhile
seized
a
spade
that
stood
leaning
against
the
steps
passed
by
the
carriage
without
a
glance
and
began
digging
furiously
at
one
side
of
the
yard
the
old
woman
watched
him
for
a
while
with
a
that
was
entirely
oblivious
of
the
visitors
and
then
entered
the
house
the
colonel
had
been
completely
absorbed
in
this
curious
drama
there
was
an
air
of
weirdness
and
unreality
about
it
all
old
peter
was
as
silent
as
if
he
had
been
turned
into
stone
something
in
the
atmosphere
conduced
to
somnolence
for
even
the
horses
stood
still
with
no
signs
of
restlessness
the
colonel
was
the
first
to
break
the
spell
what

them

ter
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
ben
dudley
who
came
around
the
house
and
advancing
to
the
carriage
nodded
to
peter
and
greeted
the
colonel
respectfully
wo
you
and
come
in
he
asked
the
colonel
followed
him
into
the
house
to
a
plainly
furnished
parlour
there
was
a
wide
fireplace
with
a
fine
old
pair
of
brass
andirons
and
a
few
pieces
of
old
mahogany
furniture
incongruously
assorted
with
half
a
dozen
chairs
the
floor
was
bare
and
on
the
walls
half
a
dozen
of
the
old
dudleys
looked
out
from
as
many
oil
paintings
with
the
smooth
glaze
that
marked
the
touch
of
the
travelling
artist
in
the
days
before
portrait
painting
was
superseded
by
photography
and
crayon
enlargements
ben
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
his
uncle
old
malcolm
seemed
to
have
shaken
off
his
aberration
and
greeted
the
colonel
with
grave
politeness
i
am
glad
sir
he
said
giving
the
visitor
his
hand
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
have
been
working
in
the
garden
the
for
the
sake
of
the
exercise
we
have
negroes
enough
though
they
are
very
trifling
nowadays
but
the
exercise
is
good
for
my
health
i
have
trouble
at
times
with
my
rheumatism
and
with
my
my
memory
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
as
though
brushing
away
an
imaginary
cobweb
ben
tells
me
you
have
a
business
matter
to
present
to
me
the
colonel
somewhat
mystified
after
what
he
had
witnessed
by
this
sudden
change
of
manner
but
glad
to
find
the
old
man
seemingly
rational
stated
the
situation
in
regard
to
the
mill
site
old
malcolm
seemed
to
understand
perfectly
and
accepted
with
willingness
the
colonel
proposition
to
give
him
a
certain
amount
of
stock
in
the
new
company
for
the
release
of
such
rights
as
he
might
possess
under
the
old
incorporation
the
colonel
had
brought
with
him
a
contract
properly
drawn
which
was
executed
by
old
malcolm
and
witnessed
by
the
colonel
and
ben
i
trust
sir
said
dudley
that
you
will
not
ascribe
it
to
any
discourtesy
that
i
have
not
called
to
see
you
i
knew
your
father
and
your
grandfather
but
the
cares
of
my
estate
absorb
me
so
completely
that
i
never
leave
home
i
shall
send
my
regards
to
you
now
and
then
by
my
nephew
i
expect
in
a
very
short
time
when
certain
matters
are
adjusted
to
be
able
to
give
up
to
a
great
extent
my
arduous
cares
and
lead
a
life
of
greater
leisure
which
will
enable
me
to
travel
and
cultivate
a
wider
acquaintance
when
that
time
comes
sir
i
shall
hope
to
see
more
of
you
the
old
gentleman
stood
courteously
on
the
steps
while
ben
accompanied
the
colonel
to
the
carriage
it
had
scarcely
turned
into
the
lane
when
the
colonel
looking
back
saw
the
old
man
digging
furiously
the
condition
of
the
yard
was
explained
he
had
been
unjust
in
ascribing
it
to
ben
neglect
i
reckon
suh
remarked
peter
dat
he
fin
dat
million
dollahs
mistah
ben
marry
miss
an
take
huh
ter
new
perhaps
and
perhaps
not
said
the
colonel
to
himself
he
added
musingly
old
malcolm
will
start
on
a
long
journey
before
he
finds
the
million
dollars
the
watched
pot
never
boils
buried
treasure
is
never
found
by
those
who
seek
it
but
always
accidentally
if
at
all
on
the
way
back
they
stopped
at
the
treadwells
for
phil
phil
was
not
ready
to
go
home
he
was
intensely
interested
in
a
mechanical
mule
constructed
by
ben
dudley
out
of
bits
of
wood
and
leather
and
controlled
by
certain
springs
made
of
rubber
bands
by
manipulating
which
the
mule
could
be
made
to
kick
furiously
since
the
colonel
had
affairs
to
engage
his
attention
and
phil
seemed
perfectly
contented
he
was
allowed
to
remain
with
the
understanding
that
peter
should
come
for
him
in
the
afternoon
little
phil
had
grown
very
fond
of
old
peter
who
seemed
to
lavish
upon
the
child
all
of
his
love
and
devotion
for
the
dead
generations
of
the
french
family
the
colonel
had
taught
phil
to
call
the
old
man
uncle
peter
after
the
kindly
southern
fashion
of
slavery
days
which
denying
to
negroes
the
forms
of
address
applied
to
white
people
found
in
the
affectionate
terms
of
relationship
mammy
auntie
and
uncle
designations
that
recognised
the
respect
due
to
age
and
yet
lost
when
applied
to
slaves
their
conventional
significance
there
was
a
strong
sympathy
between
the
intelligent
child
and
the
undeveloped
old
negro
they
were
more
nearly
on
a
mental
level
leaving
out
of
course
the
factor
of
peter
experience
than
could
have
been
the
case
with
one
more
generously
endowed
than
peter
who
though
by
nature
faithful
had
never
been
unduly
bright
little
phil
became
so
attached
to
his
old
attendant
that
between
peter
and
the
treadwell
ladies
the
colonel
housekeeper
had
to
give
him
very
little
care
on
sunday
afternoons
the
colonel
and
phil
and
peter
would
sometimes
walk
over
to
the
cemetery
the
family
lot
was
now
kept
in
perfect
order
the
low
fence
around
it
had
been
repaired
and
several
leaning
headstones
straightened
up
but
guided
by
a
sense
of
fitness
and
having
before
him
the
awful
example
for
which
fetters
was
responsible
the
colonel
had
added
no
gaudy
monument
nor
made
any
alterations
which
would
disturb
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
spot
or
its
harmony
with
the
surroundings
in
the
northern
cemetery
where
his
young
wife
was
buried
he
had
erected
to
her
memory
a
stately
mausoleum
in
keeping
with
similar
memorials
on
every
hand
but
here
in
this
quiet
graveyard
where
his
ancestors
slept
their
last
sleep
under
the
elms
and
the
willows
display
would
have
been
out
of
place
he
had
however
placed
a
bench
underneath
the
trees
where
he
would
sit
and
read
his
paper
while
little
phil
questioned
old
peter
about
his
grandfather
and
his
their
prowess
on
the
hunting
field
and
the
wars
they
fought
in
and
the
old
man
would
delight
in
detailing
in
his
rambling
and
disconnected
manner
the
past
glories
of
the
french
family
it
was
always
a
new
story
to
phil
and
never
grew
stale
to
the
old
man
if
peter
could
be
believed
there
were
never
white
folks
so
brave
so
learned
so
wise
so
handsome
so
kind
to
their
servants
so
just
to
all
with
whom
they
had
dealings
phil
developed
a
very
great
fondness
for
these
dead
ancestors
whose
graves
and
histories
he
soon
knew
as
well
as
peter
himself
with
his
lively
imagination
he
found
pleasure
as
children
often
do
in
looking
into
the
future
the
unoccupied
space
in
the
large
cemetery
lot
furnished
him
food
for
much
speculation
papa
he
said
upon
one
of
these
peaceful
afternoons
there
room
enough
here
for
all
of
us
is
there
you
and
me
and
uncle
peter
yes
phil
said
his
father
there
room
for
several
generations
of
frenches
yet
to
sleep
with
their
fathers
little
phil
then
proceeded
to
greater
detail
here
he
said
next
to
grandfather
will
be
your
place
and
here
next
to
that
will
be
mine
and
here
next
to
me
will
be
but
no
he
said
pausing
reflectively
that
ought
to
be
saved
for
my
little
boy
when
he
grows
up
and
dies
that
is
when
i
grow
up
and
have
a
little
boy
and
he
grows
up
and
grows
old
and
dies
and
leaves
a
little
boy
and
but
where
will
uncle
peter
be
nem
mine

the
old

growed
up
on
the
afternoon
following
the
colonel
visit
to
mink
run
old
peter
when
he
came
for
phil
was
obliged
to
stay
long
enough
to
see
the
antics
of
the
mechanical
mule
and
had
not
that
artificial
animal
suddenly
refused
to
kick
and
lapsed
into
a
characteristic
balkiness
for
which
there
was
no
apparent
remedy
it
might
have
proved
difficult
to
get
phil
away
there
philip

peter
had
brought
with
him
some
hooks
and
lines
and
he
and
phil
after
leaving
the
house
followed
the
bank
of
the
creek
climbing
a
fence
now
and
then
until
they
reached
the
old
mill
site
upon
which
work
had
not
yet
begun
they
found
a
shady
spot
and
seating
themselves
upon
the
bank
baited
their
lines
and
dropped
them
into
a
quiet
pool
for
quite
a
while
their
patience
was
unrewarded
by
anything
more
than
a
nibble
by
and
by
a
black
cat
came
down
from
the
ruined
mill
and
sat
down
upon
the
bank
at
a
short
distance
from
them

with
a
movement
drew

a

one
of
they
moved
down
the
stream
and
were
soon
having
better
luck
uncle
peter
said
phil
while
they
were
on
their
way
home
there
could
be
any
at
all
in
the
graveyard
where
my
grandfather
is
buried
could
there
graciella
read
a
lot
of
the
tombstones
to
me
one
day
and
they
all
said
that
all
the
people
were
good
and
were
resting
in
peace
and
had
gone
to
heaven
tombstones
always
tell
the
truth
do
they
uncle
peter
happen
so
honey
happen
so
de
french
tombstones
does
an
as
ter
de
res
i
ain
gwine
to
nohow
fer
ef
i
did
de
folks
under
mought
come
back
an
me
jes
fer
spite
by
considerable
effort
and
a
moderate
outlay
the
colonel
at
length
secured
a
majority
of
interest
in
the
eureka
mill
site
and
made
application
to
the
state
through
caxton
for
the
redemption
of
the
title
the
opposition
had
either
ceased
or
had
proved
ineffective
there
would
be
some
little
further
delay
but
the
outcome
seemed
practically
certain
and
the
colonel
did
not
wait
longer
to
set
in
motion
his
plans
for
the
benefit
of
clarendon
i
told
that
fetters
says
he
get
the
mill
anyway
said
caxton
and
make
more
money
buying
it
under
foreclosure
than
by
building
a
new
one
he
ready
to
lend
on
it
now
oh
damn
fetters
exclaimed
the
colonel
elated
with
his
victory
he
had
never
been
a
profane
man
but
strong
language
came
so
easy
in
clarendon
that
one
dropped
into
it
unconsciously
the
mill
will
be
running
on
full
time
when
fetters
has
been
put
out
of
business
won
our
first
fight
and
i
never
really
seen
the
fellow
yet
as
soon
as
the
title
was
reasonably
secure
the
colonel
began
his
preparations
for
building
the
cotton
mill
the
first
step
was
to
send
for
a
new
england
architect
who
made
a
specialty
of
mills
to
come
down
and
look
the
site
over
and
make
plans
for
the
dam
the
mill
buildings
and
a
number
of
model
cottages
for
the
operatives
as
soon
as
the
estimates
were
prepared
he
looked
the
ground
over
to
see
how
far
he
could
draw
upon
local
resources
for
material
there
was
good
brick
clay
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
bricks
had
once
been
made
but
for
most
of
the
period
since
the
war
such
as
were
used
in
the
town
had
been
procured
from
the
ruins
of
old
buildings
it
was
cheaper
to
clean
bricks
than
to
make
them
since
the
construction
of
the
railroad
branch
to
clarendon
the
few
that
were
needed
from
time
to
time
were
brought
in
by
train
not
since
the
building
of
the
opera
house
block
had
there
been
a
kiln
of
brick
made
in
the
town
inquiry
brought
out
the
fact
that
in
case
of
a
demand
for
bricks
there
were
brickmakers
thereabouts
and
in
accordance
with
his
general
plan
to
employ
local
labour
the
colonel
looked
up
the
owner
of
the
brickyard
and
asked
if
he
were
prepared
to
take
a
large
contract
the
gentleman
was
palpably
troubled
by
the
question
well
colonel
he
said
i
do
know
i
you
were
goin
to
yo
bricks
from
philadelphia
no
barnes
returned
the
colonel
i
want
to
spend
the
money
here
in
clarendon
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
unemployed
labour
yes
there
does
till
you
want
somethin
done
then
there
ai
so
much
i
i
might
find
half
a
dozen
niggers
round
here
that
know
how
to
make
brick
and
there
several
more
that
have
moved
away
that
i
can
get
back
if
i
send
for
them
if
you
think
you
want
brick
made
here
i
try
to
get
them
out
for
you
they
cost
you
though
as
much
if
not
more
than
you
have
to
pay
for
bricks
from
the
the
colonel
declared
that
he
preferred
the
local
product
well
i
shore
i
do
see
why
said
the
brickmaker
they
not
be
as
smooth
or
as
uniform
in
colour
they
be
clarendon
brick
returned
the
colonel
and
i
want
this
to
be
a
clarendon
enterprise
from
the
ground
up
well
said
barnes
resignedly
if
you
must
have
brick
i
suppose
i
have
to
make
i
see
what
i
can
do
colonel
french
then
turned
the
brick
matter
over
to
caxton
who
in
the
course
of
a
week
worried
barnes
into
a
contract
to
supply
so
many
thousand
brick
within
a
given
time
i
do
like
that
there
time
limit
said
the
brickmaker
but
i
reckon
i
can
make
them
brick
as
fast
as
you
can
get
anybody
roun
here
to
lay
when
in
the
course
of
another
week
the
colonel
saw
signs
of
activity
about
the
old
brickyard
he
proceeded
with
the
next
step
which
was
to
have
the
ruins
of
the
old
factory
cleared
away
well
colonel
said
major
mclean
one
day
when
the
colonel
dropped
into
the
hotel
where
the
major
hung
out
a
good
part
of
the
time
i
you
goin
to
hire
white
folks
to
do
the
work
over
there
why
replied
the
colonel
i
had
thought
about
the
colour
of
the
workmen
there
be
plenty
i
guess
for
all
who
apply
so
long
as
it
lasts
you
have
trouble
if
you
hire
niggers
said
the
major
find
that
they
wo
work
when
you
want
to
they
not
reliable
they
have
no
sense
of
responsibility
as
soon
as
they
get
a
dollar
they
lay
off
to
spend
it
and
leave
yo
work
at
the
mos
critical
point
well
now
major
replied
the
colonel
i
have
noticed
any
unnatural
activity
among
the
white
men
of
the
town
the
negroes
have
to
live
or
seem
to
think
they
have
and
i
give
a
chance
to
turn
an
honest
penny
by
the
way
major
i
need
a
superintendent
to
look
after
the
work
it
do
require
an
expert
but
merely
a
good
man
gentleman
preferred
whom
i
can
trust
to
see
that
my
ideas
are
carried
out
perhaps
you
can
recommend
such
a
person
the
major
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
before
answering
he
might
of
course
offer
his
own
services
the
pay
would
doubtless
be
good
but
he
had
not
done
any
real
work
for
years
his
wife
owned
their
home
his
daughter
taught
in
the
academy
he
was
drawn
on
jury
nearly
every
term
was
tax
assessor
now
and
then
and
a
judge
or
clerk
of
elections
upon
occasion
nor
did
he
think
that
steady
employment
would
agree
with
his
health
while
it
would
certainly
interfere
with
his
pleasant
visits
with
the
drummers
at
the
hotel
i
be
glad
to
take
the
position
myself
colonel
he
said
but
i
wo
have
the
time
the
campaign
will
be
hummin
in
a
month
or
so
an
my
political
duties
will
occupy
all
my
leisure
but
i
bear
the
matter
in
mind
an
see
if
i
can
think
of
any
suitable
person
the
colonel
thanked
him
he
had
hardly
expected
the
major
to
offer
his
services
but
had
merely
wished
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
to
try
the
experiment
what
the
colonel
really
needed
was
a
good
foreman
he
had
used
the
word
superintendent
merely
on
the
major
account
as
less
suggestive
of
work
he
found
a
poor
white
man
however
green
by
name
who
seemed
capable
and
energetic
and
a
gang
of
labourers
under
his
charge
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
clearing
the
mill
site
and
preparing
for
the
foundations
of
a
new
dam
when
it
was
learned
that
the
colonel
was
paying
his
labourers
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
there
was
considerable
criticism
on
the
ground
that
such
lavishness
would
demoralise
the
labour
market
the
usual
daily
wage
of
the
negro
labourer
being
from
fifty
to
cents
but
since
most
of
the
colonel
money
soon
found
its
way
through
the
channels
of
trade
into
the
pockets
of
the
white
people
the
criticism
soon
died
a
natural
death
once
started
in
his
career
of
active
benevolence
the
natural
love
of
thoroughness
combined
with
a
philanthropic
zeal
as
pleasant
as
it
was
novel
sought
out
new
reforms
they
were
easily
found
he
had
begun
with
wise
foresight
at
the
foundations
of
prosperity
by
planning
an
industry
in
which
the
people
could
find
employment
but
there
were
subtler
needs
mental
and
spiritual
to
be
met
education
for
instance
so
important
to
real
development
languished
in
clarendon
there
was
a
select
private
school
for
young
ladies
attended
by
the
daughters
of
those
who
could
not
send
their
children
away
to
school
a
few
of
the
town
boys
went
away
to
military
schools
the
remainder
of
the
white
youth
attended
the
academy
which
was
a
thoroughly
democratic
institution
deriving
its
support
partly
from
the
public
school
fund
and
partly
from
private
subscriptions
there
was
a
coloured
public
school
taught
by
a
negro
teacher
neither
school
had
so
far
as
the
colonel
could
learn
attained
any
very
high
degree
of
efficiency
at
one
time
the
colonel
had
contemplated
building
a
schoolhouse
for
the
children
of
the
mill
hands
but
upon
second
thought
decided
that
the
expenditure
would
be
more
widely
useful
if
made
through
the
channels
already
established
if
the
old
academy
building
were
repaired
and
a
wing
constructed
for
which
there
was
ample
room
upon
the
grounds
it
would
furnish
any
needed
additional
accommodation
for
the
children
of
the
operatives
and
avoid
the
drawing
of
any
line
that
might
seem
to
put
these
in
a
class
apart
there
were
already
lines
enough
in
the
town
the
deep
and
distinct
colour
line
theoretically
but
with
occasional
curious
exceptions
the
old
line
between
the
rich
white
folks
or
aristocrats
no
longer
rich
most
of
them
but
retaining
some
of
their
former
wealth
and
clinging
tenaciously
to
a
waning
prestige
and
the
poor
whites
still
at
a
social
disadvantage
but
gradually
evolving
a
solid
middle
class
with
reinforcements
from
the
decaying
aristocracy
and
producing
now
and
then
some
ambitious
and
successful
man
like
fetters
to
emphasise
these
distinctions
was
no
part
of
the
colonel
plan
to
eradicate
them
entirely
in
any
stated
time
was
of
course
impossible
human
nature
being
what
it
was
but
he
would
do
nothing
to
accentuate
them
his
mill
hands
should
become
like
the
mill
hands
in
new
england
towns
an
intelligent
and
therefore
respected
element
of
an
enlightened
population
and
the
whole
town
should
share
equally
in
anything
he
might
spend
for
their
benefit
he
found
much
pleasure
in
talking
over
these
fine
plans
of
his
with
laura
treadwell
caxton
had
entered
into
them
with
the
enthusiasm
of
an
impressionable
young
man
brought
into
close
contact
with
a
forceful
personality
but
in
miss
laura
the
colonel
found
a
sympathy
that
was
more
than
intellectual
that
reached
down
to
sources
of
spiritual
strength
and
inspiration
which
the
colonel
could
not
touch
but
of
which
he
was
conscious
and
of
which
he
did
not
hesitate
to
avail
himself
at
second
hand
little
phil
had
made
the
house
almost
a
second
home
and
the
frequent
visits
of
his
father
had
only
strengthened
the
colonel
admiration
of
laura
character
he
had
learned
not
from
the
lady
herself
how
active
in
good
works
she
was
a
lady
bountiful
in
any
large
sense
she
could
not
be
for
her
means
as
she
had
so
frankly
said
upon
his
first
visit
were
small
but
a
little
went
a
long
way
among
the
poor
of
clarendon
and
the
life
after
all
is
more
than
meat
and
the
body
more
than
raiment
and
advice
and
sympathy
were
as
often
needed
as
other
kinds
of
help
he
had
offered
to
assist
her
charities
in
a
substantial
way
and
she
had
permitted
it
now
and
then
but
had
felt
obliged
at
last
to
cease
mentioning
them
altogether
he
was
able
to
circumvent
this
delicacy
now
and
then
through
the
agency
of
graciella
whose
theory
was
that
money
was
made
to
spend
laura
he
said
one
evening
when
at
the
house
will
you
go
with
me
to
visit
the
academy
i
wish
to
see
with
your
eyes
as
well
as
with
mine
what
it
needs
and
what
can
be
done
with
it
it
shall
be
our
secret
until
we
are
ready
to
surprise
the
town
they
went
next
morning
without
notice
to
the
principal
the
school
was
well
ordered
but
the
equipment
poor
the
building
was
old
and
sadly
in
need
of
repair
the
teacher
was
an
officer
past
middle
life
well
taught
by
the
methods
in
vogue
fifty
years
before
but
scarcely
in
harmony
with
modern
ideals
of
education
in
spite
of
his
perfect
manners
and
unimpeachable
character
the
professor
as
he
was
called
was
generally
understood
to
hold
his
position
more
by
virtue
of
his
need
and
his
influence
than
of
his
fitness
to
instruct
he
had
several
young
lady
assistants
who
found
in
teaching
the
only
career
open
in
clarendon
to
white
women
of
good
family
the
recess
hour
arrived
while
they
were
still
at
school
when
the
pupils
marched
out
in
orderly
array
the
colonel
seizing
a
moment
when
miss
treadwell
and
the
professor
were
speaking
about
some
of
the
children
whom
the
colonel
did
not
know
went
to
the
rear
of
one
of
the
schoolrooms
and
found
without
much
difficulty
high
up
on
one
of
the
walls
the
faint
but
still
distinguishable
outline
of
a
pencil
caricature
he
had
made
there
thirty
years
before
if
the
wall
had
been
whitewashed
in
the
meantime
the
lime
had
scaled
down
to
the
original
plaster
only
the
name
which
had
been
written
underneath
was
illegible
though
he
could
reconstruct
with
his
mind
eye
and
the
aid
of
a
few
shadowy
strokes
bill
fetters
sneak
in
angular
letters
in
the
printed
form
the
colonel
smiled
at
this
survival
of
youthful
bigotry
yet
even
then
his
instinct
had
been
a
healthy
one
his
boyish
characterisation
of
fetters
schoolboy
was
not
an
inapt
description
of
fetters
man
mortgage
shark
labour
contractor
and
political
boss
bill
seeking
official
favour
had
reported
to
the
professor
of
that
date
some
boyish
escapade
in
which
his
schoolfellows
had
taken
part
and
it
was
in
revenge
for
this
meanness
that
the
colonel
had
chased
him
ignominiously
down
main
street
and
pilloried
him
upon
the
schoolhouse
wall
fetters
the
man
a
goliath
whom
no
david
had
yet
opposed
had
fastened
himself
upon
a
weak
and
disorganised
community
during
a
period
of
great
distress
and
had
succeeded
by
devious
ways
in
making
himself
its
master
and
as
the
colonel
stood
looking
at
the
picture
he
was
conscious
of
a
faint
echo
of
his
boyish
indignation
and
sense
of
outraged
honour
already
fetters
and
he
had
clashed
upon
the
subject
of
the
cotton
mill
and
fetters
had
retired
from
the
field
if
it
were
written
that
they
should
meet
in
a
struggle
for
the
soul
of
clarendon
he
would
not
shirk
the
conflict
laura
he
said
when
they
went
away
i
should
like
to
visit
the
coloured
school
will
you
come
with
me
she
hesitated
and
he
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
her
answer
was
dictated
by
a
fine
courage
why
certainly
i
will
go
why
not
it
is
a
place
where
a
good
work
is
carried
on
no
laura
said
the
colonel
smiling
you
need
not
go
on
second
thought
i
should
prefer
to
go
alone
she
insisted
but
he
was
firm
he
had
no
desire
to
go
counter
to
her
instincts
or
induce
her
to
do
anything
that
might
provoke
adverse
comment
miss
laura
had
all
the
fine
glow
of
courage
but
was
secretly
relieved
at
being
excused
from
a
trip
so
unconventional
so
the
colonel
found
his
way
alone
to
the
schoolhouse
an
unpainted
frame
structure
in
a
barren
sandy
lot
upon
a
street
somewhat
removed
from
the
centre
of
the
town
and
given
over
mainly
to
the
humble
homes
of
negroes
that
his
unannounced
appearance
created
some
embarrassment
was
quite
evident
but
his
friendliness
toward
the
negroes
had
already
been
noised
abroad
and
he
was
welcomed
with
warmth
not
to
say
effusion
by
the
principal
of
the
school
a
tall
stalwart
and
dark
man
with
an
intelligent
expression
a
deferential
manner
and
shrewd
but
guarded
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
jungle
the
colonel
had
heard
them
called
and
the
thought
came
to
him
was
it
some
ancestral
jungle
on
the
distant
coast
of
savage
africa
or
the
wilderness
of
another
sort
in
which
the
black
people
had
wandered
and
were
wandering
still
in
free
america
the
attendance
was
not
large
at
a
glance
the
colonel
saw
that
there
were
but
pupils
present
what
is
your
total
enrolment
he
asked
the
teacher
well
sir
was
the
reply
we
have
or
eighty
on
the
roll
but
it
threatened
rain
this
morning
and
as
a
great
many
of
them
have
got
good
shoes
they
stayed
at
home
for
fear
of
getting
their
feet
wet
the
colonel
had
often
noticed
the
black
children
paddling
around
barefoot
in
the
puddles
on
rainy
days
but
there
was
evidently
some
point
of
etiquette
connected
with
attending
school
barefoot
he
had
passed
more
than
children
on
the
streets
on
his
way
to
the
schoolhouse
the
building
was
even
worse
than
that
of
the
academy
and
the
equipment
poorer
still
upon
the
colonel
asking
to
hear
a
recitation
the
teacher
made
some
excuse
and
shrewdly
requested
him
to
make
a
few
remarks
they
could
recite
he
said
at
any
time
but
an
opportunity
to
hear
colonel
french
was
a
privilege
not
to
be
neglected
the
colonel
consenting
was
introduced
to
the
school
in
very
flowery
language
the
pupils
were
sitting
the
teacher
informed
them
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
man
a
distinguished
member
of
the
grand
old
aristocracy
of
their
grand
old
native
state
had
gone
to
the
great
north
and
grown
rich
and
famous
he
had
returned
to
his
old
home
to
scatter
his
vast
wealth
where
it
was
most
needed
and
to
give
his
fellow
townsmen
an
opportunity
to
add
their
applause
to
his
fame
he
was
present
to
express
his
sympathy
with
their
feeble
efforts
to
rise
in
the
world
and
he
wanted
the
scholars
all
to
listen
with
the
most
respectful
attention
colonel
french
made
a
few
simple
remarks
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
advantages
of
education
as
a
means
of
forming
character
and
of
fitting
boys
and
girls
for
the
work
of
men
and
women
in
former
years
his
people
had
been
charged
with
direct
responsibility
for
the
care
of
many
coloured
children
and
in
a
larger
and
indirect
way
they
were
still
responsible
for
their
descendants
he
urged
them
to
make
the
best
of
their
opportunities
and
try
to
fit
themselves
for
useful
citizenship
they
would
meet
with
the
difficulties
that
all
men
must
and
with
some
peculiarly
their
own
but
they
must
look
up
and
not
down
forward
and
not
back
seeking
always
incentives
to
hope
rather
than
excuses
for
failure
before
leaving
he
arranged
with
the
teacher
whose
name
was
taylor
to
meet
several
of
the
leading
coloured
men
with
whom
he
wished
to
discuss
some
method
of
improving
their
school
and
directing
their
education
to
more
definite
ends
the
meeting
was
subsequently
held
what
your
people
need
said
the
colonel
to
the
little
gathering
at
the
schoolhouse
one
evening
is
to
learn
not
only
how
to
read
and
write
and
think
but
to
do
these
things
to
some
definite
end
we
live
in
an
age
of
specialists
to
make
yourselves
valuable
members
of
society
you
must
learn
to
do
well
some
particular
thing
by
which
you
may
reasonably
expect
to
earn
a
comfortable
living
in
your
own
home
among
your
neighbours
and
save
something
for
old
age
and
the
education
of
your
children
get
together
take
advice
from
some
of
your
own
capable
leaders
in
other
places
find
out
what
you
can
do
for
yourselves
and
i
will
give
you
three
dollars
for
every
one
you
can
gather
for
an
industrial
school
or
some
similar
institution
take
your
time
and
when
you
ready
to
report
come
and
see
me
or
write
to
me
if
i
am
not
here
the
result
was
the
setting
in
motion
of
a
stagnant
pool
who
can
measure
the
force
of
hope
the
town
had
been
neglected
by
mission
boards
no
able
or
ambitious
negro
had
risen
from
its
midst
to
found
an
institution
and
find
a
career
the
coloured
school
received
a
grudging
dole
from
the
public
funds
and
was
left
entirely
to
the
supervision
of
the
coloured
people
it
would
have
been
surprising
had
the
money
always
been
expended
to
the
best
advantage
the
fact
that
a
white
man
in
some
sense
a
local
man
who
had
yet
come
from
the
far
north
the
land
of
plenty
with
feelings
friendly
to
their
advancement
had
taken
a
personal
interest
in
their
welfare
and
proved
it
by
his
presence
among
them
gave
them
hope
and
inspiration
for
the
future
they
had
long
been
familiar
with
the
friendship
that
curbed
restricted
and
restrained
and
concerned
itself
mainly
with
their
limitations
they
were
almost
hysterically
eager
to
welcome
the
of
a
friend
who
in
seeking
to
lift
them
up
was
obsessed
by
no
fear
of
pulling
himself
down
or
of
narrowing
in
some
degree
the
gulf
that
separated
them
who
was
willing
not
only
to
help
them
but
to
help
them
to
a
condition
in
which
they
might
be
in
less
need
of
help
the
colonel
touched
the
reserves
of
loyalty
in
the
negro
nature
exemplified
in
old
peter
and
such
as
he
who
knows
had
these
reserves
been
reached
sooner
by
strict
justice
and
patient
kindness
that
they
might
not
long
since
have
helped
to
heal
the
wounds
of
slavery
and
now
laura
said
the
colonel
when
we
have
improved
the
schools
and
educated
the
people
we
must
give
them
something
to
occupy
their
minds
we
must
have
a
library
a
public
library
that
will
be
splendid
she
replied
with
enthusiasm
a
public
library
continued
the
colonel
housed
in
a
beautiful
building
in
a
conspicuous
place
and
decorated
in
an
artistic
manner
a
shrine
of
intellect
and
taste
at
which
all
the
people
rich
and
poor
black
and
white
may
worship
miss
laura
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
thoughtful
but
henry
she
said
with
some
hesitation
do
you
mean
that
coloured
people
should
use
the
library
why
not
he
asked
do
they
not
need
it
most
perhaps
not
many
of
them
might
wish
to
use
it
but
to
those
who
do
should
we
deny
the
opportunity
consider
their
teachers
if
the
blind
lead
the
blind
shall
they
not
both
fall
into
the
ditch
yes
henry
that
is
the
truth
but
i
am
afraid
the
white
people
would
wish
to
handle
the
same
books
very
well
then
we
will
give
the
coloured
folks
a
library
of
their
own
at
some
place
convenient
for
their
use
we
need
not
strain
our
ideal
by
going
too
fast
where
shall
i
build
the
library
the
vacant
lot
she
said
between
the
and
the
bank
the
very
place
he
replied
it
belonged
to
our
family
once
and
i
shall
be
acquiring
some
more
ancestral
property
the
cows
will
need
to
find
a
new
pasture
the
announcement
of
the
colonel
plan
concerning
the
academy
and
the
library
evoked
a
hearty
response
on
the
part
of
the
public
and
the
hailed
it
as
the
dawning
of
a
new
era
with
regard
to
the
colonel
friendly
plans
for
the
negroes
there
was
less
enthusiasm
and
some
difference
of
opinion
some
commended
the
colonel
course
there
were
others
good
men
and
patriotic
men
who
would
have
died
for
liberty
in
the
abstract
men
who
sought
to
walk
uprightly
and
to
live
peaceably
with
all
but
who
by
much
brooding
over
the
conditions
surrounding
their
life
had
grown
hopelessly
pessimistic
concerning
the
negro
the
subject
came
up
in
a
little
company
of
gentlemen
who
were
gathered
around
the
colonel
table
one
evening
after
the
coffee
had
been
served
and
the
havanas
passed
around
your
zeal
for
humanity
does
you
infinite
credit
colonel
french
said
mackenzie
minister
of
the
presbyterian
church
who
was
one
of
these
prophetic
souls
but
i
fear
your
time
and
money
and
effort
will
be
wasted
the
negroes
are
hopelessly
degraded
they
have
degenerated
rapidly
since
the
war
how
do
you
know
doctor
you
came
here
from
the
north
long
after
the
war
what
is
your
standard
of
comparison
i
voice
the
unanimous
opinion
of
those
who
have
known
them
at
both
periods
do
agree
with
you
and
i
lived
here
before
the
war
there
is
certainly
one
smart
negro
in
town
nichols
the
coloured
barber
owns
five
houses
and
overreached
me
in
a
bargain
before
the
war
he
was
a
chattel
and
taylor
the
teacher
seems
to
be
a
very
sensible
fellow
yes
said
price
who
was
one
of
the
company
taylor
is
a
very
intelligent
negro
nichols
and
he
have
learned
how
to
live
and
prosper
among
the
white
people
they
are
exceptions
said
the
preacher
who
only
prove
the
rule
no
colonel
french
for
a
long
time
hoped
that
there
was
a
future
for
these
poor
helpless
blacks
but
of
late
i
have
become
profoundly
convinced
that
there
is
no
place
in
this
nation
for
the
negro
except
under
the
sod
we
will
not
assimilate
him
we
can
not
deport
him
and
therefore
o
man
of
god
must
we
exterminate
him
it
is
god
will
we
need
not
stain
our
hands
with
innocent
blood
if
we
but
sit
passive
and
leave
their
fate
to
time
they
will
die
away
in
discouragement
and
despair
already
disease
is
sapping
their
vitals
like
other
weak
races
they
will
vanish
from
the
pathway
of
the
strong
and
there
is
no
place
for
them
to
flee
when
they
go
hence
it
is
to
go
forever
it
is
the
law
of
life
which
god
has
given
to
the
earth
to
coddle
them
to
delude
them
with
false
hopes
of
an
unnatural
equality
which
not
all
the
power
of
the
government
has
been
able
to
maintain
is
only
to
increase
their
unhappiness
to
a
doomed
race
ignorance
is
euthanasia
and
knowledge
is
but
pain
and
sorrow
it
is
his
will
that
the
fittest
should
survive
and
that
those
shall
inherit
the
earth
who
are
best
prepared
to
utilise
its
forces
and
gather
its
fruits
my
dear
doctor
what
you
say
may
all
be
true
but
with
all
due
respect
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
that
these
people
have
a
future
that
there
is
a
place
for
them
here
that
they
have
made
fair
progress
under
discouraging
circumstances
that
they
will
not
disappear
from
our
midst
for
many
generations
if
ever
and
that
in
the
meantime
as
we
make
or
mar
them
we
shall
make
or
mar
our
civilisation
no
society
can
be
greater
or
wiser
or
better
than
the
average
of
all
its
elements
our
ancestors
brought
these
people
here
and
lived
in
luxury
some
of
them
or
went
into
bankruptcy
more
of
them
on
their
labour
after
three
hundred
years
of
toil
they
might
be
fairly
said
to
have
earned
their
liberty
at
any
rate
they
are
here
they
constitute
the
bulk
of
our
labouring
class
to
teach
them
is
to
make
their
labour
more
effective
and
therefore
more
profitable
to
increase
their
needs
is
to
increase
our
profits
in
supplying
them
i
take
my
chances
on
the
golden
rule
i
am
no
lover
of
the
negro
negro
i
do
not
know
but
i
should
rather
see
him
elsewhere
i
think
our
land
would
have
been
far
happier
had
none
but
white
men
ever
set
foot
upon
it
after
the
red
men
were
driven
back
but
they
are
here
through
no
fault
of
theirs
as
we
are
they
were
born
here
we
have
given
them
our
language
which
they
speak
more
or
less
corruptly
our
religion
which
they
practise
certainly
no
better
than
we
and
our
blood
which
our
laws
make
a
badge
of
disgrace
perhaps
we
could
not
do
them
strict
justice
without
a
great
sacrifice
upon
our
own
part
but
they
are
men
and
they
should
have
their
chance
at
least
chance
i
shall
pray
for
your
success
sighed
the
preacher
with
god
all
things
are
possible
if
he
will
them
but
i
can
only
anticipate
your
failure
the
colonel
is
growing
so
popular
with
his
ready
money
and
his
cheerful
optimism
said
old
general
thornton
another
of
the
guests
that
we
have
to
run
him
for
congress
as
soon
as
he
is
reconverted
to
the
faith
of
his
fathers
colonel
french
had
more
than
once
smiled
at
the
assumption
that
a
mere
change
of
residence
would
alter
his
matured
political
convictions
his
friends
seemed
to
look
upon
them
so
far
as
they
differed
from
their
own
as
a
mere
veneer
which
would
scale
off
in
time
as
had
the
multiplied
coats
of
whitewash
over
the
pencil
drawing
made
on
the
wall
in
his
callow
youth
you
see
the
old
general
went
on
it
a
social
matter
down
here
rather
than
a
political
one
with
this
ignorant
black
flood
sweeping
up
against
us
the
race
question
assumes
an
importance
which
overshadows
the
tariff
and
the
currency
and
everything
else
for
instance
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
vote
the
other
ticket
in
the
last
election
i
did
like
our
candidate
nor
our
platform
there
was
a
issue
between
sound
money
and
financial
repudiation
and
was
tired
of
the
domination
of
populists
and
demagogues
all
my
better
instincts
led
me
toward
a
change
of
attitude
and
i
boldly
proclaimed
the
fact
i
declared
my
political
and
intellectual
independence
at
the
cost
of
many
friends
even
my
own
scarcely
spoke
to
me
for
a
month
when
i
went
to
the
polls
old
sam
brown
the
triflingest
nigger
in
town
whom
i
had
seen
sentenced
to
jail
more
than
once
for
stealing
old
sam
brown
was
next
to
me
in
the
line
he
said
glad
you
is
got
on
de
right
side
at
las
an
is
gwine
to
vote
ticket
this
was
too
much
i
could
stand
the
other
party
in
the
abstract
but
not
in
the
concrete
i
voted
the
ticket
of
my
neighbours
and
my
friends
we
had
to
preserve
our
institutions
if
our
finances
went
to
smash
call
it
prejudice
call
it
what
you
like
it
human
nature
and
you
come
to
it
colonel
you
come
to
it
and
then
we
send
you
to
congress
i
might
not
care
to
go
returned
the
colonel
smiling
you
could
not
resist
sir
the
unanimous
demand
of
a
determined
constituency
upon
the
rare
occasions
when
in
this
state
the
office
has
had
a
chance
to
seek
the
man
it
has
never
sought
in
vain
time
slipped
rapidly
by
and
the
colonel
had
been
in
clarendon
a
couple
of
months
when
he
went
home
one
afternoon
and
not
finding
phil
and
peter
went
around
to
the
treadwells
as
the
most
likely
place
to
seek
them
henry
said
miss
laura
philip
does
not
seem
quite
well
there
are
dark
circles
under
his
eyes
and
he
has
been
coughing
a
little
the
colonel
was
startled
had
his
growing
absorption
in
other
things
led
him
to
neglect
his
child
phil
needed
a
mother
this
dear
thoughtful
woman
whom
nature
had
made
for
motherhood
had
seen
things
about
his
child
that
he
the
child
father
had
not
perceived
to
a
mind
like
colonel
french
this
juxtaposition
of
a
motherly
heart
and
a
motherless
child
seemed
very
pleasing
he
despatched
a
messenger
on
horseback
immediately
for
price
the
colonel
had
made
the
doctor
acquaintance
soon
after
coming
to
clarendon
and
out
of
abundant
precaution
had
engaged
him
to
call
once
a
week
to
see
phil
a
physician
of
skill
and
experience
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
breeding
a
thoughtful
student
of
men
and
manners
and
a
good
story
teller
he
had
proved
excellent
company
and
the
colonel
soon
numbered
him
among
his
intimate
friends
he
had
seen
phil
a
few
days
before
but
it
was
yet
several
days
before
his
next
visit
price
owned
a
place
in
the
country
several
miles
away
on
the
road
to
mink
run
and
thither
the
messenger
went
to
find
him
he
was
in
his
town
office
only
at
stated
hours
the
colonel
was
waiting
at
home
an
hour
later
when
the
doctor
drove
up
to
the
gate
with
ben
dudley
in
the
shabby
old
buggy
to
which
ben
sometimes
drove
his
one
good
horse
on
his
trips
to
town
i
broke
one
of
my
buggy
wheels
going
out
home
this
morning
explained
the
doctor
and
had
just
sent
it
to
the
shop
when
your
messenger
came
i
would
have
ridden
your
horse
back
and
let
the
man
walk
in
but
dudley
fortunately
came
along
and
gave
me
a
lift
he
looked
at
phil
left
some
tablets
with
directions
for
their
use
and
said
that
it
was
nothing
serious
and
the
child
would
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
what
he
needs
colonel
at
his
age
is
a
woman
care
but
for
that
matter
none
of
us
ever
get
too
old
to
need
that
i
have
tom
hitch
up
and
take
you
home
said
the
colonel
when
the
doctor
had
finished
with
phil
unless
you
stay
to
dinner
no
thank
you
said
the
doctor
i
much
obliged
but
i
told
my
wife
i
be
back
to
dinner
i
just
sit
here
and
wait
for
young
dudley
who
going
to
call
for
me
in
an
hour
there
a
fine
mind
colonel
that
never
had
a
proper
opportunity
for
development
if
he
had
half
the
chance
that
your
boy
will
he
would
make
his
mark
did
you
ever
see
his
uncle
malcolm
the
colonel
described
his
visit
to
mink
run
the
scene
on
the
piazza
the
interview
with
dudley
and
peter
story
about
the
hidden
treasure
is
the
old
man
sane
he
asked
his
mind
is
warped
undoubtedly
said
the
doctor
but
i
leave
it
to
you
whether
it
was
the
result
of
an
insane
delusion
or
not
if
you
care
to
hear
his
story
or
perhaps
you
heard
it
no
i
have
not
returned
the
colonel
but
i
should
like
to
hear
it
this
was
the
story
that
the
doctor
told
when
the
last
century
had
passed
the
mark
and
had
started
upon
its
decline
the
dudleys
had
already
owned
land
on
mink
run
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
and
were
one
of
the
richest
and
most
conspicuous
families
in
the
state
the
first
great
man
of
the
family
general
arthur
dudley
an
ardent
patriot
had
won
distinction
in
the
war
of
independence
and
held
high
place
in
the
councils
of
the
infant
nation
his
son
became
a
distinguished
jurist
whose
name
is
still
a
synonym
for
legal
learning
and
juridical
wisdom
in
ralph
dudley
the
son
of
judge
dudley
and
the
immediate
predecessor
of
the
demented
old
man
in
whom
now
rested
the
title
to
the
remnant
of
the
estate
the
family
began
to
decline
from
its
eminence
ralph
did
not
marry
but
led
a
life
of
ease
and
pleasure
wasting
what
his
friends
thought
rare
gifts
and
leaving
his
property
to
the
management
of
his
nephew
malcolm
the
orphan
son
of
a
younger
brother
and
his
prospective
heir
malcolm
dudley
proved
so
capable
a
manager
that
for
year
after
year
the
large
estate
was
left
almost
entirely
in
his
charge
the
owner
looking
to
it
merely
for
revenue
to
lead
his
own
life
in
other
places
the
civil
war
gave

a
career
not
upon
the
field
for
which
he
had
no
taste
but
in
administrative
work
which
suited
his
talents
and
imposed
more
arduous
tasks
than
those
of
actual
warfare
valour
was
of
small
account
without
arms
and
ammunition
a
commissariat
might
be
improvised
but
gunpowder
must
be
manufactured
or
purchased
ralph
nephew
malcolm
kept
bachelor
hall
in
the
great
house
the
only
women
in
the
household
were
an
old
black
cook
and
the
housekeeper
known
as
viney
a
negro
corruption
of
lavinia
a
tall
comely
young
light
mulattress
with
a
dash
of
cherokee
blood
which
gave
her
straighter
blacker
and
more
glossy
hair
than
most
women
of
mixed
race
have
and
perhaps
a
somewhat
different
temperamental
endowment
her
duties
were
not
onerous
compared
with
the
toiling
field
hands
she
led
an
easy
life
the
household
had
been
thus
constituted
for
ten
years
and
more
when
malcolm
dudley
began
paying
court
to
a
wealthy
widow
this
lady
a
todd
was
a
war
widow
who
had
lost
her
husband
in
the
early
years
of
the
struggle
war
while
it
took
many
lives
did
not
stop
the
currents
of
life
and
weeping
widows
sometimes
found
consolation
todd
was
of
clarendon
extraction
and
had
returned
to
the
town
to
pass
the
period
of
her
mourning
men
were
scarce
in
those
days
and
todd
was
no
longer
young
malcolm
dudley
courted
her
proposed
marriage
and
was
accepted
he
broke
the
news
to
his
housekeeper
by
telling
her
to
prepare
the
house
for
a
mistress
it
was
not
a
pleasant
task
but
he
was
a
resolute
man
the
woman
had
been
in
power
too
long
to
yield
gracefully
some
passionate
strain
of
the
mixed
blood
in
her
veins
broke
out
in
a
scene
of
hysterical
violence
her
pleadings
remonstrances
rages
were
all
in
vain
todd
was
rich
and
he
was
poor
should
his
uncle
see
fit
to
marry
always
a
possibility
he
would
have
nothing
he
would
carry
out
his
purpose
the
day
after
this
announcement
viney
went
to
town
sought
out
the
object
of
dudley
attentions
and
told
her
something
just
what
no
one
but
herself
and
the
lady
ever
knew
when
dudley
called
in
the
evening
the
widow
refused
to
see
him
and
sent
instead
a
curt
note
cancelling
their
engagement
dudley
went
home
puzzled
and
angry
on
the
way
thither
a
suspicion
flashed
into
his
mind
in
the
morning
he
made
investigations
after
which
he
rode
round
by
the
residence
of
his
overseer
returning
to
the
house
at
noon
he
ate
his
dinner
in
an
ominous
silence
which
struck
terror
to
the
heart
of
the
woman
who
waited
on
him
and
had
already
repented
of
her
temerity
when
she
would
have
addressed
him
with
a
look
he
froze
the
words
upon
her
lips
when
he
had
eaten
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
ordered
a
boy
to
bring
his
horse
round
to
the
door
he
waited
until
he
saw
his
overseer
coming
toward
the
house
then
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
rode
down
the
lane
passing
the
overseer
with
a
nod
ten
minutes
later
dudley
galloped
back
up
the
lane
and
sprang
from
his
panting
horse
as
he
dashed
up
the
steps
he
met
the
overseer
coming
out
of
the
house
you
have
not
i
have
sir
and
well
the
bit
my
hand
to
the
bone
and
would
have
stabbed
me
if
i
had
got
the
knife
away
from
her
better
have
the
niggers
look
after
her
she
shamming
a
fit
dudley
was
remorseful
and
finding
viney
unconscious
sent
hastily
for
a
doctor
the
woman
has
had
a
stroke
said
that
gentleman
curtly
after
an
examination
brought
on
by
brutal
treatment
by
g
d
dudley
i
would
have
thought
this
of
you
i
own
negroes
but
i
treat
them
like
human
beings
and
such
a
woman
i
ashamed
of
my
own
race
i
swear
i
am
if
we
are
whipped
in
this
war
and
the
slaves
are
freed
as
lincoln
threatens
it
will
be
god
judgment
many
a
man
has
been
shot
by
southern
gentlemen
for
language
less
offensive
but
dudley
conscience
made
him
meek
as
moses
it
was
a
mistake
he
faltered
and
i
shall
discharge
the
overseer
who
did
it
you
had
better
shoot
him
returned
the
doctor
he
has
no
soul
and
what
is
worse
no
discrimination
dudley
gave
orders
that
viney
should
receive
the
best
of
care
next
day
he
found
behind
the
clock
where
she
had
laid
it
the
letter
which
ben
dudley
many
years
after
had
read
to
graciella
on
treadwell
piazza
it
was
dated
the
morning
of
the
previous
day
an
hour
later
he
learned
of
the
death
of
his
uncle
who
had
been
thrown
from
a
fractious
horse
not
far
from
mink
run
and
had
broken
his
neck
in
the
fall
a
hasty
search
of
the
premises
did
not
disclose
the
concealed
treasure
the
secret
lay
in
the
mind
of
the
stricken
woman
as
soon
as
dudley
learned
that
viney
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
was
apparently
conscious
he
went
to
her
bedside
and
took
her
limp
hand
in
his
own
i
sorry
viney
mighty
sorry
i
assure
you
martin
went
further
than
i
intended
and
i
have
discharged
him
for
his
brutality
be
sorry
viney
to
learn
that
your
old
master
ralph
is
dead
he
was
killed
by
an
accident
within
ten
miles
of
here
his
body
will
be
brought
home
and
buried
dudley
thought
he
detected
in
her
expressionless
face
a
shade
of
sorrow
old
ralph
high
liver
and
genial
soul
had
been
so
indulgent
a
master
that
his
nephew
suffered
by
the
comparison
i
found
the
letter
he
left
with
you
he
continued
softly
and
must
take
charge
of
the
money
immediately
can
you
tell
me
where
it
is
one
side
of
viney
face
was
perfectly
inert
as
the
result
of
her
disorder
and
any
movement
of
the
other
produced
a
slight
distortion
that
spoiled
the
face
as
the
index
of
the
mind
but
her
eyes
were
not
dimmed
and
into
their
sombre
depths
there
leaped
a
sudden
fire
only
a
momentary
flash
for
almost
instantly
she
closed
her
lids
and
when
she
opened
them
a
moment
later
they
exhibited
no
trace
of
emotion
you
will
tell
me
where
it
is
he
repeated
a
request
came
awkwardly
to
his
lips
he
was
accustomed
to
command
viney
pointed
to
her
mouth
with
her
right
hand
which
was
not
affected
to
be
sure
he
said
hastily
you
can
not
speak
not
yet
he
reflected
for
a
moment
the
times
were
unsettled
should
a
wave
of
conflict
sweep
over
clarendon
the
money
might
be
found
by
the
enemy
should
viney
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
and
die
it
would
be
impossible
to
learn
anything
from
her
at
all
there
was
another
thought
which
had
rapidly
taken
shape
in
his
mind
no
one
but
viney
knew
that
his
uncle
had
been
at
mink
run
the
estate
had
been
seriously
embarrassed
by
roger
extravagant
patriotism
following
upon
the
heels
of
other
and
earlier
extravagances
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
would
in
part
make
good
the
loss
as
his
uncle
heir
he
had
at
least
a
moral
claim
upon
it
and
possession
was
nine
points
of
the
law
is
it
in
the
house
he
asked
she
made
a
negative
sign
in
the
barn
the
same
answer
in
the
yard
the
garden
the
spring
house
the
quarters
no
question
he
could
put
brought
a
different
answer
dudley
was
puzzled
the
woman
was
in
her
right
mind
she
was
no
liar
of
this
servile
vice
at
least
she
was
free
surely
there
was
some
mystery
you
saw
my
uncle
he
asked
thoughtfully
she
nodded
affirmatively
and
he
had
the
money
in
gold
yes
he
left
it
here
yes
positively
do
you
know
where
he
hid
it
she
indicated
that
she
did
and
pointed
again
to
her
silent
tongue
you
mean
that
you
must
regain
your
speech
before
you
can
explain
she
nodded
yes
and
then
as
if
in
pain
turned
her
face
away
from
him
viney
was
carefully
nursed
the
doctor
came
to
see
her
regularly
she
was
fed
with
dainty
food
and
no
expense
was
spared
to
effect
her
cure
in
due
time
she
recovered
from
the
paralytic
stroke
in
all
except
the
power
of
speech
which
did
not
seem
to
return
all
of
dudley
attempts
to
learn
from
her
the
whereabouts
of
the
money
were
equally
futile
she
seemed
willing
enough
but
though
she
made
the
effort
was
never
able
to
articulate
and
there
was
plainly
some
mystery
about
the
hidden
gold
which
only
words
could
unravel
if
she
could
but
write
a
few
strokes
of
the
pen
would
give
him
his
heart
desire
but
alas
viney
may
as
well
have
been
without
hands
for
any
use
she
could
make
of
a
pen
slaves
were
not
taught
to
read
or
write
nor
was
viney
one
of
the
rare
exceptions
but
dudley
was
a
man
of
resource
he
would
have
her
taught
he
employed
a
teacher
for
her
a
free
coloured
man
who
knew
the
rudiments
but
viney
handicapped
by
her
loss
of
speech
made
wretched
progress
from
whatever
cause
she
manifested
a
remarkable
stupidity
while
seemingly
anxious
to
learn
dudley
himself
took
a
hand
in
her
instruction
but
with
no
better
results
and
in
the
end
the
attempt
to
teach
her
was
abandoned
as
hopeless
years
rolled
by
the
fall
of
the
confederacy
left
the
slaves
free
and
completed
the
ruin
of
the
dudley
estate
part
of
the
land
went
at
ruinous
prices
to
meet
mortgages
at
ruinous
rates
part
lay
fallow
given
up
to
scrub
oak
and
pine
merely
enough
was
cultivated
or
let
out
on
shares
to
negro
tenants
to
provide
a
living
for
old
malcolm
and
a
few
servants
absorbed
in
dreams
of
the
hidden
gold
and
in
the
search
for
it
he
neglected
his
business
and
fell
yet
deeper
into
debt
he
worried
himself
into
a
lingering
fever
through
which
viney
nursed
him
with
every
sign
of
devotion
and
from
which
he
rose
with
his
mind
visibly
weakened
when
the
slaves
were
freed
viney
had
manifested
no
desire
to
leave
her
old
place
after
the
tragic
episode
which
had
led
to
their
mutual
undoing
there
had
been
no
relation
between
them
but
that
of
master
and
servant
but
some
gloomy
attraction
or
it
may
have
been
habit
held
her
to
the
scene
of
her
power
and
of
her
fall
she
had
no
kith
nor
kin
and
her
affliction
separated
her
from
the
rest
of
mankind
nor
would
dudley
have
been
willing
to
let
her
go
for
in
her
lay
the
secret
of
the
treasure
and
since
all
other
traces
of
her
ailment
had
disappeared
so
her
speech
might
return
the
fruitless
search
was
never
relinquished
and
in
time
absorbed
all
of
malcolm
interest
the
crops
were
left
to
the
servants
who
neglected
them
the
yard
had
been
dug
over
many
times
every
foot
of
ground
for
rods
around
had
been
sounded
with
a
pointed
iron
bar
the
house
had
suffered
in
the
search
no
crack
or
cranny
had
been
left
unexplored
the
spaces
between
the
walls
beneath
the
floors
under
the
hearths
every
possible
hiding
place
had
been
searched
with
little
care
for
any
resulting
injury
into
this
household
ben
dudley
left
alone
in
the
world
had
come
when
a
boy
of
fifteen
he
had
no
special
turn
for
farming
but
such
work
as
was
done
upon
the
old
plantation
was
conducted
under
his
supervision
in
the
decaying
old
house
on
the
neglected
farm
he
had
grown
up
in
harmony
with
his
surroundings
the
example
of
his
old
uncle
wrecked
in
mind
by
a
hopeless
quest
had
never
been
brought
home
to
him
as
a
warning
use
had
dulled
its
force
he
had
never
joined
in
the
search
except
casually
but
the
legend
was
in
his
mind
unconsciously
his
standards
of
life
grew
around
it
some
day
he
would
be
rich
and
in
order
to
be
sure
of
it
he
must
remain
with
his
uncle
whose
heir
he
was
for
the
money
was
there
without
a
doubt
his
had
hid
the
gold
and
left
the
letter
ben
had
read
it
the
neighbours
knew
the
story
or
at
least
some
vague
version
of
it
and
for
a
time
joined
in
the
search
surreptitiously
as
occasion
offered
and
each
on
his
own
account
it
was
the
common
understanding
that
old
malcolm
was
mentally
unbalanced
the
neighbouring
negroes
with
generous
imagination
fixed
his
mythical
and
elusive
treasure
at
a
million
dollars
not
one
of
them
had
the
faintest
conception
of
the
bulk
or
purchasing
power
of
one
million
dollars
in
gold
but
when
one
builds
a
castle
in
the
air
why
not
make
it
lofty
and
spacious
from
this
unwholesome
atmosphere
ben
dudley
found
relief
as
he
grew
older
in
frequent
visits
to
clarendon
which
invariably
ended
at
the
treadwells
who
were
indeed
distant
relatives
he
had
one
good
horse
and
in
an
hour
or
less
could
leave
behind
him
the
shabby
old
house
falling
into
ruin
the
demented
old
man
digging
in
the
disordered
yard
the
dumb
old
woman
watching
him
from
her
inscrutable
eyes
and
by
a
change
as
abrupt
as
that
of
coming
from
a
dark
room
into
the
brightness
of
midday
find
himself
in
a
lovely
garden
beside
a
beautiful
girl
whom
he
loved
devotedly
but
who
kept
him
on
the
ragged
edge
of
an
uncertainty
that
was
stimulating
enough
but
very
wearing
the
summer
following
colonel
french
return
to
clarendon
was
unusually
cool
so
cool
that
the
colonel
pleasantly
occupied
with
his
various
plans
and
projects
scarcely
found
the
heat
less
bearable
than
that
of
new
york
at
the
same
season
during
a
brief
torrid
spell
he
took
phil
to
a
southern
mountain
resort
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
upon
another
occasion
ran
up
to
new
york
for
a
day
or
two
on
business
in
reference
to
the
machinery
for
the
cotton
mill
which
was
to
be
ready
for
installation
some
time
during
the
fall
but
these
were
brief
interludes
and
did
not
interrupt
the
current
of
his
life
which
was
flowing
very
smoothly
and
pleasantly
in
its
new
channel
if
not
very
swiftly
for
even
the
colonel
was
not
able
to
make
things
move
swiftly
in
clarendon
during
the
summer
time
and
he
was
well
enough
pleased
to
see
them
move
at
all
kirby
was
out
of
town
when
the
colonel
was
in
new
york
and
therefore
he
did
not
see
him
his
mail
was
being
sent
from
his
club
to
denver
where
he
was
presumably
looking
into
some
mining
proposition
jerviss
the
colonel
supposed
was
at
the
seaside
but
he
had
almost
come
face
to
face
with
her
one
day
on
broadway
she
had
run
down
to
the
city
on
business
of
some
sort
moved
by
the
instinct
of
defense
the
colonel
by
a
quick
movement
avoided
the
meeting
and
felt
safer
when
the
lady
was
well
out
of
sight
he
did
not
wish
at
this
time
to
be
diverted
from
his
southern
interests
and
the
image
of
another
woman
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
one
moonlight
evening
a
day
or
two
after
his
return
from
this
brief
northern
trip
the
colonel
called
at
treadwells
caroline
opened
the
door
treadwell
she
said
was
lying
down
miss
graciella
had
gone
over
to
a
neighbour
but
would
soon
return
miss
laura
was
paying
a
call
but
would
not
be
long
would
the
colonel
wait
no
he
said
he
would
take
a
walk
and
come
back
later
the
streets
were
shady
and
the
moonlight
bathed
with
a
silvery
glow
that
part
of
the
town
which
the
shadows
did
not
cover
strolling
aimlessly
along
the
quiet
unpaved
streets
the
colonel
upon
turning
a
corner
saw
a
lady
walking
a
short
distance
ahead
of
him
he
thought
he
recognised
the
figure
and
hurried
forward
but
ere
he
caught
up
with
her
she
turned
and
went
into
one
of
a
row
of
small
houses
which
he
knew
belonged
to
nichols
the
coloured
barber
and
were
occupied
by
coloured
people
thinking
he
had
been
mistaken
in
the
identity
he
slackened
his
pace
and
ere
he
had
passed
out
of
hearing
caught
the
tones
of
a
piano
accompanying
the
words
i
dreamt
that
i
dwelt
in
marble
halls
with
vassals
and
serfs
at
my
it
was
doubtless
the
barber
daughter
the
barber
was
the
only
coloured
family
in
town
that
owned
a
piano
in
the
moonlight
and
at
a
distance
of
some
rods
the
song
sounded
well
enough
and
the
colonel
lingered
until
it
ceased
and
the
player
began
to
practise
scales
when
he
continued
his
walk
he
had
smoked
a
couple
of
cigars
and
was
returning
toward
treadwells
when
he
met
face
to
face
miss
laura
treadwell
coming
out
of
the
barber
house
he
lifted
his
hat
and
put
out
his
hand
i
called
at
the
house
a
while
ago
and
you
were
all
out
i
was
just
going
back
i
walk
along
with
you
miss
laura
was
visibly
embarrassed
at
the
meeting
the
colonel
gave
no
sign
that
he
noticed
her
emotion
but
went
on
talking
it
is
a
delightful
evening
he
said
yes
she
replied
and
then
went
on
you
must
wonder
what
i
was
doing
there
i
suppose
he
said
that
you
were
looking
for
a
servant
or
on
some
mission
of
kindness
and
good
will
miss
laura
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
he
could
feel
her
hand
tremble
on
the
arm
he
offered
her
no
henry
she
said
why
should
i
deceive
you
i
did
not
go
to
find
a
servant
but
to
serve
i
have
told
you
we
were
poor
but
not
how
poor
i
can
tell
you
what
i
could
not
say
to
others
for
you
have
lived
away
from
here
and
i
know
how
differently
from
most
of
us
you
look
at
things
i
went
to
the
barber
house
to
give
the
daughter
music
lessons
for
money
the
colonel
laughed
contagiously
you
taught
her
to
sing
dreamt
that
i
dwelt
in
marble
halls
yes
but
you
must
not
judge
my
work
too
soon
she
replied
it
is
not
finished
yet
you
shall
let
me
know
when
it
is
done
he
said
and
i
will
walk
by
and
hear
the
finished
product
your
pupil
has
improved
wonderfully
i
heard
her
singing
the
song
the
day
i
came
back
the
first
time
i
walked
by
the
old
house
she
sings
it
much
better
now
you
are
a
good
teacher
as
well
as
a
good
woman
miss
laura
laughed
somewhat
excitedly
but
was
bent
upon
her
explanation
the
girl
used
to
come
to
the
house
she
said
her
mother
belonged
to
us
before
the
war
and
we
have
been
such
friends
as
white
and
black
can
be
and
she
wanted
to
learn
to
play
and
offered
to
pay
me
well
for
lessons
and
i
gave
them
to
her
we
never
speak
about
the
money
at
the
house
mother
knows
it
but
feigns
that
i
do
it
out
of
mere
kindness
and
tells
me
that
i
am
spoiling
the
coloured
people
our
friends
are
not
supposed
to
know
it
and
if
any
of
them
do
they
are
kind
and
never
speak
of
it
since
you
have
been
coming
to
the
house
it
has
not
been
convenient
to
teach
her
there
and
i
have
been
going
to
her
home
in
the
evening
my
dear
laura
said
the
colonel
remorsefully
i
have
driven
you
away
from
your
own
home
and
all
unwittingly
i
applaud
your
enterprise
and
your
public
spirit
it
is
a
long
way
from
the
banjo
to
the
piano
it
marks
the
progress
of
a
family
and
foreshadows
the
evolution
of
a
race
and
what
higher
work
than
to
elevate
humanity
they
had
reached
the
house
treadwell
had
not
come
down
nor
had
graciella
returned
they
went
into
the
parlour
miss
laura
turned
up
the
lamp
graciella
had
run
over
to
a
neighbour
to
meet
a
young
lady
who
was
visiting
a
young
lady
who
was
a
friend
of
graciella
she
had
remained
a
little
longer
than
she
had
meant
to
for
among
those
who
had
called
to
see
her
friend
friend
was
young
fetters
the
son
of
the
magnate
lately
returned
home
from
college
barclay
fetters
was
handsome
and
he
had
started
at
one
college
and
had
already
changed
to
two
others
stories
of
his
dissipated
habits
and
reckless
extravagance
had
been
bruited
about
graciella
knew
his
family
history
and
had
imbibed
the
notions
of
her
grandmother
household
so
that
her
acknowledgment
of
the
introduction
was
somewhat
cold
not
to
say
distant
but
as
she
felt
the
charm
of
his
manner
and
saw
that
the
other
girls
were
vieing
with
one
another
for
his
notice
she
felt
a
certain
triumph
that
he
exhibited
a
marked
preference
for
her
conversation
her
reserve
gradually
broke
down
and
she
was
talking
with
animation
and
listening
with
pleasure
when
she
suddenly
recollected
that
colonel
french
would
probably
call
and
that
she
ought
to
be
there
to
entertain
him
for
which
purpose
she
had
dressed
herself
very
carefully
he
had
not
spoken
yet
but
might
be
expected
to
speak
at
any
time
such
marked
attentions
as
his
could
have
but
one
meaning
and
for
several
days
she
had
had
a
premonition
that
before
the
week
was
out
he
would
seek
to
know
his
fate
and
graciella
meant
to
be
kind
anticipating
this
event
she
had
politely
but
pointedly
discouraged
ben
dudley
attentions
until
ben
pride
of
which
he
had
plenty
in
reserve
had
awaked
to
activity
at
their
last
meeting
he
had
demanded
a
definite
answer
to
his
question
graciella
he
had
said
are
you
going
to
marry
me
yes
or
no
not
be
played
with
any
longer
you
must
marry
me
for
myself
or
not
at
all
yes
or
no
then
no
dudley
she
had
replied
with
spirit
and
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
will
not
marry
you
i
will
never
marry
you
not
if
i
should
die
an
old
maid
she
was
sorry
they
had
not
parted
friends
but
she
was
not
to
blame
after
her
marriage
she
would
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
meeting
him
by
making
the
colonel
take
her
away
sometime
she
might
through
her
husband
be
of
service
to
ben
and
thus
make
up
in
part
at
least
for
his
disappointment
as
she
ran
up
through
the
garden
and
stepped
upon
the
porch
her
slippers
were
thin
and
made
no
sound
she
heard
colonel
french
voice
in
the
darkened
parlour
some
unusual
intonation
struck
her
and
she
moved
lightly
and
almost
mechanically
forward
in
the
shadow
toward
a
point
where
she
could
see
through
the
window
and
remain
screened
from
observation
so
intense
was
her
interest
in
what
she
heard
that
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
not
even
conscious
that
she
was
doing
a
shameful
thing
her
aunt
was
seated
and
colonel
french
was
standing
near
her
an
open
bible
lay
upon
the
table
the
colonel
had
taken
it
up
and
was
reading
can
find
a
virtuous
woman
for
her
price
is
far
above
rubies
the
heart
of
her
husband
doth
safely
trust
in
her
she
will
do
him
good
and
not
evil
all
the
days
of
her
life
strength
and
honour
are
her
clothing
and
she
shall
rejoice
in
time
to
come
laura
he
said
the
proverb
maker
was
a
prophet
as
well
in
these
words
written
four
thousand
years
ago
he
has
described
you
line
for
line
the
glow
which
warmed
her
cheek
still
smooth
the
light
which
came
into
her
clear
eyes
the
joy
that
filled
her
heart
at
these
kind
words
put
the
years
to
flight
and
for
the
moment
laura
was
young
again
you
have
been
good
to
phil
the
colonel
went
on
and
i
should
like
him
to
be
always
near
you
and
have
your
care
and
you
have
been
kind
to
me
and
made
me
welcome
and
at
home
in
what
might
otherwise
have
seemed
after
so
long
an
absence
a
strange
land
you
bring
back
to
me
the
best
of
my
youth
and
in
you
i
find
the
inspiration
for
good
deeds
be
my
wife
dear
laura
and
a
mother
to
my
boy
and
we
will
try
to
make
you
happy
oh
henry
she
cried
with
fluttering
heart
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
your
wife
i
know
nothing
of
the
world
where
you
have
lived
nor
whether
i
would
fit
into
it
you
are
worthy
of
any
place
he
declared
and
if
one
please
you
more
than
another
i
shall
make
your
wishes
mine
but
henry
how
could
i
leave
my
mother
and
graciella
needs
my
care
you
need
not
leave
your
mother
she
shall
be
mine
as
well
as
yours
graciella
is
a
dear
bright
child
she
has
in
her
the
making
of
a
noble
woman
she
should
be
sent
away
to
a
good
school
and
i
will
see
to
it
no
dear
laura
there
are
no
difficulties
no
giants
in
the
pathway
that
will
not
fly
or
fall
when
we
confront
them
he
had
put
his
arm
around
her
and
lifted
her
face
to
his
he
read
his
answer
in
her
swimming
eyes
and
when
he
had
reached
down
and
kissed
her
cheek
she
buried
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
shed
some
tears
of
happiness
for
this
was
her
secret
she
was
sweet
and
good
she
would
have
made
any
man
happy
who
had
been
worthy
of
her
but
no
man
had
ever
before
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
she
had
lived
upon
a
plane
so
simple
yet
so
high
that
men
not
equally
had
never
ventured
to
address
her
and
there
were
few
such
men
and
chance
had
not
led
them
her
way
as
to
the
others
perhaps
there
were
women
more
beautiful
and
certainly
more
enterprising
she
had
not
repined
she
had
been
busy
and
contented
now
this
great
happiness
was
vouchsafed
her
to
find
in
the
love
of
the
man
whom
she
admired
above
all
others
a
woman
true
career
henry
she
said
when
they
had
sat
down
on
the
old
sofa
side
by
side
you
have
made
me
very
happy
so
happy
that
i
wish
to
keep
my
happiness
all
to
myself
for
a
little
while
will
you
let
me
keep
our
engagement
secret
until
i
am
accustomed
to
it
it
may
be
silly
or
childish
but
it
seems
like
a
happy
dream
and
i
wish
to
assure
myself
of
its
reality
before
i
tell
it
to
anyone
else
to
me
said
the
colonel
smiling
tenderly
into
her
eyes
it
is
the
realisation
of
an
ideal
since
we
met
that
day
in
the
cemetery
you
have
seemed
to
me
the
embodiment
of
all
that
is
best
of
my
memories
of
the
old
south
and
your
gentleness
your
kindness
your
tender
grace
your
and
devotion
to
duty
mark
you
a
queen
among
women
and
my
heart
shall
be
your
throne
as
to
the
announcement
have
it
as
you
will
it
is
the
lady
privilege
you
are
very
good
she
said
tremulously
this
hour
repays
me
for
all
i
have
ever
tried
to
do
for
others
graciella
felt
very
young
indeed
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ten
she
put
it
afterward
when
she
reviewed
the
situation
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
as
she
crept
softly
away
from
the
window
and
around
the
house
to
the
back
door
and
up
the
stairs
and
into
her
own
chamber
where
all
oblivious
of
danger
to
her
clothes
or
her
complexion
she
threw
herself
down
upon
her
own
bed
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
she
had
been
cruelly
humiliated
colonel
french
whom
she
had
imagined
in
love
with
her
had
regarded
her
merely
as
a
child
who
ought
to
be
sent
to
school
to
acquire
what
she
asked
herself
good
sense
or
deportment
perhaps
she
might
acquire
more
good
sense
she
had
certainly
made
a
fool
of
herself
in
this
case
but
she
had
prided
herself
upon
her
manners
colonel
french
had
been
merely
playing
with
her
like
one
would
with
a
pet
monkey
and
he
had
been
in
love
all
the
time
with
her
aunt
laura
whom
the
girls
had
referred
to
compassionately
only
that
same
evening
as
a
hopeless
old
maid
it
is
fortunate
that
youth
and
hope
go
generally
hand
in
hand
graciella
possessed
a
buoyant
spirit
to
breast
the
waves
of
disappointment
she
had
her
cry
out
a
good
long
cry
and
when
much
weeping
had
dulled
the
edge
of
her
discomfiture
she
began
to
reflect
that
all
was
not
yet
lost
the
colonel
would
not
marry
her
but
he
would
still
marry
in
the
family
when
her
aunt
laura
became
french
she
would
doubtless
go
often
to
new
york
if
she
would
not
live
there
always
she
would
invite
graciella
to
go
with
her
perhaps
to
live
with
her
there
as
for
going
to
school
that
was
a
matter
which
her
own
views
should
control
at
present
she
had
no
wish
to
return
to
school
she
might
take
lessons
in
music
or
art
her
aunt
would
hardly
care
for
her
to
learn
stenography
now
or
go
into
magazine
work
her
aunt
would
surely
not
go
to
europe
without
inviting
her
and
colonel
french
was
very
liberal
with
his
money
and
would
deny
his
wife
nothing
though
graciella
could
hardly
imagine
that
any
man
would
be
infatuated
with
her
aunt
laura
but
this
was
not
the
end
of
graciella
troubles
graciella
had
a
heart
although
she
had
suppressed
its
promptings
under
the
influence
of
a
selfish
ambition
she
had
thrown
ben
dudley
over
for
the
colonel
the
colonel
did
not
want
her
and
now
she
would
have
neither
ben
had
been
very
angry
unreasonably
angry
she
had
thought
at
the
time
and
objectionably
rude
in
his
manner
he
had
sworn
never
to
speak
to
her
again
if
he
should
keep
his
word
she
might
be
very
unhappy
these
reflections
brought
on
another
rush
of
tears
and
a
very
penitent
contrite
young
woman
cried
herself
to
sleep
before
miss
laura
with
a
heart
bursting
with
happiness
bade
the
colonel
at
the
gate
and
went
upstairs
to
lie
awake
in
her
bed
in
a
turmoil
of
pleasant
emotions
miss
laura
happiness
lay
not
alone
in
the
prospect
that
colonel
french
would
marry
her
nor
in
any
sordid
thought
of
what
she
would
gain
by
becoming
the
wife
of
a
rich
man
it
rested
in
the
fact
that
this
man
whom
she
admired
and
who
had
come
back
from
the
outer
world
to
bring
fresh
ideas
new
and
larger
ideals
to
lift
and
broaden
and
revivify
the
town
had
passed
by
youth
and
beauty
and
vivacity
and
had
chosen
her
to
share
this
task
to
form
the
heart
and
mind
and
manners
of
his
child
and
to
be
the
tie
which
would
bind
him
most
strongly
to
her
dear
south
for
she
was
a
true
child
of
the
soil
the
people
about
her
white
and
black
were
her
people
and
this
marriage
with
its
larger
opportunities
for
usefulness
would
help
her
to
do
that
for
which
hitherto
she
had
only
been
able
to
pray
and
to
hope
to
the
boy
she
would
be
a
mother
indeed
to
lead
him
in
the
paths
of
truth
and
loyalty
and
manliness
and
the
fear
of
god
it
was
a
priceless
privilege
and
already
her
yearned
to
begin
the
task
and
then
after
the
flow
came
the
ebb
why
had
he
chosen
her
was
it
as
an
abstraction
the
embodiment
of
an
ideal
a
survival
from
a
host
of
pleasant
memories
and
as
a
mother
for
his
child
who
needed
care
which
no
one
else
could
give
and
as
a
helpmate
in
carrying
out
his
schemes
of
benevolence
were
these
his
only
motives
and
if
so
were
they
sufficient
to
ensure
her
happiness
was
he
marrying
her
through
a
mere
sentimental
impulse
or
for
calculated
convenience
or
from
both
she
must
be
certain
for
his
views
might
change
he
was
yet
in
the
full
flow
of
philanthropic
enthusiasm
she
shared
his
faith
in
human
nature
and
the
triumph
of
right
ideas
but
once
or
twice
she
had
feared
he
was
underrating
the
power
of
conservative
forces
that
he
had
been
away
from
clarendon
so
long
as
to
lose
the
perspective
of
actual
conditions
and
that
he
was
cherishing
expectations
which
might
be
disappointed
should
this
ever
prove
true
his
disillusion
might
be
as
and
as
sudden
as
his
enthusiasm
then
if
he
had
not
loved
her
for
herself
she
might
be
very
unhappy
she
would
have
rejoiced
to
bring
him
youth
and
beauty
and
the
things
for
which
other
women
were
preferred
she
would
have
loved
to
be
the
perfect
mate
one
in
heart
mind
soul
and
body
with
the
man
with
whom
she
was
to
share
the
journey
of
life
but
this
was
a
passing
thought
born
of
weakness
and
and
she
brushed
it
away
with
the
tear
that
had
come
with
it
and
smiled
at
its
absurdity
her
youth
was
past
with
nothing
to
expect
but
an
old
age
filled
with
the
small
expedients
of
genteel
poverty
there
had
opened
up
to
her
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
a
great
avenue
for
happiness
and
usefulness
it
was
foolish
with
so
much
to
be
grateful
for
to
sigh
for
the
unattainable
his
love
must
be
all
the
stronger
since
it
took
no
thought
of
things
which
others
would
have
found
of
controlling
importance
in
choosing
her
to
share
his
intellectual
life
he
had
paid
her
a
higher
compliment
than
had
he
praised
the
glow
of
her
cheek
or
the
contour
of
her
throat
in
confiding
phil
to
her
care
he
had
given
her
a
sacred
trust
and
confidence
for
she
knew
how
much
he
loved
the
child
the
colonel
schemes
for
the
improvement
of
clarendon
went
forward
with
occasional
setbacks
several
kilns
of
brick
turned
out
badly
so
that
the
brickyard
fell
behind
with
its
orders
thus
delaying
the
work
a
few
weeks
the
foundations
of
the
old
cotton
mill
had
been
substantially
laid
and
could
be
used
so
far
as
their
position
permitted
for
the
new
walls
when
the
bricks
were
ready
a
gang
of
masons
was
put
to
work
white
men
and
coloured
were
employed
under
a
white
foreman
so
great
was
the
demand
for
labour
and
so
stimulating
the
colonel
liberal
wage
that
even
the
drowsy
negroes
around
the
market
house
were
all
at
work
and
the
pigs
who
had
slept
near
them
were
obliged
to
bestir
themselves
to
keep
from
being
run
over
by
the
wagons
that
were
hauling
brick
and
lime
and
lumber
through
the
streets
even
the
cows
in
the
vacant
lot
between
the
and
the
bank
occasionally
lifted
up
their
gentle
eyes
as
though
wondering
what
strange
fever
possessed
the
creatures
around
them
urging
them
to
such
unnatural
activity
the
work
went
on
smoothly
for
a
week
or
two
when
the
colonel
had
some
words
with
jim
green
the
white
foreman
of
the
masons
the
cause
of
the
dispute
was
not
important
but
the
colonel
as
the
master
insisted
that
certain
work
should
be
done
in
a
certain
way
green
wished
to
argue
the
point
the
colonel
brought
the
discussion
to
a
close
with
a
peremptory
command
the
foreman
took
offense
declared
that
he
was
no
nigger
to
be
ordered
around
and
quit
the
colonel
promoted
to
the
vacancy
george
brown
a
coloured
man
who
was
the
next
best
workman
in
the
gang
on
the
day
when
brown
took
charge
of
the
job
the
white
bricklayers
of
whom
there
were
two
at
work
laid
down
their
tools
what
the
matter
asked
the
colonel
when
they
reported
for
their
pay
are
you
satisfied
with
the
wages
yes
we
got
no
fault
to
find
with
the
wages
well
we
wo
work
under
george
brown
we
do
mind
working
niggers
but
we
wo
work
a
nigger
i
sorry
gentlemen
but
i
must
hire
my
own
men
here
is
your
money
they
would
have
preferred
to
argue
their
grievance
and
since
the
colonel
had
shut
off
discussion
they
went
down
to
clay
saloon
and
argued
the
case
with
all
comers
with
the
usual
distortion
attending
argument
jim
green
had
been
superseded
by
a
nigger
this
was
the
burden
of
their
grievance
thus
came
the
thin
entering
wedge
that
was
to
separate
the
colonel
from
a
measure
of
his
popularity
there
had
been
no
objection
to
the
colonel
employing
negroes
no
objection
to
his
helping
their
school
if
he
chose
to
waste
his
money
that
way
but
there
were
many
who
took
offense
when
a
negro
was
preferred
to
a
white
man
through
caxton
the
colonel
learned
of
this
criticism
the
colonel
showed
no
surprise
and
no
annoyance
but
in
his
usual
way
replied
we
go
right
along
and
pay
no
attention
to
him
there
were
only
two
white
men
in
the
gang
and
they
have
never
worked
under
the
negro
they
quit
as
soon
as
i
promoted
him
i
have
hired
many
men
in
my
time
and
have
made
it
an
unvarying
rule
to
manage
my
own
business
in
my
own
way
if
anybody
says
anything
to
you
about
it
you
tell
them
just
that
these
people
have
got
to
learn
that
we
live
in
an
industrial
age
and
success
demands
of
an
employer
that
he
utilise
the
most
available
labour
after
green
was
discharged
george
brown
was
the
best
mason
left
he
gets
more
work
out
of
the
men
than
green
did
even
in
the
old
slave
times
negroes
made
the
best
of
overseers
they
knew
their
own
people
better
than
white
men
could
and
got
more
out
of
them
when
the
mill
is
completed
it
will
give
employment
to
five
hundred
white
women
and
fifty
white
men
but
every
dog
must
have
his
day
so
give
the
negro
his
the
colonel
attached
no
great
importance
to
the
incident
the
places
of
the
workmen
were
filled
and
the
work
went
forward
he
knew
the
southern
sensitiveness
and
viewed
it
with
a
tolerance
which
however
stopped
at
injustice
to
himself
or
others
the
very
root
of
his
reform
was
involved
in
the
proposition
to
discharge
a
competent
foreman
because
of
an
unreasonable
prejudice
matters
of
feeling
were
all
well
enough
in
some
respects
no
one
valued
more
highly
than
the
colonel
the
right
to
choose
his
own
associates
but
the
right
to
work
and
to
do
one
best
work
was
fundamental
as
was
the
right
to
have
one
work
done
by
those
who
could
do
it
best
even
a
healthy
social
instinct
might
be
perverted
into
an
unhealthy
and
unjust
prejudice
most
things
evil
were
the
perversion
of
good
the
feeling
with
which
the
colonel
thus
came
for
the
first
time
directly
in
contact
a
smouldering
fire
capable
always
of
being
fanned
into
flame
had
been
greatly
excited
by
the
political
campaign
which
began
about
the
third
month
after
his
arrival
in
clarendon
an
ambitious
politician
in
a
neighbouring
state
had
led
a
successful
campaign
on
the
issue
of
negro
disfranchisement
plainly
unconstitutional
it
was
declared
to
be
as
plainly
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
white
race
and
white
civilisation
the
example
had
proved
contagious
and
fetters
and
his
crowd
who
dominated
their
state
had
raised
the
issue
there
at
first
the
pronouncement
met
with
slight
response
the
sister
state
had
possessed
a
negro
majority
which
in
view
of
reconstruction
history
was
theoretically
capable
of
injuring
the
state
such
was
not
the
case
here
the
state
had
survived
reconstruction
with
small
injury
white
supremacy
existed
in
the
main
by
virtue
of
white
efficiency
as
compared
with
efficiency
of
a
lower
grade
there
had
been
places
and
instances
where
other
methods
had
been
occasionally
employed
to
suppress
the
negro
vote
but
taken
as
a
whole
the
supremacy
of
the
white
man
was
secure
no
negro
had
held
a
state
office
for
twenty
years
in
clarendon
they
had
even
ceased
to
be
summoned
as
jurors
and
when
a
negro
met
a
white
man
he
gave
him
the
wall
even
if
it
were
necessary
to
take
the
gutter
to
do
so
but
this
was
not
enough
this
supremacy
must
be
made
permanent
negroes
must
be
taught
that
they
need
never
look
for
any
different
state
of
things
new
definitions
were
given
to
old
words
new
pictures
set
in
old
frames
new
wine
poured
into
old
bottles
so
long
said
the
candidate
for
governor
when
he
spoke
at
clarendon
during
the
canvas
at
a
meeting
presided
over
by
the
editor
of
the
so
long
as
one
negro
votes
in
the
state
so
long
are
we
face
to
face
with
the
nightmare
of
negro
domination
for
example
suppose
a
difference
of
opinion
among
white
men
so
radical
as
to
divide
their
vote
equally
the
ballot
of
one
negro
would
determine
the
issue
can
such
a
possibility
be
contemplated
without
a
shudder
our
duty
to
ourselves
to
our
children
and
their
unborn
descendants
and
to
our
great
and
favoured
race
impels
us
to
protest
by
word
by
vote
by
arms
if
need
be
against
the
enforced
equality
of
an
inferior
race
equality
anywhere
means
ultimately
equality
everywhere
equality
at
the
polls
means
social
equality
social
equality
means
intermarriage
and
corruption
of
blood
and
degeneration
and
decay
what
gentleman
here
would
want
his
daughter
to
marry
a
nigger
there
could
be
but
one
answer
to
the
question
and
it
came
in
thunders
of
applause
colonel
french
heard
the
speech
smiled
at
the
old
arguments
but
felt
a
sudden
gravity
at
the
feeling
which
they
evoked
he
remembered
hearing
when
a
boy
the
same
arguments
they
had
served
their
purpose
once
before
with
other
issues
to
plunge
the
south
into
war
and
consequent
disaster
had
the
lesson
been
in
vain
he
did
not
see
the
justice
nor
the
expediency
of
the
proposed
agitation
but
he
was
not
in
politics
and
confined
his
protests
to
argument
with
his
friends
who
listened
but
were
not
convinced
behind
closed
doors
more
than
one
of
the
prominent
citizens
admitted
that
the
campaign
was
all
wrong
that
the
issues
were
unjust
and
reactionary
and
that
the
best
interests
of
the
state
lay
in
uplifting
every
element
of
the
people
rather
than
selecting
some
one
class
for
discouragement
and
degradation
and
that
the
white
race
could
hold
its
own
with
the
negroes
or
against
them
in
any
conceivable
state
of
political
equality
they
listened
to
the
colonel
quiet
argument
that
no
state
could
be
freer
or
greater
or
more
enlightened
than
the
average
of
its
citizenship
and
that
any
restriction
of
rights
that
rested
upon
anything
but
impartial
justice
was
bound
to
as
slavery
had
done
upon
the
prosperity
and
progress
of
the
state
they
listened
which
the
colonel
regarded
as
a
great
point
gained
and
they
agreed
in
part
and
he
could
almost
understand
why
they
let
their
feelings
govern
their
reason
and
their
judgment
and
said
no
word
to
prevent
an
unfair
and
unconstitutional
scheme
from
going
forward
to
a
successful
issue
he
knew
that
for
a
white
man
to
declare
in
such
a
community
for
equal
rights
or
equal
justice
for
the
negro
or
to
take
the
negro
side
in
any
case
where
the
race
issue
was
raised
was
to
court
social
ostracism
and
political
death
or
if
the
feeling
provoked
were
strong
enough
an
even
more
complete
form
of
extinction
so
the
colonel
was
patient
and
meant
to
be
prudent
his
own
arguments
avoided
the
stirring
up
of
prejudice
and
were
directed
to
the
higher
motives
and
deeper
principles
which
underlie
society
in
the
light
of
which
humanity
is
more
than
race
and
the
welfare
of
the
state
above
that
of
any
man
or
set
of
men
within
it
it
being
an
axiom
as
true
in
statesmanship
as
in
mathematics
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
any
one
of
its
parts
content
to
await
the
uplifting
power
of
industry
and
enlightenment
and
supremely
confident
of
the
result
the
colonel
went
serenely
forward
in
his
work
of
sowing
that
others
might
reap
the
atmosphere
of
the
treadwell
home
was
charged
for
the
next
few
days
with
electric
currents
graciella
knew
that
her
aunt
was
engaged
to
colonel
french
but
she
had
not
waited
the
night
before
to
hear
her
aunt
express
the
wish
that
the
engagement
should
be
kept
secret
she
was
therefore
bursting
with
information
of
which
she
could
manifest
no
consciousness
without
confessing
that
she
had
been
eavesdropping
a
thing
which
she
knew
miss
laura
regarded
as
detestably
immoral
she
wondered
at
her
aunt
silence
except
a
certain
subdued
air
of
happiness
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
miss
laura
calm
demeanor
from
that
of
any
other
day
graciella
had
determined
upon
her
own
attitude
toward
her
aunt
she
would
kiss
her
and
wish
her
happiness
and
give
no
sign
that
any
thought
of
colonel
french
had
ever
entered
her
own
mind
but
this
little
drama
rehearsed
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
went
unacted
since
the
curtain
did
not
rise
upon
the
stage
the
colonel
came
and
went
as
usual
some
dissimulation
was
required
on
graciella
part
to
preserve
her
usual
manner
toward
him
she
may
have
been
to
blame
in
taking
the
colonel
attentions
as
intended
for
herself
she
would
not
soon
forgive
his
slighting
reference
to
her
in
his
eyes
she
had
been
only
a
child
who
ought
to
go
to
school
he
had
been
good
enough
to
say
that
she
had
the
making
of
a
fine
woman
thanks
she
had
had
a
lover
for
at
least
two
years
and
a
proposal
of
marriage
before
colonel
french
shadow
had
fallen
athwart
her
life
she
wished
her
aunt
laura
happiness
no
one
could
deserve
it
more
but
was
it
possible
to
be
happy
with
a
man
so
lacking
in
taste
and
judgment
her
aunt
secret
began
to
weigh
upon
her
mind
and
she
effaced
herself
as
much
as
possible
when
the
colonel
came
her
grandmother
had
begun
to
notice
this
and
comment
upon
it
when
the
happening
of
a
certain
social
event
created
a
diversion
this
was
the
annual
entertainment
known
as
the
assembly
ball
it
was
usually
held
later
in
the
year
but
owing
to
the
presence
of
several
young
lady
visitors
in
the
town
it
had
been
decided
to
give
it
early
in
the
fall
the
affair
was
in
the
hands
of
a
committee
by
whom
invitations
were
sent
to
most
people
in
the
county
who
had
any
claims
to
gentility
the
gentlemen
accepting
were
expected
to
subscribe
to
the
funds
for
hall
rent
music
and
refreshments
these
were
always
the
best
the
town
afforded
the
ball
was
held
in
the
opera
house
a
rather
euphemistic
title
for
the
large
hall
above
barstow
cotton
warehouse
where
theatrical
companies
played
stands
several
times
during
the
winter
and
where
an
occasional
lecturer
or
conjurer
held
forth
an
amateur
performance
of
pinafore
had
once
been
given
there
henry
grady
had
lectured
there
upon
white
supremacy
the
reverend
sam
small
had
preached
there
on
hell
it
was
also
distinguished
as
having
been
refused
even
at
the
request
of
the
state
commissioner
of
education
as
a
place
for
booker
washington
to
deliver
an
address
which
had
been
given
at
the
town
hall
instead
the
assembly
balls
had
always
been
held
in
the
opera
house
in
former
years
the
music
had
been
furnished
by
local
negro
musicians
but
there
were
no
longer
any
of
these
and
a
band
of
string
music
was
brought
in
from
another
town
so
far
as
mere
wealth
was
concerned
the
subscribers
touched
such
extremes
as
ben
dudley
on
the
one
hand
and
colonel
french
on
the
other
and
included
barclay
fetters
whom
graciella
had
met
on
the
evening
before
her
disappointment
the
treadwell
ladies
were
of
course
invited
and
the
question
of
ways
and
means
became
paramount
new
gowns
and
other
accessories
were
imperative
miss
laura
one
party
dress
had
done
service
until
it
was
past
redemption
and
this
was
graciella
first
assembly
ball
miss
laura
took
stock
of
the
family
resources
and
found
that
she
could
afford
only
one
gown
this
of
course
must
be
graciella
her
own
marriage
would
entail
certain
expenses
which
demanded
some
present
she
had
played
for
several
years
but
now
that
she
was
sure
of
a
partner
it
was
a
real
sacrifice
not
to
attend
the
ball
but
graciella
was
young
and
in
such
matters
youth
has
a
prior
right
for
she
had
yet
to
find
her
mate
graciella
magnanimously
offered
to
remain
at
home
but
was
easily
prevailed
upon
to
go
she
was
not
entirely
happy
for
the
humiliating
failure
of
her
hopes
had
left
her
for
the
moment
without
a
recognised
admirer
and
the
fear
of
old
maidenhood
had
again
laid
hold
of
her
heart
her
aunt
laura
case
was
no
consoling
example
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
would
choose
a
wife
for
colonel
french
reasons
most
men
married
for
beauty
and
graciella
had
been
told
that
beauty
that
matured
early
like
her
own
was
likely
to
fade
early
one
humiliation
she
was
spared
she
had
been
as
silent
about
her
hopes
as
miss
laura
was
about
her
engagement
whether
this
was
due
to
mere
prudence
or
to
vanity
the
hope
of
astonishing
her
little
world
by
the
unexpected
announcement
did
not
change
the
comforting
fact
that
she
had
nothing
to
explain
and
nothing
for
which
to
be
pitied
if
her
friends
after
the
manner
of
young
ladies
had
hinted
at
the
subject
and
sought
to
find
a
meaning
in
colonel
french
friendship
she
had
smiled
enigmatically
for
this
whatever
had
been
its
motive
she
now
reaped
her
reward
the
announcement
of
her
engagement
would
account
for
the
colonel
attentions
to
graciella
as
a
mere
courtesy
to
a
young
relative
of
his
affianced
with
regard
to
ben
graciella
was
quite
uneasy
she
had
met
him
only
once
since
their
quarrel
and
had
meant
to
bow
to
him
politely
but
with
dignity
to
show
that
she
bore
no
malice
but
he
had
ostentatiously
avoided
her
glance
if
he
chose
to
be
she
had
thought
and
preferred
her
enmity
to
her
friendship
her
conscience
was
at
least
clear
she
had
been
willing
to
forget
his
rudeness
and
be
a
friend
to
him
she
could
have
been
his
true
friend
if
nothing
more
and
he
would
need
friends
unless
he
changed
a
great
deal
when
her
mental
atmosphere
was
cleared
by
the
fading
of
her
dream
ben
assumed
larger
proportions
perhaps
he
had
had
cause
for
complaint
at
least
it
was
only
just
to
admit
that
he
thought
so
nor
had
he
suffered
in
her
estimation
by
his
display
of
spirit
in
not
waiting
to
be
jilted
but
in
forcing
her
hand
before
she
was
quite
ready
to
play
it
she
could
scarcely
expect
him
to
attend
her
to
the
ball
but
he
was
among
the
subscribers
and
could
hardly
avoid
meeting
her
or
dancing
with
her
without
pointed
rudeness
if
he
did
not
ask
her
to
dance
then
either
the
virginia
reel
or
the
lancers
or
quadrilles
would
surely
bring
them
together
and
though
graciella
sighed
she
did
not
despair
she
could
of
course
allay
his
jealousy
at
once
by
telling
him
of
her
aunt
laura
engagement
but
this
was
not
yet
practicable
she
must
find
some
other
way
of
placating
him
ben
dudley
also
had
a
problem
to
face
in
reference
to
the
ball
a
problem
which
has
troubled
impecunious
youth
since
balls
were
invented
the
problem
of
clothes
he
was
not
obliged
to
go
to
the
ball
graciella
outrageous
conduct
relieved
him
of
any
obligation
to
invite
her
and
there
was
no
other
woman
with
whom
he
would
have
cared
to
go
or
who
would
have
cared
so
far
as
he
knew
to
go
with
him
for
he
was
not
a
lady
man
and
but
for
his
distant
relationship
would
probably
never
have
gone
to
the
treadwells
he
was
looked
upon
by
young
women
as
slow
and
he
knew
that
graciella
had
often
been
impatient
at
his
lack
of
sprightliness
he
could
pay
his
subscription
which
was
really
a
sort
of
gentility
tax
the
failure
to
meet
which
would
merely
forfeit
future
invitations
and
remain
at
home
he
did
not
own
a
dress
suit
nor
had
he
the
money
to
spare
for
one
he
or
they
for
he
and
his
uncle
were
one
in
such
matters
were
in
debt
already
up
to
the
limit
of
their
credit
and
he
had
sold
the
last
bale
of
old
cotton
to
pay
the
last
month
expenses
while
the
new
crop
already
partly
mortgaged
was
not
yet
picked
he
knew
that
some
young
fellows
in
town
rented
dress
suits
from
solomon
cohen
who
though
he
kept
only
four
suits
in
stock
at
a
time
would
send
to
new
york
for
others
to
rent
out
on
this
occasion
and
return
them
afterwards
but
ben
would
not
wear
another
man
clothes
he
had
borne
insults
from
graciella
that
he
never
would
have
borne
from
any
one
else
and
that
he
would
never
bear
again
but
there
were
things
at
which
his
soul
protested
nor
would
cohen
suits
have
fitted
him
he
was
so
much
taller
than
the
average
man
for
whom
store
clothes
were
made
he
remained
in
a
state
of
indecision
until
the
day
of
the
ball
late
in
the
evening
he
put
on
his
black
cutaway
coat
which
was
getting
a
little
small
trousers
to
match
and
a
white
waistcoat
and
started
to
town
on
horseback
so
as
to
arrive
in
time
for
the
ball
in
case
he
should
decide
at
the
last
moment
to
take
part
the
opera
house
was
brilliantly
lighted
on
the
night
of
the
assembly
ball
the
dancers
gathered
at
an
earlier
hour
than
is
the
rule
in
the
large
cities
many
of
the
guests
came
in
from
the
country
and
returned
home
after
the
ball
since
the
hotel
could
accommodate
only
a
part
of
them
when
ben
dudley
having
left
his
horse
at
a
livery
stable
walked
up
main
street
toward
the
hall
carriages
were
arriving
and
discharging
their
freight
the
ladies
were
prettily
gowned
their
faces
were
bright
and
animated
and
ben
observed
that
most
of
the
gentlemen
wore
dress
suits
but
also
much
to
his
relief
that
a
number
sufficient
to
make
at
least
a
respectable
minority
did
not
he
was
rapidly
making
up
his
mind
to
enter
when
colonel
french
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
dashing
bays
and
driven
by
a
negro
in
livery
dashed
up
to
the
door
and
discharged
miss
graciella
treadwell
radiantly
beautiful
in
a
new
pink
gown
with
pink
flowers
in
her
hair
a
thin
gold
chain
with
a
gold
locket
at
the
end
around
her
slender
throat
white
slippers
on
her
feet
and
long
white
gloves
upon
her
shapely
hands
and
wrists
ben
shrank
back
into
the
shadow
he
had
never
been
of
an
envious
disposition
he
had
always
looked
upon
envy
as
a
mean
vice
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
but
for
a
moment
something
very
like
envy
pulled
at
his
heartstrings
graciella
worshipped
the
golden
calf
worshipped
graciella
but
he
had
no
money
he
could
not
have
taken
her
to
the
ball
in
a
closed
carriage
drawn
by
blooded
horses
and
driven
by
a
darky
in
livery
graciella
cavalier
wore
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
long
habit
an
evening
suit
of
some
fine
black
stuff
that
almost
shone
in
the
light
from
the
open
door
at
the
sight
of
him
the
waist
of
ben
own
coat
shrunk
up
to
the
and
he
felt
a
sinking
of
the
heart
as
they
passed
out
of
his
range
of
vision
he
would
not
appear
to
advantage
by
the
side
of
colonel
french
and
he
would
not
care
to
appear
otherwise
than
to
advantage
in
graciella
eyes
he
would
not
like
to
make
more
palpable
by
contrast
the
difference
between
colonel
french
and
himself
nor
could
he
be
haughty
distant
reproachful
or
anything
but
painfully
in
a
coat
that
was
not
of
the
proper
cut
too
short
in
the
sleeves
and
too
tight
under
the
arms
while
he
stood
thus
communing
with
his
own
bitter
thoughts
another
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
beautiful
black
horses
drew
up
to
the
curb
in
front
of
him
the
horses
were
restive
and
not
inclined
to
stand
still
some
one
from
the
inside
of
the
carriage
called
to
the
coachman
through
the
open
window
ransom
said
the
voice
stay
on
the
box
here
you
open
this
carriage
door
ben
looked
around
for
the
person
addressed
but
saw
no
one
near
but
himself
you
boy
there
by
the
curb
open
this
door
will
you
or
hold
the
horses
so
my
coachman
can
are
you
speaking
to
me
demanded
ben
angrily
just
then
one
of
the
of
the
carriage
flashed
on
face
oh
i
beg
pardon
said
the
man
in
the
carriage
carelessly
i
took
you
for
a
nigger
there
could
be
no
more
deadly
insult
though
the
mistake
was
not
unnatural
ben
was
dark
and
the
shadow
made
him
darker
ben
was
furious
the
stranger
had
uttered
words
of
apology
but
his
tone
had
been
insolent
and
his
apology
was
more
offensive
than
his
original
blunder
had
it
not
been
for
ben
reluctance
to
make
a
disturbance
he
would
have
struck
the
offender
in
the
mouth
if
he
had
had
a
pistol
he
could
have
shot
him
his
great
uncle
ralph
for
instance
would
not
have
let
him
live
an
hour
while
these
thoughts
were
surging
through
his
heated
brain
the
young
man
as
immaculately
clad
as
colonel
french
had
been
left
the
carriage
from
which
he
helped
a
lady
and
with
her
upon
his
arm
entered
the
hall
in
the
light
that
streamed
from
the
doorway
ben
recognised
him
as
barclay
fetters
who
having
finished
a
checkered
scholastic
career
had
been
at
home
at
sycamore
for
several
months
much
of
this
time
he
had
spent
in
clarendon
where
his
father
wealth
and
influence
gave
him
entrance
to
good
society
in
spite
of
an
ancestry
which
mere
character
would
not
have
offset
he
knew
young
fetters
very
well
by
sight
since
the
latter
had
to
pass
mink
run
whenever
he
came
to
town
from
sycamore
fetters
may
not
have
known
him
since
he
had
been
away
for
much
of
the
time
in
recent
years
but
he
ought
to
have
been
able
to
distinguish
between
a
white
man
a
gentleman
and
a
negro
it
was
the
insolence
of
an
upstart
old
josh
fetters
had
been
in
his
younger
days
his
uncle
overseer
an
overseer
grandson
treated
him
ben
dudley
like
dirt
under
his
feet
perhaps
he
had
judged
him
by
his
clothes
he
would
like
to
show
barclay
fetters
if
they
ever
stood
face
to
face
that
clothes
did
not
make
the
man
nor
the
gentleman
ben
decided
after
this
encounter
that
he
would
not
go
on
the
floor
of
the
ballroom
but
unable
to
tear
himself
away
he
waited
until
everybody
seemed
to
have
gone
in
then
went
up
the
stairs
and
gained
access
by
a
back
way
to
a
dark
gallery
in
the
rear
of
the
hall
which
the
ushers
had
deserted
for
the
ballroom
from
which
he
could
without
discovery
look
down
upon
the
scene
below
his
eyes
flew
to
graciella
as
the
needle
to
the
pole
she
was
dancing
with
colonel
french
the
music
stopped
and
a
crowd
of
young
fellows
surrounded
her
when
the
next
dance
which
was
a
waltz
began
she
moved
out
upon
the
floor
in
the
arms
of
barclay
fetters
ben
swore
beneath
his
breath
he
had
heard
tales
of
barclay
fetters
which
if
true
made
him
unfit
to
touch
a
decent
woman
he
left
the
hall
walked
a
short
distance
down
a
street
and
around
the
corner
to
the
bar
in
the
rear
of
the
hotel
where
he
ordered
a
glass
of
whiskey
he
had
never
been
drunk
in
his
life
and
detested
the
taste
of
liquor
but
he
was
desperate
and
had
to
do
something
he
would
drink
till
he
was
drunk
and
forget
his
troubles
having
never
been
intoxicated
he
had
no
idea
whatever
of
the
effect
liquor
would
have
upon
him
with
each
succeeding
drink
the
sense
of
his
wrongs
broadened
and
deepened
at
one
stage
his
intoxication
took
the
form
of
an
intense
there
was
something
rotten
in
the
whole
scheme
of
things
why
should
he
be
poor
while
others
were
rich
and
while
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
were
hidden
in
or
around
the
house
where
he
lived
why
should
colonel
french
an
old
man
who
was
of
no
better
blood
than
himself
be
rich
enough
to
rob
him
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
why
above
all
should
barclay
fetters
have
education
and
money
and
every
kind
of
opportunity
which
he
did
not
appreciate
while
he
who
would
have
made
good
use
of
them
had
nothing
with
this
sense
of
wrong
which
grew
as
his
brain
clouded
more
and
more
there
came
side
by
side
a
vague
zeal
to
right
these
wrongs
as
he
grew
drunker
still
his
thoughts
grew
less
coherent
he
lost
sight
of
his
special
grievance
and
merely
retained
the
combative
instinct
he
had
reached
this
dangerous
stage
and
had
fortunately
passed
it
one
step
farther
along
the
road
to
unconsciousness
fortunately
because
had
he
been
sober
the
result
of
that
which
was
to
follow
might
have
been
more
serious
when
two
young
men
who
had
come
down
from
the
ballroom
for
some
refreshment
entered
the
barroom
and
asked
for
cocktails
while
the
barkeeper
was
compounding
the
liquor
the
young
men
spoke
of
the
ball
that
little
treadwell
girl
is
a
peach
said
one
i
could
tote
a
bunch
of
beauty
like
that
around
the
ballroom
all
night
the
remark
was
not
exactly
respectful
nor
yet
exactly
disrespectful
ben
looked
up
from
his
seat
the
speaker
was
barclay
fetters
and
his
companion
one
tom
mcrae
another
dissolute
young
man
of
the
town
ben
got
up
unsteadily
and
walked
over
to
where
they
stood
i
want
you
to
he
said
thickly
that
no
would

in
a
place
like
this
or
shpeak
dissuspeckerly

hell

returned
fetters
a
scowl
of
surprise
rose
on
his
handsome
face
and
he
sprang
to
an
attitude
of
defence
ben
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
struck
at
fetters
but
ben
was
drunk
and
the
other
two
were
sober
and
in
three
minutes
ben
lay
on
the
floor
with
a
sore
head
and
a
black
eye
his
nose
was
bleeding
copiously
and
the
crimson
stream
had
run
down
upon
his
white
shirt
and
vest
taken
all
in
all
his
appearance
was
most
disreputable
by
this
time
the
liquor
he
had
drunk
had
its
full
effect
and
complete
unconsciousness
supervened
to
save
him
for
a
little
while
from
the
realisation
of
his
disgrace
who
is
the
mucker
anyway
asked
barclay
fetters
readjusting
his
cuffs
which
had
slipped
down
in
the
melee
he
a
chap
by
the
name
of
dudley

let
hurry
back

or
we
lose
the
next
dance
fetters
and
his
companion
returned
to
the
ball
the
barkeeper
called
a
servant
of
the
hotel
with
whose
aid
ben
was
carried
upstairs
and
put
to
bed
bruised
in
body
and
damaged
in
reputation
ben
fight
with
young
fetters
became
a
matter
of
public
comment
the
next
day
after
the
ball
his
conduct
was
cited
as
sad
proof
of
the
degeneracy
of
a
once
fine
old
family
he
had
been
considered
shiftless
and
not
well
educated
but
no
one
had
suspected
that
he
was
a
drunkard
and
a
rowdy
other
young
men
in
the
town
young
fellows
with
plenty
of
money
sometimes
drank
a
little
too
much
and
occasionally
for
a
point
of
honour
gentlemen
were
obliged
to
attack
or
defend
themselves
but
when
they
did
they
used
pistols
a
gentleman
weapon
here
however
was
an
unprovoked
and
brutal
attack
with
fists
upon
two
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
and
without
weapons
to
defend
themselves
one
of
them
said
the
the
son
of
our
distinguished
fellow
citizen
and
colleague
in
the
legislature
the
honourable
william
fetters
when
colonel
french
called
to
see
miss
laura
the
afternoon
of
next
day
after
the
ball
the
ladies
were
much
concerned
about
the
affair
oh
henry
exclaimed
miss
laura
what
is
this
dreadful
story
about
ben
dudley
they
say
he
was
drinking
at
the
hotel
and
became
intoxicated
and
that
when
barclay
fetters
and
tom
mcrae
went
into
the
hotel
he
said
something
insulting
about
graciella
and
when
they
rebuked
him
for
his
freedom
he
attacked
them
violently
and
that
when
finally
subdued
he
was
put
to
bed
unconscious
and
disgracefully
intoxicated
graciella
is
very
angry
and
we
all
feel
ashamed
enough
to
sink
into
the
ground
what
can
be
the
matter
with
ben
he
been
around
lately
and
he
has
quarrelled
with
graciella
i
never
would
have
expected
anything
like
this
from
ben
it
came
from
his
ralph
said
treadwell
ralph
was
very
wild
when
he
was
young
but
settled
down
into
a
very
polished
gentleman
i
danced
with
him
once
when
he
was
drunk
and
i
never
knew
it
it
was
my
first
ball
and
i
was
intoxicated
myself
with
excitement
mother
was
scandalised
but
father
laughed
and
said
boys
would
be
boys
but
poor
ben
has
had
his
uncle
chances
and
while
he
has
always
behaved
well
here
he
could
hardly
be
expected
to
carry
his
liquor
like
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
my
dear
ladies
said
the
colonel
we
have
heard
only
one
side
of
the
story
i
guess
there
no
doubt
ben
was
intoxicated
but
we
know
he
is
a
drinking
man
and
one
drink
or
even
one
drunk
make
a
drunkard
nor
one
fight
a
rowdy
barclay
fetters
and
tom
mcrae
are
not
immaculate
and
perhaps
ben
can
exonerate
himself
i
certainly
hope
so
said
miss
laura
earnestly
i
am
sorry
for
ben
but
i
could
not
permit
a
drunken
rowdy
to
come
to
the
house
or
let
my
niece
be
seen
upon
the
street
with
him
it
would
only
be
fair
said
the
colonel
to
give
him
a
chance
to
explain
when
he
comes
in
again
i
rather
like
ben
he
has
some
fine
mechanical
ideas
and
the
making
of
a
man
in
him
unless
i
am
mistaken
i
have
been
hoping
to
find
a
place
for
him
in
the
new
cotton
mill
when
it
is
ready
to
run
they
were
still
speaking
of
ben
when
there
was
an
irresolute
knock
at
the
rear
door
of
the
parlour
in
which
they
were
seated
miss
laura

ef

sen
back
any
mo
catharine
had
put
her
apron
to
her
eyes
and
was
sobbing
bitterly
the
story
was
probably
true
the
colonel
had
heard
underground
rumours
about
the
fetters
plantation
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
supplied
with
labourers
and
his
own
experience
in
old
peter
case
had
made
them
seem
not
unlikely
he
had
seen
catharine
husband
in
the
justice
court
and
the
next
day
in
the
convict
gang
behind
buggy
the
man
had
not
looked
like
a
criminal
that
he
was
surly
and
desperate
may
as
well
have
been
due
to
a
sense
of
rank
injustice
as
to
an
evil
nature
that
a
wrong
had
been
done
under
cover
of
law
was
at
least
more
than
likely
but
a
deed
of
mercy
could
be
made
to
right
it
the
love
of
money
might
be
the
root
of
all
evil
but
its
control
was
certainly
a
means
of
great
good
the
colonel
glowed
with
the
consciousness
of
this
beneficent
power
to
scatter
happiness
laura
he
said
i
will
attend
to
this
it
is
a
matter
about
which
you
should
not
be
troubled
do
be
alarmed
catharine
just
be
a
good
girl
and
help
miss
laura
all
you
can
and
i
look
after
your
husband
and
pay
his
fine
and
let
him
work
it
out
as
a
free
man
suh
mars

an

suh
you
an
my
sweet
young
lady
fuh
bein
good
to

folks

nuthin
to
out
er
trouble
said
catharine
backing
out
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
on
leaving
miss
laura
the
colonel
went
round
to
the
office
of
squire
reddick
the
justice
of
the
peace
to
inquire
into
the
matter
of
bud
johnson
the
justice
was
out
of
town
his
clerk
said
but
would
be
in
his
office
at
nine
in
the
morning
at
which
time
the
colonel
could
speak
to
him
about
johnson
fine
the
next
morning
was
bright
and
clear
and
cool
enough
to
be
bracing
the
colonel
alive
with
pleasant
thoughts
rose
early
and
after
a
cold
bath
and
a
leisurely
breakfast
walked
over
to
the
mill
site
where
the
men
were
already
at
work
having
looked
the
work
over
and
given
certain
directions
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
finding
it
near
nine
set
out
for
the
justice
office
in
time
to
reach
it
by
the
appointed
hour
squire
reddick
was
at
his
desk
upon
which
his
feet
rested
while
he
read
a
newspaper
he
looked
up
with
an
air
of
surprise
as
the
colonel
entered
why
good
mornin
colonel
french
he
said
genially
i
kind
of
expected
you
a
while
ago
the
clerk
said
you
might
be
around
but
you
didn
come
so
i
supposed
you
changed
yo
mind
the
clerk
said
that
you
would
be
here
at
nine
replied
the
colonel
it
is
only
just
nine
did
he
well
now
that
too
bad
i
do
generally
git
around
about
nine
but
i
was
earlier
this
mornin
and
as
everybody
was
here
we
started
in
a
little
sooner
than
usual
you
wanted
to
see
me
about
bud
johnson
yes
i
wish
to
pay
his
fine
and
give
him
work
well
that
too
bad
but
you
were
here
and
turner
was
and
he
bought
his
time
again
for
fetters
i
sorry
you
know
but
first
come
first
served
the
colonel
was
seriously
annoyed
he
did
not
like
to
believe
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
frustrate
his
good
intention
but
that
result
had
been
accomplished
whether
by
accident
or
design
he
had
failed
in
the
first
thing
he
had
undertaken
for
the
woman
he
loved
and
was
to
marry
he
would
see
fetters
man
however
and
come
to
some
arrangement
with
him
with
fetters
the
hiring
of
the
negro
was
purely
a
commercial
transaction
conditioned
upon
a
probable
profit
for
the
immediate
payment
of
which
and
a
liberal
bonus
he
would
doubtless
relinquish
his
claim
upon
johnson
services
learning
that
turner
who
had
acted
as
fetters
agent
in
the
matter
had
gone
over
to
clay
johnson
saloon
he
went
to
seek
him
there
he
found
him
and
asked
for
a
proposition
turner
heard
him
out
well
colonel
french
he
replied
with
slightly
veiled
insolence
i
bought
this
nigger
time
for
fetters
an
unless
i
mistaken
in
fetters
no
amount
of
money
can
get
the
nigger
until
he
served
his
time
out
he
defied
our
rules
and
defied
the
law
and
defied
me
and
assaulted
one
of
the
guards
and
he
ought
to
be
made
an
example
of
we
want
to
keep
he
a
bad
nigger
an
got
to
handle
a
lot
of
an
we
need
for
an
example
he
keeps
us
in
trainin
have
you
any
power
in
the
matter
demanded
the
colonel
restraining
his
contempt
me
no
not
i
could
let
the
nigger
go
for
his
weight
in
gol
an
wouldn
if
i
could
i
bought
in
for
fetters
he
the
only
man
that
got
any
say
about
very
well
said
the
colonel
as
he
turned
away
i
see
fetters
i
do
know
whether
you
will
or
not
said
turner
to
himself
as
he
shot
a
vindictive
glance
at
the
colonel
retreating
figure
fetters
has
got
this
county
where
he
wants
it
an
i
bet
dollars
to
bird
shot
he
ai
goin
to
let
no
interloper
come
down
here
an
mix
up
with
his
arrangements
even
if
he
did
hail
from
this
town
way
back
yonder
this
here
nigger
problem
is
a
problem
and
outsiders
might
well
keep
their
han
off
me
and
haines
an
fetters
is
the
kind
o
men
to
settle
it
the
colonel
was
obliged
to
confess
to
miss
laura
his
temporary
setback
which
he
went
around
to
the
house
and
did
immediately
it
the
first
thing
i
undertaken
yet
for
your
sake
laura
and
i
got
to
report
failure
so
far
it
only
the
first
step
she
said
consolingly
that
all
i
drive
out
to
fetters
place
and
arrange
the
matter
by
starting
before
day
i
can
make
it
and
transact
my
business
and
get
back
by
night
without
hurting
the
horses
catharine
was
called
in
and
the
situation
explained
to
her
though
clearly
disappointed
at
the
delay
and
not
yet
free
of
apprehension
that
bud
might
do
something
rash
she
seemed
serenely
confident
of
the
colonel
ultimate
success
in
her
simple
creed
god
might
sometimes
seem
to
neglect
his
black
children
but
no
harm
could
come
to
a
negro
who
had
a
rich
white
gentleman
for
friend
and
protector
it
was
not
yet
sunrise
when
the
colonel
set
out
next
day
after
an
early
breakfast
upon
his
visit
to
fetters
there
was
a
crisp
freshness
in
the
air
the
dew
was
thick
upon
the
grass
the
clear
blue
sky
gave
promise
of
a
bright
day
and
a
pleasant
journey
the
plantation
conducted
by
fetters
lay
about
twenty
miles
to
the
south
of
clarendon
and
remote
from
any
railroad
a
convenient
location
for
such
an
establishment
for
railroads
while
they
bring
in
supplies
and
take
out
produce
also
bring
in
light
and
take
out
information
both
of
which
are
fatal
to
certain
fungus
growths
social
as
well
as
vegetable
which
flourish
best
in
the
dark
the
road
led
by
mink
run
and
the
colonel
looked
over
toward
the
house
as
they
passed
it
old
and
it
seemed
even
in
the
distance
which
lent
it
no
enchantment
in
the
bright
morning
light
when
the
colonel
had
travelled
that
road
in
his
boyhood
great
forests
of
primeval
pine
had
stretched
for
miles
on
either
hand
broken
at
intervals
by
thriving
plantations
now
all
was
changed
the
tall
and
stately
growth
of
the
pine
had
well
nigh
disappeared
fifteen
years
before
the
turpentine
industry
moving
southward
from
virginia
along
the
upland
counties
of
the
appalachian
slope
had
swept
through
clarendon
county
leaving
behind
it
a
trail
of
blasted
trunks
and
abandoned
stills
ere
these
had
yielded
to
decay
the
sawmill
had
followed
and
after
the
sawmill
the
tar
kiln
so
that
the
dark
green
forest
was
now
only
a
waste
of
blackened
stumps
and
undergrowth
topped
by
the
vulgar
pine
and
an
occasional
oak
or
juniper
here
and
there
they
passed
an
expanse
of
cultivated
land
and
there
were
many
smaller
clearings
in
which
could
be
seen
plowing
with
gaunt
mules
or
stunted
steers
some
negro
or
listless
po
white
man
or
women
and
children
black
or
white
in
reply
to
a
question
the
coachman
said
that
fetters
had
worked
all
that
country
for
turpentine
years
before
and
had
only
taken
up
cotton
raising
after
the
turpentine
had
been
exhausted
from
the
sand
hills
he
had
left
his
mark
thought
the
colonel
like
the
plague
of
locusts
he
had
settled
and
devoured
and
then
moved
on
leaving
a
barren
waste
behind
him
as
the
morning
advanced
the
settlements
grew
thinner
until
suddenly
upon
reaching
the
crest
of
a
hill
a
great
stretch
of
cultivated
lowland
lay
spread
before
them
in
the
centre
of
the
plantation
near
the
road
which
ran
through
it
stood
a
square
new
freshly
painted
frame
house
which
would
not
have
seemed
out
of
place
in
some
ohio
or
michigan
city
but
here
struck
a
note
alien
to
its
surroundings
off
to
one
side
like
the
negro
quarters
of
another
generation
were
several
rows
of
low
unpainted
cabins
built
of
sawed
lumber
the
boards
running
up
and
down
and
battened
with
strips
where
the
edges
met
the
fields
were
green
with
cotton
and
with
corn
and
there
were
numerous
gangs
of
men
at
work
with
an
apparent
zeal
quite
in
contrast
with
the
leisurely
movement
of
those
they
had
passed
on
the
way
it
was
a
very
pleasing
scene
dis
yer
suh
said
the
coachman
in
an
awed
tone
is
mistah
fetters
plantation
you
ain
gwine
off
nowhere
and
leave
me
alone
whils
you
are
hyuh
is
you
suh
no
said
the
colonel
i
keep
my
eye
on
you
nobody
trouble
you
while
you
with
me
passing
a
clump
of
low
trees
the
colonel
came
upon
a
group
at
sight
of
which
he
paused
involuntarily
a
gang
of
negroes
were
at
work
upon
the
ankles
of
some
was
riveted
an
iron
band
to
which
was
soldered
a
chain
at
the
end
of
which
in
turn
an
iron
ball
was
fastened
accompanying
them
was
a
white
man
in
whose
belt
was
stuck
a
revolver
and
who
carried
in
one
hand
a
stout
leather
strap
about
two
inches
in
width
with
a
handle
by
which
to
grasp
it
the
gang
paused
momentarily
to
look
at
the
traveller
but
at
a
meaning
glance
from
the
overseer
fell
again
to
their
work
of
hoeing
cotton
the
white
man
stepped
to
the
fence
and
colonel
french
addressed
him

road

the
colonel
seemed
to
have
seen
the
overseer
before
but
could
not
remember
where
sam
he
asked
the
coachman
who

that
white

after
this
ejaculation
which
seemed
sincere
as
well
as
fervent
sam
whipped
up
the
horses
and
soon
reached
the
house
a
negro
boy
came
out
to
meet
them
is
fetters
at
home
inquired
the
colonel
i
don
know
suh
i
i
ax
mars
turner
hyuh
he
disappeared
round
the
house
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
turner
with
whom
the
colonel
exchanged
curt
nods
i
wish
to
see
fetters
said
the
colonel
well
you
ca
see
him
why
not
because
he
ai
here
he
left
for
the
capital
this
mornin
to
be

a
week
you

havin
a
fine
drive
down

and
back
the
colonel
ignored
the
taunt
when
will
fetters
return
he
inquired
i
shore
i
do
know
he
do
tell
me
his
secrets
but
i

french
that

and
haines

so
well
that
fetters
has
to
keep
bud
in
order
to
keep
haines
there
no
accountin
for
these
affections
but
they
human
natur
and
they
have
to
be
i
talk
to
your
rejoined
the
colonel
restraining
his
indignation
and
turning
away
turner
looked
after
him
vindictively
he
talk
to
my
like
as
if
i
was
a
nigger
it
be
a
long
time
before
he
talks
to
fetters
if
that
who
he
means
if
i
can
prevent
it
not
that
it
would
make
any
difference
but
i
just
keep
him
on
the
anxious
seat
it
was
nearing
noon
but
the
colonel
had
received
no
invitation
to
stop
or
eat
or
feed
his
horses
he
ordered
sam
to
turn
and
drive
back
the
way
they
had
come
as
they
neared
the
group
of
labourers
they
had
passed
before
the
colonel
saw
four
negroes
in
response
to
an
imperative
gesture
from
the
overseer
seize
one
of
their
number
a
short
thickset
fellow
overpower
some
small
resistance
which
he
seemed
to
make
throw
him
down
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
sit
upon
his
extremities
while
the
overseer
applied
the
broad
leathern
thong
vigorously
to
his
bare
back
the
colonel
reached
over
and
pulled
the
reins
mechanically
his
instinct
was
to
interfere
had
he
been
near
enough
to
recognise
in
the
negro
the
object
of
his
visit
bud
johnson
and
in
the
overseer
the
haines
he
might
have
yielded
to
the
impulse
but
on
second
thought
he
realised
that
he
had
neither
authority
nor
strength
to
make
good
his
interference
for
aught
he
knew
the
performance
might
be
strictly
according
to
law
so
fighting
a
feeling
of
nausea
which
he
could
hardly
conquer
he
ordered
sam
to
drive
on
the
coachman
complied
with
alacrity
as
though
glad
to
escape
from
a
mighty
dangerous
place
he
had
known
friendless
coloured
folks
who
had
strayed
down
in
that
neighbourhood
to
be
lost
for
a
long
time
and
he
had
heard
of
a
spot
far
back
from
the
road
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
plantation
where
the
graves
of
convicts
who
had
died
while
in
fetters
service
were
very
numerous
during
the
next
month
the
colonel
made
several
attempts
to
see
fetters
but
some
fatality
seemed
always
to
prevent
their
meeting
he
finally
left
the
matter
of
finding
fetters
to
caxton
who
ascertained
that
fetters
would
be
in
attendance
at
court
during
a
certain
week
at
carthage
the
county
seat
of
the
adjoining
county
where
the
colonel
had
been
once
before
to
inspect
a
cotton
mill
thither
the
colonel
went
on
the
day
of
the
opening
of
court
his
train
reached
town
toward
noon
and
he
went
over
to
the
hotel
he
wondered
if
he
would
find
the
proprietor
sitting
where
he
had
found
him
some
weeks
before
but
the
buggy
was
gone
from
before
the
piazza
and
there
was
a
new
face
behind
the
desk
the
colonel
registered
left
word
that
he
would
be
in
to
dinner
and
then
went
over
to
the
court
house
which
lay
behind
the
trees
across
the
square
the
court
house
was
an
old
square
brick
structure
whose
walls
whitewashed
the
year
before
had
been
splotched
and
discoloured
by
the
weather
from
one
side
under
the
eaves
projected
a
beam
which
supported
a
bell
rung
by
a
rope
from
the
window
below
a
hall
ran
through
the
centre
on
either
side
of
which
were
the
county
offices
while
the
court
room
with
a
judge
room
and
jury
room
occupied
the
upper
floor
the
colonel
made
his
way
across
the
square
which
showed
the
usual
signs
of
court
being
in
session
there
were
buggies
hitched
to
trees
and
posts
here
and
there
a
few
negroes
sleeping
in
the
sun
and
several
old
coloured
women
with
little
stands
for
the
sale
of
cakes
and
fried
fish
and
cider
the
colonel
went
upstairs
to
the
court
room
it
was
fairly
well
filled
and
he
remained
standing
for
a
few
minutes
near
the
entrance
the
civil
docket
was
evidently
on
trial
for
there
was
a
jury
in
the
box
and
a
witness
was
being
examined
with
some
prolixity
with
reference
to
the
use
of
a
few
inches
of
land
which
lay
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
of
a
disputed
boundary
from
what
the
colonel
could
gather
that
particular
line
fence
dispute
had
been
in
litigation
for
twenty
years
had
cost
several
lives
and
had
resulted
in
a
feud
that
involved
a
whole
township
the
testimony
was
about
concluded
when
the
colonel
entered
and
the
lawyers
began
their
arguments
the
feeling
between
the
litigants
seemed
to
have
affected
their
attorneys
and
the
court
more
than
once
found
it
necessary
to
call
counsel
to
order
the
trial
was
finished
however
without
bloodshed
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
court
was
adjourned
until
two
the
colonel
had
never
met
fetters
nor
had
he
seen
anyone
in
the
court
room
who
seemed
likely
to
be
the
man
but
he
had
seen
his
name
freshly
written
on
the
hotel
register
and
he
would
doubtless
go
there
for
dinner
there
would
be
ample
time
to
get
acquainted
and
transact
his
business
before
court
reassembled
for
the
afternoon
dinner
seemed
to
be
a
rather
solemn
function
and
except
at
a
table
occupied
by
the
judge
and
the
lawyers
in
the
corner
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
colonel
little
was
said
a
glance
about
the
room
showed
no
one
whom
the
colonel
could
imagine
to
be
fetters
and
he
was
about
to
ask
the
waiter
if
that
gentleman
had
yet
entered
the
dining
room
when
a
man
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
the
colonel
looked
up
and
met
the
cheerful
countenance
of
the
liveryman
from
whom
he
had
hired
a
horse
and
buggy
some
weeks
before
howdy
do
said
the
newcomer
amiably
hope
you
been
well
quite
well
returned
the
colonel
how
are
you
oh
just
tendin
no
i
came
down
here
to
see
a
man
that

a
little
different
from
the
time

replied
the
colonel
and
i

the
landlord

no
more
sad
loss
to
carthage
you

one
day

then

a
while
lee

more

but
bark
had
more
science
an
laid
lee

then
bark
went
home
an
tol
the

who

a
mortgage
on
the

he
sol
lee
up
i
hear
he
barberin
or
er
that
sort
up
to
atlanta
an
the
hotel
run
by
another
man
there
fetters
comin
in
now
the
colonel
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
and
was
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
the
redoubtable
fetters
who
walked
over
and
took
his
seat
at
the
table
with
the
judge
and
the
lawyers
he
had
expected
to
meet
a
tall
truculent
individual
in
a
slouch
hat
and
a
frock
coat
with
a
loud
voice
and
a
dictatorial
manner
the
typical
southerner
of
melodrama
he
saw
a
small
man
slightly
gray
wearing
a
business
suit
of
light
tweed
except
for
a
few
little
indications
such
as
the
lack
of
a
crease
in
his
trousers
fetters
looked
like
any
one
of
a
hundred
business
men
whom
the
colonel
might
have
met
on
broadway
in
any
given
fifteen
minutes
during
business
hours
the
colonel
timed
his
meal
so
as
to
leave
the
at
the
same
moment
with
fetters
he
went
up
to
fetters
who
was
chewing
a
toothpick
in
the
office
and
made
himself
known
i
am
french
he
said
he
never
referred
to
himself
by
his
military
title
and
you
i
believe
are
mr
fetters
yes
sir
that
my
name
replied
fetters
without
enthusiasm
but
eyeing
the
colonel
keenly
between
narrowed
lashes
i
been
trying
to
see
you
for
some
time
about
a
matter
continued
the
colonel
but
never
seemed
able
to
catch
up
with
you
before
yes
i
heard
you
were
at
my
house
but
i
was
asleep
upstairs
and
did
know
you
there
till
you
gone
your
man
told
me
you
had
gone
to
the
capital
for
two
weeks
my
man
oh
you
mean
turner
well
i
reckon
you
must
have
riled
turner
somehow
and
he
thought
he
have
a
joke
on
you
i
do
quite
see
the
joke
said
the
colonel
restraining
his
displeasure
but
that
ancient
history
can
we
sit
down
over
here
in
the
shade
and
talk
by
ourselves
for
a
moment
fetters
followed
the
colonel
out
of
doors
where
they
drew
a
couple
of
chairs
to
one
side
and
the
colonel
stated
the
nature
of
his
business
he
wished
to
bargain
for
the
release
of
a
negro
bud
johnson
by
name
held
to
service
by
fetters
under
a
contract
with
clarendon
county
he
was
willing
to
pay
whatever
expense
fetters
had
been
to
on
account
of
johnson
and
an
amount
sufficient
to
cover
any
estimated
profits
from
his
services
meanwhile
fetters
picked
his
teeth
nonchalantly
so
nonchalantly
as
to
irritate
the
colonel
the
colonel
impatience
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
fetters
waited
several
seconds
before
replying
well
fetters
what
say
you
colonel
french
said
fetters
i
reckon
you
ca
have
the
nigger
is
it
a
matter
of
money
asked
the
colonel
name
your
figure
i
do
care
about
the
money
i
want
the
man
for
a
personal
reason
so
do
i
returned
fetters
coolly
and
money
no
object
to
me
i
more
now
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
the
colonel
mastered
his
impatience
he
had
one
appeal
which
no
southerner
could
resist
fetters
he
said
i
wish
to
get
this
man
released
to
please
a
lady
sorry
to
disoblige
a
lady
returned
fetters
but
i
have
to
keep
the
nigger
i
run
a
big
place
and
i
obliged
to
maintain
discipline
this
nigger
has
been
fractious
and
contrary
and
i
sworn
that
he
shall
work
out
his
time
i
have
never
let
any
nigger
get
the
best
of
me
or
white
man
either
he
added
significantly
the
colonel
was
angry
but
controlled
himself
long
enough
to
make
one
more
effort
i
give
you
five
hundred
dollars
for
your
contract
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
you
could
get
him
for
five
thousand
very
well
sir
returned
the
colonel
this
is
not
the
end
of
this
i
will
see
sir
if
a
man
can
be
held
in
slavery
in
this
state
for
a
debt
he
is
willing
and
ready
to
pay
you
hear
more
of
this
before
i
through
with
it
another
thing
colonel
french
said
fetters
his
quiet
eyes
glittering
as
he
spoke
i
wonder
if
you
recollect
an
incident
that
occurred
years
ago
when
we
went
to
the
academy
in
clarendon
if
you
refer
returned
the
colonel
promptly
to
the
time
i
chased
you
down
main
street
yes
i
recalled
it
the
first
time
i
heard
of
you
when
i
came
back
to
clarendon
and
i
remember
why
i
did
it
it
is
a
good
omen
that
as
it
may
be
returned
fetters
quietly
i
did
have
to
recall
it
i
never
forgotten
it
now
you
want
something
from
me
and
you
ca
have
it
we
shall
see
replied
the
colonel
i
bested
you
then
and
i
best
you
now
we
shall
see
said
fetters
fetters
was
not
at
all
alarmed
indeed
he
smiled
rather
pityingly
there
had
been
a
time
when
these
old
aristocrats
could
speak
and
the
earth
trembled
but
that
day
was
over
in
this
age
money
talked
and
he
had
known
how
to
get
money
and
how
to
use
it
to
get
more
there
were
a
dozen
civil
suits
pending
against
him
in
the
court
house
there
and
he
knew
in
advance
that
he
should
win
them
every
one
without
directly
paying
any
juryman
a
dollar
that
any
nigger
should
get
away
while
he
wished
to
hold
him
was
well
inconceivable
colonel
french
might
have
money
but
he
fetters
had
men
as
well
and
if
colonel
french
became
too
troublesome
about
this
nigger
this
friendship
for
niggers
could
be
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
clarendon
too
hot
for
colonel
french
he
really
bore
no
great
malice
against
colonel
french
for
the
little
incident
of
their
school
days
but
he
had
not
forgotten
it
and
colonel
french
might
as
well
learn
a
lesson
he
fetters
had
not
worked
half
a
lifetime
for
a
commanding
position
to
yield
it
to
colonel
french
or
any
other
man
so
fetters
smoked
his
cigar
tranquilly
and
waited
at
the
hotel
for
his
anticipated
verdicts
for
there
could
not
be
a
jury
impanelled
in
the
county
which
did
not
have
on
it
a
majority
of
men
who
were
mortgaged
to
fetters
he
even
held
the
judge
note
for
several
hundred
dollars
the
colonel
waited
at
the
station
for
the
train
back
to
clarendon
when
it
came
it
brought
a
gang
of
convicts
consigned
to
fetters
they
had
been
brought
down
in
the
regular
jim
crow
car
for
the
colonel
saw
coloured
women
and
children
come
out
ahead
of
them
the
colonel
watched
the
wretches
in
coarse
striped
garments
with
chains
on
their
legs
and
shackles
on
their
hands
unloaded
from
the
train
and
into
the
waiting
wagons
there
were
burly
negroes
and
scrawny
negroes
some
wore
the
ashen
hue
of
long
confinement
some
were
shamefaced
some
reckless
some
sullen
a
few
white
convicts
among
them
seemed
doubly
ashamed
both
of
their
condition
and
of
their
company
they
kept
together
as
much
as
they
were
permitted
and
looked
with
contempt
at
their
black
companions
in
misfortune
fetters
man
and
haines
armed
with
whips
and
with
pistols
in
their
belts
were
present
to
oversee
the
unloading
and
the
colonel
could
see
them
point
him
out
to
the
state
officers
who
had
come
in
charge
of
the
convicts
and
see
them
look
at
him
with
curious
looks
the
scene
was
not
edifying
there
were
criminals
in
new
york
he
knew
very
well
but
he
had
never
seen
one
they
were
not
marched
down
broadway
in
stripes
and
chains
there
were
certain
functions
of
society
as
of
the
body
which
were
more
decently
performed
in
retirement
there
was
work
in
the
state
for
the
social
reformer
and
the
colonel
undismayed
by
his
temporary
defeat
metaphorically
girded
up
his
loins
went
home
and
still
metaphorically
set
out
to
put
a
spoke
in
fetters
wheel
his
first
step
was
to
have
caxton
look
up
and
abstract
for
him
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state
they
were
bad
enough
in
all
conscience
men
could
be
tried
without
jury
and
condemned
to
infamous
punishments
involving
stripes
and
chains
for
misdemeanours
which
in
more
enlightened
states
were
punished
with
a
small
fine
or
brief
detention
there
were
for
instance
no
degrees
of
larceny
and
the
heaviest
punishment
might
be
inflicted
at
the
discretion
of
the
judge
for
the
least
offense
the
vagrancy
law
of
which
the
colonel
had
had
some
experience
was
an
open
bid
for
injustice
and
graft
and
clearly
designed
to
profit
the
strong
at
the
expense
of
the
weak
the
laws
were
little
more
than
the
instruments
of
organised
robbery
to
these
laws
the
colonel
called
the
attention
of
some
of
his
neighbours
with
whom
he
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
the
enlightened
few
had
scarcely
known
of
their
existence
and
quite
agreed
that
the
laws
were
harsh
and
ought
to
be
changed
but
when
the
colonel
pursuing
his
inquiry
undertook
to
investigate
the
operation
of
these
laws
he
found
an
appalling
condition
the
statutes
were
mild
and
beneficent
compared
with
the
results
obtained
under
cover
of
them
caxton
spent
several
weeks
about
the
state
looking
up
the
criminal
records
and
following
up
the
sentences
inflicted
working
not
merely
for
his
fee
but
sharing
the
indignation
at
the
state
of
things
unearthed
convict
labour
was
contracted
out
to
private
parties
with
little
or
no
effective
state
supervision
on
terms
which
though
exceedingly
profitable
to
the
state
were
disastrous
to
free
competitive
labour
more
than
one
lawmaker
besides
fetters
was
numbered
among
these
contractors
leaving
the
realm
of
crime
they
found
that
on
hundreds
of
farms
ignorant
negroes
and
sometimes
poor
whites
were
held
in
bondage
under
claims
of
debt
or
under
contracts
of
exclusive
employment
for
long
terms
of
years
contracts
extorted
from
ignorance
by
craft
aided
by
state
laws
which
made
it
a
misdemeanour
to
employ
such
persons
elsewhere
free
men
were
worked
side
by
side
with
convicts
from
the
penitentiary
and
women
and
children
herded
with
the
most
depraved
criminals
thus
breeding
a
criminal
class
to
prey
upon
the
state
in
the
case
of
fetters
alone
the
colonel
found
a
dozen
instances
where
the
law
bad
as
it
was
had
not
been
sufficient
for
fetters
purpose
but
had
been
plainly
violated
caxton
discovered
a
discharged
guard
of
fetters
who
told
him
of
many
things
that
had
taken
place
at
sycamore
and
brought
another
guard
one
evening
at
that
time
employed
there
who
told
him
among
other
things
that
bud
johnson
life
owing
to
his
surliness
and
rebellious
conduct
and
some
spite
which
haines
seemed
to
bear
against
him
was
simply
a
hell
on
earth
that
even
a
strong
negro
could
not
stand
it
indefinitely
a
case
was
made
up
and
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
witnesses
were
summoned
at
the
colonel
instance
at
the
last
moment
they
all
weakened
even
the
discharged
guard
and
their
testimony
was
not
sufficient
to
justify
an
indictment
the
colonel
then
sued
out
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
the
body
of
bud
johnson
and
it
was
heard
before
the
common
pleas
court
at
clarendon
with
public
opinion
divided
between
the
colonel
and
fetters
the
court
held
that
under
his
contract
for
which
he
had
paid
the
consideration
fetters
was
entitled
to
johnson
services
the
colonel
defeated
but
still
undismayed
ordered
caxton
to
prepare
a
memorial
for
presentation
to
the
federal
authorities
calling
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
peonage
a
crime
under
the
federal
statutes
was
being
flagrantly
practised
in
the
state
this
allegation
was
supported
by
a
voluminous
brief
giving
names
and
dates
and
particular
instances
of
barbarity
the
colonel
was
not
without
some
quiet
support
in
this
movement
there
were
several
men
in
the
county
including
his
able
lieutenant
caxton
price
and
old
general
thornton
none
of
whom
were
under
any
obligation
to
fetters
and
who
all
acknowledged
that
something
ought
to
be
done
to
purge
the
state
of
a
great
disgrace
there
was
another
party
of
course
which
deprecated
any
scandal
which
would
involve
the
good
name
of
the
state
or
reflect
upon
the
south
and
who
insisted
that
in
time
these
things
would
pass
away
and
there
would
be
no
trace
of
them
in
future
generations
but
the
colonel
insisted
that
so
also
would
the
victims
of
the
system
pass
away
who
being
already
in
existence
were
certainly
entitled
to
as
much
consideration
as
generations
yet
unborn
it
was
hardly
fair
to
sacrifice
them
to
a
mere
punctilio
the
colonel
had
reached
the
conviction
that
the
regenerative
forces
of
education
and
enlightenment
in
order
to
have
any
effect
in
his
generation
must
be
reinforced
by
some
positive
legislative
or
executive
action
or
else
the
untrammelled
forces
of
graft
and
greed
would
override
them
and
he
was
human
enough
at
this
stage
of
his
career
to
wish
to
see
the
result
of
his
labours
or
at
least
a
promise
of
result
the
colonel
papers
were
forwarded
to
the
proper
place
whence
they
were
referred
from
official
to
official
and
from
department
to
department
that
it
might
take
some
time
to
set
in
motion
the
machinery
necessary
to
reach
the
evil
the
colonel
knew
very
well
and
hence
was
not
impatient
at
any
reasonable
delay
had
he
known
that
his
presentation
had
created
a
sensation
in
the
highest
quarter
but
that
owing
to
the
exigencies
of
national
politics
it
was
not
deemed
wise
at
that
time
to
do
anything
which
seemed
like
an
invasion
of
state
rights
or
savoured
of
sectionalism
he
might
not
have
been
so
serenely
confident
of
the
outcome
nor
had
fetters
known
as
much
would
he
have
done
the
one
thing
which
encouraged
the
colonel
more
than
anything
else
caxton
received
a
message
one
day
from
judge
bullard
representing
fetters
in
which
fetters
made
the
offer
that
if
colonel
french
would
stop
his
agitation
on
the
labour
laws
and
withdraw
any
papers
he
had
filed
and
promise
to
drop
the
whole
matter
he
would
release
bud
johnson
the
colonel
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
he
had
gone
into
this
fight
for
johnson
or
rather
to
please
miss
laura
he
had
risen
now
to
higher
game
nothing
less
than
the
system
would
satisfy
him
but
colonel
said
caxton
it
pretty
hard
on
the
nigger
kill
him
before
his
time
up
if
you
give
me
a
free
hand
i
get
him
anyway
how
perhaps
it
just
as
well
you
should
know
but
i
have
friends
at
sycamore
you
would
break
the
law
asked
the
colonel
fetters
is
breaking
the
law
replied
caxton
he
holding
johnson
for
debt
and
whether
that
is
lawful
or
not
he
certainly
has
no
right
to
kill
him
you
right
replied
the
colonel
get
johnson
away
i
do
care
how
the
end
justifies
the
means
that
an
argument
that
goes
down
here
get
him
away
and
send
him
a
long
way
off
and
he
can
write
for
his
wife
to
join
him
his
escape
need
not
interfere
with
our
other
plans
we
have
plenty
of
other
cases
against
fetters
within
a
week
johnson
with
the
connivance
of
a
bribed
guard
a
man
from
clarendon
had
escaped
from
fetters
and
seemingly
vanished
from
beaver
county
fetters
lieutenants
were
active
in
their
search
for
him
but
sought
in
vain
ben
dudley
awoke
the
morning
after
the
assembly
ball
with
a
violent
headache
and
a
sense
of
extreme
depression
which
was
not
relieved
by
the
sight
of
his
reflection
in
the
of
the
bureau
in
the
hotel
bedroom
where
he
found
himself
one
of
his
eyes
was
bloodshot
and
surrounded
by
a
wide
area
of
discolouration
and
he
was
conscious
of
several
painful
contusions
on
other
portions
of
his
body
his
clothing
was
badly
disordered
and
stained
with
blood
and
all
in
all
he
was
scarcely
in
a
condition
to
appear
in
public
he
made
such
a
toilet
as
he
could
and
anxious
to
avoid
observation
had
his
horse
brought
from
the
livery
around
to
the
rear
door
of
the
hotel
and
left
for
mink
run
by
the
back
streets
he
did
not
return
to
town
for
a
week
and
when
he
made
his
next
appearance
there
upon
strictly
a
business
visit
did
not
go
near
the
treadwells
and
wore
such
a
repellent
look
that
no
one
ventured
to
speak
to
him
about
his
encounter
with
fetters
and
mcrae
he
was
humiliated
and
ashamed
and
angry
with
himself
and
all
the
world
he
had
lost
graciella
already
any
possibility
that
might
have
remained
of
regaining
her
affection
was
destroyed
by
his
having
made
her
name
the
excuse
for
a
barroom
broil
his
uncle
was
not
well
and
with
the
decline
of
his
health
his
monomania
grew
more
acute
and
more
absorbing
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
search
for
the
treasure
and
in
expostulations
with
viney
to
reveal
its
whereabouts
the
supervision
of
the
plantation
work
occupied
ben
most
of
the
time
and
during
his
intervals
of
leisure
he
sought
to
escape
unpleasant
thoughts
by
busying
himself
with
the
model
of
his
cotton
gin
his
life
had
run
along
in
this
way
for
about
two
weeks
after
the
ball
when
one
night
barclay
fetters
while
coming
to
town
from
his
father
plantation
at
sycamore
in
company
with
turner
his
foreman
was
fired
upon
from
ambush
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mink
run
and
seriously
wounded
groaning
heavily
and
in
a
state
of
he
was
driven
by
turner
in
the
same
buggy
in
which
he
had
been
shot
to
doctor
price
house
which
lay
between
mink
run
and
the
town
the
doctor
examined
the
wound
which
was
serious
a
charge
of
buckshot
had
been
fired
at
close
range
from
a
clump
of
bushes
by
the
wayside
and
the
charge
had
taken
effect
in
the
side
of
the
face
the
sight
of
one
eye
was
destroyed
beyond
a
peradventure
and
that
of
the
other
endangered
by
a
possible
injury
to
the
optic
nerve
a
sedative
was
administered
as
many
as
possible
of
the
shot
extracted
and
the
wounds
dressed
meantime
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
sycamore
for
fetters
senior
who
came
before
morning
to
his
anxious
inquiries
the
doctor
could
give
no
very
hopeful
answer
he
not
out
of
danger
said
doctor
price
and
wo
be
for
several
days
i
have
found
several
of
those
shot
and
until
they
located
i
ca
tell
what
will
happen
your
son
has
a
good
constitution
but
it
has
been
abused
somewhat
and
is
not
in
the
best
condition
to
throw
off
an
injury
do
the
best
you
can
for
him
doc
said
fetters
and
i
make
it
worth
your
while
and
as
for
the
scoundrel
that
shot
him
in
the
dark
i
rake
this
county
with
a
comb
till
found
if
bark
dies
the
murderer
shall
hang
as
high
as
haman
if
it
costs
me
a
million
dollars
or
if
bark
gets
well
he
shall
have
the
limit
of
the
law
no
man
in
this
state
shall
injure
me
or
mine
and
go
unpunished
the
next
day
ben
dudley
was
arrested
at
mink
run
on
a
warrant
sworn
out
by
fetters
senior
charging
dudley
with
attempted
murder
the
accused
was
brought
to
clarendon
and
lodged
in
beaver
county
jail
ben
sent
for
caxton
from
whom
he
learned
that
his
offense
was
not
subject
to
bail
until
it
became
certain
that
barclay
fetters
would
recover
for
in
the
event
of
his
death
the
charge
would
be
murder
in
case
of
recovery
the
offense
would
be
merely
attempted
murder
or
shooting
with
intent
to
kill
for
which
bail
was
allowable
meantime
he
would
have
to
remain
in
jail
in
a
day
or
two
young
fetters
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
so
far
as
his
life
was
concerned
and
colonel
french
through
caxton
offered
to
sign
ben
bail
bond
to
caxton
surprise
dudley
refused
to
accept
bail
at
the
colonel
hands
i
do
want
any
favours
from
colonel
french
he
said
decidedly
i
prefer
to
stay
in
jail
rather
than
to
be
released
on
his
bond
so
he
remained
in
jail
graciella
was
not
so
much
surprised
at
ben
refusal
to
accept
bail
she
had
reasoned
out
with
a
fine
instinct
the
train
of
emotions
which
had
brought
her
lover
to
grief
and
her
own
share
in
stirring
them
up
she
could
not
believe
that
ben
was
capable
of
shooting
a
man
from
ambush
but
even
if
he
had
it
would
have
been
for
love
of
her
and
if
he
had
not
she
had
nevertheless
been
the
moving
cause
of
the
disaster
she
would
not
willingly
have
done
young
fetters
an
injury
he
had
favoured
her
by
his
attentions
and
if
all
stories
were
true
he
had
behaved
better
than
ben
in
the
difficulty
between
them
and
had
suffered
more
but
she
loved
ben
as
she
grew
to
realise
more
and
more
she
wanted
to
go
and
see
ben
in
jail
but
her
aunt
did
not
think
it
proper
appearances
were
all
against
ben
and
he
had
not
purged
himself
by
any
explanation
so
graciella
sat
down
and
wrote
him
a
long
letter
she
knew
very
well
that
the
one
thing
that
would
do
him
most
good
would
be
the
announcement
of
her
aunt
engagement
to
colonel
french
there
was
no
way
to
bring
this
about
except
by
first
securing
her
aunt
permission
this
would
make
necessary
a
frank
confession
to
which
after
an
effort
she
nerved
herself
aunt
laura
she
said
at
a
moment
when
they
were
alone
together
i
know
why
ben
will
not
accept
bail
from
colonel
french
and
why
he
will
not
tell
his
side
of
the
quarrel
between
himself
and
fetters
he
was
foolish
enough
to
imagine
that
colonel
french
was
coming
to
the
house
to
see
me
and
that
i
preferred
the
colonel
to
him
and
aunt
laura
i
have
a
confession
to
make
i
have
done
something
for
which
i
want
to
beg
your
pardon
i
listened
that
night
and
overheard
the
colonel
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
please
dear
aunt
laura
forgive
me
and
let
me
write
and
tell
ben
just
ben
in
confidence
no
one
else
need
know
it
miss
laura
was
shocked
and
pained
and
frankly
said
so
but
could
not
refuse
the
permission
on
condition
that
ben
should
be
pledged
to
keep
her
secret
which
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
was
not
yet
ready
to
make
public
she
too
was
fond
of
ben
and
hoped
that
he
might
clear
himself
of
the
accusation
so
graciella
wrote
the
letter
she
was
no
more
frank
in
it
however
on
one
point
than
she
had
been
with
her
aunt
for
she
carefully
avoided
saying
that
she
taken
colonel
french
attentions
seriously
or
built
any
hopes
upon
them
but
chided
ben
for
putting
such
a
construction
upon
her
innocent
actions
and
informed
him
as
proof
of
his
folly
and
in
the
strictest
confidence
that
colonel
french
was
engaged
to
her
aunt
laura
she
expressed
her
sorrow
for
his
predicament
her
profound
belief
in
his
innocence
and
her
unhesitating
conviction
that
he
would
be
acquitted
of
the
pending
charge
to
this
she
expected
by
way
of
answer
a
long
letter
of
apology
explanation
and
protestations
of
undying
love
she
received
instead
a
brief
note
containing
a
cold
acknowledgment
of
her
letter
thanking
her
for
her
interest
in
his
welfare
and
assuring
her
that
he
would
respect
miss
laura
confidence
there
was
no
note
of
love
or
reproachfulness
mere
cold
courtesy
graciella
was
cut
to
the
quick
so
much
so
that
she
did
not
even
notice
ben
mistakes
in
spelling
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
overwhelmed
her
with
reproaches
it
would
have
shown
at
least
that
he
still
loved
her
she
cried
bitterly
and
lay
awake
very
late
that
night
wondering
what
else
she
could
do
for
ben
that
a
young
lady
might
for
the
first
time
she
was
more
concerned
about
ben
than
about
herself
if
by
marrying
him
immediately
she
could
have
saved
him
from
danger
and
disgrace
she
would
have
done
so
without
one
selfish
thought
unless
it
were
selfish
to
save
one
whom
she
loved
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
case
of
the
state
benjamin
dudley
was
held
as
soon
as
doctor
price
pronounced
barclay
fetters
out
of
danger
the
proceedings
took
place
before
squire
reddick
the
same
justice
from
whom
the
colonel
had
bought
peter
services
and
from
whom
he
had
vainly
sought
to
secure
bud
johnson
release
in
spite
of
dudley
curt
refusal
of
his
assistance
the
colonel
to
whom
miss
laura
had
conveyed
a
hint
of
the
young
man
frame
of
mind
had
instructed
caxton
to
spare
no
trouble
or
expense
in
the
interest
there
was
little
doubt
considering
fetters
influence
and
vindictiveness
that
dudley
would
be
remanded
though
the
evidence
against
him
was
purely
circumstantial
but
it
was
important
that
the
evidence
should
be
carefully
scrutinised
and
every
legal
safeguard
put
to
use
the
case
looked
bad
for
the
prisoner
barclay
fetters
was
not
present
nor
did
the
prosecution
need
him
his
testimony
could
only
have
been
cumulative
turner
described
the
circumstances
of
the
shooting
from
the
trees
by
the
roadside
near
mink
run
and
the
driving
of
the
wounded
man
to
doctor
price
doctor
price
swore
to
the
nature
of
the
wound
its
present
and
probable
consequences
which
involved
the
loss
of
one
eye
and
perhaps
the
other
and
produced
the
shot
he
had
extracted
mcrae
testified
that
he
and
barclay
fetters
had
gone
down
between
dances
from
the
opera
ball
to
the
hotel
bar
to
get
a
glass
of
seltzer
they
had
no
sooner
entered
the
bar
than
the
prisoner
who
had
evidently
been
drinking
heavily
and
showed
all
the
signs
of
intoxication
had
picked
a
quarrel
with
them
and
assaulted
fetters
fetters
with
the
aid
of
the
witness
had
defended
himself
in
the
course
of
the
altercation
the
prisoner
had
used
violent
and
profane
language
threatening
among
other
things
to
kill
fetters
all
this
testimony
was
objected
to
but
was
admitted
as
tending
to
show
a
motive
for
the
crime
this
closed
the
state
case
caxton
held
a
hurried
consultation
with
his
client
should
they
put
in
any
evidence
which
would
be
merely
to
show
their
hand
since
the
prisoner
would
in
any
event
undoubtedly
be
bound
over
ben
was
unable
to
deny
what
had
taken
place
at
the
hotel
for
he
had
no
distinct
recollection
of
it
merely
a
blurred
impression
like
the
memory
of
a
bad
dream
he
could
not
swear
that
he
had
not
threatened
fetters
the
state
witnesses
had
refrained
from
mentioning
the
lady
name
he
could
do
no
less
so
far
as
the
shooting
was
concerned
he
had
had
no
weapon
with
which
to
shoot
his
gun
had
been
stolen
that
very
day
and
had
not
been
recovered
the
defense
will
offer
no
testimony
declared
caxton
at
the
result
of
the
conference
the
justice
held
the
prisoner
to
the
grand
jury
and
fixed
the
bond
at
ten
thousand
dollars
graciella
information
had
not
been
without
its
effect
and
when
caxton
suggested
that
he
could
still
secure
bail
he
had
little
difficulty
in
inducing
ben
to
accept
colonel
friendly
offices
the
bail
bond
was
made
out
and
signed
and
the
prisoner
released
caxton
took
ben
to
his
office
after
the
hearing
there
ben
met
the
colonel
thanked
him
for
his
aid
and
friendship
and
apologised
for
his
former
rudeness
i
was
in
a
bad
way
sir
he
said
and
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
but
i
know
i
did
shoot
bark
fetters
and
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
sure
you
did
my
boy
said
the
colonel
laying
his
hand
in
familiar
fashion
upon
the
young
fellow
shoulder
and
we
prove
it
before
we
quit
there
are
some
ladies
who
believe
the
same
thing
and
would
like
to
hear
you
say
it
thank
you
sir
said
ben
i
should
like
to
tell
them
but
i
should
want
to
enter
their
house
until
i
am
cleared
of
this
charge
i
think
too
much
of
them
to
expose
them
to
any
remarks
about
harbouring
a
man
out
on
bail
for
a
penitentiary
offense
i
write
to
them
sir
and
thank
them
for
their
trust
and
friendship
and
you
can
tell
them
for
me
if
you
will
that
i
come
to
see
them
when
not
only
i
but
everybody
else
can
say
that
i
am
fit
to
go
your
feelings
do
you
credit
returned
the
colonel
warmly
and
however
much
they
would
like
to
see
you
i
sure
the
ladies
will
appreciate
your
delicacy
as
your
friend
and
theirs
you
must
permit
me
to
serve
you
further
whenever
the
opportunity
offers
until
this
affair
is
finished
ben
thanked
the
colonel
from
a
full
heart
and
went
back
to
mink
run
where
in
the
effort
to
catch
up
the
plantation
work
which
had
fallen
behind
in
his
absence
he
sought
to
forget
the
prison
atmosphere
and
lose
the
prison
pallor
the
disgrace
of
having
been
in
jail
was
indelible
and
the
danger
was
by
no
means
over
the
sympathy
of
his
friends
would
have
been
priceless
to
him
but
to
remain
away
from
them
would
be
not
only
the
honourable
course
to
pursue
but
a
just
punishment
for
his
own
folly
for
graciella
after
all
was
only
a
girl
a
young
girl
and
scarcely
yet
to
be
judged
harshly
for
her
actions
while
he
was
a
man
grown
who
knew
better
and
had
not
acted
according
to
his
lights
three
days
after
ben
dudley
release
on
bail
clarendon
was
treated
to
another
sensation
former
constable
haines
now
employed
as
an
overseer
at
fetters
convict
farm
while
driving
in
a
buggy
to
clarendon
where
he
spent
his
spells
was
shot
from
ambush
near
mink
run
and
his
right
arm
shattered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
require
amputation
colonel
french
interest
in
ben
dudley
affairs
had
not
been
permitted
to
interfere
with
his
various
enterprises
work
on
the
chief
of
these
the
cotton
mill
had
gone
steadily
forward
with
only
occasional
delays
incident
to
the
delivery
of
material
the
weather
and
the
health
of
the
workmen
which
was
often
uncertain
for
a
day
or
two
after
pay
day
the
coloured
foreman
of
the
had
been
seriously
ill
his
place
had
been
filled
by
a
white
man
under
whom
the
walls
were
rising
rapidly
jim
green
the
foreman
whom
the
colonel
had
formerly
discharged
and
the
two
white
who
had
quit
at
the
same
time
applied
for
reinstatement
the
colonel
took
the
two
men
on
again
but
declined
to
restore
green
who
had
been
discharged
for
insubordination
green
went
away
swearing
vengeance
at
clay
johnson
saloon
he
hurled
invectives
at
the
colonel
to
all
who
would
listen
and
with
anger
and
bad
whiskey
soon
worked
himself
into
a
frame
of
mind
that
was
ripe
for
any
mischief
some
of
his
utterances
were
reported
to
the
colonel
who
was
not
without
friends
the
wealthy
seldom
are
but
he
paid
no
particular
attention
to
them
except
to
keep
a
watchman
at
the
mill
at
night
lest
this
hostility
should
seek
an
outlet
in
some
attempt
to
injure
the
property
the
precaution
was
not
amiss
for
once
the
watchman
shot
at
a
figure
prowling
about
the
mill
the
lesson
was
sufficient
apparently
for
there
was
no
immediate
necessity
to
repeat
it
the
shooting
of
haines
while
not
so
sensational
as
that
of
barclay
fetters
had
given
rise
to
considerable
feeling
against
ben
dudley
that
two
young
men
should
quarrel
and
exchange
shots
would
not
ordinarily
have
been
a
subject
of
extended
remark
but
two
attempts
at
assassination
constituted
a
much
graver
affair
that
dudley
was
responsible
for
this
second
assault
was
the
generally
accepted
opinion
fetters
friends
and
hirelings
were
openly
hostile
to
young
dudley
and
haines
had
been
heard
to
say
in
his
cups
at
clay
jackson
saloon
that
when
young
dudley
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
he
would
be
hired
out
to
fetters
who
had
the
country
contract
and
that
he
haines
would
be
delighted
to
have
dudley
in
his
gang
the
feeling
against
dudley
grew
from
day
to
day
and
threats
and
bets
were
openly
made
that
he
would
not
live
to
be
tried
there
was
no
direct
proof
against
him
but
the
moral
and
circumstantial
evidence
was
quite
sufficient
to
convict
him
in
the
eyes
of
fetter
friends
and
supporters
the
colonel
was
sometimes
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
affair
as
a
friend
of
ben
for
whom
he
had
given
bail
and
as
an
enemy
of
fetters
to
whom
his
antagonism
in
various
ways
had
become
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
and
interest
one
day
while
the
excitement
attending
the
second
shooting
was
thus
growing
colonel
french
received
through
the
mail
a
mysteriously
worded
note
vaguely
hinting
at
some
matter
of
public
importance
which
the
writer
wished
to
communicate
to
him
and
requesting
a
private
interview
for
the
purpose
that
evening
at
the
colonel
house
the
note
which
had
every
internal
evidence
of
sincerity
was
signed
by
henry
taylor
the
principal
of
the
coloured
school
whom
the
colonel
had
met
several
times
in
reference
to
the
proposed
industrial
school
from
the
tenor
of
the
communication
and
what
he
knew
about
taylor
the
colonel
had
no
doubt
that
the
matter
was
one
of
importance
at
least
not
one
to
be
dismissed
without
examination
he
thereupon
stepped
into
caxton
office
and
wrote
an
answer
to
the
letter
fixing
eight
that
evening
as
the
time
and
his
own
library
as
the
place
of
a
meeting
with
the
teacher
this
letter
he
deposited
in
the
personally
it
was
only
a
step
from
caxton
office
upon
coming
out
of
the
he
saw
the
teacher
standing
on
an
opposite
corner
when
the
colonel
had
passed
out
of
sight
taylor
crossed
the
street
entered
the
and
soon
emerged
with
the
letter
he
had
given
no
sign
that
he
saw
the
colonel
but
had
looked
rather
ostentatiously
the
other
way
when
that
gentleman
had
glanced
in
his
direction
at
the
appointed
hour
there
was
a
light
step
on
the
colonel
piazza
the
colonel
was
on
watch
and
opened
the
door
himself
ushering
taylor
into
his
library
a
very
handsome
and
comfortable
room
the
door
of
which
he
carefully
closed
behind
them
the
teacher
looked
around
cautiously
are
we
alone
sir
yes
entirely
so
and
can
any
one
hear
us
no
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
colonel
french
replied
the
other
i
in
a
hard
situation
and
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
never
let
on
to
any
body
that
i
told
you
what
i
going
to
say
all
right
taylor
if
it
is
a
proper
promise
to
make
you
can
trust
my
discretion
yes
sir
i
sure
i
can
we
coloured
folks
sir
are
often
accused
of
trying
to
shield
criminals
of
our
own
race
or
of
not
helping
the
officers
of
the
law
to
catch
them
maybe
we
does
suh
he
said
lapsing
in
his
earnestness
into
bad
grammar
maybe
we
does
sometimes
but
not
without
reason
what
reason
asked
the
colonel
well
sir
fer
the
reason
that
we
ai
always
shore
that
a
coloured
man
will
get
a
fair
trial
or
any
trial
at
all
or
that
he
get
a
just
sentence
after
he
been
tried
we
have
no
hand
in
makin
the
laws
or
in
enforcin
we
are
not
summoned
on
jury
and
yet
asked
to
do
the
work
of
constables
and
sheriffs
who
are
paid
for
arrestin
criminals
an
for
protectin
from
mobs
which
they
do
do
i
have
no
doubt
every
word
you
say
is
true
taylor
and
such
a
state
of
things
is
unjust
and
will
some
day
be
different
if
i
can
help
to
make
it
so
but
nevertheless
all
good
citizens
whatever
their
colour
ought
to
help
to
preserve
peace
and
good
order
yes
sir
so
they
ought
and
i
want
to
do
just
that
i
want
to
and
a
whole
heap
of
us
want
to
with
the
good
white
people
to
keep
down
crime
and
lawlessness
i
know
there
good
white
people
who
want
to
see
justice
done
but
they
ai
always
strong
enough
to
run
things
an
if
any
one
of
us
coloured
folks
tells
on
another
one
he
liable
to
lose
all
his
frien
but
i
believe
sir
that
i
can
trust
you
to
save
me
harmless
and
to
see
that
mo
than
justice
is
done
to
the
coloured
man
yes
taylor
you
can
trust
me
to
do
all
that
i
can
and
i
think
i
have
considerable
influence
now
what
on
your
mind
do
you
know
who
shot
haines
and
mr
fetters
well
sir
you
a
mighty
good
guesser
it
ai
so
much

that
place

the
country
is
a
hell
on
earth
an
they
the
devils
that
runs
it
but
there
a
friend
of
in
trouble
for
something
he
didn
do

innocent
man

the
penitentiary
though

a
po
negro
has
been
yes
sir
i
know
that
ben
dudley
didn
shoot
them
two
white
men
so

rejoined
the
colonel
who
did
it
was
bud
johnson
the
man

tried
to
get
away
from
fetters
coachman
tol
us
about
it
sir
an
we
know
how
good
a
friend
of
ours
you
are
from
what
you
promised
us
about
the
school
an
i
wanted
you
to
know
sir
you
are
our
friend
and
have
showed
confidence
in
us
and
i
wanted
to
prove
to
you
that
we
are
not
ungrateful
an
that
we
want
to
be
good
citizens
i
had
heard
said
the
colonel
that
johnson
had
escaped
and
left
the
county
so
he
had
sir
but
he
came
back
they
had
him
down
at
that
place
till
he
swore
he
kill
every
one
that
had
anything
to
do
with
him
it
was
turner
he
shot
at
the
first
time
and
he
hit
young
fetters
by
accident
he
stole
a
gun
from
ole
dudley
place
at
mink
run
shot
fetters
with
it
and
has
kept
it
ever
since
and
shot
haines
with
it
i
suppose
they
ketched
him
before
if
it
had
for
suspectin
young
mr
dudley
where
is
johnson
now
asked
the
colonel
he
hidin
in
an
old
log
cabin
down
by
the
swamp
back
of
mink
run
he
sleeps
in
the
daytime
and
goes
out
at
night
to
get
food
and
watch
for
white
men
from
fetters
place
does
his
wife
know
where
he
is
no
sir
he
ai
never
let
her
know
by
the
way
taylor
asked
the
colonel
how
do
know
all
this
well
sir
replied
the
teacher
with
something
which
in
an
uneducated
negro
would
have
been
a
very
pronounced
chuckle
mighty
little
goin
on
roun
here
that
i
find
out
sooner
or
later
taylor
said
the
colonel
rising
to
terminate
the
interview
you
have
rendered
a
public
service
have
proved
yourself
a
good
citizen
and
have
relieved
dudley
of
serious
embarrassment
i
will
see
that
steps
are
taken
to
apprehend
johnson
and
will
keep
your
participation
in
the
matter
secret
since
you
think
it
would
hurt
your
influence
with
your
people
and
i
promise
you
faithfully
that
every
effort
shall
be
made
to
see
that
johnson
has
a
fair
trial
and
no
more
than
a
just
punishment
he
gave
the
negro
his
hand
thank
you
sir
thank
you
sir
replied
the
teacher
returning
the
colonel
clasp
if
there
were
more
white
men
like
you
the
coloured
folks
would
have
no
more
trouble
the
colonel
let
taylor
out
and
watched
him
as
he
looked
cautiously
up
and
down
the
street
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
that
coloured
folks
or
any
other
kind
should
ever
cease
to
have
trouble
was
a
vain
imagining
but
the
teacher
had
made
a
complaint
of
injustice
which
ought
to
be
capable
of
correction
and
he
had
performed
a
action
even
though
he
had
felt
constrained
to
do
it
in
a
clandestine
manner
about
his
own
part
in
the
affair
the
colonel
was
troubled
it
was
becoming
clear
to
him
that
the
task
he
had
undertaken
was
no
light
one
not
the
task
of
apprehending
johnson
and
clearing
dudley
but
that
of
leavening
the
inert
mass
of
clarendon
with
the
leaven
of
enlightenment
with
the
best
of
intentions
and
hoping
to
save
a
life
he
had
connived
at
turning
a
murderer
loose
upon
the
community
it
was
true
that
the
community
through
unjust
laws
had
made
him
a
murderer
but
it
was
no
part
of
the
colonel
plan
to
foster
or
promote
evil
passions
or
to
help
the
victims
of
the
law
to
make
reprisals
his
aim
was
to
bring
about
by
better
laws
and
more
liberal
ideas
peace
harmony
and
universal
good
will
there
was
a
colossal
work
for
him
to
do
and
for
all
whom
he
could
enlist
with
him
in
this
cause
the
very
standards
of
right
and
wrong
had
been
confused
by
the
race
issue
and
must
be
set
right
by
the
patient
appeal
to
reason
and
humanity
primitive
passions
and
private
vengeance
must
be
subordinated
to
law
and
order
and
the
higher
good
a
new
body
of
thought
must
be
built
up
in
which
stress
must
be
laid
upon
the
eternal
verities
in
the
light
of
which
difficulties
which
now
seemed
unsurmountable
would
be
gradually
overcome
but
this
halcyon
period
was
yet
afar
off
and
the
colonel
roused
himself
to
the
duty
of
the
hour
with
the
best
intentions
he
had
let
loose
upon
the
community
in
a
questionable
way
a
desperate
character
it
was
no
less
than
his
plain
duty
to
put
the
man
under
restraint
to
rescue
from
fetters
a
man
whose
life
was
threatened
was
one
thing
to
leave
a
murderer
at
large
now
would
be
to
endanger
innocent
lives
and
imperil
ben
dudley
future
the
arrest
of
bud
johnson
brought
an
end
to
the
case
against
ben
dudley
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
was
under
political
obligations
to
fetters
seemed
reluctant
to
dismiss
the
case
until
guilt
should
have
been
legally
proved
but
the
result
of
the
preliminary
hearing
rendered
this
position
no
longer
tenable
the
case
against
ben
was
nolled
and
he
could
now
hold
up
his
head
as
a
free
man
with
no
stain
upon
his
character
indeed
the
reaction
in
his
favour
as
one
unjustly
indicted
went
far
to
wipe
out
from
the
public
mind
the
impression
that
he
was
a
drunkard
and
a
rowdy
it
was
recalled
that
he
was
of
good
family
and
that
his
forebears
had
rendered
valuable
service
to
the
state
and
that
he
had
never
been
seen
to
drink
before
or
known
to
be
in
a
fight
but
that
on
the
contrary
he
was
quiet
and
harmless
to
a
fault
indeed
the
clarendon
public
would
have
admired
a
little
more
spirit
in
a
young
man
even
to
the
extent
of
condoning
an
occasional
lapse
into
license
there
was
sincere
rejoicing
at
the
treadwell
house
when
ben
now
free
in
mind
went
around
to
see
the
ladies
miss
laura
was
warmly
sympathetic
and
congratulatory
and
graciella
tearfully
happy
tried
to
make
up
by
a
sweet
humility
through
which
shone
the
true
womanliness
of
a
hitherto
undeveloped
character
for
the
past
stings
and
humiliations
to
which
her
selfish
caprice
had
subjected
her
lover
ben
resumed
his
visits
if
not
with
quite
their
former
frequency
and
it
was
only
a
day
or
two
later
that
the
colonel
found
him
and
graciella
with
his
own
boy
phil
grouped
in
familiar
fashion
on
the
steps
where
ben
was
demonstrating
with
some
pride
of
success
the
operation
of
his
model
into
which
he
was
feeding
cotton
when
the
colonel
came
up
the
colonel
stood
a
moment
and
looked
at
the
machine
it
quite
ingenious
he
said
explain
the
principle
ben
described
the
mechanism
in
brief
words
which
conveyed
the
thought
clearly
and
concisely
and
revealed
a
fine
mind
for
mechanics
and
at
the
same
time
an
absolute
lack
of
technical
knowledge
it
would
never
be
of
any
use
sir
he
said
at
the
end
for
everybody
has
the
other
kind
but
it
another
way
and
i
think
a
better
it
is
clever
said
the
colonel
thoughtfully
as
he
went
into
the
house
the
colonel
had
not
changed
his
mind
at
all
since
asking
miss
laura
to
be
his
wife
the
glow
of
happiness
still
warmed
her
cheek
the
spirit
of
youth
still
lingered
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
smile
he
might
go
a
thousand
miles
before
meeting
a
woman
who
would
please
him
more
take
better
care
of
phil
or
preside
with
more
dignity
over
his
household
her
simple
grace
would
adapt
itself
to
wealth
as
easily
as
it
had
accommodated
itself
to
poverty
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
travel
with
her
to
new
scenes
and
new
places
to
introduce
her
into
a
wider
world
to
see
her
expand
in
the
generous
sunlight
of
ease
and
freedom
from
responsibility
true
to
his
promise
the
colonel
made
every
effort
to
see
that
bud
johnson
should
be
protected
against
mob
violence
and
given
a
fair
trial
there
was
some
intemperate
talk
among
the
partisans
of
fetters
and
an
ominous
gathering
upon
the
streets
the
day
after
the
arrest
but
judge
miller
of
the
beaver
county
circuit
who
was
in
clarendon
that
day
used
his
influence
to
discountenance
any
disorder
and
promised
a
speedy
trial
of
the
prisoner
the
crime
was
not
the
worst
of
crimes
and
there
was
no
excuse
for
riot
or
lynch
law
the
accused
could
not
escape
his
just
punishment
as
a
result
of
the
judge
efforts
supplemented
by
the
colonel
and
those
of
doctor
price
and
several
ministers
any
serious
fear
of
disorder
was
removed
and
a
handful
of
fetters
guards
who
had
come
up
from
his
convict
farm
and
foregathered
with
some
choice
spirits
of
the
town
at
clay
jackson
saloon
went
back
without
attempting
to
do
what
they
had
avowedly
come
to
town
to
accomplish
one
morning
the
colonel
while
overseeing
the
work
at
the
new
mill
building
stepped
on
the
rounded
handle
of
a
chisel
which
had
been
left
lying
carelessly
on
the
floor
and
slipped
and
fell
spraining
his
ankle
severely
he
went
home
in
his
buggy
which
was
at
the
mill
and
sent
for
doctor
price
who
put
his
foot
in
a
plaster
bandage
and
ordered
him
to
keep
quiet
for
a
week
peter
and
phil
went
around
to
the
treadwells
to
inform
the
ladies
of
the
accident
on
reaching
the
house
after
the
accident
the
colonel
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
sent
peter
to
bring
him
one
from
the
closet
off
his
bedroom
when
the
colonel
put
on
the
coat
he
felt
some
papers
in
the
inside
pocket
and
taking
them
out
recognised
the
two
old
letters
he
had
taken
from
the
lining
of
his
desk
several
months
before
the
housekeeper
in
a
moment
of
unusual
zeal
had
discovered
and
mended
the
tear
in
the
sleeve
and
peter
had
by
chance
selected
this
particular
coat
to
bring
to
his
master
when
peter
started
with
phil
to
go
to
the
treadwells
the
colonel
gave
him
the
two
letters
give
these
he
said
to
miss
laura
and
tell
her
i
found
them
in
the
old
desk
it
was
not
long
before
miss
laura
came
with
graciella
to
call
on
the
colonel
when
they
had
expressed
the
proper
sympathy
and
had
been
assured
that
the
hurt
was
not
dangerous
miss
laura
spoke
of
another
matter
henry
she
said
with
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
i
have
made
a
discovery
i
do
quite
know
what
it
means
or
whether
it
amounts
to
anything
but
in
one
of
the
envelopes
you
sent
me
just
now
there
was
a
paper
signed
by
fetters
i
do
not
know
how
it
could
have
been
left
in
the
desk
we
had
searched
it
years
ago
in
every
nook
and
cranny
and
found
nothing
the
colonel
explained
the
circumstances
of
his
discovery
of
the
papers
but
prudently
refrained
from
mentioning
how
long
ago
they
had
taken
place
miss
laura
handed
him
a
thin
oblong
yellowish
slip
of
paper
which
had
been
folded
in
the
middle
it
was
a
printed
form
upon
which
several
words
had
been
filled
in
with
a
pen
it
was
enclosed
in
this
she
said
handing
him
another
paper
the
colonel
took
the
papers
and
glanced
over
them
mother
thinks
said
miss
laura
anxiously
that
they
are
the
papers
we
were
looking
for
that
prove
that
fetters
was
in
father
debt
the
colonel
had
been
thinking
rapidly
the
papers
were
indeed
a
promissory
note
from
fetters
to
treadwell
and
a
contract
and
memorandum
of
certain
joint
transactions
in
turpentine
and
cotton
futures
the
note
was
dated
twenty
years
back
had
it
been
produced
at
the
time
of
treadwell
death
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
collect
and
would
have
meant
to
his
survivors
the
difference
between
poverty
and
financial
independence
now
it
was
barred
by
the
lapse
of
time
miss
laura
was
waiting
in
eager
expectation
outwardly
calm
her
eyes
were
bright
her
cheeks
were
glowing
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
excitedly
could
he
tell
her
that
this
seemingly
fortunate
accident
was
merely
the
irony
of
fate
a
mere
cruel
reminder
of
a
former
misfortune
no
she
could
not
believe
it
it
has
made
me
happy
henry
she
said
while
he
still
kept
his
eyes
bent
on
the
papers
to
conceal
his
perplexity
it
has
made
me
very
happy
to
think
that
i
may
not
come
to
you
dear
woman
he
thought
you
shall
not
if
the
note
is
not
good
it
shall
be
made
good
laura
he
said
aloud
i
am
no
lawyer
but
caxton
shall
look
at
these
and
i
shall
be
very
much
mistaken
if
they
do
not
bring
you
a
considerable
sum
of
money
say
nothing
about
them
however
until
caxton
reports
he
will
be
here
to
see
me
and
by
you
shall
have
his
opinion
miss
laura
went
away
with
a
radiantly
hopeful
face
and
as
she
and
graciella
went
down
the
street
the
colonel
noted
that
her
step
was
scarcely
less
springy
than
her
niece
it
was
worth
the
amount
of
fetters
old
note
to
make
her
happy
and
since
he
meant
to
give
her
all
that
she
might
want
what
better
way
than
to
do
it
by
means
of
this
bit
of
worthless
paper
it
would
be
a
harmless
deception
and
it
would
save
the
pride
of
three
gentlewomen
with
whom
pride
was
not
a
disease
to
poison
and
scorch
and
blister
but
an
inspiration
to
courtesy
and
kindness
and
right
living
such
a
pride
was
worth
cherishing
even
at
a
sacrifice
which
was
after
all
no
sacrifice
he
had
already
sent
word
to
caxton
of
his
accident
requesting
him
to
call
at
the
house
on
other
business
caxton
came
in
the
afternoon
and
when
the
matter
concerning
which
he
had
come
had
been
disposed
of
colonel
french
produced
fetters
note
caxton
he
said
i
wish
to
pay
this
note
and
let
it
seem
to
have
come
from
fetters
caxton
looked
at
the
note
why
should
you
pay
it
he
asked
i
mean
he
added
noting
a
change
in
the
colonel
expression
why
should
fetters
pay
it
because
it
is
outlawed
he
replied
and
we
could
hardly
expect
him
to
pay
for
anything
he
did
have
to
pay
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
against
it
after
fifteen
years
and
it
older
than
that
much
older
than
that
caxton
made
a
rapid
mental
calculation
that
is
the
law
in
new
york
he
said
but
here
the
statute
begin
to
run
for
twenty
years
the
twenty
years
for
which
this
note
was
given
expires
then
it
is
good
demanded
the
colonel
looking
at
his
watch
it
is
good
said
caxton
provided
there
is
no
defence
to
it
except
the
statute
and
provided
i
can
file
a
petition
on
it
in
the
county
clerk
office
by
four
the
time
at
which
the
office
closes
it
is
now
twenty
minutes
of
four
can
you
make
it
i
try
caxton
since
his
acquaintance
with
colonel
french
had
learned
something
more
about
the
value
of
half
an
hour
than
he
had
ever
before
appreciated
and
here
was
an
opportunity
to
test
his
knowledge
he
literally
ran
the
quarter
of
a
mile
that
lay
between
the
residence
and
the
court
house
to
the
astonishment
of
those
whom
he
passed
some
of
whom
wondered
whether
he
were
crazy
and
others
whether
he
had
committed
a
crime
he
dashed
into
the
office
seized
a
pen
and
the
first
piece
of
paper
handy
and
began
to
write
a
petition
the
clerk
had
stepped
into
the
hall
and
when
he
came
leisurely
in
at
three
minutes
to
four
caxton
discovered
that
he
had
written
his
petition
on
the
back
of
a
blank
marriage
license
he
folded
it
ran
his
pen
through
the
printed
matter
endorsed
it
estate
of
treadwell
fetters
signed
it
with
the
name
of
ellen
treadwell
as
executrix
by
himself
as
her
attorney
swore
to
it
before
the
clerk
and
handed
it
to
that
official
who
raised
his
eyebrows
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
endorsement
now
munroe
said
caxton
if
you
enter
that
on
the
docket
now
as
of
i
be
obliged
to
you
i
rather
have
the
transaction
all
finished
up
while
i
wait
your
fee
need
wait
the
termination
of
the
suit
i
pay
it
now
and
take
a
receipt
for
it
the
clerk
whistled
to
himself
as
he
read
the
petition
in
order
to
make
the
entry
that
an
he
said
it
make
the
old
man
cuss
yes
said
caxton
do
me
a
favour
and
do
say
anything
about
it
for
a
day
or
two
i
do
think
the
suit
will
ever
come
to
trial
on
the
day
following
these
events
the
colonel
on
the
arm
of
old
peter
hobbled
out
upon
his
front
porch
and
seating
himself
in
a
big
rocking
chair
in
front
of
which
a
cushion
had
been
adjusted
for
his
injured
ankle
composed
himself
to
read
some
arrears
of
mail
which
had
come
in
the
day
before
and
over
which
he
had
only
glanced
casually
when
he
was
comfortably
settled
peter
and
phil
walked
down
the
steps
upon
the
lowest
of
which
they
seated
themselves
the
colonel
had
scarcely
begun
to
read
before
he
called
to
the
old
man
peter
he
said
i
wish
you
go
upstairs
and
look
in
my
room
and
bring
me
a
couple
of
cigars
from
the
box
on
my
bureau
the
mild
ones
you
know
peter
yas
suh
i
knows
suh
de
mil
ones
dem
wid
de
gol
ban
now
you
stay
right
hyuh
chile
till
peter
come
back
peter
came
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
in
the
doorway
the
colonel
opened
a
letter
from
kirby
in
which
that
energetic
and
versatile
gentleman
assured
the
colonel
that
he
had
evolved
a
great
scheme
in
which
there
were
millions
for
those
who
would
go
into
it
he
had
already
interested
jerviss
who
had
stated
she
would
be
governed
by
what
the
colonel
did
in
the
matter
the
letter
went
into
some
detail
upon
this
subject
and
then
drifted
off
into
club
and
social
gossip
several
of
the
colonel
friends
had
inquired
particularly
about
him
one
had
regretted
the
loss
to
their
whist
table
another
wanted
the
refusal
of
his
box
at
the
opera
if
he
were
not
coming
back
for
the
winter
i
think
you
missed
in
a
certain
quarter
old
fellow
i
know
a
lady
who
would
be
more
than
delighted
to
see
you
i
am
invited
to
her
house
to
dinner
ostensibly
to
talk
about
our
scheme
in
reality
to
talk
about
you
but
this
is
all
by
the
way
the
business
is
the
thing
take
my
proposition
under
advisement
we
all
made
money
together
before
we
can
make
it
again
my
option
has
ten
days
to
run
wire
me
before
it
is
up
what
reply
to
make
i
know
what
you
say
but
i
want
your
dixit
the
colonel
knew
too
what
his
reply
would
be
and
that
it
would
be
very
different
from
kirby
anticipation
he
would
write
it
he
thought
next
day
so
that
kirby
should
not
be
kept
in
suspense
or
so
that
he
might
have
time
to
enlist
other
capital
in
the
enterprise
the
colonel
felt
really
sorry
to
disappoint
his
good
friends
he
would
write
and
inform
kirby
of
his
plans
including
that
of
his
approaching
marriage
he
had
folded
the
letter
and
laid
it
down
and
had
picked
up
a
newspaper
when
peter
returned
with
the
cigars
and
a
box
of
matches
mars
henry
he
asked
gone
wid
de
chile
phil
replied
the
colonel
looking
toward
the
step
from
which
the
boy
had
disappeared
i
suppose
he
went
round
the
house
mars
phil
o
mars
phil
called
the
old
man
there
was
no
reply
peter
looked
round
the
corner
of
the
house
but
phil
was
nowhere
visible
the
old
man
went
round
to
the
back
yard
and
called
again
but
did
not
find
the
child
i
hyuhs
de

he

he
said
when
he
had
returned
to
the
front
of
the
house
run
up
dere
an
fetch
back
yes
do
peter
returned
the
colonel
he
probably
all
right
but
you
better
see
about
him
little
phil
seeing
his
father
absorbed
in
the
newspaper
and
not
wishing
to
disturb
him
had
amused
himself
by
going
to
the
gate
and
looking
down
the
street
toward
the
railroad
track
he
had
been
doing
this
scarcely
a
moment
when
he
saw
a
black
cat
come
out
of
a
neighbour
gate
and
go
down
the
street
phil
instantly
recalled
uncle
peter
story
of
the
black
cat
perhaps
this
was
the
same
one
phil
had
often
been
warned
about
the
railroad
keep
f
dat
railroad
track
honey
the
old
man
had
repeated
more
than
once
it
as
as
a
gun
and
a
gun
is
widout
lock
stock
er
bairl
i
knowed
a

shot
but
was
ter

folks
so
you
jes
better
keep
dat
railroad
track
chile
but
phil
was
a
child
with
the
making
of
a
man
and
the
wisest
of
men
sometimes
forget
for
the
moment
phil
saw
nothing
but
the
cat
and
wished
for
nothing
more
than
to
talk
to
it
so
phil
unperceived
by
the
colonel
set
out
to
overtake
the
black
cat
the
cat
seemed
in
no
hurry
and
phil
had
very
nearly
caught
up
with
him
or
her
as
the
case
might
be
when
the
black
cat
having
reached
the
railroad
siding
walked
under
a
flat
car
which
stood
there
and
leaping
to
one
of
the
truck
bars
composed
itself
presumably
for
a
nap
in
order
to
get
close
enough
to
the
cat
for
conversational
purposes
phil
stooped
under
the
overhanging
end
of
the
car
and
kneeled
down
beside
the
truck
kitty
kitty
he
called
invitingly
the
black
cat
opened
her
big
yellow
eyes
with
every
evidence
of
lazy
amiability
peter
shuffled
toward
the
corner
as
fast
as
his
rickety
old
limbs
would
carry
him
when
he
reached
the
corner
he
saw
a
car
standing
on
the
track
there
was
a
brakeman
at
one
end
holding
a
coupling
link
in
one
hand
and
a
coupling
pin
in
the
other
his
eye
on
an
engine
and
train
of
cars
only
a
rod
or
two
away
advancing
to
pick
up
the
single
car
at
the
same
moment
peter
caught
sight
of
little
phil
kneeling
under
the
car
at
the
other
end
peter
shouted
but
the
brakeman
was
absorbed
in
his
own
task
which
required
close
attention
in
order
to
assure
his
own
safety
the
engineer
on
the
cab
at
the
other
end
of
the
train
saw
an
old
negro
excitedly
gesticulating
and
pulled
a
lever
mechanically
but
too
late
to
stop
the
momentum
of
the
train
which
was
not
equipped
with
air
brakes
even
if
these
would
have
proved
effective
to
stop
it
in
so
short
a
distance
just
before
the
two
cars
came
together
peter
threw
himself
forward
to
seize
the
child
as
he
did
so
the
cat
sprang
from
the
truck
bar
the
old
man
stumbled
over
the
cat
and
fell
across
the
rail
the
car
moved
only
a
few
feet
but
quite
far
enough
to
work
injury
a
dozen
people
including
the
train
crew
quickly
gathered
willing
hands
drew
them
out
and
laid
them
upon
the
grass
under
the
spreading
elm
at
the
corner
of
the
street
a
judge
a
merchant
and
a
negro
labourer
lifted
old
peter
body
as
tenderly
as
though
it
had
been
that
of
a
beautiful
woman
the
colonel
somewhat
uneasy
he
scarcely
knew
why
had
started
to
limp
painfully
toward
the
corner
when
he
was
met
by
a
messenger
who
informed
him
of
the
accident
forgetting
his
pain
he
hurried
to
the
scene
only
to
find
his
heart
delight
lying
pale
bleeding
and
unconscious
beside
the
old
negro
who
had
sacrificed
his
life
to
save
him
a
doctor
who
had
been
hastily
summoned
pronounced
peter
dead
phil
showed
no
superficial
injury
save
a
cut
upon
the
head
from
which
the
bleeding
was
soon
stanched
a
negro
strong
arms
bore
the
child
to
the
house
while
the
bystanders
remained
about
peter
body
until
the
arrival
of
major
mclean
recently
elected
coroner
who
had
been
promptly
notified
of
the
accident
within
a
few
minutes
after
the
officer
appearance
a
jury
was
summoned
from
among
the
bystanders
the
evidence
of
the
trainmen
and
several
other
witnesses
was
taken
and
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
rendered
there
was
no
suggestion
of
blame
attaching
to
any
one
it
had
been
an
accident
pure
and
simple
which
ordinary
and
reasonable
prudence
could
not
have
foreseen
by
the
colonel
command
the
body
of
his
old
servant
was
then
conveyed
to
the
house
and
laid
out
in
the
front
parlour
every
honour
every
token
of
respect
should
be
paid
to
his
remains
meanwhile
the
colonel
forgetting
his
own
hurt
hovered
with
several
physicians
among
them
doctor
price
around
the
bedside
of
his
child
the
slight
cut
upon
the
head
the
physicians
declared
was
not
of
itself
sufficient
to
account
for
the
rapid
sinking
which
set
in
shortly
after
the
boy
removal
to
the
house
there
had
evidently
been
some
internal
injury
the
nature
of
which
could
not
be
ascertained
phil
remained
unconscious
for
several
hours
but
toward
the
end
of
the
day
opened
his
blue
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
his
father
who
was
sitting
by
the
bedside
papa
he
said
am
i
going
to
die
no
no
phil
said
his
father
hopefully
you
are
going
to
get
well
in
a
few
days
i
hope
phil
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
looked
around
him
curiously
he
gave
no
sign
of
being
in
pain
is
miss
laura
here
yes
phil
she
in
the
next
room
and
will
be
here
in
a
moment
at
that
instant
miss
laura
came
in
and
kissed
him
the
caress
gave
him
pleasure
and
he
smiled
sweetly
in
return
papa
was
uncle
peter
hurt
yes
phil
where
is
he
papa
was
he
hurt
badly
he
is
lying
in
another
room
phil
but
he
is
not
in
any
pain
papa
said
phil
after
a
pause
if
i
should
die
and
if
uncle
peter
should
die
you
remember
your
promise
and
bury
him
near
me
you
dear
yes
phil
he
said
but
you
are
not
going
to
die
but
phil
died
dozing
off
into
a
peaceful
sleep
in
which
he
passed
quietly
away
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
it
required
all
the
father
fortitude
to
sustain
the
blow
with
the
added
agony
of
that
he
himself
had
been
unwittingly
the
cause
of
it
had
he
not
sent
old
peter
into
the
house
the
child
would
not
have
been
left
alone
had
he
kept
his
eye
upon
phil
until
return
the
child
would
not
have
strayed
away
he
had
neglected
his
child
while
the
bruised
and
broken
old
black
man
in
the
room
below
had
given
his
life
to
save
him
he
could
do
nothing
now
to
show
the
child
his
love
or
peter
his
gratitude
and
the
old
man
had
neither
wife
nor
child
in
whom
the
colonel
bounty
might
find
an
object
but
he
would
do
what
he
could
he
would
lay
his
child
body
in
the
old
family
lot
in
the
cemetery
among
the
bones
of
his
ancestors
and
there
too
close
at
hand
old
peter
should
have
honourable
sepulture
it
was
his
due
and
would
be
the
fulfilment
of
little
phil
last
request
the
child
was
laid
out
in
the
parlour
amid
a
mass
of
flowers
miss
laura
for
love
of
him
and
of
the
colonel
with
her
own
hands
prepared
his
little
body
for
the
last
sleep
the
undertaker
who
hovered
around
wished
with
a
conventional
sense
of
fitness
to
remove
old
peter
body
to
a
back
room
but
the
colonel
said
no
they
died
together
together
they
shall
lie
here
and
they
shall
be
buried
together
he
gave
instructions
as
to
the
location
of
the
graves
in
the
cemetery
lot
the
undertaker
looked
thoughtful
i
hope
sir
said
the
undertaker
there
will
be
no
objection
not
customary
there
a
coloured
graveyard
you
might
put
up
a
nice
tombstone
there
and
you
been
away
from
here
a
long
time
sir
if
any
one
objects
said
the
colonel
send
him
to
me
the
lot
is
mine
and
i
shall
do
with
it
as
i
like
my
gave
the
cemetery
to
the
town
old
peter
skin
was
black
but
his
heart
was
white
as
any
man
and
when
a
man
reaches
the
grave
he
is
not
far
from
god
who
is
no
respecter
of
persons
and
in
whose
presence
on
the
judgment
day
many
a
white
man
shall
be
black
and
many
a
black
man
white
the
funeral
was
set
for
the
following
afternoon
the
graves
were
to
be
dug
in
the
morning
the
undertaker
whose
business
was
dependent
upon
public
favour
and
who
therefore
shrank
from
any
step
which
might
affect
his
own
popularity
let
it
be
quietly
known
that
colonel
french
had
given
directions
to
bury
peter
in
oak
cemetery
it
was
inevitable
that
there
should
be
some
question
raised
about
so
novel
a
proceeding
the
colour
line
in
clarendon
as
in
all
southern
towns
was
on
the
surface
at
least
rigidly
drawn
and
extended
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
no
negro
body
had
ever
profaned
the
sacred
soil
of
oak
cemetery
the
protestants
laid
the
matter
before
the
cemetery
trustees
and
a
private
meeting
was
called
in
the
evening
to
consider
the
proposed
interment
white
and
black
worshipped
the
same
god
in
different
churches
there
had
been
a
time
when
coloured
people
filled
the
galleries
of
the
white
churches
and
white
ladies
had
instilled
into
black
children
the
principles
of
religion
and
good
morals
but
as
white
and
black
had
grown
nearer
to
each
other
in
condition
they
had
grown
farther
apart
in
feeling
it
was
difficult
for
the
poor
lady
for
instance
to
patronise
the
children
of
the
negro
or
mulatto
nor
was
the
latter
inclined
to
look
up
to
white
people
who
had
started
in
his
memory
from
a
position
but
little
higher
than
his
own
in
an
era
of
change
the
benefits
gained
thereby
seemed
scarcely
to
offset
the
difficulties
of
readjustment
the
situation
was
complicated
by
a
sense
of
injury
on
both
sides
cherishing
their
theoretical
equality
of
citizenship
which
they
could
neither
enforce
nor
forget
the
negroes
resented
noisly
or
silently
as
prudence
dictated
its
contemptuous
denial
by
the
whites
and
these
viewing
this
shadowy
equality
as
an
insult
to
themselves
had
sought
by
all
the
machinery
of
local
law
to
emphasise
and
perpetuate
their
own
superiority
the
very
word
equality
was
an
offence
society
went
back
to
egypt
and
india
for
its
models
to
break
caste
was
a
greater
sin
than
to
break
any
or
all
of
the
ten
commandments
white
and
coloured
children
studied
the
same
books
in
different
schools
white
and
black
people
rode
on
the
same
trains
in
separate
cars
living
side
by
side
and
meeting
day
by
day
the
law
made
and
administered
by
white
men
had
built
a
wall
between
them
and
white
and
black
buried
their
dead
in
separate
graveyards
not
until
they
reached
god
presence
could
they
stand
side
by
side
in
any
relation
of
equality
there
was
a
negro
graveyard
in
clarendon
where
as
a
matter
of
course
the
coloured
dead
were
buried
it
was
not
an
ideal
locality
the
land
was
low
and
swampy
and
graves
must
be
used
quickly
ere
the
water
collected
in
them
the
graveyard
was
unfenced
and
vagrant
cattle
browsed
upon
its
rank
herbage
the
embankment
of
the
railroad
encroached
upon
one
side
of
it
and
the
passing
engines
sifted
cinders
and
ashes
over
the
graves
but
no
negro
had
ever
thought
of
burying
his
dead
elsewhere
and
if
their
cemetery
was
not
well
kept
up
whose
fault
was
it
but
their
own
the
proposition
therefore
of
a
white
man
even
of
colonel
standing
to
bury
a
negro
in
oak
cemetery
was
bound
to
occasion
comment
if
nothing
more
there
was
indeed
more
several
citizens
objected
to
the
profanation
and
laid
their
protest
before
the
mayor
who
quietly
called
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
cemetery
trustees
of
which
he
was
the
chairman
the
trustees
were
five
in
number
the
board
with
the
single
exception
of
the
mayor
was
and
the
members
had
been
chosen
as
vacancies
occurred
by
death
at
long
intervals
from
among
the
aristocracy
who
had
always
controlled
it
the
mayor
a
member
and
chairman
of
the
board
by
virtue
of
his
office
had
sprung
from
the
same
class
as
fetters
that
of
the
aspiring
poor
whites
who
freed
from
the
moral
incubus
of
slavery
had
by
force
of
numbers
and
ambition
secured
political
control
of
the
state
and
relegated
not
only
the
negroes
but
the
old
master
class
to
political
obscurity
a
shrewd
capable
man
was
the
mayor
who
despised
negroes
and
distrusted
aristocrats
and
had
the
courage
of
his
convictions
he
represented
in
the
meeting
the
protesting
element
of
the
community
gentlemen
he
said
colonel
french
has
ordered
this
negro
to
be
buried
in
oak
cemetery
we
all
appreciate
the
colonel
worth
and
what
he
is
doing
for
the
town
but
he
has
lived
at
the
north
for
many
years
and
has
got
somewhat
out
of
our
way
of
thinking
we
do
not
want
to
buy
the
prosperity
of
this
town
at
the
price
of
our
principles
the
attitude
of
the
white
people
on
the
negro
question
is
fixed
and
determined
for
all
time
and
nothing
can
ever
alter
it
to
bury
this
negro
in
oak
cemetery
is
against
our
principles
the
mayor
statement
of
the
rule
is
quite
correct
replied
old
general
thornton
a
member
of
the
board
and
not
open
to
question
but
all
rules
have
their
exceptions
it
was
against
the
law
for
some
years
before
the
war
to
manumit
a
slave
but
an
exception
to
that
salutary
rule
was
made
in
case
a
negro
should
render
some
great
service
to
the
state
or
the
community
you
will
recall
that
when
in
a
sister
state
a
negro
climbed
the
steep
roof
of
michael
church
and
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
saved
that
historic
structure
the
pride
of
charleston
from
destruction
by
fire
the
muncipality
granted
him
his
freedom
and
we
all
remember
said
darden
another
of
the
trustees
we
all
remember
at
least
i
sure
general
thornton
does
old
sally
who
used
to
belong
to
the
mcrae
family
and
was
a
member
of
the
presbyterian
church
and
who
because
of
her
age
and
infirmities
she
was
hard
of
hearing
and
too
old
to
climb
the
stairs
to
the
gallery
was
given
a
seat
in
front
of
the
pulpit
on
the
main
floor
that
was
all
very
well
replied
the
mayor
stoutly
when
the
negroes
belonged
to
you
and
never
questioned
your
authority
but
times
are
different
now
they
think
themselves
as
good
as
we
are
we
had
them
pretty
well
in
hand
until
colonel
french
came
around
with
his
schools
and
his
high
wages
and
now
they
are
getting
so
fat
and
sassy
that
there
soon
be
no
living
with
them
the
last
election
did
something
but
we
have
to
do
something
more
and
that
soon
to
keep
them
in
their
places
there
one
in
jail
now
alive
who
has
shot
and
disfigured
and
nearly
killed
two
good
white
men
and
such
an
example
of
social
equality
as
burying
one
in
a
white
graveyard
will
demoralise
them
still
further
we
must
preserve
the
purity
and
prestige
of
our
race
and
we
can
only
do
it
by
keeping
the
negroes
down
after
all
said
another
member
the
purity
of
our
race
is
not
apt
to
suffer
very
seriously
from
the
social
equality
of
a
graveyard
and
old
peter
will
be
pretty
effectually
kept
down
wherever
he
is
buried
added
another
these
sallies
provoked
a
smile
which
lightened
the
tension
a
member
suggested
that
colonel
french
be
sent
for
it
seems
a
pity
to
disturb
him
in
his
grief
said
another
it
only
a
couple
of
squares
suggested
another
let
call
in
a
body
and
pay
our
respects
we
can
bring
up
the
matter
incidentally
while
there
the
muscles
of
the
mayor
chin
hardened
colonel
french
has
never
been
at
my
house
he
said
and
i
care
to
seem
to
intrude
come
on
mayor
said
darden
taking
the
official
by
the
arm
these
fine
distinctions
are
not
becoming
in
the
presence
of
death
the
colonel
will
be
glad
to
see
you
the
mayor
could
not
resist
this
mark
of
intimacy
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
old
aristocracy
and
walked
somewhat
proudly
through
the
street
arm
in
arm
with
darden
they
paid
their
respects
to
the
colonel
who
was
bearing
up
with
the
composure
to
be
expected
of
a
man
of
strong
will
and
forceful
character
under
a
grief
of
which
he
was
exquisitely
sensible
touched
by
a
strong
man
emotion
which
nothing
could
conceal
no
one
had
the
heart
to
mention
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
the
object
of
their
visit
and
they
went
away
without
giving
the
colonel
any
inkling
that
his
course
had
been
seriously
criticised
nor
was
the
meeting
resumed
after
they
left
the
house
even
the
mayor
seeming
content
to
let
the
matter
go
by
default
fortune
favoured
caxton
in
the
matter
of
the
note
fetters
was
in
clarendon
the
following
morning
caxton
saw
him
passing
called
him
into
his
office
and
produced
the
note
that
no
good
said
fetters
contemptuously
it
was
outlawed
yesterday
i
suppose
you
allowed
i
forgotten
it
on
the
contrary
i
a
memorandum
of
it
in
my
pocketbook
and
i
struck
it
off
the
list
last
night
i
always
pay
my
lawful
debts
when
they
properly
demanded
if
this
note
had
been
presented
yesterday
i
have
paid
it
it
too
late
it
ai
a
lawful
debt
do
you
really
mean
to
say
fetters
that
you
have
deliberately
robbed
those
poor
women
of
this
money
all
these
years
and
are
not
ashamed
of
it
not
even
when
you
found
out
and
that
you
are
going
to
take
refuge
behind
the
statute
now
see
here
caxton
returned
fetters
without
apparent
emotion
you
want
to
be
careful
about
the
language
you
use
i
might
sue
you
for
slander
you
a
young
man
that
hopes
to
have
a
future
and
live
in
this
county
where
i
expect
to
live
and
have
law
business
done
long
after
some
of
your
present
clients
have
moved
away
i
owe
the
estate
of
john
treadwell
one
cent
you
ought
to
be
lawyer
enough
to
know
that
he
owed
me
money
and
paid
me
with
a
note
i
collected
the
note
i
owed
him
money
and
paid
it
with
a
note
whoever
heard
of
anybody
paying
a
note
that
was
presented
it
a
poor
argument
fetters
you
would
have
let
those
ladies
starve
to
death
before
you
would
have
come
forward
and
paid
that
debt
they
never
asked
me
for
charity
so
i
was
called
on
to
offer
it
and
you
know
now
do
you
that
if
i
paid
the
amount
of
that
note
and
then
it
had
turned
up
afterward
in
somebody
else
hands
i
have
had
to
pay
it
over
again
now
would
i
caxton
could
not
deny
it
fetters
had
robbed
the
treadwell
estate
but
his
argument
was
unanswerable
yes
said
caxton
i
suppose
you
would
i
sorry
for
the
women
said
fetters
and
i
stood
ready
to
pay
that
note
all
these
years
and
it
ai
my
fault
that
it
has
been
presented
now
it
outlawed
and
you
could
expect
a
man
to
just
give
away
that
much
money
it
ai
a
lawful
debt
and
the
law
good
enough
for
me
you
awfully
sorry
for
the
ladies
are
you
said
caxton
with
thinly
veiled
sarcasm
i
surely
am
i
honestly
sorry
for
them
and
you
pay
the
note
if
you
had
to
would
you
asked
caxton
i
surely
would
as
i
say
i
always
pay
my
legal
debts
all
right
said
caxton
triumphantly
then
you
pay
this
i
filed
suit
against
you
yesterday
which
takes
the
case
out
of
the
statute
fetters
concealed
his
discomfiture
well
he
said
with
quiet
malignity
i
nothing
more
to
say
till
i
consult
my
lawyer
but
i
want
to
tell
you
one
thing
you
are
ruining
a
fine
career
by
standing
in
with
this
colonel
french
i
hear
his
son
was
killed
you
can
tell
him
i
say
it
a
judgment
on
him
for
i
hold
him
responsible
for
my
son
condition
he
came
down
here
and
tried
to
demoralise
the
labour
market
he
put
false
notions
in
the
niggers
heads
then
he
got
to
meddling
with
my
business
trying
to
get
away
a
nigger
whose
time
i
had
bought
he
insulted
my
agent
turner
and
came
all
the
way
down
to
sycamore
and
tried
to
bully
me
into
letting
the
nigger
loose
and
of
course
i
would
be
bullied
afterwards
when
i
offered
to
let
the
nigger
go
the
colonel
have
it
so
i
shall
always
believe
he
bribed
one
of
my
men
to
get
the
nigger
off
and
then
turned
him
loose
to
run
amuck
among
the
white
people
and
shoot
my
boy
and
my
overseer
it
was
a
performance
and
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
no
really
white
man
would
treat
another
white
man
so
you
can
tell
him
i
say
it
a
judgment
that
fallen
on
him
and
that
it
not
the
last
one
and
that
he
be
sorrier
yet
that
he
did
stay
where
he
was
with
his
notions
instead
of
comin
back
down
here
to
make
trouble
for
people
that
have
grown
up
with
the
state
and
made
it
what
it
is
caxton
of
course
did
not
deliver
the
message
to
do
so
would
have
been
worse
taste
than
fetters
had
displayed
in
sending
it
having
got
the
best
of
the
encounter
caxton
had
no
objection
to
letting
his
defeated
antagonist
discharge
his
venom
against
the
absent
colonel
who
would
never
know
of
it
and
who
was
already
breasting
the
waves
of
a
sorrow
so
deep
and
so
strong
as
almost
to
overwhelm
him
for
he
had
loved
the
boy
all
his
hopes
had
centred
around
this
beautiful
man
child
who
had
promised
so
much
that
was
good
his
own
future
had
been
planned
with
reference
to
him
now
he
was
dead
and
the
bereaved
father
gave
way
to
his
grief
the
funeral
took
place
next
day
from
the
episcopal
church
in
which
communion
the
little
boy
had
been
baptised
and
of
which
old
peter
had
always
been
an
humble
member
faithfully
appearing
every
sunday
morning
in
his
seat
in
the
gallery
long
after
the
rest
of
his
people
had
deserted
it
for
churches
of
their
own
on
this
occasion
peter
had
for
the
first
time
a
place
on
the
main
floor
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
altar
in
front
of
which
banked
with
flowers
stood
the
white
velvet
casket
which
contained
all
that
was
mortal
of
little
phil
the
same
beautiful
sermon
answered
for
both
in
touching
words
the
rector
a
man
of
culture
taste
and
feeling
and
a
faithful
servant
of
his
master
spoke
of
the
sweet
young
life
brought
to
so
untimely
an
end
and
pointed
the
bereaved
father
to
the
best
source
of
consolation
he
paid
a
brief
tribute
to
the
faithful
servant
and
humble
friend
to
whom
though
black
and
lowly
the
white
people
of
the
town
were
glad
to
pay
this
signal
tribute
of
respect
and
appreciation
for
his
heroic
deed
the
attendance
at
the
funeral
while
it
might
have
been
larger
was
composed
of
the
more
refined
and
cultured
of
the
townspeople
from
whom
indeed
the
church
derived
most
of
its
membership
and
support
and
the
gallery
overflowed
with
coloured
people
whose
hearts
had
warmed
to
the
great
honour
thus
paid
to
one
of
their
race
four
young
white
men
bore
phil
body
and
the
six
pallbearers
of
old
peter
were
from
among
the
best
white
people
of
the
town
the
double
interment
was
made
in
oak
cemetery
simultaneously
both
bodies
were
lowered
to
their
last
simultaneously
ashes
were
consigned
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
the
earth
was
heaped
above
the
graves
the
mound
above
little
phil
was
buried
with
flowers
and
old
peter
was
not
neglected
beyond
the
cemetery
wall
a
few
white
men
of
the
commoner
sort
watched
the
proceedings
from
a
distance
and
eyed
with
grim
hostility
the
negroes
who
had
followed
the
procession
they
had
no
part
nor
parcel
in
this
sentimental
folly
nor
did
they
approve
of
it
in
fact
they
disapproved
of
it
very
decidedly
among
them
was
the
discharged
foreman
jim
green
who
was
pronounced
in
his
denunciation
colonel
french
is
an
enemy
of
his
race
he
declared
to
his
sympathetic
following
he
hires
niggers
when
white
men
are
idle
and
pays
them
more
than
white
men
who
work
are
earning
and
now
he
is
burying
them
with
white
people
when
the
group
around
the
grave
began
to
disperse
the
little
knot
of
disgruntled
spectators
moved
sullenly
away
in
the
evening
they
might
have
been
seen
most
of
them
around
clay
jackson
barroom
turner
the
foreman
at
fetters
convict
farm
was
in
town
that
evening
and
jackson
was
his
favourite
haunt
for
some
reason
turner
was
more
sociable
than
usual
and
liquor
flowed
freely
at
his
expense
there
was
a
great
deal
of
intemperate
talk
concerning
the
negro
in
jail
for
shooting
haines
and
young
fetters
and
concerning
colonel
french
as
the
protector
of
negroes
and
the
enemy
of
white
men
at
the
same
time
that
the
colonel
and
had
returned
to
his
empty
house
to
nurse
his
grief
another
series
of
events
was
drawing
to
a
climax
in
the
dilapidated
house
on
mink
run
even
while
the
preacher
was
saying
the
last
words
over
little
remains
old
malcolm
dudley
illness
had
taken
a
sudden
and
violent
turn
he
had
been
sinking
for
several
days
but
the
decline
had
been
gradual
and
there
had
seemed
no
particular
reason
for
alarm
but
during
the
funeral
exercises
ben
had
begun
to
feel
uneasy
some
obscure
premonition
warned
him
to
hurry
homeward
as
soon
as
the
funeral
was
over
he
spoke
to
price
who
had
been
one
of
the
pallbearers
and
the
doctor
had
promised
to
be
at
mink
run
in
a
little
while
ben
rode
home
as
rapidly
as
he
could
as
he
went
up
the
lane
toward
the
house
a
negro
lad
came
forward
to
take
charge
of
the
tired
horse
and
ben
could
see
from
the
boy
expression
that
he
had
important
information
to
communicate
yo
uncle
is
low
sir
said
the
boy
you
bettah
go
in
see
quick
er
you
be
too
late
dey
ain
nobody
wid
but
ole
aun
viney
ben
hurried
into
the
house
and
to
his
uncle
room
where
malcolm
dudley
lay
dying
outside
the
sun
was
setting
and
his
red
rays
shining
through
the
trees
into
the
open
window
lit
the
stage
for
the
last
scene
of
this
belated
drama
when
ben
entered
the
room
the
sweat
of
death
had
gathered
on
the
old
man
brow
but
his
eyes
clear
with
the
light
of
reason
were
fixed
upon
old
viney
who
stood
by
the
bedside
the
two
were
evidently
so
absorbed
in
their
own
thoughts
as
to
be
oblivious
to
anything
else
and
neither
of
them
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
ben
or
to
the
scared
negro
lad
who
had
followed
him
and
stood
outside
the
door
but
marvellous
to
hear
viney
was
talking
strangely
slowly
thickly
but
passionately
and
distinctly
you
had
me
whipped
she
said
do
you
remember
that
you
had
me
whipped
whipped
whipped
by
a
poor
white
dog
i
had
despised
and
spurned
you
had
said
that
you
loved
me
and
you
had
promised
to
free
me
and
you
had
me
whipped
but
i
have
had
my
revenge
her
voice
shook
with
passion
a
passion
at
which
ben
wondered
that
his
uncle
and
she
had
once
been
young
he
knew
and
that
their
relations
had
once
been
closer
than
those
of
master
and
servant
but
this
outbreak
of
feeling
from
the
wrinkled
old
mulattress
seemed
as
strange
and
weird
to
ben
as
though
a
stone
image
had
waked
to
speech
spellbound
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
listened
to
this
ghost
of
a
voice
long
dead
your
uncle
came
with
the
money
and
left
it
and
went
away
only
he
and
i
knew
where
it
was
but
i
never
told
you
i
could
have
spoken
at
any
time
for
years
but
i
never
told
you
i
have
waited
i
have
waited
for
this
moment
i
have
gone
into
the
woods
and
fields
and
talked
to
myself
by
the
hour
that
i
might
not
forget
how
to
talk
and
i
have
waited
my
turn
and
it
is
here
and
now
ben
hung
breathlessly
upon
her
words
he
drew
back
beyond
her
range
of
vision
lest
she
might
see
him
and
the
spell
be
broken
now
he
thought
she
would
tell
where
the
gold
was
hidden
he
came
she
said
and
left
the
gold
two
heavy
bags
of
it
and
a
letter
for
you
an
hour
later
came
back
and
took
it
all
except
the
letter
the
money
was
here
one
hour
but
in
that
hour
you
had
me
whipped
and
for
that
you
have
spent
years
in
looking
for
nothing
something
that
was
not
here
i
have
had
my
revenge
for
years
i
have
watched
you
look
for
nothing
have
seen
you
waste
your
time
your
property
your
life
your
mind
for
nothing
for
ah
mars
you
had
me
whipped
another
a
shadow
of
reproach
crept
into
the
old
man
eyes
over
which
the
mists
of
death
were
already
gathering
yes
viney
he
whispered
you
have
had
your
revenge
but
i
was
sorry
viney
for
what
i
did
and
you
were
not
and
i
forgive
you
viney
but
you
are
unforgiving
even
in
the
presence
of
death
his
voice
failed
and
his
eyes
closed
for
the
last
time
when
she
saw
that
he
was
dead
by
a
strange
revulsion
of
feeling
the
wall
of
outraged
pride
and
hatred
and
revenge
built
upon
one
brutal
and
bitterly
repented
mistake
and
labouriously
maintained
for
half
a
lifetime
in
her
woman
heart
that
even
slavery
could
not
crush
crumbled
and
fell
and
let
pass
over
it
in
one
great
and
final
flood
the
passions
of
the
past
bursting
into
tears
strange
tears
from
eyes
that
had
long
forgot
to
weep
old
viney
threw
herself
down
upon
her
knees
by
the
bedside
and
seizing
old
malcolm
emaciated
hand
in
both
her
own
covered
it
with
kisses
fervent
kisses
the
ghosts
of
the
passionate
kisses
of
their
distant
youth
with
a
feeling
that
his
presence
was
something
like
sacrilege
ben
stole
away
and
left
her
with
her
dead
the
dead
master
and
the
dead
past
and
thanked
god
that
he
lived
in
another
age
and
had
escaped
this
sin
as
he
wandered
through
the
old
house
a
veil
seemed
to
fall
from
his
eyes
how
old
everything
was
how
shrunken
and
decayed
the
sheen
of
the
hidden
gold
had
gilded
the
dilapidated
old
house
the
neglected
plantation
his
own
barren
life
now
that
it
was
gone
things
appeared
in
their
true
light
fortunately
he
was
young
enough
to
retrieve
much
of
what
had
been
lost
when
the
old
man
was
buried
he
would
settle
the
estate
sell
the
land
make
some
provision
for
aunt
viney
and
then
with
what
was
left
go
out
into
the
world
and
try
to
make
a
place
for
himself
and
graciella
for
life
intrudes
its
claims
even
into
the
presence
of
death
when
the
doctor
came
a
little
later
ben
went
with
him
into
the
death
chamber
viney
was
still
kneeling
by
her
master
bedside
but
strangely
still
and
silent
the
doctor
laid
his
hand
on
hers
and
old
malcolm
which
had
remained
clasped
together
they
are
both
dead
he
declared
i
knew
their
story
my
father
told
it
to
me
many
years
ago
ben
related
what
he
had
overheard
i
not
surprised
said
the
doctor
my
father
attended
her
when
she
had
the
stroke
and
after
he
always
maintained
that
viney
could
speak
if
she
had
wished
to
speak
the
colonel
eyes
were
heavy
with
grief
that
night
and
yet
he
lay
awake
late
and
with
his
sorrow
were
mingled
many
consoling
thoughts
the
people
his
people
had
been
kind
aye
more
than
kind
their
warm
hearts
had
sympathised
with
his
grief
he
had
sometimes
been
impatient
of
their
conservatism
their
narrowness
their
unreasoning
pride
of
opinion
but
in
his
bereavement
they
had
manifested
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
beautiful
to
remember
all
the
days
of
his
life
all
the
people
white
and
black
had
united
to
honour
his
dead
he
had
wished
to
help
them
had
tried
already
he
had
loved
the
town
as
the
home
of
his
ancestors
which
enshrined
their
ashes
he
would
make
of
it
a
monument
to
mark
his
son
resting
place
his
fight
against
fetters
and
what
he
represented
should
take
on
a
new
character
henceforward
it
should
be
a
crusade
to
rescue
from
threatened
barbarism
the
land
which
contained
the
tombs
of
his
loved
ones
nor
would
he
be
alone
in
the
struggle
which
he
now
clearly
foresaw
would
be
a
long
one
the
dear
good
woman
he
had
asked
to
be
his
wife
could
help
him
he
needed
her
clear
spiritual
vision
and
in
his
lifelong
sorrow
he
would
need
her
sympathy
and
companionship
for
she
had
loved
the
child
and
would
share
his
grief
she
knew
the
people
better
than
he
and
was
in
closer
touch
with
them
she
could
help
him
in
his
schemes
of
benevolence
and
suggest
new
ways
to
benefit
the
people
phil
mother
was
buried
far
away
among
her
own
people
could
he
consult
her
he
felt
sure
she
would
prefer
to
remain
there
here
she
would
be
an
alien
note
and
when
laura
died
she
could
lie
with
them
and
still
be
in
her
own
place
have
you
heard
the
news
sir
asked
the
housekeeper
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
no
hughes
what
is
it
they
lynched
the
negro
who
was
in
jail
for
shooting
young
fetters
and
the
other
man
the
colonel
hastily
swallowed
a
cup
of
coffee
and
went
down
town
it
was
only
a
short
walk
already
there
were
excited
crowds
upon
the
street
discussing
the
events
of
the
night
the
colonel
sought
caxton
who
was
just
entering
his
office
they
done
it
said
the
lawyer
so
i
understand
when
did
it
happen
about
one
last
night
a
crowd
came
in
from
sycamore
not
all
at
once
but
by
twos
and
threes
and
got
together
in
clay
saloon
with
ben
green
your
discharged
foreman
and
a
lot
of
other
riffraff
and
went
to
the
sheriff
and
took
the
keys
and
took
johnson
and
carried
him
out
to
where
the
shooting
was
and
spare
me
the
details
he
is
dead
yes
a
rope
a
tree
a
puff
of
smoke
a
flash
of
flame
or
a
barbaric
orgy
of
fire
and
blood
what
matter
which
at
the
end
there
was
a
lump
of
clay
and
a
hundred
murderers
where
there
had
been
one
before
can
we
do
anything
to
punish
crime
we
can
try
and
they
tried
the
colonel
went
to
the
sheriff
the
sheriff
said
he
had
yielded
to
force
but
he
never
would
have
dreamed
of
shooting
to
defend
a
worthless
negro
who
had
maimed
a
good
white
man
had
nearly
killed
another
and
had
declared
a
vendetta
against
the
white
race
by
noon
the
colonel
had
interviewed
as
many
prominent
men
as
he
could
find
and
they
became
increasingly
difficult
to
find
as
it
became
known
that
he
was
seeking
them
the
town
he
said
had
been
disgraced
and
should
redeem
itself
by
prosecuting
the
lynchers
he
may
as
well
have
talked
to
the
empty
air
the
trail
of
fetters
was
all
over
the
town
some
of
the
officials
owed
fetters
money
others
were
under
political
obligations
to
him
others
were
plainly
of
the
opinion
that
the
negro
got
no
more
than
he
deserved
such
a
wretch
was
not
fit
to
live
the
coroner
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
suicide
a
grim
joke
which
evoked
some
laughter
doctor
mckenzie
to
whom
the
colonel
expressed
his
feelings
and
whom
he
asked
to
throw
the
influence
of
his
church
upon
the
side
of
law
and
order
said
it
is
too
bad
i
am
sorry
but
it
is
done
let
it
rest
no
good
can
ever
come
of
stirring
it
up
further
later
in
the
day
there
came
news
that
the
lynchers
after
completing
their
task
had
proceeded
to
the
dudley
plantation
and
whipped
all
the
negroes
who
did
not
learn
of
their
coming
in
time
to
escape
the
claim
being
that
johnson
could
not
have
maintained
himself
in
hiding
without
their
connivance
and
that
they
were
therefore
parties
to
his
crimes
the
colonel
felt
very
much
depressed
when
he
went
to
bed
that
night
and
lay
for
a
long
time
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
problem
that
confronted
him
so
far
he
had
been
beaten
except
in
the
matter
of
the
cotton
mill
which
was
yet
unfinished
his
efforts
in
bud
johnson
behalf
the
only
thing
he
had
undertaken
to
please
the
woman
he
loved
had
proved
abortive
his
promise
to
the
teacher
well
he
had
done
his
part
but
to
no
avail
he
would
be
ashamed
to
meet
taylor
face
to
face
with
what
conscience
could
a
white
man
in
clarendon
ever
again
ask
a
negro
to
disclose
the
name
or
hiding
place
of
a
coloured
criminal
in
the
effort
to
punish
the
lynchers
he
stood
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
alone
and
without
the
support
of
public
opinion
he
could
do
nothing
the
colonel
was
beaten
but
not
dismayed
perhaps
god
in
his
wisdom
had
taken
phil
away
that
his
father
might
give
himself
more
completely
and
to
the
battle
before
him
had
phil
lived
a
father
might
have
hesitated
to
expose
a
child
young
and
impressionable
mind
to
the
things
which
these
volcanic
outbursts
of
passion
between
mismated
races
might
cause
at
any
unforeseen
moment
now
that
the
way
was
clear
he
could
go
forward
hand
in
hand
with
the
good
woman
who
had
promised
to
wed
him
in
the
work
he
had
laid
out
he
would
enlist
good
people
to
demand
better
laws
under
which
fetters
and
his
kind
would
find
it
harder
to
prey
upon
the
weak
diligently
he
would
work
to
lay
wide
and
deep
the
foundations
of
prosperity
education
and
enlightenment
upon
which
should
rest
justice
humanity
and
civic
righteousness
in
this
he
would
find
a
worthy
career
patiently
would
he
await
the
results
of
his
labours
and
if
they
came
not
in
great
measure
in
his
own
lifetime
he
would
be
content
to
know
that
after
years
would
see
their
full
fruition
so
that
night
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
answer
to
kirby
letter
in
which
he
told
him
of
phil
death
and
burial
and
his
own
grief
something
there
was
too
of
his
plans
for
the
future
including
his
marriage
to
a
good
woman
who
would
help
him
in
them
kirby
he
said
had
offered
him
a
golden
opportunity
for
which
he
thanked
him
heartily
the
scheme
was
good
enough
for
any
one
to
venture
upon
but
to
carry
out
his
own
plans
would
require
that
he
invest
his
money
in
the
state
of
his
residence
where
there
were
many
openings
for
capital
that
could
afford
to
wait
upon
development
for
large
returns
he
sent
his
best
regards
to
jerviss
and
his
assurance
that
kirby
plan
was
a
good
one
perhaps
kirby
and
she
alone
could
handle
it
if
not
there
must
be
plenty
of
money
elsewhere
for
so
good
a
thing
he
sealed
the
letter
and
laid
it
aside
to
be
mailed
in
the
morning
to
his
mind
it
had
all
the
force
of
a
final
renunciation
a
severance
of
the
last
link
that
bound
him
to
his
old
life
long
the
colonel
lay
thinking
after
he
retired
to
rest
and
the
muffled
striking
of
the
clock
downstairs
had
marked
the
hour
of
midnight
ere
he
fell
asleep
and
he
had
scarcely
dozed
away
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
scraping
noise
as
though
somewhere
in
the
house
a
heavy
object
was
being
drawn
across
the
floor
the
sound
was
not
repeated
however
and
thinking
it
some
trick
of
the
imagination
he
soon
slept
again
as
the
colonel
slept
this
second
time
he
dreamed
of
a
regenerated
south
filled
with
thriving
industries
and
thronged
with
a
prosperous
and
happy
people
where
every
man
having
enough
for
his
needs
was
willing
that
every
other
man
should
have
the
same
where
law
and
order
should
prevail
unquestioned
and
where
every
man
could
enter
through
the
golden
gate
of
hope
the
field
of
opportunity
where
lay
the
prizes
of
life
which
all
might
have
an
equal
chance
to
win
or
lose
for
even
in
his
dreams
the
colonel
sober
mind
did
not
stray
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
and
experience
that
all
men
would
ever
be
equal
he
did
not
even
dream
there
would
always
be
the
strong
and
the
weak
the
wise
and
the
foolish
but
that
each
man
in
his
little
life
in
this
our
little
world
might
be
able
to
make
the
most
of
himself
was
an
ideal
which
even
the
colonel
waking
hours
would
not
have
repudiated
following
this
pleasing
thread
with
the
unconscious
rapidity
of
dreams
the
colonel
passed
in
a
few
brief
minutes
through
a
long
and
useful
life
to
a
happy
end
when
he
too
rested
with
his
fathers
by
the
side
of
his
son
and
on
his
tomb
was
graven
what
was
said
of
ben
adhem
here
lies
one
who
loved
his
fellow
men
and
the
further
words
and
tried
to
make
them
happy
shortly
after
dawn
there
was
a
loud
rapping
at
the
colonel
door
come
downstairs
and
look
on
de
piazza
colonel
said
the
agitated
voice
of
the
servant
who
had
knocked
come
quick
suh
there
was
a
vague
terror
in
the
man
voice
that
stirred
the
colonel
strangely
he
threw
on
a
dressing
gown
and
hastened
downstairs
and
to
the
front
door
of
the
hall
which
stood
open
a
handsome
mahogany
burial
casket
stained
with
earth
and
disfigured
by
rough
handling
rested
upon
the
floor
of
the
piazza
where
it
had
been
deposited
during
the
night
conspicuously
nailed
to
the
coffin
lid
was
a
sheet
of
white
paper
upon
which
were
some
lines
rudely
scrawled
in
a
handwriting
that
matched
the
spelling
notis
berry
yore
ole
nigger
somewhar
else
he
ca
stay
in
oak
semitury
the
majority
of
the
white
people
of
this
town
who
dident
tend
yore
nigger
funarl
woant
have
him
there
niggers
by
there
selves
white
peepul
by
there
selves
and
them
that
lives
in
our
town
must
bide
by
our
order
cumitty
the
colonel
left
the
coffin
standing
on
the
porch
where
it
remained
all
day
an
object
of
curious
interest
to
the
scores
and
hundreds
who
walked
by
to
look
at
it
for
the
news
spread
quickly
through
the
town
no
one
however
came
in
if
there
were
those
who
reprobated
the
action
they
were
silent
the
mob
spirit
which
had
broken
out
in
the
lynching
of
johnson
still
dominated
the
town
and
no
one
dared
to
speak
against
it
as
soon
as
colonel
french
had
dressed
and
breakfasted
he
drove
over
to
the
cemetery
those
who
had
exhumed
old
peter
remains
had
not
been
unduly
careful
the
carelessly
excavated
earth
had
been
scattered
here
and
there
over
the
lot
the
flowers
on
old
peter
grave
and
that
of
little
phil
had
been
trampled
under
foot
whether
wantonly
or
not
inevitably
in
the
execution
of
the
ghoulish
task
the
colonel
heart
hardened
as
he
stood
by
his
son
grave
then
he
took
a
long
lingering
look
at
the
tombs
of
his
ancestors
and
turned
away
with
an
air
of
finality
from
the
cemetery
he
went
to
the
undertaker
and
left
an
order
thence
to
the
telegraph
office
from
which
he
sent
a
message
to
his
former
partner
in
new
york
and
thence
to
the
treadwells
miss
laura
came
forward
with
outstretched
hands
and
eyes
to
greet
him
henry
she
exclaimed
i
am
shocked
and
sorry
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
nor
do
i
know
what
else
to
say
except
that
the
best
people
do
not
can
not
could
not
approve
of
it
the
best
people
laura
he
said
with
a
weary
smile
are
an
abstraction
when
any
deviltry
is
on
foot
they
are
never
there
to
prevent
it
they
vanish
into
thin
air
at
its
approach
when
it
is
done
they
excuse
it
and
they
make
no
effort
to
punish
it
so
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
what
they
permit
they
justify
and
they
can
not
shirk
the
responsibility
to
mar
the
living
it
is
the
history
of
life
but
to
make
war
upon
the
dead
i
am
going
away
laura
never
to
return
my
dream
of
usefulness
is
over
i
take
away
my
dead
and
shake
the
dust
of
clarendon
from
my
feet
forever
will
you
come
with
me
henry
she
said
and
each
word
tore
her
heart
i
have
been
expecting
this
since
i
heard
but
i
can
not
go
my
duty
calls
me
here
my
mother
could
not
be
happy
anywhere
else
nor
would
i
fit
into
any
other
life
and
here
too
i
am
useful
and
may
still
be
useful
and
should
be
missed
i
know
your
feelings
and
would
not
try
to
keep
you
but
oh
henry
if
all
of
those
who
love
justice
and
practise
humanity
should
go
away
what
would
become
of
us
i
leave
he
returned
and
it
is
your
right
to
go
with
me
or
to
come
to
me
no
henry
nor
am
i
sure
that
you
would
wish
me
to
it
was
for
the
old
town
sake
that
you
loved
me
i
was
a
part
of
your
dream
a
part
of
the
old
and
happy
past
upon
which
you
hoped
to
build
as
upon
the
foundations
of
the
old
mill
a
broader
and
a
fairer
structure
do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
that
night
that
happy
night
that
you
loved
me
because
in
me
you
found
the
embodiment
of
an
ideal
well
henry
that
is
why
i
did
not
wish
to
make
our
engagement
known
for
i
knew
i
felt
the
difficulty
of
your
task
and
i
foresaw
that
you
might
be
disappointed
and
i
feared
that
if
your
ideal
should
be
wrecked
you
might
find
me
a
burden
i
loved
you
henry
i
seem
to
have
always
loved
you
but
i
would
not
burden
you
no
no
laura
not
so
not
so
and
you
wanted
me
for
phil
sake
whom
we
both
loved
and
now
that
your
dream
is
over
and
phil
is
gone
i
should
only
remind
you
of
where
you
lost
him
and
of
your
disappointment
and
of
this
other
thing
and
i
could
not
be
sure
that
you
loved
me
or
wanted
me
surely
you
can
not
doubt
it
laura
his
voice
was
firm
but
to
her
sensitive
spirit
it
did
not
carry
conviction
you
remembered
me
from
my
youth
she
continued
tremulously
but
bravely
and
it
was
the
image
in
your
memory
that
you
loved
and
now
when
you
go
away
the
old
town
will
shrink
and
fade
from
your
memory
and
your
heart
and
you
will
have
none
but
harsh
thoughts
of
it
nor
can
i
blame
you
greatly
for
you
have
grown
far
away
from
us
and
we
shall
need
many
years
to
overtake
you
nor
do
you
need
me
henry
i
am
too
old
to
learn
new
ways
and
elsewhere
than
here
i
should
be
a
hindrance
to
you
rather
than
a
help
but
in
the
larger
life
to
which
you
go
think
of
me
now
and
then
as
one
who
loves
you
still
and
who
will
try
in
her
poor
way
with
such
patience
as
she
has
to
carry
on
the
work
which
you
have
begun
and
which
you
oh
henry
he
divined
her
thought
though
her
eyes
spoke
sorrow
rather
than
reproach
yes
he
said
sadly
which
i
have
abandoned
yes
laura
abandoned
fully
and
forever
the
colonel
was
greatly
moved
but
his
resolution
remained
unshaken
laura
he
said
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
i
swear
that
i
should
be
glad
to
have
you
with
me
come
away
the
place
is
not
fit
for
you
to
live
in
no
henry
it
can
not
be
i
could
not
go
my
duty
holds
me
here
god
would
not
forgive
me
if
i
abandoned
it
go
your
way
live
your
life
marry
some
other
woman
if
you
must
who
will
make
you
happy
but
i
shall
keep
henry
nothing
can
ever
take
away
from
me
the
memory
of
one
happy
summer
no
no
laura
it
need
not
be
so
i
shall
write
you
you
think
better
of
it
but
i
go
not
one
hour
longer
than
i
must
will
i
remain
in
this
town
i
must
bid
your
mother
and
graciella
he
went
into
the
house
treadwell
was
excited
and
sorry
and
would
have
spoken
at
length
but
the
colonel
farewells
were
brief
i
can
not
stop
to
say
more
than
dear
treadwell
i
have
spent
a
few
happy
months
in
my
old
home
and
now
i
am
going
away
laura
will
tell
you
the
rest
graciella
was
tearfully
indignant
it
was
a
shame
she
declared
peter
was
a
good
old
nigger
and
it
would
have
done
anybody
any
harm
to
leave
him
there
i
rather
be
buried
beside
old
peter
than
near
any
of
the
poor
white
trash
that
dug
him
up
so
there
i
so
sorry
you
going
away
but
i
hope
sometime
she
added
stoutly
to
see
you
in
new
york
do
forget
i
send
you
my
address
said
the
colonel
it
was
a
few
weeks
later
old
ralph
dudley
and
viney
had
been
buried
ben
dudley
had
ridden
in
from
mink
run
had
hitched
his
horse
in
the
back
yard
as
usual
and
was
seated
on
the
top
step
of
the
piazza
beside
graciella
his
elbows
rested
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
upon
his
hand
graciella
had
unconsciously
imitated
his
drooping
attitude
both
were
enshrouded
in
the
deepest
gloom
and
had
been
sunk
for
several
minutes
in
a
silence
equally
profound
graciella
was
the
first
to
speak
well
then
she
said
with
a
deep
sigh
there
is
absolutely
nothing
left
not
a
thing
he
groaned
hopelessly
except
my
horse
and
my
clothes
and
a
few
odds
and
ends
which
belong
to
me
fetters
will
have
the
land
there
not
enough
to
pay
the
mortgages
against
it
and
i
in
debt
for
the
funeral
expenses
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
gracious
knows
i
wish
i
did
i
came
over
to
consult
the
family
i
have
no
trade
no
profession
no
land
and
no
money
i
can
get
a
job
at
braking
on
the
railroad
or
may
be
at
clerking
in
a
store
i
have
asked
the
colonel
for
something
in
the
mill
but
that
chance
is
gone
gone
echoed
graciella
gloomily
i
see
my
fate
i
shall
marry
you
because
i
ca
help
loving
you
and
could
live
without
you
and
i
shall
never
get
to
new
york
but
be
all
my
life
a
poor
man
wife
a
poor
white
man
wife
no
graciella
we
might
be
poor
but
not
our
blood
will
still
be
of
the
best
it
will
be
all
the
same
blood
without
money
may
count
for
one
generation
but
it
wo
hold
out
for
two
they
relapsed
into
a
gloom
so
profound
so
rayless
that
they
might
almost
be
said
to
have
reveled
in
it
it
was
lightened
or
at
least
a
diversion
was
created
by
miss
laura
opening
the
garden
gate
and
coming
up
the
walk
ben
rose
as
she
approached
and
graciella
looked
up
i
have
been
to
the
said
miss
laura
here
is
a
letter
for
you
ben
addressed
in
my
care
it
has
the
new
york
postmark
thank
you
miss
laura
eagerly
ben
hand
tore
the
envelope
and
drew
out
the
enclosure
swiftly
his
eyes
devoured
the
lines
they
were
typewritten
and
easy
to
follow
glory
he
shouted
glory
hallelujah
listen
he
read
the
letter
aloud
while
graciella
leaned
against
his
shoulder
and
feasted
her
eyes
upon
the
words
the
letter
was
from
colonel
french
my
dear
was
very
much
impressed
with
the
model
of
a
cotton
gin
and
press
which
i
saw
you
exhibit
one
day
at
treadwells
you
have
a
fine
genius
for
mechanics
and
the
model
embodies
i
think
a
clever
idea
which
is
worth
working
up
if
your
uncle
death
has
left
you
free
to
dispose
of
your
time
i
should
like
to
have
you
come
on
to
new
york
with
the
model
and
we
will
take
steps
to
have
the
invention
patented
at
once
and
form
a
company
for
its
manufacture
as
an
evidence
of
good
faith
i
enclose
my
draft
for
five
hundred
dollars
which
can
be
properly
accounted
for
in
our
future
o
ben
gasped
graciella
in
one
long
drawn
out
ecstatic
sigh
o
graciella
exclaimed
ben
as
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
rapturously
regardless
of
miss
laura
presence
now
you
can
go
to
new
york
as
soon
as
you
like
colonel
french
took
his
dead
to
the
north
and
buried
both
the
little
boy
and
the
old
servant
in
the
same
lot
with
his
young
wife
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
stately
mausoleum
which
marked
her
there
surrounded
by
the
monuments
of
the
rich
and
the
great
in
a
beautiful
cemetery
which
overlooks
a
noble
harbour
where
the
ships
of
all
nations
move
in
endless
procession
the
body
of
the
faithful
servant
rests
beside
that
of
the
dear
little
child
whom
he
unwittingly
lured
to
his
death
and
then
died
in
the
effort
to
save
and
in
all
the
great
company
of
those
who
have
laid
their
dead
there
in
love
or
in
honour
there
is
none
to
question
old
peter
presence
or
the
colonel
right
to
lay
him
there
sometimes
at
night
a
ray
of
light
from
the
uplifted
torch
of
the
statue
of
liberty
the
gift
of
a
free
people
to
a
free
people
falls
athwart
the
white
stone
which
marks
his
resting
place
fit
prophecy
and
omen
of
the
day
when
the
sun
of
liberty
shall
shine
alike
upon
all
men
when
the
colonel
went
away
from
clarendon
he
left
his
affairs
in
caxton
hands
with
instructions
to
settle
them
up
as
expeditiously
as
possible
the
cotton
mill
project
was
dropped
and
existing
contracts
closed
on
the
best
terms
available
fetters
paid
the
old
note
even
he
would
not
have
escaped
odium
for
so
a
robbery
and
treadwell
last
days
could
be
spent
in
comfort
and
miss
laura
saved
from
any
fear
for
her
future
and
enabled
to
give
more
freely
to
the
poor
and
needy
barclay
fetters
recovered
the
use
of
one
eye
and
embittered
against
the
whole
negro
race
by
his
disfigurement
went
into
public
life
and
devoted
his
talents
and
his
education
to
their
debasement
the
colonel
had
relented
sufficiently
to
contemplate
making
over
to
miss
laura
the
old
family
residence
in
trust
for
use
as
a
hospital
with
a
suitable
fund
for
its
maintenance
but
it
unfortunately
caught
fire
and
burned
down
and
he
was
hardly
sorry
he
sent
catherine
bud
johnson
wife
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
she
bought
a
gorgeous
suit
of
mourning
and
after
a
decent
interval
consoled
herself
with
a
new
husband
and
he
sent
word
to
the
committee
of
coloured
men
to
whom
he
had
made
a
definite
promise
that
he
would
be
ready
to
fulfil
his
obligation
in
regard
to
their
school
whenever
they
should
have
met
the
conditions
one
day
a
year
or
two
after
leaving
clarendon
as
the
colonel
in
company
with
french
formerly
a
member
of
his
firm
now
his
partner
in
a
double
sense
was
riding
upon
a
fast
train
between
new
york
and
chicago
upon
a
trip
to
visit
a
western
mine
in
which
the
reorganised
french
and
company
limited
were
interested
he
noticed
that
the
pullman
car
porter
a
tall
and
stalwart
negro
was
watching
him
furtively
from
time
to
time
upon
one
occasion
when
the
colonel
was
alone
in
the
the
porter
addressed
him
excuse
me
suh
he
said
i
been
wondering
ever
since
we
left
new
york
if
you
colonel
french
yes
i
french
colonel
french
if
you
want
it
so
i
it
must
be
you
suh
though
you
changed
the
cut
of
your
beard
and
are
looking
a
little
older
suh
i
do
suppose
you
remember
me
i
seen
you
somewhere
said
the
colonel
no
longer
the
colonel
but
like
the
porter
let
us
have
it
so
where
was
it
i
henry
taylor
suh
that
used
to
teach
school
at
clarendon
i
reckon
you
remember
me
now
yes
said
the
colonel
sadly
i
remember
you
now
taylor
to
my
sorrow
i
did
keep
my
word
about
johnson
did
i
oh
yes
suh
replied
the
porter
i
never
doubted
but
what
keep
your
word
but
you
see
suh
they
were
too
many
for
you
there
ai
no
one
man
can
stop
them
folks
down
there
when
they
once
get
started
and
what
are
you
doing
here
taylor
well
suh
the
fact
is
that
after
you
went
away
it
got
out
somehow
that
i
had
told
on
bud
johnson
i
do
know
how
they
learned
it
and
of
course
i
knew
you
did
tell
it
but
somebody
must
have
seen
me
going
to
your
house
or
else
some
of
my
enemies
guessed
it
and
happened
to
guess
right
and
after
that
the
coloured
folks
send
their
children
to
me
and
i
lost
my
job
and
was
able
to
get
another
anywhere
in
the
state
the
folks
said
i
was
an
enemy
of
my
race
and
what
was
more
important
to
me
i
found
that
my
race
was
an
enemy
to
me
so
i
got
out
suh
and
i
came
hoping
to
find
somethin
better
this
is
the
best
job
i
struck
yet
but
i
hoping
that
sometime
or
other
i
find
something
worth
while
and
what
became
of
the
industrial
school
project
asked
the
colonel
i
stood
ready
to
keep
my
promise
and
more
but
i
never
heard
from
you
well
suh
after
you
went
away
the
enthusiasm
kind
of
died
out
and
some
of
the
white
folks
throwed
cold
water
on
it
and
it
fell
through
suh
when
the
porter
came
along
before
the
train
reached
chicago
the
colonel
offered
taylor
a
handsome
tip
thank
you
suh
said
the
porter
but
i
rather
not
take
it
i
a
porter
now
but
i
always
one
and
hope
i
wo
always
be
one
and
during
all
the
time
i
taught
school
in
clarendon
you
was
the
only
white
man
that
ever
treated
me
quite
like
a
man
and
our
folks
just
like
people
and
if
you
wo
think
i
presuming
i
rather
not
take
the
money
the
colonel
shook
hands
with
him
and
took
his
address
shortly
afterward
he
was
able
to
find
him
something
better
than
menial
employment
where
his
education
would
give
him
an
opportunity
for
advancement
taylor
is
fully
convinced
that
his
people
will
never
get
very
far
along
in
the
world
without
the
good
will
of
the
white
people
but
he
is
still
wondering
how
they
will
secure
it
for
he
regards
colonel
french
as
an
extremely
fortunate
accident
and
so
the
colonel
faltered
and
having
put
his
hand
to
the
plow
turned
back
but
was
not
his
after
all
the
only
way
for
no
more
now
than
when
the
man
of
sorrows
looked
out
over
the
mount
of
olives
can
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
the
seed
which
the
colonel
sowed
seemed
to
fall
by
the
wayside
it
is
true
but
other
eyes
have
seen
with
the
same
light
and
while
fetters
and
his
kind
still
dominate
their
section
other
hands
have
taken
up
the
fight
which
the
colonel
dropped
in
manufactures
the
south
has
gone
forward
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
strong
arm
of
the
government
guided
by
a
wise
and
just
executive
has
been
reached
out
to
crush
the
poisonous
growth
of
peonage
and
men
hitherto
silent
have
raised
their
voices
to
commend
here
and
there
a
brave
judge
has
condemned
the
infamy
of
the
and
convict
lease
systems
good
men
north
and
south
have
banded
themselves
together
to
promote
the
cause
of
popular
education
slowly
like
all
great
social
changes
but
visibly
to
the
eye
of
faith
is
growing
up
a
new
body
of
thought
favourable
to
just
laws
and
their
orderly
administration
in
this
changed
attitude
of
mind
lies
the
hope
of
the
future
the
hope
of
the
republic
but
clarendon
has
had
its
chance
nor
seems
yet
to
have
had
another
other
towns
some
not
far
from
it
lying
nearer
the
main
lines
of
travel
have
been
swept
into
the
current
of
modern
life
but
not
yet
clarendon
there
the
grass
grows
thicker
in
the
streets
the
meditative
cows
still
graze
in
the
vacant
lot
between
the
and
the
bank
where
the
public
library
was
to
stand
the
old
academy
has
grown
more
dilapidated
than
ever
and
a
large
section
of
plaster
has
fallen
from
the
wall
carrying
with
it
the
pencil
drawing
made
in
the
colonel
schooldays
and
if
miss
laura
treadwell
sees
that
the
graves
of
the
old
frenches
are
not
allowed
to
grow
up
in
weeds
and
grass
the
colonel
knows
nothing
of
it
the
pigs
and
the
loafers
leaner
pigs
and
lazier
loafers
still
sleep
in
the
shade
when
the
pound
keeper
and
the
constable
are
not
active
the
limpid
water
of
the
creek
still
murmurs
down
the
slope
and
ripples
over
the
stone
foundation
of
what
was
to
have
been
the
new
dam
while
the
birds
have
nested
for
some
years
in
the
vines
that
soon
overgrew
the
unfinished
walls
of
the
colonel
cotton
mill
white
men
go
their
way
and
black
men
theirs
and
these
ways
grow
wider
apart
and
no
one
knows
the
outcome
but
there
are
those
who
hope
and
those
who
pray
that
this
condition
will
pass
that
some
day
our
whole
land
will
be
truly
free
and
the
strong
will
cheerfully
help
to
bear
the
burdens
of
the
weak
and
justice
the
seed
and
peace
the
flower
of
liberty
will
prevail
throughout
all
our
borders
