the

hunger
book
i
chapter
i
for
sheer
havoc
there
is
no
gale
like
a
good
northwester
when
it
roars
in
through
the
long
winter
evenings
driving
the
spindrift
before
it
between
the
rocky
walls
of
the
fjord
it
churns
the
water
to
a
froth
of
rushing
wave
crests
while
the
boats
along
the
beach
are
flung
in
somersaults
up
to
the
doors
of
the
grey
fisher
huts
and
solid
old
barn
gangways
are
lifted
and
sent
flying
like
unwieldy
birds
over
the
fields
mercy
on
us
cry
the
maids
for
it
is
and
they
have
to
fight
their
way
on
hands
and
knees
across
the
yard
to
the
cowshed
dragging
a
lantern
that
will
go
out
and
a
that
won
t
be
held
and
lord
preserve
us
mutter
the
old
wives
seated
round
the
stove
within
doors
and
their
thoughts
are
far
away
in
the
north
with
the
lofoten
fishermen
out
at
sea
maybe
this
very
night
but
on
a
calm
spring
day
the
fjord
just
steals
in
smooth
and
shining
by
ness
and
bay
and
at
low
water
there
is
a
whole
wonderland
of
strange
little
islands
and
rocks
left
high
and
dry
with
clear
pools
between
where
urchins
splash
about
and
tiny
as
big
as
a
halfpenny
dart
away
to
every
side
the
air
is
filled
with
a
smell
of
salt
and
warm
wet
and
the
about
on
a
big
stone
in
the
water
lifts
his
red
beak
cheerily
sunwards
and
pipes
kluip
kluip
the
spring
has
come
on
just
such
a
day
two
boys
of
fourteen
or
thereabouts
came
hurrying
out
from
one
of
the
fishermen
s
huts
down
towards
the
beach
boys
are
never
so
busy
as
when
they
are
up
to
some
piece
of
mischief
and
evidently
the
pair
had
business
of
this
sort
in
hand
peer
troen
and
was
pushing
a
wheelbarrow
his
companion
martin
bruvold
a
dark
youth
with
freckles
carried
a
tub
and
both
talked
mysteriously
in
whispers
casting
anxious
glances
out
over
the
water
peer
troen
was
of
course
the
ringleader
that
he
always
was
the
forest
fire
of
last
year
was
laid
at
his
door
and
now
he
had
made
it
clear
to
some
of
his
friends
that
boys
had
just
as
much
right
to
lay
out
lines
as
men
all
through
the
winter
they
had
been
kept
at
work
cutting
peat
and
carrying
wood
why
should
they
be
left
now
to
fool
about
with
the
inshore
fishing
and
bring
home
nothing
better
than
flounders
and
and
silly
codlings
the
big
line
they
were
forbidden
to
touch
that
was
so
but
the
lofoten
fishery
was
at
its
height
and
none
of
the
men
would
be
back
till
it
was
over
so
the
boys
had
baited
up
the
line
on
the
sly
down
at
the
boathouse
the
day
before
and
laid
it
out
across
the
deepest
part
of
the
fjord
now
the
thing
about
a
line
is
that
it
may
bring
to
the
surface
fish
so
big
and
so
fearsome
that
the
like
has
never
been
seen
before
yesterday
however
there
had
been
trouble
of
a
different
sort
to
their
dismay
the
boys
had
found
that
they
had
not
sinkers
enough
to
weight
the
shore
end
of
the
line
and
it
looked
as
if
they
might
have
to
give
up
the
whole
thing
but
peer
ever
ready
had
hit
on
the
novel
idea
of
making
one
end
fast
to
the
trunk
of
a
small
fir
growing
at
the
outermost
point
of
the
ness
and
carrying
the
line
from
there
out
over
the
open
fjord
then
a
stone
at
the
farther
end
and
with
the
magic
words
fie
fish
it
was
paid
out
overboard
vanishing
into
the
green
depths
the
deed
was
done
true
there
were
a
couple
of
hooks
dangling
in
at
the
shore
end
between
the
tree
and
the
water
and
while
they
might
serve
to
catch
an
eider
duck
or
a
guillemot
if
any
one
should
chance
to
come
rowing
past
in
the
dark
and
get
hung
up
why
the
boys
might
find
they
had
made
a
human
catch
no
wonder
then
that
they
whispered
eagerly
and
hurried
down
to
the
boat
here
comes
peter
ronningen
cried
martin
suddenly
this
was
the
third
member
of
the
crew
a
lanky
youth
with
whitish
eyebrows
and
a
foolish
face
he
stammered
and
made
a
queer
noise
when
he
laughed
twice
he
had
been
turned
down
in
the
confirmation
classes
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
learning
lessons
out
of
a
book
when
nobody
ever
had
patience
to
wait
while
he
said
them
together
they
ran
the
boat
down
to
the
water
s
edge
got
it
afloat
and
scrambled
in
with
much
waving
of
patched
trouser
legs
hi
cried
a
voice
up
on
the
beach
let
me
come
too
there
s
klaus
said
martin
shall
we
take
him
along
no
said
peter
ronningen
oh
yes
let
s
said
peer
klaus
brock
the
son
of
the
district
doctor
was
a
youngster
in
knickerbockers
and
a
sailor
blouse
he
was
playing
truant
no
doubt
klaus
had
his
lessons
at
home
with
a
private
tutor
and
would
certainly
get
a
thrashing
from
his
father
when
he
got
home
hurry
up
called
peer
getting
out
an
oar
klaus
clambered
in
and
the
surged
across
the
bay
rocking
a
little
as
the
boys
pulled
out
of
stroke
martin
was
rowing
at
the
bow
his
eyes
fixed
on
peer
who
sat
in
the
stern
in
command
with
his
eyes
dancing
full
of
great
things
to
be
done
martin
poor
fellow
was
half
afraid
already
he
never
could
understand
why
peer
who
was
to
be
a
parson
when
he
grew
up
was
always
hitting
upon
things
to
do
that
were
evidently
sinful
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
peer
was
a
town
boy
who
had
been
put
out
to
board
with
a
fisherman
in
the
village
his
mother
had
been
no
better
than
she
should
be
so
people
said
but
she
was
dead
now
and
the
father
at
any
rate
must
be
a
rich
gentleman
for
he
sent
the
boy
a
present
of
ten
whole
crowns
every
christmas
so
that
peer
always
had
money
in
his
pocket
naturally
then
he
was
looked
up
to
by
the
other
boys
and
took
the
lead
in
all
things
as
a
chieftain
by
right
the
boat
moved
on
past
the
grey
rocks
the
beach
and
the
huts
above
it
growing
blue
and
faint
in
the
distance
up
among
the
distant
hills
a
red
wooden
on
its
white
foundation
wall
stood
out
clear
here
was
the
ness
at
last
and
there
stood
the
fir
peer
climbed
up
and
loosed
the
end
of
the
line
while
the
others
leaned
over
the
side
watching
the
cord
where
it
vanished
in
the
depths
what
would
it
bring
to
light
when
it
came
up
row
ordered
peer
and
began
hauling
in
the
boat
was
headed
straight
out
across
the
fjord
and
the
long
line
with
its
trailing
hooks
hauled
in
and
coiled
up
neatly
in
the
bottom
of
a
shallow
tub
peer
s
heart
was
beating
there
came
a
tug
the
first
and
the
faint
shimmer
of
a
fish
deep
down
in
the
water
pooh
only
a
big
cod
peer
heaved
it
in
with
a
careless
swing
over
the
gunwale
next
came
a
ling
a
deep
water
fish
at
any
rate
this
time
then
a
tusk
and
another
and
another
these
would
please
the
women
being
good
eating
and
perhaps
make
them
hold
their
tongues
when
the
men
came
home
now
the
line
jerks
heavily
what
is
coming
a
grey
shadow
comes
in
sight
here
with
the
gaff
cries
peer
and
peter
throws
it
across
to
him
what
is
it
what
is
it
shriek
the
other
three
steady
don
t
upset
the
boat
a
a
stroke
of
the
gaff
over
the
side
and
a
clumsy
grey
body
is
heaved
into
the
boat
where
it
rolls
about
hissing
and
biting
at
the
and
baler
the
splinters
crackling
under
its
teeth
mind
mind
cries
klaus
he
was
always
nervous
in
a
boat
but
peer
was
hauling
in
again
they
were
nearly
across
the
fjord
by
now
and
the
line
came
up
from
mysterious
depths
which
no
fisherman
had
ever
sounded
the
strain
on
peer
began
to
show
in
his
looks
the
others
sat
watching
his
face
is
the
line
heavy
asked
klaus
keep
still
can
t
you
put
in
martin
glancing
along
the
slanting
line
to
where
it
vanished
far
below
peer
was
still
hauling
a
sense
of
something
uncanny
seemed
to
be
thrilling
up
into
his
hands
from
the
deep
sea
the
feel
of
the
line
was
strange
there
was
no
great
weight
not
even
the
clean
of
an
ordinary
fish
it
was
as
if
a
giant
hand
were
pulling
gently
very
gently
to
draw
him
overboard
and
down
into
the
depths
then
suddenly
a
violent
jerk
almost
dragged
him
over
the
side
look
out
what
is
it
cried
the
three
together
sit
down
in
the
boat
shouted
peer
and
with
the
true
fisherman
s
sense
of
discipline
they
obeyed
peer
was
gripping
the
line
firmly
with
one
hand
the
other
clutching
one
of
the
thwarts
have
we
another
gaff
he
jerked
out
breathlessly
here
s
peter
ronningen
pulled
out
a
second
cudgel
you
take
it
martin
and
stand
but
what
what
is
it
don
t
know
what
it
is
but
it
s
something
cut
the
line
and
row
for
your
lives
wailed
the
doctor
s
son
strange
he
should
be
such
a
coward
at
sea
a
fellow
who
d
tackle
a
man
twice
his
size
on
dry
land
once
more
peer
was
jerked
almost
overboard
he
thought
of
the
forest
fire
the
year
before
it
would
never
do
to
have
another
such
mishap
on
his
shoulders
suppose
the
great
monster
did
come
up
and
capsize
them
they
were
ever
so
far
from
land
what
a
to
do
there
would
be
if
they
were
all
drowned
and
it
came
out
that
it
was
his
fault
involuntarily
he
felt
for
his
knife
to
cut
the
line
then
thrust
it
back
again
and
went
on
hauling
here
it
comes
a
great
shadow
heaving
up
through
the
water
the
huge
beast
flings
itself
round
sending
a
flurry
of
bubbles
to
the
surface
and
there
a
gleam
of
white
a
row
of
great
white
teeth
on
the
underside
aha
now
he
knows
what
it
is
the
greenland
shark
is
the
fiercest
monster
of
the
northern
seas
quite
able
to
make
short
work
of
a
few
boys
or
so
steady
now
martin
ready
with
the
the
brute
was
wallowing
on
the
surface
now
the
water
boiling
around
him
his
tail
lashed
the
sea
to
foam
a
big
pointed
head
showed
up
squirming
under
the
hook
now
cried
peer
and
two
gaffs
struck
at
the
same
moment
the
boat
heeled
over
letting
in
a
rush
of
water
and
klaus
dropping
his
oars
sprang
into
the
bow
with
a
cry
of
jesus
save
us
next
second
a
heavy
body
big
as
a
grown
man
was
heaved
in
over
the
gunwale
and
two
boys
were
all
but
shot
out
the
other
way
and
now
the
fun
began
the
boys
loosed
their
hold
of
the
gaffs
and
sprang
apart
to
give
the
creature
room
there
it
lay
raging
the
great
black
beast
of
prey
with
its
sharp
threatening
snout
and
wicked
red
eyes
ablaze
the
strong
tail
lashed
out
hurling
oars
and
balers
overboard
the
long
teeth
snapped
at
the
and
thwarts
now
and
again
it
would
leap
high
up
in
the
air
only
to
fall
back
again
writhing
furiously
hissing
and
spitting
and
frothing
at
the
mouth
its
red
eyes
glaring
from
one
to
another
of
the
terrified
captors
as
if
saying
come
on
just
a
little
nearer
meanwhile
martin
bruvold
was
in
terror
that
the
shark
would
smash
the
boat
to
pieces
he
drew
his
knife
and
took
a
step
forward
a
flash
in
the
air
and
the
steel
went
in
deep
between
the
back
fins
sending
up
a
spurt
of
blood
look
out
cried
the
others
but
martin
had
already
sprung
back
out
of
reach
of
the
black
tail
and
now
the
dance
of
death
began
anew
the
knife
was
fixed
to
the
grip
in
the
creature
s
back
one
gaff
had
buried
its
hook
between
the
eyes
and
another
hung
on
the
flank
the
wooden
shafts
were
flung
this
way
and
that
at
every
bound
and
the
boat
s
frame
shook
and
groaned
under
the
blows
she
ll
smash
the
boat
and
we
ll
go
to
the
bottom
cried
peer
and
now
his
knife
flashed
out
and
sent
a
stream
of
blood
spouting
from
between
the
shoulders
but
the
blow
cost
him
his
foothold
and
in
a
moment
the
two
bodies
were
rolling
over
and
over
together
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
oh
lord
jesus
shrieked
klaus
clinging
to
the
stempost
she
ll
kill
him
she
ll
kill
him
peer
was
half
up
now
on
his
knees
but
as
he
reached
out
a
hand
to
grasp
the
side
the
brute
s
jaws
seized
on
his
arm
the
boy
s
face
was
contorted
with
pain
another
moment
and
the
sharp
teeth
would
have
bitten
through
when
swift
as
thought
peter
ronningen
dropped
his
oars
and
sent
his
knife
straight
in
between
the
beast
s
eyes
the
blade
pierced
through
to
the
brain
and
the
grip
of
the
teeth
relaxed
stammered
peter
as
he
scrambled
back
to
his
oars
another
moment
and
peer
had
dragged
himself
clear
and
was
kneeling
by
the
forward
thwart
holding
the
ragged
sleeve
of
his
wounded
arm
while
the
blood
trickled
through
his
fingers
when
at
last
they
were
pulling
homeward
the
little
boat
overloaded
with
the
weight
of
the
great
carcase
all
at
once
they
stopped
rowing
where
is
klaus
asked
peer
for
the
doctor
s
son
was
gone
from
where
he
had
sat
clinging
to
the
stem
why
there
he
is
in
the
bottom
there
lay
the
big
lout
of
fifteen
who
already
boasted
of
his
learned
german
and
was
to
be
a
gentleman
like
his
father
there
he
lay
on
the
in
the
bow
in
a
dead
faint
the
others
were
frightened
at
first
but
peer
who
was
sitting
washing
his
wounded
arm
took
a
dipper
full
of
water
and
flung
it
in
the
unconscious
one
s
face
the
next
instant
klaus
had
started
up
sitting
caught
wildly
at
the
gunwale
and
shrieked
out
cut
the
line
and
row
for
your
lives
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
rest
they
dropped
their
oars
and
sat
doubled
up
and
gasping
but
on
the
beach
before
going
home
they
agreed
to
say
nothing
about
klaus
s
fainting
fit
and
for
weeks
afterwards
the
four
scamps
exploit
was
the
talk
of
the
village
so
that
they
felt
there
was
not
much
fear
of
their
getting
the
thrashing
they
deserved
when
the
men
came
home
chapter
ii
when
peer
as
quite
a
little
fellow
had
been
sent
to
live
with
the
old
couple
at
troen
he
had
already
passed
several
times
from
one
adopted
home
to
another
though
this
he
did
not
remember
he
was
one
of
the
madcaps
of
the
village
now
but
it
was
not
long
since
he
had
been
a
solitary
child
moping
apart
from
the
rest
why
did
people
always
say
poor
child
whenever
they
were
speaking
about
his
real
mother
why
did
they
do
it
why
even
peter
ronningen
when
he
was
angry
would
stammer
out
you
but
peer
called
the
at
troen
mother
and
her
husband
father
and
lent
the
old
man
a
hand
wherever
he
was
wanted
in
the
smithy
or
in
the
boats
at
the
fishing
his
childhood
was
passed
among
folk
who
counted
it
sinful
to
smile
and
whose
minds
were
gloomy
as
the
grey
with
poverty
and
the
fear
of
hell
one
day
coming
home
from
his
work
at
the
peat
bog
he
found
the
elders
snuffling
and
sighing
over
their
afternoon
meal
peer
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
the
eldest
son
shoved
a
spoonful
of
porridge
into
his
mouth
wiped
his
eyes
swallowed
and
said
poor
peer
aye
poor
little
chap
sighed
the
old
man
thrusting
his
horn
spoon
into
a
crack
in
the
wall
that
served
as
a
rack
neither
father
nor
mother
now
whimpered
the
eldest
daughter
looking
over
to
the
window
mother
is
she
ay
dearie
yes
sighed
the
old
woman
she
s
gone
for
sure
gone
to
meet
her
later
as
the
day
went
on
peer
tried
to
cry
too
the
worst
thing
of
all
was
that
every
one
in
the
house
seemed
so
perfectly
certain
where
his
mother
had
gone
to
and
to
heaven
it
certainly
was
not
but
how
could
they
be
so
sure
about
it
peer
had
seen
her
only
once
one
summer
s
day
when
she
had
come
out
to
see
the
place
she
wore
a
light
dress
and
a
big
straw
hat
and
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
before
she
made
no
secret
of
it
among
the
neighbours
that
peer
was
not
her
only
child
there
was
a
little
girl
too
named
louise
who
was
with
some
folks
away
up
in
the
inland
parishes
she
was
in
high
spirits
and
told
risky
stories
and
sang
songs
by
no
means
sacred
the
old
people
shook
their
heads
over
her
the
younger
ones
watched
her
with
sidelong
glances
and
when
she
left
she
kissed
peer
and
turned
round
more
than
once
to
look
back
at
him
flushed
under
her
big
hat
and
smiling
and
it
seemed
to
peer
that
she
must
surely
be
the
loveliest
creature
in
all
the
world
but
now
now
she
had
gone
to
a
place
where
the
ungodly
dwell
in
such
frightful
torment
and
no
hope
of
salvation
for
her
through
all
eternity
and
peer
all
the
while
could
only
think
of
her
in
a
light
dress
and
a
big
straw
hat
all
song
and
happy
laughter
then
came
the
question
who
was
to
pay
for
the
boy
now
true
his
baptismal
certificate
said
that
he
had
a
father
his
name
was
holm
and
he
lived
in
christiania
but
from
what
the
mother
had
said
it
was
understood
that
he
had
disappeared
long
ago
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
boy
never
till
now
had
peer
rightly
understood
that
he
was
a
stranger
here
for
all
that
he
called
the
old
couple
father
and
mother
he
lay
awake
night
after
night
up
in
the
loft
listening
to
the
talk
about
him
going
on
in
the
room
below
the
crying
and
saying
no
no
the
others
saying
how
hard
the
times
were
and
that
peer
was
quite
old
enough
now
to
be
put
to
service
as
a
on
some
farm
then
peer
would
draw
the
up
over
his
head
but
often
when
one
of
the
elders
chanced
to
be
awake
at
night
he
could
hear
some
one
in
the
loft
sobbing
in
his
sleep
in
the
daytime
he
took
up
as
little
room
as
he
could
at
the
table
and
ate
as
little
as
humanly
possible
but
every
morning
he
woke
up
in
fear
that
he
would
have
to
bid
the
old
farewell
and
go
out
among
strangers
then
something
new
and
unheard
of
plumped
down
into
the
little
cottage
by
the
fjord
there
came
a
registered
letter
with
great
dabs
of
all
over
it
and
a
handwriting
so
gentlemanly
as
to
be
almost
unreadable
every
one
crowded
round
the
eldest
son
to
see
it
opened
and
out
fell
five
notes
mercy
on
us
they
cried
in
amazement
and
can
it
be
for
us
the
next
thing
was
to
puzzle
out
what
was
written
in
the
letter
and
who
should
that
turn
out
to
be
from
but
no
other
than
peer
s
father
though
he
did
not
say
it
in
so
many
words
be
good
to
the
boy
the
letter
said
you
will
receive
fifty
crowns
from
me
every
see
that
he
gets
plenty
to
eat
and
goes
dry
and
well
shod
faithfully
your
holm
why
peer
he
s
he
s
your
father
s
a
captain
an
officer
stammered
the
eldest
girl
and
fell
back
a
step
to
stare
at
the
boy
and
we
re
to
get
twice
as
much
for
him
as
before
said
the
son
holding
the
notes
fast
and
gazing
up
at
the
ceiling
as
if
he
were
informing
heaven
of
the
fact
but
the
old
wife
was
thinking
of
something
else
as
she
folded
her
hands
in
thankfulness
now
she
needn
t
lose
the
boy
properly
fed
no
need
to
fear
for
that
peer
had
treacle
with
his
porridge
that
very
day
though
it
was
only
a
and
the
eldest
son
gave
him
a
pair
of
stockings
and
made
him
sit
down
and
put
them
on
then
and
there
and
the
same
night
when
he
went
to
bed
the
eldest
girl
came
and
tucked
him
up
in
a
new
not
quite
so
hairless
as
the
old
one
his
father
a
captain
it
seemed
too
wonderful
to
be
true
from
that
day
times
were
changed
for
peer
people
looked
at
him
with
very
different
eyes
no
one
said
poor
boy
of
him
now
the
other
boys
left
off
calling
him
bad
names
the
said
he
had
a
future
before
him
you
ll
see
they
would
say
that
father
of
yours
will
get
you
on
you
ll
be
a
parson
yet
ay
maybe
a
bishop
at
christmas
there
came
a
note
all
for
himself
to
do
just
as
he
liked
with
peer
changed
it
into
silver
so
that
his
purse
was
near
bursting
with
prosperity
no
wonder
he
began
to
go
about
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
play
the
little
prince
and
chieftain
among
the
boys
even
klaus
brock
the
doctor
s
son
made
up
to
him
and
taught
him
to
play
cards
but
you
surely
don
t
mean
to
go
and
be
a
parson
he
would
say
for
all
this
no
one
could
say
that
peer
was
too
proud
to
help
with
the
fishing
or
make
himself
useful
in
the
smithy
but
when
the
sparks
flew
showering
from
the
glowing
iron
he
could
not
help
seeing
visions
of
his
own
visions
that
flew
out
into
the
future
aye
he
would
be
a
priest
he
might
be
a
sinner
now
and
a
wild
young
scamp
he
certainly
did
curse
and
swear
like
a
trooper
at
times
if
only
to
show
the
other
boys
that
it
was
all
nonsense
about
the
earth
opening
and
swallowing
you
up
but
a
priest
he
would
be
all
the
same
none
of
your
parsons
with
spectacles
and
a
pot
belly
no
but
a
sort
of
heavenly
messenger
with
snowy
white
robes
and
a
face
of
glory
perhaps
some
day
he
might
even
come
so
far
that
he
could
go
down
into
that
place
of
torment
where
his
mother
lay
and
bring
her
up
again
up
to
salvation
and
when
in
autumn
evenings
he
stood
outside
his
palace
a
bishop
he
would
lift
up
his
finger
and
all
the
stars
should
break
into
song
clang
clang
sang
the
anvil
under
the
hammer
s
beat
in
the
still
summer
evenings
a
troop
of
boys
go
climbing
up
the
naked
slopes
towards
the
high
wooded
ranges
to
fetch
home
the
cows
for
the
milking
the
higher
they
climb
the
farther
and
farther
their
sight
can
travel
out
over
the
sea
and
an
hour
or
two
later
as
the
sun
goes
down
here
comes
a
long
string
of
cattle
trailing
down
with
a
faint
jangle
of
bells
over
the
ridges
the
boys
halloo
them
on
and
swing
their
ringed
rowan
staves
and
spit
red
juice
of
the
alder
bark
that
they
are
chewing
as
men
chew
tobacco
far
below
them
they
see
the
farm
lands
grey
in
shadow
and
beyond
the
waters
of
the
fjord
yellow
in
the
evening
light
a
mirror
where
red
clouds
and
white
sails
and
hills
of
liquid
blue
are
shining
and
away
out
on
the
farthest
headland
the
lonely
star
of
the
coast
light
over
the
grey
sea
on
such
an
evening
peer
came
down
from
the
hills
just
in
time
to
see
a
gentleman
in
a
carriole
turn
off
from
the
highway
and
take
the
down
towards
troen
the
horse
balked
suddenly
at
a
small
bridge
and
when
the
driver
reined
him
in
and
gave
him
a
cut
with
his
whip
the
beast
reared
swung
about
and
sent
the
cart
fairly
dancing
round
on
its
high
wheels
oh
well
then
i
ll
have
to
walk
cried
the
gentleman
angrily
and
flinging
the
reins
to
the
lad
behind
him
he
jumped
down
just
at
this
moment
peer
came
up
here
boy
began
the
traveller
just
take
this
bag
will
you
and
he
broke
off
suddenly
took
a
step
backward
and
looked
hard
at
the
boy
what
surely
it
can
t
be
is
it
you
peer
said
peer
gaping
a
little
and
took
off
his
cap
well
now
that
s
funny
my
name
is
holm
well
well
well
well
the
lad
in
the
cart
had
driven
off
and
the
gentleman
from
the
city
and
the
pale
country
boy
with
the
patched
trousers
stood
looking
at
each
other
the
newcomer
was
a
man
of
fifty
or
so
but
still
straight
and
active
though
his
hair
and
beard
were
sprinkled
with
grey
his
eyes
twinkled
gaily
under
the
brim
of
his
black
felt
hat
his
long
overcoat
was
open
showing
a
gold
chain
across
his
waistcoat
with
a
pair
of
gloves
and
an
umbrella
in
one
hand
a
light
travelling
bag
in
the
other
and
his
beautifully
polished
shoes
a
grand
gentleman
thought
peer
if
ever
there
was
one
and
this
was
his
father
so
that
s
how
you
look
my
boy
not
very
big
for
your
age
nearly
sixteen
now
aren
t
you
do
they
give
you
enough
to
eat
yes
said
peer
with
conviction
the
pair
walked
down
together
towards
the
grey
cottage
by
the
fjord
suddenly
the
man
stopped
and
looked
at
it
through
eyes
is
that
where
you
ve
been
living
all
these
years
in
that
little
hut
there
yes
that
s
the
place
troen
they
call
why
that
wall
there
bulges
so
i
should
think
the
whole
affair
would
collapse
peer
tried
to
laugh
at
this
but
felt
something
like
a
lump
in
his
throat
it
hurt
to
hear
fine
folks
talk
like
that
of
father
and
mother
s
little
house
there
was
a
great
flurry
when
the
strange
gentleman
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
old
wife
was
kneading
away
at
the
dough
for
a
cake
the
front
of
her
all
white
with
flour
the
old
man
sat
with
his
spectacles
on
patching
a
shoe
and
the
two
girls
sprang
up
from
their
spinning
wheels
well
here
i
am
my
name
s
holm
said
the
traveller
looking
round
and
smiling
mercy
on
us
the
captain
his
own
self
murmured
the
old
woman
wiping
her
hands
on
her
skirt
he
was
an
affable
gentleman
and
soon
set
them
all
at
their
ease
he
sat
down
in
the
seat
of
honour
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
talking
easily
as
if
quite
at
home
one
of
the
girls
had
been
in
service
for
a
while
in
a
consul
s
family
in
the
town
and
knew
the
ways
of
gentlefolk
and
she
fetched
a
bowl
of
milk
and
offered
it
with
a
curtsy
and
a
will
the
captain
please
to
take
some
milk
thanks
thanks
said
the
visitor
and
what
is
your
name
my
dear
come
there
s
nothing
to
blush
about
nicoline
and
you
lusiana
that
s
he
looked
at
the
basin
and
taking
it
up
all
but
emptied
it
at
a
draught
then
wiping
his
beard
took
breath
phu
that
was
good
well
so
here
i
and
he
looked
around
the
room
and
at
each
of
them
in
turn
and
smiled
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
and
said
well
well
well
well
and
seemed
much
amused
with
everything
in
general
by
the
way
nicoline
he
said
suddenly
since
you
re
so
well
up
in
titles
i
m
not
captain
any
more
now
they
ve
sent
me
up
this
way
as
and
my
wife
has
just
had
a
house
left
her
in
your
town
here
so
we
may
be
coming
to
settle
down
in
these
parts
and
perhaps
you
d
better
send
letters
to
me
through
a
friend
in
future
but
we
can
talk
about
all
that
by
and
by
well
well
well
and
all
the
time
he
was
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
smiling
peer
noticed
that
he
wore
gold
and
a
fine
gold
stud
in
his
broad
white
and
then
a
little
packet
was
produced
hi
peer
come
and
look
here
s
something
for
and
the
something
was
nothing
less
than
a
real
silver
watch
and
peer
was
quite
unhappy
for
the
moment
because
he
couldn
t
dash
off
at
once
and
show
it
to
all
the
other
boys
there
s
a
father
for
you
said
the
old
wife
clapping
her
hands
and
almost
in
tears
but
the
visitor
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
father
father
h
m
that
s
not
a
thing
any
one
can
be
so
sure
about
hahaha
and
hahaha
echoed
the
old
man
still
sitting
with
the
awl
in
his
hand
this
was
the
sort
of
joke
he
could
appreciate
then
the
visitor
went
out
and
strolled
about
the
place
with
his
hands
under
his
coat
tails
and
looked
at
the
sky
and
the
fjord
and
murmured
well
well
well
well
and
peer
followed
him
about
all
the
while
and
gazed
at
him
as
he
might
have
gazed
at
a
star
he
was
to
sleep
in
a
neighbour
s
house
where
there
was
a
room
that
had
a
bed
with
sheets
on
it
and
peer
went
across
with
him
and
carried
his
bag
it
was
martin
bruvold
s
parents
who
were
to
house
the
traveller
and
people
stood
round
staring
at
the
place
martin
himself
was
waiting
outside
this
a
friend
of
yours
peer
here
then
my
boy
here
s
something
to
buy
a
big
farm
this
time
it
was
a
note
and
martin
stood
fingering
it
hardly
able
to
believe
his
eyes
peer
s
father
was
something
like
a
father
it
was
a
fine
thing
too
to
see
a
grand
gentleman
undress
i
ll
have
things
like
that
some
day
thought
peer
watching
each
new
wonder
that
came
out
of
the
bag
there
was
a
brush
that
he
brushed
his
hair
and
beard
with
walking
up
and
down
in
his
underclothes
and
humming
to
himself
and
then
there
was
another
shirt
with
red
stripes
round
the
collar
just
to
wear
in
bed
peer
nodded
to
himself
taking
it
all
in
and
when
the
stranger
was
in
bed
he
took
out
a
flask
with
a
silver
cork
that
screwed
off
and
turned
into
a
cup
and
had
a
dram
for
a
nightcap
and
then
he
reached
for
a
long
pipe
with
a
beaded
cord
and
when
it
was
drawing
well
he
stretched
himself
out
comfortably
and
smiled
at
peer
well
now

boy

pay
for
it
so
she
made
my
money
do
for
both
hahaha
well
poor
girl
we
can
t
blame
her
for
that
anyhow
we
ll
have
to
look
after
that
little
of
yours
now
i
suppose
till
she
grows
up
don
t
you
think
so
yourself
peer
felt
the
tears
coming
think
so
indeed
he
did
next
day
peer
s
father
went
away
he
stood
there
ready
to
start
in
the
at
troen
stiff
felt
hat
and
overcoat
and
all
and
said
in
a
tone
like
the
sheriff
s
when
he
gives
out
a
public
notice
at
the
church
door
and
by
the
way
you
re
to
have
the
boy
confirmed
this
yes
to
be
sure
we
will
the
old
mother
hastened
to
say
then
i
wish
him
to
be
properly
dressed
like
the
best
of
the
other
youngsters
and
there
s
fifty
crowns
for
him
to
give
the
and
the
parson
as
a
parting
he
handed
over
some
more
notes
afterwards
he
went
on
i
mean
of
course
to
look
after
him
until
he
can
make
his
own
way
in
a
respectable
position
but
first
we
must
see
what
he
has
a
turn
for
and
what
he
d
like
to
be
himself
he
d
better
come
to
town
and
talk
it
over
with
me
but
i
ll
write
and
arrange
all
that
after
he
s
confirmed
then
in
case
anything
unexpected
should
happen
to
me
there
s
some
money
laid
by
for
him
in
a
savings
bank
account
he
can
apply
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
knows
all
about
it
well
and
very
many
thanks
and
the
great
man
smiled
to
right
and
left
and
shook
them
all
by
the
hand
and
waved
his
hat
and
was
gone
for
the
next
few
days
peer
walked
on
air
and
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
footing
at
all
on
the
common
earth
people
were
for
ever
filling
his
head
with
talk
about
that
savings
bank
account
it
might
be
only
a
few
thousands
of
crowns
but
then
again
it
might
run
up
to
a
million
a
million
and
here
he
was
eating
herrings
for
dinner
and
talking
to
tom
dick
and
harry
just
like
any
one
else
a
million
crowns
late
in
the
autumn
came
the
confirmation
and
the
old
wooden
church
with
its
tarred
walls
nestled
among
its
mighty
sent
its
chimes
ringing
and
ringing
out
into
the
blue
autumn
air
it
seemed
to
peer
like
some
kindly
old
grandmother
calling
so
lovingly
come
come
old
and
young
old
and
young
from
fjord
and
valley
northways
and
southways
come
come
this
day
of
all
days
this
day
of
all
days
come
come
come
so
it
had
stood
ringing
out
the
chimes
for
one
generation
after
another
through
hundreds
of
years
and
now
it
is
calling
to
us
and
the
young
folks
are
there
looking
at
one
another
in
their
new
clothes
and
blowing
their
noses
on
clean
white
handkerchiefs
so
carefully
folded
there
comes
peter
ronningen
passed
by
good
luck
this
year
but
forced
to
turn
out
in
a
jacket
borrowed
from
peer
as
the
tailor
wasn
t
ready
with
his
own
new
things
the
boys
say
and
try
to
smile
like
folks
one
or
two
of
them
may
have
some
little
account
dating
from
old
waiting
to
be
settled
but
never
mind
just
as
well
to
forget
old
scores
now
peer
caught
sight
of
johan
koja
who
stole
a
pencil
from
him
last
summer
but
after
all
even
that
didn
t
seem
worth
making
a
fuss
about
well
how
ve
you
been
getting
on
since
last
summer
they
ask
each
other
as
they
move
together
up
the
stone
steps
to
the
big
church
door
through
which
the
peal
of
the
organ
comes
rolling
out
to
meet
them
how
good
it
seems
and
how
kind
the
little
church
where
all
you
see
bids
you
welcome
through
the
windows
with
their
tiny
leaded
panes
falls
a
light
so
soft
that
even
poor
ugly
faces
seem
beautiful
the
organ
tones
are
the
very
light
itself
turned
into
sweet
sound
on
one
side
of
the
nave
you
can
see
all
the
boys
heads
sleek
with
water
on
the
other
the
little
mothers
to
be
in
dress
for
the
first
time
kerchief
on
head
and
in
hand
and
with
careful
faces
and
now
they
all
sing
the
elder
folks
have
taken
their
places
farther
back
but
they
join
in
looking
up
now
and
again
from
the
book
to
those
young
heads
in
front
and
wondering
how
they
will
fare
in
life
and
the
young
folk
themselves
are
thinking
as
they
sing
is
the
beginning
of
new
things
play
and
frolic
are
over
and
done
with
from
today
we
re
but
the
church
and
all
in
it
seemed
to
say
if
ever
you
are
in
heavy
trouble
come
hither
to
just
look
at
that
there
the
are
a
whole
bible
in
themselves
but
moses
with
the
tables
of
the
law
is
gentle
of
face
you
can
see
he
means
no
harm
after
all
peter
with
the
keys
pointing
upwards
looks
like
a
kind
old
uncle
bringing
something
good
home
from
market
and
then
the
angels
on
the
walls
pictured
or
carved
in
wood
have
borrowed
the
voice
of
the
organ
and
the
tones
of
the
hymn
and
they
widen
out
the
vaulted
roof
into
the
dome
of
heaven
while
light
and
song
and
worshippers
melt
together
and
soar
upwards
toward
the
infinite
spaces
peer
was
thinking
all
the
time
i
don
t
care
if
i
m
rich
as
rich
i
will
be
a
priest
and
then
perhaps
with
all
my
money
i
can
build
a
church
that
no
one
ever
saw
the
like
of
and
the
first
couple
i
ll
marry
there
shall
be
martin
bruvold
and
little
sister
louise
if
only
he
ll
have
her
just
wait
and
see
a
few
days
later
he
wrote
to
his
father
asking
if
he
might
come
into
town
now
and
go
to
school
a
long
time
passed
and
then
at
last
a
letter
came
in
a
strange
and
all
the
grown
folks
at
troen
came
together
again
to
read
it
but
what
was
their
amazement
when
they
read
you
will
possibly
have
learned
by
now
from
the
newspapers
that
your
benefactor
colonel
holm
has
met
his
death
by
a
fall
from
a
horse
i
must
therefore
request
you
to
call
on
me
personally
at
your
earliest
convenience
as
i
have
several
matters
to
settle
with
you
yours
faithfully
grundt
senior
they
stood
and
looked
at
one
another
peer
was
crying
chiefly
it
must
be
admitted
at
the
thought
of
having
to
bid
to
all
the
troen
folks
and
the
two
cows
and
the
calf
and
the
grey
cat
he
might
have
to
go
right
on
to
christiania
no
later
than
to
go
to
school
there
and
when
he
came
back
why
very
likely
the
old
mother
might
not
be
there
any
more
so
all
three
of
them
were
when
the
and
the
old
man
came
down
with
him
to
the
pier
and
soon
he
was
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
fjord
steamer
gazing
at
the
two
figures
growing
smaller
and
smaller
on
the
shore
and
then
one
hut
after
another
in
the
little
hamlet
disappeared
behind
the
ness
troen
itself
was
gone
now
and
the
hills
and
the
woods
where
he
had
cut
ring
staves
and
searched
for
stray
cattle
swiftly
all
known
things
drew
away
and
vanished
until
at
last
the
whole
parish
was
gone
and
his
childhood
over
chapter
iii
as
evening
fell
he
saw
a
multitude
of
lights
spread
out
on
every
side
far
ahead
in
the
darkness
and
next
with
his
little
wooden
chest
on
his
shoulder
he
was
finding
his
way
up
through
the
streets
by
the
quay
to
a
for
country
folk
which
he
knew
from
former
visits
when
he
had
come
to
the
town
with
the
lofoten
boats
next
morning
clad
in
his
country
homespun
he
marched
up
along
river
street
over
the
bridge
and
up
the
hill
to
the
villa
quarter
where
he
had
to
ask
the
way
at
last
he
arrived
outside
a
wooden
house
standing
back
in
a
garden
here
was
the
place
the
place
where
his
fate
was
to
be
decided
after
the
country
fashion
he
walked
in
at
the
kitchen
door
a
stout
servant
maid
in
a
big
white
apron
was
rattling
the
rings
of
the
kitchen
range
into
place
there
was
a
pleasing
smell
of
coffee
and
good
things
to
eat
suddenly
a
door
opened
and
a
figure
in
a
appeared
a
tall
man
with
gold
spectacles
astride
on
a
long
red
nose
his
thick
hair
and
scrubby
little
moustaches
touched
with
grey
he
gasped
once
or
twice
and
then
started
sneezing
wiped
his
nose
with
a
large
and
grumbled
out
ugh
this
wretched
cold
can
t
get
rid
of
it
how
about
my
socks
bertha
my
good
girl
do
you
think
they
are
quite
dry
now
i
ve
had
them
hung
up
ever
since
i
lit
the
fire
this
morning
said
the
girl
tossing
her
head
but
who
is
this
young
gentleman
may
i
ask
the
gold
spectacles
were
turned
full
on
peer
who
rose
and
bowed
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
you
sir
put
in
the
maid
ah
from
the
country
i
see
have
you
anything
to
sell
my
lad
no
said
peer
he
had
had
a
letter
the
red
head
seemed
positively
frightened
at
this
and
the
faltered
backwards
as
if
to
find
support
he
cast
a
hurried
glance
at
the
girl
and
then
beckoned
with
a
long
to
peer
yes
yes
perfectly
so
be
so
good
as
to
come
this
way
my
peer
found
himself
in
a
room
with
rows
of
books
all
round
the
walls
and
a
big
in
the
centre
sit
down
my
the
schoolmaster
went
and
picked
out
a
long
pipe
and
filled
it
clearing
his
throat
nervously
with
an
occasional
glance
at
the
boy
h
m
so
this
is
you
this
is
peer
h
he
lit
his
pipe
and
puffed
a
little
found
himself
again
obliged
to
sneeze
but
at
last
settled
down
in
a
chair
at
the
stretched
out
his
long
legs
and
puffed
away
again
so
that
s
what
you
look
like
with
a
quick
movement
he
reached
for
a
photograph
in
a
frame
peer
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
father
in
uniform
the
schoolmaster
lifted
his
spectacles
stared
at
the
picture
then
let
down
his
spectacles
again
and
fell
to
scrutinising
peer
s
face
there
was
a
silence
for
a
while
and
then
he
said
ah
indeed
i
see
h
then
turning
to
peer
well
my
lad
it
was
very
sudden
your
benefactor
s
end
most
unexpected
he
is
to
be
buried
benefactor
thought
peer
why
doesn
t
he
say
your
father
the
schoolmaster
was
gazing
at
the
window
he
informed
me
some
time
ago
of
h
m
of
all
the
all
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
you
h
m
and
he
begged
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
myself
in
case
anything
happened
to
him
and
now
the
spectacles
swung
round
towards
peer
now
you
are
starting
out
in
life
by
yourself
hey
yes
said
peer
shifting
a
little
in
his
seat
you
will
have
to
decide
now
what
walk
in
life
you
are
to
er
devote
yourself
yes
said
peer
again
sitting
up
straighter
you
would
perhaps
like
to
be
a
fisherman
like
the
good
people
you
ve
been
brought
up
among
peer
shook
his
head
disdainfully
was
this
man
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
him
some
trade
then
perhaps
no
oh
then
i
suppose
it
s
to
be
america
well
you
will
easily
find
company
to
go
with
such
numbers
are
going
nowadays
i
am
sorry
to
say
peer
pulled
himself
together
oh
no
not
that
at
better
get
it
out
at
once
i
wish
to
be
a
priest
he
said
speaking
with
a
careful
town
accent
the
schoolmaster
rose
from
his
seat
holding
his
long
pipe
up
in
the
air
in
one
hand
and
pressing
his
ear
forward
with
the
other
as
though
to
hear
better
what
what
did
you
say
a
priest
repeated
peer
but
he
moved
behind
his
chair
as
he
spoke
for
it
looked
as
if
the
schoolmaster
might
fling
the
pipe
at
his
head
but
suddenly
the
red
face
broke
into
a
smile
exposing
such
an
array
of
greenish
teeth
as
peer
had
never
seen
before
then
he
said
in
a
sort
of
singsong
nodding
a
priest
oh
indeed
quite
a
small
matter
he
rose
and
wandered
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
room
then
stopped
nodded
and
said
in
a
fatherly
tone
to
one
of
the
bookshelves
h
m
really
really
we
re
a
little
ambitious
are
we
not
he
turned
on
peer
suddenly
look
here
my
young
friend
don
t
you
think
your
benefactor
has
been
quite
generous
enough
to
you
already
yes
indeed
he
has
said
peer
his
voice
beginning
to
tremble
a
little
there
are
thousands
of
boys
in
your
position
who
are
thrown
out
in
the
world
after
confirmation
and
left
to
shift
for
themselves
without
a
soul
to
lend
them
a
helping
yes
gasped
peer
looking
round
involuntarily
towards
the
door
i
can
t
understand
who
can
have
put
these
wild
ideas
into
your
head
with
an
effort
peer
managed
to
get
out
it
s
always
been
what
i
wanted
and
he
father
who
father
do
you
mean
your
benefactor
well
he
was
my
father
wasn
t
he
burst
out
peer
the
schoolmaster
tottered
back
and
sank
into
a
chair
staring
at
peer
as
if
he
thought
him
a
quite
hopeless
subject
at
last
he
recovered
so
far
as
to
say
look
here
my
lad
don
t
you
think
you
might
be
content
to
call
him
now
and
for
the
future
just
your
benefactor
don
t
you
think
he
deserves
it
oh
yes
whispered
peer
almost
in
tears
you
are
thinking
of
course
you
and
those
who
have
put
all
this
nonsense
into
your
head
of
the
money
which
he
h
m
yes
isn
t
there
a
savings
bank
account
aha
there
we
are
yes
indeed
there
is
a
savings
bank
account
in
my
he
rose
and
hunted
out
from
a
drawer
a
small
book
peer
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
here
it
is
the
sum
entered
here
to
your
account
amounts
to
eighteen
hundred
crash
peer
felt
as
if
he
had
fallen
through
the
floor
into
the
cellarage
all
his
dreams
vanished
into
thin
air
the
million
crowns
priest
and
bishop
christiania
and
all
the
rest
on
the
day
when
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
set
up
independently
as
an
artisan
a
farmer
or
a
fisherman
and
when
you
seem
to
me
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
to
deserve
such
help
then
and
not
till
then
i
place
this
book
at
your
disposal
do
you
understand
what
i
say
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
i
am
in
full
agreement
with
the
wishes
of
the
donor
in
deciding
that
the
money
must
remain
untouched
in
my
safe
keeping
until
yes
whispered
peer
what
are
you
crying
no
pray
don
t
go
yet
sit
down
there
are
one
or
two
things
we
must
get
settled
at
once
first
of
all
you
must
trust
me
my
good
boy
do
you
believe
that
i
wish
you
well
or
do
you
not
yes
then
it
is
agreed
that
all
these
fancies
about
going
to
college
and
so
forth
must
be
driven
out
of
your
head
once
for
all
you
can
see
yourself
that
even
supposing
you
had
the
mental
qualifications
such
a
sum
generous
as
it
is
in
itself
would
not
suffice
to
carry
you
on
the
other
hand
if
you
wish
it
i
will
gladly
arrange
to
get
you
an
apprentice
s
place
with
a
good
handicraftsman
here
you
would
have
free
board
there
and
well
if
you
should
want
clothes
the
first
year
or
so
i
dare
say
we
could
manage
that
you
will
be
better
without
to
fling
about
until
you
can
earn
it
for
peer
sighed
and
drooped
as
he
stood
when
he
saw
the
book
locked
into
its
drawer
again
and
heard
the
keys
rattle
as
they
went
back
into
a
pocket
under
the
he
felt
as
if
some
one
were
pointing
a
jeering
finger
at
him
and
saying
yah
then
there
s
another
thing
about
your
name
what
name
have
you
thought
of
taking
my
lad
surname
i
mean
my
name
is
peer
holm
said
the
boy
instinctively
drawing
himself
up
as
he
had
done
when
the
bishop
had
patted
his
head
at
the
confirmation
and
asked
his
name
the
schoolmaster
pursed
up
his
lips
took
off
his
spectacles
and
wiped
them
put
them
on
again
and
turned
to
the
bookshelves
with
a
sigh
ah
indeed
yes
yes
i
almost
thought
as
then
he
came
forward
and
laid
a
hand
kindly
on
peer
s
shoulder
my
dear
boy
that
is
out
of
the
a
shiver
went
through
peer
had
he
done
something
wrong
again
see
here
my
boy
have
you
considered
that
there
may
be
others
of
that
name
in
this
same
place
yes
but
wait
a
minute
and
that
you
would
occasion
these
others
the
deepest
pain
and
distress
if
it
should
become
known
that
well
how
matters
stand
you
see
i
am
treating
you
as
a
man
a
gentleman
and
i
feel
sure
you
would
not
wish
to
inflict
a
great
sorrow
a
crushing
blow
upon
a
widow
and
her
innocent
children
there
there
my
boy
there
s
nothing
to
cry
about
life
my
young
friend
life
has
troubles
that
must
be
faced
what
is
the
name
of
the
farm
or
house
where
you
have
lived
up
to
now
t
troen
a
very
good
name
indeed
then
from
on
you
will
call
yourself
peer
and
if
any
one
should
ask
about
your
father
remember
that
you
are
bound
in
honour
and
conscience
not
to
mention
your
benefactor
s
well
then
as
soon
as
you
have
made
up
your
mind
come
at
once
and
let
me
know
we
shall
be
great
friends
yet
you
will
see
you
re
sure
you
wouldn
t
like
to
try
america
well
well
come
along
out
to
the
kitchen
and
see
if
we
can
find
you
some
peer
found
himself
a
moment
after
sitting
on
a
chair
in
the
kitchen
where
there
was
such
a
good
smell
of
coffee
bertha
said
the
schoolmaster
coaxingly
you
ll
find
something
good
for
breakfast
for
my
young
friend
here
won
t
you
he
waved
a
farewell
with
his
hand
took
down
his
socks
from
a
string
above
the
stove
and
disappeared
through
the
door
again
chapter
iv
when
a
country
boy
in
blue
homespun
with
a
peaked
cap
on
his
blond
head
goes
wandering
at
random
through
the
streets
of
a
town
it
is
no
particular
concern
of
any
one
else
he
moves
along
gazing
in
at
shop
windows
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
whistling
looking
at
everything
around
him
or
at
nothing
at
all
and
yet
perhaps
in
the
head
under
that
peaked
cap
it
seems
as
if
a
whole
little
world
had
suddenly
collapsed
and
he
may
be
whistling
hard
to
keep
from
crying
in
the
streets
for
people
to
see
he
steps
aside
to
avoid
a
cart
and
runs
into
a
man
who
drops
his
cigar
in
the
gutter
confounded
country
lout
says
the
man
angrily
but
passes
on
and
has
forgotten
boy
and
all
the
next
moment
but
a
little
farther
on
a
big
dog
comes
dashing
out
of
a
yard
and
unluckily
upsets
a
fat
old
woman
on
the
pavement
and
the
boy
with
the
peaked
cap
for
all
his
troubles
can
not
help
doubling
up
and
roaring
with
laughter
that
afternoon
peer
sat
on
one
of
the
ramparts
below
the
fortress
biting
at
a
stalk
of
grass
and
twirling
the
end
in
his
fingers
below
him
lay
town
and
fjord
in
the
mild
october
sunlight
the
rumble
of
traffic
the
noises
from
workshops
and
harbour
came
up
to
him
through
the
luminous
haze
there
he
sat
while
the
sentry
on
the
wall
above
marched
back
and
forth
with
his
rifle
on
his
shoulder
left
right
left
you
may
climb
very
high
up
indeed
and
fall
down
very
deep
and
no
such
terrible
harm
done
after
all
as
long
as
you
don
t
absolutely
break
your
neck
and
gradually
peer
began
to
realise
that
he
was
still
alive
after
all
it
is
a
bad
business
when
the
world
goes
against
you
even
though
you
may
have
some
one
to
turn
to
for
advice
and
sympathy
but
when
all
the
people
round
you
are
utter
strangers
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
sit
down
and
twirl
a
straw
and
think
things
out
a
bit
for
yourself
peer
s
thoughts
were
of
a
thing
in
a
long
that
had
taken
his
bank
book
and
locked
it
up
and
rattled
the
keys
at
him
and
said
yah
and
deposed
him
from
his
bishopric
and
tried
to
sneeze
and
squeeze
him
into
a
trade
where
he
d
have
to
carry
a
all
his
life
and
be
peer
troen
tailor
but
he
wouldn
t
have
that
he
sat
there
bracing
himself
up
and
trying
to
gather
together
from
somewhere
a
thing
he
had
never
had
much
need
of
before
to
wit
a
will
of
his
own
something
to
set
up
against
the
whole
wide
world
what
was
he
to
do
now
he
felt
he
would
like
to
go
back
to
troen
first
of
all
and
talk
things
over
with
the
old
father
and
mother
they
would
be
sorry
for
him
there
and
say
poor
boy
and
pray
for
him
but
after
a
day
or
two
he
knew
they
would
begin
to
glance
at
him
at
meals
and
remember
that
there
was
no
one
to
pay
for
him
now
and
that
times
were
hard
no
that
was
no
refuge
for
him
now
but
what
could
he
do
then
clearly
it
was
not
such
a
simple
matter
to
be
all
alone
in
the
world
a
little
later
he
found
himself
on
a
hillside
by
the
cathedral
churchyard
sitting
under
the
yellowing
trees
and
wondering
dreamily
where
his
father
was
to
be
buried
what
a
difference
between
him
and
that
schoolmaster
man
no
preaching
with
him
no
whining
about
what
his
boy
might
call
himself
or
might
not
why
must
he
go
and
die
it
was
strange
to
think
of
that
fine
strong
man
who
had
brushed
his
hair
and
beard
so
carefully
with
his
brush
to
think
that
he
was
lying
still
in
a
coffin
now
and
would
soon
be
covered
up
with
earth
people
were
coming
up
the
hill
now
and
passing
in
to
the
churchyard
the
men
wore
black
clothes
and
tall
shiny
hats
but
there
were
some
officers
too
with
plumes
and
sashes
and
then
a
regimental
band
with
its
brass
instruments
peer
slipped
into
the
churchyard
with
the
crowd
but
kept
apart
from
the
rest
and
took
up
his
stand
a
little
way
off
beside
a
big
monument
it
must
be
father
s
funeral
he
thought
to
himself
and
was
broad
awake
at
once
this
he
guessed
must
be
the
cadet
school
that
came
marching
in
and
formed
up
in
two
lines
from
the
mortuary
chapel
to
the
open
grave
the
place
was
nearly
full
of
people
now
there
were
women
holding
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
and
an
elderly
lady
in
black
went
into
the
chapel
on
the
arm
of
a
tall
man
in
uniform
that
must
be
father
s
wife
thought
peer
and
the
young
ladies
there
in
black
are
my
and
that
young
lieutenant
my
how
strange
it
all
was
a
sound
of
singing
came
from
the
chapel
and
a
little
later
six
sergeants
came
out
carrying
a
coffin
all
heaped
with
flowers
present
arms
and
the
soldiers
presented
and
the
band
played
a
slow
march
and
moved
off
in
front
of
the
coffin
between
the
two
lines
of
soldiers
and
then
came
a
great
following
of
mourners
the
lady
in
black
came
out
again
sobbing
behind
her
handkerchief
and
hardly
able
to
follow
though
she
clung
to
the
tall
officer
s
arm
but
in
front
of
the
pair
just
behind
the
coffin
itself
walked
a
tall
man
in
splendid
uniform
with
gold
epaulettes
plumed
hat
and
sword
bearing
a
cushion
with
two
jewelled
stars
and
the
long
long
train
of
mourners
moved
slowly
gently
on
and
there
there
by
the
grave
stood
the
priest
holding
a
spade
peer
was
anxious
to
hear
what
the
priest
would
have
to
say
about
his
father
involuntarily
he
stole
a
little
nearer
though
he
felt
somehow
that
it
would
not
do
to
come
too
close
a
hymn
was
sung
at
the
graveside
the
band
accompanying
peer
took
off
his
cap
he
was
too
taken
up
to
notice
that
one
of
the
mourners
was
watching
him
intently
and
presently
left
the
group
and
came
towards
him
the
man
wore
spectacles
and
a
shiny
tall
hat
and
it
was
not
until
he
began
to
sneeze
that
peer
recognised
him
it
was
the
schoolmaster
glaring
at
him
now
with
a
face
so
full
of
horror
and
fury
that
the
spectacles
almost
seemed
to
be
spitting
fire
you
you
are
you
mad
he
whispered
in
peer
s
face
clenching
his
black
gloved
hands
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
want
to
cause
a
catastrophe
of
all
days
go
get
away
at
once
do
you
hear
me
go
for
heaven
s
sake
get
away
from
here
before
any
one
peer
turned
and
fled
hearing
behind
him
as
he
went
a
threatening
if
ever
you
dare
again
while
the
voices
and
the
band
swelling
higher
in
the
hymn
seemed
to
strike
him
in
the
back
and
drive
him
on
he
was
far
down
in
the
town
before
he
could
stop
and
pull
himself
together
one
thing
was
clear
after
this
he
could
never
face
that
schoolmaster
again
all
was
lost
could
he
even
be
sure
that
what
he
had
done
wasn
t
so
frightfully
wrong
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
prison
for
it
next
day
the
troen
folk
were
sitting
at
their
dinner
when
the
eldest
son
looked
out
of
the
window
and
said
there
s
peer
mercy
on
us
cried
the
as
he
came
in
what
is
the
matter
peer
are
you
ill
ah
it
was
good
that
night
to
creep
in
under
the
old
familiar
once
more
and
the
old
mother
sat
on
the
bedside
and
talked
to
him
of
the
lord
by
way
of
comfort
peer
clenched
his
hands
under
the
clothes
somehow
he
thought
now
of
the
lord
as
a
sort
of
schoolmaster
in
a
yet
it
was
some
comfort
all
the
same
to
have
the
old
soul
sit
there
and
talk
to
him
peer
had
much
to
put
up
with
in
the
days
that
followed
much
tittering
and
whispers
of
look
there
goes
the
priest
as
he
went
by
at
table
he
felt
ashamed
of
every
mouthful
he
took
he
hunted
for
jobs
as
on
distant
farms
so
as
to
earn
a
little
to
help
pay
for
his
keep
and
when
the
winter
came
he
would
have
to
do
as
the
others
did
hire
himself
out
young
and
small
as
he
was
for
the
lofoten
fishing
but
one
day
after
church
klaus
brock
drew
him
aside
and
got
him
to
talk
things
over
at
length
first
klaus
told
him
that
he
himself
was
going
away
he
was
to
begin
in
one
of
the
mechanical
workshops
in
town
and
go
from
there
to
the
technical
college
to
qualify
for
an
engineer
and
next
he
wanted
to
hear
the
whole
truth
about
what
had
happened
to
peer
that
day
in
town
for
when
people
went
slapping
their
thighs
and
sniggering
about
the
young
priest
that
had
turned
out
a
beggar
klaus
felt
he
would
like
to
give
the
lot
of
them
a
darned
good
hammering
so
the
two
boys
wandered
up
and
down
talking
and
in
the
days
to
come
peer
never
forgot
how
his
old
accomplice
in
the
had
stood
by
him
now
do
like
me
urged
klaus
you
re
a
bit
of
a
smith
already
man
go
to
the
workshops
and
read
up
in
your
spare
time
for
the
entrance
exam
to
the
technical
then
three
years
at
the
college
the
eighteen
hundred
crowns
will
cover
that
and
there
you
are
an
engineer
and
needn
t
even
owe
any
one
a
peer
shook
his
head
he
was
sure
he
would
never
dare
to
show
his
face
before
that
schoolmaster
again
much
less
ask
for
the
money
in
the
bank
no
the
whole
thing
was
over
and
done
with
for
him
but
devil
take
it
man
surely
you
can
see
that
this
ape
of
a
schoolmaster
dare
not
keep
you
out
of
your
money
let
me
come
with
you
we
ll
go
up
and
tackle
him
together
and
then
then
you
ll
and
klaus
clenched
his
fists
and
thrust
out
one
shoulder
fiercely
but
when
january
came
there
was
peer
in
in
the
foc
s
le
of
a
lofoten
ploughing
the
long
north
to
the
in
frost
and
all
through
that
winter
he
lived
the
fisherman
s
life
on
land
in
one
of
the
tiny
where
a
crew
is
packed
like
sardines
in
an
air
so
thick
you
can
cut
it
with
a
knife
at
sea
where
in
a
fair
wind
you
stand
half
the
day
doing
nothing
and
freezing
stiff
the
while
and
a
foul
wind
means
out
oars
and
row
row
row
over
an
endless
plain
of
rolling
icy
combers
row
row
till
one
s
hands
are
lumps
of
bleeding
flesh
peer
lived
through
it
all
thinking
now
and
then
when
he
could
think
at
all
how
the
grand
gentlefolk
had
driven
him
out
to
this
life
because
he
was
impertinent
enough
to
exist
and
when
the
fourteen
weeks
were
past
and
the
lofoten
boats
stood
into
the
fjord
again
on
a
mild
spring
day
it
was
easy
for
peer
to
reckon
out
his
earnings
which
were
just
nothing
at
all
he
had
had
to
borrow
money
for
his
outfit
and
food
and
he
would
be
lucky
if
his
boy
s
share
was
enough
to
cover
what
he
owed
a
few
weeks
later
a
boy
stood
by
the
yard
gate
of
an
engineering
works
in
the
town
just
as
the
bell
was
ringing
and
the
men
came
streaming
out
and
asked
for
klaus
brock
hullo
peer
that
you
been
to
lofoten
and
made
your
fortune
the
two
boys
stood
a
moment
taking
stock
of
one
another
klaus
and
in
peer
and
tanned
by
storm
and
spray
the
manager
of
the
factory
was
klaus
s
uncle
and
the
same
afternoon
his
nephew
came
into
the
office
with
a
new
hand
wanting
to
be
taken
on
as
apprentice
he
had
done
some
smithy
work
before
he
said
and
he
was
taken
on
forthwith

of

very
well
that

the
two
boys
went
out
with
a
feeling
of
having
done
something
rather
daring
and
anyway
if
trouble
should
come
along
there
would
be
two
of
them
now
to
tackle
it

beery
nose
was
turned
towards
him
and
the
man
dragged
himself
up
and
wiped
his
hands
on
his
trousers
right
you
are
said
he
and
led
the
way
across
the
yard
up
some
stairs
and
into
a
little
room
with
two
panes
of
glass
looking
on
to
the
street
and
a
on
the
yard
the
room
had
a
bed
with
sheets
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
table
in
front
of
the
six
and
six
a
month
agreed
peer
took
it
on
the
spot
paid
down
the
first
month
s
rent
and
having
got
rid
of
the
man
sat
down
on
his
chest
and
looked
about
him
many
people
have
never
a
roof
to
their
heads
but
here
was
he
peer
with
a
home
of
his
own
outside
in
the
yard
the
woman
had
begun
yelping
her
abuse
again
the
horses
in
the
stable
beneath
were
stamping
and
whinnying
but
peer
had
lodged
in
and
peasants
quarters
and
was
not
too
particular
here
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
a
place
of
his
own
and
within
its
walls
was
master
of
the
house
and
his
own
master
food
was
the
next
thing
he
went
out
and
bought
in
supplies
stocking
his
chest
with
plain
country
fare
at
dinner
time
he
sat
on
the
lid
as
fishermen
do
and
made
a
good
solid
meal
of
flat
bannocks
and
cold
bacon
and
now
he
at
his
new
work
there
was
no
question
of
whether
it
was
what
he
wanted
or
not
here
was
a
chance
of
getting
up
in
the
world
and
that
without
having
to
beg
any
one
s
leave
he
meant
to
get
on
and
it
was
not
long
before
his
dreams
began
to
take
a
new
shape
from
his
new
life
he
stood
at
the
bottom
of
a
ladder
a
blacksmith
s
boy
but
up
at
the
top
sat
a
mighty
chief
engineer
with
gold
spectacles
and
white
waistcoat
that
was
where
he
would
be
one
day
and
if
any
schoolmaster
came
along
and
tried
to
keep
him
back
this
time
well
just
let
him
try
it
they
had
turned
him
out
of
a
churchyard
once
he
would
have
his
revenge
for
that
some
day
it
might
take
him
years
and
years
to
do
it
but
one
fine
day
he
would
be
as
good
as
the
best
of
them
and
would
pay
them
back
in
full
in
the
misty
mornings
as
he
tramped
in
to
his
work
in
hand
his
footsteps
on
the
plank
bridge
seemed
hammering
out
with
concentrated
will
i
shall
learn
something
new
new
new
the
great
works
down
at
the
harbour
shipyard
foundry
and
machine
shops
were
a
whole
city
in
themselves
and
into
this
world
of
fire
and
smoke
and
glowing
iron
racing
wheels
and
bustle
and
noise
he
was
thrusting
his
way
intent
upon
one
thing
to
learn
and
learn
and
ever
learn
there
were
plenty
of
those
by
him
who
were
content
to
know
their
way
about
the
little
corner
where
they
stood
but
they
would
never
get
any
farther
they
would
end
their
days
workmen
he
would
carve
his
way
through
till
he
stood
among
the
masters
he
had
first
to
put
in
some
months
work
in
the
smithy
then
he
would
be
passed
on
to
the
machine
shops
then
to
work
with
the
carpenters
and
painters
and
finally
in
the
shipyard
the
whole
thing
would
take
a
couple
of
years
but
the
works
and
all
therein
were
already
a
kind
of
new
bible
to
him
a
book
of
books
which
he
must
learn
by
heart
only
wait
and
what
a
place
it
was
for
new
adventures
many
times
a
day
he
would
find
himself
gazing
at
some
new
wonder
sheer
miracle
and
revelation
yet
withal
no
creation
of
god
s
grace
but
an
invention
of
men
press
a
button
and
behold
a
miracle
springs
to
life
he
would
stare
at
the
things
and
the
strain
of
understanding
them
would
sometimes
keep
him
awake
at
night
there
was
something
behind
this
something
that
must
be
spirit
even
though
it
did
not
come
from
god
these
engineers
were
priests
of
a
sort
albeit
they
did
not
preach
nor
pray
it
was
a
new
world
one
day
he
was
put
to
riveting
work
on
an
enormous
boiler
and
for
the
first
time
found
himself
working
with
a
power
that
was
not
the
power
of
his
own
hands
it
was
a
tube
full
of
compressed
air
that
drove
home
the
rivets
in
quick
succession
with
a
clashing
wail
from
the
boiler
that
sounded
all
over
the
town
peer
s
head
and
ears
ached
with
the
noise
but
he
smiled
all
the
same
he
was
used
to
toil
himself
in
weariness
of
body
now
he
stood
here
master
was
mind
and
soul
and
directing
will
he
felt
it
now
for
the
first
time
and
it
sent
a
thrill
of
triumph
through
every
nerve
of
his
body
but
all
through
the
long
evenings
he
sat
alone
reading
reading
and
heard
the
horses
stamping
in
the
stable
below
and
when
he
crept
into
bed
well
after
midnight
there
was
only
one
thing
that
troubled
him
his
utter
loneliness
klaus
brock
lived
with
his
uncle
in
a
fine
house
and
went
to
parties
and
he
lay
here
all
by
himself
if
he
were
to
die
that
very
night
there
would
be
hardly
a
soul
to
care
so
utterly
alone
he
was
in
a
strange
and
indifferent
world
sometimes
it
helped
him
a
little
to
think
of
the
old
mother
at
troen
or
of
the
church
at
home
where
the
vaulted
roof
had
soared
so
high
over
the
swelling
and
all
the
faces
had
looked
so
beautiful
but
the
evening
prayer
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
for
him
there
was
no
bishop
any
more
sitting
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
he
was
to
climb
the
chief
engineer
that
was
there
now
had
nothing
to
do
with
our
lord
or
with
life
in
the
world
to
come
he
would
never
come
so
far
now
that
he
could
go
down
into
the
place
of
torment
where
his
mother
lay
and
bring
her
up
with
him
up
to
salvation
and
whatever
power
and
might
he
gained
he
could
never
stand
in
autumn
evenings
and
lift
up
his
finger
and
make
all
the
stars
break
into
song
something
was
past
and
gone
for
peer
it
was
as
if
he
were
rowing
away
from
a
coast
where
red
clouds
hung
in
the
sky
and
filled
the
air
rowing
farther
and
farther
away
towards
something
quite
new
a
power
stronger
than
himself
had
willed
it
so
one
sunday
as
he
sat
reading
the
door
opened
and
klaus
brock
entered
whistling
with
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
hullo
old
boy
so
this
is
where
you
live
yes
it
is
and
that
s
a
chair
over
but
klaus
remained
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
cap
on
staring
about
the
room
well
i
m
blest
he
said
at
last
if
he
hasn
t
stuck
up
a
photograph
of
himself
on
his
table
well
did
you
never
see
one
before
don
t
you
know
everybody
has
them
not
their
own
photos
you
ass
if
anybody
sees
that
you
ll
never
hear
the
last
of
peer
took
up
the
photograph
and
flung
it
under
the
bed
well
it
was
a
rubbishy
thing
he
muttered
evidently
he
had
made
a
mistake
but
what
about
this
pointing
to
a
coloured
picture
he
had
nailed
up
on
the
wall
klaus
put
on
his
most
manly
air
and
bit
off
a
piece
of
tobacco
plug
ah
that
he
said
trying
not
to
laugh
too
soon
yes
it
s
a
fine
painting
isn
t
it
i
got
it
for
painting
that
s
good
why
you
silly
cow
can
t
you
see
it
s
only
an
oleograph
oh
of
course
you
know
all
about
it
you
always
i
ll
take
you
along
one
day
to
the
art
gallery
said
klaus
then
you
can
see
what
a
real
painting
looks
like
what
s
that
you
ve
got
there
english
reader
yes
put
in
peer
eagerly
hear
me
say
a
and
before
klaus
could
protest
he
had
begun
to
recite
when
he
had
finished
klaus
sat
for
a
while
in
silence
chewing
his
quid
h
m
he
said
at
last
if
our
last
teacher
froken
zebbelin
could
have
heard
that
english
of
yours
we
d
have
had
to
send
for
a
nurse
for
her
hanged
if
we
wouldn
t
this
was
too
much
peer
flung
the
book
against
the
wall
and
told
the
other
to
clear
out
to
the
devil
when
klaus
at
last
managed
to
get
a
word
in
he
said
if
you
are
to
pass
your
entrance
at
the
technical
you
ll
have
to
have
lessons
surely
you
can
see
that
you
must
get
hold
of
a
easy
for
you
to
talk
about
teachers
let
me
tell
you
my
pay
is
twopence
an
i
ll
find
you
one
who
can
take
you
twice
a
week
or
so
in
languages
and
history
and
mathematics
i
daresay
some
sot
of
a
student
would
take
you
on
for
sevenpence
a
lesson
you
could
run
to
that
surely
peer
was
quiet
now
and
a
little
pensive
well
if
i
give
up
butter
and
drink
water
instead
of
coffee
klaus
laughed
but
his
eyes
were
moist
hard
luck
that
he
couldn
t
offer
to
lend
his
comrade
a
few
shillings
but
it
wouldn
t
do
so
the
summer
passed
on
sundays
peer
would
watch
the
young
folks
setting
out
in
the
morning
for
the
country
to
spend
the
whole
day
wandering
in
the
fields
and
woods
while
he
sat
indoors
over
his
books
and
in
the
evening
he
would
stick
his
head
out
of
his
window
that
looked
on
to
the
street
and
would
see
the
lads
and
girls
coming
back
flushed
and
noisy
with
flowers
and
green
boughs
in
their
hats
crazy
with
sunshine
and
fresh
air
and
still
he
must
sit
and
read
on
but
in
the
autumn
when
the
long
nights
set
in
he
would
go
for
a
walk
through
the
streets
before
going
to
bed
as
often
as
not
up
to
the
white
wooden
house
where
the
manager
lived
this
was
klaus
s
home
lights
in
the
windows
and
often
music
the
happy
people
that
lived
here
knew
and
could
do
all
sorts
of
things
that
could
never
be
learned
from
books
no
mistake
he
had
a
goodish
way
to
go
a
long
long
way
but
get
there
he
would
one
day
klaus
happened
to
mention
quite
casually
where
colonel
holm
s
widow
lived
and
late
one
evening
peer
made
his
way
out
there
and
cautiously
approached
the
house
it
was
in
river
street
almost
hidden
in
a
cluster
of
great
trees
and
peer
stood
there
leaning
against
the
garden
fence
trembling
with
some
obscure
emotion
the
long
rows
of
windows
on
both
floors
were
lighted
up
he
could
hear
youthful
laughter
within
and
then
a
young
girl
s
voice
singing
doubtless
they
were
having
a
party
peer
turned
up
his
collar
against
the
wind
and
tramped
back
through
the
town
to
his
lodging
above
the
carter
s
stable
for
the
lonely
working
boy
saturday
evening
is
a
sort
of
festival
he
treats
himself
to
an
extra
wash
gets
out
his
clean
underclothes
from
his
chest
and
changes
and
the
smell
of
the
underclothing
calls
up
keenly
the
thought
of
a
old
woman
who
sewed
and
patched
it
all
and
laid
it
away
so
neatly
folded
he
puts
it
on
carefully
feeling
almost
as
if
it
were
sunday
already
now
and
again
when
a
sunday
seemed
too
long
peer
would
drift
into
the
nearest
church
what
the
parson
said
was
all
very
good
no
doubt
but
peer
did
not
listen
for
him
there
were
only
the
hymns
the
organ
the
lofty
vaulted
roof
the
coloured
windows
here
too
the
faces
of
the
people
looked
otherwise
than
in
the
street
without
touched
as
it
were
by
some
reflection
from
all
that
their
thoughts
aspired
to
reach
and
it
was
so
homelike
here
peer
even
felt
a
sort
of
kinship
with
them
all
though
every
soul
there
was
a
total
stranger
but
at
last
one
day
to
his
surprise
in
the
middle
of
a
hymn
a
voice
within
him
whispered
suddenly
you
should
write
to
your
sister
she
s
as
much
alone
in
the
world
as
you
and
one
evening
peer
sat
down
and
wrote
he
took
quite
a
lordly
tone
saying
that
if
she
wanted
help
in
any
way
she
need
only
let
him
know
and
if
she
would
care
to
move
in
to
town
she
could
come
and
live
with
him
after
which
he
remained
her
affectionate
brother
peer
holm
engineer
apprentice
a
few
days
later
there
came
a
letter
addressed
in
a
fine
slanting
hand
louise
had
just
been
confirmed
the
farmer
she
was
with
wished
to
keep
her
on
as
dairymaid
through
the
winter
but
she
was
afraid
the
work
would
be
too
heavy
for
her
so
she
was
coming
in
to
town
by
the
boat
arriving
on
sunday
evening
with
kind
regards
his
sister
louise
hagen
peer
was
rather
startled
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
good
deal
on
his
shoulders
on
sunday
evening
he
put
on
his
blue
suit
and
stiff
felt
hat
and
walked
down
to
the
quay
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
some
one
else
to
look
after
he
was
to
be
a
father
and
benefactor
from
now
on
to
some
one
worse
off
than
himself
this
was
something
new
the
thought
came
back
to
him
of
the
jolly
gentleman
who
had
come
driving
down
one
day
to
troen
to
look
after
his
little
son
yes
that
was
the
way
to
do
things
that
was
the
sort
of
man
he
would
be
and
involuntarily
he
fell
into
something
of
his
father
s
look
and
step
his
smile
his
lavish
careless
air
well
well
well
well
well
well
he
seemed
saying
to
himself
he
might
almost
in
his
fancy
have
had
a
neat
beard
on
his
chin
the
little
green
steamboat
rounded
the
point
and
lay
in
to
the
quay
the
gangways
were
run
out
porters
jumped
aboard
and
all
the
passengers
came
bundling
ashore
peer
wondered
how
he
was
to
know
her
this
sister
whom
he
had
never
seen
the
crowd
on
deck
soon
thinned
and
people
began
moving
off
from
the
quay
into
the
town
then
peer
was
aware
of
a
young
with
a
box
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
she
wore
a
grey
dress
with
a
black
kerchief
over
her
fair
hair
her
face
was
pale
and
finely
cut
it
was
his
mother
s
face
his
mother
as
a
girl
of
sixteen
now
she
was
looking
about
her
and
now
her
eyes
rested
on
him
half
afraid
half
inquiring
is
it
you
louise
is
that
you
peer
they
stood
for
a
moment
smiling
and
measuring
each
other
with
their
eyes
and
then
shook
hands
together
they
carried
the
box
up
through
the
town
and
peer
was
so
much
of
a
townsman
already
that
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
to
find
himself
walking
through
the
streets
holding
one
end
of
a
trunk
with
a
at
the
other
and
what
a
clatter
her
thick
shoes
made
on
the
pavement
but
all
the
time
he
was
ashamed
to
feel
ashamed
those
blue
arch
eyes
of
hers
constantly
glancing
up
at
him
what
were
they
saying
yes
i
have
come
they
said
and
i
ve
no
one
but
you
in
all
the
world
and
here
i
am
they
kept
on
saying
can
you
play
that
he
asked
with
a
glance
at
her
oh
well
my
playing
s
only
nonsense
she
laughed
and
she
told
how
the
old
sexton
she
had
been
living
with
last
had
not
been
able
to
afford
a
new
dress
for
her
confirmation
and
had
given
her
the
violin
instead
then
didn
t
you
have
a
new
dress
to
be
confirmed
in
but
wasn
t
it
didn
t
you
feel
horrible
with
the
other
girls
standing
by
you
all
dressed
up
fine
she
shut
her
eyes
for
a
moment
oh
yes
it
was
horrid
she
said
a
little
farther
on
she
asked
were
you
boarded
out
at
a
lot
of
places
five
i
pooh
why
that
s
nothing
i
was
at
nine
i
the
girl
was
smiling
again
when
they
came
up
to
his
room
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
round
the
place
it
was
hardly
what
she
had
expected
to
find
and
she
had
not
been
in
town
lodgings
before
and
her
nose
wrinkled
up
a
little
as
she
smelt
the
close
air
it
seemed
so
stuffy
and
so
dark
we
ll
light
the
lamp
he
said
presently
she
laughed
a
little
shyly
and
asked
where
she
was
to
sleep
lord
bless
us
you
may
well
ask
peer
scratched
his
head
there
s
only
one
bed
you
at
that
they
both
burst
out
laughing
the
one
of
us
ll
have
to
sleep
on
the
floor
suggested
the
girl
right
the
very
thing
said
he
delighted
i
ve
two
pillows
you
can
have
one
and
two
rugs
anyway
you
won
t
be
and
then
i
can
put
on
my
other
dress
over
she
said
and
maybe
you
ll
have
an
old
overcoat
splendid
so
we
needn
t
bother
any
more
about
but
where
do
you
get
your
food
from
she
evidently
meant
to
have
everything
cleared
up
at
once
peer
felt
rather
ashamed
that
he
hadn
t
money
enough
to
invite
her
to
a
meal
at
an
then
and
there
but
he
had
to
pay
his
teacher
s
fees
the
next
day
and
his
wanted
refilling
too
i
boil
the
coffee
on
the
stove
there
overnight
he
said
so
that
it
s
all
ready
in
the
morning
and
the
dry
food
i
keep
in
that
box
there
we
ll
see
about
some
supper
he
opened
the
box
fished
out
a
loaf
and
some
butter
and
put
the
kettle
on
the
stove
she
helped
him
to
clear
the
papers
off
the
table
and
spread
the
feast
on
it
there
was
only
one
knife
but
it
was
really
much
better
fun
that
way
than
if
he
had
had
two
and
soon
they
were
seated
on
their
chairs
they
had
a
chair
each
having
their
first
meal
in
their
own
home
he
and
she
together
it
was
settled
that
louise
should
sleep
on
the
floor
and
they
both
laughed
a
great
deal
as
he
tucked
her
in
carefully
so
that
she
shouldn
t
feel
cold
it
was
not
till
afterwards
when
the
lamp
was
out
that
they
noticed
that
the
autumn
gales
had
set
in
and
there
was
a
loud
howling
over
the
housetops
and
there
they
lay
chatting
to
each
other
in
the
dark
before
falling
asleep
it
seemed
a
strange
and
new
thing
to
peer
this
really
having
a
relation
of
his
own
and
a
girl
too
a
young
woman
there
she
lay
on
the
floor
near
by
him
and
from
now
on
he
was
responsible
for
what
was
to
become
of
her
in
the
world
how
should
he
put
that
job
through
he
could
hear
her
turning
over
the
floor
was
hard
very
likely
louise
did
you
ever
see
mother
or
your
father
my
father
she
gave
a
little
laugh
yes
haven
t
you
ever
seen
him
either
why
how
should
i
silly
who
says
that
mother
knew
herself
who
it
was
there
was
a
pause
then
peer
brought
out
rather
awkwardly
we
re
all
alone
then
you
and
yes
we
are
louise
what
are
you
thinking
of
taking
to
now
what
are
you
so
peer
told
her
all
his
plans
she
said
nothing
for
a
little
while
no
doubt
she
was
lying
thinking
of
the
grand
things
he
had
before
him
at
last
she
spoke
do
you
think
does
it
cost
very
much
to
learn
to
be
a
midwife
a
midwife
is
that
what
you
want
to
be
girl
peer
couldn
t
help
laughing
so
this
was
what
she
had
been
planning
in
these
days
since
he
had
offered
to
help
her
on
in
the
world
do
you
think
my
hands
are
too
big
she
ventured
presently
he
could
just
hear
the
whisper
peer
felt
a
pang
of
pity
he
had
noticed
already
how
ill
the
red
swollen
hands
matched
her
pale
face
and
he
knew
that
in
the
country
when
any
one
has
small
fine
hands
people
call
them
midwife
s
we
ll
manage
it
somehow
i
daresay
said
peer
turning
round
to
the
wall
he
had
heard
that
it
cost
several
hundred
crowns
to
go
through
the
course
at
the
midwifery
school
it
would
be
years
before
he
could
get
together
anything
like
that
sum
poor
girl
it
looked
as
if
she
would
have
a
long
time
to
wait
after
that
they
fell
silent
the
roared
over
the
housetops
and
presently
brother
and
sister
were
asleep
when
peer
awoke
the
next
morning
louise
was
about
already
making
coffee
over
the
little
stove
then
she
opened
her
box
took
out
a
yellow
petticoat
and
hung
it
on
a
nail
placed
a
pair
of
new
shoes
against
the
wall
lifted
out
some
and
woollen
stockings
looked
at
them
and
put
them
back
again
the
little
box
held
all
her
worldly
goods
as
peer
was
getting
up
gracious
mercy
she
cried
suddenly
what
is
that
awful
noise
down
in
the
yard
oh
that
s
nothing
to
worry
about
said
peer
it
s
only
the
and
his
wife
they
carry
on
like
that
every
blessed
morning
you
ll
soon
get
used
to
soon
they
were
seated
once
more
at
the
little
table
drinking
coffee
and
laughing
and
looking
at
each
other
louise
had
found
time
to
do
her
hair
the
two
fair
plaits
hung
down
over
her
shoulders
it
was
time
for
peer
to
be
off
and
warning
the
girl
not
to
go
too
far
from
home
and
get
lost
he
ran
down
the
stairs
at
the
works
he
met
klaus
brock
and
told
him
that
his
sister
had
come
to
town
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
asked
klaus
oh
she
ll
stay
with
me
for
the
stay
with
you
but
you
ve
only
got
one
room
and
one
bed
man
well
she
can
sleep
on
the
she
your
sister
she
s
to
sleep
on
the
floor
and
you
in
the
bed
gasped
klaus
peer
saw
he
had
made
a
mistake
again
of
course
i
was
only
fooling
he
hastened
to
say
of
course
it
s
louise
that
s
to
have
the
when
he
came
home
he
found
she
had
borrowed
a
from
the
carter
s
wife
and
had
fried
some
bacon
and
boiled
potatoes
so
that
they
sat
down
to
a
dinner
fit
for
a
prince
but
when
the
girl
s
eyes
fell
on
the
coloured
print
on
the
wall
and
she
asked
if
it
was
a
painting
peer
became
very
grand
at
once
that
a
painting
why
that
s
only
an
oleograph
silly
no
i
ll
take
you
along
to
the
art
gallery
one
day
and
show
you
what
real
paintings
are
and
he
sat
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
saying
well
well
well
well
well
they
agreed
that
louise
had
better
look
out
at
once
for
some
work
to
help
things
along
and
at
the
first
they
tried
she
was
taken
on
at
once
in
the
kitchen
to
wash
the
floor
and
peel
potatoes
when
bedtime
came
he
insisted
on
louise
taking
the
bed
of
course
all
that
was
only
a
joke
last
night
he
explained
here
in
town
women
always
have
the
best
of
everything
that
s
what
s
called
as
he
stretched
himself
on
the
hard
floor
he
had
a
strange
new
feeling
the
narrow
little
garret
seemed
to
have
widened
out
now
that
he
had
to
find
room
in
it
for
a
guest
there
was
something
not
unpleasant
even
in
lying
on
the
hard
floor
since
he
had
chosen
to
do
it
for
some
one
else
s
sake
after
the
lamp
was
out
he
lay
for
a
while
listening
to
her
breathing
then
at
last
yes
is
your
father
was
his
name
hagen
yes
it
says
so
on
the
then
you
re
froken
hagen
sounds
quite
fine
doesn
t
it
uf
now
you
re
making
fun
of
and
when
you
re
a
midwife
froken
hagen
might
quite
well
marry
a
doctor
you
silly
there
s
no
chance
with
hands
like
do
you
think
your
hands
are
too
big
for
you
to
marry
a
doctor
uf
you
are
a
crazy
thing
they
both
snuggled
down
under
the
clothes
with
the
sense
of
ease
and
peace
that
comes
from
sharing
a
room
with
a
good
friend
in
a
happy
humour
well
chapter
vi
so
things
went
on
till
winter
was
far
spent
now
that
louise
too
was
a
and
could
help
with
the
expenses
they
could
dine
luxuriously
at
an
every
day
if
they
pleased
on
at
fourpence
a
portion
they
managed
to
get
a
bed
for
peer
that
could
be
folded
up
during
the
day
and
soon
learned
too
that
good
manners
required
they
should
hang
up
louise
s
big
woollen
shawl
between
them
as
a
modest
screen
while
they
were
dressing
and
undressing
and
louise
began
to
drop
her
country
speech
and
talk
like
her
brother
one
thought
often
came
to
peer
as
he
lay
awake
the
girl
is
the
very
image
of
mother
that
s
certain
what
if
she
were
to
go
the
same
way
well
no
that
she
shall
not
you
re
surely
man
enough
to
see
to
that
nothing
of
that
sort
shall
happen
my
dear
froken
they
saw
but
little
of
each
other
during
the
day
though
for
they
were
apart
from
early
in
the
morning
till
he
came
home
in
the
evening
and
when
he
lectured
her
and
warned
her
to
be
careful
and
take
no
notice
of
men
who
tried
to
speak
to
her
louise
only
laughed
when
klaus
brock
came
up
one
day
to
visit
them
and
made
great
play
with
his
eyes
while
he
talked
to
her
peer
felt
much
inclined
to
take
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
throw
him
downstairs
when
was
near
they
would
wander
in
the
long
evenings
through
the
streets
and
look
in
at
the
dazzlingly
lit
with
their
tempting
glittering
show
of
gold
and
finery
louise
kept
asking
continually
how
much
he
thought
this
thing
or
that
cost
that
lace
or
the
cloak
or
the
stockings
or
those
gold
brooches
wait
till
you
marry
that
doctor
peer
would
say
then
you
can
buy
all
those
so
far
neither
of
them
had
an
overcoat
but
peer
turned
up
his
when
he
felt
cold
and
louise
made
the
most
of
her
thick
woollen
dress
and
a
pair
of
good
country
gloves
that
kept
her
quite
warm
and
she
had
adventured
on
a
hat
now
in
place
of
her
kerchief
and
couldn
t
help
glancing
round
thinking
people
must
notice
how
fine
she
was
on
christmas
eve
he
carried
up
buckets
of
water
from
the
yard
and
she
had
a
great
of
the
whole
room
and
then
they
in
their
turn
had
a
good
wash
helping
each
other
in
country
fashion
to
scrub
shoulders
and
back
peer
was
enough
of
a
townsman
now
to
have
laid
in
a
few
little
presents
to
give
his
sister
but
the
girl
who
had
not
been
used
to
such
doings
had
nothing
for
him
and
wept
a
good
deal
when
she
realised
it
they
ate
cakes
from
the
confectioner
s
with
syrup
over
them
and
drank
chocolate
and
then
louise
played
a
in
her
best
style
on
her
violin
and
peer
read
the
christmas
lessons
from
the
it
was
all
just
like
what
they
used
to
do
at
troen
on
christmas
eve
and
that
night
after
the
lamp
was
put
out
they
lay
awake
talking
over
plans
for
the
future
they
promised
each
other
that
when
they
had
got
well
on
in
the
world
he
in
his
line
and
she
in
hers
they
would
manage
to
live
near
each
other
so
that
their
children
could
play
together
and
grow
up
good
friends
didn
t
she
think
that
was
a
good
idea
yes
indeed
she
did
and
did
he
really
mean
it
yes
of
course
he
meant
it
really
but
later
on
in
the
winter
when
she
sat
at
home
in
the
evenings
waiting
for
him
he
often
worked
overtime
she
was
sometimes
almost
afraid
there
was
his
step
on
the
stairs
if
it
was
hurried
and
eager
she
would
tremble
a
little
for
the
moment
he
was
inside
the
door
he
would
burst
out
hurrah
my
girl
i
ve
learnt
something
new
i
tell
you
have
you
peer
and
then
out
would
pour
a
torrent
of
talk
about
motors
and
power
and
pressures
and
cylinders
and
cranes
and
screws
and
she
would
sit
and
listen
and
smile
but
of
course
understood
not
a
word
of
it
all
and
as
soon
as
peer
discovered
this
he
would
get
perfectly
furious
and
call
her
a
little
blockhead
then
there
were
the
long
evenings
when
he
sat
at
home
reading
by
himself
or
with
his
teacher
and
she
had
to
sit
so
desperately
still
that
she
hardly
dared
take
a
stitch
with
her
needle
but
one
day
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
his
sister
ought
to
be
studying
too
so
he
set
her
a
piece
of
history
to
learn
by
the
next
evening
but
time
to
learn
it
where
was
that
to
come
from
and
then
he
started
her
writing
to
his
dictation
to
improve
her
spelling
and
all
the
time
she
kept
dropping
off
to
sleep
she
had
washed
so
many
floors
and
peeled
so
many
potatoes
in
the
daytime
that
now
her
body
felt
like
lead
look
here
my
fine
girl
he
would
storm
at
her
raging
up
and
down
the
room
if
you
think
you
can
get
on
in
the
world
without
education
you
re
most
infernally
he
succeeded
in
reducing
her
to
tears
but
it
wasn
t
long
before
her
head
had
fallen
forward
on
the
table
again
and
she
was
fast
asleep
so
he
realised
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
help
her
to
bed
as
quietly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
wake
her
up
some
way
on
in
the
spring
peer
fell
sick
when
the
doctor
came
he
looked
round
the
room
sniffed
and
frowned
do
you
call
this
a
place
for
human
beings
to
live
in
he
asked
louise
who
had
taken
the
day
off
how
can
you
expect
to
keep
well
he
examined
peer
who
lay
coughing
his
face
a
burning
red
yes
yes
just
as
i
expected
inflammation
of
the
he
glanced
round
the
room
once
more
better
get
him
off
to
the
hospital
at
once
he
said
louise
sat
there
in
terror
at
the
idea
that
peer
was
to
be
taken
away
and
then
as
the
doctor
was
going
he
looked
at
her
more
closely
and
said
you
d
do
well
to
be
a
bit
careful
yourself
my
good
girl
you
look
as
if
you
wanted
a
change
to
a
decent
room
with
a
little
more
light
and
air
pretty
badly
soon
after
he
was
gone
the
hospital
ambulance
arrived
peer
was
carried
down
the
stairs
on
a
stretcher
and
the
box
on
wheels
opened
its
door
and
swallowed
him
up
and
they
would
not
even
let
her
go
with
him
all
through
the
evening
she
sat
in
their
room
alone
sobbing
the
hospital
was
one
of
the
good
kind
that
people
don
t
come
near
if
they
can
help
it
because
the
walls
seem
to
reek
of
the
discomfort
and
wretchedness
that
reign
inside
the
general
wards
where
the
poor
folks
went
were
always
so
overcrowded
that
patients
with
all
sorts
of
different
diseases
had
to
be
packed
into
the
same
rooms
and
often
infected
each
other
when
an
operation
was
to
be
performed
things
were
managed
in
the
most
cheerfully
casual
way
the
patient
was
laid
on
a
stretcher
and
carried
across
the
open
yard
often
in
the
depth
of
winter
and
as
he
was
always
covered
up
with
a
rug
the
others
usually
thought
he
was
being
taken
off
to
the
when
peer
opened
his
eyes
he
was
aware
of
a
man
in
a
white
blouse
standing
by
the
foot
of
his
bed
why
i
believe
he
s
said
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
a
doctor
peer
found
out
afterwards
from
a
nurse
that
he
had
been
unconscious
for
more
than
hours
he
lay
there
day
after
day
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
stabbing
of
a
iron
boring
through
his
chest
and
cutting
off
his
breathing
some
one
would
come
every
now
and
then
and
pour
port
wine
and
naphtha
into
his
mouth
and
morning
and
evening
he
was
washed
carefully
with
warm
water
by
gentle
hands
but
little
by
little
the
room
grew
lighter
and
his
gruel
began
to
have
some
taste
and
at
last
he
began
to
distinguish
the
people
in
the
beds
near
by
and
to
chat
with
them
on
his
right
lay
a
dock
labourer
with
a
broken
nose
his
disease
whatever
it
might
be
was
clearly
different
from
peer
s
he
plagued
the
nurse
with
complaints
of
the
food
swearing
he
would
report
about
it
on
the
other
side
lay
an
emaciated
cobbler
with
a
soft
brown
beard
like
the
christ
pictures
and
cheeks
glowing
with
fever
he
was
dying
of
cancer
at
right
angles
with
him
lay
a
man
with
the
face
and
figure
of
a
prophet
a
moses
all
bushy
white
hair
and
beard
he
was
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
and
his
cough
was
like
a
riveting
machine
huh
he
would
groan
if
only
i
could
get
across
to
germany
there
d
be
a
chance
for
me
beside
him
was
a
fellow
with
short
beard
and
piercing
eyes
who
was
a
little
off
his
head
and
imagined
himself
a
corporal
of
the
guards
often
at
night
the
others
would
be
wakened
by
his
springing
upright
in
bed
and
calling
out
attention
one
man
lay
moaning
and
groaning
all
the
time
turning
from
side
to
side
of
a
body
covered
with
sores
but
one
day
he
managed
to
swallow
some
of
the
alcohol
they
used
as
lotion
and
after
that
lay
singing
and
weeping
alternately
and
there
was
a
man
with
glasses
a
commercial
traveller
he
had
put
a
bullet
into
his
head
but
the
doctors
had
managed
to
get
it
out
again
and
now
he
lay
and
praised
the
lord
for
his
miraculous
deliverance
it
was
strange
to
peer
to
lie
awake
at
night
in
this
great
room
in
the
dim
light
of
the
it
seemed
as
if
beings
from
the
land
of
the
dead
were
stirring
in
those
beds
round
about
him
but
in
the
daytime
when
friends
and
relations
of
the
patients
came
peer
could
hardly
keep
from
crying
the
cobbler
had
a
wife
and
a
little
girl
who
came
and
sat
beside
him
gazing
at
him
as
if
they
could
never
let
him
go
the
prophet
too
had
a
wife
who
wept
inconsolably
and
all
the
rest
seemed
to
have
some
one
or
other
to
care
for
them
but
where
was
louise
why
did
louise
never
come
the
man
on
the
right
had
a
sister
who
came
sweeping
in
gorgeous
in
her
trailing
soiled
silk
dress
her
shoes
were
down
at
heel
but
her
hat
was
a
wonder
with
enormous
plumes
hallo
ugly
how
goes
it
she
said
and
sat
down
and
crossed
her
legs
then
the
pair
would
talk
mysteriously
of
people
with
strange
names
the
flea
cockroach
the
galliot
king
ring
and
the
like
evidently
friends
of
theirs
one
day
she
managed
to
bring
in
a
small
bottle
of
brandy
a
present
from
the
hedgehog
and
smuggle
it
under
the
bedclothes
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
and
the
coast
was
clear
peer
s
neighbour
drew
out
the
bottle
managed
to
work
the
cork
out
and
offered
him
a
drink
here
s
luck
sonny
do
you
no
peer
would
rather
not
then
followed
a
gurgling
sound
from
the
docker
s
bed
and
soon
he
too
was
lying
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
at
last
one
day
louise
came
she
was
wearing
her
neat
hat
and
had
a
little
bundle
in
her
hand
and
as
she
came
in
looking
round
the
room
the
close
air
of
the
seemed
to
turn
her
a
little
faint
but
then
she
caught
sight
of
peer
and
smiled
and
came
cautiously
to
him
holding
out
her
hand
she
was
astonished
to
find
him
so
changed
but
as
she
sat
down
by
his
pillow
she
was
still
smiling
though
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
so
you
ve
come
at
last
then
said
peer
they
wouldn
t
let
me
in
before
she
said
with
a
sob
and
then
peer
learned
that
she
had
come
there
every
single
day
but
only
to
be
told
that
he
was
too
ill
to
see
visitors
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
craned
his
head
forward
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
modest
young
girl
and
meanwhile
she
was
pulling
out
of
the
bundle
the
offering
she
had
brought
a
bottle
of
lemonade
and
some
oranges
but
it
was
a
day
or
two
later
that
something
happened
which
peer
was
often
to
remember
in
the
days
to
come
he
had
been
dozing
through
the
afternoon
and
when
he
woke
the
lamp
was
lit
and
a
dull
yellow
lay
over
the
ward
the
others
seemed
to
be
sleeping
all
was
very
quiet
only
the
man
with
the
sores
was
whimpering
softly
then
the
door
opened
and
peer
saw
louise
glide
in
softly
and
cautiously
with
her
under
her
arm
she
did
not
come
over
to
where
her
brother
lay
but
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
ward
and
taking
out
her
violin
began
to
play
the
easter
hymn
the
mighty
host
in
white
den
store
hvide
flok
vi
the
man
with
the
sores
ceased
whimpering
the
patients
in
the
beds
round
about
opened
their
eyes
the
docker
with
the
broken
nose
sat
up
in
bed
and
the
cobbler
roused
from
his
feverish
dream
lifted
himself
on
his
elbow
and
whispered
it
is
the
redeemer
i
knew
thou
wouldst
then
there
was
silence
louise
stood
there
with
eyes
fixed
on
her
violin
playing
her
simple
best
the
consumptive
raised
his
head
and
forgot
to
cough
the
corporal
slowly
stiffened
his
body
to
attention
the
commercial
traveller
folded
his
hands
and
stared
before
him
the
simple
tones
of
the
hymn
seemed
to
be
giving
new
life
to
all
these
unfortunates
the
light
of
it
was
in
their
faces
but
to
peer
watching
his
sister
as
she
stood
there
in
the
it
seemed
as
if
she
grew
to
be
one
with
the
hymn
itself
and
that
wings
to
soar
were
given
her
when
she
had
finished
she
came
softly
over
to
his
bed
stroked
his
forehead
with
her
swollen
hand
then
glided
out
and
disappeared
as
silently
as
she
had
come
for
a
long
time
all
was
silent
in
the
dismal
ward
until
at
last
the
dying
cobbler
murmured
i
thank
thee
i
knew
i
knew
thou
wert
not
far
when
peer
left
the
hospital
the
doctor
said
he
had
better
not
begin
work
again
at
once
he
should
take
a
holiday
in
the
country
and
pick
up
his
strength
easy
enough
for
you
to
talk
thought
peer
and
a
couple
of
days
later
he
was
at
the
workshop
again
but
his
ways
with
his
sister
were
more
considerate
than
before
and
he
searched
about
until
he
had
found
her
a
place
as
seamstress
and
saved
her
from
her
heavy
and
soon
louise
began
to
notice
with
delight
that
her
hands
were
much
less
red
and
swollen
than
they
had
been
they
were
actually
getting
soft
and
pretty
by
degrees
next
winter
she
sat
at
home
in
the
evenings
while
he
read
and
made
herself
a
dress
and
cloak
and
trimmed
a
new
hat
so
that
peer
soon
had
quite
an
elegant
young
lady
to
walk
out
with
but
when
men
turned
round
to
look
at
her
as
she
passed
he
would
scowl
and
clench
his
fists
at
last
one
day
this
was
too
much
for
louise
and
she
rebelled
now
peer
i
tell
you
plainly
i
won
t
go
out
with
you
if
you
go
on
like
all
right
my
girl
he
growled
i
ll
look
after
you
though
never
fear
we
re
not
going
to
have
mother
s
story
over
again
with
well
but
after
all
i
m
a
and
you
can
t
prevent
people
looking
at
me
idiot
klaus
brock
had
been
entered
at
the
technical
college
that
autumn
and
went
about
now
with
the
college
badge
in
his
cap
and
sported
a
and
a
cigarette
he
had
grown
into
a
big
fellow
and
walked
with
a
little
swing
in
his
step
a
thick
shock
of
black
hair
fell
over
his
forehead
and
he
had
a
way
of
looking
about
him
as
if
to
say
anything
the
matter
all
right
i
m
ready
one
evening
he
came
in
and
asked
louise
to
go
with
him
to
the
theatre
the
young
girl
blushed
red
with
joy
and
peer
could
not
refuse
but
he
was
waiting
for
them
outside
the
yard
gate
when
they
came
back
on
a
sunday
soon
after
klaus
was
there
again
asking
her
to
come
out
for
a
drive
this
time
she
did
not
even
look
to
peer
for
leave
but
said
yes
at
once
just
you
wait
said
peer
to
himself
and
when
she
came
back
that
evening
he
read
her
a
terrific
lecture
soon
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
girl
was
going
about
with
eyes
dreaming
dreams
of
which
she
would
never
speak
to
him
and
as
the
days
went
on
her
hands
grew
whiter
and
she
moved
more
lightly
as
if
to
the
rhythm
of
unheard
music
always
as
she
went
about
the
room
on
her
household
tasks
she
was
crooning
some
song
it
seemed
that
there
was
some
joy
in
her
soul
that
must
find
an
outlet
one
saturday
in
the
late
spring
she
had
just
come
home
and
was
getting
the
supper
when
peer
came
tramping
in
dressed
in
his
best
and
carrying
a
parcel

she
dried
her
hand
and
grasped
his
here
you

sausages
anchovies
and
here
s
a
bottle
of
brandy
the
first

klaus
came
and
the
two
youths
drank
toddy
and
smoked
and
made
speeches
and
louise
played
patriotic
songs
on
her
violin
and
klaus
gazed
at
her
and
asked
for
more
when
he
left
peer
went
with
him
and
as
the
two
walked
down
the
street
klaus
took
his
friend
s
arm
and
pointed
to
the
pale
moon
riding
high
above
the
fjord
and
vowed
never
to
give
him
up
till
he
stood
at
the
very
top
of
the
tree
never
never
besides
he
was
a
socialist
now
he
said
and
meant
to
raise
a
revolt
against
all
class
distinctions
and
louise
louise
was
the
most
glorious
girl
in
all
the
world
and
now

as
well

sooner
as
later
they
were
as
good
as
engaged
to
be
married
he
and
louise
peer
pushed
him
away
and
stood
staring
at
him
go

and
go
to
bed
he
said
ha
you
think
i
m
not
man
enough
to
defy
my
people

defy
the
whole
world
said
peer
next
morning
as
louise
lay
in
bed
she
had
asked
to
have
her
breakfast
there
for
once
in
a
way
she
suddenly
began
to
laugh
what
are
you
about
now
she
asked
teasingly
shaving
said
peer
beginning
operations

desperate

your
skin

great
goodness
she
said

had
been
working
himself
up
to
this
for
a
year
or
more
and
now
he
was
going
to
do
it
he
would
show
what
he
was
made
of
whether
he
was
a
snivelling
child
or
a
man
that
could
stand
up
to
any
in
the
world
he
was
shaving
for
the
first
time
quite
true
and
the
reason
was
that
it
was
no
ordinary
day
but
a
great
occasion

toilet
over
he
put
on
his
best
hat
with
a
flourish
and
set
out
louise
stayed
at
home
all
the
morning
waiting
for
his
return
and
at
last
she
heard
him
on
the
stairs
puh
he
said
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
well
did

he
laughed
wiped
his
forehead
and
drew
a
book
from
his

the
technical
college
he
said
and
i
told
him
i
had

heavens

he
shifted
his
glasses
down
his
nose
and

here
with
tales
of

bank
book

some
legal
right

he
said
and
got
perfectly
furious
then
i
hinted
that
i
d
rather
ask
a
lawyer
about
it
and
make
sure
and
at
that
he
regularly
boiled
with
rage
and
waved
his
arms
all
about
but
he
gave
in
pretty
soon
all
the

summer
holidays
as
the
summer
wore
on
the
town

baking
in
the
heat
reeking
of
drains
and
the
air
from
the
stable
came
up
to
the
couple
in
the
garret
so
heavy
and
foul
that
they
were
sometimes
nearly
stifled

obliged
to

to
the
workshops
he
could
not

was
just
starting
with
a
working

and
pressed
down
her
tongue

the
rest
when
he
came
back
he
hurried
home
suddenly
thinking
of
louise
and
her
sore
throat
he
found
the
greasing
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
while
his
wife
leaned
out
of
a
window
scolding
at
him
your
sister
repeated
the
carter
turning
round
his
face
with
its
great
red
lump
of
nose
she
s
gone
to
hospital
diphtheria
hospital
she
has
doctor
was
here
over
a
week
ago
and
took
her
off
they
ve
been
here
since
poking
round
and
asking
who
she
was
and
where
she
belonged
well
we
didn
t
know
and
asking
where
you
were
too
and
we
didn
t
know
either
she
was
real
bad
if
you
ask
me
peer
hastened
off
it
was
a
hot
day
and
the
air
was
close
and
heavy
on
he
went
all
down
the
whole
length
of
sea
street
through
the
fishermen
s
quarter
and
a
good
way
further
out
round
the
bay
and
then
he
saw
a
cart
coming
towards
him
an
ordinary
with
a
coffin
on
it
the
driver
sat
on
the
cart
and
another
man
walked
behind
hat
in
hand
peer
ran
on
and
at
last
came
in
sight
of
the
long
yellow
building
at
the
far
end
of
the
bay
he
remembered
all
the
horrible
stories
he
had
heard
about
the
treatment
of
diphtheria
patients
how
their
throats
had
to
be
cut
open
to
give
them
air
or
something
burned
out
of
them
with
irons
oh
when
at
last
he
had
reached
the
high
fence
and
rung
the
bell
he
stood
breathless
and
dripping
with
sweat
leaning
against
the
gate
there
was
a
sound
of
steps
within
a
key
was
turned
and
a
porter
with
a
red
moustache
and
freckles
about
his
hard
blue
eyes
thrust
out
his
head
what
d
you
want
to
go
ringing
like
that
for
froken
hagen
louise
hagen
is
she
better
how
how
is
she
lou
louise
hagen
a
girl
called
louise
hagen
is
it
her
you
ve
come
to
ask
about
yes
she
s
my
sister
tell
me
or
let
me
in
to
see
wait
a
bit
you
don
t
mean
a
girl
that
was
brought
in
here
about
a
week
ago
yes
yes
but
let
me
we
ve
had
no
end
of
bother
and
trouble
about
that
girl
trying
to
find
out
where
she
came
from
and
if
she
had
people
here
but
of
course
this
weather
we
couldn
t
possibly
keep
her
any
longer
didn
t
you
meet
a
coffin
on
a
cart
as
you
came
along
what
what
you
don
t
mean
well
you
should
have
come
before
you
know
she
did
ask
a
lot
for
some
one
called
peer
and
she
got
the
matron
to
write
somewhere
wasn
t
it
to
levanger
were
you
the
fellow
she
was
asking
for
so
you
came
at
last
oh
well
she
died
four
or
five
days
ago
and
they
re
just
gone
now
to
bury
her
in
mary
s
peer
turned
round
and
looked
out
over
the
bay
at
the
town
that
lay
sunlit
and
beyond
towards
the
town
he
began
to
walk
but
his
step
grew
quicker
and
quicker
and
at
last
he
took
off
his
cap
and
ran
panting
and
sobbing
as
he
went
have
i
been
drinking
was
the
thought
that
whirled
through
his
brain
or
why
can
t
i
wake
what
is
it
what
is
it
and
still
he
ran
there
was
no
cart
in
sight
as
yet
the
little
streets
of
the
were
all
twists
and
turns
at
last
he
reached
sea
street
once
more
and
there
there
far
ahead
was
the
cart
almost
at
once
it
turned
off
to
the
right
and
disappeared
and
when
peer
reached
the
turning
it
was
not
to
be
seen
still
he
ran
on
at
haphazard
there
seemed
to
be
other
people
in
the
streets
children
flying
red
balloons
women
with
baskets
men
with
straw
hats
and
but
peer
marked
his
line
and
ran
forward
thrusting
people
aside
upsetting
those
in
his
way
and
dashing
on
again
in
king
street
he
came
in
sight
of
the
cart
once
more
nearer
this
time
the
man
walking
behind
it
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
had
red
curling
hair
and
walked
with
a
curtsying
gait
giving
at
the
knees
and
turning
out
his
toes
no
doubt
he
made
his
living
as
mourner
at
funerals
to
which
no
other
mourners
came
as
the
cart
turned
into
the
churchyard
peer
came
up
with
it
and
tried
to
follow
at
a
walk
but
stumbled
and
could
hardly
keep
his
feet
the
man
behind
the
cart
looked
at
him
what
s
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
the
driver
looked
round
but
drove
on
again
at
once
the
cart
stopped
and
peer
stood
by
leaning
against
a
tree
for
support
a
third
man
came
up
he
seemed
to
be
the
gravedigger
and
he
heard
the
three
discussing
how
long
they
might
have
to
wait
for
the
parson
the
time
s
just
about
up
isn
t
it
said
the
driver
taking
out
his
watch
ay
the
clerk
said
he
d
be
here
by
now
agreed
the
gravedigger
and
blew
his
nose
soon
the
priest
came
in
sight
wearing
his
black
robe
and
white
ruff
there
were
doubtless
to
be
other
funerals
that
day
peer
sank
down
on
a
bench
and
looked
stupidly
on
while
the
coffin
was
lifted
from
the
cart
carried
to
the
grave
and
lowered
down
a
man
with
spectacles
and
a
red
nose
came
up
with
a
and
sang
something
over
the
grave
the
priest
lifted
the
spade
and
at
the
sound
of
the
first
spadeful
of
earth
falling
on
louise
s
coffin
peer
started
as
if
struck
and
all
but
fell
from
his
seat
when
he
looked
up
again
the
place
was
deserted
the
bell
was
ringing
and
a
crowd
was
collecting
in
another
part
of
the
churchyard
peer
sat
where
he
was
quite
still
in
the
evening
when
the
gravedigger
came
to
lock
the
gates
he
had
to
take
the
young
man
by
the
shoulder
and
shake
him
to
his
senses
time
he
said
you
must
go
peer
rose
and
tried
to
walk
and
by
and
by
he
was
stumbling
blindly
out
through
the
gate
and
down
the
street
and
after
a
time
he
found
himself
climbing
a
flight
of
stairs
above
a
once
in
his
room
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
bed
as
he
was
and
lay
there
still
the
close
heat
of
the
day
had
broken
in
a
downpour
of
rain
which
drummed
upon
the
roof
above
his
head
and
poured
in
torrents
through
the
gutters
instinctively
peer
started
up
louise
was
out
in
the
rain
she
would
need
her
cloak
he
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
as
if
to
find
it
then
he
stopped
short
and
sank
slowly
back
upon
the
bed
he
drew
up
his
feet
under
him
and
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
his
brain
was
full
of
changing
hurrying
visions
of
storm
and
death
of
human
beings
helpless
in
a
universe
coldly
and
indifferently
ruled
by
a
will
that
knows
no
pity
then
for
the
first
time
it
was
as
if
he
lifted
up
his
head
against
heaven
itself
and
cried
there
is
no
sense
in
all
this
i
will
not
bear
later
in
the
night
when
he
found
himself
mechanically
folding
his
hands
for
the
evening
prayer
he
had
learnt
to
say
as
a
child
he
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
clenched
his
fists
and
cried
aloud
no
no
no
never
never
once
more
it
came
to
him
that
there
was
something
in
god
like
the
schoolmaster
he
took
the
side
of
those
who
were
well
off
already
yes
they
who
have
parents
and
home
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
worldly
goods
them
i
protect
and
care
for
but
here
s
a
boy
alone
in
the
world
struggling
and
fighting
his
way
on
as
best
he
can
from
him
i
will
take
the
only
thing
he
has
that
boy
is
nothing
to
any
one
let
him
be
punished
because
he
is
poor
and
cast
down
to
the
earth
for
there
is
none
to
care
for
him
that
boy
is
nothing
to
any
one
oh
oh
oh
he
clenched
his
fists
and
beat
them
against
the
wall
his
whole
little
world
was
broken
to
pieces
either
god
did
not
exist
at
all
or
he
was
cold
and
pitiless
one
way
of
it
was
as
bad
as
the
other
the
heavenly
country
dissolved
into
cloud
and
melted
away
and
above
was
nothing
but
empty
space
no
more
folding
of
your
hands
like
a
fool
walk
on
the
earth
and
lift
up
your
head
and
defy
heaven
and
fate
as
you
defied
the
schoolmaster
your
mother
has
no
need
of
you
to
save
her
she
is
not
anywhere
any
more
she
is
dead
dead
and
turned
to
clay
and
more
than
that
there
is
not
for
her
or
for
you
or
any
other
being
in
this
world
still
he
lay
there
he
would
fain
have
slept
but
seemed
instead
to
sink
into
a
vague
twilight
that
rocked
him
rocked
him
on
its
dark
and
golden
waves
and
now
he
heard
a
sound
what
was
it
a
violin
the
mighty
host
in
white
louise
is
it
you
and
playing
he
could
see
her
now
out
there
in
the
twilight
how
pale
she
was
but
still
she
played
and
now
he
understood
what
that
twilight
was
it
was
a
world
beyond
the
consciousness
of
daily
life
and
that
world
belonged
to
him
peer
let
me
stay
and
something
in
him
answered
yes
you
shall
stay
louise
even
though
there
is
no
god
and
no
immortality
you
shall
stay
and
then
she
smiled
and
still
she
played
and
it
was
as
though
he
were
building
a
little
vaulted
chapel
for
her
in
defiance
of
heaven
and
of
god
as
though
he
were
ringing
out
with
his
own
hands
a
great
eternal
chime
for
her
sake
what
was
happening
to
him
there
was
none
to
comfort
him
yet
it
ended
as
he
lay
there
with
his
pouring
out
something
of
his
innermost
being
as
an
offering
to
all
that
lives
to
the
earth
and
the
stars
until
all
seemed
rocking
rocking
with
him
on
the
stately
waves
of
the
psalm
he
lay
there
with
eyes
stretching
out
his
hands
as
though
afraid
to
wake
and
find
it
all
nothing
but
a
beautiful
dream
chapter
vii
the
clock
bell
at
the
technical
college
had
just
begun
to
ring
and
a
stream
of
students
appeared
out
of
the
long
straggling
buildings
and
poured
through
the
gate
breaking
up
then
into
little
knots
and
groups
that
went
their
several
ways
into
the
town
it
was
a
motley
crowd
of
young
men
of
all
ages
from
seventeen
to
thirty
or
more
students
of
the
everlasting
type
sent
here
by
their
parents
as
a
last
resource
for
he
can
always
be
an
engineer
young
sparks
who
paid
more
attention
to
their
toilet
than
their
books
and
hoped
to
get
through
somehow
without
troubling
to
work
and
stiff
youths
of
soldierly
bearing
who
had
been
ploughed
for
the
army
but
who
likewise
could
always
be
there
were
who
had
crammed
themselves
through
their
intermediate
at
a
spurt
and
now
wore
the
college
cap
above
their
rough
grey
homespun
and
dreamed
of
getting
through
in
no
time
and
turning
into
great
men
with
starched
cuffs
and
there
were
pale
young
enthusiasts
too
who
would
probably
end
as
actors
and
there
were
also
quondam
actors
killed
by
the
critics
but
still
sufficiently
alive
it
seemed
to
be
and
as
the
young
fellows
hurried
on
their
gay
and
careless
way
through
the
town
an
older
man
here
and
there
might
look
round
after
them
with
a
smile
of
some
sadness
it
was
easy
to
say
what
fate
awaited
most
of
them
college
ended
they
would
be
scattered
like
birds
of
passage
throughout
the
wide
world
some
to
fall
by
sunstroke
in
africa
or
be
murdered
by
natives
in
china
others
to
become
mining
kings
in
the
mountains
of
peru
or
heads
of
great
factories
in
siberia
thousands
of
miles
from
home
and
friends
the
whole
planet
was
their
home
only
a
few
of
them
not
always
the
shining
lights
would
stay
at
home
with
a
post
on
the
state
railways
to
sit
in
an
office
and
watch
their
salaries
mount
by
increments
of
every
fifth
year
that
s
a
devil
of
a
fellow
that
brother
of
yours
that
s
here
said
klaus
brock
to
peer
one
day
as
they
were
walking
into
town
together
with
their
books
under
their
arms
now
look
here
klaus
once
for
all
be
good
enough
to
stop
calling
him
my
brother
and
another
thing
you
re
never
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
about
my
father
having
been
anything
but
a
farmer
my
name
s
holm
and
i
m
called
so
after
my
father
s
farm
just
remember
that
will
you
oh
all
right
don
t
excite
do
you
suppose
i
d
give
that
coxcomb
the
triumph
of
thinking
i
want
to
make
up
to
him
no
no
of
course
klaus
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
on
whistling
or
that
i
want
to
make
trouble
for
that
fine
family
of
his
no
i
may
find
a
way
to
take
it
out
of
him
some
day
but
it
won
t
be
that
well
but
damn
it
man
you
can
surely
stand
hearing
what
people
say
about
and
klaus
went
on
to
tell
his
story
ferdinand
holm
it
seemed
was
the
despair
of
his
family
he
had
thrown
up
his
studies
at
the
military
academy
because
he
thought
soldiers
and
soldiering
ridiculous
then
he
had
made
a
short
experiment
with
theology
but
found
that
worse
still
and
finally
having
discovered
that
engineering
was
at
any
rate
an
honest
trade
he
had
come
to
anchor
at
the
technical
college
what
do
you
say
to
that
asked
klaus
i
don
t
see
anything
so
remarkable
about
wait
a
bit
the
cream
of
the
story
s
to
come
a
few
weeks
ago
he
thrashed
a
policeman
in
the
street
said
he
d
insulted
a
child
or
something
there
was
a
fearful
scandal
arrest
the
fine
and
so
forth
and
last
winter
what
must
he
do
but
get
engaged
formally
and
publicly
engaged
to
one
of
his
mother
s
maids
and
when
his
mother
sent
the
girl
off
behind
his
back
he
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
and
left
home
altogether
and
now
he
does
nothing
but
breathe
fire
and
slaughter
against
the
upper
classes
and
all
their
works
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
good
man
what
the
deuce
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
me
well
i
think
it
s
confoundedly
plucky
of
him
anyhow
said
klaus
and
for
my
part
i
shall
get
to
know
him
if
i
can
he
s
read
an
awful
lot
they
say
and
has
a
damned
clever
head
on
his
on
his
very
first
day
at
the
college
peer
had
learned
who
ferdinand
holm
was
and
had
studied
him
with
interest
he
was
a
tall
fellow
with
hair
and
freckled
face
and
wore
a
dark
tortoiseshell
he
did
not
wear
the
usual
college
cap
but
a
stiff
grey
felt
hat
and
he
looked
about
four
or
five
and
twenty
wait
thought
peer
to
himself
wait
my
fine
fellow
yes
you
were
there
no
doubt
when
they
turned
me
out
of
the
churchyard
that
day
but
all
that
won
t
help
you
here
you
may
have
got
the
start
of
me
at
first
and
learned
this
that
and
the
other
but
you
just
but
one
morning
out
in
the
quadrangle
he
noticed
that
ferdinand
holm
in
his
turn
was
looking
at
him
in
fact
was
putting
his
glasses
straight
to
get
a
better
view
of
him
and
peer
turned
round
at
once
and
walked
away
ferdinand
however
had
been
put
into
a
higher
class
almost
at
once
on
the
strength
of
his
matriculation
also
he
was
going
in
for
a
different
branch
of
the
work
roads
and
railway
construction
so
that
it
was
only
in
the
quadrangle
and
the
passages
that
the
two
ever
met
but
one
afternoon
soon
after
christmas
peer
was
standing
at
work
in
the
big
when
he
heard
steps
behind
him
and
turning
round
saw
klaus
brock
and
ferdinand
holm
i
wanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
holm
and
when
klaus
had
introduced
them
he
held
out
a
large
white
hand
with
a
red
on
the
first
finger
we
re
namesakes
i
understand
and
brock
here
tells
me
you
take
your
name
from
a
country
place
called
yes
my
father
was
a
plain
country
farmer
said
peer
and
at
once
felt
annoyed
with
himself
for
the
ring
of
humility
the
words
seemed
to
have
well
the
best
is
good
enough
said
the
other
with
a
smile
i
say
though
has
the
class
gone
as
far
as
this
in
projection
drawing
excuse
my
asking
you
see
we
had
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
of
thing
at
the
military
academy
so
that
i
know
a
little
about
thought
peer
oh
you
d
like
to
give
me
a
little
good
advice
would
you
if
you
dared
aloud
he
said
no
the
drawing
was
on
the
blackboard
the
senior
class
left
it
there
and
i
thought
i
d
like
to
see
what
i
could
make
out
of
the
other
sent
him
a
sidelong
glance
then
he
nodded
said
hope
we
shall
meet
again
and
walked
off
his
boots
creaking
slightly
as
he
went
his
easy
manners
his
gait
the
tone
of
his
voice
all
seemed
to
irritate
and
humiliate
peer
never
mind
just
let
him
wait
days
passed
and
weeks
peer
soon
found
another
object
to
work
for
than
getting
the
better
of
ferdinand
holm
louise
s
dresses
hung
still
untouched
in
his
room
her
shoes
stood
under
the
bed
it
still
seemed
to
him
that
some
day
she
must
open
the
door
and
walk
in
and
when
he
lay
there
alone
at
night
the
riddle
was
always
with
him
where
is
she
now
why
should
she
have
died
would
he
never
meet
her
again
he
saw
her
always
as
she
had
stood
that
day
playing
to
the
sick
folks
in
the
hospital
ward
but
now
she
was
dressed
in
white
and
it
seemed
quite
natural
now
that
she
had
wings
he
heard
her
music
too
it
cradled
and
rocked
him
and
all
this
came
to
be
a
little
world
apart
where
he
could
take
refuge
for
sunday
peace
and
devotion
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
faith
or
religion
but
it
was
there
and
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
his
work
in
the
daytime
he
would
divine
as
in
a
quite
separate
consciousness
the
tones
of
a
drawn
across
the
strings
like
reddish
waves
coming
to
him
from
far
off
filling
him
with
harmony
till
he
smiled
without
knowing
it
often
though
a
sort
of
hunger
would
come
upon
him
to
let
his
being
unfold
in
a
great
wide
wave
of
organ
music
in
the
church
but
to
church
he
never
went
any
more
he
would
stride
by
a
church
door
with
a
kind
of
defiance
it
might
indeed
be
an
almighty
will
that
had
taken
louise
from
him
but
if
so
he
did
not
mean
to
give
thanks
to
such
a
will
or
bow
down
before
it
it
was
as
though
he
had
in
view
a
coming
reckoning
his
reckoning
with
something
far
out
in
eternity
and
he
must
see
to
it
that
when
that
time
came
he
could
feel
free
free
on
sunday
mornings
when
the
church
bells
began
to
ring
he
would
turn
hastily
to
his
books
as
if
to
find
peace
in
them
knowledge
knowledge
could
it
stay
his
hunger
for
the
music
of
the
hymn
when
he
had
first
started
work
at
the
shops
he
had
often
and
often
stood
before
some
miracle
now
he
was
gathering
the
power
to
work
miracles
himself
and
so
he
read
and
read
and
drank
in
all
that
he
could
draw
from
teacher
or
book
and
thought
and
thought
things
out
for
himself
fixed
lessons
and
set
tasks
were
all
well
enough
but
peer
was
for
ever
looking
farther
for
him
there
were
questions
and
more
questions
riddles
and
new
riddles
always
new
always
farther
and
farther
on
towards
the
unknown
he
had
made
as
yet
but
one
step
forward
in
physics
mathematics
chemistry
he
divined
that
there
were
worlds
still
before
him
and
he
must
hasten
on
on
on
would
the
day
ever
come
when
he
should
reach
the
end
what
is
knowledge
what
use
do
men
make
of
all
that
they
have
learned
look
at
the
teachers
who
knew
so
much
were
they
greater
richer
brighter
beings
than
the
rest
could
much
study
bring
a
man
so
far
that
some
night
he
could
lift
up
a
finger
and
make
the
stars
themselves
break
into
song
best
drive
ahead
at
any
rate
but
again
could
knowledge
lead
on
to
that
ecstasy
of
the
sunday
psalm
that
makes
all
riddles
clear
that
bears
a
man
upwards
in
nameless
happiness
in
which
his
soul
expands
till
it
can
enfold
the
infinite
spaces
well
at
any
rate
the
best
thing
was
to
drive
ahead
drive
ahead
both
early
and
late
one
day
that
spring
when
the
trees
in
the
city
avenues
were
beginning
to
bud
klaus
brock
and
ferdinand
holm
were
sitting
in
a
cafe
in
north
street
there
goes
your
friend
said
ferdinand
and
looking
from
the
window
they
saw
peer
holm
passing
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
his
clothes
were
shabby
his
shoes
had
not
been
cleaned
he
walked
slowly
his
fair
head
with
its
college
cap
bent
forward
but
seemed
nevertheless
to
notice
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
street
wonder
what
he
s
going
pondering
over
now
said
klaus
look
there
i
suppose
that
s
a
type
of
carriage
he
s
never
seen
before
why
he
has
got
the
driver
to
stop
i
wouldn
t
mind
betting
he
ll
crawl
in
between
the
wheels
to
find
out
whatever
he
s
after
laughed
klaus
drawing
back
from
the
window
so
as
not
to
be
seen
he
looks
pale
and
fagged
out
said
ferdinand
shifting
his
glasses
i
suppose
his
people
aren
t
very
well
off
klaus
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
the
other
he
s
not
overburdened
with
cash
i
they
drank
off
their
beer
and
sat
smoking
and
talking
of
other
things
until
ferdinand
remarked
casually
by
the
way
about
your
friend
are
his
parents
still
alive
klaus
was
by
no
means
anxious
to
go
into
peer
s
family
affairs
and
answered
briefly
no
he
thought
not
i
m
afraid
i
m
boring
you
with
questions
but
the
fact
is
the
fellow
interests
me
rather
there
is
something
in
his
face
something
arresting
even
the
way
he
walks
where
is
it
i
ve
seen
some
one
walk
like
that
before
and
he
works
like
a
i
hear
works
repeated
klaus
he
ll
ruin
his
health
before
long
the
way
he
goes
on
grinding
i
believe
he
s
got
an
idea
that
by
much
learning
he
can
learn
at
last
to
to
do
what
why
to
understand
god
ferdinand
was
staring
out
of
the
window
funny
enough
he
said
i
ran
across
him
last
sunday
up
among
the
hills
he
was
out
studying
geology
if
you
please
and
if
there
s
a
lecture
anywhere
about
anything
whether
it
s
astronomy
or
a
french
poet
you
can
safely
swear
he
ll
be
sitting
there
taking
notes
you
can
t
compete
with
a
fellow
like
that
he
ll
run
across
a
new
name
somewhere
aristotle
for
instance
it
s
something
new
and
off
he
must
go
to
the
library
to
look
it
up
and
then
he
ll
lie
awake
for
nights
after
stuffing
his
head
with
translations
from
the
greek
how
the
deuce
can
any
one
keep
up
with
a
man
who
goes
at
things
that
way
there
s
one
thing
though
that
he
knows
nothing
and
that
is
well
wine
and
women
we
ll
say
and
fun
in
general
one
thing
he
isn
t
by
jove
and
that
s
perhaps
he
s
not
been
able
to
afford
that
sort
of
thing
said
ferdinand
with
something
like
a
sigh
the
two
sat
on
for
some
time
and
every
now
and
then
when
klaus
was
off
his
guard
ferdinand
would
slip
in
another
little
question
about
peer
and
by
the
time
they
had
finished
their
second
glass
klaus
had
admitted
that
people
said
peer
s
mother
had
been
a
well
no
better
than
she
should
be
and
what
about
his
father
ferdinand
let
fall
casually
klaus
flushed
uncomfortably
at
this
nobody
no
nobody
knows
much
about
him
he
stammered
i
d
tell
you
if
i
knew
hanged
if
i
wouldn
t
no
one
has
an
idea
who
it
was
he
he
s
very
likely
in
you
re
always
mighty
mysterious
when
you
get
on
the
subject
of
his
family
i
ve
noticed
said
ferdinand
with
a
laugh
but
klaus
thought
his
companion
looked
a
little
pale
a
few
days
later
peer
was
sitting
alone
in
his
room
above
the
stables
when
he
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
the
door
opened
and
ferdinand
holm
walked
in
peer
rose
involuntarily
and
grasped
at
the
back
of
his
chair
as
if
to
steady
himself
if
this
young
coxcomb
had
come
from
the
schoolmaster
for
instance
or
to
take
away
his
name
why
he
d
just
throw
him
downstairs
that
was
all
i
thought
i
d
like
to
look
you
up
and
see
where
you
lived
began
the
visitor
laying
down
his
hat
and
taking
a
seat
i
ve
taken
you
unawares
i
see
sorry
to
disturb
you
but
the
fact
is
there
s
something
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
oh
is
there
and
peer
sat
down
as
far
as
conveniently
possible
from
the
other
i
ve
noticed
even
in
the
few
times
we
ve
happened
to
meet
that
you
don
t
like
me
well
you
know
that
s
a
thing
i
m
not
going
to
put
up
what
do
you
mean
asked
peer
hardly
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or
not
i
want
to
be
friends
with
you
that
s
all
you
probably
know
a
good
deal
more
about
me
than
i
do
about
you
but
that
need
not
matter
hullo
do
you
always
drum
with
your
fingers
on
the
table
like
that
why
that
was
a
habit
of
my
father
s
peer
stared
at
the
other
in
silence
but
his
fingers
stopped
drumming
i
rather
envy
you
you
know
living
as
you
do
when
you
come
to
be
a
millionaire
you
ll
have
an
effective
background
for
your
millions
and
then
you
must
know
a
great
deal
more
about
life
than
we
do
and
the
knowledge
that
comes
out
of
books
must
have
quite
another
spiritual
value
for
you
than
for
the
rest
of
us
who
ve
been
stuffed
mechanically
with
lessons
and
education
and
so
forth
since
we
were
kids
and
now
you
re
going
in
for
engineering
yes
said
peer
his
face
added
pretty
clearly
and
what
concern
is
it
of
yours
well
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
modern
technician
is
a
priest
in
his
way
or
no
perhaps
i
should
rather
call
him
a
descendant
of
old
prometheus
quite
a
respectable
ancestry
too
don
t
you
think
but
has
it
ever
struck
you
that
with
every
victory
over
nature
won
by
the
human
spirit
a
fragment
of
their
omnipotence
is
wrested
from
the
hands
of
the
gods
i
always
feel
as
if
we
were
using
fire
and
steel
mechanical
energy
and
human
thought
as
weapons
of
revolt
against
the
heavenly
tyranny
the
day
will
come
when
we
shall
no
longer
need
to
pray
the
hour
will
strike
when
the
heavenly
potentates
will
be
forced
to
capitulate
and
in
their
turn
bend
the
knee
to
us
what
do
you
think
yourself
jehovah
doesn
t
like
engineers
that
s
my
sounds
very
well
said
peer
briefly
but
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
the
other
had
put
into
words
something
that
had
been
struggling
for
expression
in
his
own
mind
of
course
for
the
present
we
two
must
be
content
with
smaller
things
ferdinand
went
on
and
i
don
t
mind
admitting
that
laying
out
a
bit
of
road
or
a
bit
of
railway
or
bridging
a
ditch
or
so
isn
t
work
that
appeals
to
me
tremendously
but
if
a
man
can
get
out
into
the
wide
world
there
are
things
enough
to
be
done
that
give
him
plenty
of
chance
to
develop
what
s
in
him
if
there
happens
to
be
anything
i
used
to
envy
the
great
soldiers
who
went
about
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
conquering
wild
tribes
and
founding
empires
organising
and
civilising
where
they
went
but
in
our
day
an
engineer
can
find
big
jobs
too
once
he
gets
out
in
the
world
draining
thousands
of
square
miles
of
swamp
or
regulating
the
nile
or
linking
two
oceans
together
that
s
the
sort
of
thing
i
m
going
to
take
a
hand
in
some
day
as
soon
as
i
ve
finished
here
i
m
off
and
we
ll
leave
it
to
the
engineers
to
come
say
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years
or
so
to
start
in
arranging
tourist
routes
between
the
stars
do
you
mind
my
smoking
no
please
do
said
peer
but
i
m
sorry
i
haven
t
i
have
thanks
all
the
ferdinand
took
out
his
and
when
peer
had
declined
the
offered
cigar
lit
one
himself
look
here
he
said
won
t
you
come
out
and
have
dinner
with
me
somewhere
peer
started
at
his
visitor
what
did
all
this
mean
i
m
a
regular
spartan
as
a
rule
but
they
ve
just
finished
dividing
up
my
father
s
estate
so
i
m
in
funds
for
the
moment
and
why
shouldn
t
we
have
a
little
dinner
to
celebrate
if
you
want
to
change
i
can
wait
outside
but
come
just
as
you
are
of
course
if
you
peer
was
more
and
more
perplexed
was
there
something
behind
all
this
or
was
the
fellow
simply
an
astonishingly
good
sort
giving
it
up
at
last
he
changed
his
collar
and
put
on
his
best
suit
and
went
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
found
himself
in
a
restaurant
with
small
tables
covered
with
tablecloths
flowers
in
vases
napkins
folded
shape
bowls
and
coloured
ferdinand
seemed
thoroughly
at
home
and
treated
his
companion
with
a
friendly
politeness
and
during
the
meal
he
managed
to
make
the
talk
turn
most
of
the
time
on
peer
s
childhood
and
early
days
when
they
had
come
to
the
coffee
and
cigars
ferdinand
leaned
across
the
table
towards
him
and
said
look
here
don
t
you
think
we
two
ought
to
say
thee
and
to
each
other
tutoyer
the
mode
of
address
of
intimate
friendship
or
relationship
oh
yes
said
peer
really
touched
now
we
re
both
holms
you
yes
so
we
and
after
all
who
knows
that
there
mayn
t
be
some
sort
of
connection
come
now
don
t
look
like
that
i
only
want
you
to
look
on
me
as
your
good
friend
and
to
come
to
me
if
ever
there
s
anything
i
can
do
we
needn
t
live
in
each
other
s
pockets
of
course
when
other
people
are
by
but
we
must
take
in
klaus
brock
along
with
us
don
t
you
think
peer
felt
a
strong
impulse
to
run
away
did
the
other
know
everything
if
so
why
didn
t
he
speak
straight
out
as
the
two
walked
home
in
the
clear
light
of
the
spring
evening
ferdinand
took
his
companion
s
arm
and
said
i
don
t
know
if
you
ve
heard
that
i
m
not
on
good
terms
with
my
people
at
home
but
the
very
first
time
i
saw
you
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
we
two
belonged
together
somehow
you
seemed
to
remind
me
so
of
well
to
tell
the
truth
of
my
father
and
he
let
me
tell
you
was
a
gallant
gentleman
peer
did
not
answer
and
the
matter
went
no
farther
then
but
the
next
few
days
were
an
exciting
time
for
peer
he
could
not
quite
make
out
how
much
ferdinand
knew
and
nothing
on
earth
would
have
induced
him
to
say
anything
more
himself
and
the
other
asked
no
questions
but
was
just
a
comrade
behaving
as
if
they
had
been
friends
for
years
he
did
not
even
ask
peer
any
more
about
his
childhood
and
never
again
referred
to
his
own
family
peer
was
always
reminding
himself
to
be
on
his
guard
but
could
not
help
feeling
glad
all
the
same
whenever
they
were
to
meet
he
was
invited
one
evening
with
klaus
to
a
at
ferdinand
s
lodging
and
found
himself
in
a
handsomely
furnished
room
with
pictures
on
the
walls
and
photographs
of
his
host
s
parents
there
was
one
of
his
father
as
a
young
man
in
uniform
another
of
his
grandfather
who
had
been
a
judge
of
the
supreme
court
it
s
very
good
of
you
to
be
so
interested
in
my
people
said
ferdinand
with
a
smile
klaus
brock
looked
from
one
to
the
other
wondering
to
himself
how
things
really
stood
between
the
two
the
summer
vacation
came
round
and
the
students
prepared
to
break
up
and
go
their
various
ways
klaus
was
to
go
home
and
one
day
ferdinand
came
to
peer
and
said
look
here
old
man
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
great
favour
i
d
arranged
to
go
to
the
seaside
this
summer
but
i
ve
a
chance
of
going
up
to
the
hills
too
well
i
can
t
be
in
two
places
at
once
couldn
t
you
take
on
one
of
them
for
me
of
course
i
d
pay
all
no
thank
you
said
peer
with
a
laugh
but
when
klaus
brock
came
just
before
leaving
and
said
see
here
peer
don
t
you
think
you
and
i
might
club
together
and
put
a
marble
slab
over
louise
s
grave
peer
was
touched
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
what
a
good
old
fellow
you
are
klaus
he
said
later
in
the
summer
peer
set
out
alone
on
a
tramp
through
the
country
and
whenever
he
saw
a
chance
he
would
go
up
to
one
of
the
farms
and
say
would
you
like
to
have
a
good
map
of
the
farm
it
ll
cost
ten
crowns
and
my
lodging
while
i
m
at
it
made
a
very
pleasant
holiday
for
him
and
he
came
home
with
a
little
money
in
his
pocket
to
boot
his
second
year
at
the
school
was
much
like
the
first
he
plodded
along
at
his
work
and
now
and
then
his
two
friends
would
come
and
drag
him
off
for
an
evening
s
jollification
but
after
he
had
been
racketing
about
with
the
others
singing
and
shouting
through
the
sleeping
town
and
at
last
was
alone
and
in
his
bed
in
the
darkness
another
and
a
very
different
life
began
for
him
face
to
face
with
his
innermost
self
where
are
you
heading
for
peer
what
are
you
aiming
at
in
all
your
labours
and
he
would
try
to
answer
devoutly
as
at
evening
prayers
where
why
of
course
i
am
going
to
be
a
great
engineer
and
then
i
will
be
one
of
the
sons
of
prometheus
that
head
the
revolt
against
the
tyranny
of
heaven
and
then
i
will
help
to
raise
the
great
ladder
on
which
men
can
climb
aloft
higher
and
higher
up
towards
the
light
and
the
spirit
and
mastery
over
nature
and
then
live
happily
marry
and
have
children
and
a
rich
and
beautiful
home
and
then
oh
well
one
fine
day
of
course
one
must
grow
old
and
die
and
then
and
then
aye
what
then
at
these
times
he
found
a
shadowy
comfort
in
taking
refuge
in
the
world
where
louise
stood
playing
as
he
always
saw
her
and
cradling
himself
on
the
smooth
red
billows
of
her
music
but
why
was
it
that
here
most
of
all
he
felt
that
hunger
for
for
something
more
ferdinand
finished
his
college
course
and
went
out
as
he
had
said
into
the
great
world
and
klaus
went
with
him
and
so
throughout
his
third
year
peer
was
mostly
to
be
seen
alone
always
with
books
under
his
arm
and
head
bent
forward
just
as
he
was
getting
ready
to
go
up
for
his
final
examination
a
letter
from
ferdinand
arrived
written
from
egypt
come
over
here
young
fellow
he
wrote

have
got

billets

last

but
peer
did
not
go
at
once
he
stayed
on
another
year
at
the
college
as
assistant
to
the
lecturer
on
mechanics
while
himself
going
through
the
road
and
railway
construction
course
as
his
had
done
some
secret
instinct
urged
him
not
to
be
left
behind
even
in
this
as
the
year
went
on
the
letters
from
his
two
comrades
became
more
and
more
pressing
and

you
re
bound
to
take
a
hand
in
that
my
boy
there
s
work
worthy
of
a
great
general
waiting
for
you
at
last
one
autumn
day
when
the
woods
stood
yellow
all
around
the
town
peer
drove
away
from
his
home
with
a
big
new
strapped
to
the
driver
s
seat
he
had
been
up
to
the
churchyard
before
starting
with
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
for
louise
s
grave
who
could
say
if
he
would
ever
see
it
again
at
the
station
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
back
over
the
old
city
with
its
cathedral
and
the
ancient
fortress
where
the
sentry
was
pacing
back
and
forth
against
the
skyline
was
this
the
end
of
his
youth
louise
the
room
above
the
stables
the
hospital
the
lazarette
the
college
and
there
lay
the
fjord
and
far
out
somewhere
on
the
coast
there
stood
no
doubt
a
little
grey
where
a
goodwife
and
her
goodman
had
perhaps
even
now
received
the
parcel
of
coffee
and
tobacco
sent
them
as
a
parting
gift
and
so
peer
journeyed
to
the
capital
and
from
there

into

i
some
years
had
passed
a
good
many
years
and
once
more
summer
had
come
and
june
a
passenger
steamer
bound
from
antwerp
to
christiania
was
ploughing
her
way
one
evening
over
a
sea
so
motionlessly
calm
that
it
seemed
a
single
vast
mirror
filled
with
a
sky
of
grey
and
clouds
there
were
plenty
of
passengers
on
board
and
no
one
felt
inclined
for
bed
it
was
so
warm
so
beautiful
on
deck
some
artists
on
their
way
home
from
paris
or
munich
cast
about
for
amusements
to
pass
the
time
some
ordered
wine
others
had
unearthed
a
concertina
and
very
soon
no
one
knew
how
a
dance
was
in
full
swing
no
my
dear
said
one
or
two
cautious
mothers
to
their
girls
certainly
but
before
long
the
mothers
were
dancing
themselves
then
there
was
a
doctor
in
spectacles
who
stood
up
on
a
barrel
and
made
a
speech
and
presently
two
of
the
artists
caught
hold
of
the
captain
and
chaired
him
round
the
deck
the
night
was
so
clear
the
skies
so
ruddily
beautiful
the
air
so
soft
and
out
here
on
the
open
sea
all
hearts
were
light
and
happy
who
s
that
beggar
over
there
that
s
too
high
and
mighty
for
a
little
fun
asked
storaker
the
painter
of
his
friend
the
sculptor
praas
that
fellow
oh
he
s
the
one
that
was
so
infernally
instructive
at
dinner
when
we
were
talking
about
egyptian
so
it
is
by
jove
schoolmaster
abroad
i
should
think
when
we
got
on
to
athens
and
greek
sculpture
he
condescended
to
set
us
right
about
that
i
heard
him
this
morning
holding
forth
to
the
doctor
on
assyriology
no
wonder
he
doesn
t
dance
the
passenger
they
were
speaking
of
was
a
man
of
middle
height
between
thirty
and
forty
apparently
who
lay
stretched
in
a
a
little
way
off
he
was
dressed
in
grey
throughout
from
his
to
the
spats
above
his
brown
shoes
his
face
was
sallow
and
the
short
brown
beard
was
flecked
with
grey
but
his
eyes
had
gay
little
gleams
in
them
as
they
followed
the
dancers
it
was
peer
holm
as
he
sat
there
watching
it
annoyed
him
to
feel
that
he
could
not
let
himself
go
like
the
others
but
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
mixed
with
his
own
countrymen
that
he
felt
insecure
of
his
footing
and
almost
like
a
foreigner
among
them
besides
in
a
few
hours
now
they
should
sight
the
skerries
on
the
norwegian
coast
and
the
thought
awoke
in
him
a
strange
excitement
it
was
a
moment
he
had
dreamed
of
many
and
many
a
time
out
there
in
the
wide
world
after
a
while
stillness
fell
on
the
decks
around
him
and
he
too
went
below
but
lay
down
in
his
cabin
without
undressing
he
thought
of
the
time
when
he
had
passed
that
way
on
the
outward
voyage
poor
and
unknown
and
had
watched
the
last
island
of
his
native
land
sink
below
the
much
had
happened
since
then
and
now
that
he
had
at
last
come
home
what
life
awaited
him
there
a
little
after
two
in
the
morning
he
came
on
deck
again
but
stood
still
in
astonishment
at
finding
that
the
vessel
was
now
boring
her
way
through
a
thick
woolly
fog
the
devil
thought
he
beginning
to
tramp
up
and
down
the
deck
impatiently
it
seemed
that
his
great
moment
was
to
be
lost
spoiled
for
him
but
suddenly
he
stopped
by
the
railing
and
stood
gazing
out
into
the
east
what
was
that
far
out
in
the
depths
of
the
woolly
fog
a
glowing
spot
appeared
the
grey
mass
around
grew
alive
began
to
move
to
redden
to
thin
out
as
if
it
were
streaming
up
in
flames
ah
now
he
knew
it
was
the
globe
of
the
sun
rising
out
of
the
sea
on
board
every
point
where
the
night
s
moisture
had
lodged
began
to
shine
in
gold
each
moment
it
grew
clearer
and
lighter
and
the
eye
reached
farther
and
before
he
could
take
in
what
was
happening
the
grey
darkness
had
rolled
itself
up
into
mounds
into
mountains
that
grew
buoyant
and
floated
aloft
and
melted
away
and
there
all
revealed
lay
the
fresh
bright
morning
with
a
clear
sky
over
the
blue
sea
it
was
time
now
to
get
out
his
for
a
long
time
he
stood
motionless
gazing
intently
through
them
there
was
it
his
fancy
no
there
far
ahead
he
can
see
clearly
now
a
darker
strip
between
sky
and
sea
it
s
the
first
skerry
it
is
norway
at
last
peer
felt
a
sudden
catch
in
his
breath
he
could
hardly
stand
still
but
he
stopped
again
and
again
in
his
walk
to
look
once
more
at
the
strip
of
grey
and
now
there
were
seabirds
too
with
long
necks
and
wings
welcome
home
and
now
the
steamer
is
ploughing
in
among
the
skerries
and
a
world
of
rocks
and
islets
unfolds
on
every
side
there
is
the
first
red
and
then
the
entrance
to
christiansand
between
wooded
hills
and
islands
where
white
cottages
shine
out
each
with
its
patch
of
green
grassland
and
its
flagstaff
before
it
peer
watched
it
all
drinking
it
in
like
nourishment
how
good
it
all
tasted
he
felt
it
would
be
long
before
he
had
drunk
his
fill
then
came
the
voyage
up
along
the
coast
all
through
a
day
of
brilliant
sunshine
and
a
luminous
night
he
saw
the
blue
sounds
with
swarms
of
white
gulls
hovering
above
them
the
little
with
their
long
wooden
houses
and
flowers
in
the
windows
he
had
never
passed
this
way
before
and
yet
something
in
him
seemed
to
nod
and
say
i
know
myself
again
all
the
way
up
the
christiania
fjord
there
was
the
scent
of
leaves
and
meadows
big
farms
stood
by
the
shore
shining
in
the
sun
this
was
what
a
great
farm
looked
like
he
nodded
again
so
warm
and
fruitful
it
all
seemed
and
dear
to
him
as
home
though
he
knew
that
after
all
he
would
be
little
better
than
a
tourist
in
his
own
country
there
was
no
one
waiting
for
him
no
one
to
take
him
in
still
some
day
things
might
be
very
different
as
the
ship
drew
alongside
the
quay
at
christiania
the
other
passengers
lined
the
rail
friends
and
relations
came
aboard
there
were
tears
and
laughter
and
kisses
and
embraces
peer
lifted
his
hat
as
he
passed
down
the
gangway
but
no
one
had
time
to
notice
him
just
now
and
when
he
had
found
a
hotel
porter
to
look
after
his
luggage
he
walked
up
alone
through
the
town
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
the
light
nights
made
it
difficult
to
sleep
he
had
actually
forgotten
that
it
was
light
all
night
long
and
this
was
a
capital
city
yet
so
touchingly
small
it
seemed
but
a
few
steps
wherever
he
went
these
were
his
countrymen
but
he
knew
no
one
among
them
there
was
no
one
to
greet
him
still
he
thought
again
some
day
all
this
might
be
very
different
at
last
one
day
as
he
stood
looking
at
the
window
of
a
bookseller
s
shop
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
why
bless
me
surely
it
s
peer
holm
it
was
one
of
his
at
the
technical
college
reidar
langberg
pale
and
thin
now
as
ever
he
had
been
a
shining
light
at
the
college
but
now
now
he
looked
shabby
worn
and
aged
i
hardly
knew
you
again
said
peer
grasping
the
other
s
hand
and
you
re
a
millionaire
so
they
say
and
famous
out
in
the
big
world
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
old
fellow
but
what
about
you
i
oh
don
t
talk
about
and
as
they
walked
down
the
street
together
langberg
poured
out
his
tale
of
how
times
were
desperately
bad
and
conditions
at
home
here
simply
strangled
a
man
he
had
started
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
as
a
draughtsman
in
the
offices
of
the
state
railways
and
was
still
there
with
a
growing
family
and
such
pay
such
pay
my
dear
fellow
he
threw
up
his
eyes
and
clasped
his
hands
despairingly
look
here
said
peer
interrupting
him
where
is
the
best
place
in
christiania
to
go
and
have
a
good
time
in
the
evening
well
hans
hill
for
instance
there
s
music
right
will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
there
shall
we
say
eight
o
clock
thanks
i
should
think
i
would
peer
arrived
in
good
time
and
engaged
a
table
on
a
verandah
langberg
made
his
appearance
shortly
after
dressed
in
his
sunday
best
faded
light
trousers
bagged
at
the
knees
and
a
straw
hat
yellow
with
age
it
s
a
pleasure
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
again
said
peer
for
the
last
year
or
so
i
ve
been
knocking
about
pretty
much
by
is
it
as
long
as
that
since
you
left
egypt
yes
longer
i
ve
been
in
abyssinia
since
oh
of
course
i
remember
now
it
was
in
the
papers
building
a
railway
for
king
menelik
weren
t
you
oh
yes
but
the
last
eighteen
months
or
so
i
ve
been
idling
running
about
to
theatres
and
museums
and
so
forth
i
began
at
athens
and
finished
up
with
london
i
remember
one
day
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
parthenon
declaiming
the
antigone
and
a
moment
with
some
meaning
in
it
seemed
to
have
come
at
but
dash
it
man
you
re
surely
not
comparing
such
trifles
with
a
thing
like
the
great
nile
barrage
you
were
on
that
for
some
years
weren
t
you
do
let
s
hear
something
about
that
up
by
the
first
cataract
wasn
t
it
and
hadn
t
you
enormous
quarries
there
on
the
spot
you
see
even
sitting
at
home
here
i
haven
t
quite
lost
touch
but
you
good
lord
what
things
you
must
have
seen
fancy
living
at
what
was
the
name
of
the
town
again
assuan
answered
peer
indifferently
looking
out
over
the
gardens
where
more
and
more
visitors
kept
arriving
they
say
the
barrage
is
as
great
a
miracle
as
the
pyramids
how
many
are
there
again
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
and
sixteen
said
peer
look
he
broke
off
do
you
know
those
girls
over
there
he
nodded
towards
a
party
of
girls
in
light
dresses
who
were
sitting
down
at
a
table
close
by
langberg
shook
his
head
he
was
greedy
for
news
from
the
great
world
without
which
he
had
never
had
the
luck
to
see
i
ve
often
wondered
he
went
on
how
you
managed
to
come
to
the
front
so
in
that
sort
of
work
railways
and
barrages
and
so
forth
when
your
original
line
was
mechanical
engineering
of
course
you
did
do
an
extra
year
on
the
roads
and
railway
side
but
oh
this
shining
light
of
the
schools
what
do
you
say
to
a
glass
of
champagne
said
peer
how
do
you
like
it
sweet
or
dry
why
is
there
any
difference
i
really
didn
t
know
but
when
one
s
a
millionaire
of
course
i
m
not
a
millionaire
said
peer
with
a
smile
and
beckoned
to
a
waiter
oh
i
heard
you
were
didn
t
you
invent
a
new
that
drove
all
the
other
types
out
of
the
field
and
besides
that
abyssinian
railway
oh
well
well
he
sighed
it
s
a
good
thing
somebody
s
lucky
the
rest
of
us
shouldn
t
complain
but
how
about
the
other
two
klaus
brock
and
ferdinand
holm
what
are
they
doing
now
klaus
is
looking
after
the
khedive
s
estates
at
edfina
agriculture
by
steam
power
his
own
railway
lines
to
bring
in
the
produce
and
so
on
yes
klaus
has
ended
up
in
a
nice
little
place
of
his
own
his
district
s
bigger
than
the
kingdom
of
good
heavens
langberg
nearly
fell
off
his
chair
and
ferdinand
holm
what
about
him
oh
he
s
got
bigger
things
on
hand
went
nosing
about
the
libyan
desert
and
found
that
considerable
tracts
of
it
have
only
a
few
yards
beneath
the
surface
if
so
of
course
it
s
only
a
question
of
proper
plant
to
turn
an
enormous
area
into
a
paradise
for
good
gracious
what
a
discovery
gasped
the
other
almost
breathless
now
peer
looked
out
over
the
fjord
and
went
on
last
year
he
managed
at
last
to
get
the
khedive
interested
and
they
ve
started
a
company
now
with
a
capital
of
some
millions
ferdinand
is
chief
and
what
s
his
salary
as
much
as
fifty
thousand
crowns
his
pay
is
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
said
peer
not
without
some
fear
that
his
companion
might
faint
yes
he
s
an
able
fellow
is
it
took
langberg
some
time
to
get
his
breath
again
at
last
he
asked
with
a
sidelong
glance
and
you
and
klaus
brock
i
suppose
you
ve
put
your
millions
in
his
company
peer
smiled
as
he
sat
looking
out
over
the
garden
lifting
his
glass
your
good
health
he
said
for
all
answer
have
you
been
in
america
too
went
on
the
other
no
i
suppose
not
america
yes
a
few
years
back
when
i
was
with
brown
they
sent
me
over
one
time
to
buy
plant
nothing
so
surprising
in
that
is
there
no
no
of
course
not
i
was
only
thinking
you
went
about
there
i
daresay
and
saw
all
the
wonderful
things
the
miracles
of
science
they
re
always
my
dear
fellow
if
you
only
knew
how
deadly
sick
i
am
of
miracles
of
science
what
i
m
longing
for
is
a
country
watermill
that
takes
hours
to
grind
a
sack
of
what
what
do
you
say
langberg
bounced
in
his
chair
you
re
the
same
old
man
i
can
i
m
perfectly
serious
said
peer
lifting
his
glass
towards
the
other
come
here
s
to
our
old
days
together
aye
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
to
our
old
days
together
ah
delicious
well
then
i
suppose
you
ve
fallen
in
love
away
down
there
in
the
land
of
the
barbarians
haven
t
you
do
you
call
egypt
a
land
of
barbarians
well
don
t
the
fellahs
still
yoke
their
wives
to
their
ploughs
a
fellah
will
sit
all
night
long
outside
his
hut
and
gaze
up
at
the
stars
and
give
himself
time
to
dream
and
a
merchant
prince
in
vienna
will
dictate
business
letters
in
his
automobile
as
he
s
driving
to
the
theatre
and
write
telegrams
as
he
sits
in
the
stalls
one
fine
day
he
ll
be
sitting
in
his
private
box
with
a
telephone
at
one
ear
and
listening
to
the
opera
with
the
other
that
s
what
the
miracles
of
science
are
doing
for
us
isn
t
it
and
you
talk
like
that
a
man
that
s
helped
to
harness
the
nile
and
has
built
railways
through
the
desert
peer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
offered
the
other
a
cigar
from
his
case
a
waiter
appeared
with
coffee
to
help
mankind
to
make
quicker
progress
is
that
nothing
lord
what
i
d
like
to
know
is
where
mankind
are
making
for
that
they
re
in
such
a
that
the
nile
barrage
has
doubled
the
production
of
corn
in
egypt
created
the
possibilities
of
life
for
millions
of
human
beings
is
that
nothing
my
good
fellow
do
you
really
think
there
aren
t
enough
fools
on
this
earth
already
have
we
too
little
wailing
and
misery
and
discontent
and
as
it
is
why
must
we
go
about
to
double
it
but
hang
it
all
man
what
about
european
culture
surely
you
felt
yourself
a
sort
of
missionary
of
civilisation
where
you
have
the
spread
of
european
civilisation
in
the
east
simply
means
that
half
a
dozen
big
financiers
in
london
or
paris
take
a
fancy
to
a
certain
strip
of
africa
or
asia
they
press
a
button
and
out
come
all
the
ministers
and
generals
and
missionaries
and
engineers
with
a
bow
at
your
service
gentlemen
culture
one
wheel
begets
ten
new
ones
and
the
ten
again
another
hundred
more
speed
more
competition
and
all
for
what
for
culture
no
my
friend
for
money
missionary
i
tell
you
as
long
as
western
europe
with
all
its
wonders
of
modern
science
and
its
christianity
and
its
political
reforms
hasn
t
turned
out
a
better
type
of
humanity
than
the
mean
ruck
of
men
we
have
now
we
d
do
best
to
stay
at
home
and
hold
our
counfounded
jaw
here
s
ourselves
and
peer
emptied
his
glass
this
was
a
sad
hearing
for
poor
langberg
for
he
had
been
used
to
comfort
himself
in
his
daily
round
with
the
thought
that
even
he
in
his
modest
sphere
was
doing
his
share
in
the
great
work
of
civilising
the
world
at
last
he
leaned
back
watching
the
smoke
from
his
cigar
and
smiling
a
little
i
remember
a
young
fellow
at
the
college
he
said
who
used
to
talk
a
good
deal
about
prometheus
and
the
grand
work
of
liberating
humanity
by
stealing
new
and
ever
new
fire
from
that
was
me
yes
said
peer
with
a
laugh
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
only
quoting
ferdinand
you
don
t
believe
in
all
that
now
it
strikes
me
that
fire
and
steel
are
rapidly
turning
men
into
beasts
machinery
is
killing
more
and
more
of
what
we
call
the
godlike
in
but
good
heavens
man
surely
a
man
can
be
a
christian
even
if
christian
as
much
as
you
like
but
don
t
you
think
it
might
soon
be
time
we
found
something
better
to
worship
than
an
ascetic
on
a
cross
are
we
to
keep
on
for
ever
singing
hallelujah
because
we
ve
saved
our
own
skins
and
yet
can
haggle
ourselves
into
heaven
is
that
religion
no
no
perhaps
not
but
i
don
t
know
neither
do
i
but
it
s
all
the
same
for
anyhow
no
such
thing
as
religious
feeling
exists
any
longer
machinery
is
killing
our
longings
for
eternity
too
ask
the
good
people
in
the
great
cities
they
spend
christmas
eve
playing
tunes
from
the
dollar
princess
on
the
langberg
sat
for
a
while
watching
the
other
attentively
peer
sat
smoking
slowly
his
face
was
flushed
with
the
wine
but
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
and
his
thoughts
seemed
to
be
wandering
in
other
fields
than
these
and
what
do
you
think
of
doing
now
you
are
home
again
asked
his
companion
at
last
peer
opened
his
eyes
doing
oh
i
don
t
know
look
about
me
first
of
all
then
perhaps
i
may
find
a
cottar
s
croft
somewhere
and
settle
down
and
marry
a
dairymaid
here
s
luck
the
gardens
were
full
now
of
people
in
light
summer
dress
and
in
the
luminous
evening
a
constant
ripple
of
laughter
and
gay
voices
came
up
to
them
peer
looked
curiously
at
the
crowd
all
strangers
to
him
and
asked
his
companion
the
names
of
some
of
the
people
langberg
pointed
out
one
or
two
celebrities
a
cabinet
minister
sitting
near
by
a
famous
explorer
a
little
farther
off
but
i
don
t
know
them
personally
he
added
can
t
afford
society
on
that
scale
of
how
beautiful
it
is
here
said
peer
looking
out
once
more
at
the
yellow
shimmer
of
light
above
the
fjord
and
how
good
it
is
to
be
home
again
chapter
ii
he
sat
in
the
train
on
his
way
and
from
the
carriage
window
watched
farms
and
meadows
and
roads
slide
past
where
was
he
going
he
did
not
know
himself
why
should
not
a
man
start
off
at
haphazard
and
get
out
when
the
mood
takes
him
at
last
he
was
able
to
travel
through
his
own
country
without
having
to
think
of
he
could
let
the
days
pass
over
his
head
without
care
or
trouble
and
give
himself
good
leisure
to
enjoy
any
beauty
that
came
in
his
way
there
is
mjosen
the
broad
lake
with
the
rich
farmlands
and
long
wooded
ridges
on
either
side
he
had
never
been
here
before
yet
it
seemed
as
if
something
in
him
nodded
a
recognition
to
it
all
once
more
he
sat
drinking
in
the
rich
fruitful
landscape
the
wooded
hills
the
fields
and
meadows
seemed
to
spread
themselves
out
over
empty
places
in
his
mind
but
later
in
the
day
the
landscape
narrowed
and
they
were
in
gudbrandsdalen
where
the
sunburned
farms
are
set
on
green
slopes
between
the
river
and
the
mountains
peer
s
head
was
full
of
pictures
from
abroad
from
the
desert
sands
with
their
scorched
to
the
canals
of
venice
but
here
he
nodded
again
here
he
was
at
home
though
he
had
never
seen
the
place
before
just
this
it
was
which
had
been
calling
to
him
all
through
his
long
years
of
exile
at
last
on
a
sudden
he
gathered
up
his
traps
and
got
out
without
the
least
idea
even
of
the
name
of
the
station
a
meal
at
the
hotel
a
knapsack
on
his
back
and
hey
there
before
him
lies
the
road
up
into
the
hills
alone
what
matter
when
there
are
endless
things
that
greet
him
from
every
side
with
welcome
home
the
road
is
steep
the
air
grows
lighter
the
homesteads
smaller
at
last
the
huts
look
like
little
matchboxes
from
the
valley
no
doubt
it
must
seem
as
if
the
people
up
here
were
living
among
the
clouds
but
many
and
many
a
youth
must
have
followed
this
road
in
the
evenings
going
up
to
court
his
mari
or
his
kari
at
the
the
same
road
and
the
same
errand
one
generation
after
another
to
peer
it
seemed
as
if
all
those
lads
now
bore
him
company
aye
as
if
he
discovered
in
himself
something
of
wanton
youth
that
had
managed
to
get
free
at
last
puh
his
coat
must
come
off
and
his
cap
go
into
the
knapsack
now
as
the
valley
sinks
and
sinks
farther
beneath
him
the
view
across
it
widens
farther
and
farther
out
over
the
uplands
beyond
brown
hills
and
blue
ridges
livid
or
in
the
setting
sun
rising
and
falling
wave
behind
wave
and
beyond
all
a
great
snowfield
like
a
sea
of
white
breakers
foaming
against
the
sky
but
surely
he
had
seen
all
this
before
ah
now
he
knew
it
was
the
lofoten
sea
over
again
with
its
white
combers
and
swell
a
rolling
ocean
turned
to
rock
peer
halted
a
moment
leaning
on
his
stick
and
his
eyes
could
he
not
feel
that
same
rising
and
sinking
in
his
own
being
did
not
the
same
waves
surge
through
the
centuries
carrying
the
generations
away
with
them
upon
great
wanderings
and
in
daily
life
the
wave
rolls
us
along
in
the
old
familiar
rhythm
and
not
one
in
ten
thousand
lifts
his
head
above
it
to
ask
whither
and
why
even
now
just
such
a
little
wave
has
hold
of
him
taking
him
whither
and
why
well
the
coming
days
might
show
meanwhile
there
beyond
was
the
sea
of
stone
rolling
its
eternal
cadence
under
the
endless
sky
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
turned
and
went
his
way
but
what
is
that
far
off
in
the
three
sisters
in
white
shawls
lifting
their
heads
to
heaven
that
must
be
rondane
and
see
how
the
evening
sun
is
kindling
the
white
peaks
to
purple
and
gold
puh
only
one
more
hill
now
and
here
is
the
top
at
last
and
there
ahead
lie
the
great
uplands
with
marsh
and
mound
and
gleaming
tarns
ah
what
a
relief
what
wonder
that
his
step
grows
lighter
and
quicker
before
he
knows
it
he
is
singing
aloud
in
mere
gaiety
of
heart
ah
dear
god
what
if
after
all
it
were
not
too
late
to
be
young
a
saeter
a
little
hut
standing
on
a
patch
of
green
with
fence
and
a
long
of
rough
planks
it
must
be
a
saeter
and
listen
isn
t
that
a
girl
singing
peer
slipped
softly
through
the
gate
and
stood
listening
against
the
wall
of
the
byre
shap
shap
shap
went
the
streams
of
milk
against
the
pail
it
must
be
a
fairy
sitting
milking
in
there
then
came
the
voice
oh
sunday
eve
oh
sunday
eve
ever
wast
thou
my
dearest
eve
shap
shap
shap
went
the
milk
once
more
in
the
pail
and
suddenly
peer
joined
in
oh
bright
oh
gentle
sunday
eve
wilt
ever
be
my
dearest
eve
the
milking
stopped
a
cowbell
tinkled
as
the
cow
turned
her
inquiring
face
and
a
girl
s
head
of
hair
was
thrust
out
of
the
doorway
soon
followed
by
the
girl
herself
slender
eighteen
fresh
and
smiling
good
evening
said
peer
stretching
out
his
hand
the
girl
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
cast
a
glance
at
her
own
clothes
as
women
will
when
they
see
a
man
who
takes
their
fancy
an
who
may
you
be
she
asked
can
you
cook
me
some
a
must
finish
milking
first
here
was
a
job
that
peer
could
help
with
he
took
off
his
knapsack
washed
his
hands
and
was
soon
seated
on
a
stool
in
the
close
sweet
air
of
the
shed
milking
busily
then
he
fetched
water
and
chopped
some
wood
for
the
fire
the
girl
gazing
at
him
all
the
time
no
doubt
wondering
who
this
crazy
person
could
be
when
the
porridge
stood
ready
on
the
table
he
insisted
on
her
sitting
down
close
to
him
and
sharing
the
meal
they
ate
a
little
and
then
laughed
a
little
and
then
chatted
and
then
ate
and
then
laughed
again
when
he
asked
what
he
had
to
pay
the
girl
said
whatever
you
like
and
he
gave
her
two
crowns
and
then
bent
her
head
back
and
kissed
her
lips
what
s
the
man
up
to
he
heard
her
gasp
behind
him
as
he
passed
out
when
he
had
gone
a
good
way
and
turned
to
look
back
there
she
was
in
the
doorway
shading
her
eyes
and
watching
him
whither
away
now
well
he
was
pretty
sure
to
reach
some
other
inhabited
place
before
night
this
he
felt
was
not
his
no
it
was
not
here
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
he
stood
by
the
shore
of
a
broad
mountain
lake
beneath
a
here
were
a
couple
of
saeters
and
across
the
lake
on
a
wooded
island
stood
a
small
frame
house
that
looked
like
some
city
people
s
summer
cottage
and
see
over
the
lake
that
still
mirrored
the
evening
red
a
boat
appeared
moving
towards
the
island
and
two
girls
sat
at
the
oars
singing
as
they
rowed
a
strange
feeling
came
over
him
here
here
he
would
stay
in
the
stood
an
enormously
fat
woman
with
a
rope
round
her
middle
evidently
ready
to
go
to
bed
could
she
put
him
up
for
the
night
why
yes
she
supposed
so
and
she
rolled
off
into
another
room
and
soon
he
was
lying
in
a
tiny
chamber
in
a
bed
with
a
mountainous
mattress
and
a
quilt
there
was
a
fresh
smell
from
the
juniper
twigs
strewed
about
the
floor
and
the
cheeses
which
stood
in
rows
all
round
the
walls
ah
he
had
slept
in
many
places
and
fashions
at
sea
in
a
lofoten
boat
on
the
swaying
back
of
a
camel
in
tents
out
in
the
moonlit
desert
and
in
palaces
of
the
arabian
nights
where
dwarfs
fanned
him
with
to
drive
away
the
heat
and
called
him
pasha
but
here
at
last
he
had
found
a
place
where
it
was
good
to
be
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
listening
to
the
murmur
of
a
little
stream
outside
in
the
light
summer
night
till
he
fell
asleep
late
in
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
he
was
awakened
by
the
entry
of
the
old
woman
with
coffee
then
a
plunge
into
the
water
of
the
mountain
lake
a
short
swim
and
back
to
find
grilled
trout
and
waffles
and
thick
cream
for
lunch
yes
said
the
old
woman
if
he
could
get
along
with
the
sort
of
victuals
she
could
cook
he
might
stay
here
a
few
days
and
welcome
the
bed
was
standing
there
empty
anyway
chapter
iii
so
peer
stays
on
and
goes
fishing
he
catches
little
but
time
goes
leisurely
here
and
the
summer
lies
soft
and
warm
over
the
brown
and
blue
hillsides
he
has
soon
learned
that
a
merchant
named
uthoug
from
ringeby
is
living
in
the
house
on
the
island
with
his
wife
and
daughter
and
what
of
it
often
he
would
lie
in
his
boat
smoking
his
pipe
and
giving
himself
up
to
quiet
dreams
that
came
and
passed
a
young
girl
in
a
white
boat
moving
over
red
waters
in
the
evening
a
secret
meeting
on
an
island
no
one
must
know
just
yet
would
it
ever
happen
to
him
ah
no
the
sun
goes
down
there
come
sounds
of
nearing
the
saeters
the
musical
cries
and
calls
of
the
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
the
mountains
stand
silent
in
the
distance
their
tops
grown
golden
the
stream
slides
rippling
by
murmuring
on
through
the
luminous
nights
then
at
last
came
the
day
of
all
days
he
had
gone
out
for
a
long
tramp
at
random
over
the
hills
making
his
way
by
compass
and
noting
landmarks
to
guide
him
back
here
was
a
marsh
covered
with
the
taste
brought
back
his
own
childhood
he
wandered
on
up
a
ridge
flecked
with
red
heather
and
what
was
that
ahead
smoke
he
made
towards
it
yes
it
was
smoke
a
ptarmigan
fluttered
out
in
front
of
him
with
a
brood
of
tiny
youngsters
at
her
heels
lord
what
a
shave
he
stopped
short
to
avoid
treading
on
them
the
smoke
meant
someone
near
possibly
a
camp
of
lapps
let
s
go
and
see
he
topped
the
last
mound
and
there
was
the
fire
just
below
two
girls
jumped
to
their
feet
there
was
a
bright
on
the
fire
and
on
the
ground
close
by
bread
and
butter
and
sandwiches
laid
out
on
a
paper
tablecloth
peer
stopped
short
in
surprise
the
girls
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
and
he
at
them
all
three
with
a
hesitating
smile
at
last
peer
lifted
his
hat
and
asked
the
way
to
rustad
saeter
it
took
them
some
time
to
explain
this
and
then
they
asked
him
the
time
he
told
them
exactly
to
the
minute
and
then
showed
them
his
watch
so
that
they
might
see
for
themselves
all
this
took
more
time
meanwhile
they
had
inspected
each
other
and
found
no
reason
to
part
company
just
yet
one
of
the
girls
was
tall
slender
of
figure
with
a
oval
face
and
dark
brown
hair
her
eyebrows
were
thick
and
met
above
the
nose
delightful
to
look
at
she
wore
a
blue
serge
dress
with
the
skirt
kilted
up
a
little
leaving
her
ankles
visible
the
other
was
a
blonde
smaller
of
stature
and
with
a
melancholy
face
though
she
smiled
constantly
oh
she
said
suddenly
have
you
a
by
any
chance
oh
yes
peer
was
just
moving
off
but
gladly
seized
the
opportunity
to
stay
a
while
we
ve
a
tin
of
sardines
here
and
nothing
to
open
it
with
said
the
dark
one
let
me
try
said
peer
as
luck
would
have
it
he
managed
to
cut
himself
a
little
and
the
two
girls
tumbled
over
each
other
to
tie
up
the
wound
it
ended
of
course
with
their
asking
him
to
join
their
my
name
is
merle
uthoug
said
the
dark
one
with
a
curtsy
oh
then
it
s
your
father
who
has
the
place
on
the
island
in
the
lake
my
name
s
only
mork
thea
mork
my
father
is
a
lawyer
and
we
have
a
little
cottage
farther
up
the
lake
said
the
blonde
peer
was
about
to
introduce
himself
when
the
dark
girl
interrupted
oh
we
know
you
already
she
said
we
ve
seen
you
out
rowing
on
the
lake
so
often
and
we
had
to
find
out
who
you
were
we
have
a
good
pair
of
glasses
merle
broke
in
her
companion
warningly
and
then
yesterday
we
sent
one
of
the
maids
over
reconnoitring
to
make
inquiries
and
bring
us
a
full
merle
how
can
you
say
such
things
it
was
a
cheery
little
feast
ah
how
young
they
were
these
two
girls
and
how
they
laughed
at
a
joke
and
what
quantities
of
bread
and
butter
and
coffee
they
all
three
disposed
of
merle
now
and
again
would
give
their
companion
a
sidelong
glance
while
thea
laughed
at
all
the
wild
things
her
friend
said
and
scolded
her
and
looked
anxiously
at
peer
and
now
the
sun
was
nearing
the
shoulder
of
a
hill
far
in
the
west
and
evening
was
falling
they
packed
up
their
things
and
peer
was
loaded
up
with
a
big
bag
of
on
his
back
and
a
tin
pail
to
carry
in
his
hand
give
him
some
more
said
merle
it
ll
do
him
good
to
work
for
a
merle
you
really
are
too
bad
here
you
are
said
the
girl
and
slid
the
handle
of
a
basket
into
his
other
hand
then
they
set
out
down
the
hill
merle
sang
and
yodelled
as
they
went
then
peer
sang
and
then
they
all
three
sang
together
and
when
they
came
to
a
or
a
puddle
they
did
not
trouble
to
go
round
but
just
jumped
over
it
and
then
gave
another
jump
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
they
passed
the
saeter
and
went
on
down
to
the
water
s
edge
and
peer
proposed
to
row
them
home
and
so
they
rowed
across
and
the
whole
time
they
sat
talking
and
laughing
together
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
the
boat
touched
land
just
below
the
cottage
and
a
man
with
a
grey
beard
and
a
straw
hat
came
down
to
meet
them
oh
father
are
you
back
again
cried
merle
and
springing
ashore
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
the
two
exchanged
some
whispered
words
and
the
father
glanced
at
peer
then
taking
off
his
hat
he
came
towards
him
and
said
politely
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
help
the
girls
this
is
herr
holm
engineer
and
egyptian
said
merle
and
this
is
i
hear
we
are
neighbours
said
uthoug
we
re
just
going
to
have
tea
so
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
perhaps
you
will
join
outside
the
cottage
stood
a
lady
with
a
pale
face
wearing
spectacles
she
had
a
thick
white
woollen
shawl
over
her
shoulders
but
even
so
she
seemed
to
feel
cold
welcome
she
said
and
peer
thought
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
there
were
two
small
low
rooms
with
an
open
fireplace
in
the
one
and
in
it
there
stood
a
table
ready
laid
but
from
the
moment
merle
entered
the
house
she
took
command
of
everything
and
whisked
in
and
out
soon
there
was
the
sound
of
fish
cooking
in
the
kitchen
and
a
moment
later
she
came
in
with
a
plate
full
of
lettuce
and
said
mr
egyptian
you
can
make
us
an
arabian
salad
can
t
you
peer
was
delighted
i
should
think
so
he
said
you
ll
find
salt
and
pepper
and
vinegar
and
oil
on
the
table
there
and
that
s
all
we
possess
in
the
way
of
condiments
but
it
must
be
a
real
arabian
salad
all
the
same
if
you
please
and
out
she
went
again
while
peer
busied
himself
with
the
salad
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
daughter
said
fru
uthoug
turning
her
pale
face
towards
him
and
looking
through
her
spectacles
she
is
not
really
so
wild
as
she
uthoug
himself
walked
up
and
down
the
room
chatting
to
peer
and
asking
a
great
many
questions
about
conditions
in
egypt
he
knew
something
about
the
mahdi
and
general
gordon
and
khartoum
and
the
strained
relations
between
the
khedive
and
the
sultan
he
was
evidently
a
diligent
reader
of
the
newspapers
and
peer
gathered
that
he
was
a
radical
and
a
man
of
some
weight
in
his
party
and
he
looked
as
if
there
was
plenty
of
fire
smouldering
under
his
reddish
eyelids
a
bad
man
to
fall
out
with
thought
peer
they
sat
down
to
supper
and
peer
noticed
that
fru
uthoug
grew
less
pale
and
anxious
as
her
daughter
laughed
and
joked
and
chattered
there
even
came
a
slight
glow
at
last
into
the
faded
cheeks
the
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
seemed
to
shine
with
a
light
borrowed
from
her
daughter
s
but
her
husband
seemed
not
to
notice
anything
and
tried
all
the
time
to
go
on
talking
about
the
mahdi
and
the
khedive
and
the
sultan
so
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
peer
sat
down
to
table
in
a
norwegian
home
and
how
good
it
was
would
he
ever
have
a
home
of
his
own
he
wondered
after
the
meal
a
mandolin
was
brought
out
and
they
sat
round
the
fire
in
the
great
fireplace
and
had
some
music
until
at
last
merle
rose
and
said
now
mother
it
s
time
you
went
to
yes
dear
came
the
answer
submissively
and
fru
uthoug
said
and
merle
led
her
off
peer
had
risen
to
take
leave
when
merle
came
in
again
why
she
said
you
re
surely
not
going
off
before
you
ve
rowed
thea
home
oh
merle
please
put
in
the
other
but
when
the
two
had
taken
their
places
in
the
boat
and
were
just
about
to
start
up
the
lake
merle
came
running
down
and
said
she
might
just
as
well
come
too
half
an
hour
later
having
seen
the
young
girl
safely
ashore
at
her
father
s
place
merle
and
peer
were
alone
rowing
back
through
the
still
night
over
the
waters
of
the
lake
golden
in
the
light
and
dark
blue
in
the
shadows
merle
leaned
back
in
the
stern
silent
trailing
a
small
branch
along
the
surface
of
the
water
behind
after
a
while
peer
laid
in
his
oars
and
let
the
boat
drift
how
beautiful
it
is
he
said
the
girl
lifted
her
head
and
looked
round
yes
she
answered
and
peer
fancied
her
voice
had
taken
a
new
tone
it
was
past
midnight
heights
and
woods
and
saeters
lay
lifeless
in
the
soft
suffused
reddish
light
the
were
not
rising
any
more
but
now
and
again
the
screech
of
a
could
be
heard
among
the
withies
what
made
you
come
just
here
for
your
holiday
i
wonder
she
asked
suddenly
i
leave
everything
to
chance
froken
uthoug
it
just
happened
so
it
s
all
so
homelike
here
wherever
one
goes
and
it
is
so
wonderful
to
be
home
in
norway
but
haven
t
you
been
to
see
your
people
your
father
and
mother
since
you
came
home
i
do
you
suppose
i
have
a
father
and
mother
but
near
relations
surely
you
must
have
a
brother
or
sister
somewhere
in
the
world
ah
if
one
only
had
though
after
all
one
can
get
on
she
looked
at
him
searchingly
as
if
trying
to
see
whether
he
spoke
in
earnest
then
she
said
do
you
know
that
mother
dreamed
of
you
before
you
came
of
me
peer
s
eyes
opened
wide
what
did
she
dream
about
me
a
sudden
flush
came
to
the
girl
s
face
and
she
shook
her
head
it
s
foolish
of
me
to
sit
here
and
tell
you
all
this
but
you
see
that
was
why
we
wanted
so
much
to
find
out
about
you
when
you
came
and
it
gives
me
a
sort
of
feeling
of
our
having
known
each
other
a
long
you
appear
to
have
a
very
constant
flow
of
high
spirits
froken
uthoug
i
why
do
you
think
oh
well
yes
one
can
come
by
most
things
you
know
if
one
has
to
have
even
high
spirits
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
towards
the
shore
some
day
perhaps
if
we
should
come
to
be
friends
i
ll
tell
you
more
about
peer
bent
to
his
oars
and
rowed
on
the
stillness
of
the
night
drew
them
nearer
and
nearer
together
and
made
them
silent
only
now
and
then
they
would
look
at
each
other
and
smile
what
mysterious
creature
is
this
i
have
come
upon
thought
peer
she
might
be
about
she
sat
there
with
bowed
head
and
in
this
soft
glow
the
oval
face
had
a
strange
light
of
dreams
upon
it
but
suddenly
her
glance
came
back
and
rested
on
him
again
and
then
she
smiled
and
he
saw
that
her
mouth
was
large
and
her
lips
full
and
red
i
wish
i
had
been
all
over
the
world
like
you
she
said
have
you
never
been
abroad
froken
uthoug
he
asked
i
spent
a
winter
in
berlin
once
and
a
few
months
in
south
germany
i
played
the
violin
a
little
you
see
and
i
hoped
to
take
it
up
seriously
abroad
and
make
something
of
it
but
well
why
shouldn
t
you
she
was
silent
for
a
little
then
at
last
she
said
i
suppose
you
are
sure
to
know
about
it
some
day
so
i
may
just
as
well
tell
you
now
mother
has
been
out
of
her
my
dear
froken
and
when
she
s
at
home
my
high
spirits
are
needed
to
help
her
to
be
more
or
less
he
felt
an
impulse
to
rise
and
go
to
the
girl
and
take
her
head
between
his
hands
but
she
looked
up
with
a
melancholy
smile
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
look
and
she
forgot
to
withdraw
her
glance
i
must
go
ashore
now
she
said
at
last
oh
so
soon
why
we
have
hardly
begun
our
talk
i
must
go
ashore
now
she
repeated
and
her
voice
though
still
gentle
was
not
to
be
gainsaid
at
last
peer
was
alone
rowing
back
to
his
saeter
as
he
rowed
he
watched
the
girl
going
slowly
up
towards
the
cottage
when
she
reached
the
door
she
turned
for
the
first
time
and
waved
to
him
then
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
after
him
and
then
opened
the
door
and
disappeared
he
gazed
at
the
door
some
time
longer
as
if
expecting
to
see
it
open
again
but
no
sign
of
life
was
to
be
seen
the
sun
s
rim
was
showing
now
above
the
distant
ranges
in
the
east
and
the
white
peaks
in
the
north
and
west
kindled
in
the
morning
glow
peer
laid
in
his
oars
again
and
rested
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
what
could
this
thing
be
that
had
befallen
him
today
how
could
those
peaks
stand
round
so
aloof
and
indifferent
and
leave
him
here
disconsolate
and
alone
what
was
it
this
new
rushing
in
his
ears
this
new
rhythm
of
his
pulse
he
lay
back
at
last
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
and
let
boat
and
all
things
drift
and
when
the
glare
of
the
rising
sun
came
slanting
into
the
boat
and
beat
dazzlingly
in
his
face
he
only
turned
his
head
a
little
and
let
it
shine
full
upon
him
now
she
is
lying
asleep
over
there
the
morning
streaming
red
through
her
window
of
whom
is
she
dreaming
as
she
sleeps
have
you
ever
seen
such
eyebrows
before
to
press
one
s
lips
to
them
to
take
her
head
between
one
s
hand
and
so
it
is
to
save
your
mother
that
you
give
up
your
own
dreams
and
to
warm
her
soul
that
you
keep
that
flame
of
gladness
burning
in
you
is
that
the
sort
you
are
merle
was
ever
such
a
name
are
you
called
merle
day
spreads
over
the
heavens
kindling
all
the
great
and
small
to
gold
and
scarlet
and
here
he
lies
rocking
rocking
on
no
lake
but
on
a
red
ocean
swell
ah
till
now
your
mind
has
been
so
filled
with
cold
mechanics
with
calculations
with
steel
and
fire
more
and
more
knowledge
ever
more
striving
to
understand
all
things
to
know
all
to
master
all
but
meanwhile
the
tones
of
the
hymn
died
within
you
and
the
hunger
for
that
which
lies
beyond
all
things
grew
ever
fiercer
and
fiercer
you
thought
it
was
norway
that
you
needed
and
now
you
are
here
but
is
it
enough
merle
is
your
name
merle
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
likened
to
the
first
day
of
love
all
your
learning
your
travel
and
deeds
and
dreams
all
has
been
nothing
but
dry
firewood
that
you
have
dragged
and
heaped
together
and
now
has
come
a
spark
and
the
whole
heap
blazes
up
casting
its
red
glow
over
earth
and
heaven
and
you
stretch
out
your
cold
hands
and
warm
them
and
shiver
with
joy
that
a
new
bliss
has
come
upon
the
earth
and
all
that
you
could
not
understand
the
relation
between
the
spark
of
eternity
in
your
soul
and
the
power
above
and
the
whole
of
endless
space
has
all
of
a
sudden
become
so
clear
that
you
lie
here
trembling
with
joy
at
seeing
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
infinite
enigma
you
have
but
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
here
are
we
two
you
say
to
the
powers
of
life
and
death
here
is
she
and
here
am
i
we
two
and
you
send
the
anthem
rolling
aloft
a
strain
from
little
louise
s
mingling
with
it
not
to
the
vaultings
of
any
church
but
into
endless
space
itself
and
thou
power
above
now
i
understand
thee
how
could
i
ever
take
seriously
a
power
that
sat
on
high
playing
with
sin
and
grace
but
now
i
see
thee
not
the
bloodthirsty
jehovah
but
a
youth
the
light
itself
we
two
worship
thee
not
with
a
wail
of
prayer
but
with
a
great
anthem
that
has
the
in
it
all
our
powers
our
knowledge
our
dreams
all
are
there
and
each
has
its
own
instrument
its
own
voice
in
the
mighty
chorus
the
dawn
reddening
over
the
hills
is
with
us
the
goat
grazing
on
that
northern
hillside
dazzled
with
when
it
turns
its
head
to
the
east
it
is
with
us
too
the
waking
birds
are
with
us
a
frog
crawling
up
out
of
a
puddle
and
stopping
to
wonder
at
the
morning
it
is
there
even
the
little
insect
with
diamonds
on
its
wings
and
the
with
its
pearl
of
dew
trying
to
mirror
as
much
of
the
sky
as
it
can
it
is
there
it
is
there
it
is
there
we
are
standing
amid
love
s
first
day
and
there
is
no
more
talk
of
grace
or
doubt
or
faith
or
need
of
aid
only
a
rushing
sound
of
music
rising
to
heaven
from
all
the
golden
rivers
in
our
hearts
the
saeters
were
beginning
to
wake
musical
cries
came
echoing
as
the
chid
on
the
cattle
that
moved
slowly
up
to
the
northern
heights
with
lowings
and
tinkling
of
bells
but
peer
lay
still
where
he
was
and
presently
the
at
the
saeter
caught
sight
of
what
seemed
an
empty
boat
drifting
on
the
lake
and
was
afraid
some
accident
had
happened
merle
thought
peer
still
lying
motionless
is
your
name
merle
the
was
down
by
the
waterside
now
calling
across
toward
the
boat
and
at
last
she
saw
a
man
sit
up
rubbing
his
eyes
mercy
on
us
she
cried
lord
be
thanked
that
you
re
there
and
you
haven
t
been
in
the
whole
blessed
night
a
goat
with
a
broken
leg
set
in
splints
had
been
left
to
stray
at
will
about
the
and
in
and
out
of
the
house
while
its
were
setting
peer
must
needs
pick
up
the
creature
and
carry
it
round
for
a
while
in
his
arms
though
it
at
once
began
chewing
at
his
beard
when
he
sat
down
to
the
he
found
something
so
touching
in
the
look
of
the
cream
and
butter
the
bread
and
the
coffee
that
it
seemed
a
man
would
need
a
heart
of
stone
to
be
willing
to
eat
such
things
and
when
the
old
woman
said
he
really
ought
to
get
some
food
into
him
he
sprang
up
and
embraced
her
as
far
as
his
arms
would
go
round
nice
carryings
on
she
cried
struggling
to
free
herself
but
when
he
went
so
far
as
to
imprint
a
sounding
kiss
on
her
forehead
she
fetched
him
a
mighty
push
lord
she
said
if
the
gomeril
hasn
t
gone
clean
out
of
his
wits
this
last
night
chapter
iv
ringeby
lay
on
the
shore
of
a
great
lake
and
was
one
of
those
busy
commercial
towns
which
have
sprung
up
in
the
last
fifty
years
from
a
nucleus
consisting
of
a
and
a
by
the
side
of
a
waterfall
now
quite
a
number
of
modern
factories
had
spread
upwards
along
the
river
and
the
place
was
a
town
with
some
four
thousand
inhabitants
with
a
church
of
its
own
a
monster
of
a
school
building
and
numbers
of
yellow
workmen
s
dwellings
scattered
about
at
random
in
every
direction
otherwise
ringeby
was
much
like
any
other
little
town
there
were
two
lawyers
who
fought
for
scraps
of
legal
business
and
the
editors
of
two
local
papers
who
were
constantly
at
loggerheads
before
the
conciliation
board
there
was
a
temperance
lodge
and
workers
union
and
a
chapel
and
a
picture
palace
and
every
sunday
afternoon
the
good
citizens
of
ringeby
walked
out
along
the
fjord
with
their
wives
on
their
arms
on
these
occasions
most
of
the
men
wore
frock
coats
and
grey
felt
hats
but
enebak
the
tanner
being
hunchbacked
preferred
a
tall
silk
hat
as
better
suited
to
eke
out
his
height
on
saturday
evenings
when
twilight
began
to
fall
the
younger
men
would
meet
at
the
corner
outside
hammer
s
store
to
discuss
the
events
of
the
week
have
you
heard
the
latest
news
asked
lovli
the
bank
cashier
of
his
friend
the
telegraphist
who
came
up
news
do
you
tell
me
that
there
s
ever
any
news
in
this
accursed
hole
merle
uthoug
has
come
back
from
the
mountains
engaged
to
be
the
devil
she
is
what
does
the
old
man
say
to
that
oh
well
the
old
man
will
want
an
engineer
if
he
s
to
get
the
new
into
his
is
the
man
an
engineer
from
egypt
a
muhammadan
i
daresay
brown
as
a
and
rolling
in
do
you
hear
that
froken
bull
stop
a
minute
here
s
some
news
for
the
girl
addressed
turned
aside
and
joined
them
oh
the
same
piece
of
news
that
s
all
over
the
town
i
suppose
well
i
can
tell
you
he
s
most
tremendously
sh
whispered
the
telegraphist
peer
holm
was
just
coming
out
of
the
grand
hotel
dressed
in
a
grey
suit
and
with
a
dark
coat
over
his
arm
he
was
trying
to
get
a
cigar
to
draw
as
he
walked
with
a
light
elastic
step
past
the
group
at
the
corner
a
little
farther
up
the
street
he
encountered
merle
and
took
her
arm
and
the
two
walked
off
together
the
young
people
at
the
corner
watching
them
as
they
went
and
when
is
it
to
be
asked
the
telegraphist
he
wanted
to
be
married
immediately
i
believe
said
froken
bull
but
i
suppose
they
ll
have
to
wait
till
the
banns
are
called
like
other
lorentz
uthoug
s
long
wooden
house
stood
facing
the
market
square
the
office
and
the
big
ironmonger
s
shop
were
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
family
lived
in
the
upper
storeys
that
s
where
he
lives
people
would
say
or
there
he
goes
as
the
broad
man
passed
down
the
street
was
he
such
a
big
man
then
he
could
hardly
be
called
really
rich
though
he
had
a
and
a
and
a
and
owned
a
country
place
some
way
out
of
the
town
but
there
was
something
of
the
chieftain
something
of
the
prophet
about
him
he
hated
priests
he
read
deep
philosophical
works
forbade
his
family
to
go
to
church
and
had
been
visited
by
bjornson
himself
it
was
good
to
have
him
on
your
side
to
have
him
against
you
was
fatal
you
might
just
as
well
clear
out
of
the
town
altogether
he
had
a
finger
in
everything
that
went
on
it
was
as
if
he
owned
the
whole
town
he
had
been
known
to
meet
a
youth
he
had
never
spoken
to
before
in
the
street
and
accost
him
with
a
peremptory
understand
me
young
man
you
will
marry
that
yet
for
all
this
lorentz
uthoug
was
not
altogether
content
true
he
was
head
and
shoulders
above
all
the
ringeby
folks
but
what
he
really
wanted
was
to
be
the
biggest
man
in
a
place
a
hundred
times
as
large
and
now
that
he
had
found
a
he
seemed
as
it
were
to
be
walking
quietly
round
this
stranger
from
the
great
world
taking
his
measure
and
asking
in
his
thoughts
who
are
you
at
bottom
what
have
you
seen
what
have
you
read
are
you
progressive
or
reactionary
have
you
any
proper
respect
for
what
i
have
accomplished
here
or
are
you
going
about
laughing
in
your
sleeve
and
calling
me
a
whale
among
the
minnows
every
morning
when
peer
woke
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
he
rubbed
his
eyes
on
the
table
beside
his
bed
stood
a
photograph
of
a
young
girl
what
is
it
really
you
peer
that
have
found
someone
to
stand
close
to
you
at
last
someone
in
the
world
who
cares
about
you
when
you
have
a
cold
there
ll
be
people
to
come
round
and
be
anxious
about
you
and
ask
how
you
are
getting
on
and
this
to
happen
to
you
he
dined
at
the
uthougs
every
day
and
there
were
always
flowers
beside
his
plate
often
there
would
be
some
little
surprise
a
silver
spoon
or
fork
or
a
with
his
initials
on
it
was
like
gathering
the
first
straws
to
make
his
new
nest
and
the
pale
woman
with
the
spectacles
looked
kindly
at
him
as
if
to
say
you
are
taking
her
from
me
but
i
forgive
one
day
he
was
sitting
in
the
hotel
reading
when
merle
came
in
will
you
come
for
a
walk
she
asked
good
idea
where
shall
we
go
well
we
haven
t
been
to
see
aunt
marit
at
bruseth
yet
we
really
ought
to
go
you
know
i
ll
take
you
there
peer
found
these
ceremonial
visits
to
his
new
relatives
quite
amusing
he
went
round
as
it
were
collecting
uncles
and
aunts
and
there
was
a
new
one
well
why
not
but
my
dear
girl
have
you
been
crying
he
asked
suddenly
taking
her
head
in
his
hands
oh
it
s
nothing
come
let
s
go
and
she
thrust
him
gently
away
as
he
tried
to
kiss
her
but
the
next
moment
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
looking
thoughtfully
at
him
through
eyes
nodding
her
head
very
slightly
she
seemed
to
be
asking
herself
who
is
this
man
what
is
this
i
am
taking
on
me
a
fortnight
ago
he
was
an
utter
stranger
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
it
s
mother
you
know
she
said
is
anything
special
wrong
she
s
so
afraid
you
re
going
to
carry
me
off
into
the
wide
world
at
a
moment
s
but
i
ve
told
her
we
re
going
to
live
here
for
the
the
girl
drew
up
one
side
of
her
mouth
in
a
smile
and
her
eyelids
almost
closed
and
what
about
me
then
after
living
here
all
these
years
crazy
to
get
out
into
the
world
and
i
who
am
crazy
to
stay
at
home
said
peer
with
a
laugh
how
delicious
it
will
be
to
have
a
house
and
a
family
at
last
and
peace
and
quiet
but
what
about
me
you
ll
be
there
too
i
ll
let
you
live
with
oh
how
stupid
you
are
if
you
only
knew
what
it
means
to
throw
away
the
best
years
of
one
s
youth
in
a
hole
like
this
and
besides
i
could
have
done
something
worth
while
in
music
why
then
let
s
go
abroad
by
all
means
said
peer
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
as
if
to
laugh
oh
nonsense
you
know
it
s
quite
impossible
to
go
off
and
leave
mother
now
but
you
certainly
came
at
a
very
critical
time
for
anyway
i
was
longing
and
longing
just
then
for
someone
to
come
and
carry
me
aha
so
i
was
only
a
sort
of
ticket
for
the
he
stepped
over
and
pinched
her
nose
oh
you
d
better
be
careful
i
haven
t
really
promised
yet
to
have
you
you
haven
t
promised
when
you
practically
asked
me
she
clapped
her
hands
together
why
what
shameless
impudence
after
my
saying
no
no
no
for
days
together
i
won
t
i
won
t
i
won
t
i
said
it
ever
so
many
times
and
you
said
it
didn
t
matter
for
you
would
yes
you
took
me
most
unfairly
off
my
guard
but
now
look
out
for
the
next
moment
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
but
when
he
tried
to
kiss
her
she
pushed
him
away
again
no
she
said
you
mustn
t
think
i
did
it
for
that
soon
they
were
walking
along
the
country
road
on
their
way
to
aunt
marit
at
bruseth
it
was
september
and
all
about
the
wooded
hills
stood
yellow
and
the
cornfields
were
golden
and
the
rowan
berries
but
there
was
still
summer
in
the
air
ugh
how
impossibly
fast
you
walk
exclaimed
merle
stopping
out
of
breath
and
when
they
came
to
a
gate
they
sat
down
in
the
grass
by
the
wayside
below
them
was
the
town
with
its
many
roofs
and
chimneys
standing
out
against
the
shining
lake
that
lay
framed
in
broad
stretches
of
farm
and
field
do
you
know
how
it
came
about
that
mother
is
as
she
is
asked
merle
suddenly
no
i
didn
t
like
to
ask
you
about
she
drew
a
stalk
of
grass
between
her
lips
well
you
see
mother
s
father
was
a
clergyman
and
when
when
father
forbade
her
to
go
to
church
she
obeyed
him
but
she
couldn
t
sleep
after
that
she
felt
as
if
she
had
sold
her
and
what
did
your
father
say
to
that
said
it
was
hysteria
but
hysteria
or
not
mother
couldn
t
sleep
and
at
last
they
had
to
take
her
away
to
a
poor
soul
said
peer
taking
the
girl
s
hand
and
when
she
came
back
from
there
she
was
so
changed
one
would
hardly
have
known
her
and
father
gave
way
a
little
more
than
he
ever
used
to
do
and
said
well
well
i
suppose
you
must
go
to
church
if
you
wish
but
you
mustn
t
mind
if
i
don
t
go
with
and
so
one
sunday
she
took
my
hand
and
we
went
together
but
as
we
reached
the
church
door
and
heard
the
organ
playing
inside
she
turned
back
no
it
s
too
late
now
she
said
it
s
too
late
and
she
has
never
been
and
she
has
always
been
strange
since
then
merle
sighed
the
worst
of
it
is
she
sees
so
many
evil
things
compassing
her
about
she
says
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
laugh
them
away
but
she
can
t
laugh
herself
and
so
i
have
to
but
when
i
go
away
from
her
oh
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
she
hid
her
face
against
his
shoulder
and
he
began
stroking
her
hair
tell
me
peer
she
looked
up
with
her
smile
who
is
right
mother
or
father
have
you
been
trying
to
puzzle
that
out
yes
but
it
s
so
hopeless
so
impossible
to
come
to
any
sort
of
certainty
what
do
you
think
tell
me
what
you
think
they
sat
there
alone
in
the
golden
autumn
day
her
head
pressed
against
his
shoulder
why
should
he
play
the
superior
person
and
try
to
put
her
off
with
vague
phrases
dear
merle
i
know
of
course
no
more
than
you
do
there
was
a
time
when
i
saw
god
standing
with
a
rod
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
just
punishment
and
rewards
to
all
eternity
then
i
thrust
him
from
me
because
he
seemed
to
me
so
unjust
and
at
last
he
vanished
melting
into
the
solar
systems
on
high
and
all
the
infinitesimal
growths
here
on
the
earth
below
what
was
my
life
what
were
my
dreams
my
joy
or
sorrow
to
these
where
was
i
making
for
ever
and
always
there
was
something
in
me
saying
he
is
but
where
somewhere
beyond
and
behind
the
things
you
know
it
is
there
he
is
and
so
i
determined
to
know
more
things
more
and
more
and
more
and
what
wiser
was
i
a
crushes
my
skull
one
day
and
what
has
become
of
my
part
in
progress
and
culture
and
science
am
i
as
much
of
an
accident
as
a
fly
on
an
ant
do
i
mean
no
more
do
i
vanish
and
leave
as
little
trace
answer
me
that
little
merle
what
do
you
think
the
girl
sat
motionless
breathing
softly
with
closed
eyes
then
she
began
to
smile
and
her
lips
were
full
and
red
and
at
last
they
shaped
themselves
to
a
kiss
bruseth
was
a
large
farm
lying
high
above
the
town
with
its
garden
and
avenues
and
long
verandahs
round
the
white
and
what
a
view
out
over
the
lake
and
the
country
far
around
the
two
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
gate
looking
back
merle
s
aunt
her
father
s
sister
was
a
widow
rich
and
a
notable
manager
but
capricious
to
a
degree
capable
of
being
generous
one
day
and
grasping
the
next
it
was
the
sorrow
of
her
life
that
she
had
no
children
of
her
own
but
she
had
not
yet
decided
who
was
to
be
her
heir
she
came
sailing
into
the
room
where
the
two
young
people
were
waiting
and
peer
saw
her
coming
towards
them
a
tall
woman
with
grey
hair
and
florid
colour
oho
here
s
an
aunt
for
you
with
a
vengeance
he
thought
she
pulled
off
a
blue
apron
she
was
wearing
and
appeared
dressed
in
a
black
woollen
gown
with
a
gold
chain
about
her
neck
and
long
gold
earrings
so
you
thought
you
d
come
over
at
last
she
said
actually
remembered
my
existence
after
all
did
you
merle
she
turned
towards
peer
and
stood
examining
him
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
so
that
s
what
you
look
like
is
it
peer
and
you
re
the
man
that
was
to
catch
merle
well
you
see
i
call
you
peer
at
once
even
though
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
arabia
is
it
sit
down
sit
wine
was
brought
in
and
aunt
marit
of
bruseth
lifted
a
congratulatory
glass
toward
the
pair
with
the
following
words
you
ll
fight
of
course
but
don
t
overdo
it
that
s
all
and
mark
my
words
peer
holm
if
you
aren
t
good
to
her
i
ll
come
round
one
fine
day
and
warm
your
ears
for
you
your
healths
children
the
two
went
homewards
dancing
down
the
hillsides
and
singing
gaily
as
they
went
but
suddenly
when
they
were
still
some
way
from
the
town
merle
stopped
and
pointed
there
she
whispered
there
s
mother
a
solitary
woman
was
walking
slowly
in
the
twilight
over
a
wide
field
of
stubble
looking
around
her
it
was
as
if
she
were
lingering
here
to
search
out
the
meaning
of
something
of
many
things
from
time
to
time
she
would
glance
up
at
the
sky
or
at
the
town
below
or
at
people
passing
on
the
road
and
then
she
would
nod
her
head
how
infinitely
far
off
she
seemed
how
utterly
a
stranger
to
all
the
noisy
doings
of
men
what
was
she
seeing
now
what
were
her
thoughts
let
us
go
on
whispered
merle
drawing
him
with
her
and
the
young
girl
suddenly
began
to
sing
loudly
as
if
in
an
overflow
of
spirits
and
peer
guessed
that
it
was
for
her
mother
s
sake
perhaps
the
lonely
woman
stood
there
now
in
the
twilight
smiling
after
them
one
sunday
morning
merle
drove
up
to
the
hotel
in
a
light
cart
with
a
big
brown
horse
peer
came
out
and
climbed
in
leaving
the
reins
to
her
they
were
going
out
along
the
fjord
to
look
at
her
father
s
big
estate
which
in
olden
days
had
been
the
county
governors
official
residence
it
is
the
end
of
september
the
sun
is
still
warm
but
the
waters
of
the
lake
are
grey
and
all
the
fields
are
reaped
here
and
there
a
strip
of
yellowing
lies
waiting
to
be
dug
up
up
on
the
hillsides
horses
tethered
for
grazing
stand
nodding
their
heads
slowly
as
if
they
knew
that
it
was
sunday
and
a
faint
mist
left
by
the
damps
of
the
night
floats
about
here
and
there
over
the
broad
landscape
they
passed
through
a
wood
and
came
on
the
other
side
to
an
avenue
of
old
ash
trees
that
turned
up
from
the
road
and
ran
uphill
to
a
big
house
where
a
flag
was
flying
the
great
white
stood
high
as
if
to
look
out
far
over
the
world
the
red
enclosed
the
wide
courtyard
on
three
sides
and
below
were
gardens
and
broad
lands
sloping
down
towards
the
lake
something
like
an
estate
what
s
the
name
of
that
place
cried
peer
gazing
at
it
and
who
owns
it
don
t
know
answered
the
girl
cracking
her
whip
next
moment
the
horse
turned
in
to
the
avenue
and
peer
caught
involuntarily
at
the
reins
hei
brownie
where
are
you
going
he
cried
why
not
go
up
and
have
a
look
said
merle
but
we
were
going
out
to
look
at
your
father
s
well
that
is
father
s
peer
stared
at
her
face
and
let
go
the
reins
what
what
you
don
t
mean
to
say
your
father
owns
that
place
there
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
strolling
through
the
great
rooms
the
whole
house
was
empty
now
the
living
in
the
servants
quarters
peer
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
here
in
these
great
rooms
there
had
been
festive
gatherings
enough
in
the
days
of
the
old
governors
where
cavaliers
in
uniform
or
with
elegant
and
golden
spurs
had
kissed
the
hands
of
ladies
in
sweeping
silk
robes
old
mahogany
convivial
song
wit
grace
peer
saw
it
all
in
his
mind
s
eye
and
again
and
again
he
had
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
by
seizing
merle
and
embracing
her
oh
but
look
here
merle
you
know
this
is
a
they
passed
out
into
the
old
neglected
garden
with
its
paths
and
and
pavilions
peer
rushed
about
it
in
all
directions
here
too
there
had
been
fetes
with
coloured
lamps
festooned
around
and
couples
whispering
in
the
shade
of
every
bush
merle
did
you
say
your
father
was
going
to
sell
all
this
to
the
state

answered
the
place

he
says
when

of
it
oh

home

imbeciles

have
guessed
it

idiot
asylum

be
he
tramped
about
fairly
jumping
with
excitement
merle

come
and
live

she
threw
back
her
head
and
looked
at
him
i

real
thing

it

great

there
was
some
reluctance
in
her
voice
was
she
thinking
of
her
violin
was
she
loth
to
take
root
too
firmly
a
great
deal
he
said
what
did
your
father
give
for
it
the
place

sold
by
auction

and
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
into
the
house
again
it
was
useless
to
try
to
resist
he
dragged
her
from
room

as
he
went
along

room

this
time
that
the
furnishing
was
complete
and
they
were
installed
they
had
a
governess
already
and
he
was
giving
parties
too
here
was
the
ballroom
he
slipped
an
arm
round
her
waist
and
danced
round
the
room
with
her
till
she
was
carried
away
by
his
enthusiasm
and
stood
flushed
and
beaming
while
all
she
had
dreamed
of
finding
some
day
out
in
the
wide
world
seemed
suddenly
to
unfold
around
her
here
in
these
empty
rooms
was
this
really
to
be
her
home
she
stopped
to
take
breath
and
to
look
around
her
late
that
evening

sat
at
the
hotel
with
a
working
the
thing

had
bought

been
reasonable
and
had
let

had
paid
himself
there

a
mortgage

on
the

one
day
he
was
sitting
alone
at

out
shopping
when
there
was
a
very
discreet
knock
at
the
door

in
walked
a
man
of
thirty
or
more

in
a
black
with

his
dark
hair
carefully
combed
over
a
bald
patch
on
the
crown
he
had
a
red
cheery
face
his
eyes
were
of
the
brightest
blue
and
the
whole
man
breathed
and
shone
with
good
humour

and
in
half
an
hour
the
two
were
firm
allies
uthoug
junior
s
to
date

quickly
told
he
had
run
away
from
home
because
his
father
had
refused
to
let
him
go
on
the
stage
had
found
on
trial
that
in
these
days
there
weren
t
enough
theatres
to
go
round
then
had
set
up
in
business
for
himself
and
now
had
a
general
agency
for
the
sale
of
english
tweeds
freedom
freedom
was
his
idea
lots
of
room
to
turn
about
in
without
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
to
father
or
anyone
your
health
a
week
later
the
street
outside
lorentz
uthoug
s
house
in
ringeby
was
densely
crowded
with
people
all
gazing
up
at
the
long
rows
of
lighted
windows
there
was
feasting
in
the
great
man
s
house
about
midnight
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
that
s
the
bridegroom
s
whispered
a
bystander
he
got
those
horses
from
denmark
the
street
door
opened
and
a
white
figure
thickly
cloaked
appeared
on
the
steps
the
bride
whispered
the
crowd
then
a
slender
man
in
a
dark
overcoat
and
silk
hat
the
bridegroom
and
as
the
pair
passed
out
went
the
voice
of
the
general
agent
for
english
tweeds
and
the
hurrahs
came
with
a
will
the
carriage
moved
off
and
peer
sat
with
his
arm
round
his
bride
driving
his
horses
at
a
sharp
trot
out
along
the
fjord
out
towards
his
home
towards
his
palace
towards
a
new
and
untried
future
chapter
v
a
little
shaggy
old
man
stood
chopping
and
sawing
in
the
at
loreng
he
had
been
there
longer
than
anyone
could
remember
one
master
left
another
took
his
place
what
was
that
to
the
little
man
didn
t
the
one
need
firewood
and
didn
t
the
other
need
firewood
just
the
same
in
the
evening
he
crept
up
to
his
den
in
the
loft
of
the
servants
wing
at
he
sat
himself
down
in
the
last
seat
at
the
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
always
food
to
be
had
nowadays
the
master
s
name
was
holm
an
engineer
he
was
and
the
little
man
blinked
at
him
with
his
eyes
and
went
on
chopping
in
the
shed
if
they
came
and
told
him
he
was
not
wanted
and
must
go
why
thank
heaven
he
was
stone
deaf
as
everyone
knew
thud
thud
went
his
axe
in
the
shed
and
the
others
about
the
place
were
so
used
to
it
that
they
heeded
it
no
more
than
the
ticking
of
a
clock
upon
the
wall
in
the
kitchen
of
the
big
house
two
girls
stood
by
the
window
peeping
out
into
the
garden
and
giggling
there
he
is
again
said
laura
sh
don
t
laugh
so
loud
there
now
he
s
stopping
again
he
s
whistling
to
a
bird
said
oliana
or
talking
to
himself
perhaps
do
you
think
he
s
quite
right
in
his
head
sh
the
mistress
ll
it
was
no
less
a
person
than
the
master
of
loreng
himself
whose
proceedings
struck
them
as
so
comic
peer
it
was
wandering
about
in
the
great
neglected
garden
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
knickerbockers
and
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
stopping
here
and
there
and
moving
on
again
as
the
fancy
took
him
sometimes
he
would
hum
a
snatch
of
a
song
and
again
fall
to
whistling
here
he
would
pick
up
a
twig
and
look
at
it
or
again
it
might
be
a
bird
or
perhaps
an
old
neglected
that
seemed
worth
stopping
to
talk
to
the
best
of
it
was
that
these
were
his
own
lands
and
his
own
woods
that
lay
there
in
the
rusty
october
sunshine
was
all
that
nothing
and
the
hill
over
on
the
farther
shore
standing
on
its
head
in
the
dark
clothed
in
a
whole
world
of
colour
yellow
leaves
and
green
leaves
and
light
red
and
dark
red
and
golden
and
patches
with
the
dark
green
of
the
pines
between
his
eyes
had
all
this
to
rest
on
did
he
really
live
here
what
abundant
fruitfulness
all
around
him
what
a
sky
so
wide
so
golden
that
it
seemed
to
ring
again
the
lay
uprooted
scattered
on
the
fields
the
corn
was
safely
housed
and
here
he
stood
he
seemed
again
to
be
drawing
in
nourishment
from
all
he
saw
drinking
it
greedily
the
empty
places
in
his
mind
were
filled
the
sight
of
the
rich
soft
landscape
worked
on
his
being
giving
it
something
of
its
own
abundant
fruitfulness
its
own
wide
repose
and
what
next
what
next
he
mimicked
in
his
thoughts
and
started
again
tramping
up
and
down
the
garden
paths
what
next
what
next
could
he
not
afford
now
to
take
his
time
to
rest
a
little
every
man
must
have
an
end
in
view
must
strive
to
reach
this
goal
or
that
and
what
was
his
object
now
what
was
it
he
had
so
toiled
for
from
those
hard
years
in
the
loft
above
the
stable
even
until
now
what
was
it
often
it
seemed
as
if
everything
were
going
smoothly
going
of
itself
as
if
one
day
surely
he
would
find
his
part
in
a
great
happy
but
had
he
not
already
found
it
what
more
would
he
have
of
course
he
had
found
it
but
is
this
all
then
what
is
there
behind
and
beyond
hush
have
done
with
questioning
look
at
the
beauty
around
you
here
is
peace
peace
and
rest
he
hurried
up
to
the
house
and
in
it
might
help
matters
if
he
could
take
his
wife
in
his
arms
perhaps
get
her
to
come
out
with
him
a
while
merle
was
in
the
pantry
with
a
big
apron
on
ranging
jars
of
preserves
on
the
shelves
here
dearest
little
wife
cried
peer
throwing
his
arms
about

hair

ll
make
it
come
peer
took
her
arm
and
led
her
over
to
a
window

out
on

lake

happy

were
and

to

ve
given
me
a
single
kiss
of
your
own
i
should
think
not
when
you

a
and
she
pushed
him
aside
and
slipped
under
his
arm
and
ran
out
of
the
room
i
must
go
in
and
see
mother
again
she
said
as
she
went
huit
of
course
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
step
growing
more
and
more
impatient
in
to
mother
in
to
mother
always
and
everlastingly
mother
and
mother
and
nothing
else

and
he
began
to
whistle
merle
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
peer

such
a
terrible
lot
of
spare
time
well

looking
about

every
corner
here
for
something
or
another
but
i
can

find
it
and
i
don
t
even
know
exactly
what
it
is
oh

plenty
of
time
to
but
what
about

stables
and

bailiff

but
what

day
cycle

to
see
how

going
but

excellent
and
engineer
surely
you
could
help
him
in
some
way
he

got
to
go
on
running
along
the
line
of
rails
he
s
used
to
nothing
else
for

my
darling
and
four
or
five
thousand
crowns
a
year

profit
why

magnificent
but
couldn
t
you
extend
the
business
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
his
mouth
pursed
itself
up
extend
did
you
say
extend
extend
a
a
doll
s
house
oh
peer
you
shouldn
t
laugh
at
it
a
thing
that
father
took
so
much
pains
to
set
going
and
you
shouldn
t
go
worrying
me
to
get
to
work
again
in
earnest
merle
you
shouldn
t
really
one
of
these
days
i
might
discover
that
there
s
no
way
to
be
happy
in
the
world
but
to
drag
a
plough
and
look
straight
ahead
and
forget
that
there
s
anything
else
in
existence
it
may
come
to
that
one
day
but
give
me
a
little
first
and
you
love
me
well
for
a
merle
busying
herself
again
in
her
pantry
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
saw
him
disappear
into
the
stables
at
first
she
had
gone
with
him
when
he
wandered
about
like
this
touching
and
feeling
all
his
possessions
in
the
it
might
be
stroking
and
patting
getting
himself
covered
with
hairs
and
chattering
away
in
childish
glee
look
merle
this
cow
is
mine
child
dagros
her
name
is
and
she
s
mine
we
have
forty
of
them
and
they
re
all
mine
and
that
nag
there
what
a
sight
he
is
we
have
eight
of
them
they
re
mine
yours
too
of
course
but
you
don
t
care
a
bit
about
it
you
haven
t
even
hugged
any
of
them
yet
but
when
a
man
s
been
as
poor
as
i
ve
been
and
suddenly
wakened
up
one
day
and
found
he
owned
all
this
no
wait
a
minute
merle
come
and
kiss
old
she
knew
the
ritual
now
he
could
go
over
it
all
again
and
again
and
each
time
with
the
same
happy
wonder
was
it
odious
of
her
that
she
was
beginning
to
find
it
a
little
comic
and
how
did
it
come
about
that
often
when
she
might
be
filled
with
the
deepest
longing
for
him
and
he
burst
in
upon
her
boisterously
hungry
for
her
caresses
she
would
grow
suddenly
cold
and
put
him
aside
what
was
the
matter
why
did
she
behave
like
this
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
so
much
the
stronger
so
overwhelming
in
his
effect
on
her
that
she
had
to
keep
a
tight
hold
on
herself
to
avoid
being
swept
clean
away
and
losing
her
identity
at
one
moment
they
might
be
sitting
in
the
lamplight
chatting
easily
together
and
so
near
in
heart
and
mind
and
the
next
it
would
be
over
he
would
suddenly
have
started
up
and
be
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
delivering
a
sort
of
lecture
merle
isn
t
it
marvellous
the
spiritual
life
of
plants
and
then
would
come
a
torrent
of
talk
about
strange
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
plants
whose
names
she
had
never
even
heard
their
struggle
for
existence
their
loves
and
longings
their
heroism
in
disease
the
divine
marvel
of
their
death
their
inventions
their
wisdom
aye
their
religious
sense
is
it
not
marvellous
merle
from
this
it
was
only
a
step
to
the
earth
s
strata
fossils
crystals
a
fresh
lecture
and
finally
he
would
sum
up
the
whole
into
one
great
harmony
of
development
from
the
primary
to
the
laws
of
gravitation
that
rule
the
courses
of
the
stars
was
it
not
marvellous
one
common
rhythm
beating
through
the
universe
a
symphony
of
worlds
and
then
he
must
have
a
kiss
but
she
could
only
draw
back
and
put
him
gently
aside
it
was
as
if
he
came
with
all
his
knowledge
his
lore
of
plants
and
fossils
crystals
and
stars
and
poured
it
all
out
in
a
caress
she
could
almost
have
cried
out
for
help
and
after
hurrying
her
through
the
wonders
of
the
universe
in
this
fashion
he
would
suddenly
catch
her
up
in
his
arms
and
whirl
her
off
in
a
passionate
intoxication
of
the
senses
till
she
woke
at
last
like
a
castaway
on
an
island
hardly
knowing
where
or
what
she
was
she
laughed
but
she
could
have
found
it
in
her
heart
to
weep
could
this
be
love
in
this
strong
man
whose
life
till
now
had
been
all
study
and
work
the
feeling
burst
vehemently
forth
now
that
it
had
found
an
outlet
but
why
did
it
leave
her
so
cold
when
peer
came
in
from
the
stables
humming
a
tune
he
found
her
in
the
dressed
in
a
dark
woollen
dress
with
a
red
ribbon
round
her
throat
he
stopped
short
by
jove
how
that
suits
you
merle
she
let
her
eyes
linger
on
him
for
a
moment
and
then
came
up
and
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
did
he
have
to
go
to
the
stables
all
alone
today
yes
i
ve
been
having
a
chat
with
the
young

but
we
ll
try
this
one
in
the
gig
merle
was
still
standing
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
now
she
pressed
her
warm
rich
lips
to
his
close
and
closer
it
was
at
such
moments
that
she
loved
him
when
he
stood
trembling
with
a
joy
unexpected
that
took
him
unawares
she
too
trembled
with
a
blissful
thrill
through
soul
and
body
for
once
and
at
last
it
was
she
who
gave
ah
he
breathed
at
last
pale
with
emotion
i
i
d
be
glad
to
die
like
a
little
later
they
stood
on
the
balcony
looking
over
the
courtyard
when
a
bearded
came
up
with
a
big
chestnut
horse
prancing
in
a
halter
the
beast
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
flung
up
its
head
and
neighed
and
the
horses
in
the
stable
neighed
in
answer
oh
what
a
beauty
exclaimed
merle
clapping
her
hands
put
him
into
the
gig
called
peer
to
the
who

horse

a
beginning
said
peer
merle
glanced
at
him
but
they
were
both
dressed
to
go
out
when
the
chestnut
came
dancing
up
before
the
door
with
the
gig
the
white
hoofs
pawed
impatiently
the
head
was
high
in
the
air
and
the
eyes
flashed
fire
he
wasn
t
used
to
having
shafts
pressing
on
his
sides
and
wheels
rumbling
just
behind
him
peer
lit
a
cigar
you
re
not
going
to
smoke
merle
burst
out
just
to
show
him
i
m
not
excited
said
peer
no
sooner
had
they
taken
their
seats
in
the
gig
than
the
beast
began
to
snort
and
rear
but
the
long
lash
flicked
out
over
its
neck
and
a
minute
later
they
were
tearing
off
in
a
cloud
of
dust
towards
the
town
winter
came
and
a
real
winter
it
was
peer
moved
about
from
one
window
to
another
calling
all
the
time
to
merle
to
come
and
look
he
had
been
away
so
long
the
winter
of
eastern
norway
was
all
new
to
him
look
look
a
world
of
white
a
frozen
white
tranquillity
woods
plains
lakes
all
in
white
a
in
sunlight
a
dreamland
at
night
under
the
great
bright
moon
there
was
a
ringing
of
out
on
the
lake
and
up
in
the
forest
the
frost
stood
thick
on
the
horses
manes
and
the
men
s
beards
were
hung
with
icicles
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
loud
reports
of
splitting
ice
would
come
from
the
lake
sounds
to
make
one
sit
up
in
bed
with
a
start
driving
s
worth
while
in
weather
like
this
come
merle
the
new
stallion
from
gudbrandsdal
wants
breaking
in
we
ll
take
him
hallo
and
away
they
go
in
their
furs
swinging
out
over
the
frozen
lake
whirling
on
to
the
bare
glassy
ice
where
they
skid
and
come
near
capsizing
and
merle
screams
but
they
get
on
to
snow
and
hoofs
and
runners
grip
again
none
of
your
galloping
trot
now
trot
and
peer
cracks
his
whip
the
black
gudbrandsdaler
lifts
his
head
and
trots
out
and
the
evening
comes
and
under
the
wide
and
starry
sky
they
dash
up
again
to
loreng
loreng
that
lies
there
lighting
them
home
with
its
long
rows
of
glowing
windows
a
glorious
day
wife
or
they
would
go
out
on
ski
over
the
hills
to
the
woodmen
s
huts
in
the
forest
and
make
a
blazing
fire
in
the
big
chimney
and
drink
steaming
coffee
then
home
again
through
one
of
those
pale
winter
evenings
with
a
violet
twilight
over
woods
and
fields
and
lake
over
white
snow
and
blue
far
away
on
the
brown
hillside
in
the
west
stands
a
farmhouse
with
all
its
windows
flaming
with
the
reflection
from
a
golden
cloud
here
they
come
rushing
the
wind
of
their
passing
shaking
the
snow
from
the
pines
on
on
over
woodcutters
roads
over
stumps
and
stones
falling
bruising
themselves
burying
their
faces
deep
in
the
snow
but
dragging
themselves
up
again
smiling
to
each
other
and
rushing
on
again
then
reaching
home
red
and
dripping
they
lean
the
ski
up
against
the
wall
and
stamp
the
snow
off
their
boots
merle
said
peer
picking
the
ice
from
his
beard
we
must
have
a
bottle
of
burgundy
at
dinner
yes
and
shall
we
ring
up
and
ask
someone
to
come
over
someone
from
outside

t
we
two
have
a
little
jollification
all
to
ourselves
yes
yes
of
course
if

a
change
of
underclothes
how
delicious
and
an
idea
he
ll
appear
at
dinner
in
evening
dress
just
for
a
surprise
but
as
he
entered
the
room
he
stopped
short
for
there
stood
merle
herself
in
evening
dress
a
dress
of
dark
red
velvet
with
his
locket
round
her
neck
and
the
big
plaits
of
hair
rolled
into
a
generous
knot
low
on
her
neck
flowers
on
the
table
the
wine
set
to
warm
the
finest
glass
the
best
silver
ptarmigan
how
splendid
they
lift
their
glasses
filled
with
the
red
wine
and
drink
to
each
other
the
frozen
winter
landscape
still
lingered
in
their
thoughts
but
the
sun
had
warmed
their
souls
they
laughed
and
jested
held
each
other
s
hands
long
and
sat
smiling
at
each
other
in
long
silences
a
glorious
day
merle
and
we
what
do
you
say
or
fifty
years
hence
it
comes
to
the
same
he
pressed
her
hand
and
his
eyes
half
closed
but
this
evening
we
re
together
and
what
could
we
want
more
then
he
fell
to
talking
of
his
egyptian
experiences
he
had
once
spent
a
month
s
holiday
in
visiting
ruined
cities
with
maspero
the
great
maspero
himself
going
with
him
to
luxor
to
karnak
with
its
great
avenues
of
sphinxes
to
el
amarna
and
shubra
they
had
looked
on
ancient
cities
of
temples
and
king
s
mausoleums
where
men
thousands
of
years
dead
lay
as
if
lost
in
thought
with
eyes
wide
open
ready
at
any
moment
to
rise
and
call
out
slave
is
the
bath
ready
there
in
the
middle
of
a
cornfield
rises
an
obelisk
you
ask
what
it
is
it
is
all
that
is
left
of
a
royal
city
there
too
a
hundred
thousand
years
ago
maybe
young
couples
have
sat
together
drinking
to
each
other
in
wine
revelling
in
all
the
delights
of
love
and
where
are
they
now
aye
where
are
they
can
you
tell
me
when
that
journey
was
over
merle
i
began
to
think
that
it
was
not
mere
slime
of
the
nile
that
fertilised
the
fields
it
was
the
mouldered
bodies
of
the
dead
i
rode
over
dust
that
had
been
human
fingers
lips
that
had
clung
in
kisses
millions
and
millions
of
men
and
women
have
lived
on
those
and
what
has
become
of
them
now
geology
and
i
thought
of
the
millions
of
prayers
wailed
out
there
to
the
sun
and
stars
to
stone
idols
in
the
temples
to
crocodiles
and
snakes
and
the
river
itself
the
sacred
river
and
the
air
merle
the
air
received
them
and
vibrated
for
a
second
and
that
was
all
and
even
so
our
prayers
go
up
to
this
very
day
we
press
our
warm
lips
to
a
cold
stone
and
think
to
leave
an
impression
skaal
but
merle
did
not
touch
her
glass
she
sat
still
with
her
eyes
on
the
yellow
lampshade
she
had
not
yet
given
up
all
her
dreams
of
going
forth
and
conquering
the
world
with
her
music
and
he
sat
there
rolling
out
eternity
itself
before
her
while
he
and
she
herself
her
parents
all
all
became
as
chaff
blown
before
the
wind
and
vanished
what
won
t
you
drink
with
me
well
well
then
i
must
pledge
you
by
myself
skaal
and
being
well
started
on
his
travellers
tales
he
went
on
with
them
but
now
in
a
more
cheerful
vein
so
that
she
found
it
possible
to
smile
he
told
of
the
great
with
their
legions
of
birds
ibis
pelicans
swans
flamingos
herons
and
storks
a
world
of
long
beaks
and
curved
breasts
and
legs
and
shrieking
and
beating
of
wings
most
wonderful
of
all
it
was
to
stand
and
watch
and
be
left
behind
when
the
birds
of
passage
flew
northward
in
their
thousands
in
the
spring
my
love
to
norway
he
would
say
as
they
passed
and
in
the
autumn
to
see
them
return
grey
goose
starling
wagtail
and
all
the
rest
how
goes
it
now
at
home
he
would
think
and
next
time
i
ll
go
with
you
he
would
promise
himself
year
after
year
and
here
i
am
at
last
skaal
welcome
home
said
merle
lifting
her
glass
with
a
smile
he
rang
the
bell
what
do
you
want
her
eyes
asked
champagne
said
peer
to
the
maid
who
appeared
and
vanished
again
are
you
crazy
peer
he
leaned
back
flushed
and
in
happy
mood
lit
a
cigarette
and
told
of
his
greatest
triumph
out
there
it
was
after
he
had
finished
his
work
at
the
cataracts
and
had
started
again
with
a
branch
of
the
english
firm
in
alexandria
one
morning
in
walked
the
chief
and
said
now
gentlemen
here
s
a
chance
for
a
man
that
has
the
stuff
in
him
to
win
his
spurs
who
s
ready
and
half
a
score
of
voices
answered
well
here
s
the
king
of
abyssinia
suddenly
finds
he
must
be
in
the
fashion
and
have
a
railway
couple
of
hundred
miles
of
it
what
do
you
say
to
that
splendid
we
cried
in
chorus
well
but
we
ve
got
to
compete
with
germans
and
swiss
and
americans
and
we
ve
got
to
of
course
a
louder
chorus
still
now
i
m
going
to
take
two
men
and
give
them
a
free
hand
they
ll
go
up
there
and
survey
and
lay
out
lines
and
work
out
the
whole
project
thoroughly
both
from
the
technical
and
the
financial
side
and
a
project
that
s
better
and
cheaper
than
the
opposition
ones
eight
months
work
for
a
good
man
but
i
must
have
it
done
in
four
take
along
assistants
and
equipment
all
you
need
and
a
thousand
pounds
premium
to
the
man
who
puts
it
through
so
that
we
get
the
peer
were
you
sent
merle
half
rose
from
her
seat
in
her
excitement
i
and
one
who
was
that
his
name
was
ferdinand
merle
smiled
her
smile
and
looked
at
him
through
her
long
lashes
she
knew
it
had
been
the
dream
of
his
life
to
beat
that
of
his
in
fair
fight
and
now
and
what
came
of
it
she
asked
with
a
seeming
careless
glance
at
the
lamp
peer
flung
away
his
cigarette
first
an
expedition
up
the
nile
then
a
caravan
journey
camels
and
mules
and
assistants
and
provisions
and
instruments
and
tents
and
quinine
heaps
of
quinine
have
you
any
idea
i
wonder
what
a
job
like
that
means
the
line
was
to
run
through
forests
and
tunnels
over
swamps
and
torrents
and
chasms
and
everything
had
to
be
planned
and
estimated
at
top
speed
material
labour
time
cost
and
all
it
was
all
very
well
to
provide
for
the
proper
spans
and
girders
for
a
viaduct
and
estimate
for
thoroughly
sound
work
in
casting
and
erecting
but
even
then
it
would
be
no
good
if
the
germans
could
come
along
and
say
their
bridge
looked
handsomer
than
ours
it
was
a
job
that
would
take
a
good
man
eight
months
and
i
had
to
get
it
done
in
four
there
are
just
twelve
hours
in
a
day
it
s
true
but
then
there
are
twelve
more
hours
in
the
night
fever
well
yes
and
sunstroke
yes
both
men
and
beasts
went
down
with
that
maps
got
washed
out
by
the
rain
i
lost
my
best
assistant
by
snakebite
but
such
things
didn
t
count
as
hindrances
they
couldn
t
be
allowed
to
delay
the
work
if
i
lost
a
man
it
simply
meant
so
much
more
work
for
me
after
a
couple
of
months
a
blacksmith
s
hammer
started
thumping
in
the
back
of
my
head
and
when
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
night
little
fiery
snakes
went
wriggling
about
in
my
brain
tired
out
when
i
looked
in
the
glass
my
eyes
were
just
two
red
balls
in
my
head
but
when
the
four
months
were
up
i
was
back
in
the
chief
s
and
and
ferdinand
holm
had
got
in
the
day
merle
shifted
a
little
in
her
seat
and
so
he
won
peer
lit
another
cigarette
no
he
said
the
cigarette
seemed
to
draw
rather
badly
i
won
and
that
s
how
i
came
to
be
building
railways
in
here
s
the
champagne
said
merle
and
as
the
wine
foamed
in
the
glasses
she
rose
and
drank
to
him
she
said
nothing
only
looked
at
him
with
eyes
half
veiled
and
smiled
but
a
wave
of
fire
went
through
him
from
head
to
foot
i
feel
like
playing
she
said
it
was
rarely
that
she
played
though
he
had
often
begged
her
to
since
they
had
been
married
she
had
seemed
loth
to
touch
her
violin
feeling
perhaps
some
vague
fear
that
it
would
disturb
her
peace
and
awaken
old
longings
peer
sat
on
the
sofa
leaning
forward
with
his
head
in
his
hands
listening
and
there
she
stood
at
the
in
her
red
dress
flushed
and
warm
and
shining
in
the
yellow
lamplight
playing
then
suddenly
the
thought
of
her
mother
came
to
her
and
she
went
to
the
telephone
mother
are
you
there
mother
oh
we
ve
had
such
a
glorious
and
the
girl
ran
on
as
if
trying
to
light
up
her
mother
s
heart
with
some
rays
of
the
happiness
her
own
happy
day
had
brought
her
a
little
later
peer
lay
in
bed
while
merle
flitted
about
the
room
lingering
over
her
toilet
he
watched
her
as
she
stood
in
her
long
white
gown
before
the
with
the
little
lamps
doing
her
hair
for
the
night
in
a
long
plait
neither
of
them
spoke
he
could
see
her
face
in
the
glass
and
saw
that
her
eyes
were
watching
him
with
a
soft
mysterious
glance
the
scent
of
her
hair
seemed
to
fill
the
place
with
youth
she
turned
round
towards
him
and
smiled
and
he
lay
still
beckoning
her
towards
him
with
shining
eyes
all
that
had
passed
that
evening
their
outing
and
the
homeward
journey
in
the
violet
dusk
their
little
feast
and
his
story
the
wine
all
had
turned
to
love
in
their
hearts
and
shone
out
now
in
their
smile
it
may
be
that
some
touch
of
the
cold
breath
of
the
eternities
was
still
in
their
minds
the
remembrance
of
the
millions
on
millions
that
die
the
flight
of
the
aeons
towards
endless
darkness
yet
in
spite
of
all
the
minutes
now
to
come
their
warm
embrace
held
a
whole
world
of
bliss
that
all
and
made
peer
as
he
lay
there
long
to
send
out
a
hymn
of
praise
into
the
universe
because
it
was
so
wonderful
to
live
he
began
to
understand
why
she
lingered
and
took
so
long
it
was
a
sign
that
she
wanted
to
surprise
him
that
her
heart
was
kind
and
her
light
breathing
seemed
even
now
to
fill
the
room
with
love
outside
in
the
night
the
splitting
into
new
crevices
sent
up
loud
reports
and
the
winter
sky
above
the
roof
that
sheltered
them
was
lit
with
all
its
stars
chapter
vi
for
the
next
few
years
peer
managed
his
estate
and
his
workshop
without
giving
too
much
of
his
time
to
either
he
had
his
bailiff
and
his
and
the
work
went
on
well
enough
in
its
accustomed
grooves
if
anyone
had
asked
him
what
he
actually
did
himself
all
the
time
he
would
have
found
it
hard
to
answer
he
seemed
to
be
going
round
gathering
up
something
not
clearly
defined
there
was
something
wanting
something
missed
that
now
had
to
be
made
good
it
was
not
knowledge
now
but
life
life
in
his
native
land
the
life
of
youth
that
he
reached
out
to
grasp
the
youth
in
him
that
had
never
had
free
play
in
the
years
of
early
manhood
lay
still
dammed
up
and
had
to
find
an
outlet
there
were
festive
gatherings
at
loreng
long
rows
of
sleighs
drove
in
the
winter
evenings
up
from
the
town
and
back
again
tables
were
spread
and
decked
with
glass
and
flowers
the
rooms
were
brightly
lit
and
the
wine
was
good
and
sometimes
in
the
long
moonlit
nights
respectable
citizens
would
be
awakened
by
noisy
mirth
in
the
streets
of
the
little
town
and
going
to
the
window
in
their
would
see
sleighs
come
galloping
down
with
a
jangle
of
bells
full
of
laughing
singing
young
people
returning
from
some
excursion
far
up
in
the
hills
where
there
had
been
feasting
and
dancing
here
a
young
lawyer
newly
married
and
something
of
a
privileged
buffoon
was
sitting
on
the
lap
of
somebody
else
s
wife
playing
a
concertina
and
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
some
of
that
loreng
man
s
doings
again
people
would
say
the
place
has
never
been
the
same
since
he
came
and
they
would
get
back
to
bed
again
shaking
their
heads
and
wondering
what
things
were
coming
to
peer
drove
out
too
on
occasion
to
parties
at
the
big
country
houses
round
where
they
would
play
cards
all
night
and
have
champagne
sent
up
to
their
rooms
next
morning
the
hosts
being
men
who
knew
how
to
do
things
in
style
this
was
glorious
not
mathematics
or
religion
any
more
what
he
needed
now
was
to
assimilate
something
of
the
country
life
of
his
native
land
he
was
not
going
to
be
a
stranger
in
his
own
country
he
wanted
to
take
firm
root
and
be
able
to
feel
like
others
that
he
had
a
spot
in
the
world
where
he
was
at
home
then
came
the
sunny
day
in
june
when
he
stood
by
merle
s
bed
and
she
lay
there
smiling
faintly
her
smile
with
a
newborn
girl
on
her
arm
what
are
we
to
call
her
peer
why
we
settled
that
long
ago
after
your
mother
of
of
course
her
name
s
to
be
louise
said
merle
turning
the
tiny
red
face
towards
her
breast
this
came
as
a
fresh
surprise
she
had
been
planning
it
for
weeks
perhaps
and
now
it
took
him
unawares
like
one
of
her
spontaneous
caresses
but
this
time
a
caress
to
his
inmost
soul
he
made
a
faint
attempt
at
a
joke
oh
well
i
never
have
any
say
in
my
own
house
i
suppose
you
must
have
it
your
own
he
stroked
her
forehead
and
when
she
saw
how
deeply
moved
he
was
she
smiled
up
at
him
with
her
most
radiant
smile
on
one
of
the
first
days
of
the
peer
lay
out
on
a
sunny
hillside
with
his
head
resting
on
a
haycock
watching
his
people
at
work
the
mowing
machine
was
buzzing
down
by
the
lake
the
spreader
at
work
on
the
the
horses
straining
in
front
the
men
sitting
behind
driving
the
whole
landscape
lay
around
him
breathing
summer
and
fruitfulness
and
he
himself
lay
there
sunk
in
his
own
restful
quiet
a
woman
in
a
light
dress
and
a
yellow
straw
hat
came
down
the
field
road
pushing
a
child
s
cart
before
her
it
was
merle
and
merle
was
looking
round
her
and
humming
as
she
came
since
the
birth
of
her
child
her
mind
was
at
peace
it
was
clear
that
she
was
scarcely
dreaming
now
of
conquering
the
world
with
her
music
there
was
a
tiny
being
in
the
little
cart
that
claimed
all
her
dreams
never
before
had
her
skin
been
so
dazzling
her
smile
so
red
it
was
as
if
her
youth
now
first
blossomed
out
in
all
its
fullness
her
eyes
seemed
opened
wide
in
a
dear
surprise
after
a
while
peer
went
down
and
drove
the
mowing
machine
himself
he
felt
as
if
he
must
get
to
work
somehow
or
other
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
child
but
suddenly
he
stopped
got
down
and
began
to
walk
round
the
machine
and
examine
it
closely
his
face
was
all
alert
now
his
eyes
keen
and
piercing
he
stared
at
the
mechanism
of
the
blades
and
stood
awhile
thinking
what
was
this
a
happy
idea
was
beginning
to
work
in
his
mind
vague
only
as
yet
there
was
still
time
to
thrust
it
aside
should
he
warm
mild
days
and
luminous
nights
sometimes
he
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
how
delicious
it
was
to
lie
awake
and
see
the
sun
come
up
on
one
such
night
he
got
up
and
dressed
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
a
trampling
of
hoofs
in
the
and
the
chestnut
stallion
appeared
with
peer
leading
him
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
trotted
off
down
the
road
a
white
figure
in
his
drill
suit
and
cork
helmet
where
was
he
going
nowhere
it
was
a
change
to
be
up
at
an
unusual
hour
and
see
the
day
break
on
a
july
morning
he
trotted
along
at
an
easy
pace
rising
lightly
in
the
stirrups
and
enjoying
the
pleasant
warmth
the
rider
feels
all
was
quiet
around
him
the
homesteads
still
asleep
the
sky
was
a
pearly
white
with
here
and
there
a
few
golden
clouds
reflected
in
the
lake
below
and
the
broad
meadows
still
spread
their
abroad
there
was
a
scent
in
the
air
of
leaf
and
and
pine
he
drew
in
deep
breaths
of
it
and
could
have
sung
aloud
he
turned
into
the
up
the
hill
dismounting
now
and
again
to
open
a
gate
past
farms
and
little
cottages
ever
higher
and
higher
till
at
last
he
reached
the
topmost
ridge
and
halted
in
a
clearing
the
chestnut
threw
up
his
head
and
sniffed
the
air
horse
and
rider
were
wet
with
the
from
the
trees
that
were
now
just
flushing
in
the
first
glow
of
the
coming
sun
far
below
was
the
lake
reflecting
sky
and
hills
and
farmsteads
all
asleep
and
there
in
the
east
were
the
red
flames
the
sun
the
day
the
horse
pawed
impatiently
at
the
ground
eager
to
go
on
but
peer
held
him
back
he
sat
there
gazing
under
the
brim
of
his
helmet
at
the
sunrise
and
felt
a
wave
of
strange
feeling
passing
through
his
mind
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
he
should
ever
reach
a
higher
pitch
of
sheer
delight
in
life
he
was
still
young
and
strong
all
the
organs
of
his
body
worked
together
in
happy
harmony
no
cares
to
weigh
upon
his
mind
no
crushing
responsibilities
the
future
lying
calm
and
clear
in
the
light
of
day
free
from
dizzy
dreams
his
hunger
after
knowledge
was
appeased
he
felt
that
what
he
had
learned
and
seen
and
gathered
was
beginning
to
take
living
organic
form
in
his
mind
but
then
what
then
the
great
human
type
of
which
you
dreamed
have
you
succeeded
in
giving
it
life
in
yourself
you
know
what
is
common
knowledge
about
the
progress
of
humanity
its
struggle
towards
higher
forms
its
gropings
up
by
many
ways
toward
the
infinite
which
it
calls
god
you
know
something
of
the
life
of
plants
the
nest
of
a
bird
is
a
mystery
before
which
you
could
kneel
in
worship
a
rock
shows
you
the
marks
of
a
glacier
that
scraped
over
it
thousands
of
years
ago
and
looking
on
it
you
have
a
glimpse
of
the
gigantic
workings
of
the
solar
system
and
on
autumn
evenings
you
look
up
at
the
stars
and
the
light
and
the
death
and
the
dizzy
abysses
of
space
above
you
send
a
solemn
thrill
through
your
soul
and
this
has
become
a
part
of
yourself
the
joy
of
life
for
you
is
to
grasp
all
you
can
compass
of
the
universe
and
let
it
permeate
your
thought
and
sense
on
every
side
but
what
then
is
this
enough
is
it
enough
to
rest
thus
in
yourself
have
you
as
yet
raised
one
upon
which
other
men
can
climb
and
say
now
we
can
see
farther
than
before
what
is
your
inner
being
worth
unless
it
be
mirrored
in
action
if
the
world
one
day
came
to
be
peopled
with
none
but
supermen
what
profit
in
that
as
long
as
they
must
die
what
is
your
faith
ah
this
sense
of
exile
of
religious
homelessness
how
many
times
have
you
and
merle
lain
clasping
each
other
s
hands
your
thoughts
wandering
together
hand
in
hand
seeking
over
earth
or
among
the
stars
for
some
being
to
whom
you
might
send
up
a
prayer
no
slavish
begging
cry
for
grace
and
favour
but
a
jubilant
thanksgiving
for
the
gift
of
life
but
where
was
he
he
is
not
and
yet
he
is
but
the
ascetic
on
the
cross
is
a
god
for
the
sick
and
aged
what
of
us
others
when
shall
the
modern
man
strong
scientifically
schooled
find
a
temple
for
the
sacred
music
the
anthem
of
eternity
in
his
soul
the
sun
rose
up
from
behind
a
distant
scattering
gold
over
the
million
spires
of
the
peer
bent
forward
with
dewdrops
on
his
hand
and
his
white
sleeve
and
patted
the
neck
of
his
restless
beast
it
was
two
o
clock
the
fires
of
morning
were
lit
in
the
clouds
and
in
all
the
waters
over
the
earth
the
dew
in
the
meadows
and
the
pearls
on
the
wings
of
butterflies
began
to
glisten
now
then
bijou
now
for
home
and
he
dashed
off
down
the
forest
paths
the
chestnut
snorting
as
he
galloped
chapter
vii
hei
merle
we
re
going
to
have
distinguished
visitors
where
in
the
world
have
you
got
to
peer
hurried
through
the
rooms
with
an
open
telegram
in
his
hand
and
at
last
came
upon
his
wife
in
the
nursery
oh
is
it
here
you
are
yes
but
you
shout
so
i
could
hear
you
all
through
the
house
who
is
it
that
s
coming
ferdinand
holm
and
klaus
brock
coming
to
the
christening
after
all
great
caesar
what
do
you
say
to
that
merle
merle
was
pale
and
her
cheeks
a
little
sunken
two
years
more
had
passed
and
she
had
her
second
child
now
on
her
knee
a
little
boy
with
big
wondering
eyes
how
fine
for
you
peer
she
said
and
went
on
undressing
the
child
yes
but
isn
t
it
splendid
of
them
to
set
off
and
come
all
that
way
just
because
i
asked
them
by
jove
we
must
look
sharp
and
get
the
place
smartened
up
a
and
sure
enough
the
whole
place
was
soon
turned
cartloads
of
sand
coming
in
for
the
garden
walks
and
the
courtyard
and
painters
hard
at
work
repainting
the
houses
and
poor
merle
knew
very
well
that
there
would
be
serious
trouble
if
anything
should
be
amiss
with
the
entertainment
indoors
at
last
came
the
hot
august
day
when
the
flags
were
hoisted
in
honour
of
the
expected
guests
once
more
the
hum
of
mowing
machines
and
came
from
the
and
the
air
was
so
still
that
the
columns
of
smoke
from
the
chimneys
of
the
town
rose
straight
into
the
air
peer
had
risen
early
to
have
a
last
look
round
inspecting
everything
critically
from
the
summer
dress
merle
was
to
wear
down
to
the
horses
in
the
stable
groomed
till
their
coats
shone
again
merle
understood
he
had
been
a
beside
the
son
of
the
doctor
and
something
meaner
yet
in
relation
to
the
distinguished
holm
family
and
there
was
still
so
much
of
the
boy
in
him
that
he
wanted
to
show
now
at
his
very
best
a
crowd
of
inquisitive
idlers
had
gathered
down
on
the
steamboat
landing
when
the
boat
swung
in
and
lay
by
the
pier
the
pair
of
bays
in
the
loreng
carriage
stood
tossing
their
heads
and
twitching
and
stamping
as
the
flies
tormented
them
but
at
last
they
got
their
passengers
and
were
given
their
heads
setting
off
with
a
wild
bound
or
two
that
scattered
those
who
had
pressed
too
near
but
in
the
carriage
they
could
see
the
two
strangers
and
the
engineer
all
three
laughing
and
gesticulating
and
talking
all
at
once
and
in
a
few
moments
they
vanished
in
a
cloud
of
dust
whirling
away
beside
the
calm
waters
of
the
fjord
some
way
behind
them
a
cart
followed
driven
by
one
of
the
from
loreng
and
loaded
with
big
leather
trunks
and
a
huge
chest
apparently
of
wood
but
evidently
containing
something
frightfully
heavy
merle
had
finished
dressing
and
stood
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
the
light
summer
dress
was
pretty
she
thought
and
the
red
bows
at
neck
and
waist
sat
to
her
satisfaction
then
came
the
roll
of
wheels
outside
and
she
went
out
to
receive
her
guests
here
they
are
cried
peer
jumping
down
this
is
ferdinand
pasha
of
the
new
kingdom
of
sahara
and
this
is
his
highness
the
khedive
s
chief
and
a
tall
stooping
man
with
white
hair
and
a
face
advanced
towards
merle
it
was
ferdinand
holm
how
do
you
do
madam
he
said
giving
her
a
dry
bony
hand
why
this
is
quite
a
baronial
seat
you
have
here
he
added
looking
round
and
settling
his
his
companion
was
a
round
plump
gentleman
with
a
little
black
goatee
beard
and
dark
eyes
that
blinked
continually
but
his
smile
was
full
of
mirth
and
the
grip
of
his
hand
felt
true
so
this
was
klaus
brock
peer
led
his
two
friends
in
through
the
rooms
showing
them
the
view
from
the
various
windows
klaus
broke
into
a
laugh
at
last
and
turned
to
merle
he
s
just
the
same
as
ever
he
said
a
little
stouter
to
be
sure
it
s
clear
you
ve
been
treating
him
well
and
he
bowed
and
kissed
her
hand
there
was
hock
and
seltzer
ready
for
them
this
was
merle
s
idea
as
suitable
for
a
hot
day
and
when
the
two
visitors
had
each
drunk
off
a
couple
of
glasses
with
an
ah
delicious
peer
came
behind
her
stroked
her
hand
lightly
and
whispered
thanks
merle
idea
of
by
the
way
exclaimed
ferdinand
holm
suddenly
i
must
send
off
a
telegram
may
i
use
the
telephone
a
moment
there
he
goes
can
t
contain
himself
any
longer
burst
out
klaus
brock
with
a
laugh
he
s
had
the
telegraph
wires
going
hard
all
the
way
across
europe
but
you
might
let
us
get
inside
and
sit
down
before
you
begin
again
come
along
said
peer
here
s
the
when
the
two
had
left
the
room
klaus
turned
to
merle
with
a
smile
well
well
so
i
m
really
in
the
presence
of
peer
s
wife
his
wife
in
flesh
and
blood
and
this
is
what
she
looks
like
that
fellow
always
had
all
the
and
he
took
her
hand
again
and
kissed
it
merle
drew
it
away
and
blushed
you
are
not
married
then
brock
i
well
yes
and
no
i
did
marry
a
greek
girl
once
but
she
ran
away
just
my
and
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
sighed
with
an
expression
so
comically
sad
that
merle
burst
out
laughing
and
your
friend
ferdinand
holm
she
asked
he
dear
lady
he
why
saving
your
presence
i
have
an
idea
there
s
a
select
little
harem
attached
to
that
palace
of
merle
turned
towards
the
window
and
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
an
hour
later
the
visitors
came
down
from
their
rooms
after
a
wash
and
a
change
of
clothes
and
after
a
light
luncheon
peer
carried
them
off
to
show
them
round
the
place
he
had
added
a
number
of
new
buildings
and
had
broken
new
land
the
farm
had
forty
cows
when
he
came
now
he
had
over
sixty
of
course
all
this
is
a
mere
nothing
for
fellows
like
you
who
bring
your
harvest
home
in
railway
trains
he
said
but
you
see
i
have
my
home
and
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
house
and
the
farmstead
round
later
they
drove
over
in
the
light
trap
to
look
at
the
workshop
and
here
he
made
no
excuses
for
its
being
small
he
showed
off
the
little
foundry
as
if
it
had
been
a
seat
of
industry
and
maintained
his
serious
air
while
his
companions
glanced
sideways
at
him
trying
hard
not
to
smile
the
workmen
touched
their
caps
respectfully
and
sent
curious
glances
at
the
strangers
quite
a
treat
to
see
things
on
the
norwegian
scale
again
ferdinand
holm
couldn
t
resist
saying
at
last
yes
isn
t
it
charming
cried
peer
putting
on
an
air
of
ingenuous
delight
this
is
just
the
size
a
foundry
should
be
if
its
owner
is
to
have
a
good
time
and
possess
his
soul
in
ferdinand
holm
and
brock
exchanged
glances
but
next
moment
peer
led
them
through
into
a
with
tools
and
machinery
evidently
having
no
connection
with
the
rest
now
look
out
said
klaus
this
is
the
holy
of
holies
you
ll
see
he
s
hard
at
it
working
out
some
new
devilry
here
or
i
m
a
peer
drew
aside
a
couple
of
tarpaulins
and
showed
them
a
mowing
machine
of
the
ordinary
type
and
beside
it
another
the
model
of
a
new
type
he
had
himself
devised
it
s
not
quite
finished
yet
he
said
but
i
ve
solved
the
main
problem
the
old
single
principle
was
clumsy
dragged
you
know
but
with
two
blades
a
pair
of
shears
so
to
speak
it
ll
work
much
and
he
gave
them
a
little
lecture
showing
how
much
simpler
his
mechanism
was
and
how
much
lighter
the
machine
would
be
and
there
you
are
said
klaus
it
s
columbus
s
egg
over
the
patent
ought
to
be
worth
a
million
said
ferdinand
holm
slowly
looking
out
of
the
window
of
course
the
main
thing
is
to
make
the
work
easier
and
cheaper
for
the
farmers
said
peer
with
a
rather
sly
glance
at
ferdinand
dinner
that
evening
was
a
festive
meal
when
the
liqueur
brandy
went
round
klaus
greeted
it
with
enthusiasm
why
here
s
an
old
friend
as
i
live
real
lysholmer
well
well
and
so
you
re
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
you
remember
the
days
when
we
were
boys
together
he
lifted
the
little
glass
and
watched
the
light
play
in
the
pale
spirit
and
the
three
old
friends
drank
together
singing
the
first
full
glass
and
then
the
second
little
nip
with
the
proper
ceremonial
observances
just
as
they
had
done
in
the
old
days
at
their
student
the
talk
went
merrily
one
good
story
calling
up
another
but
merle
could
not
help
noticing
the
steely
gleam
of
ferdinand
holm
s
eyes
even
when
he
laughed
the
talk
fell
on
new
doings
in
egypt
and
as
peer
heard
more
and
more
of
these
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
look
changed
his
glance
too
seemed
to
have
that
glint
of
steel
there
was
something
strange
and
absent
in
his
face
was
he
feeling
perhaps
that
wife
and
children
were
but
a
drag
on
a
man
after
all
he
seemed
like
an
old
waking
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
trumpets
there
s
a
nice
little
job
waiting
for
you
by
the
way
said
ferdinand
holm
lifting
his
glass
to
peer
very
kind
of
you
i
m
sure
a
under
you
you
re
no
good
under
any
one
you
belong
on
ferdinand
illustrated
his
words
with
a
downward
and
an
upward
pointing
of
the
finger
the
harnessing
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
will
have
to
be
taken
in
hand
it
s
only
a
question
of
thanks
very
much
said
peer
his
eyes
wide
open
now
the
plan
s
simply
lying
waiting
for
the
right
man
it
will
be
carried
out
it
may
be
next
year
it
may
be
in
ten
years
whenever
the
man
comes
along
i
would
think
about
it
if
i
were
all
looked
at
peer
merle
fastened
her
eyes
on
him
too
but
he
laughed
now
what
on
earth
would
be
the
satisfaction
to
me
of
binding
in
bands
those
two
ancient
and
honourable
rivers
well
in
the
first
place
it
would
mean
an
increase
of
many
millions
of
bushels
in
the
corn
production
of
the
world
wouldn
t
you
have
any
satisfaction
in
that
no
said
peer
with
a
touch
of
scorn
or
regular
lines
of
communication
over
hundreds
of
thousands
of
square
miles
of
the
most
fertile
country
on
the
globe
don
t
interest
me
said
peer
ah
ferdinand
holm
lifted
his
glass
to
merle
tell
me
dear
lady
how
does
it
feel
to
be
married
to
an
anachronism
to
to
what
stammered
merle
yes
your
husband
s
an
anachronism
he
might
if
he
chose
be
one
of
the
kings
the
prophets
who
lead
the
van
in
the
fight
for
civilisation
but
he
will
not
he
despises
his
own
powers
and
one
day
he
will
start
a
revolution
against
himself
mark
my
words
your
health
dear
lady
merle
laughed
and
lifted
her
glass
but
hesitatingly
and
with
a
towards
peer
yes
your
husband
is
no
better
now
than
an
egoist
a
collector
of
happy
well
and
is
that
so
very
wicked
he
sits
ravelling
out
his
life
into
a
multitude
of
golden
threads
went
on
ferdinand
with
a
bow
his
steely
eyes
trying
to
look
gentle
but
what
is
wrong
in
that
said
the
young
wife
stoutly
it
is
wrong
it
is
wasting
his
immortal
soul
a
man
has
no
right
to
ravel
out
his
life
even
though
the
threads
are
of
gold
a
man
s
days
of
personal
happiness
are
forgotten
his
work
endures
and
your
husband
in
particular
why
the
deuce
should
he
be
so
happy
the
uses
us
inexorably
either
for
light
or
for
fuel
and
peer
your
husband
dear
lady
is
too
good
for
merle
glanced
again
at
her
husband
peer
laughed
but
then
suddenly
compressed
his
lips
and
looked
down
at
his
plate
then
the
nurse
came
in
with
little
louise
to
say
and
the
child
was
handed
round
from
one
to
the
other
but
when
the
little
girl
came
to
ferdinand
holm
he
seemed
loth
to
touch
her
and
merle
read
his
glance
at
peer
as
meaning
here
is
another
of
the
bonds
you
ve
tied
yourself
up
excuse
me
he
said
suddenly
looking
at
his
watch
i
m
afraid
i
must
ask
for
the
use
of
the
telephone
again
pardon
me
fru
and
he
rose
and
left
the
room
klaus
looked
at
the
others
and
shook
his
head
that
man
would
simply
expire
if
he
couldn
t
send
a
telegram
once
an
hour
he
said
with
a
laugh
coffee
was
served
out
on
the
balcony
and
the
men
sat
and
smoked
it
was
a
dusky
twilight
of
early
autumn
the
hills
were
dark
blue
now
and
distant
there
was
a
scent
of
hay
and
garden
flowers
after
a
while
merle
rose
and
said
and
in
her
thoughts
when
she
found
herself
alone
in
her
bedroom
she
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
displeased
or
not
these
strange
men
were
drawing
peer
far
away
from
all
that
had
been
his
chief
delight
since
she
had
known
him
but
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
different
his
manner
was
towards
the
two
friends
klaus
brock
he
could
jest
and
laugh
with
but
with
ferdinand
holm
he
seemed
always
on
his
guard
ready
to
assert
himself
and
whenever
he
contradicted
him
it
was
always
with
a
certain
deference
the
great
yellow
disc
of
the
moon
came
up
over
the
hills
in
the
east
drawing
a
broad
pillar
of
gold
across
the
dark
water
and
the
three
comrades
on
the
balcony
sat
watching
it
for
a
while
in
silence
so
you
re
really
going
to
go
on
idling
here
asked
ferdinand
at
last
sipping
his
liqueur
is
it
me
you
mean
asked
peer
bending
slightly
forward
well
i
gather
you
re
going
round
here
simply
being
happy
from
morning
to
night
i
call
that
of
course
you
re
very
unhappy
in
reality
everyone
is
as
long
as
he
s
neglecting
his
powers
and
very
many
thanks
said
peer
with
a
laugh
klaus
sat
up
in
his
chair
a
little
anxious
as
to
what
was
coming
ferdinand
was
still
looking
out
over
the
lake
you
seem
to
despise
your
own
trade
as
engineer
yes
said
peer
and
why
why
i
feel
the
lack
of
some
touch
of
beauty
in
our
ceaseless
craving
to
create
something
new
something
new
always
something
new
more
gold
more
speed
more
food
are
these
things
not
all
we
are
driving
at
my
dear
fellow
gold
means
freedom
and
food
means
life
and
speed
carries
us
over
the
dead
moments
double
the
possibilities
of
life
for
men
and
you
double
their
and
what
good
will
it
do
to
double
their
numbers
two
thousand
million
souls
is
that
what
you
want
but
hang
it
all
man
put
in
klaus
brock
eagerly
think
of
our
dear
norway
at
least
surely
you
don
t
think
it
would
be
a
misfortune
if
our
population
increased
so
far
that
the
world
could
recognise
our
i
do
said
peer
looking
away
over
the
lake
ah
you
re
a
fanatic
for
the
small
in
size
and
in
i
am
loth
to
see
all
norway
polluted
with
factories
and
proletariat
armies
why
the
devil
can
t
we
be
left
in
peace
the
steel
will
not
have
it
said
ferdinand
holm
as
if
speaking
to
the
pillar
of
moonlight
on
the
water
what
who
did
you
say
peer
looked
at
him
with
wide
eyes
ferdinand
went
on
undisturbed
the
steel
will
not
have
peace
and
the
fire
will
not
and
prometheus
will
not
the
human
spirit
has
still
too
many
steps
to
climb
before
it
reaches
the
top
peace
no
my
friend
there
are
powers
outside
you
and
me
that
determine
these
peer
smiled
and
lit
a
new
cigar
ferdinand
holm
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
went
on
addressing
himself
apparently
to
the
moon
tigris
and
euphrates
indus
and
ganges
and
all
the
rest
of
this
planet
regulate
and
cultivate
the
whole
and
what
is
it
after
all
it
s
only
a
question
of
a
few
years
it
is
only
a
humble
beginning
in
a
couple
of
centuries
or
so
there
will
be
nothing
left
to
occupy
us
any
more
on
this
little
globe
of
ours
and
then
we
ll
have
to
set
about
colonising
other
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
peer
spoke
and
what
do
we
gain
by
it
all
he
asked
gain
do
you
imagine
there
will
ever
be
any
thus
far
and
no
farther
for
the
spirit
of
man
half
a
million
years
hence
all
the
solar
systems
we
know
of
now
will
be
regulated
and
ordered
by
the
human
spirit
there
will
be
difficulties
of
course
interplanetary
wars
will
arise
planetary
patriotism
groups
of
planetary
powers
in
alliances
and
coalitions
against
other
groups
little
worlds
will
be
subjugated
by
the
bigger
ones
and
so
on
is
there
anything
in
all
this
to
grow
dizzy
over
great
heavens
can
anyone
doubt
that
man
must
go
on
conquering
and
to
conquer
for
millions
of
years
to
come
the
goes
its
way
we
can
not
resist
nobody
asks
whether
we
are
happy
the
will
that
works
towards
the
infinite
asks
only
whom
it
can
use
for
its
ends
and
who
is
useless
viola
and
when
i
die
asked
peer
what
then
you
are
you
still
going
about
feeling
your
own
pulse
and
wanting
to
live
for
ever
my
dear
fellow
you
don
t
exist
there
is
just
one
person
on
our
side
the
and
that
includes
us
all
that
s
what
i
mean
by
and
we
are
working
towards
the
day
when
we
can
make
god
respect
us
in
good
earnest
the
spirit
of
man
will
hold
a
day
of
judgment
and
settle
accounts
with
olympus
with
the
riddle
the
almighty
power
beyond
it
will
be
a
great
reckoning
and
mark
my
words
that
is
the
one
single
religious
idea
that
lives
and
works
in
each
and
every
one
of
us
the
thing
that
makes
us
hold
up
our
heads
and
walk
upright
forgetting
that
we
are
slaves
and
things
that
suddenly
he
looked
at
his
watch
excuse
me
a
moment
if
the
telegraph
office
is
open
and
he
rose
and
went
in
when
he
returned
klaus
and
peer
were
talking
of
the
home
of
their
boyhood
and
their
early
days
together
remember
that
time
we
went
asked
klaus
oh
yes
that
shark
let
me
see
you
were
a
hero
weren
t
you
and
beat
it
to
death
with
your
bare
fists
wasn
t
that
it
and
then
cut
the
line
cut
the
line
and
row
for
your
lives
he
mimicked
and
burst
out
laughing
oh
shut
up
now
and
don
t
be
so
witty
said
klaus
but
tell
me
have
you
ever
been
back
there
since
you
came
home
peer
told
him
that
he
had
been
to
the
village
last
year
his
old
were
dead
and
peter
ronningen
too
but
martin
bruvold
was
there
still
living
in
a
tiny
cottage
with
eight
children
poor
devil
said
klaus
ferdinand
holm
had
sat
down
again
and
now
he
nodded
towards
the
moon
an
old
chum
of
yours
well
why
don
t
we
send
him
a
thousand
crowns
there
was
a
little
pause
i
hope
you
ll
let
me
join
you
went
on
ferdinand
taking
a
note
for
five
hundred
crowns
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
you
don
t
mind
do
you
peer
glanced
at
him
and
took
the
note
i
m
delighted
for
poor
old
martin
s
sake
he
said
putting
the
note
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
that
ll
make
fifteen
hundred
for
klaus
brock
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
smiled
a
little
the
talk
turned
on
other
things
for
a
while
and
then
he
asked
by
the
way
peer
have
you
seen
that
advertisement
of
the
british
carbide
company
s
no
what
about
they
want
tenders
for
the
damming
and
harnessing
of
the
besna
river
with
its
lake
system
and
falls
that
should
be
something
in
your
no
said
ferdinand
sharply
i
told
you
before
that
job
s
too
small
for
him
peer
s
going
to
the
what
would
it
amount
to
roughly
said
peer
addressing
no
one
in
particular
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
it
should
be
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
million
crowns
or
thereabout
said
klaus
that
s
not
a
thing
for
peer
said
ferdinand
rising
and
lifting
his
hand
to
hide
a
yawn
leave
trifles
like
that
to
the
trifling
souls
a
couple
of
hours
later
when
all
was
silent
throughout
the
house
peer
was
still
up
wandering
to
and
fro
in
soft
felt
slippers
in
the
great
hall
now
and
again
he
would
stop
and
look
out
of
the
window
why
could
he
not
sleep
the
moon
was
paling
the
day
beginning
to
dawn
chapter
viii
the
next
morning
merle
was
alone
in
the
pantry
when
she
heard
steps
behind
her
and
turned
her
head
it
was
klaus
brock
madam
ah
so
this
is
what
you
look
like
in
morning
dress
why
morning
neglige
might
have
been
invented
for
you
if
i
may
say
so
you
might
be
a
ghirlandajo
or
no
better
still
aspasia
you
are
up
early
said
merle
drily
am
i
what
about
ferdinand
holm
then
he
has
been
up
since
sunrise
sitting
over
his
letters
and
accounts
anything
i
can
help
you
with
may
i
move
that
cheese
for
you
well
well
you
are
strong
but
there
i
m
always
de
trop
where
women
are
always
de
trop
repeated
merle
watching
him
through
her
long
lashes
yes
my
first
and
only
love
do
you
know
who
she
was
no
indeed
how
should
i
well
it
was
louise
peer
s
little
sister
i
wish
you
could
have
known
and
since
then
merle
let
her
eyes
rest
on
this
flourishing
gentleman
who
looked
as
if
he
could
never
have
had
a
trouble
in
the
world
since
then
dear
lady
since
then
let
me
see
why
at
this
moment
i
really
can
t
remember
ever
having
met
any
other
woman
except
except
except
yourself
and
he
bowed
you
are
too
kind
and
that
being
so
don
t
you
think
it
s
your
plain
duty
as
a
hospitable
hostess
to
grant
me
grant
you
what
a
piece
of
cheese
why
no
thanks
something
better
something
much
better
than
what
then
a
kiss
i
might
as
well
have
it
as
he
took
a
step
nearer
she
looked
laughingly
round
for
a
way
of
escape
but
he
was
between
her
and
the
door
well
said
merle
but
you
must
do
something
to
make
yourself
useful
first
suppose
you
ran
up
that
for
delighted
why
this
is
great
fun
the
slight
wooden
ladder
creaked
under
the
weight
of
his
solid
form
as
he
climbed
how
high
am
i
to
go
to
reach
the
top
shelf
that
s
it
now
you
see
that
big
brown
jar
careful
it
s
splendid
i
do
believe
we
re
to
have
cranberry
preserve
at
by
standing
on
tiptoe
he
managed
to
reach
and
lift
the
heavy
jar
and
stood
holding
it
his
face
flushed
with
his
exertions
and
now
little
lady
just
stay
there
a
moment
and
hold
it
carefully
i
have
to
fetch
and
she
hurried
out
klaus
stood
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
holding
the
heavy
jar
he
looked
round
what
was
he
to
do
with
it
he
waited
for
merle
to
return
but
she
did
not
appear
someone
was
playing
the
piano
in
the
next
room
should
he
call
for
help
he
waited
on
getting
redder
and
redder
in
the
face
and
still
no
merle
came
with
another
mighty
effort
he
set
the
jar
back
in
its
place
and
then
climbed
down
the
ladder
and
walked
into
the
very
red
and
out
of
breath
in
the
doorway
he
stopped
short
and
stared
what
well
i
ll
and
she
s
sitting
here
playing
the
piano
yes
aren
t
you
fond
of
music
herr
brock
i
ll
pay
you
out
for
this
he
said
shaking
a
finger
at
her
just
you
wait
and
see
little
lady
if
i
don
t
pay
you
out
with
interest
and
he
turned
and
went
upstairs
chuckling
as
he
went
peer
was
sitting
at
the
in
his
study
when
klaus
came
in
i
m
just
sealing
up
the
letter
with
the
money
for
martin
bruvold
he
said
setting
the
taper
to
a
stick
of
sealing
wax
i
ve
signed
it
from
the
shark
yes
it
was
a
capital
idea
of
ferdinand
s
what
d
you
think
the
poor
old
fellow
ll
say
when
he
opens
it
and
the
big
notes
tumble
out
i
d
like
to
see
his
face
said
peer
as
he
wrote
the
address
on
the
envelope
klaus
dropped
into
a
leather
armchair
and
leaned
back
comfortably
i
ve
been
downstairs
flirting
a
little
with
your
wife
he
said
your
wife
s
a
wonder
peer
looked
at
him
and
thought
of
the
old
days
when
the
clumsy
doctor
s
son
had
run
about
after
the
in
the
town
he
had
still
something
of
his
old
lurching
walk
but
intercourse
with
the
ladies
of
many
lands
had
polished
him
and
given
lightness
and
ease
to
his
manner
what
was
i
going
to
say
klaus
went
on
oh
yes
our
friend
ferdinand
s
a
fine
fellow
isn
t
he
yes
i
felt
yesterday
exactly
as
i
used
to
feel
when
we
three
were
together
in
the
old
days
when
i
listen
to
his
talk
i
can
t
help
agreeing
with
him
and
then
you
begin
to
speak
and
what
you
say
too
seems
to
be
just
what
i
ve
been
thinking
in
my
inmost
soul
do
you
think
i
ve
become
shallow
peer
well
your
steam
ploughs
look
after
themselves
i
suppose
and
the
ladies
of
your
harem
don
t
trouble
you
overmuch
do
you
read
at
all
best
not
say
too
much
about
that
said
klaus
with
a
sigh
and
it
suddenly
struck
peer
that
his
friend
s
face
had
grown
older
and
more
worn
no
said
klaus
again
better
not
say
much
about
that
but
tell
me
old
fellow
you
mustn
t
mind
my
asking
has
ferdinand
ever
spoken
to
you
as
his
brother
or
peer
flushed
hotly
no
he
said
after
a
pause
no
i
owe
more
to
him
than
to
anybody
in
the
world
but
whether
he
regards
me
as
a
kinsman
or
simply
as
an
object
for
his
kindness
to
wreak
itself
on
is
a
matter
he
s
always
left
quite
it
s
just
like
him
he
s
a
queer
fellow
but
there
s
another
thing
well
said
peer
looking
up
it
s
er
again
it
s
rather
a
delicate
matter
to
touch
on
i
know
of
course
that
you
re
in
the
enviable
position
of
having
your
fortune
invested
in
the
best
company
in
the
world
yes
and
so
are
oh
mine
s
a
trifle
compared
with
yours
have
you
still
the
whole
of
your
money
in
ferdinand
s
company
yes
i
ve
been
thinking
of
selling
a
few
shares
by
the
way
as
you
may
suppose
i
ve
been
spending
a
good
deal
just
lately
more
than
my
you
mustn
t
sell
just
now
peer
they
re
i
daresay
you
ve
seen
that
they
re
down
below
par
in
what
below
par
no
i
had
no
idea
of
oh
only
for
the
time
being
of
course
just
a
temporary
drop
there
s
sure
to
be
another
run
on
them
soon
and
they
ll
go
up
again
but
the
khedive
has
the
controlling
interest
you
know
and
he
s
rather
a
ticklish
customer
ferdinand
is
all
for
extension
wants
to
keep
on
buying
up
new
land
new
desert
that
is
irrigation
there
s
just
a
question
of
power
that
s
how
he
looks
at
it
and
of
course
the
bigger
the
scale
of
the
work
the
cheaper
the
power
will
work
out
but
the
khedive
s
holding
back
it
may
be
just
a
temporary
whim
may
be
all
right
again
but
you
never
know
and
if
you
think
ferdinand
s
the
man
to
give
in
to
a
cranky
khedive
you
re
much
mistaken
his
idea
now
is
to
raise
all
the
capital
he
can
lay
hands
on
and
buy
him
out
what
do
you
say
to
that
buy
the
khedive
clean
out
of
the
company
it
s
a
large
order
and
if
i
were
you
old
man
as
soon
as
the
shares
go
up
again
a
bit
i
d
sell
out
some
of
my
holding
and
put
the
money
into
something
at
home
here
after
all
there
must
be
plenty
of
quite
useful
things
to
be
had
peer
frowned
and
sat
for
a
while
looking
straight
before
him
no
he
said
at
last
as
things
stand
between
ferdinand
holm
and
me
well
if
either
of
us
goes
back
on
the
other
it
s
not
going
to
be
ah
in
that
case
i
beg
your
pardon
said
klaus
and
he
rose
and
departed
the
christening
was
a
great
occasion
with
a
houseful
of
guests
and
a
great
deal
of
speechmaking
the
host
was
the
youngest
and
gayest
of
the
party
the
birth
of
his
son
should
be
celebrated
in
true
ethiopian
fashion
he
declared
with
bonfires
and
boating
parties
the
moon
was
hidden
that
evening
behind
thick
dark
clouds
but
the
boats
full
of
guests
glided
over
the
black
water
to
the
accompaniment
of
music
and
laughter
the
young
madcap
of
a
lawyer
was
there
again
sitting
on
the
lap
of
someone
else
s
wife
and
playing
a
concertina
till
people
in
the
farms
on
shore
opened
their
windows
and
put
their
heads
out
to
listen
later
on
the
bonfires
blazed
up
all
along
the
lake
shore
and
shone
like
great
flaming
suns
in
the
water
below
the
guests
lay
on
the
grass
in
little
groups
round
picnic
suppers
and
here
and
there
a
couple
wandered
by
themselves
talking
in
whispers
merle
and
peer
stood
together
for
a
moment
beside
one
of
the
bonfires
their
faces
and
figures
were
lit
by
the
red
glow
they
looked
at
each
other
and
exchanged
a
smile
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
outside
the
circle
of
light
from
the
fire
and
pointed
over
to
their
home
with
all
its
windows
glowing
against
the
dark
suppose
this
should
be
the
last
party
we
give
peer
what
makes
you
say
that
oh
nothing
only
i
have
a
sort
of
feeling
as
if
something
had
just
ended
and
something
new
was
to
begin
i
feel
like
it
somehow
but
i
wanted
to
thank
you
too
for
all
the
happy
times
we
ve
but
peer
what
she
got
no
farther
for
peer
had
already
left
her
and
joined
a
group
of
guests
where
he
was
soon
as
gay
as
the
rest
then
came
the
day
when
the
two
visitors
were
to
leave
their
birthday
gift
to
the
young
gentleman
so
lately
christened
lorentz
uthoug
stood
in
the
it
was
a
bust
in
red
granite
the
height
of
a
man
of
the
re
hormachis
brought
with
them
by
the
godfathers
from
alexandria
and
now
it
sat
in
the
between
palms
in
pots
pressing
its
elbows
against
its
sides
and
gazing
with
great
dead
eyes
out
into
endless
space
peer
stood
on
the
quay
waving
farewell
to
his
old
comrades
as
the
steamer
ploughed
through
the
water
drawing
after
it
a
trail
of
little
waves
and
when
he
came
home
he
walked
about
the
place
looking
at
farms
and
woods
at
merle
and
the
children
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
her
strange
and
new
next
night
he
stayed
up
once
more
alone
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
great
hall
and
looking
out
of
the
windows
into
the
dark
was
he
ravelling
out
his
life
into
golden
threads
that
vanished
and
were
forgotten
was
he
content
to
be
fuel
instead
of
light
what
was
he
seeking
happiness
and
beyond
it
as
a
boy
he
had
called
it
the
anthem
the
universal
hymn
what
was
it
now
god
but
he
would
hardly
find
him
in
idleness
you
have
drawn
such
nourishment
as
you
could
from
joy
in
your
home
from
your
marriage
your
fatherhood
nature
and
the
fellowmen
around
you
here
there
are
unused
faculties
in
you
that
hunger
for
exercise
that
long
to
be
set
free
to
work
to
strive
to
act
you
should
take
up
the
barrage
on
the
besna
peer
but
could
you
get
the
contract
if
you
once
in
earnest
no
one
is
likely
to
beat
you
you
ll
get
it
sure
enough
but
do
you
really
want
it
are
you
not
working
away
at
a
as
it
is
better
own
up
that
you
can
t
get
on
without
your
old
craft
after
all
that
you
must
for
ever
be
messing
and
meddling
with
steel
and
fire
you
can
t
help
yourself
all
the
things
your
eyes
have
been
fixed
on
in
these
last
years
have
been
only
golden
visions
in
a
mist
the
steel
has
its
own
will
the
steel
is
beginning
to
wake
in
you
singing
singing
bent
on
pressing
onward
you
have
no
choice
the
goes
on
its
way
go
with
it
or
be
cast
overboard
as
useless
and
still
peer
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
next
morning
he
set
off
for
the
capital
merle
watched
the
carriage
as
it
drove
away
and
thought
to
herself
he
was
right
something
new
is
chapter
ix
there
came
a
card
from
peer
with
a
brief
message
off
to
inspect
the
a
fortnight
later
he
came
home
loaded
with
maps
and
plans
of
course
i
m
late
for
the
fair
as
usual
he
said
but
wait
a
he
locked
himself
into
his
room
at
last
merle
knew
what
it
was
like
to
have
him
at
work
she
could
hear
him
in
the
mornings
walking
up
and
down
and
whistling
then
silence
he
would
be
standing
over
his
table
busy
with
notes
and
figures
then
steps
again
now
he
was
singing
and
this
was
a
novelty
to
himself
it
was
as
if
he
carried
in
him
a
store
of
happiness
a
treasure
laid
by
of
love
and
the
beauty
of
nature
and
happy
hours
and
now
it
found
its
way
out
in
song
why
should
he
not
sing
over
the
plans
for
a
great
barrage
mathematics
are
dry
work
enough
but
at
times
they
can
be
as
living
visions
soaring
up
into
the
light
peer
sang
louder
then
silence
again
merle
never
knew
now
when
he
stopped
work
and
came
to
bed
she
would
fall
asleep
to
the
sound
of
his
singing
in
his
own
room
and
when
she
woke
he
would
already
be
tramping
up
and
down
again
in
there
and
to
her
his
steps
seemed
like
the
imperious
tread
of
a
great
commander
he
was
alight
with
new
visions
new
themes
and
his
voice
had
a
lordly
ring
merle
looked
at
him
through
eyes
with
a
lingering
glance
once
more
he
was
new
to
her
she
had
never
seen
him
like
this
at
last
the
work
was
finished
and
he
sent
in
his
tender
and
now
he
was
more
restless
than
ever
for
a
week
he
waited
for
an
answer
tramping
in
and
out
of
the
place
going
off
for
rides
on
bijou
and
coming
back
with
his
horse
dripping
with
sweat
an
impatient
man
can
not
possibly
ride
at
any
pace
but
a
gallop
the
days
passed
peer
was
sleepless
and
ate
nothing
more
days
passed
at
last
he
came
bursting
into
the
nursery
one
morning
trunk
call
merle
summons
to
a
meeting
of
the
company
directors
quick
s
the
word
come
and
help
me
pack
and
in
no
time
he
was
off
again
to
the
city
now
it
was
merle
s
turn
to
walk
up
and
down
in
suspense
it
mattered
little
to
her
in
itself
whether
he
got
the
work
or
not
but
she
was
keenly
anxious
that
he
should
win
a
couple
of
days
later
a
telegram
came
hurrah
wife
and
merle
danced
round
the
room
waving
the
telegram
above
her
head
the
next
day
he
was
back
home
again
and
tramping
up
and
down
the
room
what
do
you
think
your
father
will
say
to
it
merle
ha
father
say
to
what
when
i
ask
him
to
be
my
surety
for
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
crowns
is
father
to
be
in
it
too
merle
looked
at
him
oh
if
he
doesn
t
want
to
we
ll
let
him
off
but
at
any
rate
i
ll
ask
him
first
and
peer
drove
off
into
town
in
lorentz
uthoug
s
big
house
you
had
to
pass
through
the
hardware
shop
to
get
to
his
office
which
lay
behind
peer
knocked
at
the
door
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
herr
uthoug
had
just
lit
the
gas
and
was
on
the
point
of
sitting
down
at
his
american
desk
when
peer
entered
the
head
with
the
close
thick
hair
turned
towards
him
darkened
by
the
shadow
from
the
green
shade
of
the
burner
you
is
it
said
he
sit
down
you
ve
been
to
christiania
i
hear
and
what
are
you
busy
with
now
they
sat
down
opposite
each
other
peer
explained
calmly
and
with
confidence
and
what
does
the
thing
amount
to
asked
uthoug
his
face
coming
out
of
the
shadow
and
looking
at
peer
in
the
full
light
two
million
four
hundred
the
old
man
laid
his
hairy
hands
on
the
desk
and
rose
to
his
feet
staring
at
the
other
and
breathing
deeply
the
sum
him
beside
it
he
himself
and
his
work
seemed
like
dust
in
the
balance
where
were
all
his
plans
and
achievements
now
his
greatness
his
position
his
authority
in
the
town
compared
with
amounts
like
this
what
were
the
paltry
sums
he
had
been
used
to
handle
i
i
didn
t
quite
catch
he
stammered
did
you
say
two
millions
yes
i
daresay
it
seems
a
trifle
to
you
said
peer
indeed
i
ve
handled
contracts
myself
that
ran
to
fifty
million
what
how
much
did
you
say
uthoug
began
to
move
restlessly
about
the
room
he
clutched
his
hair
and
gazed
at
peer
as
if
doubting
whether
he
was
quite
sober
at
the
same
time
he
felt
it
would
never
do
to
let
himself
be
so
easily
thrown
off
his
balance
he
tried
to
pull
himself
together
and
what
do
you
make
out
of
it
he
asked
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
i
oh
a
profit
on
this
scale
again
rather
startled
the
old
man
no
he
was
nothing
he
never
had
been
anything
in
this
world
how
do
you
know
that
you
will
make
so
much
i
ve
calculated
it
all
but
if
but
how
can
you
be
sure
of
it
suppose
you
ve
got
your
figures
wrong
his
head
was
thrust
forward
again
into
the
full
light
i
m
in
the
habit
of
getting
my
figures
right
said
peer
when
he
broached
the
question
of
security
the
old
man
was
in
the
act
of
moving
away
from
him
across
the
room
but
he
stopped
short
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
what
security
you
want
me
to
stand
security
for
two
million
crowns
no
the
company
asks
for
a
guarantee
for
four
hundred
after
a
pause
the
old
man
said
i
see
yes
i
see
but
but
i
m
not
worth
as
much
as
that
i
can
put
in
three
hundred
thousand
of
the
four
myself
in
shares
and
then
of
course
i
have
the
loreng
property
and
the
works
but
put
it
at
a
round
figure
will
you
guarantee
a
hundred
thousand
there
was
another
pause
and
then
the
reply
came
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
to
which
uthoug
had
drifted
even
that
s
a
big
of
course
if
you
would
rather
not
i
could
make
other
arrangements
my
two
friends
who
have
just
been
here
he
rose
and
began
to
gather
up
his
papers
no
no
you
mustn
t
be
in
such
a
hurry
why
you
come
down
on
a
man
like
an
avalanche
you
must
give
me
time
to
think
it
over
till
at
least
and
the
papers
at
any
rate
i
must
have
a
look
at
uthoug
passed
a
restless
and
troubled
night
the
solid
ground
seemed
to
have
failed
him
his
mind
could
find
no
firm
foothold
his
must
be
a
great
man
he
should
be
the
last
to
doubt
it
but
a
hundred
thousand
to
be
ventured
not
in
landed
property
or
a
big
trade
deal
but
on
the
success
of
a
piece
of
construction
work
this
was
something
new
it
seemed
fantastic
suited
to
the
great
world
outside
perhaps
or
the
future
had
he
courage
enough
to
stand
in
who
could
tell
what
accidents
what
disasters
might
not
happen
no
he
shook
his
head
he
could
not
he
dared
not
but
the
thing
tempted
him
he
had
always
wanted
to
be
something
more
than
a
whale
among
the
minnows
should
he
risk
it
should
he
not
it
meant
staking
his
whole
fortune
his
position
everything
upon
the
outcome
of
a
piece
of
engineering
that
he
understood
nothing
whatever
about
it
was
sheer
speculation
it
was
gambling
no
he
must
say
no
then
he
was
only
a
whale
among
the
minnows
after
all
no
he
must
say
yes
good
god
he
clenched
his
hands
together
they
were
clammy
with
sweat
and
his
brain
was
in
a
whirl
it
was
a
trial
a
temptation
he
felt
an
impulse
to
pray
but
what
good
could
that
do
since
he
had
himself
abolished
god
next
day
merle
and
peer
were
rung
up
by
telephone
and
asked
to
come
in
to
dinner
with
the
old
folks
but
when
they
were
all
sitting
at
table
they
found
it
impossible
to
keep
the
conversation
going
everyone
seemed
shy
of
beginning
on
the
subject
they
were
all
thinking
about
the
old
man
s
face
was
grey
with
want
of
sleep
his
wife
looked
from
one
to
the
other
through
her
spectacles
peer
was
calm
and
smiling
at
last
when
the
claret
came
round
fru
uthoug
lifted
her
glass
and
drank
to
peer
good
fortune
she
said
we
won
t
be
the
ones
to
stand
in
your
way
since
you
think
it
is
all
right
of
course
it
is
and
we
all
hope
it
will
turn
out
well
for
you
merle
looked
at
her
parents
she
had
sat
through
the
meal
anxious
and
troubled
and
now
the
tears
rose
into
her
eyes
thanks
said
peer
lifting
his
glass
and
drinking
to
his
host
and
hostess
thanks
he
repeated
bowing
to
old
uthoug
the
matter
was
arranged
evidently
the
two
old
folks
had
talked
it
over
together
and
come
to
an
agreement
it
was
settled
but
all
four
felt
as
if
the
solid
ground
were
rocking
a
little
under
their
feet
all
their
future
their
fate
seemed
staked
upon
a
throw
a
couple
of
days
later
a
day
of
mild
october
sunshine
peer
happened
to
go
into
the
town
and
catching
sight
of
his
at
the
window
he
went
off
and
bought
some
flowers
and
took
them
up
to
her
she
was
sitting
looking
out
at
the
yellow
sky
in
the
west
and
she
hardly
turned
her
head
as
she
took
the
flowers
thanks
peer
she
said
and
continued
gazing
out
at
the
sky
what
are
you
thinking
of
dear
mother
asked
peer
ah
it
isn
t
a
good
thing
always
to
tell
our
thoughts
she
said
and
she
turned
her
spectacled
eyes
so
as
to
look
out
over
the
lake
i
hope
it
was
something
pleasant
i
was
thinking
of
you
peer
of
you
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
think
of
you
see
peer
there
is
trouble
coming
for
you
a
great
deal
of
she
nodded
her
head
towards
the
yellow
sky
in
the
west
trouble
why
why
should
trouble
come
to
us
because
you
are
happy
what
because
i
am
because
all
things
blossom
and
flourish
about
you
be
sure
that
there
are
unseen
powers
enough
that
grudge
you
your
peer
smiled
you
think
so
he
asked
i
know
it
she
answered
with
a
sigh
gazing
out
into
the
distance
you
have
made
enemies
of
late
amongst
all
those
envious
shadows
that
none
can
see
but
they
are
all
around
us
i
see
them
every
day
i
have
learned
to
know
them
in
all
these
years
i
have
fought
with
them
and
it
is
well
for
merle
that
she
has
learned
to
sing
in
a
house
so
full
of
shadows
god
grant
she
may
be
able
to
sing
them
away
from
you
when
peer
left
the
house
he
felt
as
if
little
shudders
of
cold
were
passing
down
his
back
pooh
he
exclaimed
as
he
reached
the
street
she
is
not
right
in
her
and
he
hurried
to
his
carriole
and
drove
off
home
old
rode
will
be
pleased
anyhow
he
thought
he
ll
be
his
own
master
in
the
workshop
now
the
dream
of
his
life
well
everyone
for
himself
and
the
bailiff
will
have
things
all
his
own
way
at
loreng
for
a
year
or
two
well
well
come
up
brownie
chapter
x
peer

now

mustn
t

won
t
leave
me
alone
peer
merle
dear
now
do
be
sensible
no
no
do
let
go
he
tried
to
disengage
her
hands
that
were
clasped
behind
his
neck
peer
you
have
never
been
like
this
before
don
t
you
care
for
me
any
more
or
the
children
merle
dearest
you
don
t
imagine
that
i
like
going
but
you
surely
don
t
want
me
to
have
another
big
breach
this
year
it
would
be
sheer
ruin
i
do
assure
you
come
come
now
let
me
but
she
held
him
fast
and
what
happens
to
those
dams
up
there
is
more
to
you
now
than
what
becomes
of
me
you
will
be
all
right
dear
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
have
promised
to
be
on
the
spot
the
moment
you
send
word
and
you
managed
so
well
before
i
simply
can
not
stay
now
merle
there
s
too
much
at
stake
there
there
goodbye
be
sure
you
telegraph
he
kissed
her
over
the
eyes
put
her
gently
down
into
a
chair
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
feeling
her
terrified
glance
follow
him
as
he
went
the
april
sun
had
cleared
away
the
snow
from
the
lowlands
but
when
peer
stepped
out
of
the
train
up
in
espedal
he
found
himself
back
in
winter
farms
and
fields
still
covered
and
ridges
and
peaks
deep
in
white
dazzling
snow
and
soon
he
was
sitting
wrapped
in
his
furs
driving
a
miserable
dun
pony
up
a
that
led
out
on
to
the
uplands
the
road
was
a
narrow
track
through
the
snow
yellow
with
and
a
mass
of
holes
and
ruts
worn
by
his
own
teams
that
had
hauled
their
heavy
loads
of
cement
this
way
all
through
that
winter
and
the
last
up
to
the
plateau
and
across
the
frozen
lakes
to
besna
the
steel
will
on
the
steel
cares
nothing
for
human
beings
merle
must
come
through
it
alone
when
a
healthy
happy
man
is
hampered
and
thwarted
in
a
great
work
by
annoyances
and
disasters
he
behaves
like
an
arab
horse
on
a
heavy
march
at
first
it
moves
at
a
brisk
trot
uphill
and
downhill
and
it
goes
faster
and
faster
as
its
strength
begins
to
flag
and
when
at
last
it
is
thoroughly
out
of
breath
and
ready
to
drop
it
breaks
into
an
easy
gallop
this
was
not
the
work
he
had
once
dreamed
of
finding
now
as
before
his
hunger
for
eternal
things
seemed
ever
at
the
side
of
his
accomplishment
asking
continually
whither
why
and
what
then
but
by
degrees
the
difficulties
had
multiplied
and
mounted
till
at
last
his
whole
mind
was
taken
up
by
the
one
thought
to
put
it
through
good
or
bad
in
itself
he
must
make
a
success
of
it
he
had
undertaken
it
and
he
must
see
it
through
he
must
not
be
beaten
and
so
he
fought
on
it
was
merely
a
trial
of
strength
a
fight
with
material
difficulties
aye
but
was
that
all
it
was
were
there
not
times
when
he
felt
himself
struggling
with
something
greater
something
worse
a
new
motive
force
seemed
to
have
come
into
his
life
misfortune
a
power
outside
his
own
will
had
begun
to
play
tricks
with
him
your
calculations
may
be
sound
correct
in
every
detail
and
yet
things
may
go
altogether
wrong
who
could
include
in
his
calculations
the
chance
that
a
perfectly
sober
engineer
will
get
drunk
one
day
and
give
orders
so
crazy
that
it
costs
tens
of
thousands
to
repair
the
damage
who
could
foresee
that
against
all
probability
a
big
vein
of
water
would
be
tapped
in
tunnelling
and
would
burst
out
flooding
the
workings
and
overwhelming
the
workmen
so
that
the
next
day
a
train
of
unpainted
deal
coffins
goes
winding
out
over
the
frozen
lakes
more
than
once
there
had
been
remarks
and
questions
in
the
newspapers
another
disaster
at
the
besna
falls
who
is
to
blame
it
was
because
he
himself
was
away
on
a
business
journey
and
falkman
had
neglected
to
take
elementary
precautions
that
the
big
occurred
in
the
tunnel
killing
four
men
and
destroying
the
new
belgian
that
had
cost
a
good
hundred
thousand
before
it
had
begun
to
work
this
sort
of
thing
was
not
faulty
calculation
it
was
malicious
fate
come
up
boy
we
must
get
there
the
flood
mustn
t
have
a
chance
this
year
to
lay
the
blame
on
me
because
i
wasn
t
on
the
and
then
to
cap
the
other
misfortunes
his
chief
contractor
for
material
had
gone
bankrupt
and
now
prices
had
risen
far
above
the
rates
he
had
allowed
for
adding
fresh
thousands
to
the
extra
expenditure
but
he
would
put
the
thing
through
even
if
he
lost
money
by
it
his
envious
rivals
who
had
lately
begun
to
run
down
his
projects
in
the
technical
papers
he
would
make
them
look
foolish
yet
and
then
well
it
may
be
that
the
promethean
spirit
is
preparing
a
settling
day
for
the
universe
somewhere
out
in
infinity
but
what
concern
is
that
of
mine
what
about
my
own
immortal
soul
silence
push
on
push
on
there
may
be
a
snowstorm
any
minute
come
up
get
along
you
scarecrow
the
dun
struggles
on
to
the
end
of
a
stage
and
then
the
valley
ends
and
the
full
blast
from
the
plateau
meets
them
here
lies
the
posting
station
the
last
farm
in
the
valley
he
swings
into
the
yard
and
is
soon
sitting
in
the
room
over
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
pipe
merle
how
are
things
with
merle
now
ah
here
comes
his
own
horse
the
big
black
stallion
from
gudbrandsdal
this
beast
s
trot
is
a
different
thing
from
the
poor
dun
s
the
sleigh
flies
up
to
the
door
and
in
a
moment
peer
is
sitting
in
it
again
in
his
furs
ah
what
a
relief
to
have
a
fresh
horse
and
one
that
makes
light
of
the
load
behind
him
away
he
goes
at
a
brisk
trot
with
lifted
head
and
bells
jingling
over
the
frozen
lakes
here
and
there
on
the
hillslopes
a
grey
hut
or
two
show
out
saeters
which
have
lain
there
unchanged
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
thousand
years
but
a
new
time
is
coming
the
will
be
heard
no
longer
and
the
song
of
the
turbines
will
rise
in
their
place
an
icy
wind
is
blowing
the
horse
throws
up
its
head
and
snorts
big
snowflakes
come
driving
on
the
wind
and
soon
a
regular
snowstorm
is
raging
lashing
the
traveller
s
face
till
he
gasps
first
the
horse
s
mane
and
tail
grow
white
with
snow
then
its
whole
body
the
drifts
grow
bigger
the
black
has
to
make
great
bounds
to
clear
them
bravo
old
boy
we
must
get
there
before
dark
there
are
brushwood
brooms
set
out
across
the
ice
to
mark
the
way
but
who
could
keep
them
in
sight
in
a
driving
smother
like
this
peer
s
own
face
is
plastered
white
now
and
he
feels
stunned
and
dazed
under
the
lash
of
the
snow
he
has
worked
under
the
burning
suns
of
egypt
and
now
here
but
the
steel
will
on
the
wave
rolls
on
its
way
over
all
the
world
if
this
snow
should
turn
to
rain
now
it
will
mean
a
flood
and
then
the
men
will
have
to
turn
out
and
work
to
save
the
dams
one
more
disaster
and
he
would
hardly
be
able
to
finish
within
the
contract
time
and
that
once
exceeded
each
day
s
delay
means
a
penalty
of
a
thousand
crowns
it
is
getting
darker
at
last
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
on
the
way
but
a
shapeless
mass
of
snow
struggling
with
bowed
head
against
the
storm
wading
deep
in
the
loose
drifts
wading
seemingly
at
haphazard
and
trailing
after
it
an
indefinable
bundle
of
white
dead
white
behind
a
human
being
drags
along
holding
on
for
dear
life
to
the
rings
on
the
sleigh
it
is
the
from
the
last
stage
at
last
they
were
groping
their
way
in
the
darkness
towards
the
shore
where
the
electric
lights
of
the
station
showed
faintly
through
the
and
hardly
had
peer
got
out
of
the
sleigh
before
the
snow
stopped
suddenly
and
the
dazzling
electric
suns
shone
over
the
place
with
the
workmen
s
barracks
the
assistants
quarters
the
offices
and
his
own
little
house
two
of
the
engineers
came
out
to
meet
him
and
saluted
respectfully
well
how
is
everything
getting
on
the
greybeard
answered
the
men
have
struck
work
struck
what
for
they
want
us
to
take
back
the
machinist
that
was
dismissed
the
other
day
for
peer
shook
the
snow
from
his
fur
coat
took
his
bag
and
walked
over
to
the
building
the
others
following
then
we
ll
have
to
take
him
back
he
said
we
can
t
afford
a
strike
a
couple
of
days
later
peer
was
lying
in
bed
when
the
was
brought
in
he
shook
the
letters
out
over
the
coverlet
and
caught
sight
of
one
from
klaus
brook
what
was
this
why
did
his
hand
tremble
as
he
took
it
up
of
course
it
was
only
one
of
klaus
s
ordinary
friendly
letters
dear
friend
this
is
a
hard
letter
to
write
but
i
do
hope
you
have
taken
my
advice
and
got
some
of
your
money
at
any
rate
over
to
norway
well
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
ferdinand
holm
has
decamped
or
is
in
prison
or
possibly
worse
you
know
well
enough
it
s
no
good
asking
questions
in
a
country
like
this
when
a
big
man
suddenly
disappears
he
had
made
enemies
in
the
highest
places
he
was
playing
a
dangerous
game
and
this
is
the
end
of
it
you
know
what
it
means
when
a
business
goes
into
liquidation
out
here
and
no
strong
man
on
the
spot
to
look
after
things
we
europeans
can
whistle
for
our
share
you
ll
take
it
coolly
i
know
i
ve
lost
every
penny
i
had
but
you
ve
still
got
your
place
over
there
and
the
workshops
and
you
re
the
sort
of
fellow
to
make
twice
as
much
next
time
or
i
don
t
know
you
i
hope
the
besna
barrage
is
to
be
a
success
yours
ever
klaus
brock
of
course
you
ll
understand
that
now
my
friend
has
been
thrown
overboard
it
will
very
likely
be
my
turn
next
but
i
can
t
leave
now
to
try
would
rouse
suspicion
at
once
we
foreigners
have
some
difficult
balancing
to
do
to
escape
a
fall
well
if
by
chance
you
don
t
hear
from
me
again
you
ll
know
something
has
happened
outside
the
water
was
streaming
down
the
channels
into
the
fall
peer
lay
still
for
a
while
only
one
knee
moving
up
and
down
beneath
the
clothes
he
thought
of
his
two
friends
and
he
thought
that
he
was
now
a
poor
man
and
that
the
greater
part
of
the
burden
of
the
security
would
fall
now
on
old
lorentz
uthoug
clearly
fate
has
other
business
on
hand
than
making
things
easy
for
you
peer
you
must
fight
your
fight
out
chapter
xi
one
evening
in
the
late
autumn
merle
was
sitting
at
home
waiting
for
her
husband
he
had
been
away
for
several
weeks
so
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
make
a
little
festivity
of
his
return
the
lamps
were
lit
in
all
the
rooms
wood
fires
were
crackling
in
all
the
stoves
the
cook
was
busy
with
his
favourite
dishes
and
little
louise
now
five
years
old
had
on
her
blue
velvet
frock
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
nursing
two
dolls
and
chattering
to
them
mind
you
re
a
good
girl
now
josephine
your
grandpa
will
be
here
merle
looked
in
through
the
kitchen
door
have
you
brought
up
the
claret
bertha
that
s
right
you
d
better
put
it
near
the
stove
to
then
she
went
round
all
the
rooms
again
the
two
youngest
children
were
in
bed
was
there
anything
more
to
be
done
it
would
be
an
hour
at
least
before
he
could
be
here
yet
she
could
not
help
listening
all
the
time
for
the
sound
of
wheels
but
she
had
not
finished
yet
she
hurried
up
to
the
bathroom
turned
on
the
hot
water
undressed
and
put
on
an
oilskin
cap
to
keep
her
hair
dry
and
soon
she
was
splashing
about
with
soap
and
sponge
why
not
make
herself
as
attractive
as
she
could
even
if
things
did
look
dark
for
them
just
now
a
little
stream
of
talk
went
on
in
her
brain
strange
that
one
s
body
could
be
so
great
a
pleasure
to
another
here
he
kissed
you
and
here
and
here
and
often
he
seemed
beside
himself
with
joy
and
do
you
remember
that
time
you
held
back
and
were
cold
often
perhaps
too
often
is
it
too
late
now
ah
he
has
other
things
to
think
of
now
the
time
is
gone
by
when
you
could
be
comfort
enough
to
him
in
all
troubles
but
is
it
quite
gone
by
oh
yes
last
time
he
came
home
he
hardly
seemed
to
notice
that
we
had
a
new
little
girl
that
he
had
never
seen
before
well
no
doubt
it
must
be
so
he
did
not
complain
and
he
was
calm
and
quiet
but
his
mind
was
full
of
a
whole
world
of
serious
things
a
world
where
there
was
no
room
for
wife
and
children
will
it
be
the
same
this
evening
again
will
he
notice
that
you
have
dressed
so
carefully
to
please
him
will
it
be
a
joy
to
him
any
more
to
feel
his
arms
around
you
she
stood
in
front
of
the
big
mirror
and
looked
critically
at
herself
no
she
was
no
longer
young
as
she
had
been
the
red
in
her
cheeks
had
faded
a
little
these
last
few
years
and
there
were
one
or
two
wrinkles
that
could
not
be
hidden
but
her
eyebrows
he
had
loved
to
kiss
them
once
they
were
surely
much
as
before
and
involuntarily
she
bent
towards
the
glass
and
stroked
the
dark
growth
above
her
eyes
as
if
it
were
his
hand
caressing
her
she
came
down
at
last
dressed
in
a
loose
blue
dress
with
a
broad
lace
collar
and
blond
lace
in
the
wide
sleeves
and
not
to
seem
too
much
dressed
she
had
put
on
a
apron
to
give
herself
a
housewifely
look
it
was
past
seven
now
louise
came
whimpering
to
her
and
merle
sank
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
took
the
child
on
her
lap
and
waited
the
sound
of
wheels
in
the
night
may
mean
the
approach
of
fate
itself
some
decision
some
final
word
that
casts
us
down
in
a
moment
from
wealth
to
ruin
who
knows
peer
had
been
to
england
now
trying
to
come
to
some
arrangement
with
the
company
sh
was
that
not
wheels
she
rose
trembling
and
listened
no
it
had
passed
on
it
was
eight
o
clock
now
time
for
louise
to
go
to
bed
and
merle
began
undressing
her
soon
the
child
was
lying
in
her
little
white
bed
with
a
doll
on
either
side
give
papa
a
tiss
she
babbled
and
give
him
my
love
and
mama
do
you
think
he
ll
let
me
come
into
his
bed
for
a
bit
tomorrow
morning
oh
yes
i
m
sure
he
will
and
now
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
there
s
a
good
merle
sat
down
again
in
the
room
and
waited
but
at
last
she
rose
put
on
a
cloak
and
went
out
the
town
lay
down
there
in
the
autumn
darkness
under
a
mist
of
light
and
over
the
black
hills
all
around
rose
a
world
of
stars
somewhere
out
there
was
peer
far
out
maybe
upon
some
country
road
the
horse
plodding
on
through
the
dark
at
its
own
will
its
master
sitting
with
bowed
head
brooding
help
us
thou
above
and
help
him
most
he
has
had
so
much
adversity
in
these
last
but
the
starry
vault
seems
icy
cold
it
has
heard
the
prayers
of
millions
and
millions
before
the
hearts
of
men
are
nothing
to
the
universe
merle
drooped
her
head
and
went
in
again
to
the
house
it
was
midnight
when
peer
drove
up
the
hill
towards
his
home
the
sight
of
the
great
house
with
its
brilliantly
lighted
windows
jarred
so
cruelly
on
his
wearied
mind
that
he
involuntarily
gave
the
horse
a
cut
with
his
whip
he
flung
the
reins
to
the
who
had
come
out
with
a
lantern
and
walked
up
the
steps
moving
almost
with
a
feeling
of
awe
in
this
great
house
as
if
it
already
belonged
to
someone
else
he
opened
the
door
of
the
no
one
there
but
light
light
and
comfort
he
passed
through
into
the
next
room
and
there
sat
merle
alone
in
an
armchair
with
her
head
resting
on
the
arm
asleep
had
she
been
waiting
so
long
a
wave
of
warmth
passed
through
him
he
stood
still
looking
at
her
and
presently
her
bowed
figure
slowly
straightened
her
pale
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
without
waking
her
he
went
on
into
the
nursery
where
the
lights
were
still
burning
but
here
the
lights
shone
only
on
three
little
ones
lying
in
their
clean
asleep
he
went
back
to
the
more
lights
and
a
table
laid
for
two
a
snowy
cloth
and
flowers
and
a
single
carnation
stuck
into
his
napkin
that
must
be
from
louise
little
louise
at
last
merle
was
awakened
by
the
touch
of
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
oh
are
you
there
merle
they
embraced
and
he
kissed
her
forehead
but
she
could
see
that
his
mind
was
busy
with
other
things
they
sat
down
to
table
and
began
their
meal
she
could
read
the
expression
of
his
face
his
voice
his
calm
air
she
knew
they
meant
bad
news
but
she
would
not
question
him
she
would
only
try
to
show
him
that
all
things
else
could
be
endured
if
only
they
two
loved
each
other
but
the
time
had
passed
when
an
unexpected
caress
from
her
was
enough
to
send
him
wild
with
joy
she
sat
there
now
trembling
inwardly
with
suspense
wondering
if
he
would
notice
her
if
he
could
find
any
comfort
in
having
her
with
him
still
young
and
with
something
of
her
beauty
left
he
looked
over
to
her
with
a
smile
merle
he
asked
what
do
you
think
your
father
is
worth
altogether
the
words
came
like
a
quiet
order
from
a
captain
standing
on
the
bridge
while
his
ship
goes
down
oh
peer
don
t
think
about
all
that
welcome
home
and
she
smiled
and
took
his
hand
thanks
he
said
and
pressed
her
fingers
but
his
thoughts
were
still
far
off
and
he
went
on
eating
without
knowing
what
he
ate
and
what
do
you
think
louise
has
begun
the
violin
you
ve
no
idea
how
the
little
thing
takes
to
oh
and
asta
s
got
another
tooth
she
had
a
wretched
time
poor
thing
while
it
was
coming
it
was
as
if
she
were
drawing
the
children
up
to
him
to
show
him
that
at
least
he
still
had
them
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
merle
you
ought
never
to
have
married
me
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
and
for
your
people
oh
nonsense
peer
you
know
you
ll
be
able
to
make
it
all
right
they
went
up
to
bed
and
undressed
slowly
he
hasn
t
noticed
me
yet
thought
merle
and
she
laughed
a
little
and
said
i
was
sitting
thinking
this
evening
of
the
first
day
we
met
i
suppose
you
never
think
of
it
now
he
turned
round
half
undressed
and
looked
at
her
her
lively
tone
fell
strangely
on
his
ears
she
does
not
ask
how
i
have
got
on
or
how
things
are
going
he
thought
but
as
he
went
on
looking
at
her
he
began
at
last
to
see
through
her
smile
to
the
anxious
heart
beneath
ah
yes
he
remembered
well
that
summer
when
life
had
been
a
holiday
in
the
hills
and
a
girl
making
coffee
over
a
fire
had
smiled
at
him
for
the
first
time
and
he
remembered
the
first
night
of
his
love
on
the
shining
when
his
heart
was
filled
with
the
rush
of
a
great
anthem
to
heaven
and
earth
she
stood
there
still
he
had
her
yet
but
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
she
came
to
him
now
humbly
begging
him
to
make
the
best
of
her
as
she
was
an
unspeakable
warmth
began
to
flow
through
his
heavy
heart
but
he
did
not
rush
to
embrace
her
and
whirl
her
off
in
a
storm
of
passionate
delight
he
stood
still
staring
before
him
and
drawing
himself
up
swore
to
himself
with
lips
that
he
would
he
would
trample
a
way
through
and
save
things
for
them
both
even
yet
the
lights
were
put
out
and
soon
they
lay
in
their
separate
beds
breathing
heavily
in
the
dark
peer
stretched
himself
out
with
his
face
up
thinking
with
closed
eyes
he
was
hunting
in
the
dark
for
some
way
to
save
his
dear
ones
and
merle
lay
so
long
waiting
for
one
caress
from
him
that
at
last
she
had
to
draw
out
her
handkerchief
and
press
it
over
her
eyes
while
her
body
shook
with
a
noiseless
sobbing

old
lorentz
uthoug
rarely
visited
his
rich
sister
at
bruseth
but
he
had
taken
his
weary
way
up
there
and
the
two
masterful
old
folks
sat
now
facing
each
other
so
you
ve
managed
to
find
your
way
up
here
said
aunt
marit
throwing
out
her
ample
bosom
and
rubbing
her
knees
like
a
man
why
yes
i
thought
i
d
like
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
said
uthoug
squaring
his
broad
shoulders
quite
well
thanks
having
no
i
m
not
likely
to
go
bankrupt
i
i
m
not
bankrupt
either
said
old
uthoug
fixing
his
red
eyes
on
her
face
perhaps
not
but
what
about
him
neither
is
he
he
ll
be
a
rich
man
before
very
he
rich
did
you
say
rich
before
a
year
s
out
answered
the
old
man
calmly
but
you
ll
have
to
i
aunt
marit
shifted
her
chair
backwards
gaping
i
did
you
say
just
tell
me
how
many
hundreds
of
thousands
did
he
lose
over
that
ditch
or
drain
or
whatever
it
was
he
was
six
months
behind
time
in
finishing
it
i
know
but
the
company
agreed
to
halve
the
forfeit
for
delay
when
they
d
seen
what
a
masterpiece
the
work
ah
yes
and
what
about
the
contractors
whom
he
couldn
t
pay
i
hear
he
s
paid
them
all
in
full
now
the
bank
arranged
i
see
after
you
and
he
had
mortaged
every
stick
and
rag
you
had
in
the
world
yes
indeed
you
deserve
a
good
whipping
the
pair
of
you
uthoug
stroked
his
beard
from
a
financial
point
of
view
the
thing
wasn
t
a
success
for
him
i
ll
admit
but
i
can
show
you
here
what
the
engineering
people
say
about
it
in
the
technical
papers
here
s
an
article
with
pictures
of
him
and
of
the
well
he
d
better
keep
his
family
on
pictures
in
the
papers
then
said
the
widow
paying
no
attention
to
the
paper
he
offered
he
ll
soon
be
on
top
again
said
her
brother
putting
the
papers
back
in
his
pocket
he
sat
there
in
front
of
her
quite
unruffled
he
would
let
people
see
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
crushed
by
a
reverse
that
there
were
other
things
he
valued
more
than
money

has
he
got
round
you
again
with
some
nonsense
he
s
invented
a
new
mowing
machine
it
s
nearly
finished
and
the
experts
say
it
will
be
worth
a
ho
and
you
want
to
come
over
me
with
a
tale
like
that
the
widow
shifted
her
chair
a
little
farther
back
you
must
help
us
to
carry
on
through
this
year
both
of
us
if
you

aunt
marit
of

slapped
her
knees
emphatically
i
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
for
twenty
thousand
then
not
for
twenty
pence
lorentz
uthoug
fixed
his
gaze
on
his
sister
s
face
his
red
eyes
began
to
glow
you
ll
have
to
do
it
marit
he
said
calmly
he
took
a
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
set
to
work
to
fill
and
light
it
the
two
sat
for
a
while
looking
at
each
other
each
on
the
alert
for
fear
the
other
s
will
should
prove
the
stronger
they
looked
at
each
other
so
long
that
at
last
both
smiled
involuntarily
i
suppose
you
ve
taken
to
going
to
church
with
your
wife
now
asked
the
widow
at
last
her
eyes
blinking
derision
if
i
put
my
trust
in
the
lord
he
said
i
might
just
sit
down
and
pray
and
let
things
go
to
ruin
as
it
is
i
ve
more
faith
in
human
works
and
that
s
why
i
m
here
the
answer
pleased
her
the
widow
at
bruseth
was
no
churchgoer
herself
she
thought
the
lord
had
made
a
bad
mistake
in
not
giving
her
any
children
will
you
have
some
coffee
she
asked
rising
from
her
seat
now
you
re
talking
sense
said
her
brother
and
his
eyes
twinkled
he
knew
his
sister
and
her
ways
and
now
he
lit
his
pipe
and
leaned
back
comfortably
in
his
chair
chapter
xiii
once
more
peer
stood
in
his
workroom
down
at
the
foundry
wrestling
with
fire
and
steel
a
working
drawing
is
a
useful
thing
an
idea
in
one
s
head
is
all
very
well
but
the
men
he
employed
to
turn
his
plans
into
tangible
models
worked
slowly
why
not
use
his
own
hands
for
what
had
to
be
done
when
the
workmen
arrived
at
the
foundry
in
the
morning
there
was
hammering
going
on
already
in
the
little
room
and
when
they
left
in
the
evening
the
master
had
not
stopped
working
yet
when
the
good
citizens
of
ringeby
went
to
bed
they
would
look
out
of
their
windows
and
see
his
light
still
burning
peer
had
had
plenty
to
tire
him
out
even
before
he
began
work
here
but
in
the
old
days
no
one
had
ever
asked
if
he
felt
strong
enough
to
do
this
or
that
and
he
never
asked
himself
now
as
before
it
was
a
question
of
getting
something
done
at
any
cost
and
never
before
had
there
been
so
much
at
stake
the
wooden
model
of
the
new
machine
is
finished
already
and
the
castings
put
together
the
whole
thing
looks
simple
enough
and
yet
what
a
distance
from
the
first
rough
implement
to
this
thing
which
seems
almost
to
live
a
thing
with
a
brain
of
metal
at
least
have
not
these
wheels
and
axles
had
their
parents
and
ancestors
their
pedigree
stretching
back
into
the
past
the
steel
has
brought
forth
and
its
descendants
again
in
turn
advancing
always
toward
something
finer
stronger
more
efficient
and
here
is
the
last
stage
reached
by
human
invention
in
this
particular
work
up
to
now
yet
after
all
is
it
good
enough
an
invention
successful
enough
to
bring
money
in
to
the
inventor
that
is
not
all
it
must
be
more
it
must
be
a
a
thing
to
make
its
way
across
the
prairies
across
the
enormous
plains
of
india
and
egypt
that
is
what
is
needed
sleep
rest
food
what
are
such
things
when
so
much
is
at
stake
there
was
no
longer
that
questioning
in
his
ear
why
whither
what
then
useless
to
ponder
on
these
things
his
horizon
was
narrowed
down
to
include
nothing
beyond
this
one
problem
once
he
had
dreamed
of
a
work
allied
to
his
dreams
of
eternity
this
certainly
was
not
it
what
does
the
gain
amount
to
after
all
when
humanity
has
one
more
machine
added
to
it
does
it
kindle
a
single
ray
of
dawn
the
more
in
a
human
soul
yet
this
work
such
as
it
was
had
now
become
his
all
it
must
and
should
be
all
he
was
fast
bound
to
it
when
he
looked
up
at
the
window
there
seemed
to
be
faces
at
each
pane
staring
in
what
not
finished
yet
they
seemed
to
say
think
what
it
means
if
you
fail
merle
s
face
and
the
children
s
must
we
be
driven
from
loreng
out
into
the
cold
the
faces
of
old
uthoug
and
his
wife
was
it
for
this
you
came
into
an
honourable
family
to
bring
it
to
ruin
and
behind
them
swarming
all
the
town
all
knew
what
was
at
stake
and
why
he
was
toiling
so
all
stared
at
him
waiting
the
bank
manager
was
there
too
waiting
like
the
rest
one
can
seize
one
s
neck
in
iron
pincers
and
say
you
shall
tired
difficulties
time
too
short
all
that
doesn
t
exist
you
shall
is
this
thing
or
that
impossible
well
make
it
possible
it
is
your
business
to
make
it
possible
he
spent
but
little
time
at
home
now
a
sofa
in
the
workshop
was
his
bed
often
merle
would
come
in
with
food
for
him
and
seeing
how
pale
and
grey
and
worn
out
he
was
she
did
not
dare
to
question
him
she
tried
to
jest
instead
she
had
trained
herself
long
ago
to
be
gay
in
a
house
where
shadows
had
to
be
driven
off
with
laughter
but
one
day
as
she
was
leaving
he
held
her
back
and
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
smile
well
dear
she
said
with
a
questioning
look
he
stood
looking
at
her
as
before
with
the
same
smile
he
was
looking
through
her
into
the
little
world
she
stood
for
this
home
this
family
that
he
a
homeless
man
had
won
through
her
was
it
all
to
go
down
in
shipwreck
then
he
kissed
her
eyes
and
let
her
go
and
as
her
footsteps
died
away
he
stood
a
moment
moved
by
a
sudden
desire
to
turn
to
some
power
above
him
with
a
prayer
that
he
might
succeed
in
this
work
but
there
was
no
such
power
and
in
the
end
his
eyes
turned
once
more
to
the
iron
the
fire
his
tools
and
his
own
hands
and
it
was
as
though
he
sighed
out
a
prayer
to
these
help
me
help
me
that
i
may
save
my
wife
and
children
s
sleep
rest
weariness
he
had
only
a
year
s
grace
the
bank
would
only
wait
a
year
winter
and
spring
passed
and
one
day
in
july
he
came
home
and
rushed
in
upon
merle
crying
merle
they
will
be
here
who
the
people
to
look
at
the
machine
we
re
going
to
try
it
oh
peer
she
said
breathlessly
gazing
at
him
it
s
a
good
thing
that
i
had
connections
abroad
he
went
on
there
s
one
man
coming
from
an
english
firm
and
another
from
america
it
ought
to
be
a
big
the
morrow
came
merle
stood
looking
after
her
husband
as
he
drove
off
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
through
the
haze
that
followed
the
night
s
rain
but
there
was
no
time
to
stand
trembling
they
were
to
have
the
strangers
to
dinner
and
she
must
see
to
it
out
in
the
field
the
machine
stood
ready
a
slender
newly
painted
thing
a
boy
was
harnessing
the
horses
two
men
in
soft
hats
and
light
overcoats
came
up
it
was
old
uthoug
and
the
bank
manager
they
stopped
and
looked
round
leaning
on
their
sticks
the
results
of
the
day
were
not
a
matter
of
entire
indifference
to
these
two
gentlemen
ah
here
was
the
big
carriage
from
loreng
with
the
two
strangers
and
peer
himself
who
had
been
down
to
fetch
them
from
the
hotel
he
was
a
little
pale
as
he
took
the
reins
and
climbed
to
his
seat
on
the
machine
to
drive
it
himself
through
the
meadow
of
high
thick
the
horses
pricked
up
their
ears
and
tried
to
break
into
a
gallop
the
noise
of
the
machine
behind
them
startling
them
as
usual
at
first
but
they
soon
settled
down
to
a
steady
pace
and
the
steel
arm
bearing
the
shears
swept
a
broad
swath
through
the
meadow
where
the
grass
stood
shining
after
the
rain
the
two
strangers
walked
slowly
in
the
rear
bending
down
now
and
again
to
look
at
the
stubble
and
see
if
the
shears
cut
clean
the
tall
man
with
the
heavy
beard
and
was
the
agent
for
john
fowler
of
leeds
the
little
one
with
the
jewish
nose
represented
harrow
of
philadelphia
now
and
again
they
called
to
peer
to
stop
while
they
investigated
some
part
of
the
machine
they
asked
him
then
to
try
it
on
different
ground
on
an
uneven
slope
over
little
tussocks
and
at
last
the
agent
for
fowler
s
would
have
it
that
it
should
be
tried
on
a
patch
of
stony
ground
but
that
would
spoil
the
shears
very
likely
but
fowler
s
would
like
to
know
exactly
how
the
shears
were
affected
by
stones
on
the
ground
at
last
the
trials
were
over
and
the
visitors
nodded
thoughtfully
to
each
other
evidently
they
had
come
on
something
new
here
there
were
possibilities
in
the
thing
that
might
drive
most
other
types
out
of
the
field
even
in
the
intense
competition
that
rages
all
round
the
world
in
agricultural
machinery
peer
read
the
expression
in
their
eyes
these
specialists
had
seen
the
vision
they
had
seen
gold
but
all
the
same
there
was
a
hitch
a
little
hitch
dinner
was
over
the
visitors
had
left
and
merle
and
peer
were
alone
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
inquiringly
it
went
off
well
then
she
asked
yes
but
there
is
just
one
little
thing
to
put
still
something
to
put
right
after
you
have
worked
so
hard
all
these
months
she
sat
down
and
her
hands
dropped
into
her
lap
it
s
only
a
small
detail
he
said
eagerly
pacing
up
and
down
when
the
grass
is
wet
it
sticks
between
the
steel
fingers
above
the
shears
and
accumulates
there
and
gets
in
the
way
it
s
the
devil
and
all
that
i
never
thought
of
testing
it
myself
in
wet
weather
but
once
i
ve
got
that
right
my
girl
the
thing
will
be
a
once
more
the
machine
was
set
up
in
his
workshop
and
he
walked
around
it
watching
spying
thinking
racking
his
brain
to
find
the
little
device
that
should
make
all
well
all
else
was
finished
all
was
right
but
he
still
lacked
the
single
happy
thought
the
flash
of
inspiration
that
given
a
moment
s
work
would
be
enough
to
give
this
thing
of
steel
life
and
wings
with
which
to
fly
out
over
the
wide
world
it
might
come
at
any
moment
that
happy
thought
and
he
tramped
round
and
round
his
machine
clenching
his
fists
in
desperation
because
it
was
so
slow
in
coming
the
last
touch
only
the
dot
upon
an
i
was
wanting
a
slight
change
in
the
shape
or
position
of
the
fingers
or
the
length
of
the
shears
what
was
it
he
wanted
how
could
he
sleep
that
night
he
felt
that
he
stood
face
to
face
with
a
difficulty
that
could
have
been
easily
solved
had
he
come
fresh
to
the
work
but
that
his
tortured
brain
was
too
worn
out
to
overcome
but
when
an
arab
horse
is
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
then
is
the
time
when
it
breaks
into
a
gallop
he
could
not
wait
there
were
the
faces
at
the
window
again
staring
and
asking
not
finished
yet
merle
the
children
uthoug
and
his
wife
the
bank
manager
and
there
were
his
competitors
the
world
over
he
was
a
length
ahead
of
them
but
by
he
might
be
left
behind
wait
rest
no
it
was
autumn
now
and
sleepless
nights
drove
him
to
a
doctor
who
prescribed
cold
baths
perfect
quiet
sleeping
draughts
iron
and
arsenic
ah
yes
peer
could
swallow
all
the
prescriptions
the
one
thing
he
could
not
do
was
rest
or
sleep
he
would
sit
late
into
the
night
prostrate
with
exhaustion
watching
the
dying
embers
of
the
forge
the
steel
the
tools
and
innumerable
sparks
would
begin
to
fly
before
his
eyes
and
masses
of
molten
iron
to
creep
about
like
living
things
over
walls
and
and
over
by
the
forge
was
something
more
defined
a
misty
shape
that
grew
in
size
and
clearness
and
stood
at
last
a
bearded
naked
demigod
with
fire
in
one
hand
and
sledgehammer
in
the
other
what
who
is
that
man
do
you
not
know
me
who
are
you
i
ask
i
have
a
thing
to
tell
you
it
is
vain
for
you
to
seek
for
any
other
faith
than
faith
in
the
evolution
of
the
universe
it
will
do
no
good
to
pray
you
may
dream
yourself
away
from
the
steel
and
the
fire
but
you
must
offer
yourself
up
to
them
at
last
you
are
bound
fast
to
these
things
outside
them
your
soul
is
nothing
god
happiness
yourself
eternal
life
for
you
all
these
are
nothing
the
will
of
the
world
rolls
on
towards
its
eternal
goal
and
the
individual
is
but
fuel
for
the
peer
would
spring
up
believing
for
a
moment
that
someone
was
really
there
but
there
was
nothing
only
the
empty
air
now
and
again
he
would
go
home
to
loreng
but
everything
there
seemed
to
pass
in
a
mist
he
could
see
that
merle
s
eyes
were
red
though
she
sang
cheerily
as
she
went
about
the
house
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
begged
him
to
go
to
bed
and
rest
and
he
had
gone
to
bed
it
would
be
delicious
to
sleep
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
the
fault
lay
in
the
shape
of
the
shears
after
all
and
then
there
was
no
stopping
him
from
getting
up
and
hurrying
in
to
the
workshop
winter
has
come
round
again
and
he
fights
his
way
in
through
a
and
in
the
quiet
night
he
lights
his
lamp
kindles
the
forge
fire
screws
off
the
blades
of
the
shears
once
more
but
when
he
has
altered
them
and
fixed
them
in
place
again
he
knows
at
once
that
the
defect
was
not
in
them
after
all
coffee
is
a
good
thing
for
keeping
the
brain
clear
he
took
to
making
it
in
the
workshop
for
himself
and
at
night
especially
a
few
cups
did
him
good
they
were
so
satisfying
too
that
he
felt
no
desire
for
food
and
when
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
make
each
separate
part
of
the
machine
over
again
anew
coffee
was
great
help
keeping
him
awake
through
many
a
long
night
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
merle
and
his
and
the
bank
manager
had
taken
to
lurking
about
the
place
night
and
day
watching
and
spying
to
see
if
the
work
were
not
nearly
done
why
in
the
devil
s
name
could
they
not
leave
him
in
peace
just
one
week
more
in
any
case
the
machine
could
not
be
tried
before
next
summer
at
times
the
workers
at
the
foundry
would
be
startled
by
their
master
suddenly
rushing
out
from
his
inner
room
and
crying
fiercely
no
one
is
to
come
in
here
i
will
be
left
in
peace
and
when
he
had
gone
in
again
they
would
look
at
each
other
and
shake
their
heads
one
morning
merle
came
down
and
walked
through
the
outer
shops
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
husband
s
room
there
was
no
answer
and
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
a
moment
after
the
workmen
heard
a
woman
s
shriek
and
when
they
ran
in
she
was
bending
over
her
husband
who
was
seated
on
the
floor
staring
up
at
her
with
blank
uncomprehending
eyes
peer
she
cried
shaking
his
shoulder
peer
do
you
hear
oh
for
god
s
sake
what
is
it
my
darling
one
april
day
there
was
a
stir
in
the
little
town
of
ringeby
and
a
stream
of
people
all
in
their
best
clothes
though
it
was
only
wednesday
was
moving
out
along
the
fjord
road
to
loreng
there
were
the
two
editors
who
had
just
settled
one
of
their
everlasting
disputes
and
the
two
lawyers
each
still
intent
on
snatching
any
scraps
of
business
that
offered
there
were
tradesmen
and
artisans
and
nearly
everyone
was
wearing
a
long
overcoat
and
a
grey
felt
hat
but
the
tanner
had
put
on
a
high
silk
hat
so
as
to
look
a
little
taller
where
the
road
left
the
wood
most
of
them
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
up
at
loreng
the
great
white
house
seemed
to
have
set
itself
high
on
its
hill
to
look
out
far
and
wide
over
the
lake
and
the
country
round
and
men
talked
of
the
great
doings
the
feasting
and
magnificence
the
great
house
had
seen
in
days
gone
by
from
the
time
when
the
place
had
been
a
governor
s
residence
until
a
few
years
back
when
engineer
holm
was
in
his
glory
but
the
place
was
up
to
auction
with
stock
and
furniture
and
people
had
walked
or
driven
over
from
far
around
for
the
bank
management
felt
they
would
not
be
justified
in
giving
any
longer
grace
now
that
peer
holm
was
lying
sick
in
hospital
and
no
doctor
would
undertake
to
say
whether
he
would
ever
be
fit
to
work
again
the
courtyard
was
soon
crowded
inside
in
the
great
hall
the
auctioneer
was
beginning
to
put
up
the
lots
already
but
most
people
hung
back
a
little
as
if
they
felt
a
reluctance
to
go
in
for
the
air
in
there
seemed
charged
with
lingering
memories
of
splendour
and
hospitality
from
the
days
when
cavaliers
with
ruffles
and
golden
spurs
had
done
homage
there
to
ladies
in
sweeping
silk
robes
down
to
the
last
gay
banquets
to
which
the
famous
engineer
from
egypt
had
loved
to
gather
all
the
gentry
round
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
most
of
the
people
stood
on
the
steps
and
in
the
and
now
and
again
they
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
pale
woman
dressed
in
black
with
thick
dark
eyebrows
crossing
the
courtyard
to
a
servant
s
house
or
a
storehouse
to
give
some
order
for
moving
the
things
it
was
merle
now
mistress
here
no
longer
old
lorentz
uthoug
met
his
sister
the
mighty
lady
of
bruseth
on
the
steps
she
looked
at
him
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
derision
in
her
narrowed
eyes
but
he
drew
himself
up
and
said
as
he
passed
her
you
ve
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
ve
settled
things
so
that
i
m
not
bankrupt
yet
and
you
shall
have
your
share
in
and
he
strode
in
a
upright
figure
looking
calmly
at
all
men
that
all
might
see
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
crushed
by
a
reverse
late
in
the
day
the
chestnut
bijou
was
put
up
for
sale
he
was
led
across
the
courtyard
in
a
halter
and
as
he
came
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
threw
up
his
head
and
neighed
and
from
the
stables
the
other
horses
neighed
in
answer
was
it
a
farewell
did
he
remember
the
day
years
ago
when
he
had
come
there
first
dancing
on
his
feet
full
of
youth
and
strength
but
by
the
woodshed
there
stood
as
usual
a
little
grey
old
man
busy
sawing
and
chopping
as
if
nothing
at
all
was
the
matter
one
master
left
another
took
his
place
one
needed
firewood
it
seemed
to
him
as
much
as
the
other
and
if
they
came
and
gave
him
notice
why
thank
the
lord
he
was
stone
deaf
thud
thud
the
sound
of
the
axe
went
on
a
young
man
came
driving
up
the
hill
a
young
man
with
very
blue
eyes
he
took
off
his
overcoat
in
the
passage
revealing
a
long
black
frock
coat
beneath
and
a
waistcoat
it
was
uthoug
junior
general
agent
for
english
tweeds
he
had
taken
no
part
in
his
s
business
affairs
and
so
he
was
able
to
help
his
father
in
this
crisis
but
the
auction
at
loreng
went
on
for
several
days
book
iii
chapter
i
once
more
a
deep
valley
with
farms
on
the
hillsides
between
the
river
and
the
behind
one
day
about
midsummer
it
was
old
raastad
himself
that
came
down
to
meet
the
train
driving
a
with
a
waggon
following
behind
was
he
expecting
visitors
the
people
at
the
station
asked
him
maybe
i
am
said
old
raastad
stroking
his
heavy
beard
and
he
limped
about
looking
to
his
horses
was
it
the
folk
who
had
taken
the
ay
it
s
likely
them
said
the
old
man
the
train
came
in
and
a
pale
man
with
grey
hair
and
beard
and
blue
spectacles
stepped
out
and
he
had
a
wife
and
three
children
with
him
paul
raastad
inquired
the
stranger
ay
that
s
me
said
the
old
man
the
stranger
looked
up
at
the
great
mountains
to
the
north
rising
dizzily
into
the
sky
the
air
ought
to
be
good
here
said
he
ay
the
air
s
good
enough
by
all
accounts
said
raastad
and
began
loading
up
the
carts
they
drove
off
up
the
hill
road
the
man
and
his
wife
sat
in
the
the
woman
with
a
child
in
her
lap
but
a
boy
and
a
girl
were
seated
on
the
load
in
the
behind
raastad
can
we
see
the
farm
from
here
asked
the
woman
turning
her
head
there
said
the
old
man
pointing
and
looking
they
saw
a
big
farmstead
high
up
on
a
sunny
close
under
the
crest
and
near
by
a
long
low
house
with
a
steep
slate
roof
the
sort
of
place
where
the
district
officers
used
to
live
in
old
days
is
that
the
house
we
are
to
live
in
she
asked
again
ay
that
s
it
right
enough
said
old
raastad
and
chirruped
to
his
horses
the
woman
looked
long
at
the
farm
and
sighed
so
this
was
to
be
their
new
home
they
were
to
live
here
far
from
all
their
friends
and
would
it
give
him
back
his
health
after
all
the
doctors
medicines
had
failed
a
lapland
dog
met
them
at
the
gate
and
barked
at
them
a
couple
of
pigs
came
down
the
road
stopped
and
studied
the
new
arrivals
with
profound
attention
then
wheeled
suddenly
and
galloped
off
among
the
houses
the
farmer
s
wife
herself
was
waiting
outside
the
a
tall
wrinkled
woman
with
a
black
cap
on
her
head
welcome
she
said
offering
a
rough
and
bony
hand
the
house
was
one
of
large
rooms
with
big
stoves
that
would
need
a
deal
of
firewood
in
winter
the
furniture
was
a
mixture
of
every
possible
sort
and
style
a
mahogany
sofa
cupboards
with
painted
roses
on
the
panels
chairs
covered
with
old
norse
carving
and
on
the
walls
appalling
pictures
of
foreign
royal
families
and
of
the
crucifixion
good
heavens
said
merle
as
they
went
round
the
rooms
alone
how
shall
we
ever
get
used
to
all
this
but
just
then
louise
came
rushing
in
breathless
with
news
mother
father
there
are
goats
here
and
little
lorentz
came
toddling
in
after
her
goats
mother
he
cried
stumbling
over
the
doorstep
the
old
house
had
stood
empty
and
dead
for
years
now
it
seemed
to
have
wakened
up
again
footsteps
went
in
and
out
and
the
stairs
creaked
once
more
under
the
tread
of
feet
small
pattering
exploring
feet
and
big
feet
going
about
on
errands
there
was
movement
in
every
corner
a
rattle
of
pots
and
pans
in
the
kitchen
fires
blazed
up
and
smoke
began
to
rise
from
the
chimney
people
passing
by
outside
looked
up
at
it
and
saw
that
the
dead
old
house
had
come
to
life
again
peer
was
weak
still
after
his
illness
but
he
could
help
a
little
with
the
unpacking
it
took
very
little
though
to
make
him
out
of
breath
and
giddy
and
there
was
a
continually
thumping
somewhere
in
the
back
of
his
head
suppose
suppose
after
all
the
change
here
does
you
no
good
you
are
at
the
last
stage
you
ve
managed
to
borrow
the
money
to
keep
you
all
here
for
a
year
and
then
your
wife
and
children
hush
better
not
think
of
that
not
that
think
of
anything
else
only
not
that
clothes
to
be
carried
upstairs
yes
yes
and
to
think
it
was
all
to
end
in
your
living
on
other
people
s
charity
even
that
can
t
go
on
long
if
you
should
be
no
better
next
summer
or
two
years
hence
what
then
for
yourself
yes
there
s
always
one
way
out
for
you
but
merle
and
the
children
hush
don
t
think
of
it
once
it
was
your
whole
duty
to
finish
a
certain
piece
of
work
in
a
certain
time
now
it
is
your
duty
to
get
well
again
to
be
as
strong
as
a
horse
by
next
year
it
is
your
duty
if
only
the
would
stop
that
cursed
in
the
back
of
your
head
merle
as
she
went
out
and
in
was
thinking
perhaps
of
the
same
thing
but
her
head
was
full
of
so
much
else
getting
things
in
order
and
the
household
set
going
food
had
to
be
bought
from
the
local
shop
and
how
many
litres
of
milk
would
she
require
in
the
morning
where
could
she
get
eggs
she
must
go
across
at
once
to
the
raastads
and
ask
so
the
pale
woman
in
the
dark
dress
walked
slowly
with
bowed
head
across
the
courtyard
but
when
she
stopped
to
speak
to
people
about
the
place
they
would
forget
their
manners
and
stare
at
her
she
smiled
so
strangely
father
there
s
a
box
of
starlings
on
the
wall
here
said
louise
as
she
lay
in
bed
with
her
arms
round
peer
s
neck
saying
and
there
s
a
swallow
s
nest
under
the
eaves
oh
yes
we
ll
have
great
fun
at
raastad
just
you
wait
and
soon
merle
and
peer
too
lay
in
their
strange
beds
looking
out
at
the
luminous
summer
night
they
were
shipwrecked
people
washed
ashore
here
but
it
was
not
so
clear
that
they
were
saved
peer
turned
restlessly
from
side
to
side
he
was
so
worn
to
skin
and
bone
that
his
nerves
seemed
laid
bare
and
he
could
not
rest
in
any
position
also
there
were
three
hundred
wheels
whirring
in
his
head
and
striking
out
sparks
that
flew
up
and
turned
to
visions
rest
why
had
he
never
been
content
to
rest
in
the
days
when
all
went
well
he
had
made
his
mark
at
the
first
cataract
yes
and
had
made
big
sums
of
money
out
of
his
new
pump
but
all
the
time
there
were
the
gnawing
questions
why
and
whither
and
what
then
he
had
been
chief
engineer
and
had
built
a
railway
and
could
have
had
commissions
to
build
more
railways
but
again
the
questions
why
and
what
then
home
then
home
and
strike
root
in
his
native
land
well
and
had
that
brought
him
rest
what
was
it
that
drove
him
away
again
the
steel
the
steel
and
the
fire
ah
that
day
when
he
had
stepped
down
from
the
mowing
machine
and
had
been
ensnared
by
the
idea
of
improving
it
why
had
he
ever
taken
it
up
did
he
need
money
no
or
was
the
work
at
a
standstill
no
but
the
steel
would
on
it
had
need
of
a
man
it
had
taken
him
by
the
throat
and
said
you
shall
happiness
rest
ah
no
for
you
see
a
mass
of
knowledge
and
experience
turns
one
fine
day
into
an
army
of
evil
powers
that
lash
you
on
and
on
unceasingly
you
may
stumble
you
may
fall
what
does
it
matter
the
steel
squeezes
one
man
dry
and
then
grips
the
next
the
flame
of
the
world
has
need
of
fuel
bow
thy
head
man
and
leap
into
the
fire
you
prosper
you
are
cast
down
into
a
hell
on
earth
what
matter
you
are
fuel
for
the
fire
but
i
will
not
i
will
not
be
swallowed
up
in
the
flame
of
the
world
even
though
it
be
the
only
godhead
in
the
universe
i
will
tear
myself
loose
be
something
in
and
for
myself
i
will
have
an
immortal
soul
the
that
progress
may
have
wrought
a
thousand
years
hence
what
is
it
to
me
your
soul
just
think
of
all
your
noble
feelings
towards
that
of
yours
shakespeare
was
wrong
it
s
the
bastard
that
gets
cheated
dearest
peer
do
for
god
s
sake
try
to
get
to
oh
yes
i
ll
get
to
sleep
all
right
but
it
s
so
he
threw
off
the
clothes
and
lay
breathing
heavily
i
m
sure
you
re
lying
thinking
and
brooding
over
things
can
t
you
do
what
the
swedish
doctor
told
you
just
try
to
think
that
everything
is
dark
all
round
peer
turns
round
and
everything
around
him
is
dark
but
in
the
heart
of
that
darkness
waves
arise
waves
of
melody
rolling
nearer
nearer
it
is
the
sound
of
a
hymn
it
is
louise
standing
playing
his
sister
louise
and
what
peace
o
god
what
peace
and
rest
but
soon
louise
fades
away
she
fades
away
and
vanishes
like
a
flame
blown
out
and
there
comes
a
roaring
noise
nearer
and
nearer
grinding
crashing
rattling
and
he
knows
now
what
it
is
only
too
well
it
is
the
song
of
the
steel
the
roar
of
steel
from
ships
and
from
with
their
pairs
of
yellow
evil
eyes
rushing
on
full
of
human
captives
whither
faster
faster
driven
by
competition
by
the
steel
demon
that
hunts
men
on
without
rest
or
respite
that
hurries
on
the
pulse
of
the
world
to
fever
to
hallucination
to
madness
crashing
of
steel
girders
falling
the
hum
of
wheels
the
clash
of
cranes
and
winches
and
chains
the
clang
of
at
work
all
are
in
that
roar
the
fire
flares
up
with
hellish
eyes
in
every
dark
corner
and
men
swarm
around
in
the
red
glow
like
evil
angels
they
are
the
slaves
of
steel
and
fire
lashed
onwards
never
resting
is
this
the
spirit
of
prometheus
look
the
will
of
steel
is
flinging
men
up
into
the
air
now
it
is
conquering
the
heavens
why
that
it
may
rush
the
faster
it
craves
for
yet
more
speed
quicker
quicker
dizzier
yet
hurrying
wherefore
whither
alas
it
knows
not
itself
are
the
children
of
the
earth
grown
so
homeless
do
they
fear
to
take
a
moment
s
rest
do
they
dread
to
look
inward
and
see
their
own
emptiness
are
they
longing
for
something
they
have
lost
some
hymn
some
harmony
some
god
god
they
find
a
bloodthirsty
jehovah
and
an
ascetic
on
the
cross
what
gods
are
these
for
modern
men

get
he
twined
his
fingers
into
hers
and
at
last
the
sound
of
louise
s
hymn
came
to
him
once
more
lifting
and
rocking
him
gently
till
his
eyes
closed
chapter
ii
a
little
road
winds
in
among
the
woods
two
only
with
a
carpet
of
brown
between
but
there
are
trees
and
the
sky
quiet
and
peace
so
that
it
s
a
real
blessing
to
walk
there
it
rises
and
falls
so
gently
that
no
one
need
get
out
of
breath
indeed
it
seems
to
go
along
with
one
all
the
time
in
mere
friendliness
whispering
take
it
easy
take
your
time
have
a
good
rest
and
so
on
it
goes
winding
in
among
the
slender
and
supple
as
a
young
girl
peer
walked
here
every
day
he
would
stop
and
look
up
into
the
tops
of
the
fir
trees
and
walk
on
again
then
sit
down
for
a
moment
on
a
mossy
stone
but
only
for
a
moment
always
he
was
up
again
soon
and
moving
on
though
he
had
nowhere
to
go
but
at
least
there
was
peace
here
he
would
linger
watching
an
insect
as
it
crept
along
a
fir
branch
or
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
river
in
the
valley
far
below
or
breathing
in
the
scent
of
the
resin
thick
in
the
warm
air
this
present
life
of
his
was
one
way
of
living
as
he
lay
after
a
sleepless
night
watching
the
window
grow
lighter
with
the
dawn
he
would
think
yet
another
new
day
and
nothing
that
i
can
do
in
it
and
yet
he
had
to
get
up
and
dress
and
go
down
and
eat
his
bread
had
a
slightly
bitter
taste
to
him
it
tasted
of
charity
and
dependence
of
the
rich
widow
at
bruseth
and
the
agent
for
english
tweeds
and
he
must
remember
to
eat
slowly
to
masticate
each
mouthful
carefully
to
rest
after
meals
and
above
all
not
to
think
not
to
think
of
anything
in
the
wide
world
afterwards
he
could
go
out
and
in
like
other
people
only
that
all
his
movements
and
actions
were
useless
and
meaningless
in
themselves
they
were
done
only
for
the
sake
of
health
or
to
keep
thoughts
away
or
to
make
the
time
go
by
how
had
this
come
to
pass
he
found
it
still
impossible
to
grasp
how
such
senseless
things
can
happen
and
no
providence
interfere
to
set
them
right
why
should
he
have
been
so
suddenly
doomed
to
destruction
days
weeks
and
months
of
his
best
manhood
oozing
away
into
empty
nothingness
why
sleeplessness
and
tortured
nerves
drove
him
to
do
things
that
his
will
disowned
he
would
storm
at
his
wife
and
children
if
a
heel
so
much
as
scraped
on
the
floor
and
the
remorse
that
followed
sometimes
ending
in
childish
tears
did
no
good
for
the
next
time
the
same
thing
or
worse
would
happen
again
this
was
the
burden
of
his
days
this
was
the
life
he
was
doomed
to
live
but
up
here
on
the
little
forest
track
he
harms
no
one
and
no
racking
noises
come
thrusting
sharp
knives
into
his
spine
here
is
a
great
peace
a
peace
that
does
a
man
good
down
on
the
grassy
slope
below
stands
a
grey
barn
it
reminds
him
of
an
old
horse
lifting
its
head
from
grazing
to
gaze
at
you
a
lonely
forsaken
creature
it
seems
it
will
sink
to
the
ground
and
rise
no
more
yet
it
takes
its
lot
calmly
and
patiently
ugh
how
far
he
has
got
from
raastad
a
cold
sweat
breaks
out
over
his
body
for
fear
he
may
not
have
strength
to
walk
back
again
uphill
well
pull
yourself
together
rest
a
little
and
he
lies
down
on
his
back
in
a
field
of
clover
and
stares
up
at
the
sky
a
stream
of
clean
air
fresh
from
the
snow
flows
all
day
long
down
the
valley
as
if
jotunheim
itself
where
it
lies
in
there
beneath
the
sky
were
breathing
in
easy
peer
fills
his
lungs
again
and
again
with
long
deep
draughts
drinking
in
the
air
like
a
saving
potion
help
me
then
oh
air
light
solitude
help
me
that
i
may
be
whole
once
more
and
fit
to
work
for
this
is
the
one
and
only
religion
left
me
to
cling
high
above
over
the
two
mountain
ranges
a
blue
flood
stands
immovable
and
in
its
depths
eternal
rest
is
brooding
but
is
there
a
will
there
too
that
is
concerned
with
men
on
earth
you
do
not
believe
in
it
and
yet
a
little
prayer
mounts
up
to
it
as
well
help
me
thou
too
who
thou
that
hearest
if
thou
care
at
all
for
the
miserable
things
called
men
that
crawl
upon
the
earth
help
me
if
i
once
prayed
for
a
great
work
that
could
stay
my
hunger
for
things
eternal
i
repent
me
now
and
confess
that
it
was
pride
and
vanity
make
me
a
slave
toiling
at
servile
tasks
for
food
so
that
merle
and
the
children
be
not
taken
from
me
hearest
thou
does
anyone
in
heaven
find
comfort
in
seeing
men
tortured
by
blind
fortune
are
my
wife
and
my
children
slaves
of
an
unmeaning
chance
and
yet
can
smile
and
laugh
answer
me
if
thou
hearest
thou
of
the
many
names
a
grasshopper
is
shrilling
in
the
grass
about
him
suddenly
he
starts
up
sitting
a
goes
screaming
past
below
and
so
the
days
go
on
each
morning
merle
would
steal
a
glance
at
her
husband
s
face
to
see
if
he
had
slept
if
his
eyes
were
dull
or
inflamed
or
calm
surely
he
must
be
better
soon
surely
their
stay
here
must
do
him
good
she
too
had
lost
faith
in
medicines
but
this
air
the
country
life
the
solitude
rest
rest
surely
there
must
soon
be
some
sign
that
these
were
helping
him
many
a
time
she
rose
in
the
morning
without
having
closed
her
eyes
all
night
but
there
were
the
children
to
look
after
the
house
to
see
to
and
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
get
on
without
a
maid
if
she
possibly
could
what
has
taken
you
over
to
the
farm
so
much
lately
she
asked
one
day
you
have
been
sitting
over
there
with
old
raastad
for
hours
i
i
go
over
to
amuse
myself
and
pass
the
time
he
said
do
you
talk
politics
no
we
play
cards
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
you
never
cared
for
cards
no
but
what
the
devil
am
i
to
do
i
can
t
read
because
of
these
cursed
eyes
of
mine
and
the
hammering
in
my
head
and
i
ve
counted
all
the
farms
up
and
down
the
valley
now
there
are
fifty
in
all
and
on
the
farm
here
there
are
just
houses
big
and
little
what
the
devil
am
i
to
take
to
next
merle
sighed
it
is
hard
she
said
but
couldn
t
you
wait
till
the
evening
to
play
cards
till
the
children
are
in
bed
then
i
could
play
with
you
that
would
be
thank
you
very
much
but
what
about
the
rest
of
the
day
do
you
know
what
it
s
like
to
go
about
from
dawn
to
dark
feeling
that
every
minute
is
wasted
and
wasted
for
nothing
no
you
can
t
know
it
what
am
i
to
do
with
myself
all
through
one
of
these
endless
deadly
days
drink
myself
drunk
couldn
t
you
try
cutting
firewood
for
a
little
firewood
he
whistled
softly
well
that
s
an
idea
ye
yes
let
s
try
chopping
firewood
for
a
thud
thud
thud
but
as
he
straightened
his
back
for
a
the
whirr
whirr
of
raastad
s
mowing
machine
came
to
him
from
the
near
by
where
it
was
working
and
he
clenched
his
teeth
as
if
they
ached
he
was
driving
a
mowing
machine
of
his
own
invention
and
it
was
raining
continually
and
the
grass
kept
sticking
sticking
and
how
to
put
it
right
put
it
right
it
was
as
if
blows
were
falling
on
festering
wounds
in
his
head
making
him
dance
with
pain
thud
thud
thud
anything
to
drown
the
whirr
of
that
machine
but
a
man
may
use
an
axe
with
his
hands
and
yet
have
idiotic
fancies
all
the
time
bubbling
and
seething
in
his
head
the
power
to
hold
in
check
the
vagaries
of
imagination
may
be
gone
from
all
sides
they
come
creeping
out
in
swarms
they
swoop
down
on
him
like
birds
of
prey
as
if
in
revenge
for
having
been
driven
away
so
often
before
they
cry
here
we
are
he
stood
once
more
as
an
apprentice
in
the
mechanical
works
riveting
the
plates
of
a
gigantic
boiler
with
a
tube
cling
clang
the
wailing
clang
of
the
boiler
went
out
over
the
whole
town
and
now
that
same
boiler
is
set
up
inside
his
head
ugh
a
cold
sweat
breaks
out
upon
his
body
he
throws
down
the
axe
he
must
go
must
fly
escape
somewhere
where
he
can
not
tell
faces
that
he
hates
to
think
of
peer
out
at
him
from
every
corner
yapping
out
heh
what
did
we
say
a
beggar
a
madman
in
a
but
it
may
happen
too
that
help
comes
in
the
night
things
come
back
to
a
man
that
it
is
good
to
remember
that
time
and
that
other
a
woman
there
and
the
one
you
met
in
such
a
place
there
is
a
picture
in
the
louvre
by
veronese
a
young
venetian
woman
steps
out
upon
the
marble
stairway
of
a
palace
holding
a
boy
by
the
hand
she
is
dressed
in
black
velvet
she
glows
with
youth
and
happiness
a
lovers
meeting
in
her
garden
the
first
kiss
moonlight
and
mandolins
a
shudder
of
pleasure
passes
through
his
weary
body
bright
recollections
and
impressions
flock
towards
him
like
spirits
of
light
he
can
hear
the
rushing
sound
of
their
wings
he
calls
to
them
for
aid
and
they
encircle
him
round
they
struggle
with
the
spirits
of
darkness
for
his
soul
he
has
known
much
brightness
much
beauty
in
his
life
surely
the
bright
angels
are
the
stronger
and
must
conquer
ah
why
had
he
not
lived
royally
amidst
women
and
flowers
and
wine
one
morning
as
he
was
getting
up
he
said
merle
i
must
and
will
hit
upon
something
that
ll
send
me
to
bed
thoroughly
tired
yes
dear
she
answered
do
i
ll
try
wheeling
stones
to
begin
with
he
said
the
devil
s
in
it
if
a
day
at
that
doesn
t
make
a
man
so
that
day
and
for
many
days
he
wheeled
stones
from
some
newly
broken
land
on
the
hillside
down
to
a
dyke
that
ran
along
the
road
calm
golden
autumn
days
one
farm
above
another
rising
up
towards
the
crest
of
the
range
all
set
in
ripe
yellow
fields
one
little
cottage
stands
right
on
the
crest
against
the
sky
itself
and
it
too
has
its
tiny
patch
of
yellow
corn
and
an
eagle
sails
slowly
across
the
deep
valley
from
peak
to
peak
people
passing
by
stared
at
peer
as
he
went
about
in
his
wheeling
stones
aye
gentlefolks
have
queer
notions
they
would
say
shaking
their
heads
that
s
it
keep
at
it
a
dry
hacking
voice
kept
going
in
peer
s
head
it
is
idiocy
but
you
are
doomed
to
it
shove
hard
with
those
skinny
legs
of
yours
many
a
jade
before
you
has
had
to
do
the
same
you
ve
got
to
get
some
sleep
tonight
only
ten
months
left
now
and
then
we
shall
have
lucifer
turning
up
at
the
once
more
poor
merle
she
s
beginning
to
grow
grey
and
the
poor
little
children
dreaming
of
father
beating
them
maybe
they
cry
out
so
often
in
their
sleep
off
now
trundle
away
now
over
with
that
load
and
back
for
another
you
that
once
looked
down
on
the
soulless
toil
for
bread
you
have
sunk
now
to
something
far
more
miserable
you
are
dragging
at
a
load
of
sheer
stupidity
you
are
a
with
calamity
for
your
as
you
move
the
chains
rattle
and
that
is
your
he
straightens
himself
up
wipes
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
begins
heaving
up
stones
into
his
barrow
again
how
long
must
it
last
this
life
in
manacles
do
you
remember
job
job
aye
doubtless
jehovah
was
sitting
at
some
jovial
feast
when
he
conceived
that
fantasy
of
a
drunken
brain
to
let
satan
loose
upon
a
happy
man
job
his
seven
sons
and
daughters
and
his
cattle
and
his
calves
were
restored
unto
him
but
we
read
nothing
of
any
compensation
made
him
for
the
jest
itself
he
was
made
to
play
court
fool
with
his
boils
and
his
tortures
and
his
misery
and
the
gods
had
their
bit
of
sport
gratis
job
had
his
actual
outlay
in
cattle
and
offspring
refunded
and
that
was
all
prometheus
is
it
you
after
all
that
are
the
friend
of
man
among
the
gods
have
you
indeed
the
power
to
free
us
all
some
day
when
will
you
come
then
to
raise
the
great
revolt
come
come
up
with
the
barrow
again
you
see
it
is
full
father
it
s
come
along
home
cries
little
louise
racing
down
the
hill
with
her
yellow
plaits
flying
about
her
ears
but
she
stops
cautiously
a
little
distance
off
there
is
no
knowing
what
sort
of
temper
father
may
be
in
thanks
little
monkey
got
anything
good
for
dinner
aha
that
s
a
secret
said
the
girl
in
a
teasing
voice
she
was
beaming
now
with
delight
at
finding
him
approachable
catch
me
father
i
can
run
quicker
than
you
can
i
m
afraid
i
m
too
tired
just
now
my
little
oh
poor
papa
are
you
tired
and
she
came
up
and
took
him
by
the
hand
then
she
slipped
her
arm
into
his
it
was
just
as
good
fun
to
walk
up
the
hill
on
her
father
s
arm
like
a
young
lady
then
came
the
frosts
and
one
morning
the
hilltops
were
turned
into
leaden
grey
clouds
from
which
the
snow
came
sweeping
down
merle
stood
at
the
window
her
face
grey
in
the
clammy
light
she
looked
down
the
valley
to
where
the
mountains
closed
it
in
it
seemed
still
narrower
than
before
one
s
breath
came
heavily
and
one
s
mind
seemed
stifled
under
cold
damp
wrappings
ugh
better
go
out
into
the
kitchen
and
set
to
work
again
work
work
and
forget
then
one
day
there
came
a
letter
telling
her
that
her
mother
was
dead
chapter

dear
klaus
brock
legendary
being
cast
down
from
khedivial
heights
one
day
and
up
again
on
high
with
kitchener
the
next
but
in
heaven
s
name
what
has
taken
you
to
the
soudan
what
made
you
go
and
risk
your
life
at
omdurman
the
same
old
desperation
i
suppose
that
you
re
always
complaining
about
and
why
of
all
things
plant
yourself
away
in
an
outpost
on
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
to
lie
awake
at
nights
nursing
suicidal
thoughts
over
schopenhauer
you
have
lived
without
principles
you
say
and
wasted
your
youth
and
are
homeless
now
all
round
with
no
morals
no
country
no
religion
but
will
you
make
all
this
better
by
making
things
much
worse
you
ve
no
reason
to
envy
me
my
country
life
by
the
way
and
there
s
no
sense
in
your
going
about
longing
for
the
little
church
of
your
childhood
with
its
moses
and
hymns
and
god
well
longing
does
no
harm
perhaps
but
don
t
ever
try
to
find
it
the
fact
is
old
fellow
that
such
things
are
not
to
be
found
any
more
i
take
it
that
religion
had
the
same
power
on
you
in
your
childhood
as
it
had
with
me
we
were
wild
young
scamps
both
of
us
but
we
liked
going
to
church
not
for
the
sake
of
the
sermons
but
to
bow
our
heads
when
the
hymn
arose
and
join
in
singing
it
when
the
waves
of
the
rolled
through
the
church
it
seemed
to
me
at
least
as
if
something
were
set
swelling
in
my
own
soul
bearing
me
away
to
lands
and
kingdoms
where
all
at
last
was
as
it
should
be
and
when
we
went
out
into
the
world
we
went
with
some
echo
of
the
hymn
in
our
hearts
and
we
might
curse
jehovah
but
in
a
corner
of
our
minds
the
hymn
lived
on
as
a
craving
a
hunger
for
some
all
through
the
busy
day
we
might
bear
our
part
in
the
roaring
song
of
the
steel
but
in
the
evenings
on
our
lonely
couch
another
power
would
come
forth
in
our
minds
the
hunger
for
the
infinite
the
longing
to
be
cradled
and
borne
up
on
the
waves
of
eternity
whose
way
is
past
all
finding
out
never
believe
though
that
you
ll
find
the
church
of
your
childhood
now
in
any
of
our
country
places
we
have
electric
light
now
everywhere
telephones
separators
labour
unions
and
political
meetings
but
the
church
stands
empty
i
have
been
there
the
organ
wails
as
if
it
had
the
toothache
the
precentor
sneezes
out
a
hymn
the
congregation
does
not
lift
the
roof
off
with
its
voice
for
the
very
good
reason
that
there
is
no
congregation
there
and
the
priest
poor
devil
stands
up
in
his
pulpit
with
his
black
moustache
and
he
is
an
officer
in
the
army
reserve
and
he
reads
out
his
highly
rational
remarks
from
a
manuscript
but
his
face
says
all
the
time
you
two
paupers
down
there
that
make
up
my
congregation
you
don
t
believe
a
word
i
am
saying
but
never
mind
i
don
t
believe
it
it
s
a
tragic
business
when
people
have
outgrown
their
own
conception
of
the
divine
and
we
we
are
certainly
better
than
jehovah
the
dogma
of
the
atonement
based
on
original
sin
and
the
bloodthirstiness
of
god
is
revolting
to
us
we
shrug
our
shoulders
and
turn
away
with
a
smile
or
in
disgust
we
are
not
angels
yet
but
we
are
too
good
to
worship
such
a
god
as
that
there
is
some
excuse
for
the
priest
of
course
he
must
preach
of
some
god
and
he
has
no
other
altogether
it
s
hardly
surprising
that
even
ignorant
peasants
shake
their
heads
and
give
the
church
a
wide
berth
what
do
they
do
on
sundays
then
my
dear
fellow
they
have
no
sunday
they
sit
nodding
their
heads
over
a
long
table
waiting
for
the
day
to
pass
they
remind
one
of
plough
horses
that
have
filled
their
bellies
and
stand
snoring
softly
because
there
s
no
work
today
the
great
evolutionary
scheme
with
its
wonders
of
steel
and
miracles
of
science
goes
marching
on
victoriously
i
grant
you
changing
the
face
of
the
world
hurrying
its
pulse
to
a
more
and
more
feverish
beat
but
what
good
will
it
do
the
peasant
to
be
able
to
fly
through
the
air
on
his
wheelbarrow
while
no
temple
no
holy
day
is
left
him
any
more
on
earth
what
errand
can
he
have
up
among
the
clouds
while
yet
no
heaven
arches
above
his
soul
this
is
the
burning
question
with
all
of
us
with
you
in
the
desert
as
with
us
up
here
under
the
pole
to
me
it
seems
that
we
need
one
who
will
make
our
religion
new
not
merely
a
new
prophet
but
a
new
god
you
ask
about
my
health
well
i
fancy
it
s
too
early
yet
to
speak
about
it
but
so
much
i
will
say
if
you
should
ever
be
in
pain
and
suffering
take
it
out
on
yourself
not
on
others
greetings
from
us
all
yours

chapter
iv
christmas
was
near
the
days
were
all
grey
twilight
and
there
was
a
frost
that
set
the
cracking
the
children
went
about
blue
with
cold
when
merle
scrubbed
the
floors
they
turned
into
small
though
there
might
be
a
big
fire
in
the
stove
peer
waded
and
waded
through
deep
snow
to
the
well
for
water
and
his
beard
hung
like
a
wreath
of
icicles
about
his
face
aye
this
was
a
winter
old
raastad
s
two
daughters
were
in
the
dairy
making
the
door
was
flung
open
there
was
a
rush
of
frosty
air
and
peer
stood
there
blinking
his
eyes
huh
what
smokers
you
two
are
are
we
now
and
the
one
and
the
one
both
giggled
and
they
looked
at
each
other
and
nodded
this
queer
of
theirs
never
came
near
them
that
he
didn
t
crack
jokes
by
the
way
else
i
dreamed
last
night
that
we
were
going
to
be
both
the
girls
shrieked
with
delight
at
this
and
mari
you
were
married
to
the
oh
my
that
old
creature
down
at
moen
he
was
much
older
ninety
years
old
he
uf
you
re
always
at
your
nonsense
said
the
girl
stirring
away
at
her
huge
steaming
cauldron
peer
went
out
again
the
girls
were
hardly
out
of
their
teens
and
yet
their
faces
seemed
set
already
and
stiff
with
earnestness
and
whenever
peer
had
managed
to
set
them
laughing
unawares
they
seemed
frightened
the
next
minute
at
having
been
betrayed
into
doing
something
there
was
no
profit
in
peer
strode
about
in
the
crackling
snow
with
his
fur
cap
drawn
down
over
his
ears
jotunheim
itself
lay
there
up
north
breathing
an
cold
out
over
the
world
and
he
was
he
to
go
on
like
this
growing
hunchbacked
under
a
burden
that
weighed
and
bowed
him
down
continually
why
the
devil
could
he
not
shake
it
off
break
away
from
it
and
kick
out
bravely
at
his
evil
fate
peer
asked
merle
standing
in
the
kitchen
what
did
you
think
of
giving
the
children
for
a
christmas
present
oh
a
palace
each
and
a
horse
to
ride
of
course
when
you
ve
more
money
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
the
devil
take
economy
and
what
about
you
my
girl
any
objection
to
a
couple
of
thousand
crowns
worth
of
furs
no
but
seriously
the
children
haven
t
any
ski
nor
a
well
have
you
the
money
to
buy
them
i
haven
suppose
you
tried
making
them
yourself
ski
peer
turned
over
the
notion
whistling
well
why
not
and
a
sleigh
we
might
manage
that
but
what
about
little
asta
she
s
too
little
for
that
sort
of
she
hasn
t
any
bed
for
her
peer
whistled
again
there
s
something
in
that
that
s
an
idea
i
m
not
so
handless
yet
that
i
couldn
t
he
was
soon
hard
at
it
there
were
tools
and
a
joiner
s
bench
in
an
outhouse
and
there
he
worked
he
grew
easily
tired
his
feet
tried
constantly
to
take
him
to
the
door
but
he
forced
himself
to
go
on
is
there
anything
in
the
notion
that
a
man
can
get
well
by
simply
willing
it
i
will
will
will
the
thought
of
others
besides
himself
began
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
those
birds
of
prey
ravening
in
his
head
presents
for
the
children
presents
that
father
had
made
himself
the
picture
made
light
and
warmth
in
his
mind
drive
ahead
then
when
it
came
to
making
the
iron
ribbons
for
the
sleigh
runners
he
had
to
go
across
to
the
smithy
and
there
stood
a
cottar
at
work
roughing
horseshoes
red
glowing
iron
once
more
and
steel
the
clang
of
hammer
on
anvil
seemed
to
tear
his
ears
yet
it
drew
him
on
too
it
was
long
since
last
he
heard
that
sound
and
there
were
memories
want
this
welded
jens
where
s
the
borax
look
here
this
is
the
way
of
might
ha
been
born
and
bred
a
smith
said
jens
as
he
watched
the
deft
and
easy
christmas
eve
came
and
the
grey
dragged
up
a
big
wooden
case
to
the
door
peer
opened
it
and
carried
in
the
things
a
whole
heap
of
good
things
for
christmas
from
the
ringeby
relations
he
bit
his
lips
when
he
saw
all
the
bags
piled
up
on
the
kitchen
table
there
had
been
a
time
not
long
ago
when
merle
and
he
had
loaded
up
a
sledge
at
the
loreng
storehouse
and
driven
off
with
christmas
gifts
to
all
the
poor
folk
round
it
was
part
of
the
season
s
fun
for
them
and
now
now
they
must
even
be
glad
to
receive
presents
themselves
merle
have
we
nothing
we
can
give
away
this
year
i
don
t
know
what
do
you
think
a
poor
man
s
christmas
it
ll
be
with
a
vengeance
if
we
re
only
to
take
presents
and
haven
t
the
least
little
thing
to
give
merle
sighed
we
must
hope
it
won
t
happen
to
us
again
she
said
i
won
t
have
it
happen
to
us
now
he
said
pacing
up
and
down
there
s
that
poor
devil
of
a
joiner
down
at
moen
with
consumption
i
m
going
down
there
with
a
bit
of
a
parcel
to
chuck
in
at
his
door
if
i
have
to
take
your
shift
and
the
shirt
off
my
back
you
know
yourself
it
won
t
be
any
christmas
at
all
if
we
don
t
do
well
if
you
like
i
ll
see
if
we
can
t
find
something
among
the
children
s
clothes
that
they
can
do
the
end
of
it
was
that
merle
levied
toll
on
all
the
parcels
from
home
both
rice
and
raisins
and
cakes
and
made
up
little
packets
of
them
to
send
round
by
him
that
was
merle
s
way
let
her
alone
and
she
would
hit
upon
something
the
snow
creaked
and
crackled
underfoot
as
peer
went
off
on
his
errand
a
starry
sky
and
a
biting
wind
and
light
upon
light
from
the
windows
of
the
farms
scattered
over
the
dark
hillsides
high
above
all
against
the
sky
there
was
one
little
gleam
that
might
be
a
cottage
window
or
might
be
a
star
peer
was
flushed
and
freshened
up
when
he
came
back
into
the
warmth
of
the
room
and
a
chorus
of
joyful
shouts
was
raised
when
merle
announced
to
the
children
father
s
going
to
bath
you
all
the
end
of
a
barrel
was
the
and
peer
stood
in
the
kitchen
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
holding
the
naked
little
bodies
as
they
sprawled
about
in
the
steaming
water
mother
was
busy
with
something
or
other
in
the
but
it
was
a
great
secret
and
the
children
were
very
mysterious
about
it
no
no
you
mustn
t
go
in
they
said
to
little
asta
who
went
whimpering
for
her
mother
to
the
door
and
later
in
the
evening
when
the
was
lit
up
and
the
windows
shone
white
with
frost
there
were
great
doings
all
about
the
sitting
room
floor
louise
got
her
ski
on
and
immediately
fell
on
her
face
lorentz
astride
of
the
new
sleigh
was
shouting
hi
hi
clear
the
course
there
and
over
in
a
corner
sat
little
asta
busy
putting
her
baby
to
bed
and
singing
it
to
sleep
husband
and
wife
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
what
did
i
tell
you
said
merle
slowly
with
torturing
slowness
the
winter
days
creep
by
for
two
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
there
is
pale
twilight
for
two
hours
then
darkness
again
through
the
long
nights
the
north
wind
howls
funeral
dirges
and
piles
up
the
snow
into
great
drifts
across
the
road
deep
enough
almost
to
smother
a
sleigh
and
its
driver
the
days
and
nights
come
and
go
monotonous
unchanged
the
same
icy
grey
daylight
and
never
a
human
soul
to
speak
to
across
the
valley
a
great
solid
mountain
wall
hems
you
in
and
you
gaze
at
it
till
it
nearly
drives
you
mad
if
only
one
could
bore
a
hole
through
it
and
steal
a
glimpse
of
the
world
beyond
or
could
climb
up
to
the
topmost
ridge
and
for
a
moment
look
far
round
to
a
wide
horizon
and
breathe
freely
once
more
at
last
one
day
the
grey
veil
lifts
a
little
a
strip
of
blue
sky
appears
and
hearts
grow
lighter
at
the
sight
the
snow
peaks
to
the
south
turn
golden
what
is
it
actually
the
sun
and
day
by
day
now
a
belt
of
gold
grows
broader
comes
lower
and
lower
on
the
hillside
till
the
farms
are
steeped
in
it
and
glow
red
and
at
last
one
day
the
red
flame
reaches
the
courthouse
and
shines
in
across
the
floor
of
the
room
where
merle
is
sitting
by
the
window
patching
the
seat
of
a
tiny
pair
of
trousers
what
life
and
cheer
it
brings
with
it
mother
here
s
the
sun
cries
louise
joyfully
from
the
doorway
yes
child
i
see
but
louise
has
only
looked
in
for
a
moment
to
beg
some
cake
for
lorentz
and
herself
and
be
off
again
on
her
ski
to
the
thank
you
mother
you
re
a
darling
and
with
a
slice
in
each
hand
she
dashes
out
glowing
with
health
and
the
cold
air
if
only
peer
could
glow
with
health
again
but
though
one
day
they
might
persuade
themselves
that
now
now
at
last
he
had
turned
the
corner
the
next
he
would
be
lying
tossing
about
in
misery
and
it
all
seemed
more
hopeless
than
ever
he
had
taken
to
the
doctors
medicines
again
arsenic
and
iron
and
so
forth
and
the
quiet
and
fresh
air
they
had
prescribed
were
here
in
plenty
would
nothing
do
him
any
good
there
were
not
so
many
months
of
their
year
left
now
and
then
another
winter
here
and
living
on
charity
ah
me
merle
shook
her
head
and
sighed
the
time
had
come
too
when
louise
should
go
to
school
send
the
children
over
to
me
all
three
of
them
if
you
like
wrote
aunt
marit
from
bruseth
no
thanks
merle
knew
what
that
meant
aunt
marit
wanted
to
keep
them
for
good
lose
her
children
give
away
her
children
to
others
was
the
day
to
come
when
that
burden
too
would
be
laid
upon
them
but
schooling
they
must
have
they
must
learn
enough
at
least
to
fit
them
to
make
a
living
when
they
grew
up
and
if
their
own
parents
could
not
afford
them
schooling
why
why
then
perhaps
they
had
no
right
to
keep
them
merle
sewed
and
sewed
on
lifting
her
head
now
and
again
so
that
the
sunlight
fell
on
her
face
how
the
snow
shone
like
purple
under
the
red
flood
of
sunlight
after
all
their
troubles
seemed
a
little
easier
to
bear
it
was
as
if
something
frozen
in
her
heart
were
beginning
to
thaw
louise
was
getting
on
well
with
her
violin
perhaps
one
day
the
child
might
go
out
into
the
world
and
win
the
triumphs
that
her
mother
had
dreamed
of
in
vain
there
was
a
sound
of
hurried
steps
in
the
passage
and
she
started
and
sat
in
suspense
would
he
come
in
raging
or
in
despair
or
had
the
pains
in
his
head
come
back
the
door
opened
merle
i
have
it
now
by
all
the
gods
little
woman
something
s
happened
at
last
merle
half
rose
from
her
seat
but
sank
back
again
gazing
at
his
face
i
ve
got
it
this
time
merle
he
said
again
and
how
on
earth
i
never
hit
on
it
before
when
it
s
as
simple
as
shelling
peas
he
was
stalking
about
the
room
now
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
whistling
but
what
is
it
peer
why
you
see
i
was
standing
there
chopping
wood
and
all
the
time
swarms
of
mowing
machines
nine
million
of
them
were
going
in
my
head
all
with
the
grass
sticking
fast
to
the
shears
and
clogging
them
up
i
was
in
a
cold
sweat
i
felt
myself
going
straight
to
hell
and
then
in
a
flash
a
flash
of
steel
it
came
to
me
it
means
salvation
for
us
merle
oh
do
talk
so
that
i
can
understand
a
little
of
what
you
re
why
don
t
you
see
all
that
s
wanted
is
a
small
movable
steel
brush
above
the
shears
to
flick
away
the
grass
and
keep
them
clear
hang
it
all
a
child
could
see
it
by
jove
little
woman
it
ll
soon
be
changed
times
with
us
merle
laid
her
work
down
in
her
lap
and
let
her
hands
fall
if
this
were
true
i
ll
have
the
machine
up
here
merle
making
the
brushes
and
fixing
them
on
will
be
no
trouble
at
all
i
can
do
it
in
a
day
in
the
smithy
what
you
had
better
try
you
re
just
beginning
to
get
a
little
better
and
you
want
to
spoil
it
all
again
i
shall
never
get
well
merle
as
long
as
i
have
that
infernal
machine
in
my
head
balancing
between
and
fiasco
it
presses
on
my
brain
like
a
leaden
weight
i
shall
never
have
a
decent
night
s
sleep
till
i
get
rid
of
it
oh
my
great
god
if
times
were
to
change
some
day
even
for
us
well
do
you
think
i
wouldn
t
get
well
when
that
day
came
this
time
she
let
him
take
her
in
his
arms
but
when
he
had
gone
she
sat
still
watching
the
sun
sink
behind
the
till
her
eyes
grew
dim
and
her
breath
came
heavily
a
week
later
when
the
sun
was
flaming
on
the
white
roofs
the
grey
pony
dragged
a
huge
up
to
raastad
and
the
same
day
a
noise
of
hammer
and
file
at
work
was
heard
in
the
smithy
what
do
a
few
sleepless
nights
matter
now
and
they
are
sleepless
not
so
much
from
anxiety
for
this
time
things
go
well
as
because
of
dreams
and
both
of
them
dream
they
have
bought
back
loreng
and
they
wander
about
through
the
great
light
rooms
once
more
and
all
is
peace
and
happiness
all
the
evil
days
before
are
as
a
nightmare
that
is
past
once
more
they
will
be
young
go
out
on
ski
together
and
dine
together
after
and
drink
champagne
and
look
at
each
other
with
love
in
their
eyes
once
more
and
many
times
again
peer
and
sleep
day
after
day
the
hammering
went
on
in
the
smithy
a
few
years
back
he
could
have
finished
the
whole
business
in
a
couple
of
days
but
now
half
an
hour
s
work
was
enough
to
tire
him
out
it
is
exhausting
work
to
concentrate
your
thoughts
upon
a
single
point
when
your
brain
has
long
been
used
to
play
idly
with
stray
fancies
as
they
came
he
found
too
that
there
were
defects
to
be
put
right
in
the
parts
he
thought
were
complete
before
and
he
had
no
assistants
now
no
foundry
to
get
castings
from
he
must
forge
out
each
piece
with
his
own
hands
and
with
sorry
tools
what
did
it
matter
he
began
to
discipline
his
brain
denying
himself
every
superfluous
thought
he
drew
dark
curtains
across
every
window
in
his
consciousness
save
one
the
machine
after
half
an
hour
s
work
he
would
go
back
to
bed
and
rest
just
close
his
eyes
and
rest
this
too
was
discipline
again
he
flooded
all
his
mind
with
darkness
darkness
to
save
his
strength
for
the
of
work
next
day
was
merle
fearful
and
anxious
at
all
events
she
said
no
word
about
the
work
that
so
absorbed
him
he
was
excited
enough
as
it
was
and
now
when
he
was
irritable
and
angry
with
the
children
she
did
not
even
look
at
him
reproachfully
they
must
bear
it
both
she
and
the
children
it
would
soon
be
all
over
now
in
the
clear
moonlight
nights
when
the
children
were
in
bed
the
two
would
sometimes
be
seen
wandering
about
together
they
went
with
their
arms
about
each
other
s
waists
talking
loudly
laughing
a
great
deal
and
sometimes
singing
people
going
by
on
the
road
would
hear
the
laughter
and
singing
and
think
to
themselves
it
s
either
someone
that
s
been
drinking
or
else
that
couple
from
the
the
spring
drew
on
and
the
days
grew
lighter
but
at
the
hamar
agricultural
exhibition
where
the
machine
was
tried
an
american
competitor
was
found
to
be
just
a
little
better
everyone
thought
it
a
queer
business
for
even
if
the
idea
hadn
t
been
directly
stolen
from
peer
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
machine
had
suggested
it
the
principles
adopted
were
the
same
in
both
cases
but
in
the
american
machine
there
was
just
enough
improvement
in
carrying
them
out
to
make
it
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
any
use
going
to
law
over
the
patent
rights
and
besides
it
s
no
light
matter
for
a
man
with
no
money
at
his
back
to
go
to
law
with
a
rich
american
firm
in
the
mighty
race
with
competitors
the
wide
world
over
to
produce
the
best
machine
peer
had
been
on
the
very
point
of
winning
another
man
had
climbed
upon
his
chariot
and
then
at
the
last
moment
jumped
a
few
feet
ahead
and
had
thereby
won
the
prize
so
that
the
achievement
in
itself
be
good
the
world
does
not
inquire
too
curiously
whether
it
was
honestly
achieved
and
there
is
no
use
starting
a
company
to
exploit
a
new
machine
when
there
is
a
better
machine
in
the
field
the
steel
had
seized
on
peer
and
used
him
as
a
springboard
but
the
reward
was
destined
for
another
chapter
v
herr
uthoug
junior
agent
for
english
tweeds
stepped
out
of
the
train
one
warm
day
in
july
and
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
station
platform
looking
about
him
magnificent
scenery
certainly
and
this
beautiful
valley
was
where
his
sister
had
been
living
for
more
than
a
year
splendid
air
and
yet
somehow
it
didn
t
seem
to
have
done
his
much
good
well
well
and
the
neatly
dressed
young
gentleman
set
off
on
foot
towards
raastad
asking
his
way
from
time
to
time
he
wanted
to
take
them
by
surprise
there
had
been
a
family
council
at
ringeby
and
they
had
agreed
that
some
definite
arrangement
must
be
made
for
the
future
of
the
sister
and
her
husband
with
whom
things
had
gone
so
hopelessly
wrong
as
he
turned
up
the
that
led
to
the
farm
he
was
aware
of
a
man
in
his
wheeling
a
barrow
full
of
stones
what
he
thought
could
he
be
mistaken
no
sure
enough
it
was
peer
holm
peer
holm
loading
up
stones
and
wheeling
them
down
the
hill
as
zealously
as
if
he
were
paid
for
every
step
the
agent
was
not
the
man
for
lamentations
or
condolences
hullo
he
cried
hard
at
it
aren
t
you
you
ve
taken
to
farming
i
peer
stood
up
straight
wiped
his
hands
on
his
trousers
and
came
towards
him
good
heavens
how
old
he
has
grown
thought
uthoug
to
himself
but
aloud
he
said
well
you
do
look
fit
i
d
hardly
have
known
you
merle
caught
sight
of
the
pair
from
the
kitchen
window
why
i
do
believe
she
exclaimed
and
came
running
out
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
seen
any
of
her
people
that
she
forgot
her
dignity
and
in
a
moment
had
her
arms
round
her
brother
s
neck
hugging
him
no
certainly
uthoug
junior
had
not
come
with
lamentations
and
condolences
he
had
a
bottle
of
good
wine
in
his
bag
and
at
supper
he
filled
the
glasses
and
drank
with
them
both
and
talked
about
theatres
and
variety
shows
and
gave
imitations
of
actors
till
he
had
set
the
two
poor
harassed
creatures
laughing
they
must
need
a
little
joy
and
laughter
ah
well
he
knew
how
they
must
need
it
but
he
knew
too
that
merle
and
peer
were
on
tenterhooks
waiting
to
know
what
the
family
had
decided
about
their
future
the
days
of
their
life
here
had
been
evil
and
sad
but
they
only
hoped
now
that
they
might
be
able
to
stay
on
if
the
help
they
had
received
up
to
now
were
taken
from
them
they
could
neither
afford
to
stay
here
nor
to
go
elsewhere
what
then
could
they
do
no
wonder
they
were
anxious
as
they
sat
there
after
supper
he
went
out
for
a
stroll
with
peer
while
merle
waited
at
home
in
suspense
she
understood
that
their
fate
was
being
settled
as
she
waited
at
last
they
returned
and
to
her
astonishment
they
came
in
laughing
her
brother
said
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
patted
her
arm
and
was
kindness
itself
she
took
him
up
to
his
room
and
would
have
liked
to
sit
there
a
while
and
talk
to
him
but
she
knew
peer
had
waited
till
they
were
alone
to
tell
her
the
news
that
concerned
them
so
nearly
then
carsten
she
said
to
her
brother
and
went
downstairs
and
then
at
last
she
and
peer
were
sitting
alone
together
at
her
by
the
window
well
said
merle
the
thing
is
this
merle
if
we
have
courage
to
live
at
all
we
must
look
facts
in
the
face
as
they
yes
dear
but
tell
me
and
the
facts
are
that
with
my
health
as
it
now
is
i
can
not
possibly
get
any
employment
it
is
certain
that
i
can
not
and
as
that
is
the
case
we
may
as
well
be
here
as
anywhere
but
can
we
stay
on
here
peer
if
you
can
bear
to
stay
with
a
miserable
bungler
like
me
that
of
course
is
a
answer
me
can
we
stay
here
yes
but
it
may
be
years
merle
before
i
m
fit
to
work
again
we
ve
got
to
reckon
with
that
and
to
live
on
charity
year
after
year
is
what
i
can
not
and
will
not
but
what
are
we
to
do
then
peer
there
seems
to
be
no
possible
way
for
me
to
earn
any
i
can
try
at
any
rate
he
answered
looking
out
of
the
window
you
oh
no
peer
even
if
you
could
get
work
as
a
draughtsman
you
know
quite
well
that
your
eyes
would
never
stand
i
can
do
blacksmith
s
work
he
said
there
was
a
pause
merle
glanced
at
him
involuntarily
as
if
she
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
could
he
be
in
earnest
was
the
engineer
of
the
nile
barrage
to
sink
into
a
country
blacksmith
she
sighed
but
she
felt
she
must
not
dishearten
him
and
at
last
she
said
with
an
effort
it
would
help
to
pass
the
time
i
daresay
and
perhaps
you
would
get
into
the
way
of
sleeping
she
looked
out
of
the
window
with
tightly
compressed
lips
and
if
i
do
that
merle
we
can
t
stay
on
in
this
house
in
fact
a
great
box
of
a
place
like
this
is
too
big
for
us
in
any
case
when
you
haven
t
even
a
maid
to
help
but
do
you
know
of
any
smaller
house
we
could
take
yes
there
s
a
little
place
for
sale
with
a
rood
or
two
of
ground
if
we
had
a
cow
and
a
pig
merle
and
a
few
fowls
and
could
raise
a
bushel
or
two
of
corn
and
if
i
could
earn
a
few
shillings
a
week
in
the
smithy
we
wouldn
t
come
on
the
parish
at
any
rate
i
could
manage
the
little
jobs
that
i
d
get
in
fact
pottering
about
at
them
would
do
me
good
what
do
you
say
merle
did
not
answer
her
eyes
were
turned
away
gazing
fixedly
out
of
the
window
but
there
s
another
question
about
you
merle
are
you
willing
to
sink
along
with
me
into
a
life
like
that
i
shall
be
all
right
i
lived
in
just
such
a
place
when
i
was
a
boy
but
you
honestly
merle
i
don
t
think
i
should
ask
it
of
his
voice
began
to
tremble
he
pressed
his
lips
together
and
his
eyes
avoided
her
face
there
was
a
pause
how
about
the
money
she
said
at
last
how
will
you
buy
the
place
your
brother
has
promised
to
arrange
about
a
loan
but
i
say
again
merle
i
shall
not
blame
you
in
the
least
if
you
would
rather
go
and
live
with
your
aunt
at
bruseth
i
fancy
she
d
be
glad
to
have
you
and
the
children
again
there
was
silence
for
a
while
then
she
said
if
there
are
two
decent
rooms
in
the
cottage
we
could
be
comfortable
enough
and
as
you
say
it
would
be
easier
to
look
peer
waited
a
little
there
was
something
in
his
throat
that
prevented
speech
he
understood
now
that
it
was
to
be
taken
for
granted
without
words
that
they
should
not
part
company
and
it
took
him
a
little
time
to
get
over
the
discovery
merle
sat
facing
him
but
her
eyes
were
turned
to
the
window
as
before
she
had
still
the
same
beautiful
dark
eyebrows
but
her
face
was
faded
and
worn
and
there
were
streaks
of
grey
in
her
hair
at
last
he
spoke
again
and
about
the
children
she
started
the
children
what
about
them
had
it
come
at
last
the
thing
she
had
gone
in
fear
of
so
long
aunt
marit
has
sent
word
to
ask
if
we
will
let
your
brother
take
louise
over
to
stay
with
no
merle
flung
out
no
peer
surely
you
said
no
at
once
surely
you
wouldn
t
let
her
go
you
know
what
it
means
their
wanting
to
have
her
over
i
know
he
nodded
but
there
s
another
question
in
louise
s
own
interest
have
we
any
right
to
say
no
peer
she
cried
springing
up
and
wringing
her
hands
you
mustn
t
ask
it
of
me
you
don
t
want
to
do
it
yourself
surely
we
have
not
come
to
that
to
begin
sending
giving
away
no
no
no
she
moaned
do
you
hear
me
peer
i
can
not
do
as
you
please
merle
he
said
rising
and
forcing
himself
to
speak
calmly
we
can
think
it
over
at
any
rate
till
your
brother
leaves
tomorrow
there
are
two
sides
to
the
thing
one
way
of
it
may
hurt
us
now
the
other
way
may
be
a
very
serious
matter
for
louise
poor
next
morning
when
it
was
time
to
wake
the
children
peer
and
merle
went
into
the
nursery
together
they
stopped
by
louise
s
bed
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
the
child
had
grown
a
great
deal
since
they
came
to
raastad
she
lay
now
with
her
nose
buried
in
the
pillow
and
the
fair
hair
hiding
her
cheek
she
slept
so
soundly
and
securely
this
was
home
to
her
still
she
was
safer
with
father
and
mother
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
louise
said
merle
shaking
her
time
to
get
up
the
child
sat
up
still
half
asleep
and
looked
wonderingly
at
the
two
faces
what
was
it
make
haste
and
get
dressed
said
peer
fancy
you
re
going
off
with
uncle
carsten
today
to
see
aunt
marit
at
bruseth
what
do
you
say
to
that
the
little
girl
was
wide
awake
in
a
moment
and
hopped
out
of
bed
at
once
to
begin
dressing
but
there
was
something
in
her
parents
faces
which
a
little
subdued
her
joy
that
morning
there
was
much
whispering
among
the
children
the
two
youngest
looked
with
wondering
eyes
at
their
elder
sister
who
was
going
away
little
lorentz
gave
her
his
horse
as
a
keepsake
and
asta
gave
her
youngest
doll
and
merle
went
about
trying
to
make
believe
that
louise
was
only
going
on
a
short
visit
and
would
soon
be
coming
back
by
they
had
packed
a
little
trunk
and
louise
in
her
best
dress
was
rushing
about
saying
goodbye
all
round
the
farm
the
harvesters
whom
she
had
helped
to
drive
in
the
hay
coming
in
for
a
specially
affectionate
farewell
her
last
visit
was
to
musin
the
grey
horse
that
was
grazing
tethered
behind
the
smithy
musin
was
busy
cropping
the
turf
but
he
just
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
she
plucked
a
handful
of
grass
and
offered
it
and
when
he
had
disposed
of
that
she
patted
his
muzzle
and
he
let
her
cling
round
his
neck
for
a
moment
i
ll
be
sure
to
write
she
cried
out
to
no
one
in
particular
as
she
went
back
over
the
courtyard
again
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
taking
with
it
uthoug
junior
and
louise
each
waving
from
one
of
the
windows
of
the
compartment
and
peer
and
merle
were
left
on
the
platform
holding
their
two
youngest
children
by
the
hand
they
could
still
see
a
small
hand
with
a
white
handkerchief
waving
from
the
carriage
window
then
the
last
carriage
disappeared
into
the
cutting
and
the
smoke
and
the
rumble
of
the
train
were
all
that
was
left
the
four
that
were
left
behind
stood
still
for
a
little
while
but
they
seemed
to
have
moved
unconsciously
closer
together
than
before
chapter
vi
some
way
up
from
the
there
stands
a
little
house
with
three
small
windows
in
a
row
a
cowshed
on
one
side
of
it
and
a
smithy
on
the
other
when
smoke
rises
from
the
smithy
the
neighbours
say
the
engineer
must
be
a
bit
better
since
he
s
at
it
in
the
smithy
again
if
there
s
anything
you
want
done
you
d
better
take
it
to
him
he
doesn
t
charge
any
more
than
jens
up
at
merle
and
peer
had
been
living
here
a
couple
of
years
their
lives
had
gone
on
together
but
there
had
come
to
be
this
difference
between
them
merle
still
looked
constantly
at
her
husband
s
face
always
hoping
that
he
would
get
better
while
he
himself
had
no
longer
any
hope
even
when
the
thump
thumping
in
his
head
was
quiet
for
a
time
there
was
generally
some
trouble
somewhere
to
keep
him
on
the
rack
only
he
did
not
talk
about
it
any
more
he
looked
at
his
wife
s
face
and
thought
to
himself
she
is
changing
more
and
more
and
it
is
you
that
are
to
blame
you
have
poured
out
your
own
misery
on
her
day
and
night
it
is
time
now
you
tried
to
make
some
so
had
begun
a
struggle
to
keep
silence
to
endure
if
possible
to
laugh
even
when
he
could
have
found
it
in
his
heart
to
weep
it
was
difficult
enough
especially
at
first
but
each
victory
gained
brought
with
it
a
certain
satisfaction
which
strengthened
him
to
take
up
the
struggle
again
in
this
way
too
he
learned
to
look
on
his
fate
more
calmly
his
humour
grew
lighter
it
was
as
if
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
misfortune
in
the
eyes
saying
yes
i
know
i
am
defenceless
and
you
can
plunge
me
deeper
and
deeper
yet
but
for
all
that
if
i
choose
to
laugh
you
can
not
hinder
how
much
easier
all
things
seemed
now
that
he
looked
no
longer
for
any
good
to
come
to
him
and
urged
no
claims
against
anyone
either
in
heaven
or
on
earth
but
when
he
was
tired
out
with
his
work
at
the
forge
there
was
a
satisfaction
in
saying
to
his
wife
no
merle
didn
t
i
tell
you
i
wouldn
t
have
you
carrying
the
water
up
give
me
the
you
you
look
fit
for
it
don
t
you
hang
it
all
am
i
a
man
or
am
i
not
get
back
to
your
kitchen
that
s
the
place
for
a
so
he
carried
water
and
his
mood
was
the
brighter
for
it
though
he
might
feel
at
times
as
if
his
back
were
breaking
and
sometimes
i
m
feeling
lazy
merle
he
would
say
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
stay
in
bed
a
bit
and
she
understood
she
knew
from
experience
that
these
were
the
days
when
his
nightmare
headache
was
upon
him
and
that
it
was
to
spare
her
he
called
it
laziness
they
had
a
cow
now
and
a
pig
and
some
fowls
it
was
not
exactly
on
the
same
scale
as
at
loreng
but
it
had
the
advantage
that
he
could
manage
it
all
himself
last
year
they
had
raised
so
many
potatoes
that
they
had
been
able
to
sell
a
few
bushels
they
did
not
buy
eggs
any
more
they
sold
them
peer
carried
them
down
himself
to
the
local
dealer
sold
them
at
market
price
and
bought
things
they
might
need
with
the
money
why
not
merle
did
not
think
it
beneath
her
to
wash
and
scrub
and
do
the
cooking
true
enough
things
had
been
different
with
them
once
but
it
was
only
merle
now
who
ever
had
moments
of
dreaming
that
the
old
days
might
come
back
otherwise
for
both
him
and
her
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
washed
ashore
on
a
barren
coast
and
must
try
to
live
through
the
grey
days
as
best
they
could
it
would
happen
once
in
a
while
that
a
mowing
machine
of
the
new
american
type
would
be
sent
in
by
some
farmer
to
the
smithy
for
repairs
when
this
happened
peer
would
shut
his
lips
close
with
a
queer
expression
look
at
the
machine
for
a
moment
and
swallow
something
in
his
throat
the
man
who
had
stolen
this
thing
from
him
and
bettered
it
by
a
hairsbreadth
was
doubtless
a
millionaire
by
now
on
the
strength
of
it
it
cost
him
something
of
an
effort
to
take
these
repairs
in
hand
but
he
bowed
his
head
and
set
to
merle
poor
girl
needed
a
pair
of
shoes
at
times
too
he
would
turn
from
the
anvil
and
the
darkness
within
and
come
out
into
the
doorway
for
a
breath
of
air
and
here
he
would
look
out
upon
the
day
the
great
broad
empty
day
a
man
with
a
in
his
hands
instinctively
looks
up
at
the
heavens
he
has
inherited
that
instinct
from
his
great
ancestor
who
brought
down
fire
and
thought
to
men
and
taught
them
to
rebel
against
god
peer
looked
at
the
sky
and
at
the
clouds
sweeping
across
it
in
a
meaningless
turmoil
rebellion
against
someone
up
there
but
heaven
is
empty
there
is
no
one
to
rebel
against
but
then
all
the
injustice
the
manifold
iniquity
who
is
to
sit
in
judgment
on
it
at
the
great
day
who
no
one
what
think
of
the
millions
of
all
kinds
of
martyrs
who
died
under
the
bloodiest
torments
yet
innocent
as
babes
at
the
breast
is
there
to
be
no
day
of
reparation
for
them
none
but
there
must
be
a
whole
of
victims
of
injustice
whose
souls
flit
restlessly
around
because
they
died
under
a
weight
of
undeserved
shame
because
they
lost
a
battle
in
which
the
right
was
theirs
because
they
suffered
and
strove
for
truth
but
went
down
because
falsehood
was
the
stronger
truth
right
is
there
no
one
then
who
will
one
day
give
peace
to
the
dead
in
their
graves
and
set
things
in
their
right
places
is
there
no
one
no
one
the
world
rolls
on
its
way
fate
is
blind
and
god
smiles
while
satan
works
his
will
upon
job
hold
your
peace
and
grip
your
idiot
if
ever
your
conscience
should
embrace
the
universe
that
day
the
horror
of
it
would
strike
you
dead
remember
that
you
are
a
vertebrate
animal
and
it
is
by
mistake
that
you
have
developed
a
soul
cling
clang
the
red
sparks
fly
from
the
anvil
live
out
your
life
as
it
is
but
there
began
to
dawn
in
him
a
strange
longing
to
be
united
to
all
those
unfortunates
whom
fate
had
blindly
crushed
to
gather
them
together
not
to
a
common
lamentation
but
to
a
common
victory
not
for
vengeance
but
for
a
song
of
praise
behold
thou
eternal
omnipotence
how
we
requite
thy
cruelty
we
praise
life
see
how
much
more
godlike
we
are
than
thou
a
temple
a
temple
for
the
modern
spirit
of
man
hungry
for
eternity
not
for
the
babbling
of
prayers
but
for
a
hymn
from
man
s
munificent
heart
sent
pealing
up
to
heaven
will
it
come
will
it
one
day
be
built
one
evening
peer
came
home
from
the
apparently
in
high
spirits
hi
merle
i
ve
got
a
letter
from
the
bruseth
merle
glanced
at
lorentz
who
had
instinctively
come
close
to
her
and
was
looking
at
his
father
from
bruseth
how
is
louise
getting
on
she
asked
you
can
see
for
yourself
here
s
the
letter
said
he
merle
read
it
through
hurriedly
and
glanced
at
lorentz
once
more
that
evening
after
the
children
had
gone
to
bed
the
father
and
mother
sat
up
talking
together
in
a
low
voice
and
merle
had
to
admit
that
her
husband
was
right
it
would
be
selfish
of
them
to
keep
the
boy
here
when
he
might
be
heir
to
bruseth
some
day
if
they
let
him
go
suppose
he
stayed
and
worked
here
under
his
father
and
learned
to
be
a
smith
the
blacksmith
s
day
is
over
factories
do
all
the
work
now
and
what
schooling
could
he
get
away
here
in
the
country
aunt
marit
offered
to
send
him
to
a
good
and
so
the
die
was
cast
for
him
too
but
when
they
went
with
the
boy
to
see
him
off
at
the
station
the
mother
s
handkerchief
was
at
her
eyes
all
the
time
do
what
she
would
and
when
they
came
home
she
had
to
lie
down
in
bed
while
peer
went
about
the
place
humming
to
himself
while
he
got
ready
a
little
supper
and
brought
it
to
her
bedside
i
can
t
understand
how
you
can
take
it
so
easily
she
burst
out
no
no
he
laughed
a
little
oddly
the
less
said
about
that
the
better
but
the
next
day
it
was
peer
who
said
he
felt
lazy
again
and
would
lie
still
a
bit
merle
looked
at
him
and
stroked
his
forehead
and
the
time
went
on
they
worked
hard
and
constantly
to
make
both
ends
meet
without
help
and
they
were
content
to
take
things
as
they
came
when
the
big
dairy
was
started
close
by
he
made
a
good
deal
of
money
setting
up
the
plant
but
he
was
not
above
sharpening
a
drill
for
the
either
he
was
often
to
be
seen
going
down
to
the
country
store
in
a
sleeved
waistcoat
with
a
knapsack
on
his
back
he
carried
his
head
high
the
beard
was
shading
over
into
white
his
face
often
had
the
strained
look
that
comes
from
sleeplessness
but
his
step
was
light
and
he
still
had
a
joke
for
the
girls
whom
he
met
in
summer
the
neighbours
would
often
see
them
shutting
up
the
house
and
starting
off
up
the
hill
with
knapsack
and
and
with
little
asta
trotting
between
them
they
were
gone
it
might
be
to
try
and
recapture
some
memory
of
old
days
with
coffee
in
the
open
air
by
a
picnic
fire
in
the
autumn
when
the
great
fields
yellowed
all
the
hillsides
peer
and
merle
had
a
little
plot
of
their
own
that
showed
golden
too
the
dimensions
of
things
had
shrunk
not
a
little
for
these
two
a
bushel
of
corn
was
much
to
them
now
it
hit
them
hard
if
their
yielded
a
couple
of
measures
less
than
they
had
reckoned
on
but
the
housewives
from
the
farms
near
by
would
often
look
in
on
merle
to
see
how
bright
and
clean
she
kept
her
little
house
and
now
that
she
had
no
one
to
help
her
she
found
time
herself
to
teach
the
peasant
girls
something
of
cooking
and
sewing
but
one
habit
had
grown
upon
her
she
would
stand
long
and
long
by
the
window
looking
down
the
valley
to
where
the
hills
closed
it
in
it
was
as
if
she
were
looking
constantly
for
something
to
come
in
sight
something
that
should
bring
them
better
days
it
was
a
kind
of
sunday
for
her
to
stand
there
and
look
and
wait
and
the
time
went
on
chapter
vii
dear
klaus
brock
i
write
to
tell
you
of
what
has
lately
happened
to
us
here
chiefly
in
the
hope
that
it
may
be
some
comfort
to
yourself
for
i
have
discovered
dear
friend
that
this
of
ours
is
something
a
man
can
get
over
if
only
he
will
learn
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
not
with
those
of
others
most
men
would
say
things
have
steadily
gone
from
bad
to
worse
with
me
and
certainly
i
shall
not
pretend
to
feel
any
love
for
suffering
in
itself
on
the
contrary
it
hurts
it
does
not
ennoble
it
rather
brutalises
unless
it
becomes
so
great
that
it
embraces
all
things
i
was
once
engineer
in
charge
at
the
first
cataract
now
i
am
a
blacksmith
in
a
country
parish
and
that
hurts
i
am
cut
off
from
reading
because
of
my
eyes
and
from
intercourse
with
people
whose
society
would
be
a
pleasure
because
there
are
no
such
people
here
all
this
hurts
even
when
you
ve
grown
used
to
it
a
good
thing
in
itself
it
is
not
many
times
i
have
thought
that
we
must
have
reached
the
very
bottom
of
the
inclined
plane
of
adversity
but
always
it
proved
to
be
only
a
break
the
deepest
deep
was
still
to
come
you
work
on
even
when
your
head
feels
like
to
split
you
save
up
every
pin
every
match
and
yet
the
bread
you
eat
often
tastes
of
charity
that
hurts
you
give
up
hoping
that
things
may
be
better
some
day
you
give
up
all
hope
all
dreams
all
faith
all
illusions
surely
you
have
come
to
the
end
of
all
things
but
no
the
very
roots
of
one
s
being
are
still
left
the
most
precious
thing
of
all
is
still
left
what
can
that
be
you
ask
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
the
thing
that
happened
came
just
when
things
were
beginning
to
look
a
little
brighter
for
us
for
some
time
past
my
head
had
been
less
troublesome
and
i
had
got
to
work
on
a
new
harrow
steel
again
it
never
lets
one
rest
and
you
know
what
endless
possibilities
a
man
sees
in
a
thing
like
that
merle
was
working
with
fresh
courage
what
do
you
think
of
a
wife
like
that
taking
up
the
cross
of
her
own
free
will
to
go
on
sharing
the
life
of
a
ruined
man
i
hope
you
may
meet
a
woman
of
her
sort
one
day
true
her
hair
is
growing
grey
and
her
face
lined
her
figure
is
not
so
straight
as
once
it
was
her
hands
are
red
and
broken
and
yet
all
this
has
a
soul
of
its
own
a
beauty
of
its
own
in
my
eyes
because
i
know
that
each
wrinkle
is
a
mark
left
by
the
time
when
some
new
trouble
came
upon
us
and
found
us
together
then
one
day
she
smiles
and
her
smile
has
grown
strained
and
full
of
sadness
but
again
it
brings
back
to
me
times
when
both
heaven
and
earth
breathed
cold
upon
us
and
we
drew
closer
to
each
other
for
warmth
our
happiness
and
our
sufferings
have
moulded
her
into
what
she
now
is
the
world
may
think
perhaps
that
she
is
growing
old
to
me
she
is
only
more
beautiful
than
before
and
now
i
am
coming
to
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
you
will
understand
that
it
was
not
easy
to
send
away
the
two
children
and
it
doesn
t
make
things
better
to
get
letters
from
them
constantly
begging
us
to
let
them
come
home
again
but
we
had
still
one
little
girl
left
little
asta
who
was
just
five
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
if
you
were
a
father
and
your
tortured
nerves
had
often
made
you
harsh
and
unreasonable
with
the
two
elder
ones
you
would
try
would
you
not
to
make
it
up
in
to
the
one
that
was
left
asta
isn
t
it
pretty
imagine
a
sunburnt
little
being
with
black
hair
and
her
mother
s
beautiful
eyebrows
always
busy
with
her
dolls
or
fetching
in
wood
or
baking
little
cakes
of
her
own
for
father
when
mother
s
baking
bread
for
us
all
chattering
to
the
birds
on
the
roof
or
singing
now
and
then
just
because
some
stray
note
of
music
has
come
into
her
head
when
mother
is
busy
scrubbing
the
floor
little
asta
must
needs
get
hold
of
a
wet
rag
behind
her
back
and
slop
away
at
a
chair
until
she
has
got
herself
in
a
terrible
mess
and
then
she
gets
smacked
and
screams
for
a
moment
but
soon
runs
out
and
sings
herself
happy
again
when
you
re
at
work
in
the
smithy
there
comes
a
sound
of
little
feet
and
father
come
to
dinner
and
a
little
hand
takes
hold
of
you
and
leads
you
to
the
door
are
you
going
to
bath
me
father
or
here
s
your
napkin
and
though
there
might
be
only
potatoes
and
milk
for
dinner
she
would
eat
as
if
she
were
seated
at
the
grandest
banquet
aren
t
potatoes
and
milk
your
favourite
dish
father
and
she
makes
faces
at
you
in
the
eagerness
of
her
questionings
at
night
she
slept
in
a
box
at
the
foot
of
our
bed
and
when
i
was
lying
sleepless
it
would
often
happen
that
her
light
peaceful
breathing
filled
me
too
with
peace
and
it
was
as
if
her
little
hand
took
mine
and
led
me
on
to
sleep
itself
to
beautiful
divine
sleep
and
now
as
i
come
to
the
thing
that
happened
i
find
it
a
little
hard
to
write
my
hand
begins
to
tremble
but
my
hope
is
that
there
may
be
some
comfort
in
it
for
you
too
as
there
has
proved
to
be
for
merle
and
me
in
the
end
our
next
neighbours
here
were
a
brazier
and
his
wife
poor
folks
like
ourselves
soon
after
we
first
came
i
went
over
to
have
a
talk
with
him
i
found
him
a
poor
wizened
little
creature
pottering
about
with
his
acids
and
making
a
living
as
best
as
he
could
soldering
and
tinning
kettles
and
pans
what
do
you
want
he
asked
looking
askance
at
me
and
as
i
went
out
i
heard
him
bolt
the
door
behind
me
alas
he
was
afraid
afraid
that
i
was
come
to
snatch
his
daily
bread
from
him
his
wife
was
a
fleshy
lump
of
a
woman
insolent
enough
in
her
ways
though
she
had
just
been
in
prison
for
criminal
abetment
in
the
case
of
a
girl
that
had
got
into
trouble
one
sunday
morning
i
was
standing
looking
at
some
apple
trees
in
bloom
in
his
garden
one
of
them
grew
so
close
to
the
fence
that
the
branches
hung
over
on
my
side
and
i
bent
one
down
to
smell
the
blossom
then
suddenly
i
heard
a
cry
hi
tiger
catch
him
and
the
brazier
s
great
came
bounding
down
ready
to
fly
at
my
throat
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
hold
of
its
collar
before
it
could
do
me
any
harm
and
i
dragged
it
up
to
its
owner
and
told
him
that
if
anything
of
the
sort
happened
again
i
d
have
the
sheriff
s
officer
after
him
then
the
music
began
he
fairly
let
himself
go
and
told
me
what
he
thought
of
me
you
hold
your
jaw
you
cursed
pauper
coming
here
taking
the
bread
out
of
honest
working
people
s
mouths
and
so
on
he
hissed
it
out
flourishing
his
arms
about
and
at
last
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
fumbling
about
for
a
knife
or
something
to
throw
at
my
head
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
it
was
a
scene
in
the
grand
style
between
two
great
powers
in
the
a
couple
of
days
later
i
was
standing
at
the
forge
when
i
heard
a
shriek
from
my
wife
i
rushed
out
what
could
be
the
matter
merle
was
down
by
the
fence
already
and
all
at
once
i
saw
what
it
was
there
was
asta
lying
on
the
ground
under
the
body
of
a
great
beast
and
then
well
merle
tells
me
it
was
i
that
tore
the
thing
away
from
the
little
bundle
of
clothes
beneath
it
and
carried
our
little
girl
home
a
doctor
is
often
a
good
refuge
in
trouble
but
though
he
may
sew
up
a
ragged
tear
in
a
child
s
throat
ever
so
neatly
it
doesn
t
necessarily
follow
that
it
will
help
much
there
was
a
mother
though
that
would
not
let
him
go
that
cried
and
prayed
and
clung
about
him
begging
him
to
try
once
more
if
nothing
could
be
done
and
when
at
last
he
was
gone
she
was
always
for
going
after
him
again
and
grovelled
on
the
floor
and
tore
her
hair
could
not
would
not
believe
what
she
knew
was
true
and
that
night
a
father
and
mother
sat
up
together
staring
strangely
in
front
of
them
the
mother
was
quiet
now
the
child
was
laid
out
decked
and
ready
the
father
sat
by
the
window
looking
out
it
was
in
may
and
the
night
was
grey
now
it
was
that
i
began
to
realise
how
every
great
sorrow
leads
us
farther
and
farther
out
on
the
promontory
of
existence
i
had
come
to
the
outermost
point
now
there
was
no
more
and
i
discovered
too
dear
friend
that
these
many
years
of
adversity
had
shaped
me
not
in
one
but
in
various
moulds
for
i
had
in
me
the
stuff
for
several
quite
distinct
persons
and
now
the
work
was
done
and
they
could
break
free
from
my
being
and
go
their
several
ways
i
saw
a
man
rush
out
into
the
night
shaking
his
fist
at
heaven
and
earth
a
madman
who
refused
to
play
his
part
in
the
farce
any
more
and
so
rushed
down
towards
the
river
but
i
myself
sat
there
still
and
i
saw
another
a
puny
creature
let
loose
a
humble
ascetic
that
bent
his
head
and
bowed
under
the
lash
and
said
thy
will
be
done
the
lord
gave
the
lord
hath
taken
away
a
pitiful
being
this
that
stole
out
into
the
night
and
disappeared
but
i
myself
sat
there
still
i
sat
alone
on
the
promontory
of
existence
with
the
sun
and
the
stars
gone
out
and
emptiness
above
me
about
me
and
in
me
on
every
side
but
then
my
friend
by
degrees
it
dawned
on
me
that
there
was
still
something
left
there
was
one
little
indomitable
spark
in
me
that
began
to
glow
all
by
itself
it
was
as
if
i
were
lifted
back
to
the
first
day
of
existence
and
an
eternal
will
rose
up
in
me
and
said
let
there
be
light
this
will
it
was
that
by
and
by
grew
and
grew
in
me
and
made
me
strong
i
began
to
feel
an
unspeakable
compassion
for
all
men
upon
earth
and
yet
in
the
last
resort
i
was
proud
that
i
was
one
of
them
i
understood
how
blind
fate
can
strip
and
plunder
us
of
all
and
yet
something
will
remain
in
us
at
the
last
that
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
can
vanquish
our
bodies
are
doomed
to
die
and
our
spirit
to
be
extinguished
yet
still
we
bear
within
us
the
spark
the
germ
of
an
eternity
of
harmony
and
light
both
for
the
world
and
for
god
and
i
knew
now
that
what
i
had
hungered
after
in
my
best
years
was
neither
knowledge
nor
honour
nor
riches
nor
to
be
a
priest
or
a
great
creator
in
steel
no
friend
but
to
build
temples
not
chapels
for
prayers
or
churches
for
wailing
penitent
sinners
but
a
temple
for
the
human
spirit
in
its
grandeur
where
we
could
lift
up
our
souls
in
an
anthem
as
a
gift
to
heaven
i
could
never
do
this
now
perhaps
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
do
any
more
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
sat
there
that
i
had
conquered
what
happened
then
well
there
had
been
a
terrible
drought
all
that
spring
it
is
often
so
in
this
valley
the
eternal
north
wind
sent
the
dry
mould
sweeping
in
clouds
over
the
whole
countryside
and
we
were
threatened
with
one
of
our
worst
years
of
scarcity
if
the
rain
didn
t
come
at
last
people
ventured
to
sow
their
corn
but
then
the
frosts
set
in
and
snow
and
sleet
and
the
seed
froze
in
the
earth
my
neighbour
the
brazier
had
his
patch
of
ground
sown
with
barley
but
now
he
would
have
to
sow
it
again
and
where
was
he
to
get
the
seed
he
went
from
farm
to
farm
begging
for
some
but
people
hated
the
sight
of
him
after
what
had
happened
about
asta
no
one
would
lend
him
any
and
he
had
no
money
to
buy
the
boys
on
the
roads
hooted
after
him
and
some
of
the
neighbours
talked
of
driving
him
out
of
the
parish
i
wasn
t
able
to
sleep
much
the
next
night
either
and
when
the
clock
struck
two
i
got
up
where
are
you
going
asked
merle
i
want
to
see
if
we
haven
t
a
of
barley
left
i
said
barley
what
do
you
want
with
barley
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
want
to
sow
the
brazier
s
plot
with
it
i
said
and
it
s
best
to
do
it
now
so
that
nobody
will
know
it
was
she
sat
up
and
stared
at
me
what
his
the
the
brazier
s
yes
said
i
it
won
t
do
us
any
good
you
know
to
see
his
bit
of
field
lying
bare
all
peer
where
are
you
going
i
ve
told
you
said
i
and
went
out
but
i
knew
that
she
was
dressing
and
meant
to
come
too
it
had
rained
during
the
night
and
as
i
came
out
the
air
was
soft
and
easy
to
breathe
the
morning
still
lay
in
a
grey
with
yellow
gleams
from
the
to
the
north
the
scent
of
the
budding
birches
was
in
the
air
the
magpies
and
starlings
were
up
and
about
but
not
a
human
soul
was
to
be
seen
the
farms
were
asleep
the
whole
countryside
was
asleep
i
took
the
grain
in
a
basket
climbed
over
the
neighbour
s
fence
and
began
to
sow
no
sign
of
life
in
the
house
the
sheriff
s
officer
had
come
over
and
shot
the
dog
the
day
before
no
doubt
the
brazier
and
his
wife
were
lying
sleeping
dreaming
maybe
of
enemies
all
around
trying
their
best
to
do
them
harm
dear
friend
is
there
any
need
to
tell
the
rest
just
think
though
how
one
man
may
give
away
a
kingdom
and
it
costs
him
nothing
and
another
may
give
up
a
few
handfuls
of
corn
and
it
means
to
him
not
only
all
that
he
has
but
a
world
of
struggle
and
passion
before
he
can
bring
his
soul
to
make
that
gift
do
you
think
that
is
nothing
as
for
me
i
did
not
do
this
for
christ
s
sake
or
because
i
loved
my
enemy
but
because
standing
upon
the
ruins
of
my
life
i
felt
a
vast
responsibility
mankind
must
arise
and
be
better
than
the
blind
powers
that
order
its
ways
in
the
midst
of
its
sorrows
it
must
take
heed
that
the
does
not
die
the
spark
of
eternity
was
once
more
aglow
in
me
and
said
let
there
be
light
and
more
and
more
it
came
home
to
me
that
it
is
man
himself
that
must
create
the
divine
in
heaven
and
on
earth
that
that
is
his
triumph
over
the
dead
omnipotence
of
the
universe
therefore
i
went
out
and
sowed
the
corn
in
my
enemy
s
field
that
god
might
exist
ah
if
you
had
known
that
moment
it
was
as
if
the
air
about
me
grew
alive
with
voices
it
was
as
though
all
the
unfortunates
i
had
seen
and
known
were
bearing
me
company
more
and
more
they
came
the
dead
too
were
joined
to
us
an
army
from
times
past
and
long
ago
sister
louise
was
there
she
played
her
hymn
and
drew
the
voices
all
together
into
a
choir
the
choir
of
the
living
and
the
dead
the
choir
of
all
mankind
see
here
are
we
all
your
sisters
and
brothers
your
fate
is
ours
we
are
flung
by
the
indifferent
law
of
the
universe
into
a
life
that
we
can
not
order
as
we
would
we
are
ravaged
by
injustice
by
sickness
and
sorrow
by
fire
and
blood
even
the
happiest
must
die
in
his
own
home
he
is
but
on
a
visit
he
never
knows
but
that
he
may
be
gone
tomorrow
and
yet
man
smiles
and
laughs
in
the
face
of
his
tragic
fate
in
the
midst
of
his
thraldom
he
has
created
the
beautiful
on
earth
in
the
midst
of
his
torments
he
has
had
so
much
surplus
energy
of
soul
that
he
has
sent
it
radiating
forth
into
the
cold
deeps
of
space
and
warmed
them
with
god
so
marvellous
art
thou
o
spirit
of
man
so
godlike
in
thy
very
nature
thou
dost
reap
death
and
in
return
thou
sowest
the
dream
of
everlasting
life
in
revenge
for
thine
evil
fate
thou
dost
fill
the
universe
with
an
god
we
bore
our
part
in
his
creation
all
we
who
now
are
dust
we
who
sank
down
into
the
dark
like
flames
gone
out
we
wept
we
exulted
we
felt
the
ecstasy
and
the
agony
but
each
of
us
brought
our
ray
to
the
mighty
sea
of
light
each
of
us
from
the
negro
setting
up
the
first
mark
above
the
grave
of
his
dead
to
the
genius
raising
the
pillars
of
a
temple
towards
heaven
we
bore
our
part
from
the
poor
mother
praying
beside
a
cradle
to
the
hosts
that
lifted
their
songs
of
praise
high
up
into
boundless
space
honour
to
thee
o
spirit
of
man
thou
givest
a
soul
to
the
world
thou
settest
it
a
goal
thou
art
the
hymn
that
lifts
it
into
harmony
therefore
turn
back
into
thyself
lift
high
thy
head
and
meet
proudly
the
evil
that
comes
to
thee
adversity
can
crush
thee
death
can
blot
thee
out
yet
art
thou
still
unconquerable
and
eternal
dear
friend
it
was
thus
i
felt
and
when
the
corn
was
sown
and
i
went
back
the
sun
was
glancing
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
there
by
the
fence
stood
merle
looking
at
me
she
had
drawn
a
kerchief
forward
over
her
brow
after
the
fashion
of
the
peasant
women
so
that
her
face
was
in
shadow
but
she
smiled
to
me
as
if
she
too
the
stricken
mother
had
risen
up
from
the
ocean
of
her
suffering
that
here
in
the
daybreak
she
might
take
her
share
in
the
creating
