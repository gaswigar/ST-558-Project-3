apocalypse
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
nobody
either
in
capri
or
naples
ever
remembered
his
name
was
setting
out
with
his
wife
and
daughter
for
the
old
world
to
spend
there
two
years
of
pleasure
he
was
fully
convinced
of
his
right
to
rest
to
enjoy
long
and
comfortable
travels
and
so
forth
because
in
the
first
place
he
was
rich
and
in
the
second
place
notwithstanding
his
years
he
was
just
starting
to
live
up
to
the
present
he
had
not
lived
but
only
existed
quite
well
it
is
true
yet
with
all
his
hopes
on
the
future
he
had
worked
incessantly
and
the
chinamen
whom
he
employed
by
the
thousand
in
his
factories
knew
what
that
meant
now
at
last
he
realized
that
a
great
deal
had
been
accomplished
and
that
he
had
almost
reached
the
level
of
those
whom
he
had
taken
as
his
ideals
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
pause
for
a
breathing
space
men
of
his
class
usually
began
their
enjoyments
with
a
trip
to
europe
india
egypt
he
decided
to
do
the
same
he
wished
naturally
to
reward
himself
in
the
first
place
for
all
his
years
of
toil
but
he
was
quite
glad
that
his
wife
and
daughter
should
also
share
in
his
pleasures
true
his
wife
was
not
distinguished
by
any
marked
susceptibilities
but
then
elderly
american
women
are
all
passionate
travellers
as
for
his
daughter
a
girl
no
longer
young
and
somewhat
delicate
travel
was
really
necessary
for
her
apart
from
the
question
of
health
do
not
happy
meetings
often
take
place
in
the
course
of
travel
one
may
find
one
self
sitting
next
to
a
multimillionaire
at
table
or
examining
frescoes
side
by
side
with
him
the
itinerary
planned
by
the
gentleman
of
san
francisco
was
extensive
in
december
and
january
he
hoped
to
enjoy
the
sun
of
southern
italy
the
monuments
of
antiquity
the
tarantella
the
serenades
of
vagrant
minstrels
and
finally
that
which
men
of
his
age
are
most
susceptible
to
the
love
of
quite
young
neapolitan
girls
even
when
the
love
is
not
altogether
disinterestedly
given
carnival
he
thought
of
spending
in
nice
in
monte
carlo
where
at
that
season
gathers
the
most
select
society
the
precise
society
on
which
depend
all
the
blessings
of
civilization
the
fashion
in
evening
dress
the
stability
of
thrones
the
declaration
of
wars
the
prosperity
of
hotels
where
some
devote
themselves
passionately
to
automobile
and
boat
races
others
to
roulette
others
to
what
is
called
flirtation
and
others
to
the
shooting
of
pigeons
which
beautifully
soar
from
their
traps
over
emerald
lawns
against
a
background
of
sea
instantly
to
fall
hitting
the
ground
in
little
white
heaps
the
beginning
of
march
he
wished
to
devote
to
florence
passion
week
in
rome
to
hear
the
music
of
the
miserere
his
plans
also
included
venice
paris
in
seville
bathing
in
the
british
isles
then
athens
constantinople
egypt
even
japan
certainly
on
his
way
home
and
everything
at
the
outset
went
splendidly
it
was
the
end
of
november
practically
all
the
way
to
gibraltar
the
voyage
passed
in
icy
darkness
varied
by
storms
of
wet
snow
yet
the
ship
travelled
well
even
without
much
rolling
the
passengers
on
board
were
many
and
all
people
of
some
importance
the
boat
the
famous
resembled
a
most
expensive
european
hotel
with
all
modern
equipments
a
night
refreshment
bar
turkish
baths
a
newspaper
printed
on
board
so
that
the
days
aboard
the
liner
passed
in
the
most
select
manner
the
passengers
rose
early
to
the
sound
of
bugles
sounding
shrilly
through
the
corridors
in
that
grey
twilit
hour
when
day
was
breaking
slowly
and
sullenly
over
the
watery
desert
which
rolled
heavily
in
the
fog
clad
in
their
flannel
pyjamas
the
gentlemen
took
coffee
chocolate
or
cocoa
then
seated
themselves
in
marble
baths
did
exercises
thereby
whetting
their
appetite
and
their
sense
of
made
their
toilet
for
the
day
and
proceeded
to
breakfast
till
eleven
they
were
supposed
to
stroll
cheerfully
on
deck
breathing
the
cold
freshness
of
the
ocean
or
they
played
or
other
games
that
they
might
have
an
appetite
for
their
eleven
refreshment
of
sandwiches
and
bouillon
after
which
they
read
their
newspaper
with
pleasure
and
calmly
awaited
luncheon
which
was
a
still
more
varied
and
nourishing
meal
than
breakfast
the
two
hours
which
followed
luncheon
were
devoted
to
rest
all
the
decks
were
crowded
with
lounge
chairs
on
which
lay
passengers
wrapped
in
plaids
looking
at
the
sky
or
the
foamy
hillocks
which
flashed
behind
the
bows
and
dozing
sweetly
till
five
when
refreshed
and
lively
they
were
treated
to
strong
fragrant
tea
and
sweet
cakes
at
seven
announced
a
dinner
of
nine
courses
and
now
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
rising
flush
of
vital
forces
hastened
to
his
state
cabin
to
dress
in
the
evening
the
tiers
of
the
yawned
in
the
darkness
as
with
innumerable
fiery
eyes
and
a
multitude
of
servants
in
the
kitchens
sculleries
worked
with
a
special
frenzy
the
ocean
heaving
beyond
was
terrible
but
no
one
thought
of
it
firmly
believing
in
the
captain
power
over
it
the
captain
was
a
man
of
monstrous
size
and
weight
apparently
always
torpid
who
looked
in
his
uniform
with
broad
gold
stripes
very
like
a
huge
idol
and
who
rarely
emerged
from
his
mysterious
chambers
to
show
himself
to
the
passengers
every
minute
the
siren
howled
from
the
bows
with
hellish
moroseness
and
screamed
with
fury
but
few
diners
heard
it
it
was
drowned
by
the
sounds
of
an
excellent
string
band
exquisitely
and
untiringly
playing
in
the
huge
hall
that
was
decorated
with
marble
and
covered
with
velvet
carpets
flooded
with
feasts
of
light
from
crystal
chandeliers
and
gilded
girandoles
and
crowded
with
ladies
in
bare
shoulders
and
jewels
with
men
in
elegant
waiters
and
respectful
one
of
whom
he
who
took
the
only
wore
a
chain
round
his
neck
like
a
lord
mayor
and
perfect
linen
made
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
look
much
younger
dry
of
small
stature
badly
built
but
strongly
made
polished
to
a
glow
and
in
due
measure
animated
he
sat
in
the
radiance
of
this
palace
with
a
bottle
of
amber
johannisberg
at
his
hand
and
glasses
large
and
small
of
delicate
crystal
and
a
curly
bunch
of
fresh
hyacinths
there
was
something
mongolian
in
his
yellowish
face
with
its
trimmed
silvery
moustache
large
teeth
blazing
with
gold
and
strong
bald
head
blazing
like
old
ivory
richly
dressed
but
in
keeping
with
her
age
sat
his
wife
a
big
broad
quiet
woman
intricately
but
lightly
and
transparently
dressed
with
an
innocent
immodesty
sat
his
daughter
tall
slim
her
magnificent
hair
splendidly
done
her
breath
fragrant
with
violet
cachous
and
the
tenderest
little
rosy
moles
showing
near
her
lip
and
between
her
bare
slightly
powdered
shoulder
blades
the
dinner
lasted
two
whole
hours
to
be
followed
by
dancing
in
the
whence
the
men
including
of
course
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
proceeded
to
the
bar
there
with
their
feet
cocked
up
on
the
tables
they
settled
the
destinies
of
nations
in
the
course
of
their
political
and
conversations
smoking
meanwhile
havana
cigars
and
drinking
liqueurs
till
they
were
crimson
in
the
face
waited
on
all
the
while
by
negroes
in
red
jackets
with
eyes
like
peeled
eggs
outside
the
ocean
heaved
in
black
mountains
the
hissed
furiously
in
the
clogged
cordage
the
steamer
trembled
in
every
fibre
as
she
surmounted
these
watery
hills
and
struggled
with
the
storm
ploughing
through
the
moving
masses
which
every
now
and
then
reared
in
front
of
her
the
siren
choked
by
the
fog
groaned
in
mortal
anguish
the
watchmen
in
the
towers
froze
with
cold
and
went
mad
with
their
straining
of
attention
as
the
gloomy
and
sultry
depths
of
the
inferno
as
the
ninth
circle
was
the
submerged
womb
of
the
steamer
where
gigantic
furnaces
roared
and
dully
giggled
devouring
with
their
maws
mountains
of
coal
cast
hoarsely
in
by
men
naked
to
the
waist
bathed
in
their
own
corrosive
dirty
sweat
and
lurid
with
the
reflection
of
flame
but
in
the
refreshment
bar
men
jauntily
put
their
feet
up
on
the
tables
showing
their
pumps
and
sipped
cognac
or
other
liqueurs
and
swam
in
waves
of
fragrant
smoke
as
they
chatted
in
manner
in
the
dancing
hall
light
and
warmth
and
joy
were
poured
over
everything
couples
turned
in
the
waltz
or
writhed
in
the
tango
while
the
music
insistently
shamelessly
delightfully
with
sadness
entreated
for
one
only
one
thing
one
and
the
same
thing
all
the
time
amongst
this
resplendent
crowd
was
an
ambassador
a
little
dry
modest
old
man
a
great
millionaire
tall
of
an
indefinite
age
looking
like
a
prelate
in
his
also
a
famous
spanish
author
and
an
international
beauty
already
the
least
bit
faded
of
unenviable
reputation
finally
an
exquisite
loving
couple
whom
everybody
watched
curiously
because
of
their
unconcealed
happiness
danced
only
with
and
sang
with
great
skill
only
to
accompaniment
and
everything
about
them
seemed
so
charming
and
only
the
captain
knew
that
this
couple
had
been
engaged
by
the
steamship
company
to
play
at
love
for
a
good
salary
and
that
they
had
been
sailing
for
a
long
time
now
on
one
liner
now
on
another
at
gibraltar
the
sun
gladdened
them
all
it
was
like
early
spring
a
new
passenger
appeared
on
board
arousing
general
interest
he
was
a
hereditary
prince
of
a
certain
asiatic
state
travelling
incognito
a
small
man
as
if
all
made
of
wood
though
his
movements
were
alert
in
glasses
a
little
unpleasant
because
of
his
large
black
moustache
which
was
sparse
and
transparent
like
that
of
a
corpse
but
on
the
whole
inoffensive
simple
modest
in
the
mediterranean
they
met
once
more
the
breath
of
winter
waves
large
and
florid
as
the
tail
of
a
peacock
waves
with
crests
heaved
under
the
impulse
of
the
tramontane
wind
and
came
merrily
madly
rushing
towards
the
ship
in
the
bright
lustre
of
a
perfectly
clear
sky
the
next
day
the
sky
began
to
pale
the
horizon
grew
dim
land
was
approaching
ischia
capri
could
be
seen
through
the
glasses
then
naples
herself
looking
like
pieces
of
sugar
strewn
at
the
foot
of
some
mass
whilst
beyond
vague
and
deadly
white
with
snow
a
range
of
distant
mountains
the
decks
were
crowded
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
putting
on
light
coats
noiseless
chinese
servant
boys
with
plaits
hanging
down
to
their
heels
and
with
girlish
thick
eyebrows
unobtrusively
came
and
went
carrying
up
the
stairways
plaids
canes
valises
of
crocodile
leather
and
never
speaking
above
a
whisper
the
daughter
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
stood
side
by
side
with
the
prince
who
by
a
happy
circumstance
had
been
introduced
to
her
the
previous
evening
she
had
the
air
of
one
looking
fixedly
into
the
distance
towards
something
which
he
was
pointing
out
to
her
and
which
he
was
explaining
hurriedly
in
a
low
voice
owing
to
his
size
he
looked
amongst
the
rest
like
a
boy
altogether
he
was
not
handsome
rather
queer
with
his
spectacles
bowler
hat
and
english
coat
and
then
the
hair
of
his
sparse
moustache
just
like
and
the
swarthy
thin
skin
of
his
face
seeming
stretched
over
his
features
and
slightly
varnished
but
the
girl
listened
to
him
and
was
so
excited
that
she
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
her
heart
beat
with
incomprehensible
rapture
because
of
him
because
he
was
standing
next
to
her
and
talking
to
her
to
her
alone
everything
everything
about
him
was
so
unusual
his
dry
hands
his
clean
skin
under
which
flowed
ancient
royal
blood
even
his
plain
but
somehow
particularly
tidy
european
dress
everything
was
invested
with
an
indefinable
glamour
with
all
that
was
calculated
to
enthrall
a
young
woman
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
wearing
for
his
part
a
silk
hat
and
grey
spats
over
shoes
kept
eyeing
the
famous
beauty
who
stood
near
him
a
tall
wonderful
figure
blonde
with
her
eyes
painted
according
to
the
latest
parisian
fashion
holding
on
a
silver
chain
a
tiny
cringing
hairless
little
dog
to
which
she
was
addressing
herself
all
the
time
and
the
daughter
feeling
some
vague
embarrassment
tried
not
to
notice
her
father
like
all
americans
he
was
very
liberal
with
his
money
when
travelling
and
like
all
of
them
he
believed
in
the
full
sincerity
and
of
those
who
brought
his
food
and
drinks
served
him
from
morn
till
night
anticipated
his
smallest
desire
watched
over
his
cleanliness
and
rest
carried
his
things
called
the
porters
conveyed
his
trunks
to
the
hotels
so
it
was
everywhere
so
it
was
during
the
voyage
so
it
ought
to
be
in
naples
naples
grew
and
drew
nearer
the
brass
band
shining
with
the
brass
of
their
instruments
had
already
assembled
on
deck
suddenly
they
deafened
everybody
with
the
strains
of
their
triumphant
the
giant
captain
appeared
in
full
uniform
on
the
bridge
and
like
a
benign
pagan
idol
waved
his
hands
to
the
passengers
in
a
gesture
of
welcome
and
to
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
as
well
as
to
every
other
passenger
it
seemed
as
if
for
him
alone
was
thundered
forth
that
march
so
greatly
beloved
by
proud
america
for
him
alone
the
captain
hand
waved
welcoming
him
on
his
safe
arrival
then
when
at
last
the
entered
port
and
veered
her
mass
against
the
quay
that
was
crowded
with
expectant
people
when
the
gangways
began
their
rattling
ah
then
what
a
lot
of
porters
and
their
assistants
in
caps
with
golden
galloons
what
a
lot
of
all
sorts
of
commissionaires
whistling
boys
and
sturdy
ragamuffins
with
packs
of
postcards
in
their
hands
rushed
to
meet
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
with
offers
of
their
services
with
what
amiable
contempt
he
grinned
at
those
ragamuffins
as
he
walked
to
the
automobile
of
the
very
same
hotel
at
which
the
prince
would
probably
put
up
and
calmly
muttered
between
his
teeth
now
in
english
now
in
italian
go
away
via
life
at
naples
started
immediately
in
the
set
routine
early
in
the
morning
breakfast
in
a
gloomy
with
a
draughty
damp
wind
blowing
in
from
the
windows
that
opened
on
to
a
little
stony
garden
a
cloudy
unpromising
day
and
a
crowd
of
guides
at
the
doors
of
the
vestibule
then
the
first
smiles
of
a
warm
sun
and
from
the
high
overhanging
balcony
a
view
of
vesuvius
bathed
to
the
feet
in
the
radiant
vapours
of
the
morning
sky
while
beyond
over
the
ripple
of
the
bay
the
subtle
outline
of
capri
upon
the
horizon
then
nearer
tiny
donkeys
running
in
buggies
away
below
on
the
sticky
embankment
and
detachments
of
tiny
soldiers
marching
off
with
cheerful
and
defiant
music
after
this
a
walk
to
the
and
a
slow
drive
along
crowded
narrow
damp
corridors
of
streets
between
high
houses
visits
to
museums
smoothly
and
pleasantly
lighted
but
monotonously
as
if
from
the
reflection
of
snow
or
visits
to
churches
cold
smelling
of
wax
and
always
the
same
thing
a
majestic
portal
curtained
with
a
heavy
leather
curtain
inside
a
huge
emptiness
silence
lonely
little
flames
of
clustered
candles
ruddying
the
depths
of
the
interior
on
some
altar
decorated
with
ribbon
a
forlorn

luncheon
at
one
on
san
martino
where
quite
a
number
of
the
very
selectest
people
gather
about
midday
and
where
once
the
daughter
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
almost
became
ill
with
joy
fancying
she
saw
the
prince
sitting
in
the
hall
although
she
knew
from
the
newspapers
that
he
had
gone
to
rome
for
a
time
at
five
tea
in
the
hotel
in
the
smart
salon
where
it
was
so
warm
with
the
deep
carpets
and
blazing
fires
after
which
the
thought
of
dinner
and
again
the
powerful
commanding
voice
of
the
gong
heard
over
all
the
floors
and
again
strings
of
ladies
rustling
with
their
silks
on
the
staircases
and
reflecting
themselves
in
the
mirrors
again
the
hospitable
palatial
the
red
jackets
of
musicians
on
the
platform
the
black
flock
of
waiters
around
the
who
with
extraordinary
skill
was
pouring
out
a
thick
roseate
soup
into
the
dinners
as
usual
were
the
crowning
event
of
the
day
every
one
dressed
as
if
for
a
wedding
and
so
abundant
were
the
dishes
the
wines
the
sweetmeats
and
fruit
that
at
about
eleven
in
the

the

to
warm
the

of
those
who
had
dined
none
the
less
december
of
that
year
was
not
a
success
for
naples
the
porters
and
secretaries
were
abashed
if
spoken
to
about
the
weather
only
guiltily
lifting
their
shoulders
and
murmuring
that
they
could
not
possibly
remember
such
a
season
although
this
was
not
the
first
year
they
had
had
to
make
such
murmurs
or
to
hint
that
everywhere
something
terrible
is
happening
unprecedented

and

on

and

fleeing
from
the

of

the
morning
sun
daily
deceived
the
neapolitans
the
sky
invariably
grew
grey
towards
midday
and
fine
rain
began
to
fall
falling
thicker
and
colder
the
palms
of
the
hotel
approach
glistened
like
wet
tin
the
city
seemed
peculiarly
dirty
and
narrow
the
museums
excessively
dull
the
of
the
fat
whose
rubber
flapped
like
wings
in
the
wind
seemed
insufferably
stinking
the
energetic
cracking
of
whips
over
the
ears
of
horses
sounded
altogether
false
and
the
clack
of
the
shoes
of
the
signorini
who
cleaned
the
quite
horrible
while
the
women
walking
through
the
mud
with
their
black
heads
uncovered
in
the
rain
seemed
disgustingly
not
to
mention
the
stench
and
dampness
of
foul
fish
which
drifted
from
the
quay
where
the
sea
was
foaming
the
gentleman
and
lady
from
san
francisco
began
to
bicker
in
the
mornings
their
daughter
went
about
pale
and
and
then
roused
up
again
went
into
raptures
over
everything
and
was
lovely
charming
charming
were
those
tender
complicated
feelings
which
had
been
aroused
in
her
by
the
meeting
with
the
plain
little
man
in
whose
veins
ran
such
special
blood
but
after
all
does
it
matter
awakens
a
maiden
soul
whether
it
is
money
fame
or
noble
birth
everybody
declared
that
in
sorrento
or
in
capri
it
was
quite
different
there
it
was
warmer
sunnier
the
were
in
bloom
the
morals
were
purer
the
wine
unadulterated
so
behold
the
family
from
san
francisco
decided
to
go
with
all
their
trunks
to
capri
after
which
they
would
return
and
settle
down
in
sorrento
when
they
had
seen
capri
trodden
the
stones
where
stood
tiberius
palaces
visited
the
famous
caves
of
the
blue
grotto
and
listened
to
the
pipers
from
abruzzi
who
wander
about
the
isle
during
the
month
of
the
nativity
singing
the
praises
of
the
virgin
on
the
day
of
departure
a
very
memorable
day
for
the
family
from
san
francisco
the
sun
did
not
come
out
even
in
the
morning
a
heavy
fog
hid
vesuvius
to
the
base
and
came
greying
low
over
the
leaden
heave
of
the
sea
whose
waters
were
concealed
from
the
eye
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
capri
was
completely
invisible
as
if
it
had
never
existed
on
earth
the
little
steamer
that
was
making
for
the
island
tossed
so
violently
from
side
to
side
that
the
family
from
san
francisco
lay
like
stones
on
the
sofas
in
the
miserable
saloon
of
the
tiny
boat
their
feet
wrapped
in
plaids
and
their
eyes
closed
the
lady
as
she
thought
suffered
worst
of
all
and
several
times
was
overcome
with
sickness
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
dying
but
the
stewardess
who
came
to
and
fro
with
the
basin
the
stewardess
who
had
been
for
years
day
in
day
out
through
heat
and
cold
tossing
on
these
waves
and
who
was
still
indefatigable
even
kind
to
every
one
she
only
smiled
the
younger
lady
from
san
francisco
was
deathly
pale
and
held
in
her
teeth
a
slice
of
lemon
now
not
even
the
thought
of
meeting
the
prince
at
sorrento
where
he
was
due
to
arrive
by
christmas
could
gladden
her
the
gentleman
lay
flat
on
his
back
in
a
broad
overcoat
and
a
flat
cap
and
did
not
loosen
his
jaws
throughout
the
voyage
his
face
grew
dark
his
moustache
white
his
head
ached
furiously
for
the
last
few
days
owing
to
the
bad
weather
he
had
been
drinking
heavily
and
had
more
than
once
admired
the
tableaux
vivants
the
rain
whipped
on
the
rattling
under
which
water
dripped
on
to
the
sofas
the
wind
beat
the
masts
with
a
howl
and
at
moments
aided
by
an
onrushing
wave
laid
the
little
steamer
right
on
its
side
whereupon
something
would
roll
noisily
away
below
at
the
stopping
places
castellamare
sorrento
things
were
a
little
better
but
even
the
ship
heaved
frightfully
and
the
coast
with
all
its
precipices
gardens
pines
pink
and
white
hotels
and
hazy
curly
green
mountains
swooped
past
the
window
up
and
down
as
it
were
on
swings
the
boats
bumped
against
the
side
of
the
ship
the
sailors
and
passengers
shouted
lustily
and
somewhere
a
child
as
if
crushed
to
death
choked
itself
with
screaming
the
damp
wind
blew
through
the
doors
and
outside
on
the
sea
from
a
reeling
boat
which
showed
the
flag
of
the
hotel
royal
a
fellow
with
guttural
french
exaggeration
yelled
unceasingly
hotel
intending
to
lure
passengers
aboard
his
craft
then
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
feeling
as
he
ought
to
have
felt
quite
an
old
man
thought
with
anguish
and
spite
of
all
these
royals
splendids
excelsiors
and
of
these
greedy
fellows
called
italians
once
during
a
halt
on
opening
his
eyes
and
rising
from
the
sofa
he
saw
under
the
rocky
of
the
coast
a
heap
of
such
miserable
stone
hovels
all
musty
and
mouldy
stuck
on
top
of
one
another
by
the
very
water
among
the
boats
and
the
rags
of
all
sorts
tin
cans
and
brown
and
remembering
that
this
was
the
very
italy
he
had
come
to
enjoy
he
was
seized
with
despair
at
last
in
the
twilight
the
black
mass
of
the
island
began
to
loom
nearer
looking
as
if
it
were
bored
through
at
the
base
with
little
red
lights
the
wind
grew
softer
warmer
more
over
the
tamed
waves
undulating
like
black
oil
there
came
flowing
golden
of
light
from
the
lanterns
of
the
harbour
then
suddenly
the
anchor
rumbled
and
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
water
furious
cries
of
the
boatmen
shouting
against
one
another
came
from
all
directions
and
relief
was
felt
at
once
the
electric
light
of
the
cabin
shone
brighter
and
a
desire
to
eat
drink
smoke
move
once
more
made
itself
felt
ten
minutes
later
the
family
from
san
francisco
disembarked
into
a
large
boat
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
had
stepped
on
to
the
stones
of
the
quay
and
were
soon
seated
in
the
bright
little
car
of
the
funicular
railway
with
a
buzz
they
were
ascending
the
slope
past
the
stakes
of
the
vineyards
and
wet
sturdy
here
and
there
protected
by
straw
screens
past
the
thick
glossy
foliage
and
the
brilliancy
of
orange
fruits
sweetly
smells
the
earth
in
italy
after
rain
and
each
of
her
islands
has
its
own
peculiar
aroma
the
island
of
capri
was
damp
and
dark
that
evening
for
the
moment
however
it
had
revived
and
was
lighted
up
here
and
there
as
usual
at
the
hour
of
the
steamer
arrival
at
the
top
of
the
ascent
on
the
little
piazza
by
the
funicular
station
stood
the
crowd
of
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
with
propriety
the
luggage
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
there
were
other
arrivals
too
but
none
worthy
of
notice
a
few
russians
who
had
settled
in
capri
untidy
and
owing
to
their
bookish
thoughts
spectacled
bearded
in
the
upturned
collars
of
their
thick
woollen
overcoats
then
a
group
of
german
youths
in
tirolese
costumes
with
knapsacks
over
their
shoulders
needing
no
assistance
feeling
everywhere
at
home
and
always
economical
in
tips
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
who
kept
quietly
apart
from
both
groups
was
marked
out
at
once
he
and
his
ladies
were
hastily
assisted
from
the
car
men
ran
in
front
to
show
them
the
way
and
they
set
off
on
foot
surrounded
by
urchins
and
by
the
sturdy
capri
women
who
carry
on
their
heads
the
luggage
of
decent
travellers
across
the
piazza
that
looked
like
an
opera
scene
in
the
light
of
the
electric
globe
that
swung
aloft
in
the
damp
wind
clacked
the
wooden
pattens
of
the
the
gang
of
urchins
began
to
whistle
to
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
and
to
turn
somersaults
around
him
whilst
he
as
if
on
the
stage
marched
among
them
towards
a
mediæval
archway
and
under
huddled
houses
behind
which
led
a
little
echoing
lane
past
tufts
of
showing
above
the
flat
roofs
to
the
left
and
under
the
stars
in
the
dark
blue
sky
upwards
towards
the
shining
entrance
of
the
hotel
and
again
it
seemed
as
if
purely
in
honour
of
the
guests
from
san
francisco
the
damp
little
town
on
the
rocky
little
island
of
the
mediterranean
had
revived
from
its
evening
stupor
that
their
arrival
alone
had
made
the
hotel
proprietor
so
happy
and
hearty
and
that
for
them
had
been
waiting
the
chinese
gong
which
sent
its
howlings
through
all
the
house
the
moment
they
crossed
the
doorstep
the
sight
of
the
proprietor
a
superbly
elegant
young
man
with
a
polite
and
exquisite
bow
startled
for
a
moment
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
in
the
first
flash
he
remembered
that
amid
the
chaos
of
images
which
had
possessed
him
the
previous
night
in
his
sleep
he
had
seen
that
very
man
to
a
the
same
man
in
the
same
and
with
the
same
glossy
perfectly
smoothed
hair
startled
he
hesitated
for
a
second
but
long
long
ago
he
had
lost
the
last
of
any
mystical
feeling
he
might
ever
have
had
and
his
surprise
at
once
faded
he
told
the
curious
coincidence
of
dream
and
reality
jestingly
to
his
wife
and
daughter
as
they
passed
along
the
hotel
corridor
and
only
his
daughter
glanced
at
him
with
a
little
alarm
her
heart
suddenly
contracted
with
with
such
a
violent
feeling
of
loneliness
in
this
dark
foreign
island
that
she
nearly
wept
as
usual
however
she
did
not
mention
her
feelings
to
her
father
reuss
a
high
personage
who
had
spent
three
whole
weeks
on
capri
had
just
left
and
the
visitors
were
installed
in
the
suite
of
rooms
that
he
had
occupied
to
them
was
assigned
the
most
beautiful
and
expert
chambermaid
a
belgian
with
a
thin
firmly
corseted
figure
and
a
starched
cap
in
the
shape
of
a
tiny
indented
crown
the
most
experienced
and
footman
was
placed
at
their
service
a
sicilian
and
also
the
smartest
waiter
the
small
stout
luigi
a
tremendous
buffoon
who
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
in
a
minute
or
two
a
gentle
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
and
there
stood
the
a
frenchman
who
had
come
to
ask
if
the
guests
would
take
dinner
and
to
report
in
case
of
answer
in
the
affirmative
of
which
however
he
had
small
doubt
that
this
evening
there
were
mediterranean
lobsters
roast
beef
asparagus
pheasants
etc
the
floor
was
still
rocking
under
the
feet
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
so
rolled
about
had
he
been
on
that
wretched
grubby
italian
steamer
yet
with
his
own
hands
calmly
though
clumsily
from
lack
of
experience
he
closed
the
window
which
had
banged
at
the
entrance
of
the
shutting
out
the
drifting
smell
of
distant
kitchens
and
of
wet
flowers
in
the
garden
then
he
turned
and
replied
with
unhurried
distinctness
that
they
would
take
dinner
that
their
table
must
be
far
from
the
door
in
the
very
centre
of
the
that
they
would
have
local
wine
and
champagne
moderately
dry
and
slightly
cooled
to
all
of
which
the
gave
assent
in
the
most
varied
intonations
which
conveyed
that
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
the
faintest
question
of
the
justness
of
the
desires
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
and
that
everything
should
be
exactly
as
he
wished
at
the
end
he
inclined
his
head
and
politely
inquired
is
that
all
sir
on
receiving
a
lingering
yes
he
added
that
carmela
and
giuseppe
famous
all
over
italy
and
to
all
the
world
of
tourists
were
going
to
dance
the
tarantella
that
evening
in
the
hall
i
have
seen
of
her
said
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
in
a
voice
expressive
of
nothing
and
is
giuseppe
her
husband
her
cousin
sir
replied
the
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
was
silent
for
a
while
thinking
of
something
but
saying
nothing
then
he
dismissed
the
man
with
a
nod
of
the
head
after
which
he
began
to
make
preparations
as
if
for
his
wedding
he
turned
on
all
the
electric
lights
and
filled
the
mirrors
with
brilliance
and
reflection
of
furniture
and
open
trunks
he
began
to
shave
and
wash
ringing
the
bell
every
minute
and
down
the
corridor
raced
and
crossed
the
impatient
ringings
from
the
rooms
of
his
wife
and
daughter
luigi
with
the
nimbleness
peculiar
to
certain
stout
people
making
grimaces
of
horror
which
brought
tears
of
laughter
to
the
eyes
of
chambermaids
dashing
past
with
pails
turned
a
to
the
gentleman
door
and
tapping
with
his
knuckles
in
a
voice
of
sham
timidity
and
respectfulness
reduced
to
idiocy
asked
ha
suonato
signore
from
behind
the
door
a
slow
grating
offensively
polite
voice
yes
come
in
what
were
the
feelings
what
were
the
thoughts
of
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
on
that
evening
so
significant
to
him
he
felt
nothing
exceptional
since
unfortunately
everything
on
this
earth
is
too
simple
in
appearance
even
had
he
felt
something
imminent
in
his
soul
all
the
same
he
would
have
reasoned
that
whatever
it
might
be
it
could
not
take
place
immediately
besides
as
with
all
who
have
just
experienced
he
was
very
hungry
and
looked
forward
with
delight
to
the
first
spoonful
of
soup
the
first
mouthful
of
wine
so
he
performed
the
customary
business
of
dressing
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
left
no
room
for
reflection
having
shaved
washed
and
dexterously
arranged
several
artificial
teeth
standing
in
front
of
the
mirror
he
moistened
his
brushes
and
plastered
the
remains
of
his
thick
pearly
hair
on
his
swarthy
yellow
skull
he
drew
on
to
his
strong
old
body
with
its
abdomen
protuberant
from
excessive
good
living
his
silk
underwear
put
black
silk
socks
and
slippers
on
his
feet
he
put
in
the
shining
cuffs
of
his
shirt
and
bending
forward
so
that
his
shirt
front
bulged
out
he
arranged
his
trousers
that
were
pulled
up
high
by
his
silk
braces
and
began
to
torture
himself
putting
his
through
the
stiff
collar
the
floor
was
still
rocking
beneath
him
the
tips
of
his
fingers
hurt
the
stud
at
moments
pinched
the
flabby
skin
in
the
recess
under
his
adam
apple
but
he
persisted
and
at
last
with
eyes
all
strained
and
face
from
the
collar
that
enclosed
his
throat
he
finished
the
business
and
sat
down
exhausted
in
front
of
the
pier
glass
which
reflected
the
whole
of
him
and
repeated
him
in
all
the
other
mirrors
it
is
awful
he
muttered
dropping
his
strong
bald
head
but
without
trying
to
understand
or
to
know
what
was
awful
then
with
habitual
careful
attention
examining
his
short
fingers
and
large
convex
he
repeated
it
is
awful
as
if
from
a
pagan
temple
shrilly
resounded
the
second
gong
through
the
hotel
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
got
up
hastily
pulled
his
still
tighter
with
his
tie
and
his
abdomen
tighter
with
his
open
waistcoat
settled
his
cuffs
and
again
examined
himself
in
the
mirror
that
carmela
swarthy
with
her
enticing
eyes
looking
like
a
mulatto
in
her
dress
chiefly
orange
she
must
be
an
extraordinary
dancer
he
was
thinking
so
cheerfully
leaving
his
room
and
walking
on
the
carpet
to
his
wife
room
he
called
to
ask
if
they
were
nearly
ready
in
five
minutes
dad
came
the
gay
voice
of
the
girl
from
behind
the
door
i
arranging
my
hair
said
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
imagining
to
himself
her
long
hair
hanging
to
the
floor
he
slowly
walked
along
the
corridors
and
staircases
covered
with
red
carpet
downstairs
looking
for
the
the
servants
he
encountered
on
the
way
pressed
close
to
the
wall
and
he
walked
past
as
if
not
noticing
them
an
old
lady
late
for
dinner
already
stooping
with
age
with
hair
and
yet
in
her
pale
grey
silk
dress
hurried
at
top
speed
funnily
henlike
and
he
easily
overtook
her
by
the
of
the
wherein
the
guests
had
already
started
the
meal
he
stopped
before
a
little
table
heaped
with
boxes
of
cigars
and
cigarettes
and
taking
a
large
manilla
threw
three
liras
on
the
table
after
which
he
passed
along
the
winter
terrace
and
glanced
through
an
open
window
from
the
darkness
came
a
waft
of
soft
air
and
there
loomed
the
top
of
an
old
that
spread
its
boughs
over
the
stars
looking
like
a
giant
bringing
down
the
smooth
quivering
of
the
sea
in
the
cosy
with
the
shaded
a
grey
untidy
german
looking
rather
like
ibsen
in
his
round
spectacles
and
with
mad
astonished
eyes
stood
rustling
the
newspapers
after
coldly
eyeing
him
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
seated
himself
in
a
deep
leather
armchair
in
a
corner
by
a
lamp
with
a
green
shade
put
on
his
and
with
a
stretch
of
his
neck
because
of
the
tightness
of
his
obliterated
himself
behind
a
newspaper
he
glanced
over
the
headlines
read
a
few
sentences
about
the
balkan
war
then
with
a
habitual
movement
turned
over
the
page
of
the
newspaper
when
suddenly
the
lines
blazed
up
before
him
in
a
glassy
sheen
his
neck
swelled
his
eyes
bulged
and
the
came
flying
off
his
nose
he
lunged
forward
wanted
to
breathe
and
rattled
wildly
his
lower
jaw
dropped
and
his
mouth
shone
with
gold
fillings
his
head
fell
swaying
on
his
shoulder
his
bulged
out
and
all
his
body
writhing
with
heels
scraping
up
the
carpet
slid
down
to
the
floor
struggling
desperately
with
some
invisible
foe
if
the
german
had
not
been
in
the
the
frightful
affair
could
have
been
hushed
up
instantly
through
obscure
passages
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
could
have
been
hurried
away
to
some
dark
corner
and
not
a
single
guest
would
have
discovered
what
he
had
been
up
to
but
the
german
dashed
out
of
the
room
with
a
yell
alarming
the
house
and
all
the
diners
many
sprang
up
from
the
table
upsetting
their
chairs
many
pallid
ran
towards
the
and
in
every
language
it
was
asked
what
what
the
matter
none
answered
intelligibly
nobody
understood
for
even
people
are
more
surprised
at
death
than
at
anything
else
and
never
want
to
believe
it
is
true
the
proprietor
rushed
from
one
guest
to
another
trying
to
keep
back
those
who
were
hastening
up
to
soothe
them
with
assurances
that
it
was
a
mere
trifle
a
that
had
overcome
a
certain
gentleman
from
san
francisco
but
no
one
heeded
him
many
saw
how
the
porters
and
waiters
were
tearing
off
the
tie
waistcoat
and
crumpled
from
that
same
gentleman
even
for
some
reason
or
other
pulling
off
his
patent
from
his
feet
and
he
was
still
writhing
he
continued
to
struggle
with
death
by
no
means
wanting
to
yield
to
that
which
had
so
unexpectedly
and
rudely
overtaken
him
he
rolled
his
head
rattled
like
one
throttled
and
turned
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
drunk
when
he
had
been
hastily
carried
into
room
no
the
smallest
wretchedest
dampest
and
coldest
room
at
the
end
of
the
bottom
corridor
his
daughter
came
running
with
her
hair
all
loose
her
flying
open
showing
her
bosom
raised
by
her
corsets
then
his
wife
large
and
heavy
and
completely
dressed
for
dinner
her
mouth
opened
round
with
terror
but
by
that
time
he
had
already
ceased
rolling
his
head
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
hotel
settled
down
somehow
or
other
but
the
evening
was
ruined
the
guests
returning
to
the
finished
their
dinner
in
silence
with
a
look
of
injury
on
their
faces
whilst
the
proprietor
went
from
one
to
another
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
hopeless
and
natural
irritation
feeling
himself
guilty
through
no
fault
of
his
own
assuring
everybody
that
he
perfectly
realized
how
disagreeable
this
is
and
giving
his
word
that
he
would
take
every
possible
measure
within
his
power
to
remove
the
trouble
the
tarantella
had
to
be
cancelled
the
superfluous
lights
were
switched
off
most
of
the
guests
went
to
the
bar
and
soon
the
house
became
so
quiet
that
the
ticking
of
the
clock
was
heard
distinctly
in
the
hall
where
the
lonely
parrot
woodenly
muttered
something
as
he
bustled
about
in
his
cage
preparatory
to
going
to
sleep
and
managed
to
fall
asleep
at
length
with
his
paw
absurdly
suspended
from
the
little
upper
perch
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
lay
on
a
cheap
iron
bed
under
coarse
blankets
on
to
which
fell
a
dim
light
from
the
obscure
electric
lamp
in
the
ceiling
an
slid
down
on
his
wet
cold
forehead
his
blue
already
lifeless
face
grew
gradually
cold
the
hoarse
bubbling
which
came
from
his
open
mouth
where
the
gleam
of
gold
still
showed
grew
weak
the
gentleman
from
san
francisco
rattled
no
longer
he
was
no
more
something
else
lay
in
his
place
his
wife
his
daughter
the
doctor
and
the
servants
stood
and
watched
him
dully
suddenly
that
which
they
feared
and
expected
happened
the
rattling
ceased
and
slowly
slowly
under
their
eyes
a
pallor
spread
over
the
face
of
the
deceased
his
features
began
to
grow
thinner
more
transparent
with
a
beauty
which
might
have
suited
him
long
ago
entered
the
proprietor
gia
e
morto
whispered
the
doctor
to
him
the
proprietor
raised
his
shoulders
as
if
it
were
not
his
affair
the
wife
on
whose
cheeks
tears
were
slowly
trickling
approached
and
timidly
asked
that
the
deceased
should
be
taken
to
his
own
room
oh
no
madame
hastily
replied
the
proprietor
politely
but
coldly
and
not
in
english
but
in
french
he
was
no
longer
interested
in
the
trifling
sum
the
guests
from
san
francisco
would
leave
at
his
cash
desk
that
is
absolutely
impossible
adding
by
way
of
explanation
that
he
valued
that
suite
of
rooms
highly
and
that
should
he
accede
to
request
the
news
would
be
known
all
over
capri
and
no
one
would
take
the
suite
afterwards
the
young
lady
who
had
glanced
at
him
strangely
all
the
time
now
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
sobbed
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
the
elder
lady
tears
dried
at
once
her
face
flared
up
raising
her
voice
and
using
her
own
language
she
began
to
insist
unable
to
believe
that
the
respect
for
them
had
gone
already
the
manager
cut
her
short
with
polite
dignity
if
madame
does
not
like
the
ways
of
the
hotel
he
dare
not
detain
her
and
he
announced
decisively
that
the
corpse
must
be
removed
at
dawn
the
police
had
already
been
notified
and
an
official
would
arrive
presently
to
attend
to
the
necessary
formalities
is
it
possible
to
get
a
plain
coffin
madame
asked
unfortunately
not
impossible
and
there
was
no
time
to
make
one
it
would
have
to
be
arranged
somehow
yes
the
english
came
in
large
strong
boxes
if
the
divisions
were
removed
the
whole
hotel
was
asleep
the
window
of
no
was
open
on
to
a
corner
of
the
garden
where
under
a
high
stone
wall
ridged
with
broken
glass
grew
a
battered
banana
tree
the
light
was
turned
off
the
door
locked
the
room
deserted
the
deceased
remained
in
the
darkness
blue
stars
glanced
at
him
from
the
black
sky
a
cricket
started
to
chirp
with
sad
carelessness
in
the
wall
out
in
the
corridor
two
chambermaids
were
seated
in
a
mending
something
entered
luigi
in
slippers
with
a
heap
of
clothes
in
his
hand
pronto
he
asked
in
a
singing
whisper
indicating
with
his
eyes
the
dreadful
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
then
giving
a
slight
wave
thither
with
his
free
hand
patenza
he
shouted
in
a
whisper
as
though
sending
off
a
train
the
chambermaids
choking
with
noiseless
laughter
dropped
their
heads
on
each
other
shoulders
luigi
went
to
the
very
door
tapped
and
cocking
his
head
on
one
side
asked
respectfully
in
a
subdued
tone
ha
suonato
signore
then
contracting
his
throat
and
shoving
out
his
jaw
he
answered
himself
in
a
grating
drawling
mournful
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
behind
the
door
come
in
when
the
dawn
grew
white
at
the
window
of
no
and
a
damp
wind
began
rustling
the
tattered
fronds
of
the
banana
tree
as
the
blue
sky
of
morning
lifted
and
unfolded
over
capri
and
monte
solaro
pure
and
distinct
grew
golden
catching
the
sun
which
was
rising
beyond
the
blue
mountains
of
italy
just
as
the
labourers
who
were
mending
the
paths
of
the
islands
for
the
tourists
came
out
for
work
a
long
box
was
carried
into
room
no
soon
this
box
weighed
heavily
and
it
painfully
pressed
the
knees
of
the
porter
who
was
carrying
it
in
a
cab
down
the
winding
white
between
stone
walls
and
vineyards
down
down
the
face
of
capri
to
the
sea
the
driver
a
weakly
little
fellow
with
reddened
eyes
in
a
little
old
jacket
with
sleeves
too
short
and
bursting
boots
kept
flogging
his
wiry
small
horse
that
was
decorated
in
sicilian
fashion
its
harness
tinkling
with
busy
little
bells
and
fringed
with
fringes
of
scarlet
wool
the
high
gleaming
with
copper
and
tufted
with
colour
and
a
plume
nodding
from
the
pony
cropped
head
from
between
the
ears
the
cabby
had
spent
the
whole
night
playing
dice
in
the
inn
and
was
still
under
the
effects
of
drink
silent
he
was
depressed
by
his
own
debauchery
and
vice
by
the
fact
that
he
gambled
away
to
the
last
farthing
all
those
copper
coins
with
which
his
pockets
had
yesterday
been
full
in
all
four
lire
forty
centesimi
but
the
morning
was
fresh
in
such
air
with
the
sea
all
round
under
the
morning
sky
headaches
evaporate
and
man
soon
regains
his
cheerfulness
moreover
the
cabby
was
cheered
by
this
unexpected
fare
which
he
was
making
out
of
some
gentleman
from
san
francisco
who
was
nodding
with
his
dead
head
in
a
box
at
the
back
the
little
steamer
which
lay
like
a
on
the
tender
bright
blueness
which
brims
the
bay
of
naples
was
already
giving
the
final
hoots
and
this
tooting
resounded
again
cheerily
all
over
the
island
each
contour
each
ridge
each
rock
was
so
clearly
visible
in
every
direction
it
was
as
if
there
were
no
atmosphere
at
all
near
the
beach
the
porter
in
the
cab
was
overtaken
by
the
head
porter
dashing
down
in
an
automobile
with
the
lady
and
her
daughter
both
pale
their
eyes
swollen
with
the
tears
of
a
sleepless
night
and
in
ten
minutes
the
little
steamer
again
churned
up
the
water
and
made
her
way
back
to
sorrento
to
castellamare
bearing
away
from
capri
for
ever
the
family
from
san
francisco
and
peace
and
tranquillity
reigned
once
more
on
the
island
on
that
island
two
thousand
years
ago
lived
a
man
entangled
in
his
own
infamous
and
strange
acts
one
whose
rule
for
some
reason
extended
over
millions
of
people
and
who
having
lost
his
head
through
the
absurdity
of
such
power
committed
deeds
which
have
established
him
for
ever
in
the
memory
of
mankind
mankind
which
in
the
mass
now
rules
the
world
just
as
hideously
and
incomprehensibly
as
he
ruled
it
then
and
men
come
here
from
all
quarters
of
the
globe
to
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
stone
house
where
that
one
man
lived
on
the
brink
of
one
of
the
steepest
cliffs
in
the
island
on
this
exquisite
morning
all
who
had
come
to
capri
for
that
purpose
were
still
asleep
in
the
hotels
although
through
the
streets
already
trotted
little
donkeys
with
red
saddles
towards
the
hotel
entrances
where
they
would
wait
patiently
until
after
a
good
sleep
and
a
square
meal
young
and
old
american
men
and
women
german
men
and
women
would
emerge
and
be
hoisted
up
into
the
saddles
to
be
followed
up
the
stony
paths
yea
to
the
very
summit
of
monte
tiberio
by
old
persistent
of
capri
with
sticks
in
their
sinewy
hands
quieted
by
the
fact
that
the
dead
old
gentleman
from
san
francisco
who
had
intended
to
be
one
of
the
pleasure
party
but
who
had
only
succeeded
in
frightening
the
rest
with
the
reminder
of
death
was
now
being
shipped
to
naples
the
happy
tourists
still
slept
soundly
the
island
was
still
quiet
the
shops
in
the
little
town
not
yet
open
only
fish
and
greens
were
being
sold
in
the
tiny
piazza
only
simple
folk
were
present
and
amongst
them
as
usual
without
occupation
the
tall
old
boatman
lorenzo
thorough
debauchee
and
handsome
figure
famous
all
over
italy
model
for
many
a
picture
he
had
already
sold
for
a
trifle
two
lobsters
which
he
had
caught
in
the
night
and
which
were
rustling
in
the
apron
of
the
cook
of
that
very
same
hotel
where
the
family
from
san
francisco
had
spent
the
night
and
now
lorenzo
could
stand
calmly
till
evening
with
a
majestic
air
showing
off
his
rags
and
gazing
round
holding
his
clay
pipe
with
its
long
reed
in
his
hand
and
letting
his
scarlet
bonnet
slip
over
one
ear
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
received
a
salary
from
the
little
town
from
the
commune
which
found
it
profitable
to
pay
him
to
stand
about
and
make
a
picturesque
figure
as
everybody
knows
down
the
precipices
of
monte
solaro
down
the
stony
little
stairs
cut
in
the
rock
of
the
old
phœnician
road
came
two
abruzzi
mountaineers
descending
from
anacapri
one
carried
a
bagpipe
under
his
leather
cloak
a
large
goat
skin
with
two
little
pipes
the
other
had
a
sort
of
wooden
flute
they
descended
and
the
whole
land
joyous
was
sunny
beneath
them
they
saw
the
rocky
heaving
shoulder
of
the
island
which
lay
almost
entirely
at
their
feet
swimming
in
the
fairy
blueness
of
the
water
shining
morning
vapours
rose
over
the
sea
to
the
east
under
a
dazzling
sun
which
already
burned
hot
as
it
rose
higher
and
higher
and
there
far
off
the
dimly
cerulean
masses
of
italy
of
her
near
and
far
mountains
still
wavered
blue
as
if
in
the
world
morning
in
a
beauty
no
words
can
express
halfway
down
the
descent
the
pipers
slackened
their
pace
above
the
road
in
a
grotto
of
the
rocky
face
of
monte
solaro
stood
the
mother
of
god
the
sun
full
upon
her
giving
her
a
splendour
of
and
blue
raiment
and
royal
crown
rusty
from
all
weathers
meek
and
merciful
she
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
to
the
eternal
and
blessed
mansions
of
her
son
the
pipers
bared
their
heads
put
their
pipes
to
their
lips
and
there
streamed
forth
naive
and
meekly
joyous
praises
to
the
sun
to
the
morning
to
her
immaculate
who
would
intercede
for
all
who
suffer
in
this
malicious
and
lovely
world
and
to
him
born
of
her
womb
among
the
caves
of
bethlehem
in
a
lowly
shepherd
hut
in
the
far
judean
land
and
the
body
of
the
dead
old
man
from
san
francisco
was
returning
home
to
its
grave
to
the
shores
of
the
new
world
having
been
subjected
to
many
humiliations
much
human
neglect
after
a
week
wandering
from
one
warehouse
to
another
it
was
carried
at
last
on
to
the
same
renowned
vessel
which
so
short
a
time
ago
and
with
such
honour
had
borne
him
living
to
the
old
world
but
now
he
was
to
be
hidden
far
from
the
knowledge
of
the
voyagers
closed
in
a
coffin
he
was
lowered
deep
into
the
vessel
dark
hold
and
again
again
the
ship
set
out
on
the
long
voyage
she
passed
at
night
near
capri
and
to
those
who
were
looking
out
from
the
island
sad
seemed
the
lights
of
the
ship
slowly
hiding
themselves
in
the
sea
darkness
but
there
aboard
the
liner
in
the
bright
halls
shining
with
lights
and
marble
gay
dancing
filled
the
evening
as
usual
the
second
evening
and
the
third
evening
still
they
danced
amid
a
storm
that
swept
over
the
ocean
booming
like
a
funeral
service
rolling
up
mountains
of
mourning
darkness
silvered
with
foam
through
the
snow
the
numerous
fiery
eyes
of
the
ship
were
hardly
visible
to
the
devil
who
watched
from
the
rocks
of
gibraltar
from
the
stony
gateway
of
two
worlds
peering
after
the
vessel
as
she
disappeared
into
the
night
and
storm
the
devil
was
huge
as
a
cliff
but
huger
still
was
the
liner
many
storeyed
many
funnelled
created
by
the
presumption
of
the
new
man
with
the
old
heart
the
blizzard
smote
the
rigging
and
the
funnels
and
whitened
the
ship
with
snow
but
she
was
enduring
firm
majestic
and
horrible
on
the
topmost
deck
rose
lonely
amongst
the
snowy
whirlwind
the
cosy
and
dim
quarters
where
lay
the
heavy
master
of
the
ship
he
who
was
like
a
pagan
idol
sunk
now
in
a
light
uneasy
slumber
through
his
sleep
he
heard
the
sombre
howl
and
furious
screechings
of
the
siren
muffled
by
the
blizzard
but
again
he
reassured
himself
by
the
nearness
of
that
which
stood
behind
his
wall
and
was
in
the
last
resort
incomprehensible
to
him
by
the
large
apparently
armoured
cabin
which
was
now
and
then
filled
with
a
mysterious
rumbling
throbbing
and
crackling
of
blue
fires
that
flared
up
explosive
around
the
pale
face
of
the
telegraphist
who
with
a
metal
hoop
fixed
on
his
head
was
eagerly
straining
to
catch
the
dim
voices
of
vessels
which
spoke
to
him
from
hundreds
of
miles
away
in
the
depths
in
the
womb
of
the
steel
glimmered
and
steam
wheezed
and
huge
masses
of
machinery
and
boilers
dripped
with
water
and
oil
as
the
motion
of
the
ship
was
steadily
cooked
in
this
vast
kitchen
heated
by
hellish
furnaces
from
beneath
here
bubbled
in
their
awful
concentration
the
powers
which
were
being
transmitted
to
the
keel
down
an
infinitely
long
round
tunnel
lit
up
and
brilliant
like
a
gigantic
along
which
slowly
with
a
regularity
crushing
to
the
human
soul
revolved
a
gigantic
shaft
precisely
like
a
living
monster
coiling
and
uncoiling
its
endless
length
down
the
tunnel
sliding
on
its
bed
of
oil
the
middle
of
the
the
warm
luxurious
cabins
halls
shed
light
and
joy
buzzed
with
the
chatter
of
an
elegant
crowd
was
fragrant
with
fresh
flowers
and
quivered
with
the
sounds
of
a
string
orchestra
and
again
amidst
that
crowd
amidst
the
brilliance
of
lights
silks
diamonds
and
bare
feminine
shoulders
a
slim
and
supple
pair
of
hired
lovers
painfully
writhed
and
at
moments
convulsively
clashed
a
sinfully
discreet
pretty
girl
with
lowered
lashes
and
hair
innocently
dressed
and
a
tallish
young
man
with
black
hair
looking
as
if
it
were
glued
on
pale
with
powder
and
wearing
the
most
elegant
shoes
and
a
narrow
dress
coat
a
beau
resembling
an
enormous
leech
and
no
one
knew
that
this
couple
had
long
since
grown
weary
of
shamly
tormenting
themselves
with
their
beatific
to
the
sound
of
music
nor
did
any
one
know
of
that
thing
which
lay
deep
deep
below
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
dark
hold
near
the
gloomy
and
sultry
bowels
of
the
ship
that
was
so
gravely
overcoming
the
darkness
the
ocean
the
blizzard
gentle
breathing
in
the
cemetery
above
a
fresh
mound
of
earth
stands
a
new
cross
of
oak
strong
heavy
smooth
a
pleasant
thing
to
look
at
it
is
april
but
the
days
are
grey
from
a
long
way
off
one
can
see
through
the
bare
trees
the
in
the
cemetery
a
spacious
real
country
or
cathedral
town
cemetery
the
cold
wind
goes
whistling
whistling
through
the
china
wreath
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
in
the
cross
itself
is
set
a
rather
large
bronze
medallion
and
in
the
medallion
is
a
portrait
of
a
smart
and
charming
with
happy
astonishingly
vivacious
eyes
it
is
olga
meschersky
as
a
little
girl
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
her
in
the
noisy
crowd
of
brown
dresses
which
made
its
discordant
and
youthful
hum
in
the
corridors
and
all
that
one
could
say
of
her
was
that
she
was
just
one
of
a
number
of
pretty
rich
happy
little
girls
that
she
was
clever
but
playful
and
very
careless
of
the
precepts
of
her
then
she
began
to
develop
and
to
blossom
not
by
days
but
by
hours
at
fourteen
with
a
slim
waist
and
graceful
legs
there
was
already
well
developed
the
outline
of
her
breasts
and
all
those
contours
of
which
the
charm
has
never
yet
been
expressed
in
human
words
at
fifteen
she
was
said
to
be
a
beauty
how
carefully
some
of
her
school
friends
did
their
hair
how
clean
they
were
how
careful
and
restrained
in
their
movements
but
she
was
afraid
of
nothing
neither
of
on
her
fingers
nor
of
a
flushed
face
nor
of
dishevelled
hair
nor
of
a
bare
knee
after
a
rush
and
a
tumble
without
a
thought
or
an
effort
on
her
part
imperceptibly
there
came
to
her
everything
which
so
distinguished
her
from
the
rest
of
the
school
during
her
last
two
years
daintiness
smartness
quickness
the
bright
and
intelligent
gleam
in
her
eyes
no
one
danced
like
olga
meschersky
no
one
could
run
or
skate
like
her
no
one
at
dances
had
as
many
admirers
as
she
had
and
for
some
reason
no
one
was
so
popular
with
the
junior
classes
imperceptibly
she
grew
up
into
a
girl
and
imperceptibly
her
fame
in
the
school
became
established
and
already
there
were
rumours
that
she
is
flighty
that
she
can
not
live
without
admirers
that
the
schoolboy
shensin
is
madly
in
love
with
her
that
she
too
perhaps
loves
him
but
is
so
changeable
in
her
treatment
of
him
that
he
tried
to
commit
suicide
during
her
last
winter
olga
meschersky
went
quite
crazy
with
happiness
so
they
said
at
school
it
was
a
snowy
sunny
frosty
winter
the
sun
would
go
down
early
behind
the
grove
of
tall
in
the
snowy
school
garden
but
it
was
always
fine
and
radiant
weather
with
a
promise
of
frost
and
sun
again
a
walk
in
cathedral
street
skating
in
the
town
park
a
pink
sunset
music
and
that
perpetually
moving
crowd
in
which
olga
meschersky
seemed
to
be
the
smartest
the
most
careless
and
the
happiest
and
then
one
day
when
she
was
rushing
like
a
whirlwind
through
the
recreation
room
with
the
little
girls
chasing
her
and
screaming
for
joy
she
was
unexpectedly
called
up
to
the
headmistress
she
stopped
short
took
one
deep
breath
with
a
quick
movement
already
a
habit
arranged
her
hair
gave
a
pull
to
the
corners
of
her
apron
to
bring
it
up
on
her
shoulders
and
with
shining
eyes
ran
upstairs
the
headmistress
small
youngish
but
sat
quietly
with
her
knitting
in
her
hands
at
the
under
the
portrait
of
the
tsar
good
morning
miss
meschersky
she
said
in
french
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
knitting
i
am
sorry
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
had
to
call
you
here
to
speak
to
you
about
your
behaviour
i
am
attending
madam
answered
olga
coming
up
to
the
table
looking
at
her
brightly
and
happily
but
with
an
expressionless
face
and
curtsying
so
lightly
and
gracefully
as
only
she
could
you
will
attend
badly
unfortunately
i
have
become
convinced
of
that
said
the
headmistress
giving
a
pull
at
the
thread
so
that
the
ball
rolled
away
over
the
polished
floor
and
olga
watched
it
with
curiosity
the
headmistress
raised
her
eyes
i
shall
not
repeat
myself
i
shall
not
say
much
she
said
olga
very
much
liked
the
unusually
clean
and
large
study
on
frosty
days
the
air
in
it
was
so
pleasant
with
the
warmth
from
the
shining
dutch
and
the
fresh
on
the
she
glanced
at
the
young
tsar
painted
in
a
splendid
hall
at
the
smooth
parting
in
the
white
neatly
waved
hair
of
the
headmistress
she
waited
in
silence
you
are
no
longer
a
little
girl
said
the
headmistress
meaningly
beginning
to
feel
secretly
irritated
yes
madam
answered
olga
simply
almost
merrily
but
neither
are
you
a
woman
yet
said
the
headmistress
still
more
meaningly
and
her
pale
face
flushed
a
little
to
begin
with
why
do
you
do
your
hair
like
that
you
do
it
like
a
woman
it
is
not
my
fault
madam
that
i
have
nice
hair
olga
replied
and
gave
a
little
touch
with
both
hands
to
her
beautifully
dressed
hair
ah
is
that
it
you
are
not
to
blame
said
the
headmistress
you
are
not
to
blame
for
the
way
you
do
your
hair
you
are
not
to
blame
for
those
expensive
combs
you
are
not
to
blame
for
ruining
your
parents
with
your
shoes
but
i
repeat
you
completely
forget
that
you
are
still
only
a
schoolgirl
and
here
olga
without
losing
her
simplicity
and
calm
suddenly
interrupted
her
politely
excuse
me
madam
you
are
mistaken
i
am
a
woman
and
do
you
know
who
is
to
blame
for
that
my
father
friend
and
neighbour
your
brother
alexey
mikhailovitch
malyntin
it
happened
last
summer
in
the
country
and
a
month
after
this
conversation
a
cossack
officer
ungainly
and
of
plebeian
appearance
who
had
absolutely
nothing
in
common
with
olga
meschersky
circle
shot
her
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
station
in
a
large
crowd
of
people
who
had
just
arrived
by
train
and
the
incredible
confession
of
olga
meschersky
which
had
stunned
the
headmistress
was
completely
confirmed
the
officer
told
the
coroner
that
meschersky
had
led
him
on
had
had
a
with
him
had
promised
to
marry
him
and
at
the
railway
station
on
the
day
of
the
murder
while
seeing
him
off
to
novocherkask
had
suddenly
told
him
that
she
had
never
thought
of
marrying
him
that
all
the
talk
about
marriage
was
only
to
make
a
fool
of
him
and
she
gave
him
her
diary
to
read
with
the
pages
in
it
which
told
about
malyntin
i
glanced
through
those
pages
said
the
officer
went
out
on
to
the
platform
where
she
was
walking
up
and
down
and
waiting
for
me
to
finish
reading
it
and
i
shot
her
the
diary
is
in
the
pocket
of
my
overcoat
look
at
the
entry
for
july
of
last
year
and
this
is
what
the
coroner
read
it
is
now
nearly
two
in
the
morning
i
fell
sound
asleep
but
woke
up
again
immediately
i
have
become
a
woman
papa
mamma
and
tolya
had
all
gone
to
town
and
i
was
left
alone
i
can
not
say
how
happy
i
was
to
be
alone
in
the
morning
i
walked
in
the
orchard
in
the
field
and
i
went
into
the
woods
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
all
by
myself
in
the
whole
world
and
i
never
had
such
pleasant
thoughts
before
i
had
lunch
by
myself
then
i
played
for
an
hour
and
the
music
made
me
feel
that
i
should
live
for
ever
and
be
happier
than
any
one
else
had
ever
been
then
i
fell
asleep
in
papa
study
and
at
four
kate
woke
me
and
said
that
alexey
mikhailovitch
had
come
i
was
very
glad
to
see
him
it
was
so
pleasant
to
receive
him
and
entertain
him
he
came
with
his
pair
of
viatka
horses
very
beautiful
and
they
stood
all
the
time
at
the
front
door
but
he
stayed
because
it
was
raining
and
hoped
that
the
roads
would
dry
towards
evening
he
was
very
sorry
not
to
find
papa
at
home
was
very
animated
and
treated
me
very
politely
and
made
many
jokes
about
his
having
been
long
in
love
with
me
before
tea
we
walked
in
the
garden
and
the
weather
was
charming
the
sun
shining
through
the
whole
wet
garden
but
it
grew
quite
cold
and
he
walked
with
me
arm
in
arm
and
said
that
he
was
faust
with
margarete
he
is
but
still
very
handsome
and
always
very
well
dressed
the
only
thing
i
did
like
was
his
coming
in
a
sort
of
cape
he
smells
of
english
and
his
eyes
are
quite
young
black
his
beard
is
long
and
elegantly
parted
down
the
middle
it
is
quite
silvery
we
had
tea
in
the
glass
verandah
and
suddenly
i
did
not
feel
very
well
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
while
he
smoked
then
he
sat
down
near
me
and
began
to
say
nice
things
and
then
to
take
my
hand
and
kiss
it
i
covered
my
face
with
a
silk
handkerchief
and
several
times
he
kissed
me
on
the
lips
through
the
handkerchief
i
ca
understand
how
it
happened
i
went
mad
i
never
thought
i
was
like
that
now
i
have
only
one
way
out
i
feel
such
a
loathing
for
him
that
i
can
not
endure
it
the
town
in
these
april
days
has
become
clean
and
dry
its
stones
have
become
white
and
it
is
easy
and
pleasant
to
walk
on
them
every
sunday
after
mass
along
cathedral
street
which
leads
out
of
the
town
there
walks
a
little
woman
in
mourning
in
black
kid
gloves
and
with
an
ebony
sunshade
she
crosses
the
yard
of
the
crosses
the
dirty
by
the
road
where
there
are
many
black
smithies
and
where
the
wind
blows
fresher
from
the
fields
in
the
distance
between
the
monastery
and
the
gaol
is
the
white
slope
of
the
sky
and
the
grey
of
the
spring
fields
and
then
when
you
have
passed
the
muddy
pools
behind
the
monastery
wall
and
turn
to
the
left
you
will
see
what
looks
like
a
large
low
garden
surrounded
by
a
white
wall
on
the
gates
of
which
is
written
the
assumption
of
our
lady
the
little
woman
makes
rapid
little
signs
of
the
cross
and
always
walks
on
the
main
path
when
she
gets
to
the
bench
opposite
the
oak
cross
she
sits
down
in
the
wind
and
the
chilly
spring
for
an
hour
two
hours
until
her
feet
in
the
light
boots
and
her
hand
in
the
narrow
kid
glove
grow
quite
cold
listening
to
the
birds
of
spring
singing
sweetly
even
in
the
cold
listening
to
the
whistling
of
the
wind
through
the
porcelain
wreath
she
sometimes
thinks
that
she
would
give
half
her
life
if
only
that
dead
wreath
might
not
be
before
her
eyes
the
thought
that
it
is
olga
meschersky
who
has
been
buried
in
that
clay
plunges
her
into
astonishment
bordering
upon
stupidity
how
can
one
associate
the
who
but
two
or
three
months
ago
was
so
full
of
life
charm
happiness
with
that
mound
of
earth
and
that
oak
cross
is
it
possible
that
beneath
it
is
the
same
girl
whose
eyes
shine
out
immortally
from
this
bronze
medallion
and
how
can
one
connect
this
bright
look
with
the
horrible
event
which
is
associated
now
with
olga
meschersky
but
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
the
little
woman
is
happy
as
are
all
those
who
are
in
love
or
are
generally
devoted
to
some
passionate
dream
the
woman
is
olga
meschersky
a
girl
over
thirty
who
has
for
long
been
living
on
some
illusion
and
putting
it
in
the
place
of
her
actual
life
at
first
the
illusion
was
her
brother
a
poor
lieutenant
in
no
way
remarkable
her
whole
soul
was
bound
up
in
him
and
in
his
future
which
for
some
reason
she
imagined
as
splendid
and
she
lived
in
the
curious
expectation
that
thanks
to
him
her
fate
would
transport
her
into
some
fairyland
then
when
he
was
killed
at
mukden
she
persuaded
herself
that
she
very
happily
is
not
like
others
that
instead
of
beauty
and
womanliness
she
has
intellect
and
higher
interests
that
she
is
a
worker
for
the
ideal
and
now
olga
meschersky
is
the
object
of
all
her
thoughts
of
her
admiration
and
joy
every
holiday
she
goes
to
her
grave
she
had
formed
the
habit
of
going
to
the
cemetery
after
the
death
of
her
brother
for
hours
she
never
takes
her
eyes
off
the
oak
cross
she
recalls
olga
meschersky
pale
face
in
the
coffin
amid
the
flowers
and
remembers
what
she
once
overheard
once
during
the
luncheon
hour
while
walking
in
the
school
garden
olga
meschersky
was
quickly
quickly
saying
to
her
favourite
friend
the
tall
plump
subbotin
i
have
been
reading
one
of
papa
books
he
has
a
lot
of
funny
old
books
i
read
about
the
kind
of
beauty
which
woman
ought
to
possess
there
such
a
lot
written
there
you
see
i
ca
remember
it
all
well
of
course
eyes
black
as
boiling
pitch
upon
my
word
that
what
they
say
there
boiling
pitch
black
as
night
and
a
tender
flush
in
the
complexion
a
slim
figure
hands
longer
than
the
ordinary
little
feet
a
fairly
large
breast
a
regularly
rounded
leg
a
knee
the
colour
of
the
inside
of
a
shell
high
but
sloping
shoulders
a
good
deal
of
it
i
have
nearly
learnt
by
heart
it
is
all
so
true
but
do
you
know
what
the
chief
thing
is
gentle
breathing
and
i
have
got
it
you
listen
how
i
breathe
is
it
gentle
now
the
gentle
breathing
has
again
vanished
away
into
the
world
into
the
cloudy
day
into
the
cold
spring
wind
kasimir
stanislavovitch
on
the
yellow
card
with
a
nobleman
coronet
the
young
porter
at
the
hotel
versailles
somehow
managed
to
read
the
christian
name
and
patronymic
kasimir
stanislavovitch
there
followed
something
still
more
complicated
and
still
more
difficult
to
pronounce
the
porter
turned
the
card
this
way
and
that
way
in
his
hand
looked
at
the
passport
which
the
visitor
had
given
him
with
it
shrugged
his
shoulders
none
of
those
who
stayed
at
the
versailles
gave
their
cards
then
he
threw
both
on
to
the
table
and
began
again
to
examine
himself
in
the
silvery
milky
mirror
which
hung
above
the
table
whipping
up
his
thick
hair
with
a
comb
he
wore
an
overcoat
and
shiny
the
gold
braid
on
his
cap
was
greasy
with
age
the
hotel
was
a
bad
one
kasimir
stanislavovitch
left
kiev
for
moscow
on
april
good
friday
on
receiving
a
telegram
with
the
one
word
tenth
somehow
or
other
he
managed
to
get
the
money
for
his
fare
and
took
his
seat
in
a
compartment
grey
and
dim
but
really
giving
him
the
sensation
of
comfort
and
luxury
the
train
was
heated
and
that
heat
and
the
smell
of
the
heating
apparatus
and
the
sharp
tapping
of
the
little
hammers
in
it
reminded
kasimir
stanislavovitch
of
other
times
at
times
it
seemed
to
him
that
winter
had
returned
that
in
the
fields
the
white
very
white
drifts
of
snow
had
covered
up
the
yellowish
bristle
of
stubble
and
the
large
leaden
pools
where
the
swam
but
often
the
stopped
suddenly
and
melted
the
fields
grew
bright
and
one
felt
that
behind
the
clouds
was
much
light
and
the
wet
platforms
of
the
looked
black
and
the
rooks
called
from
the
naked
poplars
at
each
big
station
kasimir
stanislavovitch
went
to
the
for
a
drink
and
returned
to
his
carriage
with
newspapers
in
his
hands
but
he
did
not
read
them
he
only
sat
and
sank
in
the
thick
smoke
of
his
cigarettes
which
burned
and
glowed
and
to
none
of
his
neighbours
odessa
jews
who
played
cards
all
the
time
did
he
say
a
single
word
he
wore
an
autumn
overcoat
of
which
the
pockets
were
worn
a
very
old
black
and
new
but
heavy
cheap
boots
his
hands
the
typical
hands
of
an
habitual
drunkard
and
an
old
inhabitant
of
basements
shook
when
he
lit
a
match
everything
else
about
him
spoke
of
poverty
and
drunkenness
no
cuffs
a
dirty
linen
collar
an
ancient
tie
an
inflamed
and
ravaged
face
watery
eyes
his
dyed
with
a
bad
brown
dye
had
an
unnatural
appearance
he
looked
tired
and
contemptuous
the
train
reached
moscow
next
day
not
at
all
up
to
time
it
was
seven
hours
late
the
weather
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
but
better
and
drier
than
in
kiev
with
something
stirring
in
the
air
kasimir
stanislavovitch
took
a
cab
without
bargaining
with
the
driver
and
told
him
to
drive
straight
to
the
versailles
i
have
known
that
hotel
my
good
fellow
he
said
suddenly
breaking
his
silence
since
my
student
days
from
the
versailles
as
soon
as
his
little
bag
tied
with
stout
rope
had
been
taken
up
to
his
room
he
immediately
went
out
it
was
nearly
evening
the
air
was
warm
the
black
trees
on
the
boulevards
were
turning
green
everywhere
there
were
crowds
of
people
cars
carts
moscow
was
trafficking
and
doing
business
was
returning
to
the
usual
pressing
work
was
ending
her
holiday
and
unconsciously
welcomed
the
spring
a
man
who
has
lived
his
life
and
ruined
it
feels
lonely
on
a
spring
evening
in
a
strange
crowded
city
kasimir
stanislavovitch
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
tverskoy
boulevard
he
saw
once
more
the
figure
of
the
musing
poushkin
the
golden
and
lilac
top
of
the
strasnoy
monastery
for
about
an
hour
he
sat
at
the
café
filippov
drank
chocolate
and
read
old
comic
papers
then
he
went
to
a
cinema
whose
flaming
signs
shone
from
far
away
down
the
tverskaya
through
the
darkling
twilight
from
the
cinema
he
drove
to
a
restaurant
on
the
boulevard
which
he
had
also
known
in
his
student
days
he
was
driven
by
an
old
man
bent
in
a
bow
sad
gloomy
deeply
absorbed
in
himself
in
his
old
age
in
his
dark
thoughts
all
the
way
the
man
painfully
and
wearily
helped
on
his
lazy
horse
with
his
whole
being
murmuring
something
to
it
all
the
time
and
occasionally
bitterly
reproaching
it
and
at
last
when
he
reached
the
place
he
allowed
the
load
to
slip
from
his
shoulders
for
a
moment
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
as
he
took
the
money
i
did
not
catch
the
name
and
thought
you
meant
he
muttered
turning
his
horse
slowly
he
seemed
displeased
although
the
prague
was
further
away
i
remember
the
too
old
fellow
answered
kasimir
stanislavovitch
you
must
have
been
driving
for
a
long
time
in
moscow
driving
the
old
man
said
i
have
been
driving
now
for
years
that
means
that
you
may
have
driven
me
before
said
kasimir
stanislavovitch
perhaps
i
did
answered
the
old
man
dryly
there
are
lots
of
people
in
the
world
one
ca
remember
all
of
you
of
the
old
restaurant
once
known
to
kasimir
stanislavovitch
there
remained
only
the
name
now
it
was
a
large
though
vulgar
restaurant
over
the
entrance
burnt
an
electric
globe
which
illuminated
with
its
unpleasant
heliotrope
light
the
smart
cabmen
impudent
and
cruel
to
their
lean
steeds
in
the
damp
hall
stood
pots
of
laurels
and
tropical
plants
of
the
kind
which
one
sees
carried
on
to
the
platforms
from
weddings
to
funerals
and
from
the
porters
lodge
several
men
rushed
out
together
to
kasimir
stanislavovitch
and
all
of
them
had
just
the
same
thick
curl
of
hair
as
the
porter
at
the
versailles
in
the
large
greenish
room
decorated
in
the
rococo
style
were
a
multitude
of
broad
mirrors
and
in
the
corner
burnt
a
crimson
the
room
was
still
empty
and
only
a
few
of
the
electric
lights
were
on
kasimir
stanislavovitch
sat
for
a
long
time
alone
doing
nothing
one
felt
that
behind
the
windows
with
their
white
blinds
the
long
spring
evening
had
not
yet
grown
dark
one
heard
from
the
street
the
thudding
of
hooves
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
was
the
monotonous
of
the
little
fountain
in
an
aquarium
round
which
with
their
scales
peeling
off
lighted
somehow
from
below
swam
through
the
water
a
waiter
in
white
brought
the
dinner
things
bread
and
a
decanter
of
cold
vodka
kasimir
stanislavovitch
began
drinking
the
vodka
held
it
in
his
mouth
before
swallowing
it
and
having
swallowed
it
smelt
the
black
bread
as
though
with
loathing
with
a
suddenness
which
gave
even
him
a
start
a
gramophone
began
to
roar
out
through
the
room
a
mixture
of
russian
songs
now
exaggeratedly
boisterous
and
turbulent
now
too
tender
drawling
sentimental
and
kasimir
stanislavovitch
eyes
grew
red
and
tears
filmed
them
at
that
sweet
and
snuffling
drone
of
the
machine
then
a
curly
georgian
brought
him
on
a
large
iron
fork
a
smelly
shashlyk
cut
off
the
meat
on
to
the
plate
with
a
kind
of
dissolute
smartness
and
with
asiatic
simplicity
with
his
own
hand
sprinkled
it
with
onions
salt
and
rusty
barbery
powder
while
the
gramophone
roared
out
in
the
empty
hall
a
inciting
one
to
jerks
and
spasms
then
kasimir
stanislavovitch
was
served
with
cheese
fruit
red
wine
coffee
mineral
water
liquers
the
gramophone
had
long
ago
grown
silent
instead
of
it
there
had
been
playing
on
the
platform
an
orchestra
of
german
women
dressed
in
white
the
lighted
hall
continually
filling
up
with
people
grew
hot
became
dim
with
tobacco
smoke
and
heavily
saturated
with
the
smell
of
food
waiters
rushed
about
in
a
whirl
drunken
people
ordered
cigars
which
immediately
made
them
sick
the
showed
excessive
officiousness
combined
with
an
intense
realization
of
their
own
dignity
in
the
mirrors
in
the
watery
gloom
of
their
abysses
there
was
more
and
more
chaotically
reflected
something
huge
noisy
complicated
several
times
kasimir
stanislavovitch
went
out
of
the
hot
hall
into
the
cool
corridors
into
the
cold
lavatory
where
there
was
a
strange
smell
of
the
sea
he
walked
as
if
on
air
and
on
returning
to
his
table
again
ordered
wine
after
midnight
closing
his
eyes
and
drawing
the
fresh
night
air
through
his
nostrils
into
his
intoxicated
head
he
raced
in
a
on
rubber
tyres
out
of
the
town
to
a
brothel
he
saw
in
the
distance
infinite
chains
of
light
running
away
somewhere
down
hill
and
then
up
hill
again
but
he
saw
it
just
as
if
it
were
not
he
but
some
one
else
seeing
it
in
the
brothel
he
nearly
had
a
fight
with
a
stout
gentleman
who
attacked
him
shouting
that
he
was
known
to
all
thinking
russia
then
he
lay
dressed
on
a
broad
bed
covered
with
a
satin
quilt
in
a
little
room
from
the
ceiling
by
a
lantern
with
a
sickly
smell
of
scented
soap
and
with
dresses
hanging
from
a
hook
on
the
door
near
the
bed
stood
a
dish
of
fruit
and
the
girl
who
had
been
hired
to
entertain
kasimir
stanislavovitch
silently
greedily
with
relish
ate
a
pear
cutting
off
slices
with
a
knife
and
her
friend
with
fat
bare
arms
dressed
only
in
a
chemise
which
made
her
look
like
a
little
girl
was
rapidly
writing
on
the
taking
no
notice
of
them
she
wrote
and
wept
of
what
there
are
lots
of
people
in
the
world
one
ca
know
everything
on
the
tenth
of
april
kasimir
stanislavovitch
woke
up
early
judging
from
the
start
with
which
he
opened
his
eyes
one
could
see
that
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
idea
that
he
was
in
moscow
he
had
got
back
after
four
in
the
morning
he
staggered
down
the
staircase
of
the
versailles
but
without
a
mistake
he
went
straight
to
his
room
down
the
long
stinking
tunnel
of
a
corridor
which
was
lighted
only
at
its
entrance
by
a
little
lamp
smoking
sleepily
outside
every
room
stood
boots
and
shoes
all
of
strangers
unknown
to
one
another
hostile
to
one
another
suddenly
a
door
opened
almost
terrifying
kasimir
stanislavovitch
on
its
threshold
appeared
an
old
man
looking
like
a
actor
acting
the
memoirs
of
a
lunatic
and
kasimir
stanislavovitch
saw
a
lamp
under
a
green
shade
and
a
room
crowded
with
things
the
cave
of
a
lonely
old
lodger
with
icons
in
the
corner
and
innumerable
cigarette
boxes
piled
one
upon
another
almost
to
the
ceiling
near
the
icons
was
that
the
writer
of
the
lives
of
the
saints
who
had
lived
in
the
versailles
years
ago
kasimir
stanislavovitch
dark
room
was
terribly
hot
with
a
malignant
and
smelly
dryness
the
light
from
the
window
over
the
door
came
faintly
into
the
darkness
kasimir
stanislavovitch
went
behind
the
screen
took
the
off
his
thin
greasy
hair
threw
his
overcoat
over
the
end
of
his
bare
bed
as
soon
as
he
lay
down
everything
began
to
turn
round
him
to
rush
into
an
abyss
and
he
fell
asleep
instantly
in
his
sleep
all
the
time
he
was
conscious
of
the
smell
of
the
iron
which
stood
close
to
his
face
and
he
dreamt
of
a
spring
day
trees
in
blossom
the
hall
of
a
manor
house
and
a
number
of
people
waiting
anxiously
for
the
bishop
to
arrive
at
any
moment
and
all
night
long
he
was
wearied
and
tormented
with
that
waiting
now
in
the
corridors
of
the
versailles
people
rang
ran
called
to
one
another
behind
the
screen
through
the
double
dusty
the
sun
shone
it
was
almost
hot
kasimir
stanislavovitch
took
off
his
jacket
rang
the
bell
and
began
to
wash
there
came
in
a
boy
the
with
hair
on
his
head
in
a
and
pink
shirt
a
loaf
samovar
and
lemon
kasimir
stanislavovitch
said
without
looking
at
him
and
tea
and
sugar
the
boy
asked
with
moscow
sharpness
and
a
minute
later
he
rushed
in
with
a
boiling
samovar
in
his
hand
held
out
level
with
his
shoulders
on
the
round
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
he
quickly
put
a
tray
with
a
glass
and
a
battered
brass
and
thumped
the
samovar
down
on
the
tray
kasimir
stanislavovitch
while
the
tea
was
drawing
mechanically
opened
the
which
the
had
brought
in
with
the
samovar
his
eye
fell
on
a
report
that
yesterday
an
unknown
man
had
been
picked
up
unconscious
the
victim
was
taken
to
the
hospital
he
read
and
threw
the
paper
away
he
felt
very
bad
and
unsteady
he
got
up
and
opened
the
window
it
faced
the
yard
and
a
breath
of
freshness
and
of
the
city
came
to
him
there
came
to
him
the
melodious
shouts
of
hawkers
the
bells
of
humming
behind
the
house
opposite
the
blended
of
the
cars
the
musical
drone
of
the
city
had
long
since
started
its
huge
noisy
life
in
that
bright
jolly
almost
spring
day
kasimir
stanislavovitch
squeezed
the
lemon
into
a
glass
of
tea
and
greedily
drank
the
sour
muddy
liquid
then
he
again
went
behind
the
screen
the
versailles
was
quiet
it
was
pleasant
and
peaceful
his
eye
wandered
leisurely
over
the
hotel
notice
on
the
wall
a
stay
of
three
hours
is
reckoned
as
a
full
day
a
mouse
scuttled
in
the
chest
of
drawers
rolling
about
a
piece
of
sugar
left
there
by
some
visitor
thus
half
asleep
kasimir
stanislavovitch
lay
for
a
long
time
behind
the
screen
until
the
sun
had
gone
from
the
room
and
another
freshness
was
wafted
in
from
the
window
the
freshness
of
evening
then
he
carefully
got
himself
in
order
he
undid
his
bag
changed
his
underclothing
took
out
a
cheap
but
clean
handkerchief
brushed
his
shiny
and
overcoat
took
out
of
its
torn
pocket
a
crumpled
kiev
newspaper
of
january
and
threw
it
away
into
the
corner
having
dressed
and
combed
his
whiskers
with
a
dyeing
comb
he
counted
his
money
there
remained
in
his
purse
four
roubles
seventy
copecks
and
went
out
exactly
at
six
he
was
outside
a
low
ancient
little
church
in
the
molchanovka
behind
the
church
fence
a
spreading
tree
was
just
breaking
into
green
children
were
playing
there
the
black
stocking
of
one
thin
little
girl
jumping
over
a
rope
was
continually
coming
down
and
he
sat
there
on
a
bench
among
perambulators
with
sleeping
babies
and
nurses
in
russian
costumes
sparrows
prattled
over
all
the
tree
the
air
was
soft
all
but
summer
even
the
dust
smelt
of
summer
the
sky
above
the
sunset
behind
the
houses
melted
into
a
gentle
gold
and
one
felt
that
once
more
there
was
somewhere
in
the
world
joy
youth
happiness
in
the
church
the
chandeliers
were
already
burning
and
there
stood
the
pulpit
and
in
front
of
the
pulpit
was
spread
a
little
carpet
kasimir
stanislavovitch
cautiously
took
off
his
trying
not
to
untidy
his
hair
and
entered
the
church
nervously
he
went
into
a
corner
but
a
corner
from
which
he
could
see
the
couple
to
be
married
he
looked
at
the
painted
vault
raised
his
eyes
to
the
cupola
and
his
every
movement
and
every
gasp
echoed
loudly
through
the
silence
the
church
shone
with
gold
the
candles
sputtered
expectantly
and
now
the
priests
and
choir
began
to
enter
crossing
themselves
with
the
carelessness
which
comes
of
habit
then
old
women
children
smart
wedding
guests
and
worried
stewards
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
porch
the
crunching
wheels
of
the
carriage
and
every
one
turned
their
heads
towards
the
entrance
and
the
hymn
burst
out
come
my
dove
kasimir
stanislavovitch
became
deadly
pale
as
his
heart
beat
and
unconsciously
he
took
a
step
forward
and
close
by
him
there
passed
her
veil
touching
him
and
a
breath
of
she
who
did
not
know
even
of
his
existence
in
the
world
she
passed
bending
her
charming
head
all
flowers
and
transparent
gauze
all
and
innocent
happy
and
timid
like
a
princess
going
to
her
first
communion
kasimir
stanislavovitch
hardly
saw
the
bridegroom
who
came
to
meet
her
a
rather
small
man
with
yellow
hair
during
the
whole
ceremony
only
one
thing
was
before
his
eyes
the
bent
head
in
the
flowers
and
the
veil
and
the
little
hand
trembling
as
it
held
a
burning
candle
tied
with
a
white
ribbon
in
a
bow
about
ten
he
was
back
again
in
the
hotel
all
his
overcoat
smelt
of
the
spring
air
after
coming
out
of
the
church
he
had
seen
near
the
porch
the
car
lined
with
white
satin
and
its
window
reflecting
the
sunset
and
behind
the
window
there
flashed
on
him
for
the
last
time
the
face
of
her
who
was
being
carried
away
from
him
for
ever
after
that
he
had
wandered
about
in
little
streets
and
had
come
out
on
the
novensky
boulevard
now
slowly
and
with
trembling
hands
he
took
off
his
overcoat
put
on
the
table
a
paper
bag
containing
two
green
cucumbers
which
for
some
reason
he
had
bought
at
a
hawker
stall
they
too
smelt
of
spring
even
through
the
paper
and
through
the
upper
pane
of
the
window
the
april
moon
shone
silvery
high
up
in
the
not
yet
darkened
sky
kasimir
stanislavovitch
lit
a
candle
sadly
illuminating
his
empty
casual
home
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
feeling
on
his
face
the
freshness
of
evening
thus
he
sat
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
ring
the
bell
gave
no
orders
locked
himself
in
all
this
seemed
suspicious
to
the
porter
who
had
seen
him
enter
his
room
with
his
shuffling
feet
and
taking
the
key
out
of
the
door
in
order
to
lock
himself
in
from
the
inside
several
times
the
porter
stole
up
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
and
looked
through
the
kasimir
stanislavovitch
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
trembling
and
wiping
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
and
weeping
so
bitterly
so
copiously
that
the
brown
dye
came
off
and
was
smeared
over
his
face
at
night
he
tore
the
cord
off
the
blind
and
seeing
nothing
through
his
tears
began
to
fasten
it
to
the
hook
of
the
but
the
guttering
candle
flickered
and
the
paper
bag
and
terrible
dark
waves
swam
and
flickered
over
the
locked
room
he
was
old
weak
and
he
himself
was
well
aware
of
it
no
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
die
by
his
own
hand
in
the
morning
he
started
for
the
railway
station
about
three
hours
before
the
train
left
at
the
station
he
quietly
walked
about
among
the
passengers
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
and
he
would
stop
unexpectedly
now
before
one
and
now
before
another
and
in
a
low
voice
evenly
but
without
expression
he
would
say
rather
quickly
for
god
sake
i
am
in
a
desperate
position
my
fare
to
briansk
if
only
a
few
copecks
and
some
passengers
trying
not
to
look
at
his
at
the
worn
velvet
collar
of
his
overcoat
at
the
dreadful
face
with
the
faded
violet
whiskers
hurriedly
and
with
confusion
gave
him
something
and
then
rushing
out
of
the
station
on
to
the
platform
he
got
mixed
in
the
crowd
and
disappeared
into
it
while
in
the
versailles
in
the
room
which
for
two
days
had
as
it
were
belonged
to
him
they
carried
out
the
opened
the
windows
to
the
april
sun
and
to
the
fresh
air
noisily
moved
the
furniture
swept
up
and
threw
out
the
dust
and
with
the
dust
there
fell
under
the
table
under
the
table
cloth
which
slid
on
to
the
floor
his
torn
note
which
he
had
forgotten
with
the
cucumbers
i
beg
that
no
one
be
accused
of
my
death
i
was
at
the
wedding
of
my
only
daughter
who
footnote
there
was
no
family
name
the
name
is
polish
not
russian
son
madame
maraud
was
born
and
grew
up
in
lausanne
in
a
strict
honest
industrious
family
she
did
not
marry
young
but
she
married
for
love
in
march
among
the
passengers
on
an
old
french
ship
the
sailing
from
marseilles
to
italy
was
the
newly
married
couple
the
weather
was
calm
and
fresh
the
silvery
mirror
of
the
sea
appeared
and
disappeared
in
the
mists
of
the
spring
horizon
the
newly
married
couple
never
left
the
deck
every
one
liked
them
every
one
looked
at
their
happiness
with
friendly
smiles
his
happiness
showed
itself
in
the
energy
and
keenness
of
his
glance
in
a
need
for
movement
in
the
animation
of
his
welcome
to
those
around
him
hers
showed
itself
in
the
joy
and
interest
with
which
she
took
in
each
detail
the
newly
married
couple
were
the
marauds
he
was
about
ten
years
her
elder
he
was
not
tall
with
a
swarthy
face
and
curly
hair
his
hand
was
dry
and
his
voice
melodious
one
felt
in
her
the
presence
of
some
other
blood
she
was
over
medium
height
although
her
figure
was
charming
and
she
had
dark
hair
and
eyes
after
touching
at
naples
palermo
and
tunis
they
arrived
at
the
algerian
town
of
constantine
where
maraud
had
obtained
a
rather
good
post
and
their
life
in
constantine
for
the
fourteen
years
since
that
happy
spring
gave
them
everything
with
which
people
are
normally
satisfied
wealth
family
happiness
healthy
and
beautiful
children
during
the
fourteen
years
the
marauds
had
greatly
changed
in
appearance
he
became
as
dark
as
an
arab
from
his
work
from
travelling
from
tobacco
and
the
sun
he
had
grown
grey
and
dried
up
many
people
mistook
him
for
a
native
of
algeria
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
recognize
in
her
the
woman
who
sailed
once
in
the
at
that
time
there
was
even
in
the
boots
which
she
put
outside
her
door
at
night
the
charm
of
youth
now
there
was
silver
in
her
hair
her
skin
had
become
more
transparent
and
more
of
a
golden
colour
her
hands
were
thinner
and
in
her
care
of
them
of
her
linen
and
of
her
clothes
she
already
showed
a
certain
excessive
tidiness
their
relations
had
certainly
changed
too
although
no
one
could
say
for
the
worse
they
each
lived
their
own
life
his
time
was
filled
with
work
he
remained
the
same
passionate
and
at
the
same
time
sober
man
that
he
had
been
before
her
time
was
filled
up
with
looking
after
him
and
their
children
two
pretty
girls
of
whom
the
elder
was
almost
a
young
lady
and
every
one
with
one
voice
agreed
that
in
all
constantine
there
was
no
better
hostess
no
better
mother
no
more
charming
companion
in
the
than
madame
maraud
their
house
stood
in
a
quiet
clean
part
of
the
town
from
the
front
rooms
on
the
second
floor
which
were
always
half
dark
with
the
blinds
drawn
down
one
saw
constantine
known
the
world
over
for
its
picturesqueness
on
steep
rocks
stands
the
ancient
arab
fortress
which
has
become
a
french
city
the
windows
of
the
looked
into
a
garden
where
in
perpetual
heat
and
sunshine
slumbered
the
evergreen
eucalyptuses
the
sycamores
and
palms
behind
high
walls
the
master
was
frequently
away
on
business
and
the
lady
led
the
secluded
existence
to
which
the
wives
of
europeans
are
doomed
in
the
colonies
on
sundays
she
always
went
to
church
on
weekdays
she
rarely
went
out
and
she
visited
only
a
small
and
select
circle
she
read
did
talked
or
did
lessons
with
the
children
sometimes
taking
her
younger
daughter
the
marie
on
her
knee
she
would
play
the
piano
with
one
hand
and
sing
old
french
songs
in
order
to
while
away
the
long
african
day
while
the
great
breath
of
hot
wind
blew
in
through
the
open
windows
from
the
garden
constantine
with
all
its
shutters
closed
and
scorched
pitilessly
by
the
sun
seemed
at
such
hours
a
dead
city
only
the
birds
called
behind
the
garden
wall
and
from
the
hills
behind
the
town
came
the
dreary
sound
of
pipes
filled
with
the
melancholy
of
colonial
countries
and
at
times
there
the
dull
thud
of
guns
shook
the
earth
and
you
could
see
the
flashing
of
the
white
helmets
of
soldiers
the
days
in
constantine
passed
monotonously
but
no
one
noticed
that
madame
maraud
minded
that
in
her
pure
refined
nature
there
was
no
trace
of
abnormal
sensitiveness
or
excessive
nervousness
her
health
could
not
be
called
robust
but
it
gave
no
cause
of
anxiety
to
maraud
only
one
incident
once
astonished
him
in
tunis
once
an
arab
juggler
so
quickly
and
completely
hypnotized
her
that
it
was
only
with
difficulty
that
she
could
be
brought
to
but
this
happened
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
from
france
she
had
never
since
experienced
so
sudden
a
loss
of
such
a
morbid
suggestibility
and
maraud
was
happy
untroubled
convinced
that
her
soul
was
tranquil
and
open
to
him
and
it
was
so
even
in
the
last
the
fourteenth
year
of
their
married
life
but
then
there
appeared
in
constantine
emile
emile
the
son
of
madame
bonnay
an
old
and
good
friend
of
maraud
was
only
nineteen
emile
was
the
son
of
her
first
husband
and
had
grown
up
in
paris
where
he
studied
law
but
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
writing
poems
intelligible
only
to
himself
he
was
attached
to
the
school
of
seekers
which
has
now
ceased
to
exist
madame
bonnay
the
widow
of
an
engineer
also
had
a
daughter
elise
in
may
elise
was
just
going
to
be
married
when
she
fell
ill
and
died
a
few
days
before
her
wedding
and
emile
who
had
never
been
in
constantine
came
to
the
funeral
it
can
be
easily
understood
how
that
death
moved
madame
maraud
the
death
of
a
girl
already
trying
on
her
wedding
dress
it
is
also
known
how
quickly
in
such
circumstances
an
intimacy
springs
up
between
people
who
have
hardly
met
before
besides
to
madame
maraud
emile
was
indeed
only
a
boy
soon
after
the
funeral
madame
bonnay
went
for
the
summer
to
stay
with
her
relations
in
france
emile
remained
in
constantine
in
a
suburban
villa
which
belonged
to
his
late
the
villa
hashim
as
it
was
called
in
the
town
and
he
began
coming
nearly
every
day
to
the
marauds
whatever
he
was
whatever
he
pretended
to
be
he
was
still
very
young
very
sensitive
and
he
needed
people
to
whom
he
could
attach
himself
for
a
time
and
is
it
strange
some
said
madame
maraud
has
become
unrecognizable
how
lively
she
has
become
and
how
her
looks
have
improved
however
these
insinuations
were
groundless
at
first
there
was
only
this
that
her
life
had
become
a
little
bit
jollier
and
her
girls
too
had
become
more
playful
and
coquettish
since
emile
every
now
and
then
forgetting
his
sorrow
and
the
poison
with
which
as
he
thought
the
de
had
infected
him
would
for
hours
at
a
time
play
with
marie
and
louise
as
if
he
were
their
age
it
is
true
that
he
was
all
the
same
a
man
a
parisian
and
not
altogether
an
ordinary
man
he
had
already
taken
part
in
that
life
inaccessible
to
ordinary
mortals
which
parisian
writers
live
he
often
read
aloud
with
a
hypnotic
expressiveness
strange
but
sonorous
poems
and
perhaps
it
was
entirely
owing
to
him
that
madame
maraud
walk
had
become
lighter
and
quicker
her
dress
at
home
imperceptibly
smarter
the
tones
of
her
voice
more
tender
and
playful
perhaps
too
there
was
in
her
soul
a
drop
of
purely
feminine
pleasure
that
here
was
a
man
to
whom
she
could
give
her
small
commands
with
whom
she
could
talk
half
seriously
and
half
jokingly
as
a
mentor
with
that
freedom
which
their
difference
in
age
so
naturally
allowed
a
man
who
was
so
devoted
to
her
whole
household
in
which
however
the
first
person
this
of
course
very
soon
became
clear
was
for
him
nevertheless
she
herself
but
how
common
all
that
is
and
the
chief
thing
was
that
often
what
she
really
felt
for
him
was
only
pity
he
honestly
thought
himself
a
born
poet
and
he
wished
outwardly
too
to
look
like
a
poet
his
long
hair
was
brushed
back
with
artistic
modesty
his
hair
was
fine
brown
and
suited
his
pale
face
just
as
did
his
black
clothes
but
the
pallor
was
too
bloodless
with
a
yellow
tinge
in
it
his
eyes
were
always
shining
but
the
tired
look
in
his
face
made
them
seem
feverish
and
so
flat
and
narrow
was
his
chest
so
thin
his
legs
and
hands
that
one
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
when
one
saw
him
get
very
excited
and
run
in
the
street
or
garden
with
his
body
pushed
forward
a
little
as
though
he
were
gliding
in
order
to
hide
his
defect
that
he
had
one
leg
shorter
than
the
other
in
company
he
was
apt
to
be
unpleasant
haughty
trying
to
appear
mysterious
negligent
at
times
elegantly
dashing
at
times
contemptuously
in
everything
independent
but
too
often
he
could
not
carry
it
through
to
the
end
he
became
confused
and
began
to
talk
hurriedly
with
naïve
frankness
and
of
course
he
was
not
very
long
able
to
hide
his
feelings
to
maintain
the
pose
of
not
believing
in
love
or
in
happiness
on
earth
he
had
already
begun
to
bore
his
host
by
his
visits
every
day
he
would
bring
from
his
villa
bouquets
of
the
rarest
flowers
and
he
would
sit
from
morn
to
night
reading
poems
which
were
more
and
more
unintelligible
the
children
often
heard
him
beseeching
some
one
that
they
should
die
together
while
he
spent
his
nights
in
the
native
quarter
in
dens
where
arabs
wrapped
in
dirty
white
robes
greedily
watch
the
de
and
drank
fiery
liqueurs
in
a
word
it
took
less
than
six
weeks
for
his
passion
to
change
into
god
knows
what
his
nerves
gave
way
completely
once
he
sat
for
nearly
the
whole
day
in
silence
then
he
got
up
bowed
took
his
hat
and
went
out
and
half
an
hour
later
he
was
carried
in
from
the
street
in
a
terrible
state
he
was
in
hysterics
and
he
wept
so
passionately
that
he
terrified
the
children
and
servants
but
madame
maraud
it
seemed
did
not
attach
any
particular
importance
to
this
delirium
she
herself
tried
to
help
him
recover
himself
quickly
undid
his
tie
told
him
to
be
a
man
and
she
only
smiled
when
he
without
any
restraint
in
her
husband
presence
caught
her
hands
and
covered
them
with
kisses
and
vowed
devotion
to
her
but
an
end
had
to
be
put
to
all
this
when
a
few
days
after
this
outbreak
emile
whom
the
children
had
greatly
missed
arrived
calm
but
looking
like
some
one
who
has
been
through
a
serious
illness
madame
maraud
gently
told
him
everything
which
is
always
said
on
such
occasions
my
friend
you
are
like
a
son
to
me
she
said
to
him
for
the
first
time
uttering
the
word
son
and
indeed
almost
feeling
a
maternal
affection
do
put
me
in
a
ridiculous
and
painful
position
but
i
swear
to
you
you
are
mistaken
he
exclaimed
with
passionate
sincerity
i
am
only
devoted
to
you
i
only
want
to
see
you
nothing
else
and
suddenly
he
fell
on
his
knees
they
were
in
the
garden
on
a
quiet
hot
dark
evening
impetuously
embraced
her
knees
nearly
fainting
with
passion
and
looking
at
his
hair
at
his
thin
white
neck
she
thought
with
pain
and
ecstasy
ah
yes
yes
i
might
have
had
such
a
son
almost
his
age
however
from
that
time
until
he
left
for
france
he
behaved
reasonably
this
essentially
was
a
bad
sign
for
it
might
mean
that
his
passion
had
become
deeper
but
outwardly
everything
had
changed
for
the
better
only
once
did
he
break
down
it
was
on
a
sunday
after
dinner
at
which
several
strangers
were
present
and
he
careless
of
whether
they
noticed
it
said
to
her
i
beg
you
to
spare
me
a
minute
she
got
up
and
followed
him
into
the
empty
he
went
to
the
window
through
which
the
evening
light
fell
in
broad
shafts
and
looking
straight
into
her
face
said
is
the
day
on
which
my
father
died
i
love
you
she
turned
and
was
about
to
leave
him
frightened
he
hastily
called
after
her
forgive
me
it
is
for
the
first
and
last
time
indeed
she
heard
no
further
confessions
from
him
i
was
fascinated
by
her
agitation
he
noted
that
night
in
his
diary
in
his
elegant
and
pompous
style
i
swore
never
again
to
disturb
her
peace
of
mind
am
i
not
blessed
enough
without
that
he
continued
to
come
to
town
he
only
slept
at
the
villa
hashim
and
he
behaved
erratically
but
always
more
or
less
properly
at
times
he
was
as
before
unnaturally
playful
and
naïve
running
about
with
the
children
in
the
garden
but
more
often
he
sat
with
her
and
sipped
of
her
presence
read
newspapers
and
novels
to
her
and
was
happy
in
her
listening
to
him
the
children
were
not
in
the
way
he
wrote
of
those
days
their
voices
laughter
comings
and
goings
their
very
beings
acted
like
the
subtlest
conductors
for
our
feelings
thanks
to
them
the
charm
of
those
feelings
was
intensified
we
talked
about
the
most
everyday
matters
but
something
else
sounded
through
what
we
said
our
happiness
yes
yes
she
too
was
happy
i
maintain
that
she
loved
me
to
read
poetry
in
the
evenings
from
the
balcony
we
looked
down
upon
constantine
lying
at
our
feet
in
the
bluish
moonlight
at
last
in
august
madame
maraud
insisted
that
he
should
go
away
return
to
his
work
and
during
his
journey
he
wrote
i
going
away
i
am
going
away
poisoned
by
the
bitter
sweet
of
parting
she
gave
me
a
remembrance
a
velvet
ribbon
which
she
wore
round
her
neck
as
a
young
girl
at
the
last
moment
she
blessed
me
and
i
saw
tears
shine
in
her
eyes
when
she
said
my
dear
son
was
he
right
in
thinking
that
madam
maraud
was
also
happy
in
august
no
one
knows
but
that
his
leaving
was
painful
to
her
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
that
word
son
which
had
often
troubled
her
before
now
had
a
sound
for
her
which
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
formerly
when
friends
met
her
on
the
way
to
church
and
said
to
her
jokingly
what
have
you
to
pray
for
madame
maraud
you
are
already
without
sin
and
without
troubles
she
more
than
once
answered
with
a
sad
smile
i
complain
to
god
that
he
has
not
given
me
a
son
now
the
thought
of
a
son
never
left
her
the
thought
of
the
happiness
that
he
would
constantly
give
her
by
his
mere
existence
in
the
world
and
once
soon
after
emile
departure
she
said
to
her
husband
now
i
understand
it
all
i
now
believe
firmly
that
every
mother
ought
to
have
a
son
that
every
mother
who
has
no
son
if
she
look
into
her
own
heart
and
examine
her
whole
life
will
realize
that
she
is
unhappy
you
are
a
man
and
can
not
feel
that
but
it
is
so
oh
how
tenderly
passionately
a
woman
can
love
a
son
she
was
very
affectionate
to
her
husband
during
that
autumn
it
would
happen
sometimes
that
sitting
alone
with
him
she
would
suddenly
say
bashfully
listen
hector
i
am
ashamed
to
mention
it
again
to
you
but
still
do
you
ever
think
of
march
ah
if
we
had
had
a
son
all
this
troubled
me
a
good
deal
maraud
said
later
and
it
troubled
me
the
more
because
she
began
to
get
thin
and
out
of
health
she
grew
feeble
became
more
and
more
silent
and
gentle
she
went
out
to
our
friends
more
and
more
rarely
she
avoided
going
to
town
unless
compelled
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
terrible
incomprehensible
disease
had
been
gradually
getting
hold
of
her
body
and
soul
and
the
governess
added
that
that
autumn
madame
maraud
if
she
went
out
invariably
put
on
a
thick
white
veil
which
she
had
never
done
before
and
that
on
coming
home
she
would
immediately
take
it
off
in
front
of
the
glass
and
would
carefully
examine
her
tired
face
it
is
unnecessary
to
explain
what
had
been
going
on
in
her
soul
during
that
period
but
did
she
desire
to
see
emile
did
he
write
to
her
and
did
she
answer
him
he
produced
before
the
court
two
telegrams
which
he
alleged
she
sent
him
in
reply
to
letters
of
his
one
was
dated
november
you
are
driving
me
mad
be
calm
send
me
a
message
immediately
the
other
of
december
no
no
do
come
i
implore
you
think
of
me
love
me
as
a
mother
but
of
course
the
truth
that
the
telegrams
had
been
sent
by
her
could
not
be
proved
only
this
is
certain
that
from
september
to
january
the
life
which
madame
maraud
lived
was
miserable
agitated
morbid
the
late
autumn
of
that
year
in
constantine
was
cold
and
rainy
then
as
is
always
the
case
in
algeria
there
suddenly
came
a
delightful
spring
and
a
liveliness
began
again
to
return
to
madame
maraud
that
happy
subtle
intoxication
which
people
who
have
already
lived
through
their
youth
feel
at
the
blossoming
of
spring
she
began
to
go
out
again
she
drove
out
a
good
deal
with
the
children
and
used
to
take
them
to
the
deserted
garden
of
the
villa
hashim
she
intended
to
go
to
algiers
and
to
show
the
children
blida
near
which
there
is
in
the
hills
a
wooded
gorge
the
favourite
haunt
of
monkeys
and
so
it
went
on
until
january
of
the
year
on
january
she
woke
up
with
a
feeling
of
gentle
happiness
which
it
seemed
had
agitated
her
the
whole
night
her
husband
was
away
on
business
and
in
his
absence
she
slept
alone
in
the
large
room
the
blinds
and
curtains
made
it
almost
dark
still
from
the
pale
bluishness
which
filtered
in
one
could
see
that
it
was
very
early
and
indeed
the
little
watch
on
the
night
table
showed
that
it
was
six
she
felt
with
delight
the
morning
freshness
coming
from
the
garden
and
wrapping
the
light
blanket
round
her
turned
to
the
wall
why
am
i
so
happy
she
thought
as
she
fell
asleep
and
in
vague
and
beautiful
visions
she
saw
scenes
in
italy
and
sicily
scenes
of
that
spring
when
she
sailed
in
a
cabin
with
its
windows
opening
on
to
the
deck
and
the
cold
silvery
sea
with
doorhangings
which
time
had
worn
and
faded
to
a
rusty
silver
colour
with
its
threshold
of
brass
shining
from
perpetual
polishings
then
she
saw
boundless
bays
lagoons
low
shores
an
arab
city
all
white
with
flat
roofs
and
behind
it
misty
blue
hills
and
mountains
it
was
tunis
where
she
had
only
once
been
that
spring
when
she
was
in
naples
palermo
but
then
as
though
the
chill
of
a
wave
had
passed
over
her
with
a
start
she
opened
her
eyes
it
was
past
eight
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
children
and
the
governess
she
got
up
put
on
a
wrap
and
going
out
on
to
the
balcony
went
down
to
the
garden
and
sat
in
the
it
stood
on
the
sand
by
a
round
table
under
a
blossoming
mimosa
tree
which
made
a
golden
arbour
heavily
scented
in
the
sun
the
maid
brought
her
coffee
she
again
began
to
think
of
tunis
and
she
remembered
the
strange
thing
which
had
happened
to
her
there
the
sweet
terror
and
happy
silence
of
the
moment
before
death
which
she
had
experienced
in
that
city
in
a
warm
pink
twilight
half
lying
in
a
on
the
hotel
roof
faintly
seeing
the
dark
face
of
the
arab
hypnotizer
and
juggler
who
squatted
in
front
of
her
and
sent
her
to
sleep
by
his
hardly
audible
monotonous
melodies
and
the
slow
movements
of
his
thin
hands
and
suddenly
as
she
was
thinking
and
was
looking
mechanically
with
eyes
at
the
bright
silver
spark
which
shone
in
the
sunlight
from
the
spoon
in
the
glass
of
water
she
lost
consciousness
when
with
a
start
she
opened
her
eyes
again
emile
was
standing
over
her
all
that
followed
after
that
unexpected
meeting
is
known
from
the
words
of
emile
himself
from
his
story
from
his
answers
in
yes
i
came
to
constantine
out
of
the
blue
he
said
i
came
because
i
felt
that
the
powers
of
heaven
themselves
could
not
stop
me
in
the
morning
of
january
straight
from
the
railway
station
without
any
warning
i
arrived
at
maraud
house
and
ran
into
the
garden
i
was
overwhelmed
by
what
i
saw
but
no
sooner
had
i
taken
a
step
forward
than
she
woke
up
she
seemed
to
be
amazed
both
by
the
unexpectedness
of
my
appearance
and
by
what
had
been
happening
to
her
but
she
uttered
no
cry
she
looked
at
me
like
a
person
who
has
just
woken
up
from
a
sound
sleep
and
then
she
got
up
arranging
her
hair
it
is
just
what
i
anticipated
she
said
without
expression
you
did
not
obey
me
and
with
a
characteristic
movement
she
folded
the
wrap
round
her
bosom
and
taking
my
head
in
her
two
hands
kissed
me
twice
on
the
forehead
i
was
bewildered
with
passionate
ecstasy
but
she
quietly
pushed
me
from
her
and
said
come
i
am
not
dressed
i
be
back
presently
go
to
the
children
but
for
the
love
of
god
what
was
the
matter
with
you
just
now
i
asked
following
her
on
to
the
balcony
oh
it
was
nothing
a
slight
faintness
i
had
been
looking
at
the
shining
spoon
she
answered
regaining
control
of
herself
and
beginning
to
speak
with
animation
but
what
have
you
done
what
have
you
done
i
could
not
find
the
children
anywhere
it
was
empty
and
quiet
in
the
house
i
sat
in
the
and
heard
her
suddenly
begin
to
sing
in
a
distant
room
in
a
strong
melodious
voice
but
i
did
not
understand
then
the
full
horror
of
that
singing
because
i
was
trembling
with
nervousness
i
had
not
slept
at
all
all
night
i
had
counted
the
minutes
while
the
train
was
hurrying
me
to
constantine
i
jumped
into
the
first
carriage
i
met
raced
out
of
the
station
i
did
not
expect
as
i
came
to
the
town
i
knew
i
too
had
a
foreboding
that
my
coming
would
be
fatal
to
us
but
still
what
i
saw
in
the
garden
that
mystical
meeting
and
that
sudden
change
in
her
attitude
towards
me
i
could
not
expect
that
in
ten
minutes
she
came
down
with
her
hair
dressed
in
a
light
grey
dress
with
a
shade
of
blue
in
it
ah
she
said
while
i
kissed
her
hand
i
forgot
that
is
sunday
the
children
are
at
church
and
i
overslept
after
church
the
children
will
go
to
the
have
you
ever
been
there
and
without
waiting
for
my
answer
she
rang
the
bell
and
told
them
to
bring
me
coffee
she
began
to
look
fixedly
at
me
and
without
listening
to
my
replies
to
ask
me
how
i
lived
and
what
i
was
doing
she
began
to
speak
of
herself
of
how
after
two
or
three
very
bad
months
during
which
she
had
become
terribly
old
those
words
were
uttered
with
an
imperceptible
smile
she
now
felt
so
well
as
young
as
never
before
i
answered
listened
but
a
great
deal
i
did
not
understand
both
of
us
said
meaningless
things
my
hands
grew
cold
at
the
thought
of
another
terrible
and
inevitable
hour
i
do
not
deny
that
i
felt
as
though
i
were
struck
by
lightning
when
she
said
i
have
grown
old
i
suddenly
noticed
that
she
was
right
in
the
thinness
of
her
hands
and
faded
though
youthful
face
in
the
dryness
of
some
of
the
outlines
of
her
figure
i
noticed
the
first
signs
of
that
which
painfully
and
somehow
awkwardly
but
still
more
painfully
makes
one
heart
contract
at
the
sight
of
an
ageing
woman
oh
yes
how
quickly
and
sharply
she
had
changed
i
thought
but
still
she
was
beautiful
i
grew
intoxicated
looking
at
her
i
had
been
accustomed
to
dream
of
her
endlessly
i
had
never
for
an
instant
forgotten
when
in
the
evening
of
july
i
had
embraced
her
knees
for
the
first
time
her
hands
too
trembled
slightly
as
she
arranged
her
hair
and
spoke
and
smiled
and
looked
at
me
and
suddenly
you
will
understand
the
whole
catastrophic
power
of
that
woman
suddenly
that
smile
somehow
became
distorted
and
she
said
with
difficulty
but
yet
firmly
you
must
go
home
you
must
rest
after
your
journey
you
are
not
looking
yourself
your
eyes
are
so
terribly
suffering
your
lips
so
burning
that
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
would
you
like
me
to
come
with
you
to
accompany
you
and
without
waiting
for
my
answer
she
got
up
and
went
to
put
on
her
hat
and
cloak
we
drove
quickly
to
the
villa
hashim
i
stopped
for
a
moment
on
the
terrace
to
pick
some
flowers
she
did
not
wait
for
me
but
opened
the
door
herself
i
had
no
servants
there
was
only
a
watchman
but
he
did
not
see
us
when
i
came
into
the
hall
hot
and
dark
with
its
drawn
blinds
and
gave
her
the
flowers
she
kissed
them
then
putting
one
arm
round
me
she
kissed
me
her
lips
were
dry
from
excitement
but
her
voice
was
clear
but
listen
how
shall
we
have
you
got
anything
she
asked
at
first
i
did
not
understand
her
i
was
so
overwhelmed
by
the
first
kiss
the
first
endearment
and
i
murmured
what
do
you
mean
she
shrank
back
what
she
said
almost
sternly
did
you
imagine
that
i
that
we
can
live
after
this
have
you
anything
to
kill
ourselves
with
i
understood
and
quickly
showed
her
my
revolver
loaded
with
five
cartridges
which
i
always
kept
on
me
she
walked
away
quickly
ahead
of
me
from
one
room
to
the
other
i
followed
her
with
that
numbness
of
the
senses
with
which
a
naked
man
on
a
sultry
day
walks
out
into
the
sea
i
heard
the
rustle
of
her
skirts
at
last
we
were
there
she
threw
off
her
cloak
and
began
to
untie
the
strings
of
her
hat
her
hands
were
still
trembling
and
in
the
i
again
noticed
something
pitiful
and
tired
in
her
face
but
she
died
with
firmness
at
the
last
moment
she
was
transformed
she
kissed
me
and
moving
her
head
back
so
as
to
see
my
face
she
whispered
to
me
such
tender
and
moving
words
that
i
can
not
repeat
them
i
wanted
to
go
out
and
pick
some
flowers
to
strew
on
the
she
would
not
let
me
she
was
in
a
hurry
and
said
no
no
you
must
not
there
are
flowers
here
here
are
your
flowers
and
she
kept
on
repeating
and
see
i
beseech
you
by
all
that
is
sacred
to
you
kill
me
yes
and
then
i
will
kill
myself
i
said
without
for
a
moment
doubting
my
resolution
oh
i
believe
you
i
believe
you
she
answered
already
apparently
a
moment
before
her
death
she
said
very
quietly
and
simply
my
god
this
is
unspeakable
and
again
where
are
the
flowers
you
gave
me
kiss
me
for
the
last
time
she
herself
put
the
revolver
to
her
head
i
wanted
to
do
it
but
she
stopped
me
no
that
is
not
right
let
me
do
it
like
this
my
child
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
me
and
lay
the
flowers
on
my
heart
when
i
fired
she
made
a
slight
movement
with
her
lips
and
i
fired
again
she
lay
quiet
in
her
dead
face
there
was
a
kind
of
bitter
happiness
her
hair
was
loose
the
comb
lay
on
the
floor
i
staggered
to
my
feet
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
myself
but
the
room
despite
the
blinds
was
light
in
the
light
and
stillness
which
suddenly
surrounded
me
i
saw
clearly
her
face
already
pale
and
suddenly
madness
seized
me
i
rushed
to
the
window
undid
and
threw
open
the
shutters
began
shouting
and
firing
into
the
air
the
rest
you
know
in
the
spring
five
years
ago
while
wandering
in
algeria
the
writer
of
these
lines
visited
constantine
there
often
comes
to
him
a
memory
of
the
cold
rainy
and
yet
spring
evenings
which
he
spent
by
the
fire
in
the
of
a
certain
old
and
homely
french
hotel
in
the
heavy
elaborate
were
illustrated
papers
and
in
them
you
could
see
the
faded
photographs
of
madame
maraud
there
were
photographs
taken
of
her
at
different
ages
and
among
them
the
lausanne
portrait
of
her
as
a
girl
her
story
is
told
