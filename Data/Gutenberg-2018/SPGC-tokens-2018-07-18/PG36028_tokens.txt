the
prelude
the
scene
is
the
albrechtstrasse
the
main
artery
of
the
capital
which
runs
from
albrechtsplatz
and
the
old
schloss
to
the
barracks
of
the
fusiliers
of
the
guard
the
time
is
noon
on
an
ordinary
the
season
of
the
year
does
not
matter
the
weather
is
fair
to
moderate
it
is
not
raining
but
the
sky
is
not
clear
it
is
a
uniform
light
grey
uninteresting
and
sombre
and
the
street
lies
in
a
dull
and
sober
light
which
robs
it
of
all
mystery
all
individuality
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
traffic
without
much
noise
and
crowd
corresponding
to
the
not
character
of
the
town
glide
past
a
cab
or
two
rolls
by
along
the
pavement
stroll
a
few
residents
colourless
folk
the
public
people
two
officers
their
hands
in
the
slanting
pockets
of
their
grey
approach
each
other
a
general
and
a
lieutenant
the
general
is
coming
from
the
schloss
the
lieutenant
from
the
direction
of
the
barracks
the
lieutenant
is
quite
young
a
mere
stripling
little
more
than
a
child
he
has
narrow
shoulders
dark
hair
and
the
wide
so
common
in
this
part
of
the
world
blue
rather
eyes
and
a
boyish
face
with
a
kind
but
reserved
expression
the
general
has
hair
is
tall
and
altogether
a
commanding
figure
his
eyebrows
look
like
and
his
moustache
hangs
right
down
over
his
mouth
and
chin
he
walks
with
slow
deliberation
his
sword
rattles
on
the
asphalt
his
plume
flutters
in
the
wind
and
at
every
step
he
takes
the
big
red
lapel
of
his
coat
flaps
slowly
up
and
down
and
so
these
two
draw
near
each
other
can
this
rencontre
lead
to
any
complication
impossible
every
observer
can
foresee
the
course
this
meeting
will
naturally
take
we
have
on
one
side
and
the
other
age
and
youth
authority
and
obedience
years
of
services
and
docile
apprenticeship
a
mighty
hierarchical
gulf
rules
and
prescriptions
separate
the
two
natural
organization
take
thy
course
and
instead
what
happens
instead
the
following
surprising
painful
delightful
and
scene
occurs
the
general
noticing
the
young
lieutenant
approach
alters
his
bearing
in
a
surprising
manner
he
draws
himself
up
yet
at
the
same
time
seems
to
get
smaller
he
tones
down
with
a
jerk
so
to
speak
the
splendour
of
his
appearance
stops
the
clatter
of
his
sword
and
while
his
face
assumes
a
cross
and
embarrassed
expression
he
obviously
can
not
make
up
his
mind
where
to
turn
his
eyes
and
tries
to
conceal
the
fact
by
staring
from
under
his
eyebrows
at
the
asphalt
straight
in
front
of
him
the
young
lieutenant
too
betrays
to
the
careful
observer
some
slight
embarrassment
which
however
strange
to
say
he
seems
to
succeed
better
than
the
general
in
cloaking
with
a
certain
grace
and
the
tension
of
his
mouth
is
relaxed
into
a
smile
at
once
modest
and
genial
and
his
eyes
are
directed
with
a
quiet
and
calm
seemingly
without
an
effort
over
the
shoulder
and
beyond
by
now
they
have
come
within
three
paces
of
each
other
and
instead
of
the
prescribed
salute
the
young
lieutenant
throws
his
head
slightly
back
at
the
same
time
draws
his
right
hand
only
his
right
mark
you
out
of
his
and
makes
with
this
same
right
hand
a
little
encouraging
and
condescending
movement
just
opening
the
fingers
with
palm
upwards
nothing
more
but
the
general
who
has
awaited
this
sign
with
his
arms
to
his
sides
raises
his
hand
to
his
helmet
steps
aside
bows
making
a
as
if
to
leave
the
pavement
free
and
deferentially
greets
the
lieutenant
with
reddening
cheeks
and
honest
modest
eyes
thereupon
the
lieutenant
his
hand
to
his
cap
answers
the
respectful
greeting
of
his
superior
officer
answers
it
with
a
look
of
friendliness
answers
it
and
goes
on
his
way
a
miracle
a
freak
of
fancy
he
goes
on
his
way
people
look
at
him
but
he
looks
at
nobody
looks
straight
ahead
through
the
crowd
with
something
of
the
air
of
a
woman
who
knows
that
she
is
being
looked
at
people
greet
him
he
returns
the
greeting
heartily
and
yet
distantly
he
seems
not
to
walk
very
easily
it
looks
as
if
he
were
not
much
accustomed
to
the
use
of
his
legs
or
as
if
the
general
attention
he
excites
bothers
him
so
irregular
and
hesitating
is
his
gait
indeed
at
times
he
seems
to
limp
a
policeman
springs
to
attention
a
smart
woman
coming
out
of
a
shop
smiles
and
curtseys
people
turn
round
to
look
at
him
nudge
each
other
stare
at
him
and
softly
whisper
his
name
it
is
klaus
heinrich
the
younger
brother
of
albrecht
ii
and
heir
presumptive
to
the
throne
there
he
goes
he
is
still
in
view
known
and
yet
a
stranger
he
moves
among
the
crowd
people
all
around
him
and
yet
as
if
alone
he
goes
on
his
lonely
way
and
carries
on
his
narrow
shoulders
the
burden
of
his
highness
i
the
constriction
artillery
salvos
were
fired
when
the
various
means
of
communication
in
the
capital
spread
the
news
that
the
grand
duchess
dorothea
had
given
birth
to
a
prince
for
the
second
time
at
grimmburg
rounds
resounded
through
the
town
and
surrounding
country
fired
by
the
military
in
the
walls
of
the
citadel
directly
afterwards
the
fire
brigade
also
not
to
be
outdone
fired
with
the
town
but
in
their
firing
there
were
long
pauses
between
each
round
which
caused
much
merriment
among
the
populace
the
grimmburg
looked
down
from
the
top
of
a
woody
hill
on
the
picturesque
little
town
of
the
same
name
which
mirrored
its
grey
sloping
roofs
in
the
river
which
flowed
past
it
it
could
be
reached
from
the
capital
in
half
an
hour
by
a
local
railway
which
paid
no
dividends
there
the
castle
stood
the
proud
creation
of
the
margrave
klaus
grimmbart
the
founder
of
the
reigning
house
in
the
dim
mists
of
history
since
then
several
times
rejuvenated
and
repaired
fitted
with
the
comforts
of
the
changing
times
always
kept
in
a
habitable
state
and
held
in
peculiar
honour
as
the
ancestral
seat
of
the
ruling
house
the
cradle
of
the
dynasty
for
it
was
a
rule
and
tradition
of
the
house
that
all
direct
descendants
of
the
margrave
every
child
of
the
reigning
couple
must
be
born
there
this
tradition
could
not
be
ignored
the
country
had
had
sophisticated
and
unbelieving
sovereigns
who
had
laughed
at
it
and
yet
had
complied
with
it
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
it
was
now
much
too
late
to
break
away
from
it
whether
it
was
reasonable
and
enlightened
or
not
why
without
any
particular
necessity
break
with
an
honoured
custom
which
had
managed
somehow
to
perpetuate
itself
the
people
were
convinced
that
there
was
something
in
it
twice
in
the
course
of
fifteen
generations
had
children
of
reigning
sovereigns
owing
to
some
chance
or
other
first
seen
the
light
in
other
schlosses
each
had
come
to
an
unnatural
and
disgraceful
end
but
all
the
sovereigns
of
the
land
and
their
brothers
and
sisters
from
henry
the
confessor
and
john
the
headstrong
with
their
lovely
and
proud
sisters
down
to
albrecht
the
father
of
the
grand
duke
and
the
grand
duke
himself
johann
albrecht
iii
had
been
brought
into
the
world
in
the
castle
and
there
six
years
before
dorothea
had
given
birth
to
her
firstborn
the
heir
apparent
the
castle
was
also
a
retreat
as
dignified
as
it
was
peaceful
the
coolness
of
its
rooms
the
shady
charms
of
its
surroundings
made
it
preferable
as
a
summer
residence
to
the
stiff
hollerbrunn
the
ascent
from
the
town
up
a
rather
badly
paved
street
between
shabby
cottages
and
a
scrubby
wall
through
massive
gates
to
the
ancient
ruin
at
the
entrance
to
the
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
the
statue
of
klaus
grimmbart
the
founder
was
picturesque
but
tiring
but
a
noble
park
spread
at
the
back
of
the
castle
hill
through
which
easy
paths
led
up
into
the
wooded
and
uplands
offering
ideal
opportunities
for
carriage
drives
and
quiet
strolls
as
for
the
inside
of
the
castle
it
had
been
last
subjected
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
johann
albrecht
iii
to
a
thorough
and
redecoration
at
a
cost
which
had
evoked
much
comment
the
furniture
of
the
had
been
completed
and
renewed
in
a
style
at
once
baronial
and
comfortable
the
escutcheons
in
the
hall
of
justice
had
been
carefully
restored
to
their
original
pattern
the
gilding
of
the
intricate
patterns
on
the
vaulted
ceilings
looked
fresh
and
cheerful
all
the
rooms
had
been
fitted
with
parquet
and
both
the
larger
and
the
smaller
had
been
adorned
with
huge

the
brush

professor
von
lindemann
a
distinguished
academician
representing
scenes
from
the
history
of
the
reigning
house
executed
in
a
clear
and
smooth
style
which
was
far
removed
from
and
quite
unaffected
by
the
restless
tendencies
of
modern
schools
nothing
was
wanting
as
the
old
chimneys
of
the
castle
and
its
stoves
reaching
tier
upon
tier
right
up
to
the
ceiling
were
no
longer
fit
to
use
anthracite
stoves
had
been
installed
in
view
of
the
possibility
of
the
place
being
used
as
a
residence
during
the
winter
but
the
day
of
the
salvos
fell
in
the
best
time
of
the
year
late
spring
early
summer
the
beginning
of
june
soon
after
whitsuntide
johann
albrecht
who
had
been
early
informed
by
telegram
that
the
labour
had
begun
just
before
dawn
reached
grimmburg
station
by
the
bankrupt
local
railway
at
eight
where
he
was
greeted
with
congratulations
by
three
or
four
dignitaries
the
mayor
the
judge
the
rector
and
the
town
physician
he
at
once
drove
to
the
castle
the
grand
duke
was
accompanied
by
minister
of
state
baron
knobelsdorff
and
of
infantry

the
grand
duke
eschrich
was
attending
the
mother
johann
albrecht
had
been
seized
with
the
whim
of
requiring
the
young
local
doctor
a
doctor
sammet
who
was
of
jewish
extraction
into
the
bargain
to
accompany
him
to
the
castle
the
unassuming
and
earnest
man
who
had
as
much
as
he
could
do
and
was
not
in
the
least
expecting
any
such
distinction

quite
delighted
quite
delighted
several
times
over

provoking
some
amusement

brightly
painted
room

floor
through
whose
window
a
fine
view
could
be
obtained
of

and
the
windings
of

was
decorated
with
a
frieze
of
portraits

in

olden
days
of

tied
round

she
kissed

went
back
to

slanting
in

himself
brought

it

standing

wandered
through

hung

leaned
against
the
slender

spread
into

stood
before

windows

looked

over

sat
on
the
stone
benches
which
ran
round

everybody

in

several
had
not

time
to
get
any

some
sought
entertainment
in
a
timid
examination
of

von

a
conversation
earlier
in
the
day
with
the
minister
of
state
baron
knobelsdorff
minister
of
home
affairs
foreign
affairs
and
the
grand
ducal
household
it
was
a
spasmodic
chat
which
began
with
a
discussion
on
art
went
on
to
financial
and
economic
questions
alluded
somewhat
disapprovingly
to
a
high
court
official
and
did
not
leave
even
the
most
exalted
personages
out
of
account
it
began
with
the
two
men
standing
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
behind
their
backs
in
front
of
one
of
the
pictures
in
the
larger
each
of
them
thinking
more
than
he
said
the
finance
minister
said
and
this
what
this
what
happening
your
excellency
is
so
well
informed
merely
superficially
it
is
the
investiture
of
two
grand
princes
of
the
blood
by
their
uncle
the
emperor
as
your
excellency
can
see
the
two
young
men
are
kneeling
and
taking
the
oath
with
great
solemnity
on
the
emperor
sword
fine
extraordinarily
fine
what
colouring
dazzling
what
lovely
golden
hair
the
princes
have
and
the
emperor
exactly
as
he
is
described
in
the
books
yes
that
lindemann
well
deserves
all
the
distinctions
which
have
been
given
him
absolutely
those
which
have
been
given
him
those
he
quite
deserves
von
schröder
a
tall
man
with
a
white
beard
a
pair
of
thin
gold
spectacles
on
his
white
nose
a
belly
protruding
slightly
underneath
his
stomach
and
a
which
lapped
over
the
stiff
collar
of
his
coat
looked
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
picture
somewhat
doubtfully
at
it
under
the
influence
of
a
diffidence
which
seized
him
from
time
to
time
during
conversations
with
the
baron
this
knobelsdorff
this
favourite
and
exalted
functionary
was
so
enigmatical
at
times
his
remarks
his
retorts
had
an
indefinable
tinge
of
irony
about
them
he
was
a
widely
travelled
man
he
had
been
all
over
the
world
he
had
so
much
general
knowledge
and
interests
of
such
a
strange
and
exotic
kind
and
yet
he
was
a
model
of
correctness
herr
von
schröder
could
not
quite
understand
him
however
much
one
agreed
with
him
it
was
impossible
to
feel
that
one
really
understood
him
his
opinions
were
full
of
a
mysterious
reserve
his
judgments
of
a
tolerance
which
left
one
wondering
whether
they
implied
approval
or
contempt
but
the
most
suspicious
thing
about
him
was
his
laugh
a
laugh
of
the
eyes
in
which
the
mouth
took
no
part
a
laugh
which
seemed
to
be
produced
by
the
wrinkles
radiating
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
or
vice
versa
to
have
produced
those
same
wrinkles
in
the
course
of
years
baron
knobelsdorff
was
younger
than
the
finance
minister
he
was
then
in
the
prime
of
life
although
his
moustache
and
hair
smoothly
parted
in
the
middle
were
already
beginning
to
turn
grey
for
the
rest
a
squat
man
obviously
pinched
by
the
collar
of
his
court
dress
he
left
herr
von
schröder
to
his
perplexity
for
a
minute
and
then
went
on
only
perhaps
it
might
be
to
the
interests
of
a
prudent
administration
of
the
privy
purse
if
the
distinguished
professor
had
rested
content
with
stars
and
titles
to
speak
bluntly
what
may
all
these
delightful
works
of
art
have
cost
herr
von
schröder
recovered
his
animation
the
desire
the
hope
of
understanding
the
baron
of
getting
on
to
intimate
and
confidential
terms
with
him
excited
him
just
what
i
was
thinking
said
he
turning
round
to
resume
his
walk
through
the
galleries
your
excellency
has
taken
the
question
out
of
my
mouth
i
wonder
what
this
cost
and
all
the
rest
of
these
for
the
restoration
of
the
castle
six
years
ago
cost
a
million
altogether
at
least
that
a
solid
million
and
that
amount
was
audited
and
approved
by
lord
marshal
von
bühl
zu
bühl
who
is
sitting
yonder
in
a
state
of
comfortable
catalepsy
audited
approved
and
disbursed
by
the
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
count
trümmerhauff
disbursed
or
owing
one
of
the
two
this
total
i
say
debited
to
a
fund
a
fund
in
a
word
the
fund
of
the
grand
ducal
settled
estates
your
excellency
knows
as
well
as
i
what
that
means
no
it
makes
me
run
cold
i
swear
i
am
neither
a
nor
a
hypochondriac
but
it
makes
me
run
cold
when
i
think
of
a
man
with
present
conditions
staring
him
in
the
face
coolly
throwing
a
million
away
on
what
on
a
nothing
a
pretty
whim
on
the
beautification
of
the
family
schloss
in
which
his
babies
have
to
be
born
herr
von
knobelsdorff
laughed
yes
heaven
knows
romance
is
a
luxury
and
a
mighty
expensive
one
too
excellency
i
agree
with
you
of
course
but
consider
after
all
the
whole
trouble
in
the
grand
ducal
finances
is
due
to
this
same
romantic
luxury
the
root
of
the
evil
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
ruling
dynasty
are
farmers
their
capital
consists
in
land
and
soil
their
income
in
agricultural
profits
at
the
present
day
they
have
not
been
able
up
to
the
present
to
make
up
their
minds
to
turn
into
industrialists
and
financiers
they
allow
themselves
with
regrettable
obstinacy
to
be
swayed
by
certain
obsolete
and
idealistic
conceptions
such
as
for
instance
the
conceptions
of
trust
and
dignity
the
royal
property
is
hampered
by
a
trust
entailed
in
fact
advantageous
alienations
are
barred
mortgages
the
raising
of
capital
on
credit
for
commercial
improvements
seem
to
them
improper
the
administration
is
seriously
hindered
in
the
free
exploitation
of
business
opportunities
by
ideas
of
dignity
you
forgive
me
wo
you
telling
you
the
absolute
truth
people
who
pay
so
much
attention
to
propriety
as
these
of
course
can
not
and
will
not
keep
pace
with
the
freer
and
less
hampered
initiative
of
less
obstinate
and
unpractical
business
people
now
then
what
in
comparison
with
this
negative
luxury
does
the
positive
million
signify
which
has
been
sacrificed
to
a
pretty
whim
to
borrow
your
excellency
expression
if
it
only
stopped
there
but
we
have
the
regular
expenses
of
a
fairly
dignified
court
to
meet
there
are
the
schlosses
and
their
parks
to
keep
up
hollerbrunn
monbrillant
jägerpreis
are
there
the
hermitage
delphinenort
the
pheasantry
and
the
others
i
had
forgotten
schloss
zegenhaus
and
the
haderstein
ruins
not
to
mention
the
old
schloss
they
are
not
well
kept
up
but
they
all
cost
money
there
are
the
court
theatre
the
picture
gallery
the
library
to
maintain
there
are
a
hundred
pensions
to
pay
no
legal
compulsion
to
pay
them
but
motives
of
trust
and
dignity
and
look
at
the
princely
way
in
which
the
grand
duke
behaved
at
the
time
of
the
last
floods
but
preaching
you
a
regular
sermon
a
sermon
said
the
minister
of
finance
which
your
excellency
thought
would
shock
me
while
you
really
only
confirmed
my
own
view
dear
baron
here
herr
von
schröder
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
no
longer
room
for
any
misunderstanding
as
to
my
opinion
my
loyal
opinion
between
you
and
me
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
the
sovereign
is
beyond
the
reach
of
reproaches
but
here
we
have
to
do
with
a
default
in
both
senses
of
the
word
a
default
which
i
have
no
hesitation
in
laying
at
the
door
of
count
trümmerhauff
his
predecessors
may
be
pardoned
for
having
concealed
from
their
sovereigns
the
true
state
of
the
court
finances
in
those
days
nothing
else
was
expected
of
them
but
count
trümmerhauff
attitude
now
is
not
pardonable
in
his
position
as
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
he
ought
to
have
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
put
a
brake
on
his
thoughtlessness
to
feel
it
incumbent
on
him
now
to
open
his
royal
highness
eyes
relentlessly
to
the
facts
herr
knobelsdorff
knitted
his
brows
and
laughed
really
said
he
so
your
excellency
is
of
the
opinion
that
that
is
what
the
count
was
appointed
for
i
can
picture
to
myself
the
justifiable
astonishment
of
his
lordship
if
you
lay
before
him
your
view
of
the
position
no
no
your
excellency
need
be
under
no
delusion
that
appointment
was
a
quite
deliberate
expression
of
his
wishes
on
the
part
of
his
royal
highness
which
the
count
must
be
the
first
to
respect
it
expressed
not
only
an
do
know
but
also
an
wo
know
a
man
may
be
an
exclusively
decorative
personality
and
yet
be
acute
enough
to
grasp
this
besides
honestly
we
all
of
us
grasped
it
and
the
only
grain
of
comfort
for
all
of
us
is
this
that
there
is
a
prince
alive
to
whom
it
would
be
more
fatal
to
mention
his
debts
than
to
his
royal
highness
our
prince
has
a
something
about
him
which
would
stop
any
tactless
remarks
of
that
sort
before
they
were
spoken
quite
true
quite
true
said
herr
von
schröder
he
sighed
and
stroked
thoughtfully
the
swansdown
trimming
of
his
hat
the
two
men
were
sitting
half
turned
towards
each
other
on
a
raised
window
seat
in
a
roomy
niche
past
which
a
narrow
stone
corridor
ran
outside
a
kind
of
gallery
through
the
pointed
arches
of
which
peeps
of
the
town
could
be
seen
herr
von
schröder
went
on
you
answer
me
baron
one
would
think
you
were
contradicting
me
and
yet
your
words
show
more
incredulity
and
bitterness
than
my
own
herr
von
knobelsdorff
said
nothing
but
made
a
vague
gesture
of
assent
it
may
be
so
said
the
finance
minister
and
nodded
gloomily
at
his
hat
your
excellency
may
be
quite
right
perhaps
we
are
all
blameworthy
we
and
our
forefathers
too
but
it
ought
to
have
been
stopped
for
consider
baron
ten
years
ago
an
opportunity
offered
itself
of
putting
the
finances
of
the
court
on
a
sound
footing
on
a
better
footing
anyhow
if
you
like
it
was
lost
we
understand
each
other
the
grand
duke
attractive
man
that
he
is
had
it
then
in
his
power
to
clear
things
up
by
a
marriage
which
from
a
sound
point
of
view
might
have
been
called
dazzling
instead
of
that
speaking
not
for
myself
of
course
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
disgust
on
faces
when
they
mentioned
the
amount
of
the
dowry
the
grand
duchess
said
herr
von
knobelsdorff
and
the
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
disappeared
almost
entirely
is
one
of
the
handsomest
women
i
have
ever
seen
that
is
an
answer
one
would
expect
of
your
excellency
it
an
æsthetic
answer
an
answer
which
would
have
held
quite
as
good
if
his
royal
highness
choice
like
his
brother
lambert
had
fallen
on
a
member
of
the
royal
ballet
oh
there
was
no
danger
of
that
the
prince
taste
is
a
fastidious
one
as
he
has
shown
he
has
always
shown
in
his
wants
the
antithesis
to
that
want
of
taste
which
prince
lambert
has
shown
all
his
life
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
everybody
had
given
up
all
hope
of
a
direct
heir
to
the
throne
they
were
resigned
for
better
or
worse
to
prince
lambert
whose
unsuitability
to
be
heir
to
the
throne
we
need
not
discuss
then
a
few
weeks
after
he
had
succeeded
johann
albrecht
met
princess
dorothea
cried
this
one
or
none
and
the
grand
duchy
had
its
sovereign
lady
your
excellency
mentioned
the
thoughtful
looks
which
were
exchanged
when
the
figures
of
the
dowry
were
published
you
did
not
mention
the
jubilation
which
at
the
same
time
prevailed
a
poor
princess
to
be
sure
but
is
beauty
such
beauty
a
power
of
happiness
or
not
never
shall
i
forget
her
entry
her
first
smile
as
it
lighted
on
the
gazing
crowds
won
their
love
your
excellency
must
allow
me
to
profess
once
more
my
belief
in
the
idealism
of
the
people
the
people
want
to
see
their
best
their
highest
their
dream
what
stands
for
their
soul
represented
in
their
princes
not
their
money
bags
there
are
others
to
represent
those
that
just
what
there
are
not
just
what
we
have
not
got
the
more
the
pity
then
the
main
point
is
dorothea
has
presented
us
with
an
heir
apparent
to
whom
may
heaven
grant
some
idea
of
figures
i
agree
at
this
point
the
conversation
between
the
two
ministers
ceased
it
was
broken
off
by
the
announcement
by
von
lichterloh
of
the
happy
issue
of
the
confinement
the
smaller
was
soon
filled
with
officials
one
of
the
great
carved
doors
was
quickly
thrown
open
and
the
appeared
in
the
hall
he
had
a
red
face
blue
soldier
eyes
a
bristling
flaxen
moustache
and
silver
lace
on
his
collar
he
looked
somewhat
excited
like
a
man
who
had
been
released
from
deadly
boredom
and
was
primed
with
good
news
conscious
of
the
unusualness
of
the
occasion
he
boldly
ignored
the
rules
of
decorum
and
etiquette
he
saluted
the
company
gaily
and
spreading
his
elbows
raised
the
hilt
of
his
sword
almost
to
his
breast
crying
beg
leave
to
announce
a
prince
good
said
count
schmettern
delightful
quite
delightful
i
call
that
perfectly
delightful
said
lord
marshal
von
bühl
zu
bühl
in
his
jerky
way
he
had
recovered
consciousness
at
once
the
president
of
the
high
consistory
dom
wislezenus
a
man
who
as
a
son
of
a
general
and
thanks
to
his
personal
distinction
had
attained
to
his
high
dignity
at
a
comparatively
early
age
and
on
whose
black
silk
gown
hung
the
star
of
an
order
folded
his
white
hands
on
his
breast
and
said
in
a
melodious
voice
god
bless
his
grand
ducal
highness
you
forget
captain
said
herr
von
knobelsdorff
laughing
that
in
making
your
announcement
you
are
encroaching
on
my
privileges
and
province
until
i
have
made
the
most
searching
investigations
into
the
state
of
affairs
the
question
whether
it
is
a
prince
or
a
princess
remains
undecided
the
others
laughed
and
herr
von
lichterloh
replied
as
you
wish
your
excellency
then
i
have
the
honour
to
beg
your
excellency
to
assume
this
most
important
charge
this
dialogue
referred
to
the
attributes
of
the
minister
of
state
as
registrar
of
the
grand
ducal
house
in
which
capacity
he
was
required
to
satisfy
himself
with
his
own
eyes
of
the
sex
of
the
princely
offspring
and
to
make
an
official
declaration
on
the
subject
herr
von
knobelsdorff
complied
with
this
formality
in
the
in
which
the
babe
was
bathed
he
stayed
longer
there
however
than
he
had
intended
to
as
he
was
puzzled
and
arrested
by
a
painful
sight
which
at
first
he
mentioned
to
nobody
except
the
midwife
doctor
gnadebusch
showed
him
the
child
and
her
eyes
gleaming
mysteriously
behind
her
thick
spectacles
travelled
between
the
minister
of
state
and
the
little
creature
as
it
groped
about
with
one
only
one
little
hand
as
if
she
was
saying
is
it
all
right
it
was
all
right
herr
von
knobelsdorff
was
satisfied
and
the
wise
woman
wrapped
the
child
up
again
but
even
then
she
continued
to
look
down
at
the
prince
and
then
up
at
the
baron
until
she
had
drawn
his
eyes
to
the
point
to
which
she
wished
to
attract
them
the
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
disappeared
he
knit
his
brows
tried
compared
felt
examined
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
at
last
asked
has
the
grand
duke
yet
seen
it
no
excellency
when
the
grand
duke
sees
it
said
herr
von
knobelsdorff
tell
him
that
he
will
grow
out
of
it
and
to
the
others
on
the
he
reported
a
splendid
prince
but
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
after
him
the
grand
duke
also
made
the
disagreeable
discovery
that
was
unavoidable
and
resulted
for
eschrich
in
a
short
extremely
unpleasant
scene
but
for
the
grimmburg
doctor
sammet
in
an
interview
with
the
grand
duke
which
raised
him
considerably
in
the
latter
estimation
and
was
useful
to
him
in
his
subsequent
career
what
happened
was
briefly
as
follows
after
the
birth
johann
albrecht
had
again
retired
to
the
library
and
then
returned
to
sit
for
some
time
at
the
bedside
with
his
wife
hand
in
his
thereupon
he
went
into
the
where
the
infant
now
lay
in
his
high
richly
gilded
cradle
half
covered
with
a
blue
silk
curtain
and
sat
down
in
an
armchair
by
the
side
of
his
little
son
but
while
he
sat
and
watched
the
sleeping
infant
it
happened
that
he
noticed
what
it
was
hoped
that
he
would
not
notice
yet
he
drew
the
counterpane
back
his
face
clouded
over
and
then
he
did
exactly
what
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
done
before
him
looked
from
doctor
gnadebusch
to
the
nurse
and
back
again
both
of
whom
said
nothing
cast
one
glance
at
the
door
into
the
and
stalked
excitedly
back
into
the
library
here
he
at
once
rang
the
silver
bell
which
stood
on
the
and
said
to
herr
von

who
came
in
very
curtly
and
coldly
i
require
herr
eschrich
when
the
grand
duke
was
angry
with
any
member
of
his
suite
he
was
wont
to
strip
the
culprit
for
the
moment
of
all
his
titles
and
dignities
and
to
leave
him
nothing
but
his
bare
name
the
again
clapped
his
spurs
and
heels
together
and
withdrew
johann
albrecht
strode
once
or
twice
in
a
rage
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
hearing
herr
von
lichterloh
bring
the
person
he
had
summoned
into
the
adopted
an
audience
attitude
at
his
as
he
stood
there
his
head
turned
imperiously
in
his
left
hand
planted
on
his
hip
drawing
back
his
frock
coat
from
his
white
waistcoat
he
exactly
resembled
his
portrait
by
professor
von
lindemann
which
hung
beside
the
big
over
the
mantelpiece
in
the
hall
of
the
twelve
months
in
the
town
schloss
opposite
the
portrait
of
dorothea
and
of
which
countless
engravings
photographs
and
picture
postcards
had
been
published
the
only
difference
was
that
johann
albrecht
in
the
portrait
seemed
to
be
of
heroic
stature
while
he
really
was
scarcely
of
medium
height
his
forehead
was
high
where
his
hair
had
receded
and
from
under
his
grey
eyebrows
his
blue
eyes
looked
out
with
dark
rings
round
them
giving
them
an
expression
of
tired
haughtiness
he
had
the
broad
rather
too
high
which
were
a
characteristic
of
his
people
his
whiskers
and
the
soft
tuft
on
his
chin
were
grey
his
moustache
almost
white
from
the
distended
nostrils
of
his
small
but
nose
two
unusually
deep
furrows
ran
down
to
his
chin
the
ribbon
of
the
family
order
always
showed
in
the
opening
of
his
waistcoat
in
his
buttonhole
the
grand
duke
wore
a
carnation
eschrich
entered
with
a
low
bow
he
had
taken
off
his
his
eyelid
drooped
more
heavily
than
usual
over
his
eye
he
looked
apprehensive
and
uncomfortable
the
grand
duke
his
left
hand
on
his
hip
threw
his
head
back
stretched
out
his
right
hand
and
waved
it
palm
upwards
several
times
up
and
down
impatiently
i
am
awaiting
an
explanation
a
justification
said
he
with
a
voice
trembling
with
irritation
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
answer
my
questions
what
is
the
matter
with
the
child
arm
the
raised
his
hand
a
little
a
feeble
gesture
of
impotence
and
blamelessness
he
said
an
it
please
your
royal
highness
an
unfortunate
occurrence
unfavourable
circumstances
during
the
pregnancy
of
her
royal
highness
that
all
nonsense
the
grand
duke
was
so
much
excited
that
he
did
not
wish
for
any
justification
in
fact
he
would
not
allow
one
i
would
remind
you
sir
that
i
am
beside
myself
unfortunate
occurrence
it
was
your
business
to
take
precautions
against
unfortunate
occurrences
the
stood
with
head
and
sinking
his
voice
to
a
submissive
tone
addressed
the
ground
at
his
feet
i
humbly
beg
to
be
allowed
to
remind
you
that
i
at
least
am
not
alone
responsible
privy
councillor
grasanger
an
authority
on
gynæcology
examined
her
royal
highness
but
nobody
can
be
held
responsible
in
this
case
nobody
really
i
permit
myself
to
make
you
responsible
you
are
answerable
to
me
you
were
in
charge
during
the
pregnancy
you
superintended
the
confinement
i
have
relied
on
the
knowledge
to
be
expected
from
your
rank
i
have
trusted
to
your
experience
i
am
bitterly
disappointed
bitterly
disappointed
all
that
your
skill
can
boast
of
is
that
a
crippled
child
has
been
born
would
your
royal
highness
graciously
weigh
i
have
weighed
i
have
weighed
and
found
wanting
thank
you
eschrich
retired
backwards
bowing
in
the
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
while
his
cheeks
glowed
the
grand
duke
again
fell
to
pacing
the
library
in
his
princely
wrath
unreasonable
misinformed
and
foolish
in
his
loneliness
however
whether
it
was
that
he
wished
to
humiliate
the
still
further
or
that
he
regretted
having
robbed
himself
of
any
explanations
ten
minutes
later
the
unexpected
happened
and
the
grand
duke
sent
herr
von
lichterloh
to
summon
young
doctor
sammet
to
the
library
the
doctor
when
he
received
the
message
again
said
quite
delighted
quite
delighted
and
at
first
changed
colour
a
little
then
composed
himself
admirably
it
is
true
that
he
was
not
a
complete
master
of
the
prescribed
etiquette
and
bowed
too
soon
while
he
was
still
in
the
door
so
that
the
could
not
close
it
behind
him
and
had
to
ask
him
in
a
whisper
to
move
forward
but
afterwards
he
stood
in
an
easy
and
unconstrained
attitude
and
gave
reassuring
answers
although
he
showed
that
he
was
naturally
rather
slow
of
speech
beginning
his
sentences
with
hesitating
noises
and
frequently
interspersing
them
with
a
yes
as
if
to
confirm
what
he
was
saying
he
wore
his
dark
yellow
hair
cut
and
his
moustache
untrimmed
his
chin
and
cheeks
were
and
rather
sore
from
it
he
carried
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
the
gaze
of
his
grey
eyes
told
of
shrewdness
and
practical
goodness
his
nose
which
was
too
broad
at
the
bottom
pointed
to
his
origin
he
wore
a
black
tie
and
his
shiny
boots
were
of
a
country
cut
he
kept
his
elbows
close
to
his
side
with
one
hand
on
his
silver
his
whole
appearance
suggested
candour
and
professional
skill
it
inspired
confidence
the
grand
duke
addressed
him
unusually
graciously
rather
in
the
manner
of
a
teacher
who
has
been
scolding
a
naughty
boy
and
turns
to
another
with
a
sudden
assumption
of
mildness
i
have
sent
for
you
doctor
i
want
information
from
you
about
this
peculiarity
in
the
body
of
the
prince
i
assume
that
it
has
not
escaped
your
notice
i
am
confronted
with
a
riddle
an
extremely
painful
riddle
in
a
word
i
desire
your
opinion
and
the
grand
duke
changing
his
position
ended
with
a
gracious
motion
of
the
hand
which
encouraged
the
doctor
to
speak
sammet
looked
at
him
silently
and
attentively
as
if
waiting
till
the
grand
duke
had
completely
regained
his
princely
composure
then
he
said
yes
we
have
here
to
do
with
a
case
which
is
not
of
very
common
occurrence
but
which
is
well
known
and
familiar
to
us
yes
it
is
actually
a
case
of
atrophy
excuse
me
atrophy
forgive
me
royal
highness
i
mean
stunted
growth
yes
i
see
stunted
growth
stunting
that
it
the
left
hand
is
stunted
but
it
unheard
of
i
can
not
understand
it
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
in
my
family
people
talk
nowadays
about
heredity
again
the
doctor
looked
silently
and
attentively
at
the
lonely
and
domineering
man
to
whom
the
news
had
only
just
penetrated
that
people
were
talking
lately
about
heredity
he
answered
simply
pardon
me
royal
highness
but
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
question
of
heredity
really
you
quite
sure
said
the
grand
duke
rather
mockingly
that
is
one
satisfaction
but
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
what
there
can
be
a
question
of
then
with
pleasure
royal
highness
the
cause
of
the
malformation
is
entirely
a
mechanical
one
it
has
been
caused
through
a
mechanical
constriction
during
the
development
of
the
embryo
we
call
such
malformations
yes
the
grand
duke
listened
with
anxious
disgust
he
obviously
feared
the
effect
of
each
succeeding
word
on
his
sensitiveness
he
kept
his
brows
knit
and
his
mouth
open
the
two
furrows
running
down
to
his
beard
seemed
deeper
than
ever
he
said
but
how
in
the
world
i
am
quite
sure
every
precaution
must
have
been
taken
answered
sammet
can
occur
in
various
ways
but
we
can
say
with
comparative
certainty
that
in
our
case
in
this
case
it
is
the
amnion
which
is
to
blame
i
beg
your
pardon
the
amnion
that
is
one
of
the
foetal
membranes
royal
highness
yes
and
in
certain
circumstances
the
removal
of
this
membrane
from
the
embryo
may
be
retarded
and
proceed
so
slowly
that
threads
and
cords
are
left
stretching
from
one
to
the
other
amniotic
threads
as
we
call
them
yes
these
threads
may
be
dangerous
for
they
can
bind
and
knot
themselves
round
the
whole
of
a
child
limb
they
can
entirely
intercept
for
instance
the
of
a
hand
and
even
amputate
it
yes
great
heavens
amputate
it
so
we
must
be
thankful
that
it
has
not
come
to
an
amputation
of
the
hand
that
might
have
happened
yes
but
all
that
has
happened
is
an
unfastening
resulting
in
an
atrophy
and
that
could
not
be
discovered
foreseen
prevented
no
royal
highness
absolutely
not
it
is
quite
certain
that
no
blame
whatever
attaches
to
anybody
such
constrictions
do
their
work
in
secret
we
are
powerless
against
them
yes
and
the
malformation
is
incurable
the
hand
will
remain
stunted
sammet
hesitated
he
looked
kindly
at
the
grand
duke
it
will
never
be
quite
normal
certainly
not
he
said
cautiously
but
the
stunted
hand
will
grow
a
little
larger
than
it
is
at
present
oh
yes
it
assuredly
will
will
he
be
able
to
use
it
for
instance
to
hold
his
reins
or
to
make
gestures
like
any
one
else
use
it
a
little
perhaps
not
much
and
he
got
his
right
hand
that
all
right
will
it
be
very
obvious
asked
the
grand
duke
and
scanned
sammet
face
earnestly
very
noticeable
will
it
detract
much
from
his
general
appearance
think
you
many
people
answered
sammet
evasively
live
and
work
under
greater
disadvantages
yes
the
grand
duke
turned
away
and
walked
once
up
and
down
the
room
sammet
deferentially
made
way
for
him
and
withdrew
towards
the
door
at
last
the
grand
duke
resumed
his
position
at
the
and
said
i
have
now
heard
what
i
wanted
to
know
doctor
i
thank
you
for
your
report
you
understand
your
business
no
doubt
about
that
why
do
you
live
in
grimmburg
why
do
you
not
practise
in
the
capital
i
am
still
young
royal
highness
and
before
i
devote
myself
to
practising
as
a
specialist
in
the
capital
i
should
like
a
few
years
of
really
varied
practice
of
general
experience
and
research
a
country
town
like
grimmburg
affords
the
best
opportunity
of
that
yes
very
sound
very
admirable
of
you
in
what
do
you
propose
to
specialise
later
on
in
the
diseases
of
children
royal
highness
i
intend
to
be
a
children
doctor
yes
you
are
a
jew
asked
the
grand
duke
throwing
back
his
head
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
yes
royal
highness
ah
will
you
answer
me
one
more
question
have
you
ever
found
your
origin
to
stand
in
your
way
a
drawback
in
your
professional
career
i
ask
as
a
ruler
who
is
especially
concerned
that
the
principle
of
chances
for
all
shall
hold
good
unconditionally
and
privately
not
only
officially
everybody
in
the
grand
duchy
answered
sammet
has
the
right
to
work
but
he
did
not
stop
there
moving
his
elbows
like
a
pair
of
short
wings
in
an
awkward
impassioned
way
he
made
a
few
hesitating
noises
and
then
added
in
a
restrained
but
eager
voice
no
principle
of
equalization
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
remark
will
ever
prevent
the
incidence
in
the
life
of
the
community
of
exceptional
and
abnormal
men
who
are
distinguished
from
the
bourgeois
by
their
nobleness
or
infamy
it
is
the
duty
of
the
individual
not
to
concern
himself
as
to
the
precise
nature
of
the
distinction
between
him
and
the
common
herd
but
to
see
what
is
the
essential
in
that
distinction
and
to
recognize
that
it
imposes
on
him
an
exceptional
obligation
towards
society
a
man
is
at
an
advantage
not
at
a
disadvantage
compared
with
the
regular
and
therefore
complacent
majority
if
he
has
one
motive
more
than
they
to
extraordinary
exertions
yes
yes
repeated
sammet
the
double
affirmative
was
meant
to
confirm
his
answer
good
not
bad
very
remarkable
anyhow
said
the
grand
duke
judicially
he
found
sammet
words
suggestive
though
somewhat
off
the
point
he
dismissed
the
young
man
with
the
words
well
doctor
my
time
is
limited
i
thank
you
this
interview
apart
from
its
painful
occasion
has
much
reassured
me
i
have
the
pleasure
of
bestowing
on
you
the
albrecht
cross
of
the
third
class
with
crown
i
shall
remember
you
thank
you
this
was
what
passed
between
the
grimmburg
doctor
and
the
grand
duke
shortly
after
johann
albrecht
left
the
castle
and
returned
by
special
train
to
the
capital
chiefly
to
show
himself
to
the
rejoicing
populace
but
also
in
order
to
give
several
audiences
in
the
palace
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
return
in
the
evening
to
the
castle
and
take
up
his
residence
there
for
the
next
few
weeks
all
those
present
at
the
confinement
at
grimmburg
who
did
not
belong
to
the
grand
duchess
suite
were
also
accommodated
in
the
special
train
of
the
bankrupt
local
railway
some
of
them
travelling
in
the
own
saloon
but
the
grand
duke
drove
from
the
castle
to
the
station
alone
with
von
knobelsdorff
the
minister
of
state
in
an
open
landau
one
of
the
brown
court
carriages
with
the
little
golden
crown
on
the
door
the
white
feathers
in
the
hats
of
the
chasseurs
in
front
fluttered
in
the
summer
breeze
johann
albrecht
was
grave
and
silent
on
the
journey
he
seemed
to
be
worried
and
morose
and
although
herr
von
knobelsdorff
knew
that
the
grand
duke
even
in
private
disliked
anybody
addressing
him
unasked
and
uninvited
yet
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
break
the
silence
your
royal
highness
he
said
deprecatingly
seems
to
take
so
much
to
heart
the
little
anomaly
which
has
been
discovered
in
the
prince
body
and
yet
one
would
think
that
on
a
day
like
this
the
reasons
for
joy
and
proud
thankfulness
so
far
outweigh
my
dear
knobelsdorff
replied
johann
albrecht
with
some
irritation
and
almost
in
tears
you
must
forgive
my
you
surely
do
not
wish
me
to
be
in
good
spirits
i
can
see
no
reason
for
being
so
the
grand
duchess
is
going
on
well
true
enough
and
the
child
is
a
boy
that
a
blessing
too
but
he
has
come
into
the
world
with
an
atrophy
a
constriction
caused
by
amniotic
threads
nobody
is
to
blame
it
is
a
misfortune
but
misfortunes
for
which
nobody
is
to
blame
are
the
most
terrible
of
all
misfortunes
and
the
sight
of
their
sovereign
ought
to
awaken
in
his
people
other
feelings
than
those
of
sympathy
the
heir
apparent
is
delicate
needs
constant
care
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
survived
that
attack
of
pleurisy
two
years
ago
and
it
will
be
nothing
less
than
a
miracle
if
he
lives
to
attain
his
majority
now
heaven
grants
me
a
second
son
he
seems
strong
but
he
comes
into
the
world
with
only
one
hand
the
other
is
stunted
useless
a
deformity
he
will
have
to
hide
it
what
a
drawback
what
an
impediment
he
will
have
to
brave
it
out
before
the
world
all
his
life
we
must
let
it
gradually
leak
out
so
that
it
may
not
cause
too
much
of
a
shock
on
his
first
appearance
in
public
no
i
can
not
yet
get
over
it
a
prince
with
one
hand
one
hand
said
herr
von
knobelsdorff
did
your
royal
highness
use
that
expression
twice
deliberately
deliberately
you
did
not
then
for
the
prince
has
two
hands
yet
as
one
is
stunted
one
might
if
one
liked
also
describe
him
as
a
prince
with
one
hand
what
then
and
one
must
almost
wish
not
that
your
royal
highness
second
son
but
that
the
heir
to
the
throne
were
the
victim
of
this
small
malformation
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
your
royal
highness
will
laugh
at
me
but
i
am
thinking
of
the
gipsy
woman
the
gipsy
woman
please
go
on
my
dear
baron
of
the
gipsy
woman
forgive
me
who
a
hundred
years
ago
prophesied
the
birth
of
a
prince
to
your
royal
highness
house
a
prince
one
hand
that
is
how
tradition
puts
it
and
attached
to
the
birth
of
that
prince
a
certain
promise
couched
in
peculiar
terms
the
grand
duke
turned
on

stared
without
saying
a
word
at
herr
von
knobelsdorff
at
the
outer
corner
of
whose
eyes
the
radiating
wrinkles
were
playing
then
mighty
entertaining
he
said
and
resumed
his
former
attitude
prophecies
continued
herr
von
knobelsdorff
generally
come
true
to
this
extent
that
circumstances
arise
which
one
can
interpret
if
one
has
a
mind
to
in
their
sense
and
the
broadness
of
the
terms
in
which
every
proper
prophecy
is
couched
makes
this
all
the
more
easy
one
hand
that
is
regular
what
has
actually
happened
is
a
moderate
case
of
atrophy
but
that
much
counts
for
a
good
deal
for
what
is
there
to
prevent
me
what
is
there
to
prevent
the
people
from
assuming
the
whole
by
this
partial
fulfilment
and
declaring
that
the
conditional
part
of
the
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
the
people
will
do
so
if
not
at
once
at
any
rate
if
the
rest
of
the
prophecy
the
actual
promise
is
in
any
way
realised
it
will
put
two
and
two
together
as
it
always
has
done
in
its
wish
to
see
what
is
written
turn
out
true
i
do
see
how
it
is
going
to
come
about
the
prince
is
a
younger
son
he
will
not
come
to
the
throne
the
intentions
of
fate
are
obscure
but
the
prince
is
there
and
so
may
he
bestow
on
us
as
much
as
he
can
the
grand
duke
did
not
answer
secretly
thrilled
by
dreams
of
the
future
of
his
dynasty
well
knobelsdorff
i
will
not
be
angry
with
you
you
want
to
comfort
me
and
you
have
not
done
it
badly
but
i
must
do
what
is
expected
of
me
the
air
resounded
with
the
distant
cheers
of
many
voices
the
people
of
grimmburg
were
crowded
in
black
masses
behind
the
cordon
at
the
station
officials
were
standing
apart
in
front
waiting
for
the
carriages
there
was
the
mayor
raising
his
wiping
his
forehead
with
a
crumpled
handkerchief
and
poring
over
a
paper
whose
contents
he
was
committing
to
memory
johann
albrecht
assumed
the
expression
appropriate
to
listening
to
the
smoothly
worded
address
and
to
answering
concisely
and
graciously
most
excellent
mayor
the
town
was
dressed
with
flags
and
the
bells
were
ringing
in
the
capital
all
the
bells
were
ringing
and
in
the
evening
there
were
illuminations
not
by
formal
request
of
the
authorities
but
spontaneous
the
whole
city
was
a
blaze
of
light
ii
the
country
the
country
measured
eight
thousand
square
kilometres
and
numbered
one
million
inhabitants
a
pretty
quiet
leisurely
country
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
its
forests
rustled
dreamily
its
broad
acres
showed
signs
of
honest
care
its
industries
were
undeveloped
to
the
point
of
indigence
it
possessed
some
a
few
salt
and
that
was
almost
all
a
certain
amount
of
must
also
be
mentioned
but
he
would
be
a
bold
man
who
described
it
as
a
flourishing
industry
the
alkali
springs
which
rose
from
the
ground
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
and
formed

of

the
claims
of
the
city
to
be
considered
a
health
resort
but
while
the
baths
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
had
been
frequented
by
visitors
from
afar
they
had
later
lost
their
repute
and
been
put
in
the
shade
by
other
baths
and
forgotten
the
most
valuable
of
the
springs
that
called
the
ditlinde
spring
which
was
exceptionally
rich
in
lithium
salts
had
been
opened
up
quite
recently
in
the
reign
of
johann
albrecht
iii
and
as
energetic
business
and
advertising
methods
were
not
employed
its
water
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
winning
a
hundred
thousand
bottles
of
it
were
sent
away
in
the
year
rather
less
than
more
and
but
few
strangers
came
to
drink
it
on
the
spot
the
diet
was
the
scene
all
the
year
round
of
speeches
about
the
barely
satisfactory
results
of
the
trade
returns
by
which
was
really
meant
the
entirely
unsatisfactory
results
which
nobody
could
dispute
that
the
local
railways
did
not
cover
their
expenses
and
the
main
lines
did
not
pay
any
dividends
distressing
but
unalterable
and
inveterate
facts
which
the
minister
for
trade
in
luminous
but
monotonous
declarations
explained
by
the
peaceful
commercial
and
industrial
circumstances
of
the
country
as
well
as
by
the
inaccessibility
of
the
home
critics
added
something
about
defective
organization
of
the
state
industrial
administration
but
the
spirit
of
contradiction
and
negation
was
not
strong
in
the
diet
the
prevailing
frame
of
mind
among
the
representatives
of
the
people
was
one
of
dull
and
loyalty
so
the
railway
revenues
did
not
by
any
means
rank
first
among
the
public
revenues
of
a
nature
the
forest
revenues
had
ranked
first
for
years
in
this
land
of
woods
and
plough
the
fall
in
them
their
startling
depreciation
however
sufficient
reasons
there
were
for
it
was
a
much
more
difficult
matter
to
mend
the
people
loved
their
woods
they
were
a
fair
and
compact
type
with
searching
blue
eyes
and
broad
rather
high
a
sensible
and
honest
solid
and
backward
stamp
of
men
they
clung
to
their
forest
with
all
the
strength
of
their
nature
it
lived
in
their
bones
it
was
to
the
artists
which
it
bred
the
source
and
home
of
their
inspirations
and
it
was
quite
properly
the
object
of
popular
gratitude
not
only
in
regard
to
the
gifts
of
soul
and
intellect
of
which
it
was
the
donor
the
poor
gathered
their
firewood
in
the
forest
it
gave
to
them
freely
they
had
it
for
nothing
they
went
stooping
and
gathering
all
kinds
of
berries
and
mushrooms
among
its
trunks
and
earned
a
little
something
by
doing
so
that
was
not
all
the
people
recognized
that
their
forest
had
a
very
distinctly
favourable
influence
on
the
weather
and
the
healthy
condition
of
the
country
they
were
well
aware
that
without
the
lovely
woods
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
the
outside
would
not
attract
foreigners
with
money
to
spend
in
short
this
not
and
people
could
not
help
knowing
that
the
forest
stood
for
the
most
important
asset
the
most
profitable
heritage
of
the
country
and
yet
the
forest
had
been
sinned
against
outraged
for
ages
and
ages
the
grand
ducal
department
of
woods
and
forests
deserved
all
the
reproaches
that
were
laid
against
it
that
department
had
not
political
insight
enough
to
see
that
the
wood
must
be
maintained
and
kept
as
inalienable
common
property
if
it
was
to
be
useful
not
only
to
the
present
generation
but
also
to
those
to
come
and
that
it
would
surely
avenge
itself
if
it
were
exploited
recklessly
and
without
regard
to
the
future
for
the
benefit
of
the
present
that
was
what
happened
and
was
still
happening
in
the
first
place
great
stretches
of
the
floor
of
the
forest
had
been
impoverished
by
reckless
and
excessive
spoliation
of
its
litter
matters
had
repeatedly
gone
so
far
that
not
only
the
most
recent
carpet
of
needles
and
leaves
but
the
greatest
part
of
the
fall
of
years
past
had
been
removed
and
used
in
the
fields
partly
as
litter
partly
as
mould
there
were
many
forests
which
had
been
completely
stripped
of
mould
some
had
been
crippled
by
the
raking
away
of
the
litter
instances
of
this
were
to
be
found
in
the
public
woodlands
as
well
as
in
the
state
woodlands
if
the
woods
had
been
put
to
these
uses
in
order
to
tide
over
a
sudden
agricultural
crisis
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
complain
but
although
there
were
not
wanting
those
who
declared
that
an
agricultural
system
founded
on
the
appropriation
of
was
inexpedient
indeed
dangerous
the
trade
in
litter
went
on
without
any
particular
reason
on
purely
fiscal
grounds
so
it
was
put
that
is
to
say
on
grounds
which
examined
closely
proved
to
be
only
one
ground
and
object
namely
the
making
of
money
for
it
was
money
which
was
wanted
but
to
get
this
money
ceaseless
inroads
were
made
on
the
capital
until
one
fine
day
it
was
realised
with
dismay
that
an
unsuspected
depreciation
in
that
capital
had
ensued
the
people
were
a
peasant
race
and
thought
that
the
way
to
be
was
to
display
a
perverted
artificial
and
improper
zeal
and
to
employ
reckless
business
methods
a
characteristic
instance
was
the
one
word
about
that
loud
complaints
were
heard
principally
in
the
official
medical
annual
that
a
deterioration
was
noticeable
in
the
nourishment
and
consequently
in
the
development
of
the
country
people
what
was
the
reason
the
owners
of
cows
were
bent
on
turning
all
the
at
their
disposal
into
money
the
spread
of
the
dairy
industry
the
development
and
productiveness
of
the
milk
trade
tempted
them
to
disregard
the
claims
of
their
own
establishments
a
milk
diet
became
a
rarity
in
the
country
and
in
its
stead
recourse
was
had
to
unsubstantial
skimmed
milk
inferior
substitutes
vegetable
oils
and
unfortunately
alcoholic
drinks
as
well
the
critics
talked
about
they
even
called
it
physical
and
moral
debilitation
of
the
population
they
brought
the
facts
to
the
notice
of
the
diet
and
the
government
promised
to
give
the
matter
their
earnest
attention
but
it
was
only
too
clear
that
the
government
was
at
bottom
infected
with
the
same
perversity
as
the
mistaken
timber
continued
to
be
cut
to
excess
in
the
state
forests
once
cut
it
was
gone
and
meant
a
continual
shrinkage
of
public
property
the
clearings
might
have
been
necessary
occasionally
when
the
forests
had
been
damaged
in
one
way
or
another
but
often
enough
they
had
been
due
simply
to
the
fiscal
reasons
referred
to
and
instead
of
the
proceeds
of
the
clearings
being
used
for
the
purchase
of
new
tracts
instead
of
the
cleared
tracts
being
replanted
as
quickly
as
possible
instead
in
a
word
of
the
damage
to
the
capital
value
of
the
state
forests
being
balanced
by
an
addition
to
their
capital
value
the
quickly
earned
profits
had
been
devoted
to
the
payment
of
current
expenses
and
the
redemption
of
bonds
of
course
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
reduction
of
the
national
debt
was
only
too
desirable
but
the
critics
expressed
the
opinion
that
that
was
not
the
time
to
devote
extraordinary
revenues
to
the
building
up
of
the
anybody
who
had
no
interest
in
mincing
matters
must
have
described
the
state
finances
as
in
a
hopeless
muddle
the
country
carried
a
debt
of
thirty
million
pounds
it
struggled
along
under
it
with
patience
and
devotion
but
with
secret
groans
for
the
burden
much
too
heavy
in
itself
was
made
trebly
heavy
through
a
rise
in
the
rate
of
interest
and
through
conditions
of
repayment
such
as
are
usually
imposed
on
a
country
whose
credit
is
shaken
whose
exchange
is
low
and
which
has
already
almost
come
to
be
reckoned
as
interesting
in
the
world
of
financiers
the
succession
of
financial
crises
appeared
to
be
the
list
of
failures
seemed
without
beginning
or
end
and
a
maladministration
which
was
made
no
better
by
frequent
changes
in
its
personnel
regarded
borrowing
as
the
only
cure
for
the
creeping
sickness
in
the
state
finances
even
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
von
schröder
whose
probity
and
singleness
of
purpose
were
beyond
all
doubt
had
been
given
a
peerage
by
the
grand
duke
because
he
had
succeeded
in
placing
a
loan
at
a
high
rate
of
interest
in
the
most
difficult
circumstances
his
heart
was
set
on
an
improvement
in
the
credit
of
the
state
but
as
his
resource
was
to
contract
new
debts
while
he
paid
off
the
old
his
policy
proved
to
be
no
better
than
a
but
costly
blind
for
a
simultaneous
sale
and
purchase
of
bonds
meant
a
higher
purchase
than
selling
price
involving
the
loss
of
thousands
of
pounds
it
seemed
as
if
the
country
were
incapable
of
producing
a
man
of
any
adequate
financial
gifts
improper
practices
and
a
policy
of
were
the
fashion
the
budget
was
so
drawn
up
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
between
ordinary
and
extraordinary
state
requirements
ordinary
and
extraordinary
items
were
jumbled
up
together
and
those
responsible
for
the
budgets
deceived
themselves
and
everybody
else
as
to
the
real
state
of
affairs
by
appropriating
loans
which
were
supposed
to
be
raised
for
extraordinary
purposes
to
cover
a
deficit
in
the
ordinary
exchequer
the
holder
of
the
finance
portfolio
at
one
time
was
actually
an
marshal
krippenreuther
who
took
the
helm
towards
the
end
of
johann
albrecht
iii
reign
was
the
minister
who
convinced
like
herr
von
schröder
of
the
necessity
for
a
strenuous
reduction
in
the
debt
induced
the
diet
to
consent
to
a
final
and
extreme
addition
to
the
burden
of
taxation
but
the
country
naturally
poor
as
it
was
was
on
the
verge
of
insolvency
and
all
krippenreuther
got
was
unpopularity
his
policy
really
meant
merely
a
transfer
from
one
hand
to
the
other
a
transfer
which
itself
involved
a
loss
for
the
increase
in
taxation
laid
a
burden
on
the
national
economy
which
pressed
more
heavily
and
more
directly
than
that
which
was
removed
by
the
sinking
of
the
national
debt
where
then
were
help
and
a
remedy
to
be
found
a
miracle
so
it
seemed
was
needed
and
meanwhile
the
sternest
economy
the
people
were
pious
and
loyal
they
loved
their
princes
as
themselves
they
were
permeated
with
the
sublimity
of
the
monarchical
idea
they
saw
in
it
a
reflexion
of
the
deity
but
the
economical
pressure
was
too
painful
too
generally
felt
the
most
ignorant
could
read
in
the
thinned
and
crippled
forests
a
tale
of
woe
the
consequence
was
that
repeated
appeals
had
been
made
in
the
diet
for
a
curtailment
of
the
civil
list
a
cutting
down
of
the
appanages
and
crown
endowments
the
civil
list
amounted
to
thousand
pounds
the
revenues
of
the
crown
demesnes
to
thousand
pounds
that
was
all
and
the
crown
was
in
debt
to
what
extent
was
perhaps
known
to
count
trümmerhauff
the
keeper
of
the
grand
ducal
purse
a
regular
stickler
but
a
man
of
absolutely
no
business
instincts
it
was
not
known
to
johann
albrecht
at
any
rate
he
seemed
not
to
know
it
and
therein
followed
the
example
of
his
forefathers
who
had
rarely
deigned
to
give
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
their
debts
the
people
attitude
of
veneration
was
reflected
in
their
extraordinary
sense
of
their
own
dignity
which
had
sometimes
assumed
fanciful
and
even
extravagant
forms
and
had
found
its
most
obvious
and
most
serious
expression
in
every
period
in
a
tendency
to
extravagance
and
to
a
reckless
ostentation
as
exaggerated
as
the
dignity
it
represented
one
grimmburger
had
been
christened
the
luxurious
in
so
many
words
they
had
almost
all
deserved
the
nickname
so
that
the
state
of
indebtedness
of
the
house
was
an
historical
and
hereditary
state
reaching
back
to
the
times
when
all
loans
were
a
private
concern
of
the
sovereign
and
when
john
the
headstrong
wishing
to
raise
a
loan
pledged
the
liberty
of
the
most
prominent
of
his
subjects
to
do
so
those
times
were
past
and
johann
albrecht
iii
a
grimmburger
in
his
instincts
was
unfortunately
no
longer
in
a
position
to
give
free
rein
to
his
instincts
his
fathers
had
played
ducks
and
drakes
with
the
family
funds
which
were
reduced
to
nothing
or
little
better
than
nothing
they
had
been
spent
on
the
building
of

french
names
and
marble
colonnades
on
parks
with
fountains
on
splendid
operas
and
all
kinds
of
glittering
shows
figures
were
figures
and
much
against
the
inclination
of
the
grand
duke
in
fact
without
his
consent
the
court

gradually
cut
down
the
princess
catherine

sister
of

never

come
in
for
much
attention
there
was
a
coolness
between
him
and
his
relations
who
could
not
forgive
him
his
and
he
hardly
ever
came
to
court
he
lived
in
his
villa
overlooking
the
public
gardens
with
his
wife
an
from
the
court
theatre
who
bore
the
title
of
baroness
von
rohrdorf
after
one
of
the
prince
properties
and
there
he
divided
his
time
between
sport
and
and
struggling
with
his
debts
he
had
dropped
his
dignities
and
lived
just
like
a
private
citizen
and
if
he
was
generally
supposed
to
have
a
struggle
to
make
two
ends
meet
nobody
gave
him
much
sympathy
for
it
but
alterations
had
been
made
in
the
old
castle
itself
reductions
of
expenses
which
were
discussed
in
the
city
and
the
country
and
discussed
usually
in
an
apprehensive
and
regretful
sense
because
the
people
at
bottom
wished
to
see
themselves
represented
with
due
pride
and
magnificence
several
high
posts
at
the
court
had
been
amalgamated
for
economy
sake
and
for
years
past
herr
von
bühl
zu
bühl
had
been
lord
marshal
chief
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
marshal
of
the
household
at
once
there
had
been
many
discharges
in
the
board
of
green
cloth
and
the
servants
hall
among
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
and
grooms
the
master
cooks
and
chief
confectioners
the
court
and
chamber
lackeys
the
establishment
of
the
royal
stable
had
been
reduced
to
the
barest
minimum
and
what
was
the
good
of
it
all
the
grand
duke
contempt
for
money
showed
itself
in
sudden
outbursts
against
the
squeeze
and
while
the
catering
at
the
court
functions
reached
the
extreme
limits
of
permissible
simplicity
while
at
the
supper
at
the
close
of
the
thursday
concerts
in
the
marble
hall
nothing
but
continual
roast
beef
with
sauce
remoulade
and
were
served
on
the
red
velvet
coverings
of
the
tables
while
the
daily
fare
at
the
grand
duke
own
table
was
no
better
than
that
of
an
ordinary
family
he
defiantly
threw
away
a
whole
year
income
on
the
repair
of
the
grimmburg
but
meanwhile
the
rest
of
his
seats
were
falling
to
pieces
herr
von
bühl
simply
had
not
the
means
at
his
disposal
for
their
upkeep
and
yet
it
was
a
pity
in
the
case
of
many
of
them
those
which
lay
at
some
little
distance
from
the
capital
or
right
out
in
the
country
those
luxurious
asylums
cradled
in
natural
beauties
whose
dainty
names
spoke
of
rest
solitude
content
pastime
and
freedom
from
care
or
recalled
a
flower
or
a
jewel
served
as
holiday
resorts
for
the
citizens
and
strangers
and
brought
in
a
certain
amount
in
which
sometimes
not
always
was
devoted
to
their
upkeep
this
was
not
the
case
however
with
those
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
there
was
the
little
schloss
in
the
empire
style
the
hermitage
standing
silent
and
graceful
on
the
edge
of
the
northern
suburbs
but
long
uninhabited
and
deserted
in
the
middle
of
its
park
which
joined
on
to
the
public
gardens
and
looked
out
on
its
little
pond
there
was
schloss
delphinenort
which
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
from
the
other
in
the
northern
part
of
the
public
gardens
themselves
all
of
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
crown
mirrored
its
untidiness
in
a
huge
square
both
were
in
a
sad
state
that
delphinenort
in
particular
that
noble
structure
in
the
early
baroque
style
with
its
stately
its
high
windows
divided
into
little
panes
its
carved
festoons
its
roman
busts
in
the
niches
its
splendid
its
general
magnificence
should
be
abandoned
to
decay
for
ever
as
it
seemed
was
the
sorrow
of
all
lovers
of
architectural
beauty
and
when
one
day
as
the
result
of
unforeseen
really
strange
circumstances
it
was
restored
to
honour
and
youth
among
them
at
any
rate
the
satisfaction
was
general
for
the
rest
delphinenort
could
be
reached
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
from
the
which
lay
a
little
to
the
of
the
city
and
was
connected
with
its
centre
by
a
direct
line
of
trams
the
only
residences
used
by
the
grand
ducal
family
were
schloss
hollerbrunn
the
summer
residence
an
expanse
of
white
buildings
with
chinese
roofs
on
the
farther
side
of
the
chain
of
hills
which
surrounded
the
capital
coolly
and
pleasantly
situated
on
the
river
and
famed
for
the
in
its
park
farther

the
middle
of
the

to
westward
and
lastly
the
town
castle
itself
called
the
old
castle
although
no
new
one
existed
it
was
called
thus
with
no
idea
of
comparison
simply
because
of
its
age
and
the
critics
declared
that
its
redecoration
was
more
a
matter
of
urgency
than
that
of
the
grimmburg
even
the
inner
rooms
which
were
in
daily
use
by
the
family
were
faded
and
cracked
not
to
mention
the
many
uninhabited
and
unused
rooms
in
the
oldest
parts
of
the
building
which
were
all
choked
and
flyblown
for
some
time
past
the
public
had
been
refused
admission
to
them
a
measure
which
was
obviously
due
to
the
shocking
state
of
the
castle
but
people
who
could
get
a
peep
the
tradesmen
and
the
staff
declared
that
there
was
stuffing
peeping
out
of
more
than
one
stiff
imposing
piece
of
furniture
the
castle
and
the
court
church
together
made
up
a
grey
irregular
and
commanding
mass
of
turrets
galleries
and
gateways
half
fortress
half
palace
various
epochs
had
contributed
to
its
erection
and
large
parts
of
it
were
decaying
spoilt
and
ready
to
fall
into
pieces
to
the
west
it
dropped
steeply
down
to
the
city
and
was
connected
with
it
by
battered
steps
clamped
together
with
rusty
iron
bars
but
the
huge
main
gate
guarded
by
lions
couchant
and
surmounted
by
the
pious
haughty
motto
turris
fortissima
nomen
domini
in
almost
illegible
carving
faced
the
albrechtsplatz
it
had
its
sentries
and
sentry
boxes
it
was
the
scene
of
the
changing
of
the
guard
with
drums
and
martial
display
it
was
the
playground
of
all
the
urchins
of
the
town
the
old
castle
had
three
courtyards
in
the
corners
of
which
rose
graceful
and
between
whose
paving
stones
an
unnecessary
amount
of
weeds
was
generally
growing
but
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
courtyards
stood
the
it
had
stood
there
for
ages
in
a
bed
although
there
was
no
other
attempt
at
a
garden
to
be
seen
it
was
just
like
any
other
it
had
a
porter
to
tend
it
it
stood
there
in
snow
rain
and
sunshine
and
in
due
season
it
bore
roses
these
were
exceptionally
fine
roses
nobly
formed
with
velvet
petals
a
pleasure
to
look
at
and
real
masterpieces
of
nature
but
those
roses
had
one
strange
and
dreadful
peculiarity
they
had
no
scent
or
rather
they
had
a
scent
but
for
some
unknown
reason
it
was
not
the
scent
of
roses
but
of
decay
a
slight
but
plainly
perceptible
scent
of
decay
everybody
knew
it
it
was
in
the
and
strangers
visited
the
courtyard
to
convince
themselves
of
it
with
their
own
noses
there
was
also
a
popular
idea
that
it
was
written
somewhere
that
at
some
time
or
other
on
a
day
of
rejoicings
and
public
felicity
the
blossoms
of
the
would
begin
to
give
forth
a
natural
and
lovely
odour
after
all
it
was
only
to
be
expected
that
the
popular
imagination
would
be
exercised
by
the
wonderful
it
was
exercised
in
precisely
the
same
way
by
the
in
the
old
castle
which
was
used
as
a
lumber
room
its
position
was
such
that
it
could
not
be
ignored
not
far
from
the
gala
rooms
and
the
hall
of
the
knights
where
the
court
officers
used
to
assemble
on
court
days
and
thus
in
a
comparatively
modern
part
of
the
building
but
there
was
certainly
something
uncanny
about
it
especially
as
from
time
to
time
noises
and
cries
occurred
there
which
could
not
be
heard
outside
the
room
and
whose
origin
was
unascertainable
people
swore
that
it
came
from
ghosts
and
many
asserted
that
it
was
especially
noticeable
when
important
and
decisive
events
in
the
grand
ducal
family
were
impending
a
more
or
less
gratuitous
rumour
which
deserved
no
more
serious
attention
than
other
national
products
of
an
historical
and
dynastic
frame
of
mind
as
for
instance
a
certain
dark
prophecy
which
had
been
handed
down
for
hundreds
of
years
and
may
be
mentioned
in
this
connexion
it
came
from
an
old
and
was
to
the
effect
that
a
prince
with
one
hand
would
bring
the
greatest
good
fortune
to
the
country
the
old
hag
had
said
he
will
give
to
the
country
with
one
hand
more
than
all
the
rest
could
give
it
with
two
that
is
how
the
prophecy
was
recorded
and
how
it
was
quoted
from
time
to
time
round
the
old
castle
lay
the
capital
consisting
of
the
old
town
and
the
new
town
with
their
public
buildings
monuments
fountains
and
parks
their
streets
and
squares
named
after
princes
artists
deserving
statesmen
and
distinguished
citizens
divided
into
two
very
unequal
halves
by
the
river
which
flowed
in
a
great
loop
round
the
southern
end
of
the
public
garden
and
was
lost
in
the
surrounding
hills
the
city
was
a
university
town
it
possessed
an
academy
which
was
not
in
much
request
and
whose
curricula
were
unpractical
and
rather
the
professor
of
mathematics
privy
councillor
klinghammer
was
the
only
one
of
any
particular
repute
in
the
scientific
world
the
court
theatre
though
poorly
endowed
maintained
a
decent
level
of
performances
there
was
a
little
musical
literary
and
artistic
life
a
certain
number
of
foreigners
came
to
the
capital
wishing
to
share
in
its
life
and
such
intellectual
attractions
as
it
offered
among
them
wealthy
invalids
who
settled
down
in
the
villas
round
the
and
were
held
in
honour
by
the
state
and
the
community
as
doughty
payers
of
taxes
and
now
you
know
what
the
town
was
like
what
the
country
was
like
and
how
matters
stood

he
turned

inside
and
out
dressed
it
in
different
shapes
and
squeezed
it
dry
he
announced
it
in
a
whisper
then
with
the
whole
power
of
his
lungs
and
whereas
delivered
lightly
and
reflectively
at
the
beginning
of
his
discourse
it
seemed
a
thin
almost
unsubstantial
subject
at
the
close
when
he
for
the
last
time
thundered
it
at
the
congregation
it
appeared
richly
orchestrated
heavily
scored
and
pregnant
with
emotion
then
he
passed
on
to
the
actual
baptism
and
carried
it
out
at
full
length
so
that
all
could
see
it
with
due
stress
on
every
detail
this
then
was
the
day
of
the
prince
first
public
appearance
and
that
he
was
the
chief
actor
in
the
drama
was
clearly
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
was
the
last
to
come
on
the
stage
and
that
his
entry
was
distinct
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
company
preceded
by
herr
von
bühl
he
entered
slowly
in
the
arms
of
the
mistress
of
the
robes
baroness
von
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
he
was
asleep
in
his
laces
his
veils
and
his
white
silk
robe
one
of
his
little
hands
happened
to
be
hidden
his
appearance
evoked
unusual
delight
and
emotion
the
cynosure
and
centre
of
attraction
he
lay
quietly
there
bearing
it
all
as
may
be
supposed
patiently
and
unassumingly
it
was
to
his
credit
that
he
did
not
make
any
disturbance
did
not
clutch
or
struggle
but
doubtless
from
innate
trustfulness
quietly
resigned
himself
to
the
state
which
surrounded
him
bore
it
patiently
and
even
at
that
early
date
sank
his
own
emotions
in
it
the
arms
in
which
he
reposed
were
frequently
changed
at
fixed
points
in
the
ceremony
baroness

handed
him
with
a
curtsey
to
his
aunt
catherine
who
with
a
stern
look
on
her
face
was
dressed
in
a
newly
remade
lilac
silk
dress
and
wore
crown
jewels
in
her
hair
she
laid
him
when
the
moment
came
solemnly
in
his
mother
dorothea
arms
who
in
all
her
stately
beauty
with
a
smile
on
her
proud
and
lovely
mouth
held
him
out
a
while
to
be
blessed
and
then
passed
him
on
a
cousin
held
him
for
a
minute
or
two
a
child
of
eleven
or
twelve
years
with
fair
hair
thin
sticks
of
legs
cold
bare
arms
and
a
broad
red
silk
sash
which
stuck
out
in
a
huge
knot
behind
her
white
dress
her
peaked
face
was
anxiously
fixed
on
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
once
the
prince
woke
up
but
the
flickering
flames
of
the
and
a
shaft
of
sunlight
dust
blinded
him
and
made
him
close
his
eyes
again
and
as
there
were
no
thoughts
but
only
soft
unsubstantial
dreams
in
his
head
as
moreover
he
was
feeling
no
pain
at
the
moment
he
at
once
fell
asleep
again
he
received
a
number
of
names
while
he
slept
but
the
chief
names
were
klaus
heinrich
and
he
slept
on
in
his
cot
with
its
gilded
cornice
and
blue
silk
curtains
while
the
royal
family
feasted
in
the
marble
hall
and
the
rest
of
the
guests
in
the
hall
of
the
knights
in
his
honour
the
newspapers
reported
his
first
appearance
they
described
his
looks
and
his
dress
and
emphasized
his
truly
princely
behaviour
couching
the
moving
and
inspiring
account
in
words
which
had
often
done
duty
on
similar
occasions
after
that
the
public
for
a
long
time
heard
little
of
him
and
he
nothing
of
them
he
knew
nothing
as
yet
understood
nothing
as
yet
guessed
nothing
as
to
the
difficulty
danger
and
sternness
of
the
life
prescribed
for
him
nothing
in
his
conduct
suggested
that
he
felt
any
contrast
between
himself
and
the
great
public
his
little
existence
was
an
irresponsible
carefully
supervised
dream
played
on
a
stage
remote
from
the
public
stage
and
this
stage
was
peopled
with
countless
tinted
phantoms
both
stationary
and
active
some
emerging
but
transiently
some
permanently
at
hand
of
the
permanent
ones
the
parents
were
far
in
the
and
not
altogether
distinguishable
they
were
his
parents
that
was
certain
and
they
were
exalted
and
friendly
too
when
they
approached
there
was
a
feeling
as
if
everything
else
slipped
away
to
each
side
and
left
a
respectable
passage
along
which
they
advanced
towards
him
to
show
him
a
moment
tenderness
the
nearest
and
clearest
things
to
him
were
two
women
with
white
caps
and
aprons
two
beings
who
were
obviously
all
goodness
purity
and
who
tended
his
little
body
in
every
way
and
were
much
distressed
when
he
cried
a
close
partner
in
his
life
too
was
albrecht
his
brother
but
he
was
grave
distant
and
much
more
advanced
when
klaus
heinrich
was
two
years
old
another
birth
took
place
in
the
grimmburg
and
a
princess
came
into
the
world
guns
were
allotted
to
her
because
she
was
of
the
female
sex
and
she
was
given
the
name
of
ditlinde
at
the
font
she
was
klaus
heinrich
sister
and
it
was
a
good
thing
for
him
that
she
appeared
she
was
at
first
surprisingly
small
and
weak
but
she
soon
grew
like
him
caught
him
up
and
the
two
became
inseparable
they
shared
each
other
lives
each
other
views
feelings
and
ideas
they
communicated
to
each
other
their
impressions
of
the
world
outside
them
it
was
a
world
they
were
impressions
calculated
to
produce
a
reflective
frame
of
mind
in
winter
they
lived
in
the
old
castle
in
summer
they
lived
in
hollerbrunn
the
summer
schloss
on
the
river
in
the
cool
in
the
scent
of
the
violet
hedges
with
white
statues
between
them
on
the
way
thither
or
if
at
any
other
time
father
or
mother
took
them
with
them
in
one
of
the
brown
carriages
with
the
little
golden
crown
on
the
door
all
the
stopped
cheered
and
took
their
hats
off
for
father
was
prince
and
ruler
of
the
country
consequently
they
themselves
were
prince
and
princess
undoubtedly
in
precisely
the
same
sense
as
were
the
princes
and
princesses
in
the
french
stories
which
their
swiss
governess
told
them
that
was
worth
consideration
it
was
at
any
rate
a
peculiar
occurrence
when
other
children
heard
the
stories
they
necessarily
regarded
the
princes
which
figured
in
them
from
a
great
distance
and
as
solemn
beings
whose
rank
was
a
glorification
of
reality
and
with
whom
to
concern
themselves
was
undoubtedly
a
chastening
of
their
thoughts
and
an
escape
from
the
ordinary
existence
but
klaus
heinrich
and
ditlinde
regarded
the
heroes
of
the
stories
as
their
own
equals
and
fellows
they
breathed
the
same
air
as
them
they
lived
in
a
schloss
like
them
they
stood
on
a
fraternal
footing
with
them
and
were
justified
in
identifying
themselves
with
them
was
it
their
lot
then
to
live
always
and
continually
on
the
height
to
which
others
only
climbed
when
stories
were
being
told
to
them
the
swiss
governess
true
to
her
general
principles
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
deny
it
if
the
children
had
asked
the
question
in
so
many
words
the
swiss
governess
was
the
widow
of
a
calvinistic
minister
and
was
in
charge
of
both
children
each
of
whom
had
two
lady
maids
as
well
she
was
black
and
white
throughout
her
cap
was
white
and
her
dress
black
her
face
was
white
with
white
warts
on
one
cheek
and
her
smooth
hair
had
a
mixed
metallic
sheen
she
was
very
precise
and
easily
put
out
when
things
happened
which
though
quite
without
danger
could
not
be
allowed
she
clasped
her
white
hands
and
turned
her
eyes
up
to
heaven
but
her
quietest
and
severest
mode
of
punishment
for
serious
occasions
was
to
look
sadly
at
the
children
implying
that
they
had
lost
their
on
a
fixed
day
she
began
on
a
hint
from
higher
quarters
to
address
klaus
heinrich
and
ditlinde
as
grand
ducal
highness
and
from
that
day
she
was
more
easily
put
out
than
before
but
albrecht
was
called
royal
highness
aunt
catherine
children
were
members
of
the
family
only
on
the
distaff
side
and
so
were
of
less
importance
but
albrecht
was
crown
prince
and
heir
apparent
so
that
it
was
not
at
all
unfitting
that
he
should
look
so
pale
and
distant
and
keep
so
much
to
his
bed
he
wore
austrian
coats
with
flap
pockets
and
cut
long
behind
his
head
had
a
big
bump
at
the
back
and
narrow
temples
and
he
had
a
long
face
while
still
quite
young
he
had
come
through
a
serious
illness
which
in
the
opinion
of
eschrich
was
the
reason
for
his
heart
having
shifted
over
to
the
right
however
that
might
be
he
had
seen
death
face
to
face
a
fact
which
had
probably
intensified
the
shy
dignity
which
was
natural
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
extremely
standoffish
cold
from
embarrassment
and
proud
from
lack
of
graciousness
he
lisped
a
little
and
then
blushed
at
doing
so
because
he
was
always
criticizing
himself
his
were
a
little
uneven
one
of
his
eyes
had
some
weakness
or
other
so
that
he
used
glasses
for
writing
his
exercises
which
helped
to
make
him
look
old
and
wise
albrecht
tutor
doctor
veit
a
man
with
hanging
moustaches
hollow
cheeks
and
wan
eyes
unnaturally
far
apart
was
always
at
his
left
hand
doctor
veit
was
always
dressed
in
black
and
carried
a
book
dangling
down
his
thigh
with
his
thrust
between
its
leaves
klaus
heinrich
felt
that
albrecht
did
not
care
much
for
him
and
he
saw
that
it
was
not
only
because
of
his
inferiority
in
years
he
himself
was
and
prone
to
tears
that
was
his
nature
he
cried
when
anybody
looked
sadly
at
him
and
when
he
knocked
his
forehead
against
a
corner
of
the
nursery
table
so
that
it
bled
he
howled
from
sympathy
with
his
forehead
but
albrecht
had
faced
death
yet
never
cried
on
any
condition
he
stuck
his
short
rounded
underlip
a
little
forward
and
sucked
it
lightly
against
the
upper
one
that
was
all
he
was
most
superior
the
swiss
governess
referred
in
so
many
words
to
him
in
matters
of
il
as
a
model
he
had
never
allowed
himself
to
converse
with
the
gorgeous
creatures
who
belonged
to
the
court
not
exactly
men
and
human
beings
but
lackeys
as
klaus
heinrich
had
sometimes
done
in
unguarded
moments
for
albrecht
was
not
curious
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
that
of
a
lonely
boy
who
had
no
wish
to
let
the
world
intrude
upon
him
klaus
heinrich
on
the
contrary
chatted
with
the
lackeys
from
that
same
wish
and
from
an
urgent
though
perhaps
dangerous
and
improper
desire
to
feel
some
contact
with
what
lay
outside
the
charmed
circle
but
the
lackeys
young
and
old
at
the
doors
in
the
corridors
and
the
with
their
gaiters
and
brown
coats
on
the
lace
of
which
the
same
little
crown
as
on
the
carriage
doors
was
repeated
again
and
again
they
straightened
their
knees
when
klaus
heinrich
chatted
to
them
laid
their
great
hands
on
the
seams
of
the
thick
velvet
breeches
bent
a
little
forward
towards
him
so
that
the
aiguillettes
dangled
from
their
shoulders
and
returned
various
highly
proper
answers
the
most
important
part
of
which
was
the
address
grand
ducal
highness
and
smiled
as
they
did
so
with
an
expression
of
cautious
sympathy
which
recalled
the
words
of
the
old
song
the
lad
that
is
born
to
be
king
sometimes
when
he
got
the
chance
klaus
heinrich
went
on
voyages
of
discovery
in
uninhabited
parts
of
the
schloss
with
ditlinde
his
sister
when
she
was
old
enough
at
that
time
he
was
having
lessons
from
schulrat
dröge
rector
of
the
city
schools
who
was
chosen
to
be
his
first
tutor
schulrat
dröge
was
a
born
pedagogue
his
with
its
folds
of
dry
skin
and
gold
stoneless
followed
the
line
of
print
when
klaus
heinrich
read
waiting
before
going
on
to
the
next
word
until
the
preceding
one
had
been
read
he
came
in
a
and
white
waistcoat
with
the
ribbon
of
some
inferior
order
in
his
and
in
broad
shiny
boots
with
brown
he
wore
a
pointed
grey
beard
and
bushy
grey
hair
grew
out
of
his
big
broad
ears
his
brown
hair
was
brushed
up
into
points
on
his
temples
and
so
precisely
parted
as
to
show
clearly
his
yellow
dry
scalp
which
was
full
of
holes
like
canvas
but
thin
grey
hair
was
visible
under
the
strong
brown
hair
behind
and
at
the
sides
he
bowed
slightly
to
the
lackeys
who
opened
the
door
for
him
to
the
big
schoolroom
at
whose
table
klaus
heinrich
sat
waiting
for
him
but
to
klaus
heinrich
he
did
not
confine
himself
to
a
superficial
bow
as
he
entered
the
room
but
made
a
pronounced
and
deliberate
bow
before
he
came
up
to
him
and
waited
for
his
exalted
pupil
to
offer
him
his
hand
this
klaus
heinrich
did
and
the
fact
that
he
did
so
twice
not
only
when
he
greeted
him
but
also
when
he
took
his
departure
just
in
the
graceful
and
winning
way
in
which
he
had
seen
his
father
give
his
hand
to
those
who
expected
it
seemed
to
him
far
more
important
and
essential
than
all
the
instruction
which
came
between
the
two
ceremonies
after
schulrat
dröge
had
come
and
gone
any
number
of
times
klaus
heinrich
had
imperceptibly
gained
a
knowledge
of
all
sorts
of
practical
things
to
everybody
surprise
he
was
quite
at
home
in
every
kind
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
and
could
reel
off
to
order
the
names
of
the
towns
in
the
grand
duchy
pretty
well
without
an
omission
but
as
has
been
said
this
was
not
what
was
in
his
opinion
really
necessary
and
essential
for
him
from
time
to
time
when
he
was
inattentive
at
his
lessons
the
schulrat
rebuked
him
with
a
reference
to
his
exalted
calling
your
exalted
calling
requires
you
he
would
say
or
you
owe
it
to
your
exalted
calling
what
was
his
calling
and
how
was
it
exalted
why
did
the
lackeys
smile
as
if
to
say
the
lad
that
is
born
to
be
king
and
why
was
his
governess
so
much
put
out
when
he
let
himself
go
a
little
in
speech
or
action
he
looked
round
him
and
at
times
when
he
looked
steadily
and
long
and
forced
himself
to
probe
the
essence
of
the
phenomena
around
him
a
dim
apprehension
arose
in
him
of
the
aloofness
of
his
position
he
was
standing
in
one
of
the
gala
rooms
the
silver
hall
in
which
as
he
knew
his
father
the
grand
duke
received
solemn
deputations
he
happened
to
have
wandered
into
it
by
himself
and
he
took
stock
of
his
surroundings
it
was
and
cold
his
little
shoes
were
reflected
in
the
yellow
squares
of
the
parquet
which
spread
like
a
sheet
of
ice
before
him
the
ceiling
covered
with
silvered
was
so
high
that
a
long
metal
shaft
was
necessary
to
allow
the
silver
chandelier
with
its
forest
of
tall
white
candles
to
swing
in
the
middle
of
the
great
space
below
the
ceiling
came
in
faded
colours
the
walls
were
edged
with
silver
and
hung
with
white
silk
with
yellow
spots
not
to
mention
a
split
here
and
there
a
sort
of
monumental
baldachin
resting
on
two
strong
silver
columns
and
decorated
in
front
with
a
silver
garland
broken
in
two
places
from
the
top
of
which
looked
down
a
portrait
of
a
deceased
powdered
ancestress
draped
in
imitation
ermine
formed
the
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
were
broad
silvered
upholstered
in
torn
white
silk
on
the
side
walls
opposite
each
other
towered
enormous
mirrors
whose
glass
was
covered
with
blind
spots
and
on
each
side
of
whose
broad
white
marble
ledges
stood
two
candelabra
which
carried
big
white
candles
like
the
sconces
on
the
walls
all
round
and
like
the
four
silver
candlesticks
which
stood
in
the
corners
before
the
high
windows
to
the
right
looking
over
the
albrechtsplatz
whose
outer
ledges
were
covered
with
snow
white
silk
curtains
yellow
spotted
with
silver
cords
and
trimmed
with
lace
fell
in
rich
and
heavy
folds
to
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
under
the
chandelier
a
table
with
a
pedestal
made
like
a
knobby
silver
and
a
top
made
of
eight
triangles
of
opaque
stood
useless
as
there
were
no
chairs
round
it
and
it
could
only
serve
and
be
meant
to
serve
at
the
very
best
as
a
support
for
your
highness
when
the
lackeys
opened
the
doors
and
ushered
in
the
solemn
figures
in
court
dress
who
came
to
present
their
respects
to
you
klaus
heinrich
looked
round
the
hall
and
clearly
saw
that
there
was
nothing
here
which
reminded
him
of
the
realities
which
schulrat
dröge
for
all
his
bows
was
always
impressing
upon
him
here
all
was
sunday
and
solemnity
just
as
in
church
where
also
he
would
have
felt
the
calls
made
on
him
by
his
tutor
out
of
place
everything
here
was
severe
and
empty
show
and
a
formal
symmetry
pointless
and
uncomfortable
whose
functions
were
obviously
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
awe
and
tension
not
of
freedom
and
ease
to
inculcate
an
attitude
of
decorum
and
discreet
towards
an
unnamed
object
and
it
was
cold
in
the
silver
hall
cold
as
in
the
halls
of
the
where
the
children
hearts
froze
stiff
klaus
heinrich
walked
over
the
glassy
floor
and
stood
at
the
table
in
the
middle
he
laid
his
right
hand
lightly
on
the
table
and
placed
the
left
hand
on
his
hip
so
far
behind
that
it
rested
almost
in
the
small
of
his
back
and
was
not
visible
from
in
front
for
it
was
an
ugly
sight
brown
and
wrinkled
and
had
not
kept
pace
with
the
right
in
its
growth
he
stood
resting
on
one
leg
with
the
other
a
little
advanced
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
silver
ornaments
of
the
door
it
was
not
the
place
nor
the
attitude
for
dreaming
and
yet
he
dreamed
he
saw
his
father
and
looked
at
him
as
he
looked
at
the
hall
to
try
to
grasp
his
meaning
he
saw
the
dull
haughtiness
of
his
blue
eyes
the
furrows
which
proudly
and
morosely
ran
from
nostril
down
to
his
beard
and
were
often
deepened
or
accentuated
by
weariness
and
boredom
nobody
dared
to
address
him
or
to
go
freely
up
to
him
and
speak
to
him
unasked
not
even
the
children
it
was
forbidden
it
was
dangerous
he
answered
it
is
true
but
he
answered
distantly
and
coldly
a
look
of
helplessness
of
passed
over
his
face
which
klaus
heinrich
was
quite
able
to
understand
papa
made
a
speech
and
sent
his
petitioners
away
that
is
what
always
happened
he
gave
an
audience
at
the
beginning
of
the
court
ball
and
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
with
which
the
winter
began
he
went
with
mamma
through
the
rooms
and
halls
in
which
the
members
of
the
court
were
gathered
went
through
the
marble
hall
and
the
gala
rooms
through
the
picture
gallery
the
hall
of
the
knights
the
hall
of
the
twelve
months
the
audience
chamber
and
the
went
not
only
in
a
fixed
direction
but
along
a
fixed
path
which
bustling
herr
von
bühl
kept
free
for
him
and
addressed
a
few
words
to
the
assembled
throng
whoever
was
addressed
by
him
bowed
low
left
a
space
of
parquet
between
himself
and
papa
and
answered
soberly
and
with
signs
of
gratification
thereupon
papa
greeted
them
over
the
intervening
space
from
the
stronghold
of
precise
regulations
which
prescribed
the
others
movements
and
warranted
his
own
attitude
greeted
them
smilingly
and
lightly
and
passed
on
smilingly
and
lightly
of
course
of
course
klaus
heinrich
quite
understood
it
the
look
of
helplessness
which
passed
for
one
moment
over
papa
face
when
anybody
was
impetuous
enough
to
address
him
unasked
understood
it
and
shared
his
feeling
of
it
wounded
something
some
soft
virgin
envelope
of
our
existence
which
was
so
essential
to
it
that
we
stood
helpless
when
anybody
roughly
broke
through
it
and
yet
it
was
this
same
something
which
made
our
eyes
so
dull
and
gave
us
those
deep
furrows
of
boredom
klaus
heinrich
stood
and
saw
he
saw
his
mother
and
her
beauty
which
was
famed
and
extolled
far
and
wide
he
saw
her
standing
robe
de
in
front
of
her
great
glass
for
sometimes
on
solemn
occasions
he
was
allowed
to
be
present
when
the
court
hairdresser
and
the
women
put
the
last
touches
to
her
toilette
herr
von
knobelsdorff
also
was
present
when
mamma
put
on
jewels
from
the
crown
regalia
watched
and
noted
down
the
stones
which
she
decided
to
use
with
all
the
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
showing
he
would
make
mamma
laugh
with
his
droll
remarks
so
that
her
soft
cheeks
filled
with
lovely
little
dimples
but
her
laugh
was
full
of
art
and
grace
and
she
looked
in
the
glass
as
she
laughed
as
if
she
were
practising
it
people
said
that
slav
blood
flowed
in
her
veins
and
that
it
was
that
which
gave
the
sweet
radiance
to
her
eyes
and
the
night
of
her
raven
hair
klaus
heinrich
was
like
her
so
he
heard
people
say
in
that
he
too
had
eyes
with
dark
hair
while
albrecht
and
ditlinde
were
fair
just
as
papa
had
been
before
his
hair
turned
grey
but
he
was
far
from
handsome
owing
to
the
breadth
of
his
and
especially
to
his
left
hand
which
mamma
was
always
reminding
him
to
hide
adroitly
in
the
of
his
coat
behind
his
back
or
under
the
breast
of
his
jacket
especially
when
his
affectionate
impulses
prompted
him
to
throw
both
his
arms
round
her
her
look
was
cold
when
she
bade
him
mind
his
hand
he
saw
her
as
she
was
in
the
picture
in
the
marble
hall
in
a
short
silk
dress
with
lace
flounces
and
long
gloves
which
showed
only
a
glimpse
of
her
ivory
arm
under
her
puffed
sleeves
a
diadem
in
the
night
of
her
hair
her
stately
form
erect
a
smile
of
cool
perfection
on
her
strangely
hard
lips
and
behind
her
the
wheel
of
a
peacock
tail
her
face
was
soft
but
its
beauty
made
it
stern
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
her
heart
too
was
stern
and
absorbed
in
her
beauty
she
slept
far
into
the
day
when
a
ball
or
party
was
in
prospect
and
ate
only
yolks
of
eggs
so
as
not
to
overload
herself
then
in
the
evening
she
was
radiant
as
she
walked
on
papa
arm
along
the
prescribed
path
through
the
halls
dignitaries
blushed
when
they
were
addressed
by
her
and
the
reported
that
it
was
not
only
because
of
her
exalted
rank
that
her
royal
highness
had
been
the
queen
of
the
ball
yes
people
felt
happier
for
the
sight
of
her
whether
it
was
at
the
court
or
outside
in
the
streets
or
in
the
afternoon
driving
or
riding
in
the
park
and
their
cheeks
kindled
flowers
and
cheers
met
her
all
hearts
went
out
to
her
and
it
was
clear
that
the
people
in
cheering
her
were
cheering
themselves
and
that
their
glad
cries
meant
that
they
were
cheered
and
elevated
by
the
sight
of
her
but
klaus
heinrich
knew
well
that
mamma
had
spent
long
anxious
hours
on
her
beauty
that
there
was
practice
and
method
in
her
smiles
and
greetings
and
that
her
own
pulse
beat
never
the
quicker
for
anything
or
anyone
did
she
love
anyone
himself
klaus
heinrich
for
instance
for
all
his
likeness
to
her
why
of
course
she
did
when
she
had
time
to
even
when
she
coldly
reminded
him
of
his
hand
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
reserved
any
expression
or
sign
of
her
tender
feelings
for
occasions
when
were
present
who
were
likely
to
be
edified
by
them
klaus
heinrich
and
ditlinde
did
not
often
come
into
contact
with
their
mother
chiefly
because
they
unlike
albrecht
the
heir
apparent
for
some
time
past
did
not
have
their
meals
at
their
parents
table
but
apart
with
the
swiss
governess
and
when
they
were
summoned
to
mamma
boudoir
which
happened
once
a
week
the
interview
consisted
in
a
few
casual
questions
and
polite
answers
giving
no
scope
for
displays
of
feeling
while
its
whole
drift
seemed
to
be
the
proper
way
to
sit
in
an
with
a
teacup
full
of
milk
but
at
the
concerts
which
took
place
in
the
marble
hall
every
other
thursday
under
the
name
of
the
grand
duchess
thursdays
and
were
so
arranged
that
the
court
sat
at
little
tables
while
the
leading
tenor
schramm
from
the
court
theatre
accompanied
by
an
orchestra
sang
so
lustily
that
the
veins
swelled
on
his
bald
temples
at
the
concerts
klaus
heinrich
and
ditlinde
in
their
best
clothes
were
sometimes
allowed
in
the
hall
for
one
song
and
the
succeeding
pause
when
mamma
showed
how
fond
she
was
of
them
showed
it
to
them
and
to
everybody
else
in
so
heartfelt
and
expressive
a
way
that
nobody
could
have
any
doubt
about
it
she
summoned
them
to
the
table
at
which
she
sat
and
told
them
with
a
happy
smile
to
sit
beside
her
laid
their
cheeks
on
her
shoulders
or
bosom
looked
at
them
with
a
soft
soulful
look
in
her
eyes
and
kissed
them
both
on
forehead
and
mouth
then
the
ladies
bent
their
heads
and
their
eyelids
quivered
while
the
men
slowly
nodded
and
bit
their
lips
in
order
in
manly
wise
to
restrain
their
emotions
yes
it
was
beautiful
and
the
children
felt
they
had
their
share
in
the
effect
which
was
greater
than
anything
schramm
the
singer
could
procure
with
his
most
inspired
notes
and
nestled
close
to
mamma
for
klaus
heinrich
at
last
realized
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
things
no
business
of
ours
to
have
a
simple
feeling
and
to
be
made
happy
by
it
but
that
it
was
our
duty
to
make
our
tenderness
visible
to
the
hall
and
to
exhibit
it
that
the
hearts
of
our
guests
might
swell
occasionally
the
people
outside
in
the
town
and
park
also
were
allowed
to
see
that
mamma
loved
us
for
while
albrecht
drove
or
rode
bad
rider
though
he
was
with
the
grand
duke
early
in
the
morning
klaus
heinrich
and
ditlinde
had
from
time
to
time
to
take
turns
at
accompanying
mamma
on
her
drives
which
took
place
in
the
spring
and
autumn
at
the
time
of
the
afternoon
promenade
with
baroness
von
in
attendance
klaus
heinrich
was
a
little
excited
and
feverish
before
these
drives
to
which
unfortunately
no
enjoyment
but
on
the
contrary
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
effort
attached
for
directly
the
open
carriage
came
out
through
the
lions
gate
on
to
the
albrechtsplatz
past
the
grenadiers
at
the
present
there
were
a
lot
of
people
collected
waiting
for
it
men
women
and
children
who
shouted
and
stared
full
of
curiosity
and
that
meant
pulling
oneself
together
sitting
up
erect
smiling
hiding
the
left
hand
and
saluting
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
people
happy
and
so
it
went
on
right
through
the
city
and
the
fields
other
vehicles
were
obliged
to
keep
away
from
ours
the
police
looked
to
that
but
the
stood
on
the
kerb
the
women
curtseyed
the
men
took
off
their
hats
and
looked
with
eyes
full
of
devotion
and
importunate
curiosity
and
this
was
the
impression
klaus
heinrich
got
that
they
all
were
there
just
to
be
there
and
to
stare
while
he
was
there
to
show
himself
and
to
be
stared
at
and
his
was
far
the
harder
part
he
kept
his
left
hand
in
his
and
smiled
as
mamma
wished
him
to
while
he
felt
that
his
cheeks
were
aglow
but
the
reported
that
the
rosy
redness
of
our
little
duke
cheeks
showed
what
a
healthy
boy
he
was
klaus
heinrich
was
thirteen
years
old
when
he
stood
at
the
solitary
table
in
the
middle
of
the
cold
silver
hall
and
tried
to
probe
the
reality
of
things
around
him
and
as
he
scrutinized
the
various
phenomena
the
empty
torn
pride
of
the
room
aimless
and
uncomfortable
the
symmetry
of
the
white
candles
which
seemed
to
express
awe
and
tension
and
discreet
the
passing
shadow
on
his
father
face
when
anybody
addressed
him
unasked
the
cool
and
calculated
beauty
of
his
mother
whose
one
object
was
admiration
the
devoted
and
importunately
curious
gaze
of
the
people
outside
then
a
suspicion
seized
him
a
vague
and
approximate
conception
of
his
situation
but
simultaneously
horror
seized
him
terror
at
such
a
destiny
a
dread
of
his
exalted
calling
so
strong
that
he
turned
round
and
covered
his
eyes
with
both
his
hands
both
the
little
wrinkled
left
one
too
and
sank
down
at
the
lonely
table
and
cried
cried
from
sympathy
with
himself
and
his
heart
till
they
came
and
wrung
their
hands
and
turned
their
eyes
up
to
heaven
and
questioned
him
and
led
him
away
he
gave
out
that
he
had
been
frightened
and
that
was
quite
true
he
had
known
nothing
understood
nothing
suspected
nothing
of
the
difficulty
and
sternness
of
the
life
prescribed
for
him
he
had
been
merry
and
careless
and
had
given
his
guardians
many
a
scare
but
there
was
no
resisting
the
impressions
which
soon
came
thronging
upon
him
and
forcing
him
to
open
his
eyes
to
the
real
state
of
things
in
the
northern
suburbs
not
far
from
the
a
new
road
had
been
opened
people
told
him
that
the
city
council
had
decided
to
call
it
klaus
heinrich
strasse
once
when
driving
out
with
his
mother
and
he
called
at
a
they
wanted
to
buy
something
the
footman
waited
at
the
carriage
door
the
public
gathered
round
the
bustled
about
there
was
nothing
new
in
all
that
but
klaus
heinrich
for
the
first
time
noticed
his
photograph
in
the
shop
window
it
was
hanging
next
those
of
artists
and
great
men
men
with
lofty
brows
with
a
look
of
the
loneliness
of
fame
in
their
eyes
people
were
satisfied
with
him
on
the
whole
he
gained
dignity
with
years
and
under
the
pressure
of
his
exalted
calling
but
the
strange
thing
was
that
his
longing
increased
at
the
same
time
that
roving
inquisitiveness
which
schulrat
dröge
was
not
the
man
to
satisfy
and
which
had
impelled
him
to
chat
with
the
lackeys
he
had
given
up
doing
that
it
did
not
lead
to
anything
they
smiled
at
him
confirming
him
by
that
very
laugh
in
the
suspicion
that
his
world
of
the
symmetrically
marshalled
candles
presented
an
unconscious
antithesis
to
the
world
outside
but
they
were
no
manner
of
help
to
him
he
looked
round
about
him
on
the
expeditions
in
the
walks
he
took
through
the
town
gardens
with
ditlinde
and
the
swiss
governess
followed
by
a
lackey
he
felt
that
if
they
were
all
of
one
mind
to
stare
at
him
while
he
was
all
alone
and
made
conspicuous
just
to
be
stared
at
he
also
had
no
share
in
their
being
and
doing
he
realized
that
they
presumably
were
not
always
as
he
saw
them
when
they
stood
and
greeted
him
with
deferential
looks
that
it
must
be
his
birth
and
upbringing
which
made
their
looks
deferential
and
that
it
was
with
them
as
with
the
children
when
they
heard
about
fairy
princes
and
were
thereby
refined
and
elevated
above
their
selves
but
he
did
not
know
what
they
looked
like
and
were
when
they
were
not
refined
and
elevated
above
their
selves
his
exalted
calling
concealed
this
from
him
and
it
was
a
dangerous
and
improper
wish
to
allow
his
heart
to
be
moved
by
things
which
his
exaltedness
concealed
from
him
and
yet
he
wished
it
he
wished
it
from
a
jealousy
and
that
roving
inquisitiveness
which
sometimes
drove
him
to
undertake
voyages
of
exploration
into
unknown
regions
of
the
old
schloss
with
ditlinde
his
sister
when
the
opportunity
offered
they
called
it
rummaging
and
great
was
the
charm
of
rummaging
for
it
was
difficult
to
acquire
familiarity
with
the
and
structure
of
the
old
schloss
and
every
time
they
penetrated
far
enough
into
the
remoter
parts
they
found
rooms
closets
and
empty
halls
which
they
had
not
yet
trodden
or
strange
ways
to
rooms
but
once
when
thus
wandering
about
they
had
a
rencontre
an
adventure
befell
them
which
made
a
great
impression
on
klaus
heinrich
though
he
did
not
show
it
and
opened
his
eyes
the
opportunity
came
while
the
swiss
governess
was
absent
on
leave
to
attend
the
evening
service
they
had
drunk
their
milk
from
with
the
grand
duchess
accompanied
by
the
two
had
been
dismissed
and
directed
to
go
back
to
their
ordinary
occupations
in
the
nursery
which
lay
not
far
off
it
was
thought
that
they
needed
nobody
to
go
with
them
klaus
heinrich
was
old
enough
to
take
care
of
ditlinde
of
course
he
was
and
in
the
corridor
he
said
yes
ditlinde
we
will
certainly
go
back
to
the
nursery
but
we
need
not
go
you
know
the
shortest
dullest
way
we
rummage
a
bit
first
if
you
go
up
one
step
and
follow
the
corridor
as
far
as
where
the
arches
begin
you
find
a
hall
with
pillars
behind
them
and
if
you
go
out
of
one
of
the
doors
of
the
hall
with
pillars
clamber
up
the
corkscrew
staircase
you
come
to
a
room
with
a
wooden
roof
and
there
are
lots
of
funny
things
lying
about
there
but
i
do
know
what
comes
after
the
room
and
that
what
we
got
to
find
out
so
let
go
yes
let
said
ditlinde
but
not
too
far
klaus
heinrich
and
not
where
it
too
dusty
for
this
dress
shows
everything
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
velvet
trimmed
with
satin
of
the
same
colour
she
had
at
that
time
dimples
in
her
elbows
and
light
golden
hair
that
curled
round
her
ears
like
ram
horns
in
after
years
she
was
pale
and
thin
she
too
had
the
broad
rather
of
her
father
and
nation
but
they
were
not
accentuated
so
that
they
did
not
spoil
the
lines
of
her
face
but
with
klaus
heinrich
they
were
strong
and
emphatic
so
that
they
seemed
somewhat
to
encroach
upon
to
narrow
and
to
lengthen
his
eyes
his
dark
hair
was
smoothly
parted
cut
in
a
careful
rectangle
on
the
temples
and
brushed
straight
back
from
the
forehead
he
wore
an
open
jacket
with
a
waistcoat
buttoning
at
the
throat
and
a
white
collar
in
his
right
hand
he
held
ditlinde
little
hand
but
his
left
arm
hung
down
with
its
brown
wrinkled
and
undeveloped
hand
thin
and
short
from
the
shoulder
he
was
glad
that
he
could
let
it
hang
without
bothering
to
conceal
it
for
there
was
nobody
there
to
stare
and
to
require
to
be
elevated
and
inspired
and
he
himself
might
stare
and
examine
to
his
heart
content
so
they
went
and
rummaged
as
they
liked
quiet
reigned
in
the
corridors
and
they
saw
hardly
a
lackey
in
the
distance
they
climbed
up
a
staircase
and
followed
the
passage
till
they
came
to
the
arches
showing
that
they
were
in
the
part
of
the
schloss
which
dated
from
the
time
of
john
the
headstrong
and
heinrich
the
confessor
as
klaus
heinrich
knew
and
explained
they
came
to
the
hall
of
the
pillars
and
klaus
heinrich
there
whistled
several
notes
close
after
each
other
for
the
first
were
still
sounding
when
the
last
came
and
so
a
clear
chord
rang
under
the
vaulted
ceiling
they
scrambled
groping
and
often
on
hands
and
knees
up
the
stone
winding
staircase
which
opened
behind
one
of
the
heavy
doors
and
reached
the
room
with
the
wooden
ceiling
in
which
there
were
several
strange
objects
there
were
some
broken
muskets
of
clumsy
size
with
thickly
rusted
locks
which
had
been
too
bad
for
the
museum
and
a
discarded
throne
with
torn
red
velvet
cushions
short
and
cupids
hovering
over
the
bearing
a
crown
then
there
was
a
dusty
and
horribly
interesting
thing
which
intrigued
them
much
and
long
if
they
were
not
quite
mistaken
it
was
a
for
they
could
see
the
iron
spike
to
put
the
bacon
on
and
it
was
dreadful
to
think
how
the
must
fall
down
behind
the
great
beast
yes
this
took
time
and
when
they
stood
up
after
examining
the
their
faces
were
hot
and
their
clothes
stiff
with
rust
and
dust
klaus
heinrich
brushed
them
both
down
but
that
did
not
do
much
good
for
his
hands
were
as
filthy
as
his
clothes
and
suddenly
they
saw
that
dusk
had
begun
to
fall
they
must
return
quickly
ditlinde
insisted
anxiously
on
that
it
was
too
late
to
go
any
farther
that
an
awful
pity
said
klaus
heinrich
who
knows
what
else
we
might
have
found
and
when
we
shall
get
another
chance
of
rummaging
ditlinde
but
he
followed
his
sister
and
they
hurried
back
down
the
crossed
the
hall
of
the
pillars
and
came
out
into
the
arcade
intending
to
hurry
home
thus
they
wandered
on
for
a
time
but
klaus
heinrich
shook
his
head
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
not
the
way
he
had
come
they
went
still
farther
but
several
signs
told
them
that
they
had
mistaken
their
direction
this
stone
seat
with
the
was
not
standing
here
before
that
pointed
window
looked
to
the
west
over
the
quarter
of
the
town
and
not
over
the
inner
courtyard
with
the
they
were
going
wrong
it
was
no
use
denying
it
perhaps
they
had
left
the
hall
of
the
pillars
by
a
wrong
exit
anyhow
they
had
absolutely
lost
their
way
they
went
back
a
little
but
their
disquietude
would
not
allow
them
to
go
very
far
back
so
they
turned
right
about
again
and
decided
to
push
on
the
way
they
had
already
come
and
to
trust
to
luck
their
way
lay
through
a
damp
stuffy
atmosphere
and
great
undisturbed
cobwebs
stretched
across
the
corners
they
went
with
heavy
hearts
and
ditlinde
especially
was
full
of
repentance
and
on
the
brink
of
tears
people
would
notice
her
absence
would
look
sadly
at
her
perhaps
even
tell
the
grand
duke
they
would
never
find
the
way
would
be
forgotten
and
die
of
hunger
and
where
there
was
a
klaus
heinrich
there
were
also
rats
klaus
heinrich
comforted
her
they
only
had
to
find
the
place
where
the
armour
and
crossed
standards
hung
from
that
point
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
direction
and
suddenly
they
had
just
passed
a
bend
in
the
winding
passage
suddenly
something
happened
it
startled
them
dreadfully
what
they
had
heard
was
more
than
the
echo
of
their
own
steps
they
were
other
strange
steps
heavier
than
theirs
they
came
towards
them
now
quickly
now
hesitatingly
and
were
accompanied
by
a
snorting
and
grumbling
which
made
their
blood
run
cold
ditlinde
made
as
if
to
run
away
from
fright
but
klaus
heinrich
would
not
let
go
her
hand
and
they
stood
with
starting
eyes
waiting
for
what
was
coming
it
was
a
man
who
was
just
visible
in
the
and
calmly
considered
his
appearance
was
not
horrifying
he
was
squat
in
figure
and
dressed
like
a
veteran
soldier
he
wore
a
of
cut
a
woollen
comforter
round
his
neck
and
a
medal
on
his
breast
he
held
in
one
hand
a
curly
and
in
the
other
the
bone
handle
of
his
clumsily
umbrella
which
he
tapped
on
the
flags
in
time
with
his
steps
his
thin
grey
hair
was
plastered
up
from
one
ear
in
wisps
over
his
skull
he
had
black
eyebrows
and
a
beard
which
grew
like
the
grand
duke
heavy
and
watery
blue
eyes
with
pouches
of
withered
skin
under
them
he
had
the
usual
high
and
the
furrows
of
his
face
were
like
crevasses
when
he
had
come
quite
close
he
seemed
to
recognize
the
children
for
he
placed
himself
against
the
outer
wall
of
the
passage
at
once
fronted
round
and
began
to
make
a
number
of
bows
consisting
of
several
short
forward
jerks
of
his
whole
body
from
the
feet
upwards
while
he
imparted
a
look
of
honesty
to
his
mouth
and
held
his
in
front
of
him
klaus
heinrich
meant
to
pass
him
by
with
a
nod
but
was
surprised
into
halting
for
the
veteran
began
to
speak
i
beg
pardon
he
suddenly
grunted
then
went
on
in
a
more
natural
voice
i
earnestly
beg
your
young
highnesses
pardon
but
would
your
young
highnesses
take
it
amiss
if
i
addressed
to
them
the
request
that
they
would
very
kindly
acquaint
me
with
the
nearest
way
to
the
nearest
exit
it
need
not
actually
be
the
albrechtstor
not
in
the
least
necessary
that
it
should
be
the
albrechtstor
but
any
exit
from
the
schloss
if
i
dare
be
so
free
as
to
address
this
inquiry
to
your
young
highnesses
klaus
heinrich
had
laid
his
left
hand
on
his
hip
right
behind
so
that
it
lay
almost
in
his
back
and
looked
at
the
ground
the
man
had
simply
spoken
to
him
had
engaged
him
directly
and
unavoidably
in
conversation
he
thought
of
his
father
and
knitted
his
brows
he
pondered
feverishly
over
the
question
how
he
ought
to
behave
in
this
and
incorrect
situation
albrecht
would
have
pursed
up
his
mouth
sucked
with
his
short
rounded
lightly
against
the
upper
and
passed
on
in
silence
so
much
was
certain
but
what
was
the
use
of
rummaging
if
at
the
first
serious
adventure
one
intended
to
pass
on
in
dignity
and
dudgeon
and
the
man
was
honest
and
had
nothing
wicked
about
him
that
klaus
heinrich
could
see
when
he
forced
himself
to
raise
his
eyes
he
simply
said
you
come
with
us
that
the
best
way
i
will
willingly
show
you
where
you
must
turn
off
to
get
to
an
exit
and
they
went
on
thanks
said
the
man
ever
so
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
heaven
knows
i
should
never
have
thought
that
i
should
live
to
walk
about
the
old
schloss
one
day
with
your
young
highnesses
but
there
it
is
and
after
all
my
annoyance
for
i
have
been
annoyed
terribly
annoyed
that
true
and
certain
after
all
my
annoyance
i
have
at
any
rate
this
honour
and
this
satisfaction
klaus
heinrich
longed
to
ask
what
might
have
been
the
reason
for
so
much
annoyance
but
the
veteran
went
straight
on
and
tapped
his
umbrella
in
regular
time
on
the
flags
as
he
went
and
i
recognized
your
young
highnesses
at
once
although
it
is
a
bit
dark
here
in
the
passage
for
i
have
seen
you
many
a
time
in
the
carriage
and
was
always
delighted
for
i
myself
have
just
such
a
couple
of
brats
at
home
i
mean
to
say
mine
are
brats
mine
are
and
the
boy
is
called
klaus
heinrich
too
just
like
me
said
klaus
heinrich
overjoyed
what
luck
there
no
luck
about
it
said
the
man
considering
he
was
named
expressly
after
you
for
he
is
a
couple
of
months
younger
than
you
and
there
are
lots
of
children
in
the
town
and
country
who
are
called
that
and
all
of
them
after
you
no
one
can
hardly
call
it
luck
klaus
heinrich
concealed
his
hand
and
remained
silent
yes
recognized
you
at
once
said
the
man
and
i
thought
thank
heaven
thought
i
that
what
i
call
fortune
in
misfortune
and
help
you
out
of
the
trap
into
which
you
have
stuck
your
nose
you
old
blockhead
and
you
good
reason
to
laugh
thought
i
for
there
many
a
one
has
trudged
about
here
and
been
guyed
by
those
popinjays
and
has
got
out
of
it
so
well
popinjays
thought
klaus
heinrich
and
guyed
he
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
a
fear
a
hope
struck
him
he
said
quite
simply
they
they
guyed
you
not
half
said
the
man
i
should
think
they
did
the
ogres
and
no
mistake
but
i
do
mind
telling
your
young
highnesses
young
though
you
are
but
it
do
you
good
to
hear
it
that
these
people
here
are
a
set
of
wasters
a
man
comes
and
delivers
his
work
as
respectfully
as
possible
yes
bless
my
soul
he
cried
suddenly
and
tapped
his
forehead
with
his
hat
i
have
yet
introduced
myself
to
your
young
highnesses
and
told
you
who
i
am
have
i
hinnerke
he
said
hinnerke
royal
pensioner
and
medallist
and
he
pointed
with
the
of
his
great
rough
hand
to
the
medal
on
his
breast
the
fact
is
that
his
royal
highness
your
father
has
been
graciously
pleased
to
order
a
pair
of
boots
from
me
with
spurs
and
made
of
the
best
quality
they
my
speciality
and
i
made
them
myself
and
took
a
lot
of
trouble
about
them
and
they
were
ready
and
ever
so
smart
must
go
yourself
says
i
to
myself
i
have
a
boy
who
delivers
but
i
says
to
myself
must
go
yourself
they
are
for
the
grand
duke
so
i
rig
myself
out
and
take
my
boots
and
go
to
the
schloss
right
say
the
lackeys
down
below
and
want
to
take
them
from
me
say
i
for
i
do
trust
them
it
my
reputation
gets
me
my
orders
and
my
warrant
let
me
tell
your
highnesses
not
because
i
tip
the
lackeys
but
the
fellows
are
spoilt
by
tips
from
the
and
want
to
get
something
out
of
me
for
their
trouble
say
i
for
i
not
a
one
for
bribing
and
underhand
dealings
deliver
them
myself
and
if
i
ca
give
them
to
the
grand
duke
himself
i
give
them
to
valet
prahl
they
looked
daggers
but
they
say
you
must
go
up
there
and
i
go
up
there
there
are
some
more
of
them
up
there
and
they
say
right
and
want
to
take
charge
of
the
boots
but
i
ask
for
prahl
and
stick
to
it
they
say
having
his
tea
but
i
determined
and
say
i
wait
till
he
finished
and
just
as
i
say
it
who
comes
by
in
his
buckled
shoes
but
valet
prahl
and
he
sees
me
and
i
give
him
the
boots
with
a
few
modest
words
and
he
says
right
and
actually
adds
fine
and
nods
and
takes
them
off
now
i
satisfied
for
prahl
he
safe
so
off
i
go
cries
somebody
hinnerke
you
going
wrong
says
i
and
right
about
and
go
off
in
the
other
direction
but
that
was
the
stupidest
thing
i
could
do
for
they
had
sent
me
to
jericho
and
just
where
i
do
want
to
go
i
walk
on
a
bit
and
meet
another
one
and
ask
him
the
way
to
the
albrechtstor
but
he
spots
at
once
what
up
and
says
up
the
stairs
and
then
keep
to
the
left
and
then
down
again
and
you
cut
off
a
large
corner
and
i
believe
he
means
it
kindly
and
do
what
he
says
and
get
more
and
more
muddled
and
altogether
lose
my
bearings
then
i
see
that
it
not
my
fault
but
the
rogues
and
it
strikes
me
that
i
have
heard
that
they
often
play
that
trick
on
court
tradesmen
who
do
tip
them
and
let
them
wander
about
till
they
sweat
and
my
fury
makes
me
blind
and
stupid
and
i
get
to
places
where
not
a
living
soul
and
do
know
where
i
am
and
get
properly
put
about
and
at
last
i
meet
your
young
highnesses
yes
that
how
it
is
with
me
and
my
boots
ended
shoemaker
hinnerke
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
klaus
heinrich
squeezed
ditlinde
hand
his
heart
beat
so
loud
that
he
absolutely
forgot
to
hide
his
left
hand
that
was
it
that
was
a
touch
of
it
an
outline
no
doubt
about
it
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
his
exalted
calling
shielded
him
from
the
sort
of
thing
people
did
when
they
were
in
the
ordinary
frame
of
mind
the
lackeys
he
said
nothing
words
failed
him
i
see
that
your
young
highnesses
do
answer
said
the
shoemaker
and
his
honest
voice
was
filled
with
emotion
i
ought
to
have
told
you
because
it
is
your
business
to
get
to
know
all
the
wickedness
that
goes
on
but
yet
i
do
know
he
said
laid
his
head
on
one
side
and
snapped
his
fingers
that
it
can
do
any
harm
that
it
can
do
you
any
harm
for
the
future
and
later
on
the
lackeys
said
klaus
heinrich
and
took
a
plunge
are
they
wicked
i
can
quite
well
fancy
wicked
said
the
cobbler
they
are
that
the
name
for
them
do
you
know
what
they
good
for
they
keep
the
goods
back
when
no
tip
forthcoming
keep
them
back
when
the
tradesman
delivers
them
punctually
at
the
time
ordered
and
only
hand
them
over
days
late
so
that
the
tradesman
gets
blamed
and
is
considered
by
the
grand
duke
to
have
failed
in
his
duty
and
he
loses
his
orders
that
what
they
do
without
scruple
and
the
whole
town
knows
it
that
most
annoying
said
klaus
heinrich
he
listened
listened
he
hardly
realized
how
much
shocked
he
was
do
they
do
anything
else
he
said
i
quite
sure
they
must
do
other
things
of
the
same
kind
you
bet
said
the
man
and
laughed
no
they
do
miss
a
chance
let
me
tell
your
highnesses
they
have
all
sorts
of
dodges
there
the
joke
for
instance
that
like
this
your
father
our
gracious
grand
duke
grants
an
audience
to
somebody
let
suppose
a
new
hand
and
it
his
first
time
at
court
and
he
comes
in
a
frock
coat
all
sweat
and
shivers
for
it
is
of
course
no
trifle
to
stand
before
his
royal
highness
for
the
first
time
and
the
lackeys
laugh
at
him
because
they
quite
at
home
here
and
tow
him
into
the
and
he
does
know
where
he
is
and
absolutely
forgets
to
tip
the
lackeys
but
then
comes
his
moment
and
the
adjutant
says
his
name
and
the
lackeys
throw
open
the
and
let
him
into
the
room
in
which
the
grand
duke
is
waiting
then
the
new
hand
stands
there
and
bows
and
says
what
he
has
to
say
and
the
grand
duke
graciously
gives
him
his
hand
and
so
he
is
dismissed
and
walks
backwards
and
thinks
the
are
going
to
open
behind
him
as
he
has
been
definitely
promised
but
they
do
open
i
tell
your
highnesses
for
the
lackeys
have
got
their
knife
into
him
because
they
have
been
tipped
and
do
stir
a
finger
for
him
outside
there
but
he
dare
turn
round
absolutely
dare
because
he
dare
show
the
grand
duke
his
back
that
would
be
grossly
bad
manners
and
an
insult
to
his
highness
and
then
he
feels
behind
him
for
the
and
ca
find
it
and
gets
the
jumps
and
scrabbles
around
on
the
door
and
when
at
last
by
the
mercy
of
providence
he
finds
the
knob
it
an
lock
and
he
does
understand
it
and
fiddles
and
dislocates
his
arm
and
tires
himself
out
and
keeps
bowing
all
the
time
in
his
agitation
until
at
last
his
highness
graciously
lets
him
out
with
his
own
hand
yes
the
joke
but
that
nothing
to
what
i
going
to
tell
your
highness
they
had
been
so
deep
in
conversation
that
they
had
scarcely
noticed
where
they
were
going
had
gone
down
the
stairs
and
reached
the
close
to
the
albrechtstor
eiermann
one
of
the
grand
duchess
came
towards
them
he
wore
a
violet
coat
and
he
had
been
sent
out
to
look
for
their
grand
ducal
highnesses
he
shook
his
head
while
still
at
a
distance
in
lively
concern
and
pursed
his
mouth
up
like
a
funnel
but
when
he
noticed
shoemaker
hinnerke
walking
with
the
children
and
tapping
with
his
umbrella
all
the
muscles
of
his
face
relaxed
and
his
jaw
dropped
there
was
scarcely
time
for
thanks
and
farewells
eiermann
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
part
the
children
from
the
shoemaker
and
with
many
a
gloomy
prophecy
he
led
their
grand
ducal
highnesses
up
to
their
room
to
the
swiss
governess
eyes
were
turned
to
heaven
hands
were
wrung
about
their
absence
and
the
state
of
their
clothes
the
worst
of
all
happened
they
were
looked
at
sadly
but
klaus
heinrich
confined
his
contrition
to
the
bare
minimum
he
thought
so
the
lackeys
took
money
and
let
the
tradesmen
wander
about
the
corridors
if
they
did
not
get
any
kept
the
goods
back
that
the
tradesmen
might
get
blamed
and
did
not
open
the
so
that
the
suitor
had
to
scrabble
that
what
happened
in
the
schloss
and
what
must
it
be
outside
outside
among
the
people
who
stared
at
him
so
respectfully
and
so
strangely
when
he
drove
by
with
his
hand
to
his
hat
but
how
had
the
man
dared
to
tell
it
him
not
one
single
time
had
he
called
him
grand
ducal
highness
he
had
forced
himself
on
him
and
offended
his
birth
and
upbringing
and
yet
why
was
it
so
extraordinarily
pleasant
to
hear
all
that
about
the
lackeys
why
did
his
heart
beat
with
such
rapt
pleasure
when
moved
by
some
of
the
wild
and
bold
things
in
which
his
highness
bore
no
part
iv
doctor
ueberbein
klaus
heinrich
spent
three
of
his
boyhood
years
in
the
company
of
boys
of
his
own
age
of
the
court
and
country
nobility
of
the
monarchy
in
an
institution
a
kind
of
aristocratic
seminary
which
von
knobelsdorff
the
house
minister
had
founded
and
set
in
order
on
his
behalf
in
the
pheasantry
a
crown
property
for
centuries
past
schloss
pheasantry
gave
its
name
to
the
first
of
a
state
railway
running
from
the
capital
and
itself
took
it
from
a
tame
pheasant
preserve
situated
not
far
off
among
the
meadows
and
woods
which
had
been
the
hobby
of
a
former
ruler
the

a
country
house
with
a
shingle
roof
topped
by
lightning
conductors
stood
with
stables
and
on
the
skirts
of
extensive
fir
plantations
with
a
row
of
aged
lime
trees
in
front
it
looked
out
over
a
broad
expanse
of
meadowland
fringed
by
a
distant
bluish
circle
of
woods
and
intersected
by
paths
with
many
a
bare
patch
of
and
hurdles
for

riding
opposite
the
corner
of
the
schloss
was
a
refreshment
pavilion
a
beer
and
coffee
garden
planted
with
high
trees
which
a
prudent
man
called
stavenüter
had
rented
and
which
was
thronged
on
sundays
in
summer
by
excursionists
especially
bicyclists
from
the
capital
the
pupils
of
the
pheasantry
were
only
allowed
to
visit
the
pavilion
in
charge
of
a
tutor
there
were
five
of
them
not
counting
klaus

were
called

had
a
landau
from
the

which
had
seen
its
best
days
a
a
sledge
and
a
few
hacks
and
when
in
winter
some
of
the
meadows
were
flooded
and
frozen
over

had
an
opportunity
of
skating
there
was

suspicious
and
irritable
bachelor
with
the
airs
of
a
comic
actor
and
the
manners
of
an
old
french
chevalier
was
head
of
the
seminary
he
wore
a
stubby
grey
moustache
a
pair
of
gold
spectacles
in
front
of
his
restless
brown
eyes
and
always
a
top
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
stuck
his
belly
out
as
he
walked
and
held
his
little
fists
on
each
side
of
his
stomach
like
a
runner
he
treated
klaus
heinrich
with
tact
but
was
full
of
suspicion
of
the
noble
arrogance
of
his
other
pupils
and
fired
up
like
a
when
he
scented
any
signs
of
contempt
for
him
as
a
commoner
he
loved
when
out
for
a
walk
if
there
were
people
close
by
to
stop
and
gather
his
pupils
in
a
knot
around
him
and
explain
something
to
them
drawing

with
his
stick
he
addressed
frau
amelung
the
housekeeper
a
captain
widow
who
smelt
strongly
of
drugs
as
my
lady
and
showed
thus
that
he
knew
what
was
what
in
the
best
circles
professor
kürtchen
was
helped
by
a
yet
younger
assistant
teacher
with
a
doctor
degree
a
energetic
man
bumptious
but
enthusiastic
who
influenced
klaus
heinrich
views
and
conscience
perhaps
more
than
was
good
for
him
a
gymnastic
instructor
called
zotte
had
also
been
appointed
the
assistant

it
may
be
remarked
in

the

by

from

klaus

remarked
with
appreciation
that
the
demands
made
on
him
from
the
point
of
view
of
learning
quickly
abated
schulrat
wrinkled
no
longer
paused
on
the
lines
he
had
done
his
work
and
during
the
lessons
as
well
as
while
correcting
his
written
work
professor
kürtchen
seized
every
opportunity
of
showing
his
tact
one
day
quite
soon
after
the
institution
had
started
it
was
after
luncheon
in
the
he
summoned
klaus
heinrich
into
his
study
and
said
in
so
many
words
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
your
grand
ducal
highness
during
our
scientific
studies
together
should
be
compelled
to
answer
questions
which
are
at
the
moment
unwelcome
to
you
on
the
other
hand
it
is
desirable
that
your
grand
ducal
highness
should
continually
announce
your
readiness
to
answer
by
holding
up
your
hand
i
beg
your
grand
ducal
highness
accordingly
for
my
own
information
in
the
case
of
unwelcome
questions
to
stretch
out
your
arm
to
its
full
length
but
in
the
case
of
those
an
invitation
to
answer
which
would
be
agreeable
to
you
to
raise
it
only
half
way
and
in
a
right
angle
as
for
doctor
ueberbein
he
filled
the
schoolroom
with
a
noisy
flow
of
words
whose
cheerfulness
disguised
the
teacher
object
without
losing
sight
of
it
altogether
he
had
come
to
no
sort
of
understanding
with
klaus
heinrich
but
questioned
him
when
it
occurred
to
him
to
do
so
in
a
free
and
friendly
way
without
causing
him
any
embarrassment
and
klaus
heinrich
by
no
means
apropos
answers
seemed
to
enchant
doctor
ueberbein
to
inspire
him
with
warm
enthusiasm
ha
ha
he
would
cry
and
throw
his
head
back
laughing
oh
klaus
heinrich
oh
scion
of
princes
oh
your
innocency
the
crude
problems
of
life
have
caught
you
unprepared
now
then
it
is
for
me
with
my
experience
to
put
you
straight
and
he
gave
the
answer
himself
asked
nobody
else
when
klaus
heinrich
had
answered
wrong
the
mode
of
instruction
of
the
other
teachers
bore
the
character
of
an
unassuming
lecture
and
zotte
had
received
orders
from
high
quarters
to
conduct
the
physical
exercises
with
every
regard
to
klaus
left
hand
so
strictly
that
the
attention
of
the
prince
himself
or
of
his
companions
should
never
be
drawn
unnecessarily
to
his
little
failing
so
the
exercises
were
limited
to
running
games
and
during
the
riding
lessons
which
herr
zotte
also
gave
all
feats
of
daring
were
rigorously
excluded
klaus
heinrich
relations
with
his
comrades
were
not
what
one
might
call
intimate
they
did
not
extend
to
actual
familiarity
he
stood
for
himself
was
never
one
of
them
by
no
means
counted
amongst
their
number
they
were
five
and
he
was
one
the
prince
the
five
and
the
teachers
that
was
the
establishment
several
things
stood
in
the
way
of
a
free
friendship
the
five
were
there
on
klaus
heinrich
account
they
were
ordered
to
associate
with
him
when
during
the
lessons
he
answered
wrong
they
were
not
asked
to
correct
him
they
had
to
adjust
themselves
to
his
capacity
when
riding
or
playing
they
were
too
often
reminded
of
the
advantages
they
gained
by
being
allowed
to
share
his
life
some
of
them
the
young
von
gumplach
von
platow
and
von
wehrzahn
sons
of
country
squires
of
moderate
means
were
oppressed
the
whole
time
by
the
gratified
pride
their
parents
had
shown
when
the
invitation
from
the
house
minister
reached
them
by
the
congratulations
which
had
poured
in
from
every
side
count
prenzlau
on
the
other
hand
that
freckled
youth
with
the
breathless
way
of
speaking
and
the
christian
name
bogumil
was
a
sprig
of
the
richest
and
noblest
family
of
landowners
in
the
land
spoilt
and
he
was
well
aware
that
his
parents
had
not
been
able
to
refuse
baron
von
knobelsdorff
invitation
but
that
it
had
not
seemed
to
them
by
any
means
a
blessing
from
the
clouds
and
that
he
count
bogumil
could
have
lived
much
better
and
more
in
accordance
with
his
position
on
his
father
property
than
at
the
pheasantry
he
found
the
hacks
bad
the
landau
shabby
and
the
he
grumbled
privately
over
the
food
dagobert
count
trümmerhauff
a
spare
youth
who
spoke
in
a
whisper
was
inseparable
from
him
they
had
a
word
among
themselves
which
fully
expressed
their
critical
and
aristocratic
bent
and
which
they
constantly
uttered
in
a
biting
tone
of
voice
it
was
to
have
loose
collars
buttoning
on
to
one
shirt
it
was
to
play
in
one
ordinary
clothes
but
klaus
heinrich
felt
himself
unequal
to
using
the
word
he
had
not
hitherto
been
aware
that
there
were
such
things
as
shirts
with
collars
sewed
on
to
them
and
that
people
could
possess
so
many
changes
of
clothes
at
one
time
as
bogumil
prenzlau
he
would
have
liked
to
say
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
wearing
at
that
very
time
darned
socks
he
felt
inelegant
by
the
side
of
prenzlau
and
coarse
compared
with
trümmerhauff
trümmerhauff
had
the
nobility
of
a
wild
beast
he
had
a
long
pointed
nose
with
a
sharp
bridge
and
broad
quivering
nostrils
blue
veins
on
his
delicate
temples
and
small
ears
without
lobes
he
wore
broad
coloured
cuffs
fastened
with
gold
links
and
his
hands
were
like
those
of
a
dainty
woman
with
filbert
nails
a
gold
bracelet
adorned
one
of
his
wrists
he
half
closed
his
eyes
as
he
whispered
no
it
was
obvious
that
klaus
heinrich
could
not
compete
with
trümmerhauff
in
elegance
his
right
hand
was
rather
broad
he
had
like
the
men
in
the
street
and
he
looked
quite
stumpy
by
dagobert
side
it
was
quite
possible
that
albrecht
might
have
been
better
qualified
to
join
the
pheasants
in
their
use
of
klaus
heinrich
for
his
part
was
no
aristocrat
absolutely
none
unmistakable
facts
showed
that
for
consider
his
name
klaus
heinrich
that
what
the
shoemaker
sons
were
called
all
over
the
place
herr
stavenüter
children
over
the
road
too
who
blew
their
noses
with
their
fingers
bore
the
same
names
as
himself
his
parents
and
his
brother
but
the
lordlings
were
called
bogumil
and
dagobert
klaus
heinrich
stood
solitary
and
alone
among
the
five
however
he
formed
one
friendship
at
the
pheasantry
and
it
was
with
doctor
ueberbein
the
usher
raoul
ueberbein
was
not
a
handsome
man
he
had
a
red
beard
and
a
complexion
with
watery
blue
eyes
thin
red
hair
and
unusually
ugly
protruding
ears
but
his
hands
were
small
and
delicate
he
wore
white
ties
exclusively
which
gave
him
rather
a
distinguished
appearance
although
his
wardrobe
was
scanty
he
wore
a
long
and
when
riding
for
ueberbein
rode
and
excellently
well
too
a
whose
skirts
he
fastened
up
with
tight
buttoned
breeches
and
a
high
hat
where
lay
the
attraction
he
exercised
on
klaus
heinrich
that
attraction
was
very
composite
the
pheasants
had
not
been
long
together
before
a
report
went
about
that
the
usher
had
dragged
a
child
a
long
time
ago
in
circumstances
of
extreme
peril
out
of
a
swamp
or
bog
and
was
the
possessor
of
a
medal
for
saving
life
that
was
one
impression
later
other
details
of
doctor
ueberbein
life
came
to
be
known
and
klaus
heinrich
too
heard
of
them
it
was
said
that
his
origin
was
obscure
that
he
had
no
father
his
mother
had
been
an
actress
who
had
paid
some
poor
people
to
adopt
him
and
that
he
had
once
been
starved
which
accounted
for
the
greenish
tint
of
his
complexion
these
were
things
which
did
not
bear
being
brought
into
the
light
or
even
being
thought
of
wild
remote
things
to
which
however
doctor
ueberbein
himself
sometimes
alluded
when
for
instance
the
lordlings
who
could
not
forget
his
obscure
origin
behaved
impudently
or
unbecomingly
towards
him
and
mammy
darlings
he
would
say
then
in
loud
dudgeon
i
knocked
about
long
enough
to
deserve
some
respect
from
you
young
gentlemen
this
fact
too
that
doctor
ueberbein
had
knocked
about
did
not
fail
of
effect
on
klaus
heinrich
but
the
especial
charm
of
the
doctor
person
lay
in
the
directness
of
his
attitude
towards
klaus
heinrich
the
tone
in
which
he
addressed
him
from
the
very
beginning
and
which
distinguished
him
clearly
from
everybody
else
there
was
nothing
about
him
which
reminded
one
of
the
stiff
reticence
of
the
lackeys
of
the
governess
pale
horror
of
schulrat
professional
bows
or
of
professor
kürtchen
deference
there
was
nothing
about
him
to
recall
the
strange
loyal
and
yet
impertinent
way
in
which
people
outside
stared
at
klaus
heinrich
during
the
first
few
days
after
the
seminary
assembled
he
kept
silence
and
confined
himself
to
observation
but
then
he
approached
the
prince
with
a
jovial
and
cheery
frankness
a
fresh
fatherly
camaraderie
such
as
klaus
heinrich
had
never
before
experienced
it
disturbed
him
at
first
he
looked
in
terror
at
the
doctor
green
face
but
his
confusion
found
no
echo
in
the
doctor
and
in
no
way
discouraged
him
it
confirmed
him
in
his
hearty
bumptious
ingenuousness
and
it
was
not
long
before
klaus
heinrich
was
warmed
and
won
for
there
was
nothing
vulgar
nothing
degrading
not
even
anything
designed
and
in
doctor
ueberbein
methods
all
they
showed
was
the
superiority
of
a
man
who
had
knocked
about
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
his
tender
and
open
respect
for
klaus
heinrich
different
birth
and
position
they
showed
affection
and
recognition
at
the
same
time
as
the
cheerful
offer
of
a
league
between
their
two
different
kinds
of
existence
he
called
him
highness
once
or
twice
then
simply
prince
then
quite
simply
klaus
heinrich
and
he
stuck
to
the
last
when
the
pheasants
went
out
for
a
ride
these
two
rode
at
the
head
the
doctor
on
his
stout
piebald
to
the
left
of
klaus
heinrich
on
his
docile
chestnut
trotted
when
snow
or
leaves
were
falling
through
springtime
thaws
or
summer
heat
along
the
edge
of
the
woodlands
across
country
or
through
the
villages
while
doctor
ueberbein
related
anecdotes
of
his
life
raoul
ueberbein
sounds
funny
does
it
the
very
reverse
of
yes
ueberbein
had
been
the
name
of
his
adoptive
parents
a
poor
oldish
couple
of
the
inferior
class
and
he
had
a
quite
legal
right
to
it
but
that
he
should
be
called
raoul
had
been
the
decision
and
mandate
of
his
mother
when
she
handed
over
the
sum
agreed
on
together
with
his
fateful
little
person
to
the
others
a
sentimental
decision
obviously
a
decision
prompted
by
piety
at
least
it
was
quite
possible
that
his
legal
and
real
father
had
been
called
raoul
and
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
his
surname
had
been
something
which
harmonized
with
it
for
the
rest
it
had
been
rather
a
wild
undertaking
on
the
part
of
his
adoptive
parents
to
adopt
a
child
for
barmecide
had
been
cook
in
the
ueberbein
establishment
and
it
was
obvious
that
it
had
been
only
the
most
urgent
necessity
which
had
made
them
jump
at
the
money
the
boy
had
been
given
only
the
scantiest
of
school
educations
but
he
had
taken
the
liberty
of
showing
what
he
was
made
of
had
distinguished
himself
to
some
extent
and
as
he
was
keen
to
become
a
teacher
he
had
been
granted
out
of
a
public
fund
the
means
of
obtaining
a
college
education
well
he
had
finished
his
college
course
not
without
distinction
as
indeed
it
was
expected
of
him
that
he
should
and
he
had
then
been
appointed
a
teacher
in
a
public
elementary
school
with
a
good
salary
out
of
which
he
had
managed
to
give
occasional
doles
by
way
of
gratitude
to
his
honest
adoptive
parents
until
they
died
almost
simultaneously
and
a
happy
release
it
was
for
them
and
so
he
had
been
left
alone
in
the
world
his
very
birth
a
misfortune
as
poor
as
a
sparrow
and
endowed
by
providence
with
a
green
face
and
dog
ears
by
way
of
personal
recommendations
attractive
qualifications
were
they
not
but
such
qualifications
were
really
favourable
ones
once
for
all
so
they
proved
a
miserable
boyhood
loneliness
and
exclusion
from
good
fortune
and
all
that
good
fortune
brings
a
imperious
call
to
be
up
and
doing
no
fear
of
getting
fat
and
lazy
one
moral
fibre
was
braced
one
could
never
rest
on
one
oars
but
must
be
always
overhauling
and
passing
others
could
anything
be
more
stimulating
when
the
hard
facts
were
brought
home
to
one
what
a
handicap
over
others
who
were
not
obliged
to
to
the
same
extent
people
who
could
smoke
cigars
in
the
morning
at
that
time
by
the
bedside
of
one
of
his
unwashed
little
pupils
in
a
room
which
did
not
smell
exactly
of
spring
blossoms
raoul
ueberbein
had
made
friends
with
a
young
man
some
years
older
than
he
but
in
a
similar
position
and
like
him
by
birth
in
so
far
as
he
was
a
jew
klaus
heinrich
knew
him
indeed
he
might
be
said
to
have
got
to
know
him
on
a
very
intimate
occasion
sammet
was
his
name
a
doctor
of
medicine
he
happened
by
chance
to
have
been
in
the
grimmburg
when
klaus
heinrich
was
born
and
had
set
up
a
couple
of
years
later
in
the
capital
as
a
children
doctor
well
he
had
been
a
friend
of
ueberbein
still
was
one
and
they
had
had
many
a
good
talk
about
fate
and
duty
what
is
more
they
had
both
knocked
about
the
world
ueberbein
for
his
part
looked
back
with
sincere
pleasure
to
the
time
when
he
had
been
an
elementary
teacher
his
activities
had
not
been
entirely
confined
to
the
he
had
amused
himself
by
showing
also
some
personal
and
human
concern
for
his
charges
welfare
by
visiting
them
at
home
by
sharing
at
times
their
not
too
idyllic
family
life
and
in
doing
so
he
did
not
fail
to
bring
away
impressions
of
a
most
varied
kind
in
truth
if
he
had
not
already
tasted
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
of
life
he
would
have
had
plenty
of
opportunity
then
to
do
so
for
the
rest
he
had
not
ceased
to
work
by
himself
had
given
private
lessons
to
plump
tradesmen
sons
and
tightened
his
waist
belt
so
as
to
save
enough
to
buy
books
with
had
spent
the
long
still
and
free
nights
in
study
and
one
day
he
had
passed
the
state
examination
with
exceptional
distinction
had
soon
received
his
promotion
had
been
transferred
to
a
grammar
school
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
been
a
sore
grief
to
him
to
leave
his
little
charges
but
so
the
fates
willed
and
then
it
had
so
happened
that
he
had
been
chosen
to
be
usher
at
the
pheasantry
for
all
that
his
very
birth
had
been
a
misfortune
that
was
doctor
ueberbein
story
and
klaus
heinrich
as
he
listened
to
it
was
filled
with
friendly
feelings
he
shared
his
contempt
for
those
who
were
obliged
to
and
smoked
cigars
in
the
morning
he
felt
a
fearful
joy
when
ueberbein
talked
in
his
jolly
blustering
way
about
knocking
about
impressions
and
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
of
life
and
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
personally
an
actor
in
the
scenes
as
he
followed
his
luckless
and
gallant
career
from
his
adoption
up
to
his
appointment
as
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
some
general
sort
of
way
qualified
to
take
part
in
a
conversation
about
fate
and
duty
his
attitude
of
reserve
relaxed
the
experiences
of
his
own
fifteen
years
of
life
came
crowding
in
upon
him
he
felt
a
longing
himself
to
retail
confidences
and
he
tried
to
tell
doctor
ueberbein
all
about
himself
but
the
funny
thing
was
that
doctor
ueberbein
himself
checked
him
opposed
any
such
intention
most
decidedly
no
no
klaus
heinrich
he
said
full
stop
there
no
confidences
if
you
please
not
but
that
i
know
that
you
have
all
sorts
of
things
to
tell
me
i
need
only
watch
you
for
half
a
day
to
see
that
but
you
quite
misunderstand
me
if
you
think
i
likely
to
encourage
you
to
weep
round
my
neck
in
the
first
place
sooner
or
later
you
repent
it
but
in
the
second
the
pleasures
of
a
confidential
intimacy
are
not
for
the
likes
of
you
you
see
there
no
harm
in
my
chattering
what
am
i
an
usher
not
a
common
or
garden
one
in
my
own
opinion
but
still
no
better
than
such
just
a
categorical
unit
but
you
what
are
you
that
harder
to
say
say
a
conception
a
kind
of
ideal
a
frame
an
emblematical
existence
klaus
heinrich
and
at
the
same
time
a
formal
existence
but
formality
and
intimacy
have
you
yet
learnt
that
the
two
are
mutually
exclusive
absolutely
exclusive
you
have
no
right
to
intimate
confidences
and
if
you
attempted
them
you
yourself
would
discover
that
they
did
not
suit
you
would
find
them
inadequate
and
insipid
i
must
remind
you
of
your
duty
klaus
heinrich
klaus
heinrich
laughed
and
saluted
with
his
crop
and
on
they
rode
on
another
occasion
doctor
ueberbein
said
casually
popularity
is
a
not
very
profound
but
a
grand
and
comprehensive
kind
of
familiarity
and
that
was
all
he
said
on
the
subject
sometimes
in
summer
during
the
long
intervals
between
the
morning
lessons
they
would
sit
together
in
the
empty
pavilion
or
stroll
about
the
pheasants
playground
discussing
various
topics
and
breaking
off
to
drink
lemonade
provided
by
herr
stavenüter
herr
stavenüter
beamed
as
he
wiped
the
rough
table
and
brought
the
lemonade
with
his
own
hands
the
glass
ball
in
the
had
to
be
pushed
in
sound
stuff
said
herr
stavenüter
the
best
that
can
be
got
no
muck
grand
ducal
highness
and
you
doctor
but
just
sweetened
i
can
honestly
recommend
it
then
he
made
his
children
sing
in
honour
of
the
visit
there
were
three
of
them
two
girls
and
a
boy
and
they
could
sing
trios
they
stood
some
way
off
with
the
green
leaves
of
the
chestnut
trees
for
roof
and
sang
while
they
blew
their
noses
with
their
fingers
once
they
sang
a
song
beginning
we
are
all
but
mortal
men
and
doctor
ueberbein
took
advantage
of
the
pauses
to
express
his
disapproval
of
this
number
on
the
programme
a
paltry
song
he
said
and
leaned
over
towards
klaus
heinrich
a
really
commonplace
song
a
lazy
song
klaus
heinrich
you
must
not
let
it
appeal
to
you
later
when
the
children
had
stopped
singing
he
returned
to
the
song
and
described
it
as
sloppy
we
are
all
but
mortal
men
he
repeated
god
bless
us
yes
no
doubt
we
are
but
on
the
other
hand
we
ought
perhaps
to
remember
that
it
is
those
of
us
who
count
for
most
who
may
be
the
occasion
for
especially
emphasizing
this
truth
look
you
he
said
leaning
back
and
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
while
he
stroked
his
beard
up
from
underneath
his
chin
look
you
klaus
heinrich
a
man
who
has
my
intellectual
aspirations
will
not
be
able
to
help
searching
for
and
clinging
to
whatever
is
out
of
the
ordinary
in
this
drab
world
of
ours
wherever
and
however
it
appears
he
can
not
help
being
put
out
by
such
a
slovenly
song
by
such
a
sheepish
abjuration
of
the
exceptional
of
the
lofty
and
of
the
miserable
and
of
that
which
is
both
at
once
you
may
well
say
talking
for
effect
i
only
an
usher
but
there
something
in
my
blood
heaven
knows
what
i
find
any
pleasure
in
emphasizing
the
fact
that
we
are
all
ushers
at
bottom
i
love
the
extraordinary
in
every
form
and
in
every
sense
i
love
those
who
are
conscious
of
the
dignity
of
their
exceptional
station
the
marked
men
those
one
can
see
are
not
as
other
men
all
those
whom
the
people
stare
at
i
hope
they
appreciate
their
destiny
and
i
do
not
wish
them
to
make
themselves
comfortable
with
the
and
truth
which
we
have
just
heard
set
to
music
for
three
voices
why
have
i
become
your
tutor
klaus
heinrich
i
am
a
gipsy
a
one
maybe
but
still
a
born
gipsy
my
predestination
to
the
rôle
of
squire
of
princes
is
not
particularly
obvious
why
did
i
gladly
obey
the
call
when
it
came
to
me
in
view
of
my
energy
and
although
my
very
birth
was
a
misfortune
because
klaus
heinrich
i
see
in
your
existence
the
clearest
most
express
and
form
of
the
extraordinary
in
the
world
i
have
become
your
tutor
that
i
might
keep
your
destiny
alive
in
you
reserve
etiquette
obligation
duty
demeanour
formality
has
the
man
whose
life
is
surrounded
by
these
no
right
to
despise
others
ought
he
to
allow
himself
to
be
reminded
of
humanity
and
good
nature
no
come
along
let
go
klaus
heinrich
if
you
do
mind
they
tactless
brats
these
little
stavenüters
klaus
heinrich
laughed
he
gave
the
children
some
of
his
and
they
went
yes
yes
said
doctor
ueberbein
in
the
course
of
an
ordinary
walk
in
the
woods
to
klaus
heinrich
they
had
drifted
a
little
distance
away
from
the
five
pheasants
nowadays
the
soul
thirst
for
veneration
has
to
be
satisfied
with
what
it
can
get
where
will
you
find
greatness
i
only
hope
you
may
but
quite
apart
from
all
actual
greatness
and
there
is
always
what
i
call
highness
select
and
sadly
isolated
forms
of
life
towards
which
an
attitude
of
the
tenderest
sympathy
should
be
adopted
for
the
rest
greatness
is
strong
it
wears
it
has
no
need
of
the
of
the
mind
but
highness
is
affecting
damme
if
it
is
the
most
affecting
thing
on
earth
once
or
twice
a
year
the
pheasantry
journeyed
to
the
capital
to
attend
performances
of
classical
operas
and
dramas
in
the
grand
ducal
court
theatre
klaus
heinrich
birthday
in
particular
was
the
signal
for
a
visit
to
the
theatre
he
would
then
sit
quietly
in
his
carved
leaning
against
the
red
plush
ledge
of
the
court
box
whose
roof
rested
on
the
heads
of
two
female
figures
with
crossed
hands
and
empty
stern
faces
and
watched
his
colleagues
the
princes
whose
destinies
were
played
out
on
the
stage
while
he
stood
the
fire
of
the
which
from
time
to
time
even
during
the
play
were
directed
at
him
from
the
audience
professor
kürtchen
sat
on
his
left
hand
and
doctor
ueberbein
with
the
pheasants
in
an
adjoining
box
once
they
heard
the
magic
flute
and
on
the
way
home
to
pheasantry
station
in
the
carriage
doctor
ueberbein
made
the
whole
collection
of
them
laugh
by
imitating
the
way
in
which
singers
talk
when
their
rôles
oblige
them
to
talk
in
prose
he
is
a
prince
he
said
with
pathos
and
answered
himself
in
a
drawly
parsonical
voice
he
is
more
than
that
he
is
a
man
even
professor
kürtchen
was
so
much
amused
that
he
bleated
but
next
day
in
the
course
of
a
private
lesson
in
klaus
study
with
the
round
mahogany
table
whitened
ceiling
and
greek
bust
on
the
stove
doctor
ueberbein
repeated
his
parody
and
said
then
great
heavens
that
was
something
new
in
its
time
it
was
a
piece
of
news
a
startling
truth
there
are
paradoxes
which
have
stood
so
long
on
their
heads
that
one
has
to
put
them
on
their
feet
to
make
anything
even
moderately
daring
out
of
them
is
a
man
he
is
more
than
that
that
is
getting
gradually
bolder
prettier
even
truer
the
converse
is
mere
humanity
but
i
have
no
hearty
love
for
humanity
i
quite
content
to
leave
it
out
of
account
one
must
in
a
certain
sense
be
one
of
those
of
whom
the
people
say
are
after
all
mortal
men
too
or
one
is
as
deadly
dull
as
an
usher
i
can
not
honestly
wish
for
the
general
comfortable
obliteration
of
conflicts
and
gulfs
that
the
way
i
am
made
for
better
or
worse
and
the
idea
of
the
is
to
me
to
speak
plainly
an
abomination
i
am
not
anxious
that
it
should
particularly
appeal
to
you
look
you
there
have
always
been
princes
and
exceptional
persons
who
live
their
life
of
exception
with
a
light
heart
simply
unconscious
of
their
dignity
or
denying
it
outright
and
capable
of
playing
skittles
with
the
townsfolk
in
their
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
an
inward
qualm
but
they
are
not
very
important
just
as
nothing
is
important
which
lacks
mind
for
mind
klaus
heinrich
mind
is
the
tutor
which
insists
inexorably
on
dignity
indeed
actually
creates
dignity
it
is
the
and
chief
antagonist
of
all
human
good
nature
than
that
no
to
be
a
representative
to
stand
for
a
number
when
one
appears
to
be
the
exalted
and
refined
expression
of
a
multitude
representing
is
naturally
something
more
and
higher
than
simply
being
klaus
heinrich
and
why
people
call
you
highness
so
argued
doctor
ueberbein
in
loud
hearty
and
fluent
terms
and
what
he
said
influenced
klaus
heinrich
mind
and
susceptibilities
more
perhaps
than
was
desirable
the
prince
was
then
about
fifteen
years
old
and
therefore
quite
competent
if
not
properly
to
understand
yet
to
imbibe
the
essence
of
ideas
of
that
sort
the
main
point
was
that
doctor
ueberbein
doctrines
and
apophthegms
were
so
exceptionally
supported
by
his
personality
when
schulrat
dröge
the
man
who
used
to
bow
to
the
lackeys
reminded
klaus
heinrich
of
his
exalted
calling
that
was
nothing
more
than
an
exaggerated
form
of
speech
devoid
of
inner
meaning
and
calculated
mainly
to
add
emphasis
to
his
professional
claims
but
when
doctor
ueberbein
whose
very
birth
had
been
a
misfortune
as
he
said
and
who
had
a
green
complexion
because
he
had
been
half
starved
when
this
man
who
had
dragged
a
child
out
of
a
bog
who
had
received
impressions
and
knocked
about
in
all
sorts
of
ways
when
he
who
not
only
did
not
bow
to
the
lackeys
but
who
bawled
at
them
in
strident
tones
when
the
fancy
took
him
and
who
had
called
klaus
heinrich
himself
straight
out
by
his
christian
names
when
he
had
known
him
only
three
days
without
asking
leave
to
do
so
when
he
with
a
paternal
laugh
declared
that
klaus
heinrich
path
lay
among
the
heights
of
mankind
a
favourite
expression
of
his
the
effect
was
a
feeling
of
freedom
and
originality
which
awoke
an
echo
deep
down
in
the
prince
soul
when
klaus
heinrich
listened
to
the
doctor
loud
and
jolly
anecdotes
of
his
life
of
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
of
life
he
felt
as
he
used
to
when
he
went
rummaging
with
ditlinde
his
sister
and
that
the
man
who
could
tell
such
anecdotes
that
this
rolling
stone
as
he
called
himself
did
not
like
the
others
adopt
a
reserved
and
deferential
attitude
towards
him
but
without
prejudice
to
a
free
and
cheerful
homage
treated
him
as
a
comrade
in
fate
and
destiny
warmed
klaus
heinrich
heart
to
inexpressible
gratitude
and
completed
the
charm
which
bound
him
to
the
usher
for
ever
shortly
after
his
sixteenth
birthday
albrecht
the
heir
apparent
was
at
the
time
in
the
south
for
his
health
the
prince
was
confirmed
together
with
the
five
pheasants
in
the
court
church
the
reported
the
fact
without
making
any
sensation
of
it
dom
wislezenus
the
president
of
the
high
consistory
treated
a
bible
text
in
counterpoint
this
time
to
the
choice
of
the
grand
duke
and
klaus
heinrich
was
on
this
occasion
gazetted
a
lieutenant
although
he
had
not
the
foggiest
notion
of
things
military
his
existence
was
becoming
more
and
more
barren
of
the
ceremonial
of
the
confirmation
also
lacked
incisive
significance
and
the
prince
returned
immediately
afterwards
quietly
back
to
the
pheasantry
to
continue
his
life
amongst
his
tutors
and
schoolfellows
without
any
alteration
it
was
not
till
one
year
later
that
he
left
his
homely
schoolroom
with
the
torso
on
the
stove
the
seminary
was
broken
up
and
while
his
five
noble
comrades
were
transferred
to
the
corps
of
cadets
klaus
heinrich
again
took
up
his
abode
in
the
old
schloss
intending
in
accordance
with
an
agreement
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
come
to
with
the
grand
duke
to
spend
a
year
at
the
upper
gymnasium
classes
in
the
capital
this
was
a
and
popular
step
which
however
did
not
make
much
difference
from
the
point
of
view
of
professor
kürtchen
had
gone
back
to
his
post
at
the
public
academy
he
instructed
klaus
heinrich
as
before
in
several
branches
of
knowledge
and
showed
even
greater
zeal
than
he
had
at
the
seminary
being
determined
to
let
everybody
see
how
tactful
he
was
it
also
appeared
that
he
had
told
the
rest
of
the
staff
of
the
agreement
reached
with
regard
to
the
two
ways
in
which
the
prince
should
announce
his
feelings
with
regard
to
answering
a
question
as
to
doctor
ueberbein
who
had
also
returned
to
the
academy
he
had
not
yet
advanced
so
far
in
his
unusual
career
as
to
teach
the
highest
class
but
at
klaus
heinrich
lively
even
insistent
request
preferred
by
him
to
the
grand
duke
not
by
word
of
mouth
but
by
official
channels
so
to
speak
through
the
benevolent
herr
von
knobelsdorff
the
usher
was
appointed
tutor
and
superintendent
of
home
studies
came
daily
to
the
schloss
bawled
at
the
lackeys
and
had
every
opportunity
of
working
on
the
prince
with
his
intellectual
and
enthusiastic
talk
perhaps
it
was
partly
the
fault
of
this
influence
that
klaus
heinrich
relations
with
the
young
people
with
whom
he
shared
the
continued
even
looser
and
more
distant
than
his
connexion
with
the
five
at
the
pheasantry
and
if
thus
the
popularity
which
this
year
was
intended
to
secure
was
not
attained
the
intervals
which
both
in
summer
and
in
winter
were
spent
by
all
the
scholars
in
the
roomy
paved
courtyard
offered
opportunities
for
camaraderie
but
these
intervals
intended
to
refresh
the
ordinary
scholars
brought
with
them
for
klaus
heinrich
the
first
actual
effort
of
the
kind
of
which
his
life
was
to
be
full
he
was
naturally
at
least
during
the
first
term
the
cynosure
of
every
eye
in
the
no
easy
matter
for
him
in
view
of
the
fact
that
here
the
surroundings
deprived
him
of
every
external
support
and
attribute
of
dignity
and
he
was
obliged
to
play
on
the
same
pavement
as
those
whose
common
idea
was
to
stare
at
him
the
little
boys
full
of
childlike
irresponsibility
hung
about
close
to
him
and
gaped
while
the
bigger
ones
hovered
around
with
eyes
and
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
them
or
from
under
their
eyelids
the
excitement
dwindled
in
course
of
time
but
even
then
whether
the
fault
was
klaus
heinrich
or
the
others
even
later
the
camaraderie
somehow
did
not
make
much
progress
one
might
see
the
prince
on
the
right
of
the
head
master
or
the
followed
and
surrounded
by
the
curious
strolling
up
and
down
the
courtyard
one
could
see
him
too
chatting
with
his
schoolfellows
what
a
charming
sight
it
was
there
he
leaned
on
the
slope
of
the
wall
with
his
feet
crossed
and
his
left
hand
thrust
far
behind
on
his
hips
with
the
fifteen
members
of
the
first
class
in
a
round
him
there
were
only
fifteen
this
year
for
the
last
promotions
had
been
made
with
the
object
in
view
that
the
select
should
contain
no
elements
which
were
unfitted
by
origin
or
personality
to
be
for
a
year
on
terms
with
klaus
heinrich
for
the
use
of
christian
names
was
ordered
klaus
heinrich
conversed
with
one
of
them
who
had
advanced
a
little
towards
him
out
of
the
semicircle
and
answered
him
with
little
short
bows
both
laughed
everybody
laughed
directly
they
began
to
talk
to
klaus
heinrich
he
asked
him
for
instance
have
you
yet
done
your
german
essay
for
next
tuesday
no
prince
klaus
heinrich
not
quite
yet
i
have
yet
done
the
last
part
it
a
difficult
subject
i
have
any
idea
yet
what
to
write
oh
your
highness
will
you
soon
think
of
something
no
it
difficult
you
got
an
alpha
in
arithmetic
did
you
yes
prince
klaus
heinrich
i
was
lucky
no
you
deserved
it
i
shall
never
be
able
to
make
anything
of
it
murmurs
of
amusement
and
gratification
in
the
semicircle
klaus
heinrich
turned
to
another
schoolfellow
and
the
first
stepped
quickly
back
everybody
felt
that
the
really
important
point
was
not
the
essay
nor
the
arithmetic
but
the
conversation
as
an
event
and
an
undertaking
attitude
and
tone
the
way
one
advanced
or
retired
the
success
with
which
one
assumed
a
sympathetic
and
refined
demeanour
perhaps
it
was
the
consciousness
of
this
which
brought
the
smile
to
everybody
lips
sometimes
when
he
had
the
semicircle
in
front
of
him
klaus
heinrich
would
say
some
such
words
as
professor
nicolovius
looks
an
owl
great
then
was
the
merriment
among
the
others
such
a
remark
was
the
signal
for
general
unbending
they
kicked
over
the
traces
ho
ho
ho
in
chorus
in
their
newly
cracked
voices
and
one
would
declare
klaus
heinrich
to
be
a
ripping
chap
but
klaus
heinrich
did
not
often
say
such
things
he
only
said
them
when
he
saw
the
smile
on
the
faces
grow
faint
and
wan
and
signs
of
boredom
or
even
of
impatience
showing
themselves
he
said
them
by
way
of
cheering
them
up
and
at
the
extravagant
laughter
by
which
they
were
followed
he
wore
a
look
half
of
curiosity
half
of
dismay
it
was
not
anselm
schickedanz
who
called
him
a
ripping
chap
and
yet
it
was
directly
on
his
account
that
klaus
heinrich
had
compared
professor
nicolovius
to
an
owl
anselm
schickedanz
had
laughed
like
the
others
at
the
joke
but
not
in
quite
the
same
approving
way
but
with
an
intonation
which
implied
gracious
heavens
he
was
a
dark
boy
with
narrow
hips
who
enjoyed
the
reputation
throughout
the
school
of
being
a
devil
of
a
chap
the
tone
of
the
top
class
this
year
was
admirable
the
obligations
which
membership
of
klaus
heinrich
class
entailed
had
been
impressed
on
every
boy
from
various
quarters
and
klaus
heinrich
was
not
the
boy
to
tempt
them
to
forget
these
obligations
but
that
anselm
schickedanz
was
a
devil
of
a
chap
had
often
come
to
his
ears
and
klaus
heinrich
when
he
looked
at
him
felt
a
kind
of
satisfaction
in
believing
what
he
heard
although
it
was
an
obscure
problem
to
him
how
he
could
have
come
by
his
reputation
he
made
several
inquiries
privately
broached
the
subject
apparently
by
chance
and
tried
to
find
out
from
one
or
other
of
his
comrades
something
about
schickedanz
devilry
he
discovered
nothing
definite
but
the
answers
whether
disparaging
or
complimentary
filled
him
with
the
suspicion
of
a
mad
amiability
an
unlawful
glorious
humanity
which
was
there
for
the
eyes
of
all
save
his
own
to
see
and
this
suspicion
was
almost
a
sorrow
everybody
said
at
once
with
reference
to
anselm
schickedanz
and
in
saying
it
dropped
into
the
forbidden
form
of
address
yes
highness
you
ought
to
see
him
when
you
are
not
there
klaus
heinrich
would
never
see
him
when
he
was
not
there
would
never
get
near
him
never
get
to
know
him
he
stole
peeps
at
him
when
he
stood
with
the
others
in
a
semicircle
before
him
laughing
and
braced
up
like
all
the
rest
everybody
braced
himself
up
in
klaus
heinrich
presence
his
very
existence
was
accountable
for
that
as
he
well
knew
and
he
would
never
see
what
schickedanz
was
like
how
he
behaved
when
he
let
himself
go
at
the
thought
he
felt
a
twinge
of
envy
a
tiny
spark
of
regret
at
this
juncture
something
painful
in
fact
revolting
occurred
of
which
nothing
came
to
the
ears
of
the
grand
ducal
couple
because
doctor
ueberbein
kept
his
mouth
closed
and
about
which
scarcely
any
rumour
spread
in
the
capital
because
everybody
who
had
had
a
share
or
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
obviously
from
a
kind
of
feeling
of
shame
preserved
strict
silence
about
it
i
refer
to
the
improprieties
which
occurred
in
connexion
with
prince
klaus
heinrich
presence
at
that
year
citizens
ball
and
in
which
a
fräulein
unschlitt
daughter
of
the
wealthy
was
especially
concerned
the
citizens
ball
was
a
chronic
fixture
in
the
social
life
of
the
capital
an
official
and
at
the
same
time
informal
festivity
which
was
given
by
the
city
every
winter
in
the
townpark
hotel
a
big
recently
enlarged
and
renovated
establishment
in
the
southern
suburbs
and
provided
the
bourgeois
circles
with
an
opportunity
of
establishing
friendly
relations
with
the
court
it
was
known
that
johann
albrecht
iii
had
never
cultivated
a
taste
for
this
civil
and
rather
entertainment
at
which
he
appeared
in
a
black
in
order
to
lead
off
the
polonaise
with
the
lady
mayoress
and
that
he
was
wont
to
withdraw
from
it
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
this
only
heightened
the
general
satisfaction
when
his
second
son
although
not
yet
bound
to
do
so
already
made
his
appearance
at
the
ball
that
year
indeed
it
became
known
that
he
did
so
at
his
own
express
request
it
was
said
that
the
prince
had
employed
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
to
transmit
his
earnest
wish
to
the
grand
duchess
who
in
her
turn
had
contrived
to
obtain
her
husband
consent
outwardly
the
festivity
pursued
its
wonted
course
the
most
distinguished
guests
princess
catherine
in
a
coloured
silk
dress
and
cap
accompanied
by
her
children
prince
lambert
with
his
pretty
wife
and
last
of
all
johann
albrecht
and
dorothea
with
prince
klaus
heinrich
made
their
appearance
in
the
townpark
hotel
greeted
by
city
officials
with
rosettes
pinned
on
their
coats
several
ministers
in
mufti
numbers
of
men
and
women
of
the
court
the
leaders
of
society
as
well
as
landowners
from
the
surrounding
country
were
present
in
the
big
white
hall
the
grand
ducal
pairs
first
received
a
string
of
presentations
and
then
to
the
strains
of
the
band
which
sat
in
the
curved
gallery
up
above
johann
albrecht
with
the
lady
mayoress
dorothea
with
the
lord
mayor
opened
the
ball
by
a
procession
round
the
room
then
while
the
polonaise
gave
place
to
a
round
dance
contentment
spread
cheeks
glowed
the
heat
of
the
throng
kindled
feelings
of
fondness
faintness
and
foreboding
among
the
dancers
the
distinguished
guests
stood
as
distinguished
guests
are
wont
to
stand
on
such
occasions
apart
and
smiling
graciously
on
the
platform
at
the
top
of
the
hall
under
the
gallery
from
time
to
time
johann
albrecht
engaged
a
distinguished
man
and
dorothea
engaged
his
wife
in
conversation
those
addressed
stepped
quickly
and
smartly
forward
and
back
kept
their
distance
with
their
heads
bent
nodded
shook
their
heads
laughed
in
this
attitude
at
the
questions
and
remarks
addressed
to
them
answered
eagerly
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
with
sudden
and
anticipatory
changes
from
hearty
amusement
to
the
deepest
earnestness
with
a
passionateness
which
was
doubtless
unusual
to
them
and
obviously
in
a
state
of
tension
curious
guests
still
panting
from
the
dance
stood
in
a
semicircle
round
and
stared
at
these
purposely
trivial
conversations
with
a
peculiarly
tense
expression
on
their
faces
klaus
heinrich
was
the
object
of
much
attention
together
with
two
cousins
who
were
already
in
the
army
but
were
wearing
mufti
that
evening
he
kept
a
little
behind
his
parents
resting
on
one
leg
his
left
hand
placed
far
back
on
his
hip
his
face
turned
with
his
right
to
the
public
a
reporter
of
the
who
had
been
bidden
to
the
ball
made
notes
upon
him
in
a
corner
the
prince
could
be
seen
to
greet
with
his
right
hand
his
tutor
doctor
ueberbein
who
with
his
red
beard
and
greenish
tint
came
along
the
fence
of
spectators
he
was
seen
even
to
advance
some
way
into
the
hall
to
meet
him
the
doctor
with
big
enamel
studs
in
his
shirt
front
began
by
bowing
when
klaus
heinrich
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
but
then
at
once
spoke
to
him
in
his
free
and
fatherly
way
the
prince
seemed
to
be
rejecting
a
proposal
and
laughed
uneasily
as
he
did
so
but
then
a
number
of
people
distinctly
heard
doctor
ueberbein
say
no
nonsense
klaus
heinrich
what
was
the
good
of
learning
why
did
the
swiss
governess
teach
you
your
steps
in
your
tenderest
years
i
understand
why
you
go
to
balls
if
you
wo
dance
one
two
three
we
soon
find
you
a
partner
and
with
a
continual
shower
of
witticisms
he
presented
to
the
prince
four
or
five
young
maidens
whom
he
dropped
on
without
ceremony
and
dragged
forward
they
ducked
and
shot
up
again
one
after
the
other
in
the
trailing
fluctuations
of
the
court
curtsey
set
their
teeth
and
did
their
best
klaus
heinrich
stood
with
his
heels
together
and
murmured
delighted
quite
delighted
to
one
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
it
a
jolly
ball
is
it
yes
grand
ducal
highness
we
are
having
great
fun
answered
she
in
a
high
chirping
voice
she
was
a
tall
rather
bony
bourgeoise
maiden
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
fair
wavy
hair
dressed
over
a
pad
and
a
pretty
face
a
gold
chain
round
her
bare
neck
the
of
which
showed
prominently
and
big
white
hands
in
mittens
she
added
the
quadrille
is
coming
next
will
your
grand
ducal
highness
dance
it
with
me
i
do
know
he
said
i
really
do
know
he
looked
round
the
machinery
of
the
ball
was
already
falling
into
geometrical
order
lines
were
being
drawn
squares
were
forming
couples
came
forward
and
called
to
the
music
had
not
yet
started
klaus
heinrich
asked
his
cousins
yes
they
were
taking
part
in
the
lancers
they
already
had
their
lucky
partners
on
their
arms
klaus
heinrich
was
seen
to
go
up
behind
his
mother
red
damask
chair
and
whisper
something
excitedly
to
her
whereupon
she
turned
her
lovely
neck
and
passed
on
the
question
to
her
husband
and
the
grand
duke
nodded
and
then
some
laughter
was
caused
by
the
youthful
impetuosity
with
which
the
prince
ran
down
so
as
not
to
miss
the
beginning
of
the
square
dance
the
reporter
of
the
notebook
in
one
hand
and
pencil
in
the
other
peered
with
neck
thrust
forward
over
the
hall
out
of
his
corner
so
as
to
make
sure
whom
the
prince
was
going
to
engage
it
was
the
fair
tall
girl
with
the
and
the
big
white
hands
fräulein
unschlitt
the
daughter
she
was
still
standing
where
klaus
heinrich
had
left
her
are
you
still
there
he
said
breathlessly
may
i
have
the
pleasure
come
along
the
sets
were
complete
they
wandered
about
for
a
while
without
finding
a
place
a
man
with
a
ribbon
rosette
hurried
up
seized
a
pair
of
young
people
by
the
shoulders
and
induced
them
to
leave
their
stand
under
the
chandelier
that
his
grand
ducal
highness
might
occupy
it
with
fräulein
unschlitt
the
band
had
been
hesitating
it
now
struck
up
the
prescribed
compliments
were
exchanged
and
klaus
heinrich
danced
like
the
rest
of
the
world
the
doors
into
the
next
room
stood
open
in
one
of
them
was
a
buffet
with
flower
vases
punch
bowls
and
dishes
of
cakes
the
dance
extended
right
into
this
room
two
sets
were
dancing
in
it
in
the
other
room
some
tables
were
arrayed
which
were
still
standing
empty
klaus
heinrich
stepped
forwards
and
backwards
laughed
to
the
others
stretched
out
his
hand
and
grasped
theirs
and
then
again
seized
his
partner
big
white
hand
put
his
right
arm
round
the
waist
and
revolved
with
her
on
their
particular
patch
while
he
kept
his
left
hand
which
also
wore
a
little
white
glove
on
his
hip
they
laughed
and
talked
as
they
danced
the
prince
made
mistakes
forgot
himself
upset
figures
and
lost
his
place
you
must
keep
me
straight
he
said
in
the
confusion
i
upsetting
everything
nudge
me
in
the
ribs
and
the
others
gradually
plucked
up
courage
and
set
him
right
ordered
him
laughingly
hither
and
thither
even
laid
their
hands
on
him
and
pushed
him
a
little
when
necessary
the
fair
damsel
with
the
was
particularly
zealous
in
pushing
him
about
the
spirits
of
the
dancers
rose
with
every
figure
their
movements
became
freer
their
calls
bolder
they
began
to
stamp
their
feet
and
to
prance
as
they
advanced
and
retired
while
they
held
each
other
hands
and
balanced
themselves
with
their
arms
klaus
heinrich
too
stamped
at
first
only
by
way
of
signal
but
soon
more
loudly
and
as
far
as
the
balancing
with
the
arms
was
concerned
the
fair
maiden
looked
after
that
when
they
advanced
together
also
every
time
she
danced
facing
him
she
made
an
exaggerated
scrape
before
him
which
much
increased
the
merriment
the
refreshment
room
was
full
of
chatter
and
babble
which
attracted
everybody
envious
glances
some
one
had
left
his
set
in
the
middle
of
the
dance
purloined
a
sandwich
from
the
buffet
and
was
now
chewing
away
proudly
as
he
swerved
and
stamped
to
the
amusement
of
the
rest
what
cheek
said
the
fair
maiden
they
do
stand
on
ceremony
and
the
idea
gave
her
no
peace
before
you
could
look
round
she
was
off
had
dashed
lightly
and
nimbly
between
the
lines
of
dancers
had
seized
a
sandwich
from
the
buffet
and
was
back
in
her
place
klaus
heinrich
was
the
one
who
applauded
her
most
heartily
his
left
hand
was
a
difficulty
and
so
he
managed
without
it
while
with
his
right
he
beat
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
doubled
up
with
laughter
then
he
became
quieter
and
rather
pale
he
was
struggling
with
himself
the
quadrille
was
nearing
its
end
what
he
meant
to
do
he
must
do
quickly
they
had
already
got
to
the
grand
chain
and
as
he
was
already
almost
too
late
he
did
what
he
had
been
struggling
with
himself
about
he
broke
away
ran
swiftly
through
the
dancers
with
muttered
apologies
when
he
collided
with
anybody
reached
the
buffet
seized
a
sandwich
rushed
back
and
came
sliding
into
his
set
that
was
not
all
he
put
the
sandwich
it
was
an
egg
and
sardine
one
to
the
lips
of
his
partner
the
damsel
with
the
big
white
hands
she
curtseyed
a
little
bit
into
it
bit
almost
half
off
without
using
her
hands
and
throwing
back
his
head
he
stuffed
the
rest
into
his
mouth
the
high
spirits
of
the
set
found
a
vent
in
the
grand
chain
which
was
just
beginning
right
round
the
hall
went
the
dancers
winding
in
and
out
and
stretching
out
their
hands
then
it
stopped
the
tide
turned
and
once
more
the
stream
went
round
laughing
and
chattering
with
mistakes
and
entanglements
and
hurriedly
rectified
complications
klaus
heinrich
pressed
the
hands
he
grasped
without
knowing
to
whom
they
belonged
he
laughed
and
his
chest
heaved
his
smoothly
parted
hair
was
ruffled
and
a
bit
fell
over
his
forehead
his
bulged
a
little
out
of
his
waistcoat
and
in
his
face
and
sparkling
eyes
was
that
look
of
tender
emotion
which
is
sometimes
the
expression
of
happiness
he
said
several
times
during
the
chain
what
awful
fun
what
glorious
fun
he
met
his
cousins
and
to
them
too
he
said
we
have
had
such
fun
in
our
set
over
there
then
came
the
clapping
and
au
revoirs
the
dance
was
over
klaus
heinrich
again
stood
facing
the
fair
maiden
with
the
and
when
the
music
changed
time
he
once
more
put
his
arm
round
her
tender
waist
and
away
they
danced
klaus
heinrich
did
not
steer
well
and
often
knocked
into
other
couples
because
he
kept
his
left
hand
planted
on
his
hip
but
he
brought
his
partner
somehow
or
other
to
the
entrance
to
the
refreshment
room
where
they
called
a
halt
and
refreshed
themselves
with
pineappleade
which
was
handed
to
them
by
the
waiters
they
sat
just
at
the
entrance
on
two
velvet
stools
drank
and
chatted
about
the
quadrille
the
ball
and
other
social
functions
in
which
the
fair
maiden
had
already
taken
part
that
winter
it
was
then
that
one
of
the
suite
major
von
platow
the
grand
came
up
to
klaus
heinrich
bowed
and
begged
leave
to
announce
that
their
royal
highnesses
were
now
going
he
had
been
charged
but
klaus
heinrich
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
wished
to
remain
in
so
emphatic
a
fashion
that
the
did
not
like
to
insist
upon
his
errand
the
prince
uttered
exclamations
of
an
almost
rebellious
regret
and
was
obviously
bitterly
grieved
at
the
idea
of
going
home
at
once
we
are
having
such
fun
he
said
stood
up
and
gripped
the
major
arm
gently
dear
major
von
platow
please
do
intercede
for
me
talk
to
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
do
anything
you
like
but
to
go
now
when
we
are
all
having
such
fun
together
i
sure
my
cousins
are
going
to
stay
the
major
looked
at
the
fair
maiden
with
the
big
white
hands
who
smiled
at
him
he
too
smiled
and
promised
to
do
his
best
this
little
scene
was
enacted
while
the
grand
duke
and
the
grand
duchess
were
already
taking
leave
of
the
city
dignitaries
at
the
entrance
into
the
town
park
immediately
afterwards
the
dancing
on
the
first
floor
began
again
the
ball
was
at
its
height
everything
official
had
gone
and
the
king
of
revelry
came
into
his
own
the
tables
in
the
adjoining
rooms
were
occupied
by
families
drinking
punch
and
eating
supper
youth
streamed
to
and
fro
sitting
excitedly
and
impatiently
on
the
edges
of
the
chairs
to
eat
a
mouthful
drink
a
glass
and
again
plunge
into
the
merry
throng
on
the
there
was
an
which
was
crowded
with
the
more
sedate
men
the
big
and
the
were
by
now
monopolized
by
the
dancers
the
was
filled
with
fifteen
or
sixteen
young
people
sons
and
daughters
of
the
city
among
them
klaus
heinrich
it
was
a
kind
of
private
ball
in
there
they
danced
to
the
music
which
floated
in
from
the
main
hall
doctor
ueberbein
the
prince
tutor
was
seen
there
for
a
minute
or
two
having
a
short
talk
with
his
pupil
he
was
heard
to
mention
watch
in
hand
herr
von
knobelsdorff
name
and
to
say
that
he
was
down
in
the
and
was
coming
back
to
take
the
prince
away
then
he
went
the
time
was
ten
and
while
he
sat
below
and
conversed
with
his
friends
over
a
tankard
of
beer
only
for
an
hour
or
perhaps
an
hour
and
a
half
not
more
those
dreadful
things
that
simply
incredible
scandal
happened
in
the
to
which
it
fell
to
him
to
put
a
stop
though
unfortunately
too
late
the
punch
provided
was
weak
it
contained
more
than
champagne
and
if
the
young
people
lost
their
equilibrium
it
was
more
the
intoxication
of
the
dance
than
of
the
wine
but
in
view
of
the
prince
character
and
the
solid
bourgeois
origin
of
the
rest
of
the
company
that
was
not
enough
to
explain
what
happened
another
a
peculiar
intoxication
was
a
factor
here
on
both
sides
the
peculiar
thing
was
that
klaus
heinrich
was
fully
conscious
of
each
separate
stage
in
this
intoxication
and
yet
had
not
the
power
or
the
will
to
shake
it
off
he
was
happy
he
felt
on
his
cheeks
the
same
glow
burning
as
he
saw
in
the
faces
of
the
others
and
as
his
eyes
dazed
by
a
soft
mist
travelled
about
the
room
and
rested
admiringly
on
one
fair
form
after
another
his
look
seemed
to
say
we
his
mouth
too
said
it
said
for
the
pure
joy
of
saying
them
sentences
in
which
a
we
occurred
shall
sit
down
shall
have
another
turn
shall
have
a
drink
shall
make
up
two
sets
it
was
especially
to
the
maiden
with
the
that
klaus
heinrich
made
remarks
with
a
we
in
them
he
had
quite
forgotten
his
left
hand
it
hung
down
he
felt
so
happy
that
it
did
not
worry
him
and
he
never
thought
of
hiding
it
many
saw
now
for
the
first
time
what
really
was
the
matter
with
it
and
looked
curiously
on
with
an
unconscious
grimace
at
the
thin
short
arm
in
the
sleeve
the
little
by
now
rather
dirty
white
kid
glove
which
covered
the
hand
but
as
klaus
heinrich
was
so
careless
about
it
the
others
plucked
up
courage
the
result
being
that
everybody
took
hold
of
the
malformed
hand
quite
unconcernedly
in
the
round
or
square
dances
he
did
not
keep
it
back
he
felt
himself
borne
along
nay
rather
whirled
around
by
a
feeling
a
strong
wild
feeling
of
contentment
that
grew
gathered
heat
from
itself
possessed
itself
of
him
more
and
more
recklessly
overpowered
him
even
more
vehemently
and
breathlessly
seemed
to
lift
him
triumphantly
from
the
floor
what
was
happening
it
was
difficult
to
say
difficult
to
be
quite
sure
the
air
was
full
of
words
detached
cries
not
spoken
but
expressed
on
the
dancers
faces
in
their
attitudes
in
all
they
were
doing
and
saying
he
must
just
once
bring
him
along
bring
him
along
caught
caught
a
young
damsel
with
a
nose
who
asked
him
for
a
gallop
when
the
dance
came
said
quite
clearly
without
any
obvious
connexion
chucker
up
as
she
got
ready
to
start
off
with
him
he
saw
pleasure
in
every
eye
and
saw
that
their
pleasure
lay
in
drawing
him
out
in
having
him
amongst
them
in
his
happiness
his
dream
to
be
with
them
amongst
them
one
of
them
there
obtruded
itself
from
time
to
time
a
cold
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
deluding
himself
that
the
warm
glorious
we
was
deceiving
him
that
he
did
not
really
blend
in
with
them
that
he
was
all
the
time
the
centre
and
object
of
the
show
but
in
a
different
and
more
unsatisfactory
way
than
before
they
were
his
enemies
to
a
certain
extent
he
saw
it
in
the
malice
of
their
eyes
he
heard
as
if
at
a
distance
with
a
peculiar
dismay
how
the
fair
damsel
with
the
big
white
hands
called
him
simply
by
his
names
and
he
felt
that
she
did
so
in
quite
a
different
spirit
to
that
of
doctor
ueberbein
when
he
did
the
same
she
had
the
right
and
the
permission
to
do
so
in
a
certain
manner
but
was
nobody
here
then
jealous
for
his
dignity
if
he
himself
was
not
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
plucked
at
his
coat
and
sometimes
in
their
excitement
made
wild
sneering
remarks
about
him
a
tall
fair
young
man
with
with
whom
he
collided
while
dancing
said
quite
loud
so
that
everybody
could
hear
it
now
then
clumsy
and
there
was
malice
in
the
way
in
which
the
fair
young
maiden
her
arm
in
his
and
a
grin
on
her
lips
whirled
round
with
him
till
he
was
ready
to
drop
with
giddiness
while
they
whirled
he
gazed
with
swimming
eyes
at
the
showing
under
the
white
rather
rough
skin
on
her
neck
they
fell
they
had
gone
too
hard
at
it
and
tumbled
when
they
tried
to
stop
revolving
and
over
them
stumbled
a
second
pair
not
entirely
by
themselves
but
rather
at
a
push
from
the
tall
young
man
with
there
was
a
scrimmage
on
the
floor
and
klaus
heinrich
heard
above
him
in
the
room
the
chorus
which
came
back
to
him
from
the
when
he
had
ventured
on
a
rather
daring
joke
by
way
of
amusing
his
fellows
a
ho
ho
ho
only
it
sounded
more
wicked
and
bolder
here
when
shortly
after
midnight
unfortunately
a
little
behind
time
doctor
ueberbein
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
this
is
what
he
saw
his
young
pupil
was
sitting
alone
on
the
green
plush
sofa
by
the
wall
his
clothes
all
disarranged
and
himself
decorated
in
an
extraordinary
way
a
quantity
of
flowers
which
had
previously
adorned
the
buffet
in
two
chinese
vases
were
stuck
in
the
opening
of
his
waistcoat
between
the
studs
of
his
shirtfront
even
in
his
collar
round
his
neck
lay
the
gold
chain
which
belonged
to
the
maiden
with
the
and
on
his
head
the
flat
metal
cover
of
a
was
balanced
like
a
hat
he
kept
saying
what
are
you
doing
what
are
you
doing
while
the
dancers
in
a
semicircle
danced
a
round
dance
backwards
and
forwards
in
front
of
him
with
giggles
whispers
smirks
and
ho
ho
ho
an
unusual
and
unnatural
flush
mantled
in
doctor
ueberbein
face
stop
it
stop
it
he
cried
in
his
resonant
voice
and
in
the
silence
consternation
and
dismay
which
at
once
ensued
he
walked
with
long
strides
up
to
the
prince
tore
away
the
flowers
in
two
or
three
grasps
threw
the
chain
and
the
cover
away
then
bowed
and
said
with
a
stern
look
may
i
beg
your
grand
ducal
highness
i
been
an
ass
an
ass
he
repeated
when
he
got
outside
klaus
heinrich
left
the
citizens
ball
in
his
company
that
was
the
painful
event
which
happened
during
klaus
heinrich
year
at
school
as
i
have
said
none
of
the
participators
talked
about
it
even
to
the
prince
doctor
ueberbein
did
not
mention
the
subject
for
years
afterwards
and
as
nobody
crystallized
the
event
in
words
it
remained
incorporeal
and
promptly
faded
away
at
least
apparently
into
oblivion
the
citizens
ball
had
taken
place
in
january
shrove
tuesday
with
the
court
ball
and
the
big
court
in
the
old
schloss
which
wound
up
the
social
year
regulation
festivities
to
which
klaus
heinrich
was
not
yet
admitted
were
past
and
over
then
came
easter
and
with
it
the
close
of
the
school
year
klaus
heinrich
diploma
examination
that
edifying
formality
in
the
course
of
which
the
question
you
agree
do
you
not
grand
ducal
highness
was
constantly
recurring
on
the
lips
of
the
professor
and
at
which
the
prince
acquitted
himself
admirably
in
his
very
conspicuous
position
this
was
not
a
very
important
phase
in
his
life
klaus
heinrich
continued
to
live
in
the
capital
but
after
whitsuntide
his
eighteenth
birthday
drew
near
and
with
it
a
complex
of
festivities
which
marked
a
serious
in
his
life
and
which
taxed
him
severely
for
days
together
he
had
attained
his
majority
had
been
pronounced
to
be
of
age
for
the
first
time
again
since
his
baptism
he
was
the
centre
of
attention
and
chief
actor
in
a
great
ceremony
but
while
he
had
then
quietly
irresponsibly
and
patiently
resigned
himself
to
the
formalities
which
surrounded
and
protected
him
it
was
incumbent
on
him
on
this
day
in
the
midst
of
binding
prescriptions
and
stern
regulations
hemmed
in
by
the
drapery
of
weighty
precedent
to
inspire
the
spectators
and
to
please
them
by
maintaining
an
attitude
of
dignity
and
and
at
the
same
time
to
appear
it
may
be
added
that
i
use
the
word
drapery
not
only
as
a
figure
of
speech
the
prince
wore
a
crimson
mantle
on
this
occasion
a
sumptuous
and
theatrical
article
of
raiment
which
his
father
and
grandfather
before
him
had
worn
at
their
and
which
notwithstanding
days
of
airing
still
smelt
of
camphor
the
crimson
mantle
had
originally
belonged
to
the
robes
of
the
knights
of
the
grimmburg
griffin
but
was
now
nothing
more
than
a
ceremonial
garb
for
the
use
of
princes
attaining
their
majority
albrecht
the
heir
apparent
had
never
worn
the
family
one
as
his
birthday
fell
in
the
winter
he
always
spent
it
in
the
south
in
a
place
with
a
warm
and
dry
climate
whither
he
was
thinking
of
returning
this
autumn
too
and
as
at
the
time
of
his
eighteenth
birthday
his
health
had
not
permitted
him
to
travel
home
it
had
been
decided
to
declare
him
officially
of
age
in
his
absence
and
to
dispense
with
the
court
ceremony
as
to
klaus
heinrich
there
was
only
one
opinion
especially
among
the
representatives
of
the
public
that
the
mantle
suited
him
admirably
and
he
himself
notwithstanding
the
way
in
which
it
hampered
his
movements
found
it
a
blessing
as
it
made
it
easy
for
him
to
hide
his
left
hand
between
the
canopied
bed
and
the
bellying
chest
of
drawers
in
his
bedroom
that
was
situated
on
the
second
floor
looking
out
on
the
yard
with
the
he
made
himself
ready
for
the
show
carefully
and
precisely
with
the
help
of
his
valet
neumann
a
quiet
and
precise
man
who
had
been
recently
attached
to
him
as
keeper
of
his
wardrobe
and
personal
servant
neumann
was
an
and
was
filled
especially
in
the
direction
of
his
original
calling
with
that
passionate
conscientiousness
that
insatiable
knowledge
of
the
ideal
which
gives
rise
to
the
highest
skill
he
did
not
shave
like
any
ordinary
shaver
he
was
not
content
to
leave
no
stubble
behind
he
shaved
in
such
a
way
that
every
shadow
of
a
beard
every
recollection
of
one
was
removed
and
without
hurting
the
skin
he
managed
to
restore
to
it
all
its
softness
and
smoothness
he
cut
klaus
heinrich
hair
exactly
square
above
the
ears
and
arranged
it
with
all
the
assiduity
required
in
his
opinion
by
this
preparation
for
the
prince
ceremonial
appearance
he
managed
that
the
parting
should
come
over
the
left
eye
and
run
slanting
back
over
the
crown
of
the
head
so
that
no
tufts
or
wisps
should
stick
up
on
it
he
brushed
the
hair
on
the
right
side
up
from
the
forehead
into
a
prim
crest
on
which
no
hat
or
helmet
could
make
an
impression
then
klaus
heinrich
with
his
help
squeezed
himself
carefully
into
his
uniform
of
lieutenant
in
the
grenadier
guards
whose
collar
and
tight
fit
favoured
a
dignified
bearing
put
on
the
silk
band
and
the
flat
gold
chain
of
the
house
order
and
went
down
to
the
picture
gallery
where
the
members
of
the
family
and
the
foreign
relations
of
the
grand
ducal
pair
were
waiting
the
court
was
waiting
in
the
adjoining
hall
of
the
knights
and
it
was
there
that
johann
albrecht
himself
invested
his
son
with
the
crimson
mantle
herr
von
bühl
zu
bühl
had
marshalled
a
procession
the
ceremonial
procession
from
the
hall
of
the
knights
to
the
it
had
cost
him
no
little
worry
the
composition
of
the
court
made
it
difficult
to
contrive
an
impressive
arrangement
and
herr
von
bühl
especially
lamented
the
lack
of
upper
court
officials
which
on
such
occasions
made
itself
most
severely
felt
the
royal
mews
had
recently
been
put
under
herr
von
bühl
and
he
felt
himself
quite
up
to
his
various
functions
but
he
asked
everybody
how
he
could
be
expected
to
make
a
good
impression
when
the
most
important
posts
were
filled
simply
by
the
master
of
the
von
stieglitz
and
the
director
of
the
grand
ducal
theatre
a
gouty
general
while
he
in
his
capacity
as
lord
marshal
chief
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
house
marshal
in
his
embroidered
clothes
and
brown
toupée
covered
with
orders
and
with
his
golden
on
his
nose
came
waddling
and
planting
his
long
staff
in
front
of
him
behind
the
cadets
who
dressed
as
pages
and
their
hair
parted
over
the
left
eye
opened
the
procession
he
pondered
deeply
over
what
came
behind
him
a
few
chamberlains
not
many
for
some
were
wanted
for
the
end
of
the
procession
their
plumed
hats
under
their
arms
and
the
key
on
their
followed
close
at
his
heels
in
silk
stockings
next
came
herr
von
stieglitz
and
the
limping
in
front
of
klaus
heinrich
who
in
his
mantle
between
the
exalted
couple
and
followed
by
his
brother
and
sister
albrecht
and
ditlinde
formed
the
actual
nucleus
of
the
procession
behind
their
highnesses
came
von
knobelsdorff
the
house
minister
and
president
of
council
his
all
at
work
a
little
knot
of
and
palace
ladies
came
next
general
count
schmettern
and
major
von
platow
a
count
trümmerhauff
cousin
of
the
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
as
military
of
the

apparent
and
the

led
by

followed
attended
and
followed
by
chamberlains
and
court
ladies
princess
catherine
with
her
progeny
prince
lambert
with
his
lovely
wife
and
the
foreign
relations
or
their
representatives
pages
brought
up
the
rear
thus
they
went
at
a
measured
pace
from
the
hall
of
the
knights
through
the
gala
halls
the
hall
of
the
twelve
months
and
the
marble
hall
into
the
lackeys
with
aiguillettes
on
their
brown
coats
stood
theatrically
in
couples
at
the
open
double
doors
through
the
broad
windows
the
june
morning
sun
streamed
gaily
and
recklessly
in
klaus
heinrich
looked
round
him
as
he
processed
between
his
parents
through
the
dreary
arabesques
the
dilapidated
decorations
of
the
now
not
favoured
by
kindly
artificial
light
the
bright
daylight
cheerfully
and
soberly
showed
up
their
decay
from
the
big
lustres
with
their
stems
stripped
of
their
coverings
in
honour
of
the
day
rose
thick
forests
of
flameless
candles
but
everywhere
there
were
prisms
missing
crystal
festoons
torn
so
that
they
gave
a
and
toothless
impression
the
silk
damask
upholstery
of
the
state
furniture
which
was
arranged
stiffly
and
monotonously
round
the
walls
was
the
gilt
of
the
frames
chipped
off
big
blind
patches
marred
the
surfaces
of
the
tall
mirrors
and
daylight
shone
through
the
in
the
faded
and
discoloured
curtains
the
gold
and
silver
borders
of
the
tapestry
hangings
had
torn
away
in
several
places
and
were
hanging
disconsolately
from
the
walls
even
in
the
silver
hall
of
the
gala
rooms
where
the
grand
duke
was
wont
to
receive
solemn
deputations
and
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
table
with
stumpy
silver
feet
a
piece
of
the
silver
work
had
fallen
from
the
ceiling
leaving
a
gaping
patch
of
white
plaster
but
why
was
it
that
it
somehow
seemed
as
if
these
rooms
defied
the
sober
mocking
daylight
and
proudly
answered
its
challenge
klaus
heinrich
looked
sideways
at
his
father
the
condition
of
the
rooms
did
not
seem
to
worry
him
never
of
more
than
medium
height
the
grand
duke
had
become
almost
small
in
the
course
of
years
but
he
strode
majestically
on
with
head
thrown
back
the
ribbon
of
the
order
over
his
general
uniform
which
he
had
donned
though
he
had
no
military
leanings
from
under
his
high
and
bald
forehead
and
grey
eyebrows
his
blue
eyes
with
dull
rings
round
them
were
fixed
with
weary
dignity
on
the
distance
and
from
his
pointed
white
moustaches
the
two
deep
furrows
ran
down
his
yellowish
skin
to
his
beard
imparting
to
his
face
a
look
of
contempt
no
the
bright
daylight
could
not
do
any
harm
to
the
rooms
the
dilapidations
did
not
in
the
least
impair
their
dignity
they
rather
increased
it
they
stood
in
their
discomfort
their
theatrical
symmetry
their
strange
musty
or
church
atmosphere
cold
and
indifferent
to
the
merry
and
world
outside
stern
background
of
a
pompous
cult
at
which
klaus
heinrich
this
day
for
the
first
time
officiated
the
procession
passed
through
the
pairs
of
lackeys
who
with
an
expression
of
relentlessness
pressed
their
lips
together
and
closed
their
eyes
into
the
white
and
gold
expanse
of
the
a
wave
of
acts
of
homage
scrapings
bows
curtseys
and
salutes
swept
through
the
hall
as
the
procession
passed
in
front
of
the
assembled
guests
there
were
diplomats
with
their
wives
nobility
of
the
court
and
the
country
the
corps
of
officers
of
the
capital
the
ministers
amongst
whom
could
be
descried
the
affected
confident
face
of
the
new
finance
minister
krippenreuther
the
knights
of
the
great
order
of
the
grimmburg
griffin
the
presidents
of
the
diet
dignitaries
of
all
kinds
high
up
in
the
little
box
above
the
big
by
the
entrance
door
could
be
descried
the
press
representatives
peering
over
each
other
shoulders
and
busily
writing
in
their
notebooks
in
front
of
the
itself
a
torn
velvet
arrangement
crowned
with
ostrich
feathers
and
framed
with
gold
fillets
which
would
have
been
all
the
better
for
a
the
procession
divided
as
in
a
polonaise
and
went
through
carefully
prescribed
evolutions
the
pages
and
chamberlains
fell
aside
to
right
and
left
herr
von
bühl
his
face
turned
to
the
throne
and
his
staff
uplifted
stepped
backwards
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
the
grand
ducal
pair
and
their
children
walked
up
the
rounded
steps
to
the
capacious
gilded
chairs
which
stood
at
the
top
the
remaining
members
of
the
house
with
the
foreign
princes
ranged
themselves
on
both
sides
of
the
throne
behind
them
stood
the
suite
the
maids
of
honour
and
the
grooms
of
the
chambers
and
the
pages
stood
on
the
steps
at
a
gesture
from
johann
albrecht
herr
von
knobelsdorff
who
had
previously
taken
up
his
stand
over
against
the
throne
advanced
straight
to
the
table
which
stood
by
the
side
of
the
steps
and
began
at
once
to
read
from
various
documents
the
official
formalities
klaus
heinrich
was
declared
to
be
of
age
and
fit
and
entitled
to
wear
the
crown
should
necessity
require
it
every
eye
was
turned
on
him
at
this
place
and
at
his
royal
highness
albrecht
his
elder
brother
who
stood
close
to
him
the
heir
apparent
was
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
captain
in
the
hussar
regiment
which
was
called
by
his
name
from
his
collar
stretched
an
unmilitary
width
of
civil
collar
and
on
it
rested
his
fine
shrewd
and
delicate
head
with
its
long
skull
and
narrow
temples
the
moustache
on
the
upper
lip
and
the
blue
eyes
which
had
seen
death
he
looked
not
in
the
least
like
a
cavalry
officer
yet
so
slender
and
unapproachably
aristocratic
that
klaus
heinrich
with
his
national
looked
almost
coarse
beside
him
the
heir
apparent
pursed
up
his
lips
when
everybody
looked
at
him
protruded
his
short
rounded
underlip
and
sucked
it
lightly
against
the
upper
one
several
of
the
country
orders
were
bestowed
on
the
prince
who
had
just
come
of
age
including
the
albrecht
cross
and
the
great
order
of
the
grimmburg
griffin
not
to
mention
that
he
was
confirmed
in
the
house
order
whose
insignia
he
had
possessed
since
his
tenth
birthday
afterwards
came
the
congratulations
in
the
form
of
a
processional
court
led
by
the
fawning
herr
von
bühl
after
which
the
began
in
the
marble
hall
and
in
the
hall
of
the
twelve
months

foreign

were
entertained

actually
published
a
printed
likeness
of
him
a
popular
and
strangely
idealized
representation
showing
the
prince
in
the
crimson
mantle
but
then
came
yet
another
great
day
klaus
formal
entry
into
the
army
into
the
regiment
of
grenadier
guards
this
is
what
happened
the
regiment
to
which
fell
the
honour
of
having
klaus
heinrich
as
one
of
its
officers
was
drawn
up
on
the
albrechtsplatz
in
open
square
many
a
plume
waved
in
the
middle
the
princes
of
the
house
and
the
generals
were
all
present
the
public
a
black
mass
against
the
gay
background
crowded
behind
the
barriers
cameras
were
levelled
in
several
places
at
the
scene
of
action
the
grand
duchess
with
the
princesses
and
their
ladies
watched
the
show
from
the
windows
of
the
old
schloss
first
of
all
klaus
heinrich
dressed
as
a
lieutenant
reported
himself
formally
to
the
grand
duke
he
advanced
sternly
without
the
shadow
of
a
smile
towards
his
father
clapped
his
heels
together
and
humbly
acquainted
him
with
his
presence
the
grand
duke
thanked
him
briefly
also
without
a
smile
and
then
in
his
turn
followed
by
his
advanced
in
his
dress
uniform
and
plumed
hat
into
the
square
klaus
heinrich
stood
before
the
lowered
colours
an
embroidered
golden
and
piece
of
silk
cloth
and
took
the
oath
the
grand
duke
made
a
speech
in
detached
sentences
and
the
sharp
voice
of
command
which
he
reserved
for
such
occasions
in
which
he
called
his
son
your
grand
ducal
highness
and
publicly
clasped
the
prince
hand
the
colonel
of
the
grenadier
guards
with
crimson
cheeks
led
a
cheer
for
the
grand
duke
in
which
the
guests
the
regiment
and
the
public
joined
a
march
past
followed
and
the
whole
ended
with
a
military
luncheon
in
the
castle
this
picturesque
ceremony
in
the
albrechtsplatz
was
without
practical
significance
its
effect
began
and
ended
there
klaus
heinrich
never
dreamed
of
going
into
garrison
but
went
the
very
same
day
with
his
parents
and
brother
and
sister
to
hollerbrunn
to
pass
the
summer
there
in
the
cool
old
french
rooms
on
the
river
between
the
hedges
of
the
park
and
then
in
the
autumn
to
go
up
to
the
university
for
so
it
was
ordained
in
the
programme
of
his
life
in
the
autumn
he
went
up
to
the
university
for
a
year
not
that
of
the
capital
but
the
second
one
of
the
country
accompanied
by
doctor
ueberbein
his
tutor
the
appointment
of
this
young
savant
as
mentor
was
once
more
attributable
to
an
express
ardent
wish
of
the
prince
and
indeed
as
far
as
the
choice
of
tutor
and
older
companions
was
concerned
whom
klaus
heinrich
was
to
have
at
his
side
during
this
year
of
student
freedom
it
was
considered
necessary
to
give
a
reasonable
amount
of
consideration
to
his
expressed
wishes
yet
there
was
much
to
be
said
against
this
choice
it
was
unpopular
or
at
least
criticized
aloud
or
in
whispers
in
many
quarters
raoul
ueberbein
was
not
loved
in
the
capital
due
respect
was
paid
to
his
medal
for
and
to
all
his
feverish
energy
but
the
man
was
no
genial
no
jolly
comrade
no
blameless
official
the
most
charitable
saw
in
him
an
oddity
with
a
determined
and
uncomfortably
reckless
disposition
who
recognized
no
sunday
no
holiday
no
relaxation
and
did
not
understand
being
a
man
amongst
men
after
work
was
done
this
natural
son
of
an
adventuress
had
worked
his
way
up
from
the
depths
of
society
from
an
obscure
and
prospectless
youth
without
means
by
dint
of
sheer
strength
of
will
to
being
first
school
teacher
then
academic
professor
then
university
lecturer
had
lived
to
see
his
appointment
had
engineered
it
as
many
said
to
the
pheasantry
as
teacher
of
a
grand
ducal
prince
and
yet
he
knew
no
rest
no
contentment
no
comfortable
enjoyment
of
life
but
life
as
every
decent
man
thinking
of
doctor
ueberbein
truly
observed
life
does
not
consist
only
of
profession
and
performance
it
has
its
purely
human
claims
and
duties
the
neglect
of
which
is
a
greater
sin
than
the
display
of
some
measure
of
joviality
towards
oneself
and
one
fellows
in
the
sphere
of
one
work
and
only
that
personality
can
be
considered
a
harmonious
one
which
succeeds
in
giving
its
due
to
each
part
profession
and
human
feelings
life
and
performance
ueberbein
lack
of
any
sense
of
camaraderie
was
bound
to
tell
against
him
he
avoided
all
social
intercourse
with
his
colleagues
and
his
circle
of
friends
was
confined
to
the
person
of
one
man
of
another
scientific
sphere
a
surgeon
and
children
specialist
with
the
unsympathetic
name
of
sammet
a
very
popular
surgeon
to
boot
who
shared
certain
characteristics
with
ueberbein
but
it
was
only
very
rarely
and
then
only
as
a
sort
of
favour
that
he
turned
up
at
the
club
where
the
teachers
gathered
after
the
day
work
and
worry
for
a
glass
of
beer
a
rubber
or
a
free
exchange
of
views
on
public
and
personal
questions
but
he
passed
his
evenings
and
as
his
landlady
reported
also
a
great
part
of
the
night
working
at
science
in
his
study
while
his
complexion
grew
greener
and
greener
and
his
eyes
showed
more
and
more
clearly
signs
of
overstrain
the
authorities
had
been
moved
shortly
after
his
return
from
the
pheasantry
to
promote
him
to
head
master
where
was
he
going
to
stop
at
director
professor
minister
for
education
everybody
agreed
that
his
immoderate
and
restless
energy
concealed
imprudence
and
defiance
of
public
opinion
or
rather
did
not
conceal
them
his
demeanour
his
loud
blustering
mode
of
speaking
annoyed
irritated
and
exasperated
people
his
tone
towards
members
of
the
teaching
profession
who
were
older
and
in
higher
positions
than
himself
was
not
what
it
should
be
he
treated
everybody
from
the
director
down
to
the
humblest
usher
in
a
fatherly
way
and
his
habit
of
talking
of
himself
as
of
a
man
who
had
knocked
about
of
gassing
about
fate
and
duty
and
thereby
displaying
his
benevolent
contempt
for
all
those
who
obliged
to
and
smoked
cigars
in
the
morning
showed
conceit
pure
and
simple
his
pupils
adored
him
he
achieved
remarkable
results
with
them
that
was
agreed
but
on
the
whole
the
doctor
had
many
enemies
in
the
town
more
than
he
ever
guessed
and
the
misgiving
that
his
influence
on
the
prince
might
be
an
undesirable
one
was
put
into
words
in
at
least
one
portion
of
the
daily
press
anyhow
ueberbein
obtained
leave
from
the
latin
school
and
went
first
of
all
alone
in
the
capacity
of
billeter
on
a
visit
to
the
famous
student
town
within
whose
walls
klaus
heinrich
was
destined
to
pass
the
year
of
his
apprenticeship
and
on
his
return
he
was
received
in
audience
by
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
the
minister
of
the
grand
ducal
house
to
receive
the
usual
instructions
their
tenour
was
that
almost
the
most
important
object
of
this
year
was
to
establish
traditions
of
comradeship
on
the
common
ground
of
academic
freedom
between
the
prince
and
the
student
corps
especially
in
the
interests
of
the
dynasty
the
regulation
phrases
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
rattled
off
almost
casually
and
which
doctor
ueberbein
listened
to
with
a
silent
bow
while
he
drew
his
mouth
and
with
it
his
red
beard
a
little
to
one
side
then
followed
klaus
heinrich
departure
with
his
mentor
a
dogcart
and
a
servant
or
two
for
the
university
a
glorious
year
full
of
the
charm
of
artistic
freedom
in
the
public
eye
and
in
the
mirror
of
public
report
yet
without
technical
importance
of
any
kind
misgivings
which
had
been
felt
in
some
quarters
that
doctor
ueberbein
through
mistaking
and
misunderstanding
the
position
might
worry
the
prince
with
excessive
demands
in
the
direction
of
objective
science
proved
unfounded
on
the
contrary
it
was
obvious
that
the
doctor
quite
realized
the
difference
between
his
own
earnest
and
his
pupil
exalted
sphere
of
existence
on
the
other
hand
whether
it
was
the
mentor
or
the
prince
own
fault
does
not
matter
the
freedom
and
the
unconstrained
camaraderie
like
the
instruction
were
interpreted
in
a
very
relative
and
symbolical
sense
so
that
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
neither
the
knowledge
nor
the
freedom
could
be
said
to
be
the
essence
and
peculiarity
of
the
year
its
essence
and
peculiarity
were
rather
as
it
appeared
the
year
in
itself
as
the
embodiment
of
custom
and
impressive
ceremoniousness
to
which
klaus
heinrich
deferred
just
as
he
had
deferred
to
the
theatrical
rites
on
his
last
birthday
only
now
not
with
a
purple
cloak
but
occasionally
wearing
a
coloured
student
cap
the
stürmer
in
which
he
was
portrayed
in
a
photograph
issued
at
once
by
the
to
its
readers
as
to
his
studies
his
matriculation
was
not
marked
by
any
particular
festivities
though
some
reference
was
made
to
the
honour
which
klaus
heinrich
admission
bestowed
on
the
university
and
the
lectures
he
attended
began
with
the
address
grand
ducal
highness
he
drove
in
his
dogcart
with
a
groom
from
the
pretty
villa
which
the
marshal
of
his
father
household
had
leased
for
him
in
a
select
and
not
too
expensive
square
amid
the
remarks
and
greetings
of
the
to
the
lectures
and
there
he
sat
with
the
consciousness
that
the
whole
thing
was
unessential
and
unnecessary
for
his
exalted
calling
yet
with
a
show
of
courteous
attention
charming
anecdotes
of
the
signs
the
prince
gave
of
interest
in
the
lectures
went
about
and
had
their
due
effect
towards
the
end
of
one
course
on
nature
study
for
klaus
heinrich
attended
these
courses
also
for
general
information
the
professor
by
way
of
illustration
had
filled
a
metal
shell
with
water
and
announced
that
the
water
when
frozen
would
burst
the
shell
by
expansion
he
promised
to
show
the
class
the
pieces
next
lecture
now
he
had
not
kept
his
word
on
this
point
at
the
next
lecture
probably
out
of
forgetfulness
the
broken
shell
had
not
been
forthcoming
klaus
heinrich
had
therefore
inquired
as
to
the
result
of
the
experiment
he
had
joined
in
asking
questions
of
the
professor
at
the
end
of
the
lecture
just
like
any
ordinary
student
and
had
modestly
asked
him
has
the
bomb
burst
whereupon
the
professor
full
of
embarrassment
at
first
had
then
expressed
his
thanks
with
glad
surprise
and
indeed
emotion
for
the
kind
interest
the
prince
had
expressed
in
his
lectures
klaus
heinrich
was
honorary
member
of
a
student
club
only
honorary
because
he
was
not
allowed
to
fight
duels
and
once
or
twice
attended
their
wines
his
stürmer
on
his
head
but
since
his
guardians
were
well
aware
that
the
results
the
influence
of
strong
drink
had
on
his
highly
strung
and
delicate
temperament
were
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
his
exalted
calling
he
did
not
dare
to
drink
seriously
and
his
comrades
were
obliged
on
this
point
too
to
bear
his
highness
in
mind
their
rude
customs
were
judiciously
limited
to
a
casual
one
or
two
the
general
tone
was
as
exemplary
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
upper
form
at
school
the
songs
they
sang
were
old
ones
of
real
poetry
and
the
meetings
were
as
a
whole
gala
and
parade
nights
refined
editions
of
the
ordinary
ones
the
use
of
christian
names
was
the
bond
of
union
between
klaus
heinrich
and
his
corps
brothers
as
the
expression
and
basis
of
spontaneous
comradeship
but
it
was
generally
observed
that
this
use
sounded
false
and
artificial
however
great
the
efforts
to
make
it
otherwise
and
that
the
students
were
always
falling
back
unintentionally
into
the
form
of
address
which
took
due
notice
of
the
prince
highness
such
was
the
effect
of
his
presence
of
his
friendly
alert
and
always
uncompromising
attitude
which
sometimes
produced
strange
even
comical
phenomena
in
the
demeanour
of
the
persons
with
whom
the
prince
came
into
contact
one
evening
at
a
soirée
which
one
of
his
professors
gave
he
engaged
a
guest
in
conversation
a
fat
man
of
some
age
a
king
counsel
by
his
title
who
despite
his
social
importance
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
a
great
roué
and
a
regular
old
sinner
the
conversation
whose
subject
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
and
indeed
would
be
difficult
to
specify
lasted
for
a
considerable
time
because
no
opportunity
of
breaking
it
off
presented
itself
and
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
his
talk
with
the
prince
the
barrister
whistled
whistled
with
his
thick
lips
one
of
those
pointless
sequences
of
notes
which
one
utters
when
one
is
embarrassed
and
wants
to
appear
at
one
ease
and
then
tried
to
cover
his
comic
breach
of
manners
by
clearing
his
throat
and
coughing
klaus
heinrich
was
accustomed
to
experiences
of
that
kind
and
tactfully
passed
on
if
at
any
time
he
wanted
to
make
a
purchase
himself
and
went
into
a
shop
his
entrance
caused
a
kind
of
panic
he
would
ask
for
what
he
wanted
a
button
perhaps
but
the
girl
would
not
understand
him
would
look
dazed
and
unable
to
fix
her
attention
on
the
button
but
obviously
absorbed
by
something
else
something
outside
and
above
her
duties
as
a
she
would
drop
a
few
things
turn
the
boxes
upside
down
in
obvious
helplessness
and
it
was
all
klaus
heinrich
could
do
to
restore
her
composure
by
his
friendly
manner
such
as
i
have
said
was
the
effect
of
his
attitude
and
in
the
city
it
was
often
described
as
arrogance
and
blameworthy
contempt
for
others
roundly
denied
the
arrogance
and
doctor
ueberbein
when
the
subject
was
broached
to
him
at
a
social
gathering
would
put
the
question
whether
every
inducement
to
contempt
for
his
being
readily
conceded
any
such
contempt
really
was
possible
in
a
case
like
the
present
of
complete
detachment
from
all
the
activities
of
ordinary
men
indeed
any
remark
of
that
kind
he
met
in
his
unanswerable
blustering
way
by
the
assertion
that
the
prince
not
only
did
not
despise
his
but
respected
even
the
most
worthless
of
them
only
considered
them
all
the
more
sound
serious
and
good
for
the
way
in
which
the
poor
and
man
in
the
street
earned
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
the
society
of
the
university
town
had
no
time
to
reach
a
definite
verdict
on
the
question
the
year
of
student
life
was
over
before
one
could
turn
round
and
klaus
heinrich
returned
as
prescribed
by
the
programme
of
his
life
to
his
father
palace
there
despite
his
left
arm
to
pass
a
full
year
in
serious
military
service
he
was
attached
to
the
dragoons
of
the
guard
for
six
months
and
directed
the
taking
up
of
intervals
of
eight
paces
for
as
well
as
the
forming
of
squares
as
if
he
were
a
serious
soldier
then
changed
his
weapon
and
transferred
to
the
grenadier
guards
so
as
to
get
an
insight
into
infantry
work
also
it
fell
to
him
to
march
to
the
schloss
and
change
the
guard
an
evolution
which
attracted
large
crowds
he
came
swiftly
out
of
the
his
star
on
his
breast
placed
himself
with
drawn
sword
on
the
flank
of
the
company
and
gave
not
quite
correct
orders
which
however
did
not
matter
as
his
stout
soldiers
executed
the
right
movements
all
the
same
on
too
at
he
sat
on
the
colonel
right
hand
and
by
his
presence
prevented
the
officers
from
unhooking
their
uniform
collars
and
playing
cards
after
dinner
after
this
being
now
twenty
years
old
he
started
on
an
educational
tour
no
longer
in
the
company
of
doctor
ueberbein
but
in
that
of
a
military
attendant
and
courier
captain
von
of
the
guards
a
officer
who
was
destined
to
be
klaus
heinrich
and
to
whom
the
tour
gave
an
opportunity
of
establishing
himself
on
a
footing
of
intimacy
and
influence
with
him
klaus
heinrich
did
not
see
much
in
his
educational
tour
which
took
him
far
afield
and
was
keenly
followed
by
the
he
visited
the
courts
introduced
himself
to
the
sovereigns
attended
gala
dinners
with
captain
von
braunbart
and
on
his
departure
received
one
of
the
country
superior
orders
he
took
a
look
at
such
sights
as
captain
von
braunbart
who
also
received
several
orders
chose
for
him
and
the
reported
from
time
to
time
that
the
prince
had
expressed
his
admiration
of
a
picture
a
museum
or
a
building
to
the
director
or
curator
who
happened
to
be
his
cicerone
he
travelled
apart
protected
and
supported
by
the
chivalrous
precautions
of
captain
von
braunbart
who
kept
the
purse
and
to
whose
devoted
zeal
was
due
the
fact
that
not
one
of
klaus
heinrich
trunks
was
missing
at
the
end
of
the
journey
a
couple
of
words
no
more
may
be
devoted
to
an
interlude
which
had
for
scene
a
big
city
in
a
neighbouring
kingdom
and
was
brought
about
by
captain
von
braunbart
with
all
due
circumspection
the
captain
had
a
friend
in
this
city
a
bachelor
nobleman
and
a
cavalry
captain
who
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
a
young
lady
member
of
the
theatrical
world
an
accommodating
and
at
the
same
time
trustworthy
young
person
in
pursuance
of
an
agreement
by
letter
between
captain
von
braunbart
and
his
friend
klaus
heinrich
was
thrown
in
contact
with
the
damsel
at
her
home
suitably
arranged
for
the
purpose
and
the
acquaintance
allowed
to
develop
thus
an
expressly
foreseen
item
in
the
educational
tour
was
conscientiously
realized
without
klaus
heinrich
being
involved
in
more
than
a
casual
acquaintance
the
damsel
received
a
memento
for
her
services
and
captain
von
braunbart
friend
a
decoration
so
the
incident
closed
klaus
heinrich
also
visited
the
fair
southern
lands
incognito
under
a
title
there
he
would
sit
alone
perhaps
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
dressed
in
a
suit
of
irreproachable
cut
among
other
foreigners
on
a
white
restaurant
terrace
looking
over
a
sea
and
it
might
happen
that
somebody
at
another
table
would
notice
him
and
try
in
the
manner
of
tourists
to
engage
him
in
conversation
what
could
he
be
that
quiet
and
young
man
people
ran
over
the
various
spheres
of
life
tried
to
fit
him
into
the
merchant
the
military
the
student
class
but
they
never
felt
that
they
had
got
it
quite
right
they
felt
his
highness
but
nobody
guessed
it
v
albrecht
ii
grand
duke
johann
albrecht
died
of
a
terrible
illness
which
had
something
naked
and
abstract
about
it
and
to
which
no
other
name
but
just
that
of
death
could
be
given
it
seemed
as
if
death
sure
of
its
prey
in
this
case
disdained
any
mask
or
gloss
and
came
on
the
scene
as
its
very
self
as
dissolution
by
and
for
itself
what
actually
happened
was
a
decomposition
of
the
blood
caused
by
internal
hæmorrhages
and
an
exploratory
operation
which
was
conducted
by
the
director
of
the
university
hospital
a
famous
surgeon
could
not
arrest
the
corroding
progress
of
the
gangrene
the
end
soon
came
all
the
sooner
that
johann
albrecht
made
little
resistance
to
the
approach
of
death
he
showed
signs
of
an
unutterable
weariness
and
often
remarked
to
his
attendants
as
well
as
to
the
surgeons
attending
him
that
he
was
dead
sick
of
the
whole
thing
meaning
of
course
his
princely
existence
his
exalted
life
in
the
glare
of
publicity
his
those
two
lines
of
arrogance
and
boredom
resolved
in
his
last
days
into
an
exaggerated
grotesque
grimace
and
continued
thus
until
death
smoothed
them
out
the
grand
duke
illness
fell
in
the
winter
albrecht
the
heir
apparent
called
away
from
his
warm
dry
resort
arrived
in
snowy
wet
weather
which
was
as
bad
for
his
health
as
it
could
be
his
brother
klaus
heinrich
interrupted
his
educational
tour
which
was
anyhow
nearing
its
close
and
returned
with
captain
von
in
all
haste
from
the
fair
land
of
the
south
to
the
capital
besides
the
two
the
grand

without
his

the
ghostly
noise
in

chamber
had
been
exceptionally
loud
in
the
last
weeks
and
days

and

noise

recurred
periodically

johann
albrecht
last
act
of
highness
consisted
in
giving
with
his
own
hand
to
the
professor
who
had
performed
the
useless
operation
with
the
greatest
skill
his
patent
of
nomination
to
the
privy
council
he
was
terribly
exhausted
sick
of
the
whole
thing
and
his
consciousness
even
in
his
more
lucid
moments
was
not
at
all
clear
but
he
carried
out
the
act
with
scrupulous
care
and
made
a
ceremony
of
it
he
had
himself
propped
up
made
a
few
alterations
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
in
the
chance
disposition
of
those
present
ordered
his
sons
to
place
themselves
on
both
sides
of
his
canopied
bed
and
while
his
soul
was
already
tugging
at
her
moorings
and
floating
here
and
there
on
unknown
currents
he
composed
his
features
with
mechanical
skill
into
his
smile
of
graciousness
for
the
handing
of
the
diploma
to
the
professor
who
had
left
the
room
for
a
short
time
quite
towards
the
end
when
the
dissolution
had
already
attacked
the
brain
the
grand
duke
made
one
wish
clear
which
though
scarcely
understood
was
hastily
complied
with
although
its
fulfilment
could
not
do
the
slightest
good
to
the
grand
duke
certain
words
apparently
disconnected
kept
recurring
in
the
murmurings
of
the
sick
man
he
named
several
stuffs
silk
satin
and
brocade
mentioned
prince
klaus
heinrich
used
a
technical
expression
in
medicine
and
said
something
about
an
order
the
albrecht
cross
of
the
third
class
with
crown
between
whiles
one
caught
quite
ordinary
remarks
which
apparently
referred
to
the
dying
man
princely
calling
and
sounded
like
extraordinary
obligation
and
comfortable
majority
then
the
descriptions
of
the
stuffs
began
again
to
which
was
appended
in
a
louder
voice
the
word
sammet
at
last
it
was
realized
that
the
grand
duke
wanted
doctor
sammet
to
be
called
in
the
doctor
who
had
happened
to
be
present
at
the
grimmburg
at
the
time
of
klaus
birth
twenty
years
before
and
had
for
a
long
time
now
been
practising
in
the
capital
velvet
the
doctor
was
really
a
children
doctor
but
he
was
summoned
and
came
already
nearly
grey
on
the
temples
with
a
drooping
moustache
surmounted
by
a
nose
which
was
rather
too
flat
at
the
bottom
otherwise
and
with
cheeks
rather
sore
from
shaving
with
head
on
one
side
his
hand
on
his
and
elbows
close
to
his
sides
he
examined
the
situation
and
began
at
once
to
busy
himself
in
a
practical
gentle
way
about
his
exalted
patient
whereat
the
latter
expressed
his
satisfaction
in
no
uncertain
fashion
thus
it
was
that
it
fell
to
doctor
sammet
to
administer
the
last
injections
to
the
grand
duke
with
his
supporting
hand
to
ease
the
final
spasms
and
to
be
more
than
any
of
the
other
doctors
his
helper
in
death
a
distinction
which
indeed
provoked
some
secret
irritation
amongst
the
others
but
on
the
other
hand
resulted
in
the
doctor
appointment
shortly
afterwards
to
the
vacancy
in
the
important
post
of
director
and
chief
physician
of
the
dorothea
a
children
hospital
in
which
capacity
he
was
destined
later
to
play
some
part
in
certain
developments
so
died
johann
albrecht
the
third
uttering
his
last
sigh
on
a
night
the
old
castle
was
brightly
illuminated
while
he
was
passing
away
the
stern
furrows
of
boredom
were
smoothed
out
in
his
face
and
relieved
of
any
exertion
on
his
own
part
he
was
subjected
to
formalities
which
surrounded
him
for
the
last
time
carried
him
along
and
made
his
shell
just
once
more
the
focus
and
object
of
theatrical
rites
herr
von
bühl
zu

showed
his
usual
energy
in
organizing
the
funeral
which
was
attended
by
many
princely
guests
the
gloomy
ceremonies
the
different
exposures
and
identifications
blessings
and
memorial
services
at
the
catafalque
took
days
to
complete
and
johann
albrecht
corpse
was
for
eight
hours
exposed
to
public
view
surrounded
by
a
guard
of
honour
consisting
of
two
colonels
two
first
lieutenants
two
cavalry
sergeants
two
infantry
sergeants
two
corporals
and
two
chamberlains
then
at
last
came
the
moment
when
the
zinc
shell
was
brought
by
eight
lackeys
from
the
altar
recess
of
the
court
church
where
it
had
been
on

on

at

passing

preceded
by

the

the
bearers
of

and

the

immediately
behind
the
charger
which
was
led
in

at

long
boots
under

hussar

with
the
crape
band

not
become
him
he
walked
as
if
embarrassed
by
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
and
his
naturally
rather
crooked
were
twisted
in
an
awkward
nervous
way
as
he
walked
repugnance
at
having
to
be
chief
actor
in
this
funeral
pomp
was
clearly
written
on
his
pale
face
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
as
he
walked
and
he
sucked
his
short
rounded
lower
lip
against
the
upper
his
demeanour
remained
the
same
during
the
curialia
accompanying
his
accession
which
were
so
arranged
as
to
spare
him
as
much
as
possible
the
grand
duke
signed
the
oath
in
the
silver
hall
of
the
gala
rooms
before
the
assembled
ministers
and
read
aloud
in
the
standing
in
front
of
the
rounded
chair
under
the
baldachin
the
speech
from
the
throne
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
drawn
up
the
economic
condition
of
the
country
was
touched
upon
in
it
with
earnestness
and
delicacy
while
appreciative
mention
was
made
of
the
unanimity
which
despite
all
troubles
existed
between
the
princes
and
the
country
at
which
place
a
prominent
functionary
who
was
apparently
discontented
about
promotion
was
said
to
have
whispered
to
his
neighbour
that
the
unanimity
consisted
in
the
prince
being
as
deeply
in
debt
as
the
country
a
caustic
remark
which
was
much
repeated
and
ended
by
getting
into
hostile
newspapers
to
end
up
the
president
of
the
landtag
called
for
a
cheer
for
the
grand
duke
a
service
was
held
in
the
court
chapel
and
that
was
all
further
albrecht
signed
an
edict
by
virtue
of
which
a
number
of
sentences
of
fines
and
imprisonment
which
had
been
imposed
for
the
less
serious
misdemeanours
chiefly
infringement
of
the
forest
laws
were
remitted
the
solemn
procession
through
the
city
and
the
acclamation
in
the
town
hall
were
omitted
altogether
as
the
grand
duke
felt
too
tired
for
them
having
been
a
captain
hitherto
he
was
promoted
on
the
occasion
of
his
accession
at
once
to
the
colonelcy
la
of
his
hussar
regiment
but
scarcely
ever
put
the
uniform
on
and
kept
as
far
away
as
possible
from
his
sphere
as
a
soldier
he
made
no
change
whatever
in
his
staff
perhaps
out
of
respect
to
his
father
memory
either
among
the
court
appointments
or
in
the
ministry
the
public
saw
him
but
rarely
his
proud
and
bashful
disinclination
to
show
himself
to
put
himself
forward
to
allow
others
to
acclaim
him
was
so
clearly
shown
from
the
very
beginning
as
to
shock
public
opinion
he
never
appeared
in
the
large
box
at
the
court
theatre
he
never
took
part
in
the
park
parade
when
in
residence
at
the
old
schloss
he
had
himself
driven
in
a
closed
carriage
to
a
remote
and
empty
part
of
the
suburbs
where
he
got
out
to
take
a
little
exercise
and
in
the
summer
at
hollerbrunn
he
only
left
the
hedged
walks
of
the
parks
on
exceptional
occasions
did
the
people
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
at
the
albrechtstor
it
might
be
when
wrapped
in
his
heavy
fur
coat
which
his
father
had
worn
before
him
and
on
whose
thick
collar
his
delicate
head
now
rested
he
stepped
into
his
carriage
timid
glances
were
levelled
at
him
and
the
cheering
was
faint
and
hesitating
for
the
lower
classes
felt
that
with
a
prince
like
this
there
could
be
no
question
of
cheering
him
and
thereby
cheering
themselves
at
the
same
time
they
looked
at
him
and
did
not
recognize
themselves
in
him
his
refined
superiority
made
it
clear
that
they
were
of
different
clay
from
his
and
they
were
not
accustomed
to
that
was
there
not
a
commissionaire
posted
in
the
albrechtsplatz
that
very
day
who
with
his
high
and
grey
whiskers
looked
a
coarse
and
homely
replica
of
the
late
grand
duke
and
did
one
not
similarly
meet
with
prince
klaus
heinrich
features
in
the
lower
classes
it
was
not
so
with
his
brother
the
people
could
not
see
in
him
an
idealized
version
of
themselves
whom
it
could
make
them
happy
to
cheer
as
it
meant
cheering
themselves
too
the
grand
highness
his
undoubted
highness
was
a
nobility
of
the
usual
kind
undomestic
and
without
the
stamp
of
the
graciousness
which
inspires
confidence
he
too
knew
that
and
the
consciousness
of
his
highness
together
with
that
of
his
want
of
popular
graciousness
were
quite
enough
to
account
for
his
shyness
and
haughtiness
he
began
already
to
delegate
as
far
as
possible
his
duties
to
prince
klaus
heinrich
he
sent
him
to
open
the
new
spring
at
immenstadt
and
to
the
historical
at
butterburg
indeed
his
contempt
for
any
exhibition
of
his
princely
person
went
so
far
that
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
him
to
receive
the
presidents
of
the
two
chambers
in
the
himself
and
not
for
reasons
of
health
as
he
was
minded
to
give
place
to
his
brother
on
this
solemn
occasion

prince
klaus
heinrich
since

kept
a
court
of

down

as

always

in

from

nothing
no

even
the
painful
and
repulsive
ones
with
which

this
erstwhile
goddess
began
to
lose
its
assurance
her
deportment
became
strangely
awkward
and
a
pitiful
look
came
into
her
eyes
at
last
she
shut
herself
up
altogether
and
at
the
last
court
ball
he
attended
johann
albrecht
had
escorted
his
sister
catherine
instead
of
his
indisposed
consort
his
death
was
from
one
point
of
view
a
release
for
dorothea
as
it
relieved
her
from
all
her
duties
as
a
sovereign
she
chose
as
schloss
segenhaus
a
old
which
lay
in
a
solemn
park
about
one
and
a
half
drive
from
the
capital
and
had
been
decorated
by
some
pious
old
sportsman
with
religious
and
sporting
emblems
curiously
intermixed
there
she
lived
eclipsed
and
odd
and
excursionists
could
often
watch
her
from
afar
walking
in
the
park
with
baroness
von
and
bowing
graciously
to
the
trees
on
each
side
of
the
path
lastly
princess
ditlinde
had
married
at
the
age
of
twenty
one
year
after
her
father
death
she
bestowed
her
hand
on
a
prince
of
a
mediatised
house
prince
philipp
zu
a
no
longer
young
but
cultured
little
man
of
advanced
views
who
paid
her
flattering
attentions
for
some
considerable
time
did
all
his
courting
at
and
offered
the
princess
his
heart
and
hand
in
an
honest
bourgeois
way
at
a
charity
function
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
this
alliance
evoked
wild
enthusiasm
in
the
country
it
was
received
with
indifference
it
disappointed
it
is
true
more
ambitious
hopes
had
been
secretly
entertained
for
johann
albrecht
daughter
and
all
the
critics
could
say
was
that
the
marriage
could
not
be
called
a
in
so
many
words
it
was
a
fact
that
ditlinde
in
giving
her
hand
to
the
prince
which
she
did
of
her
own
free
will
and
quite
uninfluenced
by
others
had
undoubtedly
descended
out
of
her
sphere
of
highness
into
a
more
free
and
human
atmosphere
her
noble
spouse
was
not
only
a
lover
and
collector
of
oil
paintings
but
also
a
business
man
and
tradesman
on
a
large
scale
the
dynasty
had
ceased
to
exercise
any
sovereign
right
hundreds
of
years
ago
but
philipp
was
the
first
of
his
house
to
make
up
his
mind
to
exploit
his
private
means
in
a
natural
way
after
spending
his
youth
in
travelling
he
had
looked
around
for
a
sphere
of
activity
which
would
keep
him
busy
and
contented
and
at
the
same
time
a
matter
of
necessity
would
increase
his
income
so
he
launched
out
into
various
enterprises
started
farms
a
brewery
a
sugar
factory
several
on
his
property
and
began
to
exploit
his
extensive
peat
deposits
in
a
methodical
way
as
he
brought
expert
knowledge
and
sound
business
instincts
to
all
his
enterprises
they
soon
began
to
pay
and
returned
profits
which
if
their
origin
was
not
very
princely
at
any
rate
provided
him
with
the
means
of
leading
a
princely
existence
which
he
would
otherwise
not
have
had
on
the
other
hand
the
critics
might
have
been
asked
what
sort
of
a
match
they
could
expect
for
their
princess
if
they
viewed
the
matter
soberly
ditlinde
who
brought
her
husband
scarcely
anything
except
an
inexhaustible
store
of
linen
including
dozens
of
and
useless
articles
such
as
and
neckerchiefs
which
however
by
hallowed
tradition
formed
part
of
her
trousseau
she
by
this
marriage
acquired
a
measure
of
riches
and
comfort
such
as
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
at
home
and
no
sacrifice
of
her
affections
was
necessary
to
pay
for
them
she
took
the
step
into
private
life
with
obvious
contentment
and
determination
and
retained
of
the
trappings
of
highness
nothing
but
her
title
she
remained
on
friendly
terms
with
her
but
divested
her
relations
with
them
of
everything
which
suggested
service
and
avoided
giving
her
household
the
character
of
a
court
that
might
evoke
surprise
especially
in
a
grimmburg
and
in
ditlinde
in
particular
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
her
own
choice
the
couple
spent
the
summer
on
the
princely
estates
the
winter
in
the
capital
in
the
stately
palace
in
the
albrechtstrasse
which
philipp
zu
ried
had
inherited
and
it
was
here
not
in
the
old
schloss
that
the
grand
ducal
family
klaus
heinrich
and
ditlinde
occasionally
albrecht
as
well
met
now
and
again
for
a
confidential
talk
so
it
happened
that
one
day
at
the
beginning
of
autumn
not
quite
two
years
after
the
death
of
johann
albrecht
the
as
usual
published
in
its
evening
edition
the
news
that
this
afternoon
his
royal
highness
the
grand
duke
and
his
grand
ducal
highness
prince
klaus
heinrich
had
been
to
tea
with
her
grand
ducal
highness
the
princess
zu
that
was
all
but
on
that
afternoon
several
topics
of
importance
for
the
future
were
discussed
between
the
brothers
and
sister
klaus
heinrich
left
the
hermitage
shortly
before
five
as
the
weather
was
sunny
he
had
ordered
the
dogcart
and
the
open
vehicle
clean
and
shining
if
not
or
smart
to
look
at
came
slowly
up
the
broad
drive
of
the
schloss
at
a
quarter
to
five
from
the
stables
which
with
their
asphalt
yard
lay
in
the
right
wing
of
the
home
farm
the
home
farm
buildings
of
one
story
made
one
long
line
with
though
at
some
distance
from
the
plain
white
mansion
the
front
of
which
adorned
with
laurels
at
regular
intervals
faced
the
muddy
pond
and
the
public
part
of
the
park
for
the
front
portion
of
the
estate
that
which
marched
with
the
town
gardens
was
open
to
pedestrians
and
light
traffic
and
all
that
was
enclosed
was
the
gently
rising
at
the
top
of
which
lay
the
schloss
and
the
very
unkempt
park
behind
which
was
divided
by
hedges
and
fences
from
the
waste
ground
at
the
edge
of
the
town
suburbs
so
the
cart
came
up
the
drive
between
the
pond
and
the
home
farm
turned
through
the
high
garden
gates
adorned
with
lamps
which
had
once
been
gilt
passed
on
up
the
drive
and
waited
in
front
of
the
stiff
little
terrace
which
led
to
the
klaus
heinrich
came
out
a
few
minutes
before
five
he
wore
as
usual
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
of
the
grenadier
guards
and
his
hung
on
his
arm
neumann
in
a
violet
coat
whose
arms
were
too
short
ran
in
front
of
him
down
the
steps
and
with
his
red
hands
packed
his
master
folded
grey
into
the
cart
then
while
the
coachman
his
hand
to
his
cockaded
hat
inclined
a
little
sideways
on
the
box
the
valet
arranged
the
light
carriage
rug
over
klaus
heinrich
knees
and
stepped
back
with
a
silent
bow
the
horses
started
off
outside
the
garden
gates
a
few
promenaders
had
collected
they
greeted
klaus
heinrich
smiling
with
knitted
brows
and
hats
lifted
and
klaus
heinrich
thanked
them
by
raising
his
right
hand
to
the
peak
of
his
cap
and
making
a
succession
of
lively
nods
they
skirted
a
piece
of
waste
ground
along
a
birch
avenue
whose
leaves
were
already
turning
and
then
drove
through
the
suburb
between
houses
over
unpaved
streets
where
the
ragged
children
left
their
hoops
and
tops
for
a
moment
to
gaze
at
the
carriage
with
curious
eyes
some
cried
hurrah
and
ran
for
a
while
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
with
heads
turned
towards
klaus
heinrich
the
carriage
might
have
taken
the
road
by
the
but
that
through
the
suburb
was
shorter
and
time
pressed
ditlinde
was
particular
on
points
of
regularity
and
easily
put
out
if
anybody
disturbed
her
household
arrangements
by
unpunctuality
yonder
was
the
dorothea
children
hospital
of
which
doctor
sammet
ueberbein
friend
was
the
director
klaus
heinrich
drove
by
it
and
then
the
carriage
left
the
squalid
neighbourhood
and
reached
the
gartenstrasse
a
stately
avenue
in
which
lay
the
houses
and
villas
of
wealthy
citizens
and
along
which
ran
the
from
the
spa
gardens
to
the
centre
of
the
city
the
traffic
here
was
fairly
heavy
and
klaus
heinrich
was
kept
busy
answering
the
greetings
which
met
him
civilians
took
off
their
hats
and
looked
from
under
their
eyebrows
at
him
officers
on
horse
and
on
foot
saluted
policemen
and
klaus
heinrich
in
his
corner
raised
his
hand
to
the
peak
of
his
cap
and
thanked
on
both
sides
with
the
bow
and
smile
which
were
calculated
to
confirm
the
people
in
their
feeling
of
participation
in
his
splendid
personality
his
way
of
sitting
in
his
carriage
was
quite
peculiar
he
did
not
lean
back
indolently
and
comfortably
in
the
cushions
but
he
took
just
as
active
a
part
in
the
motions
of
the
carriage
when
driving
as
in
those
of
his
horse
when
riding
with
hands
crossed
on
his
sword
hilt
and
one
foot
a
little
advanced
he
as
it
were
took
the
unevennesses
of
the
ground
and
accommodated
himself
to
the
motion
of
the
badly
hung
carriage
the
carriage
crossed
the
albrechtsplatz
left
the
old
schloss
with
the
two
sentries
presenting
arms
to
the
right
followed
the
albrechtstrasse
in
the
direction
of
the
barracks
of
the
grenadier
guards
and
rolled
to
the
left
into
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
of
the
princess
of
ried
it
was
a
building
of
regular
proportions
in
the
pedantic
style
with
a
soaring
gable
over
the
main
door
festooned
in
the
mezzanine
story
high
french
windows
in
the
first
story
and
an
elegant
which
was
formed
by
the
two
wings
and
was
separated
from
the
street
by
a
circular
railing
on
whose
pillars
stone
babies
played
but
the
internal
arrangements
of
the
schloss
were
in
contradistinction
to
the
historical
style
of
its
exterior
conceived
throughout
in
an
and
comfortable
bourgeois
taste
ditlinde
received
her
brother
in
a
large
on
the
first
floor
with
several
curved
sofas
in
pale
green
silk
the
back
part
of
the
room
was
separated
from
the
front
by
slender
pillars
and
filled
with
palms
plants
in
metal
bowls
and
tables
covered
with
brilliant
flowers
good
afternoon
klaus
heinrich
said
the
princess
she
was
delicate
and
thin
and
the
only
luxuriant
thing
about
her
was
her
fair
hair
which
used
to
lie
like
ram
horns
round
her
ears
and
now
was
dressed
in
thick
plaits
above
her
face
with
its
high
grimmburg
she
wore
an
indoor
dress
of
soft
stuff
with
a
white
lace
collar
cut
in
a
point
like
a
and
fastened
at
the
waist
with
an
oval
brooch
blue
veins
and
shadows
showed
here
and
there
through
the
delicate
skin
of
her
face
in
the
temples
the
forehead
at
the
corners
of
her
soft
and
calm
blue
eyes
signs
of
approaching
maternity
were
beginning
to
show
themselves
good
afternoon
ditlinde
you
and
your
flowers
answered
klaus
heinrich
as
clapping
his
heels
together
he
bent
over
her
little
white
rather
hand
how
they
do
smell
and
the
garden
full
of
them
i
see
yes
she
said
i
love
flowers
i
have
always
longed
to
be
able
to
live
among
quantities
of
flowers
living
smelling
flowers
which
i
could
watch
growing
it
was
a
kind
of
secret
wish
of
mine
klaus
heinrich
and
i
might
almost
say
that
i
married
for
flowers
for
in
the
old
schloss
as
you
know
there
were
no
flowers
the
old
schloss
and
flowers
we
should
have
had
to
rummage
a
lot
to
find
them
i
sure
and
such
things
plenty
of
them
and
really
when
one
comes
to
think
the
whole
thing
was
like
a
disused
so
dusty
and
horrid
ugh
but
the
ditlinde
yes
my
goodness
one
and
that
in
the
because
its
roses
smell
of
decay
and
the
books
say
that
it
will
one
day
smell
quite
natural
and
nice
just
like
any
other
rose
but
i
ca
believe
it
you
will
soon
he
said
and
looked
at
her
laughingly
have
something
better
than
your
flowers
to
tend
little
ditlinde
yes
she
said
and
blushed
lightly
and
quickly
yes
klaus
heinrich
i
can
hardly
believe
it
and
yet
it
will
be
so
if
god
pleases
but
come
over
here
we
have
a
chat
together
once
more
the
room
on
whose
threshold
they
had
been
talking
was
small
in
comparison
with
its
height
with
a
carpet
and
furnished
with
furniture
the
chairs
of
which
were
upholstered
in
blue
silk
a
china
chandelier
hung
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
were
adorned
with
oil
paintings
of
various
sizes
acquisitions
of
prince
philipp
light
studies
in
the
new
style
representing
white
goats
in
the
sun
poultry
in
the
sun
meadows
and
peasants
with
blinking
faces
the
secretaire
in
the
window
was
covered
with
a
hundred
carefully
arranged
articles
writing
materials
and
several
dainty
for
the
princess
was
accustomed
to
make
careful
and
comprehensive
notes
about
all
her
duties
and
plans
in
front
of
the
inkstand
a
housekeeper
book
in
which
ditlinde
had
apparently
just
been
working
lay
open
and
by
the
table
there
hung
on
the
wall
a
little
under
the
printed
date
of
which
could
be
seen
the
pencil
note
my
brothers
between
the
sofa
and
a
semicircle
of
chairs
over
against
the
white
swing
doors
into
the
reception
room
stood
an
oval
table
with
a
damask
cloth
and
border
the
flowered
a
long
dishes
of
sweet
cakes
and
tiny
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
were
arranged
in
ordered
disorder
on
it
and
to
one
side
steamed
the
silver
over
its
on
a
glass
table
but
there
were
flowers
everywhere
flowers
in
the
vases
on
the
on
the
on
the
glass
table
on
the
on
the
table
next
the
white
sofa
and
a
full
of
stood
in
the
window
this
room
situated
at
the
side
and
in
a
corner
of
the
suite
of
reception
rooms
was
ditlinde
cabinet
her
boudoir
the
room
in
which
she
used
to
entertain
quite
intimate
friends
and
to
make
tea
with
her
own
hands
klaus
heinrich
watched
her
as
she
washed
out
the
with
hot
water
and
put
the
tea
in
with
a
silver
spoon
and
albrecht
is
he
coming
he
asked
with
an
involuntarily
restrained
voice
i
hope
so
she
said
bending
attentively
over
the
crystal
as
if
to
avoid
spilling
any
tea
and
he
too
avoided
looking
at
her
i
have
of
course
asked
him
klaus
heinrich
but
you
know
he
can
not
bind
himself
it
depends
on
his
health
whether
he
comes
i
making
our
tea
at
once
for
albrecht
will
drink
his
milk
possibly
too
jettchen
may
look
in
for
a
bit
you
will
enjoy
seeing
her
again
she
so
lively
and
has
always
got
such
a
lot
to
tell
us
jettchen
meant
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
the
princess
friend
and
confidant
they
had
been
on
terms
since
they
were
children
in
armour
too
as
usual
said
ditlinde
placing
the
filled
on
its
stand
and
examining
her
brother
in
uniform
as
usual
klaus
heinrich
he
stood
with
heels
together
and
rubbed
his
left
hand
which
was
cold
on
his
chest
with
his
right
yes
ditlinde
i
like
it
i
rather
it
fits
so
tight
you
see
and
it
braces
me
up
besides
it
is
cheaper
for
a
proper
civil
wardrobe
runs
into
a
terrible
lot
of
money
i
believe
and
schulenburg
is
always
going
on
about
how
dear
things
are
without
that
so
i
manage
with
two
or
three
coats
and
yet
can
show
myself
in
my
rich
relations
houses
rich
relations
laughed
ditlinde
still
some
way
off
that
klaus
heinrich
they
sat
down
at
the
ditlinde
on
a
sofa
klaus
heinrich
on
a
chair
opposite
the
window
rich
relations
she
repeated
and
the
subject
obviously
excited
her
no
far
from
it
how
can
we
expect
to
be
rich
where
cash
is
so
short
and
everything
is
sunk
in
various
enterprises
klaus
heinrich
and
they
are
young
and
in
the
making
they
all
in
the
development
stage
as
dear
philipp
says
and
wo
bear
full
fruit
till
others
have
succeeded
us
but
things
are
improving
that
much
is
true
and
i
keep
the
household
straight
yes
ditlinde
you
do
keep
it
straight
and
no
mistake
keep
it
straight
and
write
everything
down
and
look
after
the
servants
and
after
all
the
payments
which
one
duty
to
the
world
demands
have
been
made
there
is
a
nice
little
sum
to
put
by
every
year
for
the
children
and
dear
philipp
he
sends
his
greetings
klaus
heinrich
i
forgot
he
very
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
be
here
we
only
just
got
back
from
hohenried
and
there
he
is
already
under
way
at
his
office
on
his
properties
he
small
and
delicate
naturally
but
when
his
peat
or
his
are
in
question
he
gets
red
cheeks
and
he
says
himself
that
he
has
been
much
better
since
he
has
had
so
much
to
do
does
he
say
so
asked
klaus
heinrich
and
a
sad
look
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
looked
straight
beyond
the
at
the
bright
window
yes
i
can
quite
believe
that
it
must
be
very
stimulating
to
be
so
really
splendidly
busy
in
my
park
too
the
meadows
have
been
mowed
a
second
time
this
year
already
and
i
love
seeing
the
hay
built
up
in
steep
heaps
with
a
stick
through
the
middle
of
each
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
camp
of
little
indians
huts
and
then
schulenburg
intends
to
sell
it
but
of
course
that
can
not
be
compared
oh
you
said
ditlinde
and
drew
her
chin
in
with
you
it
quite
different
klaus
heinrich
the
next
to
the
throne
you
are
called
to
other
things
i
imagine
my
goodness
yes
you
enjoy
your
popularity
with
the
people
they
were
silent
for
a
while
then
he
said
and
you
ditlinde
if
i
not
mistaken
you
as
happy
as
even
happier
than
before
i
do
say
that
you
have
got
red
cheeks
like
philipp
from
his
peat
you
always
were
a
bit
transparent
and
you
are
still
but
you
look
flourishing
i
have
yet
asked
since
you
married
but
i
think
there
nothing
to
worry
about
in
connexion
with
you
she
sat
in
an
easy
position
with
her
arm
lightly
folded
across
her
lap
yes
she
said
i
all
right
klaus
heinrich
your
eyes
do
deceive
you
and
it
would
be
ungrateful
of
me
not
to
acknowledge
my
good
fortune
you
see
i
know
quite
well
that
many
people
in
the
country
are
disappointed
by
my
marriage
and
say
that
i
have
ruined
myself
and
demeaned
myself
and
so
on
and
such
people
are
not
far
to
seek
for
brother
albrecht
as
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
in
his
heart
despises
my
dear
philipp
and
me
into
the
bargain
and
ca
abide
him
and
calls
him
privately
a
tradesman
and
shopkeeper
but
that
does
bother
me
for
i
meant
it
when
i
accepted
philipp
hand
seized
it
i
would
say
if
it
did
sound
so
wild
accepted
it
because
it
was
warm
and
honest
and
offered
to
take
me
away
from
the
old
schloss
for
when
i
look
back
and
think
of
the
old
schloss
and
life
in
it
as
i
should
have
gone
on
living
if
it
had
not
been
for
dear
philipp
i
shudder
klaus
heinrich
and
i
feel
that
i
could
not
have
borne
it
and
should
have
become
strange
and
queer
like
poor
mamma
i
am
a
bit
delicate
naturally
as
you
know
i
should
have
simply
gone
under
in
so
much
desolation
and
sadness
and
when
dear
philipp
came
i
thought
now
your
chance
and
when
people
say
that
i
am
a
bad
princess
because
i
have
in
a
way
abdicated
and
fled
here
where
it
is
rather
warmer
and
more
friendly
and
when
they
say
that
i
lack
dignity
or
consciousness
of
highness
or
whatever
they
call
it
they
are
stupid
and
ignorant
klaus
heinrich
because
i
have
too
much
i
have
on
the
contrary
too
much
of
it
that
a
fact
otherwise
the
old
schloss
would
not
have
had
such
an
effect
upon
me
and
albrecht
ought
to
see
that
for
he
too
in
his
way
has
too
much
of
it
all
we
grimmburgers
have
too
much
of
it
and
that
why
it
sometimes
looks
as
if
we
had
too
little
of
it
and
sometimes
when
philipp
is
under
way
as
he
is
now
and
i
sit
here
among
my
flowers
and
philipp
pictures
with
all
their
sun
it
lucky
that
it
painted
sun
for
bless
me
otherwise
we
should
have
to
get
and
everything
is
tidy
and
clean
and
i
think
of
the
blessing
as
you
call
it
in
store
for
me
then
i
seem
to
myself
like
the
little
mermaid
in
the
which
the
swiss
governess
read
to
us
if
you
remember
who
married
a
mortal
and
got
legs
instead
of
her
fish
tail
i
do
know
if
you
understand
me
oh
yes
ditlinde
of
course
i
understand
you
perfectly
and
i
am
really
glad
that
everything
has
turned
out
so
well
and
happily
for
you
for
it
is
dangerous
i
may
tell
you
in
my
experience
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
be
suitably
happy
it
so
easy
to
go
wrong
and
be
misunderstood
for
the
nuisance
is
that
nobody
protects
our
dignity
for
us
if
we
do
do
it
ourselves
and
then
blame
and
scandal
so
readily
follow
but
which
is
the
right
way
you
have
found
it
they
have
quite
recently
announced
my
engagement
with
cousin
griseldis
in
the
newspapers
that
was
a
as
they
call
it
and
they
think
it
was
a
very
happy
one
but
griseldis
is
a
silly
girl
and
with
anæmia
and
never
says
anything
but
so
far
as
i
know
never
given
her
a
thought
nor
has
knobelsdorff
thank
goodness
the
news
was
at
once
announced
to
be
unfounded
here
comes
albrecht
he
said
and
stood
up
a
cough
was
heard
outside
a
footman
in
livery
threw
open
the
swing
doors
with
a
quick
firm
and
noiseless
movement
of
both
arms
and
announced
in
a
subdued
voice
his
royal
highness
the
grand
duke
then
he
stepped
aside
with
a
bow
albrecht
advanced
through
the
room
he
had
traversed
the
hundred
yards
from
the
old
schloss
hither
in
a
closed
carriage
with
his
huntsman
on
the
box
he
was
in
mufti
as
almost
always
wore
a
with
little
satin
lapels
and
boots
on
his
small
feet
since
his
accession
he
had
grown
an
imperial
his
short
fair
hair
was
brushed
back
on
each
of
his
narrow
sunk
temples
his
gait
was
an
awkward
and
yet
indescribably
distinguished
strut
which
gave
his
a
peculiar
twist
he
carried
his
head
well
back
and
stuck
his
short
round
underlip
out
sucking
gently
with
it
against
the
upper
one
the
princess
went
to
the
threshold
to
meet
him
he
disliked
so
he
simply
held
out
his
hand
with
a
soft
almost
whispered
greeting
his
thin
cold
hand
which
looked
so
sensitive
and
which
he
stretched
out
from
his
chest
while
keeping
his
forearm
close
to
his
body
then
he
greeted
his
brother
klaus
heinrich
in
the
same
way
who
had
waited
for
him
standing
with
heels
close
together
in
front
of
his
chair
and
said
nothing
further
ditlinde
talked
it
very
nice
of
you
to
come
albrecht
so
feeling
well
you
look
splendid
philipp
wishes
me
to
tell
you
how
sorry
he
is
to
have
to
be
out
this
afternoon
sit
down
wo
you
anywhere
you
like
here
for
instance
opposite
me
that
chair
a
pretty
comfortable
one
you
sat
in
it
last
time
i
made
tea
for
us
in
the
meantime
you
have
your
milk
directly
thanks
he
said
quietly
i
must
beg
pardon
i
late
you
know
the
shorter
the
road
and
then
i
have
to
lie
down
in
the
afternoon
there
no
one
else
coming
no
one
else
albrecht
at
the
most
jettchen
isenschnibbe
may
look
in
for
a
bit
if
you
do
object
oh
but
i
can
just
as
well
say
at
home
oh
no
pray
do
hot
milk
was
brought
albrecht
clasped
the
tall
thick
studded
glass
in
both
hands
ah
something
warm
he
said
how
cold
it
is
already
in
these
parts
and
i
been
frozen
the
whole
summer
in
hollerbrunn
have
you
started
fires
yet
i
have
but
then
again
the
smell
of
the
stoves
upsets
me
all
stoves
smell
von
bühl
promises
me
central
heating
for
the
old
schloss
every
autumn
but
it
seems
not
to
be
feasible
poor
albrecht
said
ditlinde
at
this
time
of
year
you
used
to
be
already
in
the
south
so
long
as
father
was
alive
you
must
long
for
it
your
sympathy
does
you
credit
dear
ditlinde
answered
he
still
in
a
low
and
slightly
lisping
voice
but
we
must
show
that
i
am
on
the
spot
i
must
rule
the
country
as
you
know
that
what
i
here
for
i
have
been
graciously
pleased
to
allow
some
worthy
citizen
i
sorry
i
ca
remember
his
name
to
accept
and
wear
a
foreign
order
further
i
have
had
a
telegram
sent
to
the
annual
meeting
of
the
horticultural
society
in
which
i
assumed
the
honorary
presidency
of
the
society
and
pledged
my
word
to
further
its
efforts
in
every
way
without
really
knowing
what
furthering
i
could
do
beyond
sending
the
telegram
for
the
members
are
quite
well
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
further
i
have
deigned
to
confirm
the
choice
of
a
certain
worthy
fellow
to
be
mayor
of
my
fair
city
of
siebenberge
in
connection
with
which
i
should
like
to
know
whether
this
my
subject
will
be
a
better
mayor
for
my
confirmation
than
he
would
have
been
without
it
well
well
albrecht
those
are
trifles
said
ditlinde
i
convinced
that
you
had
more
serious
business
to
do
oh
of
course
i
had
a
talk
with
my
minister
of
finance
and
agriculture
it
was
time
i
did
doctor
krippenreuther
would
have
been
bitterly
disappointed
with
me
if
i
had
not
summoned
him
once
more
he
went
ahead
in
summary
fashion
and
laid
before
me
a
conspectus
of
several
mutually
related
topics
at
once
the
harvest
the
new
principles
for
the
drawing
up
of
the
budget
the
reform
of
taxation
on
which
he
is
busy
the
harvest
has
been
a
bad
one
it
seems
the
peasants
have
been
hit
by
blight
and
bad
weather
not
only
they
but
krippenreuther
too
are
much
concerned
about
it
because
the
resources
of
the
land
he
says
have
once
more
suffered
contraction
besides
there
have
unfortunately
been
disasters
in
more
than
one
of
the
the
gear
is
at
a
standstill
says
krippenreuther
it
is
damaged
and
will
cost
a
lot
of
money
to
repair
i
listened
to
the
whole
recital
with
an
appropriate
expression
on
my
face
and
did
what
i
could
to
express
my
grief
for
such
a
series
of
misfortunes
next
i
was
consulted
as
to
whether
the
cost
of
the
necessary
new
buildings
for
the
treasury
and
for
the
woods
and
customs
and
inland
revenue
offices
ought
to
be
debited
to
the
ordinary
or
the
extraordinary
estimates
i
learnt
a
lot
about
sliding
scales
and
income
tax
and
tax
on
tourist
traffic
and
the
removal
of
burdens
from
oppressed
agriculture
and
the
imposition
of
burdens
on
the
towns
and
on
the
whole
i
got
the
impression
that
krippenreuther
was
well
up
in
his
subject
i
of
course
know
practically
nothing
about
it
which
krippenreuther
knows
and
approves
so
i
just
said
yes
and
course
and
thanks
and
let
him
run
on
you
speak
so
bitterly
albrecht
no
i
just
tell
you
what
struck
me
while
krippenreuther
was
holding
forth
to
me
there
a
man
living
in
this
town
a
man
with
small
private
means
and
a
warty
nose
every
child
knows
him
and
shouts
when
he
sees
him
he
is
called
hatter
for
he
is
not
quite
all
there
his
surname
he
has
lost
long
ago
he
is
always
on
the
spot
when
there
is
anything
going
on
although
his
keeps
him
from
playing
any
serious
part
in
anything
he
wears
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
and
carries
his
hat
about
on
the
end
of
his
twice
a
day
about
the
time
when
a
train
starts
he
goes
to
the
station
taps
the
wheels
examines
the
luggage
and
fusses
about
then
when
the
guard
blows
his
whistle
hatter
waves
to
the
and
the
train
starts
but
hatter
deludes
himself
into
thinking
that
his
waving
sends
the
train
off
that
like
me
i
wave
and
the
train
starts
but
it
would
start
without
me
and
my
waving
makes
no
difference
it
mere
silly
show
i
sick
of
it
the
brother
and
sister
were
silent
ditlinde
looked
at
her
lap
in
an
embarrassed
way
and
klaus
heinrich
gazed
as
he
tugged
at
his
little
moustache
between
her
and
the
grand
duke
at
the
bright
window
i
can
quite
follow
you
albrecht
said
he
after
a
while
though
it
is
rather
cruel
of
you
to
compare
yourself
and
us
with
hatter
you
see
i
too
understand
nothing
about
sliding
scales
and
taxation
of
tourist
traffic
and
and
there
is
such
a
lot
about
which
i
know
nothing
everything
which
is
covered
by
the
expression
misery
in
the
world
hunger
and
want
and
the
struggle
for
existence
as
it
is
called
and
war
and
hospital
horrors
and
all
that
i
have
seen
and
studied
not
one
of
these
except
death
itself
when
father
died
and
that
too
was
not
death
as
it
can
be
but
rather
it
was
edifying
and
the
whole
schloss
was
illuminated
and
at
times
i
feel
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
have
not
knocked
about
the
world
but
then
i
tell
myself
that
mine
is
not
a
comfortable
life
not
at
all
comfortable
although
i
on
the
heights
of
mankind
as
people
express
it
or
perhaps
just
because
i
do
and
that
i
perhaps
in
my
own
way
know
more
about
the
strenuousness
of
life
its
countenance
if
you
will
allow
me
the
expression
than
many
a
one
who
knows
all
about
the
sliding
scales
or
any
other
single
department
of
life
and
the
upshot
of
that
is
albrecht
that
my
life
is
not
a
comfortable
one
that
the
upshot
of
everything
if
you
will
allow
me
this
retort
and
that
is
how
we
justify
ourselves
and
if
people
cry
when
they
see
me
they
must
know
why
they
do
so
and
my
life
must
have
some
although
i
am
prevented
from
playing
any
serious
part
in
anything
as
you
so
admirably
express
it
and
you
quite
justified
too
you
wave
to
order
because
the
people
wish
you
to
wave
and
if
you
do
not
really
control
their
wishes
and
aspirations
yet
you
express
them
and
give
them
substance
and
may
be
that
no
slight
matter
albrecht
sat
upright
at
the
table
he
held
his
thin
strangely
hands
crossed
on
the
in
front
of
the
tall
glass
of
milk
and
his
eyelids
dropped
and
he
sucked
his
underlip
against
his
upper
he
answered
quietly
i
not
surprised
that
so
popular
a
prince
as
you
should
be
contented
with
his
lot
i
for
my
part
decline
to
express
somebody
else
in
my
own
person
i
decline
to
say
and
you
may
think
it
a
case
of
sour
grapes
as
much
as
you
like
the
truth
is
that
i
care
for
the
of
the
people
just
as
little
as
any
living
soul
possibly
could
care
i
say
soul
not
body
the
flesh
is
weak
there
something
in
one
which
expands
at
applause
and
contracts
at
cold
silence
but
my
reason
rises
superior
to
all
considerations
of
popularity
or
unpopularity
if
i
succeed
in
being
a
true
national
representative
i
know
what
that
would
amount
to
a
misconception
of
my
personality
besides
a
few
from
people
one
does
not
know
are
not
worth
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
others
you
may
be
inspired
by
the
feeling
of
the
people
behind
you
you
must
forgive
me
for
being
too
to
feel
any
such
mysterious
feeling
of
happiness
and
too
keen
on
cleanliness
also
if
you
will
allow
me
to
put
it
thus
that
kind
of
happiness
stinks
to
my
thinking
anyhow
i
a
stranger
to
the
people
i
give
them
nothing
what
can
they
give
me
with
you
oh
that
quite
different
hundreds
of
thousands
who
are
like
you
are
grateful
to
you
because
they
can
recognize
themselves
in
you
you
may
laugh
if
you
like
the
chief
danger
you
run
is
that
you
submerge
yourself
in
your
popularity
too
readily
and
yet
after
all
you
feel
no
apprehensions
although
you
are
aware
at
this
very
moment
no
albrecht
i
do
think
so
i
do
think
i
run
any
such
danger
then
we
shall
understand
each
other
all
the
better
i
have
no
penchant
for
strong
expressions
as
a
rule
but
popularity
is
it
funny
albrecht
funny
that
you
should
use
that
word
the
were
always
using
it
my
schoolmates
the
young
sprigs
you
know
at
the
i
know
what
you
are
you
an
aristocrat
that
what
the
matter
do
you
think
so
you
wrong
i
no
aristocrat
i
the
opposite
by
taste
and
reason
you
must
allow
that
i
do
not
despise
the
of
the
crowd
from
arrogance
but
from
a
propensity
to
humanity
and
goodness
human
highness
is
a
pitiable
thing
and
i
convinced
that
mankind
ought
to
see
that
everyone
behaves
like
a
man
and
a
good
man
to
his
neighbour
and
does
not
humiliate
him
or
cause
him
shame
a
man
must
have
a
thick
skin
to
be
able
to
carry
off
all
the
flummery
of
highness
without
any
feeling
of
shame
i
am
naturally
rather
sensitive
i
can
not
cope
with
the
absurdity
of
my
situation
every
lackey
who
plants
himself
at
the
door
and
expects
me
to
pass
him
without
noticing
without
heeding
him
more
than
the
door
posts
fills
me
with
embarrassment
that
the
way
i
feel
towards
the
people
yes
albrecht
quite
true
it
often
by
no
means
easy
to
keep
countenance
when
one
passes
by
a
fellow
like
that
the
lackeys
if
one
only
did
not
know
what
frauds
they
are
one
hears
fine
stories
about
them
what
stories
oh
one
keeps
one
ears
open
come
come
said
ditlinde
do
let
worry
about
that
here
you
are
talking
about
ordinary
things
and
i
had
two
topics
noted
down
which
i
thought
we
might
discuss
this
afternoon
would
you
be
so
kind
klaus
heinrich
as
to
reach
me
that
notebook
there
in
blue
leather
on
the
many
thanks
i
note
down
in
this
everything
i
have
to
remember
both
household
matters
and
other
things
what
a
blessing
it
is
to
be
able
to
see
everything
down
in
black
and
white
my
head
is
terribly
weak
it
ca
remember
things
and
if
i
were
tidy
and
did
jot
everything
down
i
should
be
done
for
first
of
all
albrecht
before
i
forget
it
i
wanted
to
remind
you
that
you
must
escort
aunt
catherine
at
the
first
court
on
november
you
ca
get
out
of
it
i
withdraw
the
honour
fell
to
me
at
the
last
court
ball
and
aunt
catherine
was
terribly
put
out
do
you
consent
good
then
i
cross
out
item
secondly
klaus
heinrich
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
make
a
short
appearance
at
the
orphan
children
bazaar
on
the
in
the
town
hall
i
am
patroness
and
i
take
my
duties
seriously
as
you
see
you
need
buy
anything
a
pocket
comb
in
short
all
you
need
do
is
to
show
yourself
for
ten
minutes
it
for
the
orphans
will
you
come
you
see
now
i
can
cross
another
off
thirdly
but
the
princess
was
interrupted
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
the
court
lady
was
announced
and
tripped
in
at
once
through
the
big
her
feather
boa
waving
in
the
draught
and
the
brim
of
her
huge
feather
hat
flapping
up
and
down
the
smell
of
the
fresh
air
from
outside
seemed
to
cling
to
her
clothes
she
was
small
very
fair
with
a
pointed
nose
and
so
that
she
could
not
see
the
stars
on
clear
evenings
she
would
stand
on
her
balcony
and
gaze
at
the
starry
heavens
through
and
rave
about
them
she
wore
two
strong
pairs
of
glasses
one
behind
the
other
and
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
stuck
her
head
forward
as
she
curtseyed
heavens
grand
ducal
highness
she
said
i
did
know
disturbing
you
i
intruding
i
most
humbly
beg
pardon
the
brothers
had
risen
and
the
visitor
as
she
curtseyed
to
them
was
filled
with
confusion
as
albrecht
extended
his
hand
from
his
chest
keeping
his
forearm
close
to
his
body
her
arm
was
stretched
out
almost
perpendicularly
when
the
curtsey
which
she
made
him
had
reached
its
lowest
point
dear
jettchen
said
ditlinde
what
nonsense
you
are
expected
and
welcome
and
my
brothers
know
that
we
call
each
other
by
our
christian
names
so
none
of
that
grand
ducal
highness
if
you
please
we
are
not
in
the
old
schloss
sit
down
and
make
yourself
comfortable
will
you
have
some
tea
it
still
hot
and
here
are
some
candied
fruits
i
know
you
like
them
yes
a
thousand
thanks
ditlinde
i
adore
them
and
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
took
a
chair
on
the
narrow
side
of
the
opposite
klaus
heinrich
with
her
back
to
the
window
drew
a
glove
off
and
began
peering
forward
to
lay
sweetmeats
on
her
plate
with
the
silver
tongs
her
little
bosom
heaved
quickly
and
nervously
with
pleasurable
excitement
i
got
some
news
she
said
unable
any
longer
to
contain
herself
news
more
than
any
reticule
will
hold
that
is
to
say
it
is
really
only
one
piece
of
news
only
one
but
it
so
weighty
that
it
counts
for
dozens
and
it
is
quite
certain
i
have
it
on
the
best
authority
you
know
that
i
am
reliable
ditlinde
this
very
evening
it
will
be
in
the
and
the
whole
town
will
be
talking
about
it
yes
jettchen
said
the
princess
it
must
be
confessed
you
never
come
with
empty
hands
but
now
we
excited
do
tell
us
your
news
very
well
let
me
get
my
breath
do
you
know
ditlinde
does
your
royal
highness
know
does
your
grand
ducal
highness
know
who
coming
who
is
coming
to
the
spa
who
is
coming
for
six
or
eight
weeks
to
the
spa
hotel
to
drink
the
waters
no
said
ditlinde
but
do
you
know
dear
jettchen
spoelmann
said
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
spoelmann
she
said
leaned
back
and
made
as
if
to
draw
with
her
fingers
on
the
but
checked
the
movement
of
her
hand
just
over
the
blue
silk
border
the
brothers
and
sister
looked
doubtfully
at
each
other
spoelmann
asked
ditlinde
think
a
moment
jettchen
the
real
spoelmann
the
real
one
her
voice
cracked
with
suppressed
jubilation
the
real
one
ditlinde
for
there
only
one
or
rather
only
one
whom
everybody
knows
and
he
it
is
whom
they
are
expecting
at
the
spa
hotel
the
great
spoelmann
the
giant
spoelmann
the
colossus
samuel
spoelmann
from
america
but
child
what
bringing
him
here
really
forgive
me
for
saying
so
ditlinde
but
what
a
question
his
yacht
or
some
big
steamer
is
bringing
him
over
the
sea
of
course
on
his
holidays
making
a
tour
of
europe
and
has
expressed
his
intention
of
drinking
the
spa
waters
but
is
he
ill
then
of
course
ditlinde
all
people
of
his
kind
are
ill
that
part
of
the
business
strange
said
klaus
heinrich
yes
grand
ducal
highness
it
is
remarkable
his
kind
of
existence
must
bring
that
with
it
for
there
no
doubt
it
a
trying
existence
and
not
at
all
a
comfortable
one
and
must
wear
the
body
out
quicker
than
an
ordinary
man
life
would
most
suffer
in
the
stomach
but
spoelmann
suffers
from
stone
as
everybody
knows
stone
does
he
of
course
ditlinde
you
must
have
heard
it
and
forgotten
it
he
has
stone
in
the
kidneys
if
you
will
forgive
me
the
horrid
expression
a
serious
trying
illness
and
i
sure
he
ca
get
the
slightest
pleasure
from
his
frantic
wealth
but
how
in
the
world
has
he
pitched
upon
our
waters
why
ditlinde
that
simple
the
waters
are
good
they
excellent
especially
the
ditlinde
spring
with
its
lithium
or
whatever
they
call
it
is
admirable
against
gout
and
stone
and
only
waiting
to
be
properly
known
and
valued
throughout
the
world
but
a
man
like
spoelmann
you
can
imagine
a
man
like
that
is
above
names
and
and
follows
his
own
kind
and
so
he
has
discovered
our
waters
or
his
physician
has
recommended
them
to
him
it
may
be
that
and
bought
it
in
the
bottle
and
it
has
done
him
good
and
now
he
may
think
that
it
must
do
him
still
more
good
if
he
drinks
it
on
the
spot
they
all
kept
silence
great
heavens
albrecht
said
ditlinde
at
last
whatever
one
thinks
of
spoelmann
and
his
kind
and
i
not
going
to
commit
myself
to
an
opinion
of
that
you
may
be
sure
but
do
you
think
that
the
visit
to
the
spa
may
be
very
useful
the
grand
duke
turned
his
head
with
his
stiff
and
refined
smile
ask
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
he
answered
she
has
doubtless
already
considered
the
question
from
that
point
of
view
if
your
royal
highness
asks
me
enormously
useful
immeasurably
incalculably
useful
that
obvious
the
directors
are
in
the
seventh
heaven
they
getting
ready
to
decorate
and
illuminate
the
spa
hotel
what
a
recommendation
what
an
attraction
for
strangers
will
your
royal
highness
just
consider
the
man
is
a
curiosity
your
grand
ducal
highness
spoke
just
now
of
kind
but
there
are
none
of
kind
at
most
only
a
couple
he
a
leviathan
a
croesus
people
will
come
from
miles
away
to
see
a
being
who
has
about
half
a
million
a
day
to
spend
gracious
said
ditlinde
taken
aback
and
there
dear
philipp
worrying
about
his
peat
beds
the
first
scene
the
fräulein
went
on
begins
with
two
americans
hanging
about
the
exchange
for
the
last
couple
of
days
who
are
they
they
are
said
to
be
journalists
reporters
for
two
big
new
york
papers
they
have
preceded
the
leviathan
and
are
telegraphing
to
their
papers
preliminary
descriptions
of
the
scenery
when
he
has
got
here
they
will
telegraph
every
step
he
takes
just
as
the
and
the
report
about
your
royal
highness
albrecht
bowed
his
thanks
with
eyes
downcast
and
underlip
protruded
he
has
appropriated
the
prince
suite
in
the
spa
hotel
said
jettchen
as
provisional
lodgings
for
himself
alone
asked
ditlinde
oh
no
ditlinde
do
you
suppose
he
be
coming
alone
there
is
any
precise
information
about
his
suite
and
staff
but
it
quite
certain
that
his
daughter
and
his
are
coming
with
him
it
annoys
me
jettchen
to
hear
you
talking
about
a
and
the
journalists
too
and
the
prince
suite
to
boot
he
not
a
king
after
all
a
railway
king
so
far
as
i
know
remarked
albrecht
quietly
with
eyes
downcast
not
only
nor
even
particularly
a
railway
king
royal
highness
according
to
what
i
hear
over
in
america
they
have
those
great
business
concerns
called
trusts
as
your
royal
highness
knows
the
steel
trust
for
instance
the
sugar
trust
the
petroleum
trust
the
coal
meat
and
tobacco
trusts
and
goodness
knows
how
many
more
and
samuel
spoelmann
has
a
finger
in
nearly
all
these
trusts
and
is
chief
shareholder
in
them
and
managing
director
that
what
i
believe
they
call
them
so
his
business
must
be
what
is
called
over
here
a
goods
business
a
nice
sort
of
business
said
ditlinde
it
must
be
a
nice
sort
of
business
for
you
ca
persuade
me
dear
jettchen
that
honest
work
can
make
a
man
into
a
leviathan
and
a
croesus
i
am
convinced
that
his
riches
are
steeped
in
the
blood
of
widows
and
orphans
what
do
you
think
albrecht
i
hope
so
ditlinde
i
hope
so
for
your
own
and
your
comfort
may
be
so
explained
jettchen
yet
spoelmann
our
samuel
spoelmann
is
hardly
responsible
for
it
for
he
is
really
nothing
but
an
heir
and
may
quite
well
not
have
had
any
particular
taste
for
his
business
it
was
his
father
who
really
made
the
pile
i
read
all
about
it
and
may
say
that
i
really
know
the
general
facts
his
father
was
a
german
simply
an
adventurer
who
crossed
the
seas
and
became
and
he
was
lucky
and
made
a
little
money
through
or
rather
quite
a
decent
amount
of
money
and
began
to
speculate
in
petroleum
and
steel
and
railways
and
then
in
every
sort
of
thing
and
kept
growing
richer
and
richer
and
when
he
died
everything
was
already
in
full
swing
and
his
son
samuel
who
inherited
the
croesus
firm
really
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
collect
the
princely
dividends
and
keep
growing
richer
and
richer
till
he
beat
all
records
that
the
way
things
have
gone
and
he
has
a
daughter
has
he
jettchen
what
she
like
yes
ditlinde
his
wife
is
dead
but
he
has
a
daughter
miss
spoelmann
and
he
bringing
her
with
him
she
a
wonderful
girl
from
all
read
about
her
he
himself
is
a
bit
of
a
mixture
for
his
father
married
a
wife
from
the
south
creole
blood
the
daughter
of
a
german
father
and
native
mother
but
samuel
in
his
turn
married
a
of
blood
and
their
daughter
is
now
miss
spoelmann
gracious
jettchen
she
a
creature
of
many
colours
you
may
well
say
so
ditlinde
and
she
clever
so
i
heard
she
studies
like
a
man
algebra
and
puzzling
things
of
that
sort
hm
that
too
does
attract
me
much
but
now
comes
the
cream
of
the
business
ditlinde
for
miss
spoelmann
has
a
and
that
is
a
countess
a
real
genuine
countess
who
dances
attendance
on
her
gracious
said
ditlinde
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
no
jettchen
my
mind
is
made
up
i
not
going
to
bother
myself
about
spoelmann
i
going
to
let
him
drink
his
waters
and
go
with
his
countess
and
his
algebraical
daughter
and
am
not
going
so
much
as
to
turn
my
head
to
look
at
him
he
and
his
riches
make
no
impression
on
me
what
do
you
think
klaus
heinrich
klaus
heinrich
looked
past
jettchen
head
at
the
bright
window
impression
he
said
no
riches
make
no
impression
on
me
i
think
i
mean
riches
in
the
ordinary
way
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
depends
it
depends
i
think
on
the
standard
we
too
have
one
or
two
rich
people
in
the
town
here
unschlitt
must
be
a
millionaire
i
often
see
him
in
his
carriage
he
dreadfully
fat
and
common
but
when
a
man
is
quite
ill
and
lonely
from
mere
riches
maybe
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
man
anyhow
said
ditlinde
and
the
subject
of
the
spoelmanns
gradually
dropped
the
conversation
turned
on
family
matters
the
hohenried
property
and
the
approaching
season
shortly
before
seven
the
grand
duke
sent
for
his
carriage
prince
klaus
heinrich
was
going
too
so
they
all
got
up
and
said
but
while
the
brothers
were
being
helped
into
their
coats
in
the
hall
albrecht
said
i
should
be
obliged
klaus
heinrich
if
you
would
send
your
coachman
home
and
would
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
company
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
i
got
a
matter
of
some
importance
to
discuss
with
you
i
might
come
with
you
to
the
hermitage
but
i
bear
the
evening
air
klaus
heinrich
clapped
his
heels
together
as
he
answered
no
albrecht
you
must
think
of
it
i
drive
to
the
schloss
with
you
if
you
like
i
am
of
course
at
your
disposal
this
was
the
prelude
to
a
remarkable
conversation
between
the
young
princes
the
upshot
of
which
was
published
a
few
days
later
in
the
and
received
with
general
approval
the
prince
accompanied
the
grand
duke
to
the
schloss
through
the
albrechtstor
up
broad
stone
steps
through
corridors
where
naked
gas
lamps
were
burning
and
silent
between
lackeys
into
albrecht
closet
where
old
prahl
had
lighted
the
two
bronze
on
the
mantelpiece
albrecht
had
taken
over
his
it
had
always
been
the
of
the
reigning
sovereigns
and
lay
on
the
first
floor
between
an
room
and
the
in
daily
use
facing
the
albrechtsplatz
which
the
princes
had
always
overlooked
and
watched
from
their
it
was
an
exceptionally
unhomely
and
repellent
room
small
with
cracked
red
silk
and
carpet
and
three
windows
reaching
to
the
ground
through
which
the
draught
blew
keenly
and
before
which
the
curtains
with
their
elaborate
fringes
were
drawn
it
had
a
false
in
french
empire
taste
in
front
of
which
a
semicircle
of
little
modern
quilted
plush
chairs
without
arms
were
arranged
and
a
hideously
decorated
white
stove
which
gave
out
a
great
heat
two
big
quilted
sofas
stood
opposite
each
other
by
the
walls
and
in
front
of
one
stood
a
square
with
a
red
plush
cover
between
the
windows
two
narrow
mirrors
with
marble
ledges
reached
up
to
the
ceiling
the
right
hand
one
of
which
bore
a
fairly
cheerful
alabaster
group
the
other
a
water
bottle
and
medicine
glasses
the
an
old
piece
made
of
with
a
and
metal
clasps
stood
clear
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
the
red
carpet
an
antique
stared
down
with
its
dead
eyes
from
a
pedestal
in
one
corner
of
the
room
what
i
have
to
suggest
to
you
said
albrecht
he
was
standing
at
the
unconsciously
toying
with
a
a
silly
thing
like
a
with
a
grotesque
handle
is
directly
connected
with
our
conversation
this
afternoon
i
may
begin
by
saying
that
i
discussed
the
matter
thoroughly
with
knobelsdorff
this
summer
at
hollerbrunn
he
agrees
and
if
you
do
too
as
i
do
doubt
you
will
i
can
carry
out
my
intention
at
once
please
let
hear
it
albrecht
said
klaus
heinrich
who
was
standing
at
attention
in
a
military
attitude
by
the
sofa
table
my
health
continued
the
grand
duke
has
been
getting
worse
and
worse
lately
i
very
sorry
albrecht
hollerbrunn
did
agree
with
you
then
thanks
no
i
in
a
bad
way
and
my
health
is
showing
itself
increasingly
unequal
to
the
demands
made
upon
it
when
i
say
i
mean
chiefly
the
duties
of
a
ceremonial
and
representative
nature
which
are
inseparable
from
my
position
and
that
the
bond
of
connexion
with
the
conversation
we
had
just
now
at
ditlinde
the
performance
of
these
duties
may
be
a
happiness
when
a
contact
with
the
people
a
relationship
a
beating
of
hearts
in
unison
exists
to
me
it
is
a
torture
and
the
falseness
of
my
rôle
wearies
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
must
consider
what
measures
i
can
take
to
counteract
it
in
this
so
far
as
the
bodily
part
of
me
is
concerned
i
am
at
one
with
my
doctors
who
entirely
agree
with
my
proposal
so
listen
to
me
i
unmarried
i
have
no
idea
i
can
assure
you
of
ever
marrying
i
shall
have
no
children
you
are
heir
to
the
throne
by
right
of
birth
you
are
still
more
so
in
the
consciousness
of
the
people
who
love
you
there
you
are
albrecht
always
talking
about
my
being
beloved
i
simply
do
believe
it
at
a
distance
perhaps
that
the
way
with
us
it
always
at
a
distance
that
we
are
beloved
you
too
modest
wait
a
bit
you
already
been
kind
enough
to
relieve
me
of
some
of
my
representative
duties
now
and
then
i
should
like
you
to
relieve
me
of
all
of
them
absolutely
for
always
you
not
thinking
of
abdicating
albrecht
asked
klaus
heinrich
aghast
i
dare
think
of
it
believe
me
i
gladly
would
but
i
should
be
allowed
to
what
i
thinking
of
is
not
a
regency
but
only
a
substitution
perhaps
you
have
some
recollection
of
the
distinction
in
public
law
from
your
student
days
a
permanent
and
officially
established
substitution
in
all
representative
functions
warranted
by
the
need
of
indulgence
required
by
my
state
of
health
what
is
your
opinion
i
at
your
orders
albrecht
but
i
not
quite
clear
yet
how
far
does
the
substitution
extend
oh
as
far
as
possible
i
should
like
it
to
extend
to
all
occasions
on
which
a
personal
appearance
in
public
is
expected
of
me
knobelsdorff
stipulates
that
i
should
only
devolve
the
opening
and
closure
of
parliament
on
you
when
i
bedridden
only
now
and
again
let
grant
that
but
otherwise
you
would
be
my
substitute
on
all
ceremonial
occasions
on
journeys
visits
to
cities
opening
of
public
festivities
opening
of
the
citizens
ball
that
too
why
not
we
have
also
the
weekly
free
audiences
here
a
sensible
custom
without
a
doubt
but
it
tires
me
out
you
would
hold
the
audiences
in
my
place
i
need
go
on
do
you
accept
my
proposal
i
am
at
your
orders
then
listen
to
me
while
i
finish
for
every
occasion
on
which
you
act
as
my
representative
i
lend
you
my
it
is
further
necessary
that
your
military
promotion
should
be
hastened
are
you
first
lieutenant
you
be
made
a
captain
or
a
major
straight
away
la
of
your
regiment
i
see
to
that
but
in
the
third
place
i
wish
duly
to
emphasize
our
arrangement
to
make
your
position
at
my
side
properly
clear
by
lending
you
the
title
of
highness
there
were
some
formalities
to
attend
to
knobelsdorff
has
already
seen
to
them
i
going
to
express
my
intentions
in
the
form
of
two
missives
to
you
and
to
my
minister
of
state
knobelsdorff
has
already
drafted
them
do
you
accept
what
am
i
to
say
albrecht
you
are
father
eldest
son
and
always
looked
up
to
you
because
i
always
felt
and
known
that
you
are
the
superior
and
higher
of
us
two
and
that
i
am
only
a
plebeian
compared
with
you
but
if
you
think
me
worthy
to
stand
at
your
side
and
to
bear
your
title
and
to
represent
you
before
the
people
although
i
think
myself
anything
like
so
presentable
and
have
this
deformity
here
with
my
left
hand
which
i
always
got
to
keep
covered
then
i
thank
you
and
put
myself
at
your
orders
then
i
ask
you
to
leave
me
now
please
i
want
to
rest
they
advanced
towards
each
other
the
one
from
the
the
other
from
the
over
the
carpet
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
grand
duke
extended
his
hand
to
his
brother
his
thin
cold
hand
which
he
stretched
out
from
his
chest
without
moving
his
forearm
away
from
his
body
klaus
heinrich
clapped
his
heels
together
and
bowed
as
he
took
the
hand
and
albrecht
nodded
his
narrow
head
with
its
fair
beard
as
a
token
of
dismissal
while
he
sucked
his
short
rounded
lower
lip
against
the
upper
klaus
heinrich
went
back
to
the
schloss
hermitage
both
the
and
the
published
eight
days
later
the
two
missives
which
contained
decisions
of
the
highest
importance
the
one
addressed
to
my
dear
minister
of
state
baron
von
knobelsdorff
and
the
other

with
most
serene
highness
and

signed
your
royal
highness
most
devoted
brother
albrecht
vi
the
lofty
calling
here
follows
a
description
of
klaus
heinrich
mode
of
life
and
profession
and
their
peculiarities
on
a
typical
occasion
he
stepped
out
of
his
carriage
walked
with
cloak
thrown
back
down
a
short
passage
through
cheering
crowds
over
a
pavement
which
was
covered
with
red
carpet
through
a
over
which
an
awning
had
been
erected
up
a
staircase
flanked
by
pairs
of
footmen
he
was
on
his
way
to
a
festival
dinner
covered
to
his
hips
with
orders
the
fringed
epaulettes
of
a
major
on
his
narrow
shoulders
and
was
followed
by
his
suite
along
the
gothic
corridor
of
the
town
hall
two
servants
hurried
in
front
of
him
and
quickly
opened
an
old
window
which
rattled
in
its
lead
fastenings
for
down
below
in
the
stood
the
people
wedged
together
head
to
head
an
oblique
tract
of
upturned
faces
dimly
illuminated
by
smoky
torchlight
they
cheered
and
sang
and
he
stood
at
the
open
window
and
bowed
displayed
himself
to
the
general
enthusiasm
for
a
while
and
nodded
his
thanks
there
was
nothing
really
everyday
nor
was
there
anything
really
actual
about
his
life
it
consisted
of
a
succession
of
moments
of
enthusiasm
wherever
he
went
there
was
holiday
there
the
people
were
transfigured
and
glorified
there
the
grey
world
cleared
up
and
became
poetry
the
starveling
became
a
sleek
man
the
hovel
a
homely
cottage
dirty
changed
into
chaste
little
maidens
and
boys
in
sunday
clothes
their
hair
plastered
with
water
a
poem
on
their
lips
and
the
perspiring
citizen
in
and
was
moved
to
emotion
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
worth
but
not
only
he
klaus
heinrich
saw
the
world
in
this
light
but
it
saw
itself
too
as
long
as
his
presence
lasted
a
strange
unreality
and
speciousness
prevailed
in
places
where
he
exercised
his
calling
a
symmetrical
transitory
an
artificial
and
inspiring
disguising
of
the
reality
by
pasteboard
and
gilded
wood
by
garlands
lamps
draperies
and
bunting
was
conjured
up
for
one
fair
hour
and
he
himself
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
show
on
a
carpet
which
covered
the
bare
ground
between
masts
painted
in
two
colours
round
which
garlands
twined
stood
with
heels
together
in
the
odour
of
varnish
and
and
smiled
with
his
left
hand
planted
on
his
hip
he
laid
the
foundation
stone
of
a
new
town
hall
the
citizens
had
after
juggling
with
the
figures
got
together
the
necessary
sum
and
a
learned
architect
from
the
capital
had
been
entrusted
with
the
building
but
klaus
heinrich
undertook
the
laying
of
the
foundation
stone
amid
the
cheers
of
the
population
he
drove
up
to
the
noble
pavilion
which
had
been
built
on
the
site
stepped
lightly
and
collectedly
out
of
the
open
carriage
on
to
the
ground
which
had
been
rolled
and
sprinkled
with
yellow
sand
and
walked
all
alone
towards
the
official
personages
in
and
white
ties
who
were
waiting
for
him
at
the
entrance
he
asked
for
the
architect
to
be
presented
to
him
and
in
full
view
of
the
public
and
with
the
officials
standing
with
fixed
smiles
round
him
he
conducted
a
conversation
with
him
for
five
full
minutes
a
conversation
of
weighty
commonplaces
about
the
advantages
of
the
different
styles
of
architecture
after
which
he
made
a
decided
movement
which
he
had
meditated
to
himself
beforehand
during
the
conversation
and
allowed
himself
to
be
conducted
over
the
carpet
and
plank
steps
to
his
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
middle
platform
there
in
his
chain
and
stars
one
foot
advanced
his
hands
crossed
on
his
sword
hilt
his
helmet
on
the
ground
beside
him
visible
to
the
holiday
crowd
on
every
side
he
sat
and
listened
with
calm
demeanour
to
the
lord
mayor
speech
thereupon
when
they
came
to
the
request
he
rose
walked
without
noticeable
precaution
and
without
looking
at
his
feet
down
the
steps
to
where
the
foundation
stone
lay
and
with
a
little
hammer
gave
three
slow
taps
to
the
block
of
sandstone
at
the
same
time
repeating
in
the
deep
hush
with
his
rather
sharp
voice
a
sentence
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
previously
impressed
upon
him
school
children
sang
in
shrill
chorus
and
klaus
heinrich
drove
away
on
the
anniversary
of
the
war
of
independence
he
marched
in
front
of
the
veterans
a
officer
shouted
in
a
voice
which
seemed
hoarse
with
the
smoke
of
gunpowder
halt
off
hats
eyes
right
and
they
stood
with
medals
and
crosses
on
their
coats
the
rough
beavers
in
their
hands
and
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
like
those
of
a
hound
as
he
walked
by
with
a
friendly
look
and
paused
by
one
or
two
to
ask
where
they
had
served
where
they
had
been
under
fire
he
attended
the
gymnastic
display
graced
the
sports
with
his
presence
and
had
the
victors
presented
to
him
for
a
short
conversation
the
lithe
athletic
youths
stood
awkwardly
before
him
just
after
they
had
done
the
most
astonishing
feats
and
klaus
heinrich
quickly
strung
together
a
few
technical
remarks
which
he
remembered
from
herr
zotte
and
which
he
uttered
with
great
fluency
the
while
he
hid
his
left
hand
he
attended
the
five
houses
fishing
festival
he
was
present
in
his
seat
of
honour
at
the
grimmburg
and
distributed
the
prizes
he
accepted
too
the
honorary
presidency
and
patronage
of
the
associated
rifle
competition
he
attended
the
of
the
privileged
grand
ducal
rifle
club
he
responded
cordially
to
the
toast
of
welcome
in
the
words
of
the
by
holding
the
silver
cup
for
one
moment
to
his
lips
and
then
with
heels
clapped
together
raising
it
towards
the
marksmen
thereupon
he
fired
several
shots
at
the
target
of
honour
concerning
which
there
was
nothing
said
in
the
reports
as
to
where
they
hit
next
ploughed
through
one
and
the
same
dialogue
with
three
successive
men
about
the
advantages
of
which
in
the
was
described
as
a
general
conversation
and
at
last
took
leave
with
a
hearty
good
luck
which
evoked
indescribable
enthusiasm
this
formula
had
been
whispered
to
him
at
the
last
moment
by
von
hühnemann
who
had
made
inquiries
on
the
subject
for
of
course
it
would
have
had
a
bad
effect
would
have
shattered
the
fair
illusion
of
technical
knowledge
and
serious
enthusiasm
if
klaus
heinrich
had
wished
the
marksmen
excelsior
and
the
alpine
club
every
time
as
a
general
rule
he
needed
in
the
exercise
of
his
calling
a
certain
amount
of
technical
knowledge
which
he
acquired
for
each
succeeding
occasion
with
a
view
to
applying
it
at
the
right
moment
and
in
suitable
form
it
consisted
preponderatingly
of
the
technical
terms
current
in
the
different
departments
of
human
activity
as
well
as
of
historical
dates
and
before
setting
out
on
an
official
expedition
klaus
heinrich
used
to
work
up
the
necessary
information
at
home
in
the
hermitage
with
the
help
of
pamphlets
and
oral
instructions
when
he
in
the
name
of
the
grand
duke
my
most
gracious
brother
unveiled
the
statue
of
johann
albrecht
at
knüppelsdorf
he
delivered
on
the
scene
of
festivities
directly
after
a
performance
by
the
massed
choirs
of
the
wreath
of
harmony
a
speech
in
which
everything
he
had
noted
down
about
knüppelsdorf
was
dragged
in
and
which
produced
the
delightful
impression
everywhere
that
he
had
busied
himself
all
his
life
with
nothing
so
much
as
the
historical
vicissitudes
of
that
hub
of
civilization
in
the
first
place
knüppelsdorf
was
a
city
and
klaus
heinrich
alluded
to
that
three
times
to
the
pride
of
the
inhabitants
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
city
of
knüppelsdorf
as
her
historical
past
witnessed
had
been
connected
by
bonds
of
loyalty
to
the
house
of
grimmburg
for
several
centuries
as
long
ago
as
the
fourteenth
century
he
said
langrave
heinrich
xv
the
rutensteiner
had
signalled
out
knüppelsdorf
for
special
favour
he
the
rutensteiner
had
lived
in
the
schloss
built
on
the
neighbouring
rutensteine
whose
girdle
of
proud
towers
and
strong
walls
had
sent
its
greeting
to
the
country
for
miles
round
then
he
reminded
his
hearers
how
through
inheritance
and
marriage
knüppelsdorf
had
at
last
come
into
the
branch
of
the
family
to
which
his
brother
and
he
himself
belonged
heavy
storms
had
in
the
course
of
years
burst
over
knüppelsdorf
years
of
war
conflagration
and
pestilence
had
visited
it
yet
it
had
always
risen
again
and
had
always
remained
loyal
to
the
house
of
its
hereditary
princes
and
this
characteristic
the
knüppelsdorf
of
proved
that
it
possessed
by
raising
a
memorial
to
his
klaus
heinrich
beloved
father
and
it
would
be
with
unusual
pleasure
that
he
would
report
to
his
gracious
brother
the
dazzling
and
hearty
reception
which
he
as
his
representative
had
here
experienced
the
veil
fell
the
massed
choirs
of
the
wreath
of
harmony
again
did
their
best
and
klaus
heinrich
stood
smiling
under
his
theatrical
tent
with
a
feeling
of
having
exhausted
his
store
of
knowledge
happy
in
the
certainty
that
nobody
dare
question
him
further
for
he
could
have
said
one
blessed
word
more
about
knüppelsdorf
how
tiring
his
life
was
how
strenuous
sometimes
he
felt
as
if
he
had
constantly
to
keep
upright
at
a
great
strain
to
his
elasticity
something
which
it
was
quite
impossible
or
possible
only
in
favourable
conditions
to
keep
upright
sometimes
his
calling
seemed
to
him
a
wretched
and
paltry
one
although
he
liked
it
and
gladly
undertook
every
expedition
required
of
him
in
his
representative
capacity
he
travelled
miles
to
an
agricultural
exhibition
travelled
in
a
badly
hung
cart
from
schloss
hermitage
to
the
station
where
the
premier
the
chief
of
police
and
the
directors
of
the
railway
company
awaited
him
at
the
saloon
carriage
he
travelled
for
an
hour
and
a
half
the
while
carrying
on
not
without
difficulty
a
conversation
with
the
grand
ducal
adjutants
who
had
been
attached
to
him
and
the
agricultural
commissioner
assistant
secretary
heckepfeng
a
severe
and
respectful
man
who
also
accompanied
him
then
he
reached
the
station
of
the
city
which
had
organized
the
agricultural
exhibition
the
mayor
with
a
chain
over
his
shoulders
was
awaiting
him
at
the
head
of
six
or
seven
other
official
persons
the
station
was
decorated
with
a
quantity
of
and
festoons
in
the
stood
the
plaster
busts
of
albrecht
and
klaus
heinrich
in
a
frame
of
greenery
the
public
behind
the
barriers
gave
three
cheers
and
the
bells
pealed
the
mayor
read
an
address
of
welcome
to
klaus
heinrich
he
thanked
him
he
said
brandishing
his
in
his
hand
he
thanked
him
on
behalf
of
the
city
for
all
the
favour
which
klaus
heinrich
brother
and
he
himself
showed
them
and
heartily
wished
him
a
long
and
blessed
reign
he
also
begged
the
prince
twice
over
graciously
to
crown
the
work
which
had
prospered
so
famously
under
his
patronage
and
to
open
the
agricultural
exhibition
this
mayor
bore
the
title
of
agricultural
councillor
a
fact
of
which
klaus
heinrich
had
been
apprised
and
on
account
of
which
he
addressed
him
thus
three
times
in
his
answer
he
said
that
he
was
delighted
that
the
work
of
the
agricultural
exhibition
had
prospered
so
famously
under
his
patronage
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
forgotten
that
he
was
patron
of
this
exhibition
he
had
come
to
put
the
finishing
touch
that
day
to
the
great
work
by
opening
the
exhibition
then
he
inquired
as
to
four
things
as
to
the
economical
circumstances
of
the
city
the
increase
in
the
population
in
recent
years
as
to
the
although
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
what
the
was
and
as
to
the
price
of
victuals
when
he
heard
that
the
price
of
victuals
was
high
he
viewed
the
matter
in
a
serious
light
and
that
of
course
was
all
he
could
do
nobody
expected
anything
more
of
him
and
it
came
as
a
comfort
to
everybody
that
he
had
viewed
the
high
prices
in
a
serious
light
then
the
mayor
presented
the
city
dignitaries
to
him
the
higher
district
judge
a
noble
landed
proprietor
from
the
neighbourhood
the
rector
the
two
doctors
and
a
forwarding
agent
and
klaus
heinrich
addressed
a
question
to
each
thinking
over
while
the
answer
came
what
he
should
say
to
the
next
the
local
veterinary
surgeon
and
the
local
inspector
of
were
also
present
finally
they
climbed
into
carriages
and
drove
amid
the
cheers
of
the
inhabitants
between
fences
of
firemen
the
patriotic
societies
through
the
gaily
decked
city
to
the
exhibition
ground
not
without
being
stopped
once
more
at
the
gate
by
maidens
with
wreaths
on
their
heads
one
of
whom
the
mayor
daughter
handed
to
the
prince
in
his
carriage
a
bouquet
with
white
satin
streamers
and
in
lasting
memory
of
the
moment
received
one
of
those
pretty
and
valuable
which
klaus
heinrich
took
with
him
on
his
journeys
a
embedded
for
a
reason
she
could
not
guess
in
sammet
which
figured
in
the
as
a
jewel
mounted
in
gold
tents
pavilions
and
stands
had
been
erected
on
the
ground
gaudy
pennons
fluttered
on
long
rows
of
poles
strung
together
with
festoons
on
a
wooden
platform
hung
with
bunting
between
drapings
festoons
and
flagstaffs
klaus
heinrich
read
the
short
opening
speech
and
then
began
the
tour
of
inspection
there
were
cattle
tethered
to
low
crossbars
prize
beasts
of
the
best
blood
with
smooth
round
particoloured
bodies
and
numbered
shields
on
their
broad
foreheads
there
were
horses
stamping
and
snuffing
heavy
with
roman
noses
and
bushes
of
hair
round
their
pasterns
as
well
as
slender
restless
saddle
horses
there
were
naked
pigs
and
a
large
selection
of
both
ordinary
and
prize
pigs
with
dangling
bellies
they
grubbed
up
the
ground
with
their
snouts
while
great
blocks
of
woolly
sheep
filled
the
air
with
a
confused
chorus
of
bass
and
treble
there
were
exhibits
of
poultry
cocks
and
hens
of
every
kind
from
the
big
brahmaputra
to
the
bantam
ducks
and
pigeons
of
all
sorts
eggs
and
fodder
both
fresh
and
artificially
preserved
there
were
exhibits
of
agricultural
produce
grain
of
all
sorts
beets
and
clover
potatoes
peas
and
flax
vegetables
too
both
fresh
and
dried
raw
and
preserved
fruit
berries
marmalade
and
syrups
lastly
there
were
exhibits
of
agricultural
implements
and
machines
displayed
by
several
technical
firms
provided
with
everything
of
service
to
agriculture
from
the
to
the
great
motors
looking
like
elephants
in
their
stall
from
the
simplest
and
most
intelligible
objects
to
those
which
consisted
of
a
maze
of
wheels
chains
rods
cylinders
arms
and
teeth
a
world
an
entire
overpowering
world
of
ingenious
utility
klaus
heinrich
looked
at
everything
he
walked
with
his
on
his
forearm
down
the
rows
of
animals
cages
sacks
tubs
glasses
and
implements
the
dignitary
at
his
side
pointed
with
his
hand
to
this
and
that
venturing
on
a
remark
from
time
to
time
and
klaus
heinrich
acted
up
to
his
calling
he
expressed
in
words
his
appreciation
of
all
he
saw
stopped
from
time
to
time
and
engaged
the
exhibitors
of
the
animals
in
conversation
inquired
in
an
affable
way
into
their
circumstances
and
put
questions
to
the
country
people
whose
answers
entailed
a
scratching
behind
their
ears
and
as
he
walked
he
bowed
his
thanks
on
both
sides
for
the
homage
of
the
population
which
lined
his
path
the
people
had
collected
most
thickly
at
the
exit
where
the
carriages
were
waiting
in
order
to
watch
him
drive
off
a
way
was
kept
free
for
him
a
straight
passage
to
the
step
of
his
landau
and
he
walked
quickly
down
it
bowing
continuously
with
his
hand
to
his
helmet
alone
and
formally
separated
from
all
those
men
who
in
honouring
him
were
cheering
their
own
archetype
their
standard
and
of
whose
lives
work
and
ability
he
was
the
splendid
representative
though
not
participator
with
a
light
and
free
step
he
mounted
the
carriage
settled
himself
artistically
so
that
he
at
once
assumed
a
perfectly
graceful
and
pose
and
drove
saluting
as
he
went
to
the
clubhouse
where
luncheon
was
prepared
during
luncheon
indeed
directly
after
the
second
course
the
district
judge
proposed
the
health
of
the
grand
duke
and
the
prince
whereupon
klaus
heinrich
at
once
rose
to
drink
to
the
welfare
of
the
county
and
city
after
the
luncheon
however
he
retired
to
the
room
which
the
mayor
had
put
at
his
disposal
in
his
official
residence
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
for
an
hour
for
the
exercise
of
his
calling
exhausted
him
in
a
strange
degree
and
that
afternoon
he
was
due
not
only
to
visit
in
that
city
the
church
the
school
and
various
factories
especially
behnke
brothers
cheese
factory
and
to
express
high
satisfaction
with
everything
but
also
to
extend
his
journey
and
visit
a
scene
of
disaster
a
village
in
order
to
express
to
the
villagers
his
brother
and
his
own
sympathy
and
to
cheer
the
afflicted
by
his
exalted
presence
when
he
got
back
to
the
hermitage
to
his
soberly
furnished
empire
room
he
read
the
newspaper
accounts
of
his
expeditions
then
privy
councillor
schustermann
of
the
press
bureau
which
was
under
the
home
secretary
appeared
in
the
hermitage
and
brought
the
extracts
from
the
papers
cleanly
pasted
on
white
sheets
dated
and
labelled
with
the
name
of
the
paper
and
klaus
heinrich
read
about
the
impression
he
had
produced
read
about
his
personal
graciousness
and
highness
read
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
nobly
and
taken
the
hearts
of
young
and
old
by
storm
that
he
had
raised
the
minds
of
the
people
out
of
the
ruck
of
everyday
and
filled
them
with
gladness
and
affection
and
then
he
gave
free
audiences
in
the
old
schloss
as
it
had
been
arranged
the
custom
of
free
audiences
had
been
introduced
by
a
ancestor
of
albrecht
ii
and
the
people
clung
to
it
once
every
week
albrecht
or
klaus
in
his
place
was
accessible
to
everybody
whether
the
petitioner
was
a
man
of
rank
or
not
whether
the
subject
of
his
petitions
were
of
a
public
or
personal
nature
he
had
only
to
give
in
his
name
to
herr
von
bühl
or
even
the
on
duty
and
he
was
given
an
opportunity
of
bringing
his
matter
to
notice
in
the
highest
quarters
indeed
an
admirable
custom
for
it
meant
that
the
petitioner
did
not
have
to
go
round
by
way
of
a
written
application
with
the
dismal
prospect
of
his
petition
disappearing
for
ever
into
a
but
had
the
happy
assurance
that
his
application
would
go
straight
to
the
most
exalted
quarters
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
most
exalted
quarters
klaus
heinrich
at
this
time
naturally
were
not
in
a
position
to
go
into
the
matter
to
scrutinize
it
seriously
and
to
come
to
a
decision
upon
it
but
that
they
handed
the
matter
on
to
the
in
which
it
disappeared
but
the
custom
was
none
the
less
helpful
though
not
in
the
sense
of
utility
the
citizen
the
petitioner
came
to
herr
von
bühl
with
the
request
to
be
received
and
a
day
and
hour
were
fixed
for
him
with
glad
embarrassment
he
saw
the
day
draw
near
worked
up
in
his
own
mind
the
sentences
in
which
he
intended
to
explain
his
business
had
his
and
his
hat
ironed
put
on
his
best
shirt
and
generally
made
himself
ready
but
in
reality
these
solemn
interviews
were
well
calculated
to
turn
the
petitioner
thoughts
away
from
the
gross
material
end
in
view
and
to
make
the
reception
itself
seem
to
him
the
main
point
the
essential
object
of
his
excited
anticipation
the
hour
came
and
the
citizen
took
what
he
never
otherwise
took
a
cab
in
order
not
to
dirty
his
clean
boots
he
drove
between
the
lions
at
the
albrechtstor
and
the
sentries
as
well
as
the
stalwart
doorkeeper
gave
him
free
passage
he
landed
in
the
courtyard
at
the
colonnade
in
front
of
the
entrance
and
was
at
once
admitted
by
a
lackey
in
a
brown
coat
and
gaiters
to
an
on
the
ground
floor
to
the
left
in
one
corner
of
which
was
a
stand
of
colours
and
where
a
number
of
other
supplicants
talking
in
low
whispers
waited
in
a
state
of
thoughtful
tension
for
their
reception
the
holding
a
list
of
those
with
appointments
went
backwards
and
forwards
and
took
the
next
on
the
list
to
one
side
to
instruct
him
in
a
low
voice
how
to
behave
in
a
neighbouring
room
called
the
free
audience
room
klaus
heinrich
in
his
tunic
with
silver
collar
and
several
stars
stood
at
a
round
table
with
three
golden
legs
and
received
major
von
platow
gave
him
some
superficial
information
about
the
identity
of
each
petitioner
called
the
man
in
and
came
back
in
the
pauses
to
prompt
the
prince
in
a
few
words
about
the
next
comer
and
the
citizen
walked
in
with
the
blood
in
his
head
and
perspiring
slightly
he
stood
before
klaus
heinrich
it
had
been
impressed
on
him
that
he
was
not
to
go
too
near
his
royal
highness
but
must
keep
at
a
certain
distance
that
he
must
not
speak
without
being
spoken
to
and
even
then
must
not
gabble
off
all
he
had
to
say
but
answer
concisely
so
as
to
leave
the
prince
material
for
his
questions
that
he
must
at
the
conclusion
withdraw
backwards
and
without
showing
the
prince
his
backside
the
result
was
that
the
citizen
whole
attention
was
centred
on
not
breaking
any
of
the
rules
given
him
but
for
his
part
contributing
to
the
smooth
and
harmonious
progress
of
the
interview
klaus
heinrich
questioned
him
in
the
same
way
as
he
was
wont
to
question
the
veterans
the
marksmen
the
gymnasts
the
countrymen
and
the
victims
of
the
fire
smiling
and
with
his
left
hand
planted
well
back
on
his
hip
and
the
citizen
too
smiled
involuntarily
and
was
imbued
with
a
feeling
as
if
that
smile
lifted
him
far
above
the
troubles
which
had
held
him
prisoner
that
common
man
whose
spirit
otherwise
cleaved
to
the
dust
who
gave
a
thought
to
nothing
not
even
to
everyday
politeness
beyond
what
was
purely
utilitarian
and
had
come
here
too
with
a
definite
object
in
view
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
there
was
something
higher
than
business
and
his
business
in
particular
and
he
left
the
schloss
elevated
purified
with
eyes
dim
with
emotion
and
the
smile
still
on
his
flushed
face
that
was
the
way
in
which
klaus
heinrich
gave
free
audiences
that
the
way
in
which
he
exercised
his
exalted
calling
he
lived
at
the
hermitage
in
his
little
refuge
the
empire
room
which
was
furnished
so
stiffly
and
meagrely
with
cool
indifference
to
comfort
and
intimacy
faded
silk
covered
the
walls
above
the
white
wainscot
glass
chandeliers
hung
from
the
ugly
ceiling
sofas
mostly
without
tables
and
stands
supporting
marble
clocks
stood
along
the
walls
pairs
of
chairs
with
oval
backs
and
thin
silk
upholstery
flanked
the
and
in
the
corner
stood
bearing
candelabra
that
was
how
klaus
heinrich
room
looked
and
its
master
harmonized
well
with
it
he
lived
a
detached
and
quiet
life
feeling
no
enthusiasm
or
zeal
for
questions
on
which
the
public
differed
as
representative
of
his
brother
he
opened
parliament
but
he
took
no
personal
part
in
its
proceedings
and
avoided
the
yeas
and
nays
of
party
divisions
with
the
disinterestedness
and
want
of
convictions
proper
to
one
whose
position
was
above
all
parties
everybody
recognized
that
his
station
imposed
reserve
upon
him
but
many
were
of
opinion
that
want
of
interest
was
rather
repellently
and
insultingly
visible
in
his
whole
bearing
many
who
came
in
contact
with
him
described
him
as
cold
and
when
doctor
ueberbein
loudly
refuted
this
coldness
people
wondered
whether
the
and
morose
man
was
qualified
to
form
an
opinion
on
the
point
of
course
there
were
occasions
when
klaus
heinrich
glance
met
looks
which
refused
to
recognize
him
bold
scornful
invidious
looks
which
showed
contempt
for
and
ignorance
of
all
his
actions
and
exertions
but
even
in
the
loyal
people
who
showed
themselves
ready
to
esteem
and
honour
his
life
he
remarked
at
times
after
a
short
while
a
certain
exhaustion
indeed
irritation
as
if
they
could
no
longer
breathe
in
the
atmosphere
of
his
existence
and
that
worried
klaus
heinrich
though
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
prevent
it
he
had
no
place
in
the
everyday
world
a
greeting
from
him
a
gracious
word
a
winning
and
yet
dignified
wave
of
the
hand
were
all
weighty
and
decisive
incidents
once
he
was
returning
in
cap
and
greatcoat
from
a
ride
was
riding
slowly
on
his
brown
horse
florian
down
the
birch
avenue
which
skirted
the
and
led
to
the
park
and
the
hermitage
and
in
front
of
him
there
walked
a
shabbily
dressed
young
man
with
a
fur
cap
and
a
ridiculous
tuft
of
hair
on
his
neck
sleeves
and
trousers
that
were
too
short
for
him
and
unusually
large
feet
which
he
turned
inwards
as
he
walked
he
looked
like
the
student
of
a
technical
institute
or
something
of
that
sort
for
he
carried
a
under
his
arm
on
which
was
pinned
a
big
drawing
a
symmetrical
maze
of
lines
in
red
and
black
ink
a
projection
or
something
of
the
sort
klaus
heinrich
held
his
horse
back
behind
the
young
man
for
a
good
while
and
examined
the
red
and
black
projection
on
the
sometimes
he
thought
how
nice
it
must
be
to
have
a
proper
surname
to
be
called
doctor
smith
and
to
have
a
serious
calling
he
played
his
part
at
court
functions
the
big
and
small
balls
the
dinner
the
concerts
and
the
great
court
he
joined
in
autumn
in
the
court
shoots
with
his
cousins
and
his
suite
for
sake
and
although
his
left
arm
made
shooting
difficult
for
him
he
was
often
seen
in
the
evening
in
the
court
theatre
in
his
between
the
two
female
sculptures
with
the
crossed
hands
and
the
stern
empty
faces
for
the
theatre
attracted
him
he
loved
it
loved
to
look
at
the
players
to
watch
how
they
behaved
walked
off
and
on
and
went
through
with
their
parts
as
a
rule
he
thought
them
bad
rough
in
the
means
they
employed
to
please
and
unpractised
in
the
more
subtle
dissembling
of
the
natural
and
artless
for
the
rest
he
was
disposed
to
prefer
humble
and
popular
scenes
to
the
exalted
and
ceremonious
a
soubrette
called
mizzi
meyer
was
engaged
at
the
vaudeville
theatre
in
the
capital
who
in
the
newspapers
and
on
the
lips
of
the
public
was
never
called
anything
but
our
meyer
because
of
her
boundless
popularity
with
high
and
low
she
was
not
beautiful
hardly
pretty
her
voice
was
a
screech
and
strictly
speaking
she
could
lay
claim
to
no
special
gifts
and
yet
she
had
only
to
come
on
to
the
stage
to
evoke
storms
of
approbation
applause
and
encouragement
for
this
fair
and
compact
person
with
her
blue
eyes
her
broad
high
her
healthy
jolly
even
a
little
uproarious
manner
was
flesh
of
the
people
flesh
and
blood
of
their
blood
so
long
as
she
dressed
up
painted
and
lighted
up
from
every
side
faced
the
crowd
from
the
boards
she
was
in
very
deed
the
glorification
of
the
people
itself
indeed
the
people
clapped
itself
when
it
clapped
her
and
in
that
alone
lay
mizzi
meyer
power
over
men
souls
klaus
heinrich
was
very
fond
of
going
with
herr
von
to
the
vaudeville
when
mizzi
meyer
was
playing
and
joined
heartily
in
the
applause
one
day
he
had
a
rencontre
which
on
the
one
hand
gave
him
food
for
thought
on
the
other
disillusioned
him
it
was
with
martini
axel
martini
the
compiler
of
the
two
books
of
poetry
which
had
been
so
much
praised
by
the
experts
evoë
and
the
holy
life
the
meeting
came
about
in
the
following
way
in
the
capital
lived
a
wealthy
old
man
a
privy
councillor
who
since
his
retirement
from
the
state
service
had
devoted
his
life
to
the
advancement
of
the
fine
arts
especially
poetry
he
was
founder
of
what
was
known
as
the
a
poetical
tournament
which
recurred
every
year
in
springtime
to
which
the
privy
councillor
invited
poets
and
poetesses
by
circulars
and
posters
prizes
were
offered
for
the
tenderest
the
most
fervent
religious
poem
the
most
ardent
patriotic
song
for
the
happiest
lyrical
effusions
in
praise
of
music
the
forest
the
spring
the
joy
of
life
and
these
prizes
consisted
of
sums
of
money
supplemented
by
judicious
and
valuable
souvenirs
such
as
golden
pens
golden
in
the
form
of
lyres
or
flowers
and
more
of
the
same
kind
the
city
authorities
also
had
founded
a
prize
and
the
grand
duke
gave
a
silver
cup
as
a
reward
for
the
most
absolutely
admirable
of
all
poems
sent
in
the
founder
of
the
himself
who
was
responsible
for
the
first
the
always
numerous
entries
shared
with
two
university
professors
and
the
editors
of
the
literary
supplements
of
the
and
the
the
duties
of
the
and
the
highly
commended
entries
were
printed
and
published
regularly
in
the
form
of
an
annual
at
the
expense
of
the
privy
councillor
now
axel
martini
had
taken
part
in
the
this
year
and
had
come
off
victorious
the
poem
which
he
had
sent
in
an
inspired
hymn
of
praise
to
the
joy
of
life
or
rather
a
highly
tempestuous
outbreak
of
the
joy
of
life
itself
a
ravishing
hymn
to
the
beauty
and
awfulness
of
life
was
conceived
in
the
style
of
both
his
books
and
had
given
rise
to
discord
in
the
board
of
judges
the
privy
councillor
himself
and
the
professor
of
philology
had
been
for
dismissing
it
with
a
notice
of
commendation
for
they
considered
it
exaggerated
in
expression
coarse
in
its
passion
and
in
places
frankly
repulsive
but
the
professor
of
literary
history
together
with
the
editors
had
them
not
only
in
view
of
the
fact
that
martini
contribution
represented
the
best
poem
to
the
joy
of
life
but
also
in
consideration
of
its
undeniable
and
in
the
end
their
two
opponents
too
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
appeal
of
its
foaming
and
stunning
flow
of
words
so
axel
martini
had
been
awarded
fifteen
pounds
a
gold
in
the
form
of
a
lyre
and
the
grand
duke
silver
cup
as
well
and
his
poem
had
been
printed
first
in
the
annual
surrounded
with
an
artistic
frame
from
the
hand
of
professor
von
lindemann
what
was
more
the
custom
was
for
the
victor
or
victrix
in
the
to
be
received
in
audience
by
the
grand
duke
and
as
albrecht
was
unwell
this
task
fell
to
his
brother
klaus
heinrich
was
a
little
afraid
of
herr
martini
oh
dear
doctor
ueberbein
he
said
when
he
met
his
tutor
one
day
what
subject
am
i
to
tackle
him
on
he
sure
to
be
a
wild
fellow
but
doctor
ueberbein
answered
anything
but
klaus
heinrich
you
need
not
worry
he
a
very
decent
fellow
i
know
him
i
rather
in
with
his
set
you
get
on
splendidly
with
him
so
klaus
heinrich
received
the
poet
of
the
joy
of
life
received
him
at
the
hermitage
so
as
to
give
the
business
as
private
a
character
as
possible
in
the
yellow
room
braunbart
if
you
please
he
said
that
the
most
presentable
one
for
occasions
like
this
there
were
three
handsome
chairs
in
this
room
which
indeed
were
the
only
valuable
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
schloss
heavy
empire
of
mahogany
with
spiral
arms
and
yellow
upholstery
on
which
lyres
were
embroidered
klaus
heinrich
on
this
occasion
did
not
dispose
himself
ready
for
an
audience
but
waited
in
some
anxiety
near
by
until
axel
martini
on
his
side
had
waited
for
seven
or
eight
minutes
in
the
yellow
room
then
he
walked
in
hastily
almost
hurriedly
and
advanced
towards
the
poet
who
made
a
low
bow
i
am
very
much
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
said
dear
sir
dear
doctor
i
believe
no
royal
highness
answered
axel
martini
in
an
asthmatic
voice
not
doctor
i
no
title
oh
forgive
me
i
assumed
let
sit
down
dear
herr
martini
i
am
as
i
have
said
delighted
to
be
able
to
congratulate
you
on
your
great
success
herr
martini
drew
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
mahogany
at
the
uncovered
table
round
whose
edge
ran
a
gold
border
and
crossed
his
feet
which
were
cased
in
cracked
boots
he
was
in
and
wore
yellow
gloves
his
collar
was
frayed
at
the
edges
he
had
rather
staring
eyes
thin
cheeks
and
a
dark
yellow
moustache
which
was
clipped
like
a
hedge
his
hair
was
already
quite
grey
on
the
temples
although
according
to
the
annual
he
was
not
more
than
thirty
years
old
and
under
his
eyes
glowed
patches
of
red
which
did
not
suggest
robust
health
he
answered
to
klaus
heinrich
congratulations
your
royal
highness
is
very
kind
it
was
not
a
difficult
victory
perhaps
it
was
hardly
tactful
of
me
to
compete
klaus
heinrich
did
not
understand
this
but
he
said
i
have
read
your
poem
repeatedly
with
great
pleasure
it
seems
to
me
a
complete
success
as
regards
both
metre
and
rhyme
and
it
entirely
expresses
the
of
life
herr
martini
bowed
in
his
chair
your
skill
continued
klaus
heinrich
must
be
a
source
of
great
pleasure
to
you
an
ideal
recreation
what
is
your
calling
herr
martini
herr
martini
showed
that
he
did
not
understand
by
describing
a
note
of
interrogation
with
the
upper
half
of
his
body
i
mean
your
main
calling
are
you
in
the
civil
service
no
royal
highness
i
have
no
calling
i
occupy
myself
exclusively
with
poetry
none
at
all
oh
i
understand
so
unusual
a
gift
deserves
that
a
man
whole
powers
be
devoted
to
it
i
do
know
about
that
royal
highness
whether
it
deserves
it
or
not
i
do
know
i
must
own
that
i
had
no
choice
i
have
always
felt
myself
entirely
unsuited
to
every
other
branch
of
human
activity
it
seems
to
me
that
this
undoubted
and
unconditional
unsuitability
for
everything
else
is
the
sole
proof
and
touchstone
of
the
poetical
calling
indeed
that
a
man
must
not
see
in
poetry
any
calling
but
only
the
expression
and
refuge
of
that
unsuitability
it
was
a
peculiarity
with
herr
martini
that
when
he
talked
tears
came
into
his
eyes
just
like
a
man
who
comes
out
of
the
cold
into
a
warm
room
and
lets
the
heat
stream
through
and
melt
his
limbs
that
a
singular
idea
said
klaus
heinrich
not
at
all
royal
highness
i
beg
your
pardon
no
not
singular
at
all
it
an
idea
which
is
very
generally
accepted
what
i
say
is
nothing
new
and
for
how
long
have
you
been
living
only
for
poetry
i
suppose
you
were
once
a
student
not
exactly
royal
highness
no
the
unsuitability
to
which
i
alluded
before
began
to
show
itself
in
me
at
an
early
age
i
could
get
on
at
school
i
left
it
without
passing
my
i
went
up
to
the
university
with
the
full
intention
of
taking
it
later
but
i
never
did
and
when
my
first
volume
of
poems
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
it
no
longer
suited
my
dignity
to
do
so
if
i
may
say
so
of
course
not
but
did
your
parents
then
agree
to
your
choice
of
a
career
oh
no
royal
highness
i
must
say
to
my
parents
credit
that
they
by
no
means
agreed
to
it
i
come
of
a
good
stock
my
father
was
solicitor
to
the
treasury
he
dead
now
but
he
was
solicitor
to
the
treasury
he
naturally
disliked
my
choice
of
a
career
so
much
that
till
his
death
he
would
never
give
me
a
farthing
i
lived
at
daggers
drawn
with
him
although
i
had
the
greatest
respect
for
him
because
of
his
strictness
oh
so
you
had
a
hard
time
of
it
herr
martini
you
had
to
struggle
through
i
can
well
believe
that
you
must
have
knocked
about
a
good
deal
not
so
royal
highness
no
that
would
have
been
horrid
i
have
stood
it
my
health
is
delicate
i
dare
not
say
for
i
am
convinced
that
my
talent
is
inseparably
connected
with
my
bodily
infirmity
neither
my
body
nor
my
talent
could
have
survived
hunger
and
harsh
winds
and
they
have
not
had
to
survive
them
my
mother
was
weak
enough
to
provide
me
behind
my
father
back
with
the
means
of
life
modest
but
adequate
means
i
owe
it
to
her
that
my
talent
has
been
able
to
develop
under
fairly
favourable
conditions
the
result
has
shown
herr
martini
that
they
were
the
right
conditions
although
it
is
difficult
to
say
now
what
actually
are
good
conditions
permit
me
to
suppose
that
if
your
mother
had
shown
herself
as
strict
as
your
father
and
you
had
been
alone
in
the
world
and
left
entirely
to
your
own
resources
do
you
think
that
it
might
have
been
to
a
certain
extent
a
good
thing
for
you
that
you
might
have
got
a
peep
at
things
so
to
speak
which
have
escaped
you
as
it
is
people
like
me
royal
highness
get
peeps
enough
without
having
actually
to
know
what
hunger
is
and
the
idea
is
fairly
generally
accepted
that
it
is
not
actual
hunger
but
rather
hunger
for
the
actual
ha
ha
which
talent
requires
herr
martini
had
been
obliged
to
laugh
a
little
at
his
play
upon
words
he
now
quickly
raised
one
hand
to
his
mouth
with
the
moustache
and
improved
his
laugh
into
a
cough
klaus
heinrich
watched
him
with
a
look
of
princely
expectancy
if
your
royal
highness
will
allow
me
it
is
a
fact
that
the
want
of
actuality
for
such
as
me
is
the
of
all
talent
the
fountain
of
inspiration
indeed
our
suggestive
genius
enjoyment
of
life
is
forbidden
to
us
strictly
forbidden
we
have
no
illusions
as
to
that
and
by
enjoyment
of
life
i
mean
not
only
happiness
but
also
sorrow
passion
in
short
every
serious
tie
with
life
the
representation
of
life
claims
all
our
forces
especially
when
those
forces
are
not
allotted
to
us
in
overabundant
measure
and
herr
martini
coughed
drawing
his
shoulders
repeatedly
forward
as
he
did
so
renunciation
he
added
is
our
compact
with
the
muse
in
it
reposes
our
strength
our
value
and
life
is
our
forbidden
garden
our
great
temptation
to
which
we
yield
sometimes
but
never
to
our
profit
the
flow
of
words
had
again
brought
tears
to
herr
martini
eyes
he
tried
to
blink
them
away
every
one
of
us
he
went
on
knows
what
it
is
to
make
mistakes
to
run
off
the
rails
in
that
way
to
make
greedy
excursions
of
that
kind
into
the
festival
halls
of
life
but
we
return
thence
into
our
isolation
humbled
and
sick
at
heart
herr
martini
stopped
his
look
from
under
his
knotted
brows
became
fixed
for
a
moment
and
lost
in
vacancy
while
his
mouth
assumed
a
sour
expression
and
his
cheeks
on
which
the
unhealthy
redness
glowed
seemed
even
thinner
than
before
it
was
only
for
a
second
then
he
changed
his
position
and
his
eyes
recovered
their
vivacity
but
your
poem
said
klaus
heinrich
with
some
your
prize
poem
to
the
of
life
herr
martini
i
am
really
grateful
to
you
for
your
achievement
but
will
you
please
tell
me
your
poem
i
read
it
attentively
it
deals
on
the
one
hand
with
misery
and
horrors
with
the
wickedness
and
cruelty
of
life
if
i
remember
rightly
and
on
the
other
hand
with
the
enjoyment
of
wine
and
fair
women
does
it
not
herr
martini
laughed
then
rubbed
the
corners
of
his
mouth
with
his
thumb
and
forefinger
so
as
to
wipe
the
laugh
out
and
it
all
said
klaus
heinrich
conceived
in
the
form
of
in
the
first
person
is
it
and
yet
it
is
not
founded
on
personal
knowledge
you
have
not
really
experienced
any
of
it
yourself
very
little
royal
highness
only
quite
trifling
suggestions
of
it
no
the
fact
is
the
other
way
round
that
if
i
were
the
man
to
experience
all
that
i
should
not
only
not
write
such
poems
but
should
also
feel
entire
contempt
for
my
present
existence
i
have
a
friend
his
name
is
weber
he
a
rich
young
man
he
lives
he
enjoys
his
life
his
favourite
amusement
consists
in
scorching
in
his
motor
car
at
a
mad
pace
over
the
country
and
picking
up
village
girls
from
the
roads
and
fields
on
the
way
with
whom
he
but
that
another
story
in
short
that
young
man
laughs
when
he
catches
sight
of
me
he
finds
something
so
comic
in
me
and
my
activities
but
as
for
me
i
can
quite
understand
his
amusement
and
envy
him
it
i
dare
say
that
i
too
despise
him
a
little
but
not
so
much
as
i
envy
and
admire
him
you
admire
him
certainly
royal
highness
i
can
not
help
doing
so
he
spends
he
squanders
he
lets
himself
go
in
a
most
unconcerned
and
way
while
it
is
my
lot
to
save
anxiously
and
greedily
to
keep
together
and
indeed
to
do
so
on
hygienic
grounds
for
hygiene
is
what
i
and
such
as
i
most
need
it
is
our
whole
ethics
but
nothing
is
more
unhygienic
than
life
that
means
that
you
will
never
empty
the
grand
duke
cup
then
herr
martini
drink
wine
out
of
it
no
royal
highness
although
it
would
be
fine
to
do
so
but
i
never
touch
wine
and
i
go
to

at
ten
and
generally
take
care
of
myself
if
i
did
i
should
never
have
won
the
cup
i
can
well
believe
it
herr
martini
people
who
are
not
behind
the
scenes
get
strange
ideas
of
what
a
poet
life
must
be
like
quite
conceivably
royal
highness
but
it
is
taken
all
round
by
no
means
a
very
glorious
life
i
can
assure
you
especially
as
we
poets
every
hour
of
the
in
order
that
a
poem
of
that
sort
may
come
into
existence
from
time
to
time
who
would
believe
how
much
idleness
and
boredom
and
peevish
laziness
is
necessary
the
motto
on
a
picture
postcard
is
often
a
whole
day
work
we
sleep
a
lot
we
idle
about
with
heads
feeling
like
lead
yes
it
too
often
a
dog
life
some
one
knocked
lightly
on
the
door
it
was
signal
that
it
was
high
time
for
klaus
heinrich
to
change
his
clothes
and
have
himself
freshened
up
for
there
was
to
be
a
club
concert
that
evening
in
the
old
schloss
klaus
heinrich
rose
i
been
gossiping
he
said
for
that
was
the
expression
he
used
at
such
moments
and
then
he
dismissed
herr
martini
wished
him
success
in
his
poetical
career
and
accompanied
the
respectful
withdrawal
with
a
laugh
and
that
rather
theatrical
up
and
down
movement
of
the
hand
which
was
not
always
equally
effective
but
which
he
had
brought
to
a
high
pitch
of
perfection
such
was
the
prince
conversation
with
axel
martini
the
author
of
evoë
and
the
holy
life
it
gave
him
food
for
thought
it
continued
to
occupy
his
mind
after
it
had
ended
he
continued
to
think
over
it
while
neumann
was
reparting
his
hair
and
helping
him
on
with
the
dazzling
coat
with
the
stars
during
the
club
concert
at
court
and
for
several
days
afterwards
and
he
tried
to
reconcile
the
poet
statements
with
the
rest
of
the
experiences
which
life
had
vouchsafed
to
him
this
herr
martini
who
while
the
unhealthy
flush
glowed
under
his
eyes
kept
crying
how
beautiful
how
strong
is
life
yet
was
careful
to
go
to
bed
at
ten
shut
himself
off
from
life
on
hygienic
grounds
as
he
said
and
avoided
every
serious
tie
with
it
this
poet
with
his
frayed
collar
his
watery
eyes
and
his
envy
of
the
young
weber
who
scorched
over
the
country
with
village
girls
he
left
a
mixed
impression
it
was
difficult
to
come
to
any
certain
conclusion
about
him
klaus
heinrich
expressed
it
when
he
told
his
sister
of
the
meeting
by
saying
things
are
none
too
comfortable
and
easy
for
him
that
quite
obvious
and
that
certainly
entitles
him
to
our
sympathy
but
somehow
i
not
sure
if
i
glad
to
have
met
him
for
he
has
something
deterrent
about
him
ditlinde
yes
after
all
he
certainly
a
little
repulsive
vii
imma
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
had
been
well
informed
on
the
very
evening
of
the
day
on
which
she
had
brought
the
princess
zu
reid
the
great
news
the
published
the
announcement
of
samuel
spoelmann
the
spoelmann
impending
arrival
and
ten
days
later
at
the
beginning
of
october
it
was
the
october
of
the
year
in
which
grand
duke
albrecht
had
entered
his
and
prince
klaus
heinrich
his
year
thus
barely
giving
time
for
public
curiosity
to
reach
a
really
high
point
his
arrival
became
a
fact
a
plain
actuality
on
an
entirely
ordinary
which
was
destined
to
impress
itself
on
the
future
as
a
date
to
be
remembered
for
ever
the
spoelmanns
arrived
by
special
train
that
was
the
only
distinction
about
their
debut
to
start
with
for
everybody
knew
that
the
suite
in
the
spa
court
hotel
was
by
no
means
dazzlingly
magnificent
a
few
idlers
guarded
by
a
small
detachment
of
policemen
had
gathered
behind
the
platform
barriers
some
representatives
of
the
press
were
present
but
whoever
expected
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
was
disappointed
spoelmann
would
almost
have
passed
unrecognized
he
was
so
unimposing
for
a
long
time
people
took
his
family
physician
for
him
doctor
watercloose
people
said
he
was
called
a
tall
american
who
wore
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
kept
his
mouth
distended
in
a
perpetual
smile
between
his
white
whiskers
the
while
he
his
eyes
it
was
not
till
the
last
moment
that
people
learned
that
it
was
the
little
man
in
the
faded
overcoat
he
who
wore
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
who
was
the
actual
spoelmann
and
the
spectators
were
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
striking
about
him
all
sorts
of
stories
had
been
in
circulation
about
him
some
witty
fellow
had
spread
the
report
that
spoelmann
had
front
teeth
of
solid
gold
and
a
diamond
set
in
the
middle
of
each
but
although
the
truth
or
untruth
of
this
report
could
not
be
tested
at
once
for
spoelmann
did
not
show
his
teeth
he
did
not
laugh
but
rather
seemed
angry
and
irritated
by
his
infirmity
yet
when
they
saw
him
nobody
was
any
longer
inclined
to
believe
it
as
for
miss
spoelmann
his
daughter
she
had
turned
up
the
collar
of
her
fur
coat
and
stuffed
her
hands
in
the
pockets
so
that
there
was
hardly
anything
to
be
seen
of
her
except
a
pair
of
disproportionately
big
eyes
which
swept
the
crowd
with
a
serious
look
whose
meaning
it
was
hard
to
interpret
by
her
side
stood
the
person
whom
the
onlookers
identified
as
her
companion
the
countess
löwenjoul
a
woman
of
plainly
dressed
and
taller
than
either
of
the
spoelmanns
who
carried
her
little
head
with
its
thin
smooth
hair
pensively
on
one
side
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
in
front
of
her
with
a
kind
of
rigid
meekness
what
without
question
attracted
most
attention
was
a
scottish
which
was
led
on
a
cord
by
a
servant
an
exceptionally
handsome
but
as
it
appeared
terribly
excitable
beast
that
leaped
and
danced
and
filled
the
station
with
its
frenzied
barking
people
said
that
a
few
of
spoelmann
servants
male
and
female
had
already
arrived
at
the
spa
court
some
hours
before
at
any
rate
it
was
left
to
the
servant
with
the
dog
to
look
after
the
luggage
by
himself
and
while
he
was
doing
so
his
masters
drove
in
two
ordinary
flies
spoelmann
with
doctor
watercloose
miss
spoelmann
with
the
countess
to
the
there
they
got
out
and
there
for
six
weeks
they
led
a
life
the
cost
of
which
it
did
not
need
all
their
money
to
meet
they
were
lucky
the
weather
was
fine
it
was
a
blue
autumn
a
long
succession
of
sunny
days
from
october
into
november
and
miss
spoelmann
rode
daily
that
was
her
only
luxury
with
her
companion
on
horses
which
she
hired
by
the
week
from
the
livery
stables
spoelmann
did
not
ride
although
the
with
obvious
reference
to
him
published
a
note
by
its
medical
colleague
according
to
which
riding
had
a
soothing
effect
in
cases
of
stone
owing
to
its
jolting
and
helped
to
disperse
the
stone
but
the
hotel
staff
knew
that
the
famous
man
practised
artificial
riding
within
the
four
walls
of
his
room
with
the
help
of
a
machine
a
stationary
velocipede
to
whose
saddle
a
jolting
motion
was
imparted
by
the
working
of
the
pedals
he
was
a
zealous
drinker
of
the
healing
waters
the
ditlinde
spring
by
which
he
seemed
to
set
great
store
he
appeared
first
thing
every
morning
in
the
füllhaus
accompanied
by
his
daughter
who
for
her
part
was
quite
healthy
and
only
drank
with
him
for
company
sake
and
then
in
his
faded
coat
and
with
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
took
his
exercise
in
the
and
wandelhalle
drinking
the
water
the
while
through
a
glass
tube
out
of
a
blue
tumbler
watched
at
a
distance
by
the
two
american
newspaper
correspondents
whose
duty
it
was
to
telegraph
to
their
papers
a
thousand
words
daily
about
spoelmann
holiday
resort
and
who
were
therefore
bound
to
try
to
get
something
to
telegraph
about
otherwise
he
was
rarely
visible
his
illness
kidney
colic
so
people
said
extremely
painful
attacks
seemed
to
confine
him
often
to
his
room
if
not
to
his
bed
and
while
miss
spoelmann
with
countess
löwenjoul
appeared
two
or
three
times
at
the
court
theatre
when
in
a
black
velvet
dress
with
an
indian
silk
scarf
of
a
wonderful
colour
round
her
fresh
young
shoulders
she
looked
quite
bewitching
with
her
complexion
and
great
black
pleading
eyes
her
father
was
never
seen
in
the
box
with
her
he
took
it
is
true
in
her
company
one
or
two
drives
through
the
capital
to
do
some
shopping
get
some
idea
of
the
town
and
see
a
few
select
sights
he
went
for
a
walk
with
her
too
through
the
park
and
twice
inspected
there
the
schloss
delphinenort
the
second
time
alone
when
he
was
so
much
interested
as
to
take
measurements
of
the
walls
with
an
ordinary
yellow
rule
which
he
took
out
of
his
faded
coat
but
he
was
never
seen
in
the
of
the
spa
court
for
whether
because
he
was
on
an
almost
meatless
diet
or
for
some
other
reason
he
took
his
meals
exclusively
with
his
own
party
in
his
own
rooms
and
the
curiosity
of
the
public
had
on
the
whole
remarkably
little
to
feed
on
the
result
was
that
spoelmann
arrival
at
the
spa
at
first
did
not
prove
so
beneficial
as
fräulein
von
isenschnibbe
and
many
others
beside
her
had
expected
the
export
of
bottles
increased
that
was
certain
it
quickly
rose
to
half
as
many
again
as
its
previous
figure
and
remained
at
that
but
the
influx
of
foreigners
did
not
increase
noticeably
the
guests
who
came
to
feast
their
eyes
on
so
abnormal
an
existence
soon
went
away
again
satisfied
or
disappointed
besides
it
was
for
the
most
part
not
the
most
desirable
elements
of
society
that
were
attracted
by
the
millionaire
presence
strange
creatures
appeared
in
the
streets
unkempt
and
creatures
inventors
projectors
benefactors
of
mankind
who
hoped
to
enlist
spoelmann
sympathies
for
their
hobbies
but
the
millionaire
made
himself
absolutely
inaccessible
to
these
people
indeed
purple
with
rage
he
howled
at
one
of
them
who
made
advances
towards
him
in
the
park
in
such
a
way
that
the
busybody
quickly
skedaddled
and
it
was
often
said
that
the
torrent
of
begging
letters
which
daily
flowed
in
to
him
letters
which
often
bore
stamps
which
the
officials
of
the
grand
ducal
had
never
seen
before
was
at
once
discharged
into
a
of
quite
unusual
capacity
spoelmann
seemed
to
have
forbidden
all
business
letters
to
be
sent
him
seemed
determined
to
enjoy
his
holiday
to
the
utmost
and
during
his
travels
in
europe
to
live
exclusively
for
his
health
or
the
whose
reporter
had
lost
no
time
in
making
friends
with
his
american
colleagues
was
in
a
position
to
announce
that
a
reliable
man
a
chief
manager
was
spoelmann
representative
in
america
he
went
on
to
say
that
his
yacht
a
gorgeously
decorated
vessel
was
awaiting
the
great
man
at
venice
and
that
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
cure
he
intended
to
travel
south
with
his
party
it
told
also
in
answer
to
importunate
requests
from
its
readers
of
the
romantic
origin
of
the
spoelmann
millions
from
their
beginning
in
victoria
whither
his
father
had
drifted
from
some
german
office
stool
or
other
young
poor
and
armed
only
with
a
pick
a
shovel
and
a
tin
plate
there
he
had
begun
by
working
as
help
to
a
as
a
day
labourer
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
then
luck
had
come
to
him
a
man
a
on
a
small
scale
had
fared
so
badly
that
he
could
no
longer
buy
himself
his
tomatoes
and
dry
bread
for
dinner
and
in
his
extremity
had
been
obliged
to
dispose
of
his
claim
spoelmann
senior
had
bought
it
had
staked
his
one
card
and
with
his
whole
savings
amounting
to
sterling
had
bought
this
piece
of
alluvial
land
called
paradise
field
not
more
than
forty
feet
square
and
the
next
day
he
had
turned
up
a
foot
under
the
surface
a
nugget
of
pure
gold
the
tenth
biggest
nugget
in
the
world
the
paradise
nugget
weighing
ounces
and
worth
that
related
the
had
been
the
beginning
spoelmann
father
had
emigrated
to
south
america
with
the
proceeds
of
his
find
to
bolivia
and
as
and
had
continued
to
extract
the
yellow
metal
direct
from
the
rivers
and
the
womb
of
the
mountains
then
and
there
spoelmann
senior
had
married
and
the
went
so
far
as
to
hint
in
this
connexion
that
he
had
done
so
defiantly
and
without
regard
to
the
prejudices
generally
felt
in
those
parts
however
he
had
doubled
his
capital
and
succeeded
in
investing
his
money
most
profitably
he
had
moved
on
northwards
to
philadelphia
that
was
in
the
fifties
the
time
of
a
great
boom
in
railway
construction
and
spoelmann
had
begun
with
one
investment
in
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
he
had
also
leased
a
in
the
west
of
the
state
the
profits
from
which
had
been
enormous
finally
he
had
joined
that
group
of
fortunate
young
men
which
bought
the
famous
blockhead
farm
for
a
few
thousand
pounds
the
property
which
with
its
petroleum
wells
in
a
short
time
increased
in
value
to
a
hundred
times
its
purchase
price
this
enterprise
had
made
a
rich
man
of
spoelmann
senior
but
he
had
by
no
means
rested
on
his
oars
but
unceasingly
practised
the
art
of
making
money
into
more
money
and
finally
into
superabundant
money
he
had
started
steel
works
had
floated
companies
for
the
turning
of
iron
into
steel
on
a
large
scale
and
for
building
railway
bridges
he
had
bought
up
the
major
part
of
the
shares
of
four
or
five
big
railway
companies
and
had
been
elected
in
the
later
years
of
his
life
president
manager
or
director
of
the
companies
when
the
steel
trust
was
formed
so
the
said
he
had
joined
it
with
a
holding
of
shares
which
guaranteed
him
an
income
of
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
been
chief
shareholder
and
expert
adviser
of
the
petroleum
combine
and
in
virtue
of
his
holding
had
dominated
three
or
four
of
the
other
trust
companies
and
at
his
death
his
fortune
reckoned
in
german
currency
had
amounted
to
a
round
thousand
million
marks
samuel
his
only
son
the
offspring
of
that
early
marriage
contracted
in
defiance
of
public
opinion
had
been
his
sole
heir
and
the
with
its
usual
delicacy
interpolated
a
remark
to
the
effect
that
there
was
something
almost
sad
in
the
idea
of
any
one
without
himself
contributing
and
through
no
fault
of
his
own
being
born
to
such
a
situation
samuel
had
inherited
the
palace
on
fifth
avenue
at
new
york
the
country
mansions
and
all
the
shares
trust
bonds
and
profits
of
his
father
he
inherited
also
the
strange
position
to
which
his
father
had
risen
his
and
the
hatred
directed
by
his
competitors
against
the
power
of
his
gold
all
the
hatred
to
allay
which
he
yearly
distributed
his
huge
donations
to
colleges
conservatories
libraries
benevolent
institutions
and
that
university
which
his
father
had
founded
and
which
bore
his
name
samuel
spoelmann
did
not
deserve
the
hatred
of
the
competitors
that
the
was
sure
of
he
had
gone
early
into
the
business
and
had
controlled
the
bewildering
possessions
of
his
house
all
by
himself
during
his
father
last
years
but
everybody
knew
that
his
heart
had
never
been
really
in
the
business
his
real
inclinations
had
been
strange
to
say
all
along
much
more
towards
music
and
especially
organ
music
and
the
truth
of
this
information
on
the
part
of
the
was
certain
for
spoelmann
actually
kept
a
small
organ
in
the
spa
court
whose
bellows
he
got
a
hotel
servant
to
blow
and
he
could
be
heard
from
the
playing
it
for
an
hour
every
day
he
had
married
for
love
and
not
at
all
from
social
considerations
according
to
the
a
poor
and
pretty
girl
half
german
half
by
descent
she
had
died
but
she
had
left
him
a
daughter
that
wonderful
of
a
girl
whom
we
now
had
as
guest
within
our
walls
and
who
was
at
the
time
nineteen
years
old
her
name
was
imma
a
real
german
name
as
the
added
nothing
more
than
an
old
form
of
emma
and
it
might
be
remarked
that
the
daily
conversation
in
the
spoelmann
household
though
interlarded
with
scraps
of
english
had
remained
german
and
how
devoted
father
and
daughter
seemed
to
be
to
each
other
every
morning
by
going
to
the
at
the
right
time
one
could
watch
fräulein
spoelmann
who
usually
entered
the
füllhause
a
little
later
than
her
father
take
his
head
between
her
hands
and
give
him
his
morning
kiss
on
mouth
and
cheeks
while
he
patted
her
tenderly
on
the
back
then
they
went
through
the
wandelhalle
and
sucked
their
glass
tubes
as
they
went
that
is
how
the
journal
gossiped
and
fed
the
public
curiosity
it
also
reported
carefully
the
visits
which
miss
imma
kindly
paid
with
her
companion
to
several
of
the
charitable
institutions
of
the
town
yesterday
she
had
made
a
detailed
inspection
of
the
public
kitchens
she
had
made
a
prolonged
tour
of
the
trinity
almhouses
for
old
women
and
she
had
recently
twice
attended
privy
councillor
klinghammer
lectures
on
the
theory
of
numbers
at
the
university
had
sat
on
the
bench
a
student
among
students
and
scribbled
away
with
her
for
everybody
knew
that
she
was
a
learned
girl
and
devoted
to
the
study
of
algebra
yes
all
that
was
absorbing
reading
and
furnished
ample
food
for
conversation
but
the
topics
which
made
themselves
talked
about
without
any
help
from
the
were
firstly
the
dog
that
noble
collie
which
the
spoelmanns
had
brought
with
them
and
secondly
in
a
different
way
the
companion
countess
löwenjoul
as
for
the
dog
whose
name
was
percival
generally
shortened
to
percy
he
was
an
animal
of
so
excitable
and
emotional
a
disposition
as
beggared
description
inside
the
hotel
he
afforded
no
grounds
for
complaint
but
lay
in
a
dignified
attitude
on
a
small
carpet
outside
the
suite
but
every
time
he
went
out
he
had
an
attack
of
which
caused
general
interest
and
surprise
indeed
more
than
once
actual
obstruction
of
traffic
followed
at
a
distance
by
a
swarm
of
native
dogs
common
curs
which
incited
by
his
demeanour
assailed
him
with
censorious
yaps
and
which
caused
him
no
concern
whatever
he
flew
through
the
streets
his
nose
spattered
with
foam
and
barking
wildly
pirouetted
madly
in
front
of
the
tramcars
made
the
stumble
and
twice
knocked
widow
klaaszen
cake
stall
at
the
town
hall
down
so
violently
that
the
sugar
cakes
rolled
half
over
the
but
as
spoelmann
or
his
daughter
at
once
met
such
catastrophes
with
more
than
adequate
compensation
as
too
it
was
discovered
that
percival
attacks
were
really
quite
free
from
danger
that
he
was
anything
but
inclined
to
bite
and
steal
but
on
the
contrary
kept
to
himself
and
would
let
nobody
come
near
him
public
opinion
quickly
turned
in
his
favour
and
to
the
children
in
particular
his
excursions
were
a
constant
source
of
pleasure
countess
löwenjoul
on
her
side
supplied
food
for
conversation
in
a
quieter
but
no
less
strange
way
at
first
when
her
personality
and
position
were
not
yet
known
in
the
city
she
had
attracted
the
gibes
of
the
street
urchins
because
while
out
walking
alone
she
talked
to
herself
softly
and
deliberately
and
accompanied
her
words
with
lively
and
at
the
same
time
graceful
and
elegant
gestures
but
she
had
shown
such
mildness
and
goodness
to
the
children
who
shouted
after
her
and
tugged
at
her
dress
she
had
spoken
to
them
with
such
affection
and
dignity
that
her
persecutors
had
slunk
away
abashed
and
confused
and
later
when
she
became
known
respect
for
her
relations
with
the
famous
guests
secured
her
from
molestation
however
some
unintelligible
anecdotes
were
secretly
circulated
about
her
one
man
told
how
the
countess
had
given
him
a
gold
piece
with
instructions
that
he
should
box
the
ears
of
a
certain
old
woman
who
was
understood
to
have
made
some
unseemly
proposal
or
other
to
her
the
man
had
pocketed
the
gold
piece
without
however
discharging
his
commission
further
it
was
declared
as
a
fact
that
the
countess
had
accosted
the
sentry
in
front
of
the
fusiliers
barracks
and
had
told
him
at
once
to
arrest
the
wife
of
the
sergeant
of
one
of
the
companies
because
of
her
moral
shortcomings
she
had
written
too
a
letter
to
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
to
the
effect
that
all
sorts
of
secret
and
unspeakable
abominations
went
on
inside
the
barracks
whether
she
was
right
in
her
facts
heaven
only
knew
but
many
people
at
once
concluded
that
she
was
wrong
in
her
head
at
any
rate
there
was
no
time
to
investigate
the
matter
for
six
weeks
were
soon
past
and
samuel
spoelmann
the
millionaire
went
away
he
went
away
after
having
had
his
portrait
painted
by
professor
von
lindemann
an
expensive
portrait
too
which
he
gave
to
the
proprietor
of
the
spa
court
as
a
memento
he
went
away
with
his
daughter
the
countess
and
doctor
watercloose
with
percival
the
and
his
servants
went
by
special
train
to
the
south
with
the
view
of
spending
the
winter
on
the
riviera
whither
the
two
new
york
journalists
had
hastened
ahead
of
him
and
of
then
crossing
back
home
again
it
was
all
over
the
wished
spoelmann
a
hearty
farewell
and
expressed
the
hope
that
the
cure
would
be
found
to
have
done
him
good
and
with
that
the
notable
interlude
seemed
to
be
closed
and
done
with
everyday
life
claimed
its
due
and
spoelmann
began
to
fade
into
oblivion
the
winter
passed
it
was
the
winter
in
which
her
grand
ducal
highness
the
princess
zu
was
confined
of
a
daughter
spring
came
and
his
royal
highness
grand
duke
albrecht
repaired
as
usual
to
hollerbrunn
but
then
a
rumour
cropped
up
amongst
the
people
and
in
the
press
which
was
received
at
first
with
a
shrug
by
the
but
became
more
concrete
crystallized
took
to
itself
quite
precise
details
and
finally
won
itself
a
dominant
place
in
the
solid
and
pithy
news
of
the
day
what
was
toward
a
grand
ducal
schloss
was
about
to
be
sold
nonsense
which
schloss
delphinenort
schloss
delphinenort
in
the
north
park
twaddle
sold
to
whom
to
spoelmann
ridiculous
what
could
he
do
with
it
restore
it
and
live
in
it
that
all
very
well
but
perhaps
our
parliament
might
have
something
to
say
to
they
do
care
twopence
had
the
state
any
responsibility
for
keeping
up
schloss
delphinenort
if
they
had
it
a
pity
they
had
recognized
it
dear
old
place
no
parliament
had
no
say
in
the
matter
have
the
negotiations
advanced
at
all
far
rather
they
completed
goodness
gracious
then
of
course
the
exact
price
is
known
naturally
sold
for
two
millions
not
a
farthing
less
impossible
a
royal
palace
royal
palace
be
blowed
we
not
talking
of
the
grimmburg
or
of
the
old
schloss
we
talking
of
a
country
house
an
unused
country
house
which
is
falling
in
pieces
for
lack
of
funds
to
keep
it
up
so
spoelmann
intended
to
come
back
every
year
and
spend
several
weeks
in
delphinenort
no
for
he
intended
rather
to
come
and
settle
among
us
altogether
he
was
sick
of
america
wanted
to
turn
his
back
on
it
and
his
first
stay
amongst
us
was
merely
to
spy
out
the
land
he
was
ill
he
wanted
to
retire
from
business
he
had
always
remained
a
german
at
heart
the
father
had
emigrated
and
the
son
wanted
to
come
back
home
he
wished
to
take
his
part
in
the
modest
life
and
intellectual
resources
of
our
country
and
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
ditlinde
spa
all
was
confusion
and
bustle
and
discussions
without
end
but
public
opinion
with
the
exception
of
the
voices
of
a
few
grumblers
trended
after
a
short
hesitation
in
favour
of
the
idea
of
sale
indeed
without
this
general
approval
the
matter
could
never
have
gone
very
far
it
was
house
minister
von
knobelsdorff
who
first
ventured
on
a
cautious
announcement
of
spoelmann
offer
in
the
daily
press
he
had
waited
and
allowed
the
popular
feeling
to
come
to
a
decision
and
after
the
first
confusion
solid
reasons
in
favour
of
the
project
had
made
themselves
felt
the
business
world
was
enchanted
at
the
idea
of
having
so
doughty
a
consumer
at
its
doors
the
æsthetes
showed
themselves
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
schloss
delphinenort
restored
and
kept
up
at
seeing
the
noble
old
building
restored
to
honour
and
youth
in
so
unforeseen
indeed
so
romantic
a
way
but
the
brought
forward
figures
which
were
calculated
to
cause
grave
misgivings
as
to
the
financial
position
of
the
country
if
samuel
spoelmann
settled
among
us
he
would
become
a
he
would
have
to
pay
us
his
perhaps
it
was
worth
while
showing
what
that
meant
spoelmann
would
be
left
to
declare
his
own
income
but
from
what
one
knew
and
knew
fairly
accurately
his
residence
would
mean
a
yearly
revenue
of
two
and
a
half
millions
in
taxes
alone
not
to
mention
what
he
paid
in
rates
worth
thinking
about
was
it
the
question
was
put
straight
to
the
finance
minister
krippenreuther
he
would
be
wanting
in
his
duty
if
he
did
not
do
all
he
could
to
recommend
the
sale
in
the
highest
quarters
for
patriotism
demanded
that
spoelmann
offer
should
be
accepted
and
patriotism
was
paramount
above
all
other
considerations
so
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
had
had
an
interview
with
the
grand
duke
he
had
informed
his
master
of
the
public
opinion
had
added
that
the
price
offered
two
millions
considerably
exceeded
the
real
value
of
the
schloss
in
its
present
condition
had
remarked
that
such
a
sum
meant
a
real
windfall
for
the
treasury
and
had
ended
by
slipping
in
a
hint
about
the
central
heating
of
the
old
schloss
which
if
the
sale
was
carried
through
would
no
longer
be
an
impossibility
in
short
the
old
gentleman
had
brought
his
whole
influence
to
bear
in
favour
of
the
sale
and
had
recommended
the
grand
duke
to
bring
the
matter
before
a
family
moot
albrecht
had
sucked
his
lower
lip
softly
against
the
upper
and
summoned
the
family
moot
it
had
met
in
the
hall
of
the
knights
over
tea
and
biscuits
only
two
feminine
members
the
princess
catherine
and
ditlinde
had
opposed
the
sale
on
the
ground
of
loss
of
dignity
you
will
be
misunderstood
albrecht
said
ditlinde
they
will
charge
you
with
want
of
respect
to
your
high
station
and
that
is
not
right
for
you
have
on
the
contrary
too
much
you
are
so
proud
albrecht
that
everything
is
all
the
same
to
you
but
i
say
no
i
do
not
wish
to
see
a
croesus
living
in
one
of
your
schlosses
it
is
not
right
and
it
was
bad
enough
that
he
should
have
a
family
physician
and
take
the
prince
suite
in
the
spa
court
the
harps
on
the
fact
that
he
is
a
subject
but
in
my
eyes
he
is
simply
a
subject
and
nothing
else
what
do
you
think
klaus
heinrich
but
klaus
heinrich
voted
for
the
sale
in
the
first
place
albrecht
got
his
central
heating
secondly
spoelmann
was
not
one
of
the
common
herd
he
was
not
unschlitt
he
was
an
exception
and
there
was
no
disgrace
in
letting
him
have
delphinenort
finally
albrecht
had
with
downcast
eyes
pronounced
the
whole
family
moot
to
be
a
farce
the
people
had
long
ago
made
up
their
minds
his
ministers
urged
the
sale
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
wave
to
the
and
start
the
train
the
family
moot
had
taken
place
in
spring
from
that
time
onwards
the
negotiations
for
sale
which
were
carried
on
between
spoelmann
on
the
one
hand
and
the
lord
marshal
von
bühl
zu
bühl
on
the
other
had
proceeded
apace
and
the
summer
was
not
far
advanced
before
schloss
delphinenort
with
its
park
and
had
become
the
lawful
property
of
spoelmann
then
began
a
scene
of
bustle
and
confusion
round
and
in
the
schloss
which
daily
attracted
crowds
to
the
northern
side
of
the
park
delphinenort
was
improved
and
partly
reconstructed
inside
by
a
swarm
of
workmen
for
quick
quick
was
the
order
of
the
day
that
was
spoelmann
wish
and
he
had
only
allowed
five
months
respite
for
everything
to
be
ready
for
him
to
enter
into
possession
so
a
wooden
scaffold
with
ladders
and
platforms
shot
up
at
lightning
speed
round
the
dilapidated
old
building
foreign
workmen
swarmed
all
over
it
and
an
architect
came
with
carte
blanche
over
the
seas
to
superintend
the
work
but
the
greater
part
of
the
work
fell
to
our
native
manual
workers
to
perform
and
the
and
tilers
the
joiners
gilders
upholsterers
glaziers
and
of
the
city
the
landscape
gardeners
and
heating
and
lighting
experts
had
plenty
of
remunerative
work
all
through
the
summer
and
autumn
when
his
royal
highness
klaus
heinrich
left
his
window
in
the
hermitage
open
the
noise
of
the
work
at
delphinenort
penetrated
right
through
to
the
empire
room
and
he
often
drove
past
the
schloss
amid
the
respectful
greetings
of
the
public
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
progress
of
the
restoration
the
gardener
cottage
was
painted
up
the
sheds
and
stables
which
were
destined
to
accommodate
spoelmann
fleet
of
motors
and
carriages
were
enlarged
and
by
october
furniture
and
carpets
chests
and
cases
full
of
stuffs
and
household
utensils
had
been
delivered
at
schloss
delphinenort
while
it
was
whispered
among
the
bystanders
that
inside
the
walls
skilled
hands
were
at
work
fitting
spoelmann
costly
organ
which
had
been
sent
from
over
the
sea
with
electric
action
there
was
much
excitement
to
know
whether
the
park
belonging
to
the
schloss
which
had
been
so
splendidly
cleaned
up
and
trimmed
was
to
be
fenced
off
from
the
public
by
a
wall
or
hedge
but
nothing
of
the
sort
was
done
it
was
spoelmann
wish
that
the
property
should
continue
to
be
accessible
that
no
restraint
should
be
placed
on
the
enjoyment
of
the
park
the
sunday
promenaders
should
have
access
right
up
to
the
schloss
up
to
the
clipped
hedge
which
surrounded
the
big
square
pond
and
this
did
not
fail
to
make
an
excellent
impression
on
the
population
indeed
the
published
a
special
article
on
the
subject
in
which
it
praised
spoelmann
for
his
philanthropy
and
behold
when
the
leaves
again
began
to
fall
exactly
one
year
after
his
first
appearance
samuel
spoelmann
landed
a
second
time
at
our
railway
station
this
time
the
general
interest
in
the
event
was
much
greater
than
in
the
preceding
year
and
it
is
on
record
that
when
spoelmann
in
his
faded
coat
and
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
left
his
saloon
loud
cheers
were
raised
by
the
crowd
of
spectators
an
expression
of
feelings
which
spoelmann
seemed
rather
inclined
to
resent
and
which
not
he
but
doctor
watercloose
acknowledged
with
blinking
eyes
and
a
broad
smile
when
miss
spoelmann
too
alighted
a
cheer
was
raised
and
one
or
two
urchins
even
shouted
when
percy
the
collie
appeared
springing
leaping
and
altogether
beside
himself
on
the
platform
in
addition
to
the
doctor
and
countess
löwenjoul
there
were
two
unknown
persons
in
attendance
two
and
men
in
strangely
roomy
coats
they
were
secretaries
phlebs
and
slippers
as
the
announced
in
its
report
at
that
time
delphinenort
was
far
from
ready
and
the
spoelmanns
at
once
took
possession
of
the
first
floor
of
the
chief
hotel
where
a
big
haughty
man
in
black
the
steward
or
butler
of
the
spoelmann
establishment
who
had
preceded
them
had
made
preparations
for
them
and
put
the
together
with
his
own
hands
every
day
while
miss
imma
with
her
countess
and
percy
went
for
a
ride
or
a
visit
to
some
charitable
institution
spoelmann
hung
about
his
house
superintending
the
work
and
giving
orders
and
when
the
end
of
the
year
approached
just
after
the
first
snow
had
fallen
prospect
became
fact
and
the
spoelmanns
took
up
their
abode
in
schloss
delphinenort
two
motor
cars
their
arrival
had
been
watched
with
interest
splendid
cars
they
were
bore
the
six
members
of
the
party
phlebs
and
slippers
sat
in
the
hinder
one
driven
by
the
chauffeurs
with
servants
in
fur
coats
and
crossed
arms
beside
them
in
a
few
minutes
from
the
hotel
through
the
city
gardens
and
as
the
cars
dashed
along
the
noble
chestnut
avenue
which
led
to
the
drive
the
urchins
climbed
up
the
high
which
stood
at
all
four
corners
of
the
big
and
waved
their
caps
and
cheered
so
spoelmann
and
his
belongings
settled
down
among
us
and
we
basked
in
the
light
of
his
presence
his
livery
was
seen
and
known
in
the
city
just
as
the
grand
ducal
livery
was
seen
and
known
the
negro
in
scarlet
plush
who
was
doorkeeper
at
delphinenort
soon
became
a
popular
figure
and
when
heard
the
subdued
rumble
of
spoelmann
organ
from
the
interior
of
the
schloss
they
lifted
a
finger
and
said
hark
he
playing
that
means
that
he
not
got
colic
for
the
moment
miss
imma
was
to
be
seen
daily
by
the
side
of
countess
löwenjoul
followed
by
a
groom
and
with
percy
capering
round
riding
or
driving
a
smart
through
the
city
gardens
while
the
servant
who
sat
on
the
back
seat
stood
up
from
time
to
time
drew
a
long
silver
horn
from
a
leather
sheath
and
wound
a
shrill
warning
of
their
approach
and
by
getting
up
early
one
could
see
father
and
daughter
every
morning
go
in
a
brougham
or
in
fine
weather
on
foot
through
the
park
of
schloss
hermitage
to
the
in
order
to
drink
the
waters
imma
for
her
part
as
already
mentioned
again
began
a
course
of
visits
to
the
benevolent
institutions
of
the
city
though
she
appeared
not
to
give
up
her
studies
for
all
that
for
from
the
beginning
of
the
she
regularly
attended
the
lectures
of
the
councillor
klinghammer
at
the
university
sat
daily
in
a
black
dress
with
white
collar
and
cuffs
among
the
young
students
in
the
and
drove
her
with
her
raised
in
the
air
a
trick
of
hers
when
writing
over
the
pages
of
her
notebook
the
spoelmanns
lived
in
retirement
they
did
not
mix
in
the
life
of
the
town
as
was
natural
in
view
both
of
spoelmann
and
of
his
social
loneliness
what
social
group
could
he
have
attached
himself
to
nobody
even
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
consort
with
unschlitt
or
wolfsmilch
on
confidential
terms
yet
he
was
soon
approached
with
appeals
to
his
generosity
and
the
appeals
were
not
in
vain
for
spoelmann
who
it
was
well
known
before
his
departure
from
america
had
given
a
large
sum
in
dollars
to
the
board
of
education
in
the
united
states
and
had
also
stated
in
so
many
words
that
he
had
no
intention
of
withdrawing
his
yearly
contributions
to
the
spoelmann
university
and
his
other
educational
foundations
he
shortly
after
his
arrival
at
delphinenort
put
his
name
down
for
a
subscription
of
ten
thousand
marks
to
the
dorothea
children
hospital
for
which
a
collection
was
just
being
made
an
action
the
nobleness
of
which
was
immediately
recognized
in
fitting
terms
by
the
and
the
rest
of
the
press
in
fact
although
the
spoelmanns
lived
in
seclusion
in
a
social
sense
a
certain
amount
of
publicity
attached
to
their
life
among
us
from
the
earliest
moments
and
in
the
local
section
of
the
daily
newspapers
at
least
their
movements
were
followed
with
as
much
particularity
as
those
of
the
members
of
the
grand
ducal
house
the
public
were
informed
when
miss
imma
had
played
a
game
of
lawn
tennis
with
the
countess
and
phlebs
and
slippers
in
the
delphinenort
park
it
was
noted
when
she
had
been
at
the
court
theatre
and
whether
her
father
had
gone
with
her
for
an
act
or
two
of
the
opera
and
if
spoelmann
shrank
from
curiosity
never
leaving
his
box
during
the
intervals
and
scarcely
ever
showing
himself
on
foot
in
the
streets
yet
he
was
obviously
not
insensible
to
the
duties
of
a
spectacular
kind
which
were
inherent
in
an
extraordinary
existence
like
his
own
and
he
gave
the
love
of
gazing
its
due
it
has
been
said
that
the
delphinenort
park
was
not
divided
from
the
town
gardens
no
walls
separated
the
schloss
from
the
outer
world
from
the
back
one
could
walk
over
the
turf
right
up
to
the
foot
of
the
broad
covered
terrace
which
had
been
built
on
that
side
and
if
bold
enough
look
through
the
big
glass
door
straight
into
the
high
in
which
spoelmann
and
his
family
had
tea
indeed
when
summer
came
tea
was
laid
on
the
terrace
outside
and
and
miss
spoelmann
the
countess
and
doctor
watercloose
sat
in
basket
chairs
of
a
shape
and
took
their
tea
as
if
on
a
public
platform
for
on
sunday
at
any
rate
there
was
never
wanting
a
public
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
at
a
respectful
distance
they
called
each
attention
to
the
silver
which
was
heated
by
electricity
a
quite
novel
idea
and
to
the
wonderful
liveries
of
the
two
footmen
who
handed
the
tea
and
cakes
white
coats
with
on
the
collars
cuffs
and
seams
they
listened
to
the
conversation
and
followed
with
open
mouths
every
movement
of
the
notable
family
on
the
terrace
they
then
went
round
past
the
front
door
in
order
to
shout
a
few
witticisms
in
the
local
dialect
to
the
negro
which
he
answered
with
a
dental
grin
klaus
heinrich
saw
imma
spoelmann
for
the
first
time
on
a
bright
winter
day
at
noon
that
does
not
mean
that
he
had
not
already
caught
sight
of
her
often
at
the
theatre
in
the
street
and
in
the
town
park
but
that
quite
a
different
thing
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
at
this
midday
hour
in
exciting
circumstances
he
had
been
giving
free
audiences
in
the
old
schloss
till
eleven
and
after
they
were
finished
had
not
returned
at
once
to
schloss
hermitage
but
had
ordered
his
coachman
to
keep
the
carriage
waiting
in
one
of
the
courts
as
he
wished
to
smoke
a
cigarette
with
the
guards
officers
on
duty
as
he
wore
the
uniform
of
that
regiment
to
which
his
personal
also
belonged
he
made
an
effort
to
maintain
the
semblance
of
some
sort
of
camaraderie
with
the
officers
he
dined
from
time
to
time
in
their
mess
and
occasionally
gave
them
half
an
hour
of
his
company
on
guard
although
he
had
a
dim
suspicion
that
he
was
rather
a
nuisance
as
he
kept
them
from
their
cards
and
stories
so
there
he
stood
the
convex
silver
star
of
the
noble
order
of
the
grimmburg
griffin
on
his
breast
his
left
hand
planted
well
back
on
his
hip
with
herr
von
who
had
given
due
notice
of
the
visit
in
the
officers
mess
which
was
situated
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
schloss
near
the
albrechts
gate
engaged
in
a
trivial
conversation
with
two
or
three
officers
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
a
further
group
of
officers
chatted
at
the
window
owing
to
the
warmth
of
sun
outside
the
window
stood
open
and
from
the
barracks
along
the
albrechtstrasse
came
the
strains
of
the
drum
and
fife
band
of
the
approaching
relief
guard
twelve
struck
from
the
court
chapel
tower
the
loud
fall
in
of
the
officer
was
heard
outside
and
the
rattle
of
grenadiers
standing
to
arms
the
public
collected
on
the
square
the
lieutenant
on
duty
hastily
buckled
on
his
sword
belt
clapped
his
heels
together
in
a
salute
to
klaus
heinrich
and
went
out
then
suddenly
lieutenant
von
sturmhahn
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
cried
with
that
rather
poor
imitation
of
familiarity
which
was
proper
to
the
relations
between
klaus
heinrich
and
the
officers
great
heavens
here
something
for
you
to
look
at
royal
highness
there
goes
miss
spoelmann
with
her
algebra
under
her
arm
klaus
heinrich
walked
to
the
window
miss
imma
was
walking
by
herself
along
the
pavement
with
both
hands
thrust
into
her
big
flat
muff
which
was
trimmed
with
pendent
tails
she
carried
her
notebook
pressed
to
her
side
with
her
elbow
she
was
wearing
a
long
coat
of
shiny
black
fox
and
a
toque
of
the
same
fur
on
her
dark
hair
she
was
obviously
coming
from
delphinenort
and
hurrying
towards
the
university
she
reached
the
main
at
the
moment
at
which
the
relief
guard
marched
up
the
gutter
over
against
the
guard
on
duty
which
standing
at
attention
in
two
ranks
occupied
the
pavement
she
was
absolutely
compelled
to
go
round
outside
the
band
and
the
crowd
of
spectators
indeed
if
she
wished
to
avoid
the
open
square
with
its
to
make
a
fairly
wide
detour
on
the
footpath
running
round
it
or
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
military
ceremony
she
showed
no
intention
of
doing
either
she
made
as
if
to
walk
along
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
schloss
right
down
between
the
two
ranks
of
soldiers
the
sergeant
with
the
harsh
voice
stepped
forward
quickly
not
this
way
he
cried
and
held
the
butt
of
his
rifle
in
front
of
her
not
this
way
right
about
wait
but
miss
spoelmann
fired
up
what
mean
she
cried
i
in
a
hurry
but
her
words
were
not
so
impressive
as
the
expression
of
honest
passionate
irresistible
anger
with
which
they
were
uttered
how
slight
and
lonely
she
was
the
soldiers
round
her
towered
head
and
shoulders
above
her
her
face
was
as
pale
as
wax
at
this
moment
her
black
eyebrows
were
knitted
in
a
hard
and
expressive
wrinkle
her
nostrils
distended
and
her
eyes
black
with
excitement
and
spoke
so
expressive
and
bewitching
a
language
that
no
protest
seemed
possible
what
mean
she
cried
i
in
a
hurry
and
as
she
said
it
she
pushed
the
and
the
stupefied
sergeant
with
it
aside
and
walked
down
between
the
lines
went
straight
on
her
way
turned
to
the
left
into
universitätsstrasse
and
vanished
i
dammed
cried
lieutenant
von
sturmhahn
that
one
for
us
the
officers
at
the
window
laughed
the
spectators
outside
too
were
much
amused
and
not
unsympathetic
klaus
heinrich
joined
in
the
general
hilarity
the
changing
of
the
guard
proceeded
with
loud
words
of
command
and
snatches
of
march
tunes
klaus
heinrich
returned
to
the
hermitage
he
lunched
all
alone
went
for
a
ride
in
the
afternoon
on
his
brown
horse
florian
and
spent
the
evening
at
a
big
party
at
krippenreuther
the
finance
minister
house
he
related
to
several
people
with
great
animation
the
episode
of
the
guard
although
the
story
had
already
gone
the
round
and
become
common
property
next
day
he
had
to
go
away
for
he
had
been
told
by
his
brother
to
represent
him
at
the
inauguration
of
the
new
town
hall
in
a
neighbouring
town
for
some
reason
or
other
he
went
reluctantly
he
disliked
leaving
the
capital
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
missing
an
important
pleasant
though
rather
disquieting
opportunity
which
imperatively
demanded
his
presence
and
yet
his
exalted
calling
must
be
more
important
but
while
he
sat
serene
and
gorgeously
dressed
on
his
seat
of
honour
in
the
town
hall
and
read
his
speech
to
the
mayor
klaus
heinrich
thoughts
were
not
concentrated
on
the
figure
he
presented
to
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
but
rather
were
busied
with
this
new
and
important
topic
he
also
gave
a
passing
thought
to
a
person
whose
casual
acquaintance
he
had
made
long
years
before
to
fräulein
unschlitt
the
daughter
a
memory
which
had
a
certain
connexion
with
the
importunate
topic
imma
spoelmann
pushed
the
sergeant
aside
in
her
anger
walked
all
alone
her
algebra
under
her
arm
down
the
ranks
of
the
big
grenadiers
how
her
face
was
against
her
black
hair
under
her
fur
toque
and
how
her
eyes
spoke
there
was
nobody
like
her
her
father
was
rich
surfeited
with
riches
and
had
bought
one
of
the
grand
ducal
schlosses
what
was
it
that
the
had
said
about
his
undeserved
reputation
and
the
romantic
isolation
of
his
life
he
was
the
object
of
the
hatred
of
aggrieved
rivals
that
was
the
effect
of
the
article
and
her
nostrils
had
distended
with
anger
there
was
nobody
like
her
nobody
near
or
far
she
was
an
exception
and
suppose
she
had
been
at
the
citizens
ball
on
that
occasion
he
would
then
have
had
a
companion
would
not
have
made
a
fool
of
himself
and
would
not
have
ended
the
evening
in
despair
down
down
down
with
him
phew
just
think
of
how
she
looked
as
she
walked
dark
and
pale
and
wonderful
down
the
ranks
of
soldiers
these
were
the
thoughts
which
occupied
klaus
heinrich
during
the
next
few
days
just
these
three
or
four
mental
pictures
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
they
were
amply
sufficient
for
him
and
that
he
did
not
want
any
more
but
all
things
considered
it
seemed
to
him
more
than
desirable
that
he
should
get
another
glimpse
of
the
face
soon
if
possible
in
the
evening
he
went
to
the
court
theatre
where
magic
was
being
played
and
when
from
his
box
he
descried
miss
spoelmann
next
to
countess
löwenjoul
in
the
front
of
the
circle
a
tremor
went
right
through
him
during
the
opera
he
could
watch
her
out
of
the
darkness
through
his
for
the
light
from
the
stage
fell
on
her
she
laid
her
head
on
her
small
ringless
hand
while
she
rested
her
bare
arm
on
the
velvet
braid
and
she
did
not
look
angry
now
she
wore
a
dress
of
glistening
silk
with
a
light
scarf
on
which
bright
flowers
were
embroidered
and
round
her
neck
a
long
chain
of
sparkling
diamonds
she
really
was
not
so
small
as
she
looked
klaus
heinrich
decided
when
she
stood
up
at
the
end
of
the
act
no
the
childish
shape
of
her
head
and
the
narrowness
of
her
shoulders
accounted
for
her
looking
such
a
little
thing
her
arms
were
well
developed
and
one
could
see
that
she
played
games
and
rode
but
at
the
wrist
her
arm
looked
like
a
child
when
the
passage
came
he
is
a
prince
he
is
more
than
that
klaus
heinrich
conceived
the
wish
to
have
a
talk
with
doctor
ueberbein
doctor
ueberbein
called
by
chance
next
day
at
the
hermitage
in
a
black
and
white
tie
as
usual
when
he
paid
klaus
heinrich
a
visit
klaus
heinrich
asked
him
whether
he
had
already
heard
the
story
of
the
changing
of
the
guard
yes
answered
doctor
ueberbein
several
times
but
would
klaus
heinrich
like
to
relate
it
to
him
again
no
not
if
you
know
it
said
klaus
heinrich
disappointed
then
doctor
ueberbein
jumped
to
quite
another
topic
he
began
to
talk
about
and
remarked
that
were
a
wonderful
invention
they
brought
close
what
was
unfortunately
a
long
way
off
did
they
not
they
formed
a
bridge
to
a
goal
what
did
klaus
heinrich
think
klaus
heinrich
was
inclined
to
agree
to
a
certain
extent
and
it
seemed
that
yesterday
evening
so
people
said
he
had
made
a
free
use
of
this
grand
invention
said
the
doctor
klaus
heinrich
could
not
see
the
point
of
this
remark
then
doctor
ueberbein
said
no
look
here
klaus
heinrich
that
do
you
are
stared
at
and
little
imma
is
stared
at
and
that
enough
if
you
add
to
it
by
staring
at
little
imma
that
too
much
you
must
see
that
surely
oh
dear
doctor
ueberbein
i
never
thought
of
that
but
in
other
cases
you
generally
do
think
of
that
sort
of
thing
i
felt
so
funny
for
the
last
few
days
said
klaus
heinrich
doctor
ueberbein
leaned
back
pulled
at
his
red
beard
near
his
throat
and
nodded
slowly
with
his
head
and
neck
really
have
you
he
asked
and
then
went
on
nodding
klaus
heinrich
said
you
ca
think
how
reluctant
i
was
to
go
the
other
day
to
the
inauguration
of
the
town
hall
and
i
have
to
superintend
the
of
the
grenadier
recruits
and
then
comes
the
chapter
of
the
family
order
i
do
feel
a
bit
in
the
mood
for
that
i
find
no
pleasure
in
doing
my
duty
as
the
representative
of
my
people
i
no
inclination
for
my
lofty
calling
i
sorry
to
hear
it
said
doctor
ueberbein
sharply
yes
i
might
have
known
that
you
would
be
angry
doctor
ueberbein
of
course
you
call
it
sloppiness
and
will
read
me
a
sermon
about
and
discipline
if
i
know
you
but
at
the
opera
yesterday
i
thought
of
you
at
one
point
and
asked
myself
whether
you
really
were
so
right
in
several
particulars
look
here
klaus
heinrich
once
already
if
i
not
mistaken
dragged
your
royal
highness
out
of
the
mud
so
to
speak
that
was
quite
different
doctor
ueberbein
how
i
wish
you
could
see
that
was
absolutely
different
that
was
at
the
citizens
ball
but
it
was
years
ago
and
i
do
feel
a
twinge
in
that
direction
for
she
is
look
you
you
have
often
explained
to
me
what
you
understand
by
and
that
it
is
something
affecting
and
something
to
be
approached
with
tender
sympathy
do
you
think
that
she
of
whom
we
are
speaking
that
she
is
affecting
and
that
one
must
feel
sympathy
with
her
perhaps
said
doctor
ueberbein
perhaps
you
often
said
that
one
must
not
disavow
exceptions
that
to
do
so
was
sloppiness
and
slovenly
and
do
you
think
that
she
too
of
whom
we
are
speaking
is
an
exception
doctor
ueberbein
was
silent
then
he
said
suddenly
and
decidedly
and
now
i
if
possible
am
to
help
to
make
two
exceptions
into
a
rule
thereupon
he
went
out
he
said
that
he
must
get
back
to
his
work
emphasizing
the
word
work
and
begged
leave
to
withdraw
he
took
his
departure
in
a
strangely
ceremonious
and
unfatherly
way
klaus
heinrich
did
not
see
him
for
ten
or
twelve
days
he
asked
him
to
lunch
once
but
doctor
ueberbein
begged
to
be
excused
his
work
at
the
moment
was
too
pressing
at
last
he
came
spontaneously
he
was
in
high
spirits
and
looked
greener
than
ever
he
blustered
about
this
and
that
and
at
last
came
to
the
subject
of
the
spoelmanns
looking
at
the
ceiling
and
pulling
at
his
throat
when
he
did
so
to
be
quite
fair
he
said
there
was
a
striking
amount
of
sympathy
felt
with
samuel
spoelmann
one
could
see
all
over
the
town
how
much
beloved
he
was
chiefly
of
course
as
an
object
of
taxation
but
in
other
respects
too
there
was
simply
a
penchant
for
him
in
every
class
for
his
and
his
faded
coat
and
his
every
errand
boy
was
proud
of
him
and
if
he
were
not
so
unapproachable
and
morose
he
would
already
have
been
made
to
feel
it
the
marks
donation
for
the
dorothea
hospital
had
naturally
made
an
excellent
impression
his
friend
sammet
had
told
him
ueberbein
that
with
the
help
of
this
donation
improvements
had
been
undertaken
in
the
hospital
and
for
the
rest
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
little
imma
was
going
to
inspect
the
improvements
morning
sammet
had
told
him
she
had
sent
one
of
her
flunkeys
and
asked
whether
she
would
be
welcome
she
and
sick
children
were
a
devilish
funny
mixture
opined
ueberbein
but
perhaps
she
might
learn
something
morning
at
eleven
if
his
memory
did
not
mislead
him
then
he
talked
about
other
things
on
leaving
he
added
the
grand
duke
ought
to
take
some
interest
in
the
dorothea
hospital
klaus
heinrich
it
expected
of
him
it
a
blessed
institution
in
short
somebody
ought
to
show
the
way
give
signs
of
an
interest
in
high
quarters
no
wish
to
intrude
and
so
but
he
came
back
once
more
and
in
his
green
face
a
flush
had
appeared
under
the
eyes
which
looked
entirely
out
of
place
there
if
he
said
deliberately
i
ever
caught
you
again
with
a
soup
tureen
on
your
head
klaus
heinrich
i
should
leave
it
there
then
he
pressed
his
lips
together
and
went
out
next
morning
shortly
before
eleven
klaus
heinrich
walked
with
herr
von
his
from
schloss
hermitage
through
the
birch
avenue
over
rough
suburban
streets
between
humble
cottages
and
stopped
before
the
neat
white
house
over
whose
entrance
dorothea
children
hospital
was
painted
in
broad
black
letters
his
visit
had
been
announced
the
senior
surgeon
of
the
institution
in
a
with
the
albrechts
cross
of
the
third
class
was
awaiting
him
with
two
younger
surgeons
and
the
nursing
staff
in
the
hall
the
prince
and
his
companion
were
wearing
helmets
and
fur
coats
klaus
heinrich
said
this
is
the
renewal
of
an
old
acquaintance
my
dear
doctor
you
were
present
when
i
came
into
the
world
you
are
also
a
friend
of
my
tutor
ueberbein
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
doctor
sammet
who
had
grown
grey
in
his
life
of
active
philanthropy
bowed
to
one
side
with
one
hand
on
his
and
his
elbows
close
to
his
ribs
he
presented
the
two
junior
surgeons
and
the
sister
to
the
prince
and
then
said
i
must
explain
to
your
royal
highness
that
your
royal
highness
gracious
visit
coincides
with
another
visit
yes
we
are
expecting
miss
spoelmann
her
father
has
done
such
a
lot
for
our
institution
we
could
not
very
well
upset
the
arrangements
the
sister
will
take
miss
spoelmann
round
klaus
heinrich
received
the
news
of
this
rencontre
without
displeasure
he
first
expressed
his
opinion
of
the
nurses
uniform
which
he
called
becoming
and
then
his
curiosity
to
inspect
the
philanthropic
institution
the
tour
began
the
sister
and
three
nurses
waited
behind
in
the
hall
all
the
walls
in
the
building
were
whitewashed
and
washable
yes
the
water
taps
were
huge
they
were
meant
to
be
worked
with
the
elbows
for
reasons
of
cleanliness
and
rinsing
apparatus
had
been
installed
for
washing
the
one
passed
first
through
the
reception
room
which
was
empty
save
for
a
couple
of
disused
beds
and
the
bicycles
in
the
adjoining
preparation
room
there
were
besides
the
and
the
stand
with
the
students
white
coats
a
kind
of
folding
table
with
cushions
an
a
cupboard
of
provisions
and
a
perambulator
klaus
heinrich
paused
at
the
provisions
and
asked
for
the
recipes
for
the
preparations
to
be
explained
to
him
doctor
sammet
thought
to
himself
that
if
the
whole
tour
was
going
to
be
made
with
such
attention
to
details
a
terrible
lot
of
time
would
be
wasted
suddenly
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
street
an
automobile
drove
up
tooting
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
building
cheers
were
heard
distinctly
in
the
preparation
room
for
all
that
it
was
only
children
that
were
shouting
klaus
heinrich
did
not
pay
any
particular
attention
to
the
incident
he
was
looking
at
a
box
of
sugar
of
milk
which
by
the
way
had
nothing
striking
about
it
a
visitor
apparently
he
said
oh
of
course
you
said
somebody
was
coming
let
go
on
the
party
proceeded
to
the
kitchen
the
the
big
room
for
the
preparing
of
milk
the
place
where
full
milk
boiled
milk
and
buttermilk
were
kept
the
daily
rations
were
set
on
clean
white
tables
in
little
bottles
side
by
side
the
place
smelt
sourish
and
sickly
klaus
heinrich
gave
his
undivided
attention
to
this
room
also
he
went
so
far
as
to
taste
the
buttermilk
and
pronounced
it
excellent
how
the
children
must
thrive
he
considered
on
buttermilk
like
that
during
this
inspection
the
door
opened
and
miss
spoelmann
entered
between
the
sister
and
countess
löwenjoul
followed
by
the
three
nurses
the
coat
toque
and
muff
which
she
was
wearing
were
made
of
the
costliest
sable
and
her
muff
was
suspended
on
a
golden
chain
set
with
coloured
stones
her
black
hair
showed
a
tendency
to
fall
in
smooth
locks
over
her
forehead
she
took
in
the
room
at
a
glance
her
eyes
were
really
almost
unbecomingly
big
for
her
little
face
they
dominated
it
like
a
cat
save
that
they
were
black
as
anthracite
and
spoke
a
pleading
language
of
their
own
countess
löwenjoul
with
a
feather
hat
and
dressed
neatly
and
not
without
distinction
as
usual
smiled
in
a
detached
sort
of
way
the
said
the
sister
this
is
where
the
milk
is
cooked
for
the
children
so
one
would
have
supposed
answered
miss
spoelmann
she
said
it
quickly
and
lightly
with
a
pout
of
her
lips
and
a
little
haughty
wag
of
her
head
her
voice
was
a
double
one
it
consisted
of
a
lower
and
a
higher
register
with
a
break
in
the
middle
the
sister
was
quite
disconcerted
yes
she
said
it
obvious
and
a
little
pained
look
of
bewilderment
was
visible
in
her
face
the
position
was
a
complicated
one
doctor
sammet
looked
in
klaus
heinrich
face
for
orders
but
as
klaus
heinrich
was
accustomed
to
do
what
was
put
before
him
according
to
prescribed
forms
but
not
to
grapple
with
novel
and
complex
situations
no
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
forthcoming
herr
von
braunbart
was
on
the
point
of
intervening
and
miss
spoelmann
on
the
other
side
was
making
ready
to
leave
the
when
the
prince
made
a
gesture
with
his
right
hand
which
established
a
connexion
between
himself
and
the
young
girl
this
was
the
signal
for
doctor
sammet
to
advance
towards
imma
spoelmann
doctor
sammet
yes
he
desired
the
honour
of
presenting
miss
spoelmann
to
his
royal
highness
miss
spoelmann
royal
highness
the
daughter
of
spoelmann
to
whom
this
hospital
is
so
much
indebted
klaus
heinrich
clapped
his
heels
together
and
held
out
his
hand
in
its
white
gauntlet
and
laying
her
small
hand
in
it
she
gave
him
a
horizontal
english
fashion
at
the
same
time
making
a
sort
of
shy
curtsey
without
taking
her
big
eyes
off
klaus
face
he
could
think
of
nothing
more
original
to
say
than
so
you
too
are
paying
a
visit
to
the
hospital
miss
spoelmann
and
she
answered
as
quickly
as
before
with
a
pout
and
the
little
haughty
wag
of
her
head
nobody
can
deny
that
everything
points
in
that
direction
herr
braunbart
involuntarily
raised
his
hand
doctor
sammet
looked
down
at
his
in
silence
and
a
short
snigger
escaped
through
the
nose
of
one
of
the
young
surgeons
which
was
hardly
opportune
the
little
pained
look
of
bewilderment
now
showed
on
klaus
heinrich
face
he
said
of
course
as
you
are
here
so
i
shall
be
able
to
visit
the
institution
in
your
company
miss
spoelmann
captain
von
braunbart
my
he
added
quickly
recognizing
that
his
remark
laid
him
open
to
a
similar
answer
to
the
last
she
responded
by
countess
löwenjoul
the
countess
made
a
dignified
bow
with
an
enigmatic
smile
a
side
glance
into
the
unknown
which
had
something
seductive
about
it
when
however
she
let
her
strangely
evasive
gaze
again
dwell
on
klaus
heinrich
who
stood
before
her
in
a
composed
and
military
attitude
the
laugh
vanished
from
her
face
an
expression
of
sadness
settled
on
her
features
and
for
a
second
a
look
of
something
like
hatred
for
klaus
heinrich
shone
in
her
slightly
swollen
grey
eyes
it
was
only
a
passing
look
klaus
heinrich
had
no
time
to
notice
it
and
forgot
it
immediately
the
two
young
surgeons
were
presented
to
imma
spoelmann
and
then
klaus
heinrich
suggested
that
they
should
continue
the
tour
all
together
they
went
upstairs
to
the
first
story
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
spoelmann
in
front
conducted
by
doctor
sammet
then
countess
löwenjoul
with
herr
von
braunbart
and
the
young
surgeons
in
the
rear
yes
the
older
children
were
here
up
to
fourteen
years
of
age
an
with
divided
the
girls
and
the
boys
rooms
in
white
bedsteads
with
a
at
the
head
and
a
frame
at
the
foot
enclosing
the
and
tended
by
nurses
in
white
caps
and
surrounded
by
cleanliness
and
tidiness
lay
the
sick
children
and
coughs
filled
the
room
while
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
spoelmann
walked
down
between
the
rows
he
walked
at
her
left
hand
out
of
courtesy
with
the
same
smile
as
when
he
visited
exhibitions
or
inspected
veterans
gymnastic
associations
or
guards
of
honour
but
every
time
he
turned
his
head
to
the
right
he
found
that
imma
spoelmann
was
watching
him
he
met
her
great
black
eyes
which
were
directed
at
him
in
a
searching
questioning
way
it
was
so
peculiar
he
never
remembered
experiencing
anything
so
peculiar
before
her
way
of
looking
at
him
with
her
great
eyes
without
any
respect
for
him
or
anyone
else
absolutely
unembarrassed
and
free
quite
unconcerned
whether
anybody
noticed
it
or
not
when
doctor
sammet
stopped
at
a
bed
to
describe
the
case
the
little
girl
for
instance
whose
broken
leg
stuck
straight
out
along
the
bed
miss
spoelmann
listened
attentively
to
him
that
was
quite
clear
but
while
she
listened
she
did
not
look
at
the
speaker
but
her
eyes
rested
in
turn
on
klaus
heinrich
and
the
pinched
quiet
child
who
her
hands
folded
on
her
breast
gazed
up
at
them
from
her
rested
in
turn
on
the
prince
and
the
little
victim
the
history
of
whose
case
she
shared
with
the
prince
as
if
she
were
watching
klaus
heinrich
sympathy
or
were
trying
to
read
in
his
face
the
effect
of
sammet
words
or
maybe
for
some
other
reason
yes
this
was
especially
noticeable
in
the
case
of
the
boy
with
the
bullet
through
his
arm
and
the
boy
who
had
been
picked
out
of
the
water
two
sad
cases
as
sammet
remarked
a
severed
artery
sister
he
said
and
showed
them
the
double
wound
in
the
boy
upper
arm
the
entry
and
exit
of
the
revolver
bullet
the
wound
said
doctor
sammet
in
an
undertone
to
his
guests
turning
his
back
to
the
bed
the
wound
was
caused
by
his
own
father
this
one
was
the
lucky
one
the
man
shot
his
wife
three
of
his
children
and
himself
with
a
revolver
he
made
a
bad
shot
at
this
boy
klaus
heinrich
looked
at
the
double
wound
what
did
the
man
do
it
for
he
asked
hesitatingly
and
doctor
sammet
answered
in
desperation
royal
highness
it
was
shame
and
want
which
brought
him
to
it
yes
he
said
no
more
just
this
commonplace
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
boy
a
who
had
been
picked
out
of
the
water
he
wheezing
said
doctor
sammet
he
still
got
some
water
in
his
lung
he
was
picked
out
of
the
river
early
this
morning
yes
i
may
say
that
it
is
improbable
that
he
into
the
water
there
are
many
indications
to
the
contrary
he
had
run
away
from
home
yes
he
stopped
and
klaus
heinrich
again
felt
miss
spoelmann
looking
at
him
with
her
big
black
serious
eyes
with
her
glance
which
sought
his
own
and
seemed
to
challenge
him
insistently
to
ponder
with
her
the
sad
cases
to
grasp
the
essential
meaning
of
doctor
sammet
remarks
to
penetrate
to
the
hideous
truths
which
were
incorporated
and
crystallized
in
these
two
little
invalid
frames
a
little
girl
wept
bitterly
when
the
steaming
and
hissing
inhaler
together
with
a
scrapbook
full
of
brightly
coloured
pictures
was
planted
at
her
bedside
miss
spoelmann
bent
over
the
little
one
it
does
hurt
she
said
not
a
tiny
bit
do
cry
and
as
she
straightened
herself
again
she
added
quickly
pursing
up
her
lips
i
guess
it
not
so
much
the
apparatus
as
the
pictures
she
crying
at
everybody
laughed
one
of
the
young
assistants
picked
up
the
scrapbook
and
laughed
still
louder
when
he
looked
at
the
pictures
the
party
passed
on
into
the
laboratory
klaus
heinrich
thought
as
he
went
how
dry
miss
spoelmann
humour
was
i
guess
she
had
said
and
not
so
much
she
had
seemed
to
find
amusement
not
only
in
the
pictures
but
also
in
the
neat
and
incisive
mode
of
expression
she
had
used
and
that
was
indeed
the
very
refinement
of
humour
the
laboratory
was
the
biggest
room
in
the
building
glasses
retorts
funnels
and
chemicals
stood
on
the
tables
as
well
as
specimens
in
spirits
which
doctor
sammet
explained
to
his
guests
in
few
quiet
words
a
child
had
choked
in
a
mysterious
way
here
was
his
larynx
with
growths
instead
of
the
vocal
chords
yes
this
here
in
the
glass
was
a
case
of
pernicious
enlargement
of
the
kidney
in
a
child
and
there
were
dislocated
joints
klaus
heinrich
and
miss
spoelmann
looked
at
everything
they
looked
together
into
the
bottles
which
doctor
sammet
held
up
to
the
window
and
their
eyes
looked
thoughtful
while
the
same
look
of
repulsion
hovered
round
their
mouths
they
took
turns
too
at
the
microscope
examined
with
one
eye
placed
to
the
lens
a
malignant
secretion
a
piece
of
tissue
stuck
on
a
slide
with
tiny
spots
showing
near
the
big
patch
the
spots
were
bacilli
klaus
heinrich
wanted
miss
spoelmann
to
take
the
first
turn
at
the
microscope
but
she
declined
knitting
her
brows
and
pouting
as
much
as
to
say
on
no
account
whatever
so
he
took
the
precedence
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
really
did
not
matter
who
got
the
first
look
at
such
serious
and
fearful
things
as
bacilli
and
after
this
they
were
conducted
up
to
the
second
story
to
the
infants
they
both
laughed
at
the
chorus
of
squalls
which
reached
their
ears
while
they
were
still
on
the
stairs
and
then
they
went
with
their
party
through
the
ward
between
the
beds
bent
side
by
side
over
the
little
creatures
sleeping
with
closed
fists
or
screaming
with
all
their
might
and
showing
their
naked
gums
they
stopped
their
ears
and
laughed
again
in
a
kind
of
oven
warmed
to
a
moderate
heat
lay
a
baby
and
doctor
sammet
showed
his
distinguished
guests
a
pauper
baby
with
the
grey
look
of
a
corpse
and
hideous
big
hands
the
sign
of
a
miscarriage
he
lifted
a
squealing
baby
out
of
its
cot
and
it
at
once
stopped
screaming
with
the
touch
of
an
expert
he
rested
the
limp
head
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
showed
the
little
red
creature
blinking
and
twitching
spasmodically
to
the
two
klaus
heinrich
and
miss
spoelmann
who
stood
side
by
side
and
looked
down
at
the
infant
klaus
heinrich
stood
watching
with
his
heels
together
as
doctor
sammet
laid
the
baby
back
in
its
cot
and
when
he
turned
round
he
met
miss
spoelmann
searching
gaze
as
he
had
expected
finally
they
walked
to
one
of
the
three
windows
of
the
ward
and
looked
out
over
the
squalid
suburb
down
into
the
street
where
surrounded
by
children
the
brown
court
carriage
and
imma
smart
motor
car
stood
one
behind
the
other
the
spoelmanns
chauffeur
shapeless
in
his
fur
coat
was
leaning
back
in
his
seat
with
one
hand
on
the
of
the
powerful
car
and
watched
his
companion
the
footman
in
white
trying
to
start
a
conversation
by
the
carriage
in
front
with
klaus
heinrich
coachman
our
neighbours
said
doctor
sammet
holding
back
the
white
net
curtain
with
one
hand
are
the
parents
of
our
patients
late
in
the
evening
the
tipsy
fathers
roll
shouting
by
yes
they
stood
and
listened
but
doctor
sammet
said
nothing
further
about
the
fathers
and
so
they
broke
off
as
they
had
now
seen
everything
the
procession
with
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
at
the
head
proceeded
down
the
staircase
and
found
the
nurses
again
assembled
in
the
front
hall
leave
was
taken
with
compliments
and
clapping
together
of
heels
curtseys
and
bows
klaus
heinrich
standing
stiffly
in
front
of
doctor
sammet
who
listened
to
him
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
hand
on
his
expressed
himself
in
his
wonted
form
of
words
highly
satisfied
with
what
he
had
seen
while
he
felt
that
imma
great
eyes
were
resting
upon
him
he
with
herr
von
braunbart
accompanied
miss
spoelmann
to
her
car
when
the
from
the
surgeons
and
nurses
was
over
klaus
heinrich
and
miss
spoelmann
while
they
crossed
the
pavement
between
children
and
women
with
children
in
their
arms
and
for
a
short
time
by
the
broad
step
of
the
motor
car
exchanged
the
following
remarks
it
has
been
a
great
pleasure
to
meet
you
he
said
she
answered
nothing
to
this
but
pouted
and
wagged
her
head
a
little
from
side
to
side
it
was
an
absorbing
inspection
he
went
on
a
regular
she
looked
at
him
with
her
big
black
eyes
then
said
quickly
and
lightly
in
her
broken
voice
yes
to
a
certain
extent
he
ventured
on
the
question
i
hope
you
are
pleased
with
schloss
delphinenort
to
which
she
answered
with
a
pout
oh
why
not
it
quite
a
convenient
house
do
you
like
being
there
better
than
at
new
york
he
asked
and
she
answered
just
as
much
it
much
the
same
much
the
same
everywhere
that
was
all
klaus
heinrich
and
one
pace
behind
him
herr
von
braunbart
stood
with
their
hands
to
their
helmets
as
the
chauffeur
slipped
his
gear
in
and
the
motor
car
shivered
and
started
it
may
be
imagined
that
this
meeting
did
not
long
remain
the
private
property
of
the
dorothea
hospital
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
general
topic
of
conversation
before
the
day
was
out
the
published
under
a
sentimental
poetical
heading
a
detailed
description
of
the
rencontre
which
without
too
violent
a
departure
from
the
exact
truth
yet
succeeded
in
making
such
a
powerful
impression
on
the
public
mind
and
evoked
symptoms
of
such
lively
interest
that
the
vigilant
newspaper
was
induced
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
for
the
future
on
any
further
rapprochements
between
the
spoelmann
and
grimmburg
houses
it
could
not
report
much
it
remarked
a
couple
of
times
that
his
royal
highness
prince
klaus
heinrich
when
walking
through
the
promenade
after
a
performance
at
the
court
theatre
had
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
spoelmanns
box
to
greet
the
ladies
and
in
its
report
of
the
charity
bazaar
which
took
place
in
the
middle
of
january
in
the
town
hall
a
smart
function
in
which
miss
spoelmann
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
committee
acted
as
seller
no
small
space
was
devoted
to
describing
how
prince
klaus
heinrich
when
the
court
was
making
a
round
of
the
bazaar
had
stopped
before
miss
spoelmann
stall
how
he
had
bought
a
piece
or
two
of
fancy
glass
for
miss
spoelmann
was
selling
porcelain
and
glass
and
had
lingered
a
good
eight
or
ten
minutes
at
her
stall
it
said
nothing
about
the
topic
of
the
conversation
and
yet
it
had
not
been
without
importance
the
court
with
the
exception
of
albrecht
had
appeared
in
the
town
hall
about
noon
when
klaus
heinrich
with
his
newly
bought
pieces
of
glass
in
tissue
paper
on
his
knee
drove
back
to
the
hermitage
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
visiting
delphinenort
and
inspecting
the
schloss
in
its
renovated
state
on
the
same
occasion
viewing
spoelmann
collection
of
glass
for
three
or
four
old
pieces
of
glass
had
been
included
in
miss
spoelmann
stock
which
her
father
himself
had
given
to
the
bazaar
out
of
his
collection
and
one
of
them
klaus
heinrich
had
bought
he
saw
himself
again
in
a
semicircle
of
people
stared
at
alone
in
front
of
miss
spoelmann
and
separated
from
her
by
the
with
its
vases
jugs
its
white
and
coloured
groups
of
porcelain
he
saw
her
in
her
red
fancy
dress
which
made
in
one
piece
clung
close
to
her
neat
though
childish
figure
while
it
exposed
dark
shoulders
and
arms
which
were
round
and
firm
and
yet
like
those
of
a
child
just
by
the
wrist
he
saw
the
gold
ornament
half
garland
and
half
diadem
in
the
jet
of
her
billowy
hair
that
showed
a
tendency
to
fall
in
smooth
wisps
on
her
forehead
her
big
black
inquiring
eyes
in
the
face
her
full
and
tender
mouth
pouting
with
habitual
scorn
when
she
spoke
and
round
about
her
in
the
great
vaulted
hall
had
been
the
scent
of
firs
and
a
babel
of
noise
music
the
clash
of
gongs
laughter
and
the
cries
of
sellers
he
had
admired
the
piece
of
glass
the
fine
old
beaker
with
its
ornament
of
silver
foliage
which
she
proffered
to
him
and
she
had
said
that
it
came
from
her
father
collection
has
your
father
then
got
many
fine
pieces
like
this
of
course
and
presumably
her
father
had
not
given
the
best
items
to
the
bazaar
she
could
guarantee
that
he
had
much
finer
pieces
of
glass
klaus
heinrich
would
very
much
like
to
see
them
well
that
might
easily
be
managed
miss
spoelmann
had
answered
in
her
broken
voice
while
she
pouted
and
wagged
her
head
slightly
from
side
to
side
her
father
she
meant
would
certainly
have
no
objection
to
showing
the
fruits
of
his
zeal
as
a
collector
to
one
more
of
a
long
succession
of
intelligent
visitors
the
spoelmanns
were
always
at
home
at
she
had
gone
straight
to
the
point
taking
the
hint
for
a
definite
offer
and
speaking
in
an
entirely
way
in
conclusion
to
klaus
heinrich
question
what
day
would
suit
best
she
had
answered
whichever
you
like
prince
we
shall
be
inexpressibly
delighted
we
shall
be
inexpressibly
delighted
those
were
her
words
so
mocking
and
pointed
in
the
exaggeration
that
they
almost
hurt
and
were
difficult
to
listen
to
without
wincing
how
she
had
rattled
and
hurt
the
poor
sister
in
the
hospital
the
other
day
but
all
through
there
was
something
childish
in
her
manner
of
speech
indeed
some
sounds
she
made
were
just
like
those
children
make
not
only
on
the
occasion
when
she
was
comforting
the
little
girl
about
the
inhaler
and
how
large
her
eyes
had
seemed
when
they
told
her
about
the
children
fathers
and
the
rest
of
the
sad
story
next
day
klaus
heinrich
went
to
tea
at
schloss
delphinenort
the
very
next
miss
spoelmann
had
said
he
might
come
when
it
suited
him
but
it
suited
him
the
very
next
day
and
as
the
matter
seemed
to
him
urgent
he
saw
no
point
in
putting
it
off
shortly
before
five
it
was
already
dark
he
drove
over
the
smooth
roads
of
the
town
garden
bare
and
empty
for
this
part
of
it
belonged
to
spoelmann
lit
up
the
park
the
big
square
shimmered
between
the
trees
behind
it
rose
the
white
schloss
with
its
pillared
porch
its
spacious
double
staircase
which
led
by
gentle
degrees
between
the
wings
up
to
the
first
floor
its
high
leaded
windows
its
roman
busts
in
the
niches
and
klaus
heinrich
as
he
drove
along
the
approach
avenue
of
mighty
chestnuts
saw
the
negro
with
his
staff
standing
on
guard
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
klaus
heinrich
crossed
a
brightly
lighted
stone
hall
with
a
floor
of
gilt
mosaic
and
with
white
statues
of
gods
round
it
passed
straight
over
to
the
broad
marble
staircase
down
which
the
spoelmanns
clean
shaven
with
shoulders
squared
and
arms
stiff
and
haughty
advanced
to
receive
the
guest
he
escorted
him
up
into
the
tapestried
and
where
a
couple
of
footmen
took
the
cap
and
cloak
while
the
steward
went
in
person
to
announce
him
to
his
master
the
footman
held
aside
one
of
the
tapestries
for
klaus
heinrich
who
descended
two
or
three
steps
the
scent
of
flowers
met
him
and
he
heard
the
soft
splash
of
falling
water
but
just
as
the
tapestry
closed
behind
him
so
wild
and
harsh
a
barking
was
heard
that
klaus
heinrich
half
deafened
for
a
moment
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
percival
the
collie
had
dashed
at
him
in
a
fury
he
pranced
he
capered
in
uncontrollable
passion
he
pirouetted
beat
his
sides
with
his
tail
planted
his
forefeet
on
the
floor
and
turned
wildly
round
and
round
and
seemed
like
to
burst
with
noise
a
voice
not
imma
called
him
off
and
klaus
heinrich
found
himself
in
a
winter
garden
a
glass
conservatory
with
white
marble
columns
and
a
floor
of
big
square
marble
flags
palms
of
all
kinds
filled
it
whose
trunks
and
tops
often
reached
close
up
to
the
glass
ceiling
a
consisting
of
countless
pots
arranged
like
the
stones
of
a
mosaic
lay
in
the
strong
moonlight
of
the
and
filled
the
air
with
its
scent
out
of
a
beautifully
carved
fountain
silver
streams
flowed
into
a
marble
pool
and
ducks
with
strange
and
fantastic
plumage
swam
about
on
the
illuminated
water
the
background
was
filled
by
a
stone
walk
with
columns
and
niches
it
was
countess
löwenjoul
who
advanced
towards
the
guest
and
curtseyed
with
a
smile
your
royal
highness
will
not
mind
she
said
our
percy
is
so
uproarious
besides
he
so
unaccustomed
to
visitors
but
he
never
touches
anybody
your
royal
highness
must
excuse
miss
spoelmann
she
be
back
soon
she
was
here
just
now
she
was
called
away
her
father
sent
for
her
spoelmann
will
be
delighted
and
she
conducted
klaus
heinrich
to
an
arrangement
of
basket
chairs
with
embroidered
linen
cushions
which
stood
in
front
of
a
group
of
palms
she
spoke
in
a
brisk
and
emphatic
tone
with
her
little
head
with
its
thin
hair
bent
on
one
side
and
her
white
teeth
showing
as
she
laughed
her
figure
was
distinctly
graceful
in
the
brown
dress
she
was
wearing
and
she
moved
as
freshly
and
elegantly
as
an
officer
wife
only
in
her
eyes
whose
lids
she
kept
blinking
there
was
something
of
mistrust
or
spite
something
unintelligible
they
sat
down
facing
each
other
at
the
round
on
which
lay
a
few
books
percival
exhausted
by
his
outburst
curled
himself
up
on
the
narrow
carpet
on
which
the
furniture
stood
his
black
coat
was
like
silk
with
white
paws
chest
and
muzzle
he
had
a
white
collar
yellow
eyes
and
a
parting
along
his
back
klaus
heinrich
began
a
conversation
for
conversation
sake
a
formal
dialogue
about
nothing
in
particular
which
was
all
he
could
do
i
hope
countess
that
i
have
not
come
at
an
inconvenient
time
luckily
i
need
not
feel
myself
an
unauthorized
intruder
i
do
not
know
whether
miss
spoelmann
has
told
you
she
was
so
kind
as
to
suggest
my
calling
it
was
about
those
lovely
pieces
of
glass
which
spoelmann
so
generously
gave
to
yesterday
bazaar
miss
spoelmann
thought
that
her
father
would
have
no
objection
to
letting
me
see
the
rest
of
his
collection
that
why
i
here
the
countess
ignored
the
question
whether
imma
had
told
her
of
the
arrangement
she
said
this
is
royal
highness
of
course
your
visit
is
not
inconvenient
even
if
as
i
hope
will
not
be
the
case
spoelmann
were
too
unwell
to
appear
oh
is
he
ill
in
reality
klaus
heinrich
wished
just
a
little
that
spoelmann
might
be
too
unwell
he
anticipated
his
meeting
with
him
with
vague
anxiety
he
was
feeling
ill
royal
highness
he
had
a
touch
of
fever
shivering
and
a
little
faintness
watercloose
was
with
him
for
a
long
time
this
morning
he
was
given
an
injection
of
morphia
some
question
of
an
operation
being
necessary
i
am
very
sorry
said
klaus
heinrich
quite
honestly
an
operation
how
dreadful
to
which
the
countess
answered
letting
her
eyes
wander
oh
yes
but
there
are
worse
things
in
life
many
much
worse
things
than
that
undoubtedly
said
klaus
heinrich
i
can
quite
believe
it
he
felt
his
imagination
stirred
in
a
vague
and
general
way
by
the
allusion
she
looked
at
him
with
her
head
inclined
to
one
side
and
an
expression
of
contempt
on
her
face
then
her
slightly
distended
grey
eyes
shifted
while
she
smiled
the
mysterious
smile
which
klaus
heinrich
already
knew
and
which
had
something
seductive
about
it
he
felt
it
was
necessary
to
resume
the
conversation
have
you
lived
long
with
the
spoelmanns
countess
he
asked
a
fairly
long
time
she
answered
and
appeared
to
calculate
fairly
long
i
have
lived
through
so
much
have
had
so
many
experiences
that
i
naturally
can
not
reckon
to
a
day
but
it
was
shortly
after
the
blessing
soon
after
the
blessing
was
vouchsafed
to
me
the
blessing
asked
klaus
heinrich
of
course
she
said
decidedly
with
some
agitation
for
the
blessing
happened
to
me
when
the
number
of
my
experiences
had
become
too
great
and
the
bow
had
reached
breaking
point
to
use
a
metaphor
you
are
so
young
she
continued
forgetting
to
address
him
by
his
title
so
ignorant
of
all
that
makes
the
world
so
miserable
and
so
depraved
that
you
can
form
no
conception
of
what
i
have
had
to
suffer
i
brought
an
action
in
america
which
involved
the
appearance
of
several
generals
things
came
to
light
which
were
more
than
my
temper
could
stand
i
had
to
clear
out
several
barracks
without
succeeding
in
bringing
to
light
every
loose
woman
they
hid
themselves
in
the
cupboards
some
even
under
the
floors
and
that
why
they
continue
torturing
me
beyond
measure
at
nights
i
should
at
once
go
back
to
my
schloss
in
burgundy
if
the
rain
did
not
come
through
the
roofs
the
spoelmanns
knew
that
and
that
is
why
it
was
so
obliging
of
them
to
let
me
live
with
them
indefinitely
my
only
duty
being
to
put
the
innocent
imma
on
her
guard
against
the
world
only
of
course
my
health
suffers
from
my
having
the
women
sitting
at
nights
on
my
chest
and
forcing
me
to
look
at
their
disgusting
faces
and
that
is
why
i
ask
you
to
call
me
simply
frau
meier
she
said
in
a
whisper
leaning
forward
and
touching
klaus
heinrich
arm
with
her
hand
the
walls
have
ears
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
keep
up
the
incognito
i
was
forced
to
assume
in
order
to
protect
myself
against
the
persecution
of
the
odious
creatures
you
will
do
what
i
ask
will
you
not
look
on
it
as
a
joke
a
fad
which
hurts
nobody
why
not
she
stopped
klaus
heinrich
sat
upright
and
braced
up
in
his
wicker
chair
opposite
her
and
looked
at
her
before
leaving
his
rectilineal
room
he
had
dressed
himself
with
his
valet
neumann
help
with
all
possible
care
as
his
life
in
the
public
eye
required
his
parting
ran
from
over
his
left
eye
straight
up
to
the
crown
of
his
head
without
a
hair
sticking
up
and
his
hair
was
brushed
up
into
a
crest
off
the
right
side
of
his
forehead
there
he
sat
in
his
undress
uniform
whose
high
collar
and
close
fit
helped
him
to
maintain
a
composed
attitude
the
silver
epaulettes
of
a
major
on
his
narrow
shoulders
leaning
slightly
but
not
comfortably
forward
collected
calm
with
one
foot
slightly
advanced
and
with
his
right
hand
above
his
left
on
his
his
young
face
looked
slightly
weary
from
the
unreality
the
loneliness
strictness
and
difficulty
of
his
life
he
sat
looking
at
the
countess
with
a
friendly
clear
but
composed
expression
in
his
eyes
she
stopped
disenchantment
and
disgust
showed
themselves
in
her
features
and
while
something
like
hate
towards
klaus
heinrich
flamed
up
in
her
tired
grey
eyes
she
blushed
in
the
strangest
of
ways
for
one
half
of
her
face
turned
red
the
other
white
dropping
her
eyelids
she
answered
i
have
been
living
with
the
spoelmanns
for
three
years
royal
highness
percival
darted
forward
dancing
springing
and
wagging
his
tail
he
trotted
towards
his
mistress
for
imma
spoelmann
had
come
in
raised
himself
in
a
dignified
way
on
his
hind
legs
and
laid
his
fore
paws
in
greeting
on
her
breast
his
jaws
were
wide
open
and
his
red
tongue
hung
out
between
his
teeth
he
looked
like
a
heraldic
supporter
as
he
stood
there
before
her
she
wore
a
wonderful
dress
of
silk
with
loose
hanging
sleeves
and
the
breast
covered
with
heavy
gold
embroidery
a
big
jewel
on
a
pearl
necklace
lay
on
her
bare
neck
the
skin
of
which
was
the
colour
of
smoked
meerschaum
her
hair
was
parted
on
one
side
and
coiled
though
a
few
smooth
wisps
tended
to
fall
on
her
forehead
holding
percival
head
in
her
two
narrow
ringless
little
hands
she
looked
into
his
face
saying
well
well
my
friend
what
a
welcome
we
are
glad
to
see
each
other
we
hated
being
parted
we
now
go
back
and
lie
down
and
she
put
his
paws
off
the
gold
embroidery
on
her
breast
and
set
him
on
his
four
paws
again
oh
prince
she
said
welcome
to
delphinenort
you
hate
breaking
your
promise
i
can
see
i
coming
to
sit
next
you
they
tell
us
when
tea
is
ready
it
against
all
the
rules
i
know
for
me
to
have
kept
you
waiting
but
my
father
sent
for
me
and
besides
you
had
somebody
to
entertain
you
her
bright
eyes
passed
from
klaus
heinrich
to
the
countess
and
back
in
a
rather
hesitating
way
that
quite
true
he
said
and
then
he
asked
how
spoelmann
was
and
received
a
fairly
reassuring
answer
spoelmann
would
have
the
pleasure
of
making
klaus
heinrich
acquaintance
at
he
begged
to
be
excused
till
then
what
a
lovely
pair
of
horses
klaus
heinrich
had
in
his
brougham
and
then
they
talked
about
their
horses
about
klaus
heinrich
brown
florian
from
the
hollerbrunn
stud
about
miss
spoelmann
arabian
cream
the
mare
fatma
which
had
been
given
to
spoelmann
by
an
oriental
prince
about
her
fast
hungarian
chestnuts
which
she
drove
do
you
know
the
country
round
asked
klaus
heinrich
have
you
hunted
with
the
royal
pack
have
you
been
to
the
there
are
lots
of
lovely
excursions
no
miss
spoelmann
was
not
at
all
clever
in
finding
out
new
roads
and
the
countess
well
her
whole
nature
was
unenterprising
so
they
always
chose
the
same
road
in
the
town
gardens
for
their
ride
it
was
boring
perhaps
but
miss
spoelmann
was
not
on
the
whole
so
blasé
as
to
need
constant
change
and
adventures
then
he
said
that
they
must
go
together
some
time
to
a
meet
of
the
hounds
or
to
the
pheasantry
whereupon
she
pursed
her
lips
and
said
that
that
was
an
idea
which
might
be
discussed
some
time
in
the
future
then
the
came
in
and
gravely
announced
that
tea
was
ready
they
went
through
the
tapestry
hall
with
the
marble
fireplace
conducted
by
the
strutting
butler
accompanied
by
the
dancing
percy
and
followed
by
countess
löwenjoul
has
the
countess
been
letting
her
tongue
run
away
with
her
asked
imma
without
any
particular
lowering
of
her
voice
klaus
heinrich
started
and
looked
at
the
floor
but
she
can
hear
us
he
said
softly
no
she
does
hear
us
answered
imma
i
can
read
her
face
when
she
holds
her
head
crooked
like
that
and
blinks
her
eyes
it
means
that
she
is
wandering
and
deep
in
her
thoughts
did
she
let
her
tongue
run
away
with
her
for
a
minute
or
two
said
klaus
heinrich
i
got
the
impression
that
the
countess
herself
go
every
now
and
then
she
has
had
a
lot
of
trouble
and
imma
looked
at
him
with
the
same
big
searching
dark
eyes
with
which
she
had
scanned
him
in
the
dorothea
hospital
i
tell
you
all
about
it
another
time
it
a
long
story
yes
he
said
some
other
time
next
time
on
our
ride
perhaps
on
our
ride
yes
on
our
ride
to
the
meet
or
to
the
oh
i
forgot
your
preciseness
prince
in
the
matter
of
appointments
very
well
on
our
ride
we
go
down
here
they
found
themselves
at
the
back
of
the
schloss
carpeted
steps
led
from
a
gallery
hung
with
big
pictures
down
into
the
garden
room
behind
the
glass
door
of
which
lay
the
terrace
everything
the
big
crystal
lustres
which
hung
from
the
centre
of
the
high
ceiling
the
regularly
arranged
with
gilt
frames
and
fancy
upholstering
the
heavy
white
silk
curtains
the
elaborate
clock
and
the
vases
and
gilt
lamps
on
the
white
marble
chimneypiece
in
front
of
the
tall
the
massive
gilt
candelabra
which
towered
on
either
side
of
the
entrance
everything
reminded
klaus
heinrich
of
the
old
schloss
of
the
representation
chamber
in
which
he
had
played
his
part
from
his
youth
up
only
that
the
candles
here
were
shams
with
yellow
electric
bulbs
instead
of
wicks
and
that
everything
of
the
spoelmanns
was
new
and
smart
in
schloss
delphinenort
a
footman
was
putting
the
last
touch
to
the
in
a
corner
of
the
room
klaus
heinrich
noticed
the
electric
kettle
about
which
he
had
read
in
the
has
spoelmann
been
told
asked
the
daughter
of
the
house
the
butler
bowed
then
there
nothing
she
said
quickly
and
half
mockingly
to
prevent
us
from
taking
our
places
and
beginning
without
him
come
countess
i
advise
you
prince
to
unbuckle
your
sword
unless
there
are
reasons
unknown
to
me
for
your
not
doing
so
thanks
said
klaus
heinrich
no
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
and
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
not
being
smart
enough
to
think
of
a
more
adroit
answer
the
footman
took
his
sword
and
carried
it
off
they
took
their
seats
at
the
with
the
help
of
the
butler
who
held
the
backs
and
pushed
the
chairs
under
them
then
he
retired
to
the
top
of
the
steps
where
he
remained
in
an
elegant
attitude
i
must
tell
you
prince
said
miss
spoelmann
pouring
the
water
into
the
pot
that
my
father
wo
drink
any
tea
which
i
have
not
made
with
my
own
hands
he
distrusts
all
tea
which
is
handed
round
in
cups
that
is
barred
with
us
you
have
to
put
up
with
it
oh
i
like
it
much
better
like
this
said
klaus
heinrich
it
much
more
comfortable
and
at
a
family
tea
like
this
he
broke
off
and
wondered
why
as
he
spoke
these
words
a
of
hatred
lighted
on
him
from
the
eyes
of
countess
löwenjoul
and
your
course
of
study
he
asked
may
i
ask
about
it
it
mathematics
i
know
do
you
find
it
too
much
is
it
terribly
absolutely
not
she
said
it
just
splendid
it
like
playing
in
the
breezes
so
to
speak
or
rather
out
of
the
breezes
in
a
atmosphere
it
as
cool
there
as
in
the
adirondacks
the
what
the
adirondacks
that
geography
prince
mountains
over
in
the
states
with
lovely
snowfields
we
have
a
country
cottage
there
where
we
go
in
may
in
summer
we
used
to
go
to
the
at
any
rate
he
said
i
can
testify
to
your
zeal
in
your
studies
you
do
not
like
being
prevented
from
arriving
punctually
at
your
lectures
i
have
yet
asked
you
whether
you
reached
that
one
the
other
day
up
to
time
the
other
day
yes
a
week
or
two
ago
after
the
contretemps
with
the
change
of
guard
dear
dear
prince
now
you
are
beginning
that
too
that
story
seems
to
have
reached
from
hut
to
palace
had
i
known
what
a
bother
was
going
to
come
of
it
i
would
rather
have
gone
three
times
round
the
whole
schlossplatz
it
even
got
into
the
newspapers
i
told
and
now
of
course
the
whole
town
thinks
i
am
a
regular
fiend
for
temper
and
rudeness
but
i
am
the
most
peaceful
creature
in
the
world
and
only
do
like
being
ordered
about
am
i
a
fiend
countess
i
demand
a
truthful
answer
no
you
an
angel
said
countess
löwenjoul
h
angel
that
too
much
that
too
far
the
other
way
countess
no
said
klaus
heinrich
no
not
too
far
i
entirely
believe
the
countess
i
much
honoured
but
how
did
your
highness
hear
about
the
adventure
through
the
newspapers
i
was
an
of
it
said
klaus
heinrich
an
yes
i
happened
to
be
standing
at
the
window
of
the
officers
mess
and
saw
the
whole
thing
from
beginning
to
end
miss
spoelmann
blushed
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
pale
skin
of
her
face
deepened
in
colour
well
prince
she
said
i
assume
that
you
had
nothing
better
to
do
at
the
moment
better
he
cried
but
it
was
a
splendid
sight
i
give
you
my
word
that
never
in
my
life
percival
who
was
lying
with
his
forepaws
crossed
by
miss
spoelmann
raised
his
head
with
a
look
of
tense
expectancy
and
beat
the
carpet
with
his
tail
at
the
same
moment
the
butler
began
to
run
as
fast
as
his
ponderous
frame
would
let
him
down
the
steps
to
the
lofty
over
against
the
and
swiftly
pulled
aside
the
whole
silk
portière
sticking
his
double
chin
the
while
into
the
air
with
a
majestic
expression
samuel
spoelmann
the
millionaire
walked
in
he
was
a
man
of
neat
build
with
a
strange
face
he
was
clean
shaven
with
red
cheeks
and
a
prominent
nose
his
little
eyes
were
of
a
metallic
like
those
of
little
children
and
animals
and
had
an
absent
and
peevish
look
the
upper
part
of
his
head
was
bald
but
behind
and
on
his
temples
spoelmann
had
a
quantity
of
grey
hair
dressed
in
a
fashion
not
often
seen
among
us
he
wore
it
neither
short
nor
long
but
brushed
up
sticking
out
though
cropped
on
the
nape
and
round
his
ears
his
mouth
was
small
and
finely
chiselled
dressed
in
a
black
with
a
velvet
waistcoat
on
which
lay
a
long
thin
and
soft
slippers
on
his
feet
he
advanced
quickly
to
the
with
a
cross
and
expression
on
his
face
but
his
face
cleared
up
it
regained
composure
and
tenderness
when
he
caught
sight
of
his
daughter
imma
had
gone
to
meet
him
greeting
most
excellent
father
she
said
and
throwing
her
brown
little
arms
in
their
loose
hanging
sleeves
round
his
neck
she
kissed
him
on
the
bald
spot
which
he
offered
her
as
he
inclined
his
head
of
course
you
knew
she
continued
that
prince
klaus
heinrich
was
coming
to
tea
with
us
no
i
delighted
delighted
said
spoelmann
no
less
readily
and
in
a
grating
voice
please
do
move
he
said
at
once
and
while
he
shook
hands
spoelmann
hand
was
thin
and
by
his
unstarched
white
cuff
with
the
prince
who
was
standing
modestly
by
the
table
he
nodded
repeatedly
to
one
side
or
the
other
that
was
his
way
of
greeting
klaus
heinrich
he
was
an
alien
an
invalid
and
a
man
apart
as
regards
wealth
he
was
forgiven
and
nothing
further
was
expected
of
him
klaus
heinrich
recognized
the
fact
and
took
pains
to
recover
his
you
are
at
home
here
in
a
sense
added
spoelmann
cutting
the
conversation
short
and
a
passing
gleam
of
malice
played
round
his
mouth
then
he
gave
the
others
an
example
by
sitting
down
it
was
the
chair
between
imma
and
klaus
heinrich
opposite
the
countess
and
the
veranda
door
which
the
butler
pushed
under
him
as
spoelmann
showed
no
intention
of
apologizing
for
his
unpunctuality
klaus
heinrich
said
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
unwell
this
morning
spoelmann
i
hope
you
are
better
thanks
better
not
but
all
right
answered
spoelmann
crossly
how
many
spoonfuls
did
you
put
in
he
asked
his
daughter
he
was
alluding
to
the
tea
she
had
filled
his
cup
and
she
handed
it
to
him
four
said
she
one
for
each
person
nobody
shall
say
that
i
stint
my
father
what
that
answered
spoelmann
i
not
you
ought
to
have
your
tongue
clipped
and
he
took
from
a
silver
box
a
kind
of
rusk
which
seemed
to
be
his
own
special
dainty
broke
it
and
dipped
it
peevishly
in
the
golden
tea
which
he
like
his
daughter
drank
without
milk
or
sugar
klaus
heinrich
began
over
again
i
am
much
excited
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
your
collection
mr
spoelmann
all
right
answered
spoelmann
so
you
want
to
see
my
glass
are
you
an
amateur
a
collector
perhaps
no
said
klaus
heinrich
my
love
for
glass
has
not
extended
to
my
becoming
a
collector
no
time
asked
spoelmann
do
your
military
duties
take
so
much
time
klaus
heinrich
answered
i
no
longer
on
the
active
list
spoelmann
i
am
la
of
my
regiment
i
wear
the
uniform
all
i
see
make
believe
said
spoelmann
harshly
what
do
you
do
all
day
then
klaus
heinrich
had
stopped
drinking
tea
had
pushed
his
things
away
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
which
demanded
his
undivided
attention
he
sat
upright
and
defended
himself
feeling
the
while
that
imma
spoelmann
big
black
searching
eyes
were
resting
on
him
i
have
duties
at
court
with
the
ceremonies
and
big
occasions
i
have
also
to
represent
the
state
in
a
military
capacity
at
the
of
recruits
and
the
presentation
of
colours
then
i
have
to
hold
levées
as
deputy
for
my
brother
the
grand
duke
and
then
there
are
little
journeys
on
duty
to
the
provincial
centres
for
unveilings
and
dedications
and
other
public
solemnities
i
see
said
spoelmann
ceremonies
solemnities
food
for
spectators
no
that
sort
of
thing
beyond
me
i
tell
you
once
for
all
that
i
would
give
a
farthing
for
your
calling
that
my
standpoint
sir
i
entirely
understand
said
klaus
heinrich
he
sat
up
stiffly
in
his
uniform
and
smiled
uneasily
of
course
it
needs
practice
like
everything
else
spoelmann
went
on
in
a
little
less
bitter
tone
of
voice
practice
and
training
i
can
see
for
myself
i
shall
never
as
long
as
i
live
cease
feeling
angry
when
i
am
obliged
to
play
the
prodigy
i
only
hope
said
klaus
heinrich
that
our
people
are
not
wanting
in
respect
thanks
not
so
bad
answered
spoelmann
the
people
are
at
least
friendly
here
one
does
see
murder
written
in
their
eyes
i
hope
spoelmann
and
klaus
heinrich
felt
more
at
his
ease
now
that
the
conversation
had
turned
and
the
questioning
lay
with
him
that
notwithstanding
the
unusual
circumstances
you
continue
to
enjoy
your
stay
amongst
us
thanks
said
spoelmann
i
quite
comfortable
and
the
water
is
the
only
thing
which
really
does
do
me
some
good
you
did
not
find
it
a
wrench
to
leave
america
klaus
heinrich
felt
a
look
a
quick
suspicious
shy
look
which
he
could
not
interpret
no
said
spoelmann
sharply
and
crossly
that
was
all
his
answer
to
the
question
whether
he
felt
it
a
wrench
to
leave
america
a
pause
ensued
countess
löwenjoul
held
her
smooth
little
head
inclined
to
one
side
and
smiled
a
distant
smile
miss
spoelmann
watched
klaus
heinrich
fixedly
with
her
big
black
eyes
as
if
testing
the
effect
of
her
father
extraordinary
boorishness
on
the
guest
indeed
klaus
heinrich
felt
that
she
was
waiting
with
resignation
and
sympathy
for
him
to
get
up
and
take
his
departure
for
good
and
all
he
met
her
eyes
and
remained
spoelmann
for
his
part
drew
out
a
gold
case
and
took
out
a
fat
cigarette
which
when
lighted
diffused
a
delicious
fragrance
smoke
he
asked
and
as
klaus
heinrich
found
that
there
was
no
objection
he
helped
himself
after
spoelmann
out
of
the
proffered
case
they
then
discussed
various
topics
before
proceeding
to
an
inspection
of
the
glass
chiefly
klaus
heinrich
and
miss
spoelmann
for
the
thoughts
were
wandering
and
spoelmann
only
interpolated
a
cross
remark
now
and
then
the
local
theatre
the
huge
ship
in
which
the
spoelmanns
had
crossed
to
europe
no
they
had
not
used
their
yacht
for
the
purpose
its
primary
object
was
to
take
spoelmann
to
sea
in
the
evening
in
the
heat
of
summer
when
he
was
tied
to
his
business
and
imma
and
the
countess
were
in
newport
he
used
to
pass
the
night
on
deck
she
was
now
lying
at
venice
but
they
had
crossed
in
a
huge
steamer
a
floating
hotel
with
concert
rooms
and
gymnasia
she
had
five
storeys
said
miss
spoelmann
counting
from
below
asked
klaus
heinrich
and
she
answered
at
once
of
course
six
counting
from
above
he
got
muddled
and
lost
his
bearings
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
realized
that
she
was
making
fun
of
him
then
he
tried
to
explain
himself
and
to
make
his
simple
question
clear
explaining
that
he
meant
to
ask
whether
she
included
the
holds
the
cellars
so
to
speak
in
the
five
in
short
to
prove
that
he
was
not
lacking
in
common
sense
and
at
last
he
joined
heartily
in
the
merriment
which
was
the
result
of
his
efforts
as
for
the
court
theatre
miss
spoelmann
gave
it
as
her
opinion
with
a
pout
and
a
wag
of
the
head
that
the
actress
who
played
the
should
be
strongly
recommended
to
go
through
the
cure
at
marienbad
coupled
with
a
course
of
lessons
in
dancing
and
deportment
while
the
hero
should
be
warned
that
a
voice
as
resonant
as
his
should
be
used
most
sparingly
even
in
private
life
all
the
same
miss
spoelmann
expressed
her
warm
admiration
for
the
theatre
in
question
klaus
heinrich
laughed
and
wondered
a
little
oppressed
by
so
much
smartness
how
well
she
spoke
how
pointed
and
incisive
were
her
words
they
discussed
the
operas
also
and
the
plays
which
had
been
produced
during
the
winter
and
imma
spoelmann
contradicted
klaus
judgments
contradicted
him
in
every
case
just
as
if
she
thought
that
not
to
contradict
would
show
a
mean
spirit
the
superior
wit
of
her
tongue
left
him
dazed
and
the
great
black
eyes
in
her
face
glittered
from
sheer
joy
in
her
dialectic
skill
while
spoelmann
leaned
back
in
his
chair
holding
the
fat
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
blinking
through
its
smoke
and
gazed
at
his
daughter
with
fond
satisfaction
more
than
once
klaus
heinrich
showed
in
his
face
the
look
of
pained
bewilderment
which
he
had
noticed
on
a
previous
occasion
on
the
face
of
the
good
sister
and
yet
he
felt
convinced
that
it
was
not
imma
spoelmann
intention
to
wound
his
feelings
that
she
did
not
consider
him
humbled
because
he
was
not
successful
in
standing
up
to
her
that
she
rather
let
his
poor
answers
pass
as
if
she
considered
that
he
had
no
need
of
a
sharp
wit
to
defend
him
it
was
only
she
who
had
but
how
was
that
and
why
he
thought
involuntarily
of
ueberbein
at
many
of
her
sallies
of
the
blusterer
ueberbein
who
was
a
natural
misfortune
and
had
grown
up
in
conditions
which
he
described
as
favourable
a
youth
of
misery
loneliness
and
misfortune
shut
out
from
the
blessings
of
fortune
such
a
man
knew
no
luxury
no
comfort
he
saw
himself
clearly
and
cruelly
thrown
on
his
own
resources
which
assuredly
gave
him
an
advantage
over
those
who
knew
not
necessity
but
imma
spoelmann
sat
there
in
her
dress
at
the
table
reclining
indolently
with
the
mocking
look
of
a
spoiled
child
there
she
sat
in
confident
ease
while
her
tongue
ran
on
sharply
and
freely
as
befitted
an
atmosphere
of
refinement
and
lively
wit
but
why
did
she
give
it
play
klaus
heinrich
pondered
the
question
the
while
they
discussed
atlantic
steamers
and
plays
he
sat
bolt
upright
at
the
table
in
a
dignified
and
uncomfortable
attitude
while
he
concealed
his
left
hand
and
more
than
once
he
felt
a
sidelong
glance
of
hatred
from
the
eyes
of
countess
löwenjoul
a
servant
came
in
and
handed
spoelmann
a
telegram
on
a
silver
salver
spoelmann
tore
it
open
crossly
glanced
through
it
blinking
and
with
the
remains
of
his
cigarette
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
threw
it
back
on
the
salver
with
the
curt
order
mr
phlebs
thereupon
he
lighted
a
new
cigarette
miss
spoelmann
said
in
spite
of
distinct
medical
orders
that
the
fifth
cigarette
you
had
let
me
tell
you
that
the
unbridled
passion
with
which
you
abandon
yourself
to
the
vice
little
beseems
your
grey
hairs
spoelmann
obviously
tried
to
laugh
and
as
obviously
failed
the
acid
tone
of
his
daughter
words
was
not
to
his
liking
and
he
flushed
up
silence
he
snarled
you
think
you
can
say
anything
in
fun
but
please
spare
me
your
saucy
jokes
chatterbox
klaus
heinrich
appalled
looked
at
imma
who
turned
her
big
eyes
on
her
father
angry
face
and
then
sadly
dropped
her
head
of
course
she
had
not
meant
any
offence
she
had
simply
amused
herself
with
the
strange
swelling
words
which
she
used
to
poke
her
fun
she
had
expected
to
raise
a
laugh
and
had
failed
dismally
father
darling
father
she
said
beseechingly
and
crossed
over
to
stroke
spoelmann
flushed
cheeks
surely
he
grumbled
on
you
grown
out
of
that
sort
of
thing
by
now
but
then
he
yielded
to
her
blandishments
let
her
kiss
the
top
of
his
head
and
swallowed
his
anger
klaus
heinrich
when
peace
was
restored
alluded
to
the
collection
of
glass
whereupon
the
party
left
the
and
went
into
the
adjoining
museum
with
the
exception
of
countess
löwenjoul
who
withdrew
with
a
deep
curtsey
spoelmann
himself
switched
on
the
electric
light
in
the
chandeliers
handsome
cabinets
in
the
style
of
the
whole
schloss
with
swelling
curves
and
rounded
glass
doors
alternated
with
rich
silk
chairs
all
round
the
room
in
these
cabinets
spoelmann
collection
of
glass
was
displayed
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
most
complete
collection
in
either
hemisphere
and
the
glass
which
klaus
heinrich
had
acquired
was
merely
a
most
modest
sample
of
it
it
began
in
one
corner
of
the
room
with
the
earliest
artistic
productions
of
the
industry
with
finds
of
heathenish
designs
from
the
culture
of
the
earliest
times
then
came
the
products
of
the
east
and
west
of
every
epoch
next
wreathed
flourished
and
imposing
vases
and
beakers
from
venetian
and
costly
pieces
from
bohemian
huts
german
tankards
picturesque
guild
and
electorate
bowls
mixed
with
grotesque
animals
and
comic
figures
huge
crystal
cups
which
reminded
one
of
the
luck
of
edenhall
in
the
song
and
in
whose
facets
the
light
broke
and
sparkled
glasses
like
the
holy
grail
and
finally
the
best
samples
of
the
latest
development
of
the
art
fragile
blossoms
on
impossibly
brittle
stems
and
fancy
glasses
in
the
latest
fashionable
shape
made
iridescent
with
the
vapours
of
precious
metals
the
three
followed
by
percival
who
also
examined
the
collection
walked
slowly
round
the
hall
and
spoelmann
related
in
his
harsh
voice
the
origin
of
particular
pieces
taking
them
carefully
off
their
velvet
stands
with
his
thin
hand
and
holding
them
up
to
the
electric
light
klaus
heinrich
had
had
plenty
of
practice
in
visits
of
inspection
in
putting
questions
and
making
adroit
remarks
so
that
he
was
well
able
at
the
same
time
to
ponder
over
imma
spoelmann
mode
of
expressing
herself
that
peculiar
mode
which
worried
him
not
a
little
what
amazing
freedom
she
allowed
herself
what
extraordinary
remarks
she
allowed
herself
to
make
passion
vice
where
did
she
get
the
words
from
where
did
she
learn
to
use
them
so
glibly
had
not
countess
löwenjoul
who
herself
dealt
with
the
same
topics
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
and
had
obviously
seen
the
seamy
side
of
life
described
her
as
quite
innocent
and
the
description
was
undoubtedly
correct
for
was
she
not
an
exception
by
birth
like
himself
brought
up
like
a
girl
born
to
be
queen
kept
apart
from
the
busy
strife
of
men
and
from
all
the
turmoil
to
which
those
sinister
words
corresponded
in
the
life
of
reality
but
she
had
uttered
the
words
glibly
and
had
treated
them
as
a
joke
yes
that
was
it
this
dainty
creature
in
her
gown
was
merely
a
wielder
of
words
she
knew
no
more
of
life
than
those
words
she
played
with
the
most
serious
and
most
awful
of
them
as
with
coloured
stones
and
was
puzzled
when
she
made
people
angry
by
their
use
klaus
heinrich
heart
as
he
thought
of
this
filled
with
sympathy
it
was
nearly
seven
when
he
asked
for
his
carriage
to
be
called
slightly
uneasy
about
his
long
stay
in
view
of
the
court
and
the
public
his
departure
evoked
a
fresh
and
terrifying
demonstration
on
the
part
of
percival
the
collie
every
alteration
or
interruption
in
a
situation
seemed
to
throw
the
noble
animal
off
his
moral
balance
quivering
yelping
and
deaf
to
all
blandishments
he
stormed
through
the
rooms
and
the
hall
and
up
and
down
the
steps
drowning
the
words
of
in
his
hubbub
the
butler
did
the
prince
the
honours
as
far
as
the
floor
with
the
statues
of
gods
spoelmann
did
not
accompany
him
any
distance
miss
spoelmann
made
the
position
clear
i
am
convinced
that
your
sojourn
in
the
bosom
of
our
family
has
charmed
you
prince
and
he
was
left
wondering
whether
the
joke
lay
in
the
expression
the
bosom
of
our
family
or
in
the
actual
fact
anyhow
klaus
heinrich
was
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
leaning
back
in
the
corner
of
his
brougham
rather
sore
and
battered
and
yet
stimulated
by
the
unusual
treatment
he
had
experienced
he
drove
home
through
the
dark
town
gardens
to
the
hermitage
returned
to
his
sober
empire
room
where
he
dined
with
von
and
next
day
he
read
the
comments
of
the
they
amounted
only
to
a
statement
that
yesterday
his
royal
highness
prince
klaus
heinrich
went
to
schloss
delphinenort
for
tea
and
inspected
spoelmann
renowned
collection
of
fancy
glass
and
klaus
heinrich
continued
to
live
his
unreal
life
and
to
carry
out
his
exalted
calling
he
uttered
his
gracious
speeches
made
his
gestures
represented
his
people
at
the
court
and
at
the
president
of
the
council
great
ball
gave
free
audiences
lunched
in
the
mess
of
the
grenadier
guards
showed
himself
at
the
court
theatre
and
bestowed
on
this
and
that
district
of
the
country
the
privilege
of
his
presence
with
a
smile
and
with
heels
together
he
carried
out
all
due
formalities
and
did
his
irksome
duty
with
complete
albeit
he
had
at
this
time
so
much
to
think
of
about
the
peppery
spoelmann
the
countess
löwenjoul
the
percy
and
especially
about
imma
the
daughter
of
the
house
many
a
question
to
which
his
first
visit
to
delphinenort
had
given
rise
he
was
not
yet
in
a
position
to
answer
but
only
succeeded
in
solving
as
the
result
of
further
intercourse
with
the
spoelmanns
which
he
maintained
to
the
eager
and
at
last
feverish
interest
of
the
public
and
which
advanced
a
step
further
when
the
prince
in
the
early
morning
one
day
to
the
astonishment
of
his
suite
his
servants
and
himself
indeed
partly
involuntarily
and
as
if
carried
along
by
destiny
appeared
alone
and
on
horseback
at
delphinenort
for
the
purpose
of
taking
miss
spoelmann
whom
he
disturbed
in
her
mathematical
studies
at
the
top
of
the
schloss
for
a
ride
the
grip
of
winter
had
relaxed
early
in
this
year
after
a
mild
january
the
middle
of
february
had
seen
the
coming
of
a
preliminary
spring
with
birds
and
sunshine
and
balmy
breezes
and
as
klaus
heinrich
lay
on
the
first
of
these
mornings
at
the
hermitage
in
his
roomy
old
mahogany
bed
from
one
of
whose
posts
the
spherical
crown
was
missing
he
felt
himself
as
it
were
impelled
by
a
strange
hand
and
irresistibly
inspired
to
deeds
of
boldness
he
rang
the
for
neumann
they
only
had
at
the
hermitage
and
ordered
florian
to
be
ready
saddled
in
an
hour
time
should
a
horse
be
got
ready
for
the
groom
too
no
it
was
not
necessary
klaus
heinrich
said
that
he
wanted
to
ride
alone
then
he
gave
himself
into
neumann
skilful
hands
for
his
morning
toilette
breakfasted
impatiently
below
in
the
garden
room
and
mounted
his
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
with
his
spurred
in
the
stirrups
the
yellow
reins
in
his
right
hand
and
the
left
planted
on
his
hip
under
his
open
cloak
he
rode
at
a
walking
pace
through
the
soft
morning
scanning
the
still
bare
branches
for
the
birds
whose
twittering
he
heard
he
rode
through
the
public
part
of
his
park
through
the
town
gardens
and
the
grounds
of
delphinenort
he
reached
it
at
nine
great
was
the
general
surprise
at
the
main
gate
he
gave
florian
over
to
an
english
groom
the
butler
who
was
crossing
the
mosaic
hall
busy
on
his
household
duties
stood
still
taken
aback
at
the
sight
of
klaus
heinrich
to
the
inquiry
which
the
prince
addressed
to
him
in
a
clear
and
almost
haughty
voice
about
the
ladies
he
did
not
even
reply
but
turned
helplessly
towards
the
marble
staircase
gazing
dumbly
at
the
top
step
for
there
stood
spoelmann
it
seemed
that
he
had
just
finished
breakfast
and
was
in
the
best
of
tempers
his
hands
were
plunged
deep
in
his
pockets
his
lounge
coat
drawn
back
from
his
velvet
waistcoat
and
the
blue
smoke
of
his
cigarette
was
making
him
blink
well
young
prince
he
said
and
stared
down
at
him
klaus
heinrich
saluted
and
hurried
up
the
red
he
felt
that
the
situation
could
only
be
saved
by
swiftness
and
so
to
speak
by
an
attack
by
storm
you
will
be
astounded
spoelmann
he
said
at
this
early
hour
he
was
out
of
breath
and
the
fact
disturbed
him
greatly
he
was
so
little
used
to
it
spoelmann
answered
him
by
a
look
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
could
control
himself
but
desired
an
explanation
the
fact
is
we
have
an
appointment
said
klaus
heinrich
he
was
standing
two
steps
below
the
millionaire
and
was
speaking
up
at
him
an
appointment
for
a
ride
between
miss
imma
and
myself
i
have
promised
to
show
the
ladies
the
and
the
court
kennels
miss
imma
told
me
that
she
knew
nothing
about
the
surrounding
country
it
was
agreed
that
on
the
first
fine
day
it
such
a
lovely
day
it
is
of
course
subject
to
your
approval
spoelmann
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
a
face
as
if
to
say
approval
why
so
my
daughter
is
grown
up
he
said
i
do
interfere
if
she
rides
she
rides
but
i
do
think
she
has
time
you
must
find
that
out
for
yourself
she
in
there
and
spoelmann
pointed
his
chin
towards
the
tapestry
door
through
which
klaus
heinrich
had
already
once
passed
thanks
said
klaus
heinrich
i
go
and
see
for
myself
and
he
ran
up
the
remaining
steps
pushed
the
tapestry
hanging
aside
with
a
determined
gesture
and
went
down
the
steps
into
the
sunlit
winter
garden
in
front
of
the
splashing
fountain
and
the
basin
with
ducks
sat
imma
spoelmann
leaning
over
a
table
her
back
turned
to
the
incomer
her
hair
was
down
it
hung
black
and
glossy
on
each
side
of
her
head
covered
her
shoulders
and
allowed
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
shadow
of
the
childlike
quarter
profile
of
her
face
which
showed
white
as
ivory
against
the
darkness
of
her
hair
there
she
sat
absorbed
in
her
studies
working
at
the
figures
in
the
notebook
before
her
her
lips
pressed
on
the
back
of
her
left
hand
and
her
right
grasping
the
pen
the
countess
too
was
there
also
busy
writing
she
sat
some
way
off
under
the
palms
where
klaus
heinrich
had
first
conversed
with
her
and
wrote
sitting
upright
with
her
head
on
one
side
a
pile
of
closely
scribbled
lying
at
her
side
the
clank
of
klaus
spurs
made
her
look
up
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
for
two
seconds
the
long
pen
poised
in
her
hand
then
rose
and
curtseyed
imma
she
said
his
royal
highness
prince
klaus
heinrich
is
here
miss
spoelmann
turned
quickly
round
in
her
basket
chair
shook
her
hair
back
and
gazed
without
speaking
at
the
intruder
with
big
startled
eyes
until
klaus
heinrich
had
bid
the
ladies
with
a
military
salute
then
she
said
in
her
broken
voice
to
you
too
prince
but
you
are
too
late
for
breakfast
we
finished
long
ago
klaus
heinrich
laughed
well
it
lucky
he
said
that
both
parties
have
had
breakfast
for
now
we
can
start
at
once
for
a
ride
a
ride
yes
as
we
agreed
we
agreed
no
do
say
that
you
forgotten
he
said
pleadingly
did
i
promise
to
show
you
the
country
round
were
we
going
for
a
ride
together
when
it
was
fine
well
it
glorious
just
look
out
it
not
a
bad
day
she
said
but
you
go
too
fast
prince
i
remember
that
there
was
some
suggestion
of
a
ride
at
some
future
time
but
surely
not
so
soon
as
this
might
i
not
at
least
have
expected
some
sort
of
notification
if
your
highness
will
allow
the
word
you
must
allow
that
i
ca
ride
like
this
about
here
and
she
stood
up
to
show
her
morning
dress
which
consisted
of
a
loose
gown
of
silk
and
an
open
jacket
no
he
said
unfortunately
you
can
not
but
i
wait
here
while
you
both
change
it
quite
early
uncommonly
early
but
in
the
second
place
i
am
rather
busy
with
my
innocent
studies
as
you
saw
i
got
a
lecture
at
eleven
no
he
cried
you
must
not
grind
at
algebra
miss
imma
you
must
not
play
in
the
vacuum
as
you
put
it
look
at
the
sun
may
i
and
he
went
to
the
table
and
took
up
the
notebook
what
he
saw
made
his
head
swim
a
fantastic
a
sabbath
of
abbreviated
symbols
written
in
a
childish
round
hand
which
was
the
obvious
result
of
miss
spoelmann
peculiar
way
of
holding
her
pen
covered
the
pages
there
were
greek
and
latin
letters
of
various
heights
crossed
and
cancelled
arranged
above
and
below
cross
lines
covered
by
other
lines
enclosed
in
round
brackets
formulated
in
square
brackets
single
letters
pushed
forward
like
sentries
kept
guard
above
the
main
bodies
cabalistic
signs
quite
unintelligible
to
the
lay
mind
cast
their
arms
round
letters
and
ciphers
while
fractions
stood
in
front
of
them
and
ciphers
and
letters
hovered
round
their
tops
and
bottoms
strange
syllables
abbreviations
of
mysterious
words
were
scattered
everywhere
and
between
the
columns
were
written
sentences
and
remarks
in
ordinary
language
whose
sense
was
equally
beyond
the
normal
intelligence
and
conveyed
no
more
to
the
reader
than
an
incantation
klaus
heinrich
looked
at
the
slight
form
which
stood
by
him
in
the
shimmering
frock
becurtained
by
her
dark
hair
and
in
whose
little
head
all
this
lived
and
meant
something
he
said
can
you
really
waste
a
lovely
morning
over
all
this
stuff
a
glance
of
anger
met
him
from
her
big
eyes
then
she
answered
with
a
pout
your
highness
seems
to
wish
to
excuse
yourself
for
the
want
of
intelligence
you
recently
displayed
with
regard
to
your
own
exalted
calling
no
he
said
not
so
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
respect
your
studies
most
highly
i
grant
that
they
bother
me
i
could
never
understand
anything
of
that
sort
i
also
grant
that
i
feel
some
resentment
against
them
as
they
seem
likely
to
prevent
us
from
going
for
a
ride
oh
i
not
the
only
one
to
interfere
with
your
wish
for
exercise
prince
there
the
countess
too
she
was
writing
chronicling
the
experiences
of
her
life
not
for
the
world
but
for
private
circulation
and
i
guarantee
that
the
result
will
be
a
work
which
will
teach
you
as
well
as
me
a
good
deal
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
but
i
am
equally
sure
that
the
countess
is
incapable
of
refusing
a
request
from
you
and
my
father
there
the
next
you
know
his
temper
will
he
consent
he
has
consented
if
you
ride
you
ride
those
were
his
words
you
have
made
sure
of
him
beforehand
then
i
really
beginning
to
admire
your
circumspection
you
have
assumed
the
rôle
of
a
field
marshal
although
you
are
not
really
a
soldier
only
a
one
as
you
told
us
long
ago
but
there
yet
one
more
obstacle
and
that
is
decisive
it
going
to
rain
no
that
a
very
weak
one
the
sun
is
shining
it
going
to
rain
the
air
is
much
too
soft
i
made
sure
of
it
when
we
were
in
the
before
breakfast
come
and
look
at
the
barometer
if
you
do
believe
me
it
hanging
in
the
hall
they
went
out
into
the
tapestry
hall
where
a
big
hung
near
the
marble
fireplace
the
countess
went
with
them
klaus
heinrich
said
it
gone
up
your
highness
is
pleased
to
deceive
yourself
answered
miss
spoelmann
the
refraction
misleads
you
that
beyond
me
the
refraction
misleads
you
i
do
know
what
that
is
miss
spoelmann
it
the
same
as
with
the
adirondacks
i
not
had
much
schooling
that
a
necessary
result
of
my
kind
of
existence
you
must
make
allowances
for
me
oh
i
humbly
beg
pardon
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
one
must
use
ordinary
words
when
talking
to
your
highness
you
are
standing
crooked
to
the
hand
and
that
makes
it
look
to
you
as
if
it
had
risen
if
you
would
bring
yourself
to
stand
straight
in
front
of
the
glass
you
would
see
that
the
black
has
not
risen
above
the
gold
hand
but
has
actually
dropped
a
little
below
it
i
really
believe
you
are
right
said
klaus
heinrich
sadly
the
atmospheric
pressure
there
is
higher
than
i
thought
it
is
lower
than
you
thought
but
how
about
the
falling
quicksilver
the
quicksilver
falls
at
low
pressure
not
at
high
royal
highness
now
i
absolutely
lost
i
think
prince
that
you
exaggerating
your
ignorance
by
way
of
a
joke
so
as
to
hide
what
its
extent
really
is
but
as
the
atmospheric
pressure
is
so
high
that
the
quicksilver
drops
thus
showing
an
absolute
disregard
for
the
laws
of
nature
let
go
for
a
ride
countess
shall
we
i
can
not
assume
the
responsibility
of
sending
the
prince
back
home
again
now
that
he
has
once
come
he
can
wait
in
there
till
ready
when
imma
spoelmann
and
the
countess
came
back
to
the
winter
garden
they
were
dressed
for
riding
imma
in
a
black
habit
with
and
a
felt
hat
the
countess
in
black
cloth
with
a
man
starched
shirt
and
high
hat
they
went
together
down
the
steps
through
the
mosaic
hall
and
out
into
the
open
air
where
between
the
colonnade
and
the
big
basin
two
grooms
were
waiting
with
the
horses
but
they
had
not
yet
mounted
when
with
a
loud
barking
which
was
the
expression
of
his
wild
excitement
percival
the
collie
prancing
and
leaping
about
tore
out
of
the
schloss
and
began
a
frenzied
dance
round
the
horses
who
tossed
their
heads
uneasily
i
thought
so
said
imma
patting
her
favourite
fatma
head
there
was
no
hiding
it
from
him
he
found
it
all
out
at
the
last
moment
now
he
intends
to
come
with
us
and
make
a
fine
about
it
too
shall
we
drop
the
whole
thing
prince
but
although
klaus
heinrich
understood
that
he
might
just
as
well
have
allowed
the
groom
to
ride
in
front
with
the
silver
trumpet
so
far
as
calling
public
attention
to
their
expedition
was
concerned
yet
he
said
cheerfully
that
percival
must
come
too
he
was
a
member
of
the
family
and
must
learn
the
neighbourhood
like
the
rest
well
where
shall
we
go
asked
imma
as
they
rode
at
a
walk
down
the
chestnut
avenue
she
rode
between
klaus
heinrich
and
the
countess
percival
barked
in
the
van
the
english
groom
in
cockaded
hat
and
yellow
rode
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
the
court
kennels
are
fine
answered
klaus
heinrich
but
it
is
a
bit
farther
to
the
and
we
have
time
before
lunch
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
schloss
i
spent
three
years
there
as
a
boy
it
was
a
seminary
you
know
with
tutors
and
other
boys
of
my
age
that
where
i
got
to
know
my
friend
ueberbein
doctor
ueberbein
my
favourite
tutor
you
have
a
friend
asked
miss
spoelmann
with
some
surprise
and
gazed
at
him
you
must
tell
me
about
him
some
time
and
you
were
educated
at
the
were
you
then
we
must
see
it
because
obviously
set
on
it
trot
she
said
as
they
turned
into
a
loose
there
lies
your
hermitage
prince
there
plenty
for
the
ducks
to
eat
in
your
pond
let
give
a
wide
berth
to
the
if
that
does
not
take
us
far
out
of
our
way
klaus
heinrich
agreed
so
they
left
the
park
and
trotted
across
country
to
reach
the
which
led
to
their
goal
to
the
in
the
town
gardens
they
were
greeted
with
surprise
by
a
few
promenaders
whose
greetings
klaus
heinrich
acknowledged
by
raising
his
hand
to
his
cap
imma
spoelmann
with
a
grave
and
rather
embarrassed
inclination
of
her
dark
head
in
the
hat
by
now
they
had
reached
the
open
country
and
were
no
longer
likely
to
meet
people
now
and
then
a
peasant
cart
rolled
along
the
road
or
a
crouching
bicyclist
ploughed
his
way
along
it
but
they
turned
aside
from
the
road
when
they
reached
the
which
provided
better
going
for
their
horses
percival
danced
backwards
in
front
of
them
feverish
and
restless
as
ever
turning
springing
and
wagging
his
tail
his
breath
came
fast
his
tongue
hung
far
out
of
his
foaming
jaws
and
he
vented
his
nervous
exaltation
in
a
succession
of
short
sobbing
yelps
farther
on
he
dashed
off
following
some
scent
with
pricked
ears
and
short
springs
while
his
wild
barking
echoed
through
the
air
they
discussed
fatma
which
klaus
heinrich
had
not
yet
seen
close
and
which
he
admired
immensely
fatma
had
a
long
muscular
neck
and
small
nodding
head
with
fiery
eyes
she
had
the
slender
legs
of
the
arab
type
and
a
bushy
tail
she
was
white
as
the
moonlight
and
saddled
girt
and
bridled
with
white
leather
florian
a
rather
sleepy
brown
with
a
short
back
hogged
mane
and
yellow
stockings
looked
as
homely
as
a
donkey
by
the
side
of
the
distinguished
foreigner
although
he
was
carefully
groomed
countess
löwenjoul
rode
a
big
cream
called
isabeau
she
had
an
excellent
seat
with
her
tall
straight
figure
but
she
held
her
small
head
in
its
huge
hat
on
one
side
and
her
lids
were
half
closed
and
twitched
klaus
heinrich
addressed
some
remarks
to
her
behind
miss
spoelmann
back
but
she
did
not
answer
and
went
riding
on
with
eyes
gazing
in
front
of
her
with
a
expression
and
imma
said
do
let
bother
the
countess
prince
her
thoughts
are
wandering
i
hope
he
said
that
the
countess
was
not
annoyed
at
having
to
come
with
us
and
he
was
distinctly
taken
aback
when
imma
spoelmann
answered
casually
to
tell
the
truth
she
very
likely
was
because
of
your
sums
he
asked
oh
the
sums
they
not
so
urgent
only
a
way
of
passing
the
time
although
i
hope
to
get
a
good
lot
of
useful
information
out
of
them
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
prince
that
the
countess
is
not
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
of
yourself
she
has
expressed
herself
to
that
effect
to
me
she
said
you
were
hard
and
stern
and
affected
her
like
a
cold
douche
klaus
heinrich
reddened
i
know
well
he
said
quietly
looking
down
at
his
reins
that
i
act
as
a
cordial
miss
spoelmann
or
at
any
rate
only
at
a
distance
that
too
is
inseparable
from
my
kind
of
existence
as
i
said
but
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
shown
myself
hard
and
stern
to
the
countess
probably
not
in
words
she
replied
but
you
did
not
allow
her
to
let
herself
go
you
did
not
do
her
the
kindness
of
letting
her
tongue
run
a
little
that
why
she
vexed
with
you
and
i
know
quite
well
what
you
did
how
you
embarrassed
the
poor
thing
and
gave
her
a
cold
douche
quite
well
she
repeated
and
turned
her
head
away
klaus
heinrich
did
not
answer
he
kept
his
left
hand
planted
on
his
hip
and
his
eyes
were
tired
then
he
said
you
know
quite
well
so
i
act
like
a
cold
douche
on
you
too
miss
spoelmann
do
i
i
warn
you
she
answered
at
once
in
her
broken
voice
and
wagging
her
head
from
side
to
side
on
no
account
to
overrate
the
effect
you
have
upon
me
prince
and
she
suddenly
set
fatma
off
at
a
gallop
and
flew
at
such
a
pace
over
the
fields
towards
the
dark
mass
of
the
distant
that
neither
the
countess
nor
klaus
heinrich
could
keep
up
with
her
not
till
she
reached
the
edge
of
the
wood
through
which
the
ran
did
she
halt
and
turn
her
horse
to
look
mockingly
at
her
followers
countess
löwenjoul
on
her
cream
was
the
first
to
come
up
with
the
runaway
then
came
florian
foaming
and
much
exhausted
by
his
unusual
exertion
they
all
laughed
and
their
breath
came
fast
as
they
entered
the
echoing
wood
the
countess
had
awakened
and
chatted
merrily
making
lively
graceful
gestures
and
showing
her
white
teeth
she
poked
fun
at
percival
whose
temper
had
again
been
excited
by
the
gallop
and
who
was
careering
wildly
among
the
trunks
in
front
of
the
horses
royal
highness
she
said
you
ought
to
see
him
jump
and
turn
somersaults
he
can
take
a
ditch
six
yards
broad
and
does
it
so
lightly
and
gracefully
you
be
delighted
but
only
of
his
own
accord
mind
you
of
his
free
will
for
i
believe
he
rather
let
himself
be
whipped
to
death
than
submit
to
any
training
or
teaching
of
tricks
he
is
one
might
say
his
own
trainer
by
nature
and
though
sometimes
unruly
he
is
never
rough
he
is
a
gentleman
an
aristocrat
and
full
of
character
he
as
proud
as
you
like
and
though
he
seems
mad
he
quite
able
to
control
himself
nobody
has
ever
heard
him
cry
for
pain
when
punished
and
hurt
he
only
eats
too
when
he
is
hungry
and
at
other
times
look
at
the
most
tempting
dainties
in
the
morning
he
has
cream
he
must
be
fed
he
wears
himself
out
he
quite
thin
under
his
glossy
coat
you
can
feel
all
his
ribs
for
i
afraid
he
never
grow
to
be
old
but
will
fall
an
early
victim
to
consumption
the
street
curs
persecute
him
they
go
for
him
in
every
street
but
he
jumps
clear
of
them
and
if
they
succeed
in
joining
issue
with
him
he
distributes
a
few
bites
with
his
splendid
teeth
which
the
rabble
do
forget
in
a
hurry
one
must
love
such
a
compound
of
chivalry
and
virtue
imma
agreed
in
words
which
were
the
most
serious
and
grave
which
klaus
heinrich
had
ever
heard
from
her
mouth
yes
she
said
you
a
good
friend
to
me
percy
i
shall
always
love
you
a
veterinary
surgeon
said
you
were
half
mad
and
advised
us
to
have
you
put
away
as
you
were
impossible
and
a
constant
danger
to
us
but
they
sha
take
my
percy
from
me
he
is
impossible
i
know
and
often
an
incumbrance
but
he
always
appealing
and
noble
and
i
love
him
dearly
the
countess
continued
to
talk
about
the
collie
nature
but
her
remarks
soon
became
disconnected
and
confused
and
lapsed
into
a
monologue
accompanied
by
lively
and
elegant
gestures
at
last
after
an
acid
look
at
klaus
heinrich
her
thoughts
again
began
to
wander
klaus
heinrich
felt
happy
and
cheered
whether
as
the
result
of
the
canter
for
which
he
had
had
to
brace
himself
up
for
though
a
decent
figure
on
a
horse
his
left
hand
prevented
him
from
being
a
strong
rider
or
for
some
other
reason
after
leaving
the
they
rode
along
the
quiet
between
meadows
and
furrowed
fields
with
a
peasant
hut
or
a
country
inn
here
and
there
as
they
drew
near
the
next
wood
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
wo
you
fulfil
your
promise
and
tell
me
about
the
countess
what
is
your
companion
history
she
is
my
friend
she
answered
and
in
a
sense
my
governess
too
although
she
did
not
come
to
us
till
i
was
grown
up
that
was
three
years
ago
in
new
york
and
the
countess
was
then
in
a
terrible
state
she
was
on
the
brink
of
starvation
said
miss
spoelmann
and
as
she
said
it
she
fastened
her
big
black
eyes
with
a
searching
startled
look
on
klaus
heinrich
really
starvation
he
asked
and
returned
her
look
do
please
go
on
yes
i
said
that
too
when
she
came
to
us
and
although
i
of
course
saw
quite
well
that
her
mind
was
slightly
affected
she
made
such
an
impression
upon
me
that
i
persuaded
my
father
to
let
her
be
my
companion
what
took
her
to
america
is
she
a
countess
by
birth
asked
klaus
heinrich
not
a
countess
but
of
noble
birth
brought
up
in
refined
and
luxurious
surroundings
sheltered
and
protected
as
she
expressed
it
to
me
from
every
wind
because
from
childhood
she
had
been
impressionable
and
sensitive
but
then
she
married
a
count
löwenjoul
a
cavalry
captain
a
strange
specimen
of
the
aristocracy
according
to
her
account
not
quite
up
to
the
mark
to
put
it
mildly
what
was
wrong
with
him
asked
klaus
heinrich
i
ca
exactly
tell
you
prince
you
must
take
into
consideration
the
rather
obscure
way
in
which
the
countess
puts
what
she
has
to
say
but
to
judge
from
what
she
has
told
me
he
must
have
been
just
about
as
arrant
a
scamp
as
one
could
well
imagine
a
regular
blackguard
i
see
said
klaus
heinrich
what
called
a
hard
case
or
a
tough
proposition
exactly
we
say
man
of
the
world
but
in
the
most
comprehensive
and
unlimited
sense
for
to
judge
by
the
countess
remarks
there
were
no
limits
in
his
case
no
that
what
i
too
gathered
said
klaus
heinrich
i
met
several
people
of
that
sort
regular
devils
so
to
speak
i
heard
of
one
such
who
used
to
make
love
in
his
motor
car
even
when
it
was
going
at
full
speed
did
your
friend
ueberbein
tell
you
of
him
no
somebody
else
ueberbein
would
not
think
it
proper
to
mention
anything
of
that
sort
to
me
then
he
must
be
a
useless
sort
of
friend
prince
you
think
better
of
him
when
i
tell
you
more
about
him
miss
spoelmann
but
please
go
on
well
i
do
know
whether
löwenjoul
behaved
like
your
roué
anyhow
he
behaved
disgracefully
i
expect
he
gambled
and
drank
i
guess
so
and
besides
that
of
course
he
made
love
neglected
the
countess
and
carried
on
with
the
loose
women
that
are
always
to
be
found
everywhere
at
first
behind
her
back
and
later
no
longer
behind
her
back
but
impudently
and
openly
without
any
regard
for
her
feelings
but
tell
me
why
did
she
ever
marry
him
she
married
him
against
her
parents
will
because
as
she
has
told
me
she
was
in
love
with
him
for
in
the
first
place
he
was
a
handsome
man
when
she
first
met
him
he
fell
off
in
his
looks
later
in
the
second
place
his
reputation
as
a
man
of
the
world
had
gone
before
him
and
that
according
to
her
constituted
a
sort
of
irresistible
attraction
for
her
for
though
she
had
been
so
well
sheltered
and
protected
nothing
would
shake
her
in
her
resolve
to
share
her
life
with
him
if
one
thinks
it
over
one
can
quite
understand
it
yes
he
said
i
can
quite
understand
it
she
wanted
to
have
her
fling
as
it
were
to
get
her
eyes
opened
and
she
saw
the
world
with
a
vengeance
you
may
put
it
like
that
if
you
like
though
the
expression
seems
to
me
rather
too
flippant
to
describe
her
experiences
her
husband
her
do
you
mean
that
he
beat
her
yes
he
her
physically
but
now
comes
something
prince
which
you
too
will
not
have
heard
about
before
she
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
her
not
only
in
a
temper
not
only
in
anger
and
rage
but
also
without
being
exasperated
simply
for
his
own
satisfaction
i
mean
that
his
caresses
were
so
revolting
as
to
amount
to
klaus
heinrich
was
silent
both
looked
very
grave
at
last
he
asked
did
the
countess
have
any
children
yes
two
they
died
quite
young
both
only
a
few
weeks
old
and
the
greatest
sorrow
the
countess
has
had
to
bear
it
would
seem
from
her
hints
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
loose
women
for
whom
her
husband
betrayed
her
that
the
children
died
directly
after
birth
both
remained
silent
and
their
eyes
clouded
over
add
to
that
continued
imma
spoelmann
that
he
dissipated
his
dowry
at
cards
and
with
women
a
respectable
dowry
it
was
too
and
after
her
parents
death
her
whole
fortune
also
relations
of
hers
too
helped
him
once
when
he
was
near
having
to
leave
the
service
on
account
of
his
debts
but
then
came
a
scandal
an
altogether
revolting
one
in
which
he
was
involved
and
which
did
for
him
once
and
for
all
what
was
it
asked
klaus
heinrich
i
ca
exactly
tell
you
prince
but
according
to
what
the
countess
has
let
slip
about
it
it
was
a
scandal
of
the
very
grossest
description
we
agreed
just
now
that
there
are
generally
no
limits
in
that
direction
and
then
he
went
to
america
you
right
there
prince
i
ca
help
admiring
your
please
go
on
miss
spoelmann
i
never
heard
anything
like
the
countess
story
no
more
had
i
so
you
can
imagine
what
an
impression
it
made
on
me
when
she
came
to
us
well
then
count
löwenjoul
bolted
to
america
with
the
police
at
his
heels
leaving
pretty
considerable
debts
behind
of
course
and
the
countess
went
with
him
she
went
with
him
why
because
she
still
loved
him
in
spite
of
everything
she
loves
him
still
and
because
she
was
determined
to
share
his
life
whatever
happened
he
took
her
with
him
though
because
he
had
a
better
chance
of
getting
help
from
her
relations
as
long
as
she
was
with
him
the
relations
sent
him
one
further
instalment
of
money
from
home
and
then
stopped
they
finally
buttoned
up
their
pockets
and
when
count
löwenjoul
saw
that
his
wife
was
no
more
use
to
him
he
just
left
her
left
her
in
absolute
destitution
and
cleared
out
i
knew
it
said
klaus
heinrich
i
expected
as
much
just
what
does
happen
but
imma
spoelmann
went
on
so
there
she
was
destitute
and
helpless
and
since
she
had
never
learned
to
earn
her
own
living
she
was
left
alone
to
face
want
and
hunger
and
you
must
remember
that
life
in
the
states
is
much
harder
and
meaner
than
here
in
your
country
also
that
the
countess
has
always
been
a
gentle
sensitive
creature
and
has
been
cruelly
treated
for
years
in
a
word
she
was
no
fit
subject
for
the
impressions
of
life
to
which
she
was
unceasingly
exposed
and
then
the
blessing
fell
to
her
what
blessing
she
told
me
about
that
too
what
was
the
blessing
miss
spoelmann
the
blessing
consisted
in
a
mental
disturbance
at
the
crisis
of
her
troubles
something
in
her
cracked
that
the
expression
she
used
to
me
so
that
she
no
longer
needed
to
face
life
and
to
bring
a
clear
sober
mind
to
bear
upon
it
but
was
permitted
so
to
speak
to
let
herself
go
to
relax
the
tension
of
her
nerves
and
to
drivel
when
she
liked
in
a
word
the
blessing
was
that
she
went
wrong
in
her
head
certainly
i
was
under
the
impression
said
klaus
heinrich
that
the
countess
was
letting
herself
go
when
she
drivelled
that
how
it
is
prince
she
is
quite
conscious
of
drivelling
and
often
laughs
as
she
does
so
or
lets
her
hearers
understand
that
she
does
mean
any
harm
by
it
her
strangeness
is
a
beneficent
disorder
which
she
can
control
to
a
certain
extent
and
which
she
allows
herself
to
indulge
in
it
is
if
you
prefer
it
a
want
of
of
said
klaus
heinrich
and
looked
down
at
his
reins
right
of
she
repeated
and
looked
at
him
you
seem
to
approve
of
that
want
prince
i
consider
as
a
general
rule
he
answered
quietly
that
it
is
not
right
to
let
oneself
go
and
to
make
oneself
at
home
but
that
should
always
be
exercised
whatever
the
circumstances
your
highness
doctrine
she
answered
is
a
praiseworthy
austerity
then
she
pouted
and
wagging
her
dark
head
in
its
hat
she
added
in
her
broken
voice
i
tell
you
something
highness
and
please
note
it
well
if
your
eminence
is
not
inclined
to
show
a
little
sympathy
and
indulgence
and
mildness
i
shall
have
to
decline
the
pleasure
of
your
distinguished
company
once
and
for
all
he
dropped
his
head
and
they
rode
a
while
in
silence
wo
you
go
on
to
tell
me
how
the
countess
came
to
you
he
asked
at
last
no
i
wo
she
said
and
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
but
he
pressed
her
so
pleadingly
that
she
finished
her
story
and
said
and
although
fifty
other
companions
applied
my
choice
for
the
choice
rested
with
me
fell
at
once
on
her
i
was
so
much
taken
with
her
at
my
first
interview
she
was
odd
i
could
see
that
but
she
was
odd
only
from
too
rich
an
experience
of
misery
and
wickedness
that
was
clear
in
every
word
she
said
and
as
for
me
i
had
always
been
a
little
lonely
and
cut
off
and
absolutely
without
experience
except
what
i
got
at
my
university
lectures
of
course
you
had
always
been
a
little
lonely
and
cut
off
repeated
klaus
heinrich
with
a
ring
of
joy
in
his
voice
that
what
i
said
it
was
a
dull
simple
life
in
some
ways
that
i
led
and
still
lead
because
it
has
not
altered
much
and
is
all
much
the
same
there
were
parties
with
and
balls
and
often
a
dash
in
a
closed
motor
to
the
opera
house
where
i
sat
in
one
of
the
little
boxes
above
the
stalls
so
as
to
be
well
observed
by
everybody
for
show
as
we
say
that
was
a
necessary
part
of
my
position
for
show
yes
for
show
i
mean
the
duty
of
showing
oneself
off
of
not
raising
walls
against
the
public
but
letting
them
come
into
the
garden
and
walk
on
the
lawn
and
gaze
at
the
terrace
watching
us
at
tea
my
father
spoelmann
disliked
it
intensely
but
it
was
a
necessary
consequence
of
our
position
what
did
you
usually
do
besides
miss
spoelmann
in
the
spring
we
went
to
our
house
in
the
adirondacks
and
in
the
summer
to
our
house
at
there
were
of
course
and
battles
of
flowers
and
tournaments
and
we
went
for
rides
and
drove
or
motored
and
the
people
stood
and
gaped
because
i
was
samuel
spoelmann
daughter
and
many
shouted
rude
remarks
after
me
rude
remarks
yes
and
they
probably
had
reason
to
at
any
rate
it
was
something
of
a
life
in
the
limelight
that
we
led
and
one
that
invited
discussion
and
between
whiles
he
said
you
played
in
the
breezes
did
you
or
rather
in
a
vacuum
where
no
dust
came
that
right
your
highness
is
pleased
to
mock
my
excess
of
candour
but
in
view
of
all
this
you
can
guess
how
extraordinarily
welcome
the
countess
was
to
me
when
she
came
to
see
me
in
fifth
avenue
she
does
not
express
herself
very
clearly
but
rather
in
a
mysterious
sort
of
way
and
the
boundary
line
at
which
she
begins
to
drivel
is
not
always
quite
clearly
apparent
but
that
only
strikes
me
as
right
and
instructive
as
it
gives
a
good
idea
of
the
boundlessness
of
misery
and
wickedness
in
the
world
you
envy
me
the
countess
do
you
envy
h
you
seem
to
assume
miss
spoelmann
that
i
have
never
had
my
eyes
opened
have
you
once
or
twice
maybe
for
instance
things
have
come
to
my
ears
about
our
lackeys
which
you
would
scarcely
dream
of
are
your
lackeys
so
bad
bad
that
what
they
are
for
one
thing
they
play
into
each
other
hands
and
scheme
and
take
bribes
from
the
tradesmen
but
prince
that
comparatively
harmless
yes
true
it
nothing
to
compare
with
the
way
the
countess
has
had
her
eyes
opened
they
broke
into
a
trot
and
leaving
at
the
the
gently
rising
and
falling
which
they
had
followed
through
the
turned
into
the
sandy
short
cut
between
high
banks
which
led
into
the
tufted
round
the
pheasantry
klaus
heinrich
was
at
home
in
these
parts
he
stretched
out
his
arm
the
right
one
to
point
out
everything
to
his
companions
though
there
was
not
much
worth
seeing
yonder
lay
the
schloss
closed
and
silent
with
its
and
its
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
on
one
side
was
the
pheasants
enclosure
which
gave
the
place
its
name
and
on
the
other
stavenüter
where
he
had
sometimes
sat
with
raoul
ueberbein
the
spring
sun
shone
mildly
over
the
damp
and
shed
a
soft
haze
over
the
distant
woods
they
reined
in
their
horses
in
front
of
the
and
imma
spoelmann
took
stock
of
the
prosaic
which
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
the
pheasantry
your
childhood
she
said
with
a
pout
does
not
seem
to
have
been
surrounded
by
much
giddy
splendour
no
he
laughed
there
nothing
to
see
in
the
schloss
it
the
same
inside
as
out
no
comparison
with
delphinenort
even
before
you
restored
it
let
put
our
horses
up
she
said
one
must
put
one
horses
up
on
an
expedition
must
one
countess
dismount
prince
i
thirsty
and
want
to
see
what
your
friend
stavenüter
has
got
to
drink
there
stood
herr
stavenüter
in
green
apron
and
stockings
bowing
and
pressing
his
knitted
cap
to
his
chest
with
both
hands
while
he
laughed
till
his
gums
showed
royal
highness
he
said
with
joy
in
his
voice
does
your
royal
highness
mean
to
honour
me
once
again
and
the
young
lady
he
added
with
a
tinge
of
deference
in
his
voice
for
he
knew
samuel
daughter
quite
well
and
there
had
been
in
the
whole
grand
duchy
no
more
eager
reader
of
the
newspaper
articles
which
coupled
prince
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
names
together
he
helped
the
countess
to
dismount
while
klaus
heinrich
who
was
the
first
to
the
ground
devoted
himself
to
miss
spoelmann
and
he
called
to
a
lad
who
with
the
spoelmanns
groom
took
charge
of
the
horses
then
followed
the
reception
and
welcome
to
which
klaus
heinrich
was
accustomed
he
addressed
a
few
formal
questions
in
a
reserved
tone
of
voice
to
herr
stavenüter
graciously
asked
how
he
was
and
how
his
business
prospered
and
received
the
answers
with
nods
and
a
show
of
real
interest
imma
spoelmann
watched
his
artificial
cold
demeanour
with
serious
searching
eyes
while
she
swung
her
backwards
and
forwards
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
remind
you
that
i
am
thirsty
she
said
at
last
sharply
and
decisively
whereupon
they
walked
into
the
garden
and
discussed
whether
they
need
go
in
to
the
klaus
heinrich
urged
that
it
was
still
so
damp
under
the
trees
but
imma
insisted
on
sitting
outside
and
herself
chose
one
of
the
long
narrow
tables
with
benches
on
each
side
which
herr
stavenüter
hastened
to
cover
with
a
white
cloth
lemonade
he
said
that
best
for
a
thirst
and
it
sound
stuff
no
trash
royal
highness
and
you
ladies
but
natural
juice
sweetened
there
no
better
followed
the
of
the
glass
balls
in
the
necks
of
the
bottles
and
while
his
distinguished
guests
tasted
the
drink
herr
stavenüter
dawdled
a
little
longer
at
the
table
meaning
to
serve
them
up
a
little
gossip
he
had
long
been
a
widower
and
his
three
children
who
in
days
gone
by
had
sung
here
under
the
trees
the
song
about
common
humanity
the
while
blowing
their
noses
with
their
fingers
had
now
left
him
the
son
was
a
soldier
in
the
capital
one
of
the
daughters
had
married
a
neighbouring
farmer
the
other
with
a
soul
for
higher
things
had
gone
into
service
in
the
capital
so
herr
stavenüter
was
in
solitary
control
in
this
remote
spot
in
the
capacity
of
farmer
of
the
schloss
lands
caretaker
of
the
schloss
and
head
keeper
of
the
pheasantry
and
was
well
content
with
his
lot
soon
if
the
weather
permitted
the
season
for
bicyclists
and
walkers
would
come
round
when
the
garden
was
filled
on
sundays
then
business
hummed
would
not
his
highness
and
the
ladies
like
to
take
a
peep
at
the
pheasantry
yes
they
would
later
so
herr
stavenüter
withdrew
for
the
present
after
placing
a
saucer
of
milk
for
percival
by
the
table
the
collie
had
been
in
some
muddy
water
on
the
way
and
looked
horrible
his
legs
were
thin
with
wet
and
the
white
parts
of
his
ragged
coat
covered
with
dirt
his
gaping
mouth
was
black
to
the
throat
from
nuzzling
for
and
his
dark
red
tongue
hung
dripping
out
of
his
mouth
he
quickly
lapped
up
his
milk
and
then
lay
with
panting
sides
by
his
mistress
feet
flat
on
his
side
his
head
thrown
back
in
an
attitude
of
repose
klaus
heinrich
declared
it
to
be
inexcusable
for
imma
to
expose
herself
after
her
ride
to
the
invidious
springtime
air
without
any
wrap
take
my
cloak
he
said
i
really
do
not
want
it
i
quite
warm
and
my
coat
is
padded
on
the
chest
she
would
not
hear
of
it
but
he
went
on
asking
her
so
insistently
that
she
consented
and
let
him
lay
his
grey
military
coat
with
a
major
round
her
shoulders
then
resting
her
dark
head
in
its
hat
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
she
watched
him
as
with
arm
outstretched
towards
the
schloss
he
described
to
her
the
life
he
had
once
led
there
there
where
the
tall
window
opened
on
to
the
ground
had
been
the
then
the
and
up
above
klaus
heinrich
room
with
the
plaster
torso
on
the
stove
he
told
her
too
about
professor
kürtchen
and
his
tactful
way
of
instructing
his
pupils
about
captain
widow
and
the
aristocratic
pheasants
who
called
everything
and
especially
about
raoul
ueberbein
his
friend
of
whom
imma
spoelmann
more
than
once
asked
him
to
tell
her
some
more
he
told
her
about
the
doctor
obscure
origin
and
about
the
money
his
parents
paid
to
be
quit
of
him
about
the
child
in
the
marsh
or
bog
and
the
medal
for
saving
life
about
ueberbein
plucky
and
ambitious
career
pursued
in
circumstances
calling
for
resolution
and
action
which
he
used
to
call
favourable
circumstances
and
about
his
friendship
with
doctor
sammet
whom
imma
knew
he
described
his
by
no
means
attractive
appearance
and
readily
owned
to
the
attraction
which
he
had
exercised
on
him
from
the
very
beginning
he
described
his
behaviour
towards
himself
klaus
heinrich
that
fatherly
and
jolly
blustering
camaraderie
which
had
distinguished
him
so
sharply
from
everybody
else
and
gave
imma
to
the
best
of
his
ability
an
insight
into
his
tutor
views
of
life
finally
he
expressed
his
concern
that
the
doctor
seemed
not
to
enjoy
any
sort
of
popularity
among
his
i
can
quite
believe
that
said
imma
he
was
surprised
and
asked
why
because
i
convinced
she
said
wagging
her
head
that
your
ueberbein
for
all
his
sparkling
conversation
is
an
unhappy
sort
of
creature
he
may
swagger
about
the
place
but
he
lacks
reserve
prince
and
that
means
that
he
will
come
to
a
bad
end
her
words
startled
klaus
heinrich
and
made
him
thoughtful
then
turning
to
the
countess
who
awoke
with
a
smile
out
of
a
brown
study
he
said
something
complimentary
about
her
riding
for
which
she
thanked
him
gracefully
he
said
that
anybody
could
see
that
she
had
learnt
to
ride
as
a
child
and
she
confessed
that
riding
lessons
had
formed
a
considerable
part
of
her
education
she
spoke
clearly
and
cheerfully
but
gradually
almost
imperceptibly
she
began
to
wander
into
a
strange
story
about
a
gallant
ride
which
she
had
made
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
last
manoeuvres
and
suddenly
started
talking
about
the
dreadful
wife
of
a
sergeant
in
the
grenadiers
who
had
come
into
her
room
the
previous
night
and
scratched
her
breasts
all
over
meanwhile
using
language
which
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
repeat
klaus
heinrich
asked
quietly
whether
she
had
not
shut
her
door
and
windows
of
course
but
anyone
could
break
the
glass
she
answered
hastily
and
turned
pale
in
one
cheek
and
red
in
the
other
klaus
heinrich
nodded
acquiescence
and
dropping
his
eyes
asked
her
quietly
to
let
him
call
her
frau
meier
now
and
then
a
proposal
which
she
gladly
accepted
with
a
confidential
smile
and
a
look
which
had
something
strangely
attractive
about
it
they
got
up
to
visit
the
pheasantry
after
klaus
heinrich
had
taken
back
his
cloak
and
as
they
left
the
garden
imma
spoelmann
said
well
done
prince
you
getting
on
a
commendation
which
made
him
blush
indeed
gave
him
far
more
pleasure
than
the
most
fulsome
newspaper
report
of
the
valuable
effect
of
his
appearance
at
a
ceremony
which
councillor
schustermann
could
ever
show
him
herr
stavenüter
escorted
his
guests
into
the
palisaded
enclosure
in
which
six
or
seven
families
of
pheasants
led
a
comfortable
petted
life
they
watched
the
greedy
and
birds
inspected
the
hatching
house
and
looked
on
while
herr
stavenüter
fed
the
pheasants
under
a
big
solitary
for
their
benefit
klaus
heinrich
thanked
him
warmly
for
all
that
he
had
shown
them
imma
spoelmann
regarding
him
the
while
with
her
big
searching
eyes
then
they
mounted
at
the
gate
of
the
and
rode
off
homewards
with
percival
barking
and
pirouetting
under
the
horses
noses
but
their
ride
home
was
destined
to
give
klaus
heinrich
in
the
course
of
his
conversation
with
imma
spoelmann
yet
another
significant
indication
of
her
real
nature
and
character
a
direct
revelation
of
certain
sides
of
her
personality
which
gave
him
food
for
much
thought
for
soon
after
they
had
left
the
and
joined
the
klaus
heinrich
reverted
to
a
subject
which
had
been
just
touched
on
at
his
first
visit
to
delphinenort
during
the
conversation
at
tea
and
had
not
ceased
to
exercise
him
ever
since
may
i
he
said
ask
you
one
question
miss
spoelmann
you
need
not
answer
it
if
you
do
want
to
i
see
about
that
she
answered
four
weeks
ago
he
began
when
i
first
had
the
pleasure
of
a
talk
with
your
father
spoelmann
i
asked
him
a
question
which
he
answered
so
curtly
and
abruptly
that
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
my
question
had
been
indiscreet
or
a
false
step
what
was
it
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
not
found
it
hard
to
leave
america
there
you
are
prince
there
another
question
which
is
worthy
of
you
a
typical
if
you
had
had
a
little
more
training
in
the
use
of
your
reasoning
powers
you
would
have
known
without
asking
that
if
my
father
had
not
been
ready
and
glad
to
leave
america
he
most
assuredly
would
not
have
left
it
very
probably
you
are
right
forgive
me
i
do
think
enough
but
if
my
question
was
nothing
worse
than
a
want
of
thought
i
shall
be
quite
content
can
you
assure
me
that
that
is
the
case
no
prince
i
afraid
i
can
not
she
said
and
looked
at
him
suddenly
with
her
big
black
eyes
then
what
has
want
of
thought
to
do
with
it
do
please
explain
i
ask
you
in
the
name
of
our
friendship
are
we
friends
i
hoped
so
he
said
pleadingly
well
well
patience
i
did
know
it
but
i
quite
ready
to
learn
it
but
to
return
to
my
father
he
really
did
lose
his
temper
at
your
question
he
has
a
quick
temper
and
has
plenty
of
occasion
to
practise
losing
it
the
fact
is
that
public
opinion
and
sentiment
were
not
to
us
in
america
there
such
a
lot
of
scheming
over
there
i
may
mention
that
i
am
not
posted
in
the
details
but
there
was
a
strong
political
movement
towards
setting
the
crowd
the
common
people
you
know
against
us
the
result
was
legislation
and
restrictions
which
made
my
father
life
over
there
a
burden
to
him
you
know
of
course
prince
that
it
was
not
he
who
made
us
what
we
are
but
my
redoubtable
grandfather
with
his
paradise
nugget
and
blockhead
farm
my
father
could
not
help
it
he
was
born
to
his
destiny
and
it
was
no
gratification
to
him
because
he
is
naturally
shy
and
sensitive
and
would
much
have
preferred
to
have
lived
for
playing
the
organ
and
collecting
glass
i
really
believe
that
the
hatred
which
was
the
result
of
the
scheming
against
us
so
that
sometimes
the
people
hurled
abuse
after
me
when
i
motored
past
them
that
the
hatred
quite
probably
brought
on
his
stone
in
the
kidneys
it
more
than
possible
i
am
cordially
attached
to
your
father
said
klaus
heinrich
with
emphasis
i
should
have
made
that
prince
a
condition
of
our
becoming
friends
but
there
was
another
point
which
made
things
worse
and
made
our
position
over
there
still
more
difficult
and
that
was
our
origin
your
origin
yes
prince
we
are
no
aristocratic
pheasants
unfortunately
we
are
not
descended
from
washington
or
from
the
pilgrim
fathers
no
for
you
are
german
oh
yes
but
there
something
besides
to
get
over
please
look
at
me
closely
does
it
strike
you
that
there
is
anything
to
be
proud
of
in
having
wispy
hair
like
mine
that
always
falling
where
not
wanted
goodness
knows
miss
spoelmann
you
got
glorious
hair
said
klaus
heinrich
i
know
that
you
are
partly
of
southern
extraction
for
read
somewhere
that
your
grandfather
married
in
bolivia
or
thereabouts
he
did
but
that
where
the
trouble
lies
prince
i
a
quintroon
a
what
a
quintroon
that
goes
with
the
adirondacks
and
the
refraction
miss
spoelmann
i
do
know
what
it
is
i
already
told
you
that
i
do
know
much
well
it
a
fact
my
grandfather
thoughtless
as
he
always
was
married
a
woman
of
indian
blood
down
south
indian
blood
yes
she
was
of
indian
stock
at
the
third
remove
daughter
of
a
white
and
a
and
so
a
terceroon
as
it
is
called
she
must
have
been
wonderfully
beautiful
and
she
was
my
grandmother
the
grandchildren
of
a
terceroon
are
called
quintroons
that
how
things
are
most
interesting
but
did
you
say
that
it
had
affected
attitude
towards
you
you
do
understand
prince
i
must
tell
you
that
indian
blood
over
there
means
a
heavy
blot
such
a
blot
that
friendships
and
affections
are
transformed
into
hatred
and
abuse
if
proof
of
descent
comes
to
light
of
course
things
are
not
so
serious
with
us
for
with
quadroons
why
of
course
the
taint
is
nothing
like
so
great
and
a
quintroon
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
untainted
but
in
our
case
exposed
to
gossip
as
we
were
it
was
naturally
different
and
several
times
when
the
people
shouted
abuse
after
us
i
heard
them
say
that
i
was
a
coloured
girl
in
short
my
descent
was
made
an
excuse
for
insults
and
annoyances
and
raised
a
barrier
between
us
and
the
few
who
were
in
the
same
position
of
life
as
ourselves
there
was
always
something
which
we
had
to
hide
or
to
brazen
out
my
grandfather
had
brazened
it
out
he
was
that
sort
of
man
and
knew
what
he
was
doing
besides
his
blood
was
pure
it
was
only
his
beautiful
wife
who
had
the
taint
but
my
father
was
her
son
and
sensitive
and
as
he
is
he
has
always
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
resented
being
stared
at
and
hated
and
despised
at
the
same
time
half
a
world
wonder
and
half
a
monument
of
iniquity
as
he
used
to
say
he
was
fed
up
with
america
that
the
whole
history
prince
said
imma
spoelmann
and
now
you
know
why
my
father
lost
his
temper
over
your
pointed
question
klaus
heinrich
thanked
her
for
the
explanation
indeed
as
he
saluted
and
took
leave
it
was
lunch
time
of
the
ladies
in
front
of
the
delphinenort
gate
he
repeated
his
thanks
for
what
he
had
been
told
and
then
rode
at
foot
pace
home
pondering
over
the
events
of
the
morning
he
saw
imma
spoelmann
sitting
in
a
languid
pose
in
her
dress
at
the
table
with
a
look
as
of
a
spoilt
child
on
her
face
sitting
in
comfortable
assurance
and
uttering
remarks
with
a
sting
in
them
such
as
were
good
coin
in
the
united
states
where
clearness
hardness
and
a
ready
wit
were
essentials
of
life
and
why
klaus
heinrich
could
understand
now
and
never
a
day
passed
that
he
did
not
try
to
realize
it
better
stared
at
hated
and
despised
at
the
same
time
half
a
wonder
and
half
a
monument
of
iniquity
that
what
her
life
had
been
and
that
had
instilled
the
poison
into
her
remarks
that
acidity
and
mocking
directness
which
looked
like
offence
but
really
were
defence
and
which
evoked
a
look
of
bewilderment
on
the
faces
of
those
who
had
never
had
any
occasion
for
the
weapons
of
wit
she
had
demanded
of
him
sympathy
and
tenderness
towards
the
poor
countess
when
she
let
herself
go
but
she
herself
had
a
claim
to
sympathy
and
tenderness
for
she
was
lonely
and
her
life
like
his
was
a
hard
one
at
the
same
time
a
memory
haunted
him
a
painful
memory
whose
scene
was
the
refreshment
room
of
the
citizen
garden
and
which
ended
in
a
tureen
lid
little
sister
he
said
to
himself
as
he
quickly
dismissed
the
scene
from
his
thoughts
little
sister
but
most
of
all
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
planning
how
soonest
to
enjoy
miss
spoelmann
society
again
he
enjoyed
it
soon
and
often
in
all
sorts
of
circumstances
february
gave
place
to
threatening
march
fickle
april
and
soft
may
and
all
these
months
klaus
heinrich
visited
schloss
delphinenort
at
least
once
a
week
in
the
morning
or
in
the
afternoon
and
always
in
the
irresponsible
mood
in
which
he
had
presented
himself
at
the
that
february
morning
as
if
led
by
fate
without
any
action
of
his
own
will
the
proximity
of
the
schlosses
made
the
visits
easy
the
short
distance
through
the
park
from
the
hermitage
to
delphinenort
was
easily
crossed
on
horseback
or
in
a
dogcart
without
exciting
much
attention
and
when
the
advancing
season
brought
more
people
to
the
neighbourhood
and
made
it
harder
and
harder
for
them
to
go
for
rides
without
attracting
public
attention
the
prince
had
by
this
time
reached
a
state
of
mind
which
can
only
be
described
as
complete
indifference
and
blind
recklessness
towards
the
world
the
court
the
capital
and
the
countryside
it
was
not
till
later
that
the
public
interest
began
to
play
a
really
important
and
encouraging
part
in
his
thoughts
and
actions
he
had
not
taken
leave
of
the
ladies
after
the
first
ride
without
suggesting
another
expedition
a
suggestion
to
which
imma
spoelmann
pouting
and
wagging
her
head
from
side
to
side
had
failed
to
bring
any
serious
objection
so
he
came
again
and
they
rode
to
the
royal
kennels
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
gardens
on
the
third
occasion
they
chose
a
third
place
to
ride
to
which
also
they
could
reach
without
going
near
the
town
then
when
spring
enticed
the
townspeople
into
the
open
air
and
the
filled
up
they
preferred
an
path
which
really
was
no
path
but
a
richly
wooded
dyke
which
stretched
far
away
to
the
north
along
a
stream
the
quietest
way
of
reaching
it
was
by
riding
out
at
the
back
of
the
hermitage
park
and
past
the
river
meadows
on
the
edge
of
the
northern
town
garden
up
to
the
royal
kennels
then
not
crossing
the
river
by
the
wooden
bridge
at
the
weir
but
keeping
along
this
side
the
kennels
farm
was
left
behind
on
the
right
and
the
ride
went
on
through
the
on
the
left
lay
spreading
meadows
white
and
gaily
coloured
with
hemlock
and
anemones
buttercups
and
bluebells
clover
daisies
and
a
village
church
tower
rose
in
front
of
them
beyond
the
and
the
busy
lay
far
away
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
riders
farther
on
the
meadows
with
their
came
close
up
to
the
plantations
on
the
left
shutting
out
the
view
and
enabling
them
to
ride
in
complete
seclusion
generally
side
by
side
with
the
countess
behind
as
the
path
was
narrow
they
talked
or
rode
in
silence
while
percival
jumped
over
the
stream
and
back
again
or
plunged
into
it
for
a
bath
or
a
hurried
drink
they
came
back
the
same
way
as
they
went
when
however
the
quicksilver
fell
owing
to
the
lowness
of
the
atmospheric
pressure
when
rain
followed
and
klaus
heinrich
nevertheless
felt
another
peep
at
imma
spoelmann
to
be
a
necessity
he
presented
himself
in
his
dogcart
at
delphinenort
at
tea
time
and
they
stayed
indoors
spoelmann
joined
them
at
tea
not
more
than
two
or
three
times
his
malady
got
worse
about
this
time
and
on
several
days
he
was
obliged
to
stay
in
bed
with
hot
poultices
when
he
did
come
he
used
to
say
hullo
young
prince
with
his
thin
hand
dip
a
rusk
in
his
tea
throw
in
a
cross
word
here
and
there
into
the
conversation
and
end
by
offering
his
guest
his
gold
whereupon
he
left
the
garden
room
with
watercloose
who
had
sat
silent
and
smiling
at
the
table
in
fine
weather
too
they
sometimes
preferred
not
to
go
outside
the
park
but
to
play
lawn
tennis
on
the
trim
lawn
below
the
terrace
on
one
occasion
they
went
for
a
rapid
drive
in
spoelmann
motor
far
out
beyond
the
pheasantry
one
day
klaus
heinrich
asked
is
what
i
have
read
true
miss
spoelmann
that
your
father
gets
such
a
tremendous
lot
of
letters
and
appeals
every
day
then
she
described
to
him
subscription
lists
which
kept
pouring
in
to
delphinenort
and
which
were
dealt
with
as
thoroughly
as
was
practicable
of
the
piles
of
begging
letters
by
every
post
from
europe
and
america
which
phlebs
and
slippers
ran
through
and
weeded
out
for
submission
to
spoelmann
sometimes
she
said
she
amused
herself
by
glancing
through
the
heaps
and
reading
the
addresses
for
these
were
often
quite
fantastic
for
the
needy
or
speculative
senders
tried
to
outdo
each
other
in
the
deference
and
servility
of
their
address
on
the
envelopes
and
every
conceivable
title
and
distinction
could
be
found
mixed
up
in
the
strangest
way
on
the
letters
but
one
writer
had
quite
recently
carried
off
the
prize
by
addressing
his
envelope
to
his
royal
highness
samuel
spoelmann
but
it
did
not
get
him
any
more
than
the
others
on
other
occasions
the
prince
fell
to
talking
mysteriously
about
the
owl
chamber
in
the
old
schloss
and
confided
to
her
that
recently
noises
had
again
been
heard
in
it
pointing
to
events
of
moment
in
his
klaus
heinrich
family
then
imma
spoelmann
laughed
and
pouting
and
wagging
her
head
from
side
to
side
gave
him
a
scientific
explanation
of
the
noises
just
as
she
had
done
in
connexion
with
the
secrets
of
the
barometer
nonsense
she
said
it
must
be
that
that
part
of
the
was
ellipsoidal
and
a
second
ellipsoidal
surface
with
the
same
curvature
and
with
a
at
the
focus
existed
somewhere
outside
the
result
being
that
inside
the
haunted
room
noises
were
audible
which
could
not
be
distinguished
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
klaus
heinrich
was
rather
crestfallen
over
this
explanation
and
loath
to
give
up
the
common
belief
in
the
connexion
between
the
and
the
fortunes
of
his
house
thus
they
conversed
and
the
countess
too
took
part
now
sensible
now
confused
klaus
heinrich
took
considerable
pains
not
to
rebuff
or
chill
her
by
his
manner
and
addressed
her
as
frau
meier
whenever
she
appeared
to
think
it
necessary
for
her
protection
against
the
plots
of
the
wicked
women
he
recounted
to
the
ladies
his
unreal
life
the
gala
suppers
at
the
students
clubs
the
military
banquets
and
his
educational
tour
he
told
them
about
his
relations
about
his
mother
whom
he
visited
now
and
then
in
the
segenhaus
where
she
kept
dismal
court
and
about
albrecht
and
ditlinde
imma
spoelmann
in
her
turn
related
some
incidents
in
her
luxurious
and
singular
youth
and
the
countess
often
slipped
in
a
few
dark
sayings
about
the
horrors
and
secrets
of
life
to
which
the
others
listened
with
serious
and
thoughtful
faces
they
took
special
delight
in
one
kind
of
game
guessing
existences
making
estimates
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
of
the
people
they
happened
to
see
in
the
citizen
world
a
strange
and
curious
study
of
the
from
a
distant
standpoint
from
the
terrace
or
from
horseback
what
kind
of
young
people
might
these
be
what
did
they
do
where
did
they
come
from
they
were
certainly
not
apprentices
perhaps
technical
students
or
budding
foresters
to
judge
by
certain
signs
maybe
they
belonged
to
the
agricultural
college
at
any
rate
stout
fellows
enough
though
rather
rough
with
sound
careers
before
them
but
that
little
untidy
thing
who
strolled
past
looked
like
a
factory
hand
or
dressmaker
assistant
girls
like
her
always
had
a
young
man
in
their
own
class
who
took
them
out
to
tea
in
the
parks
on
sundays
and
they
exchanged
what
they
knew
about
people
in
general
discussed
them
like
connoisseurs
and
felt
that
this
pastime
brought
them
closer
together
than
any
amount
of
riding
or
lawn
tennis
as
for
the
motor
drive
imma
spoelmann
in
the
course
of
it
explained
that
she
had
only
invited
klaus
heinrich
to
it
so
as
to
let
him
see
the
chauffeur
a
young
american
in
brown
leather
who
she
declared
resembled
the
prince
klaus
heinrich
objected
with
a
smile
that
the
back
of
the
driver
neck
did
not
enable
him
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
matter
and
asked
the
countess
to
say
what
she
thought
she
after
long
denying
the
likeness
in
polite
embarrassment
at
last
on
insistence
with
a
side
glance
at
klaus
heinrich
agreed
to
it
then
miss
spoelmann
said
that
the
grave
sober
and
skilful
youth
had
originally
been
in
her
father
personal
service
driving
him
daily
from
fifth
avenue
to
broadway
and
back
spoelmann
however
had
insisted
on
extraordinary
speed
like
that
of
an
express
train
and
the
intense
strain
put
upon
a
driver
by
such
speed
in
the
crowded
streets
of
new
york
had
proved
at
last
too
much
for
the
youth
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
accident
had
happened
the
young
man
had
stuck
to
it
and
done
his
deadly
duty
with
amazing
care
but
in
the
end
it
had
often
happened
that
he
had
to
be
lifted
down
in
a
faint
from
his
seat
at
the
end
of
a
run
a
proof
of
the
inordinate
strain
to
which
he
had
been
daily
subjected
to
avoid
having
to
dismiss
him
spoelmann
had
made
him
his
daughter
special
chauffeur
and
he
had
continued
to
act
in
that
capacity
in
their
new
abode
imma
had
noticed
the
likeness
between
klaus
heinrich
and
him
the
first
time
she
saw
the
prince
it
was
of
course
a
similarity
not
of
features
but
of
expression
the
countess
had
agreed
with
her
klaus
heinrich
said
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
object
to
the
likeness
as
the
heroic
young
man
had
all
his
sympathy
they
then
discussed
further
the
difficult
and
anxious
life
of
a
chauffeur
without
countess
löwenjoul
taking
any
further
part
in
the
conversation
she
did
not
prattle
during
this
drive
though
later
she
made
a
few
sensible
and
pointed
remarks
for
the
rest
spoelmann
craze
for
speed
seemed
to
have
descended
in
some
measure
to
his
daughter
for
she
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
repeating
the
wild
gallop
she
had
started
on
their
first
ride
and
as
klaus
heinrich
stimulated
by
her
gibes
urged
the
amazed
and
disapproving
florian
to
the
top
of
his
speed
so
as
not
to
be
left
behind
the
gallop
always
degenerated
into
a
race
which
imma
spoelmann
always
started
at
unexpected
and
arbitrary
moments
several
of
these
struggles
took
place
on
the
lonely
causeway
and
one
in
particular
was
long
and
bitter
it
happened
after
a
short
talk
about
klaus
heinrich
popularity
which
was
begun
brusquely
and
broken
off
as
brusquely
by
imma
spoelmann
she
asked
suddenly
is
it
true
what
i
hear
prince
that
you
are
so
tremendously
popular
with
the
people
that
you
have
won
all
their
hearts
he
answered
so
they
say
it
must
be
some
characteristics
not
necessarily
good
ones
what
more
i
not
sure
whether
i
believe
it
or
even
ought
to
be
glad
of
it
i
doubt
whether
it
speaks
for
me
my
brother
the
grand
duke
declares
in
so
many
words
that
popularity
is
h
the
grand
duke
must
be
a
fine
man
i
got
a
great
respect
for
him
so
we
see
you
in
an
atmosphere
of
adulation
and
everybody
loves
you
go
on
she
cried
suddenly
and
gave
fatma
a
cut
with
her
white
switch
the
mare
started
and
the
race
began
it
lasted
a
long
time
never
before
had
they
followed
the
stream
so
far
the
view
on
the
left
had
long
become
shut
in
lumps
of
earth
and
grass
flew
from
under
the
horses
hoofs
the
countess
had
soon
dropped
behind
when
at
last
they
reined
in
their
horses
florian
was
trembling
with
exhaustion
and
the
riders
themselves
were
pale
and
panting
they
rode
back
in
silence
klaus
heinrich
received
a
visit
at
the
hermitage
from
raoul
ueberbein
the
afternoon
before
his
birthday
this
year
the
doctor
came
to
wish
him
many
happy
returns
as
he
expected
to
be
prevented
by
his
work
from
doing
so
on
the
morrow
they
strolled
round
the
gravel
path
at
the
back
of
the
park
the
tutor
in
his
and
white
tie
klaus
heinrich
in
his
summer
coat
the
grass
stood
ready
for
cutting
under
the
perpendicular
rays
of
the
midday
sun
and
the
limes
were
in
flower
in
one
corner
close
by
the
hedge
which
divided
the
park
from
the
unlovely
suburbs
stood
a
little
rustic
temple
klaus
heinrich
was
telling
of
his
visits
to
delphinenort
as
this
topic
lay
nearest
his
heart
he
spoke
quite
clearly
about
them
but
did
not
tell
the
doctor
any
actual
news
for
the
latter
showed
that
he
knew
all
about
them
how
was
that
oh
from
various
sources
ueberbein
had
never
started
the
subject
so
people
in
the
town
concern
themselves
about
it
heaven
forbid
klaus
heinrich
that
anybody
should
give
a
thought
to
it
either
to
the
rides
or
to
the
teas
or
to
the
motor
drive
you
do
suppose
that
that
sort
of
thing
is
expected
to
set
tongues
wagging
but
we
so
careful
is
rich
klaus
heinrich
and
so
is
the
carefulness
all
the
same
his
excellency

knobelsdorff
keeps
himself
accurately
posted
in
all
your
knobelsdorff
knobelsdorff
klaus
heinrich
was
silent
then
asked
and
what
is
baron
attitude
towards
what
he
learns
well
the
old
gentleman
has
yet
had
a
chance
of
interfering
in
the
developments
but
the
public
opinion
the
people
the
people
of
course
hold
their
breath
and
you
you
yourself
my
dear
doctor
ueberbein
i
waiting
for
the
answered
the
doctor
no
cried
klaus
heinrich
joyfully
no
there
be
no
this
time
doctor
ueberbein
for
i
am
happy
oh
so
happy
whatever
happens
can
you
understand
you
taught
me
that
happiness
was
no
concern
of
mine
and
you
pulled
me
up
short
when
i
tried
to
come
by
it
and
right
thankful
i
was
to
you
for
doing
so
for
it
was
horrible
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
but
this
is
no
case
of
high
jinks
at
a
dance
which
leave
one
humiliated
and
heavy
at
heart
this
is
no
breaking
out
and
running
off
the
rails
and
humiliation
for
ca
you
see
that
she
of
whom
we
are
speaking
belongs
neither
to
the
dance
nor
to
the
aristocratic
nor
to
anything
in
the
world
but
to
me
that
she
is
a
princess
doctor
ueberbein
and
as
good
as
me
and
there
can
be
no
question
here
of
a
you
have
taught
me
that
it
is
silly
to
maintain
that
we
all
only
ordinary
men
and
hopeless
for
me
to
act
as
if
we
were
and
that
the
happiness
i
would
gain
by
doing
so
is
forbidden
to
me
and
must
bring
me
to
shame
in
the
end
but
this
is
not
that
silly
and
forbidden
happiness
it
is
my
first
taste
of
the
happiness
which
is
allowed
me
and
which
i
may
hope
for
doctor
ueberbein
and
yield
myself
to
without
misgiving
whatever
comes
of
it
prince
klaus
heinrich
said
doctor
ueberbein
though
he
did
not
at
once
leave
him
but
continued
walking
at
his
side
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
red
beard
sunk
on
his
breast
no
said
klaus
heinrich
no
not
doctor
ueberbein
just
it
i
mean
to
remain
your
friend
you
who
have
had
such
a
hard
time
and
have
shown
such
pride
in
your
duty
and
destiny
and
have
made
me
proud
too
in
treating
me
as
a
companion
i
have
no
intention
of
resting
on
my
oars
now
that
i
have
found
happiness
but
will
remain
true
to
you
and
to
myself
and
to
my
exalted
calling
it
can
not
be
said
doctor
ueberbein
in
latin
and
shook
his
ugly
head
with
its
protruding
pointed
ears
it
can
be
doctor
i
sure
it
can
they
not
incompatible
and
you
you
ought
not
to
show
yourself
so
cold
and
distant
at
my
side
when
i
am
so
happy
and
what
more
it
the
eve
of
my
birthday
tell
me
had
so
many
experiences
and
seen
so
much
of
the
world
in
all
its
aspects
have
you
never
had
any
experiences
in
this
direction
you
know
what
i
mean
have
you
never
had
an
attack
like
this
of
mine
h
said
doctor
ueberbein
and
pressed
his
lips
together
till
his
red
beard
rose
and
the
muscles
knotted
in
his
cheeks
no
doubt
i
may
have
had
one
once
i
thought
so
tell
me
about
it
doctor
ueberbein
you
must
tell
me
about
it
the
hour
was
one
of
quiet
sunshine
and
the
air
full
of
the
scent
of
limes
so
doctor
ueberbein
related
an
incident
in
his
career
on
which
he
had
never
touched
in
previous
accounts
though
it
had
perhaps
a
decisive
influence
on
his
whole
life
it
had
occurred
in
those
early
days
when
the
doctor
was
teacher
of
the
young
idea
and
at
the
same
time
working
on
his
own
account
when
he
used
to
draw
in
his
and
give
private
lessons
to
sleek
tradesmen
children
so
as
to
get
money
to
buy
books
with
with
his
hands
still
behind
him
and
his
beard
sunk
on
his
breast
the
doctor
related
the
incident
in
a
sharp
and
incisive
tone
of
voice
pressing
his
lips
close
together
between
each
sentence
at
that
date
fate
had
forged
the
closest
ties
between
him
and
a
woman
a
lovely
fair
lady
who
was
the
wife
of
an
honourable
and
respected
man
and
the
mother
of
three
children
he
had
entered
the
family
as
tutor
to
the
children
but
had
subsequently
been
a
constant
guest
and
visitor
and
with
the
husband
too
had
reached
a
footing
of
mutual
confidences
the
feelings
of
the
young
tutor
and
the
fair
wife
for
each
other
had
been
long
unsuspected
and
longer
still
unexpressed
in
words
but
they
grew
stronger
in
the
silence
and
more
overpowering
till
one
evening
hour
when
the
husband
had
stayed
late
at
his
office
a
warm
sweet
dangerous
hour
they
burst
into
flames
and
were
near
to
overwhelm
them
in
that
hour
their
longing
had
cried
aloud
for
the
happiness
the
tremendous
happiness
of
their
union
but
said
doctor
ueberbein
the
world
could
sometimes
show
a
noble
action
they
felt
ashamed
he
said
to
tread
the
mean
and
ridiculous
path
of
treachery
and
to
clap
horns
as
the
phrase
goes
on
the
honest
husband
while
to
spoil
his
life
by
demanding
release
from
him
as
the
right
of
passion
was
equally
not
to
their
taste
in
short
for
the
children
sake
and
for
that
of
the
good
honest
husband
whom
they
both
respected
they
denied
themselves
yes
that
what
happened
but
of
course
it
needed
a
good
deal
of
stern
resolution
ueberbein
continued
to
visit
the
fair
lady
house
occasionally
he
would
sup
there
when
he
had
time
play
a
game
of
cards
with
his
two
friends
kiss
his
hostess
hand
and
say
good
night
but
when
he
had
told
the
prince
this
much
he
concluded
in
a
still
shorter
and
sharper
tone
than
he
had
begun
and
the
balls
of
muscle
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
showed
more
prominently
than
before
for
the
hour
which
saw
their
act
of
renunciation
in
that
hour
ueberbein
had
said
a
final
farewell
to
all
happiness
dalliance
with
happiness
as
he
had
since
called
it
as
he
failed
or
refused
to
win
the
fair
lady
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
honour
her
and
the
bonds
which
bound
him
to
her
by
achieving
something
and
making
himself
felt
in
the
field
of
hard
work
to
this
he
had
dedicated
his
life
to
this
alone
and
it
had
brought
him
to
what
he
was
that
was
the
secret
or
at
least
a
contribution
of
the
riddle
of
ueberbein
unsociability
unapproachableness
and
earnest
endeavour
klaus
heinrich
was
quite
frightened
to
see
how
unusually
green
his
face
was
when
he
took
his
leave
with
a
deep
bow
saying
my
greetings
to
little
imma
klaus
heinrich
next
day
the
prince
received
the
congratulations
of
the
staff
at
the
schloss
and
later
those
of
herr
von
and
von
in
the
yellow
room
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
members
of
the
grand
ducal
house
came
to
the
hermitage
to
pay
their
respects
and
at
one
klaus
heinrich
drove
to
luncheon
with
prince
and
princess
zu
meeting
with
an
unusually
warm
reception
from
the
public
on
the
way
the
grimmburgers
were
mustered
in
full
force
in
the
pretty
palace
in
the
albrechtstrasse
the
grand
duke
too
came
in
a
nodded
his
small
head
to
each
member
of
the
party
sucking
his
lower
lip
against
his
upper
the
while
and
drank
during
lunch
almost
immediately
after
lunch
was
finished
he
withdrew
prince
lambert
had
come
without
his
wife
the
old
habitué
of
the
ballet
was
painted
and
slovenly
and
his
voice
sounded
sepulchral
he
was
to
some
extent
ignored
by
his
relations
during
luncheon
the
conversation
turned
for
a
while
on
court
matters
then
on
little
princess
philippine
progress
and
later
almost
exclusively
on
prince
philipp
commercial
schemes
the
quiet
little
man
talked
about
his
breweries
factories
and
mills
and
in
particular
about
his
he
described
various
improvements
in
the
machinery
quoted
figures
of
capital
invested
and
returns
and
his
cheeks
glowed
while
his
wife
relations
listened
to
him
with
looks
of
curiosity
approval
or
mockery
when
coffee
had
been
served
in
the
big
the
princess
holding
her
gilded
cup
went
up
to
her
brother
and
said
you
have
quite
deserted
us
lately
klaus
heinrich
ditlinde
face
with
the
grimmburg
was
not
so
transparent
as
it
had
once
been
it
had
gained
more
colour
since
the
birth
of
her
daughter
and
her
head
seemed
to
be
less
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
her
fair
hair
have
i
deserted
you
he
said
forgive
me
ditlinde
perhaps
i
have
but
there
were
so
many
calls
on
my
time
and
i
knew
that
there
were
on
yours
too
for
you
are
no
longer
confined
to
flowers
true
the
flowers
have
had
to
take
a
less
prominent
place
they
get
much
thought
from
me
now
a
fairer
life
and
flowering
now
occupies
all
my
time
i
believe
that
where
i
have
got
my
red
cheeks
from
like
dear
philipp
from
his
peat
he
ought
not
to
have
talked
about
it
the
whole
of
luncheon
as
he
did
but
it
his
hobby
and
it
is
because
i
was
so
busy
and
rushed
that
i
was
not
cross
with
you
for
never
showing
yourself
and
for
going
your
own
way
even
though
that
way
seemed
to
me
rather
a
surprising
one
do
you
know
what
it
is
ditlinde
yes
though
unfortunately
not
from
you
but
jettchen
isenschnibbe
has
kept
me
well
posted
you
know
she
is
always
a
fund
of
news
and
at
first
i
was
horribly
shocked
i
do
deny
it
but
after
all
they
live
in
delphinenort
he
has
a
private
physician
and
philipp
thinks
they
are
in
their
way
of
equal
birth
with
ourselves
i
believe
i
once
spoke
disparagingly
about
them
klaus
heinrich
i
said
something
about
a
croesus
if
i
remember
rightly
and
made
a
pun
on
the
word
but
if
you
consider
them
worthy
of
your
friendship
i
been
wrong
and
of
course
withdraw
my
remarks
and
will
try
to
think
differently
about
them
in
future
i
promise
you
you
always
loved
rummaging
she
went
on
after
he
had
laughed
and
kissed
her
hand
and
i
had
to
do
it
with
you
and
my
dress
do
you
remember
it
the
red
velvet
suffered
for
it
now
you
have
to
rummage
alone
and
god
grant
klaus
heinrich
that
it
bring
you
any
horrible
experience
i
really
believe
ditlinde
that
every
experience
is
fine
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
but
my
present
experience
is
splendid
at
five
the
prince
left
the
hermitage
again
in
his
dogcart
which
he
drove
himself
with
a
groom
at
his
back
it
was
warm
and
klaus
heinrich
was
wearing
white
trousers
with
a
coat
bowing
he
again
drove
to
the
town
or
more
precisely
to
the
old
schloss
he
did
not
enter
the
albrechtstor
however
but
drove
in
through
a
side
door
and
across
two
courtyards
till
he
reached
that
in
which
the
grew
here
all
was
still
and
stony
the
with
their
oblique
windows
balustrades
and
fine
carvings
towered
in
the
corners
the
building
stood
there
in
light
and
shadow
partly
grey
and
partly
more
with
gables
and
projections
with
open
porticoes
and
peeps
through
broad
into
vaulted
halls
and
narrow
galleries
but
in
the
middle
in
its
unfenced
bed
stood
the
blooming
gloriously
after
a
favourable
season
klaus
heinrich
threw
the
reins
to
a
servant
and
went
up
and
looked
at
the
roses
they
were
exceptionally
fine
full
and
velvety
grandly
formed
and
a
real
masterwork
of
nature
several
were
already
call
ezekiel
please
said
klaus
heinrich
to
a
moustachioed
who
came
forward
with
his
hand
to
his
hat
ezekiel
the
custodian
of
the
came
he
was
a
greybeard
of
seventy
years
of
age
in
a
gardener
apron
with
watery
eyes
and
a
bent
back
have
you
any
shears
by
you
ezekiel
said
klaus
heinrich
i
should
like
a
rose
and
ezekiel
drew
some
shears
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
apron
that
one
there
said
klaus
heinrich
that
the
finest
and
the
old
man
cut
the
thorny
branch
with
trembling
hands
i
water
it
royal
highness
he
said
and
shuffled
off
to
the
in
a
corner
of
the
court
when
he
came
back
glittering
drops
were
clinging
to
the
petals
of
the
rose
as
if
to
the
feathers
of
waterfowl
thanks
ezekiel
said
klaus
heinrich
and
took
the
rose
still
going
strong
here
he
gave
the
old
man
a
gold
piece
and
climbing
into
the
dogcart
drove
with
the
rose
on
the
seat
beside
him
through
the
courtyards
everybody
who
saw
him
thought
that
he
was
driving
back
to
the
hermitage
from
the
old
schloss
where
presumably
he
had
an
interview
with
the
grand
duke
but
he
drove
through
the
town
gardens
to
delphinenort
the
sky
had
clouded
over
big
drops
were
already
falling
on
the
leaves
and
thunder
rolled
in
the
distance
the
ladies
were
at
tea
when
klaus
heinrich
conducted
by
the
corpulent
butler
appeared
in
the
gallery
and
walked
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
room
spoelmann
as
usual
recently
was
not
present
he
was
in
bed
with
poultices
on
percival
who
lay
curled
up
like
a
snail
close
by
imma
chair
beat
the
carpet
with
his
tail
by
way
of
greeting
the
gilding
of
the
furniture
looked
dull
as
the
park
beyond
the
glass
door
lay
in
a
damp
mist
klaus
heinrich
exchanged
a
handshake
with
the
daughter
of
the
house
and
kissed
the
countess
hand
while
he
gently
raised
her
from
the
courtly
curtsey
she
had
begun
as
usual
to
make
you
see
summer
has
come
he
said
to
imma
spoelmann
offering
her
the
rose
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
brought
her
flowers
how
courtly
of
you
she
said
thanks
prince
and
what
a
beauty
she
went
on
in
honest
admiration
a
thing
she
hardly
ever
showed
and
held
out
her
small
ringless
hands
for
the
glorious
flower
whose
dewy
petals
curled
exquisitely
at
the
edges
are
there
such
fine
roses
here
where
did
you
get
it
and
she
bent
her
dark
head
eagerly
over
it
her
eyes
were
full
of
horror
when
she
looked
up
again
it
does
smell
she
said
and
a
look
of
disgust
showed
round
her
mouth
wait
though
it
smells
of
decay
she
said
what
this
you
have
brought
me
prince
and
her
big
black
eyes
in
her
pale
face
seemed
to
glow
with
questioning
horror
yes
he
said
i
sorry
that
a
way
our
roses
have
it
from
the
bush
in
one
of
the
courts
of
the
old
schloss
have
you
never
heard
of
it
there
something
hangs
by
that
people
say
that
one
day
it
will
begin
to
smell
exquisite
she
seemed
not
to
be
listening
to
him
it
seems
as
if
it
had
no
soul
she
said
and
looked
at
the
rose
but
it
perfectly
beautiful
that
one
must
allow
well
that
a
doubtful
joke
on
nature
part
prince
all
the
same
prince
thanks
for
your
attention
and
as
it
comes
from
your
ancestral
schloss
one
must
regard
it
with
due
reverence
she
put
the
rose
in
a
glass
by
her
plate
a
flunkey
brought
the
prince
a
cup
and
plate
they
discussed
at
tea
the
bewitched
and
then
commonplace
subjects
such
as
the
court
theatre
their
horses
and
all
sorts
of
trivial
topics
imma
spoelmann
time
after
time
contradicted
him
interposing
polished
quotations
to
her
own
enjoyment
and
his
despair
at
the
range
of
her
reading
quotations
which
she
uttered
in
her
broken
voice
with
whimsical
motions
of
her
head
after
a
time
a
heavy
parcel
was
brought
in
sent
by
the
to
miss
spoelmann
containing
a
number
of
works
which
she
had
had
bound
in
smart
and
durable
bindings
she
opened
the
parcel
and
they
all
three
examined
the
books
to
see
if
the
binder
had
done
his
work
well
they
were
nearly
all
learned
works
whose
contents
were
either
as
as
imma
spoelmann

imma

did
not
display
much
enthusiasm
over
the

klaus

who
had
never
seen
such
handsome
volumes
was
full
of
admiration
shall
you
put
them
all
into
the
bookcase
he
asked
with
the
others
upstairs

as
fine
as
these
do
let
me
see
how
you

with
piling
the
volumes

on
the
other

the
prince
wants
to
see
my
books
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
say
what
you
think
countess
löwenjoul
was
in
a
brown
study
with
her
small
head
bent
she
was
watching
klaus
heinrich
with
a
sharp
almost
hostile
look
and
then
let
her
eyes
wander
to
imma
spoelmann
when
her
expression
altered
and
became
gentle
sympathetic
and
anxious
she
came
to
herself
with
a
smile
and
drew
a
little
watch
out
of
her
brown
dress
at
seven
she
said
brightly
spoelmann
expects
you
to
read
to
him
imma
you
have
half
an
hour
in
which
to
do
what
his
royal
highness
wants

come
along

inspect
my
study
said
imma
and
so
far
as
your
highness
permits
it
please
lend
a
hand
in
carrying
up
these
books
i
take
half
but
klaus
heinrich
took
them
all
he
clasped
them
in
both
arms
though
the
left
was
not
much
use
to
him
and
the
pile
reached
to
his
chin
then
bending
backwards
and
going
carefully
so
as
to
drop
nothing
he
followed
imma
over
into
the
wing
towards
the
drive
on
the
main
floor
of
which
lay
countess
löwenjoul
and
miss
spoelmann
quarters
in
the
big
comfortable
room
which
they
entered
through
a
heavy
door
he
laid
his
burden
down
on
the
top
of
a
hexagonal
ebony
table
which
stood
in
front
of
a
big
sofa
imma
spoelmann
study
was
not
furnished
in
the
style
proper
to
the
schloss
but
in
more
modern
taste
without
any
show
but
with
massive
masculine
serviceable
luxury
it
was
panelled
with
rare
woods
right
up
to
the
top
and
adorned
with
old
porcelain
which
glittered
on
the
brackets
all
round
under
the
ceiling
the
carpets
were
persian
the
mantelpiece
black
marble
on
which
stood
shapely
vases
and
a
gilt
clock
the
chairs
were
broad
and
and
the
curtains
of
the
same
golden
stuff
as
the
a
capacious
desk
stood
in
front
of
the
which
allowed
a
view
of
the
big
basin
in
front
of
the
schloss
one
wall
was
covered
with
books
but
the
main
library
was
in
the
adjacent
room
which
was
smaller
and
carpeted
like
the
big
one
a
glass
door
opened
into
it
and
its
walls
were
completely
covered
with
bookshelves
right
up
to
the
ceiling
well
prince
there
my
hermitage
said
imma
spoelmann
i
hope
you
like
it
why
it
glorious
he
said
but
he
did
not
look
round
him
but
gazed
unintermittently
at
her
as
she
reclined
against
the
sofa
cushions
by
the
hexagonal
table
she
was
wearing
one
of
her
beautiful
indoor
dresses
a
summer
one
this
time
made
of
white
stuff
with
open
sleeves
and
gold
embroidery
on
the
yoke
the
skin
of
her
arms
and
neck
seemed
brown
as
meerschaum
against
the
white
of
the
dress
her
big
bright
earnest
eyes
in
the
strangely
childlike
face
seemed
to
speak
a
language
of
their
own
unceasingly
and
a
smooth
wisp
of
black
hair
hung
across
her
forehead
she
had
klaus
heinrich
rose
in
her
hand
how
lovely
he
said
standing
before
her
and
not
conscious
of
what
he
meant
his
blue
eyes
above
the
national
were
heavy
as
with
grief
you
have
as
many
books
he
added
as
my
sister
ditlinde
has
flowers
has
the
princess
so
many
flowers
yes
but
of
late
she
has
not
set
so
much
store
by
them
let
clear
these
away
she
said
and
took
up
some
books
no
wait
he
said
anxiously
i
such
a
lot
to
say
to
you
and
our
time
is
so
short
you
must
know
that
is
my
birthday
that
why
i
came
and
brought
you
the
rose
oh
she
said
that
is
an
event
your
birthday
well
i
sure
that
you
received
all
your
congratulations
with
the
dignity
you
always
show
you
may
have
mine
as
well
it
was
sweet
of
you
to
bring
me
the
rose
although
it
has
its
doubtful
side
and
she
tried
the
mouldy
smell
once
more
with
an
expression
of
fear
on
her
face
how
old
are
you
prince
he
answered
i
was
born
years
ago
in
the
grimmburg
ever
since
then
i
had
a
strenuous
and
lonely
time
of
it
she
did
not
answer
and
suddenly
he
saw
her
eyes
under
her
slightly
frowning
move
to
his
side
yes
although
he
was
standing
sideways
to
her
with
his
right
shoulder
towards
her
as
he
had
trained
himself
to
do
he
could
not
prevent
her
eyes
fastening
on
his
left
arm
on
the
hand
which
he
had
planted
right
back
on
his
hip
were
you
born
with
that
she
asked
softly
he
grew
pale
but
with
a
cry
which
rang
like
a
cry
of
redemption
he
sank
down
before
her
and
clasped
her
wondrous
form
in
both
his
arms
there
he
lay
in
his
white
trousers
and
his
blue
and
red
coat
with
the
major
little
sister
he
said
little
sister
she
answered
with
a
pout
think
of
appearances
prince
i
consider
that
one
should
not
let
oneself
go
but
should
keep
up
appearances
on
all
occasions
but
he
was
too
far
gone
and
raising
his
face
to
her
his
eyes
in
a
mist
he
only
said
imma
little
imma
then
she
took
his
hand
the
left
atrophied
one
the
deformity
the
hindrance
in
his
lofty
calling
which
he
had
been
wont
from
boyhood
to
hide
artfully
and
carefully
she
took
it
and
kissed
it
viii
the
fulfilment
grave
reports
were
flying
around
concerning
the
state
of
health
of
the
finance
minister
doctor
krippenreuther
people
hinted
at
nervous
at
a
progressive
which
indeed
herr
krippenreuther
flabby
yellow
complexion
was
calculated
to
suggest
what
is
greatness
the
the
journeyman
might
envy
this
tortured
dignitary
his
title
his
chain
his
rank
at
court
his
important
office
to
which
he
had
climbed
so
pertinaciously
only
to
wear
himself
out
in
it
but
not
when
these
all
meant
the
concomitant
of
his
illness
his
retirement
was
repeatedly
announced
to
be
impending
it
was
said
to
be
due
simply
and
solely
to
the
grand
duke
dislike
of
new
faces
as
well
as
to
the
consideration
that
matters
could
not
be
improved
by
a
change
of
personnel
that
his
resignation
had
not
already
become
a
fact
krippenreuther
had
spent
his
summer
leave
in
a
in
the
hills
perhaps
he
might
have
improved
somewhat
up
there
but
anyhow
after
his
return
his
recouped
strength
ebbed
away
quickly
again
for
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
parliamentary
session
a
rift
had
come
between
him
and
the
budget
commission
serious
dissensions
which
were
certainly
not
from
any
want
of
industry
on
his
part
but
from
the
circumstances
from
the
incurable
position
of
affairs
in
the
middle
of
september
albrecht
ii
opened
the
landtag
in
the
old
schloss
with
the
traditional
ceremonies
they
began
with
an
invocation
to
god
by
the
court
chaplain
dom
wislezenus
in
the
schloss
chapel
then
the
grand
duke
accompanied
by
prince
klaus
heinrich
went
in
solemn
procession
to
the
here
the
members
of
both
chambers
the
ministers
court
officials
and
many
others
in
uniform
and
civil
dress
greeted
the
royal
brothers
with
three
cheers
led
by
the
president
of
the
first
chamber
a
count
prenzlau
albrecht
had
earnestly
wished
to
transfer
to
his
brother
his
duties
in
the
formal
ceremony
it
was
only
owing
to
the
urgent
objections
of
herr
von
knobelsdorff
that
he
walked
in
the
procession
behind
the
pages
he
was
so
much
ashamed
of
his
braided
hussar
coat
his
gaudy
trousers
and
the
whole
that
he
showed
clearly
in
his
face
his
anger
and
his
embarrassment
his
were
twisted
in
his
nervousness
as
he
mounted
the
steps
to
the
throne
then
he
took
his
stand
in
front
of
the
theatrical
chair
under
the
faded
baldachin
and
sucked
at
his
upper
lip
his
small
bearded
unmilitary
head
rested
on
the
white
collar
which
stuck
out
far
above
the
silver
and
his
blue
eyes
gazed
vacantly
in
front
of
him
the
jangle
of
the
spurs
of
the
who
handed
him
the
manuscript
of
his
speech
from
the
throne
rang
through
the
hall
in
which
silence
now
reigned
and
quietly
with
a
slight
lisp
and
more
than
one
sudden
burst
of
coughing
the
grand
duke
read
what
had
been
written
for
him
the
speech
was
the
most
palliatory
that
had
ever
been
heard
each
humiliating
fact
from
outside
being
by
some
virtuous
trait
or
other
in
the
people
he
began
by
praising
the
industrious
spirit
of
the
whole
country
then
admitted
that
there
was
no
actual
increase
to
show
in
any
branch
of
manufacture
so
that
the
sources
of
revenue
failed
to
show
under
any
head
the
fertility
that
could
be
desired
he
remarked
with
satisfaction
how
the
feeling
for
the
public
good
and
economical
were
spreading
more
and
more
through
the
population
and
then
declared
without
mincing
matters
that
notwithstanding
a
general
most
acceptable
increase
in
the
taxation
returns
as
the
result
of
the
influx
of
wealthy
foreigners
meaning
spoelmann
any
relaxation
of
the
calls
on
the
said
noble
was
not
to
be
thought
of
even
without
this
he
continued
it
had
been
impossible
to
budget
for
all
the
objects
of
the
financial
policy
and
should
it
prove
that
sufficient
reduction
in
the
public
debt
had
not
been
successfully
provided
for
the
government
considered
that
the
continuation
of
policy
of
moderate
loans
would
prove
the
best
way
out
of
the
financial
complications
in
any
event
it
the
government
felt
itself
supported
in
these
most
unfavourable
circumstances
by
the
confidence
of
the
nation
that
faith
in
the
future
which
was
so
fair
a
heritage
of
our
stock
and
the
speech
from
the
throne
left
the
sinister
topic
of
public
economy
as
soon
as
possible
to
apply
itself
to
less
disputatious
subjects
such
as
ecclesiastical
educational
and
legal
matters
minister
of
state
von
knobelsdorff
declared
in
the
monarch
name
the
landtag
to
be
open
and
the
cheers
which
accompanied
albrecht
when
he
left
the
hall
sounded
somewhat
ironical
and
dubious
as
the
weather
was
still
summery
he
went
straight
back
to
hollerbrunn
from
which
necessity
alone
had
driven
him
to
the
capital
he
had
done
his
part
and
the
rest
was
the
concern
of
herr
krippenreuther
and
the
landtag
quarrels
began
as
has
been
said
immediately
and
about
several
topics
at
once
the
property
tax
the
meat
tax
and
the
civil
service
estimates
for
when
the
deputies
proved
adamant
against
attempts
to
persuade
them
to
sanction
fresh
taxes
doctor
krippenreuther
meditative
mind
had
hit
on
the
idea
of
converting
the
income
tax
which
had
been
usual
hitherto
into
a
property
tax
which
on
the
basis
of
per
cent
would
produce
an
increment
of
about
a
million
how
direly
needed
indeed
how
inadequate
such
an
increment
was
was
clear
from
the
main
budget
for
the
new
financial
year
which
leaving
out
of
account
the
imposition
of
new
burdens
on
the
treasury
concluded
with
an
adverse
balance
which
was
calculated
to
damp
the
courage
of
any
economical
expert
but
when
it
was
realized
that
practically
only
the
towns
would
be
hit
by
the
property
tax
the
combined
indignation
of
the
urban
deputies
turned
against
the
assessment
of
per
and
they
demanded
as
compensation
at
least
the
abolition
of
the
meat
tax
which
they
called
undemocratic
and
antediluvian
add
to
this
that
the
commission
adhered
resolutely
to
the
long
promised
and
always
postponed
improvement
of
civil
pay
for
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
salaries
of
the
government
officials
clergy
and
teachers
of
the
grand
duchy
were
miserable
but
doctor
krippenreuther
could
not
make
gold
he
said
in
so
many
words
i
never
learnt
to
make
gold
and
he
found
himself
equally
unable
to
abolish
the
meat
tax
and
to
ameliorate
the
conditions
in
the
civil
service
his
only
resource
was
to
anchor
himself
to
his
per
although
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
its
sanction
would
not
really
bring
things
any
nearer
their
solution
for
the
position
was
serious
and
despondent
spirits
painted
it
in
gloomy
colours
the
almanac
of
the
grand
ducal
statistical
bureau
contained
alarming
returns
of
the
harvest
for
the
last
year
agriculture
had
a
succession
of
bad
years
to
show
storms
hail
droughts
and
inordinate
rain
had
been
the
lot
of
the
peasants
an
exceptionally
cold
and
snowless
winter
had
resulted
in
the
seed
freezing
and
the
critics
maintained
though
with
little
proof
to
show
for
it
that
the
had
already
influenced
the
climate
at
any
rate
figures
proved
that
the
total
yield
of
corn
had
decreased
in
a
most
disquieting
degree
the
straw
besides
being
deficient
in
quantity
left
much
to
be
wished
from
the
point
of
view
of
quality
in
the
opinion
of
the
compilers
of
the
report
the
figures
of
the
potato
harvest
fell
far
below
the
average
of
the
preceding
decade
not
to
mention
that
no
less
than
per
cent
of
the
potatoes
were
diseased
as
to
artificial
these
showed
for
the
last
two
years
results
both
in
quality
and
quantity
which
for
clover
and
manure
were
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
the
years
under
review
and
things
were
no
better
with
the
rapeseed
harvest
or
with
the
first
and
second
hay
crops
the
decline
in
agriculture
was
baldly
shown
in
the
increase
of
forced
sales
whose
figures
in
the
year
under
review
had
advanced
in
a
striking
way
but
the
failure
of
crops
entailed
a
falling
off
in
the
produce
of
taxation
which
would
have
been
regrettable
in
any
country
but
in
ours
could
not
help
having
a
fatal
effect
as
to
the
forests
nothing
had
been
made
out
of
them
one
disaster
had
followed
another
blight
and
moths
had
attacked
the
woods
more
than
once
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
owing
to
the
woods
had
lost
seriously
in
capital
value
the
they
had
for
a
long
time
proved
barren
the
work
had
been
interrupted
by
convulsions
of
nature
and
as
the
repairs
would
have
cost
large
sums
and
the
results
had
never
showed
signs
of
coming
up
to
expectations
it
had
been
found
necessary
provisionally
to
suspend
the
workings
though
this
threw
a
number
of
labourers
out
of
work
and
caused
distress
in
whole
districts
enough
has
been
said
to
explain
how
matters
stood
with
the
ordinary
state
revenues
in
this
time
of
trial
the
slowly
advancing
crisis
the
deficit
carried
forward
from
one
year
to
another
had
become
burning
owing
to
the
straits
of
the
people
and
the
unfavourableness
of
the
elements
it
had
begun
to
cry
aloud
for
remedy
and
when
one
looked
around
despairingly
for
the
remedy
or
even
for
means
of
alleviation
the
most
purblind
could
not
fail
to
see
the
whole
hideousness
of
our
financial
condition
there
could
be
no
thought
of
voting
for
new
expenditure
the
country
was
naturally
incapable
of
bearing
much
taxation
it
was
now
exhausted
its
powers
adversely
affected
and
the
critics
declared
that
the
sight
of
insufficiently
nourished
human
beings
was
becoming
more
and
more
common
in
the
country
they
attributed
this
firstly
to
the
shocking
taxes
on
provisions
and
secondly
to
the
direct
taxation
which
was
known
to
oblige
to
turn
all
their
into
cash
as
to
the
other
less
respectable
though
enticingly
easy
remedy
for
dearth
of
money
of
which
the
financial
authorities
were
well
aware
namely
the
raising
of
a
loan
the
time
was
come
when
an
improper
and
inconsiderate
use
of
this
means
must
begin
to
bring
its
own
bitter
punishment
the
liquidation
of
the
national
debt
had
been
taken
in
hand
for
a
time
in
a
clumsy
and
harmful
way
then
under
albrecht
ii
it
had
stopped
altogether
the
yawning
rifts
in
the
state
had
received
an
emergency
stuffing
of
new
loans
and
paper
issues
and
subsequent
finance
ministers
had
grown
pale
to
find
themselves
faced
with
a
floating
consolidated
debt
redeemable
at
an
early
date
whose
total
was
scandalously
large
for
the
total
number
of
heads
of
the
population
krippenreuther
had
not
shrunk
from
the
practical
steps
open
to
the
state
in
such
a
predicament
he
had
steered
clear
of
big
capital
obligations
had
demanded
compulsory
redemption
of
bonds
and
while
reducing
the
rate
of
interest
had
converted
debts
over
the
heads
of
the
creditors
into
perpetual
but
these
had
to
be
paid
and
while
this
incumbrance
was
an
unbearable
burden
on
the
national
economy
the
lowness
of
the
rate
of
exchange
caused
every
fresh
issue
of
bonds
to
bring
in
less
capital
proceeds
to
the
treasury
still
more
the
economic
crisis
in
the
grand
duchy
had
the
effect
of
making
foreign
creditors
demand
payments
at
an
exceptionally
early
date
this
again
lowered
the
rate
of
exchange
and
resulted
in
an
increased
flow
of
gold
out
of
the
country
and
were
daily
occurrences
in
the
business
world
in
a
word
our
credit
was
shattered
our
paper
stood
far
below
its
nominal
value
and
though
the
landtag
might
perhaps
have
preferred
to
vote
a
new
loan
to
voting
new
taxes
the
conditions
which
would
have
been
imposed
upon
the
country
were
such
that
the
negotiation
seemed
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
on
the
top
of
everything
else
came
this
unpleasant
factor
that
the
people
were
at
that
moment
suffering
from
the
burden
of
that
general
economical
disorder
that
appreciation
in
the
price
of
gold
which
is
still
vivid
in
everybody
memory
what
was
to
be
done
to
get
safe
to
land
whither
turn
to
appease
the
hunger
for
gold
which
was
devouring
us
the
disposal
of
the
then
unproductive
and
the
application
of
the
proceeds
to
the
payment
of
the
debts
at
high
interest
was
discussed
at
length
yet
as
matters
stood
the
sale
could
not
help
turning
out
disadvantageously
further
not
only
would
the
state
lose
altogether
the
capital
sunk
in
the
mines
but
would
relinquish
its
prospect
of
a
return
which
might
perhaps
sooner
or
later
materialize
finally
buyers
did
not
grow
on
every
bush
for
one
moment
a
moment
of
psychical
despondency
the
sale
of
the
national
forests
even
was
mooted
but
it
must
be
said
that
there
was
still
sense
enough
in
the
country
to
prevent
our
woods
being
surrendered
to
private
industry
to
complete
the
picture
still
further
rumours
of
sales
were
current
rumours
which
suggested
that
the
financial
embarrassment
penetrated
even
to
quarters
which
the
loyal
people
had
always
hoped
were
far
removed
from
all
the
rubs
of
the
time
the
which
was
never
used
to
sacrifice
a
piece
of
news
to
its
sympathetic
feelings
was
the
first
to
publish
the
news
that
two
of
the
grand
duke
schlosses
pastime
and
favourite
in
the
open
country
had
been
put
up
for
sale
considering
that
neither
property
was
of
any
further
use
as
a
residence
for
the
royal
family
and
that
both
demanded
yearly
increasing
outlay
the
administrators
of
the
crown
trust
property
had
given
notice
in
the
proper
quarter
for
steps
to
be
taken
to
sell
them
what
did
that
imply
it
was
obviously
quite
a
different
case
from
that
of
the
sale
of
delphinenort
which
had
been
the
result
of
a
quite
exceptional
and
favourable
offer
as
well
as
a
smart
stroke
of
business
on
behalf
of
the
state
people
who
were
brutal
enough
to
give
a
name
to
things
which
finer
feeling
shrinks
from
specifying
declared
right
out
that
the
treasury
had
been
mercilessly
set
on
by
disquieted
creditors
and
that
their
consent
to
such
sales
showed
that
they
were
exposed
to
relentless
pressure
how
far
had
matters
gone
into
whose
hands
would
the
schlosses
fall
the
more
benevolent
who
asked
this
question
were
inclined
to
find
comfort
in
and
to
believe
a
further
report
which
was
spread
by
the
wiseacres
namely
that
on
this
occasion
too
the
buyer
was
no
one
else
but
samuel
spoelmann
an
entirely
groundless
and
fantastic
report
which
however
proves
what
a
rôle
in
the
world
of
popular
imagination
was
played
by
the
lonely
suffering
little
man
who
had
settled
down
in
such
princely
style
in
their
midst
yonder
he
lived
with
his
physician
his
electric
organ
and
his
collection
of
glass
behind
the
pillars
the
bow
windows
and
the
chiselled
festoons
of
the
schloss
which
had
risen
from
its
ruins
at
a
nod
from
him
he
was
hardly
ever
seen
he
was
always
in
bed
with
poultices
but
people
saw
his
daughter
that
curious
creature
with
the
whimsical
features
who
lived
like
a
princess
had
a
countess
for
a
companion
studied
algebra
and
had
walked
in
a
temper
unimpeded
right
through
the
guard
people
saw
her
and
they
sometimes
saw
prince
klaus
heinrich
at
her
side
raoul
ueberbein
had
used
a
strong
expression
when
he
declared
that
the
public
held
their
breath
at
the
sight
but
he
really
was
right
and
it
can
be
truly
said
that
the
population
of
our
town
as
a
whole
never
followed
a
social
or
public
proceeding
with
such
passionate
such
surpassing
eagerness
as
klaus
heinrich
visits
to
delphinenort
the
prince
himself
acted
up
to
a
certain
point
namely
up
to
a
certain
conversation
with
his
excellency
the
minister
of
state
knobelsdorff
blindly
without
regard
to
the
outside
world
and
in
obedience
only
to
an
inner
impulse
but
his
tutor
was
justified
in
deriding
in
his
fatherly
way
his
idea
that
his
proceedings
could
be
kept
hid
from
the
world
for
whether
it
was
that
the
servants
on
both
sides
did
not
hold
their
tongues
or
that
the
public
had
the
opportunity
of
direct
observation
at
any
rate
klaus
heinrich
had
not
met
miss
spoelmann
once
since
that
first
meeting
in
the
dorothea
hospital
without
its
being
remarked
and
discussed
remarked
no
spied
on
glared
at
and
greedily
jumped
at
discussed
rather
smothered
in
floods
of
talk
the
intercourse
of
the
two
was
the
topic
of
conversation
in
court
circles
salons
and
bedrooms
barbers
shops
workrooms
and
servants
halls
by
cabmen
on
the
ranks
and
girls
at
the
gates
it
occupied
the
minds
of
men
no
less
than
women
of
course
with
the
variations
which
are
inherent
in
the
different
ways
the
sexes
have
of
looking
at
things
the
always
sympathetic
interest
in
it
had
a
uniting
levelling
effect
it
bridged
over
the
social
gaps
and
one
might
hear
the
tram
conductor
turn
to
the
smart
passenger
on
the
platform
with
the
question
whether
he
knew
that
yesterday
afternoon
the
prince
had
again
spent
an
hour
at
delphinenort
but
what
was
at
once
remarkable
in
itself
and
at
the
same
time
decisive
for
the
future
was
that
throughout
there
never
seemed
for
one
moment
to
be
any
feeling
of
scandal
in
the
air
nor
did
all
the
seem
merely
the
vulgar
pleasure
in
startling
events
in
high
quarters
from
the
very
beginning
before
any
had
had
time
to
form
the
discussion
of
the
subject
however
animated
was
always
pitched
in
a
key
of
approval
and
agreement
indeed
the
prince
if
it
had
occurred
to
him
at
an
earlier
stage
to
adapt
his
conduct
to
public
opinion
would
have
realized
at
once
to
his
delight
how
entirely
popular
that
conduct
was
for
when
he
called
miss
spoelmann
a
princess
to
his
tutor
he
had
quite
properly
accurately
expressed
his
people
mind
that
people
which
always
surrounds
the
uncommon
and
visionary
with
a
cloud
of
poetry
yes
to
the
people
the
pale
dark
precious
and
strangely
lovely
creature
of
mixed
blood
who
had
come
to
us
from
the
antipodes
to
live
her
lonely
and
unprecedented
life
amongst
us
to
the
people
she
was
a
princess
or
from
fableland
a
princess
in
the
world
most
wonderful
meaning
but
everything
her
own
behaviour
as
much
as
the
attitude
of
the
world
towards
her
contributed
to
make
her
appear
a
princess
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
also
did
she
not
live
with
her
companion
countess
in
a
schloss
as
was
meet
and
right
did
she
not
drive
in
her
gorgeous
motor
or
her
to
the
benevolent
institutions
the
homes
for
the
blind
for
orphans
and
for
deaconesses
the
public
kitchens
and
the
to
teach
herself
and
to
stimulate
them
by
her
inspection
like
a
complete
princess
had
she
not
subscribed
to
support
the
victims
of
flood
and
fire
out
of
her
privy
purse
as
the
was
precise
enough
to
declare
subscriptions
which
nearly
equalled
those
of
the
grand
duke
did
not
exceed
them
as
was
noticed
with
general
satisfaction
did
not
the
newspapers
publish
almost
daily
immediately
under
the
court
news
reports
of
spoelmann
varying
health
whether
the
colic
kept
him
in
bed
or
whether
he
had
resumed
his
morning
visits
to
the
were
not
the
white
liveries
of
his
servants
as
much
a
part
of
the
picture
in
the
streets
of
the
capital
as
the
brown
of
the
grand
ducal
lackeys
did
not
foreigners
with
ask
to
be
taken
out
to
delphinenort
there
to
gloat
over
the
sight
of
spoelmann
house
many
of
them
before
they
had
seen
the
old
schloss
were
not
both
schlosses
the
old
and
delphinenort
about
equally
centres
and
foci
of
the
city
to
what
circle
of
society
belonged
that
human
being
who
had
been
born
samuel
spoelmann
daughter
that
creature
without
counterpart
without
analogy
to
whom
should
she
attach
herself
with
whom
have
intercourse
nothing
could
be
less
surprising
nothing
more
obvious
and
natural
than
to
see
klaus
heinrich
at
her
side
and
even
those
who
had
never
enjoyed
that
sight
enjoyed
it
in
the
spirit
and
gloated
over
it
the
slim
solemnly
familiar
figure
of
the
prince
by
the
side
of
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
prodigious
little
foreigner
who
ill
and
peevish
as
he
was
disposed
of
a
fortune
which
amounted
to
nearly
twice
as
much
as
our
national
debt
then
one
day
a
memory
a
wonderful
disposition
of
words
took
hold
of
the
public
conscience
nobody
can
say
who
first
pointed
to
it
recalled
it
that
is
quite
uncertain
perhaps
it
was
a
woman
perhaps
a
child
with
credulous
eyes
whom
somebody
was
sending
to
sleep
with
stories
heaven
only
knows
but
a
ghostly
form
began
to
show
liveliness
in
the
popular
imagination
the
shadow
of
an
old
grey
and
bent
with
an
inward
squint
who
drew
her
stick
through
the
sand
and
whose
mumbling
had
been
written
down
and
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
the
greatest
happiness
it
should
come
to
the
land
through
a
prince
with
one
hand
he
would
give
the
country
the
prophecy
ran
more
with
his
one
hand
than
others
could
with
two
with
one
but
was
everything
all
right
with
klaus
heinrich
slim
figure
when
one
thought
of
it
was
there
not
a
weakness
a
defect
in
his
person
which
one
always
avoided
seeing
when
addressing
him
partly
from
shyness
and
partly
because
with
charming
skill
he
made
it
so
easy
not
to
notice
it
when
one
saw
him
in
his
carriage
he
kept
his
left
hand
on
his
covered
with
his
right
one
could
see
him
under
a
baldachin
on
a
platform
take
up
a
position
slightly
turned
to
the
left
with
his
left
hand
planted
somehow
on
his
hip
his
left
arm
was
too
short
the
hand
was
stunted
everybody
knew
that
and
knew
various
explanations
of
the
origin
of
the
defect
although
respect
and
distance
had
not
allowed
a
clear
view
of
it
or
even
its
recognition
in
so
many
words
but
now
everybody
saw
it
it
could
never
be
ascertained
who
first
whispered
and
quoted
the
prophecy
in
this
connexion
whether
it
was
a
child
or
a
girl
or
a
greybeard
on
the
threshold
of
the
beyond
but
what
is
certain
is
that
it
was
the
people
who
started
it
the
people
who
imposed
certain
thoughts
and
hopes
and
quite
soon
their
conception
of
miss
spoelmann
personality
on
the
cultured
classes
right
up
to
the
highest
quarters
and
exercised
a
powerful
influence
on
them
from
below
that
the
impartial
unprejudiced
belief
of
the
people
afforded
the
broad
and
firm
foundation
for
all
that
came
later
with
one
hand
people
asked
and
the
greatest
happiness
they
saw
klaus
heinrich
in
the
spirit
by
imma
spoelmann
side
with
his
left
hand
on
his
hip
and
still
incompetent
to
think
their
thought
out
to
its
conclusion
they
quivered
at
their
at
that
time
everything
was
still
in
the
clouds
and
nobody
thought
anything
out
to
its
conclusion
not
even
the
persons
most
immediately
concerned
for
the
relations
between
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
spoelmann
were
wondrous
strange
and
their
minds
his
as
well
could
not
be
brought
to
centre
on
any
immediate
palpable
goal
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
laconic
conversation
on
the
afternoon
of
the
prince
birthday
when
miss
spoelmann
had
showed
him
her
books
had
made
but
the
slightest
if
any
alteration
in
their
relations
klaus
heinrich
may
have
gone
back
to
the
hermitage
in
that
condition
of
heated
enthusiasm
proper
to
young
people
on
such
occasions
convinced
that
something
decisive
had
happened
but
he
soon
learned
that
his
wooing
of
what
he
had
recognized
to
be
his
only
happiness
was
only
now
really
beginning
but
as
has
been
said
this
wooing
could
not
aim
at
any
objective
result
a
bourgeois
promise
or
such
an
idea
was
almost
inconceivable
and
besides
the
prince
lived
in
too
great
seclusion
from
the
practical
world
for
such
an
end
to
present
itself
to
him
in
fact
the
object
of
klaus
heinrich
pleadings
with
looks
and
words
from
that
time
onward
was
not
that
miss
spoelmann
should
reciprocate
the
feelings
he
entertained
towards
her
but
that
she
might
feel
impelled
to
believe
in
the
reality
and
liveliness
of
those
feelings
for
that
was
what
she
did
not
do
he
let
two
weeks
pass
before
he
sent
in
his
name
at
delphinenort
again
and
during
these
he
feasted
spiritually
on
what
had
already
occurred
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
supersede
that
happening
with
a
new
one
besides
his
time
just
now
was
occupied
by
several
representative
functions
including
the
annual
festival
of
the
miniature
range
rifle
club
whose
patron
he
was
and
in
whose
anniversary
festival
he
annually
took
part
here
he
was
received
in
his
green
uniform
as
if
his
sole
interest
in
life
was
by
the
united
members
of
the
association
with
an
enthusiastic
welcome
was
conducted
to
the
butts
and
after
an
unappetizing
luncheon
with
the
distinguished
members
of
the
committee
fired
several
shots
in
a
gracefully
expert
attitude
in
the
direction
of
various
targets
when
he
proceeded
it
was
the
middle
of
june
to
pay
another
afternoon
visit
to
the
spoelmanns
he
found
imma
in
a
very
mocking
mood
and
her
mode
of
expression
was
unusually
scriptural
and
solemn
spoelmann
also
was
present
this
time
and
although
his
presence
robbed
klaus
heinrich
of
the
he
so
much
desired
with
the
daughter
yet
it
helped
him
in
a
quite
unexpected
way
to
bear
up
against
the
wounds
which
imma
sharpness
gave
him
for
samuel
spoelmann
was
friendly
and
almost
affectionate
towards
him
they
had
tea
on
the
terrace
sitting
in
of
an
shape
with
the
breezes
from
the
softly
fanning
them
the
master
of
the
house
lay
under
a
and
coverlet
stretched
by
the
table
on
a
cane
couch
fitted
with
silk
cushions
he
had
left
his
bed
for
the
sake
of
the
mild
air
but
his
cheeks
were
not
inflamed
but
of
a
sallow
paleness
and
his
eyes
were
muddy
his
chin
protruded
sharply
his
prominent
nose
looked
longer
than
ever
and
his
tone
was
not
cross
as
usual
but
sad
a
bad
sign
by
his
head
sat
doctor
watercloose
with
his
continual
soft
smile
hullo
young
prince
said
spoelmann
in
a
tired
tone
and
answered
the
other
inquiry
as
to
his
health
merely
with
half
a
grunt
imma
in
a
shimmering
dress
with
a
high
waist
and
bolero
poured
water
into
the
pot
out
of
the
electric
kettle
she
congratulated
the
prince
with
a
pout
on
his
personal
prowess
at
the
rifle
festival
she
had
she
said
as
she
wagged
her
head
backwards
and
forwards
read
an
account
of
it
in
the
daily
press
with
deep
satisfaction
and
had
read
aloud
the
description
of
his
exploits
as
marksman
to
the
countess
the
latter
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
tight
brown
dress
at
the
table
and
handling
her
spoon
gracefully
without
in
any
way
letting
herself
go
it
was
spoelmann
who
did
the
talking
this
time
he
did
it
as
has
been
said
in
a
soft
sad
way
the
result
of
all
his
suffering
he
recounted
an
occurrence
an
experience
of
years
gone
by
which
was
obviously
still
fresh
to
him
and
which
always
brought
him
new
suffering
on
the
days
when
his
health
was
bad
he
recounted
the
short
and
simple
story
twice
with
even
greater
the
second
time
than
the
first
he
had
wished
to
make
one
of
his
endowments
not
one
of
the
first
rank
but
a
pretty
considerable
one
he
had
given
a
big
philanthropic
institute
in
the
united
states
to
understand
in
writing
that
he
wished
to
devote
a
million
in
railway
bonds
to
the
furtherance
of
their
noble
work
safe
paper
of
the
south
pacific
railway
said
spoelmann
and
slapped
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
if
to
show
the
paper
but
what
had
the
philanthropic
institute
done
it
had
refused
the
gift
rejected
it
adding
in
so
many
words
that
it
preferred
to
go
without
the
support
of
questionable
and
plunder
they
had
actually
done
that
spoelmann
lips
quivered
as
he
recounted
it
the
first
time
no
less
than
the
second
and
longing
for
comfort
and
expressions
of
disapproval
he
looked
round
the
table
with
his
little
metallic
eyes
that
was
not
philanthropic
of
the
philanthropic
institute
said
klaus
heinrich
no
it
certainly
was
not
and
the
shake
of
his
head
was
so
decided
his
disgust
and
sympathy
so
obvious
that
spoelmann
cheered
up
a
little
and
declared
that
it
was
lovely
outside
and
the
trees
down
yonder
smelt
nice
indeed
he
took
the
first
opportunity
of
showing
his
young
guest
his
appreciation
and
satisfaction
in
the
clearest
manner
for
klaus
heinrich
had
caught
a
chill
with
this
constant
alternations
between
warm
weather
and
cooling
showers
and
hailstorms
his
neck
was
swollen
his
throat
felt
sore
when
he
swallowed
and
as
his
lofty
calling
and
a
certain
amount
of
of
his
person
in
request
as
it
was
for
exhibition
had
necessarily
made
him
rather
delicate
he
could
not
help
alluding
to
it
and
complaining
of
the
pain
in
his
neck
you
must
have
wet
compresses
said
spoelmann
have
you
any
klaus
heinrich
had
none
then
spoelmann
threw
off
the
parrot
coverlet
stood
up
and
went
inside
the
schloss
he
would
not
answer
any
questions
insisted
on
going
and
went
when
he
had
gone
the
others
asked
each
other
what
he
intended
to
do
and
doctor
watercloose
fearing
lest
an
attack
of
pain
had
seized
his
patient
hurried
after
him
but
when
spoelmann
returned
he
had
in
his
hand
a
piece
of
whose
existence
in
some
drawer
he
had
remembered
a
rather
creased
piece
which
he
handed
to
the
prince
with
precise
directions
how
to
use
it
so
as
to
get
the
most
good
out
of
it
klaus
heinrich
thanked
him
delightedly
and
spoelmann
got
contentedly
back
on
to
his
couch
this
time
he
stayed
there
till
the
end
of
tea
when
he
proposed
a
general
walk
round
the
park
in
the
following
order
spoelmann
in
his
soft
slippers
between
imma
and
klaus
heinrich
while
countess
löwenjoul
followed
at
a
short
distance
with
watercloose
when
the
prince
took
leave
for
the
day
imma
spoelmann
made
some
sharp
remark
about
his
neck
and
the
wet
compresses
adjured
him
to
nurse
himself
and
to
take
the
utmost
care
of
his
sacred
person
but
although
klaus
heinrich
had
no
adequate
repartee
ready
for
her
she
did
not
expect
or
want
one
yet
it
was
in
a
fairly
cheerful
frame
of
mind
that
he
mounted
his
for
the
piece
of
creased
in
the
back
pocket
of
his
uniform
coat
seemed
to
him
though
unconsciously
a
pledge
of
a
happy
future
however
that
might
be
for
the
present
his
struggle
was
only
beginning
it
was
the
struggle
for
imma
spoelmann
faith
the
struggle
to
make
her
so
far
trust
him
as
to
be
capable
of
deciding
to
leave
the
clear
and
frosty
sphere
wherein
she
had
been
wont
to
play
to
descend
from
the
realms
of
algebra
and
conversational
ridicule
and
to
venture
with
him
into
the
untrodden
zone
that
warmer
more
fragrant
more
fruitful
zone
to
which
he
showed
her
the
way
for
she
was
overpoweringly
shy
of
making
any
such
decision
next
time
he
was
alone
with
her
or
as
good
as
alone
because
countess
löwenjoul
was
the
third
it
was
a
cool
morning
after
a
break
in
the
weather
the
night
before
they
rode
along
the
klaus
heinrich
in
high
boots
with
the
crook
of
his
crop
suspended
between
the
buttons
of
his
grey
cloak
the
sluices
at
the
wooden
bridge
up
stream
were
shut
the
bed
of
the
stream
lay
empty
and
stony
percival
whose
first
outburst
had
died
down
jumped
here
and
there
or
trotted
sideways
in
front
of
the
horses
the
countess
on
isabeau
kept
her
head
on
one
side
and
smiled
klaus
heinrich
was
saying
i
always
thinking
night
and
day
about
something
which
must
have
been
a
dream
i
lie
at
night
and
can
hear
florian
over
in
the
stall
snuffling
it
so
quiet
and
then
i
think
for
certain
it
was
no
dream
but
when
i
see
you
as
i
do
and
did
the
other
day
at
tea
i
can
not
possibly
think
it
anything
more
substantial
she
replied
i
must
ask
you
to
explain
yourself
sire
did
you
show
me
your
books
nineteen
days
ago
miss
spoelmann
or
not
nineteen
days
ago
i
must
count
up
no
let
see
it
eighteen
and
a
half
days
unless
i
quite
out
you
did
show
me
your
books
then
that
is
undoubtedly
correct
prince
and
i
delude
myself
with
the
hope
that
you
liked
them
oh
imma
you
must
talk
like
that
not
now
and
not
to
me
my
heart
is
so
heavy
and
i
have
such
lots
still
to
say
to
you
which
i
get
out
nineteen
days
ago
when
you
showed
me
your
books
your
masses
of
books
how
i
should
love
to
carry
on
where
we
broke
off
then
and
to
forget
all
that
lies
in
between
for
heaven
sake
prince
rather
forget
the
other
why
go
back
to
it
why
remind
yourself
and
me
i
thought
you
had
good
reason
to
observe
the
strictest
silence
on
such
subjects
fancy
letting
yourself
go
like
that
losing
your
to
such
a
degree
if
you
only
knew
imma
how
unutterably
pleasant
it
is
for
me
to
lose
my
no
thanks
that
insulting
do
you
know
that
i
insist
on
your
showing
the
same
towards
me
as
towards
the
rest
of
the
world
i
not
here
to
provide
you
with
relaxation
from
your
princely
existence
how
entirely
you
misunderstand
me
imma
but
i
am
well
aware
that
you
do
so
deliberately
and
only
in
fun
and
that
shows
me
that
you
believe
me
and
do
take
what
i
say
seriously
no
prince
you
really
ask
too
much
have
you
told
me
about
your
life
you
went
to
school
for
show
to
the
university
for
show
you
served
as
a
soldier
for
show
and
still
wear
the
uniform
for
show
you
hold
audiences
for
show
and
play
at
and
heaven
knows
what
else
for
show
you
came
into
the
world
for
show
and
am
i
suddenly
to
believe
that
there
is
anything
serious
about
you
tears
came
to
his
eyes
while
she
said
this
her
words
hurt
him
so
much
he
answered
gently
you
are
right
imma
there
is
a
lot
of
fiction
in
my
life
but
i
did
make
it
or
choose
it
you
must
remember
but
have
done
my
duty
precisely
and
sternly
as
it
was
prescribed
to
me
for
the
edification
of
the
people
and
it
is
not
enough
that
it
has
been
a
hard
one
and
full
of
prohibitions
and
privations
it
must
now
take
revenge
on
me
by
causing
you
not
to
believe
me
you
are
proud
she
said
of
your
calling
and
your
life
prince
i
know
well
and
i
can
not
wish
you
to
break
faith
with
yourself
oh
he
cried
leave
that
to
me
that
about
being
true
to
myself
and
do
give
it
a
thought
i
have
had
experiences
i
have
been
untrue
to
myself
and
have
tried
to
get
round
the
prohibitions
and
it
ended
in
my
disgrace
but
since
i
have
known
you
i
know
i
know
for
the
first
time
that
i
may
for
the
first
time
without
remorse
or
harm
to
what
is
described
as
my
lofty
calling
let
myself
go
like
anybody
else
although
doctor
ueberbein
says
and
says
in
latin
that
that
must
never
be
there
you
see
what
your
friend
said
did
you
yourself
call
him
a
poor
wretch
who
would
come
to
a
sad
end
he
a
fine
character
i
esteem
him
greatly
and
owe
him
many
hints
about
myself
and
things
in
general
but
i
often
thought
about
him
recently
and
as
you
expressed
so
unfavourable
a
verdict
upon
him
then
i
have
spent
hours
considering
your
verdict
and
was
forced
to
own
you
right
for
i
tell
you
imma
how
things
stand
with
doctor
ueberbein
his
whole
life
is
hostile
to
happiness
that
what
it
is
that
seems
to
me
a
very
proper
hostility
said
imma
spoelmann
proper
he
answered
but
wretched
as
you
yourself
said
and
more
sinful
for
it
is
a
sin
against
something
nobler
than
his
severe
propriety
as
i
now
see
and
it
this
sin
in
which
he
wished
to
educate
me
in
his
fatherly
fashion
but
i
now
grown
out
of
his
education
at
this
point
i
have
i
now
independent
and
know
better
and
though
i
may
not
have
convinced
ueberbein
i
convince
you
imma
sooner
or
later
yes
prince
i
must
grant
you
that
you
have
the
powers
of
conviction
your
zeal
carries
one
along
irresistibly
with
it
nineteen
days
you
say
i
maintain
that
eighteen
and
a
half
is
right
but
it
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
in
that
time
you
have
condescended
to
appear
at
delphinenort
once
four
days
ago
he
threw
a
startled
look
at
her
but
imma
you
must
have
patience
with
me
and
some
indulgence
consider
i
still
awkward
this
is
strange
ground
i
do
know
how
it
was
i
believe
i
wanted
to
let
us
have
time
and
then
there
came
several
calls
upon
me
of
course
you
had
to
fire
at
the
targets
for
show
i
read
all
about
it
as
usual
you
had
a
rousing
success
to
show
for
it
you
stood
there
in
your
fancy
dress
and
let
a
whole
meadowful
of
people
love
you
halt
imma
i
beg
you
do
gallop
one
ca
get
a
word
out
love
you
say
but
what
sort
of
love
is
it
a
a
casual
superficial
love
a
love
at
a
distance
which
means
nothing
a
love
in
full
dress
with
no
familiarity
about
it
no
you
absolutely
no
reason
to
be
angry
because
i
express
myself
pleased
with
it
for
i
get
no
good
from
it
only
the
people
do
who
are
elevated
by
it
and
that
their
desire
but
i
too
have
my
desire
imma
and
it
to
you
that
i
turn
how
can
i
help
you
prince
oh
you
know
well
it
confidence
imma
could
you
have
a
little
confidence
in
me
she
looked
at
him
and
the
scrutiny
of
her
big
eyes
had
never
before
been
so
dark
and
piercing
but
for
all
the
urgency
of
his
dumb
pleading
she
turned
away
and
said
with
a
look
which
betrayed
no
secrets
no
prince
klaus
heinrich
i
can
not
he
uttered
a
cry
of
grief
and
his
voice
shook
as
he
asked
and
why
ca
you
she
replied
because
you
prevent
me
how
do
i
prevent
you
please
tell
me
i
beg
and
with
the
reserved
expression
still
on
her
face
her
eyes
dropped
on
her
white
reins
and
rocking
lightly
to
her
horse
walk
she
replied
through
everything
through
your
conduct
through
the
way
and
manner
of
your
being
through
your
highly
distinguished
personality
you
know
well
enough
how
you
prevented
the
poor
countess
from
letting
herself
go
and
forced
her
to
be
and
reasonable
although
it
is
expressly
on
the
ground
of
her
excessive
experiences
that
the
blessing
of
craziness
and
oddness
has
been
vouchsafed
to
her
and
that
i
told
you
that
i
was
well
aware
how
you
had
set
out
to
sober
her
yes
i
know
it
well
for
you
prevent
me
too
from
letting
myself
go
you
sober
me
too
continually
in
every
way
through
your
words
through
your
look
through
your
way
of
sitting
and
standing
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
have
confidence
in
you
i
had
the
opportunity
of
watching
you
in
your
intercourse
with
other
people
but
whether
it
was
doctor
sammet
in
the
dorothea
hospital
or
herr
stavenüter
in
the
it
was
always
the
same
and
it
always
made
me
shiver
you
hold
yourself
erect
and
ask
questions
but
you
do
do
so
out
of
sympathy
you
care
what
the
questions
are
about
no
you
do
care
about
anything
and
you
lay
nothing
to
heart
i
often
seen
it
you
speak
you
express
an
opinion
but
you
might
just
as
well
express
a
quite
different
one
for
in
reality
you
have
no
opinion
and
no
belief
and
the
only
thing
you
care
about
is
your
princely
you
say
sometimes
that
your
calling
is
not
an
easy
one
but
as
you
have
challenged
me
i
ask
you
to
notice
that
it
would
be
easier
to
you
if
you
had
an
opinion
and
a
belief
prince
that
my
opinion
and
belief
how
could
anyone
have
confidence
in
you
no
it
not
confidence
that
you
inspire
but
coldness
and
embarrassment
and
if
i
put
myself
out
to
get
closer
to
you
that
kind
of
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
would
prevent
me
from
doing
so
there
my
answer
for
you
he
had
listened
to
her
with
painful
tension
had
looked
more
than
once
at
her
pale
face
while
she
was
speaking
and
then
again
like
her
dropped
his
eyes
on
the
reins
i
must
indeed
thank
you
imma
he
answered
for
speaking
so
earnestly
for
you
know
that
you
do
always
do
so
but
generally
speak
only
derisively
and
in
your
way
take
things
as
little
seriously
as
i
in
mine
how
else
but
derisively
can
i
speak
to
you
prince
and
sometimes
you
are
so
hard
and
cruel
as
for
instance
towards
the
head
sister
in
the
dorothea
hospital
whom
you
threw
into
such
confusion
oh
i
well
aware
that
i
too
have
my
faults
and
need
somebody
to
help
me
to
give
them
up
i
be
that
somebody
imma
we
help
each
other
i
do
think
we
can
help
each
other
prince
yes
we
can
did
you
speak
just
now
quite
seriously
and
unsatirically
but
as
for
me
you
are
not
right
when
you
say
that
i
care
about
nothing
at
all
and
lay
nothing
to
heart
for
i
care
about
you
imma
about
you
i
have
laid
you
to
heart
and
as
this
matter
is
one
of
such
inexpressible
seriousness
to
me
i
can
not
fail
finally
to
win
your
confidence
were
you
aware
of
my
joy
when
i
heard
you
talk
of
putting
yourself
out
and
coming
nearer
to
me
yes
put
yourself
out
a
little
and
do
not
let
yourself
ever
again
be
confused
with
that
sort
of
awkwardness
or
whatever
it
is
which
you
are
so
liable
to
feel
in
my
presence
ah
i
know
it
i
know
only
too
well
how
much
to
blame
i
am
for
that
but
laugh
at
yourself
and
at
me
when
i
make
you
feel
like
that
and
attach
yourself
to
me
will
you
promise
me
to
put
yourself
out
a
little
but
imma
spoelmann
promised
nothing
but
insisted
now
on
her
gallop
and
many
a
subsequent
conversation
remained
like
this
without
result
sometimes
when
klaus
heinrich
had
come
to
tea
the
prince
miss
spoelmann
the
countess
and
percival
went
into
the
park
the
splendid
collie
kept
decorously
at
imma
side
and
countess
löwenjoul
walked
two
or
three
yards
behind
the
young
people
for
soon
after
they
had
started
she
had
stopped
for
a
second
to
twine
her
bent
and
bony
fingers
round
a
blossom
and
she
had
never
made
good
the
distance
she
had
then
lost
so
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
walked
in
front
of
her
and
talked
but
when
they
had
covered
a
certain
distance
they
turned
round
thus
getting
the
countess
two
or
three
yards
in
front
of
them
then
klaus
heinrich
followed
up
his
conversational
efforts
and
carefully
and
without
looking
up
took
imma
spoelmann
small
ringless
hand
from
her
side
and
clasped
it
in
both
his
the
while
he
imploringly
asked
whether
she
was
taking
pains
and
had
made
any
progress
in
her
confidence
in
him
it
displeased
him
to
hear
that
she
had
been
working
poring
over
algebra
and
playing
in
the
lofty
spheres
since
they
had
last
met
he
would
beg
her
to
lay
her
books
aside
now
as
they
might
distract
her
and
divert
her
from
the
matter
to
which
all
her
thinking
powers
must
now
be
devoted
he
talked
also
about
himself
about
that
sobering
effect
and
awkwardness
which
according
to
her
his
existence
inspired
he
tried
to
explain
it
and
in
doing
so
to
weaken
it
he
spoke
about
the
cold
stern
and
barren
existence
which
had
been
his
hitherto
he
described
to
her
how
everybody
had
always
flocked
to
gaze
at
him
while
it
had
been
his
lofty
calling
to
show
himself
and
to
be
gazed
at
a
much
more
difficult
task
he
did
his
best
to
make
her
recognize
that
the
remedy
for
that
which
caused
him
to
prevent
the
poor
countess
from
drivelling
and
to
estrange
her
to
his
own
sorrow
that
this
remedy
could
be
found
in
her
only
in
her
and
was
given
over
absolutely
into
her
hands
she
looked
at
him
her
big
eyes
sparkled
in
dark
scrutiny
and
it
was
clear
that
she
she
too
was
struggling
but
then
she
would
shake
her
head
or
break
off
the
conversation
introducing
with
a
pout
some
topic
over
which
she
made
merry
incapable
of
bringing
herself
to
take
the
responsibility
of
the
yes
for
which
he
begged
her
that
undefined
and
as
matters
stood
absolutely
surrender
she
did
not
prevent
him
from
coming
once
or
twice
a
week
she
did
not
prevent
him
from
speaking
from
assailing
her
with
prayers
and
asseverations
and
from
taking
her
hand
now
and
then
between
his
own
but
she
was
only
patient
she
remained
unmoved
her
dread
of
taking
the
decisive
step
that
aversion
from
leaving
her
cool
and
derisive
kingdom
and
confessing
herself
his
seemed
unconquerable
and
she
could
not
help
in
her
anguish
and
exhaustion
breaking
out
with
the
words
oh
prince
we
ought
never
to
have
met
it
would
have
been
best
if
we
had
then
you
would
have
pursued
your
lofty
calling
as
calmly
as
ever
and
i
should
have
preserved
my
peace
of
mind
and
neither
would
have
harassed
the
other
the
prince
had
much
difficulty
in
inducing
her
to
recant
and
in
extorting
from
her
the
confession
that
she
did
not
entirely
regret
having
made
his
acquaintance
but
all
this
took
time
the
summer
came
to
an
end
early
loosened
the
leaves
from
the
trees
fatma
florian
and
isabeau
hoofs
rustled
in
the
leafage
when
they
went
for
a
ride
autumn
came
with
its
mists
and
sharp
smells
and
nobody
could
have
prophesied
an
end
or
indeed
any
decisive
turn
in
the
course
of
the
strangely
fluctuating
affair
the
credit
of
having
placed
things
on
the
foundation
of
actuality
of
having
given
events
the
lead
in
the
direction
of
a
happy
issue
must
for
ever
be
ascribed
to
the
distinguished
gentleman
who
had
up
till
now
wisely
kept
in
the
background
but
at
the
right
moment
intervened
carefully
but
firmly
i
refer
to
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
minister
of
the
interior
foreign
affairs
and
the
grand
ducal
household
ueberbein
had
been
correct
in
his
assertion
that
the
president
of
the
council
had
kept
himself
posted
in
the
stages
of
klaus
love
affair
what
is
more
well
served
by
intelligent
and
sagacious
assistants
he
had
kept
himself
well
in
touch
with
the
state
of
public
opinion
with
the
rôle
which
samuel
spoelmann
and
his
daughter
played
in
the
imaginative
powers
of
the
people
with
the
royal
rank
with
which
the
popular
idea
invested
them
with
the
great
and
superstitious
tension
with
which
the
population
followed
the
intercourse
between
the
schlosses
hermitage
and
delphinenort
with
the
popularity
of
that
intercourse
in
a
word
he
was
well
aware
how
the
spoelmanns
for
everyone
who
did
not
deliberately
shut
his
eyes
were
the
general
topic
of
conversation
and
rumour
not
only
in
the
capital
but
in
the
whole
country
a
characteristic
incident
was
enough
to
make
herr
knobelsdorff
sure
of
his
ground
at
the
beginning
of
october
the
landtag
had
been
opened
a
fortnight
before
and
the
disputes
with
the
budget
commission
were
in
full
swing
imma
spoelmann
fell
ill
very
seriously
ill
so
it
was
said
at
first
it
seemed
that
the
imprudent
girl
for
some
whim
or
mood
while
out
with
her
countess
had
ventured
on
a
gallop
of
nearly
half
an
duration
on
her
white
fatma
in
the
teeth
of
a
strong
wind
and
had
come
home
with
an
attack
of
congestion
of
the
lungs
which
threatened
to
end
her
altogether
the
news
soon
got
about
people
said
the
girl
was
hovering
between
life
and
death
which
as
luckily
soon
emerged
was
a
great
exaggeration
but
the
consternation
the
general
sympathy
could
not
have
been
greater
if
a
serious
accident
had
happened
to
a
member
of
the
house
of
grimmburg
even
to
the
grand
duke
himself
it
was
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
in
the
humbler
parts
of
the
city
near
the
dorothea
hospital
for
instance
the
women
stood
in
the
evening
outside
their
front
doors
pressed
the
palms
of
their
hands
against
their
breasts
and
coughed
as
if
to
show
each
other
what
it
meant
to
be
short
of
breath
the
evening
papers
published
searching
and
expert
news
of
the
condition
of
miss
spoelmann
which
passed
from
hand
to
hand
were
read
at
family
gatherings
and
cafés
and
were
discussed
in
the
the
reporter
had
been
seen
to
drive
in
a
cab
to
delphinenort
where
in
the
hall
with
the
mosaic
floor
he
had
been
snubbed
by
the
spoelmanns
butler
and
had
talked
english
to
him
though
he
found
that
no
easy
task
the
press
moreover
could
not
escape
the
reproach
of
having
magnified
the
whole
business
and
made
a
quite
unnecessary
fuss
about
it
there
was
absolutely
no
question
of
any
danger
six
days
in
bed
under
the
care
of
the
spoelmanns
private
physician
sufficed
to
relieve
the
congestion
and
to
make
miss
spoelmann
lungs
quite
well
again
but
these
six
days
sufficed
also
to
make
clear
the
importance
which
the
spoelmanns
and
miss
imma
personality
in
particular
had
achieved
in
our
public
opinion
every
morning
found
the
envoys
of
the
newspapers
commissioners
of
the
general
curiosity
gathered
in
the
mosaic
hall
at
delphinenort
to
hear
the
butler
curt
bulletins
which
they
then
reproduced
in
their
papers
at
the
inordinate
length
which
the
public
desired
one
read
of
greetings
and
wishes
for
recovery
sent
to
delphinenort
by
various
benevolent
institutions
which
imma
spoelmann
had
visited
and
richly
subscribed
to
and
the
wits
remarked
that
the
grand
ducal
treasury
might
have
taken
the
opportunity
of
offering
their
homage
in
a
similar
way
the
public
read
also
and
dropped
the
paper
to
exchange
a
significant
look
of
a
beautiful
floral
tribute
which
prince
klaus
heinrich
had
sent
with
his
card
the
truth
being
that
the
prince
so
long
as
miss
spoelmann
kept
to
her
bed
sent
flowers
not
once
but
daily
to
delphinenort
a
fact
which
was
not
mentioned
by
those
in
the
know
so
as
not
to
make
too
great
a
sensation
the
public
read
further
that
the
popular
young
patient
had
left
her
bed
for
the
first
time
and
finally
the
news
came
that
she
was
soon
to
go
out
for
the
first
time
but
this
going
out
which
took
place
on
a
sunny
autumn
morning
eight
days
after
the
patient
had
been
taken
ill
was
calculated
to
give
rise
to
such
an
expression
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
population
as
people
of
stern
labelled
immoderate
for
round
the
spoelmanns
huge
motor
which
with
a
pale
young
chauffeur
of
an
type
on
the
box
waited
in
front
of
the
main
door
at
delphinenort
a
big
crowd
had
gathered
and
when
miss
spoelmann
and
countess
löwenjoul
followed
by
a
lackey
with
a
rug
came
out
cheers
broke
out
hats
and
handkerchiefs
were
waved
until
the
motor
had
forced
a
way
through
the
crowd
and
had
left
the
demonstrators
behind
in
a
cloud
of
vapour
it
must
be
confessed
that
these
consisted
of
those
rather
doubtful
elements
who
usually
collect
on
such
occasions
youths
a
few
women
with
one
or
two
schoolboys
gapers
loafers
and
of
various
descriptions
but
what
is
the
public
and
what
should
its
composition
be
to
make
it
an
average
public
one
further
assertion
must
not
be
passed
over
entirely
in
silence
which
was
later
disseminated
by
the
cynics
it
was
to
the
effect
that
among
the
crowd
round
the
motor
there
was
an
agent
in
herr
von
knobelsdorff
pay
a
member
of
the
secret
police
who
had
started
the
cheers
and
vigorously
kept
them
going
we
can
leave
that
in
doubt
and
not
grudge
the
belittlers
of
important
events
their
satisfaction
at
least
in
the
case
of
this
particular
crowd
it
only
amounts
to
saying
that
the
agent
task
was
the
mechanical
release
of
feelings
which
must
have
been
there
and
must
have
been
vivid
at
any
rate
this
scene
which
of
course
was
described
at
length
in
the
daily
press
did
not
fail
to
impress
everybody
and
persons
with
any
acumen
for
the
connexion
of
things
felt
no
doubt
that
a
further
piece
of
news
which
busied
men
minds
a
few
days
later
stood
in
hidden
relation
to
all
these
phenomena
and
symptoms
the
news
ran
that
his
royal
highness
prince
klaus
heinrich
had
received
his
excellency
the
minister
of
state
von
knobelsdorff
in
audience
at
the
schloss
hermitage
and
had
been
closeted
with
him
from
three
in
the
afternoon
till
seven
in
the
evening
a
whole
four
hours
what
had
they
discussed
surely
not
the
next
court
ball
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
ball
had
been
one
among
several
topics
of
conversation
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
preferred
his
request
for
a
confidential
talk
with
the
prince
in
connexion
with
the
court
hunt
which
had
taken
place
on
october
in
the
woods
to
the
west
near
schloss
jägerpreis
and
in
which
klaus
heinrich
and
his
cousins
dressed
in
green
uniforms
soft
felt
hats
and
and
hung
with
hangers
bandoliers
and
pistol
cases
had
taken
part
herr
von
had
been
consulted
and
three
on
october
decided
on
klaus
heinrich
himself
had
offered
to
visit
the
old
gentleman
at
his
official
residence
but
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
preferred
coming
to
the
hermitage
he
came
punctually
and
was
received
with
all
the
affection
and
warmth
which
klaus
heinrich
thought
that
propriety
demanded
in
the
case
of
the
aged
counsellor
of
his
father
and
his
brother
the
sober
little
room
in
which
stood
the
three
fine
mahogany
empire
with
the
blue
on
the
yellow
ground
was
the
scene
of
the
interview
though
close
on
seventy
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
was
vigorous
both
in
body
and
mind
his
showed
not
one
senile
wrinkle
but
was
tightly
and
well
filled
with
the
compact
and
comfortable
form
of
a
man
of
happy
disposition
his
hair
was
pure
white
like
his
short
moustache
and
parted
smoothly
in
the
middle
his
chin
had
a
sympathetic
pit
in
it
which
might
pass
for
a
dimple
the
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
played
as
livelily
as
ever
indeed
they
had
gained
with
the
years
some
little
branches
and
additional
lines
so
that
the
whole
complication
of
wrinkles
imparted
to
his
blue
eyes
an
expression
of
humorous
subtlety
klaus
heinrich
was
attached
to
herr
von
knobelsdorff
though
no
closer
relations
had
been
established
between
them
the
minister
of
state
had
actually
superintended
and
organized
the
prince
life
he
had
begun
by
fixing
on
dröge
to
be
his
first
tutor
had
then
called
the
pheasantry
into
life
for
him
had
sent
him
later
to
the
university
with
ueberbein
had
also
arranged
his
military
service
for
show
and
had
put
schloss
hermitage
at
his
disposal
to
live
in
but
all
this
he
had
done
at
and
had
rarely
interviewed
him
in
person
indeed
when
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
met
klaus
heinrich
during
those
years
of
education
he
had
inquired
most
respectfully
as
to
the
prince
resolves
and
plans
for
the
future
as
if
he
were
in
complete
ignorance
of
them
and
perhaps
it
was
just
this
fiction
which
was
firmly
bolstered
up
on
both
sides
which
had
kept
their
intercourse
throughout
within
the
bounds
of
formality
herr
von
knobelsdorff
began
the
conversation
in
an
easy
though
respectful
tone
while
klaus
heinrich
tried
to
discover
the
objects
of
his
visit
the
former
then
chatted
about
the
hunt
of
the
day
before
yesterday
made
some
pleasant
reference
to
the
amount
of
ground
they
had
covered
and
then
mentioned
casually
his
admirable
colleague
at
the
treasury
krippenreuther
who
had
also
taken
part
in
the
hunt
and
whose
invalid
appearance
he
regretted
herr
krippenreuther
had
really
not
hit
a
thing
yes
worry
makes
the
hand
unsteady
remarked
herr
von
knobelsdorff
and
so
gave
the
prince
the
cue
for
a
direct
reference
to
this
worry
he
spoke
about
the
by
no
means
trifling
shortage
in
the
estimates
about
the
minister
discussions
with
the
budget
commission
the
new
the
rate
of
per
and
the
bitter
opposition
of
the
urban
deputies
of
the
antediluvian
meat
tax
and
the
civil
service
cries
of
hunger
and
klaus
heinrich
who
had
been
surprised
at
first
by
so
many
dry
facts
listened
to
him
intently
and
nodded
his
head
repeatedly
the
two
men
the
old
and
young
sat
side
by
side
on
a
slender
hardish
sofa
with
yellow
upholstery
and
brass
mountings
which
stood
behind
the
round
table
opposite
the
narrow
glass
door
the
latter
opened
on
to
the
terrace
and
through
it
one
could
see
the
park
and
the
duck
pond
floating
in
the
autumn
mist
the
low
white
smooth
stove
in
which
a
fire
was
crackling
diffused
a
gentle
warmth
through
the
severely
and
scantily
furnished
room
klaus
heinrich
though
not
quite
able
to
follow
the
political
proceedings
yet
proud
and
happy
at
being
so
seriously
talked
to
by
the
experienced
dignitary
felt
his
mood
growing
more
and
more
grateful
and
confidential
herr
von
knobelsdorff
spoke
pleasantly
about
the
most
unpleasant
subjects
his
voice
was
comforting
his
remarks
ably
strung
together
and
insinuating
and
suddenly
klaus
heinrich
became
aware
that
he
had
dropped
the
subject
of
the
state
finances
and
had
passed
on
from
doctor
worries
to
his
klaus
heinrich
own
condition
was
herr
von
knobelsdorff
mistaken
his
eyes
were
beginning
occasionally
to
play
him
tricks
but
he
wished
he
could
think
that
his
royal
highness
looked
a
little
better
fresher
brighter
a
look
of
tiredness
of
worry
was
unmistakable
herr
von
knobelsdorff
feared
to
seem
importunate
but
he
must
hope
that
these
symptoms
did
not
arise
from
any
malady
bodily
or
mental
klaus
heinrich
looked
out
at
the
mist
his
look
was
still
sealed
but
though
he
sat
on
the
hard
sofa
in
his
usual
stiff
upright
attitude
his
feet
crossed
his
right
hand
over
his
left
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
turned
towards
herr
von
knobelsdorff
yet
inwardly
his
stiffness
relaxed
at
this
juncture
and
worn
out
as
he
was
by
his
strangely
ineffectual
struggle
it
did
not
want
much
more
to
make
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
he
was
so
lonely
so
destitute
of
counsellors
ueberbein
had
recently
kept
far
away
from
the
hermitage
klaus
heinrich
merely
said
ah
excellency
that
would
take
us
too
far
but
herr
von
knobelsdorff
answered
too
far
no
your
royal
highness
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
too
prolix
i
confess
that
my
knowledge
of
your
royal
highness
experiences
is
greater
than
i
allowed
to
appear
just
now
your
royal
highness
can
scarcely
have
anything
new
to
tell
me
apart
from
those
refinements
and
details
which
rumour
can
never
collect
but
if
it
might
comfort
your
royal
highness
to
open
his
heart
to
an
old
servant
who
carried
you
in
his
arms
perhaps
i
might
not
be
quite
incapable
of
standing
by
your
royal
highness
in
word
and
deed
and
then
it
happened
that
something
gave
way
in
klaus
heinrich
bosom
and
poured
out
in
a
stream
of
confession
he
told
herr
von
knobelsdorff
the
whole
story
he
told
it
as
one
tells
when
the
heart
is
full
and
everything
comes
tumbling
out
all
at
once
through
the
lips
according
to
no
plan
no
chronological
order
and
with
undue
emphasis
on
unessentials
but
with
a
burst
of
passion
and
with
that
concreteness
which
is
the
product
of
passionate
observation
he
began
in
the
middle
jumped
unexpectedly
to
the
beginning
hurried
on
to
the
conclusion
which
did
not
exist
tumbled
over
himself
and
more
than
once
hesitated
and
stuck
fast
but
herr
von
knobelsdorff
made
the
review
easier
for
him
enabled
him
by
slipping
in
suggestive
questions
to
float
the
ship
again
and
at
last
the
picture
of
klaus
heinrich
experiences
with
all
their
characters
and
leading
actors
with
the
figures
of
samuel
spoelmann
of
the
crazy
countess
löwenjoul
even
of
the
collie
percival
and
especially
that
of
imma
spoelmann
with
all
its
contrariness
lay
there
complete
and
full
ready
to
be
discussed
the
piece
of
was
referred
to
in
full
detail
for
herr
von
knobelsdorff
seemed
to
attach
importance
to
it
nothing
was
omitted
from
the
impressive
incident
at
the
changing
of
the
guard
to
the
last
intimate
and
distressing
struggles
on
horseback
and
on
foot
klaus
heinrich
was
much
wrought
up
when
he
finished
and
his
eyes
in
the
national
were
full
of
tears
he
had
left
the
sofa
thereby
forcing
herr
von
knobelsdorff
also
to
get
up
and
wished
on
account
of
the
heat
to
open
the
glass
door
into
the
little
veranda
but
herr
von
knobelsdorff
stopped
this
by
calling
attention
to
the
risk
of
a
chill
he
begged
the
prince
humbly
to
sit
down
again
as
his
royal
highness
could
not
conceal
from
himself
the
need
for
a
calm
discussion
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
both
sat
down
again
on
the
thinly
cushioned
sofa
herr
von
knobelsdorff
meditated
awhile
and
his
face
was
as
serious
as
it
ever
could
be
with
his
dimpled
chin
and
the
play
of
his
then
breaking
silence
he
thanked
the
prince
with
emotion
for
the
great
honour
he
had
shown
him
by
confiding
in
him
and
in
direct
connexion
with
this
herr
von
knobelsdorff
emphasizing
each
word
announced
that
whatever
attitude
the
prince
had
expected
him
herr
von
knobelsdorff
to
assume
at
this
juncture
he
herr
von
knobelsdorff
was
certainly
not
the
man
to
oppose
the
wishes
and
hopes
of
the
prince
but
much
rather
to
show
his
royal
highness
the
way
to
the
goal
to
the
best
of
his
power
long
silence
ensued
klaus
heinrich
looked
rapturously
at
herr
von
knobelsdorff
eyes
with
the
wrinkles
had
he
these
wishes
and
hopes
was
there
a
goal
he
was
not
sure
of
his
ears
he
said
your
excellency
is
kind
enough
then
herr
von
knobelsdorff
added
to
his
declaration
a
condition
and
said
frankly
on
one
condition
only
did
he
as
first
official
of
the
state
dare
to
exercise
his
modest
influence
on
behalf
of
his
royal
highness
on
one
condition
on
condition
that
your
royal
highness
does
not
take
account
only
of
your
own
happiness
in
a
selfish
and
frivolous
way
but
as
your
lofty
calling
demands
regards
your
personal
destiny
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
mass
the
whole
klaus
heinrich
was
silent
and
his
eyes
were
heavy
in
thought
perhaps
your
royal
highness
continued
herr
von
knobelsdorff
after
a
pause
will
allow
me
to
leave
this
delicate
and
yet
quite
unavoidable
topic
for
a
while
and
to
turn
to
more
general
matters
this
is
the
hour
of
confidence
and
mutual
understanding
i
respectfully
beg
to
be
allowed
to
take
advantage
of
it
your
royal
highness
is
through
your
exalted
position
cut
off
from
rude
actuality
severed
from
it
by
delicate
precautions
i
shall
not
forget
that
this
actuality
is
not
or
only
at
a
matter
for
your
royal
highness
and
yet
the
moment
seems
to
me
to
have
come
for
bringing
at
least
a
certain
portion
of
this
rude
world
to
the
immediate
notice
of
your
royal
highness
entirely
for
your
own
sake
i
plead
beforehand
for
forgiveness
if
i
chance
to
stir
up
your
royal
highness
emotions
too
harshly
by
what
i
tell
you
please
speak
on
excellency
said
klaus
heinrich
hastily
involuntarily
he
sat
upright
just
as
one
sits
up
straight
in
a
dentist
chair
and
collects
one
natural
powers
to
withstand
an
attack
of
pain
i
must
ask
for
your
undivided
attention
said
herr
von
knobelsdorff
almost
sternly
and
then
as
a
corollary
to
the
discussions
with
the
budget
commission
followed
the
statement
the
clear
exhaustive
unembroidered
lesson
well
primed
with
figures
and
explanations
of
the
fundamental
facts
and
technical
expressions
which
showed
the
economical
position
of
the
country
the
state
and
brought
our
whole
miserable
plight
with
relentless
clearness
before
the
prince
eyes
naturally
these
things
were
not
entirely
new
and
strange
to
him
indeed
ever
since
he
had
assumed
his
representative
rôle
they
had
served
as
a
motive
and
subject
for
those
formal
questions
which
he
used
to
address
to
burgomasters
agriculturists
and
high
officials
and
to
which
he
received
answers
which
were
merely
answers
and
nothing
more
and
which
were
often
accompanied
by
the
smile
which
he
had
known
all
his
life
and
which
reminded
him
that
he
was
born
to
be
king
but
all
this
had
not
yet
forced
itself
upon
him
in
its
naked
actuality
nor
made
serious
claims
on
his
thinking
powers
herr
von
knobelsdorff
was
by
no
means
satisfied
to
get
a
few
of
klaus
heinrich
usual
encouraging
words
he
pressed
the
matter
home
he
the
young
man
made
him
repeat
whole
sentences
he
kept
him
relentlessly
to
the
point
and
reminded
the
prince
of
a
dry
and
skinny
which
stopped
at
each
separate
place
and
would
not
go
on
until
convinced
that
the
pupil
really
understood
the
lesson
herr
von
knobelsdorff
began
at
the
rudiments
and
talked
about
the
country
and
its
lack
of
development
from
a
commercial
and
industrial
point
of
view
he
talked
about
the
people
klaus
heinrich
people
that
shrewd
and
honest
sound
and
reliable
stock
he
spoke
about
the
deficiency
in
the
state
reserves
the
poor
dividends
paid
by
the
railways
the
insufficient
coal
supply
he
touched
on
the
administration
of
the
forests
game
preserves
and
he
talked
about
the
woods
the
excessive
felling
the
immoderate
stripping
of
litter
the
crippling
of
the
industry
the
falling
revenues
from
the
forests
then
he
went
more
closely
into
our
stock
of
gold
discussed
the
natural
inability
of
the
people
to
pay
heavy
taxes
described
the
reckless
finance
of
earlier
periods
thereupon
he
added
up
the
figures
of
the
state
debt
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
forced
the
prince
to
repeat
several
times
they
reached
six
hundred
millions
the
lesson
extended
further
to
the
debentures
conditions
for
interest
and
repayment
it
came
back
to
doctor
krippenreuther
present
anxiety
and
described
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
suddenly
pulling
the
annual
of
the
statistical
bureau
out
of
his
pocket
herr
von
knobelsdorff
instructed
his
pupil
in
the
harvest
returns
for
the
previous
years
summed
up
the
untoward
events
which
had
caused
their
decline
pointed
to
the
deficiencies
in
the
taxes
the
figures
of
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
referred
to
the
underfed
adults
and
children
whom
one
might
see
throughout
the
then
he
turned
to
the
general
condition
of
the
gold
market
discoursed
on
the
rise
in
the
value
of
gold
and
the
general
economic
unsoundness
klaus
heinrich
learned
also
about
the
lowness
of
the
exchange
the
restlessness
of
the
creditors
the
leakage
of
gold
and
the
bank
smashes
he
saw
our
credit
shaken
our
paper
valueless
and
grasped
to
the
full
that
the
raising
of
a
new
loan
was
almost
impossible
the
night
was
closing
in
it
was
long
past
five
when
herr
von
knobelsdorff
ended
his
statement
of
the
national
economics
at
this
time
klaus
heinrich
usually
had
his
tea
but
this
time
he
only
gave
a
passing
thought
to
it
and
nobody
outside
dared
to
disturb
a
conversation
whose
importance
was
shown
by
its
duration
klaus
heinrich
listened
and
listened
he
scarcely
realized
how
much
affected
he
was
but
how
could
the
other
bring
himself
to
say
all
that
to
him
he
had
not
called
him
royal
highness
one
single
time
during
the
interview
he
had
to
some
extent
forced
him
and
grossly
ignored
the
fact
that
he
was
born
to
be
king
and
yet
it
was
good
and
stimulating
to
hear
all
that
and
to
have
to
bury
oneself
in
it
for
reality
sake
he
forgot
to
have
the
lights
brought
his
attention
was
so
much
occupied
it
was
these
circumstances
concluded
herr
von
knobelsdorff
which
i
had
in
mind
when
i
begged
your
royal
highness
to
regard
your
personal
wishes
and
plans
continually
in
the
light
of
the
general
good
i
have
no
doubt
that
your
royal
highness
will
profit
by
this
talk
and
by
the
facts
i
have
been
bold
enough
to
put
before
you
and
in
this
connexion
i
beg
your
royal
highness
to
allow
me
to
revert
to
your
more
personal
case
herr
von
knobelsdorff
waited
till
klaus
heinrich
had
made
a
sign
of
consent
with
his
hand
and
then
went
on
if
this
affair
is
to
have
any
future
it
is
desirable
that
it
should
now
advance
a
step
in
its
development
it
is
stagnating
it
remains
as
formless
and
prospectless
as
the
mist
outside
that
intolerable
we
must
give
it
form
must
thicken
it
out
must
mark
its
outlines
more
clearly
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
quite
so
quite
so
give
it
form
thicken
it
out
that
it
that
absolutely
necessary
agreed
klaus
heinrich
so
much
excited
that
he
left
the
sofa
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
but
how
for
heaven
sake
excellency
tell
me
how
the
next
external
step
said
herr
von
knobelsdorff
and
remained
sitting
so
unusual
was
the
occasion
must
be
this
that
the
spoelmanns
be
seen
at
court
klaus
heinrich
stopped
still
no
he
said
never
if
i
know
spoelmann
will
he
let
himself
be
persuaded
to
go
to
court
which
answered
herr
von
knobelsdorff
does
prevent
his
daughter
from
doing
us
this
pleasure
the
court
ball
not
so
very
far
off
it
rests
with
you
royal
highness
to
induce
miss
spoelmann
to
take
part
in
it
her
companion
is
a
countess
a
peculiar
one
perhaps
but
a
countess
and
that
helps
things
when
i
assure
your
royal
highness
that
the
court
will
not
fail
to
make
things
easy
i
am
speaking
with
the
approbation
of
the
chief
master
of
the
ceremonies
herr
von
bühl
zu
bühl
the
conversation
now
turned
for
of
an
hour
on
questions
of
precedence
and
the
ceremonial
conditions
under
which
the
presentation
must
be
carried
out
the
distribution
of
cards
was
always
left
to
princess
catherine
mistress
of
the
robes
a
widowed
countess
trümmerhauff
who
led
the
ladies
world
at
the
festivities
in
the
old
castle
but
as
to
the
act
of
presentation
itself
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
managed
to
secure
some
concessions
of
a
deliberate
in
fact
definite
character
there
was
no
american
consul
in
the
place
no
reason
on
that
account
explained
herr
von
knobelsdorff
for
letting
the
ladies
be
presented
by
any
casual
chamberlain
no
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
himself
requested
the
honour
of
presenting
them
to
the
grand
duke
when
at
what
point
of
the
prescribed
procession
why
undoubtedly
unusual
circumstances
demand
exceptions
in
the
first
place
then
in
front
of
all
the
débutantes
of
the
various
ranks
klaus
heinrich
might
assure
miss
spoelmann
that
this
would
be
arranged
it
would
give
rise
to
talk
and
sensation
at
court
and
in
the
city
but
never
mind
so
much
the
better
sensation
was
by
no
means
undesirable
sensation
was
useful
even
necessary
herr
von
knobelsdorff
went
it
had
become
so
dark
when
he
took
his
leave
that
the
prince
and
he
could
scarcely
see
each
other
klaus
heinrich
who
now
first
became
aware
of
it
excused
himself
in
some
confusion
but
herr
von
knobelsdorff
declared
it
to
be
a
matter
of
no
importance
in
what
sort
of
light
a
conversation
like
that
was
carried
on
he
took
the
hand
which
klaus
heinrich
offered
him
and
grasped
it
in
both
his
never
he
said
warmly
and
these
were
his
last
words
before
he
went
never
was
the
happiness
of
a
prince
more
inseparable
from
that
of
his
people
no
whatever
your
royal
highness
ponders
and
does
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
the
happiness
of
your
royal
highness
by
the
disposition
of
destiny
has
become
a
condition
of
the
public
weal
but
that
your
royal
highness
on
your
side
must
recognize
in
the
weal
of
your
country
the
indispensable
condition
and
justification
of
your
own
happiness
much
moved
and
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
arrange
the
thoughts
which
poured
in
on
him
in
thousands
klaus
heinrich
remained
behind
in
his
homely
empire
room
he
passed
a
restless
night
and
went
next
morning
despite
misty
and
damp
weather
for
a
long
and
lonely
ride
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
talked
clearly
and
voluminously
had
given
and
accepted
facts
but
for
the
fusion
modelling
and
working
up
of
these
multifarious
raw
products
he
had
given
only
curt
aphoristic
instructions
and
klaus
heinrich
found
himself
doomed
to
some
heavy
thinking
while
he
lay
awake
at
night
and
later
when
he
went
for
a
ride
on
florian
when
he
got
back
to
the
hermitage
he
did
a
remarkable
thing
he
wrote
with
a
pencil
on
a
piece
of
paper
an
order
a
certain
commission
and
sent
neumann
the
valet
with
it
to
the
academy
bookshop
in
the
university
strasse
neumann
came
back
with
a
package
of
books
which
klaus
heinrich
had
set
out
in
his
room
and
which
he
began
at
once
to
read
they
were
works
of
a
sober
and
appearance
with
glazed
paper
backs
ugly
leather
sides
and
coarse
paper
and
the
contents
were
divided
up
minutely
into
sections
main
divisions
and
paragraphs
their
titles
were
not
stimulating
they
were
manuals
and
of
economy
abstracts
and
outlines
of
state
finance
systematic
treatises
on
political
economy
the
prince
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
with
these
books
and
gave
instructions
that
he
wished
on
no
account
to
be
disturbed
the
autumn
was
damp
and
klaus
heinrich
felt
little
tempted
to
leave
the
hermitage
on
saturday
he
drove
to
the
old
schloss
to
give
free
audiences
otherwise
his
time
was
his
own
all
this
week
and
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
it
wrapped
in
his
he
sat
in
the
warmth
of
the
low
stove
at
his
small
desk
and
pored
over
his
books
on
finance
with
his
temples
resting
in
his
hands
he
read
about
the
state
expenditure
and
what
it
always
consisted
of
about
the
receipts
and
whence
they
flowed
in
when
things
were
going
well
he
ploughed
through
the
whole
subject
of
taxation
in
all
its
branches
he
buried
himself
in
the
doctrine
of
the
budget
of
the
balance
of
the
surplus
and
particularly
of
the
deficit
he
lingered
longest
over
and
went
deepest
into
the
public
debt
and
its
varieties
into
loans
and
relation
between
interest
and
capital
and
liquidation
and
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
head
from
the
book
and
dreamed
with
a
smile
about
what
he
had
read
as
if
it
had
been
the
gayest
poetry
for
the
rest
he
found
that
it
was
not
hard
to
grasp
it
all
when
one
set
one
mind
to
it
no
this
really
serious
actuality
in
which
he
now
played
a
part
this
simple
and
rude
texture
of
interests
this
system
of
logical
needs
and
necessities
which
countless
young
men
of
ordinary
birth
had
to
stuff
into
their
heads
to
be
able
to
pass
examinations
in
it
it
was
by
no
means
so
difficult
to
get
hold
of
as
he
in
his
highness
had
thought
the
rôle
of
representation
in
his
opinion
was
harder
and
much
much
more
ticklish
and
difficult
were
his
gentle
struggles
with
imma
spoelmann
on
horseback
and
on
foot
his
studies
made
him
warm
and
happy
he
felt
that
his
zeal
was
making
his
cheeks
hot
like
those
of
his
zu
over
his
peat
after
thus
giving
the
facts
which
he
had
learnt
from
herr
von
knobelsdorff
a
general
academic
basis
and
also
accomplishing
a
feat
of
hard
thinking
in
bringing
together
inward
connexions
and
weighing
possibilities
he
again
presented
himself
at
delphinenort
at
the
lights
in
the
candelabra
with
the
lions
feet
and
the
big
crystal
lustres
were
burning
in
the
garden
room
the
ladies
were
alone
klaus
heinrich
first
asked
after
spoelmann
health
and
indisposition
he
upbraided
her
freely
for
her
strange
impetuosity
to
which
she
answered
with
a
pout
that
as
far
as
she
knew
she
was
her
own
mistress
and
could
do
as
she
liked
with
her
health
the
conversation
then
turned
to
the
autumn
to
the
damp
weather
which
forbade
rides
to
the
advanced
time
of
year
and
the
proximity
of
winter
and
klaus
heinrich
suddenly
mentioned
the
court
ball
in
connexion
with
which
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
whether
the
ladies
if
unfortunately
spoelmann
were
prevented
by
the
state
of
his
health
would
not
care
to
take
part
in
one
this
time
but
when
imma
answered
no
really
she
had
no
wish
to
be
rude
but
she
had
absolutely
not
the
faintest
desire
to
go
to
a
court
ball
he
did
not
press
the
point
but
postponed
the
question
for
the
time
what
had
he
done
these
last
few
days
oh
he
been
very
busy
he
might
say
that
he
been
with
work
doubtless
he
meant
the
court
hunt
at
jägerpreis
the
court
hunt
no
he
had
gone
in
for
real
study
which
he
had
by
no
means
got
to
the
bottom
of
yet
on
the
contrary
he
was
sticking
deep
in
the
literature
on
the
subject
and
klaus
heinrich
began
to
talk
about
his
ugly
books
his
peeps
into
financial
science
and
he
spoke
with
such
pleasure
and
respect
of
this
discipline
that
imma
spoelmann
looked
at
him
with
her
big
eyes
but
when
almost
timidly
she
questioned
him
as
to
the
motive
and
impulse
for
this
activity
he
answered
that
it
was
living
only
too
burning
questions
of
the
day
which
had
brought
him
to
it
circumstances
and
conditions
which
were
certainly
not
well
suited
for
a
cheerful
talk
at
tea
this
remark
obviously
offended
imma
spoelmann
on
what
observations
she
asked
sharply
wagging
her
head
from
side
to
side
did
he
base
his
conviction
that
she
was
approachable
only
or
preferably
by
way
of
cheerful
conversation
and
she
commanded
him
rather
than
asked
him
to
be
kind
enough
to
explain
about
the
burning
questions
of
the
day
then
klaus
heinrich
explained
what
he
had
learnt
from
herr
von
knobelsdorff
and
talked
about
the
land
and
its
state
he
was
well
posted
on
every
point
at
which
the
skinny
had
paused
he
talked
about
the
natural
and
the
indebted
the
general
and
the
particular
the
inherited
and
the
intensifying
misfortunes
he
emphasized
particularly
the
figures
of
the
state
debt
and
the
burden
they
laid
on
our
national
economy
they
were
six
hundred
millions
and
he
did
not
forget
to
mention
the
underfed
peasants
in
the
he
did
not
speak
connectedly
imma
spoelmann
interrupted
him
with
questions
and
helped
him
on
with
questions
she
listened
carefully
and
asked
for
explanations
of
what
she
did
not
at
once
understand
dressed
in
her
dress
with
the
broad
embroidery
on
the
yoke
an
chain
round
her
neck
she
sat
leaning
on
one
elbow
over
the
table
her
chin
buried
in
her
ringless
hand
and
listened
with
her
whole
soul
while
her
big
dark
eyes
scrutinized
the
prince
face
but
while
he
spoke
in
answer
to
imma
verbal
and
ocular
questions
worked
at
his
subject
grew
excited
and
entirely
absorbed
in
it
countess
löwenjoul
no
longer
felt
herself
restricted
to
sober
clarity
by
his
presence
but
let
herself
go
and
indulged
in
the
luxury
of
drivelling
all
the
misery
she
explained
with
dignified
gestures
even
the
bad
harvest
the
burden
of
debt
and
the
rise
in
the
price
of
gold
were
due
to
the
shameless
women
who
swarmed
everywhere
and
unfortunately
had
discovered
the
way
through
the
floor
as
last
night
the
wife
of
a
sergeant
from
the
grenadiers
barracks
had
scratched
her
breasts
and
pommelled
her
in
a
horrible
way
then
she
alluded
to
her
schlosses
in
burgundy
through
the
roofs
of
which
the
rain
came
and
went
so
far
as
to
relate
that
she
had
gone
as
lieutenant
in
an
expedition
against
the
turks
on
which
she
had
been
the
only
one
who
had
not
lost
her
head
imma
spoelmann
and
klaus
heinrich
threw
her
a
kind
word
now
and
then
readily
promised
to
call
her
frau
meier
in
future
and
for
the
rest
took
no
notice
of
her
the
cheeks
of
both
were
burning
when
klaus
heinrich
had
said
all
he
knew
even
on
miss
spoelmann
usually
cheeks
there
was
a
shade
of
red
to
be
seen
they
then
stopped
the
countess
too
kept
quiet
with
her
little
head
inclined
on
her
shoulder
and
staring
into
vacancy
klaus
heinrich
played
on
the
white
and
sharply
folded
with
the
stem
of
an
orchid
which
had
stood
in
a
glass
by
his
plate
but
as
soon
as
he
raised
his
head
he
met
imma
spoelmann
large
flaming
eyes
which
spoke
a
message
of
secret
entreaty
across
the
table
a
darkly
eloquent
language
it
has
been
nice
she
said
in
her
broken
voice
when
she
said
this
time
and
he
felt
her
small
soft
hands
clasp
his
with
a
firm
squeeze
next
time
your
highness
honours
our
unworthy
house
do
bring
me
one
or
two
of
those
excellent
books
you
have
bought
she
could
not
entirely
resist
mocking
him
but
she
asked
him
for
his
finance
books
and
he
brought
them
to
her
he
brought
her
two
of
them
which
he
considered
the
most
informative
and
comprehensive
he
brought
them
some
days
later
in
his
carriage
through
the
damp
town
garden
and
she
thanked
him
for
doing
so
as
soon
as
tea
was
over
they
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
there
while
the
countess
absently
continued
sitting
at
the
they
began
their
common
studies
in
chairs
at
a
gilt
table
bending
over
the
first
page
of
a
manual
called
the
science
of
finance
they
even
read
the
headings
to
the
sections
each
reading
a
sentence
softly
in
turn
for
imma
spoelmann
insisted
on
going
methodically
to
work
and
beginning
at
the
beginning
klaus
heinrich
well
prepared
as
he
was
acted
as
guide
through
the
paragraphs
and
nobody
could
have
followed
more
smartly
or
than
imma
it
quite
easy
she
said
and
looked
up
with
a
laugh
i
surprised
that
it
is
at
bottom
so
simple
algebra
is
much
harder
prince
but
as
they
went
so
deeply
into
things
they
did
not
get
far
in
one
afternoon
so
made
a
mark
in
the
book
at
which
to
start
next
time
and
so
they
went
on
and
the
prince
visits
to
delphinenort
were
devoted
to
dull
realities
whenever
spoelmann
did
not
come
to
tea
or
with
watercloose
left
them
after
eating
his
rusk
imma
and
klaus
heinrich
sat
down
at
the
gilt
table
with
their
books
and
plunged
heads
together
into
the
science
of
economics
but
as
they
progressed
they
compared
what
they
learned
with
the
reality
applied
what
they
read
to
the
circumstances
of
the
country
as
klaus
heinrich
conceived
them
to
be
and
made
their
studies
profitable
though
it
happened
not
seldom
that
their
investigations
were
interrupted
by
considerations
of
a
personal
kind
it
seems
then
said
imma
that
the
issue
may
be
effected
either
directly
or
indirectly
yes
that
obvious
either
the
state
turns
directly
to
the
capitalists
and
opens
a
subscription
list
your
hand
is
twice
as
broad
as
mine
she
said
look
prince
and
they
looked
laughingly
at
their
hands
his
right
and
her
left
as
they
lay
next
each
other
on
the
gilt
table
or
went
on
imma
the
loan
is
procured
by
negotiation
and
it
is
some
big
bank
or
group
of
banks
to
which
the
state
wait
he
said
softly
wait
imma
and
answer
me
one
question
you
missing
the
main
point
are
you
making
progress
what
about
the
disenchantment
and
embarrassment
dear
little
imma
have
you
now
just
one
spark
of
confidence
in
me
his
lips
asked
the
question
close
to
her
hair
from
which
a
delicate
fragrance
arose
and
she
held
her
dark
head
still
and
bent
over
the
book
though
she
did
not
answer
his
question
frankly
but
must
it
be
a
bank
or
group
of
banks
she
pondered
nothing
about
it
there
i
ca
think
it
would
be
necessary
in
practice
she
spoke
gravely
and
deliberately
on
these
occasions
for
she
too
for
her
part
had
to
grapple
with
the
mental
exercises
which
klaus
heinrich
had
successfully
managed
after
the
conversation
with
herr
von
knobelsdorff
and
when
some
weeks
later
he
repeated
his
question
whether
she
would
not
like
to
go
to
the
court
ball
and
told
her
of
the
ceremonial
conditions
which
had
been
sanctioned
for
this
occasion
behold
she
replied
that
she
would
like
to
and
would
go
next
day
with
countess
löwenjoul
and
leave
cards
on
the
widowed
countess
trümmerhauff
this
year
the
court
ball
took
place
earlier
than
usual
at
the
end
of
november
an
arrangement
which
was
said
to
be
due
to
the
wishes
of
the
grand
ducal
party
herr
von
bühl
zu
bühl
bitterly
bewailed
this
precipitation
which
obliged
him
and
his
subordinates
to
cancel
the
arrangements
for
the
most
important
court
function
especially
the
improvements
which
the
gala
rooms
in
the
old
schloss
so
much
needed
but
the
wish
of
the
particular
member
of
the
grand
ducal
family
had
had
the
support
of
herr
von
knobelsdorff
and
the
court
marshal
had
to
give
way
but
it
happened
thus
that
people
minds
scarcely
had
time
to
prepare
themselves
sufficiently
for
what
really
was
the
event
of
the
evening
in
comparison
with
which
the
unusual
date
seemed
as
nothing
indeed
when
the
published
in
leaded
type
the
news
of
the
leaving
of
cards
and
the
invitation
not
without
expressing
in
rather
smaller
type
and
in
glowing
words
its
satisfaction
thereat
and
welcoming
daughter
to
the
court
the
important
evening
was
already
close
at
hand
and
before
tongues
could
get
fairly
wagging
the
whole
thing
was
a
completed
reality
never
had
more
envy
attached
to
the
five
hundred
favoured
ones
whose
names
stood
on
the
court
ball
list
never
had
the
bourgeois
more
eagerly
devoured
the
account
in
the
those
dazzling
columns
which
were
written
every
year
by
a
nobleman
who
had
degenerated
through
drink
and
which
were
such
glorious
reading
that
one
felt
they
gave
one
a
peep
into
fairyland
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
ball
in
the
old
schloss
went
off
quite
modestly
and
soberly
but
the
report
only
extended
to
the
supper
including
the
french
menu
and
everything
that
came
later
especially
all
the
delicate
significance
of
the
great
occasion
were
necessarily
left
to
be
reported
by
word
of
mouth
the
ladies
in
a
huge
motor
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
albrechtstor
at
the
old
schloss
fairly
punctually
though
not
so
punctually
that
herr
von
bühl
zu
bühl
had
not
had
time
to
get
anxious
from
a
seven
onwards
he
had
waited
in
full
uniform
covered
with
orders
down
to
his
waist
with
a
bright
brown
toupée
and
his
gold
on
his
nose
in
the
middle
of
the
knights
hall
where
the
grand
ducal
family
and
the
chief
officials
were
collected
standing
now
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
and
every
now
and
then
dispatching
a
footman
to
the
ballroom
to
find
out
whether
miss
spoelmann
had
not
yet
come
he
thought
of
all
sorts
of
possibilities
if
this
queen
of
sheba
came
too
late
and
what
might
one
not
expect
of
a
girl
who
had
walked
right
through
the
guard
the
entry
of
the
grand
ducal
cortège
would
have
to
be
delayed
and
the
court
would
have
to
wait
for
her
for
she
simply
must
be
introduced
first
and
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
enter
the
ballroom
after
the
grand
duke
but
thank
heaven
a
bare
minute
before
seven
she
arrived
with
her
countess
and
it
made
a
great
sensation
when
the
chamberlains
who
received
them
arranged
them
next
the
diplomats
and
so
in
front
of
the
nobility
the
court
ladies
the
ministers
the
generals
the
presidents
of
chambers
and
all
the
court
world
von
platow
had
fetched
the
grand
duke
from
his
rooms
albrecht
in
hussar
uniform
had
greeted
the
members
of
his
house
with
eyes
in
the
hall
had
offered
his
arm
to
aunt
catherine
and
then
after
herr
von
bühl
had
tapped
three
times
with
his
staff
on
the
parquet
in
the
open
doors
the
procession
of
the
court
into
the
ballroom
had
begun
asserted
later
that
the
general
inattention
had
verged
on
the
scandalous
during
the
perambulation
of
the
grand
duke
as
albrecht
reached
successive
spots
with
his
dignified
aunt
a
hasty
bowing
and
billowing
without
the
fitting
composure
ensued
but
otherwise
all
faces
were
turned
to
one
point
only
in
the
ball
all
eyes
directed
with
burning
curiosity
on
this
point
alone
she
who
stood
yonder
had
had
enemies
in
the
hall
at
least
among
the
women
the
female
trümmerhauffs
prenzlaus
wehrzahns
and
platows
who
were
plying
their
fans
here
and
sharp
and
cold
female
glances
had
scrutinized
her
but
whether
her
position
was
now
too
well
established
for
criticism
to
venture
to
assail
her
or
her
personality
itself
had
conquered
the
secret
opposition
all
had
declared
with
one
voice
that
imma
spoelmann
was
as
fine
as
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
the
whole
town
the
clerk
in
the
government
office
the
messenger
at
the
street
corner
knew
her
toilette
by
heart
next
morning
it
had
been
a
gown
of
crêpe
de
chine
with
silver
embroidery
and
priceless
old
silver
lace
on
the
bodice
a
tiara
of
diamonds
had
glittered
in
her
dark
hair
which
showed
a
tendency
to
fall
in
smooth
wisps
across
her
forehead
and
a
long
hanging
chain
of
the
same
stones
was
wound
two
or
three
times
round
her
brown
throat
small
and
yet
strangely
earnest
and
with
her
pale
face
and
big
strangely
speaking
eyes
she
had
stood
in
her
place
of
honour
by
the
side
of
countess
löwenjoul
who
had
been
dressed
in
brown
as
usual
though
this
time
in
satin
when
the
cortège
reached
her
she
had
with
a
kind
of
coy
pertness
made
a
suggestion
of
a
curtsey
without
completing
it
but
when
prince
klaus
heinrich
with
the
yellow
ribbon
and
the
flat
chain
of
the
family
order
for
constancy
over
his
tunic
the
silver
star
of
the
grimmburg
griffin
on
his
chest
and
his
anæmic
cousin
on
his
arm
whose
conversation
was
limited
to
yes
passed
by
her
directly
after
the
grand
duke
she
had
smiled
with
closed
lips
and
nodded
to
him
like
a
comrade
which
sent
something
like
a
quiver
through
the
company
then
after
the
diplomats
had
been
received
by
the
grand
ducal
party
the
presentations
had
begun
begun
with
imma
spoelmann
although
there
had
been
two
countess
hundskeels
and
one
baroness
von
among
the
débutantes
with
an
ingratiating
smile
which
showed
his
false
teeth
herr
von
bühl
had
presented
daughter
to
his
master
and
albrecht
sucking
his
lower
lip
against
his
upper
had
looked
down
on
her
coy
from
which
she
had
raised
herself
to
scrutinize
with
her
speaking
eyes
the
suffering
hussar
colonel
in
his
silent
pride
the
grand
duke
had
addressed
several
questions
to
her
an
exception
to
an
otherwise
strict
rule
he
had
asked
her
how
her
father
was
what
effect
the
ditlinde
spa
had
and
how
she
liked
on
the
whole
being
with
us
questions
which
she
had
answered
in
her
broken
voice
with
a
pout
and
a
wag
of
her
dark
head
then
after
a
pause
a
pause
perhaps
of
internal
struggle
albrecht
had
expressed
his
pleasure
at
seeing
her
at
court
whereupon
countess
löwenjoul
had
executed
her
curtsey
with
an
evasive
glance
from
her
eyes
this
scene
imma
spoelmann
in
the
presence
of
albrecht
long
remained
the
favourite
topic
of
conversation
and
although
it
had
passed
as
it
was
bound
to
pass
without
anything
unusual
happening
yet
its
charm
and
importance
must
not
be
overlooked
it
was
not
indeed
the
climax
of
the
evening
that
in
the
eyes
of
many
was
the
quadrille
in
the
eyes
of
others
the
supper
in
reality
however
it
was
a
secret
duologue
between
the
two
chief
actors
in
the
piece
a
short
unnoticed
exchange
of
words
whose
contents
and
actual
result
the
public
could
only
guess
the
settlement
of
certain
tender
struggles
on
horseback
and
on
foot
as
to
the
quadrille
there
were
people
who
declared
next
day
that
miss
spoelmann
had
danced
in
it
with
prince
klaus
heinrich
as
her
partner
only
the
first
part
of
this
story
was
correct
miss
spoelmann
had
taken
part
in
the
solemn
dance
but
as
the
british
consul
partner
and
prince
klaus
heinrich
this
was
fairly
strong
but
what
was
still
stronger
was
that
the
majority
of
the
guests
did
not
consider
it
an
thing
but
on
the
contrary
almost
a
matter
of
course
yes
imma
spoelmann
position
was
established
the
popular
conception
of
her
personality
as
the
public
learned
next
day
had
prevailed
in
the
court
ballroom
and
what
is
more
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
taken
care
that
this
conception
should
be
expressed
with
all
the
publicity
he
thought
desirable
not
with
distinctive
or
aggressive
respect
no
imma
spoelmann
had
been
treated
ceremoniously
and
at
the
same
time
with
systematic
intentional
emphasis
the
two
masters
of
the
ceremonies
on
duty
chamberlains
in
rank
had
introduced
selected
dancers
to
her
and
when
she
had
left
her
place
close
by
the
low
red
platform
where
the
grand
ducal
family
sat
on
damask
chairs
to
dance
with
her
partners
they
had
busied
themselves
just
as
when
the
princesses
danced
in
clearing
her
a
space
under
the
chandelier
in
the
middle
and
protecting
her
from
collisions
an
easy
task
in
any
case
for
a
protective
circle
of
curiosity
had
formed
round
her
when
she
danced
it
was
reported
that
when
prince
klaus
heinrich
asked
miss
spoelmann
for
the
first
time
a
deep
drawing
of
breath
a
formal
sh
of
excitement
had
been
heard
in
the
ballroom
and
the
masters
of
the
ceremonies
had
found
it
difficult
to
keep
the
ball
going
and
to
prevent
the
whole
company
standing
round
the
dancers
in
gaping
curiosity
the
women
especially
had
watched
the
pair
with
an
excited
delight
which
had
miss
spoelmann
position
been
only
a
little
weaker
would
undoubtedly
have
taken
on
the
form
of
rage
and
malice
but
the
pressure
and
influence
of
public
feeling
that
powerful
inspiration
from
below
had
worked
too
powerfully
on
every
one
of
the
five
hundred
guests
for
them
to
be
able
to
regard
this
spectacle
through
any
eyes
other
than
those
of
the
people
it
did
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
the
prince
to
impose
any
restraint
upon
himself
his
name
shortened
to
appeared
twice
on
miss
spoelmann
programme
and
besides
he
had
sat
out
several
other
dances
with
her
they
had
danced
yonder
her
brown
arm
had
rested
on
the
ribbon
that
crossed
his
shoulder
and
his
right
arm
had
encircled
her
light
and
figure
while
as
usual
when
he
danced
he
had
placed
the
left
on
his
hip
and
guided
his
partner
with
one
hand
only
with
one
hand
when
came
a
further
article
in
the
ceremonial
conditions
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
contrived
for
imma
spoelmann
visit
to
court
came
into
staggering
force
it
was
the
article
which
dealt
with
the
order
of
seating
at
the
table
for
while
the
majority
of
the
guests
supped
at
long
tables
in
the
picture
gallery
and
in
the
hall
of
the
twelve
months
supper
was
laid
in
the
silver
hall
for
the
grand
ducal
family
diplomats
and
leading
court
officials
in
solemn
procession
as
when
they
entered
the
ballroom
albrecht
and
his
party
entered
the
punctually
at
eleven
and
imma
spoelmann
passed
by
the
lackeys
who
kept
the
doors
and
repelled
the
uninvited
on
the
arm
of
the
british
consul
and
entered
the
silver
hall
to
take
her
place
at
the
grand
ducal
table
that
was
unheard
of
and
at
the
same
time
after
all
that
had
gone
before
so
logically
consequential
that
any
surprise
or
disgust
would
have
been
idiotic
the
motto
for
the
day
was
to
be
prepared
for
anything
in
the
way
of
omens
and
phenomena
but
after
supper
when
the
grand
duke
had
withdrawn
and
princess
griseldis
had
opened
the
cotillon
with
a
chamberlain
expectation
was
again
raised
to
fever
point
for
the
general
question
was
had
the
prince
been
allowed
to
present
miss
spoelmann
with
a
bouquet
his
instructions
had
obviously
been
not
to
give
her
the
first
he
had
first
given
one
each
to
his
aunt
catherine
and
a
cousin
but
he
had
then
advanced
towards
imma
spoelmann
with
a
bouquet
of
lilac
from
the
court
gardens
as
she
was
about
to
raise
the
lovely
bunch
to
her
nose
she
had
hesitated
for
some
unknown
reason
with
a
look
of
apprehension
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
encouraged
her
with
a
laugh
and
a
nod
that
she
decided
to
test
the
fragrance
of
the
bouquet
then
they
had
danced
and
chatted
quietly
together
for
a
long
time
and
yet
it
was
during
this
dance
that
that
unnoticed
duologue
that
conversation
of
a
palpably
bourgeois
tenor
and
practical
result
had
taken
place
and
this
is
what
it
was
are
you
satisfied
this
time
imma
with
the
flowers
i
bring
you
of
course
prince
your
lilac
is
lovely
and
smells
quite
as
it
should
i
love
it
really
imma
but
i
sorry
for
the
poor
down
in
the
court
because
its
roses
disgust
you
with
their
mouldy
smell
i
wo
say
that
they
disgust
me
prince
but
they
disenchant
and
chill
you
do
they
yes
perhaps
but
have
i
ever
told
you
of
the
popular
belief
that
the
will
one
day
be
redeemed
on
a
day
of
general
happiness
and
will
bear
roses
which
will
add
to
their
great
beauty
the
gift
of
a
lovely
natural
scent
well
prince
we
have
to
wait
for
that
no
imma
we
must
help
and
act
we
must
decide
and
have
done
with
all
hesitation
little
imma
tell
me
tell
me
have
you
confidence
in
me
yes
prince
i
have
gained
confidence
in
you
latterly
there
you
are
thank
heaven
did
i
say
that
i
must
succeed
in
the
long
run
and
so
you
think
now
that
i
am
in
earnest
real
serious
earnest
about
you
and
about
us
yes
prince
latterly
i
have
thought
that
i
can
think
so
at
last
at
last
irresolute
little
imma
oh
how
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
but
in
that
case
you
not
afraid
and
will
let
the
whole
world
know
that
you
belong
to
me
let
them
know
that
you
belong
to
me
royal
highness
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
that
i
will
imma
loudly
and
surely
but
only
on
one
condition
namely
that
we
do
only
think
of
our
own
happiness
in
a
selfish
and
frivolous
way
but
regard
it
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
mass
the
whole
for
the
public
weal
and
our
happiness
you
see
are
interdependent
well
said
prince
for
without
our
studies
of
the
public
weal
i
should
have
found
it
difficult
to
decide
to
have
confidence
in
you
and
without
you
imma
to
warm
my
heart
i
should
have
found
it
difficult
to
tackle
such
practical
problems
right
then
we
see
what
we
can
do
each
in
our
own
place
you
with
your
folk
and
i
with
my
father
little
sister
he
answered
quietly
and
pressed
her
more
closely
to
him
in
the
dance
little
bride
undoubtedly
a
peculiar
plighting
of
troth
to
be
frank
everything
was
not
yet
settled
or
nearly
settled
looking
back
one
must
say
that
if
one
factor
in
the
whole
had
been
altered
or
removed
the
whole
would
have
been
in
imminent
danger
of
coming
to
nothing
what
a
blessing
the
chronicler
feels
tempted
to
cry
what
a
blessing
that
there
was
a
man
at
the
head
of
affairs
who
faced
the
music
firmly
and
undaunted
indeed
not
without
a
dash
of
rashness
and
did
not
judge
a
thing
to
be
impossible
just
because
it
had
never
happened
before
the
conversation
which
excellency
von
knobelsdorff
had
about
eight
days
after
the
memorable
court
ball
with
grand
duke
albrecht
ii
in
the
old
schloss
belongs
to
the
history
of
the
times
the
day
before
the
president
of
council
had
presided
over
a
session
of
the
cabinet
about
which
the
had
been
in
the
position
to
report
that
questions
of
finance
and
the
private
affairs
of
the
grand
ducal
family
had
been
discussed
and
further
added
the
newspaper
in
spaced
type
that
complete
unanimity
of
opinion
had
been
reached
among
the
ministers
so
herr
von
knobelsdorff
found
himself
in
a
strong
position
towards
his
young
monarch
at
the
audience
for
he
had
not
only
the
swarming
mass
of
the
people
but
also
the
unanimous
will
of
the
government
at
his
back
the
conversation
in
albrecht
draughty
study
took
scarcely
less
time
than
that
in
the
little
yellow
room
at
schloss
hermitage
a
pause
was
made
while
the
grand
duke
had
a
lemonade
and
herr
von
knobelsdorff
a
glass
of
port
and
biscuits
the
long
duration
of
the
conversation
was
due
only
to
the
importance
of
the
material
to
be
discussed
not
to
the
monarch
opposition
for
albrecht
raised
none
in
his
close
with
his
thin
sensitive
hands
crossed
on
his
lap
his
proud
refined
head
with
its
pointed
beard
and
narrow
temples
raised
and
his
eyelids
sunk
he
sucked
gently
with
his
lower
lip
against
his
upper
and
accompanied
herr
von
knobelsdorff
remarks
with
an
occasional
slight
nod
which
expressed
agreement
and
disagreement
at
the
same
time
an
uninterested
formal
agreement
without
prejudice
to
his
unassailable
personal
dignity
herr
von
knobelsdorff
plunged
straight
into
the
middle
of
things
and
spoke
about
prince
klaus
heinrich
visits
to
schloss
delphinenort
albrecht
knew
of
them
a
subdued
echo
of
the
events
which
kept
the
city
and
the
country
on
had
penetrated
even
into
his
loneliness
he
knew
too
his
brother
klaus
heinrich
who
had
rummaged
and
gossiped
with
the
lackeys
and
then
he
knocked
his
forehead
against
the
big
table
had
wept
for
sympathy
with
his
forehead
and
in
effect
he
needed
no
coaching
lisping
and
reddening
slightly
he
gave
herr
von
knobelsdorff
to
understand
this
and
added
that
seeing
that
the
other
had
not
intervened
but
had
caused
the
millionaire
daughter
to
be
introduced
to
him
he
concluded
that
herr
von
knobelsdorff
approved
of
the
prince
behaviour
although
he
the
grand
duke
could
not
clearly
see
what
it
would
lead
to
the
government
answered
herr
von
knobelsdorff
would
set
itself
in
prejudicial
and
estranging
opposition
to
the
will
of
the
people
if
it
thwarted
the
prince
projects
has
my
brother
then
definite
projects
for
a
long
time
corrected
herr
von
knobelsdorff
he
acted
without
any
plan
and
merely
as
his
heart
dictated
but
since
he
has
found
himself
with
the
people
on
terms
of
reality
his
wishes
have
taken
a
practical
form
all
of
which
means
that
the
public
approves
the
steps
taken
by
the
prince
that
it
acclaims
them
royal
highness
that
its
dearest
hopes
are
fixed
on
them
and
now
herr
von
knobelsdorff
unrolled
once
more
the
dark
picture
of
the
state
of
the
country
of
its
distress
of
the
serious
embarrassment
where
was
a
remedy
to
be
found
yonder
only
yonder
in
the
town
park
in
the
second
centre
of
the
city
in
the
house
of
the
invalid
our
guest
and
resident
round
whose
person
the
people
wove
their
dreams
and
for
whom
it
would
be
a
small
matter
to
put
an
end
to
all
our
difficulties
it
he
could
be
induced
to
take
upon
himself
our
national
finances
their
recovery
would
be
assured
would
he
be
induced
but
fate
had
ordained
an
exchange
of
sympathy
between
the
mighty
only
daughter
and
prince
klaus
heinrich
and
was
this
wise
and
gracious
ordinance
to
be
flouted
ought
one
for
the
sake
of
mulish
traditions
to
prevent
a
union
which
embraced
so
immeasurable
a
blessing
for
the
country
and
its
people
for
that
it
did
was
a
necessary
hypothesis
from
which
the
union
must
draw
its
justification
and
validity
but
if
this
condition
were
fulfilled
if
samuel
spoelmann
were
ready
not
to
mince
words
to
finance
the
state
then
this
union
was
not
only
admissible
it
was
necessary
it
was
salvation
the
welfare
of
the
state
demanded
it
and
prayers
rose
to
heaven
for
it
far
beyond
the
frontiers
wherever
any
interest
was
felt
in
the
restoration
of
our
finances
and
the
avoidance
of
an
economic
panic
at
this
point
the
grand
duke
asked
a
question
quietly
with
a
mocking
smile
and
without
looking
up
and
the
succession
to
the
throne
he
asked
the
law
answered
herr
von
knobelsdorff
unshaken
places
it
in
your
royal
highness
hand
to
put
aside
dynastic
scruples
with
us
the
grant
of
an
advance
in
rank
and
even
of
equal
birth
belongs
to
the
prerogatives
of
the
monarch
and
when
could
history
show
a
more
potent
motive
for
the
exercise
of
these
privileges
this
union
bears
the
mark
of
its
own
genuineness
preparations
have
been
long
in
making
for
its
reception
in
the
heart
of
the
people
and
your
entire
princely
and
state
approval
would
signify
to
the
people
nothing
more
than
an
outward
satisfaction
of
their
inmost
convictions
and
herr
von
knobelsdorff
went
on
to
speak
of
imma
popularity
of
the
significant
demonstration
in
connexion
with
her
recovery
from
a
slight
indisposition
of
the
position
of
equal
birth
which
this
exceptional
person
assumed
in
popular
fancy
and
the
wrinkles
played
round
his
eyes
as
he
reminded
albrecht
of
the
old
prophecy
current
among
the
people
which
told
of
a
prince
who
would
give
the
country
more
with
one
hand
than
others
had
given
it
with
two
and
eloquently
demonstrated
how
the
union
between
klaus
heinrich
and
spoelmann
daughter
must
seem
to
the
people
the
fulfilment
of
the
oracle
and
thus
god
will
and
right
and
proper
herr
von
knobelsdorff
said
a
great
deal
more
which
was
clever
honest
and
good
he
alluded
to
the
fourfold
mixture
of
blood
in
imma
spoelmann
for
besides
the
portuguese
and
german
some
drops
of
ancient
indian
blood
were
said
to
flow
in
her
veins
and
emphasized
the
fact
that
he
expected
the
dynasty
to
benefit
greatly
by
the
quickening
effect
of
the
mixture
of
races
on
ancient
stocks
but
the
artless
old
gentleman
made
his
greatest
effect
when
he
talked
about
the
huge
and
beneficial
alterations
which
would
be
caused
in
the
economical
state
of
the
court
itself
our
and
court
through
the
heir
to
the
throne
bold
marriage
it
was
at
this
point
that
albrecht
sucked
most
proudly
at
his
upper
lip
the
value
of
gold
was
falling
the
were
increasing
increasing
in
pursuance
of
an
economic
law
which
held
for
the
court
finances
just
as
much
as
for
every
private
household
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
increasing
the
revenues
but
it
was
not
right
that
the
monarch
means
should
be
inferior
to
those
of
many
of
his
subjects
it
was
from
the
monarch
point
of
view
intolerable
that
unschlitt
house
should
have
had
central
heating
a
long
time
ago
but
that
the
old
schloss
should
not
have
got
it
yet
a
remedy
was
necessary
in
more
than
one
way
and
lucky
was
the
princely
house
to
which
so
grand
a
remedy
as
this
offered
itself
it
was
noteworthy
in
our
times
that
all
the
modesty
as
to
busying
oneself
in
the
financial
concerns
of
the
court
had
vanished
that
with
which
princely
families
used
formerly
to
make
the
heaviest
sacrifices
so
as
to
keep
the
public
from
disenchanting
glimpses
into
their
financial
affairs
was
no
longer
to
be
found
and
and
questionable
sales
were
the
order
of
the
day
but
was
not
an
alliance
with
sovereign
riches
preferable
to
this
petty
and
bourgeois
kind
of
device
a
union
which
would
exalt
the
monarch
for
ever
high
above
all
economic
worries
and
place
him
in
a
position
to
reveal
himself
to
the
people
with
all
those
outward
signs
for
which
they
longed
so
ran
herr
von
knobelsdorff
questions
which
he
himself
answered
with
an
unqualified
yes
in
short
his
speech
was
so
clever
and
so
irresistible
that
he
did
not
leave
the
old
schloss
without
taking
with
him
consents
and
authorizations
delivered
to
him
with
a
proud
lisp
which
were
quite
comprehensive
enough
to
warrant
unprecedented
conclusions
if
only
miss
spoelmann
had
done
her
share
and
so
things
ran
their
memorable
course
to
a
happy
conclusion
even
before
the
end
of
december
names
were
mentioned
of
people
who
had
seen
not
only
heard
tell
of
lord
marshal
von
bühl
zu
bühl
in
a
fur
coat
a
on
his
brown
head
and
his
gold
on
his
nose
get
out
of
a
court
carriage
at
delphinenort
at
on
a
morning
and
disappear
waddling
into
the
schloss
at
the
beginning
of
january
there
were
individuals
going
about
the
town
who
swore
that
the
man
who
this
time
also
in
the
morning
and
in
fur
coat
and
had
passed
by
the
grinning
negro
in
plush
through
the
door
of
delphinenort
and
with
feverish
haste
had
flung
himself
into
a
cab
which
was
waiting
for
him
was
undoubtedly
our
finance
minister
krippenreuther
and
at
the
same
time
there
appeared
in
the
the
first
preparatory
notices
of
rumours
touching
an
impending
betrothal
in
the
grand
ducal
house
tentative
notifications
which
becoming
carefully
clearer
and
clearer
at
last
exhibited
the
two
names
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
spoelmann
in
clear
print
next
each
other
it
was
no
new
collocation
but
to
see
it
in
black
on
white
had
the
same
effect
as
strong
wine
it
was
most
absorbing
to
notice
what
attitude
in
the
journalistic
discussions
which
ensued
our
enlightened
and
press
took
up
towards
the
popular
aspect
of
the
affair
namely
the
prophecy
which
had
won
too
great
political
significance
not
to
demand
education
and
intelligence
to
deal
satisfactorily
with
it
chiromancy
and
similar
magic
explained
the
were
so
far
as
the
destiny
of
individuals
was
concerned
to
be
relegated
to
the
murky
regions
of
superstition
they
belonged
to
the
grey
middle
ages
and
no
ridicule
was
too
severe
for
the
idiots
who
very
rarely
in
the
cities
nowadays
let
experienced
empty
their
purses
in
return
for
reading
from
their
hands
the
cards
or
their
insignificant
fortunes
or
for
invoking
sound
health
for
a
homoeopathic
cure
or
for
freeing
their
sick
cattle
from
invading
demons
as
if
the
apostle
had
not
already
asked
doth
god
take
care
for
oxen
but
surveyed
as
a
whole
and
restricted
to
decisive
turns
in
the
destiny
of
whole
nations
or
dynasties
the
proposition
did
not
necessarily
repel
a
and
scientific
mind
that
as
time
is
only
an
illusion
and
truly
viewed
all
happenings
are
stationary
in
eternity
such
revolutions
while
still
in
the
lap
of
the
future
might
give
the
human
brain
a
premonitory
shock
and
reveal
themselves
palpably
to
it
and
in
proof
of
this
the
zealous
newspaper
published
an
exhaustive
composition
kindly
put
at
its
disposal
by
one
of
our
professors
which
gave
a
conspectus
of
all
the
cases
in
the
history
of
mankind
in
which
oracle
and
horoscope
somnambulism
clairvoyance
dreams
and
inspiration
had
played
a
rôle
a
most
meritorious
production
which
produced
the
due
effect
in
cultured
circles
so
press
government
court
and
public
closed
their
ranks
in
complete
understanding
and
assuredly
the
would
have
held
its
tongue
had
its
philosophical
contributions
been
premature
and
politically
dangerous
at
that
time
in
a
word
had
not
the
negotiations
at
delphinenort
already
advanced
far
in
a
favourable
direction
it
is
pretty
accurately
known
by
now
how
these
negotiations
developed
and
what
a
difficult
indeed
painful
task
our
counsel
had
in
them
the
counsel
to
whom
as
proxy
of
the
court
the
delicate
mission
had
fallen
of
preparing
the
way
for
prince
klaus
heinrich
courtship
as
well
as
the
chief
financial
assessor
who
notwithstanding
his
infirm
state
of
health
insisted
on
nursing
his
country
interests
by
a
personal
interview
with
samuel
spoelmann
in
this
connexion
account
must
be
taken
firstly
of
spoelmann
fiery
and
excitable
disposition
and
secondly
of
the
fact
that
to
the
prodigious
little
man
a
favourable
termination
to
the
business
from
our
point
of
view
seemed
far
less
important
than
it
did
to
us
apart
from
spoelmann
love
for
his
daughter
who
had
opened
her
heart
to
him
and
told
him
of
her
pretty
wish
to
make
herself
useful
in
her
love
our
proxies
had
not
one
trump
to
play
against
him
and
he
was
the
last
man
to
whom
krippenreuther
could
dictate
conditions
in
virtue
of
what
herr
von
bühl
had
to
offer
spoelmann
always
spoke
of
prince
klaus
heinrich
as
the
young
man
and
expressed
so
little
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
giving
his
daughter
to
a
royal
highness
to
wife
that
krippenreuther
as
well
as
herr
von
bühl
were
more
than
once
plunged
into
deadly
embarrassment
if
he
only
learnt
something
had
some
respectable
business
he
snarled
peevishly
but
a
young
man
who
only
knows
how
to
get
cheered
he
was
really
furious
the
first
time
a
remark
was
dropped
about
morganatic
marriage
his
daughter
he
declared
once
for
all
was
no
concubine
and
would
be
no
wife
who
marries
her
marries
her
but
the
interests
of
the
dynasty
and
the
country
coincided
at
this
point
with
his
own
the
obtaining
of
issue
entitled
to
succeed
was
a
necessity
and
herr
von
bühl
was
equipped
with
all
the
powers
which
herr
von
knobelsdorff
had
succeeded
in
extracting
from
the
grand
duke
as
for
krippenreuther
mission
however
it
owed
its
success
not
to
the
envoy
eloquence
but
simply
to
spoelmann
paternal
affection
the
complaisance
of
a
suffering
weary
father
whose
abnormal
existence
had
long
ago
made
him
a
paradox
towards
his
only
daughter
and
heiress
whom
he
allowed
to
choose
for
herself
the
public
funds
in
which
she
wished
to
invest
her
fortune
and
so
came
into
existence
the
agreements
which
were
at
first
shrouded
in
deep
secrecy
and
only
came
to
light
bit
by
bit
as
events
developed
themselves
though
here
they
can
be
summarized
in
a
few
plain
words
the
betrothal
of
klaus
heinrich
with
imma
spoelmann
was
approved
and
recognized
by
samuel
spoelmann
and
by
the
house
of
grimmburg
simultaneously
with
the
publication
of
the
betrothal
in
the
appeared
the
announcement
of
the
elevation
of
the
bride
to
the
rank
of
countess
under
a
fancy
name
of
romantic
sound
like
that
which
klaus
heinrich
had
borne
during
his
educational
tour
in
the
fair
southern
lands
and
on
the
day
of
their
wedding
the
wife
of
the
was
to
be
given
the
dignity
of
a
princess
the
two
rises
in
rank
which
might
have
cost
four
thousand
eight
hundred
marks
were
to
be
free
of
duty
the
wedding
was
to
be
only
preliminarily
a
one
till
the
world
had
got
used
to
it
for
on
the
day
on
which
it
appeared
that
the
bride
was
to
be
blessed
with
offspring
albrecht
ii
in
view
of
the
unparalleled
circumstances
would
declare
his
brother
morganatic
wife
to
be
of
equal
birth
and
would
give
her
the
rank
of
a
princess
of
the
grand
ducal
house
with
the
title
of
royal
highness
the
new
member
of
the
ruling
house
would
waive
all
claim
to
an
appanage
as
for
the
court
ceremony
only
a
was
appointed
for
the
celebration
of
the
marriage
but
a
processional
court
that
highest
and
completest
form
of
showing
allegiance
was
fixed
for
the
celebration
of
the
declaration
of
equal
birth
samuel
spoelmann
for
his
part
granted
the
state
a
loan
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
million
marks
and
on
such
fatherly
conditions
that
the
loan
showed
all
the
symptoms
of
being
a
gift
it
was
the
grand
duke
albrecht
who
acquainted
the
heir
presumptive
with
these
conclusions
once
more
klaus
heinrich
stood
in
the
great
draughty
study
under
the
battered
in
front
of
his
brother
as
once
before
when
albrecht
had
delegated
to
him
his
representative
duties
and
standing
in
an
official
attitude
received
the
great
news
he
had
put
on
the
tunic
of
a
major
in
the
fusiliers
of
the
guard
for
this
audience
while
the
grand
duke
had
lately
added
to
his
black
a
pair
of
wool
mittens
which
his
aunt
had
made
him
to
protect
him
from
the
draught
through
the
high
windows
of
the
old
schloss
when
albrecht
had
finished
klaus
heinrich
stepped
one
pace
sideways
closed
his
heels
with
a
fresh
salute
and
said
i
beg
dear
albrecht
to
offer
my
and
respectful
thanks
in
my
own
name
and
that
of
the
whole
country
for
it
is
you
in
the
long
run
who
make
all
these
blessings
possible
and
the
redoubled
love
of
the
people
will
be
your
reward
for
your
magnanimous
resolutions
he
pressed
his
brother
thin
sensitive
hand
which
he
kept
close
to
his
chest
and
extended
to
him
only
to
the
extent
of
moving
his
forearm
the
grand
duke
had
thrust
forward
his
short
round
underlip
and
his
eyelids
were
he
answered
softly
with
a
lisp
i
am
the
less
inclined
to
entertain
illusions
about
the
people
love
as
i
can
as
you
know
dispense
with
such
questionable
love
without
a
pang
so
question
whether
i
deserve
it
is
scarcely
worth
notice
when
it
time
to
start
i
go
to
the
station
and
give
the
signal
to
the
which
is
silly
rather
than
dutiful
but
it
my
duty
but
you
in
a
different
position
you
a
sunday
child
everything
turns
out
trumps
for
you
i
wish
you
luck
he
said
raising
the
lids
from
his
blue
eyes
and
it
was
clear
at
this
moment
that
he
loved
klaus
heinrich
i
wish
you
happiness
klaus
heinrich
but
not
too
much
and
that
you
may
not
repose
too
comfortably
in
the
love
of
the
people
i
have
already
said
that
everything
turns
out
trumps
for
you
the
girl
of
your
choice
is
very
strange
very
undomesticated
and
most
important
of
all
very
original
she
has
a
mixture
of
blood
i
been
told
that
indian
blood
flows
in
her
veins
that
perhaps
a
good
thing
with
a
wife
like
that
there
less
danger
perhaps
of
your
having
too
easy
a
time
neither
happiness
said
klaus
heinrich
nor
the
people
love
will
have
the
effect
of
making
me
cease
to
be
your
brother
he
left
to
face
a
difficult
interview
a
with
spoelmann
his
personal
proposal
for
imma
hand
he
found
he
had
to
swallow
what
his
negotiators
had
swallowed
for
samuel
spoelmann
showed
not
the
smallest
pleasure
and
snarled
several
refreshing
truths
at
him
but
it
was
over
at
last
and
the
morning
came
when
the
betrothal
appeared
in
the
the
long
tensions
resolved
into
endless
jubilation
dignified
men
waved
at
one
another
and
embraced
in
the
open
square
bunting
flew
from
every
but
the
same
day
the
news
reached
schloss
hermitage
that
raoul
ueberbein
had
committed
suicide
the
story
was
a
vile
as
well
as
stupid
one
and
would
not
be
worth
relating
had
not
its
end
been
so
horrible
no
attempt
will
be
made
here
to
apportion
the
blame
the
doctor
death
gave
rise
to
two
opposing
factions
one
affirmed
that
he
had
been
driven
to
take
his
life
owing
to
the
misgivings
which
his
desperate
act
had
evoked
the
others
declared
with
a
shrug
that
his
conduct
was
impossible
and
crazy
and
that
he
had
shown
all
his
life
a
total
lack
of
the
point
need
not
be
decided
at
any
rate
nothing
justified
so
tragic
an
end
indeed
a
man
with
the
gifts
of
raoul
ueberbein
deserved
something
better
than
ruin
here
is
the
story
at
easter
the
year
before
the
professor
in
charge
of
the
top
class
but
one
at
our
grammar
school
who
suffered
from
had
been
temporarily
retired
on
the
ground
of
his
illness
and
doctor
ueberbein
notwithstanding
his
comparative
youth
had
been
given
the
first
vacant
chair
simply
in
view
of
his
professional
zeal
and
his
undeniably
remarkable
success
in
a
lower
class
it
was
a
happy
experiment
as
events
proved
the
class
had
never
done
so
well
as
this
year
the
professor
on
leave
a
popular
man
with
his
colleagues
had
become
a
peevish
as
well
as
careless
and
indolent
man
as
the
result
of
his
infirmity
with
which
was
combined
a
sociable
but
immoderate
inclination
for
beer
he
had
shut
his
eyes
to
details
and
had
sent
up
every
year
an
extremely
badly
prepared
batch
of
pupils
into
the
select
a
new
spirit
had
come
into
the
class
with
the
temporary
professor
and
nobody
was
surprised
at
it
people
knew
his
uncomfortable
professional
zeal
his
and
energy
they
foresaw
that
he
would
not
miss
such
an
opportunity
for
round
which
he
had
doubtless
built
ambitious
hopes
so
an
end
had
soon
been
put
to
laziness
and
boredom
in
the
second
class
ueberbein
had
pitched
his
expectations
high
and
his
skill
in
inspiring
even
the
most
recalcitrant
had
proved
irresistible
the
boys
worshipped
him
his
superior
fatherly
and
jolly
swaggering
way
kept
them
on
the
alert
shook
them
up
and
made
them
feel
it
a
point
of
honour
to
follow
their
teacher
through
thick
and
thin
he
won
their
hearts
by
going
for
sunday
excursions
with
them
when
they
were
allowed
to
smoke
while
he
bewitched
their
imaginations
by
boyishly
conceived
rodomontades
about
the
greatness
and
severity
of
public
life
and
on
monday
the
members
of
yesterday
expedition
would
meet
for
work
in
a
cheerful
and
eager
frame
of
mind
of
the
school
year
had
thus
passed
when
the
news
went
round
before
christmas
that
the
professor
on
leave
now
fairly
strong
again
would
resume
his
duties
after
the
holidays
and
would
again
act
as
professor
of
the
second
class
and
now
it
came
out
what
sort
of
man
doctor
ueberbein
was
with
his
green
complexion
and
superior
manner
he
objected
and
remonstrated
he
lodged
a
vigorous
and
in
form
not
incontestable
protest
against
the
class
with
which
he
had
spent
of
the
year
and
whose
work
and
recreation
he
had
shared
up
to
the
very
mouth
of
the
goal
being
taken
from
its
professor
for
the
last
quarter
and
restored
to
the
official
who
had
spent
of
the
year
on
leave
his
action
was
intelligible
and
comprehensible
and
one
must
sympathize
with
it
he
had
undoubtedly
hoped
to
send
up
a
model
class
to
the
head
master
who
taught
the
select
a
class
whose
forwardness
would
put
his
skill
in
the
best
light
and
would
hasten
his
promotion
and
it
must
grieve
him
to
look
forward
to
another
reaping
the
fruits
of
his
devotion
but
though
his
disgust
might
be
excusable
his
frenzy
was
not
and
it
is
an
unfortunate
fact
that
when
the
head
master
proved
deaf
to
his
representations
he
became
simply
frenzied
he
lost
his
head
he
lost
all
balance
he
set
heaven
and
hell
to
work
to
prevent
this
loafer
this
this
as
he
did
not
hesitate
to
describe
the
professor
on
leave
from
taking
his
class
from
him
and
when
he
found
no
support
among
his
colleagues
as
was
natural
in
the
case
of
so
unsociable
a
man
the
poor
wretch
had
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
incite
the
pupils
entrusted
to
him
to
rebel
he
had
put
the
question
to
them
from
his
desk
whom
do
you
want
for
your
master
for
the
last
quarter
me
or
that
other
fellow
and
wound
up
by
his
stirring
appeal
they
had
shouted
that
they
wanted
him
then
he
said
they
must
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
show
their
colours
and
act
as
one
boy
though
goodness
knows
what
in
his
excitement
he
meant
by
that
but
when
after
the
holidays
the
returned
professor
entered
the
they
screamed
doctor
ueberbein
name
at
him
for
minutes
on
end
and
there
was
a
fine
scandal
it
was
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
the
revolutionaries
got
off
almost
unpunished
as
doctor
ueberbein
himself
put
on
record
at
the
inquiry
which
was
at
once
initiated
his
appeal
to
them
as
to
the
doctor
himself
too
the
authorities
seemed
generally
inclined
to
close
their
eyes
to
what
had
happened
his
zeal
and
skill
were
highly
valued
certain
learned
works
the
fruits
of
his
mighty
industry
had
made
his
name
known
he
was
popular
in
high
quarters
quarters
be
it
noticed
with
which
he
personally
did
not
come
into
contact
and
which
therefore
he
could
not
incense
by
his
patronizing
bearing
further
his
record
as
tutor
of
prince
klaus
heinrich
weighed
in
the
scales
in
short
he
was
not
simply
dismissed
as
one
might
have
expected
him
to
be
the
president
of
the
grand
ducal
council
of
education
before
whom
the
matter
came
administered
a
grave
reprimand
to
him
and
doctor
ueberbein
who
had
stopped
teaching
directly
after
the
scandal
was
provisionally
retired
but
people
who
knew
declared
later
that
nothing
was
intended
beyond
the
professor
transfer
to
another
grammar
school
that
in
high
quarters
the
only
wish
was
to
hush
up
the
whole
business
and
that
the
promise
of
a
brilliant
future
had
been
actually
extended
to
the
doctor
everything
would
have
turned
out
all
right
but
the
milder
the
authorities
showed
themselves
towards
the
doctor
the
more
hostile
was
the
attitude
of
his
colleagues
towards
him
the
teachers
union
at
once
established
a
court
of
honour
whose
object
was
to
secure
satisfaction
for
their
beloved
member
the
professor
rejected
of
his
pupils
the
written
statement
laid
before
ueberbein
in
his
retirement
in
his
lodgings
ran
as
follows
whereas
ueberbein
had
resisted
the
return
of
the
colleague
for
whom
he
acted
to
the
professorship
of
the
second
class
whereas
further
he
had
agitated
against
him
and
in
the
end
had
actually
incited
the
pupils
to
insubordination
against
him
he
had
been
guilty
of
disloyal
conduct
to
his
colleague
of
such
a
kind
as
must
be
considered
dishonourable
not
only
in
a
professional
but
also
in
a
general
sense
that
was
the
verdict
the
expected
result
was
that
doctor
ueberbein
who
had
only
been
a
nominal
member
of
the
teachers
union
withdrew
his
membership
and
there
so
many
thought
he
might
well
have
let
the
matter
rest
but
whether
it
was
that
in
his
seclusion
he
did
not
know
the
goodwill
he
inspired
in
higher
quarters
that
he
thought
his
prospects
more
hopeless
than
they
were
that
he
could
not
stand
idleness
unreconciled
as
he
was
to
the
premature
loss
of
his
beloved
class
that
the
expression
dishonourable
poisoned
his
blood
or
that
his
mind
was
not
strong
enough
to
stand
all
the
shocks
it
received
at
this
time
five
weeks
after
the
new
year
his
landlady
found
him
on
the
carpet
of
his
room
no
greener
than
usual
but
with
a
bullet
through
his
heart
such
was
the
end
of
raoul
ueberbein
such
his
false
step
such
the
cause
of
his
fall
i
told
you
so
was
the
burden
of
all
the
discussions
of
his
pitiful
the
quarrelsome
and
uncongenial
man
who
had
never
been
a
man
amongst
men
at
his
club
who
had
haughtily
resisted
familiarity
and
had
ordered
his
life
with
a
view
to
results
alone
and
had
supposed
that
that
gave
him
the
right
to
patronize
the
whole
world
there
he
lay
now
the
first
hitch
the
first
obstacle
in
the
field
of
accomplishment
had
brought
him
to
a
miserable
end
few
of
the
bourgeois
regretted
none
of
them
mourned
him
with
one
single
exception
the
chief
surgeon
at
the
dorothea
hospital
ueberbein
congenial
friend
and
perhaps
a
fair
lady
with
whom
he
used
once
to
play
casino
but
klaus
heinrich
always
cherished
an
honourable
and
cordial
memory
of
his
tutor
ix
the
and
spoelmann
financed
the
state
the
outlines
of
the
transaction
were
bold
and
clear
a
child
could
have
understood
them
and
as
a
fact
beaming
fathers
explained
it
to
their
children
as
they
dangled
them
on
their
knees
samuel
spoelmann
nodded
phlebs
and
slippers
got
to
work
and
his
mighty
orders
flashed
under
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
to
the
continent
of
the
western
hemisphere
he
withdrew
a
third
of
his
share
from
the
sugar
trust
a
quarter
from
the
petroleum
trust
and
half
from
the
steel
trust
he
had
his
floating
capital
paid
in
to
accounts
in
his
name
in
several
banks
over
here
and
he
bought
from
herr
krippenreuther
at
par
new
per
cent
consols
at
one
stroke
that
is
what
spoelmann
did
he
who
knows
by
experience
the
influence
of
the
state
of
mind
on
the
human
organs
will
believe
that
krippenreuther
cheered
up
and
in
a
short
time
was
unrecognizable
he
carried
himself
upright
and
free
his
walk
was
springy
the
yellow
look
faded
from
his
face
which
became
red
and
white
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
stomach
regained
its
powers
in
a
few
months
to
such
an
extent
that
his
friends
were
delighted
to
observe
that
the
minister
could
give
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
blue
cabbage
and
gherkin
salad
with
impunity
that
was
one
pleasant
though
purely
personal
result
of
spoelmann
interference
in
our
finances
which
was
of
but
slight
account
in
comparison
with
the
effects
which
that
interference
had
on
our
public
and
economic
life
a
part
of
the
loan
was
devoted
to
the
sinking
fund
and
troublesome
public
debts
were
paid
off
but
this
was
scarcely
needed
to
secure
us
breathing
space
and
credit
on
every
side
for
no
sooner
was
it
known
for
all
the
secrecy
with
which
the
matter
was
treated
officially
that
samuel
spoelmann
had
become
the
state
banker
in
fact
if
not
in
name
than
the
skies
cleared
up
above
us
and
all
our
need
was
changed
into
joy
and
rapture
there
was
an
end
to
the
of
active
debts
the
customary
rate
of
interest
dropped
our
written
promises
were
eagerly
sought
after
as
investments
and
each
hours
saw
a
rise
in
the
quotation
of
our
loan
from
a
deplorably
low
figure
up
to
above
par
the
pressure
the
nightmare
which
for
decades
had
weighed
down
our
national
finances
was
removed
doctor
krippenreuther
puffed
out
his
chest
and
spoke
in
the
landtag
in
favour
of
reduction
in
taxation
this
was
adopted
unanimously
and
the
antediluvian
meat
tax
was
finally
buried
amid
the
rejoicings
of
all
those
who
cared
for
their
a
distinct
improvement
in
the
pay
of
the
civil
service
and
in
the
salaries
of
teachers
clergymen
and
all
state
functionaries

readily
voted

now
available
for
restarting
the
several

given

were
unexpectedly
struck

showed
gratitude
towards
their
rulers
who
had
brought
so
boundless
a
blessing
to

herr

to
increase

for

grand
cross
of

albrechts
order
in
brilliants
the
finance
minister
was
also
ennobled
and
herr
von
knobelsdorff
was
made
happy
with
a
portrait
of
the
exalted
couple
painted
by
the
skilful
hand
of
old
professor
von
lindemann
and
exquisitely
framed
after
the
betrothal
the
people
gave
rein
to
their
fancy
in
calculating
the
dowry
which
imma
spoelmann
was
to
receive
from
her
father
it
made
them
giddy
they
were
possessed
by
a
mad
desire
to
scatter
figures
of
truly
astronomical
dimensions
about
but
the
dowry
did
not
exceed
an
earthly
figure
comfortably
big
though
it
was
it
amounted
to
a
hundred
million
gracious
said
ditlinde
zu
when
she
first
heard
it
and
my
dear
philipp
with
his
peat
many
another
had
the
same
thought
but
spoelmann
daughter
allayed
the
nervous
anger
which
might
arise
in
simple
hearts
in
face
of
such
monstrous
wealth
for
she
did
not
forget
to
do
good
and
share
her
good
fortune
and
on
the
very
day
of
the
public
betrothal
she
gave
a
sum
of
marks
the
yearly
interest
on
which
was
to
be
divided
among
the
four
county
councils
for
charitable
and
generally
useful
purposes
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
drove
in
one
of
spoelmann
motors
on
a
round
of
visits
to
the
members
of
the
house
of
grimmburg
a
young
chauffeur
drove
the
sumptuous
car
the
one
in
which
imma
had
found
a
likeness
to
klaus
heinrich
but
his
nervous
tension
was
but
small
on
this
trip
for
he
had
to
restrain
the
motor
giant
strength
so
far
as
possible
and
go
slowly
so
closely
were
they
surrounded
by
admiring
crowds
for
as
the
more
remote
authors
of
our
happiness
grand
duke
albrecht
and
samuel
spoelmann
each
in
his
own
fashion
concealed
themselves
from
the
crowd
the
latter
heaped
all
its
love
and
gratitude
on
the
heads
of
the
exalted
couple
boys
could
be
seen
through
the
plate
glass
of
the
motor
throwing
their
caps
in
the
air
the
shouts
of
men
and
women
came
surging
in
clear
and
shrill
and
klaus
heinrich
his
hand
to
his
helmet
said
admonishingly
you
must
respond
too
imma
to
your
side
otherwise
they
think
you
cold
they
drove
to
princess
katharine
and
were
received
with
dignity
in
the
time
of
grand
duke
johann
albrecht
her
brother
said
the
aunt
to
her
nephew
it
would
never
have
been
allowed
but
the
times
moved
fast
and
she
prayed
heaven
that
his
betrothed
would
accustom
herself
to
the
court
they
proceeded
to
princess
zu
and
there
it
was
love
she
met
with
ditlinde
grimmburg
pride
found
comfort
in
the
assurance
that
leviathan
daughter
might
become
princess
of
the
grand
ducal
house
and
royal
highness
but
could
never
be
grand
ducal
princess
like
herself
for
the
rest
she
was
overjoyed
that
klaus
heinrich
had
rummaged
out
for
himself
anything
so
sweet
and
precious
as
the
wife
of
philipp
with
his
peat
she
had
the
best
reasons
for
knowing
how
to
value
the
advantages
of
the
match
and
cordially
welcomed
her
to
her
arms
they
drove
too
to
prince
lambert
villa
and
while
the
struggled
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
the
dazzling
but
very
uneducated
baroness
von
rohrdorf
the
old
congratulated
his
nephew
in
his
sepulchral
voice
on
the
unprejudiced
choice
he
had
made
and
on
so
boldly
snapping
his
fingers
at
court
and
highness
i
am
not
snapping
my
fingers
at
my
highness
uncle
not
only
have
i
had
an
eye
to
my
own
happiness
in
no
inconsiderable
measure
but
i
have
acted
throughout
with
the
mass
the
whole
in
view
said
klaus
heinrich
rather
rudely
whereupon
they
broke
off
and
drove
to
schloss
segenhaus
where
dorothea
the
poor
dowager
held
her
dreary
court
she
cried
as
she
kissed
the
young
bride
on
the
forehead
without
knowing
why
she
did
so
meanwhile
samuel
spoelmann
sat
at
delphinenort
surrounded
with
plans
and
sketches
of
furniture
and
silk
and
drawings
of
gold
plate
he
left
his
organ
untouched
and
forgot
the
stone
in
his
kidney
and
got
quite
red
cheeks
from
merely
having
so
much
to
do
for
however
small
the
opinion
he
had
formed
of
the
young
man
or
the
hope
he
held
out
of
his
ever
being
seen
at
court
yet
his
daughter
was
going
to
be
married
and
he
wanted
the
arrangements
to
be
worthy
of
his
means
the
plans
had
to
do
with
the
new
schloss
hermitage
for
klaus
bachelor
quarters
were
to
be
razed
to
the
ground
and
a
new
schloss
built
on
its
site
roomy
and
bright
and
decorated
by
klaus
wish
in
a
mixture
of
empire
and
modern
styles
combining
cool
severity
with
homely
comfort
spoelmann
appeared
one
morning
in
person
after
drinking
the
waters
in
the
in
his
faded
at
the
hermitage
in
order
to
find
out
whether
this
or
that
piece
of
furniture
could
be
used
for
the
new
schloss
let
see
young
prince
what
you
got
he
snarled
and
klaus
heinrich
showed
him
everything
in
his
sober
room
the
thin
sofas
the
tables
the
tables
in
the
corners
gimcrack
said
spoelmann
no
use
for
anything
three
only
in
the
little
yellow
room
of
heavy
mahogany
with
convolute
arms
and
the
yellow
covers
embroidered
with
blue
lyres
found
favour
in
his
eyes
we
can
put
those
in
an
he
said
and
klaus
heinrich
was
relieved
that
these
should
be
contributed
to
the
furnishing
by
the
grimmburg
side
for
of
course
it
would
have
been
rather
painful
to
him
if
spoelmann
had
had
to
find
every
single
thing
but
the
ragged
park
and
at
the
hermitage
had
to
be
cleared
and
restocked
the
in
particular
was
honoured
with
a
special
ornament
which
klaus
heinrich
had
asked
his
brother
to
give
him
as
a
for
it
was
arranged
that
the
from
the
old
schloss
should
be
transplanted
to
the
big
middle
bed
in
front
of
the
approach
and
then
no
longer
surrounded
by
mouldy
walls
but
in
the
air
and
sunshine
and
the
stiffest
clay
obtainable
it
should
be
seen
what
sort
of
roses
it
could
bear
in
future
and
give
the
lie
to
the
popular
report
if
it
were
obstinate
and
arrogant
enough
and
when
march
and
april
had
passed
may
came
bringing
the
great
event
of
klaus
heinrich
and
imma
marriage
it
was
a
glorious
day
with
golden
clouds
in
the
sky
and
its
dawn
was
greeted
by
a
choir
from
the
tower

stood
behind

showing
in

she
held

wisp
of
dark
hair
fell
across
her
forehead
under
the
veil
while
her
big
black
eyes
threw
glances
of
pleading
eloquence
over
the
throng
and

by

him
beyond
measure
robbed
him
of
all
and
convulsed
him
almost
beyond
bearance
he
raged
he
danced
he
leaped
he
circled
blindly
round
and
round
in
the
intoxication
of
his
nerves
and
the
shouts
redoubled
in
the
balconies
and
street
and
on
the
roofs
on
both
sides
as

people
recognized
him

were
for
outside

imposing

several
of

what

said
listen
imma
how
thankful
they
are
that
we
have
not
forgotten
their
need
and
affliction
what
crowds
there
are
standing
there
and
shouting
up
to
us
of
course
many
of
them
are
scoundrels
and
take
each
other
in
and
sadly
need
to
be
elevated
above
the
and
its
reality
but
they
are
really
grateful
when
one
shows
oneself
conscious
of
their
need
and
affliction
but
we
are
so
stupid
and
so
lonely
prince
on
the
peaks
of
humanity

always
to
say

nothing

imma
what
was
it
then

at
last
gave
you
confidence
