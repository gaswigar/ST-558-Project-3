chapter
our
adventurer
is
made
acquainted
with
a
new
scene
of
life
just
as
he
entered
these
mansions
of
misery
his
ears
were
invaded
with
a
hoarse
and
dreadful
voice
exclaiming
you
bess
beetle
score
a
couple
of
fresh
eggs
a
pennyworth
of
butter
and
half
a
pint
of
mountain
to
the
king
and
stop

till
the
bill
is
paid
he
is
now
debtor
for
fifteen
shillings
and
sixpence
and
d
n
me
if
i
trust
him
one
farthing
more
if
he
was
the
best
king
in
christendom
and
d
hear
send
with
five
pounds
of
potatoes
for
major
macleaver
supper
and
let
him
have
what
drink
he
wants
the
fat
widow
gentlewoman
from
pimlico
has
promised
to
quit
his
score
sir
mungo
barebones
may
have
some
hasty
pudding
and
small
beer
though
i
do
expect
to
see
his
coin
no
more
than
to
receive
the
eighteen
pence
i
laid
out
for
a
pair
of
breeches
to
his
backside
what
then
he
a
quiet
sort
of
a
body
and
a
great
scholar
and
it
was
a
scandal
to
the
place
to
see
him
going
about
in
that
naked
condition
as
for
the
mad
frenchman
with
the
beard
if
you
give
him
so
much
as
a
you
b
ch
i
send
you
back
to
the
hole
among
your
old
companions
an
impudent
dog
i
teach
him
to
draw
his
sword
upon
the
governor
of
an
english
county
jail
what
i
suppose
he
thought
he
had
to
do
with
a
french
rabbit
him
he
shall
eat
his
white
feather
before
i
give
him
credit
for
a
morsel
of
bread
although
our
adventurer
was
very
little
disposed
at
this
juncture
to
make
observations
foreign
to
his
own
affairs
he
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
these
extraordinary
injunctions
especially
those
concerning
the
person
who
was
entitled
king
whom
however
he
supposed
to
be
some
prisoner
elected
as
the
magistrate
by
the
joint
suffrage
of
his
fellows
having
taken
possession
of
his
chamber
which
he
rented
at
five
shillings
a
week
and
being
ill
at
ease
in
his
own
thoughts
he
forthwith
secured
his
door
undressed
and
went
to
bed
in
which
though
it
was
none
of
the
most
elegant
or
inviting
couches
he
enjoyed
profound
repose
after
the
accumulated
fatigues
and
mortifications
of
the
day
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
keeper
entered
his
apartment
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
gentlemen
under
his
care
having
heard
of
the
count
arrival
had
deputed
one
of
their
number
to
wait
upon
him
with
the
compliments
of
condolence
suitable
to
the
occasion
and
invite
him
to
become
a
member
of
their
society
our
hero
could
not
politely
dispense
with
this
instance
of
civility
and
their
ambassador
being
instantly
introduced
by
the
name
of
captain
minikin
saluted
him
with
great
solemnity
this
was
a
person
equally
remarkable
for
his
extraordinary
figure
and
address
his
age
seemed
to
border
upon
forty
his
stature
amounted
to
five
feet
his
visage
was
long
meagre
and
and
his
aspect
though
not
quite
rueful
exhibited
a
certain
formality
which
was
the
result
of
care
and
conscious
importance
he
was
very
little
encumbered
with
flesh
and
blood
yet
what
body
he
had
was
well
proportioned
his
limbs
were
elegantly
turned
and
by
his
carriage
he
was
well
entitled
to
that
compliment
which
we
pay
to
any
person
when
we
say
he
has
very
much
the
air
of
a
gentleman
there
was
also
an
evident
singularity
in
his
dress
which
though
intended
as
an
improvement
appeared
to
be
an
extravagant
exaggeration
of
the
mode
and
at
once
evinced
him
an
original
to
the
discerning
eyes
of
our
adventurer
who
received
him
with
his
usual
complaisance
and
made
a
very
eloquent
acknowledgment
of
the
honour
and
satisfaction
he
received
from
the
visit
of
the
representative
and
the
hospitality
of
his
constituents
the
captain
peculiarities
were
not
confined
to
his
external
appearance
for
his
voice
resembled
the
sound
of
a
bassoon
or
the
aggregate
hum
of
a
whole
and
his
discourse
was
almost
nothing
else
than
a
series
of
quotations
from
the
english
poets
interlarded
with
french
phrases
which
he
retained
for
their
significance
on
the
recommendation
of
his
friends
being
himself
unacquainted
with
that
or
any
other
outlandish
tongue
fathom
finding
this
gentleman
of
a
very
communicative
disposition
thought
he
could
not
have
a
fairer
opportunity
of
learning
the
history
of
his
and
turning
the
conversation
on
that
subject
was
not
disappointed
in
his
expectation
i
do
doubt
sir
said
he
with
the
utmost
solemnity
of
declamation
but
you
look
with
horror
upon
every
object
that
surrounds
you
in
this
uncomfortable
place
but
nevertheless
here
are
some
who
as
my
friend
shakespeare
has
it
have
seen
better
days
and
have
with
holy
bell
been
knolled
to
church
and
sat
at
good
men
feasts
and
wiped
their
eyes
of
drops
that
sacred
pity
hath
engendered
you
must
know
sir
that
exclusive
of
the
canaille
or
the
profanum
vulgus
as
they
are
styled
by
horace
there
are
several
small
communities
in
the
jail
consisting
of
people
who
are
attracted
by
the
manners
and
dispositions
of
each
other
for
this
place
sir
is
quite
a
microcosm
and
as
the
great
world
so
is
this
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
for
my
own
part
sir
i
have
always
made
it
a
maxim
to
associate
with
the
best
of
company
i
can
find
not
that
i
pretend
to
boast
of
my
family
or
extraction
because
you
know
as
the
poet
says
vix
ea
nostra
voco
my
father
is
true
was
a
man
that
piqued
himself
upon
his
pedigree
as
well
as
upon
his
politesse
and
personal
merit
for
he
had
been
a
very
old
officer
in
the
army
and
i
myself
may
say
i
was
born
with
a
spontoon
in
my
hand
sir
i
have
had
the
honour
to
serve
his
majesty
these
twenty
years
and
have
been
bandied
about
in
the
course
of
duty
through
all
the
british
plantations
and
you
see
the
recompense
of
all
my
service
but
this
is
a
disagreeable
subject
and
therefore
i
shall
waive
it
however
as
butler
observes
my
only
comfort
is
that
now
my
dubbolt
fortune
is
so
low
that
either
it
must
quickly
end
or
turn
about
again
and
mend
and
now
to
return
from
this
digression
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
head
or
chairman
of
our
club
is
really
a
sovereign
prince
no
less
i
assure
you
than
the
celebrated
theodore
king
of
corsica
who
lies
in
prison
for
a
debt
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
heu
quantum
mutatus
ab
illo
it
is
not
my
business
to
censure
the
conduct
of
my
superiors
but
i
always
speak
my
mind
in
a
cavalier
manner
and
as
according
to
the
spectator
talking
to
a
friend
is
no
more
than
thinking
aloud
entre
nous
his
corsican
majesty
has
been
scurvily
treated
by
a
certain
administration
be
that
as
it
will
he
is
a
personage
of
a
very
portly
appearance
and
is
quite
master
of
the
bienseance
besides
they
will
find
it
their
interest
to
have
recourse
again
to
his
alliance
and
in
that
case
some
of
us
may
expect
to
profit
by
his
restoration
but
few
words
are
best
he
that
maintains
the
second
rank
in
our
assembly
is
one
major
macleaver
an
irish
gentleman
who
has
served
abroad
a
soldier
of
fortune
sir
a
man
of
unquestionable
honour
and
courage
but
a
little
overbearing
in
consequence
of
his
knowledge
and
experience
he
is
a
person
of
good
address
to
be
sure
and
quite
free
of
the
mauvaise
honte
and
he
may
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
but
what
then
other
people
may
be
as
good
as
he
though
they
have
not
had
such
opportunities
if
he
speaks
five
or
six
languages
he
does
not
pretend
to
any
taste
in
the
liberal
arts
which
are
the
criterion
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
the
next
is
sir
mungo
barebones
the
representative
of
a
very
ancient
family
in
the
north
his
affairs
are
very
much
deranged
but
he
is
a
gentleman
of
great
probity
and
learning
and
at
present
engaged
in
a
very
grand
scheme
which
if
he
can
bring
it
to
bear
will
render
him
famous
to
all
posterity
no
less
than
the
conversion
of
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
the
project
i
own
looks
chimerical
to
one
who
has
not
conversed
with
the
author
but
in
my
opinion
he
has
clearly
demonstrated
from
an
anagrammatical
analysis
of
a
certain
hebrew
word
that
his
present
majesty
whom
god
preserve
is
the
person
pointed
at
in
scripture
as
the
temporal
messiah
of
the
jews
and
if
he
could
once
raise
by
subscription
such
a
trifling
sum
as
twelve
hundred
thousand
pounds
i
make
no
doubt
but
he
would
accomplish
his
aim
vast
and
romantic
as
it
seems
to
be
besides
these
we
have
another
messmate
who
is
a
french
chevalier
an
odd
sort
of
a
man
a
kind
of
lazarillo
de
tormes
a
caricatura
he
wears
a
long
beard
pretends
to
be
a
great
poet
and
makes
a
d
fracas
with
his
verses
the
king
has
been
obliged
to
exert
his
authority
over
him
more
than
once
by
ordering
him
into
close
confinement
for
which
he
was
so
rash
as
to
send
his
majesty
a
challenge
but
he
afterwards
made
his
submission
and
was
again
taken
into
favour
the
truth
is
i
believe
his
brain
is
a
little
disordered
and
he
being
a
stranger
we
overlook
his
extravagancies
sir
we
shall
think
ourselves
happy
in
your
accession
to
our
society
you
will
be
under
no
sort
of
restraint
for
though
we
dine
at
one
table
every
individual
calls
and
pays
for
his
own
mess
our
conversation
such
as
it
is
will
not
i
hope
be
disagreeable
and
though
we
have
not
opportunities
of
breathing
the
pure
arcadian
air
and
can
not
the
shade
of
melancholy
boughs
lose
and
neglect
the
creeping
hours
of
time
we
may
enjoy
ourselves
over
a
glass
of
punch
or
a
dish
of
tea
nor
are
we
destitute
of
friends
who
visit
us
in
these
shades
of
distress
the
major
has
a
numerous
acquaintance
of
both
sexes
among
others
a
first
cousin
of
good
fortune
who
with
her
daughters
often
cheer
our
solitude
she
is
a
very
sensible
ladylike
gentlewoman
and
the
young
ladies
have
a
certain
degagee
air
that
plainly
shows
they
have
seen
the
best
company
besides
i
will
venture
to
recommend
minikin
as
a
woman
of
tolerable
breeding
and
capacity
who
i
hope
will
not
be
found
altogether
deficient
in
the
accomplishments
of
the
sex
so
that
we
find
means
to
make
little
parties
in
which
the
time
glides
away
insensibly
then
i
have
a
small
collection
of
books
which
are
at
your
service
you
may
amuse
yourself
with
shakespeare
or
milton
or
don
quixote
or
any
of
our
modern
authors
that
are
worth
reading
such
as
the
adventures
of
loveill
lady
frail
george
edwards
joe
thompson
bampfylde
moore
carew
young
scarron
and
miss
betsy
thoughtless
and
if
you
have
a
taste
for
drawing
i
can
entertain
you
with
a
parcel
of
prints
by
the
best
masters
a
man
of
our
hero
politeness
could
not
help
expressing
himself
in
the
warmest
terms
of
gratitude
for
this
courteous
declaration
he
thanked
the
captain
in
particular
for
his
obliging
offers
and
begged
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
present
his
respects
to
the
society
of
which
he
longed
to
be
a
member
it
was
determined
therefore
that
minikin
should
return
in
an
hour
when
the
count
would
be
dressed
in
order
to
conduct
him
into
the
presence
of
his
majesty
and
he
had
already
taken
his
leave
for
the
present
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
came
back
and
taking
hold
of
a
waistcoat
that
lay
upon
a
chair
sir
said
he
give
me
leave
to
look
at
that
fringe
i
think
it
is
the
most
elegant
knitting
i
ever
saw
but
pray
sir
are
not
these
quite
out
of
fashion
i
thought
plain
silk
such
as
this
that
i
wear
had
been
the
mode
with
the
pockets
very
low
before
fathom
had
time
to
make
any
sort
of
reply
he
took
notice
of
his
hat
and
pumps
the
first
of
which
he
said
was
too
narrow
in
the
brims
and
the
last
an
inch
too
low
in
the
heels
indeed
they
formed
a
remarkable
contrast
with
his
own
for
exclusive
of
the
fashion
of
the
cock
which
resembled
the
form
of
a
roman
galley
the
brim
of
his
hat
if
properly
spread
would
have
projected
a
shade
sufficient
to
shelter
a
whole
file
of
musketeers
from
the
heat
of
a
summer
sun
and
the
heels
of
his
shoes
were
so
high
as
to
raise
his
feet
three
inches
at
least
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
having
made
these
observations
for
the
credit
of
his
taste
he
retired
and
returning
at
the
time
appointed
accompanied
ferdinand
to
the
apartment
of
the
king
at
the
doors
of
which
their
ears
were
invaded
with
a
strange
sound
being
that
of
a
human
voice
imitating
the
noise
of
a
drum
the
captain
hearing
this
alarm
made
a
full
stop
and
giving
the
count
to
understand
that
his
majesty
was
busy
begged
he
would
not
take
it
amiss
if
the
introduction
should
be
delayed
for
a
few
moments
fathom
curious
to
know
the
meaning
of
what
he
had
heard
applied
to
his
guide
for
information
and
learned
that
the
king
and
the
major
whom
he
had
nominated
to
the
post
of
his
were
employed
in
landing
troops
upon
the
genoese
territory
that
is
that
they
were
settling
beforehand
the
manner
of
their
disembarkation
he
then
by
the
direction
of
his
conductor
reconnoitred
them
through
the
keyhole
and
perceived
the
sovereign
and
his
minister
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
a
deal
board
table
covered
with
a
large
chart
or
map
upon
which
he
saw
a
great
number
of
mussel
and
oyster
shells
ranged
in
a
certain
order
and
at
a
little
distance
several
regular
squares
and
columns
made
of
cards
cut
in
small
pieces
the
prince
himself
whose
eyes
were
reinforced
by
spectacles
surveyed
this
armament
with
great
attention
while
the
general
put
the
whole
in
action
and
conducted
their
motions
by
beat
of
drum
the
according
to
explanation
represented
the
transports
the
were
considered
as
the
that
covered
the
troops
in
landing
and
the
pieces
of
card
exhibited
the
different
bodies
into
which
the
army
was
formed
upon
its
disembarkation
as
an
affair
of
such
consequence
could
not
be
transacted
without
opposition
they
had
provided
divers
ambuscades
consisting
of
the
enemy
whom
they
represented
by
grey
peas
and
accordingly
general
macleaver
perceiving
the
said
grey
peas
marching
along
shore
to
attack
his
forces
before
they
could
be
drawn
up
in
battalia
thus
addressed
himself
to
the
in
an
audible
voice
you
do
you
see
the
front
of
the
enemy
advancing
and
the
rest
of
the
detachment
following
out
of
sight
arrah
the
devil
burn
you
why
do
you
come
ashore
and
open
your
batteries
so
saying
he
pushed
the
shells
towards
the
breach
performed
the
cannonading
with
his
voice
the
grey
peas
were
soon
put
in
confusion
the
general
was
beat
the
cards
marched
forwards
in
order
of
battle
and
the
enemy
having
retreated
with
great
precipitation
they
took
possession
of
their
ground
without
farther
difficulty
chapter

he
contemplates
majesty
and
its
satellites
in
eclipse
this
expedition
being
happily
finished
general
macleaver
put
the
whole
army
navy
transports
and
scene
of
action
into
a
canvas
bag
the
prince
unsaddled
his
nose
and
captain
minikin
being
admitted
our
hero
was
introduced
in
form
very
gracious
was
the
reception
he
met
with
from
his
majesty
who
with
a
most
princely
demeanour
welcomed
him
to
court
and
even
seated
him
on
his
right
hand
in
token
of
particular
regard
true
it
is
this
was
not
so
superb
nor
the
appearance
of
the
king
so
magnificent
as
to
render
such
an
honour
intoxicating
to
any
person
of
our
hero
coolness
and
discretion
in
lieu
of
tapestry
the
apartment
was
hung
with
halfpenny
ballads
a
without
curtains
supplied
the
place
of
a
canopy
and
instead
of
a
crown
his
majesty
wore
a
woollen
yet
in
spite
of
these
disadvantages
there
was
an
air
of
dignity
in
his
deportment
and
a
nice
physiognomist
would
have
perceived
something
majestic
in
the
features
of
his
countenance
he
was
certainly
a
personage
of
very
prepossessing
mien
his
manners
were
engaging
his
conversation
agreeable
and
any
man
whose
heart
was
subject
to
the
meltings
of
humanity
would
have
deplored
his
distress
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
most
pathetic
instance
of
that
miserable
reverse
to
which
all
human
grandeur
is
exposed
his
fall
was
even
greater
than
that
of
belisarius
who
after
having
obtained
many
glorious
victories
over
the
enemies
of
his
country
is
said
to
have
been
reduced
to
such
extremity
of
indigence
that
in
his
old
age
when
he
was
deprived
of
his
eyesight
he
sat
upon
the
highway
like
a
common
mendicant
imploring
the
charity
of
passengers
in
the
piteous
exclamation
of
date
obolum
belisario
that
is
spare
a
farthing
to
your
poor
old
soldier
belisarius
i
say
this
general
disgrace
was
not
so
remarkable
as
that
of
theodore
because
he
was
the
servant
of
justinian
consequently
his
fortune
depended
upon
the
nod
of
that
emperor
whereas
the
other
actually
possessed
the
throne
of
sovereignty
by
the
best
of
all
titles
namely
the
unanimous
election
of
the
people
over
whom
he
reigned
and
attracted
the
eyes
of
all
europe
by
the
efforts
he
made
in
breaking
the
bands
of
oppression
and
vindicating
that
liberty
which
is
the
birthright
of
man
the
english
of
former
days
alike
renowned
for
generosity
and
valour
treated
those
hostile
princes
whose
fate
it
was
to
wear
their
chains
with
such
delicacy
of
benevolence
as
even
dispelled
the
horrors
of
captivity
but
their
posterity
of
this
refined
age
feel
no
compunction
at
seeing
an
unfortunate
monarch
their
former
friend
ally
and
partisan
languish
amidst
the
miseries
of
a
loathsome
jail
for
a
paltry
debt
contracted
in
their
own
service
but
moralising
apart
our
hero
had
not
long
conversed
with
this
extraordinary
debtor
who
in
his
present
condition
assumed
no
other
title
than
that
of
baron
than
he
perceived
in
him
a
spirit
of
quixotism
which
all
his
experience
together
with
the
vicissitudes
of
his
fortune
had
not
been
able
to
overcome
not
that
his
ideas
soared
to
such
a
pitch
of
extravagant
hope
as
that
which
took
possession
of
his
messmates
who
frequently
quarrelled
one
with
another
about
the
degrees
of
favour
to
which
they
should
be
entitled
after
the
king
restoration
but
he
firmly
believed
that
affairs
would
speedily
take
such
a
turn
in
italy
as
would
point
out
to
the
english
court
the
expediency
of
employing
him
again
and
his
persuasion
seemed
to
support
him
against
every
species
of
poverty
and
mortification
while
they
were
busy
in
trimming
the
balance
of
power
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
their
deliberations
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
scullion
who
came
to
receive
their
orders
touching
the
bill
of
fare
for
dinner
and
his
majesty
found
much
more
difficulty
in
settling
this
important
concern
than
in
compromising
all
the
differences
between
the
emperor
and
the
queen
of
spain
at
length
however
general
macleaver
undertook
the
office
of
purveyor
for
his
prince
captain
minikin
insisted
upon
treating
the
count
and
in
a
little
time
the
table
was
covered
with
a
cloth
which
for
the
sake
of
my
delicate
readers
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
at
this
period
they
were
joined
by
sir
mungo
barebones
who
having
found
means
to
purchase
a
couple
of
mutton
chops
had
cooked
a
mess
of
broth
which
he
now
brought
in
a
saucepan
to
the
general
rendezvous
this
was
the
most
remarkable
object
which
had
hitherto
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
fathom
being
naturally
of
a
meagre
habit
he
was
by
indigence
and
hard
study
wore
almost
to
the
bone
and
so
bended
towards
the
earth
that
in
walking
his
body
described
at
least
degrees
of
a
circle
the
want
of
stockings
and
shoes
he
supplied
with
a
jockey
straight
boot
and
an
half
jack
his
thighs
and
middle
were
cased
in
a
monstrous
pair
of
brown
trunk
breeches
which
the
keeper
bought
for
his
use
from
the
executor
of
a
dutch
seaman
who
had
lately
died
in
the
jail
his
shirt
retained
no
signs
of
its
original
colour
his
body
was
shrouded
in
an
old
greasy
tattered
plaid
nightgown
a
blue
and
white
handkerchief
surrounded
his
head
and
his
looks
betokened
that
immense
load
of
care
which
he
had
voluntarily
incurred
for
the
eternal
salvation
of
sinners
yet
this
figure
uncouth
as
it
was
made
his
compliments
to
our
adventurer
in
terms
of
the
most
elegant
address
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
disclosed
a
great
fund
of
valuable
knowledge
he
had
appeared
in
the
great
world
and
borne
divers
offices
of
dignity
and
trust
with
universal
applause
his
courage
was
undoubted
his
morals
were
unimpeached
and
his
person
held
in
great
veneration
and
esteem
when
his
evil
genius
engaged
him
in
the
study
of
hebrew
and
the
mysteries
of
the
jewish
religion
which
fairly
disordered
his
brain
and
rendered
him
incapable
of
managing
his
temporal
affairs
when
he
ought
to
have
been
employed
in
the
functions
of
his
post
he
was
always
wrapt
in
visionary
conferences
with
moses
on
the
mount
rather
than
regulate
the
economy
of
his
household
he
chose
to
exert
his
endeavours
in
settling
the
precise
meaning
of
the
word
elohim
and
having
discovered
that
now
the
period
was
come
when
the
jews
and
gentiles
would
be
converted
he
postponed
every
other
consideration
in
order
to
facilitate
that
great
and
glorious
event
by
this
time
ferdinand
had
seen
every
member
of
the
club
except
the
french
chevalier
who
seemed
to
be
quite
neglected
by
the
society
for
his
name
was
not
once
mentioned
during
this
communication
and
they
sat
down
to
dinner
without
asking
whether
he
was
dead
or
alive
the
king
regaled
himself
with
a
plate
of
the
major
who
complained
that
his
appetite
had
forsaken
him
amused
himself
with
some
forty
hard
eggs
malaxed
with
salt
butter
the
knight
indulged
upon
his
soup
and
bouilli
and
the
captain
entertained
our
adventurer
with
a
neck
of
veal
roasted
with
potatoes
but
before
fathom
could
make
use
of
his
knife
and
fork
he
was
summoned
to
the
door
where
he
found
the
chevalier
in
great
agitation
his
eyes
sparkling
like
coals
of
fire
our
hero
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
apparition
who
having
asked
pardon
for
the
freedom
he
had
used
observed
that
understanding
the
count
was
a
foreigner
he
could
not
dispense
with
appealing
to
him
concerning
an
outrage
he
had
suffered
from
the
keeper
who
without
any
regard
to
his
rank
or
misfortunes
had
been
base
enough
to
refuse
him
credit
for
a
few
necessaries
until
he
could
have
a
remittance
from
his
steward
in
france
he
therefore
conjured
count
fathom
as
a
stranger
and
nobleman
like
himself
to
be
the
messenger
of
defiance
which
he
resolved
to
send
to
that
brutal
jailor
that
for
the
future
he
might
learn
to
make
proper
distinctions
in
the
exercise
of
his
function
fathom
who
had
no
inclination
to
offend
this
choleric
frenchman
assured
him
that
he
might
depend
upon
his
friendship
and
in
the
meantime
prevailed
upon
him
to
accept
of
a
small
supply
in
consequence
of
which
he
procured
a
pound
of
sausages
and
joined
the
rest
of
the
company
without
delay
making
a
very
suitable
addition
to
such
an
assemblage
of
rarities
though
his
age
did
not
exceed
thirty
years
his
beard
which
was
of
a
brindled
hue
flowed
down
like
aaron
to
his
middle
upon
his
legs
he
wore
red
stockings
rolled
up
over
the
joint
of
the
knee
his
breeches
were
of
blue
drab
with
vellum
and
garters
of
gold
lace
his
waistcoat
of
scarlet
his
coat
of
rusty
black
cloth
his
hair
twisted
into
a
ramilie
hung
down
to
his
rump
of
the
colour
of
jet
and
his
hat
was
adorned
with
a
white
feather
this
original
had
formed
many
ingenious
schemes
to
increase
the
glory
and
grandeur
of
france
but
was
discouraged
by
cardinal
fleury
who
in
all
appearance
jealous
of
his
great
talents
not
only
rejected
his
projects
but
even
sent
him
to
prison
on
pretence
of
being
offended
at
his
impertinence
perceiving
that
like
the
prophet
he
had
no
honour
in
his
own
country
he
no
sooner
obtained
his
release
than
he
retired
to
england
where
he
was
prompted
by
his
philanthropy
to
propose
an
expedient
to
our
ministry
which
would
have
saved
a
vast
effusion
of
blood
and
treasure
this
was
an
agreement
between
the
queen
of
hungary
and
the
late
emperor
to
decide
their
pretensions
by
a
single
combat
in
which
case
he
offered
himself
as
the
bavarian
champion
but
in
this
endeavour
he
also
proved
unsuccessful
then
turning
his
attention
to
the
delights
of
poetry
he
became
so
enamoured
of
the
muse
that
he
neglected
every
other
consideration
and
she
as
usual
gradually
conducted
him
to
the
author
goal
a
place
of
rest
appointed
for
all
those
sinners
whom
the
profane
love
of
poesy
hath
led
astray
chapter
one
quarrel
is
compromised
and
another
decided
by
unusual
arms
among
other
topics
of
conversation
that
were
discussed
at
this
genial
meeting
sir
mungo
scheme
was
brought
upon
the
carpet
by
his
majesty
who
was
graciously
pleased
to
ask
how
his
subscription
filled
to
this
interrogation
the
knight
answered
that
he
met
with
great
opposition
from
a
spirit
of
levity
and
which
seemed
to
prevail
in
this
generation
but
that
no
difficulties
should
discourage
him
from
persevering
in
his
duty
and
he
trusted
in
god
that
in
a
very
little
time
he
should
be
able
to
confute
and
overthrow
the
false
philosophy
of
the
moderns
and
to
restore
the
writings
of
moses
to
that
and
veneration
which
is
due
to
an
inspired
author
he
spoke
of
the
immortal
newton
with
infinite
contempt
and
undertook
to
extract
from
the
pentateuch
a
system
of
chronology
which
would
ascertain
the
progress
of
time
since
the
fourth
day
of
the
creation
to
the
present
hour
with
such
exactness
that
not
one
vibration
of
a
pendulum
should
be
lost
nay
he
affirmed
that
the
perfection
of
all
arts
and
sciences
might
be
attained
by
studying
these
secret
memoirs
and
that
he
himself
did
not
despair
of
learning
from
them
the
art
of
transmuting
baser
metals
into
gold
the
chevalier
though
he
did
not
pretend
to
contradict
these
assertions
was
too
much
attached
to
his
own
religion
to
acquiesce
in
the
project
of
converting
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
to
the
protestant
heresy
which
he
said
god
almighty
would
never
suffer
to
triumph
over
the
interests
of
his
own
holy
catholic
church
this
objection
produced
abundance
of
altercation
between
two
very
unequal
disputants
and
the
frenchman
finding
himself
puzzled
by
the
learning
of
his
antagonist
had
recourse
to
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
by
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
and
declaring
that
he
was
ready
to
lose
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
in
opposition
to
such
a
damnable
scheme
sir
mungo
though
in
all
appearance
reduced
to
the
last
stage
of
animal
existence
no
sooner
heard
this
epithet
applied
to
his
plan
than
his
eyes
gleamed
like
lightning
he
sprung
from
his
seat
with
the
agility
of
a
grasshopper
and
darting
himself
out
at
the
door
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
reappeared
in
a
moment
with
a
long
rusty
weapon
which
might
have
been
shown
among
a
collection
of
rarities
as
the
sword
of
guy
earl
of
warwick
this
implement
he
brandished
over
the
chevalier
head
with
the
dexterity
of
an
old
exclaiming
in
the
french
language
thou
art
a
profane
wretch
marked
out
for
the
vengeance
of
heaven
whose
unworthy
minister
i
am
and
here
thou
shalt
fall
by
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
the
chevalier
unterrified
by
this
dreadful
salutation
desired
he
would
accompany
him
to
a
more
convenient
place
and
the
world
might
have
been
deprived
of
one
or
both
these
had
not
general
macleaver
at
the
desire
of
his
majesty
interposed
and
found
means
to
bring
matters
to
an
accommodation
in
the
afternoon
the
society
was
visited
by
the
major
cousin
and
her
daughters
who
no
sooner
appeared
than
they
were
recognised
by
our
adventurer
and
his
acquaintance
with
them
renewed
in
such
a
manner
as
alarmed
the
delicacy
of
captain
minikin
who
in
the
evening
repaired
to
the
count
apartment
and
with
a
formal
physiognomy
accosted
him
in
these
words
sir
i
beg
pardon
for
this
intrusion
but
i
come
to
consult
you
about
an
affair
in
which
my
honour
is
concerned
and
a
soldier
without
honour
you
know
is
no
better
than
a
body
without
a
soul
i
have
always
admired
that
speech
of
hotspur
in
the
first
part
of
henry
the
fourth
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
there
is
a
boldness
and
ease
in
the
expression
and
the
images
are
very
picturesque
but
without
any
further
preamble
pray
sir
give
me
leave
to
ask
how
long
you
have
been
acquainted
with
those
ladies
who
drank
tea
with
us
this
afternoon
you
forgive
the
question
sir
when
i
tell
you
that
major
macleaver
introduced
minikin
to
them
as
to
ladies
of
character
and
i
do
know
how
sir
i
have
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
my
wife
has
been
imposed
upon
perhaps
i
may
be
mistaken
and
god
grant
i
may
but
there
was
a
je
ne
sais
quoi
in
their
behaviour
which
begins
to
alarm
my
suspicion
sir
i
have
nothing
but
my
reputation
to
depend
upon
and
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
when
i
earnestly
beg
to
know
what
rank
they
maintain
in
life
fathom
without
minding
the
consequence
told
him
with
a
simper
that
he
knew
them
to
be
very
ladies
who
devoted
themselves
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
this
explanation
had
no
sooner
escaped
from
his
lips
than
the
captain
face
began
to
glow
with
indignation
his
eyes
seemed
bursting
from
their
spheres
he
swelled
to
twice
his
natural
dimensions
and
raising
himself
on
his
tiptoes
pronounced
in
a
strain
that
emulated
thunder
blood
sir
you
seem
to
make
very
light
of
the
matter
but
it
is
no
joke
to
me
i
assure
you
and
macleaver
shall
see
that
i
am
not
to
be
affronted
with
impunity
sir
i
shall
take
it
as
a
singular
favour
if
you
will
be
the
bearer
of
a
billet
to
him
which
i
shall
write
in
three
words
nay
sir
you
must
give
me
leave
to
insist
upon
it
as
you
are
the
only
gentleman
of
our
mess
whom
i
can
intrust
with
an
affair
of
this
nature
fathom
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
disobliging
such
a
punctilious
warrior
after
having
in
vain
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
undertook
to
carry
the
challenge
which
was
immediately
penned
in
these
words
sir
you
have
violated
my
honour
in
imposing
upon
minikin
your
pretended
cousins
as
ladies
of
virtue
and
reputation
i
therefore
demand
such
satisfaction
as
a
soldier
ought
to
receive
and
expect
you
will
adjust
with
my
friend
count
fathom
the
terms
upon
which
you
shall
be
met
by
the
much
injured
goliah
minikin
this
morceau
being
sealed
and
directed
was
forthwith
carried
by
our
adventurer
to
the
lodgings
of
the
major
who
had
by
this
time
retired
to
rest
but
hearing
the
count
voice
he
got
up
and
opened
the
door
in
cuerpo
to
the
astonishment
of
ferdinand
who
had
never
before
seen
such
an
herculean
figure
he
made
an
apology
for
receiving
the
count
in
his
birthday
suit
to
which
he
said
he
was
reduced
by
the
heat
of
his
constitution
though
he
might
have
assigned
a
more
adequate
cause
by
owning
that
his
shirt
was
in
the
hands
of
his
washerwoman
then
shrouding
himself
in
a
blanket
desired
to
know
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
such
an
extraordinary
visit
he
read
the
letter
with
great
composure
like
a
man
accustomed
to
such
intercourse
then
addressing
himself
to
the
bearer
i
will
be
after
diverting
the
gentleman
said
he
in
any
manner
he
shall
think
proper
but
by
jesus
this
is
no
place
for
such
amusements
because
as
you
well
know
my
dear
count
if
both
should
be
killed
by
the
chance
of
war
neither
of
us
will
be
able
to
escape
and
after
the
breath
is
out
of
his
body
he
will
make
but
a
sorry
excuse
to
his
family
and
friends
but
that
is
no
concern
of
mine
and
therefore
i
am
ready
to
please
him
in
his
own
way
fathom
approved
of
his
remarks
which
he
reinforced
with
sundry
considerations
to
the
same
purpose
and
begged
the
assistance
of
the
major
advice
in
finding
some
expedient
to
terminate
the
affair
without
bloodshed
that
no
troublesome
consequences
might
ensue
either
to
him
or
to
his
antagonist
who
in
spite
of
this
overstraining
formality
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
worth
and
with
all
my
heart
said
the
generous
hibernian
i
have
a
great
regard
for
the
little
man
and
my
own
character
is
not
to
seek
at
this
time
of
day
i
have
served
a
long
apprenticeship
to
fighting
as
this
same
carcase
can
testify
and
if
he
compels
me
to
run
him
through
the
body
by
my
shoul
i
shall
do
it
in
a
friendly
manner
so
saying
he
threw
aside
the
blanket
and
displayed
scars
and
seams
innumerable
upon
his
body
which
appeared
like
an
old
patched
leathern
doublet
i
remember
proceeded
this
champion
when
i
was
a
slave
at
algiers
murphy
macmorris
and
i
happened
to
have
some
difference
in
the
bagnio
upon
which
he
bade
me
turn
out
for
what
said
i
are
no
weapons
that
a
gentleman
can
use
and
you
would
not
be
such
a
negro
as
to
box
like
an
english
carman
after
he
had
puzzled
himself
for
some
time
he
proposed
that
we
should
retire
into
a
corner
and
funk
one
another
with
brimstone
till
one
of
us
should
give
out
accordingly
we
crammed
half
a
dozen
tobacco
pipes
with
sulphur
and
setting
foot
to
foot
began
to
smoke
and
kept
a
constant
fire
until
macmorris
dropped
down
then
i
threw
away
my
pipe
and
taking
poor
murphy
in
my
arms
are
you
dead
said
i
you
are
dead
speak
by
jesus
cried
he
a
dead
but
i
speechless
so
he
owned
i
had
obtained
the
victory
and
we
were
as
good
friends
as
ever
now
if
minikin
thinks
proper
to
put
the
affair
upon
the
same
issue
i
will
smoke
a
pipe
of
brimstone
with
him
morning
and
if
i
cry
out
first
i
will
be
after
asking
pardon
for
this
supposed
affront
fathom
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
proposal
to
which
however
he
objected
on
account
of
minikin
delicate
constitution
which
might
suffer
more
detriment
from
breathing
in
an
atmosphere
of
sulphur
than
from
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
or
the
thrust
of
a
small
sword
he
therefore
suggested
another
expedient
in
lieu
of
the
sulphur
namely
the
gum
called
assafatida
which
though
abundantly
nauseous
could
have
no
effect
upon
the
infirm
texture
of
the
lieutenant
lungs
this
hint
being
relished
by
the
major
our
adventurer
returned
to
his
principal
and
having
repeated
the
other
arguments
against
the
use
of
mortal
instruments
described
the
succedaneum
which
he
had
concerted
with
macleaver
the
captain
at
first
believed
the
scheme
was
calculated
for
subjecting
him
to
the
ridicule
of
his
and
began
to
storm
with
great
violence
but
by
the
assurances
and
address
of
fathom
he
was
at
length
reconciled
to
the
plan
and
preparations
were
made
on
each
side
for
this
duel
which
was
actually
smoked
next
day
about
noon
in
a
small
closet
detached
from
the
challenger
apartment
and
within
hearing
of
his
majesty
and
all
his
court
assembled
as
witnesses
and
umpires
of
the
contest
the
combatants
being
locked
up
together
began
to
ply
their
engines
with
great
fury
and
it
was
not
long
before
captain
minikin
perceived
he
had
a
manifest
advantage
over
his
antagonist
for
his
organs
were
familiarised
to
the
effluvia
of
this
drug
which
he
had
frequently
used
in
the
course
of
an
hypochondriac
disorder
whereas
macleaver
who
was
a
stranger
to
all
sorts
of
medicine
by
his
wry
faces
and
attempts
to
puke
expressed
the
utmost
abhorrence
of
the
smell
that
invaded
his
nostrils
nevertheless
resolved
to
hold
out
to
the
last
extremity
he
continued
in
action
until
the
closet
was
filled
with
such
an
intolerable
vapour
as
discomposed
the
whole
economy
of
his
entrails
and
compelled
him
to
disgorge
his
breakfast
in
the
face
of
his
opponent
whose
nerves
were
so
disconcerted
by
this
disagreeable
and
unforeseen
discharge
that
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
in
a
swoon
and
the
major
bellowed
aloud
for
assistance
the
door
being
opened
he
ran
directly
to
the
window
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
while
the
captain
recovering
from
his
fit
complained
of
macleaver
unfair
proceeding
and
demanded
justice
of
the
arbitrators
who
decided
in
his
favour
and
the
major
being
prevailed
upon
to
ask
pardon
for
having
introduced
minikin
to
women
of
rotten
reputation
the
parties
were
reconciled
to
each
other
and
peace
and
concord
in
the
mess
fathom
acquired
universal
applause
for
his
discreet
and
humane
conduct
upon
this
occasion
and
that
same
afternoon
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
lady
in
whose
cause
he
had
exerted
himself
he
was
presented
to
her
as
the
husband
particular
friend
and
when
she
understood
how
much
she
was
indebted
to
his
care
and
concern
for
the
captain
safety
she
treated
him
with
uncommon
marks
of
distinction
and
he
found
her
a
genteel
woman
not
without
a
good
deal
of
personal
charms
and
a
understanding
chapter
an
unexpected
rencontre
and
a
happy
revolution
in
the
affairs
of
our
adventurer
as
she
did
not
lodge
within
the
precincts
of
this
garrison
she
was
one
day
after
tea
conducted
to
the
gate
by
the
captain
and
the
count
and
just
as
they
approached
the
turnkey
lodge
our
hero
eyes
were
struck
with
the
apparition
of
his
old
companion
renaldo
son
of
his
benefactor
and
patron
the
count
de
melvil
what
were
the
emotions
of
his
soul
when
he
saw
that
young
gentleman
enter
the
prison
and
advance
towards
him
after
having
spoke
to
the
jailor
he
never
doubted
that
being
informed
of
his
confinement
he
was
come
to
upbraid
him
with
his
villany
and
ingratitude
and
he
in
vain
endeavoured
to
recollect
himself
from
that
terror
and
guilty
confusion
which
his
appearance
had
inspired
when
the
stranger
lifting
up
his
eyes
started
back
with
signs
of
extreme
amazement
and
after
a
considerable
pause
exclaimed
heaven
and
earth
sure
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
is
not
your
name
fathom
it
is
it
must
be
my
old
friend
and
companion
the
loss
of
whom
i
have
so
long
regretted
with
these
words
he
ran
towards
our
adventurer
and
while
he
clasped
him
in
his
arms
with
all
the
eagerness
of
affection
protested
that
this
was
one
of
the
happiest
days
he
had
ever
seen
ferdinand
who
from
this
salutation
concluded
himself
still
in
possession
of
renaldo
good
opinion
was
not
deficient
in
expressions
of
tenderness
and
joy
he
returned
his
embraces
with
equal
ardour
the
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
and
that
perturbation
which
proceeded
from
conscious
perfidy
and
fear
was
mistaken
by
the
unsuspecting
hungarian
for
the
sheer
effects
of
love
gratitude
and
surprise
these
first
transports
having
subsided
they
adjourned
to
the
lodgings
of
fathom
who
soon
recollected
his
spirits
and
invention
so
well
as
to
amuse
the
other
with
a
feigned
tale
of
his
having
been
taken
by
the
french
sent
prisoner
into
champagne
from
whence
he
had
written
many
letters
to
count
melvil
and
his
son
of
whom
he
could
hear
no
tidings
of
his
having
contracted
an
intimacy
with
a
young
nobleman
of
france
who
died
in
the
flower
of
his
age
after
having
in
token
of
his
friendship
bequeathed
to
him
a
considerable
legacy
by
this
he
had
been
enabled
to
visit
the
land
of
his
forefathers
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
which
he
had
supported
with
some
figure
until
he
was
betrayed
into
a
misfortune
that
exhausted
his
funds
and
drove
him
to
the
spot
where
he
was
now
found
and
he
solemnly
declared
that
far
from
forgetting
the
obligation
he
owed
to
count
melvil
or
renouncing
the
friendship
of
renaldo
he
had
actually
resolved
to
set
out
for
germany
on
his
return
to
the
house
of
his
patron
in
the
beginning
of
the
week
posterior
to
that
in
which
he
had
been
arrested
young
melvil
whose
own
heart
had
never
known
the
instigations
of
fraud
implicitly
believed
the
story
and
protestations
of
fathom
and
though
he
would
not
justify
that
part
of
his
conduct
by
which
the
term
of
his
good
fortune
was
abridged
he
could
not
help
excusing
an
indiscretion
into
which
he
had
been
hurried
by
the
precipitancy
of
youth
and
the
allurements
of
an
artful
woman
nay
with
the
utmost
warmth
of
friendship
he
undertook
to
wait
upon
trapwell
and
endeavour
to
soften
him
into
some
reasonable
terms
of
composition
fathom
seemed
to
be
quite
overwhelmed
with
a
deep
sense
of
all
this
goodness
and
affected
the
most
eager
impatience
to
know
the
particulars
of
renaldo
fate
since
their
unhappy
separation
more
especially
his
errand
to
this
uncomfortable
place
which
he
should
henceforth
revere
as
the
providential
scene
of
their
reunion
nor
did
he
forget
to
inquire
in
the
most
affectionate
and
dutiful
manner
about
the
situation
of
his
noble
parents
and
amiable
sister
at
mention
of
these
names
renaldo
fetching
a
deep
sigh
alas
my
friend
said
he
the
count
is
no
more
and
what
aggravates
my
affliction
for
the
loss
of
such
a
father
it
was
my
misfortune
to
be
under
his
displeasure
at
the
time
of
his
death
had
i
been
present
on
that
melancholy
occasion
so
well
i
knew
his
generosity
and
paternal
tenderness
that
sure
i
am
he
would
in
his
last
moments
have
forgiven
an
only
son
whose
life
had
been
a
continual
effort
to
render
himself
worthy
of
such
a
parent
and
whose
crime
was
no
other
than
an
honourable
passion
for
the
most
meritorious
of
her
sex
but
i
was
removed
at
a
fatal
distance
from
him
and
doubtless
my
conduct
must
have
been
invidiously
misrepresented
be
that
as
it
will
my
mother
has
again
given
her
hand
in
wedlock
to
count
trebasi
by
whom
i
have
the
mortification
to
be
informed
that
i
am
totally
excluded
from
my
succession
and
i
learn
from
other
quarters
that
my
sister
is
barbarously
treated
by
this
inhuman
grant
heaven
i
may
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
expostulating
with
the
tyrant
upon
that
subject
so
saying
his
cheeks
glowed
and
his
eyes
lightened
with
resentment
then
he
thus
proceeded
my
coming
hither
was
with
a
view
to
visit
a
poor
female
relation
from
whom
i
yesterday
received
a
letter
describing
her
most
deplorable
situation
and
soliciting
my
assistance
but
the
turnkey
affirms
that
there
is
no
such
person
in
the
jail
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
consult
the
keeper
when
i
was
agreeably
surprised
with
the
sight
of
my
dear
fathom
our
adventurer
having
wiped
from
his
eyes
the
tears
which
were
produced
by
the
news
of
his
worthy
patron
death
desired
to
know
the
name
of
that
afflicted
prisoner
in
whose
behalf
he
interested
himself
so
much
and
renaldo
produced
the
letter
subscribed
your
unfortunate
cousin
helen
melvil
this
pretended
relation
after
having
explained
the
degree
of
consanguinity
which
she
and
the
count
stood
in
to
each
other
and
occasionally
mentioned
some
anecdotes
of
the
family
in
scotland
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
had
married
a
merchant
of
london
who
by
repeated
losses
in
trade
had
been
reduced
to
indigence
and
afterwards
confined
to
prison
where
he
then
lay
a
breathless
corpse
having
left
her
in
the
utmost
extremity
of
wretchedness
and
want
with
two
young
children
in
the
smallpox
and
an
incurable
cancer
in
one
of
her
own
breasts
indeed
the
picture
she
drew
was
so
moving
and
her
expressions
so
sensibly
pathetic
that
no
person
whose
heart
was
not
altogether
callous
could
peruse
it
without
emotion
renaldo
had
sent
two
guineas
by
the
messenger
whom
she
had
represented
as
a
trusty
servant
whose
fidelity
had
been
proof
against
all
the
distress
of
her
mistress
and
he
was
now
arrived
in
order
to
reinforce
his
bounty
fathom
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
practices
immediately
comprehended
the
scheme
of
this
letter
and
confidently
assured
him
that
no
such
person
resided
in
the
prison
or
in
any
other
place
and
when
his
friend
applied
for
information
to
the
keeper
these
assurances
were
confirmed
and
that
stern
janitor
told
him
he
had
been
imposed
upon
by
a
stale
trick
which
was
often
practised
upon
strangers
by
a
set
of
sharpers
who
make
it
their
business
to
pick
up
hints
of
intelligence
relating
to
private
families
upon
which
they
build
such
superstructures
of
fraud
and
imposition
however
piqued
the
young
hungarian
might
be
to
find
himself
duped
in
this
manner
he
rejoiced
at
the
occasion
which
had
thrown
fathom
in
his
way
and
after
having
made
him
a
tender
of
his
purse
took
his
leave
on
purpose
to
wait
upon
trapwell
who
was
not
quite
so
untractable
as
an
enraged
cuckold
commonly
is
for
by
this
time
he
had
accomplished
the
best
part
of
his
aim
which
was
to
be
divorced
from
his
wife
and
was
fully
convinced
that
the
defendant
was
no
more
than
a
needy
adventurer
who
in
all
probability
would
be
released
by
an
act
of
parliament
for
the
benefit
of
insolvent
debtors
in
which
case
he
the
plaintiff
would
reap
no
solid
advantage
from
his
imprisonment
he
therefore
listened
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
mediator
and
after
much
canvassing
agreed
to
discharge
the
defendant
in
consideration
of
two
hundred
pounds
which
were
immediately
paid
by
count
melvil
who
by
this
deduction
was
reduced
to
somewhat
less
than
thirty
nevertheless
he
cheerfully
beggared
himself
in
behalf
of
his
friend
for
whose
release
he
forthwith
obtained
an
order
and
next
day
our
adventurer
having
bid
a
formal
adieu
to
his
fellows
in
distress
and
in
particular
to
his
majesty
for
whose
restoration
his
prayers
were
preferred
he
quitted
the
jail
and
accompanied
his
deliverer
with
all
the
outward
marks
of
unutterable
gratitude
and
esteem
surely
if
his
heart
had
been
made
of
penetrable
stuff
it
would
have
been
touched
by
the
circumstances
of
this
redemption
but
had
not
his
soul
been
invincible
to
all
such
attacks
these
memoirs
would
possibly
never
have
seen
the
light
when
they
arrived
at
renaldo
lodgings
that
young
gentleman
honoured
him
with
other
proofs
of
confidence
and
friendship
by
giving
him
a
circumstantial
detail
of
all
the
adventures
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
after
fathom
desertion
from
the
imperial
camp
he
told
him
that
immediately
after
the
war
was
finished
his
father
had
pressed
him
to
a
very
advantageous
match
with
which
he
would
have
complied
though
his
heart
was
not
at
all
concerned
had
not
he
been
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
seeing
the
world
before
he
could
take
any
step
towards
a
settlement
for
life
that
he
had
signified
his
sentiments
on
this
head
to
the
count
who
opposed
them
with
unusual
obstinacy
as
productive
of
a
delay
which
might
be
fatal
to
his
proposal
for
which
reason
he
had
retired
incognito
from
his
family
and
travelled
through
sundry
states
and
countries
in
a
disguise
by
which
he
eluded
the
inquiries
of
his
parents
that
in
the
course
of
these
peregrinations
he
was
captivated
by
the
irresistible
charms
of
a
young
lady
on
whose
heart
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
make
a
tender
impression
that
their
mutual
love
had
subjected
both
to
many
dangers
and
difficulties
during
which
they
suffered
a
cruel
separation
after
the
torments
of
which
he
had
happily
found
her
in
england
where
she
now
lived
entirely
cut
off
from
her
native
country
and
connexions
and
destitute
of
every
other
resource
but
his
honour
love
and
protection
and
finally
that
he
was
determined
to
combat
his
own
desires
how
violent
soever
they
might
be
until
he
should
have
made
some
suitable
provision
for
the
consequences
of
a
stricter
union
with
the
mistress
of
his
soul
that
he
might
not
by
a
precipitate
marriage
ruin
the
person
whom
he
adored
this
end
he
proposed
to
attain
by
an
application
to
the
court
of
vienna
which
he
did
not
doubt
would
have
some
regard
to
his
own
service
and
that
of
his
father
and
thither
he
resolved
to
repair
with
the
first
opportunity
now
that
he
had
found
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
intrust
the
inestimable
jewel
of
his
heart
he
likewise
gave
our
hero
to
understand
that
he
had
been
eight
months
in
england
during
which
he
had
lived
in
a
frugal
manner
that
he
might
not
unnecessarily
exhaust
the
money
he
had
been
able
to
raise
upon
his
own
credit
that
hitherto
he
had
been
obliged
to
defer
his
departure
for
germany
on
account
of
his
attendance
upon
the
mother
of
his
mistress
who
was
lately
dead
of
sorrow
and
chagrin
and
that
since
he
resided
in
london
he
had
often
heard
of
the
celebrated
count
fathom
though
he
never
imagined
that
his
friend
ferdinand
could
be
distinguished
by
that
appellation
chapter
fathom
justifies
the
proverb
what
bred
in
the
bone
will
never
come
out
of
the
flesh
some
circumstances
of
this
conversation
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
who
nevertheless
concealed
his
emotions
from
the
knowledge
of
his
friend
and
was
next
day
introduced
to
that
hidden
treasure
of
which
renaldo
had
spoken
with
such
rapture
and
adoration
it
was
not
without
reason
he
had
expatiated
upon
the
personal
attractions
of
this
young
lady
whom
for
the
present
we
shall
call
monimia
a
name
that
implies
her
orphan
situation
when
she
entered
the
room
even
fathom
whose
eyes
had
been
sated
with
beauty
was
struck
dumb
with
admiration
and
could
scarce
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
his
introduction
she
seemed
to
be
about
the
age
of
eighteen
her
stature
was
tall
her
motion
graceful
a
knot
of
artificial
flowers
restrained
the
luxuriancy
of
her
fine
black
hair
that
flowed
in
shining
ringlets
adown
her
snowy
neck
the
contour
of
her
face
was
oval
her
forehead
remarkably
high
her
complexion
clean
and
delicate
though
not
florid
and
her
eyes
were
so
piercing
as
to
strike
the
soul
of
every
beholder
yet
upon
this
occasion
one
half
of
their
vivacity
was
eclipsed
by
a
languishing
air
of
melancholy
concern
which
while
it
in
a
manner
sheathed
the
edge
of
her
beauty
added
a
most
engaging
sweetness
to
her
looks
in
short
every
feature
was
elegantly
perfect
and
the
harmony
of
the
whole
ravishing
and
delightful
it
was
easy
to
perceive
the
mutual
sentiments
of
the
two
lovers
at
meeting
by
the
pleasure
that
sensibly
diffused
itself
in
the
countenances
of
both
fathom
was
received
by
her
as
the
intimate
friend
of
her
admirer
whom
she
had
often
heard
of
in
terms
of
the
most
sincere
affection
and
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
the
italian
language
because
she
was
a
foreigner
who
had
not
as
yet
made
great
proficiency
in
the
knowledge
of
the
english
tongue
her
understanding
was
such
as
instead
of
diminishing
reinforced
the
prepossession
which
was
inspired
by
her
appearance
and
if
the
of
her
charms
could
not
melt
the
heart
it
at
least
excited
the
appetite
of
fathom
to
such
a
degree
that
he
gazed
upon
her
with
such
violence
of
desire
as
had
never
transported
him
before
and
he
instantly
began
to
harbour
thoughts
not
only
destructive
to
the
peace
of
his
generous
patron
but
also
to
the
prudential
maxims
he
had
adopted
on
his
first
entrance
into
life
we
have
already
recorded
divers
instances
of
his
conduct
to
prove
that
there
was
an
intemperance
in
his
blood
which
often
interfered
with
his
caution
and
although
he
had
found
means
to
render
this
heat
sometimes
subservient
to
his
interest
yet
in
all
probability
heaven
mingled
the
ingredient
in
his
constitution
on
purpose
to
counteract
his
consummate
craft
defeat
the
villany
of
his
intention
and
at
least
expose
him
to
the
justice
of
the
law
and
the
contempt
of
his
stimulated
as
he
was
by
the
beauty
of
the
incomparable
monimia
he
foresaw
that
the
conquest
of
her
heart
would
cost
him
a
thousand
times
more
labour
and
address
than
all
the
victories
he
had
ever
achieved
for
besides
her
superior
understanding
her
sentiments
of
honour
virtue
gratitude
religion
and
pride
of
birth
her
heart
was
already
engaged
by
the
tenderest
ties
of
love
and
obligation
to
a
man
whose
person
and
acquired
accomplishments
at
least
equalled
his
own
and
whose
connexion
with
him
was
of
such
a
nature
as
raised
an
almost
insurmountable
bar
to
his
design
because
with
what
face
could
he
commence
rival
to
the
person
whose
family
had
raised
him
from
want
and
servility
and
whose
own
generosity
had
rescued
him
from
the
miseries
of
a
dreary
gaol
notwithstanding
these
reflections
he
would
not
lay
aside
an
idea
which
so
agreeably
flattered
his
imagination
he
like
every
other
projector
in
the
same
circumstances
was
so
partial
to
his
own
qualifications
as
to
think
the
lady
would
soon
perceive
a
difference
between
him
and
renaldo
that
could
not
fail
to
turn
to
his
advantage
in
her
opinion
he
depended
a
good
deal
on
the
levity
and
inconstancy
of
the
sex
and
did
not
doubt
that
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
he
should
profit
by
that
languor
which
often
creeps
upon
and
flattens
the
intercourse
of
lovers
cloyed
with
the
sight
and
conversation
of
each
other
this
way
of
arguing
was
very
natural
to
a
man
who
had
never
known
other
motives
than
those
of
sensuality
and
convenience
and
perhaps
upon
these
maxims
he
might
have
succeeded
with
of
the
fair
sex
but
for
once
he
erred
in
his
calculation
monimia
soul
was
perfect
her
virtue
impregnable
his
first
approaches
were
as
usual
performed
by
the
method
of
insinuation
which
succeeded
so
well
that
in
a
few
days
he
actually
acquired
a
very
distinguished
share
of
her
favour
and
esteem
to
this
he
had
been
recommended
in
the
warmest
strain
of
exaggerating
friendship
by
her
dear
renaldo
so
that
placing
the
most
unreserved
confidence
in
his
honour
and
integrity
and
being
almost
quite
destitute
of
acquaintance
she
made
no
scruple
of
owning
herself
pleased
with
his
company
and
conversation
and
therefore
he
was
never
abridged
in
point
of
opportunity
she
had
too
much
discernment
to
overlook
his
uncommon
talents
and
agreeable
address
and
too
much
susceptibility
to
observe
them
with
indifference
she
not
only
regarded
him
as
the
confidant
of
her
lover
but
admired
him
as
a
person
whose
attachment
did
honour
to
count
melvil
choice
she
found
his
discourse
remarkably
entertaining
his
politeness
dignified
with
an
air
of
uncommon
sincerity
and
she
was
ravished
with
his
skill
in
music
an
art
of
which
she
was
deeply
enamoured
while
he
thus
ingratiated
himself
with
the
fair
monimia
renaldo
rejoiced
at
their
intimacy
being
extremely
happy
in
the
thought
of
having
found
a
friend
who
could
amuse
and
protect
the
dear
creature
in
his
absence
that
she
might
be
the
better
prepared
for
the
temporary
separation
which
he
meditated
he
began
to
be
less
frequent
in
his
visits
or
rather
to
interrupt
by
gradual
intermissions
the
constant
attendance
he
had
bestowed
upon
her
since
her
mother
death
this
alteration
she
was
enabled
to
bear
by
the
assiduities
of
fathom
when
she
understood
that
her
lover
was
indispensably
employed
in
negotiating
a
sum
of
money
for
the
purposes
of
his
intended
voyage
this
was
really
the
case
for
as
the
reader
hath
been
already
informed
the
provision
he
had
made
for
that
emergency
was
expended
in
behalf
of
our
adventurer
and
the
persons
of
whom
he
had
borrowed
it
far
from
approving
of
the
use
to
which
it
was
put
and
accommodating
him
with
a
fresh
supply
reproached
him
with
his
benevolence
as
an
act
of
dishonesty
to
them
and
instead
of
favouring
this
second
application
threatened
to
distress
him
for
what
he
had
already
received
while
he
endeavoured
to
surmount
these
difficulties
his
small
reversion
was
quite
exhausted
and
he
saw
himself
on
the
brink
of
wanting
the
common
necessaries
of
life
there
was
no
difficulty
which
he
could
not
have
encountered
with
fortitude
had
he
alone
been
concerned
but
his
affection
and
regard
for
monimia
were
of
such
a
delicate
nature
that
far
from
being
able
to
bear
the
prospect
of
her
wanting
the
least
convenience
he
could
not
endure
that
she
should
suspect
her
situation
cost
him
a
moment
perplexity
because
he
foresaw
it
would
wring
her
gentle
heart
with
unspeakable
anguish
and
vexation
this
therefore
he
endeavoured
to
anticipate
by
expressions
of
confidence
in
the
emperor
equity
and
frequent
declarations
touching
the
goodness
and
security
of
that
credit
from
which
he
derived
his
present
subsistence
chapter
anecdotes
of
poverty
and
experiments
for
the
benefit
of
those
whom
it
may
concern
his
affairs
being
thus
circumstanced
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
passed
his
time
in
tranquillity
every
day
ushered
in
new
demands
and
fresh
anxiety
for
though
his
economy
was
frugal
it
could
not
be
supported
without
money
and
now
not
only
his
funds
were
drained
but
also
his
private
friends
tired
of
relieving
his
domestic
necessities
nay
they
began
to
relinquish
his
company
which
formerly
they
had
coveted
and
those
who
still
favoured
him
with
their
company
embittered
that
favour
with
disagreeable
advice
mingled
with
impertinent
reproof
they
loudly
exclaimed
against
the
last
instance
of
his
friendship
for
fathom
as
a
piece
of
extravagance
which
neither
his
fortune
could
afford
nor
his
conscience
excuse
and
alleged
that
such
specimens
of
generosity
are
vicious
in
any
man
let
his
finances
be
never
so
opulent
if
he
has
any
relations
of
his
own
who
need
his
assistance
but
altogether
scandalous
not
to
say
unjust
in
a
person
who
depends
for
his
own
support
on
the
favour
of
his
friends
these
expostulations
did
not
even
respect
the
beauteous
the
accomplished
the
the
orphan
monimia
although
they
owned
her
perfections
and
did
not
deny
that
it
would
be
highly
meritorious
in
any
man
of
fortune
to
make
her
happy
they
disapproved
of
renaldo
attachment
to
the
fair
beggar
made
light
of
that
intimate
union
of
hearts
which
subsisted
between
the
two
lovers
and
which
no
human
consideration
could
dissolve
and
some
among
them
in
the
consummation
of
their
prudence
ventured
to
hint
a
proposal
of
providing
for
her
in
the
service
of
some
lady
of
fashion
any
reader
of
sensibility
will
easily
conceive
how
these
admonitions
were
relished
by
a
young
gentleman
whose
pride
was
indomitable
whose
notions
of
honour
were
scrupulously
rigid
and
romantic
whose
temper
was
warm
and
whose
love
was
intense
every
such
suggestion
was
as
a
dagger
to
his
soul
and
what
rendered
the
torture
more
exquisite
he
lay
under
obligations
to
those
very
persons
whose
selfish
and
sordid
sentiments
he
disdained
so
that
he
was
restricted
by
gratitude
from
giving
vent
to
his
indignation
and
his
forlorn
circumstances
would
not
permit
him
to
renounce
their
acquaintance
while
he
struggled
with
these
mortifications
his
wants
grew
more
and
more
importunate
and
his
creditors
became
clamorous
fathom
to
whom
all
his
grievances
were
disclosed
lamented
his
hard
hap
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
sympathy
which
he
could
expect
to
find
in
such
a
zealous
adherent
he
upbraided
himself
incessantly
as
the
cause
of
his
patron
distress
took
god
to
witness
that
he
would
rather
have
perished
in
gaol
than
have
enjoyed
his
liberty
had
he
known
it
would
have
cost
his
dearest
friend
and
benefactor
part
of
the
anguish
he
now
saw
him
suffer
and
in
conclusion
the
fervency
of
his
affection
glowed
to
such
a
degree
that
he
offered
to
beg
steal
or
plunder
on
the
highway
for
renaldo
assistance
certain
it
is
he
might
have
recollected
a
less
disagreeable
expedient
than
any
of
these
to
alleviate
the
pangs
of
this
unhappy
lover
for
at
that
very
period
he
was
possessed
of
money
and
moveables
to
the
amount
of
a
much
greater
sum
than
that
which
was
necessary
to
remove
the
severest
pangs
of
the
count
misfortune
but
whether
he
did
not
reflect
upon
this
resource
or
was
willing
to
let
melvil
be
better
acquainted
with
adversity
which
is
the
great
school
of
life
i
shall
leave
the
reader
to
determine
yet
so
far
was
he
from
supplying
the
wants
of
the
young
hungarian
that
he
did
not
scruple
to
receive
a
share
of
the
miserable
pittance
which
that
gentleman
made
shift
to
extort
from
the
complaisance
of
a
few
companions
whose
countenance
he
still
enjoyed
renaldo
life
was
now
become
a
sacrifice
to
the
most
poignant
distress
almost
his
whole
time
was
engrossed
by
a
double
scheme
comprehending
his
efforts
to
render
his
departure
practicable
and
his
expedients
for
raising
the
means
of
daily
bread
with
regard
to
the
first
he
exerted
himself
among
a
set
of
merchants
some
of
whom
knew
his
family
and
expectations
and
for
the
last
he
was
fain
to
depend
upon
the
assistance
of
a
few
intimates
who
were
not
in
a
condition
to
furnish
him
with
sums
of
consequence
these
however
gradually
dropped
off
on
pretence
of
friendly
resentment
for
his
indiscreet
conduct
so
that
he
found
himself
naked
and
deserted
by
all
his
former
companions
except
one
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
lived
in
the
most
unreserved
correspondence
as
with
a
person
of
the
warmest
friendship
and
the
most
unbounded
benevolence
nay
he
had
actually
experienced
repeated
proofs
of
his
generosity
and
such
were
the
count
sentiments
of
the
gratitude
love
and
esteem
which
were
due
to
the
author
of
these
obligations
that
he
would
have
willingly
laid
down
his
own
life
for
his
interest
or
advantage
he
had
already
been
at
different
times
accommodated
by
this
benefactor
with
occasional
supplies
amounting
in
the
whole
to
about
forty
or
fifty
pounds
and
so
fearful
was
he
of
taking
any
step
by
which
he
might
forfeit
the
goodwill
of
this
gentleman
that
he
struggled
with
unparelleled
difficulty
and
vexation
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
put
his
liberality
to
another
proof
what
maxims
of
delicacy
will
not
the
dire
calls
of
necessity
infringe
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
applying
once
more
to
that
beneficence
which
had
never
failed
him
or
of
seeing
monimia
starve
he
chose
the
first
as
of
two
evils
the
least
and
intrusted
fathom
with
a
letter
explaining
the
bitterness
of
his
case
it
was
not
without
trepidation
that
he
received
in
the
evening
from
his
messenger
an
answer
to
this
billet
but
what
were
his
pangs
when
he
learned
the
contents
the
gentleman
after
having
professed
himself
melvil
sincere
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
resolved
for
the
future
to
detach
himself
from
every
correspondence
which
would
be
inconvenient
for
him
to
maintain
that
he
considered
his
intimacy
with
the
count
in
that
light
yet
nevertheless
if
his
distress
was
really
as
great
as
he
had
described
it
he
would
still
contribute
something
towards
his
relief
and
accordingly
had
sent
by
the
bearer
five
guineas
for
that
purpose
but
desired
him
to
take
notice
that
in
so
doing
he
laid
himself
under
some
difficulty
renaldo
grief
and
mortification
at
this
disappointment
were
unspeakable
he
now
saw
demolished
the
last
screen
betwixt
him
and
the
extremity
of
indigence
and
woe
he
beheld
the
mistress
of
his
soul
abandoned
to
the
bleakest
scenes
of
poverty
and
want
and
he
deeply
resented
the
lofty
strain
of
the
letter
by
which
he
conceived
himself
treated
as
a
worthless
spendthrift
and
importunate
beggar
though
his
purse
was
exhausted
to
the
last
shilling
though
he
was
surrounded
with
necessities
and
demands
and
knew
not
how
to
provide
another
meal
for
his
fair
dependent
he
in
opposition
to
all
the
suggestions
and
eloquence
of
fathom
despatched
him
with
the
money
and
another
billet
intimating
in
the
most
respectful
terms
that
he
approved
of
his
friend
maxim
which
for
the
future
he
should
always
take
care
to
remember
and
that
he
had
sent
back
the
last
instance
of
his
bounty
as
a
proof
how
little
he
was
disposed
to
incommode
his
benefactor
this
letter
though
sincerely
meant
and
written
in
a
very
serious
mood
the
gentleman
considered
as
an
ungrateful
piece
of
irony
and
in
that
opinion
complained
to
several
persons
of
the
count
acquaintance
who
unanimously
exclaimed
against
him
as
a
sordid
unthankful
and
profligate
knave
that
abused
and
reviled
those
very
people
who
had
generously
befriended
him
whenever
they
found
it
inconvenient
to
nourish
his
extravagance
with
further
supplies
notwithstanding
these
accumulated
oppressions
he
still
persevered
with
fortitude
in
his
endeavours
to
disentangle
himself
from
this
maze
of
misery
to
these
he
was
encouraged
by
a
letter
which
about
this
time
he
received
from
his
sister
importing
that
she
had
good
reason
to
believe
the
real
will
of
her
father
had
been
suppressed
for
certain
sinister
views
and
desiring
him
to
hasten
his
departure
for
hungary
where
he
would
still
find
some
friends
who
were
both
able
and
willing
to
support
his
cause
he
had
some
trinkets
left
the
pawnbroker
shop
was
still
open
and
hitherto
he
made
shift
to
conceal
from
monimia
the
extent
of
his
affliction
the
whom
he
employed
after
having
amused
him
with
a
variety
of
schemes
which
served
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
protracting
his
own
job
at
length
undertook
to
make
him
acquainted
with
a
set
of
monied
men
who
had
been
very
venturous
in
lending
sums
upon
personal
security
he
was
therefore
introduced
to
their
club
in
the
most
favourable
manner
after
the
broker
had
endeavoured
to
prepossess
them
separately
with
magnificent
ideas
of
his
family
and
by
means
of
this
anticipation
he
was
received
with
a
manifest
relaxation
of
that
severity
which
people
of
this
class
mingle
in
their
aspects
to
the
world
in
general
and
they
even
vied
with
each
other
in
their
demonstrations
of
hospitality
and
respect
for
every
one
in
particular
looked
upon
him
as
a
young
heir
who
would
bleed
freely
and
mortgage
at
cent
per
cent
renaldo
buoyed
up
with
these
exterior
civilities
began
to
flatter
himself
with
hopes
of
success
which
however
were
soon
checked
by
the
nature
of
the
conversation
during
which
the
chairman
upbraided
one
of
the
members
in
open
club
for
having
once
lent
forty
pounds
upon
slight
security
the
person
accused
alleged
in
his
own
defence
that
the
borrower
was
his
own
kinsman
whose
funds
he
knew
to
be
sufficient
that
he
had
granted
his
bond
and
been
at
the
expense
of
insuring
his
life
for
the
money
and
in
conclusion
had
discharged
it
to
the
day
with
great
punctuality
these
allegations
were
not
deemed
exculpatory
by
the
rest
of
the
assembly
who
with
one
voice
pronounced
him
guilty
of
unwarrantable
rashness
and
indiscretion
which
in
time
coming
must
undoubtedly
operate
to
the
prejudice
of
his
character
and
credit
this
was
a
bitter
declaration
to
the
young
count
who
nevertheless
endeavoured
to
improve
the
footing
he
had
gained
among
them
by
courting
their
company
conforming
to
their
manners
and
attentively
listening
to
their
discourse
when
he
had
cultivated
them
with
great
assiduity
for
the
space
of
some
weeks
dined
at
their
houses
upon
pressing
invitations
and
received
repeated
offers
of
service
and
friendship
believing
that
things
were
now
ripe
for
the
purpose
he
one
day
at
a
tavern
to
which
he
had
invited
him
to
dinner
ventured
to
disclose
his
situation
to
him
whose
countenance
was
the
least
unpromising
and
as
he
introduced
the
business
with
a
proposal
of
borrowing
money
he
perceived
his
eyes
sparkle
with
a
visible
alacrity
from
which
he
drew
a
happy
presage
but
alas
this
was
no
more
than
a
transient
gleam
of
sunshine
which
was
suddenly
obumbrated
by
the
sequel
of
his
explanation
insomuch
that
when
the
merchant
understood
the
nature
of
the
security
his
visage
was
involved
in
a
most
disagreeable
gloom
and
his
eyes
distorted
into
a
most
hideous
obliquity
of
vision
indeed
he
squinted
so
horribly
that
renaldo
was
amazed
and
almost
affrighted
at
his
looks
until
he
perceived
that
this
distortion
proceeded
from
concern
for
a
silver
tobacco
box
which
he
had
laid
down
by
him
on
the
table
after
having
filled
his
pipe
as
the
youth
proceeded
to
unfold
his
necessities
the
other
became
gradually
alarmed
for
this
utensil
to
which
he
darted
his
eyes
askance
in
this
preternatural
direction
until
he
had
slyly
secured
it
in
his
pocket
having
made
this
successful
conveyance
he
shifted
his
eyes
alternately
from
the
young
gentleman
to
the
broker
for
a
considerable
pause
during
which
he
in
silence
reproached
the
last
for
introducing
such
a
beggarly
varlet
to
his
acquaintance
then
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
sir
said
he
addressing
himself
to
the
count
if
i
had
all
the
inclination
in
the
world
to
comply
with
your
proposal
it
is
really
not
in
my
power
my
correspondents
abroad
have
remitted
such
a
number
of
bad
bills
of
late
that
all
my
running
cash
hath
been
exhausted
in
supporting
their
credit
ferret
sure
i
am
you
was
not
ignorant
of
my
situation
and
i
not
a
little
surprised
that
you
should
bring
the
gentleman
to
me
on
business
of
this
kind
but
as
the
wise
man
observes
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
and
he
never
be
wise
so
saying
with
a
most
emphatic
glance
directed
to
the
broker
he
rung
the
bell
and
called
for
the
reckoning
when
finding
that
he
was
to
be
the
guest
of
renaldo
he
thanked
him
drily
for
his
good
cheer
and
in
an
abrupt
manner
took
himself
away
though
baffled
in
this
quarter
the
young
gentleman
would
not
despair
but
forthwith
employed
ferret
in
an
application
to
another
of
the
society
who
after
having
heard
the
terms
of
his
commission
desired
him
to
tell
his
principal
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
the
concurrence
of
his
partner
who
happened
to
be
at
that
time
in
one
of
our
american
plantations
a
third
being
solicited
excused
himself
on
account
of
an
oath
which
he
had
lately
taken
on
the
back
of
a
considerable
loss
a
fourth
being
tried
made
answer
that
it
was
not
in
his
way
and
a
fifth
candidly
owned
that
he
never
lent
money
without
proper
security
thus
the
forlorn
renaldo
tried
every
experiment
without
success
and
now
saw
the
last
ray
of
hope
extinguished
destitute
of
present
support
and
encompassed
with
unrelenting
duns
he
was
obliged
to
keep
within
doors
and
seek
some
comfort
in
the
conversation
of
his
charming
mistress
and
his
faithful
friend
yet
even
there
he
experienced
the
extremest
rigour
of
adverse
fate
every
rap
at
the
door
alarmed
him
with
the
expectation
of
some
noisy
tradesman
demanding
payment
when
he
endeavoured
to
amuse
himself
with
drawing
some
unlucky
feature
of
the
occasional
portrait
recalled
the
image
of
an
obdurate
creditor
and
made
him
tremble
at
the
work
of
his
own
hands
when
he
fled
for
shelter
to
the
flattering
creation
of
fancy
some
abhorred
idea
always
started
up
amidst
the
gay
vision
and
dissolved
the
pleasing
even
the
seraphic
voice
of
monimia
had
no
longer
power
to
compose
the
anxious
tumults
of
his
mind
every
song
she
warbled
every
tune
she
played
recalled
to
his
remembrance
some
scene
of
love
and
happiness
elapsed
and
overwhelmed
his
soul
with
the
woful
comparison
of
past
and
present
fate
he
saw
all
that
was
amiable
and
perfect
in
woman
all
that
he
held
most
dear
and
sacred
upon
earth
tottering
on
the
brink
of
misery
without
knowing
the
danger
of
her
situation
and
found
himself
unable
to
prevent
her
fall
or
even
to
forewarn
her
of
the
peril
for
as
we
have
already
observed
his
soul
could
not
brook
the
thought
of
communicating
the
tidings
of
distress
to
the
monimia
chapter
renaldo
distress
deepens
and
fathom
plot
thickens
such
aggravated
misfortune
could
not
fail
to
affect
his
temper
and
deportment
the
continual
efforts
he
made
to
conceal
his
vexation
produced
a
manifest
distraction
in
his
behaviour
and
discourse
he
began
to
be
seized
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
poor
monimia
whom
he
therefore
shunned
as
much
as
the
circumstances
of
their
correspondence
would
allow
and
every
evening
he
went
forth
alone
to
some
solitary
place
where
he
could
unperceived
give
a
loose
to
the
transports
of
his
sorrow
and
in
silence
meditate
some
means
to
lighten
the
burden
of
his
woe
his
heart
was
sometimes
so
savaged
with
despair
which
represented
mankind
as
his
inveterate
enemies
that
he
entertained
thoughts
of
denouncing
war
against
the
whole
community
and
supplying
his
own
wants
with
the
spoils
he
should
win
at
other
times
he
was
tempted
with
the
desire
of
putting
an
end
to
his
miseries
and
life
together
yet
these
were
but
the
transitory
suggestions
of
temporary
madness
that
soon
yielded
to
the
dictates
of
reason
from
the
execution
of
the
first
he
was
restrained
by
his
own
notions
of
honour
and
morality
and
from
using
the
other
expedient
he
was
deterred
by
his
love
for
monimia
together
with
the
motives
of
philosophy
and
religion
while
in
this
manner
he
secretly
nursed
the
worm
of
grief
that
preyed
upon
his
vitals
the
alteration
in
his
countenance
and
conduct
did
not
escape
the
eyes
of
that
discerning
young
lady
she
was
alarmed
at
the
change
yet
afraid
to
inquire
into
the
source
of
it
for
being
ignorant
of
his
distress
she
could
impute
it
to
no
cause
in
which
her
happiness
was
not
deeply
interested
she
had
observed
his
strained
complaisance
and
extraordinary
emotion
she
had
detected
him
in
repeated
attempts
to
avoid
her
company
and
taken
notice
of
his
regular
excursions
in
the
dark
these
were
alarming
symptoms
to
a
lover
of
her
delicacy
and
pride
she
strove
in
vain
to
put
the
most
favourable
construction
on
what
she
saw
and
finally
imputed
the
effects
of
his
despondence
to
the
alienation
of
his
heart
made
miserable
beyond
expression
by
these
suspicions
she
imparted
them
to
fathom
who
by
this
time
was
in
full
possession
of
her
confidence
and
esteem
and
implored
his
advice
touching
her
conduct
in
such
a
nice
conjuncture
this
artful
politician
who
rejoiced
at
the
effect
of
her
penetration
no
sooner
heard
himself
questioned
on
the
subject
than
he
gave
tokens
of
surprise
and
confusion
signifying
his
concern
to
find
she
had
discovered
what
for
the
honour
of
his
friend
he
wished
had
never
come
to
light
his
behaviour
on
this
occasion
confirmed
her
fatal
conjecture
and
she
conjured
him
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
to
tell
her
if
he
thought
renaldo
heart
had
contracted
any
new
engagement
at
this
question
he
started
with
signs
of
extreme
agitation
and
stifling
an
artificial
sigh
sure
madam
said
he
you
can
not
doubt
the
count
constancy
i
am
confident
he
is
certainly
i
protest
madam
i
am
so
shocked
here
he
made
a
full
pause
as
if
the
conflict
between
his
integrity
and
his
friendship
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
and
summoned
the
moisture
into
either
eye
then
are
my
doubts
removed
cried
the
afflicted
monimia
i
see
your
candour
in
the
midst
of
your
attachment
to
renaldo
and
will
no
longer
torment
you
with
impertinent
interrogations
and
vain
complaints
with
these
words
a
flood
of
tears
gushed
from
her
enchanting
eyes
and
she
instantly
withdrew
into
her
own
apartment
where
she
indulged
her
sorrow
to
excess
nor
was
her
grief
unanimated
with
resentment
she
was
by
birth
nature
and
education
inspired
with
that
dignity
of
pride
which
ennobles
the
human
heart
and
this
by
the
circumstance
of
her
present
dependence
was
rendered
extremely
jealous
and
susceptible
insomuch
that
she
could
not
brook
the
least
shadow
of
indifference
much
less
an
injury
of
such
a
nature
from
the
man
whom
she
had
honoured
with
her
affections
and
for
whom
she
had
disobliged
and
deserted
her
family
and
friends
though
her
love
was
so
unalterably
fixed
on
this
unhappy
youth
that
without
the
continuation
of
reciprocal
regard
her
life
would
have
become
an
unsupportable
burden
even
amidst
all
the
splendour
of
affluence
and
pomp
and
although
she
foresaw
that
when
his
protection
should
cease
she
must
be
left
a
wretched
orphan
in
a
foreign
land
exposed
to
all
the
miseries
of
want
yet
such
was
the
loftiness
of
her
displeasure
that
she
disdained
to
complain
or
even
demand
an
explanation
from
the
supposed
author
of
her
wrongs
while
she
continued
undetermined
in
her
purpose
and
fluctuating
on
this
sea
of
torture
fathom
believing
that
now
was
the
season
for
working
upon
her
passions
while
they
were
all
in
commotion
became
if
possible
more
assiduous
than
ever
about
the
fair
mourner
modelled
his
features
into
a
melancholy
cast
pretended
to
share
her
distress
with
the
most
emphatic
sympathy
and
endeavoured
to
keep
her
resentment
glowing
by
cunning
insinuations
which
though
apparently
designed
to
apologise
for
his
friend
served
only
to
aggravate
the
guilt
of
his
perfidy
and
dishonour
this
pretext
of
friendly
concern
is
the
most
effectual
vehicle
for
the
conveyance
of
malice
and
slander
and
a
man
reputation
is
never
so
mortally
stabbed
as
when
the
assassin
begins
with
the
preamble
of
for
my
own
part
i
can
safely
say
that
no
man
upon
earth
has
a
greater
regard
for
him
than
i
have
and
it
is
with
the
utmost
anguish
and
concern
that
i
see
him
misbehave
in
such
a
manner
then
he
proceeds
to
mangle
his
character
and
the
hearers
concluding
he
is
even
blacker
than
he
is
represented
on
the
supposition
that
the
most
atrocious
circumstances
are
softened
or
suppressed
by
the
tenderness
or
friendship
of
the
accuser
exclaim
good
lack
what
a
wretch
he
must
be
when
his
best
friends
will
no
longer
attempt
to
defend
him
nay
sometimes
these
undertake
his
defence
and
treacherously
betray
the
cause
they
have
espoused
by
omitting
the
reasons
that
may
be
urged
in
his
vindication
both
these
methods
were
practised
by
the
wily
ferdinand
according
to
the
predominant
passion
of
monimia
when
her
indignation
prevailed
he
expatiated
upon
his
love
and
sincere
regard
for
renaldo
which
he
said
had
grown
up
from
the
cradle
to
such
a
degree
of
fervour
that
he
would
willingly
part
with
life
for
his
advantage
he
shed
tears
for
his
apostasy
but
every
drop
made
an
indelible
stain
upon
his
character
and
in
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
swore
notwithstanding
his
fondness
for
renaldo
which
had
become
a
part
of
his
constitution
that
the
young
hungarian
deserved
the
most
infamous
destiny
for
having
injured
such
perfection
at
other
times
when
he
found
her
melted
into
silent
sorrow
he
affected
to
excuse
the
conduct
of
his
friend
he
informed
her
that
the
young
gentleman
temper
had
been
uneven
from
his
infancy
that
frailty
was
natural
to
man
that
he
might
in
time
be
reclaimed
by
he
even
hinted
that
she
might
have
probably
ascribed
to
inconstancy
what
was
really
the
effect
of
some
chagrin
which
he
industriously
concealed
from
his
participation
but
when
he
found
her
disposed
to
listen
to
this
last
suggestion
he
destroyed
the
force
of
it
by
recollecting
the
circumstances
of
his
nocturnal
rambles
which
he
owned
would
admit
of
no
favourable
construction
by
these
means
he
blew
the
coals
of
her
jealousy
and
enhanced
the
value
of
his
own
character
at
the
same
time
for
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
mirror
of
faith
and
integrity
and
the
mind
being
overcharged
with
woe
naturally
seeks
some
confidant
upon
whose
sympathy
it
can
repose
itself
indeed
his
great
aim
was
to
make
himself
necessary
to
her
affliction
and
settle
a
gossiping
correspondence
in
the
familiarity
of
which
he
hoped
his
purpose
would
certainly
be
answered
yet
the
exertion
of
these
talents
was
not
limited
to
her
alone
while
he
laid
these
trains
for
the
hapless
young
lady
he
was
preparing
snares
of
another
kind
for
her
unsuspecting
lover
who
for
the
completion
of
his
misery
about
this
time
began
to
perceive
marks
of
disquiet
and
displeasure
in
the
countenance
and
deportment
of
his
adored
monimia
for
that
young
lady
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
remembered
her
origin
and
over
her
vexation
affected
to
throw
a
veil
of
tranquillity
which
served
only
to
give
an
air
of
disgust
to
her
internal
disturbance
renaldo
whose
patience
and
philosophy
were
barely
sufficient
to
bear
the
load
of
his
other
evils
would
have
been
quite
overwhelmed
with
the
additional
burden
of
monimia
woe
if
it
had
not
assumed
this
appearance
of
disesteem
which
as
he
knew
he
had
not
deserved
it
brought
his
resentment
to
his
assistance
yet
this
was
but
a
wretched
cordial
to
support
him
against
the
baleful
reflections
that
assaulted
him
from
every
quarter
it
operated
like
those
desperate
remedies
which
while
they
stimulate
exhausted
nature
help
to
destroy
the
very
fundamentals
of
the
constitution
he
reviewed
his
own
conduct
with
the
utmost
severity
and
could
not
recollect
one
circumstance
which
could
justly
offend
the
idol
of
his
soul
the
more
blameless
he
appeared
to
himself
in
this
examination
the
less
excusable
did
her
behaviour
appear
he
tasked
his
penetration
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
alteration
he
burned
with
impatience
to
know
it
his
discernment
failed
him
and
he
was
afraid
though
he
knew
not
why
to
demand
an
explanation
his
thoughts
were
so
circumstanced
that
he
durst
not
even
unbosom
himself
to
fathom
though
his
own
virtue
and
friendship
resisted
those
sentiments
that
began
to
intrude
upon
his
mind
with
suggestions
to
the
prejudice
of
our
adventurer
fidelity
nevertheless
unable
to
endure
the
torments
of
such
interesting
suspense
he
at
length
made
an
effort
to
expostulate
with
the
fair
orphan
and
in
an
abrupt
address
the
effect
of
his
fear
and
confusion
begged
to
know
if
he
had
inadvertently
done
anything
to
incur
her
displeasure
monimia
hearing
herself
bluntly
accosted
in
this
unusual
strain
after
repeated
instances
of
his
reserve
and
supposed
inconstancy
considered
the
question
as
a
fresh
insult
and
summoning
her
whole
pride
to
her
assistance
replied
with
affected
tranquillity
or
rather
with
an
air
of
scorn
that
she
had
no
title
to
judge
neither
did
she
pretend
to
condemn
his
conduct
this
answer
so
wide
of
that
tenderness
and
concern
which
had
hitherto
manifested
itself
in
the
disposition
of
his
amiable
mistress
deprived
him
of
all
power
to
carry
on
the
conversation
and
he
retired
with
a
low
bow
fully
convinced
of
his
having
irretrievably
lost
the
place
he
had
possessed
in
her
affection
for
to
his
imagination
warped
and
blinded
by
his
misfortunes
her
demeanour
seemed
fraught
not
with
a
transient
gleam
of
anger
which
a
respectful
lover
would
soon
have
appeased
but
with
that
contempt
and
indifference
which
denote
a
total
absence
of
affection
and
esteem
she
on
the
other
hand
misconstrued
his
sudden
retreat
and
now
they
beheld
the
actions
of
each
other
through
the
false
medium
of
prejudice
and
resentment
to
such
fatal
misunderstandings
the
peace
and
happiness
of
whole
families
often
fall
a
sacrifice
chapter
our
adventurer
becomes
absolute
in
his
power
over
the
passions
of
his
friend
and
effects
one
half
of
his
aim
influenced
by
this
dire
mistake
the
breast
of
those
unhappy
lovers
began
to
be
invaded
with
the
horrors
of
jealousy
the
monimia
endeavoured
to
devour
her
griefs
in
silence
she
in
secret
bemoaned
her
forlorn
fate
without
ceasing
her
tears
flowed
without
intermission
from
night
to
morn
and
from
morn
to
night
she
sought
not
to
know
the
object
for
which
she
was
forsaken
she
meant
not
to
upbraid
her
undoer
her
aim
was
to
find
a
sequestered
corner
in
which
she
could
indulge
her
sorrow
where
she
could
brood
over
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
her
former
felicity
where
she
could
recollect
those
happy
scenes
she
had
enjoyed
under
the
wings
of
her
indulgent
parents
when
her
whole
life
was
a
revolution
of
pleasures
and
she
was
surrounded
with
affluence
pomp
and
admiration
where
she
could
unmolested
dwell
upon
the
wretched
comparison
between
her
past
and
present
condition
and
paint
every
circumstance
of
her
misery
in
the
most
aggravating
colours
that
they
might
make
the
deeper
impression
upon
her
mind
and
the
more
speedily
contribute
to
that
dissolution
for
which
she
ardently
wished
as
a
total
release
from
woe
amidst
these
pinings
she
began
to
loathe
all
sustenance
her
cheeks
grew
wan
her
bright
eyes
lost
their
splendour
the
roses
vanished
from
her
lips
and
her
delicate
limbs
could
hardly
support
their
burden
in
a
word
her
sole
consolation
was
limited
to
the
prospect
of
depositing
her
sorrows
in
the
grave
and
her
only
wish
was
to
procure
a
retreat
in
which
she
might
wait
with
resignation
for
that
happy
period
yet
this
melancholy
comfort
she
could
not
obtain
without
the
advice
and
mediation
of
fathom
whom
she
therefore
still
continued
to
see
and
consult
while
these
consultations
were
held
renaldo
bosom
was
ravaged
with
tempests
of
rage
and
distraction
he
believed
himself
superseded
in
the
affection
of
his
mistress
by
some
favoured
rival
whose
success
rankled
at
his
soul
and
though
he
scarce
durst
communicate
the
suspicion
to
his
own
heart
his
observation
continually
whispered
to
him
that
he
was
supplanted
by
his
friend
fathom
for
monimia
was
totally
detached
from
the
conversation
of
every
other
man
and
he
had
of
late
noted
their
intercourse
with
distempered
eyes
these
considerations
sometimes
transported
him
to
such
a
degree
of
frenzy
that
he
was
tempted
to
sacrifice
them
both
as
traitors
to
gratitude
friendship
and
love
but
such
deliriums
soon
vanished
before
his
honour
and
humanity
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
think
amiss
of
ferdinand
until
some
undoubted
mark
of
his
guilt
should
appear
and
this
was
so
far
from
being
the
case
that
hitherto
there
was
scarce
a
presumption
on
the
contrary
said
he
to
himself
i
am
hourly
receiving
proofs
of
his
sympathy
and
attachment
not
but
that
he
may
be
the
innocent
cause
of
my
mishap
his
superior
qualifications
may
have
attracted
the
eye
and
engaged
the
heart
of
that
inconstant
fair
without
his
being
sensible
of
the
victory
he
has
won
or
perhaps
shocked
at
the
conquest
he
hath
unwillingly
made
he
discourages
her
advances
tries
to
reason
down
her
unjustifiable
passion
and
in
the
meantime
conceals
from
me
the
particulars
out
of
regard
to
my
happiness
and
quiet
under
cover
of
these
favourable
conjectures
our
adventurer
securely
prosecuted
his
scheme
upon
the
unfortunate
monimia
he
dedicated
himself
wholly
to
her
service
and
conversation
except
at
those
times
when
his
company
was
requested
by
renaldo
who
now
very
seldom
exacted
his
attendance
in
his
ministry
about
the
person
of
the
beauteous
orphan
this
cunning
incendiary
mingled
such
awful
regard
such
melting
compassion
as
effectually
screened
him
from
the
suspicion
of
treachery
while
he
widened
the
fatal
breach
between
her
and
her
lover
by
the
most
diabolical
insinuations
he
represented
his
friend
as
a
voluptuary
who
gratified
his
own
appetite
without
the
least
regard
to
honour
or
conscience
and
with
a
show
of
infinite
reluctance
imparted
some
anecdotes
of
his
sensuality
which
he
had
feigned
for
the
purpose
then
he
would
exclaim
in
an
affected
transport
gracious
heaven
is
it
possible
for
any
man
who
has
the
least
title
to
perception
or
humanity
to
injure
such
innocence
and
perfection
for
my
own
part
had
i
been
so
undeservedly
happy
heaven
and
earth
forgive
my
transports
madam
i
can
not
help
seeing
and
admiring
such
divine
attractions
i
can
not
help
resenting
your
wrongs
it
is
the
cause
of
virtue
i
espouse
it
ought
to
be
the
cause
of
every
honest
man
he
had
often
repeated
such
apostrophes
as
these
which
she
ascribed
to
nothing
else
than
sheer
benevolence
and
virtuous
indignation
and
actually
began
to
think
he
had
made
some
impression
upon
her
heart
not
that
he
now
entertained
the
hope
of
an
immediate
triumph
over
her
chastity
the
more
he
contemplated
her
character
the
more
difficult
the
conquest
seemed
to
be
he
therefore
altered
his
plan
and
resolved
to
carry
on
his
operations
under
the
shelter
of
honourable
proposals
foreseeing
that
a
wife
of
her
qualifications
if
properly
managed
would
turn
greatly
to
the
account
of
the
husband
or
if
her
virtue
should
prove
refractory
that
he
could
at
any
time
rid
himself
of
the
encumbrance
by
decamping
without
beat
of
drum
after
he
should
be
cloyed
with
possession
elevated
by
these
expectations
he
one
day
in
the
midst
of
a
preconcerted
rhapsody
importing
that
he
could
no
longer
conceal
the
fire
that
preyed
upon
his
heart
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
lovely
mourner
and
imprinted
a
kiss
on
her
fair
hand
though
he
did
not
presume
to
take
this
liberty
till
after
such
preparation
as
he
thought
had
altogether
extinguished
her
regard
for
melvil
and
paved
the
way
for
his
own
reception
in
room
of
that
discarded
lover
he
had
so
far
overshot
his
mark
that
monimia
instead
of
favouring
his
declaration
started
up
and
retired
in
silence
her
cheeks
glowing
with
shame
and
her
eyes
gleaming
with
indignation
ferdinand
no
sooner
recovered
from
the
confusion
produced
by
this
unexpected
repulse
than
he
saw
the
necessity
of
coming
to
a
speedy
determination
lest
the
offended
fair
one
should
appeal
to
renaldo
in
which
case
they
might
be
mutually
undeceived
to
his
utter
shame
and
confusion
he
therefore
resolved
to
deprecate
her
anger
by
humble
supplications
and
by
protesting
that
whatever
tortures
he
might
suffer
by
suppressing
his
sentiments
she
should
never
again
be
offended
with
a
declaration
of
his
passion
having
thus
appeased
the
gentle
monimia
and
discovered
that
in
spite
of
her
resentment
his
friend
still
kept
possession
of
her
heart
he
determined
to
work
an
effectual
separation
so
as
that
the
young
lady
being
utterly
deserted
by
melvil
should
be
left
altogether
in
his
power
with
this
christian
intention
he
began
to
sadden
his
visage
with
a
double
shade
of
pensive
melancholy
in
the
presence
of
renaldo
to
stifle
a
succession
of
involuntary
sighs
to
answer
from
the
purpose
to
be
incoherent
in
his
discourse
and
in
a
word
to
act
the
part
of
a
person
wrapt
up
in
sorrowful
cogitation
count
melvil
soon
as
he
perceived
these
symptoms
very
kindly
inquired
into
the
cause
of
them
and
was
not
a
little
alarmed
to
hear
the
artful
and
evasive
answers
of
ferdinand
who
without
disclosing
the
source
of
his
disquiet
earnestly
begged
leave
to
retire
into
some
other
corner
of
the
world
roused
by
this
entreaty
the
hungarian
jealousy
awoke
and
with
violent
agitation
he
exclaimed
then
are
my
fears
too
true
my
dear
fathom
i
comprehend
the
meaning
of
your
request
i
have
for
some
time
perceived
an
host
of
horrors
approaching
from
that
quarter
i
know
your
worth
and
honour
i
depend
upon
your
friendship
and
conjure
you
by
all
the
ties
of
it
to
free
me
at
once
from
the
most
miserable
suspense
by
owning
you
have
involuntarily
captivated
the
heart
of
that
unhappy
maiden
to
this
solemn
interrogation
he
made
no
reply
but
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
of
which
he
had
always
a
magazine
at
command
he
repeated
his
desire
of
withdrawing
and
took
god
to
witness
that
what
he
proposed
was
solely
for
the
quiet
of
his
honoured
patron
and
beloved
friend
enough
cried
the
unfortunate
renaldo
the
measure
of
my
woes
is
now
filled
up
so
saying
he
fell
backwards
in
a
swoon
from
which
he
was
with
difficulty
recovered
to
the
sensation
of
the
most
exquisite
torments
during
this
paroxysm
our
adventurer
nursed
him
with
infinite
care
and
tenderness
he
exhorted
him
to
summon
all
his
fortitude
to
his
assistance
to
remember
his
forefathers
and
exert
himself
in
the
imitation
of
their
virtues
to
fly
from
those
bewitching
charms
which
had
enslaved
his
better
part
to
retrieve
his
peace
of
mind
by
reflecting
on
the
inconstancy
and
ingratitude
of
woman
and
amuse
his
imagination
in
the
pursuit
of
honour
and
glory
after
these
admonitions
he
abused
his
ears
with
a
forged
detail
of
the
gradual
advances
made
to
him
by
monimia
and
the
steps
he
had
taken
to
discourage
her
addresses
and
her
virtue
poisoning
the
mind
of
that
credulous
youth
to
such
a
degree
that
in
all
probability
he
would
have
put
a
fatal
period
to
his
own
existence
had
not
fathom
found
means
to
allay
the
rage
of
his
ecstasy
by
the
cunning
arrangement
of
opposite
considerations
he
set
his
pride
against
his
love
he
opposed
his
resentment
to
his
sorrow
and
his
ambition
to
his
despair
notwithstanding
the
balance
of
power
so
settled
among
these
antagonists
so
violent
were
the
shocks
of
their
successive
conflicts
that
his
bosom
fared
like
a
wretched
province
harassed
depopulated
and
laid
waste
by
two
fierce
contending
armies
from
this
moment
his
life
was
nothing
but
an
alternation
of
starts
and
reveries
he
wept
and
raved
by
turns
according
to
the
prevailing
gust
of
passion
food
became
a
stranger
to
his
lips
and
sleep
to
his
eyelids
he
could
not
support
the
presence
of
monimia
her
absence
increased
the
torture
of
his
pangs
and
when
he
met
her
by
accident
he
started
back
with
horror
like
a
traveller
who
chances
to
tread
upon
a
snake
the
poor
afflicted
orphan
worn
to
a
shadow
with
anguish
eager
to
find
some
lowly
retreat
where
she
could
breath
out
her
soul
in
peace
and
terrified
at
the
frantic
behaviour
of
renaldo
communicated
to
fathom
her
desire
of
removing
and
begged
that
he
would
take
a
small
picture
of
her
father
decorated
with
diamonds
and
convert
them
into
money
for
the
expense
of
her
subsistence
this
was
the
last
pledge
of
her
family
which
she
had
received
from
her
mother
who
had
preserved
it
in
the
midst
of
numberless
distresses
and
no
other
species
of
misery
but
that
which
she
groaned
under
could
have
prevailed
upon
the
daughter
to
part
with
it
but
exclusive
of
other
motives
the
very
image
itself
by
recalling
to
her
mind
the
honours
of
her
name
upbraided
her
with
living
in
dependence
upon
a
man
who
had
treated
her
with
such
indignity
and
ingratitude
besides
she
flattered
herself
with
the
hope
that
she
should
not
long
survive
the
loss
of
this
testimonial
our
adventurer
with
many
professions
of
sorrow
and
mortification
at
his
own
want
of
capacity
to
prevent
such
an
alienation
undertook
to
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
and
to
provide
her
with
a
cheap
and
retired
apartment
to
which
he
would
conduct
her
in
safety
though
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
in
the
meantime
however
he
repaired
to
his
friend
renaldo
and
after
having
admonished
him
to
arm
his
soul
with
patience
and
philosophy
declared
that
monimia
guilty
passion
for
himself
could
no
longer
be
kept
within
bounds
that
she
had
conjured
him
in
the
most
pressing
manner
to
assist
her
in
escaping
from
an
house
which
she
considered
as
the
worst
of
dungeons
because
she
was
in
it
daily
exposed
to
the
sight
and
company
of
a
man
whom
she
detested
and
that
she
had
bribed
him
to
compliance
with
her
request
not
only
with
repeated
promises
of
eternal
love
and
submission
but
also
with
the
picture
of
her
father
set
with
diamonds
which
she
had
hitherto
reserved
as
the
last
and
greatest
testimony
of
her
affection
and
esteem
with
these
words
he
presented
the
fatal
pledge
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
youth
upon
whom
it
operated
like
the
poisonous
sight
of
the
basilisk
for
in
an
instant
the
whole
passions
of
his
soul
were
in
the
most
violent
agitation
what
cried
he
in
an
ecstasy
of
rage
is
she
so
abandoned
to
perfidy
so
lost
to
shame
so
damned
to
constancy
to
gratitude
and
virtuous
love
as
to
meditate
the
means
of
leaving
me
without
decency
without
remorse
to
forsake
me
in
my
adversity
when
my
hapless
fortune
can
no
longer
flatter
the
pride
and
vanity
of
her
expectation
o
woman
woman
woman
what
simile
shall
i
find
to
illustrate
the
character
of
the
sex
but
i
will
not
have
recourse
to
vain
complaints
and
feeble
exclamations
by
heaven
she
shall
not
she
shall
not
triumph
in
her
levity
she
shall
not
exult
in
my
distress
no
i
will
rather
sacrifice
her
to
my
just
resentment
to
the
injured
powers
of
love
and
friendship
i
will
act
the
avenging
minister
of
heaven
i
will
mangle
that
fair
bosom
which
contains
so
false
a
heart
i
will
tear
her
to
pieces
and
scatter
those
beauteous
limbs
as
a
prey
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
fathom
who
expected
this
storm
far
from
attempting
to
oppose
its
progress
waited
with
patience
until
its
first
violence
was
overblown
then
assuming
an
air
of
condolence
animated
with
that
resolution
which
a
friend
ought
to
maintain
on
such
occasions
my
dear
count
said
he
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
at
your
emotion
because
i
know
what
an
heart
susceptible
as
yours
must
feel
from
the
apostasy
of
one
who
has
reigned
so
long
the
object
of
your
love
admiration
and
esteem
your
endeavours
to
drive
her
from
your
thoughts
must
create
an
agony
much
more
severe
than
that
which
divorces
the
soul
from
the
body
nevertheless
i
am
so
confident
of
your
virtue
and
your
manhood
as
to
foresee
that
you
will
allow
the
fair
monimia
to
execute
that
resolution
which
she
hath
so
unwisely
taken
to
withdraw
herself
from
your
love
and
protection
believe
me
my
best
friend
and
benefactor
this
is
a
step
in
consequence
of
which
you
will
infallibly
retrieve
your
peace
of
mind
it
may
cost
you
many
bitter
pangs
it
may
probe
your
wounds
to
the
quick
but
those
pangs
will
be
soothed
by
the
gentle
and
salutary
wing
of
time
and
that
probing
will
rouse
you
to
a
due
sense
of
your
own
dignity
and
importance
which
will
enable
you
to
convert
your
attention
to
objects
far
more
worthy
of
your
contemplation
all
the
hopes
of
happiness
you
had
cherished
in
the
possession
of
monimia
are
now
irrecoverably
blasted
her
heart
is
now
debased
beneath
your
consideration
her
love
is
without
all
doubt
extinguished
and
her
honour
irretrievably
lost
insomuch
that
were
she
to
profess
sorrow
for
her
indiscretion
and
implore
your
forgiveness
with
the
most
solemn
promises
of
regarding
you
for
the
future
with
unalterable
fidelity
and
affection
you
ought
not
to
restore
her
to
that
place
in
your
heart
which
she
hath
so
meanly
forfeited
because
you
could
not
at
the
same
time
reinstate
her
in
the
possession
of
that
delicate
esteem
without
which
there
is
no
harmony
no
rapture
no
true
enjoyment
in
love
no
my
dear
renaldo
expel
the
unworthy
tenant
from
your
bosom
allow
her
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
her
ingratitude
by
deserting
her
lover
friend
and
benefactor
your
glory
demands
her
dismission
the
world
will
applaud
your
generosity
and
your
own
heart
approve
of
your
conduct
so
disencumbered
let
us
exert
ourselves
once
more
in
promoting
your
departure
from
this
island
that
you
may
revisit
your
father
house
do
justice
to
yourself
and
amiable
sister
and
take
vengeance
on
the
author
of
your
wrongs
then
dedicate
yourself
to
glory
in
imitation
of
your
renowned
ancestors
and
flourish
in
the
favour
of
your
imperial
patron
these
remonstrances
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
hungarian
that
his
face
was
lighted
up
with
a
transient
gleam
of
satisfaction
he
embraced
ferdinand
with
great
ardour
calling
him
his
pride
his
mentor
his
good
genius
and
entreated
him
to
gratify
the
inclination
of
that
fickle
creature
so
far
as
to
convey
her
to
another
lodging
without
loss
of
time
while
he
would
by
absenting
himself
favour
their
retreat
our
hero
having
obtained
this
permission
went
immediately
to
the
skirts
of
the
town
where
he
had
previously
bespoke
a
small
though
neat
apartment
at
the
house
of
an
old
woman
widow
of
a
french
refugee
he
had
already
reconnoitred
the
ground
by
sounding
his
landlady
from
whose
poverty
and
complaisance
he
found
reason
to
expect
all
sorts
of
freedom
and
opportunity
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
aim
upon
monimia
person
the
room
being
prepared
for
her
reception
he
returned
to
that
disconsolate
beauty
to
whom
he
presented
ten
guineas
which
he
pretended
to
have
raised
by
pledging
the
picture
though
he
himself
acted
as
the
pawnbroker
on
this
occasion
for
a
very
plain
and
obvious
reason
the
fair
orphan
was
overjoyed
to
find
her
wish
so
speedily
accomplished
she
forthwith
packed
up
her
necessaries
in
a
trunk
and
a
was
called
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
in
which
she
embarked
with
her
baggage
and
conductor
yet
she
did
not
leave
the
habitation
of
renaldo
without
regret
in
the
instant
of
parting
the
idea
of
that
unfortunate
youth
was
associated
with
every
object
that
presented
itself
to
her
eyes
not
as
an
inconstant
ungenerous
and
perjured
swain
but
as
the
accomplished
the
virtuous
the
melting
lover
who
had
captivated
her
virgin
heart
as
fathom
led
her
to
the
door
she
was
met
by
renaldo
dog
which
had
long
been
her
favourite
and
the
poor
animal
fawning
upon
her
as
she
passed
her
heart
was
overwhelmed
with
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
that
a
flood
of
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
and
she
had
sunk
upon
the
floor
ferdinand
considering
this
emotion
as
the
last
tribute
she
would
pay
to
renaldo
hurried
her
into
the
coach
where
she
soon
recovered
her
composure
and
in
a
little
time
he
ushered
her
into
the
house
of
madam
la
mer
by
whom
she
was
received
with
great
cordiality
and
conducted
to
her
apartment
with
which
she
found
no
other
fault
than
that
of
its
being
too
good
for
one
in
her
forlorn
situation
here
while
the
tear
of
gratitude
started
in
either
eye
she
thanked
our
adventurer
for
his
benevolence
and
kind
concern
assuring
him
that
she
would
not
fail
duly
to
beseech
the
most
high
to
shower
down
blessings
upon
him
as
the
orphan
friend
and
protector
fathom
was
not
deficient
in
those
expressions
that
were
best
adapted
to
her
present
turn
of
mind
he
observed
that
what
he
had
done
was
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
common
humanity
which
would
have
prompted
him
to
assist
any
in
distress
but
that
her
peculiar
virtue
and
qualifications
were
such
as
challenged
the
utmost
exertion
of
his
faculties
in
her
service
he
said
that
surely
heaven
had
not
created
such
perfection
in
vain
that
she
was
destined
to
receive
as
well
as
to
communicate
happiness
and
that
the
providence
which
she
so
piously
adored
would
not
fail
in
due
season
to
raise
her
from
distress
and
affliction
to
that
honour
and
felicity
for
which
she
was
certainly
ordained
in
the
meantime
he
entreated
her
to
depend
upon
his
service
and
fidelity
and
the
article
of
her
board
being
settled
he
left
her
to
the
company
and
consolation
of
her
discreet
hostess
who
soon
insinuated
herself
into
the
good
opinion
of
her
beauteous
lodger
while
our
hero
was
employed
in
this
transaction
renaldo
sallied
forth
in
a
sort
of
intoxication
which
fathom
admonitions
had
inspired
and
repairing
to
a
certain
noted
engaged
at
chess
with
an
old
french
refugee
that
his
attention
by
being
otherwise
employed
might
not
stray
towards
that
fatal
object
which
he
ardently
wished
to
forget
but
unluckily
for
him
he
had
scarce
performed
three
moves
of
the
game
when
his
ears
were
exposed
to
a
dialogue
between
two
young
gentlemen
one
of
whom
asked
the
other
if
he
would
go
and
see
the
orphan
acted
at
one
of
the
theatres
observing
as
a
farther
inducement
that
the
part
of
monimia
would
be
performed
by
a
young
gentlewoman
who
had
never
appeared
on
the
stage
at
mention
of
that
name
renaldo
started
for
though
it
did
not
properly
belong
to
his
orphan
it
was
the
appellation
by
which
she
had
been
distinguished
ever
since
her
separation
from
her
house
and
therefore
it
recalled
her
to
his
imagination
in
the
most
interesting
point
of
view
though
he
endeavoured
to
expel
the
image
by
a
closer
application
to
his
play
every
now
and
then
it
intruded
upon
his
fancy
and
at
each
return
made
a
stronger
impression
so
that
he
found
himself
in
the
situation
of
an
unfortunate
bark
stranded
upon
some
hidden
rock
which
when
the
wind
begins
to
blow
feels
every
succeeding
wave
more
boisterous
than
the
former
until
with
irresistible
fury
they
surmount
her
deck
sweep
everything
before
them
and
dash
her
all
to
pieces
the
refugee
had
observed
his
first
emotion
which
he
attributed
to
an
unforeseen
advantage
he
himself
had
gained
over
the
hungarian
but
seeing
him
in
the
sequel
bite
his
lip
roll
his
eyes
groan
writhe
his
body
ejaculate
incoherent
curses
and
neglect
his
game
the
huguenot
concluded
that
he
was
mad
and
being
seized
with
terror
and
dismay
got
up
and
scampered
off
without
ceremony
or
hesitation
melvil
thus
left
to
the
horrors
of
his
own
thought
which
tortured
him
with
the
apprehension
of
losing
monimia
for
ever
could
no
longer
combat
that
suggestion
but
ran
homewards
with
all
the
speed
he
could
exert
in
order
to
prevent
her
retreat
when
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
was
struck
with
such
a
damp
of
presaging
fear
that
he
durst
not
in
person
approach
her
apartment
nor
even
by
questioning
the
servant
inform
himself
of
the
particulars
he
wanted
to
know
yet
his
suspense
becoming
more
insupportable
than
his
fear
he
rushed
from
room
to
room
in
quest
of
that
which
was
not
to
be
found
and
seeing
monimia
chamber
door
open
entered
the
deserted
temple
in
a
state
of
distraction
calling
aloud
upon
her
name
all
was
silent
solitary
and
woful
she
is
gone
he
cried
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
she
is
for
ever
lost
and
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
are
fled
so
saying
he
sunk
upon
that
couch
on
which
monimia
had
oft
reposed
and
abandoned
himself
to
all
the
excess
of
grief
and
despondence
in
this
deplorable
condition
he
was
found
by
our
adventurer
who
gently
chid
him
for
his
want
of
resolution
and
again
repelled
his
sorrow
by
arousing
his
resentment
against
the
innocent
cause
of
his
disquiet
having
beforehand
forged
the
particulars
of
provocation
is
it
possible
said
he
that
renaldo
can
still
retain
the
least
sentiment
of
regard
for
a
fickle
woman
by
whom
he
has
been
so
ungratefully
forsaken
and
so
unjustly
scorned
is
it
possible
he
can
be
so
disturbed
by
the
loss
of
a
creature
who
is
herself
lost
to
all
virtue
and
decorum
time
and
reflection
my
worthy
friend
will
cure
you
of
that
inglorious
malady
and
the
future
misconduct
of
that
imprudent
damsel
will
doubtless
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
your
peace
her
behaviour
at
leaving
the
house
where
she
had
received
so
many
marks
of
the
most
delicate
affection
was
in
all
respects
so
opposite
to
honour
and
decency
that
i
could
scarce
refrain
from
telling
her
i
was
shocked
at
her
deportment
even
while
she
loaded
me
with
protestations
of
love
when
a
woman
heart
is
once
depraved
she
bids
adieu
to
all
restraint
she
preserves
no
measures
it
was
not
simply
contempt
which
she
expressed
for
renaldo
she
seems
to
resent
his
being
able
to
live
under
her
disdain
and
that
resentment
stoops
to
objects
unworthy
of
indignation
even
your
dog
was
not
exempted
from
the
effects
of
her
displeasure
for
in
her
passage
to
the
door
she
kicked
the
poor
animal
as
one
of
your
dependents
and
in
our
way
to
the
apartment
i
had
provided
for
her
she
entertained
me
with
a
ludicrous
comment
upon
the
manner
in
which
you
first
made
her
acquainted
with
your
passion
all
that
modesty
of
carriage
all
that
chastity
of
conversation
all
that
dignity
of
grief
which
she
knew
so
well
how
to
affect
is
now
entirely
laid
aside
and
when
i
quitted
her
she
seemed
the
most
gay
giddy
and
impertinent
of
her
sex
gracious
powers
exclaimed
renaldo
starting
from
the
couch
am
i
under
the
delusion
of
a
dream
or
are
these
things
really
so
as
my
friend
has
represented
them
such
a
total
and
sudden
degeneracy
is
amazing
is
monstrous
and
unnatural
such
my
dear
count
replied
our
hero
is
the
caprice
of
a
female
heart
fickle
as
the
wind
uncertain
as
a
calm
at
sea
fixed
to
no
principle
but
swayed
by
every
fantastic
gust
of
passion
or
of
whim
congratulate
yourself
therefore
my
friend
upon
your
happy
deliverance
from
such
a
domestic
plague
upon
the
voluntary
exile
of
a
traitor
from
your
recollect
the
dictates
of
your
duty
your
discretion
and
your
glory
and
think
upon
the
honours
and
elevated
enjoyment
for
which
you
are
certainly
ordained
let
us
over
a
cheerful
bottle
anticipate
your
success
and
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
house
of
an
usurer
who
i
am
informed
fears
no
risk
provided
twenty
per
cent
be
given
and
the
borrower
life
insured
chapter
the
art
of

further
explained
and
an
account
of
a
strange
phenomenon
in
this
manner
did
the
artful
incendiary
work
upon
the
passions
of
the
credulous
unsuspecting
hungarian
who
pressed
him
to
his
breast
with
the
most
cordial
expressions
of
friendship
calling
him
his
guardian
his
saviour
his
second
father
and
gave
himself
up
wholly
to
his
advice
next
morning
according
to
the
plan
they
had
laid
overnight
they
repaired
to
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
person
to
whom
our
adventurer
had
been
directed
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
him
in
the
house
transacting
a
money
affair
with
a
young
gentleman
who
treated
him
with
his
morning
whet
that
affair
being
negotiated
he
adjourned
into
another
room
with
renaldo
and
his
companion
who
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
this
minister
of
plutus
in
the
shape
of
a
young
sprightly
beau
trimmed
up
in
all
the
foppery
of
the
fashion
for
they
had
hitherto
always
associated
with
the
idea
of
an
usurer
old
age
and
rusty
apparel
after
divers
modish
congees
he
begged
to
know
to
what
he
should
attribute
the
honour
of
their
message
when
ferdinand
who
acted
the
orator
told
him
that
his
friend
count
melvil
having
occasion
for
a
sum
of
money
had
been
directed
to
a
gentleman
of
his
name
and
i
suppose
added
he
you
are
the
son
of
the
person
with
whom
the
affair
is
to
be
negotiated
sir
said
this
with
a
smile
i
perceive
you
are
surprised
to
see
one
of
my
profession
in
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
and
perhaps
your
wonder
will
not
cease
when
i
tell
you
that
my
education
was
liberal
and
that
i
once
had
the
honour
to
bear
a
commission
in
the
british
army
i
was
indeed
a
first
lieutenant
of
marines
and
will
venture
to
say
that
no
officer
in
the
service
was
more
delicate
than
myself
in
observing
all
the
punctilios
of
honour
i
entertained
the
utmost
contempt
for
all
the
trading
part
of
the
nation
and
suffered
myself
to
be
run
through
the
body
in
a
duel
rather
than
roll
with
a
who
was
a
broker
son
but
thank
heaven
i
have
long
ago
conquered
all
those
ridiculous
prejudices
i
soon
observed
that
without
money
there
was
no
respect
honour
or
convenience
to
be
acquired
in
life
that
wealth
amply
supplied
the
want
of
wit
merit
and
pedigree
having
influence
and
pleasure
ever
at
command
and
that
the
world
never
failed
to
worship
the
flood
of
affluence
without
examining
the
dirty
channels
through
which
it
commonly
flowed
at
the
end
of
the
war
finding
my
appointments
reduced
to
two
shillings
and
fourpence
per
day
and
being
addicted
to
pleasures
which
i
could
not
possibly
purchase
from
such
a
fund
i
sold
my
for
two
hundred
pounds
which
i
lent
upon
bond
to
a
young
officer
of
the
same
regiment
on
condition
that
he
should
insure
his
life
and
restore
part
of
the
sum
by
way
of
premium
i
happened
to
be
lucky
in
this
first
essay
for
the
borrower
having
in
six
weeks
expended
the
money
made
an
excursion
on
the
highway
was
apprehended
tried
convicted
of
felony
and
cut
his
own
throat
to
prevent
the
shame
of
a
public
execution
so
that
his
bond
was
discharged
by
the
insurers
in
short
gentlemen
when
i
engaged
in
this
business
i
determined
to
carry
it
on
with
such
spirit
as
would
either
make
my
fortune
or
entirely
ruin
me
in
a
little
time
and
hitherto
my
endeavours
have
been
tolerably
successful
nor
do
i
think
my
proceedings
a
whit
more
criminal
or
unjust
than
those
of
other
merchants
who
strive
to
turn
their
money
to
the
best
account
the
commodity
i
deal
in
is
cash
and
it
is
my
business
to
sell
it
to
the
best
advantage
a
london
factor
sends
a
cargo
of
goods
to
market
and
if
he
gets
two
hundred
per
cent
upon
the
sale
he
is
commended
for
industry
and
address
if
i
sell
money
for
part
of
that
profit
certain
persons
will
be
so
unjust
as
to
cry
shame
upon
me
for
taking
such
advantage
of
my
neighbour
distress
not
considering
that
the
trader
took
four
times
the
same
advantage
of
those
people
who
bought
his
cargo
though
his
risk
was
not
half
so
great
as
mine
and
although
the
money
i
sold
perhaps
retrieved
the
borrower
from
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
for
example
it
was
but
yesterday
i
saved
a
worthy
man
from
being
arrested
for
a
sum
of
money
for
which
he
had
bailed
a
friend
who
treacherously
left
him
in
the
lurch
as
he
did
not
foresee
what
would
happen
he
had
made
no
provision
for
the
demand
and
his
sphere
of
life
secluding
him
from
all
sorts
of
monied
intercourse
he
could
not
raise
the
cash
by
his
credit
in
the
usual
way
of
borrowing
so
that
without
my
assistance
he
must
have
gone
to
jail
a
disgrace
which
would
have
proved
fatal
to
the
peace
of
his
family
and
utterly
ruined
his
nay
that
very
young
gentleman
from
whom
i
am
just
now
parted
will
in
all
probability
be
indebted
to
me
for
a
very
genteel
livelihood
he
had
obtained
the
absolute
promise
of
being
provided
for
by
a
great
man
who
sits
at
the
helm
of
affairs
in
a
neighbouring
kingdom
but
being
destitute
of
all
other
resources
he
could
not
have
equipped
himself
for
the
voyage
in
order
to
profit
by
his
intention
unless
i
had
enabled
him
to
pursue
his
good
fortune
renaldo
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
this
harangue
to
which
fathom
replied
with
many
florid
encomiums
upon
the
usurer
good
sense
and
humane
disposition
then
he
explained
the
errand
of
his
friend
which
was
to
borrow
three
hundred
pounds
in
order
to
retrieve
his
inheritance
of
which
he
had
been
defrauded
in
his
absence
sir
said
the
lender
addressing
himself
to
count
melvil
i
pretend
to
have
acquired
by
experience
some
skill
in
physiognomy
and
though
there
are
some
faces
so
deeply
disguised
as
to
baffle
all
the
penetration
of
our
art
there
are
others
in
which
the
heart
appears
with
such
nakedness
of
integrity
as
at
once
to
recommend
it
to
our
goodwill
i
own
your
countenance
prepossesses
me
in
your
favour
and
you
shall
be
accommodated
upon
those
terms
from
which
i
never
deviate
provided
you
can
find
proper
security
that
you
shall
not
quit
the
british
dominions
for
that
with
me
is
a
condition
sine
qua
non
this
was
a
very
disagreeable
declaration
to
renaldo
who
candidly
owned
that
as
his
concerns
lay
upon
the
continent
his
purpose
was
to
leave
england
without
delay
the
usurer
professed
himself
sorry
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
oblige
him
and
in
order
to
prevent
any
further
importunity
assured
them
he
had
laid
it
down
as
a
maxim
from
which
he
would
never
swerve
to
avoid
all
dealings
with
people
whom
if
need
should
be
he
could
not
sue
by
the
laws
of
this
realm
thus
the
intervention
of
one
unlucky
and
unforeseen
circumstance
blasted
in
an
instant
the
budding
hopes
of
melvil
who
while
his
visage
exhibited
the
most
sorrowful
disappointment
begged
to
know
if
there
was
any
person
of
his
acquaintance
who
might
be
less
scrupulous
in
that
particular
the
young
gentleman
directed
them
to
another
member
of
his
profession
and
wishing
them
success
took
his
leave
with
great
form
and
complaisance
this
instance
of
politeness
was
however
no
more
than
a
shift
to
disengage
himself
the
more
easily
from
their
entreaties
for
when
the
case
was
opened
to
the
second
usurer
he
blessed
himself
from
such
customers
and
dismissed
them
with
the
most
mortifying
and
boorish
refusal
notwithstanding
these
repulses
renaldo
resolved
to
make
one
desperate
push
and
without
allowing
himself
the
least
respite
solicited
one
by
one
not
fewer
than
fifteen
persons
who
dealt
in
this
kind
of
traffic
and
his
proposals
were
rejected
by
each
at
last
fatigued
by
the
toil
and
exasperated
at
the
ill
success
of
his
expedition
and
half
mad
with
the
recollection
of
his
finances
which
were
now
drained
to
since
we
have
nothing
to
expect
cried
he
from
the
favour
of
christians
let
us
have
recourse
to
the
descendants
of
judah
though
they
lie
under
the
general
reproach
of
nations
as
a
people
dead
to
virtue
and
benevolence
and
wholly
devoted
to
avarice
fraud
and
extortion
the
most
savage
of
their
tribe
can
not
treat
me
with
more
barbarity
of
indifference
than
i
have
experienced
among
those
who
are
the
authors
of
their
reproach
although
fathom
looked
upon
this
proposal
as
an
extravagant
symptom
of
despair
he
affected
to
approve
of
the
scheme
and
encouraged
renaldo
with
the
hope
of
succeeding
in
another
quarter
even
if
this
expedition
should
fail
for
by
this
time
our
adventurer
was
half
resolved
to
export
him
at
his
own
charge
rather
than
he
should
be
much
longer
restricted
in
his
designs
upon
monimia
meanwhile
being
resolved
to
try
the
experiment
upon
the
children
of
israel
they
betook
themselves
to
the
house
of
a
rich
jew
whose
wealth
they
considered
as
a
proof
of
his
rapaciousness
and
being
admitted
into
his
they
found
him
in
the
midst
of
half
a
dozen
clerks
when
renaldo
in
his
imagination
likened
him
unto
a
minister
of
darkness
surrounded
by
his
familiars
and
planning
schemes
of
misery
to
be
executed
upon
the
hapless
sons
of
men
in
spite
of
these
suggestions
which
were
not
at
all
mitigated
by
the
forbidding
aspect
of
the
hebrew
he
demanded
a
private
audience
and
being
ushered
into
another
apartment
he
explained
his
business
with
manifest
marks
of
disorder
and
affliction
indeed
his
confusion
was
in
some
measure
owing
to
the
looks
of
the
jew
who
in
the
midst
of
this
exordium
pulled
down
his
eyebrows
which
were
surprisingly
black
and
bushy
so
as
in
appearance
totally
to
extinguish
his
visage
though
he
was
all
the
time
observing
our
youth
from
behind
those
almost
impenetrable
thickets
melvil
having
signified
his
request
young
gentleman
said
the
israelite
with
a
most
discordant
voice
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
could
induce
you
to
come
to
me
upon
such
an
errand
did
you
ever
hear
that
i
lent
money
to
strangers
without
security
no
replied
renaldo
nor
did
i
believe
i
should
profit
by
my
application
but
my
affairs
are
desperate
and
my
proposals
having
been
rejected
by
every
christian
to
whom
they
were
offered
i
was
resolved
to
try
my
fate
among
the
jews
who
are
reckoned
another
species
of
men
fathom
alarmed
at
this
abrupt
reply
which
he
supposed
could
not
fail
to
disgust
the
merchant
interposed
in
the
conversation
by
making
an
apology
for
the
plain
dealing
of
his
friend
who
he
said
was
soured
and
ruffled
by
his
misfortunes
then
exerting
that
power
of
eloquence
which
he
had
at
command
he
expostulated
upon
renaldo
claim
and
expectations
described
the
wrongs
he
had
suffered
extolled
his
virtue
and
drew
a
most
pathetic
picture
of
his
distress
the
jew
listened
attentively
for
some
time
then
his
eyebrows
began
to
rise
and
fall
alternately
he
coughed
sneezed
and
winking
hard
plagued
said
he
with
a
salt
rheum
that
trickles
from
my
eyes
without
intermission
so
saying
he
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
face
and
proceeded
in
these
words
sir
your
story
is
plausible
and
your
friend
is
a
good
advocate
but
before
i
give
an
answer
to
your
demand
i
must
beg
leave
to
ask
if
you
can
produce
undeniable
evidence
of
your
being
the
identical
person
you
really
assume
if
you
are
really
the
count
de
melvil
you
will
excuse
my
caution
we
can
not
be
too
much
on
our
guard
against
fraud
though
i
must
own
you
have
not
the
air
of
an
impostor
renaldo
eyes
began
to
sparkle
at
this
preliminary
question
to
which
he
replied
that
he
could
procure
the
testimony
of
the
emperor
minister
to
whom
he
had
occasionally
paid
his
respects
since
his
first
arrival
in
england
if
that
be
the
case
said
the
jew
take
the
trouble
to
call
here
morning
at
eight
and
i
will
carry
you
in
my
own
coach
to
the
house
of
his
excellency
with
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
and
if
he
has
nothing
to
object
against
your
character
or
pretensions
i
will
contribute
my
assistance
towards
your
obtaining
justice
at
the
imperial
court
the
hungarian
was
so
much
confounded
at
this
unexpected
reception
that
he
had
not
power
to
thank
the
merchant
for
his
promised
favour
but
stood
motionless
and
silent
while
the
streams
of
emotion
of
the
heart
was
of
more
weight
with
the
jew
than
the
eloquent
acknowledgment
which
ferdinand
took
the
opportunity
of
making
for
his
friend
and
he
was
fain
to
dismiss
them
a
little
abruptly
in
order
to
prevent
a
second
discharge
of
that
same
rheum
of
which
he
had
already
complained
melvil
recollected
all
that
had
happened
as
a
dream
which
had
no
foundation
in
truth
and
was
all
day
long
in
a
sort
of
delirium
produced
by
the
alternate
gusts
of
hope
and
fear
that
still
agitated
his
bosom
for
he
was
not
yet
without
apprehension
of
being
again
disappointed
by
some
unlucky
occurrence
he
did
not
however
fail
to
be
punctual
to
the
hour
of
his
appointment
when
the
jew
told
him
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
visiting
the
ambassador
because
renaldo
had
been
the
preceding
day
recognised
by
one
of
the
clerks
who
had
been
employed
as
a
purveyor
in
the
imperial
army
and
who
knowing
his
family
confirmed
everything
he
had
alleged
after
breakfast
continued
this
benevolent
israelite
i
will
give
you
an
order
upon
my
banker
for
five
hundred
pounds
that
you
may
be
enabled
to
appear
at
vienna
as
the
son
and
representative
of
count
melvil
and
you
shall
also
be
furnished
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
person
of
some
influence
at
that
court
whose
friendship
and
countenance
may
be
of
some
service
to
your
suit
for
i
am
now
heartily
engaged
in
your
interest
in
consequence
of
the
fair
and
unblemished
character
which
i
find
you
have
hitherto
maintained
the
reader
must
appeal
to
his
own
heart
to
acquire
a
just
idea
of
renaldo
feelings
when
every
tittle
of
these
promises
was
fulfilled
and
the
merchant
refused
to
take
one
farthing
by
way
of
premium
contenting
himself
with
the
slender
security
of
a
personal
bond
he
was
in
truth
overwhelmed
with
the
obligation
and
certainly
disposed
to
believe
that
his
benefactor
was
something
more
than
human
as
for
fathom
his
sentiments
took
a
different
turn
and
he
scrupled
not
to
impute
all
this
kindness
to
some
interested
scheme
the
scope
of
which
he
could
not
at
present
comprehend
after
the
tumults
of
the
young
gentleman
joy
had
subsided
and
he
found
himself
eased
of
that
burdensome
poverty
under
which
he
had
groaned
so
long
his
thoughts
which
before
were
dissipated
upon
the
various
circumstances
of
distress
began
to
collect
themselves
in
a
body
and
to
resume
their
deliberations
upon
a
subject
which
they
had
been
long
accustomed
to
consider
this
was
no
other
than
the
forlorn
monimia
whose
idea
now
emerged
in
his
bosom
being
disencumbered
of
one
part
of
the
load
by
which
it
had
been
depressed
he
mentioned
her
name
to
fathom
with
marks
of
the
most
melting
compassion
deplored
her
apostasy
and
while
he
protested
that
he
had
divorced
her
for
ever
from
his
heart
expressed
an
inclination
to
see
her
once
more
before
his
departure
that
he
might
in
person
exhort
her
to
penitence
and
reformation
our
adventurer
who
dreaded
such
an
interview
as
the
infallible
means
of
his
own
ruin
resisted
the
proposal
with
the
whole
power
of
his
elocution
he
affirmed
that
renaldo
desire
was
a
manifest
proof
that
he
still
retained
part
of
the
fatal
poison
which
that
enchantress
had
spread
within
his
veins
and
that
the
sight
of
her
softened
by
his
reproaches
into
tears
and
affected
contrition
would
dispel
his
resentment
disable
his
manhood
and
blow
the
embers
of
his
former
passion
to
such
a
rage
as
would
hurry
him
on
to
a
reconciliation
which
would
debase
his
honour
and
ruin
his
future
peace
in
a
word
ferdinand
described
the
danger
that
would
attend
the
meeting
in
such
emphatic
terms
that
the

of

besides

he
was

of

consequently
be

not

to
make
himself

for
what
he
had

by

seemed

serene

she
was
the

sat
like

on

smiling
at
grief
after
having
paid

begged
pardon
for
having

some
minutes
in
a
swoon

she
with

wiping
the

from

retrieved
her
tranquillity
and
desired
to
know
by
what
means
renaldo
had
been
enabled
to
undertake
his
journey
into

our
hero
upon
this
occasion
assumed
the
whole
merit
of
having
promoted
the
interest
of
his
friend
by
giving
her
to
understand
that
he
in
consequence
of
an
unforeseen
windfall
had
defrayed

he
observed
that
it
was
not
without

saw

artful

able

could
not

the
most
sensible
chagrin
when

saw

rendered
subservient

and

he
chose
as
the

the
abandoned
woman
for

he
had
forsaken

and
accomplishments
did
not
preserve
her
sacred
from
his
ungrateful
sarcasms
and
unmannerly
ridicule
believe
me
madam
i
was
so
shocked
at
his
conversation
on
that
subject
and
so
much
incensed
at
his
want
of
delicacy
that
my
temper
was
scarce
sufficient
for
the
ceremony
of
parting
and
now
that
my
debt
to
his

have
solemnly
renounced
his
correspondence

she
heard
that
instead
of
betraying
the
least
symptom
of
regret
or
compassion
for
her
unhappy
fate
the
perfidious
youth
had
exulted
over
her
fall
and
even
made
her
a
subject
for
his
mirth
the
blood
revisited
her
faded
cheeks
and
resentment
restored
to
her
eyes
that
poignancy
which
sorrow
had
before
overcome
yet
she
scorned
to
give
speech
to
her
indignation
but
forcing
a
smile
why
should
i
repine
said
she
at

mortifications
of

i
despise

from

will

have
sacrificed
to
a
rigid
punctilio

honour
the
dearest
ideas
of
my

i
beheld
your
unrivalled
charms

deeply
felt
their

while
a

while
i
was
restrained
by
my
niggard
fortune
from
making
a
tender
worthy

combated
with
my
inclinations

without

the

hopeless

now
that

disengaged
and
my

rendered
independent
by

i
was
favoured
with

presume
to
lay
myself
at
the
feet
of
the
adorable
monimia
as
the
most
faithful
of
admirers
whose
happiness
or
misery
wholly
depends
upon
her
nod

idle
gallantry

genuine

imperfect

most
pathetic

not
do
justice

gaze
upon
your
beauty

ravishment
but
i
contemplate
the
graces
of
your
soul
with
such
awful
veneration
that
i
tremble
while
i
approach
you
as
if
my
vows
were
addressed
to
some
superior
being
during
this
declaration
which
was
pronounced
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
monimia
was
successively
agitated
with
shame
anger
and
grief
nevertheless
she
summoned
her
whole
philosophy
to
her
aid
and
with
a
tranquil
though
determined
air
begged
he
would
not
diminish
the
obligations
he
had
already
conferred
by
disturbing
with
such
unseasonable
addresses
a
poor
unhappy
maid
who
had
detached
all
her
thoughts
from
earthly
objects
and
waited
impatiently
for
that
dissolution
which
alone
could
put
a
period
to
her
misfortunes
fathom
imagining
that
these
were
no
other
than
the
suggestions
of
a
temporary
disappointment
and
despondence
which
it
was
his
business
to
oppose
with
all
his
eloquence
and
art
renewed
his
theme
with
redoubled
ardour
and
at
last
became
so
importunate
in
his
desires
that
monimia
provoked
beyond
the
power
of
concealing
her
resentment
said
she
was
heartily
sorry
to
find
herself
under
the
necessity
of
telling
him
that
in
the
midst
of
her
misfortunes
she
could
not
help
remembering
what
she
had
been
then
rising
from
her
seat
with
all
the
dignity
of
displeasure
perhaps
added
she
you
have
forgot
who
was
the
father
of
the
once
happy
monimia
with
these
words
she
retired
into
another
chamber
leaving
our
adventurer
confounded
by
the
repulse
he
had
sustained
not
that
he
was
discouraged
from
prosecuting
his
aim
on
the
contrary
this
rebuff
seemed
to
add
fresh
vigour
to
his
operations
he
now
thought
it
high
time
to
bring
over
madam
la
mer
to
his
interest
and
to
facilitate
her
conversion
took
an
opportunity
of
bribing
her
with
some
inconsiderable
presents
after
having
amused
her
with
a
plausible
tale
of
his
passion
for
monimia
with
whom
she
undertook
the
office
of
his
mediatrix
on
the
supposition
that
his
intentions
were
honourable
and
highly
advantageous
to
her
lodger
she
was
first
of
all
invested
with
the
office
of
obtaining
pardon
for
the
offence
he
had
given
and
in
this
negotiation
she
succeeded
so
well
as
to
become
an
advocate
for
his
suit
accordingly
she
took
all
occasions
of
magnifying
his
praise
his
agreeable
person
was
often
the
subject
of
her
discourse
to
the
fair
mourner
her
admiration
dwelt
upon
his
politeness
good
sense
and
winning
deportment
and
she
every
day
retailed
little
stories
of
his
benevolence
and
greatness
of
soul
the
defect
in
his
birth
she
represented
as
a
circumstance
altogether
foreign
from
the
consideration
of
his
merit
especially
in
a
nation
where
such
distinctions
are
as
little
respected
as
they
will
be
in
a
future
state
she
mentioned
several
persons
of
note
who
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
power
and
fortune
without
having
enjoyed
the
least
hereditary
assistance
from
their
forefathers
one
she
said
sprung
from
the
loins
of
an
obscure
attorney
another
was
the
grandson
of
a
a
third
was
the
issue
of
an
accountant
and
a
fourth
the
offspring
of
a
woollen
draper
all
these
were
the
children
of
their
own
good
works
and
had
raised
themselves
upon
their
personal
virtues
and
address
a
foundation
certainly
more
solid
and
honourable
than
a
vague
inheritance
derived
from
ancestors
in
whose
deserts
they
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
borne
the
least
share
monimia
listened
to
all
these
arguments
with
great
patience
and
affability
though
she
at
once
dived
into
the
source
from
which
all
such
insinuations
flowed
she
joined
in
the
commendations
of
fathom
and
owned
herself
a
particular
instance
of
that
benevolence
which
the
old
lady
had
so
justly
extolled
but
once
for
all
to
prevent
the
supplication
which
madam
la
mer
was
about
to
make
she
solemnly
protested
that
her
heart
was
altogether
shut
against
any
other
earthly
engagement
and
that
her
thoughts
were
altogether
employed
upon
her
eternal
salvation
the
assiduous
landlady
perceiving
the
steadiness
of
her
disposition
thought
proper
to
alter
her
method
of
proceeding
and
for
the
present
suspended
that
theme
by
which
she
found
her
fair
lodger
disobliged
resolved
to
reconcile
monimia
to
life
before
she
would
again
recommend
ferdinand

her
love

endeavoured
to
amuse
her
imagination
by
recounting
the
occasional
incidents
of
the
day

gradually
to
decoy
her
attention
to
those
sublunary
objects
from
which
it
had
been
industriously
weaned

conversation
with
agreeable
sallies

upon
the
different

delicacies

to
shake
her
temperance
with
repeated
proffers
and
recommendations
of
certain
cordials
and
restoratives
which
she
alleged
were
necessary
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
and
pressed
her
to
make
little
excursions
into
the
fields
that
skirt
the

the
benefit
of

and
exercise

now
seemed
to
have
sacrificed

passion

quiet

upon
more
indifferent
subjects

endeavoured
to
dispel
her
melancholy
with
arguments
drawn
from
philosophy
and
religion
on
some
occasions
he
displayed
all
his
fund
of
good
humour
with
a
view
to
beguile
her
sorrow
he
importuned
her
to
give
him
the
pleasure
of
squiring
her
to
some
place
of
innocent
entertainment
and
finally
insisted
upon
her
accepting

pecuniary
reinforcement

refused

equal
obstinacy
and
politeness
and
with
pleasure
saw
herself
wasting
towards
that
period

consummation

her
charms
far
from

baffled

their

became
less
frequent
in
his
visits
and
more
indifferent
in

gradually
relaxed
in
that
complacency
and
respect
with
which
she
had
hitherto
behaved
towards
her
fair

she
even
began
to
drop
hints
of
disapprobation
and
reproach
against
this
pattern
of
innocence
and
beauty
and
at
length
grew
bold
enough
to
tell
her
that
her
misfortunes
could
be
attributed
to
nothing
but
her
own
obstinacy
and
pride
that
she
had
been
at
great
pains
to
disoblige
the
only
person
who
was
able
and
willing
to
raise
her
above
dependence

that
if

be
withdrawn
she
must
be
exposed
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
distress
these
insinuations
instead
of
producing
the
desired
effect
inflamed
the
indignation
of
monimia
who
in
a
most
dignified
style
of
rebuke
chid
her
for
her
indelicacy
and
presumption
observing
that
she
could
have
no
title
to
take
such
freedoms
with
lodgers
whose
punctuality
and
regular
deportment
left
her
no
room
to
complain
notwithstanding
this
animated
reply
she
underwent
the
most
deplorable
anguish
when
she
reflected
upon
the
insolence
of
this
woman
from
whose
barbarity
she
had
no
resource
and
seeing
no
other
possibility
of
redress
than
that
of
appealing
to
the
good
offices
of

conquered
her
reluctance
so
far
as
to
complain
to

with
this
application
he
gave
her
to
understand
with
very
little
ceremony
or

that
it
wholly
depended
upon
herself
whether
she
should
continue
to
be
wretched
or
be
delivered
at
once
from
all
her
cares
and
perplexity
that
notwithstanding
the
disdain
with
which
she
had
treated
his
addresses
he
was
still
ready
to
lay
himself
and
his
fortune
at
her
feet
and
that
if
she
should
again
reject
the
disinterested
proposal
the
whole
world
and
her
own
conscience
would
charge
upon
herself
whatever
calamities
she
might
be
subjected

into
a
favourable
hesitation
her
silence
which
was
the
result
of
wrath
and
amazement
he
proceeded
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
and
utter
a
romantic
rhapsody
in
the
course
of
which
laying
aside
all
that
restraint
which
he
had
hitherto
preserved
he
seized
her
delicate
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
nay
so
far
did
he
forget
himself
on
this
occasion
that
he
caught
the
fair
creature
in
his
arms
and
rudely
ravished
a
kiss
from
those
lips
which
he
had
before
contemplated
with
the
most
distant
reverence
of
desire
having
thus
broken
down
the
fences
of
decorum
and
being
heated
with
transport
he
in
all
probability
would
have
acted
the
part
of
young
tarquin
and
violated
by
force
that
sacred
shrine
of
honour
beauty
and
unblemished
truth
had
not
the
wrath
kindled
by
such
an
unexpected
outrage
inspired
her
with
strength
and
spirits
sufficient
to
protect
her
virtue
and
intimidate
the
ruffian
who
could
offer
violence
to
such
perfection
she
broke
from
his
detested
embrace
with
surprising
agility
and
called
aloud
to
her
landlady
for
assistance
but
that
discreet
matron
was
resolved
to
hear
nothing
and
fathom
appetite
being
whetted
to
a
most
brutal
degree
of
eagerness
madam
said
he
all
opposition
is
vain
what
you
have
refused
to
my
entreaties
you
shall
yield
to
my
power
and
i
am
determined
to
force
you
to
your
own
advantage
so
saying
he
sprung
towards
her
with
the
most
savage
and
impious
intent
when
this
amiable
heroine
snatching
up
his
sword
which
lay
upon
a
and
unsheathing
it
instantaneously
presented
the
point
to
his
breast
and
while
her
eyes
glanced
with
intolerable
keenness
villain
cried
she
the
spirit
of
my
father
animates
my
bosom
and
the
vengeance
of
heaven
shall
not
be
frustrated
he
was
not
so
much
affected
by
his
bodily
danger
as
awestruck
at
the
manner
of
her
address
and
the
appearance
of
her
aspect
which
seemed
to
shine
with
something
supernatural
and
actually
disordered
his
whole
faculties
insomuch
that
he
retreated
without
attempting
to
make
the
least
reply
and
she
having
secured
the
door
after
his
departure
sat
down
to
ponder
upon
this
shocking
event
words
are
wanting
to
describe
the
accumulated
horrors
that
took
possession
of
her
mind
when
she
thus
beheld
all
her
presaging
fears
realised
and
found
herself
at
the
mercy
of
two
wretches
who
had
now
pulled
off
the
mask
after
having
lost
all
sentiments
of
humanity
common
affliction
was
an
agreeable
reverie
to
what
she
suffered
deprived
of
her
parents
exiled
from
her
friends
and
country
reduced
to
the
brink
of
wanting
the
most
indispensable
necessaries
of
life
in
a
foreign
land
where
she
knew
not
one
person
to
whose
protection
she
could
have
recourse
from
the
inexpressible
woes
that
environed
her
she
complained
to
heaven
that
her
life
was
protracted
for
the
augmentation
of
that
misery
which
was
already
too
severe
to
be
endured
for
she
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
being
utterly
abandoned
in
the
last
stage
of
mortality
without
one
friend
to
close
her
eyes
or
do
the
last
offices
of
humanity
to
her
breathless
corse
these
were
dreadful
reflections
to
a
young
lady
who
had
been
born
to
affluence
and
splendour
trained
up
in
all
the
elegance
of
education
by
nature
fraught
with
that
sensibility
which
refines
the
sentiment
and
taste
and
so
tenderly
cherished
by
her
indulgent
parents
that
they
suffered
not
the
winds
of
heaven
to
visit
her
face
too
roughly
having
passed
the
night
in
such
agony
she
rose
at
daybreak
and
hearing
the
chapel
bell
toll
for
morning
prayers
resolved
to
go
to
this
place
of
worship
in
order
to
implore
the
assistance
of
heaven
she
no
sooner
opened
her
chamber
door
with
this
intent
than
she
was
met
by
madam
la
mer
who
after
having
professed
her
concern
for
what
had
happened
overnight
and
imputed
fathom
rudeness
to
the
spirit
of
intoxication
by
which
she
had
never
before
seen
him
possessed
she
endeavoured
to
dissuade
monimia
from
her
purpose
by
observing
that
her
health
would
be
prejudiced
by
the
cold
morning
air
but
finding
her
determined
she
insisted
upon
accompanying
her
to
chapel
on
pretence
of
respect
though
in
reality
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
escape
of
her
beauteous
lodger
thus
attended
the
hapless
mourner
entered
the
place
and
according
to
the
laudable
hospitality
of
england
which
is
the
only
country
in
christendom
where
a
stranger
is
not
made
welcome
to
the
house
of
god
this
amiable
creature
emaciated
and
enfeebled
as
she
was
must
have
stood
in
a
common
passage
during
the
whole
service
had
not
she
been
perceived
by
a
humane
gentlewoman
who
struck
with
her
beauty
and
dignified
air
and
melted
with
sympathy
at
the
ineffable
sorrow
which
was
visible
in
her
countenance
opened
the
pew
in
which
she
sat
and
accommodated
monimia
and
her
attendant
if
she
was
captivated
by
her
first
appearance
she
was
not
less
affected
by
the
deportment
of
her
fair
guest
which
was
the
pattern
of
genuine
devotion
in
a
word
this
good
lady
who
was
a
merchant
widow
in
opulent
circumstances
was
inflamed
with
a
longing
desire
to
know
and
befriend
the
amiable
stranger
who
after
service
turning
about
to
thank
her
for
her
civility
madam
clement
with
that
frankness
which
is
the
result
of
true
benevolence
told
her
she
was
too
much
prepossessed
in
her
favour
to
let
slip
this
opportunity
of
craving
her
acquaintance
and
of
expressing
her
inclination
to
alleviate
if
possible
that
affliction
which
was
manifest
in
her
looks
monimia
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
and
surprise
at
this
unexpected
address
gazed
upon
the
lady
in
silence
and
when
she
repeated
her
tenders
of
service
could
make
no
other
reply
to
her
goodness
than
by
bursting
into
a
flood
of
tears
this
was
a
species
of
eloquence
which
did
not
pass
unregarded
by
madam
clement
who
while
her
own
eyes
were
bedewed
with
the
drops
of
sympathy
and
compassion
took
the
lovely
orphan
by
the
hand
and
led
her
without
further
ceremony
to
her
own
coach
that
stood
waiting
at
the
door
whither
they
were
followed
by
la
mer
who
was
so
much
confounded
at
the
adventure
that
she
made
no
objections
to
the
proposal
of
the
lady
who
handed
her
lodger
into
the
carriage
but
retired
with
all
possible
despatch
to
make
fathom
acquainted
with
this
unforeseen
event
meanwhile
the
agitation
of
monimia
at
this
providential
deliverance
was
such
as
had
destroyed
her
tender
frame
the
blood
flushed
and
forsook
her
cheeks
by
turns
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
notwithstanding
the
consolatory
assurances
of
madam
clement
and
without
being
able
to
utter
one
word
was
conducted
to
the
house
of
that
kind
benefactress
where
the
violence
of
her
transports
overpowered
her
constitution
and
she
sunk
down
upon
a
couch
in
a
swoon
from
which
she
was
not
easily
recovered
this
affecting
circumstance
augmented
the
pity
and
interested
the
curiosity
of
madam
clement
who
concluded
there
was
something
very
extraordinary
in
the
case
of
the
stranger
to
produce
these
agonies
and
grew
impatient
to
hear
the
particulars
of
her
story
monimia
no
sooner
retrieved
the
use
of
her
faculties
than
looking
around
and
observing
with
what
humane
concern
her
new
hostess
was
employed
in
effecting
her
recovery
is
this
said
she
a
flattering
illusion
of
the
brain
or
am
i
really
under
the
protection
of
some
beneficent
being
whom
heaven
hath
inspired
with
generosity
to
rescue
an
hapless
stranger
from
the
most
forlorn
state
of
misery
and
woe
her
voice
was
at
all
times
ravishingly
sweet
and
this
exclamation
was
pronounced
with
such
pathetic
fervour
that
madam
clement
clasped
her
in
her
arms
and
kissing
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
maternal
affection
yes
cried
she
fair
creature
heaven
hath
bestowed
upon
me
an
heart
to
compassionate
and
power
i
hope
to
lighten
the
burden
of
your
sorrows
she
then
prevailed
upon
her
to
take
some
nourishment
and
afterwards
to
recount
the
particulars
of
her
fate
a
task
she
performed
with
such
accuracy
and
candour
that
madam
clement
far
from
suspecting
her
sincerity
saw
truth
and
conviction
in
every
circumstance
of
her
tale
and
having
condoled
her
misfortunes
entreated
her
to
forget
them
or
at
least
look
upon
herself
as
one
sheltered
under
the
care
and
tuition
of
a
person
whose
study
it
would
be
to
supply
her
want
of
natural
parents
this
would
have
been
an
happy
vicissitude
of
fortune
had
it
not
arrived
too
late
but
such
a
sudden
and
transition
not
only
disordered
the
faculties
of
poor
monimia
mind
but
also
overpowered
the
organs
of
her
body
already
fatigued
and
enfeebled
by
the
distresses
she
had
undergone
so
that
she
was
taken
ill
of
a
fever
that
same
night
and
became
delirious
before
morning
when
a
physician
was
called
to
her
assistance
while
this
gentleman
was
in
the
house
madam
clement
was
visited
by
fathom
who
after
having
complained
in
the
most
insinuating
manner
that
she
had
encouraged
his
wife
to
abandon
her
duty
told
her
a
plausible
story
of
his
first
acquaintance
with
monimia
and
his
marriage
at
the
fleet
which
he
said
he
was
ready
to
prove
by
the
evidence
of
the
clergyman
who
joined
them
and
that
of
la
mer
who
was
present
at
the
ceremony
the
good
lady
although
a
little
staggered
at
the
genteel
appearance
and
engaging
address
of
this
stranger
could
not
prevail
upon
herself
to
believe
that
she
had
been
imposed
upon
by
her
fair
lodger
who
by
this
time
had
given
too
convincing
a
proof
of
her
sincerity
nevertheless
in
order
to
prevent
any
dispute
that
might
be
prejudicial
to
the
health
or
recovery
of
monimia
she
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
would
not
at
present
enter
upon
the
merits
of
the
cause
but
only
assure
him
that
the
young
lady
was
actually
bereft
of
her
senses
and
in
imminent
danger
of
her
life
for
the
truth
of
which
assertions
she
would
appeal
to
his
own
observation
and
the
opinion
of
the
physician
who
was
then
employed
in
writing
a
prescription
for
the
cure
of
her
disease
so
saying
she
conducted
him
into
the
chamber
where
he
beheld
the
hapless
virgin
stretched
upon
a
panting
under
the
violence
of
a
distemper
too
mighty
for
her
weakly
frame
her
hair
dishevelled
and
discomposure
in
her
looks
all
the
roses
of
her
youth
were
faded
yet
all
the
graces
of
her
beauty
were
not
fled
she
retained
that
sweetness
and
symmetry
which
death
itself
could
not
destroy
and
though
her
discourse
was
incoherent
her
voice
was
still
musical
resembling
those
feathered
songsters
who
warble
their
native
wild
fathom
as
upon
all
other
occasions
so
on
this
did
behave
like
an
inimitable
actor
he
ran
to
the
bedside
with
all
the
trepidation
of
a
distracted
lover
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
while
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
imprinted
a
thousand
kisses
on
the
soft
hand
of
monimia
who
regarding
him
with
a
and
undistinguishing
eye
alas
renaldo
said
she
we
were
born
to
be
unhappy
would
to
heaven
cried
ferdinand
in
a
transport
of
grief
the
wretch
renaldo
had
never
been
born
that
is
the
villain
who
seduced
the
affection
of
this
unfortunate
woman
i
admitted
the
traitor
into
my
friendship
and
confidence
relieved
him
in
his
necessities
and
like
the
ungrateful
viper
he
hath
stung
the
very
bosom
that
cherished
him
in
his
distress
then
he
proceeded
to
inform
madam
clement
how
he
had
delivered
that
same
renaldo
from
prison
maintained
him
afterwards
at
a
great
expense
and
at
length
furnished
him
with
a
sum
of
money
and
proper
credentials
to
support
his
interest
at
the
court
of
vienna
having
finished
this
detail
he
asked
the
physician
sentiments
of
his
wife
distemper
and
being
told
that
her
life
was
in
extreme
jeopardy
begged
he
would
use
his
utmost
endeavours
in
her
behalf
and
even
made
him
a
tender
of
an
extraordinary
fee
which
was
refused
he
also
thanked
madam
clement
for
her
charity
and
benevolence
towards
a
stranger
and
took
his
leave
with
many
polite
professions
of
gratitude
and
esteem
he
had
no
sooner
quitted
the
house
than
the
physician
who
was
a
humane
man
and
a
foreigner
began
to
caution
the
lady
against
his
insinuations
observing
that
some
circumstances
of
the
story
concerning
renaldo
were
to
his
particular
knowledge
contrary
to
truth
for
that
he
himself
had
been
applied
to
for
letters
of
recommendation
in
behalf
of
count
melvil
by
a
jew
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
supplied
the
young
gentleman
with
money
sufficient
for
his
occasions
in
consequence
of
a
minute
inquiry
he
had
made
into
the
character
of
renaldo
who
was
by
all
reports
a
youth
of
strict
honour
and
untainted
morals
madam
clement
thus
cautioned
entered
into
deliberation
with
her
own
thoughts
and
comparing
the
particulars
of
this
account
with
those
of
monimia
own
story
she
concluded
that
fathom
was
the
very
traitor
he
himself
had
described
and
that
he
had
by
abusing
the
confidence
of
both
effected
a
fatal
breach
between
two
innocent
and
deserving
lovers
she
accordingly
looked
upon
him
with
horror
and
detestation
but
nevertheless
resolved
to
treat
him
with
civility
in
the
meantime
that
the
poor
young
lady
might
not
be
disturbed
in
her
last
moments
for
she
had
now
lost
all
hopes
of
her
recovery
yet
the
fever
abated
and
in
two
days
she
retrieved
the
use
of
her
reason
though
the
distemper
had
affected
her
lungs
and
she
was
in
all
appearance
doomed
to
linger
a
few
weeks
longer
in
a
consumption
fathom
was
punctual
in
his
visitation
though
never
admitted
into
her
presence
after
the
delirium
vanished
and
he
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
conveyed
in
a
chariot
to
kensington
gravel
pits
a
place
which
may
be
termed
the
last
stage
of
many
a
mortal
peregrination
he
now
implicitly
believed
that
death
would
in
a
few
days
baffle
all
his
designs
upon
the
unfortunate
monimia
and
foreseeing
that
as
he
had
owned
himself
her
husband
he
might
be
obliged
to
defray
the
expenses
incurred
by
her
sickness
and
burial
he
very
prudently
intermitted
in
his
visits
and
had
recourse
to
the
intelligence
of
his
auxiliary
as
for
monimia
she
approached
the
goal
of
life
not
simply
with
resignation
but
with
rapture
she
enjoyed
in
tranquillity
the
conversation
of
her
kind
benefactress
who
never
stirred
from
her
apartment
she
was
blessed
with
the
spiritual
consolation
of
a
worthy
clergyman
who
removed
all
her
religious
scruples
and
she
congratulated
herself
on
the
near
prospect
of
that
land
of
peace
where
sorrow
is
not
known
at
length

interment
upon
which
these
two
virtuous
associates
took
possession
of
a
place
from
whence
they
could
unperceived
behold
the
funeral
he
must
have
a
hard
heart
who
without
an
emotion
of
pity
can
see
the
last
offices
performed
to
a
young
creature
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
even
though
he
knows
not
her
name
and
is
an
utter
stranger
to
her
virtues
how
callous
then

time
in
bewailing
his
miscarriage
but
had
immediate
recourse
to
other
means
of
improving
his
small
fortune
which
at
this
period
amounted
to
near
two
hundred
pounds
whatever
inclination
he
had
to
resume
the
character
he
had
formerly
borne
in
the
polite
world
he
durst
not
venture
to
launch
out
again
into
the
expense
necessary
to
maintain
that
station
because
his
former
resources
were
now
stopped
and
all
the
people
of
fashion
by
this
time
convinced
of
his
being
a
needy
adventurer
nevertheless
he
resolved
to
sound
the
sentiments
of
his
old
friends
at
a
distance
and
judge
from
the
reception
he
should
meet
with
how
far
he
might
presume
upon
their
countenance
and
favour
for
he
rightly
supposed
that
if
he
could
in
any
shape
contribute
to
their
interest
or
amusement
they
would
easily
forgive
his
former
pretensions
to
quality
arrogant
as
they
were
and
still
entertain
him
on
the
footing
of
a
necessary
acquaintance
with
this
view
he
one
day
presented
himself
at
court
in
a
very
gay
suit
of
clothes
and
bowed
at
a
distance
to
many
of
his
old
fashionable
friends
of
both
sexes
not
one
of
whom
favoured
him
with
any
other
notice
than
that
of
a
quarter
curtsey
or
slight
inclination
of
the
head
for
by
this
time
the
few
that
remembered
him
knew
from
what
retirement
he
now
emerged
and
avoided
him
accordingly
as
the
jail
infection
but
the
greater
part
of
those
who
had
cultivated
him
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortune
were
now
utter
strangers
to
his
person
which
they
had
actually
forgot
amidst
the
succession
of
novelties
that
surrounded
them
or
if
they
did
recollect
his
name
it
was
remembered
as
an
old
fashion
which
had
been
many
months
out
of
date
notwithstanding
these
mortifying
discouragements
our
hero
that
same
evening
effected
a
lodgment
in
a
certain
not
far
from
james
and
as
he
played
pretty
high
and
made
a
parade
of
his
ready
money
he
was
soon
recognised
by
divers
persons
of
consequence
who
cordially
welcomed
him
to
england
on
pretence
of
believing
he
had
been
abroad
and
with
great
complacency
repeated
their
former
professions
of
friendship
though
this
was
a
certain
way
of
retaining
the
favour
of
those
worthies
while
his
finances
continued
to
flourish
and
his
payments
were
prompt
he
knew
the
weakness
of
his
funds
too
well
to
think
they
could
bear
the
vicissitudes
of
play
and
the
remembrance
of
the
two
british
knights
who
had
spoiled
him
at
paris
hung
over
his
imagination
with
the
most
frightful
presages
besides
he
perceived
that
gaming
was
now
managed
in
such
a
manner
as
rendered
skill
and
dexterity
of
no
advantage
for
the
spirit
of
play
having
overspread
the
land
like
a
pestilence
raged
to
such
a
degree
of
madness
and
desperation
that
the
unhappy
people
who
were
infected
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
amusement
economy
or
caution
and
risked
their
fortunes
upon
issues
equally
extravagant
childish
and
absurd
the
whole
mystery
of
the
art
was
reduced
to
the
simple
exercise
of
tossing
up
a
guinea
and
the
lust
of
laying
wagers
which
they
indulged
to
a
surprising
pitch
of
ridiculous
intemperance
in
one
corner
of
the
room
might
be
heard
a
pair
of
lordlings
running
their
grandmothers
against
each
other
that
is
betting
sums
on
the
longest
liver
in
another
the
success
of
the
wager
depended
upon
the
sex
of
the
next
child
and
one
of
the
waiters
happening
to
drop
down
in
an
apoplectic
fit
a
certain
noble
peer
exclaimed
dead
for
a
thousand
pounds
the
challenge
was
immediately
accepted
and
when
the
master
of
the
house
sent
for
a
surgeon
to
attempt
the
cure
the
nobleman
who
set
the
price
upon
the
patient
head
insisted
upon
his
being
left
to
the
efforts
of
nature
alone
otherwise
the
wager
should
be
void
nay
when
the
landlord
harped
upon
the
loss
he
should
sustain
by
the
death
of
a
trusty
servant
his
lordship
obviated
the
objection
by
desiring
that
the
fellow
might
be
charged
in
the
bill
in
short
the
rage
of
gaming
seemed
to
have
devoured
all
their
other
faculties
and
to
have
equalled
the
rash
enthusiasm
of
the
inhabitants
of
malacca
in
the
east
indies
who
are
so
possessed
with
that
pernicious
spirit
that
they
sacrifice
to
it
not
only
their
fortunes
but
also
their
wives
and
children
and
then
letting
their
hair
down
upon
their
shoulders
in
imitation
of
the
ancient
lacedaemonians
when
they
devoted
themselves
to
death
those
wretches
unsheathe
their
daggers
and
murder
every
living
creature
in
their
way
in
this
however
they
differ
from
the
gamesters
of
our
country
who
never
find
their
senses
until
they
have
lost
their
fortunes
and
beggared
their
families
whereas
the
malays
never
run
amuck
but
in
consequence
of
misery
and
despair
such
are
the
amusements
or
rather
such
is
the
continual
employment
of
those
hopeful
youths
who
are
destined
by
birth
to
be
the
judges
of
our
property
and
pillars
of
our
constitution
such
are
the
heirs
and
representatives
of
those
patriots
who
planned
and
those
heroes
who
maintained
the
laws
and
freedom
of
their
country
who
were
the
patrons
of
merit
the
fathers
of
the
poor
the
terror
of
vice
and
immorality
and
at
once
the
ornaments
and
support
of
a
happy
nation
our
adventurer
considered
all
these
circumstances
with
his
wonted
sagacity
and
seeing
upon
what
precarious
footing
he
must
stand
should
he
rank
himself
with
such
society
he
wisely
came
to
the
resolution
of
descending
one
step
in
the
degrees
of
life
and
of
taking
upon
him
the
title
of
physician
under
which
he
did
not
despair
of
insinuating
himself
into
the
pockets
of
his
patients
and
into
the
secrets
of
private
families
so
as
to
acquire
a
comfortable
share
of
practice
or
captivate
the
heart
of
some
heiress
or
rich
widow
whose
fortune
would
at
once
render
him
independent
and
happy
after
this
determination
his
next
care
was
to
concert
measures
for
his
first
appearance
in
this
new
character
well
knowing
that
the
success
of
a
physician
in
a
great
measure
depends
upon
the
external
equipage
in
which
he
first
declares
himself
an
adept
in
the
healing
art
he
first
of
all
procured
a
few
books
on
the
subject
of
medicine
which
he
studied
with
great
attention
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
winter
and
spring
and
repaired
to
tunbridge
with
the
first
of
the
season
where
he
appeared
in
the
uniform
of
aesculapius
namely
a
plain
suit
full
trimmed
with
a
voluminous
believing
that
in
this
place
he
might
glide
as
it
were
imperceptibly
into
the
functions
of
his
new
employment
and
gradually
accustom
himself
to
the
method
and
form
of
prescription
a
man
so
well
known
in
the
gay
world
could
not
be
supposed
to
effect
such
a
transformation
without
being
observed
and
therefore
in
order
to
anticipate
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
those
who
might
be
tempted
to
make
themselves
merry
at
his
expense
he
on
his
arrival
at
the
wells
repaired
to
the
shop
of
an
apothecary
and
calling
for
pen
ink
and
paper
wrote
a
prescription
which
he
desired
might
be
immediately
made
up
while
this
was
doing
by
the
servant
he
was
invited
into
a
parlour
by
the
master
with
whom
he
entered
into
conversation
touching
the
properties
of
the
tunbridge
water
which
seemed
to
have
been
his
particular
study
and
indeed
he
had
perused
rouzee
treatise
on
that
subject
with
indefatigable
assiduity
from
this
theme
he
made
digressions
into
other
parts
of
medicine
upon
which
he
spoke
with
such
plausible
elocution
that
the
apothecary
whose
knowledge
in
that
art
was
not
very
profound
looked
upon
him
as
a
physician
of
great
learning
and
experience
and
hinted
a
desire
of
knowing
his
name
and
situation
fathom
accordingly
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
studied
physic
and
taken
his
degrees
at
padua
rather
for
his
amusement
than
with
any
view
of
exercising
medicine
as
he
then
could
not
possibly
foresee
the
misfortunes
which
had
since
happened
to
his
family
and
by
which
he
was
now
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
a
profession
that
was
very
much
beneath
the
expectations
of
his
birth
yet
he
bore
his
disappointments
with
resignation
and
even
and
blessed
his
stars
for
having
inclined
him
to
the
study
of
any
branch
of
knowledge
by
which
he
might
be
enabled
to
laugh
at
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
he
then
observed
that
he
had
practised
with
some
applause
at
the
hot
well
near
bristol
before
he
thought
he
should
be
ever
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
taking
a
fee
and
that
in
all
probability
his
metamorphosis
when
known
would
furnish
matter
of
surprise
and
merriment
to
some
of
his
old
acquaintance
the
apothecary
was
equally
struck
with
his
polite
address
and
pleased
with
his
agreeable
discourse
he
consoled
him
for
the
misfortunes
of
his
family
by
assuring
him
that
in
england
nothing
could
be
more
honourable
or
indeed
profitable
than
the
character
of
a
physician
provided
he
could
once
wriggle
himself
into
practice
and
insinuated
that
although
he
was
restricted
by
certain
engagements
with
other
persons
of
the
faculty
he
should
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
show
his
regard
for
doctor
fathom
this
was
a
very
effectual
method
which
our
hero
took
to
intimate
his
new
character
to
the
public
by
the
industry
and
communicative
disposition
of
the
apothecary
it
was
circulated
in
half
a
day
through
every
family
in
the
place
and
next
morning
when
ferdinand
appeared
the
company
forthwith
assembled
in
separate
groups
and
from
each
knot
he
heard
his
name
reverberated
in
a
whisper
having
thus
announced
himself
to
all
whom
it
might
concern
and
allowed
the
ladies
two
days
to
discuss
the
merit
of
his
transfiguration
together
with
the
novelty
of
the
case
he
ventured
to
salute
at
a
distance
a
lady
and
her
daughter
who
had
been
his
patients
at
the
hot
well
and
although
they
honoured
his
bow
with
the
return
of
a
slight
curtsey
they
gave
him
not
the
least
encouragement
to
make
a
nearer
approach
notwithstanding
this
rebuff
he
concluded
that
should
the
health
of
either
come
in
question
they
would
renew
their
application
to
his
skill
and
what
was
refused
by
their
pride
would
be
granted
by
their
apprehension
here
however
he
happened
to
be
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
the
young
lady
being
seized
with
a
violent
headache
and
palpitation
her
mother
desired
the
apothecary
to
recommend
a
physician
and
the
person
with
whom
he
was
contracted
being
at
that
time
absent
he
proposed
doctor
fathom
as
a
man
of
great
ability
and
discretion
but
the
good
lady
rejected
the
proposal
with
disdain
because
she
had
formerly
known
him
in
the
character
of
a
count
though
that
very
character
was
the
chief
reason
that
had
then
induced
her
to
crave
his
advice
such
is
the
caprice
of
the
world
in
general
that
whatever
bears
the
face
of
novelty
captivates
or
rather
bewitches
the
imagination
and
confounds
the
ideas
of
reason
and
common
sense
if
for
example
a
scullion
from
the
clinking
of
pewter
shall
conceive
a
taste
for
the
clinking
of
rhyme
and
make
shift
to
bring
together
twenty
syllables
so
as
that
the
tenth
and
last
shall
have
the
like
ending
the
composition
is
immediately
extolled
as
a
miracle
and
what
appeals
to
the
admiration
is
not
the
wit
the
elegance
or
poetry
of
the
work
but
the
uncultivated
talent
and
humble
station
of
the
author
a
reader
does
not
exclaim
what
a
delicate
sentiment
what
a
beautiful
simile
what
easy
and
musical
versification
but
cries
in
rapture
heavens
what
a
prodigy
a
poet
from
the
scullery
a
muse
in
livery
or
apollo
with
a
trowel
the
public
is
astonished
into
liberality
the
scullion
eats
from
those
trenchers
he
scoured
before
the
footman
is
admitted
into
the
coach
behind
which
he
was
wont
to
stand
and
the
bricklayer
instead
of
plastering
walls
bedaubs
his
illustrious
partner
with
the
mortar
of
his
praise
thus
lifted
into
a
higher
sphere
their
talents
receive
cultivation
they
become
professed
bards
and
though
their
subsequent
works
bear
evident
marks
of
improvement
they
are
neglected
among
the
rest
of
their
brethren
because
that
novelty
which
recommended
them
in
the
beginning
no
longer
remains
so
it
fared
with
our
adventurer
in
his
new
occupation
there
was
something
so
extraordinary
in
a
nobleman
understanding
medicine
and
so
uncommon
in
a
physician
prescribing
gratis
that
the
curiosity
and
admiration
of
the
company
at
bristol
were
engaged
and
they
followed
his
advice
as
the
direction
of
some
supernatural
intelligence
but
now
that
he
professed
himself
one
of
the
faculty
and
might
be
supposed
to
have
refreshed
his
memory
and
reinforced
his
knowledge
for
the
occasion
he
was
as
much
overlooked
as
any
other
physician
unsupported
by
interest
or
cabal
or
at
least
the
notice
he
attracted
was
not
at
all
to
the
advantage
of
his
character
because
it
wholly
regarded
the
decline
of
his
fortune
which
is
a
fund
of
disgrace
these
mortifications
did
not
overcome
the
patience
and
perseverance
of
fathom
who
foresaw
that
the
soothing
hand
of
time
would
cast
a
veil
of
oblivion
over
those
scenes
which
were
remembered
to
his
prejudice
and
that
in
the
meantime
though
he
was
excluded
from
the
private
parties
of
the
fair
sex
in
which
his
main
hope
of
success
was
placed
he
should
be
able
to
insinuate
himself
into
some
degree
of
favour
and
practice
among
the
male
patients
and
some
lucky
cure
properly
displayed
might
be
the
means
of
propagating
his
fame
and
banishing
that
reserve
which
at
present
interfered
with
his
purpose
accordingly
it
was
not
long
before
he
found
means
to
break
that
spell
of
universal
prejudice
that
hedged
him
in
at
the
ordinary
which
he
frequented
his
polite
carriage
facetious
remarks
and
agreeable
stories
soon
conciliated
the
regard
of
his
among
whom
he
sometimes
rallied
his
own
transformation
with
singular
and
success
he
was
even
witty
upon
his
want
of
employment
and
used
to
observe
that
a
physician
without
practice
had
one
comfort
to
which
his
brethren
were
strangers
namely
that
the
seldomer
he
had
occasion
to
prescribe
the
less
he
had
upon
his
conscience
on
account
of
being
accessory
to
the
death
of
his
nothing
so
effectually
blunts
the
shafts
of
ridicule
and
defeats
the
aims
of
slander
as
this
method
of
anticipation
in
spite
of
the
arrows
that
were
levelled
against
his
reputation
from
every
at
tunbridge
he
made
his
party
good
among
almost
all
the
gay
young
gentlemen
that
frequented
the
place
far
from
avoiding
his
company
they
began
to
court
his
conversation
and
he
was
commonly
seen
in
the
walks
surrounded
with
a
group
of
admirers
having
thus
paved
the
way
for
a
total
removal
of
the
invidious
prepossession
that
obstructed
his
views
he
one
night
while
every
person
was
lulled
in
the
arms
of
repose
and
universal
silence
prevailed
tuned
his
violin
and
began
to
play
some
masterly
airs
in
a
tone
so
uncommonly
expressive
and
with
such
ravishing
dexterity
of
execution
that
a
certain
lady
who
lodged
in
the
same
house
being
waked
by
the
music
and
ignorant
of
the
source
from
which
it
flowed
listened
with
rapture
as
to
the
harp
of
an
angel
and
wrapping
herself
in
a
loose
gown
rose
and
opened
her
chamber
door
in
order
to
discover
in
what
apartment
the
musician
resided
she
no
sooner
entered
the
passage
than
she
found
her
already
assembled
on
the
same
occasion
and
there
they
remained
during
the
best
part
of
the
night
transported
by
the
harmony
which
our
hero
produced
doctor
fathom
was
immediately
known
to
be
the
author
of
this
entertainment
and
thus
retrieved
the
benefit
of
that
admiration
which
he
had
forfeited
by
appearing
in
the
shape
of
a
physician
for
as
people
had
formerly
wondered
to
see
a
count
skilled
in
medicine
they
were
now
amazed
to
find
a
physician
such
a
master
in
music
the
good
effects
of
this
stratagem
were
almost
instantaneous
his
performance
became
the
topic
of
discourse
among
all
the
fashionable
company
his
male
friends
complimented
him
from
the
information
of
the
other
sex
and
that
lady
whom
he
had
regaled
instead
of
that
shyness
and
disdain
with
which
she
used
to
receive
his
salutation
at
their
very
next
meeting
in
the
thoroughfare
returned
his
bow
with
marks
of
profound
respect
nay
at
midnight
she
with
the
rest
took
post
in
the
same
place
where
they
had
been
stationed
before
and
by
frequent
tittering
and
repeated
whispers
gave
intimation
to
fathom
that
they
would
be
glad
of
a
second
serenade
but
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
human
passions
to
indulge
this
their
desire
it
was
his
interest
to
inflame
their
impatience
rather
than
to
gratify
their
expectation
and
therefore
he
tantalised
them
for
some
hours
by
tuning
his
violin
and
playing
some
flourishes
which
however
produced
nothing
to
fulfil
their
wishes
at
the
ordinary
he
was
accosted
by
a
gentleman
a
lodger
in
the
same
house
who
assured
him
that
the
ladies
would
take
it
as
a
great
favour
if
he
would
let
them
know
when
he
intended
to
amuse
himself
again
with
his
instrument
that
they
might
not
by
falling
asleep
beforehand
deprive
themselves
of
the
pleasure
of
hearing
his
music
to
this
message
he
replied
with
an
air
of
consequence
and
reserve
that
though
music
was
not
the
art
he
professed
he
should
be
always
complaisant
enough
to
entertain
the
ladies
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
when
their
commands
were
signified
to
him
in
a
manner
suited
to
his
character
but
that
he
would
never
put
himself
on
the
footing
of
an
itinerate
harper
whose
music
is
tolerated
through
the
medium
of
a
board
partition
the
gentleman
having
reported
this
answer
to
his
constituents
they
empowered
him
to
invite
doctor
fathom
to
breakfast
and
he
was
next
morning
introduced
with
the
usual
ceremony
and
treated
with
uncommon
regard
by
all
the
females
of
the
house
assembled
for
his
reception
having
thus
broken
the
ice
of
their
aversion
in
one
part
so
as
that
the
beams
of
his
personal
accomplishments
had
room
to
operate
he
soon
effected
a
general
thaw
in
his
favour
and
found
himself
growing
once
more
into
request
amongst
the
most
amiable
part
of
the
creation
his
company
was
coveted
and
his
taste
consulted
in
their
balls
concerts
and
private
assemblies
and
he
recompensed
the
regard
they
paid
to
him
with
an
incessant
exertion
of
his
agreeable
talents
politeness
and
chapter
triumphs
over
a
medical
rival
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
this
attention
his
medical
capacity
seemed
to
be
quite
forgot
they
respected
his
good
breeding
were
charmed
with
his
voice
and
admired
the
fine
touches
of
his
hand
upon
the
violin
but
in
cultivating
the
fiddler
they
utterly
neglected
the
physician
and
in
vain
did
he
attempt
to
divide
their
regard
by
taking
all
opportunities
to
turn
the
conversation
into
a
more
interesting
channel
it
was
to
little
purpose
he
endeavoured
to
arouse
the
wonder
of
his
audience
with
frequent
descriptions
of
portentous
maladies
and
amazing
cures
he
had
seen
and
performed
in
the
course
of
his
study
and
practice
abroad
and
to
no
effect
did
he
publicly
busy
himself
in
making
experiments
on
the
mineral
water
in
which
he
pretended
to
have
made
several
new
and
important
discoveries
these
efforts
did
not
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
the
minds
of
the
company
because
they
saw
nothing
surprising
in
a
physician
being
acquainted
with
all
the
mysteries
of
his
art
and
as
their
custom
was
already
bespoke
for
others
of
the
profession
whom
it
was
their
interest
to
employ
our
adventurer
might
have
starved
amidst
the
caresses
of
his
acquaintance
had
not
he
derived
considerable
advantage
from
a
lucky
accident
in
the
course
of
his
expectancy
a
gentlewoman
daughter
of
a
weakly
constitution
by
drinking
the
waters
had
so
far
recovered
her
health
and
complexion
as
to
allure
the
affection
of
a
young
squire
in
the
neighbourhood
who
amused
her
for
some
time
with
his
addresses
until
his
heart
was
seduced
by
the
charms
of
another
young
lady
lately
arrived
at
the
wells
the
forsaken
nymph
shocked
at
this
disgrace
and
mortification
relapsed
into
her
former
languishing
disorder
and
was
by
her
mother
put
under
the
management
and
prescription
of
a
physician
who
had
been
an
industrious
enemy
of
fathom
from
his
first
appearance
at
tunbridge
the
patient
though
violently
chagrined
at
the
levity
of
her
quondam
admirer
was
not
altogether
without
hope
that
the
very
same
inconstancy
which
had
prompted
him
to
leave
her
might
in
time
induce
him
to
return
after
the
novelty
of
his
new
passion
should
be
wore
off
and
this
hope
served
to
support
her
under
the
sorrow
and
disgrace
of
her
disappointment
at
length
however
the
squire
and
his
new
mistress
disappeared
and
some
busybody
was
officious
enough
to
communicate
this
piece
of
news
to
the
forlorn
shepherdess
with
this
additional
circumstance
that
they
were
gone
to
a
neighbouring
parish
to
be
joined
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
these
fatal
tidings
were
no
sooner
imparted
to
the
abandoned
phillis
than
she
was
seized
with
an
hysteric
fit
and
what
rendered
the
accident
more
unfortunate
her
physician
had
been
called
to
the
country
and
was
not
expected
at
tunbridge
till
next
day
the
apothecary
was
immediately
summoned
and
being
either
puzzled
by
the
symptoms
or
afraid
of
encroaching
upon
the
province
of
his
superiors
advised
the
old
lady
to
send
for
doctor
fathom
without
delay
she
had
no
other
objection
to
this
expedient
but
the
enmity
which
she
knew
subsisted
between
the
two
leeches
yet
hearing
that
her
own
doctor
would
not
consult
with
fathom
upon
his
return
but
perhaps
renounce
the
patient
by
which
means
her
daughter
health
might
be
endangered
she
would
not
solicit
our
assistance
until
the
young
lady
had
remained
seven
hours
speechless
and
insensible
when
her
fear
prevailing
over
every
other
consideration
she
implored
the
advice
of
our
adventurer
who
having
made
the
necessary
interrogations
and
felt
the
patient
pulse
which
was
regular
and
distinct
found
reason
to
conclude
that
the
fit
would
not
last
much
longer
and
after
having
observed
that
she
was
in
a
very
dangerous
way
prescribed
some
medicines
for
external
application
and
to
enhance
their
opinion
of
his
diligence
and
humanity
resolved
to
stay
in
the
room
and
observe
their
effect
his
judgment
did
not
fail
him
on
this
occasion
in
less
than
half
an
hour
after
his
embrocations
had
been
applied
she
recovered
the
use
of
her
tongue
opened
her
eyes
and
having
in
delirious
exclamations
upbraided
her
perfidious
lover
became
quite
sensible
and
composed
though
she
continued
extremely
low
and
dejected
to
remedy
these
sinkings
certain
cordials
were
immediately
administered
according
to
the
prescription
of
doctor
fathom
upon
whom
extraordinary
encomiums
were
bestowed
by
all
present
who
believed
he
had
actually
rescued
her
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
as
he
was
by
this
time
let
into
the
secrets
of
the
family
he
found
himself
in
a
fair
way
of
being
an
egregious
favourite
of
the
old
gentlewoman
when
unluckily
his
brother
having
dismissed
his
country
patient
with
uncommon
despatch
entered
the
apartment
and
eyed
his
rival
with
looks
of
inexpressible
rage
then
surveying
the
patient
and
the
phials
that
stood
upon
the
table
by
turns
what
in
the
name
of
god
cried
he
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
trash
really
doctor
replied
the
mother
a
little
confounded
at
being
thus
taken
by
surprise
biddy
has
been
taken
dangerously
ill
and
lain
seven
or
eight
hours
in
a
severe
fit
from
which
i
am
confident
she
would
never
have
recovered
without
the
help
of
a
physician
and
as
you
were
absent
we
had
recourse
to
this
gentleman
whose
prescription
hath
had
a
happy
and
surprising
effect
effect
cried
this
offended
member
of
the
faculty
pshaw
stuff
who
made
you
judge
of
effects
or
causes
then
advancing
to
the
patient
what
has
been
the
matter
miss
biddy
that
you
could
not
wait
till
my
return
here
fathom
interposing
sir
said
he
if
you
will
step
into
the
next
room
i
will
communicate
my
sentiments
of
the
case
together
with
the
method
upon
which
i
have
proceeded
that
we
may
deliberate
upon
the
next
step
that
is
to
be
taken
instead
of
complying
with
this
proposal
he
seated
himself
in
a
chair
with
his
back
to
our
adventurer
and
while
he
examined
miss
biddy
pulse
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
should
not
consult
with
him
about
the
matter
fathom
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
at
this
uncivil
answer
walked
round
his
antagonist
and
placing
himself
in
his
front
desired
to
know
his
reason
for
treating
him
with
such
supercilious
contempt
i
am
resolved
said
the
other
never
to
consult
with
any
physician
who
has
not
taken
his
degrees
at
either
of
the
english
universities
upon
the
supposition
replied
our
adventurer
that
no
person
can
be
properly
educated
for
the
profession
at
any
other
school
you
are
in
the
right
answered
doctor
looby
that
is
one
of
many
reasons
i
have
to
decline
the
consultation
how
far
you
are
in
the
right
retorted
fathom
i
leave
the
world
to
judge
after
i
have
observed
that
in
your
english
universities
there
is
no
opportunity
of
studying
the
art
no
not
so
much
as
a
lecture
given
on
the
subject
nor
is
there
one
physician
of
note
in
this
kingdom
who
has
not
derived
the
greatest
part
of
his
medical
knowledge
from
the
instructions
of
foreigners
looby
incensed
at
this
asseveration
which
he
was
not
prepared
to
refute
exclaimed
in
a
most
infuriate
accent
who
are
you
whence
came
you
where
was
you
bred
you
are
one
of
those
i
believe
who
graduate
themselves
and
commence
doctors
the
lord
knows
how
an
interloper
who
without
licence
or
authority
comes
hither
to
take
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
gentlemen
who
have
been
trained
to
the
business
in
a
regular
manner
and
bestowed
great
pains
and
expense
to
qualify
themselves
for
the
profession
for
my
own
part
my
education
cost
me
fifteen
hundred
pounds
never
was
money
laid
out
to
less
purpose
said
ferdinand
for
it
does
not
appear
that
you
have
learned
so
much
as
the
basis
of
medical
requirements
namely
that
decorum
and
urbanity
which
ought
to
distinguish
the
deportment
of
every
physician
you
have
even
debased
the
noblest
and
most
beneficial
art
that
ever
engaged
the
study
of
mankind
which
can
not
be
too
much
cultivated
and
too
little
restrained
in
seeking
to
limit
the
practice
of
it
to
a
set
of
illiberal
wretches
who
like
the
lowest
handicraftsmen
claim
the
exclusive
privileges
of
a
corporation
had
you
doubted
my
ability
you
ought
to
have
satisfied
yourself
in
a
manner
consistent
with
decency
and
candour
but
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
is
such
a
malicious
outrage
upon
good
manners
and
humanity
that
were
it
not
for
my
regard
to
these
ladies
i
would
chastise
you
for
your
insolence
on
the
spot
meanwhile
madam
addressing
himself
to
the
mother
you
must
give
me
leave
to
insist
upon
your
dismissing
either
that
gentleman
or
me
without
hesitation
this
peremptory
language
had
an
instantaneous
effect
upon
the
hearers
looby
face
grew
pale
and
his
nether
lip
began
to
tremble
the
patient
was
dismayed
and
the
old
gentlewoman
concerned
and
perplexed
she
earnestly
besought
the
gentlemen
to
be
reconciled
to
each
other
and
enter
into
a
friendly
consultation
upon
her
daughter
distemper
but
finding
both
equally
averse
to
accommodation
and
fathom
becoming
more
and
more
importunate
in
his
demand
she
presented
him
with
a
double
fee
and
giving
him
to
understand
that
doctor
looby
had
long
attended
the
family
and
was
intimately
acquainted
with
her
own
and
constitution
said
she
hoped
he
would
not
take
it
amiss
if
she
retained
her
old
physician
though
our
hero
was
much
mortified
at
this
triumph
of
his
rival
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
retired
with
great
complaisance
wishing
that
miss
biddy
might
never
again
be
the
subject
of
such
a
disagreeable
dispute
whether
the
patient
was
frighted
at
this
altercation
or
displeased
with
her
mother
decision
against
an
agreeable
young
fellow
who
had
as
it
were
recalled
her
from
the
grave
and
made
himself
master
of
the
secret
that
rankled
at
her
heart
or
the
disease
had
wound
up
her
nerves
for
another
paroxysm
certain
it
is
she
all
of
a
sudden
broke
forth
into
a
violent
peal
of
laughter
which
was
succeeded
by
the
most
doleful
cries
and
other
expressions
of
grief
then
she
relapsed
into
a
fit
attended
with
strong
convulsions
to
the
unspeakable
terror
of
the
old
gentlewoman
who
entreated
doctor
looby
to
be
expeditious
in
his
prescription
accordingly
he
seized
the
pen
with
great
confidence
and
a
whole
magazine
of
antihysteric
medicines
were
in
different
forms
externally
and
internally
applied
nevertheless
either
nature
was
disturbed
in
her
own
efforts
by
these
applications
or
the
patient
was
resolved
to
disgrace
the
doctor
for
the
more
remedies
that
were
administered
her
convulsions
became
the
more
violent
and
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavours
he
could
not
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
distemper
such
a
miscarriage
upon
the
back
of
his
rival
success
could
not
fail
to
overwhelm
him
with
confusion
especially
as
the
mother
baited
him
with
repeated
entreaties
to
do
something
for
the
recovery
of
her
daughter
at
length
after
having
exercised
her
patience
in
vain
for
several
hours
this
affectionate
parent
could
no
longer
suppress
the
suggestions
of
her
concern
but
in
an
incoherent
strain
told
him
that
her
duty
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
longer
silent
in
an
affair
on
which
depended
the
life
of
her
dear
child
that
she
had
seen
enough
to
believe
he
had
mistaken
the
case
of
poor
biddy
and
he
could
not
justly
blame
her
for
recalling
doctor
fathom
whose
prescription
had
operated
in
a
miraculous
manner
looby
shocked
at
this
proposal
protested
against
it
with
great
vehemence
as
an
expedient
highly
injurious
to
himself
my
remedies
said
he
are
just
beginning
to
take
effect
and
in
all
probability
the
fit
will
not
last
much
longer
so
that
by
calling
in
another
person
at
this
juncture
you
will
defraud
me
of
that
credit
which
is
my
due
and
deck
my
adversary
with
trophies
to
which
he
has
no
pretension
she
was
prevailed
upon
by
this
remonstrance
to
wait
another
half
hour
when
perceiving
as
yet
no
alteration
for
the
better
and
being
distracted
with
her
fears
which
reproached
her
with
want
of
natural
affection
she
sent
a
message
to
doctor
fathom
desiring
to
see
him
with
all
possible
despatch
he
was
not
slow
in
obeying
the
call
but
hastening
to
the
scene
of
action
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
looby
still
in
the
apartment
this
gentleman
since
better
might
not
be
resolved
to
sacrifice
his
pride
to
his
interest
and
rather
than
lose
his
patient
altogether
and
run
the
risk
of
forfeiting
his
reputation
at
the
same
time
stayed
with
intention
to
compromise
his
difference
with
fathom
that
he
might
not
be
wholly
excluded
from
the
honour
of
the
cure
in
case
it
could
be
effected
but
he
had
reckoned
without
his
host
in
his
calculation
of
the
count
placability
for
when
he
put
on
his
capitulating
face
and
after
a
slight
apology
for
his
late
behaviour
proposed
that
all
animosity
should
subside
in
favour
of
the
young
lady
whose
life
was
at
stake
our
hero
rejected
his
advances
with
infinite
disdain
and
assured
the
mother
in
a
very
solemn
tone
that
far
from
consulting
with
a
man
who
had
treated
him
so
unworthily
he
would
not
stay
another
minute
in
the
house
unless
he
should
see
him
discarded
a
satisfaction
barely
sufficient
to
atone
for
the
affront
he
himself
had
suffered
by
the
unjust
preference
she
had
before
given
to
his
rival
there
was
no
remedy
looby
was
obliged
to
retreat
in
his
turn
then
our
adventurer
approaching
the
bedside
reconnoitred
the
patient
examined
the
medicines
which
had
been
administered
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
in
expressive
silence
detached
the
footman
with
a
new
order
to
the
apothecary
it
was
well
the
messenger
used
expedition
otherwise
doctor
fathom
would
have
been
anticipated
by
the
operation
of
nature
for
the
fit
having
almost
run
its
career
miss
biddy
was
on
the
point
of
retrieving
her
senses
when
the
frontal
prescribed
by
fathom
was
applied
to
the
efficacy
of
this
therefore
was
ascribed
her
recovery
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
began
to
pour
forth
unconnected
ejaculations
and
in
a
few
moments
after
she
was
persuaded
to
swallow
a
draught
prepared
for
the
purpose
her
perception
returned
and
ferdinand
gained
the
reputation
of
having
performed
a
second
miracle
but
he
was
furnished
with
a
piece
of
intelligence
of
much
more
energy
than
all
she
had
taken
and
so
soon
as
he
concluded
she
was
capable
to
bear
the
news
without
any
dangerous
emotion
he
among
other
articles
of
culled
for
her
amusement
took
the
opportunity
of
telling
the
company
that
squire
stub
the
cause
of
miss
biddy
disorder
had
in
his
way
to
matrimony
been
robbed
of
his
bride
by
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
had
been
formerly
engaged
he
had
waited
for
her
on
purpose
at
an
inn
on
the
road
where
he
found
means
to
appease
her
displeasure
which
he
had
it
seems
incurred
and
to
supersede
her
new
lover
whom
she
quitted
without
ceremony
upon
which
the
squire
had
returned
to
tunbridge
cursing
her
levity
yet
blessing
his
good
stars
for
having
so
seasonably
prevented
his
ruin
which
would
have
infallibly
been
the
consequence
of
his
marrying
such
an
adventurer
it
would
be
superfluous
to
observe
that
these
tidings
operated
like
an
admirable
specific
on
the
spirits
of
the
young
lady
who
while
she
affected
to
pity
the
squire
was
so
much
overjoyed
at
his
disappointment
that
her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
uncommon
vivacity
and
in
less
than
two
hours
after
the
last
of
those
terrible
attacks
she
was
restored
to
a
better
state
of
health
than
she
had
enjoyed
for
many
weeks
fathom
was
not
forgot
amidst
the
rejoicings
of
the
family
besides
an
handsome
gratuity
for
the
effects
of
his
extraordinary
skill
the
old
lady
favoured
him
with
a
general
invitation
to
her
house
and
the
daughter
not
only
considered
him
as
the
restorer
of
her
health
and
angel
of
her
good
fortune
but
also
began
to
discover
an
uncommon
relish
for
his
conversation
so
that
he
was
struck
with
the
prospect
of
succeeding
squire
stub
in
her
affection
a
conquest
which
if
sanctioned
by
the
approbation
of
the
mother
would
console
him
for
all
the
disappointments
he
had
sustained
for
miss
biddy
was
entitled
to
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pounds
provided
she
should
marry
with
the
consent
of
her
parent
who
was
the
sole
executrix
of
the
father
will
animated
with
the
hope
of
such
an
advantageous
match
our
adventurer
missed
no
opportunity
of
improving
the
lodgment
he
had
made
while
the
two
ladies
failed
not
to
extol
his
medical
capacity
among
all
their
female
acquaintances
by
means
of
this
circulation
his
advice
was
demanded
in
several
other
cases
which
he
managed
with
such
an
imposing
air
of
sagacity
and
importance
that
his
fame
began
to
spread
and
before
the
end
of
the
season
he
had
ravished
more
than
one
half
of
the
business
from
his
competitor
notwithstanding
these
fortunate
events
he
foresaw
that
he
should
find
great
difficulty
in
transplanting
his
reputation
so
as
to
take
root
in
london
which
was
the
only
soil
in
which
he
could
propose
to
rise
to
any
degree
of
prosperity
and
independence
and
this
reflection
was
grounded
upon
a
maxim
which
universally
prevails
among
the
english
people
namely
to
overlook
and
wholly
neglect
on
their
return
to
the
metropolis
all
the
connexions
they
may
have
chanced
to
acquire
during
their
residence
at
any
of
the
medical
wells
and
this
social
disposition
is
so
scrupulously
maintained
that
two
persons
who
lived
in
the
most
intimate
correspondence
at
bath
or
tunbridge
shall
in
hours
so
totally
forget
their
friendship
as
to
meet
in
james
park
without
betraying
the
least
token
of
recognition
so
that
one
would
imagine
these
mineral
waters
were
so
many
streams
issuing
from
the
river
lethe
so
famed
of
old
for
washing
away
all
traces
of
memory
and
recollection
aware
of
this
oblivious
principle
doctor
fathom
collected
all
his
qualifications
in
order
to
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
miss
biddy
as
would
resist
all
her
endeavours
to
shake
him
from
her
remembrance
and
his
efforts
succeeded
so
well
that
squire
advances
to
a
reconciliation
were
treated
with
manifest
indifference
in
all
probability
our
hero
would
have
made
a
very
advantageous
campaign
had
not
his
good
fortune
been
retarded
by
an
obstruction
which
as
he
did
not
perceive
it
he
could
not
possibly
surmount
in
displaying
his
accomplishments
to
captivate
the
daughter
he
had
unwittingly
made
an
absolute
conquest
of
the
mother
who
superintended
the
conduct
of
miss
biddy
with
such
jealous
vigilance
that
he
could
find
no
opportunity
of
profiting
by
the
progress
he
had
made
in
her
heart
for
the
careful
matron
would
never
lose
sight
of
her
no
not
for
one
moment
had
the
old
lady
given
the
least
intimation
to
our
adventurer
of
the
sentiments
she
entertained
in
his
behalf
his
complaisance
was
of
such
a
pliable
texture
that
he
would
have
quitted
his
other
pursuit
and
made
her
the
sole
object
of
his
attention
but
she
either
depended
upon
the
effect
of
his
own
good
taste
and
discernment
or
was
too
proud
to
disclose
a
passion
which
he
had
hitherto
overlooked
chapter
repairs
to
the
metropolis
and
enrols
himself
among
the
sons
of
paean
before
this
affair
could
be
brought
to
a
proper
explanation
the
season
being
almost
ended
the
ladies
departed
from
tunbridge
and
in
a
little
time
doctor
fathom
followed
them
to
london
having
previously
obtained
permission
to
visit
them
in
that
metropolis
he
had
solicited
the
same
favour
of
some
other
families
in
which
he
hoped
to
take
root
though
he
knew
they
were
to
different
physicians
and
resolving
to
make
his
first
medical
appearance
in
london
with
some
eclat
he
not
only
purchased
an
old
chariot
which
was
new
painted
for
the
purpose
but
likewise
hired
a
footman
whom
he
clothed
in
laced
livery
in
order
to
distinguish
himself
from
the
common
run
of
his
brethren
this
equipage
though
much
more
expensive
than
his
finances
could
bear
he
found
absolutely
necessary
to
give
him
a
chance
for
employment
as
every
shabby
retainer
to
physic
in
this
capital
had
provided
himself
with
a
vehicle
which
was
altogether
used
by
way
of
a
travelling
to
draw
in
customers
so
that
a
walking
physician
was
considered
as
an
obscure
pedlar
trudging
from
street
to
street
with
his
pack
of
knowledge
on
his
shoulders
and
selling
his
remnants
of
advice
by
retail
a
chariot
was
not
now
set
up
for
the
convenience
of
a
man
sinking
under
the
fatigue
of
extensive
practice
but
as
a
piece
of
furniture
every
way
as
necessary
as
a
large
periwig
with
three
tails
and
a
physician
let
his
merit
in
other
respects
be
never
so
conspicuous
can
no
more
expect
to
become
considerable
in
business
without
the
assistance
of
this
implement
than
he
can
hope
to
live
without
food
or
breathe
without
a
windpipe
this
requisite
is
so
well
understood
that
exclusive
of
those
who
profess
themselves
doctors
every
raw
surgeon
every
idle
apothecary
who
can
make
interest
with
some
foolhardy
coachmaker
may
be
seen
dancing
the
bays
in
all
places
of
public
resort
and
grinning
to
one
another
from
their
respective
carriages
hence
proceed
many
of
those
cruel
accidents
which
are
recorded
in
the
daily
papers
an
apothecary
horses
take
fright
and
run
away
with
his
chariot
which
is
heard
of
no
more
an
eminent
surgeon
being
overturned
is
so
terrified
at
the
thoughts
of
mutilation
that
he
resolves
to
walk
on
foot
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
the
coachman
of
a
physician
of
great
practice
having
the
misfortune
to
be
disabled
by
a
fall
from
the
box
his
master
can
never
find
another
to
supply
his
place
none
of
these
observations
escaped
the
penetrating
eye
of
fathom
who
before
he
pretended
to
seat
himself
in
this
machine
had
made
proper
inquiry
into
all
the
other
methods
practised
with
a
view
to
keep
the
wheels
in
motion
in
his
researches
he
found
that
the
great
world
was
wholly
engrossed
by
a
few
practitioners
who
had
arrived
at
the
summit
of
reputation
consequently
were
no
longer
obliged
to
cultivate
those
arts
by
which
they
rose
and
that
the
rest
of
the
business
was
parcelled
out
into
small
enclosures
occupied
by
different
groups
of
personages
male
and
female
who
stood
in
rings
and
tossed
the
ball
from
one
to
another
there
being
in
each
department
two
sets
the
individuals
of
which
relieved
one
another
occasionally
every
knot
was
composed
of
a
nurse
apothecary
surgeon
and
physician
and
sometimes
a
midwife
was
admitted
into
the
party
and
in
this
manner
the
farce
was
commonly
performed
a
fine
lady
fatigued
with
idleness
complains
of
the
vapours
is
deprived
of
her
rest
though
not
so
sick
as
to
have
recourse
to
medicine
her
favourite
maid
tired
with
giving
her
attendance
in
the
night
thinks
proper
for
the
benefit
of
her
own
repose
to
complain
of
a
violent
headache
and
recommends
to
her
mistress
a
nurse
of
approved
tenderness
and
discretion
at
whose
house
in
all
likelihood
the
said
chambermaid
hath
oft
given
the
rendezvous
to
a
male
friend
the
nurse
well
skilled
in
the
mysteries
of
her
occupation
persuades
the
patient
that
her
malady
far
from
being
slight
or
chimerical
may
proceed
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
of
the
hysterical
affection
unless
it
be
nipt
in
the
bud
by
some
very
effectual
remedy
then
she
recounts
a
surprising
cure
performed
by
a
certain
apothecary
and
appeals
to
the
testimony
of
the
who
being
the
gossip
of
his
wife
confirms
the
evidence
and
corroborates
the
proposal
the
apothecary
being
summoned
finds
her
ladyship
in
such
a
delicate
situation
that
he
declines
prescribing
and
advises
her
to
send
for
a
physician
without
delay
the
nomination
of
course
falls
to
him
and
the
doctor
being
called
declares
the
necessity
of
immediate
venesection
which
is
accordingly
performed
by
a
surgeon
of
the
association
this
is
one
way
of
beginning
the
game
though
the
commencement
often
varies
and
sometimes
the
apothecary
and
sometimes
the
physician
opens
the
scene
but
be
that
as
it
will
they
always
appear
in
a
string
like
a
flight
of
wild
geese
and
each
confederacy
maintains
a
correspondence
with
one
particular
undertaker
fathom
upon
these
considerations
set
up
his
rest
in
the
first
floor
of
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
of
charing
cross
to
whom
he
was
introduced
by
a
letter
from
a
friend
at
tunbridge
and
who
being
made
acquainted
with
his
ability
and
scheme
promised
to
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
serving
him
and
indeed
seemed
to
espouse
his
interest
with
great
alacrity
he
introduced
him
to
some
of
his
patients
on
the
strength
of
a
gratis
visit
sounded
forth
his
praise
among
all
the
good
women
of
his
acquaintance
and
even
prevailed
upon
him
to
publish
advertisements
importing
that
he
would
every
day
at
a
certain
time
and
place
give
his
advice
to
the
poor
for
nothing
hoping
that
by
means
of
some
lucky
cure
his
fame
might
be
extended
and
his
practice
grow
into
request
in
the
meantime
his
chariot
rolled
along
through
all
the
most
frequented
streets
during
the
whole
forenoon
and
at
the
usual
hour
he
never
failed
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
medical
with
all
that
solemnity
of
feature
and
address
by
which
the
modern
sons
of
paean
are
distinguished
not
but
that
he
was
often
puzzled
about
the
decision
of
his
diurnal
route
for
the
method
of
driving
up
one
street
and
down
another
without
halting
was
become
such
a
stale
expedient
that
the
very
used
to
stand
at
the
shop
doors
and
ridicule
the
vain
parade
at
length
however
he
perused
the
map
of
london
with
great
diligence
and
having
acquired
a
distinct
idea
of
its
topography
used
to
alight
at
the
end
of
long
narrow
thoroughfares
and
paved
courts
where
the
chariot
was
ordered
to
wait
till
his
return
and
walking
with
great
gravity
through
the
different
turnings
of
these
alleys
regain
his
carriage
by
another
passage
and
resume
his
seat
with
an
air
of
vast
importance
with
a
view
to
protract
the
time
of
his
supposed
visits
he
would
at
one
place
turn
aside
to
a
wall
at
another
cheapen
an
urinal
at
a
third
corner
read
a
quack
advertisement
or
lounge
a
few
minutes
in
some
bookseller
shop
and
lastly
glide
into
some
obscure
and
treat
himself
with
a
dram
of
usquebaugh
the
other
means
used
to
force
a
trade
such
as
ordering
himself
to
be
called
from
church
alarming
the
neighbourhood
with
knocking
at
his
door
in
the
night
receiving
sudden
messages
in
places
of
resort
and
inserting
his
cures
by
way
of
news
in
the
daily
papers
had
been
so
injudiciously
hackneyed
by
every
desperate
sculler
in
physic
that
they
had
lost
their
effect
upon
the
public
and
therefore
were
excluded
from
the
plan
of
our
adventurer
whose
scheme
for
the
present
was
to
exert
himself
in
winning
the
favour
of
those
sage
sibyls
who
keep
as
it
were
the
temple
of
medicine
and
admit
the
young
priest
to
the
service
of
the
altar
but
this
he
considered
as
a
temporary
project
only
until
he
should
have
acquired
interest
enough
to
erect
an
hospital
lock
or
infirmary
by
the
voluntary
subscription
of
his
friends
a
scheme
which
had
succeeded
to
a
miracle
with
many
of
the
profession
who
had
raised
themselves
into
notice
upon
the
carcases
of
the
poor
yet
even
this
branch
was
already
overstocked
insomuch
that
almost
every
street
was
furnished
with
one
of
these
charitable
receptacles
which
instead
of
diminishing
the
taxes
for
the
maintenance
of
the
poor
encouraged
the
vulgar
to
be
idle
and
dissolute
by
opening
an
asylum
to
them
and
their
families
from
the
diseases
of
poverty
and
intemperance
for
it
remains
to
be
proved
that
the
parish
rates
are
decreased
the
bills
of
mortality
lessened
the
people
more
numerous
or
the
streets
less
infested
with
beggars
notwithstanding
the
immense
sums
yearly
granted
by
individuals
for
the
relief
of
the
indigent
but
waiving
these
reflections
doctor
fathom
hoped
that
his
landlord
would
be
a
most
useful
implement
for
extending
his
influence
and
for
that
reason
admitted
him
into
a
degree
of
partnership
after
being
fully
convinced
that
he
was
not
under
articles
to
any
other
physician
nevertheless
he
was
very
much
mistaken
in
reckoning
on
the
importance
of
his
new
ally
who
was
like
himself
a
needy
adventurer
settled
upon
credit
and
altogether
unemployed
except
among
the
very
refuse
of
the
people
whom
no
other
person
would
take
the
trouble
to
attend
so
that
our
hero
got
little
else
than
experience
and
trouble
excepting
a
few
guineas
which
he
made
shift
to
glean
among
sojourners
with
whom
he
became
occasionally
acquainted
or
young
people
who
had
been
unfortunate
in
their
amours
in
the
midst
of
these
endeavours
he
did
not
omit
his
duty
to
the
old
gentlewoman
whose
daughter
he
had
cured
at
tunbridge
and
was
always
received
with
particular
complacency
which
perhaps
he
in
some
measure
owed
to
his
genteel
equipage
that
gave
credit
to
every
door
before
which
it
was
seen
yet
miss
biddy
was
as
inaccessible
as
ever
while
the
mother
became
more
and
more
warm
in
her
civilities
till
at
length
after
having
prepared
him
with
some
extraordinary
compliments
she
gave
him
to
understand
that
biddy
was
no
better
than
a
girl
far
from
being
unexceptionable
in
her
moral
character
and
particularly
deficient
in
duty
and
gratitude
to
her
who
had
been
always
a
tender
and
indulgent
parent
she
was
therefore
determined
to
punish
the
young
minx
for
her
levity
and
want
of
natural
affection
by
altering
her
own
condition
could
she
find
a
worthy
and
agreeable
man
on
whom
she
could
bestow
her
hand
and
fortune
without
a
blush
the
film
was
instantly
removed
from
fathom
eyes
by
this
declaration
which
she
uttered
with
such
a
significancy
of
look
as
thrilled
to
his
soul
with
joyful
presage
while
he
replied
it
would
indeed
be
a
difficult
task
to
find
a
man
who
merited
such
happiness
and
honour
but
surely
some
there
were
who
would
task
their
faculties
to
the
uttermost
in
manifesting
their
gratitude
and
desire
of
rendering
themselves
worthy
of
such
distinction
though
this
answer
was
pronounced
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
her
to
understand
he
had
taken
the
hint
she
would
not
cheapen
her
condescension
so
much
as
to
explain
herself
further
at
that
juncture
and
he
was
very
well
contented
to
woo
her
on
her
own
terms
accordingly
he
began
to
season
his
behaviour
with
a
spice
of
gallantry
when
he
had
opportunities
of
being
particular
with
this
new
inamorata
and
in
proportion
to
the
returns
she
made
he
gradually
detached
himself
from
miss
biddy
by
intermitting
and
at
last
discontinuing
those
ardent
expressions
of
love
and
admiration
which
he
had
made
shift
to
convey
in
private
looks
and
stolen
whispers
during
the
rancorous
inspection
of
her
mother
such
alteration
could
not
long
escape
the
jealous
eyes
of
the
young
lady
no
more
than
the
cause
of
this
alienation
which
in
a
moment
converted
all
her
love
into
irreconcilable
hate
and
filled
her
whole
soul
with
the
most
eager
desire
of
vengeance
for
she
now
not
only
considered
him
as
a
mercenary
wretch
who
had
slighted
her
attractions
for
the
sordid
gratifications
of
avarice
but
also
as
an
interloper
who
wanted
to
intercept
her
fortune

the
odious
character
of

manifest
by

the
sentiments
she
entertained
in
favour
of
her
physician

as
the

will
easily
perceive
had
more
reasons
than

contrary
effect

in

was
in

days
called
to
the
wife
of
a
merchant
who
piously
hoped
that
his
practice
would
not
give

lie
the
patient
had
long
lingered
under
a
complication
of
distempers
and
being

life
doctor

was
in
no

to
strike
a

till
the
husband
growing
impatient
of
delay
and
so
explicit
in
his
hints
that
it
was
impossible
to
misapprehend
his
meaning
our
adventurer
resolved
to
do
something
effectual
for
his
satisfaction
and
prescribed
a
medicine
of
such
rough
operation
as
he
thought
must
either
oblige
his
employer
or
produce
a
change
in
the
lady
constitution
that
would
make
a
noise
in
the
world
and
bring
a
new
accession
to
his
fame
proceeding
upon
these
maxims
he
could
not
be
disappointed
the
remedy
played
its
part
with
such
violence
as
reduced
the
patient
to
extremity
and
the
merchant
had
actually
bespoke
an
undertaker
when
after
a
series
of
swoonings
and
convulsions
nature
so
far
prevailed
as
to
expel
at
once
the
prescription
and
the
disease
yet
the
husband
was
so
much
affected
with
the
agonies
to
which
he
saw
the
wife
of
his
bosom
exposed
by
this
specific
that
although
the
effect
of
it
was
her
perfect
recovery
he
could
never
bear
the
sight
of
fathom
for
the
future
nor
even
hear
his
name
mentioned
without
giving
signs
of
horror
and
indignation
nay
he
did
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
had
our
adventurer
been
endowed
with
the
least
tincture
of
humanity
he
would
have
suffered
the
poor
woman
to
depart
in
peace
rather
than
restore
her
to
health
at
the
expense
of
such
anxiety
and
torture
on
the
other
hand
this
extraordinary
cure
was
blazoned
abroad
by
the
good
lady
and
her
gossips
with
such
exaggerations
as
roused
the
astonishment
of
the
public
and
concurred
with
the
report
of
his
last
miscarriage
to
bring
him
upon
the
carpet
as
the
universal
subject
of
discourse
when
a
physician
becomes
the
town
talk
he
generally
concludes
his
business
more
than
half
done
even
though
his
fame
should
wholly
turn
upon
his
malpractice
insomuch
that
some
members
of
the
faculty
have
been
heard
to
complain
that
they
never
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
publicly
accused
of
homicide
and
it
is
well
known
that
a
certain
famous
empiric
of
our
day
never
flourished
to
any
degree
of
wealth
and
reputation
till
after
he
had
been
attacked
in
print
and
fairly
convicted
of
having
destroyed
a
good
number
of
the
human
species
success
raised
upon
such
a
foundation
would
by
a
disciple
of
plato
and
some
modern
moralists
be
ascribed
to
the
innate
virtue
and
generosity
of
the
human
heart
which
naturally
espouses
the
cause
that
needs
protection
but
i
whose
notions
of
human
excellence
are
not
quite
so
sublime
am
apt
to
believe
it
is
owing
to
that
spirit
of
and
contradiction
which
is
at
least
as
universal
if
not
as
natural
as
the
moral
sense
so
warmly
contended
for
by
those
ideal
philosophers
the
most
infamous
wretch
often
finds
his
account
in
these
principles
of
malevolence
and
for
wheresoever
his
character
falls
under
discussion
there
is
generally
some
person
present
who
either
from
an
affectation
of
singularity
or
envy
to
the
accusers
undertakes
his
defence
and
endeavours
to
invalidate
the
articles
of
his
impeachment
until
he
is
heated
by
altercation
and
hurried
into
more
effectual
measures
for
his
advantage
if
such
benefits
accrue
to
those
who
have
no
real
merit
to
depend
upon
surely
our
hero
could
not
but
reap
something
extraordinary
from
the
debates
to
which
he
now
gave
rise
as
by
the
miraculous
cure
he
had
affected
all
his
patient
friends
all
the
enemies
of
her
husband
all
those
who
envied
his
other
adversary
were
interested
in
his
behalf
exclusive
of
such
admirers
as
surprise
and
curiosity
might
engage
in
his
cause
thus
wafted
upon
the
wings
of
applause
his
fame
soon
diffused
itself
into
all
the
corners
of
this
great
capital
the
newspapers
teemed
with
his
praise
and
in
order
to
keep
up
the
attention
of
the
public
his
emissaries
male
and
female
separated
into
different
companies
and
clubs
where
they
did
not
fail
to
comment
upon
these
articles
of
intelligence
such
a
favourable
incident
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
float
the
bark
of
a
man
fortune
he
was
in
a
few
days
called
to
another
lady
labouring
under
the
same
disorder
he
had
so
successfully
dispelled
and
she
thought
herself
benefited
by
his
advice
his
acquaintance
naturally
extended
itself
among
the
visitants
and
allies
of
his
patients
he
was
recommended
from
family
to
family
the
fees
began
to
multiply
a
variety
of
footmen
appeared
every
day
at
his
door
he
discontinued
his
sham
circuit
and
looking
upon
the
present
conjuncture
as
that
tide
in
his
affairs
which
according
to
shakespeare
when
taken
at
the
full
leads
on
to
fortune
he
resolved
that
the
opportunity
should
not
be
lost
and
applied
himself
with
such
assiduity
to
his
practice
that
in
all
likelihood
he
would
have
carried
the
palm
from
all
his
contemporaries
had
he
not
split
upon
the
same
rock
which
had
shipwrecked
his
hopes
before
we
have
formerly
descanted
upon
that
venereal
appetite
which
glowed
in
the
constitution
of
our
adventurer
and
with
all
his
philosophy
and
caution
could
hardly
keep
within
bounds
the
reader
therefore
will
not
be
much
surprised
to
learn
that
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
he
contracted
an
intimacy
with
a
clergyman
wife
whom
he
attended
as
a
physician
and
whose
conjugal
virtue
he
subdued
by
a
long
and
diligent
exertion
of
his
delusive
arts
while
her
mind
was
enervated
by
sickness
and
her
husband
abroad
upon
his
necessary
occasions
this
unhappy
patient
who
was
a
woman
of
an
agreeable
person
and
lively
conversation
fell
a
sacrifice
to
her
own
security
and
her
want
of
health
had
confined
her
to
a
sedentary
life
and
her
imagination
being
active
and
restless
she
had
spent
those
hours
in
reading
which
other
young
women
devote
to
company
and
diversion
but
as
her
studies
were
not
superintended
by
any
person
of
taste
she
had
indulged
her
own
fancy
without
method
or
propriety
the
spectator
taught
her
to
be
a
critic
and
philosopher
from
plays
she
learned
poetry
and
wit
and
derived
her
knowledge
of
life
from
books
of
history
and
adventures
fraught
with
these
acquisitions
and
furnished
by
nature
with
uncommon
vivacity
she
despised
her
own
sex
and
courted
the
society
of
men
among
whom
she
thought
her
talents
might
be
more
honourably
displayed
fully
confident
of
her
own
virtue
and
sagacity
which
enabled
her
to
set
all
their
arts
at
defiance
thus
qualified
she
in
an
evil
hour
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
our
adventurer
for
some
ailment
under
which
she
had
long
laboured
and
found
such
relief
from
his
skill
as
very
much
prepossessed
her
in
his
favour
she
was
no
less
pleased
with
his
obliging
manners
than
with
his
physic
and
found
much
entertainment
in
his
conversation
so
that
the
acquaintance
proceeded
to
a
degree
of
intimacy
during
which
he
perceived
her
weak
side
and
being
enamoured
of
her
person
flattered
her
out
of
all
her
caution
the
privilege
of
his
character
furnished
him
with
opportunities
to
lay
snares
for
her
virtue
and
taking
advantage
of
that
listlessness
languor
and
indolence
of
the
spirits
by
which
all
the
vigilance
of
the
soul
is
relaxed
he
after
a
long
course
of
attention
and
perseverance
found
means
to
make
shipwreck
of
her
peace
though
he
mastered
her
chastity
he
could
not
quiet
her
conscience
which
incessantly
upbraided
her
with
breach
of
the
marriage
vow
nor
did
her
undoer
escape
without
a
share
of
the
reproaches
suggested
by
her
penitence
and
remorse
this
internal
anxiety
with
her
disease
and
perhaps
with
the
medicines
he
prescribed
reduced
her
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
when
her
husband
returned
from
a
neighbouring
kingdom
in
consequence
of
her
earnest
request
joined
to
the
information
of
her
friends
who
had
written
to
him
an
account
of
the
extremity
in
which
she
was
the
good
man
was
afflicted
beyond
measure
when
he
saw
himself
upon
the
verge
of
losing
a
wife
whom
he
had
always
tenderly
loved
but
what
were
his
emotions
when
she
taking
the
first
opportunity
of
his
being
alone
with
her
accosted
him
to
this
effect
i
am
now
hastening
towards
that
dissolution
from
which
no
mortal
is
exempted
and
though
the
prospect
of
futurity
is
altogether
clouded
and
uncertain
my
conscience
will
not
allow
me
to
plunge
into
eternity
without
unburdening
my
mind
and
by
an
ingenuous
confession
making
all
the
atonement
in
my
power
for
the
ingratitude
i
have
been
guilty
of
and
the
wrongs
i
have
committed
against
a
virtuous
husband
who
never
gave
me
cause
of
complaint
you
stand
amazed
at
this
preamble
but
alas
how
will
you
be
shocked
when
i
own
that
i
have
betrayed
you
in
your
absence
that
i
have
trespassed
against
god
and
my
marriage
vow
and
fallen
from
the
pride
and
confidence
of
virtue
to
the
most
abject
state
of
vice
yes
i
have
been
unfaithful
to
your
bed
having
fallen
a
victim
to
the
infernal
insinuations
of
a
villain
who
took
advantage
of
my
weak
and
unguarded
moments
fathom
is
the
wretch
who
hath
thus
injured
your
honour
and
ruined
my
unsuspecting
innocence
i
have
nothing
to
plead
in
alleviation
of
my
crime
but
the
most
sincere
contrition
of
heart
and
though
at
any
other
juncture
i
could
not
expect
your
forgiveness
yet
as
i
now
touch
the
goal
of
life
i
trust
in
your
humanity
and
benevolence
for
that
pardon
which
will
lighten
the
sorrows
of
my
soul
and
those
prayers
which
i
hope
will
entitle
me
to
favour
at
the
throne
of
grace
the
poor
husband
was
so
much
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
confusion
at
this
unexpected
address
that
he
could
not
recollect
himself
till
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes
when
uttering
a
hollow
groan
i
will
not
said
he
aggravate
your
sufferings
by
reproaching
you
with
my
wrongs
though
your
conduct
hath
been
but
an
ill
return
for
all
my
tenderness
and
esteem
i
look
upon
it
as
a
trial
of
my
christian
patience
and
bear
my
misfortune
with
resignation
meanwhile
i
forgive
you
from
my
heart
and
fervently
pray
that
your
repentance
may
be
acceptable
to
the
father
of
mercy
so
saying
he
approached
her
bedside
and
embraced
her
in
token
of
his
sincerity
whether
this
generous
condescension
diffused
such
a
composure
upon
her
spirits
as
tended
to
the
ease
and
refreshment
of
nature
which
had
been
almost
exhausted
by
disease
and
vexation
certain
it
is
that
from
this
day
she
began
to
struggle
with
her
malady
in
surprising
efforts
and
hourly
gained
ground
until
her
health
was
pretty
well
this
recovery
was
so
far
beyond
the
husband
expectation
that
he
began
to
make
very
serious
reflections
on
the
event
and
even
to
wish
he
had
not
been
quite
so
precipitate
in
pardoning
the
backslidings
of
his
wife
for
though
he
could
not
withhold
his
compassion
from
a
dying
penitent
he
did
not
at
all
relish
the
thoughts
of
cohabiting
as
usual
with
a
wife
of
the
violation
of
the
matrimonial
contract
he
therefore
considered
his
declaration
as
no
more
than
a
provisional
pardon
to
take
place
on
condition
of
her
immediate
death
and
in
a
little
time
not
only
communicated
to
her
his
sentiments
on
this
subject
but
also
separated
himself
from
her
company
secured
the
evidence
of
her
maid
who
had
been
confidant
in
her
amour
with
fathom
and
immediately
set
on
foot
a
prosecution
against
our
adventurer
whose
behaviour
to
his
wife
he
did
not
fail
to
promulgate
with
all
its
aggravating
circumstances
by
these
means
the
doctor
name
became
so
notorious
that
every
man
was
afraid
of
admitting
him
into
his
house

of
soliciting

whose
attractions
were
so
slender

considering
the
ill
state
of
her
health

circumstance
that
seldom
adds
to
a
woman

or
besides
she
was
always
a
pert
minx
that
affected
singularity
and
a
masculine
manner
of
speaking
and
many
of
them
had
foreseen
that
she
would
some

herself
into

a

of

ignorance

presumption

quoted

feigned

situation
of
a
horseman
who
in
riding
at
full
speed
for
the
plate
is
thrown
from
the
saddle
in
the
middle
of
the
race
and
left
without
sense
or
motion
upon
the
plain
his
progress
though
rapid
had
been
so
short
that
he
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
laid
up
store
against
such
a
day
of
trouble
and
as
he
still
cherished
hopes
of
surmounting
those
obstacles
which
had
so
suddenly
started
up
in
his
way
he
would
not
resign
his
equipage
nor
retrench
his
expenses
but
appeared
as
usual
in
all
public
places
with
that
serenity
and
confidence
of
feature
which
he
had
never
deposited
and
maintained
his
external
pomp
upon
the
little
he
had
reserved
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
and
the
credit
he
had
acquired
by
the
punctuality
of
his
former
payments
both
these
funds
however
failed
in
a
very
little
time
his
lawsuit
was
a
gulf
that
swallowed
up
all
his
ready
money
and
the
gleanings
of
his
practice
were
scarce
sufficient
to
answer
his
pocket
expenses
which
now
increased
in
proportion
to
the
decrease
of
business
for
as
he
had
more
idle
time
and
was
less
admitted
into
private
families
so
he
thought
he
had
more
occasion
to
enlarge
his
acquaintance
among
his
own
sex
who
alone
were
able
to
support
him
in
his
disgrace
with
the
other
he
accordingly
listed
himself
in
several
clubs
and
endeavoured
to
monopolise
the
venereal
branch
of
trade
though
this
was
but
an
indifferent
resource
for
almost
all
his
patients
of
this
class
were
such
as
either
could
not
or
would
not
properly
recompense
the
physician
for
some
time
he
lingered
in
this
situation
without
going
upwards
or
downwards
floating
like
a
wisp
of
straw
at
the
turning
of
the
tide
until
he
could
no
longer
amuse
the
person
of
whom
he
had
hired
his
or
postpone
the
other
demands
which
multiplied
upon
him
every
day
then
was
his
chariot
overturned
with
a
hideous
crash
and
his
face
so
much
wounded
with
the
shivers
of
the
glass
which
went
to
pieces
in
the
fall
that
he
appeared
in
the
with
half
a
dozen
black
patches
upon
his
countenance
gave
a
most
circumstantial
detail
of
the
risk
he
had
run
and
declared
that
he
did
not
believe
he
should
ever
hazard
himself
again
in
any
sort
of
wheel
carriage
soon
after
this
accident
he
took
an
opportunity
of
telling
his
friends
in
the
same
public
place
that
he
had
turned
away
his
footman
on
account
of
his
drunkenness
and
was
resolved
for
the
future
to
keep
none
but
maids
in
his
service
because
the
menservants
are
generally
impudent
lazy
debauched
or
dishonest
and
after
all
neither
so
neat
handy
or
agreeable
as
the
other
sex
in
the
rear
of
this
resolution
he
shifted
his
lodgings
into
a
private
court
being
distracted
with
the
din
of
carriages
that
disturb
the
inhabitants
who
live
towards
the
open
street
and
gave
his
acquaintance
to
understand
that
he
had
a
medical
work
upon
the
anvil
which
he
could
not
finish
without
being
indulged
in
silence
and
tranquillity
in
effect
he
gradually
put
on
the
exteriors
of
an
author
his
watch
with
an
horizontal
movement
by
graham
which
he
had
often
mentioned
and
shown
as
a
very
curious
piece
of
workmanship
began
about
this
time
to
be
very
much
out
of
order
and
was
committed
to
the
care
of
a
mender
who
was
in
no
hurry
to
restore
it
his
degenerated
into
a
major
he
sometimes
appeared
without
a
sword
and
was
even
observed
in
public
with
a
second
day
shirt
at
last
his
clothes
became
rusty
and
when
he
walked
about
the
streets
his
head
turned
round
in
a
surprising
manner
by
an
involuntary
motion
in
his
neck
which
he
had
contracted
by
a
habit
of
reconnoitring
the
ground
that
he
might
avoid
all
dangerous
or
disagreeable
encounters
fathom
finding
himself
descending
the
hill
of
fortune
with
an
acquired
gravitation
strove
to
catch
at
every
twig
in
order
to
stop
or
retard
his
descent
he
now
regretted
the
opportunities
he
had
neglected
of
marrying
one
of
several
women
of
moderate
fortune
who
had
made
advances
to
him
in
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
and
endeavoured
by
forcing
himself
into
a
lower
path
of
life
than
any
he
had
hitherto
trod
to
keep
himself
afloat
with
the
portion
of
some
tradesman
daughter
whom
he
meant
to
espouse
while
he
exerted
himself
in
this
pursuit
he
happened
in
returning
from
a
place
about
thirty
miles
from
london
to
become
acquainted
in
the
with
a
young
woman
of
a
very
homely
appearance
whom
from
the
driver
information
he
understood
to
be
the
niece
of
a
country
justice
and
daughter
of
a
who
had
lived
and
died
in
london
and
left
her
in
her
infancy
sole
heiress
of
his
effects
which
amounted
to
four
thousand
pounds
the
uncle
who
was
her
guardian
had
kept
her
sacred
from
the
knowledge
of
the
world
resolving
to
effect
a
match
betwixt
her
and
his
own
son
and
it
was
with
much
difficulty
he
had
consented
to
this
journey
which
she
had
undertaken
as
a
visit
to
her
own
mother
who
had
married
a
second
husband
in
town
fraught
with
these
anecdotes
fathom
began
to
put
forth
his
gallantry
and
and
in
a
word
was
admitted
by
the
lady
to
the
privilege
of
an
acquaintance
in
which
capacity
he
visited
her
during
the
term
of
her
residence
in
london
and
as
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
declared
his
honourable
intentions
he
had
such
a
manifest
advantage
in
point
of
personal
accomplishments
over
the
young
gentleman
who
was
destined
for
her
husband
that
she
did
not
disdain
his
proposals
and
before
she
set
out
for
the
country
he
had
made
such
progress
in
her
heart
that
the
day
was
actually
fixed
for
their
nuptials
on
which
he
faithfully
promised
to
carry
her
off
in
a
coach
and
six
how
to
raise
money
for
this
expedition
was
all
the
difficulty
that
remained
for
by
this
time
his
finances
were
utterly
dried
up
and
his
credit
altogether
exhausted
upon
a
very
pressing
occasion
he
had
formerly
applied
himself
to
a
certain
wealthy
quack
who
had
relieved
his
necessities
by
lending
him
a
small
sum
of
money
in
return
for
having
communicated
to
him
a
secret
medicine
which
he
affirmed
to
be
the
most
admirable
specific
that
ever
was
invented
the
nostrum
had
been
used
and
luckily
for
him
succeeded
in
the
trial
so
that
the
empiric
in
the
midst
of
his
satisfaction
began
to
reflect
that
this
same
fathom
who
pretended
to
be
in
possession
of
a
great
many
remedies
equally
efficacious
would
certainly
become
a
formidable
rival
to
him
in
his
business
should
he
ever
be
able
to
extricate
himself
from
his
present
difficulties
in
consequence
of
these
suggestions
he
resolved
to
keep
our
head
under
water
by
maintaining
him
in
the
most
abject
dependence
accordingly
he
had
from
time
to
time
accommodated
him
with
small
trifles
which
barely
served
to
support
his
existence
and
even
for
these
had
taken
notes
of
hand
that
he
might
have
a
scourge
over
his
head
in
case
he
should
prove
insolent
or
refractory
to
this
benefactor
fathom
applied
for
a
reinforcement
of
twenty
guineas
which
he
solicited
with
the
more
confidence
as
that
sum
would
certainly
enable
him
to
repay
all
other
obligations
the
quack
would
advance
the
money
upon
no
other
condition
than
that
of
knowing
the
scheme
which
being
explained
he
complied
with
ferdinand
request
but
at
the
same
time
privately
despatched
an
express
to
the
young
lady
uncle
with
a
full
account
of
the
whole
conspiracy
so
that
when
the
doctor
arrived
at
the
inn
according
to
appointment
he
was
received
by
his
worship
in
person
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
niece
had
changed
her
mind
and
gone
fifty
miles
farther
into
the
country
to
visit
a
relation
this
was
a
grievous
disappointment
to
fathom
who
really
believed
his
mistress
had
forsaken
him
through
mere
levity
and
caprice
and
was
not
undeceived
till
several
months
after
her
marriage
with
her
cousin
when
at
an
accidental
meeting
in
london
she
explained
the
story
of
the
secret
intelligence
and
excused
her
marriage
as
the
effect
of
rigorous
usage
and
compulsion
had
our
hero
been
really
enamoured
of
her
person
he
might
have
probably
accomplished
his
wishes
notwithstanding
the
steps
she
had
taken
but
this
was
not
the
case
his
passion
was
of
a
different
nature
and
the
object
of
it
effectually
without
his
reach
with
regard
to
his
appetite
for
women
as
it
was
an
infirmity
of
his
constitution
which
he
could
not
overcome
and
as
he
was
in
no
condition
to
gratify
it
at
a
great
expense
he
had
of
late
chosen
a
housekeeper
from
the
hundreds
of
drury
and
to
avoid
scandal
allowed
her
to
assume
his
name
as
to
the
intimation
which
had
been
sent
to
the
country
justice
he
immediately
imputed
it
to
the
true
author
whom
he
marked
for
his
vengeance
accordingly
but
in
the
meantime
suppressed
his
resentment
because
he
in
some
measure
depended
upon
him
for
subsistence
on
the
other
hand
the
quack
dreading
the
forwardness
and
plausibility
of
our
hero
which
might
one
time
or
other
render
him
independent
put
a
stop
to
those
supplies
on
pretence
of
finding
them
inconvenient
but
out
of
his
friendship
and
goodwill
to
fathom
undertook
to
procure
for
him
such
letters
of
recommendation
as
would
infallibly
make
his
fortune
in
the
west
indies
and
even
to
set
him
out
in
a
genteel
manner
for
the
voyage
ferdinand
perceived
his
drift
and
thanked
him
for
his
generous
offer
which
he
would
not
fail
to
consider
with
all
due
deliberation
though
he
was
determined
against
the
proposal
but
obliged
to
temporise
that
he
might
not
incur
the
displeasure
of
this
man
at
whose
mercy
he
lay
meanwhile
the
prosecution
against
him
in
doctors
commons
drew
near
a
period
and
the
lawyers
were
clamorous
for
money
without
which
he
foresaw
he
should
lose
the
advantage
which
his
cause
had
lately
acquired
by
the
death
of
his
antagonist
chief
evidence
he
therefore
seeing
every
other
channel
shut
up
began
to
doubt
whether
the
risk
of
being
apprehended
or
slain
in
the
character
of
a
highwayman
was
not
overbalanced
by
the
prospect
of
being
acquitted
of
a
charge
which
had
ruined
his
reputation
and
fortune
and
actually
entertained
thoughts
of
taking
the
air
on
hounslow
heath
when
he
was
diverted
from
this
expedient
by
a
very
singular
adventure
chapter
after
divers
unsuccessful
efforts
he
has
recourse
to
the
matrimonial
noose
chancing
to
meet
with
one
of
his
acquaintance
at
a
certain
the
discourse
turned
upon
the
characters
of
mankind
when
among
other
oddities
his
friend
brought
upon
the
carpet
a
certain
old
gentlewoman
of
such
a
rapacious
disposition
that
like
a
jackdaw
she
never
beheld
any
metalline
substance
without
an
inclination
and
even
an
effort
to
secrete
it
for
her
own
use
and
contemplation
nor
was
this
infirmity
originally
produced
from
indigence
inasmuch
as
her
circumstances
had
been
always
affluent
and
she
was
now
possessed
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
the
funds
notwithstanding
which
the
avarice
of
her
nature
tempted
her
to
let
lodgings
though
few
people
could
live
under
the
same
roof
with
such
an
original
who
rather
than
be
idle
had
often
filched
pieces
of
her
own
plate
and
charged
her
servants
with
the
theft
or
hinted
suspicion
of
her
lodgers
fathom
struck
with
the
description
soon
perceived
how
this
woman
disease
might
be
converted
to
his
advantage
and
after
having
obtained
sufficient
intelligence
on
pretence
of
satisfying
his
curiosity
he
visited
the
widow
in
consequence
of
a
bill
at
her
door
and
actually
hired
an
apartment
in
her
house
whither
he
forthwith
repaired
with
his
inamorata
it
was
not
long
before
he
perceived
that
his
landlady
character
had
not
been
misrepresented
he
fed
her
distemper
with
divers
inconsiderable
trinkets
such
as
copper
medals
corkscrews
odd
buckles
and
a
paltry
seal
set
in
silver
which
were
at
different
times
laid
as
baits
for
her
infirmity
and
always
conveyed
away
with
remarkable
eagerness
which
he
and
his
dulcinea
took
pleasure
in
observing
from
an
unsuspected
place
thus
confirmed
in
his
opinion
he
at
length
took
an
opportunity
of
exposing
a
metal
watch
that
belonged
to
his
mistress
and
saw
it
seized
with
great
satisfaction
in
the
absence
of
his
helpmate
who
had
gone
abroad
on
purpose
according
to
instruction
she
soon
returned
and
began
to
raise
a
terrible
clamour
about
the
loss
of
her
watch
upon
which
she
was
condoled
by
her
landlady
who
seemed
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
maid
and
even
proposed
that
fathom
should
apply
to
some
justice
of
the
peace
for
a
warrant
to
search
the
servant
trunk
the
lady
thanked
her
for
the
good
advice
in
compliance
with
which
she
had
immediate
recourse
to
a
magistrate
who
granted
a
search
warrant
not
against
the
maid
but
the
mistress
and
she
in
a
little
time
returned
with
the
constable
at
her
back
these
precautions
being
taken
doctor
fathom
desired
a
private
conference
with
the
old
gentlewoman
in
which
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
had
undoubted
proofs
of
her
having
secreted
not
only
the
watch
but
also
several
other
odd
things
of
less
consequence
which
he
lost
since
his
residence
in
her
house
he
then
showed
the
warrant
he
had
obtained
against
her
and
asked
if
she
had
anything
to
offer
why
the
constable
should
not
do
his
duty
inexpressible
were
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
the
defendant
when
she
found
herself
thus
entrapped
and
reflected
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
being
detected
of
felony
for
she
at
once
concluded
that
the
snare
was
laid
for
her
and
knew
that
the
officer
of
justice
would
certainly
find
the
unlucky
watch
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
her
scrutoire
tortured
with
these
suggestions
afraid
of
public
disgrace
and
dreading
the
consequence
of
legal
conviction
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
injured
fathom
and
after
having
imputed
her
crime
to
the
temptations
of
necessity
implored
his
compassion
promised
to
restore
the
watch
and
everything
she
had
taken
and
begged
he
would
dismiss
the
constable
that
her
reputation
might
not
suffer
in
the
eye
of
the
world
ferdinand
with
a
severity
of
countenance
purposely
assumed
observed
that
were
she
really
indigent
he
had
charity
enough
to
forgive
what
she
had
done
but
as
he
knew
her
circumstances
were
opulent
he
looked
upon
this
excuse
as
an
aggravation
of
her
guilt
which
was
certainly
the
effect
of
a
vicious
inclination
and
he
was
therefore
determined
to
prosecute
her
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
as
an
example
and
terror
to
others
who
might
be
infected
with
the
same
evil
disposition
finding
him
deaf
to
all
her
tears
and
entreaties
she
changed
her
note
and
offered
him
one
hundred
guineas
if
he
would
compromise
the
affair
and
drop
the
prosecution
so
as
that
her
character
should
sustain
no
damage
after
much
argumentation
he
consented
to
accept
of
double
the
sum
which
being
instantly
paid
in
east
india
bonds
doctor
fathom
told
the
constable
that
the
watch
was
found
and
for
once
her
reputation
was
patched
up
this
seasonable
supply
enabled
our
hero
to
stand
trial
with
his
adversary
who
was
nonsuited
and
also
to
mend
his
external
appearance
which
of
late
had
not
been
extremely
magnificent

gleam
of
good

he
was

indebted

to

acquaintance
of
a
young
widow
who
lodged
at
his
house
and
was
said
to
be
in
possession
of
a
considerable
fortune
considering
the
steps
that
were
taken
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
him
to
miscarry

his

the

with

very
sanguine
disposition

her
short
trial

cool

call
at

drinking
tea
with
her
landlady
on
these
occasions
he
always
behaved
to
admiration
she
liked
his
person
and
praised
his
politeness
and
good
sense
his
confederates
extolled
him
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
taste
and
they
likewise
represented
him
as
a
person
on
the
eve
of
eclipsing
all
his
competitors
in
physic
an
acquaintance
and
intimacy
soon
ensued
nor
was
he
restricted
in
point
of
opportunity
in
a
word
he
succeeded
in
his
endeavours
and
one
evening
on
pretence
of
attending
her
to
the
play
he
accompanied
her
to
the
fleet
where
they
were
married
in
presence
of
the
tradesman
and
his
wife
who
were
of
the
party
this
grand
affair
being
accomplished
to
his
satisfaction
he
next
day
visited
her
brother
who
was
a
counsellor
of
the
temple
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
step
his
sister
had
taken
and
though
the
lawyer
was
not
a
little
mortified
to
find
that
she
had
made
such
a
clandestine
match
he
behaved
civilly
to
his
new
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
wife
fortune
consisted
of
a
jointure
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
fifteen
hundred
pounds
bequeathed
to
her
during
her
widowhood
by
her
own
father
who
had
taken
the
precaution
of
settling
it
in
the
hands
of
trustees
in
such
a
manner
as
that
any
husband
she
might
afterwards
espouse
should
be
restricted
from
encroaching
upon
the
capital
which
was
reserved
for
the
benefit
of
her
heirs
this
intimation
was
far
from
being
agreeable
to
our
hero
who
had
been
informed
that
this
sum
was
absolutely
at
the
lady
disposal
and
had
actually
destined
the
greatest
part
of
it
for
the
payment
of
his
debts
for
defraying
the
expense
of
furnishing
an
elegant
house
and
setting
up
a
new
equipage
notwithstanding
this
disappointment
he
resolved
to
carry
on
his
plan
upon
the
credit
of
his
marriage
which
was
published
in
a
very
pompous
article
of
the
newspapers
a
chariot
was
bespoke
a
ready
furnished
house
immediately
taken
and
doctor
fathom
began
to
reappear
in
all
his
former
splendour
his
good
friend
the
empiric
alarmed
at
this
event
which
not
only
raised
our
adventurer
into
the
sphere
of
a
dangerous
rival
but
also
furnished
him
with
means
to
revenge
the
ill
office
he
had
sustained
at
his
hands
on
the
adventure
of
the
former
match
for
by
this
time
fathom
had
given
him
some
hints
importing
that
he
was
not
ignorant
of
his
treacherous
behaviour
roused
i
say
by
these
considerations
he
employed
one
of
his
emissaries
who
had
some
knowledge
of
fathom
to
prejudice
him
against
our
adventurer
whom
he
represented
as
a
needy
sharper
not
only
overwhelmed
with
debt
and
disgrace
but
likewise
previously
married
to
a
poor
woman
who
was
prevented
by
nothing
but
want
from
seeking
redress
at
law
to
confirm
these
assertions
he
gave
him
a
detail
of
fathom
encumbrances
which
he
had
learned
for
the
purpose
and
even
brought
the
counsellor
into
company
with
the
person
who
had
lived
with
our
hero
before
marriage
and
who
was
so
much
incensed
at
her
abrupt
dismission
that
she
did
not
scruple
to
corroborate
these
allegations
of
the
informer
the
lawyer
startled
at
this
intelligence
set
on
foot
a
minute
inquiry
into
the
life
and
conversation
of
the
doctor
which
turned
out
so
little
to
the
advantage
of
his
character
and
circumstances
that
he
resolved
if
possible
to
disunite
him
from
his
family
and
as
a
previous
step
repeated
to
his
sister
all
that
he
had
heard
to
the
prejudice
of
her
husband
not
forgetting
to
produce
the
evidence
of
his
mistress
who
laid
claim
to
him
by
a
prior
title
which
she
pretended
could
be
proved
by
the
testimony
of
the
clergyman
who
joined
them
such
an
explanation
could
not
fail
to
inflame
the
resentment
of
the
injured
wife
who
at
the
very
first
opportunity
giving
a
loose
to
the
impetuosity
of
her
temper
upbraided
our
hero
with
the
most
bitter
invectives
for
his
perfidious
dealing
ferdinand
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
which
he
had
not
always
to
plead
far
from
attempting
to
soothe
her
indignation
assumed
the
authority
and
prerogative
of
a
husband
and
sharply
reprehended
her
for
her
credulity
and
indecent
warmth
this
rebuke
instead
of
silencing
gave
new
spirit
and
volubility
to
her
reproaches
in
the
course
of
which
she
plainly
taxed
him
with
want
of
honesty
and
affection
and
said
that
though
his
pretence
was
love
his
aim
was
no
other
than
a
base
design
upon
her
fortune
fathom
stung
with
these
accusations
which
he
really
did
not
deserve
replied
with
uncommon
heat
and
charged
her
in
his
turn
with
want
of
sincerity
and
candour
in
the
false
account
she
had
given
of
that
same
fortune
before
marriage
he
even
magnified
his
own
condescension
in
surrendering
his
liberty
to
a
woman
who
had
so
little
to
recommend
her
to
the
addresses
of
the
other
sex
a
reflection
which
provoked
this
mild
creature
to
such
a
degree
of
animosity
that
forgetting
her
duty
and
allegiance
she
lent
him
a
box
on
the
ear
with
such
energy
as
made
his
eyes
water
and
he
for
the
honour
of
manhood
and
sovereignty
having
washed
her
face
with
a
dish
of
tea
withdrew
abruptly
to
a
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
had
not
long
remained
when
his
passion
subsided
and
he
then
saw
the
expediency
of
an
immediate
reconciliation
which
he
resolved
to
purchase
even
at
the
expense
of
a
submission
it
was
pity
that
such
a
salutary
resolution
had
not
been
sooner
taken
for
when
he
returned
to
his
own
house
he
understood
that
fathom
had
gone
abroad
in
a
and
upon
examining
her
apartment
in
lieu
of
her
clothes
and
trinkets
which
she
had
removed
with
admirable
dexterity
and
despatch
he
found
this
billet
in
one
of
the
drawers
of
her
bureau
sir
being
convinced
that
you
are
a
cheat
and
an
impostor
i
have
withdrawn
myself
from
your
cruelty
and
machinations
with
a
view
to
solicit
the
protection
of
the
law
and
i
doubt
not
but
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
prove
that
you
have
no
just
title
to
or
demand
upon
the
person
or
effects
of
the
unfortunate
sarah
muddy
the
time
had
been
when
fathom
would
have
allowed
muddy
to
refine
at
her
leisure
and
blessed
god
for
his
happy
deliverance
but
at
present
the
case
was
quite
altered
smarting
as
he
was
from
the
expense
of
lawsuits
he
dreaded
a
prosecution
for
bigamy
which
though
he
had
justice
on
his
side
he
knew
he
could
not
of
himself
support
besides
all
his
other
schemes
of
life
were
frustrated
by
this
unlucky
elopement
he
therefore
speedily
determined
to
anticipate
as
much
as
in
him
lay
the
malice
of
his
enemies
and
to
obtain
without
delay
authentic
documents
of
his
marriage
with
this
view
he
hastened
to
the
house
of
the
tradesman
who
with
his
wife
had
been
witness
to
the
ceremony
and
consummation
and
in
order
to
interest
them
the
more
warmly
in
his
cause
made
a
pathetic
recital
of
this
unhappy
breach
in
which
he
had
suffered
such
injury
and
insult
but
all
his
rhetoric
would
not
avail
muddy
had
been
beforehand
with
him
and
had
proved
the
better
orator
of
the
two
for
she
had
assailed
this
honest
couple
with
such
tropes
and
figures
of
eloquence
as
were
altogether
irresistible
nevertheless
they
heard
our
hero
to
an
end
with
great
patience
then
the
wife
who
was
the
common
mouth
upon
all
such
occasions
contracting
her
features
into
a
very
formal
disposition
i
assure
you
said
she
doctor
fathom
my
husband
and
i
have
been
in
a
very
great
terrification
and
numplush
to
hear
such
bad
things
of
a
person
whom
as
one
may
say
we
thought
a
worthy
gentleman
and
were
ready
to
serve
at
all
times
by
day
and
by
night
as
the
saying
is
and
besides
for
all
that
you
know
and
god
knows
as
we
are
dustrious
people
and
work
hard
for
what
we
get
and
we
have
served
gentlemen
to
our
own
harm
whereby
my
husband
was
last
tuesday
served
with
a
siserary
being
that
he
was
bound
for
an
officer
that
ran
away
and
i
said
to
my
husband
timothy
says
i
is
a
very
hard
thing
for
one
to
ruin
one
self
for
stranger
people
there
doctor
fathom
says
i
his
account
comes
to
pounds
seven
shillings
and
fourpence
halfpenny
and
you
know
doctor
that
was
before
your
last
bill
began
but
howsomever
little
did
i
think
as
how
a
gentleman
of
your
learning
would
go
to
deceive
a
poor
gentlewoman
when
you
had
another
wife
alive
in
vain
did
our
adventurer
endeavour
to
vindicate
himself
from
this
aspersion
the
good
woman
like
a
great
many
modern
disputants
proceeded
with
her
declamation
without
seeming
to
hear
what
was
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
the
husband
was
altogether
neutral
at
length
ferdinand
finding
all
his
protestations
ineffectual
well
said
he
though
you
are
resolved
i
see
to
discredit
all
that
i
can
say
in
opposition
to
that
scandalous
slander
of
which
i
can
easily
acquit
myself
in
a
court
of
justice
surely
you
will
not
refuse
to
grant
me
a
certificate
signifying
that
you
were
present
at
the
ceremony
of
my
marriage
with
this
unhappy
woman
you
shall
excuse
us
replied
the
female
orator
people
can
not
be
too
wary
in
signing
their
names
in
this
wicked
world
many
a
one
has
been
brought
to
ruination
by
signing
his
name
and
my
husband
shall
not
with
my
goodwill
draw
himself
into
such
a
primmineery
fathom
alarmed
at
this
refusal
earnestly
argued
against
the
inhumanity
and
injustice
of
it
appealing
to
their
own
consciences
for
the
reasonableness
of
his
proposal
but
from
the
evasive
answers
of
the
wife
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
long
before
the
time
of
trial
they
would
take
care
to
have
forgotten
the
whole
transaction
though
he
was
equally
confounded
and
incensed
at
this
instance
of
their
perfidy
he
durst
not
manifest
his
indignation
conscious
of
the
advantage
they
had
over
him
in
divers
respects
but
repaired
without
loss
of
time
to
the
lodging
of
the
clergyman
who
had
noosed
him
resolved
to
consult
his
register
and
secure
his
evidence
here
too
his
evil
genius
had
got
the
start
of
him
for
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
not
only
could
not
recollect
his
features
or
find
his
name
in
the
register
but
when
importuned
by
his
pressing
remonstrances
took
umbrage
at
the
freedom
of
his
behaviour
and
threatened
if
he
would
not
immediately
take
himself
away
to
raise
the
posse
of
the
fleet
for
the
safety
of
his
own
person
rather
than
put
the
pastor
to
the
trouble
of
alarming
his
flock
he
retreated
with
a
heavy
heart
and
went
in
quest
of
his
mistress
whom
he
had
dismissed
at
his
marriage
in
hopes
of
effecting
a
reconciliation
and
preventing
her
from
joining
in
the
conspiracy
against
him
but
alas
he
met
with
such
a
reception
as
he
had
reason
to
expect
from
a
slighted
woman
who
had
never
felt
any
real
attachment
for
his
person
she
did
not
upbraid
him
with
his
cruelty
in
leaving
her
as
a
mistress
but
with
a
species
of
effrontery
never
enough
to
be
admired
reproached
him
with
his
villany
in
abandoning
her
who
was
his
true
and
lawful
wife
to
go
and
ruin
a
poor
gentlewoman
by
whose
fortune
he
had
been
allured
when
he
attempted
to
expostulate
with
this
virago
upon
the
barbarity
of
this
assertion
she
very
prudently
declined
engaging
in
private
conversation
with
such
an
artful
and
wicked
man
and
calling
up
the
people
of
the
house
insisted
upon
his
being
conducted
to
the
door
chapter
in
which
his
fortune
is
effectually
strangled
the
last
resource
and
that
upon
which
he
least
depended
was
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
old
friend
the
empiric
with
whom
he
still
maintained
a
slight
correspondence
and
to
whose
house
he
steered
his
course
in
great
perplexity
and
tribulation
that
gentleman
instead
of
consoling
him
with
assurances
of
friendship
and
protection
faithfully
recapitulated
all
the
instances
of
his
indiscretion
and
misconduct
taxed
him
with
want
of
sincerity
in
the
west
india
affair
as
well
as
with
want
of
honesty
in
this
last
marriage
while
his
former
wife
was
alive
and
finally
reminded
him
of
his
notes
which
he
desired
might
be
immediately
taken
up
as
he
the
quack
had
present
occasion
for
a
sum
of
money
ferdinand
seeing
it
would
be
impracticable
to
derive
any
succour
from
this
quarter
sneaked
homewards
in
order
to
hold
a
consultation
with
his
own
thoughts
and
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
eyes
when
he
entered
his
apartment
was
a
letter
from
the
tradesman
with
his
account
inclosed
amounting
to
pounds
which
the
writer
desired
might
be
paid
without
delay
before
he
had
time
to
peruse
the
articles
he
received
a
summons
in
consequence
of
a
bill
of
indictment
for
bigamy
found
against
him
in
hicks
hall
by
sarah
muddy
widow
and
while
he
was
revolving
measures
to
avert
these
storms
another
billet
arrived
from
a
certain
attorney
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
had
orders
from
doctor
buffalo
the
quack
to
sue
him
for
the
payment
of
several
notes
unless
he
would
take
them
up
in
three
days
from
the
date
of
this
letter
such
a
concurrence
of
sinister
events
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
all
his
fortitude
was
insufficient
to
bear
him
up
against
this
torrent
of
misfortunes
his
resources
were
all
dried
up
his
invention
failed
and
his
reflection
began
to
take
a
new
turn
to
what
purpose
said
he
to
himself
have
i
deserted
the
paths
of
integrity
and
truth
and
exhausted
a
fruitful
imagination
in
contriving
schemes
to
betray
my
if
instead
of
acquiring
a
splendid
fortune
which
was
my
aim
i
have
suffered
such
a
series
of
mortifications
and
at
last
brought
myself
to
the
brink
of
inevitable
destruction
by
a
virtuous
exertion
of
those
talents
i
inherit
from
nature
and
education
i
might
long
before
this
time
have
rendered
myself
independent
and
perhaps
conspicuous
in
life
i
might
have
grown
up
like
a
young
oak
which
being
firmly
rooted
in
its
kindred
soil
gradually
raises
up
its
lofty
head
expands
its
leafy
arms
projects
a
noble
shade
and
towers
the
glory
of
the
plain
i
should
have
paid
the
debt
of
gratitude
to
my
benefactors
and
made
their
hearts
sing
with
joy
for
the
happy
effects
of
their
benevolence
i
should
have
been
a
bulwark
to
my
friends
a
shelter
to
my
neighbours
in
distress
i
should
have
run
the
race
of
honour
seen
my
fame
diffused
like
a
odour
and
felt
the
ineffable
pleasure
of
doing
good
whereas
i
am
after
a
vicissitude
of
disappointments
dangers
and
fatigues
reduced
to
misery
and
shame
aggravated
by
a
conscience
loaded
with
treachery
and
guilt
i
have
abused
the
confidence
and
generosity
of
my
patron
i
have
defrauded
his
family
under
the
mask
of
sincerity
and
attachment
i
have
taken
the
most
cruel
and
base
advantages
of
virtue
in
distress
i
have
seduced
unsuspecting
innocence
to
ruin
and
despair
i
have
violated
the
most
sacred
trust
reposed
in
me
by
my
friend
and
benefactor
i
have
betrayed
his
love
torn
his
noble
heart
asunder
by
means
of
the
most
perfidious
slander
and
false
insinuations
and
finally
brought
to
an
untimely
grave
the
fairest
pattern
of
human
beauty
and
perfection
shall
the
author
of
these
crimes
pass
with
impunity
shall
he
hope
to
prosper
in
the
midst
of
such
enormous
guilt
it
were
an
imputation
upon
providence
to
suppose
it
ah
no
i
begin
to
feel
myself
overtaken
by
the
eternal
justice
of
heaven
i
totter
on
the
edge
of
wretchedness
and
woe
without
one
friendly
hand
to
save
me
from
the
terrible
abyss
these
reflections
which
perhaps
the
misery
of
his
would
never
have
inspired
had
he
himself
remained
without
the
verge
of
misfortune
were
now
produced
from
the
sensation
of
his
own
calamities
and
for
the
first
time
his
cheeks
were
bedewed
with
the
drops
of

contraries
saith
plato
are
productive
of
each
other
reformation
is
oftentimes
generated
from
unsuccessful
vice
and
our
adventurer
was
at
this
juncture
very
well
disposed
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
in
consequence
of
those
salutary
suggestions
though
he
was
far
from
being
cured
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
on
the
contrary
all
the
faculties
of
his
soul
were
so
well
adapted
and
had
been
so
long
habituated
to
deceit
that
in
order
to
extricate
himself
from
the
evils
that
environed
him
he
would
not
in
all
probability
have
scrupled
to
practise
it
upon
his
own
father
had
a
convenient
opportunity
occurred
be
that
as
it
may
he
certainly
after
a
tedious
and
fruitless
exercise
of
his
invention
resolved
to
effect
a
clandestine
retreat
from
that
confederacy
of
enemies
which
he
could
not
withstand
and
once
more
join
his
fortune
to
that
of
renaldo
whom
he
proposed
to
serve
for
the
future
with
fidelity
and
affection
thereby
endeavouring
to
atone
for
the
treachery
of
his
former
conduct
thus
determined
he
packed
up
his
necessaries
in
a
portmanteau
attempted
to
amuse
his
creditors
with
promises
of
speedy
payment
and
venturing
to
come
forth
in
the
dark
took
a
place
in
the
canterbury
after
having
converted
his
superfluities
into
ready
money
these
steps
were
not
taken
with
such
privacy
as
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
his
adversaries
for
although
he
had
been
cautious
enough
to
transport
himself
and
his
baggage
to
the
inn
on
sunday
evening
and
never
doubted
that
the
vehicle
which
set
out
at
four
on
monday
morning
would
convey
him
out
of
the
reach
of
his
creditors
before
they
could
possibly
obtain
a
writ
for
securing
his
person
they
had
actually
taken
such
precautions
as
frustrated
all
his
finesse
and
the
coach
being
stopped
in
the
borough
of
southwark
doctor
fathom
was
seized
by
virtue
of
a
warrant
obtained
on
a
criminal
indictment
and
was
forthwith
conducted
to
the
prison
of
the
bench
yet
not
before
he
had
by
his
pathetic
remonstrances
excited
the
compassion
and
even
drawn
tears
from
the
eyes
of
his
he
no
sooner
recollected
himself
from
the
shock
which
must
have
been
occasioned
by
this
sinister
incident
than
he
despatched
a
letter
to
his
the
counsellor
requesting
an
immediate
conference
in
which
he
promised
to
make
such
a
proposal
as
would
save
him
all
the
expense
of
a
lawsuit
and
trial
and
at
the
same
time
effectually
answer
all
the
purposes
of
both
he
was
accordingly
favoured
with
a
visit
from
the
lawyer
to
whom
after
the
most
solemn
protestations
of
his
own
innocence
he
declared
that
finding
himself
unable
to
wage
war
against
such
powerful
antagonists
he
had
resolved
even
to
abandon
his
indubitable
right
and
retire
into
another
country
in
order
to
screen
himself
from
persecution
and
remove
all
cause
of
disquiet
from
the
prosecutrix
when
he
was
unfortunately
prevented
by
the
warrant
which
had
been
executed
against
him
he
said
he
was
still
willing
for
the
sake
of
his
liberty
to
sign
a
formal
renunciation
of
his
pretensions
to
fathom
and
her
fortune
provided
the
deeds
could
be
executed
and
the
warrant
withdrawn
before
he
should
be
detained
by
his
other
creditors
and
lastly
he
conjured
the
barrister
to
spare
himself
the
guilt
and
the
charge
of
suborning
evidence
for
the
destruction
of
an
unhappy
man
whose
misfortune
was
his
only
fault
the
lawyer
felt
the
force
of
his
expostulations
and
though
he
would
by
no
means
suppose
him
innocent
of
the
charge
of
bigamy
yet
under
the
pretext
of
humanity
and
commiseration
he
undertook
to
persuade
his
sister
to
accept
of
a
proper
release
which
he
observed
would
not
be
binding
if
executed
during
the
confinement
of
fathom
he
therefore
took
his
leave
in
order
to
prepare
the
papers
withdraw
the
action
and
take
such
other
measures
as
would
hinder
the
prisoner
from
giving
him
the
slip
next
day
he
returned
with
an
order
to
release
our
hero
who
being
formally
discharged
was
conducted
by
the
lawyer
to
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
where
the
releases
were
exchanged
and
everything
concluded
with
amity
and
concord
this
business
being
happily
transacted
fathom
stept
into
a
with
his
baggage
and
was
followed
by
a
bailiff
who
told
him
with
great
composure
that
he
was
again
a
prisoner
at
the
suit
of
doctor
buffalo
and
desired
the
coachman
to
reconduct
him
to
the
lodging
he
had
so
lately
discharged
fathom
whose
fortitude
had
been
hitherto
of
the
pagan
temper
was
now
fain
to
reinforce
it
with
the
philosophy
of
christian
resignation
though
he
had
not
as
yet
arrived
to
such
a
pitch
of
as
to
forgive
the
counsellor
to
whose
double
dealing
he
imputed
this
new
calamity
after
having
received
the
compliments
of
the
jailer
on
his
recommitment
he
took
pen
ink
and
paper
and
composed
an
artful
and
affecting
epistle
to
the
empiric
imploring
his
mercy
flattering
his
weakness
and
demonstrating
the
bad
policy
of
cooping
up
an
unhappy
man
in
a
jail
where
he
could
never
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
justice
to
his
creditors
nor
did
he
forget
to
declare
his
intention
of
retiring
into
another
country
where
he
might
have
some
chance
of
earning
a
subsistence
which
he
had
so
long
toiled
for
to
no
purpose
in
england
this
last
declaration
he
made
in
consequence
of
the
jealous
disposition
of
the
quack
who
he
knew
had
long
looked
upon
him
in
the
odious
light
of
an
interloping
rival
however
he
reaped
no
benefit
from
this
supplication
which
served
only
to
gratify
the
pride
of
buffalo
who
produced
the
extravagant
encomiums
which
fathom
had
bestowed
upon
him
as
so
many
testimonials
of
his
foe
bearing
witness
to
his
virtue
chapter
fathom
being
safely
housed
the
reader
is
entertained
with
a
retrospect
but
now
it
is
high
time
to
leave
our
adventurer
to
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
and
remorse
in
this
solitary
mansion
that
we
may
trace
renaldo
in
the
several
steps
he
took
to
assert
his
right
and
do
justice
to
his
family
never
man
indulged
a
more
melancholy
train
of
ideas
than
that
which
accompanied
him
in
his
journey
to
the
imperial
court
for
notwithstanding
the
manifold
reasons
he
had
to
expect
a
happy
issue
to
his
aim
his
imagination
was
incessantly
infected
with
something
that
chilled
his
nerves
and
saddened
his
heart
recurring
with
quick
succession
like
the
unwearied
wave
that
beats
upon
the
bleak
inhospitable
greenland
shore
this
the
reader
will
easily
suppose
was
no
other
than
the
remembrance
of
the
forlorn
monimia
whose
image
appeared
to
his
fancy
in
different
attitudes
according
to
the
prevalence
of
the
passions
which
raged
in
his
bosom
sometimes
he
viewed
her
in
the
light
of
apostasy
and
then
his
soul
was
maddened
with
indignation
and
despair
but
these
transitory
blasts
were
not
able
to
efface
the
impressions
she
had
formerly
made
upon
his
heart
impressions
which
he
had
so
often
and
so
long
contemplated
with
inconceivable
rapture
these
pictures
still
remained
representing
her
fair
as
the
most
perfect
idea
of
beauty
soft
and
tender
as
an
angel
of
mercy
and
compassion
warmed
with
every
virtue
of
the
heart
and
adorned
with
every
accomplishment
of
human
nature
yet
the
alarming
contrast
came
still
in
the
rear
of
this
recollection
so
that
his
soul
was
by
turns
agitated
by
the
tempests
of
horror
and
overwhelmed
by
the
floods
of
grief
he
recalled
the
moment
on
which
he
first
beheld
her
with
that
pleasing
regret
which
attends
the
memory
of
a
dear
deceased
friend
then
he
bitterly
cursed
it
as
the
source
of
all
his
misfortunes
and
affliction
he
thanked
heaven
for
having
blessed
him
with
a
friend
to
detect
her
perfidy
and
ingratitude
and
then
ardently
wished
he
had
still
continued
under
the
influence
of
her
delusion
in
a
word
the
loneliness
of
his
situation
aggravated
every
horror
of
his
reflection
for
as
he
found
himself
without
company
his
imagination
was
never
solicited
or
his
attention
diverted
from
these
subjects
of
woe
and
he
travelled
to
brussels
in
a
reverie
fraught
with
such
torments
as
must
have
entirely
wrecked
his
reason
had
not
providence
interposed
in
his
behalf
he
was
by
his
postillion
conducted
to
one
of
the
best
inns
of
the
place
where
he
understood
the
cloth
was
already
laid
for
supper
and
as
the
ordinary
is
open
to
strangers
in
all
these
houses
of
entertainment
he
introduced
himself
into
the
company
with
a
view
to
alleviate
in
some
measure
his
sorrow
and
chagrin
by
the
conversation
of
his
yet
he
was
so
ill
prepared
to
obtain
the
relief
which
he
courted
that
he
entered
the
apartment
and
sat
down
to
table
without
distinguishing
either
the
number
or
countenances
of
those
who
were
present
though
he
himself
did
not
long
remain
so
unregarded
his
mien
and
deportment
produced
a
prepossession
in
his
favour
and
the
air
of
affliction
so
remarkable
in
his
visage
did
not
fail
to
attract
their
sympathy
and
observation
among
the
rest
was
an
irish
officer
in
the
austrian
service
who
having
eyed
renaldo
attentively
sir
said
he
rising
if
my
eyes
and
memory
do
not
deceive
me
you
are
the
count
de
melvil
with
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
serve
upon
the
rhine
during
the
last
war
the
youth
hearing
his
own
name
mentioned
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
at
once
recognising
the
other
to
be
a
gentleman
who
had
been
a
captain
in
his
father
regiment
ran
forwards
and
embraced
him
with
great
affection
this
was
in
divers
respects
a
fortunate
rencontre
for
young
melvil
as
the
officer
was
not
only
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
situation
of
the
count
family
but
also
resolved
in
a
few
days
to
set
out
for
vienna
whither
he
promised
to
accompany
renaldo
as
soon
as
he
understood
his
route
lay
the
same
way
before
the
day
fixed
for
their
departure
arrived
this
gentleman
found
means
to
insinuate
himself
so
far
into
the
confidence
of
the
count
as
to
learn
the
cause
of
that
distress
which
he
had
observed
in
his
features
at
their
first
meeting
and
being
a
gentleman
of
uncommon
vivacity
as
well
as
sincerely
attached
to
the
family
of
melvil
to
which
he
had
owed
his
promotion
he
exerted
all
his
and
good
sense
in
amusing
the
fancy
and
reasoning
down
the
mortification
of
the
afflicted
hungarian
he
in
particular
endeavoured
to
wean
his
attention
from
the
lost
monimia
by
engaging
it
upon
his
domestic
affairs
and
upon
the
wrongs
of
his
mother
and
sister
who
he
gave
him
to
understand
were
languishing
under
the
tyranny
of
his
this
was
a
note
that
effectually
roused
him
from
the
lethargy
of
his
sorrow
and
the
desire
of
taking
vengeance
on
the
oppressor
who
had
ruined
his
fortune
and
made
his
nearest
relations
miserable
so
entirely
engrossed
his
thoughts
as
to
leave
no
room
for
other
considerations
during
their
journey
to
austria
major
farrel
that
was
the
name
of
his
informed
him
of
many
circumstances
touching
his
father
house
to
which
himself
was
an
utter
stranger
the
conduct
of
your
mother
said
he
in
marrying
count
trebasi
was
not
at
all
agreeable
either
to
the
friends
of
the
count
de
melvil
or
to
her
own
relations
who
knew
her
second
husband
to
be
a
man
of
a
violent
temper
and
rapacious
disposition
which
the
nature
of
his
education
and
employment
had
served
rather
to
inflame
than
allay
for
you
well
know
he
was
a
partisan
during
the
whole
course
of
the
late
war
they
were
moreover
equally
surprised
and
chagrined
when
they
found
she
took
no
step
to
prevent
his
seizing
upon
that
inheritance
which
of
right
belonged
to
you
and
which
by
the
laws
of
hungary
is
unalienable
from
the
heir
of
blood
nevertheless
they
are
now
fully
convinced
that
she
hath
more
than
sufficiently
atoned
for
her
indiscretion
by
the
barbarity
of
her
husband
who
hath
not
only
secluded
her
from
all
communication
with
her
friends
and
acquaintance
but
even
confined
her
to
the
west
tower
of
your
father
house
where
she
is
said
to
be
kept
close
prisoner
and
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
inconvenience
and
mortification
this
severity
she
is
believed
to
have
incurred
in
consequence
of
having
expostulated
to
him
upon
his
unjust
behaviour
to
you
and
mademoiselle
whom
he
hath
actually
shut
up
in
some
convent
in
vienna
which
your
relations
have
not
as
yet
been
able
to
discover
but
the
memory
of
your
noble
father
is
so
dear
to
all
those
who
were
favoured
with
his
friendship
and
the
sufferings
of
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
have
raised
such
a
spirit
of
resentment
against
her
cruel
jailor
that
nothing
is
wanted
but
your
presence
to
begin
the
prosecution
and
give
a
sanction
to
the
measures
of
your
friends
which
will
in
a
little
time
restore
your
family
to
the
fruition
of
its
rights
and
fortune
for
my
own
part
my
dear
count
i
consider
myself
as
one
wholly
indebted
to
your
house
for
the
rank
and
expectation
i
now
enjoy
and
my
finances
interest
and
person
such
as
they
are
i
dedicate
to
your
service
renaldo
was
not
slow
in
making
his
acknowledgments
to
this
generous
hibernian
whom
he
informed
of
his
scheme
recounting
to
him
his
uncommon
transaction
with
the
benevolent
jew
and
communicating
the
letters
of
recommendation
he
had
received
by
his
means
to
some
of
the
first
noblemen
at
the
imperial
court
meanwhile
he
burned
with
impatience
to
chastise
count
trebasi
for
his
perfidious
conduct
to
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
would
have
taken
the
road
to
presburg
without
touching
at
vienna
in
order
to
call
him
to
a
severe
account
had
not
he
been
strenuously
opposed
by
major
farrel
who
represented
the
imprudence
of
taking
such
a
step
before
he
had
secured
a
proper
protection
from
the
consequences
with
which
it
might
be
attended
it
is
not
said
he
your
own
life
and
fortune
only
which
depend
upon
your
behaviour
in
this
emergency
but
also
the
quiet
and
happiness
of
those
who
are
most
dear
to
your
affection
not
you
alone
but
likewise
your
mother
and
sister
would
infallibly
suffer
by
your
temerity
and
precipitation
first
of
all
deliver
your
credentials
at
court
and
let
us
join
our
endeavours
to
raise
an
interest
strong
enough
to
counterbalance
that
of
trebasi
if
we
succeed
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
having
recourse
to
personal
measures
he
will
be
compelled
to
yield
up
your
inheritance
which
he
unjustly
detains
and
to
restore
your
sister
to
your
arms
and
if
he
afterwards
refuses
to
do
justice
to
the
countess
you
will
always
have
it
in
your
power
to
evince
yourself
the
son
of
the
brave
count
de
melvil
these
just
and
salutary
representations
had
a
due
effect
upon
renaldo
who
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
capital
of
austria
than
he
waited
upon
a
certain
prince
of
distinction
to
whose
patronage
he
was
commended
and
from
whom
he
met
with
a
very
cordial
reception
not
only
on
account
of
his
credentials
but
also
for
the
sake
of
his
father
who
was
well
known
to
his
highness
he
heard
his
complaints
with
great
patience
and
affability
assured
him
of
his
assistance
and
protection
and
even
undertook
to
introduce
him
to
the
who
would
not
suffer
the
weakest
of
her
subjects
to
be
oppressed
much
less
disregard
the
cause
of
an
injured
young
nobleman
who
by
his
own
services
and
those
of
his
family
was
peculiarly
entitled
to
her
favour
nor
was
he
the
only
person
whose
countenance
and
patronage
melvil
solicited
upon
this
occasion
he
visited
all
the
friends
of
his
father
and
all
his
mother
relations
who
were
easily
interested
in
his
behalf
while
major
farrel
contributed
all
his
efforts
in
strengthening
the
association
so
that
a
lawsuit
was
immediately
commenced
against
count
trebasi
who
on
his
side
was
not
idle
but
prepared
with
incredible
industry
for
the
assault
resolving
to
maintain
with
his
whole
power
the
acquisition
he
had
made
the
laws
of
hungary
like
those
of
some
other
countries
i
could
name
afford
so
many
subterfuges
for
the
purposes
of
perfidy
and
fraud
that
it
is
no
wonder
our
youth
began
to
complain
of
the
slow
progress
of
his
affair
especially
as
he
glowed
with
the
most
eager
desire
of
redressing
the
grievances
of
his
parent
and
sister
whose
sufferings
he
did
not
doubt
were
doubled
since
the
institution
of
his
process
against
their
tormentor
he
imparted
his
sentiments
on
this
head
to
his
friend
and
as
his
apprehensions
every
moment
increased
plainly
told
him
he
could
no
longer
live
without
making
some
effort
to
see
those
with
whom
he
was
so
nearly
connected
in
point
of
blood
and
affection
he
therefore
resolved
to
repair
immediately
to
presburg
and
according
to
the
intelligence
he
should
procure
essay
to
see
and
converse
with
his
mother
though
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
chapter
renaldo
abridges
the
proceedings
at
law
and
approves
himself
the
son
of
his
father
the
major
finding
him
determined
insisted
upon
attending
him
in
this
expedition
and
they
set
out
together
for
presburg
where
they
privately
arrived
in
the
dark
resolving
to
keep
themselves
concealed
at
the
house
of
a
friend
until
they
should
have
formed
some
plan
for
their
future
operations
here
they
were
informed
that
count
trebasi
castle
was
altogether
inaccessible
that
all
the
servants
who
were
supposed
to
have
the
least
veneration
or
compassion
for
the
countess
were
dismissed
and
that
since
renaldo
was
known
to
be
in
germany
the
vigilance
and
caution
of
that
cruel
husband
was
redoubled
to
such
a
degree
that
nobody
knew
whether
his
unfortunate
lady
was
actually
alive
or
dead
farrel
perceiving
melvil
exceedingly
affected
with
this
intimation
and
hearing
him
declare
that
he
would
never
quit
presburg
until
he
should
have
entered
the
house
and
removed
his
doubts
on
that
interesting
subject
not
only
argued
with
great
vehemence
against
such
an
attempt
as
equally
dangerous
and
indiscreet
but
solemnly
swore
he
would
prevent
his
purpose
by
discovering
his
design
to
the
family
unless
he
would
promise
to
listen
to
a
more
moderate
and
feasible
expedient
he
then
proposed
that
he
himself
should
appear
in
the
equipage
of
one
of
the
travelling
savoyards
who
stroll
about
europe
amusing
ignorant
people
with
the
effects
of
a
magic
lanthorn
and
in
that
disguise
endeavour
to
obtain
admittance
from
the
servants
of
trebasi
among
whom
he
might
make
such
inquiries
as
would
deliver
melvil
from
his
present
uneasy
suspense
this
proposal
was
embraced
though
reluctantly
by
renaldo
who
was
unwilling
to
expose
his
friend
to
the
least
danger
or
disgrace
and
the
major
being
next
day
provided
with
the
habit
and
implements
of
his
new
profession
together
with
a
ragged
attendant
who
preceded
him
extorting
music
from
a
paltry
viol
approached
the
castle
gate
and
proclaimed
his
show
so
naturally
in
a
yell
partaking
of
the
scream
of
savoy
and
the
howl
of
ireland
that
one
would
have
imagined
he
had
been
conductor
to
madam
catherina
from
his
cradle
so
far
his
stratagem
succeeded
he
had
not
long
stood
in
waiting
before
he
was
invited
into
the
where
the
servants
formed
a
ring
and
danced
to
the
efforts
of
his
companion
skill
then
he
was
conducted
into
the
buttery
where
he
exhibited
his
figures
on
the
wall
and
his
princess
on
the
floor
and
while
they
regaled
him
in
this
manner
with
scraps
and
sour
wine
he
took
occasion
to
inquire
about
the
old
lady
and
her
daughter
before
whom
he
said
he
had
performed
in
his
last
peregrination
though
this
question
was
asked
with
all
that
air
of
simplicity
which
is
peculiar
to
these
people
one
of
the
domestics
took
the
alarm
being
infected
with
the
suspicions
of
his
master
and
plainly
taxed
the
major
with
being
a
spy
threatening
at
the
same
time
that
he
should
be
stripped
and
searched
this
would
have
been
a
very
dangerous
experiment
for
the
hibernian
who
had
actually
in
his
pocket
a
letter
to
the
countess
from
her
son
which
he
hoped
fortune
might
have
furnished
him
with
an
opportunity
to
deliver
when
he
therefore
found
himself
in
this
dilemma
he
was
not
at
all
easy
in
his
own
mind
however
instead
of
protesting
his
innocence
in
an
humble
and
beseeching
strain
in
order
to
acquit
himself
of
the
charge
he
resolved
to
elude
the
suspicion
by
provoking
the
wrath
of
his
accuser
and
putting
on
the
air
of
vulgar
integrity
affronted
began
to
reproach
the
servant
in
very
insolent
terms
for
his
unfair
supposition
and
undressed
himself
in
a
moment
to
the
skin
threw
his
tattered
garments
in
the
face
of
his
adversary
telling
him
he
would
find
nothing
there
which
he
would
not
be
very
glad
to
part
with
at
the
same
time
raising
his
voice
he
in
the
gibberish
of
the
clan
he
represented
scolded
and
cursed
with
great
fluency
so
that
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
noise
the
valet
jealousy
like
a
smaller
fire
was
in
a
trice
swallowed
up
in
the
greater
flame
of
his
rage
enkindled
by
this
abrupt
address
in
consequence
of
which
farrel
was
kicked
out
at
the
gate
naked
as
he
was
to
the
waist
after
his
lanthorn
had
been
broke
to
pieces
on
his
head
and
there
he
was
joined
by
his
domestic
who
had
not
been
able
to
recover
his
apparel
and
effect
a
retreat
without
incurring
marks
of
the
same
sort
of
distinction
the
major
considering
the
risk
he
must
have
run
in
being
detected
thought
himself
cheaply
quit
for
this
moderate
discipline
though
he
was
really
concerned
for
his
friend
renaldo
who
understanding
the
particulars
of
the
adventure
determined
as
the
last
effort
to
ride
round
the
castle
in
the
open
day
on
pretence
of
taking
the
air
when
peradventure
the
countess
would
see
him
from
the
place
of
her
confinement
and
favour
him
with
some
mark
or
token
of
her
being
alive
though
his
companion
did
not
much
relish
this
plan
which
he
foresaw
would
expose
him
to
the
insults
of
trebasi
yet
as
he
could
not
contrive
a
better
he
acquiesced
in
renaldo
invention
with
the
proviso
that
he
would
defer
the
execution
of
it
until
his
should
be
absent
in
the
chase
which
was
a
diversion
he
every
day
enjoyed
accordingly
they
set
a
proper
watch
and
lay
concealed
until
they
were
informed
of
trebasi
having
gone
forth
when
they
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
having
made
a
small
excursion
in
the
adjoining
fields
they
drew
nearer
the
walls
and
at
an
easy
pace
had
twice
circled
them
when
farrel
descried
at
the
top
of
a
tower
a
white
handkerchief
waved
by
a
woman
hand
through
the
iron
bars
that
secured
the
window
this
signal
being
pointed
out
to
renaldo
his
heart
began
to
throb
with
great
violence
he
made
a
respectful
obeisance
towards
the
part
in
which
it
appeared
and
perceiving
the
hand
beckoning
him
to
approach
advanced
to
the
very
buttress
of
the
turret
upon
which
seeing
something
drop
he
alighted
with
great
expedition
and
took
up
a
picture
of
his
father
in
miniature
the
features
of
which
he
no
sooner
distinguished
than
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
he
pressed
the
little
image
to
his
lips
with
the
most
filial
fervour
then
conveying
it
to
his
bosom
looked
up
to
the
hand
which
waved
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
him
to
understand
it
was
high
time
to
retire
being
by
this
time
highly
persuaded
that
his
kind
monitor
was
no
other
than
the
countess
herself
he
pointed
to
his
heart
in
token
of
his
filial
affection
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
sword
to
denote
his
resolution
of
doing
her
justice
he
took
his
leave
with
another
profound
bow
and
suffered
himself
to
be
reconducted
to
his
lodging
every
circumstance
of
this
transaction
was
observed
by
the
servants
of
count
trebasi
who
immediately
despatched
a
messenger
to
their
lord
with
an
account
of
what
had
happened
alarmed
at
this
information
from
which
he
immediately
concluded
that
the
stranger
was
young
melvil
he
forthwith
quitted
the
chase
and
returning
to
the
castle
by
a
private
postern
ordered
his
horse
to
be
kept
ready
saddled
in
hope
that
his
would
repeat
the
visit
to
his
mother
this
precaution
would
have
been
to
no
purpose
had
renaldo
followed
the
advice
of
farrel
who
represented
the
danger
of
returning
to
a
place
where
the
alarm
was
undoubtedly
given
by
his
first
appearance
and
exhorted
him
to
return
to
vienna
for
the
prosecution
of
his
suit
now
that
he
was
satisfied
of
his
mother
being
alive
in
order
to
strengthen
this
admonition
he
bade
him
recollect
the
signal
for
withdrawing
which
was
doubtless
the
effect
of
maternal
concern
inspired
by
the
knowledge
of
the
count
vigilance
and
vindictive
disposition
notwithstanding
these
suggestions
melvil
persisted
in
his
resolution
of
appearing
once
more
below
the
tower
on
the
supposition
that
his
mother
in
expectation
of
his
return
had
prepared
a
billet
for
his
acceptance
from
which
he
might
obtain
important
intelligence
the
major
seeing
him
lend
a
deaf
ear
to
his
remonstrances
was
contented
to
attend
him
in
his
second
expedition
which
he
pressed
him
to
undertake
that
same
afternoon
as
trebasi
had
taken
care
to
circulate
a
report
of
his
having
gone
to
dine
at
the
seat
of
a
nobleman
in
the
neighbourhood
our
and
his
squire
deceived
by
this
finesse
presented
themselves
again
under
the
prison
of
the
countess
who
no
sooner
beheld
her
son
return
than
she
earnestly
entreated
him
to
be
gone
by
the
same
sign
which
she
had
before
used
and
he
taking
it
for
granted
that
she
was
debarred
the
use
of
pen
ink
and
paper
and
that
she
had
nothing
more
to
expect
consented
to
retire
and
had
already
moved
to
some
distance
from
the
house
when
in
crossing
a
small
plantation
that
belonged
to
the
castle
they
were
met
by
count
trebasi
and
another
person
on
horseback
at
sight
of
this
apparition
the
blood
mounted
into
renaldo
cheeks
and
his
eyes
began
to
lighten
with
eagerness
and
indignation
which
was
not
at
all
diminished
by
the
ferocious
address
of
the
count
who
advancing
to
melvil
with
a
menacing
air
before
you
proceed
said
he
i
must
know
with
what
view
you
have
been
twice
patroling
round
my
enclosures
and
reconnoitring
the
different
avenues
of
my
house
you
likewise
carry
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
with
some
person
in
the
family
of
which
my
honour
obliges
me
to
demand
an
explanation
had
your
actions
been
always
regulated
by
the
dictates
of
honour
replied
renaldo
i
should
never
have
been
questioned
for
riding
round
that
castle
which
you
know
is
my
rightful
inheritance
or
excluded
from
the
sight
of
a
parent
who
suffers
under
your
tyranny
and
oppression
it
is
my
part
therefore
to
expostulate
and
since
fortune
hath
favoured
me
with
an
opportunity
of
revenging
our
wrongs
in
person
we
shall
not
part
until
you
have
learned
that
the
family
of
the
count
de
melvil
is
not
to
be
injured
with
impunity
here
is
no
advantage
on
either
side
in
point
of
arms
or
number
you
are
better
mounted
than
i
am
and
shall
have
the
choice
of
the
ground
on
which
our
difference
ought
to
be
brought
to
a
speedy
determination
trebasi
whose
courage
was
not
of
the
sentimental
kind
but
purely
owing
to
his
natural
insensibility
of
danger
instead
of
concerting
measures
coolly
for
the
engagement
or
making
any
verbal
reply
to
this
defiance
drew
a
pistol
without
the
least
hesitation
and
fired
it
at
the
face
of
renaldo
part
of
whose
left
eyebrow
was
carried
off
by
the
ball
melvil
was
not
slow
in
returning
the
compliment
which
as
it
was
deliberate
proved
the
more
decisive
for
the
shot
entering
the
count
right
breast
made
its
way
to
the
backbone
with
such
a
shock
as
struck
him
to
the
ground
upon
which
the
other
alighted
in
order
to
improve
the
advantage
he
had
gained
during
this
transaction
farrel
had
lost
his
life
by
the
savage
behaviour
of
trebasi
attendant
who
had
been
a
hussar
officer
and
who
thinking
it
was
his
duty
to
imitate
the
example
of
his
patron
on
this
occasion
discharged
a
pistol
at
the
major
before
he
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
the
hibernian
horse
being
a
common
hireling
and
unaccustomed
to
stand
fire
no
sooner
saw
the
flash
of
pistol
than
starting
aside
he
happened
to
plunge
into
a
hole
and
was
overturned
at
the
very
instant
when
the
hussar
piece
went
off
so
that
no
damage
ensued
to
his
rider
who
pitching
on
his
feet
flew
with
great
nimbleness
to
his
adversary
then
laying
hold
on
one
leg
dismounted
him
in
a
twinkling
and
seizing
his
throat
as
he
lay
would
have
soon
despatched
him
without
the
use
of
firearms
had
he
not
been
prevented
by
his
friend
renaldo
who
desired
him
to
desist
observing
that
his
vengeance
was
already
satisfied
as
the
count
seemed
to
be
in
the
agonies
of
death
the
major
was
loth
to
quit
his
prey
as
he
thought
his
aggressor
had
acted
in
a
treacherous
manner
but
recollecting
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
because
in
all
probability
the
firing
had
alarmed
the
castle
he
took
his
leave
of
the
vanquished
hussar
with
a
couple
of
hearty
kicks
and
mounting
his
horse
followed
melvil
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
who
was
kinsman
to
the
countess
and
very
well
disposed
to
grant
him
a
secure
retreat
until
the
troublesome
consequences
of
this
rencontre
should
be
overblown
trebasi
though
to
the
young
gentleman
he
seemed
speechless
and
insensible
had
neither
lost
the
use
of
his
reason
nor
of
his
tongue
but
affected
that
extremity
in
order
to
avoid
any
further
conversation
with
the
victor
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
never
think
of
death
until
he
knocks
at
the
door
and
then
earnestly
entreat
him
to
excuse
them
for
the
present
and
be
so
good
as
to
call
another
time
the
count
had
so
often
escaped
unhurt
in
the
course
of
his
campaigns
that
he
looked
upon
himself
as
invulnerable
and
set
all
danger
at
defiance
though
he
had
hitherto
taken
no
care
of
the
concerns
of
his
soul
he
had
a
large
fund
of
superstition
at
bottom
and
when
the
surgeon
who
examined
his
wound
declared
it
was
mortal
all
the
terrors
of
futurity
took
hold
on
his
imagination
all
the
misdemeanours
of
his
life
presented
themselves
in
aggravated
colours
to
his
recollection
he
implored
the
spiritual
assistance
of
a
good
priest
in
the
neighbourhood
who
in
the
discharge
of
his
own
conscience
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
little
mercy
to
expect
unless
he
would
as
much
as
lay
in
his
power
redress
the
injuries
he
had
done
to
his
as
nothing
lay
heavier
upon
his
soul
than
the
cruelty
and
fraud
he
had
practised
upon
the
family
of
count
melvil
he
earnestly
besought
this
charitable
clergyman
to
mediate
his
pardon
with
the
countess
and
at
the
same
time
desired
to
see
renaldo
before
his
death
that
he
might
put
him
in
possession
of
his
paternal
estate
and
solicit
his
forgiveness
for
the
offence
he
had
given
his
lady
far
from
waiting
for
the
priest
intercession
no
sooner
understood
the
lamentable
situation
of
her
husband
and
found
herself
at
liberty
than
she
hastened
to
his
apartment
expressed
the
utmost
concern
for
his
misfortune
and
tended
him
with
truly
conjugal
tenderness
and
fidelity
her
son
gladly
obeyed
the
summons
and
was
received
with
great
civility
and
satisfaction
by
his
who
in
presence
of
the
judge
and
divers
gentlemen
assembled
for
that
purpose
renounced
all
right
and
title
to
the
fortune
he
had
so
unjustly
usurped
disclosed
the
name
of
the
convent
to
which
mademoiselle
de
melvil
had
been
conveyed
dismissed
all
the
agents
of
his
iniquity
and
being
reconciled
to
his
began
to
prepare
himself
in
tranquillity
for
his
latter
end
the
countess
was
overwhelmed
with
an
excess
of
joy
while
she
embraced
her
son
who
had
proved
himself
so
worthy
of
his
father
yet
this
joy
was
embittered
by
reflecting
that
she
was
made
a
widow
by
the
hands
of
that
darling
son
for
though
she
knew
his
honour
demanded
the
sacrifice
she
could
not
lay
aside
that
regard
and
veneration
which
is
attached
to
the
name
of
husband
and
therefore
resolved
to
retire
into
a
monastery
where
she
could
spend
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
devotion
without
being
exposed
to
any
intercourse
which
might
interfere
with
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiments
on
that
subject
chapter
he
is
the
messenger
of
happiness
to
his
sister
who
removes
the
film
which
had
long
obstructed
his
penetration
with
regard
to
count
fathom
as
the
most
endearing
affection
had
always
subsisted
between
renaldo
and
his
sister
he
would
not
one
moment
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
flying
to
her
embrace
and
of
being
the
glad
messenger
of
her
deliverance
soon
therefore
as
he
understood
the
place
of
her
retreat
and
had
obtained
a
proper
order
to
the
abbess
signed
by
count
trebasi
he
set
out
post
for
vienna
still
accompanied
by
his
faithful
hibernian
and
arriving
at
the
convent
found
the
abbess
and
the
whole
house
so
engrossed
in
making
preparations
for
the
ceremony
of
giving
the
veil
next
day
to
a
young
woman
who
had
fulfilled
the
term
of
her
probation
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
his
sister
with
that
leisure
and
satisfaction
which
he
had
flattered
himself
with
enjoying
at
this
meeting
and
therefore
he
was
fain
to
bridle
his
impatience
for
two
days
and
keep
his
credentials
until
the
hurry
should
be
over
that
mademoiselle
might
have
no
intimation
of
her
good
fortune
except
from
his
own
mouth
in
order
to
fill
up
this
tedious
interval
he
visited
his
friends
at
court
who
were
rejoiced
to
hear
the
happy
issue
of
his
excursion
to
presburg
the
prince
who
was
his
particular
patron
desired
he
would
make
himself
perfectly
easy
with
regard
to
the
death
of
count
trebasi
for
he
would
take
care
to
represent
him
in
such
a
light
to
the
as
would
screen
him
from
any
danger
or
prosecution
on
that
account
his
highness
moreover
appointed
the
following
day
for
performing
the
promise
he
had
made
of
presenting
him
to
that
august
princess
and
in
the
meantime
prepossessed
her
so
much
in
his
favour
that
when
he
approached
her
presence
and
was
announced
by
his
noble
introductor
she
eyed
him
with
a
look
of
peculiar
complacency
saying
i
am
glad
to
see
you
returned
to
my
dominions
your
father
was
a
gallant
officer
who
served
our
house
with
equal
courage
and
fidelity
and
as
i
understand
you
tread
in
his
footsteps
you
may
depend
upon
my
favour
and
protection
he
was
so
much
overwhelmed
with
this
gracious
reception
that
while
he
bowed
in
silence
the
drops
of
gratitude
trickled
from
his
eyes
and
her
imperial
majesty
was
so
well
pleased
with
this
manifestation
of
his
heart
that
she
immediately
gave
directions
for
promoting
him
to
the
command
of
a
troop
of
horse
thus
fortune
seemed
willing
and
indeed
eager
to
discharge
the
debt
she
owed
him
for
the
different
calamities
he
had
undergone
and
as
he
looked
upon
the
generous
hebrew
to
be
the
sole
source
of
his
success
he
did
not
fail
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
happy
effects
of
his
recommendation
and
friendship
and
to
express
in
the
warmest
terms
the
deep
sense
he
had
of
his
uncommon
benevolence
which
by
the
bye
was
still
greater
with
regard
to
renaldo
than
the
reader
as
yet
imagines
for
he
not
only
furnished
him
with
money
for
his
present
occasions
but
also
gave
him
an
unlimited
credit
on
a
banker
in
vienna
to
whom
one
of
his
letters
was
directed
the
ceremony
of
the
nun
admission
being
now
performed
and
the
convent
restored
to
its
former
quiet
melvil
hastened
thither
on
the
wings
of
brotherly
affection
and
presented
his
letter
to
the
abbess
who
having
perused
the
contents
by
which
she
learned
that
the
family
disquiets
of
count
trebasi
no
longer
subsisted
and
that
the
bearer
was
the
brother
of
mademoiselle
she
received
him
with
great
politeness
congratulated
him
on
this
happy
event
and
begging
he
would
excuse
her
staying
with
him
in
the
parlour
on
pretence
of
business
withdrew
saying
she
would
immediately
send
in
a
young
lady
who
would
console
him
for
her
absence
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
joined
by
his
sister
who
expecting
nothing
less
than
to
see
renaldo
no
sooner
distinguished
his
features
than
she
shrieked
aloud
with
surprise
and
would
have
sunk
upon
the
floor
had
not
he
supported
her
in
his
embrace
such
a
sudden
apparition
of
her
brother
at
any
time
or
in
any
place
after
their
long
separation
would
have
strongly
affected
this
sensible
young
lady
but
to
find
him
so
abruptly
in
a
place
where
she
thought
herself
buried
from
the
knowledge
of
all
her
relations
occasioned
such
commotions
in
her
spirits
as
had
endangered
her
reason
for
it
was
not
till
after
a
considerable
pause
that
she
could
talk
to
him
with
connexion
or
coherence
however
as
those
transports
subsided
they
entered
into
a
more
deliberate
and
agreeable
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
he
gradually
informed
her
of
what
had
passed
at
the
castle
and
inexpressible
was
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
learning
that
her
mother
was
released
from
captivity
herself
restored
to
freedom
and
her
brother
to
the
possession
of
his
inheritance
by
the
only
means
to
which
she
had
always
prayed
these
blessings
might
be
owing
as
she
had
been
treated
with
uncommon
humanity
by
the
abbess
she
would
not
consent
to
leave
the
convent
until
he
should
be
ready
to
set
out
for
presburg
so
that
they
dined
together
with
that
good
lady
and
passed
the
afternoon
in
that
mutual
communication
with
which
a
brother
and
sister
may
be
supposed
to
entertain
themselves
on
such
an
occasion
she
gave
him
a
detail
of
the
insults
and
mortifications
she
had
suffered
from
the
brutality
of
her
and
told
him
that
her
confinement
in
this
monastery
was
owing
to
trebasi
having
intercepted
a
letter
to
her
from
renaldo
signifying
his
intention
to
return
to
the
empire
in
order
to
assert
his
own
right
and
redress
his
grievances
then
turning
the
discourse
upon
the
incidents
of
his
peregrinations
she
in
a
particular
manner
inquired
about
that
exquisite
beauty
who
had
been
the
innocent
source
of
all
his
distresses
and
upon
whose
perfections
he
had
often
in
his
letters
to
his
sister
expatiated
with
indications
of
rapture
and
delight
this
inquiry
in
a
moment
blew
up
that
scorching
flame
which
had
been
stifled
by
other
necessary
avocations
his
eyes
gleamed
his
cheeks
glowed
and
grew
pale
alternately
and
his
whole
frame
underwent
an
immediate
agitation
which
being
perceived
by
mademoiselle
she
concluded
that
some
new
calamity
was
annexed
to
the
name
of
monimia
and
dreading
to
rip
up
a
wound
which
she
saw
was
so
ineffectually
closed
she
for
the
present
suppressed
her
curiosity
and
concern
and
industriously
endeavoured
to
introduce
some
less
affecting
subject
of
conversation
he
saw
her
aim
approved
of
her
discretion
and
joining
her
endeavours
expressed
his
surprise
at
her
having
omitted
to
signify
the
least
remembrance
of
her
old
favourite
fathom
whom
he
had
left
in
england
he
had
no
sooner
pronounced
this
name
than
she
suffered
some
confusion
in
her
turn
from
which
however
recollecting
herself
brother
said
she
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
that
wretch
who
is
altogether
unworthy
of
retaining
the
smallest
share
of
your
regard
astonished
and
indeed
angry
at
this
expression
which
he
considered
as
the
effect
of
malicious
misrepresentation
he
gently
chid
her
for
her
credulity
in
believing
the
envious
aspersion
of
some
person
who
repined
at
the
superior
virtue
of
fathom
whom
he
affirmed
to
be
an
honour
to
the
human
species
nothing
is
more
easy
replied
the
young
lady
than
to
impose
upon
a
person
who
being
himself
unconscious
of
guile
suspects
no
deceit
you
have
been
a
dupe
dear
brother
not
to
the
finesse
of
fathom
but
to
the
sincerity
of
your
own
heart
for
my
own
part
i
assume
no
honour
to
my
own
penetration
in
having
comprehended
the
villany
of
that
impostor
which
was
discovered
in
more
than
one
instance
by
accidents
i
could
not
possibly
foresee
you
must
know
that
teresa
who
attended
me
from
my
childhood
and
in
whose
honesty
i
reposed
such
confidence
having
disobliged
some
of
the
inferior
servants
was
so
narrowly
watched
in
all
her
transactions
as
to
be
at
last
detected
in
the
very
act
of
conveying
a
piece
of
plate
which
was
actually
found
concealed
among
her
clothes
you
may
guess
how
much
i
was
astonished
when
i
understood
this
circumstance
i
could
not
trust
to
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
and
should
have
still
believed
her
innocent
in
spite
of
ocular
demonstration
had
not
she
in
the
terrors
of
being
tried
for
felony
promised
to
make
a
very
material
discovery
to
the
countess
provided
she
would
take
such
measures
as
would
save
her
life
this
request
being
complied
with
she
in
my
hearing
opened
up
such
an
amazing
scene
of
iniquity
baseness
and
ingratitude
which
had
been
acted
by
her
and
fathom
in
order
to
defraud
the
family
to
which
they
were
so
much
indebted
that
i
could
not
have
believed
the
human
mind
capable
of
such
degeneracy
or
that
traitor
endowed
with
such
pernicious
cunning
and
dissimulation
had
not
her
tale
been
congruous
consistent
and
distinct
and
fraught
with
circumstances
that
left
no
room
to
doubt
the
least
article
of
her
confession
on
consideration
of
which
she
was
permitted
to
go
into
voluntary
exile
she
then
explained
their
combination
in
all
the
particulars
as
we
have
already
recounted
them
in
their
proper
place
and
finally
observed
that
the
opinion
she
had
hence
conceived
of
fathom
character
was
confirmed
by
what
she
had
since
learned
of
his
perfidious
conduct
towards
that
very
nun
who
had
lately
taken
the
veil
perceiving
her
brother
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
and
gaping
with
the
most
eager
attention
she
proceeded
to
relate
the
incidents
of
his
double
intrigue
with
the
jeweller
wife
and
daughter
as
they
were
communicated
to
her
by
the
nun
who
was
no
other
than
the
individual
wilhelmina
after
those
rivals
had
been
forsaken
by
their
gallant
their
mutual
animosities
and
chagrin
served
to
whet
the
attention
and
invention
of
each
so
that
in
a
little
time
the
whole
mystery
stood
disclosed
to
both
the
mother
had
discovered
the
daughter
correspondence
with
fathom
as
we
have
formerly
observed
by
means
of
that
unfortunate
letter
which
he
unwittingly
committed
to
the
charge
of
the
old
beldame
and
as
soon
as
she
understood
he
was
without
the
reach
of
all
solicitation
or
prosecution
imparted
this
billet
to
her
husband
whose
fury
was
so
ungovernable
that
he
had
almost
sacrificed
wilhelmina
with
his
own
hands
especially
when
terrified
by
his
threats
and
imprecations
she
owned
that
she
had
bestowed
the
chain
on
this
perfidious
lover
however
this
dreadful
purpose
was
prevented
partly
by
the
interposition
of
his
wife
whose
aim
was
not
the
death
but
immurement
of
his
daughter
and
partly
by
the
tears
and
supplication
of
the
young
gentlewoman
herself
who
protested
that
although
the
ceremony
of
the
church
had
not
been
performed
she
was
contracted
to
fathom
by
the
most
solemn
vows
to
witness
which
he
invoked
all
the
saints
in
heaven
the
jeweller
upon
cooler
consideration
was
unwilling
to
lose
the
last
spark
of
hope
that
glittered
among
the
ruins
of
his
despair
and
resisted
all
the
importunities
of
his
wife
who
pressed
him
to
consult
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
soul
in
the
fond
expectation
of
finding
some
expedient
to
lure
back
the
chain
and
its
possessor
in
the
meantime
wilhelmina
was
daily
and
hourly
exposed
to
the
mortifying
animadversions
of
her
mamma
who
with
all
the
insolence
of
virtue
incessantly
upbraided
her
with
the
backslidings
of
her
vicious
life
and
exhorted
her
to
reformation
and
repentance
this
continual
triumph
lasted
for
many
months
till
at
length
a
quarrel
happening
between
the
mother
and
the
gossip
at
whose
house
she
used
to
give
the
rendezvous
to
her
admirers
that
incensed
confidante
in
the
precipitation
of
her
anger
promulgated
the
history
of
those
secret
meetings
and
among
the
rest
her
interviews
with
fathom
were
brought
to
light
the
first
people
who
hear
news
of
this
sort
are
generally
those
to
whom
they
are
most
unwelcome
the
german
was
soon
apprised
of
his
frailty
and
considered
the
two
females
of
his
house
as
a
couple
of
devils
incarnate
sent
from
hell
to
exercise
his
patience
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
displeasure
he
found
matter
of
consolation
in
being
furnished
with
a
sufficient
reason
for
parting
with
his
helpmate
who
had
for
many
years
kept
his
family
in
disquiet
he
therefore
without
hazarding
a
personal
conference
sent
proposals
to
her
by
a
friend
which
she
did
not
think
proper
to
reject
and
seeing
himself
restored
to
the
dominion
of
his
own
house
exerted
his
sway
so
tyrannically
that
wilhelmina
became
weary
of
her
life
and
had
recourse
to
the
comforts
of
religion
of
which
she
soon
became
enamoured
and
begged
her
permission
to
dedicate
the
rest
of
her
life
to
the
duties
of
devotion
she
was
accordingly
received
in
this
convent
the
regulations
of
which
were
so
much
to
her
liking
that
she
performed
the
task
of
probation
with
pleasure
and
voluntarily
excluded
herself
from
the
vanities
of
this
life
it
was
here
she
had
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
mademoiselle
de
melvil
to
whom
she
communicated
her
complaints
of
fathom
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
related
to
the
count
as
he
himself
had
often
declared
while
the
young
lady
rehearsed
the
particulars
of
this
detail
renaldo
sustained
a
strange
vicissitude
of
different
passions
surprise
sorrow
fear
hope
and
indignation
raised
a
most
tumultuous
conflict
in
his
bosom
monimia
rushed
upon
his
imagination
in
the
character
of
innocence
betrayed
by
the
insinuations
of
treachery
he
with
horror
viewed
her
at
the
mercy
of
a
villain
who
had
broken
all
the
ties
of
gratitude
and
honour
affrighted
at
the
prospect
he
started
from
his
seat
exclaiming
in
the
most
unconnected
strain
of
distraction
and
despair
have
i
then
nourished
a
serpent
in
my
bosom
have
i
listened
to
the
voice
of
a
traitor
who
hath
murdered
my
peace
who
hath
torn
my
asunder
and
perhaps
ruined
the
pattern
of
all
earthly
perfection
it
can
not
be
heaven
would
not
suffer
such
infernal
artifice
to
take
effect
the
thunder
would
be
levelled
against
the
head
of
the
accursed
projector
from
this
transport
compared
with
his
agitation
when
he
mentioned
monimia
his
sister
judged
that
fathom
had
been
the
occasion
of
a
breach
between
the
two
lovers
and
this
conjecture
being
confirmed
by
the
disjointed
answers
he
made
to
her
interrogations
upon
the
affair
she
endeavoured
to
calm
his
apprehensions
by
representing
that
he
would
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
returning
to
england
where
the
misunderstanding
might
be
easily
cleared
up
and
that
in
the
meantime
he
had
nothing
to
fear
on
account
of
the
person
of
his
mistress
in
a
country
where
individuals
were
so
well
protected
by
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
realm
at
length
he
suffered
himself
to
be
flattered
with
the
fond
hope
of
seeing
monimia
character
triumph
in
the
inquiry
of
retrieving
that
lost
jewel
and
of
renewing
that
ravishing
intercourse
and
exalted
expectation
which
had
been
so
cruelly
cut
off
he
now
wished
to
find
fathom
as
black
as
he
had
been
exhibited
that
monimia
apostasy
might
be
numbered
among
the
misrepresentations
of
his
treachery
and
fraud
his
love
which
was
alike
generous
and
ardent
espoused
the
cause
and
he
no
longer
doubted
her
constancy
and
virtue
but
when
he
reflected
how
her
tender
heart
must
have
been
wrung
with
anguish
at
his
unkindness
and
cruelty
in
leaving
her
destitute
in
a
foreign
land
how
her
sensibility
must
have
been
tortured
in
finding
herself
altogether
dependent
upon
a
ruffian
who
certainly
harboured
the
most
baleful
designs
upon
her
honour
how
her
life
must
be
endangered
both
by
his
barbarity
and
her
own
despair
i
say
when
he
reflected
on
these
circumstances
he
shuddered
with
horror
and
dismay
and
that
very
night
despatched
a
letter
to
his
friend
the
jew
entreating
him
in
the
most
pressing
manner
to
employ
all
his
intelligence
in
learning
the
situation
of
the
fair
orphan
that
she
might
be
protected
from
the
villany
of
fathom
until
his
return
to
england
chapter
sixty
he
recompenses
the
attachment
of
his
friend
and
receives
a
letter
that
reduces
him
to
the
verge
of
death
and
distraction
this
step
being
taken
his
mind
in
some
measure
retrieved
its
former
tranquillity
he
soothed
himself
with
the
prospect
of
a
happy
reconciliation
with
the
divine
monimia
and
his
fancy
was
decoyed
from
every
disagreeable
presage
by
the
entertaining
conversation
of
his
sister
with
whom
in
two
days
he
set
out
for
presburg
attended
by
his
friend
the
major
who
had
never
quitted
him
since
their
meeting
at
brussels
here
they
found
count
trebasi
entirely
rid
of
the
fever
which
had
been
occasioned
by
his
wound
and
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
a
circumstance
that
afforded
unspeakable
pleasure
to
melvil
whose
manner
of
thinking
was
such
as
would
have
made
him
unhappy
could
he
have
charged
himself
with
the
death
of
his
mother
husband
howsoever
criminal
he
might
have
been
the
count
ferocity
did
not
return
with
his
health
his
eyes
were
opened
by
the
danger
he
had
incurred
and
his
sentiments
turned
in
a
new
channel
he
heartily
asked
pardon
of
mademoiselle
for
the
rigorous
usage
she
had
suffered
from
the
violence
of
his
temper
thanked
renaldo
for
the
seasonable
lesson
he
had
administered
to
him
and
not
only
insisted
upon
being
removed
from
the
castle
to
a
house
of
his
own
in
presburg
but
proffered
to
make
immediate
restitution
of
all
the
rents
which
he
had
unjustly
converted
to
his
own
use
these
things
being
settled
in
the
most
amicable
manner
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
parties
concerned
as
well
as
of
the
neighbouring
noblesse
among
whom
the
house
of
melvil
was
in
universal
esteem
renaldo
resolved
to
solicit
leave
at
the
imperial
court
to
return
to
england
in
order
to
investigate
that
affair
of
monimia
which
was
more
interesting
than
all
the
points
he
had
hitherto
adjusted
but
before
he
quitted
presburg
his
friend
farrel
taking
him
aside
one
day
count
said
he
will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
if
by
my
zeal
and
attachment
for
you
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
your
esteem
to
doubt
that
esteem
replied
renaldo
were
to
suspect
my
gratitude
and
honour
of
which
i
must
be
utterly
destitute
before
i
lose
the
sense
of
those
obligations
i
owe
to
your
gallantry
and
friendship
obligations
which
i
long
for
a
proper
occasion
to
repay
well
then
resumed
the
major
i
will
deal
with
you
like
a
downright
swiss
and
point
out
a
method
by
which
you
may
shift
the
load
of
obligation
from
your
own
shoulders
to
mine
you
know
my
birth
rank
and
expectations
in
the
service
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
as
my
expense
has
always
unavoidably
exceeded
my
income
i
find
myself
a
little
out
at
elbows
in
my
circumstances
and
want
to
piece
them
up
by
matrimony
of
those
ladies
with
whom
i
think
i
have
any
chance
of
succeeding
mademoiselle
de
melvil
seems
the
best
qualified
to
render
my
situation
happy
in
all
respects
her
fortune
is
more
than
sufficient
to
disembarrass
my
affairs
her
good
sense
will
be
a
seasonable
check
upon
my
vivacity
her
agreeable
accomplishments
will
engage
a
continuation
of
affection
and
regard
i
know
my
own
disposition
well
enough
to
think
i
shall
become
a
most
dutiful
and
tractable
husband
and
shall
deem
myself
highly
honoured
in
being
more
closely
united
to
my
dear
count
de
melvil
the
son
and
representative
of
that
worthy
officer
under
whom
my
youth
was
formed
if
you
will
therefore
sanction
my
claim
i
will
forthwith
begin
my
approaches
and
doubt
not
under
your
auspices
to
bring
the
place
to
a
capitulation
renaldo
was
pleased
with
the
frankness
of
this
declaration
approved
of
his
demand
and
desired
him
to
depend
upon
his
good
offices
with
his
sister
whom
he
sounded
that
same
evening
upon
the
subject
recommending
the
major
to
her
favour
as
a
gentleman
well
worthy
of
her
choice
mademoiselle
who
had
never
been
exercised
in
the
coquetries
of
her
sex
and
was
now
arrived
at
those
years
when
the
vanity
of
youth
ought
to
yield
to
discretion
considered
the
proposal
as
a
philosopher
and
after
due
deliberation
candidly
owned
she
had
no
objection
to
the
match
farrel
was
accordingly
introduced
in
the
character
of
a
lover
after
the
permission
of
the
countess
had
been
obtained
and
he
carried
on
his
addresses
in
the
usual
form
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
in
the
event
that
a
day
was
appointed
for
the
celebration
of
his
nuptials
when
he
entered
into
peaceable
possession
of
his
prize
a
few
days
after
this
joyful
occasion
while
renaldo
was
at
vienna
where
he
had
been
indulged
with
leave
of
absence
for
six
months
and
employed
in
making
preparations
for
his
journey
to
britain
he
was
one
evening
presented
by
his
servant
with
a
package
from
london
which
he
no
sooner
opened
than
he
found
enclosed
a
letter
directed
to
him
in
the
handwriting
of
monimia
he
was
so
much
affected
at
sight
of
those
characters
that
he
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
eager
to
know
the
contents
yet
afraid
to
peruse
the
billet
while
he
hesitated
in
this
suspense
he
chanced
to
cast
his
eye
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
and
perceived
the
name
of
his
jewish
friend
at
the
bottom
of
a
few
lines
importing
that
the
enclosed
was
delivered
to
him
by
a
physician
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
recommended
it
in
a
particular
manner
to
his
care
this
intimation
served
only
to
increase
the
mystery
and
whet
his
impatience
and
as
he
had
the
explanation
in
his
hand
he
summoned
all
his
resolution
to
his
aid
and
breaking
the
seal
began
to
read
these
words
renaldo
will
not
suppose
that
this
address
proceeds
from
interested
motives
when
he
learns
that
before
it
can
be
presented
to
his
view
the
unfortunate
monimia
will
be
no
more
here
the
light
forsook
renaldo
eyes
his
knees
knocked
together
and
he
fell
at
full
length
insensible
on
the
floor
his
valet
hearing
the
noise
ran
into
the
apartment
lifted
him
upon
a
couch
and
despatched
a
messenger
for
proper
assistance
while
he
himself
endeavoured
to
recall
his
spirits
by
such
applications
as
chance
afforded
but
before
the
count
exhibited
any
signs
of
life
his
entered
his
chamber
by
accident
and
as
soon
as
he
recollected
himself
from
the
extreme
confusion
and
concern
produced
by
this
melancholy
spectacle
he
perceived
the
fatal
epistle
which
melvil
though
insensible
still
kept
within
his
grasp
justly
suspecting
this
to
be
the
cause
of
that
severe
paroxysm
he
drew
near
the
couch
and
with
difficulty
read
what
is
above
rehearsed
and
the
sequel
to
this
effect
yes
i
have
taken
such
measures
as
will
prevent
it
from
falling
into
your
hands
until
after
i
shall
have
been
released
from
a
being
embittered
with
inexpressible
misery
and
anguish
it
is
not
my
intention
once
loved
and
ah
still
too
fondly
remembered
youth
to
upbraid
you
as
the
source
of
that
unceasing
woe
which
hath
been
so
long
the
sole
inhabitant
of
my
lonely
bosom
i
will
not
call
you
inconstant
or
unkind
i
dare
not
think
you
base
or
dishonourable
yet
i
was
abruptly
sacrificed
to
a
triumphant
rival
before
i
had
learned
to
bear
such
mortification
before
i
had
overcome
the
prejudices
which
i
had
imbibed
in
my
father
house
i
was
all
at
once
abandoned
to
despair
to
indigence
and
distress
to
the
vile
practices
of
a
villain
who
i
fear
hath
betrayed
us
both
what
have
not
i
suffered
from
the
insults
and
vicious
designs
of
that
wretch
whom
you
cherished
in
your
bosom
yet
to
these
i
owe
this
near
approach
to
that
goal
of
peace
where
the
of
sorrow
will
expire
beware
of
that
artful
traitor
and
oh
endeavour
to
overcome
that
levity
of
disposition
which
if
indulged
will
not
only
stain
your
reputation
but
also
debauch
the
good
qualities
of
your
heart
i
release
you
in
the
sight
of
heaven
from
all
obligations
if
i
have
been
injured
let
not
my
wrongs
be
visited
on
the
head
of
renaldo
for
whom
shall
be
offered
up
the
last
fervent
prayers
of
the
hapless
monimia
this
letter
was
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
of
melvil
distress
though
the
major
had
never
heard
him
mention
the
name
of
this
beauty
he
had
received
such
hints
from
his
own
wife
as
enabled
him
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
the
count
disaster
by
the
administration
of
stimulating
medicines
renaldo
recovered
his
perception
but
this
was
a
cruel
alternative
considering
the
situation
of
his
thoughts
the
first
word
he
pronounced
was
monimia
with
all
the
emphasis
of
the
most
violent
despair
he
perused
the
letter
and
poured
forth
incoherent
execrations
against
fathom
and
himself
he
exclaimed
in
a
frantic
tone
she
is
lost
for
ever
murdered
by
my
unkindness
we
are
both
undone
by
the
infernal
arts
of
fathom
execrable
monster
restore
her
to
my
arms
if
thou
art
not
a
fiend
in
reality
i
will
tear
out
thy
false
heart
so
saying
he
sprung
upon
his
valet
who
would
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
his
undistinguishing
fury
had
not
he
been
saved
by
the
interposition
of
farrel
and
the
family
who
disengaged
him
from
his
master
gripe
by
dint
of
force
yet
notwithstanding
their
joint
endeavours
he
broke
from
this
restraint
leaped
upon
the
floor
and
seizing
his
sword
attempted
to
plunge
it
in
his
own
breast
when
he
was
once
more
overcome
by
numbers
he
cursed
himself
and
all
those
who
withheld
him
swore
he
would
not
survive
the
fair
victim
who
had
perished
by
his
credulity
and
indiscretion
and
the
agitation
of
his
spirits
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
seized
with
strong
convulsions
which
nature
was
scarce
able
to
sustain
every
medical
expedient
was
used
to
quiet
his
perturbation
which
at
length
yielded
so
far
as
to
subside
into
a
continual
fever
and
confirmed
delirium
during
which
he
ceased
not
to
pour
forth
the
most
pathetic
complaints
touching
his
ruined
love
and
to
rave
about
the
monimia
the
major
half
distracted
by
the
calamity
of
his
friend
would
have
concealed
it
from
the
knowledge
of
his
family
had
not
the
physician
by
despairing
of
his
life
laid
him
under
the
necessity
of
making
them
acquainted
with
his
condition
the
countess
and
farrel
were
no
sooner
informed
of
his
case
than
they
hastened
to
the
melancholy
scene
where
they
found
renaldo
deprived
of
his
senses
panting
under
the
rage
of
an
exasperated
disease
they
saw
his
face
distorted
and
his
eyes
glaring
with
frenzy
they
heard
him
invoke
the
name
of
monimia
with
a
tenderness
of
accent
which
even
the
impulse
of
madness
could
not
destroy
then
with
a
sudden
transition
of
tone
and
gesture
he
denounced
vengeance
against
her
betrayer
and
called
upon
the
north
wind
to
cool
the
fervour
of
his
brain
his
hair
hung
in
dishevelled
parcels
his
cheeks
were
wan
his
looks
ghastly
his
vigour
was
fled
and
all
the
glory
of
his
youth
faded
the
physician
hung
his
head
in
silence
the
attendants
wrung
their
hands
in
despair
and
the
countenance
of
his
friend
was
bathed
in
tears
such
a
picture
would
have
moved
the
most
obdurate
heart
what
impression
then
must
it
have
made
upon
a
parent
and
sister
melting
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
affection
the
mother
was
struck
dumb
and
stupefied
with
grief
the
sister
threw
herself
on
the
bed
in
a
transport
of
sorrow
caught
her
loved
renaldo
in
her
arms
and
was
with
great
difficulty
torn
from
his
embrace
such
was
the
dismal
reverse
that
overtook
the
late
so
happy
family
of
melvil
such
was
the
extremity
to
which
the
treachery
of
fathom
had
reduced
his
best
benefactor
three
days
did
nature
struggle
with
surprising
efforts
and
then
the
constitution
seemed
to
sink
under
the
victorious
fever
yet
as
his
strength
diminished
his
delirium
abated
and
on
the
fifth
morning
he
looked
round
and
recognised
his
weeping
friends
though
now
exhausted
to
the
lowest
ebb
of
life
he
retained
the
perfect
use
of
speech
and
his
reason
being
quite
unclouded
spoke
to
each
with
equal
kindness
and
composure
he
congratulated
himself
upon
the
sight
of
shore
after
the
horrors
of
such
a
tempest
called
upon
the
countess
and
his
sister
who
were
not
permitted
to
see
him
at
such
a
conjuncture
and
being
apprised
by
the
major
of
his
reason
for
excluding
them
from
his
presence
he
applauded
his
concern
bequeathed
them
to
his
future
care
and
took
leave
of
that
gentleman
with
a
cordial
embrace
then
he
desired
to
be
left
in
private
with
a
certain
clergyman
who
regulated
the
concerns
of
his
soul
and
he
being
dismissed
turned
his
face
from
the
light
in
expectation
of
his
final
discharge
in
a
few
minutes
all
was
still
and
dreary
he
was
no
longer
heard
to
breathe
no
more
the
stream
of
life
was
perceived
to
circulate
he
was
supposed
to
be
absolved
from
all
his
cares
and
an
universal
groan
from
the
bystanders
announced
the
decease
of
the
gallant
generous
and
renaldo
come
hither
ye
whom
the
pride
of
youth
and
health
of
birth
and
affluence
inflames
who
tread
the
flowery
maze
of
pleasure
trusting
to
the
fruition
of
joys
ye
who
glory
in
your
accomplishments
who
indulge
the
views
of
ambition
and
lay
schemes
for
future
happiness
and
grandeur
contemplate
here
the
vanity
of
life
behold
how
low
this
excellent
young
man
is
laid
mowed
down
even
in
the
blossom
of
his
youth
when
fortune
seemed
to
open
all
her
treasures
to
his
worth
such
were
the
reflections
of
the
generous
farrel
who
while
he
performed
the
last
office
of
friendship
in
closing
the
eyes
of
the
melvil
perceived
a
warmth
on
the
skin
which
the
hand
of
death
seldom
leaves
unextinguished
this
uncommon
sensation
he
reported
to
the
physician
who
though
he
could
feel
no
pulsation
of
the
heart
or
arteries
conjectured
that
life
still
lingered
in
some
of
its
interior
haunts
and
immediately
ordered
such
applications
to
the
extremities
and
surface
of
the
body
as
might
help
to
concentrate
and
reinforce
the
natural
heat
by
these
prescriptions
which
for
some
time
produced
no
sensible
effect
the
embers
were
in
all
probability
kept
glowing
and
the
vital
power
revived
for
after
a
considerable
pause
respiration
was
gradually
renewed
at
long
intervals
a
languid
motion
was
perceived
at
the
heart
a
few
feeble
and
irregular
pulsations
were
felt
at
the
wrist
the
livery
of
death
began
to
vanish
from
his
face
the
circulation
acquired
new
force
and
he
opened
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
which
proclaimed
his
return
from
the
shades
of
death
when
he
recovered
the
faculty
of
swallowing
a
cordial
was
administered
and
whether
the
fever
abated
in
consequence
of
the
blood
being
cooled
and
condensed
during
the
recess
of
action
in
the
solids
or
nature
in
that
agony
had
prepared
a
proper
channel
for
the
expulsion
of
the
disease
certain
it
is
he
was
from
this
moment
rid
of
all
bodily
pain
he
retrieved
the
animal
functions
and
nothing
remained
of
his
malady
but
an
extreme
weakness
and
languor
the
effect
of
nature
being
fatigued
in
the
battle
she
had
won
unutterable
was
the
joy
that
took
possession
of
his
mother
and
sister
when
farrel
flew
into
her
apartment
to
intimate
this
happy
turn
scarce
could
they
be
restrained
from
pouring
forth
their
transports
in
the
presence
of
renaldo
who
was
still
too
feeble
to
endure
such
communication
indeed
he
was
extremely
mortified
and
dejected
at
this
event
which
had
diffused
such
pleasure
and
satisfaction
among
his
friends
for
though
his
distemper
was
mastered
the
fatal
cause
of
it
still
rankled
at
his
heart
and
he
considered
this
respite
from
death
as
a
protraction
of
his
misery
when
he
was
congratulated
by
the
major
on
the
triumph
of
his
constitution
he
replied
with
a
groan
i
would
to
heaven
it
had
been
otherwise
for
i
am
reserved
for
all
the
horrors
of
the
most
poignant
sorrow
and
remorse
o
monimia
monimia
i
hoped
by
this
time
to
have
convinced
thy
gentle
shade
that
i
was
at
least
intentionally
innocent
of
that
ruthless
barbarity
which
hath
brought
thee
to
an
untimely
grave
heaven
and
earth
do
i
still
survive
the
consciousness
of
that
dire
catastrophe
and
lives
the
atrocious
villain
who
hath
blasted
all
our
hopes
with
these
last
words
the
fire
darted
from
his
eyes
and
his
brother
snatching
this
occasional
handle
for
reconciling
him
to
life
joined
in
his
exclamations
against
the
treacherous
fathom
and
observed
that
he
should
not
in
point
of
honour
wish
to
die
until
he
should
have
sacrificed
that
traitor
to
the
manes
of
the
beauteous
monimia
this
incitement
acted
as
a
spur
upon
exhausted
nature
causing
the
blood
to
circulate
with
fresh
vigour
and
encouraging
him
to
take
such
sustenance
as
would
recruit
his
strength
and
repair
the
damage
which
his
health
had
sustained
his
sister
assiduously
attended
him
in
his
recovery
flattering
his
appetite
and
amusing
his
sorrow
at
the
same
time
the
clergyman
assailed
his
despondence
with
religious
weapons
as
well
as
with
arguments
drawn
from
philosophy
and
the
fury
of
his
passions
being
already
expended
he
became
so
tractable
as
to
listen
to
his
remonstrances
but
notwithstanding
the
joint
endeavours
of
all
his
friends
a
deep
fixed
melancholy
remained
after
every
consequence
of
his
disease
had
vanished
in
vain
they
essayed
to
elude
his
grief
by
gaiety
and
diversions
in
vain
they
tried
to
decoy
his
heart
into
some
new
engagement
these
kind
attempts
served
only
to
feed
and
nourish
that
melancholy
which
pined
within
his
bosom
monimia
still
haunted
him
in
the
midst
of
these
amusements
while
his
reflection
whispered
to
him
pleasures
like
these
i
might
have
relished
with
her
participation
that
darling
idea
mingled
in
all
the
female
assemblies
at
which
he
was
present
eclipsing
their
attractions
and
enhancing
the
bitterness
of
his
loss
for
absence
enthusiasm
and
even
his
despair
had
heightened
the
charms
of
the
fair
orphan
into
something
supernatural
and
divine
time
that
commonly
weakens
the
traces
of
remembrance
seemed
to
deepen
its
impressions
in
his
breast
nightly
in
his
dreams
did
he
converse
with
his
dear
monimia
sometimes
on
the
verdant
bank
of
a
delightful
stream
where
he
breathed
in
soft
murmurs
the
dictates
of
his
love
and
admiration
sometimes
reclined
within
the
tufted
grove
his
arm
encircled
and
sustained
her
snowy
neck
whilst
she
with
looks
of
love
ineffable
gazed
on
his
face
invoking
heaven
to
bless
her
husband
and
her
lord
yet
even
in
these
illusions
was
his
fancy
oft
alarmed
for
the
fair
sometimes
he
viewed
her
tottering
on
the
brink
of
a
steep
precipice
far
distant
from
his
helping
hand
at
other
times
she
seemed
to
sail
along
the
boisterous
tide
imploring
his
assistance
then
would
he
start
with
horror
from
his
sleep
and
feel
his
sorrows
more
than
realised
he
deserted
his
couch
he
avoided
the
society
of
mankind
he
courted
sequestered
shades
where
he
could
indulge
his
melancholy
there
his
mind
brooded
over
his
calamity
until
his
imagination
became
familiar
with
all
the
ravages
of
death
it
contemplated
the
gradual
decline
of
monimia
health
her
tears
her
distress
her
despair
at
his
imagined
cruelty
he
saw
through
that
perspective
every
blossom
of
her
beauty
wither
every
sparkle
vanish
from
her
eyes
he
beheld
her
faded
lips
her
pale
cheek
and
her
inanimated
features
the
symmetry
of
which
not
death
itself
was
able
to
destroy
his
fancy
conveyed
her
breathless
corse
to
the
cold
grave
which
perhaps
no
tear
humane
was
shed
where
her
delicate
limbs
were
consigned
to
dust
where
she
was
dished
out
a
delicious
banquet
to
the
unsparing
worm
over
these
pictures
he
dwelt
with
a
sort
of
pleasing
anguish
until
he
became
so
enamoured
of
her
tomb
that
he
could
no
longer
resist
the
desire
that
compelled
him
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
dear
hallowed
spot
where
all
his
once
gay
hopes
lay
buried
that
he
might
nightly
visit
the
silent
habitation
of
his
ruined
love
embrace
the
sacred
earth
with
which
she
was
now
compounded
moisten
it
with
his
tears
and
bid
the
turf
lie
easy
on
her
breast
besides
the
prospect
of
this
gloomy
enjoyment
he
was
urged
to
return
to
england
by
an
eager
desire
of
taking
vengeance
on
the
perfidious
fathom
as
well
as
of
acquitting
himself
of
the
obligations
he
owed
in
that
kingdom
to
those
who
had
assisted
him
in
his
distress
he
therefore
communicated
his
intention
to
farrel
who
would
have
insisted
upon
attending
him
in
the
journey
had
not
he
been
conjured
to
stay
and
manage
renaldo
affairs
in
his
absence
every
previous
step
being
taken
he
took
leave
of
the
countess
and
his
sister
who
had
with
all
their
interest
and
elocution
opposed
his
design
the
execution
of
which
they
justly
feared
would
instead
of
dissipating
augment
his
chagrin
and
now
seeing
him
determined
they
shed
a
flood
of
tears
at
his
departure
and
he
set
out
from
vienna
in
a
accompanied
by
a
trusty
on
horseback
chapter
renaldo
meets
with
a
living
monument
of
justice
and
encounters
a
personage
of
some
note
in
these
memoirs
as
this
domestic
was
very
well
qualified
for
making
all
the
proper
dispositions
and
adjusting
every
necessary
article
on
the
road
renaldo
totally
abstracted
himself
from
earthly
considerations
and
mused
without
ceasing
on
that
theme
which
was
the
constant
subject
of
his
contemplation
he
was
blind
to
the
objects
that
surrounded
him
he
scarce
ever
felt
the
importunities
of
nature
and
had
not
they
been
reinforced
by
the
pressing
entreaties
of
his
attendant
he
would
have
proceeded
without
refreshment
or
repose
in
this
absence
of
mind
did
he
traverse
a
great
part
of
germany
in
his
way
to
the
austrian
netherlands
and
arrived
at
the
fortress
of
luxemburg
where
he
was
obliged
to
tarry
a
whole
day
on
account
of
an
accident
which
had
happened
to
his
chaise
here
he
went
to
view
the
fortifications
and
as
he
walked
along
the
ramparts
his
ears
were
saluted
with
these
words
heaven
bless
the
noble
count
de
melvil
will
not
he
turn
the
eyes
of
compassion
on
an
old
reduced
to
misfortune
and
disgrace
surprised
at
this
address
which
was
attended
with
the
clanking
of
chains
renaldo
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
perceived
the
person
who
spoke
to
be
one
of
two
malefactors
shackled
together
who
had
been
sentenced
for
some
crime
to
work
as
labourers
on
the
fortifications
his
face
was
so
covered
with
hair
and
his
whole
appearance
so
disguised
by
the
squalid
habit
which
he
wore
that
the
count
could
not
recollect
his
features
until
he
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
name
was
ratchcali
melvil
immediately
recognised
his
at
vienna
and
his
upon
the
rhine
and
expressed
equal
surprise
and
concern
at
seeing
him
in
such
a
deplorable
situation
nothing
renders
the
soul
so
callous
and
insensible
as
the
searing
brands
of
infamy
and
disgrace
without
betraying
the
least
symptoms
of
shame
or
confusion
count
says
he
this
is
the
fate
of
war
at
least
of
the
war
in
which
i
have
been
engaged
ever
since
i
took
leave
of
the
imperial
army
and
retreated
with
your
old
companion
fathom
long
life
to
that
original
genius
if
he
is
not
unhappily
eclipsed
by
some
unfortunate
interposition
before
his
terrene
parts
are
purified
i
foresee
that
he
will
shine
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
in
the
world
of
adventure
at
mention
of
this
detested
name
renaldo
heart
began
to
throb
with
indignation
yet
he
suppressed
the
emotion
and
desired
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
splendid
encomium
which
he
had
bestowed
upon
his
confederate
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
replied
ratchcali
for
a
man
in
my
present
situation
to
equivocate
or
disguise
the
truth
the
nature
of
my
disgrace
is
perfectly
well
known
i
am
condemned
to
hard
labour
for
life
and
unless
some
lucky
accident
which
i
can
not
now
foresee
shall
intervene
all
i
can
expect
is
some
alleviation
of
my
hard
lot
from
the
generosity
of
such
gentlemen
as
you
who
compassionate
the
sufferings
of
your
in
order
to
engage
your
benevolence
the
more
in
my
behalf
i
shall
if
you
will
give
me
the
hearing
faithfully
inform
you
of
some
particulars
which
it
may
import
you
to
know
concerning
my
old
acquaintance
ferdinand
count
fathom
whose
real
character
hath
perhaps
hitherto
escaped
your
notice
then
he
proceeded
to
give
a
regular
detail
of
all
the
strokes
of
finesse
which
he
in
conjunction
with
our
adventurer
had
practised
upon
melvil
and
others
during
their
residence
at
vienna
and
the
campaigns
they
had
made
upon
the
rhine
he
explained
the
nature
of
the
robbery
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
done
by
the
count
valet
together
with
the
manner
of
their
desertion
he
described
his
separation
from
fathom
their
meeting
at
london
the
traffic
they
carried
on
in
copartnership
and
the
misfortune
that
reduced
ferdinand
to
the
condition
in
which
he
was
found
by
melvil
after
having
gratified
the
honest
lawyer
said
he
with
a
share
of
the
unfortunate
fathom
spoils
and
packed
up
all
my
own
valuable
effects
my
new
auxiliary
maurice
and
i
posted
to
harwich
embarked
in
the
and
next
day
arrived
at
helvoetsluys
from
thence
we
repaired
to
the
hague
in
order
to
mingle
in
the
gaieties
of
the
place
and
exercise
our
talents
at
play
which
is
there
cultivated
with
universal
eagerness
but
chancing
to
meet
with
an
old
acquaintance
whom
i
did
not
at
all
desire
to
see
i
found
it
convenient
to
withdraw
softly
to
rotterdam
from
whence
we
set
out
for
antwerp
and
having
made
a
tour
of
the
austrian
netherlands
set
up
our
rest
at
brussels
and
concerted
a
plan
for
laying
the
flemings
under
contribution
from
our
appearance
we
procured
admission
into
the
most
polite
assemblies
and
succeeded
to
a
wonder
in
all
our
operations
until
our
career
was
unfortunately
checked
by
the
indiscretion
of
my
ally
who
being
detected
in
the
very
act
of
conveying
a
card
was
immediately
introduced
to
a
magistrate
and
this
minister
of
justice
was
so
curious
inquisitive
and
that
count
maurice
finding
it
impossible
to
elude
his
penetration
was
fain
to
stipulate
for
his
own
safety
by
giving
up
his
friend
to
the
cognisance
of
the
law
i
was
accordingly
apprehended
before
i
knew
the
cause
of
my
arrest
and
being
unhappily
known
by
some
soldiers
of
the
prince
guard
my
character
turned
out
so
little
to
the
approbation
of
the
inquisitors
that
all
my
effects
were
confiscated
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
and
i
was
by
a
formal
sentence
condemned
to
labour
on
the
fortifications
all
the
days
of
my
life
while
maurice
escaped
at
the
expense
of
five
hundred
stripes
which
he
received
in
public
from
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
thus
have
i
without
evasion
or
mental
reservation
given
a
faithful
account
of
the
steps
by
which
i
have
arrived
at
this
barrier
which
is
likely
to
be
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
my
peregrinations
unless
the
generous
count
de
melvil
will
deign
to
interpose
his
interest
in
behalf
of
an
old
who
may
yet
live
to
justify
his
mediation
renaldo
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
story
every
circumstance
of
which
tended
to
corroborate
the
intelligence
he
had
already
received
touching
the
character
of
fathom
whom
he
now
considered
with
a
double
portion
of
abhorrence
as
the
most
abandoned
miscreant
that
nature
had
ever
produced
though
ratchcali
did
not
possess
a
much
higher
place
in
his
opinion
he
favoured
him
with
marks
of
his
bounty
and
exhorted
him
if
possible
to
reform
his
heart
but
he
would
by
no
means
promise
to
interpose
his
credit
in
favour
of
a
wretch
of
such
enormous
villany
and
fraud
he
could
not
help
moralising
upon
this
rencontre
which
inspired
him
with
great
contempt
for
human
nature
and
next
day
he
proceeded
on
his
journey
with
a
heavy
heart
ruminating
on
the
perfidy
of
mankind
and
between
whiles
transported
with
the
prospect
of
revenging
all
his
calamities
upon
the
accursed
author
while
he
was
wrapped
up
in
these
reveries
his
carriage
rolled
along
and
had
already
entered
a
wood
between
mons
and
tournay
when
his
dream
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
explosion
of
several
pistols
that
were
fired
among
the
thickets
at
a
little
distance
from
the
road
roused
at
this
alarm
he
snatched
his
sword
that
stood
by
him
and
springing
from
the
chaise
ran
directly
towards
the
spot
being
close
followed
by
his
valet
who
had
alighted
and
armed
himself
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
about
forty
yards
from
the
highway
they
arrived
in
a
little
glade
or
opening
where
they
saw
a
single
man
standing
at
bay
against
five
banditti
after
having
killed
one
of
their
companions
and
lost
his
own
horse
that
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
melvil
seeing
this
odds
and
immediately
guessing
their
design
rushed
among
them
without
hesitation
and
in
an
instant
ran
his
sword
through
the
heart
of
one
whose
hand
was
raised
to
smite
the
gentleman
behind
while
he
was
engaged
with
the
rest
in
front
at
the
same
time
the
valet
disabled
another
by
a
shot
in
the
shoulder
so
that
the
number
being
now
equal
on
both
sides
a
furious
combat
ensued
every
man
being
paired
with
an
antagonist
and
each
having
recourse
to
swords
as
all
their
pieces
had
been
discharged
renaldo
adversary
finding
himself
pressed
with
equal
fury
and
skill
retreated
gradually
among
the
trees
until
he
vanished
altogether
into
the
thickest
of
the
wood
and
his
two
companions
followed
his
example
with
great
ease
the
being
hurt
in
the
leg
and
the
stranger
so
much
exhausted
by
the
wounds
he
had
received
before
renaldo
interposition
that
when
the
young
gentleman
approached
to
congratulate
him
on
the
defeat
of
the
robbers
he
in
advancing
to
embrace
his
deliverer
dropped
down
motionless
on
the
grass
the
count
with
that
warmth
of
sympathy
and
benevolence
which
was
natural
to
his
heart
lifted
up
the
wounded
cavalier
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
the
chaise
in
which
he
was
deposited
while
the
reloaded
his
pistols
and
prepared
for
a
second
attack
as
they
did
not
doubt
that
the
banditti
would
return
with
a
reinforcement
however
before
they
reappeared
renaldo
driver
disengaged
him
from
the
wood
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
arrived
at
a
village
where
they
halted
for
assistance
to
the
stranger
who
though
still
alive
had
not
recovered
the
use
of
his
senses
after
he
was
undressed
and
laid
in
a
warm
bed
a
surgeon
examined
his
body
and
found
a
wound
in
his
neck
by
a
sword
and
another
in
his
right
side
occasioned
by
a
so
that
his
prognostic
was
very
dubious
meanwhile
he
applied
proper
dressings
to
both
and
in
half
an
hour
after
this
administration
the
gentleman
gave
some
tokens
of
perception
he
looked
around
him
with
a
wildness
of
fury
in
his
aspect
as
if
he
had
thought
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
robbers
by
whom
he
had
been
attacked
but
when
he
saw
the
assiduity
with
which
the
bystanders
exerted
themselves
in
his
behalf
one
raising
his
head
from
the
pillow
while
another
exhorted
him
to
swallow
a
little
wine
which
was
warmed
for
the
purpose
when
he
beheld
the
sympathising
looks
of
all
present
and
heard
himself
accosted
in
the
most
cordial
terms
by
the
person
whom
he
recollected
as
his
deliverer
all
the
severity
vanished
from
his
countenance
he
took
renaldo
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
while
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
praised
be
god
said
he
that
virtue
and
generosity
are
still
to
be
found
among
the
sons
of
men
everybody
in
the
apartment
was
affected
by
this
exclamation
and
melvil
above
all
the
rest
felt
such
emotions
as
he
could
scarcely
restrain
he
entreated
the
gentleman
to
believe
himself
in
the
midst
of
such
friends
as
would
effectually
secure
him
from
all
violence
and
mortification
he
conjured
him
to
compose
the
perturbation
of
his
spirits
and
quiet
the
apprehensions
of
his
mind
with
that
reflection
and
protested
that
he
himself
would
not
quit
the
house
while
his
attendance
should
be
deemed
necessary
for
the
stranger
cure
or
his
conversation
conducive
to
his
amusement
these
assurances
considered
with
the
heroic
part
which
the
young
hungarian
had
already
acted
in
his
behalf
inspired
the
cavalier
with
such
a
sublime
idea
of
melvil
that
he
gazed
upon
him
with
silent
astonishment
as
an
angel
sent
from
heaven
for
his
succour
and
in
the
transport
of
his
gratitude
could
not
help
exclaiming
sure
providence
hath
still
something
in
reserve
for
this
unfortunate
wretch
in
whose
favour
such
a
miracle
of
courage
and
generosity
hath
interposed
being
accommodated
with
proper
care
and
attendance
his
constitution
in
a
little
time
overcame
the
fever
and
at
the
third
dressing
the
surgeon
declared
him
out
of
all
danger
from
his
wounds
then
was
renaldo
indulged
with
opportunities
of
conversing
with
the
patient
and
of
inquiring
into
the
particulars
of
his
fortune
and
designs
in
life
with
a
view
to
manifest
the
inclination
he
felt
to
serve
him
in
his
future
occasions
the
more
this
stranger
contemplated
the
character
of
the
count
the
more
his
amazement
increased
on
account
of
his
extraordinary
benevolence
in
favour
of
a
person
whose
merit
he
could
not
possibly
know
he
even
expressed
his
surprise
on
this
subject
to
renaldo
who
at
length
told
him
that
although
his
best
offices
should
always
be
ready
for
the
occasions
of
any
gentleman
in
distress
his
particular
attachment
and
regard
to
him
was
improved
by
an
additional
consideration
i
am
no
stranger
said
he
to
the
virtues
and
honour
of
the
gallant
don
diego
de
zelos
heaven
and
earth
cried
the
stranger
starting
from
his
seat
with
extreme
emotion
do
i
then
live
to
hear
myself
addressed
by
that
appellation
my
heart
glows
at
the
expression
my
spirits
are
kindled
with
a
flame
that
thrills
through
every
nerve
say
young
gentleman
if
you
are
really
an
inhabitant
of
earth
by
what
means
are
you
acquainted
with
the
unhappy
name
of
zelos
in
answer
to
this
eager
interrogation
renaldo
gave
him
to
understand
that
in
the
course
of
his
travels
he
had
resided
a
short
time
at
seville
where
he
had
frequently
seen
don
diego
and
often
heard
his
character
mentioned
with
uncommon
esteem
and
veneration
alas
replied
the
castilian
that
justice
is
no
longer
done
to
the
wretched
zelos
his
honours
are
blasted
and
his
reputation
by
the
venomous
tooth
of
slander
he
then
proceeded
to
unfold
his
misfortunes
as
they
have
already
been
explained
in
the
former
part
of
these
memoirs
at
the
recapitulation
of
which
the
heart
of
melvil
being
intendered
by
his
own
calamities
was
so
deeply
affected
that
he
the
groans
of
don
diego
and
wept
over
his
sufferings
with
the
most
filial
sympathy
when
he
repeated
the
story
of
that
cruel
fraud
which
was
practised
upon
him
by
the
faithless
fadini
melvil
whose
mind
and
imagination
teemed
with
the
villanies
of
fathom
was
immediately
struck
with
the
conjecture
of
his
being
the
knave
because
indeed
he
could
not
believe
that
any
other
person
was
so
abandoned
by
principle
and
humanity
as
to
take
such
a
barbarous
advantage
of
a
gentleman
in
distress
chapter
his
return
to
england
and
midnight
pilgrimage
to
monimia
tomb
he
considered
the
date
of
that
unparalleled
transaction
which
agreed
with
his
conjecture
and
from
the
inquiries
he
made
concerning
the
person
of
the
traitor
gathered
reasons
sufficient
to
confirm
his
supposition
thus
certified
that
is
the
villain
cried
the
count
whose
infernal
arts
have
overwhelmed
me
with
such
misery
as
heaven
itself
hath
made
no
remedy
to
dispel
to
revenge
my
wrongs
on
that
perfidious
miscreant
is
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
which
i
deign
to
drag
about
an
hateful
being
o
don
diego
what
is
life
when
all
its
enjoyments
are
so
easily
poisoned
by
the
machinations
of
such
a
worm
so
saying
he
smote
his
breast
in
all
the
agony
of
woe
and
besought
the
spaniard
to
relate
the
steps
he
took
in
consequence
of
this
disaster
the
castilian
cheeks
reddened
at
this
information
which
enforced
his
own
resentment
and
casting
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
sacred
powers
cried
he
let
him
not
perish
before
you
bring
him
within
my
reach
you
ask
me
noble
cavalier
what
measures
i
took
in
this
abyss
of
misery
for
the
first
day
i
was
tortured
with
apprehensions
for
the
friendly
fadini
fearing
that
he
had
been
robbed
and
murdered
for
the
jewels
which
he
had
perhaps
too
unwarily
exposed
to
sale
but
this
terror
soon
vanished
before
the
true
presages
of
my
fate
when
on
the
morrow
i
found
the
whole
family
in
tears
and
confusion
and
heard
my
landlord
pour
forth
the
most
bitter
imprecations
against
the
fugitive
who
had
deflowered
his
daughter
and
even
robbed
the
house
you
will
ask
which
of
the
passions
of
my
heart
were
interested
on
this
occasion
they
were
shame
and
indignation
all
my
grief
flowed
in
another
channel
i
blushed
to
find
my
judgment
deceived
i
scorned
to
complain
but
in
my
heart
denounced
vengeance
against
my
base
betrayer
i
silently
retired
to
my
apartment
in
order
to
commune
with
my
own
thoughts
i
had
borne
greater
calamities
without
being
driven
to
despair
i
summoned
all
my
fortitude
to
my
assistance
and
resolved
to
live
in
spite
of
affliction
thus
determined
i
betook
myself
to
the
house
of
a
general
officer
whose
character
was
fair
in
the
world
and
having
obtained
admission
in
consequence
of
my
oriental
appearance
a
man
of
honour
said
i
unfortunate
need
no
introduction
my
habit
proclaims
me
a
persian
this
passport
from
the
states
of
holland
will
confirm
that
supposition
i
have
been
robbed
of
jewels
to
a
considerable
value
by
a
wretch
whom
i
favoured
with
my
confidence
and
now
reduced
to
extreme
indigence
i
come
to
offer
myself
as
a
soldier
in
the
armies
of
france
i
have
health
and
strength
sufficient
to
discharge
that
duty
nor
am
i
unacquainted
with
a
military
life
which
was
once
my
glory
and
occupation
i
therefore
sue
for
your
protection
that
i
may
be
received
though
in
the
lowest
order
of
them
that
serve
the
king
and
that
your
future
favour
may
depend
upon
my
behaviour
in
that
capacity
the
general
surprised
at
my
declaration
surveyed
me
with
uncommon
attention
he
perused
my
certificate
asked
divers
questions
concerning
the
art
of
war
to
which
i
returned
such
answers
as
convinced
him
that
i
was
not
wholly
ignorant
in
that
particular
in
short
i
was
enlisted
as
a
volunteer
in
his
own
regiment
and
soon
after
promoted
to
the
rank
of
a
subaltern
and
the
office
of
equerry
to
his
own
son
who
at
that
time
had
attained
to
the
degree
of
colonel
though
his
age
did
not
exceed
eighteen
years
this
young
man
was
naturally
of
a
ferocious
disposition
which
had
been
rendered
quite
untractable
by
the
pride
of
birth
and
fortune
together
with
the
licence
of
his
education
as
he
did
not
know
the
respect
due
to
a
gentleman
so
he
could
not
possibly
pay
it
to
those
who
were
unfortunately
under
his
command
divers
mortifications
i
sustained
with
that
fortitude
which
became
a
castilian
who
lay
under
obligations
to
the
father
till
at
length
laying
aside
all
decorum
he
smote
me
sacred
heaven
he
smote
don
diego
de
zelos
in
presence
of
his
whole
household
had
my
sword
been
endowed
with
sensation
it
would
of
itself
have
started
from
its
scabbard
at
this
indignity
offered
to
its
master
i
unsheathed
it
without
deliberation
saying
insolent
boy
he
is
a
gentleman
whom
thou
hast
outraged
and
thou
hast
thus
cancelled
the
ties
which
have
hitherto
restrained
my
indignation
his
servants
would
have
interposed
but
he
commanded
them
to
retire
and
flushed
with
that
confidence
which
the
impetuosity
of
his
temper
inspired
he
drew
in
his
turn
and
attacked
me
with
redoubled
rage
but
his
dexterity
being
very
unequal
to
his
courage
he
was
soon
disarmed
and
overthrown
when
pointing
my
sword
to
his
breast
consideration
of
thy
youth
and
ignorance
said
i
spare
that
life
which
thou
hast
forfeited
by
thy
ungenerous
presumption
with
these
words
i
put
up
my
weapon
retired
through
the
midst
of
his
domestics
who
seeing
their
master
safe
did
not
think
proper
to
oppose
my
passage
and
mounting
my
horse
in
less
than
two
hours
entered
the
austrian
dominions
resolving
to
proceed
as
far
as
holland
that
i
might
embark
in
the
first
ship
for
spain
in
order
to
wash
away
with
my
own
blood
or
that
of
my
enemies
the
cruel
stain
which
hath
so
long
defiled
my
reputation
this
was
the
grievance
that
still
corroded
my
heart
and
rendered
ineffectual
the
inhuman
sacrifice
i
had
made
to
my
injured
honour
this
was
the
consideration
that
incessantly
prompted
and
still
importunes
me
to
run
every
risk
of
life
and
fortune
rather
than
leave
my
fame
under
such
an
ignominious
aspersion
i
purpose
to
obey
this
internal
call
i
am
apt
to
believe
it
is
the
voice
of
heaven
of
that
providence
which
manifested
its
care
by
sending
such
a
generous
auxiliary
to
my
aid
when
i
was
overpowered
by
banditti
on
the
very
first
day
of
my
expedition
having
in
this
manner
gratified
the
curiosity
of
his
deliverer
he
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
the
quality
of
him
to
whom
he
was
so
signally
obliged
and
renaldo
did
not
scruple
to
make
the
castilian
acquainted
with
his
name
and
family
he
likewise
communicated
the
story
of
his
unfortunate
love
with
all
the
symptoms
of
unutterable
woe
which
drew
tears
from
the
spaniard
while
with
a
groan
that
announced
the
load
which
overwhelmed
his
soul
i
had
a
daughter
said
he
such
as
you
describe
the
peerless
monimia
had
heaven
decreed
her
for
the
arms
of
such
a
lover
i
who
am
now
the
most
wretched
should
have
been
the
most
happy
parent
upon
earth
thus
did
these
new
friends
alternately
indulge
their
mutual
sorrow
and
concert
measures
for
their
future
operations
melvil
earnestly
solicited
the
castilian
to
favour
him
with
his
company
to
england
where
in
all
probability
both
would
enjoy
the
gloomy
satisfaction
of
being
revenged
upon
their
common
betrayer
fathom
and
as
a
farther
inducement
he
assured
him
that
as
soon
as
he
should
have
accomplished
the
melancholy
purposes
of
his
voyage
he
would
accompany
don
diego
to
spain
and
employ
his
whole
interest
and
fortune
in
his
service
the
spaniard
thunderstruck
at
the
extravagant
generosity
of
this
proposal
could
scarce
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
and
after
some
pause
replied
my
duty
would
teach
me
to
obey
any
command
you
should
think
proper
to
impose
but
here
my
inclination
and
interest
are
so
agreeably
flattered
that
i
should
be
equally
ungrateful
and
unwise
in
pretending
to
comply
with
reluctance
this
point
being
settled
they
moved
forwards
to
mons
as
soon
as
don
diego
was
in
a
condition
to
bear
the
shock
of
such
a
removal
and
there
remaining
until
his
wounds
were
perfectly
cured
they
hired
a
for
ostend
embarked
in
a
vessel
at
that
port
reached
the
opposite
shore
of
england
after
a
short
and
easy
passage
and
arrived
in
london
without
having
met
with
any
sinister
accident
on
the
road
as
they
approached
this
capital
renaldo
grief
seemed
to
regurgitate
with
redoubled
violence
his
memory
was
waked
to
the
most
minute
and
painful
exertion
of
its
faculties
his
imagination
teemed
with
the
most
afflicting
images
and
his
impatience
became
so
ardent
that
never
lover
panted
more
eagerly
for
the
consummation
of
his
wishes
than
melvil
for
an
opportunity
of
stretching
himself
upon
the
grave
of
the
lost
monimia
the
castilian
was
astonished
as
well
as
affected
at
the
poignancy
of
his
grief
which
as
a
proof
of
his
susceptibility
and
virtue
endeared
him
still
more
to
his
affection
and
though
his
own
misfortunes
had
rendered
him
very
unfit
for
the
office
of
a
comforter
he
endeavoured
by
soothing
discourse
to
moderate
the
excess
of
his
friend
affliction
though
it
was
dark
when
they
alighted
at
the
inn
melvil
ordered
a
coach
to
be
called
and
being
attended
by
the
spaniard
who
would
not
be
persuaded
to
quit
him
upon
such
an
occasion
he
repaired
to
the
house
of
the
generous
jew
whose
rheum
distilled
very
plentifully
at
his
approach
the
count
had
already
acquitted
himself
in
point
of
pecuniary
obligations
to
this
benevolent
hebrew
and
now
after
having
made
such
acknowledgments
as
might
be
expected
from
a
youth
of
his
disposition
he
begged
to
know
by
what
channel
he
had
received
that
letter
which
he
had
been
so
kind
as
to
forward
to
vienna
joshua
who
was
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
that
epistle
and
saw
the
young
gentleman
extremely
moved
would
have
eluded
his
inquiry
by
pretending
he
had
forgot
the
circumstance
but
when
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
case
which
was
not
explained
without
the
manifestation
of
the
utmost
inquietude
he
heartily
condoled
the
desponding
lover
telling
him
he
had
in
vain
employed
all
his
intelligence
about
that
unfortunate
beauty
in
consequence
of
melvil
letter
to
him
on
that
subject
and
then
directed
him
to
the
house
of
the
physician
who
had
brought
the
fatal
billet
which
had
made
him
miserable
no
sooner
did
he
receive
this
information
than
he
took
his
leave
abruptly
with
promise
of
returning
next
day
and
hied
him
to
the
lodgings
of
that
gentleman
whom
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
at
home
being
favoured
with
a
private
audience
when
i
tell
you
said
he
that
my
name
is
renaldo
count
de
melvil
you
will
know
me
to
be
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
by
that
letter
which
you
committed
to
the
charge
of
my
worthy
friend
joshua
the
fatal
veil
was
removed
from
my
eyes
which
had
been
so
long
darkened
by
the
artifices
of
incredible
deceit
and
my
own
incurable
misery
fully
presented
to
my
view
if
you
were
acquainted
with
the
unhappy
fair
who
hath
fallen
a
victim
to
my
mistake
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
insufferable
pangs
which
i
now
feel
in
recollecting
her
fate
if
you
have
compassion
for
these
pangs
you
will
not
refuse
to
conduct
me
to
the
spot
where
the
dear
remains
of
monimia
are
deposited
there
let
me
enjoy
a
full
banquet
of
woe
there
let
me
feast
that
worm
of
sorrow
that
preys
upon
my
heart
for
such
entertainment
have
i
revisited
this
to
me
isle
for
this
satisfaction
i
intrude
upon
your
condescension
at
these
unseasonable
hours
for
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
is
my
affliction
whetted
that
no
slumber
shall
assail
mine
eyelids
no
peace
reside
within
my
bosom
until
i
shall
have
adored
that
earthly
shrine
where
my
monimia
lies
yet
would
i
know
the
circumstances
of
her
fate
did
heaven
ordain
no
angel
to
minister
to
her
distress
were
her
last
moments
comfortless
ha
was
not
she
abandoned
to
indigence
to
insults
left
in
the
power
of
that
inhuman
villain
who
betrayed
us
both
sacred
heaven
why
did
providence
wink
at
the
triumph
of
such
consummate
perfidy
the
physician
having
listened
with
complacency
to
this
effusion
replied
it
is
my
profession
it
is
my
nature
to
sympathise
with
the
afflicted
i
am
a
judge
of
your
feelings
because
i
know
the
value
of
your
loss
i
attended
the
incomparable
monimia
in
her
last
illness
and
am
well
enough
acquainted
with
her
story
to
conclude
that
she
fell
a
sacrifice
to
an
unhappy
misunderstanding
effected
and
fomented
by
that
traitor
who
abused
your
mutual
confidence
he
then
proceeded
to
inform
him
of
all
the
particulars
which
we
have
already
recorded
touching
the
destiny
of
the
beauteous
orphan
and
concluded
with
telling
him
he
was
ready
to
yield
him
any
other
satisfaction
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
grant
the
circumstances
of
the
tale
had
put
renaldo
spirits
into
such
commotion
that
he
could
utter
nothing
but
interjections
and
unconnected
words
when
behaviour
was
described
he
trembled
with
fierce
agitation
started
from
his
chair
pronouncing
monster
fiend
but
we
shall
one
day
meet
when
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
benevolence
of
the
french
lady
he
exclaimed
o
charity
and
compassion
sure
that
must
be
some
spirit
of
grace
sent
hither
to
mitigate
the
tortures
of
life
where
shall
i
find
her
to
offer
up
my
thanks
and
adoration
having
heard
the
conclusion
of
the
detail
he
embraced
the
relater
as
the
kind
benefactor
of
monimia
shed
a
flood
of
tears
in
his
bosom
and
pressed
him
to
crown
the
obligation
by
conducting
him
to
the
solitary
place
where
now
she
rested
from
all
her
cares
the
gentleman
perceiving
the
transports
of
his
grief
were
such
as
could
not
be
opposed
complied
with
his
request
attended
him
in
the
vehicle
and
directed
the
coachman
to
drive
to
a
sequestered
field
at
some
distance
from
the
city
where
stood
the
church
within
whose
awful
aisle
this
scene
was
to
be
acted
the
sexton
being
summoned
from
his
bed
produced
the
keys
in
consequence
of
a
gratification
after
the
physician
had
communed
with
him
apart
and
explained
the
intention
of
visit
during
this
pause
the
soul
of
melvil
was
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiastic
sorrow
the
uncommon
darkness
of
the
night
the
solemn
silence
and
lonely
situation
of
the
place
conspired
with
the
occasion
of
his
coming
and
the
dismal
images
of
his
fancy
to
produce
a
real
rapture
of
gloomy
expectation
which
the
whole
world
would
not
have
persuaded
him
to
disappoint
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
owl
screeched
from
the
ruined
battlement
the
door
was
opened
by
the
sexton
who
by
the
light
of
a
glimmering
taper
conducted
the
despairing
lover
to
a
dreary
aisle
and
stamped
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
saying
here
the
young
lady
lies
interred
melvil
no
sooner
received
this
intimation
than
falling
on
his
knees
and
pressing
his
lips
to
the
hallowed
earth
peace
cried
he
to
the
gentle
tenant
of
this
silent
habitation
then
turning
to
the
bystanders
with
a
bloodshot
eye
said
leave
me
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
this
occasion
my
grief
is
too
delicate
to
admit
the
company
even
of
my
friends
the
rites
to
be
performed
require
privacy
adieu
then
here
must
i
pass
the
night
alone
the
doctor
alarmed
at
this
declaration
which
he
was
afraid
imported
some
resolution
fatal
to
his
own
life
began
to
repent
of
having
been
accessory
to
the
visit
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
and
finding
him
obstinately
determined
called
in
the
assistance
of
the
sexton
and
coachman
and
solicited
the
aid
of
don
diego
to
force
renaldo
from
the
execution
of
his
design
the
castilian
knowing
his
friend
was
then
very
unfit
for
common
altercation
interposed
in
the
dispute
saying
you
need
not
be
afraid
that
he
will
obey
the
dictates
of
despair
his
religion
his
honour
will
baffle
such
temptations
he
hath
promised
to
reserve
his
life
for
the
occasions
of
his
friend
and
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
his
present
aim
in
order
to
corroborate
this
peremptory
address
which
was
delivered
in
the
french
language
he
unsheathed
his
sword
and
the
others
retreating
at
sight
of
his
weapon
count
said
he
enjoy
your
grief
in
full
transport
i
will
screen
you
from
interruption
though
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
and
while
you
give
a
loose
to
sorrow
within
the
ghastly
vault
i
will
watch
till
morning
in
the
porch
and
meditate
upon
the
ruin
of
my
own
family
and
peace
he
accordingly
prevailed
upon
the
physician
to
retire
after
he
had
satisfied
the
sexton
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
return
by
break
of
day
renaldo
thus
left
alone
prostrated
himself
upon
the
grave
and
poured
forth
such
lamentations
as
would
have
drawn
tears
from
the
most
savage
hearer
he
called
aloud
upon
monimia
name
are
these
the
nuptial
joys
to
which
our
fate
hath
doomed
us
is
this
the
fruit
of
those
endearing
hopes
that
intercourse
divine
that
raptured
admiration
in
which
so
many
hours
insensibly
elapsed
where
now
are
those
attractions
to
which
i
yielded
up
my
captive
heart
quenched
are
those
genial
eyes
that
gladdened
each
beholder
and
shone
the
planets
of
my
happiness
and
peace
cold
cold
and
withered
are
those
lips
that
swelled
with
love
and
far
outblushed
the
damask
rose
and
ah
forever
silenced
is
that
tongue
whose
eloquence
had
power
to
lull
the
pangs
of
misery
and
care
no
more
shall
my
attention
be
ravished
with
the
music
of
that
voice
which
used
to
thrill
in
soft
vibrations
to
my
soul
o
sainted
spirit
o
unspotted
shade
of
her
whom
i
adored
of
her
whose
memory
i
shall
still
revere
with
sorrow
and
regret
of
her
whose
image
will
be
the
last
idea
that
forsakes
this
hapless
bosom
now
art
thou
conscious
of
my
integrity
and
love
now
dost
thou
behold
the
anguish
that
i
feel
if
the
pure
essence
of
thy
nature
will
permit
wilt
thou
ah
wilt
thou
indulge
this
wretched
youth
with
some
kind
signal
of
thy
notice
with
some
token
of
thy
approbation
wilt
thou
assume
a
medium
of
embodied
air
in
semblance
of
that
lovely
form
which
now
lies
mouldering
in
this
dreary
tomb
and
speak
the
words
of
peace
to
my
distempered
soul
return
monimia
appear
though
but
for
one
short
moment
to
my
longing
eyes
vouchsafe
one
smile
renaldo
will
be
satisfied
renaldo
heart
will
be
at
rest
his
grief
no
more
will
overflow
its
banks
but
glide
with
equal
current
to
his
latest
hour
alas
these
are
the
raving
of
my
delirious
sorrow
monimia
hears
not
my
complaints
her
soul
sublimed
far
far
above
all
sublunary
cares
enjoys
that
felicity
of
which
she
was
debarred
on
earth
in
vain
i
stretch
these
eyes
environed
with
darkness
undistinguishing
and
void
no
object
meets
my
view
no
sound
salutes
mine
ear
except
the
noisy
wind
that
whistles
through
these
vaulted
caves
of
death
in
this
kind
of
exclamation
did
renaldo
pass
the
night
not
without
a
certain
species
of
woful
enjoyment
which
the
soul
is
often
able
to
conjure
up
from
the
depths
of
distress
insomuch
that
when
the
morning
intruded
on
his
privacy
he
could
scarce
believe
it
was
the
light
of
day
so
fast
had
fleeted
the
minutes
of
his
devotion
his
heart
being
thus
disburdened
and
his
impatience
gratified
he
became
so
calm
and
composed
that
don
diego
was
equally
pleased
and
astonished
at
the
air
of
serenity
with
which
he
came
forth
and
embraced
him
with
warm
acknowledgments
of
his
goodness
and
attachment
he
frankly
owned
that
his
mind
was
now
more
at
ease
than
he
had
ever
found
it
since
he
first
received
the
fatal
intimation
of
his
loss
that
a
few
such
feasts
would
entirely
moderate
the
keen
appetite
of
his
sorrow
which
he
would
afterwards
feed
with
less
precipitation
he
also
imparted
to
the
castilian
the
plan
of
a
monument
which
he
had
designed
for
the
incomparable
monimia
and
don
diego
was
so
much
struck
with
the
description
that
he
solicited
his
advice
in
projecting
another
of
a
different
nature
to
be
erected
to
the
memory
of
his
own
wife
and
daughter
should
he
ever
be
able
to
himself
in
spain
chapter
he
renews
the
rites
of
sorrow
and
is
entranced
while
they
amused
themselves
with
this
sort
of
conversation
the
physician
returned
with
the
coach
and
accompanied
them
back
to
their
inn
where
he
left
them
to
their
repose
after
having
promised
to
call
again
at
noon
and
conduct
renaldo
to
the
house
of
madam
clement
the
benefactress
of
monimia
to
whom
he
eagerly
desired
to
be
introduced
the
appointment
was
observed
with
all
imaginable
punctuality
on
both
sides
melvil
had
arrayed
himself
in
a
suit
of
deep
mourning
and
he
found
the
good
lady
in
the
like
habit
assumed
upon
the
same
occasion
the
goodness
of
her
heart
was
manifest
in
her
countenance
the
sensibility
of
the
youth
discovered
itself
in
a
flood
of
tears
which
he
shed
at
her
appearance
his
sensations
were
too
full
for
utterance
nor
was
she
for
some
time
able
to
give
him
welcome
while
she
led
him
by
the
hand
to
a
seat
the
drops
of
sympathy
rushed
into
either
eye
and
at
length
she
broke
silence
saying
count
we
must
acquiesce
in
the
dispensations
of
providence
and
quiet
the
transports
of
our
grief
with
a
full
assurance
that
monimia
is
happy
this
name
was
the
key
that
unlocked
the
faculty
of
his
speech
i
must
strive
said
he
to
ease
the
anguish
of
my
heart
with
that
consolation
but
say
humane
benevolent
lady
to
whose
compassion
and
generosity
that
hapless
orphan
was
indebted
for
the
last
peaceful
moment
she
enjoyed
upon
earth
say
in
all
your
acquaintance
with
human
nature
in
all
your
intercourse
with
the
daughters
of
men
in
all
the
exercise
of
your
charity
and
beneficence
did
you
ever
observe
such
sweetness
purity
and
truth
such
beauty
sense
and
perfection
as
that
which
was
the
inheritance
of
her
whose
fate
i
shall
for
ever
deplore
she
was
indeed
replied
the
lady
the
best
and
fairest
of
our
sex
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
conversation
touching
that
lovely
victim
in
the
course
of
which
he
explained
those
wicked
arts
which
fathom
practised
to
alienate
his
affections
from
the
adorable
monimia
and
she
described
the
cunning
hints
and
false
insinuations
by
which
that
traitor
had
aspersed
the
unsuspecting
lover
and
soiled
his
character
in
the
opinion
of
the
virtuous
orphan
the
intelligence
he
obtained
on
this
occasion
added
indignation
to
his
grief
the
whole
mystery
of
behaviour
which
he
could
not
before
explain
now
stood
disclosed
before
him
he
saw
the
gradual
progress
of
that
infernal
plan
which
had
been
laid
for
their
mutual
ruin
and
his
soul
was
inflamed
with
such
desire
of
vengeance
that
he
would
have
taken
his
leave
abruptly
in
order
to
set
on
foot
an
immediate
inquiry
about
the
perfidious
author
of
his
wrongs
that
he
might
exterminate
such
a
monster
of
iniquity
from
the
face
of
the
earth
but
he
was
restrained
by
madam
clement
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
fathom
was
already
overtaken
by
the
vengeance
of
heaven
for
she
had
traced
him
in
all
the
course
of
his
fortune
from
his
first
appearance
in
the
medical
sphere
to
his
total
eclipse
she
represented
the
villain
as
a
wretch
altogether
unworthy
of
his
attention
she
said
he
was
so
covered
with
infamy
that
no
person
could
enter
the
lists
against
him
without
bearing
away
some
stain
of
dishonour
that
he
was
at
present
peculiarly
protected
by
the
law
and
sheltered
from
the
resentment
of
renaldo
in
the
cavern
of
his
disgrace
melvil
glowing
with
rage
replied
that
he
was
a
venomous
serpent
which
it
was
incumbent
on
every
foot
to
crush
that
it
was
the
duty
of
every
man
to
contribute
his
whole
power
in
freeing
society
from
such
a
pernicious
hypocrite
and
that
if
such
instances
of
perfidy
and
ingratitude
were
suffered
to
pass
with
impunity
virtue
and
would
soon
be
expelled
from
the
habitations
of
men
over
and
above
these
motives
said
he
i
own
myself
so
vitiated
with
the
alloy
of
human
passion
and
infirmity
that
i
desire
i
eagerly
pant
for
an
occasion
of
meeting
him
hand
to
hand
where
i
may
upbraid
him
with
his
treachery
and
shower
down
vengeance
and
destruction
on
his
perfidious
head
then
he
recounted
the
anecdotes
of
our
adventurer
which
he
had
learned
in
germany
and
flanders
and
concluded
with
declaring
his
unalterable
resolution
of
releasing
him
from
jail
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
sacrificing
him
with
his
own
hand
to
the
manes
of
monimia
the
discreet
lady
perceiving
the
perturbation
of
his
mind
would
not
further
combat
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
contenting
herself
with
exacting
a
promise
that
he
would
not
execute
his
purpose
until
he
should
have
deliberated
three
days
upon
the
consequences
by
which
a
step
of
that
kind
might
be
attended
before
the
expiration
of
that
term
she
thought
measures
might
be
taken
to
prevent
the
young
gentleman
from
exposing
his
life
or
reputation
to
unnecessary
hazard
having
complied
with
her
request
in
this
particular
he
took
his
leave
after
he
had
by
repeated
entreaties
prevailed
upon
her
to
accept
a
jewel
in
token
of
his
veneration
for
the
kind
benefactress
of
the
deceased
monimia
nor
could
his
generous
heart
be
satisfied
until
he
had
forced
a
considerable
present
on
the
humane
physician
who
had
attended
her
in
her
last
moments
and
now
discovered
a
particular
sympathy
and
concern
for
her
desponding
lover
this
gentleman
attended
him
to
the
house
of
the
benevolent
joshua
where
they
dined
and
where
don
diego
was
recommended
in
the
most
fervid
terms
of
friendship
to
the
good
offices
of
their
host
not
that
this
duty
was
performed
in
presence
of
the
stranger
renaldo
delicacy
would
not
expose
his
friend
to
such
a
situation
while
the
physician
before
dinner
entertained
that
stranger
in
one
apartment
melvil
withdrew
into
another
with
the
jew
to
whom
he
disclosed
the
affair
of
the
castilian
with
certain
circumstances
which
shall
in
due
time
be
revealed
joshua
curiosity
being
whetted
by
this
information
he
could
not
help
eyeing
the
spaniard
at
table
with
such
a
particular
stare
that
don
diego
perceived
his
attention
and
took
umbrage
at
the
freedom
of
his
regard
being
unable
to
conceal
his
displeasure
he
addressed
himself
to
the
hebrew
with
great
solemnity
in
the
spanish
tongue
saving
signior
is
there
any
singularity
in
my
appearance
or
do
you
recollect
the
features
of
don
diego
de
zelos
signior
don
diego
replied
the
other
in
pure
castilian
i
crave
your
pardon
for
the
rudeness
of
my
curiosity
which
prompted
me
to
survey
a
nobleman
whose
character
i
revere
and
to
whose
misfortunes
i
am
no
stranger
indeed
were
curiosity
alone
concerned
i
should
be
without
excuse
but
as
i
am
heartily
inclined
to
serve
you
as
far
as
my
weak
abilities
extend
i
hope
your
generosity
will
not
impute
any
little
involuntary
trespass
of
punctilio
to
my
want
of
cordiality
or
esteem
the
spaniard
was
not
only
appeased
by
this
apology
but
also
affected
with
the
compliment
and
the
language
in
which
it
was
conveyed
he
thanked
the
jew
for
his
kind
declaration
entreated
him
to
bear
with
the
peevishness
of
a
disposition
sore
with
the
galling
hand
of
affliction
and
turning
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
were
it
possible
cried
he
for
fate
to
reconcile
contradictions
and
recall
the
irremediable
current
of
events
i
would
now
believe
that
there
was
happiness
still
in
reserve
for
the
forlorn
zelos
now
that
i
tread
the
land
of
freedom
and
humanity
now
that
i
find
myself
befriended
by
the
most
generous
of
men
alas
i
ask
not
happiness
if
by
the
kind
endeavours
of
the
gallant
count
de
melvil
to
whom
i
am
already
indebted
for
my
life
and
by
the
efforts
of
his
friends
the
honour
of
my
name
shall
be
purified
and
cleared
from
the
poisonous
stains
of
malice
by
which
it
is
at
present
spotted
i
shall
then
enjoy
all
that
satisfaction
which
destiny
can
bestow
upon
a
wretch
whose
woes
are
incurable
renaldo
comforted
him
with
the
assurance
of
his
being
on
the
eve
of
triumphing
over
his
adversaries
and
joshua
confirmed
the
consolation
by
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
had
correspondents
in
spain
of
some
influence
in
the
state
that
he
had
already
written
to
them
on
the
subject
of
don
diego
in
consequence
of
a
letter
which
he
had
received
from
melvil
while
he
tarried
at
mons
and
that
he
every
post
expected
a
favourable
answer
on
that
subject
after
dinner
the
physician
took
his
leave
though
not
before
he
had
promised
to
meet
renaldo
at
night
and
accompany
him
in
the
repetition
of
his
midnight
visit
to
monimia
tomb
for
this
pilgrimage
the
unfortunate
youth
resolved
nightly
to
perform
during
the
whole
time
of
his
residence
in
england
it
was
indeed
a
sort
of
pleasure
the
prospect
of
which
enabled
him
to
bear
the
toil
of
living
through
the
day
though
his
patience
was
almost
quite
exhausted
before
the
hour
of
assignation
arrived
when
the
doctor
appeared
with
the
coach
he
leaped
into
it
with
great
eagerness
after
he
had
with
much
difficulty
prevailed
with
don
diego
to
stay
at
home
on
account
of
his
health
which
was
not
yet
perfectly
established
the
castilian
however
would
not
comply
with
his
request
until
he
had
obtained
the
count
promise
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
accompany
him
next
night
and
take
that
duty
alternately
with
the
physician
about
midnight
they
reached
the
place
where
they
found
the
sexton
in
waiting
according
to
the
orders
he
had
received
the
door
was
opened
the
mourner
conducted
to
the
tomb
and
left
as
before
to
the
gloom
of
his
own
meditations
again
he
laid
himself
on
the
cold
ground
again
he
renewed
his
lamentable
strain
his
imagination
began
to
be
heated
into
an
ecstasy
of
enthusiasm
during
which
he
again
fervently
invoked
the
spirit
of
his
deceased
monimia
in
the
midst
of
these
invocations
his
ear
was
suddenly
invaded
with
the
sound
of
some
few
solemn
notes
issuing
from
the
organ
which
seemed
to
feel
the
impulse
of
an
invisible
hand
at
this
awful
salutation
melvil
was
roused
to
the
keenest
sense
of
surprise
and
attention
reason
shrunk
before
the
thronging
ideas
of
his
fancy
which
represented
this
music
as
the
prelude
to
something
strange
and
supernatural
and
while
he
waited
for
the
sequel
the
place
was
suddenly
illuminated
and
each
surrounding
object
brought
under
the
cognisance
of
his
eye
what
passed
within
his
mind
on
this
occasion
is
not
easy
to
be
described
all
his
faculties
were
swallowed
up
by
those
of
seeing
and
hearing
he
had
mechanically
raised
himself
upon
one
knee
with
his
body
advancing
forwards
and
in
this
attitude
he
gazed
with
a
look
through
which
his
soul
seemed
eager
to
escape
to
his
view
thus
strained
upon
vacant
space
in
a
few
minutes
appeared
the
figure
of
a
woman
arrayed
in
white
with
a
veil
that
covered
her
face
and
flowed
down
upon
her
back
and
shoulders
the
phantom
approached
him
with
an
easy
step
and
lifting
up
her
veil
discovered
believe
it
o
reader
the
individual
countenance
of
monimia
at
sight
of
these
features
seemingly
improved
with
new
celestial
graces
the
youth
became
a
statue
expressing
amazement
love
and
awful
adoration
he
saw
the
apparition
smile
with
meek
benevolence
divine
compassion
warm
and
intendered
by
that
fond
pure
flame
which
death
could
not
extinguish
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
monimia
call
renaldo
thrice
he
essayed
to
answer
as
oft
his
tongue
denied
its
office
his
hair
stood
upright
and
a
cold
vapour
seemed
to
thrill
through
every
nerve
this
was
not
fear
but
the
infirmity
of
human
nature
oppressed
by
the
presence
of
a
superior
being
at
length
his
agony
was
overcome
he
recollected
all
his
resolution
and
in
a
strain
of
awestruck
rapture
thus
addressed
the
heavenly
visitant
hast
thou
then
heard
pure
spirit
the
wailings
of
my
grief
hast
thou
descended
from
the
realms
of
bliss
in
pity
to
my
woe
and
art
thou
come
to
speak
the
words
of
peace
to
my
desponding
soul
to
bid
the
wretched
smile
to
lift
the
load
of
misery
and
care
from
the
afflicted
breast
to
fill
thy
lover
heart
with
joy
and
pleasing
hope
was
still
the
darling
task
of
my
monimia
ere
yet
refined
to
that
perfection
which
mortality
can
never
attain
no
wonder
then
blessed
shade
that
now
when
reunited
to
thy
native
heaven
thou
art
still
kind
propitious
and
beneficent
to
us
who
groan
in
this
inhospitable
vale
of
sorrow
thou
hast
left
tell
me
ah
tell
me
dost
thou
still
remember
those
fond
hours
we
passed
together
doth
that
enlightened
bosom
feel
a
pang
of
soft
regret
when
thou
recallest
our
fatal
separation
sure
that
meekened
glance
bespeaks
thy
sympathy
ah
how
that
tender
look
me
sacred
heaven
the
pearly
drops
of
pity
trickle
down
thy
cheeks
such
are
the
tears
that
angels
shed
man
distress
turn
not
away
thou
beckonest
me
to
follow
yes
i
will
follow
thee
ethereal
spirit
as
far
as
these
weak
limbs
encumbered
with
mortality
will
bear
my
weight
and
would
to
heaven
i
could
with
ease
put
off
these
vile
corporeal
shackles
and
attend
thy
flight
so
saying
he
started
from
the
ground
and
in
a
transport
of
eager
expectation
at
awful
distance
traced
the
footsteps
of
the
apparition
which
entering
a
detached
apartment
sunk
down
upon
a
chair
and
with
a
sigh
exclaimed
indeed
this
is
too
much
what
was
the
disorder
of
renaldo
mind
when
he
perceived
this
phenomenon
before
reflection
could
perform
its
office
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
sprung
forwards
crying
if
it
be
death
to
touch
thee
let
me
die
and
caught
in
his
arms
not
the
shadow
but
the
warm
substance
of
the
monimia
mysterious
powers
of
providence
this
is
no
phantom
this
is
no
shade
this
is
the
life
the
panting
bosom
of
her
whom
i
have
so
long
so
bitterly
deplored
i
fold
her
in
my
arms
i
press
her
glowing
breast
to
mine
i
see
her
blush
with
virtuous
pleasure
and
ingenuous
love
she
smiles
upon
me
with
enchanting
tenderness
o
let
me
gaze
on
that
transcendent
beauty
which
the
more
i
view
it
ravishes
the
more
these
charms
are
too
intense
i
sicken
while
i
gaze
merciful
heaven
is
not
this
a
mere
illusion
of
the
brain
was
she
not
fled
for
ever
had
not
the
cold
hand
of
death
divorced
her
from
my
hope
this
must
be
some
flattering
vision
of
my
distempered
fancy
perhaps
some
soothing
dream
if
such
it
be
grant
o
ye
heavenly
powers
that
i
may
never
wake
o
gentle
youth
replied
the
beauteous
orphan
still
clasped
in
his
embrace
what
joy
now
fills
the
bosom
of
monimia
at
this
triumph
of
thy
virtue
and
thy
love
when
i
see
these
transports
of
thy
affection
when
i
find
thee
restored
to
that
place
in
my
esteem
and
admiration
which
thou
hadst
lost
by
the
arts
of
calumny
and
malice
this
is
a
meeting
which
my
most
sanguine
hopes
durst
not
presage
so
entirely
were
the
faculties
of
renaldo
engrossed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
restored
monimia
that
he
saw
not
the
rest
of
the
company
who
wept
with
transport
over
this
affecting
scene
he
was
therefore
amazed
at
the
interposition
of
madam
clement
who
while
the
shower
of
sympathetic
pleasure
bedewed
her
cheeks
congratulated
the
lovers
upon
this
happy
event
crying
these
are
the
joys
which
virtue
calls
her
own
they
also
received
the
compliments
of
a
reverend
clergyman
who
told
monimia
she
had
reaped
at
last
the
fruits
of
that
pious
resignation
to
the
will
of
heaven
which
she
had
so
devoutly
practised
during
the
term
of
her
affliction
and
lastly
they
were
accosted
by
the
physician
who
was
not
quite
so
hackneyed
in
the
ways
of
death
or
so
callous
to
the
finer
sensations
of
the
soul
but
that
he
blubbered
plentifully
wile
he
petitioned
heaven
in
behalf
of
such
an
accomplished
and
deserving
pair
monimia
taking
madam
clement
by
the
hand
whatever
joy
said
she
renaldo
derives
from
this
occasion
is
owing
to
the
bounty
the
compassion
and
maternal
care
of
this
incomparable
lady
together
with
the
kind
admonitions
and
humanity
of
those
two
worthy
gentlemen
melvil
whose
passions
were
still
in
agitation
and
whose
mind
could
not
yet
digest
the
incidents
that
occurred
embraced
them
all
by
turns
but
like
the
faithful
needle
which
though
shaken
for
an
instant
from
its
poise
immediately
regains
its
true
direction
and
points
invariably
to
the
pole
he
soon
returned
to
his
monimia
again
he
held
her
in
his
arms
again
he
drank
enchantment
from
her
eyes
and
thus
poured
forth
the
effusions
of
his
soul
can
i
then
trust
the
evidence
of
sense
and
art
thou
really
to
my
wish
restored
never
o
never
did
thy
beauty
shine
with
such
bewitching
grace
as
that
which
now
confounds
and
captivates
my
view
sure
there
is
something
more
than
mortal
in
thy
looks
where
hast
thou
lived
where
borrowed
this
perfection
whence
art
thou
now
descended
oh
i
am
all
amazement
joy
and
fear
thou
wilt
not
leave
me
no
we
must
not
part
again
by
this
warm
kiss
a
thousand
times
more
sweet
than
all
the
fragrance
of
the
east
we
nevermore
will
part
o
this
is
rapture
ecstasy
and
what
no
language
can
explain
in
the
midst
of
these
ejaculations
he
ravished
a
banquet
from
her
glowing
lips
that
kindled
in
his
heart
a
flame
which
rushed
through
every
vein
and
glided
to
his
marrow
this
was
a
privilege
he
had
never
claimed
before
and
now
permitted
as
a
recompense
for
all
the
penance
he
had
suffered
nevertheless
the
cheeks
of
monimia
who
was
altogether
unaccustomed
to
such
familiarities
underwent
a
total
suffusion
and
madam
clement
discreetly
relieved
her
from
the
anxiety
of
her
situation
by
interfering
in
the
discourse
and
rallying
the
count
upon
his
endeavours
to
monopolise
such
a
branch
of
happiness
o
my
dear
lady
replied
renaldo
who
by
this
time
had
in
some
measure
recovered
his
recollection
forgive
the
wild
transports
of
a
fond
lover
who
hath
so
unexpectedly
retrieved
the
jewel
of
his
soul
yet
far
from
wishing
to
hoard
up
his
treasure
he
means
to
communicate
and
diffuse
his
happiness
to
all
his
friends
o
my
monimia
how
will
the
pleasure
of
this
hour
be
propagated
as
yet
thou
knowest
not
all
the
bliss
that
is
reserved
for
thy
enjoyment
meanwhile
i
long
to
learn
by
what
contrivance
this
happy
interview
hath
been
effected
still
am
i
ignorant
how
i
was
transported
into
this
apartment
from
the
lonely
vault
in
which
i
mourned
over
my
supposed
misfortune
chapter
the
mystery
unfolded
another
recognition
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
reader
could
not
foresee
the
french
lady
then
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
monimia
death
as
a
stratagem
she
had
concerted
with
the
clergyman
and
doctor
in
order
to
defeat
the
pernicious
designs
of
fathom
who
seemed
determined
to
support
his
false
pretensions
by
dint
of
perjury
and
fraud
which
they
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
elude
she
observed
that
the
physician
had
actually
despaired
of
monimia
life
and
it
was
not
till
after
she
herself
was
made
acquainted
with
the
prognostic
that
she
wrote
the
letter
to
renaldo
which
she
committed
to
the
care
of
madam
clement
with
an
earnest
entreaty
that
it
should
not
be
sent
till
after
her
decease
but
that
lady
believing
the
count
had
been
certainly
abused
by
his
treacherous
confidant
despatched
the
billet
without
the
knowledge
of
monimia
whose
health
was
restored
by
the
indefatigable
care
of
the
physician
and
the
sage
exhortations
of
the
clergyman
by
which
she
was
reconciled
to
life
in
a
word
the
villany
of
fathom
had
inspired
her
with
some
faint
hope
that
renaldo
might
still
be
innocent
and
that
notion
contributed
not
a
little
to
her
cure
the
letter
having
so
effectually
answered
their
warmest
hopes
in
bringing
back
renaldo
such
a
pattern
of
constancy
and
love
the
confederates
in
consequence
of
his
enthusiastic
sorrow
had
planned
this
meeting
as
the
most
interesting
way
of
restoring
two
virtuous
lovers
to
the
arms
of
each
other
for
which
purpose
the
good
clergyman
had
pitched
upon
his
own
church
and
indulged
them
with
the
use
of
the
vestry
in
which
they
now
were
presented
with
a
small
but
elegant
collation
melvil
heard
this
succinct
detail
with
equal
joy
and
admiration
he
poured
forth
the
dictates
of
his
gratitude
to
the
preservers
of
his
this
church
said
he
shall
henceforth
possess
a
double
share
of
my
veneration
this
holy
man
will
i
hope
finish
the
charitable
work
he
has
begun
by
tying
those
bands
of
our
happiness
which
nought
but
death
shall
have
power
to
unbind
then
turning
to
that
object
which
was
the
star
of
his
regard
do
i
not
overrate
said
he
my
interest
with
the
fair
monimia
she
made
no
verbal
reply
but
answered
by
an
emphatic
glance
more
eloquent
than
all
the
power
of
rhetoric
and
speech
this
language
which
is
universal
in
the
world
of
love
he
perfectly
well
understood
and
in
token
of
that
faculty
sealed
the
assent
which
she
had
smiled
with
a
kiss
imprinted
on
her
polished
forehead
in
order
to
dissipate
these
interesting
ideas
which
by
being
too
long
indulged
might
have
endangered
his
reason
madam
clement
entreated
him
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
detail
of
what
had
happened
to
him
in
his
last
journey
to
the
empire
and
monimia
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
in
particular
the
issue
of
his
contest
with
count
trebasi
who
she
knew
had
usurped
the
succession
of
his
father
thus
solicited
he
could
not
refuse
to
gratify
their
curiosity
and
concern
he
explained
his
obligations
to
the
benevolent
jew
related
the
steps
he
had
taken
at
vienna
for
the
recovery
of
his
inheritance
informed
them
of
his
happy
rencontre
with
his
of
his
sister
deliverance
and
marriage
of
the
danger
into
which
his
life
had
been
precipitated
by
the
news
of
monimia
death
and
lastly
of
his
adventure
with
the
banditti
in
favour
of
a
gentleman
who
he
afterwards
understood
had
been
robbed
in
the
most
base
and
barbarous
manner
by
fathom
he
likewise
to
the
astonishment
of
all
present
and
of
his
mistress
in
particular
communicated
some
circumstances
which
shall
appear
in
due
season
monimia
tender
frame
being
quite
fatigued
with
the
scene
she
had
acted
and
her
mind
overwhelmed
with
the
prosperous
tidings
she
had
heard
after
having
joined
the
congratulations
of
the
company
on
the
good
fortune
of
her
renaldo
begged
leave
to
retire
that
she
might
by
repose
recruit
her
exhausted
spirits
and
the
night
being
pretty
far
spent
she
was
conducted
by
her
lover
to
madam
clement
coach
that
stood
in
waiting
in
which
also
the
rest
of
the
company
made
shift
to
embark
and
were
carried
to
the
house
of
that
good
lady
where
after
they
were
invited
to
dine
and
melvil
entreated
to
bring
don
diego
and
the
jew
along
with
them
they
took
leave
of
one
another
and
retired
to
their
respective
lodgings
in
a
transport
of
joy
and
satisfaction
as
for
renaldo
his
rapture
was
still
mixed
with
apprehension
that
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
was
no
more
than
an
unsubstantial
vision
raised
by
some
gay
delirium
of
a
disordered
imagination
while
his
breast
underwent
those
violent
though
blissful
emotions
of
joy
and
admiration
his
friend
the
castilian
spent
the
night
in
ruminating
over
his
own
calamities
and
in
a
serious
and
severe
review
of
his
own
conduct
he
compared
his
own
behaviour
with
that
of
the
young
hungarian
and
found
himself
so
light
in
the
scale
that
he
smote
his
breast
with
violence
exclaiming
in
an
agony
of
remorse
count
melvil
has
reason
to
grieve
don
diego
to
despair
his
misfortunes
flow
from
the
villany
of
mankind
mine
are
the
fruit
of
my
own
madness
he
laments
the
loss
of
a
mistress
who
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
perfidious
arts
of
a
crafty
traitor
she
was
beautiful
virtuous
accomplished
and
affectionate
he
was
fraught
with
sensibility
and
love
doubtless
his
heart
must
have
deeply
suffered
his
behaviour
denotes
the
keenness
of
his
woe
his
eyes
are
everflowing
fountains
of
tears
his
bosom
the
habitation
of
sighs
five
hundred
leagues
hath
he
measured
in
a
pilgrimage
to
her
tomb
nightly
he
visits
the
dreary
vault
where
she
now
lies
at
rest
her
solitary
grave
is
his
couch
he
converses
with
darkness
and
the
dead
until
each
lonely
aisle
his
distress
what
would
be
his
penance
had
he
my
cause
were
he
conscious
of
having
murdered
a
beloved
wife
and
darling
daughter
ah
wretch
ah
cruel
homicide
what
had
those
dear
victims
done
to
merit
such
a
fate
were
they
not
ever
gentle
and
obedient
ever
aiming
to
give
thee
satisfaction
and
delight
say
that
serafina
was
enamoured
of
a
peasant
say
that
she
had
degenerated
from
the
honour
of
her
race
the
inclinations
are
involuntary
perhaps
that
stranger
was
her
equal
in
pedigree
and
worth
had
they
been
fairly
questioned
they
might
have
justified
at
least
excused
that
conduct
which
appeared
so
criminal
or
had
they
owned
the
offence
and
supplicated
pardon
o
barbarous
monster
that
i
am
was
all
the
husband
was
all
the
father
extinguished
in
my
heart
how
shall
my
own
errors
be
forgiven
if
i
refused
to
pardon
the
frailties
of
my
own
blood
of
those
who
are
most
dear
to
my
affection
yet
nature
pleaded
strongly
in
their
behalf
my
heart
was
bursting
while
i
dismissed
them
to
the
shades
of
death
i
was
maddened
with
revenge
i
was
guided
by
that
savage
principle
which
falsely
we
call
honour
accursed
phantom
that
assumes
the
specious
title
and
misleads
our
wretched
nation
is
it
then
honourable
to
skulk
like
an
assassin
and
plunge
the
secret
dagger
in
the
heart
of
some
unhappy
man
who
hath
incurred
my
groundless
jealousy
or
suspicion
without
indulging
him
with
that
opportunity
which
the
worst
criminal
enjoys
or
is
it
honourable
to
poison
two
defenceless
women
a
tender
wife
an
amiable
daughter
whom
even
a
frown
would
almost
have
destroyed
o
this
is
cowardice
brutality
fury
and
revenge
heaven
hath
not
mercy
to
forgive
such
execrable
guilt
who
gave
thee
power
abandoned
ruffian
over
the
lives
of
those
whom
god
hath
stationed
as
thy
fellows
of
probation
over
those
whom
he
had
sent
to
comfort
and
assist
thee
to
sweeten
all
thy
cares
and
smooth
the
rough
uneven
paths
of
life
o
i
am
doomed
to
horror
and
remorse
if
misery
can
atone
for
such
enormous
guilt
i
have
felt
it
in
the
extreme
like
an
undying
vulture
it
preys
upon
my
heart
to
sorrow
i
am
wedded
i
hug
that
teeming
consort
to
my
soul
never
ah
never
shall
we
part
for
soon
as
my
fame
shall
shine
unclouded
by
the
charge
of
treason
that
now
hangs
over
it
i
will
devote
myself
to
penitence
and
woe
a
cold
damp
pavement
shall
be
my
bed
my
raiment
shall
be
sackcloth
the
fields
shall
furnish
herbage
for
my
food
the
stream
shall
quench
my
thirst
the
minutes
shall
be
numbered
by
my
groans
the
night
be
privy
to
my
strains
of
sorrow
till
heaven
in
pity
to
my
sufferings
release
me
from
the
penance
i
endure
perhaps
the
saints
whom
i
have
murdered
will
intercede
for
my
remission
such
was
the
exercise
of
grief
in
which
the
hapless
castilian
consumed
the
night
he
had
not
yet
consigned
himself
to
rest
when
renaldo
entering
his
chamber
displayed
such
a
gleam
of
wildness
and
rapture
on
his
countenance
as
overwhelmed
him
with
amazement
for
till
that
moment
he
had
never
seen
his
visage
unobscured
with
woe
pardon
this
abrupt
intrusion
my
friend
cried
melvil
i
could
no
longer
withhold
from
your
participation
the
great
the
unexpected
turn
which
hath
this
night
dispelled
all
my
sorrows
and
restored
me
to
the
fruition
of
ineffable
joy
monimia
lives
the
fair
the
tender
the
virtuous
monimia
lives
and
smiles
upon
my
vows
this
night
i
retrieved
her
from
the
grave
i
held
her
in
these
arms
i
pressed
her
warm
delicious
lips
to
mine
oh
i
am
giddy
with
intolerable
pleasure
don
diego
was
confounded
at
this
declaration
which
he
considered
as
the
effects
of
a
disordered
brain
he
never
doubted
that
renaldo
grief
had
at
length
overpowered
his
reason
and
that
his
words
were
the
effects
of
mere
frenzy
while
he
mused
on
this
melancholy
subject
the
count
composed
his
features
and
in
a
succinct
and
detail
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
his
happiness
to
the
inexpressible
astonishment
of
the
spaniard
who
shed
tears
of
satisfaction
and
straining
the
hungarian
to
his
breast
o
my
son
said
he
you
see
what
recompense
heaven
hath
in
store
for
those
who
pursue
the
paths
of
real
virtue
those
paths
from
which
i
myself
have
been
fatally
misled
by
a
faithless
vapour
which
hath
seduced
my
steps
and
left
me
darkling
in
the
abyss
of
wretchedness
such
as
you
describe
this
happy
fair
was
once
my
serafina
rich
in
every
grace
of
mind
and
body
which
nature
could
bestow
had
it
pleased
heaven
to
bless
her
with
a
lover
like
renaldo
but
no
more
the
irrevocable
shaft
is
fled
i
will
not
taint
your
enjoyment
with
my
unavailing
sighs
melvil
assured
this
disconsolate
father
that
no
pleasure
no
avocation
should
ever
so
entirely
engross
his
mind
but
that
he
should
still
find
an
hour
for
sympathy
and
friendship
he
communicated
the
invitation
of
madam
clement
and
insisted
upon
his
compliance
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
approving
the
object
of
his
passion
i
can
refuse
nothing
to
the
request
of
count
de
melvil
replied
the
spaniard
and
it
were
ungrateful
in
me
to
decline
the
honour
you
propose
i
own
myself
inflamed
with
a
desire
of
beholding
a
young
lady
whose
perfections
i
have
seen
reflected
in
your
sorrow
my
curiosity
is
moreover
interested
on
account
of
that
humane
gentlewoman
whose
uncommon
generosity
sheltered
such
virtue
in
distress
but
my
disposition
is
infectious
and
will
i
am
afraid
hang
like
a
damp
upon
the
general
festivity
of
your
friends
melvil
would
take
no
denial
and
having
obtained
his
consent
repaired
to
the
house
of
joshua
whose
countenance
seemed
to
unbend
gradually
into
a
total
expression
of
joy
and
surprise
as
he
learned
the
circumstances
of
this
amazing
event
he
faithfully
promised
to
attend
the
count
at
the
appointed
hour
and
in
the
meantime
earnestly
exhorted
him
to
take
some
repose
in
order
to
quiet
the
agitation
of
his
spirits
which
must
have
been
violently
hurried
on
this
occasion
the
advice
was
salutary
and
renaldo
resolved
to
follow
it
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
and
laid
himself
down
but
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
he
had
undergone
sleep
refused
to
visit
his
eyelids
all
his
faculties
being
kept
in
motion
by
the
ideas
that
crowded
so
fast
upon
his
imagination
nevertheless
though
his
mind
continued
in
agitation
his
body
was
refreshed
and
he
arose
in
the
forenoon
with
more
serenity
and
vigour
than
he
had
enjoyed
for
many
months
every
moment
his
heart
throbbed
with
new
rapture
when
he
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
possessing
all
that
his
soul
held
dear
and
amiable
he
put
on
his
gayest
looks
and
apparel
insisted
upon
the
castilian
doing
the
same
honour
to
the
occasion
and
the
alteration
of
dress
produced
such
an
advantageous
change
in
the
appearance
of
don
diego
that
when
joshua
arrived
at
the
appointed
hour
he
could
scarce
recognise
his
features
and
complimented
him
very
politely
on
the
improvement
of
his
looks
true
it
is
the
spaniard
was
a
personage
of
a
very
prepossessing
mien
and
noble
deportment
and
had
not
grief
by
increasing
his
native
gravity
in
some
measure
discomposed
the
symmetry
of
his
countenance
he
would
have
passed
for
a
man
of
a
very
amiable
and
engaging
physiognomy
they
set
out
in
the
jew
coach
for
the
house
of
madam
clement
and
were
ushered
into
an
apartment
where
they
found
the
clergyman
and
physician
with
that
lady
to
whom
don
diego
and
the
hebrew
were
by
melvil
introduced
before
they
had
seated
themselves
renaldo
inquired
about
the
health
of
monimia
and
was
directed
to
the
next
room
by
madam
clement
who
permitted
him
to
go
thither
and
conduct
her
to
the
company
he
was
not
slow
of
availing
himself
of
this
permission
he
disappeared
in
an
instant
and
during
his
short
absence
don
diego
was
strangely
disturbed
the
blood
flushed
and
forsook
his
cheeks
by
turns
a
cold
vapour
seemed
to
shiver
through
his
nerves
and
at
his
breast
he
felt
uncommon
palpitation
madam
clement
observed
his
discomposure
and
kindly
inquired
into
the
cause
when
he
replied
i
have
such
an
interest
in
what
concerns
the
count
de
melvil
and
my
imagination
is
so
much
prepossessed
with
the
perfections
of
monimia
that
i
am
as
it
were
agonised
with
expectation
yet
never
did
my
curiosity
before
raise
such
tumults
as
those
that
now
agitate
my
bosom
he
had
scarce
pronounced
these
words
when
the
door
reopening
renaldo
led
in
this
mirror
of
elegance
and
beauty
at
sight
of
whom
the
israelite
countenance
was
distorted
into
a
stare
of
admiration
but
if
such
was
the
astonishment
of
joshua
what
were
the
emotions
of
the
castilian
when
in
the
beauteous
orphan
he
beheld
the
individual
features
of
his
serafina
his
feelings
are
not
to
be
described
the
fond
parent
whose
affection
shoots
even
to
a
sense
of
pain
feels
not
half
such
transport
when
he
unexpectedly
retrieves
a
darling
child
from
the
engulfing
billows
or
devouring
flame
the
hope
of
zelos
had
been
totally
extinguished
his
heart
had
been
incessantly
torn
with
anguish
and
remorse
upbraiding
him
as
the
murderer
of
serafina
his
therefore
were
the
additional
transports
of
a
father
disburdened
of
the
guilt
of
such
enormous
homicide
his
nerves
were
too
much
overpowered
by
this
sudden
recognition
to
manifest
the
sensation
of
his
soul
by
external
signs
he
started
not
nor
did
he
lift
an
hand
in
token
of
surprise
he
moved
not
from
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
but
riveting
his
eyes
to
those
of
the
lovely
phantom
remained
without
motion
until
she
approaching
with
her
lover
fell
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
exclaimed
may
i
yet
call
you
father
this
powerful
shock
aroused
his
faculties
a
cold
sweat
bedewed
his
forehead
his
knees
began
to
totter
he
dropped
upon
the
floor
and
throwing
his
arms
around
her
cried
o
nature
o
serafina
merciful
providence
thy
ways
are
past
finding
out
so
saying
he
fell
upon
her
neck
and
wept
aloud
the
tears
of
sympathetic
joy
trickled
down
her
snowy
bosom
that
heaved
with
rapture
inexpressible
renaldo
eyes
poured
forth
the
briny
stream
the
cheeks
of
madam
clement
were
not
dry
in
this
conjuncture
she
kneeled
by
serafina
kissed
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
maternal
affection
and
with
uplifted
hands
adored
the
power
that
preordained
this
blessed
event
the
clergyman
and
doctor
intimately
shared
the
general
transport
and
as
for
joshua
the
drops
of
true
benevolence
flowed
from
his
eyes
like
the
oil
on
aaron
beard
while
he
skipped
about
the
room
in
an
awkward
ecstasy
and
in
a
voice
resembling
the
hoarse
notes
of
the
tribe
cried
o
father
abraham
such
a
moving
scene
hath
not
been
acted
since
joseph
disclosed
himself
unto
his
brethren
in
egypt
don
diego
having
found
utterance
to
his
passion
proceeded
in
this
strain
o
my
dear
child
to
find
thee
thus
again
after
our
last
unhappy
parting
is
wonderful
miraculous
blessed
be
the
my
conscience
i
am
not
then
the
dire
assassin
who
sacrificed
his
wife
and
daughter
to
an
infernal
motive
falsely
titled
honour
though
i
am
more
and
more
involved
in
a
mystery
which
i
long
to
hear
explained
that
shall
be
my
task
cried
renaldo
but
first
permit
me
to
implore
your
sanction
to
my
passion
for
the
incomparable
serafina
you
already
know
our
mutual
sentiments
and
though
i
own
the
possession
of
such
inestimable
worth
and
beauty
would
be
a
recompense
that
infinitely
transcends
the
merit
i
can
plead
yet
as
it
hath
been
my
good
fortune
to
inspire
her
with
a
mutual
flame
i
hope
to
reap
from
your
indulgence
here
what
i
could
not
expect
from
my
own
desert
and
we
present
ourselves
in
hope
of
your
paternal
assent
and
benediction
were
she
more
fair
and
good
and
gentle
than
she
is
answered
the
castilian
and
to
my
partial
observation
nought
appeared
on
earth
more
beauteous
and
engaging
i
would
approve
your
title
to
her
heart
and
recommend
you
to
her
smiles
with
all
a
father
influence
and
power
yes
my
daughter
my
joy
on
this
occasion
is
infinitely
augmented
by
the
knowledge
of
those
tender
ties
of
love
that
bind
thee
to
this
amiable
youth
a
youth
to
whose
uncommon
courage
and
generosity
i
owe
my
life
and
my
subsistence
together
with
the
inexpressible
delight
that
now
revels
in
my
bosom
enjoy
my
children
the
happy
fruits
of
your
reciprocal
attachment
may
heaven
which
hath
graciously
conducted
you
through
a
labyrinth
of
perplexity
and
woe
to
this
transporting
view
of
blissful
days
indulge
you
with
that
uninterrupted
stream
of
pure
felicity
which
is
the
hope
and
ought
to
be
the
boon
of
virtue
such
as
yours
so
saying
he
joined
their
hands
and
embraced
them
with
the
most
cordial
love
and
satisfaction
which
diffused
itself
to
every
individual
of
the
company
who
fervently
invoked
the
almighty
power
in
behalf
of
this
enraptured
pair
the
tumult
of
these
emotions
having
a
little
subsided
and
the
castilian
being
seated
betwixt
renaldo
and
his
beauteous
bride
he
politely
bespoke
the
indulgence
of
madam
clement
begging
she
would
permit
him
to
demand
the
performance
of
the
count
promise
that
he
might
be
forthwith
made
acquainted
with
those
circumstances
of
his
own
fate
which
he
was
so
impatient
to
learn
the
lady
having
assured
him
that
she
and
all
the
company
would
take
pleasure
in
hearing
the
recapitulation
the
spaniard
addressing
himself
to
melvil
in
the
name
of
heaven
said
he
how
could
you
supplant
that
rival
who
fell
a
sacrifice
to
my
resentment
after
he
had
bewitched
the
heart
of
serafina
for
sure
the
affection
he
had
kindled
in
her
breast
must
have
long
survived
his
death
that
rival
replied
the
count
who
incurred
your
displeasure
was
no
other
than
renaldo
with
these
words
he
applied
to
one
eye
a
patch
of
black
silk
provided
for
the
purpose
and
turning
his
face
towards
don
diego
that
gentleman
started
with
astonishment
crying
good
heaven
the
very
countenance
of
orlando
whom
i
slew
this
is
still
more
amazing
chapter
a
retrospective
link
necessary
for
the
concatenation
of
these
memoirs
indulge
me
with
a
patient
hearing
proceeded
the
hungarian
and
all
these
riddles
soon
will
be
explained
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
seeing
foreign
countries
i
disobeyed
the
will
of
an
indulgent
father
from
whose
house
withdrawing
privately
i
set
out
for
italy
in
disguise
by
the
way
of
tyrol
visited
venice
rome
florence
and
embarking
at
naples
in
an
english
ship
arrived
at
lucar
from
whence
i
repaired
to
seville
there
in
a
few
days
was
my
curiosity
engaged
by
the
fame
of
the
fair
serafina
who
was
justly
deemed
the
most
accomplished
beauty
in
that
part
of
spain
nay
blush
not
gentle
creature
for
by
my
hopes
of
heaven
thy
charms
were
even
injured
by
the
cold
applause
of
that
report
nevertheless
i
was
warmly
interested
by
the
uncommon
character
and
eagerly
longed
to
see
this
pattern
of
perfection
as
don
diego
did
not
train
her
up
in
that
restraint
to
which
the
spanish
ladies
are
subjected
i
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
at
church
and
no
person
here
present
will
i
presume
doubt
but
that
i
was
instantly
captivated
by
her
beauty
and
deportment
had
i
thought
that
don
diego
favour
was
unengaged
perhaps
i
should
have
followed
the
dictates
of
vanity
and
inexperience
and
presented
myself
in
my
own
character
among
the
crowd
of
her
professed
admirers
i
knew
her
father
had
been
an
officer
of
distinguished
rank
and
reputation
and
did
not
doubt
that
he
would
have
regarded
a
young
soldier
of
unexceptionable
pedigree
and
i
will
even
add
of
untainted
fame
nor
did
i
suppose
my
own
father
could
have
objected
against
such
an
advantageous
match
but
by
dint
of
industrious
inquiry
i
learned
that
the
divine
serafina
was
already
betrothed
to
don
manuel
de
mendoza
and
this
information
overwhelmed
me
with
despair
after
having
revolved
a
thousand
projects
for
retarding
and
preventing
that
detested
union
i
resolved
to
avail
myself
of
my
talent
for
drawing
and
professed
myself
a
master
of
that
science
in
hope
of
being
employed
by
the
father
of
serafina
who
i
knew
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
improving
his
daughter
education
accordingly
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
attract
his
notice
was
invited
to
his
house
honoured
with
his
approbation
and
furnished
with
unrestricted
opportunities
of
conversing
with
the
dear
object
of
my
love
the
passion
which
her
beauty
had
kindled
was
by
the
perfections
of
her
mind
inflamed
to
such
a
degree
of
transport
as
could
not
be
concealed
from
her
penetration
she
chanced
to
relish
my
conversation
i
gradually
acquired
her
friendship
pity
was
the
next
passion
that
she
entertained
in
my
favour
i
then
ventured
to
disclose
myself
and
the
dear
charmer
did
not
disapprove
of
my
presumption
she
and
her
mother
had
been
perplexed
with
some
religious
scruples
concerning
which
they
appealed
to
my
opinion
and
i
was
happy
enough
to
set
their
minds
at
ease
this
sort
of
intercourse
naturally
created
a
mutual
confidence
among
us
and
in
a
word
i
was
blessed
with
the
daughter
love
and
approbation
don
diego
will
pardon
these
clandestine
measures
which
we
took
from
a
full
persuasion
that
it
was
impossible
to
render
him
propitious
to
the
views
in
which
our
hearts
and
hands
were
so
deeply
interested
i
did
not
then
know
how
little
he
was
addicted
to
superstition
without
entering
into
a
detail
of
the
schemes
we
projected
to
delay
the
happiness
of
mendoza
i
shall
only
observe
that
knowing
the
fatal
day
was
at
length
unalterably
fixed
we
determined
to
elude
the
purpose
of
don
diego
by
flight
and
everything
was
actually
prepared
for
our
escape
when
the
hour
of
appointment
arrived
i
repaired
to
the
place
at
which
i
had
proposed
to
enter
the
house
and
stumbled
in
the
dark
over
the
body
of
a
man
still
warm
and
bleeding
alarmed
at
this
occurrence
i
darted
myself
through
the
window
and
rushing
to
the
apartment
of
the
ladies
immortal
powers
beheld
the
peerless
serafina
and
her
virtuous
mother
stretched
on
a
couch
and
in
all
appearance
deprived
of
life
the
company
will
easily
conceive
what
agonies
i
felt
at
such
a
spectacle
i
ran
towards
the
spot
in
a
transport
of
horror
i
clasped
my
lovely
mistress
in
my
arms
and
finding
her
still
breathing
endeavoured
but
in
vain
to
wake
her
from
the
trance
antonia
was
overwhelmed
with
the
same
lethargic
power
my
fancy
was
immediately
struck
with
the
apprehension
of
their
being
poisoned
regardless
of
my
own
situation
i
alarmed
the
family
called
for
assistance
and
requested
the
servants
to
summon
don
diego
to
the
dismal
scene
i
was
informed
that
their
master
had
rode
forth
in
manifest
confusion
and
while
i
pondered
on
this
surprising
excursion
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
entered
the
chamber
and
having
examined
the
pulses
of
the
ladies
declared
that
their
lives
were
in
no
danger
and
advised
that
they
should
be
undressed
and
conveyed
to
bed
while
their
women
were
busied
in
this
employment
i
went
into
the
attended
by
some
of
the
servants
with
lights
in
order
to
view
the
body
of
the
man
which
i
had
found
at
my
arrival
his
apparel
was
mean
his
countenance
ferocious
a
long
spado
was
buckled
to
his
thigh
and
in
his
belt
were
stuck
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
so
that
we
concluded
he
was
some
thief
who
had
waited
for
an
opportunity
and
seeing
the
casement
open
intended
to
rob
the
house
but
was
prevented
and
slain
by
don
diego
himself
whose
retreat
however
did
not
a
little
confound
our
conjecture
for
my
own
part
i
remained
all
night
in
the
house
tortured
with
fear
vexation
and
suspense
my
hope
was
altogether
disappointed
by
this
unhappy
accident
and
i
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
losing
serafina
for
ever
either
by
this
mysterious
malady
or
by
her
marriage
with
mendoza
which
i
now
despaired
of
being
able
to
defeat
the
having
waited
several
hours
for
his
lord
return
without
seeing
him
appear
thought
proper
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
don
manuel
with
an
account
of
what
had
happened
and
that
nobleman
arriving
in
the
morning
took
possession
of
the
house
about
four
in
the
afternoon
serafina
began
to
stir
and
at
five
she
and
her
mother
were
perfectly
awake
they
no
sooner
recovered
the
use
of
reflection
than
they
gave
signs
of
equal
sorrow
and
amazement
and
earnestly
called
for
isabella
who
was
privy
to
our
design
and
who
after
a
very
minute
inquiry
was
found
in
a
lone
and
solitary
chamber
where
she
had
been
confined
such
was
the
confusion
of
the
house
that
no
person
ever
dreamed
of
asking
how
i
entered
each
domestic
in
all
probability
supposing
i
had
been
introduced
by
his
fellow
so
that
i
tarried
unquestioned
on
pretence
of
concern
for
the
distress
of
a
family
in
which
i
had
been
so
generously
entertained
and
by
isabella
sent
my
respects
and
duty
to
her
ladies
she
was
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
when
after
every
other
servant
had
withdrawn
she
heard
the
lovely
serafina
exclaim
with
all
the
violence
of
grief
isabella
orlando
is
no
more
but
their
astonishment
was
still
greater
when
she
assured
them
of
my
being
alive
and
in
the
house
they
recounted
to
her
the
adventure
of
last
night
which
she
explained
by
informing
them
of
the
letters
which
don
diego
had
intercepted
and
they
immediately
concluded
that
he
had
in
the
precipitation
of
his
wrath
killed
by
mistake
the
person
who
was
found
dead
in
the
this
conjecture
alarmed
them
on
my
account
they
by
the
medium
of
isabella
conjured
me
to
leave
the
house
lest
don
diego
should
return
and
accomplish
his
resentment
and
i
was
persuaded
to
withdraw
after
i
had
settled
the
channel
of
a
correspondence
with
the
confidant
being
now
obliged
to
alter
our
measures
because
our
former
intention
was
discovered
by
don
diego
i
secured
a
retreat
for
serafina
and
her
mother
at
the
house
of
the
english
consul
in
seville
who
was
my
particular
friend
and
next
day
understanding
from
isabella
that
her
lord
had
not
yet
reappeared
and
that
don
manuel
was
very
urgent
in
his
addresses
we
concerted
an
assignation
in
the
garden
and
that
same
evening
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
convey
my
prize
to
the
asylum
i
had
prepared
for
their
reception
inexpressible
was
the
rage
of
mendoza
when
he
heard
of
their
elopement
he
raved
like
one
deprived
of
reason
swore
he
would
put
all
the
servants
of
the
family
to
the
rack
and
in
consequence
of
the
intelligence
he
obtained
by
threats
and
promises
set
on
foot
a
very
strict
inquiry
in
order
to
apprehend
the
fugitives
and
orlando
who
had
by
some
means
or
other
incurred
his
suspicion
we
eluded
his
search
by
the
vigilance
and
caution
of
our
kind
host
and
while
we
remained
in
concealment
were
extremely
astonished
to
hear
that
the
unfortunate
don
diego
was
proclaimed
a
traitor
and
a
price
set
upon
his
head
this
information
overwhelmed
us
all
with
the
utmost
affliction
antonia
lamented
without
ceasing
the
disgrace
of
her
beloved
lord
from
whom
she
never
would
have
withdrawn
herself
but
with
the
lively
hope
of
a
reconciliation
after
the
first
transports
of
his
ire
should
have
subsided
and
the
real
character
of
orlando
should
have
appeared
it
was
not
long
before
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
mendoza
was
the
accuser
of
don
diego
nay
start
not
signior
manuel
was
actually
that
traitor
this
was
the
turn
of
his
revenge
when
he
found
himself
disappointed
in
the
hope
of
possessing
the
incomparable
serafina
he
took
a
base
advantage
of
your
absence
and
retreat
he
posted
to
madrid
impeached
you
to
the
secretary
of
state
of
having
maintained
a
criminal
correspondence
with
the
enemies
of
spain
included
me
in
his
accusation
as
a
spy
for
the
house
of
austria
and
framed
such
a
plausible
tale
from
the
circumstances
of
your
distress
that
don
diego
was
outlawed
and
mendoza
gratified
with
a
grant
of
his
estate
these
melancholy
incidents
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
virtuous
antonia
who
waiving
every
other
consideration
would
have
personally
appeared
for
the
vindication
of
her
husband
honour
had
not
we
dissuaded
her
from
such
a
rash
undertaking
by
demonstrating
her
inability
to
contend
with
such
a
powerful
antagonist
and
representing
that
her
appearance
would
be
infallibly
attended
with
the
ruin
of
serafina
who
would
certainly
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
villain
to
whom
she
had
been
contracted
we
exhorted
her
to
wait
patiently
for
some
happy
revolution
of
fortune
and
encouraged
her
with
the
hope
of
don
diego
exerting
himself
effectually
in
his
own
defence
meanwhile
our
worthy
landlord
was
suddenly
cut
off
by
death
and
his
widow
being
resolved
to
retire
into
her
own
country
we
secretly
embarked
in
the
same
ship
and
arrived
in
england
about
eighteen
months
ago
antonia
still
continued
to
pine
over
the
ruin
of
her
house
as
she
could
hear
no
tidings
of
don
diego
she
concluded
he
was
dead
and
mourned
with
unabating
sorrow
in
vain
i
assured
her
that
soon
as
my
own
affairs
should
be
adjusted
i
would
exert
my
whole
endeavours
to
find
and
succour
him
she
could
not
imagine
that
a
man
of
his
spirit
and
disposition
would
live
so
long
in
obscurity
and
her
affliction
derived
new
force
from
the
death
of
the
consul
widow
with
whom
she
had
lived
in
the
most
unbounded
intimacy
and
friendship
from
that
day
her
health
evidently
declined
she
foresaw
her
dissolution
and
comforted
herself
with
the
hope
of
seeing
her
husband
and
her
friend
in
a
place
where
no
treachery
is
felt
and
no
sorrow
is
known
confident
of
my
integrity
and
the
purity
of
my
love
she
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
recommended
serafina
to
my
care
ha
weepest
thou
fair
excellence
at
the
remembrance
of
that
tender
scene
when
the
good
antonia
on
the
bed
of
death
joined
thy
soft
hand
to
mine
and
said
i
bequeath
this
orphan
to
your
love
it
is
a
sacred
pledge
which
if
you
cherish
with
due
honour
and
regard
internal
peace
and
happiness
will
ever
smile
within
your
bosom
but
if
you
treat
it
with
indifference
dishonour
or
neglect
just
heaven
will
punish
your
breach
of
trust
with
everlasting
disappointments
and
disquiet
signior
don
diego
i
see
you
are
moved
and
therefore
will
not
dwell
on
such
distressful
circumstances
the
excellent
antonia
exchanged
this
life
for
a
more
happy
state
and
so
exquisite
was
the
sorrow
of
the
serafina
as
to
torture
me
with
the
apprehension
that
she
would
not
long
survive
her
pious
mother
how
i
obeyed
the
injunctions
of
that
departing
saint
monimia
for
that
name
she
now
assumed
can
testify
until
that
artful
serpent
fathom
glided
into
our
mutual
confidence
abused
our
ears
poisoned
our
unsuspected
faith
and
effected
that
fatal
breach
productive
of
all
the
misery
and
vexation
which
we
have
suffered
and
which
is
now
so
happily
expelled
heaven
said
the
castilian
hath
visited
me
for
the
sins
and
errors
of
my
youth
yet
such
mercy
hath
been
mingled
with
its
chastisements
i
dare
not
murmur
or
repine
the
tears
of
penitence
and
sorrow
shall
water
my
antonia
grave
as
for
mendoza
i
rejoice
at
his
treachery
by
which
the
obligation
of
my
promise
is
cancelled
and
my
honour
fully
acquitted
he
shall
not
triumph
in
his
guilt
my
services
my
character
and
innocence
shall
soon
confront
his
perfidy
and
i
hope
defeat
his
interest
the
king
is
just
and
gracious
nor
is
my
family
and
name
unknown
here
the
jew
interposing
presented
to
him
a
letter
from
a
person
of
consequence
at
madrid
whom
joshua
had
interested
in
the
cause
of
don
diego
that
nobleman
had
already
found
means
to
represent
the
case
of
zelos
to
his
majesty
who
had
actually
ordered
don
manuel
to
be
confined
until
the
injured
person
should
appear
to
justify
himself
and
prosecute
his
accuser
according
to
the
terms
of
law
at
the
same
time
don
diego
was
summoned
to
present
himself
before
the
king
within
a
limited
time
to
answer
to
the
charge
which
mendoza
had
brought
against
him
the
spaniard
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
joy
when
he
read
this
intimation
he
embraced
the
jew
who
before
zelos
could
give
utterance
to
his
thoughts
told
him
that
the
spanish
ambassador
at
london
having
been
prepossessed
in
his
favour
craved
the
honour
of
seeing
don
diego
and
that
he
joshua
was
ready
to
conduct
him
to
the
house
then
is
my
heart
at
rest
cried
the
castilian
the
house
of
zelos
once
more
shall
lift
up
its
head
i
shall
again
revisit
my
native
country
with
honour
and
abase
the
villain
who
hath
soiled
my
fame
o
my
children
this
day
is
replete
with
such
joy
and
satisfaction
as
i
did
not
think
had
been
in
the
power
of
heaven
to
grant
without
the
interposition
of
a
miracle
to
you
renaldo
to
you
illustrious
lady
and
to
these
worthy
gentlemen
am
i
indebted
for
the
restoration
of
that
for
which
alone
i
wish
to
live
and
when
my
heart
ceases
to
retain
the
obligation
may
i
forfeit
the
name
of
a
castilian
and
scorn
and
dishonour
be
my
portion
perhaps
all
europe
could
not
produce
another
company
so
happy
as
that
which
now
sat
down
to
dinner
in
the
house
of
madam
clement
whose
own
benevolent
heart
was
peculiarly
adapted
for
such
enjoyment
the
lovers
feasted
their
eyes
more
than
their
appetite
by
a
tender
intercourse
of
glances
which
needed
not
the
slow
interpretation
of
speech
while
the
spaniard
regarded
them
alternately
with
looks
of
wonder
and
paternal
joy
and
every
individual
surveyed
the
pair
with
admiration
and
esteem
serafina
taking
the
advantage
of
this
general
satisfaction
when
the
heart
softened
into
complacency
deposits
every
violent
thought
i
must
now
said
she
try
my
interest
with
renaldo
the
good
company
shall
bear
witness
to
my
triumph
or
repulse
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
but
to
withhold
your
vengeance
from
the
wretched
fathom
his
fraud
ingratitude
and
villany
are
i
believe
unrivalled
yet
his
base
designs
have
been
defeated
and
heaven
perhaps
hath
made
him
the
involuntary
instrument
for
bringing
our
constancy
and
virtue
to
the
test
besides
his
perfidy
is
already
punished
with
the
last
degree
of
human
misery
and
disgrace
the
doctor
who
has
traced
him
in
all
his
conduct
and
vicissitudes
of
fortune
will
draw
a
picture
of
his
present
wretchedness
which
i
doubt
not
will
move
your
compassion
as
it
hath
already
excited
mine
the
generous
hostess
was
ready
to
enforce
this
charitable
proposal
with
all
her
eloquence
when
melvil
with
a
look
that
well
expressed
his
magnanimity
of
love
replied
such
a
boon
becomes
the
gentle
serafina
o
every
moment
furnishes
me
with
fresh
matter
to
admire
the
virtues
of
thy
soul
if
thou
whose
tender
heart
hath
been
so
rent
with
misery
and
anguish
canst
intercede
for
thy
tormentor
who
now
suffers
in
his
turn
shall
i
refuse
to
pardon
the
miserable
wretch
no
let
me
glory
in
imitating
the
great
example
and
solicit
don
diego
in
behalf
of
the
same
miscreant
whose
perfidious
barbarity
cost
him
such
intolerable
woe
enough
cried
the
castilian
i
have
disclaimed
the
vindictive
principles
of
a
spaniard
and
leave
the
miserable
object
to
the
sting
of
his
own
conscience
which
soon
or
late
will
not
fail
to
avenge
the
wrongs
we
have
sustained
from
his
deceit
chapter
the
history
draws
near
a
period
universal
was
the
applause
which
they
acquired
by
this
noble
sacrifice
of
their
resentment
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
the
utmost
harmony
and
and
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
renaldo
whose
fancy
still
harboured
the
apprehensions
of
another
separation
don
diego
consented
that
the
indissoluble
knot
should
be
tied
between
that
young
gentleman
and
serafina
in
two
days
and
the
place
appointed
for
the
ceremony
was
the
very
church
where
they
had
been
restored
to
the
arms
of
each
other
the
lovely
bride
with
a
silent
blush
that
set
her
lover
heart
on
fire
submitted
to
this
determination
in
consequence
of
which
the
company
was
bespoke
for
that
auspicious
hour
and
the
evening
being
pretty
far
advanced
they
took
leave
of
the
ladies
and
retired
to
their
respective
homes
don
diego
and
his
future
being
reconducted
to
their
lodgings
in
the
coach
of
the
jew
who
taking
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
melvil
observed
that
it
would
be
necessary
on
this
occasion
to
supply
the
castilian
with
a
sum
of
money
in
order
to
support
his
dignity
and
independence
in
furnishing
serafina
with
everything
suitable
to
her
rank
and
merit
and
that
he
would
willingly
accommodate
him
provided
he
knew
how
to
propose
it
so
as
to
give
no
offence
to
his
punctilious
disposition
renaldo
thanking
him
for
this
generous
anticipation
advised
him
to
solicit
the
spaniard
correspondence
in
the
way
of
business
and
to
put
the
whole
on
the
footing
of
his
own
interest
by
which
means
don
delicacy
could
sustain
no
affront
fraught
with
this
instruction
the
israelite
desired
a
private
audience
of
the
castilian
in
which
after
an
apology
for
the
freedom
of
his
demand
signior
don
diego
said
he
as
your
fortune
hath
been
so
long
embezzled
by
your
adversary
in
spain
and
your
correspondence
with
that
country
entirely
cut
off
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
your
finances
are
at
present
in
such
a
condition
as
to
maintain
the
splendour
of
your
family
count
de
melvil
whole
fortune
is
at
your
command
and
had
not
he
been
afraid
of
giving
umbrage
to
the
peculiar
delicacy
of
your
sentiments
he
would
have
pressed
you
to
use
it
for
your
convenience
for
my
own
part
over
and
above
the
inclination
i
have
to
serve
don
diego
i
consult
my
own
private
advantage
in
desiring
you
to
accept
my
service
on
this
occasion
money
is
the
chief
commodity
in
which
i
deal
and
if
you
honour
me
with
your
commands
i
shall
be
a
gainer
by
my
obedience
don
diego
replied
with
a
smile
that
denoted
how
well
he
understood
the
meaning
of
this
address
surely
signior
i
am
bound
by
the
strongest
ties
to
exert
my
utmost
endeavours
for
your
advantage
and
i
pray
god
this
your
proposal
may
have
that
issue
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
count
generosity
and
refined
notions
of
honour
and
too
much
obliged
by
him
already
to
hesitate
with
punctilious
reserve
in
accepting
his
future
assistance
nevertheless
since
you
have
contrived
a
scheme
for
removing
all
scruples
of
that
sort
i
shall
execute
it
with
pleasure
and
in
the
form
of
business
you
shall
have
all
the
security
i
can
give
for
what
shall
be
necessary
to
answer
my
present
occasions
the
preliminaries
being
thus
settled
joshua
advanced
for
his
use
a
thousand
pounds
for
which
he
would
take
neither
bond
note
nor
receipt
desiring
only
that
the
castilian
would
mark
it
in
his
own
that
the
debt
might
appear
in
case
any
accident
should
befall
the
borrower
although
the
spaniard
had
been
accustomed
to
the
uncommon
generosity
of
melvil
he
could
not
help
wondering
at
this
nobleness
of
behaviour
so
little
to
be
expected
from
any
merchant
much
less
from
a
jewish
broker
while
this
affair
was
on
the
anvil
renaldo
who
could
no
longer
withhold
the
communication
of
his
happiness
from
his
sister
and
relations
in
germany
took
up
the
pen
and
in
a
letter
to
his
recounted
all
the
circumstances
of
the
surprising
turn
of
fate
which
he
had
experienced
since
his
arrival
in
england
he
likewise
related
the
story
of
don
diego
informed
them
of
the
day
appointed
for
his
nuptials
and
entreated
the
major
to
make
a
journey
to
london
with
his
wife
or
if
that
should
be
impracticable
to
come
as
far
as
brussels
where
they
should
be
met
by
him
and
his
serafina
there
was
now
but
one
day
between
him
and
the
accomplishment
of
his
dearest
wish
and
that
was
spent
in
procuring
a
licence
and
adjusting
the
preparations
for
the
grand
festival
don
diego
in
the
forenoon
visited
madam
clement
to
whom
he
repeated
his
warm
acknowledgments
of
her
bounty
and
maternal
affection
to
his
daughter
and
presented
to
serafina
bank
notes
to
the
amount
of
five
hundred
pounds
to
defray
the
necessary
expense
for
her
wedding
ornaments
all
the
previous
steps
being
taken
for
the
solemnisation
of
this
interesting
event
and
the
hour
of
appointment
arrived
the
bridegroom
accompanied
by
his
hastened
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
which
was
the
of
the
church
we
have
already
described
where
they
were
received
by
the
good
clergyman
in
his
canonicals
and
here
they
had
not
waited
many
minutes
when
they
were
joined
by
madam
clement
and
the
amiable
bride
escorted
by
the
friendly
physician
who
had
all
along
borne
such
a
share
in
their
concerns
serafina
was
dressed
in
a
sack
of
white
satin
and
the
ornaments
of
her
head
were
adjusted
in
the
spanish
fashion
which
gave
a
peculiar
air
to
her
appearance
and
an
additional
spirit
to
those
attractions
which
engaged
the
heart
of
each
beholder
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
habit
of
renaldo
who
had
copied
the
plainness
and
elegance
of
his
mistress
but
when
she
entered
the
place
his
features
were
animated
with
a
double
proportion
of
vivacity
and
their
eyes
meeting
seemed
to
kindle
a
blaze
which
diffused
warmth
and
joy
through
the
countenances
of
all
present
after
a
short
pause
her
father
led
her
to
the
altar
and
gave
her
away
to
the
transported
renaldo
before
the
priest
who
performed
the
ceremony
and
bestowed
the
nuptial
benediction
on
this
enraptured
pair
the
sanction
of
the
church
being
thus
obtained
they
withdrew
into
the
vestry
where
melvil
sealed
his
title
on
her
rosy
lips
and
presented
his
wife
to
the
company
who
embraced
her
in
their
turns
with
fervent
wishes
for
their
mutual
happiness
though
the
scene
of
this
transaction
was
remote
from
any
inhabited
neighbourhood
the
church
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
people
who
with
uncommon
demonstration
of
surprise
and
admiration
petitioned
heaven
to
bless
so
fair
a
couple
such
indeed
was
their
eagerness
to
see
them
that
some
lives
were
endangered
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
which
attended
them
with
loud
acclamations
to
the
coach
after
the
bridegroom
had
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
minister
one
hundred
pounds
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
of
that
parish
and
thrown
several
handfuls
of
money
among
the
multitude
serafina
in
madam
convenience
with
that
good
lady
and
don
diego
while
renaldo
with
the
clergyman
and
doctor
followed
in
joshua
coach
to
a
pleasant
upon
the
thames
at
a
distance
of
a
few
miles
from
london
this
the
jew
had
borrowed
from
the
owner
for
a
few
days
and
there
they
were
received
by
that
honest
hebrew
who
had
provided
a
very
elegant
entertainment
for
the
occasion
he
had
also
bespoke
a
small
but
excellent
band
of
music
which
regaled
their
ears
while
they
sat
at
dinner
and
the
afternoon
being
calm
and
serene
he
prevailed
on
them
to
take
the
air
on
the
river
in
a
barge
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
purpose
but
notwithstanding
this
diversity
of
amusement
renaldo
would
have
found
it
the
longest
day
he
had
ever
passed
had
not
his
imagination
been
diverted
by
an
incident
which
employed
his
attention
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
evening
they
had
drunk
tea
and
engaged
in
a
party
at
whist
when
they
were
surprised
with
a
noise
of
contention
from
a
that
fronted
the
windows
of
the
apartment
in
which
they
sat
alarmed
at
this
uproar
they
forsook
their
cards
and
throwing
up
the
casement
beheld
a
hearse
surrounded
by
four
men
on
horseback
who
had
stopped
the
carriage
and
violently
pulled
the
driver
from
his
seat
this
uncommon
arrest
had
engaged
the
curiosity
of
the
publican
family
who
stood
at
the
door
to
observe
the
consequence
when
all
of
a
sudden
appeared
a
person
in
canonicals
well
mounted
who
riding
up
to
those
who
maltreated
the
driver
bestowed
upon
one
of
them
such
a
blow
with
the
of
his
whip
as
laid
him
sprawling
on
the
ground
and
springing
from
his
saddle
upon
the
box
took
the
reins
into
his
own
hand
swearing
with
great
vehemence
that
he
would
murder
every
man
who
should
attempt
to
obstruct
the
hearse
the
good
priest
who
had
married
renaldo
was
not
a
little
scandalised
at
this
ferocious
behaviour
in
a
clergyman
and
could
not
help
saying
aloud
he
was
a
disgrace
to
the
cloth
when
the
horseman
looking
up
to
the
window
replied
sir
may
i
be
d
n
if
any
man
in
england
has
a
greater
respect
for
the
cloth
than
i
have
but
at
present
i
am
quite
distracted
so
saying
he
whipped
up
the
horses
and
had
actually
disentangled
the
hearse
from
those
who
surrounded
it
when
he
was
opposed
by
another
troop
one
of
whom
alighted
with
great
expedition
and
cut
the
harness
so
as
that
he
could
not
possibly
proceed
finding
himself
thus
driven
to
bay
he
leaped
upon
the
ground
and
exercised
his
weapon
with
such
amazing
strength
and
agility
that
several
of
his
antagonists
were
left
motionless
on
the
field
before
he
was
overpowered
and
disarmed
by
dint
of
numbers
who
assailed
him
on
all
sides
the
mad
parson
being
thus
taken
prisoner
an
elderly
person
of
a
very
prepossessing
appearance
went
up
to
the
hearse
and
unbolting
the
door
a
young
lady
sprung
out
and
shrieking
ran
directly
to
the
to
the
infinite
astonishment
and
affright
of
the
whole
family
who
believed
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
person
whose
body
lay
in
the
carriage
renaldo
who
was
with
difficulty
restrained
from
interposing
in
behalf
of
the
clergyman
against
such
odds
no
sooner
perceived
this
apparition
than
supposing
her
to
be
some
distressed
damsel
his
quixotism
awoke
he
descended
in
an
instant
and
rushed
into
the
house
among
those
that
pursued
the
fair
phantom
don
diego
and
the
physician
took
the
same
road
while
the
real
clergyman
and
joshua
tarried
with
the
ladies
who
were
by
this
time
very
much
interested
in
the
event
melvil
found
the
young
lady
in
the
hands
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
released
her
from
the
hearse
and
who
now
bitterly
upbraided
her
for
her
folly
and
disobedience
while
she
protested
with
great
vivacity
that
whatever
she
might
suffer
from
his
severity
she
would
never
submit
to
the
hateful
match
he
had
proposed
nor
break
the
promise
she
had
already
made
to
the
gentleman
who
now
attempted
to
rescue
her
from
the
tyranny
of
a
cruel
father
this
declaration
was
followed
by
a
plentiful
shower
of
tears
which
the
father
could
not
behold
with
unmoistened
eyes
although
he
reviled
her
with
marks
of
uncommon
displeasure
and
turning
to
the
count
i
appeal
to
you
sir
said
he
whether
i
have
not
reason
to
curse
the
undutiful
obstinacy
of
that
pert
baggage
and
renounce
her
for
ever
as
an
alien
to
my
blood
she
has
for
some
months
been
solicited
in
marriage
by
an
honest
citizen
a
thirty
thousand
pound
man
and
instead
of
listening
to
such
an
advantageous
proposal
she
hath
bestowed
her
heart
upon
a
young
fellow
not
worth
a
groat
ah
you
degenerate
hussy
this
comes
of
your
plays
and
romances
if
thy
mother
were
not
a
woman
of
an
unexceptionable
life
and
conversation
i
should
verily
believe
thou
art
no
child
of
mine
run
away
with
a
beggar
for
shame
i
suppose
replied
renaldo
the
person
to
whom
your
affection
inclines
is
that
clergyman
who
exerted
himself
so
manfully
at
the
door
clergyman
cried
the
other
adad
he
has
more
of
the
devil
than
the
church
about
him
a
ruffian
he
has
for
aught
i
know
murdered
the
worthy
gentleman
whom
i
intended
for
my
and
the
rogue
if
i
had
not
kept
out
of
his
way
would
i
suppose
have
served
me
with
the
same
sauce
me
who
have
been
his
master
for
many
years
and
had
resolved
to
make
a
man
of
him
sir
he
was
my
own
clerk
and
this
is
the
return
i
have
met
with
from
the
serpent
which
i
cherished
in
my
bosom
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
citizen
for
whom
he
had
expressed
such
concern
that
gentleman
had
received
a
contusion
upon
one
eye
by
which
the
sight
was
altogether
obstructed
so
that
he
concluded
he
should
never
retrieve
the
use
of
that
organ
and
with
great
clamour
took
all
the
spectators
to
witness
the
injury
he
had
sustained
he
entered
the
room
with
manifest
perturbation
demanded
satisfaction
of
the
father
and
peremptorily
declared
it
should
not
be
a
lost
eye
to
him
if
there
was
law
in
england
this
unseasonable
demand
and
the
boisterous
manner
in
which
it
was
made
did
not
at
all
suit
the
present
humour
of
the
old
gentleman
who
told
him
peevishly
he
owed
him
no
eye
and
bade
him
go
and
ask
reparation
of
the
person
who
had
done
him
wrong
the
young
lady
snatching
this
favourable
occasion
earnestly
entreated
melvil
and
his
company
to
intercede
with
her
father
in
behalf
of
her
lover
who
she
assured
them
was
a
young
gentleman
of
a
good
family
and
uncommon
merit
and
in
compliance
with
her
request
they
invited
him
and
his
daughter
to
the
house
in
which
they
lodged
where
they
would
be
disencumbered
of
the
crowd
which
this
dispute
had
gathered
together
and
more
at
leisure
to
consult
about
the
measures
necessary
to
be
taken
the
old
gentleman
thanked
them
for
their
courtesy
which
he
did
not
think
proper
to
refuse
and
while
he
led
or
rather
hauled
mademoiselle
over
the
way
under
the
auspices
of
the
castilian
renaldo
set
the
lover
at
liberty
made
him
a
tender
of
his
good
offices
and
advised
him
to
wait
at
the
for
an
happy
issue
of
their
negotiation
the
was
very
much
affected
by
this
generous
proffer
for
which
he
made
suitable
acknowledgments
and
protested
before
god
he
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
part
with
his
dear
charlotte
her
father
no
sooner
entered
the
apartment
than
he
was
known
by
joshua
to
be
a
considerable
trader
in
the
city
of
london
and
the
merchant
was
glad
to
find
himself
among
his
acquaintance
he
was
so
full
of
the
story
which
had
brought
him
thither
that
he
had
scarce
sat
down
when
he
began
to
complain
of
his
hard
fate
in
having
an
only
child
who
was
so
mean
stubborn
and
contumacious
and
every
sentence
was
concluded
with
an
apostrophe
of
reproaches
to
the
delinquent
the
jew
having
allowed
him
to
ring
out
his
alarm
condoled
his
misfortune
and
gravely
counselled
the
young
lady
to
wean
her
affections
from
such
an
unworthy
object
for
he
supposed
her
favourite
was
a
man
of
no
principle
or
liberal
endowments
otherwise
her
father
would
not
exclaim
so
bitterly
against
her
conduct
charlotte
who
wanted
neither
beauty
nor
understanding
assured
him
that
her
lover
character
was
in
all
respects
unblemished
for
the
truth
of
which
assertion
she
appealed
to
her
papa
who
owned
with
reluctance
that
the
young
man
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
that
he
had
served
him
with
remarkable
diligence
and
integrity
and
that
his
accomplishments
were
far
superior
to
his
station
in
life
but
then
said
he
the
fellow
has
not
a
shilling
of
his
own
and
would
you
have
me
give
away
my
daughter
to
a
beggar
god
forbid
cried
the
jew
i
always
understood
you
possessed
an
ample
fortune
and
am
sorry
to
find
it
otherwise
otherwise
cried
the
citizen
with
some
acrimony
take
care
what
you
say
sir
a
credit
is
not
to
be
tampered
with
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
the
hebrew
i
concluded
that
your
circumstances
were
bad
because
you
objected
to
the
poverty
of
the
young
man
after
you
had
owned
he
was
possessed
of
every
other
qualification
to
make
your
daughter
happy
for
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
you
would
thwart
her
inclinations
or
seek
to
render
an
only
child
miserable
on
account
of
an
obstacle
which
you
yourself
could
easily
remove
let
us
suppose
you
can
afford
to
give
with
your
daughter
ten
thousand
pounds
which
would
enable
this
young
man
to
live
with
credit
and
reputation
and
engage
advantageously
in
trade
for
which
you
say
he
is
well
qualified
the
alternative
then
will
be
whether
you
would
rather
see
her
in
the
arms
of
a
deserving
youth
whom
she
loves
enjoying
all
the
comforts
of
life
with
a
moderate
fortune
which
it
will
always
be
in
your
own
power
to
improve
or
tied
for
life
to
a
monied
man
whom
she
detests
cursing
her
hard
fate
and
despising
that
superfluity
of
wealth
in
spite
of
which
she
finds
herself
so
truly
wretched
the
old
gentleman
seemed
to
be
startled
at
this
observation
which
was
reinforced
by
renaldo
saying
that
he
would
moreover
enjoy
the
unutterable
pleasure
of
giving
happiness
to
a
worthy
man
whose
gratitude
would
with
his
love
in
approving
himself
a
dutiful
son
as
well
as
an
affectionate
husband
he
then
represented
the
family
disquiets
and
dismal
tragedies
produced
from
such
mercenary
and
compulsive
matches
and
in
conclusion
related
the
story
of
don
diego
and
his
daughter
which
when
the
merchant
heard
he
started
up
with
marks
of
terror
in
his
countenance
and
throwing
up
the
casement
called
upon
valentine
with
great
vociferation
this
was
the
name
of
his
admirer
who
no
sooner
heard
the
summons
than
he
flew
to
the
spot
from
whence
it
came
and
the
merchant
without
any
further
preamble
seizing
his
hand
joined
it
with
that
of
charlotte
saying
with
great
trepidation
here
take
her
in
the
name
of
god
and
thank
this
honourable
company
for
your
good
fortune
the
lovers
were
transported
with
exquisite
joy
at
this
sudden
determination
in
their
favour
valentine
having
kissed
the
hand
of
his
mistress
with
all
the
eagerness
of
rapture
and
acknowledged
the
merchant
generosity
paid
his
respects
to
the
ladies
with
a
very
polite
address
and
with
demonstrations
of
uncommon
gratitude
and
sensibility
thanked
the
gentlemen
and
the
count
in
particular
for
their
good
offices
to
which
he
attributed
the
happiness
he
now
enjoyed
while
serafina
and
madam
clement
caressed
the
amiable
charlotte
the
rest
of
the
company
congratulated
her
admirer
upon
his
choice
and
success
though
the
clergyman
could
not
help
reprehending
him
for
profaning
the
sacerdotal
habit
valentine
heartily
asked
pardon
for
having
given
such
cause
of
offence
and
hoped
he
should
be
forgiven
as
it
was
a
disguise
which
he
thought
absolutely
necessary
for
the
execution
of
a
scheme
upon
which
his
happiness
depended
he
then
at
the
request
of
renaldo
unfolded
the
mystery
of
the
hearse
by
giving
them
to
understand
that
father
having
got
inkling
of
their
mutual
passion
had
dismissed
his
clerk
and
conveyed
his
daughter
to
a
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
in
order
to
cut
off
their
correspondence
notwithstanding
these
precautions
they
had
found
means
to
communicate
with
each
other
by
letters
which
were
managed
by
a
third
person
and
his
rival
being
very
importunate
in
his
solicitations
they
had
concerted
the
expedient
of
the
hearse
which
he
provided
and
conducted
through
a
road
contiguous
to
the
end
of
the
merchant
garden
where
charlotte
being
apprised
of
the
design
waited
for
its
approach
and
embarked
in
it
without
hesitation
valentine
thought
himself
sufficiently
screened
from
discovery
by
his
disguise
but
he
was
unfortunately
met
by
a
servant
of
the
family
who
recollected
his
features
and
immediately
gave
the
alarm
upon
which
the
father
and
his
friends
took
horse
and
pursued
them
by
two
different
roads
until
they
were
overtaken
at
this
place
he
had
scarce
finished
this
short
relation
when
his
rival
bluntly
entering
the
apartment
with
an
handkerchief
tied
round
his
eye
committed
valentine
to
the
charge
of
a
constable
who
attended
him
by
a
warrant
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
that
neighbourhood
and
threatened
to
prosecute
the
merchant
on
an
action
of
damages
for
the
loss
of
an
eye
which
he
said
he
had
sustained
in
his
service
the
company
endeavoured
to
appease
this
citizen
by
representing
that
his
misfortune
was
no
other
than
a
common
inflammation
nor
was
it
owing
to
malice
aforethought
but
entirely
to
the
precipitate
passion
of
an
incensed
young
man
who
by
the
bye
acted
in
his
own
defence
at
the
same
time
the
merchant
promised
to
make
any
reasonable
satisfaction
upon
which
the
other
demanded
an
obligation
importing
that
he
would
in
ten
days
from
the
date
bestow
upon
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
with
a
portion
of
fifteen
thousand
pounds
or
in
case
of
failure
pay
him
double
the
sum
the
merchant
exasperated
at
this
extravagant
demand
told
him
flatly
he
had
already
disposed
of
his
daughter
to
valentine
who
he
believed
was
a
much
more
deserving
man
and
that
he
was
ready
to
wait
upon
the
magistrate
who
had
granted
the
warrant
in
order
to
give
bail
for
his
future
this
was
a
mortifying
declaration
to
the
plaintiff
though
he
condoled
himself
with
the
hope
of
being
a
gainer
by
the
loss
of
his
eye
and
now
the
pain
was
over
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
find
his
sight
retrieved
the
old
gentleman
joshua
and
renaldo
accompanied
the
prisoner
to
the
house
of
the
justice
where
he
was
immediately
admitted
to
bail
upon
their
return
valentine
shifted
his
dress
and
they
supped
together
with
great
cordiality
and
mirth
maintained
at
the
expense
of
the
discarded
lover
after
supper
don
diego
walked
a
minuet
with
madam
clement
for
whom
by
this
time
he
had
contracted
an
extraordinary
degree
of
affection
valentine
had
the
honour
to
dance
with
the
incomparable
serafina
whose
beauty
and
attractions
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
and
struck
her
bashful
partner
with
awe
and
confusion
and
melvil
presented
his
hand
to
the
agreeable
charlotte
who
performed
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
her
father
that
he
could
not
help
expressing
his
joy
and
pride
he
praised
god
for
throwing
him
in
the
way
of
our
company
and
engaged
the
clergyman
to
unite
the
young
couple
after
having
appointed
a
day
for
the
ceremony
and
invited
all
present
to
the
wedding
the
evening
having
been
insensibly
consumed
in
these
avocations
and
the
night
pretty
far
advanced
the
ladies
withdrew
without
ceremony
and
the
retreat
of
serafina
filled
renaldo
breast
with
tumult
and
emotion
his
blood
began
to
flow
in
impetuous
tides
his
heart
to
beat
with
redoubled
vigour
and
velocity
while
his
eyes
seemed
to
flash
with
more
than
human
splendour
now
his
imagination
began
to
anticipate
with
the
enthusiastic
rage
of
an
inspired
sibyl
he
was
instantaneously
transported
from
the
conversation
and
every
nerve
was
braced
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
that
human
nature
could
not
long
endure
the
tension
he
therefore
having
withstood
the
impulse
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
length
gave
way
to
his
impetuosity
and
springing
from
his
friends
found
himself
in
a
dark
passage
at
the
farther
end
of
which
he
perceived
madam
clement
coming
out
of
a
chamber
with
a
light
which
at
sight
of
him
she
set
down
and
vanished
in
a
moment
this
was
the
star
that
pointed
to
his
paradise
he
hailed
the
signal
entered
the
apartment
and
like
a
lion
rushing
on
his
prey
approached
the
nuptial
bed
where
serafina
surrounded
by
all
the
graces
of
beauty
softness
sentiment
and
truth
lay
trembling
as
a
victim
at
the
altar
and
strove
to
hide
her
blushes
from
his
view
the
door
was
shut
the
light
extinguished
he
owned
his
lot
was
more
than
mortal
man
could
claim
here
let
me
draw
the
decent
veil
that
ought
to
shade
the
secret
mysteries
of
hymen
away
unhallowed
scoffers
who
profane
with
idle
pleasantry
or
immodest
hint
these
holy
rites
and
leave
those
happy
lovers
to
enjoy
in
one
another
arms
unutterable
bliss
the
palm
of
virtue
and
of
constancy
which
had
undergone
the
most
severe
refinement
a
more
deserving
pair
night
curtain
shrouds
not
in
its
dark
extent
the
thoughts
of
renaldo
felicity
threw
a
damp
on
the
spirits
of
valentine
who
saw
the
term
of
his
probation
protracted
a
few
days
longer
and
could
not
help
wishing
in
his
heart
that
he
had
achieved
the
adventure
which
would
have
abridged
his
expectation
though
at
the
expense
of
the
old
gentleman
displeasure
he
filled
a
bumper
to
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
throwing
up
his
eyes
with
marks
of
admiration
exclaimed
how
happy
is
the
count
alas
five
days
longer
must
i
rein
my
impatience
it
is
but
reasonable
you
rogue
that
your
betters
should
have
the
start
of
you
said
the
merchant
who
did
him
justice
in
the
glass
and
counselled
him
to
drown
his
impatience
with
good
claret
the
youth
followed
his
advice
and
it
was
late
before
the
company
retired
to
rest
these
citizens
however
resolved
to
seize
an
opportunity
of
rallying
the
couple
according
to
custom
and
with
that
view
arose
early
in
the
morning
on
the
supposition
of
finding
them
still
asleep
but
they
were
not
a
little
surprised
when
they
entered
the
breakfasting
room
to
see
renaldo
and
his
amiable
already
dressed
and
awaiting
to
do
the
honours
of
the
house
the
old
gentleman
would
fain
have
cracked
a
joke
upon
their
extraordinary
despatch
but
he
was
so
much
overawed
by
the
dignity
and
tamed
by
the
sweetness
of
serafina
carriage
that
he
durst
not
give
utterance
to
his
conception
and
valentine
stood
silent
and
abashed
as
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
being
after
breakfast
these
gentlemen
and
charlotte
again
expressed
their
sense
of
the
obligations
they
owed
to
this
happy
family
repeated
their
invitation
and
taking
leave
returned
to
london
in
a
coach
that
was
provided
overnight
our
friends
being
thus
left
to
themselves
don
diego
turned
towards
melvil
now
said
he
that
i
have
yielded
to
the
impatience
of
your
love
as
well
as
to
the
eagerness
of
my
own
desire
to
make
you
happy
i
must
beg
leave
to
interrupt
for
a
little
while
the
stream
of
your
mutual
pleasure
and
propose
a
melancholy
excursion
which
however
will
not
be
wholly
void
of
enjoyment
i
have
too
long
delayed
the
performance
of
my
duty
at
antonia
grave
let
us
spend
the
forenoon
in
that
pious
pilgrimage
i
will
drop
a
few
tears
to
the
memory
of
that
excellent
woman
and
never
afterwards
shall
my
friends
be
troubled
with
my
grief
the
proposal
being
universally
approved
they
set
out
for
the
place
which
had
oft
been
visited
by
the
gentle
serafina
who
conducted
her
father
to
a
black
marble
stone
which
renaldo
had
ordered
to
be
laid
over
the
grave
and
as
he
kneeled
to
kiss
the
monument
he
perceived
this
plain
inscription
in
the
spanish
tongue
antonia
de
zelos
primera
en
todo
lo
que
es
ser
bueno
y
sin
segundo
en
todo
lo
que
fue
ser
desdichado
quedad
con
dios
that
is
antonia
de
zelos
unmatched
in
virtue
and
unequalled
in
misfortune
adieu
o
faithful
record
cried
the
castilian
smiting
his
breast
while
his
tears
distilled
upon
the
marble
thy
goodness
was
the
gift
of
heaven
but
thy
misfortunes
were
derived
from
the
guilt
of
don
diego
yet
his
sorrow
shall
expiate
his
offence
and
his
penitence
find
favour
in
the
sight
of
heaven
rest
rest
virtue
eternal
peace
shall
guard
thy
tomb
and
angels
minister
to
thy
unspotted
shade
nor
shall
thine
ashes
lie
in
dark
obscurity
here
will
i
raise
a
monument
more
suited
to
thy
excellence
and
name
serafina
melted
with
filial
tenderness
nor
were
the
rest
unmoved
at
this
affecting
scene
which
don
diego
did
not
quit
without
reluctance
chapter
the
longest
and
the
last
the
nature
of
this
visit
had
softened
every
heart
and
saddened
every
countenance
and
they
walked
in
solemn
silence
to
the
other
side
of
the
in
order
to
regain
their
carriages
when
at
the
turning
of
the
stile
they
saw
a
young
woman
in
wretched
attire
running
out
of
a
poor
habitation
wringing
her
hands
in
all
the
agony
of
despair
notwithstanding
the
distraction
in
her
countenance
and
the
meanness
of
her
apparel
she
discovered
a
regularity
of
features
and
a
delicacy
of
air
which
did
not
at
all
correspond
with
the
misery
of
her
equipage
these
exhibitions
of
extreme
distress
soon
attracted
the
notice
and
compassion
of
our
company
and
melvil
beauteous
accosting
this
forlorn
damsel
with
a
aspect
asked
the
cause
of
her
disorder
alas
dear
lady
cried
the
other
with
all
the
emphasis
of
woe
an
unhappy
gentleman
now
breathes
his
last
within
this
inhospitable
hovel
amidst
such
excess
of
misery
as
would
melt
the
most
flinty
bosom
what
then
must
i
feel
who
am
connected
with
him
by
the
strongest
ties
of
love
and
conjugal
affection
who
is
the
unfortunate
object
said
the
physician
he
was
once
well
known
in
the
gay
world
replied
the
young
woman
his
name
is
fathom
every
individual
of
the
company
started
at
mention
of
that
detested
name
serafina
began
to
tremble
with
emotion
and
renaldo
after
a
short
pause
declared
he
would
go
in
not
with
a
view
to
exult
over
his
misery
but
in
order
to
contemplate
the
catastrophe
of
such
a
wicked
life
that
the
moral
might
be
the
more
deeply
engraved
on
his
remembrance
the
young
countess
whose
tender
heart
could
not
bear
the
shock
of
such
a
spectacle
retired
to
the
coach
with
madam
clement
and
the
jew
while
renaldo
accompanied
by
the
rest
entered
a
dismal
apartment
altogether
void
of
furniture
and
convenience
where
they
beheld
the
wretched
hero
of
these
memoirs
stretched
almost
naked
upon
straw
insensible
convulsed
and
seemingly
in
the
grasp
of
death
he
was
worn
to
the
bone
either
by
famine
or
distemper
his
face
was
overshadowed
with
hair
and
filth
his
eyes
were
sunk
glazed
and
distorted
his
nostrils
dilated
his
lips
covered
with
a
black
slough
and
his
complexion
faded
into
a
pale
tending
to
a
yellow
hue
in
a
word
the
extremity
of
indigence
squalor
and
distress
could
not
be
more
feelingly
represented
while
melvil
perused
this
melancholy
lesson
and
groaning
cried
behold
the
fate
of
man
he
perceived
a
letter
in
the
right
hand
of
the
unfortunate
fathom
which
lay
fast
clenched
across
his
breast
curious
to
know
the
contents
of
this
paper
which
the
young
woman
said
he
had
kept
in
that
position
for
several
days
he
drew
nearer
the
wretched
couch
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
it
addressed
to
the
right
honourable
renaldo
count
de
melvil
to
the
care
of
joshua
manesseh
merchant
in
london
when
he
attempted
to
disengage
this
billet
from
the
author
hand
the
sorrowing
female
fell
upon
her
knees
entreating
him
to
desist
and
telling
him
she
had
promised
upon
oath
to
communicate
the
contents
to
no
person
upon
earth
but
to
carry
the
letter
upon
her
husband
decease
to
the
gentleman
to
whose
care
it
was
directed
renaldo
assured
her
upon
his
honour
that
he
was
the
very
renaldo
count
de
melvil
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
the
young
creature
was
so
much
confounded
at
this
information
that
before
she
could
recollect
herself
melvil
had
opened
the
billet
and
read
these
words
if
this
paper
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
noble
renaldo
he
will
understand
that
fathom
was
the
most
execrable
traitor
that
ever
imposed
upon
unsuspecting
benevolence
or
attempted
to
betray
a
generous
benefactor
his
whole
life
was
a
series
of
fraud
perfidy
and
the
most
abominable
ingratitude
but
of
all
the
crimes
that
lay
heavy
upon
his
soul
his
being
accessory
to
the
death
of
the
incomparable
serafina
whose
father
he
had
also
robbed
was
that
for
which
he
despaired
of
heaven
forgiveness
notwithstanding
the
dreadful
compunction
and
remorse
which
have
long
preyed
upon
his
heart
together
with
the
incredible
misery
and
deplorable
death
which
by
this
time
he
hath
undergone
though
these
sufferings
and
sorrows
can
not
atone
for
his
enormous
guilt
perhaps
they
will
excite
the
compassion
of
the
humane
count
de
melvil
at
least
this
confession
which
my
conscience
dictates
under
all
the
terrors
of
death
and
futurity
may
be
a
warning
for
him
to
avoid
henceforth
a
smiling
villain
like
the
execrable
fathom
upon
whose
miserable
soul
almighty
god
have
mercy
renaldo
was
deeply
affected
with
the
contents
of
this
scroll
which
denoted
such
horror
and
despair
he
saw
there
could
be
no
dissimulation
or
sinister
design
in
this
profession
of
penitence
he
beheld
the
condition
of
the
writer
which
put
all
his
humane
passions
in
commotion
so
that
he
remembered
nothing
of
fathom
but
his
present
distress
he
could
scarce
maintain
those
indications
which
might
have
been
justly
deemed
the
effect
of
weakness
and
infirmity
and
having
desired
the
physician
and
clergyman
to
contribute
their
assistance
for
the
benefit
of
that
wretch
soul
and
body
he
ran
to
the
coach
and
communicated
the
letter
to
the
ladies
at
the
same
time
drawing
a
picture
of
the
object
he
had
seen
which
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
serafina
who
earnestly
entreated
her
lord
to
use
his
endeavours
for
the
relief
and
recovery
of
the
unhappy
man
that
he
might
if
possible
live
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
mature
repentance
and
not
die
in
that
dreadful
despair
which
he
manifested
in
the
letter
renaldo
returning
to
the
house
found
the
pious
clergyman
reading
prayers
with
great
fervency
while
don
diego
stood
with
his
right
hand
upon
his
breast
looking
steadfastly
upon
the
agonising
fathom
and
the
young
woman
kneeled
with
her
streaming
eyes
lifted
up
to
heaven
in
an
ecstasy
of
grief
and
devotion
the
physician
had
run
to
an
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
from
whence
he
soon
returned
with
an
assistant
who
applied
a
large
blister
to
the
back
of
the
miserable
patient
while
the
female
by
the
doctor
direction
moistened
his
mouth
with
a
cordial
which
he
had
prescribed
these
charitable
steps
being
taken
count
de
melvil
entreated
the
apothecary
servant
to
procure
a
for
the
accommodation
of
the
sick
person
with
all
imaginable
despatch
and
in
less
than
an
hour
one
was
actually
pitched
and
fathom
lifted
into
it
after
he
had
been
shifted
and
in
some
measure
purified
from
the
dregs
of
his
indigence
during
this
transaction
the
ladies
were
conducted
to
a
tavern
not
far
off
where
dinner
was
bespoke
that
they
might
be
at
hand
to
see
the
effect
of
their
charity
which
was
not
confined
to
what
we
have
already
described
but
extended
so
far
that
in
a
little
time
the
apartment
was
comfortably
furnished
and
the
young
creature
provided
with
change
of
apparel
and
money
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
subsistence
notwithstanding
all
their
care
the
wretched
fathom
still
remained
insensible
and
the
doctor
pronounced
a
very
unfavourable
prognostic
while
he
ordered
a
pair
of
additional
vesicatories
to
be
laid
upon
his
arms
and
other
proper
medicines
to
be
administered
after
dinner
the
ladies
ventured
to
visit
the
place
and
when
serafina
crossed
the
threshold
the
weeping
female
fell
at
her
feet
and
kissing
her
robe
exclaimed
sure
you
are
an
angel
from
heaven
the
alteration
in
her
dress
had
made
a
very
agreeable
change
in
her
appearance
so
that
the
countess
could
now
look
upon
her
without
shuddering
at
her
distress
and
as
fathom
was
not
in
a
condition
to
be
disturbed
she
took
this
opportunity
of
inquiring
by
what
steps
that
unfortunate
wretch
was
conveyed
from
the
prison
in
which
she
knew
he
had
been
confined
to
the
place
where
he
now
lay
in
such
extremity
and
by
what
occurrence
he
had
found
a
wife
in
such
an
abyss
of
misfortune
here
the
other
tears
began
to
flow
afresh
i
am
ashamed
said
she
to
reveal
my
own
folly
yet
i
dare
not
refuse
a
satisfaction
of
this
kind
to
a
person
who
has
laid
me
under
such
signal
obligations
she
then
proceeded
to
relate
her
story
by
which
it
appeared
she
was
no
other
than
the
fair
and
unhappy
elenor
whom
the
artful
fathom
had
debauched
upon
his
first
arrival
in
town
in
the
manner
already
described
in
these
memoirs
heaven
continued
she
was
pleased
to
restore
the
use
of
my
reason
which
i
had
lost
when
i
found
myself
abandoned
by
the
count
but
all
my
connexion
with
my
own
family
being
entirely
cut
off
and
every
door
shut
against
a
poor
creature
who
could
procure
no
recommendation
except
the
certificate
signed
by
the
physician
of
bedlam
which
instead
of
introducing
me
to
service
was
an
insurmountable
objection
to
my
character
i
found
myself
destitute
of
all
means
of
subsisting
unless
i
would
condescend
to
live
the
infamous
and
wretched
life
of
a
courtezan
an
expedient
rendered
palatable
by
the
terrors
of
want
cooperating
with
the
reflection
of
the
irretrievable
loss
i
had
already
sustained
i
ask
pardon
for
offending
your
chaste
ears
with
this
impure
confession
of
my
guilt
which
heaven
knows
i
then
did
and
now
do
look
upon
with
abhorrence
and
detestation
i
had
already
forfeited
my
innocence
and
wanted
resolution
to
encounter
misery
and
death
nevertheless
before
i
could
determine
to
embrace
the
condition
of
a
prostitute
i
was
one
day
accosted
in
the
park
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
sat
down
by
me
upon
a
bench
and
taking
notice
of
the
despondence
which
was
evident
in
my
countenance
pressed
me
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
my
misfortune
so
much
sympathy
and
good
sense
appeared
in
his
deportment
and
conversation
that
i
gratified
his
request
and
he
in
return
for
my
confidence
saved
me
from
the
most
horrible
part
of
my
prospect
by
taking
me
into
his
protection
and
reserving
me
for
his
own
appetite
in
this
situation
i
lived
a
whole
year
until
i
was
deprived
of
my
keeper
by
an
apoplectic
fit
and
turned
out
of
doors
by
his
relations
who
did
not
however
strip
me
of
the
clothes
and
moveables
which
i
owed
to
his
bounty
far
from
being
as
yet
reconciled
to
a
vicious
life
i
resolved
to
renounce
the
paths
of
shame
and
converting
my
effects
into
ready
money
hired
a
small
shop
and
furnished
it
with
haberdashery
ware
intending
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
by
the
sale
of
these
commodities
together
with
the
plain
work
in
which
i
hoped
to
be
employed
so
soon
as
my
talents
should
be
known
but
this
scheme
did
not
answer
my
expectation
the
goods
spoiled
upon
my
hands
and
as
i
was
a
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
nobody
would
intrust
me
with
any
other
business
so
that
notwithstanding
the
most
parsimonious
economy
i
ran
in
debt
to
my
landlord
who
seized
my
effects
and
an
hosier
from
whom
i
had
received
some
parcels
upon
credit
took
out
a
writ
against
me
by
virtue
of
which
i
was
arrested
and
imprisoned
in
the
marshalsea
where
i
found
my
first
seducer
good
heaven
what
did
i
feel
at
this
unexpected
meeting
overwhelmed
as
i
was
before
with
my
own
distress
i
with
a
loud
scream
fainted
away
and
when
i
recovered
found
myself
in
the
arms
of
fathom
who
wept
over
me
with
great
affliction
all
his
prospects
of
gaiety
had
now
vanished
and
his
heart
was
softened
by
his
own
misfortunes
to
a
feeling
of
another
woe
as
well
as
to
a
due
sense
of
his
own
guilt
he
expressed
the
deepest
sorrow
for
having
been
the
occasion
of
my
ruin
endeavoured
to
comfort
me
with
a
promise
of
assistance
and
indeed
by
practising
medicine
among
the
prisoners
made
shift
to
keep
us
both
from
starving
but
surely
no
sinner
underwent
such
severe
remorse
as
that
which
he
suffered
during
his
imprisonment
from
the
day
of
our
meeting
i
never
once
saw
him
smile
a
melancholy
cloud
continually
overhung
his
countenance
he
numbered
the
minutes
by
his
groans
he
used
to
start
with
horror
from
his
sleep
and
striking
his
breast
would
exclaim
elenor
i
am
the
worst
of
villains
sometimes
he
seemed
disordered
in
his
brain
and
raved
about
renaldo
and
monimia
in
a
word
his
mind
was
in
a
dreadful
situation
and
all
his
agonies
were
communicated
to
me
whom
by
this
time
he
had
married
in
order
to
make
some
atonement
for
my
wrongs
wretched
as
he
then
was
i
remembered
the
accomplished
youth
who
had
captivated
my
virgin
heart
the
old
impressions
still
remained
i
saw
his
penitence
pitied
his
misfortune
and
his
wife
being
dead
consented
to
join
his
fate
the
ceremony
having
been
performed
by
a
who
was
in
orders
though
his
creditor
had
no
other
chance
of
being
paid
than
that
of
setting
him
at
liberty
he
lent
a
deaf
ear
to
all
our
supplications
and
this
cruelty
conspiring
with
the
anguish
of
my
husband
own
reflection
affected
his
health
and
spirits
to
such
a
degree
that
he
could
no
longer
earn
the
miserable
pittance
which
had
hitherto
supported
our
lives
then
our
calamities
began
to
multiply
indigence
and
famine
stared
us
in
the
face
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
we
resisted
their
attacks
by
selling
or
pledging
our
wearing
apparel
until
we
were
left
almost
quite
naked
when
we
found
ourselves
discharged
by
an
act
passed
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtors
this
charitable
law
which
was
intended
for
a
consolation
to
the
wretched
proved
to
us
the
most
severe
disaster
for
we
were
turned
out
into
the
streets
utterly
destitute
of
food
raiment
and
lodging
at
a
time
when
fathom
was
so
weakened
by
his
distemper
that
he
could
not
stand
alone
i
supported
him
from
door
to
door
imploring
the
compassion
of
charitable
christians
and
was
at
length
permitted
to
shelter
him
in
this
miserable
place
where
his
disease
gaining
ground
he
lay
three
days
in
that
deplorable
condition
from
which
he
hath
now
been
rescued
though
i
fear
too
late
by
your
humanity
and
benevolence
she
shed
a
flood
of
tears
at
the
conclusion
of
this
mournful
tale
which
did
not
fail
to
affect
the
whole
audience
especially
serafina
who
assured
her
that
whatever
should
happen
to
her
husband
she
might
depend
upon
finding
favour
and
protection
provided
her
conduct
should
correspond
with
her
professions
while
this
grateful
creature
kissed
the
hand
of
her
kind
benefactress
fathom
uttered
a
groan
began
to
stir
in
the
bed
and
with
a
languid
voice
called
upon
elenor
who
instantly
withdrawing
the
curtain
presented
the
whole
company
to
his
view
he
had
now
retrieved
the
use
of
his
perception
by
the
operation
of
the
blisters
which
began
to
torture
him
severely
he
looked
around
him
with
amazement
and
affright
and
distinguishing
the
three
persons
against
whom
the
chief
arrows
of
his
fraud
and
treachery
had
been
levelled
he
concluded
that
he
was
now
arrived
at
the
land
of
departed
souls
and
that
the
shades
of
those
whom
he
had
so
grievously
injured
were
come
to
see
him
tormented
according
to
his
demerits
fraught
with
this
notion
which
was
confirmed
by
the
bodily
pain
which
he
felt
and
the
appearance
of
the
clergyman
and
joshua
whom
he
mistook
for
the
ministers
of
vengeance
he
cried
in
a
tone
replete
with
horror
is
there
no
mercy
then
for
penitence
is
there
no
pity
due
to
the
miseries
i
suffered
upon
earth
save
me
o
bountiful
heaven
from
the
terrors
of
everlasting
woe
hide
me
from
these
dreadful
executioners
whose
looks
are
torture
forgive
me
generous
castilian
o
renaldo
thou
hadst
once
a
tender
heart
i
dare
not
lift
my
eyes
to
serafina
that
pattern
of
human
excellence
who
fell
a
victim
to
my
atrocious
guilt
yet
her
aspect
is
all
mildness
and
compassion
hah
are
not
these
the
drops
of
pity
yes
they
are
the
tears
of
mercy
they
fall
like
refreshing
showers
upon
my
drooping
soul
ah
murdered
innocence
wilt
thou
not
intercede
for
thy
betrayer
at
the
throne
of
grace
here
he
was
interrupted
by
melvil
who
with
a
grave
and
solemn
air
pronounced
great
hath
been
thy
guilt
unhappy
ferdinand
and
great
have
been
thy
sufferings
yet
we
come
not
to
insult
but
to
alleviate
thy
distress
providence
hath
kindly
defeated
thy
dire
intentions
which
we
therefore
now
forgive
and
transmit
to
oblivion
whether
it
be
thy
lot
to
yield
up
thy
spirit
immediately
or
to
survive
the
dangerous
malady
with
which
thou
art
at
present
overwhelmed
suffer
not
thyself
to
despair
for
the
mercy
of
heaven
is
infinite
and
submit
to
the
directions
of
this
worthy
gentleman
who
will
employ
his
skill
for
thy
recovery
while
we
shall
take
care
to
furnish
thee
with
necessary
attendance
as
too
much
speaking
may
be
prejudicial
to
thy
health
i
dispense
with
thy
reply
and
exhort
thee
to
compose
thyself
to
rest
so
saying
he
drew
the
curtain
and
the
company
retired
leaving
fathom
entranced
with
wonder
the
next
step
which
renaldo
took
for
the
benefit
of
this
wretched
penitent
was
to
send
for
the
apothecary
with
whom
he
left
a
sum
of
money
to
be
expended
for
the
convenience
of
fathom
and
his
wife
then
he
laid
injunctions
upon
the
physician
to
repeat
his
visits
and
that
gentleman
together
with
the
clergyman
and
joshua
taking
leave
of
the
others
till
next
day
the
count
set
out
with
the
ladies
and
his
to
the
house
where
they
had
lodged
the
preceding
night
the
reader
may
well
imagine
the
conversation
of
the
evening
turned
wholly
upon
the
strange
occurrence
of
the
day
which
seemed
to
have
been
concerted
by
supernatural
prescience
in
order
to
satisfy
the
vengeance
and
afford
matter
of
triumph
to
the
generosity
of
those
who
had
been
so
grievously
injured
by
the
guilty
fathom
though
not
one
of
them
would
say
that
such
a
miscreant
ought
to
live
yet
all
concurred
in
approving
the
offices
of
humanity
which
had
been
performed
and
even
endeavoured
to
find
specious
pretext
for
vindicating
their
compassion
don
diego
said
it
would
ill
become
a
transgressor
like
him
to
withhold
his
forgiveness
from
a
sinner
who
had
wronged
him
madam
clement
appealed
to
the
approbation
of
heaven
which
had
undoubtedly
directed
them
that
way
for
the
purpose
they
had
fulfilled
serafina
observed
that
the
crimes
of
the
delinquent
were
obliterated
by
his
sorrow
misery
and
repentance
renaldo
honestly
owned
that
exclusive
of
other
reasons
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
luxurious
enjoyment
of
communicating
happiness
to
his
in
distress
and
each
fervently
prayed
that
their
charity
might
not
be
disappointed
by
the
death
of
the
object
while
they
amused
themselves
in
these
discussions
fathom
after
having
lain
some
hours
silent
in
consequence
of
renaldo
advice
could
no
longer
suppress
the
astonishment
of
his
mind
but
addressing
himself
to
his
wife
o
elenor
said
he
my
delirium
is
now
past
though
i
still
remember
the
phantasies
of
my
distempered
brain
among
other
reveries
my
imagination
was
regaled
with
a
vision
so
perfect
and
distinct
as
to
emulate
truth
and
reality
methought
count
de
melvil
don
diego
de
zelos
and
the
divine
serafina
the
very
persons
who
are
now
crying
before
the
throne
of
heaven
for
vengeance
against
the
guilty
fathom
stood
by
my
bedside
with
looks
of
pity
and
forgiveness
and
that
renaldo
spoke
peace
to
my
despairing
soul
i
heard
the
words
distinctly
i
retain
them
in
my
memory
i
saw
the
tears
trickle
from
serafina
eyes
i
heard
her
father
utter
a
compassionate
sigh
and
should
actually
believe
that
they
were
personally
present
had
not
i
long
ago
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
funeral
procession
of
that
young
lady
whose
wrongs
god
pardon
and
were
i
not
convinced
that
such
a
meeting
could
not
be
effected
without
the
immediate
and
miraculous
interposition
of
heaven
yet
everything
i
now
see
corresponds
with
the
words
of
renaldo
which
still
sound
in
my
ears
when
my
perception
forsook
me
i
lay
in
the
most
abject
misery
among
straw
and
thou
poor
injured
innocence
wast
naked
and
forlorn
now
i
find
myself
reposed
in
a
warm
easy
comfortable
bed
i
see
around
me
the
marks
of
human
charity
and
care
and
the
favourable
change
in
thy
appearance
glads
my
poor
dejected
heart
say
whence
this
happy
alteration
do
i
really
awake
from
that
dream
of
misery
in
which
we
have
continued
so
long
or
do
i
still
utter
the
extravagant
ravings
of
a
distempered
brain
elenor
was
afraid
of
imparting
at
once
all
the
particulars
of
the
happy
change
he
had
undergone
lest
they
might
leave
a
dangerous
impression
upon
his
fancy
which
was
not
yet
duly
composed
she
contented
herself
therefore
with
telling
him
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
the
humanity
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
who
chanced
to
pass
that
way
by
accident
and
who
understanding
his
deplorable
case
had
furnished
him
with
the
conveniences
which
he
now
enjoyed
she
then
presented
to
him
what
the
doctor
had
directed
her
to
administer
and
admonishing
him
to
commit
his
head
to
the
pillow
he
was
favoured
with
a
breathing
sweat
fell
fast
asleep
and
in
a
few
hours
waked
again
altogether
cool
and
undisturbed
it
was
upon
this
occasion
that
his
wife
explained
the
circumstances
of
that
visit
which
had
redeemed
him
from
extremity
of
wretchedness
and
the
jaws
of
death
upon
which
he
started
up
and
throwing
himself
upon
his
knees
exclaimed
power
this
was
the
work
of
thy
own
bounteous
hand
the
voice
of
my
sorrow
and
repentance
hath
been
heard
thou
hast
inspired
my
benefactors
with
more
than
mortal
goodness
in
my
behalf
how
shall
i
praise
thy
name
how
shall
i
requite
their
generosity
oh
i
am
bankrupt
to
both
yet
let
me
not
perish
until
i
shall
have
convinced
them
of
my
reformation
and
seen
them
enjoying
that
felicity
which
ought
to
be
reserved
for
such
consummate
virtue
next
day
in
the
forenoon
he
was
visited
by
the
physician
whom
he
now
recollected
to
have
seen
at
the
house
of
madam
clement
and
after
having
thanked
that
gentleman
for
his
humanity
and
care
he
earnestly
begged
to
know
by
what
means
serafina
had
been
preserved
when
he
was
satisfied
in
this
particular
and
given
to
understand
that
she
was
now
happy
in
the
arms
of
renaldo
blessed
be
god
he
cried
for
having
defeated
the
villany
of
him
who
sought
to
part
such
lovers
dear
sir
will
you
add
one
circumstance
to
your
charity
and
bear
to
that
happy
couple
and
the
noble
don
diego
the
respects
and
the
remorse
of
a
sincere
penitent
whom
their
compassion
hath
raised
to
life
i
have
been
such
a
traitor
to
them
that
my
words
deserve
no
regard
i
will
not
therefore
use
professions
i
dare
not
hope
to
be
admitted
into
their
presence
i
am
indeed
ashamed
to
see
the
light
of
the
sun
how
then
could
i
bear
the
looks
of
that
injured
family
ah
no
let
me
hide
myself
in
some
obscure
retreat
where
i
may
work
out
my
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
and
pray
incessantly
to
heaven
for
their
prosperity
the
physician
promised
to
represent
his
contrition
to
the
count
and
his
lady
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
their
habitation
where
he
repeated
these
expressions
and
pronounced
his
patient
out
of
danger
so
that
their
thoughts
were
now
employed
in
concerting
a
scheme
for
his
future
subsistence
that
he
might
not
be
exposed
by
indigence
to
a
relapse
in
point
of
morals
renaldo
being
still
averse
to
any
personal
intercourse
with
such
a
wretch
until
he
should
give
some
undoubted
proofs
of
amendment
and
as
yet
afraid
of
intrusting
him
with
any
office
that
required
integrity
resolved
with
the
approbation
of
all
present
to
settle
him
in
a
cheap
county
in
the
north
of
england
where
he
and
his
wife
could
live
comfortably
on
an
annuity
of
sixty
pounds
until
his
behaviour
should
entitle
him
to
a
better
provision
this
resolution
was
just
taken
when
joshua
arrived
with
a
gentleman
whom
he
introduced
to
don
diego
as
the
secretary
of
the
spanish
ambassador
after
the
first
compliments
the
stranger
told
the
castilian
that
he
waited
upon
him
at
the
desire
of
his
excellency
who
would
have
come
in
person
had
he
not
been
confined
by
the
gout
then
he
put
into
his
hand
a
letter
from
the
court
of
madrid
written
by
a
nobleman
of
acquaintance
who
informed
him
that
don
manuel
de
mendoza
having
made
away
with
himself
by
poison
in
order
to
avoid
the
disgrace
of
a
legal
conviction
his
catholic
majesty
was
now
convinced
of
don
innocence
and
granted
him
leave
to
return
and
take
possession
of
his
honours
and
estate
this
information
was
confirmed
by
the
secretary
who
assured
him
that
the
ambassador
had
orders
to
make
him
acquainted
with
this
favourable
decision
of
the
king
the
castilian
having
first
acquitted
himself
in
the
most
polite
terms
to
the
secretary
and
the
jew
who
he
said
had
always
been
a
messenger
of
glad
tidings
communicated
his
happiness
to
the
company
and
this
evening
concluded
the
third
day
of
their
rejoicing
next
morning
don
diego
went
to
visit
the
ambassador
accompanied
by
joshua
and
the
secretary
while
the
physician
repairing
to
the
habitation
of
fathom
signified
by
renaldo
direction
the
resolution
which
had
been
taken
in
his
behalf
and
the
patient
no
sooner
heard
his
doom
than
lifting
up
his
hands
he
cried
i
am
unworthy
of
such
tenderness
and
benevolence
while
elenor
shed
a
flood
of
tears
in
silence
unable
to
give
utterance
to
her
grateful
thought
bounty
having
so
far
transcended
her
most
sanguine
hope
the
spaniard
having
paid
his
devoirs
to
his
excellency
returned
before
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
desiring
a
private
conference
with
serafina
they
retired
into
another
apartment
and
he
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
you
have
contracted
my
dear
child
an
habit
of
calling
madam
clement
your
mother
and
doubtless
by
her
maternal
tenderness
and
regard
she
hath
acquired
a
just
title
to
the
appellation
yet
i
own
i
would
fain
strengthen
it
by
a
legal
claim
i
no
sooner
retrieved
my
daughter
than
i
gave
her
away
to
the
most
deserving
youth
that
ever
sighed
with
i
rejoice
in
the
gift
which
secured
your
happiness
but
i
left
myself
in
a
solitary
situation
which
even
the
return
of
my
good
fortune
can
not
render
easy
and
supportable
when
i
revisit
the
castle
of
zelos
every
object
will
recall
the
memory
of
my
antonia
and
i
shall
want
a
companion
to
fill
her
place
and
to
sympathise
with
me
in
that
sorrow
which
will
be
derived
from
my
remembrance
who
is
there
so
worthy
to
succeed
your
mother
in
the
affection
of
don
diego
as
she
who
interests
her
love
for
serafina
and
resembles
her
so
strongly
in
every
virtue
of
the
sex
similar
attractions
will
produce
similar
effects
my
heart
is
already
attached
to
that
good
lady
and
provided
serafina
shall
approve
of
my
choice
i
will
lay
myself
and
fortune
at
her
feet
the
fair
countess
replied
with
an
enchanting
smile
that
before
this
declaration
she
had
with
pleasure
perceived
the
progress
which
madam
clement
had
made
in
his
heart
and
that
she
did
not
believe
there
was
a
person
upon
earth
better
qualified
to
repair
the
loss
he
had
sustained
though
she
foresaw
one
obstacle
to
his
happiness
which
she
was
afraid
would
not
be
easily
surmounted
you
mean
answered
the
castilian
the
difference
of
religion
which
i
am
resolved
to
remove
by
adopting
the
protestant
faith
though
i
am
fully
satisfied
that
real
goodness
is
of
no
particular
persuasion
and
that
salvation
can
not
depend
upon
belief
over
which
the
will
has
no
influence
i
invest
you
therefore
with
the
charge
of
declaring
my
passion
and
proposal
and
empower
you
to
satisfy
her
scruples
with
regard
to
the
religion
which
i
now
profess
and
which
i
shall
not
openly
relinquish
until
i
shall
have
secured
in
this
country
effects
sufficient
to
screen
me
from
the
ill
consequences
of
my
displeasure
serafina
undertook
this
office
with
pleasure
because
she
had
reason
to
think
his
addresses
would
not
be
disagreeable
to
madam
clement
and
that
same
night
made
the
count
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
her
commission
nor
was
her
expectation
disappointed
the
french
lady
with
that
frankness
which
is
peculiar
to
virtue
and
good
breeding
confessed
that
don
diego
was
not
indifferent
to
her
choice
and
did
not
hesitate
in
receiving
him
upon
the
footing
of
a
as
we
have
already
dwelt
circumstantially
on
the
passion
of
love
so
as
perhaps
even
to
have
tired
our
readers
we
shall
not
repeat
the
dialogue
that
passed
when
the
spaniard
was
indulged
with
an
opportunity
to
explain
his
sentiments
suffice
it
to
observe
that
the
lady
days
of
coquetry
were
now
over
and
that
she
was
too
wise
to
trifle
with
the
time
which
every
moment
became
more
and
more
precious
it
was
agreed
then
that
don
diego
should
settle
his
affairs
in
spain
and
return
to
england
in
order
to
espouse
madam
clement
with
a
view
to
fix
his
residence
in
this
island
where
renaldo
likewise
proposed
to
enjoy
the
sweets
of
his
fortune
provided
he
could
draw
hither
his
interests
and
connexions
meanwhile
having
for
some
days
enjoyed
his
bliss
with
all
the
fulness
of
rapture
amidst
this
small
but
agreeable
society
he
shifted
the
scene
and
conducted
his
dear
partner
to
a
house
in
town
which
together
with
an
occasional
equipage
his
friend
joshua
had
hired
for
the
accommodation
of
him
and
his
who
during
his
stay
in
england
failed
not
to
cultivate
the
mistress
of
his
heart
with
the
most
punctual
assiduity
hitherto
serafina
had
been
as
a
precious
jewel
locked
up
in
a
casket
which
the
owner
alone
had
an
opportunity
to
contemplate
but
now
the
count
who
was
proud
of
such
a
prize
resolved
to
let
her
shine
forth
to
the
admiration
of
the
whole
world
with
this
view
he
bespoke
such
ornaments
as
befitted
her
quality
and
while
the
were
employed
in
her
service
made
a
tour
among
his
former
acquaintance
and
discharged
the
obligations
under
which
he
lay
to
some
who
had
assisted
him
in
his
distress
he
did
not
however
introduce
them
to
his
charming
serafina
because
not
one
of
them
had
formerly
treated
her
with
that
delicacy
of
regard
which
he
thought
her
due
and
some
of
them
were
much
mortified
at
their
neglect
when
they
saw
what
a
dazzling
figure
she
made
in
the
beau
monde
she
was
visited
by
the
spanish
and
imperial
ambassadors
and
divers
other
foreigners
of
distinction
to
whom
melvil
had
letters
of
recommendation
but
her
first
public
appearance
was
in
a
box
at
the
opera
accompanied
by
madam
clement
the
count
and
don
diego
the
entertainment
was
already
begun
so
that
her
entrance
had
the
greater
effect
upon
the
audience
whose
attention
was
soon
detached
from
the
performance
and
riveted
upon
this
amiable
apparition
which
seemed
to
be
some
bright
being
of
another
world
dropped
from
the
clouds
among
them
then
did
the
spirit
of
curiosity
play
its
part
a
thousand
whispers
circulated
as
many
glasses
were
exalted
to
reconnoitre
this
box
of
foreigners
for
such
they
concluded
them
to
be
from
their
appearance
every
male
spectator
acknowledged
serafina
to
be
the
paragon
of
beauty
and
every
female
confessed
that
melvil
was
the
model
of
a
fine
gentleman
the
charms
of
the
young
countess
did
not
escape
the
eye
and
approbation
of
royalty
itself
and
when
her
rank
was
known
from
the
information
of
the
ambassadors
and
other
people
of
condition
who
were
seen
saluting
her
at
a
distance
that
same
evening
a
thousand
bumpers
were
swallowed
in
honour
of
the
countess
de
melvil
the
fame
of
her
beauty
was
immediately
extended
over
this
immense
metropolis
and
different
schemes
were
concerted
for
bringing
her
into
life
these
however
she
resisted
with
unwearied
obstinacy
her
happiness
centred
in
renaldo
and
the
cultivation
of
a
few
friends
within
the
shade
of
domestic
quiet
she
did
not
even
forget
the
concerns
of
the
wretched
fathom
and
his
faithful
elenor
who
daily
enjoyed
fresh
instances
of
her
humanity
and
care
when
his
fever
forsook
him
he
was
supplied
with
nourishing
food
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
and
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
travel
he
gave
notice
to
his
benefactor
who
desired
joshua
to
settle
with
him
the
manner
in
which
he
was
to
receive
his
allowance
and
to
pay
the
first
salary
per
advance
this
affair
being
adjusted
and
the
place
of
his
retreat
signified
the
jew
told
elenor
that
she
might
wait
upon
the
countess
before
their
departure
and
she
did
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
after
they
had
made
the
necessary
preparations
for
their
journey
and
taken
places
in
the
york
fathom
clothing
herself
in
decent
apparel
went
to
the
house
of
count
melvil
and
was
immediately
admitted
to
the
presence
of
serafina
who
received
her
with
her
usual
complacency
enriched
her
with
salutary
advice
comforted
her
with
the
hope
of
better
things
provided
her
conduct
and
that
of
her
husband
should
henceforth
be
found
irreproachable
and
wishing
her
peace
and
happiness
presented
her
with
a
box
of
linen
and
twenty
guineas
in
a
purse
such
excessive
goodness
overpowered
this
sensible
young
woman
to
such
a
degree
that
she
stood
before
her
in
speechless
awe
and
veneration
and
the
countess
in
order
to
relieve
her
from
the
confusion
under
which
she
suffered
quitted
the
room
leaving
her
to
the
care
of
her
woman
it
was
not
long
however
before
her
gratitude
broke
out
in
loud
exclamations
and
a
violent
passion
of
tears
which
all
her
efforts
could
not
for
a
while
overcome
by
this
time
the
coach
was
brought
up
to
the
gate
for
the
reception
of
serafina
who
took
an
airing
every
day
at
the
same
hour
when
renaldo
leading
her
to
the
vehicle
beheld
a
man
plainly
dressed
standing
within
the
court
with
his
head
and
body
bent
towards
the
earth
so
that
his
countenance
could
not
be
perceived
melvil
who
supposed
him
to
be
some
unfortunate
man
come
to
implore
his
charity
turned
towards
him
and
asked
with
a
humane
accent
if
he
wanted
to
speak
with
any
person
in
the
house
to
this
interrogation
the
stranger
replied
without
lifting
up
his
head
overwhelmed
as
i
am
with
count
melvil
generosity
together
with
a
consciousness
of
my
own
unworthiness
it
ill
becomes
a
wretch
like
me
to
importune
him
for
further
favour
yet
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
withdrawing
perhaps
for
ever
from
the
presence
of
my
benefactor
without
soliciting
his
permission
to
see
his
face
in
mercy
to
acknowledge
my
atrocious
crimes
to
hear
my
pardon
confirmed
by
his
voice
and
that
of
his
accomplished
countess
whom
i
dare
not
even
at
a
distance
behold
and
to
express
my
fervent
wish
for
their
prosperity
melvil
whose
heart
was
but
too
tender
could
not
hear
this
address
without
emotion
he
recognised
the
companion
of
his
infancy
and
youth
he
remembered
the
happy
scenes
he
had
enjoyed
with
fathom
whose
voice
had
always
such
an
effect
upon
his
ear
as
to
excite
the
ideas
of
friendship
and
esteem
and
he
was
disturbed
by
this
unexpected
meeting
which
also
discomposed
the
beauteous
serafina
renaldo
having
paused
a
little
it
is
with
pain
said
he
i
recollect
anything
to
the
prejudice
of
fathom
whose
future
behaviour
will
i
hope
erase
the
memory
of
his
offences
and
justify
what
other
steps
i
may
take
in
his
favour
meanwhile
i
heartily
forgive
what
is
past
and
in
token
of
my
sincerity
present
my
hand
which
our
adventurer
