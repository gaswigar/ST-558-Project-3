man

oldham
in
the
christian
gospel
tract
of
the
and
the
soul
of
a
bishop
chapter
the
first
the
dream
it
was
a
scene
of
bitter
disputation
a
young
man
with
a
pointing
finger
was
prominent
his
face
worked
violently
his
lips
moved
very
rapidly
but
what
he
said
was
inaudible
behind
him
the
little
rufous
man
with
the
big
eyes
twitched
at
his
robe
and
offered
suggestions
and
behind
these
two
clustered
a
great
multitude
of
heated
excited
swarthy
faces
the
emperor
sat
on
his
golden
throne
in
the
midst
of
the
gathering
commanding
silence
by
gestures
speaking
inaudibly
to
them
in
a
tongue
the
majority
did
not
use
and
then
prevailing
they
ceased
their
interruptions
and
the
old
man
arius
took
up
the
debate
for
a
time
all
those
impassioned
faces
were
intent
upon
him
they
listened
as
though
they
sought
occasion
and
suddenly
as
if
by
a
preconcerted
arrangement
they
were
all
thrusting
their
fingers
into
their
ears
and
knitting
their
brows
in
assumed
horror
some
were
crying
aloud
and
making
as
if
to
fly
some
indeed
tucked
up
their
garments
and
fled
they
spread
out
into
a
pattern
they
were
like
the
little
monks
who
run
from
jerome
lion
in
the
picture
by
carpaccio
then
one
zealot
rushed
forward
and
smote
the
old
man
heavily
upon
the
mouth
the
hall
seemed
to
grow
vaster
and
vaster
the
disputing
infuriated
figures
multiplied
to
an
innumerable
assembly
they
drove
about
like
snowflakes
in
a
gale
they
whirled
in
argumentative
couples
they
spun
in
eddies
of
contradiction
they
made
extraordinary
patterns
and
then
amidst
the
cloudy
darkness
of
the
unfathomable
dome
above
them
there
appeared
and
increased
a
radiant
triangle
in
which
shone
an
eye
the
eye
and
the
triangle
filled
the
heavens
sent
out
flickering
rays
glowed
to
a
blinding
incandescence
seemed
to
be
speaking
words
of
thunder
that
were
nevertheless
inaudible
it
was
as
if
that
thunder
filled
the
heavens
it
was
as
if
it
were
nothing
but
the
beating
artery
in
the
sleeper
ear
the
attention
strained
to
hear
and
comprehend
and
on
the
very
verge
of
comprehension
snapped
like
a
nicoea
the
word
remained
like
a
little
ash
after
a
flare
the
sleeper
had
awakened
and
lay
very
still
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
intellectual
effort
that
had
survived
the
dream
in
which
it
had
arisen
was
it
so
that
things
had
happened
the
mind
moving
obscurely
could
not
determine
whether
it
was
so
or
not
had
they
indeed
behaved
in
this
manner
when
the
great
mystery
was
established
who
said
they
stopped
their
ears
with
their
fingers
and
fled
shouting
with
horror
shouting
was
it
eusebius
or
athanasius
or
sozomen
some
letter
or
apology
by
athanasius
and
surely
it
was
impossible
that
the
trinity
could
have
appeared
visibly
as
a
triangle
and
an
eye
above
such
an
assembly
that
was
mere
dreaming
of
course
was
it
dreaming
after
raphael
after
raphael
the
drowsy
mind
wandered
into
a
side
issue
was
the
picture
that
had
suggested
this
dream
the
one
in
the
vatican
where
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
are
shown
disputing
together
but
there
surely
god
and
the
son
themselves
were
painted
with
a
symbol
some
symbol
also
but
was
that
disputation
about
the
trinity
at
all
was
it
rather
about
a
chalice
and
a
dove
of
course
it
was
a
chalice
and
a
dove
then
where
did
one
see
the
triangle
and
the
eye
and
men
disputing
some
such
picture
there
was
what
a
lot
of
disputing
there
had
been
what
endless
disputing
which
had
gone
on
until
last
night
when
this
very
disagreeable
young
man
with
the
hawk
nose
and
the
pointing
finger
had
tackled
one
when
one
was
sorely
fagged
and
disputed
disputed
rebuked
and
disputed
answer
me
this
he
had
said
and
still
one
poor
brains
disputed
and
would
not
rest
about
the
trinity
the
brain
upon
the
pillow
was
now
wearily
awake
it
was
at
once
hopelessly
awake
and
active
and
hopelessly
unprogressive
it
was
like
some
floating
stick
that
had
got
caught
in
an
eddy
in
a
river
going
round
and
round
and
round
and
round
eternally
eternally
eternally
begotten
but
what
possible
meaning
do
you
attach
then
to
such
a
phrase
as
eternally
begotten
the
brain
upon
the
pillow
stared
hopelessly
at
this
question
without
an
answer
without
an
escape
the
three
repetitions
spun
round
and
round
became
a
swiftly
revolving
triangle
like
some
electric
sign
that
had
got
beyond
control
in
the
midst
of
which
stared
an
unwinking
and
resentful
eye
every
one
knows
that
expedient
of
the
sleepless
the
counting
of
sheep
you
lie
quite
still
you
breathe
regularly
you
imagine
sheep
jumping
over
a
gate
one
after
another
you
count
them
quietly
and
slowly
until
you
count
yourself
off
through
a
fading
string
of
phantom
numbers
to
number
nod
but
sheep
alas
suggest
an
episcopal
crook
and
presently
a
black
sheep
had
got
into
the
succession
and
was
struggling
violently
with
the
crook
about
its
leg
a
black
sheep
full
of
reproof
with
disordered
hair
and
a
pointing
finger
a
young
man
with
a
most
disagreeable
voice
at
which
the
other
sheep
took
heart
and
deserting
the
numbered
succession
came
and
sat
about
the
fire
in
a
big
and
argued
also
in
particular
there
was
lady
sunderbund
a
pretty
fragile
tall
woman
in
the
corner
richly
jewelled
who
sat
with
her
pretty
eyes
watching
and
her
lips
compressed
what
had
she
thought
of
it
she
had
said
very
little
it
is
an
unusual
thing
for
a
mixed
gathering
of
this
sort
to
argue
about
the
trinity
simply
because
a
tired
bishop
had
fallen
into
their
party
it
was
not
fair
to
him
to
pretend
that
the
atmosphere
was
a
liberal
and
inquiring
one
when
the
young
man
who
had
sat
still
and
dormant
by
the
table
was
in
reality
a
keen
and
bitter
irish
roman
catholic
then
the
question
a
question
was
put
quite
suddenly
without
preparation
or
prelude
by
surprise
why
bishop
was
the
spermaticos
logos
identified
with
the
second
and
not
the
third
person
of
the
trinity
it
was
indiscreet
it
was
silly
to
turn
upon
the
speaker
and
affect
an
air
of
disengagement
and
modernity
and
to
say
ah
that
indeed
is
the
unfortunate
aspect
of
the
whole
whereupon
the
fierce
young
man
had
exploded
with
to
that
is
it
that
you
anglicans
have
come
the
whole
gathering
had
given
itself
up
to
the
disputation
lady
sunderbund
an
actress
a
dancer
though
she
it
is
true
did
not
say
very
much
a
novelist
a
mechanical
expert
of
some
sort
a
railway
peer
geniuses
hairy
and
celtic
people
of
no
clearly
definable
position
but
all
quite
unequal
to
the
task
of
maintaining
that
air
of
reverent
vagueness
that
tenderness
of
touch
which
is
by
all
anglican
standards
imperative
in
so
deep
so
mysterious
and
nowadays
in
mixed
society
at
least
so
infrequent
a
discussion
it
was
like
animals
breaking
down
a
fence
about
some
sacred
spot
within
a
couple
of
minutes
the
affair
had
become
highly
improper
they
had
raised
their
voices
they
had
spoken
with
the
utmost
familiarity
of
almost
unspeakable
things
there
had
been
even
attempts
at
epigram
athanasian
epigrams
bent
the
novelist
had
doubted
if
originally
there
had
been
a
third
person
in
the
trinity
at
all
he
suggested
a
reaction
from
a
dualism
at
some
date
after
the
time
of
gospel
he
maintained
obstinately
that
that
gospel
was
dualistic
the
unpleasant
quality
of
the
talk
was
far
more
manifest
in
the
retrospect
than
it
had
been
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
then
bold
and
strange
but
not
impossible
now
in
the
cold
darkness
it
seemed
sacrilegious
and
the
bishop
share
which
was
indeed
only
the
weak
yielding
of
a
tired
man
to
an
atmosphere
he
had
misjudged
became
a
disgraceful
display
of
levity
and
bad
faith
they
had
baited
him
some
one
had
said
that
nowadays
every
one
was
an
arian
knowingly
or
unknowingly
they
had
not
concealed
their
conviction
that
the
bishop
did
not
really
believe
in
the
creeds
he
uttered
and
that
unfortunate
first
admission
stuck
terribly
in
his
throat
oh
why
had
he
made
it
sleep
had
gone
the
awakened
sleeper
groaned
sat
up
in
the
darkness
and
felt
gropingly
in
this
unaccustomed
bed
and
bedroom
first
for
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
then
for
the
electric
light
that
was
possibly
on
the
little
bedside
table
the
searching
hand
touched
something
a
the
hand
resumed
its
exploration
here
was
something
metallic
and
smooth
a
stem
either
above
or
below
there
must
be
a
switch
the
switch
was
found
grasped
and
turned
the
darkness
fled
in
a
mirror
the
sleeper
saw
the
reflection
of
his
face
and
a
corner
of
the
bed
in
which
he
lay
the
lamp
had
a
tilted
shade
that
threw
a
slanting
bar
of
shadow
across
the
field
of
reflection
lighting
a
triangle
very
brightly
and
leaving
the
rest
obscure
the
bed
was
a
very
great
one
a
bed
for
the
anakim
it
had
a
canopy
with
yellow
silk
curtains
surmounted
by
a
gilded
crown
of
carved
wood
between
the
curtains
was
a
man
face
pale
with
disordered
brown
hair
and
weary
eyes
he
was
clad
in
purple
pyjamas
and
the
hand
that
now
ran
its
fingers
through
the
brown
hair
was
long
and
lean
and
shapely
beside
the
bed
was
a
convenient
little
table
bearing
the
light
a
and
glass
a
bunch
of
keys
a
congested
a
fountain
pen
and
a
gold
watch
that
indicated
a
quarter
past
three
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
picture
in
the
mirror
appeared
the
back
of
a
gilt
chair
over
which
a
garment
of
peculiar
construction
had
been
carelessly
thrown
it
was
in
the
form
of
that
sleeveless
cassock
of
purple
opening
at
the
side
whose
lower
flap
is
called
a
apron
the
corner
of
the
frogged
coat
showed
behind
the
and
the
sash
lay
crumpled
on
the
floor
black
doeskin
breeches
still
warmly
lined
with
their
pants
lay
where
they
had
been
thrust
off
at
the
corner
of
the
bed
partly
covering
black
hose
and
shoes
for
a
moment
the
tired
gaze
of
the
man
in
the
bed
rested
upon
these
evidences
of
his
episcopal
dignity
then
he
turned
from
them
to
the
watch
at
the
bedside
he
groaned
helplessly
these
country
doctors
were
no
good
there
was
a
physician
in
the
diocese
he
must
go
to
london
he
looked
into
the
weary
eyes
of
his
reflection
and
said
as
one
makes
a
reassuring
promise
he
was
being
worried
he
was
being
intolerably
worried
and
he
was
ill
and
unable
to
sustain
his
positions
this
doubt
this
sudden
discovery
of
controversial
unsoundness
was
only
one
aspect
of
his
general
neurasthenia
it
had
been
creeping
into
his
mind
since
the
light
unden
the
altar
controversy
now
suddenly
it
had
leapt
upon
him
from
his
own
unwary
lips
the
immediate
trouble
arose
from
his
loyalty
he
had
followed
the
example
he
had
become
a
total
abstainer
and
in
addition
on
his
own
account
he
had
ceased
to
smoke
and
his
digestion
which
princhester
had
first
made
sensitive
was
deranged
he
was
suffering
chemically
suffering
one
of
those
nameless
sequences
of
maladjustments
that
still
defy
our
ordinary
medical
science
it
was
afflicting
him
with
a
general
malaise
it
was
affecting
his
energy
his
temper
all
the
balance
and
comfort
of
his
nerves
all
day
he
was
weary
all
night
he
was
wakeful
he
was
estranged
from
his
body
he
was
distressed
by
a
sense
of
detachment
from
the
things
about
him
by
a
curious
intimation
of
unreality
in
everything
he
experienced
and
with
that
went
this
levity
of
conscience
a
heaviness
of
soul
and
a
levity
of
conscience
that
could
make
him
talk
as
though
the
creeds
did
not
matter
as
though
nothing
mattered
if
only
he
could
smoke
he
was
persuaded
that
a
couple
of
egyptian
cigarettes
or
three
at
the
outside
a
day
would
do
wonders
in
restoring
his
nervous
calm
that
and
just
a
weak
whisky
and
soda
at
lunch
and
dinner
suppose
now
his
conscience
his
sense
of
honour
deserted
him
latterly
he
had
had
several
of
these
it
was
only
when
they
were
over
that
he
realized
that
they
had
occurred
one
might
smoke
up
the
chimney
he
reflected
but
he
had
no
cigarettes
perhaps
if
he
were
to
slip
downstairs
why
had
he
given
up
smoking
he
groaned
aloud
he
and
his
reflection
eyed
one
another
in
mutual
despair
there
came
before
his
memory
the
image
of
a
boy
face
a
swarthy
little
boy
grinning
grinning
with
a
horrible
knowingness
and
pointing
his
finger
an
accusing
finger
it
had
been
the
most
exasperating
humiliating
and
shameful
incident
in
the
bishop
career
it
was
the
afternoon
for
his
fortnightly
address
to
the
church
association
and
he
had
been
seized
with
a
panic
fear
entirely
irrational
and
unjustifiable
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
deliver
the
address
the
fear
had
arisen
after
lunch
had
gripped
his
mind
and
then
as
now
had
come
the
thought
if
only
i
could
smoke
and
he
had
smoked
it
seemed
better
to
break
a
vow
than
fail
the
association
he
had
fallen
to
the
temptation
with
a
completeness
that
now
filled
him
with
shame
and
horror
he
had
stalked
dunk
his
out
of
the
had
affected
to
need
a
book
from
the
beyond
the
sideboard
had
gone
insincerely
to
the
sideboard
humming
from
greenland
icy
mountains
and
then
glancing
over
his
shoulder
had
stolen
one
of
his
own
cigarettes
one
of
the
fatter
sort
with
this
and
his
bedroom
matches
he
had
gone
off
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
among
the
laurels
looked
everywhere
except
above
the
wall
to
be
sure
that
he
was
alone
and
at
last
lit
up
only
as
he
raised
his
eyes
in
gratitude
for
the
first
blissful
inhalation
to
discover
that
dreadful
little
boy
peeping
at
him
from
the
crotch
in
the
in
the
next
garden
as
though
god
had
sent
him
to
be
a
witness
their
eyes
had
met
the
bishop
recalled
with
an
agonized
distinctness
every
moment
every
error
of
that
shameful
encounter
he
had
been
too
surprised
to
conceal
the
state
of
affairs
from
the
pitiless
scrutiny
of
those
youthful
eyes
he
had
instantly
made
as
if
to
put
the
cigarette
behind
his
back
and
then
as
frankly
dropped
it
his
soul
would
not
be
more
naked
at
the
resurrection
the
little
boy
had
stared
realized
the
state
of
affairs
slowly
but
surely
pointed
his
finger
never
had
two
human
beings
understood
each
other
more
completely
a
dirty
little
boy
capable
no
doubt
of
a
thousand
kindred
scoundrelisms
it
seemed
ages
before
the
bishop
could
tear
himself
from
the
spot
and
walk
back
with
such
a
pretence
of
dignity
as
he
could
muster
to
the
house
and
instead
of
the
discourse
he
had
prepared
for
the
church
association
he
had
preached
on
temptation
and
falling
and
how
he
knew
they
had
all
fallen
and
how
he
understood
and
could
sympathize
with
the
bitterness
of
a
secret
shame
a
moving
but
unsuitable
discourse
that
had
already
been
subjected
to
misconstruction
and
severe
reproof
in
the
local
press
of
princhester
but
the
haunting
thing
in
the
bishop
memory
was
the
face
and
gesture
of
the
little
boy
that
grubby
little
finger
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
oh
god
he
groaned
the
meanness
of
it
how
did
i
bring
myself
he
turned
out
the
light
convulsively
and
rolled
over
in
the
bed
making
a
sort
of
cocoon
of
himself
he
bored
his
head
into
the
pillow
and
groaned
and
then
struggled
impatiently
to
throw
the
off
himself
then
he
sat
up
and
talked
aloud
i
must
go
to
he
said
and
get
a
medical
dispensation
if
i
do
not
smoke
he
paused
for
a
long
time
then
his
voice
sounded
again
in
the
darkness
speaking
quietly
speaking
with
a
note
almost
of
satisfaction
i
shall
go
mad
i
must
smoke
or
i
shall
go
for
a
long
time
he
sat
up
in
the
great
bed
with
his
arms
about
his
knees
fearful
things
came
to
him
things
at
once
dreadfully
blasphemous
and
entirely
the
triangle
and
the
eye
became
almost
visible
upon
the
black
background
of
night
they
were
very
angry
they
were
spinning
round
and
round
faster
and
faster
because
he
was
a
bishop
and
because
really
he
did
not
believe
fully
and
completely
in
the
trinity
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
did
not
believe
in
the
trinity
and
was
terrified
by
the
anger
of
the
trinity
at
his
unbelief
he
was
afraid
he
was
aghast
and
oh
he
was
weary
he
rubbed
his
eyes
if
i
could
have
a
cup
of
tea
he
said
then
he
perceived
with
surprise
that
he
had
not
thought
of
praying
what
should
he
say
to
what
could
he
pray
he
tried
not
to
think
of
that
whizzing
triangle
that
seemed
now
to
be
nailed
like
a
catherine
wheel
to
the
very
centre
of
his
forehead
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
be
at
the
apex
of
the
universe
against
that
for
protection
against
that
he
was
praying
it
was
by
a
great
effort
that
at
last
he
pronounced
the
words
lighten
our
darkness
we
beseech
thee
o
lord
presently
he
had
turned
up
his
light
and
was
prowling
about
the
room
the
clear
inky
dinginess
that
comes
before
the
raw
dawn
of
a
spring
morning
found
his
white
face
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
great
terrace
and
the
park
chapter
the
second
the
wear
and
tear
of
episcopacy
it
was
only
in
the
last
few
years
that
the
bishop
had
experienced
these
nervous
and
mental
crises
he
was
a
belated
doubter
whatever
questionings
had
marked
his
intellectual
adolescence
had
either
been
very
slight
or
had
been
too
adequately
answered
to
leave
any
serious
scars
upon
his
convictions
and
even
now
he
felt
that
he
was
afflicted
physically
rather
than
mentally
that
some
protective
padding
of
or
had
worn
thin
and
weak
and
left
him
a
prey
to
strange
disturbances
rather
than
that
any
new
process
of
thought
was
eating
into
his
mind
these
doubts
in
his
mind
were
still
not
really
doubts
they
were
rather
alien
and
for
the
first
time
uncontrolled
movements
of
his
intelligence
he
had
had
a
sheltered
upbringing
he
was
the
son
of
a
comfortable
rectory
the
only
son
and
sole
survivor
of
a
family
of
three
he
had
been
carefully
instructed
and
he
had
been
a
willing
learner
it
had
been
easy
and
natural
to
take
many
things
for
granted
it
had
been
very
easy
and
pleasant
for
him
to
take
the
world
as
he
found
it
and
god
as
he
found
him
indeed
for
all
his
years
up
to
manhood
he
had
been
able
to
take
life
exactly
as
in
his
infancy
he
took
his
carefully
warmed
and
prepared
bottle
unquestioningly
and
beneficially
and
indeed
that
has
been
the
way
with
most
bishops
since
bishops
began
it
is
a
busy
continuous
process
that
turns
boys
into
bishops
and
it
will
stand
few
jars
or
discords
the
student
of
ecclesiastical
biography
will
find
that
an
early
vocation
has
in
every
age
been
almost
universal
among
them
few
are
there
among
these
lives
that
do
not
display
the
incipient
bishop
from
the
tenderest
years
bishop
how
of
wakefield
composed
hymns
before
he
was
eleven
and
archbishop
benson
when
scarcely
older
possessed
a
little
oratory
in
which
he
conducted
services
and
a
pleasant
touch
of
the
more
secular
boy
which
he
protected
from
a
too
inquisitive
sister
by
means
of
a
booby
trap
it
is
rare
that
those
marked
for
episcopal
dignities
go
so
far
into
the
outer
world
as
archbishop
lang
of
york
who
began
as
a
barrister
this
early
predestination
has
always
been
the
common
episcopal
experience
archbishop
benson
early
attempts
at
religious
services
remind
one
both
of
thomas
a
becket
the
boy
bishop
and
those
early
ceremonies
of
athanasius
which
were
observed
and
inquired
upon
by
the
good
bishop
alexander
for
though
still
a
tender
infant
athanasius
with
perfect
correctness
and
validity
was
baptizing
a
number
of
his
innocent
playmates
and
the
bishop
who
had
paused
to
contemplate
the
sports
of
the
child
remained
to
confirm
the
zeal
of
the
and
as
with
the
bishop
of
the
past
so
with
the
bishop
of
the
future
the
rev
campbell
in
his
story
of
his
soul
pilgrimage
has
given
us
a
pleasant
picture
of
himself
as
a
child
stealing
out
into
the
woods
to
build
himself
a
little
altar
such
minds
as
these
settled
as
it
were
from
the
outset
are
either
incapable
of
real
scepticism
or
become
sceptical
only
after
catastrophic
changes
they
understand
the
sceptical
mind
with
difficulty
and
their
beliefs
are
regarded
by
the
sceptical
mind
with
incredulity
they
have
determined
their
forms
of
belief
before
their
years
of
discretion
and
once
those
forms
are
determined
they
are
not
very
easily
changed
within
the
shell
it
has
adopted
the
intelligence
may
be
active
and
lively
enough
may
indeed
be
extraordinarily
active
and
lively
but
only
within
the
shell
there
is
an
entire
difference
in
the
mental
quality
of
those
who
are
converts
to
a
faith
and
those
who
are
brought
up
in
it
the
former
know
it
from
outside
as
well
as
from
within
they
know
not
only
that
it
is
but
also
that
it
is
not
the
latter
have
a
confidence
in
their
creed
that
is
one
with
their
apprehension
of
sky
or
air
or
gravitation
it
is
a
primary
mental
structure
and
they
not
only
do
not
doubt
but
they
doubt
the
good
faith
of
those
who
do
they
think
that
the
atheist
and
agnostic
really
believe
but
are
impelled
by
a
mysterious
obstinacy
to
deny
so
it
had
been
with
the
bishop
of
princhester
not
of
cunning
or
design
but
in
simple
good
faith
he
had
accepted
all
the
inherited
assurances
of
his
native
rectory
and
held
by
church
crown
empire
decorum
respectability
solvency
and
compulsory
greek
at
the
little
go
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
if
in
his
undergraduate
days
he
had
said
a
thing
or
two
in
the
modern
vein
affected
the
socialism
of
william
morris
and
learnt
some
swinburne
by
heart
it
was
out
of
a
conscious
wildness
he
did
not
wish
to
be
a
prig
he
had
taken
a
far
more
genuine
interest
in
the
artistry
of
ritual
through
all
the
time
of
his
incumbency
of
the
church
of
the
holy
innocents
john
wood
and
of
his
career
as
the
bishop
suffragan
of
pinner
he
had
never
faltered
from
his
profound
confidence
in
those
standards
of
his
home
he
had
been
kind
popular
and
endlessly
active
his
undergraduate
socialism
had
expanded
simply
and
sincerely
into
a
theory
of
administrative
philanthropy
he
knew
the
webbs
he
was
as
successful
with
audiences
as
with
fashionable
congregations
his
home
life
with
lady
ella
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
fifth
earl
of
birkenholme
and
his
five
little
girls
was
simple
beautiful
and
happy
as
few
homes
are
in
these
days
of
confusion
until
he
became
bishop
of
princhester
he
followed
hood
the
first
bishop
as
the
reign
of
his
majesty
king
edward
the
peacemaker
drew
to
its
close
no
anticipation
of
his
coming
distress
fell
across
his
path
he
came
to
princhester
an
innocent
and
trustful
man
the
home
life
at
the
old
rectory
of
otteringham
was
still
his
standard
of
truth
and
reality
london
had
not
disillusioned
him
it
was
a
strange
waste
of
people
it
made
him
feel
like
a
missionary
in
infidel
parts
but
it
was
a
kindly
waste
it
was
neither
antagonistic
nor
malicious
he
had
always
felt
there
that
if
he
searched
his
londoner
to
the
bottom
he
would
find
the
completest
recognition
of
the
old
rectory
and
all
its
data
and
implications
but
princhester
was
different
princhester
made
one
think
that
recently
there
had
been
a
second
and
much
more
serious
fall
princhester
was
industrial
and
unashamed
it
was
a
countryside
savagely
invaded
by
forges
and
mine
shafts
and
gaunt
black
things
it
was
scarred
and
impeded
and
discoloured
even
before
that
invasion
when
the
heather
was
not
in
flower
it
must
have
been
a
black
country
its
people
were
dour
uncandid
individuals
who
slanted
their
heads
and
knitted
their
brows
to
look
at
you
occasionally
one
saw
woods
brown
and
blistered
by
the
gases
from
chemical
works
here
and
there
remained
old
rectories
closely
reminiscent
of
the
dear
old
home
at
otteringham
jostled
and
elbowed
and
overshadowed
by
horrible
iron
cylinders
belching
smoke
and
flame
the
fine
old
abbey
church
of
princhester
which
was
the
cathedral
of
the
new
diocese
looked
when
first
he
saw
it
like
a
lady
abbess
who
had
taken
to
drink
and
slept
in
a
coal
truck
she
minced
apologetically
upon
the
the
parvenu
town
hall
patronized
and
protected
her
as
if
she
were
a
poor
relation
the
old
aristocracy
of
the
countryside
was
unpicturesquely
decayed
the
branch
of
the
walshinghams
lady
ella
cousins
who
lived
near
pringle
was
poor
proud
and
ignoble
and
extremely
unpopular
the
rich
people
of
the
country
were
and
inclined
to
nonconformity
the
were
not
strictly
speaking
a
poor
they
were
highly
paid
badly
housed
and
deeply
resentful
they
went
in
vast
droves
to
football
matches
and
did
not
care
a
rap
if
it
rained
the
prevailing
wind
was
sarcastic
to
come
here
from
london
was
to
come
from
atmospheric
to
from
smoke
and
soft
smut
to
grime
and
black
grimness
the
bishop
had
been
charmed
by
the
historical
associations
of
princhester
when
first
the
see
was
put
before
his
mind
his
realization
of
his
diocese
was
a
profound
shock
only
one
hint
had
he
had
of
what
was
coming
he
had
met
during
his
season
of
congratulations
lord
gatling
dining
unusually
at
the
athenaeum
lord
gatling
and
he
did
not
talk
frequently
but
on
this
occasion
the
great
racing
peer
came
over
to
him
you
will
feel
like
a
cherub
in
a
stokehole
lord
gatling
had
said
they
used
to
heave
lumps
of
slag
at
old
hood
gaiters
said
lord
gatling
in
london
a
bishop
a
lord
and
a
lark
and
nobody
minds
him
said
lord
gatling
but
princhester
is
different
it
is
used
to
bishops
well
i
hope
you
get
to
like
trouble
began
with
a
fearful
row
about
the
position
of
the
palace
hood
had
always
evaded
this
question
and
a
number
of
men
of
wealth
and
influence
full
of
local
patriotism
and
that
competitive
spirit
which
has
made
england
what
it
is
already
intensely
irritated
by
hood
prevarications
were
resolved
to
pin
his
successor
to
an
immediate
decision
of
this
the
new
bishop
was
unaware
mindful
of
a
bishop
constant
need
to
travel
he
was
disposed
to
seek
a
home
within
easy
reach
of
pringle
junction
from
which
nearly
every
point
in
the
diocese
could
be
simply
and
easily
reached
this
fell
in
with
lady
ella
liking
for
the
rare
rural
quiet
of
the
kibe
valley
and
the
neighbourhood
of
her
cousins
the
walshinghams
unhappily
it
did
not
fall
in
with
the
inflexible
resolution
of
each
and
every
one
of
the
six
leading
towns
of
the
see
to
put
up
own
obtrude
boast
and
swagger
about
the
biggest
and
showiest
thing
in
episcopal
palaces
in
all
industrial
england
and
the
new
bishop
had
already
taken
a
short
lease
and
gone
some
way
towards
the
acquisition
of
ganford
house
two
miles
from
pringle
before
he
realized
the
strength
and
fury
of
these
local
ambitions
at
first
the
magnates
and
influences
seemed
to
be
fighting
only
among
themselves
and
he
was
so
as
to
broach
the
ganford
house
project
as
a
compromise
that
would
glorify
no
one
unfairly
and
leave
the
erection
of
an
episcopal
palace
for
some
future
date
when
he
perhaps
would
have
the
good
fortune
to
have
passed
to
where
beyond
these
voices
there
is
peace
forgetting
altogether
among
other
oversights
the
importance
of
architects
and
builders
in
local
affairs
his
proposal
seemed
for
a
time
to
concentrate
the
rich
passions
of
the
whole
countryside
upon
himself
and
his
wife
because
they
did
not
leave
lady
ella
alone
the
walshinghams
were
already
unpopular
in
their
county
on
account
of
a
poverty
and
shyness
that
made
them
seem
stuck
up
to
successful
captains
of
industry
only
too
ready
with
the
hand
of
friendship
the
iron
grip
indeed
of
friendship
consciously
hospitable
and
eager
for
admission
and
endorsements
and
princhester
in
particular
was
under
the
sway
of
that
enterprising
weekly
the
white
blackbird
which
was
illustrated
by
which
indeed
monopolized
the
gifts
of
that
brilliant
young
caricaturist
the
it
had
seemed
natural
for
lady
ella
to
acquiesce
in
the
proposals
of
the
leading
princhester
photographer
she
had
always
helped
where
she
could
in
her
husband
public
work
and
she
had
been
popular
upon
her
own
merits
in
wealdstone
the
portrait
was
abominable
enough
in
itself
it
dwelt
on
her
chin
doubled
her
age
and
denied
her
gentleness
but
it
was
a
mere
for
the
subtle
extravagance
of
the
poisonous
gift
the
thing
came
upon
the
bishop
suddenly
from
the
at
pringle
junction
he
kept
it
carefully
from
lady
ella
it
was
only
later
that
he
found
that
a
copy
of
the
white
blackbird
had
been
sent
to
her
and
that
she
was
keeping
the
horror
from
him
it
was
in
her
vein
that
she
should
reproach
herself
for
being
a
vulnerable
side
to
him
even
when
the
bishop
capitulated
in
favour
of
princhester
that
decision
only
opened
a
fresh
trouble
for
him
princhester
wanted
the
palace
to
be
a
palace
it
wanted
to
combine
all
the
best
points
of
lambeth
and
fulham
with
the
marble
splendours
of
a
good
modern
bank
the
architectural
tastes
on
the
other
hand
were
rationalistic
he
was
all
for
building
a
useful
palace
in
undertones
with
a
green
slate
roof
and
long
horizontal
lines
what
he
wanted
more
than
anything
else
was
a
quite
remote
wing
with
a
lot
of
bright
little
bedrooms
and
a
and
so
on
complete
in
itself
examination
hall
and
everything
with
a
long
intricate
connecting
passage
and
several
doors
to
prevent
the
ordination
candidates
straying
all
over
the
place
and
getting
into
the
talk
and
the
tea
but
the
diocese
wanted
a
proud
archway
and
turrets
and
did
not
care
a
rap
if
the
ordination
candidates
slept
about
on
the
carpets
in
the
bishop
bedroom
ordination
candidates
were
quite
outside
the
sphere
of
its
imagination
and
he
disappointed
princhester
with
his
equipage
princhester
had
a
feeling
that
it
deserved
more
for
coming
over
to
the
church
from
nonconformity
as
it
was
doing
it
wanted
a
bishop
in
a
mitre
and
a
gilt
coach
it
wanted
a
pastoral
crook
it
wanted
something
to
go
with
its
mace
and
its
mayor
and
obsessed
by
the
snicker
it
wanted
less
of
lady
ella
the
cruelty
and
unreason
of
these
attacks
upon
his
wife
distressed
the
bishop
beyond
measure
and
baffled
him
hopelessly
he
could
not
see
any
means
of
checking
them
nor
of
defending
or
justifying
her
against
them
the
palace
was
awaiting
its
tenant
but
the
controversies
and
bitternesses
were
still
swinging
and
swaying
and
developing
when
king
george
was
being
crowned
close
upon
that
event
came
a
wave
of
social
discontent
the
great
railway
strike
a
curious
sense
of
social
and
political
instability
and
the
first
beginnings
of
the
bishop
ill
health
there
came
a
day
of
exceptional
fatigue
and
significance
the
industrial
trouble
was
a
very
real
distress
to
the
bishop
he
had
a
firm
belief
that
it
is
a
function
of
the
church
to
act
as
mediator
between
employer
and
employed
it
was
a
common
saying
of
his
that
the
aim
of
socialism
the
right
sort
of
socialism
was
to
christianize
employment
regardless
of
suspicion
on
either
hand
regardless
of
very
distinct
hints
that
he
should
mind
his
own
business
he
exerted
himself
in
a
search
for
methods
of
reconciliation
he
sought
out
every
one
who
seemed
likely
to
be
influential
on
either
side
and
did
his
utmost
to
discover
the
conditions
of
a
settlement
as
far
as
possible
and
with
the
help
of
a
not
very
efficient
chaplain
he
tried
to
combine
such
interviews
with
his
more
normal
visiting
at
times
and
this
was
particularly
the
case
on
this
day
he
seemed
to
be
discovering
nothing
but
the
incurable
perversity
and
militancy
of
human
nature
it
was
a
day
under
an
east
wind
when
a
sky
full
of
colourless
light
filled
a
world
with
whitish
high
lights
and
inky
shadows
these
bright
harsh
days
of
barometric
high
pressure
in
england
rouse
and
thwart
every
expectation
of
the
happiness
of
spring
and
as
the
bishop
drove
through
the
afternoon
in
a
hired
fly
along
a
rutted
road
of
slag
between
fields
that
were
bitterly
wired
against
the
sunday
trespasser
he
fell
into
a
despondent
meditation
upon
the
political
and
social
outlook
his
thoughts
were
of
a
sort
not
uncommon
in
those
days
the
world
was
strangely
restless
since
the
passing
of
victoria
the
great
there
had
been
an
accumulating
uneasiness
in
the
national
life
it
was
as
if
some
compact
and
dignified
had
been
lifted
from
people
ideas
and
as
if
at
once
they
had
begun
to
blow
about
anyhow
not
that
queen
victoria
had
really
been
a
or
any
weight
at
all
but
it
happened
that
she
died
as
an
epoch
closed
an
epoch
of
tremendous
stabilities
her
son
already
elderly
had
followed
as
the
selvedge
follows
the
piece
he
had
passed
and
left
the
new
age
stripped
bare
in
nearly
every
department
of
economic
and
social
life
now
there
was
upheaval
and
it
was
an
upheaval
very
different
in
character
from
the
radicalism
and
liberalism
of
the
victorian
days
there
were
not
only
doubt
and
denial
but
now
there
were
also
impatience
and
unreason
people
argued
less
and
acted
quicker
there
was
a
pride
in
rebellion
for
its
own
sake
an
indiscipline
and
disposition
to
sporadic
violence
that
made
it
extremely
hard
to
negotiate
any
reconciliations
or
compromises
behind
every
extremist
it
seemed
stood
a
further
extremist
prepared
to
go
one
better
the
bishop
had
spent
most
of
the
morning
with
one
of
the
big
employers
a
tall
dark
man
lean
and
nervous
and
obviously
tired
and
worried
by
the
struggle
he
did
not
conceal
his
opinion
that
the
church
was
meddling
with
matters
quite
outside
its
sphere
never
had
it
been
conveyed
to
the
bishop
before
how
remote
a
rich
and
established
englishman
could
consider
the
church
from
reality
you
got
no
hold
on
them
he
said
it
is
your
and
again
they
listen
to
you
if
you
speak
well
but
they
believe
you
know
anything
about
it
and
they
do
trust
your
good
intentions
they
wo
mind
a
bit
what
you
say
unless
you
drop
something
they
can
use
against
the
bishop
tried
a
few
phrases
he
thought
there
might
be
something
in
in
in
some
more
permanent
relationship
between
the
business
and
the
employee
there
is
said
the
employer
compactly
it
just
the
malice
of
being
inferior
against
the
man
in
control
it
just
the
spirit
of
insubordination
and
boredom
with
duty
this
trouble
as
old
as
the
but
that
is
exactly
the
business
of
the
church
said
the
bishop
brightly
to
reconcile
men
to
their
by
chanting
the
athanasian
creed
at
i
suppose
said
the
big
employer
betraying
the
sneer
he
had
been
hiding
hitherto
this
thing
is
a
fight
said
the
big
employer
carrying
on
before
the
bishop
could
reply
religion
had
better
get
out
of
the
streets
until
this
thing
is
over
the
men
wo
listen
to
reason
they
do
mean
to
they
bit
by
syndicalism
they
setting
out
i
tell
you
to
be
unreasonable
and
impossible
it
is
an
argument
it
a
fight
they
do
want
to
make
friends
with
the
employer
they
want
to
make
an
end
to
the
employer
whatever
we
give
them
they
take
and
press
us
for
more
directly
we
make
terms
with
the
leaders
the
men
go
behind
it
it
a
raid
on
the
whole
system
they
do
mean
to
work
the
system
anyhow
i
the
capitalist
and
the
capitalist
has
to
go
i
to
be
bundled
out
of
my
works
and
some
some
he
seemed
to
be
rejecting
unsuitable
words
confounded
politician
put
in
much
good
it
would
do
them
but
before
that
happens
i
going
to
fight
you
the
bishop
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
staring
at
the
brilliant
spring
bulbs
in
the
big
employer
garden
and
at
a
long
vista
of
lawn
under
great
shapely
trees
just
budding
into
green
i
ca
admit
he
said
that
these
troubles
lie
outside
the
sphere
of
the
the
employer
came
and
stood
beside
him
he
felt
he
was
being
a
little
hard
on
the
bishop
but
he
could
not
see
any
way
of
making
things
easier
one
does
want
sacred
things
he
tried
in
a
scrap
like
this
we
got
to
mend
things
or
end
things
continued
the
big
employer
nothing
goes
on
for
ever
things
ca
last
as
they
are
going
on
now
then
he
went
on
abruptly
to
something
that
for
a
time
he
had
been
keeping
back
of
course
just
at
present
the
church
may
do
a
confounded
lot
of
harm
some
of
you
clerical
gentlemen
are
rather
too
fond
of
talking
socialism
and
even
preaching
socialism
do
think
i
want
to
be
overcritical
i
admit
there
no
end
of
things
to
be
said
for
a
proper
sort
of
socialism
ruskin
and
all
that
we
all
socialists
nowadays
ideals
excellent
but
it
gets
misunderstood
it
gives
the
men
a
sense
of
moral
support
it
makes
them
fancy
that
they
are
it
encourages
them
to
forget
duties
and
set
up
preposterous
claims
class
war
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
gentlemen
of
the
clergy
do
quite
realize
that
socialism
may
begin
with
ruskin
and
end
with
karl
marx
and
that
from
the
class
war
to
the
commune
is
just
one
from
this
conversation
the
bishop
had
made
his
way
to
the
vicarage
of
mogham
banks
the
vicar
of
mogham
banks
was
a
sacerdotal
socialist
of
the
most
advanced
type
with
the
reputation
of
being
closely
in
touch
with
the
labour
extremists
he
was
a
man
addicted
to
banners
prohibited
ornaments
special
services
at
unusual
hours
and
processions
in
the
streets
his
taste
in
chasubles
was
loud
he
gardened
in
a
cassock
and
it
was
said
he
slept
in
his
biretta
he
certainly
slept
in
a
hair
shirt
and
he
littered
his
church
with
flowers
candles
side
altars
confessional
boxes
requests
for
prayers
for
the
departed
and
the
like
there
had
already
been
two
kensitite
demonstrations
at
his
services
and
altogether
he
was
a
source
of
considerable
anxiety
to
the
bishop
the
bishop
did
his
best
not
to
know
too
exactly
what
was
going
on
at
mogham
banks
sooner
or
later
he
felt
he
would
be
forced
to
do
something
and
the
longer
he
could
put
that
off
the
better
but
the
rev
morrice
deans
had
promised
to
get
together
three
or
four
prominent
labour
leaders
for
tea
and
a
frank
talk
and
the
opportunity
was
one
not
to
be
missed
so
the
bishop
after
a
hasty
and
not
too
digestible
lunch
in
the
refreshment
room
at
pringle
was
now
in
a
fly
that
smelt
of
straw
and
suggested
infectious
hospital
patients
on
his
way
through
the
countryside
to
this
second
conversation
the
countryside
had
never
seemed
so
scarred
to
him
as
it
did
that
day
it
was
probably
the
bright
hard
spring
sunshine
that
emphasized
the
contrast
between
that
dear
england
of
hedges
and
homes
and
the
wind
in
which
his
imagination
lived
and
the
crude
presences
of
a
mechanical
age
never
before
had
the
cuttings
and
heapings
the
smashing
down
of
trees
the
obtrusion
of
corrugated
iron
and
tar
the
belchings
of
smoke
and
the
haste
seemed
so
harsh
and
disregardful
of
all
the
bishop
world
across
the
fields
a
line
of
gaunt
iron
standards
abominably
designed
carried
an
electric
cable
to
some
unknown
end
the
curve
of
the
hill
made
them
seem
a
little
out
of
the
straight
as
if
they
hurried
and
bent
forward
furtively
where
are
they
going
asked
the
bishop
leaning
forward
to
look
out
of
the
window
of
the
fly
and
then
where
is
it
all
going
and
presently
the
road
was
under
repair
and
was
being
done
at
a
great
pace
with
a
huge
mechanically
smashed
granite
and
kettles
of
stinking
stuff
asphalt
or
something
of
that
sort
that
looked
and
smelt
like
milton
hell
beyond
a
gaunt
hoarding
advertised
extensively
the
princhester
music
hall
a
mean
beastly
place
that
corrupted
boys
and
girls
and
also
it
clamoured
of
tyres
and
potted
meats
the
afternoon
conference
gave
him
no
reassuring
answer
to
his
question
where
is
it
all
going
the
afternoon
conference
did
no
more
than
intensify
the
new
and
strange
sense
of
alienation
from
the
world
that
the
morning
talk
had
evoked
the
three
labour
extremists
that
morrice
deans
had
assembled
obviously
liked
the
bishop
and
found
him
picturesque
and
were
not
above
a
certain
snobbish
gratification
at
the
company
they
were
in
but
it
was
clear
that
they
regarded
his
intervention
in
the
great
dispute
as
if
it
were
a
feeble
waving
from
the
bank
across
the
waters
of
a
great
river
there
an
incurable
misunderstanding
between
the
modern
employer
and
the
modern
employed
the
chief
labour
spokesman
said
speaking
in
a
broad
accent
that
completely
hid
from
him
and
the
bishop
and
every
one
the
fact
that
he
was
by
far
the
man
of
the
party
disraeli
called
them
the
two
nations
but
that
was
long
ago
now
it
a
case
of
two
species
machinery
has
made
them
into
different
species
the
employer
lives
away
from
his
marries
a
wife
foreign
out
of
a
county
family
or
suchlike
trains
his
children
from
their
very
birth
in
a
different
manner
why
the
growth
curve
is
different
for
the
two
species
they
have
even
a
common
speech
between
them
one
looks
east
and
the
other
looks
west
how
can
you
expect
them
to
agree
of
course
they
wo
agree
we
got
to
fight
it
out
they
say
we
their
slaves
for
ever
have
you
ever
read
lady
bell
the
works
a
woman
but
she
gives
the
whole
thing
away
we
say
no
it
our
sort
and
not
your
sort
we
do
without
you
we
get
a
little
more
education
and
then
we
do
without
you
we
pressing
for
all
we
can
get
and
when
we
got
that
we
take
breath
and
press
for
more
we
the
morlocks
coming
up
it
is
our
fault
that
but
you
have
understood
the
drift
of
christianity
said
the
bishop
it
just
to
assert
that
men
are
one
community
and
not
there
not
much
of
that
in
the
creeds
said
a
second
labour
leader
who
was
a
rationalist
there
not
much
of
that
in
the
services
of
the
the
vicar
spoke
before
his
bishop
and
indeed
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
speak
before
his
bishop
because
you
will
not
set
yourselves
to
understand
the
symbolism
of
her
ritual
he
said
if
the
church
chooses
to
speak
in
riddles
said
the
rationalist
symbols
said
morrice
deans
need
not
be
riddles
and
for
a
time
the
talk
eddied
about
this
minor
issue
and
the
chief
labour
spokesman
and
the
bishop
looked
at
one
another
the
vicar
instanced
and
explained
certain
apparently
insignificant
observances
his
antagonist
was
contemptuously
polite
to
these
explanations
that
all
very
pratty
he
said
the
bishop
wished
that
fine
points
of
ceremonial
might
have
been
left
out
of
the
discussion
something
much
bigger
than
that
was
laying
hold
of
his
intelligence
the
realization
of
a
world
extravagantly
out
of
hand
the
sky
the
wind
the
telegraph
poles
had
been
jabbing
in
the
harsh
lesson
of
these
voices
that
the
church
as
people
say
was
in
and
that
at
the
same
time
the
church
held
the
one
remedy
for
all
this
ugliness
and
contention
in
its
teaching
of
the
universal
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
universal
brotherhood
of
men
only
for
some
reason
he
had
the
phrases
and
he
had
the
voice
to
assert
this
over
their
wrangling
and
their
stiff
resolution
he
wanted
to
think
the
whole
business
out
thoroughly
for
the
moment
he
had
nothing
to
say
and
there
was
the
labour
leader
opposite
waiting
smilingly
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
so
soon
as
the
bout
between
the
vicar
and
the
rationalist
was
over
that
morning
in
the
long
galleries
of
the
bishop
imagination
a
fresh
painting
had
been
added
it
was
a
big
wall
painting
rather
in
the
manner
of
puvis
de
chavannes
and
the
central
figure
had
been
the
bishop
of
princhester
himself
he
had
been
standing
upon
the
steps
of
the
great
door
of
the
cathedral
that
looks
upon
the
marketplace
where
the
meet
and
he
had
been
dressed
very
magnificently
and
rather
after
the
older
use
he
had
been
wearing
a
tunicle
and
dalmatic
under
a
chasuble
a
pectoral
cross
purple
gloves
sandals
and
buskins
a
mitre
and
his
presentation
ring
in
his
hand
he
had
borne
his
pastoral
staff
and
the
clustering
pillars
and
arches
of
the
great
doorway
were
painted
with
a
loving
flat
particularity
that
omitted
nothing
but
the
sooty
tinge
of
the
later
discolourations
on
his
right
hand
had
stood
a
group
of
employers
very
richly
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
on
the
left
a
rather
more
numerous
group
of
less
decorative
artisans
with
them
their
wives
and
children
had
been
shown
all
greatly
impressed
by
the
canonicals
every
one
had
been
extremely
respectful
he
had
been
reconciling
the
people
and
blessing
them
and
calling
them
his
sheep
and
his
little
but
all
this
was
so
different
neither
party
resembled
sheep
or
little
children
in
the
least
degree
the
labour
leader
became
impatient
with
the
ritualistic
controversy
he
set
his
aside
out
of
danger
and
leant
across
the
corner
of
the
table
to
the
bishop
and
spoke
in
a
sawing
undertone
you
see
he
said
the
church
does
not
talk
our
language
i
doubt
if
it
understands
our
language
i
doubt
if
we
understand
clearly
where
we
are
ourselves
these
things
have
to
be
fought
out
and
hammered
out
it
a
big
dusty
dirty
noisy
job
it
may
be
a
bloody
job
before
it
through
you
suddenly
call
a
halt
in
the
middle
of
the
scrap
and
have
a
sort
of
millennium
just
because
you
want
it
of
course
if
the
church
had
a
plan
he
said
if
it
had
a
proposal
to
make
if
it
had
anything
more
than
a
few
pious
palliatives
to
suggest
that
might
be
different
but
has
it
the
bishop
had
a
bankrupt
feeling
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
could
say
no
more
than
it
offers
its
full
as
he
was
with
the
preoccupation
of
these
things
and
so
a
little
slow
and
inattentive
in
his
movements
the
bishop
had
his
usual
luck
at
pringle
junction
and
just
missed
the
for
princhester
he
might
perhaps
have
got
it
by
running
through
the
subway
and
pushing
past
people
but
bishops
must
not
run
through
subways
and
push
past
people
his
mind
swore
at
the
mischance
even
if
his
lips
refrained
he
was
hungry
and
tired
he
would
not
get
to
the
palace
now
until
long
after
nine
dinner
would
be
over
and
lady
ella
would
naturally
suppose
he
had
dined
early
with
the
rev
morrice
deans
very
probably
there
would
be
nothing
ready
for
him
at
all
he
tried
to
think
he
was
exercising
but
indeed
all
his
self
was
busy
in
a
manner
that
would
not
have
disgraced
tertullian
with
the
eternal
welfare
of
those
city
fathers
whose
obstinacy
had
fixed
the
palace
at
princhester
he
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
gripping
his
hands
very
tightly
behind
him
and
maintaining
a
serene
upcast
countenance
by
a
steadfast
effort
it
seemed
a
small
matter
to
him
that
the
placards
of
the
local
evening
papers
should
proclaim
lloyd
george
reconciliation
meeting
at
wombash
broken
up
by
for
a
year
now
he
had
observed
a
strict
rule
against
buying
the
products
of
the
local
press
and
he
saw
no
reason
for
varying
this
protective
regulation
his
mind
was
full
of
angry
helplessness
was
he
to
blame
was
the
church
to
blame
for
its
powerlessness
in
these
social
disputes
could
an
abler
man
with
a
readier
eloquence
have
done
more
he
envied
the
cleverness
of
cardinal
manning
manning
would
have
got
right
into
the
front
of
this
affair
he
would
have
accumulated
credit
for
his
church
and
himself
but
would
he
have
done
much
the
bishop
wandered
along
the
platform
to
its
end
and
stood
contemplating
the
convergent
ways
that
gather
together
beyond
the
station
and
plunge
into
the
hillside
and
the
wilderness
of
sidings
and
trucks
huts
electric
standards
goods
sheds
turntables
and
that
ends
in
a
bluish
cliff
against
the
hill
a
train
rushed
with
a
roar
and
clatter
into
the
throat
of
the
great
tunnel
and
was
immediately
silenced
its
rear
lights
twinkled
and
vanished
and
then
out
of
that
huge
black
throat
came
wisps
of
white
steam
and
curled
slowly
upward
like
lazy
snakes
until
they
caught
the
slanting
sunshine
for
the
first
time
the
day
betrayed
a
softness
and
touched
this
scene
of
black
energy
to
gold
all
late
afternoons
are
beautiful
whatever
the
day
has
been
if
only
there
is
a
gleam
of
sun
and
now
a
kind
of
mechanical
greatness
took
the
place
of
mere
black
disorder
in
the
bishop
perception
of
his
see
it
was
harsh
it
was
vast
and
strong
it
was
no
lamb
he
had
to
rule
but
a
dragon
would
it
ever
be
given
to
him
to
overcome
his
dragon
to
lead
it
home
and
bless
it
he
stood
at
the
very
end
of
the
platform
with
his
gaitered
legs
wide
apart
and
his
hands
folded
behind
him
staring
beyond
all
visible
things
should
he
do
something
very
bold
and
striking
should
he
invite
both
men
and
masters
to
the
cathedral
and
preach
tremendous
sermons
to
them
upon
these
living
issues
short
sermons
of
course
but
stating
the
church
attitude
with
a
new
and
convincing
vigour
he
had
a
vision
of
the
great
aisle
strangely
full
and
alive
and
astir
the
organ
notes
still
echoed
in
the
fretted
vaulting
as
the
preacher
made
his
way
from
the
chancel
to
the
pulpit
the
congregation
was
tense
with
expectation
and
for
some
reason
his
mind
dwelt
for
a
long
time
upon
the
figure
of
the
preacher
ascending
the
steps
of
the
pulpit
outside
the
day
was
dark
and
stormy
so
that
the
windows
looked
absolutely
dead
for
a
little
while
the
preacher
prayed
then
in
the
attentive
silence
the
tenor
of
the
preacher
would
begin
a
thin
jet
of
sound
a
ray
of
light
in
the
darkness
speaking
to
all
these
men
as
they
had
never
been
spoken
to
before
surely
so
one
might
call
a
halt
to
all
these
harsh
conflicts
so
one
might
lay
hands
afresh
upon
these
stubborn
minds
one
might
win
them
round
to
look
at
christ
the
master
and
servant
that
he
thought
would
be
a
good
phrase
christ
the
master
and
members
of
one
body
that
should
be
his
text
at
last
it
was
finished
the
big
congregation
which
had
kept
so
still
sighed
and
stirred
the
task
of
reconciliation
was
as
good
as
done
and
now
to
god
the
father
god
the
son
and
god
the
holy
ghost
outside
the
day
had
become
suddenly
bright
the
threatening
storm
had
drifted
away
and
great
shafts
of
coloured
light
from
the
pictured
windows
were
smiting
like
arrows
amidst
his
hearers
this
idea
of
a
great
sermon
upon
capital
and
labour
did
so
powerfully
grip
the
bishop
imagination
that
he
came
near
to
losing
the
train
also
he
discovered
it
when
it
was
already
in
the
station
he
had
to
walk
down
the
platform
very
quickly
he
did
not
run
but
his
gaiters
he
felt
twinkled
more
than
a
bishop
should
directly
he
met
his
wife
he
realized
that
he
had
to
hear
something
important
and
unpleasant
she
stood
waiting
for
him
in
the
inner
hall
looking
very
grave
and
still
the
light
fell
upon
her
pale
face
and
her
dark
hair
and
her
long
white
silken
dress
making
her
seem
more
delicate
and
unworldly
than
usual
and
making
the
bishop
feel
grimy
and
sordid
i
must
have
a
wash
he
said
though
before
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
food
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
and
that
was
mostly
lady
ella
considered
there
are
cold
things
you
shall
have
a
tray
in
the
study
not
in
the
eleanor
is
there
i
want
to
tell
you
something
but
go
upstairs
first
and
wash
your
poor
tired
nothing
serious
i
hope
he
asked
struck
by
an
unusual
quality
in
her
voice
i
will
tell
you
she
evaded
and
after
a
moment
of
mutual
scrutiny
he
went
past
her
upstairs
since
they
had
come
to
princhester
lady
ella
had
changed
very
markedly
she
seemed
to
her
husband
to
have
gained
in
dignity
she
was
stiller
and
more
restrained
a
certain
faint
arrogance
a
touch
of
the
ruling
class
manner
had
dwindled
almost
to
the
vanishing
point
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
had
inclined
to
an
authoritative
hauteur
when
she
had
seemed
likely
to
develop
into
one
of
those
aggressive
and
interfering
old
ladies
who
play
so
overwhelming
a
part
in
british
public
affairs
she
had
been
known
to
initiate
adverse
judgments
to
exercise
the
snub
to
cut
and
humiliate
princhester
had
done
much
to
purge
her
of
such
tendencies
princhester
had
made
her
think
abundantly
and
had
put
a
new
and
subtler
quality
into
her
beauty
it
had
taken
away
the
least
little
disposition
to
rustle
as
she
moved
and
it
had
softened
her
voice
now
when
presently
she
stood
in
the
study
she
showed
a
new
circumspection
in
her
treatment
of
her
husband
she
surveyed
the
tray
before
him
you
ought
not
to
drink
that
burgundy
she
said
i
can
see
you
are
it
was
uncorked
yesterday
and
anyhow
it
is
not
very
digestible
this
cold
meat
is
bad
enough
you
ought
to
have
one
of
those
quarter
bottles
of
champagne
you
got
for
my
last
convalescence
more
than
a
dozen
left
the
bishop
felt
that
this
was
a
pretty
return
of
his
own
kindly
thoughts
after
many
days
and
soon
dunk
his
was
pouring
out
the
precious
and
refreshing
glassful
and
now
dear
said
the
bishop
feeling
already
much
better
lady
ella
had
come
round
to
the
marble
fireplace
the
was
a
handsome
work
by
a
princhester
artist
in
the
gill
style
with
contemplative
ascetics
as
supporters
i
am
worried
about
eleanor
said
lady
ella
she
is
in
the
now
she
said
having
some
dinner
she
came
in
about
a
quarter
past
eight
half
way
through
where
had
she
been
asked
the
bishop
her
dress
was
torn
in
two
places
her
wrist
had
been
twisted
and
a
little
my
dear
her
face
grubby
and
she
had
been
but
my
dear
what
had
happened
to
her
you
do
mean
husband
and
wife
stared
at
one
another
aghast
neither
of
them
said
the
horrid
word
that
flamed
between
them
merciful
heaven
said
the
bishop
and
assumed
an
attitude
of
despair
i
did
know
she
knew
any
of
them
but
it
seems
it
is
the
second
walshingham
girl
phoebe
it
impossible
to
trace
a
girl
thoughts
and
friends
she
persuaded
her
to
but
did
she
understand
that
the
serious
thing
said
lady
ella
she
seemed
to
consider
whether
he
could
bear
the
blow
she
understands
all
sorts
of
things
she
argues
i
am
quite
unable
to
argue
with
about
this
vote
business
about
all
sorts
of
things
things
i
did
imagine
she
had
heard
of
i
knew
she
had
been
reading
books
but
i
never
imagined
that
she
could
have
understood
the
bishop
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
one
may
read
in
books
one
may
even
talk
of
things
without
fully
understanding
he
said
lady
ella
tried
to
entertain
this
comforting
thought
it
is
like
that
she
said
at
last
she
talks
like
a
person
this
this
escapade
is
just
an
accident
but
things
have
gone
further
than
that
she
seems
to
think
that
she
is
not
being
educated
properly
here
that
she
ought
to
go
to
a
college
as
if
we
were
keeping
things
from
her
the
bishop
reconsidered
his
plate
but
what
things
he
said
she
says
we
get
all
round
her
said
lady
ella
and
left
the
implications
of
that
phrase
to
unfold
for
a
time
the
bishop
said
very
little
lady
ella
had
found
it
necessary
to
make
her
first
announcement
standing
behind
him
upon
the
hearthrug
but
now
she
sat
upon
the
arm
of
the
great
armchair
as
close
to
him
as
possible
and
spoke
in
a
more
familiar
tone
the
thing
she
said
had
come
to
her
as
a
complete
surprise
everything
had
seemed
so
safe
eleanor
had
been
thoughtful
it
was
true
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
mother
that
she
had
really
been
thinking
about
such
things
as
she
had
been
thinking
about
she
had
ranged
in
the
library
and
displayed
a
disposition
to
read
the
weekly
papers
and
the
monthly
reviews
but
never
a
sign
of
discontent
but
i
do
understand
said
the
bishop
why
is
she
discontented
what
is
there
that
she
wants
different
exactly
said
lady
ella
she
has
got
this
idea
that
life
here
is
secluded
in
some
way
she
expanded
she
used
words
like
and
and
what
was
it
and
she
said
lady
ella
paused
with
an
effect
of
exact
retrospection
there
she
said
are
alive
real
things
are
happening
it
is
almost
as
if
she
did
not
fully
believe
lady
ella
paused
again
the
bishop
sat
with
his
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
his
face
downcast
the
ferment
of
youth
he
said
at
last
the
ferment
of
youth
who
has
given
her
these
ideas
lady
ella
did
not
know
she
could
have
thought
a
school
like
aubyns
would
have
been
safe
but
nowadays
nothing
was
safe
it
was
clear
the
girls
who
went
there
talked
as
girls
a
generation
ago
did
not
talk
their
people
at
home
encouraged
them
to
talk
and
profess
opinions
about
everything
it
seemed
that
phoebe
walshingham
and
lady
kitty
kingdom
were
the
leaders
in
these
premature
mental
excursions
phoebe
aired
religious
doubts
but
little
phoebe
said
the
bishop
kitty
said
lady
ella
has
written
a
already
with
elopements
in
it
and
all
sorts
of
things
she
had
it
typed
you
think
mary
crosshampton
would
know
better
than
to
let
her
daughter
go
flourishing
the
family
imagination
about
in
that
eleanor
told
you
by
way
of
showing
that
they
think
of
things
in
the
bishop
reflected
she
wants
to
go
to
they
want
to
go
in
a
i
wonder
if
college
can
be
much
worse
than
school
she
eighteen
but
i
will
talk
to
her
all
our
children
are
changelings
they
are
perpetually
fresh
strangers
every
day
they
vanish
and
a
new
person
masquerades
as
yesterday
child
until
some
unexpected
development
betrays
the
cheat
the
bishop
had
still
to
learn
this
perennial
newness
of
the
young
he
learnt
it
in
half
an
hour
at
the
end
of
a
fatiguing
day
he
went
into
the
he
went
in
as
carelessly
as
possible
and
smoking
a
cigarette
he
had
an
honourable
dread
of
being
portentous
in
his
family
almost
ostentatiously
he
laid
the
bishop
aside
eleanor
had
finished
her
meal
and
was
sitting
in
the
by
the
fire
with
one
hand
holding
her
sprained
wrist
well
he
said
and
strolled
to
the
hearthrug
he
had
had
an
odd
idea
that
he
would
find
her
still
dirty
torn
and
tearful
as
her
mother
had
described
her
a
little
girl
in
a
scrape
but
she
had
changed
into
her
best
white
evening
frock
and
put
up
her
hair
and
became
in
the
firelight
more
of
a
lady
a
very
young
lady
but
still
a
lady
than
she
had
ever
been
to
him
before
she
was
dark
like
her
mother
but
not
of
the
same
willowy
type
she
had
more
of
her
father
sturdy
build
and
she
had
developed
her
shoulders
at
hockey
and
tennis
the
firelight
brought
out
the
gracious
reposeful
lines
of
a
body
that
ripened
in
adolescence
and
though
there
was
a
vibration
of
resolution
in
her
voice
she
spoke
like
one
who
is
under
her
own
control
mother
has
told
you
that
i
have
disgraced
myself
she
began
no
said
the
bishop
weighing
it
no
but
you
seem
to
have
been
indiscreet
little
i
got
excited
she
said
they
began
turning
out
the
other
women
roughly
i
was
you
did
go
to
interrupt
he
asked
she
considered
no
she
said
but
i
he
liked
her
disposition
to
get
it
right
on
that
side
he
assisted
it
is
the
same
thing
as
really
meaning
daddy
she
said
and
then
things
happened
yes
she
said
to
the
fire
a
pause
followed
if
they
had
been
in
a
her
barrister
would
have
said
that
is
my
case
my
the
bishop
prepared
to
open
the
next
stage
in
the
proceedings
i
think
norah
you
should
have
been
there
at
all
he
said
mother
says
a
man
in
my
position
is
apt
to
be
judged
by
his
family
you
commit
more
than
yourself
when
you
commit
an
indiscretion
apart
from
that
it
was
the
place
for
a
girl
to
be
at
you
are
not
a
child
now
we
give
you
freedom
more
freedom
than
most
girls
get
because
we
think
you
will
use
it
wisely
you
knew
enough
to
know
that
there
was
likely
to
be
the
girl
looked
into
the
fire
and
spoke
very
carefully
i
do
think
that
i
ought
to
know
the
things
that
are
going
the
bishop
studied
her
face
for
an
instant
it
struck
him
that
they
had
reached
something
very
fundamental
as
between
parent
and
child
his
modernity
showed
itself
in
the
temperance
of
his
reply
do
you
think
my
dear
that
on
the
whole
your
mother
and
i
who
have
lived
longer
and
know
more
are
more
likely
to
know
when
it
is
best
that
you
should
begin
to
know
this
or
that
the
girl
knitted
her
brows
and
seemed
to
be
reading
her
answer
out
of
the
depths
of
the
coals
she
was
on
the
verge
of
speaking
altered
her
mind
and
tried
a
different
beginning
i
think
that
every
one
must
do
their
thinking
his
thinking
for
oneself
she
said
awkwardly
you
mean
you
ca
trust
it
is
trusting
but
one
knows
best
for
oneself
when
one
is
and
you
find
yourself
hungry
i
want
to
find
out
for
myself
what
all
this
trouble
about
votes
and
things
and
we
starve
you
intellectually
you
know
i
do
think
that
but
you
are
busy
are
you
being
perhaps
a
little
impatient
eleanor
after
all
you
are
barely
eighteen
we
have
given
you
all
sorts
of
her
silence
admitted
it
but
still
she
said
after
a
long
pause
there
are
other
girls
younger
than
i
am
in
these
things
they
talk
about
oh
all
sorts
of
things
freely
you
been
awfully
good
to
me
she
said
irrelevantly
and
of
course
this
meeting
was
all
pure
father
and
daughter
remained
silent
for
awhile
seeking
a
better
grip
what
exactly
do
you
want
eleanor
he
asked
she
looked
up
at
him
generally
she
asked
your
mother
has
the
impression
that
you
are
discontented
is
a
horrid
well
she
remained
still
for
a
time
she
felt
the
moment
had
come
to
make
her
demand
i
would
like
to
go
to
newnham
or
somerville
and
work
i
feel
so
horribly
ignorant
of
all
sorts
of
things
if
i
were
a
son
i
should
go
ye
es
said
the
bishop
and
reflected
he
had
gone
rather
far
in
the
direction
of
the
woman
suffrage
people
he
had
advocated
equality
of
standard
in
all
sorts
of
matters
and
the
memory
of
these
utterances
hampered
him
you
could
read
here
he
tried
if
i
were
a
son
you
would
say
his
reply
was
vague
but
in
this
home
he
said
we
have
a
certain
he
left
her
to
imply
her
differences
in
sensibility
and
response
from
the
hardier
male
her
hesitation
marked
the
full
gravity
of
her
reply
it
just
that
she
said
one
feels
she
considered
it
further
as
if
we
were
living
in
a
kind
of
magic
world
not
really
real
out
there
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
the
drawn
blind
that
hid
the
night
one
meets
with
different
sorts
of
minds
and
different
atmospheres
all
this
is
very
beautiful
i
had
the
most
wonderful
home
but
there
a
sort
of
feeling
as
though
it
could
really
go
on
as
though
all
these
strikes
and
doubts
and
questionings
she
stopped
short
at
questionings
for
the
thing
was
said
the
bishop
took
her
meaning
gallantly
and
honestly
the
church
of
christ
little
norah
is
built
upon
a
she
made
no
answer
she
moved
her
head
very
slightly
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
and
remained
sitting
rather
stiffly
and
awkwardly
with
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
her
silence
was
the
third
and
greatest
blow
the
bishop
received
that
day
it
seemed
very
long
indeed
before
either
of
them
spoke
at
last
he
said
we
must
talk
about
these
things
again
norah
when
we
are
less
tired
and
have
more
time
you
have
been
reading
books
when
caxton
set
up
his
he
thrust
a
new
power
between
church
and
disciple
and
father
and
child
and
i
am
tired
we
must
talk
it
over
a
little
the
girl
stood
up
she
took
her
father
hands
dear
dear
daddy
she
said
i
am
so
sorry
to
be
a
bother
i
am
so
sorry
i
went
to
that
meeting
you
look
tired
we
must
talk
properly
said
the
bishop
patting
one
hand
then
discovering
from
her
wincing
face
that
it
was
the
sprained
one
your
poor
wrist
he
said
it
so
hard
to
talk
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
daddy
it
is
that
i
have
hidden
things
she
kissed
him
and
the
bishop
had
the
odd
fancy
that
she
kissed
him
as
though
she
was
sorry
for
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
really
there
could
be
no
time
like
the
present
for
discussing
these
questionings
of
hers
and
then
his
fatigue
and
shyness
had
the
better
of
him
again
the
papers
got
hold
of
eleanor
share
in
the
suffragette
disturbance
the
white
blackbird
said
things
about
her
it
did
not
attack
her
it
did
worse
it
admired
her
impudently
it
spoke
of
her
once
as
norah
and
once
as
the
scrope
its
headline
proclaimed
plucky
flappers
hold
up
chapter
the
third
insomnia
the
night
after
his
conversation
with
eleanor
was
the
first
night
of
the
bishop
insomnia
it
was
the
definite
beginning
of
a
new
phase
in
his
life
doctors
explain
to
us
that
the
immediate
cause
of
insomnia
is
always
some
poisoned
or
depleted
state
of
the
body
and
no
doubt
the
fatigues
and
hasty
meals
of
the
day
had
left
the
bishop
in
a
state
of
unprecedented
chemical
disorder
with
his
nerves
irritated
by
strange
compounds
and
unsoothed
by
familiar
lubricants
but
chemical
disorders
follow
mental
disturbances
and
the
core
and
essence
of
his
trouble
was
an
intellectual
distress
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
really
in
doubt
about
himself
about
his
way
of
living
about
all
his
persuasions
it
was
a
general
doubt
it
was
not
a
specific
suspicion
upon
this
point
or
that
it
was
a
feeling
of
detachment
and
unreality
at
once
extraordinarily
vague
and
extraordinarily
oppressive
it
was
as
if
he
discovered
himself
flimsy
and
transparent
in
a
world
of
minatory
solidity
and
opacity
it
was
as
if
he
found
himself
made
not
of
flesh
and
blood
but
of
tissue
paper
but
this
intellectual
insecurity
extended
into
his
physical
sensations
it
affected
his
feeling
in
his
skin
as
if
it
were
not
absolutely
his
own
skin
and
as
he
lay
there
a
weak
phantom
mentally
and
bodily
an
endless
succession
and
recurrence
of
anxieties
for
which
he
could
find
no
reassurance
besieged
him
chief
of
this
was
his
distress
for
eleanor
she
was
the
central
figure
in
this
new
sense
of
illusion
in
familiar
and
trusted
things
it
was
not
only
that
the
world
of
his
existence
which
had
seemed
to
be
the
whole
universe
had
become
diaphanous
and
betrayed
vast
and
uncontrollable
realities
beyond
it
but
his
daughter
had
as
it
were
suddenly
opened
a
door
in
this
glassy
sphere
of
insecurity
that
had
been
his
abiding
refuge
a
door
upon
the
stormy
rebel
outer
world
and
she
stood
there
young
ignorant
confident
adventurous
ready
to
step
out
could
it
be
possible
that
she
did
not
believe
he
saw
her
very
vividly
as
he
had
seen
her
in
the
slender
and
upright
half
child
half
woman
so
fragile
and
so
fearless
and
the
door
she
opened
thus
carelessly
gave
upon
a
stormy
background
like
one
of
the
stormy
backgrounds
that
were
popular
behind
portrait
dianas
in
eighteenth
century
paintings
did
she
believe
that
all
he
had
taught
her
all
the
life
he
led
was
what
was
her
phrase
a
kind
of
magic
world
not
really
real
he
groaned
and
turned
over
and
repeated
the
words
a
kind
of
magic
world
not
really
real
the
wind
blew
through
the
door
she
opened
and
scattered
everything
in
the
room
and
still
she
held
the
door
open
he
was
astonished
at
himself
he
started
up
in
swift
indignation
had
he
not
taught
the
child
had
he
not
brought
her
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
faith
what
right
had
she
to
turn
upon
him
in
this
matter
it
was
indeed
it
was
a
sort
of
insolence
a
lack
of
reverence
it
was
strange
he
had
not
perceived
this
at
the
time
but
indeed
at
the
first
mention
of
questionings
he
ought
to
have
thundered
he
saw
that
quite
clearly
now
he
ought
to
have
cried
out
and
said
on
your
knees
my
norah
and
ask
pardon
of
god
because
after
all
faith
is
an
emotional
thing
he
began
to
think
very
rapidly
and
copiously
of
things
he
ought
to
have
said
to
eleanor
and
now
the
eloquence
of
reverie
was
upon
him
in
a
little
time
he
was
also
addressing
the
at
morrice
deans
upon
them
too
he
ought
to
have
thundered
and
he
knew
now
also
all
that
he
should
have
said
to
the
recalcitrant
employer
thunder
also
thunder
is
surely
the
privilege
of
the
higher
clergy
under
jove
but
why
had
he
thundered
he
gesticulated
in
the
darkness
thrust
out
a
clutching
hand
there
are
situations
that
must
be
gripped
gripped
firmly
and
without
delay
in
the
middle
ages
there
had
been
grip
enough
in
a
purple
glove
from
these
belated
seizures
of
the
day
lost
opportunities
the
bishop
passed
to
such
a
pessimistic
estimate
of
the
church
as
had
never
entered
his
mind
before
it
was
as
if
he
had
fallen
suddenly
out
of
a
spiritual
balloon
into
a
world
of
bleak
realism
he
found
himself
asking
unprecedented
and
devastating
questions
questions
that
implied
the
most
fundamental
shiftings
of
opinion
why
was
the
church
such
a
failure
why
had
it
no
grip
upon
either
masters
or
men
amidst
this
vigorous
life
of
modern
industrialism
and
why
had
it
no
grip
upon
the
questioning
young
it
was
a
tolerated
thing
he
felt
just
as
sometimes
he
had
felt
that
the
crown
was
a
tolerated
thing
he
too
was
a
tolerated
thing
a
curious
survival
this
was
not
as
things
should
be
he
struggled
to
recover
a
proper
attitude
but
he
remained
enormously
dissatisfied
the
church
was
no
levite
to
pass
by
on
the
other
side
away
from
the
struggles
and
wrongs
of
the
social
conflict
it
had
no
right
when
the
children
asked
for
the
bread
of
life
to
offer
them
gothic
stone
he
began
to
make
interminable
weak
plans
for
fulfilling
his
duty
to
his
diocese
and
his
daughter
what
could
he
do
to
revivify
his
clergy
he
wished
he
had
more
personal
magnetism
he
wished
he
had
a
darker
and
a
larger
presence
he
wished
he
had
not
been
saddled
with
whippham
rather
futile
son
as
his
chaplain
he
wished
he
had
a
dean
instead
of
being
his
own
dean
with
an
unsympathetic
rector
he
wished
he
had
it
in
him
to
make
some
resounding
appeal
he
might
of
course
preach
a
series
of
thumping
addresses
and
sermons
rather
on
the
lines
of
fors
clavigera
to
masters
and
men
in
the
cathedral
only
it
was
so
difficult
to
get
either
masters
or
men
into
the
cathedral
well
if
the
people
will
not
come
to
the
bishop
the
bishop
must
go
out
to
the
people
should
he
go
outside
the
cathedral
to
the
place
where
the
trains
met
interweaving
with
such
thoughts
the
problem
of
eleanor
rose
again
into
his
consciousness
were
there
books
she
ought
to
read
were
there
books
she
ought
to
be
made
to
read
and
books
and
friends
that
ought
to
be
imperatively
forbidden
imperatively
but
how
to
define
the
forbidden
he
began
to
compose
an
address
on
modern
literature
it
became
acrimonious
before
dawn
the
birds
began
to
sing
his
mind
had
seemed
to
be
a
little
tranquillized
there
had
been
a
distinct
feeling
of
subsidence
sleepwards
when
first
one
and
then
another
little
creature
roused
itself
and
the
bishop
to
greet
the
gathering
daylight
it
became
a
little
clamour
a
misty
sea
of
sound
in
which
individuality
appeared
and
disappeared
for
a
time
a
distant
cuckoo
was
very
perceptible
like
a
landmark
looming
up
over
a
fog
like
the
cuckoo
in
the
pastoral
symphony
the
bishop
tried
not
to
heed
these
sounds
but
they
were
by
their
very
nature
insistent
sounds
he
lay
disregarding
them
acutely
presently
he
pulled
the
coverlet
over
his
ears
a
little
later
he
sat
up
in
bed
again
in
a
slight
detail
he
marked
his
strange
and
novel
detachment
from
the
world
of
his
upbringing
his
hallucination
of
disillusionment
had
spread
from
himself
and
his
church
and
his
faith
to
the
whole
animate
creation
he
knew
that
these
were
the
voices
of
our
feathered
songsters
that
this
was
a
joyous
chorus
greeting
the
day
he
knew
that
a
wakeful
bishop
ought
to
bless
these
happy
creatures
and
join
with
them
by
reciting
ken
morning
hymn
he
made
an
effort
that
was
more
than
half
habit
to
repeat
and
he
repeated
with
a
scowling
face
and
the
voice
of
a
schoolmaster
awake
my
soul
and
with
the
sun
thy
daily
stage
of
duty
run
he
got
no
further
he
stopped
short
sat
still
thinking
what
utterly
detestable
things
singing
birds
were
blackbird
had
gripped
his
attention
never
had
he
heard
such
vain
repetitions
he
struggled
against
the
dark
mood
of
criticism
he
prayeth
best
who
loveth
best
no
he
did
not
love
the
birds
it
was
useless
to
pretend
whatever
one
may
say
about
other
birds
a
cuckoo
is
a
low
detestable
cad
of
a
bird
then
the
bishop
began
to
be
particularly
tormented
by
a
bird
that
made
a
short
insistent
wheezing
sound
at
regular
intervals
of
perhaps
twenty
seconds
if
a
bird
could
have
that
he
thought
was
the
sort
of
whoop
it
would
have
but
even
if
it
had
he
could
not
pity
it
he
hung
in
its
intervals
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
wheeze
and
then
that
blackbird
reasserted
itself
it
had
a
rich
boastful
note
it
seemed
proud
of
its
noisy
reiteration
of
simple
for
some
obscure
reason
the
phrase
oleographic
sounds
drifted
into
the
bishop
thoughts
this
bird
produced
the
peculiar
and
irrational
impression
that
it
had
recently
made
a
considerable
sum
of
money
by
shrewd
industrialism
it
was
he
thought
grimly
a
genuine
princhester
blackbird
this
wickedly
uncharitable
reference
to
his
diocese
ran
all
unchallenged
through
the
bishop
mind
and
others
no
less
wicked
followed
it
once
during
his
summer
holidays
in
florence
he
and
lady
ella
had
subscribed
to
an
association
for
the
protection
of
he
recalled
this
now
with
a
mild
wonder
it
seemed
to
him
that
perhaps
after
all
it
was
as
well
to
let
and
italians
deal
with
in
their
own
way
perhaps
after
all
they
had
a
wisdom
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
face
the
world
after
all
is
not
made
entirely
for
there
is
such
a
thing
as
proportion
may
become
a
luxury
an
indulgence
an
excess
did
the
birds
eat
the
fruit
in
paradise
perhaps
there
they
worked
for
some
collective
musical
effect
had
some
sort
of
conductor
in
the
place
of
this
hullabaloo
he
decided
to
walk
about
the
room
for
a
time
and
then
remake
his
bed
the
sunrise
found
the
bishop
with
his
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
window
trying
to
see
that
blackbird
he
just
wanted
to
look
at
it
he
was
persuaded
it
was
a
quite
exceptional
blackbird
again
came
that
oppressive
sense
of
the
futility
of
the
contemporary
church
but
this
time
it
came
in
the
most
grotesque
form
for
hanging
half
out
of
the
casement
he
was
suddenly
reminded
of
francis
of
assisi
and
how
at
his
rebuke
the
wheeling
swallow
stilled
their
cries
but
it
was
all
so
different
then
it
was
only
after
he
had
passed
four
similar
nights
with
intervening
days
of
lassitude
and
afternoon
siestas
that
the
bishop
realized
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
insomnia
he
did
not
go
at
once
to
a
doctor
but
he
told
his
trouble
to
every
one
he
met
and
received
much
tentative
advice
he
had
meant
to
have
his
talk
with
eleanor
on
the
morning
next
after
their
conversation
in
the
but
his
bodily
and
spiritual
anaemia
prevented
him
the
fifth
night
was
the
beginning
of
the
whitsuntide
ember
week
and
he
wore
a
red
cassock
and
had
a
distracting
and
rather
interesting
day
welcoming
his
ordination
candidates
they
had
a
good
effect
upon
him
we
spiritualize
ourselves
when
we
seek
to
spiritualize
others
and
he
went
to
bed
in
a
happier
frame
of
mind
than
he
had
done
since
the
day
of
the
shock
he
woke
in
the
night
but
he
woke
much
more
himself
than
he
had
been
since
the
trouble
began
he
repeated
that
verse
of
ken
when
in
the
night
i
sleepless
lie
my
soul
with
heavenly
thoughts
supply
let
no
ill
dreams
disturb
my
rest
no
powers
of
darkness
me
almost
immediately
after
these
there
floated
into
his
mind
as
if
it
were
a
message
the
dear
familiar
words
he
giveth
his
beloved
these
words
irradiated
and
soothed
him
quite
miraculously
the
clouds
of
doubt
seemed
to
dissolve
and
vanish
and
leave
him
safe
and
calm
under
a
clear
sky
he
knew
those
words
were
a
promise
and
very
speedily
he
fell
asleep
and
slept
until
he
was
called
but
the
next
day
was
a
troubled
one
whippham
had
muddled
his
timetable
and
crowded
his
afternoon
the
strike
of
the
transport
workers
had
begun
and
the
ugly
noises
they
made
at
the
tramway
depot
where
they
were
booing
some
one
penetrated
into
the
palace
he
had
to
snatch
a
meal
between
services
and
the
sense
of
hurry
invaded
his
afternoon
lectures
to
the
candidates
he
hated
hurry
in
ember
week
his
ideal
was
one
of
quiet
serenity
of
grave
things
said
slowly
of
still
kneeling
figures
of
a
sort
of
dark
cool
spiritual
germination
but
what
sort
of
dark
cool
spiritual
germination
is
possible
with
an
ass
like
whippham
about
in
the
fresh
courage
of
the
morning
the
bishop
had
arranged
for
that
talk
with
eleanor
he
had
already
deferred
too
long
and
this
had
proved
less
satisfactory
than
he
had
intended
it
to
be
the
bishop
experience
with
the
ordination
candidates
was
following
the
usual
course
before
they
came
there
was
something
bordering
upon
distaste
for
the
coming
invasion
then
always
there
was
an
effect
of
surprise
at
the
youth
and
faith
of
the
neophytes
and
a
real
response
of
the
spirit
to
the
occasion
throughout
the
first
hours
they
were
all
simply
neophytes
without
individuality
to
break
up
their
uniformity
of
then
afterwards
they
began
to
develop
little
personal
traits
and
scarcely
ever
were
these
pleasing
traits
always
one
or
two
of
them
would
begin
haunting
the
bishop
giving
way
to
an
appetite
for
special
words
special
recognitions
he
knew
the
expression
of
that
craving
on
their
faces
he
knew
the
movements
in
room
and
passage
that
presently
began
this
time
in
particular
there
was
a
freckled
underbred
young
man
who
handed
in
what
was
evidently
a
carefully
prepared
memorandum
upon
what
he
called
my
apparently
he
had
a
muddle
of
doubts
about
the
early
fathers
and
the
dates
of
the
earlier
authentic
copies
of
the
gospels
things
of
no
conceivable
significance
the
bishop
glanced
through
this
bale
of
papers
it
had
of
course
no
index
and
no
synopsis
and
some
of
the
pages
were
not
numbered
handed
it
over
to
whippham
and
when
he
proved
as
usual
a
broken
reed
the
bishop
had
the
brilliant
idea
of
referring
the
young
man
to
canon
bliss
of
pringle
who
has
a
special
knowledge
quite
beyond
my
own
in
this
but
he
knew
from
the
young
man
eye
even
as
he
said
this
that
it
was
not
going
to
put
him
off
for
more
than
a
day
or
so
the
immediate
result
of
glancing
over
these
papers
was
however
to
enhance
in
the
bishop
mind
a
growing
disposition
to
minimize
the
importance
of
all
dated
and
explicit
evidences
and
arguments
for
orthodox
beliefs
and
to
resort
to
vague
symbolic
and
liberal
interpretations
and
it
was
in
this
state
that
he
came
to
his
talk
with
eleanor
he
did
not
give
her
much
time
to
develop
her
objections
he
met
her
half
way
and
stated
them
for
her
and
overwhelmed
her
with
sympathy
and
understanding
she
had
been
too
too
literal
was
his
keynote
he
was
a
little
astonished
at
the
liberality
of
his
own
views
he
had
been
getting
along
now
for
some
years
without
looking
into
his
own
opinions
too
closely
and
he
was
by
no
means
prepared
to
discover
how
far
he
had
come
to
meet
his
daughter
scepticisms
but
he
did
meet
them
he
met
them
so
thoroughly
that
he
almost
conveyed
that
hers
was
a
needlessly
conservative
and
oldfashioned
attitude
occasionally
he
felt
he
was
being
a
little
evasive
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
as
she
took
his
drift
her
relief
and
happiness
were
manifest
and
he
had
never
noticed
before
how
clear
and
pretty
her
eyes
were
they
were
the
most
honest
eyes
he
had
ever
seen
she
looked
at
him
very
steadily
as
he
explained
and
lit
up
at
his
points
she
brightened
wonderfully
as
she
realized
that
after
all
they
were
not
apart
they
had
not
differed
simply
they
had
misunderstood
and
before
he
knew
where
he
was
and
in
a
mere
parenthetical
declaration
of
liberality
he
surprised
himself
by
conceding
her
demand
for
newnham
even
before
she
had
repeated
it
it
helped
his
case
wonderfully
call
in
every
exterior
witness
you
can
the
church
will
welcome
them
no
i
want
you
to
go
my
dear
but
his
mind
was
stirred
again
to
its
depths
by
this
discussion
and
in
particular
he
was
surprised
and
a
little
puzzled
by
this
newnham
concession
and
the
necessity
of
making
his
new
attitude
clear
to
lady
ella
it
was
with
a
sense
of
fatality
that
he
found
himself
awake
again
that
night
like
some
one
lying
drowned
and
still
and
yet
perfectly
conscious
at
the
bottom
of
deep
cold
water
he
repeated
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
but
all
the
conviction
had
gone
out
of
the
words
neither
the
bishop
insomnia
nor
his
incertitudes
about
himself
and
his
faith
developed
in
a
simple
and
orderly
manner
there
were
periods
of
sustained
suffering
and
periods
of
recovery
it
was
not
for
a
year
or
so
that
he
regarded
these
troubles
as
more
than
acute
incidental
interruptions
of
his
general
tranquillity
or
realized
that
he
was
passing
into
a
new
phase
of
life
and
into
a
new
quality
of
thought
he
told
every
one
of
the
insomnia
and
no
one
of
his
doubts
these
he
betrayed
only
by
an
increasing
tendency
towards
vagueness
symbolism
poetry
and
toleration
eleanor
seemed
satisfied
with
his
exposition
she
did
not
press
for
further
enlightenment
she
continued
all
her
outward
conformities
except
that
after
a
time
she
ceased
to
communicate
and
in
september
she
went
away
to
newnham
her
doubts
had
not
visibly
affected
clementina
or
her
other
sisters
and
the
bishop
made
no
further
attempts
to
explore
the
spiritual
life
of
his
family
below
the
surface
of
its
formal
acquiescence
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
own
spiritual
wrestlings
were
almost
exclusively
nocturnal
during
his
spells
of
insomnia
he
led
a
curiously
double
existence
in
the
daytime
he
was
largely
the
self
he
had
always
been
able
assured
ecclesiastical
except
that
he
was
a
little
jaded
and
irritable
or
sleepy
instead
of
being
quick
and
bright
he
believed
in
god
and
the
church
and
the
royal
family
and
himself
securely
in
the
wakeful
night
time
he
experienced
a
different
and
novel
self
a
self
bleakly
fearless
at
its
best
shamelessly
weak
at
its
worst
critical
sceptical
joyless
anxious
the
anxiety
was
quite
the
worst
element
of
all
something
sat
by
his
pillow
asking
grey
questions
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
going
is
it
really
well
with
the
children
is
it
really
well
with
the
church
is
it
really
well
with
the
country
are
you
indeed
doing
anything
at
all
are
you
anything
more
than
an
actor
wearing
a
costume
in
an
archaic
play
the
people
turn
their
backs
on
he
would
twist
over
on
his
pillow
he
would
whisper
hymns
and
prayers
that
had
the
quality
of
charms
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
that
answered
many
times
and
many
times
it
failed
the
labour
troubles
of
eased
off
as
the
year
wore
on
and
the
bitterness
of
the
local
press
over
the
palace
abated
very
considerably
indeed
there
was
something
like
a
watery
gleam
of
popularity
when
he
brought
down
his
consistent
friend
the
dear
old
princess
christiana
of
hoch
and
unter
black
bonnet
deafness
and
all
to
open
a
new
wing
of
the
children
hospital
the
princhester
conservative
paper
took
the
occasion
to
inform
the
diocese
that
he
was
a
fluent
german
scholar
and
consequently
a
persona
grata
with
the
royal
aunts
and
that
the
princess
christiana
was
merely
just
one
of
a
number
of
royalties
now
practically
at
the
beck
and
call
of
princhester
it
was
not
true
but
it
was
very
effective
locally
and
seemed
to
justify
a
little
the
hauteur
of
which
lady
ella
was
so
unjustly
suspected
yet
it
involved
a
possibility
of
disappointments
in
the
future
he
went
to
too
upon
the
score
of
his
general
health
and
revised
his
general
regimen
discouraged
indiscreet
fasting
and
suggested
a
complete
abstinence
from
red
wine
except
white
port
if
indeed
that
can
be
called
a
red
wine
and
a
moderate
use
of
egyptian
cigarettes
but
was
a
strenuous
year
the
labour
troubles
revived
the
suffragette
movement
increased
greatly
in
violence
and
aggressiveness
and
there
sprang
up
no
less
than
three
ecclesiastical
scandals
in
the
diocese
first
the
kensitites
set
themselves
firmly
to
make
presentations
and
prosecutions
against
morrice
deans
who
was
reserving
the
sacrament
wearing
they
said
babylonish
garments
going
beyond
all
reason
in
the
matter
of
infant
confession
and
generally
brightening
up
mogham
banks
next
a
popular
preacher
in
wombash
published
a
book
under
the
exasperating
title
the
light
under
the
altar
in
which
he
showed
himself
as
something
between
an
arian
and
a
pantheist
and
treated
the
dogma
of
the
trinity
with
as
little
respect
as
one
would
show
to
an
intrusive
cat
while
thirdly
an
obscure
but
overworked
missioner
of
a
tin
mission
church
in
the
new
district
at
pringle
being
discovered
in
some
sort
of
polygamous
relationship
had
seen
fit
to
publish
in
pamphlet
form
a
scandalous
admission
and
defence
a
pamphlet
entitled
marriage
true
and
false
taking
the
public
needlessly
into
his
completest
confidence
and
quoting
the
affairs
of
abraham
and
hosea
reviving
many
points
that
are
better
forgotten
about
luther
and
appealing
also
to
such
uncanonical
authorities
as
milton
plato
and
john
humphrey
noyes
this
abnormal
concurrence
of
indiscipline
was
extremely
unlucky
for
the
bishop
it
plunged
him
into
strenuous
controversy
upon
three
fronts
so
to
speak
and
involved
a
great
number
of
personal
encounters
far
too
vivid
for
his
mental
serenity
the
pringle
polygamist
was
the
most
moving
as
morrice
deans
was
the
most
exacting
and
troublesome
and
the
wombash
pantheist
the
most
insidiously
destructive
figure
in
these
three
toilsome
disputes
the
pringle
soul
had
apparently
missed
the
normal
distribution
of
he
was
an
illiterate
freckled
creature
with
large
expository
hands
who
had
come
by
a
side
way
into
the
church
because
he
was
an
indefatigable
worker
and
he
insisted
upon
telling
the
bishop
with
an
irrepressible
candour
and
completeness
just
exactly
what
was
the
matter
with
his
intimate
life
the
bishop
very
earnestly
did
not
want
these
details
and
did
his
utmost
to
avoid
the
controversial
questions
that
the
honest
man
pressed
respectfully
but
obstinately
upon
him
even
paul
my
lord
admitted
that
it
is
better
to
marry
than
burn
said
the
pringle
misdemeanant
and
here
was
i
my
lord
married
and
still
burning
and
i
think
you
would
find
my
lord
considering
all
charlotte
peculiarities
that
the
situation
was
really
much
more
trying
than
the
absolute
celibacy
paul
had
in
the
bishop
listened
to
these
arguments
as
little
as
possible
and
did
not
answer
them
at
all
but
afterwards
the
offender
came
and
wept
and
said
he
was
ruined
and
heartbroken
and
unfairly
treated
because
he
was
a
gentleman
and
that
was
distressing
it
was
so
exactly
true
and
so
inevitable
he
had
been
deprived
rather
on
account
of
his
voice
and
apologetics
than
of
his
offence
and
public
opinion
was
solidly
with
the
sentence
he
made
a
gallant
effort
to
found
what
he
called
a
labour
church
in
pringle
and
after
some
financial
misunderstandings
departed
with
his
unambiguous
menage
to
join
the
advanced
movement
on
the
clyde
the
morrice
deans
enquiry
however
demanded
an
amount
of
erudition
that
greatly
fatigued
the
bishop
he
had
a
very
fair
general
knowledge
of
vestments
but
he
had
never
really
cared
for
anything
but
the
poetry
of
ornaments
and
he
had
to
work
strenuously
to
master
the
legal
side
of
the
question
whippham
his
chaplain
was
worse
than
useless
as
a
helper
the
bishop
wanted
to
end
the
matter
as
quickly
quietly
and
favourably
to
morrice
deans
as
possible
he
thought
morrice
deans
a
thoroughly
good
man
in
his
parish
and
he
believed
that
the
substitution
of
a
low
churchman
would
mean
a
very
complete
collapse
of
church
influence
in
mogham
banks
where
people
were
now
thoroughly
accustomed
to
a
highly
ornate
service
but
morrice
deans
was
intractable
and
his
pursuers
indefatigable
and
on
several
occasions
the
bishop
sat
far
into
the
night
devising
compromises
and
equivocations
that
should
make
the
kensitites
think
that
morrice
deans
was
wearing
vestments
when
he
was
and
that
should
make
morrice
deans
think
he
was
wearing
vestments
when
he
was
and
it
was
whippham
who
first
suggested
green
tea
as
a
substitute
for
coffee
which
gave
the
bishop
indigestion
as
his
stimulant
for
these
nocturnal
bouts
now
green
tea
is
the
most
lucid
of
poisons
and
while
all
this
extra
activity
about
morrice
deans
these
vigils
and
crammings
and
writings
down
were
using
all
and
more
energy
than
the
bishop
could
well
spare
he
was
also
doing
his
quiet
utmost
to
keep
the
light
under
the
altar
ease
from
coming
to
a
head
this
man
he
hated
and
he
dreaded
him
as
well
as
hated
him
chasters
the
author
of
the
light
under
the
altar
was
a
man
who
not
only
reasoned
closely
but
indelicately
there
was
a
demonstrating
jeering
air
about
his
preaching
and
writing
and
everything
he
said
and
did
was
saturated
by
the
spirit
of
challenge
he
did
not
so
much
imitate
as
exaggerate
the
style
of
matthew
arnold
and
whatever
was
done
publicly
against
him
would
have
to
be
done
very
publicly
because
his
book
had
got
him
a
london
reputation
from
the
bishop
point
of
view
chasters
was
one
of
nature
ignoblemen
he
seemed
to
have
subscribed
to
the
articles
and
passed
all
the
tests
and
taken
all
the
pledges
that
stand
on
the
way
to
ordination
chiefly
for
the
pleasure
of
attacking
them
more
successfully
from
the
rear
he
had
been
given
the
living
of
wombash
by
a
cousin
and
filled
it
very
largely
because
it
was
not
only
more
piquant
but
more
remunerative
and
respectable
to
be
a
rationalist
lecturer
in
a
surplice
and
in
a
hard
kind
of
way
his
social
and
parochial
work
was
not
badly
done
but
his
sermons
were
terrible
he
takes
a
text
said
one
informant
and
he
goes
on
firstly
secondly
thirdly
fourthly
like
somebody
tearing
the
petals
from
a
flower
he
says
and
throws
the
bare
stalk
into
the
the
bishop
avoided
the
light
under
the
altar
for
nearly
a
year
it
was
only
when
a
second
book
was
announced
with
the
winning
title
of
the
core
of
truth
in
christianity
that
he
perceived
he
must
take
action
he
sat
up
late
one
night
with
a
marked
copy
a
very
indignantly
marked
copy
of
the
former
work
that
an
elderly
colonel
a
wombash
parishioner
an
orthodox
layman
of
the
most
virulent
type
had
sent
him
he
perceived
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
dialectician
of
exceptional
ability
who
had
concentrated
a
quite
considerable
weight
of
scholarship
upon
the
task
of
explaining
away
every
scrap
of
spiritual
significance
in
the
eucharist
from
chasters
the
bishop
was
driven
by
reference
to
the
works
of
legge
and
frazer
and
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
measure
the
dimensions
and
power
of
the
modern
criticism
of
church
doctrine
and
observance
green
tea
should
have
lit
his
way
to
refutation
instead
it
lit
up
the
whole
inquiry
with
a
light
of
melancholy
confirmation
neither
by
night
nor
by
day
could
the
bishop
find
a
proper
method
of
opening
a
counter
attack
upon
chasters
who
was
indisputably
an
intellectually
abler
man
and
a
very
ruthless
beast
indeed
to
assail
and
meanwhile
the
demand
that
action
should
be
taken
increased
the
literature
of
church
history
and
the
controversies
arising
out
of
doctrinal
development
became
the
employment
of
the
bishop
leisure
and
a
commanding
preoccupation
he
would
have
liked
to
discuss
with
some
one
else
the
network
of
perplexities
in
which
he
was
entangling
himself
and
more
particularly
with
canon
bliss
but
his
own
positions
were
becoming
so
insecure
that
he
feared
to
betray
them
by
argument
he
had
grown
up
with
a
kind
of
intellectual
modesty
some
things
he
had
never
yet
talked
about
it
made
his
mind
blench
to
think
of
talking
about
them
and
his
great
aching
gaps
of
wakefulness
began
now
thanks
to
the
green
tea
to
be
interspersed
with
theological
dreams
and
visions
of
an
extravagant
vividness
he
would
see
frazer
sacrificial
kings
butchered
picturesquely
and
terribly
amidst
strange
and
grotesque
rituals
he
would
survey
long
and
elaborate
processions
and
ceremonials
in
which
the
most
remarkable
symbols
were
borne
high
in
the
sight
of
all
men
he
would
cower
before
a
gigantic
and
threatening
heaven
these
dreams
and
visions
were
not
so
much
phases
of
sleep
as
an
intensification
and
vivid
furnishing
forth
of
insomnia
it
added
greatly
to
his
disturbance
that
exceeding
the
instructions
of
he
had
now
experimented
ignorantly
and
planlessly
with
one
or
two
narcotics
and
sleeping
mixtures
that
friends
and
acquaintances
had
mentioned
in
his
hearing
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
became
secretive
from
his
wife
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
take
these
things
he
knew
they
were
physically
and
morally
evil
but
a
tormenting
craving
drove
him
to
them
subtly
and
insensibly
his
character
was
being
undermined
by
the
growing
nervous
trouble
he
astonished
himself
by
the
cunning
and
the
hypocritical
dignity
he
could
display
in
procuring
these
drugs
he
arranged
to
have
a
set
in
his
bedroom
and
secretly
substituted
green
tea
for
which
he
developed
a
powerful
craving
in
the
place
of
the
delicate
china
tea
lady
ella
procured
him
these
doctrinal
and
physical
anxieties
and
distresses
were
at
their
worst
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
of
that
was
a
time
of
great
mental
and
moral
disturbance
there
was
premonition
in
the
air
of
those
days
it
was
like
the
uneasiness
sensitive
people
experience
before
a
thunderstorm
the
moral
atmosphere
was
sullen
and
close
the
whole
world
seemed
irritable
and
mischievous
the
suffragettes
became
extraordinarily
malignant
the
democratic
movement
went
rotten
with
sabotage
and
with
a
cant
of
being
rebels
the
reactionary
tories
and
a
crew
of
noisy
old
peeresses
set
themselves
to
create
incurable
confusion
again
in
the
healing
wounds
of
ireland
and
feuds
and
frantic
folly
broke
out
at
every
point
of
the
social
and
political
edifice
and
then
a
bomb
burst
at
sarajevo
that
silenced
all
this
tumult
the
unstable
polity
of
europe
heeled
over
like
a
ship
that
founders
through
the
swiftest
tensest
week
in
history
europe
capsized
into
war
the
first
effect
of
the
war
upon
the
mind
of
the
bishop
as
upon
most
imaginative
minds
was
to
steady
and
exalt
it
trivialities
and
exasperations
seemed
swept
out
of
existence
men
lifted
up
their
eyes
from
disputes
that
had
seemed
incurable
and
wrangling
that
promised
to
be
interminable
and
discovered
a
plain
and
tragic
issue
that
involved
every
one
in
a
common
call
for
devotion
for
a
great
number
of
men
and
women
who
had
been
born
and
bred
in
security
the
august
and
september
of
were
the
supremely
heroic
period
of
their
lives
myriads
of
souls
were
born
again
to
ideas
of
service
and
sacrifice
in
those
tremendous
days
black
and
evil
thing
as
the
war
was
it
was
at
any
rate
a
great
thing
it
did
this
much
for
countless
minds
that
for
the
first
time
they
realized
the
epic
quality
of
history
and
their
own
relationship
to
the
destinies
of
the
race
the
flimsy
roof
under
which
we
had
been
living
our
lives
of
comedy
fell
and
shattered
the
floor
under
our
feet
we
saw
the
stars
above
and
the
abyss
below
we
perceived
that
life
was
insecure
and
adventurous
part
of
one
vast
adventure
in
space
and
time
presently
the
smoke
and
dust
of
battle
hid
the
great
distances
again
but
they
could
not
altogether
destroy
the
memories
of
this
revelation
for
the
first
two
months
the
bishop
attention
was
so
detached
from
his
immediate
surroundings
and
employments
so
absorbed
by
great
events
that
his
history
if
it
were
told
in
detail
would
differ
scarcely
at
all
from
the
histories
of
most
comparatively
unemployed
minds
during
those
first
dramatic
days
the
days
when
the
germans
made
their
great
rush
upon
paris
and
it
seemed
that
france
was
down
france
and
the
whole
fabric
of
liberal
civilization
he
emerged
from
these
stunning
apprehensions
after
the
battle
of
the
marne
to
find
himself
busy
upon
a
score
of
dispersed
and
disconnected
war
jobs
and
trying
to
get
all
the
new
appearances
and
forces
and
urgencies
of
the
war
into
relations
with
himself
one
thing
became
very
vivid
indeed
that
he
was
being
used
in
any
real
and
effective
way
in
the
war
there
was
a
mighty
going
to
and
fro
upon
red
cross
work
and
various
war
committees
a
vast
preparation
for
wounded
men
and
for
the
succour
of
dislocated
families
a
preparation
that
proved
to
be
needless
for
catastrophic
unemployment
the
war
problem
and
the
puzzle
of
german
psychology
ousted
for
a
time
all
other
intellectual
interests
like
every
one
else
the
bishop
swam
deep
in
nietzsche
bernhardi
houston
stewart
chamberlain
and
the
like
he
preached
several
sermons
upon
german
materialism
and
the
astonishing
decay
of
the
german
character
he
also
read
every
newspaper
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
like
any
secular
man
he
signed
an
address
to
the
russian
orthodox
church
beginning
brethren
and
he
revised
his
impressions
of
the
filioque
controversy
the
idea
of
a
reunion
of
the
two
great
state
churches
of
russia
and
england
had
always
attracted
him
but
hitherto
it
had
been
a
thing
quite
out
of
scale
visionary
utopian
now
in
this
strange
time
of
altered
perspectives
it
seemed
the
most
practicable
of
suggestions
the
mayor
and
corporation
and
a
detachment
of
the
special
reserve
in
uniform
came
to
a
great
intercession
service
and
in
the
palace
there
were
two
conferences
of
local
influential
people
people
of
the
most
various
types
people
who
had
never
met
tolerantly
before
expressing
now
opinions
of
unprecedented
breadth
and
liberality
all
this
sort
of
thing
was
fresh
and
exciting
at
first
and
then
it
began
to
fall
into
a
routine
and
became
habitual
and
as
it
became
habitual
he
found
that
old
sense
of
detachment
and
futility
was
creeping
back
again
one
day
he
realized
that
indeed
the
whole
flood
and
tumult
of
the
war
would
be
going
on
almost
exactly
as
it
was
going
on
now
if
there
had
been
neither
cathedral
nor
bishop
in
princhester
it
came
to
him
that
if
archbishops
were
rolled
into
patriarchs
and
patriarchs
into
archbishops
it
would
matter
scarcely
more
in
the
world
process
that
was
afoot
than
if
two
men
shook
hands
while
their
house
was
afire
at
times
all
of
us
have
inappropriate
thoughts
the
unfortunate
thought
that
struck
the
bishop
as
a
bullet
might
strike
a
man
in
an
exposed
trench
as
he
was
hurrying
through
the
cloisters
to
a
special
service
and
address
upon
that
doubly
glorious
day
in
our
english
history
the
day
of
crispin
was
of
diogenes
rolling
his
tub
it
was
a
poisonous
thought
it
arose
perhaps
out
of
an
article
in
a
weekly
paper
at
which
he
had
glanced
after
lunch
an
article
written
by
one
of
those
sceptical
spirits
who
find
all
too
abundant
expression
in
our
periodical
literature
the
writer
boldly
charged
the
christian
churches
with
absolute
ineffectiveness
this
war
he
declared
was
above
all
other
wars
a
war
of
ideas
of
material
organization
against
rational
freedom
of
violence
against
law
it
was
a
war
more
copiously
discussed
than
any
war
had
ever
been
before
the
air
was
thick
with
apologetics
and
what
was
the
voice
of
the
church
amidst
these
elemental
issues
bishops
and
divines
who
were
patriots
one
heard
discordantly
enough
but
where
were
the
bishops
and
divines
who
spoke
for
the
prince
of
peace
where
was
the
blessing
of
the
church
where
was
the
veto
of
the
church
when
it
came
to
that
one
discovered
only
a
broad
preoccupied
back
busied
in
supplementing
the
army
medical
corps
with
red
cross
activities
good
work
in
its
way
except
that
the
canonicals
seemed
superfluous
who
indeed
looked
to
the
church
for
any
voice
at
all
and
so
to
diogenes
the
bishop
mind
went
hunting
for
an
answer
to
that
indictment
and
came
back
and
came
back
to
the
image
of
diogenes
it
was
with
that
image
dangling
like
a
barbed
arrow
from
his
mind
that
the
bishop
went
into
the
pulpit
to
preach
upon
crispin
day
and
looked
down
upon
a
thin
and
scattered
congregation
in
which
the
elderly
the
childless
and
the
unoccupied
predominated
that
night
insomnia
resumed
its
sway
of
course
the
church
ought
to
be
controlling
this
great
storm
the
greatest
storm
of
war
that
had
ever
stirred
mankind
it
ought
to
be
standing
fearlessly
between
the
combatants
like
a
figure
in
a
wall
painting
with
the
cross
of
christ
uplifted
and
the
restored
memory
of
christendom
softening
the
eyes
of
the
armed
nations
put
down
those
weapons
and
listen
to
me
so
the
church
should
speak
in
irresistible
tones
in
a
voice
of
silver
trumpets
instead
it
kept
a
long
way
from
the
fighting
tucked
up
its
vestments
and
was
rolling
its
local
tubs
quite
briskly
and
then
came
the
aggravation
of
all
these
distresses
by
an
abrupt
abandonment
of
smoking
and
alcohol
alcoholic
relaxation
a
necessary
mitigation
of
the
unreality
of
peacetime
politics
becomes
a
grave
danger
in
war
and
it
was
with
an
understandable
desire
to
forward
the
interests
of
his
realm
that
the
king
decided
to
set
his
statesmen
an
example
which
unhappily
was
not
very
widely
followed
by
abstaining
from
alcohol
during
the
continuance
of
the
struggle
it
did
however
swing
over
the
bishop
of
princhester
to
an
immediate
and
complete
abandonment
of
both
drink
and
tobacco
at
that
time
he
was
finding
comfort
for
his
nerves
in
manila
cheroots
and
a
particularly
big
and
heavy
type
of
egyptian
cigarette
with
a
considerable
amount
of
opium
and
his
disorganized
system
seized
upon
this
sudden
change
as
a
grievance
and
set
all
his
jangling
being
crying
aloud
for
one
cigarette
just
one
cigarette
the
cheroots
it
seemed
he
could
better
spare
but
a
cigarette
became
his
symbol
for
his
lost
steadiness
and
ease
it
brought
him
low
the
reader
has
already
been
told
the
lamentable
incident
of
the
stolen
cigarette
and
the
small
boy
and
how
the
bishop
tormented
by
that
shameful
memory
cried
aloud
in
the
night
the
bishop
rolled
his
tub
and
is
there
any
in
the
world
more
busy
and
exacting
than
a
bishop
he
rolled
in
it
spite
of
and
insomnia
and
all
the
while
he
was
tormented
by
the
enormous
background
of
the
world
war
by
his
ineffective
realization
of
vast
national
needs
by
his
passionate
desire
for
himself
and
his
church
not
to
be
ineffective
the
distressful
alternation
between
nights
of
lucid
doubt
and
days
of
dull
acquiescence
was
resumed
with
an
intensification
of
its
contrasts
the
brief
phase
of
hope
that
followed
the
turn
of
the
fighting
upon
the
maine
the
hope
that
after
all
the
war
would
end
swiftly
dramatically
and
justly
and
everything
be
as
it
had
been
before
but
pleasanter
gave
place
to
a
phase
that
bordered
upon
despair
the
fall
of
antwerp
and
the
doubts
and
uncertainties
of
the
flanders
situation
weighed
terribly
upon
the
bishop
he
was
haunted
for
a
time
by
nightmares
of
zeppelins
presently
raining
fire
upon
london
these
visions
became
apocalyptic
the
zeppelins
came
to
england
with
the
new
year
and
with
the
close
of
the
year
came
the
struggle
for
ypres
that
was
so
near
to
being
a
collapse
of
the
allied
defensive
the
events
of
the
early
spring
the
bloody
failure
of
british
generalship
at
neuve
chapelle
the
naval
disaster
in
the
dardanelles
the
sinking
of
the
falaba
the
russian
defeat
in
the
masurian
lakes
all
deepened
the
impression
of
the
immensity
of
the
nation
difficulties
and
of
his
own
unhelpfulness
he
was
ashamed
that
the
church
should
hold
back
its
curates
from
enlistment
while
the
french
priests
were
wearing
their
uniforms
in
the
trenches
the
expedition
of
the
bishop
of
london
to
hold
services
at
the
front
seemed
merely
to
accentuate
the
it
was
rolling
the
tub
just
where
it
was
most
in
the
way
what
was
wrong
what
was
wanting
the
westminster
gazette
the
spectator
and
several
other
of
the
most
trusted
organs
of
public
opinion
were
intermittently
discussing
the
same
question
their
discussions
implied
at
once
the
extreme
need
that
was
felt
for
religion
by
all
sorts
of
representative
people
and
the
universal
conviction
that
the
church
was
in
some
way
muddling
and
masking
her
revelation
what
is
wrong
with
the
churches
was
for
example
the
general
heading
of
the
westminster
correspondence
one
day
the
bishop
skimmed
a
brief
incisive
utterance
by
sir
harry
johnston
that
pierced
to
the
marrow
of
his
own
shrinking
convictions
sir
harry
is
one
of
those
people
who
seem
to
write
as
well
as
speak
in
a
quick
tenor
instead
of
propounding
plainly
and
without
the
acereted
mythology
of
asia
minor
greece
and
rome
the
pure
gospel
of
christ
they
present
it
overloaded
with
unbelievable
myths
such
as
among
a
thousand
others
that
massacre
of
the
innocents
which
never
took
place
bore
their
listeners
by
a
tibetan
repetition
of
creeds
that
have
ceased
to
be
credible
mutually
contradictory
propositions
prayers
and
litanies
composed
in
byzantine
and
mediaeval
times
the
want
of
actuality
the
curious
silliness
which
has
ever
since
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
hung
about
the
exposition
of
christianity
but
if
the
bishops
continue
to
fuss
about
the
trappings
of
religion
the
maintenance
of
codes
compiled
by
people
who
lived
sixteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
five
hundred
years
ago
the
increasingly
educated
and
working
classes
will
not
come
to
church
weekday
or
the
bishop
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
with
a
mind
that
he
felt
to
be
terribly
open
asked
himself
how
true
that
sharp
indictment
might
be
and
granting
its
general
truth
what
was
the
duty
of
the
church
that
is
to
say
of
the
bishops
for
as
cyprian
says
ecelesia
est
in
episcopo
we
say
the
creeds
how
far
may
we
unsay
them
so
far
he
had
taken
no
open
action
against
chasters
suppose
now
he
were
to
side
with
chasters
and
let
the
whole
diocese
the
church
of
princhester
drift
as
far
as
it
chose
under
his
inaction
towards
an
extreme
modernism
risking
a
conflict
with
and
if
necessary
fighting
the
archbishop
it
was
but
for
a
moment
that
his
mind
swung
to
this
possibility
and
then
recoiled
the
laymen
that
band
of
bigots
would
fight
he
could
not
contemplate
litigation
and
wrangling
about
the
teaching
of
the
church
besides
what
were
the
trappings
of
religion
and
what
the
essentials
what
after
all
was
the
pure
gospel
of
christ
of
which
this
writer
wrote
so
glibly
he
put
the
paper
down
and
took
a
new
testament
from
his
desk
and
opened
it
haphazard
he
felt
a
curious
wish
that
he
could
read
it
for
the
first
time
it
was
everything
latterly
in
his
theology
and
beliefs
had
become
it
had
all
become
mechanical
and
dead
and
unmeaning
to
his
tired
mind
whippham
came
with
a
reminder
of
more
and
the
speculations
were
broken
off
chapter
the
fourth
the
sympathy
of
lady
sunderbund
that
night
when
he
cried
aloud
at
the
memory
of
his
furtive
cigarette
the
bishop
was
staying
with
a
rich
man
named
garstein
fellows
these
garstein
fellows
people
were
steel
people
with
a
financial
side
to
them
young
garstein
fellows
had
his
fingers
in
various
chemical
businesses
and
the
real
life
of
the
firm
was
in
various
minor
partners
called
hartstein
and
blumenhart
and
so
forth
who
had
acquired
a
considerable
amount
of
ungentlemanly
science
and
energy
in
germany
and
german
switzerland
but
the
fellows
element
was
good
old
princhester
stuff
there
had
been
a
fellows
firm
in
princhester
in
they
were
not
people
the
bishop
liked
and
it
was
not
a
house
the
bishop
liked
staying
at
but
it
had
become
part
of
his
policy
to
visit
and
keep
in
touch
with
as
many
of
the
local
plutocracy
as
he
could
to
give
and
take
with
them
in
order
to
make
the
presence
of
the
church
a
reality
to
them
it
had
been
not
least
among
the
negligences
and
evasions
of
the
sainted
but
indolent
hood
that
he
had
invariably
refused
overnight
hospitality
whenever
it
was
possible
for
him
to
get
back
to
his
home
the
morning
was
his
working
time
his
books
and
hymns
had
profited
at
the
cost
of
missing
many
a
generous
subscription
and
at
the
expense
of
social
unity
from
the
outset
scrope
had
set
himself
to
alter
this
a
certain
lack
of
enthusiasm
on
lady
ella
part
had
merely
provoked
him
to
greater
effort
on
his
own
his
ideal
of
what
was
needed
with
the
people
was
something
rather
jolly
and
familiar
something
like
a
very
good
and
successful
french
or
irish
priest
something
that
came
easily
and
readily
into
their
homes
and
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
their
shoulders
the
less
he
liked
these
rich
people
naturally
the
more
familiar
his
resolution
to
be
successfully
intimate
made
him
he
put
down
the
names
and
brief
characteristics
of
their
sons
and
daughters
in
a
little
and
consulted
it
before
every
visit
so
as
to
get
his
most
casual
enquiries
right
and
he
invited
himself
to
the
garstein
fellows
house
on
this
occasion
by
telegram
a
special
mission
and
some
business
in
wombash
may
i
have
a
scrap
of
supper
and
a
bed
now
garstein
fellows
was
a
thoroughly
london
woman
she
was
one
of
the
banking
grunenbaums
the
fair
tall
sort
and
she
had
a
very
decided
tendency
to
smartness
she
had
a
little
party
in
the
house
a
sort
of
long
party
that
made
her
hesitate
for
a
minute
or
so
before
she
framed
a
reply
to
the
bishop
request
it
was
the
intention
of
garstein
fellows
to
succeed
very
conspicuously
in
the
british
world
and
the
british
world
she
felt
was
a
complicated
one
it
is
really
not
one
world
but
several
and
if
you
would
surely
succeed
you
must
keep
your
peace
with
all
the
systems
and
be
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
all
of
them
so
at
least
garstein
fellows
saw
it
and
her
method
was
to
classify
her
acquaintances
according
to
their
systems
to
keep
them
in
their
proper
bundles
and
to
give
every
one
the
treatment
he
or
she
was
accustomed
to
receive
and
since
all
things
british
are
now
changing
and
passing
away
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
record
the
classification
garstein
fellows
adopted
first
she
set
apart
as
most
precious
and
desirable
and
requiring
the
most
careful
treatment
the
court
dowdies
for
so
it
was
that
the
dignity
and
quiet
good
taste
that
radiated
from
buckingham
palace
impressed
her
restless
shallow
mind
the
sort
of
people
who
prefer
pair
horse
carriages
to
automobiles
have
quiet
friendships
in
the
highest
quarters
quietly
do
not
know
any
one
else
busy
themselves
with
charities
dress
richly
rather
than
impressively
and
have
either
little
accomplishments
or
none
at
all
and
no
other
relations
with
at
the
skirts
of
this
crowning
british
world
garstein
fellows
tugged
industriously
and
expensively
she
did
not
keep
a
carriage
and
pair
and
an
old
family
coachman
because
that
she
felt
would
be
considered
pushing
and
presumptuous
she
had
the
sense
to
stick
to
her
common
unpretending
daimler
but
she
wore
a
special
sort
of
blackish
for
such
occasions
as
brought
her
near
the
centre
of
honour
which
she
got
from
a
little
good
shop
known
only
to
very
few
outside
the
inner
ring
which
she
was
always
careful
to
sit
on
for
a
few
minutes
before
wearing
and
it
was
to
this
first
and
highest
and
best
section
of
her
social
scheme
that
she
considered
that
bishops
properly
belonged
but
some
bishops
and
in
particular
such
a
comparatively
bright
bishop
as
the
bishop
of
princhester
she
also
thought
of
as
being
just
as
comfortably
accommodated
in
her
second
system
the
serious
liberal
lot
which
was
more
fatiguing
and
less
boring
which
talked
of
books
and
things
visited
the
bells
went
to
all
when
granville
barker
was
the
producer
and
knew
and
valued
people
in
the
grey
and
earnest
plains
between
the
cecils
and
the
sidney
webbs
and
thirdly
there
were
the
smart
intellectual
lot
again
not
very
well
marked
off
and
on
the
whole
practicable
to
bishops
of
whom
fewer
particulars
are
needed
because
theirs
is
a
perennial
species
and
then
finally
there
was
that
fourth
world
which
was
paradoxically
at
once
very
brilliant
and
a
little
shady
which
had
its
night
club
side
and
seemed
to
set
no
limit
to
its
eccentricities
it
seemed
at
times
to
be
aiming
to
shock
and
yet
it
had
its
standards
but
here
it
was
that
the
dancers
and
actresses
and
forgiven
divorcees
came
in
and
the
bishops
as
a
rule
a
rule
hitherto
always
respected
did
this
was
the
ultimate
world
of
garstein
fellows
she
had
no
use
for
merely
sporting
people
and
the
merely
correct
smart
and
the
duller
county
families
sets
that
led
nowhere
and
it
was
from
her
fourth
system
of
the
glittering
doubtfuls
that
this
party
which
made
her
hesitate
over
the
bishop
telegram
was
derived
she
ran
over
their
names
as
she
sat
considering
her
reply
what
was
there
for
a
bishop
to
object
to
there
was
that
admirable
american
widow
lady
sunderbund
she
was
enormously
rich
she
was
enthusiastic
she
was
really
on
probation
for
higher
levels
it
was
her
decolletage
delayed
her
if
only
she
kept
off
theosophy
and
the
keltic
renascence
and
her
disposition
to
profess
wild
intellectual
passions
there
would
be
no
harm
in
her
provided
she
did
come
down
to
dinner
in
anything
too
fantastically
scanty
but
a
word
in
season
was
possible
no
there
was
no
harm
in
lady
sunderbund
then
there
were
ridgeway
kelso
and
this
dark
excitable
catholic
friend
of
his
paidraig
garstein
fellows
saw
no
harm
in
them
then
one
had
to
consider
lord
gatling
and
lizzie
barusetter
but
nothing
showed
nothing
was
likely
to
show
even
if
there
was
anything
and
besides
was
there
a
church
and
stage
guild
except
for
those
people
there
seemed
little
reason
for
alarm
garstein
fellows
did
not
know
that
professor
hoppart
who
so
amusingly
combined
a
professorship
of
political
economy
with
the
writing
of
lyrics
was
a
keen
amateur
theologian
nor
that
bent
the
sentimental
novelist
had
a
similar
passion
she
did
not
know
that
her
own
eldest
son
a
dark
youngster
from
eton
had
also
come
to
the
theological
stage
of
development
she
did
however
weigh
the
possibilities
of
too
liberal
opinions
on
what
are
called
social
questions
on
the
part
of
miss
sharsper
the
novelist
and
decided
that
if
that
lady
was
watched
nothing
so
terrible
could
be
said
even
in
an
undertone
and
as
for
the
mariposa
the
dancer
she
had
nothing
but
spanish
and
bad
french
she
looked
all
right
and
it
was
very
likely
she
would
go
out
of
her
way
to
startle
an
anglican
bishop
simply
she
need
dance
besides
which
even
if
a
man
does
get
a
glimpse
of
a
little
something
it
is
as
if
it
was
a
woman
but
of
course
if
the
party
must
annoy
the
bishop
the
bishop
must
do
his
duty
by
the
party
there
must
be
the
usual
purple
and
the
silver
buckles
she
wired
back
a
little
party
but
it
wo
put
you
out
send
your
man
with
your
in
making
that
promise
garstein
fellows
reckoned
without
the
morbid
sensibility
of
the
bishop
disorganized
nervous
system
and
the
unsuspected
theological
stirrings
beneath
the
apparent
worldliness
of
hoppart
and
bent
the
trouble
began
in
the
after
dinner
out
of
deference
to
the
bishop
abstinence
the
men
did
not
remain
to
smoke
but
came
in
to
find
the
mariposa
and
lady
sunderbund
smoking
cigarettes
which
these
ladies
continued
to
do
a
little
defiantly
they
had
hoped
to
finish
them
before
the
bishop
came
up
the
night
was
chilly
and
a
cheerful
wood
fire
cracking
and
banging
on
the
fireplace
emphasized
the
ordinary
heating
garstein
fellows
who
had
not
expected
so
prompt
an
appearance
of
the
men
had
arranged
her
chairs
in
a
semicircle
for
a
little
womanly
gossip
and
before
she
could
intervene
she
found
her
party
with
the
exception
of
lord
gatling
who
had
drifted
just
a
little
too
noticeably
with
miss
barnsetter
into
a
window
sitting
round
with
a
conscious
air
that
was
perhaps
just
a
trifle
too
apparent
of
being
and
mr
bent
plunged
boldly
into
general
conversation
are
you
reading
anything
now
garstein
fellows
he
asked
i
an
interested
she
was
standing
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
she
bit
her
lip
and
looked
at
the
cornice
and
meditated
with
a
girlish
expression
yes
she
said
i
am
reading
again
i
did
think
i
should
but
i
for
a
time
said
hoppart
i
read
nothing
but
the
papers
i
bought
from
a
dozen
to
twenty
a
that
is
wearing
off
said
the
bishop
the
first
thing
i
began
to
read
again
said
garstein
fellows
i
not
saying
it
for
your
sake
bishop
was
the
i
went
to
the
bible
said
bent
as
if
he
was
surprised
i
heard
that
before
said
ridgeway
kelso
in
that
slightly
explosive
manner
of
his
all
sorts
of
people
who
do
usually
read
the
bible
but
kelso
protested
their
hostess
with
raised
eyebrows
i
was
thinking
of
bent
but
anyhow
there
been
a
great
wave
of
seriousness
a
sudden
turning
to
religion
and
religious
things
i
know
if
it
comes
your
way
bishop
i
had
no
rows
of
penitents
we
may
be
coming
said
hoppart
he
turned
sideways
to
face
the
bishop
i
think
we
should
be
coming
if
if
it
was
for
old
entangled
difficulties
i
do
know
if
you
will
mind
my
saying
it
to
you
but
the
bishop
returned
his
frank
glance
i
like
to
know
above
all
things
he
said
if
garstein
fellow
will
permit
us
it
my
business
to
we
all
want
to
know
said
lady
sunderbund
speaking
from
the
low
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
there
was
a
vibration
in
her
voice
and
a
sudden
gleam
of
enthusiasm
in
her
face
why
should
people
talk
sometimes
well
take
my
own
case
said
hoppart
in
the
last
few
weeks
been
reading
not
only
in
the
bible
but
in
the
fathers
i
read
most
of
athanasius
most
of
eusebius
and
i
confess
it
gibbon
i
find
all
my
old
wonder
come
back
why
are
we
pinned
to
to
the
amount
of
creed
we
are
pinned
to
why
for
instance
must
you
insist
on
the
trinity
yes
said
the
eton
boy
explosively
and
flushed
darkly
to
find
he
had
spoken
here
is
a
time
when
men
ask
for
god
said
hoppart
and
you
give
them
three
cried
bent
rather
cheaply
i
confess
i
find
the
way
encumbered
by
these
alexandrian
elaborations
hoppart
completed
need
it
be
whispered
lady
sunderbund
very
softly
well
said
the
bishop
and
leant
back
in
his
armchair
and
knitted
his
brow
at
the
fire
i
do
not
think
he
said
that
men
coming
to
god
think
very
much
of
the
nature
of
god
nevertheless
he
spoke
slowly
and
patted
the
arm
of
his
chair
nevertheless
the
church
insists
that
certain
vitally
important
truths
have
to
be
conveyed
certain
mortal
errors
are
best
guarded
against
by
these
you
admit
they
are
so
the
church
has
always
called
hoppart
showed
by
a
little
movement
and
grimace
that
he
thought
the
bishop
quibbled
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
bishop
hastened
to
explain
the
creeds
are
symbolical
it
is
clear
they
seek
to
express
ineffable
things
by
at
least
an
extended
use
of
familiar
words
i
suppose
we
are
all
agreed
nowadays
that
when
we
speak
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
we
mean
something
only
in
a
very
remote
and
exalted
way
parallel
with
with
biological
fatherhood
and
lady
sunderbund
nodded
eagerly
yes
she
said
oh
yes
and
held
up
an
expectant
face
for
more
our
utmost
words
our
most
elaborately
phrased
creeds
can
at
the
best
be
no
better
than
the
shadow
of
something
unseen
thrown
upon
the
screen
of
he
raised
his
rather
weary
eyes
to
hoppart
as
if
he
would
know
what
else
needed
explanation
he
was
gratified
by
lady
sunderbund
approval
but
he
affected
not
to
see
or
hear
it
but
it
was
bent
who
spoke
he
spoke
in
the
most
casual
way
he
made
the
thing
seem
the
most
incidental
of
observations
what
puzzles
me
he
said
is
why
the
early
christians
identified
the
spermaticos
logos
of
the
stoics
with
the
second
and
not
with
the
third
person
of
the
to
which
the
bishop
rising
artlessly
to
the
bait
replied
ah
that
indeed
is
the
unfortunate
aspect
of
the
whole
and
then
the
irish
catholic
came
down
on
him
how
the
bishop
awakened
in
the
night
after
this
dispute
has
been
told
already
in
the
opening
section
of
this
story
to
that
night
of
discomfort
we
now
return
after
this
comprehensive
digression
he
awoke
from
nightmares
of
eyes
and
triangles
to
bottomless
remorse
and
perplexity
for
the
first
time
he
fully
measured
the
vast
distances
he
had
travelled
from
the
beliefs
and
attitudes
of
his
early
training
since
his
coming
to
princhester
travelled
or
rather
slipped
and
fallen
down
the
long
slopes
of
doubt
that
clear
inky
dimness
that
comes
before
dawn
found
his
white
face
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
great
terrace
and
the
park
after
a
bout
of
mental
distress
and
sleeplessness
the
bishop
would
sometimes
wake
in
the
morning
not
so
much
exhausted
as
in
a
state
of
thin
mental
and
bodily
activity
this
was
more
particularly
so
if
the
night
had
produced
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
purpose
so
it
was
on
this
occasion
the
day
was
clear
before
him
at
least
it
could
be
cleared
by
sending
three
telegrams
his
man
could
go
back
to
princhester
and
so
leave
him
perfectly
free
to
go
to
in
london
and
secure
that
friendly
dispensation
to
smoke
again
which
seemed
the
only
alternative
to
a
serious
mental
breakdown
he
would
take
his
bag
stay
the
night
in
london
smoke
sleep
well
and
return
the
next
morning
dunk
his
found
him
already
bathed
and
ready
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
bradshaw
at
seven
he
went
on
dressing
although
the
good
train
for
london
did
not
start
until
garstein
fellows
was
by
nature
and
principle
a
late
riser
the
showed
small
promise
yet
of
the
repast
though
the
table
was
set
and
bright
with
silver
and
fresh
flowers
and
a
wood
fire
popped
and
spurted
to
greet
and
encourage
the
march
sunshine
but
standing
in
the
doorway
that
led
to
the
promise
and
daffodils
and
crocuses
of
garstein
fellows
garden
stood
lady
sunderbund
almost
with
an
effect
of
waiting
and
she
greeted
the
bishop
very
cheerfully
doubted
the
immediate
appearance
of
any
one
else
and
led
him
in
the
most
natural
manner
into
the
new
but
already
very
pleasant
shrubbery
in
some
indefinable
special
way
the
bishop
had
been
aware
of
lady
sunderbund
presence
since
first
he
had
met
her
but
it
was
only
now
that
he
could
observe
her
with
any
particularity
she
was
tall
like
his
own
lady
ella
but
not
calm
and
quiet
she
was
electric
her
eyes
her
smiles
her
complexion
had
as
it
were
an
established
brightness
that
exceeded
the
common
lustre
of
things
this
morning
she
was
dressed
in
grey
that
was
nevertheless
not
grey
but
had
an
effect
of
colour
and
there
was
a
thread
of
black
along
the
lines
of
her
body
and
a
gleam
of
gold
she
carried
her
head
back
with
less
dignity
than
pride
there
was
a
little
frozen
movement
in
her
dark
hair
as
if
it
flamed
up
out
of
her
head
there
were
silver
ornaments
in
her
hair
she
spoke
with
a
pretty
little
weakness
of
the
r
that
had
probably
been
acquired
abroad
and
she
lost
no
time
in
telling
him
she
was
eager
to
tell
him
that
she
had
been
waylaying
him
i
did
so
want
to
talk
to
you
some
maw
she
said
i
was
shy
last
night
and
they
we
all
so
noisy
and
eaga
i
that
you
might
come
down
early
it
an
i
longed
for
she
said
she
did
her
very
pretty
best
to
convey
what
it
was
had
been
troubling
her
bad
been
worrying
her
for
years
life
was
oh
just
ornaments
and
games
and
so
so
unless
it
was
and
she
could
get
it
the
bishop
nodded
his
head
gravely
you
she
pressed
i
understand
too
well
the
attempt
to
get
hold
and
keep
i
knew
you
would
she
cried
she
went
on
with
an
impulsive
rapidity
had
always
her
always
she
had
felt
herself
confronted
by
the
most
insurmountable
difficulties
and
yet
whenever
she
had
gone
away
from
christianity
she
had
gone
away
from
christianity
to
the
theosophists
and
the
christian
scientists
she
had
felt
she
was
only
and
then
suddenly
when
he
was
speaking
last
night
she
had
felt
he
knew
it
was
so
wonderful
to
hear
the
was
only
a
symbol
is
the
proper
name
for
it
said
the
bishop
it
was
for
centuries
it
was
called
the
yes
and
so
what
it
really
meant
was
something
quite
different
from
what
it
did
mean
the
bishop
felt
that
this
sentence
also
was
only
a
symbol
and
nodded
encouragingly
but
gravely
warily
and
there
she
was
and
the
point
was
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
educated
people
like
her
who
were
dying
to
get
through
these
symbols
to
the
true
faith
that
lay
behind
them
that
they
knew
lay
behind
them
she
did
know
if
he
had
read
the
light
under
the
altar
he
vicar
of
wombash
in
my
diocese
said
the
bishop
with
restraint
it
stuff
said
lady
sunderbund
it
cold
but
it
intellectually
but
we
want
that
with
we
want
it
so
badly
if
some
one
she
became
daring
she
bit
her
under
lip
and
flashed
her
spirit
at
him
if
you
she
said
and
paused
could
think
aloud
said
the
bishop
yes
she
said
nodding
rapidly
and
became
breathless
to
hear
it
would
certainly
be
an
astonishing
end
to
the
chasters
difficulty
if
the
bishop
went
over
to
the
heretic
the
bishop
reflected
my
dear
lady
i
wo
disguise
he
began
in
fact
i
do
see
how
i
could
that
for
some
years
i
have
been
growing
more
and
more
discontented
with
some
of
our
most
fundamental
formulae
but
it
been
very
largely
a
shapeless
discontent
hitherto
i
do
think
i
said
a
word
to
a
single
soul
no
not
a
word
you
are
the
first
person
to
whom
i
ever
made
the
admission
that
even
my
feelings
are
at
times
she
lit
up
marvellously
at
his
words
go
on
she
whispered
but
she
did
not
need
to
tell
him
to
go
on
now
that
he
had
once
broached
the
casket
of
his
reserves
he
was
only
too
glad
of
a
listener
he
talked
as
if
they
were
intimate
and
loving
friends
and
so
it
seemed
to
both
of
them
they
were
it
was
a
wonderful
release
from
a
long
and
painful
solitude
to
certain
types
it
is
never
quite
clear
what
has
happened
to
them
until
they
tell
it
so
that
now
the
bishop
punctuated
very
prettily
by
lady
sunderbund
began
to
measure
for
the
first
time
the
extent
of
his
departure
from
the
old
innate
convictions
of
otteringham
rectory
he
said
that
it
was
strange
to
find
doubt
coming
so
late
in
life
but
perhaps
it
was
only
in
recent
years
that
his
faith
had
been
put
to
any
really
severe
tests
it
had
been
sheltered
and
unchallenged
this
fearful
wa
lady
sunderbund
interjected
but
princhester
had
been
a
critical
and
trying
change
and
the
light
under
the
altar
case
had
ploughed
him
deeply
it
was
curious
that
his
doubts
always
seemed
to
have
a
double
strand
there
was
a
moral
objection
based
on
the
church
practical
futility
and
an
intellectual
strand
subordinated
to
this
which
traced
that
futility
largely
to
its
unconvincing
formulae
and
yet
you
know
said
the
bishop
i
find
i
ca
go
with
chasters
he
beats
at
the
church
he
treats
her
as
though
she
were
wrong
i
feel
like
a
son
growing
up
who
finds
his
mother
is
quite
so
nor
quite
so
energetic
as
she
seemed
to
be
once
she
right
i
feel
sure
i
never
doubted
her
fundamental
yes
said
lady
sunderbund
very
eagerly
and
yet
there
this
futility
you
know
my
dear
lady
i
know
what
to
do
one
feels
on
the
one
hand
that
here
is
a
cloud
of
witnesses
great
men
sainted
men
subtle
men
figures
permanently
historical
before
whom
one
can
do
nothing
but
bow
down
in
the
utmost
humility
here
is
a
great
instrument
and
organization
what
would
the
world
be
without
the
witness
of
the
church
and
on
the
other
hand
here
are
our
masses
out
of
hand
and
hostile
our
industrial
leaders
equally
hostile
there
is
a
failure
to
grip
and
that
failure
to
grip
is
so
clearly
traceable
to
the
fact
that
our
ideas
are
not
modern
ideas
that
when
we
come
to
profess
our
faith
we
find
nothing
in
our
mouths
but
antiquated
alexandrian
subtleties
and
phrases
and
ideas
that
may
have
been
quite
alive
quite
significant
quite
adequate
in
asia
minor
or
egypt
among
men
essentially
orientals
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
but
which
now
he
expressed
just
what
they
came
to
now
by
a
gesture
she
echoed
his
gesture
probably
i
not
alone
among
my
brethren
he
went
on
and
then
but
what
is
one
to
do
with
her
hands
she
acted
her
sense
of
his
difficulty
one
may
be
precipitate
he
said
there
a
kind
of
loyalty
and
discipline
that
requires
one
to
keep
the
ranks
until
one
course
of
action
is
perfectly
clear
one
owes
so
much
to
so
many
one
has
to
consider
how
one
may
affect
oh
people
one
has
never
he
was
lugging
things
now
into
speech
that
so
far
had
been
scarcely
above
the
threshold
of
his
conscious
thought
he
went
on
to
discuss
the
entire
position
of
the
disbelieving
cleric
he
discovered
a
fine
point
if
there
was
something
else
an
alternative
another
religion
another
church
to
which
one
could
go
the
whole
case
would
be
different
but
to
go
from
the
church
to
nothingness
is
to
go
from
falsehood
to
truth
it
to
go
from
truth
rather
badly
expressed
rather
conservatively
hidden
by
its
protections
truth
in
an
antiquated
costume
to
the
blackest
lie
in
the
she
took
that
point
very
brightly
one
must
hold
fast
to
she
said
and
looked
earnestly
at
him
and
gripped
fiercely
pink
thumbs
out
with
her
beautiful
hands
held
up
that
was
it
exactly
he
too
was
gripping
but
while
on
the
outside
the
midianites
of
denial
were
prowling
for
these
clinging
souls
within
the
camp
they
were
assailed
by
a
meticulous
orthodoxy
that
was
only
too
eager
to
cast
them
forth
the
bishop
dwelt
for
a
time
upon
the
curious
fierceness
orthodoxy
would
sometimes
display
nowadays
atheism
can
be
civil
can
be
generous
it
is
orthodoxy
that
trails
a
scurrilous
fringe
who
was
that
young
man
with
a
strong
irish
accent
who
contradicted
me
so
suddenly
he
asked
the
dark
young
man
the
noisy
young
that
was
mist
he
is
a
kelt
and
all
that
spells
with
eva
so
many
letters
you
know
they
say
he
spends
ouas
and
ouas
he
about
it
they
all
to
and
it
them
and
makes
them
hate
england
moa
and
he
is
orthodox
he
is
what
i
call
orthodox
to
the
ridiculous
a
gong
proclaimed
breakfast
over
a
square
mile
or
so
of
territory
and
lady
sunderbund
turned
about
mechanically
towards
the
house
but
they
continued
their
discussion
she
started
indeed
a
new
topic
shall
we
eva
do
think
have
a
new
and
betta
that
was
a
revolutionary
idea
to
him
he
was
still
fending
it
off
from
him
when
a
gap
in
the
shrubs
brought
them
within
sight
of
the
house
and
of
garstein
fellows
on
the
portico
waving
a
handkerchief
and
crying
i
wish
we
could
talk
for
houas
said
lady
sunderbund
i
been
glad
of
this
talk
said
the
bishop
very
she
lifted
her
soft
abundant
skirts
and
trotted
briskly
across
the
still
dewy
lawn
towards
the
house
door
the
bishop
followed
gravely
and
slowly
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
an
unusually
peaceful
expression
upon
his
face
he
was
thinking
how
rare
and
precious
a
thing
it
is
to
find
intelligent
friendship
in
women
more
particularly
when
they
were
dazzlingly
charming
and
pretty
it
was
strange
but
this
was
really
his
first
woman
friend
if
as
he
hoped
she
became
his
friend
lady
sunderbund
entered
the
breakfast
room
in
a
gusty
abundance
like
botticelli
primavera
and
kissed
garstein
fellows
she
exhaled
a
glowing
happiness
he
is
wondyful
she
panted
he
is
most
mr
hidgeway
kelso
no
the
dee
bishop
i
love
him
are
those
the
little
sausages
i
like
may
i
take
i
been
up
the
dee
bishop
appeared
in
the
sunlit
doorway
the
bishop
felt
more
contentment
in
the
london
train
than
he
had
felt
for
many
weeks
he
had
taken
two
decisive
and
relieving
steps
one
was
that
he
had
stated
his
case
to
another
human
being
and
that
a
very
charming
and
sympathetic
human
being
he
was
no
longer
a
prey
to
a
current
of
secret
and
concealed
thoughts
running
counter
to
all
the
appearances
of
his
outward
life
and
the
other
was
that
he
was
now
within
an
hour
or
so
of
and
a
cigarette
he
would
lunch
on
the
train
get
to
london
about
two
take
a
taxi
at
once
to
the
wise
old
doctor
catch
him
over
his
coffee
in
a
charitable
and
understanding
mood
and
perhaps
be
smoking
a
cigarette
publicly
and
honourably
and
altogether
satisfyingly
before
three
so
far
as
door
this
program
was
fulfilled
without
a
hitch
the
day
was
fine
and
he
had
his
taxi
opened
and
noted
with
a
patriotic
satisfaction
as
he
rattled
through
the
streets
the
glare
of
the
recruiting
posters
on
every
vacant
piece
of
wall
and
the
increasing
number
of
men
in
khaki
in
the
streets
but
at
the
door
he
had
a
disappointment
was
away
at
the
front
of
all
places
he
had
gone
for
some
weeks
would
the
bishop
like
to
see
dale
the
bishop
hesitated
he
had
never
set
eyes
on
this
dale
indeed
he
had
never
heard
of
dale
seeing
his
old
friend
and
being
gently
and
tactfully
told
to
do
exactly
what
he
was
longing
to
do
was
one
thing
facing
some
strange
doctor
and
going
slowly
and
elaborately
through
the
whole
story
of
his
illness
his
vow
and
his
breakdown
and
perhaps
having
his
reaction
time
tested
and
all
sorts
of
stripping
and
soundings
done
was
quite
another
he
was
within
an
ace
of
turning
away
if
he
had
turned
away
his
whole
subsequent
life
would
have
been
different
it
was
the
very
slightest
thing
in
the
world
tipped
the
beam
it
was
the
thought
that
after
all
whatever
inconvenience
and
unpleasantness
there
might
be
in
this
interview
there
was
at
the
end
of
it
a
very
reasonable
prospect
of
a
restored
and
legitimate
cigarette
chapter
the
fifth
the
first
vision
dale
exceeded
the
bishop
worst
apprehensions
he
was
a
lean
lank
dark
young
man
with
long
black
hair
and
irregular
rather
prolonged
features
his
chin
was
right
over
to
the
left
he
looked
constantly
at
the
bishop
face
with
a
distinctly
sceptical
grey
eye
he
could
not
have
looked
harder
if
he
had
been
a
photographer
or
a
portrait
painter
and
his
voice
was
harsh
and
the
bishop
was
particularly
sensitive
to
voices
he
began
by
understanding
far
too
much
of
the
bishop
illness
and
he
insisted
on
various
familiarities
with
the
bishop
heart
and
tongue
and
eye
and
knee
that
ruffled
the
bishop
soul
talked
of
neurasthenia
he
asked
that
was
his
diagnosis
said
the
bishop
neurasthenia
said
the
young
man
as
though
he
despised
the
word
the
bishop
went
on
buttoning
up
his
coat
you
do
of
course
want
to
break
your
vows
about
drinking
and
smoking
said
the
young
man
with
the
very
faintest
suggestion
of
derision
in
his
voice
not
if
it
can
possibly
be
avoided
the
bishop
asserted
without
a
loss
that
is
of
practical
efficiency
he
added
for
i
have
much
to
i
think
that
it
is
possible
to
keep
your
vow
said
the
young
man
and
the
bishop
could
have
sworn
at
him
i
think
we
can
manage
that
all
the
bishop
sat
at
the
table
resting
his
arm
upon
it
and
awaiting
the
next
development
of
this
unsatisfactory
interview
he
was
on
the
verge
of
asking
as
unpleasantly
as
possible
when
would
return
the
young
man
stood
upon
and
was
evidently
contemplating
dissertations
of
course
he
said
as
though
he
discussed
a
problem
with
himself
you
must
have
some
sort
of
comfort
you
must
get
out
of
this
state
one
way
or
the
bishop
nodded
assent
he
had
faint
hopes
of
this
young
man
ideas
of
comfort
dale
reflected
then
he
went
off
away
from
the
question
of
comfort
altogether
you
see
the
trouble
in
such
a
case
as
this
is
peculiarly
difficult
to
trace
to
its
sources
because
it
comes
just
upon
the
of
bodily
and
mental
things
you
may
take
a
drug
or
alter
your
regimen
and
it
disturbs
your
thoughts
you
may
take
an
idea
and
it
disturbs
your
health
it
is
easy
enough
to
say
as
some
do
that
all
ideas
have
a
physical
substratum
it
is
almost
as
easy
to
say
with
the
christian
scientist
that
all
bodily
states
are
amenable
to
our
ideas
the
truth
does
i
think
follow
the
border
between
those
opposite
opinions
very
exactly
on
either
side
i
ca
for
instance
tell
you
to
go
home
and
pray
against
these
uncertainties
and
despairs
because
it
is
just
these
uncertainties
and
despairs
that
rob
you
of
the
power
of
efficient
he
did
not
seem
to
expect
anything
from
the
bishop
i
do
see
that
because
a
case
brings
one
suddenly
right
up
against
the
frontier
of
metaphysics
why
a
doctor
should
necessarily
pull
up
short
at
that
why
one
should
go
on
into
either
metaphysics
or
psychology
if
such
an
extension
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
the
case
at
any
rate
if
you
permit
it
in
this
consultation
go
on
said
the
bishop
holding
on
to
that
promise
of
comfort
the
best
thing
is
to
thrash
out
the
case
in
your
own
way
and
then
come
to
what
is
what
is
really
the
matter
here
the
matter
with
you
that
is
is
a
disorganization
of
your
tests
of
reality
it
one
of
a
group
of
states
hitherto
confused
neurasthenia
that
comprehensive
phrase
well
it
is
one
of
the
neurasthenias
here
i
confess
i
begin
to
talk
of
work
i
am
doing
work
still
to
be
published
finished
first
and
then
published
but
i
go
off
from
the
idea
that
every
living
being
lives
in
a
state
not
differing
essentially
from
a
state
of
hallucination
concerning
the
things
about
it
truth
essential
truth
is
hidden
always
of
course
there
must
be
a
measure
of
truth
in
our
working
illusions
a
working
measure
of
truth
or
the
creature
would
smash
itself
up
and
end
itself
but
beyond
that
discretion
of
the
fire
and
the
pitfall
lies
a
wide
margin
of
error
about
which
we
may
be
deceived
for
years
so
long
as
it
does
matter
it
does
matter
i
do
know
if
i
make
myself
i
follow
you
said
the
bishop
a
little
wearily
i
follow
you
phenomena
and
noumena
and
so
on
and
so
on
kant
and
so
forth
pragmatism
with
a
sigh
and
all
that
completed
dale
in
a
voice
that
suggested
mockery
but
you
see
we
grow
into
a
way
of
life
we
settle
down
among
habits
and
conventions
we
say
is
all
right
and
is
always
so
we
get
more
and
more
settled
into
our
life
as
a
whole
and
more
and
more
confident
unless
something
happens
to
shake
us
out
of
our
sphere
of
illusion
that
may
be
some
violent
contradictory
fact
some
accident
or
it
may
be
some
subtle
change
in
one
health
and
nerves
that
makes
us
feel
doubtful
or
a
change
of
habits
or
as
i
believe
some
subtle
quickening
of
the
critical
faculty
then
suddenly
comes
the
feeling
as
though
we
were
lost
in
a
strange
world
as
though
we
had
never
really
seen
the
world
he
paused
the
bishop
was
reluctantly
interested
that
does
describe
something
of
the
mental
side
he
admitted
i
never
believe
in
concealing
my
own
thoughts
from
an
intelligent
patient
said
dale
with
a
quiet
offensiveness
that
sort
of
thing
belongs
to
the
dark
ages
of
the
art
i
will
tell
you
exactly
my
guesses
and
suppositions
about
you
at
the
base
of
it
all
is
a
slight
and
subtle
kidney
trouble
due
i
suggest
to
your
going
to
princhester
and
drinking
the
local
water
but
it
excellent
water
they
boast
of
by
all
the
established
tests
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
our
best
drinking
waters
have
all
sorts
of
unspecified
qualities
burton
water
for
example
is
radioactive
by
beetham
standards
up
to
the
ninth
degree
but
that
is
by
the
way
my
theory
about
your
case
is
that
this
produced
a
change
in
your
blood
that
quickened
your
sensibilities
and
your
critical
faculties
just
at
a
time
when
a
good
many
bothers
i
of
course
know
what
they
were
but
i
can
so
to
speak
see
the
marks
all
over
you
came
into
your
the
bishop
nodded
you
were
uprooted
you
moved
from
house
to
house
and
failed
to
get
that
curled
up
safe
feeling
one
has
in
a
real
home
in
any
of
if
you
saw
the
fireplaces
and
the
general
decoration
of
the
new
palace
admitted
the
bishop
i
had
practically
no
that
confirms
me
said
dale
insomnia
followed
and
increased
the
feeling
of
physical
strangeness
by
increasing
the
bodily
disturbance
i
suspect
an
intellectual
he
paused
there
was
said
the
bishop
you
were
no
longer
at
home
anywhere
you
were
no
longer
at
home
in
your
diocese
in
your
palace
in
your
body
in
your
convictions
and
then
came
the
war
quite
apart
from
everything
else
the
mind
of
the
whole
world
is
suffering
profoundly
from
the
shock
of
this
war
much
more
than
is
generally
admitted
one
thing
you
did
that
you
probably
did
not
observe
yourself
doing
you
drank
rather
more
at
your
meals
you
smoked
a
lot
more
that
was
your
natural
and
proper
response
to
the
ah
said
the
bishop
and
brightened
up
it
was
remarked
by
tolstoy
i
think
that
few
intellectual
men
would
really
tolerate
the
world
as
it
is
if
it
were
not
for
smoking
and
drinking
even
novelists
have
their
moments
of
lucidity
certainly
these
things
soothe
the
restlessness
in
men
minds
deaden
their
sceptical
sensibilities
and
just
at
the
time
when
you
were
getting
most
dislodged
you
gave
them
and
the
sooner
i
go
back
to
them
the
better
said
the
bishop
brightly
i
quite
see
i
would
say
that
said
dale
that
said
dale
is
just
where
my
treatment
of
this
case
differs
from
the
treatment
of
he
spoke
the
name
reluctantly
as
if
he
disliked
the
mere
sound
of
it
dr
hitherto
of
course
said
the
bishop
i
been
in
his
he
said
dale
would
certainly
set
about
trying
to
restore
your
old
sphere
of
illusion
your
old
familiar
sensations
and
ideas
and
confidences
he
would
in
fact
turn
you
back
he
would
restore
all
your
habits
he
would
order
you
a
rest
he
would
send
you
off
to
some
holiday
resort
fresh
in
fact
but
familiar
in
character
the
high
lands
north
italy
or
switzerland
for
example
he
would
forbid
you
newspapers
and
order
you
to
botanize
and
prescribe
tranquillizing
reading
novels
the
life
of
gladstone
the
works
of
benson
memoirs
and
so
on
you
go
somewhere
where
there
was
a
good
anglican
chaplain
and
you
take
some
of
the
services
yourself
and
we
wash
out
the
effects
of
the
princhester
water
with
contrexeville
and
afterwards
put
you
on
salutaris
or
perrier
i
do
know
whether
i
should
have
inclined
to
some
such
treatment
before
the
war
began
only
he
paused
you
think
dale
face
betrayed
a
sudden
sombre
passion
it
wo
do
now
he
said
in
a
voice
of
quiet
intensity
it
wo
do
he
remained
darkly
silent
for
so
long
that
at
last
the
bishop
spoke
then
what
he
asked
do
you
suggest
suppose
we
do
try
to
go
back
said
dale
suppose
we
go
on
and
go
where
to
reality
i
know
it
doubtful
i
know
it
dangerous
he
went
on
but
i
am
convinced
that
now
we
can
no
longer
keep
men
minds
and
souls
in
these
feathered
nests
these
spheres
of
illusion
behind
these
veils
there
is
either
god
or
the
darkness
why
should
we
not
go
on
the
bishop
was
profoundly
perplexed
he
heard
himself
speaking
it
would
be
unworthy
of
my
cloth
he
was
saying
dale
completed
the
sentence
to
go
let
me
explain
a
little
more
he
said
what
i
mean
by
on
i
think
that
this
loosening
of
the
ties
of
association
that
bind
a
man
to
his
everyday
life
and
his
everyday
self
is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
loosening
of
the
ties
that
bind
him
to
everyday
sanity
one
common
form
of
this
detachment
is
the
form
you
have
in
those
cases
of
people
who
are
found
wandering
unaware
of
their
names
unaware
of
their
places
of
residence
lost
altogether
from
themselves
they
have
not
only
lost
their
sense
of
identity
with
themselves
but
all
the
circumstances
of
their
lives
have
faded
out
of
their
minds
like
an
idle
story
in
a
book
that
has
been
read
and
put
aside
i
have
looked
into
hundreds
of
such
cases
i
do
think
that
loss
of
identity
is
a
necessary
thing
just
another
side
of
the
general
weakening
of
the
grip
upon
reality
a
kind
of
anaemia
of
the
brain
so
that
interest
fades
and
fails
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
forget
a
story
because
you
do
not
believe
it
if
your
brain
is
strong
enough
to
hold
it
but
if
your
brain
is
tired
and
weak
then
so
soon
as
you
lose
faith
in
your
records
your
mind
is
glad
to
let
them
go
when
you
see
these
lost
identity
people
that
is
always
your
first
impression
a
tired
brain
that
has
let
the
bishop
felt
extremely
like
letting
go
but
how
does
this
apply
to
my
case
i
come
to
that
said
dale
holding
up
a
long
large
hand
what
if
we
treat
this
case
of
yours
in
a
new
way
what
if
we
give
you
not
narcotics
but
stimulants
and
tonics
what
if
we
so
touch
the
blood
that
we
increase
your
sense
of
physical
detachment
while
at
the
same
time
feeding
up
your
senses
to
a
new
and
more
vivid
apprehension
of
things
about
you
he
looked
at
his
patient
hesitation
and
added
you
lose
all
that
craving
feeling
that
you
fancy
at
present
is
just
the
need
of
a
smoke
the
world
might
grow
a
trifle
transparent
but
you
keep
real
instead
of
drugging
oneself
back
to
the
old
contentment
you
drug
me
on
to
the
new
said
the
bishop
but
just
one
word
more
said
dale
hear
why
i
would
do
this
it
was
easy
and
successful
to
rest
and
drug
people
back
to
their
old
states
of
mind
when
the
world
was
changing
was
spinning
round
in
the
wildest
tornado
of
change
that
it
has
ever
been
in
but
now
where
can
i
send
you
for
a
rest
where
can
i
send
you
to
get
you
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
catastrophe
of
course
old
would
go
on
sending
people
away
for
rest
and
a
nice
little
soothing
change
if
the
day
of
judgment
was
coming
in
the
sky
and
the
earth
was
opening
and
the
sea
was
giving
up
its
dead
he
send
to
the
seaside
such
things
as
that
would
shake
his
faith
in
the
channel
crossing
my
idea
is
that
it
not
only
right
for
you
to
go
through
with
this
but
that
it
the
only
thing
to
do
if
you
go
right
on
and
right
through
with
these
doubts
and
intimations
he
paused
you
may
die
like
a
madman
he
said
but
you
wo
die
like
a
tame
the
bishop
sat
reflecting
what
fascinated
and
attracted
him
was
the
ending
of
all
the
cravings
and
uneasinesses
and
restlessness
that
had
distressed
his
life
for
over
four
years
what
deterred
him
was
the
personality
of
this
gaunt
young
man
with
his
long
grey
face
his
excited
manner
his
shock
of
black
hair
he
wanted
that
tonic
with
grave
misgivings
if
you
think
this
tonic
is
the
wiser
course
he
began
i
give
it
you
if
you
were
my
father
said
dale
i
got
everything
for
it
he
added
you
mean
you
can
make
it
up
without
a
i
ca
give
you
a
prescription
the
essence
of
it
it
a
distillate
i
have
been
trying
it
is
in
the
again
the
bishop
had
a
twinge
of
misgiving
but
in
the
end
he
succumbed
he
did
want
to
take
the
stuff
but
also
he
did
not
want
to
go
without
his
promised
comfort
presently
dale
had
given
him
a
little
phial
and
was
holding
up
to
the
window
a
small
medicine
glass
into
which
he
was
pouring
very
carefully
twenty
drops
of
the
precious
fluid
take
it
only
he
said
when
you
feel
you
it
is
the
most
golden
of
liquids
said
the
bishop
peering
at
it
when
you
want
more
i
will
make
you
more
later
of
course
it
will
be
possible
to
write
a
prescription
now
add
the
water
so
it
becomes
opalescent
how
beautifully
the
light
plays
in
it
take
the
bishop
dismissed
his
last
discretion
and
drank
well
said
dale
i
am
still
here
said
the
bishop
smiling
and
feeling
a
joyous
tingling
throughout
his
body
it
stirs
the
bishop
stood
on
the
pavement
outside
house
the
massive
door
had
closed
behind
him
it
had
been
an
act
of
courage
of
rashness
if
you
will
to
take
this
draught
he
was
acutely
introspective
ready
for
anything
for
the
most
disagreeable
or
the
most
bizarre
sensations
he
was
asking
himself
were
his
feet
steady
was
his
head
swimming
his
doubts
glowed
into
assurance
suddenly
he
perceived
that
he
was
sure
of
god
not
perhaps
of
the
god
of
nicaea
but
what
did
these
poor
little
quibblings
and
definitions
of
the
theologians
matter
he
had
been
worrying
about
these
definitions
and
quibblings
for
four
long
restless
years
now
they
were
just
failures
to
express
what
surely
every
one
knew
and
no
one
would
ever
express
exactly
because
here
was
god
and
the
kingdom
of
god
was
manifestly
at
hand
the
visible
world
hung
before
him
as
a
mist
might
hang
before
the
rising
sun
he
stood
proudly
and
masterfully
facing
a
universe
that
had
heretofore
bullied
him
into
doubt
and
apologetics
a
universe
that
had
hitherto
been
opaque
and
was
now
betrayed
translucent
that
was
the
first
effect
of
the
new
tonic
complete
reassurance
complete
courage
he
turned
to
walk
towards
mount
street
and
berkeley
square
as
a
sultan
might
turn
to
walk
among
his
slaves
but
the
tonic
was
only
beginning
before
he
had
gone
a
dozen
steps
he
was
aware
that
he
seemed
more
solid
and
larger
than
the
people
about
him
they
had
all
a
curious
miniature
effect
as
though
he
was
looking
at
them
through
the
wrong
end
of
an
opera
glass
the
houses
on
either
side
of
the
street
and
the
traffic
shared
this
quality
in
an
equal
measure
it
was
as
if
he
was
looking
at
the
world
through
apertures
in
a
miniature
cinematograph
this
surprised
him
and
a
little
dashed
his
first
glow
of
satisfaction
he
passed
a
man
in
khaki
who
he
fancied
looked
at
him
with
an
odd
expression
he
observed
the
next
narrowly
and
suspiciously
a
couple
of
smartish
young
men
a
lady
with
a
poodle
a
grocer
boy
with
a
basket
but
none
seemed
to
observe
anything
remarkable
about
him
then
he
caught
the
eye
of
a
and
became
doubtful
again
he
had
a
feeling
that
this
tonic
was
still
coming
in
like
a
tide
it
seemed
to
be
filling
him
and
distending
him
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
already
full
after
four
years
of
flaccidity
it
was
pleasant
to
be
distended
again
but
already
he
felt
more
filled
than
he
had
ever
been
before
at
present
nothing
was
showing
but
all
his
body
seemed
braced
and
uplifted
he
must
be
careful
not
to
become
inflated
in
his
bearing
and
yet
it
was
difficult
not
to
betray
a
little
inflation
he
was
so
filled
with
assurance
that
things
were
right
with
him
and
that
god
was
there
with
him
after
all
it
was
not
mere
fancy
he
was
looking
through
the
peepholes
of
his
eyes
at
the
world
of
illusion
and
appearance
the
world
that
was
so
intent
upon
its
immediate
business
so
regardless
of
eternal
things
that
had
so
dominated
him
but
a
little
while
ago
was
after
all
a
thing
more
mortal
than
himself
another
man
in
khaki
passed
him
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
war
as
something
measurable
as
something
with
a
beginning
and
an
end
as
something
less
than
the
immortal
spirit
in
man
he
had
been
too
much
oppressed
by
it
he
perceived
all
these
people
in
the
street
were
too
much
oppressed
by
it
he
wanted
to
tell
them
as
much
tell
them
that
all
was
well
with
them
bid
them
be
of
good
cheer
he
wanted
to
bless
them
he
found
his
arm
floating
up
towards
gestures
of
benediction
became
increasingly
difficult
all
the
way
down
berkeley
square
the
bishop
was
in
struggle
with
himself
he
was
trying
to
control
himself
trying
to
keep
within
bounds
he
felt
that
he
was
stepping
too
high
that
his
feet
were
not
properly
reaching
the
ground
that
he
was
walking
upon
cushions
of
air
the
feeling
of
largeness
increased
and
the
feeling
of
transparency
in
things
about
him
he
avoided
collision
with
excessively
and
he
felt
his
attention
was
being
drawn
more
and
more
to
something
that
was
going
on
beyond
the
veil
of
visible
things
he
was
in
piccadilly
now
but
at
the
same
time
piccadilly
was
very
small
and
he
was
walking
in
the
presence
of
god
he
had
a
feeling
that
god
was
there
though
he
could
not
see
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
in
this
transitory
world
with
people
going
to
and
fro
men
with
umbrellas
tucked
dangerously
under
their
arms
men
in
a
hurry
policemen
young
women
rattling
red
cross
collecting
boxes
smart
people
loafers
they
distracted
one
from
god
he
set
out
to
cross
the
road
just
opposite
prince
and
jumping
needlessly
to
give
way
to
an
omnibus
had
the
narrowest
escape
from
a
taxicab
he
paused
on
the
pavement
edge
to
recover
himself
the
shock
of
his
near
escape
had
as
people
say
pulled
him
together
what
was
he
to
do
manifestly
this
opalescent
draught
was
overpowering
him
he
ought
never
to
have
taken
it
he
ought
to
have
listened
to
the
voice
of
his
misgivings
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
walk
about
the
streets
he
was
what
had
been
dale
term
losing
his
sense
of
reality
what
was
he
to
do
he
was
alarmed
but
not
dismayed
his
thoughts
were
as
as
the
rest
of
his
being
they
came
throbbing
and
bumping
into
his
mind
what
was
he
to
do
ought
never
to
have
left
his
practice
in
the
hands
of
this
experimenter
strange
that
after
a
lifetime
of
discretion
and
men
respect
one
should
be
standing
on
the
piccadilly
pavement
intoxicated
it
came
into
his
head
that
he
was
not
so
very
far
from
the
athenaeum
and
surely
there
if
anywhere
a
bishop
may
recover
his
sense
of
being
ordinary
and
behind
everything
behind
the
tall
buildings
and
the
swarming
people
there
was
still
the
sense
of
a
wide
illuminated
space
of
a
light
of
wonder
and
a
presence
but
he
must
not
give
way
to
that
again
he
had
already
given
way
altogether
too
much
he
repeated
to
himself
in
a
whisper
i
am
in
if
he
kept
tight
hold
upon
himself
he
felt
he
might
get
to
the
athenaeum
before
before
anything
more
happened
he
murmured
directions
to
himself
keep
along
the
pavement
turn
to
the
right
at
the
circus
now
down
the
hill
easily
down
the
hill
float
junior
army
and
navy
stores
and
the
and
presently
he
had
a
doubt
of
his
name
and
began
to
repeat
it
edward
princhester
edward
scrope
lord
bishop
of
and
all
the
while
voices
within
him
were
asserting
you
are
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
you
are
in
the
presence
of
god
place
and
time
are
a
texture
of
illusion
and
dreamland
even
now
you
are
with
the
porter
of
the
athenaeum
saw
him
come
in
looking
well
flushed
indeed
but
queer
in
expression
his
blue
eyes
were
wide
open
and
unusually
vague
and
blue
he
wandered
across
towards
the
hesitated
went
to
look
at
the
news
seemed
in
doubt
whether
he
would
not
go
into
the
and
then
went
very
slowly
upstairs
past
the
golden
angel
up
to
the
great
in
the
he
found
only
sir
james
mounce
the
man
who
knew
the
novels
of
sir
walter
scott
by
heart
and
had
the
minutest
and
most
unsparing
knowledge
of
every
detail
in
the
life
of
that
supreme
giant
of
english
literature
he
had
even
it
was
said
acquired
a
scotch
burr
in
the
enthusiasm
of
his
it
was
usually
sufficient
only
to
turn
an
ear
towards
him
for
him
to
talk
for
an
hour
or
so
he
was
now
studying
bradshaw
the
bishop
snatched
at
him
desperately
he
felt
that
if
he
went
away
there
would
be
no
hold
left
upon
the
ordinary
things
of
life
sir
james
he
said
i
was
wondering
the
other
day
when
was
the
exact
date
of
the
earliest
public
ascription
of
waverley
to
eh
said
sir
james
but
i
like
to
talk
that
over
with
ye
indeed
i
would
it
would
be
depending
very
largely
on
what
ye
called
but
he
explained
something
about
an
engagement
in
birmingham
that
night
a
train
to
catch
reluctantly
but
relentlessly
he
abandoned
the
proffered
ear
but
he
promised
that
the
next
time
they
met
in
the
club
he
would
go
into
the
matter
the
door
closed
upon
him
the
bishop
was
alone
he
was
flooded
with
the
light
of
the
world
that
is
beyond
this
world
the
things
about
him
became
very
small
and
indistinct
he
would
take
himself
into
a
quiet
corner
in
the
library
of
this
house
and
sit
his
little
body
down
in
one
of
the
miniature
armchairs
then
if
he
was
going
to
faint
or
if
the
trancelike
feeling
was
to
become
altogether
a
trance
well
a
bishop
asleep
in
an
armchair
in
the
library
of
the
athenaeum
is
nothing
to
startle
any
one
he
thought
of
that
convenient
hidden
room
the
north
library
in
which
is
the
bust
of
croker
there
often
one
can
be
quite
alone
it
was
empty
and
he
went
across
to
the
window
that
looks
out
upon
pall
mall
and
sat
down
in
the
little
uncomfortable
easy
chair
by
the
desk
with
its
back
to
the
benvenuto
cellini
and
as
he
sat
down
something
snapped
like
the
snapping
of
a
lute
string
in
his
brain
with
a
sigh
of
deep
relief
the
bishop
realized
that
this
world
had
vanished
he
was
in
a
golden
light
he
perceived
it
as
a
place
but
it
was
a
place
without
buildings
or
trees
or
any
very
definite
features
there
was
a
cloudy
suggestion
of
distant
hills
and
beneath
his
feet
were
little
flowers
and
a
feeling
of
divinity
and
infinite
friendliness
pervaded
his
being
his
impressions
grew
more
definite
his
feet
seemed
to
be
bare
he
was
no
longer
a
bishop
nor
clad
as
a
bishop
that
had
gone
with
the
rest
of
the
world
he
was
seated
on
a
slab
of
starry
rock
this
he
knew
quite
clearly
was
the
place
of
god
he
was
unable
to
disentangle
thoughts
from
words
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
in
his
mind
i
have
been
very
foolish
and
confused
and
perplexed
i
have
been
like
a
creature
caught
among
you
served
the
purpose
of
god
among
those
it
seemed
to
him
at
first
that
the
answer
also
was
among
his
thoughts
i
seemed
so
silly
and
so
little
my
wits
were
clay
full
of
such
desires
blind
desires
that
will
presently
come
to
the
shall
we
come
to
the
light
but
here
it
is
and
you
see
it
it
became
clearer
in
the
mind
of
the
bishop
that
a
figure
sat
beside
him
a
figure
of
great
strength
and
beauty
with
a
smiling
face
and
kindly
eyes
a
strange
thought
and
a
strange
courage
came
to
the
bishop
tell
me
he
whispered
are
you
god
i
am
the
angel
of
the
bishop
thought
over
that
for
some
moments
i
want
he
said
to
know
about
god
i
want
he
said
with
a
deepening
passion
of
the
soul
to
know
about
god
slowly
through
four
long
years
i
have
been
awakening
to
the
need
of
god
body
and
soul
i
am
sick
for
the
want
of
god
and
the
knowledge
of
god
i
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
why
my
life
had
become
so
disordered
and
confused
that
my
very
appetites
and
habits
are
all
astray
but
i
am
perishing
for
god
as
a
waterless
man
upon
a
raft
perishes
for
drink
and
there
is
nothing
but
madness
if
i
touch
the
seas
about
me
not
only
in
my
thoughts
but
in
my
under
thoughts
and
in
my
nerves
and
bones
and
arteries
i
have
need
of
god
you
see
i
grew
up
in
the
delusion
that
i
knew
god
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
unprovisioned
and
unprovided
against
the
tests
and
strains
and
hardships
of
life
i
thought
that
i
was
secure
and
safe
i
was
told
that
we
men
who
were
apes
not
a
quarter
of
a
million
years
ago
who
still
have
hair
upon
our
arms
and
ape
teeth
in
our
jaws
had
come
to
the
full
and
perfect
knowledge
of
god
it
was
all
put
into
a
creed
not
a
word
of
it
was
to
be
altered
not
a
sentence
was
to
be
doubted
any
more
they
made
me
a
teacher
of
this
creed
they
seemed
to
explain
it
to
me
and
when
i
came
to
look
into
it
when
my
need
came
and
i
turned
to
my
creed
it
was
old
and
shrivelled
up
it
was
the
speculations
of
vanished
greeks
and
egyptians
it
was
a
mummy
of
ancient
disputes
old
and
dry
that
fell
to
dust
as
i
unwrapped
it
and
i
was
dressed
up
in
the
dress
of
old
dead
times
and
put
before
an
altar
of
forgotten
sacrifices
and
i
went
through
ceremonies
as
old
as
the
first
seedtime
and
suddenly
i
knew
clearly
that
god
was
not
there
god
was
not
in
my
creed
not
in
my
cathedral
not
in
my
ceremonies
nowhere
in
my
life
and
at
the
same
time
i
knew
i
knew
as
i
had
never
known
before
that
certainly
there
was
he
paused
tell
me
said
the
friend
at
his
side
tell
it
was
as
if
a
child
running
beside
its
mother
looked
up
and
saw
that
he
had
never
seen
her
face
before
that
she
was
not
his
mother
and
that
the
words
he
had
seemed
to
understand
were
now
that
he
listened
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
you
see
i
am
but
a
common
sort
of
man
dear
god
i
have
neither
lived
nor
thought
in
any
way
greatly
i
have
gone
from
one
day
to
the
next
day
without
looking
very
much
farther
than
the
end
of
the
day
i
have
gone
on
as
life
has
befallen
if
no
great
trouble
had
come
into
my
life
so
i
should
have
lived
to
the
end
of
my
days
but
life
which
began
for
me
easily
and
safely
has
become
constantly
more
difficult
and
strange
i
could
have
held
my
services
and
given
my
benedictions
i
could
have
believed
i
believed
in
what
i
thought
i
believed
but
now
i
am
lost
and
astray
crying
out
for
god
let
us
talk
a
little
about
your
troubles
said
the
angel
let
us
talk
about
god
and
this
creed
that
worries
you
and
this
church
of
i
feel
as
though
i
had
been
struggling
to
this
talk
through
all
the
years
since
my
doubts
the
story
your
creed
is
trying
to
tell
is
much
the
same
story
that
all
religions
try
to
tell
in
your
heart
there
is
god
beyond
the
stars
there
is
god
is
it
the
same
god
i
do
know
said
the
bishop
does
any
one
know
i
thought
i
your
creed
is
full
of
levantine
phrases
and
images
full
of
the
patched
contradictions
of
the
human
intelligence
utterly
puzzled
it
is
about
those
two
gods
the
god
beyond
the
stars
and
the
god
in
your
heart
it
says
that
they
are
the
same
god
but
different
it
says
that
they
have
existed
together
for
all
time
and
that
one
is
the
son
of
the
other
it
has
added
a
third
person
but
we
wo
go
into
the
bishop
was
reminded
suddenly
of
the
dispute
at
garstein
fellows
we
wo
go
into
that
he
agreed
no
other
religions
have
told
the
story
in
a
different
way
the
cathars
and
gnostics
did
they
said
that
the
god
in
your
heart
is
a
rebel
against
the
god
beyond
the
stars
that
the
christ
in
your
heart
is
like
prometheus
or
hiawatha
or
any
other
of
the
sacrificial
gods
a
rebel
he
arises
out
of
man
he
rebels
against
that
high
god
of
the
stars
and
crystals
and
poisons
and
monsters
and
of
the
dead
emptiness
of
space
the
manicheans
and
the
persians
made
out
our
god
to
be
fighting
eternally
against
that
being
of
silence
and
darkness
beyond
the
stars
the
buddhists
made
the
lord
buddha
the
leader
of
men
out
of
the
futility
and
confusion
of
material
existence
to
the
great
peace
beyond
but
it
is
all
one
story
really
the
story
of
the
two
essential
beings
always
the
same
story
and
the
same
perplexity
cropping
up
under
different
names
the
story
of
one
being
who
stirs
us
calls
to
us
and
leads
us
and
of
another
who
is
above
and
outside
and
in
and
beneath
all
things
inaccessible
and
incomprehensible
all
these
religions
are
trying
to
tell
something
they
do
not
clearly
know
of
a
relationship
between
these
two
that
eludes
them
that
eludes
the
human
mind
as
water
escapes
from
the
hand
it
is
unity
and
opposition
they
have
to
declare
at
the
same
time
it
is
agreement
and
propitiation
it
is
infinity
and
and
the
truth
said
the
bishop
in
an
eager
whisper
you
can
tell
me
the
the
angel
answer
was
a
gross
familiarity
he
thrust
his
hand
through
the
bishop
hair
and
ruffled
it
affectionately
and
rested
for
a
moment
holding
the
bishop
cranium
in
his
great
palm
but
can
this
hold
it
he
said
not
with
this
little
box
of
brains
said
the
angel
you
could
as
soon
make
a
meal
of
the
stars
and
pack
them
into
your
belly
you
have
the
things
to
do
it
with
inside
he
gave
the
bishop
head
a
little
shake
and
relinquished
it
he
began
to
argue
as
an
elder
brother
might
is
it
enough
for
you
to
know
something
of
the
god
that
comes
down
to
the
human
scale
who
has
been
born
on
your
planet
and
arisen
out
of
man
who
is
man
and
god
your
leader
he
more
than
enough
to
fill
your
mind
and
use
up
every
faculty
of
your
being
he
is
courage
he
is
adventure
he
is
the
king
he
fights
for
you
and
with
you
against
death
and
he
is
not
infinite
he
is
not
the
creator
asked
the
bishop
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
no
said
the
angel
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
what
have
you
to
do
with
creation
and
at
that
question
it
seemed
that
a
great
hand
swept
carelessly
across
the
blackness
of
the
farther
sky
and
smeared
it
with
stars
and
suns
and
shining
nebulas
as
a
brush
might
smear
dry
paint
across
a
canvas
the
bishop
stared
in
front
of
him
then
slowly
he
bowed
his
head
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
i
have
been
in
orders
he
murmured
i
have
been
teaching
people
the
only
orthodox
and
perfect
truth
about
these
things
for
seven
and
twenty
and
suddenly
he
was
back
in
his
gaiters
and
his
apron
and
his
shovel
hat
a
little
black
figure
exceedingly
small
in
a
very
great
space
it
was
a
very
great
space
indeed
because
it
was
all
space
and
the
roof
was
the
ebony
of
limitless
space
from
which
the
stars
swung
flaming
held
by
invisible
ties
and
the
soil
beneath
his
feet
was
a
dust
of
atoms
and
the
little
beginnings
of
life
and
long
before
the
bishop
bared
his
face
again
he
knew
that
he
was
to
see
his
god
he
looked
up
slowly
fearing
to
be
dazzled
but
he
was
not
dazzled
he
knew
that
he
saw
only
the
likeness
and
bodying
forth
of
a
being
inconceivable
of
one
who
is
greater
than
the
earth
and
stars
and
yet
no
greater
than
a
man
he
saw
a
being
for
ever
young
for
ever
beginning
for
ever
triumphant
the
quality
and
texture
of
this
being
was
a
warm
and
living
light
like
the
effulgence
at
sunrise
he
was
hope
and
courage
like
a
sunlit
morning
in
spring
he
was
adventure
for
ever
and
his
courage
and
adventure
flowed
into
and
submerged
and
possessed
the
being
of
the
man
who
beheld
him
and
this
presence
of
god
stood
over
the
bishop
and
seemed
to
speak
to
him
in
a
wordless
speech
he
bade
him
surrender
himself
he
bade
him
come
out
upon
the
adventure
of
life
the
great
adventure
of
the
earth
that
will
make
the
atoms
our
and
subdue
the
stars
that
will
build
up
the
white
fires
of
ecstasy
to
submerge
pain
for
ever
that
will
overcome
death
in
him
the
spirit
of
creation
had
become
incarnate
had
joined
itself
to
men
summoning
men
to
him
having
need
of
them
having
need
of
them
having
need
of
their
service
even
as
great
kings
and
generals
and
leaders
need
and
use
men
for
a
moment
for
an
endless
age
the
bishop
bowed
himself
in
the
being
and
glory
of
god
felt
the
glow
of
the
divine
courage
and
confidence
in
his
marrow
felt
himself
one
with
god
for
a
timeless
interval
never
had
the
bishop
had
so
intense
a
sense
of
reality
it
seemed
that
never
before
had
he
known
anything
real
he
knew
certainly
that
god
was
his
king
and
master
and
that
his
unworthy
service
could
be
acceptable
to
god
his
mind
embraced
that
idea
with
an
absolute
conviction
that
was
also
absolute
happiness
the
thoughts
and
sensations
of
the
bishop
seemed
to
have
lifted
for
a
time
clean
away
from
the
condition
of
time
and
then
through
a
vast
orbit
to
be
returning
to
that
limitation
he
was
aware
presently
that
things
were
changing
that
the
light
was
losing
its
diviner
rays
that
in
some
indescribable
manner
the
glory
and
the
assurance
diminished
the
onset
of
the
new
phase
was
by
imperceptible
degrees
from
a
glowing
serene
and
static
realization
of
god
everything
relapsed
towards
change
and
activity
he
was
in
time
again
and
things
were
happening
it
was
as
if
the
quicksands
of
time
poured
by
him
and
it
was
as
if
god
was
passing
away
from
him
he
fell
swiftly
down
from
the
heaven
of
to
a
grotesque
pathetic
and
earthly
he
became
acutely
aware
of
his
episcopal
livery
and
that
god
was
passing
away
from
him
it
was
as
if
god
was
passing
and
as
if
the
bishop
was
unable
to
rise
up
and
follow
him
then
it
was
as
if
god
had
passed
and
as
if
the
bishop
was
in
headlong
pursuit
of
him
and
in
a
great
terror
lest
he
should
be
left
behind
and
he
was
surely
being
left
behind
he
discovered
that
in
some
unaccountable
way
his
gaiters
were
loose
most
of
their
buttons
seemed
to
have
flown
off
and
his
episcopal
sash
had
slipped
down
about
his
feet
he
was
sorely
impeded
he
kept
snatching
at
these
things
as
he
ran
in
clumsy
attempts
to
get
them
off
at
last
he
had
to
stop
altogether
and
kneel
down
and
fumble
with
the
last
obstinate
button
oh
god
he
cried
god
my
captain
wait
for
me
be
patient
with
me
and
as
he
did
so
god
turned
back
and
reached
out
his
hand
it
was
indeed
as
if
he
stood
and
smiled
he
stood
and
smiled
as
a
kind
man
might
do
he
dazzled
and
blinded
his
worshipper
and
yet
it
was
manifest
that
he
had
a
hand
a
man
might
clasp
unspeakable
love
and
joy
irradiated
the
whole
being
of
the
bishop
as
he
seized
god
hand
and
clasped
it
desperately
with
both
his
own
it
was
as
if
his
nerves
and
arteries
and
all
his
substance
were
inundated
with
golden
light
it
was
again
as
if
he
merged
with
god
and
became
god
chapter
the
sixth
exegetical
without
any
sense
of
transition
the
bishop
found
himself
seated
in
the
little
north
library
of
the
athenaeum
club
and
staring
at
the
bust
of
john
wilson
croker
he
was
sitting
motionless
and
musing
deeply
he
was
questioning
with
a
cool
and
steady
mind
whether
he
had
seen
a
vision
or
whether
he
had
had
a
dream
if
it
had
been
a
dream
it
had
been
an
extraordinarily
vivid
and
convincing
dream
he
still
seemed
to
be
in
the
presence
of
god
and
it
perplexed
him
not
at
all
that
he
should
also
be
in
the
presence
of
croker
the
feeling
of
mental
rottenness
and
insecurity
that
had
weakened
his
thought
through
the
period
of
his
illness
had
gone
he
was
secure
again
within
himself
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
fundamentally
whether
it
was
an
experience
of
things
without
or
of
things
within
him
that
had
happened
to
him
it
was
clear
to
him
that
much
that
he
had
seen
was
at
most
expressive
that
some
was
altogether
symbolical
for
example
there
was
that
sudden
absurd
realization
of
his
sash
and
gaiters
and
his
perception
of
them
as
encumbrances
in
his
pursuit
of
god
but
the
setting
and
essential
of
the
whole
thing
remained
in
his
mind
neither
expressive
nor
symbolical
but
as
real
and
immediately
perceived
and
that
was
the
presence
and
kingship
of
god
god
was
still
with
him
and
about
him
and
over
him
and
sustaining
him
he
was
back
again
in
his
world
and
his
ordinary
life
in
his
clothing
and
his
body
and
his
club
but
god
had
been
made
and
remained
altogether
plain
and
manifest
whether
an
actual
vision
had
made
his
conviction
or
whether
the
conviction
of
his
own
subconscious
mind
had
made
the
dream
seemed
but
a
small
matter
beside
the
conviction
that
this
was
indeed
the
god
he
had
desired
and
the
god
who
must
rule
his
life
the
stuff
the
stuff
had
little
to
do
with
it
it
just
cleared
my
head
i
have
seen
i
have
seen
really
i
for
a
long
time
as
it
seemed
the
bishop
remained
wrapped
in
clouds
of
luminous
meditation
dream
or
vision
it
did
not
matter
the
essential
thing
was
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
god
he
had
found
god
moreover
he
perceived
that
his
theological
perplexities
had
gone
god
was
higher
and
simpler
and
nearer
than
any
theological
god
than
the
god
of
the
three
creeds
those
creeds
lay
about
in
his
mind
now
like
garments
flung
aside
no
trace
nor
suspicion
of
divinity
sustained
them
any
longer
and
now
now
he
would
go
out
into
the
world
the
little
library
of
the
athenaeum
has
no
visible
door
he
went
to
the
entrance
in
the
corner
and
felt
among
the
bookshelves
for
the
hidden
latch
then
he
paused
held
by
a
curious
thought
what
exactly
was
the
intention
of
that
symbolical
struggle
with
his
sash
and
gaiters
and
why
had
they
impeded
his
pursuit
of
god
to
what
particularly
significant
action
was
he
going
out
the
three
creeds
were
like
garments
flung
aside
but
he
was
still
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
priest
in
the
service
of
those
three
creeds
after
a
long
interval
he
walked
into
the
big
he
ordered
some
tea
and
dry
toast
and
butter
and
sat
down
very
thoughtfully
in
a
corner
he
was
still
sitting
and
thinking
at
eight
it
may
seem
strange
to
the
reader
that
this
bishop
who
had
been
doubting
and
criticizing
the
church
and
his
system
of
beliefs
for
four
long
years
had
never
before
faced
the
possibility
of
a
severance
from
his
ecclesiastical
dignity
but
he
had
grown
up
in
the
church
his
life
had
been
so
entirely
clerical
and
anglican
that
the
widest
separation
he
had
hitherto
been
able
to
imagine
from
this
past
had
left
him
still
a
bishop
heretical
perhaps
innovating
in
the
broadening
of
beliefs
and
the
liberalizing
of
practice
defensive
even
as
chasters
was
defensive
but
still
with
the
palace
and
his
dignities
differing
in
opinion
rather
than
in
any
tangible
reality
from
his
previous
self
for
a
bishop
disbelief
in
the
church
is
a
far
profounder
scepticism
than
mere
disbelief
in
god
god
is
unseen
and
in
daily
things
unfelt
but
the
church
is
with
the
predestined
bishop
always
his
concept
of
the
extremest
possible
departure
from
orthodoxy
had
been
something
that
chasters
had
phrased
as
a
restatement
of
it
was
a
new
idea
an
idea
that
had
come
with
an
immense
effect
of
severance
and
novelty
that
god
could
be
other
than
the
god
of
the
creed
could
present
himself
to
the
imagination
as
a
figure
totally
unlike
the
white
gentle
and
compromising
redeemer
of
an
anglican
thought
that
the
bishop
should
treat
the
whole
teaching
of
the
church
and
the
church
itself
as
wrong
was
an
idea
so
new
that
it
fell
upon
him
now
like
a
thunderbolt
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
but
here
clear
in
his
mind
now
was
a
feeling
amounting
to
conviction
that
it
was
the
purpose
and
gesture
of
the
true
god
that
he
should
come
right
out
of
the
church
and
all
his
professions
and
in
the
first
glow
of
his
vision
he
felt
this
gesture
imperative
he
must
step
right
out
whither
how
and
when
to
begin
with
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
immediate
renunciation
was
demanded
but
it
was
a
momentous
step
he
wanted
to
think
and
to
go
on
thinking
rather
than
to
act
precipitately
although
the
imperative
seemed
absolute
some
delaying
and
arresting
instinct
insisted
that
he
must
think
if
he
went
back
to
princhester
the
everyday
duties
of
his
position
would
confront
him
at
once
with
an
effect
of
a
definite
challenge
he
decided
to
take
one
of
the
reform
club
bedrooms
for
two
or
three
days
and
wire
to
princhester
that
he
was
unavoidably
delayed
in
town
without
further
explanations
then
perhaps
this
inhibitory
force
would
give
way
it
did
not
however
give
way
his
mind
sat
down
for
two
days
in
a
blank
amazement
at
the
course
before
him
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
this
reasonless
and
formless
institution
was
as
strong
as
ever
during
that
time
except
for
some
incidental
exchanges
at
his
clubs
he
talked
to
no
one
at
first
he
did
not
want
to
talk
to
any
one
he
remained
mentally
and
practically
active
with
a
still
intensely
vivid
sense
that
god
the
true
god
stood
watching
him
and
waiting
for
him
to
follow
and
to
follow
meant
slipping
right
out
of
all
the
world
he
had
ever
known
to
thrust
his
foot
right
over
the
edge
of
a
cliff
would
scarcely
have
demanded
more
from
the
bishop
store
of
resolution
he
stood
on
the
very
verge
the
chief
secretion
of
his
mind
was
a
shadowy
experiment
or
so
in
explanation
of
why
he
did
not
follow
insensibly
the
extreme
vividness
of
his
sense
of
god
nearness
decreased
but
he
still
retained
a
persuasion
of
the
reality
of
an
immediate
listener
waiting
and
of
the
need
of
satisfying
him
on
the
third
day
he
found
his
mind
still
further
changed
he
no
longer
felt
that
god
was
in
pall
mall
or
james
park
whither
he
resorted
to
walk
and
muse
he
felt
now
that
god
was
somewhere
about
the
horizon
he
felt
too
no
longer
that
he
thought
straight
into
the
mind
of
god
he
thought
now
of
what
he
would
presently
say
to
god
he
turned
over
and
rehearsed
phrases
with
that
came
a
desire
to
try
them
first
on
some
other
hearer
and
from
that
to
the
attentive
head
of
lady
sunderbund
prettily
bent
towards
him
was
no
great
leap
she
would
understand
if
any
one
could
understand
the
great
change
that
had
happened
in
his
mind
he
found
her
address
in
the
telephone
book
she
could
be
quite
alone
to
him
if
he
would
mind
just
it
was
he
said
exactly
what
he
desired
but
when
he
got
to
her
great
airy
flat
overlooking
hyde
park
with
its
omega
workshop
furniture
and
its
arresting
decoration
he
was
not
so
sure
whether
this
encounter
was
so
exactly
the
thing
he
had
desired
as
he
had
supposed
the
world
had
become
opaque
and
real
again
as
he
walked
up
street
and
past
the
ritz
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
taking
an
afternoon
off
from
god
the
adventurous
modernity
of
the
room
in
which
he
waited
intensified
that
one
whole
white
wall
was
devoted
to
a
small
picture
by
wyndham
lewis
it
was
like
a
picture
of
an
earthquake
in
a
city
of
aniline
pink
and
grey
and
keen
green
cardboard
and
he
wished
it
had
never
existed
he
turned
his
back
upon
it
and
stared
out
of
the
window
over
the
trees
and
greenery
the
balcony
was
decorated
with
white
and
pink
geraniums
in
pots
painted
black
and
gold
and
the
railings
of
the
balcony
were
black
and
gold
with
crimson
shape
like
squares
wildly
out
of
drawing
lady
sunderbund
kept
him
waiting
perhaps
five
minutes
then
she
came
sailing
in
to
him
she
was
dressed
in
a
way
and
moved
across
the
room
in
a
way
that
was
more
reminiscent
of
botticelli
spring
than
ever
only
with
a
kind
of
superadded
stiffish
polonaise
of
lace
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
reminded
of
botticelli
spring
or
wonder
why
she
had
taken
to
stiff
lace
polonaises
he
did
not
enquire
whether
he
had
met
lady
sunderbund
to
better
advantage
at
garstein
fellows
or
whether
his
memory
had
overrated
her
or
whether
anything
had
happened
to
his
standard
of
taste
but
his
feeling
now
was
decidedly
one
of
disappointment
and
all
the
talk
and
he
had
promised
himself
seemed
to
wither
and
hide
away
within
him
for
a
time
he
talked
of
her
view
and
then
admired
her
room
and
its
arrangement
which
he
thought
really
were
quite
unbecomingly
flippant
and
undignified
for
a
room
then
came
the
black
on
their
orange
tray
and
he
searched
in
his
mind
for
small
talk
to
sustain
their
interview
but
he
had
already
betrayed
his
disposition
to
go
on
with
our
talk
in
his
telephone
enquiry
and
lady
sunderbund
perceiving
his
shyness
began
to
make
openings
for
him
at
first
just
little
hinting
openings
and
then
larger
and
larger
ones
until
at
last
one
got
him
i
so
glad
she
said
to
see
you
again
i
so
glad
to
go
on
with
our
talk
i
thought
about
it
and
thought
about
she
beamed
at
him
happily
i
thought
ova
wo
you
said
she
went
on
when
she
had
finished
conveying
her
pretty
bliss
to
him
i
been
so
helped
by
thinking
the
are
symbols
and
all
you
said
and
i
felt
time
after
time
you
could
stay
whe
you
we
that
what
you
we
saying
to
me
would
have
to
be
said
that
brought
him
in
he
could
not
very
well
evade
that
opening
without
incivility
after
all
he
had
asked
to
see
her
and
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
let
little
decorative
accidentals
put
him
off
his
friendly
purpose
a
woman
may
have
painted
gold
with
black
checkers
and
still
be
deeply
understanding
he
determined
to
tell
her
what
was
in
his
mind
but
he
found
something
barred
him
from
telling
that
he
had
had
an
actual
vision
of
god
it
was
as
if
that
had
been
a
private
and
confidential
meeting
it
was
he
felt
for
him
either
to
boast
a
privilege
or
tell
others
of
things
that
god
had
not
chosen
to
show
them
since
i
saw
you
he
said
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
of
the
subject
of
our
i
have
been
to
think
she
said
in
a
confirmatory
tone
as
if
she
had
my
faith
in
god
grows
he
said
she
glowed
her
lips
fell
apart
she
flamed
attention
but
it
grows
less
like
the
faith
of
the
church
less
and
less
i
was
born
and
trained
in
anglicanism
and
it
is
with
a
sort
of
astonishment
i
find
myself
passing
now
out
of
every
sort
of
catholicism
seeing
it
from
the
outside
just
as
one
might
see
buddhism
she
supplied
and
yet
feeling
nearer
infinitely
nearer
to
god
he
said
yes
she
panted
i
thought
if
one
went
out
one
went
out
just
to
doubt
and
and
you
do
you
have
gone
at
one
step
to
a
new
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
phrase
to
religion
he
said
it
is
so
wondyful
she
said
with
her
hands
straight
down
upon
the
couch
upon
which
she
was
sitting
and
leaning
forward
at
him
so
as
to
seem
almost
as
much
out
of
drawing
as
a
modern
picture
it
seems
he
reflected
as
if
it
were
a
natural
she
came
back
to
earth
very
slowly
she
turned
to
the
with
hushed
and
solemn
movements
as
though
she
administered
a
ceremony
of
peculiar
significance
the
bishop
too
rose
slowly
out
of
the
profundity
of
his
confession
no
sugar
please
he
said
arresting
the
lump
in
mid
air
it
was
only
when
they
were
embarked
upon
cups
of
tea
and
had
a
little
refreshed
themselves
that
she
carried
the
talk
further
does
it
mean
that
you
must
leave
the
church
she
asked
it
seemed
so
at
first
he
said
but
now
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
what
i
ought
to
she
awaited
his
next
thought
it
is
as
if
one
had
lived
in
a
room
all
one
life
and
thought
it
the
world
and
then
suddenly
walked
out
through
a
door
and
discovered
the
sea
and
the
mountains
and
stars
so
it
was
with
me
and
the
anglican
church
it
seems
so
extraordinary
now
and
it
would
have
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
a
year
ago
to
think
that
i
ever
believed
that
the
anglican
compromise
was
the
final
truth
of
religion
that
nothing
more
until
the
end
of
the
world
could
ever
be
known
that
cosmo
gordon
lang
did
not
know
that
there
could
be
no
conception
of
god
and
his
quality
that
randall
davidson
did
not
he
paused
i
did
he
said
i
did
she
responded
with
round
blue
eyes
of
wonder
at
the
utmost
the
church
of
england
is
a
tabernacle
on
a
a
that
goes
whe
she
rhetorized
exactly
said
the
bishop
and
put
down
his
cup
you
see
my
dear
lady
sunderbund
he
resumed
i
am
exactly
in
the
same
position
of
that
man
at
the
she
quoted
aptly
and
softly
the
was
all
befo
them
whe
to
he
was
struck
by
the
aptness
of
the
words
i
feel
i
have
to
come
right
out
into
the
bare
truth
what
exactly
then
do
i
become
do
i
lose
my
priestly
function
because
i
discover
how
great
god
is
but
what
am
i
to
do
he
opened
a
new
layer
of
his
thoughts
to
her
there
is
a
saying
he
remarked
once
a
priest
always
a
priest
i
can
not
imagine
myself
as
other
than
what
i
but
no
maw
she
said
orthodox
no
longer
a
priest
who
seeks
an
exploring
in
a
of
and
she
carried
him
on
at
any
rate
in
a
progressive
and
learning
she
flashed
and
glowed
assent
i
have
been
haunted
he
said
by
those
words
spoken
at
athens
therefore
ye
ignorantly
worship
him
declare
i
unto
you
that
comes
to
me
with
an
effect
of
guidance
is
an
word
shall
i
say
suggestion
to
stand
by
the
altar
bearing
strange
names
and
ancient
symbols
speaking
plainly
to
all
mankind
of
the
one
true
god
he
did
not
get
much
beyond
this
point
at
the
time
though
he
remained
talking
with
lady
sunderbund
for
nearly
an
hour
longer
the
rest
was
merely
a
beating
out
of
what
had
already
been
said
but
insensibly
she
renewed
her
original
charm
and
as
he
became
accustomed
to
her
he
forgot
a
certain
artificiality
in
her
manner
and
the
extreme
modernity
of
her
costume
and
furniture
she
was
a
wonderful
listener
nobody
else
could
have
helped
him
to
expression
in
quite
the
same
way
and
when
he
left
her
he
felt
that
now
he
was
capable
of
stating
his
case
in
a
coherent
and
acceptable
form
to
almost
any
intelligent
hearer
he
had
a
point
of
view
now
that
was
no
longer
embarrassed
by
the
immediate
golden
presence
of
god
he
was
no
longer
dazzled
nor
ecstatic
his
problem
had
diminished
to
the
scale
of
any
other
great
human
problem
to
the
scale
of
political
problems
and
problems
of
integrity
and
moral
principle
problems
about
which
there
is
no
such
urgency
as
there
is
about
a
house
on
fire
for
example
and
now
the
desire
for
expression
was
running
strong
he
wanted
to
state
his
situation
if
he
did
not
state
he
would
have
to
act
and
as
he
walked
back
to
the
club
dinner
he
turned
over
possible
interlocutors
in
his
thoughts
lord
rampound
sat
with
him
at
dinner
and
he
came
near
broaching
the
subject
with
him
but
lord
rampound
that
evening
had
that
morbid
running
of
bluish
legal
anecdotes
which
is
so
common
an
affliction
with
lawyers
and
theology
sinks
and
dies
in
that
turbid
stream
but
as
he
lay
in
bed
that
night
he
thought
of
his
old
friend
and
helper
bishop
likeman
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
he
should
consult
him
and
this
he
did
next
day
since
the
days
when
the
bishop
had
been
only
plain
scrope
the
youngest
and
most
helpful
of
likeman
historical
band
of
curates
their
friendship
had
continued
likeman
had
been
a
second
father
to
him
in
particular
his
tact
and
helpfulness
had
shone
during
those
days
of
doubt
and
anxiety
when
dear
old
queen
victoria
god
representative
on
earth
had
obstinately
refused
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
make
him
a
bishop
she
had
those
pigheaded
fits
and
she
was
touchy
about
the
bishops
she
had
liked
scrope
on
account
of
the
excellence
of
his
german
pronunciation
but
she
had
been
irritated
by
newspaper
paragraphs
nobody
could
ever
find
out
who
wrote
them
and
nobody
could
ever
find
out
who
showed
them
to
the
old
lady
anticipating
his
elevation
she
had
gone
very
red
in
the
face
and
stiffened
in
the
guelphic
manner
whenever
scrope
was
mentioned
and
so
a
rich
harvest
of
spiritual
life
had
remained
untilled
for
some
months
likeman
had
brought
her
round
it
seemed
arguable
that
scrope
owed
some
explanation
to
likeman
before
he
came
to
any
open
breach
with
the
establishment
he
found
likeman
perceptibly
older
and
more
shrivelled
on
account
of
the
war
but
still
as
sweet
and
lucid
and
subtle
as
ever
his
voice
sounded
more
than
ever
like
a
kind
old
woman
he
sat
buried
in
his
cushions
for
nowadays
i
must
save
every
scrap
of
vitality
and
for
a
time
contented
himself
with
drawing
out
his
visitor
story
of
course
one
does
not
talk
to
likeman
of
visions
or
intuitions
i
am
disturbed
i
find
myself
getting
out
of
touch
that
was
the
tone
occasionally
likeman
nodded
slowly
as
a
physician
might
do
at
the
recital
of
familiar
symptoms
yes
he
said
i
have
been
through
most
of
this
a
little
different
in
the
inessentials
how
clear
you
are
you
leave
our
stupid
old
trinities
as
i
left
them
long
ago
said
old
likeman
with
his
lean
hand
feeling
and
clawing
at
the
arm
of
his
chair
but
the
old
man
raised
his
hand
and
dropped
it
you
go
away
from
it
all
straight
as
a
line
i
did
you
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
fly
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
and
there
you
find
he
held
up
a
lean
finger
and
inclined
it
to
tick
off
each
point
fate
which
is
god
the
father
the
power
of
the
heart
which
is
god
the
son
and
that
light
which
comes
in
upon
us
from
the
inaccessible
godhead
which
is
god
the
holy
but
i
know
of
no
god
the
holy
spirit
and
fate
is
not
god
at
all
i
saw
in
my
vision
one
sole
god
uncrucified
militant
conquering
and
to
old
likeman
stared
you
saw
the
bishop
of
princhester
had
not
meant
to
go
so
far
but
he
stuck
to
his
words
as
if
i
saw
with
my
eyes
a
god
of
light
and
you
have
had
visions
scrope
i
seemed
to
no
you
have
just
been
dreaming
but
why
should
one
not
see
see
the
things
of
the
spirit
these
symbols
as
realities
these
metaphors
as
men
walking
you
talk
like
an
we
are
all
agnostics
our
creeds
are
expressions
of
ourselves
and
our
attitude
and
relationship
to
the
unknown
the
triune
god
is
just
the
form
of
our
need
and
disposition
i
have
always
assumed
that
you
took
that
for
granted
who
has
ever
really
seen
or
heard
or
felt
god
god
is
neither
of
the
senses
nor
of
the
mind
he
is
of
the
soul
you
are
realistic
you
are
materialistic
his
voice
expostulated
the
bishop
of
princhester
reflected
the
vision
of
god
was
far
off
among
his
memories
now
and
difficult
to
recall
but
he
said
at
last
i
believe
there
is
a
god
and
that
he
is
as
real
a
person
as
you
or
i
and
he
is
not
the
theological
god
we
set
out
before
the
personification
said
likeman
in
the
eighteenth
century
they
used
to
draw
beautiful
female
figures
as
science
and
mathematics
young
men
have
loved
science
and
freedom
as
pygmalion
loved
galatea
have
it
so
if
you
will
have
a
visible
person
for
your
deity
but
let
me
keep
up
my
your
spirituality
seems
as
thin
as
a
mist
do
you
really
believe
anything
everything
said
likeman
emphatically
sitting
up
with
a
transitory
vigour
everything
we
two
have
ever
professed
together
i
believe
that
the
creeds
of
my
church
do
express
all
that
can
possibly
be
expressed
in
the
relationship
of
that
he
made
a
comprehensive
gesture
with
a
twist
of
his
hand
upon
its
wrist
to
the
human
soul
i
believe
that
they
express
it
as
well
as
the
human
mind
can
express
it
where
they
seem
to
be
contradictory
or
absurd
it
is
merely
that
the
mystery
is
paradoxical
i
believe
that
the
story
of
the
fall
and
of
the
redemption
is
a
complete
symbol
that
to
add
to
it
or
to
subtract
from
it
or
to
alter
it
is
to
diminish
its
truth
if
it
seems
incredible
at
this
point
or
that
then
simply
i
admit
my
own
mental
defect
and
i
believe
in
our
church
scrope
as
the
embodied
truth
of
religion
the
divine
instrument
in
human
affairs
i
believe
in
the
security
of
its
tradition
in
the
complete
and
entire
soundness
of
its
teaching
in
its
essential
authority
and
he
paused
and
put
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
smiled
sweetly
and
now
can
you
say
i
do
not
believe
but
the
historical
christ
the
man
jesus
a
life
may
be
a
metaphor
why
not
yes
i
believe
it
all
the
bishop
of
princhester
was
staggered
by
this
complete
acceptance
i
see
you
believe
all
you
profess
he
said
and
remained
for
a
moment
or
so
rallying
his
forces
your
vision
if
it
was
a
vision
i
put
it
to
you
was
just
some
single
aspect
of
divinity
said
likeman
we
make
a
mistake
in
supposing
that
heresy
has
no
truth
in
it
most
heresies
are
only
a
disproportionate
apprehension
of
some
essential
truth
most
heretics
are
men
who
have
suddenly
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
veil
of
some
particular
verity
they
are
dazzled
by
that
aspect
all
the
rest
has
vanished
they
are
obsessed
you
are
obsessed
clearly
by
this
discovery
of
the
militancy
of
god
god
the
son
as
hero
and
you
want
to
go
out
to
the
simple
worship
of
that
one
aspect
you
want
to
go
out
to
a
dissenter
tent
in
the
wilderness
instead
of
staying
in
the
great
temple
of
the
was
that
true
for
some
moments
it
sounded
true
the
bishop
of
princhester
sat
frowning
and
looking
at
that
very
far
away
was
the
vision
now
of
that
golden
captain
who
bade
him
come
then
at
a
thought
the
bishop
smiled
the
great
temple
of
the
ages
he
repeated
but
do
you
remember
the
trouble
we
had
when
the
little
old
queen
was
so
pigheaded
oh
i
remember
i
remember
said
likeman
smiling
with
unshaken
confidence
why
not
for
sixty
years
all
we
bishops
in
what
you
call
the
great
temple
of
the
ages
were
appointed
and
bullied
and
kept
in
our
places
by
that
pink
irascible
bit
of
dignity
i
remember
how
at
the
time
i
did
dare
betray
my
boiling
indignation
even
to
you
i
scarcely
dared
admit
it
to
myself
he
paused
it
does
matter
at
all
and
old
likeman
waved
it
aside
not
at
all
he
confirmed
waving
again
i
spoke
of
the
whole
church
of
christ
on
earth
he
went
on
these
things
these
victorias
and
edwards
and
so
on
are
temporary
accidents
just
as
the
severance
of
an
anglican
from
a
roman
communion
and
a
greek
orthodox
communion
are
temporary
accidents
you
will
remark
that
wise
men
in
all
ages
have
been
able
to
surmount
the
difficulty
of
these
things
why
because
they
knew
that
in
spite
of
all
these
splits
and
irregularities
and
defacements
like
the
cracks
and
crannies
and
lichens
on
a
cathedral
wall
the
building
held
good
that
it
was
shelter
and
security
there
is
no
other
shelter
and
security
and
so
i
come
to
your
problem
suppose
it
is
true
that
you
have
this
incidental
vision
of
the
militant
aspect
of
god
and
he
is
as
you
see
him
now
that
is
he
is
like
the
trinity
he
is
like
the
creed
he
does
seem
to
be
related
to
the
church
then
comes
the
question
are
you
going
out
for
that
and
whither
do
you
go
if
you
do
go
out
the
church
remains
we
alter
doctrines
not
by
changing
the
words
but
by
shifting
the
accent
we
can
below
the
threshold
of
but
can
we
we
do
where
hell
now
eighty
years
ago
it
warmed
the
whole
church
it
was
as
some
atheist
or
other
put
it
the
other
day
the
central
heating
of
the
soul
but
never
mind
that
point
now
consider
the
essential
question
the
question
of
breaking
with
the
church
ask
yourself
whither
would
you
go
to
become
an
oddity
a
dissenter
a
negative
self
emasculated
the
spirit
that
denies
you
would
just
go
out
you
would
just
cease
to
serve
religion
that
would
be
all
you
would
do
anything
the
church
would
go
on
everything
else
would
go
on
only
you
would
be
lost
in
the
outer
wilderness
but
then
old
likeman
leant
forward
and
pointed
a
bony
finger
stay
in
the
church
and
modify
it
bring
this
new
light
of
yours
to
the
there
was
a
little
pause
no
man
the
bishop
thought
aloud
putteth
new
wine
into
old
old
likeman
began
to
speak
and
had
a
fit
of
coughing
some
of
these
texts
whuff
whuff
like
a
conjuror
hat
whuff
make
fit
a
appeared
and
handed
a
silver
box
of
lozenges
into
which
the
old
bishop
dipped
with
a
trembling
hand
tricks
of
that
sort
he
said
wo
do
scrope
among
professionals
and
besides
he
was
inspired
true
religion
is
old
wine
as
old
as
the
soul
you
are
a
bishop
in
the
church
of
christ
on
earth
he
summed
it
up
and
you
want
to
become
a
detached
and
wandering
ancient
mariner
from
your
shipwreck
of
faith
with
something
to
explain
that
nobody
wants
to
hear
you
are
going
out
i
suppose
you
have
means
the
old
man
awaited
the
answer
to
his
abrupt
enquiry
with
a
handful
of
lozenges
no
said
the
bishop
of
princhester
practically
i
my
dear
boy
it
was
as
if
they
were
once
more
rector
and
curate
my
dear
brother
do
you
know
what
the
value
of
an
is
in
the
ordinary
labour
market
i
have
never
thought
of
evidently
you
have
a
wife
and
children
five
and
your
wife
married
you
i
remember
she
married
you
soon
after
you
got
that
living
in
john
wood
i
suppose
she
took
it
for
granted
that
you
were
fixed
in
an
ecclesiastical
career
that
was
implicit
in
the
i
have
looked
very
much
at
that
side
of
the
matter
yet
said
the
bishop
of
princhester
it
should
be
a
decisive
factor
said
bishop
likeman
not
decisive
but
it
will
weigh
it
should
weigh
the
old
man
opened
out
fresh
aspects
of
the
case
his
argument
was
for
delay
for
deliberation
he
went
on
to
a
wider
set
of
considerations
a
man
who
has
held
the
position
of
a
bishop
for
some
years
is
he
held
no
longer
a
free
man
in
matters
of
opinion
he
has
become
an
official
part
of
a
great
edifice
which
supports
the
faith
of
multitudes
of
simple
and
dependant
believers
he
has
no
right
to
indulge
recklessly
in
intellectual
and
moral
integrities
he
may
understand
but
how
is
the
flock
to
understand
he
may
get
his
own
soul
clear
but
what
will
happen
to
them
he
will
just
break
away
their
supports
astonish
them
puzzle
them
distress
them
deprive
them
of
confidence
convince
them
of
nothing
intellectual
egotism
may
be
as
grave
a
sin
said
bishop
likeman
as
physical
selfishness
assuming
even
that
you
are
absolutely
right
said
bishop
likeman
are
you
still
rather
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
insists
upon
swedish
exercises
and
a
strengthening
dietary
on
a
raft
i
think
you
have
made
out
a
case
for
delay
said
his
hearer
three
the
bishop
of
princhester
conceded
three
months
including
every
sort
of
service
because
after
all
even
supposing
it
is
damnable
to
repeat
prayers
and
creeds
you
do
not
believe
in
and
administer
sacraments
you
think
superstition
nobody
can
be
damned
but
yourself
on
the
other
hand
if
you
express
doubts
that
are
not
yet
perfectly
digested
you
experiment
with
the
souls
of
others
the
bishop
found
much
to
ponder
in
his
old
friend
counsels
they
were
discursive
and
and
whenever
he
seemed
to
be
penetrating
or
defeating
the
particular
considerations
under
examination
the
others
in
the
background
had
a
way
of
appearing
invincible
he
had
a
strong
persuasion
that
likeman
was
wrong
and
unanswerable
and
the
true
god
now
was
no
more
than
the
memory
of
a
very
vividly
realized
idea
it
was
clear
to
the
bishop
that
he
was
no
longer
a
churchman
or
in
the
generally
accepted
sense
of
the
word
a
christian
and
that
he
was
bound
to
come
out
of
the
church
but
all
sense
of
urgency
had
gone
it
was
a
matter
demanding
deliberation
and
very
great
consideration
for
others
he
took
no
more
of
dale
stuff
because
he
felt
bodily
sound
and
slept
well
and
he
was
now
a
little
shy
of
this
potent
fluid
he
went
down
to
princhester
the
next
day
for
his
compromise
of
an
interval
of
three
months
made
it
seem
possible
to
face
his
episcopal
routine
again
it
was
only
when
he
was
back
in
his
own
palace
that
the
full
weight
of
his
domestic
responsibilities
in
the
discussion
of
the
course
he
had
to
take
became
apparent
lady
ella
met
him
with
affection
and
solicitude
i
was
tired
and
mentally
fagged
he
said
a
day
or
so
in
london
had
an
effect
of
she
agreed
that
he
looked
much
better
and
remained
for
a
moment
or
so
scrutinizing
him
with
the
faint
anxiety
of
one
resolved
to
be
completely
helpful
he
regarded
her
with
a
renewed
sense
of
her
grace
and
dignity
and
kindliness
she
was
wearing
a
grey
dress
of
soft
silky
material
touched
with
blue
and
covered
with
what
seemed
to
him
very
rich
and
beautiful
lace
her
hair
flowed
back
very
graciously
from
her
broad
brow
and
about
her
wrist
and
neck
were
delicate
lines
of
gold
she
seemed
tremendously
at
home
and
right
just
where
she
was
in
that
big
hospitable
room
cultured
but
anglican
without
pretensions
or
novelties
with
a
glow
of
bound
books
with
the
grand
piano
that
miriam
his
third
daughter
was
beginning
to
play
so
well
with
the
tea
equipage
of
shining
silver
and
fine
porcelain
he
sat
down
contentedly
in
the
low
armchair
beside
her
it
was
a
setting
that
one
would
rashly
destroy
and
that
evening
at
dinner
this
sense
of
his
home
as
a
complex
of
finely
adjusted
things
not
to
be
rashly
disturbed
was
still
more
in
the
mind
of
the
bishop
at
dinner
he
had
all
his
domesticities
about
him
it
was
the
family
time
from
eight
until
ten
at
which
latter
hour
he
would
usually
go
back
from
the
to
his
study
he
surveyed
the
table
eleanor
was
at
home
for
a
few
days
looking
a
little
thin
and
bright
but
very
keen
and
happy
she
had
taken
a
first
in
the
first
part
of
the
moral
science
tripos
and
she
was
working
hard
now
for
part
two
clementina
was
to
go
back
to
newnham
with
her
next
september
she
aspired
to
history
miriam
bent
was
musical
she
and
phoebe
and
daphne
and
clementina
were
under
the
care
of
skilful
mademoiselle
lafarge
most
tactful
of
protestant
protestant
and
yet
not
too
protestant
one
of
those
rare
french
protestants
in
whom
a
touch
of
bergson
and
the
pasteur
monod
scarce
suspected
animates
the
and
also
they
had
lessons
so
high
are
our
modern
standards
of
education
from
blent
a
brilliant
young
mathematician
in
orders
who
sat
now
next
to
lady
ella
whippham
the
chaplain
was
at
the
bishop
right
hand
ready
for
any
chance
of
making
arrangements
to
clear
off
the
small
arrears
of
duty
the
little
holiday
in
london
had
accumulated
the
bishop
surveyed
all
these
bright
young
people
between
himself
and
the
calm
beauty
of
his
wife
he
spoke
first
to
one
and
then
another
upon
the
things
that
interested
them
it
rejoiced
his
heart
to
be
able
to
give
them
education
and
opportunity
it
pleased
him
to
see
them
in
clothes
that
he
knew
were
none
the
less
expensive
because
of
their
complete
simplicity
miriam
and
blent
wrangled
pleasantly
about
debussy
and
old
dunk
waited
as
though
in
orders
of
some
rare
and
special
sort
that
qualified
him
for
this
service
all
these
people
the
bishop
reflected
counted
upon
him
that
this
would
go
on
eleanor
was
answering
some
question
of
her
mother
they
were
so
oddly
alike
and
so
curiously
different
and
both
in
their
several
ways
so
fine
eleanor
was
dark
like
his
own
mother
perhaps
she
did
a
little
lack
lady
ella
fine
reserves
she
could
express
more
she
could
feel
more
acutely
she
might
easily
be
very
unhappy
or
very
happy
all
these
people
counted
on
him
it
was
indeed
acutely
true
as
likeman
had
said
that
any
sudden
breach
with
his
position
would
be
a
breach
of
faith
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
and
just
then
his
eye
fell
upon
the
epergne
a
very
old
and
beautiful
piece
of
silver
that
graced
the
it
had
been
given
him
together
with
an
episcopal
ring
by
his
curates
and
choristers
at
the
church
of
the
holy
innocents
when
he
became
bishop
of
pinner
when
they
gave
it
him
had
any
one
of
them
dreamt
that
some
day
he
might
be
moved
to
strike
an
ungracious
blow
at
the
mother
church
that
had
reared
them
all
it
was
his
custom
to
join
the
family
in
the
after
dinner
he
was
a
little
delayed
by
whippham
with
some
trivialities
about
next
month
confirmations
in
pringle
and
princhester
when
he
came
in
he
found
miriam
playing
and
playing
very
beautifully
one
of
those
later
sonatas
of
beethoven
he
could
never
remember
whether
it
was
of
or
of
but
he
knew
that
he
liked
it
very
much
it
was
solemn
and
sombre
with
phases
of
indescribable
sweetness
while
clementina
daphne
and
mademoiselle
lafarge
went
on
with
their
war
knitting
and
phoebe
and
blent
bent
their
brows
over
chess
eleanor
was
reading
the
evening
paper
lady
ella
sat
on
a
high
chair
by
the
coffee
things
and
he
stood
in
the
doorway
surveying
the
peaceful
scene
for
a
moment
or
so
before
he
went
across
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
couch
close
to
her
you
look
tired
she
whispered
softly
that
chasters
case
things
developing
out
of
that
i
must
tell
you
it
would
be
he
felt
a
good
way
of
breaking
the
matter
to
her
is
the
chasters
case
coming
on
again
daddy
asked
eleanor
he
nodded
it
a
pity
she
said
what
that
he
ca
be
left
it
sir
reginald
phipps
the
church
would
be
much
more
tolerant
if
it
was
for
the
house
of
laymen
but
they
they
feel
they
must
do
he
seized
the
opportunity
of
the
music
ceasing
to
get
away
from
the
subject
miriam
dear
he
asked
raising
his
voice
is
that
or
i
can
never
that
is
always
daddy
said
miriam
it
the
other
one
is
and
then
evidently
feeling
that
she
had
been
pert
would
you
like
me
to
play
you
daddy
i
should
love
it
my
and
he
leant
back
and
prepared
to
listen
in
such
a
thorough
way
that
eleanor
would
have
no
chance
of
discussing
the
chasters
heresies
but
this
was
interrupted
by
the
consummation
of
the
coffee
and
blent
breaking
a
long
silence
with
mate
in
three
if
i
not
mistaken
leapt
to
his
feet
to
be
of
service
eleanor
with
the
rough
seriousness
of
youth
would
not
leave
the
chasters
case
alone
but
need
you
take
action
against
chasters
she
asked
at
once
it
a
very
complicated
subject
my
dear
he
said
his
arguments
the
practical
but
what
are
practical
considerations
in
such
a
case
that
a
subject
norah
her
father
said
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
but
began
eleanor
gathering
fresh
forces
daddy
is
tired
lady
ella
intervened
patting
him
on
the
head
oh
terribly
of
that
he
said
and
so
escaped
eleanor
for
the
evening
but
he
knew
that
before
very
long
he
would
have
to
tell
his
wife
of
the
changes
that
hung
over
their
lives
it
would
be
shabby
to
let
the
avalanche
fall
without
giving
the
longest
possible
warning
and
before
they
parted
that
night
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
said
there
is
much
i
have
to
tell
you
dear
things
change
the
whole
world
changes
the
church
must
not
live
in
a
dream
no
she
whispered
i
hope
you
will
sleep
and
held
up
her
grave
sweet
face
to
be
kissed
but
he
did
not
sleep
perfectly
that
night
he
did
not
sleep
indeed
very
badly
but
he
lay
for
some
time
thinking
thinking
not
onward
but
as
if
he
pressed
his
mind
against
very
strong
barriers
that
had
closed
again
his
vision
of
god
which
had
filled
the
heavens
had
become
now
a
minute
hard
conviction
in
his
mind
that
he
had
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
enormous
complications
of
symbolism
and
statement
and
organization
and
misunderstanding
in
the
church
and
achieve
again
a
simple
and
living
worship
of
a
simple
and
living
god
likeman
had
puzzled
and
silenced
him
only
upon
reflection
to
convince
him
that
amidst
such
intricacies
of
explanation
the
spirit
can
not
live
creeds
may
be
symbolical
but
symbols
must
not
prevaricate
a
church
that
can
symbolize
everything
and
anything
means
nothing
it
followed
from
this
that
he
ought
to
leave
the
church
but
there
came
the
other
side
of
this
perplexing
situation
his
feelings
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
were
exactly
like
those
one
has
in
a
dream
when
one
wishes
to
run
or
leap
or
shout
and
one
can
achieve
no
movement
no
sound
he
could
not
conceive
how
he
could
possibly
leave
the
church
his
wife
became
as
it
were
the
representative
of
all
that
held
him
helpless
she
and
he
had
never
kept
secret
from
one
another
any
plan
of
action
any
motive
that
affected
the
other
it
was
clear
to
him
that
any
movement
towards
the
disavowal
of
doctrinal
christianity
and
the
renunciation
of
his
see
must
be
first
discussed
with
her
he
must
tell
her
before
he
told
the
world
and
he
could
not
imagine
his
telling
her
except
as
an
incredibly
shattering
act
so
he
left
things
from
day
to
day
and
went
about
his
episcopal
routines
he
preached
and
delivered
addresses
in
such
phrases
as
he
knew
people
expected
and
wondered
profoundly
why
it
was
that
it
should
be
impossible
for
him
to
discuss
theological
points
with
lady
ella
and
one
afternoon
he
went
for
a
walk
with
eleanor
along
the
banks
of
the
prin
and
found
himself
in
response
to
certain
openings
of
hers
talking
to
her
in
almost
exactly
the
same
terms
as
likeman
had
used
to
him
then
suddenly
the
problem
of
this
theological
eclaircissement
was
complicated
in
an
unexpected
fashion
he
had
just
been
taking
his
every
second
thursday
talk
with
diocesan
men
helpers
he
had
been
trying
to
be
plain
and
simple
upon
the
needless
narrowness
of
enthusiastic
laymen
he
was
still
in
the
bishop
andrews
cap
and
purple
cassock
he
affected
on
these
occasions
the
men
helpers
loved
purple
and
he
was
disentangling
himself
from
two
or
three
resolute
bores
for
our
loyal
laymen
can
be
at
times
quite
superlative
bores
when
miriam
came
to
him
mummy
says
to
the
if
you
can
there
is
a
lady
sunderbund
who
seems
particularly
to
want
to
see
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
decided
that
this
was
a
conversation
he
ought
to
control
he
found
lady
sunderbund
looking
very
tall
and
radiantly
beautiful
in
a
sheathlike
dress
of
bright
crimson
trimmed
with
fur
and
a
white
fur
toque
she
held
out
a
long
hand
to
him
and
cried
in
a
tone
of
comradeship
and
profound
understanding
i
come
bishop
you
come
to
see
me
he
said
without
any
sincerity
in
his
polite
pleasure
i
come
to
to
stay
she
cried
with
a
bright
triumphant
rising
note
she
evidently
considered
lady
ella
a
mere
conversational
to
be
dropped
now
that
the
real
business
could
be
commenced
she
turned
her
pretty
profile
to
that
lady
and
obliged
the
bishop
with
a
compact
summary
of
all
that
had
preceded
his
arrival
i
have
been
telling
lady
ella
she
said
i
taken
a
house
and
all
hea
in
i
made
up
my
mind
to
sit
unda
you
as
they
say
in
clapham
i
come
down
he
fo
good
i
taken
a
little
house
oh
a
sweet
little
house
that
will
be
all
over
next
month
i
living
to
and
having
the
othas
done
up
it
in
that
little
quiet
behind
you
wall
and
he
i
am
is
it
the
old
doctor
house
asked
lady
ella
was
it
an
old
docta
cried
lady
sunderbund
how
delightful
and
now
i
shall
be
a
patient
she
concentrated
upon
the
bishop
oh
i
been
thinking
all
the
time
of
all
the
things
you
told
me
ova
and
ova
it
all
so
wondyful
and
so
so
like
a
daw
opening
new
light
as
if
it
was
all
just
she
clasped
her
hands
the
bishop
felt
that
there
were
a
great
number
of
points
to
this
situation
and
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
grasp
them
all
at
once
but
one
that
seemed
of
supreme
importance
to
his
whirling
intelligence
was
that
lady
ella
should
not
know
that
he
had
gone
to
relieve
his
soul
by
talking
to
lady
sunderbund
in
london
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
at
the
time
that
there
was
any
shadow
of
disloyalty
to
lady
ella
in
his
going
to
lady
sunderbund
but
now
he
realized
that
this
was
a
thing
that
would
annoy
lady
ella
extremely
the
conversation
had
in
the
first
place
to
be
kept
away
from
that
and
in
the
second
place
it
had
to
be
kept
away
from
the
abrupt
exploitation
of
the
new
theological
developments
he
felt
that
something
of
the
general
tension
would
be
relieved
if
they
could
all
three
be
got
to
sit
down
i
been
talking
for
just
upon
two
hours
he
said
to
lady
ella
good
to
see
the
water
boiling
for
he
put
a
chair
for
lady
sunderbund
to
the
right
of
lady
ella
got
her
into
it
by
infusing
an
ecclesiastical
insistence
into
his
manner
and
then
went
and
sat
upon
the
on
his
wife
left
so
as
to
establish
a
screen
of
and
cakes
and
so
forth
against
her
more
intimate
enthusiasm
meanwhile
he
began
to
see
his
way
clearer
and
to
develop
his
line
well
lady
sunderbund
he
said
i
can
assure
you
that
i
think
you
will
be
no
small
addition
to
the
church
life
of
princhester
but
i
warn
you
this
is
a
and
exacting
diocese
we
shall
take
your
money
all
we
can
get
of
it
we
shall
take
your
time
we
shall
work
you
me
hard
cried
lady
sunderbund
with
passion
we
will
we
will
said
the
bishop
in
a
tone
that
ignored
her
passionate
note
i
am
sure
lady
sunderbund
will
be
a
great
help
to
us
said
lady
ella
we
want
brightening
there
a
dinginess
lady
sunderbund
beamed
an
acknowledgment
i
shall
exact
a
she
said
i
do
mind
but
i
shall
like
the
poo
students
in
the
middle
ages
did
to
get
my
teaching
i
got
my
own
soul
to
save
as
well
as
help
saving
othas
since
oua
last
talk
she
found
the
bishop
handing
her
bread
and
butter
for
a
time
the
bishop
fought
a
delaying
action
with
the
while
he
sought
eagerly
and
vainly
in
his
mind
for
some
good
practical
topic
in
which
he
could
entangle
and
suppress
lady
sunderbund
enthusiasms
from
this
she
broke
away
by
turning
suddenly
to
lady
ella
youa
husband
views
she
said
a
to
me
it
was
like
not
being
blind
all
at
lady
ella
was
always
pleased
to
hear
her
husband
praised
her
colour
brightened
a
little
they
seem
very
ordinary
views
she
said
modestly
you
share
them
cried
lady
sunderbund
but
of
course
said
lady
ella
wondyful
cried
lady
sunderbund
tell
me
lady
sunderbund
said
the
bishop
are
you
going
to
alter
the
outer
appearance
of
the
old
doctor
house
and
found
that
at
last
he
had
discovered
the
saving
topic
at
all
she
said
i
shall
just
have
it
pointed
white
and
do
the
doa
i
not
su
how
i
shall
do
the
doa
whetha
i
shall
do
the
doa
gold
or
a
vehy
vehy
for
a
time
she
and
lady
ella
to
whom
these
ideas
were
novel
discussed
the
animation
of
grey
and
sombre
towns
by
house
painting
in
such
matter
lady
sunderbund
had
a
russian
mind
i
ca
bea
she
said
not
in
my
not
in
my
she
turned
to
the
bishop
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
paint
you
inside
and
they
used
to
be
painted
said
the
bishop
i
do
know
if
you
have
seen
ely
there
the
old
painting
has
been
largely
restored
from
that
to
the
end
there
was
no
real
danger
and
at
last
the
bishop
found
himself
alone
with
his
wife
again
remarkable
person
he
said
tentatively
i
never
met
any
one
whose
faults
were
more
visible
i
met
her
at
wimbush
he
glanced
at
his
watch
what
did
she
mean
asked
lady
ella
abruptly
by
talking
of
your
new
views
and
about
revelations
she
probably
misunderstood
something
i
said
at
the
garstein
fellows
he
said
she
has
rather
a
leaping
he
turned
to
the
window
looked
at
his
nails
and
appeared
to
be
suddenly
reminded
of
duties
elsewhere
it
was
chiefly
manifest
to
him
that
the
difficulties
in
explaining
the
changes
of
his
outlook
to
lady
ella
had
now
increased
enormously
a
day
or
so
after
lady
sunderbund
arrival
in
princhester
the
bishop
had
a
letter
from
likeman
the
old
man
was
manifestly
in
doubt
about
the
effect
of
their
recent
conversation
my
dear
scrope
it
began
i
find
myself
thinking
continually
about
our
interview
and
the
difficulties
you
laid
bare
so
frankly
to
me
we
touched
upon
many
things
in
that
talk
and
i
find
myself
full
of
afterthoughts
and
not
perfectly
sure
either
quite
of
what
i
said
or
of
what
i
failed
to
say
i
feel
that
in
many
ways
i
was
not
perhaps
so
clear
and
convincing
as
the
justice
of
my
case
should
have
made
me
and
you
are
one
of
my
own
particular
little
company
you
were
one
of
the
best
workers
in
that
band
of
good
workers
your
life
and
your
career
are
very
much
my
concern
i
know
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
still
mingle
something
of
the
paternal
with
my
fraternal
admonitions
i
watched
you
closely
i
have
still
my
old
diaries
of
the
matthew
days
and
i
have
been
looking
at
them
to
remind
me
of
what
you
once
were
it
was
my
custom
to
note
my
early
impressions
of
all
the
men
who
worked
with
me
because
i
have
a
firm
belief
in
the
soundness
of
first
impressions
and
the
considerable
risk
one
runs
of
having
them
obscured
by
the
accidents
and
habituations
of
constant
intercourse
i
found
that
quite
early
in
your
days
at
matthew
i
wrote
against
your
name
but
a
saving
delicacy
after
all
our
friendship
i
would
not
write
anything
truer
i
would
say
of
you
man
might
have
been
a
revivalist
if
he
were
not
a
gentleman
there
is
the
enthusiast
there
is
the
revivalist
in
you
it
seems
to
me
that
the
stresses
and
questions
of
this
great
crisis
in
the
world
history
have
brought
it
nearer
to
the
surface
than
i
had
ever
expected
it
to
come
i
quite
understand
and
i
sympathize
with
your
impatience
with
the
church
at
the
present
time
we
present
a
spectacle
of
pompous
insignificance
hard
to
bear
with
we
are
doing
very
little
and
we
are
giving
ourselves
preposterous
airs
there
seems
to
be
an
opinion
abroad
that
in
some
way
the
country
is
going
to
collapse
after
the
war
into
the
arms
of
the
church
and
the
high
tories
a
possibility
i
do
accept
for
a
moment
why
should
it
these
reactionaries
are
much
more
likely
to
explode
a
revolution
that
will
disestablish
us
and
i
quite
understand
your
theological
difficulties
quite
the
creeds
if
their
entire
symbolism
is
for
a
moment
forgotten
if
they
are
taken
as
opaque
statements
of
fact
are
inconsistent
incredible
so
incredible
that
no
one
believes
them
not
even
the
most
devout
the
utmost
they
do
is
to
avert
their
minds
reverentially
credo
quia
impossibile
that
is
offensive
to
a
western
mind
i
can
quite
understand
the
disposition
to
cry
out
at
such
things
is
not
the
church
of
god
to
run
out
from
it
you
have
some
dream
i
suspect
of
a
dramatic
dissidence
now
my
dear
brother
and
erstwhile
pupil
i
ask
you
not
to
do
this
thing
wait
i
implore
you
give
me
and
some
others
a
little
time
i
have
your
promise
for
three
months
but
even
after
that
i
ask
you
to
wait
let
the
reform
come
from
within
the
church
the
church
is
something
more
than
either
its
creeds
its
clergy
or
its
laymen
look
at
your
cathedral
rising
out
of
and
dominating
princhester
it
stands
not
simply
for
athanasius
it
stands
but
incidentally
for
athanasius
it
stands
for
all
religion
within
that
fabric
let
me
be
as
frank
here
as
in
our
private
conversation
doctrine
has
altered
again
and
again
two
distinct
religions
worship
there
side
by
side
one
that
fades
and
one
that
grows
brighter
there
is
the
old
belief
of
the
barbarians
the
belief
in
such
things
for
example
as
that
christ
the
physical
son
of
god
descended
into
hell
and
stayed
there
seeing
the
sights
i
suppose
like
any
tourist
and
being
treated
with
diplomatic
civilities
for
three
terrestrial
days
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
truly
spiritual
belief
that
you
and
i
share
which
is
absolutely
intolerant
of
such
grotesque
ideas
my
argument
to
you
is
that
the
new
faith
the
clearer
vision
gains
ground
that
the
only
thing
that
can
prevent
or
delay
the
church
from
being
altogether
possessed
by
what
you
call
and
i
admit
is
the
true
god
is
that
such
men
as
yourself
as
the
light
breaks
upon
you
should
be
hasty
and
leave
the
church
you
see
my
point
of
view
do
you
not
it
is
not
one
that
has
been
assumed
for
our
discussion
it
is
one
i
came
to
long
years
ago
that
i
was
already
feeling
my
way
to
in
my
matthew
lenton
sermons
a
word
for
your
private
ear
i
am
working
i
can
not
tell
you
fully
because
i
am
not
working
alone
but
there
are
movements
afoot
in
which
i
hope
very
shortly
to
be
able
to
ask
you
to
share
that
much
at
least
i
may
say
at
this
stage
obscure
but
very
powerful
influences
are
at
work
for
the
liberalizing
of
the
church
for
release
from
many
narrow
limitations
for
the
establishment
of
a
modus
vivendi
with
the
nonconformist
and
dissentient
bodies
in
britain
and
america
and
with
the
churches
of
the
east
but
of
that
no
more
now
and
in
conclusion
my
dear
scrope
let
me
insist
again
upon
the
eternal
persistence
of
the
essential
religious
fact
greek
letters
here
rev
i
fear
not
i
am
the
first
and
last
thing
the
living
and
these
promises
which
even
if
we
are
not
to
take
them
as
promises
in
the
exact
sense
in
which
let
us
say
the
payment
of
five
sovereigns
is
promised
by
a
note
are
yet
assertions
of
practically
inevitable
veracity
greek
letters
here
phil
i
he
who
began
will
eph
he
will
the
old
man
had
written
his
greek
tags
in
shakily
resolute
capitals
it
was
his
custom
always
to
quote
the
greek
testament
in
his
letters
never
the
english
version
it
is
a
practice
not
uncommon
with
the
more
scholarly
of
our
bishops
it
is
as
if
some
eminent
scientific
man
were
to
insist
upon
writing
instead
of
water
and
sodium
chloride
instead
of
table
salt
in
his
private
correspondence
or
upon
hanging
up
a
stuffed
crocodile
in
his
hall
to
give
the
place
tone
the
bishop
of
princhester
construed
these
brief
dicta
without
serious
exertion
he
found
them
very
congenial
texts
but
there
were
insuperable
difficulties
in
the
problem
why
likeman
should
suppose
they
had
the
slightest
weight
upon
his
side
of
their
discussion
the
more
he
thought
the
less
they
seemed
to
be
on
likeman
side
until
at
last
they
began
to
take
on
a
complexion
entirely
opposed
to
the
old
man
insidious
arguments
until
indeed
they
began
to
bear
the
extraordinary
interpretation
of
a
special
message
unwittingly
delivered
the
bishop
was
still
thinking
over
this
communication
when
he
was
interrupted
by
lady
ella
she
came
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
to
ask
him
whether
she
might
send
pounds
to
a
poor
cousin
of
his
a
teacher
in
a
girls
school
who
had
been
incapacitated
from
work
by
a
dislocation
of
the
cartilage
of
her
knee
if
she
could
go
to
that
unorthodox
but
successful
practitioner
barker
the
she
was
convinced
she
could
be
restored
to
efficiency
but
she
had
no
ready
money
the
bishop
agreed
without
hesitation
his
only
doubt
was
the
certainty
of
the
cure
but
upon
that
point
lady
ella
was
convinced
there
had
been
a
great
experience
in
the
walshingham
family
it
is
pleasant
to
be
able
to
do
things
like
this
said
lady
ella
standing
over
him
when
this
matter
was
settled
yes
the
bishop
agreed
it
is
pleasant
to
be
in
a
position
to
do
things
like
this
chapter
the
seventh
the
second
vision
a
month
later
found
the
bishop
original
state
of
perplexity
and
insomnia
returned
and
intensified
he
had
done
none
of
all
the
things
that
had
seemed
so
manifestly
needing
to
be
done
after
his
vision
in
the
athenaeum
all
the
relief
and
benefit
of
his
experience
in
london
had
vanished
out
of
his
life
he
was
afraid
of
dale
drug
he
knew
certainly
that
it
would
precipitate
matters
and
all
his
instincts
in
the
state
of
moral
enfeeblement
to
which
he
had
relapsed
were
to
temporize
although
he
had
said
nothing
further
about
his
changed
beliefs
to
lady
ella
yet
he
perceived
clearly
that
a
shadow
had
fallen
between
them
she
had
a
wife
extreme
sensitiveness
to
fine
shades
of
expression
and
bearing
and
manifestly
she
knew
that
something
was
different
meanwhile
lady
sunderbund
had
become
a
frequent
worshipper
in
the
cathedral
she
was
a
figure
as
conspicuous
in
sombre
princhester
as
a
bird
of
paradise
would
have
been
common
people
stood
outside
her
very
very
rich
blue
door
on
the
chance
of
seeing
her
she
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
hearing
the
bishop
preach
or
speak
she
wrote
him
several
long
and
thoughtful
letters
with
which
he
did
not
bother
lady
ella
she
communicated
persistently
and
manifestly
intended
to
become
a
very
active
worker
in
diocesan
affairs
it
was
inevitable
that
she
and
the
bishop
should
meet
and
talk
occasionally
in
the
cathedral
precincts
and
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
contrast
the
flexibility
of
her
rapid
and
very
responsive
mind
with
a
certain
defensiveness
a
stoniness
in
the
intellectual
bearing
of
lady
ella
if
it
had
been
lady
sunderbund
he
had
had
to
explain
to
instead
of
lady
ella
he
could
have
explained
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
since
his
mind
was
rehearsing
explanations
it
was
not
unnatural
they
should
overflow
into
this
eagerly
receptive
channel
and
that
the
less
he
told
lady
ella
the
fuller
became
his
spiritual
confidences
to
lady
sunderbund
she
was
clever
in
realizing
that
they
were
confidences
and
treating
them
as
such
more
particularly
when
it
chanced
that
she
and
lady
ella
and
the
bishop
found
themselves
in
the
same
conversation
she
made
great
friends
with
miriam
and
initiated
her
by
a
whole
collection
of
pretty
costume
plates
into
the
mysteries
of
the
ussian
ballet
and
the
works
of
and
imsky
the
bishop
liked
a
certain
religiosity
in
the
texture
of
music
but
failed
to
see
the
significance
of
many
of
the
costumes
it
was
on
a
sunday
night
the
fourth
sunday
after
easter
that
the
supreme
crisis
of
the
bishop
life
began
he
had
had
a
feeling
all
day
of
extreme
dulness
and
stupidity
he
felt
his
ministrations
unreal
his
ceremonies
absurd
and
undignified
in
the
night
he
became
bleakly
and
painfully
awake
his
mind
occupied
itself
at
first
chiefly
with
the
tortuousness
and
weakness
of
his
own
character
every
day
he
perceived
that
the
difficulty
of
telling
lady
ella
of
the
change
in
his
faith
became
more
mountainous
and
every
day
he
procrastinated
if
he
had
told
her
naturally
and
simply
on
the
evening
of
his
return
from
london
before
anything
material
intervened
everything
would
have
been
different
everything
would
have
been
simpler
he
groaned
and
rolled
over
in
his
bed
there
came
upon
him
the
acutest
remorse
and
misery
for
he
saw
that
amidst
these
petty
immediacies
he
had
lost
touch
with
god
the
last
month
became
incredible
he
had
seen
god
he
had
touched
god
hand
god
had
been
given
to
him
and
he
had
neglected
the
gift
he
was
still
lost
amidst
the
darkness
and
loneliness
the
chaotic
ends
and
mean
shifts
of
an
erastian
world
for
a
month
now
and
more
after
a
vision
of
god
so
vivid
and
real
and
reassuring
that
surely
no
saint
nor
prophet
had
ever
had
a
better
he
had
made
no
more
than
vague
responsive
movements
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
into
an
unreasonable
and
cowardly
delay
and
the
fetters
of
association
and
usage
and
minor
interests
were
as
unbroken
as
they
had
been
before
ever
the
vision
shone
was
it
credible
that
there
had
ever
been
such
a
vision
in
a
life
so
entirely
dictated
by
immediacy
and
instinct
as
his
we
are
all
creatures
of
the
dark
stream
we
swim
in
needs
and
bodily
impulses
and
small
vanities
if
ever
and
again
a
bubble
of
spiritual
imaginativeness
glows
out
of
us
it
breaks
and
leaves
us
where
we
were
louse
that
i
am
he
cried
he
still
believed
in
god
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
he
believed
in
the
god
that
he
had
seen
the
high
courage
the
golden
intention
the
light
that
had
for
a
moment
touched
him
but
what
had
he
to
do
with
god
he
the
loiterer
the
little
thing
he
was
little
he
was
funny
his
prevarications
with
his
wife
for
example
were
comic
there
was
no
other
word
for
him
but
he
rolled
back
again
and
lay
staring
who
will
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
what
right
has
a
little
bishop
in
a
purple
stock
and
doeskin
breeches
who
hangs
back
in
his
palace
from
the
very
call
of
god
to
a
phrase
so
fine
and
tragic
as
the
body
of
this
death
he
was
the
most
unreal
thing
in
the
universe
he
was
a
base
insect
giving
himself
airs
what
advantage
has
a
bishop
over
the
praying
mantis
that
cricket
which
apes
the
attitude
of
piety
does
he
matter
more
to
god
to
the
god
of
the
universe
who
can
tell
to
the
god
of
man
he
sat
up
in
bed
struck
by
his
own
answer
and
full
of
an
indescribable
hunger
for
god
and
an
indescribable
sense
of
his
complete
want
of
courage
to
make
the
one
simple
appeal
that
would
satisfy
that
hunger
he
tried
to
pray
o
god
he
cried
forgive
me
take
me
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
really
praying
but
only
making
believe
to
pray
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
really
existing
but
only
seeming
to
exist
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
one
with
figures
on
a
china
plate
with
figures
painted
on
walls
with
the
flimsy
imagined
lives
of
men
in
stories
of
forgotten
times
o
god
he
said
o
god
acting
a
gesture
mimicking
appeal
anaemic
he
said
and
was
given
an
idea
he
got
out
of
bed
he
took
his
keys
from
the
at
the
bed
head
and
went
to
his
bureau
he
stood
with
dale
tonic
in
his
hand
he
remained
for
some
time
holding
it
and
feeling
a
curious
indisposition
to
go
on
with
the
thing
in
his
mind
he
turned
at
last
with
an
effort
he
carried
the
little
phial
to
his
bedside
and
into
the
tumbler
of
his
he
let
the
drops
fall
drop
by
drop
until
he
had
counted
twenty
then
holding
it
to
the
bulb
of
his
reading
lamp
he
added
the
water
and
stood
watching
the
slow
pearly
eddies
in
the
mixture
mingle
into
an
opalescent
uniformity
he
replaced
the
and
stood
with
the
glass
in
his
hand
but
he
did
not
drink
he
was
afraid
he
knew
that
he
had
only
to
drink
and
this
world
of
confusion
would
grow
transparent
would
roll
back
and
reveal
the
great
simplicities
behind
and
he
was
afraid
he
was
afraid
of
that
greatness
he
was
afraid
of
the
great
imperatives
that
he
knew
would
at
once
take
hold
of
his
life
he
wanted
to
muddle
on
for
just
a
little
longer
he
wanted
to
stay
just
where
he
was
in
his
familiar
with
the
key
of
escape
in
his
hand
before
he
took
the
last
step
into
the
very
presence
of
truth
he
would
think
he
put
down
the
glass
and
lay
down
upon
his
bed
he
awoke
in
a
mood
of
great
depression
out
of
a
dream
of
wandering
interminably
in
an
endless
building
of
innumerable
pillars
pillars
so
vast
and
high
that
the
ceiling
was
lost
in
darkness
by
the
scale
of
these
pillars
he
felt
himself
scarcely
larger
than
an
ant
he
was
always
alone
in
these
wanderings
and
always
missing
something
that
passed
along
distant
passages
something
desirable
something
in
the
nature
of
a
procession
or
of
a
ceremony
something
of
which
he
was
in
futile
pursuit
of
which
he
heard
faint
echoes
something
luminous
of
which
he
seemed
at
times
to
see
the
last
fading
reflection
across
vast
halls
and
wildernesses
of
shining
pavement
and
through
cyclopaean
archways
at
last
there
was
neither
sound
nor
gleam
but
the
utmost
solitude
and
a
darkness
and
silence
and
the
uttermost
profundity
of
sorrow
it
was
bright
day
dunk
had
just
come
into
the
room
with
his
tea
and
the
tumbler
of
dale
tonic
stood
untouched
upon
the
the
bishop
sat
up
in
bed
he
had
missed
his
opportunity
was
a
busy
day
he
knew
no
he
said
as
dunk
hesitated
whether
to
remove
or
leave
the
tumbler
leave
dunk
found
room
for
it
upon
the
and
vanished
softly
with
the
bishop
evening
clothes
the
bishop
remained
motionless
facing
the
day
there
stood
the
draught
of
decision
that
he
had
lacked
the
decision
even
to
touch
from
his
bed
he
could
just
read
the
larger
items
that
figured
upon
the
engagement
tablet
which
it
was
whippham
business
to
fill
and
place
upon
his
table
he
had
two
confirmation
services
first
the
big
one
in
the
cathedral
and
then
a
second
one
in
the
evening
at
pringle
various
committees
and
an
interview
with
chasters
he
had
not
yet
finished
his
addresses
for
these
confirmation
services
the
task
seemed
mountainous
overwhelming
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
he
seized
the
tumblerful
of
tonic
and
drank
it
off
at
a
gulp
for
some
moments
nothing
seemed
to
happen
then
he
began
to
feel
stronger
and
less
wretched
and
then
came
a
throbbing
and
tingling
of
artery
and
nerve
he
had
a
sense
of
adventure
a
pleasant
fear
in
the
thing
that
he
had
done
he
got
out
of
bed
leaving
his
cup
of
tea
untasted
and
began
to
dress
he
had
the
sensation
of
relief
a
prisoner
may
feel
who
suddenly
tries
his
cell
door
and
finds
it
open
upon
sunshine
the
outside
world
and
freedom
he
went
on
dressing
although
he
was
certain
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
world
of
delusion
about
him
would
dissolve
and
that
he
would
find
himself
again
in
the
great
freedom
of
the
place
of
god
this
time
the
transition
came
much
sooner
and
much
more
rapidly
this
time
the
phases
and
quality
of
the
experience
were
different
he
felt
once
again
that
luminous
confusion
between
the
world
in
which
a
human
life
is
imprisoned
and
a
circumambient
and
interpenetrating
world
but
this
phase
passed
very
rapidly
it
did
not
spread
out
over
nearly
half
an
hour
as
it
had
done
before
and
almost
immediately
he
seemed
to
plunge
away
from
everything
in
this
life
altogether
into
that
outer
freedom
he
sought
and
this
time
there
was
not
even
the
elemental
scenery
of
the
former
vision
he
stood
on
nothing
there
was
nothing
below
and
nothing
above
him
there
was
no
sense
of
falling
no
terror
but
a
feeling
as
though
he
floated
released
there
was
no
light
but
as
it
were
a
clear
darkness
about
him
then
it
was
manifest
to
him
that
he
was
not
alone
but
that
with
him
was
that
same
being
that
in
his
former
vision
had
called
himself
the
angel
of
god
he
knew
this
without
knowing
why
he
knew
this
and
either
he
spoke
and
was
answered
or
he
thought
and
his
thought
answered
him
back
his
state
of
mind
on
this
occasion
was
altogether
different
from
the
first
vision
of
god
before
it
had
been
spectacular
but
now
his
perception
was
altogether
and
nevertheless
and
all
the
time
it
seemed
that
very
faintly
he
was
still
in
his
room
it
was
he
who
was
the
first
to
speak
the
great
angel
whom
he
felt
rather
than
saw
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
to
speak
i
have
come
he
said
because
once
more
i
desire
to
see
but
you
have
seen
i
saw
god
god
was
light
god
was
truth
and
i
went
back
to
my
life
and
god
was
hidden
god
seemed
to
call
me
he
called
i
heard
him
i
sought
him
and
i
touched
his
hand
when
i
went
back
to
my
life
i
was
presently
lost
in
perplexity
i
could
not
tell
why
god
had
called
me
nor
what
i
had
to
and
why
did
you
not
come
here
before
doubt
and
fear
brother
will
you
not
lay
your
hand
on
mine
the
figure
in
the
darkness
became
distincter
but
nothing
touched
the
bishop
seeking
hands
i
want
to
see
god
and
to
understand
him
i
want
reassurance
i
want
conviction
i
want
to
understand
all
that
god
asks
me
to
do
the
world
is
full
of
conflict
and
confusion
and
the
spirit
of
war
it
is
dark
and
dreadful
now
with
suffering
and
bloodshed
i
want
to
serve
god
who
could
save
it
and
i
do
not
know
it
seemed
to
the
bishop
that
now
he
could
distinguish
dimly
but
surely
the
form
and
features
of
the
great
angel
to
whom
he
talked
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
and
then
the
angel
spoke
it
was
necessary
first
said
the
angel
that
you
should
apprehend
god
and
desire
him
that
was
the
purport
of
your
first
vision
now
since
you
require
it
i
will
tell
you
and
show
you
certain
things
about
him
things
that
it
seems
you
need
to
know
things
that
all
men
need
to
know
know
then
first
that
the
time
is
at
hand
when
god
will
come
into
the
world
and
rule
it
and
when
men
will
know
what
is
required
of
them
this
time
is
close
at
hand
in
a
little
while
god
will
be
made
manifest
throughout
the
earth
men
will
know
him
and
know
that
he
is
king
to
you
this
truth
is
to
be
shown
that
you
may
tell
it
to
this
is
no
vision
said
the
bishop
no
dream
that
will
pass
away
am
i
not
here
beside
you
the
bishop
was
anxious
to
be
very
clear
things
that
had
been
shapelessly
present
in
his
mind
now
took
form
and
found
words
for
themselves
the
god
i
saw
in
my
vision
he
is
not
yet
manifest
in
the
world
he
comes
he
is
in
the
world
but
he
is
not
yet
manifested
he
whom
you
saw
in
your
vision
will
speedily
be
manifest
in
the
world
to
you
this
vision
is
given
of
the
things
that
come
the
world
is
already
glowing
with
god
mankind
is
like
a
smouldering
fire
that
will
presently
in
quite
a
little
time
burst
out
into
flame
in
your
former
vision
i
showed
you
god
said
the
angel
this
time
i
will
show
you
certain
signs
of
the
coming
of
god
and
then
you
will
understand
the
place
you
hold
in
the
world
and
the
task
that
is
required
of
and
as
the
angel
spoke
he
lifted
up
his
hands
with
the
palms
upward
and
there
appeared
above
them
a
little
round
cloud
that
grew
denser
until
it
had
the
likeness
of
a
silver
sphere
it
was
a
mirror
in
the
form
of
a
ball
but
a
mirror
not
shining
uniformly
it
was
discoloured
with
greyish
patches
that
had
a
familiar
shape
it
circled
slowly
upon
the
angel
hands
it
seemed
no
greater
than
the
compass
of
a
human
skull
and
yet
it
was
as
great
as
the
earth
indeed
it
showed
the
whole
earth
it
was
the
earth
the
hands
of
the
angel
vanished
out
of
sight
dissolved
and
vanished
and
the
spinning
world
hung
free
all
about
the
bishop
the
velvet
darkness
broke
into
glittering
points
that
shaped
out
the
constellations
and
nearest
to
them
so
near
as
to
seem
only
a
few
million
miles
away
in
the
great
emptiness
into
which
everything
had
resolved
itself
shone
the
sun
a
ball
of
fires
the
angel
was
but
a
voice
now
the
bishop
and
the
angel
were
somewhere
aloof
from
and
yet
accessible
to
the
circling
silver
sphere
at
the
time
all
that
happened
seemed
to
happen
quite
naturally
as
things
happen
in
a
dream
it
was
only
later
when
all
this
was
a
matter
of
memory
that
the
bishop
realized
how
strange
and
incomprehensible
his
vision
had
been
the
sphere
was
the
earth
with
all
its
continents
and
seas
its
ships
and
cities
its
and
mountain
ranges
it
was
so
small
that
he
could
see
it
all
at
once
and
so
great
and
full
that
he
could
see
everything
in
it
he
could
see
great
countries
like
little
patches
upon
it
and
at
the
same
time
he
could
see
the
faces
of
the
men
upon
the
highways
he
could
see
the
feelings
in
men
hearts
and
the
thoughts
in
their
minds
but
it
did
not
seem
in
any
way
wonderful
to
the
bishop
that
so
he
should
see
those
things
or
that
it
was
to
him
that
these
things
were
shown
this
is
the
whole
world
he
said
this
is
the
vision
of
the
world
the
angel
answered
it
is
very
wonderful
said
the
bishop
and
stood
for
a
moment
marvelling
at
the
compass
of
his
vision
for
here
was
india
here
was
samarkand
in
the
light
of
the
late
afternoon
and
china
and
the
swarming
cities
upon
her
silvery
rivers
sinking
through
twilight
to
the
night
and
throwing
a
spray
and
tracery
of
lantern
spots
upon
the
dark
here
was
russia
under
the
noontide
and
so
great
a
battle
of
artillery
raging
on
the
dunajec
as
no
man
had
ever
seen
before
whole
lines
of
trenches
dissolved
into
clouds
of
dust
and
heaps
of
earth
here
close
to
the
waiting
streets
of
constantinople
were
the
hills
of
gallipoli
the
grave
of
british
imperialism
streaming
to
heaven
with
the
dust
and
smoke
of
bursting
shells
and
rifle
fire
and
the
smoke
and
flame
of
burning
brushwood
in
the
sea
of
marmora
a
big
ship
crowded
with
turkish
troops
was
sinking
and
purple
under
the
clear
water
he
could
see
the
shape
of
the
british
submarine
which
had
torpedoed
her
and
had
submerged
and
was
going
away
berlin
prepared
its
frugal
meals
still
far
from
famine
he
saw
the
war
in
europe
as
if
he
saw
it
on
a
map
yet
every
human
detail
showed
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
trenches
east
and
west
of
germany
he
could
see
shells
bursting
and
the
men
below
dropping
and
the
going
back
with
the
wounded
the
roads
to
every
front
were
crowded
with
reserves
and
munitions
for
a
moment
a
little
group
of
men
indifferent
to
all
this
struggle
who
were
landing
amidst
the
antarctic
wilderness
held
his
attention
and
then
his
eyes
went
westward
to
the
dark
rolling
atlantic
across
which
as
the
edge
of
the
night
was
drawn
like
a
curtain
more
and
still
more
ships
became
visible
beating
upon
their
courses
eastward
or
westward
under
the
overtaking
day
the
wonder
increased
the
wonder
of
the
single
and
infinitely
multitudinous
adventure
of
mankind
so
god
perhaps
sees
it
he
whispered
look
at
this
man
said
the
angel
and
the
black
shadow
of
a
hand
seemed
to
point
it
was
a
chinaman
sitting
with
two
others
in
a
little
low
room
separated
by
translucent
paper
windows
from
a
noisy
street
of
people
the
three
had
been
talking
of
the
ultimatum
that
japan
had
sent
that
day
to
china
claiming
a
priority
in
many
matters
over
european
influences
they
were
by
no
means
sure
whether
it
was
a
wrong
or
a
benefit
that
had
been
done
to
their
country
from
that
topic
they
had
passed
to
the
discussion
of
the
war
and
then
of
wars
and
national
aggressions
and
the
perpetual
thrusting
and
quarrelling
of
mankind
the
older
man
had
said
that
so
life
would
always
be
it
was
the
will
of
heaven
the
little
very
emaciated
man
had
agreed
with
him
but
now
this
younger
man
to
whose
thoughts
the
angel
had
so
particularly
directed
the
bishop
attention
was
speaking
he
did
not
agree
with
his
companion
war
is
not
the
will
of
heaven
he
said
it
is
the
blindness
of
man
changes
he
said
from
day
to
day
and
from
age
to
age
the
science
of
the
west
has
taught
us
that
man
changes
and
war
changes
and
all
things
change
china
has
been
the
land
of
flowery
peace
and
she
may
yet
give
peace
to
all
the
world
she
has
put
aside
that
puppet
emperor
at
peking
she
turns
her
face
to
the
new
learning
of
the
west
as
a
man
lays
aside
his
heavy
robes
in
order
that
her
task
may
be
the
older
man
spoke
his
manner
was
more
than
a
little
incredulous
and
yet
not
altogether
contemptuous
you
believe
that
someday
there
will
be
no
more
war
in
the
world
that
a
time
will
come
when
men
will
no
longer
plot
and
plan
against
the
welfare
of
men
even
that
last
said
the
younger
man
did
any
of
us
dream
years
ago
that
here
in
china
we
should
live
to
see
a
republic
the
age
of
the
republics
draws
near
when
men
in
every
country
of
the
world
will
look
straight
up
to
the
rule
of
right
and
the
empire
of
and
god
will
be
king
of
the
world
said
the
angel
is
not
that
faith
exactly
the
faith
that
is
coming
to
you
the
two
other
chinamen
questioned
their
companion
but
without
hostility
this
war
said
the
chinaman
will
end
in
a
great
harvesting
of
but
japan
the
older
man
began
the
bishop
would
have
liked
to
hear
more
of
that
conversation
but
the
dark
hand
of
the
angel
motioned
him
to
another
part
of
the
world
listen
to
this
said
the
angel
he
pointed
the
bishop
to
where
the
armies
of
britain
and
turkey
lay
in
the
heat
of
mesopotamia
along
the
sandy
bank
of
a
wide
river
rode
two
horsemen
an
englishman
and
a
turk
they
were
returning
from
the
turkish
lines
whither
the
englishman
had
been
with
a
flag
of
truce
when
englishmen
and
turks
are
thrown
together
they
soon
become
friends
and
in
this
case
matters
had
been
facilitated
by
the
englishman
command
of
the
turkish
language
he
was
quite
an
exceptional
englishman
the
turk
had
just
been
remarking
cheerfully
that
it
would
please
the
germans
if
they
were
to
discover
how
amiably
he
and
his
charge
had
got
on
it
a
pity
we
ever
ceased
to
be
friends
he
said
you
englishmen
are
like
our
christians
he
went
on
the
englishmen
wanted
to
know
why
you
have
priests
in
robes
you
do
chant
and
worship
crosses
and
pictures
and
quarrel
among
we
worship
the
same
god
as
you
do
said
the
englishman
then
why
do
we
fight
that
what
we
want
to
why
do
you
call
yourselves
christians
and
take
part
against
us
all
who
worship
the
one
god
are
they
ought
to
be
said
the
englishman
and
thought
he
was
struck
by
what
seemed
to
him
an
amazingly
novel
idea
if
it
were
for
religions
all
men
would
serve
god
together
he
said
and
then
there
would
be
no
wars
only
now
and
then
perhaps
just
a
little
honest
fighting
and
see
here
said
the
angel
here
close
behind
this
frightful
battle
where
the
german
phalanx
of
guns
pounds
its
way
through
the
russian
hosts
here
is
a
young
german
talking
to
two
wounded
russian
prisoners
who
have
stopped
to
rest
by
the
roadside
he
is
a
german
of
east
prussia
he
knows
and
thinks
a
little
russian
and
they
too
are
saying
all
three
of
them
that
the
war
is
not
god
will
but
the
confusion
of
mankind
here
he
said
and
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hovered
over
the
of
benares
where
a
brahmin
of
the
new
persuasion
watched
the
straight
spires
of
funereal
smoke
ascend
into
the
glow
of
the
late
afternoon
while
he
talked
to
an
english
painter
his
friend
of
the
blind
intolerance
of
race
and
caste
and
custom
in
india
or
the
angel
pointed
to
a
group
of
people
who
had
gathered
upon
a
little
beach
at
the
head
of
a
norwegian
fiord
there
were
three
lads
an
old
man
and
two
women
and
they
stood
about
the
body
of
a
drowned
german
sailor
which
had
been
washed
up
that
day
for
a
time
they
had
talked
in
whispers
but
now
suddenly
the
old
man
spoke
aloud
this
is
the
fourth
that
has
come
ashore
he
said
poor
drowned
souls
because
men
will
not
serve
but
folks
go
to
church
and
pray
enough
said
one
of
the
women
they
do
not
serve
god
said
the
old
man
they
just
pray
to
him
as
one
nods
to
a
beggar
they
do
not
serve
god
who
is
their
king
they
set
up
their
false
kings
and
emperors
and
so
all
europe
is
covered
with
dead
and
the
seas
wash
up
these
dead
to
us
why
does
the
world
suffer
these
things
why
did
we
norwegians
who
are
a
people
permit
the
germans
and
the
swedes
and
the
english
to
set
up
a
king
over
us
because
we
lack
faith
kings
mean
secret
counsels
and
secret
counsels
bring
war
sooner
or
later
war
will
come
to
us
also
if
we
give
the
soul
of
our
nation
in
trust
to
a
king
but
things
will
not
always
be
thus
with
men
god
will
not
suffer
them
for
ever
a
day
comes
and
it
is
no
distant
day
when
god
himself
will
rule
the
earth
and
when
men
will
do
not
what
the
king
wishes
nor
what
is
expedient
nor
what
is
customary
but
what
is
manifestly
but
men
are
saying
that
now
in
a
thousand
places
said
the
angel
here
is
something
that
goes
a
little
beyond
his
pointing
hand
went
southward
until
they
saw
the
africanders
riding
down
to
windhuk
two
men
boer
farmers
both
rode
side
by
side
and
talked
of
the
german
officer
they
brought
prisoner
with
them
he
had
put
in
the
wells
of
his
life
was
fairly
forfeit
and
he
was
not
to
be
killed
we
want
no
more
hate
in
south
africa
they
agreed
dutch
and
english
and
german
must
live
here
now
side
by
side
men
can
not
always
be
and
see
his
thoughts
said
the
angel
the
german
mind
was
one
amazement
he
had
been
sure
of
being
shot
he
had
meant
to
make
a
good
end
fierce
and
scornful
a
relentless
fighter
to
the
last
and
these
men
who
might
have
shot
him
like
a
man
were
going
to
spare
him
like
a
dog
his
mind
was
a
tumbled
muddle
of
old
and
new
ideas
he
had
been
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
the
foulest
and
fiercest
militarism
he
had
been
trained
to
relentlessness
ruthlessness
and
so
forth
war
was
war
and
the
bitterer
the
better
frightfulness
was
your
way
to
victory
over
every
enemy
but
these
people
had
found
a
better
way
here
were
dutch
and
english
side
by
side
sixteen
years
ago
they
had
been
at
war
together
and
now
they
wore
the
same
uniform
and
rode
together
and
laughed
at
him
for
a
queer
fellow
because
he
was
for
spitting
at
them
and
defying
them
and
folding
his
arms
and
looking
level
at
the
executioners
rifles
there
were
to
be
no
rifles
if
it
was
so
with
dutch
and
english
why
should
it
be
so
presently
with
french
and
germans
why
someday
should
french
german
dutch
and
english
russian
and
pole
ride
together
under
this
new
star
of
mankind
the
southern
cross
to
catch
whatever
last
was
left
to
poison
the
wells
of
goodwill
his
mind
resisted
and
struggled
against
these
ideas
austere
he
whispered
the
ennobling
tests
of
a
trooner
rode
up
alongside
and
offered
him
a
drink
of
water
just
a
mouthful
he
said
apologetically
we
had
to
go
rather
there
another
brain
busy
here
with
the
same
idea
the
angel
interrupted
and
the
bishop
found
himself
looking
into
the
bedroom
of
a
young
german
attache
in
washington
sleepless
in
the
small
hours
ach
cried
the
young
man
and
sat
up
in
bed
and
ran
his
hands
through
his
fair
hair
he
had
been
working
late
upon
this
detestable
business
of
the
lusitania
the
news
of
her
sinking
had
come
to
hand
two
days
before
and
all
america
was
aflame
with
it
it
might
mean
war
his
task
had
been
to
pour
out
explanations
and
justifications
to
the
press
to
show
that
it
was
an
act
of
necessity
to
pretend
a
conviction
that
the
great
ship
was
loaded
with
munitions
to
fight
down
the
hostility
and
anger
that
blazed
across
a
continent
he
had
worked
to
his
limit
he
had
taken
cup
after
cup
of
coffee
and
had
come
to
bed
worked
out
not
two
hours
ago
now
here
he
was
awake
after
a
nightmare
of
drowning
women
and
children
trying
to
comfort
his
soul
by
recalling
his
own
arguments
never
once
since
the
war
began
had
he
doubted
the
rightness
of
the
german
cause
it
seemed
only
a
proof
of
his
nervous
exhaustion
that
he
could
doubt
it
now
germany
was
the
best
organized
most
cultivated
scientific
and
liberal
nation
the
earth
had
ever
seen
it
was
for
the
good
of
mankind
that
she
should
be
the
dominant
power
in
the
world
his
patriotism
had
had
the
passion
of
a
mission
the
english
were
indolent
the
french
decadent
the
russians
barbaric
the
americans
basely
democratic
the
rest
of
the
world
was
the
white
man
burthen
the
clear
destiny
of
mankind
was
subservience
to
the
good
prussian
eagle
nevertheless
those
wet
draggled
bodies
that
swirled
down
in
the
eddies
of
the
sinking
titan
ach
he
wished
it
could
have
been
otherwise
he
nursed
his
knees
and
prayed
that
there
need
not
be
much
more
of
these
things
before
the
spirit
of
the
enemy
was
broken
and
the
great
peace
of
germany
came
upon
the
world
and
suddenly
he
stopped
short
in
his
prayer
suddenly
out
of
the
nothingness
and
darkness
about
him
came
the
conviction
that
god
did
not
listen
to
his
prayers
was
there
any
other
way
it
was
the
most
awful
doubt
he
had
ever
had
for
it
smote
at
the
training
of
all
his
life
could
it
be
possible
that
after
all
our
old
german
god
is
not
the
proper
style
and
title
of
the
true
god
is
our
old
german
god
perhaps
only
the
last
of
a
long
succession
of
bloodstained
tribal
effigies
and
not
god
at
all
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
that
the
bishop
watched
the
thoughts
that
gathered
in
the
young
attache
mind
until
suddenly
he
broke
into
a
quotation
into
that
last
cry
of
the
dying
goethe
for
light
more
light
leave
him
at
that
said
the
angel
i
want
you
to
hear
these
two
young
the
hand
came
back
to
england
and
pointed
to
where
southend
at
the
mouth
of
the
thames
was
all
agog
with
the
excitement
of
an
overnight
zeppelin
raid
people
had
got
up
hours
before
their
usual
time
in
order
to
look
at
the
wrecked
houses
before
they
went
up
to
their
work
in
town
everybody
seemed
abroad
two
nurses
not
very
well
trained
as
nurses
go
nor
very
women
were
snatching
a
little
sea
air
upon
the
front
after
an
eventful
night
they
were
too
excited
still
to
sleep
they
were
talking
of
the
horror
of
the
moment
when
they
saw
the
nasty
thing
up
there
and
felt
helpless
as
it
dropped
its
bombs
they
had
both
hated
it
there
did
ought
to
be
such
things
said
one
they
do
seem
needed
said
her
companion
men
wo
always
go
on
like
this
making
wars
and
all
such
it
to
stop
them
science
is
going
to
stop
science
yes
science
my
young
brother
oh
he
a
clever
one
he
says
such
things
he
says
that
it
science
that
they
wo
always
go
on
like
this
there
more
sense
coming
into
the
world
and
more
my
young
brother
says
so
says
it
stands
to
reason
it
evolution
it
science
that
men
are
all
brothers
you
can
prove
it
it
science
that
there
ought
to
be
war
science
is
ending
war
now
by
making
it
horrible
like
this
and
making
it
so
that
no
one
is
safe
showing
it
up
only
when
nobody
is
safe
will
everybody
want
to
set
up
peace
he
says
he
says
it
proved
there
could
easily
be
peace
all
over
the
world
now
if
it
was
for
flags
and
kings
and
capitalists
and
priests
they
still
manage
to
keep
safe
and
out
of
it
he
says
the
world
ought
to
be
just
one
state
the
world
state
he
says
it
ought
to
under
god
said
the
bishop
under
he
says
science
ought
to
be
king
of
the
whole
call
it
science
if
you
will
said
the
bishop
god
is
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
elementary
science
students
said
the
angel
the
very
children
in
the
board
schools
are
turning
against
this
narrowness
and
nonsense
and
mischief
of
nations
and
creeds
and
kings
you
see
it
at
a
thousand
points
at
ten
thousand
points
look
the
world
is
all
flashing
and
flickering
it
is
like
a
spinthariscope
it
is
aquiver
with
the
light
that
is
coming
to
mankind
it
is
on
the
verge
of
blazing
even
into
a
into
the
one
kingdom
of
god
see
here
see
here
and
here
this
brave
little
french
priest
in
a
helmet
of
steel
who
is
daring
to
think
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
this
emir
from
morocco
looking
at
the
on
the
battlefield
this
mother
who
has
lost
her
son
you
see
they
all
turn
in
one
direction
although
none
of
them
seem
to
dream
yet
that
they
are
all
turning
in
the
same
direction
they
turn
every
one
to
the
rule
of
righteousness
which
is
the
rule
of
god
they
turn
to
that
communism
of
effort
in
the
world
which
alone
permits
men
to
serve
god
in
state
and
city
and
their
economic
lives
they
are
all
coming
to
the
verge
of
the
same
salvation
the
salvation
of
one
human
brotherhood
under
the
rule
of
one
righteousness
one
divine
will
is
that
the
salvation
your
church
offers
and
now
that
we
have
seen
how
religion
grows
and
spreads
in
hearts
now
that
the
fields
are
white
with
harvest
i
want
you
to
look
also
and
see
what
the
teachers
of
religion
are
doing
said
the
angel
he
smiled
his
presence
became
more
definite
and
the
earthly
globe
about
them
and
the
sun
and
the
stars
grew
less
distinct
and
less
immediately
there
the
silence
invited
the
bishop
to
speak
in
the
light
of
this
vision
i
see
my
church
plainly
for
the
little
thing
it
is
he
said
he
wanted
to
be
perfectly
clear
with
the
angel
and
himself
this
church
of
which
i
am
a
bishop
is
just
a
part
of
our
poor
human
struggle
small
and
pitiful
as
one
thinks
of
it
here
in
the
light
of
the
advent
of
god
kingdom
but
very
great
very
great
indeed
ancient
and
high
and
venerable
in
comparison
with
me
but
mostly
it
is
human
it
is
most
human
for
my
story
is
the
church
story
and
the
church
story
is
mine
here
i
could
almost
believe
myself
the
church
itself
the
world
saw
a
light
the
nations
that
were
sitting
in
darkness
saw
a
great
light
even
as
i
saw
god
and
then
the
church
began
to
forget
and
lose
itself
among
secondary
things
as
i
have
done
it
tried
to
express
the
truth
and
lost
itself
in
a
maze
of
theology
it
tried
to
bring
order
into
the
world
and
sold
its
faith
to
constantine
these
men
who
had
professed
the
invisible
king
of
the
world
shirked
his
service
it
is
a
most
terrible
disaster
that
christianity
has
sold
itself
to
emperors
and
kings
they
forged
a
saying
of
the
master
that
we
should
render
unto
ceasar
the
things
that
are
ceasar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
who
is
this
ceasar
to
set
himself
up
to
share
mankind
with
god
nothing
that
is
ceasar
can
be
any
the
less
god
but
constantine
caesar
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
council
his
guards
were
all
about
it
and
the
poor
fanatics
and
trimmers
and
schemers
disputed
nervously
with
their
eyes
on
him
disputed
about
homoousian
and
homoiousian
and
grimaced
and
pretended
to
be
very
very
fierce
and
exact
to
hide
how
much
they
were
frightened
and
how
little
they
knew
and
because
they
did
not
dare
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
that
usurper
of
the
empire
of
the
world
and
from
that
day
forth
the
christian
churches
have
been
damned
and
lost
kept
churches
lackey
churches
roman
russian
anglican
it
matters
not
my
church
indeed
was
twice
sold
for
it
doubled
the
sin
of
nicaea
and
gave
itself
over
to
henry
and
elizabeth
while
it
shammed
a
dispute
about
the
sacraments
no
one
cared
really
about
transubstantiation
any
more
than
the
earlier
betrayers
cared
about
consubstantiality
that
dispute
did
but
serve
to
mask
the
he
turned
to
the
listening
angel
what
can
you
show
me
of
my
church
that
i
do
not
know
why
we
anglican
bishops
get
our
sees
as
footmen
get
a
job
for
months
victoria
that
old
german
frau
delayed
me
because
of
some
the
things
we
are
snape
who
afterwards
became
bishop
of
burnham
used
to
waylay
the
prince
consort
when
he
was
riding
in
hyde
park
and
give
him
he
boasts
good
loud
cheer
and
then
he
would
run
very
fast
across
the
park
so
as
to
catch
him
as
he
came
round
and
do
it
again
it
is
to
that
sort
of
thing
we
bearers
of
the
light
have
sunken
i
have
always
despised
that
poor
toady
the
bishop
went
on
and
yet
here
am
i
and
god
has
called
me
and
shown
me
the
light
of
his
countenance
and
for
a
month
i
have
faltered
that
is
the
mystery
of
the
human
heart
that
it
can
and
does
sin
against
the
light
what
right
have
i
who
have
seen
the
light
and
failed
what
right
have
i
to
despise
any
other
human
being
i
seem
to
have
been
held
back
by
a
sort
of
paralysis
men
are
so
small
so
small
still
that
they
can
not
keep
hold
of
the
vision
of
god
that
is
why
i
want
to
see
god
again
but
if
it
were
not
for
this
strange
drug
that
seems
for
a
little
while
to
lift
my
mind
above
the
confusion
and
personal
entanglements
of
every
day
i
doubt
if
even
now
i
could
be
here
i
am
here
passionate
to
hold
this
moment
and
keep
the
light
as
this
inspiration
passes
i
shall
go
back
i
know
to
my
home
and
my
place
and
my
limitations
the
littleness
of
men
the
forgetfulness
of
men
i
want
to
know
what
my
chief
duty
is
to
have
it
plain
in
terms
so
plain
that
i
can
never
forget
see
in
this
world
he
said
turning
to
the
globe
while
chinese
merchants
and
turkish
troopers
boys
and
norwegian
fishermen
nurses
and
boer
farmers
are
full
of
the
spirit
of
god
see
how
the
priests
of
the
churches
of
nicaea
spend
their
and
now
it
was
the
bishop
whose
dark
hands
ran
over
the
great
silver
globe
and
it
was
the
angel
who
stood
over
him
and
listened
as
a
teacher
might
stand
over
a
child
who
is
learning
a
lesson
the
hand
rested
for
a
second
on
a
cardinal
who
was
planning
a
political
intrigue
to
produce
a
reaction
in
france
then
for
a
moment
on
a
pomeranian
pastor
who
was
going
out
to
his
fields
with
his
sunday
sermon
full
of
fierce
hatred
of
england
still
echoing
in
his
head
then
he
paused
at
a
mollah
preaching
the
jehad
in
doubt
whether
he
too
was
a
german
pastor
and
then
at
an
anglican
clergyman
still
lying
abed
and
thinking
out
a
great
mission
of
repentance
and
hope
that
should
restore
the
authority
of
the
established
church
by
incoherent
missioning
without
any
definite
sin
indicated
for
repentance
nor
any
clear
hope
for
anything
in
particular
arising
out
of
such
activities
the
bishop
hand
went
seeking
to
and
fro
but
nowhere
could
he
find
any
religious
teacher
any
religious
body
rousing
itself
to
meet
the
new
dawn
of
faith
in
the
world
some
few
men
indeed
seemed
thoughtful
but
within
the
limitation
of
their
vows
everywhere
it
was
church
and
creed
and
nation
and
king
and
property
and
partisanship
and
nowhere
was
it
the
true
god
that
the
priests
and
teachers
were
upholding
it
was
always
the
common
unhampered
man
through
whom
the
light
of
god
was
breaking
it
was
always
the
creed
and
the
organization
of
the
religious
professionals
that
stood
in
the
way
to
god
god
is
putting
the
priests
aside
he
cried
and
reaching
out
to
common
men
the
churches
do
not
serve
god
they
stand
between
man
and
god
they
are
like
great
barricades
on
the
way
to
the
bishop
hand
brushed
over
archbishop
pontifex
who
was
just
coming
down
to
breakfast
in
his
palace
this
pompous
old
man
was
dressed
in
a
purple
garment
that
set
off
his
tall
figure
very
finely
and
he
was
holding
out
his
episcopal
ring
for
his
guests
to
kiss
that
being
the
customary
morning
greeting
of
archbishop
pontifex
the
thought
of
that
had
made
much
hard
work
at
lower
levels
worth
while
to
archbishop
pontifex
and
seventy
miles
away
from
him
old
likeman
breakfasted
in
bed
on
benger
food
and
searched
his
greek
testament
for
tags
to
put
to
his
letters
and
here
was
the
familiar
palace
at
princhester
and
in
an
armchair
in
his
sat
bishop
scrope
insensible
and
motionless
in
a
trance
in
which
he
was
dreaming
of
the
coming
of
god
i
see
my
futility
i
see
my
vanity
but
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
turning
to
the
darkness
that
now
wrapped
about
the
angel
again
fold
upon
fold
the
implications
of
yesterday
bind
me
for
the
morrow
this
is
my
world
this
is
what
i
am
and
what
i
am
in
how
can
i
save
myself
how
can
i
turn
from
these
habits
and
customs
and
obligations
to
the
service
of
the
one
true
god
when
i
see
myself
then
i
understand
how
it
is
with
the
others
all
we
priests
and
teachers
are
men
caught
in
nets
i
would
serve
god
easily
said
but
how
am
i
to
serve
god
how
am
i
to
help
and
forward
his
coming
to
make
myself
part
of
his
coming
he
perceived
that
he
was
returning
into
himself
and
that
the
vision
of
the
sphere
and
of
the
starry
spaces
was
fading
into
he
struggled
against
this
return
he
felt
that
his
demand
was
still
unanswered
his
wife
face
had
suddenly
come
very
close
to
him
and
he
realized
she
intervened
between
him
and
that
solution
what
was
she
doing
here
the
great
angel
seemed
still
to
be
near
at
hand
limitless
space
was
all
about
him
and
yet
the
bishop
perceived
that
he
was
now
sitting
in
the
in
his
bedroom
in
the
palace
of
princhester
he
was
both
there
and
not
there
it
seemed
now
as
if
he
had
two
distinct
yet
kindred
selves
and
that
the
former
watched
the
latter
the
latter
was
now
awakening
to
the
things
about
him
the
former
marked
his
gestures
and
listened
with
an
entire
detachment
to
the
words
he
was
saying
these
words
he
was
saying
to
lady
ella
god
is
coming
to
rule
the
world
i
tell
you
we
must
leave
the
close
to
him
sat
lady
ella
watching
him
with
an
expression
in
which
dismay
and
resolution
mingled
upon
the
other
side
of
him
upon
a
little
occasional
table
was
a
tray
with
breakfast
things
he
was
no
longer
the
watcher
now
but
the
watched
lady
ella
bent
towards
him
as
he
spoke
she
seemed
to
struggle
with
and
dismiss
his
astonishing
statement
edward
she
said
you
have
been
taking
a
he
looked
round
at
his
night
table
to
see
the
little
phial
it
had
gone
then
he
saw
that
lady
ella
held
it
very
firmly
in
her
hand
dunk
came
to
me
in
great
distress
he
said
you
were
insensible
and
breathing
heavily
i
came
i
realized
i
told
him
to
say
nothing
to
any
one
but
to
fetch
me
a
tray
with
your
breakfast
i
have
kept
all
the
other
servants
away
and
i
have
waited
here
by
you
dunk
i
think
is
safe
you
have
been
muttering
and
moving
your
head
from
side
to
side
the
bishop
mind
was
confused
he
felt
as
though
god
must
be
standing
just
outside
the
room
i
have
failed
in
my
duty
he
said
but
i
am
very
near
to
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
you
know
ella
he
is
very
close
to
us
she
looked
perplexed
he
sat
up
in
his
chair
for
some
months
now
he
said
there
have
been
new
forces
at
work
in
my
mind
i
have
been
invaded
by
strange
doubts
and
still
stranger
realizations
this
old
church
of
ours
is
an
empty
mask
god
is
not
specially
concerned
in
edward
she
cried
what
are
you
saying
i
have
been
hesitating
to
tell
you
but
i
see
now
i
must
tell
you
plainly
our
church
is
a
cast
hull
it
is
like
the
empty
skin
of
a
snake
god
has
gone
out
of
she
rose
to
her
feet
she
was
so
horrified
that
she
staggered
backward
pushing
her
chair
behind
her
but
you
are
mad
she
said
he
was
astonished
at
her
distress
he
stood
up
also
my
dear
he
said
i
can
assure
you
i
am
not
mad
i
should
have
prepared
you
i
know
she
looked
at
him
then
she
glanced
at
the
phial
gripped
in
her
hand
oh
she
exclaimed
and
going
swiftly
to
the
window
emptied
out
the
contents
of
the
little
bottle
he
realized
what
she
was
doing
too
late
to
prevent
her
do
waste
that
he
cried
and
stepping
forward
caught
hold
of
her
wrist
the
phial
fell
from
her
white
fingers
and
crashed
upon
the
rough
paved
garden
path
below
my
dear
he
cried
my
dear
you
do
not
they
stood
face
to
face
it
was
a
tonic
he
said
i
have
been
ill
i
need
it
is
a
drug
she
answered
you
have
been
uttering
he
dropped
her
arm
and
walked
across
the
room
then
he
turned
and
faced
her
they
are
not
blasphemies
he
said
but
i
ought
not
to
have
surprised
you
and
shocked
you
as
i
have
done
i
want
to
tell
you
of
changes
that
have
happened
to
my
now
she
exclaimed
and
then
i
will
not
hear
them
now
until
you
are
better
until
these
fumes
her
manner
changed
oh
edward
she
cried
why
have
you
done
this
why
have
you
taken
things
secretly
i
know
you
have
been
sleepless
but
i
have
been
so
ready
to
help
you
i
have
been
willing
you
know
i
have
been
willing
for
any
help
my
life
is
all
to
be
of
use
to
you
is
there
any
reason
she
pleaded
why
you
should
have
hidden
things
from
me
he
stood
remorseful
and
distressed
i
should
have
talked
to
you
he
said
lamely
edward
she
said
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
will
you
do
one
thing
for
me
will
you
try
to
eat
a
little
breakfast
and
stay
here
i
will
go
down
to
whippham
and
arrange
whatever
is
urgent
with
him
perhaps
if
you
rest
there
is
nothing
really
imperative
until
the
confirmation
in
the
afternoon
i
do
not
understand
all
this
for
some
time
i
have
felt
it
was
going
on
but
of
that
we
can
talk
the
thing
now
is
that
people
should
not
know
that
nothing
should
be
seen
suppose
for
instance
that
horrible
white
blackbird
were
to
hear
of
it
i
implore
you
if
you
rest
here
and
if
i
were
to
send
for
that
young
doctor
who
attended
i
do
want
a
doctor
said
the
bishop
but
you
ought
to
have
a
i
wo
have
a
doctor
said
the
bishop
it
was
with
a
perplexed
but
powerless
dissent
that
the
externalized
perceptions
of
the
bishop
witnessed
his
agreement
with
the
rest
of
lady
ella
proposals
so
soon
as
this
point
about
the
doctor
was
conceded
for
the
rest
of
that
day
until
his
breakdown
in
the
cathedral
the
sense
of
being
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
haunted
the
bishop
mind
he
stood
beside
the
angel
in
the
great
space
amidst
the
stars
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
back
in
his
ordinary
life
he
was
in
his
palace
at
princhester
first
resting
in
his
bedroom
and
talking
to
his
wife
and
presently
taking
up
the
routines
of
his
duties
again
in
his
study
downstairs
his
chief
task
was
to
finish
his
two
addresses
for
the
confirmation
services
of
the
day
he
read
over
his
notes
and
threw
them
aside
and
remained
for
a
time
thinking
deeply
the
greek
tags
at
the
end
of
likeman
letter
came
into
his
thoughts
they
assumed
a
quality
of
peculiar
relevance
to
this
present
occasion
he
repeated
the
words
epitelesei
he
took
his
little
testament
to
verify
them
after
some
slight
trouble
he
located
the
two
texts
the
first
from
philippians
ran
in
the
old
version
he
that
hath
begun
a
good
work
in
you
will
perform
it
the
second
was
expressed
thus
christ
shall
give
thee
he
was
dissatisfied
with
these
renderings
and
resorted
to
the
revised
version
which
gave
perfect
instead
of
perform
and
shall
shine
upon
you
for
give
thee
he
reflected
profoundly
for
a
time
then
suddenly
his
addresses
began
to
take
shape
in
his
mind
and
these
little
points
lost
any
significance
he
began
to
write
rapidly
and
as
he
wrote
he
felt
the
angel
stood
by
his
right
hand
and
read
and
approved
what
he
was
writing
there
were
moments
when
his
mind
seemed
to
be
working
entirely
beyond
his
control
he
had
a
transitory
questioning
whether
this
curious
intellectual
automatism
was
not
perhaps
what
people
meant
by
the
bishop
had
always
been
sensitive
to
the
secret
fount
of
pathos
that
is
hidden
in
the
spectacle
of
youth
long
years
ago
when
he
and
lady
ella
had
been
in
florence
he
had
been
moved
to
tears
by
the
beauty
of
the
eager
tobit
who
runs
beside
the
great
angel
in
the
picture
of
botticelli
and
suddenly
and
almost
as
uncontrollably
that
feeling
returned
at
the
sight
of
the
young
congregation
below
him
of
all
these
scores
of
neophytes
who
were
gathered
to
make
a
public
acknowledgment
of
god
the
war
has
invested
all
youth
now
with
the
shadow
of
tragedy
before
it
came
many
of
us
were
a
little
envious
of
youth
and
a
little
too
assured
of
its
certainty
of
happiness
all
that
has
changed
fear
and
a
certain
tender
solicitude
mingle
in
our
regard
for
every
child
not
a
lad
we
pass
in
the
street
but
may
presently
be
called
to
face
such
pain
and
stress
and
danger
as
no
ancient
hero
ever
knew
the
patronage
the
insolent
condescension
of
age
has
vanished
out
of
the
world
it
is
dreadful
to
look
upon
the
young
he
stood
surveying
the
faces
of
the
young
people
as
the
rector
read
the
preface
to
the
confirmation
service
how
simple
they
were
how
innocent
some
were
a
little
flushed
by
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
some
a
little
pallid
but
they
were
all
such
tender
faces
so
soft
in
outline
so
fresh
and
delicate
in
texture
and
colour
they
had
soft
credulous
mouths
some
glanced
sideways
at
one
another
some
listened
with
a
forced
intentness
the
expression
of
one
boy
sitting
in
a
corner
scat
struck
the
bishop
as
being
curiously
defiant
he
stood
very
erect
he
blinked
his
eyes
as
though
they
smarted
his
lips
were
compressed
bitterly
and
then
it
seemed
to
the
bishop
that
the
angel
stood
beside
him
and
gave
him
understanding
he
is
here
the
bishop
knew
because
he
could
not
avoid
coming
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
his
mother
wept
what
could
he
do
but
the
church
teaching
nowadays
fails
even
to
grip
the
minds
of
the
rector
came
to
the
end
of
his
preface
they
will
evermore
endeavour
themselves
faithfully
to
observe
such
things
as
they
by
their
own
confession
have
assented
like
a
smart
solicitor
pinning
them
down
said
the
bishop
to
himself
and
then
roused
himself
unrolled
the
little
paper
in
his
hand
leant
forward
and
straightway
began
his
first
address
nowadays
it
is
possible
to
say
very
unorthodox
things
indeed
in
an
anglican
pulpit
unchallenged
there
remains
no
alert
doctrinal
criticism
in
the
church
congregations
it
was
possible
therefore
for
the
bishop
to
say
all
that
follows
without
either
hindrance
or
disturbance
the
only
opposition
indeed
came
from
within
from
a
sense
of
dreamlike
incongruity
between
the
place
and
the
occasion
and
the
things
that
he
found
himself
delivering
all
ceremonies
he
began
grow
old
all
ceremonies
are
tainted
even
from
the
first
by
things
less
worthy
than
their
first
intention
and
you
my
dear
sons
and
daughters
who
have
gathered
in
this
worn
and
ancient
building
beneath
these
monuments
to
ancient
vanities
and
these
symbols
of
forgotten
or
abandoned
theories
about
the
mystery
of
god
will
do
well
to
distinguish
in
your
minds
between
what
is
essential
and
what
is
superfluous
and
confusing
in
this
dedication
you
make
of
yourselves
to
god
our
master
and
king
for
that
is
the
real
thing
you
seek
to
do
today
to
give
yourselves
to
god
this
is
your
spiritual
coming
of
age
in
which
you
set
aside
your
childish
dependence
upon
teachers
and
upon
taught
phrases
upon
rote
and
direction
and
stand
up
to
look
your
master
in
the
face
you
profess
a
great
brotherhood
when
you
do
that
a
brotherhood
that
goes
round
the
earth
that
numbers
men
of
every
race
and
nation
and
country
that
aims
to
bring
god
into
all
the
affairs
of
this
world
and
make
him
not
only
the
king
of
your
individual
lives
but
the
king
in
place
of
all
the
upstarts
usurpers
accidents
and
absurdities
who
bear
crowns
and
sceptres
today
of
an
united
he
paused
and
in
the
pause
he
heard
a
little
rustle
as
though
the
congregation
before
him
was
sitting
up
in
its
places
a
sound
that
always
nerves
and
reassures
an
experienced
preacher
this
my
dear
children
is
the
reality
of
this
grave
business
as
indeed
it
is
the
real
and
practical
end
of
all
true
religion
this
is
your
sacrament
urn
your
soldier
oath
you
salute
and
give
your
fealty
to
the
coming
kingdom
of
god
and
upon
that
i
would
have
you
fix
your
minds
to
the
exclusion
of
much
that
i
know
only
too
well
has
been
narrow
and
evil
and
sectarian
in
your
preparation
for
this
solemn
rite
god
is
like
a
precious
jewel
found
among
much
rubble
you
must
cast
the
rubble
from
you
the
crowning
triumph
of
the
human
mind
is
simplicity
the
supreme
significance
of
god
lies
in
his
unity
and
universality
the
god
you
salute
is
the
god
of
the
jews
and
gentiles
alike
the
god
of
islam
the
god
of
the
brahmo
somaj
the
unknown
god
of
many
a
righteous
unbeliever
he
is
not
the
god
of
those
felted
theologies
and
inexplicable
doctrines
with
which
your
teachers
may
have
confused
your
minds
i
would
have
it
very
clear
in
your
minds
that
having
drunken
the
draught
you
should
not
reverence
unduly
the
cracked
old
vessel
that
has
brought
it
to
your
lips
i
should
be
falling
short
of
my
duty
if
i
did
not
make
that
and
everything
i
mean
by
that
altogether
plain
to
he
saw
the
lad
whose
face
of
dull
defiance
he
had
marked
before
sitting
now
with
a
startled
interest
in
his
eyes
the
bishop
leant
over
the
desk
before
him
and
continued
in
the
persuasive
tone
of
a
man
who
speaks
of
things
too
manifest
for
laboured
argument
in
all
ages
religion
has
come
from
god
through
creative
men
and
in
all
ages
it
has
fallen
very
quickly
into
the
hands
of
intense
and
conservative
men
these
last
narrow
fearful
and
suspicious
have
sought
in
every
age
to
save
the
precious
gift
of
religion
by
putting
it
into
a
prison
of
formulae
and
asseverations
bear
that
in
mind
when
you
are
pressed
to
definition
it
is
as
if
you
made
a
box
hermetically
sealed
to
save
the
treasure
of
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
sea
but
they
have
sought
out
exact
statements
and
tortuous
explanations
of
the
plain
truth
of
god
they
have
tried
to
take
down
god
in
writing
to
commit
him
to
documents
to
embalm
his
living
faith
as
though
it
would
otherwise
corrupt
so
they
have
lost
god
and
fallen
into
endless
differences
disputes
violence
and
darkness
about
insignificant
things
they
have
divided
religion
between
this
creed
and
teacher
and
that
the
corruption
of
the
best
is
the
worst
said
aristotle
and
the
great
religions
of
the
world
and
especially
this
christianity
of
ours
are
the
ones
most
darkened
and
divided
and
wasted
by
the
fussings
and
false
exactitudes
of
the
and
the
sectary
there
is
no
lie
so
bad
as
a
stale
disfigured
truth
there
is
no
heresy
so
damnable
as
a
narrow
orthodoxy
all
religious
associations
carry
this
danger
of
the
that
misstates
and
the
that
divides
and
betrays
beware
of
that
danger
do
not
imagine
because
you
are
gathered
in
this
queerly
beautiful
old
building
today
because
i
preside
here
in
this
odd
raiment
of
an
odder
compromise
because
you
see
about
you
in
coloured
glass
and
carven
stone
the
emblems
of
much
vain
disputation
that
thereby
you
cut
yourselves
off
and
come
apart
from
the
great
world
of
faith
catholic
islamic
brahministic
buddhistic
that
grows
now
to
a
common
consciousness
of
the
near
advent
of
god
our
king
you
enter
that
waiting
world
fraternity
now
you
do
not
leave
it
this
place
this
church
of
ours
should
be
to
you
not
a
seclusion
and
a
fastness
but
a
door
i
could
quote
you
a
score
of
instances
to
establish
that
this
simple
universalism
was
also
the
teaching
of
christ
but
now
i
will
only
remind
you
that
it
was
mary
who
went
to
her
lord
simply
who
was
commended
and
not
martha
who
troubled
about
many
things
learn
from
the
mary
of
faith
and
not
from
these
marthas
of
the
creeds
let
us
abandon
the
presumptions
of
an
ignorant
past
the
perfection
of
doctrine
is
not
for
finite
men
give
yourselves
to
god
give
yourselves
to
god
not
to
churches
and
uses
but
to
god
to
god
simply
he
is
the
first
word
of
religion
and
the
last
he
is
alpha
he
is
omega
epitelesei
it
is
he
who
will
finish
the
good
work
the
bishop
ended
his
address
in
a
vivid
silence
then
he
began
his
interrogation
do
you
here
in
the
presence
of
god
and
of
this
congregation
renew
the
solemn
promise
and
vow
that
was
made
in
your
name
at
your
baptism
ratifying
and
confirming
the
same
in
your
own
persons
and
acknowledging
yourselves
he
stopped
short
the
next
words
were
bound
to
believe
and
do
all
those
things
which
your
godfathers
and
godmothers
then
undertook
for
he
could
not
stand
those
words
he
hesitated
and
then
substituted
acknowledge
yourselves
to
be
the
true
servants
of
the
one
god
who
is
the
lord
of
mankind
for
a
moment
silence
hung
in
the
cathedral
then
one
voice
a
voice
led
a
ragged
response
i
then
the
bishop
our
help
is
in
the
name
of
the
the
congregation
answered
doubtfully
with
a
glance
at
its
prayer
books
who
hath
made
heaven
and
the
bishop
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
the
congregation
said
with
returning
confidence
henceforth
world
without
before
his
second
address
the
bishop
had
to
listen
to
veni
creator
spiritus
in
its
english
form
and
it
seemed
to
him
the
worst
of
all
possible
hymns
its
defects
became
monstrously
exaggerated
to
his
hypersensitive
mind
it
impressed
him
in
its
englished
travesty
as
a
grotesque
as
a
veritable
charlie
chaplin
among
hymns
and
in
truth
it
does
stick
out
most
awkward
feet
it
misses
its
accusatives
it
catches
absurdly
upon
points
of
abstruse
doctrine
the
great
angel
stood
motionless
and
ironical
at
the
bishop
elbow
while
it
was
being
sung
your
church
he
seemed
to
say
we
must
end
this
sort
of
thing
whispered
the
bishop
we
must
end
this
sort
of
thing
he
glanced
at
the
faces
of
the
singers
and
it
became
beyond
all
other
things
urgent
that
he
should
lift
them
once
for
all
above
the
sectarian
dogmatism
of
that
hymn
to
a
simple
vision
of
god
light
he
roused
himself
to
the
touching
business
of
the
laying
on
of
hands
while
he
did
so
the
prepared
substance
of
his
second
address
was
running
through
his
mind
the
following
prayer
and
collects
he
read
without
difficulty
and
so
came
to
his
second
address
his
disposition
at
first
was
explanatory
when
i
spoke
to
you
just
now
he
began
i
fell
unintentionally
into
the
use
of
a
greek
word
epitelesei
it
was
written
to
me
in
a
letter
from
a
friend
with
another
word
that
also
i
am
now
going
to
quote
to
you
this
letter
touched
very
closely
upon
the
things
i
want
to
say
to
you
now
and
so
these
two
words
are
very
much
in
my
mind
the
former
one
was
taken
from
the
epistle
to
the
philippians
it
signifies
will
complete
the
work
begun
the
one
i
have
now
in
mind
comes
from
the
epistle
to
the
ephesians
it
is
epiphausei
or
to
be
fuller
epiphausei
soi
ho
christos
which
signifies
that
he
will
shine
upon
us
and
this
is
very
much
in
my
thoughts
now
because
i
do
believe
that
this
world
which
seemed
so
very
far
from
god
a
little
while
ago
draws
near
now
to
an
unexampled
dawn
god
is
at
hand
it
is
your
privilege
it
is
your
grave
and
terrible
position
that
you
have
been
born
at
the
very
end
and
collapse
of
a
negligent
age
of
an
age
of
sham
kingship
sham
freedom
relaxation
evasion
greed
waste
falsehood
and
sinister
preparation
your
lives
open
out
in
the
midst
of
the
breakdown
for
which
that
age
prepared
to
you
negligence
is
no
longer
possible
there
is
cold
and
darkness
there
is
the
heat
of
the
furnace
before
you
you
will
live
amidst
extremes
such
as
our
youth
never
knew
whatever
betide
you
of
your
generation
will
have
small
chance
of
living
untempered
lives
our
country
is
at
war
and
half
mankind
is
at
war
death
and
destruction
trample
through
the
world
men
rot
and
die
by
the
million
food
diminishes
and
fails
there
is
a
wasting
away
of
all
the
hoarded
resources
of
all
the
accumulated
of
mankind
and
there
is
no
clear
prospect
yet
of
any
end
to
this
enormous
and
frightful
conflict
why
did
it
ever
arise
what
made
it
possible
it
arose
because
men
had
forgotten
god
it
was
possible
because
they
worshipped
simulacra
were
loyal
to
phantoms
of
race
and
empire
permitted
themselves
to
be
ruled
and
misled
by
idiot
princes
and
usurper
kings
their
minds
were
turned
from
god
who
alone
can
rule
and
unite
mankind
and
so
they
have
passed
from
the
glare
and
follies
of
those
former
years
into
the
darkness
and
anguish
of
the
present
day
and
in
darkness
and
anguish
they
will
remain
until
they
turn
to
that
king
who
comes
to
rule
them
until
the
sword
and
indignation
of
god
have
overthrown
their
misleaders
and
oppressors
and
the
justice
of
god
the
kingdom
of
god
set
high
over
the
republics
of
mankind
has
brought
peace
for
ever
to
the
world
it
is
to
this
militant
and
imminent
god
to
this
immortal
captain
this
undying
that
you
devote
yourselves
for
he
is
imminent
now
he
comes
i
have
seen
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
the
hearts
and
the
minds
and
the
wills
of
men
turning
to
him
as
surely
as
when
a
needle
is
magnetized
it
turns
towards
the
north
even
now
as
i
preach
to
you
here
god
stands
over
us
all
ready
to
receive
us
and
as
he
said
these
words
the
long
nave
of
the
cathedral
the
shadows
of
its
fretted
roof
the
brown
choir
with
its
golden
screen
the
rows
of
seated
figures
became
like
some
picture
cast
upon
a
flimsy
and
translucent
curtain
once
more
it
seemed
to
the
bishop
that
he
saw
god
plain
once
more
the
glorious
effulgence
poured
about
him
and
the
beautiful
and
wonderful
conquest
of
men
hearts
and
lives
was
manifest
to
him
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
cried
to
god
and
with
an
emotion
so
profound
an
earnestness
so
commanding
that
very
many
of
those
who
were
present
turned
their
faces
to
see
the
figure
to
which
he
looked
and
spoke
and
some
of
the
children
had
a
strange
persuasion
of
a
presence
there
as
of
a
divine
figure
militant
armed
and
serene
oh
god
our
leader
and
our
master
and
our
friend
the
bishop
prayed
forgive
our
imperfection
and
our
little
motives
take
us
and
make
us
one
with
thy
great
purpose
use
us
and
do
not
reject
us
make
us
all
here
servants
of
thy
kingdom
weave
our
lives
into
thy
struggle
to
conquer
and
to
bring
peace
and
union
to
the
world
we
are
small
and
feeble
creatures
we
are
feeble
in
speech
feebler
still
in
action
nevertheless
let
but
thy
light
shine
upon
us
and
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
can
not
be
lit
by
thy
fire
and
who
can
not
lose
himself
in
thy
salvation
take
us
into
thy
purpose
o
god
let
thy
kingdom
come
into
our
hearts
and
into
this
his
voice
ceased
and
he
stood
for
a
measurable
time
with
his
arms
extended
and
his
face
upturned
the
golden
clouds
that
whirled
and
eddied
so
splendidly
in
his
brain
thinned
out
his
sense
of
god
immediacy
faded
and
passed
and
he
was
left
aware
of
the
cathedral
pulpit
in
which
he
stood
so
strangely
posed
and
of
the
astonished
congregation
below
him
his
arms
sank
to
his
side
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
book
in
front
of
him
and
he
felt
for
and
gripped
the
two
upper
corners
of
it
and
regardless
of
the
common
order
and
practice
read
out
the
benediction
changing
the
words
involuntarily
as
he
read
the
blessing
of
god
who
is
the
father
the
son
the
spirit
and
the
king
of
all
mankind
be
upon
you
and
remain
with
you
for
ever
then
he
looked
again
as
if
to
look
once
more
upon
that
radiant
vision
of
god
but
now
he
saw
only
the
clear
cool
space
of
the
cathedral
vault
and
the
coloured
glass
and
tracery
of
the
great
rose
window
and
then
as
the
first
notes
of
the
organ
came
pealing
above
the
departing
stir
of
the
congregation
he
turned
about
and
descended
slowly
like
one
who
is
still
half
dreaming
from
the
pulpit
in
the
vestry
he
found
canon
bliss
help
me
to
take
off
these
garments
the
bishop
said
i
shall
never
wear
them
you
are
ill
said
the
canon
scrutinizing
his
face
not
ill
but
the
word
was
taken
out
of
my
mouth
i
perceive
now
that
i
have
been
in
a
trance
a
trance
in
which
the
truth
is
real
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
find
oneself
among
realities
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
when
god
begins
to
haunt
a
priest
i
can
never
minister
in
the
church
whippham
thrust
forward
a
chair
for
the
bishop
to
sit
down
the
bishop
felt
now
extraordinarily
fatigued
he
sat
down
heavily
and
rested
his
wrists
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
already
he
resumed
presently
i
begin
to
forget
what
it
was
i
you
became
excited
said
bliss
and
spoke
very
loudly
and
what
did
i
say
i
do
know
what
you
said
i
have
forgotten
i
never
want
to
remember
things
about
the
second
advent
dreadful
things
you
said
god
was
close
at
hand
happily
you
spoke
partly
in
greek
i
doubt
if
any
of
those
children
understood
and
you
had
a
kind
of
lapse
an
aphasia
you
mutilated
the
interrogation
and
you
did
not
pronounce
the
benediction
properly
you
changed
words
and
you
put
in
words
one
sat
frozen
waiting
for
what
would
happen
we
must
postpone
the
pringle
confirmation
said
whippham
i
wonder
to
whom
i
could
lady
ella
appeared
and
came
and
knelt
down
by
the
bishop
chair
i
never
ought
to
have
let
this
happen
she
said
taking
his
wrists
in
her
hands
you
are
in
a
fever
it
seemed
entirely
natural
to
say
what
i
did
the
bishop
declared
lady
ella
looked
up
at
bliss
a
doctor
has
been
sent
for
said
the
canon
to
lady
ella
i
must
speak
to
the
doctor
said
lady
ella
as
if
her
husband
could
not
hear
her
there
is
something
that
will
make
things
clearer
to
the
doctor
i
must
speak
to
the
doctor
for
a
moment
before
he
sees
came
a
gust
of
pretty
sounds
and
a
flash
of
bright
colour
that
shamed
the
rich
vestments
at
hand
over
the
shoulder
of
the
rector
and
quite
at
the
back
appeared
lady
sunderbund
resolutely
invading
the
vestry
the
rector
intercepted
her
stood
broad
with
extended
arms
i
must
come
in
and
speak
to
him
if
it
is
only
fo
a
the
bishop
looked
up
and
saw
lady
ella
expression
lady
ella
was
sitting
up
very
stiffly
listening
but
not
looking
round
a
vague
horror
and
a
passionate
desire
to
prevent
the
entry
of
lady
sunderbund
at
any
cost
seized
upon
the
bishop
she
would
he
felt
be
the
last
overwhelming
complication
he
descended
to
a
base
subterfuge
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
slowly
as
though
he
unfolded
himself
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
then
groaned
aloud
leave
me
alone
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
agony
leave
me
alone
i
can
see
no
one
i
can
no
there
was
a
momentous
silence
and
then
the
tumult
of
lady
sunderbund
receded
chapter
the
eighth
the
new
world
that
night
the
bishop
had
a
temperature
of
a
hundred
and
a
half
the
doctor
pronounced
him
to
be
in
a
state
of
intense
mental
excitement
aggravated
by
some
drug
he
was
a
doctor
modern
and
enough
to
admit
that
he
could
not
identify
the
drug
he
overruled
every
one
overruled
the
bishop
declaration
that
he
had
done
with
the
church
that
he
could
never
mock
god
with
his
episcopal
ministrations
again
that
he
must
proceed
at
once
with
his
resignation
do
think
of
these
things
said
the
doctor
banish
them
from
your
mind
until
your
temperature
is
down
to
then
after
a
rest
you
may
go
into
lady
ella
insisted
upon
his
keeping
his
room
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
got
her
to
admit
whippham
and
whippham
was
exasperatingly
in
order
you
need
not
trouble
about
anything
now
my
lord
he
said
everything
will
keep
until
you
are
ready
to
attend
to
it
it
well
we
through
with
easter
bishop
buncombe
of
eastern
blowdesia
was
coming
here
anyhow
and
there
is
canon
bliss
there
only
two
ordination
candidates
because
of
the
war
we
get
on
the
bishop
thought
he
would
like
to
talk
to
those
two
ordination
candidates
but
they
prevailed
upon
him
not
to
do
so
he
lay
for
the
best
part
of
one
night
confiding
remarkable
things
to
two
imaginary
ordination
candidates
he
developed
a
marked
liking
for
eleanor
company
she
was
home
again
now
after
a
visit
to
some
friends
it
was
decided
that
the
best
thing
to
do
with
him
would
be
to
send
him
away
in
her
charge
a
journey
abroad
was
impossible
france
would
remind
him
too
dreadfully
of
the
war
his
own
mind
turned
suddenly
to
the
sweet
air
of
hunstanton
he
had
gone
there
at
times
to
read
in
the
old
cambridge
days
it
is
a
terribly
ugly
place
he
said
but
it
is
wine
in
the
lady
ella
was
doubtful
about
zeppelins
thrice
they
had
been
right
over
hunstanton
already
they
came
in
by
the
easy
landmark
of
the
it
will
interest
him
said
eleanor
who
knew
her
father
better
one
warm
and
still
and
sunny
afternoon
the
bishop
found
himself
looking
out
upon
the
waters
of
the
wash
he
sat
where
the
highest
pebble
layers
of
the
beach
reached
up
to
a
little
cliff
of
sandy
earth
perhaps
a
foot
high
and
he
looked
upon
sands
and
sea
and
sky
and
saw
that
they
were
beautiful
he
was
a
little
object
in
a
scene
of
the
most
exquisite
and
delicate
colour
right
and
left
of
him
stretched
the
low
grey
salted
shore
pale
banks
of
marly
earth
surmounted
by
wiry
grass
that
held
and
was
half
buried
in
fine
blown
sand
above
the
heavens
made
a
complete
hemisphere
of
blue
in
which
a
series
of
remote
cumulus
clouds
floated
and
dissolved
before
him
spread
the
long
levels
of
the
sands
and
far
away
at
its
utmost
ebb
was
the
sea
eleanor
had
gone
to
explore
the
black
ribs
of
a
wrecked
that
lay
at
the
edge
of
a
shallow
lagoon
she
was
a
little
figure
very
bright
and
apparently
transparent
she
had
reverted
for
a
time
to
shameless
childishness
she
had
hidden
her
stockings
among
the
reeds
of
the
bank
and
she
was
running
to
and
fro
from
to
razor
shell
and
from
cockle
to
weed
the
shingle
was
pale
drab
and
purple
close
at
hand
but
to
the
westward
towards
hunstanton
the
sands
became
brown
and
purple
and
were
presently
broken
up
into
endless
skerries
of
low
flat
boulders
and
little
intensely
blue
pools
the
sea
was
a
band
of
sapphire
that
became
silver
to
the
west
it
met
the
silver
shining
sands
in
one
delicate
breathing
edge
of
intensely
white
foam
remote
to
the
west
very
small
and
black
and
clear
against
the
afternoon
sky
was
a
cart
and
about
it
was
a
score
or
so
of
a
little
nearer
on
an
apparently
empty
stretch
of
shining
wet
sand
a
multitude
of
gulls
was
mysteriously
busy
these
two
groups
of
activities
and
eleanor
flitting
translucent
movements
did
but
set
off
and
emphasize
the
immense
and
soothing
tranquillity
for
a
long
time
the
bishop
sat
passively
receptive
to
this
healing
beauty
then
a
little
flow
of
thought
began
and
gathered
in
his
mind
he
had
come
out
to
think
over
two
letters
that
he
had
brought
with
him
he
drew
these
now
rather
reluctantly
from
his
pocket
and
after
a
long
pause
over
the
envelopes
began
to
read
them
he
reread
likeman
letter
first
likeman
could
not
forgive
him
my
dear
scrope
he
wrote
your
explanation
explains
nothing
this
sensational
declaration
of
infidelity
to
our
mother
church
made
under
the
most
damning
and
distressing
circumstances
in
the
presence
of
young
and
tender
minds
entrusted
to
your
ministrations
and
in
defiance
of
the
honourable
engagements
implied
in
the
confirmation
service
confirms
my
worst
apprehensions
of
the
weaknesses
of
your
character
i
have
always
felt
the
touch
of
theatricality
in
your
temperament
the
peculiar
craving
to
be
than
us
all
the
need
of
personal
excitement
i
know
that
you
were
never
quite
contented
to
believe
in
god
at
you
wanted
to
be
taken
notice
of
personally
except
for
some
few
hints
to
you
i
have
never
breathed
a
word
of
these
doubts
to
any
human
being
i
have
always
hoped
that
the
ripening
that
comes
with
years
and
experience
would
give
you
an
increasing
strength
against
the
dangers
of
emotionalism
and
against
your
strong
deep
quiet
sense
of
your
exceptional
personal
importance
the
bishop
read
thus
far
and
then
sat
reflecting
was
it
just
he
had
many
weaknesses
but
had
he
this
egotism
no
that
the
justice
of
the
case
the
old
man
bitterly
disappointed
was
endeavouring
to
wound
scrope
asked
himself
whether
he
was
to
blame
for
that
disappointment
that
was
a
more
difficult
question
he
dismissed
the
charge
at
last
crumpled
up
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
flung
it
away
but
he
remained
acutely
sorry
not
so
much
for
himself
as
for
the
revelation
of
likeman
this
letter
made
he
had
had
a
great
affection
for
likeman
and
suddenly
it
was
turned
into
a
wound
the
second
letter
was
from
lady
sunderbund
and
it
was
an
altogether
more
remarkable
document
lady
sunderbund
wrote
on
a
notepaper
that
was
evidently
the
result
of
a
perverse
research
but
she
wrote
a
letter
far
more
coherent
than
her
speech
and
without
that
curious
falling
away
of
the
r
that
flavoured
even
her
gravest
observations
with
an
unjust
faint
aroma
of
absurdity
she
wrote
with
a
thin
pen
in
a
rounded
boyish
handwriting
she
italicized
with
slashes
of
the
pen
he
held
this
letter
in
both
hands
between
his
knees
and
considered
it
now
with
an
expression
that
brought
his
eyebrows
forward
until
they
almost
met
and
that
tucked
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
my
dear
bishop
it
began
i
keep
thinking
and
thinking
and
thinking
of
that
wonderful
service
of
the
wonderful
wonderful
things
you
said
and
the
wonderful
choice
you
made
of
the
moment
to
say
them
when
all
those
young
lives
were
coming
to
the
great
serious
thing
in
life
it
was
most
beautifully
done
at
any
rate
dear
bishop
and
teacher
it
was
most
beautifully
begun
and
now
we
all
stand
to
you
like
creditors
because
you
have
given
us
so
much
that
you
owe
us
ever
so
much
more
you
have
started
us
and
you
have
to
go
on
with
us
you
have
broken
the
shell
of
the
old
church
and
here
we
are
running
about
with
nowhere
to
go
you
have
to
make
the
shelter
of
a
new
church
now
for
us
purged
of
errors
looking
straight
to
god
the
king
of
mankind
what
a
wonderful
wonderful
phrase
that
is
it
says
everything
tell
us
more
of
him
and
more
count
me
first
not
foremost
but
just
the
little
one
that
runs
in
first
among
your
disciples
they
say
you
are
resigning
your
position
in
the
church
of
course
that
must
be
true
you
are
coming
out
of
it
what
did
you
call
it
coming
out
of
the
cracked
old
vessel
from
which
you
have
poured
the
living
waters
i
called
on
lady
ella
yesterday
she
did
not
tell
me
very
much
i
think
she
is
a
very
reserved
as
well
as
a
very
dignified
woman
but
she
said
that
you
intended
to
go
to
london
in
london
then
i
suppose
you
will
set
up
the
first
altar
to
the
divine
king
i
want
to
help
dear
bishop
and
teacher
i
want
to
help
tremendously
with
all
my
heart
and
all
my
soul
i
want
to
be
let
do
things
for
the
you
was
erased
by
three
or
four
rapid
slashes
and
our
king
substituted
i
want
to
be
privileged
to
help
build
that
first
church
of
the
world
unified
under
god
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
says
but
you
see
i
am
very
rich
this
dreadful
war
has
made
me
ever
so
much
richer
steel
and
shipping
and
things
it
is
my
trustees
have
done
it
i
am
ashamed
to
be
so
rich
i
want
to
give
i
want
to
give
and
help
this
great
beginning
of
yours
i
want
you
to
let
me
help
on
the
temporal
side
to
make
it
easy
for
you
to
stand
forth
and
deliver
your
message
amidst
suitable
surroundings
and
without
any
horrid
worries
on
account
of
the
sacrifices
you
have
made
please
do
not
turn
my
offering
aside
i
have
never
wanted
anything
so
much
in
all
my
life
as
i
want
to
make
this
gift
unless
i
can
make
it
i
feel
that
for
me
there
is
no
salvation
i
shall
stick
with
my
loads
and
loads
of
stocks
and
shares
and
horrid
possessions
outside
the
needle
eye
but
if
i
could
build
a
temple
for
god
and
just
live
somewhere
near
it
so
as
to
be
the
poor
woman
who
sweeps
out
the
chapels
and
die
perhaps
and
be
buried
under
its
floor
do
smile
at
me
i
mean
every
word
of
it
years
ago
i
thought
of
such
a
thing
after
i
had
visited
the
certosa
di
pavia
do
you
know
it
so
beautiful
and
those
two
still
alabaster
figures
recumbent
but
until
now
i
could
never
see
my
way
to
any
such
service
now
i
do
i
am
all
afire
to
do
it
help
me
tell
me
let
me
stand
behind
you
and
make
your
mission
possible
i
feel
i
have
come
to
the
most
wonderful
phase
in
my
life
i
feel
my
call
has
come
i
have
written
this
letter
over
three
times
and
torn
each
of
them
up
i
do
so
want
to
say
all
this
and
it
is
so
desperately
hard
to
say
i
am
full
of
fears
that
you
despise
me
i
know
there
is
a
sort
of
high
colour
about
me
my
passion
for
brightness
i
am
absurd
but
inside
of
me
is
a
soul
a
real
living
breathing
soul
crying
out
to
you
let
me
help
let
me
help
i
will
do
anything
i
will
endure
anything
if
only
i
can
keep
hold
of
the
vision
splendid
you
gave
me
in
the
cathedral
i
see
it
now
day
and
night
the
dream
of
the
place
i
can
make
for
you
and
you
preaching
my
fingers
itch
to
begin
the
day
before
yesterday
i
said
to
myself
am
quite
unworthy
i
am
a
worldly
woman
a
rich
smart
decorated
woman
he
will
never
accept
me
as
i
am
i
took
off
all
my
jewels
every
one
i
looked
through
all
my
clothes
and
at
last
i
decided
i
would
have
made
for
me
a
very
simple
straight
grey
dress
just
simple
and
straight
and
grey
perhaps
you
will
think
that
too
is
absurd
of
me
too
i
would
not
tell
of
it
to
you
if
i
did
not
want
you
to
understand
how
alive
i
am
to
my
utter
impossibilities
how
resolved
i
am
to
do
anything
so
that
i
may
be
able
to
serve
but
never
mind
about
silly
me
let
me
tell
you
how
i
see
the
new
church
i
think
you
ought
to
have
some
place
near
the
centre
of
london
not
too
west
for
you
might
easily
become
fashionable
not
too
east
because
you
might
easily
be
swallowed
up
in
merely
philanthropic
work
but
somewhere
between
the
two
there
must
be
vacant
sites
still
to
be
got
round
about
kingsway
and
there
we
must
set
up
your
tabernacle
a
very
plain
very
simple
very
beautifully
proportioned
building
in
which
you
can
give
your
message
i
know
a
young
man
just
the
very
young
man
to
do
something
of
the
sort
something
quite
new
quite
modern
and
yet
solemn
and
serious
lady
ella
seemed
to
think
you
wanted
to
live
somewhere
in
the
of
london
but
she
would
tell
me
very
little
i
seem
to
see
you
not
there
at
all
not
in
anything
between
and
suburb
but
yourself
as
central
as
your
mind
in
a
kind
of
clergy
house
that
will
be
part
of
the
building
that
is
how
it
is
in
my
dream
anyhow
all
that
though
can
be
settled
afterwards
my
imagination
and
my
desire
is
running
away
with
me
it
is
no
time
yet
for
premature
plans
not
that
i
am
not
planning
day
and
night
this
letter
is
simply
to
offer
i
just
want
to
offer
here
i
am
and
all
my
worldly
goods
take
me
i
pray
you
and
not
only
pray
you
take
me
i
demand
of
you
in
the
name
of
god
our
king
i
have
a
right
to
be
used
and
you
have
no
right
to
refuse
me
you
have
to
go
on
with
your
message
and
it
is
your
duty
to
take
me
just
as
you
are
obliged
to
step
on
any
steppingstone
that
lies
on
your
way
to
do
god
service
and
so
i
am
waiting
i
shall
be
waiting
on
thorns
i
know
you
will
take
your
time
and
think
but
do
not
take
too
much
time
think
of
me
waiting
your
servant
your
most
humble
helper
in
god
your
god
agatha
and
then
scrawled
along
the
margin
of
the
last
sheet
if
when
you
know
a
telegram
even
if
you
can
not
say
so
much
as
still
such
a
word
as
i
just
hang
over
the
void
until
i
hear
agatha
a
letter
demanding
enormous
deliberation
she
argued
closely
in
spite
of
her
italics
it
had
never
dawned
upon
the
bishop
before
how
light
is
the
servitude
of
the
disciple
in
comparison
with
the
servitude
of
the
master
in
many
ways
this
proposal
repelled
and
troubled
him
in
many
ways
it
attracted
him
and
the
argument
of
his
clear
obligation
to
accept
her
gripped
him
it
was
a
good
argument
and
besides
it
worked
in
very
conveniently
with
certain
other
difficulties
that
perplexed
him
the
bishop
became
aware
that
eleanor
was
returning
to
him
across
the
sands
she
had
made
an
end
to
her
paddling
she
had
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
become
once
more
the
grave
and
responsible
young
woman
who
had
been
taking
care
of
him
since
his
flight
from
princhester
he
replaced
the
two
letters
in
his
pocket
and
sat
ready
to
smile
as
she
drew
near
he
admired
her
open
brow
the
toss
of
her
hair
and
the
poise
of
her
head
upon
her
neck
it
was
good
to
note
that
her
hard
reading
at
cambridge
had
bent
her
shoulders
in
the
least
well
old
dad
she
said
as
she
drew
near
you
got
back
a
i
got
back
everything
it
time
i
returned
to
not
in
this
weather
not
for
a
day
or
she
flung
herself
at
his
feet
consider
your
overworked
little
daughter
oh
how
good
this
is
no
said
the
bishop
in
a
grave
tone
that
made
her
look
up
into
his
face
i
must
go
he
met
her
clear
gaze
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
business
eleanor
he
asked
abruptly
do
you
think
i
had
a
sort
of
fit
in
the
cathedral
he
winced
as
he
asked
the
question
daddy
she
said
after
a
little
pause
the
things
you
said
and
did
that
afternoon
were
the
noblest
you
ever
did
in
your
life
i
wish
i
had
been
there
it
must
have
been
splendid
to
be
there
i
not
told
you
before
i
been
dying
to
i
promised
not
to
say
a
word
not
to
remind
you
i
promised
the
doctor
but
now
you
ask
me
now
you
are
well
again
i
can
tell
you
kitty
kingdom
has
told
me
all
about
it
how
it
felt
it
was
like
light
and
order
coming
into
a
hopeless
dark
muddle
what
you
said
was
like
what
we
have
all
been
trying
to
think
i
mean
all
of
us
young
people
suddenly
it
was
all
she
stopped
short
she
was
breathless
with
the
excitement
of
her
confession
her
father
too
remained
silent
for
a
little
while
he
was
reminded
of
his
weakness
he
was
he
perceived
still
a
little
hysterical
he
felt
that
he
might
weep
at
her
youthful
enthusiasm
if
he
did
not
restrain
himself
i
glad
he
said
and
patted
her
shoulder
i
glad
she
looked
away
from
him
out
across
the
lank
brown
sands
and
water
pools
to
the
sea
it
was
what
we
have
all
been
feeling
our
way
towards
the
absolute
simplification
of
religion
the
absolute
simplification
of
politics
and
social
duty
just
god
just
god
the
but
should
i
have
said
that
in
the
cathedral
she
felt
no
scruples
you
had
to
she
said
but
now
think
what
it
means
he
said
i
must
leave
the
as
a
man
strips
off
his
coat
for
a
that
does
dismay
you
she
shook
her
head
and
smiled
confidently
to
sea
and
sky
i
glad
if
you
with
me
he
said
sometimes
i
think
i
not
a
very
you
have
all
the
world
with
you
she
was
convinced
in
a
little
perhaps
rather
a
longer
time
than
you
think
norah
in
the
meantime
she
turned
to
him
once
more
in
the
meantime
there
are
a
great
many
things
to
consider
young
people
they
say
never
think
of
the
transport
that
is
needed
to
win
a
battle
i
have
it
in
my
mind
that
i
should
leave
the
church
but
i
just
walk
out
into
the
marketplace
and
begin
preaching
there
i
see
the
family
furniture
being
carried
out
of
the
palace
and
put
into
vans
it
has
to
go
somewhere
i
suppose
you
will
go
to
possibly
in
fact
certainly
i
have
a
plan
or
at
least
an
opportunity
but
that
is
what
i
have
most
in
mind
these
things
are
not
done
without
emotion
and
a
considerable
strain
upon
personal
relationships
i
do
not
think
this
i
do
not
think
your
mother
sees
things
as
we
she
will
said
young
enthusiasm
when
she
i
wish
she
did
but
i
have
been
unlucky
in
the
circumstances
of
my
explanations
to
her
and
of
course
you
understand
all
this
means
risks
poverty
perhaps
going
without
things
travel
opportunity
nice
possessions
for
all
of
us
a
loss
of
position
too
all
this
sort
of
thing
he
stuck
out
a
gaitered
calf
and
smiled
will
have
to
go
people
some
of
them
may
be
disasagreeable
to
us
after
all
daddy
she
said
smiling
it
is
so
bad
as
the
cross
and
the
lions
and
burning
pitch
and
you
have
the
you
do
believe
he
left
his
sentence
unfinished
she
nodded
her
face
aglow
we
know
you
have
the
of
course
in
my
own
mind
now
it
is
very
clear
i
had
a
kind
of
illumination
he
would
have
tried
to
tell
her
of
his
vision
and
he
was
too
shy
it
came
to
me
suddenly
that
the
whole
world
was
in
confusion
because
men
followed
after
a
thousand
different
immediate
aims
when
really
it
was
quite
easy
if
only
one
could
be
simple
it
was
quite
easy
to
show
that
nearly
all
men
could
only
be
fully
satisfied
and
made
happy
in
themselves
by
one
single
aim
which
was
also
the
aim
that
would
make
the
whole
world
one
great
order
and
that
aim
was
to
make
god
king
of
one
heart
and
the
whole
world
i
saw
that
all
this
world
except
for
a
few
base
monstrous
spirits
was
suffering
hideous
things
because
of
this
war
and
before
the
war
it
was
full
of
folly
waste
social
injustice
and
suspicion
for
the
same
reason
because
it
had
not
realized
the
kingship
of
god
and
that
is
so
simple
the
essence
of
god
is
simplicity
the
sin
of
this
war
lies
with
men
like
myself
men
who
set
up
to
tell
people
about
god
more
than
it
lies
with
any
other
class
kings
she
interjected
diplomatists
finance
yes
those
men
could
only
work
mischief
in
the
world
because
the
priests
and
teachers
let
them
all
things
human
lie
at
last
at
the
door
of
the
priest
and
teacher
who
differentiate
who
qualify
and
complicate
who
make
mean
unnecessary
elaborations
and
so
divide
mankind
if
it
were
not
for
the
weakness
and
wickedness
of
the
priests
every
one
would
know
and
understand
god
every
one
who
was
modest
enough
not
to
set
up
for
particular
knowledge
men
disputed
whether
god
is
finite
or
infinite
whether
he
has
a
triple
or
a
single
aspect
how
should
they
know
all
we
need
to
know
is
the
face
he
turns
to
us
they
impose
their
horrible
creeds
and
distinctions
none
of
those
things
matter
call
him
christ
the
god
or
call
him
simply
god
allah
heaven
it
does
not
matter
he
comes
to
us
we
know
like
a
helper
and
friend
that
is
all
we
want
to
know
you
may
speculate
further
if
you
like
but
it
is
not
religion
they
dispute
whether
he
can
set
aside
nature
but
that
is
superstition
he
is
either
master
of
nature
and
he
knows
that
it
is
good
or
he
is
part
of
nature
and
must
obey
that
is
an
argument
for
metaphysicians
either
answer
means
the
same
for
us
it
does
not
matter
which
way
we
come
to
believe
that
he
does
not
idly
set
the
course
of
things
aside
obviously
he
does
not
set
the
course
of
things
aside
what
he
does
do
for
certain
is
to
give
us
courage
and
save
us
from
our
selfishness
and
the
bitter
hell
it
makes
for
us
and
every
one
knows
too
what
sort
of
things
we
want
and
for
what
end
we
want
to
escape
from
ourselves
we
want
to
do
right
and
right
if
you
think
clearly
is
just
truth
within
and
service
without
the
service
of
kingdom
which
is
mankind
the
service
of
human
needs
and
the
increase
of
human
power
and
experience
it
is
all
perfectly
plain
it
is
all
quite
easy
for
any
one
to
understand
who
is
misled
and
chattered
at
and
threatened
and
poisoned
by
evil
priests
and
and
you
are
going
to
preach
that
daddy
if
i
can
when
i
am
free
you
know
i
have
still
to
resign
and
give
up
i
shall
make
that
my
and
so
god
god
comes
as
men
perceive
him
in
his
simplicity
let
men
but
see
god
simply
and
forthwith
god
and
his
kingdom
possess
the
she
looked
out
to
sea
in
silence
for
awhile
then
she
turned
to
her
father
and
you
think
that
his
kingdom
will
come
perhaps
in
quite
a
little
time
perhaps
in
our
lifetimes
and
that
all
these
ridiculous
or
wicked
little
kings
and
emperors
and
these
political
parties
and
these
policies
and
conspiracies
and
this
nationalist
nonsense
and
all
the
patriotism
and
rowdyism
all
the
private
and
every
baseness
in
life
all
the
things
that
it
is
so
horrible
and
disgusting
to
be
young
among
and
powerless
among
you
think
they
will
fade
before
him
the
bishop
pulled
his
faith
together
they
will
fade
before
him
but
whether
it
will
take
a
lifetime
or
a
hundred
lifetimes
or
a
thousand
lifetimes
my
norah
he
smiled
and
left
his
sentence
unfinished
and
she
smiled
back
at
him
to
show
she
understood
and
then
he
confessed
further
because
he
did
not
want
to
seem
merely
sentimentally
hopeful
when
i
was
in
the
cathedral
norah
and
just
before
that
service
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
very
real
it
seemed
that
perhaps
the
kingdom
of
god
is
nearer
than
we
suppose
that
it
needs
but
the
faith
and
courage
of
a
few
and
it
may
be
that
we
may
even
live
to
see
the
dawning
of
his
kingdom
even
who
knows
the
sunrise
i
am
so
full
of
faith
and
hope
that
i
fear
to
be
hopeful
with
you
but
whether
it
is
near
or
far
we
work
for
it
said
eleanor
eleanor
thought
eyes
downcast
for
a
little
while
and
then
looked
up
it
is
so
wonderful
to
talk
to
you
like
this
daddy
in
the
old
days
i
did
dream
before
i
went
to
newnham
i
misjudged
you
i
thought
never
mind
what
i
thought
it
was
silly
but
now
i
am
so
proud
of
you
and
so
happy
to
be
back
with
you
daddy
and
find
that
your
religion
is
after
all
just
the
same
religion
that
i
have
been
chapter
the
ninth
the
third
vision
one
afternoon
in
october
four
months
and
more
after
that
previous
conversation
the
card
of
edward
scrope
was
brought
up
to
the
name
awakened
no
memories
the
doctor
descended
to
discover
a
man
so
obviously
in
unaccustomed
plain
clothes
that
he
had
a
momentary
disagreeable
idea
that
he
was
facing
a
detective
then
he
saw
that
this
secular
disguise
draped
the
familiar
form
of
his
old
friend
the
former
bishop
of
princhester
scrope
was
pale
and
a
little
untidy
he
had
already
acquired
something
of
the
peculiar
slightly
faded
quality
one
finds
in
a
don
who
has
gone
to
hampstead
and
fallen
amongst
advanced
thinkers
and
got
mixed
up
with
the
fabian
society
his
anxious
eyes
and
faintly
propitiatory
manner
suggested
an
impending
appeal
had
the
of
a
successful
consultant
he
prided
himself
on
being
all
things
to
all
men
but
just
for
an
instant
he
was
at
a
loss
what
sort
of
thing
he
had
to
be
here
then
he
adopted
the
genial
kindly
but
by
no
means
lavishly
generous
tone
advisable
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
has
suffered
considerable
social
deterioration
without
being
very
seriously
to
blame
was
a
little
man
with
defective
eyesight
and
an
unsuitable
nose
for
the
glasses
he
wore
and
he
flaunted
god
knows
why
enormous
well
he
said
balancing
the
glasses
skilfully
by
throwing
back
his
head
and
how
are
you
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
there
no
external
evidence
of
trouble
you
looking
lean
and
a
little
pale
but
thoroughly
yes
said
the
late
bishop
i
fairly
fit
only
said
the
doctor
smiling
his
teeth
with
something
of
the
manner
of
an
old
bathing
woman
who
tells
a
child
to
jump
well
i
run
down
and
we
better
sit
down
said
the
great
doctor
professionally
and
looked
hard
at
him
then
he
pulled
at
the
arm
of
a
chair
the
sat
down
and
the
doctor
placed
himself
between
his
patient
and
the
light
this
business
of
resigning
my
bishopric
and
so
forth
has
involved
very
considerable
strains
scrope
began
that
i
think
is
the
essence
of
the
trouble
one
cuts
so
many
associations
i
did
not
realize
how
much
feeling
there
would
be
difficulties
too
of
readjusting
zactly
zactly
zactly
said
the
doctor
snapping
his
face
and
making
his
glasses
vibrate
run
down
want
a
tonic
or
a
change
yes
in
fact
i
want
a
particular
made
his
eyes
and
mouth
round
and
interrogative
while
you
were
away
last
spring
had
to
go
said
the
doctor
unavoidable
gas
gangrene
certain
enquiries
these
young
investigators
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
we
older
reputations
experience
maturity
of
judgment
ca
do
without
us
yes
well
i
came
here
last
spring
and
saw
an
assistant
i
suppose
he
was
or
a
supply
do
you
call
them
supplies
in
your
profession
named
i
think
let
me
see
d
dale
the
doctor
as
he
uttered
this
word
set
his
face
to
the
unaccustomed
exercise
of
expressing
malignity
his
round
blue
eyes
sought
to
blaze
small
cherubic
muscles
exerted
themselves
to
pucker
his
brows
his
colour
became
a
violent
pink
lunatic
he
said
dangerous
lunatic
he
did
do
anything
anything
bad
in
your
case
did
he
he
was
evidently
highly
charged
with
grievance
in
this
matter
that
man
was
sent
to
me
from
cambridge
with
the
highest
testimonials
the
very
highest
i
had
to
go
at
hours
notice
enquiry
gas
gangrene
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
leave
things
in
his
disavowed
responsibility
with
an
open
hand
he
did
me
no
particular
harm
said
scrope
you
are
the
first
he
spared
said
did
he
was
he
unskilful
unskilful
is
hardly
the
were
his
methods
peculiar
the
little
doctor
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
about
the
room
peculiar
he
said
it
was
abominable
that
they
should
send
him
to
me
abominable
he
turned
with
all
the
round
knobs
that
constituted
his
face
aglow
his
waved
apart
like
wings
about
to
flap
he
protruded
his
face
towards
his
seated
patient
i
am
glad
that
he
has
been
killed
he
said
glad
there
his
glasses
fell
off
shocked
beyond
measure
he
did
not
heed
them
they
swung
about
in
front
of
him
as
if
they
sought
to
escape
while
he
poured
out
his
feelings
fool
he
spluttered
with
demonstrative
gestures
dangerous
fool
his
one
idea
to
upset
everybody
drugs
sir
the
most
terrible
drugs
i
come
back
find
ladies
high
social
position
others
reckless
use
of
the
most
dangerous
expedients
cocaine
not
in
it
stimulants
violent
stimulants
in
the
highest
quarters
terrible
exalted
persons
royalty
anxious
to
be
given
war
work
and
become
anonymous
horrible
he
been
a
terrible
influence
one
idea
to
disturb
soul
and
body
minds
unhinged
personal
relations
deranged
shattered
the
practice
of
years
the
harm
he
has
done
the
harm
he
looked
as
though
he
was
trying
to
burst
as
a
final
expression
of
wrath
he
failed
his
hands
felt
trembling
to
recover
his
then
from
his
tail
pocket
he
produced
a
large
silk
handkerchief
and
wiped
the
glasses
replaced
them
wriggled
his
head
in
his
collar
running
his
fingers
round
his
neck
patted
his
tie
excuse
this
outbreak
he
said
but
dale
has
inflicted
injuries
scrope
got
up
walked
slowly
to
the
window
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
turned
his
manner
still
retained
much
of
his
episcopal
dignity
i
am
sorry
but
still
you
can
no
doubt
tell
from
your
books
what
it
was
he
gave
me
it
was
a
tonic
that
had
a
very
great
effect
on
me
and
i
need
it
badly
was
quietly
malignant
he
kept
no
diary
at
all
he
said
no
diary
at
but
if
he
did
said
holding
up
a
flat
hand
and
wagging
it
from
side
to
side
i
would
follow
his
he
intensified
with
the
hand
going
faster
i
would
follow
his
treatment
not
under
any
naturally
said
scrope
if
the
results
are
what
you
say
but
in
my
case
it
was
a
treatment
i
was
sleepless
confused
in
my
mind
wretched
and
demoralized
i
came
here
and
he
just
produced
the
stuff
it
clears
the
head
it
clears
the
mind
one
seems
to
get
away
from
the
cloud
of
things
to
get
through
to
essentials
and
fundamentals
it
straightened
me
out
you
must
know
such
a
stuff
just
now
confronted
with
all
sorts
of
problems
arising
out
of
my
resignation
i
want
that
tonic
effect
again
i
must
have
it
i
have
matters
to
decide
and
i
ca
decide
i
find
myself
uncertain
changeable
from
hour
to
hour
i
do
ask
you
to
take
up
anything
of
this
man
dale
this
is
a
new
occasion
but
i
want
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
speech
hands
had
fallen
to
his
hips
as
scrope
went
on
the
doctor
pose
had
stiffened
his
head
had
gone
a
little
on
one
side
he
had
begun
to
play
with
his
glasses
at
the
end
he
gave
vent
to
one
or
two
short
coughs
and
then
pointed
his
words
with
his
glasses
held
out
tell
me
he
said
tell
cough
had
this
drug
that
cleared
your
head
anything
to
do
with
your
resignation
and
he
put
on
his
glasses
disconcertingly
and
threw
his
head
back
to
watch
the
reply
it
did
help
to
clear
up
the
exactly
said
in
a
tone
that
defined
his
own
position
with
remorseless
clearness
and
he
held
up
a
flat
arresting
hand
my
dear
sir
he
said
how
can
you
expect
me
to
help
you
to
a
drug
so
disastrous
even
if
i
could
tell
you
what
it
but
it
was
not
disastrous
to
me
said
scrope
your
extraordinary
resignation
your
still
more
extraordinary
way
of
proclaiming
it
i
do
think
those
were
but
my
dear
sir
you
do
want
to
discuss
theology
with
me
i
know
so
let
me
tell
you
simply
that
from
my
point
of
view
the
illumination
that
came
to
me
this
drug
of
dale
helping
has
been
the
great
release
of
my
life
it
crystallized
my
mind
it
swept
aside
the
confusing
commonplace
things
about
me
just
for
a
time
i
saw
truth
clearly
i
want
to
do
so
why
there
is
a
crisis
in
my
affairs
never
mind
what
but
i
can
not
see
my
way
was
meditating
now
with
his
eyes
on
his
carpet
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
tucked
in
he
was
swinging
his
glasses
tell
me
he
said
looking
sideways
at
scrope
what
were
the
effects
of
this
drug
it
may
have
been
anything
how
did
it
give
you
this
this
vision
of
the
truth
that
led
to
your
resignation
scrope
felt
a
sudden
shyness
but
he
wanted
dale
drug
again
so
badly
that
he
obliged
himself
to
describe
his
previous
experiences
to
the
best
of
his
ability
it
was
he
said
in
a
tone
a
golden
transparent
liquid
very
golden
like
a
chablis
when
water
was
added
it
became
streaked
and
opalescent
with
a
kind
of
living
quiver
in
it
i
held
it
up
to
the
yes
and
when
you
took
it
i
felt
suddenly
clearer
my
mind
i
had
a
kind
of
exaltation
and
your
mind
assisted
began
to
go
to
the
it
felt
stronger
and
clearer
said
scrope
sticking
to
his
quest
and
did
things
look
as
usual
asked
the
doctor
protruding
his
knobby
little
face
like
a
clenched
fist
no
said
scrope
and
regarded
him
how
much
was
it
possible
to
tell
a
man
of
this
type
they
differed
said
the
doctor
relaxing
yes
well
to
be
plain
i
had
an
immediate
sense
of
god
i
saw
the
world
as
if
it
were
a
transparent
curtain
and
then
god
became
evident
is
it
possible
for
that
to
determine
the
drug
god
became
evident
the
doctor
said
with
some
distaste
and
shook
his
head
slowly
then
in
a
sudden
sharp
tone
you
mean
you
had
a
vision
actually
saw
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
scrope
was
now
mentally
very
uncomfortable
indeed
the
doctor
lips
repeated
these
words
noiselessly
with
an
effect
of
contempt
he
must
have
given
you
something
it
a
little
like
morphia
but
golden
opalescent
and
it
was
this
vision
made
you
astonish
us
all
with
your
resignation
that
was
part
of
a
larger
process
said
scrope
patiently
i
had
been
drifting
into
a
complete
repudiation
of
the
anglican
positions
long
before
that
all
that
this
drug
did
was
to
make
clear
what
was
already
in
my
mind
and
give
it
value
act
as
a
the
doctor
suddenly
gave
way
to
a
botryoidal
hilarity
to
think
that
one
should
be
consulted
about
visions
of
god
in
mount
street
he
said
and
you
know
you
know
you
half
want
to
believe
that
vision
was
real
you
know
you
so
far
scrope
had
been
resisting
his
realization
of
failure
now
he
gave
way
to
an
exasperation
that
made
him
reckless
of
opinion
i
do
think
he
said
that
that
drug
did
in
some
way
make
god
real
to
me
i
think
i
saw
shook
his
head
in
a
way
that
made
scrope
want
to
hit
him
i
think
i
saw
god
he
repeated
more
firmly
i
had
a
sudden
realization
of
how
great
he
was
and
how
great
life
was
and
how
timid
and
mean
and
sordid
were
all
our
genteel
professional
lives
i
was
seized
upon
for
a
time
i
was
altogether
possessed
by
a
passion
to
serve
him
fitly
and
recklessly
to
make
an
end
to
compromises
with
comfort
and
and
secondary
things
and
i
want
to
hold
to
that
i
want
to
get
back
to
that
i
am
given
to
lassitudes
i
relax
i
am
by
temperament
an
man
i
want
to
buck
myself
up
i
want
to
get
on
with
my
larger
purposes
and
i
find
myself
tired
muddled
entangled
the
drug
was
a
good
thing
for
me
it
was
a
good
thing
i
want
its
help
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
what
it
are
there
no
other
drugs
that
you
do
know
that
have
a
kindred
effect
if
for
example
i
tried
morphia
in
some
form
you
get
visions
they
would
be
divine
visions
if
you
took
small
quantities
very
discreetly
you
might
get
a
temporary
quickening
but
the
swift
result
of
all
repeated
is
i
can
assure
you
moral
decay
rapid
moral
decay
to
touch
drugs
habitually
is
to
become
hopelessly
unpunctual
untruthful
callously
selfish
and
insincere
i
am
talking
mere
textbook
mere
everyday
to
you
when
i
tell
you
i
had
an
idea
i
had
a
hope
you
a
stiff
enough
fight
before
you
said
the
doctor
without
such
a
handicap
as
you
wo
help
me
the
doctor
walked
up
and
down
his
hearthrug
and
then
delivered
himself
with
an
extended
hand
and
waggling
fingers
i
would
if
i
could
for
your
good
i
would
and
even
if
i
would
i
could
for
i
do
know
the
drug
one
of
his
infernal
brews
no
doubt
something
accidental
it
lost
for
good
for
your
good
anyhow
scrope
halted
outside
the
stucco
portals
of
the
doctor
house
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
turn
to
the
east
or
the
west
that
door
closes
he
said
there
no
getting
back
that
he
stood
for
a
time
on
the
kerb
he
turned
at
last
towards
park
lane
and
hyde
park
he
walked
along
thoughtfully
inattentively
steering
a
course
for
his
new
home
in
pembury
road
notting
hill
at
the
outset
of
this
new
phase
in
scrope
life
that
had
followed
the
crisis
of
the
confirmation
service
everything
had
seemed
very
clear
before
him
he
believed
firmly
that
he
had
been
shown
god
that
he
had
himself
stood
in
the
presence
of
god
and
that
there
had
been
a
plain
call
to
him
to
proclaim
god
to
the
world
he
had
realized
god
and
it
was
the
task
of
every
one
who
had
realized
god
to
help
all
mankind
to
the
same
realization
the
proposal
of
lady
sunderbund
had
fallen
in
with
that
idea
he
had
been
steeling
himself
to
a
prospect
of
struggle
and
dire
poverty
but
her
prompt
loyalty
had
come
as
an
immense
relief
to
his
anxiety
for
his
wife
and
family
when
he
had
talked
to
eleanor
upon
the
beach
at
hunstanton
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
his
course
was
manifest
perhaps
a
little
severe
but
by
no
means
impossible
they
had
sat
together
in
the
sunshine
exalted
by
a
sense
of
fine
adventure
and
confident
of
success
they
had
looked
out
upon
the
future
upon
the
great
near
future
in
which
the
idea
of
god
was
to
inspire
and
reconstruct
the
world
it
was
only
very
slowly
that
this
pristine
clearness
became
clouded
and
confused
it
had
not
been
so
easy
as
eleanor
had
supposed
to
win
over
the
sympathy
of
lady
ella
with
his
resignation
indeed
it
had
not
been
won
over
she
had
become
a
stern
and
chilling
companion
mute
now
upon
the
issue
of
his
resignation
but
manifestly
resentful
he
was
secretly
disappointed
and
disconcerted
by
her
tone
and
the
same
hesitation
of
the
mind
instinctive
rather
than
reasoned
that
had
prevented
a
frank
explanation
of
his
earlier
doubts
to
her
now
restrained
him
from
telling
her
naturally
and
at
once
of
the
part
that
lady
sunderbund
was
to
play
in
his
future
ministry
in
his
own
mind
he
felt
assured
about
that
part
but
in
order
to
excuse
his
delay
in
being
frank
with
his
wife
he
told
himself
that
he
was
not
as
yet
definitely
committed
to
lady
sunderbund
project
and
in
accordance
with
that
idea
he
set
up
housekeeping
in
london
upon
a
scale
that
implied
a
very
complete
cessation
of
income
as
yet
he
told
lady
ella
we
do
not
know
where
we
stand
for
a
time
we
must
not
so
much
house
ourselves
as
camp
we
must
take
some
quite
small
and
modest
house
in
some
less
expensive
district
if
possible
i
would
like
to
take
it
for
a
year
until
we
know
better
how
things
are
with
he
reviewed
a
choice
of
london
districts
lady
ella
said
her
bitterest
thing
does
it
matter
where
we
hide
our
heads
that
wrung
him
to
we
are
not
hiding
our
she
repented
at
once
i
am
sorry
ted
she
said
it
slipped
from
he
called
it
camping
but
the
house
they
had
found
in
pembury
road
notting
hill
was
more
darkened
and
less
airy
than
any
camp
neither
he
nor
his
wife
had
ever
had
any
experience
of
or
housekeeping
before
and
they
spent
three
of
the
most
desolating
days
of
their
lives
in
looking
for
this
cheap
and
modest
shelter
for
their
household
possessions
hitherto
life
had
moved
them
from
one
established
and
comfortable
home
to
another
their
worst
affliction
had
been
the
modern
decorations
of
the
palace
at
princhester
and
it
was
altogether
a
revelation
to
them
to
visit
house
after
house
with
dingy
paint
and
peeling
wallpaper
kitchens
for
the
most
part
underground
and
either
without
bathrooms
or
with
bathrooms
that
were
manifestly
grudging
afterthoughts
such
as
harbour
the
respectable
middle
classes
of
london
the
house
agents
perceived
intimations
of
helplessness
in
their
manner
adopted
a
rushing
method
with
them
strange
to
people
who
had
hitherto
lived
in
a
glowing
halo
of
episcopal
dignity
take
it
or
leave
it
was
the
note
of
those
gentlemen
there
are
always
people
ready
for
the
line
that
property
in
land
and
houses
takes
in
england
the
realized
is
always
to
hold
up
and
look
scornful
the
position
of
the
class
in
a
crowded
country
like
england
is
it
is
under
no
obligation
to
be
of
use
and
people
are
obliged
to
get
down
to
the
land
somewhere
they
can
not
conduct
business
and
rear
families
in
the
air
england
necessity
is
the
opportunity
scrope
began
to
generalize
about
this
and
develop
a
new
and
sincerer
streak
of
socialism
in
his
ideas
the
church
has
been
very
remiss
he
said
as
he
and
lady
ella
stared
at
the
basement
breakfast
room
of
their
dismal
possibility
it
should
have
insisted
far
more
than
it
has
done
upon
the
landlord
responsibility
no
one
should
tolerate
the
offer
of
such
a
house
as
this
at
such
a
rent
to
decent
people
it
is
at
the
house
agent
he
asked
in
a
cold
intelligent
voice
the
name
of
the
offending
landlord
it
all
the
property
of
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
that
side
of
the
railway
said
the
agent
picking
his
teeth
with
a
pin
lazy
lot
dreadfully
hard
to
get
to
do
anything
own
some
of
the
worst
properties
in
lady
ella
saw
things
differently
again
if
you
had
stayed
in
the
church
she
said
afterwards
you
might
have
helped
to
alter
such
things
as
at
the
time
he
had
no
answer
but
he
said
presently
as
they
went
back
in
the
tube
to
their
modest
bloomsbury
hotel
if
i
had
stayed
in
the
church
i
should
never
have
realized
things
like
but
it
does
no
justice
to
lady
ella
to
record
these
two
unavoidable
expressions
of
regret
without
telling
also
of
the
rallying
courage
with
which
she
presently
took
over
the
task
of
resettling
herself
and
her
stricken
family
her
husband
change
of
opinion
had
fallen
upon
her
out
of
a
clear
sky
without
any
premonition
in
one
tremendous
day
in
one
day
there
had
come
clamouring
upon
her
with
an
effect
of
revelation
after
revelation
the
ideas
of
drugs
of
heresy
and
blasphemy
of
an
alien
feminine
influence
of
the
entire
moral
and
material
breakdown
of
the
man
who
had
been
the
centre
of
her
life
never
was
the
whole
world
of
a
woman
so
swiftly
and
comprehensively
smashed
all
the
previous
troubles
of
her
life
seemed
infinitesimal
in
comparison
with
any
single
item
in
this
dismaying
debacle
she
tried
to
consolidate
it
in
the
idea
that
he
was
ill
she
assured
herself
that
he
would
return
from
hunstanton
restored
to
health
and
orthodoxy
with
all
his
threatenings
of
a
resignation
recalled
the
man
she
had
loved
and
trusted
to
succeed
in
the
world
and
to
do
right
always
according
to
her
ideas
it
was
only
with
extreme
reluctance
that
she
faced
the
fact
that
with
the
fumes
of
the
drug
dispelled
and
all
signs
of
nervous
exhaustion
gone
he
still
pressed
quietly
but
resolutely
toward
a
severance
from
the
church
she
tried
to
argue
with
him
and
she
found
she
could
not
argue
the
church
was
a
crystal
sphere
in
which
her
life
was
wholly
contained
her
mind
could
not
go
outside
it
even
to
consider
a
dissentient
proposition
while
he
was
at
hunstanton
every
day
she
had
prayed
for
an
hour
some
days
she
had
prayed
for
several
hours
in
the
cathedral
kneeling
upon
a
harsh
hassock
that
hurt
her
knees
even
in
her
prayers
she
could
not
argue
nor
vary
she
prayed
over
and
over
again
many
hundreds
of
times
bring
him
back
dear
lord
bring
him
back
in
the
past
he
had
always
been
a
very
kind
and
friendly
mate
to
her
but
sometimes
he
had
been
irritable
about
small
things
especially
during
his
seasons
of
insomnia
now
he
came
back
changed
a
much
graver
man
rather
older
in
his
manner
carefully
attentive
to
her
kinder
and
more
watchful
at
times
astonishingly
apologetic
but
rigidly
set
upon
his
purpose
of
leaving
the
church
i
know
you
do
not
think
with
me
in
this
he
said
i
have
to
pray
you
to
be
patient
with
me
i
have
struggled
with
my
conscience
for
a
time
it
means
hardship
i
know
poverty
but
if
you
will
trust
me
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
pull
through
there
are
ways
of
doing
my
work
perhaps
we
shall
not
have
to
undergo
this
cramping
in
this
house
for
very
long
it
is
not
the
poverty
i
fear
said
lady
ella
and
she
did
face
the
worldly
situation
if
a
little
sadly
at
any
rate
with
the
courage
of
practical
energy
it
was
she
who
stood
in
one
ungainly
house
after
another
and
schemed
how
to
make
discomforts
tolerable
while
scrope
raged
unhelpfully
at
landlordism
and
the
responsibility
of
the
church
for
economic
disorder
it
was
she
who
at
last
took
decisions
into
her
hands
when
he
was
too
jaded
to
do
anything
but
generalize
weakly
and
settled
upon
the
house
in
pembury
road
which
became
their
london
home
she
got
him
to
visit
hunstanton
again
for
half
a
week
while
she
and
miriam
who
was
the
practical
genius
of
the
family
moved
in
and
made
the
new
home
presentable
at
the
best
it
was
barely
presentable
there
were
many
plain
hardships
the
girls
had
to
share
one
of
the
chief
bedrooms
in
common
instead
of
their
jolly
little
individual
dens
at
princhester
one
little
room
was
all
that
could
be
squeezed
out
as
a
study
for
father
it
was
not
really
a
separate
room
it
was
merely
cut
off
by
closed
folding
doors
from
the
folding
doors
that
slowly
transmitted
the
dinner
flavours
to
a
sensitive
worker
and
its
window
looked
out
upon
a
blackened
and
uneventful
yard
and
the
skylights
of
a
populous
conversational
and
millinery
establishment
that
had
been
built
over
the
corresponding
garden
of
the
house
in
restharrow
street
lady
ella
had
this
room
lined
with
open
shelves
and
clementina
in
the
absence
of
eleanor
at
newuham
arranged
the
pick
of
her
father
books
it
is
to
be
noted
as
a
fact
of
psychological
interest
that
this
cramped
little
room
distressed
lady
ella
more
than
any
other
of
the
discomforts
of
their
new
quarters
the
bishop
filled
a
whole
side
of
it
parsimony
ruled
her
mind
but
she
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
get
him
at
least
a
seemly
he
came
back
from
hunstanton
full
of
ideas
for
work
in
london
he
was
he
thought
going
to
write
something
about
his
views
he
was
very
grateful
and
much
surprised
at
what
she
had
done
to
that
forbidding
house
and
full
of
hints
and
intimations
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
they
moved
to
something
roomier
she
was
disposed
to
seek
some
sort
of
salaried
employment
for
clementina
and
miriam
at
least
but
he
would
not
hear
of
that
they
must
go
on
and
get
educated
he
said
if
i
have
to
give
up
smoking
to
do
it
perhaps
i
may
manage
even
without
eleanor
it
seemed
had
a
good
prospect
of
a
scholarship
at
the
london
school
of
economics
that
would
practically
keep
her
there
would
be
no
cambridge
for
clementina
but
london
university
might
still
be
possible
with
a
little
pinching
and
the
move
to
london
had
really
improved
the
prospects
of
a
good
musical
training
for
miriam
phoebe
and
daphne
lady
ella
believed
might
get
in
on
special
terms
at
the
notting
hill
high
school
scrope
found
it
difficult
to
guess
at
what
was
going
on
in
the
heads
of
his
younger
daughters
none
displayed
such
sympathy
as
eleanor
had
confessed
he
had
a
feeling
that
his
wife
had
schooled
them
to
say
nothing
about
the
change
in
their
fortunes
to
him
but
they
quarrelled
a
good
deal
he
could
hear
about
the
use
of
the
one
bathroom
there
was
never
enough
hot
water
after
the
second
bath
and
miriam
did
not
seem
to
enjoy
playing
the
new
upright
piano
in
the
as
much
as
she
had
done
the
princhester
grand
it
replaced
though
she
was
always
willing
to
play
that
thing
he
liked
he
knew
now
that
it
was
the
adagio
of
of
whenever
he
asked
for
it
london
servants
lady
ella
found
were
now
much
more
difficult
to
get
than
they
had
been
in
the
holy
innocents
days
in
john
wood
and
more
difficult
to
manage
when
they
were
got
the
households
of
the
more
prosperous
clergy
are
much
sought
after
by
domestics
of
a
serious
and
excellent
type
an
unfrocked
clergyman
household
is
by
no
means
so
attractive
the
first
comers
were
young
women
of
unfortunate
dispositions
the
first
cook
was
reluctant
and
insolent
she
went
before
her
month
was
up
the
second
careless
she
made
burnt
potatoes
and
cindered
chops
underboiled
and
overboiled
eggs
a
dropped
look
about
everything
harsh
coffee
and
bitter
tea
seemed
to
be
a
natural
aspect
of
the
state
of
being
no
longer
a
bishop
he
would
often
after
a
struggle
with
his
nerves
in
the
bedroom
come
humming
cheerfully
to
breakfast
to
find
that
phoebe
who
was
a
delicate
eater
had
pushed
her
plate
away
scarcely
touched
while
lady
ella
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
in
a
state
of
dangerous
calm
framing
comments
for
delivering
downstairs
that
would
be
sure
to
sting
and
yet
leave
no
opening
for
repartee
and
trying
at
the
same
time
to
believe
that
a
third
cook
if
the
chances
were
risked
again
would
certainly
be
all
the
was
papered
with
a
morose
wallpaper
that
the
landlord
in
view
of
the
fact
that
scrope
in
his
optimism
would
only
take
the
house
on
a
yearly
agreement
had
refused
to
replace
it
was
a
design
of
very
dark
green
leaves
and
grey
gothic
arches
and
the
apartment
was
lit
by
a
chandelier
which
spilt
a
pool
of
light
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
splashed
useless
weak
patches
elsewhere
lady
ella
had
to
interfere
to
prevent
the
monopolization
of
this
centre
by
phoebe
and
daphne
for
their
home
work
this
light
trouble
was
difficult
to
arrange
the
plain
truth
was
that
there
was
not
enough
illumination
to
go
round
in
the
princhester
there
had
been
a
number
of
obliging
little
electric
pushes
the
size
of
the
now
that
the
study
was
cut
off
from
it
forbade
hospitality
as
it
was
with
only
the
family
at
home
the
housemaid
made
it
a
grievance
that
she
could
scarcely
squeeze
by
on
the
sideboard
side
to
wait
the
house
vibrated
to
the
trains
in
the
adjacent
underground
railway
there
was
a
lady
next
door
but
one
who
was
very
pluckily
training
a
contralto
voice
that
most
people
would
have
gladly
thrown
away
at
the
end
of
restharrow
street
was
a
garage
and
a
yard
where
chauffeurs
were
accustomed
to
tune
up
their
engines
all
these
facts
were
persistently
audible
to
any
one
sitting
down
in
the
little
back
study
to
think
out
this
project
of
writing
something
about
a
change
in
the
government
of
the
whole
world
petty
inconveniences
no
doubt
all
these
inconveniences
were
but
they
distressed
a
rather
oversensitive
mind
which
was
also
acutely
aware
that
even
upon
this
scale
living
would
cost
certainly
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
if
not
more
in
excess
of
the
little
private
income
available
these
domestic
details
irrelevant
as
they
may
seem
in
a
spiritual
history
need
to
be
given
because
they
added
an
intimate
keenness
to
scrope
readiness
for
this
private
chapel
enterprise
that
he
was
discussing
with
lady
sunderbund
along
that
line
and
along
that
line
alone
he
saw
the
way
of
escape
from
the
great
sea
of
london
dinginess
that
threatened
to
submerge
his
family
and
it
was
also
he
felt
the
line
of
his
duty
it
was
his
at
least
that
was
how
he
felt
at
first
and
then
matters
began
to
grow
complicated
again
things
had
gone
far
between
himself
and
lady
sunderbund
since
that
letter
he
had
read
upon
the
beach
at
old
hunstanton
the
blinds
of
the
house
with
the
very
very
blue
door
in
princhester
had
been
drawn
from
the
day
when
the
first
vanload
of
the
renegade
bishop
private
possessions
had
departed
from
the
palace
the
lady
had
returned
to
the
brightly
decorated
flat
overlooking
hyde
park
he
had
seen
her
repeatedly
since
then
and
always
with
a
fairly
clear
understanding
that
she
was
to
provide
the
chapel
and
pulpit
in
which
he
was
to
proclaim
to
london
the
gospel
of
the
simplicity
and
universality
of
god
he
was
to
be
the
prophet
of
a
reconsidered
faith
calling
the
whole
world
from
creeds
and
sects
from
egotisms
and
vain
loyalties
from
prejudices
of
race
and
custom
to
the
worship
and
service
of
the
divine
king
of
all
mankind
that
in
fact
had
been
the
ruling
resolve
in
his
mind
the
resolve
determining
his
relations
not
only
with
lady
sunderbund
but
with
lady
ella
and
his
family
his
friends
enemies
and
associates
he
had
set
out
upon
this
course
unchecked
by
any
doubt
and
overriding
the
manifest
disapproval
of
his
wife
and
his
younger
daughters
lady
sunderbund
enthusiasm
had
been
enormous
and
sustaining
almost
imperceptibly
that
resolve
had
weakened
imperceptibly
at
first
then
the
decline
had
been
perceived
as
one
sometimes
perceives
a
thing
in
the
background
out
of
the
corner
of
one
eye
in
all
his
early
anticipations
of
the
chapel
enterprise
he
had
imagined
himself
in
the
likeness
of
a
small
but
eloquent
figure
standing
in
a
large
exposed
place
and
calling
this
lost
misled
world
back
to
god
lady
sunderbund
he
assumed
was
to
provide
the
large
exposed
place
which
was
dimly
paved
with
pews
and
guarantee
that
little
matter
which
was
to
relieve
him
of
sordid
anxieties
for
his
family
the
stipend
he
had
agreed
in
an
inattentive
way
that
this
was
to
be
eight
hundred
a
year
with
a
certain
proportion
of
the
subscriptions
at
first
i
shall
be
the
chief
subscriber
she
said
before
the
rush
he
had
been
so
content
to
take
all
this
for
granted
and
think
no
more
about
it
more
particularly
to
think
no
more
about
it
that
for
a
time
he
entirely
disregarded
the
intense
decorative
activities
into
which
lady
sunderbund
incontinently
plunged
had
he
been
inclined
to
remark
them
he
certainly
might
have
done
so
even
though
a
considerable
proportion
was
being
thoughtfully
veiled
for
a
time
from
his
eyes
for
example
there
was
the
young
architect
with
the
wonderful
tie
whom
he
met
once
or
twice
at
lunch
in
the
hyde
park
flat
this
young
man
pulled
the
conversation
again
and
again
lady
sunderbund
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
direction
of
the
ideal
it
was
his
ambition
he
said
someday
to
build
an
ideal
church
divorced
from
scrope
had
been
drawn
at
last
into
a
dissertation
he
said
that
hitherto
all
temples
and
places
of
worship
had
been
conditioned
by
orientation
due
to
the
seasonal
aspects
of
religion
they
pointed
to
the
west
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
egyptian
temples
to
some
particular
star
and
by
sacramentalism
which
centred
everything
on
a
highly
lit
sacrificial
altar
it
was
almost
impossible
to
think
of
a
church
built
upon
other
lines
than
that
the
architect
would
be
so
free
that
absolutely
free
interrupted
the
young
architect
he
might
for
example
build
a
temple
like
a
or
like
some
wondyful
casket
said
lady
sunderbund
and
also
there
was
a
musician
with
fuzzy
hair
and
an
impulsive
way
of
taking
the
salted
almonds
who
wanted
to
know
about
religious
music
scrope
hazarded
the
idea
that
a
chanting
people
was
a
religious
people
he
said
moreover
that
there
was
a
fine
religiosity
about
moussorgski
but
that
the
most
beautiful
single
piece
of
music
in
the
world
was
beethoven
sonata
opus
he
was
thinking
he
said
more
particularly
of
the
adagio
at
the
end
molto
semplice
e
cantabile
it
had
a
real
quality
of
divinity
the
musician
betrayed
impatience
at
the
name
of
beethoven
and
thought
with
his
mouth
appreciatively
full
of
salted
almonds
that
nowadays
we
had
got
a
little
beyond
that
anyhow
we
shall
be
superhuman
before
we
get
beyond
either
purcell
or
beethoven
said
scrope
nor
did
he
attach
sufficient
importance
to
lady
sunderbund
disposition
to
invite
positivists
members
of
the
brotherhood
church
leaders
among
the
christian
scientists
old
followers
of
the
rev
charles
voysey
swedenborgians
moslem
converts
indian
theosophists
psychic
phenomena
and
so
forth
to
meet
him
nevertheless
it
began
to
drift
into
his
mind
that
he
was
by
no
means
so
completely
in
control
of
the
new
departure
as
he
had
supposed
at
first
both
he
and
lady
sunderbund
professed
universalism
but
while
his
was
the
universalism
of
one
who
would
simplify
to
the
bare
fundamentals
of
a
common
faith
hers
was
the
universalism
of
the
collector
religion
to
him
was
something
that
illuminated
the
soul
to
her
it
was
something
that
illuminated
for
a
considerable
time
they
followed
their
divergent
inclinations
without
any
realization
of
their
divergence
none
the
less
a
vague
doubt
and
dissatisfaction
with
the
prospect
before
him
arose
to
cloud
his
confidence
at
first
there
was
little
or
no
doubt
of
his
own
faith
he
was
still
altogether
convinced
that
he
had
to
confess
and
proclaim
god
in
his
life
he
was
as
sure
that
god
was
the
necessary
king
and
saviour
of
mankind
and
of
a
man
life
as
he
was
of
the
truth
of
the
binomial
theorem
but
what
began
first
to
fade
was
the
idea
that
he
had
been
specially
called
to
proclaim
the
true
god
to
all
the
world
he
would
have
the
most
amiable
conference
with
lady
sunderbund
and
then
as
he
walked
back
to
notting
hill
he
would
suddenly
find
stuck
into
his
mind
like
a
challenge
heaven
knows
how
another
prophet
even
if
he
succeeded
in
this
mission
enterprise
he
found
himself
asking
what
would
he
be
but
just
a
little
mahomet
he
would
have
founded
another
sect
and
we
have
to
make
an
end
to
all
sects
how
is
there
to
be
an
end
to
sects
if
there
are
still
to
be
chapels
richly
decorated
chapels
and
congregations
and
salaried
specialists
in
god
that
was
a
very
disconcerting
idea
it
was
particularly
active
at
night
he
did
his
best
to
consider
it
with
a
cool
detachment
regardless
of
the
facts
that
his
private
income
was
just
under
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
that
his
experiments
in
cultured
journalism
made
it
extremely
improbable
that
the
most
sedulous
literary
work
would
do
more
than
double
this
scanty
sum
yet
for
all
that
these
nasty
ugly
sordid
facts
were
entirely
disregarded
they
did
somehow
persist
in
coming
in
and
squatting
down
shapeless
in
a
black
corner
of
his
mind
from
which
their
eyes
shone
out
so
to
speak
whenever
his
doubt
whether
he
ought
to
set
up
as
a
prophet
at
all
was
under
consideration
then
very
suddenly
on
this
october
afternoon
the
situation
had
come
to
a
crisis
he
had
gone
to
lady
sunderbund
flat
to
see
the
plans
and
drawings
for
the
new
church
in
which
he
was
to
give
his
message
to
the
world
they
had
brought
home
to
him
the
complete
realization
of
lady
impossibility
he
had
attempted
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
an
explanation
of
just
how
much
they
differed
and
he
had
precipitated
a
storm
of
extravagantly
perplexing
emotions
she
kept
him
waiting
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
before
she
brought
the
plans
to
him
he
waited
in
the
little
room
with
the
wyndham
lewis
picture
that
opened
upon
the
balcony
painted
with
crazy
squares
of
livid
pink
on
a
golden
table
by
the
window
a
number
of
recently
bought
books
were
lying
and
he
went
and
stood
over
these
taking
them
up
one
after
another
the
first
was
the
countess
of
huntingdon
and
her
circle
that
bearder
of
lightminded
archbishops
that
formidable
harbourer
of
wesleyan
chaplains
for
some
minutes
he
studied
the
grim
portrait
of
this
inspired
lady
standing
with
one
foot
ostentatiously
on
her
coronet
and
then
turned
to
the
next
volume
this
was
a
life
of
saint
teresa
that
energetic
organizer
of
spanish
nunneries
the
third
dealt
with
madame
guyon
it
was
difficult
not
to
feel
that
lady
sunderbund
was
reading
for
a
part
she
entered
she
was
wearing
a
long
simple
dress
of
spangled
white
with
a
very
high
waist
she
had
a
bracelet
of
green
jade
a
waistband
of
green
silk
and
her
hair
was
held
by
a
wreath
of
artificial
laurel
very
stiff
and
green
her
arms
were
full
of
big
rolls
of
cartridge
paper
and
tracing
paper
i
so
pleased
she
said
it
at
last
and
i
can
show
she
banged
the
whole
armful
down
upon
a
vivid
little
table
of
inlaid
black
and
white
wood
he
rescued
one
or
two
rolls
and
a
sheet
of
tracing
paper
from
the
floor
it
the
temple
she
panted
in
a
significant
whisper
it
the
temple
of
the
one
god
she
scrabbled
among
the
papers
and
held
up
the
elevation
of
a
strange
square
building
to
his
startled
eyes
it
just
she
demanded
he
took
the
drawing
from
her
it
represented
a
building
manifestly
an
enormous
building
consisting
largely
of
two
great
deeply
fluted
towers
flanking
a
vast
archway
approached
by
a
long
flight
of
steps
between
the
towers
appeared
a
dome
it
was
as
if
the
mosque
of
saint
sophia
had
produced
this
offspring
in
a
mesalliance
with
the
cathedral
of
wells
its
enormity
was
made
manifest
by
the
minuteness
of
the
large
automobiles
that
were
driving
away
in
the
foreground
after
setting
here
is
the
plan
she
said
thrusting
another
sheet
upon
him
before
he
could
fully
take
in
the
quality
of
the
design
the
hall
is
to
be
no
aisle
no
altar
and
in
lettas
of
sapphiah
is
she
added
with
a
note
of
solemnity
it
will
hold
thousand
people
sitting
but
said
scrope
a
sort
of
she
said
it
young
venable
his
but
is
this
to
go
on
that
little
site
in
aldwych
he
says
the
is
the
she
explained
he
wants
to
put
it
out
at
golda
but
if
it
is
to
be
this
little
simple
chapel
we
proposed
then
our
idea
to
be
central
but
if
the
is
she
said
conclusively
and
is
this
it
rather
a
costly
undertaking
rather
more
costly
that
does
matta
i
making
heaps
and
heaps
of
money
half
my
is
in
shipping
and
a
lot
of
the
in
munitions
i
than
eva
is
the
a
sort
of
she
pressed
he
put
the
elevation
down
he
took
the
plan
from
her
hands
and
seemed
to
study
it
but
he
was
really
staring
blankly
at
the
whole
situation
lady
sunderbund
he
said
at
last
with
an
effort
i
am
afraid
all
this
wo
wo
do
no
it
is
in
the
spirit
of
my
intention
it
is
in
a
great
building
of
this
sort
so
so
ornate
and
imposing
that
the
simple
gospel
of
god
universal
kingdom
can
be
but
ought
so
gate
a
message
to
have
as
a
pulpit
and
then
as
if
she
would
seize
him
before
he
could
go
on
to
further
repudiations
she
sought
hastily
among
the
drawings
again
but
look
she
said
it
has
it
not
only
a
place
it
a
headquarters
for
with
the
rapid
movements
of
an
excited
child
she
began
to
thrust
the
remarkable
features
and
merits
of
the
great
project
upon
him
the
preaching
dome
was
only
the
heart
of
it
there
were
to
be
a
library
consultation
rooms
classrooms
a
publication
department
a
big
underground
printing
establishment
nowadays
she
said
gate
movement
must
there
was
to
be
music
she
said
a
gate
invisible
hidden
amidst
the
architectural
details
and
pouring
out
its
sounds
into
the
dome
and
then
she
glanced
in
passing
at
possible
round
the
preaching
dome
this
preaching
dome
was
not
a
mere
drum
for
spiritual
reverberations
around
it
ran
great
open
corridors
and
in
these
corridors
there
were
to
be
but
what
for
he
asked
stemming
the
torrent
what
need
is
there
for
chapels
there
are
to
be
no
altars
no
masses
no
sacraments
no
she
said
but
they
are
to
be
chapels
for
special
a
chapel
for
science
a
chapel
for
healing
a
chapel
for
places
for
peoples
to
sit
and
think
about
those
things
with
paintings
and
i
see
your
intention
he
admitted
i
see
your
the
is
to
be
a
gate
blue
chapel
for
sta
and
atoms
and
the
of
her
voice
grew
solemn
all
still
and
deep
and
high
like
a
in
a
place
you
will
go
down
steps
to
it
a
with
mathematical
symbols
and
balances
and
scientific
and
the
next
to
it
the
next
is
to
be
a
little
chapel
for
and
flowas
yes
he
said
it
is
all
very
fine
and
expressive
it
is
i
see
a
symbolical
building
a
great
artistic
possibility
but
is
it
the
place
for
me
what
i
have
to
say
is
something
very
simple
that
god
is
the
king
of
the
whole
world
king
of
the
newspaper
and
the
omnibus
and
the
vulgar
everyday
things
and
that
they
have
to
worship
him
and
serve
him
as
their
leader
in
every
moment
of
their
lives
this
that
this
is
the
old
religions
over
again
this
is
taking
god
apart
this
is
putting
him
into
a
fresh
casket
instead
of
the
old
one
and
i
do
like
do
like
it
she
cried
and
stood
apart
from
him
with
her
chin
in
the
air
a
tall
astonishment
and
dismay
i
ca
do
the
work
i
want
to
do
with
but
is
it
you
idea
no
it
is
not
in
the
least
my
idea
i
want
to
tell
the
whole
world
of
the
one
god
that
can
alone
unite
it
and
save
it
and
you
make
this
extravagant
he
felt
as
if
he
had
struck
her
directly
he
uttered
that
last
word
toy
she
echoed
taking
it
in
you
call
it
a
toy
a
note
in
her
voice
reminded
him
that
there
were
two
people
who
might
feel
strongly
in
this
affair
my
dear
lady
sunderbund
he
said
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
i
must
needs
follow
the
light
of
my
own
mind
i
have
had
a
vision
of
god
i
have
seen
him
as
a
great
leader
towering
over
the
little
lives
of
men
demanding
the
little
lives
of
men
prepared
to
take
them
and
guide
them
to
the
salvation
of
mankind
and
the
conquest
of
pain
and
death
i
have
seen
him
as
the
god
of
the
human
affair
a
god
of
politics
a
god
of
such
muddy
and
bloody
wars
as
this
war
a
god
of
economics
a
god
of
railway
junctions
and
clinics
and
factories
and
evening
schools
a
god
in
fact
of
men
this
god
this
god
here
that
you
want
to
worship
is
a
god
of
artists
and
poets
of
elegant
poets
a
god
of
a
god
of
choice
allusions
oh
it
has
its
grandeur
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
what
you
are
doing
may
not
be
altogether
fine
and
right
for
you
to
do
but
it
is
not
what
i
have
to
do
i
can
not
indeed
i
can
not
go
on
with
this
project
upon
these
he
paused
flushed
and
breathless
lady
sunderbund
had
heard
him
to
the
end
her
bright
face
was
brightly
flushed
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
it
was
like
her
that
they
should
seem
tears
of
the
largest
most
expensive
sort
tears
of
the
first
water
but
she
cried
and
her
red
delicate
mouth
went
awry
with
dismay
and
disappointment
and
her
expression
was
the
half
incredulous
expression
of
a
child
suddenly
and
cruelly
disappointed
you
wo
go
on
with
all
this
no
he
said
my
dear
lady
sunderbund
oh
do
lady
sunderbund
me
she
cried
with
a
novel
rudeness
you
see
i
done
it
all
for
you
he
winced
and
felt
boorish
he
had
never
liked
and
disapproved
of
lady
sunderbund
so
much
as
he
did
at
that
moment
and
he
had
no
words
for
her
how
can
i
stop
it
all
at
once
like
this
and
still
he
had
no
answer
she
pursued
her
advantage
what
am
i
to
do
she
cried
she
turned
upon
him
passionately
look
what
you
done
she
marked
her
points
with
finger
upheld
and
gave
odd
suggestions
in
her
face
of
an
angry
coster
girl
eva
since
i
met
you
i
you
been
to
follow
you
anywhe
to
do
anything
eva
since
that
night
when
you
sat
so
calm
and
dignified
and
they
baited
you
and
you
when
they
we
all
vain
and
cleva
and
you
you
thought
only
of
god
and
and
did
mind
fo
up
to
then
i
been
living
oh
the
emptiest
life
the
tears
ran
i
shall
live
it
again
she
dashed
her
grief
away
with
a
hand
beringed
with
stones
as
big
as
beetles
i
said
to
myself
this
man
knows
something
i
do
know
he
got
the
seeds
of
life
i
made
up
my
mind
then
and
the
i
follow
you
and
back
you
and
do
all
i
could
fo
you
i
lived
fo
you
since
lived
fo
you
and
now
when
all
my
little
plans
are
you
oh
she
made
a
quaint
little
gesture
with
pink
fists
upraised
and
then
stood
with
her
hand
held
up
staring
at
the
plans
and
drawings
that
were
littered
over
the
inlaid
table
i
planned
and
planned
i
said
i
will
build
him
a
temple
i
will
be
his
temple
just
a
she
could
not
go
on
but
it
is
just
these
temples
that
have
confused
mankind
he
said
not
my
temple
she
said
presently
now
openly
weeping
over
the
gay
rejected
drawings
you
could
have
explained
oh
she
said
petulantly
and
thrust
them
away
from
her
so
that
they
went
sliding
one
after
the
other
on
to
the
floor
for
some
moments
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
the
slowly
accelerated
slide
and
flop
of
one
sheet
of
cartridge
paper
after
another
we
could
have
been
so
happy
she
wailed
oua
and
then
this
disconcerting
lady
did
a
still
more
disconcerting
thing
she
staggered
a
step
towards
scrape
seized
the
lapels
of
his
coat
bowed
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
put
her
black
hair
against
his
cheek
and
began
sobbing
and
weeping
my
dear
lady
he
expostulated
trying
weakly
to
disengage
her
let
me
she
insisted
gripping
more
resolutely
and
following
his
backward
pace
you
must
let
me
you
must
let
me
his
resistance
ceased
one
hand
supported
her
the
other
patted
her
shining
hair
my
dear
child
he
said
my
dear
child
i
had
no
idea
that
you
would
take
it
like
this
that
was
but
the
opening
of
an
enormous
interview
presently
he
had
contrived
in
a
helpful
and
sympathetic
manner
to
seat
the
unhappy
lady
on
a
sofa
and
when
after
some
cramped
discourse
she
stood
up
before
him
wiping
her
eyes
with
a
wet
wonder
of
lace
to
deliver
herself
the
better
a
newborn
appreciation
of
the
tactics
of
the
situation
made
him
walk
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
under
colour
of
picking
up
a
drawing
in
the
retrospect
he
tried
to
disentangle
the
threads
of
a
discussion
that
went
to
and
fro
and
contradicted
itself
and
began
again
far
back
among
things
that
had
seemed
forgotten
and
disposed
of
lady
sunderbund
mind
was
extravagantly
untrained
a
mental
thicket
at
times
she
reproached
him
as
if
he
were
a
heartless
god
at
times
she
talked
as
if
he
were
a
recalcitrant
servant
her
mingling
of
utter
devotion
and
the
completest
disregard
for
his
thoughts
and
wishes
dazzled
and
distressed
his
mind
it
was
clear
that
for
half
a
year
her
clear
bold
absurd
will
had
been
crystallized
upon
the
idea
of
giving
him
exactly
what
she
wanted
him
to
want
the
crystal
sphere
of
those
ambitions
lay
now
shattered
between
them
she
was
trying
to
reconstruct
it
before
his
eyes
she
was
she
declared
prepared
to
alter
her
plans
in
any
way
that
would
meet
his
wishes
she
had
not
understood
if
it
is
a
toy
she
cried
show
me
how
to
make
it
not
a
toy
make
it
he
said
it
was
the
bare
idea
of
a
temple
that
made
it
impossible
and
there
was
this
drawing
here
what
did
it
mean
he
held
it
out
to
her
it
represented
a
figure
distressingly
like
himself
robed
as
a
priest
in
vestments
she
snatched
the
offending
drawing
from
him
and
tore
it
to
shreds
if
you
do
want
a
temple
have
a
you
wanted
a
just
any
old
he
said
not
that
special
one
a
place
without
choirs
and
if
you
wo
have
music
she
responded
do
have
music
if
god
does
want
music
it
can
go
i
ca
think
god
does
not
of
music
but
that
is
for
you
to
settle
if
you
do
like
the
being
we
make
it
all
plain
some
dome
all
and
black
if
it
is
to
be
beautiful
it
can
be
ugly
yes
ugly
it
can
be
as
ugly
she
sobbed
as
the
city
temple
we
will
get
some
otha
some
city
some
man
who
has
built
banks
or
stations
that
if
you
think
it
pleases
god
young
venable
only
why
should
you
not
let
me
make
a
place
fo
message
why
should
it
be
me
you
must
have
a
place
you
got
as
a
man
not
as
a
then
as
a
man
you
must
still
wea
just
ordinary
clothes
a
clothes
in
the
fashion
she
said
you
would
have
to
go
to
you
taila
for
a
new
coat
with
put
on
or
two
buttons
instead
of
one
need
be
is
how
can
you
help
it
some
people
wea
old
fashions
that
all
a
cassock
an
old
fashion
there
nothing
so
plain
as
a
except
that
it
a
clerical
fashion
i
want
to
be
just
as
i
am
if
you
think
that
that
owoble
suit
is
clothes
she
said
and
stared
at
him
and
gave
way
to
tears
of
real
tenderness
a
cassock
she
cried
with
passion
just
a
plain
cassock
fo
deecency
oh
if
you
wo
not
even
that
as
he
walked
now
after
his
unsuccessful
quest
of
towards
the
serpentine
he
acted
that
stormy
interview
with
lady
sunderbund
over
again
at
the
end
as
a
condition
indeed
of
his
departure
he
had
left
things
open
he
had
assented
to
certain
promises
he
was
to
make
her
understand
better
what
it
was
he
needed
he
was
not
to
let
anything
that
had
happened
affect
that
she
was
to
abandon
all
her
plans
she
was
to
begin
again
at
the
but
he
knew
that
indeed
there
should
be
no
more
beginning
again
with
her
he
knew
that
quite
beyond
these
questions
of
the
organization
of
a
purified
religion
it
was
time
their
association
ended
she
had
wept
upon
him
she
had
clasped
both
his
hands
at
parting
and
prayed
to
be
forgiven
she
was
drawing
him
closer
to
her
by
their
very
dissension
she
had
infected
him
with
the
softness
of
remorse
from
being
a
bright
and
spirited
person
she
had
converted
herself
into
a
warm
and
touching
person
her
fine
bright
black
hair
against
his
cheek
and
the
clasp
of
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
was
now
inextricably
in
the
business
the
perplexing
the
astonishing
thing
in
his
situation
was
that
there
was
still
a
reluctance
to
make
a
conclusive
breach
he
was
not
the
first
of
men
who
have
tried
to
find
in
vain
how
and
when
a
relationship
becomes
an
entanglement
he
ought
to
break
off
now
and
the
riddle
was
just
why
he
should
feel
this
compunction
in
breaking
off
now
he
had
disappointed
her
and
he
ought
not
to
have
disappointed
her
that
was
the
essential
feeling
he
had
never
realized
before
as
he
realized
now
this
peculiar
quality
of
his
own
mind
and
the
gulf
into
which
it
was
leading
him
it
came
as
an
illuminating
discovery
he
was
a
social
animal
he
had
an
instinctive
disposition
to
act
according
to
the
expectations
of
the
people
about
him
whether
they
were
reasonable
or
congenial
expectations
or
whether
they
were
not
that
he
saw
for
the
first
time
had
been
the
ruling
motive
of
his
life
it
was
the
clue
to
him
man
is
not
a
reasonable
creature
he
is
a
socially
responsive
creature
trying
to
be
reasonable
in
spite
of
that
fact
from
the
days
in
the
rectory
nursery
when
scrope
had
tried
to
be
a
good
boy
on
the
whole
and
just
a
little
naughty
sometimes
until
they
stopped
smiling
through
all
his
life
of
school
university
curacy
vicarage
and
episcopacy
up
to
this
present
moment
he
perceived
now
that
he
had
acted
upon
no
authentic
and
independent
impulse
his
impulse
had
always
been
to
fall
in
with
people
and
satisfy
them
and
all
the
painful
conflicts
of
those
last
few
years
had
been
due
to
a
growing
realization
of
jarring
criticisms
of
antagonized
forces
that
required
from
him
incompatible
things
from
which
he
had
now
taken
refuge
or
at
any
rate
sought
refuge
in
god
it
was
paradoxical
but
manifestly
in
god
he
not
only
sank
his
individuality
but
discovered
it
it
was
wonderful
how
much
he
had
thought
and
still
thought
of
the
feelings
and
desires
of
lady
sunderbund
and
how
little
he
thought
of
god
her
he
had
been
assiduously
propitiating
managing
accepting
for
three
months
now
why
partly
because
she
demanded
it
and
there
was
a
quality
in
her
demand
that
had
touched
some
hidden
spring
of
vanity
perhaps
it
was
in
him
that
made
him
respond
but
partly
also
it
was
because
after
the
evacuation
of
the
palace
at
princhester
he
had
felt
more
and
more
felt
but
never
dared
to
look
squarely
in
the
face
the
catastrophic
change
in
the
worldly
circumstances
of
his
family
only
this
chapel
adventure
seemed
likely
to
restore
those
fallen
and
bedraggled
fortunes
he
had
not
anticipated
a
tithe
of
the
dire
quality
of
that
change
they
were
not
simply
uncomfortable
in
the
notting
hill
home
they
were
miserable
he
fancied
they
looked
to
him
with
something
between
reproach
and
urgency
why
had
he
brought
them
here
what
next
did
he
propose
to
do
he
wished
at
times
they
would
say
it
out
instead
of
merely
looking
it
phoebe
failing
appetite
chilled
his
heart
that
concern
for
his
family
he
believed
had
been
his
chief
motive
in
clinging
to
lady
sunderbund
projects
long
after
he
had
realized
how
little
they
would
forward
the
true
service
of
god
no
doubt
there
had
been
moments
of
flattery
moments
of
something
something
rather
in
the
nature
of
an
excited
affection
some
touch
of
the
magnificent
in
her
some
touch
of
the
infantile
both
appealed
magnetically
to
his
imagination
but
the
real
effective
cause
was
his
habitual
solicitude
for
his
wife
and
children
and
his
consequent
desire
to
prosper
materially
as
his
first
dream
of
being
something
between
mohammed
and
peter
the
hermit
in
a
new
proclamation
of
god
to
the
world
lost
colour
and
life
in
his
mind
he
realized
more
and
more
clearly
that
there
was
no
way
of
living
in
a
state
of
material
prosperity
and
at
the
same
time
in
a
state
of
active
service
to
god
the
church
of
the
one
true
god
by
favour
of
lady
sunderbund
was
a
lure
and
yet
he
wanted
to
go
on
with
it
all
his
imagination
and
intelligence
was
busy
now
with
the
possibility
of
in
some
way
subjugating
lady
sunderbund
and
modifying
her
and
qualifying
her
to
an
endurable
proposition
why
why
there
could
be
but
one
answer
he
thought
brought
to
the
test
of
action
he
did
not
really
believe
in
god
he
did
not
believe
in
god
as
he
believed
in
his
family
he
did
not
believe
in
the
reality
of
either
his
first
or
his
second
vision
they
had
been
dreams
autogenous
revelations
exaltations
of
his
own
imaginations
these
beliefs
were
upon
different
grades
of
reality
put
to
the
test
his
faith
in
god
gave
way
a
sword
of
plaster
against
a
reality
of
steel
and
yet
he
did
believe
in
god
he
was
as
persuaded
that
there
was
a
god
as
he
was
that
there
was
another
side
to
the
moon
his
intellectual
conviction
was
complete
only
beside
the
living
breathing
occasionally
coughing
reality
of
phoebe
god
was
something
as
unsubstantial
as
the
binomial
theorem
very
like
the
binomial
theorem
as
one
thought
over
that
comparison
by
this
time
he
had
reached
the
banks
of
the
serpentine
and
was
approaching
the
grey
stone
bridge
that
crosses
just
where
hyde
park
ends
and
kensington
gardens
begins
following
upon
his
doubts
of
his
religious
faith
had
come
another
still
more
extraordinary
question
although
there
is
a
god
does
he
indeed
matter
more
in
our
ordinary
lives
than
that
same
demonstrable
binomial
theorem
is
one
duty
to
phoebe
plain
and
clear
old
likeman
argument
came
back
to
him
with
novel
and
enhanced
powers
was
he
after
all
selfishly
putting
his
own
salvation
in
front
of
his
plain
duty
to
those
about
him
what
did
it
matter
if
he
told
lies
taught
a
false
faith
perjured
and
damned
himself
if
after
all
those
others
were
thereby
saved
and
comforted
but
that
is
just
where
the
whole
of
this
state
of
mind
is
false
and
wrong
he
told
himself
god
is
something
more
than
a
priggish
devotion
an
intellectual
formula
he
has
a
hold
and
a
claim
he
should
have
a
hold
and
a
claim
exceeding
all
the
claims
of
phoebe
miriam
daphne
clementina
all
of
them
but
he
has
it
was
to
that
he
had
got
after
he
had
left
lady
sunderbund
and
to
that
he
now
returned
it
was
the
thinness
and
unreality
of
his
thought
of
god
that
had
driven
him
to
in
search
for
that
drug
that
had
touched
his
soul
to
belief
was
god
so
insignificant
in
comparison
with
his
family
that
after
all
with
a
good
conscience
he
might
preach
him
every
sunday
in
lady
sunderbund
church
wearing
lady
sunderbund
vestments
before
him
he
saw
an
empty
seat
the
question
was
so
immense
and
conclusive
it
was
so
clearly
a
choice
for
all
the
rest
of
his
life
between
god
and
the
dear
things
of
this
world
that
he
felt
he
could
not
decide
it
upon
his
legs
he
sat
down
threw
an
arm
along
the
back
of
the
seat
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
if
the
answer
was
yes
then
it
was
decidedly
a
pity
that
he
had
not
stayed
in
the
church
it
was
ridiculous
to
strain
at
the
cathedral
gnat
and
then
swallow
lady
sunderbund
decorative
pantechnicon
for
the
first
time
scrope
definitely
regretted
his
apostasy
a
trivial
matter
as
it
may
seem
to
the
reader
intensified
that
regret
three
weeks
ago
borrowdale
the
bishop
of
howeaster
had
died
and
scrope
would
have
been
the
next
in
rotation
to
succeed
him
on
the
bench
of
bishops
he
had
always
looked
forward
to
the
house
of
lords
intending
to
take
rather
a
new
line
to
speak
more
and
to
speak
more
plainly
and
fully
upon
social
questions
than
had
hitherto
been
the
practice
of
his
brethren
well
that
had
gone
regrets
were
plain
now
the
question
before
his
mind
was
growing
clear
whether
he
was
to
persist
in
this
martyrdom
of
himself
and
his
family
or
whether
he
was
to
go
back
upon
his
outbreak
of
visionary
fanaticism
and
close
with
this
last
opportunity
that
lady
sunderbund
offered
of
saving
at
least
the
substance
of
the
comfort
and
social
status
of
his
wife
and
daughters
in
which
case
it
was
clear
to
him
he
would
have
to
go
to
great
lengths
and
exercise
very
considerable
subtlety
and
magnetism
in
the
management
of
lady
sunderbund
he
found
himself
composing
a
peculiar
speech
to
her
very
frank
and
revealing
and
one
that
he
felt
would
dominate
her
thoughts
she
attracted
him
oddly
at
least
this
afternoon
she
had
attracted
him
and
repelled
him
a
wholesome
gust
of
moral
impatience
stirred
him
he
smacked
the
back
of
the
seat
hard
as
though
he
smacked
himself
no
he
did
not
like
it
a
torn
sunset
of
purple
and
crimson
streamed
raggedly
up
above
and
through
the
half
stripped
trecs
of
kensington
gardens
and
he
found
himself
wishing
that
heaven
would
give
us
fewer
sublimities
in
sky
and
mountain
and
more
in
our
hearts
against
the
background
of
darkling
trees
and
stormily
flaming
sky
a
girl
was
approaching
him
there
was
little
to
be
seen
of
her
but
her
outline
something
in
her
movement
caught
his
eye
and
carried
his
memory
back
to
a
sundown
at
hunstanton
then
as
she
came
nearer
he
saw
that
it
was
eleanor
it
was
odd
to
see
her
here
he
had
thought
she
was
at
newnham
but
anyhow
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
her
and
there
was
something
in
eleanor
that
promised
an
answer
to
his
necessity
the
girl
had
a
kind
of
instinctive
wisdom
she
would
understand
the
quality
of
his
situation
better
perhaps
than
any
one
he
would
put
the
essentials
of
that
situation
as
fully
and
plainly
as
he
could
to
her
perhaps
she
with
that
clear
young
idealism
of
hers
would
give
him
just
the
lift
and
the
light
of
which
he
stood
in
need
she
would
comprehend
both
sides
of
it
the
points
about
phoebe
as
well
as
the
points
about
god
when
first
he
saw
her
she
seemed
to
be
hurrying
but
now
she
had
fallen
to
a
loitering
pace
she
looked
once
or
twice
behind
her
and
then
ahead
almost
as
though
she
expected
some
one
and
was
not
sure
whether
this
person
would
approach
from
east
or
west
she
did
not
observe
her
father
until
she
was
close
upon
him
then
she
was
so
astonished
that
for
a
moment
she
stood
motionless
regarding
him
she
made
an
odd
movement
almost
as
if
she
would
have
walked
on
that
she
checked
in
its
inception
then
she
came
up
to
him
and
stood
before
him
it
dad
she
said
i
did
know
you
were
in
london
norah
he
began
i
came
up
have
you
been
home
no
i
was
going
home
at
least
not
until
then
she
looked
away
from
him
east
and
then
west
and
then
met
his
eye
again
wo
you
sit
down
norah
i
do
know
whether
i
she
consulted
the
view
again
and
seemed
to
come
to
a
decision
at
least
i
will
for
a
she
sat
down
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
spoke
what
are
you
doing
here
little
norah
she
gathered
her
wits
then
she
spoke
rather
volubly
i
know
it
looks
bad
daddy
i
came
up
to
meet
a
boy
i
know
who
is
going
to
france
i
had
to
make
excuses
up
there
i
hardly
remember
what
excuses
i
a
boy
you
know
do
we
know
him
not
for
a
time
scrope
forgot
the
church
of
the
one
true
god
altogether
who
is
this
boy
he
asked
with
a
perceptible
effort
eleanor
assumed
a
tone
of
commonsense
conventionality
he
a
boy
i
met
first
when
we
were
skating
last
year
his
sister
has
the
study
next
to
father
looked
at
daughter
and
she
met
his
eyes
well
it
all
happened
so
quickly
daddy
she
said
answering
all
that
was
implicit
in
that
well
she
went
on
i
would
have
told
you
about
him
if
he
had
seemed
to
matter
but
it
was
just
a
friendship
it
seem
to
matter
in
any
serious
way
of
course
we
been
good
friends
and
talked
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
then
suddenly
you
see
her
tone
was
offhand
and
he
has
to
go
to
she
stared
at
her
father
with
the
expression
of
a
hostess
who
talks
about
the
weather
and
then
the
tears
gathered
and
ran
down
her
cheek
she
turned
her
face
to
the
serpentine
and
clenched
her
fist
but
she
was
now
fairly
weeping
i
did
know
he
cared
i
did
know
i
his
next
question
took
a
little
time
in
coming
and
it
love
little
norah
he
asked
she
was
comfortably
crying
now
the
defensive
altogether
abandoned
it
love
daddy
oh
love
he
going
for
a
minute
or
so
neither
spoke
scrope
mind
was
entirely
made
up
in
the
matter
he
approved
altogether
of
his
daughter
but
the
traditions
of
parentage
his
habit
of
restrained
decision
made
him
act
a
judicial
part
like
just
to
see
this
boy
he
said
and
added
if
it
is
rather
interfering
dear
daddy
she
said
dear
daddy
and
touched
his
hand
he
be
coming
here
if
you
could
tell
me
a
few
things
about
him
said
scrope
is
he
an
undergraduate
you
see
began
eleanor
and
paused
to
marshal
her
facts
he
graduated
this
year
then
he
been
in
training
at
cambridge
properly
he
have
a
fellowship
he
took
the
natural
science
tripos
zoology
chiefly
he
good
at
philosophy
but
of
course
our
cambridge
philosophy
is
so
silly
mctaggart
blowing
bubbles
his
father
a
doctor
sir
hedley
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
had
been
roving
up
the
path
and
down
coming
she
interrupted
she
hesitated
would
you
mind
if
i
went
and
spoke
to
him
first
daddy
of
course
go
to
him
go
and
warn
him
i
here
said
scrope
eleanor
got
up
and
was
immediately
greeted
with
joyful
gestures
by
an
approaching
figure
in
khaki
the
two
young
people
quickened
their
paces
as
they
drew
nearer
one
another
there
was
a
rapid
greeting
they
stood
close
together
and
spoke
eagerly
scrope
could
tell
by
their
movements
when
he
became
the
subject
of
their
talk
he
saw
the
young
man
start
and
look
over
eleanor
shoulder
and
he
assumed
an
attitude
of
philosophical
contemplation
of
the
water
so
as
to
give
the
young
man
the
liberty
of
his
profile
he
did
not
look
up
until
they
were
quite
close
to
him
and
when
he
did
he
saw
a
pleasant
slightly
freckled
fair
face
a
little
agitated
and
very
honest
blue
eyes
i
hope
you
do
think
sir
that
it
bad
form
of
me
to
ask
eleanor
to
come
up
and
see
me
as
i
done
i
telegraphed
to
her
on
an
impulse
and
it
been
very
kind
of
her
to
come
up
to
sit
down
said
scrope
sit
down
you
riverton
yes
sir
said
the
young
man
he
had
the
frequent
sir
of
the
subaltern
scrope
was
in
the
centre
of
the
seat
and
the
young
officer
sat
down
on
one
side
of
him
while
eleanor
took
up
a
watching
position
on
her
father
other
hand
you
see
sir
we
hardly
known
each
other
i
mean
we
been
associated
over
a
philosophical
society
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
in
a
more
familiar
way
i
mean
he
hung
for
a
moment
just
a
little
short
of
breath
scrope
helped
him
with
a
grave
but
sympathetic
movement
of
the
head
it
a
little
difficult
to
explain
the
young
man
apologized
we
had
understood
i
think
either
of
us
very
much
we
just
been
friendly
and
liked
each
other
and
so
it
went
on
even
when
i
was
training
and
then
when
i
found
i
had
to
go
out
i
going
out
a
little
earlier
than
i
expected
i
thought
suddenly
i
would
ever
go
to
cambridge
again
at
all
perhaps
and
there
was
something
in
one
of
her
letters
i
thought
of
it
a
lot
sir
i
thought
it
all
over
and
i
thought
it
was
right
for
me
to
do
anything
and
i
did
do
anything
until
this
morning
and
then
i
sort
of
had
to
telegraph
i
know
it
was
frightful
cheek
and
bad
form
and
all
that
sir
it
is
it
would
be
worse
if
she
was
different
i
mean
sir
if
she
was
just
an
ordinary
girl
but
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
just
wanting
to
see
her
i
suppose
you
ever
felt
anything
sir
as
i
felt
i
wanted
to
see
her
and
just
hear
her
speak
to
me
he
glanced
across
scrope
at
eleanor
it
was
as
if
he
justified
himself
to
them
both
scrope
glanced
furtively
at
his
daughter
who
was
leaning
forward
with
tender
eyes
on
her
lover
and
his
heart
went
out
to
her
but
his
manner
remained
judicial
all
this
is
very
sudden
he
said
or
you
would
have
heard
all
about
it
sir
said
young
riverton
it
just
the
hurry
that
has
made
this
seem
furtive
all
that
there
is
between
us
sir
is
just
the
two
telegrams
we
sent
hers
and
mine
i
hope
you
wo
mind
our
having
a
little
time
together
we
wo
do
anything
very
committal
it
as
much
friendship
as
anything
i
go
by
the
evening
train
mm
said
serope
with
his
eye
on
eleanor
in
these
uncertain
times
he
began
why
should
i
take
a
risk
too
daddy
said
eleanor
sharply
i
know
there
that
side
of
it
said
the
young
man
i
ought
to
have
telegraphed
he
said
ca
i
take
a
risk
exclaimed
eleanor
i
not
a
doll
i
do
want
to
live
in
wadding
until
all
the
world
is
safe
for
scrope
looked
at
the
glowing
face
of
the
young
man
is
this
taking
care
of
her
he
asked
if
you
had
telegraphed
she
cried
with
a
threat
in
her
voice
and
left
it
at
that
perhaps
i
feel
about
her
rather
as
if
she
was
as
strong
as
i
am
in
those
ways
perhaps
i
should
i
could
hardly
endure
myself
sir
cut
off
from
her
and
a
sort
of
blank
nothing
you
want
to
work
out
your
own
salvation
said
scrope
to
his
daughter
no
one
else
can
she
answered
i
i
grown
even
if
it
hurts
to
live
is
to
be
hurt
somehow
she
said
this
this
she
flashed
her
love
she
intimated
by
a
gesture
that
it
is
better
to
be
stabbed
with
a
clean
knife
than
to
be
suffocated
or
poisoned
or
to
decay
scrope
turned
his
eyes
to
the
young
man
again
he
liked
him
he
liked
the
modelling
of
his
mouth
and
chin
and
the
line
of
his
brows
he
liked
him
altogether
he
pronounced
his
verdict
slowly
i
suppose
after
all
he
said
that
this
is
better
than
the
tender
solicitude
of
a
safe
and
prosperous
middleaged
man
eleanor
my
dear
i
been
thinking
that
a
father
who
stands
between
his
children
and
hardship
by
doing
wrong
may
really
be
doing
them
a
wrong
you
are
a
dear
girl
to
me
i
wo
stand
between
you
two
find
your
own
he
got
up
i
go
west
he
said
presently
you
i
think
go
i
can
assure
you
sir
the
young
man
began
scrope
held
his
hand
out
take
your
life
in
your
own
way
he
said
he
turned
to
eleanor
talk
as
you
will
he
said
she
clasped
his
hand
with
emotion
then
she
turned
to
the
waiting
young
man
who
saluted
you
come
back
to
supper
scrope
said
without
thinking
out
the
implications
of
that
invitation
she
assented
as
carelessly
the
fact
that
she
and
her
lover
were
to
go
with
their
meeting
legalized
and
blessed
excluded
all
other
considerations
the
two
young
people
turned
to
each
other
scrope
stood
for
a
moment
or
so
and
then
sat
down
again
for
a
time
he
could
think
only
of
eleanor
he
watched
the
two
young
people
as
they
went
eastward
as
they
walked
their
shoulders
and
elbows
bumped
amicably
together
presently
he
sought
to
resume
the
interrupted
thread
of
his
thoughts
he
knew
that
he
had
been
dealing
with
some
very
tremendous
and
urgent
problem
when
eleanor
had
appeared
then
he
remembered
that
eleanor
at
the
time
of
her
approach
had
seemed
to
be
a
solution
rather
than
an
interruption
well
she
had
her
own
life
she
was
making
her
own
life
instead
of
solving
his
problems
she
was
solving
her
own
god
bless
those
dear
grave
children
they
were
nearer
the
elemental
things
than
he
was
that
eastward
path
led
to
victoria
and
thence
to
a
very
probable
death
the
lad
was
in
the
infantry
and
going
straight
into
the
trenches
love
death
god
this
war
was
bringing
the
whole
world
back
to
elemental
things
to
heroic
things
the
years
of
comedy
and
comfort
were
at
an
end
in
europe
the
age
of
steel
and
want
was
here
and
he
had
been
thinking
what
had
he
been
thinking
he
mused
and
the
scheme
of
his
perplexities
reshaped
itself
in
his
mind
but
at
that
time
he
did
not
realize
that
a
powerful
new
light
was
falling
upon
it
now
cast
by
the
tragic
illumination
of
these
young
lovers
whose
love
began
with
a
parting
he
did
not
see
how
reality
had
come
to
all
things
through
that
one
intense
reality
he
reverted
to
the
question
as
he
had
put
it
to
himself
before
first
he
recognized
eleanor
did
he
believe
in
god
should
he
go
on
with
this
sunderbund
adventure
in
which
he
no
longer
believed
should
he
play
for
safety
and
comfort
trusting
to
god
toleration
or
go
back
to
his
family
and
warn
them
of
the
years
of
struggle
and
poverty
his
renunciation
cast
upon
them
somehow
lady
sunderbund
chapel
was
very
remote
and
flimsy
now
and
the
hardships
of
poverty
seemed
less
black
than
the
hardship
of
a
youthful
death
did
he
believe
in
god
again
he
put
that
fundamental
question
to
himself
he
sat
very
still
in
the
sunset
peace
with
his
eyes
upon
the
steel
mirror
of
the
waters
the
question
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
scene
to
wait
even
as
the
water
and
sky
and
the
windless
trees
were
waiting
and
then
by
imperceptible
degrees
there
grew
in
scrope
mind
the
persuasion
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
living
god
this
time
there
was
no
vision
of
angels
nor
stars
no
snapping
of
no
throbbing
of
the
heart
nor
change
of
scene
no
magic
and
melodramatic
drawing
back
of
the
curtain
from
the
mysteries
the
water
and
the
bridge
the
ragged
black
trees
and
a
distant
boat
that
broke
the
silvery
calm
with
an
arrow
of
black
ripples
all
these
things
were
still
before
him
but
god
was
there
too
god
was
everywhere
about
him
this
persuasion
was
over
him
and
about
him
a
dome
of
protection
a
power
in
his
nerves
a
peace
in
his
heart
it
was
an
exalting
beauty
it
was
a
perfected
conviction
this
indeed
was
the
coming
of
god
the
real
coming
of
god
for
the
first
time
scrope
was
absolutely
sure
that
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
possess
god
everything
that
had
so
perplexed
him
seemed
to
be
clear
now
and
his
troubles
lay
at
the
foot
of
this
last
complete
realization
like
a
litter
of
dust
and
leaves
in
the
foreground
of
a
sunlit
snowy
mountain
range
it
was
a
little
incredible
that
he
could
ever
have
doubted
it
was
a
phase
of
extreme
intellectual
clairvoyance
a
multitude
of
things
that
hitherto
had
been
contradictory
and
incongruous
in
his
mind
became
lucid
serene
full
and
assured
he
seemed
to
see
all
things
plainly
as
one
sees
things
plainly
through
perfectly
clear
still
water
in
the
shadows
of
a
summer
noon
his
doubts
about
god
his
periods
of
complete
forgetfulness
and
disregard
of
god
this
conflict
of
his
instincts
and
the
habits
and
affections
of
his
daily
life
with
the
service
of
god
ceased
to
be
perplexing
incompatibilities
and
were
manifest
as
necessary
understandable
aspects
of
the
business
of
living
it
was
no
longer
a
riddle
that
little
immediate
things
should
seem
of
more
importance
than
great
and
final
things
for
man
is
a
creature
thrusting
his
way
up
from
the
beast
to
divinity
from
the
blindness
of
individuality
to
the
knowledge
of
a
common
end
we
stand
deep
in
the
engagements
of
our
individual
lives
looking
up
to
god
and
only
realizing
in
our
moments
of
exaltation
that
through
god
we
can
escape
from
and
rule
and
alter
the
whole
scheme
of
individual
lives
only
in
phases
of
illumination
do
we
realize
the
creative
powers
that
lie
ready
to
man
hand
personal
affections
immediate
obligations
ambitions
these
are
among
the
natural
and
essential
things
of
our
individual
lives
as
intimate
almost
as
our
primordial
lusts
and
needs
god
the
true
god
is
a
later
revelation
a
newer
less
natural
thing
in
us
a
knowledge
still
remote
uncertain
and
confused
with
superstition
an
apprehension
as
yet
entangled
with
barbaric
traditions
of
fear
and
with
ceremonial
surgeries
blood
sacrifices
and
the
maddest
barbarities
of
thought
we
are
only
beginning
to
realize
that
god
is
here
so
far
as
our
minds
go
he
is
still
not
here
continually
we
perceive
him
and
then
again
we
are
blind
to
him
god
is
the
last
thing
added
to
the
completeness
of
human
life
to
most
his
presence
is
imperceptible
throughout
their
lives
they
know
as
little
of
him
as
a
savage
knows
of
the
electric
waves
that
beat
through
us
for
ever
from
the
sun
all
this
appeared
now
so
clear
and
necessary
to
scrope
that
he
was
astonished
he
had
ever
found
the
quality
of
contradiction
in
these
manifest
facts
in
this
unprecedented
lucidity
that
had
now
come
to
him
scrope
saw
as
a
clear
and
simple
necessity
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
continuous
living
presence
of
god
in
our
lives
that
is
an
unreasonable
desire
there
is
no
permanent
exaltation
of
belief
it
is
contrary
to
the
nature
of
life
one
can
not
keep
actively
believing
in
and
realizing
god
round
all
the
hours
any
more
than
one
can
keep
awake
through
the
whole
cycle
of
night
and
day
day
after
day
if
it
were
possible
so
to
apprehend
god
without
cessation
life
would
dissolve
in
religious
ecstasy
but
nothing
human
has
ever
had
the
power
to
hold
the
curtain
of
sense
continually
aside
and
retain
the
light
of
god
always
we
must
get
along
by
remembering
our
moments
of
assurance
even
jesus
himself
leader
of
all
those
who
have
hailed
the
coming
kingdom
of
god
had
cried
upon
the
cross
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
the
business
of
life
on
earth
life
itself
is
a
thing
curtained
off
as
it
were
from
such
immediate
convictions
that
is
in
the
constitution
of
life
our
ordinary
state
of
belief
even
when
we
are
free
from
doubt
is
necessarily
far
removed
from
the
intuitive
certainty
of
sight
and
hearing
it
is
a
persuasion
it
falls
far
short
of
perception
we
do
know
directly
scrope
said
to
himself
with
a
checking
gesture
of
the
hand
we
do
see
we
ca
we
hold
on
to
the
remembered
glimpse
we
go
over
our
and
it
was
clear
too
just
because
god
is
thus
manifest
like
the
momentary
drawing
of
a
curtain
sometimes
to
this
man
for
a
time
and
sometimes
to
that
but
never
continuously
to
any
and
because
the
perception
of
him
depends
upon
the
ability
and
quality
of
the
perceiver
because
to
the
intellectual
man
god
is
necessarily
a
formula
to
the
active
man
a
will
and
a
commandment
and
to
the
emotional
man
love
there
can
be
no
creed
defining
him
for
all
men
and
no
ritual
and
special
forms
of
service
to
justify
a
priesthood
god
is
god
he
whispered
to
himself
and
the
phrase
seemed
to
him
the
discovery
of
a
sufficient
creed
god
is
his
own
definition
there
is
no
other
definition
of
god
scrope
had
troubled
himself
with
endless
arguments
whether
god
was
a
person
whether
he
was
concerned
with
personal
troubles
whether
he
loved
whether
he
was
finite
it
were
as
reasonable
to
argue
whether
god
was
a
frog
or
a
rock
or
a
tree
he
had
imagined
god
as
a
figure
of
youth
and
courage
had
perceived
him
as
an
effulgence
of
leadership
a
captain
like
the
sun
the
vision
of
his
mind
had
but
symbolized
what
was
otherwise
inexpressible
of
that
he
was
now
sure
he
had
not
seen
the
invisible
but
only
its
sign
and
visible
likeness
he
knew
now
that
all
such
presentations
were
true
and
that
all
such
presentations
were
false
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
was
god
the
darkness
and
the
brightness
of
the
ripples
under
the
bows
of
the
distant
boat
the
black
beauty
of
the
leaves
and
twigs
of
those
trees
now
against
the
flushed
and
deepening
sky
these
riddles
of
the
profundities
were
beyond
the
compass
of
common
living
they
were
beyond
the
needs
of
common
living
he
was
but
a
little
earth
parasite
sitting
idle
in
the
darkling
day
trying
to
understand
his
infinitesimal
functions
on
a
minor
planet
within
the
compass
of
terrestrial
living
god
showed
himself
in
its
own
terms
the
life
of
man
on
earth
was
a
struggle
for
unity
of
spirit
and
for
unity
with
his
kind
and
the
aspect
of
god
that
alone
mattered
to
man
was
a
unifying
kingship
without
and
within
so
long
as
men
were
men
so
would
they
see
god
only
when
they
reached
the
crest
could
they
begin
to
look
beyond
so
we
knew
god
so
god
was
to
us
since
we
struggled
he
led
our
struggle
since
we
were
finite
and
mortal
he
defined
an
aim
his
personality
was
the
answer
to
our
personality
but
god
except
in
so
far
as
he
was
to
us
remained
inaccessible
inexplicable
wonderful
shining
through
beauty
shining
beyond
research
greater
than
time
or
space
above
good
and
evil
and
pain
and
pleasure
serope
mind
was
saturated
as
it
had
never
been
before
by
his
sense
of
the
immediate
presence
of
god
he
floated
in
that
realization
he
was
not
so
much
thinking
now
as
conversing
starkly
with
the
divine
interlocutor
who
penetrated
all
things
and
saw
into
and
illuminated
every
recess
of
his
mind
he
spread
out
his
ideas
to
the
test
of
this
presence
he
brought
out
his
hazards
and
interpretations
that
this
light
might
judge
them
there
came
back
to
his
mind
the
substance
of
his
two
former
visions
they
assumed
now
a
reciprocal
quality
they
explained
one
another
and
the
riddle
before
him
the
first
had
shown
him
the
personal
human
aspect
of
god
he
had
seen
god
as
the
unifying
captain
calling
for
his
personal
service
the
second
had
set
the
stage
for
that
service
in
the
spectacle
of
mankind
adventure
he
had
been
shown
a
great
multitude
of
human
spirits
reaching
up
at
countless
points
towards
the
conception
of
the
racial
unity
under
a
divine
leadership
he
had
seen
mankind
on
the
verge
of
awakening
to
the
kingdom
of
god
that
solves
no
mystery
he
whispered
gripping
the
seat
and
frowning
at
the
water
mysteries
remain
mysteries
but
that
is
the
reality
of
religion
and
now
now
what
is
my
place
what
have
i
to
do
that
is
the
question
i
have
been
asking
always
the
question
that
this
moment
now
will
answer
what
have
i
to
do
god
was
coming
into
the
life
of
all
mankind
in
the
likeness
of
a
captain
and
a
king
all
the
governments
of
men
all
the
leagues
of
men
their
debts
and
claims
and
possessions
must
give
way
to
the
world
republic
under
god
the
king
for
five
troubled
years
he
had
been
staring
religion
in
the
face
and
now
he
saw
that
it
must
mean
this
or
be
no
more
than
fetishism
obi
orphic
mysteries
or
ceremonies
of
demeter
a
legacy
of
mental
dirtiness
a
residue
of
and
superstitious
sacrifices
from
the
cunning
phase
of
human
development
but
it
did
mean
this
and
every
one
who
apprehended
as
much
was
called
by
that
very
apprehension
to
the
service
of
god
kingdom
to
live
and
serve
god
kingdom
on
earth
to
help
to
bring
it
about
to
propagate
the
idea
of
it
to
establish
the
method
of
it
to
incorporate
all
that
one
made
and
all
that
one
did
into
its
growing
reality
was
the
only
possible
life
that
could
be
lived
once
that
god
was
known
he
sat
with
his
hands
gripping
his
knees
as
if
he
were
holding
on
to
his
idea
and
now
for
my
part
he
whispered
brows
knit
now
for
my
ever
since
he
had
given
his
confirmation
addresses
he
had
been
clear
that
his
task
or
at
least
a
considerable
portion
of
his
task
was
to
tell
of
this
faith
in
god
and
of
this
conception
of
service
in
his
kingdom
as
the
form
and
rule
of
human
life
and
human
society
but
up
to
now
he
had
been
floundering
hopelessly
in
his
search
for
a
method
and
means
of
telling
that
he
saw
still
needed
to
be
thought
out
for
example
one
can
not
run
through
the
world
crying
the
kingdom
of
god
is
at
men
minds
were
still
so
filled
with
old
theological
ideas
that
for
the
most
part
they
would
understand
by
that
only
a
fantasy
of
some
great
coming
of
angels
and
fiery
chariots
and
judgments
and
hardly
a
soul
but
would
doubt
one
sanity
and
turn
scornfully
away
but
one
must
proclaim
god
not
to
confuse
but
to
convince
men
minds
it
was
that
and
the
habit
of
his
priestly
calling
that
had
disposed
him
towards
a
pulpit
there
he
could
reason
and
explain
the
decorative
genius
of
lady
sunderbund
had
turned
that
intention
into
a
vast
iridescent
absurdity
this
sense
he
had
of
thinking
openly
in
the
sight
of
god
enabled
him
to
see
the
adventure
of
lady
sunderbund
without
illusion
and
without
shame
he
saw
himself
at
once
honest
and
disingenuous
divided
between
two
aims
he
had
no
doubt
now
of
the
path
he
had
to
pursue
a
stronger
man
of
permanently
clear
aims
might
possibly
turn
lady
sunderbund
into
a
useful
opportunity
oblige
her
to
provide
the
rostrum
he
needed
but
for
himself
he
knew
he
had
neither
the
needed
strength
nor
clearness
she
would
smother
him
in
decoration
overcome
him
by
her
picturesque
persistence
it
might
be
ridiculous
to
run
away
from
her
but
it
was
necessary
and
he
was
equally
clear
now
that
for
him
there
must
be
no
idea
of
any
pulpit
of
any
sustained
mission
he
was
a
man
of
intellectual
moods
only
at
times
he
realized
had
he
the
inspiration
of
truth
upon
such
uncertain
snatches
and
glimpses
he
must
live
to
make
his
life
a
ministry
would
be
to
face
phases
when
he
would
simply
be
carrying
on
with
his
mind
blank
and
his
faith
asleep
his
thought
spread
out
from
this
perennial
decision
to
more
general
things
again
had
god
any
need
of
organized
priests
at
all
was
that
just
what
had
been
the
matter
with
religion
for
the
last
three
thousand
years
his
vision
and
his
sense
of
access
to
god
had
given
a
new
courage
to
his
mind
in
these
moods
of
enlightenment
he
could
see
the
world
as
a
comprehensible
ball
he
could
see
history
as
an
understandable
drama
he
had
always
been
on
the
verge
of
realizing
before
he
realized
now
the
two
entirely
different
and
antagonistic
strands
that
interweave
in
the
twisted
rope
of
contemporary
religion
the
old
strand
of
the
priest
the
fetishistic
element
of
the
blood
sacrifice
and
the
obscene
rite
the
element
of
ritual
and
tradition
of
the
cult
the
caste
the
consecrated
tribe
and
interwoven
with
this
so
closely
as
to
be
scarcely
separable
in
any
existing
religion
was
the
new
strand
the
religion
of
the
prophets
the
unidolatrous
universal
worship
of
the
one
true
god
priest
religion
is
the
antithesis
to
prophet
religion
he
saw
that
the
founders
of
all
the
great
existing
religions
of
the
world
had
been
like
himself
only
that
he
was
a
weak
and
commonplace
man
with
no
creative
force
and
they
had
been
great
men
of
enormous
initiative
men
reaching
out
and
never
with
a
complete
definition
from
the
old
kind
of
religion
to
the
new
the
hebrew
prophets
jesus
whom
the
priests
killed
when
pilate
would
have
spared
him
mohammed
buddha
had
this
much
in
common
that
they
had
sought
to
lead
men
from
temple
worship
idol
worship
from
rites
and
ceremonies
and
the
rule
of
priests
from
anniversaryism
and
sacramentalism
into
a
direct
and
simple
relation
to
the
simplicity
of
god
religious
progress
had
always
been
liberation
and
simplification
but
none
of
these
efforts
had
got
altogether
clear
the
organizing
temper
in
men
the
disposition
to
dogmatic
theorizing
the
distrust
of
the
discretion
of
the
young
by
the
wisdom
of
age
the
fear
of
indiscipline
which
is
so
just
in
warfare
and
so
foolish
in
education
the
tremendous
power
of
the
propitiatory
tradition
had
always
caught
and
crippled
every
new
gospel
before
it
had
run
a
score
of
years
jesus
for
example
gave
man
neither
a
theology
nor
a
church
organization
his
sacrament
was
an
innocent
feast
of
memorial
but
the
fearful
limited
imitative
men
he
left
to
carry
on
his
work
speedily
restored
all
these
three
abominations
of
the
antiquated
religion
theology
priest
and
sacrifice
jesus
indeed
caught
into
identification
with
the
ancient
victim
of
the
harvest
sacrifice
and
turned
from
a
plain
teacher
into
a
horrible
blood
bath
and
a
mock
cannibal
meal
was
surely
the
supreme
feat
of
the
ironies
of
chance
it
is
curious
how
i
drift
back
to
jesus
said
scrope
i
have
never
seen
how
much
truth
and
good
there
was
in
his
teaching
until
i
broke
away
from
christianity
and
began
to
see
him
plain
if
i
go
on
as
i
am
going
i
shall
end
a
nazarene
he
thought
on
he
had
a
feeling
of
temerity
but
then
it
seemed
as
if
god
within
him
bade
him
be
of
good
courage
already
in
a
glow
of
inspiration
he
had
said
practically
as
much
as
he
was
now
thinking
in
his
confirmation
address
but
now
he
realized
completely
what
it
was
he
had
then
said
there
could
be
no
priests
no
specialized
ministers
of
the
one
true
god
because
every
man
to
the
utmost
measure
of
his
capacity
was
bound
to
be
god
priest
and
minister
many
things
one
may
leave
to
specialists
surgery
detailed
administration
chemistry
for
example
but
it
is
for
every
man
to
think
his
own
philosophy
and
think
out
his
own
religion
one
man
may
tell
another
but
no
man
may
take
charge
of
another
a
man
may
avail
himself
of
electrician
or
gardener
or
what
not
but
he
must
stand
directly
before
god
he
may
suffer
neither
priest
nor
king
these
other
things
are
incidental
but
god
the
kingdom
of
god
is
what
he
is
for
good
he
said
checking
his
reasoning
so
i
must
bear
witness
to
god
but
neither
as
priest
nor
pastor
i
must
write
and
talk
about
him
as
i
can
no
reason
why
i
should
not
live
by
such
writing
and
talking
if
it
does
not
hamper
my
message
to
do
so
but
there
must
be
no
high
place
no
ordered
congregation
i
begin
to
see
my
way
the
evening
was
growing
dark
and
chill
about
him
now
the
sky
was
barred
with
deep
bluish
purple
bands
drawn
across
a
chilly
brightness
that
had
already
forgotten
the
sun
the
trees
were
black
and
dim
but
his
understanding
of
his
place
and
duty
was
growing
very
definite
and
this
duty
to
bear
witness
to
god
kingdom
and
serve
it
is
so
plain
that
i
must
not
deflect
my
witness
even
by
a
little
though
to
do
so
means
comfort
and
security
for
my
wife
and
children
god
comes
first
they
must
not
come
between
god
and
me
but
there
is
more
in
it
than
he
had
come
round
at
last
through
the
long
of
his
mind
to
his
fundamental
problem
again
he
sat
darkly
reluctant
i
must
not
play
priest
or
providence
to
them
he
admitted
at
last
i
must
not
even
stand
between
god
and
he
saw
now
what
he
had
been
doing
it
had
been
the
flaw
in
his
faith
that
he
would
not
trust
his
family
to
god
and
he
saw
too
that
this
distrust
has
been
the
flaw
in
the
faith
of
all
religious
systems
hitherto
in
this
strange
voyage
of
the
spirit
which
was
now
drawing
to
its
end
in
which
scrope
had
travelled
from
the
confused
unanalyzed
formulas
and
assumptions
and
implications
of
his
rectory
upbringing
to
his
present
stark
and
simple
realization
of
god
he
had
at
times
made
some
remarkable
he
was
naturally
much
given
to
analogy
every
train
of
thought
in
his
mind
set
up
induced
parallel
currents
he
had
likened
himself
to
the
anglican
church
to
the
whole
christian
body
as
for
example
in
his
imagined
second
conversation
with
the
angel
of
god
but
now
he
found
himself
associating
himself
with
a
still
more
section
of
mankind
this
excess
of
solicitude
was
traceable
perhaps
in
nearly
every
one
in
all
the
past
of
mankind
who
had
ever
had
the
vision
of
god
an
excessive
solicitude
to
shield
those
others
from
one
own
trials
and
hardships
to
preserve
the
exact
quality
of
the
revelation
for
example
had
been
the
fruitful
cause
of
crippling
errors
spiritual
tyrannies
dogmatisms
dissensions
and
futilities
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
the
text
came
into
his
head
with
an
effect
of
contribution
the
parent
in
us
all
flares
out
at
the
thought
of
the
younger
and
weaker
minds
we
hide
difficulties
seek
to
spare
them
from
the
fires
that
temper
the
spirit
the
sharp
edge
of
the
truth
that
shapes
the
soul
christian
is
always
trying
to
have
a
carriage
sent
back
from
the
celestial
city
for
his
family
why
we
ask
should
they
flounder
dangerously
in
the
morasses
that
we
escaped
or
wander
in
the
forest
in
which
we
lost
ourselves
catch
these
souls
young
therefore
save
them
before
they
know
they
exist
kidnap
them
to
heaven
vaccinate
them
with
a
catechism
they
may
never
understand
lull
them
into
comfort
and
routine
instinct
plays
us
false
here
as
it
plays
the
savage
mother
false
when
she
snatches
her
fevered
child
from
the
doctor
hands
the
last
act
of
faith
is
to
trust
those
we
love
to
god
hitherto
he
had
seen
the
great
nets
of
theological
overstatement
and
dogma
that
kept
mankind
from
god
as
if
they
were
the
work
of
purely
evil
things
in
man
of
pride
of
of
a
desire
to
possess
and
dominate
the
minds
and
souls
of
others
it
was
only
now
that
he
saw
how
large
a
share
in
the
obstruction
of
god
kingdom
had
been
played
by
the
love
of
the
elder
and
the
parent
by
the
carefulness
the
fussy
care
of
good
men
and
women
he
had
wandered
in
wildernesses
of
unbelief
in
dangerous
places
of
doubt
and
questioning
but
he
had
left
his
wife
and
children
safe
and
secure
in
the
of
orthodoxy
to
none
of
them
except
to
eleanor
had
he
ever
talked
with
any
freedom
of
his
new
apprehensions
of
religious
reality
and
that
had
been
at
initiative
there
was
he
saw
now
something
of
insolence
and
something
of
treachery
in
this
concealment
his
ruling
disposition
throughout
the
crisis
had
been
to
force
comfort
and
worldly
upon
all
those
dependants
even
at
the
price
of
his
own
spiritual
integrity
in
no
way
had
he
consulted
them
upon
the
bargain
while
we
have
pottered
each
for
the
little
good
of
his
own
family
each
for
the
lessons
and
clothes
and
leisure
of
his
own
children
assenting
to
this
injustice
conforming
to
that
dishonest
custom
being
myopically
benevolent
and
fundamentally
treacherous
our
accumulated
folly
has
achieved
this
catastrophe
it
is
not
so
much
human
wickedness
as
human
weakness
that
has
permitted
the
youth
of
the
world
to
go
through
this
hell
of
blood
and
mud
and
fire
the
way
to
the
kingdom
of
god
is
the
only
way
to
the
true
safety
the
true
wellbeing
of
the
children
of
men
it
was
fair
to
them
but
now
he
saw
how
unfair
it
was
to
them
in
a
light
that
has
only
shone
plainly
upon
european
life
since
the
great
interlude
of
the
armed
peace
came
to
an
end
in
august
until
that
time
it
had
been
the
fashion
to
ignore
death
and
evade
poverty
and
necessity
for
the
young
we
can
shield
our
young
no
longer
death
has
broken
through
our
precautions
and
tender
evasions
and
his
eyes
went
eastward
into
the
twilight
that
had
swallowed
up
his
daughter
and
her
lover
the
tumbled
darkling
sky
monstrous
masses
of
frowning
blue
with
icy
gaps
of
cold
light
was
like
the
great
confusions
of
the
war
all
our
youth
has
had
to
go
into
that
terrible
and
destructive
chaos
because
of
the
kings
and
churches
and
nationalities
men
would
have
set
aside
everything
was
sharp
and
clear
in
his
mind
now
eleanor
after
all
had
brought
him
his
solution
he
sat
quite
still
for
a
little
while
and
then
stood
up
and
turned
northward
towards
notting
hill
the
keepers
were
closing
kensington
gardens
and
he
would
have
to
skirt
the
park
to
victoria
gate
and
go
home
by
the
bayswater
road
as
he
walked
he
rearranged
in
his
mind
this
apology
for
his
faith
that
he
was
presently
to
make
to
his
family
there
was
no
one
to
interrupt
him
and
nothing
to
embarrass
him
and
so
he
was
able
to
set
out
everything
very
clearly
and
convincingly
there
was
perhaps
a
disposition
to
digress
into
rather
voluminous
subordinate
explanations
on
such
themes
for
instance
as
sacramentalism
whereon
he
found
himself
summarizing
frazer
golden
bough
which
the
controversy
had
first
obliged
him
to
read
and
upon
the
irrelevance
of
the
question
of
immortality
to
the
process
of
salvation
but
the
reality
of
his
eclaircissement
was
very
different
from
anything
he
prepared
in
these
anticipations
tea
had
been
finished
and
put
away
and
the
family
was
disposed
about
the
engaged
in
various
evening
occupations
phoebe
sat
at
the
table
working
at
some
mathematical
problem
clementina
was
reading
with
her
chin
on
her
fist
and
a
frown
on
her
brow
lady
ella
miriam
and
daphne
were
busy
making
soft
washing
cloths
for
the
wounded
lady
ella
had
brought
home
the
demand
for
them
from
the
red
cross
centre
in
burlington
house
the
family
was
all
downstairs
in
the
because
the
evening
was
chilly
and
there
were
no
fires
upstairs
yet
in
the
he
came
into
the
room
and
exchanged
greetings
with
lady
ella
then
he
stood
for
a
time
surveying
his
children
phoebe
he
noted
was
a
little
flushed
she
put
passion
into
her
work
on
the
whole
she
was
more
like
eleanor
than
any
other
of
them
miriam
knitted
with
a
steady
skill
clementina
face
too
expressed
a
tussle
he
took
up
one
of
the
upon
the
and
asked
how
many
could
be
made
in
an
hour
then
he
asked
some
idle
obvious
question
about
the
fire
upstairs
clementina
made
an
involuntary
movement
he
was
disturbing
her
he
hovered
for
a
moment
longer
he
wanted
to
catch
his
wife
eye
and
speak
to
her
first
she
looked
up
but
before
he
could
convey
his
wish
for
a
private
conference
with
her
she
smiled
at
him
and
then
bent
over
her
work
again
he
went
into
the
back
study
and
lit
his
gas
fire
hitherto
he
had
always
made
a
considerable
explosion
when
he
did
so
but
this
time
by
taking
thought
and
lighting
his
match
before
he
turned
on
the
gas
he
did
it
with
only
a
gentle
thud
then
he
lit
his
and
pulled
down
the
blind
pausing
for
a
time
to
look
at
the
lit
dressmaker
opposite
then
he
sat
down
thoughtfully
before
the
fire
presently
ella
would
come
in
and
he
would
talk
to
her
he
waited
a
long
time
thinking
only
weakly
and
inconsecutively
and
then
he
became
restless
should
he
call
her
but
he
wanted
their
talk
to
begin
in
a
way
he
did
not
want
the
portentousness
of
wanting
to
speak
to
her
and
calling
her
out
to
him
he
got
up
at
last
and
went
back
into
the
other
room
clementina
had
gone
upstairs
and
the
book
she
had
been
reading
was
lying
closed
on
the
sideboard
he
saw
it
was
one
of
chasters
books
he
took
it
up
it
was
the
core
of
truth
in
christianity
and
he
felt
an
irrational
shock
at
the
idea
of
clementina
reading
it
in
spite
of
his
own
immense
changes
of
opinion
he
had
still
to
revise
his
conception
of
the
polemical
chasters
as
an
evil
influence
in
religion
he
fidgeted
past
his
wife
to
the
mantel
in
search
of
an
imaginary
mislaid
pencil
clementina
came
down
with
some
bandage
linen
she
was
cutting
out
he
hung
over
his
wife
in
a
way
that
he
felt
must
convey
his
desire
for
a
conversation
then
he
picked
up
chasters
book
again
does
any
one
want
this
he
asked
not
if
i
may
have
it
again
consented
clementina
he
took
it
back
with
him
and
began
to
read
again
those
familiar
controversial
pages
he
read
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
with
his
knees
drying
until
they
smoked
over
the
gas
what
curious
stuff
it
was
how
it
wrangled
was
chasters
a
religious
man
why
did
he
write
these
books
had
he
really
a
passion
for
truth
or
only
a
hatred
of
people
none
of
this
stuff
in
his
books
was
really
wrong
provided
it
was
much
of
it
had
been
indeed
destructively
illuminating
to
its
reader
it
let
daylight
through
all
sorts
of
walls
indeed
the
more
one
read
the
more
vividly
true
its
lines
became
and
yet
and
yet
there
was
something
hateful
in
the
man
tone
scrope
held
the
book
and
thought
he
had
seen
chasters
once
or
twice
chasters
had
the
sort
of
face
the
sort
of
voice
the
sort
of
bearing
that
made
one
think
of
his
possibly
saying
upon
occasion
rudely
and
rejoicing
more
fool
you
nevertheless
scrope
perceived
now
with
an
effort
of
discovery
that
it
was
from
chasters
that
he
had
taken
all
the
leading
ideas
of
the
new
faith
that
was
in
him
here
was
the
stuff
of
it
he
had
forgotten
how
much
of
it
was
here
during
those
months
of
worried
study
while
the
threat
of
a
chasters
prosecution
hung
over
him
his
mind
had
assimilated
almost
unknowingly
every
assimilable
element
of
the
chasters
doctrine
he
had
either
assimilated
and
transmuted
it
by
the
alchemy
of
his
own
temperament
or
he
had
reacted
obviously
and
filled
in
chasters
gaps
and
pauses
chasters
could
beat
a
road
to
the
holy
of
holies
and
shy
at
entering
it
but
in
spite
of
all
the
man
roughness
in
spite
of
a
curious
flavour
of
baseness
and
malice
about
him
the
spirit
of
truth
had
spoken
through
him
god
has
a
use
for
harsh
ministers
in
one
man
god
lights
the
heart
in
another
the
reason
becomes
a
consuming
fire
god
takes
his
own
where
he
finds
it
he
does
not
limit
himself
to
nice
people
in
these
matters
of
evidence
and
argument
in
his
contempt
for
amiable
demoralizing
compromise
chasters
served
god
as
scrope
could
never
hope
to
serve
him
scrope
new
faith
had
perhaps
been
altogether
impossible
if
the
chasters
controversy
had
not
ploughed
his
mind
for
a
time
scrope
dwelt
upon
this
remarkable
realization
then
as
he
turned
over
the
pages
his
eyes
rested
on
a
passage
of
uncivil
and
ungenerous
sarcasm
against
old
likeman
of
all
people
what
did
a
girl
like
clementina
make
of
all
this
how
had
she
got
the
book
from
eleanor
the
stuff
had
not
hurt
eleanor
eleanor
had
been
able
to
take
the
good
that
chasters
taught
and
reject
the
evil
of
his
spirit
he
thought
of
eleanor
gallantly
working
out
her
own
salvation
the
world
was
moving
fast
to
a
phase
of
great
freedom
for
the
young
and
the
bold
he
liked
that
boy
his
thoughts
came
back
with
a
start
to
his
wife
the
evening
was
slipping
by
and
he
had
momentous
things
to
say
to
her
he
went
and
just
opened
the
door
ella
he
said
did
you
want
me
she
put
a
liberal
interpretation
upon
that
presently
so
that
after
what
seemed
to
him
a
long
interval
he
had
to
call
again
ella
just
a
minute
she
answered
lady
ella
was
still
so
to
speak
a
little
in
the
other
room
when
she
came
to
him
shut
that
door
please
he
said
and
felt
the
request
had
just
that
flavour
of
portentousness
he
wished
to
avoid
what
is
it
she
asked
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
some
things
i
done
something
rather
serious
i
made
an
important
her
face
became
anxious
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
you
see
he
said
leaning
upon
the
mantelshelf
and
looking
down
at
the
gas
flames
i
never
thought
that
we
should
all
have
to
live
in
this
crowded
house
for
all
she
interrupted
in
a
voice
that
made
him
look
up
sharply
not
going
away
ted
oh
no
but
i
hoped
we
should
all
be
going
away
in
a
little
time
it
is
i
never
quite
understood
why
you
hoped
it
was
plain
how
i
thought
i
should
have
found
something
to
do
that
would
have
enabled
us
to
live
in
better
style
i
had
a
what
plan
it
fallen
but
what
plan
was
it
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
set
up
a
sort
of
broad
church
chapel
i
had
a
her
voice
was
rich
with
indignation
and
she
has
betrayed
you
no
he
said
i
have
betrayed
lady
ella
face
showed
them
still
at
cross
purposes
he
looked
down
again
and
frowned
i
ca
do
that
chapel
business
he
said
i
had
to
let
her
down
i
got
to
let
you
all
down
there
no
help
for
it
it
is
the
way
i
ca
have
anything
to
do
with
lady
sunderbund
and
her
but
lady
ella
was
still
perplexed
it
too
great
a
of
us
no
of
myself
i
ca
get
into
her
pulpit
and
do
as
she
wants
and
keep
my
conscience
it
been
a
horrible
riddle
for
me
it
means
plunging
into
all
this
poverty
for
good
but
i
ca
work
with
her
ella
you
mean
you
going
to
break
with
lady
sunderbund
i
then
teddy
she
was
a
woman
groping
for
flight
amidst
intolerable
perplexities
why
did
you
ever
leave
the
church
because
i
have
ceased
to
believe
but
had
it
nothing
to
do
with
lady
sunderbund
he
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
if
it
means
breaking
with
that
woman
she
said
you
mean
he
said
beginning
for
the
first
time
to
comprehend
her
that
you
do
mind
the
poverty
poverty
she
cried
i
cared
for
nothing
but
the
disgrace
oh
never
mind
ted
if
it
is
true
if
i
been
dreaming
instead
of
a
woman
stunned
by
a
life
sentence
of
poverty
he
saw
his
wife
rejoicing
as
if
she
had
heard
good
news
their
minds
were
held
for
a
minute
by
the
sound
of
some
one
knocking
at
the
house
door
one
of
the
girls
opened
the
door
there
was
a
brief
hubbub
in
the
passage
and
then
they
heard
a
cry
of
eleanor
through
the
folding
doors
there
eleanor
he
said
realizing
he
had
told
his
wife
nothing
of
the
encounter
in
hyde
park
they
heard
eleanor
clear
voice
where
mummy
or
daddy
and
then
ca
stay
now
dears
where
mummy
or
daddy
i
ought
to
have
told
you
said
scrope
quickly
i
met
eleanor
in
the
park
by
accident
she
come
up
unexpectedly
to
meet
a
boy
going
to
the
front
quite
a
nice
boy
son
of
riverton
the
doctor
the
parting
had
made
them
understand
one
another
it
all
right
ella
it
a
little
irregular
but
i
stake
my
life
on
the
boy
she
very
eleanor
appeared
through
the
folding
doors
she
came
to
business
at
once
i
promised
you
i
come
back
to
supper
here
daddy
she
said
but
i
do
want
to
have
supper
here
i
want
to
stay
out
she
saw
her
mother
look
perplexed
has
daddy
told
you
but
where
is
young
riverton
he
eleanor
became
aware
of
a
broad
chink
in
the
folding
doors
that
was
making
the
an
auditorium
for
their
dialogue
she
shut
them
deftly
i
have
told
mummy
scrope
explained
bring
him
in
to
supper
we
ought
to
see
eleanor
hesitated
she
indicated
her
sisters
beyond
the
folding
doors
they
all
be
watching
us
mummy
she
said
we
be
uncomfortable
and
besides
but
you
ca
go
out
and
dine
with
him
alone
oh
mummy
it
our
only
customs
are
changing
said
scrope
but
can
they
asked
lady
ella
i
do
see
why
the
mother
was
still
doubtful
but
she
was
in
no
mood
to
cross
her
husband
that
night
it
an
exceptional
occasion
said
scrope
and
eleanor
knew
her
point
was
won
she
became
radiant
i
can
be
late
scrope
handed
her
his
without
a
word
you
dear
kind
things
she
said
and
went
to
the
door
then
turned
and
came
back
and
kissed
her
father
then
she
kissed
her
mother
it
is
so
kind
of
you
she
said
and
was
gone
they
listened
to
her
passage
through
a
storm
of
questions
in
the
three
months
ago
that
would
have
shocked
me
said
lady
ella
you
have
seen
the
boy
said
scrope
but
the
appearances
are
we
rather
breaking
with
appearances
he
said
and
he
goes
perhaps
to
get
killed
he
added
a
lad
like
a
schoolboy
a
young
thing
because
of
the
political
foolery
that
we
priests
and
teachers
have
suffered
in
the
place
of
the
kingdom
of
god
because
we
have
allowed
the
religion
of
europe
to
become
a
lie
because
no
man
spoke
the
word
of
god
you
see
when
i
see
that
see
those
two
those
children
of
wrenched
by
tragedy
beginning
with
a
parting
it
like
a
knife
slashing
at
all
our
appearances
and
discretions
think
of
our
lovemaking
the
front
door
banged
he
had
some
idea
of
resuming
their
talk
but
his
was
a
scattered
mind
now
it
a
quarter
to
eight
he
said
as
if
in
explanation
i
must
see
to
the
supper
said
lady
ella
there
was
an
air
of
tension
at
supper
as
though
the
whole
family
felt
that
momentous
words
impended
but
phoebe
had
emerged
victorious
from
her
mathematical
struggle
and
she
seemed
to
eat
with
better
appetite
than
she
had
shown
for
some
time
it
was
a
cold
meat
supper
lady
ella
had
found
it
impossible
to
keep
up
the
regular
practice
of
a
cooked
dinner
in
the
evening
and
now
it
was
only
on
thursdays
that
the
scropes
to
preserve
their
social
tradition
dressed
and
dined
the
rest
of
the
week
they
supped
lady
ella
never
talked
very
much
at
supper
this
evening
was
no
exception
clementina
talked
of
london
university
and
bedford
college
she
had
been
making
enquiries
daphne
described
some
of
the
mistresses
at
her
new
school
the
feeling
that
something
was
expected
had
got
upon
scrope
nerves
he
talked
a
little
in
a
flat
and
obvious
way
and
lapsed
into
thoughtful
silences
while
supper
was
being
cleared
away
he
went
back
into
his
study
thence
he
returned
to
the
hearthrug
as
his
family
resumed
their
various
occupations
he
tried
to
speak
in
a
casual
conversational
tone
i
want
to
tell
you
all
he
said
of
something
that
has
happened
he
waited
phoebe
had
begun
to
figure
at
a
fresh
sheet
of
computations
miriam
bent
her
head
closer
over
her
work
as
though
she
winced
at
what
was
coming
daphne
and
clementina
looked
at
one
another
their
eyes
said
eleanor
but
he
was
too
full
of
his
own
intention
to
read
that
glance
only
his
wife
regarded
him
attentively
it
concerns
you
all
he
said
he
looked
at
phoebe
he
saw
lady
ella
hand
go
out
and
touch
the
hand
gently
to
make
her
desist
phoebe
obeyed
with
a
little
sigh
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
refused
an
income
that
would
certainly
have
exceeded
fifteen
hundred
pounds
a
clementina
looked
up
now
this
was
not
what
she
expected
her
expression
conveyed
protesting
enquiry
i
want
you
all
to
understand
why
i
did
that
and
why
we
are
in
the
position
we
are
in
and
what
lies
before
us
i
want
you
to
know
what
has
been
going
on
in
my
he
looked
down
at
the
hearthrug
and
tried
to
throw
off
a
memory
of
his
princhester
classes
for
young
women
that
oppressed
him
his
manner
he
forced
to
a
more
familiar
note
he
stuck
his
hands
into
his
trouser
pockets
you
know
my
dears
i
had
to
give
up
the
church
i
just
simply
believe
any
more
in
orthodox
church
teaching
and
i
feel
i
never
explained
that
properly
to
you
not
at
all
clearly
i
want
to
explain
that
now
it
a
queer
thing
i
know
for
me
to
say
to
you
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
am
a
religious
man
i
believe
that
god
matters
more
than
wealth
or
comfort
or
position
or
the
respect
of
men
that
he
also
matters
more
than
your
comfort
and
prosperity
god
knows
i
have
cared
for
your
comfort
and
prosperity
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
in
all
these
changes
we
have
been
through
lately
i
have
been
aware
of
all
the
discomfort
into
which
you
have
come
the
relative
discomfort
compared
with
princhester
this
is
dark
and
crowded
and
i
have
never
felt
crowded
before
but
in
this
house
i
know
you
are
horribly
crowded
it
is
a
house
that
seems
almost
contrived
for
small
discomforts
this
narrow
passage
outside
the
incessant
going
up
and
down
stairs
and
there
are
other
things
there
is
the
blankness
of
our
london
sundays
what
is
the
good
of
pretending
they
are
desolating
there
the
impossibility
too
of
getting
good
servants
to
come
into
our
kitchen
i
not
blind
to
all
these
sordid
consequences
but
all
the
same
god
has
to
be
served
first
i
had
to
come
to
this
i
felt
i
could
not
serve
god
any
longer
as
a
bishop
in
the
established
church
because
i
did
not
believe
that
the
established
church
was
serving
god
i
struggled
against
that
conviction
and
i
struggled
against
it
largely
for
your
sakes
but
i
had
to
obey
my
conviction
i
have
talked
to
you
about
these
things
as
much
as
i
should
have
done
but
partly
at
least
that
is
due
to
the
fact
that
my
own
mind
has
been
changing
and
reconsidering
going
forward
and
going
back
and
in
that
fluid
state
it
did
seem
fair
to
tell
you
things
that
i
might
presently
find
mistaken
but
now
i
begin
to
feel
that
i
have
really
thought
out
things
and
that
they
are
definite
enough
to
tell
you
he
paused
and
resumed
a
number
of
things
have
helped
to
change
the
opinions
in
which
i
grew
up
and
in
which
you
have
grown
up
there
were
worries
at
princhester
i
did
let
you
know
much
about
them
but
there
were
there
was
something
harsh
and
cruel
in
that
atmosphere
i
saw
for
the
first
time
it
a
lesson
i
still
only
learning
how
harsh
and
greedy
rich
people
and
employing
people
are
to
poor
people
and
working
people
and
how
ineffective
our
church
was
to
make
things
better
that
struck
me
there
were
religious
disputes
in
the
diocese
too
and
they
shook
me
i
thought
my
faith
was
built
on
a
rock
and
i
found
it
was
built
on
sand
it
was
slipping
and
sliding
long
before
the
war
but
the
war
brought
it
down
before
the
war
such
a
lot
of
things
in
england
and
europe
seemed
like
a
comedy
or
a
farce
a
bad
joke
that
one
tolerated
one
tried
half
consciously
half
avoiding
the
knowledge
of
what
one
was
doing
to
keep
one
own
little
circle
and
life
civilized
the
war
shook
all
those
ideas
of
isolation
all
that
sort
of
evasion
down
the
world
is
the
rightful
kingdom
of
god
we
had
left
its
affairs
to
kings
and
emperors
and
suchlike
impostors
to
priests
and
and
greedy
men
we
were
genteel
condoners
the
war
has
ended
that
it
thrusts
into
all
our
lives
it
brings
death
so
close
a
fortnight
ago
people
were
killed
and
injured
within
a
mile
of
this
by
zeppelin
bombs
every
one
loses
some
one
because
through
all
that
time
men
like
myself
were
going
through
our
priestly
mummeries
abasing
ourselves
to
kings
and
politicians
when
we
ought
to
have
been
crying
out
no
there
is
no
righteousness
in
the
world
there
is
no
right
government
except
it
be
the
kingdom
of
god
he
paused
and
looked
at
them
they
were
all
listening
to
him
now
but
he
was
still
haunted
by
a
dread
of
preaching
in
his
own
family
he
dropped
to
the
conversational
note
again
you
see
what
i
had
in
mind
i
saw
i
must
come
out
of
this
and
preach
the
kingdom
of
god
that
was
my
idea
i
do
want
to
force
it
upon
you
but
i
want
you
to
understand
why
i
acted
as
i
did
but
let
me
come
to
the
particular
thing
that
has
happened
i
did
not
think
when
i
made
my
final
decision
to
leave
the
church
that
it
meant
such
poverty
as
this
we
are
living
in
permanently
that
is
what
i
want
to
make
clear
to
you
i
thought
there
would
be
a
temporary
dip
into
dinginess
but
that
was
all
there
was
a
plan
at
the
time
it
seemed
a
right
and
reasonable
plan
for
setting
up
a
chapel
in
london
a
very
plain
and
simple
undenominational
chapel
for
the
simple
preaching
of
the
world
kingdom
of
god
there
was
some
one
who
seemed
prepared
to
meet
all
the
immediate
demands
for
such
a
was
it
lady
sunderbund
asked
clementina
scrope
was
pulled
up
abruptly
yes
he
said
it
seemed
at
first
a
quite
hopeful
we
have
hated
that
said
clementina
with
a
glance
as
if
for
assent
at
her
mother
we
should
all
have
hated
anyhow
it
has
fallen
we
do
mind
that
said
clementina
and
daphne
echoed
her
words
i
do
see
that
there
is
any
necessity
to
import
this
note
of
hostility
to
lady
sunderbund
into
this
he
addressed
himself
rather
more
definitely
to
lady
ella
she
a
woman
of
a
very
extraordinary
character
highly
emotional
energetic
generous
to
an
extraordinary
extent
daphne
made
a
little
noise
like
a
comment
a
faint
acerbity
in
her
father
voice
responded
anyhow
you
make
a
mistake
if
you
think
that
the
personality
of
lady
sunderbund
has
very
much
to
do
with
this
thing
now
her
quality
may
have
brought
out
certain
aspects
of
the
situation
rather
more
sharply
than
they
might
have
been
brought
out
under
other
circumstances
but
if
this
chapel
enterprise
had
been
suggested
by
quite
a
different
sort
of
person
by
a
man
or
by
a
committee
in
the
end
i
think
i
should
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
leave
lady
sunderbund
out
any
chapel
was
impossible
it
is
just
this
specialization
that
has
been
the
trouble
with
religion
it
is
just
this
tendency
to
make
it
the
business
of
a
special
sort
of
man
in
a
special
sort
of
building
on
a
special
day
every
man
every
building
every
day
belongs
equally
to
god
that
is
my
conviction
i
think
that
the
only
possible
existing
sort
of
religions
meeting
is
something
after
the
fashion
of
the
quaker
meeting
in
that
there
is
no
professional
religious
man
at
all
not
a
trace
of
the
sacrifices
to
the
ancient
gods
and
no
room
for
a
professional
religions
man
he
felt
his
argument
did
a
little
escape
him
he
snatched
that
is
what
i
want
to
make
clear
to
you
god
is
not
a
speciality
he
is
a
universal
he
stopped
both
daphne
and
clementina
seemed
disposed
to
say
something
and
did
not
say
anything
miriam
was
the
first
to
speak
daddy
she
said
i
know
i
stupid
but
are
we
still
christians
i
want
you
to
think
for
but
i
mean
said
miriam
are
we
something
like
quakers
a
sort
of
very
broad
christians
you
are
what
you
choose
to
be
if
you
want
to
keep
in
the
church
then
you
must
keep
in
the
church
if
you
feel
that
the
christian
doctrine
is
alive
then
it
is
alive
so
far
as
you
are
but
the
creeds
asked
clementina
he
shook
his
head
so
far
as
christianity
is
defined
by
its
creeds
i
am
not
a
christian
if
we
are
going
to
call
any
sort
of
religious
feeling
that
has
a
respect
for
jesus
christianity
then
no
doubt
i
am
a
christian
but
so
was
mohammed
at
that
rate
let
me
tell
you
what
i
believe
i
believe
in
god
i
believe
in
the
immediate
presence
of
god
in
every
human
life
i
believe
that
our
lives
have
to
serve
the
kingdom
of
god
that
practically
is
what
chasters
calls
core
of
truth
in
christianity
you
have
been
reading
him
eleanor
lent
me
the
book
but
chasters
keeps
his
i
am
not
chasters
said
scrope
stiffly
and
then
relenting
what
he
does
may
be
right
for
him
but
i
could
not
do
as
he
lady
ella
had
said
no
word
for
some
time
i
would
be
ashamed
she
said
quietly
if
you
had
not
done
as
you
have
done
i
do
mind
the
girls
do
mind
all
this
not
when
we
understand
as
we
do
that
was
the
limit
of
her
eloquence
not
now
that
we
understand
daddy
said
clementina
and
a
faint
flavour
of
lady
sunderbund
seemed
to
pass
and
vanish
there
was
a
queer
little
pause
he
stood
rather
distressed
and
perplexed
because
the
talk
had
not
gone
quite
as
he
had
intended
it
to
go
it
had
deteriorated
towards
personal
issues
phoebe
broke
the
awkwardness
by
jumping
up
and
coming
to
her
father
dear
daddy
she
said
and
kissed
him
we
did
understand
properly
said
clementina
in
the
tone
of
one
who
explains
away
much
that
had
never
been
spoken
daddy
said
miriam
with
an
inspiration
may
i
play
something
to
you
presently
but
the
fire
interjected
lady
ella
disposing
of
that
idea
i
want
you
to
know
all
of
you
the
faith
i
have
he
said
daphne
had
remained
seated
at
the
table
are
we
never
to
go
to
church
again
she
asked
as
if
at
a
loss
scrope
went
back
into
his
little
study
he
felt
shy
and
awkward
with
his
daughters
now
he
felt
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
back
to
usualness
with
them
it
would
be
impossible
he
must
come
down
to
breakfast
as
though
their
talk
had
never
occurred
in
his
rehearsal
of
this
deliverance
during
his
walk
home
he
had
spoken
much
more
plainly
of
his
sense
of
the
coming
of
god
to
rule
the
world
and
end
the
long
age
of
the
warring
nations
and
competing
traders
and
he
had
intended
to
speak
with
equal
plainness
of
the
passionate
subordination
of
the
individual
life
to
this
great
common
purpose
of
god
and
man
an
aspect
he
had
scarcely
mentioned
at
all
but
in
that
little
room
in
the
presence
of
those
dear
familiar
people
those
great
horizons
of
life
had
vanished
the
room
with
its
folding
doors
had
fixed
the
scale
the
wallpaper
had
smothered
the
kingdom
of
god
he
had
been
he
felt
domestic
it
had
been
an
talk
he
had
been
put
out
too
by
the
mention
of
lady
sunderbund
and
the
case
of
chasters
in
his
study
he
consoled
himself
for
this
diminution
of
his
intention
it
had
taken
him
five
years
he
reflected
to
get
to
his
present
real
sense
of
god
presence
and
to
his
personal
subordination
to
purpose
it
had
been
a
little
absurd
he
perceived
to
expect
these
girls
to
leap
at
once
to
a
complete
understanding
of
the
halting
hints
the
allusive
indications
of
the
thoughts
that
now
possessed
his
soul
he
tried
like
some
maiden
speaker
to
recall
exactly
what
it
was
he
had
said
and
what
it
was
he
had
forgotten
to
say
this
was
merely
a
beginning
merely
a
beginning
after
the
girls
had
gone
to
bed
lady
ella
came
to
him
and
she
was
glowing
and
tender
she
was
in
love
again
as
she
had
not
been
since
the
shadow
had
first
fallen
between
them
i
was
so
glad
you
spoke
to
them
she
said
they
had
been
puzzled
but
they
are
dear
loyal
he
tried
to
tell
her
rather
more
plainly
what
he
felt
about
the
whole
question
of
religion
in
their
lives
but
eloquence
had
departed
from
him
you
see
ella
life
can
not
get
out
of
tragedy
and
sordid
tragedy
until
we
bring
about
the
kingdom
of
god
it
no
unreality
that
has
made
me
come
out
of
the
no
dear
no
she
said
soothingly
and
reassuringly
with
all
these
mere
boys
going
to
the
most
dreadful
deaths
in
the
trenches
with
death
hardship
and
separation
running
amok
in
the
world
one
has
to
do
something
she
agreed
i
know
dear
he
said
that
all
this
year
of
doubt
and
change
has
been
a
dreadful
year
for
it
was
stupid
of
me
she
said
but
i
have
been
so
unhappy
over
now
but
i
was
wretched
and
there
was
nothing
i
could
say
i
prayed
it
is
the
poverty
i
feared
ever
but
the
disgrace
now
i
happy
i
happy
again
but
how
far
do
you
come
with
me
i
with
but
he
said
you
are
still
a
churchwoman
i
do
know
she
said
i
do
he
stared
at
her
but
i
thought
always
that
was
what
hurt
you
most
my
breach
with
the
things
are
so
different
now
she
said
her
heart
dissolved
within
her
into
tender
possessiveness
there
came
flooding
into
her
mind
the
old
phrases
of
an
ancient
story
whither
thou
goest
i
will
go
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
the
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
aught
but
death
part
thee
and
just
those
words
would
lady
ella
have
said
to
her
husband
now
but
she
was
capable
of
no
such
rhetoric
whither
thou
goest
she
whispered
almost
inaudibly
and
she
could
get
no
further
my
dear
she
said
at
two
the
next
morning
scrope
was
still
up
he
was
sitting
over
the
snoring
gas
fire
in
his
study
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
bed
his
mind
was
too
excited
he
knew
for
any
hope
of
sleep
in
the
last
twelve
hours
since
he
had
gone
out
across
the
park
to
his
momentous
talk
with
lady
sunderbund
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
life
had
passed
through
its
cardinal
crisis
and
come
to
its
crown
and
decision
the
spiritual
voyage
that
had
begun
five
years
ago
amidst
a
stormy
succession
of
theological
nightmares
had
reached
harbour
at
last
he
was
established
now
in
the
sure
conviction
of
god
reality
and
of
his
advent
to
unify
the
lives
of
men
and
to
save
mankind
some
unobserved
process
in
his
mind
had
perfected
that
conviction
behind
the
cloudy
veil
of
his
vacillations
and
moods
surely
that
work
was
finished
now
and
the
day
experience
had
drawn
the
veil
and
discovered
god
established
for
ever
he
contrasted
this
simple
and
overruling
knowledge
of
god
as
the
supreme
fact
in
a
practical
world
with
that
vague
and
ineffective
subject
for
sentiment
who
had
been
the
god
of
his
anglican
days
some
theologian
once
spoke
of
god
as
the
friend
behind
phenomena
that
anglican
deity
had
been
rather
a
vague
flummery
behind
court
and
society
wealth
respectability
and
the
comfortable
life
and
even
while
he
had
lived
in
lipservice
to
that
complaisant
compromise
this
true
god
had
been
here
this
god
he
now
certainly
professed
waiting
for
his
allegiance
waiting
to
take
up
the
kingship
of
this
distraught
and
bloodstained
earth
the
finding
of
god
is
but
the
stripping
of
bandages
from
the
eyes
seek
and
ye
shall
find
he
whispered
four
words
very
softly
the
kingdom
of
god
he
was
quite
sure
he
had
that
now
quite
sure
the
kingdom
of
god
that
now
was
the
form
into
which
all
his
life
must
fall
he
recalled
his
vision
of
the
silver
sphere
and
of
ten
thousand
diverse
minds
about
the
world
all
making
their
ways
to
the
same
one
conclusion
here
at
last
was
a
king
and
emperor
for
mankind
for
whom
one
need
have
neither
contempt
nor
resentment
here
was
an
aim
for
which
man
might
forge
the
steel
and
wield
the
scalpel
write
and
paint
and
till
and
teach
upon
this
conception
he
must
model
all
his
life
upon
this
basis
he
must
found
friendships
and
all
the
great
religions
christianity
islam
in
the
days
of
their
power
and
honesty
had
proclaimed
the
advent
of
this
kingdom
of
god
it
had
been
their
common
inspiration
a
religion
surrenders
when
it
abandons
the
promise
of
its
millennium
he
had
recovered
that
ancient
and
immortal
hope
all
men
must
achieve
it
and
with
their
achievement
the
rule
of
god
begins
he
muttered
his
faith
it
made
it
more
definite
to
put
it
into
words
and
utter
it
it
comes
it
surely
comes
i
begin
i
will
do
no
work
that
goes
not
godward
always
now
it
shall
be
the
truth
as
near
as
i
can
put
it
always
now
it
shall
be
the
service
of
the
commonweal
as
well
as
i
can
do
it
i
will
live
for
the
ending
of
all
false
kingship
and
priestcraft
for
the
eternal
growth
of
the
spirit
of
man
he
was
he
knew
clearly
only
one
common
soldier
in
a
great
army
that
was
finding
its
way
to
enlistment
round
and
about
the
earth
he
was
not
alone
while
the
kings
of
this
world
fought
for
dominion
these
others
gathered
and
found
themselves
and
one
another
these
others
of
the
faith
that
grows
plain
these
men
who
have
resolved
to
end
the
bloodstained
chronicles
of
the
dynasts
and
the
miseries
of
a
world
that
trades
in
life
for
ever
they
were
many
men
speaking
divers
tongues
he
was
but
one
who
obeyed
the
worldwide
impulse
he
could
smile
at
the
artless
vanity
that
had
blinded
him
to
the
import
of
his
earlier
visions
that
had
made
him
imagine
himself
a
sole
discoverer
a
new
prophet
that
had
brought
him
so
near
to
founding
a
new
sect
every
soldier
in
the
new
host
was
a
recruiting
sergeant
according
to
his
opportunity
and
none
was
leader
only
god
was
leader
the
achievement
of
the
kingdom
of
god
this
was
his
calling
henceforth
this
was
his
business
in
life
for
a
time
he
indulged
in
vague
dreams
of
that
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
of
which
he
would
be
one
of
the
makers
it
was
a
dream
of
a
shadowy
splendour
of
cities
of
great
scientific
achievements
of
a
universal
beauty
of
beautiful
people
living
in
the
light
of
god
of
a
splendid
adventure
thrusting
out
at
last
among
the
stars
but
neither
his
natural
bent
nor
his
mental
training
inclined
him
to
mechanical
or
administrative
explicitness
much
more
was
his
dream
a
vision
of
men
inwardly
ennobled
and
united
in
spirit
he
saw
history
growing
reasonable
and
life
visibly
noble
as
mankind
realized
the
divine
aim
all
the
outward
peace
and
order
the
joy
of
physical
existence
finely
conceived
the
mounting
power
and
widening
aim
were
but
the
expression
and
verification
of
the
growth
of
god
within
then
we
would
bear
children
for
finer
ends
than
the
blood
and
mud
of
battlefields
life
would
tower
up
like
a
great
flame
by
faith
we
reached
forward
to
that
the
vision
grew
more
splendid
as
it
grew
more
metaphorical
and
the
price
one
paid
for
that
one
gave
sham
dignities
false
honour
a
levitical
righteousness
immediate
peace
one
bartered
kings
and
churches
for
god
he
looked
at
the
mean
room
he
marked
the
dinginess
and
tawdriness
of
its
detail
and
all
the
sordid
evidences
of
ungracious
bargaining
and
grudging
service
in
its
appointments
for
all
his
life
now
he
would
have
to
live
in
such
rooms
he
who
had
been
one
of
the
lucky
ones
well
men
were
living
in
and
dying
gaily
in
muddy
trenches
they
had
given
limbs
and
lives
eyes
and
the
joy
of
movement
prosperity
and
pride
for
a
smaller
cause
and
a
feebler
assurance
than
this
that
he
had
found
presently
his
thoughts
were
brought
back
to
his
family
by
the
sounds
of
eleanor
return
he
heard
her
key
in
the
outer
door
he
heard
her
move
about
in
the
hall
and
then
slip
lightly
up
to
bed
he
did
not
go
out
to
speak
to
her
and
she
did
not
note
the
light
under
his
door
he
would
talk
to
her
later
when
this
discovery
of
her
own
emotions
no
longer
dominated
her
mind
he
recalled
her
departing
figure
and
how
she
had
walked
touching
and
looking
up
to
her
young
mate
and
he
a
little
leaning
to
her
god
bless
them
and
save
them
he
said
he
thought
of
her
sisters
they
had
said
but
little
to
his
clumsy
explanations
he
thought
of
the
years
and
experience
that
they
must
needs
pass
through
before
they
could
think
the
fulness
of
his
present
thoughts
and
so
he
tempered
his
disappointment
they
were
a
gallant
group
he
felt
he
had
to
thank
ella
and
good
fortune
that
so
they
were
there
was
clementina
with
her
odd
quick
combatant
sharpness
a
harder
being
than
eleanor
but
nevertheless
a
and
even
more
independent
there
was
miriam
indefatigably
kind
phoebe
too
had
a
real
passion
of
the
intellect
and
daphne
an
innate
disposition
to
service
but
it
was
strange
how
they
had
taken
his
proclamation
of
a
conclusive
breach
with
the
church
as
though
it
was
a
command
they
must
at
least
outwardly
obey
he
had
expected
them
to
be
more
deeply
shocked
he
had
thought
he
would
have
to
argue
against
objections
and
convert
them
to
his
views
their
acquiescence
was
strange
they
were
content
he
should
think
all
this
great
issue
out
and
give
his
results
to
them
and
his
wife
well
as
he
knew
her
had
surprised
him
he
thought
of
her
words
whither
thou
goest
he
was
dissatisfied
with
this
unconditional
agreement
why
could
not
his
wife
meet
god
as
he
had
met
god
why
must
miriam
put
the
fantastic
question
as
though
it
was
not
for
her
to
decide
are
we
still
christians
and
pursuing
this
thought
why
could
lady
sunderbund
set
up
in
religion
for
herself
without
going
about
the
world
seeking
for
a
priest
and
prophet
were
women
undines
who
must
get
their
souls
from
mortal
men
and
who
was
it
tempted
men
to
set
themselves
up
as
priests
it
was
the
wife
the
disciple
the
lover
who
was
the
last
the
most
fatal
pitfall
on
the
way
to
god
he
began
to
pray
still
sitting
as
he
prayed
oh
god
he
prayed
thou
who
has
shown
thyself
to
me
let
me
never
forget
thee
again
save
me
from
forgetfulness
and
show
thyself
to
those
i
love
show
thyself
to
all
mankind
use
me
o
god
use
me
but
keep
my
soul
alive
save
me
from
the
presumption
of
the
trusted
servant
save
me
from
the
vanity
of
authority
and
let
thy
light
shine
upon
all
those
who
are
so
dear
to
me
save
them
from
me
take
their
dear
loyalty
he
paused
a
flushed
childishly
miserable
face
that
stared
indignantly
through
glittering
tears
rose
before
his
eyes
he
forgot
that
he
had
been
addressing
god
how
can
i
help
you
you
silly
thing
he
said
i
would
give
my
own
soul
to
know
that
god
had
given
his
peace
to
you
i
could
not
do
as
you
wished
and
i
have
hurt
you
you
hurt
yourself
but
all
the
time
you
would
have
hampered
me
and
tempted
me
and
wasted
yourself
it
was
impossible
and
yet
you
are
so
fine
he
was
struck
by
another
aspect
ella
was
happy
partly
because
lady
sunderbund
was
hurt
and
left
desolated
both
of
them
are
still
living
upon
nothings
living
for
nothings
a
phantom
way
of
living
he
stared
blankly
at
the
humming
blue
gas
jets
amidst
the
incandescent
asbestos
for
a
space
make
them
understand
he
pleaded
as
though
he
spoke
confidentially
of
some
desirable
and
reasonable
thing
to
a
friend
who
sat
beside
him
you
see
it
is
so
hard
for
them
until
they
understand
it
is
easy
enough
when
one
