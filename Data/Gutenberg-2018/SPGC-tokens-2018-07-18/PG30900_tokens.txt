preface
to
second
edition
the
most
eloquent
testimony
given
this
little
book
is
the
fact
that
a
second
edition
is
made
necessary
only
a
few
months
after
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
favorable
comments
and
letters
of
recommendation
from
men
and
women
eminent
in
literary
and
scientific
realms
and
commendatory
reviews
in
periodicals
of
high
standard
are
i
think
sufficient
cause
for
the
belief
that
the
tyranny
of
god
forms
a
necessary
cog
in
the
machinery
of
intellectual
thought
and
progress
even
those
who
bitterly
oppose
the
book
admit
that
it
possesses
the
power
to
make
its
readers
think
of
the
many
opposing
reviews
and
adverse
criticism
of
the
tyranny
of
god
not
a
single
one
offers
an
argument
in
answer
to
it
for
the
most
part
their
characterization
has
been
that
it
is
pessimistic
as
if
by
calling
it
pessimistic
they
refute
its
claims
if
to
tell
a
man
the
true
nature
of
a
disease
from
which
he
is
suffering
with
the
hope
that
he
will
seek
a
cure
for
his
malady
is
pessimism
then
i
am
a
pessimist
is
the
use
of
a
danger
signal
at
a
hazardous
crossing
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
disaster
pessimism
if
to
literally
hold
the
mirror
up
to
nature
disclosing
utter
disregard
for
the
life
and
feelings
of
man
as
a
warning
against
the
extravagant
and
useless
propagating
of
life
is
pessimism
then
surely
i
am
a
pessimist
if
a
fervent
desire
to
help
man
instead
of
wasting
time
in
prayer
to
god
is
pessimism
i
am
a
pessimist
if
to
think
to
investigate
to
express
one
thoughts
courageously
in
the
face
of
centuries
old
dogma
is
pessimism
then
i
must
confess
i
am
a
pessimist
if
to
expose
sham
hypocrisy
and
fraud
if
to
open
the
mind
and
free
it
from
fear
if
to
stimulate
the
intellect
and
work
for
the
here
instead
of
the
hereafter
if
all
these
are
classified
as
pessimism
then
truly
may
i
be
called
an
arch
pessimist
the
tyranny
of
god
was
written
to
express
the
truth
as
i
see
it
to
portray
life
not
as
we
would
like
to
have
it
but
as
it
actually
is
millions
are
still
like
frightened
children
afraid
of
their
own
shadows
fear
of
the
truth
is
the
greatest
deterrent
to
its
acceptance
joseph
lewis
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
i
am
indeed
gratified
to
send
forth
the
fourth
edition
of
the
tyranny
of
god
i
wish
however
to
say
to
the
reader
that
my
book
deals
with
life
philosophically
and
not
individually
it
was
from
the
viewpoint
of
life
in
general
and
the
universe
as
a
whole
that
the
sentiments
herein
were
expressed
to
love
god
is
not
the
duty
of
man
and
one
of
the
most
important
tasks
to
be
accomplished
for
the
human
race
is
to
destroy
the
theistic
conception
of
life
and
the
universe
the
sentiments
i
expressed
at
a
memorial
meeting
in
honor
of
luther
burbank
last
may
best
illustrate
my
convictions
i
said
the
religious
person
loves
god
so
vehemently
that
he
has
no
love
left
for
man
may
the
tyranny
of
god
do
much
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
its
author
joseph
lewis
introduction
did
we
come
from
what
are
we
doing
here
whither
are
we
going
these
questions
have
puzzled
thinking
people
since
consciousness
first
dawned
in
the
brain
many
have
sought
to
answer
them
so
why
not
i
with
the
hope
that
the
reading
of
this
book
will
arouse
in
the
minds
of
the
readers
thoughts
that
will
enable
them
to
answer
these
questions
for
themselves
were
you
suddenly
to
find
yourself
living
on
another
planet
and
you
were
a
thinking
being
one
anxious
for
knowledge
you
would
naturally
investigate
the
conditions
under
which
you
found
yourself
and
seek
if
possible
a
solution
for
your
existence
there
surely
it
is
equally
appropriate
situated
as
we
are
on
this
earth
endowed
with
brains
and
possessing
senses
and
nerves
to
inquire
into
and
investigate
the
conditions
under
which
we
live
and
the
purpose
if
any
of
our
existence
here
the
peculiarity
of
this
existence
warrants
such
analysis
it
is
certain
from
our
understanding
as
well
as
from
all
visible
scientific
facts
that
we
did
not
make
ourselves
and
that
we
never
had
a
former
existence
and
we
are
led
to
conclude
in
view
of
lack
of
credible
evidence
to
the
contrary
from
those
who
have
passed
on
that
the
future
so
far
as
our
individual
life
is
concerned
is
an
eternal
void
it
is
also
certain
as
science
has
indubitably
shown
that
we
do
not
make
our
offspring
that
we
are
not
creators
but
are
instruments
merely
in
producing
life
furthermore
we
did
not
make
any
portion
of
the
globe
which
we
inhabit
and
of
which
we
are
a
part
and
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
determine
all
the
natural
conditions
and
raw
materials
of
our
environment
are
something
separate
and
distinct
from
anything
which
we
ourselves
possess
sufficient
power
to
accomplish
therefore
since
among
the
organs
of
my
body
there
is
a
portion
i
am
within
the
bounds
of
sanity
when
i
investigate
and
express
such
thoughts
opinions
and
findings
as
my
reason
and
understanding
dictate
no
one
can
truthfully
say
that
he
possesses
sufficient
knowledge
to
account
for
or
to
explain
the
peculiar
and
mystifying
rules
conditions
and
surroundings
which
we
are
to
accept
abide
by
and
live
under
and
therefore
the
result
of
one
findings
is
worthy
the
same
consideration
as
those
of
another
upon
such
basis
i
submit
an
honest
attempt
to
express
logically
my
convictions
upon
this
vital
and
puzzling
condition
of
our
existence
and
shall
endeavor
to
aid
those
who
read
this
book
to
see
conditions
in
what
i
believe
to
be
their
true
light
and
to
stimulate
the
readers
to
think
for
themselves
it
is
only
through
the
exchange
of
the
results
of
investigations
and
of
honest
opinions
that
we
have
been
able
to
add
improvement
to
improvement
and
make
easier
the
routine
of
our
lives
the
conditions
and
elements
that
compose
nature
for
the
sake
of
clearness
i
will
ofttimes
call
god
i
shall
be
more
easily
understood
and
at
times
the
term
god
will
express
more
succinctly
the
thoughts
or
ideas
i
wish
to
express
the
tyranny
of
god
i
lest
i
be
misunderstood
i
will
say
at
the
outset
that
i
do
not
believe
in
a
god
the
belief
in
a
god
is
still
generally
accepted
not
because
of
the
existence
of
one
but
for
the
reason
that
it
is
the
easiest
way
to
account
for
our
condition
but
in
the
light
of
scientific
discoveries
and
demonstrations
such
a
belief
is
unfounded
and
utterly
untenable
yet
the
word
god
and
even
the
word
nature
must
often
be
used
to
describe
that
condition
which
the
brain
of
man
has
not
yet
been
able
to
analyze
fully
and
scientifically
one
ridiculous
conception
of
god
that
is
believed
by
a
multitude
of
people
is
that
of
a
massive
being
sitting
in
a
marble
chamber
studded
with
gold
and
lighted
with
glistening
crystals
do
those
who
believe
in
such
a
creature
ever
consider
him
taking
a
bath
and
in
what
or
of
eating
his
breakfast
and
of
what
it
consists
if
there
were
a
god
and
the
world
were
governed
with
stern
justice
tempered
to
our
feeble
intelligence
existence
might
become
tolerable
but
as
it
is
with
a
god
ruling
above
the
earth
is
an
abominable
place
and
life
a
long
series
of
terrifying
torments
if
i
were
to
advocate
a
belief
or
faith
in
a
god
i
would
seek
the
embodiment
of
those
things
diametrically
opposite
to
the
attributes
of
the
popular
god
of
such
a
creature
is
not
worthy
the
sacrifice
of
ourselves
and
our
thoughts
let
us
examine
and
investigate
the
system
and
arrangement
of
the
world
that
is
that
portion
of
which
we
are
a
part
and
which
so
vitally
concerns
us
the
result
of
our
most
extensive
study
and
labor
shows
us
that
the
earth
after
an
illimitable
duration
of
time
has
gradually
attained
its
present
peculiar
development
in
other
words
nature
has
taken
millions
of
years
to
produce
the
earth
as
it
is
now
formed
and
if
it
were
made
particularly
for
human
beings
it
is
not
yet
completed
for
we
still
find
spots
aye
vast
areas
where
human
life
is
incapable
of
subsisting
the
climate
is
either
too
hot
or
too
cold
there
is
too
much
water
or
too
little
moisture
the
means
of
cultivation
are
too
meager
or
utterly
unobtainable
in
short
after
eons
of
labor
nature
has
failed
to
be
able
to
present
to
every
one
of
us
for
our
habitation
a
parcel
of
earth
commodious
and
comfortable
enough
to
be
perfectly
desirable
for
life
and
its
living
surely
if
the
earth
were
made
for
our
benefit
nature
has
been
not
only
a
very
poor
provider
but
a
very
thoughtless
parent
some
say
that
man
is
nature
best
product
that
the
earth
was
made
for
us
that
we
are
particularly
selected
by
god
and
that
a
certain
race
is
his
chosen
people
but
that
is
not
true
the
jews
are
no
more
chosen
people
than
the
jay
is
his
chosen
bird
or
the
mosquito
his
chosen
insect
it
is
not
true
that
nature
particularly
works
for
us
facts
prove
the
contrary
facts
prove
that
we
are
nothing
but
an
undesirable
to
make
our
way
and
to
live
our
life
as
best
we
can
within
a
cruelly
turbulent
space
imprisoned
by
invisible
impenetrable
walls
of
limitation
no
it
is
not
true
that
our
life
is
favored
by
nature
after
we
build
our
homes
make
our
cities
and
add
improvements
what
happens
nature
with
her
forceful
winds
blows
them
down
her
cruel
storms
and
rising
floods
wash
them
away
as
so
much
refuse
and
a
tremor
of
the
earth
destroys
not
only
our
homes
but
ourselves
also
leaving
no
traces
of
our
efforts
treasures
and
sacred
ties
even
as
individuals
we
curse
god
for
the
shortcomings
with
which
we
are
afflicted
the
exceedingly
stout
person
one
who
is
in
his
own
way
curses
god
for
making
him
so
stout
the
thin
person
has
a
similar
grievance
those
who
are
too
large
and
those
who
are
too
small
are
equally
dissatisfied
the
shape
of
an
eye
the
curve
of
the
mouth
a
blemish
here
an
impediment
there
is
the
direct
cause
of
poignant
embarrassment
organs
or
dimensions
too
unsightly
and
unsatisfactory
are
productive
of
continual
worry
and
torment
throughout
our
lives
the
blind
the
deaf
the
dumb
and
the
crippled
have
forever
a
curse
for
god
upon
their
lips
we
inhabit
the
air
with
a
density
of
fifteen
pounds
to
the
square
inch
a
mixture
of
dirt
and
water
in
the
same
manner
that
the
fish
inhabits
the
water
and
the
worm
the
earth
were
we
beings
of
a
superior
type
nature
would
have
made
us
so
versatile
that
we
should
be
able
to
accustom
ourselves
to
any
condition
and
survive
in
any
climate
but
despite
all
our
improvements
despite
all
man
efforts
to
avoid
and
escape
the
conditions
of
nature
many
of
us
freeze
to
death
in
winter
and
become
prostrate
from
the
heat
of
summer
if
it
were
true
that
the
earth
were
purposely
made
and
existing
for
us
there
would
be
no
flowers
born
to
blush
unseen
and
waste
their
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
we
ourselves
scientists
tell
us
are
the
result
of
a
long
series
of
evolutionary
development
they
tell
us
that
nature
started
with
a
single
cell
of
protoplasm
a
single
cell
of
living
organism
and
produced
the
present
human
species
after
the
life
and
death
of
an
illimitable
number
of
forms
through
the
stages
of
countless
ages
not
exempting
those
lives
from
the
fear
torture
and
misery
that
are
still
so
essential
a
part
of
the
scheme
of
life
why
impose
so
cruel
and
wasteful
a
condition
upon
those
numberless
billions
that
have
lived
before
us
since
nothing
but
eternal
death
was
gained
by
their
existence
surely
nature
is
a
poor
architect
and
builder
after
taking
so
much
material
and
so
much
time
to
make
such
an
incomplete
place
for
such
an
outlandish
form
to
rule
and
occupy
if
we
were
given
the
same
opportunity
that
is
you
and
i
with
all
the
power
and
resources
of
nature
to
build
a
habitable
place
and
mold
a
living
something
to
inhabit
it
our
results
would
be
ten
thousand
times
better
than
that
which
circles
the
scope
and
boundary
of
our
lives
with
the
incomprehensible
physical
form
with
which
we
breathe
and
manifest
life
truthfully
and
without
the
slightest
element
of
egotism
i
should
be
ashamed
of
my
efforts
were
i
to
present
as
my
handiwork
nothing
better
than
the
level
and
plane
which
nature
has
attained
ii
we
come
into
this
world
a
tiny
bundle
and
mass
of
helpless
feeble
flesh
utterly
unprepared
to
meet
the
requirements
and
fearful
conditions
that
lie
in
wait
for
us
we
are
in
need
of
immediate
urgent
and
constant
help
from
those
who
were
responsible
for
our
birth
imperatively
so
from
our
mother
the
child
does
not
ask
to
come
and
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
its
welfare
and
the
mother
often
does
not
want
to
bear
it
as
she
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
maternal
cares
and
yet
that
mother
must
go
through
the
shadow
of
the
valley
of
death
before
she
can
deliver
this
tiny
bundle
and
helpless
mass
of
feeble
flesh
and
how
often
aye
only
too
often
does
the
mother
the
valley
of
death
when
making
delivery
of
this
living
form
never
to
see
the
face
of
the
child
that
nature
imposed
upon
her
to
bear
what
a
despicable
arrangement
what
an
unfair
bargain
can
you
imagine
a
more
outlandish
ridiculous
awkward
complicated
cruel
and
fearful
system
of
reproduction
than
that
which
we
are
under
yoke
to
pursue
without
the
elaborate
details
of
the
perilous
stages
of
life
development
this
is
the
method
of
incubation
nature
imposes
upon
us
before
the
birth
of
a
human
being
one
male
and
one
female
that
is
one
man
and
one
woman
must
have
sexual
intercourse
whether
this
intercourse
is
prompted
by
all
the
finer
impulses
of
life
or
is
accomplished
by
the
savageness
of
rape
makes
no
difference
to
purpose
to
nature
the
end
justifies
the
means
and
she
continues
to
go
about
her
business
the
male
that
is
the
man
of
this
pair
can
strut
and
parade
with
the
utmost
freedom
from
his
responsibility
for
the
result
of
his
act
that
nature
has
made
to
be
among
his
desires
but
the
female
that
is
the
woman
of
this
pair
for
nine
just
think
of
it
carry
and
develop
the
germ
of
this
child
in
the
fertile
field
of
her
womb
and
be
subjected
to
the
innumerable
terrifying
dangers
accompanying
such
a
carriage
and
then
suffer
a
superhuman
torture
to
make
the
delivery
through
a
very
meager
channel
of
her
body
of
this
living
plant
which
she
has
never
seen
does
not
know
and
quite
often
does
not
want
must
absolutely
provided
nature
has
not
made
the
creature
too
deformed
and
mutilated
and
unable
to
survive
the
mother
must
during
a
period
of
constant
care
and
bear
this
feeble
infant
for
another
period
of
nine
months
or
more
suckling
at
her
breast
for
so
you
see
that
woman
is
not
only
a
human
being
but
a
fertile
ground
and
pasture
i
have
not
gone
into
the
misery
of
child
bearing
and
caring
nor
of
the
ingratitude
that
is
so
often
received
i
ask
for
what
reason
has
nature
imposed
this
terrible
penalty
upon
woman
would
you
reader
were
it
in
your
power
formulate
such
a
method
of
reproduction
i
answer
for
you
no
but
that
is
not
all
for
years
to
come
this
child
that
for
nine
months
was
carried
inwardly
and
for
a
much
longer
period
outwardly
by
its
mother
must
now
be
fed
washed
and
clothed
for
an
indefinite
number
of
and
guided
through
a
thousand
perils
and
dangers
that
nature
has
set
before
it
with
disease
as
nature
agent
crouching
and
ready
to
destroy
the
child
life
not
in
open
combat
but
invisibly
concealed
by
the
limitation
of
our
senses
this
is
one
of
nature
unspeakable
crimes
one
of
god
despicable
impositions
it
is
not
sufficient
that
a
mother
should
subject
herself
to
such
a
dangerous
and
perilous
mission
but
she
must
also
withstand
the
cruel
savageness
the
cold
callous
death
piercings
of
nature
invisible
tyrants
and
destroyers
life
holds
but
one
real
attraction
one
instance
that
can
be
classified
above
all
others
without
this
attraction
it
would
be
a
blessing
to
choke
the
life
breath
from
us
all
with
it
we
are
helped
to
bear
the
of
there
comes
a
time
to
some
of
us
when
the
heart
of
the
one
man
beats
for
the
one
woman
and
there
alights
and
resides
in
their
breasts
that
spark
of
devotion
that
we
call
love
when
there
is
born
to
that
union
a
child
even
though
in
nature
stupid
way
then
a
bond
is
created
more
precious
than
anything
else
in
this
world
without
this
little
circle
of
loving
joy
the
earth
is
a
prison
and
life
a
grave
injustice
for
those
who
must
bear
it
but
think
of
the
damnable
rule
of
nature
that
strives
and
delights
in
working
destruction
of
the
only
condition
worthy
of
life
living
oh
if
only
the
life
of
our
offspring
were
more
stable
more
secure
if
only
the
bosom
of
our
family
were
guaranteed
to
us
just
think
the
child
the
parents
would
not
harm
nature
tortures
and
god
kills
looking
back
upon
the
path
we
have
trodden
with
its
continual
fight
against
disease
its
manifold
combats
with
obstacles
of
life
and
with
its
inevitable
portion
of
sorrow
we
all
must
bear
we
should
think
seriously
and
consider
the
result
of
our
act
before
we
deliberately
bring
another
human
being
into
this
life
you
yourself
do
not
consider
your
life
worthy
of
reliving
so
why
bring
a
human
being
here
to
go
through
the
same
if
not
more
suffering
and
misery
than
you
have
borne
with
no
resultant
good
iii
up
to
this
point
i
have
been
speaking
of
human
beings
only
living
under
improved
conditions
that
man
has
made
what
must
be
the
horror
darkness
and
emptiness
of
those
living
substances
that
are
inferior
to
us
do
you
know
and
realize
the
suffering
that
we
endure
then
let
me
in
passing
urge
this
be
also
kind
and
considerate
to
our
less
fortunate
inhabitants
of
this
earth
the
dumb
animals
their
feelings
are
quite
similar
to
ours
they
have
gone
through
the
rougher
parts
of
evolution
that
gave
to
us
our
more
useful
organs
and
limbs
they
are
allied
to
us
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
members
of
our
own
species
they
have
their
painful
aches
and
periods
their
hardships
and
tortures
their
broken
family
ties
and
fearful
abhorrence
of
death
their
flesh
is
tender
and
their
skin
is
as
delicate
to
them
as
ours
is
to
us
so
let
us
think
twice
dear
readers
before
we
deliberately
harm
any
of
our
humbler
brothers
and
sisters
that
must
inhabit
this
cold
and
callous
earth
and
live
their
lives
under
a
great
deal
more
tyranny
and
injustice
than
we
live
ours
we
deliberately
enslave
and
brutally
treat
the
gentle
horse
we
tyrannically
imprison
birds
and
fishes
as
pets
we
keep
breed
kill
and
eat
a
variety
of
animals
for
our
own
selfish
purposes
and
yet
some
persons
still
have
the
audacity
to
say
that
we
are
chosen
people
god
children
divine
beings
bah
you
know
what
painful
inconvenience
there
is
in
losing
an
arm
or
a
leg
well
the
winged
and
footed
beings
that
must
bear
this
life
suffer
a
great
deal
more
than
we
do
when
one
of
their
limbs
becomes
dismembered
man
has
to
a
degree
remedied
or
replaced
his
crippled
limbs
but
i
do
not
think
any
other
of
the
higher
animals
have
advanced
so
far
and
as
a
result
these
creatures
must
endure
their
pain
and
distressing
annoyance
to
the
end
recently
i
watched
a
common
house
fly
caught
upon
fly
paper
and
studied
intently
every
visible
movement
of
it
immediately
upon
alighting
upon
the
sticky
substance
its
first
thought
almost
instantaneously
was
to
make
an
effort
to
free
itself
at
once
i
thought
of
the
fly
instinct
of
and
contrasted
it
with
the
human
the
fly
must
have
had
intelligence
since
it
knew
that
its
life
was
in
danger
and
since
nature
does
not
deal
in
fly
paper
the
reasoning
power
told
it
of
its
peril
with
unabated
determination
it
vibrated
its
wings
with
rapidity
and
worked
its
legs
unceasingly
them
in
the
in
its
efforts
to
pull
itself
away
to
freedom
as
i
watched
this
fly
in
its
labor
this
thought
came
to
me
is
the
fly
unlike
the
human
being
in
its
desire
to
live
is
it
afraid
of
death
and
of
the
mystery
of
dissolution
has
it
too
all
the
agony
of
fear
of
passing
to
the
great
beyond
has
it
too
an
imaginary
god
in
the
form
of
a
big
fly
and
is
it
also
afraid
of
that
god
supposed
wrath
if
the
fly
desire
to
live
is
so
great
what
interest
does
it
have
in
life
does
it
love
does
it
derive
happiness
when
it
is
able
to
labor
to
make
happy
its
fly
juliet
does
it
want
to
live
because
it
is
ambitious
and
is
trying
to
excel
other
flies
does
it
really
think
to
better
its
species
and
solve
the
problem
of
its
kind
is
there
a
fly
family
to
mourn
its
death
while
watching
that
fly
and
asking
myself
these
questions
i
was
convinced
of
the
following
that
the
force
that
we
call
life
is
the
same
that
animates
the
fly
that
it
too
has
control
of
its
muscles
and
nerves
in
the
same
proportion
as
we
have
control
of
ours
that
it
too
possesses
the
five
senses
and
adds
to
its
tiny
brain
more
intelligence
through
its
experiences
within
the
movements
and
actions
of
that
fly
was
wrapped
up
the
secret
of
whence
did
i
come
and
whither
am
i
going
as
i
released
my
attention
from
that
fly
i
muttered
to
myself
the
more
i
look
at
insects
the
more
i
think
i
am
one
for
what
purpose
do
arise
in
the
morning
fill
our
stomachs
with
food
till
the
fields
and
perform
labor
in
exchange
for
nourishment
in
the
evening
fall
into
a
sleep
from
exertion
arise
the
next
day
and
perform
the
same
routine
day
in
and
day
out
week
in
and
week
out
year
in
and
year
out
and
at
the
age
and
in
the
heyday
of
physical
development
seek
an
outlet
in
the
opposite
sex
for
the
strongest
impulse
that
nature
has
implanted
in
us
this
impulse
forces
us
to
commit
rape
and
murder
robbery
and
assault
and
to
violate
every
principle
of
honor
that
man
has
tried
to
establish
for
the
betterment
and
advancement
of
the
race
with
the
dissipation
of
this
mighty
sex
force
we
subside
and
decline
into
weakness
and
decay
only
to
pass
into
death
and
oblivion
what
a
fearful
wasted
effort
is
this
life
iv
the
system
of
nourishment
that
nature
has
imposed
upon
the
world
is
not
only
stupid
and
malicious
but
also
of
a
cannibalistic
character
we
as
frail
human
beings
are
horrified
and
shocked
to
think
that
our
ancestors
trafficked
in
and
delighted
in
eating
the
flesh
of
their
race
and
even
we
are
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
discourage
the
barbarous
custom
of
killing
animals
to
eat
their
flesh
yet
it
seems
a
dictate
of
nature
that
forces
us
to
uphold
that
custom
just
think
of
it
nourishment
and
forces
are
derived
from
eating
the
cooked
flesh
of
a
dead
animal
the
unborn
fowl
the
bowels
of
the
lamb
and
the
eggs
of
the
fish
can
you
imagine
the
wildness
of
life
in
such
a
jungle
of
cannibalism
no
wonder
the
savage
instinct
is
so
deeply
implanted
in
us
to
get
a
fair
idea
of
the
food
we
eat
to
sustain
life
and
to
please
and
satisfy
our
palates
we
need
but
take
a
casual
glance
at
any
of
our
modern
butcher
shops
although
you
will
not
see
human
limbs
on
display
and
for
sale
as
they
were
years
ago
you
will
be
impressed
with
the
following
morsels
put
there
to
tempt
your
appetite
in
our
modern
butcher
shops
you
will
find
pigs
feet
calves
brains
ox
tongues
breasts
and
legs
of
lamb
chicken
livers
dogs
ground
to
bits
and
sold
as
sausages
live
and
dead
fish
of
all
kinds
and
varieties
and
innumerable
other
portions
of
animal
flesh
fortunately
we
have
got
beyond
the
point
where
we
eat
the
entrails
of
these
animals
although
we
use
their
hoofs
to
make
glue
their
bones
for
powder
and
we
string
our
delicate
musical
instruments
with
their
vitals
the
things
we
consume
in
turn
consume
the
living
forms
that
they
capture
and
subdue
the
lion
the
tiger
and
the
leopard
will
devour
us
more
quickly
and
with
less
ceremony
and
with
more
delight
than
we
devour
other
animals
we
being
civilized
boil
the
animal
flesh
and
season
it
with
weeds
that
nature
allows
to
grow
to
give
it
zest
and
flavor
while
our
wilder
brothers
eat
us
in
the
raw
natural
manner
only
removing
our
civilized
clothes
really
if
getting
nearer
to
god
is
getting
back
to
nature
the
beasts
of
the
fields
have
an
advantage
over
us
and
we
know
that
even
the
living
things
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
suffer
alike
from
the
fearful
tortures
and
penalties
of
the
world
they
follow
almost
the
identical
routine
of
life
that
we
follow
birth
life
reproduction
and
death
are
their
lot
as
well
as
ours
so
that
if
man
were
only
to
practice
the
idealism
of
his
cramped
and
feeble
brain
he
would
starve
to
death
v
if
the
world
is
the
result
of
an
established
plan
as
some
say
it
must
be
the
conception
of
a
hideous
monster
whose
three
cardinal
principles
are
disease
despair
and
death
but
this
much
we
can
say
though
god
created
us
a
savage
fortunately
man
is
civilizing
nature
brute
and
is
making
him
a
man
disease
is
one
of
nature
cardinal
forces
so
to
attain
health
we
struggle
against
disease
but
health
only
means
the
guarding
of
it
through
fear
with
all
the
ills
the
flesh
is
heir
to
true
health
is
a
chimera
an
existing
state
unknown
to
man
to
be
well
is
such
a
precious
condition
that
nature
cautions
us
against
expecting
to
retain
health
too
long
by
instructing
us
through
experience
to
prepare
for
a
siege
of
illness
thus
disease
and
illness
would
seem
to
be
the
natural
states
and
health
the
artificial
condition
under
which
nature
permits
us
to
live
no
one
goes
to
his
grave
without
suffering
the
tortures
of
some
disease
and
paying
the
penalty
of
living
no
one
is
exempt
from
the
inflictions
nature
imposes
the
greater
portion
of
our
life
consists
in
devising
means
and
medication
to
relieve
us
of
our
states
of
ill
health
and
disease
sanitation
and
all
the
methods
we
are
capable
of
discovering
and
inventing
are
becoming
universally
applied
to
kill
and
to
destroy
the
menacing
germs
that
god
causes
to
inhabit
the
air
and
that
breed
and
multiply
in
the
fertile
flesh
of
our
bodies
and
finally
we
are
so
utterly
ignorant
of
how
even
to
eat
sleep
walk
breathe
stand
or
sit
that
the
slightest
infringement
of
the
simplest
rules
of
life
can
and
does
cause
us
irreparable
harm
if
we
did
not
move
to
help
ourselves
nature
would
have
us
live
in
filth
and
stagnation
we
seek
discover
or
invent
all
kinds
of
methods
to
build
health
and
to
remain
perfectly
strong
throughout
our
lives
and
yet
despite
it
all
we
are
puny
and
sickly
beings
in
fact
i
do
not
think
there
is
such
a
thing
as
perfect
health
what
we
may
do
to
correct
insure
or
perfect
our
healthy
tissues
will
have
a
detrimental
effect
upon
some
other
part
of
our
body
what
we
do
to
build
up
must
also
tear
down
what
we
do
to
produce
health
will
after
a
certain
point
produce
disease
this
it
seems
is
the
law
not
only
of
life
but
also
of
the
universe
it
is
regrettable
that
god
did
not
possess
the
magnanimity
of
an
ingersoll
and
make
health
contagious
instead
of
disease
physical
pain
and
mental
suffering
are
the
mysterious
sorrows
that
we
must
experience
and
pay
to
a
tyrant
god
for
the
existence
we
bear
it
is
incontrovertible
that
no
realization
is
given
us
by
nature
of
the
fearful
pains
and
tortures
that
we
are
capable
of
suffering
and
still
sustain
ourselves
only
to
repeat
over
and
over
again
the
unending
torment
in
exchange
for
the
consciousness
of
a
worthless
life
we
with
our
limited
intellects
with
our
puny
strength
with
our
inability
to
utilize
all
the
materials
in
our
possession
are
still
superior
to
the
workmanship
and
the
justice
of
god
tyrant
is
no
name
for
such
a
god
who
creates
a
living
organism
purposely
and
maliciously
to
torment
and
torture
it
a
poor
creature
is
a
god
who
makes
his
suffering
playthings
more
powerful
than
he
and
compels
them
to
bear
their
existence
under
the
lash
of
inexorable
laws
of
sorrow
and
suffering
pain
and
penalty
and
yet
we
are
satisfied
with
so
little
we
ask
for
a
crumb
only
we
are
pleased
with
the
slightest
favor
a
toy
delights
us
a
little
trinket
elicits
from
us
warm
gratitude
a
breath
of
balmy
air
is
drunken
with
keen
and
pleasurable
delight
a
fine
day
is
celebrated
with
exultation
but
what
a
mockery
is
life
we
writhe
in
pain
and
bear
the
brunt
of
an
arrogant
tyranny
from
whatever
force
that
created
and
controls
us
we
must
daily
bathe
our
bodies
wash
our
hair
brush
our
teeth
change
our
clothes
and
perform
other
necessary
physical
functions
to
feel
freedom
from
the
filthy
conditions
that
nature
imposes
upon
us
and
surrounds
us
with
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
eyes
she
should
have
given
us
perfect
ones
not
those
which
upon
the
slightest
contact
with
a
minute
foreign
substance
cause
unutterable
pain
and
possible
loss
of
sight
in
a
world
where
sight
is
so
imperative
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
ears
she
should
have
given
us
perfect
ones
not
those
which
are
capable
of
such
frightful
pain
with
the
possibility
of
becoming
totally
deaf
when
it
is
so
necessary
to
hear
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
a
nose
she
should
have
given
us
a
perfect
one
not
one
that
causes
such
miserable
torture
and
unbearable
suffering
from
the
slightest
defect
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
a
mouth
she
should
have
given
us
a
perfect
one
one
that
would
perform
all
the
functions
of
perfect
speech
not
one
that
is
so
liable
to
harm
and
so
susceptible
to
dumbness
when
speech
is
of
such
paramount
importance
to
life
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
teeth
she
should
have
given
us
perfect
ones
not
those
which
ache
and
pain
with
such
fearful
intensity
that
the
mind
is
almost
distracted
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
arms
legs
and
organs
she
should
have
given
us
perfect
ones
not
a
body
whose
tenderness
makes
it
an
instrument
of
such
menacing
torture
not
a
body
of
crippled
bones
and
crippled
joints
where
suffering
results
from
everything
it
does
if
nature
saw
fit
to
give
us
a
brain
she
should
have
given
us
one
strong
enough
to
withstand
all
the
rebuffs
of
life
and
one
capable
enough
to
utilize
all
the
forces
under
command
each
person
should
be
a
mental
hercules
capable
of
solving
his
own
problems
and
directing
all
matter
to
its
greatest
material
uses
instead
of
the
human
body
being
the
marvelously
constructed
instrument
we
are
wont
to
believe
it
we
now
find
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
common
machine
imperfectly
made
and
subject
to
innumerable
changes
and
radical
improvements
every
person
acquainted
with
the
anatomy
of
the
body
can
give
you
a
list
of
imperative
improvements
that
it
needs
and
without
which
it
will
continue
to
function
imperfectly
and
continue
to
cause
pain
and
suffering
to
its
possessor
it
were
a
great
deal
better
after
a
full
summary
of
life
were
we
to
be
created
utterly
devoid
of
feeling
equally
impervious
to
joy
and
sorrow
pleasure
and
pain
we
should
be
manifestly
benefited
for
the
greater
part
of
our
life
is
now
full
of
sorrow
anxiety
fear
pain
disappointment
and
worry
a
small
portion
of
our
life
is
a
matter
of
indifference
a
portion
might
be
termed
satisfaction
and
a
minute
balance
an
infinitesimal
part
termed
if
there
is
such
a
thing
in
life
joy
and
yet
the
joy
we
may
experience
will
not
be
present
to
cheer
and
comfort
us
but
the
pain
that
we
feel
will
pinch
us
more
strongly
and
will
remain
as
an
memory
joy
and
pleasure
are
of
a
transitory
nature
only
while
pain
and
sorrow
are
of
a
permanent
and
accumulative
character
is
of
life
worth
the
sorrow
the
agony
and
fear
of
death
just
think
of
giving
a
life
so
full
of
grief
that
those
who
have
it
do
not
want
it
and
quite
often
destroy
it
no
wonder
that
drugs
more
powerful
than
our
minds
used
to
numb
the
pains
of
life
are
so
much
in
demand
and
so
universally
used
what
a
ridiculous
assumption
it
is
to
think
that
a
soul
separate
and
distinct
from
the
body
would
imprison
itself
in
such
a
miserable
confinement
instead
of
life
being
a
privilege
it
is
a
prison
wherein
we
must
suffer
fearful
pains
and
still
more
fearful
thoughts
physical
pain
registers
a
high
degree
of
intense
feverish
suffering
but
mental
torture
is
fired
with
the
scorch
of
hell
vi
human
life
is
the
cheapest
thing
that
god
makes
no
consideration
is
given
to
the
feelings
pains
and
sorrows
it
must
bear
and
endure
no
wonder
that
ridicule
shame
hatred
and
other
forms
of
mental
suffering
can
not
be
withstood
by
some
frail
minds
and
cause
them
to
seek
relief
from
their
torment
under
the
brand
of
mental
torture
the
jealous
husband
sees
his
wife
violate
every
rule
and
principle
and
vow
of
virtue
he
sees
her
reveling
in
the
arms
and
embrace
of
him
that
he
despises
committing
trespass
upon
the
one
he
so
loves
the
husband
suffers
more
mentally
in
a
few
moments
of
these
imaginings
than
the
actual
performance
with
his
full
knowledge
could
cause
him
to
suffer
losses
mistakes
discouragements
and
disappointments
scorch
with
burning
blisters
the
lining
of
our
lives
i
once
thought
it
was
cowardly
to
make
destruction
of
oneself
but
i
must
say
that
more
mature
thought
supported
by
actual
scenes
and
experiences
has
caused
me
to
alter
my
view
but
before
i
go
farther
let
me
make
my
thought
clear
so
as
to
avoid
any
misunderstanding
i
do
not
mean
that
a
person
should
shirk
his
or
her
duty
in
the
face
of
hardship
discouragement
or
rebuke
on
the
contrary
the
mettle
of
the
man
is
best
tested
by
such
adverse
forces
and
some
of
the
most
inspiring
moments
of
life
lie
in
overcoming
these
conditions
and
triumphing
over
unjust
undue
and
seemingly
impossible
odds
what
i
do
mean
is
when
life
no
longer
holds
any
attraction
when
the
ravages
of
disease
have
torn
and
mutilated
your
body
when
pain
and
torture
are
raking
your
mind
and
your
daily
companions
are
these
miseries
with
no
possible
hope
of
their
relief
or
change
then
by
all
means
by
whatever
agency
you
desire
to
accomplish
it
save
yourself
the
terrible
agony
of
living
and
defeat
one
of
the
tyrant
impositions
of
god
vii
the
child
suffers
the
sharpest
pains
the
crudest
poignancy
that
could
possibly
be
inflicted
upon
its
body
through
the
stupid
frightening
and
monstrous
tales
that
are
continually
told
to
it
to
make
it
good
to
make
it
obey
to
think
that
a
child
can
not
bear
to
enter
the
dark
can
not
bear
to
be
alone
can
not
bear
to
be
separated
from
its
loving
and
protecting
parents
and
yet
must
suffer
in
a
few
moments
from
a
fatal
disease
the
agony
of
all
this
in
the
face
of
death
is
the
crime
of
crimes
too
damnable
and
horrible
for
words
i
remember
once
seeing
a
little
lost
child
it
cried
for
its
mother
hot
tears
were
streaming
down
its
burning
cheeks
its
face
portrayed
the
severest
form
of
suffering
that
life
is
capable
of
experiencing
if
nature
ever
made
a
frail
article
it
is
our
tender
offspring
so
bewildered
so
utterly
helpless
so
agonizingly
delusioned
so
pitifully
searching
for
some
familiar
face
something
to
make
it
discover
its
lost
self
oh
what
power
ever
made
us
so
tender
so
incapable
of
as
to
have
us
undergo
and
feel
such
terrific
suffering
it
is
injustice
enough
when
adults
are
made
to
suffer
mental
and
physical
ills
without
inflicting
such
a
painful
decree
upon
mere
infants
at
least
an
adult
has
some
conception
of
his
suffering
he
can
make
provision
for
some
remedy
he
can
seek
others
to
ask
them
to
render
help
he
knows
he
feels
he
understands
the
situation
and
can
adjust
himself
as
best
he
can
to
obtain
some
relief
but
not
so
with
the
child
its
mind
is
not
capable
of
comprehending
the
condition
which
makes
its
suffering
so
sharp
its
little
brain
is
too
feeble
hardly
strong
enough
to
direct
its
awkward
and
bulky
body
much
less
to
solve
such
an
incredible
predicament
as
being
utterly
destitute
of
help
in
a
world
fashioned
upon
such
an
unsatisfactory
plan
there
is
not
nor
can
there
be
a
sadder
more
distressing
sight
than
to
see
a
little
lost
child
overcome
with
fright
if
it
were
in
my
power
to
abolish
any
of
nature
cruel
laws
i
would
take
from
the
little
child
its
feeling
of
pain
let
me
ask
would
man
were
it
in
his
power
send
a
helpless
creature
utterly
unable
to
sustain
itself
without
power
of
thought
understanding
or
expression
so
dependent
upon
loving
care
kindness
help
and
comprehension
into
a
world
that
is
a
wilderness
a
world
reeking
with
pestilence
and
populated
with
shrieking
beasts
and
brutal
and
savage
people
as
a
passing
word
regarding
the
child
let
me
say
this
do
not
judge
your
child
as
an
ordinary
mechanical
instrument
as
if
he
could
be
wound
up
to
a
certain
degree
and
gradually
as
if
by
clockwork
tick
away
each
moment
of
the
day
the
child
is
a
combustible
force
and
although
there
are
certain
rules
by
which
you
may
obtain
the
greatest
degree
of
improvement
you
can
not
rigidly
adhere
to
them
there
are
numberless
instances
when
the
propensity
or
inclination
of
the
child
may
appear
to
you
to
be
aggravating
and
annoying
nevertheless
you
must
not
let
irritability
interfere
with
the
development
of
that
trait
preëminent
to
the
child
character
look
upon
your
child
encourage
your
boy
or
girl
to
be
a
pioneer
and
a
soldier
in
the
march
of
progress
instruct
it
with
the
knowledge
of
the
miserable
conditions
of
our
past
history
and
bring
it
forcibly
to
understand
that
efforts
only
are
repaid
and
that
we
must
work
in
order
to
accomplish
prayers
are
only
wasted
words
on
the
desert
air
the
greatest
mental
crime
ever
committed
is
that
of
teaching
a
child
while
still
upon
its
mother
knee
its
duty
and
obedience
to
god
it
would
appear
that
for
the
amount
of
suffering
it
must
endure
and
in
the
face
of
its
unconsulted
coming
we
should
at
least
disregard
god
for
his
insolence
and
impress
upon
the
child
the
peculiar
conditions
of
life
we
should
instruct
it
that
from
time
immemorial
nature
has
been
laboring
through
the
most
awkward
process
of
reproduction
and
has
finally
brought
the
child
into
existence
not
to
enjoy
the
benefits
or
eat
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
but
to
bear
a
life
of
continual
strife
and
suffering
not
of
god
should
we
speak
to
our
child
but
of
the
importance
of
being
prepared
to
do
all
in
its
power
to
help
others
to
escape
the
torture
misery
and
hardships
it
must
so
painfully
overcome
is
it
any
wonder
that
we
grow
up
to
be
serfs
and
slaves
before
we
are
able
to
know
or
understand
the
very
rudest
fundamentals
of
life
our
entire
mental
machinery
is
corrupted
by
unshakable
fears
and
dedicated
to
the
vilest
and
most
sickening
submission
would
that
we
were
left
alone
and
free
to
follow
the
thoughts
of
our
own
minds
regarding
the
great
problems
of
life
what
a
mighty
unhampered
power
we
would
possess
to
find
the
proper
course
of
action
and
possibly
the
real
solution
to
the
mystery
of
the
of
to
love
and
to
reverence
our
tormentor
is
repulsive
and
despicable
and
since
we
refuse
to
allow
man
to
tyrannize
over
man
what
degradation
it
is
for
the
human
race
to
cringe
and
bow
down
unconditionally
to
the
imagination
in
the
great
realm
of
uncertainty
do
not
hurt
your
child
do
not
strike
it
do
not
cause
it
any
unnecessary
pain
before
it
is
able
to
walk
before
it
is
able
to
talk
before
it
is
old
enough
to
tell
of
its
pain
and
suffering
nature
makes
it
endure
enough
remember
the
only
language
of
the
babe
is
the
cry
of
pain
imagine
yourself
under
the
lash
of
suffering
utterly
speechless
and
incapable
of
conveying
your
wants
and
feelings
to
an
absolutely
strange
surrounding
and
you
will
have
a
slight
picture
of
the
growing
child
in
your
household
did
you
ever
stop
to
consider
that
the
child
when
born
does
not
know
that
you
are
its
parent
it
does
not
know
that
you
are
its
father
or
that
you
are
its
mother
it
does
not
know
what
prompted
its
birth
or
why
it
must
live
and
above
all
what
it
has
done
to
be
sent
to
such
a
miserable
prison
place
as
the
planet
upon
which
we
live
we
must
demonstrate
all
this
as
well
as
we
can
to
the
child
this
much
we
can
be
sure
of
kindness
tenderness
and
love
should
forever
be
our
guide
in
our
dealings
and
contact
with
children
the
child
is
brought
into
this
world
from
the
insuppressible
passion
of
two
people
and
surely
without
its
consent
and
it
is
absolute
tyranny
and
barbarity
to
torment
its
mind
or
to
punish
its
body
regardless
of
the
result
its
action
may
have
upon
us
to
the
little
children
that
have
suffered
the
horrible
punishment
so
generally
followed
in
that
cruel
and
false
book
the
bible
my
heart
goes
out
in
pity
since
words
fail
me
to
describe
those
savage
characters
that
visit
inhuman
tormenting
and
torturous
treatment
upon
their
unwelcome
offspring
if
we
were
forced
to
perform
the
thousand
tyrannies
that
are
directed
against
the
child
during
the
day
by
cruel
and
thoughtless
parents
the
lunatic
asylum
would
soon
be
our
place
of
refuge
such
trivial
things
as
a
spot
on
the
shoe
a
speck
of
dirt
upon
the
clothes
a
mere
tip
of
the
hat
a
slight
turn
of
the
scarf
often
give
rise
to
such
violent
reprimand
and
very
often
brutal
punishment
that
the
savageness
of
barbarians
is
mild
compared
to
such
displays
of
temper
my
heart
again
goes
out
to
you
little
children
when
and
wherever
you
are
that
must
bear
the
brunt
of
brutal
actions
from
stupid
and
thoughtless
parents
and
guardians
these
people
seem
to
classify
children
in
the
matter
of
discipline
as
grown
ups
thinking
or
rather
not
thinking
that
children
undeveloped
minds
should
be
as
strong
as
theirs
when
they
themselves
are
unable
to
practice
the
that
they
expect
from
mere
infants
how
often
does
a
child
receive
a
slap
in
the
face
from
a
parent
for
the
asking
of
only
a
simple
question
when
the
parent
is
not
in
the
humor
to
bother
with
him
what
a
painful
and
terrifying
beating
does
a
child
often
get
for
disobeying
some
arbitrary
command
uttered
by
the
one
over
him
to
the
child
do
do
this
do
go
there
stand
up
straight
and
say
this
are
commands
that
carry
with
them
court
martial
and
its
severe
and
unrelenting
punishment
remember
this
the
child
will
respond
to
kindness
and
love
more
readily
and
directly
than
to
force
and
unwarranted
discipline
it
is
purely
a
question
of
whether
your
feelings
are
actuated
by
these
impulses
if
you
have
become
mentally
strong
enough
to
restrain
your
impulses
to
strike
your
child
do
not
substitute
other
means
to
punish
him
changing
the
method
of
brutally
inflicting
physical
pain
upon
your
child
to
some
other
means
though
less
repulsive
is
still
obnoxious
and
harmful
if
you
are
unable
to
convince
your
child
by
persuasion
example
or
otherwise
that
you
are
right
and
that
the
child
should
follow
your
instruction
then
by
all
means
let
it
become
the
victor
in
the
contest
fear
fear
of
pain
fear
in
every
form
controls
our
lives
and
shapes
the
courses
of
our
puny
destinies
viii
the
mind
through
fear
of
death
is
capable
of
suffering
within
a
few
moments
the
tortures
of
an
eternity
although
to
accomplish
death
nature
may
require
only
a
few
minutes
the
extent
of
the
capability
for
suffering
is
beyond
compare
nature
has
been
distinctly
conspicuous
in
imbuing
us
not
only
with
grave
doubts
and
uncertainties
but
also
with
an
unshakable
fear
regarding
death
in
the
deepest
moments
of
despair
when
living
has
absolutely
no
attraction
and
life
becomes
a
burden
and
a
menace
we
fight
desperately
and
without
abatement
for
this
narrow
worthless
thread
of
existence
possibly
the
fear
that
we
have
in
the
face
of
death
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
we
must
suffer
pain
before
death
is
accomplished
and
a
great
deal
of
the
theory
of
is
due
merely
to
our
great
horror
of
pain
the
indisputable
fact
that
thousands
take
their
lives
by
choosing
the
least
possible
painful
method
demonstrates
with
a
firm
conviction
my
thought
that
it
is
the
avoidance
of
pain
rather
than
the
retaining
of
life
that
prompts
our
efforts
to
live
it
is
only
too
true
and
heard
from
the
lips
of
thousands
that
if
they
could
only
lie
down
and
never
awake
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
we
speak
in
terms
of
having
lived
too
long
being
tired
of
living
life
not
worth
living
as
if
life
were
a
prison
sentence
and
often
rather
than
continue
the
servitude
we
surmount
and
overcome
the
deterrent
of
pain
and
destroy
the
life
very
often
our
desire
to
keep
on
living
is
prompted
by
our
baser
impulses
we
live
sometimes
to
get
even
with
someone
to
spite
someone
we
live
sometimes
to
be
able
to
show
what
we
can
or
can
not
do
were
it
not
for
these
baser
impulses
what
an
unlimited
number
of
people
would
refuse
to
continue
this
monotonous
painful
and
life
the
foregoing
expressions
of
life
at
one
time
or
another
represent
the
feelings
of
all
humanity
in
the
united
states
alone
during
the
year
it
has
been
conservatively
estimated
that
more
than
twelve
thousand
persons
committed
suicide
these
persons
were
engaged
in
all
kinds
of
pursuits
and
came
from
all
walks
of
life
they
ranged
from
social
outcasts
to
society
leaders
from
poverty
stricken
unfortunates
to
persons
of
great
wealth
from
illiterate
men
and
women
to
editors
and
college
professors
from
laborers
and
layman
to
physicians
and
ministers
the
youngest
suicide
was
a
mere
infant
of
five
years
the
oldest
a
centenarian
of
among
the
suicides
of
last
year
were
two
evangelists
and
twelve
clergymen
it
would
appear
that
those
who
had
devoted
their
thoughts
and
services
to
god
would
at
least
be
spared
the
agony
of
such
suffering
as
to
force
them
to
prefer
death
and
to
take
their
lives
i
say
with
ingersoll
it
is
a
wonder
god
does
not
at
least
protect
his
friends
and
defenders
the
reluctance
we
have
to
die
is
due
in
a
large
degree
to
the
possibility
of
securing
a
few
more
moments
of
joy
from
an
already
too
much
troubled
world
with
the
hope
that
a
little
compensation
will
be
derived
from
the
pain
and
sorrow
we
have
endured
and
yet
those
things
that
we
may
live
to
enjoy
and
may
likewise
be
present
to
thrill
us
at
some
future
date
away
and
beyond
the
limitation
we
are
capable
of
surviving
it
is
from
this
desire
that
we
unconsciously
feel
that
we
would
like
to
live
always
to
get
our
full
measure
of
return
and
since
such
is
neither
the
lot
nor
the
privilege
of
our
possession
it
really
makes
no
difference
when
we
die
as
far
as
personal
satisfaction
is
concerned
the
fear
that
possesses
us
now
in
the
matter
of
death
will
likewise
and
with
equal
force
possess
us
later
when
we
actually
and
without
ceremony
must
submit
to
the
inevitable
the
desire
that
possesses
a
person
to
live
now
will
with
equal
attraction
obsess
him
later
our
desires
and
aspirations
are
never
satisfied
what
we
may
cherish
to
accomplish
may
be
consummated
and
achieved
yet
another
something
will
demand
our
energies
to
be
spent
for
further
desires
to
be
accomplished
when
we
are
babies
we
desire
to
walk
when
we
walk
we
desire
to
talk
when
we
talk
we
desire
to
grow
after
we
grow
we
want
to
learn
after
we
learn
we
want
to
do
and
to
expand
and
our
performance
and
expansion
are
only
curtailed
by
insolent
death
ix
the
only
justification
there
is
to
live
once
conscious
of
the
damnable
scheme
of
life
is
the
burning
desire
to
do
something
to
help
mankind
bear
the
conditions
and
to
make
easier
the
burden
of
life
for
those
who
are
here
and
for
those
who
are
to
come
for
very
often
the
greatest
benefactors
of
the
race
are
so
maligned
and
persecuted
in
their
day
that
only
the
future
can
render
a
just
appreciation
of
their
labor
and
their
value
for
without
the
improvement
bestowed
on
life
by
the
world
benefactors
over
the
crudity
of
nature
it
were
better
that
we
remain
in
the
bosom
of
our
wilder
brothers
and
hang
from
the
trees
by
the
length
and
the
strength
of
our
tails
aye
back
and
back
and
back
down
every
degree
of
life
until
the
time
before
the
first
cell
of
protoplasm
from
an
inanimate
into
an
animate
state
started
why
must
we
be
made
to
suffer
such
dreadful
torment
before
death
since
by
eternal
decree
it
is
the
common
lot
all
must
endure
death
puzzling
eternal
death
is
nature
final
stamp
upon
our
fearful
struggle
through
life
and
the
agony
of
death
is
more
poignantly
mental
than
physical
since
the
mind
reviewing
the
acts
of
the
past
anticipates
with
anxiety
and
with
picturesque
vividness
the
wrongs
scandals
terrors
fears
and
injustice
of
the
future
since
life
is
so
replete
with
physical
pains
no
wonder
our
picture
of
death
is
so
horrible
we
see
upon
the
lifeless
form
the
cast
of
its
agonizing
pain
and
augur
from
that
an
eternity
of
sorrow
but
fortunately
in
reality
we
can
only
feel
pain
as
long
as
we
possess
life
in
a
sense
therefore
death
is
a
blessing
after
all
the
severest
pains
of
death
lie
in
the
brains
of
the
living
the
mind
is
capable
of
suffering
in
one
moment
all
that
a
lifetime
can
repay
with
pleasure
and
no
joy
is
sufficient
in
value
to
compensate
you
for
enduring
an
irreparable
loss
the
conditions
that
existed
before
our
birth
are
identical
with
the
conditions
that
will
exist
at
our
death
as
we
knew
no
life
and
felt
no
pain
before
our
birth
we
shall
know
no
life
and
feel
no
pain
after
our
death
death
is
no
longer
the
enigma
of
life
living
is
its
problem
the
sting
of
death
has
been
removed
we
know
death
destiny
and
no
longer
fear
its
consequences
the
only
suffering
attached
to
death
now
is
the
injustice
of
its
time
of
coming
the
reluctance
of
parting
with
loved
ones
and
the
loss
of
the
opportunity
to
attain
well
might
i
say
with
shakespeare
that
cowards
die
many
times
before
their
death
the
valiant
never
taste
of
death
but
once
of
all
the
wonders
that
i
yet
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
most
strange
that
men
should
fear
seeing
that
death
a
necessary
end
will
come
when
it
will
come
the
most
despicable
characters
of
human
life
are
those
who
prey
upon
credulous
persons
when
in
the
face
of
death
and
shrouded
with
the
fear
of
its
uncertainty
picturing
to
those
persons
horrible
and
frightening
tales
of
an
eternity
of
torture
what
unspeakable
misery
must
those
whose
religious
conviction
has
so
terrified
death
and
its
aftermath
especially
when
it
is
intensified
and
horrified
through
the
mouthpiece
of
ignorant
priests
suffer
in
consequence
of
death
oh
what
a
fearful
sting
must
be
there
just
think
what
this
poor
vast
credulous
multitude
pay
with
the
sweat
of
their
brows
and
the
bend
of
their
backs
to
enrich
these
moral
beasts
in
exchange
for
their
ignorant
and
terrifying
mumblings
that
rob
the
deluded
ones
of
every
fiber
of
courage
and
every
thought
of
perfect
peace
and
rest
it
is
while
living
that
death
possesses
its
sting
and
anguish
anyone
that
seeks
tribute
from
the
dying
or
from
the
living
for
services
on
behalf
of
the
dead
is
a
damnable
moral
scoundrel
and
a
cunning
rascal
to
those
whose
minds
have
been
poisoned
from
childhood
with
this
religious
conviction
this
most
awful
of
beliefs
i
cry
throw
off
these
tyrants
of
the
mind
emancipate
yourselves
from
this
fearful
ignorance
and
mental
bondage
what
a
burden
will
be
lifted
from
their
lives
and
what
a
glorious
freedom
they
will
experience
if
we
are
to
die
let
us
die
in
perfect
calmness
and
in
perfect
peace
let
us
become
firmly
convinced
that
once
we
are
dead
no
thought
no
act
can
possibly
harm
us
we
are
beyond
the
pale
of
nature
pangs
we
the
individuals
that
we
were
are
free
from
everything
we
are
at
rest
and
forever
x
but
after
this
life
with
all
our
pains
and
sorrows
what
then
what
is
there
to
repay
us
for
living
i
answer
i
have
no
misgivings
about
the
future
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
there
is
no
after
life
that
when
we
breathe
our
last
we
arrive
at
our
eternity
we
are
one
with
yesterday
seven
thousand
years
we
are
like
the
flower
which
once
blown
forever
dies
i
firmly
believe
that
life
as
now
manifested
in
our
bodies
is
a
combustible
force
identical
with
that
of
any
other
form
of
life
no
less
so
than
the
seed
of
the
flower
is
different
from
the
germ
of
the
wheat
both
are
forces
so
are
we
they
may
be
different
manifestations
but
fundamentally
they
are
the
same
in
fact
the
very
force
that
manifests
itself
in
a
mechanical
instrument
made
by
man
is
the
identical
substance
that
rules
the
organs
and
charges
the
brain
of
our
being
in
the
same
manner
that
the
force
dissipates
itself
in
the
mechanical
instrument
made
by
man
and
no
longer
gives
motion
to
its
parts
so
the
force
that
animates
our
being
dissipates
itself
and
is
no
longer
capable
of
giving
motion
to
our
parts
and
organs
as
man
instruments
are
dependent
upon
many
channels
for
their
complete
performance
so
the
human
brain
and
body
have
their
many
dependencies
that
must
fully
and
properly
be
nourished
to
maintain
their
power
each
day
science
draws
another
veil
from
the
mystery
of
life
our
eye
is
but
a
chemical
camera
that
we
have
not
only
reproduced
but
even
improved
upon
our
voice
is
nothing
but
a
vibration
that
we
have
not
only
reproduced
and
improved
upon
but
whose
minutest
modulations
we
have
recorded
in
innumerable
duplications
our
ear
is
but
a
drum
that
carries
and
conveys
to
the
brain
the
vibrations
of
our
voice
and
that
function
we
have
reproduced
and
even
improved
upon
by
the
instrument
we
call
the
telephone
the
telegraphic
system
of
the
human
body
that
communicates
to
the
brain
the
conditions
that
the
senses
perceive
is
no
other
than
that
which
man
has
even
improved
upon
by
the
transmission
of
an
intelligible
message
to
a
land
without
the
use
of
any
apparent
conductor
with
the
marvelous
instrument
the
telephone
man
sends
his
voice
around
the
world
man
greatest
inventions
the
phonograph
the
camera
and
the
telephone
both
wire
and
wireless
make
the
work
of
nature
as
manifested
in
our
bodies
a
simple
childish
affair
fit
only
for
the
kindergarten
of
things
when
edison
invented
the
incandescent
light
and
reproduced
the
human
voice
in
the
phonograph
he
pulled
aside
the
veil
of
secrecy
and
penetrated
the
infinite
proved
and
demonstrated
man
to
be
greater
than
our
limbs
carry
our
bodies
in
the
direction
our
brains
dictate
and
function
we
have
reproduced
and
even
improved
upon
in
all
the
means
of
locomotion
that
we
daily
use
and
which
we
now
consider
as
a
matter
of
fact
among
the
ordinary
things
of
life
comparisons
are
odious
when
we
compare
the
awkward
motion
of
nature
with
the
rapid
locomotion
of
man
man
progresses
far
too
rapidly
for
the
accommodation
of
nature
and
as
a
result
adapts
for
his
use
and
benefit
vital
essentials
that
nature
in
her
laziness
has
either
failed
to
utilize
or
will
not
utilize
although
we
have
not
yet
completely
discovered
all
the
material
and
mechanical
elements
that
compose
life
we
are
sure
and
certain
of
their
origin
we
hear
ourselves
talk
we
decide
upon
our
destination
and
direct
our
motion
we
eat
when
we
are
hungry
sleep
when
we
are
tired
cry
when
we
are
in
pain
and
laugh
when
we
are
tickled
our
whole
being
from
start
to
finish
is
mechanical
and
the
element
of
something
spiritual
something
separate
and
distinct
from
a
purely
material
sense
is
absolutely
illogical
and
in
view
of
the
illimitable
illustrations
that
are
being
demonstrated
every
day
it
is
a
thing
easily
understood
if
we
logically
and
intelligently
without
blindness
preference
or
prejudice
analyze
the
problem
it
may
sound
better
and
more
desirable
to
say
that
we
possess
a
soul
that
this
life
is
but
a
stepping
stone
to
a
higher
plane
but
it
is
not
true
we
can
not
observe
the
true
actual
facts
of
life
by
coloring
our
subject
if
we
want
to
determine
the
we
must
be
mentally
prepared
to
accept
the
a
painted
face
brightened
eyes
blackened
eyelids
marcelled
hair
and
a
form
draped
in
all
the
splendor
of
the
finest
silks
do
not
make
a
woman
possess
the
sweetness
and
charm
that
all
this
dope
is
intended
to
make
us
believe
as
much
as
man
wants
to
have
the
end
of
this
life
attain
certain
benefits
and
destinations
this
desire
does
not
make
them
real
the
implicit
confidence
in
a
faithless
wife
does
not
make
her
loyal
and
virtuous
a
wife
confidence
in
a
profligate
husband
does
not
make
him
stanch
and
true
life
calls
for
a
cold
analysis
it
must
be
stripped
of
all
its
artificial
colorings
and
superfluities
it
must
be
measured
and
weighed
for
what
it
actually
is
not
for
what
we
would
like
it
to
be
it
must
be
determined
in
the
unwavering
scales
of
science
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
not
the
man
in
the
white
starched
collar
with
trimmed
hair
shaven
face
and
polished
shoes
but
the
man
recently
from
the
forest
with
coarse
grizzly
hair
upon
his
back
brutal
and
violent
passion
dominating
his
body
and
savageness
and
hatred
in
his
startled
and
terrifying
eyes
the
sooner
we
come
to
the
realization
of
this
vital
fact
the
sooner
we
become
acquainted
with
the
basic
origin
of
life
the
sooner
we
shall
understand
life
with
its
achievements
with
its
aspirations
and
hopes
xi
it
is
an
absolute
fact
and
certainty
impossible
of
refutation
that
when
animation
ceases
in
the
body
and
no
effort
is
made
to
revive
it
life
ceases
and
the
processes
of
decay
and
decomposition
set
in
yet
it
is
permanently
established
and
has
been
successfully
demonstrated
innumerable
times
that
certain
methods
of
artificial
stimulation
have
revivified
and
resuscitated
the
delicate
organs
that
cause
the
heartbeat
and
give
consciousness
to
the
brain
recently
my
local
newspaper
contained
the
following
item
dead
but
saw
no
spirits
city
february
neal
dillingham
believe
in
communication
with
the
living
dillingham
was
dead
for
twenty
minutes
recently
and
he
says
he
ought
to
know
doctors
said
dillingham
blood
circulation
was
stopped
by
a
clot
of
blood
his
heart
stopped
beating
and
he
did
not
breathe
insertion
of
a
saline
solution
into
his
artery
just
above
the
heart
caused
the
clot
to
dissolve
and
dillingham
came
back
to
life
i
did
not
return
to
earth
after
i
left
it
said
dillingham
i
had
no
knowledge
of
anything
that
took
place
but
i
must
have
been
pretty
dead
as
i
do
know
i
did
recognize
several
persons
i
had
known
all
my
life
after
i
was
myself
again
if
i
had
any
talks
with
anybody
while
i
was
i
do
remember
anything
about
them
believing
that
the
publicity
that
this
case
received
would
make
the
party
known
to
the
postal
authorities
i
sat
down
and
wrote
him
a
letter
hoping
that
if
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
letter
delivered
to
him
he
might
be
kind
enough
to
write
me
personally
of
his
experience
after
a
lapse
of
several
days
i
received
from
him
a
letter
substantiating
in
detail
all
that
was
mentioned
in
the
newspaper
clipping
quoted
above
in
the
instance
of
this
man
dillingham
he
was
dead
so
to
speak
and
as
far
as
his
soul
was
concerned
it
had
left
the
body
yet
the
injection
of
a
material
solution
compounded
by
man
in
conjunction
with
artificial
respiration
caused
the
beating
of
the
heart
and
gave
back
to
the
brain
its
power
of
consciousness
if
it
is
the
soul
that
causes
the
functioning
of
the
body
where
is
it
when
such
an
action
takes
place
if
it
is
the
soul
that
gives
us
life
how
is
it
that
we
can
materially
and
mechanically
destroy
it
we
are
born
and
nourished
by
material
means
we
live
our
life
by
material
means
we
reproduce
our
kind
by
material
means
and
we
can
destroy
ourselves
by
material
means
everything
that
touches
and
concerns
our
life
is
purely
material
and
it
should
be
incumbent
upon
those
who
believe
in
the
soul
or
the
spiritual
element
of
man
to
produce
the
proof
of
their
contention
we
are
nothing
but
a
continual
propagating
instrument
without
spiritual
moral
lasting
or
ultimate
value
we
are
here
to
reproduce
our
kind
and
for
nothing
more
what
man
secures
for
himself
within
the
narrow
circle
of
his
existence
here
is
all
that
he
gains
for
the
life
that
nature
forces
him
to
live
everything
man
has
man
has
made
nothing
has
been
given
to
him
by
nature
god
has
been
a
miser
if
man
possessed
a
soul
the
thousand
deformities
of
the
brain
would
not
exist
insanity
would
be
impossible
and
all
the
forms
of
petty
vices
that
so
miserably
afflict
us
would
be
totally
unknown
that
which
gives
us
the
power
of
life
is
a
combination
of
the
material
forces
of
nature
and
the
elements
that
compose
the
brain
are
of
a
chemical
substance
the
difference
between
a
live
person
and
a
dead
one
can
be
summarized
by
a
great
many
instances
about
us
and
because
of
their
commonplaceness
we
do
not
observe
them
there
are
many
apples
falling
to
the
ground
but
we
are
not
inspired
with
the
knowledge
that
the
actuating
force
is
gravity
one
of
the
best
illustrations
to
show
the
difference
between
a
live
and
a
dead
person
can
be
had
from
that
excellent
invention
called
the
film
or
plate
and
which
is
so
remarkably
used
in
the
camera
when
that
sensitive
composition
of
chemicals
that
forms
the
film
and
which
produces
such
a
vivid
and
lasting
likeness
of
ourselves
is
freshly
made
it
possesses
that
vital
something
we
call
life
but
allow
this
film
to
remain
unused
for
a
period
of
time
and
it
will
no
longer
be
able
to
perform
its
remarkable
work
it
will
not
possess
the
life
to
take
a
picture
or
to
record
an
impression
if
a
premature
exposure
of
the
film
is
made
it
loses
its
vital
quality
because
of
the
mixture
with
other
elements
or
because
of
the
evaporation
of
its
constituent
parts
it
is
not
necessary
to
analyze
all
the
properties
of
that
film
to
show
the
principle
whereby
it
performs
its
wonderful
work
the
general
principle
showing
its
marvelous
use
while
intact
and
its
utter
uselessness
when
its
composition
is
no
longer
the
same
should
be
sufficient
to
illustrate
the
comparison
this
illustration
can
with
force
and
conviction
be
applied
to
the
peculiar
quality
and
nature
of
our
soul
and
brain
as
long
as
the
brain
is
incased
within
our
skull
and
fully
protected
from
contact
with
any
other
substance
to
alter
or
to
change
its
integrity
it
will
perform
all
that
is
warranted
of
it
in
the
case
of
our
brain
though
besides
the
importance
of
keeping
it
protected
from
outside
chemical
action
the
vital
element
concerned
in
its
continuity
of
life
lies
in
the
importance
of
keeping
it
constantly
nourished
and
supplied
with
the
remarkable
qualities
of
the
vital
substance
of
blood
the
moment
the
blood
supply
to
the
brain
is
stopped
our
brain
loses
its
most
important
constituent
with
the
ultimate
and
inevitable
result
of
inertia
decomposition
and
decay
when
this
condition
happens
we
are
then
dead
and
like
the
proverbial
egg
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
can
not
put
humpty
dumpty
together
again
if
we
possessed
a
soul
and
it
were
of
a
permanent
and
special
quality
it
would
maintain
its
impressions
and
remember
its
existence
it
could
pass
through
innumerable
periods
and
know
its
many
and
varied
journeys
even
memory
so
unreliable
in
our
short
life
bespeaks
the
utter
impossibility
of
such
a
thing
as
a
soul
with
a
permanent
and
lasting
existence
that
which
we
call
the
soul
is
nothing
but
a
chemical
composition
that
can
and
lose
its
permanency
while
we
are
still
alive
we
are
acquainted
with
a
number
of
chemical
compositions
that
must
remain
in
a
pacific
state
to
maintain
their
identity
so
those
chemical
forces
that
compose
our
soul
must
perforce
maintain
their
equilibrium
if
we
are
stunned
or
suffer
any
of
the
many
conditions
that
upset
chemical
compounds
and
compositions
we
for
the
time
being
suffer
either
unconsciousness
or
some
other
form
of
mental
disability
if
we
are
shocked
too
severely
we
become
totally
and
permanently
impaired
and
suffer
violent
fits
and
fearful
rages
insanity
or
imbecility
different
shocks
and
even
forms
of
disease
result
in
certain
action
upon
our
chemical
brain
which
causes
it
to
lose
only
part
of
its
ability
extreme
high
fever
is
only
one
form
of
illness
which
causes
the
brain
to
lose
its
stability
and
run
rampant
and
unbridled
if
i
were
fully
cognizant
of
all
forms
and
degrees
of
disease
i
could
recite
exactly
how
they
act
and
in
what
degree
they
harm
the
delicate
organism
of
our
brain
in
many
instances
shocks
or
diseases
too
powerful
for
our
brain
to
withstand
cause
that
portion
of
our
brain
that
may
control
our
speech
our
sight
our
hearing
our
limbs
or
other
organs
to
lose
its
power
with
the
consequence
that
we
must
suffer
and
be
handicapped
with
what
is
properly
called
a
great
affliction
science
has
discovered
that
great
truth
and
has
not
only
catalogued
the
different
portions
of
the
brain
in
their
individual
departments
or
capacities
but
by
a
master
stroke
of
surgery
can
correct
and
remedy
those
impaired
parts
and
give
back
to
the
human
being
the
use
of
those
valuable
organs
that
the
invisible
agents
of
nature
had
taken
away
so
instead
of
the
brain
possessing
a
soul
we
find
it
only
in
a
more
delicate
degree
a
mechanical
formation
such
as
we
discovered
our
body
to
be
but
if
we
possess
a
soul
and
it
is
capable
of
passing
through
the
many
and
varied
stages
that
life
suffers
what
becomes
of
its
impressions
what
and
where
are
the
benefits
of
its
retention
where
is
the
soul
when
we
are
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
surely
if
the
soul
were
ever
present
to
guard
and
maintain
life
it
would
be
standing
by
and
using
its
power
when
it
is
most
needed
we
have
no
occasion
for
help
when
we
are
not
in
danger
it
is
when
power
can
be
used
and
exercised
that
it
should
be
manifested
even
love
the
great
compelling
force
of
our
life
is
subject
to
the
variations
of
our
chemical
soul
its
attractions
and
repulsions
if
two
form
the
unit
of
reproduction
and
love
is
the
great
mating
medium
of
nature
then
once
it
is
animated
once
it
is
brought
into
existence
it
should
endure
permanently
and
the
possessors
should
at
least
enjoy
their
blissful
companionship
until
the
end
but
no
nature
would
entice
and
then
destroy
this
most
consuming
feeling
of
life
two
persons
can
start
life
with
the
most
irresistible
attraction
and
irrepressible
love
and
within
a
very
short
time
unless
they
guard
their
love
with
every
means
and
weapon
of
advanced
thought
and
reason
nature
through
her
duplicity
will
provide
searching
eyes
to
alienate
their
affection
causing
a
wretchedness
unparalleled
in
the
mental
miseries
of
mankind
life
the
saddest
state
of
all
is
when
two
persons
with
the
sacred
devotion
of
love
cohabit
and
the
happy
result
is
loving
children
and
yet
while
this
happy
family
free
from
nature
pitfalls
and
snares
are
living
in
a
peaceful
and
blissful
state
there
exists
the
devil
who
tempts
the
loving
wife
and
mother
to
follow
the
and
thereby
undoes
and
destroys
the
greatest
kingdom
of
life
the
devoted
husband
and
father
by
the
flash
of
an
eye
and
the
charm
of
a
face
can
forsake
his
sacred
ties
of
devotion
and
become
a
degenerate
and
outcast
with
death
as
his
only
salvation
in
either
case
nature
stands
by
with
a
sneer
upon
her
lips
and
god
forgets
his
obligation
to
his
children
but
the
final
analysis
proves
beyond
doubt
that
the
physical
attraction
is
responsible
for
this
action
and
who
can
deny
that
it
is
the
chemical
attraction
of
two
forces
that
produced
this
irresistible
desire
xii
if
the
life
we
live
be
a
kindergarten
or
infancy
of
a
larger
and
better
life
somewhere
else
nature
defeats
her
own
ends
because
myriads
pass
on
leave
here
with
the
most
dwarfed
intellects
utterly
unprepared
to
live
here
and
much
less
prepared
to
live
in
a
higher
state
and
on
a
more
lofty
plane
were
such
a
condition
true
that
this
is
but
a
transitory
existence
we
should
all
have
to
go
through
the
same
schooling
of
life
and
be
indelibly
impressed
with
its
lesson
with
conviction
and
understanding
that
the
same
mistakes
would
never
be
repeated
or
the
acquired
knowledge
would
be
constantly
and
forever
used
there
would
be
no
deaths
in
infancy
as
each
child
born
would
be
purposely
sent
here
neither
would
there
be
premature
deaths
as
no
one
could
leave
without
learning
his
lesson
there
would
be
a
fixed
standard
of
knowledge
and
development
that
we
would
be
required
to
attain
knowledge
or
whatever
condition
nature
imposed
would
be
our
destiny
and
we
would
devote
our
entire
life
to
its
acquirement
as
it
is
we
bend
our
efforts
and
use
our
strength
to
avoid
and
to
escape
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
if
our
life
were
given
to
us
in
order
to
pass
through
a
school
of
experience
the
simplest
truths
would
immediately
manifest
themselves
to
our
minds
and
conviction
would
be
instant
and
permanent
but
how
sadly
untrue
is
this
premise
for
thousands
aye
for
millions
of
years
the
people
have
been
stupefied
with
the
most
ignorant
and
foolish
superstition
an
instance
that
will
present
with
great
force
an
illustration
of
the
utter
folly
of
the
contention
that
we
are
living
on
this
planet
as
a
lesson
in
school
lies
in
the
fact
that
for
thousands
of
years
people
not
only
believed
but
religiously
guarded
the
belief
that
the
earth
was
flat
even
with
irrefutable
demonstrations
of
the
truth
there
are
some
people
who
either
can
not
or
will
not
accept
it
as
desirable
as
this
theory
of
a
transitory
state
may
be
it
is
even
contrary
to
nature
herself
the
entire
scheme
of
nature
seems
to
be
fashioned
upon
the
same
principle
as
our
life
the
fearful
struggle
of
the
elements
involved
squares
identically
with
our
own
existence
even
the
gigantic
constellations
flying
with
an
incalculable
velocity
leaving
destruction
and
desolation
in
their
tracks
meet
in
their
ignorant
and
blind
journey
the
same
fate
as
we
meet
recent
astronomical
discoveries
speak
of
a
struggle
constantly
taking
place
in
those
areas
the
belief
of
an
existence
after
death
is
so
untenable
in
the
face
of
many
scientific
discoveries
of
and
of
the
irrefutable
facts
that
are
constantly
staring
us
in
the
face
that
an
instance
or
two
are
all
that
are
necessary
to
prove
the
fallacy
of
such
a
belief
under
many
circumstances
we
are
unable
to
recognize
our
own
blood
relations
after
a
lapse
of
a
certain
length
of
time
parents
fail
to
know
their
children
and
children
their
parents
this
is
equally
true
in
every
comparison
and
degree
of
relationship
features
and
characteristics
undergo
such
a
decided
change
and
transformation
that
recognition
is
ofttimes
even
impossible
even
the
law
courts
are
continually
called
upon
to
determine
the
proper
identity
of
persons
to
establish
the
ownership
of
property
by
other
means
than
by
personal
identification
most
remarkable
of
all
under
new
conditions
we
do
not
recognize
ourselves
within
the
interval
of
only
a
few
seconds
try
this
if
you
would
seek
proof
and
convince
yourself
that
recognition
of
your
own
personality
is
momentarily
impossible
and
that
you
must
resort
to
other
senses
than
that
of
sight
to
identify
yourself
put
a
wig
upon
your
head
blacken
your
face
make
up
your
features
and
when
you
have
finished
and
are
completely
unaware
of
your
changed
appearance
look
into
the
mirror
for
your
reflection
and
feel
the
sensation
of
the
startling
fact
that
you
know
not
yourself
we
speak
of
changes
so
radical
in
a
person
appearance
that
we
often
say
we
could
not
recognize
him
in
a
thousand
years
what
a
ridiculous
presumption
it
is
then
to
maintain
that
we
live
after
death
when
senses
are
gone
and
perception
is
dead
again
how
anyone
can
say
that
when
we
die
we
go
to
heaven
is
too
childish
to
consider
because
when
we
die
instead
of
going
up
and
to
heaven
we
are
put
deep
into
the
ground
to
moulder
and
to
rot
away
what
a
conclusion
it
is
to
assume
that
we
live
after
death
minus
all
the
physical
characteristics
and
under
conditions
utterly
incomprehensible
to
our
minds
even
if
at
death
the
body
turned
into
invisible
gases
it
would
mean
and
prove
absolutely
nothing
if
we
live
after
death
by
what
means
can
one
person
communicate
with
another
we
can
not
feel
because
we
have
no
hands
we
can
not
see
because
we
have
no
eyes
we
can
not
smell
because
we
have
no
nose
we
can
not
hear
because
we
have
no
ears
we
can
not
taste
because
we
have
no
mouth
no
stomach
but
with
it
all
these
five
mediums
of
sense
are
dependent
upon
a
the
fact
that
we
suffer
the
loss
of
our
senses
even
before
death
because
of
the
complications
in
the
of
our
body
should
be
sufficient
proof
of
the
nonexistence
of
a
soul
and
the
utter
impossibility
of
a
life
after
death
unless
we
retain
and
maintain
our
sacred
ties
after
death
another
life
is
valueless
and
void
useless
and
unnecessary
it
is
a
fearful
sadness
to
think
that
the
ones
you
love
are
to
pass
away
into
nothingness
and
be
no
more
that
the
sparkling
eyes
will
be
dim
forever
that
the
rosy
cheeks
will
no
longer
glow
with
radiant
health
that
the
ruby
lips
will
fade
into
a
deathly
blue
motionless
and
forever
still
that
dimpled
hands
and
loving
arms
will
never
encircle
you
again
and
the
supremacy
and
tenderness
of
your
love
must
be
crushed
with
a
cold
and
callous
ferocity
but
sad
and
mournful
as
it
is
with
the
human
heart
beating
hopelessly
against
hope
for
only
one
more
chance
to
kiss
and
caress
and
love
the
one
you
so
dearly
cherish
it
is
nevertheless
only
too
poignantly
true
that
death
ends
all
death
means
nothing
to
the
affairs
of
the
world
to
be
taken
from
amid
the
world
in
such
an
condition
as
now
exists
is
like
taking
a
cup
of
water
from
an
pail
the
gap
is
immediately
filled
and
the
level
of
the
water
simultaneously
adjusted
leaving
absolutely
no
trace
of
what
has
been
withdrawn
only
the
individual
suffers
what
a
mighty
burst
of
heart
there
would
be
if
we
all
could
feel
and
suffer
at
the
same
time
nature
makes
no
difference
and
knows
no
distinction
between
the
living
and
the
dead
the
warm
and
tender
rays
of
the
sun
and
its
blistering
heat
fall
alike
upon
the
crying
innocent
babe
and
the
lifeless
unfeeling
corpse
the
sun
does
not
shine
to
give
us
its
necessary
heat
without
also
bringing
to
light
some
new
problem
and
pain
for
our
hearts
to
bear
murder
rape
and
greed
look
no
different
to
nature
than
goodness
virtue
and
unselfishness
tears
were
made
for
the
things
that
god
causes
laughter
is
the
result
of
man
efforts
xiii
it
is
man
labor
man
work
man
achievement
that
gives
us
the
little
desire
that
we
have
to
live
how
often
do
we
prefer
to
living
life
in
our
former
condition
after
our
efforts
have
brought
us
to
a
point
of
vantage
and
comfort
death
is
always
preferable
to
the
living
of
a
dog
life
and
yet
with
it
all
the
little
improvement
we
have
with
the
still
remaining
cruel
conditions
of
nature
left
to
endure
and
fight
has
not
been
worth
the
struggle
through
the
black
and
bleak
past
the
price
has
been
entirely
too
severe
for
the
little
that
has
been
gained
god
gives
man
nothing
man
gives
man
everything
what
sublime
courage
it
was
that
made
the
pathfinders
of
the
past
sacrifice
their
lives
in
order
that
their
principles
of
truth
might
triumph
so
that
another
link
might
be
made
in
the
chain
of
progress
that
is
endeavoring
to
break
the
spell
of
a
tyrant
power
you
must
be
made
to
know
that
for
whatever
desirable
condition
we
have
we
are
indebted
to
heroic
men
and
women
of
the
past
who
in
the
days
of
infant
progress
achieved
a
moral
physical
and
intellectual
triumph
the

every
part
and
particle
of
improvement
that
has
enriched
the
world
with
a
little
touch
of
human
comfort
are
the
result
of
the
heroic
labors
of
the
men

women
of
the
past
who
victoriously
fought
the
accursed
and
chaotic
forces
of
nature
so
as
to
make
life
and
living
a
little
better
but
at
every
step
and
stage
of
progress
the
dogmatists
have
exerted
their
influence
toward
retardation
what
these
dogmatists
were
unable
to
accomplish
through
fear
and
suppression
they
accomplished
through
ostracism
and
death
human
advancement
and
progress
are
foreign
to
the
believing
mind
the
dogmatists
are
concerned
only
with
the
supernatural
they
want
not
the
comforts
of
life
here
if
they
can
secure
those
benefits
hereafter
it
is
the
attitude
of
the
religious
to
belittle
anything
that
is
designed
for
human
betterment
their
philosophy
is
the
more
you
suffer
here
the
less
you
will
suffer
hereafter
their
humility
to
and
fear
of
this
unseen
power
is
the
most
degrading
trait
in
human
beings
it
is
a
frame
of
mind
not
only
despicable
and
a
hindrance
in
the
face
of
progress
but
even
antagonistic
to
and
destructive
of
all
things
worth
while
to
them
the
insanity
of
belief
is
of
paramount
importance
and
is
more
sacred
and
holy
than
human
life
aye
human
life
has
been
so
subordinated
to
this
superstitious
belief
that
it
meant
death
in
the
past
to
those
who
rejected
it
rather
observe
some
holy
day
than
perform
work
to
help
some
fellow
human
being
in
distress
murder
rather
than
eat
meat
on
a
forbidden
day
this
frame
of
mind
is
one
of
the
mental
mysteries
that
science
has
yet
to
solve
xiv
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
was
discussed
and
its
circumference
scientifically
measured
hundreds
of
years
before
the
supposed
birth
of
christ
and
had
not
the
god
believers
been
so
persistent
in
forcing
their
belief
upon
others
and
had
not
christianity
been
born
i
can
see
how
the
discovery
of
america
would
have
been
accomplished
about
a
thousand
years
before
the
discovery
by
columbus
and
the
incalculable
progress
which
would
have
been
the
consequence
would
have
carried
mankind
beyond
the
boldest
imagination
of
and
placed
us
a
thousand
years
nearer
civilization
hero
a
mathematician
who
lived
at
the
time
when
the
greek
minds
were
the
marvel
of
the
world
invented
a
steam
engine
which
was
used
in
experiments
and
was
rapidly
nearing
completion
and
perfection
when
unfortunately
ignorant
and
destructive
religion
that
was
madly
trampling
upon
everything
of
value
destroyed
the
famous
alexandrian
library
wherein
was
kept
a
model
of
this
engine
it
also
swept
away
the
incalculable
wealth
of
knowledge
that
had
required
ages
to
accumulate
and
thereby
completely
annihilated
the
most
priceless
possessions
that
the
human
race
ever
owned
but
that
is
not
all
it
is
only
a
fragment
for
history
at
every
stage
of
life
shows
the
continual
strife
between
the
forces
of
progress
and
the
religious
fanatic
and
god
believer
what
is
that
strange
form
of
insanity
that
prompts
people
to
torture
and
to
destroy
those
who
seek
to
emancipate
them
from
the
of
and
from
the
deluded
belief
in
a
hereafter
the
attitude
of
all
each
and
every
one
of
us
should
ever
be
the
desire
and
willingness
to
greet
a
new
idea
to
support
a
new
thought
to
try
a
new
proposal
to
do
all
in
our
power
to
uphold
the
forces
of
progress
to
lend
our
help
and
to
devote
our
energies
in
any
direction
that
will
ultimately
lead
us
from
the
cruel
forces
and
narrow
limitations
that
are
our
lot
to
share
to
those
who
have
no
thought
for
these
things
who
care
not
what
forces
and
conditions
man
must
face
who
take
without
thought
and
give
only
through
compulsion
whose
condition
made
possible
only
by
the
heroic
work
of
the
martyrs
of
progress
make
of
them
personal
heroes
whose
life
is
wrapped
within
the
flicker
of
a
day
who
do
not
know
do
not
realize
and
do
not
care
about
the
fearful
suffering
of
the
world
i
say
to
them
to
strut
their
intoxicated
hour
and
pass
away
the
sooner
they
live
their
lives
and
the
sooner
they
die
the
better
for
the
earth
it
needs
fertilization
were
we
as
mentally
progressive
as
we
are
materially
advanced
what
a
wonderful
and
magnificent
improvement
over
the
present
living
conditions
we
would
be
enjoying
every
new
invention
every
new
improvement
would
be
immediately
and
universally
installed
and
every
old
and
antiquated
instrument
and
method
would
be
discarded
and
destroyed
that
which
now
seems
only
within
the
command
of
the
households
of
the
immensely
wealthy
would
be
as
popularly
used
and
enjoyed
as
the
now
commonly
used
articles
in
the
poorest
households
think
of
existing
in
a
predominant
percentage
of
dwellings
for
human
beings
where
there
is
not
found
the
essential
bathtub
or
the
still
more
essential
toilet
room
governments
are
instituted
for
the
people
benefit
and
shame
upon
such
a
government
in
an
enlightened
age
like
that
tolerates
such
a
condition
when
that
government
possesses
the
men
the
means
the
intellect
and
the
materials
to
electrify
the
world
the
first
and
foremost
essential
in
higher
development
is
the
comfort
and
conveniences
in
a
home
these
are
some
of
the
conditions
that
the
progressive
minds
of
the
world
are
trying
to
solve
and
remedy
it
is
only
a
question
of
how
much
longer
the
majority
of
people
will
pay
homage
to
an
imaginary
god
for
imaginary
benefits
in
an
imaginary
life
after
death
xv
it
is
the
antagonism
of
the
dogmatic
world
and
the
apathy
of
the
rest
that
is
the
cause
of
the
mental
progress
of
the
world
not
keeping
pace
with
the
material
progress
better
still
the
universal
application
of
the
material
progress
has
been
far
in
advance
of
the
universal
acceptance
of
mental
achievement
the
automobile
the
gigantic
ocean
liner
the
talking
machine
the
electric
fan
the
elevator
the
telephone
and
the
other
marvelous
achievements
of
man
are
being
used
by
the
greater
portion
of
the
people
whose
mental
status
belongs
to
the
wheelbarrow
the
simple
chair
the
ox
cart
and
the
tallow
candle
slight
is
the
realization
by
the
users
and
beneficiaries
of
modern
methods
of
the
heroic
struggles
and
battles
that
the
great
men
and
women
of
the
past
suffered
to
make
possible
these
accomplishments
oh
how
many
suffered
torture
and
death
at
the
hands
of
the
very
people
they
were
striving
to
benefit
this
same
fate
has
been
met
by
all
the
brave
and
courageous
during
the
past
who
have
made
any
attempt
to
broaden
the
life
and
to
ease
the
pain
of
the
troubled
heart
of
humanity
the
unselfish
endeavors
of
man
have
made
it
possible
to
take
the
dumb
matter
of
earth
and
mold
it
so
the
voices
of
the
present
can
be
heard
by
the
ears
of
the
future
so
that
several
generations
may
hear
and
know
with
a
touch
of
human
affection
the
traits
features
and
characteristics
of
their
ancestors
language
gives
us
their
thoughts
the
camera
gives
us
their
natural
features
and
the
phonograph
their
actual
living
voices
nature
never
did
so
much
as
far
as
nature
is
concerned
bastardy
may
rule
the
world
one
of
the
comforts
of
life
is
that
we
live
again
in
actions
and
scenes
which
although
they
are
apart
from
our
own
lives
really
belong
to
the
past
or
future
races
but
nature
sees
to
it
that
the
births
and
deaths
the
knowledge
and
acquaintance
of
each
and
every
generation
are
so
closely
allied
that
none
of
us
is
allowed
to
escape
the
suffering
of
the
world
and
the
agony
of
life
and
death
no
person
can
avoid
the
pain
and
the
terrible
fear
that
all
must
endure
no
one
person
can
live
move
about
and
possess
the
varied
improvements
of
the
earth
materials
all
by
himself
he
is
indebted
to
others
for
their
accomplishments
and
they
in
turn
are
indebted
to
him
for
the
improvements
he
renders
in
short
we
are
all
so
closely
allied
with
the
actions
and
lives
of
one
another
that
there
should
be
a
mutual
appreciation
and
a
common
understanding
among
all
the
farmer
may
know
nothing
about
manufacturing
the
manufacturer
may
know
nothing
about
farming
the
artist
the
explorer
the
thinker
the
inventor
and
the
scientist
may
know
nothing
about
any
field
of
endeavor
other
than
his
own
yet
all
are
with
such
a
condition
existing
and
with
the
uncertainty
of
life
forever
staring
us
in
the
face
and
one
from
its
terrible
enactment
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
why
there
exist
so
tenaciously
in
the
human
heart
all
the
petty
and
aggravating
tempers
prejudices
and
jealousies
what
man
has
done
with
the
forces
of
nature
are
inspiring
deeds
what
progress
has
been
made
in
opposing
the
forces
of
nature
is
marvelous
what
man
will
accomplish
in
the
future
with
the
arrogant
forces
of
nature
stimulates
our
hearts
with
the
sweet
satisfaction
of
a
victory
of
the
first
magnitude
but
in
the
final
analysis
what
does
it
avail
us
geologists
tell
us
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
materials
that
we
have
taken
from
the
field
of
nature
consists
of
the
buried
bones
and
bodies
of
our
ancient
ancestors
who
passed
through
greater
periods
of
agony
torment
disease
and
death
than
we
are
finally
and
eventually
to
meet
what
sort
of
crust
in
the
earth
formation
are
we
to
make
what
will
be
the
product
of
the
future
living
forces
that
will
utilize
the
materials
that
our
bodies
will
make
what
will
be
the
future
living
forces
it
is
fearfully
sad
to
contemplate
that
life
must
continue
and
be
subject
to
the
miserable
laws
that
now
govern
it
insect
man
with
his
almost
tireless
industry
makes
clothes
to
cover
his
ugly
and
awkward
body
builds
houses
to
shelter
him
from
the
winds
and
the
torrents
of
nature
fashions
glittering
palaces
of
amusement
to
cheer
his
troubled
heart
compounds
anæsthetics
to
ease
his
pain
carves
wood
to
replace
his
broken
limbs
molds
metal
to
take
the
place
of
those
things
that
nature
has
made
inadequate
for
his
use
in
short
man
has
improved
upon
nature
to
uphold
his
frail
body
to
strengthen
his
weak
bones
and
to
soothe
his
tender
heart
that
man
fighting
the
forces
of
nature
has
been
able
to
accomplish
so
much
is
simply
glorious
and
this
progress
is
an
achievement
of
such
wonderful
magnitude
that
we
are
thrilled
at
the
thought
and
bow
in
grateful
recognition
for
the
benefits
derived
and
the
relief
enjoyed
but
why
did
not
god
institute
all
the
benefits
for
the
immediate
use
of
man
so
they
could
be
enjoyed
upon
the
first
manifestation
of
his
understanding
why
was
it
necessary
to
go
through
the
fearful
period
of
past
history
and
gain
only
after
a
most
gigantic
struggle
the
few
things
that
we
now
use
for
our
comfort
that
these
things
could
have
been
done
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
man
has
done
them
fundamentally
they
always
existed
man
has
only
discovered
and
applied
them
and
these
things
that
we
have
gained
from
the
struggles
of
the
past
would
have
been
equally
enjoyed
by
those
who
lived
before
us
with
the
same
degree
of
benefit
just
as
the
future
will
find
use
and
enjoy
those
things
that
we
do
not
possess
and
without
which
we
shall
be
pinched
and
pained
through
the
of
this
troublesome
life
i
brand
as
brutal
tyranny
this
scheme
of
life
that
forces
us
to
be
a
link
in
a
long
series
of
lives
to
produce
something
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
that
we
ourselves
imperatively
need
but
shall
not
possess
i
cry
and
denounce
and
plead
in
behalf
of
future
humanity
to
circumvent
and
to
defeat
this
sorry
scheme
of
life
that
uses
us
as
an
instrument
to
produce
something
that
we
can
not
use
do
not
know
about
and
have
not
the
understanding
to
comprehend
xvi
in
god
we
trust
on
coins
that
represent
our
labor
and
our
endeavor
is
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
courage
and
independence
of
the
people
and
a
stinging
rebuke
to
those
responsible
for
our
progress
a
motto
that
more
truthfully
represents
our
material
progress
and
intellectual
development
would
be
in
science
we
trust
or
humanity
and
justice
our
aim
the
more
we
eliminate
god
from
us
the
more
we
are
without
the
better
for
us
all
the
better
for
humanity
the
better
for
all
the
world
the
less
we
know
of
god
the
less
god
that
is
in
us
the
more
we
become
the
greatest
most
frightful
and
destructive
wars
of
all
time
have
been
those
which
were
started
in
defense
of
god
as
if
he
cared
what
man
says
or
does
the
most
frightful
and
torturous
instruments
ever
conceived
by
man
are
those
that
were
made
to
force
people
to
believe
in
god
the
history
of
religious
persecution
and
torture
is
the
horror
of
the
world
may
i
ask
where
was
god
and
what
did
he
do
to
stop
this
frightful
nightmare
of
torture
committed
in
his
name
and
may
i
answer
for
you
that
he
was
where
moses
was
when
the
light
went
out
remember
this
there
will
never
be
a
solution
to
any
of
our
fundamental
problems
and
mankind
will
never
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
be
free
as
long
as
there
exists
in
the
human
mind
the
insanity
of
religious
belief
as
long
as
god
occupies
a
portion
of
our
thoughts
mankind
must
be
content
to
suffer
the
hatred
and
antagonism
of
man
let
us
make
up
our
minds
now
let
us
resolve
now
to
stop
fighting
one
another
and
fight
god
by
helping
one
another
let
us
stop
fighting
our
fellow
prisoners
and
fellow
sufferers
and
fight
god
let
us
help
our
fellow
prisoners
and
fellow
sufferers
let
us
cleanse
our
minds
of
this
superstitious
poison
of
an
after
life
and
work
and
labor
for
the
good
and
welfare
of
here
and
now
we
possess
the
knowledge
and
the
means
and
within
the
span
of
only
one
day
could
bring
about
the
brotherhood
of
man
we
could
eliminate
hatred
from
our
hearts
and
instill
justice
as
our
guide
we
could
eradicate
poverty
from
our
midst
and
bring
happiness
to
sorrowing
mankind
we
could
blot
out
tyranny
among
men
and
exchange
it
for
the
priceless
legacy
of
freedom
and
make
the
relation
between
man
and
man
bear
some
semblance
of
humanity
but
and
i
say
this
with
redoubled
conviction
and
with
all
the
power
force
energy
and
vehemence
that
i
possess
if
we
are
nature
best
endeavor
if
man
is
nature
best
product
if
the
natural
world
is
incapable
of
any
improvement
and
life
will
forever
be
made
to
submit
to
the
tyrannical
conditions
of
nature
then
it
were
better
ten
thousand
times
over
that
life
were
never
called
into
existence
and
that
the
universe
were
null
and
void

dear
sir
i
received
your
book
the
tyranny
of
god
and
have
read
it
through
i
think
as
you
do
that
death
ends
all
yet
i
do
not
feel
certain
because
there
are
many
facts
that
seem
to
show
that
the
real
units
of
life
are
not
the
animal
mechanism
itself
but
groups
of
millions
of
small
entities
living
in
the
visible
cells
the
animal
being
their
mechanism
for
navigating
the
environment
and
when
the
mechanism
fails
to
function
die
the
groups
go
out
into
space
to
go
thru
another
cycle
the
entities
are
each
highly
organized
and
perform
their
allotted
task
if
there
is
anything
like
this
we
still
have
a
fighting
chance
you
have
doubtless
read
interviews
