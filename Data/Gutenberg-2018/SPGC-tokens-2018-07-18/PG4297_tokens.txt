ransom

gissing
chapter
i
on
the
station
platform
at
dudley
port
in
the
dusk
of
a
february
afternoon
people
waited
for
the
train
to
birmingham
a
wind
had
loaded
the
air
with
moisture
which
dripped
at
moments
thinly
and
sluggishly
from
a
featureless
sky
the
lamps
just
lighted
cast
upon
wet
wood
and
metal
a
pale
yellow
shimmer
voices
sounded
with
peculiar
clearness
so
did
the
rumble
of
a
porter
barrow
laden
with
luggage
from
a
foundry
hard
by
came
the
muffled
rhythmic
thunder
of
mighty
blows
this
and
the
long
note
of
an
wailing
far
off
seemed
to
intensify
the
stillness
of
the
air
as
gloomy
day
passed
into
gloomier
night
in
clear
daylight
the
high
uncovered
platform
would
have
offered
an
outlook
over
the
surrounding
country
but
at
this
hour
no
horizon
was
discernible
buildings
near
at
hand
rude
masses
of
grimy
brick
stood
out
against
a
grey
confused
background
among
them
rose
a
turret
which
vomited
crimson
flame
this
fierce
infernal
glare
seemed
to
lack
the
irradiating
quality
of
earthly
fires
with
hard
though
fluctuating
outline
it
leapt
towards
the
kindred
night
and
diffused
a
blotchy
darkness
in
the
opposite
direction
over
towards
dudley
town
appeared
spots
of
lurid
glow
but
on
the
scarred
and
barren
plain
which
extends
to
birmingham
there
had
settled
so
thick
an
obscurity
vapours
from
above
blending
with
earthly
reek
that
all
tile
beacons
of
fiery
toil
were
wrapped
and
hidden
of
the
waiting
travellers
two
kept
apart
from
the
rest
pacing
this
way
and
that
but
independently
of
each
other
they
were
men
of
dissimilar
appearance
the
one
comfortably
and
expensively
dressed
his
age
about
fifty
his
visage
bearing
the
stamp
of
commerce
the
other
younger
by
more
than
twenty
years
habited
in
a
way
which
made
it
difficult
to
as
certain
his
social
standing
and
looking
about
him
with
eyes
suggestive
of
anything
but
prudence
or
content
now
and
then
they
exchanged
a
glance
he
of
the
high
hat
and
caped
ulster
betrayed
an
interest
in
the
younger
man
who
in
his
turn
took
occasion
to
observe
the
other
from
a
distance
with
show
of
dubious
recognition
the
trill
of
an
electric
signal
followed
by
a
clanging
bell
brought
them
both
to
a
pause
and
they
stood
only
two
or
three
yards
apart
presently
a
light
flashed
through
the
thickening
dusk
there
was
roaring
grinding
creaking
and
a
final
yell
of
wheels
making
at
once
for
the
nearest
carriage
the
man
in
the
seedy
overcoat
sprang
to
a
place
and
threw
himself
carelessly
back
a
moment
and
he
was
followed
by
the
second
passenger
who
seated
himself
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
compartment
once
more
they
looked
at
each
other
but
without
change
of
countenance
tickets
were
collected
for
there
would
be
no
stoppage
before
birmingham
then
the
door
slammed
and
the
two
men
were
alone
together
two
or
three
minutes
after
the
train
had
started
the
elder
man
leaned
forward
moved
slightly
and
spoke
excuse
me
i
think
your
name
must
be
hilliard
what
then
was
the
brusque
reply
you
do
remember
me
scoundrels
are
common
enough
returned
the
other
crossing
his
legs
but
i
remember
you
for
all
that
the
insult
was
thrown
out
with
a
peculiarly
reckless
air
it
astounded
the
hearer
who
sat
for
an
instant
with
staring
eyes
and
lips
apart
then
the
blood
rushed
to
his
cheeks
if
i
had
just
about
twice
your
muscle
my
lad
he
answered
angrily
i
make
you
repent
that
and
be
more
careful
with
your
tongue
in
future
now
mind
what
you
say
we
a
quiet
quarter
of
an
hour
before
us
and
i
might
alter
my
mind
the
young
man
laughed
contemptuously
he
was
tall
but
slightly
built
and
had
delicate
hands
so
you
turned
out
a
blackguard
have
you
pursued
his
companion
whose
name
was
dengate
i
heard
something
about
that
from
whom
you
drink
i
am
told
i
suppose
that
your
condition
now
well
no
not
just
now
answered
hilliard
he
spoke
the
language
of
an
educated
man
but
with
a
trace
of
the
midland
accent
speech
had
less
refinement
what
do
you
mean
by
your
insulting
talk
then
i
spoke
to
you
civilly
and
i
answered
as
i
thought
fit
the
respectable
citizen
sat
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
scrutinised
the
other
sallow
features
you
been
drinking
i
can
see
i
had
something
to
say
to
you
but
i
better
leave
it
for
another
time
hilliard
flashed
a
look
of
scorn
and
said
sternly
i
am
as
sober
as
you
are
then
just
give
me
civil
answers
to
civil
questions
questions
what
right
have
you
to
question
me
it
for
your
own
advantage
you
called
me
scoundrel
what
did
you
mean
by
that
that
the
name
i
give
to
fellows
who
go
bankrupt
to
get
rid
of
their
debts
is
it
said
dengate
with
a
superior
smile
that
only
shows
how
little
you
know
of
the
world
my
lad
you
got
it
from
your
father
i
daresay
he
had
a
rough
way
of
talking
a
disagreeable
habit
of
telling
the
truth
i
know
all
about
it
your
father
was
a
man
of
business
and
could
see
things
from
a
business
point
of
view
now
what
i
just
want
to
say
to
you
is
this
there
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
commercial
failure
and
rascality
if
you
go
down
to
liverpool
and
ask
men
of
credit
for
their
opinion
about
charles
edward
dengate
you
have
a
lesson
that
would
profit
you
i
can
see
you
one
of
the
young
chaps
who
think
a
precious
deal
of
themselves
i
often
coming
across
them
nowadays
and
i
generally
give
them
a
piece
of
my
mind
hilliard
smiled
if
you
gave
them
the
whole
it
would
be
no
great
generosity
eh
yes
i
see
you
had
a
glass
or
two
and
it
makes
you
witty
but
wait
a
bit
i
was
devilish
near
thrashing
you
a
few
minutes
ago
but
i
do
it
say
what
you
like
i
do
like
vulgar
rows
no
more
do
i
remarked
hilliard
and
i
have
fought
since
i
was
a
boy
but
for
your
own
satisfaction
i
can
tell
you
it
a
wise
resolve
not
to
interfere
with
me
the
temptation
to
rid
the
world
of
one
such
man
as
you
might
prove
too
strong
there
was
a
force
of
meaning
in
these
words
quietly
as
they
were
uttered
which
impressed
the
listener
you
come
to
a
bad
end
my
lad
hardly
it
unlikely
that
i
shall
ever
be
rich
oh
you
one
of
that
sort
are
you
i
come
across
socialistic
fellows
but
look
here
i
talking
civilly
and
i
say
again
it
for
your
advantage
i
had
a
respect
for
your
father
and
i
liked
your
brother
i
sorry
to
hear
he
dead
please
keep
your
sorrow
to
yourself
all
right
all
right
i
understand
you
a
draughtsman
at
kenn
and
bodditch
i
daresay
you
are
capable
of
understanding
that
hilliard
planted
his
elbow
in
the
window
of
the
carriage
and
propped
his
cheek
on
his
hand
yes
and
a
few
other
things
rejoined
the
man
how
to
make
money
for
well
have
you
any
insult
ready
the
other
looked
out
at
a
row
of
flaring
chimneys
which
the
train
was
rushing
past
he
kept
silence
go
down
to
liverpool
pursued
dengate
and
make
inquiries
about
me
you
find
i
have
as
good
a
reputation
as
any
man
living
he
laboured
this
point
it
was
evident
that
he
seriously
desired
to
establish
his
probity
and
importance
in
the
young
man
eyes
nor
did
anything
in
his
look
or
speech
conflict
with
such
claims
he
had
hard
but
not
disagreeable
features
and
gave
proof
of
an
easy
temper
paying
one
debts
said
hilliard
is
fatal
to
reputation
you
use
words
you
do
understand
there
no
such
thing
as
a
debt
except
what
recognised
by
the
laws
i
should
wonder
if
you
think
of
going
into
parliament
you
are
just
the
man
to
make
laws
well
who
knows
what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
that
if
your
father
were
alive
at
this
moment
i
should
admit
that
he
had
claim
upon
me
for
one
penny
it
was
because
i
understood
it
already
that
i
called
you
a
scoundrel
now
be
careful
my
lad
exclaimed
dengate
as
again
he
winced
under
the
epithet
my
temper
may
get
the
better
of
me
and
i
should
be
sorry
for
it
i
got
into
this
carriage
with
you
of
course
i
had
a
ticket
because
i
wanted
to
form
an
opinion
of
your
character
i
been
told
you
drink
and
i
see
that
you
do
and
sorry
for
it
you
be
losing
your
place
before
long
and
you
go
down
now
look
here
you
called
me
foul
names
and
you
done
your
best
to
rile
me
now
i
going
to
make
you
ashamed
of
yourself
hilliard
fixed
the
speaker
with
his
scornful
eyes
the
last
words
had
moved
him
to
curiosity
i
can
excuse
a
good
deal
in
a
man
with
an
empty
pocket
pursued
the
other
i
been
there
myself
i
know
how
it
makes
you
feel
how
much
do
you
earn
by
the
bye
mind
you
own
business
all
right
i
suppose
it
about
two
pounds
a
week
would
you
like
to
know
what
in
come
is
well
something
like
two
pounds
an
hour
reckoning
eight
hours
as
the
working
day
there
a
difference
there
it
comes
of
minding
my
business
you
see
you
never
make
anything
like
it
you
find
it
easier
to
abuse
people
who
work
than
to
work
yourself
now
if
you
go
down
to
liverpool
and
ask
how
i
got
to
my
present
position
you
find
it
the
result
of
hard
and
honest
work
understand
that
honest
work
and
forgetting
to
pay
your
debts
threw
in
the
young
man
it
eight
years
since
i
owed
any
man
a
penny
the
people
i
owe
money
to
were
sensible
men
of
business
all
except
your
father
and
he
never
could
see
things
in
the
right
light
i
went
through
the
bankruptcy
court
and
i
made
arrangements
that
satisfied
my
creditors
i
should
have
satisfied
your
father
too
only
he
died
you
paid
tuppence
in
the
pound
no
it
was
five
shillings
and
my
creditors
sensible
men
of
business
were
satisfied
now
look
here
i
owed
your
father
four
hundred
and
pounds
but
he
did
rank
as
an
ordinary
creditor
and
if
i
had
paid
him
after
my
bankruptcy
it
would
have
been
just
because
i
felt
a
respect
for
him
not
because
he
had
any
legal
claim
i
to
pay
him
understand
that
hilliard
smiled
just
then
a
block
signal
caused
the
train
to
slacken
speed
darkness
had
fallen
and
lights
glimmered
from
some
cottages
by
the
line
you
do
believe
me
added
dengate
i
do
the
prosperous
man
bit
his
lower
lip
and
sat
gazing
at
the
lamp
in
the
carriage
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
there
was
no
sound
but
the
throbbing
of
the
engine
well
listen
to
me
dengate
resumed
you
turning
out
badly
and
any
money
you
get
you
pretty
sure
to
make
a
bad
use
of
but
he
assumed
an
air
of
great
solemnity
all
the
same
now
listen
i
listening
just
to
show
you
the
kind
of
a
man
i
am
and
to
make
you
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
i
going
to
pay
you
the
money
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
unbroken
stillness
the
men
gazed
at
each
other
dengate
superbly
triumphant
hilliard
incredulous
but
betraying
excitement
i
going
to
pay
you
four
hundred
and
pounds
dengate
repeated
no
less
and
no
more
it
is
a
legal
debt
so
i
shall
pay
no
interest
but
go
with
me
when
we
get
to
birmingham
and
you
shall
have
my
cheque
for
four
hundred
and
pounds
the
train
began
to
move
on
hilliard
had
uncrossed
his
legs
and
sat
bending
forward
his
eyes
on
vacancy
does
that
alter
your
opinion
of
me
asked
the
other
i
believe
it
till
i
have
cashed
the
cheque
you
one
of
those
young
fellows
who
think
so
much
of
themselves
they
no
good
opinion
to
spare
for
anyone
else
and
what
more
still
half
a
mind
to
give
you
a
good
thrashing
before
i
give
you
the
cheque
there
just
about
time
and
i
should
wonder
if
it
did
you
good
you
want
some
of
the
conceit
taken
out
of
you
my
lad
hilliard
seemed
not
to
hear
this
again
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
other
countenance
do
you
say
you
are
going
to
pay
me
four
hundred
pounds
he
asked
slowly
four
hundred
and
you
go
to
the
devil
with
it
but
that
no
business
of
mine
there
just
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
if
this
is
a
joke
keep
out
of
my
way
after
you
played
it
out
that
all
it
is
a
joke
and
one
thing
i
have
to
tell
i
reserve
to
myself
the
right
of
thrashing
you
if
i
feel
in
the
humour
for
it
hilliard
gave
a
laugh
then
threw
himself
back
into
the
corner
and
did
not
speak
again
until
the
train
pulled
up
at
new
street
station
chapter
ii
an
hour
later
he
was
at
old
square
waiting
for
the
tram
to
aston
huge
vehicles
came
and
went
whirling
about
the
open
space
with
monitory
amid
a
press
of
workfolk
hilliard
clambered
to
a
place
on
the
top
and
lit
his
pipe
he
did
not
look
the
same
man
who
had
waited
gloomily
at
dudley
port
his
eyes
gleamed
with
life
answering
a
remark
addressed
to
him
by
a
neighbour
on
the
car
he
spoke
jovially
no
rain
was
falling
but
the
streets
shone
wet
and
muddy
under
lurid
just
above
the
appeared
the
full
moon
a
reddish
disk
blurred
athwart
floating
vapour
the
car
drove
northward
speedily
passing
from
the
region
of
main
streets
and
great
edifices
into
a
squalid
district
of
factories
and
workshops
and
crowded
at
aston
church
the
young
man
alighted
and
walked
rapidly
for
five
minutes
till
he
reached
a
row
of
small
modern
houses
socially
they
represented
a
step
or
two
upwards
in
the
gradation
which
at
birmingham
begins
with
the
numbered
court
and
culminates
in
the
mansions
of
edgbaston
he
knocked
at
a
door
and
was
answered
by
a
girl
who
nodded
recognition
hilliard
in
just
tell
her
i
here
there
was
a
natural
abruptness
in
his
voice
but
it
had
a
kindly
note
and
a
pleasant
smile
accompanied
it
after
a
brief
delay
he
received
permission
to
go
upstairs
where
the
door
of
a
stood
open
within
was
a
young
woman
slight
pale
and
pretty
who
showed
something
of
embarrassment
though
her
face
made
him
welcome
i
expected
you
sooner
business
kept
me
back
well
little
girl
the
table
was
spread
for
tea
and
at
one
end
of
it
on
a
high
chair
sat
a
child
of
four
years
old
hilliard
kissed
her
and
stroked
her
curly
hair
and
talked
with
playful
affection
this
little
girl
was
his
niece
the
child
of
his
elder
brother
who
had
died
three
years
ago
the
poorly
furnished
room
and
her
own
attire
proved
that
hilliard
had
but
narrow
resources
in
her
widowhood
nor
did
she
appear
a
woman
of
much
courage
tears
had
thinned
her
cheeks
and
her
delicate
hands
had
suffered
noticeably
from
unwonted
household
work
hilliard
remarked
something
unusual
in
her
behaviour
this
evening
she
was
restless
and
kept
regarding
him
askance
as
if
in
apprehension
a
letter
from
her
in
which
she
merely
said
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
had
summoned
him
hither
from
dudley
as
a
rule
they
saw
each
other
but
once
a
month
no
bad
news
i
hope
he
remarked
aside
to
her
as
he
took
his
place
at
the
table
oh
no
i
tell
you
afterwards
very
soon
after
the
meal
hilliard
took
the
child
away
and
put
her
to
bed
during
her
absence
the
visitor
sat
brooding
a
peculiar
on
his
face
she
came
back
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
fire
but
did
not
sit
down
well
what
is
it
asked
her
much
as
he
might
have
spoken
to
the
little
girl
i
have
something
very
serious
to
talk
about
maurice
have
you
all
right
go
ahead
i
i
am
so
very
much
afraid
i
shall
offend
you
the
young
man
laughed
not
very
likely
i
can
take
a
good
deal
from
you
she
stood
with
her
hands
on
the
back
of
the
chair
and
as
he
looked
at
her
hilliard
saw
her
pale
cheeks
grow
warm
it
seem
very
strange
to
you
maurice
nothing
will
seem
strange
after
an
adventure
i
had
this
afternoon
you
shall
hear
about
it
presently
tell
me
your
story
first
that
like
a
woman
all
right
i
tell
you
i
met
that
scoundrel
dengate
and
he
paid
me
the
money
he
owed
my
father
he
has
it
oh
really
see
here
a
cheque
and
i
think
it
likely
i
can
turn
it
into
cash
the
blackguard
has
been
doing
well
at
liverpool
i
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
the
reptile
but
he
seems
to
have
given
me
this
because
i
abused
him
i
hurt
his
vanity
and
he
could
resist
the
temptation
to
astonish
me
he
thinks
i
shall
go
about
proclaiming
him
a
noble
fellow
four
hundred
and
pounds
there
it
is
he
tossed
the
piece
of
paper
into
the
air
with
boyish
glee
and
only
just
caught
it
as
it
was
fluttering
into
the
fire
oh
be
careful
cried
hilliard
i
told
him
he
was
a
scoundrel
and
he
began
by
threatening
to
thrash
me
i
very
glad
he
did
try
it
was
in
the
train
and
i
know
very
well
i
should
have
strangled
him
it
would
have
been
awkward
you
know
oh
maurice
how
you
well
here
the
money
and
half
of
it
is
yours
mine
oh
no
after
all
you
have
given
me
besides
i
want
it
how
that
their
eyes
mete
hilliard
again
saw
the
flush
in
her
cheeks
and
began
to
guess
its
explanation
he
looked
puzzled
interested
do
i
know
him
was
his
next
inquiry
should
you
think
it
very
wrong
of
me
she
moved
aside
from
the
line
of
his
gaze
i
could
imagine
how
you
would
take
it
it
all
depends
who
is
the
man
still
shrinking
towards
a
position
where
hilliard
could
not
easily
observe
her
the
young
widow
told
her
story
she
had
consented
to
marry
a
man
of
whom
her
knew
little
but
the
name
one
ezra
marr
he
was
turned
forty
a
widower
without
children
and
belonged
to
a
class
of
small
employers
of
labour
known
in
birmingham
as
little
masters
the
contrast
between
such
a
man
and
maurice
brother
was
sufficiently
pronounced
but
the
widow
nervously
did
her
best
to
show
ezra
marr
in
a
favourable
light
and
then
she
added
after
a
pause
while
hilliard
was
reflecting
i
could
go
on
being
a
burden
on
you
how
very
few
men
would
have
done
what
you
have
stop
a
minute
is
the
real
reason
if
so
hurriedly
she
interposed
that
was
only
one
of
the
reasons
only
one
hilliard
knew
very
well
that
her
marriage
had
not
been
entirely
successful
it
seemed
to
him
very
probable
that
with
a
husband
of
the
artisan
class
a
vigorous
and
fellow
she
would
be
better
mated
than
in
the
former
instance
he
felt
sorry
for
his
little
niece
but
there
again
sentiment
doubtless
conflicted
with
a
few
more
questions
and
it
became
clear
to
him
that
he
had
no
ground
of
resistance
very
well
most
likely
you
are
doing
a
wise
thing
and
half
this
money
is
yours
you
find
it
useful
the
discussion
of
this
point
was
interrupted
by
a
tap
at
the
door
hilliard
after
leaving
the
room
for
a
moment
returned
with
rosy
countenance
he
is
here
she
murmured
i
thought
i
should
like
you
to
meet
him
this
evening
do
you
mind
marr
entered
a
favourable
specimen
of
his
kind
strong
comely
frank
of
look
and
speech
hilliard
marvelled
somewhat
at
his
choice
of
the
frail
and
timid
little
widow
and
hoped
upon
marriage
would
follow
no
repentance
a
friendly
conversation
between
the
two
men
confirmed
them
in
mutual
good
opinion
at
length
hilliard
spoke
of
the
offer
of
money
made
by
her
i
do
feel
i
any
right
to
it
she
said
after
explaining
the
circumstances
you
know
what
maurice
has
done
for
me
i
always
felt
i
was
robbing
him
i
wanted
to
say
something
about
that
put
in
the
ezra
i
want
to
tell
you
hilliard
that
you
a
man
i
proud
to
know
and
proud
to
shake
hands
with
and
if
my
view
goes
for
anything
emily
wo
take
a
penny
of
what
you
offering
her
i
should
think
it
wrong
and
mean
it
is
about
time
that
my
way
of
thinking
that
you
looked
after
your
own
interests
emily
has
no
claim
to
a
share
in
this
money
and
what
more
i
do
wish
her
to
take
it
very
well
said
hilliard
i
tell
you
what
we
do
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
shall
be
put
aside
for
the
little
girl
you
ca
make
any
objection
to
that
the
mother
glanced
doubtfully
at
her
future
husband
but
marr
again
spoke
with
emphasis
yes
i
do
object
if
you
do
mind
me
saying
it
i
quite
able
to
look
after
the
little
girl
and
the
fact
is
i
want
her
to
grow
up
looking
to
me
as
her
father
and
getting
all
she
has
from
me
only
of
course
i
mean
nothing
but
what
friendly
but
there
it
is
i
rather
winnie
did
have
the
money
this
man
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
his
mind
hilliard
understood
that
any
insistence
would
only
disturb
the
harmony
of
the
occasion
he
waved
a
hand
smiled
and
said
no
more
about
nine
he
left
the
house
and
walked
to
aston
church
while
he
stood
there
waiting
for
the
tram
a
voice
fell
upon
his
ear
that
caused
him
to
look
round
crouched
by
the
entrance
to
the
churchyard
was
a
beggar
in
filthy
rags
his
face
hideously
bandaged
before
him
on
the
pavement
a
little
heap
of
matchboxes
this
creature
kept
uttering
a
meaningless
either
idiot
jabber
or
calculated
to
excite
attention
and
pity
it
sounded
something
like
pah
repeated
a
score
of
times
and
resumed
after
a
pause
hilliard
gazed
and
listened
then
placed
a
copper
in
the
wretch
extended
palm
and
turned
away
muttering
what
a
cursed
world
he
was
again
on
the
before
he
observed
that
the
full
moon
risen
into
a
sky
now
clear
of
grosser
vapours
gleamed
brilliant
silver
above
the
mean
lights
of
earth
and
round
about
it
in
so
vast
a
circumference
that
it
was
only
detected
by
the
wandering
eye
spread
a
softly
radiant
halo
this
vision
did
not
long
occupy
his
thoughts
but
at
intervals
he
again
looked
upward
to
dream
for
a
moment
on
the
silvery
splendour
and
on
that
wide
halo
athwart
the
track
of
stars
chapter
iii
instead
of
making
for
the
railway
station
to
take
a
train
back
to
dudley
he
crossed
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
extremity
of
the
town
and
by
ten
was
in
one
of
the
streets
which
lead
out
of
moseley
road
here
at
a
house
such
as
lodges
young
men
in
business
he
made
inquiry
for
narramore
and
was
forthwith
admitted
robert
narramore
a
pipe
at
his
lips
sat
by
the
fireside
on
the
table
lay
the
materials
of
a
satisfactory
supper
a
cold
fowl
a
ham
a
stilton
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
wine
hollo
you
he
exclaimed
without
rising
i
was
going
to
write
to
you
thanks
for
saving
me
the
trouble
have
something
to
eat
yes
and
to
drink
likewise
do
you
mind
ringing
the
bell
i
believe
there
a
bottle
of
burgundy
left
if
not
plenty
of
bass
he
stretched
forth
a
languid
hand
smiling
amiably
narramore
was
the
image
of
luxurious
indolence
he
had
pleasant
features
dark
hair
inclined
to
curliness
a
frame
set
off
by
good
tailoring
his
income
from
the
commercial
house
in
which
he
held
a
post
of
responsibility
would
have
permitted
him
to
occupy
better
quarters
than
these
but
here
he
had
lived
for
ten
years
and
he
preferred
a
few
inconveniences
to
the
trouble
of
moving
trouble
of
any
kind
was
robert
bugbear
his
progress
up
the
commercial
ladder
seemed
due
rather
to
the
luck
which
favours
amiable
and
young
fellows
than
to
any
special
ability
or
effort
of
his
own
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
had
a
drowsiness
which
soothed
if
it
did
not
irritate
the
listener
tell
them
to
lay
out
the
said
hilliard
when
he
had
pulled
the
bell
i
shall
stay
here
good
their
talk
was
merely
interjectional
until
the
visitor
had
begun
to
appease
his
hunger
and
had
drawn
the
cork
of
a
second
bottle
of
bitter
ale
this
is
a
great
day
hilliard
then
exclaimed
i
left
dudley
this
afternoon
feeling
ready
to
cut
my
throat
now
i
a
free
man
with
the
world
before
me
how
that
emily
going
to
take
a
second
husband
that
one
thing
heaven
be
praised
better
than
one
could
have
looked
for
hilliard
related
the
circumstances
then
he
drew
from
his
pocket
an
oblong
slip
of
paper
and
held
it
out
dengate
cried
his
friend
how
the
deuce
did
you
get
hold
of
this
explanation
followed
they
debated
dengate
character
and
motives
i
can
understand
it
said
narramore
when
i
was
a
boy
of
twelve
i
once
cheated
an
out
of
at
the
age
of
sixteen
i
encountered
the
old
woman
again
and
felt
immense
satisfaction
in
giving
her
a
shilling
but
then
you
see
i
had
done
with
petty
cheating
i
wished
to
clear
my
conscience
and
look
my
in
the
face
that
it
no
doubt
he
seems
to
have
got
some
sort
of
position
in
liverpool
society
and
he
did
like
the
thought
that
there
was
a
poor
devil
at
dudley
who
went
about
calling
him
a
scoundrel
someone
told
him
that
i
had
taken
to
liquor
and
was
on
my
way
to
destruction
generally
i
do
know
who
it
could
be
oh
we
all
have
candid
friends
that
talk
about
us
it
true
i
have
been
drunk
now
and
then
of
late
there
much
to
be
said
for
getting
drunk
much
assented
narramore
philosophically
hilliard
went
on
with
his
supper
his
friend
puffed
tobacco
and
idly
regarded
the
cheque
he
was
still
holding
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
at
length
there
came
no
reply
and
several
minutes
passed
in
silence
then
hilliard
rose
from
the
table
paced
the
floor
once
or
twice
selected
a
cigar
from
a
box
that
caught
his
eye
and
in
cutting
off
the
end
observed
quietly
i
going
to
live
wait
a
minute
we
have
the
table
cleared
and
a
kettle
on
the
fire
while
the
servant
was
busy
hilliard
stood
with
an
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
thoughtfully
smoking
his
cigar
at
narramore
request
he
mixed
two
tumblers
of
whisky
toddy
then
took
a
draught
from
his
own
and
returned
to
his
former
position
ca
you
sit
down
said
narramore
no
i
ca
what
a
fellow
you
are
with
nerves
like
yours
i
should
have
been
in
my
grave
years
ago
you
going
to
live
eh
going
to
be
a
machine
no
longer
can
i
call
myself
a
man
precious
little
difference
between
a
fellow
like
me
and
the
damned
grinding
mechanism
that
i
spend
my
days
in
drawing
that
roars
all
day
in
my
ears
and
deafens
me
i
put
an
end
to
that
here
four
hundred
pounds
it
shall
mean
four
hundred
of
life
while
this
money
lasts
i
feel
that
i
a
human
being
something
to
be
said
for
that
commented
the
listener
in
his
tone
of
drowsy
impartiality
i
offered
emily
half
of
it
she
did
want
to
take
it
and
the
man
marr
would
let
her
i
offered
to
lay
it
aside
for
the
child
but
marr
would
have
that
either
it
fairly
mine
undoubtedly
think
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
money
on
which
no
one
else
had
a
claim
when
the
poor
old
father
died
will
and
i
had
to
go
shares
in
keeping
up
the
home
our
sister
could
earn
anything
she
had
her
work
set
in
attending
to
her
mother
when
mother
died
and
marian
married
it
looked
as
if
i
had
only
myself
to
look
after
then
came
will
death
and
half
my
income
went
to
keep
his
wife
and
child
from
the
workhouse
you
know
very
well
i
never
grudged
it
it
my
faith
that
we
do
what
we
do
because
anything
else
would
be
less
agreeable
it
was
more
to
my
liking
to
live
on
a
pound
a
week
than
to
see
emily
and
the
little
lass
suffer
want
i
no
right
to
any
thanks
or
praise
for
it
but
the
change
has
come
none
too
soon
there
have
been
a
paragraph
in
the
dudley
paper
some
rainy
morning
yes
i
was
rather
afraid
of
that
said
narramore
musingly
he
let
a
minute
elapse
whilst
his
friend
paced
the
room
then
added
in
the
same
voice
we
in
luck
at
the
same
tune
my
uncle
sol
was
found
dead
this
morning
do
you
come
in
for
much
we
do
know
what
he
left
but
i
down
for
a
substantial
fraction
in
a
will
he
made
three
years
ago
nobody
knew
it
but
he
been
stark
mad
for
the
last
six
months
he
took
a
out
bordesley
way
in
a
false
name
and
stored
it
with
a
ton
or
two
of
tinned
meats
and
vegetables
there
the
landlady
found
him
lying
dead
this
morning
she
learnt
who
he
was
from
the
papers
in
his
pocket
it
come
out
that
he
had
made
friends
with
some
old
boozer
of
that
neighbourhood
he
told
him
that
england
was
on
the
point
of
a
grand
financial
smash
and
that
half
the
population
would
die
of
hunger
to
secure
himself
he
began
to
lay
in
the
stock
of
tinned
provisions
one
ca
help
laughing
poor
old
chap
that
the
result
you
see
of
a
life
spent
in
sweating
for
money
as
a
young
man
he
had
hard
times
and
when
his
invention
succeeded
it
put
him
off
balance
a
bit
i
often
thought
he
had
a
crazy
look
in
his
eye
he
may
have
thrown
away
a
lot
of
his
money
in
mad
tricks
who
knows
that
the
end
the
human
race
will
come
to
said
hilliard
it
be
driven
mad
and
killed
off
by
machinery
before
long
there
be
machines
for
washing
and
dressing
people
machines
for
feeding
them
machines
for
his
wrathful
imagination
led
him
to
grotesque
ideas
which
ended
in
laughter
well
i
have
a
year
or
two
before
me
i
know
what
enjoyment
means
and
afterwards
yes
what
afterwards
i
do
know
i
may
choose
to
come
back
i
may
prefer
to
make
an
end
impossible
to
foresee
my
state
of
mind
after
living
humanly
for
a
year
or
two
and
what
shall
do
if
you
come
in
for
a
lot
of
money
it
not
likely
to
be
more
than
a
few
thousands
replied
narramore
and
the
chances
are
i
shall
go
on
in
the
old
way
what
the
good
of
a
few
thousands
i
have
the
energy
to
go
off
and
enjoy
myself
in
your
fashion
one
of
these
days
i
may
think
of
getting
married
and
marriage
you
know
is
devilish
expensive
i
should
like
to
have
three
or
four
thousand
a
year
you
ca
start
housekeeping
on
less
if
you
not
to
be
bored
to
death
with
worries
perhaps
i
may
get
a
partnership
in
our
house
i
began
life
in
the
brass
bedstead
line
and
i
may
as
well
stick
to
brass
bedsteads
to
the
end
the
demand
likely
to
fall
off
please
fill
my
glass
again
hilliard
the
while
had
tossed
off
his
second
tumbler
he
began
to
talk
at
random
i
shall
go
to
london
first
of
all
i
may
go
abroad
reckon
a
pound

he
checked
himself
narramore
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
it
a
queer
thing
to
me
hilliard
he
remarked
when
his
friend
turned
away
that
you
kept
so
clear
of
women
now
anyone
would
think
you
were
just
the
fellow
to
get
hobbled
in
that
way
i
daresay
muttered
the
other
yes
it
a
queer
thing
i
have
been
saved
i
suppose
by
the
necessity
of
supporting
my
relatives
i
seen
so
much
of
women
suffering
from
poverty
that
it
has
got
me
into
the
habit
of
thinking
of
them
as
nothing
but
burdens
to
a
man
as
they
nearly
always
are
yes
nearly
always
narramore
pondered
with
his
amiable
smile
the
other
after
a
gloom
shook
himself
free
again
and
talked
with
growing
exhilaration
of
the
new
life
that
had
dawned
before
him
chapter
iv
hilliard
lodgings
they
were
represented
by
a
single
room
commanded
a
prospect
which
to
him
a
weariness
and
a
disgust
would
have
seemed
impressive
enough
to
eyes
beholding
it
for
the
first
time
on
the
afternoon
of
his
last
day
at
dudley
he
stood
by
the
window
and
looked
forth
congratulating
himself
with
a
fierceness
of
emotion
which
defied
misgiving
that
he
would
gaze
no
more
on
this
scene
of
his
servitude
the
house
was
one
of
a
row
situated
on
a
terrace
above
a
muddy
declivity
marked
with
footpaths
it
looked
over
a
wide
expanse
of
waste
ground
covered
in
places
with
coarse
herbage
but
for
the
most
part
undulating
in
bare
tracts
of
slag
and
cinder
opposite
some
quarter
of
a
mile
away
rose
a
lofty
hill
from
base
to
summit
and
rearing
above
the
bare
branches
of
its
topmost
trees
the
ruined
keep
of
dudley
castle
along
the
foot
of
this
hill
ran
the
highway
which
descends
from
dudley
town
hidden
by
rising
ground
on
the
left
to
the
there
beyond
the
eye
traversed
a
great
plain
its
limit
the
blending
of
earth
and
sky
in
lurid
cloud
a
ray
of
yellow
sunset
touched
the
height
and
its
crowning
ruin
at
the
zenith
shone
a
space
of
pure
pale
blue
save
for
these
points
of
relief
the
picture
was
colourless
and
uniformly
sombre
far
and
near
innumerable
chimneys
sent
forth
fumes
of
various
density
jets
of
steam
coldly
white
against
the
murky
distance
wan
smoke
from
wafted
in
long
trails
reek
of
solid
blackness
from
pits
and
forges
voluming
aloft
and
by
the
sluggish
wind
born
at
birmingham
the
son
of
a
teacher
of
drawing
maurice
hilliard
had
spent
most
of
his
life
in
the
midland
capital
to
its
grammar
school
he
owed
an
education
just
sufficiently
prolonged
to
unfit
him
for
the
tasks
of
an
underling
yet
not
thorough
enough
to
qualify
him
for
professional
life
in
boyhood
he
aspired
to
the
career
of
an
artist
but
his
father
himself
the
wreck
of
a
painter
rudely
discouraged
this
ambition
by
way
of
compromise
between
the
craft
and
the
beggarly
art
he
became
a
of
late
years
he
had
developed
a
strong
taste
for
the
study
of
architecture
much
of
his
leisure
was
given
to
this
subject
and
what
money
he
could
spare
went
in
the
purchase
of
books
and
prints
which
helped
him
to
extend
his
architectural
knowledge
in
moods
of
hope
he
had
asked
himself
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
to
escape
from
bondage
to
the
gods
of
iron
and
earn
a
living
in
an
architect
office
that
desire
was
now
forgotten
in
his
passionate
resolve
to
enjoy
liberty
without
regard
for
the
future
all
his
possessions
save
the
articles
of
clothing
which
he
would
carry
with
him
were
packed
in
a
couple
of
trunks
to
be
sent
on
the
morrow
to
birmingham
where
they
would
lie
in
the
care
of
his
friend
narramore
kinsfolk
he
had
none
whom
he
cared
to
remember
except
his
sister
she
lived
at
wolverhampton
a
wife
and
mother
in
narrow
but
not
oppressive
circumstances
and
hilliard
had
taken
leave
of
her
in
a
short
visit
some
days
ago
he
would
not
wait
for
the
wedding
of
his
enough
that
she
was
provided
for
and
that
his
conscience
would
always
be
at
ease
on
her
account
for
he
was
troubled
with
a
conscience
even
with
one
unusually
poignant
an
anecdote
from
his
twentieth
year
depicts
this
feature
of
the
man
he
and
narramore
were
walking
one
night
in
a
very
poor
part
of
birmingham
and
for
some
reason
they
chanced
to
pause
by
a
a
small
window
lighted
with
one
and
laid
out
with
a
miserable
handful
of
paltry
wares
the
shop
however
was
newly
opened
and
showed
a
pathetic
attempt
at
cleanliness
and
neatness
the
friends
asked
each
other
how
it
could
possibly
benefit
anyone
to
embark
in
such
a
business
as
that
and
laughed
over
the
display
while
he
was
laughing
hilliard
became
aware
of
a
woman
in
the
doorway
evidently
the
shopkeeper
she
had
heard
their
remarks
and
looked
distressed
infinitely
keener
was
the
pang
which
maurice
experienced
he
could
not
forgive
himself
kept
exclaiming
how
brutally
he
had
behaved
and
sank
into
gloominess
not
very
long
after
he
took
narramore
to
walk
in
the
same
direction
they
came
again
to
the
little
shop
and
hilliard
surprised
his
companion
with
a
triumphant
shout
the
window
was
now
laid
out
in
a
much
more
promising
way
with
goods
of
modest
value
you
remember
said
the
young
man
i
could
rest
till
i
had
sent
her
something
she
wonder
to
the
end
of
her
life
who
the
money
came
from
but
she
made
use
of
it
poor
creature
and
it
bring
her
luck
only
the
hopeless
suppression
of
natural
desires
the
conflict
through
years
of
ardent
youth
with
sordid
circumstances
could
have
brought
him
to
the
pass
he
had
now
reached
one
of
desperation
centred
in
self
every
suggestion
of
native
suavity
and
prudence
was
swept
away
in
tumultuous
revolt
another
twelvemonth
of
his
slavery
and
he
would
have
yielded
to
brutalising
influences
which
rarely
relax
their
hold
upon
a
man
he
was
prompted
by
the
instinct
of
flight
from
peril
threatening
all
that
was
worthy
in
him
just
as
the
last
glimmer
of
daylight
vanished
from
his
room
there
sounded
a
knock
at
the
door
your
tea
ready
hilliard
called
a
woman
voice
he
took
his
meals
downstairs
in
the
landlady
parlour
appetite
at
present
lie
had
none
but
the
pretence
of
eating
was
a
way
of
passing
the
time
so
he
descended
and
sat
down
at
the
prepared
table
his
wandering
eyes
fell
on
one
of
the
ornaments
of
the
room
mrs
brewer
album
on
first
coming
to
live
in
the
house
two
years
ago
he
had
examined
this
collection
of
domestic
portraits
and
subsequently
from
time
to
time
had
taken
up
the
album
to
look
at
one
photograph
which
interested
him
among
an
assemblage
of
types
excelling
in
ugliness
of
feature
and
hideousness
of
costume
types
of
age
of
ungainly
middle
life
and
of
youth
lacking
every
grace
such
as
are
exhibited
in
the
albums
of
the
poor
there
was
discoverable
one
female
portrait
in
which
the
longer
he
gazed
at
it
hilliard
found
an
suggestiveness
of
those
qualities
he
desired
in
woman
unclasping
the
volume
he
opened
immediately
at
this
familiar
face
a
month
or
two
had
elapsed
since
he
last
regarded
it
and
the
countenance
took
possession
of
him
with
the
same
force
as
ever
it
was
that
of
a
young
woman
probably
past
her
twentieth
year
unlike
her
neighbours
in
the
album
she
had
not
bedizened
herself
before
sitting
to
be
portrayed
the
abundant
hair
was
parted
simply
and
smoothly
from
her
forehead
and
tightly
plaited
behind
she
wore
a
linen
collar
and
so
far
as
could
be
judged
from
the
portion
included
in
the
picture
a
homely
cloth
gown
her
features
were
comely
and
intelligent
and
exhibited
a
gentleness
almost
a
meekness
of
expression
which
was
as
far
as
possible
from
seeming
affected
whether
she
smiled
or
looked
sad
hilliard
had
striven
vainly
to
determine
her
lips
appeared
to
smile
but
in
so
slight
a
degree
that
perchance
it
was
merely
an
effect
of
natural
line
whereas
if
the
mouth
were
concealed
a
profound
melancholy
at
once
ruled
the
visage
who
she
was
hilliard
had
no
idea
more
than
once
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
asking
his
landlady
but
characteristic
delicacies
restrained
him
he
feared
mrs
brewer
mental
comment
and
dreaded
the
possible
disclosure
that
he
had
admired
a
housemaid
or
someone
of
yet
lower
condition
nor
could
he
trust
his
judgment
of
the
face
perhaps
it
shone
only
by
contrast
with
so
much
ugliness
on
either
side
of
it
perhaps
in
the
starved
condition
of
his
senses
he
was
ready
to
find
perfection
in
any
female
countenance
not
frankly
repulsive
yet
no
it
was
a
beautiful
face
beautiful
at
all
events
in
the
sense
of
being
deeply
interesting
in
the
strength
of
its
appeal
to
his
emotions
another
man
might
pass
it
slightingly
to
him
it
spoke
as
no
other
face
had
ever
spoken
it
awakened
in
him
a
consciousness
of
profound
sympathy
while
he
still
sat
at
table
his
landlady
came
in
she
was
a
worthy
woman
of
her
class
not
given
to
vulgar
gossip
her
purpose
in
entering
the
room
at
this
moment
was
to
ask
hilliard
whether
he
had
a
likeness
of
himself
which
he
could
spare
her
as
a
memento
i
sorry
i
do
possess
such
a
thing
he
answered
laughing
surprised
that
the
woman
should
care
enough
about
him
to
make
the
request
but
talking
of
photographs
would
you
tell
me
who
this
is
the
album
lay
beside
him
and
a
feeling
of
embarrassment
as
he
saw
mrs
brewer
look
rest
upon
it
impelled
him
to
the
decisive
question
that
oh
that
a
friend
of
my
daughter
martha
eve
madeley
sure
i
do
wonder
at
you
noticing
her
but
it
does
do
her
justice
she
better
looking
than
that
it
was
took
better
than
two
years
ago
why
just
before
you
came
to
me
hilliard
she
was
going
away
to
london
eve
madeley
he
repeated
the
name
to
himself
and
liked
it
she
had
a
deal
of
trouble
poor
thing
pursued
the
landlady
we
was
sorry
to
lose
sight
of
her
but
glad
i
sure
that
she
went
away
to
do
better
for
herself
she
has
been
home
since
then
and
we
hear
of
her
coming
and
i
sure
nobody
can
be
surprised
but
our
martha
heard
from
her
not
so
long
ago
why
it
was
about
is
she
he
was
about
to
add
in
service
but
could
not
voice
the
words
she
has
an
engagement
in
london
yes
she
a
bookkeeper
and
earns
her
pound
a
week
she
was
always
clever
at
figures
she
got
on
so
well
at
the
school
that
they
wanted
her
to
be
a
teacher
but
she
did
like
it
then
reckitt
the
ironmonger
a
friend
of
her
father
got
her
to
help
him
with
his
books
and
bills
of
an
evening
and
when
she
was
seventeen
because
his
business
was
growing
and
he
had
much
of
a
head
for
figures
himself
he
took
her
regular
into
the
shop
and
glad
she
was
to
give
up
the
for
she
could
never
abear
it
you
say
she
had
a
lot
of
trouble
ah
that
indeed
she
had
and
all
her
father
fault
but
for
him
foolish
man
they
might
have
been
a
family
but
he
had
to
suffer
for
it
himself
too
he
lives
up
here
on
the
hill
in
a
poor
cottage
and
takes
wages
as
a
timekeeper
at
robinson
when
he
ought
to
have
been
paying
men
of
his
own
the
drink
that
what
it
was
when
our
martha
first
knew
them
they
were
living
at
walsall
and
if
it
had
a
been
for
eve
they
have
had
no
home
at
all
martha
got
to
know
her
at
the
eve
used
to
teach
a
class
that
seven
or
eight
years
ago
she
was
only
a
girl
of
sixteen
but
she
had
the
ways
of
a
woman
and
very
lucky
it
was
for
them
belonging
to
her
often
and
often
they
gone
for
days
with
nothing
but
a
dry
loaf
and
the
father
spending
all
he
got
at
the
public
was
it
a
large
family
hilliard
inquired
well
let
me
see
at
that
time
there
was
eve
two
sisters
and
her
brother
two
other
children
had
died
and
the
mother
was
dead
too
i
do
know
much
about
but
they
say
she
was
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
and
it
likely
the
eldest
girl
took
after
her
a
quieter
and
modester
girl
than
eve
there
never
was
our
martha
lived
with
her
aunt
at
walsall
that
my
only
sister
and
she
was
poor
thing
and
had
martha
to
look
after
her
and
when
she
died
and
martha
came
back
here
to
us
the
madeley
family
came
here
as
well
the
father
got
some
kind
of
work
but
he
could
keep
it
and
he
went
off
i
know
where
and
eve
had
the
children
to
keep
and
look
after
we
used
to
do
what
we
could
to
help
her
but
it
was
a
cruel
life
for
a
poor
thing
of
her
age
just
when
she
ought
to
have
been
enjoying
her
life
as
you
may
say
hilliard
interest
waxed
then
pursued
mrs
brewer
the
next
sister
to
eve
laura
her
name
was
went
to
birmingham
into
a
sweetstuff
shop
and
that
was
the
last
ever
seen
or
heard
of
her
she
was
a
girl
to
be
depended
upon
and
i
never
thought
she
come
to
good
and
whether
she
alive
or
dead
there
no
knowing
eve
took
it
to
heart
that
she
did
and
not
six
months
after
the
other
girl
had
the
and
she
died
and
just
as
they
was
carrying
her
coffin
out
of
the
house
who
should
come
up
but
her
father
he
been
away
for
nearly
two
years
just
sending
a
little
money
now
and
then
and
he
did
even
know
the
girl
had
been
ailing
and
when
he
saw
the
coffin
it
took
him
so
that
he
fell
down
just
like
a
dead
man
you
would
have
thought
it
but
there
no
knowing
what
goes
on
in
people
minds
well
if
you
believe
it
from
that
day
he
was
so
changed
we
did
seem
to
know
him
he
turned
quite
religious
and
went
regular
to
chapel
and
has
done
ever
since
and
he
would
touch
a
drop
of
anything
tempt
him
who
might
it
was
a
case
of
conversion
if
ever
there
was
one
so
there
remained
only
eve
and
her
brother
yes
he
was
a
steady
lad
tom
madeley
and
never
gave
his
sister
much
trouble
he
earns
his
thirty
shillings
a
week
now
well
and
soon
after
she
saw
her
father
going
on
all
right
eve
left
home
i
do
wonder
at
it
it
was
to
be
expected
she
could
forgive
him
for
all
the
harm
and
sorrows
he
caused
she
went
to
birmingham
for
a
few
months
and
then
she
came
back
one
day
to
tell
us
she
got
a
place
in
london
and
she
brought
that
photo
to
give
us
to
remember
her
by
but
as
i
said
it
is
good
enough
does
she
seem
to
be
happier
now
she
has
wrote
more
than
once
or
twice
but
she
doing
well
and
whatever
happens
she
not
the
one
to
complain
it
a
blessing
always
had
her
health
no
doubt
she
made
friends
in
london
but
we
have
heard
about
them
martha
was
hoping
she
have
come
for
christmas
but
it
seems
she
could
get
away
for
long
enough
from
business
i
tell
you
her
address
but
i
do
remember
it
i
never
been
in
london
myself
martha
knows
it
of
course
she
might
look
in
and
if
she
does
i
ask
her
hilliard
allowed
this
suggestion
to
pass
without
remark
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
desired
to
know
miss
madeley
address
but
later
in
the
evening
when
after
walking
for
two
or
three
hours
about
the
cold
dark
roads
he
came
in
to
have
his
supper
and
go
to
bed
mrs
brewer
smilingly
offered
him
a
scrap
of
paper
there
she
said
that
where
she
living
london
a
big
place
and
you
may
be
anywhere
near
but
if
you
happened
to
walk
that
way
we
should
take
it
kindly
if
you
just
leave
word
that
we
always
glad
to
hear
from
her
and
hope
she
well
with
a
mixture
of
reluctance
and
satisfaction
the
young
man
took
the
paper
glanced
at
it
and
folded
it
to
put
in
his
pocket
mrs
brewer
was
regarding
him
and
he
felt
that
his
silence
must
seem
ungracious
i
will
certainly
call
and
leave
your
message
he
said
up
in
his
lie
sat
for
a
long
time
with
the
paper
lying
open
before
him
and
when
he
slept
his
rest
was
troubled
with
dreams
of
an
anxious
search
about
the
highways
and
byways
of
london
for
that
face
which
had
so
wrought
upon
his
imagination
long
before
daylight
he
awoke
at
the
sound
of
bells
and
hootings
and
whistlings
which
summoned
the
dudley
workfolk
to
their
labour
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
heard
these
hideous
noises
with
pleasure
they
told
him
that
the
day
of
his
escape
had
come
unable
to
lie
still
he
rose
at
once
and
went
out
into
the
chill
dawn
thoughts
of
eve
madeley
no
longer
possessed
him
a
glorious
sense
of
freedom
excluded
every
recollection
of
his
past
life
and
he
wandered
aimlessly
with
a
song
in
his
heart
at
breakfast
the
sight
of
mrs
brewer
album
tempted
him
to
look
once
more
at
the
portrait
but
he
did
not
yield
shall
we
ever
see
you
again
i
wonder
asked
his
landlady
when
the
moment
arrived
for
if
i
am
ever
again
in
dudley
i
shall
come
here
he
answered
kindly
but
on
his
way
to
the
station
he
felt
a
joyful
assurance
that
fate
would
have
no
power
to
draw
him
back
again
into
this
circle
of
fiery
torments
chapter
v
two
months
later
on
a
brilliant
morning
of
may
hilliard
again
awoke
from
troubled
dreams
but
the
sounds
about
him
had
no
association
with
bygone
miseries
from
the
courtyard
upon
which
his
window
looked
there
came
a
ringing
of
gay
laughter
followed
by
shrill
merry
gossip
in
a
foreign
tongue
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
a
church
bell
was
pealing
presently
footsteps
hurried
along
the
corridor
and
an
impatient
voice
shouted
repeatedly
alphonse
alphonse
he
was
in
paris
had
been
there
for
six
weeks
and
now
awoke
with
a
sense
of
loneliness
a
desire
to
be
back
among
his
own
people
in
london
he
had
spent
only
a
fortnight
it
was
not
a
time
that
he
cared
to
reflect
upon
no
sooner
had
he
found
himself
in
the
metropolis
alone
and
free
with
a
pocketful
of
money
than
a
delirium
possessed
him
every
resolution
notwithstanding
he
yielded
to
grossest
lures
all
he
could
remember
was
a
succession
of
extravagances
beneath
a
sunless
sky
with
chance
companions
whose
faces
he
had
forgotten
five
minutes
after
parting
with
them
sovereign
after
sovereign
melted
out
of
his
hand
the
end
of
the
second
week
found
his
capital
diminished
by
some
pounds
in
an
hour
of
physical
and
moral
nausea
he
packed
his
journeyed
to
newhaven
and
as
a
sort
of
penance
crossed
the
channel
by
passage
arrived
in
paris
he
felt
himself
secure
and
soon
recovered
sanity
thanks
to
his
studious
habits
he
was
equipped
with
now
both
for
economy
sake
and
for
his
mental
advantage
he
struggled
with
the
spoken
language
and
so
far
succeeded
as
to
lodge
very
cheaply
in
a
rather
disreputable
hotel
and
to
eat
at
restaurants
where
dinner
of
several
courses
cost
two
francs
and
a
half
his
life
was
irreproachable
he
studied
the
paris
of
art
and
history
but
perforce
he
remained
companionless
and
solitude
had
begun
to
weigh
upon
him
this
morning
whilst
he
sat
over
his
bowl
of
coffee
and
a
certain
recollection
haunted
him
persistently
yesterday
in
turning
out
his
pockets
he
had
come
upon
a
scrap
of
paper
whereon
was
written
belmont
street
chalk
farm
road
london
this
formula
it
was
which
now
kept
running
through
his
mind
like
a
refrain
which
will
not
be
dismissed
he
reproached
himself
for
neglect
of
his
promise
to
mrs
brewer
more
than
that
he
charged
himself
with
foolish
disregard
of
a
possibility
which
might
have
boundless
significance
for
him
here
it
seemed
was
sufficient
motive
for
a
return
to
london
the
alternative
was
to
wander
on
and
see
more
of
foreign
countries
a
tempting
suggestion
but
marred
by
the
prospect
of
loneliness
he
would
go
back
among
his
own
people
and
make
friends
without
comradeship
liberty
had
little
savour
still
travelling
with
as
small
expense
as
might
be
he
reached
london
in
the
forenoon
left
his
luggage
at
victoria
station
and
after
a
meal
betook
himself
in
the
northerly
direction
it
was
a
rainy
and
uncomfortable
day
but
this
did
not
much
affect
his
spirits
he
felt
like
a
man
new
risen
from
illness
seemed
to
have
cast
off
something
that
had
threatened
his
very
existence
and
marvelled
at
the
state
of
mind
in
which
it
had
been
possible
for
him
to
inhabit
london
without
turning
his
steps
towards
the
address
of
eve
madeley
he
discovered
belmont
street
it
consisted
of
humble
houses
and
was
dreary
enough
to
look
upon
as
he
sought
for
no
a
sudden
nervousness
attacked
him
he
became
conscious
all
at
once
of
the
strangeness
of
his
position
at
this
hour
it
was
unlikely
that
eve
would
be
at
home
an
inquiry
at
the
house
and
the
leaving
of
a
verbal
message
would
discharge
his
obligation
but
he
proposed
more
than
that
it
was
his
resolve
to
see
eve
herself
to
behold
the
face
which
in
a
picture
had
grown
so
familiar
to
him
yet
till
this
moment
he
had
overlooked
the
difficulties
of
the
enterprise
could
he
on
the
strength
of
an
acquaintance
with
mrs
brewer
claim
the
friendly
regards
of
this
girl
who
had
never
heard
his
name
if
he
saw
her
once
on
what
pretext
could
he
seek
for
a
second
meeting
possibly
he
would
not
desire
it
eve
in
her
own
person
might
disenchant
him
meanwhile
he
had
discovered
the
house
and
without
further
debate
he
knocked
the
door
was
opened
by
a
woman
of
ordinary
type
slatternly
and
with
suspicious
eye
miss
madeley
live
here
she
said
but
she
been
gone
a
month
or
more
can
you
tell
me
where
she
is
living
now
after
a
searching
look
the
woman
replied
that
she
could
not
in
the
manner
of
her
kind
she
was
anxious
to
dismiss
the
inquirer
and
get
the
door
shut
gravely
disappointed
hilliard
felt
unable
to
turn
away
without
a
further
question
perhaps
you
know
where
she
is
or
was
employed
but
no
information
whatever
was
forthcoming
it
very
rarely
is
under
such
circumstances
for
a
london
landlady
compounded
in
general
of
craft
and
caution
tends
naturally
to
reticence
on
the
score
of
her
former
lodgers
if
she
has
parted
with
them
on
amicable
terms
her
instinct
is
to
shield
them
against
the
menace
presumed
in
every
inquiry
if
her
mood
is
one
of
she
refuses
information
lest
the
departed
should
reap
advantage
and
then
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
she
has
really
no
information
to
give
the
door
closed
with
that
severity
of
exclusion
in
which
london
doors
excel
and
hilliard
turned
despondently
away
he
was
just
consoling
himself
with
the
thought
that
eve
would
probably
before
long
communicate
her
new
address
to
the
friends
at
dudley
and
by
that
means
he
might
hear
of
it
when
a
little
girl
who
had
stood
within
earshot
while
he
was
talking
and
who
had
followed
him
to
the
end
of
the
street
approached
him
with
an
abrupt
inquiry
was
you
asking
for
miss
madeley
sir
yes
i
was
do
you
know
anything
of
her
my
mother
did
washing
for
her
and
when
she
moved
i
had
to
take
some
things
of
hers
to
the
new
address
then
you
remember
it
it
a
goodish
way
from
sir
shall
i
go
with
you
hilliard
understood
like
the
good
samaritan
of
old
he
took
out
twopence
the
face
of
the
dirty
little
girl
brightened
wonderfully
tell
me
the
address
that
will
be
enough
do
you
know
gower
place
sir
somewhere
near
gower
street
i
suppose
his
supposition
was
confirmed
and
he
learnt
the
number
of
the
house
to
which
miss
madeley
had
transferred
herself
in
that
direction
he
at
once
bent
his
steps
gower
place
is
in
the
close
neighbourhood
of
euston
road
hilliard
remembered
that
he
had
passed
the
end
of
it
on
his
first
arrival
in
london
when
he
set
forth
from
euston
station
to
look
for
a
lodging
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
he
had
not
turned
into
this
very
street
instead
of
going
further
several
windows
displayed
on
the
whole
it
looked
a
better
locality
than
belmont
street
eve
removal
hither
might
signify
an
improvement
of
circumstances
the
house
which
he
sought
had
a
clean
doorstep
and
unusually
bright
windows
his
knock
was
answered
quickly
and
by
a
young
sprightly
woman
who
smiled
upon
him
i
believe
miss
madeley
lives
here
yes
she
does
she
is
not
at
home
just
now
no
she
went
out
after
breakfast
and
i
sure
i
ca
say
when
be
back
hilliard
felt
a
slight
wonder
at
this
uncertainty
the
young
woman
observing
his
expression
added
with
vivacious
friendliness
do
you
want
to
see
her
on
business
no
a
private
matter
this
occasioned
a
smirk
well
she
has
any
regular
hours
at
present
sometimes
she
comes
to
dinner
sometimes
she
does
sometimes
she
comes
to
tea
but
just
as
often
she
is
till
late
you
like
to
leave
your
name
i
think
i
call
again
did
you
expect
to
find
her
at
now
asked
the
young
woman
whose
curiosity
grew
more
eager
as
she
watched
hilliard
countenance
perhaps
he
replied
neglecting
the
question
i
should
find
her
here
morning
well
i
can
say
as
someone
going
to
call
you
know
please
do
so
therewith
he
turned
away
anxious
to
escape
a
volley
of
interrogation
for
which
the
landlady
tongue
was
primed
he
walked
into
gower
street
and
pondered
the
awkward
interview
that
now
lay
before
him
on
his
calling
miss
madeley
would
doubtless
come
to
speak
with
him
at
the
door
even
supposing
she
had
a
parlour
at
her
disposal
she
was
not
likely
to
invite
a
perfect
stranger
into
the
house
how
could
he
make
her
acquaintance
on
the
doorstep
to
be
sure
he
brought
a
message
but
this
commission
had
been
so
long
delayed
that
he
felt
some
shame
about
discharging
it
in
any
case
his
delivery
of
the
message
would
sound
odd
there
would
be
embarrassment
on
both
sides
why
was
eve
so
uncertain
in
her
comings
and
goings
necessity
of
business
perhaps
yet
he
had
expected
quite
the
opposite
state
of
things
from
mrs
brewer
description
of
the
girl
character
he
had
imagined
her
leading
a
life
of
clockwork
regularity
the
point
was
very
trivial
but
it
somehow
caused
a
disturbance
of
his
thoughts
which
tended
to
misgiving
in
the
meantime
he
had
to
find
quarters
for
himself
why
not
seek
them
in
gower
place
after
ten
minutes
sauntering
he
retraced
his
steps
and
walked
down
the
side
of
the
street
opposite
to
that
on
which
eve
lodgings
were
situated
nearly
over
against
that
particular
house
was
a
window
with
a
card
carelessly
he
approached
the
door
and
carelessly
asked
to
see
the
rooms
that
were
to
let
they
were
comfortless
but
would
suit
his
purpose
for
a
time
he
engaged
a
on
the
and
a
above
and
went
to
fetch
his
luggage
from
victoria
station
on
the
steamer
last
night
he
had
not
slept
and
now
that
he
was
once
more
housed
an
overpowering
fatigue
constrained
him
to
lie
down
and
close
his
eyes
almost
immediately
lie
fell
into
oblivion
and
lay
sleeping
on
the
cranky
sofa
until
the
entrance
of
a
girl
with
awakened
him
from
his
parlour
window
he
could
very
well
observe
the
houses
opposite
without
fear
of
drawing
attention
from
any
one
on
that
side
and
so
it
happened
that
without
deliberate
purpose
of
espial
he
watched
the
door
of
eve
madeley
residence
for
a
long
time
till
in
fact
he
grew
weary
of
the
occupation
no
one
had
entered
no
one
had
come
forth
at
seven
he
took
his
hat
and
left
the
house
scarcely
had
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
when
he
became
aware
that
a
lightly
tripping
and
rather
showily
dressed
girl
who
was
coming
down
the
other
side
of
the
way
had
turned
off
the
pavement
and
was
plying
the
knocker
at
the
house
which
interested
him
he
gazed
eagerly
impossible
that
a
young
person
of
that
garb
and
deportment
should
be
eve
madeley
her
face
was
hidden
from
him
and
at
this
distance
he
could
not
have
recognised
the
features
even
presuming
that
his
familiarity
with
the
portrait
taken
more
than
two
years
ago
would
enable
him
to
identify
eve
when
he
saw
her
the
door
opened
the
girl
was
admitted
afraid
of
being
noticed
he
walked
on
the
distance
to
the
head
of
the
street
was
not
more
than
thirty
yards
there
lay
gower
street
on
the
right
hand
the
metropolitan
station
to
the
left
a
long
perspective
southwards
delaying
in
doubt
as
to
his
course
hilliard
glanced
back
from
the
house
which
attracted
his
eyes
he
saw
come
forth
the
girl
who
had
recently
entered
and
close
following
her
another
young
woman
they
began
to
walk
sharply
towards
where
he
stood
he
did
not
stir
and
the
couple
drew
so
near
that
he
could
observe
their
faces
in
the
second
girl
he
recognised
or
believed
that
he
recognised
eve
madeley
she
wore
a
costume
in
decidedly
better
taste
than
her
companion
for
all
that
her
appearance
struck
him
as
quite
unlike
that
he
would
have
expected
eve
madeley
to
present
he
had
thought
of
her
as
very
plainly
perhaps
poorly
clad
but
this
attire
was
ornate
and
looked
rather
expensive
it
might
be
in
the
mode
of
the
new
season
in
figure
she
was
altogether
a
more
imposing
young
woman
than
he
had
pictured
to
himself
his
pulses
were
sensibly
quickened
as
he
looked
at
her
the
examination
was
of
necessity
hurried
walking
at
a
sharp
pace
they
rapidly
came
close
to
where
he
stood
he
drew
aside
to
let
them
pass
and
at
that
moment
caught
a
few
words
of
their
conversation
i
told
you
we
should
be
late
exclaimed
the
unknown
girl
in
friendly
remonstrance
what
does
it
matter
replied
eve
if
eve
it
were
i
hate
standing
at
the
doors
we
shall
find
seats
somewhere
her
gay
careless
tones
astonished
the
listener
involuntarily
he
began
to
follow
but
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
in
gower
street
they
stopped
and
by
advancing
another
step
or
two
he
distinctly
overheard
the
continuation
of
their
talk
the
will
take
a
long
time
bother
the
this
was
eve
madeley
again
if
eve
it
could
really
be
we
have
a
cab
look
there
a
crawler
in
euston
road
stopped
him
i
say
eve
you
going
it
this
exclamation
from
the
other
girl
was
the
last
sentence
that
fell
on
hilliard
ear
they
both
tripped
off
towards
the
cab
which
gesture
had
summoned
he
saw
them
jump
in
and
drive
away
i
say
eve
you
going
it
why
there
his
doubt
was
settled
the
name
confirmed
him
in
his
identification
but
he
stood
motionless
with
astonishment
they
were
going
to
a
theatre
of
course
and
eve
spoke
as
if
money
were
of
no
consequence
to
her
she
had
the
look
the
tones
of
one
bent
on
enjoying
herself
of
one
who
habitually
pursued
pleasure
and
that
in
its
most
urban
forms
her
companion
had
a
voice
of
thinner
quality
of
higher
note
which
proclaimed
a
subordinate
character
it
sounded
moreover
with
the
london
accent
while
eve
struck
a
more
familiar
note
to
the
man
of
the
midlands
eve
seemed
to
be
the
elder
of
the
two
it
could
not
be
thought
for
a
moment
that
her
will
was
guided
by
that
of
the
more
trivial
girl
eve
madeley
the
meek
the
melancholy
the
the
pious
what
did
it
all
mean
utterly
bewildered
the
young
man
walked
on
without
thought
of
direction
and
rambled
dreamily
about
the
streets
for
an
hour
or
two
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
not
to
fulfil
the
promise
of
calling
to
see
miss
madeley
morning
at
one
moment
he
regretted
having
taken
lodgings
in
gower
place
at
another
he
determined
to
make
use
of
his
advantage
and
play
the
spy
upon
movements
without
scruple
the
interest
she
had
hitherto
excited
in
him
was
faint
indeed
compared
with
emotions
such
as
this
first
glimpse
of
her
had
kindled
and
fanned
a
sense
of
peril
warned
him
to
hold
aloof
tumult
of
his
senses
rendered
the
warning
useless
at
eleven
he
was
sitting
by
his
bedroom
window
in
darkness
watching
the
house
across
the
way
chapter
vi
it
was
just
upon
midnight
when
eve
returned
she
came
at
a
quick
walk
and
alone
the
light
of
the
showed
her
figure
distinctly
enough
to
leave
the
watcher
in
no
doubt
a
latchkey
admitted
her
to
the
house
presently
there
appeared
a
light
at
an
upper
window
and
a
shadow
kept
moving
across
the
blind
when
the
light
was
extinguished
hilliard
went
to
bed
but
that
night
he
slept
little
the
next
morning
passed
in
restless
debate
with
himself
he
did
not
cross
the
way
to
call
upon
eve
the
thought
of
speaking
with
her
on
the
doorstep
of
a
proved
intolerable
all
day
long
he
kept
his
post
of
observation
other
persons
he
saw
leave
and
enter
the
house
but
miss
madeley
did
not
come
forth
that
he
could
have
missed
her
seemed
impossible
for
even
while
eating
his
meals
he
remained
by
the
window
perchance
she
had
left
home
very
early
in
the
morning
but
it
was
unlikely
through
the
afternoon
it
rained
the
gloomy
sky
intensified
his
fatigue
and
despondence
about
six
exhausted
in
mind
and
body
he
had
allowed
his
attention
to
stray
when
the
sudden
clang
of
a
street
organ
startled
him
his
eyes
turned
in
the
wonted
direction
and
instantly
he
sprang
up
to
clutch
his
hat
to
rush
from
the
room
and
from
the
house
occupied
but
a
moment
there
walking
away
on
the
other
side
was
eve
her
mantle
her
hat
with
the
yellow
flowers
were
the
same
as
yesterday
the
rain
had
ceased
in
the
western
sky
appeared
promise
of
a
fair
evening
hilliard
pursued
her
in
a
parallel
line
at
the
top
of
the
street
she
crossed
towards
him
he
let
her
pass
by
and
followed
closely
she
entered
the
of
gower
street
station
he
drew
as
near
as
possible
and
heard
her
ask
for
a
ticket
healtheries
third
return
the
slang
term
for
the
health
exhibition
at
kensington
was
familiar
to
him
from
the
english
papers
he
had
seen
in
paris
as
soon
as
eve
had
passed
on
he
obtained
a
like
ticket
and
hastened
down
the
steps
in
pursuit
a
minute
or
two
and
he
was
sitting
face
to
face
with
her
in
the
railway
carriage
he
could
now
observe
her
at
his
leisure
and
compare
her
features
with
those
represented
in
the
photograph
mrs
brewer
had
said
truly
that
the
portrait
did
not
do
her
justice
he
saw
the
resemblance
yet
what
a
difference
between
the
face
he
had
brooded
over
at
dudley
and
that
which
lived
before
him
a
difference
not
to
be
accounted
for
by
mere
lapse
of
time
she
could
not
he
thought
have
changed
greatly
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
for
her
age
at
the
time
of
sitting
for
the
photograph
must
have
been
at
least
she
did
not
look
older
than
he
had
expected
it
was
still
a
young
face
but
and
herein
he
found
its
strangeness
that
of
a
woman
who
views
life
without
embarrassment
without
anxiety
she
sat
at
her
ease
casting
careless
glances
this
way
and
that
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
he
winced
yet
she
paid
no
more
heed
to
him
than
to
the
other
passengers
presently
she
became
lost
in
thought
her
eyes
fell
ah
now
the
resemblance
to
the
portrait
came
out
more
distinctly
her
lips
shaped
themselves
to
that
expression
which
he
knew
so
well
the
telling
of
habitual
sadness
his
fixed
gaze
recalled
her
to
herself
and
immediately
the
countenance
changed
beyond
recognition
her
eyes
wandered
past
him
with
a
look
of
cold
if
not
defiant
reserve
the
lips
lost
all
their
sweetness
he
was
chilled
with
vague
distrust
and
once
again
asked
himself
whether
this
could
be
the
eve
madeley
whose
history
he
had
heard
again
she
fell
into
abstraction
and
some
trouble
seemed
to
grow
upon
her
mind
it
was
difficult
now
to
identify
her
with
the
girl
who
had
talked
and
laughed
so
gaily
last
evening
towards
the
end
of
the
journey
a
nervous
restlessness
began
to
appear
in
her
looks
and
movements
hilliard
felt
that
he
had
annoyed
her
by
the
persistency
of
his
observation
and
tried
to
keep
his
eyes
averted
but
no
the
disturbance
she
betrayed
was
due
to
some
other
cause
probably
she
paid
not
the
least
regard
to
him
at
earl
court
she
alighted
hurriedly
by
this
time
hilliard
had
begun
to
feel
shame
in
the
ignoble
part
he
was
playing
but
choice
he
had
none
the
girl
drew
him
irresistibly
to
follow
and
watch
her
among
the
crowd
entering
the
exhibition
he
could
easily
keep
her
in
sight
without
risk
of
his
espial
being
detected
that
eve
had
come
to
keep
an
appointment
with
some
acquaintance
he
felt
sure
and
at
any
cost
he
must
discover
who
the
person
was
the
event
justified
him
with
unexpected
suddenness
no
sooner
had
she
passed
the
turnstile
than
a
man
stepped
forward
saluting
her
in
form
eve
shook
hands
with
him
and
they
walked
on
uncontrollable
wrath
seized
on
hilliard
and
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
a
meeting
of
this
kind
was
precisely
what
he
had
foreseen
and
he
resented
it
violently
eve
acquaintance
had
the
external
attributes
of
a
gentleman
one
could
not
easily
imagine
him
a
clerk
or
a
smartened
up
for
the
occasion
he
was
plain
of
feature
but
wore
a
pleasant
honest
look
and
his
demeanour
to
the
girl
showed
not
only
good
breeding
but
unmistakable
interest
of
the
warmest
kind
his
age
might
perhaps
be
thirty
he
was
dressed
well
and
in
all
respects
conventionally
in
eve
behaviour
there
appeared
a
very
noticeable
reserve
she
rarely
turned
her
face
to
him
while
he
spoke
and
seemed
to
make
only
the
briefest
remarks
her
attention
was
given
to
the
objects
they
passed
totally
unconscious
of
the
scenes
through
which
he
was
moving
hilliard
tracked
the
couple
for
more
than
an
hour
he
noticed
that
the
man
once
took
out
his
watch
and
from
this
trifling
incident
he
sought
to
derive
a
hope
perhaps
eve
would
be
quit
ere
long
of
the
detested
companionship
they
came
at
length
to
where
a
band
was
playing
and
sat
down
on
chairs
the
pursuer
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
seat
behind
them
but
the
clamour
of
instruments
overpowered
their
voices
or
rather
the
man
voice
for
eve
seemed
not
to
speak
at
all
one
moment
when
her
neighbour
head
approached
nearer
than
usual
to
hers
she
drew
slightly
away
the
music
ceased
whereupon
eve
companion
again
consulted
his
watch
it
a
most
unfortunate
thing
he
was
audible
now
i
ca
possibly
stay
longer
eve
moved
on
her
chair
as
if
in
readiness
to
take
leave
of
him
but
she
did
not
speak
you
think
it
likely
you
will
meet
miss
ringrose
eve
answered
but
the
listener
could
not
catch
her
words
i
so
very
sorry
if
there
had
been
any
the
voice
sank
and
hilliard
could
only
gather
from
observance
of
the
man
face
that
he
was
excusing
himself
in
fervent
tones
for
the
necessity
of
departure
then
they
both
rose
and
walked
a
few
yards
together
finally
with
a
sense
of
angry
exultation
hilliard
saw
them
part
for
a
little
while
eve
stood
watching
the
musicians
who
were
making
ready
to
play
a
new
piece
as
soon
as
the
first
note
sounded
she
moved
slowly
her
eyes
cast
down
with
fiercely
throbbing
heart
thinking
and
desiring
and
hoping
he
knew
not
what
hilliard
once
more
followed
her
night
had
now
fallen
the
grounds
of
the
exhibition
shone
with
illumination
the
throng
grew
dense
it
was
both
easy
and
necessary
to
keep
very
near
to
the
object
of
his
interest
there
sounded
a
clinking
of
plates
cups
and
glasses
people
were
sitting
at
tables
in
the
open
air
supplied
with
refreshments
by
the
waiters
who
hurried
hither
and
thither
eve
after
a
show
of
hesitation
took
a
seat
by
a
little
round
table
which
stood
apart
her
pursuer
found
a
place
whence
he
could
keep
watch
she
gave
an
order
and
presently
there
was
brought
to
her
a
glass
of
wine
with
a
sandwich
hilliard
called
for
a
bottle
of
ale
he
was
consumed
with
thirst
dare
i
approach
her
he
asked
himself
is
it
possible
and
if
possible
is
it
any
use
the
difficulty
was
to
explain
his
recognition
of
her
but
for
that
he
might
justify
himself
in
addressing
her
she
had
finished
her
wine
and
was
looking
round
her
glance
fell
upon
him
and
for
a
moment
rested
with
a
courage
not
his
own
hilliard
rose
advanced
and
respectfully
doffed
his
hat
miss
madeley
the
note
was
half
interrogative
but
his
voice
failed
before
he
could
add
another
syllable
eve
drew
herself
up
rigid
in
the
alarm
of
female
instinct
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
hilliard
managed
to
say
but
i
come
from
dudley
i
know
some
of
your
friends
his
hurried
words
fell
into
coherence
at
the
name
dudley
features
relaxed
was
it
you
who
called
at
my
lodgings
the
day
before
yesterday
i
did
your
address
was
given
me
by
mrs
brewer
in
whose
house
i
have
lived
for
a
long
time
she
wished
me
to
call
and
to
give
you
a
kind
message
to
say
how
glad
they
would
be
to
hear
from
you
but
you
leave
the
message
the
smile
put
hilliard
at
his
ease
it
was
so
gentle
and
friendly
i
was
able
to
come
at
the
time
i
mentioned
i
should
have
called
but
how
is
it
that
you
knew
me
i
think
she
added
without
waiting
for
a
reply
that
i
have
seen
you
somewhere
but
i
ca
remember
where
perhaps
in
the
train
this
evening
yes
so
it
was
you
knew
me
then
i
thought
i
did
for
i
happened
to
come
out
from
my
lodgings
at
the
moment
you
were
leaving
yours
just
opposite
and
we
walked
almost
together
to
gower
street
station
i
must
explain
that
i
have
taken
rooms
in
gower
place
i
did
like
to
speak
to
you
in
the
street
but
now
that
i
have
again
chanced
to
see
you
i
still
do
understand
said
eve
who
was
speaking
with
the
most
perfect
ease
of
manner
i
am
not
the
only
person
living
in
that
house
why
should
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
was
miss
madeley
hilliard
had
not
ventured
to
seat
himself
he
stood
before
her
head
respectfully
bent
at
mrs
brewer
i
saw
your
portrait
her
eyes
fell
my
portrait
you
really
could
recognise
me
from
that
oh
readily
will
you
allow
me
to
sit
down
of
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
the
news
you
have
brought
i
could
imagine
who
it
was
had
called
and
wanted
to
see
me
but
there
another
thing
i
did
think
mrs
brewer
knew
my
address
i
have
moved
since
i
wrote
to
her
daughter
no
it
was
the
old
address
she
gave
me
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
it
escaped
my
mind
first
of
all
i
went
to
belmont
street
mysteries
still
exclaimed
eve
the
people
could
know
where
i
had
gone
to
a
child
who
had
carried
some
parcel
for
you
to
gower
place
volunteered
information
outwardly
amused
and
bearing
herself
as
though
no
incident
could
easily
disconcert
her
eve
did
not
succeed
in
suppressing
every
sign
of
nervousness
constrained
by
his
wonder
to
study
her
with
critical
attention
the
young
man
began
to
feel
assured
that
she
was
consciously
acting
a
part
that
she
should
be
able
to
carry
it
off
so
well
therein
lay
the
marvel
of
course
london
had
done
much
for
her
possessing
no
common
gifts
she
must
have
developed
remarkably
under
changed
conditions
and
must
indeed
have
become
a
very
different
person
from
the
country
girl
who
toiled
to
support
her
drunken
father
family
hilliard
remembered
the
mention
of
her
sister
who
had
gone
to
birmingham
disappeared
it
suggested
a
characteristic
of
the
madeley
blood
which
possibly
must
be
borne
in
mind
if
he
would
interpret
eve
she
rested
her
arms
on
the
little
round
table
so
mrs
brewer
asked
you
to
come
and
find
me
it
was
only
a
suggestion
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
how
it
came
about
i
used
to
have
my
meals
in
mrs
brewer
parlour
and
to
amuse
myself
i
looked
over
her
album
there
i
found
your
portrait
and
well
it
interested
me
and
i
asked
the
name
of
the
original
hilliard
was
now
in
command
of
himself
he
spoke
with
simple
directness
as
his
desires
dictated
and
mrs
brewer
said
eve
with
averted
eyes
told
you
about
me
she
spoke
of
you
as
her
daughter
friend
was
the
evasive
answer
eve
seemed
to
accept
it
as
sufficient
and
there
was
a
long
silence
my
name
is
hilliard
the
young
man
resumed
i
am
taking
the
first
holiday
worth
speaking
of
that
i
have
known
for
a
good
many
years
at
dudley
my
business
was
to
make
mechanical
drawings
and
i
ca
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
occupation
are
you
going
back
to
it
not
just
yet
i
have
been
in
france
and
i
may
go
abroad
again
before
long
for
your
pleasure
eve
asked
with
interest
to
answer
would
quite
express
what
i
mean
i
am
learning
to
live
she
hastily
searched
his
face
for
the
interpretation
of
these
words
then
looked
away
with
grave
thoughtful
countenance
by
good
fortune
hilliard
pursued
i
have
become
possessed
of
money
enough
to
live
upon
for
a
year
or
two
at
the
end
of
it
i
may
find
myself
in
the
old
position
and
have
to
be
a
living
machine
once
more
but
i
shall
be
able
to
remember
that
i
was
once
a
man
eve
regarded
him
strangely
with
wide
in
tent
eyes
as
though
his
speech
had
made
a
peculiar
impression
upon
her
can
you
see
any
sense
in
that
he
asked
smiling
yes
i
think
i
understand
you
she
spoke
slowly
and
hilliard
watching
her
saw
in
her
face
more
of
the
expression
of
her
portrait
than
he
had
yet
discovered
her
soft
tone
was
much
more
like
what
he
had
expected
to
hear
than
her
utterances
hitherto
have
you
always
lived
at
dudley
she
asked
he
sketched
rapidly
the
course
of
his
life
without
reference
to
domestic
circumstances
before
he
had
ceased
speaking
he
saw
that
look
was
directed
towards
something
at
a
distance
behind
him
she
smiled
and
at
length
nodded
in
recognition
of
some
person
who
approached
then
a
voice
caused
him
to
look
round
oh
there
you
are
i
have
been
hunting
for
you
ever
so
long
as
soon
as
hilliard
saw
the
speaker
he
had
no
difficulty
in
remembering
her
it
was
eve
companion
of
the
day
before
yesterday
with
whom
she
had
started
for
the
theatre
the
girl
evidently
felt
some
surprise
at
discovering
her
friend
in
conversation
with
a
man
she
did
not
know
but
eve
was
equal
to
the
situation
and
spoke
calmly
this
gentleman
is
from
my
part
of
the
world
from
dudley
hilliard
miss
ringrose
hilliard
stood
up
miss
ringrose
after
attempting
a
bow
of
formal
dignity
jerked
out
her
hand
gave
a
shy
little
laugh
and
said
with
amusing
abruptness
do
you
really
come
from
dudley
i
do
really
miss
ringrose
why
does
it
sound
strange
to
you
oh
i
do
mean
that
it
sounds
strange
she
spoke
in
a
high
but
not
unmusical
note
very
quickly
and
with
timid
glances
to
either
side
of
her
collocutor
but
eve
miss
madeley
gave
me
the
idea
that
dudley
people
must
be
great
rough
sooty
men
do
laugh
at
me
please
you
know
very
well
eve
that
you
always
talk
in
that
way
of
course
i
knew
that
there
must
be
people
of
a
different
kind
but
there
now
you
making
me
confused
and
i
do
know
what
i
meant
to
say
she
was
a
but
rather
pretty
girl
with
auburn
hair
belonging
to
a
class
which
especially
in
its
women
has
little
intelligence
to
boast
of
she
yet
redeemed
herself
from
the
charge
of
commonness
by
a
certain
vivacity
of
feature
and
an
agreeable
suggestion
of
good
feeling
in
her
frank
but
nervous
manner
hilliard
laughed
merrily
at
the
vision
in
her
mind
of
great
rough
sooty
men
i
sorry
to
disappoint
you
miss
ringrose
no
but
really
what
sort
of
a
place
is
dudley
is
it
true
that
they
call
it
the
black
country
let
us
walk
about
interposed
eve
hilliard
will
tell
you
all
he
can
about
the
black
country
she
moved
on
and
they
rambled
aimlessly
among
clerks
and
shopmen
each
with
the
female
of
his
kind
in
wondrous
hat
and
drapery
among
domestic
groups
from
the
suburbs
and
from
regions
of
the
artisan
among
the
frankly
rowdy
and
the
solemnly
superior
here
and
there
a
man
in
evening
dress
generally
conscious
of
his
white
tie
and
starched
shirt
and
a
sprinkling
of
unattached
young
women
with
roving
eyes
hilliard
excited
by
the
success
of
his
advances
and
by
companionship
after
long
solitude
became
very
unlike
himself
talking
and
jesting
freely
most
of
the
conversation
passed
between
him
and
miss
ringrose
eve
had
fallen
into
an
absent
mood
answered
carelessly
when
addressed
laughed
without
genuine
amusement
and
sometimes
wore
the
look
of
trouble
which
hilliard
had
observed
whilst
in
the
train
before
long
she
declared
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
what
the
hurry
said
her
friend
it
nothing
like
ten
yet
is
it
mr
hilliard
i
do
wish
to
stay
any
longer
of
course
you
need
go
unless
you
like
patty
hilliard
had
counted
on
travelling
back
with
her
to
his
great
disappointment
eve
answered
his
request
to
be
allowed
to
do
so
with
a
coldly
civil
refusal
which
there
was
no
misunderstanding
but
i
hope
you
will
let
me
see
you
again
as
you
live
so
near
me
she
answered
we
are
pretty
sure
to
meet
are
you
coming
or
not
patty
oh
of
course
i
shall
go
if
you
do
the
young
man
shook
hands
with
them
rather
formally
with
eve
with
patty
ringrose
as
cordially
as
if
they
were
old
friends
and
then
he
lost
sight
of
them
amid
the
throng
chapter
vii
how
did
eve
madeley
contrive
to
lead
this
life
of
leisure
and
amusement
the
question
occupied
hilliard
well
on
into
the
small
hours
he
could
hit
upon
no
explanation
which
had
the
least
plausibility
was
she
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
man
who
met
her
at
the
exhibition
her
behaviour
in
his
company
by
no
means
supported
such
a
surmise
yet
there
must
be
something
more
than
ordinary
acquaintance
between
the
two
might
not
patty
ringrose
be
able
and
willing
to
solve
for
him
the
riddle
of
eve
existence
but
he
had
no
idea
where
patty
lived
he
recalled
her
words
in
gower
street
you
going
it
eve
and
they
stirred
miserable
doubts
yet
something
more
than
mere
hope
inclined
him
to
believe
that
the
girl
life
was
innocent
her
look
her
talk
reassured
him
so
did
her
friendship
with
such
a
person
as
the
ingenuous
patty
on
learning
that
he
dwelt
close
by
her
she
gave
no
sign
of
an
uneasy
conscience
in
any
case
the
contrast
between
her
actual
life
and
that
suggested
by
mrs
brewer
talk
about
her
was
singular
enough
it
supplied
him
with
a
problem
of
which
the
interest
would
not
easily
be
exhausted
but
he
must
pursue
the
study
with
due
regard
to
honour
and
delicacy
he
would
act
the
spy
no
more
as
eve
had
said
they
were
pretty
sure
to
meet
before
long
if
his
patience
failed
it
was
always
possible
for
him
to
write
a
letter
four
days
went
by
and
he
saw
nothing
of
her
on
the
fifth
as
he
was
walking
homeward
in
the
afternoon
he
came
face
to
face
with
miss
madeley
in
gower
street
she
stopped
at
once
and
offered
a
friendly
hand
will
you
let
me
walk
a
little
way
with
you
he
asked
certainly
i
just
going
to
change
a
book
at
mudie
she
carried
a
little
handbag
i
suppose
you
have
been
going
about
london
a
great
deal
do
the
streets
look
beautiful
at
this
time
of
the
year
beautiful
i
not
sure
that
i
see
much
beauty
oh
do
you
i
delight
in
london
i
had
dreamt
of
it
all
my
life
before
i
came
here
i
always
said
to
myself
i
should
some
day
live
in
london
her
voice
had
a
vibrant
quality
which
seemed
to
result
from
some
agreeable
emotion
hilliard
remarked
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
a
colour
in
her
cheeks
which
gave
her
an
appearance
of
better
health
than
a
few
days
ago
you
never
go
into
the
country
he
said
feeling
unable
to
join
in
her
praise
of
london
though
it
was
intelligible
enough
to
him
i
go
now
and
then
as
far
as
hampstead
heath
eve
answered
with
a
smile
if
it
fine
i
shall
be
there
next
sunday
with
patty
ringrose
hilliard
grasped
the
opportunity
would
she
permit
him
to
meet
her
and
miss
ringrose
at
hampstead
without
shadow
of
constraint
or
affectation
eve
replied
that
such
a
meeting
would
give
her
pleasure
she
mentioned
place
and
time
at
which
they
might
conveniently
encounter
he
walked
with
her
all
the
way
to
the
library
and
attended
her
back
to
gower
place
the
result
of
this
conversation
was
merely
to
intensify
the
conflict
of
feelings
which
eve
had
excited
in
him
her
friendliness
gave
him
no
genuine
satisfaction
her
animated
mood
in
spite
of
the
charm
to
which
he
submitted
disturbed
him
with
mistrust
nothing
she
said
sounded
quite
sincere
yet
it
was
more
difficult
than
ever
to
imagine
that
she
played
a
part
quite
alien
to
her
disposition
no
word
had
fallen
from
her
which
threw
light
upon
her
present
circumstances
and
he
feared
to
ask
any
direct
question
it
had
surprised
him
to
learn
that
she
subscribed
to
mudie
the
book
she
brought
away
with
her
was
a
newly
published
novel
and
in
the
few
words
they
exchanged
on
the
subject
while
standing
at
the
library
counter
she
seemed
to
him
to
exhibit
a
surprising
acquaintance
with
the
literature
of
the
day
of
his
own
shortcomings
in
this
respect
he
was
but
too
sensible
and
he
began
to
feel
himself
an
intellectual
inferior
where
every
probability
had
prepared
him
for
the
reverse
the
next
morning
he
went
to
mudie
on
his
own
account
and
came
away
with
volumes
chosen
from
those
which
lay
on
the
counter
he
was
tired
of
wandering
about
the
town
and
might
as
well
pass
his
time
in
reading
when
sunday
came
he
sought
the
appointed
spot
at
hampstead
and
there
after
an
hour
waiting
met
the
two
friends
eve
was
no
longer
in
her
vivacious
mood
brilliant
sunshine
and
the
breeze
upon
the
heath
had
no
power
to
inspirit
her
spoke
in
monosyllables
and
behaved
with
unaccountable
reserve
hilliard
had
no
choice
but
to
converse
with
patty
who
was
as
gay
and
entertaining
as
ever
in
the
course
of
their
gossip
he
learnt
that
miss
ringrose
was
employed
at
a
kept
by
her
uncle
where
she
sold
the
latest
songs
and
dances
and
tried
over
on
a
piano
any
unfamiliar
piece
which
a
customer
might
think
of
purchasing
it
was
not
easy
to
understand
how
these
two
girls
came
to
be
so
intimate
for
they
seemed
to
have
very
little
in
common
compared
with
eve
madeley
patty
was
an
insignificant
little
person
but
of
her
moral
uprightness
hilliard
felt
only
the
more
assured
the
longer
he
talked
with
her
and
this
still
had
a
favourable
effect
upon
his
estimate
of
eve
again
there
passed
a
few
days
without
event
but
about
nine
on
wednesday
evening
as
he
sat
at
home
over
a
book
his
landlady
entered
the
room
with
a
surprising
announcement
there
a
young
lady
wishes
to
see
you
sir
miss
ringrose
is
the
name
hilliard
sprang
up
please
ask
her
to
come
in
the
woman
eyed
him
in
a
manner
he
was
too
excited
to
understand
she
would
like
to
speak
to
you
at
the
door
sir
if
you
would
mind
going
out
he
hastened
thither
the
front
door
stood
open
and
a
light
from
the
passage
shone
on
patty
face
in
the
girl
look
he
saw
at
once
that
something
was
wrong
oh
hilliard
i
did
know
your
number
i
been
to
a
lot
of
houses
asking
for
you
what
is
it
he
inquired
going
out
on
to
the
doorstep
i
called
to
see
eve
and
i
do
know
what
it
meant
but
she
gone
away
the
landlady
says
she
left
this
morning
with
her
luggage
went
away
for
good
and
it
so
strange
that
she
has
let
me
know
anything
i
ca
understand
it
i
wanted
to
ask
if
you
know
hilliard
stared
at
the
house
opposite
i
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
come
in
and
tell
me
if
you
would
mind
coming
out
yes
yes
one
moment
i
get
my
hat
he
rejoined
the
girl
and
they
turned
in
the
direction
of
euston
square
where
people
were
few
i
could
help
coming
to
see
you
hilliard
said
patty
whose
manner
indicated
the
gravest
concern
it
has
put
me
in
such
a
fright
i
have
seen
her
since
sunday
i
came
as
soon
as
i
could
get
away
from
the
shop
because
i
did
feel
easy
in
my
mind
about
her
why
did
you
feel
anxious
what
has
been
going
on
he
search
her
face
patty
turned
away
kept
silence
for
a
moment
al
at
length
with
one
of
her
wonted
outbursts
of
confidence
said
nervously
it
something
i
ca
explain
but
as
you
were
a
friend
of
hers
a
man
came
by
and
patty
broke
off
chapter
viii
hilliard
waited
for
her
to
continue
but
patty
kept
her
eyes
down
and
said
no
more
did
you
think
he
asked
that
i
was
likely
to
be
in
miss
confidence
you
known
her
a
long
time
have
you
this
proof
of
reticence
or
perhaps
of
deliberate
misleading
on
part
astonished
hilliard
he
replied
evasively
that
he
had
very
little
acquaintance
with
miss
madeley
affairs
and
added
may
she
not
simply
have
changed
her
lodgings
why
should
she
go
so
suddenly
and
without
letting
me
know
what
had
the
landlady
to
say
she
heard
her
tell
the
cab
to
drive
to
mudie
the
library
you
know
why
said
hilliard
that
meant
perhaps
that
she
wanted
to
return
a
book
before
leaving
london
is
there
any
chance
that
she
has
gone
home
to
dudley
perhaps
her
father
is
ill
and
she
was
sent
for
patty
admitted
this
possibility
but
with
every
sign
of
doubt
the
landlady
said
she
had
a
letter
this
morning
did
she
then
it
may
have
been
from
dudley
but
you
know
her
so
much
better
than
i
do
of
course
you
must
tell
me
anything
you
feel
it
right
to
speak
of
still
did
it
occur
to
you
that
i
could
be
of
any
use
no
i
did
think
i
only
came
because
i
was
so
upset
when
i
found
her
gone
i
knew
you
lived
in
gower
place
somewhere
and
i
thought
you
might
have
seen
her
since
sunday
i
have
not
but
surely
you
will
hear
from
her
very
soon
you
may
even
get
a
letter
tonight
or
morning
patty
gave
a
little
spring
of
hopefulness
yes
a
letter
might
come
by
the
last
post
i
go
home
at
once
and
i
will
come
with
you
said
hilliard
then
you
can
tell
me
whether
you
have
any
news
they
turned
and
walked
towards
the
foot
of
hampstead
road
whence
they
could
go
by
to
patty
abode
in
high
street
camden
town
supported
by
the
hope
of
finding
a
letter
when
she
arrived
miss
ringrose
grew
more
like
herself
you
must
have
wondered
what
i
meant
by
calling
to
see
you
hilliard
i
went
to
five
or
six
houses
before
i
hit
on
the
right
one
i
do
wish
now
that
i
waited
a
little
but
i
always
doing
things
in
that
way
and
being
sorry
for
them
directly
after
eve
is
my
best
friend
you
know
and
that
makes
me
so
anxious
about
her
how
long
have
you
known
her
oh
ever
so
long
about
a
year
the
temptation
to
make
another
inquiry
was
too
strong
for
hilliard
where
has
she
been
employed
of
late
patty
looked
up
at
him
with
surprise
oh
do
you
know
she
is
doing
anything
now
the
people
where
she
was
went
bankrupt
and
she
been
out
of
a
place
for
more
than
a
month
ca
find
another
engagement
she
has
tried
yet
she
taking
a
holiday
it
is
very
nice
work
adding
up
money
all
day
i
sure
it
would
drive
me
out
of
my
senses
very
soon
i
think
she
might
find
something
better
than
that
miss
ringrose
continued
to
talk
of
her
friend
all
the
way
to
camden
town
but
the
information
he
gathered
did
not
serve
to
advance
hilliard
in
his
understanding
of
eve
character
that
she
was
keeping
back
something
of
grave
import
the
girl
had
already
confessed
and
in
her
chatter
she
frequently
checked
herself
on
the
verge
of
an
indiscretion
hilliard
took
for
granted
that
the
mystery
had
to
do
with
the
man
he
had
seen
at
earl
court
if
eve
actually
disappeared
he
would
not
scruple
to
extract
from
patty
all
that
she
knew
but
he
must
see
first
whether
eve
would
communicate
with
her
friend
in
high
street
patty
entered
a
small
shop
which
was
on
the
point
of
being
closed
for
the
night
hilliard
waited
for
her
a
few
yards
away
on
her
return
he
saw
at
once
that
she
was
disappointed
there
nothing
it
may
come
in
the
morning
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
hear
or
not
would
this
be
out
of
your
way
asked
patty
i
generally
alone
in
the
shop
from
one
to
two
there
very
seldom
any
business
going
on
then
then
i
will
come
at
that
time
do
please
if
i
have
heard
anything
i
shall
be
that
nervous
they
talked
to
no
purpose
for
a
few
minutes
and
bade
each
other
next
day
at
the
hour
patty
had
appointed
hilliard
was
again
in
high
street
as
he
approached
the
shop
he
heard
from
within
the
jingle
of
a
piano
a
survey
through
the
closed
glass
door
showed
him
miss
ringrose
playing
for
her
own
amusement
he
entered
and
patty
jumped
up
with
a
smile
of
welcome
it
all
right
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
she
gone
to
dudley
ah
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
any
reason
given
nothing
particular
answered
the
girl
striking
a
note
on
the
piano
with
her
forefinger
she
thought
she
might
as
well
go
home
for
a
week
or
two
before
taking
another
place
she
has
heard
of
something
in
holborn
so
your
alarm
was
groundless
oh
i
did
really
feel
alarmed
hilliard
you
must
think
that
i
often
do
silly
things
patty
look
and
tone
were
far
from
reassuring
evidently
she
had
been
relieved
from
her
suspense
but
no
less
plainly
did
she
seek
to
avoid
an
explanation
of
it
hilliard
began
to
glance
about
the
shop
my
uncle
resumed
patty
turning
with
her
wonted
sprightliness
to
another
subject
always
goes
out
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
play
billiards
i
can
tell
by
his
face
when
he
comes
back
whether
he
lost
or
won
he
does
so
take
it
to
heart
silly
man
do
play
billiards
the
other
shook
his
head
i
thought
not
you
have
a
serious
look
hilliard
did
not
relish
this
compliment
he
imagined
he
had
cast
away
his
gloom
he
desired
to
look
like
the
men
who
take
life
with
easy
courage
as
he
gazed
through
the
glass
door
into
the
street
a
figure
suddenly
blocked
his
prospect
and
a
face
looked
in
then
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
a
young
man
of
clerkly
appearance
who
glanced
from
miss
ringrose
to
her
companion
with
an
air
of
severity
patty
had
reddened
a
little
what
are
doing
here
at
this
time
of
day
she
asked
familiarly
oh
business
had
to
look
up
a
man
over
here
thought
i
speak
a
word
as
i
passed
hilliard
drew
aside
who
has
opened
this
new
shop
opposite
added
the
young
man
beckoning
from
the
doorway
a
more
transparent
pretext
for
drawing
patty
away
could
not
have
been
conceived
but
she
readily
lent
herself
to
it
and
followed
the
door
closed
behind
them
in
a
few
minutes
patty
returned
alone
with
rosy
cheeks
and
mutinous
lips
i
very
sorry
to
have
been
in
the
way
said
hilliard
smiling
oh
not
you
it
all
right
someone
i
know
he
can
be
sensible
enough
when
he
likes
but
sometimes
he
such
a
silly
there
no
putting
up
with
him
have
you
heard
the
new
waltz
the
ballroom
queen
she
sat
down
and
rattled
over
this
exhilarating
masterpiece
thank
you
said
hilliard
you
play
very
cleverly
oh
so
can
anybody
that
nothing
does
miss
madeley
play
at
all
no
she
always
saying
she
wishes
she
could
but
i
tell
her
what
does
it
matter
she
knows
no
end
of
things
that
i
do
and
i
a
good
deal
rather
have
that
she
reads
a
good
deal
i
suppose
oh
i
should
think
she
does
just
and
she
can
speak
french
indeed
how
did
she
learn
at
the
place
where
she
was
bookkeeper
there
was
a
young
lady
from
paris
and
they
shared
lodgings
and
eve
learnt
it
from
her
then
her
friend
went
to
paris
again
and
eve
wanted
very
much
to
go
with
her
but
she
did
see
how
to
manage
it
eve
she
added
with
a
laugh
is
always
wanting
to
do
something
that
impossible
a
week
later
hilliard
again
called
at
the
and
talked
for
half
an
hour
with
miss
ringrose
who
had
no
fresh
news
from
eve
his
visits
were
repeated
at
intervals
of
a
few
days
and
at
length
towards
the
end
of
june
he
learnt
that
miss
madeley
was
about
to
return
to
london
she
had
obtained
a
new
engagement
at
the
establishment
in
holborn
of
which
patty
had
spoken
and
will
she
come
back
to
her
old
lodgings
he
inquired
patty
shook
her
head
she
stay
with
me
i
wanted
her
to
come
here
before
but
she
care
about
it
now
she
altered
her
mind
and
i
very
glad
hilliard
hesitated
in
putting
the
next
question
do
you
still
feel
anxious
about
her
the
girl
met
his
eyes
for
an
instant
no
it
all
right
now
there
one
thing
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
if
you
can
about
miss
madeley
i
do
think
there
can
be
any
harm
in
your
saying
yes
or
no
is
she
engaged
to
be
married
patty
replied
with
a
certain
eagerness
no
indeed
she
is
and
she
never
has
been
thank
you
hilliard
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
i
very
glad
to
know
that
of
course
you
are
patty
answered
with
a
laugh
as
usual
after
one
of
her
frank
remarks
she
turned
away
and
struck
chords
on
the
piano
hilliard
meditated
the
while
until
his
companion
spoke
again
you
see
her
before
long
i
dare
say
perhaps
i
do
know
at
all
events
you
to
see
her
most
likely
will
you
promise
me
something
if
it
in
my
power
to
keep
the
promise
it
only
i
should
be
so
glad
if
you
would
mention
anything
about
my
coming
to
see
you
that
night
in
gower
place
i
wo
speak
of
it
quite
sure
you
may
depend
upon
me
would
you
rather
she
did
know
that
i
have
seen
you
at
all
oh
there
no
harm
in
that
i
should
be
sure
to
let
it
out
i
shall
say
we
met
by
chance
somewhere
very
well
i
feel
tempted
to
ask
a
promise
iii
return
patty
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
eyes
wide
and
lips
slightly
apart
it
is
this
he
continued
lowering
his
voice
if
ever
you
should
begin
to
feel
anxious
again
about
her
will
you
let
me
know
her
reply
was
delayed
it
came
at
length
in
the
form
of
an
embarrassed
nod
thereupon
hilliard
pressed
her
hand
and
departed
he
knew
the
day
on
which
eve
would
arrive
in
london
from
morning
to
night
a
feverish
unrest
drove
him
about
the
streets
on
the
morrow
he
was
scarcely
more
at
ease
and
for
several
days
he
lived
totally
without
occupation
save
in
his
harassing
thoughts
he
paced
and
repaced
the
length
of
holborn
wondering
where
it
was
that
eve
had
found
employment
but
from
camden
town
he
held
aloof
one
morning
there
arrived
for
him
a
postcard
on
which
was
scribbled
we
are
going
to
the
savoy
on
saturday
night
gallery
no
signature
no
address
but
of
course
the
writer
must
be
patty
ringrose
mentally
he
thanked
her
with
much
fervour
and
on
the
stated
evening
nearly
an
hour
before
the
opening
of
the
doors
he
climbed
the
stone
steps
leading
to
the
gallery
entrance
of
the
savoy
theatre
at
the
summit
two
or
three
persons
were
already
waiting
strangers
to
him
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
read
an
evening
paper
at
every
sound
of
approaching
feet
his
eyes
watched
with
covert
eagerness
presently
he
heard
a
laugh
echoing
from
below
and
recognised
patty
voice
then
miss
ringrose
appeared
round
the
winding
in
the
staircase
and
was
followed
by
eve
madeley
patty
glanced
up
and
smiled
consciously
as
she
discovered
the
face
she
had
expected
to
see
but
eve
remained
for
some
minutes
unaware
of
her
acquaintance
proximity
scrutinising
her
appearance
as
he
could
at
his
ease
hilliard
thought
she
looked
far
from
well
she
had
a
tired
dispirited
expression
and
paid
no
heed
to
the
people
about
her
her
dress
was
much
plainer
than
that
she
wore
a
month
ago
he
saw
patty
whispering
to
her
companion
and
as
a
result
eve
eyes
turned
in
his
direction
he
met
her
look
and
had
no
difficulty
in
making
his
way
down
two
or
three
steps
to
join
her
the
reception
she
gave
him
was
one
of
civil
indifference
hilliard
made
no
remark
on
what
seemed
the
chance
of
their
encounter
nor
did
he
speak
of
her
absence
from
london
they
talked
as
far
as
talk
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
of
theatrical
and
kindred
subjects
he
could
not
perceive
that
the
girl
was
either
glad
or
sorry
to
have
met
him
again
but
by
degrees
her
mood
brightened
a
little
and
she
exclaimed
with
pleasure
when
the
opening
of
the
door
caused
an
upward
movement
you
have
been
away
he
said
when
they
were
in
their
places
he
at
one
side
of
eve
patty
on
the
other
yes
at
dudley
did
you
see
mrs
brewer
several
times
she
has
got
another
lodger
yet
and
wishes
you
would
go
back
again
a
most
excellent
character
she
gave
you
this
sounded
satirical
i
deserved
the
best
she
could
say
of
me
hilliard
answered
eve
glanced
at
him
smiled
doubtfully
and
turned
to
talk
with
patty
ringrose
through
the
evening
there
was
no
further
mention
of
dudley
eve
could
with
difficulty
be
induced
to
converse
at
all
and
when
the
entertainment
was
over
she
pointedly
took
leave
of
him
within
the
theatre
but
while
shaking
hands
with
patty
he
saw
something
in
that
young
lady
face
which
caused
him
to
nod
and
smile
chapter
ix
there
came
an
afternoon
early
in
july
when
hilliard
tired
with
a
long
ramble
in
search
of
old
city
churches
his
architectural
interests
never
failed
sought
rest
and
coolness
in
a
fleet
street
tavern
of
name
it
was
long
since
he
had
yielded
to
any
extravagance
his
palate
demanded
wine
and
with
wine
he
solaced
it
when
he
went
forth
again
into
the
roaring
highway
things
glowed
before
him
in
a
mellow
light
the
sounds
of
fleet
street
made
music
to
his
ears
he
looked
with
joyous
benignity
into
the
faces
of
men
and
women
and
nowhere
discovered
a
countenance
inharmonious
with
his
gallant
mood
no
longer
weary
he
strolled
westward
content
with
the
satisfactions
of
each
passing
moment
this
he
said
to
himself
is
the
joy
of
life
past
and
future
are
alike
powerless
over
me
i
live
in
the
glorious
sunlight
of
this
summer
day
under
the
benediction
of
a
greathearted
wine
noble
wine
friend
of
the
friendless
companion
of
the
solitary
of
hearts
that
are
oppressed
inspirer
of
brave
thoughts
in
them
that
fail
beneath
the
burden
of
being
thanks
to
thee
o
priceless
wine
a
bookseller
window
arrested
him
there
open
to
the
gaze
of
every
pedestrian
stood
a
volume
of
which
the
sight
made
him
thrill
with
rapture
a
finely
illustrated
folio
a
treatise
on
the
cathedrals
of
france
five
guineas
was
the
price
it
bore
a
moment
lingering
restrained
by
some
ignoble
spirit
of
thrift
which
the
wine
had
not
utterly
overcome
and
he
entered
the
shop
he
purchased
the
volume
it
would
have
pleased
him
to
carry
it
away
but
in
mere
he
allowed
the
shopman
suggestion
to
prevail
and
gave
his
address
that
the
great
tome
might
be
sent
to
him
how
cheap
it
was
five
guineas
for
so
much
instant
delight
and
such
boundless
joy
of
anticipation
on
one
of
the
benches
in
trafalgar
square
he
sat
for
a
long
time
watching
the
fountains
and
ever
and
anon
letting
them
lead
his
eyes
upwards
to
the
great
snowy
clouds
that
gleamed
upon
the
profound
blue
some
ragged
children
were
at
play
near
him
he
searched
his
pocket
collected
coppers
and
small
silver
and
with
a
friendly
cry
of
holloa
you
ragamuffins
scattered
amazement
and
delight
martin
church
told
him
that
the
hour
was
turned
of
six
then
a
purpose
that
had
hung
vaguely
in
his
mind
like
a
golden
mist
took
form
and
substance
he
set
off
to
walk
northward
came
out
into
holborn
and
loitered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
certain
place
of
business
which
of
late
he
had
many
times
observed
it
was
not
long
that
he
had
to
wait
presently
there
came
forth
someone
whom
he
knew
and
with
quick
steps
he
gained
her
side
eve
madeley
perceived
him
without
surprise
yes
he
said
i
am
here
again
if
it
disagreeable
to
you
tell
me
and
i
will
go
my
own
way
at
once
i
have
no
wish
to
send
you
away
she
answered
with
a
smile
of
but
all
the
same
i
think
it
would
be
wiser
if
you
did
go
ah
then
if
you
leave
me
to
judge
for
myself
you
look
tired
this
evening
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
let
us
turn
for
a
moment
up
this
byway
no
let
us
walk
straight
on
i
beg
of
you
now
you
are
kind
i
am
going
to
dine
at
a
restaurant
usually
i
eat
my
dinner
at
home
a
bad
dinner
and
a
cheerless
room
on
such
an
evening
as
this
i
ca
go
back
and
appease
hunger
in
that
animal
way
but
when
i
sit
down
in
the
restaurant
i
shall
be
alone
it
miserable
to
see
the
groups
of
people
enjoying
themselves
all
round
and
to
sit
lonely
i
ca
tell
you
how
long
it
is
since
i
had
a
meal
in
company
will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
i
ca
do
that
where
the
impossibility
i
should
like
to
do
it
but
would
it
be
so
very
disagreeable
to
sit
and
talk
or
i
wo
ask
you
to
talk
only
to
let
me
talk
to
you
give
me
an
hour
or
two
of
your
time
that
what
i
ask
it
means
so
much
to
me
and
to
you
what
does
it
matter
eve
walked
on
in
silence
his
entreaties
kept
pace
with
her
at
length
she
stopped
it
all
the
same
to
me
if
you
wish
it
thank
you
a
thousand
times
they
walked
back
into
holborn
and
hilliard
talking
merely
of
trifles
led
the
way
to
a
great
hall
where
some
scores
of
people
were
already
dining
he
selected
a
nook
which
gave
assurance
of
privacy
sketched
to
the
waiter
a
modest
but
carefully
chosen
repast
and
from
his
seat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
laughed
silently
at
eve
as
she
leaned
back
on
the
plush
cushions
in
no
way
disconcerted
by
the
show
of
luxury
about
her
eve
seemed
to
be
reflecting
not
without
enjoyment
you
would
rather
be
here
than
going
home
in
the
camden
town
of
course
that
what
i
like
in
you
you
have
courage
to
tell
the
truth
when
you
said
that
you
could
come
it
was
what
you
really
thought
now
that
you
have
learnt
your
mistake
you
confess
it
i
could
have
done
it
if
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
all
the
same
whether
i
came
or
refused
all
the
same
to
you
yes
i
quite
willing
that
you
should
think
it
so
it
puts
me
at
my
ease
i
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
ah
but
how
good
it
is
to
sit
here
and
talk
do
you
know
anyone
else
who
would
come
with
you
have
you
made
any
friends
not
one
you
and
miss
ringrose
are
the
only
persons
i
know
in
london
i
ca
understand
why
you
live
in
that
way
how
should
i
make
friends
among
men
why
it
harder
than
making
money
which
i
have
never
done
yet
and
never
shall
i
afraid
eve
averted
her
eyes
and
again
seemed
to
meditate
i
tell
you
pursued
the
young
man
how
the
money
came
to
me
that
i
am
living
on
now
it
fill
up
the
few
moments
while
we
are
waiting
he
made
of
it
an
entertaining
narrative
which
he
concluded
just
as
the
soup
was
laid
before
them
eve
listened
with
frank
curiosity
with
an
amused
smile
then
came
a
lull
in
the
conversation
hilliard
began
his
dinner
with
appetite
and
gusto
the
girl
after
a
few
sips
neglected
her
soup
and
glanced
about
the
neighboring
tables
in
my
position
said
hilliard
at
length
what
would
you
have
done
it
a
difficult
thing
to
put
myself
in
your
position
is
it
really
why
then
i
will
tell
you
something
more
of
myself
you
say
that
mrs
brewer
gave
me
an
excellent
character
i
certainly
should
have
known
you
from
her
description
hilliard
laughed
i
seem
to
you
so
disreputable
not
exactly
that
replied
eve
thoughtfully
but
you
seem
altogether
a
different
person
from
what
you
seemed
to
her
yes
i
can
understand
that
and
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
for
saying
that
you
miss
madeley
are
as
different
as
possible
from
the
idea
i
formed
of
you
when
i
heard
mrs
brewer
description
she
described
me
i
should
so
like
to
hear
what
she
said
the
changing
of
plates
imposed
a
brief
silence
hilliard
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
saw
that
eve
just
touched
hers
with
her
lips
you
shall
hear
that
but
not
now
i
want
to
enable
you
to
judge
me
and
if
i
let
you
know
the
facts
while
dinner
goes
on
it
wo
be
so
tiresome
as
if
i
began
solemnly
to
tell
you
my
life
as
people
do
in
novels
he
erred
if
anything
on
the
side
of
brevity
but
in
the
succeeding
quarter
of
an
hour
eve
was
able
to
gather
from
his
careless
talk
which
sedulously
avoided
the
pathetic
note
a
fair
notion
of
what
his
existence
had
been
from
boyhood
upward
it
supplemented
the
account
of
himself
she
had
received
from
him
when
they
met
for
the
first
time
as
he
proceeded
she
grew
more
attentive
and
occasionally
allowed
her
eyes
to
encounter
his
there
only
one
other
person
who
has
heard
all
this
from
me
he
said
at
length
that
a
friend
of
mine
at
birmingham
a
man
called
narramore
when
i
got
dengate
money
i
went
to
narramore
and
i
told
him
what
use
i
was
going
to
make
of
it
that
what
you
have
told
me
remarked
the
listener
i
will
now
that
you
can
understand
me
i
resolved
to
go
right
away
from
all
the
sights
and
sounds
that
i
hated
and
to
live
a
man
life
for
just
as
long
as
the
money
would
last
what
do
you
mean
by
a
man
life
why
a
life
of
enjoyment
instead
of
a
life
not
worthy
to
be
called
life
at
all
this
is
part
of
it
this
evening
i
have
had
enjoyable
hours
since
i
left
dudley
but
never
yet
one
like
this
and
because
i
owe
it
to
you
i
shall
remember
you
with
gratitude
as
long
as
i
remember
anything
at
all
that
a
mistake
said
eve
you
owe
the
enjoyment
whatever
it
is
to
your
money
not
to
me
you
prefer
to
look
at
it
in
that
way
be
it
so
i
had
a
delightful
month
in
paris
but
i
was
driven
back
to
england
by
loneliness
now
if
had
been
there
if
i
could
have
seen
you
each
evening
for
an
hour
or
two
had
dinner
with
you
at
the
restaurant
talked
with
you
about
what
i
had
seen
in
the
day
but
that
would
have
been
perfection
and
i
have
never
hoped
for
more
than
moderate
average
pleasure
such
as
ordinary
men
take
as
their
right
what
did
you
do
in
paris
saw
things
i
have
longed
to
see
any
time
the
last
fifteen
years
or
so
learned
to
talk
a
little
french
got
to
feel
a
better
educated
man
than
i
was
before
did
dudley
seem
a
long
way
off
when
you
were
there
asked
eve
half
absently
in
another
you
thought
once
of
going
to
paris
miss
ringrose
told
me
eve
knitted
her
brows
and
made
no
answer
chapter
x
when
fruit
had
been
set
before
them
and
as
he
was
peeling
a
banana
what
a
vast
difference
said
hilliard
between
the
life
of
people
who
dine
and
of
those
who
do
it
is
the
mere
pleasure
of
eating
the
quality
of
the
food
though
that
must
have
a
great
influence
on
mind
and
character
but
to
sit
for
an
hour
or
two
each
evening
in
quiet
orderly
enjoyment
with
graceful
things
about
one
talking
of
whatever
is
pleasant
how
it
civilises
until
three
months
ago
i
never
dined
in
my
life
and
i
know
well
what
a
change
it
has
made
in
me
i
never
dined
till
this
evening
said
eve
never
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
been
at
a
restaurant
for
dinner
yes
hilliard
heard
the
avowal
with
surprise
and
delight
after
all
there
could
not
have
been
much
intimacy
between
her
and
the
man
she
met
at
the
exhibition
when
i
go
back
to
slavery
he
continued
i
shall
bear
it
more
philosophically
it
was
making
me
a
brute
but
i
think
there
be
no
more
danger
of
that
the
memory
of
civilisation
will
abide
with
me
i
shall
remind
myself
that
i
was
once
a
free
man
and
that
will
support
me
eve
regarded
him
with
curiosity
is
there
no
choice
she
asked
while
you
have
money
could
you
find
some
better
way
of
earning
a
living
i
have
given
it
a
thought
now
and
then
but
it
very
doubtful
there
only
one
thing
at
which
i
might
have
done
well
and
architecture
from
studying
it
just
for
my
own
pleasure
i
believe
i
know
more
about
architecture
than
most
men
who
are
not
in
the
profession
but
it
would
take
a
long
time
before
i
could
earn
money
by
it
i
could
prepare
myself
to
be
an
architectural
draughtsman
no
doubt
and
might
do
as
well
that
way
as
drawing
machinery
but
then
why
do
you
go
to
work
it
would
save
you
from
living
in
hideous
places
after
all
does
it
matter
much
if
i
had
anything
else
to
gain
suppose
i
had
any
hope
of
marriage
for
instance
he
said
it
playfully
eve
turned
her
eyes
away
but
gave
no
other
sign
of
i
have
no
such
hope
i
have
seen
too
much
of
marriage
in
poverty
so
have
i
said
his
companion
with
quiet
emphasis
and
when
a
man
absolutely
sure
that
he
will
never
have
an
income
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
it
a
crime
if
he
asks
a
woman
to
share
it
eve
added
coldly
i
agree
with
you
it
well
to
understand
each
other
on
that
talking
of
architecture
i
bought
a
grand
book
this
afternoon
he
described
the
purchase
and
mentioned
what
it
cost
but
at
that
rate
said
eve
your
days
of
slavery
will
come
again
very
soon
oh
it
so
rarely
that
i
spend
a
large
sum
on
most
days
i
satisfy
myself
with
the
feeling
of
freedom
and
live
as
poorly
as
ever
i
did
still
do
suppose
that
i
am
bent
on
making
my
money
last
a
very
long
time
i
can
imagine
myself
spending
it
all
in
a
week
or
two
and
feeling
i
had
its
worth
the
only
question
is
how
can
i
get
most
enjoyment
the
very
best
of
a
lifetime
may
come
within
a
single
day
indeed
i
believe
it
very
often
does
i
doubt
that
at
least
i
know
that
it
could
be
so
with
me
well
what
do
you
aim
at
hilliard
asked
disinterestedly
safety
was
the
prompt
reply
safety
from
what
from
years
of
struggle
to
keep
myself
alive
and
a
miserable
old
age
then
you
might
have
said
a
the
jest
and
its
unexpectedness
struck
sudden
laughter
from
eve
hilliard
joined
in
her
mirth
after
that
she
suggested
had
we
better
go
yes
let
us
walk
quietly
on
the
streets
are
pleasant
after
sunset
on
rising
after
he
had
paid
the
bill
hilliard
chanced
to
see
himself
in
a
mirror
he
had
flushed
cheeks
and
his
hair
was
somewhat
disorderly
in
contrast
with
eve
colourless
composure
his
appearance
was
decidedly
bacchanalian
but
the
thought
merely
amused
him
they
crossed
holborn
and
took
their
way
up
southampton
row
neither
speaking
until
they
were
within
sight
of
russell
square
i
like
this
part
of
london
said
hilliard
at
length
pointing
before
him
i
often
walk
about
the
squares
late
at
night
it
quiet
and
the
trees
make
the
air
taste
fresh
i
did
the
same
sometimes
when
i
lived
in
gower
place
does
it
strike
you
that
we
are
rather
like
each
other
in
some
things
oh
yes
eve
replied
frankly
i
have
noticed
that
you
have
even
in
the
lives
we
have
led
there
a
sort
of
resemblance
is
there
yes
i
see
now
that
there
is
in
russell
square
they
turned
from
the
pavement
and
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
enclosure
i
wish
patty
had
been
with
us
said
eve
all
at
once
she
would
have
enjoyed
it
so
thoroughly
to
be
sure
she
would
well
we
can
dine
again
and
have
patty
with
us
but
after
all
dining
in
london
ca
be
quite
what
it
is
in
paris
i
wish
you
had
gone
back
to
work
again
do
you
know
what
i
should
have
proposed
she
glanced
inquiringly
at
him
why
should
we
all
have
gone
to
paris
for
a
holiday
you
and
patty
could
have
lived
together
and
i
should
have
seen
you
every
day
eve
laughed
why
not
patty
and
i
have
both
so
much
more
money
than
we
know
what
to
do
with
she
answered
money
oh
what
of
that
i
have
money
she
laughed
again
hilliard
was
startled
you
are
talking
rather
wildly
leaving
myself
out
of
the
question
what
would
dally
say
to
such
a
proposal
who
mr
dally
do
you
know
has
patty
told
you
that
she
is
engaged
ah
no
she
has
spoken
of
it
but
i
think
i
must
have
seen
him
at
the
one
day
is
she
likely
to
marry
him
it
is
the
wisest
thing
she
could
do
but
that
may
be
the
end
of
it
he
in
an
auctioneer
office
and
may
have
a
pretty
good
income
some
day
a
long
silence
followed
they
passed
out
of
russell
into
woburn
square
night
was
now
darkening
the
latest
tints
of
the
sky
and
the
lamps
shone
golden
against
dusty
green
at
one
of
the
houses
in
the
narrow
square
festivities
were
toward
carriages
drew
up
before
the
entrance
from
which
a
red
carpet
was
laid
down
across
the
pavement
within
sounded
music
does
this
kind
of
thing
excite
any
ambition
in
you
hilliard
asked
coming
to
a
pause
a
few
yards
away
from
the
carriage
which
was
discharging
its
occupants
yes
i
suppose
it
does
at
all
events
it
makes
me
feel
discontented
i
have
settled
all
that
with
myself
i
am
content
to
look
on
as
if
it
were
a
play
those
people
have
an
idea
of
life
quite
different
from
mine
i
should
enjoy
myself
among
them
you
perhaps
would
i
might
eve
replied
absently
and
she
turned
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
square
you
a
friend
in
paris
do
you
ever
hear
from
her
she
wrote
once
or
twice
after
she
went
back
but
it
has
come
to
an
end
still
you
might
find
her
again
if
you
were
there
eve
delayed
her
reply
a
little
then
spoke
impatiently
what
is
the
use
of
setting
my
thoughts
upon
such
things
day
after
day
i
try
to
forget
what
i
most
wish
for
talk
about
yourself
and
i
will
listen
with
pleasure
but
never
talk
about
me
it
very
hard
to
lay
that
rule
upon
me
i
want
to
hear
you
speak
of
yourself
as
yet
i
hardly
know
you
and
i
never
shall
unless
you
why
should
you
know
me
she
interrupted
in
a
voice
of
irritation
only
because
i
wish
it
more
than
anything
else
i
have
wished
it
from
the
day
when
i
first
saw
your
portrait
oh
that
wretched
portrait
i
should
be
sorry
if
i
thought
it
was
at
all
like
me
it
is
both
like
and
unlike
said
hilliard
what
i
see
of
it
in
your
face
is
the
part
of
you
that
most
pleases
me
and
that
is
my
real
self
at
all
perhaps
not
and
yet
perhaps
you
are
mistaken
that
is
what
i
want
to
learn
from
the
portrait
i
formed
an
idea
of
you
when
i
met
you
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
hopelessly
astray
yet
now
i
do
feel
sure
of
it
you
would
like
to
know
what
has
changed
me
from
the
kind
of
girl
i
was
at
dudley
you
changed
in
some
ways
no
doubt
you
at
all
events
seem
to
think
so
i
can
wait
you
will
tell
me
all
about
it
some
day
you
must
take
that
for
granted
we
have
made
friends
in
a
sort
of
way
just
because
we
happened
to
come
from
the
same
place
and
know
the
same
people
but
he
waited
well
i
was
going
to
say
that
there
no
use
in
our
thinking
much
about
each
other
i
do
ask
you
to
think
of
me
but
i
shall
think
a
great
deal
about
you
for
long
enough
to
come
that
what
i
want
to
prevent
why
because
in
the
end
it
might
be
troublesome
to
me
hilliard
kept
silence
awhile
then
laughed
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
of
things
indifferent
natures
chapter
xi
laziest
of
men
and
worst
of
correspondents
robert
narramore
had
as
yet
sent
no
reply
to
the
letters
in
which
hilliard
acquainted
him
with
his
adventures
in
london
and
abroad
but
at
the
end
of
july
he
vouchsafed
a
perfunctory
scrawl
too
bad
not
to
write
before
but
i
been
floored
every
evening
after
business
in
this
furious
heat
you
may
like
to
hear
that
my
uncle
property
did
make
a
bad
show
i
have
come
in
for
a
round
five
thousand
and
am
putting
it
into
brass
bedsteads
be
able
to
get
away
until
the
end
of
august
may
see
you
then
hilliard
mused
enviously
on
the
brass
bedstead
business
on
looking
in
at
the
camden
town
about
this
time
he
found
patty
ringrose
flurried
and
vexed
by
an
event
which
disturbed
her
prospects
her
uncle
the
shopkeeper
a
widower
of
about
fifty
had
announced
his
intention
of
marrying
again
and
worse
still
of
giving
up
his
business
it
the
landlady
of
the
where
he
goes
to
play
billiards
said
patty
with
scornful
mirth
a
great
fat
woman
oh
and
he
going
to
turn
publican
and
my
aunt
and
me
will
have
to
look
out
for
ourselves
this
aunt
was
the
shopkeeper
maiden
sister
who
had
hitherto
kept
house
for
him
she
had
been
promised
an
allowance
said
patty
but
a
very
mean
one
i
do
care
much
for
myself
the
girl
went
on
there
plenty
of
shops
where
i
can
get
an
engagement
but
of
course
it
wo
be
the
same
as
here
which
has
been
home
for
me
ever
since
i
was
a
child
there
the
things
that
men
will
do
i
told
him
plain
to
his
face
that
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
and
so
has
aunt
and
he
ashamed
what
more
do
you
call
it
disgusting
such
a
marriage
as
that
hilliard
avoided
the
delicate
question
i
should
wonder
if
it
hastens
another
marriage
he
said
with
a
smile
i
know
what
you
mean
but
the
chances
are
that
marriage
wo
come
off
at
all
i
getting
tired
of
men
they
so
selfish
and
unreasonable
of
course
i
do
mean
you
hilliard
but
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
dally
has
fallen
under
your
displeasure
please
do
talk
about
him
if
he
thinks
he
going
to
lay
down
the
law
to
me
he
find
his
mistake
and
it
better
he
should
find
it
out
before
it
too
late
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
patty
amorous
uncle
who
returned
from
his
billiards
earlier
than
usual
he
scowled
at
the
stranger
but
passed
into
the
house
without
speaking
hilliard
spoke
a
hurried
word
or
two
about
eve
and
went
his
way
something
less
than
a
week
after
this
he
chanced
to
be
away
from
home
throughout
the
whole
day
and
on
returning
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
telegram
upon
his
table
it
came
from
patty
ringrose
and
asked
him
to
call
at
the
shop
without
fail
between
one
and
two
that
day
the
hour
was
now
nearly
ten
the
despatch
had
arrived
at
eleven
in
the
morning
without
a
minute
delay
he
ran
out
in
search
of
a
cab
and
was
driven
to
high
street
here
of
course
he
found
the
shop
closed
but
it
was
much
too
early
for
the
household
to
have
retired
to
rest
risking
an
indiscretion
he
was
about
to
ring
the
house
bell
when
the
door
opened
and
patty
showed
herself
oh
is
it
mr
hilliard
she
exclaimed
in
a
flurried
voice
i
heard
the
cab
stop
and
i
thought
it
might
be
you
better
come
in
quick
he
followed
her
along
the
passage
and
into
the
shop
where
one
was
burning
low
listen
she
resumed
whispering
hurriedly
if
eve
comes
she
let
herself
in
with
the
latchkey
you
must
stand
quiet
here
i
shall
turn
out
the
gas
and
i
let
you
out
after
she
gone
upstairs
you
come
before
hilliard
explained
and
begged
her
to
tell
him
what
was
the
matter
but
patty
kept
him
in
suspense
uncle
wo
be
in
till
after
twelve
so
there
no
fear
aunt
has
gone
to
bed
she
upset
with
quarrelling
about
this
marriage
mind
you
wo
stir
if
eve
comes
in
do
talk
loud
i
must
keep
listening
for
the
door
but
what
is
it
where
is
eve
i
do
know
she
did
come
home
till
very
late
last
night
and
i
do
know
where
she
was
you
remember
what
you
asked
me
to
promise
to
let
me
know
if
you
were
anxious
about
her
yes
and
i
am
she
in
danger
i
only
hope
what
i
do
like
to
tell
you
all
i
know
it
does
seem
right
but
i
so
afraid
for
eve
i
can
only
imagine
one
kind
of
danger
yes
of
course
it
that
you
know
what
i
mean
but
there
more
than
you
could
fancy
tell
me
then
what
has
alarmed
you
when
did
you
see
her
last
patty
inquired
more
than
a
week
ago
two
or
three
days
before
i
came
here
had
you
noticed
anything
nothing
unusual
no
more
did
i
till
last
monday
night
then
i
saw
that
something
was
wrong
hush
she
gripped
his
arm
and
they
listened
but
no
sound
could
be
heard
and
since
then
patty
pursued
with
tremulous
eagerness
she
been
very
queer
i
know
she
does
sleep
at
night
and
she
getting
ill
and
she
had
letters
from
someone
she
ought
to
have
anything
to
do
with
having
told
so
much
you
had
better
tell
me
all
said
hilliard
impatiently
there
was
a
cold
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
his
heart
beat
painfully
no
i
ca
i
can
only
give
you
a
warning
but
what
the
use
of
that
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
interfere
i
do
know
replied
the
girl
with
a
helpless
sigh
she
in
danger
that
all
i
call
tell
you
patty
do
be
a
fool
out
with
it
who
is
the
man
is
it
some
one
you
know
i
do
exactly
know
him
i
seen
him
is
he
a
sort
of
gentleman
oh
yes
he
a
gentleman
and
you
never
think
to
look
at
him
that
he
could
do
anything
that
was
right
very
well
what
reason
have
you
for
supposing
that
he
doing
wrong
patty
kept
silence
a
band
of
rowdy
fellows
just
then
came
shouting
along
the
street
and
one
of
them
crashed
up
against
the
shop
door
making
patty
jump
and
scream
oaths
and
foul
language
followed
and
then
the
uproar
passed
away
look
here
said
hilliard
you
drive
me
out
of
my
senses
eve
is
in
love
with
this
man
is
she
i
afraid
so
she
was
before
she
went
away
you
mean
and
of
course
her
going
away
had
something
to
do
with
it
yes
it
had
hilliard
laid
his
hands
on
the
girl
shoulders
you
got
to
tell
me
the
plain
truth
and
be
quick
about
it
i
suppose
you
have
any
idea
of
the
torments
i
suffering
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
making
a
fool
of
me
and
that
there
nothing
but
though
that
bad
enough
for
me
very
well
i
tell
you
she
went
away
because
it
came
out
that
the
man
was
married
oh
that
it
he
spoke
from
a
dry
throat
she
told
you
herself
yes
not
long
after
she
came
back
she
said
of
course
she
could
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
she
used
to
meet
him
pretty
often
stay
how
did
she
get
to
know
him
first
just
by
chance
somewhere
i
understand
said
hilliard
grimly
go
on
and
his
wife
got
someone
to
spy
on
him
and
they
found
out
he
was
meeting
eve
and
she
jumped
out
on
them
when
they
were
walking
somewhere
together
and
told
eve
everything
he
was
living
with
his
wife
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
what
his
position
he
in
business
and
seems
to
have
lots
of
money
but
i
do
exactly
know
what
it
is
he
does
you
are
afraid
then
that
eve
is
being
drawn
back
to
him
i
feel
sure
she
is
and
it
dreadful
what
i
should
like
to
know
said
hilliard
harshly
is
whether
she
really
cares
for
him
or
only
for
his
money
oh
how
horrid
you
are
i
never
thought
you
could
say
such
a
thing
perhaps
you
did
all
the
same
it
a
question
i
do
pretend
to
understand
eve
madeley
and
i
afraid
you
are
just
as
far
from
knowing
her
i
do
know
her
why
what
are
you
talking
about
mr
hilliard
what
do
you
think
of
her
then
is
she
a
girl
or
or
what
of
course
she
the
things
that
men
do
say
they
seem
to
be
all
alike
women
are
so
far
from
being
all
alike
that
one
may
think
she
understands
another
and
be
utterly
deceived
eve
has
shown
her
best
side
to
you
no
doubt
with
me
she
has
taken
any
trouble
to
do
so
and
if
hush
this
time
the
alarm
was
justified
a
latchkey
rattled
at
the
the
door
opened
and
in
the
same
moment
patty
turned
out
the
light
it
my
uncle
she
whispered
do
stir
chapter
xii
a
heavy
footstep
sounded
in
the
passage
and
hilliard
to
whose
emotions
was
now
added
a
sense
of
ludicrous
indignity
heard
talk
between
patty
and
her
uncle
you
must
lock
up
yet
said
the
girl
eve
is
out
what
she
doing
i
do
know
at
the
theatre
with
friends
i
dare
say
if
we
been
staying
on
here
that
young
woman
would
have
had
to
look
out
for
another
lodging
there
something
i
do
like
about
her
and
if
you
take
my
advice
patty
you
shake
her
off
she
do
you
no
good
my
girl
they
passed
together
into
the
room
behind
the
shop
and
though
their
voices
were
still
audible
hilliard
could
no
longer
follow
the
conversation
he
stood
motionless
just
where
patty
had
left
him
with
a
hand
resting
on
the
top
of
the
piano
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
at
least
half
an
hour
went
by
then
a
sound
close
by
made
him
start
it
was
the
snapping
of
a
violin
string
the
note
reverberated
through
the
silent
shop
but
by
this
time
the
murmur
of
conversation
had
ceased
and
hilliard
hoped
that
patty
uncle
had
gone
upstairs
to
bed
as
proved
to
be
the
case
presently
the
door
opened
and
a
voice
called
to
him
in
a
whisper
he
obeyed
the
summons
and
not
without
stumbling
followed
patty
into
the
open
air
she
has
come
yet
what
the
time
eleven
i
shall
sit
up
for
her
did
you
hear
what
my
uncle
said
you
must
think
anything
of
that
he
always
finding
fault
with
people
do
you
think
she
will
come
at
all
asked
hilliard
oh
of
course
she
will
i
shall
wait
about
do
stand
here
you
wo
let
her
know
what
i
told
you
said
patty
retaining
his
hand
no
i
wo
if
she
does
come
back
at
all
i
see
you
he
moved
away
and
the
door
closed
many
people
were
still
passing
along
the
street
in
his
uncertainty
as
to
the
direction
by
which
eve
would
return
if
return
she
did
hilliard
ventured
only
a
few
yards
away
he
had
waited
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
his
eye
distinguished
a
figure
quickly
approaching
he
hurried
forward
and
eve
stopped
before
he
had
quite
come
up
to
her
where
have
you
been
were
his
first
words
sounding
more
roughly
than
he
in
tended
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
passed
your
lodgings
and
saw
there
was
no
light
in
the
windows
else
i
should
have
asked
for
you
she
spoke
in
so
strange
a
voice
with
such
show
of
agitation
that
hilliard
stood
gazing
at
her
till
she
again
broke
silence
have
you
been
waiting
here
for
me
yes
patty
told
me
you
were
back
why
did
you
come
why
do
i
ever
come
to
meet
you
we
ca
talk
here
said
eve
turning
away
come
into
a
quieter
place
they
walked
in
silence
to
the
foot
of
high
street
and
there
turned
aside
into
the
shadowed
solitude
of
mornington
crescent
eve
checked
her
steps
and
said
abruptly
i
want
to
ask
you
for
something
what
is
it
now
that
it
comes
to
saying
it
i
i
afraid
and
yet
if
i
had
asked
you
that
evening
when
we
were
at
the
restaurant
what
is
it
hilliard
repeated
gruffly
that
is
your
usual
way
of
speaking
to
me
will
you
tell
me
where
you
have
been
tonight
nowhere
walking
about
do
you
often
walk
about
the
streets
till
midnight
indeed
i
do
the
reply
surprised
him
by
its
humility
her
voice
all
but
broke
on
the
words
as
well
as
the
dim
light
would
allow
he
searched
her
face
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
eyes
had
a
redness
as
if
from
shedding
tears
you
have
been
alone
no
i
been
with
a
friend
well
i
have
no
claim
upon
you
it
nothing
to
me
what
friends
you
go
about
with
what
were
you
going
to
ask
of
me
you
have
changed
so
all
at
once
i
thought
you
would
never
talk
in
this
way
i
did
mean
to
said
hilliard
i
have
lost
control
of
myself
that
all
but
you
can
say
whatever
you
meant
to
say
just
as
you
would
have
done
at
the
restaurant
i
the
same
man
i
was
then
eve
moved
a
few
steps
but
he
did
not
follow
her
and
she
returned
a
policeman
passing
threw
a
glance
at
them
it
no
use
asking
what
i
meant
to
ask
she
said
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
you
wo
grant
it
me
how
can
i
say
till
i
know
what
it
is
there
are
not
many
things
in
my
power
that
i
would
do
for
you
i
was
going
to
ask
for
money
money
why
it
depends
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
it
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
all
the
money
i
have
is
yours
as
you
know
well
enough
but
i
must
understand
why
you
want
it
i
ca
tell
you
that
i
do
want
you
to
give
me
money
only
to
lend
it
you
shall
have
it
back
again
though
i
ca
promise
the
exact
time
if
you
had
changed
so
i
should
have
found
it
easy
enough
to
ask
hut
i
do
know
you
it
like
talking
to
a
stranger
what
has
happened
to
make
you
so
different
i
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
you
that
all
hilliard
replied
endeavouring
to
use
the
tone
of
frank
friendliness
in
which
he
had
been
wont
to
address
her
i
got
nervous
and
irritable
i
felt
uneasy
about
you
it
all
right
now
let
us
walk
on
a
little
you
want
money
well
i
have
three
hundred
pounds
and
more
call
it
mine
call
it
yours
but
i
must
know
that
you
not
going
to
do
anything
foolish
of
course
you
do
tell
me
everything
i
have
no
right
to
expect
it
you
have
misled
me
i
knew
from
the
first
that
well
a
girl
of
your
age
and
with
your
face
does
live
alone
in
london
without
adventures
i
should
think
of
telling
you
all
mine
and
i
do
ask
to
know
yours
unless
i
begin
to
have
a
part
in
them
there
something
wrong
of
course
i
can
see
that
i
think
you
been
crying
and
you
do
shed
tears
for
a
trifle
now
you
come
and
ask
me
for
money
if
it
will
do
you
good
take
all
you
want
but
i
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
harm
may
come
of
it
why
not
treat
me
just
like
a
i
old
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
you
think
so
but
i
know
better
wait
a
moment
how
much
money
do
you
want
pounds
exactly
and
it
is
for
your
own
use
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
i
am
in
very
great
need
of
the
money
and
if
you
will
lend
it
me
i
shall
feel
very
grateful
i
want
no
gratitude
i
want
nothing
from
you
eve
except
what
you
ca
give
me
i
can
imagine
a
man
in
my
position
giving
you
money
in
the
hope
that
it
might
be
your
ruin
just
to
see
you
brought
down
humiliated
there
so
much
of
the
brute
in
us
all
but
i
do
feel
that
desire
why
should
you
she
asked
with
a
change
to
coldness
what
harm
have
i
done
you
no
harm
at
all
and
perhaps
a
great
deal
of
good
i
say
that
i
wish
you
nothing
but
well
suppose
a
gift
of
all
the
money
i
have
would
smooth
your
whole
life
before
you
and
make
you
the
happy
wife
of
some
other
man
i
would
give
it
you
gladly
that
kind
of
thing
has
often
been
said
when
it
meant
nothing
it
is
so
with
me
it
has
always
been
more
pleasure
to
me
to
give
than
to
receive
no
merit
of
mine
i
have
it
from
my
father
make
clear
to
me
that
you
are
to
benefit
by
this
money
and
you
shall
have
the
cheque
as
soon
as
you
please
i
shall
benefit
by
it
because
it
will
relieve
me
from
a
dreadful
anxiety
or
in
other
words
will
relieve
someone
else
i
can
speak
only
of
myself
the
kindness
will
be
done
to
me
i
must
know
more
than
that
come
now
we
assume
that
there
someone
in
the
background
a
friend
of
yours
let
us
say
i
ca
imagine
why
this
friend
of
yours
wants
money
but
so
it
is
you
do
contradict
me
eve
remained
mute
her
head
bent
what
about
your
friend
and
you
in
the
future
are
you
bound
to
this
friend
in
any
irredeemable
way
no
i
am
not
she
answered
with
emotion
there
nothing
between
you
but
let
us
call
it
mere
friendship
nothing
nothing
so
far
so
good
he
looked
keenly
into
her
face
but
how
about
the
future
there
will
never
be
anything
more
there
ca
be
let
us
say
that
you
think
so
at
present
perhaps
i
do
feel
quite
so
sure
of
it
i
say
again
it
nothing
to
me
unless
i
get
drawn
into
it
by
you
yourself
i
am
not
your
guardian
if
i
tell
you
to
be
careful
it
an
impertinence
but
the
money
that
another
affair
i
help
you
to
misery
you
will
be
helping
me
of
misery
eve
exclaimed
yes
for
the
present
i
will
make
a
bargain
with
you
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
you
shall
have
your
pounds
on
condition
that
you
go
to
live
for
as
long
as
i
choose
in
paris
you
are
to
leave
london
in
a
day
or
two
patty
shall
go
with
you
her
uncle
does
want
her
and
she
seems
to
have
quarrelled
with
the
man
she
was
engaged
to
the
expenses
are
my
affair
i
shall
go
to
paris
myself
and
be
there
while
you
are
but
you
need
see
no
more
of
me
than
you
like
those
are
the
terms
i
ca
think
you
are
serious
said
eve
then
i
explain
why
i
wish
you
to
do
this
i
thought
about
you
a
great
deal
in
fact
since
we
first
met
my
chief
occupation
has
been
thinking
about
you
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
suffering
from
an
illness
the
result
of
years
of
hardship
and
misery
we
have
agreed
you
remember
that
there
are
a
good
many
points
of
resemblance
between
your
life
and
mine
and
perhaps
between
your
character
and
mine
now
i
myself
when
i
escaped
from
dudley
was
thoroughly
ill
body
and
soul
the
only
hope
for
me
was
a
complete
change
of
circumstances
to
throw
off
the
weight
of
my
past
life
and
learn
the
meaning
of
repose
satisfaction
enjoyment
i
prescribe
the
same
for
you
i
am
your
physician
i
undertake
your
cure
if
you
refuse
to
let
me
there
an
end
of
everything
between
us
i
shall
say
to
you
tonight
and
set
off
for
some
foreign
country
how
can
i
leave
my
work
at
a
moment
notice
the
devil
take
your
work
for
he
alone
is
the
originator
of
such
accursed
toil
how
can
i
live
at
your
expense
that
a
paltry
obstacle
oh
if
you
are
too
proud
say
so
and
there
an
end
of
it
you
know
me
well
enough
to
feel
the
absolute
truth
of
what
i
say
when
i
assure
you
that
you
will
remain
just
as
independent
of
me
as
you
ever
were
i
shall
be
spending
my
money
in
a
way
that
gives
me
pleasure
the
matter
will
never
appear
to
me
in
any
other
light
why
call
it
an
additional
loan
if
it
will
give
any
satisfaction
to
you
you
are
to
pay
me
back
some
time
here
in
london
you
perish
across
the
channel
there
health
of
body
and
mind
is
awaiting
you
and
are
we
to
talk
about
money
i
shall
begin
to
swear
like
a
trooper
the
thing
is
too
preposterous
eve
said
nothing
she
stood
half
turned
from
him
of
course
he
pursued
you
may
object
to
leave
london
perhaps
the
sacrifice
is
too
great
in
that
case
i
should
only
do
right
if
i
carried
you
off
by
main
force
but
i
afraid
it
ca
be
i
must
leave
you
to
perish
i
am
quite
willing
to
go
away
said
eve
in
a
low
voice
but
the
shame
of
it
to
be
supported
by
you
why
you
do
hate
me
you
know
i
do
not
you
even
have
a
certain
liking
for
me
i
amuse
you
you
think
me
an
odd
sort
of
fellow
perhaps
with
more
good
than
bad
in
me
at
all
events
you
can
trust
me
i
can
trust
you
perfectly
and
it
ai
as
if
i
wished
you
to
go
alone
patty
will
be
off
her
head
with
delight
when
the
thing
is
proposed
to
her
but
how
can
i
explain
to
her
do
attempt
to
leave
her
curiosity
a
good
hard
nut
to
crack
simply
say
you
are
off
to
paris
and
that
if
she
go
with
you
you
will
bear
all
her
expenses
it
so
difficult
to
believe
that
you
are
in
earnest
you
must
somehow
bring
yourself
to
believe
it
there
will
be
a
cheque
ready
for
you
morning
to
take
or
refuse
if
you
take
it
you
are
bound
in
honour
to
leave
england
not
later
than
we
say
thursday
that
you
are
to
be
trusted
i
believe
just
as
firmly
as
you
believe
it
of
me
i
ca
decide
i
can
give
you
only
till
morning
if
i
do
hear
from
you
by
midday
i
am
gone
you
shall
hear
from
me
one
way
or
the
other
then
do
wait
here
any
longer
it
after
midnight
and
patty
will
be
alarmed
about
you
no
we
wo
shake
hands
not
that
till
we
strike
a
bargain
eve
seemed
about
to
walk
away
but
she
hesitated
and
turned
again
i
will
do
as
you
wish
i
will
go
excellent
then
speak
of
it
to
patty
as
soon
as
possible
and
tell
me
what
she
says
when
we
meet
where
and
when
you
like
in
this
same
place
at
nine
so
be
it
i
will
bring
the
cheque
but
i
must
be
able
to
cash
it
at
once
so
you
can
it
will
be
on
a
london
bank
i
get
the
cash
myself
if
you
like
then
they
shook
hands
and
went
in
opposite
directions
chapter
xiii
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
just
after
he
had
lit
his
lamp
hilliard
attention
was
drawn
by
a
sound
as
of
someone
tapping
at
the
window
he
stood
to
listen
and
the
sound
was
repeated
an
unmistakable
tap
of
fingers
on
the
glass
in
a
moment
he
was
out
in
the
street
where
he
discovered
patty
ringrose
why
did
you
come
to
see
me
she
asked
excitedly
i
was
afraid
might
be
there
did
she
go
to
business
as
usual
yes
at
least
i
suppose
so
she
only
got
home
at
the
usual
time
left
her
there
i
was
bound
to
see
you
do
you
know
what
she
told
me
last
night
when
she
came
in
i
dare
say
i
could
guess
hilliard
began
to
walk
down
the
street
patty
keeping
close
at
his
side
regarded
him
with
glances
of
wonder
is
it
true
that
we
going
to
paris
i
could
make
out
whether
she
meant
it
and
this
morning
i
could
get
a
word
from
her
are
you
willing
to
go
with
her
and
have
all
my
expenses
paid
of
course
i
should
think
i
am
but
i
dare
let
my
uncle
and
aunt
know
be
no
end
of
bother
i
shall
have
to
make
up
some
sort
of
tale
to
satisfy
my
aunt
and
get
my
things
sent
to
the
station
while
playing
billiards
how
long
is
it
for
impossible
to
say
three
months
half
a
year
i
do
know
what
about
mr
daily
oh
i
done
with
and
you
are
perfectly
sure
that
you
can
get
employment
whenever
you
need
it
quite
sure
no
need
to
trouble
about
that
i
very
good
friends
with
aunt
and
she
take
me
in
for
as
long
as
i
want
when
i
come
back
but
it
easy
enough
for
anybody
like
me
to
get
a
place
i
had
two
or
three
offers
the
last
from
good
shops
where
they
were
losing
their
young
ladies
we
always
getting
married
in
our
business
and
places
have
to
be
filled
up
that
settles
it
then
but
i
want
to
know
i
ca
make
it
out
eve
wo
tell
me
how
managing
to
go
are
going
to
pay
for
her
we
wo
talk
of
that
patty
she
going
that
enough
you
persuaded
her
last
night
yes
i
persuaded
her
and
i
am
to
hear
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
whether
she
will
go
or
thursday
she
arrange
things
with
you
i
should
think
it
did
look
like
it
she
shut
herself
in
her
room
i
can
understand
that
she
is
that
why
i
getting
her
away
from
london
wait
till
we
been
in
paris
a
few
weeks
and
you
see
how
she
changes
at
present
she
is
downright
ill
ill
enough
to
go
to
bed
and
be
nursed
if
that
would
do
any
good
it
your
part
to
look
after
her
i
do
want
you
to
be
her
servant
oh
i
do
mind
doing
anything
for
her
no
because
you
are
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
you
live
at
a
hotel
and
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
make
her
enjoy
herself
i
wonder
if
you
find
it
difficult
at
first
but
we
shall
get
her
round
before
long
i
never
thought
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
her
perhaps
not
but
i
understand
her
better
of
course
you
wo
say
a
word
of
this
to
her
you
take
it
as
a
holiday
as
good
fun
no
doubt
i
shall
be
able
to
have
a
few
words
in
private
with
you
now
and
then
but
at
other
times
we
must
talk
as
if
nothing
special
had
passed
between
us
patty
mused
the
lightness
of
her
step
told
in
what
a
spirit
of
gaiety
she
looked
forward
to
the
expedition
do
you
think
she
asked
presently
that
it
all
come
to
an
end
what
i
told
you
of
yes
i
think
so
you
did
let
her
know
that
i
been
talking
of
course
not
and
as
i
do
want
her
to
know
that
you
seen
me
you
had
better
stay
no
longer
she
sure
to
have
something
to
tell
you
or
morning
get
your
packing
done
and
be
ready
at
any
moment
when
i
hear
from
eve
in
the
morning
i
shall
send
her
a
telegram
most
likely
we
see
each
other
again
until
we
meet
at
charing
cross
i
hope
it
may
be
tomorrow
but
thursday
is
the
latest
so
patty
took
her
departure
tripping
briskly
homeward
as
for
hilliard
he
returned
to
his
and
was
busy
for
some
time
with
the
pencilling
of
computations
in
english
and
french
money
towards
midnight
he
walked
as
far
as
high
street
and
looked
at
the
windows
above
the
all
was
dark
he
rose
very
early
next
morning
and
as
drew
near
he
walked
about
the
street
in
agonies
of
suspense
he
watched
the
from
house
to
house
followed
him
up
and
saw
him
pass
the
number
at
which
he
felt
assured
that
he
would
deliver
a
letter
in
frenzy
of
disappointment
a
fierce
oath
burst
from
his
lips
that
what
comes
of
trusting
a
woman
she
is
going
to
cheat
me
she
has
gained
her
end
and
will
put
me
off
with
excuses
but
perhaps
a
telegram
would
come
he
made
a
pretence
of
breakfasting
and
paced
his
room
for
an
hour
like
a
caged
animal
when
the
monotony
of
circulating
movement
had
all
but
stupefied
him
he
was
awakened
by
a
double
postman
knock
at
the
front
door
the
signal
that
announces
a
telegram
again
from
patty
and
again
a
request
that
he
would
come
to
the
shop
at
just
as
i
foresaw
excuses
postponement
what
woman
ever
had
the
sense
of
honour
to
get
through
the
morning
he
drank
an
occupation
suggested
by
the
heat
of
the
day
which
blazed
cloudless
the
liquor
did
not
cheer
him
but
inspired
a
sullen
courage
a
reckless
resolve
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
presented
himself
before
patty
ringrose
she
ca
go
said
patty
with
an
air
of
concern
you
were
quite
right
she
is
really
has
she
gone
out
no
she
upstairs
lying
on
the
bed
she
says
she
has
a
dreadful
headache
and
if
you
saw
her
you
believe
it
she
looks
shocking
the
second
night
she
has
closed
her
eyes
a
savage
jealousy
was
burning
hilliard
vitals
he
had
tried
to
make
light
of
the
connection
between
eve
and
that
unknown
man
even
after
her
extraordinary
request
for
money
which
all
but
confessedly
she
wanted
on
his
account
he
had
blurred
the
significance
of
such
a
situation
persuading
himself
that
neither
was
eve
capable
of
a
great
passion
nor
the
man
he
had
seen
able
to
inspire
one
now
he
rushed
to
the
conviction
that
eve
had
fooled
him
with
a
falsehood
tell
her
this
he
glared
at
patty
with
eyes
which
made
the
girl
shrink
in
alarm
if
she
is
at
charing
cross
station
by
a
quarter
to
eleven
there
an
end
of
it
i
shall
be
there
and
shall
go
on
without
her
it
her
only
chance
but
if
she
really
then
it
her
misfortune
she
must
suffer
for
it
she
goes
or
not
at
all
can
you
make
her
understand
that
i
tell
her
listen
patty
if
you
bring
her
safe
to
the
station
you
shall
have
a
note
to
buy
what
you
like
in
paris
the
girl
reddened
half
in
delight
half
in
shame
i
do
want
it
she
shall
come
very
well
till
or
for
good
no
no
she
shall
come
he
was
drenched
in
perspiration
yet
walked
for
a
mile
or
two
at
his
topmost
speed
then
a
consuming
thirst
drove
him
into
the
nearest
place
where
drink
was
sold
at
six
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
eaten
since
breakfast
he
dined
extravagantly
and
afterwards
fell
asleep
in
the
of
the
restaurant
a
waiter
with
difficulty
aroused
him
and
persuaded
him
to
try
the
effect
of
the
evening
air
an
hour
later
he
sank
in
exhaustion
on
one
of
the
benches
near
the
river
and
there
slept
profoundly
until
stirred
by
a
policeman
what
the
time
was
his
inquiry
as
he
looked
up
at
the
starry
sky
he
felt
for
his
watch
but
no
watch
was
discoverable
together
with
the
gold
chain
it
had
disappeared
damnation
someone
has
robbed
me
the
policeman
was
sympathetic
but
reproachful
why
do
you
go
to
sleep
on
the
embankment
at
this
time
of
night
lost
any
money
yes
his
money
too
had
flown
luckily
only
a
small
sum
it
was
for
the
loss
of
his
watch
and
chain
that
he
grieved
they
had
been
worn
for
years
by
his
father
and
on
that
account
had
a
far
higher
value
for
him
than
was
represented
by
their
mere
cost
as
a
matter
of
form
he
supplied
the
police
with
information
concerning
the
theft
of
recovery
there
could
be
little
hope
thoroughly
awakened
and
sober
he
walked
across
london
to
gower
place
arriving
in
the
light
of
dawn
too
spiritless
to
take
off
his
clothing
he
lay
upon
the
bed
and
through
the
open
window
watched
a
great
cloud
that
grew
rosy
above
the
opposite
houses
would
eve
be
at
the
place
of
meeting
today
it
seemed
to
him
totally
indifferent
whether
she
came
or
not
nay
he
all
but
hoped
that
she
would
not
he
had
been
guilty
of
prodigious
folly
the
girl
belonged
to
another
man
and
even
had
it
not
been
so
what
was
the
use
of
flinging
away
his
money
at
this
rate
did
he
look
for
any
reward
correspondent
to
the
sacrifice
she
would
never
love
him
and
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
complete
the
work
he
had
begun
by
freeing
her
completely
from
harsh
circumstances
setting
her
in
a
path
of
secure
and
pleasant
life
but
she
would
not
come
and
so
much
the
better
with
only
himself
to
provide
for
he
had
still
money
enough
to
travel
far
he
would
see
something
of
the
great
world
and
leave
his
future
to
destiny
he
dozed
for
an
hour
or
two
whilst
he
was
at
breakfast
a
letter
arrived
for
him
he
did
not
know
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
but
it
must
be
eve
yes
she
wrote
a
couple
of
lines
i
will
be
at
the
station
at
a
quarter
to
e
chapter
xiv
one
travelling
bag
was
all
he
carried
some
purchases
that
he
had
made
in
london
especially
the
great
work
on
french
cathedrals
were
already
despatched
to
birmingham
to
lie
in
the
care
of
robert
narramore
he
reached
charing
cross
half
an
hour
before
and
waited
at
the
entrance
several
cabs
that
drove
up
stirred
his
expectation
only
to
disappoint
him
he
was
again
in
an
anguish
of
fear
lest
eve
should
not
come
a
cab
arrived
with
two
boxes
of
modest
appearance
he
stepped
forward
and
saw
the
girls
faces
between
him
and
eve
not
a
word
passed
they
avoided
each
other
look
patty
excited
and
confused
shook
hands
with
him
go
on
to
the
platform
he
said
i
see
after
everything
this
is
all
the
luggage
yes
one
box
is
mine
and
one
eve
i
had
to
face
it
out
with
the
people
at
home
she
added
between
laughing
and
crying
they
think
i
going
to
the
seaside
to
stay
with
eve
till
she
gets
better
i
never
told
so
many
fibs
in
my
life
uncle
stormed
at
me
but
i
care
all
right
go
on
to
the
platform
eve
was
already
walking
in
that
direction
undeniably
she
looked
ill
her
step
was
languid
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
hilliard
when
he
had
taken
tickets
and
booked
the
luggage
through
to
paris
approached
his
travelling
companions
seeing
him
eve
turned
away
i
shall
go
in
a
smoking
compartment
he
said
to
patty
you
had
better
take
your
tickets
but
when
shall
we
see
you
again
oh
at
dover
of
course
will
it
be
rough
do
you
think
i
do
wish
eve
would
talk
i
ca
get
a
word
out
of
her
it
makes
it
all
so
miserable
when
we
might
be
enjoying
ourselves
do
trouble
leave
her
to
herself
i
get
you
some
papers
on
returning
from
the
bookstall
he
slipped
loose
silver
into
hands
use
that
if
you
want
anything
on
the
journey
and
i
have
forgot
my
promise
nonsense
go
and
take
your
places

minutes
to
wait
he
watched
them
as
they
passed
the
harrier
neither
of
the
girls
was
dressed
very
suitably
for
travelling
but
eve
costume
resembled
that
of
a
lady
while
patty
might
suggest
that
she
was
a
as
if
to
confirm
this
distinction
patty
had
burdened
herself
with
several
small
articles
whereas
her
friend
carried
only
a
sunshade
they
disappeared
among
people
upon
the
platform
in
a
few
minutes
hilliard
followed
glanced
along
the
carriages
till
he
saw
where
the
girls
were
seated
and
took
his
own
place
he
wore
a
suit
which
had
been
new
on
his
first
arrival
in
london
good
enough
in
quality
and
cut
to
give
his
features
the
full
value
of
their
intelligence
a
brown
felt
hat
a
russet
necktie
a
white
flannel
shirt
finding
himself
with
a
talkative
neighbour
in
the
carriage
he
chatted
freely
as
soon
as
the
train
had
started
he
lit
his
pipe
and
tasted
the
tobacco
with
more
relish
than
for
a
long
time
on
board
the
steamer
eve
kept
below
from
first
to
last
patty
walked
the
deck
with
hilliard
and
vastly
to
her
astonishment
achieved
the
voyage
without
serious
discomfort
hilliard
himself
with
the
sea
wind
in
his
nostrils
recovered
that
temper
of
buoyant
satisfaction
which
had
accompanied
his
first
escape
from
london
he
despised
the
weak
misgivings
and
sordid
calculations
of
yesterday
here
he
was
on
a
channel
steamer
bearing
away
from
disgrace
and
wretchedness
the
woman
whom
his
heart
desired
wild
as
the
project
had
seemed
to
him
when
first
he
conceived
it
he
had
put
it
into
execution
the
moment
was
worth
living
for
whatever
the
future
might
keep
in
store
for
him
of
dreary
toilsome
colourless
existence
the
retrospect
would
always
show
him
this
patch
of
purple
a
memory
precious
beyond
all
the
possible
results
of
prudence
and
narrow
the
little
by
his
side
entertained
him
with
the
flow
of
her
chatter
it
had
the
advantage
of
making
him
feel
a
travelled
man
i
did
cross
this
way
when
i
came
before
he
explained
to
her
from
newhaven
it
a
much
longer
voyage
you
like
the
sea
then
i
chose
it
because
it
was
cheaper
that
all
yet
you
so
extravagant
now
remarked
patty
with
eyes
that
confessed
admiration
of
this
quality
oh
because
i
am
rich
he
answered
gaily
money
is
nothing
to
me
are
you
really
rich
eve
said
you
were
did
she
i
do
mean
she
said
it
in
a
disagreeable
way
it
was
last
night
she
thought
you
were
wasting
your
money
upon
us
if
i
choose
to
waste
it
why
not
is
there
a
pleasure
in
doing
as
you
like
oh
of
course
there
is
patty
assented
i
only
wish
i
had
the
chance
but
it
awfully
jolly
this
who
have
thought
a
week
ago
that
i
should
be
going
to
paris
i
have
a
feeling
all
the
time
that
i
shall
wake
up
and
find
i
been
dreaming
suppose
you
go
down
and
see
whether
eve
wants
anything
you
say
i
sent
you
from
calais
to
paris
he
again
travelled
apart
from
the
girls
fatigue
overcame
him
and
for
the
last
hour
or
two
he
slept
with
the
result
that
on
alighting
at
the
gare
du
nord
he
experienced
a
decided
failure
of
spirits
happily
there
was
nothing
before
him
but
to
carry
out
a
plan
already
elaborated
with
the
aid
of
his
he
had
selected
an
hotel
which
seemed
suitable
for
the
girls
one
where
english
was
spoken
and
thither
he
drove
with
them
from
the
station
the
choice
of
their
rooms
and
the
settlement
of
details
took
only
a
few
minutes
then
for
almost
the
first
time
since
leaving
charing
cross
he
spoke
to
eve
patty
will
do
everything
she
can
for
you
he
said
i
shall
be
not
very
far
away
and
you
can
always
send
me
a
message
if
you
wish
morning
i
shall
come
at
about
ten
to
ask
how
you
are
nothing
more
than
that
unless
you
care
to
go
anywhere
the
only
reply
was
thank
you
in
a
weary
tone
and
so
having
taken
his
leave
he
set
forth
to
discover
a
considerably
less
expensive
lodging
for
himself
in
this
after
his
earlier
acquaintance
with
paris
he
had
no
difficulty
by
eight
his
business
was
done
and
he
sat
down
to
dinner
at
a
cheap
restaurant
a
headache
spoilt
his
enjoyment
of
the
meal
after
a
brief
ramble
about
the
streets
he
went
home
and
got
into
a
bed
which
was
rather
too
short
for
him
but
otherwise
promised
sufficient
comfort
the
first
thing
that
came
into
his
mind
when
he
awoke
next
morning
was
that
he
no
longer
possessed
a
watch
the
loss
cast
a
gloom
upon
him
but
he
had
slept
well
and
a
flood
of
sunshine
that
streamed
over
his
scantily
carpeted
floor
together
with
gladly
remembered
sounds
from
the
street
soon
put
him
into
an
excellent
humour
he
sprang
tip
partly
dressed
himself
and
unhasped
the
window
the
smell
of
paris
had
become
associated
in
his
mind
with
thoughts
of
liberty
a
grotesque
dance
about
the
expressed
his
joy
as
he
anticipated
patty
alone
received
him
when
he
called
upon
the
girls
she
reported
that
eve
felt
unable
to
rise
what
do
you
think
about
her
he
asked
nothing
serious
is
it
she
ca
get
rid
of
her
headache
let
her
rest
as
long
as
she
likes
are
you
comfortable
here
patty
was
in
ecstasies
with
everything
and
chattered
on
breathlessly
she
wished
to
go
out
eve
had
no
need
of
her
indeed
had
told
her
that
above
all
she
wished
to
be
left
alone
get
ready
then
said
hilliard
and
we
have
an
hour
or
two
they
walked
to
the
madeleine
and
rode
thence
on
the
top
of
a
to
the
bastille
by
this
time
patty
had
come
to
regard
her
strange
companion
in
a
sort
of
brotherly
light
no
restraint
whatever
appeared
in
her
conversation
with
him
eve
she
told
him
had
talked
french
with
the
chambermaid
and
i
fancy
it
was
something
she
did
want
to
understand
why
should
you
think
so
oh
something
in
the
way
the
girl
looked
at
me
no
no
you
were
mistaken
she
only
wanted
to
show
that
she
knew
some
french
but
hilliard
wondered
whether
patty
could
be
right
was
it
not
possible
that
eve
had
gratified
her
vanity
by
representing
her
friend
as
a
servant
a
yet
why
should
he
attribute
such
a
fault
to
her
it
was
an
odd
thing
that
he
constantly
regarded
eve
in
the
least
favourable
light
giving
weight
to
all
the
ill
he
conjectured
in
her
and
minimising
those
features
of
her
character
which
at
the
beginning
he
had
been
prepared
to
observe
with
sympathy
and
admiration
for
a
man
in
love
his
reflections
followed
a
very
unwonted
course
and
indeed
he
had
never
regarded
his
love
as
of
very
high
or
pure
quality
it
was
something
that
possessed
him
and
constrained
him
by
no
means
a
source
of
elevating
emotion
do
you
like
eve
he
asked
abruptly
disregarding
some
trivial
question
patty
had
put
to
him
like
her
of
course
i
do
and
do
you
like
her
why
ah
i
do
know
because
i
do
and
she
laughed
foolishly
does
eve
like
hilliard
continued
i
think
she
does
else
i
do
see
why
she
kept
up
with
me
has
she
ever
done
you
any
kindness
i
sure
i
do
know
nothing
particular
she
never
gave
anything
if
you
mean
that
but
she
has
paid
for
me
at
theatres
and
so
on
hilliard
quitted
the
subject
if
you
like
to
go
out
alone
he
told
her
before
they
parted
no
reason
why
you
should
just
as
you
do
in
london
remember
the
way
back
that
all
and
do
be
out
late
and
you
want
some
french
money
but
i
do
understand
it
and
how
can
i
buy
anything
when
i
speak
a
word
all
the
same
take
that
and
keep
it
till
you
are
able
to
make
use
of
it
it
what
i
promised
you
patty
drew
back
her
hand
but
her
objections
were
not
difficult
to
overcome
i
dare
say
hilliard
continued
eve
does
understand
the
money
much
better
than
you
do
but
she
soon
be
well
enough
to
talk
and
then
i
shall
explain
everything
to
her
on
this
piece
of
paper
is
my
address
please
let
eve
have
it
i
shall
call
morning
again
he
did
so
and
this
time
found
eve
as
well
as
her
companion
ready
to
go
out
no
remark
or
inquiry
concerning
her
health
passed
his
lips
he
saw
that
she
was
recovering
from
the
crisis
she
had
passed
through
whatever
its
real
nature
eve
shook
hands
with
him
and
smiled
though
as
if
discharging
an
obligation
can
you
spare
time
to
show
us
something
of
paris
she
asked
i
am
your
official
guide
make
use
of
me
whenever
it
pleases
you
i
do
feel
able
to
go
very
far
is
there
some
place
where
we
could
sit
down
in
the
open
air
a
carriage
was
summoned
and
they
drove
to
the
fields
elysian
eve
benefited
by
the
morning
thus
spent
she
left
to
patty
most
of
the
conversation
but
occasionally
made
inquiries
and
began
to
regard
things
with
a
healthy
interest
the
next
day
they
all
visited
the
louvre
for
a
light
rain
was
falling
and
here
hilliard
found
an
opportunity
of
private
talk
with
eve
they
sat
together
whilst
patty
who
cared
little
for
pictures
looked
out
of
a
window
at
the
seine
do
you
like
the
hotel
i
chose
he
began
everything
is
very
nice
and
you
are
not
sorry
to
be
here
not
in
one
way
in
another
i
ca
understand
how
i
come
to
be
here
at
all
your
physician
has
ordered
it
yes
so
i
suppose
it
all
right
there
one
thing
i
obliged
to
speak
of
do
you
understand
french
money
eve
averted
her
face
and
spoke
after
a
slight
delay
i
can
easily
learn
yes
you
shall
take
this
paris
guide
home
with
you
you
find
all
information
of
that
sort
in
it
and
i
shall
give
you
an
envelope
containing
money
just
for
your
private
use
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
charges
at
the
hotel
i
brought
it
on
myself
but
i
feel
more
ashamed
than
i
can
tell
you
if
you
tried
to
tell
me
i
should
listen
what
you
have
to
do
now
is
to
get
well
very
soon
you
and
patty
will
be
able
to
find
your
way
about
together
then
i
shall
only
come
with
you
when
you
choose
to
invite
me
you
have
my
address
he
rose
and
broke
off
the
dialogue
for
a
week
or
more
eve
behaviour
in
his
company
underwent
little
change
in
health
she
decidedly
improved
but
hilliard
always
found
her
reserved
coldly
amicable
with
an
occasional
suggestion
of
forced
humility
which
he
much
disliked
from
patty
he
learnt
that
she
went
about
a
good
deal
and
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
we
do
always
go
together
said
the
girl
yesterday
and
the
day
before
eve
was
away
by
herself
all
the
afternoon
of
course
she
can
get
on
all
right
with
her
french
she
takes
to
paris
as
if
she
lived
here
for
years
on
the
day
after
hilliard
received
a
postcard
in
which
eve
asked
him
to
be
in
a
certain
room
of
the
louvre
at
twelve
he
kept
the
appointment
and
found
eve
awaiting
him
alone
i
wanted
to
ask
whether
you
would
mind
if
we
left
the
hotel
and
went
to
live
at
another
place
he
heard
her
with
surprise
you
are
not
comfortable
quite
but
i
have
been
to
see
my
friend
mdlle
roche
you
remember
and
she
has
shown
me
how
we
can
live
very
comfortably
at
a
quarter
of
what
it
costs
now
in
the
same
house
where
she
has
a
room
i
should
like
to
change
if
you
let
me
pooh
you
not
to
think
of
the
cost
whether
i
am
to
or
not
i
do
and
ca
help
myself
i
know
the
hotel
is
fearfully
expensive
and
i
shall
like
the
other
place
much
better
miss
roche
is
a
very
nice
girl
and
she
was
glad
to
see
me
and
if
near
her
i
shall
get
all
sorts
of
advantages
in
french
and
so
on
hilliard
wondered
what
accounts
of
herself
eve
had
rendered
to
the
parisienne
but
he
did
not
venture
to
ask
will
patty
like
it
as
well
just
as
well
miss
roche
speaks
english
you
know
and
they
get
on
very
well
together
where
is
the
place
rather
far
off
towards
the
jardin
des
plantes
but
i
do
think
that
would
matter
would
it
i
leave
it
entirely
to
you
thank
you
she
answered
with
that
intonation
he
did
not
like
of
course
if
you
would
like
to
meet
miss
roche
you
can
we
think
about
it
it
enough
that
she
an
old
friend
of
yours
chapter
xv
when
this
change
had
been
made
eve
seemed
to
throw
off
a
burden
she
met
hilliard
with
something
like
the
ease
of
manner
the
frank
friendliness
which
marked
her
best
moods
in
their
earlier
intercourse
at
a
restaurant
dinner
to
which
he
persuaded
her
in
company
with
patty
she
was
ready
in
cheerful
talk
and
an
expedition
to
versailles
some
days
after
showed
her
radiant
with
the
joy
of
sunshine
and
movement
hilliard
could
not
but
wonder
at
the
success
of
his
prescription
he
did
not
visit
the
girls
in
their
new
abode
and
nothing
more
was
said
of
his
making
the
acquaintance
of
mdlle
roche
meetings
were
appointed
by
always
in
patty
hand
if
the
initiative
were
female
they
took
place
three
or
four
times
a
week
as
it
was
now
necessary
for
eve
to
make
payments
on
her
own
account
hilliard
despatched
to
her
by
post
a
remittance
in
paper
money
and
of
this
no
word
passed
between
them
three
weeks
later
he
again
posted
the
same
sum
on
the
morrow
they
went
by
river
to
st
cloud
it
was
always
a
trio
hilliard
never
making
any
other
proposal
and
the
afforded
eve
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
her
generous
friend
apart
i
do
want
this
money
she
said
giving
him
an
envelope
what
you
sent
before
is
anything
like
finished
there
enough
for
a
month
more
keep
it
all
the
same
i
wo
have
any
pinching
there
nothing
of
the
kind
if
i
do
have
my
way
in
this
i
shall
go
back
to
london
he
put
the
envelope
in
his
pocket
and
stood
silent
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
river
bank
how
long
do
you
intend
us
to
stay
asked
eve
as
long
as
you
find
pleasure
here
and
what
am
i
to
do
afterwards
he
glanced
at
her
a
holiday
must
come
to
an
end
she
added
trying
but
without
success
to
meet
his
look
i
have
given
any
thought
to
that
said
hilliard
carelessly
there
plenty
of
time
it
will
be
fine
weather
for
many
weeks
yet
but
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
i
should
be
crazy
if
i
did
tell
me
your
thoughts
then
should
you
be
satisfied
if
i
got
a
place
at
birmingham
there
again
was
the
note
of
it
irritated
the
listener
why
do
you
put
it
in
that
way
there
no
question
of
what
satisfies
me
but
of
what
is
good
for
you
then
i
think
it
had
better
be
birmingham
very
well
it
understood
that
when
we
leave
paris
we
go
there
a
silence
then
eve
asked
abruptly
you
will
go
as
well
yes
i
shall
go
back
and
what
becomes
of
your
determination
to
enjoy
life
as
long
as
you
can
i
carrying
it
out
i
shall
go
back
satisfied
at
all
events
and
return
to
your
old
work
i
do
know
it
depends
on
all
sorts
of
things
we
wo
talk
of
it
just
yet
patty
approached
and
hilliard
turned
to
her
with
a
bright
jesting
face
midway
in
august
on
his
return
home
one
afternoon
the
concierge
let
him
know
that
two
english
gentlemen
had
been
inquiring
for
him
one
of
them
had
left
a
card
with
surprise
and
pleasure
hilliard
read
the
name
of
robert
narramore
and
beneath
it
written
in
pencil
an
invitation
to
dine
that
evening
at
a
certain
hotel
in
the
rue
de
provence
as
usual
narramore
had
neglected
the
duties
of
a
correspondent
this
was
the
first
announcement
of
his
intention
to
be
in
paris
who
the
second
man
might
be
hilliard
could
not
conjecture
he
arrived
at
the
hotel
and
found
narramore
in
company
with
a
man
of
about
the
same
age
his
name
birching
to
hilliard
a
stranger
they
had
reached
paris
this
morning
and
would
remain
only
for
a
day
or
two
as
their
purpose
was
towards
the
alps
i
could
stand
this
heat
remarked
narramore
who
in
the
very
lightest
of
tourist
garbs
sprawled
upon
a
divan
and
drank
something
iced
out
of
a
tall
tumbler
we
should
have
stopped
here
at
all
if
it
had
been
for
you
the
idea
is
that
you
should
go
on
with
us
ca
impossible
why
what
are
you
doing
here
besides
roasting
eating
and
drinking
just
what
suits
my
digestion
you
look
pretty
fit
a
jolly
sight
better
than
when
we
met
last
all
the
same
you
will
go
on
with
us
we
wo
argue
it
now
wait
till
afterwards
at
table
narramore
mentioned
that
his
friend
birching
was
an
architect
just
what
this
fellow
ought
to
have
been
he
said
indicating
hilliard
architecture
is
his
hobby
i
believe
he
could
sit
down
and
draw
to
scale
a
front
elevation
of
any
great
cathedral
in
europe
could
you
hilliard
laughing
the
joke
aside
hilliard
looked
with
interest
at
birching
and
began
to
talk
with
him
the
three
young
men
consumed
a
good
deal
of
wine
and
after
dinner
strolled
about
the
streets
until
fatigue
and
thirst
brought
them
to
a
pause
at
a
cafe
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
birching
presently
moved
apart
to
reach
a
newspaper
and
remained
out
of
earshot
while
narramore
talked
with
his
other
friend
what
going
on
he
began
what
are
you
doing
here
seriously
i
want
you
to
go
along
with
us
birching
is
a
very
good
sort
of
chap
but
just
a
trifle
heavy
takes
things
rather
solemnly
for
such
hot
weather
is
it
the
expense
hang
it
you
and
i
know
each
other
well
enough
and
thanks
to
my
old
uncle
never
mind
that
old
boy
interposed
hilliard
how
long
are
you
going
for
i
ca
very
well
be
away
for
more
than
three
weeks
the
brass
bedsteads
you
know
hilliard
agreed
to
join
in
the
tour
that
right
i
been
looking
forward
to
it
said
his
friend
heartily
and
now
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
are
you
alone
here
then
what
the
deuce
do
you
do
with
yourself
chiefly
meditate
you
the
rummest
fellow
i
ever
knew
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
hang
it
what
with
hot
weather
and
brass
bedsteads
and
this
and
that
now
what
you
going
to
do
your
money
wo
last
for
ever
have
you
any
projects
it
was
no
good
talking
about
it
before
you
left
dudley
i
saw
that
you
were
all
but
fit
for
a
lunatic
asylum
and
no
wonder
but
you
pulled
round
i
see
never
saw
you
looking
in
such
condition
what
is
to
be
the
next
move
i
have
no
idea
well
now
have
this
fellow
birching
is
partner
with
his
brother
in
brum
and
they
tolerably
flourishing
i
thought
of
you
ever
since
i
came
to
know
him
i
think
it
was
chiefly
on
your
account
that
i
got
thick
with
him
though
there
was
another
reason
i
tell
you
about
that
some
time
now
why
should
you
go
into
their
office
could
you
manage
to
pay
a
small
premium
i
believe
i
could
square
it
with
them
i
have
said
anything
i
never
hurry
like
things
to
ripen
naturally
suppose
you
saw
your
way
in
a
year
or
two
to
make
only
as
much
in
an
architect
office
as
you
did
in
that
would
it
be
worth
while
hilliard
mused
already
he
had
a
flush
on
his
cheek
but
his
eyes
sensibly
brightened
yes
he
said
at
length
with
deliberation
it
would
be
worth
while
so
i
should
think
well
wait
till
you
got
to
be
a
bit
chummy
with
birching
i
think
you
suit
each
other
let
him
see
that
you
do
really
know
something
about
architecture
there
be
plenty
of
chances
hilliard
still
musing
repeated
with
mechanical
emphasis
yes
it
would
be
worth
while
then
narramore
called
to
birching
and
the
talk
became
general
again
the
next
morning
they
drove
about
paris
all
together
narramore
though
it
was
his
first
visit
to
the
city
declined
to
see
anything
which
demanded
exertion
and
the
necessity
for
quenching
his
thirst
recurred
with
great
frequency
early
in
the
afternoon
he
proposed
that
they
should
leave
paris
that
very
evening
i
want
to
see
a
mountain
with
snow
on
it
we
bound
to
travel
by
night
and
another
day
of
this
would
settle
me
any
objection
birching
the
architect
agreed
and
were
consulted
hilliard
drove
home
to
pack
when
this
was
finished
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
dear
miss
madeley
my
friend
narramore
is
here
and
has
persuaded
me
to
go
to
switzerland
with
him
i
shall
be
away
for
a
week
or
two
and
will
let
you
hear
from
me
in
the
meantime
narramore
says
i
am
looking
vastly
better
and
it
is
you
i
have
to
thank
for
this
without
you
my
attempts
at
life
would
have
been
a
poor
business
we
start
in
an
hour
or
two
yours
ever
maurice
hilliard
chapter
xvi
he
was
absent
for
full
three
weeks
and
arrived
with
his
friends
at
the
gare
de
lyon
early
one
morning
of
september
narramore
and
the
architect
delayed
only
for
a
meal
and
pursued
their
journey
homeward
hilliard
returned
to
his
old
quarters
despatched
a
asking
eve
and
patty
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
and
thereupon
went
to
bed
where
for
some
eight
hours
he
slept
the
sleep
of
healthy
fatigue
the
place
he
had
appointed
for
meeting
with
the
girls
was
at
the
foot
of
the
boulevard
michel
eve
came
alone
and
where
patty
he
asked
grasping
her
hand
heartily
in
return
for
the
smile
of
unfeigned
pleasure
with
which
she
welcomed
him
ah
where
indeed
getting
near
to
charing
cross
by
now
i
think
she
has
gone
back
went
this
very
morning
before
i
had
your
card
let
us
get
out
of
the
way
of
people
she
has
been
dreadfully
about
a
fortnight
ago
a
mysterious
letter
came
for
her
she
hid
it
away
from
me
a
few
days
after
another
came
and
she
shut
herself
up
for
a
long
time
and
when
she
came
out
again
i
saw
she
had
been
crying
then
we
talked
it
over
she
had
written
to
dally
and
got
an
answer
that
made
her
miserable
that
was
the
letter
she
wrote
again
and
had
a
reply
that
made
her
still
more
wretched
and
that
was
the
two
or
three
more
came
and
yesterday
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
then
she
has
gone
home
to
make
it
up
with
him
of
course
he
declared
that
she
has
utterly
lost
her
character
and
that
no
honest
man
could
have
anything
more
to
say
to
her
i
wonder
if
they
are
married
in
a
few
weeks
time
hilliard
laughed
i
was
to
beg
you
on
my
knees
to
forgive
her
pursued
eve
but
i
ca
very
well
do
that
in
the
middle
of
the
street
can
i
really
she
thinks
she
has
behaved
disgracefully
to
you
she
would
write
a
letter
she
was
ashamed
him
to
forget
all
about
me
she
kept
saying
good
little
girl
and
what
sort
of
a
husband
will
this
fellow
dally
make
her
no
worse
than
husbands
in
general
i
dare
say
but
how
well
you
look
how
you
must
have
been
enjoying
yourself
i
can
say
exactly
the
same
about
you
oh
but
you
are
sunburnt
and
look
quite
a
different
man
and
you
have
an
exquisite
colour
in
your
cheeks
and
eyes
twice
as
bright
as
they
used
to
be
and
one
would
think
you
had
never
known
a
care
i
feel
almost
like
that
said
eve
laughing
he
tried
to
meet
her
eyes
she
eluded
him
i
have
an
alpine
hunger
where
shall
we
dine
the
point
called
for
no
long
discussion
and
presently
they
were
seated
in
the
cool
restaurant
whilst
he
nibbled
an
olive
hilliard
ran
over
the
story
of
his
swiss
tour
if
only
had
been
there
it
was
the
one
thing
lacking
you
would
have
enjoyed
yourself
half
so
much
you
amused
me
by
your
description
of
narramore
in
the
letter
from
geneva
the
laziest
rascal
born
but
the
the
easiest
to
live
with
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
i
like
him
better
than
ever
of
course
he
is
improved
by
coming
in
for
money
who
would
be
that
has
any
good
in
him
at
all
but
it
amazes
me
that
he
can
be
content
to
go
back
to
birmingham
and
his
brass
bedsteads
sheer
lack
of
energy
i
suppose
he
grow
dreadfully
fat
i
fear
and
by
when
he
becomes
really
a
rich
man
it
awful
to
think
of
eve
asked
many
questions
about
narramore
his
image
gave
mirthful
occupation
to
her
fancy
the
dinner
went
merrily
on
and
when
the
black
coffee
was
set
before
them
why
not
have
it
outside
said
eve
you
would
like
to
smoke
i
know
hilliard
assented
and
they
seated
themselves
under
the
awning
the
boulevard
glowed
in
a
golden
light
of
sunset
the
sound
of
its
traffic
was
subdued
to
a
lulling
rhythm
there
a
month
yet
before
the
leaves
will
begin
to
fall
murmured
the
young
man
when
he
had
smoked
awhile
in
silence
yes
was
the
answer
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
little
summer
still
in
birmingham
do
you
wish
to
go
i
shall
go
or
the
day
after
eve
replied
quietly
then
again
there
came
silence
something
has
been
proposed
to
me
said
hilliard
at
length
leaning
forward
with
his
elbows
upon
the
table
i
mentioned
that
our
friend
birching
is
an
architect
he
in
partnership
with
his
brother
a
much
older
man
well
they
nave
offered
to
take
me
into
their
office
if
i
pay
a
premium
of
fifty
guineas
as
soon
as
i
can
qualify
myself
to
be
of
use
to
them
they
give
me
a
salary
and
i
shall
have
the
chance
of
eventually
doing
much
better
than
i
ever
could
at
the
old
grind
where
in
fact
i
had
no
prospect
whatever
that
very
good
news
eve
remarked
gazing
across
the
street
you
think
i
ought
to
accept
i
suppose
you
can
pay
the
fifty
guineas
and
still
leave
yourself
enough
to
live
upon
enough
till
i
earn
something
hilliard
answered
with
a
smile
then
i
should
think
there
no
doubt
the
question
is
this
are
you
perfectly
willing
to
go
back
to
birmingham
i
to
go
you
feel
quite
restored
to
health
i
was
never
so
well
in
my
life
hilliard
looked
into
her
face
and
could
easily
believe
that
she
spoke
the
truth
his
memory
would
no
longer
recall
the
photograph
in
mrs
brewer
album
the
living
eve
with
her
progressive
changes
of
countenance
had
obliterated
that
pale
image
of
her
bygone
self
he
saw
her
now
as
a
beautiful
woman
mysterious
to
him
still
in
many
respects
yet
familiar
as
though
they
had
been
friends
for
years
then
whatever
life
is
before
me
he
said
i
shall
have
done
thing
that
is
worth
doing
perhaps
if
everyone
life
is
worth
saving
eve
answered
in
a
voice
just
audible
everyone
is
not
but
yours
was
two
men
who
had
been
sitting
not
far
from
them
rose
and
walked
away
as
if
more
at
her
ease
for
this
secession
eve
looked
at
her
companion
and
said
in
a
tone
of
intimacy
how
i
must
have
puzzled
you
when
you
first
saw
me
in
london
he
answered
softly
to
be
sure
you
did
and
the
thought
of
it
puzzles
me
still
oh
but
ca
you
understand
no
of
course
you
ca
i
have
told
you
so
little
just
give
me
an
idea
of
what
sort
of
person
you
expected
to
find
yes
i
will
judging
from
your
portrait
and
from
what
i
was
told
of
you
i
looked
for
a
sad
solitary
girl
rather
poorly
dressed
taking
no
pleasure
going
much
to
chapel
shrinking
from
the
ordinary
world
and
you
felt
disappointed
at
first
yes
or
rather
bewildered
utterly
unable
to
understand
you
you
are
disappointed
still
she
asked
i
would
have
you
anything
but
what
you
are
still
that
other
girl
was
the
one
you
to
meet
yes
before
i
had
seen
you
it
was
the
sort
of
resemblance
between
her
life
and
my
own
i
thought
of
sympathy
between
us
and
the
face
of
the
portrait
but
i
see
better
things
in
the
face
that
is
looking
at
me
now
do
be
quite
sure
of
that
yes
perhaps
it
better
to
be
healthy
and
enjoy
life
than
and
hopeless
the
strange
thing
is
that
you
were
right
you
fancied
me
just
the
kind
of
a
girl
i
was
sad
and
solitary
and
shrinking
from
people
true
enough
and
i
went
to
chapel
and
got
comfort
from
it
as
i
hope
to
do
again
do
think
that
i
have
no
religion
but
i
was
so
unhealthy
and
suffered
so
in
every
way
work
and
anxiety
without
cease
from
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
you
know
all
about
my
father
if
i
had
been
clever
at
figures
what
would
have
become
of
me
i
should
have
drudged
at
some
wretched
occupation
until
the
work
and
the
misery
of
everything
killed
me
hilliard
listened
intently
his
eyes
never
stirring
from
her
face
the
change
in
me
began
when
father
came
back
to
us
and
i
began
to
feel
my
freedom
then
i
wanted
to
get
away
and
to
live
by
myself
i
thought
of
london
i
told
you
how
much
i
always
thought
of
london
but
i
had
the
courage
to
go
there
in
birmingham
i
began
to
change
my
old
habits
but
more
in
what
i
thought
than
what
i
did
i
wished
to
enjoy
myself
like
other
girls
but
i
could
for
one
thing
i
thought
it
wicked
and
then
i
was
so
afraid
of
spending
a
penny
i
had
so
often
known
what
it
was
to
be
in
want
of
a
copper
to
buy
food
so
i
lived
quite
alone
sat
in
my
room
every
evening
and
read
books
you
could
hardly
believe
what
a
number
of
books
i
read
in
that
year
sometimes
i
did
go
to
bed
till
two
or
three
what
sort
of
books
i
got
them
from
the
free
library
books
of
all
kinds
not
only
novels
i
never
been
particularly
fond
of
novels
they
always
made
me
feel
my
own
lot
all
the
harder
i
never
could
understand
what
people
mean
when
they
say
that
reading
novels
takes
them
of
themselves
it
was
never
so
with
me
i
liked
travels
and
lives
of
people
and
books
about
the
stars
why
do
you
laugh
you
escaped
from
yourself
at
all
events
at
last
i
saw
an
advertisement
in
a
newspaper
a
london
paper
in
the
which
i
was
tempted
to
answer
and
i
got
an
engagement
in
london
when
the
time
came
for
starting
i
was
so
afraid
and
that
i
all
but
gave
it
up
i
should
have
done
if
i
could
have
known
what
was
before
me
the
first
year
in
london
was
all
loneliness
and
i
did
make
a
friend
and
i
starved
myself
all
to
save
money
out
of
my
pound
a
week
i
saved
several
shillings
just
because
it
was
the
habit
of
my
whole
life
to
pinch
and
pare
and
deny
myself
i
was
obliged
to
dress
decently
and
that
came
out
of
my
food
it
certain
i
must
have
a
very
good
constitution
to
have
gone
through
all
that
and
be
as
well
as
i
am
it
will
never
come
again
said
hilliard
how
can
i
be
sure
of
that
i
told
you
once
before
that
i
often
in
dread
of
the
future
it
would
be
ever
so
much
worse
after
knowing
what
it
means
to
enjoy
one
life
how
do
people
feel
who
are
quite
sure
they
can
never
want
as
long
as
they
live
i
have
tried
to
imagine
it
but
i
ca
it
would
be
too
wonderful
you
may
know
it
some
day
eve
reflected
it
was
patty
ringrose
she
continued
who
taught
me
to
take
life
more
easily
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
enjoyment
she
could
get
out
of
an
hour
or
two
of
liberty
with
sixpence
to
spend
she
did
me
good
by
laughing
at
me
and
in
the
end
i
astonished
was
it
natural
that
i
should
be
reckless
as
soon
as
i
got
the
chance
i
begin
to
understand
the
chance
came
in
this
way
one
sunday
morning
i
went
by
myself
to
hampstead
and
as
i
was
wandering
about
on
the
heath
i
kicked
against
something
it
was
a
which
i
saw
could
have
been
lying
there
very
long
i
found
it
had
been
broken
open
and
inside
it
were
a
lot
of
letters
old
letters
in
envelopes
nothing
else
the
addresses
on
the
envelopes
were
all
the
same
to
a
gentleman
living
at
hampstead
i
thought
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
go
and
inquire
for
this
address
and
i
found
it
and
rang
the
when
i
told
the
servant
what
i
wanted
it
was
a
large
house
she
asked
me
to
come
in
and
after
i
had
waited
a
little
she
took
me
into
a
library
where
a
gentleman
was
sitting
i
had
to
answer
a
good
many
questions
and
the
man
talked
rather
gruffly
to
me
when
he
had
made
a
note
of
my
name
and
where
i
lived
he
said
that
i
should
hear
from
him
and
so
i
went
away
of
course
i
hoped
to
have
a
reward
but
for
two
or
three
days
i
heard
nothing
then
when
i
was
at
business
someone
asked
to
see
me
a
man
i
did
know
he
said
he
had
come
from
mr
so
and
so
the
gentleman
at
hampstead
and
had
brought
something
for
me
four
notes
the
had
been
stolen
by
someone
with
other
things
the
night
before
i
found
it
and
the
letters
in
it
which
disappointed
the
thief
had
a
great
value
for
their
owner
all
sorts
of
inquiries
had
been
made
about
me
and
no
doubt
i
very
nearly
got
into
the
hands
of
the
police
but
it
was
all
right
and
i
had
twenty
pounds
reward
think
twenty
pounds
hilliard
nodded
i
told
no
one
about
it
not
even
patty
and
i
put
the
money
into
the
post
office
savings
bank
i
meant
it
to
stay
there
till
i
might
be
in
need
but
i
thought
of
it
day
and
night
and
only
a
fortnight
after
my
employers
shut
up
their
place
of
business
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
all
one
night
i
lay
awake
and
when
i
got
up
in
the
morning
i
felt
as
if
i
was
no
longer
my
old
self
i
saw
everything
in
a
different
way
felt
altogether
changed
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
look
for
a
new
place
but
to
take
my
money
out
of
the
post
office
i
had
more
than
pounds
there
altogether
and
spend
it
for
my
pleasure
it
was
just
as
if
something
had
enraged
me
and
i
was
bent
on
avenging
myself
all
that
day
i
walked
about
the
town
looking
at
shops
and
thinking
what
i
should
like
to
buy
but
i
only
spent
a
shilling
or
two
for
meals
the
next
day
i
bought
some
new
clothing
the
day
after
that
i
took
patty
to
the
theatre
and
astonished
her
by
my
extravagance
but
i
gave
her
no
explanation
and
to
this
day
she
does
understand
how
i
got
my
money
in
a
sort
of
way
i
enjoy
myself
for
one
thing
i
took
a
subscription
at
mudie
and
began
to
read
once
more
you
think
how
it
pleased
me
to
get
my
books
new
books
where
rich
people
do
i
changed
a
volume
about
every
other
day
i
had
so
many
hours
i
did
know
what
to
do
with
patty
was
the
only
friend
i
had
made
so
i
took
her
about
with
me
whenever
she
could
get
away
in
the
evening
yet
never
once
dined
at
a
restaurant
remarked
hilliard
laughing
there
the
difference
between
man
and
woman
my
ideas
of
extravagance
were
very
modest
after
all
hilliard
fingering
his
said
in
a
lower
voice
yet
you
have
told
me
everything
eve
looked
away
and
kept
silence
by
the
time
i
met
you
he
spoke
in
his
ordinary
tone
you
had
begun
to
grow
tired
of
it
yes
and
she
rose
we
wo
sit
here
any
longer
when
they
had
walked
for
a
few
minutes
how
long
shall
you
stay
in
paris
she
asked
wo
you
let
me
travel
with
you
i
do
whatever
you
wish
eve
answered
simply
chapter
xvii
her
accent
of
submission
did
not
affect
hilliard
as
formerly
with
a
nervous
thrill
he
felt
that
she
spoke
as
her
heart
dictated
in
his
absence
eve
had
come
to
regard
him
if
not
with
the
feeling
he
desired
with
something
that
resembled
it
he
read
the
change
in
her
eyes
as
they
walked
slowly
away
she
kept
nearer
to
him
than
of
wont
now
and
then
her
arm
touched
his
and
the
contact
gave
him
a
delicious
sensation
askance
he
observed
her
figure
its
graceful
rather
languid
movement
she
had
a
new
power
over
him
and
excited
with
a
passion
which
made
his
earlier
desires
seem
spiritless
one
day
more
of
paris
he
asked
softly
would
it
be
better
she
hesitated
in
the
objection
do
you
wish
to
break
the
journey
in
london
no
let
us
go
straight
on
then
i
do
think
we
ought
to
put
it
off
the
holiday
is
over
hilliard
nodded
with
satisfaction
an
incident
of
the
street
occupied
them
for
a
few
minutes
and
their
serious
conversation
was
only
resumed
when
they
had
crossed
to
the
south
side
of
the
river
where
they
turned
eastwards
and
went
along
the
quays
till
i
can
find
something
to
do
eve
said
at
length
i
shall
live
at
dudley
father
will
be
very
glad
to
have
me
there
he
wished
me
to
stay
longer
i
am
wondering
whether
it
is
really
necessary
for
you
to
go
back
to
your
drudgery
oh
of
course
it
is
she
answered
quickly
i
must
be
idle
the
very
worst
thing
for
me
and
how
am
i
to
live
i
have
still
plenty
of
money
said
hilliard
regarding
her
no
more
than
you
will
need
but
think
how
little
more
it
costs
for
two
than
for
one
he
spoke
in
spite
of
himself
having
purposed
no
such
suggestion
eve
quickened
her
step
no
no
no
you
have
a
struggle
before
you
you
do
know
what
and
if
it
would
make
it
easier
for
me
there
no
real
doubt
about
my
getting
on
well
enough
everything
is
doubtful
she
spoke
in
a
voice
of
agitation
we
see
a
day
before
us
we
have
arranged
everything
very
well
hilliard
was
looking
across
the
river
he
walked
more
and
more
slowly
and
turned
at
length
to
stand
by
the
parapet
his
companion
remained
apart
from
him
waiting
but
he
did
not
turn
towards
her
again
and
she
moved
to
his
side
i
know
how
ungrateful
i
must
seem
she
spoke
without
looking
at
him
i
have
no
right
to
refuse
anything
after
all
you
do
say
that
he
interrupted
impatiently
that
the
one
thing
i
shall
never
like
to
think
of
i
shall
think
of
it
always
and
be
glad
to
remember
it
come
nearer
give
me
your
hand
holding
it
he
drew
her
against
his
side
and
they
stood
in
silence
looking
upon
the
seine
now
dark
beneath
the
clouding
night
i
ca
feel
sure
of
you
fell
at
length
from
hilliard
i
promise
yes
here
now
in
paris
but
when
you
are
back
in
that
hell
what
difference
can
it
make
in
me
it
ca
change
what
i
feel
now
you
have
altered
all
my
life
my
thoughts
about
everything
when
i
look
back
i
do
know
myself
you
were
right
i
must
have
been
suffering
from
an
illness
that
affected
my
mind
it
seems
impossible
that
i
could
ever
have
done
such
things
i
ought
to
tell
you
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
everything
hilliard
spoke
no
answer
but
he
pressed
her
hand
more
tightly
in
his
own
you
knew
it
from
patty
did
you
she
told
me
as
much
as
she
knew
that
night
when
i
waited
for
you
in
high
street
she
said
you
were
in
danger
and
i
compelled
her
to
tell
all
she
could
i
in
danger
though
i
ca
understand
now
how
it
went
so
far
as
that
it
was
he
who
came
to
me
with
the
money
from
the
gentleman
at
hampstead
that
was
how
i
first
met
him
the
next
day
he
waited
for
me
when
i
came
away
from
business
it
was
the
first
time
that
anything
of
that
kind
had
happened
the
first
time
and
you
know
what
the
state
of
my
mind
was
then
but
to
the
end
i
never
felt
any
i
never
really
loved
him
we
met
and
went
to
places
together
after
my
loneliness
you
can
understand
but
i
distrusted
him
did
patty
tell
you
why
i
left
london
so
suddenly
yes
when
that
happened
i
knew
my
instinct
had
been
right
from
the
first
it
gave
me
very
little
pain
but
i
was
ashamed
and
disgusted
he
tried
to
deceive
me
in
words
he
never
spoke
of
marriage
and
from
what
i
found
out
then
i
saw
that
he
was
very
much
to
be
pitied
you
seem
to
contradict
yourself
said
hilliard
why
were
you
ashamed
and
disgusted
at
finding
myself
in
the
power
of
such
a
woman
he
married
her
when
she
was
very
young
and
i
could
imagine
the
life
he
had
led
with
her
until
he
freed
himself
a
hateful
woman
hateful
to
you
i
see
muttered
the
listener
with
something
tight
at
his
heart
not
because
i
felt
anything
like
jealousy
you
must
believe
me
i
should
never
have
spoken
if
i
had
meant
to
tell
you
the
simple
truth
again
he
pressed
her
hand
the
warmth
of
her
body
had
raised
his
blood
to
when
we
met
again
after
i
came
back
it
was
by
chance
i
refused
to
speak
to
him
but
he
followed
me
all
along
the
street
and
i
know
it
till
i
was
nearly
home
then
he
came
up
again
and
implored
me
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
i
knew
he
would
wait
for
me
again
in
high
street
so
i
had
no
choice
but
to
listen
and
then
tell
him
that
there
could
be
anything
more
between
us
and
for
all
that
he
followed
me
another
day
and
again
i
had
to
listen
to
him
hilliard
fancied
that
he
could
feel
her
heart
beat
against
his
arm
be
quick
he
said
tell
all
and
have
done
with
it
he
told
me
at
last
that
he
was
ruined
his
wife
had
brought
him
into
money
difficulties
she
ran
up
bills
that
he
was
obliged
to
pay
and
left
him
scarcely
enough
to
live
upon
and
he
had
used
money
that
was
not
his
own
he
would
have
to
give
an
account
of
it
in
a
day
or
two
he
was
trying
to
borrow
but
no
one
would
lend
him
half
what
he
needed
that
enough
hilliard
broke
in
as
her
voice
became
inaudible
no
you
ought
to
know
more
than
i
have
told
you
of
course
he
ask
me
for
money
he
had
no
idea
that
i
could
lend
him
even
a
pound
but
what
i
wish
you
to
know
is
that
he
had
spoken
to
me
again
in
the
old
way
he
said
he
had
done
wrong
when
he
first
came
to
know
me
he
begged
me
to
forgive
him
that
and
only
wanted
me
to
be
his
friend
of
course
oh
do
be
ungenerous
that
so
unlike
you
i
did
mean
it
ungenerously
in
his
position
i
should
have
done
exactly
as
he
did
say
you
believe
me
there
was
not
a
word
of
love
between
us
he
told
me
all
about
the
miseries
of
his
life
that
was
all
and
i
pitied
him
so
i
felt
he
was
so
sincere
i
believe
it
perfectly
there
was
no
excuse
for
what
i
did
how
i
had
the
courage
the
shamelessness
is
more
than
i
can
understand
now
hilliard
stirred
himself
and
tried
to
laugh
as
it
turned
out
you
could
have
done
better
well
there
an
end
of
it
come
he
walked
on
and
eve
kept
closely
beside
him
looking
up
into
his
face
i
am
sure
he
will
pay
the
money
back
she
said
presently
hang
the
money
then
he
stood
still
how
is
he
to
pay
it
back
i
mean
how
is
he
to
communicate
with
you
i
gave
him
my
address
at
dudley
again
hilliard
moved
on
why
should
it
annoy
you
eve
asked
if
ever
he
writes
to
me
i
shall
let
you
know
at
once
you
shall
see
the
letter
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
pay
his
debt
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
when
he
does
what
explanation
did
you
give
him
the
true
one
i
said
i
had
borrowed
from
a
friend
he
was
in
despair
and
could
refuse
what
i
offered
we
talk
no
more
of
it
it
was
right
to
tell
me
i
glad
now
all
over
look
at
the
moon
rising
harvest
moon
is
it
eve
turned
aside
again
and
leaned
on
the
parapet
he
lingering
apart
for
a
moment
at
length
drew
nearer
of
her
own
accord
she
put
her
hands
in
his
in
future
she
said
you
shall
know
everything
i
do
you
can
trust
me
there
will
be
no
more
secrets
yet
you
are
afraid
it
for
your
sake
you
must
be
free
for
the
next
year
or
two
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
to
work
again
i
am
well
and
strong
and
cheerful
her
eyes
drew
him
with
the
temptation
he
had
ever
yet
resisted
eve
did
not
refuse
her
lips
you
must
write
to
patty
she
said
when
they
were
at
the
place
of
parting
i
shall
have
her
new
address
in
a
day
or
two
yes
i
will
write
to
her
chapter
xviii
by
the
end
of
november
hilliard
was
well
at
work
in
the
office
of
birching
encouraged
by
his
progress
and
looking
forward
as
hopefully
as
a
not
very
sanguine
temperament
would
allow
he
lived
penuriously
and
toiled
at
professional
study
night
as
well
as
day
now
and
then
he
passed
an
evening
with
robert
narramore
who
had
moved
to
cozy
bachelor
quarters
a
little
distance
out
of
town
in
the
halesowen
direction
once
a
week
generally
on
saturday
he
saw
eve
other
society
he
had
none
nor
greatly
desired
any
but
eve
had
as
yet
found
no
employment
good
fortune
in
this
respect
seemed
to
have
deserted
her
and
at
her
meetings
with
hilliard
she
grew
fretful
over
repeated
disappointments
of
her
life
she
made
no
complaint
but
hilliard
saw
too
clearly
that
her
spirits
were
failing
beneath
a
burden
of
monotonous
dulness
that
the
healthy
glow
she
had
brought
back
in
her
cheeks
should
give
way
to
pallor
was
no
more
than
he
had
expected
but
he
watched
with
anxiety
the
return
of
mental
symptoms
which
he
had
tried
to
cheat
himself
into
believing
would
not
reappear
eve
did
not
fail
in
pleasant
smiles
in
hopeful
words
but
they
cost
her
an
effort
which
she
lacked
the
art
to
conceal
he
felt
a
coldness
in
her
divined
a
struggle
between
conscience
and
inclination
however
for
this
also
he
was
prepared
all
the
more
need
for
vigour
and
animation
on
his
own
part
hilliard
had
read
of
the
woman
who
in
the
strength
of
her
love
and
loyalty
heartens
a
man
through
all
the
labours
he
must
front
he
believed
in
her
existence
but
had
never
encountered
her
as
indeed
very
few
men
have
from
eve
he
looked
for
nothing
of
the
kind
if
she
would
permit
herself
to
rest
upon
his
sinews
that
was
all
he
desired
the
mood
of
their
last
night
in
paris
might
perchance
return
but
only
with
like
conditions
of
his
workaday
passion
she
knew
nothing
habit
of
familiarity
and
sense
of
obligation
must
supply
its
place
with
her
until
a
brightening
future
once
more
set
her
emotions
to
the
gladsome
tune
now
that
the
days
of
sun
and
warmth
were
past
it
was
difficult
to
arrange
for
a
meeting
under
circumstances
that
allowed
of
free
comfortable
colloquy
eve
declared
that
her
father
house
offered
no
sort
of
convenience
it
was
only
a
poor
cottage
and
hilliard
would
be
altogether
out
of
place
there
to
his
lodgings
she
could
not
come
of
necessity
they
had
recourse
to
public
places
in
birmingham
where
an
hour
or
two
of
talk
under
shelter
might
make
eve
journey
hither
worth
while
as
hilliard
lived
at
the
north
end
of
the
town
he
suggested
aston
hall
as
a
possible
rendezvous
and
here
they
met
early
one
saturday
afternoon
in
december
from
the
eminence
which
late
years
have
encompassed
with
a
proletarian
suburb
its
once
noble
domain
narrowed
to
the
bare
acres
of
a
stinted
breathing
ground
aston
hall
looks
forth
upon
joyless
streets
and
fuming
chimneys
a
wide
welter
of
squalid
strife
its
walls
which
bear
the
dints
of
roundhead
cannonade
are
blackened
with
smoke
its
crumbling
gateway
opening
aforetime
upon
a
stately
avenue
of
chestnuts
shakes
as
the
rushes
by
imagination
was
both
attracted
and
repelled
by
this
relic
of
what
he
deemed
a
better
age
he
enjoyed
the
antique
chambers
the
winding
staircases
the
lordly
gallery
with
its
dark
old
portraits
and
vast
fireplaces
the
nooks
where
one
could
hide
alone
and
dream
away
the
present
but
in
the
end
reality
threw
scorn
upon
such
pleasure
aston
hall
was
a
mere
architectural
relic
incongruous
and
meaningless
amid
its
surroundings
the
pathos
of
its
desecrated
dignity
made
him
wish
that
it
might
be
destroyed
and
its
place
fittingly
occupied
by
some
people
palace
brand
new
aglare
with
electric
light
ringing
to
the
latest
melodies
of
the
street
when
he
had
long
gazed
at
its
gloomy
front
the
old
champion
of
royalism
seemed
to
shrink
together
humiliated
by
time
insults
it
was
raining
when
he
met
eve
at
the
entrance
this
wo
do
were
his
first
words
you
ca
come
over
in
such
weather
as
this
if
it
had
seemed
to
be
clearing
tip
an
hour
or
two
ago
i
should
have
telegraphed
to
stop
you
oh
the
weather
is
nothing
to
me
eve
answered
with
resolute
gaiety
i
only
too
glad
of
the
change
besides
it
wo
go
on
much
longer
i
shall
get
a
place
hilliard
never
questioned
her
about
her
attempts
to
obtain
an
engagement
the
subject
was
too
disagreeable
to
him
nothing
yet
she
continued
as
they
walked
up
the
muddy
roadway
to
the
hall
but
i
know
you
do
like
to
talk
about
it
i
have
something
to
propose
how
if
i
take
a
couple
of
cheap
rooms
in
some
building
let
out
for
offices
and
put
in
a
few
sticks
of
furniture
would
you
come
to
see
me
there
he
watched
her
face
as
she
listened
to
the
suggestion
and
his
timidity
seemed
justified
by
her
expression
you
would
be
so
uncomfortable
in
such
a
place
do
trouble
we
shall
manage
to
meet
somehow
i
am
certain
to
be
living
here
before
long
even
when
you
are
he
persisted
we
shall
only
be
able
to
see
each
other
in
places
like
this
i
ca
talk
ca
say
half
the
things
i
wish
to
we
think
about
it
ah
it
warm
in
here
this
afternoon
the
guardians
of
the
hall
were
likely
to
be
troubled
with
few
visitors
eve
at
once
led
the
way
upstairs
to
a
certain
suite
of
rooms
hung
with
uninteresting
pictures
where
she
and
hilliard
had
before
this
spent
an
hour
safe
from
disturbance
she
placed
herself
in
the
recess
of
a
window
her
companion
took
a
few
steps
backward
and
forward
let
me
do
what
i
wish
he
urged
there
a
whole
long
winter
before
us
i
am
sure
i
could
find
a
couple
of
rooms
at
a
very
low
rent
and
some
old
woman
would
come
in
to
do
all
that
necessary
if
you
like
i
may
you
would
come
there
he
asked
eagerly
of
course
i
would
come
but
i
like
to
see
you
in
a
bare
comfortless
place
it
need
be
that
a
few
pounds
will
make
a
decent
sort
of
anything
to
tell
me
eve
asked
abruptly
quitting
the
subject
she
seemed
to
be
in
better
spirits
than
of
late
notwithstanding
the
evil
sky
and
hilliard
smiled
with
pleasure
as
he
regarded
her
nothing
unusual
oh
yes
i
forgetting
i
had
a
letter
from
emily
and
went
to
see
her
hilliard
had
scarcely
seen
his
quondam
since
she
became
marr
on
the
one
occasion
of
his
paying
a
call
after
his
return
from
paris
it
struck
him
that
her
husband
offered
no
very
genial
welcome
he
had
expected
this
and
willingly
kept
aloof
read
the
letter
eve
did
so
it
began
my
dear
maurice
and
ended
ever
affectionately
and
gratefully
yours
the
rest
of
its
contents
ran
thus
i
am
in
great
trouble
dreadfully
unhappy
it
would
be
such
a
kindness
if
you
would
let
me
see
you
i
ca
put
in
a
letter
what
i
want
to
say
and
i
do
hope
you
wo
refuse
to
come
friday
afternoon
at
three
would
do
if
you
can
get
away
from
business
for
once
how
i
look
back
on
the
days
when
you
used
to
come
over
from
dudley
and
have
tea
with
us
in
the
dear
little
room
do
come
of
course
said
hilliard
laughing
as
he
met
eve
surprised
look
i
knew
what
meant
i
would
much
rather
have
got
out
of
it
but
it
would
have
seemed
brutal
so
i
went
the
poor
simpleton
has
begun
to
find
that
marriage
with
one
man
is
necessarily
the
same
thing
as
marriage
with
another
in
ezra
marr
she
has
caught
a
tartar
surely
he
does
her
not
a
bit
of
it
he
is
simply
a
man
with
a
will
and
finds
it
necessary
to
teach
his
wife
her
duties
emily
knows
no
more
about
the
duties
of
life
than
her
little
girl
she
thought
she
could
play
with
a
second
husband
as
she
did
with
the
first
and
she
was
gravely
mistaken
she
complained
to
me
of
a
thousand
acts
of
tyranny
every
one
of
them
i
could
see
merely
a
piece
of
rude
commonsense
the
man
must
be
calling
himself
an
idiot
for
marrying
her
i
could
only
listen
with
a
long
face
argument
with
emily
is
out
of
the
question
and
i
shall
take
good
care
not
to
go
there
again
eve
asked
many
questions
and
approved
his
resolve
you
are
not
the
person
to
console
and
instruct
her
but
she
must
look
upon
you
as
the
best
and
wisest
of
men
i
can
understand
that
you
can
understand
poor
foolish
emily
thinking
so
put
all
the
meaning
you
like
into
my
words
said
eve
with
her
pleasantest
smile
well
i
too
have
had
a
letter
from
patty
she
is
going
to
be
married
after
all
why
i
thought
it
was
over
by
now
she
broke
it
off
less
than
a
week
before
the
day
i
wish
i
could
show
you
her
letter
but
of
course
i
must
it
very
amusing
they
had
quarrelled
about
every
conceivable
thing
all
but
one
and
this
came
up
at
last
they
were
talking
about
meals
and
dally
said
that
he
liked
a
bloater
for
breakfast
every
morning
bloater
cried
patty
i
hope
you
wo
ask
me
to
cook
it
for
you
i
ca
bear
them
very
well
if
you
ca
cook
a
bloater
you
not
the
wife
for
me
and
there
they
broke
off
for
good
and
all
which
means
for
a
month
or
two
i
suppose
impossible
to
say
but
i
have
advised
her
as
strongly
as
i
could
not
to
marry
until
she
knows
her
own
mind
better
it
is
too
bad
of
her
to
have
gone
so
far
the
poor
man
had
taken
rooms
and
all
but
furnished
them
patty
a
silly
girl
i
afraid
wants
a
strong
man
to
take
her
in
hand
like
a
good
many
other
girls
eve
paid
no
attention
to
the
smile
paris
spoilt
her
for
such
a
man
as
dally
she
got
all
sorts
of
new
ideas
and
ca
settle
down
to
the
things
that
satisfied
her
before
it
is
nice
to
think
that
perhaps
we
did
her
a
great
deal
of
harm
nonsense
nobody
was
ever
harmed
by
healthy
enjoyment
was
it
healthy
for
that
the
question
hilliard
mused
and
felt
disinclined
to
discuss
the
matter
that
is
the
only
news
i
have
for
you
said
eve
presently
had
another
letter
her
voice
arrested
hilliard
step
as
he
paced
near
her
i
had
rather
not
have
told
you
anything
about
it
but
i
promised
and
i
have
to
give
you
something
she
held
out
to
him
a
note
what
this
he
has
sent
it
he
says
he
shall
be
able
to
pay
something
every
three
months
until
he
has
paid
the
whole
debt
please
to
take
it
after
a
short
struggle
with
himself
hilliard
recovered
a
manly
bearing
it
quite
right
he
should
return
the
money
eve
but
you
must
ask
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
use
it
for
your
own
expenses
i
gave
it
to
you
and
i
ca
take
it
back
she
hesitated
her
eyes
cast
down
he
has
written
a
long
letter
there
not
a
word
in
it
i
should
be
afraid
to
show
you
will
you
read
it
just
to
satisfy
me
do
read
it
hilliard
steadily
refused
with
perfect
i
trust
you
that
enough
i
have
absolute
faith
in
you
answer
his
letter
in
the
way
you
think
best
and
never
speak
to
me
of
the
money
again
it
yours
make
what
use
of
it
you
like
then
i
shall
use
it
said
eve
after
a
pause
to
pay
for
a
lodging
in
birmingham
i
could
live
much
longer
at
home
if
i
here
i
can
get
books
out
of
the
library
and
time
wo
drag
so
and
i
shall
be
near
you
do
so
by
all
means
as
if
more
completely
to
dismiss
the
unpleasant
subject
they
walked
into
another
room
hilliard
began
to
speak
again
of
his
scheme
for
providing
a
place
where
they
could
meet
and
talk
at
their
ease
eve
now
entered
into
it
with
frank
satisfaction
have
you
said
anything
yet
to
mr
narramore
she
asked
at
length
no
i
have
never
felt
inclined
to
tell
him
of
course
i
shall
some
day
but
it
is
natural
to
me
to
talk
of
this
kind
of
thing
even
with
so
intimate
a
friend
some
men
could
keep
it
to
themselves
for
me
the
difficulty
is
to
speak
i
asked
again
because
i
have
been
thinking
might
narramore
be
able
to
help
me
to
get
work
hilliard
repelled
the
suggestion
with
strong
distaste
on
no
account
would
he
seek
his
friend
help
in
such
a
matter
and
eve
said
no
more
of
it
on
her
return
journey
to
dudley
between
eight
and
nine
she
looked
cold
and
spiritless
her
eyelids
dropped
wearily
as
she
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
with
some
papers
on
her
lap
which
hilliard
had
given
her
rain
had
ceased
and
the
weather
seemed
turning
to
frost
from
dudley
station
she
had
a
walk
of
nearly
half
an
hour
to
the
top
of
kate
hill
kate
hill
is
covered
with
an
irregular
assemblage
of
old
cottages
grimy
without
but
sometimes
as
could
be
seen
through
an
open
door
admitting
into
the
chief
room
clean
and
within
the
steep
narrow
alleys
leading
upward
were
scarce
lighted
here
and
there
glimmered
a
pale
but
on
a
black
night
such
as
this
the
windows
of
a
little
shop
and
the
occasional
gleam
from
doors
proved
very
serviceable
as
a
help
in
picking
one
path
towards
the
top
of
the
hill
there
was
no
paving
and
mud
lay
thick
indescribable
the
confusion
of
this
toilers
settlement
houses
and
workshops
tumbled
together
as
if
by
chance
the
ways
climbing
and
winding
into
all
manner
of
recesses
where
eats
prowled
stealthily
in
one
spot
silence
and
not
a
hint
of
life
in
another
children
noisily
at
play
amid
piles
of
old
metal
or
miscellaneous
rubbish
from
the
labyrinth
which
was
so
familiar
to
her
eve
issued
of
a
sudden
on
to
a
sort
of
terrace
where
the
air
blew
shrewdly
beneath
lay
cottage
roofs
and
in
front
a
limitless
gloom
which
by
daylight
would
have
been
an
extensive
northward
view
comprising
the
towns
of
bilston
and
wolverhampton
it
was
now
a
black
gulf
without
form
and
void
sputtering
fire
flames
that
leapt
out
of
nothing
and
as
suddenly
disappeared
tongues
of
yellow
or
of
crimson
quivering
lambent
seeming
to
snatch
and
devour
and
then
fall
back
in
satiety
when
a
cluster
of
these
fires
shot
forth
together
the
sky
above
became
illumined
with
a
broad
glare
which
throbbed
and
pulsed
in
the
manner
of
though
more
lurid
and
in
a
few
seconds
was
gone
she
paused
here
for
a
moment
rather
to
rest
after
her
climb
than
to
look
at
what
she
had
seen
so
often
then
directed
her
steps
to
one
of
the
houses
within
sight
she
pushed
the
door
and
entered
a
little
parlour
where
a
fire
and
a
lamp
made
cheery
welcome
by
the
hearth
in
a
wooden
chair
sat
a
man
whose
hard
features
proclaimed
his
relation
to
eve
otherwise
seeming
so
improbable
he
looked
up
from
the
volume
open
on
his
knee
a
bible
and
said
in
a
rough
kind
voice
i
was
thinkin
it
be
about
toime
for
you
you
look
starved
my
lass
yes
it
has
turned
very
cold
i
got
a
bit
o
supper
ready
for
you
i
do
want
none
myself
there
food
enough
for
me
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
book
call
to
mind
the
eighteenth
of
ezekiel
lass
if
the
wicked
will
turn
from
all
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed
eve
stood
motionless
till
he
had
read
the
verse
then
nodded
and
began
to
take
off
her
garments
she
was
unable
to
talk
and
her
eyes
wandered
absently
chapter
xix
after
a
week
inquiry
hilliard
discovered
the
lodging
that
would
suit
his
purpose
it
was
camp
hill
two
small
rooms
at
the
top
of
a
house
the
of
which
was
occupied
as
a
shop
and
the
story
above
that
tenanted
by
a
working
optician
with
a
blind
wife
on
condition
of
papering
the
rooms
and
doing
a
few
repairs
necessary
to
make
them
habitable
he
secured
them
at
the
low
rent
of
four
shillings
a
week
eve
paid
her
first
visit
to
this
delectable
abode
on
a
sunday
afternoon
she
saw
only
the
which
would
bear
inspection
the
appearance
of
the
was
happily
left
to
her
surmise
less
than
a
note
had
paid
for
the
whole
furnishing
notwithstanding
the
reckless
invitation
to
eve
to
share
his
fortunes
straightway
hilliard
after
paving
his
premium
of
fifty
guineas
to
the
birching
brothers
found
but
a
very
small
remnant
in
hand
of
the
money
with
which
he
had
set
forth
from
dudley
some
nine
months
ago
yet
not
for
a
moment
did
he
repine
he
had
the
value
of
his
outlay
his
mind
was
stored
with
memories
and
his
heart
strengthened
with
hope
at
her
second
coming
she
herself
now
occupied
a
poor
little
lodging
not
very
far
away
eve
beheld
sundry
improvements
by
the
fireside
stood
a
great
leather
chair
deep
wondrously
over
against
the
creaky
cane
seat
which
before
had
dominated
the
room
against
the
wall
was
a
high
bookcase
where
hilliard
volumes
previously
piled
on
the
floor
stood
in
loose
array
and
above
the
mantelpiece
hung
a
framed
engraving
of
the
parthenon
this
is
dreadful
extravagance
she
exclaimed
pausing
at
the
threshold
and
eying
her
welcomer
with
mock
reproof
it
is
but
not
on
my
part
the
things
came
a
day
or
two
ago
simply
addressed
to
me
from
shops
who
was
the
giver
then
must
be
narramore
of
course
he
was
here
not
long
ago
and
growled
a
good
deal
because
i
had
a
decent
chair
for
his
lazy
bones
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
said
eve
as
she
sank
back
in
the
seat
of
luxurious
repose
you
ought
to
hang
his
portrait
in
the
room
you
a
photograph
she
added
carelessly
such
a
thing
does
exist
like
myself
he
has
had
a
portrait
taken
since
he
was
a
child
a
curious
thing
that
you
should
have
had
yours
taken
just
when
you
did
of
course
it
was
because
you
were
going
far
away
for
the
first
time
but
it
marked
a
point
in
your
life
and
put
on
record
the
eve
madeley
whom
no
one
would
see
again
if
i
ca
get
that
photograph
in
any
other
way
i
shall
go
and
buy
beg
or
steal
it
from
mrs
brewer
oh
you
shall
have
one
if
you
insist
upon
it
why
did
you
refuse
it
before
i
hardly
know
a
fancy
i
thought
you
would
keep
looking
at
it
and
regretting
that
i
had
changed
so
as
on
her
previous
visit
she
soon
ceased
to
talk
and
in
listening
to
hilliard
showed
unconsciously
a
tired
despondent
face
nothing
yet
fell
from
her
lips
when
he
had
watched
her
silently
never
mind
i
hate
the
mention
of
it
he
resumed
narramore
astounded
me
by
hinting
at
marriage
it
miss
birching
the
sister
of
my
man
it
has
come
to
an
engagement
yet
and
if
it
ever
does
i
shall
give
miss
birching
the
credit
for
it
it
would
have
amused
you
to
hear
him
talking
about
her
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
half
asleep
i
understand
now
why
he
took
young
birching
with
him
to
switzerland
he
never
carry
it
through
unless
as
i
said
miss
birching
takes
the
decisive
step
is
she
the
kind
of
girl
to
do
that
asked
eve
waking
to
curiosity
i
know
nothing
about
her
except
from
narramore
sleepy
talk
rather
an
arrogant
beauty
according
to
him
he
told
me
a
story
of
how
when
he
was
calling
upon
her
she
begged
him
to
ring
the
bell
for
something
or
other
and
he
was
so
slow
in
getting
up
that
she
went
and
rang
it
herself
own
fault
he
said
asked
me
to
sit
on
a
chair
with
a
seat
some
six
inches
above
the
ground
and
how
can
a
man
hurry
up
from
a
thing
of
that
sort
he
must
be
a
strange
man
of
course
he
does
care
anything
about
miss
birching
but
i
think
he
does
in
his
way
how
did
he
ever
get
on
at
all
in
business
oh
he
one
of
the
lucky
men
hilliard
replied
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
he
never
exerted
himself
good
things
fell
into
his
mouth
people
got
to
like
him
that
one
explanation
no
doubt
do
you
think
he
may
have
more
energy
than
you
imagine
it
possible
i
have
sometimes
wondered
what
sort
of
life
does
he
lead
has
he
many
friends
i
mean
very
few
i
should
doubt
whether
there
anyone
he
talks
with
as
he
does
with
me
he
never
get
much
good
out
of
his
money
but
if
he
fell
into
real
poverty
poverty
like
mine
it
would
kill
him
i
know
he
looks
at
me
as
an
astonishing
creature
and
marvels
that
i
do
buy
a
good
dose
of
chloral
and
have
done
with
it
eve
did
not
join
in
his
laugh
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
speak
of
your
poverty
she
said
in
an
undertone
you
remind
me
that
i
am
the
cause
of
it
good
heavens
as
if
i
should
mention
it
if
i
were
capable
of
such
a
thought
but
it
the
fact
she
persisted
with
something
like
irritation
but
for
me
you
would
have
gone
into
the
architect
office
with
enough
to
live
upon
comfortably
for
a
time
that
altogether
unlikely
hilliard
declared
but
for
you
improbable
that
i
should
have
gone
to
birching
at
all
at
this
moment
i
should
be
spending
my
money
in
idleness
and
in
the
end
should
have
gone
back
to
what
i
did
before
you
have
given
me
a
start
in
a
new
life
this
and
much
more
of
the
same
tenor
failed
to
bring
a
light
upon
eve
countenance
at
length
she
asked
suddenly
with
a
defiant
bluntness
have
you
ever
thought
what
sort
of
a
wife
i
am
likely
to
make
hilliard
tried
to
laugh
but
was
disagreeably
impressed
by
her
words
and
the
look
that
accompanied
them
i
have
thought
about
it
to
be
sure
he
answered
carelessly
and
do
you
feel
a
need
of
courage
of
course
and
not
only
the
need
but
the
courage
itself
tell
me
the
real
honest
truth
she
bent
forward
and
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
one
might
have
thought
hostile
i
demand
the
truth
of
you
i
have
a
right
to
know
it
do
you
often
wish
you
had
never
seen
me
you
in
a
strange
mood
do
put
me
off
answer
to
ask
such
a
question
he
replied
quietly
is
to
charge
me
with
a
great
deal
of
hypocrisy
i
did
all
but
wish
i
had
never
seen
you
if
i
lost
you
now
i
should
lose
what
seems
to
me
the
strongest
desire
of
my
life
do
you
suppose
i
sit
down
and
meditate
on
your
capacity
as
cook
or
housemaid
it
would
be
very
prudent
and
laudable
but
i
have
other
thoughts
that
give
me
trouble
enough
what
thoughts
such
as
one
does
talk
about
if
you
insist
on
frankness
her
eyes
wandered
it
only
right
to
tell
you
she
said
after
silence
that
i
dread
poverty
as
much
as
ever
i
did
and
i
think
poverty
in
marriage
a
thousand
times
worse
than
when
one
is
alone
well
we
agree
in
that
but
why
do
you
insist
upon
it
just
now
are
beginning
to
be
sorry
that
we
ever
met
not
a
day
passes
but
i
feel
sorry
for
it
i
suppose
you
are
harping
on
the
old
scruple
why
will
you
plague
me
about
it
i
mean
said
eve
with
eyes
down
that
you
are
the
worse
off
for
having
met
me
but
i
mean
something
else
as
well
do
you
think
it
possible
that
anyone
can
owe
too
much
gratitude
even
to
a
person
one
likes
he
regarded
her
attentively
you
feel
the
burden
she
delayed
her
answer
glancing
at
him
with
a
new
expression
a
deprecating
tenderness
it
better
to
tell
you
i
feel
it
and
have
always
felt
it
confound
this
infernal
atmosphere
hilliard
broke
out
wrathfully
it
making
you
morbid
again
come
here
to
me
eve
come
as
she
sat
motionless
he
caught
her
hands
and
drew
her
forward
and
sat
down
again
with
her
passive
body
resting
upon
his
knees
she
was
pale
and
looked
frightened
your
gratitude
be
hanged
pay
me
back
with
your
lips
so
and
so
ca
you
understand
that
when
my
lips
touch
yours
i
have
a
delight
that
would
be
well
purchased
with
years
of
what
is
it
to
me
how
i
won
you
you
are
mine
for
good
and
all
that
enough
she
drew
herself
half
away
and
stood
brightly
flushed
touching
her
hair
to
set
it
in
order
again
hilliard
with
difficulty
controlling
himself
said
in
a
husky
voice
is
the
mood
gone
eve
nodded
and
sighed
chapter
xx
at
the
time
appointed
for
their
next
meeting
hilliard
waited
in
vain
an
hour
passed
and
eve
who
had
the
uncommon
virtue
of
punctuality
still
did
not
come
the
weather
was
miserable
rain
fog
and
slush
but
this
had
heretofore
proved
no
obstacle
for
her
lodgings
were
situated
less
than
half
a
mile
away
afraid
of
missing
her
if
he
went
out
he
fretted
through
another
hour
and
was
at
length
relieved
by
the
arrival
of
a
letter
of
explanation
eve
wrote
that
she
had
been
summoned
to
dudley
her
father
was
stricken
with
alarming
illness
and
her
brother
had
telegraphed
for
two
days
he
heard
nothing
then
came
a
few
lines
which
told
him
that
madeley
could
not
live
many
more
hours
on
the
morrow
eve
wrote
that
her
father
was
dead
to
the
letter
which
he
thereupon
despatched
hilliard
had
no
reply
for
nearly
a
week
when
eve
wrote
it
was
from
a
new
address
at
dudley
after
thanking
him
for
the
kind
words
with
which
he
had
sought
to
comfort
her
she
continued
i
have
at
last
found
something
to
do
and
it
was
quite
time
for
i
have
been
very
miserable
and
work
is
the
best
thing
for
me
welland
my
first
employer
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
has
asked
me
to
come
and
keep
his
books
for
him
and
i
am
to
live
in
his
house
my
brother
has
gone
into
lodgings
and
we
see
no
more
of
the
cottage
on
kate
hill
it
a
pity
i
have
to
be
so
far
from
you
again
but
there
seems
to
be
no
hope
of
getting
anything
to
do
in
birmingham
and
here
i
shall
be
comfortable
enough
as
far
as
mere
living
goes
on
sunday
i
shall
be
quite
free
and
will
come
over
as
often
as
possible
but
i
have
caught
a
bad
cold
and
must
be
content
to
keep
in
the
house
until
this
dreadful
weather
changes
be
more
careful
of
yourself
than
you
generally
are
and
let
me
hear
often
in
a
few
months
time
we
shall
be
able
to
spend
pleasant
hours
on
the
castle
hill
i
have
heard
from
patty
and
want
to
tell
you
about
her
letter
but
this
cold
makes
me
feel
too
stupid
will
write
again
soon
it
happened
that
hilliard
himself
was
just
now
blind
and
voiceless
with
a
catarrh
the
news
from
dudley
by
no
means
solaced
him
he
crouched
over
his
fire
through
the
long
black
day
tormented
with
many
miseries
and
at
eventide
drank
half
a
bottle
of
whisky
piping
hot
which
at
least
assured
him
of
a
night
sleep
just
to
see
what
would
be
the
result
of
his
silence
he
wrote
no
reply
to
this
letter
a
fortnight
elapsed
he
strengthened
himself
in
stubbornness
aided
by
the
catarrh
which
many
bottles
of
whisky
would
not
overcome
when
his
solitary
confinement
grew
at
length
insufferable
he
sent
for
narramore
and
had
not
long
to
wait
before
his
friend
appeared
narramore
was
rosy
as
ever
satisfaction
with
life
beamed
from
his
countenance
i
ordered
you
in
some
wine
he
exclaimed
genially
sinking
into
the
which
hilliard
had
vacated
for
him
an
instance
of
selfishness
in
small
things
which
did
not
affect
his
generosity
in
greater
it
is
easy
to
get
good
port
nowadays
but
they
tell
me
that
this
is
not
injurious
has
young
birching
been
to
see
you
no
i
suppose
he
would
think
it
to
come
to
this
neighbourhood
there
a
damnable
in
that
family
you
must
have
noticed
it
eh
it
comes
out
very
strongly
in
the
girl
i
done
with
her
have
been
there
for
three
weeks
and
do
think
i
shall
go
again
unless
it
for
the
pleasure
of
saying
or
doing
something
that
irritate
her
royal
highness
did
you
quarrel
quarrel
i
never
quarrel
with
anyone
it
bad
for
one
nerves
did
you
get
as
far
as
proposing
oh
i
left
to
do
that
women
are
making
such
a
row
about
their
rights
nowadays
that
it
as
well
to
show
you
grant
them
perfect
equality
i
gave
her
every
chance
of
saying
something
definite
i
maintain
that
she
trifled
with
my
affections
she
asked
me
what
my
views
in
life
were
ah
thought
i
now
it
coming
and
i
answered
modestly
that
everything
depended
on
circumstances
i
might
have
said
it
depended
on
the
demand
for
brass
bedsteads
but
perhaps
that
would
have
verged
on
indelicacy
you
know
that
i
am
delicacy
personified
thought
said
miss
birching
a
man
of
any
energy
made
his
own
circumstances
i
shouted
you
look
for
energy
in
it
the
greatest
compliment
anyone
ever
paid
me
at
that
she
seemed
desperately
annoyed
and
would
pursue
the
subject
that
how
it
always
was
just
when
the
conversation
grew
interesting
i
sorry
to
see
you
so
cut
up
about
it
remarked
hilliard
none
of
your
irony
old
fellow
well
the
truth
is
i
seen
someone
i
like
better
not
surprised
it
a
queer
story
i
tell
it
you
some
day
if
it
comes
to
anything
i
not
at
all
sure
that
it
will
as
there
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
lurking
danger
that
i
may
make
a
damned
fool
of
myself
improbable
commented
the
listener
your
blood
is
too
temperate
so
i
thought
but
one
never
knows
unexpected
feelings
crop
up
in
a
fellow
we
wo
talk
about
it
just
now
how
have
things
been
going
in
the
architectural
line
not
amiss
steadily
i
think
narramore
lay
back
at
full
length
his
face
turned
to
the
ceiling
since
i
been
living
out
yonder
i
got
a
taste
for
the
country
i
have
a
notion
that
if
brass
bedsteads
keep
firm
i
shall
some
day
build
a
little
house
of
my
own
an
inexpensive
little
house
with
a
tree
or
two
about
it
just
make
me
a
few
sketches
will
you
when
you
nothing
better
to
do
you
know
he
played
with
the
idea
till
it
took
strong
hold
of
him
and
he
began
to
talk
with
most
unwonted
animation
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
i
ought
to
be
able
to
sink
that
in
a
few
years
not
enough
eh
but
i
do
want
a
mansion
i
quite
serious
about
this
hilliard
when
you
re
feeling
ready
to
start
on
your
own
account
you
shall
have
the
job
hilliard
laughed
grimly
at
the
supposition
that
he
would
ever
attain
professional
independence
but
his
friend
talked
on
and
overleaped
difficulties
with
a
buoyancy
of
spirit
which
ultimately
had
its
effect
upon
the
listener
when
he
was
alone
again
hilliard
felt
better
both
in
body
and
mind
and
that
evening
over
the
first
bottle
of
narramore
port
he
amused
himself
with
sketching
ideal
cottages
the
fellow
in
love
at
last
when
a
man
thinks
of
pleasant
little
country
houses
a
tree
or
two
about
them
he
sighed
and
ground
his
teeth
and
sketched
on
before
bedtime
a
sudden
and
profound
shame
possessed
him
was
he
not
behaving
outrageously
in
neglecting
to
answer
eve
letter
for
all
he
knew
the
cold
of
which
she
complained
might
have
caused
her
more
suffering
than
he
himself
had
gone
through
from
the
like
cause
and
that
was
bad
enough
he
seized
paper
and
wrote
to
her
as
he
had
never
written
before
borne
on
the
very
high
flood
of
passionate
longing
without
regard
to
prudence
he
left
the
house
at
midnight
and
posted
his
letter
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
blame
you
for
not
writing
eve
quickly
replied
i
afraid
you
are
more
sensitive
than
i
am
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
believe
men
generally
more
sensitive
than
women
in
things
of
this
kind
it
pleased
me
very
much
to
hear
of
the
visit
you
had
had
from
narramore
and
that
he
had
cheered
you
i
do
so
wish
i
could
have
come
but
i
have
really
been
quite
ill
and
i
must
not
think
of
risking
a
journey
till
the
weather
improves
do
trouble
about
it
i
will
write
often
i
told
you
about
a
letter
i
had
had
from
poor
patty
and
i
want
to
ask
you
to
do
something
will
you
write
to
her
just
a
nice
friendly
little
letter
she
would
be
so
delighted
she
would
indeed
there
no
harm
in
copying
a
line
or
two
from
what
she
sent
me
hilliard
forgotten
all
about
me
she
says
would
write
to
him
but
i
feel
afraid
not
afraid
of
dear
eve
but
he
might
feel
i
was
impertinent
what
do
you
think
we
had
such
delicious
times
together
he
and
you
and
i
and
i
really
do
want
him
to
forget
me
altogether
now
i
have
told
her
that
there
is
no
fear
whatever
of
your
forgetting
her
and
that
we
often
speak
of
her
i
begin
to
think
that
i
have
been
unjust
to
patty
in
calling
her
silly
and
making
fun
of
her
she
was
anything
but
foolish
in
breaking
off
with
that
absurd
dally
and
i
can
see
now
that
she
will
never
give
a
thought
to
him
again
what
i
fear
is
that
the
poor
girl
will
never
find
any
one
good
enough
for
her
the
men
she
meets
are
very
vulgar
and
vulgar
patty
is
as
you
once
said
to
me
you
remember
so
if
you
can
spare
a
minute
write
her
a
few
lines
to
show
that
you
still
think
of
her
her
address
is
etc
to
hilliard
all
this
seemed
merely
a
pleasant
proof
of
amiability
of
her
freedom
from
that
acrid
monopolism
which
characterises
the
ignoble
female
in
her
love
relations
straightway
he
did
as
he
was
requested
and
penned
to
miss
ringrose
a
chatty
epistle
with
which
she
could
not
but
be
satisfied
a
day
or
two
brought
him
an
answer
patty
handwriting
lacked
distinction
and
in
the
matter
of
orthography
she
was
not
beyond
reproach
but
her
letter
chirped
with
a
prettily
expressed
gratitude
i
am
living
with
my
aunt
and
am
likely
to
for
a
long
time
and
i
get
on
very
well
at
my
new
shop
which
i
have
no
wish
to
leave
this
was
her
only
allusion
to
the
shattered
matrimonial
project
i
wish
there
was
any
chance
of
you
and
eve
coming
to
live
in
london
but
i
suppose
that
too
good
to
hope
for
we
get
many
things
as
we
wish
them
in
this
world
and
yet
i
ought
to
say
that
either
for
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
never
have
seen
paris
which
was
so
awfully
jolly
but
you
be
coming
for
a
holiday
wo
you
i
should
so
like
just
to
see
you
if
ever
you
do
it
like
it
was
at
the
old
shop
there
a
great
deal
of
business
done
here
and
very
little
time
to
talk
to
anyone
in
the
shop
but
many
girls
have
worse
things
to
put
up
with
than
i
have
and
i
wo
make
you
think
i
a
grumbler
the
whole
of
january
went
by
before
hilliard
and
eve
again
saw
each
other
the
lover
wrote
at
length
that
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
that
he
was
coming
to
dudley
if
only
for
the
mere
sight
of
eve
face
she
must
meet
him
in
the
at
the
railway
station
she
answered
by
return
of
post
i
will
come
over
next
sunday
and
be
with
you
at
twelve
but
i
must
leave
very
early
as
i
am
afraid
to
be
out
after
nightfall
and
this
engagement
was
kept
the
dress
of
mourning
became
her
well
it
heightened
her
always
noticeable
air
of
refinement
and
would
have
constrained
to
a
reverential
tenderness
even
had
not
hilliard
naturally
checked
himself
from
any
bolder
demonstration
of
joy
she
spoke
in
a
low
soft
voice
seldom
raised
her
eyes
and
manifested
a
new
gentleness
very
touching
to
hilliard
though
at
the
same
time
and
he
knew
not
how
or
why
it
did
not
answer
to
his
desire
a
midday
meal
was
in
readiness
for
her
she
pretended
to
eat
but
in
reality
scarce
touched
the
food
you
must
taste
old
narramore
port
wine
said
her
entertainer
the
fellow
actually
sent
a
couple
of
dozen
she
was
not
to
be
persuaded
her
refusal
puzzled
and
annoyed
hilliard
and
there
followed
a
long
silence
indeed
it
surprised
him
to
find
how
little
they
could
say
to
each
other
an
unknown
restraint
had
come
between
them
well
he
exclaimed
at
length
i
wrote
to
patty
and
she
answered
may
i
see
the
letter
of
course
here
it
is
eve
read
it
and
smiled
with
pleasure
does
she
write
nicely
poor
girl
why
have
you
taken
so
to
commiserating
her
all
at
once
hilliard
asked
she
no
worse
off
than
she
ever
was
rather
better
i
think
life
is
the
same
for
her
since
she
was
in
paris
said
eve
with
peculiar
softness
well
perhaps
it
improved
her
oh
it
certainly
did
but
it
gave
her
a
feeling
of
discontent
for
the
old
life
and
the
people
about
her
a
good
many
of
us
have
to
suffer
that
she
nothing
like
as
badly
off
as
you
are
my
dear
girl
eve
coloured
and
kept
silence
we
shall
hear
of
her
getting
married
before
long
resumed
the
other
she
told
me
herself
that
marriage
was
the
scourge
of
it
carries
off
their
young
women
at
such
a
rate
she
told
you
that
it
was
in
one
of
your
long
talks
together
in
london
patty
and
you
got
on
capitally
together
it
was
very
natural
she
should
care
much
for
men
like
dally
afterwards
hilliard
puzzled
over
this
remark
and
was
on
the
point
of
making
some
impatient
reply
but
discretion
restrained
him
he
turned
to
eve
own
affairs
questioned
her
closely
about
her
life
in
the
house
and
so
their
conversation
followed
a
smoother
course
presently
half
in
jest
hilliard
mentioned
narramore
building
projects
but
who
knows
it
come
to
something
of
importance
for
me
in
two
or
three
years
if
all
goes
well
such
a
thing
might
possibly
give
me
a
start
a
singular
solemnity
had
settled
upon
eve
countenance
she
spoke
not
a
word
and
seemed
unaccountably
ill
at
ease
do
you
think
i
am
in
the
clouds
said
hilliard
oh
no
why
should
you
get
on
as
other
men
do
but
she
would
not
dwell
upon
the
hope
and
hilliard
not
a
little
vexed
again
became
silent
her
next
visit
was
after
a
lapse
of
three
weeks
she
had
again
been
suffering
from
a
slight
illness
and
her
pallor
alarmed
hilliard
again
she
began
with
talk
of
patty
ringrose
do
you
know
there
really
a
chance
that
we
may
see
her
before
long
she
have
a
holiday
at
easter
from
the
thursday
night
to
monday
night
and
i
have
all
but
got
her
to
promise
that
she
come
over
here
would
it
be
fun
to
let
her
see
the
black
country
you
remember
her
talk
about
it
i
could
get
her
a
room
and
if
it
at
all
bearable
weather
we
would
all
have
a
day
somewhere
would
you
like
that
yes
but
i
should
greatly
prefer
a
day
with
you
alone
oh
of
course
the
time
is
coming
for
that
would
you
let
us
come
here
one
day
with
a
persistence
not
to
be
mistaken
eve
avoided
all
intimate
topics
at
the
same
time
her
manner
grew
more
cordial
through
february
and
march
she
decidedly
improved
in
health
hilliard
saw
her
seldom
but
she
wrote
frequent
letters
and
their
note
was
as
that
of
her
conversation
lively
all
but
sportive
once
again
she
had
become
a
mystery
to
her
lover
he
pondered
over
her
very
much
as
in
the
days
when
they
were
newly
acquainted
of
one
thing
he
felt
but
too
well
assured
she
did
not
love
him
as
he
desired
to
be
loved
constant
she
might
be
but
it
was
the
constancy
of
a
woman
unaffected
with
ardent
emotion
if
she
granted
him
her
lips
they
had
no
fervour
respondent
to
his
own
she
made
a
sport
of
it
forgot
it
as
soon
as
possible
upon
hilliard
vehement
nature
this
acted
provocatively
at
times
he
was
all
but
frenzied
with
the
violence
of
his
sensual
impulses
yet
control
of
him
grew
more
assured
the
less
she
granted
of
herself
a
look
a
motion
of
her
lips
and
he
drew
apart
quivering
but
subdued
at
one
such
moment
he
exclaimed
you
had
better
not
come
here
at
all
i
love
you
too
insanely
eve
looked
at
him
and
silently
began
to
shed
tears
he
implored
her
pardon
prostrated
himself
behaved
in
a
manner
that
justified
his
warning
but
eve
stifled
the
serious
drama
of
the
situation
and
forced
him
to
laugh
with
her
in
these
days
architectural
study
made
little
way
patty
ringrose
was
coming
for
the
easter
holidays
she
would
arrive
on
good
friday
as
the
weather
is
so
very
bad
still
wrote
eve
to
hilliard
will
you
let
us
come
to
see
you
on
saturday
sunday
may
be
better
for
an
excursion
of
some
sort
and
thus
it
was
arranged
hilliard
made
ready
his
room
to
receive
the
fair
visitors
who
would
come
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
as
usual
nowadays
he
felt
discontented
but
after
all
patty
influence
might
be
a
help
to
him
as
it
had
been
in
worse
straits
chapter
xxi
he
had
the
house
to
himself
the
shop
was
closed
as
on
a
sunday
the
optician
and
his
blind
wife
had
locked
up
their
rooms
and
were
spending
it
might
be
hoped
amid
more
cheerful
surroundings
hilliard
sat
with
his
door
open
that
he
might
easily
hear
the
knock
which
announced
his
guests
at
the
entrance
below
it
sounded
at
length
but
timidly
had
he
not
been
listening
he
would
not
have
perceived
it
eve
handling
of
the
knocker
was
firmer
than
that
and
in
a
different
rhythm
apprehensive
of
disappointment
he
hurried
downstairs
and
opened
the
door
to
patty
ringrose
patty
alone
with
a
shy
but
pleased
laugh
her
cheeks
warm
and
her
eyes
bright
she
jerked
out
her
hand
to
him
as
in
the
old
days
i
know
you
wo
be
glad
to
see
me
i
so
sorry
i
said
i
had
better
not
come
of
course
i
am
glad
to
see
you
but
where
eve
it
so
unfortunate
she
has
such
a
bad
headache
panted
the
girl
she
could
possibly
come
and
i
wanted
to
stay
with
her
i
said
i
should
only
disappoint
you
it
a
pity
of
course
but
i
glad
you
came
for
all
that
hilliard
stifled
his
dissatisfaction
and
misgivings
you
think
this
a
queer
sort
of
place
i
quite
alone
here
but
after
you
have
rested
a
little
we
can
go
somewhere
else
yes
eve
told
me
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
take
me
to
see
things
not
tired
i
wo
come
in
if
you
rather
oh
you
may
as
well
see
what
sort
of
a
den
i
made
for
myself
he
led
the
way
upstairs
when
she
reached
the
top
patty
was
again
breathless
the
result
of
excitement
more
than
exertion
she
exclaimed
at
sight
of
the
how
cosy
it
was
what
a
scent
from
the
flowers
did
he
always
buy
flowers
for
his
room
no
doubt
it
was
to
please
eve
what
a
comfortable
chair
of
course
eve
always
sat
in
this
chair
then
her
babbling
ceased
and
she
looked
up
at
hilliard
who
stood
over
against
her
with
nervous
delight
he
could
perceive
no
change
whatever
in
her
except
that
she
was
better
dressed
than
formerly
not
a
day
seemed
to
have
been
added
to
her
age
her
voice
had
precisely
the
intonations
that
he
remembered
after
all
it
was
little
more
than
half
a
year
since
they
were
together
in
paris
but
to
hilliard
the
winter
had
seemed
of
interminable
length
and
he
expected
to
find
miss
ringrose
a
much
altered
person
when
did
this
headache
begin
he
inquired
trying
to
speak
without
concern
she
had
a
little
yesterday
when
she
met
me
at
the
station
i
think
she
was
looking
at
all
well
i
surprised
to
hear
that
she
looked
particularly
well
when
i
saw
her
last
had
you
any
trouble
in
making
your
way
here
oh
not
a
bit
i
found
the
tram
just
as
eve
told
me
but
i
so
sorry
and
a
fine
day
too
you
do
often
have
fine
days
here
do
you
mr
hilliard
now
and
then
so
you
seen
dudley
at
last
what
do
you
think
of
it
oh
i
like
it
i
should
mind
living
there
a
bit
but
of
course
i
like
birmingham
better
almost
as
fine
as
paris
is
it
you
do
mean
that
of
course
but
i
only
seen
a
few
of
the
streets
and
most
of
the
shops
are
shut
up
is
it
a
pity
eve
has
to
live
so
far
off
though
of
course
it
is
really
very
far
and
i
suppose
you
see
each
other
often
hilliard
took
a
seat
crossed
his
legs
and
grasped
his
knee
the
girl
appeared
to
wait
for
an
answer
to
her
last
words
but
he
said
nothing
and
stared
at
the
floor
if
it
fine
patty
continued
after
observing
him
furtively
are
you
coming
to
dudley
yes
i
shall
come
over
did
she
send
any
message
no
nothing
particular
patty
looked
confused
stroked
her
dress
and
gave
a
little
cough
but
if
it
rains
as
it
very
likely
will
there
no
use
in
my
coming
no
she
said
not
or
if
her
headache
is
still
troubling
her
let
hope
it
will
be
better
but
in
any
case
she
be
able
to
come
with
me
to
birmingham
on
monday
when
i
go
back
i
must
be
home
again
on
monday
night
do
you
think
said
hilliard
carelessly
that
eve
would
rather
have
you
to
herself
just
for
the
short
time
you
are
here
patty
made
vigorous
objection
i
do
think
that
at
all
it
quite
settled
that
you
are
to
come
over
if
it
fine
oh
and
i
hope
it
will
be
it
would
be
so
dreadful
to
be
shut
up
in
the
house
all
day
at
dudley
how
very
awkward
that
there
no
place
where
she
can
have
you
there
if
it
rains
had
we
better
come
here
i
sure
it
would
be
better
for
eve
she
seems
to
get
into
such
low
spirits
just
like
she
was
sometimes
in
london
that
quite
news
to
me
said
the
listener
gravely
does
she
let
you
know
then
i
so
sorry
i
mentioned
it
you
tell
her
i
said
anything
wait
a
moment
does
she
say
that
she
is
often
in
low
spirits
patty
faltered
stroking
her
dress
with
the
movement
of
increasing
nervousness
it
better
i
should
know
hilliard
added
i
afraid
she
keeps
all
this
from
me
for
several
weeks
i
have
thought
her
in
particularly
good
health
but
she
tells
me
just
the
opposite
she
says
says
what
perhaps
it
only
the
place
that
does
agree
with
her
i
do
think
dudley
is
healthy
do
you
i
never
heard
of
doctors
sending
convalescents
there
but
eve
must
be
suffering
from
some
other
cause
i
think
does
it
strike
you
that
she
is
at
all
like
what
she
used
to
be
when
when
you
felt
so
anxious
about
her
he
met
the
girl
eyes
and
saw
them
expand
in
alarm
i
did
think
i
did
mean
she
stammered
no
but
i
have
a
reason
for
asking
is
it
so
or
not
do
frighten
me
hilliard
i
do
so
wish
i
had
said
anything
she
is
in
good
health
that
all
how
can
you
think
that
was
all
over
long
ago
and
she
would
never
i
she
would
after
all
you
done
for
her
hilliard
ground
the
carpet
with
his
foot
and
all
but
uttered
a
violent
ejaculation
i
know
she
is
all
gratitude
were
the
words
that
became
audible
she
is
indeed
urged
patty
she
says
that
even
if
she
wished
she
could
never
break
off
with
you
as
i
am
she
would
never
wish
ah
that
what
she
says
murmured
the
other
and
abruptly
he
rose
there
no
use
in
talking
about
this
you
are
here
for
a
holiday
and
not
to
be
bored
with
other
people
troubles
the
sun
is
trying
to
shine
let
us
go
and
see
the
town
and
then
yes
i
go
back
with
you
to
dudley
just
to
hear
whether
eve
is
feeling
any
better
you
could
see
her
and
then
come
out
and
tell
me
hilliard
i
quite
sure
you
are
worrying
without
any
cause
you
are
indeed
i
know
i
am
it
all
nonsense
come
along
and
let
us
enjoy
the
sunshine
they
spent
three
or
four
hours
together
hilliard
resolute
in
his
discharge
of
hospitable
duties
and
miss
ringrose
after
a
brief
spell
of
unnatural
gravity
allowing
no
reflection
to
interfere
with
her
holiday
mood
hilliard
had
never
felt
quite
sure
as
to
the
limits
of
patty
intelligence
he
could
not
take
her
seriously
and
yet
felt
unable
to
treat
her
altogether
as
a
child
or
an
imbecile
because
of
his
preoccupied
thoughts
and
the
effort
it
cost
him
to
be
jocose
he
talked
for
the
most
part
in
a
vein
of
irony
which
impressed
but
did
not
much
enlighten
his
hearer
this
said
he
when
they
had
reached
the
centre
of
things
is
the
acropolis
of
birmingham
here
are
our
great
buildings
of
which
we
boast
to
the
world
they
signify
the
triumph
of
democracy
and
of
money
in
front
of
you
stands
the
town
hall
here
to
the
left
is
the
midland
institute
where
a
great
deal
of
lecturing
goes
on
and
the
big
free
library
where
you
can
either
read
or
go
to
sleep
i
have
done
both
in
my
time
behind
yonder
you
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
fountain
that
plays
to
the
glory
of
joseph
chamberlain
did
you
ever
hear
of
him
and
further
back
still
is
mason
college
where
young
men
are
taught
a
variety
of
things
including
discontent
with
a
small
income
to
the
right
there
that
the
council
hall
splendid
is
it
we
bring
our
little
boys
to
look
at
it
and
tell
them
if
they
make
money
enough
they
may
some
day
go
in
and
out
as
if
it
were
their
own
house
behind
it
you
see
the
art
gallery
we
do
really
care
for
pictures
a
great
big
machine
is
our
genuine
delight
but
it
would
be
nice
to
tell
everybody
that
what
a
lot
i
have
learnt
from
you
exclaimed
the
girl
ingenuously
when
at
length
they
turned
their
steps
towards
the
railway
station
i
shall
always
remember
birmingham
you
like
it
much
better
than
london
do
you
i
glory
in
the
place
hilliard
was
tired
out
he
repented
of
his
proposal
to
make
the
journey
to
dudley
and
back
but
his
companion
did
not
suspect
this
i
sure
eve
will
come
out
and
have
a
little
walk
with
us
she
said
comfortingly
and
she
think
it
so
kind
of
you
at
dudley
station
there
were
crowds
of
people
patty
asked
leave
to
hold
by
her
companion
arm
as
they
made
their
way
to
the
exit
just
outside
hilliard
heard
himself
hailed
in
a
familiar
voice
he
turned
and
saw
narramore
i
beg
your
pardon
said
his
friend
coming
near
i
did
notice
i
thought
you
were
alone
or
of
course
i
should
have
shouted
shall
you
be
at
home
afternoon
if
it
rains
it
sure
to
rain
i
shall
look
in
about
four
chapter
xxii
with
a
glance
at
miss
ringrose
he
raised
his
hat
and
passed
on
hilliard
confused
by
the
rapid
rencontre
half
annoyed
at
having
been
seen
with
patty
and
half
wishing
he
had
not
granted
the
appointment
for
tomorrow
as
it
might
interfere
with
a
visit
from
the
girls
walked
forward
in
silence
so
we
really
see
you
if
it
wet
tomorrow
said
patty
better
not
eve
would
be
afraid
to
come
she
catches
cold
so
easily
it
may
be
fine
like
i
do
hope
she
broke
off
and
added
why
is
that
eve
in
front
eve
it
certainly
was
walking
slowly
away
from
the
station
a
few
yards
in
advance
of
them
they
quickened
their
pace
and
patty
caught
her
friend
by
the
arm
eve
startled
out
of
abstraction
stared
at
her
with
eyes
of
dismay
and
bloodless
cheeks
did
i
frighten
you
hilliard
has
come
back
with
me
to
ask
how
you
are
is
your
head
better
i
just
been
down
to
the
station
for
something
to
do
said
eve
her
look
fixed
on
hilliard
with
what
seemed
to
him
a
very
strange
intensity
the
afternoon
was
so
fine
we
had
a
splendid
time
cried
patty
hilliard
has
shown
me
everything
i
so
glad
i
should
only
have
spoilt
it
if
i
had
been
with
you
wretched
going
about
with
a
headache
and
i
ca
make
believe
to
enjoy
birmingham
eve
spoke
hurriedly
still
regarding
hilliard
who
looked
upon
the
ground
have
you
been
alone
all
day
he
asked
taking
the
outer
place
at
her
side
as
they
walked
on
of
course
except
for
the
people
in
the
house
was
her
offhand
reply
i
met
narramore
down
at
the
station
he
must
have
passed
you
what
has
brought
him
here
i
wonder
appearing
not
to
heed
the
remark
eve
glanced
across
at
patty
and
said
with
a
laugh
it
like
paris
again
is
it
we
three
you
ought
to
come
and
live
here
patty
do
you
think
you
could
get
a
place
in
birmingham
hilliard
would
get
a
piano
for
his
room
and
you
could
let
him
have
some
music
i
too
old
to
learn
i
sure
he
would
want
jingling
there
would
he
he
very
fond
of
music
indeed
hilliard
stopped
well
i
do
think
i
go
any
further
he
said
mechanically
you
quite
well
again
eve
and
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
what
about
eve
asked
the
sun
had
set
and
in
the
westward
sky
rose
a
mountain
of
menacing
cloud
hilliard
gave
a
glance
in
that
direction
before
replying
do
count
upon
me
patty
and
you
will
enjoy
the
day
together
in
any
case
yes
i
had
rather
have
it
so
narramore
said
just
now
he
might
look
in
to
see
me
in
the
after
noon
but
come
over
on
monday
when
does
patty
train
go
from
new
street
eve
was
mute
gazing
at
the
speaker
as
if
she
did
not
catch
what
he
had
said
patty
answered
for
herself
then
you
can
either
come
to
my
place
he
continued
or
i
meet
you
at
the
station
patty
desire
was
evident
in
her
face
she
looked
at
eve
we
come
to
you
early
in
the
afternoon
said
the
latter
speaking
like
one
aroused
from
reverie
yes
we
come
whatever
the
weather
is
the
young
man
shook
hands
with
them
raised
his
hat
and
walked
away
without
further
speech
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
overtake
narramore
at
the
station
and
in
that
hope
he
hastened
but
narramore
must
have
left
by
a
london
and
train
which
had
just
started
he
was
nowhere
discoverable
hilliard
travelled
back
by
the
great
western
after
waiting
about
an
hour
he
had
for
companions
lads
who
roared
hymns
and
costers
catches
impartially
his
mind
was
haunted
with
deadly
suspicions
he
felt
sick
at
heart
eve
headache
undoubtedly
was
a
mere
pretence
for
not
accompanying
patty
she
had
desired
to
be
alone
and
this
he
discovered
no
less
clearly
she
wished
the
friendship
between
him
and
patty
to
be
fostered
with
what
foolish
hope
was
she
so
as
to
imagine
that
he
might
transfer
his
affections
to
patty
ringrose
it
proved
how
strong
her
desire
had
grown
to
be
free
from
him
the
innocent
patty
she
so
innocent
seemed
not
to
suspect
the
meaning
of
her
friend
talk
yet
eve
must
have
all
but
told
her
in
so
many
words
that
she
was
weary
of
her
lover
that
hateful
harping
on
gratitude
well
one
can
not
purchase
a
woman
love
he
had
missed
the
right
the
generous
line
of
conduct
that
would
have
been
to
rescue
eve
from
manifest
peril
and
then
to
ask
nothing
of
her
could
he
but
have
held
his
passions
in
leash
something
like
friendship
rarest
of
all
relations
between
man
and
woman
might
have
come
about
between
him
and
eve
she
too
certainly
had
never
got
beyond
the
stage
of
liking
him
as
a
companion
her
senses
had
never
answered
to
his
appeal
he
looked
back
upon
the
evening
when
they
had
dined
together
at
the
restaurant
in
holborn
could
he
but
have
stopped
at
point
there
would
have
been
no
harm
in
such
avowals
as
then
escaped
him
for
he
recognised
without
bitterness
that
the
warmth
of
feeling
was
all
on
one
side
and
eve
in
the
manner
of
her
sex
could
like
him
better
for
his
love
without
a
dream
of
returning
it
his
error
was
to
have
taken
advantage
perhaps
a
mean
advantage
of
the
strange
events
that
followed
if
he
restrained
himself
before
how
much
more
he
should
have
done
so
when
the
girl
had
put
herself
at
his
mercy
when
to
demand
her
love
was
the
obvious
commonplace
vulgar
outcome
of
the
situation
of
course
she
harped
on
gratitude
what
but
a
sense
of
obligation
had
constrained
her
something
had
taken
place
he
felt
it
as
a
miserable
certainty
the
man
from
london
had
been
with
her
she
expected
him
and
had
elaborately
planned
for
a
day
of
freedom
perhaps
her
invitation
of
patty
had
no
other
motive
that
patty
was
a
conspirator
against
him
he
could
not
believe
no
she
was
merely
an
instrument
of
eve
subtlety
and
his
suspicion
had
not
gone
beyond
the
truth
eve
entertained
the
hope
that
patty
might
take
her
place
perchance
the
silly
girl
would
feel
no
objection
though
it
was
not
very
likely
that
she
foresaw
or
schemed
for
such
an
issue
at
snow
hill
station
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
rise
and
leave
the
carriage
his
mood
was
sluggish
he
wished
to
sit
still
and
think
idly
over
the
course
of
events
he
went
byway
of
philip
church
which
stands
amid
a
wide
graveyard
enclosed
with
iron
railings
and
crossed
by
paved
walks
the
locality
was
all
but
forsaken
the
church
rose
black
against
the
grey
sky
and
the
lofty
places
of
business
round
about
were
darkly
silent
a
man
footstep
sounded
in
front
of
him
and
a
figure
approached
along
the
narrow
path
between
the
high
bars
hilliard
would
have
passed
without
attention
but
the
man
stopped
his
way
hollo
here
we
are
again
he
stared
at
the
speaker
and
recognised
dengate
so
you
come
back
where
from
said
hilliard
what
do
you
know
of
me
as
much
as
i
care
to
replied
the
other
with
a
laugh
so
you
quite
gone
to
the
devil
yet
i
gave
you
six
months
i
been
watching
the
police
news
in
the
london
papers
in
a
maddening
access
of
rage
hilliard
clenched
his
fist
and
struck
fiercely
at
the
man
but
he
did
no
harm
for
his
aim
was
wild
and
dengate
easily
warded
off
the
blows
hold
on
you
drunk
of
course
stop
it
my
lad
or
i
have
you
locked
up
till
monday
morning
very
obliging
of
you
to
offer
me
the
pleasure
i
was
expecting
but
you
have
it
eh
a
second
blow
was
repaid
in
kind
and
hilliard
staggered
back
against
the
railings
before
he
could
recover
himself
dengate
whose
high
hat
rolled
between
their
feet
pinned
his
arms
there
someone
coming
along
it
a
pity
i
should
enjoy
thrashing
you
and
then
running
you
in
but
a
man
of
my
position
does
care
to
get
mixed
up
in
a
street
row
it
would
sound
well
at
liverpool
stand
quiet
will
you
a
man
and
a
woman
drew
near
and
lingered
for
a
moment
in
curiosity
hilliard
already
amazed
at
what
he
had
done
became
passive
and
stood
with
bent
head
i
must
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
said
dengate
when
he
had
picked
up
his
hat
can
you
walk
straight
i
did
notice
you
were
drunk
before
i
spoke
to
you
come
along
this
way
to
escape
the
hilliard
moved
forward
i
always
regretted
resumed
his
companion
that
i
did
give
you
a
sound
thrashing
that
night
in
the
train
it
would
have
done
you
good
it
might
have
been
the
making
of
you
i
did
hurt
you
eh
you
bruised
my
lips
that
all
and
i
deserved
it
for
being
such
a
damned
fool
as
to
lose
my
temper
you
look
rather
more
decent
than
i
should
have
expected
what
have
you
been
doing
in
london
how
do
you
know
i
have
been
in
london
i
took
that
for
granted
when
i
knew
you
left
your
work
at
dudley
who
told
you
i
had
left
it
what
does
it
matter
i
should
like
to
know
said
hilliard
whose
excitement
had
passed
and
left
him
cold
and
i
should
like
to
know
who
told
you
before
that
i
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
drunk
are
you
drunk
now
or
not
not
in
the
way
you
mean
do
you
happen
to
know
a
man
called
narramore
never
heard
the
name
hilliard
felt
ashamed
of
his
ignoble
suspicion
he
became
silent
there
no
reason
why
you
should
be
told
added
dengate
it
was
a
friend
of
yours
at
dudley
that
i
came
across
when
i
was
making
inquiries
about
you
mullen
his
name
was
a
clerk
at
the
ironworks
with
whom
hilliard
had
been
on
terms
of
slight
intimacy
oh
that
fellow
he
uttered
carelessly
i
glad
to
know
it
was
no
one
else
why
did
you
go
inquiring
about
me
i
told
you
if
i
heard
a
better
account
i
should
have
done
a
good
deal
more
for
you
than
pay
that
money
i
gave
you
a
chance
too
if
you
shown
any
kind
of
decent
behaviour
when
i
spoke
to
you
in
the
train
but
it
no
good
talking
about
that
now
this
is
the
second
time
you
let
me
see
what
a
natural
blackguard
you
are
it
queer
too
you
did
get
that
from
your
father
i
could
have
put
you
in
the
way
of
something
good
at
liverpool
now
i
see
you
damned
first
well
have
you
run
through
the
money
every
penny
of
it
gone
in
drink
and
what
are
you
doing
walking
with
a
man
i
should
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
all
right
here
my
card
when
you
get
into
the
gutter
and
give
you
a
hand
out
let
me
know
with
a
nod
dengate
walked
off
hilliard
saw
him
smooth
his
silk
hat
as
he
went
then
without
glancing
at
the
card
he
threw
it
away
the
next
morning
was
cold
and
wet
he
lay
in
bed
till
eleven
when
the
charwoman
came
to
put
his
rooms
in
order
at
he
left
home
had
dinner
at
the
nearest
place
he
knew
where
a
meal
could
be
obtained
on
sunday
and
afterwards
walked
the
streets
for
an
hour
under
his
umbrella
the
exercise
did
him
good
on
returning
he
felt
able
to
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
turn
over
the
plates
of
his
great
book
on
french
cathedrals
this
at
all
events
remained
to
him
out
of
the
wreck
and
was
a
joy
that
could
be
counted
upon
in
days
to
come
he
hoped
narramore
would
keep
his
promise
and
was
not
disappointed
on
the
verge
of
dusk
his
friend
knocked
and
entered
the
blind
woman
was
at
the
door
below
he
explained
looking
for
somebody
it
is
as
absurd
as
it
sounds
she
does
look
for
people
with
her
ears
she
knows
a
footstep
that
no
one
else
can
hear
what
were
doing
at
dudley
yesterday
narramore
took
his
pipe
out
of
its
case
and
smiled
over
it
colours
well
does
it
he
remarked
you
do
care
about
the
colouring
of
a
pipe
i
get
a
lot
of
satisfaction
out
of
such
little
things
lazy
fellows
always
do
and
they
have
the
best
of
life
in
the
end
what
were
doing
at
dudley
had
to
go
over
with
a
girl
rather
a
pretty
girl
too
old
acquaintance
someone
i
got
to
know
in
london
no
no
not
at
all
what
you
suppose
well
i
know
you
would
talk
about
it
it
is
my
way
either
to
say
much
about
such
things
but
i
not
long
ago
to
let
you
know
of
something
that
was
going
on
if
it
came
to
anything
and
it
rather
looks
as
if
it
might
what
do
you
think
birching
has
been
at
me
wanting
to
know
why
i
do
call
i
wonder
whether
the
girl
put
him
up
to
it
you
went
rather
far
did
you
oh
i
drew
back
in
time
besides
those
ideas
are
have
to
be
understood
that
marriageable
girls
have
nothing
specially
sacred
about
them
they
must
associate
with
men
on
equal
terms
the
day
has
gone
by
for
a
hulking
brother
to
come
asking
a
man
about
his
as
a
rule
it
the
girl
that
has
intentions
the
man
is
just
looking
round
anxious
to
be
amiable
without
making
a
fool
of
himself
we
at
a
great
disadvantage
a
girl
who
is
an
idiot
can
very
soon
know
all
about
the
men
who
interest
her
but
it
devilish
difficult
to
get
much
insight
into
until
you
hopelessly
committed
yourself
wo
you
smoke
i
something
to
tell
you
and
i
ca
talk
to
a
man
who
is
smoking
when
my
own
pipe
lit
hilliard
obeyed
and
for
a
few
moments
they
puffed
in
silence
twilight
thickening
about
them
three
or
four
months
ago
resumed
narramore
i
was
told
one
day
at
business
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
me
i
happened
to
have
the
room
to
myself
and
told
them
to
show
the
lady
in
i
did
in
the
least
know
who
it
could
be
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
rather
a
girl
not
exactly
a
lady
tallish
and
with
fine
dark
eyes
what
did
you
say
nothing
a
twinge
of
gout
go
on
narramore
scrutinised
his
friend
who
spoke
in
an
unusual
tone
she
sat
down
and
began
to
tell
me
that
she
was
out
of
work
wanted
a
place
as
a
bookkeeper
or
something
of
the
kind
could
i
help
her
i
asked
her
why
she
came
to
she
said
she
had
heard
of
me
from
someone
who
used
to
be
employed
at
our
place
that
was
flattering
i
showed
my
sense
of
it
then
i
asked
her
name
and
she
said
it
was
miss
madeley
a
gust
threw
rain
against
the
windows
narramore
paused
looking
into
the
fire
and
smiling
thoughtfully
chapter
xxiii
you
foresee
the
course
of
the
narrative
better
tell
it
in
detail
muttered
hilliard
why
this
severe
tone
do
you
anticipate
something
that
will
shock
your
moral
sense
i
did
think
you
were
so
straitlaced
do
you
mean
to
say
hilliard
was
sitting
upright
his
voice
began
on
a
harsh
tremor
and
suddenly
failed
the
other
gazed
at
him
in
humorous
astonishment
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
even
suppose
who
made
you
a
judge
and
a
ruler
this
is
the
most
comical
start
i
known
for
a
long
time
i
was
going
to
tell
you
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
the
girl
i
see
it
all
right
but
do
you
really
mean
said
narramore
that
anything
else
would
have
aroused
your
moral
indignation
hilliard
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
his
pipe
fell
to
the
floor
and
broke
whereupon
he
interrupted
his
strange
merriment
with
a
savage
oath
it
was
a
joke
then
remarked
his
friend
your
monstrous
dulness
shows
the
state
of
your
mind
this
is
what
comes
of
getting
entangled
with
women
you
need
to
have
a
sense
of
humour
i
afraid
there
some
truth
in
what
you
say
old
boy
i
been
conscious
of
queer
symptoms
lately
a
disposition
to
take
things
with
absurd
seriousness
and
an
unwholesome
bodily
activity
now
and
then
go
on
with
your
tragic
story
the
girl
asked
you
to
find
her
a
place
i
promised
to
think
about
it
but
i
could
hear
of
anything
suitable
she
had
left
her
address
with
me
so
at
length
i
wrote
her
a
line
just
saying
i
had
forgotten
her
i
got
an
answer
on
paper
miss
madeley
wrote
to
tell
me
that
her
father
had
recently
died
and
that
she
had
found
employment
at
dudley
with
thanks
for
my
kindness
and
so
on
it
was
rather
a
nicely
written
letter
and
after
a
day
or
two
i
wrote
again
i
heard
nothing
hardly
expected
to
so
in
a
fortnight
time
i
wrote
once
more
significant
was
it
i
not
fond
of
writing
letters
as
you
know
but
i
written
a
good
many
since
then
at
last
it
came
to
another
meeting
i
went
over
to
dudley
on
purpose
and
saw
miss
madeley
on
the
castle
hill
i
had
liked
the
look
of
her
from
the
first
and
i
liked
it
still
better
now
by
dint
of
persuasion
i
made
her
tell
me
all
about
herself
did
she
tell
you
the
truth
why
should
you
suppose
she
did
replied
narramore
with
some
emphasis
you
must
look
at
this
affair
in
a
different
light
hilliard
a
joke
is
a
joke
but
i
told
you
that
the
joking
time
has
gone
by
i
can
make
allowance
for
you
you
think
i
have
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
after
all
the
beginning
was
ominous
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
yes
i
know
how
it
strikes
you
but
she
came
in
that
way
because
she
had
been
trying
for
months
who
was
it
that
told
her
of
you
oh
one
of
our
girls
no
doubt
i
have
asked
her
never
thought
again
about
it
and
what
her
record
nothing
dramatic
in
it
i
glad
to
say
at
one
time
she
had
an
engagement
in
london
for
a
year
or
two
her
people
but
honest
as
the
stories
put
it
father
was
a
timekeeper
at
dudley
brother
a
mechanic
there
i
was
over
to
see
her
yesterday
we
had
only
just
said
when
i
met
you
she
remarkably
well
educated
all
things
considered
very
fond
of
reading
knows
as
much
of
books
as
i
do
more
i
daresay
intelligence
i
guessed
that
from
the
first
i
can
see
the
drawbacks
of
course
as
i
said
she
is
what
would
call
a
lady
but
there
nothing
much
to
find
fault
with
even
in
her
manners
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
i
in
love
with
her
and
she
has
promised
to
marry
you
well
not
in
so
many
words
she
seems
to
have
scruples
difference
of
position
and
that
kind
of
thing
very
reasonable
scruples
no
doubt
quite
right
that
she
should
think
of
it
in
that
way
at
all
events
but
i
believe
it
was
practically
settled
yesterday
she
is
in
very
brilliant
health
poor
girl
i
want
to
get
her
away
from
that
beastly
place
as
soon
as
possible
i
shall
give
myself
a
longish
holiday
and
take
her
on
to
the
continent
a
thorough
change
of
that
kind
would
set
her
up
wonderfully
she
has
never
been
on
to
the
continent
what
a
preposterous
question
you
going
to
sleep
sitting
here
in
the
dark
oh
do
trouble
to
light
up
for
me
i
ca
stay
much
longer
hilliard
had
risen
but
instead
of
lighting
the
lamp
he
turned
to
the
window
and
stood
there
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
a
pane
are
you
seriously
concerned
for
me
said
his
friend
does
it
seem
a
piece
of
madness
you
must
judge
for
yourself
narramore
when
you
have
seen
her
i
think
you
take
my
views
of
course
the
very
last
thing
i
ever
imagined
myself
doing
but
i
begin
to
see
that
the
talk
about
fate
is
altogether
humbug
i
want
this
girl
for
my
wife
and
i
never
met
any
one
else
whom
i
really
want
she
suits
me
exactly
it
is
as
if
i
thought
of
marrying
an
ordinary
ignorant
girl
eve
that
her
name
is
very
much
out
of
the
common
look
at
her
how
you
may
she
rather
melancholy
but
that
a
natural
result
of
her
life
no
doubt
as
you
say
she
wants
a
thorough
change
remarked
hilliard
smiling
in
the
gloom
that
it
her
nerves
are
out
of
order
well
i
thought
i
should
like
to
tell
you
this
old
chap
you
get
over
the
shock
in
time
i
more
than
half
believe
still
that
your
moral
indignation
was
genuine
and
why
not
i
ought
to
respect
you
for
it
are
you
going
i
must
be
in
bristol
road
by
five
promised
to
drink
a
cup
of
stocker
tea
this
afternoon
i
glad
now
that
i
have
kept
up
a
few
homely
acquaintances
they
may
be
useful
of
course
i
shall
throw
over
the
birchings
and
that
lot
you
see
now
why
my
thoughts
have
been
running
on
a
country
house
he
went
off
laughing
and
his
friend
sat
down
again
by
the
fireside
half
an
hour
passed
the
fire
had
burnt
low
and
the
room
was
quite
dark
at
length
hilliard
bestirred
himself
he
lit
the
lamp
drew
down
the
blind
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
to
write
with
great
rapidity
he
covered
four
sides
of
and
addressed
an
envelope
but
he
had
no
it
could
be
obtained
at
a
tobacconist
so
he
went
out
and
turned
towards
a
little
shop
hard
by
but
when
he
had
stamped
the
letter
he
felt
undecided
about
posting
it
eve
had
promised
to
come
with
patty
if
she
again
failed
him
it
would
be
time
enough
to
write
if
she
kept
her
promise
the
presence
of
a
third
person
would
be
an
intolerable
restraint
upon
him
yet
why
patty
might
as
well
know
all
and
act
as
judge
between
them
there
needed
little
sagacity
to
arbitrate
in
a
matter
such
as
this
to
sit
at
home
was
impossible
he
walked
for
the
sake
of
walking
straight
on
without
object
down
the
long
perspective
of
bradford
street
with
its
closed
silent
workshops
across
the
miserable
little
river
rea
canal
rather
than
river
sewer
rather
than
canal
up
the
steep
ascent
to
martin
and
the
bull
ring
and
the
bronze
nelson
dripping
with
dirty
moisture
between
the
big
buildings
of
new
street
and
so
to
the
centre
of
the
town
at
the
corner
by
the
post
office
he
stood
in
idle
contemplation
rain
was
still
falling
but
lightly
the
great
open
space
gleamed
with
shafts
of
yellow
radiance
reflected
on
wet
asphalt
from
the
numerous
lamps
there
was
little
traffic
an
omnibus
clattered
by
and
a
tottery
cab
both
looking
near
the
statue
of
peel
stood
a
hansom
the
forlorn
horse
crooking
his
knees
and
hanging
his
hopeless
head
the
town
hall
colonnade
sheltered
a
crowd
of
people
who
were
waiting
for
the
rain
to
stop
that
they
might
spend
their
sunday
evening
as
usual
in
rambling
about
the
streets
within
the
building
which
showed
light
through
all
its
long
windows
a
religious
meeting
was
in
progress
and
hundreds
of
voices
peeled
forth
a
rousing
hymn
fortified
with
deeper
hilliard
noticed
that
as
fell
on
the
heated
globes
of
the
they
were
thrown
off
again
in
little
jets
and
puffs
of
steam
this
phenomenon
amused
him
for
several
minutes
he
wondered
that
he
had
never
observed
it
before
easter
sunday
the
day
had
its
importance
for
a
christian
mind
did
eve
think
about
that
perhaps
her
association
with
him
careless
as
he
was
in
all
such
matters
had
helped
to
blunt
her
religious
feeling
yet
what
hope
was
there
in
such
a
world
as
this
that
she
would
retain
the
pieties
of
her
girlhood
easter
sunday
as
he
walked
on
he
pondered
the
christian
story
and
tried
to
make
something
out
of
it
had
it
any
significance
for
perhaps
for
he
had
never
consciously
discarded
the
old
faith
he
had
simply
let
it
fall
out
of
his
mind
but
a
woman
ought
to
have
religious
convictions
yes
he
saw
the
necessity
of
that
better
for
him
if
eve
were
in
the
town
hall
yonder
joining
her
voice
with
those
that
sang
better
for
a
selfish
point
of
view
but
the
advantage
would
be
hers
also
did
he
not
desire
her
happiness
he
tried
to
think
so
but
after
all
was
ashamed
to
play
the
sophist
with
himself
the
letter
he
carried
in
his
pocket
told
the
truth
he
had
but
to
think
of
her
as
married
to
robert
narramore
and
the
jealous
fury
of
natural
man
drove
him
headlong
monday
was
again
a
holiday
when
would
the
cursed
people
get
back
to
their
toil
and
let
the
world
resume
its
wonted
grind
and
clang
they
seemed
to
have
been
making
holiday
for
a
month
past
he
walked
up
and
down
on
the
pavement
near
his
door
until
at
the
street
corner
there
appeared
a
figure
he
knew
it
was
patty
ringrose
again
unaccompanied
chapter
xxiv
they
shook
hands
without
a
word
their
eyes
meeting
for
an
instant
only
hilliard
led
the
way
upstairs
and
patty
still
keeping
an
embarrassed
silence
sat
down
on
the
her
complexion
was
as
noticeably
fresh
as
hilliard
was
wan
and
fatigued
where
patty
skin
showed
a
dimple
his
bore
a
gash
the
result
of
an
accident
in
shaving
this
morning
with
hands
behind
he
stood
in
front
of
the
girl
she
chose
not
to
come
then
yes
she
asked
me
to
come
and
see
you
alone
no
pretence
of
headache
this
time
i
do
think
it
was
a
pretence
faltered
patty
who
looked
very
ill
at
ease
for
all
the
bloom
on
her
cheeks
and
the
clear
childish
light
in
her
eyes
well
then
why
has
she
come
she
has
sent
a
letter
for
you
mr
hilliard
patty
handed
the
missive
and
hilliard
laid
it
upon
the
table
am
i
to
read
it
now
i
think
it
a
long
letter
feels
like
it
i
study
it
at
my
leisure
you
know
what
it
contains
patty
nodded
her
face
turned
away
and
why
has
she
chosen
to
write
to
me
patty
kept
silence
anything
to
do
with
the
call
i
had
yesterday
from
my
friend
narramore
yes
that
the
reason
but
she
has
meant
to
let
you
know
for
some
time
hilliard
drew
a
long
breath
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
letter
she
has
told
me
everything
the
girl
continued
speaking
hurriedly
did
you
know
about
it
before
yesterday
i
not
so
good
an
actor
as
all
that
eve
has
the
advantage
of
me
in
that
respect
she
really
thought
it
possible
that
narramore
had
spoken
before
she
could
be
sure
h
then
she
did
know
for
certain
that
narramore
was
going
to
talk
to
me
about
her
yesterday
she
knew
it
come
patty
our
friend
miss
madeley
is
a
very
sensible
person
do
you
think
so
you
must
think
she
made
a
plan
to
deceive
you
she
tells
you
all
about
it
in
the
letter
and
i
quite
sure
it
all
true
hilliard
i
was
astonished
when
i
heard
of
it
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
feel
i
not
at
all
sure
that
there
any
cause
for
sorrow
hilliard
interrupted
drawing
up
a
chair
and
throwing
himself
upon
it
unless
you
mean
that
you
are
sorry
for
eve
i
meant
that
as
well
let
us
understand
each
other
how
much
has
she
told
you
everything
from
beginning
to
end
i
had
no
idea
of
what
happened
in
london
before
we
went
to
paris
and
she
does
so
repent
of
it
she
does
know
how
she
could
do
it
she
wishes
you
had
refused
her
so
do
i
but
you
saved
her
she
can
never
forget
that
you
must
think
that
she
only
pretends
to
be
grateful
she
will
be
grateful
to
you
as
long
as
she
lives
i
know
she
will
on
condition
that
i
what
patty
gave
him
a
bewildered
look
what
does
she
ask
of
me
now
she
ashamed
to
ask
anything
she
fears
you
will
never
speak
to
her
again
hilliard
meditated
then
glanced
at
the
letter
i
had
better
read
this
now
i
think
if
you
will
let
me
yes
please
do
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
disclosed
two
sheets
of
covered
with
writing
for
several
minutes
there
was
silence
patty
now
and
then
gave
a
furtive
glance
at
her
companion
face
as
he
was
reading
at
length
he
put
the
letter
down
again
softly
there
something
more
here
than
i
expected
can
you
tell
me
whether
she
heard
from
narramore
this
morning
she
has
had
no
letter
i
see
and
what
does
she
suppose
passed
between
narramore
and
me
yesterday
she
is
wondering
what
you
told
him
she
takes
it
for
granted
in
this
letter
that
i
have
put
an
end
to
everything
between
them
well
had
i
a
right
to
do
so
of
course
you
had
patty
replied
with
emphasis
and
she
knew
it
must
come
she
never
really
thought
that
she
could
marry
narramore
she
gave
him
no
promise
only
corresponded
with
him
and
made
appointments
with
him
and
allowed
him
to
feel
sure
that
she
would
be
his
wife
eve
has
behaved
very
strangely
i
ca
understand
her
she
ought
to
have
told
you
that
she
had
been
to
see
him
and
that
he
wrote
to
her
it
always
best
to
be
straightforward
see
what
trouble
she
has
got
herself
into
hilliard
took
up
the
letter
again
and
again
there
was
a
long
silence
have
you
said
to
her
were
his
next
words
she
going
to
meet
me
at
the
station
to
see
me
off
did
she
come
from
dudley
with
you
no
it
all
very
well
to
make
use
of
you
for
this
disagreeable
business
oh
i
did
mind
it
broke
in
patty
with
irrelevant
cheerfulness
a
woman
does
such
things
as
this
should
have
the
courage
to
go
through
with
it
she
ought
to
have
come
herself
and
have
told
me
that
she
was
aiming
at
much
better
things
than
could
have
promised
her
there
would
have
been
something
to
admire
in
that
the
worst
of
it
is
she
is
making
me
feel
ashamed
of
her
i
rather
have
to
do
with
a
woman
who
did
care
a
rap
for
my
feelings
than
with
a
weak
one
who
tried
to
spare
me
to
advantage
herself
at
the
same
time
nothing
like
courage
whether
in
good
or
evil
what
do
you
think
does
she
like
narramore
i
think
she
does
faltered
patty
nervously
striking
her
dress
is
she
in
love
with
him
i
i
really
do
know
do
you
think
she
ever
was
in
love
with
anyone
or
ever
will
be
patty
sat
mute
just
tell
me
what
you
think
i
afraid
she
never
oh
i
do
like
to
say
it
mr
hilliard
that
she
never
was
in
love
with
i
know
it
his
tone
caused
patty
to
look
up
at
him
and
what
she
saw
in
his
face
made
her
say
quickly
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
indeed
you
deserve
never
mind
what
i
deserve
hilliard
interrupted
with
a
grim
smile
something
less
than
hanging
i
hope
that
fellow
in
london
she
was
fond
of
the
girl
whispered
an
assent
a
pity
i
interfered
ah
but
think
what
we
wo
discuss
it
patty
it
a
horrible
thing
to
be
mad
about
a
girl
who
cares
no
more
for
you
than
for
an
old
glove
but
it
a
part
to
try
to
win
her
by
the
way
of
gratitude
when
we
came
back
from
paris
i
ought
to
have
gone
my
way
and
left
her
to
go
hers
perhaps
just
possible
if
i
had
seemed
to
think
no
more
of
her
patty
waited
but
he
did
not
finish
his
speech
what
are
you
going
to
do
mr
hilliard
yes
that
the
question
shall
i
hold
her
to
her
promise
she
says
here
that
she
will
keep
her
word
if
i
demand
it
she
says
that
patty
exclaimed
with
startled
eyes
did
you
know
she
told
me
it
was
impossible
but
perhaps
she
did
mean
it
who
can
tell
she
means
for
the
first
time
there
sounded
a
petulance
in
the
girl
voice
her
lips
closed
tightly
and
she
tapped
with
her
foot
on
the
floor
did
she
say
that
the
other
thing
was
also
impossible
to
marry
narramore
she
thinks
it
is
after
what
you
told
him
well
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
told
him
nothing
patty
stared
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
you
told
him
nothing
i
just
let
him
suppose
that
i
had
never
heard
the
girl
name
before
oh
how
kind
of
you
how
please
to
remember
that
it
was
very
easy
to
tell
the
truth
what
sort
of
figure
should
i
have
made
it
too
bad
of
eve
it
cruel
i
can
never
like
her
as
i
did
before
oh
she
very
interesting
she
gives
one
such
a
lot
to
talk
about
i
do
like
her
and
i
shall
tell
her
so
before
i
leave
birmingham
what
right
has
she
to
make
people
so
miserable
only
one
after
all
do
you
mean
that
you
will
let
her
marry
mr
narramore
patty
asked
with
interest
we
shall
have
to
talk
about
that
if
i
were
you
i
should
never
see
her
again
the
probability
is
that
we
shall
see
each
other
many
a
time
then
have
much
courage
mr
hilliard
exclaimed
the
girl
with
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
more
than
you
think
perhaps
he
answered
between
his
teeth
men
are
very
strange
patty
commented
in
a
low
voice
of
scorn
mitigated
by
timidity
yes
we
play
queer
pranks
when
a
woman
has
made
a
slave
of
us
i
suppose
you
think
i
should
have
too
much
pride
to
care
any
more
for
her
the
truth
is
that
for
years
to
come
i
shall
tremble
all
through
whenever
she
is
near
me
such
love
as
i
have
felt
for
eve
wo
be
trampled
out
like
a
spark
it
the
best
and
the
worst
part
of
my
life
no
woman
can
ever
be
to
me
what
eve
is
abashed
by
the
grave
force
of
this
utterance
patty
shrank
back
into
the
chair
and
held
her
peace
you
will
very
soon
know
what
conies
of
it
all
hilliard
continued
with
a
sudden
change
of
voice
it
has
to
be
decided
pretty
quickly
one
way
or
another
may
i
tell
eve
what
you
have
said
to
me
the
girl
asked
with
diffidence
yes
anything
that
i
have
said
patty
lingered
a
little
then
as
her
companion
said
no
more
she
rose
i
must
say
mr
hilliard
i
am
afraid
your
holiday
has
been
as
pleasant
as
you
expected
oh
i
have
enjoyed
myself
very
much
and
i
hope
her
voice
wavered
i
do
hope
it
be
all
right
i
sure
you
do
what
seems
best
i
shall
do
what
i
find
myself
obliged
to
patty
i
offer
to
go
with
you
for
i
should
be
poor
company
he
conducted
her
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
again
shook
hands
with
her
put
all
his
goodwill
into
a
smile
and
watched
her
trip
away
with
a
step
not
so
light
as
usual
then
he
returned
to
eve
letter
it
gave
him
a
detailed
account
of
her
relations
with
narramore
i
went
to
him
because
i
could
bear
to
live
idle
any
longer
i
had
no
other
thought
in
my
mind
if
he
had
been
the
means
of
my
finding
work
i
should
have
confessed
it
to
you
at
once
but
i
was
tempted
into
answering
his
letters
i
knew
i
was
behaving
wrongly
i
ca
defend
myself
i
have
never
concealed
my
faults
from
you
the
greatest
of
them
is
my
fear
of
poverty
i
believe
it
is
this
that
has
prevented
me
from
returning
your
love
as
i
wished
to
do
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
playing
a
deceitful
part
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
i
my
exposure
might
come
at
any
moment
i
seem
to
have
been
led
on
by
a
sort
of
despair
now
i
am
tired
of
it
whether
you
were
prepared
for
this
or
not
i
must
tell
you
i
do
ask
you
to
release
me
i
have
been
wronging
you
and
acting
against
my
conscience
and
if
you
can
forgive
me
i
will
try
to
make
up
for
the
ill
i
have
done
how
much
of
this
could
he
believe
gladly
he
would
have
fooled
himself
into
believing
it
all
but
the
rational
soul
in
him
cast
out
credulity
every
phrase
of
the
letter
was
calculated
for
its
impression
and
the
very
risk
she
had
run
was
not
that
too
a
matter
of
deliberate
speculation
she
succeed
in
her
design
upon
narramore
if
she
failed
the
man
was
still
to
be
counted
upon
for
she
knew
the
extent
of
her
power
over
him
it
was
worth
the
endeavour
perhaps
in
her
insolent
she
did
not
fear
the
effect
on
narramore
of
the
disclosure
that
might
be
made
to
him
and
who
could
say
that
her
boldness
was
not
likely
to
be
justified
he
burned
with
wrath
against
her
the
wrath
of
a
hopelessly
infatuated
man
thoughts
of
revenge
no
matter
how
ignoble
harassed
his
mind
she
counted
on
his
slavish
spirit
and
even
in
saying
that
she
did
not
ask
him
to
release
her
she
saw
herself
already
released
at
each
reperusal
of
her
letter
he
felt
more
resolved
to
disappoint
the
hope
that
inspired
it
when
she
learnt
from
patty
that
narramore
was
still
ignorant
of
her
history
how
would
she
exult
but
that
joy
should
be
brief
in
the
name
of
common
honesty
he
would
protect
his
friend
if
narramore
chose
to
take
her
with
his
eyes
open
jealous
frenzy
kept
him
pacing
the
room
for
an
hour
or
two
then
he
went
forth
and
haunted
the
neighbourhood
of
new
street
station
until
within
five
minutes
of
the
time
of
departure
of
patty
train
if
eve
kept
her
promise
to
see
the
girl
off
he
might
surprise
her
upon
the
platform
from
the
bridge
crossing
the
lines
he
surveyed
the
crowd
of
people
that
waited
by
the
london
train
a
train
taking
back
a
freight
of
excursionists
he
discovered
eve
noted
her
position
descended
to
the
platform
and
got
as
near
to
her
as
possible
the
train
moved
off
as
eve
turned
away
among
the
dispersing
people
he
stepped
to
meet
her
chapter
xxv
she
gave
no
sign
of
surprise
hilliard
read
in
her
face
that
she
had
prepared
herself
for
this
encounter
come
away
where
we
can
talk
he
said
abruptly
she
walked
by
him
to
a
part
of
the
station
where
only
a
porter
passed
occasionally
the
echoings
beneath
the
vaulted
roof
allowed
them
to
speak
without
constraint
for
their
voices
were
inaudible
a
yard
or
two
off
hilliard
would
not
look
into
her
face
lest
he
should
be
softened
to
foolish
clemency
it
very
kind
of
you
he
began
with
no
clear
purpose
save
the
desire
of
harsh
speech
to
ask
me
to
overlook
this
trifle
and
let
things
be
as
before
i
have
said
all
i
say
in
the
letter
i
deserve
all
your
anger
that
was
the
note
he
dreaded
the
too
well
remembered
note
of
pathetic
submission
it
reminded
him
with
intolerable
force
that
he
had
never
held
her
by
any
bond
save
that
of
her
gratitude
do
you
really
imagine
he
exclaimed
that
i
could
go
on
with
that
i
could
bring
myself
to
put
faith
in
you
again
for
a
moment
i
do
ask
you
to
eve
replied
in
firmer
accents
i
have
lost
what
little
respect
you
could
ever
feel
for
me
i
might
have
repaid
you
with
honesty
i
did
do
even
that
say
the
worst
you
can
of
me
and
i
shall
think
still
worse
of
myself
the
voice
overcame
him
with
a
conviction
of
her
sincerity
and
he
gazed
at
her
marvelling
are
you
honest
anyone
would
think
so
yet
how
am
i
to
believe
it
eve
met
his
eyes
steadily
i
will
never
again
say
one
word
to
you
that
is
pure
truth
i
am
at
your
mercy
and
you
may
punish
me
as
you
like
there
only
one
way
in
which
i
can
punish
you
for
the
loss
of
respect
or
of
my
love
you
care
nothing
if
i
bring
myself
to
tell
narramore
disagreeable
things
about
you
you
will
suffer
a
disappointment
and
that
all
the
cost
to
me
will
be
much
greater
and
you
know
it
you
pity
yourself
you
regard
me
as
holding
you
ungenerously
by
an
advantage
you
once
gave
me
it
is
so
at
all
it
is
i
who
have
been
held
by
bonds
i
could
break
and
from
the
day
when
you
pretended
a
love
you
never
felt
all
the
blame
lay
with
you
what
could
i
do
be
truthful
that
was
all
you
were
not
content
with
the
truth
you
forced
me
to
think
that
i
could
love
you
only
remember
what
passed
between
us
honesty
was
still
possible
when
you
came
to
know
yourself
better
you
should
have
said
to
me
in
so
many
words
ca
look
forward
to
our
future
with
any
courage
if
i
marry
it
must
be
a
man
who
has
more
to
offer
do
you
think
i
could
have
endured
to
hear
that
you
have
never
understood
me
i
should
have
said
let
us
shake
hands
and
i
am
your
friend
to
help
you
all
i
can
you
say
that
i
should
have
said
it
at
any
time
but
i
am
not
so
mean
as
you
think
me
if
i
loved
a
man
i
could
face
poverty
with
him
much
as
i
hate
and
dread
it
it
was
because
i
only
liked
you
and
could
not
feel
more
your
love
happens
to
fall
upon
a
man
who
has
solid
possessions
it
easy
to
speak
so
scornfully
i
have
not
pretended
to
love
the
man
you
mean
yet
you
have
brought
him
to
think
that
you
are
willing
to
marry
him
without
any
word
of
love
from
me
if
i
had
been
free
i
would
have
married
him
just
because
i
am
sick
of
the
life
i
lead
and
long
for
the
kind
of
life
he
offered
me
when
it
too
late
you
are
frank
enough
despise
me
as
much
as
you
like
you
want
the
truth
and
you
shall
hear
nothing
else
from
me
well
we
get
near
to
understanding
each
other
but
it
astonishes
me
that
you
spoilt
your
excellent
chance
how
could
you
hope
to
carry
through
this
eve
broke
in
impatiently
i
told
you
in
the
letter
that
i
had
no
hope
of
it
it
your
mistake
to
think
me
a
crafty
plotting
selfish
woman
i
only
a
very
miserable
one
it
went
on
from
this
to
that
and
i
meant
nothing
i
did
scheme
i
was
only
tempted
into
foolishness
i
felt
myself
getting
into
difficulties
that
would
be
my
ruin
but
i
had
strength
to
draw
back
you
do
yourself
injustice
said
hilliard
coldly
for
the
past
month
you
have
acted
a
part
before
me
and
acted
it
well
you
seemed
to
be
reconciling
yourself
to
my
prospects
indifferent
as
they
were
you
encouraged
me
talked
with
unusual
cheerfulness
showed
a
bright
face
if
this
was
deliberate
acting
what
did
it
mean
yes
it
was
put
on
eve
admitted
after
a
pause
but
i
could
help
that
i
was
obliged
to
keep
seeing
you
and
if
i
had
looked
as
miserable
as
i
felt
she
broke
off
i
tried
to
behave
just
like
a
friend
you
ca
charge
me
with
pretending
anything
else
i
be
your
friend
that
was
honest
feeling
it
no
use
to
me
i
must
have
more
or
nothing
the
flood
of
passion
surged
in
him
again
some
trick
of
her
voice
or
some
indescribable
movement
of
her
head
the
trifles
which
are
over
a
man
in
love
beat
down
his
contending
reason
you
say
he
continued
that
you
will
make
amends
for
your
unfair
dealing
if
you
mean
it
take
the
only
course
that
shows
itself
confess
to
narramore
what
you
have
done
you
owe
it
to
him
as
much
as
to
me
i
ca
do
that
said
eve
drawing
away
it
for
you
to
tell
him
if
you
like
no
i
had
my
opportunity
and
let
it
pass
i
do
mean
that
you
are
to
inform
him
of
all
there
has
been
between
us
that
needless
we
have
agreed
to
forget
everything
that
suggests
the
word
i
hate
but
that
you
and
i
have
been
lovers
and
looked
i
at
all
events
to
be
something
more
this
you
must
let
him
know
i
can
never
do
that
without
it
how
are
you
to
disentangle
yourself
i
promise
you
he
shall
see
no
more
of
me
such
a
promise
is
idle
and
you
know
it
remember
too
that
narramore
and
i
are
friends
he
will
speak
to
me
of
you
and
i
ca
play
a
farce
with
him
it
would
be
intolerable
discomfort
to
me
and
grossly
unfair
to
him
do
for
once
the
simple
honourable
thing
and
make
a
new
beginning
after
that
be
guided
by
your
own
interests
assuredly
i
shall
not
stand
in
your
way
eve
had
turned
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
crowd
and
bustle
when
she
faced
hilliard
again
he
saw
that
she
had
come
to
a
resolve
there
only
one
way
out
of
it
for
me
she
said
impulsively
i
talk
any
longer
i
write
to
you
she
moved
from
him
hilliard
followed
at
a
distance
of
yards
just
as
he
was
about
to
address
her
again
she
stopped
and
spoke
you
hate
to
hear
me
talk
of
i
have
always
meant
by
it
less
than
you
thought
i
was
grateful
for
the
money
not
for
anything
else
when
you
took
me
away
perhaps
it
was
the
unkindest
thing
you
could
have
done
an
unwonted
vehemence
shook
her
voice
her
muscles
were
tense
she
stood
in
an
attitude
of
rebellious
pride
if
i
had
been
true
to
myself
then
but
it
is
too
late
if
i
am
to
act
honestly
i
know
very
well
what
i
must
do
i
will
take
your
advice
hilliard
could
not
doubt
of
her
meaning
he
remembered
his
last
talk
with
patty
this
was
a
declaration
he
had
not
foreseen
and
it
affected
him
otherwise
than
he
could
have
anticipated
my
advice
had
nothing
to
do
with
was
his
answer
as
he
read
her
face
but
i
shall
say
not
a
word
against
it
i
could
respect
you
at
all
events
yes
and
i
had
rather
have
your
respect
than
your
love
with
that
she
left
him
he
wished
to
pursue
but
a
physical
languor
held
him
motionless
and
when
at
length
he
sauntered
from
the
place
it
was
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
at
what
had
happened
let
her
carry
out
that
purpose
he
faced
it
preferred
it
let
her
be
lost
to
him
in
that
way
rather
than
any
other
it
cut
the
knot
and
left
him
with
a
memory
of
eve
that
would
not
efface
her
dishonouring
weakness
late
at
night
he
walked
about
the
streets
near
his
home
debating
with
himself
whether
she
would
act
as
she
spoke
or
had
only
sought
to
frighten
him
with
a
threat
and
still
he
hoped
that
her
resolve
was
sincere
he
could
bear
that
conclusion
of
their
story
better
than
any
other
unless
it
were
her
death
better
a
thousand
times
than
her
marriage
with
narramore
in
the
morning
fatigue
gave
voice
to
conscience
he
had
bidden
her
go
when
perchance
a
word
would
have
checked
her
should
he
write
or
even
go
to
her
straightway
and
retract
what
he
had
said
his
will
prevailed
and
he
did
nothing
the
night
that
followed
plagued
him
with
other
misgivings
it
seemed
more
probable
now
that
she
had
threatened
what
she
would
never
have
the
courage
to
perform
she
meant
it
at
the
moment
it
declared
a
truth
but
an
hour
after
she
would
listen
to
commonplace
morality
or
prudence
narramore
would
write
to
her
she
might
perhaps
see
him
again
she
would
cling
to
the
baser
hope
might
but
the
morrow
bring
him
a
letter
from
london
it
brought
nothing
and
day
after
day
disappointed
him
more
than
a
week
passed
he
was
ill
with
suspense
but
could
take
no
step
for
setting
his
mind
at
rest
then
as
he
sat
one
morning
at
his
work
in
the
architect
office
there
arrived
a
telegram
addressed
to
him
i
must
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
be
here
before
narramore
chapter
xxvi
what
the
devil
does
this
mean
hilliard
if
never
before
the
indolent
man
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
he
had
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
hilliard
standing
before
him
in
a
little
office
that
smelt
of
ledgers
and
gum
and
many
other
commercial
things
knew
that
the
letter
must
be
from
eve
and
savagely
hoped
that
it
was
dated
london
this
is
from
miss
madeley
and
it
all
about
you
why
could
you
speak
the
other
day
what
does
she
say
about
me
that
she
has
known
you
for
a
long
time
that
you
saw
a
great
deal
of
each
other
in
london
that
she
has
led
you
on
with
a
hope
of
marrying
her
though
she
never
really
meant
it
in
short
that
she
has
used
you
very
ill
and
feels
obliged
now
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
the
listener
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
but
without
seeing
it
a
grim
smile
began
to
contort
his
lips
where
does
she
write
from
from
her
ordinary
address
why
not
i
think
this
is
rather
too
bad
of
you
why
did
you
speak
instead
of
writhing
about
and
sputtering
that
kind
of
thing
is
all
very
well
sense
of
honour
and
all
that
but
it
meant
that
i
was
being
taken
in
between
friends
hang
it
of
course
i
have
done
with
her
i
shall
write
at
once
it
amazing
it
took
away
my
breath
no
doubt
though
she
does
say
it
it
was
from
you
that
she
came
to
know
of
me
she
began
with
a
lie
and
who
the
devil
could
have
thought
it
her
face
her
way
of
talking
this
will
cut
me
up
awfully
of
course
i
sorry
for
you
too
but
it
was
your
plain
duty
to
let
me
know
what
sort
of
a
woman
i
had
got
hold
of
nay
it
she
that
has
got
hold
of
me
confound
her
i
do
feel
myself
thoroughly
knocked
over
hilliard
began
humming
an
air
he
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
have
you
seen
her
since
that
saturday
no
she
has
made
excuses
and
i
guessed
something
was
wrong
what
has
been
going
on
have
seen
her
of
course
narramore
glared
it
devilish
underhand
behaviour
look
here
old
fellow
we
nut
going
to
quarrel
no
woman
is
worth
a
quarrel
between
two
old
friends
but
just
speak
out
ca
you
what
did
you
mean
by
keeping
it
from
me
it
meant
that
i
had
nothing
to
say
hilliard
replied
through
his
moustache
you
kept
silence
out
of
spite
then
you
said
to
yourself
him
marry
her
and
find
out
afterwards
what
she
really
is
nothing
of
the
kind
he
looked
up
frankly
i
saw
no
reason
for
speaking
she
accuses
herself
without
a
shadow
of
reason
it
mere
hysterical
conscientiousness
we
have
known
each
other
for
half
a
year
or
so
and
i
have
made
love
to
her
but
i
never
had
the
least
encouragement
i
knew
all
along
she
did
care
for
me
how
is
she
to
blame
a
girl
is
under
no
obligation
to
speak
of
all
the
men
who
have
wanted
to
marry
her
provided
she
has
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
there
just
one
bit
of
insincerity
it
true
she
knew
of
you
from
me
but
she
looked
you
up
because
she
despaired
of
finding
employment
she
was
at
an
end
of
her
money
did
know
what
to
do
i
have
heard
this
since
i
saw
you
last
it
was
quite
straightforward
but
one
can
forgive
it
in
a
girl
hard
driven
by
necessity
narramore
was
listening
with
eagerness
his
lips
parted
and
a
growing
hope
in
his
eyes
there
never
was
anything
serious
between
you
on
her
side
never
for
a
moment
i
pursued
and
pestered
her
that
was
all
do
you
mind
telling
me
who
the
girl
was
that
i
saw
you
with
at
dudley
a
friend
of
miss
madeley
over
here
from
london
on
a
holiday
i
have
tried
to
make
use
of
her
to
get
her
influence
on
my
side
narramore
sprang
from
the
corner
of
the
table
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
why
could
she
hold
her
tongue
that
just
like
a
woman
to
keep
a
thing
quiet
when
she
ought
to
speak
of
it
and
bring
it
out
when
she
had
far
better
say
nothing
i
feel
as
if
i
had
treated
you
badly
hilliard
and
the
way
you
take
it
i
rather
you
eased
your
mind
by
swearing
at
me
i
could
swear
hard
enough
i
could
grip
you
by
the
throat
and
jump
on
you
no
i
hanged
if
you
could
he
forced
a
laugh
and
i
advise
you
to
try
here
give
me
your
hand
instead
he
seized
it
we
going
to
talk
this
over
like
two
reasonable
beings
does
this
girl
know
her
own
mind
it
seems
to
me
from
this
letter
that
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
you
must
find
out
whether
she
does
or
not
do
you
she
does
i
refuse
to
think
about
it
at
all
you
mean
she
is
worth
troubling
about
tell
the
truth
and
be
hanged
to
you
is
she
the
kind
of
a
girl
a
man
may
marry
for
all
i
know
do
you
suspect
her
narramore
urged
fiercely
she
marry
a
rich
man
rather
than
a
poor
one
that
the
worst
i
think
of
her
what
woman
wo
when
question
and
answer
had
revolved
about
this
point
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
hilliard
brought
the
dialogue
to
an
end
he
was
and
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
you
must
make
her
out
without
any
more
help
from
me
i
tell
you
the
letter
is
all
nonsense
and
i
can
say
no
more
he
moved
towards
the
exit
one
thing
i
must
know
hilliard
are
you
going
to
see
her
again
never
if
i
can
help
it
can
we
be
friends
still
if
you
never
mention
her
name
to
me
again
they
shook
hands
eyes
crossing
in
a
smile
of
shamed
hostility
and
the
parting
was
for
more
than
a
twelvemonth
late
in
august
when
hilliard
was
thinking
of
a
week
rest
in
the
country
after
a
spell
of
harder
and
more
successful
work
than
he
had
ever
previously
known
he
received
a
letter
from
patty
ringrose
dear
hilliard
wrote
the
girl
i
have
just
heard
from
eve
that
she
is
to
be
married
to
narramore
in
a
week
time
she
says
you
do
know
about
it
but
i
think
you
to
know
i
have
been
able
to
make
anything
of
her
two
last
letters
but
she
has
written
plainly
at
last
perhaps
she
means
me
to
tell
you
will
you
let
me
have
a
line
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
care
much
and
i
do
so
hope
you
do
i
felt
sure
it
would
come
to
this
and
if
you
believe
me
it
just
as
well
i
have
answered
her
letter
and
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
i
might
say
disagreeable
things
everything
is
the
same
with
me
and
always
will
be
i
suppose
in
conclusion
she
was
his
sincerely
a
postscript
remarked
they
tell
me
i
play
better
been
practising
a
great
deal
just
to
kill
the
time
dear
miss
ringrose
he
responded
i
am
very
glad
to
know
that
eve
is
to
be
comfortably
settled
for
life
by
all
means
answer
her
letter
and
by
all
means
keep
from
saying
disagreeable
things
it
is
never
wise
to
quarrel
with
prosperous
friends
and
why
should
you
with
every
good
wish
he
remained
sincerely
hers
chapter
xxvii
when
hilliard
and
his
friend
again
shook
hands
it
was
the
autumn
of
another
year
not
even
by
chance
had
they
encountered
in
the
interval
and
no
written
message
had
passed
between
them
their
meeting
was
at
a
house
newly
acquired
by
the
younger
of
the
birching
brothers
who
being
about
to
marry
summoned
his
bachelor
familiars
to
smoke
their
pipes
in
the
suburban
abode
while
yet
his
rule
there
was
undisputed
with
narramore
he
had
of
late
resumed
the
friendship
interrupted
by
miss
birching
displeasure
for
that
somewhat
imperious
young
lady
now
the
wife
of
an
elderly
ironmaster
moved
in
other
circles
and
hilliard
professional
value
which
was
beginning
to
be
recognised
by
the
birchings
otherwise
than
in
the
way
of
compliment
had
overcome
the
restraints
at
first
imposed
by
his
dubious
social
standing
they
met
genially
without
a
hint
of
estrangement
your
wife
well
hilliard
took
an
opportunity
of
asking
apart
thanks
she
getting
all
right
again
at
llandudno
just
now
glad
to
see
that
you
looking
so
uncommonly
fit
hilliard
had
undoubtedly
improved
in
personal
appearance
he
grew
a
beard
which
added
to
his
seeming
age
but
suited
with
his
features
his
carriage
was
more
upright
than
of
old
a
week
or
two
after
this
narramore
sent
a
friendly
note
shall
i
see
you
at
birching
on
sunday
my
wife
will
be
there
to
meet
miss
marks
and
some
other
people
come
if
you
can
old
fellow
i
should
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
and
hilliard
went
in
the
hall
he
was
confronted
by
narramore
who
shook
hands
with
him
rather
effusively
and
said
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
she
out
in
the
garden
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
awfully
good
of
you
old
boy
had
to
come
sooner
or
later
you
know
not
quite
assured
of
this
necessity
and
something
less
than
composed
hilliard
presently
passed
through
the
house
into
the
large
walled
garden
behind
it
here
he
was
confusedly
aware
of
a
group
of
ladies
not
one
of
whom
on
drawing
nearer
did
he
recognise
a
succession
of
formalities
discharged
he
heard
his
friend
voice
saying
hilliard
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
wife
there
before
him
stood
eve
he
had
only
just
persuaded
himself
of
her
identity
his
eyes
searched
her
countenance
with
wonder
which
barely
allowed
him
to
assume
a
becoming
attitude
but
narramore
was
perfect
in
society
drill
she
smiled
very
sweetly
gave
her
hand
said
what
the
occasion
demanded
among
the
women
present
all
well
bred
she
suffered
no
obscurement
her
voice
was
tuned
to
the
appropriate
harmony
her
talk
invited
to
an
avoidance
of
the
hackneyed
hilliard
revived
his
memories
of
gower
place
of
the
streets
of
paris
nothing
preternatural
had
come
about
nothing
that
he
had
not
forecasted
in
his
hours
of
hope
but
there
were
incidents
in
the
past
which
this
moment
blurred
away
into
the
region
of
dreamland
and
which
he
shrank
from
the
effort
of
reinvesting
with
credibility
this
is
a
pleasant
garden
eve
had
approached
him
as
he
stood
musing
after
a
conversation
with
other
ladies
rather
new
of
course
but
a
year
will
do
wonders
have
you
seen
the
chrysanthemums
she
led
him
apart
as
they
stood
regarding
the
flowers
hilliard
was
surprised
by
words
that
fell
from
her
your
contempt
for
me
is
beyond
expression
is
it
it
is
the
last
feeling
i
should
associate
with
you
he
answered
oh
but
be
sincere
we
have
both
learnt
to
speak
another
language
you
no
less
than
i
let
me
hear
a
word
such
as
you
used
to
speak
i
know
you
despise
me
unutterably
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
admire
you
very
much
what
my
skill
or
my
dress
everything
you
have
become
precisely
what
you
were
meant
to
be
oh
the
scorn
of
that
i
beg
you
not
to
think
it
for
a
moment
there
was
a
time
when
i
might
have
found
a
foolish
pleasure
in
speaking
to
you
with
sarcasm
but
that
has
long
gone
by
what
am
i
then
an
english
lady
with
rather
more
intellect
than
most
eve
flushed
with
satisfaction
it
more
than
kind
of
you
to
say
that
but
you
always
had
a
generous
spirit
i
never
thanked
you
not
one
poor
word
i
was
cowardly
afraid
to
write
and
you
did
care
for
my
thanks
i
do
now
then
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
again
and
again
her
voice
trembled
under
fulness
of
meaning
you
find
life
pleasant
you
do
i
hope
she
answered
as
they
paced
on
not
unpleasant
at
all
events
i
am
no
longer
slaving
under
the
iron
gods
i
like
my
work
and
it
promises
to
reward
me
eve
made
a
remark
about
a
then
her
voice
subdued
again
how
do
you
look
back
on
your
great
venture
your
attempt
to
make
the
most
that
could
be
made
of
a
year
in
your
life
quite
contentedly
it
was
worth
doing
and
is
worth
remembering
remember
if
you
care
to
eve
resumed
that
all
i
am
and
have
i
owe
to
you
i
was
all
but
lost
all
but
a
miserable
captive
for
the
rest
of
my
life
you
came
and
ransomed
me
a
less
generous
man
would
have
spoilt
his
work
at
the
last
moment
but
you
were
large
minded
enough
to
support
my
weakness
till
i
was
safe
hilliard
smiled
for
answer
you
and
robert
are
friends
again
perfectly
she
turned
and
they
rejoined
the
company
a
week
later
hilliard
went
down
into
the
country
to
a
quiet
spot
where
he
now
and
then
refreshed
his
mind
after
toil
in
birmingham
he
slept
at
a
cottage
and
on
the
sunday
morning
walked
idly
about
the
lanes
a
white
frost
had
suddenly
hastened
the
slow
decay
of
mellow
autumn
low
on
the
landscape
lay
a
soft
mist
dense
enough
to
conceal
everything
at
twenty
yards
away
but
suffused
with
golden
sunlight
overhead
shone
the
clear
blue
sky
roadside
trees
and
hedges
their
rich
tints
softened
by
the
medium
through
which
they
were
discerned
threw
shadows
of
exquisite
faintness
a
perfect
quiet
possessed
the
air
but
from
every
branch
as
though
shaken
by
some
invisible
hand
dead
foliage
dropped
to
earth
in
a
continuous
shower
softly
pattering
from
beech
to
maple
or
with
the
heavier
fall
of
while
at
long
intervals
sounded
the
thud
of
apples
tumbling
from
a
berries
arrayed
the
hawthorns
the
briar
was
rich
in
scarlet
fruit
everywhere
the
frost
had
left
the
adornment
of
its
subtle
artistry
each
leaf
upon
the
hedge
shone
spiders
webs
woven
from
stein
to
stem
glistened
in
the
morning
radiance
the
grasses
by
the
way
side
stood
stark
in
gleaming
mail
and
maurice
hilliard
a
free
man
in
his
own
conceit
sang
to
himself
a
song
of
the
joy
of
life
the
end
