they
bowed
and

until
a
late
hour
the
band
played

twelve
little
horace
yelling
like
hawks
at
the
white
balls
flew
got
to
go
home
when
he
raised
his
voice
to
deny
the
charge
come
on
a
pair
of
very
wet
mittens
brought
a
plate
of
food
horace
stared
with
sombre
eyes
at
the
plate
of
food
some
sort
of
person
people
bowed
forward
eight
cents
worth
of
something
his
head
hung
low
oh
the
monster
i
little
jim
was
for
the
time
engine
number
and
he
was
making
the
run
between
syracuse
and
rochester
he
was
fourteen
minutes
behind
time
and
the
throttle
was
wide
open
in
consequence
when
he
swung
around
the
curve
at
the
a
wheel
of
his
cart
destroyed
a
peony
number
slowed
down
at
once
and
looked
guiltily
at
his
father
who
was
mowing
the
lawn
the
doctor
had
his
back
to
this
accident
and
he
continued
to
pace
slowly
to
and
fro
pushing
the
mower
jim
dropped
the
tongue
of
the
cart
he
looked
at
his
father
and
at
the
broken
flower
finally
he
went
to
the
peony
and
tried
to
stand
it
on
its
pins
resuscitated
but
the
spine
of
it
was
hurt
and
it
would
only
hang
limply
from
his
hand
jim
could
do
no
reparation
he
looked
again
towards
his
father
he
went
on
to
the
lawn
very
slowly
and
kicking
wretchedly
at
the
turf
presently
his
father
came
along
with
the
whirring
machine
while
the
sweet
new
grass
blades
spun
from
the
knives
in
a
low
voice
jim
said
pa
the
doctor
was
shaving
this
lawn
as
if
it
were
a
priest
chin
all
during
the
season
he
had
worked
at
it
in
the
coolness
and
peace
of
the
evenings
after
supper
even
in
the
shadow
of
the
the
grass
was
strong
and
healthy
jim
raised
his
voice
a
trifle
pa
the
doctor
paused
and
with
the
howl
of
the
machine
no
longer
occupying
the
sense
one
could
hear
the
robins
in
the
arranging
their
affairs
jim
hands
were
behind
his
back
and
sometimes
his
fingers
clasped
and
unclasped
again
he
said
pa
the
child
fresh
and
rosy
lip
was
lowered
the
doctor
stared
down
at
his
son
thrusting
his
head
forward
and
frowning
attentively
what
is
it
jimmie
pa
repeated
the
child
at
length
then
he
raised
his
finger
and
pointed
at
the
flowerbed
there
what
said
the
doctor
frowning
more
what
is
it
jim
after
a
period
of
silence
during
which
the
child
may
have
undergone
a
severe
mental
tumult
he
raised
his
finger
and
repeated
his
former
word
there
the
father
had
respected
this
silence
with
perfect
courtesy
afterwards
his
glance
carefully
followed
the
direction
indicated
by
the
child
finger
but
he
could
see
nothing
which
explained
to
him
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
jimmie
he
said
it
seemed
that
the
importance
of
the
whole
thing
had
taken
away
the
boy
vocabulary
he
could
only
reiterate
there
the
doctor
mused
upon
the
situation
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
at
last
he
said
come
show
me
together
they
crossed
the
lawn
towards
the
at
some
yards
from
the
broken
peony
jimmie
began
to
lag
there
the
word
came
almost
breathlessly
where
said
the
doctor
jimmie
kicked
at
the
grass
there
he
replied
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
go
forward
alone
after
some
trouble
he
found
the
subject
of
the
incident
the
broken
flower
turning
then
he
saw
the
child
lurking
at
the
rear
and
scanning
his
countenance
the
father
reflected
after
a
time
he
said
jimmie
come
here
with
an
infinite
modesty
of
demeanor
the
child
came
forward
jimmie
how
did
this
happen
the
child
answered
now
i
was
playin
train
and
now
i
runned
over
it
you
were
doing
what
i
was
playin
train
the
father
reflected
again
well
jimmie
he
said
slowly
i
guess
you
had
better
not
play
train
any
more
do
you
think
you
had
better
no
sir
said
jimmie
during
the
delivery
of
the
judgment
the
child
had
not
faced
his
father
and
afterwards
he
went
away
with
his
head
lowered
shuffling
his
feet
ii
it
was
apparent
from
jimmie
manner
that
he
felt
some
kind
of
desire
to
efface
himself
he
went
down
to
the
stable
henry
johnson
the
negro
who
cared
for
the
doctor
horses
was
sponging
the
buggy
he
grinned
fraternally
when
he
saw
jimmie
coming
these
two
were
pals
in
regard
to
almost
everything
in
life
they
seemed
to
have
minds
precisely
alike
of
course
there
were
points
of
emphatic
divergence
for
instance
it
was
plain
from
henry
talk
that
he
was
a
very
handsome
negro
and
he
was
known
to
be
a
light
a
weight
and
an
eminence
in
the
suburb
of
the
town
where
lived
the
larger
number
of
the
negroes
and
obviously
this
glory
was
over
jimmie
horizon
but
he
vaguely
appreciated
it
and
paid
deference
to
henry
for
it
mainly
because
henry
appreciated
it
and
deferred
to
himself
however
on
all
points
of
conduct
as
related
to
the
doctor
who
was
the
moon
they
were
in
complete
but
unexpressed
understanding
whenever
jimmie
became
the
victim
of
an
eclipse
he
went
to
the
stable
to
solace
himself
with
henry
crimes
henry
with
the
elasticity
of
his
race
could
usually
provide
a
sin
to
place
himself
on
a
footing
with
the
disgraced
one
perhaps
he
would
remember
that
he
had
forgotten
to
put
the
in
the
back
of
the
buggy
on
some
recent
occasion
and
had
been
reprimanded
by
the
doctor
then
these
two
would
commune
subtly
and
without
words
concerning
their
moon
holding
themselves
sympathetically
as
people
who
had
committed
similar
treasons
on
the
other
hand
henry
would
sometimes
choose
to
absolutely
repudiate
this
idea
and
when
jimmie
appeared
in
his
shame
would
bully
him
most
virtuously
preaching
with
assurance
the
precepts
of
the
creed
and
pointing
out
to
jimmie
all
his
abominations
jimmie
did
not
discover
that
this
was
odious
in
his
comrade
he
accepted
it
and
lived
in
its
shadow
with
humility
merely
trying
to
conciliate
the
saintly
henry
with
acts
of
deference
won
by
this
attitude
henry
would
sometimes
allow
the
child
to
enjoy
the
felicity
of
squeezing
the
sponge
over
a
even
when
jimmie
was
still
gory
from
unspeakable
deeds
whenever
henry
dwelt
for
a
time
in
sackcloth
jimmie
did
not
patronize
him
at
all
this
was
a
justice
of
his
age
his
condition
he
did
not
know
besides
henry
could
drive
a
horse
and
jimmie
had
a
full
sense
of
this
sublimity
henry
personally
conducted
the
moon
during
the
splendid
journeys
through
the
country
roads
where
farms
spread
on
all
sides
with
sheep
cows
and
other
marvels
abounding
hello
jim
said
henry
poising
his
sponge
water
was
dripping
from
the
buggy
sometimes
the
horses
in
the
stalls
stamped
thunderingly
on
the
pine
floor
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
hay
and
of
harness
for
a
minute
jimmie
refused
to
take
an
interest
in
anything
he
was
very
downcast
he
could
not
even
feel
the
wonders
of
wagon
washing
henry
while
at
his
work
narrowly
observed
him
your
pop
done
wallop
yer
did
he
he
said
at
last
no
said
jimmie
defensively
he
did
after
this
casual
remark
henry
continued
his
labor
with
a
scowl
of
occupation
presently
he
said
i
done
tol
yer
many
th
time
not
to
go
an
with
them
flowers
yer
pop
don
like
it
nohow
as
a
matter
of
fact
henry
had
never
mentioned
flowers
to
the
boy
jimmie
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
so
henry
began
to
use
seductive
wiles
in
this
affair
of
washing
a
wagon
it
was
not
until
he
began
to
spin
a
wheel
on
the
tree
and
the
sprinkling
water
flew
everywhere
that
the
boy
was
visibly
moved
he
had
been
seated
on
the
sill
of
the
door
but
at
the
beginning
of
this
ceremony
he
arose
and
circled
towards
the
buggy
with
an
interest
that
slowly
consumed
the
remembrance
of
a
late
disgrace
johnson
could
then
display
all
the
dignity
of
a
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
protect
jimmie
from
a
splashing
look
out
boy
look
out
you
done
gwi

i
ai
he
spoke
with
an
air
of
great
irritation
but
he
was
not
annoyed
at
all
this
tone
was
merely
a
part
of
his
importance
in
reality
he
was
always
delighted
to
have
the
child
there
to
witness
the
business
of
the
stable
for
one
thing
jimmie
was
invariably
overcome
with
reverence
when
he
was
told
how
beautifully
a
harness
was
polished
or
a
horse
groomed
henry
explained
each
detail
of
this
kind
with
unction
procuring
great
joy
from
the
child
admiration
iii
after
johnson
had
taken
his
supper
in
the
kitchen
he
went
to
his
loft
in
the
carriage
house
and
dressed
himself
with
much
care
no
belle
of
a
court
circle
could
bestow
more
mind
on
a
toilet
than
did
johnson
on
second
thought
he
was
more
like
a
priest
arraying
himself
for
some
parade
of
the
church
as
he
emerged
from
his
room
and
sauntered
down
the
no
one
would
have
suspected
him
of
ever
having
washed
a
buggy
illustration
no
one
would
have
suspected
him
of
ever
having
washed
a
buggy
it
was
not
altogether
a
matter
of
the
lavender
trousers
nor
yet
the
straw
hat
with
its
bright
silk
band
the
change
was
somewhere
far
in
the
interior
of
henry
but
there
was
no
hyperbole
in
it
he
was
simply
a
quiet
gentleman
of
position
wealth
and
other
necessary
achievements
out
for
an
evening
stroll
and
he
had
never
washed
a
wagon
in
his
life
in
the
morning
when
in
his
he
had
met
a
friend
hello
pete
hello
henry
now
in
his
effulgence
he
encountered
this
same
friend
his
bow
was
not
at
all
haughty
if
it
expressed
anything
it
expressed
consummate
generosity

and

misteh
johnsing
the
shimmering
blue
of
the
electric
arc
lamps
was
strong
in
the
main
street
of
the
town
at
numerous
points
it
was
conquered
by
the
orange
glare
of
the
outnumbering
gaslights
in
the
windows
of
shops
through
this
radiant
lane
moved
a
crowd
which
culminated
in
a
throng
before
the
awaiting
the
distribution
of
the
evening
mails
occasionally
there
came
into
it
a
shrill
electric
the
motor
singing
like
a
cageful
of
grasshoppers
and
possessing
a
great
gong
that
clanged
forth
both
warnings
and
simple
noise
at
the
little
theatre
which
was
a
varnish
and
red
plush
miniature
of
one
of
the
famous
new
york
theatres
a
company
of
strollers
was
to
play
east
lynne
the
young
men
of
the
town
were
mainly
gathered
at
the
corners
in
distinctive
groups
which
expressed
various
shades
and
lines
of
chumship
and
had
little
to
do
with
any
social
gradations
there
they
discussed
everything
with
critical
insight
passing
the
whole
town
in
review
as
it
swarmed
in
the
street
when
the
gongs
of
the
electric
cars
ceased
for
a
moment
to
harry
the
ears
there
could
be
heard
the
sound
of
the
feet
of
the
leisurely
crowd
on
the
bluestone
pavement
and
it
was
like
the
peaceful
evening
lashing
at
the
shore
of
a
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
two
lines
of
maples
sentinelled
the
way
an
electric
lamp
glowed
high
among
the
embowering
branches
and
made
most
wonderful
on
the
road
below
it
when
johnson
appeared
amid
the
throng
a
member
of
one
of
the
profane
groups
at
a
corner
instantly
telegraphed
news
of
this
extraordinary
arrival
to
his
companions
they
hailed
him
hello
henry
going
to
walk
for
a
cake
ai
he
smooth
why
you
got
that
cake
right
in
your
pocket
henry
throw
out
your
chest
a
little
more
henry
was
not
ruffled
in
any
way
by
these
quiet
admonitions
and
compliments
in
reply
he
laughed
a
supremely
chuckling
laugh
which
nevertheless
expressed
an
underground
complacency
of
superior
metal
young
griscom
the
lawyer
was
just
emerging
from
reifsnyder
barber
shop
rubbing
his
chin
contentedly
on
the
steps
he
dropped
his
hand
and
looked
with
wide
eyes
into
the
crowd
suddenly
he
bolted
back
into
the
shop
wow
he
cried
to
the
parliament
you
ought
to
see
the
coon
that
coming
reifsnyder
and
his
assistant
instantly
poised
their
razors
high
and
turned
towards
the
window
two
belathered
heads
reared
from
the
chairs
the
electric
shine
in
the
street
caused
an
effect
like
water
to
them
who
looked
through
the
glass
from
the
yellow
glamour
of
reifsnyder
shop
in
fact
the
people
without
resembled
the
inhabitants
of
a
great
aquarium
that
here
had
a
square
pane
in
it
presently
into
this
frame
swam
the
graceful
form
of
henry
johnson
chee
said
reifsnyder
he
and
his
assistant
with
one
accord
threw
their
obligations
to
the
winds
and
leaving
their
lathered
victims
helpless
advanced
to
the
window
ai
he
a
taisy
said
reifsnyder
marvelling
but
the
man
in
the
first
chair
with
a
grievance
in
his
mind
had
found
a
weapon
why
that
only
henry
johnson
you
blamed
idiots
come
on
now
reif
and
shave
me
what
do
you
think
i
am
a
mummy
reifsnyder
turned
in
a
great
excitement
i
bait
you
any
money
that
vas
not
henry
johnson
henry
johnson
rats
the
scorn
put
into
this
last
word
made
it
an
explosion
that
man
was
a
porter
or
someding
how
could
that
be
henry
johnson
he
demanded
turbulently
you
vas
crazy
the
man
in
the
first
chair
faced
the
barber
in
a
storm
of
indignation
did
i
give
him
those
lavender
trousers
he
roared
and
young
griscom
who
had
remained
attentively
at
the
window
said
yes
i
guess
that
was
henry
it
looked
like
him
oh
vell
said
reifsnyder
returning
to
his
business
if
you
think
so
oh
vell
he
implied
that
he
was
submitting
for
the
sake
of
amiability
finally
the
man
in
the
second
chair
mumbling
from
a
mouth
made
timid
by
adjacent
lather
said
that
was
henry
johnson
all
right
why
he
always
dresses
like
that
when
he
wants
to
make
a
front
he
the
biggest
dude
in
town
anybody
knows

illustration
johnson
rats
henry
was
not
at
all
oblivious
of
the
wake
of
wondering
ejaculation
that
streamed
out
behind
him
on
other
occasions
he
had
reaped
this
same
joy
and
he
always
had
an
eye
for
the
demonstration
with
a
face
beaming
with
happiness
he
turned
away
from
the
scene
of
his
victories
into
a
narrow
side
street
where
the
electric
light
still
hung
high
but
only
to
exhibit
a
row
of
houses
leaning
together
like
paralytics
the
saffron
miss
bella
farragut
in
a
calico
frock
had
been
crouched
on
the
front
stoop
gossiping
at
long
range
but
she
espied
her
approaching
caller
at
a
distance
she
dashed
around
the
corner
of
the
house
galloping
like
a
horse
henry
saw
it
all
but
he
preserved
the
polite
demeanor
of
a
guest
when
a
waiter
spills
claret
down
his
cuff
in
this
awkward
situation
he
was
simply
perfect
the
duty
of

after

in

in

they
exchanged
the
most
tremendous
civilities
until
miss
bella
swept
into
the
room
when
there
was
more
kowtow
on
all
sides
and
a
smiling
show
of
teeth
that
was
like
an
illumination
the

of
course
in

and
on
the

some
kind
of
a
stew
farragut

to
arise
and
attend

from

also
young
sim
came
in
and
went
to

on
his
pallet
in
the
corner
but
to
all
these
domesticities
the
three
maintained
an
absolute
dumbness
they
bowed
and
smiled
and
ignored
and
imitated
until
a
late
hour
and
if
they
had
been
the
occupants
of
the
most
gorgeous
salon
in
the
world
they
could
not
have
been
more
like
three
monkeys
after
henry
had
gone
bella
who
encouraged
herself
in
the
appropriation
of
phrases
said
oh
ma

divine
illustration
they
bowed
and
smiled
until
a
late
hour
iv
a
saturday
evening
was
a
sign
always
for
a
larger
crowd
to
parade
the
thoroughfare
in
summer
the
band
played
until
ten
in
the
little
park
most
of
the
young
men
of
the
town
affected
to
be
superior
to
this
band
even
to
despise
it
but
in
the
still
and
fragrant
evenings
they
invariably
turned
out
in
force
because
the
girls
were
sure
to
attend
this
concert
strolling
slowly
over
the
grass
linked
closely
in
pairs
or
preferably
in
threes
in
the
curious
public
dependence
upon
one
another
which
was
their
inheritance
there
was
no
particular
social
aspect
to
this
gathering
save
that
group
regarded
group
with
interest
but
mainly
in
silence
perhaps
one
girl
would
nudge
another
girl
and
suddenly
say
look
there
goes
gertie
hodgson
and
her
sister
and
they
would
appear
to
regard
this
as
an
event
of
importance
on
a
particular
evening
a
rather
large
company
of
young
men
were
gathered
on
the
sidewalk
that
edged
the
park
they
remained
thus
beyond
the
borders
of
the
festivities
because
of
their
dignity
which
would
not
exactly
allow
them
to
appear
in
anything
which
was
so
much
fun
for
the
younger
lads
these
latter
were
careering
madly
through
the
crowd
precipitating
minor
accidents
from
time
to
time
but
usually
fleeing
like
mist
swept
by
the
wind
before
retribution
could
lay
hands
upon
them
the
band
played
a
waltz
which
involved
a
gift
of
prominence
to
the
bass
horn
and
one
of
the
young
men
on
the
sidewalk
said
that
the
music
reminded
him
of
the
new
engines
on
the
hill
pumping
water
into
the
reservoir
a
similarity
of
this
kind
was
not
inconceivable
but
the
young
man
did
not
say
it
because
he
disliked
the
band
playing
he
said
it
because
it
was
fashionable
to
say
that
manner
of
thing
concerning
the
band
however
over
in
the
stand
billie
harris
who
played
the
was
always
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
boys
who
adored
his
every
whack
after
the
mails
from
new
york
and
rochester
had
been
finally
distributed
the
crowd
from
the
added
to
the
mass
already
in
the
park
the
wind
waved
the
leaves
of
the
maples
and
high
in
the
air
the
globes
of
the
arc
lamps
caused
the
wonderful
traceries
of
leaf
shadows
on
the
ground
when
the
light
fell
upon
the
upturned
face
of
a
girl
it
caused
it
to
glow
with
a
wonderful
pallor
a
policeman
came
suddenly
from
the
darkness
and
chased
a
gang
of
obstreperous
little
boys
they
hooted
him
from
a
distance
the
leader
of
the
band
had
some
of
the
mannerisms
of
the
great
musicians
and
during
a
period
of
silence
the
crowd
smiled
when
they
saw
him
raise
his
hand
to
his
brow
stroke
it
sentimentally
and
glance
upward
with
a
look
of
poetic
anguish
in
the
shivering
light
which
gave
to
the
park
an
effect
like
a
great
vaulted
hall
the
throng
swarmed
with
a
gentle
murmur
of
dresses
switching
the
turf
and
with
a
steady
hum
of
voices

the
band
played
a
waltz
suddenly
without
preliminary
bars
there
arose
from
afar
the
great
hoarse
roar
of
a
factory
whistle
it
raised
and
swelled
to
a
sinister
note
and
then
it
sang
on
the
night
wind
one
long
call
that
held
the
crowd
in
the
park
immovable
speechless
the
had
been
about
to
vehemently
let
fall
his
hand
to
start
the
band
on
a
thundering
career
through
a
popular
march
but
smitten
by
this
giant
voice
from
the
night
his
hand
dropped
slowly
to
his
knee
and
his
mouth
agape
he
looked
at
his
men
in
silence
the
cry
died
away
to
a
wail
and
then
to
stillness
it
released
the
muscles
of
the
company
of
young
men
on
the
sidewalk
who
had
been
like
statues
posed
eagerly
lithely
their
ears
turned
and
then
they
wheeled
upon
each
other
simultaneously
and
in
a
single
explosion
they
shouted
one
again
the
sound
swelled
in
the
night
and
roared
its
long
ominous
cry
and
as
it
died
away
the
crowd
of
young
men
wheeled
upon
each
other
and
in
chorus
yelled
two
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
waiting

they
bawled

a
flash
the
company

indolent

joined

dark
figures
sped
towards

on

had

pulled
madly
in

heard

exercising
a
singular
muscular
ability
rolled
out
in

from

arose
dishevelled
and
aggrieved
casting
a
look
of
mournful
disenchantment
upon
the
black
crowd
that
poured
after

machine
the

seemed
to
be
the
apex

a
dark
wave

was
whirling

broken
dam
back
of

lad
were
stretches
of
lawn
and
in

direction
were
banged
by
men

hoarsely
shouted
out
into
the
clamorous
avenue
what
district
at
one
of
these
houses
a
woman
came
to
the
door
bearing
a
lamp
shielding
her
face
from
its
rays
with
her
hands
across
the
cropped
grass
the
avenue
represented
to
her
a
kind
of
black
torrent
upon
which
nevertheless
fled
numerous
miraculous
figures
upon
bicycles
she
did
not
know
that
the
towering
light
at
the
corner
was
continuing
its
nightly
whine
suddenly
a
little
boy
somersaulted
around
the
corner
of
the
house
as
if
he
had
been
projected
down
a
flight
of
stairs
by
a
catapultian
boot
he
halted
himself
in
front
of
the
house
by
dint
of
a
rather
extraordinary
evolution
with
his
legs

gasped

just

just
down

from

avenue
came
the
sound
of
rushing
men

wildly
shouted
somebody
had
grappled
the
in
the
methodist
church
and
now
over
the
town
rang
this
solemn
and
terrible
voice
speaking
from
the
clouds
moved
from
its
peaceful
business
this
bell
gained
a
new
spirit
in
the
portentous
night

it
swung

the
outlines
of
the
house
of
trescott
had
faded
quietly
into
the
evening
hiding
a
shape
such
as
we
call
queen
anne
against
the
pall
of
the
blackened
sky
the
neighborhood
was
at
this
time
so
quiet
and
seemed
so
devoid
of
obstructions
that
hannigan
dog
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
prowl
in
forbidden
precincts
and
so
came
and
pawed

growling
and
considering
himself
a
formidable
beast

peter
washington
strolled
past
the
house
and
whistled
but
there
was
no
dim
light
shining
from
henry
loft
and
presently
peter
went
his
way
the
rays
from
the
street
creeping
in
silvery
waves
over
the
grass
caused
the
row
of
shrubs
along
the
drive
to
throw
a
clear
bold
shade
a
wisp
of
smoke
came
from
one
of
the
windows
at
the
end
of
the
house
and
drifted
quietly
into
the
branches
of
a
its
companions
followed
it
in
slowly
increasing
numbers
and
finally
there
was
a
current
controlled
by
invisible
banks
which
poured
into
the
boughs
of
the
it
was
no
more
to
be
noted
than
if
a
troop
of
dim
and
silent
gray
monkeys
had
been
climbing
a
grapevine
into
the
clouds
after
a
moment
the
window
brightened
as
if
the
four
panes
of
it
had
been
stained
with
blood
and
a
quick
ear
might
have
been
led
to
imagine
the
calling
and
calling
clan
joining
clan
gathering
to
the
colors
from
the
street
however
the
house
maintained
its
dark
quiet
insisting
to
a
that
it
was
the
safe
dwelling
of
people
who
chose
to
retire
early
to
tranquil
dreams
no
one
could
have
heard
this
low
droning
of
the
gathering
clans
suddenly
the
panes
of
the
red
window
tinkled
and
crashed
to
the
ground
and
at
other
windows
there
suddenly
reared
other
flames
like
bloody
spectres
at
the
apertures
of
a
haunted
house
this
outbreak
had
been
well
planned
as
if
by
professional
revolutionists
a
man
voice
suddenly
shouted
fire
fire
fire
hannigan
had
flung
his
pipe
frenziedly
from
him
because
his
lungs
demanded
room
he
tumbled
down
from
his
perch
swung
over
the
fence
and
ran
shouting
towards
the
of
the
trescotts
then
he
hammered
on
the
door
using
his
fists
as
if
they
were
mallets
trescott
instantly
came
to
one
of
the
windows
on
the
second
floor
afterwards
she
knew
she
had
been
about
to
say
the
doctor
is
not
at
home
but
if
you
will
leave
your
name
i
will
let
him
know
as
soon
as
he
comes
hannigan
bawling
was
for
a
minute
incoherent
but
she
understood
that
it
was
not
about
croup
what
she
said
raising
the
window
swiftly
your
house
is
on
fire
you
all
ablaze
move
quick
if
his
cries
were
resounding
in
the
street
as
if
it
were
a
cave
of
echoes
many
feet
pattered
swiftly
on
the
stones
there
was
one
man
who
ran
with
an
almost
fabulous
speed
he
wore
lavender
trousers
a
straw
hat
with
a
bright
silk
band
was
held
half
crumpled
in
his
hand
as
henry
reached
the
hannigan
had
just
broken
the
lock
with
a
kick
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
poured
over
them
and
henry
ducking
his
head
rushed
into
it
from
hannigan
clamor
he
knew
only
one
thing
but
it
turned
him
blue
with
horror
in
the
hall
a
lick
of
flame
had
found
the
cord
that
supported
signing
the
declaration
the
engraving
slumped
suddenly
down
at
one
end
and
then
dropped
to
the
floor
where
it
burst
with
the
sound
of
a
bomb
the
fire
was
already
roaring
like
a
winter
wind
among
the
pines
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
trescott
was
waving
her
arms
as
if
they
were
two
reeds
jimmie
save
jimmie
she
screamed
in
henry
face
he
plunged
past
her
and
disappeared
taking
the
routes
among
these
upper
chambers
where
he
had
once
held
office
as
a
sort
of
second
assistant
hannigan
had
followed
him
up
the
stairs
and
grappled
the
arm
of
the
maniacal
woman
there
his
face
was
black
with
rage
you
must
come
down
he
bellowed
she
would
only
scream
at
him
in
reply
jimmie
jimmie
save
jimmie
but
he
dragged
her
forth
while
she
babbled
at
him
as
they
swung
out
into
the
open
air
a
man
ran
across
the
lawn
and
seizing
a
shutter
pulled
it
from
its
hinges
and
flung
it
far
out
upon
the
grass
then
he
frantically
attacked
the
other
shutters
one
by
one
it
was
a
kind
of
temporary
insanity
here
you
howled
hannigan
hold
trescott
and
stop
the
news
had
been
telegraphed
by
a
twist
of
the
wrist
of
a
neighbor
who
had
gone
to
the
at
the
corner
and
the
time
when
hannigan
and
his
charge
struggled
out
of
the
house
was
the
time
when
the
whistle
roared
its
hoarse
night
call
smiting
the
crowd
in
the
park
causing
the
leader
of
the
band
who
was
about
to
order
the
first
triumphal
clang
of
a
military
march
to
let
his
hand
drop
slowly
to
his
knees
vii
henry
pawed
awkwardly
through
the
smoke
in
the
upper
halls
he
had
attempted
to
guide
himself
by
the
walls
but
they
were
too
hot
the
paper
was
crimpling
and
he
expected
at
any
moment
to
have
a
flame
burst
from
under
his
hands
jimmie
he
did
not
call
very
loud
as
if
in
fear
that
the
humming
flames
below
would
overhear
him
jimmie
oh
jimmie
stumbling
and
panting
he
speedily
reached
the
entrance
to
room
and
flung
open
the
door
the
little
chamber
had
no
smoke
in
it
at
all
it
was
faintly
illuminated
by
a
beautiful
rosy
light
reflected
circuitously
from
the
flames
that
were
consuming
the
house
the
boy
had
apparently
just
been
aroused
by
the
noise
he
sat
in
his
bed
his
lips
apart
his
eyes
wide
while
upon
his
little
figure
played
caressingly
the
light
from
the
fire
as
the
door
flew
open
he
had
before
him
this
apparition
of
his
pal
a
negro
all
tousled
and
with
wool
scorching
who
leaped
upon
him
and
bore
him
up
in
a
blanket
as
if
the
whole
affair
were
a
case
of
kidnapping
by
a
dreadful
robber
chief
without
waiting
to
go
through
the
usual
short
but
complete
process
of
wrinkling
up
his
face
jimmie
let
out
a
gorgeous
bawl
which
resembled
the
expression
of
a
calf
deepest
terror
as
johnson
bearing
him
reeled
into
the
smoke
of
the
hall
he
flung
his
arms
about
his
neck
and
buried
his
face
in
the
blanket
he
called
twice
in
muffled
tones
when
johnson
came
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
his
burden
he
took
a
quick
step
backward
through
the
smoke
that
rolled
to
him
he
could
see
that
the
lower
hall
was
all
ablaze
he
cried
out
then
in
a
howl
that
resembled
former
achievement
his
legs
gained
a
frightful
faculty
of
bending
sideways
swinging
about
precariously
on
these
reedy
legs
he
made
his
way
back
slowly
back
along
the
upper
hall
from
the
way
of
him
then
he
had
given
up
almost
all
idea
of
escaping
from
the
burning
house
and
with
it
the
desire
he
was
submitting
submitting
because
of
his
fathers
bending
his
mind
in
a
most
perfect
slavery
to
this
conflagration
he
now
clutched
jimmie
as
unconsciously
as
when
running
toward
the
house
he
had
clutched
the
hat
with
the
bright
silk
band
suddenly
he
remembered
a
little
private
staircase
which
led
from
a
bedroom
to
an
apartment
which
the
doctor
had
fitted
up
as
a
laboratory
and
where
he
used
some
of
his
leisure
and
also
hours
when
he
might
have
been
sleeping
in
devoting
himself
to
experiments
which
came
in
the
way
of
his
study
and
interest
when
johnson
recalled
this
stairway
the
submission
to
the
blaze
departed
instantly
he
had
been
perfectly
familiar
with
it
but
his
confusion
had
destroyed
the
memory
of
it
in
his
sudden
momentary
apathy
there
had
been
little
that
resembled
fear
but
now
as
a
way
of
safety
came
to
him
the
old
frantic
terror
caught
him
he
was
no
longer
creature
to
the
flames
and
he
was
afraid
of
the
battle
with
them
it
was
a
singular
and
swift
set
of
alternations
in
which
he
feared
twice
without
submission
and
submitted
once
without
fear
jimmie
he
wailed
as
he
staggered
on
his
way
he
wished
this
little
inanimate
body
at
his
breast
to
participate
in
his
tremblings
but
the
child
had
lain
limp
and
still
during
these
headlong
charges
and
countercharges
and
no
sign
came
from
him
johnson
passed
through
two
rooms
and
came
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
he
opened
the
door
great
billows
of
smoke
poured
out
but
gripping
jimmie
closer
he
plunged
down
through
them
all
manner
of
odors
assailed
him
during
this
flight
they
seemed
to
be
alive
with
envy
hatred
and
malice
at
the
entrance
to
the
laboratory
he
confronted
a
strange
spectacle
the
room
was
like
a
garden
in
the
region
where
might
be
burning
flowers
flames
of
violet
crimson
green
blue
orange
and
purple
were
blooming
everywhere
there
was
one
blaze
that
was
precisely
the
hue
of
a
delicate
coral
in
another
place
was
a
mass
that
lay
merely
in
phosphorescent
inaction
like
a
pile
of
emeralds
but
all
these
marvels
were
to
be
seen
dimly
through
clouds
of
heaving
turning
deadly
smoke
johnson
halted
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
he
cried
out
again
in
the
negro
wail
that
had
in
it
the
sadness
of
the
swamps
then
he
rushed
across
the
room
an
flame
leaped
like
a
panther
at
the
lavender
trousers
this
animal
bit
deeply
into
johnson
there
was
an
explosion
at
one
side
and
suddenly
before
him
there
reared
a
delicate
trembling
sapphire
shape
like
a
fairy
lady
with
a
quiet
smile
she
blocked
his
path
and
doomed
him
and
jimmie
johnson
shrieked
and
then
ducked
in
the
manner
of
his
race
in
fights
he
aimed
to
pass
under
the
left
guard
of
the
sapphire
lady
but
she
was
swifter
than
eagles
and
her
talons
caught
in
him
as
he
plunged
past
her
bowing
his
head
as
if
his
neck
had
been
struck
johnson
lurched
forward
twisting
this
way
and
that
way
he
fell
on
his
back
the
still
form
in
the
blanket
flung
from
his
arms
rolled
to
the
edge
of
the
floor
and
beneath
the
window
johnson
had
fallen
with
his
head
at
the
base
of
an
desk
there
was
a
row
of
jars
upon
the
top
of
this
desk
for
the
most
part
they
were
silent
amid
this
rioting
but
there
was
one
which
seemed
to
hold
a
scintillant
and
writhing
serpent
suddenly
the
glass
splintered
and
a
snakelike
thing
poured
its
thick
length
out
upon
the
top
of
the
old
desk
it
coiled
and
hesitated
and
then
began
to
swim
a
languorous
way
down
the
mahogany
slant
at
the
angle
it
waved
its
sizzling
molten
head
to
and
fro
over
the
closed
eyes
of
the
man
beneath
it
then
in
a
moment
with
a
mystic
impulse
it
moved
again
and
the
red
snake
flowed
directly
down
into
johnson
upturned
face
afterwards
the
trail
of
this
creature
seemed
to
reek
and
amid
flames
and
low
explosions
drops
like
jewels
pattered
softly
down
it
at
leisurely
intervals
illustration

viii
suddenly
all
roads
led
to
trescott
the
whole
town
flowed
towards
one
point
chippeway
hose
company
number
one
toiled
desperately
up
bridge
street
hill
even
as
the
tuscaroras
came
in
an
impetuous
sweep
down
niagara
avenue
meanwhile
the
machine
of
the
experts
from
across
the
creek
was
spinning
on
its
way
the
chief
of
the
fire
department
had
been
playing
poker
in
the
rear
room
of
whiteley
but
at
the
first
breath
of
the
alarm
he
sprang
through
the
door
like
a
man
escaping
with
the
kitty
in
whilomville
on
these
occasions
there
was
always
a
number
of
people
who
instantly
turned
their
attention
to
the
bells
in
the
churches
and
the
bells
not
only
emphasized
the
alarm
but
it
was
the
habit
to
send
these
sounds
rolling
across
the
sky
in
a
stirring
brazen
uproar
until
the
flames
were
practically
vanquished
there
was
also
a
kind
of
rivalry
as
to
which
bell
should
be
made
to
produce
the
greatest
din
even
the
valley
church
four
miles
away
among
the
farms
had
heard
the
voices
of
its
brethren
and
immediately
added
a
quaint
little
yelp
trescott
had
been
driving
homeward
slowly
smoking
a
cigar
and
feeling
glad
that
this
last
case
was
now
in
complete
obedience
to
him
like
a
wild
animal
that
he
had
subdued
when
he
heard
the
long
whistle
and
chirped
to
his
horse
under
the
unlicensed
but
perfectly
distinct
impression
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
in
oakhurst
a
new
and
rather
suburb
of
the
town
which
was
at
least
two
miles
from
his
own
home
but
in
the
second
blast
and
in
the
ensuing
silence
he
read
the
designation
of
his
own
district
he
was
then
only
a
few
blocks
from
his
house
he
took
out
the
whip
and
laid
it
lightly
on
the
mare
surprised
and
frightened
at
this
extraordinary
action
she
leaped
forward
and
as
the
reins
straightened
like
steel
bands
the
doctor
leaned
backward
a
trifle
when
the
mare
whirled
him
up
to
the
closed
gate
he
was
wondering
whose
house
could
be
afire
the
man
who
had
rung
the
yelled
something
at
him
but
he
already
knew
he
left
the
mare
to
her
will
in
front
of
his
door
was
a
maniacal
woman
in
a
wrapper
ned
she
screamed
at
sight
of
him
jimmie
save
jimmie
trescott
had
grown
hard
and
chill
where
he
said
where
trescott
voice
began
to
bubble
up
up
up
she
pointed
at
the
windows
hannigan
was
already
shouting
do
go
in
that
way
you
ca
go
in
that
way
trescott
ran
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
disappeared
from
them
he
knew
from
the
view
he
had
taken
of
the
main
hall
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
ascend
from
there
his
hopes
were
fastened
now
to
the
stairway
which
led
from
the
laboratory
the
door
which
opened
from
this
room
out
upon
the
lawn
was
fastened
with
a
bolt
and
lock
but
he
kicked
close
to
the
lock
and
then
close
to
the
bolt
the
door
with
a
loud
crash
flew
back
the
doctor
recoiled
from
the
roll
of
smoke
and
then
bending
low
he
stepped
into
the
garden
of
burning
flowers
on
the
floor
his
stinging
eyes
could
make
out
a
form
in
a
smouldering
blanket
near
the
window
then
as
he
carried
his
son
towards
the
door
he
saw
that
the
whole
lawn
seemed
now
alive
with
men
and
boys
the
leaders
in
the
great
charge
that
the
whole
town
was
making
they
seized
him
and
his
burden
and
overpowered
him
in
wet
blankets
and
water
but
hannigan
was
howling
johnson
is
in
there
yet
henry
johnson
is
in
there
yet
he
went
in
after
the
kid
johnson
is
in
there
yet
these
cries
penetrated
to
the
sleepy
senses
of
trescott
and
he
struggled
with
his
captors
swearing
unknown
to
him
and
to
them
all
the
deep
blasphemies
of
his
days
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
went
again
towards
the
door
of
the
laboratory
they
endeavored
to
restrain
him
although
they
were
much
affrighted
at
him
but
a
young
man
who
was
a
brakeman
on
the
railway
and
lived
in
one
of
the
rear
streets
near
the
trescotts
had
gone
into
the
laboratory
and
brought
forth
a
thing
which
he
laid
on
the
grass
ix
there
were
hoarse
commands
from
in
front
of
the
house
turn
on
your
water
five
let
go
one
the
gathering
crowd
swayed
this
way
and
that
way
the
flames
towering
high
cast
a
wild
red
light
on
their
faces
there
came
the
clangor
of
a
gong
from
along
some
adjacent
street
the
crowd
exclaimed
at
it
here
comes
number
three
three
a
panting
and
irregular
mob
dashed
into
view
dragging
a
a
cry
of
exultation
arose
from
the
little
boys
here
three
the
lads
welcomed
hose
company
number
three
as
if
it
was
composed
of
a
chariot
dragged
by
a
band
of
gods
the
perspiring
citizens
flung
themselves
into
the
fray
the
boys
danced
in
impish
joy
at
the
displays
of
prowess
they
acclaimed
the
approach
of
number
two
they
welcomed
number
four
with
cheers
they
were
so
deeply
moved
by
this
whole
affair
that
they
bitterly
guyed
the
late
appearance
of
the
hook
and
ladder
company
whose
heavy
apparatus
had
almost
stalled
them
on
the
bridge
street
hill
the
lads
hated
and
feared
a
fire
of
course
they
did
not
particularly
want
to
have
anybody
house
burn
but
still
it
was
fine
to
see
the
gathering
of
the
companies
and
amid
a
great
noise
to
watch
their
heroes
perform
all
manner
of
prodigies
they
were
divided
into
parties
over
the
worth
of
different
companies
and
supported
their
creeds
with
no
small
violence
for
instance
in
that
part
of
the
little
city
where
number
four
had
its
home
it
would
be
most
daring
for
a
boy
to
contend
the
superiority
of
any
other
company
likewise
in
another
quarter
where
a
strange
boy
was
asked
which
fire
company
was
the
best
in
whilomville
he
was
expected
to
answer
number
one
feuds
which
the
boys
forgot
and
remembered
according
to
chance
or
the
importance
of
some
recent
event
existed
all
through
the
town
they
did
not
care
much
for
john
shipley
the
chief
of
the
department
it
was
true
that
he
went
to
a
fire
with
the
speed
of
a
falling
angel
but
when
there
he
invariably
lapsed
into
a
certain
still
mood
which
was
almost
a
preoccupation
moving
leisurely
around
the
burning
structure
and
surveying
it
putting
meanwhile
at
a
cigar
this
quiet
man
who
even
when
life
was
in
danger
seldom
raised
his
voice
was
not
much
to
their
fancy
now
old
sykes
huntington
when
he
was
chief
used
to
bellow
continually
like
a
bull
and
gesticulate
in
a
sort
of
delirium
he
was
much
finer
as
a
spectacle
than
this
shipley
who
viewed
a
fire
with
the
same
steadiness
that
he
viewed
a
raise
in
a
large
the
greater
number
of
the
boys
could
never
understand
why
the
members
of
these
companies
persisted
in
shipley
although
they
often
pretended
to
understand
it
because
my
father
says
was
a
very
formidable
phrase
in
argument
and
the
fathers
seemed
almost
unanimous
in
advocating
shipley
at
this
time
there
was
considerable
discussion
as
to
which
company
had
gotten
the
first
stream
of
water
on
the
fire
most
of
the
boys
claimed
that
number
five
owned
that
distinction
but
there
was
a
determined
minority
who
contended
for
number
one
boys
who
were
the
blood
adherents
of
other
companies
were
obliged
to
choose
between
the
two
on
this
occasion
and
the
talk
waxed
warm
but
a
great
rumor
went
among
the
crowds
it
was
told
with
hushed
voices
afterwards
a
reverent
silence
fell
even
upon
the
boys
jimmie
trescott
and
henry
johnson
had
been
burned
to
death
and
trescott
himself
had
been
most
savagely
hurt
the
crowd
did
not
even
feel
the
police
pushing
at
them
they
raised
their
eyes
shining
now
with
awe
towards
the
high
flames
the
man
who
had
information
was
at
his
best
in
low
tones
he
described
the
whole
affair
that
was
the
kid
room
in
the
corner
there
he
had
measles
or
somethin
and
this
coon
johnson
was
up
with
and
johnson
got
sleepy
or
somethin
and
upset
the
lamp
and
the
doctor
he
was
down
in
his
office
and
he
came
running
up
and
they
all
got
burned
together
till
they
dragged
out
another
man
always
preserved
for
the
deliverance
of
the
final
judgment
was
saying
oh
they
die
sure
burned
to
flinders
no
chance
hull
lot
of
anybody
can
see
the
crowd
concentrated
its
gaze
still
more
closely
upon
these
flags
of
fire
which
waved
joyfully
against
the
black
sky
the
bells
of
the
town
were
clashing
unceasingly
a
little
procession
moved
across
the
lawn
and
towards
the
street
there
were
three
cots
borne
by
twelve
of
the
firemen
the
police
moved
sternly
but
it
needed
no
effort
of
theirs
to
open
a
lane
for
this
slow
cortege
the
men
who
bore
the
cots
were
well
known
to
the
crowd
but
in
this
solemn
parade
during
the
ringing
of
the
bells
and
the
shouting
and
with
the
red
glare
upon
the
sky
they
seemed
utterly
foreign
and
whilomville
paid
them
a
deep
respect
each
man
in
this
stretcher
party
had
gained
a
reflected
majesty
they
were
footmen
to
death
and
the
crowd
made
subtle
obeisance
to
this
august
dignity
derived
from
three
prospective
graves
one
woman
turned
away
with
a
shriek
at
sight
of
the
covered
body
on
the
first
stretcher
and
people
faced
her
suddenly
in
silent
and
mournful
indignation
otherwise
there
was
barely
a
sound
as
these
twelve
important
men
with
measured
tread
carried
their
burdens
through
the
throng
the
little
boys
no
longer
discussed
the
merits
of
the
different
fire
companies
for
the
greater
part
they
had
been
routed
only
the
more
courageous
viewed
closely
the
three
figures
veiled
in
yellow
blankets
x
old
judge
denning
hagenthorpe
who
lived
nearly
opposite
the
trescotts
had
thrown
his
door
wide
open
to
receive
the
afflicted
family
when
it
was
publicly
learned
that
the
doctor
and
his
son
and
the
negro
were
still
alive
it
required
a
specially
detailed
policeman
to
prevent
people
from
scaling
the
front
porch
and
interviewing
these
sorely
wounded
one
old
lady
appeared
with
a
miraculous
poultice
and
she
quoted
most
damning
scripture
to
the
officer
when
he
said
that
she
could
not
pass
him
throughout
the
night
some
lads
old
enough
to
be
given
privileges
or
to
compel
them
from
their
mothers
remained
vigilantly
upon
the
kerb
in
anticipation
of
a
death
or
some
such
event
the
reporter
of
the
morning
tribune
rode
thither
on
his
bicycle
every
hour
until
three
six
of
the
ten
doctors
in
whilomville
attended
at
judge
house
almost
at
once
they
were
able
to
know
that
trescott
burns
were
not
vitally
important
the
child
would
possibly
be
scarred
badly
but
his
life
was
undoubtedly
safe
as
for
the
negro
henry
johnson
he
could
not
live
his
body
was
frightfully
seared
but
more
than
that
he
now
had
no
face
his
face
had
simply
been
burned
away
trescott
was
always
asking
news
of
the
two
other
patients
in
the
morning
he
seemed
fresh
and
strong
so
they
told
him
that
johnson
was
doomed
they
then
saw
him
stir
on
the
bed
and
sprang
quickly
to
see
if
the
bandages
needed
readjusting
in
the
sudden
glance
he
threw
from
one
to
another
he
impressed
them
as
being
both
leonine
and
impracticable
the
morning
paper
announced
the
death
of
henry
johnson
it
contained
a
long
interview
with
edward
hannigan
in
which
the
latter
described
in
full
the
performance
of
johnson
at
the
fire
there
was
also
an
editorial
built
from
all
the
best
words
in
the
vocabulary
of
the
staff
the
town
halted
in
its
accustomed
road
of
thought
and
turned
a
reverent
attention
to
the
memory
of
this
hostler
in
the
breasts
of
many
people
was
the
regret
that
they
had
not
known
enough
to
give
him
a
hand
and
a
lift
when
he
was
alive
and
they
judged
themselves
stupid
and
ungenerous
for
this
failure
the
name
of
henry
johnson
became
suddenly
the
title
of
a
saint
to
the
little
boys
the
one
who
thought
of
it
first
could
by
quoting
it
in
an
argument
at
once
overthrow
his
antagonist
whether
it
applied
to
the
subject
or
whether
it
did
not
nigger
nigger
never
die
black
face
and
shiny
eye
boys
who
had
called
this
odious
couplet
in
the
rear
of
johnson
march
buried
the
fact
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
later
in
the
day
miss
bella
farragut
of
no
watermelon
alley
announced
that
she
had
been
engaged
to
marry
henry
johnson
xi
the
old
judge
had
a
cane
with
an
ivory
head
he
could
never
think
at
his
best
until
he
was
leaning
slightly
on
this
stick
and
smoothing
the
white
top
with
slow
movements
of
his
hands
it
was
also
to
him
a
kind
of
narcotic
if
by
any
chance
he
mislaid
it
he
grew
at
once
very
irritable
and
was
likely
to
speak
sharply
to
his
sister
whose
mental
incapacity
he
had
patiently
endured
for
thirty
years
in
the
old
mansion
on
ontario
street
she
was
not
at
all
aware
of
her
opinion
of
her
endowments
and
so
it
might
be
said
that
the
judge
had
successfully
dissembled
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
only
risking
the
truth
at
the
times
when
his
cane
was
lost
on
a
particular
day
the
judge
sat
in
his
armchair
on
the
porch
the
sunshine
sprinkled
through
the
and
poured
great
coins
on
the
boards
the
sparrows
disputed
in
the
trees
that
lined
the
pavements
the
judge
mused
deeply
while
his
hands
gently
caressed
the
ivory
head
of
his
cane
finally
he
arose
and
entered
the
house
his
brow
still
furrowed
in
a
thoughtful
frown
his
stick
thumped
solemnly
in
regular
beats
on
the
second
floor
he
entered
a
room
where
trescott
was
working
about
the
bedside
of
henry
johnson
the
bandages
on
the
negro
head
allowed
only
one
thing
to
appear
an
eye
which
unwinkingly
stared
at
the
judge
the
later
spoke
to
trescott
on
the
condition
of
the
patient
afterward
he
evidently
had
something
further
to
say
but
he
seemed
to
be
kept
from
it
by
the
scrutiny
of
the
unwinking
eye
at
which
he
furtively
glanced
from
time
to
time
when
jimmie
trescott
was
sufficiently
recovered
his
mother
had
taken
him
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
grandparents
in
connecticut
the
doctor
had
remained
to
take
care
of
his
patients
but
as
a
matter
of
truth
he
spent
most
of
his
time
at
judge
hagenthorpe
house
where
lay
henry
johnson
here
he
slept
and
ate
almost
every
meal
in
the
long
nights
and
days
of
his
vigil
at
dinner
and
away
from
the
magic
of
the
unwinking
eye
the
judge
said
suddenly
trescott
do
you
think
it
is
as
trescott
paused
expectantly
the
judge
fingered
his
knife
he
said
thoughtfully
no
one
wants
to
advance
such
ideas
but
somehow
i
think
that
that
poor
fellow
ought
to
die
there
was
in
trescott
face
at
once
a
look
of
recognition
as
if
in
this
tangent
of
the
judge
he
saw
an
old
problem
he
merely
sighed
and
answered
who
knows
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
deep
tone
that
gave
them
an
elusive
kind
of
significance
the
judge
retreated
to
the
cold
manner
of
the
bench
perhaps
we
may
not
talk
with
propriety
of
this
kind
of
action
but
i
am
induced
to
say
that
you
are
performing
a
questionable
charity
in
preserving
this
negro
life
as
near
as
i
can
understand
he
will
hereafter
be
a
monster
a
perfect
monster
and
probably
with
an
affected
brain
no
man
can
observe
you
as
i
have
observed
you
and
not
know
that
it
was
a
matter
of
conscience
with
you
but
i
am
afraid
my
friend
that
it
is
one
of
the
blunders
of
virtue
the
judge
had
delivered
his
views
with
his
habitual
oratory
the
last
three
words
he
spoke
with
a
particular
emphasis
as
if
the
phrase
was
his
discovery
the
doctor
made
a
weary
gesture
he
saved
my
boy
life
yes
said
the
judge
swiftly
yes
i
know
and
what
am
i
to
do
said
trescott
his
eyes
suddenly
lighting
like
an
outburst
from
smouldering
peat
what
am
i
to
do
he
gave
himself
for
for
jimmie
what
am
i
to
do
for
him
the
judge
abased
himself
completely
before
these
words
he
lowered
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
picked
at
his
cucumbers
presently
he
braced
himself
straightly
in
his
chair
he
will
be
your
creation
you
understand
he
is
purely
your
creation
nature
has
very
evidently
given
him
up
he
is
dead
you
are
restoring
him
to
life
you
are
making
him
and
he
will
be
a
monster
and
with
no
mind
he
will
be
what
you
like
judge
cried
trescott
in
sudden
polite
fury
he
will
be
anything
but
by
god
he
saved
my
boy
the
judge
interrupted
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
trescott
trescott
do
i
know
trescott
had
subsided
to
a
sullen
mood
yes
you
know
he
answered
acidly
but
you
do
know
all
about
your
own
boy
being
saved
from
death
this
was
a
perfectly
childish
allusion
to
the
bachelorhood
trescott
knew
that
the
remark
was
infantile
but
he
seemed
to
take
desperate
delight
in
it
but
it
passed
the
judge
completely
it
was
not
his
spot
i
am
puzzled
said
he
in
profound
thought
i
do
know
what
to
say
trescott
had
become
repentant
do
think
i
do
appreciate
what
you
say
judge
but
of
course
responded
the
judge
quickly
of
course
it
began
trescott
of
course
said
the
judge
in
silence
they
resumed
their
dinner
well
said
the
judge
ultimately
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
know
what
to
do
it
is
said
the
doctor
fervidly
there
was
another
silence
it
was
broken
by
the
judge
look
here
trescott
i
do
want
you
to
think
no
certainly
not
answered
the
doctor
earnestly
well
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
would
say
anything
to
it
was
only
that
i
thought
that
i
might
be
able
to
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
the
affair
was
a
little
dubious
with
an
appearance
of
suddenly
disclosing
his
real
mental
perturbation
the
doctor
said
well
what
would
you
do
would
you
kill
him
he
asked
abruptly
and
sternly
trescott
you
fool
said
the
old
man
gently
oh
well
i
know
judge
but
then
he
turned
red
and
spoke
with
new
violence
say
he
saved
my
boy
do
you
see
he
saved
my
boy
you
bet
he
did
cried
the
judge
with
enthusiasm
you
bet
he
did
and
they
remained
for
a
time
gazing
at
each
other
their
faces
illuminated
with
memories
of
a
certain
deed
after
another
silence
the
judge
said
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
know
what
to
do
xii
late
one
evening
trescott
returning
from
a
professional
call
paused
his
buggy
at
the
hagenthorpe
gate
he
tied
the
mare
to
the
old
post
and
entered
the
house
ultimately
he
appeared
with
a
companion
a
man
who
walked
slowly
and
carefully
as
if
he
were
learning
he
was
wrapped
to
the
heels
in
an
ulster
they
entered
the
buggy
and
drove
away
after
a
silence
only
broken
by
the
swift
and
musical
humming
of
the
wheels
on
the
smooth
road
trescott
spoke
henry
he
said
i
got
you
a
home
here
with
old
alek
williams
you
will
have
everything
you
want
to
eat
and
a
good
place
to
sleep
and
i
hope
you
will
get
along
there
all
right
i
will
pay
all
your
expenses
and
come
to
see
you
as
often
as
i
can
if
you
do
get
along
i
want
you
to
let
me
know
as
soon
as
possible
and
then
we
will
do
what
we
can
to
make
it
better
the
dark
figure
at
the
doctor
side
answered
with
a
cheerful
laugh
these
buggy
wheels
don
look
like
i
washed
yesterday
docteh
he
said
trescott
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
insistently
i
am
taking
you
to
alek
williams
henry
and
i
the
figure
chuckled
again
no
no
seh
alek
williams
know
a
hoss
he
do
he
don
know
a
hoss
from
a
pig
the
laugh
that
followed
was
like
the
rattle
of
pebbles
trescott
turned
and
looked
sternly
and
coldly
at
the
dim
form
in
the
gloom
from
the
henry
he
said
i
did
say
anything
about
horses
i
was
saying
hoss
hoss
said
the
quavering
voice
from
these
near
shadows
hoss
i
don
know
all
erbout
a
boss
i
do
there
was
a
satirical
chuckle
at
the
end
of
three
miles
the
mare
slackened
and
the
doctor
leaned
forward
peering
while
holding
tight
reins
the
wheels
of
the
buggy
bumped
often
over
bowlders
a
window
shone
forth
a
simple
square
of
topaz
on
a
great
black
four
dogs
charged
the
buggy
with
ferocity
and
when
it
did
not
promptly
retreat
they
circled
courageously
around
the
flanks
baying
a
door
opened
near
the
window
in
the
and
a
man
came
and
stood
on
a
beach
of
yellow
light
yah
yah
you
roveh
you
susie
come
yah
come
yah
this
minit
trescott
called
across
the
dark
sea
of
grass
hello
alek
hello
come
down
here
and
show
me
where
to
drive
the
man
plunged
from
the
beach
into
the
surf
and
trescott
could
then
only
trace
his
course
by
the
fervid
and
polite
ejaculations
of
a
host
who
was
somewhere
approaching
presently
williams
took
the
mare
by
the
head
and
uttering
cries
of
welcome
and
scolding
the
swarming
dogs
led
the
equipage
towards
the
lights
when
they
halted
at
the
door
and
trescott
was
climbing
out
williams
cried
will
she
stand
docteh
she
stand
all
right
but
you
better
hold
her
for
a
minute
now
henry
the
doctor
turned
and
held
both
arms
to
the
dark
figure
it
crawled
to
him
painfully
like
a
man
going
down
a
ladder
williams
took
the
mare
away
to
be
tied
to
a
little
tree
and
when
he
returned
he
found
them
awaiting
him
in
the
gloom
beyond
the
rays
from
the
door
he
burst
out
then
like
a
siphon
pressed
by
a
nervous
thumb
hennery
hennery
ma
ol
frien
well
if
i
ain
glade
if
i
ain
glade
trescott
had
taken
the
silent
shape
by
the
arm
and
led
it
forward
into
the
full
revelation
of
the
light
well
now
alek
you
can
take
henry
and
put
him
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
i
will
near
the
end
of
this
sentence
old
williams
had
come
front
to
front
with
johnson
he
gasped
for
a
second
and
then
yelled
the
yell
of
a
man
stabbed
in
the
heart
for
a
fraction
of
a
moment
trescott
seemed
to
be
looking
for
epithets
then
he
roared
you
old
black
chump
you
old
black
shut
up
shut
up
do
you
hear
williams
obeyed
instantly
in
the
matter
of
his
screams
but
he
continued
in
a
lowered
voice
ma
lode
amassy
who
ever
think
ma
lode
amassy
trescott
spoke
again
in
the
manner
of
a
commander
of
a
battalion
alek
the
old
negro
again
surrendered
but
to
himself
he
repeated
in
a
whisper
ma
lode
he
was
aghast
and
trembling
as
these
three
points
of
widening
shadows
approached
the
golden
doorway
a
hale
old
negress
appeared
there
bowing
docteh
come
in
come
in
she
had
evidently
just
retired
from
a
tempestuous
struggle
to
place
the
room
in
order
but
she
was
now
bowing
rapidly
she
made
the
effort
of
a
person
swimming
do
trouble
yourself
mary
said
trescott
entering
i
brought
henry
for
you
to
take
care
of
and
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
carry
out
what
i
tell
you
learning
that
he
was
not
followed
he
faced
the
door
and
said
come
in
henry
johnson
entered
whee
shrieked
williams
she
almost
achieved
a
back
somersault
six
young
members
of
the
tribe
of
williams
made
a
simultaneous
plunge
for
a
position
behind
the
stove
and
formed
a
wailing
heap
xiii
you
know
very
well
that
you
and
your
family
lived
usually
on
less
than
three
dollars
a
week
and
now
that
trescott
pays
you
five
dollars
a
week
for
johnson
board
you

stroke
of
work
since

began
to
board
with
you
everybody

and
so
what
are
you
kicking
about
the
judge
sat
in
his
chair
on
the
porch
fondling
his
cane
and
gazing
down
at
old
williams
who
stood
under
the
yes
i
know
jedge
said
the
negro
wagging
his
head
in
a
puzzled
manner
like

the

sharply

family
of
sparrows
and
now
when
you
are
in
a
more
prosperous
condition
than
ever
before
you
come
around
talking
like
an
old
fool
the
negro
began
to
scratch
his
head
yeh

he
said
at
last

ol

cai

the

irascibly

without
receiving

callers

williams
with
an
air

deeper
stupefaction

the
old
negro
seemed
to
be
seeking
a
way
to
elude
this
argument
but
evidently
finding
none
he
was
about
to
shuffle
meekly
off
he
halted
however
jedge
said
he
ma
ol
near
driv
abstracted

responded
the
judge
williams
came
very
close
and
peered
solemnly
through
a
branch
of
lilac
judge
he
whispered
the
chillens
what
about
them
dropping
his
voice
to
funereal
depths
williams
said
they

little

in
answer
williams
said
with
mournful
emphasis
hennery
moved
with
a
kind
of
satisfaction
at
his
tragic
use
of
the
name
he
remained
staring
at
the
judge
for
a
sign
of
its
effect
the
judge
made
a
gesture
of
irritation
come

through
the
trees

williams
spoke
these
sentences
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
after
a
silence
of
deep
reflection
he
continued

slowly

the
judge

the
judge
stick
came
down
sharply
and
suddenly
upon
the
floor
of
the
porch
there
he
said
i
thought
that
was
what
you
were
driving
at
williams
began
swinging
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
the
strange
racial
mannerism
now
hol
on
a
minnet
jedge
he
said
defensively
like

before

life
williams
at
once
drew
himself
up
with
great
dignity
but
in
the
pause
after
that
question
he
drooped
gradually
to
another
attitude
in
the
end
he
answered
heroically
no
jedge
i
an
like
as
if
i
was
five
dollehs

repeated
with
a
great
impressive
gesture
fer
this
kinder
wuk

he
laid
a
terrible
emphasis
upon
the
final
word
the
judge
laughed
i
know
trescott
mind
concerning
this
affair
alek
and
if
you
are
dissatisfied
with
your
boarder
he
is
quite
ready
to

him
to
some
other
place
so
if
you

to

word
with
me
that
you
are
tired
of
the
arrangement
and
wish

changed
he

williams
scratched
his
head
again
in
deep
perplexity
five
dollehs
is
er
big
price
fer
bo
but
no
big
price
fer
the
bo
of
er
crazy
man
he
said
finally
what
do
you
think
you
ought
to
get
asked
the
judge
well
answered
alek
in
the
manner
of
one
deep
in
a
balancing
of
the
scales
he
looks
like
er
devil
an
done
skears
an
ma
chillens
cai

an
you
told
me
all
those
things
after
scratching
his
wool
and
beating
his
knee
with
his
hat
and
gazing
off
through
the
trees
and
down
at
the
ground
williams
said
as
he
kicked
nervously
at
the
gravel
well
jedge
i
think
it
is
wuth
he
stuttered
worth
what
six
dollehs
answered
williams
in
a
desperate
outburst
the
judge
lay
back
in
his
great
and
went
through
all
the
motions
of
a
man
laughing
heartily
but
he
made
no
sound
save
a
slight
cough
williams
had
been
watching
him
with
apprehension
well
said
the
judge
do
you
call
six
dollars
a
salary
no
seh
promptly
responded
williams
a
salary
no
a
salary
he
looked
with
some
anger
upon
the
man
who
questioned
his
intelligence
in
this
way
well
supposing
your
children
ca
eat
i
and
supposing
he
looks
like
a
devil
and
supposing
all
those
things
continue
would
you
be
satisfied
with
six
dollars
a
week
recollections
seemed
to
throng
in
williams
mind
at
these
interrogations
and
he
answered
dubiously
of
a
man
who
right
in
his
haid
an
looks
like
er
devil
but
six
dollehs
after
these
two
attempts
at
a
sentence
williams
suddenly
appeared
as
an
orator
with
a
great
shiny
palm
waving
in
the
air
i
tell
yeh
jedge
six
dollehs

but
if

xiv
reifsnyder
assistant
had
gone
to
his
supper
and
the
owner
of
the
shop
was
trying
to
placate
four
men
who
wished
to
be
shaved
at
once
reifsnyder
was
very
garrulous
a
fact
which
made
him
rather
remarkable
among
barbers
who
as
a
class
are
austerely
speechless
having
been
taught
silence
by
the
hammering
reiteration
of
a
tradition
it
is
the
customers
who
talk
in
the
ordinary
event
as
reifsnyder
waved
his
razor
down
the
cheek
of
a
man
in
the
chair
he
turned
often
to
cool
the
impatience
of
the
others
with
pleasant
talk
which
they
did
not
particularly
heed
oh
he
should
have
let
him
die
said
bainbridge
a
railway
engineer
finally
replying
to
one
of
the
barber
orations
shut
up
reif
and
go
on
with
your
business
instead
reifsnyder
paused
shaving
entirely
and
turned
to
front
the
speaker
let
him
die
he
demanded
how
vas
that
how
can
you
let
a
man
die
by
letting
him
die
you
chump
said
the
engineer
the
others
laughed
a
little
and
reifsnyder
turned
at
once
to
his
work
sullenly
as
a
man
overwhelmed
by
the
derision
of
numbers
how
vas
that
he
grumbled
later
how
can
you
let
a
man
die
when
he
vas
done
so
much
for
you
he
vas
done
so
much
for
you
repeated
bainbridge
you
better
shave
some
people
how
vas
that
maybe
this
ai
a
barber
shop
a
man
hitherto
silent
now
said
if
i
had
been
the
doctor
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
of
course
said
reifsnyder
any
man
vould
do
it
any
man
that
vas
not
like
you
you
old
fish
he
had
sought
the
final
words
with
painful
care
and
he
delivered
the
collection
triumphantly
at
bainbridge
the
engineer
laughed
the
man
in
the
chair
now
lifted
himself
higher
while
reifsnyder
began
an
elaborate
ceremony
of
anointing
and
combing
his
hair
now
free
to
join
comfortably
in
the
talk
the
man
said
they
say
he
is
the
most
terrible
thing
in
the
world
young
johnnie
bernard
that
drives
the
grocery
wagon
saw
him
up
at
alek
williams
shanty
and
he
says
he
could
eat
anything
for
two
days
chee
said
reifsnyder
well
what
makes
him
so
terrible
asked
another
because
he
has
got
any
face
replied
the
barber
and
the
engineer
in
duct
has
got
any
face
repeated
the
man
how
can
he
do
without
any
face
he
has
no
face
in
the
front
of
his
head
in
the
place
where
his
face
ought
to
grow
bainbridge
sang
these
lines
pathetically
as
he
arose
and
hung
his
hat
on
a
hook
the
man
in
the
chair
was
about
to
abdicate
in
his
favor
get
a
gait
on
you
now
he
said
to
reifsnyder
i
go
out
at
as
the
barber
foamed
the
lather
on
the
cheeks
of
the
engineer
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
heavily
then
suddenly
he
burst
out
how
would
you
like
to
be
with
no
face
he
cried
to
the
assemblage
oh
if
i
had
to
have
a
face
like
yours
answered
one
customer
bainbridge
voice
came
from
a
sea
of
lather
you
kicking
because
if
losing
faces
became
popular
you
have
to
go
out
of
business
i
do
think
it
will
become
so
much
popular
said
reifsnyder
not
if
it
got
to
be
taken
off
in
the
way
his
was
taken
off
said
another
man
i
rather
keep
mine
if
you
do
mind
i
guess
so
cried
the
barber
just
think
the
shaving
of
bainbridge
had
arrived
at
a
time
of
comparative
liberty
for
him
i
wonder
what
the
doctor
says
to
himself
he
observed
he
may
be
sorry
he
made
him
live
it
was
the
only
thing
he
could
do
replied
a
man
the
others
seemed
to
agree
with
him
supposing
you
were
in
his
place
said
one
and
johnson
had
saved
your
kid
what
would
you
do
certainly
of
course
you
would
do
anything
on
earth
for
him
you
take
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
for
him
and
spend
your
last
dollar
on
him
well
then
i
wonder
how
it
feels
to
be
without
any
face
said
reifsnyder
musingly
the
man
who
had
previously
spoken
feeling
that
he
had
expressed
himself
well
repeated
the
whole
thing
you
would
do
anything
on
earth
for
him
you
take
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
for
him
and
spend
your
last
dollar
on
him
well
then
no
but
look
said
reifsnyder
supposing
you
do
got
a
face
xv
as
soon
as
williams
was
hidden
from
the
view
of
the
old
judge
he
began
to
gesture
and
talk
to
himself
an
elation
had
evidently
penetrated
to
his
vitals
and
caused
him
to
dilate
as
if
he
had
been
filled
with
gas
he
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
air
and
whistled
fragments
of
triumphal
music
at
times
in
his
progress
towards
his
shanty
he
indulged
in
a
shuffling
movement
that
was
really
a
dance
it
was
to
be
learned
from
the
intermediate
monologue
that
he
had
emerged
from
his
trials
laurelled
and
proud
he
was
the
unconquerable
alexander
williams
nothing
could
exceed
the
bold
of
his
manner
his
kingly
stride
his
heroic
song
the
derisive
flourish
of
his
hands
all
betokened
a
man
who
had
successfully
defied
the
world
on
his
way
he
saw
zeke
paterson
coming
to
town
they
hailed
each
other
at
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
how
do
broth
paterson
how
do
broth
williams
they
were
both
deacons
is
you
folks
well
broth
paterson
middlin
middlin
how
you
folks
broth
williams
neither
of
them
had
slowed
his
pace
in
the
smallest
degree
they
had
simply
begun
this
talk
when
a
considerable
space
separated
them
continued
it
as
they
passed
and
added
polite
questions
as
they
drifted
steadily
apart
williams
mind
seemed
to
be
a
balloon
he
had
been
so
inflated
that
he
had
not
noticed
that
paterson
had
definitely
shied
into
the
dry
ditch
as
they
came
to
the
point
of
ordinary
contact
afterwards
as
he
went
a
lonely
way
he
burst
out
again
in
song
and
pantomimic
celebration
of
his
estate
his
feet
moved
in
prancing
steps
when
he
came
in
sight
of
his
cabin
the
fields
were
bathed
in
a
blue
dusk
and
the
light
in
the
window
was
pale
cavorting
and
gesticulating
he
gazed
joyfully
for
some
moments
upon
this
light
then
suddenly
another
idea
seemed
to
attack
his
mind
and
he
stopped
with
an
air
of
being
suddenly
dampened
in
the
end
he
approached
his
home
as
if
it
were
the
fortress
of
an
enemy
some
dogs
disputed
his
advance
for
a
loud
moment
and
then
discovering
their
lord
slunk
away
embarrassed
his
reproaches
were
addressed
to
them
in
muffled
tones
arriving
at
the
door
he
pushed
it
open
with
the
timidity
of
a
new
thief
he
thrust
his
head
cautiously
sideways
and
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
his
wife
who
sat
by
the
table
the
defining
a
half
of
her
face
sh
he
said
uselessly
his
glance
travelled
swiftly
to
the
inner
door
which
shielded
the
one
the
pickaninnies
strewn
upon
the
floor
of
the
were
softly
snoring
after
a
hearty
meal
they
had
promptly
dispersed
themselves
about
the
place
and
gone
to
sleep
said
williams
again
to
his
motionless
and
silent
wife
he
had
allowed
only
his
head
to
appear
his
wife
with
one
hand
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
and
the
other
at
her
knee
was
regarding
him
with
wide
eyes
and
parted
lips
as
if
he
were
a
spectre
she
looked
to
be
one
who
was
living
in
terror
and
even
the
familiar
face
at
the
door
had
thrilled
her
because
it
had
come
suddenly
williams
broke
the
tense
silence
is
he
all
right
he
whispered
waving
his
eyes
towards
the
inner
door
following
his
glance
timorously
his
wife
nodded
and
in
a
low
tone
answered
i
raikon
he
done
gone
t
sleep
williams
then
slunk
noiselessly
across
his
threshold
he
lifted
a
chair
and
with
infinite
care
placed
it
so
that
it
faced
the
dreaded
inner
door
his
wife
moved
slightly
so
as
to
also
squarely
face
it
a
silence
came
upon
them
in
which
they
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
a
calamity
pealing
and
deadly
williams
finally
coughed
behind
his
hand
his
wife
started
and
looked
upon
him
in
alarm
pears
like
he
done
gwine
keep
quiet
ternight
he
breathed
they
continually
pointed
their
speech
and
their
looks
at
the
inner
door
paying
it
the
homage
due
to
a
corpse
or
a
phantom
another
long
stillness
followed
this
sentence
their
eyes
shone
white
and
wide
a
wagon
rattled
down
the
distant
road
from
their
chairs
they
looked
at
the
window
and
the
effect
of
the
light
in
the
cabin
was
a
presentation
of
an
intensely
black
and
solemn
night
the
old
woman
adopted
the
attitude
used
always
in
church
at
funerals
at
times
she
seemed
to
be
upon
the
point
of
breaking
out
in
prayer
he
mighty
quiet
whispered
williams
was
he
good
for
answer
his
wife
raised
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
in
the
supplication
of
job
williams
moved
restlessly
finally
he
tiptoed
to
the
door
he
knelt
slowly
and
without
a
sound
and
placed
his
ear
near
the
hearing
a
noise
behind
him
he
turned
quickly
his
wife
was
staring
at
him
aghast
she
stood
in
front
of
the
stove
and
her
arms
were
spread
out
in
the
natural
movement
to
protect
all
her
sleeping
ducklings
but
williams
arose
without
having
touched
the
door
i
raikon
he
he
said
fingering
his
wool
he
debated
with
himself
for
some
time
during
this
interval
his
wife
remained
a
great
fat
statue
of
a
mother
shielding
her
children
it
was
plain
that
his
mind
was
swept
suddenly
by
a
wave
of
temerity
with
a
sounding
step
he
moved
towards
the
door
his
fingers
were
almost
upon
the
knob
when
he
swiftly
ducked
and
dodged
away
clapping
his
hands
to
the
back
of
his
head
it
was
as
if
the
portal
had
threatened
him
there
was
a
little
tumult
near
the
stove
where
williams
desperate
retreat
had
involved
her
feet
with
the
prostrate
children
after
the
panic
williams
bore
traces
of
a
feeling
of
shame
he
returned
to
the
charge
he
firmly
grasped
the
knob
with
his
left
hand
and
with
his
other
hand
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
he
pushed
the
door
and
as
it
swung
portentously
open
he
sprang
nimbly
to
one
side
like
the
fearful
slave
liberating
the
lion
near
the
stove
a
group
had
formed
the
terror
stricken
mother
with
her
arms
stretched
and
the
aroused
children
clinging
frenziedly
to
her
skirts
the
light
streamed
after
the
swinging
door
and
disclosed
a
room
six
feet
one
way
and
six
feet
the
other
way
it
was

williams
peered
warily
around
the
corner
made
by
the
suddenly
he
advanced
retired
and
advanced
again
with
a
howl
his
palsied
family
had
expected
him
to
spring
backward
and
at
his
howl
they
heaped
themselves
wondrously
but
williams
simply
stood
in
the
little
room
emitting
his
howls
before
an
open
window
he
gone
gone
he
gone
his
eye
and
his
hand
had
speedily
proved
the
fact
he
had
even
thrown
open
a
little
cupboard
presently
he
came
flying
out
he
grabbed
his
hat
and
hurled
the
outer
door
back
upon
its
hinges
then
he
tumbled
headlong
into
the
night
he
was
yelling
docteh
trescott
docteh
trescott
he
ran
wildly
through
the
fields
and
galloped
in
the
direction
of
town
he
continued
to
call
to
trescott
as
if
the
latter
was
within
easy
hearing
it
was
as
if
trescott
was
poised
in
the
contemplative
sky
over
the
running
negro
and
could
heed
this
reaching
voice
docteh
trescott
in
the
cabin
williams
supported
by
relays
from
the
battalion
of
children
stood
quaking
watch
until
the
truth
of
daylight
came
as
a
reinforcement
and
made
the
arrogant
strutting
swashbuckler
children
and

proclaimed
her
illimitable
courage

xvi
theresa
page
was
giving
a
party
it
was
the
outcome
of
a
long
series
of
arguments
addressed
to
her
mother
which
had
been
overheard
in
part
by
her
father
he
had
at
last
said
five
words
oh
let
her
have
it
the
mother
had
then
gladly
capitulated
theresa
had
written
nineteen
invitations
and
distributed
them
at
recess
to
her
schoolmates
later
her
mother
had
composed
five
large
cakes
and
still
later
a
vast
amount
of
lemonade
so
the
nine
little
girls
and
the
ten
little
boys
sat
quite
primly
in
the
while
theresa
and
her
mother
plied
them
with
cake
and
lemonade
and
also
with
this
primness
sat
now
quite
strangely
upon
them
it
was
owing
to
the
presence
of
mrs
page
previously
in
the
parlor
alone
with
their
games
they
had
overturned
a
chair
the
boys
had
let
more
or
less
of
their
hoodlum
spirit
shine
forth
but
when
circumstances
could
be
possibly
magnified
to
warrant
it
the
girls
made
the
boys
victims
of
an
insufferable
pride
snubbing
them
mercilessly
so
in
the
they
resembled
a
class
at
if
it
were
not
for
the
subterranean
smiles
gestures
rebuffs
and
poutings
which
stamped
the
affair
as
a
children
party
two
little
girls
of
this
subdued
gathering
were
planted
in
a
settle
with
their
backs
to
the
broad
window
they
were
beaming
lovingly
upon
each
other
with
an
effect
of
scorning
the
boys
hearing
a
noise
behind
her
at
the
window
one
little
girl
turned
to
face
it
instantly
she
screamed
and
sprang
away
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
what
was
it
what
was
it
cried
every
one
in
a
roar
some
slight
movement
of
the
eyes
of
the
weeping
and
shuddering
child
informed
the
company
that
she
had
been
frightened
by
an
appearance
at
the
window
at
once
they
all
faced
the
imperturbable
window
and
for
a
moment
there
was
a
silence
an
astute
lad
made
an
immediate
census
of
the
other
lads
the
prank
of
slipping
out
and
looming
spectrally
at
a
window
was
too
venerable
but
the
little
boys
were
all
present
and
astonished
as
they
recovered
their
minds
they
uttered
warlike
cries
and
through
a
side
door
sallied
rapidly
out
against
the
terror
they
vied
with
each
other
in
daring
none
wished
particularly
to
encounter
a
dragon
in
the
darkness
of
the
garden
but
there
could
be
no
faltering
when
the
fair
ones
in
the
were
present
calling
to
each
other
in
stern
voices
they
went
dragooning
over
the
lawn
attacking
the
shadows
with
ferocity
but
still
with
the
caution
of
reasonable
beings
they
found
however
nothing
new
to
the
peace
of
the
night
of
course
there
was
a
lad
who
told
a
great
lie
he
described
a
grim
figure
bending
low
and
slinking
off
along
the
fence
he
gave
a
number
of
details
rendering
his
lie
more
splendid
by
a
repetition
of
certain
forms
which
he
recalled
from
romances
for
instance
he
insisted
that
he
had
heard
the
creature
emit
a
hollow
laugh
inside
the
house
the
little
girl
who
had
raised
the
alarm
was
still
shuddering
and
weeping
with
the
utmost
difficulty
was
she
brought
to
a
state
approximating
calmness
by
mrs
page
then
she
wanted
to
go
home
at
once
page
entered
the
house
at
this
time
he
had
exiled
himself
until
he
concluded
that
this
children
party
was
finished
and
gone
he
was
obliged
to
escort
the
little
girl
home
because
she
screamed
again
when
they
opened
the
door
and
she
saw
the
night
she
was
not
coherent
even
to
her
mother
was
it
a
man
she
know
it
was
simply
a
thing
a
dreadful
thing
xvii
in
watermelon
alley
the
farraguts
were
spending
their
evening
as
usual
on
the
little
rickety
porch
sometimes
they
howled
gossip
to
other
people
on
other
rickety
porches
the
thin
wail
of
a
baby
arose
from
a
near
house
a
man
had
a
terrific
altercation
with
his
wife
to
which
the
alley
paid
no
attention
at
all
there
appeared
suddenly
before
the
farraguts
a
monster
making
a
low
and
sweeping
bow
there
was
an
instant
pause
and
then
occurred
something
that
resembled
the
effect
of
an
upheaval
of
the
surface
the
old
woman
hurled
herself
backward
with
a
dreadful
cry
young
sim
had
been
perched
gracefully
on
a
railing
at
sight
of
the
monster
he
simply
fell
over
it
to
the
ground
he
made
no
sound
his
eyes
stuck
out
his
nerveless
hands
tried
to
grapple
the
rail
to
prevent
a
tumble
and
then
he
vanished
bella
blubbering
and
with
her
hair
suddenly
and
mysteriously
dishevelled
was
crawling
on
her
hands
and
knees
fearsomely
up
the
steps
standing
before
this
wreck
of
a
family
gathering
the
monster
continued
to
bow
it
even
raised
a
deprecatory
claw

the
girl
cast
a
miserable
glance
behind
her
she
was
still
crawling
away
on
the
ground
beside
the
porch
young
sim
raised
a
strange
bleat
which
expressed
both
his
fright
and
his
lack
of
wind
presently
the
monster
with
a
fashionable
amble
ascended
the
steps
after
the
girl
she
grovelled
in
a
corner
of
the
room
as
the
creature
took
a
chair
it
seated
itself
very
elegantly
on
the
edge
it
held
an
old
cap
in
both
hands

with

in
a
last
outbreak
of
despair
the
girl
shuddering
and
wailing
threw
herself
face
downward
on
the
floor
while
the
monster
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
gabbling
courteous
invitations
and
holding
the
old
hat
daintily
to
his
stomach
at
the
back
of
the
house
farragut
who
was
of
enormous
weight
and
who
for
eight
years
had
done
little
more
than
sit
in
an
armchair
and
describe
her
various
ailments
had
with
speed
and
agility
scaled

the
black
mass
in
the
middle
of
trescott
property
was
hardly
allowed
to
cool
before
the
builders
were
at
work
on
another
house
it
had
sprung
upward
at
a
fabulous
rate
it
was
like
a
magical
composition
born
of
the
ashes
the
doctor
office
was
the
first
part
to
be
completed
and
he
had
already
moved
in
his
new
books
and
instruments
and
medicines
trescott
sat
before
his
desk
when
the
chief
of
police
arrived
well
we
found
him
said
the
latter
did
you
cried
the
doctor
where
shambling
around
the
streets
at
daylight
this
morning
i
be
blamed
if
i
can
figure
on
where
he
passed
the
night
where
is
he
now
oh
we
jugged
him
i
did
know
what
else
to
do
with
him
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me
of
course
we
ca
keep
him
no
charge
could
be
made
you
know
i
come
down
and
get
him
the
official
grinned
retrospectively
must
say
he
had
a
fine
career
while
he
was
out
first
thing
he
did
was
to
break
up
a
party
at
page
then
he
went
to
watermelon
alley
whoo
he
stampeded
the
whole
outfit
men
women
and
children
running
and
yelling
they
say
one
old
woman
broke
her
leg
or
something
shinning
over
a
fence
then
he
went
right
out
on
the
main
street
and
an
irish
girl
threw
a
fit
and
there
was
a
sort
of
a
riot
he
began
to
run
and
a
big
crowd
chased
him
firing
rocks
but
he
gave
them
the
slip
somehow
down
there
by
the
foundry
and
in
the
railroad
yard
we
looked
for
him
all
night
but
could
find
him
was
he
hurt
any
did
anybody
hit
him
with
a
stone
guess
there
is
much
of
him
to
hurt
any
more
is
there
guess
been
hurt
up
to
the
limit
no
they
never
touched
him
of
course
nobody
really
wanted
to
hit
him
but
you
know
how
a
crowd
gets
like
it
like
yes
i
know
for
a
moment
the
chief
of
the
police
looked
reflectively
at
the
floor
then
he
spoke
hesitatingly
you
know
jake
winter
little
girl
was
the
one
that
he
scared
at
the
party
she
is
pretty
sick
they
say
is
she
why
they
did
call
me
i
always
attend
the
winter
family
no
did
they
asked
the
chief
slowly
well
you
know
winter
is
well
winter
has
gone
clean
crazy
over
this
business
he
wanted
he
wanted
to
have
you
arrested
have
me
arrested
the
idiot
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
he
have
me
arrested
for
of
course
he
is
a
fool
i
told
him
to
keep
his
trap
shut
but
then
you
know
how
he
go
all
over
town
yapping
about
the
thing
i
thought
i
better
tip
you
oh
he
is
of
no
consequence
but
then
of
course
i
obliged
to
you
sam
that
all
right
well
you
be
down
tonight
and
take
him
out
eh
you
get
a
good
welcome
from
the
jailer
he
do
like
his
job
for
a
cent
he
says
you
can
have
your
man
whenever
you
want
him
he
got
no
use
for
him
but
what
is
this
business
of
winter
about
having
me
arrested
oh
it
a
lot
of
chin
about
your
having
no
right
to
allow
this
this
this
man
to
be
at
large
but
i
told
him
to
tend
to
his
own
business
only
i
thought
i
better
let
you
know
and
i
might
as
well
say
right
now
doctor
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
this
thing
if
i
were
you
i
come
to
the
jail
pretty
late
at
night
because
there
is
likely
to
be
a
crowd
around
the
door
and
i
bring
a
er
mask
or
some
kind
of
a
veil
anyhow
xix
martha
goodwin
was
single
and
well
along
into
the
thin
years
she
lived
with
her
married
sister
in
whilomville
she
performed
nearly
all
the
in
exchange
for
the
privilege
of
existence
every
one
tacitly
recognized
her
labor
as
a
form
of
penance
for
the
early
end
of
her
betrothed
who
had
died
of
which
he
had
not
caught
from
her
but
despite
the
strenuous
and
unceasing
workaday
of
her
life
she
was
a
woman
of
great
mind
she
had
adamantine
opinions
upon
the
situation
in
armenia
the
condition
of
women
in
china
the
flirtation
between
minster
of
niagara
avenue
and
young
griscom
the
conflict
in
the
bible
class
of
the
baptist
the
duty
of
the
united
states
towards
the
cuban
insurgents
and
many
other
colossal
matters
her
fullest
experience
of
violence
was
gained
on
an
occasion
when
she
had
seen
a
hound
clubbed
but
in
the
plan
which
she
had
made
for
the
reform
of
the
world
she
advocated
drastic
measures
for
instance
she
contended
that
all
the
turks
should
be
pushed
into
the
sea
and
drowned
and
that
minster
and
young
griscom
should
be
hanged
side
by
side
on
twin
gallows
in
fact
this
woman
of
peace
who
had
seen
only
peace
argued
constantly
for
a
creed
of
illimitable
ferocity
she
was
invulnerable
on
these
questions
because
eventually
she
overrode
all
opponents
with
a
sniff
this
sniff
was
an
active
force
it
was
to
her
antagonists
like
a
bang
over
the
head
and
none
was
known
to
recover
from
this
expression
of
exalted
contempt
it
left
them
windless
and
conquered
they
never
again
came
forward
as
candidates
for
suppression
and
martha
walked
her
kitchen
with
a
stern
brow
an
invincible
being
like
napoleon
nevertheless
her
acquaintances
from
the
pain
of
their
defeats
had
been
long
in
secret
revolt
it
was
in
no
wise
a
conspiracy
because
they
did
not
care
to
state
their
open
rebellion
but
nevertheless
it
was
understood
that
any
woman
who
could
not
coincide
with
one
of
martha
contentions
was
entitled
to
the
support
of
others
in
the
small
circle
it
amounted
to
an
arrangement
by
which
all
were
required
to
disbelieve
any
theory
for
which
martha
fought
this
however
did
not
prevent
them
from
speaking
of
her
mind
with
profound
respect
two
people
bore
the
brunt
of
her
ability
her
sister
kate
was
visibly
afraid
of
her
while
carrie
dungen
sailed
across
from
her
kitchen
to
sit
respectfully
at
martha
feet
and
learn
the
business
of
the
world
to
be
sure
afterwards
under
another
sun
she
always
laughed
at
martha
and
pretended
to
deride
her
ideas
but
in
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
she
always
remained
silent
or
admiring
kate
the
sister
was
of
no
consequence
at
all
her
principal
delusion
was
that
she
did
all
the
work
in
the
rooms
of
the
house
while
martha
did
it
the
truth
was
seen
only
by
the
husband
who
treated
martha
with
a
kindness
that
was
half
banter
half
deference
martha
herself
had
no
suspicion
that
she
was
the
only
pillar
of
the
domestic
edifice
the
situation
was
without
definitions
martha
made
definitions
but
she
devoted
them
entirely
to
the
armenians
and
griscom
and
the
chinese
and
other
subjects
her
dreams
which
in
early
days
had
been
of
love
of
meadows
and
the
shade
of
trees
of
the
face
of
a
man
were
now
involved
otherwise
and
they
were
companioned
in
the
kitchen
curiously
cuba
the
kettle
armenia
the
washing
of
the
dishes
and
the
whole
thing
being
jumbled
in
regard
to
social
misdemeanors
she
who
was
simply
the
mausoleum
of
a
dead
passion
was
probably
the
most
savage
critic
in
town
this
unknown
woman
hidden
in
a
kitchen
as
in
a
well
was
sure
to
have
a
considerable
effect
of
the
one
kind
or
the
other
in
the
life
of
the
town
every
time
it
moved
a
yard
she
had
personally
contributed
an
inch
she
could
hammer
so
stoutly
upon
the
door
of
a
proposition
that
it
would
break
from
its
hinges
and
fall
upon
her
but
at
any
rate
it
moved
she
was
an
engine
and
the
fact
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
an
engine
contributed
largely
to
the
effect
one
reason
that
she
was
formidable
was
that
she
did
not
even
imagine
that
she
was
formidable
she
remained
a
weak
innocent
and
creature
who
alone
would
defy
the
universe
if
she
thought
the
universe
merited
this
proceeding
one
day
carrie
dungen
came
across
from
her
kitchen
with
speed
she
had
a
great
deal
of
grist
oh
she
cried
henry
johnson
got
away
from
where
they
was
keeping
him
and
came
to
town
last
night
and
scared
everybody
almost
to
death
martha
was
shining
a
polishing
madly
no
reasonable
person
could
see
cause
for
this
operation
because
the
pan
already
glistened
like
silver
well
she
ejaculated
she
imparted
to
the
word
a
deep
meaning
this
my
prophecy
has
come
to
pass
it
was
a
habit
the
overplus
of
information
was
choking
carrie
before
she
could
go
on
she
was
obliged
to
struggle
for
a
moment
and
oh
little
sadie
winter
is
awful
sick
and
they
say
jake
winter
was
around
this
morning
trying
to
get
doctor
trescott
arrested
and
poor
old
farragut
sprained
her
ankle
in
trying
to
climb
a
fence
and
there
a
crowd
around
the
jail
all
the
time
they
put
henry
in
jail
because
they
did
know
what
else
to
do
with
him
i
guess
they
say
he
is
perfectly
terrible
martha
finally
released
the
and
confronted
the
headlong
speaker
well
she
said
again
poising
a
great
brown
rag
kate
had
heard
the
excited
and
drifted
down
from
the
novel
in
her
room
she
was
a
shivery
little
woman
her
seemed
to
be
two
panes
of
ice
for
she
was
constantly
shrugging
and
shrugging
serves
him
right
if
he
was
to
lose
all
his
patients
she
said
suddenly
in
tones
she
snipped
her
words
out
as
if
her
lips
were
scissors
well
he
likely
to
shouted
carrie
dungen
do
a
lot
of
people
say
that
they
wo
have
him
any
more
if
you
sick
and
nervous
doctor
trescott
would
scare
the
life
out
of
you
would
he
he
would
me
i
keep
thinking
martha
stalking
to
and
fro
sometimes
surveyed
the
two
other
women
with
a
contemplative
frown
xx
after
the
return
from
connecticut
little
jimmie
was
at
first
much
afraid
of
the
monster
who
lived
in
the
room
over
the
he
could
not
identify
it
in
any
way
gradually
however
his
fear
dwindled
under
the
influence
of
a
weird
fascination
he
sidled
into
closer
and
closer
relations
with
it
one
time
the
monster
was
seated
on
a
box
behind
the
stable
basking
in
the
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
a
heavy
crepe
veil
was
swathed
about
its
head
little
jimmie
and
many
companions
came
around
the
corner
of
the
stable
they
were
all
in
what
was
popularly
known
as
the
baby
class
and
consequently
escaped
from
school
a
before
the
other
children
they
halted
abruptly
at
sight
of
the
figure
on
the
box
jimmie
waved
his
hand
with
the
air
of
a
proprietor
there
he
is
he
said
murmured
all
the
little
boys
they
shrank
back
and
grouped
according
to
courage
or
experience
as
at
the
sound
the
monster
slowly
turned
its
head
jimmie
had
remained
in
the
van
alone
do
be
afraid
i
wo
let
him
hurt
you
he
said
delighted
huh
they
replied
contemptuously
we
ai
afraid
jimmie
seemed
to
reap
all
the
joys
of
the
owner
and
exhibitor
of
one
of
the
world
marvels
while
his
audience
remained
at
a
distance
awed
and
entranced
fearful
and
envious
one
of
them
addressed
jimmie
gloomily
bet
you
dassent
walk
right
up
to
him
he
was
an
older
boy
than
jimmie
and
habitually
oppressed
him
to
a
small
degree
this
new
social
elevation
of
the
smaller
lad
probably
seemed
revolutionary
to
him
huh
said
jimmie
with
deep
scorn
dassent
i
dassent
i
hey
dassent
i
the
group
was
immensely
excited
it
turned
its
eyes
upon
the
boy
that
jimmie
addressed
no
you
dassent
he
said
stolidly
facing
a
moral
defeat
he
could
see
that
jimmie
was
resolved
no
you
dassent
he
repeated
doggedly
ho
cried
jimmie
you
just
watch
you
just
watch
amid
a
silence
he
turned
and
marched
towards
the
monster
but
possibly
the
palpable
wariness
of
his
companions
had
an
effect
upon
him
that
weighed
more
than
his
previous
experience
for
suddenly
when
near
to
the
monster
he
halted
dubiously
but
his
playmates
immediately
uttered
a
derisive
shout
and
it
seemed
to
force
him
forward
he
went
to
the
monster
and
laid
his
hand
delicately
on
its
shoulder
hello
henry
he
said
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
trifle
the
monster
was
crooning
a
weird
line
of
negro
melody
that
was
scarcely
more
than
a
thread
of
sound
and
it
paid
no
heed
to
the
boy
jimmie
strutted
back
to
his
companions
they
acclaimed
him
and
hooted
his
opponent
amid
this
clamor
the
larger
boy
with
difficulty
preserved
a
dignified
attitude
i
dassent
dassent
i
said
jimmie
to
him
now
you
so
smart
let
see
you
do
it
this
challenge
brought
forth
renewed
taunts
from
the
others
the
larger
boy
puffed
out
his
checks
well
i
ai
afraid
he
explained
sullenly
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
diplomacy
and
now
his
small
enemies
were
tumbling
his
prestige
all
about
his
ears
they
crowed
like
roosters
and
bleated
like
lambs
and
made
many
other
noises
which
were
supposed
to
bury
him
in
ridicule
and
dishonor
well
i
ai
afraid
he
continued
to
explain
through
the
din
jimmie
the
hero
of
the
mob
was
pitiless
you
ai
afraid
hey
he
sneered
if
you
ai
afraid
go
do
it
then
well
i
would
if
i
wanted
to
the
other
retorted
his
eyes
wore
an
expression
of
profound
misery
but
he
preserved
steadily
other
portions
of
a
air
he
suddenly
faced
one
of
his
persecutors
if
you
so
smart
why
do
you
go
do
it
this
persecutor
sank
promptly
through
the
group
to
the
rear
the
incident
gave
the
badgered
one
a
and
for
a
moment
even
turned
the
derision
in
another
direction
he
took
advantage
of
his
interval
i
do
it
if
anybody
else
will
he
announced
swaggering
to
and
fro
candidates
for
the
adventure
did
not
come
forward
to
defend
themselves
from
this
the
other
boys
again
set
up
their
crowing
and
bleating
for
a
while
they
would
hear
nothing
from
him
each
time
he
opened
his
lips
their
chorus
of
noises
made
oratory
impossible
but
at
last
he
was
able
to
repeat
that
he
would
volunteer
to
dare
as
much
in
the
affair
as
any
other
boy
well
you
go
first
they
shouted
but
jimmie
intervened
to
once
more
lead
the
populace
against
the
large
boy
you
mighty
brave
ai
you
he
said
to
him
you
dared
me
to
do
it
and
i
did
did
i
now
who
afraid
the
others
cheered
this
view
loudly
and
they
instantly
resumed
the
baiting
of
the
large
boy
he
shamefacedly
scratched
his
left
shin
with
his
right
foot
well
i
ai
afraid
he
cast
an
eye
at
the
monster
well
i
ai
afraid
with
a
glare
of
hatred
at
his
squalling
tormentors
he
finally
announced
a
grim
intention
well
i
do
it
then
since
you
so
fresh
now
the
mob
subsided
as
with
a
formidable
countenance
he
turned
towards
the
impassive
figure
on
the
box
the
advance
was
also
a
regular
progression
from
high
daring
to
craven
hesitation
at
last
when
some
yards
from
the
monster
the
lad
came
to
a
full
halt
as
if
he
had
encountered
a
stone
wall
the
observant
little
boys
in
the
distance
promptly
hooted
stung
again
by
these
cries
the
lad
sneaked
two
yards
forward
he
was
crouched
like
a
young
cat
ready
for
a
backward
spring
the
crowd
at
the
rear
beginning
to
respect
this
display
uttered
some
encouraging
cries
suddenly
the
lad
gathered
himself
together
made
a
white
and
desperate
rush
forward
touched
the
monster
shoulder
with
a
finger
and
sped
away
while
his
laughter
rang
out
wild
shrill
and
exultant
the
crowd
of
boys
reverenced
him
at
once
and
began
to
throng
into
his
camp
and
look
at
him
and
be
his
admirers
jimmie
was
discomfited
for
a
moment
but
he
and
the
larger
boy
without
agreement
or
word
of
any
kind
seemed
to
recognize
a
truce
and
they
swiftly
combined
and
began
to
parade
before
the
others
why
it
just
as
easy
as
nothing
puffed
the
larger
boy
ai
it
jim
course
blew
jimmie
why
it
as
they
were
people
of
another
class
if
they
had
been
decorated
for
courage
on
twelve
they
could
not
have
made
the
other
boys
more
ashamed
of
the
situation
meanwhile
they
condescended
to
explain
the
emotions
of
the
excursion
expressing
unqualified
contempt
for
any
one
who
could
hang
back
why
it
ai
nothin
he
wo
do
nothin
to
you
they
told
the
others
in
tones
of
exasperation
one
of
the
very
smallest
boys
in
the
party
showed
signs
of
a
wistful
desire
to
distinguish
himself
and
they
turned
their
attention
to
him
pushing
at
his
shoulders
while
he
swung
away
from
them
and
hesitated
dreamily
he
was
eventually
induced
to
make
furtive
expedition
but
it
was
only
for
a
few
yards
then
he
paused
motionless
gazing
with
open
mouth
the
vociferous
entreaties
of
jimmie
and
the
large
boy
had
no
power
over
him
hannigan
had
come
out
on
her
back
porch
with
a
pail
of
water
from
this
coign
she
had
a
view
of
the
secluded
portion
of
the
trescott
grounds
that
was
behind
the
stable
she
perceived
the
group
of
boys
and
the
monster
on
the
box
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
benefit
her
vision
she
screeched
then
as
if
she
was
being
murdered
eddie
eddie
you
come
home
this
minute
her
son
querulously
demanded
aw
what
for
you
come
home
this
minute
do
you
hear
the
other
boys
seemed
to
think
this
visitation
upon
one
of
their
number
required
them
to
preserve
for
a
time
the
air
of
a
collection
of
culprits
and
they
remained
in
guilty
silence
until
the
little
hannigan
wrathfully
protesting
was
pushed
through
the
door
of
his
home
hannigan
cast
a
piercing
glance
over
the
group
stared
with
a
bitter
face
at
the
trescott
house
as
if
this
new
and
handsome
edifice
was
insulting
her
and
then
followed
her
son
there
was
wavering
in
the
party
an
inroad
by
one
mother
always
caused
them
to
carefully
sweep
the
horizon
to
see
if
there
were
more
coming
this
is
my
yard
said
jimmie
proudly
we
do
have
to
go
home
the
monster
on
the
box
had
turned
its
black
crepe
countenance
towards
the
sky
and
was
waving
its
arms
in
time
to
a
religious
chant
look
at
him
now
cried
a
little
boy
they
turned
and
were
transfixed
by
the
solemnity
and
mystery
of
the
indefinable
gestures
the
wail
of
the
melody
was
mournful
and
slow
they
drew
back
it
seemed
to
spellbind
them
with
the
power
of
a
funeral
they
were
so
absorbed
that
they
did
not
hear
the
doctor
buggy
drive
up
to
the
stable
trescott
got
out
tied
his
horse
and
approached
the
group
jimmie
saw
him
first
and
at
his
look
of
dismay
the
others
wheeled
what
all
this
jimmie
asked
trescott
in
surprise
the
lad
advanced
to
the
front
of
his
companions
halted
and
said
nothing
trescott
face
gloomed
slightly
as
he
scanned
the
scene
what
were
you
doing
jimmie
we
was
playin
answered
jimmie
huskily
playing
at
what
just
playin
trescott
looked
gravely
at
the
other
boys
and
asked
them
to
please
go
home
they
proceeded
to
the
street
much
in
the
manner
of
frustrated
and
revealed
assassins
the
crime
of
trespass
on
another
boy
place
was
still
a
crime
when
they
had
only
accepted
the
other
boy
cordial
invitation
and
they
were
used
to
being
sent
out
of
all
manner
of
gardens
upon
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
father
or
a
mother
jimmie
had
wretchedly
watched
the
departure
of
his
companions
it
involved
the
loss
of
his
position
as
a
lad
who
controlled
the
privileges
of
his
father
grounds
but
then
he
knew
that
in
the
beginning
he
had
no
right
to
ask
so
many
boys
to
be
his
guests
once
on
the
sidewalk
however
they
speedily
forgot
their
shame
as
trespassers
and
the
large
boy
launched
forth
in
a
description
of
his
success
in
the
late
trial
of
courage
as
they
went
rapidly
up
the
street
the
little
boy
who
had
made
the
furtive
expedition
cried
out
confidently
from
the
rear
yes
and
i
went
almost
up
to
him
i
willie
the
large
boy
crushed
him
in
a
few
words
huh
he
scoffed
you
only
went
a
little
way
i
went
clear
up
to
him
the
pace
of
the
other
boys
was
so
manly
that
the
tiny
thing
had
to
trot
and
he
remained
at
the
rear
getting
entangled
in
their
legs
in
his
attempts
to
reach
the
front
rank
and
become
of
some
importance
dodging
this
way
and
that
way
and
always
piping
out
his
little
claim
to
glory
xxi
grace
said
trescott
looking
into
the
from
his
office
door
i
wish
you
would
send
jimmie
to
me
before
when
jimmie
came
he
advanced
so
quietly
that
trescott
did
not
at
first
note
him
oh
he
said
wheeling
from
a
cabinet
here
you
are
young
man
yes
sir
trescott
dropped
into
his
chair
and
tapped
the
desk
with
a
thoughtful
finger
jimmie
what
were
you
doing
in
the
back
garden
yesterday
you
and
the
other
boys
to
henry
we
were
doing
anything
trescott
looked
sternly
into
the
raised
eyes
of
his
son
are
you
sure
you
were
not
annoying
him
in
any
way
now
what
were
you
doing
exactly
why
we
why
we
now
willie
dalzel
said
i
dassent
go
right
up
to
him
and
i
did
and
then
he
did
and
then
the
other
boys
were
and
then
you
comed
trescott
groaned
deeply
his
countenance
was
so
clouded
in
sorrow
that
the
lad
bewildered
by
the
mystery
of
it
burst
suddenly
forth
in
dismal
lamentations
there
there
do
cry
jim
said
trescott
going
round
the
desk
only
he
sat
in
a
great
leather
and
took
the
boy
on
his
knee
only
i
want
to
explain
to
you
after
jimmie
had
gone
to
school
and
as
trescott
was
about
to
start
on
his
round
of
morning
calls
a
message
arrived
from
doctor
moser
it
set
forth
that
the
latter
sister
was
dying
in
the
old
homestead
twenty
miles
away
up
the
valley
and
asked
trescott
to
care
for
his
patients
for
the
day
at
least
there
was
also
in
the
envelope
a
little
history
of
each
case
and
of
what
had
already
been
done
trescott
replied
to
the
messenger
that
he
would
gladly
assent
to
the
arrangement
he
noted
that
the
first
name
on
moser
list
was
winter
but
this
did
not
seem
to
strike
him
as
an
important
fact
when
its
turn
came
he
rang
the
winter
bell
winter
he
said
cheerfully
as
the
door
was
opened
doctor
moser
has
been
obliged
to
leave
town
and
he
has
asked
me
to
come
in
his
stead
how
is
the
little
girl
this
morning
winter
had
regarded
him
in
stony
surprise
at
last
she
said
come
in
i
see
my
husband
she
bolted
into
the
house
trescott
entered
the
hall
and
turned
to
the
left
into
the
presently
winter
shuffled
through
the
door
his
eyes
flashed
towards
trescott
he
did
not
betray
any
desire
to
advance
far
into
the
room
what
do
you
want
he
said
what
do
i
want
what
do
i
want
repeated
trescott
lifting
his
head
suddenly
he
had
heard
an
utterly
new
challenge
in
the
night
of
the
jungle
yes
that
what
i
want
to
know
snapped
winter
what
do
you
want
trescott
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
consulted
moser
memoranda
i
see
that
your
little
girl
case
is
a
trifle
serious
he
remarked
i
would
advise
you
to
call
a
physician
soon
i
will
leave
you
a
copy
of
moser
record
to
give
to
any
one
you
may
call
he
paused
to
transcribe
the
record
on
a
page
of
his
tearing
out
the
leaf
he
extended
it
to
winter
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
the
latter
shrunk
against
the
wall
his
head
was
hanging
as
he
reached
for
the
paper
this
caused
him
to
grasp
air
and
so
trescott
simply
let
the
paper
flutter
to
the
feet
of
the
other
man
said
trescott
from
the
hall
this
placid
retreat
seemed
to
suddenly
arouse
winter
to
ferocity
it
was
as
if
he
had
then
recalled
all
the
truths
which
he
had
formulated
to
hurl
at
trescott
so
he
followed
him
into
the
hall
and
down
the
hall
to
the
door
and
through
the
door
to
the
porch
barking
in
fiery
rage
from
a
respectful
distance
as
trescott
imperturbably
turned
the
mare
head
down
the
road
winter
stood
on
the
porch
still
yelping
he
was
like
a
little
dog
xxii
have
you
heard
the
news
cried
carrie
dungen
as
she
sped
towards
martha
kitchen
have
you
heard
the
news
her
eyes
were
shining
with
delight
no
answered
martha
sister
kate
bending
forward
eagerly
what
was
it
what
was
it
carrie
appeared
triumphantly
in
the
open
door
oh
there
been
an
awful
scene
between
doctor
trescott
and
jake
winter
i
never
thought
that
jake
winter
had
any
pluck
at
all
but
this
morning
he
told
the
doctor
just
what
he
thought
of
him
well
what
did
he
think
of
him
asked
martha
oh
he
called
him
everything
howarth
heard
it
through
her
front
blinds
it
was
terrible
she
says
it
all
over
town
now
everybody
knows
it
did
the
doctor
answer
back
no
howarth
she
says
he
never
said
a
word
he
just
walked
down
to
his
buggy
and
got
in
and
drove
off
as
but
jake
gave
him
jinks
by
all
accounts
but
what
did
he
say
cried
kate
shrill
and
excited
she
was
evidently
at
some
kind
of
a
feast
oh
he
told
him
that
sadie
had
never
been
well
since
that
night
henry
johnson
frightened
her
at
theresa
page
party
and
he
held
him
responsible
and
how
dared
he
cross
his
threshold
and
and
and
and
what
said
martha
did
he
swear
at
him
said
kate
in
fearsome
glee
no
not
much
he
did
swear
at
him
a
little
but
not
more
than
a
man
does
anyhow
when
he
is
real
mad
howarth
says
breathed
kate
and
did
he
call
him
any
names
martha
at
her
work
had
been
for
a
time
in
deep
thought
she
now
interrupted
the
others
it
do
seem
as
if
sadie
winter
had
been
sick
since
that
time
henry
johnson
got
loose
she
been
to
school
almost
the
whole
time
since
then
has
she
they
combined
upon
her
in
immediate
indignation
school
school
i
should
say
not
do
think
for
a
moment
school
martha
wheeled
from
the
sink
she
held
an
iron
spoon
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
going
to
attack
them
sadie
winter
has
passed
here
many
a
morning
since
then
carrying
her
schoolbag
where
was
she
going
to
a
wedding
the
others
long
accustomed
to
a
mental
tyranny
speedily
surrendered
did
she
stammered
kate
i
never
saw
her
carrie
dungen
made
a
weak
gesture
if
i
had
been
doctor
trescott
exclaimed
martha
loudly
i
have
knocked
that
miserable
jake
winter
head
off
kate
and
carrie
exchanging
glances
made
an
alliance
in
the
air
i
do
see
why
you
say
that
martha
replied
carrie
with
considerable
boldness
gaining
support
and
sympathy
from
kate
smile
i
do
see
how
anybody
can
be
blamed
for
getting
angry
when
their
little
girl
gets
almost
scared
to
death
and
gets
sick
from
it
and
all
that
besides
everybody
says
oh
i
do
care
what
everybody
says
said
martha
well
you
ca
go
against
the
whole
town
answered
carrie
in
sudden
sharp
defiance
no
martha
you
ca
go
against
the
whole
town
piped
kate
following
her
leader
rapidly
whole
town
cried
martha
i
like
to
know
what
you
call
whole
town
do
you
call
these
silly
people
who
are
scared
of
henry
johnson
whole
town
why
martha
said
carrie
in
a
reasoning
tone
you
talk
as
if
you
would
be
scared
of
him
no
more
would
i
retorted
martha
martha
how
you
talk
said
kate
why
the
idea
afraid
of
him
carrie
was
grinning
you
never
seen
him
have
you
she
asked
seductively
no
admitted
martha
well
then
how
do
you
know
that
you
would
be
scared
martha
confronted
her
have
you
ever
seen
him
no
well
then
how
do
you
know
you
be
scared
the
allied
forces
broke
out
in
chorus
but
martha
everybody
says
so
everybody
says
so
everybody
says
what
everybody
that
seen
him
say
they
were
frightened
almost
to
death
tis
only
women
but
it
men
too
it
awful
martha
wagged
her
head
solemnly
i
try
not
to
be
afraid
of
him
but
supposing
you
could
not
help
it
said
kate
yes
and
look
here
cried
carrie
i
tell
you
another
thing
the
hannigans
are
going
to
move
out
of
the
house
next
door
on
account
of
him
demanded
martha
carrie
nodded
hannigan
says
so
herself
well
of
all
things
ejaculated
martha
going
to
move
eh
you
do
say
so
where
they
going
to
move
to
down
on
orchard
avenue
well
of
all
things
nice
house
i
do
know
about
that
i
have
heard
but
there
lots
of
nice
houses
on
orchard
yes
but
they
all
taken
said
kate
there
is
a
vacant
house
on
orchard
avenue
oh
yes
there
is
said
martha
the
old
hampstead
house
is
vacant
oh
of
course
said
kate
but
then
i
do
believe
hannigan
would
like
it
there
i
wonder
where
they
can
be
going
to
move
to
i
sure
i
do
know
sighed
martha
it
must
be
to
some
place
we
do
know
about
well
said
carrie
dungen
after
a
general
reflective
silence
easy
enough
to
find
out
anyhow
who
knows
around
here
asked
kate
why
smith
and
there
she
is
in
her
garden
said
carrie
jumping
to
her
feet
as
she
dashed
out
of
the
door
kate
and
martha
crowded
at
the
window
carrie
voice
rang
out
from
near
the
steps
smith
smith
do
you
know
where
the
hannigans
are
going
to
move
to
xxiii
the
autumn
smote
the
leaves
and
the
trees
of
whilomville
were
panoplied
in
crimson
and
yellow
the
winds
grew
stronger
and
in
the
melancholy
purple
of
the
nights
the
home
shine
of
a
window
became
a
finer
thing
the
little
boys
watching
the
sear
and
sorrowful
leaves
drifting
down
from
the
maples
dreamed
of
the
near
time
when
they
could
heap
bushels
in
the
streets
and
burn
them
during
the
abrupt
evenings
three
men
walked
down
the
niagara
avenue
as
they
approached
judge
hagenthorpe
house
he
came
down
his
walk
to
meet
them
in
the
manner
of
one
who
has
been
waiting
are
you
ready
judge
one
said
all
ready
he
answered
the
four
then
walked
to
trescott
house
he
received
them
in
his
office
where
he
had
been
reading
he
seemed
surprised
at
this
visit
of
four
very
active
and
influential
citizens
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
of
it
after
they
were
all
seated
trescott
looked
expectantly
from
one
face
to
another
there
was
a
little
silence
it
was
broken
by
john
twelve
the
wholesale
grocer
who
was
worth
and
reported
to
be
worth
over
a
million
well
doctor
he
said
with
a
short
laugh
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
admit
at
once
that
we
come
to
interfere
in
something
which
is
none
of
our
business
why
what
is
it
asked
trescott
again
looking
from
one
face
to
another
he
seemed
to
appeal
particularly
to
judge
hagenthorpe
but
the
old
man
had
his
chin
lowered
musingly
to
his
cane
and
would
not
look
at
him
it
about
what
nobody
talks
of
much
said
twelve
it
about
henry
johnson
trescott
squared
himself
in
his
chair
yes
he
said
having
delivered
himself
of
the
title
twelve
seemed
to
become
more
easy
yes
he
answered
blandly
we
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
it
yes
said
trescott
illustration
about
what
nobody
talks
of
much
said
twelve
twelve
abruptly
advanced
on
the
main
attack
now
see
here
trescott
we
like
you
and
we
have
come
to
talk
right
out
about
this
business
it
may
be
none
of
our
affairs
and
all
that
and
as
for
me
i
mind
if
you
tell
me
so
but
i
am
not
going
to
keep
quiet
and
see
you
ruin
yourself
and
that
how
we
all
feel
i
am
not
ruining
myself
answered
trescott
no
maybe
you
are
not
exactly
ruining
yourself
said
twelve
slowly
but
you
are
doing
yourself
a
great
deal
of
harm
you
have
changed
from
being
the
leading
doctor
in
town
to
about
the
last
one
it
is
mainly
because
there
are
always
a
large
number
of
people
who
are
very
thoughtless
fools
of
course
but
then
that
does
change
the
condition
a
man
who
had
not
heretofore
spoken
said
solemnly
it
the
women
well
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
resumed
twelve
even
if
there
are
a
lot
of
fools
in
the
world
we
ca
see
any
reason
why
you
should
ruin
yourself
by
opposing
them
you
ca
teach
them
anything
you
know
i
am
not
trying
to
teach
them
anything
trescott
smiled
wearily
i
it
is
a
matter
of
well
and
there
are
a
good
many
of
us
that
admire
you
for
it
immensely
interrupted
twelve
but
that
is
going
to
change
the
minds
of
all
those
ninnies
it
the
women
stated
the
advocate
of
this
view
again
well
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
said
twelve
we
want
you
to
get
out
of
this
trouble
and
strike
your
old
gait
again
you
are
simply
killing
your
practice
through
your
infernal
pigheadedness
now
this
thing
is
out
of
the
ordinary
but
there
must
be
ways
to
to
beat
the
game
somehow
you
see
so
we
talked
it
over
about
a
dozen
of
us
and
as
i
say
if
you
want
to
tell
us
to
mind
our
own
business
why
go
ahead
but
we
talked
it
over
and
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
to
do
is
to
get
johnson
a
place
somewhere
off
up
the
valley
and
trescott
wearily
gestured
you
do
know
my
friend
everybody
is
so
afraid
of
him
they
ca
even
give
him
good
care
nobody
can
attend
to
him
as
i
do
myself
but
i
have
a
little
farm
up
beyond
clarence
mountain
that
i
was
going
to
give
to
henry
cried
twelve
aggrieved
and
if
you
and
if
you
if
you
through
your
house
burning
down
or
anything
why
all
the
boys
were
prepared
to
take
him
right
off
your
hands
and
and
trescott
arose
and
went
to
the
window
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
they
sat
waiting
in
silence
when
he
returned
he
kept
his
face
in
the
shadow
no
john
twelve
he
said
it
ca
be
done
there
was
another
stillness
suddenly
a
man
stirred
on
his
chair
well
then
a
public
institution
he
began
no
said
trescott
public
institutions
are
all
very
good
but
he
is
not
going
to
one
in
the
background
of
the
group
old
judge
hagenthorpe
was
thoughtfully
smoothing
the
polished
ivory
head
of
his
cane
xxiv
trescott
loudly
stamped
the
snow
from
his
feet
and
shook
the
flakes
from
his
shoulders
when
he
entered
the
house
he
went
at
once
to
the
and
then
to
the
jimmie
was
there
reading
painfully
in
a
large
book
concerning
giraffes
and
tigers
and
crocodiles
where
is
your
mother
jimmie
asked
trescott
i
do
know
pa
answered
the
boy
i
think
she
is
trescott
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
but
there
came
no
answer
seeing
that
the
door
of
the
little
was
open
he
entered
the
room
was
bathed
in
the
that
came
from
the
four
dull
panes
of
mica
in
the
front
of
the
great
stove
as
his
eyes
grew
used
to
the
shadows
he
saw
his
wife
curled
in
an
he
went
to
her
why
grace
he
said
did
you
hear
me
calling
you
she
made
no
answer
and
as
he
bent
over
the
chair
he
heard
her
trying
to
smother
a
sob
in
the
cushion
grace
he
cried
you
crying
she
raised
her
face
i
got
a
headache
a
dreadful
headache
ned
a
headache
he
repeated
in
surprise
and
incredulity
he
pulled
a
chair
close
to
hers
later
as
he
cast
his
eye
over
the
zone
of
light
shed
by
the
dull
red
panes
he
saw
that
a
low
table
had
been
drawn
close
to
the
stove
and
that
it
was
burdened
with
many
small
cups
and
plates
of
uncut
he
remembered
that
the
day
was
wednesday
and
that
his
wife
received
on
wednesdays
who
was
here
gracie
he
asked
from
his
shoulder
there
came
a
mumble
mrs
twelve
was
she
um
he
said
why
did
anna
hagenthorpe
come
over
the
mumble
from
his
shoulder
continued
she
was
well
enough
glancing
down
at
the
cups
trescott
mechanically
counted
them
there
were
fifteen
of
them
there
there
he
said
do
cry
grace
do
cry
the
wind
was
whining
round
the
house
and
the
snow
beat
aslant
upon
the
windows
sometimes
the
coal
in
the
stove
settled
with
a
crumbling
sound
and
the
four
panes
of
mica
flashed
a
sudden
new
crimson
as
he
sat
holding
her
head
on
his
shoulder
trescott
found
himself
occasionally
trying
to
count
the
cups
there
were
fifteen
of
them
the
blue
hotel
i
the
palace
hotel
at
fort
romper
was
painted
a
light
blue
a
shade
that
is
on
the
legs
of
a
kind
of
heron
causing
the
bird
to
declare
its
position
against
any
background
the
palace
hotel
then
was
always
screaming
and
howling
in
a
way
that
made
the
dazzling
winter
landscape
of
nebraska
seem
only
a
gray
swampish
hush
it
stood
alone
on
the
prairie
and
when
the
snow
was
falling
the
town
two
hundred
yards
away
was
not
visible
but
when
the
traveller
alighted
at
the
railway
station
he
was
obliged
to
pass
the
palace
hotel
before
he
could
come
upon
the
company
of
low
clapboard
houses
which
composed
fort
romper
and
it
was
not
to
be
thought
that
any
traveller
could
pass
the
palace
hotel
without
looking
at
it
pat
scully
the
proprietor
had
proved
himself
a
master
of
strategy
when
he
chose
his
paints
it
is
true
that
on
clear
days
when
the
great
expresses
long
lines
of
swaying
pullmans
swept
through
fort
romper
passengers
were
overcome
at
the
sight
and
the
cult
that
knows
the
and
the
subdivisions
of
the
dark
greens
of
the
east
expressed
shame
pity
horror
in
a
laugh
but
to
the
citizens
of
this
prairie
town
and
to
the
people
who
would
naturally
stop
there
pat
scully
had
performed
a
feat
with
this
opulence
and
splendor
these
creeds
classes
egotisms
that
streamed
through
romper
on
the
rails
day
after
day
they
had
no
color
in
common
as
if
the
displayed
delights
of
such
a
blue
hotel
were
not
sufficiently
enticing
it
was
scully
habit
to
go
every
morning
and
evening
to
meet
the
leisurely
trains
that
stopped
at
romper
and
work
his
seductions
upon
any
man
that
he
might
see
wavering
gripsack
in
hand
one
morning
when
a
engine
dragged
its
long
string
of
freight
cars
and
its
one
passenger
coach
to
the
station
scully
performed
the
marvel
of
catching
three
men
one
was
a
shaky
and
swede
with
a
great
shining
cheap
valise
one
was
a
tall
bronzed
cowboy
who
was
on
his
way
to
a
ranch
near
the
dakota
line
one
was
a
little
silent
man
from
the
east
who
did
look
it
and
did
announce
it
scully
practically
made
them
prisoners
he
was
so
nimble
and
merry
and
kindly
that
each
probably
felt
it
would
be
the
height
of
brutality
to
try
to
escape
they
trudged
off
over
the
creaking
board
sidewalks
in
the
wake
of
the
eager
little
irishman
he
wore
a
heavy
fur
cap
squeezed
tightly
down
on
his
head
it
caused
his
two
red
ears
to
stick
out
stiffly
as
if
they
were
made
of
tin
at
last
scully
elaborately
with
boisterous
hospitality
conducted
them
through
the
portals
of
the
blue
hotel
the
room
which
they
entered
was
small
it
seemed
to
be
merely
a
proper
temple
for
an
enormous
stove
which
in
the
centre
was
humming
with
godlike
violence
at
various
points
on
its
surface
the
iron
had
become
luminous
and
glowed
yellow
from
the
heat
beside
the
stove
son
johnnie
was
playing
with
an
old
farmer
who
had
whiskers
both
gray
and
sandy
they
were
quarrelling
frequently
the
old
farmer
turned
his
face
towards
a
box
of
sawdust
colored
brown
from
tobacco
juice
that
was
behind
the
stove
and
spat
with
an
air
of
great
impatience
and
irritation
with
a
loud
flourish
of
words
scully
destroyed
the
game
of
cards
and
bustled
his
son
with
part
of
the
baggage
of
the
new
guests
he
himself
conducted
them
to
three
basins
of
the
coldest
water
in
the
world
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
burnished
themselves
with
this
water
until
it
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
a
metal
polish
the
swede
however
merely
dipped
his
fingers
gingerly
and
with
trepidation
it
was
notable
that
throughout
this
series
of
small
ceremonies
the
three
travellers
were
made
to
feel
that
scully
was
very
benevolent
he
was
conferring
great
favors
upon
them
he
handed
the
towel
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
air
of
philanthropic
impulse
afterwards
they
went
to
the
first
room
and
sitting
about
the
stove
listened
to
scully
officious
clamor
at
his
daughters
who
were
preparing
the
meal
they
reflected
in
the
silence
of
experienced
men
who
tread
carefully
amid
new
people
nevertheless
the
old
farmer
stationary
invincible
in
his
chair
near
the
warmest
part
of
the
stove
turned
his
face
from
the
sawdust
box
frequently
and
addressed
a
glowing
commonplace
to
the
strangers
usually
he
was
answered
in
short
but
adequate
sentences
by
either
the
cowboy
or
the
easterner
the
swede
said
nothing
he
seemed
to
be
occupied
in
making
furtive
estimates
of
each
man
in
the
room
one
might
have
thought
that
he
had
the
sense
of
silly
suspicion
which
comes
to
guilt
he
resembled
a
badly
frightened
man
later
at
dinner
he
spoke
a
little
addressing
his
conversation
entirely
to
scully
he
volunteered
that
he
had
come
from
new
york
where
for
ten
years
he
had
worked
as
a
tailor
these
facts
seemed
to
strike
scully
as
fascinating
and
afterwards
he
volunteered
that
he
had
lived
at
romper
for
fourteen
years
the
swede
asked
about
the
crops
and
the
price
of
labor
he
seemed
barely
to
listen
to
extended
replies
his
eyes
continued
to
rove
from
man
to
man
finally
with
a
laugh
and
a
wink
he
said
that
some
of
these
western
communities
were
very
dangerous
and
after
his
statement
he
straightened
his
legs
under
the
table
tilted
his
head
and
laughed
again
loudly
it
was
plain
that
the
demonstration
had
no
meaning
to
the
others
they
looked
at
him
wondering
and
in
silence
ii
as
the
men
trooped
heavily
back
into
the
the
two
little
windows
presented
views
of
a
turmoiling
sea
of
snow
the
huge
arms
of
the
wind
were
making
attempts
mighty
circular
futile
to
embrace
the
flakes
as
they
sped
a
like
a
still
man
with
a
blanched
face
stood
aghast
amid
this
profligate
fury
in
a
hearty
voice
scully
announced
the
presence
of
a
blizzard
the
guests
of
the
blue
hotel
lighting
their
pipes
assented
with
grunts
of
lazy
masculine
contentment
no
island
of
the
sea
could
be
exempt
in
the
degree
of
this
little
room
with
its
humming
stove
johnnie
son
of
scully
in
a
tone
which
defined
his
opinion
of
his
ability
as
a
challenged
the
old
farmer
of
both
gray
and
sandy
whiskers
to
a
game
of
the
farmer
agreed
with
a
contemptuous
and
bitter
scoff
they
sat
close
to
the
stove
and
squared
their
knees
under
a
wide
board
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
watched
the
game
with
interest
the
swede
remained
near
the
window
aloof
but
with
a
countenance
that
showed
signs
of
an
inexplicable
excitement
the
play
of
johnnie
and
the
was
suddenly
ended
by
another
quarrel
the
old
man
arose
while
casting
a
look
of
heated
scorn
at
his
adversary
he
slowly
buttoned
his
coat
and
then
stalked
with
fabulous
dignity
from
the
room
in
the
discreet
silence
of
all
other
men
the
swede
laughed
his
laughter
rang
somehow
childish
men
by
this
time
had
begun
to
look
at
him
askance
as
if
they
wished
to
inquire
what
ailed
him
a
new
game
was
formed
jocosely
the
cowboy
volunteered
to
become
the
partner
of
johnnie
and
they
all
then
turned
to
ask
the
swede
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
the
little
easterner
he
asked
some
questions
about
the
game
and
learning
that
it
wore
many
names
and
that
he
had
played
it
when
it
was
under
an
alias
he
accepted
the
invitation
he
strode
towards
the
men
nervously
as
if
he
expected
to
be
assaulted
finally
seated
he
gazed
from
face
to
face
and
laughed
shrilly
this
laugh
was
so
strange
that
the
easterner
looked
up
quickly
the
cowboy
sat
intent
and
with
his
mouth
open
and
johnnie
paused
holding
the
cards
with
still
fingers
afterwards
there
was
a
short
silence
then
johnnie
said
well
get
at
it
come
on
now
they
pulled
their
chairs
forward
until
their
knees
were
bunched
under
the
board
they
began
to
play
and
their
interest
in
the
game
caused
the
others
to
forget
the
manner
of
the
swede
the
cowboy
was
a
each
time
that
he
held
superior
cards
he
whanged
them
one
by
one
with
exceeding
force
down
upon
the
improvised
table
and
took
the
tricks
with
a
glowing
air
of
prowess
and
pride
that
sent
thrills
of
indignation
into
the
hearts
of
his
opponents
a
game
with
a
in
it
is
sure
to
become
intense
the
countenances
of
the
easterner
and
the
swede
were
miserable
whenever
the
cowboy
thundered
down
his
aces
and
kings
while
johnnie
his
eyes
gleaming
with
joy
chuckled
and
chuckled
because
of
the
absorbing
play
none
considered
the
strange
ways
of
the
swede
they
paid
strict
heed
to
the
game
finally
during
a
lull
caused
by
a
new
deal
the
swede
suddenly
addressed
johnnie
i
suppose
there
have
been
a
good
many
men
killed
in
this
room
the
jaws
of
the
others
dropped
and
they
looked
at
him
what
in
hell
are
you
talking
about
said
johnnie
the
swede
laughed
again
his
blatant
laugh
full
of
a
kind
of
false
courage
and
defiance
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
all
right
he
answered
i
a
liar
if
i
do
johnnie
protested
the
card
was
halted
and
the
men
stared
at
the
swede
johnnie
evidently
felt
that
as
the
son
of
the
proprietor
he
should
make
a
direct
inquiry
now
what
might
you
be
drivin
at
mister
he
asked
the
swede
winked
at
him
it
was
a
wink
full
of
cunning
his
fingers
shook
on
the
edge
of
the
board
oh
maybe
you
think
i
have
been
to
nowheres
maybe
you
think
i
a
tenderfoot
i
do
know
nothin
about
you
answered
johnnie
and
i
do
give
a
damn
where
you
been
all
i
got
to
say
is
that
i
do
know
what
you
driving
at
there
hai
never
been
nobody
killed
in
this
room
the
cowboy
who
had
been
steadily
gazing
at
the
swede
then
spoke
what
wrong
with
you
mister
apparently
it
seemed
to
the
swede
that
he
was
formidably
menaced
he
shivered
and
turned
white
near
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
sent
an
appealing
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
little
easterner
during
these
moments
he
did
not
forget
to
wear
his
air
of
advanced
they
say
they
do
know
what
i
mean
he
remarked
mockingly
to
the
easterner
the
latter
answered
after
prolonged
and
cautious
reflection
i
understand
you
he
said
impassively
the
swede
made
a
movement
then
which
announced
that
he
thought
he
had
encountered
treachery
from
the
only
quarter
where
he
had
expected
sympathy
if
not
help
oh
i
see
you
are
all
against
me
i
see
the
cowboy
was
in
a
state
of
deep
stupefaction
say
he
cried
as
he
tumbled
the
deck
violently
down
upon
the
board
say
what
are
you
gittin
at
hey
the
swede
sprang
up
with
the
celerity
of
a
man
escaping
from
a
snake
on
the
floor
i
do
want
to
fight
he
shouted
i
do
want
to
fight
the
cowboy
stretched
his
long
legs
indolently
and
deliberately
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
he
spat
into
the
sawdust
box
well
who
the
hell
thought
you
did
he
inquired
the
swede
backed
rapidly
towards
a
corner
of
the
room
his
hands
were
out
protectingly
in
front
of
his
chest
but
he
was
making
an
obvious
struggle
to
control
his
fright
gentlemen
he
quavered
i
suppose
i
am
going
to
be
killed
before
i
can
leave
this
house
i
suppose
i
am
going
to
be
killed
before
i
can
leave
this
house
in
his
eyes
was
the
look
through
the
windows
could
be
seen
the
snow
turning
blue
in
the
shadow
of
dusk
the
wind
tore
at
the
house
and
some
loose
thing
beat
regularly
against
the
like
a
spirit
tapping
a
door
opened
and
scully
himself
entered
he
paused
in
surprise
as
he
noted
the
tragic
attitude
of
the
swede
then
he
said
what
the
matter
here
the
swede
answered
him
swiftly
and
eagerly
these
men
are
going
to
kill
me
kill
you
ejaculated
scully
kill
you
what
are
you
talkin
the
swede
made
the
gesture
of
a
martyr
scully
wheeled
sternly
upon
his
son
what
is
this
johnnie
the
lad
had
grown
sullen
damned
if
i
know
he
answered
i
make
no
sense
to
it
he
began
to
shuffle
the
cards
fluttering
them
together
with
an
angry
snap
he
says
a
good
many
men
have
been
killed
in
this
room
or
something
like
that
and
he
says
he

to
be
killed
here
too
i
do
know
what
ails
him
he
crazy
i
wonder
scully
then
looked
for
explanation
to
the
cowboy
but
the
cowboy
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders

said
scully
again
to
the
swede

sort
of
sweat
of
misery
and
terror
upon
his
face
i
know
i
wo

out
of
here
alive
the
cowboy
drew
a
deep
breath
as
if
his
mind
was
passing
into
the
last
stages
of
dissolution
well
i
he
whispered
to
himself
scully
wheeled
suddenly
and
faced
his
son

johnnie
voice
was
loud
with
its

of

cast
a
terrible
eye
upon
johnnie
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
never
mind
scully
never
mind
i
will
go
away
i
do
not
wish
to

the
swede
moved
towards
the
door
which
opened
upon
the
stairs
it
was
evidently
his
intention
to
go
at
once
for
his
baggage
no
no
shouted
scully
peremptorily
but
the
man
slid
by
him
and
disappeared
now
said
scully
severely
what

this
mane
johnnie
and
the
cowboy
cried
together
why
we
did
do
nothin
to
scully
eyes
were
cold
no
he
said
you

johnnie
swore
a
deep
oath
why

the
wildest
loon
i
ever

do
nothin
at

we
were
jest
sittin

and
he
the
father
suddenly
spoke
to
the
easterner
blanc
he
asked
what
has
these
boys
been
doin
the
easterner
reflected
again
i
did
see
anything
wrong
at
all
he
said
at
last
slowly
scully
began
to
howl
but
what
does
it
mane
he
stared
ferociously
at
his
son
i
have
a
mind
to
lather
you
for
this
me
boy
johnnie
was
frantic
well
what

he
bawled
at
his
father
iii
i
think
you
are
said
scully
finally
to
his
son
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
and
at
the
end
of
this
scornful
sentence
he
left
the
room
the
swede
was
swiftly
fastening
the
straps
of
his
great
valise
once
his
back
happened
to
be
half
turned
towards
the
door
and
hearing
a
noise
there
he
wheeled
and
sprang
up
uttering
a
loud
cry
scully
wrinkled
visage
showed
grimly
in
the
light
of
the
small
lamp
he
carried
this
yellow
effulgence
streaming
upward
colored
only
his
prominent
features
and
left
his
eyes
for
instance
in
mysterious
shadow
he
resembled
a
murderer
man
man
he
exclaimed
have
you
gone
daffy
oh
no
oh
no
rejoined
the
other
there
are
people
in
this
world
who
know
pretty
nearly
as
much
as
you
do
understand
for
a
moment
they
stood
gazing
at
each
other
upon
the
swede
deathly
pale
checks
were
two
spots
brightly
crimson
and
sharply
edged
as
if
they
had
been
carefully
painted
scully
placed
the
light
on
the
table
and
sat
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
spoke
ruminatively
by
cracky
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
it
a
complete
muddle
i
ca
for
the
soul
of
me
think
how
you
ever
got
this
idea
into
your
head
presently
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
asked
and
did
you
sure
think
they
were
going
to
kill
you
the
swede
scanned
the
old
man
as
if
he
wished
to
see
into
his
mind
i
did
he
said
at
last
he
obviously
suspected
that
this
answer
might
precipitate
an
outbreak
as
he
pulled
on
a
strap
his
whole
arm
shook
the
elbow
wavering
like
a
bit
of
paper
scully
banged
his
hand
impressively
on
the
of
the
bed
why
man
we
goin
to
have
a
line
of
ilictric
in
this
town
next
spring
line
of
electric
repeated
the
swede
stupidly
and
said
scully
there
a
new
railroad
goin
to
be
built
down
from
broken
arm
to
here
not
to
mintion
the
four
churches
and
the
smashin
big
brick
then
there
the
big
factory
too
why
in
two
years
romper
be
a
having
finished
the
preparation
of
his
baggage
the
swede
straightened
himself
scully
he
said
with
sudden
hardihood
how
much
do
i
owe
you
you
do
owe
me
anythin
said
the
old
man
angrily
yes
i
do
retorted
the
swede
he
took
cents
from
his
pocket
and
tendered
it
to
scully
but
the
latter
snapped
his
fingers
in
disdainful
refusal
however
it
happened
that
they
both
stood
gazing
in
a
strange
fashion
at
three
silver
pieces
on
the
swede
open
palm
i
not
take
your
money
said
scully
at
last
not
after
been
goin
on
here
then
a
plan
seemed
to
strike
him
here
he
cried
picking
up
his
lamp
and
moving
towards
the
door
here
come
with
me
a
minute
no
said
the
swede
in
overwhelming
alarm
yes
urged
the
old
man

on
i
want
you
to
come
and
see
a
picter
just
across
the
hall
in
my
room
the
swede
must
have
concluded
that
his
hour
was
come
his
jaw
dropped
and
his
teeth
showed
like
a
dead
man
he
ultimately
followed
scully
across
the
corridor
but
he
had
the
step
of
one
hung
in
chains
scully
flashed
the
light
high
on
the
wall
of
his
own
chamber
there
was
revealed
a
ridiculous
photograph
of
a
little
girl
she
was
leaning
against
a
balustrade
of
gorgeous
decoration
and
the
formidable
bang
to
her
hair
was
prominent
the
figure
was
as
graceful
as
an
upright
and
withal
it
was
of
the
hue
of
lead
there
said
scully
tenderly
that
the
picter
of
my
little
girl
that
died
her
name
was
carrie
she
had
the
purtiest
hair
you
ever
saw
i
was
that
fond
of
her
she
turning
then
he
saw
that
the
swede
was
not
contemplating
the
picture
at
all
but
instead
was
keeping
keen
watch
on
the
gloom
in
the
rear
look
man
cried
scully
heartily
that
the
picter
of
my
little
gal
that
died
her
name
was
carrie
and
then
here
the
picter
of
my
oldest
boy
michael
he
a
lawyer
in
lincoln
an
doin
well
i
gave
that
boy
a
grand
eddycation
and
i
glad
for
it
now
he
a
fine
boy
look
at
now
ai
he
bold
as
blazes
him
there
in
lincoln
an
honored
an
respicted
gintleman
an
honored
an
respicted
gintleman
concluded
scully
with
a
flourish
and
so
saying
he
smote
the
swede
jovially
on
the
back
the
swede
faintly
smiled
now
said
the
old
man
there
only
one
more
thing
he
dropped
suddenly
to
the
floor
and
thrust
his
head
beneath
the
bed
the
swede
could
hear
his
muffled
voice
i
keep
it
under
me
piller
if
it
was
for
that
boy
johnnie
then
there
the
old
woman
where
is
it
now
i
never
put
it
twice
in
the
same
place
ah
now
come
out
with
you
presently
he
backed
clumsily
from
under
the
bed
dragging
with
him
an
old
coat
rolled
into
a
bundle
i
fetched
him
he
muttered
kneeling
on
the
floor
he
unrolled
the
coat
and
extracted
from
its
heart
a
large
whiskey
bottle
his
first
maneuver
was
to
hold
the
bottle
up
to
the
light
reassured
apparently
that
nobody
had
been
tampering
with
it
he
thrust
it
with
a
generous
movement
towards
the
swede
the
swede
was
about
to
eagerly
clutch
this
element
of
strength
but
he
suddenly
jerked
his
hand
away
and
cast
a
look
of
horror
upon
scully
drink
said
the
old
man
affectionately
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
now
stood
facing
the
swede
there
was
a
silence
then
again
scully
said
drink
the
swede
laughed
wildly
he
grabbed
the
bottle
put
it
to
his
mouth
and
as
his
lips
curled
absurdly
around
the
opening
and
his
throat
worked
he
kept
his
glance
burning
with
hatred
upon
the
old
face
iv
after
the
departure
of
scully
the
three
men
with
the
still
upon
their
knees
preserved
for
a
long
time
an
astounded
silence
then
johnnie
said
that
the
swede
i
ever
see
he
ai
no
swede
said
the
cowboy
scornfully
well
what
is
he
then
cried
johnnie
what
is
he
then
it
my
opinion
replied
the
cowboy
deliberately
he
some
kind
of
a
dutchman
it
was
a
venerable
custom
of
the
country
to
entitle
as
swedes
all
men
who
spoke
with
a
heavy
tongue
in
consequence
the
idea
of
the
cowboy
was
not
without
its
daring
yes
sir
he
repeated
it
my
opinion
this
feller
is
some
kind
of
a
dutchman
well
he
says
he
a
swede
anyhow
muttered
johnnie
sulkily
he
turned
to
the
easterner
what
do
you
think
mr
blanc
oh
i
do
know
replied
the
easterner
well
what
do
you
think
makes
him
act
that
way
asked
the
cowboy
why
he
frightened
the
easterner
knocked
his
pipe
against
a
rim
of
the
stove
he
clear
frightened
out
of
his
boots
what
at
cried
johnnie
and
cowboy
together
the
easterner
reflected
over
his
answer
what
at
cried
the
others
again
oh
i
do
know
but
it
seems
to
me
this
man
has
been
reading
and
he
thinks
he
right
out
in
the
middle
of
it
the
shootin
and
stabbin
and
all
but
said
the
cowboy
deeply
scandalized
this
ai
wyoming
ner
none
of
them
places
this
is
nebrasker
yes
added
johnnie
an
why
do
he
wait
till
he
gits
west
the
travelled
easterner
laughed
it
is
different
there
even
not
in
these
days
but
he
thinks
he
right
in
the
middle
of
hell
johnnie
and
the
cowboy
mused
long
it
awful
funny
remarked
johnnie
at
last
yes
said
the
cowboy
this
is
a
queer
game
i
hope
we
do
git
snowed
in
because
then
we
have
to
stand
this
here
man
bein
around
with
us
all
the
time
that
would
be
no
good
i
wish
pop
would
throw
him
out
said
johnnie
presently
they
heard
a
loud
stamping
on
the
stairs
accompanied
by
ringing
jokes
in
the
voice
of
old
scully
and
laughter
evidently
from
the
swede
the
men
around
the
stove
stared
vacantly
at
each
other
gosh
said
the
cowboy
the
door
flew
open
and
old
scully
flushed
and
anecdotal
came
into
the
room
he
was
jabbering
at
the
swede
who
followed
him
laughing
bravely
it
was
the
entry
of
two
roisterers
from
a
come
now
said
scully
sharply
to
the
three
seated
men
move
up
and
give
us
a
chance
at
the
stove
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
obediently
sidled
their
chairs
to
make
room
for
the
johnnie
however
simply
arranged
himself
in
a
more
indolent
attitude
and
then
remained
motionless
come
git
over
there
said
scully
plenty
of
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
said
johnnie
do
you
think
we
want
to
sit
in
the
draught
roared
the
father
but
the
swede
here
interposed
with
a
grandeur
of
confidence
no
no
let
the
boy
sit
where
he
likes
he
cried
in
a
bullying
voice
to
the
father
all
right
all
right
said
scully
deferentially
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
exchanged
glances
of
wonder
the
five
chairs
were
formed
in
a
crescent
about
one
side
of
the
stove
the
swede
began
to
talk
he
talked
arrogantly
profanely
angrily
johnnie
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
maintained
a
morose
silence
while
old
scully
appeared
to
be
receptive
and
eager
breaking
in
constantly
with
sympathetic
ejaculations
finally
the
swede
announced
that
he
was
thirsty
he
moved
in
his
chair
and
said
that
he
would
go
for
a
drink
of
water
i
git
it
for
you
cried
scully
at
once
no
said
the
swede
contemptuously
i
get
it
for
myself
he
arose
and
stalked
with
the
air
of
an
owner
off
into
the
executive
parts
of
the
hotel
as
soon
as
the
swede
was
out
of
hearing
scully
sprang
to
his
feet
and
whispered
intensely
to
the
others
he
thought
i
was
to
poison
say
said
johnnie
this
makes
me
sick
why
do
you
throw
out
in
the
snow
why
he
all
right
now
declared
scully
it
was
only
that
he
was
from
the
east
and
he
thought
this
was
a
tough
place
that
all
all
right
now
the
cowboy
looked
with
admiration
upon
the
easterner
you
were
straight
he
said
you
were
on
to
that
there
dutchman
well
said
johnnie
to
his
father
he
may
be
all
right
now
but
i
do
see
it
other
time
he
was
scared
but
now
he
too
fresh
scully
speech
was
always
a
combination
of
irish
brogue
and
idiom
western
twang
and
idiom
and
scraps
of
curiously
formal
diction
taken
from
the
and
newspapers
he
now
hurled
a
strange
mass
of
language
at
the
head
of
his
son
what
do
i
keep
what
do
i
keep
what
do
i
keep
he
demanded
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
slapped
his
knee
impressively
to
indicate
that
he
himself
was
going
to
make
reply
and
that
all
should
heed
i
keep
a
hotel
he
shouted
a
hotel
do
you
mind
a
guest
under
my
roof
has
sacred
privileges
he
is
to
be
intimidated
by
none
not
one
word
shall
he
hear
that
would
prejudice
him
in
favor
of
goin
away
i
not
have
it
there
no
place
in
this
here
town
where
they
can
say
they
iver
took
in
a
guest
of
mine
because
he
was
afraid
to
stay
here
he
wheeled
suddenly
upon
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
am
i
right
yes
scully
said
the
cowboy
i
think
you
right
yes
scully
said
the
easterner
i
think
you
right
v
at
supper
the
swede
fizzed
like
a
he
sometimes
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
riotous
song
and
in
all
his
madness
he
was
encouraged
by
old
scully
the
easterner
was
incased
in
reserve
the
cowboy
sat
in
amazement
forgetting
to
eat
while
johnnie
wrathily
demolished
great
plates
of
food
the
daughters
of
the
house
when
they
were
obliged
to
replenish
the
biscuits
approached
as
warily
as
indians
and
having
succeeded
in
their
purpose
fled
with
trepidation
the
swede
domineered
the
whole
feast
and
he
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
cruel
bacchanal
he
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
taller
he
gazed
brutally
disdainful
into
every
face
his
voice
rang
through
the
room
once
when
he
jabbed
out
with
his
fork
to
pinion
a
biscuit
the
weapon
nearly
impaled
the
hand
of
the
easterner
which
had
been
stretched
quietly
out
for
the
same
biscuit
after
supper
as
the
men
filed
towards
the
other
room
the
swede
smote
scully
ruthlessly
on
the
shoulder
well
old
boy
that
was
a
good
square
meal
johnnie
looked
hopefully
at
his
father
he
knew
that
shoulder
was
tender
from
an
old
fall
and
indeed
it
appeared
for
a
moment
as
if
scully
was
going
to
flame
out
over
the
matter
but
in
the
end
he
smiled
a
sickly
smile
and
remained
silent
the
others
understood
from
his
manner
that
he
was
admitting
his
responsibility
for
the
swede
new
johnnie
however
addressed
his
parent
in
an
aside
why
do
you
license
somebody
to
kick
you
scully
scowled
darkly
by
way
of
reply
when
they
were
gathered
about
the
stove
the
swede
insisted
on
another
game
of
high
five
scully
gently
deprecated
the
plan
at
first
but
the
swede
turned
a
wolfish
glare
upon
him
the
old
man
subsided
and
the
swede
canvassed
the
others
in
his
tone
there
was
always
a
great
threat
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
both
remarked
indifferently
that
they
would
play
scully
said
that
he
would
presently
have
to
go
to
meet
the
train
and
so
the
swede
turned
menacingly
upon
johnnie
for
a
moment
their
glances
crossed
like
blades
and
then
johnnie
smiled
and
said
yes
i
play
they
formed
a
square
with
the
little
board
on
their
knees
the
easterner
and
the
swede
were
again
partners
as
the
play
went
on
it
was
noticeable
that
the
cowboy
was
not
as
usual
meanwhile
scully
near
the
lamp
had
put
on
his
spectacles
and
with
an
appearance
curiously
like
an
old
priest
was
reading
a
newspaper
in
time
he
went
out
to
meet
the
train
and
despite
his
precautions
a
gust
of
polar
wind
whirled
into
the
room
as
he
opened
the
door
besides
scattering
the
cards
it
dulled
the
players
to
the
marrow
the
swede
cursed
frightfully
when
scully
returned
his
entrance
disturbed
a
cosey
and
friendly
scene
the
swede
again
cursed
but
presently
they
were
once
more
intent
their
heads
bent
forward
and
their
hands
moving
swiftly
the
swede
had
adopted
the
fashion
of
scully
took
up
his
paper
and
for
a
long
time
remained
immersed
in
matters
which
were
extraordinarily
remote
from
him
the
lamp
burned
badly
and
once
he
stopped
to
adjust
the
wick
the
newspaper
as
he
turned
from
page
to
page
rustled
with
a
slow
and
comfortable
sound
then
suddenly
he
heard
three
terrible
words
you
are
cheatin
such
scenes
often
prove
that
there
can
be
little
of
dramatic
import
in
environment
any
room
can
present
a
tragic
front
any
room
can
be
comic
this
little
den
was
now
hideous
as
a
the
new
faces
of
the
men
themselves
had
changed
it
upon
the
instant
the
swede
held
a
huge
fist
in
front
of
johnnie
face
while
the
latter
looked
steadily
over
it
into
the
blazing
orbs
of
his
accuser
the
easterner
had
grown
pallid
the
cowboy
jaw
had
dropped
in
that
expression
of
bovine
amazement
which
was
one
of
his
important
mannerisms
after
the
three
words
the
first
sound
in
the
room
was
made
by
scully
paper
as
it
floated
forgotten
to
his
feet
his
spectacles
had
also
fallen
from
his
nose
but
by
a
clutch
he
had
saved
them
in
air
his
hand
grasping
the
spectacles
now
remained
poised
awkwardly
and
near
his
shoulder
he
stared
at
the
probably
the
silence
was
while
a
second
elapsed
then
if
the
floor
had
been
suddenly
twitched
out
from
under
the
men
they
could
not
have
moved
quicker
the
five
had
projected
themselves
headlong
towards
a
common
point
it
happened
that
johnnie
in
rising
to
hurl
himself
upon
the
swede
had
stumbled
slightly
because
of
his
curiously
instinctive
care
for
the
cards
and
the
board
the
loss
of
the
moment
allowed
time
for
the
arrival
of
scully
and
also
allowed
the
cowboy
time
to
give
the
swede
a
great
push
which
sent
him
staggering
back
the
men
found
tongue
together
and
hoarse
shouts
of
rage
appeal
or
fear
burst
from
every
throat
the
cowboy
pushed
and
jostled
feverishly
at
the
swede
and
the
easterner
and
scully
clung
wildly
to
johnnie
but
through
the
smoky
air
above
the
swaying
bodies
of
the
the
eyes
of
the
two
warriors
ever
sought
each
other
in
glances
of
challenge
that
were
at
once
hot
and
steely
of
course
the
board
had
been
overturned
and
now
the
whole
company
of
cards
was
scattered
over
the
floor
where
the
boots
of
the
men
trampled
the
fat
and
painted
kings
and
queens
as
they
gazed
with
their
silly
eyes
at
the
war
that
was
waging
above
them
scully
voice
was
dominating
the
yells
stop
now
stop
i
say
stop
now
johnnie
as
he
struggled
to
burst
through
the
rank
formed
by
scully
and
the
easterner
was
crying
well
he
says
i
cheated
he
says
i
cheated
i
wo
allow
no
man
to
say
i
cheated
if
he
says
i
cheated
he
a
the
cowboy
was
telling
the
swede
quit
now
quit
d
hear
the
screams
of
the
swede
never
ceased
he
did
cheat
i
saw
him
i
saw
him
as
for
the
easterner
he
was
importuning
in
a
voice
that
was
not
heeded
wait
a
moment
ca
you
oh
wait
a
moment
what
the
good
of
a
fight
over
a
game
of
cards
wait
a
moment
in
this
tumult
no
complete
sentences
were
clear
cheat
quit
he
says
these
fragments
pierced
the
uproar
and
rang
out
sharply
it
was
remarkable
that
whereas
scully
undoubtedly
made
the
most
noise
he
was
the
least
heard
of
any
of
the
riotous
band
then
suddenly
there
was
a
great
cessation
it
was
as
if
each
man
had
paused
for
breath
and
although
the
room
was
still
lighted
with
the
anger
of
men
it
could
be
seen
that
there
was
no
danger
of
immediate
conflict
and
at
once
johnnie
shouldering
his
way
forward
almost
succeeded
in
confronting
the
swede
what
did
you
say
i
cheated
for
what
did
you
say
i
cheated
for
i
do
cheat
and
i
wo
let
no
man
say
i
do
the
swede
said
i
saw
you
i
saw
you
well
cried
johnnie
i
fight
any
man
what
says
i
cheat
no
you
wo
said
the
cowboy
not
here
ah
be
still
ca
you
said
scully
coming
between
them
the
quiet
was
sufficient
to
allow
the
easterner
voice
to
be
heard
he
was
repealing
oh
wait
a
moment
ca
you
what
the
good
of
a
fight
over
a
game
of
cards
wait
a
moment
johnnie
his
red
face
appearing
above
his
father
shoulder
hailed
the
swede
again
did
you
say

well
let
go
at
it
then
mister
said
johnnie
coolly
the
cowboy
brow
was
beaded
with
sweat
from
his
efforts
in
intercepting
all
sorts
of
raids
he
turned
in
despair
to
scully
what
are
you
goin
to
do
now
a
change
had
come
over
the
celtic
visage
of
the
old
man
he
now
seemed
all
eagerness
his
eyes
glowed
we
let
them
fight
he
answered
stalwartly
i
ca
put
up
with
it
any
longer
i
stood
this
damned
swede
till
i
sick
we
let
them
fight
vi
the
men
prepared
to
go
the
easterner
was
so
nervous
that
he
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
new
leather
coat
as
the
cowboy
drew
his
fur
cap
down
over
his
cars
his
hands
trembled
in
fact
johnnie
and
old
scully
were
the
only
ones
who
displayed
no
agitation
these
preliminaries
were
conducted
without
words
scully
threw
open
the
door
well
come
on
he
said
instantly
a
terrific
wind
caused
the
flame
of
the
lamp
to
struggle
at
its
wick
while
a
puff
of
black
smoke
sprang
from
the
the
stove
was
in
of
the
blast
and
its
voice
swelled
to
equal
the
roar
of
the
storm
some
of
the
scarred
and
bedabbled
cards
were
caught
up
from
the
floor
and
dashed
helplessly
against
the
farther
wall
the
men
lowered
their
heads
and
plunged
into
the
tempest
as
into
a
sea
no
snow
was
falling
but
great
whirls
and
clouds
of
flakes
swept
up
from
the
ground
by
the
frantic
winds
were
streaming
southward
with
the
speed
of
bullets
the
covered
land
was
blue
with
the
sheen
of
an
unearthly
satin
and
there
was
no
other
hue
save
where
at
the
low
black
railway
station
which
seemed
incredibly
distant
one
light
gleamed
like
a
tiny
jewel
as
the
men
floundered
into
a
thigh
deep
drift
it
was
known
that
the
swede
was
bawling
out
something
scully
went
to
him
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
projected
an
ear
that
you
say
he
shouted
i
say
bawled
the
swede
again
i
wo
stand
much
show
against
this
gang
i
know
you
all
pitch
on
me
scully
smote
him
reproachfully
on
the
arm
tut
man
he
yelled
the
wind
tore
the
words
from
scully
lips
and
scattered
them
far
alee
you
are
all
a
gang
of
boomed
the
swede
but
the
storm
also
seized
the
remainder
of
this
sentence
immediately
turning
their
backs
upon
the
wind
the
men
had
swung
around
a
corner
to
the
sheltered
side
of
the
hotel
it
was
the
function
of
the
little
house
to
preserve
here
amid
this
great
devastation
of
snow
an
irregular
of
heavily
incrusted
grass
which
crackled
beneath
the
feet
one
could
imagine
the
great
drifts
piled
against
the
windward
side
when
the
party
reached
the
comparative
peace
of
this
spot
it
was
found
that
the
swede
was
still
bellowing
oh
i
know
what
kind
of
a
thing
this
is
i
know
you
all
pitch
on
me
i
ca
lick
you
all
scully
turned
upon
him
panther
fashion
you
not
have
to
whip
all
of
us
you
have
to
whip
my
son
johnnie
an
the
man
what
troubles
you
durin
that
time
will
have
me
to
dale
with
the
arrangements
were
swiftly
made
the
two
men
faced
each
other
obedient
to
the
harsh
commands
of
scully
whose
face
in
the
subtly
luminous
gloom
could
be
seen
set
in
the
austere
impersonal
lines
that
are
pictured
on
the
countenances
of
the
roman
veterans
the
easterner
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
was
hopping
up
and
down
like
a
mechanical
toy
the
cowboy
stood
the
contestants
had
not
stripped
off
any
clothing
each
was
in
his
ordinary
attire
their
fists
were
up
and
they
eyed
each
other
in
a
calm
that
had
the
elements
of
leonine
cruelty
in
it
during
this
pause
the
easterner
mind
like
a
film
took
lasting
impressions
of
three
men
the
master
of
the
ceremony
the
swede
pale
motionless
terrible
and
johnnie
serene
yet
ferocious
brutish
yet
heroic
the
entire
prelude
had
in
it
a
tragedy
greater
than
the
tragedy
of
action
and
this
aspect
was
accentuated
by
the
long
mellow
cry
of
the
blizzard
as
it
sped
the
tumbling
and
wailing
flakes
into
the
black
abyss
of
the
south
now
said
scully
the
two
combatants
leaped
forward
and
crashed
together
like
bullocks
there
was
heard
the
cushioned
sound
of
blows
and
of
a
curse
squeezing
out
from
between
the
tight
teeth
of
one
as
for
the
spectators
the
easterner
breath
exploded
from
him
with
a
pop
of
relief
absolute
relief
from
the
tension
of
the
preliminaries
the
cowboy
bounded
into
the
air
with
a
yowl
scully
was
immovable
as
from
supreme
amazement
and
fear
at
the
fury
of
the
fight
which
he
himself
had
permitted
and
arranged
for
a
time
the
encounter
in
the
darkness
was
such
a
perplexity
of
flying
arms
that
it
presented
no
more
detail
than
would
a
swiftly
revolving
wheel
occasionally
a
face
as
if
illumined
by
a
flash
of
light
would
shine
out
ghastly
and
marked
with
pink
spots
a
moment
later
the
men
might
have
been
known
as
shadows
if
it
were
not
for
the
involuntary
utterance
of
oaths
that
came
from
them
in
whispers
suddenly
a
holocaust
of
warlike
desire
caught
the
cowboy
and
he
bolted
forward
with
the
speed
of
a
broncho
go
it
johnnie
go
it
kill
him
kill
him
scully
confronted
him
kape
back
he
said
and
by
his
glance
the
cowboy
could
tell
that
this
man
was
johnnie
father
to
the
easterner
there
was
a
monotony
of
unchangeable
fighting
that
was
an
abomination
this
confused
mingling
was
eternal
to
his
sense
which
was
concentrated
in
a
longing
for
the
end
the
priceless
end
once
the
fighters
lurched
near
him
and
as
he
scrambled
hastily
backward
he
heard
them
breathe
like
men
on
the
rack
kill
him
johnnie
kill
him
kill
him
kill
him
the
cowboy
face
was
contorted
like
one
of
those
agony
masks
in
museums
keep
still
said
scully
icily
then
there
was
a
sudden
loud
grunt
incomplete
cut
short
and
johnnie
body
swung
away
from
the
swede
and
fell
with
sickening
heaviness
to
the
grass
the
cowboy
was
barely
in
time
to
prevent
the
mad
swede
from
flinging
himself
upon
his
prone
adversary
no
you
do
said
the
cowboy
interposing
an
arm
wait
a
second
scully
was
at
his
son
side
johnnie
johnnie
me
boy
his
voice
had
a
quality
of
melancholy
tenderness
johnnie
can
you
go
on
with
it
he
looked
anxiously
down
into
the
bloody
pulpy
face
of
his
son
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
johnnie
answered
in
his
ordinary
voice
yes
i
it
yes
assisted
by
his
father
he
struggled
to
his
feet
wait
a
bit
now
till
you
git
your
wind
said
the
old
man
a
few
paces
away
the
cowboy
was
lecturing
the
swede
no
you
do
wait
a
second
the
easterner
was
plucking
at
scully
sleeve
oh
this
is
enough
he
pleaded
this
is
enough
let
it
go
as
it
stands
this
is
enough
bill
said
scully
git
out
of
the
road
the
cowboy
stepped
aside
now
the
combatants
were
actuated
by
a
new
caution
as
they
advanced
towards
collision
they
glared
at
each
other
and
then
the
swede
aimed
a
lightning
blow
that
carried
with
it
his
entire
weight
johnnie
was
evidently
half
stupid
from
weakness
but
he
miraculously
dodged
and
his
fist
sent
the
swede
sprawling
the
cowboy
scully
and
the
easterner
burst
into
a
cheer
that
was
like
a
chorus
of
triumphant
soldiery
but
before
its
conclusion
the
swede
had
scuffled
agilely
to
his
feet
and
come
in
berserk
abandon
at
his
foe
there
was
another
perplexity
of
flying
arms
and
johnnie
body
again
swung
away
and
fell
even
as
a
bundle
might
fall
from
a
roof
the
swede
instantly
staggered
to
a
little
tree
and
leaned
upon
it
breathing
like
an
engine
while
his
savage
and
eyes
roamed
from
face
to
face
as
the
men
bent
over
johnnie
there
was
a
splendor
of
isolation
in
his
situation
at
this
time
which
the
easterner
felt
once
when
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
man
on
the
ground
he
beheld
that
mysterious
and
lonely
figure
waiting
arc
you
any
good
yet
johnnie
asked
scully
in
a
broken
voice
the
son
gasped
and
opened
his
eyes
languidly
after
a
moment
he
answered
no
i
ai
any
good
any
more
then
from
shame
and
bodily
ill
he
began
to
weep
the
tears
furrowing
down
through
the
on
his
face
he
was
too
too
too
heavy
for
me
scully
straightened
and
addressed
the
waiting
figure
stranger
he
said
evenly
it
all
up
with
our
side
then
his
voice
changed
into
that
vibrant
huskiness
which
is
commonly
the
tone
of
the
most
simple
and
deadly
announcements
johnnie
is
whipped
without
replying
the
victor
moved
off
on
the
route
to
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
the
cowboy
was
formulating
new
and
blasphemies
the
easterner
was
startled
to
find
that
they
were
out
in
a
wind
that
seemed
to
come
direct
from
the
shadowed
arctic
floes
he
heard
again
the
wail
of
the
snow
as
it
was
flung
to
its
grave
in
the
south
he
knew
now
that
all
this
time
the
cold
had
been
sinking
into
him
deeper
and
deeper
and
he
wondered
that
he
had
not
perished
he
felt
indifferent
to
the
condition
of
the
vanquished
man
johnnie
can
you
walk
asked
scully
did
i
hurt
hurt
him
any
asked
the
son
can
you
walk
boy
can
you
walk
johnnie
voice
was
suddenly
strong
there
was
a
robust
impatience
in
it
i
asked
you
whether
i
hurt
him
any
yes
yes
johnnie
answered
the
cowboy
consolingly
he
hurt
a
good
deal
they
raised
him
from
the
ground
and
as
soon
as
he
was
on
his
feet
he
went
tottering
off
rebuffing
all
attempts
at
assistance
when
the
party
rounded
the
corner
they
were
fairly
blinded
by
the
pelting
of
the
snow
it
burned
their
faces
like
fire
the
cowboy
carried
johnnie
through
the
drift
to
the
door
as
they
entered
some
cards
again
rose
from
the
floor
and
beat
against
the
wall
the
easterner
rushed
to
the
stove
he
was
so
profoundly
chilled
that
he
almost
dared
to
embrace
the
glowing
iron
the
swede
was
not
in
the
room
johnnie
sank
into
a
chair
and
folding
his
arms
on
his
knees
buried
his
face
in
them
scully
warming
one
foot
and
then
the
other
at
a
rim
of
the
stove
muttered
to
himself
with
celtic
mournfulness
the
cowboy
had
removed
his
fur
cap
and
with
a
dazed
and
rueful
air
he
was
running
one
hand
through
his
tousled
locks
from
overhead
they
could
hear
the
creaking
of
boards
as
the
swede
tramped
here
and
there
in
his
room
the
sad
quiet
was
broken
by
the
sudden
flinging
open
of
a
door
that
led
towards
the
kitchen
it
was
instantly
followed
by
an
inrush
of
women
they
precipitated
themselves
upon
johnnie
amid
a
chorus
of
lamentation
before
they
carried
their
prey
off
to
the
kitchen
there
to
be
bathed
and
harangued
with
that
mixture
of
sympathy
and
abuse
which
is
a
feat
of
their
sex
the
mother
straightened
herself
and
fixed
old
scully
with
an
eye
of
stern
reproach
shame
be
upon
you
patrick
scully
she
cried
your
own
son
too
shame
be
upon
you
there
now
be
quiet
now
said
the
old
man
weakly
shame
be
upon
you
patrick
scully
the
girls
rallying
to
this
slogan
sniffed
disdainfully
in
the
direction
of
those
trembling
accomplices
the
cowboy
and
the
easterner
presently
they
bore
johnnie
away
and
left
the
three
men
to
dismal
reflection
vii
i
like
to
fight
this
here
dutchman
myself
said
the
cowboy
breaking
a
long
silence
scully
wagged
his
head
sadly
no
that
would
do
it
would
be
right
it
would
be
right
well
why
would
it
argued
the
cowboy
i
do
see
no
harm
in
it
no
answered
scully
with
mournful
heroism
it
would
be
right
it
was
johnnie
fight
and
now
we
must
whip
the
man
just
because
he
whipped
johnnie
yes
that
true
enough
said
the
cowboy
but
he
better
not
get
fresh
with
me
because
i
could
stand
no
more
of
it
you
not
say
a
word
to
him
commanded
scully
and
even
then
they
heard
the
tread
of
the
swede
on
the
stairs
his
entrance
was
made
theatric
he
swept
the
door
back
with
a
bang
and
swaggered
to
the
middle
of
the
room
no
one
looked
at
him
well
he
cried
insolently
at
scully
i
you
tell
me
now
how
much
i
owe
you
the
old
man
remained
stolid
you
do
owe
me
nothin
huh
said
the
swede
huh
do
owe
nothin
the
cowboy
addressed
the
swede
stranger
i
do
see
how
you
come
to
be
so
gay
around
here
old
scully
was
instantly
alert
stop
he
shouted
holding
his
hand
forth
fingers
upward
bill
you
shut
up
the
cowboy
spat
carelessly
into
the
sawdust
box
i
did
say
a
word
did
i
he
asked
scully
called
the
swede
how
much
do
i
owe
you
it
was
seen
that
he
was
attired
for
departure
and
that
he
had
his
valise
in
his
hand
you
do
owe
me
nothin
repeated
scully
in
his
same
imperturbable
way
huh
said
the
swede
i
guess
you
right
i
guess
if
it
was
any
way
at
all
you
owe
me
somethin
that
what
i
guess
he
turned
to
the
cowboy
him
kill
him
kill
him
he
mimicked
and
then
guffawed
victoriously
him
he
was
convulsed
with
ironical
humor
but
he
might
have
been
jeering
the
dead
the
three
men
were
immovable
and
silent
staring
with
glassy
eyes
at
the
stove
the
swede
opened
the
door
and
passed
into
the
storm
giving
one
derisive
glance
backward
at
the
still
group
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
scully
and
the
cowboy
leaped
to
their
feet
and
began
to
curse
they
trampled
to
and
fro
waving
their
arms
and
smashing
into
the
air
with
their
fists
oh
but
that
was
a
hard
minute
wailed
scully
that
was
a
hard
minute
him
there
leerin
and
scoffin
one
bang
at
his
nose
was
worth
forty
dollars
to
me
that
minute
how
did
you
stand
it
bill
how
did
i
stand
it
cried
the
cowboy
in
a
quivering
voice
how
did
i
stand
it
oh
the
old
man
burst
into
sudden
brogue
i
loike
to
take
that
swade
he
wailed
and
hould
down
on
a
shtone
flure
and
bate
to
a
jelly
wid
a
shtick
the
cowboy
groaned
in
sympathy
i
like
to
git
him
by
the
neck
and
him
he
brought
his
hand
down
on
a
chair
with
a
noise
like
a
hammer
that
there
dutchman
until
he
could
tell
himself
from
a
dead
coyote
i
bate
until
he
i
show
some
things
and
then
together
they
raised
a
yearning
fanatic
cry
if
we
only
could
yes
yes
and
then
i
viii
the
swede
tightly
gripping
his
valise
tacked
across
the
face
of
the
storm
as
if
he
carried
sails
he
was
following
a
line
of
little
naked
gasping
trees
which
he
knew
must
mark
the
way
of
the
road
his
face
fresh
from
the
pounding
of
johnnie
fists
felt
more
pleasure
than
pain
in
the
wind
and
the
driving
snow
a
number
of
square
shapes
loomed
upon
him
finally
and
he
knew
them
as
the
houses
of
the
main
body
of
the
town
he
found
a
street
and
made
travel
along
it
leaning
heavily
upon
the
wind
whenever
at
a
corner
a
terrific
blast
caught
him
he
might
have
been
in
a
deserted
village
we
picture
the
world
as
thick
with
conquering
and
elate
humanity
but
here
with
the
bugles
of
the
tempest
pealing
it
was
hard
to
imagine
a
peopled
earth
one
viewed
the
existence
of
man
then
as
a
marvel
and
conceded
a
glamour
of
wonder
to
these
lice
which
were
caused
to
cling
to
a
whirling
bulb
the
conceit
of
man
was
explained
by
this
storm
to
be
the
very
engine
of
life
one
was
a
coxcomb
not
to
die
in
it
however
the
swede
found
a
saloon
in
front
of
it
an
indomitable
red
light
was
burning
and
the
were
made
blood
color
as
they
flew
through
the
circumscribed
territory
of
the
lamp
shining
the
swede
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
saloon
and
entered
a
sanded
expanse
was
before
him
and
at
the
end
of
it
four
men
sat
about
a
table
drinking
down
one
side
of
the
room
extended
a
radiant
bar
and
its
guardian
was
leaning
upon
his
elbows
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
men
at
the
table
the
swede
dropped
his
valise
upon
the
floor
and
smiling
fraternally
upon
the
barkeeper
said
gim
me
some
whiskey
will
you
the
man
placed
a
bottle
a
and
a
glass
of
water
upon
the
bar
the
swede
poured
himself
an
abnormal
portion
of
whiskey
and
drank
it
in
three
gulps
pretty
bad
night
remarked
the
bartender
indifferently
he
was
making
the
pretension
of
blindness
which
is
usually
a
distinction
of
his
class
but
it
could
have
been
seen
that
he
was
furtively
studying
the
on
the
face
of
the
swede
bad
night
he
said
again
oh
it
good
enough
for
me
replied
the
swede
hardily
as
he
poured
himself
some
more
whiskey
the
barkeeper
took
his
coin
and
maneuvered
it
through
its
reception
by
the
highly
nickelled
a
bell
rang
a
card
labelled
cts
had
appeared
no
continued
the
swede
this
is
too
bad
weather
it
good
enough
for
me
so
murmured
the
barkeeper
languidly
the
copious
drams
made
the
swede
eyes
swim
and
he
breathed
a
trifle
heavier
yes
i
like
this
weather
i
like
it
it
suits
me
it
was
apparently
his
design
to
impart
a
deep
significance
to
these
words
so
murmured
the
bartender
again
he
turned
to
gaze
dreamily
at
the
birds
and
scrolls
which
had
been
drawn
with
soap
upon
the
mirrors
back
of
the
bar
well
i
guess
i
take
another
drink
said
the
swede
presently
have
something
no
thanks
i
not
drinkin
answered
the
bartender
afterwards
he
asked
how
did
you
hurt
your
face
the
swede
immediately
began
to
boast
loudly
why
in
a
fight
i
thumped
the
soul
out
of
a
man
down
here
at
scully
hotel
the
interest
of
the
four
men
at
the
table
was
at
last
aroused
who
was
it
said
one
johnnie
scully
blustered
the
swede
son
of
the
man
what
runs
it
he
will
be
pretty
near
dead
for
some
weeks
i
can
tell
you
i
made
a
nice
thing
of
him
i
did
he
could
get
up
they
carried
him
in
the
house
have
a
drink
instantly
the
men
in
some
subtle
way
incased
themselves
in
reserve
no
thanks
said
one
the
group
was
of
curious
formation
two
were
prominent
local
business
men
one
was
the
and
one
was
a
professional
gambler
of
the
kind
known
as
square
but
a
scrutiny
of
the
group
would
not
have
enabled
an
observer
to
pick
the
gambler
from
the
men
of
more
reputable
pursuits
he
was
in
fact
a
man
so
delicate
in
manner
when
among
people
of
fair
class
and
so
judicious
in
his
choice
of
victims
that
in
the
strictly
masculine
part
of
the
town
life
he
had
come
to
be
explicitly
trusted
and
admired
people
called
him
a
thoroughbred
the
fear
and
contempt
with
which
his
craft
was
regarded
was
undoubtedly
the
reason
that
his
quiet
dignity
shone
conspicuous
above
the
quiet
dignity
of
men
who
might
be
merely
hatters
billiard
markers
or
beyond
an
occasional
unwary
traveller
who
came
by
rail
this
gambler
was
supposed
to
prey
solely
upon
reckless
and
senile
farmers
who
when
flush
with
good
crops
drove
into
town
in
all
the
pride
and
confidence
of
an
absolutely
invulnerable
stupidity
hearing
at
times
in
circuitous
fashion
of
the
despoilment
of
such
a
farmer
the
important
men
of
romper
invariably
laughed
in
contempt
of
the
victim
and
if
they
thought
of
the
wolf
at
all
it
was
with
a
kind
of
pride
at
the
knowledge
that
he
would
never
dare
think
of
attacking
their
wisdom
and
courage
besides
it
was
popular
that
this
gambler
had
a
real
wife
and
two
real
children
in
a
neat
cottage
in
a
suburb
where
he
led
an
exemplary
home
life
and
when
any
one
even
suggested
a
discrepancy
in
his
character
the
crowd
immediately
vociferated
descriptions
of
this
virtuous
family
circle
then
men
who
led
exemplary
home
lives
and
men
who
did
not
lead
exemplary
home
lives
all
subsided
in
a
bunch
remarking
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
however
when
a
restriction
was
placed
upon
him
as
for
instance
when
a
strong
clique
of
members
of
the
new
pollywog
club
refused
to
permit
him
even
as
a
spectator
to
appear
in
the
rooms
of
the
organization
the
candor
and
gentleness
with
which
he
accepted
the
judgment
disarmed
many
of
his
foes
and
made
his
friends
more
desperately
partisan
he
invariably
distinguished
between
himself
and
a
respectable
romper
man
so
quickly
and
frankly
that
his
manner
actually
appeared
to
be
a
continual
broadcast
compliment
and
one
must
not
forget
to
declare
the
fundamental
fact
of
his
entire
position
in
romper
it
is
irrefutable
that
in
all
affairs
outside
of
his
business
in
all
matters
that
occur
eternally
and
commonly
between
man
and
man
this
thieving
was
so
generous
so
just
so
moral
that
in
a
contest
he
could
have
put
to
flight
the
consciences
of
of
the
citizens
of
romper
and
so
it
happened
that
he
was
seated
in
this
saloon
with
the
two
prominent
local
merchants
and
the
the
swede
continued
to
drink
raw
whiskey
meanwhile
babbling
at
the
barkeeper
and
trying
to
induce
him
to
indulge
in
potations
come
on
have
a
drink
come
on
what
no
well
have
a
little
one
then
by
gawd
i
whipped
a
man
and
i
want
to
celebrate
i
whipped
him
good
too
gentlemen
the
swede
cried
to
the
men
at
the
table
have
a
drink
ssh
said
the
barkeeper
the
group
at
the
table
although
furtively
attentive
had
been
pretending
to
be
deep
in
talk
but
now
a
man
lifted
his
eyes
towards
the
swede
and
said
shortly
thanks
we
do
want
any
more
at
this
reply
the
swede
ruffled
out
his
chest
like
a
rooster
well
he
exploded
it
seems
i
ca
get
anybody
to
drink
with
me
in
this
town
seems
so
do
it
well
ssh
said
the
barkeeper
say
snarled
the
swede
do
you
try
to
shut
me
up
i
wo
have
it
i
a
gentleman
and
i
want
people
to
drink
with
me
and
i
want
to
drink
with
me
now
do
you
understand
he
rapped
the
bar
with
his
knuckles
years
of
experience
had
calloused
the
bartender
he
merely
grew
sulky
i
hear
you
he
answered
well
cried
the
swede
listen
hard
then
see
those
men
over
there
well
they
going
to
drink
with
me
and
do
you
forget
it
now
you
watch
hi
yelled
the
barkeeper
this
wo
do
why
wo
it
demanded
the
swede
he
stalked
over
to
the
table
and
by
chance
laid
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
gambler
how
about
this
he
asked
wrathfully
i
asked
you
to
drink
with
me
the
gambler
simply
twisted
his
head
and
spoke
over
his
shoulder
my
friend
i
do
know
you
oh
hell
answered
the
swede
come
and
have
a
drink
now
my
boy
advised
the
gambler
kindly
take
your
hand
off
my
shoulder
and
go
and
mind
your
own
business
he
was
a
little
slim
man
and
it
seemed
strange
to
hear
him
use
this
tone
of
heroic
patronage
to
the
burly
swede
the
other
men
at
the
table
said
nothing
what
you
wo
drink
with
me
you
little
dude
i
make
you
then
i
make
you
the
swede
had
grasped
the
gambler
frenziedly
at
the
throat
and
was
dragging
him
from
his
chair
the
other
men
sprang
up
the
barkeeper
dashed
around
the
corner
of
his
bar
there
was
a
great
tumult
and
then
was
seen
a
long
blade
in
the
hand
of
the
gambler
it
shot
forward
and
a
human
body
this
citadel
of
virtue
wisdom
power
was
pierced
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
melon
the
swede
fell
with
a
cry
of
supreme
astonishment
the
prominent
merchants
and
the
district
attorney
must
have
at
once
tumbled
out
of
the
place
backward
the
bartender
found
himself
hanging
limply
to
the
arm
of
a
chair
and
gazing
into
the
eyes
of
a
murderer
henry
said
the
latter
as
he
wiped
his
knife
on
one
of
the
towels
that
hung
beneath
the
you
tell
where
to
find
me
be
home
waiting
for
then
he
vanished
a
moment
afterwards
the
barkeeper
was
in
the
street
dinning
through
the
storm
for
help
and
moreover
companionship
the
corpse
of
the
swede
alone
in
the
saloon
had
its
eyes
fixed
upon
a
dreadful
legend
that
dwelt
atop
of
the
this
registers
the
amount
of
your
purchase
ix
months
later
the
cowboy
was
frying
pork
over
the
stove
of
a
little
ranch
near
the
dakota
line
when
there
was
a
quick
thud
of
hoofs
outside
and
presently
the
easterner
entered
with
the
letters
and
the
papers
well
said
the
easterner
at
once
the
chap
that
killed
the
swede
has
got
three
years
was
much
was
it
he
has
three
years
the
cowboy
poised
his
pan
of
pork
while
he
ruminated
upon
the
news
three
years
that
ai
much
no
it
was
a
light
sentence
replied
the
easterner
as
he
unbuckled
his
spurs
seems
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
for
him
in
romper
if
the
bartender
had
been
any
good
observed
the
cowboy
thoughtfully
he
would
have
gone
in
and
cracked
that
there
dutchman
on
the
head
with
a
bottle
in
the
beginnin
of
it
and
stopped
all
this
here
murderin
yes
a
thousand
things
might
have
happened
said
the
easterner
tartly
the
cowboy
returned
his
pan
of
pork
to
the
fire
but
his
philosophy
continued
it
funny
ai
it
if
he
had
said
johnnie
was
cheatin
he
be
alive
this
minute
he
was
an
awful
fool
game
played
for
fun
too
not
for
money
i
believe
he
was
crazy
i
feel
sorry
for
that
gambler
said
the
easterner
oh
so
do
i
said
the
cowboy
he
do
deserve
none
of
it
for
killin
who
he
did
the
swede
might
not
have
been
killed
if
everything
had
been
square
might
not
have
been
killed
exclaimed
the
cowboy
square
why
when
he
said
that
johnnie
was
cheatin
and
acted
like
such
a
jackass
and
then
in
the
saloon
he
fairly
walked
up
to
git
hurt
with
these
arguments
the
cowboy
browbeat
the
easterner
and
reduced
him
to
rage
you
a
fool
cried
the
easterner
viciously
you
a
bigger
jackass
than
the
swede
by
a
million
majority
now
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
let
me
tell
you
something
listen
johnnie
cheating
said
the
cowboy
blankly
there
was
a
minute
of
silence
and
then
he
said
robustly
why
no
the
game
was
only
for
fun
fun
or
not
said
the
easterner
johnnie
was
cheating
i
saw
him
i
know
it
i
saw
him
and
i
refused
to
stand
up
and
be
a
man
i
let
the
swede
fight
it
out
alone
and
you
you
were
simply
puffing
around
the
place
and
wanting
to
fight
and
then
old
scully
himself
we
are
all
in
it
this
poor
gambler
is
even
a
noun
he
is
kind
of
an
adverb
every
sin
is
the
result
of
a
collaboration
we
five
of
us
have
collaborated
in
the
murder
of
this
swede
usually
there
are
from
a
dozen
to
forty
women
really
involved
in
every
murder
but
in
this
case
it
seems
to
be
only
five
men
you
i
johnnie
old
scully
and
that
fool
of
an
unfortunate
gambler
came
merely
as
a
culmination
the
apex
of
a
human
movement
and
gets
all
the
punishment
the
cowboy
injured
and
rebellious
cried
out
blindly
into
this
fog
of
mysterious
theory
well
i
did
do
anythin
did
i
his
new
mittens
i
little
horace
was
walking
home
from
school
brilliantly
decorated
by
a
pair
of
new
red
mittens
a
number

boys
were
snowballing
gleefully
in
a
field
they
hailed

was
sad
no
he
said
i
ca
i
got
to
go
home
at
noon
his
mother

admonished
him
now
horace
you
come
straight
home
as
soon
as
school
is
out
do
you
hear
and
do
you
get
them
nice
new
mittens
all
wet
either
do
you
hear
also
his
aunt
had
said
i
declare
emily
it
a
shame
the
way
you
allow
that
child
to
ruin
his
things
she
had
meant
mittens
to
his
mother
horace
had
dutifully
replied
yes
but
he
now
loitered
in
the
vicinity
of
the
group
of
uproarious
boys
who
were
yelling
like
hawks
as
the
white
balls
flew

yelling
like
hawks
as
the

balls
flew
some
of
them
immediately
analyzed
this
extraordinary
hesitancy
hah
they
paused
to
scoff
afraid
of
your
new
mittens
ai
you
some
smaller
boys
who
were
not
yet
so
wise
in
discerning
motives
applauded
this
attack
with
unreasonable
vehemence
of
his
of
his
they
sang
these
lines
to
cruel
and
monotonous
music
which
is
as
old
perhaps
as
american
childhood
and
which
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
emancipated
adult
to
completely
forget
of
his
horace
cast
a
tortured
glance
towards
his
playmates
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
snow
at
his
feet
presently
he
turned
to
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
great
that
lined
the
curb
he
made
a
pretence
of
closely
examining
the
rough
and
virile
bark
to
his
mind
this
familiar
street
of
whilomville
seemed
to
grow
dark
in
the
thick
shadow
of
shame
the
trees
and
the
houses
were
now
palled
in
purple
of
his
the
terrible
music
had
in
it
a
meaning
from
the
moonlit
of
chanting
cannibals

horace
i
got
to
go
home
at
last
horace
with
supreme
effort
raised
his
head

said
gruffly

got
to
go
home

all
whereupon
each
boy
held
his
left
forefinger
as
if
it
were
a
pencil
and
began
to
sharpen
it
derisively
with
his
right
forefinger
they
came
closer
and
sang
like
a
trained
chorus
of
his
mittens
when
he
raised
his
voice
to
deny
the
charge
it
was
simply
lost
in
the
screams
of
the
mob
he
was
alone
fronting
all
the
traditions
of
boyhood
held
before
him
by
inexorable
representatives

such
a
low
state

he
fallen
that
one
lad
a
mere
baby
outflanked
him

then
struck
him
in
the
cheek

a
heavy
snowball

act
was
acclaimed
with
loud
jeers

turned
to
dart
at
his
assailant

there
was
an
immediate
demonstration
on
the
other
flank

he
found
himself
obliged
to
keep
his
face
towards
the
hilarious
crew

tormentors
the
baby
retreated
in
safety
to
the
rear
of
the
crowd

he
was
received
with
fulsome
compliments
upon
his
daring
horace
retreated
slowly
up
the
walk

continually
tried
to
make
them
heed
him
but
the
only
sound
was
the
chant

his
in
this
desperate
withdrawal
the
beset
and
haggard
boy
suffered
more
than
is
the
common
lot

raised

dismal
conviction
that
they
were
going
to
dog
him
to
his
grave
but
near
the
corner
of
the
field
they
suddenly
seemed
to
forget
all
about
it
indeed
they
possessed
only
the
malevolence
of
so
many
sparrows
the
interest
had
swung
capriciously
to
some
other
matter
in
a
moment
they
were
off
in
the
field
again
carousing
amid
the
snow
some
authoritative
boy
had
probably
said
aw
come
on
illustration
aw
come
on
as
the
pursuit
ceased
horace
ceased
his
retreat
he
spent
some
time
in
what
was
evidently
an
attempt
to
adjust
his
self
respect
and
then
began
to
wander
furtively
down
towards
the
group
he
too
had
undergone
an
important
change
perhaps
his
sharp
agony
was
only
as
durable
as
the
malevolence
of
the
others
in
this
boyish
life
obedience
to
some
unformulated
creed
of
manners
was
enforced
with
capricious
but
merciless
rigor
however
they
were
after
all
his
comrades
his
friends
they
did
not
heed
his
return
they
were
engaged
in
an
altercation
it
had
evidently
been
planned
that
this
battle
was
between
indians
and
soldiers
the
smaller
and
weaker
boys
had
been
induced
to
appear
as
indians
in
the
initial
skirmish
but
they
were
now
very
sick
of
it
and
were
reluctantly
but
steadfastly
affirming
their
desire
for
a
change
of
caste
the
larger
boys
had
all
won
great
distinction
devastating
indians
materially
and
they
wished
the
war
to
go
on
as
planned
they
explained
vociferously
that
it
was
proper
for
the
soldiers
always
to
thrash
the
indians
the
little
boys
did
not
pretend
to
deny
the
truth
of
this
argument
they
confined
themselves
to
the
simple
statement
that
in
that
case
they
wished
to
be
soldiers
each
little
boy
willingly
appealed
to
the
others
to
remain
indians
but
as
for
himself
he
reiterated
his
desire
to
enlist
as
a
soldier
the
larger
boys
were
in
despair
over
this
dearth
of
enthusiasm
in
the
small
indians
they
alternately
wheedled
and
bullied
but
they
could
not
persuade
the
little
boys
who
were
really
suffering
dreadful
humiliation
rather
than
submit
to
another
onslaught
of
soldiers
they
were
called
all
the
baby
names
that
had
the
power
of
stinging
deep
into
their
pride
but
they
remained
firm
then
a
formidable
lad
a
leader
of
reputation
one
who
could
whip
many
boys
that
wore
long
trousers
suddenly
blew
out
his
checks
and
shouted
well
all
right
then
i
be
an
indian
myself
now
the
little
boys
greeted
with
cheers
this
addition
to
their
wearied
ranks
and
seemed
then
content
but
matters
were
not
mended
in
the
least
because
all
of
the
personal
following
of
the
formidable
lad
with
the
addition
of
every
outsider
spontaneously
forsook
the
flag
and
declared
themselves
indians
there
were
now
no
soldiers
the
indians
had
carried
everything
unanimously
the
formidable
lad
used
his
influence
but
his
influence
could
not
shake
the
loyalty
of
his
friends
who
refused
to
fight
under
any
colors
but
his
colors
plainly
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
coerce
the
little
ones
the
formidable
lad
again
became
a
soldier
and
then
graciously
permitted
to
join
him
all
the
real
fighting
strength
of
the
crowd
leaving
behind
a
most
forlorn
band
of
little
indians
then
the
soldiers
attacked
the
indians
exhorting
them
to
opposition
at
the
same
time
the
indians
at
first
adopted
a
policy
of
hurried
surrender
but
this
had
no
success
as
none
of
the
surrenders
were
accepted
they
then
turned
to
flee
bawling
out
protests
the
ferocious
soldiers
pursued
them
amid
shouts
the
battle
widened
developing
all
manner
of
marvellous
detail
horace
had
turned
towards
home
several
times
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
scene
held
him
in
a
spell
it
was
fascinating
beyond
anything
which
the
grown
man
understands
he
had
always
in
the
back
of
his
head
a
sense
of
guilt
even
a
sense
of
impending
punishment
for
disobedience
but
they
could
not
weigh
with
the
delirium
of
this
ii
one
of
the
raiding
soldiers
espying
horace
called
out
in
passing
of
his
horace
flinched
at
this
renewal
and
the
other
lad
paused
to
taunt
him
again
horace
scooped
some
snow
moulded
it
into
a
ball
and
flung
it
at
the
other
ho
cried
the
boy
you
an
indian
are
you
hey
fellers
here
an
indian
that
been
killed
yet
he
and
horace
engaged
in
a
duel
in
which
both
were
in
such
haste
to
mould
snowballs
that
they
had
little
time
for
aiming
horace
once
struck
his
opponent
squarely
in
the
chest
hey
he
shouted
you
dead
you
ca
fight
any
more
pete
i
killed
you
you
dead
the
other
boy
flushed
red
but
he
continued
frantically
to
make
ammunition
you
never
touched
me
he
retorted
glowering
you
never
touched
me
where
now
he
added
defiantly
where
did
you
hit
me
on
the
coat
right
on
your
breast
you
ca
fight
any
more
dead
you
never
i
did
too
hey
fellers
ai
he
dead
i
hit
square
he
never
nobody
had
seen
the
affair
but
some
of
the
boys
took
sides
in
absolute
accordance
with
their
friendship
for
one
of
the
concerned
parties
horace
opponent
went
about
contending
he
never
touched
me
he
never
came
near
me
he
never
came
near
me
the
formidable
leader
now
came
forward
and
accosted
horace
what
was
you
an
indian
well
then
you
dead
that
all
he
hit
you
i
saw
him
me
shrieked
horace
he
never
came
within
a
mile
of
me
at
that
moment
he
heard
his
name
called
in
a
certain
familiar
tune
of
two
notes
with
the
last
note
shrill
and
prolonged
he
looked
towards
the
sidewalk
and
saw
his
mother
standing
there
in
her
widow
weeds
with
two
brown
paper
parcels
under
her
arm
a
silence
had
fallen
upon
all
the
boys
horace
moved
slowly
towards
his
mother
she
did
not
seem
to
note
his
approach
she
was
gazing
austerely
off
through
the
naked
branches
of
the
maples
where
two
crimson
sunset
bars
lay
on
the
deep
blue
sky
at
a
distance
of
ten
paces
horace
made
a
desperate
venture
oh
ma
he
whined
ca
i
stay
out
for
a
while
no
she
answered
solemnly
you
come
with
me
horace
knew
that
profile
it
was
the
inexorable
profile
but
he
continued
to
plead
because
it
was
not
beyond
his
mind
that
a
great
show
of
suffering
now
might
diminish
his
suffering
later
he
did
not
dare
to
look
back
at
his
playmates
it
was
already
a
public
scandal
that
he
could
not
stay
out
as
late
as
other
boys
and
he
could
imagine
his
standing
now
that
he
had
been
again
dragged
off
by
his
mother
in
sight
of
the
whole
world
he
was
a
profoundly
miserable
human
being
aunt
martha
opened
the
door
for
them
light
streamed
about
her
straight
skirt
oh
she
said
so
you
found
him
on
the
road
eh
well
i
declare
it
was
about
time
horace
slunk
into
the
kitchen
the
stove
straddling
out
on
its
four
iron
legs
was
gently
humming
aunt
martha
had
evidently
just
lighted
the
lamp
for
she
went
to
it
and
began
to
twist
the
wick
experimentally
illustration
let
see
them
mittens
now
said
the
mother
let
see
them
mittens
horace
chin
sank
the
aspiration
of
the
criminal
the
passionate
desire
for
an
asylum
from
retribution
from
justice
was
aflame
in
his
heart
i
i
do
do
know
where
they
are
he
gasped
finally
as
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
pockets
horace
intoned
his
mother
you
are
tellin
me
a
story
a
story
he
answered
just
above
his
breath
he
looked
like
a
his
mother
held
him
by
the
arm
and
began
to
search
his
pockets
almost
at
once
she
was
able
to
bring
forth
a
pair
of
very
wet
mittens
well
i
declare
cried
aunt
martha
the
two
women
went
close
to
the
lamp
and
minutely
examined
the
mittens
turning
them
over
and
over
afterwards
when
horace
looked
up
his
mother
homely
face
was
turned
towards
him
he
burst
into
tears
his
mother
drew
a
chair
near
the
stove
just
you
sit
there
now
until
i
tell
you
to
git
off
he
sidled
meekly
into
the
chair
his
mother
and
his
aunt
went
briskly
about
the
business
of
preparing
supper
they
did
not
display
a
knowledge
of
his
existence
they
carried
an
effect
of
oblivion
so
far
that
they
even
did
not
speak
to
each
other
presently
they
went
into
the
dining
and
living
room
horace
could
hear
the
dishes
rattling
his
aunt
martha
brought
a
plate
of
food
placed
it
on
a
chair
near
him
and
went
away
without
a
word
illustration
brought
a
plate
of
food
horace
instantly
decided
that
he
would
not
touch
a
morsel
of
the
food
he
had
often
used
this
ruse
in
dealing
with
his
mother
he
did
not
know
why
it
brought
her
to
terms
but
certainly
it
sometimes
did
the
mother
looked
up
when
the
aunt
returned
to
the
other
room
is
he
eatin
his
supper
she
asked
the
maiden
aunt
fortified
in
ignorance
gazed
with
pity
and
contempt
upon
this
interest
well
now
emily
how
do
i
know
she
queried
was
i
goin
to
stand
over
of
all
the
worryin
you
do
about
that
child
it
a
shame
the
way
you
bringin
up
that
child
well
he
ought
to
eat
somethin
it
wo
do
fer
him
to
go
without
eatin
the
mother
retorted
weakly
aunt
martha
profoundly
scorning
the
policy
of
concession
which
these
words
meant
uttered
a
long
contemptuous
sigh
iii
alone
in
the
kitchen
horace
stared
with
sombre
eyes
at
the
plate
of
food
for
a
long
time
he
betrayed
no
sign
of
yielding
his
mood
was
adamantine
he
was
resolved
not
to
sell
his
vengeance
for
bread
cold
ham
and
a
pickle
and
yet
it
must
be
known
that
the
sight
of
them
affected
him
powerfully
the
pickle
in
particular
was
notable
for
its
seductive
charm
he
surveyed
it
darkly
illustration
horace
stared
with
sombre
eyes
at
the
plate
of
food
but
at
last
unable
to
longer
endure
his
state
his
attitude
in
the
presence
of
the
pickle
he
put
out
an
inquisitive
finger
and
touched
it
and
it
was
cool
and
green
and
plump
then
a
full
conception
of
the
cruel
woe
of
his
situation
swept
upon
him
suddenly
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
which
began
to
move
down
his
cheeks
he
sniffled
his
heart
was
black
with
hatred
he
painted
in
his
mind
scenes
of
deadly
retribution
his
mother
would
be
taught
that
he
was
not
one
to
endure
persecution
meekly
without
raising
an
arm
in
his
defence
and
so
his
dreams
were
of
a
slaughter
of
feelings
and
near
the
end
of
them
his
mother
was
pictured
as
coming
bowed
with
pain
to
his
feet
weeping
she
implored
his
charity
would
he
forgive
her
no
his
once
tender
heart
had
been
turned
to
stone
by
her
injustice
he
could
not
forgive
her
she
must
pay
the
inexorable
penalty
the
first
item
in
this
horrible
plan
was
the
refusal
of
the
food
this
he
knew
by
experience
would
work
havoc
in
his
mother
heart
and
so
he
grimly
waited
but
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
first
part
of
his
revenge
was
in
danger
of
failing
the
thought
struck
him
that
his
mother
might
not
capitulate
in
the
usual
way
according
to
his
recollection
the
time
was
more
than
due
when
she
should
come
in
worried
sadly
affectionate
and
ask
him
if
he
was
ill
it
had
then
been
his
custom
to
hint
in
a
resigned
voice
that
he
was
the
victim
of
secret
disease
but
that
he
preferred
to
suffer
in
silence
and
alone
if
she
was
obdurate
in
her
anxiety
he
always
asked
her
in
a
gloomy
low
voice
to
go
away
and
leave
him
to
suffer
in
silence
and
alone
in
the
darkness
without
food
he
had
known
this
maneuvering
to
result
even
in
pie
but
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
long
pause
and
the
stillness
had
his
old
and
valued
ruse
betrayed
him
as
the
truth
sank
into
his
mind
he
supremely
loathed
life
the
world
his
mother
her
heart
was
beating
back
the
besiegers
he
was
a
defeated
child
he
wept
for
a
time
before
deciding
upon
the
final
stroke
he
would
run
away
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
world
he
would
become
some
sort
of
person
driven
to
a
life
of
crime
by
the
barbarity
of
his
mother
she
should
never
know
his
fate
he
would
torture
her
for
years
with
doubts
and
doubts
and
drive
her
implacably
to
a
repentant
grave
nor
would
aunt
martha
escape
some
day
a
century
hence
when
his
mother
was
dead
he
would
write
to
his
aunt
martha
and
point
out
her
part
in
the
blighting
of
his
life
for
one
blow
against
him
now
he
would
in
time
deal
back
a
thousand
aye
ten
thousand
illustration
some
sort
of
person
he
arose
and
took
his
coat
and
cap
as
he
moved
stealthily
towards
the
door
he
cast
a
glance
backward
at
the
pickle
he
was
tempted
to
take
it
but
he
knew
that
if
he
left
the
plate
inviolate
his
mother
would
feel
even
worse
a
blue
snow
was
falling
people
bowed
forward
were
moving
briskly
along
the
walks
the
electric
lamps
hummed
amid
showers
of
flakes
as
horace
emerged
from
the
kitchen
a
shrill
squall
drove
the
flakes
around
the
corner
of
the
house
he
cowered
away
from
it
and
its
violence
illumined
his
mind
vaguely
in
new
directions
he
deliberated
upon
a
choice
of
remote
corners
of
the
globe
he
found
that
he
had
no
plans
which
were
definite
enough
in
a
geographical
way
but
without
much
loss
of
time
he
decided
upon
california
he
moved
briskly
as
far
as
his
mother
front
gate
on
the
road
to
california
he
was
off
at
last
his
success
was
a
trifle
dreadful
his
throat
choked
illustration
people
bowed
forward
but
at
the
gate
he
paused
he
did
not
know
if
his
journey
to
california
would
be
shorter
if
he
went
down
niagara
avenue
or
off
through
hogan
street
as
the
storm
was
very
cold
and
the
point
was
very
important
he
decided
to
withdraw
for
reflection
to
the
he
entered
the
dark
shanty
and
took
seat
upon
the
old
upon
which
he
was
supposed
to
perform
for
a
few
minutes
every
afternoon
when
he
returned
from
school
the
wind
screamed
and
shouted
at
the
loose
boards
and
there
was
a
rift
of
snow
on
the
floor
to
leeward
of
a
crack
here
the
idea
of
starting
for
california
on
such
a
night
departed
from
his
mind
leaving
him
ruminating
miserably
upon
his
martyrdom
he
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
sleep
all
night
in
the
and
start
for
california
in
the
morning
bright
and
early
thinking
of
his
bed
he
kicked
over
the
floor
and
found
that
the
innumerable
chips
were
all
frozen
tightly
bedded
in
ice
later
he
viewed
with
joy
some
signs
of
excitement
in
the
house
the
flare
of
a
lamp
moved
rapidly
from
window
to
window
then
the
kitchen
door
slammed
loudly
and
a
shawled
figure
sped
towards
the
gate
at
last
he
was
making
them
feel
his
power
the
shivering
child
face
was
lit
with
saturnine
glee
as
in
the
darkness
of
the
he
gloated
over
the
evidences
of
consternation
in
his
home
the
shawled
figure
had
been
his
aunt
martha
dashing
with
the
alarm
to
the
neighbors
the
cold
of
the
was
tormenting
him
he
endured
only
because
of
the
terror
he
was
causing
but
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
they
instituted
a
search
for
him
they
would
probably
examine
the
he
knew
that
it
would
not
be
manful
to
be
caught
so
soon
he
was
not
positive
now
that
he
was
going
to
remain
away
forever
but
at
any
rate
he
was
bound
to
inflict
some
more
damage
before
allowing
himself
to
be
captured
if
he
merely
succeeded
in
making
his
mother
angry
she
would
thrash
him
on
sight
he
must
prolong
the
time
in
order
to
be
safe
if
he
held
out
properly
he
was
sure
of
a
welcome
of
love
even
though
he
should
drip
with
crimes
evidently
the
storm
had
increased
for
when
he
went
out
it
swung
him
violently
with
its
rough
and
merciless
strength
panting
stung
half
blinded
with
the
driving
flakes
he
was
now
a
waif
exiled
friendless
and
poor
with
a
bursting
heart
he
thought
of
his
home
and
his
mother
to
his
forlorn
vision
they
were
as
far
away
as
heaven
iv
horace
was
undergoing
changes
of
feeling
so
rapidly
that
he
was
merely
moved
hither
and
then
thither
like
a
kite
he
was
now
aghast
at
the
merciless
ferocity
of
his
mother
it
was
she
who
had
thrust
him
into
this
wild
storm
and
she
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
his
fate
perfectly
indifferent
the
forlorn
wanderer
could
no
longer
weep
the
strong
sobs
caught
at
his
throat
making
his
breath
come
in
short
quick
snuffles
all
in
him
was
conquered
save
the
enigmatical
childish
ideal
of
form
manner
this
principle
still
held
out
and
it
was
the
only
thing
between
him
and
submission
when
he
surrendered
he
must
surrender
in
a
way
that
deferred
to
the
undefined
code
he
longed
simply
to
go
to
the
kitchen
and
stumble
in
but
his
unfathomable
sense
of
fitness
forbade
him
presently
he
found
himself
at
the
head
of
niagara
avenue
staring
through
the
snow
into
the
blazing
windows
of
stickney
stickney
was
the
family
butcher
not
so
much
because
of
a
superiority
to
other
whilomville
butchers
as
because
he
lived
next
door
and
had
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
father
of
horace
rows
of
glowing
pigs
hung
head
downward
back
of
the
tables
which
bore
huge
pieces
of
red
beef
clumps
of
attenuated
turkeys
were
suspended
here
and
there
stickney
hale
and
smiling
was
bantering
with
a
woman
in
a
cloak
who
with
a
monster
basket
on
her
arm
was
dickering
for
eight
worth
of
some
thing
horace
watched
them
through
a
crusted
pane
when
the
woman
came
out
and
passed
him
he
went
towards
the
door
he
touched
the
latch
with
his
finger
but
withdrew
again
suddenly
to
the
sidewalk
inside
stickney
was
whistling
cheerily
and
assorting
his
knives
illustration
eight
cents
worth
of
something
finally
horace
went
desperately
forward
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
shop
his
head
hung
low
stickney
stopped
whistling
hello
young
man
he
cried
what
brings
you
here
illustration
his
head
hung
low
horace
halted
but
said
nothing
he
swung
one
foot
to
and
fro
over
the
floor
stickney
had
placed
his
two
fat
hands
palms
downward
and
wide
apart
on
the
table
in
the
attitude
of
a
butcher
facing
a
customer
but
now
he
straightened
here
he
said
what
wrong
what
wrong
kid
nothin
answered
horace
huskily
he
labored
for
a
moment
with
something
in
his
throat
and
afterwards
added
i
run
away
and
run
away
shouted
stickney
run
away
from
what
who
from
home
answered
horace
i
do
like
it
there
any
more
i
he
had
arranged
an
oration
to
win
the
sympathy
of
the
butcher
he
had
prepared
a
table
setting
forth
the
merits
of
his
case
in
the
most
logical
fashion
but
it
was
as
if
the
wind
had
been
knocked
out
of
his
mind
i
run
away
i
stickney
reached
an
enormous
hand
over
the
array
of
beef
and
firmly
grappled
the
emigrant
then
he
swung
himself
to
horace
side
his
face
was
stretched
with
laughter
and
he
playfully
shook
his
prisoner
come
come
come
what
dashed
nonsense
is
this
run
away
hey
run
away
whereupon
the
child
spirit
found
vent
in
howls
come
come
said
stickney
busily
never
mind
now
never
mind
you
just
come
along
with
me
it
be
all
right
i
fix
it
never
you
mind
five
minutes
later
the
butcher
with
a
great
ulster
over
his
apron
was
leading
the
boy
homeward
at
the
very
threshold
horace
raised
his
last
flag
of
pride
no
no
he
sobbed
i
do
want
to
i
do
want
to
go
in
there
he
braced
his
foot
against
the
step
and
made
a
very
respectable
resistance
now
horace
cried
the
butcher
he
thrust
open
the
door
with
a
bang
hello
there
across
the
dark
kitchen
the
door
to
the
opened
and
aunt
martha
appeared
you
found
him
she
screamed
we
come
to
make
a
call
roared
the
butcher
at
the
entrance
to
the
a
silence
fell
upon
them
all
upon
a
couch
horace
saw
his
mother
lying
limp
pale
as
death
her
eyes
gleaming
with
pain
there
was
an
electric
pause
before
she
swung
a
waxen
hand
towards
horace
my
child
she
murmured
tremulously
whereupon
the
sinister
person
addressed
with
a
prolonged
wail
of
grief
and
joy
ran
to
her
with
speed
oh
she
was
not
able
to
speak
in
a
known
tongue
as
she
folded
him
in
her
weak
arms
illustration
oh
aunt
martha
turned
defiantly
upon
the
butcher
because
her
face
betrayed
her
she
was
crying
she
made
a
gesture
half
military
half
feminine
wo
you
have
a
glass
of
our
stickney
we
make
it
ourselves
