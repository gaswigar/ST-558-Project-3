which

country
house
sir
roger
name
occurs
in
some
seventeen
other
papers
but
in
these
he
either
receives
only
passing
mention
or
is
introduced
as
a
speaker
in
conversations
where
the
real
interest
is
the
subject
under
discussion
in
these
his
character
is
well
maintained
as
for
example
at
the
meeting
of
the
club
described
in
where
he
warns
the
spectator
not
to
meddle
with
country
squires
but
they
add
no
traits
to
the
portrait
we
already
have
of
him
no
is
included
because
it
arises
naturally
out
of
no
and
illustrates
the
relation
between
the
town
and
country
no
has
been
omitted
because
it
was
condemned
by
addison
as
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
sir
roger
together
with
no
which
is
an
unconvincing
attempt
to
reconcile
it
with
the
whole
scheme
some
of
the
papers
have
been
slightly
abridged
where
they
would
not
be
acceptable
to
the

introduction
it
is
necessary
to
study
the
work
of
joseph
addison
in
close
relation
to
the
time
in
which
he
lived
for
he
was
a
true
child
of
his
century
and
even
in
his
most
distinguishing
qualities
he
was
not
so
much
in
opposition
to
its
ideas
as
in
advance
of
them
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
a
very
period
the
dreamers
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
grown
into
practical
men
the
enthusiasts
of
the
century
before
had
sobered
down
into
reasonable
beings
we
no
longer
have
the
wealth
of
detail
the
love
of
stories
the
delight
in
the
concrete
for
its
own
sake
of
the
chaucerian
and
elizabethan
children
these
men
seek
for
what
is
typical
instead
of
enjoying
what
is
detailed
argue
and
illustrate
instead
of
telling
stories
observe
instead
of
romancing
captain
sentry
himself
with
great
gallantry
in
several
sieges
footnote
but
the
spectator
does
not
care
for
them
as
chaucer
cares
for
the
battlefields
of
his
knight
might
recount
many
tales
touching
on
many
points
in
our
speculations
and
no
child
and
no
elizabethan
would
refrain
from
doing
so
but
the
spectator
will
not
out
of
the
occurrences
of
common
life
but
assert
it
as
a
general
observation
footnote
he
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
his
age
too
in
the
intensely
rational
view
which
he
takes
of
ghosts
footnote
and
witches
footnote
for
it
was
a
period
in
which
men
cared
very
little
for
things
which
eye
hath
not
seen
in
his
use
of
mottoes
again
which
are
deliberately
sought
illustrations
for
his
papers
footnote
and
not
the
sparks
which
have
fired
his
train
of
thought
he
is
typical
of
the
period
of
in
which
men
amuse
themselves
with
such
academic
pastimes
addison
is
the
very
antipodes
of
the
kind
of
man
who
t
have
his
sails
fill
with
a
lusty
wind
even
till
his
tremble
his
masts
crack
remarks
soberly
that
is
very
unhappy
for
a
man
to
be
born
in
such
a
stormy
and
tempestuous
season
footnote
he
may
not
have
been
a
great
poet
but
he
was
an
exquisite
critic
of
life
he
shared
his
contemporaries
lack
of
enthusiasm
but
he
possessed
a
fine
discrimination
and
those
less
practical
more
irresponsible
qualities
would
have
been
merely
an
incumbrance
to
the
apostle
of
good
sense
and
moderation
for
when
men
are
young
they
are
much
occupied
with
the
framing
of
ideals
and
the
search
after
absolute
truth
as
they
grow
older
they
generally
become
more
practical
they
accept
more
or
less
the
idea
of
compromise
and
make
the
best
of
things
as
they
are
or
as
they
may
be
made
the
age
being
vicious
addison
did
not
betake
himself
to
a
monastery
or
urge
others
to
do
so
he
tried
to
mend
its
morals
this
was
a
difficult
task
the
puritans
during
their
supremacy
had
imposed
their
own
severity
on
others
and
now
the
court
party
was
revenging
itself
by
indulging
in
extreme
licentiousness
its
amusements
were
cruel
and
vicious
and
the
puritans
did
nothing
to
improve
them
but
denounced
them
altogether
and
held
themselves
aloof
it
was
addison
task
to
refine
the
taste
of
his
contemporaries
and
to
widen
their
outlook
so
that
the
puritan
and
the
man
of
the
world
might
find
a
common
ground
on
which
to
meet
and
to
learn
each
from
the
other
it
was
his
endeavour
enliven
morality
with
wit
and
to
temper
wit
with
morality
till
i
have
recovered
them
out
of
that
desperate
state
of
vice
and
folly
into
which
the
age
is
fallen
footnote
it
was
a
happy
thing
for
that
and
for
all
succeeding
ages
that
a
man
of
addison
character
and
genius
was
ready
to
undertake
the
work
he
was
well
versed
in
the
pleasures
of
society
and
letters
but
his
delicate
taste
could
not
be
gratified
by
the
ordinary
amusements
of
the
town
he
treated
life
as
an
art
capable
of
affording
the
artist
abundant
pleasure
but
he
recognized
goodness
as
a
necessary
condition
of
this
pleasure
he
was
the
most
popular
man
of
his
day
even
swift
said
that
if
addison
had
wished
to
be
king
people
could
hardly
have
refused
him
footnote
to
october
and
the
qualities
which
endeared
him
to
his
friends
were
exactly
of
the
kind
to
enable
him
to
hold
the
mean
between
the
bigots
and
the
butterflies
and
to
dictate
without
giving
offence
for
they
were
humanity
and
humour
moderation
of
character
judgment
and
a
most
sensitive
tact
his
qualities
and
his
limitations
alike
appear
in
the
for
example
he
tells
us
that
he
wishes
that
country
clergymen
would
borrow
the
sermons
of
great
divines
and
devote
all
their
own
efforts
to
acquiring
a
good
elocution
footnote
here
we
detect
the
practical
moralist
and
the
man
who
likes
a
thing
good
of
its
kind
but
not
the
enthusiast
he
upholds
the
observance
of
sunday
on
account
of
its
social
influences
rather
than
for
its
religious
meaning
footnote
famous
argument
against
the
abolition
of
christianity
is
only
a
satirical
exaggeration
of
this
position
the
virtues
commended
in
the
are
those
which
make
for
the
of
society
good
sense
and
dignity
moderation
and
a
sense
of
fitness
kindness
and
generosity
they
are
to
be
practised
with
an
eye
to
their
consequences
even
virtues
must
not
be
allowed
to
run
wild
modesty
is
in
itself
a
commendable
quality
but
in
captain
sentry
it
becomes
a
fault
because
it
interferes
with
his
advancement
footnote
the
great
function
of
goodness
is
to
promote
happiness
when
it
ceases
to
do
this
it
ceases
to
be
goodness
but
the
greatest
hindrance
that
an
enthusiastic
temperament
would
have
presented
to
addison
work
is
that
it
would
have
spoilt
his
method
his
aim
he
declared
roundly
to
be
advancement
of
the
public
weal
footnote
but
he
did
not
prosecute
it
in
the
usual
way
man
he
says
be
learned
without
talking
sentences
footnote
he
saw
much
evil
and
he
laughed
at
it
he
has
tried
he
tells
us
to
nothing
ridiculous
that
is
not
in
some
measure
criminal
footnote
an
enthusiast
could
never
have
met

with
laughter
unless

the
corrosive
laughter
of

perfectly
frank
and
humane

whig

has
given
us
a
picture
of
the
tory
sir
roger
which
has
been
compared
to
the
portrait
of
our
friend
pickwick
sir
roger
put
to
silence
and
confusion
by
the
perversity
of
the
widow

her
confidant

congratulating
himself
on
having
been
called
tamest
and
most
humane
of
all
the
brutes

seeking
to
be
reassured

no
trace

showed
through

artful

inviting
the
guide
to
the
abbey
to
visit
him
at
his
lodgings
in
order
to
continue
their
conversation

by
the
discourtesy

elwin
and
a
characteristic
appearance
of
simplicity
which
never
cease
to
delight
us
this
was
the
man
and
he
found
the
instrument
ready
to
his
hand
there
was
now
a
large
educated
class
in
circumstances
sufficiently
prosperous
to
leave
them
some
leisure
for
society
and
its
enjoyments
the
peers
and
the
country
squires
were
reinforced
by
the
professional
men
merchants
and
traders
the
political
revolution
of
had
added
greatly
to
the
freedom
of
the
citizens
the
cessation
of
the
civil
war
the
increased
importance
of
the
colonies
the
development
of
native
industries
and
the
impulse
given
to
and
by
the
settlement
of
flemish
and
huguenot
workmen
in
the
seventeenth
century
had
encouraged
trade
and
the
establishment

been
favourable

footnote
addison
realized
that
it
is
the
way
in
which
men
employ
their
leisure
which
really
stamps
their
character
so
he
provided
with
morality
for
their
reading
and
attempted
through
their
reading
to
refine
their
taste
and
conversation
at
the
theatre
the
club
and
the
dunton
steele
and
defoe
had
modified
the
periodical
literature
of
the
day
by
adding
to
the
newspapers
essays
on
various
subjects
the
aim
of
the
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
but
it
had
certain
disadvantages
the
press
censorship
had
been
abolished
in
but
newspapers
were
excepted
from
the
general
freedom
of
the
press
a
more
important
disadvantage
lay
in
the
character
of
steele
who
did
not
possess
the
balance
and
moderation
required
to
edit
such
an
organ
unlike
addison
he
was
not
a
true
son
of
his
century
he
was
enthusiastic
and
impulsive
fertile
in
invention
and
sensitive
to
emotion
his
tenderness
and
pathos
reach
heights
and
depths
that
addison
never
touches
but
he
has
not
addison
fine
perception
of
events
and
motives
on
the
ordinary
level
of
emotion
he
could
not
repress
his
keen
interest
sufficiently
to
treat
of
politics
in
his
paper
and
yet
remain
the
impartial
censor
so
the
was
dropped
and
the
took
its
place
this
differed
from
its
predecessors
in
appearing
every
day
instead
of
three
times
a
week
and
in
excluding
all
articles
of
news
the
machinery
of
the
club
had
been
anticipated
in
by
john
athenian
society
which
replied
to
all
questions
submitted
by
readers
in
his
paper
the
this
was
succeeded
by
the
scandal
club
of
defoe
and
the
club
of
the
which
met
at
the
trumpet
footnote
but
the
plan
of
arranging
the
whole
work
round
the
doings
of
the
club
is
a
new
departure
in
the
it
is
in
these
periodicals
that
we
first
find
the
familiar
essay
its
only
predecessors
are
such
serious
essays
as
those
of
bacon
cowley
and
temple
the
turgid
paragraphs
of
shaftesbury
the
vigorous
but
crude
and
rough
papers
of
collier
and
the
of
overbury
and
earle
these
had
always
been
entirely
typical
they
were
treated
rather
from
the
abstract
than
from
the
human
point
of
view
and
had
no
names
or
other
individualization
than
that
of
their
character
and
calling
in
some
of
the
numbers
of
the
spectator
we
still
find
these
occurring
such
as
the
character
of
will
wimble
footnote
of
the
honest
yeoman
footnote
and
of
tom
touchy
footnote
but
they
are
surrounded
by
circumstances
peculiar
to
themselves
and
so
are
much
more
highly
individualized
the
and
the
very
greatly
extended
the
range
of
and
with
it
the
flexibility
of
prose
style
it
is
this
extension
that
gives
to
them
their
modern
quality
nothing
came
amiss
fable
description
vision
gossip
literary
criticism
or
moral
essays
discussion
of
large
questions
such
as
marriage
and
education
or
of
the
smaller
social
amenities
any
subject
which
would
be
of
interest
to
a
sufficiently
large
number
of
readers
would
furnish
a
paper
as
steele
wrote
at
the
beginning
of
the
agunt
homines
nostri
libelli
farrago
different
interests
were
voiced
by
the
various
members
of
the
club
and
the
light
humorous
treatment
and
an
easy
style
attracted
a
larger
public
than
had
ever
been
reached
by
a
single
publication

appendix
iv
the
elasticity
of
the
structure
enabled
addison
to
produce
the
maximum
effect
and
to
bring
into
play
the
full
weight
of
his
character
the
nature
of
the
work
was
determined
throughout
by
its
strongly
human
interest
it
is
significant
as
standing
between
the
lifeless
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
great
development
of
the
novel
thackeray
calls
addison
most
delightful
talker
in
the
world
and
his
essays
have
precisely
the
charm
of
the
conversation
of
a
and
thoughtful
man
of
the
world
they
are
entirely
discursive
he
starts
with
a
certain
subject
and
follows
any
line
of
thought
that
occurs
to
him
if
he
thinks
of
an
anecdote
in
connexion
with
his
subject
that
goes
down
if
it
suggests
to
him
abstract
speculations
or
moral
reflections
he
gives
us
those
instead
it
is
the
capricious
chat
of
a
man
who
likes
to
talk
not
the
product
of
an
imperative
need
of
artistic
expression
it
is
significant
that
so
much
of
his
work
consists
of
gossip
about
people
this
growing
interest
in
the
individual
was
leading
up
to
the
great
eighteenth
century
novel
it
seems
to
arise
out
of
a
growing
sense
of
identity
a
stronger
interest
in
oneself
there
is
a
common
motive
at
the
root
of
our
observation
of
other
people
of
the
interest
attaching
to
ordinary
actions
presented
on
the
stage
and
of
the
fascination
of
a
reflection
or
a
portrait
of
ourselves
by
these
means
we
are
enabled
to
some
extent
to
become
detached
and
to
take
an
external
and
impersonal
view
of
ourselves
the
stage
had
already
turned
to
the
representation
of
contemporary
life
and
manners
portraiture
was
increasing
in
popularity
and
the
novel
was
on
its
way
in
the
coverley
papers
all
the
characteristic
species
of
the
are
represented
except
the
allegory
and
the
essays
in
literary
criticism
steele
who
was
always
full
of
projects
and
swift
and
spontaneous
in
invention
wrote
the
initial
description
of
the
club
members
and
the
characters
were
sustained
by
the
two
friends
with
wonderful
consistency
apparently
each
was
mainly
responsible
for
a
certain
number
of
the
characters
and
sir
roger
was
really
the
property
of
addison
but
no
one
person
was
strictly
monopolized
by
either
the
papers
were
written
independently
but
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
two
authors
had
an
identical
conception
of
their
characters
it
is
true
that
the
singularity
of
sir
roger
behaviour
described
by
steele
in
the
first
draft
of
his
character
is
very
lightly
touched
in
subsequent
papers
and
that
judging
by
the
simplicity
of
his
conduct
in
town
he
has
forgotten
very
completely
the
gentleman
footnote
period
of
his
life
when
like
master
shallow
he
the
chimes
at
midnight
but
these
are
insignificant
details
since
sir
roger
belongs
to
addison
it
follows
naturally
that
in
the
present
selection
addison
share
compared
with
steele
is
larger
in
proportion
than
in
the
complete
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
lose
sight
of
the
importance
of
steele
part
of
the
work
addison
was
the
greater
artist
and
the
balance
and
shapeliness
of
his
style
enhances
the
effect
of
his
thought
and
judgment
but
we
should
be
no
less
sorry
to
relinquish
steele
headlong
directness
and
warmth
of
feeling
the
humorous
character
sketches
of
sir
roger
ancestors
footnote
are
his
and
his
the
passage
at
arms
between
the
quaker
and
the
soldier
in
the
coach
the
delightful
soldier
of
whose
remark
the
tells
us
was
followed
by
a
vain
laugh
of
his
own
and
a
deep
silence
of
all
the
rest
of
the
company
i
had
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
fall
fast
asleep
which
i
did
with
all
speed
footnote
his
too
is
the
charming
little
idyll
of
the
huntsman
and
his
betty
who
fears
that
her
love
will
drown
himself
in
a
stream
he
can
jump
across
footnote
and
the
whole
fragrant
story
of
sir
thirty
years
attachment
to
the
widow
footnote
but
above
all
we
must
not
overlook
the
fact
that
without
steele
as
he
himself
says
in
his
dedication
to
addison
would
never
have
brought
himself
to
give
to
the
world
these
familiar
informal
essays
addison
was
naturally
both
cautious
and
shy
the
mask
which
steele
invented
lent
him
just
the
security
which
he
needed
and
the
endures
as
the
monument
of
a
great
friendship
a
memorial
such
as
steele
had
always
desired
footnote
steele
himself
explained
the
other
advantages
of
the
disguise
is
much
more
difficult
to
converse
with
the
world
in
a
real
than
in
a
personated
character
he
says
both
because
the
moral
theory
of
a
man
whose
identity
is
known
is
exposed
to
the
commentary
of
his
life
and
because
fictitious
person
might
assume
a
mock
authority
without
being
looked
upon
as
vain
and
conceited
footnote
it
is
to
the
influence
of
this
mask
that
much
of
the
complacent
superiority
which
has
been
attributed
to
addison
may
be
referred
one
nothing
to
do
with
men
passions
and
interests
footnote
one

watch
the
manners
and
behaviour
of
my
countrymen

to
extirpate
anything

modesty
and

footnote
such
a
censor
was
bound
to
place
himself
on
a
pinnacle
above
the
passions
and
foibles
which
he
was
to
rebuke
yet
occasionally
addison
does
appear
a
trifle
pope
indictment
of
his
character
in
the
person
of
atticus
can
not
be
entirely
set
aside
his
creed
as
implied
in
esteems
the
welfare
of
man
as
the
prime
end
of
a
fostering
providence
and
such
an
opinion
as
this
held
steadily
without
doubt
or
struggle
would
tend
to
give
a
man
a
strong
sense
of
his
own
importance
the
superiority
of
his
attitude
to
women
which
however
does
not
appear
in
the
coverley
papers
is
attributable
partly
to
his
office
of
censor
and
partly
to
their
position
at
the
time
this
sort
of
condescension
appears
most
distinctly
in
his
treatment
of
animals
he
is
far
more
humane
in
his
feeling
for
them
than
are
the
majority
of
his
contemporaries
but
although
he
likes
to
moralize
over
sir
poultry
footnote
he
really
looks
down
on
them
from
the
elevation
which
a
reasonable
being
must
possess
over
the
creatures
of
instinct
yet
how
does
he
know
so
certainly
that
instinct
is
actually
inferior
to
reason
addison
is
essentially
a
townsman
and
his
treatment
of
nature
is
always
cold
the
one
passage
in
these
papers
which
evinces
a
genuine
love
of
the
country
is
steele
description
of
his
enjoyment
when
he
is
strolling
in
the
widow
grove
he
is
with
the
murmur
of
waters
the
whisper
of
breezes
the
singing
of
birds
and
whether
i
looked
up
to
the
heavens
down
on
the
earth
or
turned
to
the
prospects
around
me
still
struck
with
new
sense
of
pleasure
footnote
the
style
of
the
two
writers
reflects
the
qualities
of
their
minds
addison
writing
is
fluent
easy
and
lucid
he
wrote
and
corrected
with
great
care
and
his
words
very
closely
express
his
thought
landor
speaks
of
his
prose
as
a
current
of
delight
and
johnson
in
an
often
quoted
passage
calls
it
model
of
the
middle
style
always
equable
and
always
easy
without
glowing
words
or
pointed
sentences
his
page
is
always
luminous
but
never
blazes
in
unexpected
splendour
he
is
never
feeble
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
energetic
whoever
wishes
to
attain
an
english
style
familiar
but
not
coarse
and
elegant
but
not
ostentatious
must
give
his
days
and
nights
to
the
volumes
of
addison
steele
was
a
far
more
rapid
writer
and
even
grammatical
faults
are
not
infrequent
in
his
papers
he
explicitly
declares
that
purity
and
correctness
were
not
so
much
my
purpose
as
in
any
intelligible
manner
as
i
could
to
rally
all
those
singularities
of
human
life
which
obstruct
anything
that
was
really
good
and
great
footnote
dedication
to
his
style
varies
with
his
mood
and
with
the
degree
of
his
interest
occasionally
it
reaches
the
simple
rhythmic
prose
of
the
passage
quoted
above
but
generally
it
is
somewhat
abrupt
and
a
little
toneless
but
now
and
again
we
find
the
splendour
in
which
addison
is
wanting
in
phrases
like
covered
indigence
a
magnificent
poverty
footnote
or
in
the
sparkling
antitheses
of
sir
roger
description
of
his
ancestors
footnote
yet
steele
claim
on
our
admiration
rests
not
on
the
quality
of
his
style
but
as
john
forster
has
said
on
soul
of
a
sincere
man
shining
through
it
all
the
influence
of
the
was
incalculable

succeeded
in
his
principal
object

be
ambitious

have
it
said
of
me
that
i
have
brought
philosophy
out
of
closets
and
libraries
schools
and
colleges
to
dwell
in
clubs
and
assemblies
at
and
in
and
that
i
have
produced
writings
as
tend
to
the
wearing
out
of
ignorance
passion
and
prejudice
footnote
a
glance
at
the
social
and
literary
history
of
the
next
thirty
or
forty
years
will
reveal
how
fully
this
wish
was
accomplished
it
is
true
that
folly
and
vice
have
not
yet
been
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
but
the
turned
the
tide
of
public
opinion
against
them
the
fashionable
ideal
was
reversed
virtue
became
admirable
and
though
vice
could
not
be
destroyed
it
was
no
longer
suffered
to
plume
itself
in
the
eyes
of
the
world

delivered
virtue
from
its
position
of
contempt
and
up

immoral
man

the
object
of
derision

the

also
acquired
an
incidental
value

the
passage

at
this
in
his
citations

a

other
particulars
of
the
like
nature
that
conduce
very
much
to
the
right
understanding
of
an
author
to
gratify
this
curiosity
which
is
so
natural
to
a
reader
i
design
this
paper
and
my
next
as
prefatory
discourses
to
my
following
writings
and
shall
give
some
account
in
them
of
the
several
persons
that
are
engaged
in
this
work
as
the
chief
trouble
of
compiling
digesting
and
correcting
will
fall
to
my
share
i
must
do
myself
the
justice
to
open
the
work
with
my
own
history
i
was
born
to
a
small
hereditary
estate
which
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
village
where
it
lies
was
bounded
by
the
same
hedges
and
ditches
in
the
conqueror
time
that
it
is
at
present
and
has
been
delivered
down
from
father
to
son
whole
and
entire
without
the
loss
or
acquisition
of
a
single
field
or
meadow
during
the
space
of
six
hundred
years
there
runs
a
story
in
the
family
that
when
my
mother
was
gone
with
child
of
me
about
three
months
she
dreamt
that
she
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
judge
whether
this
might
proceed
from
a
which
was
then
depending
in
the
family
or
my
father
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
can
not
determine
for
i
am
not
so
vain
as
to
think
it
presaged
any
dignity
that
i
should
arrive
at
in
my
future
life
though
that
was
the
interpretation
which
the
neighbourhood
put
upon
it
the
gravity
of
my
behaviour
at
my
very
first
appearance
in
the
world
and
all
the
time
that
i
sucked
seemed
to
favour
my
mother
dream
for
as
she
has
often
told
me
i
threw
away
my
rattle
before
i
was
two
months
old
and
would
not
make
use
of
my
coral
until
they
had
taken
away
the
bells
from
it
as
for
the
rest
of
my
infancy
there
being
nothing
in
it
remarkable
i
shall
pass
it
over
in
silence
i
find
that
during
my
nonage
i
had
the
reputation
of
a
very
sullen
youth
but
was
always
a
favourite
of
my
schoolmaster
who
used
to
say
my
parts
were
solid
and
would
wear
i
had
not
been
long
at
the
university
before
i
distinguished
myself
by
a
most
profound
silence
for
during
the
space
of
eight
years
excepting
in
the
public
exercises
of
the
college
i
scarce
uttered
the
quantity
of
an
hundred
words
and
indeed
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
spoke
three
sentences
together
in
my
whole
life
whilst
i
was
in
this
learned
body
i
applied
myself
with
so
much
diligence
to
my
studies
that
there
are
very
few
celebrated
books
either
in
the
learned
or
the
modern
tongues
which
i
am
not
acquainted
with
upon
the
death
of
my
father
i
was
resolved
to
travel
into
foreign
countries
and
therefore
left
the
university
with
the
character
of
an
odd
unaccountable
fellow
that
had
a
great
deal
of
learning
if
i
would
but
shew
it
an
insatiable
thirst
after
knowledge
carried
me
into
all
the
countries
of
in
which
there
was
any
thing
new
or
strange
to
be
seen
nay
to
such
a
degree
was
my
curiosity
raised
that
having
read
the
controversies
of
some
great
men
concerning
the
antiquities
of
i
made
a
voyage
to
on
purpose
to
take
the
measure
of
a
pyramid
and
as
soon
as
i
had
set
myself
right
in
that
particular
returned
to
my
native
country
with
great
satisfaction
i
have
passed
my
latter
years
in
this
city
where
i
am
frequently
seen
in
most
public
places
though
there
are
not
above
half
a
dozen
of
my
select
friends
that
know
me
of
whom
my
next
paper
shall
give
a
more
particular
account
there
is
no
place
of
general
resort
wherein
i
do
not
often
make
my
appearance
sometimes
i
am
seen
thrusting
my
head
into
a
round
of
politicians
at
and
listening
with
great
attention
to
the
narratives
that
are
made
in
those
little
circular
audiences
sometimes
i
smoke
a
pipe
at
and
whilst
i
seem
attentive
to
nothing
but
the
overhear
the
conversation
of
every
table
in
the
room
i
appear
on
nights
at
and
sometimes
join
the
little
committee
of
politics
in
the
as
one
who
comes
there
to
hear
and
improve
my
face
is
likewise
very
well
known
at
the
the
and
in
the
theatres
both
of
and
the
i
have
been
taken
for
a
merchant
upon
the
for
above
these
ten
years
and
sometimes
pass
for
a
in
the
assembly
of
at
in
short
wherever
i
see
a
cluster
of
people
i
always
mix
with
them
though
i
never
open
my
lips
but
in
my
own
club
thus
i
live
in
the
world
rather
as
a
spectator
of
mankind
than
as
one
of
the
species
by
which
means
i
have
made
myself
a
speculative
statesman
soldier
merchant
and
artisan
without
ever
meddling
with
any
practical
part
in
life
i
am
very
well
versed
in
the
theory
of
a
husband
or
a
father
and
can
discern
the
errors
in
the
oeconomy
business
and
diversion
of
others
better
than
those
who
are
engaged
in
them
as
discover
blots
which
are
apt
to
escape
those
who
are
in
the
game
i
never
espoused
any
party
with
violence
and
am
resolved
to
observe
an
exact
neutrality
between
the
whigs
and
tories
unless
i
shall
be
forced
to
declare
myself
by
the
hostilities
of
either
side
in
short
i
have
acted
in
all
the
parts
of
my
life
as
a
which
is
the
character
i
intend
to
preserve
in
this
paper
i
have
given
the
reader
just
so
much
of
my
history
and
character
as
to
let
him
see
i
am
not
altogether
unqualified
for
the
business
i
have
undertaken
as
for
other
particulars
in
my
life
and
adventures
i
shall
insert
them
in
following
papers
as
i
shall
see
occasion
in
the
mean
time
when
i
consider
how
much
i
have
seen
read
and
heard
i
begin
to
blame
my
own
taciturnity
and
since
i
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
communicate
the
fulness
of
my
heart
in
speech
i
am
resolved
to
do
it
in
writing
and
to
print
myself
out
if
possible
before
i
die
i
have
been
often
told
by
my
friends
that
it
is
pity
so
many
useful
discoveries
which
i
have
made
should
be
in
the
possession
of
a
silent
man
for
this
reason
therefore
i
shall
publish
a
of
thoughts
every
morning
for
the
benefit
of
my
contemporaries
and
if
i
can
any
way
contribute
to
the
diversion
or
improvement
of
the
country
in
which
i
live
i
shall
leave
it
when
i
am
summoned
out
of
it
with
the
secret
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
i
have
not
lived
in
vain
there
are
three
very
material
points
which
i
have
not
spoken
to
in
this
paper
and
which
for
several
important
reasons
i
must
keep
to
myself
at
least
for
some
time
i
mean
an
account
of
my
name
my
age
and
my
lodgings
i
must
confess
i
would
gratify
my
reader
in
any
thing
that
is
reasonable
but
as
for
these
three
particulars
though
i
am
sensible
they
might
tend
very
much
to
the
embellishment
of
my
paper
i
can
not
yet
come
to
a
resolution
of
communicating
them
to
the
public
they
would
indeed
draw
me
out
of
that
obscurity
which
i
have
enjoyed
for
many
years
and
expose
me
in
public
places
to
several
salutes
and
civilities
which
have
been
always
very
disagreeable
to
me
for
the
greatest
pain
i
can
suffer
is
the
being
talked
to
and
being
stared
at
it
is
for
this
reason
likewise
that
i
keep
my
complexion
and
dress
as
very
great
secrets
though
it
is
not
impossible
but
i
may
make
discoveries
of
both
in
the
progress
of
the
work
i
have
undertaken
after
having
been
thus
particular
upon
myself
i
shall
in
paper
give
an
account
of
those
gentlemen
who
are
concerned
with
me
in
this
work
for
as
i
have
before
intimated
a
plan
of
it
is
laid
and
concerted
as
all
other
matters
of
importance
are
in
a
club
however
as
my
friends
have
engaged
me
to
stand
in
the
front
those
who
have
a
mind
to
correspond
with
me
may
direct
their
letters
to
the
spectator
at
in
for
i
must
further
acquaint
the
reader
that
though
our
club
meets
only
on
and
we
have
appointed
a
committee
to
sit
every
night
for
the
inspection
of
all
such
papers
as
may

the
first
of
our
society
is
a
gentleman
of
of
ancient
descent
a
baronet
his
name
sir
roger
de
coverley
his
grandfather
was
inventor
of
that
famous
which
is
called
after
him
all
who
know
that
shire
are
very
well
acquainted
with
the
parts
and
merits
of
sir
roger
he
is
a
gentleman
that
is
very
singular
in
his
behaviour
but
his
singularities
proceed
from
his
good
sense
and
are
contradictions
to
the
manners
of
the
world
only
as
he
thinks
the
world
is
in
the
wrong
however
this
humour
creates
him
no
enemies
for
he
does
nothing
with
sourness
or
obstinacy
and
his
being
unconfined
to
modes
and
forms
makes
him
but
the
readier
and
more
capable
to
please
and
oblige
all
who
know
him
when
he
is
in
town
he
lives
in
it
is
said
he
keeps
himself
a
bachelor
by
reason
he
was
crossed
in
love
by
a
perverse
beautiful
widow
of
the
next
county
to
him
before
this
disappointment
sir
roger
was
what
you
call
a
fine
gentleman
had
often
supped
with
my
lord
and
sir
fought
a
duel
upon
his
first
coming
to
town
and
kicked
bully
in
a
public
for
calling
him
youngster
but
being
by
the
widow
he
was
very
serious
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
though
his
temper
being
naturally
jovial
he
at
last
got
over
it
he
grew
careless
of
himself
and
never
dressed
afterwards
he
continues
to
wear
a
coat
and
doublet
of
the
same
cut
that
were
in
fashion
at
the
time
of
his
repulse
which
in
his
merry
humours
he
tells
us
has
been
in
and
out
twelve
times
since
he
first
wore
it
he
is
now
in
his
year
chearful
gay
and
hearty
keeps
a
good
house
both
in
town
and
country
a
great
lover
of
mankind
but
there
is
such
a
mirthful
cast
in
his
behaviour
that
he
is
rather
beloved
than
esteemed
his
tenants
grow
rich
his
servants
look
satisfied
all
the
young
women
profess
love
to
him
and
the
young
men
are
glad
of
his
company
when
he
comes
into
a
house
he
calls
the
servants
by
their
names
and
talks
all
the
way
upstairs
to
a
visit
i
must
not
omit
that
sir
roger
is
a
justice
of
the
that
he
fills
the
chair
at
a
with
great
abilities
and
three
months
ago
gained
universal
applause
by
explaining
a
passage
in
the
the
gentleman
next
in
esteem
and
authority
among
us
is
another
bachelor
who
is
a
member
of
the
a
man
of
great
probity
wit
and
understanding
but
he
has
chosen
his
place
of
residence
rather
to
obey
the
direction
of
an
old
humoursome
father
than
in
pursuit
of
his
own
inclinations
he
was
placed
there
to
study
the
laws
of
the
land
and
is
the
most
learned
of
any
of
the
house
in
those
of
the
stage
and
are
much
better
understood
by
him
than
or
the
father
sends
up
every
post
questions
relating
to
leases
and
tenures
in
the
neighbourhood
all
which
questions
he
agrees
with
an
attorney
to
answer
and
take
care
of
in
the
lump
he
is
studying
the
passions
themselves
when
he
should
be
inquiring
into
the
debates
among
men
which
arise
from
them
he
knows
the
argument
of
each
of
the
orations
of
and
but
not
one
case
in
the
reports
of
our
own
courts
no
one
ever
took
him
for
a
fool
but
none
except
his
intimate
friends
know
he
has
a
great
deal
of
wit
this
turn
makes
him
at
once
both
disinterested
and
agreeable
as
few
of
his
thoughts
are
drawn
from
business
they
are
most
of
them
fit
for
conversation
his
taste
of
books
is
a
little
too
just
for
the
age
he
lives
in
he
has
read
all
but
approves
of
very
few
his
familiarity
with
the
customs
manners
actions
and
writings
of
the
ancients
makes
him
a
very
delicate
observer
of
what
occurs
to
him
in
the
present
world
he
is
an
excellent
critick
and
the
time
of
the
play
is
his
hour
of
business
exactly
at
five
he
passes
through
crosses
through
and
takes
a
turn
at
until
the
play
begins
he
has
his
shoes
rubbed
and
his
periwig
powdered
at
the
as
you
go
into
the
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
audience
when
he
is
at
a
play
for
the
actors
have
an
ambition
to
please
him
the
person
of
next
consideration
is
sir
andrew
freeport
a
merchant
of
great
eminence
in
the
city
of
a
person
of
indefatigable
industry
strong
reason
and
great
experience
his
notions
of
trade
are
noble
and
generous
and
as
every
rich
man
has
usually
some
sly
way
of
jesting
which
would
make
no
great
figure
were
he
not
a
rich
man
he
calls
the
sea
the
he
is
acquainted
with
commerce
in
all
its
parts
and
will
tell
you
that
it
is
a
stupid
and
barbarous
way
to
extend
dominion
by
arms
for
true
power
is
to
be
got
by
arts
and
industry
he
will
often
argue
that
if
this
part
of
our
trade
were
well
cultivated
we
should
gain
from
one
nation
and
if
another
from
another
i
have
heard
him
prove
that
diligence
makes
more
lasting
acquisitions
than
valour
and
that
sloth
has
ruined
more
nations
than
the
sword
he
abounds
in
several
frugal
maxims
amongst
which
the
greatest
favourite
is
penny
saved
is
a
penny
got
a
general
trader
of
good
sense
is
pleasanter
company
than
a
general
scholar
and
sir
andrew
having
a
natural
unaffected
eloquence
the
perspicuity
of
his
discourse
gives
the
same
pleasure
that
wit
would
in
another
man
he
has
made
his
fortunes
himself
and
says
that
may
be
richer
than
other
kingdoms
by
as
plain
methods
as
he
himself
is
richer
than
other
men
though
at
the
same
time
i
can
say
this
of
him
that
there
is
not
a
point
in
the
compass
but
blows
home
a
ship
in
which
he
is
an
owner
next
to
sir
andrew
in
the
sits
captain
sentry
a
gentleman
of
great
courage
good
understanding
but
invincible
modesty
he
is
one
of
those
that
deserve
very
well
but
are
very
aukward
at
putting
their
talents
within
the
observation
of
such
as
should
take
notice
of
them
he
was
some
years
a
captain
and
behaved
himself
with
great
gallantry
in
several
engagements
and
at
several
sieges
but
having
a
small
estate
of
his
own
and
being
next
heir
to
sir
roger
he
has
quitted
a
way
of
life
in
which
no
man
can
rise
suitably
to
his
merit
who
is
not
something
of
a
courtier
as
well
as
a
soldier
i
have
heard
him
often
lament
that
in
a
profession
where
merit
is
placed
in
so
conspicuous
a
view
impudence
should
get
the
better
of
modesty
when
he
has
talked
to
this
purpose
i
never
heard
him
make
a
sour
expression
but
frankly
confess
that
he
left
the
world
because
he
was
not
fit
for
it
a
strict
honesty
and
an
even
regular
behaviour
are
in
themselves
obstacles
to
him
that
must
press
through
crowds
who
endeavour
at
the
same
end
with
himself
the
favour
of
a
commander
he
will
however
in
his
way
of
talk
excuse
generals
for
not
disposing
according
to
men
desert
or
inquiring
into
it
for
says
he
that
great
man
who
has
a
mind
to
help
me
has
as
many
to
break
through
to
come
at
me
as
i
have
to
come
at
him
therefore
he
will
conclude
that
the
man
who
would
make
a
figure
especially
in
a
military
way
must
get
over
all
false
modesty
and
assist
his
patron
against
the
importunity
of
other
pretenders
by
a
proper
assurance
in
his
own
vindication
he
says
it
is
a
civil
cowardice
to
be
backward
in
asserting
what
you
ought
to
expect
as
it
is
a
military
fear
to
be
slow
in
attacking
when
it
is
your
duty
with
this
candour
does
the
gentleman
speak
of
himself
and
others
the
same
frankness
runs
through
all
his
conversation
the
military
part
of
his
life
has
furnished
him
with
many
adventures
in
the
relation
of
which
he
is
very
agreeable
to
the
company
for
he
is
never
overbearing
though
accustomed
to
command
men
in
the
utmost
degree
below
him
nor
ever
too
obsequious
from
an
habit
of
obeying
men
highly
above
him
but
that
our
society
may
not
appear
a
set
of
humourists
unacquainted
with
the
gallantries
and
pleasures
of
the
age
we
have
among
us
the
gallant
will
honeycomb
a
gentleman
who
according
to
his
years
should
be
in
the
decline
of
his
life
but
having
ever
been
very
careful
of
his
person
and
always
had
a
very
easy
fortune
time
has
made
but
a
very
little
impression
either
by
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
or
traces
in
his
brain
his
person
is
well
turned
of
a
good
height
he
is
very
ready
at
that
sort
of
discourse
with
which
men
usually
entertain
women
he
has
all
his
life
dressed
very
well
and
remembers
habits
as
others
do
men
he
can
smile
when
one
speaks
to
him
and
laughs
easily
he
knows
the
history
of
every
mode
and
can
inform
you
from
which
of
the
court
ladies
our
wives
and
daughters
had
this
manner
of
curling
their
hair
that
way
of
placing
their
hoods
and
whose
vanity
to
shew
her
foot
made
that
part
of
the
dress
so
short
in
such
a
year
in
a
word
all
his
conversation
and
knowledge
have
been
in
the
female
world
as
other
men
of
his
age
will
take
notice
to
you
what
such
a
minister
said
upon
such
and
such
an
occasion
he
will
tell
you
when
the
duke
of
danced
at
court
such
a
woman
was
then
smitten
another
was
taken
with
him
at
the
head
of
his
troop
in
the
in
all
these
important
relations
he
has
ever
about
the
same
time
received
a
kind
glance
or
a
blow
of
a
fan
from
some
celebrated
beauty
mother
of
the
present
lord
if
you
speak
of
a
young
commoner

said

lively
thing
in

house

starts
up

good
blood
in
his
veins
begot
him
that
rogue
cheated
me
in
that
affair
that
young
fellow
mother
used
me
more
like
a
dog
than
any
woman
i
ever
made
advances
to
this
way
of
talking
of
his
very
much
enlivens
the
conversation
among
us
of
a
more
sedate
turn
and
i
find
there
is
not
one
of
the
company
but
myself
who
rarely
speak
at
all
but
speaks
of
him
as
of
that
sort
of
man
who
is
usually
called
a
fine
gentleman
to
conclude
his
character
where
women
are
not
concerned
he
is
an
honest
worthy
man
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
am
to
account
him
whom
i
am
next
to
speak
of
as
one
of
our
company
for
he
visits
us
but
seldom
but
when
he
does
it
adds
to
every
man
else
a
new
enjoyment
of
himself
he
is
a
clergyman
a
very
philosophic
man
of
general
learning
great
sanctity
of
life
and
the
most
exact
good
breeding
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
of
a
very
weak
constitution
and
consequently
can
not
accept
of
such
cares
and
business
as
preferments
in
his
function
would
oblige
him
to
he
is
therefore
among
divines
what
a
is
among
lawyers
the
probity
of
his
mind
and
the
integrity
of
his
life
create
him
followers
as
being
eloquent
or
loud
advances
others
he
seldom
introduces
the
subject
he
speaks
upon
but
we
are
so
far
gone
in
years
that
he
observes
when
he
is
among
us
an
earnestness
to
have
him
fall
on
some
divine
topic
which
he
always
treats
with
much
authority
as
one
who
has
no
interests
in
this
world
as
one
who
is
hastening
to
the
object
of
all
his
wishes
and
conceives
hope
from
his
decays
and
infirmities
these
are
my
ordinary
companions

creech
having
often
received
an
invitation
from
my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
to
pass
away
a
month
with
him
in
the
country
i
last
week
accompanied
him
thither
and
am
settled
with
him
for
some
time
at
his
where
i
intend
to
form
several
of
my
ensuing
speculations
sir
roger
who
is
very
well
acquainted
with
my
humour
lets
me
rise
and
go
to
bed
when
i
please
dine
at
his
own
table
or
in
my
chamber
as
i
think
fit
sit
still
and
say
nothing
without
bidding
me
be
merry
when
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
come
to
see
him
he
only
shews
me
at
a
distance
as
i
have
been
walking
in
his
fields
i
have
observed
them
stealing
a
sight
of
me
over
an
hedge
and
have
heard
the
knight
desiring
them
not
to
let
me
see
them
for
that
i
hated
to
be
stared
at
i
am
the
more
at
ease
in
sir
roger
family
because
it
consists
of
sober
and
staid
persons
for
as
the
knight
is
the
best
master
in
the
world
he
seldom
changes
his
servants
and
as
he
is
beloved
by
all
about
him
his
servants
never
care
for
leaving
him
by
this
means
his
domesticks
are
all
in
years
and
grown
old
with
their
master
you
would
take
his
valet
de
chambre
for
his
brother
his
butler
is
his
groom
is
one
of
the
gravest
men
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
his
coachman
has
the
looks
of
a
you
see
the
goodness
of
the
master
even
in
the
old
and
in
a
gray
pad
that
is
kept
in
the
stable
with
great
care
and
tenderness
out
of
regard
to
his
past
services
though
he
has
been
useless
for
several
years
i
could
not
but
observe
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
the
joy
that
appeared
in
the
countenance
of
these
ancient
domesticks
upon
my
arrival
at
his
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
the
sight
of
their
old
master
every
one
of
them
pressed
forward
to
do
something
for
him
and
seemed
discouraged
if
they
were
not
employed
at
the
same
time
the
good
old
knight
with
a
mixture
of
the
father
and
the
master
of
the
family
tempered
the
inquiries
after
his
own
affairs
with
several
kind
questions
relating
to
themselves
this
humanity
and
engages
every
body
to
him
so
that
when
he
is
pleasant
upon
any
of
them
all
his
family
are
in
good
humour
and
none
so
much
as
the
person
whom
he
diverts
himself
with
on
the
contrary
if
he
coughs
or
betrays
any
infirmity
of
old
age
it
is
easy
for
a
to
observe
a
secret
concern
in
the
looks
of
all
his
servants
my
worthy
friend
has
put
me
under
the
particular
care
of
his
butler
who
is
a
very
prudent
man
and
as
well
as
the
rest
of
his
wonderfully
desirous
of
pleasing
me
because
they
have
often
heard
their
master
talk
of
me
as
of
his
particular
friend
my
chief
companion
when
sir
roger
is
diverting
himself
in
the
woods
or
the
fields
is
a
very
venerable
man
who
is
ever
with
sir
roger
and
has
lived
at
his
house
in
the
nature
of
a
chaplain
above
thirty
years
this
gentleman
is
a
person
of
good
sense
and
some
learning
of
a
very
regular
life
and
obliging
conversation
he
heartily
loves
sir
roger
and
knows
that
he
is
very
much
in
the
old
knight
esteem
so
that
he
lives
in
the
family
rather
as
a
relation
than
a
dependant
i
have
observed
in
several
of
my
papers
that
my
friend
sir
roger
amidst
all
his
good
qualities
is
something
of
an
humorist
and
that
his
virtues
as
well
as
imperfections
are
as
it
were
tinged
by
a
certain
extravagance
which
makes
them
particularly
and
distinguishes
them
from
those
of
other
men
this
cast
of
mind
as
it
is
generally
very
innocent
in
itself
so
it
renders
his
conversation
highly
agreeable
and
more
delightful
than
the
same
degree
of
sense
and
virtue
would
appear
in
their
common
and
ordinary
colours
as
i
was
walking
with
him
last
night
he
asked
me
how
i
liked
the
good
man
whom
i
have
just
now
mentioned
and
without
staying
for
my
answer
told
me
that
he
was
afraid
of
being
insulted
with
latin
and
greek
at
his
own
table
for
which
reason
he
desired
a
particular
friend
of
his
at
the
university
to
find
him
out
a
clergyman
rather
of
plain
sense
than
much
learning
of
a
good
aspect
a
clear
voice
a
sociable
temper
and
if
possible
a
man
that
understood
a
little
of
my
friend
says
sir
roger
found
me
out
this
gentleman
who
besides
the
endowments
required
of
him
is
they
tell
me
a
good
scholar
though
he
does
not
show
it
i
have
given
him
the
parsonage
of
the
parish
and
because
i
know
his
value
have
settled
upon
him
a
good
annuity
for
life
if
he
outlives
me
he
shall
find
that
he
was
higher
in
my
esteem
than
perhaps
he
thinks
he
is
he
has
now
been
with
me
thirty
years
and
though
he
does
not
know
i
have
taken
notice
of
it
has
never
in
all
that
time
asked
any
thing
of
me
for
himself
though
he
is
every
day
soliciting
me
for
something
in
behalf
of
one
or
other
of
my
tenants
his
parishioners
there
has
not
been
a
lawsuit
in
the
parish
since
he
has
lived
among
them
if
any
dispute
arises
they
apply
themselves
to
him
for
the
decision
if
they
do
not
acquiesce
in
his
judgment
which
i
think
never
happened
above
once
or
twice
at
most
they
appeal
to
me
at
his
first
settling
with
me
i
made
him
a
present
of
all
the
good
sermons
which
have
been
printed
in
and
only
begged
of
him
that
every
he
would
pronounce
one
of
them
in
the
pulpit
accordingly
he
has
digested
them
into
such
a
series
that
they
follow
one
another
naturally
and
make
a
continued
system
of
practical
divinity
as
sir
roger
was
going
on
in
his
story
the
gentleman
we
were
talking
of
came
up
to
us
and
upon
the
knight
asking
him
who
preached
for
it
was
night
told
us
the
bishop
of
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
he
then
shewed
us
his
list
of
preachers
for
the
whole
year
where
i
saw
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
archbishop
bishop
with
several
living
authors
who
have
published
discourses
of
practical
divinity
i
no
sooner
saw
this
venerable
man
in
the
pulpit
but
i
very
much
approved
of
my
friend
insisting
upon
the
qualifications
of
a
good
aspect
and
a
clear
voice
for
i
was
so
charmed
with
the
gracefulness
of
his
figure
and
delivery
as
well
as
with
the
discourses
he
pronounced
that
i
think
i
never
passed
any
time
more
to
my
satisfaction
a
sermon
repeated
after
this
manner
is
like
the
composition
of
a
poet
in
the
mouth
of
a
graceful
actor
i
could
heartily
wish
that
more
of
our
would
follow
this
example
and
instead
of
wasting
their
spirits
in
laborious
compositions
of
their
own
would
endeavour
after
a
handsome
elocution
and
all
those
other
talents
that
are
proper
to
enforce
what
has
been
penned
by
greater
masters
this
would
not
only
be
more
easy
to
themselves
but
more
edifying
to
the
people

the
erected
a

and
placed
him
though
a

on
a
lasting
pedestal
to
show
that
the
way
to
honour
lies
open
indifferently
to
all
the
reception
manner
of
attendance
undisturbed
freedom
and
quiet
which
i
meet
with
here
in
the
country
has
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
i
always
had
that
the
general
corruption
of
manners
in
servants
is
owing
to
the
conduct
of
masters
the
aspect
of
every
one
in
the
family
carries
so
much
satisfaction
that
it
appears
he
knows
the
happy
lot
which
has
befallen
him
in
being
a
member
of
it
there
is
one
particular
which
i
have
seldom
seen
but
at
sir
roger
it
is
usual
in
all
other
places
that
servants
flee
from
the
parts
of
the
house
through
which
their
master
is
passing
on
the
contrary
here
they
industriously
place
themselves
in
his
way
and
it
is
on
both
sides
as
it
were
understood
as
a
visit
when
the
servants
appear
without
calling
this
proceeds
from
the
humane
and
equal
temper
of
the
man
of
the
house
who
also
perfectly
well
knows
how
to
enjoy
a
great
estate
with
such
oeconomy
as
ever
to
be
much
beforehand
this
makes
his
own
mind
untroubled
and
consequently
unapt
to
vent
peevish
expressions
or
give
passionate
or
inconsistent
orders
to
those
about
him
thus
respect
and
love
go
together
and
a
certain
cheerfulness
in
performance
of
their
duty
is
the
particular
distinction
of
the
lower
part
of
this
family
when
a
servant
is
called
before
his
master
he
does
not
come
with
an
expectation
to
hear
himself
rated
for
some
trivial
fault
threatened
to
be
stripped
or
used
with
any
other
unbecoming
language
which
mean
masters
often
give
to
worthy
servants
but
it
is
often
to
know
what
road
he
took
that
he
came
so
readily
back
according
to
order
whether
he
passed
by
such
a
ground
if
the
old
man
who
rents
it
is
in
good
health
or
whether
he
gave
sir
roger
love
to
him
or
the
like
a
man
who
preserves
a
respect
founded
on
his
benevolence
to
his
dependents
lives
rather
like
a
prince
than
a
master
in
his
family
his
orders
are
received
as
favours
rather
than
duties
and
the
distinction
of
approaching
him
is
part
of
the
reward
for
executing
what
is
commanded
by
him
there
is
another
circumstance
in
which
my
friend
excels
in
his
management
which
is
the
manner
of
rewarding
his
servants
he
has
ever
been
of
opinion
that
giving
his
cast
clothes
to
be
worn
by
valets
has
a
very
ill
effect
upon
little
minds
and
creates
a
silly
sense
of
equality
between
the
parties
in
persons
affected
only
with
outward
things
i
have
heard
him
often
pleasant
on
this
occasion
and
describe
a
young
gentleman
abusing
his
man
in
that
coat
which
a
month
or
two
before
was
the
most
pleasing
distinction
he
was
conscious
of
in
himself
he
would
turn
his
discourse
still
more
pleasantly
upon
the
ladies
bounties
of
this
kind
and
i
have
heard
him
say
he
knew
a
fine
woman
who
distributed
rewards
and
punishments
in
giving
becoming
or
unbecoming
dresses
to
her
maids
but
my
good
friend
is
above
these
little
instances
of
in
bestowing
only
trifles
on
his
servants
a
good
servant
to
him
is
sure
of
having
it
in
his
choice
very
soon
of
being
no
servant
at
all
as
i
before
observed
he
is
so
good
an
husband
and
knows
so
thoroughly
that
the
skill
of
the
purse
is
the
cardinal
virtue
of
this
life
i
say
he
knows
so
well
that
frugality
is
the
support
of
generosity
that
he
can
often
spare
a
large
fine
when
a
tenement
falls
and
give
that
settlement
to
a
good
servant
who
has
a
mind
to
go
into
the
world
or
make
a
stranger
pay
the
fine
to
that
servant
for
his
more
comfortable
maintenance
if
he
stays
in
his
service
a
man
of
honour
and
generosity
considers
it
would
be
miserable
to
himself
to
have
no
will
but
that
of
another
though
it
were
of
the
best
person
breathing
and
for
that
reason
goes
on
as
fast
as
he
is
able
to
put
his
servants
into
independent
livelihoods
the
greatest
part
of
sir
roger
estate
is
tenanted
by
persons
who
have
served
himself
or
his
ancestors
it
was
to
me
extremely
pleasant
to
observe
the
visitants
from
several
parts
to
welcome
his
arrival
in
the
country
and
all
the
difference
that
i
could
take
notice
of
between
the
late
servants
who
came
to
see
him
and
those
who
staid
in
the
family
was
that
these
latter
were
looked
upon
as
finer
gentlemen
and
better
courtiers
this
manumission
and
placing
them
in
a
way
of
livelihood
i
look
upon
as
only
what
is
due
to
a
good
servant
which
encouragement
will
make
his
successor
be
as
diligent
as
humble
and
as
ready
as
he
was
there
is
something
wonderful
in
the
narrowness
of
those
minds
which
can
be
pleased
and
be
barren
of
bounty
to
those
who
please
them
one
might
on
this
occasion
recount
the
sense
that
great
persons
in
all
ages
have
had
of
the
merit
of
their
dependents
and
the
heroick
services
which
men
have
done
their
masters
in
the
extremity
of
their
fortunes
and
shewn
to
their
undone
patrons
that
fortune
was
all
the
difference
between
them
but
as
i
design
this
my
speculation
only
as
a
gentle
admonition
to
thankless
masters
i
shall
not
go
out
of
the
occurrences
of
common
life
but
assert
it
as
a
general
observation
that
i
never
saw
but
in
sir
roger
family
and
one
or
two
more
good
servants
treated
as
they
ought
to
be
sir
roger
kindness
extends
to
their
children
and
this
very
morning
he
sent
his
coachman
grandson
to
prentice
i
shall
conclude
this
paper
with
an
account
of
a
picture
in
his
gallery
where
there
are
many
which
will
deserve
my
future
observation
at
the
very
upper
end
of
this
handsome
structure
i
saw
the
portraiture
of
two
young
men
standing
in
a
river
the
one
naked
the
other
in
a
livery
the
person
supported
seemed
half
dead
but
still
so
much
alive
as
to
shew
in
his
face
exquisite
joy
and
love
towards
the
other
i
thought
the
fainting
figure
resembled
my
friend
sir
roger
and
looking
at
the
butler
who
stood
by
me
for
an
account
of
it
he
informed
me
that
the
person
in
the
livery
was
a
servant
of
sir
roger
who
stood
on
the
shore
while
his
master
was
swimming
and
observing
him
taken
with
some
sudden
illness
and
sink
under
water
jumped
in
and
saved
him
he
told
me
sir
roger
took
off
the
dress
he
was
in
as
soon
as
he
came
home
and
by
a
great
bounty
at
that
time
followed
by
his
favour
ever
since
had
made
him
master
of
that
pretty
seat
which
we
saw
at
a
distance
as
we
came
to
this
house
i
remembered
indeed
sir
roger
said
there
lived
a
very
worthy
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
highly
obliged
without
mentioning
any
thing
further
upon
my
looking
a
little
dissatisfied
at
some
part
of
the
picture
my
attendant
informed
me
that
it
was
against
sir
will
and
at
the
earnest
request
of
the
gentleman
himself
that
he
was
drawn
in
the
habit
in
which
he
had
saved
his
master

him
a
huge

that
he

this
extraordinary
letter
and
message
that
accompanied

made
me
very
curious
to
know
the
character
and
quality
of
the
gentleman
who
sent
them
which
i
found
to
be
as
follows
is
younger
brother
to
a
baronet
and
descended
of
the
ancient
family
of
the
he
is
now
between
forty
and
fifty
but
being
bred
to
no
business
and
born
to
no
estate
he
generally
lives
with
his
elder
brother
as
superintendent
of
his
game
he
hunts
a
pack
of
dogs
better
than
any
man
in
the
country
and
is
very
famous
for
finding
out
a
hare
he
is
extremely
in
all
the
little
handicrafts
of
an
idle
man
he
makes
a
to
a
miracle
and
furnishes
the
whole
country
with
as
he
is
a
officious
fellow
and
very
much
esteemed
upon
account
of
his
family
he
is
a
welcome
guest
at
every
house
and
keeps
up
a
good
correspondence
among
all
the
gentlemen
about
him
he
carries
a
in
his
pocket
from
one
to
another
or
exchanges
a
puppy
between
a
couple
of
friends
that
live
perhaps
in
the
opposite
sides
of
the
county
is
a
particular
favourite
of
all
the
young
heirs
whom
he
frequently
obliges
with
a
net
that
he
has
weaved
or
a
setting
dog
that
he
has
himself
he
now
and
then
presents
a
pair
of
garters
of
his
own
knitting
to
their
mothers
or
sisters
and
raises
a
great
deal
of
mirth
among
them
by
inquiring
as
often
as
he
meets
them
they
these
manufactures
and
obliging
little
humours

the
darling
of

country
sir
roger
was
proceeding
in
the
character
of
him
when
we
saw
him
make
up
to
us
with
two
or
three
in
his
hand
that
he
had
cut
in
sir
roger
woods
as
he
came
through
them
in
his
way
to
the
house
i
was
very
much
pleased
to
observe
on
one
side
the
hearty
and
sincere
welcome
with
which
sir
roger
received
him
and
on
the
other
the
secret
joy
which
his
guest
discovered
at
sight
of
the
good
old
knight
after
the
first
salutes
were
over
desired
sir
roger
to
lend
him
one
of
his
servants
to
carry
a
set
of
shuttlecocks
he
had
with
him
in
a
little
box
to
a
lady
that
lived
about
a
mile
off
to
whom
it
seems
he
had
promised
such
a
present
for
above
this
half
year
sir
roger
back
was
no
sooner
turned
but
honest
began
to
tell
me
of
a
large
that
he
had
sprung
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
woods
with
two
or
three
other
adventures
of
the
same
nature
odd
and
uncommon
characters
are
the
game
that
i
looked
for
and
most
delight
in
for
which
reason
i
was
as
much
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
the
person
that
talked
to
me
as
he
could
be
for
his
life
with
the
springing
of
a
pheasant
and
therefore
listened
to
him
with
more
than
ordinary
attention
in
the
midst
of
his
discourse
the
bell
rung
to
dinner
where
the
gentleman
i
have
been
speaking
of
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
huge
jack
he
had
caught
served
up
for
the
first
dish
in
a
most
sumptuous
manner
upon
our
sitting
down
to
it
he
gave
us
a
long
account
how
he
had
hooked
it
played
with
it
foiled
it
and
at
length
drew
it
out
upon
the
bank
with
several
other
particulars
that
lasted
all
the
first
course
a
dish
of
that
came
afterwards
furnished
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
dinner
which
concluded
with
a
late
invention
of
for
improving
the
upon
withdrawing
into
my
room
after
dinner
i
was
secretly
touched
with
compassion
towards
the
honest
gentleman
that
had
dined
with
us
and
could
not
but
consider
with
a
great
deal
of
concern
how
so
good
an
heart
and
such
busy
hands
were
wholly
employed
in
trifles
that
so
much
humanity
should
be
so
little
beneficial
to
others
and
so
much
industry
so
little
advantageous
to
himself
the
same
temper
of
mind
and
application
to
affairs
might
have
recommended
him
to
the
publick
esteem
and
have
raised
his
fortune
in
another
station
of
life
what
good
to
his
country
or
himself
might
not
a
trader
or
merchant
have
done
with
such
useful
though
ordinary
qualifications
is
the
case
of
many
a
younger
brother
of
a
great
family
who
had
rather
see
their
children
starve
like
gentlemen
than
thrive
in
a
trade
or
profession
that
is
beneath
their
quality
this
humour
fills
several
parts
of
with
pride
and
beggary
it
is
the
happiness
of
a
trading
nation
like
ours
that
the
younger
sons
though
uncapable
of
any
liberal
art
or
profession
may
be
placed
in
such
a
way
of
life
as
may
perhaps
enable
them
to
vie
with
the
best
of
their
family
accordingly
we
find
several
citizens
that
were
launched
into
the
world
with
narrow
fortunes
rising
by
an
honest
industry
to
greater
estates
than
those
of
their
elder
brothers
it
is
not
improbable
but
was
formerly
tried
at
divinity
law
or
physick
and
that
finding
his
genius
did
not
lie
that
way
his
parents
gave
him
up
at
length
to
his
own
inventions
but
certainly
however
improper
he
might
have
been
for
studies
of
a
higher
nature
he
was
perfectly
well
turned
for
the
occupations
of
trade
and
commerce
as
i
think
this
is
a
point
which
can
not
be
too
much
inculcated
i
shall
desire
my
reader
to
compare
what
i
have
here
written
with
what
i
have
said
in
my
speculation
no
thursday
july
hor
sat
ii
of
plain
good
sense
untutor
in
the
schools
i
was
this
morning
walking
in
the
gallery
when
sir
roger
entered
at
the
end
opposite
to
me
and
advancing
towards
me
said
he
was
glad
to
meet
me
among
his
relations
the
de
coverleys
and
hoped
i
liked
the
conversation
of
so
much
good
company
who
were
as
silent
as
myself
i
knew
he
alluded
to
the
pictures
and
as
he
is
a
gentleman
who
does
not
a
little
value
himself
upon
his
ancient
descent
i
expected
he
would
give
me
some
account
of
them
we
were
now
arrived
at
the
upper
end
of
the
gallery
when
the
knight
faced
towards
one
of
the
pictures
and
as
we
stood
before
it
he
entered
into
the
matter
after
his
blunt
way
of
saying
things
as
they
occur
to
his
imagination
without
regular
introduction
or
care
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
chain
of
thought
is
said
he
while
to
consider
the
force
of
dress
and
how
the
persons
of
one
age
differ
from
those
of
another
merely
by
that
only
one
may
observe
also
that
the
general
fashion
of
one
age
has
been
followed
by
one
particular
set
of
people
in
another
and
by
them
preserved
from
one
generation
to
another
thus
the
vast
jetting
coat
and
small
bonnet
which
was
the
habit
in
the
seventh
time
is
kept
on
in
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
not
without
a
good
and
politick
view
because
they
look
a
foot
taller
and
a
foot
and
an
half
broader
besides
that
the
cap
leaves
the
face
expanded
and
consequently
more
terrible
and
fitter
to
stand
at
the
entrances
of
palaces
predecessor
of
ours
you
see
is
dressed
after
this
manner
and
his
cheeks
would
be
no
larger
than
mine
were
he
in
a
hat
as
i
am
he
was
the
last
man
that
won
a
prize
in
the
which
is
now
a
common
street
before
you
see
the
broken
lance
that
lies
there
by
his
right
foot
he
shivered
that
lance
of
his
adversary
all
to
pieces
and
bearing
himself
look
you
sir
in
this
manner
at
the
same
time
he
came
within
the
target
of
the
gentleman
who
rode
against
him
and
taking
him
with
incredible
force
before
him
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
he
in
that
manner
rid
the
tournament
over
with
an
air
that
shewed
he
did
it
rather
to
perform
the
rule
of
the
lists
than
expose
his
enemy
however
it
appeared
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
a
victory
and
with
a
gentle
trot
he
marched
up
to
a
gallery
where
their
mistress
sat
for
they
were
rivals
and
let
him
down
with
laudable
courtesy
and
pardonable
insolence
i
do
know
but
it
might
be
exactly
where
the
is
now
are
to
know
this
my
ancestor
was
not
only
of
a
a
military
genius
but
fit
also
for
the
arts
of
peace
for
he
played
on
the
as
well
as
any
gentleman
at
court
you
see
where
his
viol
hangs
by
his
sword
the
action
at
the
you
may
be
sure
won
the
fair
lady
who
was
a
maid
of
honour
and
the
greatest
beauty
of
her
time
here
she
stands
the
next
picture
you
see
sir
my
has
on
the
petticoat
except
that
the
modern
is
gathered
at
the
waist
my
grandmother
appears
as
if
she
stood
in
a
large
drum
whereas
the
ladies
now
walk
as
if
they
were
in
a
cart
for
all
this
lady
was
bred
at
court
she
became
an
excellent
she
brought
ten
children
and
when
i
shew
you
the
library
you
shall
see
in
her
own
hand
allowing
for
the
difference
of
the
language
the
best
receipt
now
in
both
for
an
pudding
and
a
you
please
to
fall
back
a
little
because
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
three
next
pictures
at
one
view
these
are
three
sisters
she
on
the
right
hand
who
is
so
beautiful
died
a
maid
the
next
to
her
still
handsomer
had
the
same
fate
against
her
will
this
homely
thing
in
the
middle
had
both
their
portions
added
to
her
own
and
was
stolen
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
a
man
of
stratagem
and
resolution
for
he
poisoned
three
mastiffs
to
come
at
her
and
knocked
down
two
stealers
in
carrying
her
off
misfortunes
happen
in
all
families
the
theft
of
this
romp
and
so
much
money
was
no
great
matter
to
our
estate
but
the
next
heir
that
possessed
it
was
this
soft
gentleman
whom
you
see
there
observe
the
small
buttons
the
little
boots
the
laces
the
slashes
about
his
clothes
and
above
all
the
posture
he
is
drawn
in
which
to
be
sure
was
his
own
chusing
you
see
he
sits
with
one
hand
on
a
desk
writing
and
looking
as
it
were
another
way
like
an
easy
writer
or
a
sonneteer
he
was
one
of
those
that
had
too
much
wit
to
know
how
to
live
in
the
world
he
was
a
man
of
no
justice
but
great
good
manners
he
ruined
every
body
that
had
anything
to
do
with
him
but
never
said
a
rude
thing
in
his
life
the
most
indolent
person
in
the
world
he
would
sign
a
deed
that
passed
away
half
his
estate
with
his
gloves
on
but
would
not
put
on
his
hat
before
a
lady
if
it
were
to
save
his
country
he
is
said
to
be
the
first
that
made
love
by
squeezing
the
hand
he
left
the
estate
with
ten
thousand
pounds
debt
upon
it
but
however
by
all
hands
i
have
been
informed
that
he
was
every
way
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
world
that
debt
lay
heavy
on
our
house
for
one
generation
but
it
was
retrieved
by
a
gift
from
that
honest
man
you
see
there
a
citizen
of
our
name
but
nothing
at
all
akin
to
us
i
know
sir
andrew
freeport
has
said
behind
my
back
that
this
man
was
descended
from
one
of
the
ten
children
of
the
maid
of
honour
i
shewed
you
above
but
it
was
never
made
out
we
winked
at
the
thing
indeed
because
money
was
wanting
at
that
time
here
i
saw
my
friend
a
little
embarrassed
and
turned
my
face
to
the
next
portraiture
sir
roger
went
on
with
his
account
of
the
gallery
in
the
following
manner
man
pointing
to
him
i
looked
at
take
to
be
the
honour
of
our
house
sir
humphrey
de
coverley
he
was
in
his
dealings
as
punctual
as
a
tradesman
and
as
generous
as
a
gentleman
he
would
have
thought
himself
as
much
undone
by
breaking
his
word
as
if
it
were
to
be
followed
by
bankruptcy
he
served
his
country
as
knight
of
this
shire
to
his
dying
day
he
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
maintain
an
integrity
in
his
words
and
actions
even
in
things
that
regarded
the
offices
which
were
incumbent
upon
him
in
the
care
of
his
own
affairs
and
relations
of
life
and
therefore
dreaded
though
he
had
great
talents
to
go
into
employments
of
state
where
he
must
be
exposed
to
the
snares
of
ambition
innocence
of
life
and
great
ability
were
the
distinguishing
parts
of
his
character
the
latter
he
had
often
observed
had
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
former
and
used
frequently
to
lament
that
great
and
good
had
not
the
same
signification
he
was
an
excellent
husbandman
but
had
resolved
not
to
exceed
such
a
degree
of
wealth
all
above
it
he
bestowed
in
secret
bounties
many
years
after
the
sum
he
aimed
at
for
his
own
use
was
attained
yet
he
did
not
slacken
his
industry
but
to
a
decent
old
age
spent
the
life
and
fortune
which
was
superfluous
to
himself
in
the
service
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
here
we
were
called
to
dinner
and
sir
roger
ended
the
discourse
of
this
gentleman
by
telling
me
as
we
followed
the
servant
that
this
his
ancestor
was
a
brave
man
and
narrowly
escaped
being
killed
in
the
civil
wars
said
he
he
was
sent
out
of
the
field
upon
a
private
message
the
day
before
the
battle
of
the
whim
of
narrowly
escaping
by
having
been
within
a
day
of
danger
with
other
matters
mixed
with
good
sense
left
me
at
a
loss
whether
i
was
more
delighted
with
my
friend
wisdom
or
simplicity
no
friday
july
ubique
animos
simul
ipsa

aen
ii
all
things
are
full
of
horror
and
affright
and
dreadful
the
silence
of
the
night
dryden
at
a
little
distance
from
sir
roger
house
among
the
ruins
of
an
old
abbey
there
is
a
long
walk
of
aged
elms
which
are
shot
up
so
very
high
that
when
one
passes
under
them
the
rooks
and
crows
that
rest
upon
the
tops
of
them
seem
to
be
cawing
in
another
region
i
am
very
much
delighted
with
this
sort
of
noise
which
i
consider
as
a
kind
of
natural
prayer
to
that
being
who
supplies
the
wants
of
his
whole
creation
and
who
in
the
beautiful
language
of
the
feedeth
the
young
ravens
that
call
upon
him
i
like
this
retirement
the
better
because
of
an
ill
report
it
lies
under
of
being
for
which
reason
as
i
have
been
told
in
the
family
no
living
creature
ever
walks
in
it
besides
the
chaplain
my
good
friend
the
butler
desired
me
with
a
very
grave
face
not
to
venture
myself
in
it
after
for
that
one
of
the
footmen
had
been
almost
frighted
out
of
his
wits
by
a
spirit
that
appeared
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
black
horse
without
an
head
to
which
he
added
that
about
a
month
ago
one
of
the
maids
coming
home
late
that
way
with
a
pail
of
milk
upon
her
head
heard
such
a
rustling
among
the
bushes
that
she
let
it
fall
i
was
taking
a
walk
in
this
place
last
night
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
and
could
not
but
fancy
it
one
of
the
most
proper
scenes
in
the
world
for
a
ghost
to
appear
in
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
are
scattered
up
and
down
on
every
side
and
with
ivy
and
elder
bushes
the
harbours
of
several
solitary
birds
which
seldom
make
their
appearance
till
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
place
was
formerly
a
and
has
still
several
marks
in
it
of
graves
and
there
is
such
an
echo
among
the
old
ruins
and
vaults
that
if
you
stamp
but
a
little
louder
than
ordinary
you
hear
the
sound
repeated
at
the
same
time
the
walk
of
elms
with
the
croaking
of
the
ravens
which
from
time
to
time
are
heard
from
the
tops
of
them
looks
exceeding
solemn
and
venerable
these
objects
naturally
raise
seriousness
and
attention
and
when
night
heightens
the
awfulness
of
the
place
and
pours
out
her
supernumerary
horrors
upon
every
thing
in
it
i
do
not
at
all
wonder
that
weak
minds
fill
it
with
spectres
and
apparitions
in
his
chapter
of
the
association
of
ideas
has
very
curious
remarks
to
show
how
by
the
prejudice
of
education
one
idea
often
introduces
into
the
mind
a
whole
set
that
bear
no
resemblance
to
one
another
in
the
nature
of
things
among
several
examples
of
this
kind
he
produces
the
following
instance
ideas
of
goblins
and
sprights
have
really
no
more
to
do
with
darkness
than
light
yet
let
but
a
foolish
maid
inculcate
these
often
on
the
mind
of
a
child
and
raise
them
there
together
possibly
he
shall
never
be
able
to
separate
them
again
so
long
as
he
lives
but
darkness
shall
ever
afterwards
bring
with
it
those
frightful
ideas
and
they
shall
be
so
joined
that
he
can
no
more
bear
the
one
than
the
as
i
was
walking
in
this
solitude
where
the
dusk
of
the
evening
conspired
with
so
many
other
occasions
of
terror
i
observed
a
cow
grazing
not
far
from
me
which
an
imagination
that
was
apt
to
might
easily
have
construed
into
a
black
horse
without
an
head
and
i
dare
say
the
poor
footman
lost
his
wits
upon
some
such
trivial
occasion
my
friend
sir
roger
has
often
told
me
with
a
good
deal
of
mirth
that
at
his
first
coming
to
his
estate
he
found
three
parts
of
his
house
altogether
useless
that
the
best
room
in
it
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
and
by
that
means
was
locked
up
that
noises
had
been
heard
in
his
long
gallery
so
that
he
could
not
get
a
servant
to
enter
it
after
eight
at
night
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
chambers
was
nailed
up
because
there
went
a
story
in
the
family
that
a
butler
had
formerly
hanged
himself
in
it
and
that
his
mother
who
lived
to
a
great
age
had
shut
up
half
the
rooms
in
the
house
in
which
either
her
husband
a
son
or
daughter
had
died
the
knight
seeing
his
habitation
reduced
to
so
small
a
compass
and
himself
in
a
manner
shut
out
of
his
own
house
upon
the
death
of
his
mother
ordered
all
the
apartments
to
be
flung
open
and
by
his
chaplain
who
lay
in
every
room
one
after
another
and
by
that
means
dissipated
the
fears
which
had
so
long
reigned
in
the
family
i
should
not
have
been
thus
particular
upon
these
ridiculous
horrors
did
not
i
find
them
so
very
much
prevail
in
all
parts
of
the
country
at
the
same
time
i
think
a
person
who
is
thus
terrified
with
the
imagination
of
ghosts
and
spectres
much
more
reasonable
than
one
who
contrary
to
the
reports
of
all
historians
sacred
and
profane
ancient
and
modern
and
to
the
traditions
of
all
nations
thinks
the
appearance
of
spirits
fabulous
and
groundless
could
not
i
give
myself
up
to
this
general
testimony
of
mankind
i
should
to
the
relations
of
particular
persons
who
are
now
living
and
whom
i
can
not
distrust
in
other
matters
of
fact
i
might
here
add
that
not
only
the
historians
to
whom
we
may
join
the
poets
but
likewise
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
have
favoured
this
opinion
himself
though
by
the
course
of
his
philosophy
he
was
obliged
to
maintain
that
the
soul
did
not
exist
separate
from
the
body
makes
no
doubt
of
the
reality
of
apparitions
and
that
men
have
often
appeared
after
their
death
this
i
think
very
remarkable
he
was
so
pressed
with
the
matter
of
fact
which
he
could
not
have
the
confidence
to
deny
that
he
was
forced
to
account
for
it
by
one
of
the
most
absurd
unphilosophical
notions
that
was
ever
started
he
tells
us
that
the
surfaces
of
all
bodies
are
perpetually
flying
off
from
their
respective
bodies
one
after
another
and
that
these
surfaces
or
thin
cases
that
included
each
other
whilst
they
were
joined
in
the
body
like
the
coats
of
an
onion
are
sometimes
seen
entire
when
they
are
separated
from
it
by
which
means
we
often
behold
the
shapes
and
shadows
of
persons
who
are
either
dead
or
absent
i
shall
dismiss
this
paper
with
a
story
out
of
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
story
itself
as
for
the
moral
reflexions
with
which
the
author
concludes
it
and
which
i
shall
here
set
down
in
his
own
words
the
daughter
of
king
after
the
death
of
her
two
first
husbands
being
married
to
a
third
who
was
brother
to
her
first
husband
and
so
passionately
in
love
with
her
that
he
turned
off
his
former
wife
to
make
room
for
this
marriage
had
a
very
odd
kind
of
dream
she
fancied
that
she
saw
her
first
husband
coming
towards
her
and
that
she
embraced
him
with
great
tenderness
when
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasure
which
she
expressed
at
the
sight
of
him
he
reproached
her
after
the
following
manner
says
he
thou
hast
made
good
the
old
saying
that
women
are
not
to
be
trusted
was
not
i
the
husband
of
thy
virginity
have
i
not
children
by
thee
how
couldst
thou
forget
our
loves
so
far
as
to
enter
into
a
second
marriage
and
after
that
into
a
third
nay
to
take
for
thy
husband
a
man
who
has
so
shamefully
crept
into
the
bed
of
his
brother
however
for
the
sake
of
our
passed
loves
i
shall
free
thee
from
thy
present
reproach
and
make
thee
mine
for
ever
glaphyra
told
this
dream
to
several
women
of
her
acquaintance
and
died
soon
after
i
thought
this
story
might
not
be
impertinent
in
this
place
wherein
i
speak
of
those
kings
besides
that
the
example
deserves
to
be
taken
notice
of
as
it
contains
a
most
certain
proof
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
of
divine
providence
if
any
man
thinks
these
facts
incredible
let
him
enjoy
his
own
opinion
to
himself
but
let
him
not
endeavour
to
disturb
the
belief
of
others
who
by
instances
of
this
nature
are
excited

as
it
puts
both
the
sexes
upon
appearing
in
their
most
agreeable
forms
and
exerting
all
such
qualities
as
are
apt
to
give
them
a
figure
in
the
eye
of
the

himself

citizen
does

either
after
sermon
or
before
the
bell

my
friend
sir
roger
being
a
good
churchman
has
beautified
the
inside
of
his
church
with
several
texts
of
his
own
chusing
he
has
likewise
given
a
handsome
and
railed
in
the
at
his
own
expence
he
has
often
told
me
that
at
his
coming
to
his
estate
he
found
his
parishioners
very
irregular
and
that
in
order
to
make
them
kneel
and
join
in
the
responses
he
gave
every
one
of
them
a
hassock
and
a
and
at
the
same
time
employed
an
itinerant
who
goes
about
the
country
for
that
purpose
to
instruct
them
rightly
in
the
tunes
of
the
psalms
upon
which
they
now
very
much
value
themselves
and
indeed
most
of
the
country
churches
that
i
have
ever
heard
as
sir
roger
is
landlord
to
the
whole
congregation
he
keeps
them
in
very
good
order
and
will
suffer
no
body
to
sleep
in
it
besides
himself
for
if
by
chance
he
has
been
surprised
into
a
short
nap
at
sermon
upon
recovering
out
of
it
he
stands
up
and
looks
about
him
and
if
he
sees
any
body
else
nodding
either
wakes
them
himself
or
sends
his
servants
to
them
several
other
of
the
old
knight
particularities
break
out
upon
these
occasions
sometimes
he
will
be
lengthening
out
a
verse
in
the
singing
psalms
half
a
minute
after
the
rest
of
the
congregation
have
done
with
it
sometimes
when
he
is
pleased
with
the
matter
of
his
devotion
he
pronounces
three
or
four
times
to
the
same
prayer
and
sometimes
stands
up
when
every
body
else
is
upon
their
knees
to
count
the
congregation
or
see
if
any
of
his
tenants
are
missing
i
was
yesterday
very
much
surprised
to
hear
my
old
friend
in
the
midst
of
the
service
calling
out
to
one
john
matthews
to
mind
what
he
was
about
and
not
disturb
the
congregation
this
it
seems
is
remarkable
for
being
an
idle
fellow
and
at
that
time
was
kicking
his
heels
for
his
diversion
this
authority
of
the
knight
though
exerted
in
that
odd
manner
which
accompanies
him
in
all
circumstances
of
life
has
a
very
good
effect
upon
the
parish
who
are
not
polite
enough
to
see
any
thing
ridiculous
in
his
behaviour
besides
that
the
general
good
sense
and
worthiness
of
his
character
makes
his
friends
observe
these
little
singularities
as
foils
that
rather
set
off
than
blemish
his
good
qualities
as
soon
as
the
sermon
is
finished
no
body
presumes
to
stir
till
sir
roger
is
gone
out
of
the
church
the
knight
walks
down
from
his
seat
in
the
chancel
between
a
double
row
of
his
tenants
that
stand
bowing
to
him
on
each
side
and
every
now
and
then
inquires
how
such
an
wife
or
mother
or
son
or
father
do
whom
he
does
not
see
at
church
which
is
understood
as
a
secret
reprimand
to
the
person
that
is
absent
the
chaplain
has
often
told
me
that
upon
a
when
sir
roger
has
been
pleased
with
a
boy
that
answers
well
he
has
ordered
a
bible
to
be
given
him
next
day
for
his
encouragement
and
sometimes
accompanies
it
with
a
flitch
of
bacon
to
his
mother
sir
roger
has
likewise
added
five
pounds
a
year
to
the
clerk
place
and
that
he
may
encourage
the
young
fellows
to
make
themselves
perfect
in
the
service
has
promised
upon
the
death
of
the
present
incumbent
who
is
very
old
to
bestow
it
according
to
merit
the
fair
understanding
between
sir
roger
and
his
chaplain
and
their
mutual
concurrence
in
doing
good
is
the
more
remarkable
because
the
very
next
village
is
famous
for
the
differences
and
contentions
that
arise
between
the
parson
and
the
who
live
in
a
perpetual
state
of
war
the
parson
is
always
preaching
at
the
and
the
to
be
revenged
on
the
parson
never
comes
to
church
the
has
made
all
his
tenants
atheists
and
while
the
parson
instructs
them
every
in
the
dignity
of
his
order
and
insinuates
to
them
in
almost
every
sermon
that
he
is
a
better
man
than
his
patron
in
short
matters
are
come
to
such
an
extremity
that
the
squire
has
not
said
his
prayers
either
in
public
or
private
this
half
year
and
that
the
parson
threatens
him
if
he
does
not
mend
his
manners
to
pray
for
him
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
feuds
of
this
nature
though
too
frequent
in
the
country
are
very
fatal
to
the
ordinary
people
who
are
so
used
to
be
dazzled
with
riches
that
they
pay
as
much
deference
to
the
understanding
of
a
man
of
an
estate
as
of
a
man
of
learning
and
are
very
hardly
brought
to
regard
any
truth
how
important
soever
it
may
be
that
is
preached
to
them
when
they
know
there
are
several
men
of
five
hundred
a
year
who
do
not
believe

her
looks
were
deep
imprinted
in
his
heart
in
my
first
description
of
the
company
in
which
i
pass
most
of
my
time
it
may
be
remembered
that
i
mentioned
a
great
affliction
which
my
friend
sir
roger
had
met
with
in
his
youth
which
was
no
less
than
a
disappointment
in
love
it
happened
this
evening
that
we
fell
into
a
very
pleasing
walk
at
a
distance
from
his
house
as
soon
as
we
came
into
it
is
quoth
the
good
old
man
looking
round
him
with
a
smile
hard
that
any
part
of
my
land
should
be
settled
upon
one
who
has
used
me
so
ill
as
the
perverse
widow
did
and
yet
i
am
sure
i
could
not
see
a
sprig
of
any
bough
of
this
whole
walk
of
trees
but
i
should
reflect
upon
her
and
her
severity
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
you
are
to
know
this
was
the
place
wherein
i
used
to
muse
upon
her
and
by
that
custom
i
can
never
come
into
it
but
the
same
tender
sentiments
revive
in
my
mind
as
if
i
had
actually
walked
with
that
beautiful
creature
under
these
shades
i
have
been
fool
enough
to
carve
her
name
on
the
bark
of
several
of
these
trees
so
unhappy
is
the
condition
of
men
in
love
to
attempt
the
removing
of
their
passions
by
the
methods
which
serve
only
to
imprint
it
deeper
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
here
followed
a
profound
silence
and
i
was
not
displeased
to
observe
my
friend
falling
so
naturally
into
a
discourse
which
i
had
ever
before
taken
notice
he
industriously
avoided
after
a
very
long
pause
he
entered
upon
an
account
of
this
great
circumstance
in
his
life
with
an
air
which
i
thought
raised
my
idea
of
him
above
what
i
had
ever
had
before
and
gave
me
the
picture
of
that
cheerful
mind
of
his
before
it
received
that
stroke
which
has
ever
since
affected
his
words
and
actions
but
he
went
on
as
follows
came
to
my
estate
in
my
year
and
resolved
to
follow
the
steps
of
the
most
worthy
of
my
ancestors
who
have
inhabited
this
spot
of
earth
before
me
in
all
the
methods
of
hospitality
and
good
neighbourhood
for
the
sake
of
my
fame
and
in
and
recreations
for
the
sake
of
my
health
in
my
year
i
was
obliged
to
serve
as
sheriff
of
the
county
and
in
my
servants
officers
and
whole
equipage
indulged
the
pleasure
of
a
young
man
who
did
not
think
ill
of
his
own
person
in
taking
that
publick
occasion
of
shewing
my
figure
and
behaviour
to
advantage
you
may
easily
imagine
to
yourself
what
appearance
i
made
who
am
pretty
tall
rid
well
and
was
very
well
dressed
at
the
head
of
a
whole
county
with
musick
before
me
a
feather
in
my
hat
and
my
horse
well
bitted
i
can
assure
you
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
kind
looks
and
glances
i
had
from
all
the
balconies
and
windows
as
i
rode
to
the
hall
where
the
assizes
were
held
but
when
i
came
there
a
beautiful
creature
in
a
widow
habit
sat
in
court
to
hear
the
event
of
a
cause
concerning
her
dower
this
commanding
creature
who
was
born
for
the
destruction
of
all
who
behold
her
put
on
such
a
resignation
in
her
countenance
and
bore
the
whispers
of
all
around
the
court
with
such
a
pretty
uneasiness
i
warrant
you
and
then
recovered
herself
from
one
eye
to
another
till
she
was
perfectly
confused
by
meeting
something
so
wistful
in
all
she
encountered
that
at
last
with
a
murrain
to
her
she
cast
her
bewitching
eye
upon
me
i
no
sooner
met
it
but
i
bowed
like
a
great
surprized
booby
and
knowing
her
cause
to
be
the
first
which
came
on
i
cried
like
a
captivated
calf
as
i
was
make
way
for
the
witnesses
this
sudden
partiality
made
all
the
county
immediately
see
the
sheriff
was
also
become
a
slave
to
the
fine
widow
during
the
time
her
cause
was
upon
trial
she
behaved
herself
i
warrant
you
with
such
a
deep
attention
to
her
business
took
opportunities
to
have
little
billets
handed
to
her
counsel
then
would
be
in
such
a
pretty
confusion
occasioned
you
must
know
by
acting
before
so
much
company
that
not
only
i
but
the
whole
court
was
prejudiced
in
her
favour
and
all
that
the
next
heir
to
her
husband
had
to
urge
was
thought
so
groundless
and
frivolous
that
when
it
came
to
her
counsel
to
reply
there
was
not
half
so
much
said
as
every
one
besides
in
the
court
thought
he
could
have
urged
to
her
advantage
you
must
understand
sir
this
perverse
woman
is
one
of
those
unaccountable
creatures
that
secretly
rejoice
in
the
admiration
of
men
but
indulge
themselves
in
no
farther
consequences
hence
it
is
that
she
has
ever
had
a
train
of
admirers
and
she
removes
from
her
slaves
in
town
to
those
in
the
country
according
to
the
seasons
of
the
year
she
is
a
reading
lady
and
far
gone
in
the
pleasures
of
friendship
she
is
always
accompanied
by
a
confident
who
is
witness
to
her
daily
protestations
against
our
sex
and
consequently
a
bar
to
her
first
steps
towards
love
upon
the
strength
of
her
own
maxims
and
declarations
i
must
needs
say
this
accomplished
mistress
of
mine
has
distinguished
me
above
the
rest
and
has
been
known
to
declare
sir
roger
de
coverley
was
the
tamest
and
most
humane
of
all
the
brutes
in
the
country
i
was
told
she
said
so
by
one
who
thought
he
rallied
me
but
upon
the
strength
of
this
slender
encouragement
of
being
thought
least
detestable
i
made
new
liveries
my
sent
them
all
to
town
to
be
bitted
and
taught
to
throw
their
legs
well
and
move
all
together
before
i
pretended
to
cross
the
country
and
wait
upon
her
as
soon
as
i
thought
my
retinue
suitable
to
the
character
of
my
fortune
and
youth
i
set
out
from
hence
to
make
my
addresses
the
particular
skill
of
this
lady
has
ever
been
to
inflame
your
wishes
and
yet
command
respect
to
make
her
mistress
of
this
art
she
has
a
greater
share
of
knowledge
wit
and
good
sense
than
is
usual
even
among
men
of
merit
then
she
is
beautiful
beyond
the
race
of
women
if
you
will
not
let
her
go
on
with
a
certain
artifice
with
her
eyes
and
the
skill
of
beauty
she
will
arm
herself
with
her
real
charms
and
strike
you
with
admiration
instead
of
desire
it
is
certain
that
if
you
were
to
behold
the
whole
woman
there
is
that
dignity
in
her
aspect
that
composure
in
her
motion
that
complacency
in
her
manner
that
if
her
form
makes
you
hope
her
merit
makes
you
fear
but
then
again
she
is
such
a
desperate
scholar
that
no
can
approach
her
without
being
a
jest
as
i
was
going
to
tell
you
when
i
came
to
her
house
i
was
admitted
to
her
presence
with
great
civility
at
the
same
time
she
placed
herself
to
be
first
seen
by
me
in
such
an
attitude
as
i
think
you
call
the
posture
of
a
picture
that
she
discovered
new
charms
and
i
at
last
came
towards
her
with
such
an
awe
as
made
me
speechless
this
she
no
sooner
observed
but
she
made
her
advantage
of
it
and
began
a
discourse
to
me
concerning
love
and
honour
as
they
both
are
followed
by
pretenders
and
the
real
votaries
to
them
when
she
discussed
these
points
in
a
discourse
which
i
verily
believe
was
as
learned
as
the
best
philosopher
in
could
possibly
make
she
asked
me
whether
she
was
so
happy
as
to
fall
in
with
my
sentiments
on
these
important
particulars
her
confident
sat
by
her
and
upon
my
being
in
the
last
confusion
and
silence
this
malicious
aid
of
hers
turning
to
her
says
am
very
glad
to
observe
sir
roger
pauses
upon
this
subject
and
seems
resolved
to
deliver
all
his
sentiments
upon
the
matter
when
he
pleases
to
speak
they
both
kept
their
countenances
and
after
i
had
sat
half
an
hour
meditating
how
to
behave
before
such
profound
casuists
i
rose
up
and
took
my
leave
chance
has
since
that
time
thrown
me
very
often
in
her
way
and
she
as
often
has
directed
a
discourse
to
me
which
i
do
not
understand
this
barbarity
has
kept
me
ever
at
a
distance
from
the
most
beautiful
object
my
eyes
ever
beheld
it
is
thus
also
she
deals
with
all
mankind
and
you
must
make
love
to
her
as
you
would
conquer
the
sphinx
by
posing
her
but
were
she
like
other
women
and
that
there
were
any
talking
to
her
how
constant
must
the
pleasure
of
that
man
be
who
would
converse
with
the
creature
but
after
all
you
may
be
sure
her
heart
is
fixed
on
some
one
or
other
and
yet
i
have
been
credibly
informed
but
who
can
believe
half
that
is
said
after
she
had
done
speaking
to
me
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
and
adjusted
her
tucker
then
she
cast
her
eyes
a
little
down
upon
my
beholding
her
too
earnestly
they
say
she
sings
excellently
her
voice
in
her
ordinary
speech
has
something
in
it
inexpressibly
sweet
you
must
know
i
dined
with
her
at
a
publick
table
the
day
after
i
first
saw
her
and
she
helped
me
to
some
tansy
in
the
eye
of
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
country
she
has
certainly
the
finest
hand
of
any
woman
in
the
world
i
can
assure
you
sir
were
you
to
behold
her
you
would
be
in
the
same
condition
for
as
her
speech
is
musick
her
form
is
angelick
but
i
find
i
grow
irregular
while
i
am
talking
of
her
but
indeed
it
would
be
stupidity
to
be
unconcerned
at
such
perfection
oh
the
excellent
creature
she
is
as
inimitable
to
all
women
as
she
is
inaccessible
to
all
men
i
found
my
friend
begin
to
rave
and
insensibly
led
him
towards
the
house
that
we
might
be
joined
by
some
other
company
and
am
convinced
that
the
widow
is
the
secret
cause
of
all
that
inconsistency
which
appears
in
some
parts
of
my
friend
discourse
though
he
has
so
much
command
of
himself
as
not
directly
to
mention
her
yet

the
dread
of
nothing
more
than
to
be
thought
necessitous
and
poor
pooly
oeconomy
in
our
affairs
has
the
same
effect
upon
our
fortunes
which
has
upon
our
conversations
there
is
a
pretending
behaviour
in
both
cases
which
instead
of
making
men
esteemed
renders
them
both
miserable
and
contemptible
we
had
yesterday
at
sir
roger
a
set
of
country
gentlemen
who
dined
with
him
and
after
dinner
the
glass
was
taken
by
those
who
pleased
pretty
plentifully
among
others
i
observed
a
person
of
a
tolerable
good
aspect
who
seemed
to
be
more
greedy
of
liquor
than
any
of
the
company
and
yet
methought
he
did
not
taste
it
with
delight
as
he
grew
warm
he
was
suspicious
of
every
thing
that
was
said
and
as
he
advanced
towards
being
fuddled
his
humour
grew
worse
at
the
same
time
his
bitterness
seemed
to
be
rather
an
inward
dissatisfaction
in
his
own
mind
than
any
dislike
he
had
taken
to
the
company
upon
hearing
his
name
i
knew
him
to
be
a
gentleman
of
a
considerable
fortune
in
this
county
but
greatly
in
debt
what
gives
the
unhappy
man
this
peevishness
of
spirit
is
that
his
estate
is
dipped
and
is
eating
out
with
usury
and
yet
he
has
not
the
heart
to
sell
any
part
of
it
his
proud
stomach
at
the
cost
of
restless
nights
constant
inquietudes
danger
of
affronts
and
a
thousand
nameless
inconveniences
preserves
this
canker
in
his
fortune
rather
than
it
shall
be
said
he
is
a
man
of
fewer
hundreds
a
year
than
he
has
been
commonly
reputed
thus
he
endures
the
torment
of
poverty
to
avoid
the
name
of
being
less
rich
if
you
go
to
his
house
you
see
great
plenty
but
served
in
a
manner
that
shews
it
is
all
unnatural
and
that
the
master
mind
is
not
at
home
there
is
a
certain
waste
and
carelessness
in
the
air
of
every
thing
and
the
whole
appears
but
a
covered
indigence
a
magnificent
poverty
that
neatness
and
chearfulness
which
attends
the
table
of
him
who
lives
within
compass
is
wanting
and
exchanged
for
a
libertine
way
of
service
in
all
about
him
this
gentleman
conduct
though
a
very
common
way
of
management
is
as
ridiculous
as
the
officer
would
be
who
had
but
few
men
under
his
command
and
should
take
the
charge
of
an
extent
of
country
rather
than
of
a
small
pass
to
pay
for
personate
and
keep
in
a
man
hands
a
greater
estate
than
he
really
has
is
of
all
others
the
most
unpardonable
vanity
and
must
in
the
end
reduce
the
man
who
is
guilty
of
it
to
dishonour
yet
if
we
look
round
us
in
any
county
of
we
shall
see
many
in
this
fatal
error
if
that
may
be
called
by
so
soft
a
name
which
proceeds
from
a
false
shame
of
appearing
what
they
really
are
when
the
contrary
behaviour
would
in
a
short
time
advance
them
to
the
condition
which
they
pretend
to
has
fifteen
hundred
pounds
a
year
which
is
mortgaged
for
six
thousand
pounds
but
it
is
impossible
to
convince
him
that
if
he
sold
as
much
as
would
pay
off
that
debt
he
would
save
four
shillings
in
the
pound
which
he
gives
for
the
vanity
of
being
the
reputed
master
of
it
yet
if
did
this
he
would
perhaps
be
easier
in
his
own
fortune
but
then
a
fellow
of
yesterday
who
has
but
twelve
hundred
a
year
would
be
his
equal
rather
than
this
shall
be
goes
on
to
bring
wellborn
beggars
into
the
world
and
every
twelvemonth
charges
his
estate
with
at
least
one
year
rent
more
by
the
birth
of
a
child
and
are
neighbours
whose
way
of
living
are
an
abomination
to
each
other
is
moved
by
the
fear
of
poverty
and
by
the
shame
of
it
though
the
motive
of
action
is
of
so
near
affinity
in
both
and
may
be
resolved
into
this
to
each
of
them
poverty
is
the
greatest
of
all
evils
yet
are
their
manners
very
widely
different
shame
of
poverty
makes
launch
into
unnecessary
equipage
vain
expence
and
lavish
entertainments
fear
of
poverty
makes
allow
himself
only
plain
necessaries
appear
without
a
servant
sell
his
own
corn
attend
his
labourers
and
be
himself
a
labourer
shame
of
poverty
makes
go
every
day
a
step
nearer
to
it
and
fear
of
poverty
stirs
up
to
make
every
day
some
further
progress
from
it
these
different
motives
produce
the
excesses
which
men
are
guilty
of
in
the
negligence
of
and
provision
for
themselves
usury
extortion
and
oppression
have
their
seed
in
the
dread
of
want
and
vanity
riot
and
prodigality
from
the
shame
of
it
but
both
these
excesses
are
infinitely
below
the
pursuit
of
a
reasonable
creature
after
we
have
taken
care
to
command
so
much
as
is
necessary
for
maintaining
ourselves
in
the
order
of
men
suitable
to
our
character
the
care
of
superfluities
is
a
vice
no
less
extravagant
than
the
neglect
of
necessaries
would
have
been
before
certain
it
is
that
they
are
both
out
of
nature
when
she
is
followed
with
reason
and
good
sense
it
is
from
this
reflexion
that
i
always
read
with
the
greatest
pleasure
his
magnanimity
is
as
much
above
that
of
other
considerable
men
as
his
understanding
and
it
is
a
true
distinguishing
spirit
in
the
elegant
author
who
published
his
works
to
dwell
so
much
upon
the
temper
of
his
mind
and
the
moderation
of
his
desires
by
this
means
he
has
rendered
his
friend
as
amiable
as
famous
that
state
of
life
which
bears
the
face
of
poverty
with
great
is
admirably
described
and
it
is
no
small
satisfaction
to
those
of
the
same
turn
of
desire
that
he
produces
the
authority
of
the
wisest
men
of
the
best
age
of
the
world
to
strengthen
his
opinion
of
the
ordinary
pursuits
of
mankind
it
would
methinks
be
no
ill
maxim
of
life
if
according
to
that
ancestor
of
sir
roger
whom
i
lately
mentioned
every
man
would
point
to
himself
what
sum
he
would
resolve
not
to
exceed
he
might
by
this
means
cheat
himself
into
a
tranquillity
on
this
side
of
that
expectation
or
convert
what
he
should
get
above
it
to
nobler
uses
than
his
own
pleasures
or
necessities
this
temper
of
mind
would
exempt
a
man
from
an
ignorant
envy
of
restless
men
above
him
and
a
more
inexcusable
contempt
of
happy
men
below
him
this
would
be
sailing
by
some
compass
living
with
some
design
but
to
be
eternally
bewildered
in
prospects
of
future
gain
and
putting
on
unnecessary
armour
against
improbable
blows
of
fortune
is
a
mechanick
being
which
has
not
good
sense
for
its
direction
but
is
carried
on
by
a
sort
of
acquired
instinct
towards
things
below
our
consideration
and
unworthy
our
esteem
it
is
possible
that
the
tranquillity
i
now
enjoy
at
sir
roger
may
have
created
in
me
this
way
of
thinking
which
is
so
abstracted
from
the
common
relish
of
the
world
but
as
i
am
now
in
a
pleasing
arbour
surrounded
with
a
beautiful
landscape
i
find
no
inclination
so
strong
as
to
continue
in
these
mansions
so
remote
from
the
ostentatious
scenes
of
life
and
am
at
this
present
writing
philosopher
enough
to
conclude
with
cowley
if
ambition
did
my
fancy
cheat
with
any
wish
so
mean
as

a
healthy
body

a
mind
at
ease
bodily
labour
is
of
two
kinds
either
that
which
a
man
submits
to
for
his
livelihood
or
that
which
he
undergoes
for
his
pleasure
the
latter
of
them
generally
changes
the
name
of
labour
for
that
of
exercise
but
differs
only
from
ordinary
labour
as
it
rises
from
another
motive
a
country
life
abounds
in
both
these
kinds
of
labour
and
for
that
reason
gives
a
man
a
greater
stock
of
health
and
consequently
a
more
perfect
enjoyment
of
himself
than
any
other
way
of
life
i
consider
the
body
as
a
system
of
tubes
and
glands
or
to
use
a
more
rustic
phrase
a
bundle
of
pipes
and
strainers
fitted
to
one
another
after
so
wonderful
a
manner
as
to
make
a
proper
engine
for
the
soul
to
work
with
this
description
does
not
only
comprehend
the
bowels
bones
tendons
veins
nerves
and
arteries
but
every
muscle
and
every
ligature
which
is
a
composition
of
fibres
that
are
so
many
imperceptible
tubes
or
pipes
interwoven
on
all
sides
with
invisible
glands
or
strainers
this
general
idea
of
a
human
body
without
considering
it
in
its
niceties
of
anatomy
lets
us
see
how
absolutely
necessary
labour
is
for
the
right
preservation
of
it
there
must
be
frequent
motions
and
agitations
to
mix
digest
and
separate
the
juices
contained
in
it
as
well
as
to
clear
and
cleanse
that
infinitude
of
pipes
and
strainers
of
which
it
is
composed
and
to
give
their
solid
parts
a
more
firm
and
lasting
tone
labour
or
exercise
ferments
the
humours
casts
them
into
their
proper
channels
throws
off
redundancies
and
helps
nature
in
those
secret
distributions
without
which
the
body
can
not
subsist
in
its
vigour
nor
the
soul
act
with
cheerfulness
i
might
here
mention
the
effects
which
this
has
upon
all
the
faculties
of
the
mind
by
keeping
the
understanding
clear
the
imagination
untroubled
and
refining
those
spirits
that
are
necessary
for
the
proper
exertion
of
our
intellectual
faculties
during
the
present
laws
of
union
between
soul
and
body
it
is
to
a
neglect
in
this
particular
that
we
must
ascribe
the
spleen
which
is
so
frequent
in
men
of
studious
and
sedentary
tempers
as
well
as
the
vapours
to
which
those
of
the
other
sex
are
so
often
subject
had
not
exercise
been
absolutely
necessary
for
our
nature
would
not
have
made
the
body
so
proper
for
it
by
giving
such
an
activity
to
the
limbs
and
such
a
pliancy
to
every
part
as
necessarily
produce
these
compressions
extensions
contortions
dilatations
and
all
other
kinds
of
motions
that
are
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
such
a
system
of
tubes
and
glands
as
has
been
before
mentioned
and
that
we
might
not
want
inducements
to
engage
us
in
such
an
exercise
of
the
body
as
is
proper
for
its
welfare
it
is
so
ordered
that
nothing
valuable
can
be
procured
without
it
not
to
mention
riches
and
honour
even
food
and
raiment
are
not
to
be
come
at
without
the
toil
of
the
hands
and
sweat
of
the
brows
providence
furnishes
materials
but
expects
that
we
should
work
them
up
ourselves
the
earth
must
be
laboured
before
it
gives
its
increase
and
when
it
is
forced
into
its
several
products
how
many
hands
must
they
pass
through
before
they
are
fit

my
friend
sir
roger
has
been
an
indefatigable
man
in
business
of
this
kind
and
has
hung
several
parts
of
his
house
with
the
trophies
of
his
former
labours
the
walls
of
his
great
hall
are
covered
with
the
horns
of
several
kinds
of
deer
that
he
has
killed
in
the
chace
which
he
thinks
the
most
valuable
furniture
of
his
house
as
they
afford
him
frequent
topics
of
discourse
and
shew
that
he
has
not
been
idle
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
is
a
large
otter
skin
stuffed
with
hay
which
his
mother
ordered
to
be
hung
up
in
that
manner
and
the
knight
looks
upon
it
with
great
satisfaction
because
it
seems
he
was
but
nine
years
old
when
his
dog
killed
him
a
little
room
adjoining
to
the
hall
is
a
kind
of
arsenal
filled
with
guns
of
several
sizes
and
inventions
with
which
the
knight
has
made
great
havock
in
the
woods
and
destroyed
many
thousands
of
pheasants
partridges
and
woodcocks
his
are
patched
with
noses
that
belonged
to
foxes
of
the
knight
own
hunting
down
sir
roger
shewed
me
one
of
them
that
for
distinction
sake
has
a
brass
nail
struck
through
it
which
cost
him
about
fifteen
hours
riding
carried
him
through
half
a
dozen
counties
killed
him
a
brace
of
geldings
and
lost
above
half
his
dogs
this
the
knight
looks
upon
as
one
of
the
greatest
exploits
of
his
life
the
perverse
widow
whom
i
have
given
some
account
of
was
the
death
of
several
foxes
for
sir
roger
has
told
me
that
in
the
course
of
his
amours
he
patched
the
western
door
of
his
stable
whenever
the
widow
was
cruel
the
foxes
were
sure
to
pay
for
it
in
proportion
as
his
passion
for
the
widow
abated
and
old
age
came
on
he
left
off
but
a
hare
is
not
yet
safe
that
sits
within
ten
miles
of
his
house
there
is
no
kind
of
exercise
which
i
would
so
recommend
to
my
readers
of
both
sexes
as
this
of
riding
as
there
is
none
which
so
much
conduces
to
health
and
is
every
way
accommodated
to
the
body
according
to
the
idea
which
i
have
given
of
it
doctor
is
very
lavish
in
its
praises
and
if
the
reader
will
see
the
mechanical
effects
of
it
described
at
length
he
may
find
them
in
a
book
published
not
many
years
since
under
the
title
of
for
my
own
part
when
i
am
in
town
for
want
of
these
opportunities
i
exercise
myself
an
hour
every
morning
upon
a
dumb
bell
that
is
placed
in
a
corner
of
my
room
and
pleases
me
the
more
because
it
does
every
thing
i
require
of
it
in
the
most
profound
silence
my
landlady
and
her
daughters
are
so
well
acquainted
with
my
hours
of
exercise
that
they
never
come
into
my
room
to
disturb
me
whilst
i
am
ringing
when
i
was
some
years
younger
than
i
am
at
present
i
used
to
employ
myself
in
a
more
laborious
diversion
which
i
learned
from
a
latin
treatise
of
exercises
that
is
written
with
great
erudition
it
is
there
called
the
skiomachia
or
the
fighting
with
a
man
own
shadow
and
consists
in
the
brandishing
of
two
short
sticks
grasped
in
each
hand
and
loaden
with
plugs
of
lead
at
either
end
this
opens
the
chest
exercises
the
limbs
and
gives
a
man
all
the
pleasure
of
boxing
without
the
blows
i
could
wish
that
several
learned
men
would
lay
out
that
time
which
they
employ
in
controversies
and
disputes
about
nothing
in
this
method
of
fighting
with
their
own
shadows
it
might
conduce
very
much
to
evaporate
the
spleen
which
makes
them
uneasy
to
the
public
as
well
as
to
themselves
to
conclude
as
i
am
a
compound
of
soul
and
body
i
consider
myself
as
obliged
to
a
double
scheme
of
duties
and
think
i
have
not
fulfilled
the
business
of
the
day
when
i
do
not
thus
employ
the
one
in
labour
and
exercise
as
well
as
the
other
in

the

invite
those
who
have
searched
into
human
nature
observe
that
nothing
so
much
shews
the
nobleness
of
the
soul
as
that
its
felicity
consists
in
action
every
man
has
such
an
active
principle
in
him
that
he
will
find
out
something
to
employ
himself
upon
in
whatever
place
or
state
of
life
he
is
posted
i
have
heard
of
a
gentleman
who
was
under
close
confinement
in
the
seven
years
during
which
time
he
amused
himself
in
scattering
a
few
small
pins
about
his
chamber
gathering
them
up
again
and
placing
them
in
different
figures
on
the
arm
of
a
great
chair
he
often
told
his
friends
afterwards
that
unless
he
had
found
out
this
piece
of
exercise
he
verily
believed
he
should
have
lost
his
senses
after
what
has
been
said
i
need
not
inform
my
readers
that
sir
roger
with
whose
character
i
hope
they
are
at
present
pretty
well
acquainted
has
in
his
youth
gone
through
the
whole
course
of
those
rural
diversions
which
the
country
abounds
in
and
which
seem
to
be
extremely
well
suited
to
that
laborious
industry
a
man
may
observe
here
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
in
towns
and
cities
i
have
before
hinted
at
some
of
my
friend
exploits
he
has
in
his
youthful
days
taken
forty
coveys
of
partridges
in
a
season
and
tired
many
a
salmon
with
a
line
consisting
but
of
a
single
hair
the
constant
thanks
and
good
wishes
of
the
neighbourhood
always
attended
him
on
account
of
his
remarkable
enmity
towards
foxes
having
destroyed
more
of
those
vermin
in
one
year
than
it
was
thought
the
whole
country
could
have
produced
indeed
the
knight
does
not
scruple
to
own
among
his
most
intimate
friends
that
in
order
to
establish
his
reputation
this
way
he
has
secretly
sent
for
great
numbers
of
them
out
of
other
counties
which
he
used
to
turn
loose
about
the
country
by
night
that
he
might
the
better
signalize
himself
in
their
destruction
the
next
day
his
were
the
finest
and
best
managed
in
all
these
parts
his
tenants
are
still
full
of
the
praises
of
a
grey
that
unhappily
staked
himself
several
years
since
and
was
buried
with
great
solemnity
in
the
orchard
sir
roger
being
at
present
too
old
for
to
keep
himself
in
action
has
disposed
of
his
beagles
and
got
a
pack
of
what
these
want
in
speed
he
endeavours
to
make
amends
for
by
the
deepness
of
their
mouths
and
the
variety
of
their
notes
which
are
suited
in
such
manner
to
each
other
that
the
whole
cry
makes
up
a
complete
concert
he
is
so
nice
in
this
particular
that
a
gentleman
having
made
him
a
present
of
a
very
fine
hound
the
other
day
the
knight
returned
it
by
the
servant
with
a
great
many
expressions
of
civility
but
desired
him
to
tell
his
master
that
the
dog
he
had
sent
was
indeed
a
most
excellent
but
that
at
present
he
only
wanted
a
could
i
believe
my
friend
had
ever
read
i
should
certainly
conclude
he
had
taken
the
hint
from
in
midsummer
night
hounds
are
bred
out
of
spartan
so
flu
so
sanded
and
their
heads
are
hung
with
ears
that
sweep
away
the
morning
dew
and
thessalian
slow
in
pursuit
but
matched
in
mouths
like
bells
each
under
each
a
cry
more
tuneable
was
never
halloo
to
nor
cheer
with
sir
roger
is
so
keen
at
this
sport
that
he
has
been
out
almost
every
day
since
i
came
down
and
upon
the
chaplain
offering
to
lend
me
his
easy
pad
i
was
prevailed
on
yesterday
morning
to
make
one
of
the
company
i
was
extremely
pleased
as
we
rid
along
to
observe
the
general
benevolence
of
all
the
neighbourhood
towards
my
friend
the
farmer
sons
thought
themselves
happy
if
they
could
open
a
gate
for
the
good
old
knight
as
he
passed
by
which
he
generally
requited
with
a
nod
or
a
smile
and
a
kind
inquiry
after
their
fathers
and
uncles
after
we
had
rid
about
a
mile
from
home
we
came
upon
a
large
heath
and
the
sportsmen
began
to
beat
they
had
done
so
for
some
time
when
as
i
was
at
a
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
company
i
saw
a
hare
pop
out
from
a
small
almost
under
my
horse
feet
i
marked
the
way
she
took
which
i
endeavoured
to
make
the
company
sensible
of
by
extending
my
arm
but
to
no
purpose
until
sir
roger
who
knows
that
none
of
my
extraordinary
motions
are
insignificant
rode
up
to
me
and
asked
me
puss
was
gone
that
way
upon
my
answering
he
immediately
called
in
the
dogs
and
put
them
upon
the
scent
as
they
were
going
off
i
heard
one
of
the
muttering
to
his
companion
it
was
a
wonder
they
had
not
lost
all
their
sport
for
want
of
the
silent
gentleman
crying
stole
this
with
my
aversion
to
leaping
hedges
made
me
withdraw
to
a
rising
ground
from
whence
i
could
have
the
pleasure
of
the
whole
chace
without
the
fatigue
of
keeping
in
with
the
hounds
the
hare
immediately
threw
them
above
a
mile
behind
her
but
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
instead
of
running
straight
forwards
or
in
hunter
language
the
as
i
was
afraid
she
might
have
done
she
wheeled
about
and
described
a
sort
of
circle
round
the
hill
where
i
had
taken
my
station
in
such
manner
as
gave
me
a
very
distinct
view
of
the
sport
i
could
see
her
first
pass
by
and
the
dogs
some
time
afterwards
unravelling
the
whole
track
she
had
made
and
following
her
through
all
her
doubles
i
was
at
the
same
time
delighted
in
observing
that
deference
which
the
rest
of
the
pack
paid
to
each
particular
hound
according
to
the
character
he
had
acquired
amongst
them
if
they
were
at
a
fault
and
an
old
hound
of
reputation
opened
but
once
he
was
immediately
followed
by
the
whole
cry
while
a
raw
dog
or
one
who
was
a
noted
might
have
yelped
his
heart
out
without
being
taken
notice
of
the
hare
now
after
having
squatted
two
or
three
times
and
been
put
up
again
as
often
came
still
nearer
to
the
place
where
she
was
at
first
started
the
dogs
pursued
her
and
these
were
followed
by
the
jolly
knight
who
rode
upon
a
white
gelding
encompassed
by
his
tenants
and
servants
and
cheering
his
hounds
with
all
the
gaiety
of
five
and
twenty
one
of
the
sportsmen
rode
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
he
was
sure
the
chace
was
almost
at
an
end
because
the
old
dogs
which
had
hitherto
lain
behind
now
headed
the
pack
the
fellow
was
in
the
right
our
hare
took
a
large
field
just
under
us
followed
by
the
full
cry
i
must
confess
the
brightness
of
the
weather
the
cheerfulness
of
every
thing
around
me
the
of
the
hounds
which
was
returned
upon
us
in
a
double
echo
from
two
neighbouring
hills
with
the
hallooing
of
the
sportsmen
and
the
sounding
of
the
horn
lifted
my
spirits
into
a
most
lively
pleasure
which
i
freely
indulged
because
i
knew
it
was
if
i
was
under
any
concern
it
was
on
the
account
of
the
poor
hare
that
was
now
quite
spent
and
almost
within
the
reach
of
her
enemies
when
the
huntsman
getting
forward
threw
down
his
pole
before
the
dogs
they
were
now
within
eight
yards
of
that
game
which
they
had
been
pursuing
for
almost
as
many
hours
yet
on
the
signal
they
all
made
a
sudden
stand
and
though
they
continued
opening
as
much
as
before
durst
not
once
attempt
to
pass
beyond
the
pole
at
the
same
time
sir
roger
rode
forward
and
alighting
took
up
the
hare
in
his
arms
which
he
soon
delivered
to
one
of
his
servants
with
an
order
if
she
could
be
kept
alive
to
let
her
go
in
his
great
orchard
where
it
seems
he
has
several
of
these
prisoners
of
war
who
live
together
in
a
very
comfortable
captivity
i
was
highly
pleased
to
see
the
discipline
of
the
pack
and
the
good
nature
of
the
knight
who
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
murder
a
creature
that
had
given
him
so
much
diversion
as
we
were
returning
home
i
remembered
that
monsieur
in
his
most
excellent
discourse
on
misery
of
tells
us
that
our
endeavours
after
greatness
proceed
from
nothing
but
a
desire
of
being
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
persons
and
affairs
that
may
hinder
us
from
looking
into
ourselves
which
is
a
view
we
can
not
he
afterwards
goes
on
to
show
that
our
love
of
sports
comes
from
the
same
reason
and
is
particularly
severe
upon
hunting
says
he
it
be
to
drown
thought
can
make
men
throw
away
so
much
time
and
pains
upon
a
silly
animal
which
they
might
buy
cheaper
in
the
market
the
foregoing
reflection
is
certainly
just
when
a
man
suffers
his
whole
mind
to
be
drawn
into
his
sports
and
altogether
loses
himself
in
the
woods
but
does
not
affect
those
who
propose
a
far
more
laudable
end
for
this
exercise
i
mean
preservation
of
health
and
keeping
all
the
organs
of
the
soul
in
a
condition
to
execute
her
had
that
incomparable
person
whom
i
last
quoted
been
a
little
more
indulgent
to
himself
in
this
point
the
world
might
probably
have
enjoyed
him
much
longer
whereas
through
too
great
an
application
to
his
studies
in
his
youth
he
contracted
that
ill
habit
of
body
which
after
a
tedious
sickness
carried
him
off
in
the
fortieth
year
of
his
age
and
the
whole
history
we
have
of
his
life
till
that
time
is
but
one
continued
account
of
the
behaviour
of
a
noble
soul
struggling
under
innumerable
pains
and
distempers
for
my
own
part
i
intend
to
hunt
twice
a
week
during
my
stay
with
sir
roger
and
shall
prescribe
the
moderate
use
of
this
exercise
to
all
my
country
friends
as
the
best
kind
of
physick
for
mending
a
bad
constitution

preserving
a

one

consider
that
the
ignorant
and
credulous
parts
of
the
world
abound
most
in
these
relations
and
that
the
persons
among
us
who
are
supposed
to
engage
in
such
an
infernal
commerce
are
people
of
a
weak
understanding
and
crazed
imagination
and
at
the
same
time
reflect
upon
the
many
impostures
and
delusions
of
this
nature
that
have
been
detected
in
all
ages
i
endeavour
to
suspend
my
belief
till
i
hear
more
certain
accounts
than
any
which
have
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
in
short
when
i
consider
the
question
whether
there
are
such
persons
in
the
world
as
those
we
call
witches
my
mind
is
divided
between
the
two
opposite
opinions
or
rather
to
speak
my
thoughts
freely
i
believe
in
general
that
there
is
and
has
been
such
a
thing
as
witchcraft
but
at
the
same
time
can
give
no
credit
to
any
particular
instance
of
it
i
am
engaged
in
this
speculation
by
some
occurrences
that
i
met
with
yesterday
which
i
shall
give
my
reader
an
account
of
at
large
as
i
was
walking
with
my
friend
sir
roger
by
the
side
of
one
of
his
woods
an
old
woman
applied
herself
to
me
for
my
charity
her
dress
and
figure
put
me
in
mind
of
the
following
description
in
a
close
lane
as
i
pursu
my
journey
i
spy
a
hag
age
grown
double
picking
dry
sticks
and
mumbling
to
herself
her
eyes
with
scalding
rheum
were
gall
and
red
cold
palsy
shook
her
head
her
hands
seem
withered
and
on
her
crooked
shoulders
had
she
wrapped
the
tatter
remnants
of
an
old
strip
hanging
which
serv
to
keep
her
carcase
from
the
cold
so
there
was
nothing
of
a
piece
about
her
her
lower
weeds
were
all
coarsly
with
rags
black
red
white
yellow
and
seem
to
speak
variety
of
as
i
was
musing
on
this
description
and
comparing
it
with
the
object
before
me
the
knight
told
me
that
this
very
old
woman
had
the
reputation
of
a
witch
all
over
the
country
that
her
lips
were
observed
to
be
always
in
motion
and
that
there
was
not
a
switch
about
her
house
which
her
neighbours
did
not
believe
had
carried
her
several
hundreds
of
miles
if
she
chanced
to
stumble
they
always
found
sticks
or
straws
that
lay
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
before
her
if
she
made
any
mistake
at
church
and
cried
in
a
wrong
place
they
never
failed
to
conclude
that
she
was
saying
her
prayers
backwards
there
was
not
a
maid
in
the
parish
that
would
take
a
pin
of
her
though
she
should
offer
a
bag
of
money
with
it
she
goes
by
the
name
of
and
has
made
the
country
ring
with
several
imaginary
exploits
which
are
palmed
upon
her
if
the
does
not
make
the
butter
come
so
soon
as
she
would
have
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
churn
if
a
horse
sweats
in
the
stable
has
been
upon
his
back
if
a
hare
makes
an
unexpected
escape
from
the
hounds
the
huntsman
curses
says
sir
roger
have
known
the
master
of
the
pack
upon
such
an
occasion
send
one
of
his
servants
to
see
if
had
been
out
that
morning
this
account
raised
my
curiosity
so
far
that
i
begged
my
friend
sir
roger
to
go
with
me
into
her
hovel
which
stood
in
a
solitary
corner
under
the
side
of
the
wood
upon
our
first
entering
sir
roger
winked
to
me
and
pointed
at
something
that
stood
behind
the
door
which
upon
looking
that
way
i
found
to
be
an
old
broomstaff
at
the
same
time
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
to
take
notice
of
a
tabby
cat
that
sat
in
the
which
as
the
old
knight
told
me
lay
under
as
bad
a
report
as
herself
for
besides
that
is
said
often
to
accompany
her
in
the
same
shape
the
cat
is
reported
to
have
spoken
twice
or
thrice
in
her
life
and
to
have
played
several
pranks
above
the
capacity
of
an
ordinary
cat
i
was
secretly
concerned
to
see
human
nature
in
so
much
wretchedness
and
disgrace
but
at
the
same
time
could
not
forbear
smiling
to
hear
sir
roger
who
is
a
little
puzzled
about
the
old
woman
advising
her
as
a
justice
of
peace
to
avoid
all
communication
with
the
devil
and
never
to
hurt
any
of
her
neighbour
cattle
we
concluded
our
visit
with
a
bounty
which
was
very
acceptable
in
our
return
home
sir
roger
told
me
that
old
had
been
often
brought
before
him
for
making
children
spit
pins
and
giving
maids
the
nightmare
and
that
the
country
people
would
be
tossing
her
into
a
pond
and
trying
experiments
with
her
every
day
if
it
was
not
for
him
and
his
chaplain
i
have
since
found
upon
inquiry
that
sir
roger
was
several
times
staggered
with
the
reports
that
had
been
brought
him
concerning
this
old
woman
and
would
frequently
have
bound
her
over
to
the
had
not
his
chaplain
with
much
ado
persuaded
him
to
the
contrary
i
have
been
the
more
particular
in
this
account
because
i
hear
there
is
scarce
a
village
in
that
has
not
a
in
it
when
an
old
woman
begins
to
dote
and
grow
chargeable
to
a
parish
she
is
generally
turned
into
a
witch
and
fills
the
whole
country
with
extravagant
fancies
imaginary
distempers
and
terrifying
dreams
in
the
mean
time
the
poor
wretch
that
is
the
innocent
occasion
of
so
many
evils
begins
to
be
frighted
at
herself
and
sometimes
confesses
secret
commerce
and
familiarities
that
her
imagination
forms
in
a
delirious
old
age
this
frequently
cuts
off
charity
from
the
greatest
objects
of
compassion
and
inspires
people
with
a
malevolence
towards
those
poor
decrepid
parts
of
our
species
in
whom
human
nature
is
defaced
by
infirmity

dryden
this
agreeable
seat
is
surrounded
with
so
many
pleasing
walks
which
are
struck
out
of
a
wood
in
the
midst
of
which
the
house
stands
that
one
can
hardly
ever
be
weary
of
rambling
from
one
labyrinth
of
delight
to
another
to
one
used
to
live
in
a
city
the
charms
of
the
country
are
so
exquisite
that
the
mind
is
lost
in
a
certain
transport
which
raises
us
above
ordinary
life
and
is
yet
not
strong
enough
to
be
inconsistent
with
tranquillity
this
state
of
mind
was
i
in
ravished
with
the
murmur
of
waters
the
whisper
of
breezes
the
singing
of
birds
and
whether
i
looked
up
to
the
heavens
down
to
the
earth
or
turned
on
the
prospects
around
me
still
struck
with
new
sense
of
pleasure
when
i
found
by
the
voice
of
my
friend
who
walked
by
me
that
we
had
insensibly
strolled
into
the
grove
sacred
to
the
widow
woman
says
he
of
all
others
the
most
unintelligible
she
either
designs
to
marry
or
she
does
not
what
is
the
most
perplexing
of
all
is
that
she
doth
not
either
say
to
her
lovers
she
has
any
resolution
against
that
condition
of
life
in
general
or
that
she
banishes
them
but
conscious
of
her
own
merit
she
permits
their
addresses
without
fear
of
any
ill
consequence
or
want
of
respect
from
their
rage
or
despair
she
has
that
in
her
aspect
against
which
it
is
impossible
to
offend
a
man
whose
thoughts
are
constantly
bent
upon
so
agreeable
an
object
must
be
excused
if
the
ordinary
occurrences
in
conversation
are
below
his
attention
i
call
her
indeed
perverse
but
alas
why
do
i
call
her
so
because
her
superior
merit
is
such
that
i
can
not
approach
her
without
awe
that
my
heart
is
checked
by
too
much
esteem
i
am
angry
that
her
charms
are
not
more
acceptable
that
i
am
more
inclined
to
worship
than
salute
her
how
often
have
i
wished
her
unhappy
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
serving
her
and
how
often
troubled
in
that
very
imagination
at
giving
her
the
pain
of
being
obliged
well
i
have
led
a
miserable
life
in
secret
upon
her
account
but
fancy
she
would
have
condescended
to
have
some
regard
for
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
watchful
animal
her
confident
all
persons
under
the
sun
continued
he
calling
me
by
my
name
be
sure
to
set
a
mark
upon
confidents
they
are
of
all
people
the
most
impertinent
what
is
most
pleasant
to
observe
in
them
is
that
they
assume
to
themselves
the
merit
of
the
persons
whom
they
have
in
their
custody
is
a
great
fortune
and
in
wonderful
danger
of
surprises
therefore
full
of
suspicions
of
the
least
indifferent
thing
particularly
careful
of
new
acquaintance
and
of
growing
too
familiar
with
the
old
her
favourite
woman
is
every
whit
as
careful
of
whom
she
speaks
to
and
what
she
says
let
the
ward
be
a
beauty
her
confident
shall
treat
you
with
an
air
of
distance
let
her
be
a
fortune
and
she
assumes
the
suspicious
behaviour
of
her
friend
and
patroness
thus
it
is
that
very
many
of
our
unmarried
women
of
distinction
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
married
except
the
consideration
of
different
sexes
they
are
directly
under
the
conduct
of
their
whisperer
and
think
they
are
in
a
state
of
freedom
while
they
can
prate
with
one
of
these
attendants
of
all
men
in
general
and
still
avoid
the
man
they
most
like
you
do
not
see
one
heiress
in
a
hundred
whose
fate
does
not
turn
upon
this
circumstance
of
chusing
a
confident
thus
it
is
that
the
lady
is
addressed
to
presented
and
flattered
only
by
proxy
in
her
woman
in
my
case
how
is
it
possible
that
sir
roger
was
proceeding
in
his
harangue
when
we
heard
the
voice
of
one
speaking
very
importunately
and
repeating
these
words
not
one
smile
we
followed
the
sound
till
we
came
to
a
close
thicket
on
the
other
side
of
which
we
saw
a
young
woman
sitting
as
it
were
in
a
personated
sullenness
just
over
a
transparent
fountain
opposite
to
her
stood
sir
roger
master
of
the
game
the
knight
whispered
me
these
are
lovers
the
huntsman
looking
earnestly
at
the
shadow
of
the
young
maiden
in
the
stream
thou
dear
picture
if
thou
couldst
remain
there
in
the
absence
of
that
fair
creature
whom
you
represent
in
the
water
how
willingly
could
i
stand
here
satisfied
for
ever
without
troubling
my
dear
herself
with
any
mention
of
her
unfortunate
whom
she
is
angry
with
but
alas
when
she
pleases
to
be
gone
thou
wilt
also
vanish
yet
let
me
talk
to
thee
while
thou
dost
stay
tell
my
dearest
thou
dost
not
more
depend
upon
her
than
does
her
her
absence
will
make
away
with
me
as
well
as
thee
if
she
offers
to
remove
thee
i
will
jump
into
these
waves
to
lay
hold
on
thee
herself
her
own
dear
person
i
must
never
embrace
still
do
you
hear
me
without
one
smile
it
is
too
much
to
bear
he
had
no
sooner
spoke
these
words
but
he
made
an
offer
of
throwing
himself
into
the
water
at
which
his
mistress
started
up
and
at
the
next
instant
he
jumped
across
the
fountain
and
met
her
in
an
embrace
she
half
recovering
from
her
fright
said
in
the
most
charming
voice
imaginable
and
with
a
tone
of
complaint
thought
how
well
you
would
drown
yourself
no
no
you
wo
drown
yourself
till
you
have
taken
your
leave
of
the
huntsman
with
a
tenderness
that
spoke
the
most
passionate
love
and
with
his
cheek
close
to
hers
whispered
the
softest
vows
of
fidelity
in
her
ear
and
cried
my
dear
believe
a
word
says
she
is
spiteful
and
makes
stories
because
she
loves
to
hear
me
talk
to
herself
for
your
sake
you
there
quoth
sir
roger
you
see
there
all
mischief
comes
from
confidents
but
let
us
not
interrupt
them
the
maid
is
honest
and
the
man
dares
not
be
otherwise
for
he
knows
i
loved
her
father
i
will
interpose
in
this
matter
and
hasten
the
wedding
is
a
witty
mischievous
wench
in
the
neighbourhood
who
was
a
beauty
and
makes
me
hope
i
shall
see
the
perverse
widow
in
her
condition
she
was
so
flippant
with
her
answers
to
all
the
honest
fellows
that
came
near
her
and
so
very
vain
of
her
beauty
that
she
has
valued
herself
upon
her
charms
till
they
are
ceased
she
therefore
now
makes
it
her
business
to
prevent
other
young
women
from
being
more
discreet
than
she
was
herself
however
the
saucy
thing
said
the
other
day
well
enough
sir
roger
and
i
must
make
a
match
for
we
are
both
despised
by
those
we
loved
the
hussy
has
a
great
deal
of
power
wherever
she
comes
and
has
her
share
of
cunning
when
i
reflect
upon
this
woman
i
do
not
know
whether
in
the
main
i
am
the
worse
for
having
loved
her
whenever
she
is
recalled
to
my
imagination
my
youth
returns
and
i
feel
a
forgotten
warmth
in
my
veins
this
affliction
in
my
life
has
streaked
all
my
conduct
with
a
softness
of
which
i
should
otherwise
have
been
incapable
it
is
perhaps
to
this
dear
image
in
my
heart
owing
that
i
am
apt
to
relent
that
i
easily
forgive
and
that
many
desirable
things
are
grown
into
my
temper
which
i
should
not
have
arrived
at
by
better
motives
than
the
thought
of
being
one
day
hers
i
am
pretty
well
satisfied
such
a
passion
as
i
have
had
is
never
well
cured
and
between
you
and
me
i
am
often
apt
to
imagine
it
has
had
some
whimsical
effect
upon
my
brain
for
i
frequently
find
that
in
my
most
serious
discourse
i
let
fall
some
comical
familiarity
of
speech
or
odd
phrase
that
makes
the
company
laugh
however
i
can
not
but
allow
she
is
a
most
excellent
woman
when
she
is
in
the
country
i
warrant
she
does
not
run
into
dairies
but
reads
upon
the
nature
of
plants
but
has
a
and
comes
into
the
garden
out
of
books
to
see
them
work
and
observe
the
policies
of
their
commonwealth
she
understands
every
thing
i
would
give
ten
pounds
to
hear
her
argue
with
my
friend
sir
andrew
freeport
about
trade
no
no
for
all
she
looks
so
innocent
as
it
were
take
my
word
for
it
she

like
dryden
the
first
and
most
obvious
reflexions
which
arise
in
a
man
who
changes
the
city
for
the
country
are
upon
the
different
manners
of
the
people
whom
he
meets
with
in
those
two
different
scenes
of
life
by
manners
i
do
not
mean
morals
but
behaviour
and
as
they
shew
themselves
in
the
town
and
in
the
country
and
here
in
the
first
place
i
must
observe
a
very
great
revolution
that
has
happened
in
this
article
of
several
obliging
deferences
condescensions
and
submissions
with
many
outward
forms
and
ceremonies
that
accompany
them
were
first
of
all
brought
up
among
the
politer
part
of
mankind
who
lived
in
courts
and
cities
and
distinguished
themselves
from
the
rustick
part
of
the
species
who
on
all
occasions
acted
bluntly
and
naturally
by
such
a
mutual
complaisance
and
intercourse
of
civilities
these
forms
of
conversation
by
degrees
multiplied
and
grew
troublesome
the
modish
world
found
too
great
a
constraint
in
them
and
have
therefore
thrown
most
of
them
aside
conversation
like
the
religion
was
so
incumbered
with
show
and
ceremony
that
it
stood
in
need
of
a
reformation
to
retrench
its
superfluities
and
restore
it
to
its
natural
good
sense
and
beauty
at
present
therefore
an
unconstrained
carriage
and
a
certain
openness
of
behaviour
are
the
height
of
the
fashionable
world
is
grown
free
and
easy
our
manners
sit
more
loose
upon
us
nothing
is
so
modish
as
an
agreeable
negligence
in
a
word
shews
itself
most
where
to
an
ordinary
eye
it
appears
the
least
if
after
this
we
look
on
the
people
of
mode
in
the
country
we
find
in
them
the
manners
of
the
last
age
they
have
no
sooner
fetched
themselves
up
to
the
fashion
of
the
polite
world
but
the
town
has
dropped
them
and
are
nearer
to
the
first
state
of
nature
than
to
those
refinements
which
formerly
reigned
in
the
court
and
still
prevail
in
the
country
one
may
now
know
a
man
that
never
conversed
in
the
world
by
his
excess
of
a
polite
country
shall
make
you
as
many
bows
in
half
an
hour
as
would
serve
a
courtier
for
a
week
there
is
infinitely
more
to
do
about
place
and
precedency
in
a
meeting
of
justices
wives
than
in
an
assembly
of
duchesses
this
rural
politeness
is
very
troublesome
to
a
man
of
my
temper
who
generally
take
the
chair
that
is
next
me
and
walk
first
or
last
in
the
front
or
in
the
rear
as
chance
directs
i
have
known
my
friend
sir
roger
dinner
almost
cold
before
the
company
could
adjust
the
ceremonial
and
be
prevailed
upon
to
sit
down
and
have
heartily
pitied
my
old
friend
when
i
have
seen
him
forced
to
pick
and
cull
his
guests
as
they
sat
at
the
several
parts
of
his
table
that
he
might
drink
their
healths
according
to
their
respective
ranks
and
qualities
honest
who
i
should
have
thought
had
been
altogether
uninfected
with
ceremony
gives
me
abundance
of
trouble
in
this
particular
though
he
has
been
fishing
all
the
morning
he
will
not
help
himself
at
dinner
till
i
am
served
when
we
are
going
out
of
the
hall
he
runs
behind
me
and
last
night
as
we
were
walking
in
the
fields
stopped
short
at
a
stile
till
i
came
up
to
it
and
upon
my
making
signs
to
him
to
get
over
told
me
with
a
serious
smile
that
sure
i
believed
they
had
no
manners
in
the
country
there
has
happened
another
revolution
in
the
point
of
which
relates
to
the
conversation
among
men
of
mode
and
which
i
can
not
but
look
upon
as
very
extraordinary
it
was
certainly
one
of
the
first
distinctions
of
a
man
to
express
every
thing
that
had
the
most
remote
appearance
of
being
obscene
in
modest
terms
and
distant
phrases
whilst
the
clown
who
had
no
such
delicacy
of
conception
and
expression
clothed
his
in
those
plain
homely
terms
that
are
the
most
obvious
and
natural
this
kind
of
was
perhaps
carried
to
an
excess
so
as
to
make
conversation
too
stiff
formal
and
precise
for
which
reason
as
hypocrisy
in
one
age
is
generally
succeeded
by
atheism
in
another
conversation
is
in
a
great
measure
relapsed
into
the
first
extreme
so
that
at
present
several
of
our
men
of
the
town
and
particularly
those
who
have
been
polished
in
make
use
of
the
most
coarse
uncivilized
words
in
our
language
and
utter
themselves
often
in
such
a
manner
as
a
clown
would
blush
to
hear
this
infamous
piece
of
which
reigns
among
the
coxcombs
of
the
town
has
not
yet
made
its
way
into
the
country
and
as
it
is
impossible
for
such
an
irrational
way
of
conversation
to
last
long
among
a
people
that
make
any
profession
of
religion
or
show
of
modesty
if
the
country
gentlemen
get
into
it
they
will
certainly
be
left
in
the
lurch
their
will
come
too
late
to
them
and
they
will
be
thought
a
parcel
of
lewd
clowns
while
they
fancy
themselves
talking
together
like
men
of
wit
and
pleasure
as
the
two
points
of
which
i
have
hitherto
insisted
upon
regard
behaviour
and
conversation
there
is
a
third
which
turns
upon
dress
in
this
too
the
country
are
very
much
the
rural
beaux
are
not
yet
got
out
of
the
fashion
that
took
place
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
but
ride
about
the
country
in
red
coats
and
laced
hats
while
the
women
in
many
parts
are
still
trying
to
outvie
one
another
in
the
height
of
their
headdresses
but
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
now
upon
the
western
circuit
having
promised
to
give
me
an
account
of
the
several
modes
and
fashions
that
prevail
in
the
different
parts
of
the
nation
through
which
he
passes
i
shall
defer
the
enlarging
upon
this
last
topick
till
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
which
i
expect
every
post

my
friend
sir
roger
is
very
often
merry
with
me
upon
my
passing
so
much
of
my
time
among
his
poultry
he
has
caught
me
twice
or
thrice
looking
after
a
bird
nest
and
several
times
sitting
an
hour
or
two
together
near
an
hen
and
chickens
he
tells
me
he
believes
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
every
fowl
about
his
house
calls
such
a
particular
cock
my
favourite
and
frequently
complains
that
his
ducks
and
geese
have
more
of
my
company
than
himself
i
must
confess
i
am
infinitely
delighted
with
those
speculations
of
nature
which
are
to
be
made
in
a
and
as
my
reading
has
very
much
lain
among
books
of
natural
history
i
can
not
forbear
recollecting
upon
this
occasion
the
several
remarks
which
i
have
met
with
in
authors
and
comparing
them
with
what
falls
under
my
own
observation
the
argument
for
providence
drawn
from
the
natural
history
of
animals
being
in
my
opinion
demonstrative
the
make
of
every
kind
of
animal
is
different
from
that
of
every
other
kind
and
yet
there
is
not
the
least
turn
in
the
muscles
or
twist
in
the
fibres
of
any
one
which
does
not
render
them
more
proper
for
that
particular
animal
way
of
life
than
any
other
cast
or
texture
of
them
would
have
been
the
most
violent
appetites
in
all
creatures
are
and
the
first
is
a
perpetual
call
upon
them
to
propagate
their
kind
the
latter
to
preserve
themselves
it
is
astonishing
to
consider
the
different
degrees
of
care
that
descend
from
the
parent
to
the
young
so
far
as
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
leaving
a
posterity
some
creatures
cast
their
eggs
as
chance
directs
them
and
think
of
them
no
farther
as
insects
and
several
kinds
of
fish
others
of
a
nicer
frame
find
out
proper
beds
to
deposite
them
in
and
there
leave
them
as
the
serpent
the
crocodile
and
ostrich
others
hatch
their
eggs
and
tend
the
birth
till
it
is
able
to
shift
for
itself
what
can
we
call
the
principle
which
directs
every
different
kind
of
bird
to
observe
a
particular
plan
in
the
structure
of
its
nest
and
direct
all
the
same
species
to
work
after
the
same
model
it
can
not
be
for
though
you
hatch
a
crow
under
a
hen
and
never
let
it
see
any
of
the
works
of
its
own
kind
the
nest
it
makes
shall
be
the
same
to
the
laying
of
a
stick
with
all
the
other
nests
of
the
same
species
it
can
not
be
for
were
animals
indued
with
it
to
as
great
a
degree
as
man
their
buildings
would
be
as
different
as
ours
according
to
the
different
conveniencies
that
they
would
propose
to
themselves
is
it
not
remarkable
that
the
same
temper
of
weather
which
raises
this
genial
warmth
in
animals
should
cover
the
trees
with
leaves
and
the
fields
with
grass
for
their
security
and
concealment
and
produce
such
infinite
swarms
of
insects
for
the
support
and
sustenance
of
their
respective
broods
is
it
not
wonderful
that
the
love
of
the
parent
should
be
so
violent
while
it
lasts
and
that
it
should
last
no
longer
than
is
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
young
the
violence
of
this
natural
love
is
exemplified
by
a
very
barbarous
experiment
which
i
shall
quote
at
length
as
i
find
it
in
an
excellent
author
and
hope
my
readers
will
pardon
the
mentioning
such
an
instance
of
cruelty
because
there
is
nothing
can
so
effectually
show
the
strength
of
that
principle
in
animals
of
which
i
am
here
speaking
person
who
was
well
skilled
in
dissections
opened
a
bitch
and
as
she
lay
in
the
most
exquisite
tortures
offered
her
one
of
her
young
puppies
which
she
immediately
fell
a
licking
and
for
the
time
seemed
insensible
of
her
own
pain
on
the
removal
she
kept
her
eye
fixt
on
it
and
began
a
wailing
sort
of
cry
which
seemed
rather
to
proceed
from
the
loss
of
her
young
one
than
the
sense
of
her
own
torments
but
notwithstanding
this
natural
love
in
brutes
is
much
more
violent
and
intense
than
in
rational
creatures
providence
has
taken
care
that
it
should
be
no
longer
troublesome
to
the
parent
than
it
is
useful
to
the
young
for
so
soon
as
the
wants
of
the
latter
cease
the
mother
withdraws
her
fondness
and
leaves
them
to
provide
for
themselves
and
what
is
a
very
remarkable
circumstance
in
this
part
of
instinct
we
find
that
the
love
of
the
parent
may
be
lengthened
out
beyond
its
usual
time
if
the
preservation
of
the
species
requires
it
as
we
may
see
in
birds
that
drive
away
their
young
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
get
their
livelihood
but
continue
to
feed
them
if
they
are
tied
to
the
nest
or
confined
within
a
cage
or
by
any
other
means
appear
to
be
out
of
a
condition
of
supplying
their
own
necessities
this
natural
love
is
not
observed
in
animals
to
ascend
from
the
young
to
the
parent
which
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
the
continuance
of
the
species
nor
indeed
in
reasonable
creatures
does
it
rise
in
any
proportion
as
it
spreads
itself
downwards
for
in
all
family
affection
we
find
protection
granted
and
favours
bestowed
are
greater
motives
to
love
and
tenderness
than
safety
benefits
or
life
received
one
would
wonder
to
hear
sceptical
men
disputing
for
the
reason
of
animals
and
telling
us
it
is
only
our
pride
and
prejudices
that
will
not
allow
them
the
use
of
that
faculty
reason
shews
itself
in
all
occurrences
of
life
whereas
the
brute
makes
no
discovery
of
such
a
talent
but
in
what
immediately
regards
his
own
preservation
or
the
continuance
of
his
species
animals
in
their
generation
are
wiser
than
the
sons
of
men
but
their
wisdom
is
confined
to
a
few
particulars
and
lies
in
a
very
narrow
compass
take
a
brute
out
of
his
instinct
and
you
find
him
wholly
deprived
of
understanding
to
use
an
instance
that
comes
often
under
observation
with
what
caution
does
the
hen
provide
herself
a
nest
in
places
unfrequented
and
free
from
noise
and
disturbance
when
she
has
laid
her
eggs
in
such
a
manner
that
she
can
cover
them
what
care
does
she
take
in
turning
them
frequently
that
all
parts
may
partake
of
the
vital
warmth
when
she
leaves
them
to
provide
for
her
necessary
sustenance
how
punctually
does
she
return
before
they
have
time
to
cool
and
become
incapable
of
producing
an
animal
in
the
summer
you
see
her
giving
herself
greater
freedoms
and
quitting
her
care
for
above
two
hours
together
but
in
winter
when
the
rigour
of
the
season
would
chill
the
principles
of
life
and
destroy
the
young
one
she
grows
more
assiduous
in
her
attendance
and
stays
away
but
half
the
time
when
the
birth
approaches
with
how
much
nicety
and
attention
does
she
help
the
chick
to
break
its
prison
not
to
take
notice
of
her
covering
it
from
the
injuries
of
the
weather
providing
it
proper
nourishment
and
teaching
it
to
help
itself
nor
to
mention
her
forsaking
the
nest
if
after
the
usual
time
of
reckoning
the
young
one
does
not
make
its
appearance
a
chymical
operation
could
not
be
followed
with
greater
art
or
diligence
than
is
seen
in
the
hatching
of
a
chick
though
there
are
many
other
birds
that
shew
an
infinitely
greater
sagacity
in
all
the
forementioned
particulars
but
at
the
same
time
the
hen
that
has
all
this
seeming
ingenuity
which
is
indeed
absolutely
necessary
for
the
propagation
of
the
species
considered
in
other
respects
is
without
the
least
glimmerings
of
thought
or
common
sense
she
mistakes
a
piece
of
chalk
for
an
egg
and
sits
upon
it
in
the
same
manner
she
is
insensible
of
any
increase
or
diminution
in
the
number
of
those
she
lays
she
does
not
distinguish
between
her
own
and
those
of
another
species
and
when
the
birth
appears
of
never
so
different
a
bird
will
cherish
it
for
her
own
in
all
these
circumstances
which
do
not
carry
an
immediate
regard
to
the
subsistence
of
herself
or
her
species
she
is
a
very
idiot
there
is
not
in
my
opinion
any
thing
more
mysterious
in
nature
than
this
instinct
in
animals
which
thus
rises
above
reason
and
falls
infinitely
short
of
it
it
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
any
properties
in
matter
and
at
the
same
time
works
after
so
odd
a
manner
that
one
can
not
think
it
the
faculty
of
an
intellectual
being
for
my
own
part
i
look
upon
it
as
upon
the
principle
of
gravitation
in
bodies
which
is
not
to
be
explained
by
any
known
qualities
inherent
in
the
bodies
themselves
nor
from
any
laws
of
mechanism
but
according
to
the
best
notions
of
the
greatest
philosophers
is
an
immediate
impression
from
the
first
mover
and
the
divine
energy
acting
in
the
creatures

all
is
full
of
as
i
was
walking
this
morning
in
the
great
yard
that
belongs
to
my
friend
country
house
i
was
wonderfully
pleased
to
see
the
different
workings
of
instinct
in
a
hen
followed
by
a
brood
of
ducks
the
young
upon
the
sight
of
a
pond
immediately
ran
into
it
while
the
mother
with
all
imaginable
anxiety
hovered
about
the
borders
of
it
to
call
them
out
of
an
element
that
appeared
to
her
so
dangerous
and
destructive
as
the
different
principle
which
acted
in
these
different
animals
can
not
be
termed
reason
so
when
we
call
it
we
mean
something
we
have
no
knowledge
of
to
me
as
i
hinted
in
my
last
paper
it
seems
the
immediate
direction
of
providence
and
such
an
operation
of
the
supreme
being
as
that
which
determines
all
the
portions
of
matter
to
their
proper
centres
a
modern
philosopher
quoted
by
monsieur
in
his
learned
dissertation
on
the
souls
of
brutes
delivers
the
same
opinion
though
in
a
bolder
form
of
words
where
he
says
est
anima
god
himself
is
the
soul
of
brutes
who
can
tell
what
to
call
that
seeming
sagacity
in
animals
which
directs
them
to
such
food
as
is
proper
for
them
and
makes
them
naturally
avoid
whatever
is
noxious
or
unwholesome
has
observed
that
a
lamb
no
sooner
falls
from
its
mother
but
immediately
and
of
his
own
accord
applies
itself
to
the
teat
in
his
travels
tells
us
that
when
seamen
are
thrown
upon
any
unknown
coasts
of
america
they
never
venture
upon
the
fruit
of
any
tree
how
tempting
soever
it
may
appear
unless
they
observe
that
it
is
marked
with
the
pecking
of
birds
but
fall
on
without
any
fear
or
apprehension
where
the
birds
have
been
before
them
but
notwithstanding
animals
have
nothing
like
the
use
of
reason
we
find
in
them
all
the
lower
parts
of
our
nature
the
passions
and
senses
in
their
greatest
strength
and
perfection
and
here
it
is
worth
our
observation
that
all
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
are
wonderfully
subject
to
anger
malice
revenge
and
all
the
other
violent
passions
that
may
animate
them
in
search
of
their
proper
food
as
those
that
are
incapable
of
defending
themselves
or
annoying
others
or
whose
safety
lies
chiefly
in
their
flight
are
suspicious
fearful
and
apprehensive
of
every
thing
they
see
or
hear
whilst
others
that
are
of
assistance
and
use
to
man
have
their
natures
softened
with
something
mild
and
tractable
and
by
that
means
are
qualified
for
a
domestic
life
in
this
case
the
passions
generally
correspond
with
the
make
of
the
body
we
do
not
find
the
fury
of
the
lion
in
so
weak
and
defenceless
an
animal
as
a
lamb
nor
the
meekness
of
a
lamb
in
a
creature
so
armed
for
battle
and
assault
as
the
lion
in
the
same
manner
we
find
that
particular
animals
have
a
more
or
less
exquisite
sharpness
and
sagacity
in
those
particular
senses
which
most
turn
to
their
advantage
and
in
which
their
safety
and
welfare
is
the
most
concerned
nor
must
we
here
omit
that
great
variety
of
arms
with
which
nature
has
differently
fortified
the
bodies
of
several
kind
of
animals
such
as
claws
hoofs
and
horns
teeth
and
tusks
a
tail
a
sting
a
trunk
or
a
it
is
likewise
observed
by
naturalists
that
it
must
be
some
hidden
principle
distinct
from
what
we
call
reason
which
instructs
animals
in
the
use
of
these
their
arms
and
teaches
them
to
manage
them
to
the
best
advantage
because
they
naturally
defend
themselves
with
that
part
in
which
their
strength
lies
before
the
weapon
be
formed
in
it
as
is
remarkable
in
lambs
which
though
they
are
bred
within
doors
and
never
saw
the
action
of
their
own
species
push
at
those
who
approach
them
with
their
foreheads
before
the
first
budding
of
a
horn
appears
i
shall
add
to
these
general
observations
an
instance
which
has
given
us
of
providence
even
in
the
imperfections
of
a
creature
which
seems
the
meanest
and
most
despicable
in
the
whole
animal
world
says
he
the
make
of
an
oyster
or
cockle
conclude
that
it
has
not
so
many
nor
so
quick
senses
as
a
man
or
several
other
animals
nor
if
it
had
would
it
in
that
state
and
incapacity
of
transferring
itself
from
one
place
to
another
be
bettered
by
them
what
good
would
sight
and
hearing
do
to
a
creature
that
can
not
move
itself
to
or
from
the
object
wherein
at
a
distance
it
perceives
good
or
evil
and
would
not
quickness
of
sensation
be
an
inconvenience
to
an
animal
that
must
be
still
where
chance
has
once
placed
it
and
there
receive
the
afflux
of
colder
or
warmer
clean
or
foul
water
as
it
happens
to
come
to
i
shall
add
to
this
instance
out
of
another
out
of
the
learned
who
cites
it
from
in
relation
to
another
animal
which
providence
has
left
defective
but
at
the
same
time
has
shewn
its
wisdom
in
the
formation
of
that
organ
in
which
it
seems
chiefly
to
have
failed
is
more
obvious
and
ordinary
than
a
mole
and
yet
what
more
palpable
argument
of
providence
than
she
the
members
of
her
body
are
so
exactly
fitted
to
her
nature
and
manner
of
life
for
her
dwelling
being
under
ground
where
nothing
is
to
be
seen
nature
has
so
obscurely
fitted
her
with
eyes
that
naturalists
can
hardly
agree
whether
she
have
any
sight
at
all
or
no
but
for
amends
what
she
is
capable
of
for
her
defence
and
warning
of
danger
she
has
very
eminently
conferred
upon
her
for
she
is
exceedingly
quick
of
hearing
and
then
her
short
tail
and
short
legs
but
broad
forefeet
armed
with
sharp
claws
we
see
by
the
event
to
what
purpose
they
are
she
so
swiftly
working
herself
under
ground
and
making
her
way
so
fast
in
the
earth
as
they
that
behold
it
can
not
but
admire
it
her
legs
therefore
are
short
that
she
need
dig
no
more
than
will
serve
the
mere
thickness
of
her
body
and
her
fore
feet
are
broad
that
she
may
scoop
away
much
earth
at
a
time
and
little
or
no
tail
she
has
because
she
courses
it
not
on
the
ground
like
the
rat
and
mouse
of
whose
kindred
she
is
but
lives
under
the
earth
and
is
fain
to
dig
herself
a
dwelling
there
and
she
making
her
way
through
so
thick
an
element
which
will
not
yield
easily
as
the
air
or
the
water
it
had
been
dangerous
to
have
drawn
so
long
a
train
behind
her
for
her
enemy
might
fall
upon
her
rear
and
fetch
her
out
before
she
had
completed
or
got
full
possession
of
her
i
can
not
forbear
mentioning
remark
upon
this
last
creature
who
i
remember
somewhere
in
his
works
observes
that
though
the
mole
be
not
totally
blind
as
it
is
commonly
thought
she
has
not
sight
enough
to
distinguish
particular
objects
her
eye
is
said
to
have
but
one
humour
in
it
which
is
supposed
to
give
her
the
idea
of
light
but
of
nothing
else
and
is
so
formed
that
this
idea
is
probably
painful
to
the
animal
whenever
she
comes
up
into
broad
day
she
might
be
in
danger
of
being
taken
unless
she
were
thus
affected
by
a
light
striking
upon
her
eye
and
immediately
warning
her
to
bury
herself
in
her
proper
element
more
sight
would
be
useless
to
her
as
none
at
all
might
be
fatal
i
have
only
instanced
such
animals
as
seem
the
most
imperfect
works
of
nature
and
if
providence
shews
itself
even
in
the
blemishes
of
these
creatures
how
much
more
does
it
discover
itself
in
the
several
endowments
which
it
has
variously
bestowed
upon
such
creatures
as
are
more
or
less
finished
and
compleated
in
their
several
faculties
according
to
the
condition
of
life
in
which
they
are
posted
i
could
wish
our
royal
society
would
compile
a
body
of
natural
history
the
best
that
could
be
gathered
together
from
books
and
observations
if
the
several
writers
among
them
took
each
his
particular
species
and
gave
us
a
distinct
account
of
its
original
birth
and
education
its
policies
hostilities
and
alliances
with
the
frame
and
texture
of
its
inward
and
outward
parts
and
particularly
those
that
distinguish
it
from
all
other
animals
with
their
peculiar
aptitudes
for
the
state
of
being
in
which
providence
has
placed
them
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
services
their
studies
could
do
mankind
and
not
a
little
redound
to
the
glory
of
the
contriver
it
is
true
such
a
natural
history
after
all
the
disquisitions
of
the
learned
would
be
infinitely
short
and
defective
seas
and
deserts
hide
millions
of
animals
from
our
observation
innumerable
artifices
and
stratagems
are
acted
in
the
and
in
the
that
can
never
come
to
our
knowledge
besides
that
there
are
infinitely
more
species
of
creatures
which
are
not
to
be
seen
without
nor
indeed
with
the
help
of
the
finest
glasses
than
of
such
as
are
bulky
enough
for
the
naked
eye
to
take
hold
of
however
from
the
consideration
of
such
animals
as
lie
within
the
compass
of
our
knowledge
we
might
easily
form
a
conclusion
of
the
rest
that
the
same
variety
of
wisdom
and
goodness
runs
through
the
whole
creation
and
puts
every
creature
in
a
condition
to
provide
for
its
safety
and
subsistence
in
its
proper
station
has
given
us
an
admirable
sketch
of
natural
history
in
his
second
book
concerning
the
nature
of
the
gods
and
that
in
a
style
so
raised
by
metaphors
and
descriptions
that
it
lifts
the
subject
above
rallery
and
ridicule
which
frequently
fall
on
such
nice
observations
when
they
pass
through
the
hands
of
an
ordinary

by

opinion
of

that

my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
is
one
of
those
who
is
not
only
at
peace
within
himself
but
beloved
and
esteemed
by
all
about
him
he
receives
a
suitable
tribute
for
his
universal
benevolence
to
mankind
in
the
returns
of
affection
and
which
are
paid
him
by
every
one
that
lives
within
his
neighbourhood
i
lately
met
with
two
or
three
odd
instances
of
that
general
respect
which
is
shewn
to
the
good
old
knight
he
would
needs
carry
and
myself
with
him
to
the
county
assizes
as
we
were
upon
the
road
joined
a
couple
of
plain
men
who
rid
before
us
and
conversed
with
them
for
some
time
during
which
my
friend
sir
roger
acquainted
me
with
their
characters
the
first
of
them
says
he
that
has
a
spaniel
by
his
side
is
a
yeoman
of
about
an
hundred
pounds
a
year
an
honest
man
he
is
just
within
the
and
qualified
to
kill
an
hare
or
a
pheasant
he
knocks
down
a
dinner
with
his
gun
twice
or
thrice
and
by
that
means
lives
much
cheaper
than
those
who
have
not
so
good
an
estate
as
himself
he
would
be
a
good
neighbour
if
he
did
not
destroy
so
many
partridges
in
short
he
is
a
very
sensible
man
shoots
flying
and
has
been
several
times
foreman
of
the
the
other
that
rides
along
with
him
is
a
fellow
famous
for
the
of
every
body
there
is
not
one
in
the
town
where
he
lives
that
he
has
not
sued

the
rogue

once
the
impudence
to
go
to
law
with
the
his
head

full
of
costs
damages
and
ejectments
he
plagued
a
couple
of
honest
gentlemen
so
long
for
a
trespass
in
breaking
one
of
his
hedges
till
he
was
forced
to
sell
the
ground
it
inclosed
to
defray
the
charges
of
the
prosecution
his
father
left
him
fourscore
pounds
but
he
has
and
been
cast
so
often
that
he
is
not
now
worth
thirty
i
suppose
he
is
going
upon
the
old
business
of
the
as
sir
roger
was
giving
me
this
account
of
and
his
two
companions
stopped
short
till
we
came
up
to
them
after
having
paid
their
respects
to
sir
roger
told
him
that
and
he
must
appeal
to
him
upon
a
dispute
that
arose
between
them
it
seems
had
been
giving
his
an
account
of
his
angling
one
day
in
such
a
hole
when
instead
of
hearing
out
his
story
told
him
that
one
if
he
pleased
might
the
law
of
for
fishing
in
that
part
of
the
river
my
friend
sir
roger
heard
them
both
upon
a
round
trot
and
after
having
paused
some
time
told
them
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
would
not
give
his
judgment
rashly
that
might
be
said
on
both
they
were
neither
of
them
dissatisfied
with
the
determination
because
neither
of
them
found
himself
in
the
wrong
by
it
upon
which
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
assizes
the
court
was
sat
before
sir
roger
came
but
notwithstanding
all
the
justices
had
taken
their
places
upon
the
bench
they
made
room
for
the
old
knight
at
the
head
of
them
who
for
his
reputation
in
the
county
took
occasion
to
whisper
in
the
judge
ear
he
was
glad
his
lordship
had
met
with
so
much
good
weather
in
his
i
was
listening
to
the
proceeding
of
the
court
with
much
attention
and
infinitely
pleased
with
that
great
appearance
and
solemnity
which
so
properly
accompanies
such
a
publick
administration
of
our
laws
when
after
about
an
hour
sitting
i
observed
to
my
great
surprise
in
the
midst
of
a
trial
that
my
friend
sir
roger
was
getting
up
to
speak
i
was
in
some
pain
for
him
till
i
found
he
had
acquitted
himself
of
two
or
three
sentences
with
a
look
of
much
business
and
great
intrepidity
upon
his
first
rising
the
court
was
hushed
and
a
general
whisper
ran
among
the
country
people
that
sir
roger
the
speech
he
made
was
so
little
to
the
purpose
that
i
shall
not
trouble
my
readers
with
an
account
of
it
and
i
believe
was
not
so
much
designed
by
the
knight
himself
to
inform
the
court
as
to
give
him
a
figure
in
my
eye
and
keep
up
his
credit
in
the
country
i
was
highly
delighted
when
the
court
rose
to
see
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
gathering
about
my
old
friend
and
striving
who
should
compliment
him
most
at
the
same
time
that
the
ordinary
people
gazed
upon
him
at
a
distance
not
a
little
admiring
his
courage
that
was
not
afraid
to
speak
to
the
judge
in
our
return
home
we
met
with
a
very
odd
accident
which
i
can
not
forbear
relating
because
it
shews
how
desirous
all
who
know
sir
roger
are
of
giving
him
marks
of
their
esteem
when
we
were
arrived
upon
the
verge
of
his
estate
we
stopped
at
a
little
inn
to
rest
ourselves
and
our
horses
the
man
of
the
house
had
it
seems
been
formerly
a
servant
in
the
knight
family
and
to
do
honour
to
his
old
master
had
some
time
since
unknown
to
sir
roger
put
him
up
in
a
before
the
door
so
that
knight
had
hung
out
upon
the
road
about
a
week
before
he
himself
knew
any
thing
of
the
matter
as
soon
as
sir
roger
was
acquainted
with
it
finding
that
his
servant
indiscretion
proceeded
wholly
from
affection
and
he
only
told
him
that
he
had
made
him
too
high
a
compliment
and
when
the
fellow
seemed
to
think
that
could
hardly
be
added
with
a
more
decisive
look
that
it
was
too
great
an
honour
for
any
man
under
a
duke
but
told
him
at
the
same
time
that
it
might
be
altered
with
a
very
few
touches
and
that
he
himself
would
be
at
the
charge
of
it
accordingly
they
got
a
painter
by
the
directions
to
add
a
pair
of
whiskers
to
the
face
and
by
a
little
aggravation
of
the
features
to
change
it
into
the
i
should
not
have
known
this
story
had
not
the
innkeeper
upon
sir
roger
alighting
told
him
in
my
hearing
that
his
honour
head
was
brought
back
last
night
with
the
alterations
that
he
had
ordered
to
be
made
in
it
upon
this
my
friend
with
his
usual
cheerfulness
related
the
particulars
and
ordered
the
head
to
be
brought
into
the
room
i
could
not
forbear
discovering
greater
expressions
of
mirth
than
ordinary
upon
the
appearance
of
this
monstrous
face
under
which
notwithstanding
it
was
made
to
frown
and
stare
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
i
could
still
discover
a
distant
resemblance
of
my
old
friend
sir
roger
upon
seeing
me
laugh
desired
me
to
tell
him
truly
if
i
thought
it
possible
for
people
to
know
him
in
that
disguise
i
at
first
kept
my
usual
silence
but
upon
the
knight
conjuring
me
to
tell
him
whether
it
was
not
still
more
like
himself
than
a
i
composed
my
countenance
in
the
best
manner
i
could
and
replied
much
might
be
said
on
both
these
several
adventures
with
the
knight
behaviour
in
them
gave
me
as
pleasant
a

taking

with
my

we
were
met
by
a
ruddy
young
man
who
rid
by
us
full
speed
with
a
couple
of
servants
behind
him
upon
my
inquiry
who
he
was
sir
roger
told
me
that
he
was
a
young
gentleman
of
a
considerable
estate
who
had
been
educated
by
a
tender
mother
that
lived
not
many
miles
from
the
place
where
we
were
she
is
a
very
good
lady
says
my
friend
but
took
so
much
care
of
her
son
health
that
she
has
made
him
good
for
nothing
she
quickly
found
that
reading
was
bad
for
his
eyes
and
that
writing
made
his
head
ache
he
was
let
loose
among
the
woods
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
ride
on
horseback
or
carry
a
gun
upon
his
shoulder
to
be
brief
i
found
by
my
friend
account
of
him
that
he
had
got
a
great
stock
of
health
but
nothing
else
and
that
if
it
were
a
business
only
to
live
there
would
not
be
a
more
accomplished
young
fellow
in
the
whole
country
the
truth
of
it
is
since
my
residing
in
these
parts
i
have
seen
and
heard
innumerable
instances
of
young
heirs
and
elder
brothers
who
either
from
their
own
reflecting
upon
the
estates
they
are
born
to
and
therefore
thinking
all
other
accomplishments
unnecessary
or
from
hearing
these
notions
frequently
inculcated
to
them
by
the
flattery
of
their
servants
and
domesticks
or
from
the
same
foolish
thought
prevailing
in
those
who
have
the
care
of
their
education
are
of
no
manner
of
use
but
to
keep
up
their
families
and
transmit
their
lands
and
houses
in
a
line
to
posterity
this
makes
me
often
think
on
a
story
i
have
heard
of
two
friends
which
i
shall
give
my
reader
at
large
under
feigned
names
the
moral
of
it
may
i
hope
be
useful
though
there
are
some
circumstances
which
make
it
rather
appear
like
a
novel
than
a
true
story
and
began
the
world
with
small
estates
they
were
both
of
them
men
of
good
sense
and
great
virtue
they
prosecuted
their
studies
together
in
their
earliest
years
and
entered
into
such
a
friendship
as
lasted
to
the
end
of
their
lives
at
his
first
setting
out
in
the
world
threw
himself
into
a
court
where
by
his
natural
endowments
and
his
acquired
abilities
he
made
his
way
from
one
post
to
another
till
at
length
he
had
raised
a
very
considerable
fortune
on
the
contrary
sought
all
opportunities
of
improving
his
mind
by
study
conversation
and
travel
he
was
not
only
acquainted
with
all
the
sciences
but
with
the
most
eminent
professors
of
them
throughout
he
knew
perfectly
well
the
interests
of
its
princes
with
the
customs
and
fashions
of
their
courts
and
could
scarce
meet
with
the
name
of
an
extraordinary
person
in
the
whom
he
had
not
either
talked
to
or
seen
in
short
he
had
so
well
mixed
and
digested
his
knowledge
of
men
and
books
that
he
made
one
of
the
most
accomplished
persons
of
his
age
during
the
whole
course
of
his
studies
and
travels
he
kept
up
a
punctual
correspondence
with
who
often
made
himself
acceptable
to
the
principal
men
about
court
by
the
intelligence
which
he
received
from
when
they
were
both
turned
of
forty
an
age
in
which
according
to
there
is
no
dallying
with
they
determined
pursuant
to
the
resolution
they
had
taken
in
the
beginning
of
their
lives
to
retire
and
pass
the
remainder
of
their
days
in
the
country
in
order
to
this
they
both
of
them
married
much
about
the
same
time
with
his
own
and
his
fortune
bought
a
farm
of
three
hundred
which
lay
within
the
neighbourhood
of
his
friend
who
had
purchased
an
estate
of
as
many
thousands
they
were
both
of
them
fathers
about
the
same
time
having
a
son
born
to
him
and
a
daughter
but
to
the
unspeakable
grief
of
the
latter
his
young
wife
in
whom
all
his
happiness
was
wrapt
up
died
in
a
few
days
after
the
birth
of
her
daughter
his
affliction
would
have
been
insupportable
had
he
not
been
comforted
by
the
daily
visits
and
conversations
of
his
friend
as
they
were
one
day
talking
together
with
their
usual
intimacy
considering
how
incapable
he
was
of
giving
his
daughter
a
proper
education
in
his
own
house
and
reflecting
on
the
ordinary
behaviour
of
a
son
who
knows
himself
to
be
the
heir
of
a
great
estate
they
both
agreed
upon
an
exchange
of
children
namely
that
the
boy
should
be
bred
up
with
as
his
son
and
that
the
girl
should
live
with
as
his
daughter
till
they
were
each
of
them
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
the
wife
of
knowing
that
her
son
could
not
be
so
advantageously
brought
up
as
under
the
care
of
and
considering
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
be
perpetually
under
her
own
eye
was
by
degrees
prevailed
upon
to
fall
in
with
the
project
she
therefore
took
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
girl
and
educated
her
as
her
own
daughter
the
two
friends
on
each
side
had
wrought
themselves
to
such
an
habitual
tenderness
for
the
children
who
were
under
their
direction
that
each
of
them
had
the
real
passion
of
a
father
where
the
title
was
but
imaginary
the
name
of
the
young
heir
that
lived
with
though
he
had
all
the
duty
and
affection
imaginable
for
his
supposed
parent
was
taught
to
rejoice
at
the
sight
of
who
visited
his
friend
very
frequently
and
was
dictated
by
his
natural
affection
as
well
as
by
the
rules
of
prudence
to
make
himself
esteemed
and
beloved
by
the
boy
was
now
old
enough
to
know
his
supposed
father
circumstances
and
that
therefore
he
was
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
by
his
own
industry
this
consideration
grew
stronger
in
him
every
day
and
produced
so
good
an
effect
that
he
applied
himself
with
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
the
pursuit
of
every
thing
which
recommended
to
him
his
natural
abilities
which
were
very
good
assisted
by
the
directions
of
so
excellent
a
counsellor
enabled
him
to
make
a
quicker
progress
than
ordinary
through
all
the
parts
of
his
education
before
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
having
finished
his
studies
and
exercises
with
great
applause
he
was
removed
from
the
university
to
the
inns
of
court
where
there
are
very
few
that
make
themselves
considerable
proficients
in
the
studies
of
the
place
who
know
they
shall
arrive
at
great
estates
without
them
this
was
not
case
he
found
that
three
hundred
was
but
a
poor
estate
for
and
himself
to
live
upon
so
that
he
studied
without
intermission
till
he
gained
a
very
good
insight
into
the
constitution
and
laws
of
his
country
i
should
have
told
my
reader
that
whilst
lived
at
the
house
of
his
he
was
always
an
acceptable
guest
in
the
family
of
where
he
became
acquainted
with
from
her
infancy
his
acquaintance
with
her
by
degrees
grew
into
love
which
in
a
mind
trained
up
in
all
the
sentiments
of
honour
and
virtue
became
a
very
uneasy
passion
he
despaired
of
gaining
an
heiress
of
so
great
a
fortune
and
would
rather
have
died
than
attempted
it
by
any
indirect
methods
who
was
a
woman
of
the
greatest
beauty
joined
with
the
greatest
modesty
entertained
at
the
same
time
a
secret
passion
for
but
conducted
herself
with
so
much
prudence
that
she
never
gave
him
the
least
intimation
of
it
was
now
engaged
in
all
those
arts
and
improvements
that
are
proper
to
raise
a
man
private
fortune
and
give
him
a
figure
in
his
country
but
secretly
tormented
with
that
passion
which
burns
with
the
greatest
fury
in
a
virtuous
and
noble
heart
when
he
received
a
sudden
summons
from
to
repair
to
him
in
the
country
the
next
day
for
it
seems
was
so
filled
with
the
report
of
his
son
reputation
that
he
could
no
longer
making
himself
known
to
him
the
morning
after
his
arrival
at
the
house
of
his
supposed
father
told
him
that
had
something
of
great
importance
to
communicate
to
him
upon
which
the
good
man
embraced
him
and
wept
was
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
great
house
that
stood
in
his
neighbourhood
but
took
him
by
the
hand
after
the
first
salutes
were
over
and
conducted
him
into
his
closet
he
there
opened
to
him
the
whole
secret
of
his
parentage
and
education
concluding
after
this
manner
have
no
other
way
left
of
acknowledging
my
gratitude

marrying
you

misplaced

been
so
exemplary
that
it
deserves
the
greatest
reward
i
can
confer
upon
it
you
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
great
estate
fall
to
you
which
you
would
have
lost
the
relish
of
had
you
known
yourself
born

it

to
deserve
it

manner
you

so
overwhelmed
with
this
profusion
of
happiness
that
he
was
not
able
to
make
a
reply
but
threw
himself
down
at
his
father
feet
and
amidst
a
flood
of
tears
kissed
and
embraced
his
knees
asking
his
blessing
and
expressing
in
dumb
show
those
sentiments
of
love
duty
and
gratitude
that
were
too
big

my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
when
we
are
talking
of
the
malice
of
parties
very
frequently
tells
us
an
accident
that
happened
to
him
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
which
was
at
a
time
when
the
feuds
ran
high
between
the
and
cavaliers
this
worthy
knight
being
then
but
a
stripling
had
occasion
to
inquire
which
was
the
way
to
lane
upon
which
the
person
whom
he
spoke
to
instead
of
answering
his
question
called
him
a
young
popish
cur
and
asked
him
who
had
made
a
saint
the
boy
being
in
some
confusion
inquired
of
the
next
he
met
which
was
the
way
to
lane
but
was
called
a
prickeared
cur
for
his
pains
and
instead
of
being
shown
the
way
was
told
that
she
had
been
a
saint
before
he
was
born
and
would
be
one
after
he
was
hanged
upon
this
says
sir
roger
i
did
not
think
fit
to
repeat
the
former
question
but
going
into
every
lane
of
the
neighbourhood
asked
what
they
called
the
name
of
that
lane
by
which
ingenious
artifice
he
found
out
the
place
he
inquired
after
without
giving
offence
to
any
party
sir
roger
generally
closes
this
narrative
with
reflections
on
the
mischief
that
parties
do
in
the
country
how
they
spoil
good
neighbourhood
and
make
honest
gentlemen
hate
one
another
besides
that
they
manifestly
tend
to
the
prejudice
of
the
tax
and
the
destruction
of
the
game
there
can
not
a
greater
judgment
befal
a
country
than
such
a
dreadful
spirit
of
division
as
rends
a
government
into
two
distinct
people
and
makes
them
greater
strangers
and
more
averse
to
one
another
than
if
they
were
actually
two
different
nations
the
effects
of
such
a
division
are
pernicious
to
the
last
degree
not
only
with
regard
to
those
advantages
which
they
give
the
common
enemy
but
to
those
private
evils
which
they
produce
in
the
heart
of
almost
every
particular
person
this
influence
is
very
fatal
both
to
men
morals
and
their
understandings
it
sinks
the
virtue
of
a
nation
and
not
only
so
but
destroys
even
common
sense
a
furious
when
it
rages
in
its
full
violence
exerts
itself
in
civil
war
and
bloodshed
and
when
it
is
under
its
greatest
restraints
naturally
breaks
out
in
falsehood
detraction
calumny
and
a
partial
administration
of
justice
in
a
word
it
fills
a
nation
with
spleen
and
rancour
and
extinguishes
all
the
seeds
of
compassion
and
humanity
says
very
finely
that
a
man
should
not
allow
himself
to
hate
even
his
enemies
because
says
he
if
you
indulge
this
passion
in
some
occasions
it
will
rise
of
itself
in
others
if
you
hate
your
enemies
you
will
contract
such
a
vicious
habit
of
mind
as
by
degrees
will
break
out
upon
those
who
are
your
friends
or
those
who
are
indifferent
to
you
i
might
here
observe
how
admirably
this
precept
of
morality
which
derives
the
malignity
of
hatred
from
the
passion
itself
and
not
from
its
object
answers
to
that
great
rule
which
was
dictated
to
the
world
about
an
hundred
years
before
this
philosopher
wrote
but
instead
of
that
i
shall
only
take
notice
with
a
real
grief
of
heart
that
the
minds
of
many
good
men
among
us
appear
soured
with
principles
and
alienated
from
one
another
in
such
a
manner
as
seems
to
me
altogether
inconsistent
with
the
dictates
either
of
reason
or
religion
zeal
for
a
publick
cause
is
apt
to
breed
passions
in
the
hearts
of
virtuous
persons
to
which
the
regard
of
their
own
private
interest
would
never
have
betrayed
them
if
this
has
so
ill
an
effect
on
our
morals
it
has
likewise
a
very
great
one
upon
our
judgments
we
often
hear
a
poor
insipid
paper
or
pamphlet
cried
up
and
sometimes
a
noble
piece
depreciated
by
those
who
are
of
a
different
principle
from
the
author
one
who
is
actuated
by
this
spirit
is
almost
under
an
incapacity
of
discerning
either
real
blemishes
or
beauties
a
man
of
merit
in
a
different
principle
is
like
an
object
seen
in
two
different
mediums
that
appears
crooked
or
broken
however
straight
and
entire
it
may
be
in
itself
for
this
reason
there
is
scarce
a
person
of
any
figure
in
who
does
not
go
by
two
contrary
characters
as
opposite
to
one
another
as
light
and
darkness
knowledge
and
learning
suffer
in
a
particular
manner
from
this
strange
prejudice
which
at
present
prevails
amongst
all
ranks
and
degrees
in
the
nation
as
men
formerly
became
eminent
in
learned
societies
by
their
parts
and
acquisitions
they
now
distinguish
themselves
by
the
warmth
and
violence
with
which
they
espouse
their
respective
parties
books
are
valued
upon
the
like
considerations
an
abusive
scurrilous
style
passes
for
satire
and
a
dull
scheme
of
notions
is
called
fine
writing
there
is
one
piece
of
sophistry
practised
by
both
sides
and
that
is
the
taking
any
scandalous
story
that
has
been
ever
whispered
or
invented
of
a
private
man
for
a
known
undoubted
truth
and
raising
suitable
speculations
upon
it
calumnies
that
have
been
never
proved
or
have
been
often
refuted
are
the
ordinary
postulatums
of
these
infamous
scribblers
upon
which
they
proceed
as
upon
first
principles
granted
by
all
men
though
in
their
hearts
they
know
they
are
false
or
at
best
very
doubtful
when
they
have
laid
these
foundations
of
scurrility
it
is
no
wonder
that
their
superstructure
is
every
way
answerable
to
them
if
this
shameless
practice
of
the
present
age
endures
much
longer
praise
and
reproach
will
cease
to
be
motives
of
action
in
good
men
there
are
certain
periods
of
time
in
all
governments
when
this
inhuman
spirit
prevails
was
long
torn
in
pieces
by
the
and
and
by
those
who
were
for
and
against
the
league
but
it
is
very
unhappy
for
a
man
to
be
born
in
such
a
stormy
and
tempestuous
season
it
is
the
restless
ambition
of
artful
men
that
thus
breaks
a
people
into
factions
and
draws
several
persons
to
their
interest
by
a
specious
concern
for
their
country
how
many
honest
minds
are
filled
with
uncharitable
and
barbarous
notions
out
of
their
zeal
for
the
publick
good
what
cruelties
and
outrages
would
they
not
commit
against
men
of
an
adverse
party
whom
they
would
honour
and
esteem
if
instead
of
considering
them
as
they
are
represented
they
knew
them
as
they
are
thus
are
persons
of
the
greatest
probity
seduced
into
shameful
errors
and
prejudices
and
made
bad
men
even
by
that
noblest
of
principles
the
love
of
their
country
i
can
not
here
forbear
mentioning
the
famous
proverb
there
were
neither
fools
nor
knaves
in
the
world
all
people
would
be
of
one
for
my
own
part
i
could
heartily
wish
that
all
honest
men
would
enter
into
an
association
for
the
support
of
one
another
against
the
endeavours
of
those
whom
they
ought
to
look
upon
as
their
common
enemies
whatsoever
side
they
may
belong
to
were
there
such
an
honest
body
of
neutral
forces
we
should
never
see
the
worst
of
men
in
great
figures
of
life
because
they
are
useful
to
a
party
nor
the
best
unregarded
because
they
are
above
practising
those
methods
which
would
be
grateful
to
their
faction
we
should
then
single
every
criminal
out
of
the
herd
and
hunt
him
down
however
formidable
and
overgrown
he
might
appear
on
the
contrary
we
should
shelter
distressed
innocence
and
defend
virtue
however
beset
with
contempt
or
ridicule
envy
or
defamation
in
short
we
should
not
any
longer
regard
our
subjects
as
whigs
or
tories
but
should
make
the
man
of
merit
our
friend
and
the
villain
our
enemy

are
the
same
to
me
dryden
in
my
yesterday
paper
i
proposed
that
the
honest
men
of
all
parties
should
enter
into
a
kind
of
association
for
the
defence
of
one
another
and
the
confusion
of
their
common
enemies
as
it
is
designed
this
neutral
body
should
act
with
a
regard
to
nothing
but
truth
and
equity
and
divest
themselves
of
the
little
heats
and
prepossessions
that
cleave
to
parties
of
all
kinds
i
have
prepared
for
them
the
following
form
of
an
association
which
may
express
their
intentions
in
the
most
plain
and
simple
manner
whose
names
are
hereunto
subscribed
do
solemnly
declare
that
we
do
in
our
consciences
believe
two
and
two
make
four
and
that
we
shall
adjudge
any
man
whatsoever
to
be
our
enemy
who
endeavours
to
persuade
us
to
the
contrary
we
are
likewise
ready
to
maintain
with
the
hazard
of
all
that
is
near
and
dear
to
us
that
six
is
less
than
seven
in
all
times
and
all
places
and
that
ten
will
not
be
more
three
years
hence
than
it
is
at
present
we
do
also
firmly
declare
that
it
is
our
resolution
as
long
as
we
live
to
call
black
black
and
white
white
and
we
shall
upon
all
occasions
oppose
such
persons
that
upon
any
day
of
the
year
shall
call
black
white
or
white
black
with
the
utmost
peril
of
our
lives
and
were
there
such
a
combination
of
honest
men
who
without
any
regard
to
places
would
endeavour
to
extirpate
all
such
furious
zealots
as
would
sacrifice
one
half
of
their
country
to
the
passion
and
interest
of
the
other
as
also
such
infamous
hypocrites
that
are
for
promoting
their
own
advantage
under
colour
of
the
publick
good
with
all
the
profligate
immoral
retainers
to
each
side
that
have
nothing
to
recommend
them
but
an
implicit
submission
to
their
leaders
we
should
soon
see
that
furious
extinguished
which
may
in
time
expose
us
to
the
derision
and
contempt
of
all
the
nations
about
us
a
member
of
this
society
that
would
thus
carefully
employ
himself
in
making
room
for
merit
by
throwing
down
the
worthless
and
depraved
part
of
mankind
from
those
conspicuous
stations
of
life
to
which
they
have
been
sometimes
advanced
and
all
this
without
any
regard
to
his
private
interest
would
be
no
small
benefactor
to
his
country
i
remember
to
have
read
in
an
account
of
a
very
active
little
animal
which
i
think
he
calls
the
that
makes
it
the
whole
business
of
his
life
to
break
the
eggs
of
the
crocodile
which
he
is
always
in
search
after
this
instinct
is
the
more
remarkable
because
the
never
feeds
upon
the
eggs
he
has
broken
nor
any
other
way
finds
his
account
in
them
were
it
not
for
the
incessant
labours
of
this
industrious
animal
says
the
historian
would
be
with
crocodiles
for
the
are
so
far
from
destroying
those
pernicious
creatures
that
they
worship
them
as
gods
if
we
look
into
the
behaviour
of
ordinary
partizans
we
shall
find
them
far
from
resembling
this
disinterested
animal
and
rather
acting
after
the
example
of
the
wild
who
are
ambitious
of
destroying
a
man
of
the
most
extraordinary
parts
and
accomplishments
as
thinking
upon
his
decease
the
same
talents
whatever
post
they
qualified
him
for
enter
of
course
into
his
destroyer
as
in
the
whole
train
of
my
speculations
i
have
endeavoured
as
much
as
i
am
able
to
extinguish
that
pernicious
spirit
of
passion
and
prejudice
which
rages
with
the
same
violence
in
all
parties
i
am
still
the
more
desirous
of
doing
some
good
in
this
particular
because
i
observe
that
the
spirit
of
party
reigns
more
in
the
country
than
in
the
town
it
here
contracts
a
kind
of
brutality
and
rustick
fierceness
to
which
men
of
politer
conversation
are
wholly
strangers
it
extends
itself
even
to
the
return
of
the
bow
and
the
hat
and
at
the
same
time
that
the
heads
of
parties
preserve
towards
one
another
an
outward
show
of
and
keep
up
a
perpetual
intercourse
of
civilities
their
tools
that
are
dispersed
in
these
outlying
parts
will
not
so
much
as
mingle
together
at
a
this
humour
fills
the
country
with
several
periodical
meetings
of
whig
jockeys
and
tory
not
to
mention
the
innumerable
curses
frowns
and
whispers
it
produces
at
a
sessions
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
observed
in
any
of
my
former
papers
that
my
friends
sir
roger
de
coverley
and
sir
andrew
freeport
are
of
different
principles
the
first
of
them
inclined
to
the
and
the
other
to
the
interest
this
humour
is
so
moderate
in
each
of
them
that
it
proceeds
no
farther
than
to
an
agreeable
rallery
which
very
often
diverts
the
rest
of
the
club
i
find
however
that
the
knight
is
a
much
stronger
tory
in
the
country
than
in
town
which
as
he
has
told
me
in
my
ear
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
keeping
up
his
interest
in
all
our
journey
from
to
his
house
we
did
not
so
much
as
bait
at
a
whig
inn
or
if
by
chance
the
coachman
stopped
at
a
wrong
place
one
of
sir
roger
servants
would
ride
up
to
his
master
full
speed
and
whisper
to
him
that
the
master
of
the
house
was
against
such
an
one
in
the
last
election
this
often
betrayed
us
into
hard
beds
and
bad
cheer
for
we
were
not
so
inquisitive
about
the
inn
as
the
and
provided
our
landlord
principles
were
sound
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
staleness
of
his
provisions
this
i
found
still
the
more
inconvenient
because
the
better
the
host
was
the
worse
generally
were
his
accommodations
the
fellow
knowing
very
well
that
those
who
were
his
friends
would
take
up
with
coarse
diet
and
an
hard
lodging
for
these
reasons
all
the
while
i
was
upon
the
road
i
dreaded
entering
into
an
house
of
any
one
that
sir
roger
had
applauded
for
an
honest
man
since
my
stay
at
sir
roger
in
the
country
i
daily
find
more
instances
of
this
narrow
being
upon
a
at
a
neighbouring
the
other
day
for
that
is
the
place
where
the
gentlemen
of
one
side
meet
once
a
week
i
observed
a
stranger
among
them
of
a
better
presence
and
genteeler
behaviour
than
ordinary
but
was
much
surprised
that
notwithstanding
he
was
a
very
fair
no
body
would
take
him
up
but
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
he
was
one
who
had
given
a
disagreeable
vote
in
a
former
parliament
for
which
reason
there
was
not
a
man
upon
that
who
would
have
so
much
correspondence
with
him
as
to
win
his
money
of
him
among
other
instances
of
this
nature
i
must
not
omit
one
which
concerns
myself
was
the
other
day
relating
several
strange
stories
that
he
had
picked
up
no
body
knows
where
of
a
certain
great
man
and
upon
my
staring
at
him
as
one
that
was
surprised
to
hear
such
things
in
the
country
which
had
never
been
so
much
as
whispered
in
the
town
stopped
short
in
the
thread
of
his
discourse
and
after
dinner
asked
my
friend
sir
roger
in
his
ear
if
he
was
sure
that
i
was
not
a
fanatick
it
gives
me
a
serious
concern
to
see
such
a
spirit
of
dissension
in
the
country
not
only
as
it
destroys
virtue
and
common
sense
and
renders
us
in
a
manner
barbarians
towards
one
another
but
as
it
perpetuates
our
animosities
widens
our
breaches
and
transmits
our
present
passions
and
prejudices
to
our
posterity
for
my
own
part
i
am
sometimes
afraid
that
i
discover
the
seeds
of
a
civil
war
in
these
our
divisions
and
therefore
can
not
but
bewail
as
in
their
first
principles
the
miseries
and
calamities
of
our
children

been
very
saucy

that

keep
us

certain
that

after

a
variety
of
and
lines
of
circumvallation
a
female
who
is
thus
invested

sufficiently
secured
against
the
approaches
of
an

might
as
well
think
of

way
of
making
love
in

as
in

many

these
various
conjectures
there
are
men
of

look
upon

some
will
have
it
that
it
portends
the
downfal
of

and
observe
that

appeared
in
a
little
before

are
of
opinion
that
it
fortels

believe
it

prognostication

themselves
already
very
much
straitened

if
the

increase

wish
it
may
not
drive
many
ordinary
women
into
meetings

conventicles
should
our
sex
at
the

take
it
into
their
heads
to
wear
as
who

what
their
indignation
at
this
female
treatment
may
drive
them
to
a
man

his
wife
would
fill
a
whole
pew
know
sir
it
is
recorded
of
the
that
in
his
expedition
he
buried
several
suits
of
armour
which
by
his
direction
were
made
much
too
big
for
any
of
his
soldiers
in
order
to
give
posterity
an
extraordinary
idea
of
him
and
make
them
believe
he
had
commanded
an
army
of
giants
i
am
persuaded
that
if
one
of
the
present
petticoats
happens
to
be
hung
up
in
any
repository
of
curiosities
it
will
lead
into
the
same
error
the
generations
that
lie
some
removes
from
us
unless
we
can
believe
our
posterity
will
think
so
disrespectfully
of
their
that
they
made
themselves
monstrous
to
appear
amiable
i
survey
this
in
all
its
parts
i
can
not
but
think
of
the
old
philosopher
who
after
having
entered
into
an
temple
and
looked
about
for
the
idol
of
the
place
at
length
discovered
a
little
black
monkey
enshrined
in
the
midst
of
it
upon
which
he
could
not
forbear
crying
out
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
worshippers
what
a
magnificent
palace
is
here
for
such
a
ridiculous
inhabitant
you
have
taken
a
resolution
in
one
of
your
papers
to
avoid
descending
to
particularities
of
dress
i
believe
you
will
not
think
it
below
you
on
so
extraordinary
an
occasion
to
unhoop
the
fair
sex
and
cure
this
fashionable
tympany
that
is
got
among
them
i
am
apt
to
think
the
petticoat
will
shrink
of
its
own
accord
at
your
first
coming
to
town
at
least
a
touch
of
your
pen
will
make
it
contract
itself
like
the
sensitive
plant
and
by
that
means
oblige
several
who
are
either
terrified
or
astonished
at
this
portentous
novelty

women
in

men
whether
it
be
that
their
blood
is
more
refined
their
fibres
more
delicate
and
their
animal
spirits
more
light
and
volatile
or
whether
as
some
have
imagined
there
may
not
be
a
kind
of
sex
in
the
very
soul
i
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
as
vivacity
is
the
gift
of
women
gravity
is
that
of
men
they
should
each
of
them
therefore
keep
a
watch
upon
the
particular
bias
which
nature
has
fixed
in
their
mind
that
it
may
not
too
much
and
lead
them
out
of
the
paths

this
will
certainly
happen

the
one
in
every
word
and
action
affects
the
character
of
being
rigid

severe

the
other

being
brisk

beware
of

degenerates
into

the

grows
sullen

fantastical
by
what
i
have
said
we
may
conclude
men

women
were
made
as
counterparts
to
one
another
that
the
pains
and
anxieties
of

might
be
relieved

the
sprightliness

of
the

these
are
rightly

chearfulness

natural
historians
observe
for
whilst
i
am
in
the
country
i
must
fetch
my
allusions
from
thence
that
only
the
male
birds
have
voices
that
their
songs
begin
a
little
before
and
end
a
little
after
that
whilst
the
hen
is
covering
her
eggs
the
male
generally
takes
his
stand
upon
a
neighbouring
bough
within
her
hearing
and
by
that
means
amuses
and
diverts
her
with
his
songs
during
the
whole
time
of
her
sitting
this
contract
among
birds
lasts
no
longer
than
till
a
brood
of
young
ones
arises
from
it
so
that
in
the
feathered
kind
the
cares
and
fatigues
of
the
married
state
if
i
may
so
call
it
lie
principally
upon
the
female
on
the
contrary
as
in
our
species
the
man
and
woman
are
joined
together
for
life
and
the
main
burden
rests
upon
the
former
nature
has
given
all
the
little
arts
of
soothing
and
blandishment
to
the
female
that
she
may
chear
and
animate
her
companion
in
a
constant
and
assiduous
application
to
the
making
a
provision
for
his
family
and
the
educating
of
their
common
children
this
however
is
not
to
be
taken
so
strictly
as
if
the
same
duties
were
not
often
reciprocal
and
incumbent
on
both
parties
but
only
to
set
forth
what
seems
to
have
been
the
general
intention
of
nature
in
the
different
inclinations
and
endowments
which
are
bestowed
on
the
different
sexes
but
whatever
was
the
reason
that
man
and
woman
were
made
with
this
variety
of
temper
if
we
observe
the
conduct
of
the
fair
sex
we
find
that
they
choose
rather
to
associate
themselves
with
a
person
who
resembles
them
in
that
light
and
volatile
humour
which
is
natural
to
them
than
to
such
as
are
qualified
to
moderate
and
counterbalance
it
it
has
been
an
old
complaint
that
the
coxcomb
carries
it
with
them
before
the
man
of
sense
when
we
see
a
fellow
loud
and
talkative
full
of
insipid
life
and
laughter
we
may
venture
to
pronounce
him
a
female
favourite
noise
and
flutter
are
such
accomplishments
as
they
can
not
withstand
to
be
short
the
passion
of
an
ordinary
woman
for
a
man
is
nothing
else
but
diverted
upon
another
object
she
would
have
the
lover
a
woman
in
every
thing
but
the
sex
i
do
not
know
a
finer
piece
of
satire
on
this
part
of
womankind
than
those
lines
of
thoughtless
sex
is
caught
by
outward
form
and
empty
noise
and
loves
itself
in
this
is
a
source
of
infinite
calamities
to
the
sex
as
it
frequently
joins
them
to
men
who
in
their
own
thoughts
are
as
fine
creatures
as
themselves
or
if
they
chance
to
be
serve
only
to
dissipate
their
fortunes
inflame
their
follies
and
aggravate
their
indiscretions
the
same
female
levity
is
no
less
fatal
to
them
after
marriage
than
before
it
represents
to
their
imaginations
the
faithful
prudent
husband
as
an
honest
tractable
and
domestick
animal
and
turns
their
thoughts
upon
the
fine
gay
gentleman
that
laughs
sings
and
dresses
so
much
more
agreeably
as
this
irregular
vivacity
of
temper
leads
astray
the
hearts
of
ordinary
women
in
the
choice
of
their
lovers
and
the
treatment
of
their
husbands
it
operates
with
the
same
pernicious
influence
towards
their
children
who
are
taught
to
accomplish
themselves
in
all
those
sublime
perfections
that
appear
captivating
in
the
eye
of
their
mother
she
admires
in
her
son
what
she
loved
in
her
gallant
and
by
that
means
contributes
all
she
can
to
perpetuate
herself
in
a
worthless
progeny
the
younger
was
a
lively
instance
of
this
sort
of
women
notwithstanding
she
was
married
to
one
of
the
greatest
wisest
and
best
of
the
emperors
she
thought
a
common
gladiator
much
the
prettier
gentleman
and
had
taken
such
care
to
accomplish
her
son
according
to
her
own
notions
of
a
fine
man
that
when
he
ascended
the
throne
of
his
father
he
became
the
most
foolish
and
abandoned
tyrant
that
was
jo
ever
placed
at
the
head
of
the
signalizing
himself
in
nothing
but
the
fighting
of
prizes
and
knocking
out
men
brains
as
he
had
no
taste
of
true
glory
we
see
him
in
several
medals
and
statues
which
are
still
extant
of
him
equipped
like
an
with
a
club
and
a
lion
skin
i
have
been
led
into
this
speculation
by
the
characters
i
have
heard
of
a
country
gentleman
and
his
lady
who
do
not
live
many
miles
from
sir
roger
the
wife
is
an
old
coquette
that
is
always
hankering
after
the
diversions
of
the
town
the
husband
a
morose
rustick
that
frowns
and
frets
at
the
name
of
it
the
wife
is
with
affectation
the
husband
sunk
into
brutality
the
lady
can
not
bear
the
noise
of
the
larks
and
nightingales
hates
your
tedious
summer
days
and
is
sick
at
the
sight
of
shady
woods
and
purling
streams
the
husband
wonders
how
any
one
can
be
pleased
with
the
fooleries
of
plays
and
operas
and
rails
from
morning
to
night
at
essenced
fops
and
tawdry
courtiers
the
children
are
educated
in
these
different
notions
of
their
parents
the
sons
follow
the
father
about
his
grounds
while
the
daughters
read
volumes
of
and
romances
to
their
mother
by
this
means
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
girls
look
upon
their
father
as
a
clown
and
the
boys
think
their
mother
no
better
than
she
should
be
how
different
are
the
lives
of
and
the
innocent
vivacity
of
the
one
is
tempered
and
composed
by
the
chearful
gravity
of
the
other
the
wife
grows
wise
by
the
discourses
of
the
husband
and
the
husband
by
the
conversations
of
the
wife
would
not
be
so
amiable
were
it
not
for
his
nor
so
much
esteemed
were
it
not
for
her
their
virtues
are
blended
in
their
children
and
diffuse
through
the
whole
family
a
perpetual
spirit
of
benevolence
complacency
and
satisfaction

to

who

who
walks

finds
as
great
a
variety
of
garbs
and
habits
in
the
persons
he
converses

did
they
keep
to
one
constant
dress
they
would
sometimes
be
in
the
fashion
which
they
never

are

instead
of
running

therefore
i

advise

who
was
hunting
about
the
whole

after
a
rambling
fellow
if
you
follow

if
you
plant
yourself
at

corner
of

street
i
engage
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
see
him
i
have
already
touched
upon
this
subject
in
a
speculation
which
shows
how
cruelly
the
country
are
led
astray
in
following
the
town
and
equipped
in
a
ridiculous
habit
when
they
fancy
themselves
in
the
height
of
the
mode
since
that
speculation
i
have
received
a
letter
which
i
there
hinted
at
from
a
gentleman
who
is
now
in
the
western
circuit
spectator
a
lawyer
of
the
a
by
birth
i
generally
ride
the
western
circuit
for
my
health
and
as
i
am
not
interrupted
with
clients
have
leisure
to
make
many
observations
that
escape
the
notice
of
my
of
the
most
fashionable
women
i
met
with
in
all
the
circuit
was
my
landlady
at
where
i
chanced
to
be
on
a
holiday
her
commode
was
not
half
a
foot
high
and
her
petticoat
within
some
yards
of
a
modish
circumference
in
the
same
place
i
observed
a
young
fellow
with
a
tolerable
periwig
had
it
not
been
covered
with
a
hat
that
was
shaped
in
the
cock
as
i
proceeded
in
my
journey
i
observed
the
petticoat
grew
scantier
and
scantier
and
about
threescore
miles
from
was
so
very
unfashionable
that
a
woman
might
walk
in
it
without
any
manner
of
inconvenience
far
from
i
took
notice
of
a
justice
of
lady
who
was
at
least
ten
years
behindhand
in
her
dress
but
at
the
same
time
as
fine
as
hands
could
make
her
she
was
flounced
and
furbelowed
from
head
to
foot
every
ribbon
was
wrinkled
and
every
part
of
her
garments
in
curl
so
that
she
looked
like
one
of
those
animals
which
in
the
country
we
call
a
hen
many
miles
beyond
this
place
i
was
informed
that
one
of
the
last
year
little
muffs
had
by
some
means
or
other
straggled
into
those
parts
and
that
all
the
women
of
fashion
were
cutting
their
old
muffs
in
two
or
retrenching
them
according
to
the
little
model
which
was
got
among
them
i
can
not
believe
the
report
they
have
there
that
it
was
sent
down
franked
by
a
in
a
little
packet
but
probably
by
next
winter
this
fashion
will
be
at
the
height
in
the
country
when
it
is
quite
out
at
the
greatest
beau
at
our
next
was
dressed
in
a
most
monstrous
flaxen
periwig
that
was
made
in
king
reign
the
wearer
of
it
goes
it
seems
in
his
own
hair
when
he
is
at
home
and
lets
his
wig
lie
in
buckle
for
a
whole
half
year
that
he
may
put
it
on
upon
occasion
to
meet
the
judges
in
it
must
not
here
omit
an
adventure
which
happened
to
us
in
a
country
church
upon
the
frontiers
of
as
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
service
a
lady
who
is
the
chief
woman
of
the
place
and
had
passed
the
winter
at
with
her
husband
entered
the
congregation
in
a
little
and
a
hooped
petticoat
the
people
who
were
wonderfully
startled
at
such
a
sight
all
of
them
rose
up
some
stared
at
the
prodigious
bottom
and
some
at
the
little
top
of
this
strange
dress
in
the
mean
time
the
lady
of
the
manor
filled
the
area
of
the
church
and
walked
up
to
her
pew
with
an
unspeakable
satisfaction
amidst
the
whispers
conjectures
and
astonishments
of
the
whole
congregation
our
way
from
hence
we
saw
a
young
fellow
riding
towards
us
full
gallop
with
a
and
a
black
silken
bag
tied
to
it
he
stopt
short
at
the
coach
to
ask
us
how
far
the
judges
were
behind
us
his
stay
was
so
very
short
that
we
had
only
time
to
observe
his
new
silk
waistcoat
which
was
unbuttoned
in
several
places
to
let
us
see
that
he
had
a
clean
shirt
on
which
was
ruffled
down
to
his
middle
this
place
during
our
progress
through
the
most
western
parts
of
the
kingdom
we
fancied
ourselves
in
in
king
ii
reign
the
people
having
made
very
little
variations
in
their
dress
since
that
time
the
smartest
of
the
country
squires
appear
still
in
the
cock
and
when
they
go
a
wooing
whether
they
have
any
post
in
the
militia
or
not
they
generally
put
on
a
red
coat
we
were
indeed
very
much
surprised
at
the
place
we
lay
at
last
night
to
meet
with
a
gentleman
that
had
accoutred
himself
in
a
wig
a
coat
with
long
pockets
and
slit
sleeves
and
a
pair
of
shoes
with
high
scollop
tops
but
we
soon
found
by
his
conversation
that
he
was
a
person
who
laughed
at
the
ignorance
and
rusticity
of
the
country
people
and
was
resolved
to
live
and
die
in
the
mode
if
you
think
this
account
of
my
travels
may
be
of
any
advantage
to
the
public
i
will
next
year
trouble
you
with
such
occurrences
as
i
shall
meet
with
in
other
parts
of
for
i
am
informed
there
are
greater
curiosities
in
the
northern
circuit
than
in
the
western
and
that
a
fashion
makes
its
progress
much
slower
into
than
into
i
have
heard
in
particular
that
the
steenkirk
arrived
but
two
months
ago
at
and
that
there
are
several
commodes
in

are

hunting
their

and
was
their
trade
dryden
as
i
was
yesterday
riding
out
in
the
fields
with
my
friend
sir
roger
we
saw
at
a
little
distance
from
us
a
troop
of
gipsies
upon
the
first
discovery
of
them
my
friend
was
in
some
doubt
whether
he
should
not
exert
the
of
the
upon
such
a
band
of
lawless
vagrants
but
not
having
his
clerk
with
him
who
is
a
necessary
counsellor
on
these
occasions
and
fearing
that
his
poultry
might
fare
the
worse
for
it
he
let
the
thought
drop
but
at
the
same
time
gave
me
a
particular
account
of
the
mischiefs
they
do
in
the
country
in
stealing
people
goods
and
spoiling
their
servants
if
a
stray
piece
of
linen
hangs
upon
an
hedge
says
sir
roger
they
are
sure
to
have
it
if
the
hog
loses
his
way
in
the
fields
it
is
ten
to
one
but
he
becomes
their
prey
our
geese
can
not
live
in
peace
for
them
if
a
man
prosecutes
them
with
severity
his
henroost
is
sure
to
pay
for
it
they
generally
straggle
into
these
parts
about
this
time
of
the
year
and
set
the
heads
of
our
so
agog
for
husbands
that
we
do
not
expect
to
have
any
business
done
as
it
should
be
whilst
they
are
in
the
country
i
have
an
honest
dairymaid
who
crosses
their
hands
with
a
piece
of
silver
every
summer
and
never
fails
being
promised
the
handsomest
young
fellow
in
the
parish
for
her
pains
your
friend
the
butler
has
been
fool
enough
to
be
seduced
by
them
and
though
he
is
sure
to
lose
a
knife
a
fork
or
a
spoon
every
time
his
fortune
is
told
him
generally
shuts
himself
up
in
the
pantry
with
an
old
gipsy
for
above
half
an
hour
once
in
a
twelvemonth
sweethearts
are
the
things
they
live
upon
which
they
bestow
very
plentifully
upon
all
those
that
apply
themselves
to
them
you
see
now
and
then
some
handsome
young
jades
among
them
the
sluts
have
very
often
white
teeth
and
black
eyes
sir
roger
observing
that
i
listened
with
great
attention
to
his
account
of
a
people
who
were
so
entirely
new
to
me
told
me
that
if
i
would
they
should
tell
us
our
fortunes
as
i
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
knight
proposal
we
rid
up
and
communicated
our
hands
to
them
a
of
the
crew
after
having
examined
my
lines
very
diligently
told
me
that
i
loved
a
pretty
maid
in
a
corner
that
i
was
a
good
woman
man
with
some
other
particulars
which
i
do
not
think
proper
to
relate
my
friend
sir
roger
alighted
from
his
horse
and
exposing
his
palm
to
two
or
three
that
stood
by
him
they
crumpled
it
into
all
shapes
and
diligently
scanned
every
wrinkle
that
could
be
made
in
it
when
one
of
them
who
was
older
and
more
sunburnt
than
the
rest
told
him
that
he
had
a
widow
in
his
line
of
life
upon
which
the
knight
cried
go
go
you
are
an
idle
baggage
and
at
the
same
time
smiled
upon
me
the
gipsy
finding
he
was
not
displeased
in
his
heart
told
him
after
a
farther
inquiry
into
his
hand
that
his
was
constant
and
that
she
should
dream
of
him
my
old
friend
cried
pish
and
bid
her
go
on
the
gipsy
told
him
that
he
was
a
bachelor
but
would
not
be
so
long
and
that
he
was
dearer
to
somebody
than
he
thought
the
knight
still
repeated
she
was
an
idle
baggage
and
bid
her
go
on
ah
master
says
the
gipsy
that
roguish
leer
of
yours
makes
a
pretty
woman
heart
ache
you
have
not
that
simper
about
the
mouth
for
nothing
the
uncouth
gibberish
with
which
all
this
was
uttered
like
the
darkness
of
an
oracle
made
us
the
more
attentive
to
it
to
be
short
the
knight
left
the
money
with
her
that
he
had
crossed
her
hand
with
and
got
up
again
on
his
horse
as
we
were
riding
away
sir
roger
told
me
that
he
knew
several
sensible
people
who
believed
these
gipsies
now
and
then
foretold
very
strange
things
and
for
half
an
hour
together
appeared
more
jocund
than
ordinary
in
the
height
of
his
meeting
a
common
beggar
upon
the
road
who
was
no
conjurer
as
he
went
to
relieve
him
he
found
his
pocket
was
picked
that
being
a
kind
of
palmistry
at
which
this
race
of
vermin
are
very
dexterous
i
might
here
entertain
my
reader
with
historical
remarks
on
this
idle
profligate
people
who
infest
all
the
countries
of
and
live
in
the
midst
of
governments
in
a
kind
of
commonwealth
by
themselves
but
instead
of
entering
into
observations
of
this
nature
i
shall
fill
the
remaining
part
of
my
paper
with
a
story
which
is
still
fresh
in
and
was
printed
in
one
of
our
monthly
accounts
about
twenty
years
ago
the
or
which
carries
passengers
from
to
was
putting
off
a
boy
running
along
the
side
of
the
canal
desired
to
be
taken
in
which
the
master
of
the
boat
refused
because
the
lad
had
not
quite
money
enough
to
pay
the
usual
fare
an
eminent
merchant
being
pleased
with
the
looks
of
the
boy
and
secretly
touched
with
compassion
towards
him
paid
the
money
for
him
and
ordered
him
to
be
taken
on
board
upon
talking
with
him
afterwards
he
found
that
he
could
speak
readily
in
three
or
four
languages
and
learned
upon
further
examination
that
he
had
been
stolen
away
when
he
was
a
child
by
a
gipsy
and
had
rambled
ever
since
with
a
gang
of
those
strollers
up
and
down
several
parts
of
it
happened
that
the
merchant
whose
heart
seems
to
have
inclined
towards
the
boy
by
a
secret
kind
of
instinct
had
himself
lost
a
child
some
years
before
the
parents
after
a
long
search
for
him
gave
him
for
drowned
in
one
of
the
canals
with
which
that
country
abounds
and
the
mother
was
so
afflicted
at
the
loss
of
a
fine
boy
who
was
her
only
son
that
she
died
for
grief
of
it
upon
laying
together
all
particulars
and
examining
the
several
moles
and
marks
by
which
the
mother
used
to
describe
the
child
when
he
was
first
missing
the
boy
proved
to
be
the
son
of
the
merchant
whose
heart
had
so
unaccountably
melted
at
the
sight
of
him
the
lad
was
very
well
pleased
to
find
a
father
who
was
so
rich
and
likely
to
leave
him
a
good
estate
the
father
on
the
other
hand
was
not
a
little
delighted
to
see
a
son
return
to
him
whom
he
had
given
for
lost
with
such
a
strength
of
constitution
sharpness
of
understanding
and
skill
in
languages
here
the
printed
story
leaves
off
but
if
i
may
give
credit
to
reports
our
linguist
having
received
such
extraordinary
rudiments
towards
a
good
education
was
afterwards
trained
up
in
every
thing
that
becomes
a
gentleman
wearing
off
by
little
and
little
all
the
vicious
habits
and
practices
that
he
had
been
used
to
in
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
nay
it
is
said
that
he
has
since
been
employed
in
foreign
courts
upon
national
business
with
great
reputation
to
himself
and
honour
to
those
who
sent
him
and
that
he
has
visited
several
countries
as
a
public
minister
in
which
he
formerly
wandered
as
a
gipsy

it
is
usual
for
a
man
who
loves
to
preserve
the
game
on
his
own
grounds
and
divert
himself
upon
those
that
belong
to
his
neighbour
my
friend
sir
roger
generally
goes
two
or
three
miles
from
his
house
and
gets
into
the
frontiers
of
his
estate
before
he
beats
about
in
search
of
a
hare
or
partridge
on
purpose
to
spare
his
own
fields
where
he
is
always
sure
of
finding
to
diversion
when
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
by
this
means
the
breed
about
his
house
has
time
to
increase
and
multiply
beside
that
the
sport
is
the
more
agreeable
where
the
game
is
the
harder
to
come
at
and
where
it
does
not
lie
so
thick
as
to
produce
any
perplexity
or
confusion
in
the
pursuit
for
these
reasons
the
country
gentleman
like
the
fox
seldom
preys
near
his
own
home
in
the
same
manner
i
have
made
a
month
excursion
out
of
the
town
which
is
the
great
field
of
game
for
sportsmen
of
my
species
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
country
where
i
have
started
several
subjects
and
hunted
them
down
with
some
pleasure
to
myself
and
i
hope
to
others
i
am
here
forced
to
use
a
great
deal
of
diligence
before
i
can
spring
anything
to
my
mind
whereas
in
town
whilst
i
am
following
one
character
it
is
ten
to
one
but
i
am
crossed
in
my
way
by
another
and
put
up
such
a
variety
of
odd
creatures
in
both
sexes
that
they
foil
the
scent
of
one
another
and
puzzle
the
chace
my
greatest
difficulty
in
the
country
is
to
find
sport
and
in
town
to
chuse
it
in
the
mean
time
as
i
have
given
a
whole
month
rest
to
the
cities
of
and
i
promise
myself
abundance
of
new
game
upon
my
return
thither
it
is
indeed
high
time
for
me
to
leave
the
country
since
i
find
the
whole
neighbourhood
begin
to
grow
very
inquisitive
after
my
name
and
character
my
love
of
solitude
taciturnity
and
particular
way
of
life
having
raised
a
great
curiosity
in
all
these
parts
the
notions
which
have
been
framed
of
me
are
various
some
look
upon
me
as
very
proud
some
as
very
modest
and
some
as
very
melancholy
as
my
friend
the
butler
tells
me
observing
me
very
much
alone
and
extremely
silent
when
i
am
in
company
is
afraid
i
have
killed
a
man
the
country
people
seem
to
suspect
me
for
a
conjurer
and
some
of
them
hearing
of
the
visit
which
i
made
to
will
needs
have
it
that
sir
roger
has
brought
down
a
cunning
man
with
him
to
cure
the
old
woman
and
free
the
country
from
her
charms
so
that
the
character
which
i
go
under
in
part
of
the
neighbourhood
is
what
they
here
call
a
a
justice
of
peace
who
lives
about
five
miles
off
and
is
not
of
sir
roger
party
has
it
seems
said
twice
or
thrice
at
his
table
that
he
wishes
sir
roger
does
not
harbour
a
jesuit
in
his
house
and
that
he
thinks
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
would
do
very
well
to
make
me
give
some
account
of
myself
on
the
other
side
some
of
sir
roger
friends
are
afraid
the
old
knight
is
imposed
upon
by
a
designing
fellow
and
as
they
have
heard
that
he
converses
very
promiscuously
when
he
is
in
town
do
not
know
but
he
has
brought
down
with
him
some
discarded
whig
that
is
sullen
and
says
nothing
because
he
is
out
of
place
such
is
the
variety
of
opinions
which
are
here
entertained
of
me
so
that
i
pass
among
some
for
a
disaffected
person
and
among
others
for
a
popish
priest
among
some
for
a
wizard
and
among
others
for
a
murderer
and
all
this
for
no
other
reason
that
i
can
imagine
but
because
i
do
not
hoot
and
hollow
and
make
a
noise
it
is
true
my
friend
sir
roger
tells
them
it
is
my
and
that
i
am
only
a
philosopher
but
this
will
not
satisfy
them
they
think
there
is
more
in
me
than
he
discovers
and
that
i
do
not
hold
my
tongue
for
nothing
for
these
and
other
reasons
i
shall
set
out
for
having
found
by
experience
that
the
country
is
not
a
place
for
a
person
of
my
temper
who
does
not
love
jollity
and
what
they
call
good
neighbourhood
a
man
that
is
out
of
humour
when
an
unexpected
guest
breaks
in
upon
him
and
does
not
care
for
sacrificing
an
afternoon
to
every
that
will
be
the
master
of
his
own
time
and
the
pursuer
of
his
own
inclinations
makes
but
a
very
unsociable
figure
in
this
kind
of
life
i
shall
therefore
retire
into
the
town
if
i
may
make
use
of
that
phrase
and
get
into
the
crowd
again
as
fast
as
i
can
in
order
to
be
alone
i
can
there
raise
what
speculations
i
please
upon
others
without
being
observed
myself
and
at
the
same
time
enjoy
all
the
advantages
of
company
with
all
the
privileges
of
solitude
in
the
mean
while
to
finish
the
month
and
conclude
these
my
rural
speculations
i
shall
here
insert
a
letter
from
my
friend
will
honeycomb
who
has
not
lived
a
month
for
these
forty
years
out
of
the
smoke

london

rallies

his
way

that
i

next
day
his
horses
were
ready
at
the
appointed
hour
in
the
evening
and
attended
by
one
of
his
grooms
i
arrived
at
the
country
town
at
twilight
in
order
to
be
ready
for
the
the
day
following
as
soon
as
we
arrived
at
the
inn
the
servant
who
waited
upon
me
inquired
of
the
chamberlain
in
my
hearing
what
company
he
had
for
the
coach
the
fellow
answered
the
great
fortune
and
the
widow
her
mother
a
recruiting
officer
who
took
a
place
because
they
were
to
go
young
squire
her
cousin
that
her
mother
wished
her
to
be
married
to
the
quaker
her
guardian
and
a
gentleman
that
had
studied
himself
dumb
from
sir
roger
de
coverley
i
observed
by
what
he
said
of
myself
that
according
to
his
office
he
dealt
much
in
intelligence
and
doubted
not
but
there
was
some
foundation
for
his
reports
for
the
rest
of
the
company
as
well
as
for
the
whimsical
account
he
gave
of
me
the
next
morning
at
we
were
all
called
and
i
who
know
my
own
natural
shyness
and
endeavour
to
be
as
little
liable
to
be
disputed
with
as
possible
dressed
immediately
that
i
might
make
no
one
wait
the
first
preparation
for
our
setting
out
was
that
the
captain
was
placed
near
the
coachman
and
a
drum
behind
the
coach
in
the
mean
time
the
drummer
the
captain
equipage
was
very
loud
that
none
of
the
captain
things
should
be
placed
so
as
to
be
spoiled
upon
which
his
was
fixed
in
the
seat
of
the
coach
and
the
captain
himself
according
to
a
frequent
though
invidious
behaviour
of
military
men
ordered
his
man
to
look
sharp
that
none
but
one
of
the
ladies
should
have
the
place
he
had
taken
fronting
to
the
we
were
in
some
little
time
fixed
in
our
seats
and
sat
with
that
dislike
which
people
not
too
usually
conceive
of
each
other
at
first
sight
the
coach
jumbled
us
insensibly
into
some
sort
of
familiarity
and
we
had
not
moved
above
two
miles
when
the
widow
asked
the
captain
what
success
he
had
in
his
recruiting
the
officer
with
a
frankness
he
believed
very
graceful
told
her
indeed
he
had
but
very
little
luck
and
had
suffered
much
by
desertion
therefore
should
be
glad
to
end
his
warfare
in
the
service
of
her
or
her
fair
daughter
in
a
word
continued
he
i
am
a
soldier
and
to
be
plain
is
my
character
you
see
me
madam
young
sound
and
impudent
take
me
yourself
widow
or
give
me
to
her
i
will
be
wholly
at
your
disposal
i
am
a
soldier
of
fortune
ha
this
was
followed
by
a
vain
laugh
of
his
own
and
a
deep
silence
of
all
the
rest
of
the
company
i
had
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
fall
fast
asleep
which
i
did
with
all
speed
said
he
upon
it
we
will
make
a
wedding
at
the
next
town
we
will
wake
this
pleasant
companion
who
is
fallen
asleep
to
be
the
brideman
and
giving
the
quaker
a
clap
on
the
knee
he
concluded
sly
saint
who
i
warrant
understands
what
what
as
well
as
you
or
i
widow
shall
give
the
bride
as
father
the
quaker
who
happened
to
be
a
man
of
smartness
answered
i
take
it
in
good
part
that
thou
hast
given
me
the
authority
of
a
father
over
this
comely
and
virtuous
child
and
i
must
assure
thee
that
if
i
have
the
giving
her
i
shall
not
bestow
her
on
thee
thy
mirth
friend
savoureth
of
folly
thou
art
a
person
of
a
light
mind
thy
drum
is
a
type
of
thee
it
soundeth
because
it
is
empty
verily
it
is
not
from
thy
fullness
but
thy
emptiness
that
thou
hast
spoken
this
day
friend
friend
we
have
hired
this
coach
in
partnership
with
thee
to
carry
us
to
the
great
city
we
can
not
go
any
other
way
this
worthy
mother
must
hear
thee
if
thou
wilt
needs
utter
thy
follies
we
can
not
help
it
friend
i
say
if
thou
wilt
we
must
hear
thee
but
if
thou
wert
a
man
of
understanding
thou
wouldst
not
take
advantage
of
thy
courageous
countenance
to
abash
us
children
of
peace
thou
art
thou
sayest
a
soldier
give
quarter
to
us
who
can
not
resist
thee
why
didst
thou
fleer
at
our
friend
who
feigned
himself
asleep
he
said
nothing
but
how
dost
thou
know
what
he
containeth
if
thou
speakest
improper
things
in
the
hearing
of
this
virtuous
young
virgin
consider
it
as
an
outrage
against
a
distressed
person
that
can
not
get
from
thee
to
speak
indiscreetly
what
we
are
obliged
to
hear
by
being
hasped
up
with
thee
in
this
public
vehicle
is
in
some
degree
assaulting
on
the
high
road
here
paused
and
the
captain
with
a
happy
and
uncommon
impudence
which
can
be
convicted
and
support
itself
at
the
same
time
cries
friend
i
thank
thee
i
should
have
been
a
little
impertinent
if
thou
hadst
not
reprimanded
me
come
thou
art
i
see
a
smoky
old
fellow
and
i
be
very
orderly
the
ensuing
part
of
my
journey
i
was
going
to
give
myself
airs
but
ladies
i
beg
pardon
the
captain
was
so
little
out
of
humour
and
our
company
was
so
far
from
being
soured
by
this
little
ruffle
that
and
he
took
a
particular
delight
in
being
agreeable
to
each
other
for
the
future
and
assumed
their
different
provinces
in
the
conduct
of
the
company
our
reckonings
apartments
and
accommodation
fell
under
and
the
captain
looked
to
all
disputes
upon
the
road
as
the
good
behaviour
of
our
coachman
and
the
right
we
had
of
taking
place
as
going
to
of
all
vehicles
coming
from
thence
the
occurrences
we
met
with
were
ordinary
and
very
little
happened
which
could
entertain
by
the
relation
of
them
but
when
i
considered
the
company
we
were
in
i
took
it
for
no
small
that
the
whole
journey
was
not
spent
in
impertinencies
which
to
the
one
part
of
us
might
be
an
entertainment
to
the
other
a
suffering
what
therefore
said
when
we
were
almost
arrived
at
had
to
me
an
air
not
only
of
good
understanding
but
good
breeding
upon
the
young
expressing
her
satisfaction
in
the
journey
and
declaring
how
delightful
it
had
been
to
her
delivered
himself
as
follows
is
no
ordinary
part
of
human
life
which
expresseth
so
much
a
good
mind
and
a
right
inward
man
as
his
behaviour
upon
meeting
with
strangers
especially
such
as
may
seem
the
most
unsuitable
companions
to
him
such
a
man
when
he
falleth
in
the
way
with
persons
of
simplicity
and
innocence
however
knowing
he
may
be
in
the
ways
of
men
will
not
vaunt
himself
thereof
but
will
the
rather
hide
his
superiority
to
them
that
he
may
not
be
painful
unto
them
my
good
friend
continued
he
turning
to
the
officer
thee
and
i
are
to
part
by
and
by
and
peradventure
we
may
never
meet
again
but
be
advised
by
a
plain
man
modes
and
apparel
are
but
trifles
to
the
real
man
therefore
do
not
think
such
a
man
as
thyself
terrible
for
thy
garb
nor
such
a
one
as
me
contemptible
for
mine
when
two
such
as
thee
and
i
meet
with
affections
such
as
we
ought
to
have
towards
each
other
thou
shouldst
rejoice
to
see
my
peaceable
demeanour
and
i
should
be
glad
to
see
thy
strength
and
ability
to
protect
me

dryden
i
was
this
morning
surprised
with
a
great
knocking
at
the
door
when
my
landlady
daughter
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
there
was
a
man
below
desired
to
speak
with
me
upon
my
asking
her
who
it
was
she
told
me
it
was
a
very
grave
elderly
person
but
that
she
did
not
know
his
name
i
immediately
went
down
to
him
and
found
him
to
be
the
coachman
of
my
worthy
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
he
told
me
that
his
master
came
to
town
last
night
and
would
be
glad
to
take
a
turn
with
me
in
walks
as
i
was
wondering
in
myself
what
had
brought
sir
roger
to
town
not
having
lately
received
any
letter
from
him
he
told
me
that
his
master
was
come
up
to
get
a
sight
of
prince
and
that
he
desired
i
would
immediately
meet
him
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
curiosity
of
the
old
knight
though
i
did
not
much
wonder
at
it
having
heard
him
say
more
than
once
in
private
discourse
that
he
looked
upon
prince
for
so
the
knight
always
calls
him
to
be
a
greater
man
than
i
was
no
sooner
come
into
walks
but
i
heard
my
friend
upon
the
terrace
hemming
twice
or
thrice
to
himself
with
great
vigour
for
he
loves
to
clear
his
pipes
in
good
air
to
make
use
of
his
own
phrase
and
is
not
a
little
pleased
with
any
one
who
takes
notice
of
the
strength
which
he
still
exerts
in
his
morning
hems
i
was
touched
with
a
secret
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
good
old
man
who
before
he
saw
me
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
beggar
man
that
had
asked
an
alms
of
him
i
could
hear
my
friend
chide
him
for
not
finding
out
some
work
but
at
the
same
time
saw
him
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
give
him
sixpence
our
salutations
were
very
hearty
on
both
sides
consisting
of
many
kind
shakes
of
the
hand
and
several
affectionate
looks
which
we
cast
upon
one
another
after
which
the
knight
told
me
my
good
friend
his
chaplain
was
very
well
and
much
at
my
service
and
that
the
before
he
had
made
a
most
incomparable
sermon
out
of
have
left
says
he
my
affairs
in
his
hands
and
being
willing
to
lay
an
obligation
upon
him
have
deposited
with
him
thirty
merks
to
be
distributed
among
his
poor
parishioners
he
then
proceeded
to
acquaint
me
with
the
welfare
of
upon
which
he
put
his
hand
into
his
fob
and
presented
me
in
his
name
with
a
telling
me
that
had
been
busy
all
the
beginning
of
the
winter
in
turning
great
quantities
of
them
and
that
he
made
a
present
of
one
to
every
gentleman
in
the
country
who
has
good
principles
and
smokes
he
added
that
poor
was
at
present
under
great
tribulation
for
that
had
taken
the
law
of
him
for
cutting
some
out
of
one
of
his
hedges
among
other
pieces
of
news
which
the
knight
brought
from
his
seat
he
informed
me
that
was
dead
and
that
about
a
month
after
her
death
the
wind
was
so
very
high
that
it
blew
down
the
end
of
one
of
his
barns
for
my
own
part
says
sir
roger
do
not
think
that
the
old
woman
had
any
hand
in
it
he
afterwards
fell
into
an
account
of
the
diversions
which
had
passed
in
his
house
during
the
holidays
for
sir
roger
after
the
laudable
custom
of
his
ancestors
always
keeps
open
house
at
i
learned
from
him
that
he
had
killed
eight
fat
hogs
for
this
season
that
he
had
dealt
about
his
chines
very
liberally
amongst
his
neighbours
and
that
in
particular
he
had
sent
a
string
of
with
a
pack
of
cards
to
every
poor
family
in
the
parish
have
often
thought
says
sir
roger
happens
very
well
that
should
fall
out
in
the
middle
of
winter
it
is
the
most
dead
uncomfortable
time
of
the
year
when
the
poor
people
would
suffer
very
much
from
their
poverty
and
cold
if
they
had
not
good
cheer
warm
fires
and
gambols
to
support
them
i
love
to
rejoice
their
poor
hearts
at
this
season
and
to
see
the
whole
village
merry
in
my
great
hall
i
allow
a
double
quantity
of
malt
to
my
small
beer
and
set
it
a
running
for
twelve
days
to
every
one
that
calls
for
it
i
have
always
a
piece
of
cold
beef
and
a
upon
the
table
and
am
wonderfully
pleased
to
see
my
tenants
pass
away
a
whole
evening
in
playing
their
innocent
tricks
and
smutting
one
another
our
friend
is
as
merry
as
any
of
them
and
shews
a
thousand
roguish
tricks
upon
these
occasions
i
was
very
much
delighted
with
the
reflexion
of
my
old
friend
which
carried
so
much
goodness
in
it
he
then
launched
out
into
the
praise
of
the
late
act
of
parliament
for
securing
the
church
of
and
told
me
with
great
satisfaction
that
he
believed
it
already
began
to
take
effect
for
that
a
rigid
dissenter
who
chanced
to
dine
at
his
house
on
day
had
been
observed
to
eat
very
plentifully
of
his
after
having
dispatched
all
our
country
matters
sir
roger
made
several
inquiries
concerning
the
club
and
particularly
of
his
old
antagonist
sir
andrew
freeport
he
asked
me
with
a
kind
of
a
smile
whether
sir
andrew
had
not
taken
the
advantage
of
his
absence
to
vent
among
them
some
of
his
republican
doctrines
but
soon
after
gathering
up
his
countenance
into
a
more
than
ordinary
seriousness
me
truly
says
he
not
you
think
sir
andrew
had
a
hand
in
the
pope
procession
but
without
giving
me
time
to
answer
him
well
says
he
know
you
are
a
wary
man
and
do
not
care
to
talk
of
public
matters
the
knight
then
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
prince
eugenio
and
made
me
promise
to
get
him
a
stand
in
some
convenient
place
where
he
might
have
a
full
sight
of
that
extraordinary
man
whose
presence
does
so
much
honour
to
the
nation
he
dwelt
very
long
on
the
praises
of
this
great
general
and
i
found
that
since
i
was
with
him
in
the
country
he
had
drawn
many
just
observations
together
out
of
his
reading
in
chronicle
and
other
authors
who
always
lie
in
his
hall
window
which
very
much
redound
to
the
honour
of
this
prince
having
passed
away
the
greatest
part
of
the
morning
in
hearing
the
knight
reflexions
which
were
partly
private
and
partly
political
he
asked
me
if
i
would
smoke
a
pipe
with
him
over
a
dish
of
coffee
at
as
i
love
the
old
man
i
take
delight
in
complying
with
every
thing
that
is
agreeable
to
him
and
accordingly
waited
on
him
to
the
where
his
venerable
figure
drew
upon
us
the
eyes
of
the
whole
room
he
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
at
the
upper
end
of
the
high
table
but
he
called
for
a
clean
pipe
a
paper
of
tobacco
a
dish
of
coffee
a
and
the
with
such
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
that
all
the
boys
in
the
who
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
serving
him
were
at
once
employed
on
his
several
errands
insomuch
that
no
body
else
could
come
at
a
dish
of
tea
until
the
knight
had
got
all
his
conveniences
about
him

with
and

of
we
must
descend
into
the
silent
tomb
my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
told
me
the
other
night
that
he
had
been
reading
my
paper
upon
which
says
he
are
a
great
many
ingenious
fancies
he
told
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
observed
i
had
promised
another
paper
upon
and
that
he
should
be
glad
to
go
and
see
them
with
me
not
having
visited
them
since
he
had
read
history
i
could
not
at
first
imagine
how
this
came
into
the
knight
head
till
i
recollected
that
he
had
been
very
busy
all
last
summer
upon
chronicle
which
he
has
quoted
several
times
in
his
disputes
with
sir
andrew
freeport
since
his
last
coming
to
town
accordingly
i
promised
to
call
upon
him
the
next
morning
that
we
might
go
together
to
the
i
found
the
knight
under
his
butler
hands
who
always
shaves
him
he
was
no
sooner
dressed
than
he
called
for
a
glass
of
the
widow
water
which
they
told
me
he
always
drank
before
he
went
abroad
he
recommended
to
me
a
dram
of
it
at
the
same
time
with
so
much
heartiness
that
i
could
not
forbear
drinking
it
as
soon
as
i
had
got
it
down
i
found
it
very
unpalatable
upon
which
the
knight
observing
that
i
had
made
several
wry
faces
told
me
that
he
knew
i
should
not
like
it
at
first
but
that
it
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
against
the
stone
or
gravel
i
could
have
wished
indeed
that
he
had
acquainted
me
with
the
virtues
of
it
sooner
but
it
was
too
late
to
complain
and
i
knew
what
he
had
done
was
out
of
sir
roger
told
me
further
that
he
looked
upon
it
to
be
very
good
for
a
man
whilst
he
staid
in
town
to
keep
off
infection
and
that
he
got
together
a
quantity
of
it
upon
the
first
news
of
the
sickness
being
at
when
of
a
sudden
turning
short
to
one
of
his
servants
who
stood
behind
him
he
bid
him
call
a
and
take
care
it
was
an
elderly
man
that
drove
it
he
then
resumed
his
discourse
upon
water
telling
me
that
the
widow
was
one
who
did
more
good
than
all
the
doctors
or
apothecaries
in
the
country
that
she
distilled
every
poppy
that
grew
within
five
miles
of
her
that
she
distributed
her
water
among
all
sorts
of
people
to
which
the
knight
added
that
she
had
a
very
great
jointure
and
that
the
whole
country
would
fain
have
it
a
match
between
him
and
her
truly
says
sir
roger
i
had
not
been
engaged
perhaps
i
could
not
have
done
better
his
discourse
was
broken
off
by
his
man
telling
him
he
had
called
a
coach
upon
our
going
to
it
after
having
cast
his
eye
upon
the
wheels
he
asked
the
coachman
if
his
was
good
upon
the
telling
him
he
would
warrant
it
the
knight
turned
to
me
told
me
he
looked
like
an
honest
man
and
went
in
without
further
ceremony
we
had
not
gone
far
when
sir
roger
popping
out
his
head
called
the
coachman
down
from
his
box
and
upon
presenting
himself
at
the
window
asked
him
if
he
smoked
as
i
was
considering
what
this
would
end
in
he
bid
him
stop
by
the
way
at
any
good
tobacconist
and
take
in
a
roll
of
their
best
nothing
material
happened
in
the
remaining
part
of
our
journey
till
we
were
set
down
at
the
west
end
of
the
as
we
went
up
the
body
of
the
church
the
knight
pointed
at
the
trophies
upon
one
of
the
new
monuments
and
cried
out
brave
man
i
warrant
him
passing
afterwards
by
sir
he
flung
his
hand
that
way
and
cried
a
very
gallant
man
as
he
stood
before
tomb
the
knight
uttered
himself
again
after
the
same
manner
a
great
man
he
whipped
my
grandfather
a
very
great
man
i
should
have
gone
to
him
myself
if
i
had
not
been
a
blockhead
a
very
great
man
we
were
immediately
conducted
to
the
little
chapel
on
the
right
hand
sir
roger
planting
himself
at
our
historian
elbow
was
very
attentive
to
every
thing
he
said
particularly
to
the
account
he
gave
us
of
the
lord
who
had
cut
off
the
king
of
head
among
several
other
figures
he
was
very
well
pleased
to
see
the
statesman
upon
his
knees
and
concluding
them
all
to
be
great
men
was
conducted
to
the
figure
which
represents
that
martyr
to
good
housewifery
who
died
by
the
prick
of
a
needle
upon
our
telling
us
that
she
was
a
maid
of
honour
to
queen
the
knight
was
very
inquisitive
into
her
name
and
family
and
after
having
regarded
her
finger
for
some
time
wonder
says
he
sir
has
said
nothing
of
her
in
his
chronicle
we
were
then
conveyed
to
the
two
coronation
chairs
where
my
old
friend
after
having
heard
that
the
stone
underneath
the
most
ancient
of
them
which
was
brought
from
was
called
sat
himself
down
in
the
chair
and
looking
like
the
figure
of
an
old
king
asked
our
interpreter
what
authority
they
had
to
say
that
had
ever
been
in
the
fellow
instead
of
returning
him
an
answer
told
him
that
he
hoped
his
honour
would
pay
his
forfeit
i
could
observe
sir
roger
a
little
ruffled
upon
being
thus
trepanned
but
our
guide
not
insisting
upon
his
demand
the
knight
soon
recovered
his
and
whispered
in
my
ear
that
if
will
wimble
were
with
us
and
saw
those
two
chairs
it
would
go
hard
but
he
would
get
a
out
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
sir
roger
in
the
next
place
laid
his
hand
upon
the
third
sword
and
leaning
upon
the
pommel
of
it
gave
us
the
whole
history
of
the
concluding
that
in
sir
opinion
the
third
was
one
of
the
greatest
princes
that
ever
sat
upon
the
throne
we
were
then
shewn
the
confessor
tomb
upon
which
sir
roger
acquainted
us
that
he
was
the
first
who
touched
for
the
evil
and
afterwards
the
fourth
upon
which
he
shook
his
head
and
told
us
there
was
fine
reading
in
the
casualties
of
that
reign
our
conductor
then
pointed
to
that
monument
where
there
is
the
figure
of
one
of
our
kings
without
an
head
and
upon
giving
us
to
know
that
the
head
which
was
of
beaten
silver
had
been
stolen
away
several
years
since
whig
i
warrant
you
says
sir
roger
ought
to
lock
up
your
kings
better
they
will
carry
off
the
body
too
if
you
do
take
care
the
glorious
names
of
the
fifth
and
queen
gave
the

great
opportunities
of
shining
and
of
doing
justice
to
sir
who
as
our
knight
observed
with
some
surprise
had
a
great
many
kings
in
him
whose
monuments
he
had
not
seen
in
the
abbey
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
but
be
pleased
to
see
the
knight
shew
such
an
honest
passion
for
the
glory
of
his
country
and
such
a
respectful
gratitude
to
the
memory
of
its
princes
i
must
not
omit
that
the
benevolence
of
my
good
old
friend
which
flows
out
towards
every
one
he
converses
with
made
him
very
kind
to
our
interpreter
whom
he
looked
upon
as
an
extraordinary
man
for
which
reason
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
at
parting
telling
him
that
he
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
at
his
lodgings
in
and
talk
over
these
matters

my
friend
sir
roger
de
coverley
when
we
last
met
together
at
the
club
told
me
that
he
had
a
great
mind
to
see
the
new
tragedy
with
me
assuring
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
not
been
at
a
play
these
twenty
years
last
i
saw
said
sir
roger
the
which
i
should
not
have
gone
to
neither
had
not
i
been
told
beforehand
that
it
was
a
good
comedy
he
then
proceeded
to
inquire
of
me
who
this
distressed
mother
was
and
upon
hearing
that
she
was
widow
he
told
me
that
her
husband
was
a
brave
man
and
that
when
he
was
a
he
had
read
his
life
at
the
end
of
the
dictionary
my
friend
asked
me
in
the
next
place
if
there
would
not
be
some
danger
in
coming
home
late
in
case
the
should
be
abroad
assure
you
says
he
thought
i
had
fallen
into
their
hands
last
night
for
i
observed
two
or
three
lusty
black
men
that
followed
me
half
way
up
and
mended
their
pace
behind
me
in
proportion
as
i
put
on
to
get
away
from
them
you
must
know
continued
the
knight
with
a
smile
fancied
they
had
a
mind
to
me
for
i
remember
an
honest
gentleman
in
my
neighbourhood
who
was
served
such
a
trick
in
king
the
second
time
for
which
reason
he
has
not
ventured
himself
in
town
ever
since
i
might
have
shewn
them
very
good
sport
had
this
been
their
design
for
as
i
am
an
old
i
should
have
turned
and
dogged
and
have
played
them
a
thousand
tricks
they
had
never
seen
in
their
lives
before
sir
roger
added
that
if
these
gentlemen
had
any
such
intention
they
did
not
succeed
very
well
in
it
i
threw
them
out
says
he
the
end
of
where
i
doubled
the
corner
and
got
shelter
in
my
lodgings
before
they
could
imagine
what
was
become
of
me
however
says
the
knight
captain
sentry
will
make
one
with
us
morrow
night
and
if
you
will
both
of
you
call
upon
me
about
four
that
we
may
be
at
the
house
before
it
is
full
i
will
have
my
coach
in
readiness
to
attend
you
for
tells
me
he
has
got
the
mended
the
captain
who
did
not
fail
to
meet
me
there
at
the
appointed
hour
bid
sir
roger
fear
nothing
for
that
he
had
put
on
the
same
sword
which
he
made
use
of
at
the
battle
of
sir
roger
servants
and
among
the
rest
my
old
friend
the
butler
had
i
found
provided
themselves
with
good
oaken
plants
to
attend
their
master
upon
this
occasion
when
we
had
placed
him
in
his
coach
with
myself
at
his
hand
the
captain
before
him
and
his
butler
at
the
head
of
his
footmen
in
the
rear
we
conveyed
him
in
safety
to
the
where
after
having
marched
up
the
entry
in
good
order
the
captain
and
i
went
in
with
him
and
seated
him
betwixt
us
in
the
pit
as
soon
as
the
house
was
full
and
the
candles
lighted
my
old
friend
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
with
that
pleasure
which
a
mind
seasoned
with
humanity
naturally
feels
in
itself
at
the
sight
of
a
multitude
of
people
who
seemed
pleased
with
one
another
and
partake
of
the
same
common
entertainment
i
could
not
but
fancy
to
myself
as
the
old
man
stood
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pit
that
he
made
a
very
proper
center
to
a
tragick
audience
upon
the
entering
of
the
knight
told
me
that
he
did
not
believe
the
king
of
himself
had
a
better
strut
i
was
indeed
very
attentive
to
my
old
friend
remarks
because
i
looked
upon
them
as
a
piece
of
natural
criticism
and
was
well
pleased
to
hear
him
at
the
conclusion
of
almost
every
scene
telling
me
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
play
would
end
one
while
he
appeared
much
concerned
for
and
a
little
while
after
as
much
for
and
was
extremely
puzzled
to
think
what
would
become
of
when
sir
roger
saw
obstinate
refusal
to
her
importunities
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
that
he
was
sure
she
would
never
have
him
to
which
he
added
with
a
more
than
ordinary
vehemence
can
not
imagine
sir
what
it
is
to
have
to
do
with
a
widow
upon
his
threatening
afterwards
to
leave
her
the
knight
shook
his
head
and
muttered
to
himself
do
if
you
can
this
part
dwelt
so
much
upon
my
friend
imagination
that
at
the
close
of
the
third
act
as
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
widows
sir
are
the
most
perverse
creatures
in
the
world
but
pray
says
he
that
are
a
critick
is
the
play
according
to
your
dramatic
rules
as
you
call
them
should
your
people
in
tragedy
always
talk
to
be
understood
why
there
is
not
a
single
sentence
in
this
play
that
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
act
very
luckily
begun
before
i
had
time
to
give
the
old
gentleman
an
answer
says
the
knight
sitting
down
with
great
satisfaction
i
suppose
we
are
now
to
see
ghost
he
then
renewed
his
attention
and
from
time
to
time
fell
a
praising
the
widow
he
made
indeed
a
little
mistake
as
to
one
of
her
pages
whom
at
his
first
entering
he
took
for
but
quickly
set
himself
right
in
that
particular
though
at
the
same
time
he
owned
he
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
seen
the
little
boy
says
he
needs
be
a
very
fine
child
by
the
account
that
is
given
of
him
upon
going
off
with
a
menace
to
the
audience
gave
a
loud
clap
to
which
sir
roger
added
my
word
a
notable
young
baggage
as
there
was
a
very
remarkable
silence
and
stillness
in
the
audience
during
the
whole
action
it
was
natural
for
them
to
take
the
opportunity
of
the
intervals
between
the
acts
to
express
their
opinion
of
the
players
and
of
their
respective
parts
sir
roger
hearing
a
cluster
of
them
praise
struck
in
with
them
and
told
them
that
he
thought
his
friend
was
a
very
sensible
man
as
they
were
afterwards
applauding
sir
roger
put
in
a
second
time
let
me
tell
you
says
he
he
speaks
but
little
i
like
the
old
fellow
in
whiskers
as
well
as
any
of
them
captain
sentry
seeing
two
or
three
wags
who
sat
near
us
lean
with
an
attentive
ear
towards
sir
roger
and
fearing
lest
they
should
smoke
the
knight
plucked
him
by
the
elbow
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
that
lasted
till
the
opening
of
the
fifth
act
the
knight
was
wonderfully
attentive
to
the
account
which
gives
of
his
death
and
at
the
conclusion
of
it
told
me
it
was
such
a
bloody
piece
of
work
that
he
was
glad
it
was
not
done
upon
the
stage
seeing
afterwards
in
his
raving
fit
he
grew
more
than
ordinary
serious
and
took
occasion
to
moralize
in
his
way
upon
an
evil
conscience
adding
that
in
his
madness
looked
as
if
he
saw
as
we
were
the
first
that
came
into
the
house
so
we
were
the
last
that
went
out
of
it
being
resolved
to
have
a
clear
passage
for
our
old
friend
whom
we
did
not
care
to
venture
among
the
justling
of
the
crowd
sir
roger
went
out
fully
satisfied
with
his
entertainment
and
we
guarded
him
to
his
lodging
in
the
same
manner
that
we
brought
him
to
the
being
highly
pleased
for
my
own
part
not
only
with
the
performance
of
the
excellent
piece
which
had
been
presented
but
with
the
satisfaction
which
it
had
given
to
the
old
man

my

sir

contrary
to
his
usual
custom
sat
very
silent
and
instead
of
minding
what
was
said
by
the
company
was
whistling
to
himself
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
and
playing
with
a
cork
i
jogged
sir
andrew

who
sat
between
us
and
as
we
were
both
observing
him
we
saw
the
knight
shake
his
head
and
heard
him
say
to
himself
foolish
woman
i
ca
believe
sir
andrew
gave
him
a
gentle
pat
upon
the
shoulder
and
offered
to
lay
him
a

of
wine
that
he
was
thinking
of

widow
my
old
friend
started
and
recovering
out
of
his
brown
study
told
sir
andrew
that
once
in
his
life
he
had
been
in
the
right
in
short
after
some
little
hesitation
sir
roger
told
us
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
his
steward
which
acquainted
him
that
his
old
rival
and
antagonist
in
the
country
sir
had
been
making
a
visit
to
the
widow
however
says
sir
roger
i
can
never
think
that
she
will
have
a
man
that
is
half
a
year
older
than
i
am
and
a
noted
republican
into
the
bargain
will
honeycomb
who
looks
upon
love
as
his
particular
province
interrupting
our
friend
with
a
jaunty
laugh
thought
knight
says
he
lived
long
enough
in
the
world
not
to
pin
thy
happiness
upon
one
that
is
a
woman
and
a
widow
i
think
that
without
vanity
i
may
pretend
to
know
as
much
of
the
female
world
as
any
man
in
though
the
chief
of
my
knowledge
consists
in
this
that
they
are
not
to
be
known
will
immediately
with
his
usual
fluency
rambled
into
an
account
of
his
own
amours
am
now
says
he
the
verge
of
fifty
though
by
the
way
we
all
knew
he
was
turned
of
threescore
may
easily
guess
continued
will
i
have
not
lived
so
long
in
the
world
without
having
had
some
thoughts
of
in
it
as
the
phrase
is
to
tell
you
truly
i
have
several
times
tried
my
fortune
that
way
though
i
can
not
much
boast
of
my
success
made
my
first
addresses
to
a
young
lady
in
the
country
but
when
i
thought
things
were
pretty
well
drawing
to
a
conclusion
her
father
happening
to
hear
that
i
had
formerly
boarded
with
a
surgeon
the
old
put
forbid
me
his
house
and
within
a
fortnight
after
married
his
daughter
to
a
in
the
neighbourhood
made
my
next
application
to
a
widow
and
attacked
her
so
briskly
that
i
thought
myself
within
a
fortnight
of
her
as
i
waited
upon
her
one
morning
she
told
me
that
she
intended
to
keep
her
ready
money
and
jointure
in
her
own
hand
and
desired
me
to
call
upon
her
attorney
in
who
would
adjust
with
me
what
it
was
proper
for
me
to
add
to
it
i
was
so
rebuffed
by
this
overture
that
i
never
inquired
either
for
her
or
her
attorney
afterwards
few
months
after
i
addressed
myself
to
a
young
lady
who
was
an
only
daughter
and
of
a
good
family
i
danced
with
her
at
several
balls
squeezed
her
by
the
hand
said
soft
things
to
her
and
in
short
made
no
doubt
of
her
heart
and
tho
my
fortune
was
not
equal
to
hers
i
was
in
hopes
that
her
fond
father
would
not
deny
her
the
man
she
had
fixed
her
affections
upon
but
as
i
went
one
day
to
the
house
in
order
to
break
the
matter
to
him
i
found
the
whole
family
in
confusion
and
heard
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
that
miss
was
that
morning
run
away
with
the
butler
then
courted
a
second
widow
and
am
at
a
loss
to
this
day
how
i
came
to
miss
her
for
she
had
often
commended
my
person
and
behaviour
her
maid
indeed
told
me
one
day
that
her
mistress
had
said
she
never
saw
a
gentleman
with
such
a
spindle
pair
of
legs
as
honeycomb
this
i
laid
siege
to
four
heiresses
successively
and
being
a
handsome
young
dog
in
those
days
quickly
made
a
breach
in
their
hearts
but
i
do
not
know
how
it
came
to
pass
though
i
seldom
failed
of
getting
the
daughter
consent
i
could
never
in
my
life
get
the
old
people
on
my
side
could
give
you
an
account
of
a
thousand
other
unsuccessful
attempts
particularly
of
one
which
i
made
some
years
since
upon
an
old
woman
whom
i
had
certainly
borne
away
with
flying
colours
if
her
relations
had
not
come
pouring
in
to
her
assistance
from
all
parts
of
nay
i
believe
i
should
have
got
her
at
last
had
not
she
been
carried
off
by
a
hard
frost
as
will
transitions
are
extremely
quick
he
turned
from
sir
roger
and
applying
himself
to
me
told
me
there
was
a
passage
in
the
book
i
had
considered
last
which
deserved
to
be
writ
in
letters
of
gold
and
taking
out
a
read
the
following
lines
which
are
part
of
one
of
adam
speeches
to
eve
after
the
fall
why
did
god
creator
wise
that
peopled
highest
with
spirits
masculine
create
at
last
this
novelty
on
earth
this
fair
defect
of
nature
and
not
fill
the
world
at
once
with
men
as
angels
without
feminine
or
find
some
other
way
to
generate
mankind
this
mischief
had
not
then
befallen
and
more
that
shall
befall
innumerable
disturbances
on
earth
through
female
snares
and
strait
conjunction
with
this
sex
for
either
he
never
shall
find
out
fit
mate
but
such
as
some
misfortune
brings
him
or
mistake
or
whom
he
wishes
most
shall
seldom
gain
through
her
perverseness
but
shall
see
her
by
a
far
worse
or
if
she
love
withheld
by
parents
or
his
happiest
choice
too
late
shall
meet
already
link
and
to
a
fell
adversary
his
hate
or
shame
which
infinite
calamity
shall
cause
to
human
life
and
household
peace
sir
roger
listened
to
this
passage
with
great
attention
and
desiring
honeycomb
to
fold
down
a
leaf
at
the
place
and
lend
him
his
book
the
knight
put
it
up
in
his
pocket
and
told
us
that
he
would
read
over
those
verses
again
before
he
went
to
bed
x
no
tuesday
may
debent
juv
sat
ver
a
beauteous
garden
but
by
vice
maintain
as
i
was
sitting
in
my
chamber
and
thinking
on
a
subject
for
my
next
i
heard
two
or
three
irregular
bounces
at
my
landlady
door
and
upon
the
opening
of
it
a
loud
cheerful
voice
enquiring
whether
the
philosopher
was
at
home
the
child
who
went
to
the
door
answered
very
innocently
that
he
did
not
lodge
there
i
immediately
recollected
that
it
was
my
good
friend
sir
roger
voice
and
that
i
had
promised
to
go
with
him
on
the
water
to
in
case
it
proved
a
good
evening
the
knight
put
me
in
mind
of
my
promise
from
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
but
told
me
that
if
i
was
speculating
he
would
stay
below
till
i
had
done
upon
my
coming
down
i
found
all
the

family
got
about
my
old
friend
and
my
landlady
herself
who
is
a
notable
prating
gossip
engaged
in
a
conference
with
him
being
mightily
pleased
with
his
stroking
her
little
boy
upon
the
head
and
bidding
him
be
a
good
child
and
mind
his
book
we
were
no
sooner
come
to
the
stairs
but
we
were
surrounded
with
a
crowd
of
watermen
offering
us
their
respective
services
sir
roger
after
having
looked
about
him
very
attentively
spied
one
with
a
wooden
leg
and
immediately
gave
him
orders
to
get
his
boat
ready
as
we
were
walking
towards
it
must
says
sir
roger
never
make
use
of
any
body
to
row
me
that
has
not
either
lost
a
leg
or
an
arm
i
would
rather
bate
him
a
few
strokes
of
his
oar
than
not
employ
an
honest
man
that
has
been
wounded
in
the
queen
service
if
i
was
a
lord
or
a
bishop
and
kept
a
barge
i
would
not
put
a
fellow
in
my
livery
that
had
not
a
wooden
my
old
friend
after
having
seated
himself
and
trimmed
the
boat
with
his
coachman
who
being
a
very
sober
man
always
serves
for
ballast
on
these
occasions
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
for
sir
roger
obliged
the
waterman
to
give
us
the
history
of
his
right
leg
and
hearing
that
he
had
left
it
at
with
many
particulars
which
passed
in
that
glorious
action
the
knight
in
the
triumph
of
his
heart
made
several
reflections
on
the
greatness
of
the
nation
as
that
one
could
beat
three
that
we
could
never
be
in
danger
of
popery
so
long
as
we
took
care
of
our
fleet
that
the
was
the
noblest
river
in
europe
that
was
a
greater
piece
of
work
than
any
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
with
many
other
honest
prejudices
which
naturally
cleave
to
the
heart
of
a
true
after
some
short
pause
the
old
knight
turning
about
his
head
twice
or
thrice
to
take
a
survey
of
this
great
metropolis
bid
me
observe
how
thick
the
city
was
set
with
churches
and
that
there
was
scarce
a
single
steeple
on
this
side
most
heathenish
sight
says
sir
roger
is
no
religion
at
this
end
of
the
town
the
fifty
new
churches
will
very
much
mend
the
prospect
but
is
slow
is
slow
i
do
not
remember
i
have
any
where
mentioned
in
sir
roger
character
his
custom
of
saluting
every
body
that
passes
by
him
with
a
or
a
this
the
old
man
does
out
of
the
overflowings
of
his
humanity
though
at
the
same
time
it
renders
him
so
popular
among
all
his
country
neighbours
that
it
is
thought
to
have
gone
a
good
way
in
making
him
once
or
twice
knight
of
the
shire
he
can
not
forbear
this
exercise
of
benevolence
even
in
town
when
he
meets
with
any
one
in
his
morning
or
evening
walk
it
broke
from
him
to
several
boats
that
passed
by
us
upon
the
water
but
to
the
knight
great
surprise
as
he
gave
the
to
two
or
three
young
fellows
a
little
before
our
landing
one
of
them
instead
of
returning
the
civility
asked
us
what
queer
old
put
we
had
in
the
boat
with
a
great
deal
of
the
like
ribaldry
sir
roger
seemed
a
little
shocked
at
first
but
at
length
assuming
a
face
of
magistracy
told
us
if
he
were
middlesex
he
would
make
such
vagrants
know
that
her
majesty
subjects
were
no
more
to
be
abused
by
water
than
by
we
were
now
arrived
at
which
is
exquisitely
pleasant
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
i
considered
the
fragrancy
of
the
walks
and
bowers
with
the
choirs
of
birds
that
sung
upon
the
trees
and
the
loose
tribe
of
people
that
walked
under
their
shades
i
could
not
but
look
upon
the
place
as
a
kind
of
paradise
sir
roger
told
me
it
put
him
in
mind
of
a
little
coppice
by
his
house
in
the
country
which
his
chaplain
used
to
call
an
aviary
of
nightingales
must
understand
says
the
knight
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
pleases
a
man
in
love
so
much
as
your
nightingale
ah
spectator
the
many
moonlight
nights
that
i
have
walked
by
myself
and
thought
on
the
widow
by
the
musick
of
the
nightingale
he
here
fetched
a
deep
sigh
and
was
falling
into
a
fit
of
musing
when
a
mask
who
came
behind
him
gave
him
a
gentle
tap
upon
the
shoulder
and
asked
him
if
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
mead
with
her
but
the
knight
being
startled
at
so
unexpected
a
familiarity
and
displeased
to
be
interrupted
in
his
thoughts
of
the
widow
told
her
was
a
wanton
and
bid
her
go
about
her
business
we
concluded
our
walk
with
a
glass
of
ale
and
a
slice
of
hung
beef
when
we
had
done
eating
ourselves
the
knight
called
a
waiter
to
him
and
bid
him
carry
the
remainder
to
the
waterman
that
had
but
one
leg
i
perceived
the
fellow
stared
upon
him
at
the
oddness
of
the
message
and
was
going
to
be
saucy
upon
which
i
ratified
the
commands
with
a
peremptory
look
as
we
were
going
out
of
the
garden
my
old
friend
thinking
himself
obliged
as
a
member
of
the
to
animadvert
upon
the
morals
of
the
place
told
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
sat
at
the
bar
that
he
should
be
a
better
customer
to
her
garden
if
there
were
more
nightingales

fewer

at

afflicted
every

i

sir
roger
de
coverley
he
departed
this
life
at
his
house
in
the
country
after
a
few
weeks
sickness
sir
andrew
freeport
has
a
letter
from
one
of
his
correspondents
in
those
parts
that
informs
him
the
old
man
caught
a
cold
at
the
as
he
was
very
warmly
promoting
an
address
of
his
own
penning
in
which
he
succeeded
according
to
his
wishes
but
this
particular
comes
from
a
whig
justice
of
peace
who
was
always
sir
roger
enemy
and
antagonist
i
have
letters
both
from
the
chaplain
and
captain
sentry
which
mention
nothing
of
it
but
are
filled
with
many
particulars
to
the
honour
of
the
good
old
man
i
have
likewise
a
letter
from
the
butler
who
took
so
much
care
of
me
last
summer
when
i
was
at
the
knight
house
as
my
friend
the
butler
mentions
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
several
circumstances
the
others
have
passed
over
in
silence
i
shall
give
my
reader
a
copy
of
his
letter
without
any
alteration
or
diminution
sir
that
you
was
my
old
master
good
friend
i
could
not
forbear
sending
you
the
melancholy
news
of
his
death
which
has
afflicted
the
whole
country
as
well
as
his
poor
servants
who
loved
him
i
may
say
better
than
we
did
our
lives
i
am
afraid
he
caught
his
death
the
last
where
he
would
go
to
see
justice
done
to
a
poor
widow
woman
and
her
fatherless
children
that
had
been
wronged
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
for
you
know
sir
my
good
master
was
always
the
poor
man
friend
upon
his
coming
home
the
first
complaint
he
made
was
that
he
had
lost
his
stomach
not
being
able
to
touch
a
sirloin
which
was
served
up
according
to
custom
and
you
know
he
used
to
take
great
delight
in
it
from
that
time
forward
he
grew
worse
and
worse
but
still
kept
a
good
heart
to
the
last
indeed
we
were
once
in
great
hope
of
his
recovery
upon
a
kind
message
that
was
sent
him
from
the
widow
lady
whom
he
had
made
love
to
the
forty
last
years
of
his
life
but
this
only
proved
a
lightning
before
death
he
has
bequeathed
to
this
lady
as
a
token
of
his
love
a
great
pearl
necklace
and
a
couple
of
silver
bracelets
set
with
jewels
which
belonged
to
my
good
old
lady
his
mother
he
has
bequeathed
the
fine
white
gelding
that
he
used
to
ride
upon
to
his
chaplain
because
he
thought
he
would
be
kind
to
him
and
has
left
you
all
his
books
he
has
moreover
bequeathed
to
the
chaplain
a
very
pretty
tenement
with
good
lands
about
it
it
being
a
very
cold
day
when
he
made
his
will
he
left
for
mourning
to
every
man
in
the
parish
a
great
frieze
coat
and
to
every
woman
a
black
it
was
a
most
moving
sight
to
see
him
take
leave
of
his
poor
servants
commending
us
all
for
our
fidelity
whilst
we
were
not
able
to
speak
a
word
for
weeping
as
we
most
of
us
are
grown
in
our
dear
master
service
he
has
left
us
pensions
and
legacies
which
we
may
live
very
comfortably
upon
the
remaining
part
of
our
days
he
has
bequeathed
a
great
deal
more
in
charity
which
is
not
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
and
it
is
peremptorily
said
in
the
parish
that
he
has
left
money
to
build
a
steeple
to
the
church
for
he
was
heard
to
say
some
time
ago
that
if
he
lived
two
years
longer
church
should
have
a
steeple
to
it
the
chaplain
tells
every
body
that
he
made
a
very
good
end
and
never
speaks
of
him
without
tears
he
was
buried
according
to
his
own
directions
among
the
family
of
the
coverleys
on
the
left
hand
of
his
father
sir
the
coffin
was
carried
by
six
of
his
tenants
and
the
pall
held
by
six
of
the
the
whole
parish
followed
the
corpse
with
heavy
hearts
and
in
their
mourning
suits
the
men
in
frieze
and
the
women
in
captain
sentry
my
master
nephew
has
taken
possession
of
the
and
the
whole
estate
when
my
old
master
saw
him
a
little
before
his
death
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
wished
him
joy
of
the
estate
which
was
falling
to
him
desiring
him
only
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
and
to
pay
the
several
legacies
and
the
gifts
of
charity
which
he
told
him
he
had
left
as
upon
the
estate
the
captain
truly
seems
a
courteous
man
though
he
says
but
little
he
makes
much
of
those
whom
my
master
loved
and
shews
great
kindnesses
to
the
old
dog
that
you
know
my
poor
master
was
so
fond
of
it
would
have
gone
to
your
heart
to
have
heard
the
moans
the
dumb
creature
made
on
the
day
of
my
master
death
he
has
never
joyed
himself
since
no
more
has
any
of
us
it
was
the
melancholiest
day
for
the
poor
people
that
ever
happened
in
this
is
all
from
sir
most
sorrowful
servant
biscuit
my
master
desired
some
weeks
before
he
died
that
a
book
which
comes
up
to
you
by
the
carrier
should
be
given
to
sir
andrew
freeport
in
his
name
this
letter
notwithstanding
the
poor
butler
manner
of
writing
it
gave
us
such
an
idea
of
our
good
old
friend
that
upon
the
reading
of
it
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
club
sir
andrew
opening
the
book
found
it
to
be

was

some
passages
in

sir
andrew

they
related

points
which
he
had
disputed
with
sir
roger

time

appeared

the
club
sir
andrew

would
have
been

that
they
were
