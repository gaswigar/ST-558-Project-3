april
hopes
by
william
dean
howells
i
from
his
place
on
the
floor
of
the
hemenway
gymnasium
elbridge
mavering
looked
on
at
the
class
day
gaiety
with
the
advantage
which
his
stature
gave
him
over
most
people
there
hundreds
of
these
were
pretty
girls
in
a
great
variety
of
charming
costumes
such
as
the
eclecticism
of
modern
fashion
permits
and
all
sorts
of
ingenious
compromises
between
walking
dress
and
ball
dress
it
struck
him
that
the
young
men
on
whose
arms
they
hung
in
promenading
around
the
long
oval
within
the
crowd
of
stationary
spectators
were
very
much
younger
than
students
used
to
be
whether
they
wore
the
of
the
seniors
or
the
of
the
juniors
and
sophomores
and
the
young
girls
themselves
did
not
look
so
old
as
he
remembered
them
in
his
day
there
was
a
band
playing
somewhere
and
the
galleries
were
well
filled
with
spectators
seated
at
their
ease
and
intent
on
the
turmoil
of
the
floor
where
from
time
to
time
the
younger
promenaders
broke
away
from
the
ranks
into
a
waltz
and
after
some
turns
drifted
back
smiling
and
controlling
their
quick
breath
and
resumed
their
promenade
the
place
was
intensely
light
in
the
candour
of
a
summer
day
which
had
no
reserves
and
the
brilliancy
was
not
broken
by
the
simple
decorations
ropes
of
wild
laurel
twisted
up
the
pine
posts
of
the
aisles
and
swung
in
festoons
overhead
masses
of
tropical
plants
in
pots
were
set
along
between
the
posts
on
one
side
of
the
room
and
on
the
other
were
the
lunch
tables
where
a
great
many
people
were
standing
about
eating
chicken
and
salmon
salads
or
strawberries
and
and
drinking
from
the
whole
rose
that
blended
odour
of
viands
of
flowers
of
stuff
of
toilet
perfumes
which
is
the
characteristic
expression
of
all
social
festivities
and
which
exhilarates
or
depresses
according
as
one
is
new
or
old
to
it
elbridge
mavering
kept
looking
at
the
faces
of
the
young
men
as
if
he
expected
to
see
a
certain
one
then
he
turned
his
eyes
patiently
upon
the
faces
around
him
he
had
been
introduced
to
a
good
many
persons
but
he
had
come
to
that
time
of
life
when
an
introduction
unless
charged
with
some
special
interest
only
adds
the
pain
of
doubt
to
the
wearisome
encounter
of
unfamiliar
people
and
he
had
unconsciously
put
on
the
severity
of
a
man
who
finds
himself
without
acquaintance
where
others
are
meeting
friends
when
a
small
man
with
a
neatly
trimmed
beard
and
prominent
eyes
stepped
in
front
of
him
and
saluted
him
with
the
hello
mavering
of
a
contemporary
his
face
after
a
moment
of
question
relaxed
into
joyful
recognition
why
john
munt
is
that
you
he
said
and
he
took
into
his
large
moist
palm
the
dry
little
hand
of
his
friend
while
they
both
broke
out
into
the
incoherencies
of
people
meeting
after
a
long
time
mavering
spoke
in
it
voice
soft
yet
firm
and
with
a
certain
thickness
of
tongue
which
gave
a
boyish
charm
to
his
slow
utterance
and
munt
used
the
sort
of
bronchial
snuffle
sometimes
cultivated
among
us
as
a
chest
tone
but
they
were
cut
short
in
their
intersecting
questions
and
exclamations
by
the
presence
of
the
lady
who
detached
herself
from
munt
arm
as
if
to
leave
him
the
freer
for
his
oh
he
said
suddenly
recurring
to
her
let
me
introduce
you
to
pasmer
mavering
and
the
latter
made
a
bow
that
creased
his
waistcoat
at
about
the
height
of
pasmer
pretty
little
nose
his
waistcoat
had
the
curve
which
waistcoats
often
describe
at
his
age
and
his
heavy
shoulders
were
thrown
well
back
to
balance
this
curve
his
coat
hung
carelessly
open
the
panama
hat
in
his
hand
suggested
a
certain
habitual
informality
of
dress
but
his
smoothly
shaven
large
handsome
face
with
its
jaws
slowly
ruminant
upon
nothing
intimated
the
consequence
of
a
man
accustomed
to
supremacy
in
a
subordinate
place
pasmer
looked
up
to
acknowledge
the
introduction
with
a
sort
of
which
it
would
be
hard
otherwise
to
describe
whether
she
divined
or
not
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
magnate
of
some
sort
she
was
rather
superfluously
demure
in
the
first
two
or
three
things
she
said
and
was
all
sympathy
and
interest
in
the
meeting
of
these
old
friends
they
declared
that
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
twenty
years
or
at
any
rate
not
since
she
listened
while
they
disputed
about
the
exact
date
and
looked
from
time
to
time
at
munt
as
if
for
some
explanation
of
mavering
but
munt
himself
when
she
saw
him
last
had
only
just
begun
to
commend
himself
to
society
which
had
since
so
fully
accepted
him
and
she
had
so
suddenly
the
moment
before
found
her
self
hand
in
glove
with
him
that
she
might
well
have
appealed
to
a
third
person
for
some
explanation
of
munt
but
she
was
not
a
woman
to
be
troubled
much
by
this
momentary
mystification
and
she
was
not
embarrassed
at
all
when
munt
said
as
if
it
had
all
been
well
now
pasmer
if
you
let
me
leave
you
with
mavering
a
moment
i
go
off
and
bring
that
unnatural
child
to
you
no
use
dragging
you
round
through
this
crowd
he
made
a
gesture
intended
in
the
american
manner
to
be
at
once
polite
and
jocose
and
was
gone
leaving
pasmer
a
little
surprised
and
mavering
in
some
misgiving
which
he
tried
to
overcome
pressing
his
jaws
together
two
or
three
times
without
speaking
she
had
no
trouble
in
getting
in
the
first
remark
is
all
this
charming
mavering
she
spoke
in
a
deep
low
voice
with
a
caressing
manner
and
stood
looking
up
at
mavering
with
one
shoulder
shrugged
and
the
other
drooped
and
a
tasteful
composition
of
her
fan
and
hands
and
handkerchief
at
her
waist
yes
it
is
said
mavering
he
seemed
to
say
to
her
with
a
public
or
official
accent
which
sent
primer
mind
fluttering
forth
to
poise
briefly
at
such
conjectures
as
congressman
from
a
country
district
judge
of
the
common
pleas
bank
president
railroad
superintendent
leading
physician
in
a
large
town
no
munt
said
mister
and
then
to
return
to
her
pretty
blue
eyes
and
to
centre
there
in
that
attention
under
the
arch
of
her
neat
brows
and
her
soberly
crinkled
brown
hair
and
her
very
appropriate
bonnet
a
bonnet
she
said
was
much
more
than
half
the
battle
after
forty
and
it
was
now
quite
after
forty
with
pasmer
but
she
was
very
well
dressed
otherwise
mavering
went
on
to
say
with
a
deliberation
that
seemed
an
element
of
his
unknown
dignity
whatever
it
might
be
a
number
of
the
young
fellows
together
can
give
a
much
finer
spread
and
make
more
of
the
day
in
a
place
like
this
than
we
used
to
do
in
our
ah
then
you
a
harvard
man
too
said
primer
to
herself
with
surprise
which
she
kept
to
herself
and
she
said
to
mavering
oh
yes
indeed
it
altogether
better
are
they
nice
looking
fellows
she
said
putting
up
her
glass
to
look
at
the
promenaders
yes
mavering
assented
i
suppose
he
added
out
of
the
consciousness
of
his
own
relation
to
the
affair
i
suppose
you
a
son
somewhere
here
oh
dear
no
cried
primer
with
a
mingling
superhuman
but
for
her
of
ironical
deprecation
and
derision
only
a
daughter
at
this
feat
of
pasmer
mavering
looked
at
her
with
question
as
to
her
precise
intention
and
ended
by
repeating
hopelessly
only
a
daughter
yes
said
pasmer
with
a
sigh
of
the
same
irony
only
a
poor
despised
young
girl
you
speak
said
mavering
beginning
to
catch
on
a
little
as
if
it
were
a
misfortune
and
his
dignity
broke
up
into
a
smile
that
had
its
queer
fascination
why
is
it
asked
pasmer
well
i
should
have
thought
then
you
do
believe
that
all
that
chivalry
and
devotion
have
gone
out
you
do
think
the
young
men
are
all
spoiled
nowadays
and
expect
the
young
ladies
to
offer
them
attentions
no
said
mavering
slowly
as
if
recovering
from
the
shock
of
the
novel
ideas
do
you
oh
i
such
a
stranger
in
boston
i
lived
abroad
so
long
that
i
do
know
one
hears
all
kinds
of
things
but
i
so
glad
you
not
one
of
those
pessimists
well
said
mavering
still
thoughtfully
i
do
know
that
i
can
speak
by
the
card
exactly
i
ca
say
how
it
is
now
i
have
been
at
a
class
day
spread
since
my
own
class
day
i
have
even
been
at
commencement
more
than
once
or
twice
but
in
my
time
here
we
expect
the
young
ladies
to
show
us
attentions
at
any
rate
we
wait
for
them
to
do
it
we
were
very
glad
to
be
asked
to
meet
them
and
we
thought
it
an
honour
if
the
young
ladies
would
let
us
talk
or
dance
with
them
or
take
them
to
picnics
i
do
think
that
any
of
them
could
complain
of
want
of
yes
said
pasmer
that
what
i
preached
that
what
i
prophesied
when
i
brought
my
daughter
home
from
europe
i
told
her
that
a
girl
life
in
america
was
one
long
triumph
but
they
say
now
that
girls
have
more
attention
in
london
even
than
in
cambridge
one
hears
such
dreadful
things
like
what
asked
mavering
with
the
unserious
interest
which
primer
made
most
people
feel
in
her
talk
oh
it
too
vast
a
subject
but
they
tell
you
about
charming
girls
moping
the
whole
evening
through
at
boston
parties
with
no
young
men
to
talk
with
and
sitting
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
an
assembly
and
not
going
on
the
floor
once
they
say
that
unless
a
girl
fairly
throws
herself
at
the
young
men
heads
she
is
noticed
it
this
terrible
disproportion
of
the
sexes
that
at
the
root
of
it
i
suppose
it
reverses
everything
there
are
enough
young
men
to
go
half
round
and
they
know
it
and
take
advantage
of
it
i
suppose
it
began
in
the
he
laughed
and
i
should
think
he
said
laying
hold
of
a
single
idea
out
of
several
which
she
had
presented
that
there
would
always
be
enough
young
men
in
cambridge
to
go
pasmer
gave
a
little
cry
in
cambridge
yes
when
i
was
in
college
our
superiority
was
entirely
but
that
all
passed
long
ago
from
what
i
hear
retorted
pasmer
i
know
very
well
that
it
used
to
be
thought
a
great
advantage
for
a
girl
to
be
brought
up
in
cambridge
because
it
gave
her
independence
and
ease
of
manner
to
have
so
many
young
men
attentive
to
her
but
they
say
the
students
all
go
into
boston
now
and
if
the
cambridge
girls
want
to
meet
them
they
have
to
go
there
too
oh
i
assure
you
that
from
what
i
hear
they
changed
all
that
since
our
time
pasmer
was
certainly
letting
herself
go
a
little
more
than
she
would
have
approved
of
in
another
the
result
was
apparent
in
the
jocosity
of
this
heavy
mavering
reply
well
then
i
glad
that
i
was
of
our
time
and
not
of
this
wicked
generation
but
i
presume
that
unnatural
supremacy
of
the
young
men
is
brought
low
so
to
speak
after
marriage
primer
let
herself
go
a
little
further
oh
give
us
an
equal
chance
she
laughed
and
we
can
always
take
care
of
ourselves
and
something
more
they
say
she
added
that
the
young
married
women
now
have
all
the
attention
that
girls
could
h
said
mavering
frowning
i
think
i
should
be
tempted
to
box
my
boy
ears
if
i
saw
him
paying
another
man
wife
what
a
roman
father
cried
pasmer
greatly
amused
and
letting
herself
go
a
little
further
yet
she
said
to
herself
that
she
really
must
find
out
who
this
remarkable
mavering
was
and
she
cast
her
eye
over
the
hall
for
some
glimpse
of
the
absent
munt
whose
arm
she
meant
to
take
and
whose
ear
she
meant
to
fill
with
questions
but
she
did
not
see
him
and
something
else
suggested
itself
he
probably
would
let
you
see
him
or
if
he
did
you
would
know
how
not
know
it
primer
did
not
answer
one
hears
such
dreadful
things
what
do
you
say
or
you
think
i
a
terrible
gossip
oh
no
said
mavering
impatient
for
the
dreadful
thing
whatever
it
was
primer
resumed
to
the
young
married
women
meeting
last
winter
just
after
a
lot
of
pretty
girls
had
came
out
and
magnanimously
resolving
to
give
the
buds
a
chance
in
society
the
buds
yes
the
the
debutantes
it
an
odious
little
word
but
everybody
uses
it
do
you
think
that
a
strange
state
of
things
for
america
but
i
ca
believe
all
those
things
said
pasmer
flinging
off
the
shadow
of
this
lurid
social
condition
is
this
a
pretty
scene
yes
it
is
mavering
admitted
withdrawing
his
mind
gradually
from
a
consideration
of
pasmer
awful
instances
yes
he
added
in
final
the
young
fellows
certainly
do
things
in
a
great
deal
better
style
nowadays
than
we
used
oh
yes
indeed
and
all
those
pretty
girls
do
seem
to
be
having
such
a
good
time
yes
they
do
have
the
despised
and
rejected
appearance
that
like
to
have
one
not
in
the
least
pasmer
readily
consented
they
look
radiantly
happy
it
shows
that
you
ca
trust
anything
that
people
say
to
she
abandoned
the
ground
she
had
just
been
taking
without
apparent
shame
for
her
inconsistency
i
fancy
it
pretty
much
as
it
always
been
if
a
girl
is
attractive
the
young
men
find
it
perhaps
said
mavering
unbending
with
dignity
the
young
married
women
have
held
another
meeting
and
resolved
to
give
the
buds
one
more
oh
there
are
some
pretty
mature
roses
here
said
pasmer
laughing
evasively
but
i
suppose
class
day
can
never
be
taken
from
the
young
i
hope
not
said
mavering
his
wandering
eye
fell
upon
some
young
men
bringing
refreshments
across
the
nave
toward
them
and
he
was
reminded
to
ask
pasmer
will
you
have
something
to
eat
he
had
himself
had
a
good
deal
to
eat
before
he
took
up
his
position
at
the
advantageous
point
where
john
munt
had
found
him
why
yes
thank
you
said
pasmer
i
ought
to
say
ice
please
but
i
really
hungry
and
i
get
you
some
of
the
salad
said
mavering
with
the
increased
liking
a
man
feels
for
a
woman
when
she
owns
to
an
appetite
sit
down
here
he
added
and
he
caught
a
vacant
chair
toward
her
when
he
turned
about
from
doing
so
he
confronted
a
young
gentleman
coming
up
to
pasmer
with
a
young
lady
on
his
arm
and
making
a
very
low
bow
of
relinquishment
ii
the
men
looked
smilingly
at
each
other
without
saying
anything
and
the
younger
took
in
due
form
the
introduction
which
the
young
lady
gave
him
my
mother
mr
mavering
cried
pasmer
in
a
pure
astonishment
before
she
had
time
to
colour
it
with
a
polite
variety
of
more
conventional
emotions
she
glanced
at
the
two
men
and
gave
a
little
oh
of
inquiry
and
resignation
and
then
said
demurely
let
me
introduce
you
to
mavering
alice
while
the
young
fellow
laughed
nervously
and
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
partly
to
hide
the
play
of
his
laughter
and
partly
to
wipe
away
the
perspiration
which
a
great
deal
more
laughing
had
already
gathered
on
his
forehead
he
had
a
vein
that
showed
prominently
down
its
centre
and
large
mobile
girlish
blue
eyes
under
good
brows
an
arched
nose
and
rather
a
long
face
and
narrow
chin
he
had
beautiful
white
teeth
as
he
laughed
these
were
seen
set
in
a
jaw
that
contracted
very
much
toward
the
front
he
was
tall
and
slim
and
he
wore
with
elegance
the
evening
dress
which
class
day
custom
prescribes
for
the
seniors
in
his
he
had
a
club
button
i
shall
not
have
to
ask
an
introduction
to
mavering
and
robbed
me
of
the
pleasure
of
giving
him
one
to
you
pasmer
he
said
she
heard
the
young
man
in
the
course
of
a
swift
review
of
what
she
had
said
to
his
father
and
with
a
formless
resentment
of
the
father
not
having
told
her
he
had
a
son
there
but
she
answered
with
the
flattering
sympathy
she
had
the
use
of
oh
but
you
wo
miss
one
pleasure
out
of
so
many
mavering
and
think
of
the
little
dramatic
surprise
oh
perfect
he
said
with
another
laugh
i
told
miss
pasmer
as
we
came
oh
then
you
were
in
the
surprise
alice
said
pasmer
searching
her
daughter
eyes
for
confession
or
denial
of
this
little
community
of
interest
the
girl
smiled
slightly
upon
the
young
man
but
not
disapprovingly
and
made
no
other
answer
to
her
mother
who
went
on
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
did
munt
find
you
who
told
you
where
i
was
did
you
see
me
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
was
there
ever
anything
so
droll
she
did
not
mean
her
questions
to
be
answered
or
at
least
not
then
for
while
her
daughter
continued
to
smile
rather
more
absently
and
young
mavering
broke
out
continuously
in
his
nervous
laugh
and
his
father
stood
regarding
him
with
visible
satisfaction
she
hummed
on
turning
to
the
young
man
but
i
quite
appalled
at
having
monopolised
even
for
a
few
minutes
a
whole
senior
and
probably
an
official
senior
at
that
she
said
with
a
glance
at
the
pink
and
white
club
button
in
his
coat
lapel
and
i
ca
let
you
stay
another
instant
mavering
i
know
very
well
how
many
demands
you
have
upon
you
and
you
must
go
back
directly
to
your
sisters
and
your
cousins
and
your
aunts
and
all
the
rest
of
them
you
must
oh
no
do
drive
me
away
pasmer
pleaded
the
young
man
laughing
violently
and
then
wiping
his
face
i
assure
you
that
no
encumbrances
of
any
kind
here
except
my
father
and
he
seems
to
have
been
taking
very
good
care
of
they
all
laughed
at
this
and
the
young
fellow
hurried
on
do
be
alarmed
at
my
button
it
only
means
a
love
of
personal
decoration
if
that
where
you
got
the
notion
of
my
being
an
official
senior
this
is
my
spread
i
shall
hope
to
welcome
you
at
beck
hall
after
the
tree
and
i
wish
you
let
me
be
of
use
to
you
would
you
like
to
go
round
to
some
of
the
smaller
spreads
i
think
it
would
amuse
you
and
have
you
got
tickets
to
the
tree
to
see
us
make
fools
of
ourselves
it
worth
seeing
pasmer
i
assure
he
rattled
on
very
rapidly
but
with
such
a
frankness
in
his
urgency
such
amiable
kindliness
that
pasmer
could
not
feel
that
it
was
pushing
she
looked
at
her
daughter
but
she
stood
as
passive
in
the
transaction
as
the
elder
mavering
she
was
taller
than
her
mother
and
as
she
waited
her
supple
figure
described
that
fine
lateral
curve
which
one
sees
in
some
louis
quinze
portraits
this
effect
was
enhanced
by
the
fashion
of
her
dress
of
pale
sage
green
with
a
wide
stripe
or
sash
of
white
dropping
down
the
front
from
her
delicate
waist
the
same
simple
combination
of
colours
was
carried
up
into
her
hat
which
surmounted
darker
hair
than
pasmer
and
a
complexion
of
wholesome
pallor
her
eyes
were
grey
and
grave
with
black
brows
and
her
face
which
was
rather
narrow
had
a
pleasing
irregularity
in
the
sharp
jut
of
the
nose
in
profile
the
parting
of
the
red
lips
showed
well
back
into
the
cheek
i
do
know
said
pasmer
in
her
own
behalf
and
she
added
in
his
about
letting
you
take
so
much
trouble
so
smoothly
that
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
to
detect
the
point
of
union
in
the
two
utterances
well
do
call
it
names
anyway
pasmer
pleaded
the
young
man
i
thought
it
was
nothing
but
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
the
fact
is
she
explained
neither
consenting
nor
refusing
that
we
were
expecting
to
meet
some
friends
who
had
tickets
for
us
young
mavering
face
fell
and
i
ca
imagine
what
oh
let
hope
something
dreadful
he
cried
perhaps
you
know
them
she
delayed
further
professor
saintsbury
well
rather
why
they
were
here
about
an
hour
ago
both
of
them
they
must
have
been
looking
for
yes
we
were
to
meet
them
here
we
waited
to
come
out
with
other
friends
and
i
was
afraid
we
were
pasmer
face
expressed
a
tempered
disappointment
and
she
looked
at
her
daughter
for
indications
of
her
wishes
in
the
circumstances
seeing
in
her
eye
a
willingness
to
accept
young
mavering
invitation
she
hesitated
more
decidedly
than
she
had
yet
done
for
she
was
other
things
being
equal
quite
willing
to
accept
it
herself
but
other
things
were
not
equal
and
the
whole
situation
was
very
odd
all
that
she
knew
of
mavering
the
elder
was
that
he
was
the
old
friend
of
john
munt
and
she
knew
far
too
little
of
john
munt
except
that
he
seemed
to
go
everywhere
and
to
be
welcome
not
to
feel
that
his
introduction
was
hardly
a
warrant
for
what
looked
like
an
impending
intimacy
she
did
not
dislike
mavering
he
was
evidently
a
country
person
of
great
and
no
doubt
of
entire
respectability
he
seemed
very
intelligent
too
he
was
a
harvard
man
he
had
rather
a
cultivated
manner
or
else
naturally
a
clever
way
of
saying
things
but
all
that
was
really
nothing
if
she
knew
no
more
about
him
and
she
certainly
did
not
if
she
could
only
have
asked
her
daughter
who
it
was
that
presented
young
mavering
to
her
that
might
have
formed
some
clew
but
there
was
no
earthly
chance
of
asking
this
and
besides
it
was
probably
one
of
those
haphazard
introductions
that
people
give
on
such
occasions
young
mavering
behaviour
gave
her
still
greater
question
his
his
entire
absence
of
anxiety
or
any
expectation
of
rebuff
or
snub
might
be
the
ease
of
unimpeachable
social
acceptance
or
it
might
be
merely
adventurous
effrontery
only
something
ingenuous
and
good
in
the
young
fellow
handsome
face
forbade
this
conclusion
that
his
face
was
so
handsome
was
another
of
the
complications
she
recalled
in
the
dreamlike
swiftness
with
which
all
these
things
passed
through
her
mind
what
her
friends
had
said
to
alice
about
her
being
sure
to
meet
her
fate
on
class
day
and
she
looked
at
her
again
to
see
if
she
had
met
it
well
mamma
said
the
girl
smiling
at
her
mother
look
pasmer
thought
she
must
have
been
keeping
young
mavering
waiting
a
long
time
for
his
answer
why
of
course
alice
but
i
really
know
what
to
do
about
the
this
was
not
in
the
least
true
but
it
instantly
seemed
so
to
pasmer
as
a
plausible
excuse
will
when
we
make
it
why
i
tell
you
what
pasmer
said
young
mavering
with
a
cordial
unsuspicion
that
both
won
and
reassured
her
we
be
sure
to
find
them
at
some
of
the
spreads
let
me
be
of
that
much
use
anyway
you
we
really
ought
to
let
you
said
pasmer
making
a
last
effort
to
cling
to
her
reluctance
but
feeling
it
fail
with
a
sensation
that
was
not
disagreeable
she
could
not
help
being
pleased
with
the
pleasure
that
she
saw
in
her
daughter
face
young
mavering
was
radiant
i
be
back
in
just
half
a
minute
he
said
and
he
took
a
gay
leave
of
them
in
running
to
speak
to
another
student
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
iii
you
must
allow
me
to
get
you
something
to
eat
first
pasmer
said
the
elder
mavering
oh
no
thank
you
pasmer
began
but
she
changed
her
mind
and
said
or
yes
i
will
mavering
a
very
little
salad
she
had
really
forgotten
her
hunger
as
a
woman
will
in
the
presence
of
any
social
interest
but
she
suddenly
thought
his
going
would
give
her
a
chance
for
two
words
with
her
daughter
and
so
she
sent
him
as
he
creaked
heavily
across
the
smooth
floor
of
the
nave
alice
she
whispered
i
do
know
exactly
what
i
done
who
introduced
this
young
mavering
to
you
mr
mr
munt
yes
he
came
for
me
he
said
you
sent
him
he
introduced
mavering
and
he
was
very
polite
mavering
said
we
ought
to
go
up
into
the
gallery
and
see
how
it
looked
and
munt
said
he
been
up
and
mavering
promised
to
bring
me
back
to
him
but
he
was
not
there
when
we
got
back
mavering
got
me
some
ice
cream
first
and
then
he
found
you
for
really
said
pasmer
to
herself
the
combat
thickens
to
her
daughter
she
said
he
very
he
laughs
too
much
said
the
daughter
her
mother
recognised
her
uncandour
with
a
glance
but
he
waltzes
well
added
the
girl
waltzes
echoed
the
mother
did
you
waltz
with
him
alice
everybody
else
was
dancing
he
asked
me
for
a
turn
or
two
and
of
course
i
did
it
what
difference
oh
none
none
only
i
did
see
perhaps
you
were
yes
i
was
looking
all
the
what
do
you
mean
mamma
well
said
pasmer
in
a
final
despair
we
do
know
anything
about
we
the
only
people
here
who
do
then
said
her
daughter
the
ladies
were
bowing
right
left
to
him
all
the
time
and
he
kept
asking
if
i
knew
this
one
and
that
one
and
all
i
could
say
was
that
some
of
them
were
distant
cousins
but
i
was
acquainted
with
them
i
would
think
he
wonder
who
we
yes
said
the
mother
thoughtfully
there
he
laughing
with
that
other
student
but
do
look
pasmer
saw
well
enough
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
the
joking
that
went
on
between
mavering
and
his
friend
and
it
did
not
displease
her
to
think
that
it
probably
referred
to
alice
while
the
young
man
came
hurrying
back
to
them
she
glanced
at
the
girl
standing
near
her
with
a
keenly
critical
inspection
from
which
she
was
able
to
exclude
all
maternal
partiality
and
justly
decided
that
she
was
one
of
the
most
effective
girls
in
the
place
that
costume
of
hers
was
perfect
pasmer
wished
now
that
she
could
have
compared
it
more
carefully
with
other
costumes
she
had
noticed
some
very
pretty
ones
and
a
feeling
of
vexation
that
alice
should
have
prevented
this
by
being
away
so
long
just
when
the
crowd
was
densest
qualified
her
satisfaction
the
people
were
going
very
fast
now
the
line
of
the
oval
in
the
nave
was
broken
into
groups
of
lingering
talkers
who
were
conspicuous
to
each
other
and
pasmer
felt
that
she
and
her
daughter
were
conspicuous
to
all
the
rest
where
they
stood
apart
with
the
two
maverings
converging
upon
them
from
different
points
the
son
nodding
and
laughing
to
friends
of
both
sexes
as
he
came
the
father
wholly
absorbed
in
not
spilling
the
glass
of
claret
punch
which
he
carried
in
one
hand
and
not
falling
down
on
the
slippery
floor
with
the
plate
of
salad
which
he
bore
in
the
other
she
had
thoughts
of
feigning
unconsciousness
she
would
have
had
no
scruple
in
practising
this
or
any
other
social
stratagem
for
though
she
kept
a
conscience
in
regard
to
certain
matters
what
she
considered
essentials
she
lived
a
thousand
little
lies
every
day
and
taught
her
daughter
by
precept
and
example
to
do
the
same
you
must
seem
to
be
looking
one
way
when
you
were
really
looking
another
you
must
say
this
when
you
meant
that
you
must
act
as
if
you
were
thinking
one
thing
when
you
were
thinking
something
quite
different
and
all
to
no
end
for
as
she
constantly
said
people
always
know
perfectly
well
what
you
were
about
whichever
way
you
looked
or
whatever
you
said
or
no
matter
how
well
you
acted
the
part
of
thinking
what
you
did
not
think
now
although
she
seemed
not
to
look
she
saw
all
that
has
been
described
at
a
glance
and
at
another
she
saw
young
mavering
slide
easily
up
to
his
father
and
relieve
him
of
the
plate
and
glass
with
a
laugh
as
pleasant
and
a
show
of
teeth
as
dazzling
as
he
bestowed
upon
any
of
the
ladies
he
had
passed
she
owned
to
her
recondite
heart
that
she
liked
this
in
young
mavering
though
at
the
same
time
she
asked
herself
what
motive
he
really
had
in
being
so
polite
to
his
father
before
people
but
she
had
no
time
to
decide
she
had
only
time
to
pack
the
question
hurriedly
away
for
future
consideration
when
young
mavering
arrived
at
her
elbow
and
she
turned
with
a
little
oh
of
surprise
so
perfectly
acted
that
it
gave
her
the
greatest
pleasure
iv
i
do
think
my
father
would
have
got
here
alive
with
these
things
said
young
mavering
did
you
see
how
i
came
to
his
rescue
pasmer
instantly
threw
away
all
pretext
of
not
having
seen
oh
yes
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
when
you
bore
down
upon
him
mavering
it
was
a
beautiful
instance
of
filial
well
do
sit
down
now
pasmer
and
take
it
comfortably
said
the
young
fellow
and
he
got
her
one
of
the
many
empty
chairs
and
would
not
give
her
the
things
which
he
put
in
another
till
she
sat
down
and
let
him
spread
a
napkin
over
her
lap
really
she
said
i
feel
as
if
i
were
stopping
all
the
wheels
of
class
day
am
i
keeping
them
from
closing
the
gymnasium
mavering
not
quite
said
the
young
man
with
one
of
his
laughs
i
believe
they
will
turn
us
out
and
i
see
that
they
do
lock
us
in
do
hurry
pasmer
i
only
sorry
you
had
something
oh
your
father
proposed
getting
me
something
a
good
while
did
he
then
i
wonder
you
have
had
it
he
usually
on
you
both
very
energetic
i
think
said
pasmer
he
the
father
of
his
son
said
the
young
fellow
assuming
the
merit
with
a
bow
of
burlesque
modesty
it
went
to
pasmer
heart
let
hope
he
never
forget
that
she
said
in
an
enjoyment
of
the
excitement
and
the
salad
that
was
beginning
to
leave
her
question
of
these
maverings
a
light
diaphanous
cloud
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
the
elder
mavering
had
been
trying
without
success
to
think
of
something
to
say
to
miss
pasmer
he
had
twice
cleared
his
throat
for
that
purpose
but
this
comedy
between
his
son
and
the
young
mother
seemed
so
much
lighter
and
brighter
than
anything
he
could
have
said
that
he
said
nothing
and
looked
on
with
his
mouth
set
in
its
queer
smile
while
the
girl
listened
with
the
gravity
of
a
daughter
who
sees
that
her
mother
is
losing
her
head
pasmer
buzzed
on
in
her
badinage
with
the
young
man
and
allowed
him
to
go
for
a
cup
of
coffee
before
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
shook
out
her
skirts
with
an
air
of
pleasant
expectation
of
whatever
should
come
next
he
came
back
without
it
the
coffee
urn
has
dried
up
here
pasmer
but
you
can
get
some
at
the
other
spreads
they
be
inconsolable
if
you
did
take
something
they
all
started
toward
the
door
but
the
elder
mavering
said
holding
back
a
little
dan
i
think
i
go
and
see
oh
no
you
must
father
cried
the
young
man
laying
his
hand
with
caressing
entreaty
on
his
father
coat
sleeve
i
do
want
you
to
go
anywhere
till
you
seen
professor
saintsbury
we
shall
be
sure
to
meet
him
at
some
of
the
spreads
i
want
you
to
have
that
talk
with
him
he
corrected
himself
for
the
instant
deflection
from
the
interests
of
his
guest
and
added
i
want
you
to
help
me
hunt
him
up
for
pasmer
now
pasmer
you
not
to
think
it
the
least
trouble
or
anything
but
a
boon
much
less
say
it
he
cried
turning
to
the
deprecation
in
pasmer
face
he
turned
away
from
it
to
acknowledge
the
smiles
and
bows
of
people
going
out
of
the
place
and
he
returned
their
salutations
with
charming
heartiness
in
the
vestibule
they
met
the
friends
they
were
going
in
search
of
with
mavering
of
course
exclaimed
saintsbury
i
might
have
known
pasmer
would
have
given
anything
she
could
think
of
to
be
able
to
ask
why
her
friend
might
have
known
it
but
for
the
present
they
could
only
fall
upon
each
other
with
flashes
of
and
explanation
and
rejoicing
for
their
deferred
and
now
accomplished
meeting
the
professor
stood
by
with
the
satirical
smile
with
which
men
witness
the
effusion
of
women
young
mavering
after
sharing
the
excitement
fully
with
them
rewarded
himself
by
an
exclusive
moment
with
miss
pasmer
you
must
get
pasmer
to
let
me
show
you
all
of
class
day
that
a
senior
can
i
did
know
what
a
perfect
serpent
tooth
it
was
to
be
one
before
saintsbury
he
broke
off
have
you
got
tickets
for
the
tree
ah
she
does
hear
me
saintsbury
was
just
then
saying
to
the
elder
mavering
i
so
glad
you
decided
to
come
today
it
would
have
been
a
shame
if
none
of
you
were
she
made
a
feint
of
dropping
her
voice
with
a
glance
at
dan
mavering
he
such
a
nice
boy
which
made
him
laugh
and
cry
out
oh
now
do
poison
my
father
mind
oh
some
one
would
be
sure
to
tell
him
retorted
the
professor
wife
and
he
better
hear
it
from
a
the
young
fellow
laughed
again
and
then
he
shook
hands
with
some
ladies
going
out
and
asked
were
they
going
so
soon
from
an
abstract
hospitality
apparently
for
he
was
not
one
of
the
hosts
and
so
turned
once
more
to
miss
pasmer
we
must
get
away
from
here
or
the
afternoon
will
get
away
from
us
and
leave
us
nothing
to
show
for
it
suppose
we
make
a
start
miss
pasmer
he
led
the
way
with
her
out
of
the
vestibule
banked
round
with
pots
of
palm
and
fern
and
down
the
steps
into
the
glare
of
the
cambridge
sunshine
blown
full
as
is
the
case
on
class
day
of
fine
cambridge
dust
which
had
drawn
a
delicate
grey
veil
over
the
grass
of
the
gymnasium
lawn
and
mounted
in
light
clouds
from
the
wheels
powdering
it
finer
and
finer
in
the
street
along
the
sidewalks
dusty
hacks
and
carriages
were
ranged
and
others
were
driving
up
to
let
people
dismount
at
the
entrances
to
the
college
yard
within
the
temporary
secluding
a
part
of
the
grounds
for
the
students
and
their
friends
were
seen
stretching
from
dormitory
to
dormitory
long
lines
of
chinese
lanterns
to
be
lit
after
nightfall
swung
between
the
elms
groups
of
ladies
came
and
went
nearly
always
under
the
escort
of
some
student
the
caterers
carts
disburdened
of
their
and
salads
were
withdrawn
under
the
shade
in
the
street
and
their
drivers
lounged
or
drowsed
upon
the
seats
now
and
then
a
black
waiter
brilliant
as
a
bobolink
in
his
white
jacket
and
apron
appeared
on
some
errand
the
large
mild
cambridge
policemen
kept
the
entrances
to
the
yard
with
a
benevolent
vigilance
which
was
not
harsh
with
the
little
irish
children
coming
up
from
the
marsh
in
their
best
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
other
people
pleasure
is
it
a
perfect
class
day
cried
young
mavering
as
he
crossed
kirkland
street
with
miss
pasmer
and
glanced
down
its
vaulted
perspective
of
elms
through
which
the
sunlight
broke
and
lay
in
the
road
in
pools
and
washes
as
far
as
the
eye
reached
did
you
ever
see
anything
bluer
than
the
sky
i
feel
as
if
we
ordered
the
weather
with
the
rest
of
the
things
and
i
had
some
credit
for
it
as
host
do
make
it
a
little
compliment
miss
pasmer
i
assure
you
i
be
very
modest
about
ah
i
think
it
fully
up
to
the
occasion
said
the
girl
catching
the
spirit
of
his
amiable
satisfaction
is
it
the
usual
class
day
weather
you
spoil
everything
by
asking
that
cried
the
young
man
it
obliges
me
to
make
a
confession
it
always
good
weather
on
class
day
there
have
been
more
than
a
dozen
bad
class
days
in
the
century
but
admit
that
there
ca
have
been
a
better
class
day
than
this
oh
yes
it
certainly
the
pleasantest
class
day
i
seen
said
the
girl
and
now
when
mavering
laughed
she
laughed
too
thank
you
so
much
for
saying
that
i
hope
it
will
pass
off
in
unclouded
brilliancy
it
will
if
i
can
make
it
why
hallo
they
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
yet
and
looking
about
as
if
they
were
he
pulled
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
waved
it
at
the
others
of
their
party
they
caught
sight
of
it
and
came
hurrying
over
through
the
dust
saintsbury
said
apparently
as
the
sum
of
her
consultations
with
pasmer
the
tree
is
to
be
at
five
and
after
we
seen
a
few
spreads
i
going
to
take
the
ladies
hone
for
a
little
oh
no
do
do
that
pleaded
the
young
man
after
making
this
protest
he
seemed
not
to
have
anything
to
say
immediately
in
support
of
it
he
merely
added
this
is
miss
pasmer
first
class
day
and
i
want
her
to
see
it
but
you
have
to
leave
us
very
soon
to
get
yourself
ready
for
the
tree
suggested
the
professor
lady
with
a
motherly
prevision
i
shall
want
just
fifteen
minutes
for
i
know
better
mavering
said
saintsbury
with
finality
you
will
want
a
good
of
an
hour
to
make
yourself
as
disreputable
as
you
look
at
the
tree
and
you
have
to
take
time
for
counsel
and
meditation
you
may
stay
with
us
just
half
an
hour
and
then
we
shall
part
inexorably
i
seen
a
great
many
more
class
days
than
you
have
and
i
know
what
they
are
in
their
demands
upon
the
oh
well
then
we
wo
think
about
the
time
said
the
young
man
starting
on
with
miss
pasmer
well
do
undertake
too
much
said
the
lady
she
came
last
in
the
little
procession
with
the
elder
mavering
and
her
husband
and
mrs
pasmer
preceded
her
what
young
mavering
called
back
with
his
smiling
face
over
his
shoulder
she
says
not
to
bite
off
more
than
you
can
chew
the
professor
answered
for
her
mavering
broke
into
a
conscious
laugh
but
full
of
delight
and
with
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
had
almost
missed
the
greeting
of
some
ladies
who
bowed
to
him
he
had
to
turn
round
to
acknowledge
it
and
he
was
saluting
and
returning
salutations
pretty
well
all
along
the
line
of
their
progress
i
afraid
you
think
i
everybody
friend
but
my
own
miss
pasmer
but
i
assure
you
all
this
is
purely
accidental
i
do
know
so
many
people
after
all
only
all
that
i
do
know
seem
to
be
here
this
i
do
think
it
a
thing
to
be
sorry
for
said
the
girl
i
wish
we
knew
more
people
it
rather
forlorn
oh
will
you
let
me
introduce
some
of
the
fellows
to
you
they
be
so
if
you
tell
them
how
forlorn
i
said
i
was
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
oh
no
no
no
i
understand
that
and
i
assure
you
that
i
suppose
but
of
course
he
arrested
himself
in
the
superfluous
reassurance
he
was
offering
all
that
goes
without
saying
only
there
are
some
of
the
fellows
coming
back
to
the
law
school
and
if
allow
me
we
shall
be
very
happy
indeed
mavering
said
pasmer
behind
him
oh
thank
you
ever
so
much
this
was
occasion
for
another
burst
of
laughter
with
him
he
seemed
filled
with
the
intoxication
of
youth
whose
spirit
was
in
the
bright
air
of
the
day
and
radiant
in
the
young
faces
everywhere
the
paths
intersecting
one
another
between
the
different
dormitories
under
the
drooping
elms
were
thronged
with
people
coming
and
going
in
pairs
and
groups
and
the
academic
fete
the
prettiest
flower
of
our
tough
old
puritan
stem
had
that
charm
at
once
sylvan
and
elegant
which
enraptures
in
the
pictured
fables
of
the
renaissance
it
falls
at
that
moment
of
the
year
when
the
old
university
town
often
so
commonplace
and
sometimes
so
ugly
becomes
briefly
and
almost
pathetically
beautiful
under
the
leafage
of
her
hovering
elms
and
in
the
perfume
of
her
syringas
and
bathed
in
this
joyful
tide
of
youth
that
overflows
her
heart
she
seems
fit
then
to
be
the
home
of
the
poets
who
have
loved
her
and
sung
her
and
the
regret
of
any
friend
of
the
humanities
who
has
left
her
alice
said
pasmer
leaning
forward
a
little
to
speak
to
her
daughter
and
ignoring
a
remark
of
the
professor
did
you
ever
see
so
many
pretty
costumes
never
said
the
girl
with
equal
intensity
well
it
makes
you
feel
that
you
have
got
a
country
after
all
sighed
pasmer
in
a
sort
of
apostrophe
to
her
european
self
you
see
splendid
dressing
abroad
but
it
mostly
upon
old
people
who
ought
to
be
sick
and
ashamed
of
their
pomps
and
vanities
but
here
it
the
young
girls
who
dress
and
how
lovely
they
are
i
thought
they
were
charming
in
the
gymnasium
but
i
see
you
must
get
them
to
have
the
full
effect
mavering
are
they
always
so
prettily
dressed
on
class
day
well
i
beginning
to
feel
as
if
it
would
be
exactly
modest
for
me
to
say
so
whatever
i
think
you
better
ask
saintsbury
she
pretends
to
know
all
about
no
i
bound
to
say
they
not
said
the
professor
wife
candidly
your
daughter
she
added
in
a
low
tone
for
all
to
hear
decides
that
i
so
glad
you
said
that
saintsbury
said
the
young
man
he
looked
at
the
girl
who
blushed
with
a
pleasure
that
seemed
to
thrill
to
the
last
fibre
of
her
pretty
costume
she
could
not
say
anything
but
her
mother
asked
with
an
effort
at
do
you
think
so
really
it
one
of
those
london
things
they
have
so
much
taste
there
now
she
added
yielding
to
her
own
pride
in
the
dress
yes
i
supposed
it
must
be
said
saintsbury
we
used
to
come
in
muslins
and
tremendous
hoops
do
you
remember
did
you
look
like
your
photographs
asked
young
mavering
over
his
shoulder
yes
but
we
did
know
it
then
said
the
professor
wife
neither
did
we
said
the
professor
we
supposed
that
there
had
never
been
anything
equal
to
those
hoops
and
white
thank
you
my
dear
said
his
wife
tapping
him
between
the
shoulders
with
her
fan
now
do
go
any
do
you
mean
about
our
first
meeting
here
on
class
day
asked
her
husband
they
think
so
now
said
saintsbury
patiently
with
a
playful
threat
of
consequences
in
her
tone
when
i
first
saw
the
present
saintsbury
pursued
the
professor
it
was
his
joking
way
of
describing
her
as
if
there
had
been
several
other
saintsburys
she
was
dancing
on
the
green
ah
they
do
dance
on
the
green
any
more
i
hear
sighed
pasmer
no
they
do
said
the
other
lady
and
i
think
it
just
as
well
it
was
always
a
ridiculous
affectation
of
it
must
have
been
rather
public
said
young
mavering
in
a
low
voice
to
miss
pasmer
it
does
seem
as
if
it
could
ever
have
been
in
character
quite
she
answered
we
a
thoroughly
indoors
people
said
the
professor
and
it
seems
as
if
we
had
really
begun
to
get
well
as
a
race
till
we
had
come
in
out
of
the
how
can
you
say
that
on
a
day
like
this
cried
pasmer
i
suppose
any
one
could
be
so
do
flatter
him
cried
his
wife
does
he
consider
that
a
compliment
not
personally
he
answered
but
it
the
first
duty
of
a
professor
of
comparative
literature
to
be
i
do
understand
faltered
pasmer
he
will
be
happy
to
explain
at
the
greatest
possible
length
said
saintsbury
but
you
sha
spoil
our
pleasure
now
they
all
laughed
and
the
professor
looked
proud
of
the
wit
at
his
expense
the
american
husband
is
so
and
the
public
attitude
of
the
american
husband
and
wife
toward
each
other
is
apt
to
be
amiably
satirical
their
relation
seems
never
to
have
lost
its
novelty
or
to
lack
droll
and
surprising
contrasts
for
them
besides
these
passages
with
her
husband
saintsbury
kept
up
a
full
flow
of
talk
with
the
elder
mavering
which
pasmer
did
her
best
to
overhear
for
it
related
largely
to
his
son
whom
it
seemed
from
the
father
expressions
the
saintsburys
had
been
especially
kind
to
no
i
assure
you
pasmer
heard
her
protest
mr
saintsbury
has
been
very
much
interested
in
him
i
hope
he
has
not
put
any
troublesome
ideas
into
his
head
of
course
he
very
much
interested
in
literature
from
his
point
of
view
and
he
glad
to
find
any
of
the
young
men
interested
in
it
and
that
apt
to
make
him
overdo
matters
a
dan
wished
me
to
talk
with
him
and
i
shall
certainly
be
glad
to
do
so
said
the
father
but
in
a
tone
which
conveyed
to
pasmer
the
impression
that
though
he
was
always
open
to
conviction
his
mind
was
made
up
on
this
point
whatever
it
was
vi
the
party
went
to
half
a
dozen
spreads
some
of
which
were
on
a
scale
of
public
grandeur
approaching
that
of
the
gymnasium
and
others
of
a
subdued
elegance
befitting
the
more
private
hospitalities
in
the
students
rooms
pasmer
was
very
much
interested
in
these
rooms
whose
luxurious
appointments
testified
to
the
advance
of
riches
and
of
the
taste
to
apply
them
since
she
used
to
visit
students
rooms
in
class
days
the
deep
window
nooks
and
upholstered
in
the
leather
that
seems
sacred
alike
to
the
seats
and
the
shelves
of
libraries
the
aesthetic
bookcases
low
and
topped
with
the
etchings
and
prints
on
the
walls
which
the
elder
mavering
went
up
to
look
at
with
a
mystifying
air
of
understanding
such
things
the
foils
crossed
over
the
chimney
and
the
mantel
with
its
pipes
and
its
photographs
of
theatrical
celebrities
tilted
about
over
it
spoke
of
conditions
mostly
foreign
to
pasmer
memories
of
harvard
the
photographed
celebrities
seemed
to
be
chosen
chiefly
for
their
beauty
and
for
as
much
of
their
beauty
as
possible
pasmer
perceived
with
an
obscure
misgiving
of
the
sort
which
an
older
generation
always
likes
to
feel
concerning
the
younger
but
with
a
tolerance
too
which
was
personal
to
herself
it
was
to
be
considered
that
the
massive
thought
and
honest
amiability
of
salvini
face
and
the
deep
and
spiritualized
power
of
booth
varied
the
effect
of
these
companies
of
posturing
nymphs
at
many
places
she
either
met
old
friends
with
whom
she
clamoured
over
the
wonder
of
their
encounter
there
or
was
made
acquainted
with
new
people
by
the
saintsburys
she
kept
a
mother
eye
on
her
daughter
to
whom
young
mavering
presented
everybody
within
hail
or
reach
and
whom
she
could
see
whenever
she
looked
at
her
a
radiant
centre
of
admiration
she
could
hear
her
talk
sometimes
and
she
said
to
herself
that
really
alice
was
coming
out
she
had
never
heard
her
say
so
many
good
things
before
she
did
not
know
it
was
in
her
she
was
very
glad
then
that
she
had
let
her
wear
that
dress
it
was
certainly
distinguished
and
the
girl
carried
it
off
to
her
mother
amusement
with
the
air
of
a
superb
lady
of
the
period
from
which
it
dated
she
thought
what
a
simple
child
alice
really
was
all
the
time
those
other
children
the
seniors
were
stealing
their
glances
of
bold
or
timid
worship
at
her
and
doubtless
thinking
her
a
brilliant
woman
of
the
world
but
there
could
be
no
mistake
that
she
was
a
success
part
of
her
triumph
was
of
course
due
to
saintsbury
whose
chaperonage
pasmer
could
see
was
everywhere
of
effect
but
it
was
also
largely
due
to
the
vigilant
politeness
of
young
mavering
who
seemed
bent
on
making
her
have
good
time
and
who
let
no
chance
slip
him
pasmer
felt
his
kindness
truly
and
she
did
not
feel
it
the
less
because
she
knew
that
there
was
but
one
thing
that
could
at
his
frankly
selfish
age
make
a
young
fellow
wish
to
make
a
girl
have
a
good
time
except
for
that
reason
he
must
be
bending
the
whole
soul
of
egotistic
youth
to
making
some
other
girl
have
a
good
time
but
all
the
same
it
gave
her
pause
when
some
one
to
whom
she
was
introduced
spoke
to
her
of
her
friends
the
maverings
as
if
they
were
friends
of
the
oldest
standing
instead
of
acquaintances
of
very
recent
accident
she
did
not
think
of
disclaiming
the
intimacy
but
really
i
shall
die
of
these
maverings
she
said
to
herself
unless
i
find
out
something
about
them
pretty
i
not
going
to
take
you
to
the
omicron
spread
pasmer
said
young
mavering
coming
up
to
her
with
such
an
effect
of
sympathetic
devotion
that
she
had
to
ask
herself
are
they
my
friends
the
maverings
the
saintsburys
have
been
there
already
and
it
is
a
little
too
the
tone
of
superiority
gave
pasmer
courage
good
fellows
and
all
that
but
i
want
you
to
see
the
best
i
suppose
it
will
get
back
to
giving
the
spreads
all
in
the
fellows
rooms
again
it
a
good
deal
pleasanter
do
you
think
oh
yes
indeed
assented
pasmer
though
she
had
really
been
thinking
the
private
spreads
were
not
nearly
so
amusing
as
the
large
spread
she
had
seen
at
the
gymnasium
she
had
also
wondered
where
all
mavering
relations
and
friends
were
and
the
people
who
had
social
claims
on
him
that
he
could
be
giving
up
his
class
day
in
this
reckless
fashion
to
strangers
alice
would
account
for
a
good
deal
but
she
would
not
account
for
everything
pasmer
would
have
been
willing
to
take
him
from
others
but
if
he
were
so
anomalous
as
to
have
no
one
to
be
taken
from
of
course
it
lessened
his
value
as
a
trophy
these
things
went
in
and
out
of
her
mind
with
a
final
resolution
to
get
a
full
explanation
from
saintsbury
while
she
stood
and
smiled
her
winning
assent
up
into
the
young
man
handsome
face
saintsbury
caught
sight
of
them
and
as
if
suddenly
reminded
of
a
forgotten
duty
rushed
vividly
upon
him
mr
mavering
i
shall
not
let
you
stay
with
us
another
minute
you
must
go
to
your
room
now
and
get
ready
you
ought
to
have
a
little
he
broke
out
in
his
laugh
do
you
think
i
want
to
go
and
lie
down
awhile
like
a
lady
before
a
party
i
sure
you
be
the
stronger
for
it
said
saintsbury
but
go
upon
any
theory
do
you
see
there
is
a
senior
left
he
would
not
look
round
they
gone
to
other
spreads
he
said
but
now
i
tell
you
it
is
pretty
near
time
and
if
you
take
me
to
my
room
i
you
a
spoiled
boy
said
saintsbury
but
i
want
pasmer
to
see
the
room
of
a
real
student
a
reading
man
and
all
that
and
we
come
to
humour
well
come
upon
any
theory
said
young
mavering
his
father
and
professor
saintsbury
who
had
been
instructed
by
his
wife
not
to
lose
sight
of
her
were
at
hand
and
they
crossed
to
that
old
hall
which
keeps
its
favour
with
the
students
in
spite
of
the
rivalry
of
the
newer
dormitories
it
would
be
hard
to
say
why
pasmer
willingly
assented
to
its
being
much
better
out
of
pure
complaisance
though
the
ceilings
were
low
and
the
windows
small
and
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
the
franklin
stove
and
the
aesthetic
papering
and
painting
of
young
mavering
room
brought
it
up
to
the
level
of
those
others
that
she
had
seen
but
with
her
habit
of
saying
some
friendly
lying
thing
no
matter
what
her
impressions
were
she
exclaimed
oh
how
cosy
and
glad
of
the
word
she
went
about
from
one
to
another
asking
is
this
cosy
saintsbury
said
it
supposed
to
be
the
cell
of
a
recluse
but
it
is
cosy
it
looks
as
if
some
hermit
had
been
using
it
as
a
said
her
husband
for
there
were
odds
and
ends
of
furniture
and
clothes
and
boxes
and
handbags
scattered
about
the
floor
i
forgot
all
about
them
when
i
asked
you
cried
mavering
laughing
out
his
delight
they
belong
to
some
fellows
that
are
giving
spreads
in
their
rooms
and
i
let
them
put
them
in
do
you
commonly
let
people
put
things
in
your
room
that
they
want
to
get
rid
off
asked
pasmer
well
not
when
i
expecting
he
could
refuse
even
then
if
they
pressed
the
matter
said
saintsbury
lecturing
upon
him
to
her
friend
i
afraid
you
too
amiable
altogether
mavering
i
sure
you
let
people
impose
upon
you
said
the
other
lady
you
have
been
letting
us
impose
upon
ah
now
that
proves
you
all
wrong
it
proves
that
you
know
how
to
say
things
very
oh
thank
you
i
know
when
i
having
a
good
time
and
i
do
my
best
to
enjoy
he
ended
with
the
nervous
laugh
which
seemed
habitual
with
him
he
does
laugh
a
good
deal
thought
pasmer
surveying
him
with
smiling
steadiness
i
suppose
it
tires
alice
some
of
his
teeth
are
filled
at
the
sides
that
vein
in
his
forehead
they
say
that
means
she
said
to
him
i
hope
you
know
when
others
are
having
a
good
time
too
mavering
you
ought
to
have
that
they
both
looked
at
alice
oh
i
should
be
so
happy
to
think
you
been
bored
with
it
all
pasmer
he
returned
feeling
alice
was
looking
at
one
of
the
sketches
which
were
pretty
plentifully
pinned
about
the
wall
and
apparently
seeing
it
and
apparently
listening
to
what
professor
saintsbury
was
saying
but
her
mother
believed
from
a
tremor
of
the
ribbons
on
her
hat
that
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
young
mavering
gaze
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
we
been
delighted
simply
enchanted
said
pasmer
and
she
thought
now
if
alice
were
to
turn
round
just
as
she
stands
he
could
see
all
the
best
points
of
her
face
i
wonder
what
she
really
thinks
of
him
what
is
it
you
have
there
alice
she
asked
aloud
the
girl
turned
her
face
over
her
shoulder
so
exactly
in
the
way
her
mother
wished
that
pasmer
could
scarcely
repress
a
cry
of
joy
a
sketch
of
oh
how
very
interesting
said
pasmer
do
you
sketch
mavering
but
of
she
pressed
forward
and
studied
the
sketch
inattentively
how
very
very
good
she
buzzed
deep
in
her
throat
while
with
a
glance
at
her
daughter
she
thought
how
impassive
alice
is
but
she
behaves
with
great
dignity
yes
perhaps
that
best
and
are
you
going
to
be
an
artist
she
asked
of
mavering
not
if
it
can
be
prevented
he
answered
laughing
again
but
his
laugh
is
very
pleasant
reflected
pasmer
does
alice
dislike
it
so
much
she
repeated
aloud
if
it
can
be
prevented
they
think
i
might
spoil
a
great
lawyer
in
the
oh
i
see
and
are
you
going
to
be
a
lawyer
but
to
be
a
great
painter
and
america
has
so
few
of
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
talking
nonsense
but
she
was
aware
through
her
own
indifference
to
the
topic
that
he
was
not
minding
what
she
said
but
was
trying
to
bring
himself
into
talk
with
alice
again
the
girl
persistently
listened
to
professor
saintsbury
is
she
punishing
him
for
something
her
mother
asked
herself
what
can
it
be
for
does
she
think
he
a
little
too
pushing
perhaps
he
is
a
little
she
reflected
with
an
inward
sigh
that
she
would
know
whether
he
was
if
she
only
knew
more
about
him
he
did
the
honours
of
his
room
very
simply
and
nicely
and
he
said
it
was
pretty
rough
to
think
this
was
the
last
of
it
after
which
he
faltered
and
something
occurred
to
mrs
saintsbury
why
we
keeping
you
it
time
for
you
to
dress
for
the
tree
john
she
reproached
her
husband
how
could
you
let
us
do
it
far
be
it
from
me
to
hurry
ladies
out
of
other
houses
especially
ladies
who
have
put
themselves
in
charge
of
other
no
do
hurry
pleaded
mavering
there
plenty
of
how
much
time
asked
saintsbury
he
looked
at
his
watch
well
a
good
quarter
of
an
and
i
was
to
have
taken
pasmer
and
alice
home
for
a
little
rest
before
the
tree
cried
mrs
saintsbury
and
now
we
must
go
at
once
or
we
shall
get
no
sort
of
in
the
civil
and
satirical
parley
which
followed
no
one
answered
another
but
young
mavering
bore
as
full
a
part
as
the
elder
ladies
and
only
his
father
and
alice
were
silent
his
guests
got
themselves
out
of
his
room
they
met
at
the
threshold
a
young
fellow
short
and
dark
and
stout
in
an
old
tennis
suit
he
fell
back
at
sight
of
them
and
took
off
his
hat
to
saintsbury
why
boardman
do
be
bashful
boardman
young
mavering
called
out
come
in
and
show
them
how
i
shall
look
in
five
boardman
took
his
introductions
with
a
sort
of
and
then
said
you
have
to
look
it
in
less
than
five
minutes
now
mavering
you
come
what
are
they
ready
we
must
fly
panted
saintsbury
without
waiting
for
the
answer
which
was
lost
in
the
incoherencies
of
all
sorts
of
au
revoirs
called
after
and
called
back
vii
that
is
one
thing
said
saintsbury
looking
swiftly
round
to
see
that
the
elder
mavering
was
not
within
hearing
as
she
hurried
ahead
with
pasmer
that
i
ca
stand
in
dan
mavering
why
could
he
have
warned
us
that
it
was
getting
near
the
time
why
should
he
have
gone
on
pretending
that
there
was
no
hurry
it
is
insincerity
exactly
but
it
is
candour
no
it
uncandid
oh
i
suppose
it
the
artistic
temperament
never
coming
straight
to
the
what
do
you
mean
asked
pasmer
eagerly
i
tell
you
she
looked
round
and
halted
a
little
for
alice
who
was
walking
detached
and
neglected
by
the
preoccupation
of
the
two
elderly
men
i
afraid
you
tired
she
said
to
the
girl
oh
of
course
not
on
class
day
but
i
hope
we
shall
get
seats
what
weather
the
sun
had
not
been
oppressive
at
any
time
during
the
day
though
the
crowded
building
had
been
close
and
warm
and
now
it
lay
like
a
painted
light
on
the
grass
and
paths
over
which
they
passed
to
the
entrance
of
the
grounds
around
the
tree
holden
chapel
which
enclosed
the
space
on
the
right
as
they
went
in
shed
back
the
sun
from
its
flank
rising
unrelieved
in
its
venerable
ugliness
by
any
touch
of
the
festive
preparations
but
to
their
left
and
diagonally
across
from
them
high
stagings
supported
tiers
of
seats
along
the
equally
unlovely
red
bulks
of
hollis
and
of
harvard
these
seats
and
the
windows
in
the
stories
above
them
were
densely
packed
with
people
mostly
young
girls
dressed
in
a
thousand
enchanting
shades
and
colours
and
bonneted
and
hatted
to
the
last
effect
of
fashion
they
were
like
vast
terraces
of
flowers
to
the
swift
glance
and
here
and
there
some
brilliant
parasol
spread
to
catch
the
sun
on
the
higher
ranks
was
like
a
flaunting
poppy
rising
to
the
light
and
lolling
out
above
the
blooms
of
lower
stature
but
the
parasols
were
few
for
the
two
halls
flung
wide
curtains
of
shade
over
the
greater
part
of
the
spectators
and
across
to
the
foot
of
the
chapel
while
a
piece
of
the
carpentry
whose
simplicity
seems
part
of
the
class
day
tradition
shut
out
the
glare
and
the
uninvited
public
striving
to
penetrate
the
enclosure
next
the
street
in
front
of
this
yellow
pine
wall
with
its
ranks
of
benches
stood
the
class
day
tree
girded
at
ten
or
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
with
a
wide
band
of
flowers
pasmer
and
her
friends
found
themselves
so
late
that
if
some
gentlemen
who
knew
professor
saintsbury
had
not
given
up
their
places
they
could
have
got
no
seats
but
this
happened
and
the
three
ladies
had
harmoniously
blended
their
hues
with
those
of
the
others
in
that
bank
of
bloom
and
the
gentlemen
had
somehow
made
away
with
their
obstructiveness
in
different
crouching
and
stooping
postures
at
their
feet
when
the
junior
class
filed
into
the
green
enclosure
amidst
the
of
their
friends
and
sank
in
long
ranks
on
the
grass
beside
the
chapel
then
the
sophomores
appeared
and
were
received
with
cheers
by
the
juniors
with
whom
they
joined
as
soon
as
they
were
placed
in
heaping
ignominy
upon
the
freshmen
the
seniors
came
last
grotesque
in
the
variety
of
their
old
clothes
and
a
fierce
uproar
of
and
yells
met
them
from
the
students
squatted
upon
the
grass
as
they
loosely
grouped
themselves
in
front
of
the
tree
the
men
of
the
younger
classes
formed
in
three
rings
and
began
circling
in
different
directions
around
them
pasmer
bent
across
saintsbury
to
her
daughter
can
you
make
out
mavering
among
them
alice
no
hush
mamma
pleaded
the
girl
with
the
subsidence
of
the
tumult
in
the
other
classes
the
seniors
had
broken
from
the
stoical
silence
they
kept
through
it
and
were
now
with
an
equally
serious
clamour
applauding
the
first
of
a
long
list
of
personages
beginning
with
the
president
and
ranging
through
their
favourites
in
the
faculty
down
to
billy
the
postman
the
leader
who
invited
them
to
this
expression
of
good
feeling
exacted
the
full
tale
of
nine
cheers
for
each
person
he
named
and
before
he
reached
the
last
the
came
in
gasps
from
their
dry
throats
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
the
marshal
flung
his
hat
at
the
elm
then
the
rush
upon
the
tree
took
place
and
the
scramble
for
the
flowers
the
first
who
swarmed
up
the
trunk
were
promptly
plucked
down
by
the
legs
and
flung
upon
the
ground
as
if
to
form
a
base
there
for
the
operations
of
the
rest
who
surged
and
built
themselves
up
around
the
elm
in
an
irregular
mass
from
time
to
time
some
one
appeared
clambering
over
heads
and
shoulders
to
make
a
desperate
lunge
and
snatch
at
the
flowers
and
then
fall
back
into
the
fluctuant
heap
again
yells
cries
and
clappings
of
hands
came
from
the
other
students
and
the
spectators
in
the
seats
involuntarily
dying
away
almost
to
silence
as
some
stronger
or
wilfuler
aspirant
held
his
own
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
others
or
was
stayed
there
by
his
friends
among
them
till
he
could
make
sure
of
a
handful
of
the
flowers
a
rush
was
made
upon
him
when
he
reached
the
ground
if
he
could
keep
his
flowers
from
the
hands
that
snatched
at
them
he
staggered
away
with
the
fragments
the
wreath
began
to
show
wide
patches
of
the
bark
under
it
the
surging
and
struggling
crowd
below
grew
less
dense
here
and
there
one
struggled
out
of
it
and
walked
slowly
about
panting
pitiably
oh
i
wonder
they
do
kill
each
other
cried
pasmer
is
it
terrible
she
would
not
have
missed
it
on
any
account
but
she
liked
to
get
all
she
could
out
of
her
emotions
they
never
get
hurt
said
saintsbury
oh
look
there
dan
mavering
the
crowd
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
had
closed
densely
and
a
wilder
roar
went
up
from
all
the
students
a
tall
slim
young
fellow
lifted
on
the
shoulders
of
the
mass
below
and
staying
himself
with
one
hand
against
the
tree
rapidly
stripped
away
the
remnants
of
the
wreath
and
flung
them
into
the
crowd
under
him
a
single
tuft
remained
the
crowd
was
melting
away
under
him
in
a
scramble
for
the
fallen
flowers
he
made
a
crooked
leap
caught
the
tuft
and
tumbled
with
it
headlong
oh
breathed
the
ladies
on
the
benches
with
a
general
suspiration
lost
in
the
and
clappings
as
mavering
reappeared
with
the
bunch
of
flowers
in
his
hand
he
looked
dizzily
about
as
if
not
sure
of
his
course
then
his
face
flushed
and
heated
with
the
hair
pulled
over
the
eyes
brightened
with
recognition
and
he
advanced
upon
saintsbury
party
with
rapid
paces
each
of
which
pasmer
commentated
with
inward
conjecture
is
he
bringing
the
flowers
to
alice
is
it
altogether
too
conspicuous
has
he
really
the
right
to
do
it
what
will
people
think
will
he
give
them
to
me
for
her
or
will
he
hand
them
directly
to
her
which
should
i
prefer
him
to
do
i
wonder
if
i
know
when
she
looked
up
with
the
air
of
surprise
mixed
with
deprecation
and
ironical
disclaimer
which
she
had
prepared
while
these
things
were
passing
through
her
mind
young
mavering
had
reached
them
and
had
paused
in
a
moment
hesitation
before
his
father
with
a
bow
of
affectionate
burlesque
from
which
he
lifted
his
face
to
break
into
laughter
at
the
look
in
all
their
eyes
he
handed
the
tattered
nosegay
to
his
father
oh
how
delightful
how
delicate
how
perfect
pasmer
confided
to
herself
i
think
this
must
be
for
you
pasmer
said
the
elder
mavering
offering
her
the
bouquet
with
a
grave
smile
at
his
son
whim
oh
no
indeed
said
pasmer
for
saintsbury
of
she
gave
it
to
her
and
saintsbury
at
once
transferred
it
to
miss
pasmer
they
wished
me
to
pass
this
to
you
alice
and
at
this
consummation
dan
mavering
broke
into
another
happy
laugh
mrs
saintsbury
you
always
do
the
right
thing
at
once
he
cried
that
more
than
i
can
say
of
you
mavering
she
retorted
oh
thank
you
mavering
said
the
girl
receiving
the
flowers
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
too
intent
upon
them
and
him
to
have
noticed
the
little
comedy
that
had
conveyed
them
to
her
viii
as
soon
after
class
day
as
pasmer
complaisant
sense
of
the
decencies
would
let
her
she
went
out
from
boston
to
call
on
saintsbury
in
cambridge
and
thank
her
for
her
kindness
to
alice
and
herself
she
will
know
well
enough
what
i
come
for
she
said
to
herself
and
she
felt
it
the
more
important
to
ignore
penetration
by
every
polite
futility
this
was
due
to
them
both
and
she
did
not
go
till
the
second
day
after
saintsbury
came
down
into
the
darkened
library
to
find
her
and
give
her
a
fan
you
still
live
jenny
she
said
kissing
her
gaily
they
called
each
other
by
their
girl
names
as
is
rather
the
custom
in
boston
with
ladies
who
are
in
the
same
set
whether
they
are
great
friends
or
not
in
the
more
changeful
society
of
cambridge
where
so
many
new
people
are
constantly
coming
and
going
in
connection
with
the
college
it
is
not
so
much
the
custom
but
saintsbury
was
boston
born
as
well
as
pasmer
and
was
cantabrigian
by
marriage
though
this
is
not
saying
that
she
was
not
also
thoroughly
so
by
convincement
and
usage
she
now
rarely
went
into
boston
society
yes
etta
just
but
i
was
sure
of
it
said
pasmer
when
i
woke
yesterday
i
was
a
mere
aching
jelly
and
alice
oh
i
do
think
she
had
any
physical
consciousness
she
was
a
mere
rapturous
memory
she
did
have
a
good
time
did
she
said
saintsbury
in
a
generous
retrospect
i
think
she
was
on
her
feet
every
moment
in
the
evening
it
kept
me
from
getting
tired
to
watch
i
was
afraid
you
be
quite
worn
out
i
no
idea
it
was
so
late
it
must
have
been
nearly
half
past
seven
before
we
got
away
from
the
beck
hall
spread
and
then
by
the
time
we
had
walked
round
the
college
grounds
how
extremely
pretty
the
lanterns
were
and
how
charming
the
whole
effect
was
it
must
have
been
nine
before
the
dancing
began
well
we
owe
it
all
to
you
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
owing
i
always
glad
of
an
excuse
for
class
day
and
it
was
dan
mavering
who
really
managed
the
he
was
very
kind
said
pasmer
with
a
feeling
which
was
chiefly
gratitude
to
her
friend
for
bringing
in
his
name
so
soon
now
that
it
had
been
spoken
she
felt
it
decorous
to
throw
aside
the
outer
integument
of
pretense
which
if
it
could
have
been
entirely
exfoliated
would
have
caused
pasmer
morally
to
disappear
like
an
onion
stripped
of
its
successive
laminae
what
did
you
mean
she
asked
leaning
forward
with
her
face
averted
about
his
having
the
artistic
temperament
is
he
going
to
be
an
artist
i
should
hope
she
remembered
without
shame
that
she
had
strongly
urged
him
to
consider
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
be
a
painter
than
a
lawyer
in
the
dearth
of
great
american
painters
he
could
be
a
painter
if
he
liked
up
to
a
certain
point
said
saintsbury
or
he
could
be
any
one
of
other
things
his
last
craze
was
journalism
but
you
know
what
i
mean
by
the
artistic
temperament
it
that
inability
to
be
explicit
that
habit
of
leaving
things
vague
and
undefined
and
hoping
they
somehow
come
out
as
you
want
them
of
themselves
that
way
of
taking
the
line
of
beauty
to
get
at
what
you
wish
to
do
or
say
and
of
being
very
finicking
about
little
things
and
lag
about
essentials
that
what
i
mean
by
the
artistic
yes
that
terrible
sighed
pasmer
with
the
abstractly
severe
yet
personally
pitying
perception
of
one
whose
every
word
and
act
was
sincere
and
direct
i
know
just
what
you
mean
but
how
does
it
apply
to
mavering
it
does
exactly
returned
her
friend
and
i
always
ashamed
when
i
say
or
even
think
anything
against
dan
mavering
he
sweetness
itself
we
known
him
ever
since
he
came
to
harvard
and
i
must
say
that
a
more
constant
and
lovely
follow
i
never
saw
it
was
merely
when
he
was
a
freshman
and
he
had
that
home
feeling
hanging
about
him
still
that
makes
all
the
freshmen
so
appreciative
of
anything
you
do
for
them
but
all
through
the
sophomore
and
junior
years
when
they
so
taken
up
with
their
athletics
and
their
societies
and
their
college
life
generally
that
they
have
a
moment
for
people
that
have
been
kind
to
them
he
was
just
as
faithful
as
how
nice
cried
pasmer
yes
indeed
and
all
the
allurements
of
boston
society
have
taken
him
from
us
altogether
you
ca
imagine
how
much
this
means
till
you
been
at
home
a
while
and
seen
how
the
students
are
petted
and
spoiled
nowadays
in
the
young
oh
i
heard
of
it
said
pasmer
and
is
it
his
versatility
and
brilliancy
or
his
amiability
that
makes
him
such
a
universal
favourite
universal
favourite
i
do
know
that
he
well
popular
oh
he
certainly
very
much
liked
but
jenny
there
are
no
universal
favourites
in
harvard
now
if
there
ever
were
the
classes
are
altogether
too
big
and
it
would
be
ability
and
it
would
be
amiability
alone
that
would
give
a
man
any
sort
of
what
in
the
world
would
it
be
that
question
more
than
anything
else
shows
how
long
you
been
away
jenny
it
would
be
family
family
with
a
judicious
mixture
of
the
others
and
with
is
it
possible
but
of
course
i
remember
only
at
their
age
one
thinks
of
students
as
being
all
with
each
other
yes
it
hard
to
realise
how
conventional
they
are
how
very
much
worldlier
than
the
world
till
one
sees
it
as
one
does
in
cambridge
they
pique
themselves
on
it
and
saintsbury
she
was
one
of
those
women
whom
everything
reminds
of
their
husbands
says
that
it
is
a
bad
thing
altogether
he
says
that
harvard
is
just
like
the
world
and
even
if
it
a
little
more
so
these
boys
have
got
to
live
in
the
world
and
they
had
better
know
what
it
is
you
may
not
approve
of
the
harvard
spirit
and
saintsbury
does
sympathise
with
it
he
only
says
the
world
spirit
harvard
men
the
swells
are
far
more
exclusive
than
oxford
men
a
student
il
faut
would
at
all
like
to
be
supposed
to
know
another
student
whom
we
valued
for
his
brilliancy
unless
he
was
popular
and
well
known
in
dear
me
cried
pasmer
but
of
course
it
perfectly
natural
with
young
people
and
it
well
enough
that
they
should
begin
to
understand
how
things
really
are
in
the
world
early
it
will
save
them
from
a
great
many
i
assure
you
we
have
very
little
to
teach
harvard
men
in
those
matters
they
could
give
any
of
us
points
those
who
are
of
good
family
and
station
know
how
to
protect
themselves
by
reserves
that
the
others
would
dare
to
transgress
but
a
merely
rich
man
could
rise
in
their
set
any
more
than
a
merely
gifted
man
he
could
get
on
to
a
certain
point
by
toadying
and
some
do
but
he
would
never
get
to
be
popular
like
dan
and
what
makes
him
popular
to
go
back
to
the
point
we
started
from
said
pasmer
ah
that
hard
to
say
it
quality
i
suppose
i
do
mean
social
quality
exactly
but
personal
charm
he
never
had
a
mean
thought
of
course
we
all
full
of
mean
thoughts
and
dan
is
too
but
his
first
impulse
is
always
generous
and
sweet
and
at
his
age
people
act
a
great
deal
from
impulse
i
do
suppose
he
ever
met
a
human
being
without
wanting
to
make
him
like
him
and
trying
to
do
yes
he
certainly
makes
you
like
him
sighed
pasmer
but
i
understand
that
he
ca
make
people
like
him
without
family
or
money
and
i
do
understand
that
he
one
of
those
riches
who
are
giving
harvard
such
a
reputation
for
extravagance
there
was
an
inquiring
note
in
pasmer
voice
and
in
the
obscurity
which
protected
the
ladies
from
the
expression
of
each
other
faces
saintsbury
gave
a
little
laugh
of
intelligence
to
which
pasmer
responded
by
a
murmur
of
humorous
enjoyment
at
being
understood
oh
no
he
is
one
of
those
but
the
maverings
have
plenty
of
money
said
saintsbury
and
dan
been
very
free
with
it
though
not
lavish
and
he
came
here
with
a
reputation
for
popularity
from
a
very
good
school
and
that
always
goes
a
very
great
way
in
yes
said
pasmer
feeling
herself
getting
hopelessly
adrift
in
these
unknown
waters
but
reposing
a
pious
confidence
in
her
pilot
yes
if
a
sufficient
number
of
his
class
said
he
was
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
he
would
be
pretty
sure
to
be
chosen
one
of
the
first
ten
in
the
what
mysteries
gasped
pasmer
disposed
to
make
fun
of
them
but
a
little
overawed
all
the
same
what
in
the
world
is
the
it
the
society
that
the
freshmen
are
the
most
eager
to
get
into
they
chosen
ten
at
a
time
by
the
old
members
and
to
be
one
of
the
first
ten
the
only
freshmen
chosen
is
something
quite
i
pasmer
fanned
herself
after
taking
a
long
breath
and
when
he
had
got
into
the
then
it
would
depend
upon
himself
how
he
spent
his
money
and
all
that
and
what
sort
of
society
success
he
was
in
boston
that
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
from
the
first
then
another
thing
is
caution
discreetness
not
saying
anything
censorious
or
critical
of
other
men
no
matter
what
they
do
and
dan
mavering
is
the
perfection
of
prudence
because
he
the
perfection
of
pasmer
had
apparently
got
all
of
these
facts
that
she
could
digest
and
who
are
the
maverings
why
it
an
old
boston
name
it
too
old
is
it
like
pasmer
there
are
no
maverings
in
boston
that
i
ever
heard
no
the
name
quite
died
out
just
here
i
believe
but
it
old
and
it
bids
fair
to
be
replated
at
ponkwasset
at
ponk
that
where
they
have
their
mills
or
factories
or
shops
or
whatever
institution
they
make
cried
pasmer
austerely
after
a
moment
she
asked
and
is
the
now
i
mean
she
tried
to
think
of
some
way
of
modifying
the
commonness
of
her
phrase
but
did
not
after
all
it
expressed
her
meaning
it
is
the
extreme
of
fashion
of
course
but
it
manufacturing
and
it
is
disgraceful
and
the
mavering
papers
are
very
pretty
and
you
can
live
with
them
without
becoming
anaemic
or
having
your
face
face
twitch
echoed
pasmer
yes
arsenical
oh
conscientious
as
well
as
aesthetic
i
see
and
does
mavering
put
his
artistic
temperament
into
them
his
father
does
he
a
very
interesting
man
he
has
the
best
taste
in
certain
things
he
knows
more
about
etchings
i
suppose
than
any
one
else
in
is
it
possible
and
does
he
live
at
ponkwasset
falls
it
in
rhode
island
is
it
new
hampshire
yes
the
whole
family
live
the
whole
family
are
there
many
of
them
i
fancied
somehow
that
mavering
was
the
only
do
tell
me
about
them
etta
said
pasmer
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
fanning
herself
with
an
effect
of
impartial
interest
to
which
the
dim
light
of
the
room
lent
itself
he
the
only
son
but
there
are
daughters
of
course
very
cultivated
and
is
he
is
the
elder
mavering
a
i
do
know
what
made
me
think
so
a
widower
well
no
not
not
exactly
he
not
a
i
hope
no
indeed
but
his
wife
a
helpless
invalid
and
always
has
been
he
perfectly
devoted
to
her
and
he
hurried
home
yesterday
though
he
wanted
very
much
to
stay
for
commencement
he
never
away
from
her
longer
than
he
can
help
she
bedridden
and
you
can
see
from
the
moment
you
enter
it
that
it
a
man
house
daughters
ca
change
that
you
have
you
been
there
asked
pasmer
surprised
that
she
was
getting
so
much
information
but
eager
for
more
why
how
long
have
you
known
them
etta
only
since
dan
came
to
harvard
saintsbury
took
a
fancy
to
him
from
the
start
and
the
boy
was
so
fond
of
him
that
they
were
always
insisting
upon
a
visit
and
last
summer
we
stopped
there
on
our
way
to
the
and
the
sisters
do
they
stay
there
the
whole
year
round
are
they
countrified
one
does
live
in
the
country
without
being
countrified
said
saintsbury
they
rather
quiet
girls
though
they
been
about
a
good
deal
to
europe
with
friends
and
to
new
york
in
the
winter
they
older
than
dan
they
more
like
their
father
are
you
afraid
of
that
draught
at
the
windows
oh
no
it
delicious
and
he
like
the
mother
then
it
the
father
who
has
the
artistic
taste
he
gets
that
from
him
and
the
mother
who
has
the
temperament
how
extremely
interesting
and
so
he
going
to
be
a
lawyer
why
lawyer
if
he
got
the
talent
and
the
temperament
of
an
artist
does
his
father
wish
him
to
be
a
lawyer
his
father
wishes
him
to
be
a
and
the
young
man
compromises
on
the
law
i
see
said
pasmer
and
you
say
he
been
going
into
boston
a
great
deal
where
does
he
go
the
ladies
entered
into
this
social
inquiry
with
a
zest
which
it
would
be
hard
to
make
the
reader
share
or
perhaps
to
feel
the
importance
of
it
is
enough
that
it
ended
in
the
social
vindication
of
dan
mavering
it
would
not
have
been
enough
for
mrs
pasmer
that
he
was
accepted
in
the
best
cambridge
houses
she
knew
of
old
how
people
were
accepted
in
cambridge
for
their
intellectual
brilliancy
or
solidity
their
personal
worth
and
all
sorts
of
things
without
consideration
of
the
mystical
something
which
gives
vogue
in
boston
how
superb
alice
was
saintsbury
broke
off
abruptly
she
has
such
a
beautiful
manner
such
repose
yes
said
her
mother
thoughtfully
but
she
very
intense
and
i
do
see
where
she
gets
it
her
father
has
repose
enough
but
he
has
no
intensity
and
i
all
intensity
and
no
repose
but
i
no
more
like
my
mother
than
alice
is
like
i
think
she
has
the
hibbins
face
said
saintsbury
oh
she
got
the
hibbins
face
said
mrs
pasmer
with
a
disdain
of
tone
which
she
did
not
at
all
feel
the
tone
was
mere
she
was
about
to
revert
to
the
question
of
mavering
family
when
the
rang
and
another
visitor
interrupted
her
talk
with
saintsbury
ix
pasmer
husband
looked
a
great
deal
older
than
herself
and
by
operation
of
a
law
of
compensation
he
was
lean
and
silent
while
she
was
plump
and
voluble
he
had
thick
eyebrows
which
remained
black
after
his
hair
and
beard
had
become
white
and
which
gave
him
an
aspect
of
fierceness
expressive
of
nothing
in
his
character
it
was
from
him
that
their
daughter
got
her
height
and
as
pasmer
freely
owned
her
distinction
soon
after
their
marriage
the
pasmers
had
gone
to
live
in
paris
where
they
remained
faithful
to
the
fortunes
of
the
second
empire
till
its
fall
with
intervals
of
return
to
their
own
country
of
a
year
or
two
years
at
a
time
after
the
fall
of
the
empire
they
made
their
sojourn
in
england
where
they
lived
upon
the
edges
and
surfaces
of
things
as
americans
must
in
europe
everywhere
but
had
more
permanency
of
feeling
than
they
had
known
in
france
and
something
like
a
real
social
status
at
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
they
might
end
their
days
there
but
that
which
makes
americans
different
from
all
other
peoples
and
which
finally
claims
their
allegiance
for
their
own
land
made
them
wish
to
come
back
to
america
and
to
come
back
to
boston
after
all
their
place
in
england
was
strictly
inferior
and
must
be
they
knew
titles
and
consorted
with
them
but
they
had
none
themselves
and
the
english
constancy
which
kept
their
friends
faithful
to
them
after
they
had
become
an
old
story
was
correlated
with
the
english
honesty
which
never
permitted
them
to
mistake
themselves
for
even
the
lowest
of
the
nobility
they
went
out
last
and
they
did
not
come
in
first
ever
the
invitations
upon
these
conditions
might
have
gone
on
indefinitely
but
they
did
not
imply
a
future
for
the
young
girl
in
whom
the
interests
of
her
parents
centred
after
being
so
long
a
little
girl
she
had
become
a
great
girl
and
then
all
at
once
she
had
become
a
young
lady
they
had
to
ask
themselves
the
mother
definitely
and
the
father
formlessly
whether
they
wished
their
daughter
to
marry
an
englishman
and
their
hearts
answered
them
like
true
republican
hearts
not
an
untitled
englishman
while
they
saw
no
prospect
of
her
getting
any
other
pasmer
philosophised
the
case
with
a
clearness
and
a
courage
which
gave
her
husband
a
series
of
twinges
analogous
to
the
toothache
for
a
man
naturally
shrinks
from
such
bold
realisations
she
said
alice
had
the
beauty
of
a
beauty
and
she
had
the
distinction
of
a
beauty
but
she
had
not
the
principles
of
a
beauty
there
was
no
use
pretending
that
she
had
for
this
reason
the
prince
of
wales
set
so
accessible
to
american
loveliness
with
the
courage
of
its
convictions
was
beyond
her
and
the
question
was
whether
there
was
money
enough
for
a
younger
son
or
whether
if
there
was
a
younger
son
was
worth
it
however
this
might
be
there
was
no
question
but
there
was
now
less
money
than
there
had
been
and
a
great
deal
less
the
investments
had
not
turned
out
as
they
promised
not
only
had
dividends
been
passed
but
there
had
been
permanent
shrinkages
what
was
once
an
amiable
competency
from
the
pooling
of
their
joint
resources
had
dwindled
to
a
sum
that
needed
a
careful
eye
both
to
the
income
and
the
outgo
alice
becoming
a
young
lady
had
increased
their
expenses
by
the
suddenly
mounting
cost
of
her
dresses
and
of
the
dresses
which
her
mother
must
now
buy
for
the
different
role
she
had
to
sustain
in
society
they
began
to
ask
themselves
what
it
was
for
and
to
question
whether
if
she
could
not
marry
a
noble
englishman
alice
had
not
better
marry
a
good
american
even
with
pasmer
this
question
was
tacit
and
it
need
not
be
explained
to
any
one
who
knows
our
life
that
in
her
most
worldly
dreams
she
intended
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
that
her
daughter
should
marry
for
love
it
is
the
rule
that
americans
marry
for
love
and
the
very
rare
exception
that
they
marry
for
anything
else
and
if
our
divorce
courts
are
so
busy
in
spite
of
this
fact
it
is
perhaps
because
the
americans
also
unmarry
for
love
or
perhaps
because
love
is
not
so
sufficient
in
matters
of
the
heart
as
has
been
represented
in
the
literature
of
people
who
have
not
been
able
to
give
it
so
fair
a
trial
but
whether
it
is
all
in
all
in
marriage
or
only
a
very
marked
essential
it
is
certain
that
pasmer
expected
her
marriage
to
involve
it
she
would
have
shrunk
from
intimating
anything
else
to
her
as
from
a
gross
indecency
and
she
could
not
possibly
by
any
finest
insinuation
have
made
her
a
partner
in
her
design
for
her
happiness
that
so
far
as
alice
was
concerned
was
a
thing
which
was
to
fall
to
her
as
from
heaven
for
this
also
is
part
of
the
american
plan
we
are
the
children
of
the
poets
the
devotees
of
the
romancers
so
far
as
that
goes
and
however
material
and
practical
we
are
in
other
things
in
this
we
are
a
republic
of
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
and
we
live
in
a
golden
age
which
if
it
sometimes
seems
an
age
of
inconvertible
paper
is
certainly
so
through
no
want
of
faith
in
us
though
the
pasmers
said
that
they
ought
to
go
home
for
alice
sake
they
both
understood
that
they
were
going
home
experimentally
and
not
with
the
intention
of
laying
their
bones
in
their
native
soil
unless
they
liked
it
or
found
they
could
afford
it
pasmer
had
no
illusions
in
regard
to
it
she
had
learned
from
her
former
visits
home
that
it
was
frightfully
expensive
and
during
the
fifteen
years
which
they
had
spent
chiefly
abroad
she
had
observed
the
decay
of
that
distinction
which
formerly
attended
returning
sojourners
from
europe
she
had
seen
them
cease
gradually
from
the
romantic
reverence
which
once
clothed
them
and
decline
through
a
gathering
indifference
into
something
like
slight
and
compassion
as
people
who
have
not
been
able
to
make
their
place
or
hold
their
own
at
home
and
she
had
taught
herself
so
well
how
to
pocket
the
superiority
natural
to
the
europeanised
american
before
arriving
at
consciousness
of
this
disesteem
that
she
paid
a
ready
tribute
to
people
who
had
always
stayed
at
home
in
fact
pasmer
was
a
flatterer
and
it
can
not
be
claimed
for
her
that
she
flattered
adroitly
always
but
adroitness
in
flattery
is
not
necessary
for
its
successful
use
there
is
no
morsel
of
it
too
gross
for
the
condor
gullet
and
the
ostrich
stomach
of
human
vanity
there
is
no
society
in
which
it
does
not
give
the
utterer
instant
honour
and
acceptance
in
greater
or
less
degree
pasmer
who
was
very
employed
it
because
she
liked
it
herself
and
knowing
how
absolutely
worthless
it
was
from
her
own
tongue
prized
it
from
others
she
could
have
rested
perfectly
safe
without
it
in
her
social
position
which
she
found
unchanged
by
years
of
absence
she
had
not
been
a
hibbins
for
nothing
and
she
was
not
a
pasmer
for
nothing
though
why
she
should
have
been
either
for
something
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
but
while
confessing
the
foibles
of
pasmer
it
would
not
be
fair
to
omit
from
the
tale
of
her
many
virtues
the
final
conscientiousness
of
her
openly
involuted
character
not
to
mention
other
things
she
instituted
and
practised
economies
as
alien
to
her
nature
as
to
her
husband
and
in
their
narrowing
affairs
she
kept
him
out
of
debt
she
was
prudent
she
was
alert
and
while
presenting
to
the
world
all
the
outward
effect
of
a
butterfly
she
possessed
some
of
the
best
qualities
of
the
bee
with
his
senatorial
presence
his
distinction
of
person
and
manner
pasmer
was
inveterately
selfish
in
that
province
of
small
personal
things
where
his
wife
left
him
unmolested
in
what
related
to
his
own
comfort
and
convenience
he
was
undisputed
lord
of
himself
it
was
she
who
ordered
their
comings
and
goings
and
decided
in
which
hemisphere
they
should
sojourn
from
time
to
time
and
in
what
city
street
and
house
but
always
with
the
understanding
that
the
kitchen
and
all
the
domestic
appointments
were
to
her
husband
mind
he
was
sensitive
to
degrees
of
heat
and
cold
and
luxurious
in
the
matter
of
lighting
and
he
had
a
fine
nose
for
plumbing
if
he
had
not
occupied
himself
so
much
with
these
details
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
have
thought
pasmer
with
her
buzz
of
activities
and
pretences
rather
a
tedious
little
woman
he
had
some
delicate
tastes
if
not
refined
interests
and
was
expensively
fond
of
certain
sorts
of
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
packing
and
unpacking
it
and
he
had
cases
stored
in
rome
and
london
and
paris
it
had
been
one
of
his
motives
in
consenting
to
come
home
that
he
might
get
them
out
and
set
up
the
various
objects
of
bronze
and
porcelain
in
cabinets
he
had
no
vices
unless
absolute
idleness
ensuing
uninterruptedly
upon
a
remotely
demonstrated
unfitness
for
business
can
be
called
a
vice
like
other
people
who
have
always
been
idle
he
did
not
consider
his
idleness
a
vice
he
rather
plumed
himself
upon
it
for
the
man
who
has
done
nothing
all
his
life
naturally
looks
down
upon
people
who
have
done
or
are
doing
something
in
europe
he
had
not
all
the
advantage
of
this
superiority
which
such
a
man
has
here
he
was
often
thrown
with
other
idle
people
who
had
been
useless
for
so
many
generations
that
they
had
almost
ceased
to
have
any
consciousness
of
it
in
their
presence
pasmer
felt
that
his
uselessness
had
not
that
passive
elegance
which
only
ancestral
uselessness
can
give
that
it
was
positive
and
to
that
degree
vulgar
a
life
like
this
was
not
one
which
would
probably
involve
great
passions
or
affections
and
it
would
be
hard
to
describe
exactly
the
feeling
with
which
he
regarded
his
daughter
he
liked
her
of
course
and
he
had
naturally
expected
certain
things
of
her
as
a
ladylike
intelligence
behaviour
and
appearance
but
he
had
never
shown
any
great
tenderness
for
her
or
even
pride
in
her
she
had
never
given
him
any
displeasure
however
and
he
had
not
shared
his
wife
question
of
mind
at
a
temporary
phase
of
alice
development
when
she
showed
a
decided
inclination
for
a
religious
life
he
had
apparently
not
observed
that
the
girl
had
a
pensive
temperament
in
spite
of
the
effect
of
worldly
splendour
which
her
mother
contrived
for
her
and
that
this
pensiveness
occasionally
deepened
to
gloom
he
had
certainly
never
seen
that
in
a
way
of
her
own
she
was
very
romantic
pasmer
had
seen
it
with
amusement
sometimes
and
sometimes
with
anxiety
but
always
with
the
courage
to
believe
that
she
could
cope
with
it
when
it
was
necessary
whenever
it
was
necessary
she
had
all
the
moral
courage
she
wanted
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
have
it
or
not
as
she
liked
and
in
coming
home
she
had
taken
a
flat
instead
of
a
house
though
she
had
not
talked
with
her
friends
three
minutes
without
perceiving
that
the
moment
when
flats
had
promised
to
assert
their
social
equality
with
houses
in
boston
was
past
for
ever
there
were
of
course
cases
in
which
there
could
be
no
question
of
them
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
plainly
regarded
as
makeshifts
the
resorts
of
people
of
small
means
or
the
defiances
or
errors
of
people
who
had
lived
too
much
abroad
they
stamped
their
occupants
as
of
transitory
and
fluctuant
character
good
people
might
live
in
them
and
did
as
good
people
sometimes
boarded
but
they
could
not
be
regarded
as
forming
a
social
base
except
in
rare
instances
they
presented
peculiar
difficulties
in
calling
and
for
any
sort
of
entertainment
they
were
too
not
public
perhaps
but
evident
in
spite
of
these
objections
pasmer
took
a
flat
in
the
cavendish
and
she
took
it
furnished
from
people
who
were
going
abroad
for
a
year
pasmer
stood
at
the
window
of
this
apartment
the
morning
after
her
call
upon
saintsbury
looking
out
on
the
passage
of
an
load
of
trunks
through
cavendish
square
and
commenting
the
fact
with
the
tacit
reflection
that
it
was
quite
time
she
should
be
getting
away
from
boston
too
when
her
daughter
who
was
looking
out
of
the
other
window
started
significantly
back
what
is
it
alice
nothing
mavering
i
think
and
that
friend
of
his
which
friend
but
where
do
look
they
will
think
we
were
watching
them
i
ca
see
them
at
all
which
way
were
they
going
pasmer
dramatised
a
careless
unconsciousness
to
the
square
while
vividly
betraying
this
anxiety
to
her
daughter
alice
walked
away
to
the
furthest
part
of
the
room
they
are
coming
this
way
she
said
indifferently
before
pasmer
had
time
to
prepare
a
conditional
mood
adapted
either
to
their
coming
that
way
or
going
some
other
she
heard
the
janitor
below
in
colloquy
with
her
maid
in
the
kitchen
and
then
the
maid
came
in
to
ask
if
she
should
say
the
ladies
were
at
home
oh
certainly
said
pasmer
with
a
caressing
politeness
that
anticipated
the
tone
she
meant
to
use
with
mavering
and
his
friend
were
you
going
alice
better
stay
it
would
be
awkward
sending
out
for
you
you
look
well
well
the
young
men
came
in
mavering
with
his
nervous
laugh
first
and
then
boardman
with
his
twinkling
black
eyes
and
his
we
could
go
away
as
far
as
new
london
without
coming
to
see
whether
you
had
really
survived
class
day
said
the
former
addressing
his
solicitude
to
pasmer
i
tried
to
find
out
from
saintsbury
but
she
was
very
he
laughed
again
and
shook
hands
with
alice
whom
he
now
included
in
his
inquiry
i
glad
she
was
said
pasmer
inwardly
wondering
what
he
meant
by
going
to
new
london
if
it
sent
you
to
ask
in
she
made
them
sit
down
and
she
made
as
little
as
possible
of
the
young
ceremony
they
threw
into
the
transaction
to
be
cosy
to
be
at
ease
instantly
was
pasmer
way
we
not
only
survived
we
taken
a
new
lease
of
life
from
class
day
i
for
gotten
how
charming
it
always
was
or
perhaps
it
did
use
to
be
so
charming
i
do
believe
they
have
anything
like
it
in
europe
is
it
always
so
brilliant
i
do
know
said
mavering
i
really
believe
it
was
rather
a
nice
oh
we
were
both
enraptured
cried
pasmer
alice
added
a
quiet
yes
indeed
and
her
mother
went
on
and
we
thought
the
beck
hall
spread
was
the
crowning
glory
of
the
whole
affair
we
owe
ever
so
much
to
your
oh
not
at
all
said
mavering
but
we
were
talking
afterward
alice
and
i
about
the
sudden
transformation
of
all
that
disheveled
crew
around
the
tree
into
the
imposing
swells
may
i
say
howling
swells
yes
do
say
pasmer
implored
the
young
man
whom
we
met
afterward
at
the
spread
she
concluded
how
did
you
manage
it
all
irving
in
the
mail
was
nothing
to
it
we
thought
we
had
walked
directly
over
from
the
tree
and
there
you
were
all
ready
to
receive
us
in
immaculate
evening
it
was
pretty
quick
work
modestly
admitted
the
young
man
could
you
recognise
any
one
in
that
round
the
tree
we
did
till
you
rose
like
a
statue
of
victory
and
began
grabbing
for
the
spoils
from
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
your
friends
who
was
your
pedestal
mavering
put
his
hand
on
his
friend
broad
shoulder
and
gave
him
a
playful
push
boardman
turned
up
his
little
black
eyes
at
him
with
a
funny
gleam
in
them
poor
boardman
said
pasmer
it
did
hurt
him
a
bit
said
mavering
pushing
him
he
liked
of
course
he
did
said
pasmer
implying
in
flattery
of
mavering
that
boardman
might
be
glad
of
the
distinction
and
now
boardman
looked
as
if
he
were
not
she
began
to
get
away
in
adding
but
i
wonder
you
do
kill
each
oh
we
not
so
easily
killed
said
mavering
and
what
a
fairy
scene
it
was
at
the
spread
said
pasmer
turning
to
boardman
she
had
already
talked
its
splendours
over
with
mavering
the
same
evening
i
thought
we
should
never
get
out
of
the
hall
but
when
we
did
get
out
of
the
window
upon
that
tapestried
platform
and
down
on
the
with
turkey
rugs
to
hide
the
bare
spots
in
it
she
stopped
as
people
do
when
it
is
better
to
leave
the
effect
to
the
listener
imagination
yes
i
think
it
was
rather
nice
said
boardman
nice
repeated
pasmer
and
she
looked
at
mavering
is
that
the
famous
harvard
indifferentism
no
no
pasmer
it
just
his
personal
envy
he
was
in
the
spread
and
of
course
he
does
like
to
hear
any
one
praise
it
go
on
they
all
laughed
well
even
boardman
will
admit
said
pasmer
that
nothing
could
have
been
prettier
than
that
pavilion
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
and
the
little
tables
scattered
about
over
it
and
all
those
charming
young
creatures
under
that
lovely
evening
ah
even
boardman
ca
deny
that
we
did
have
the
nicest
crowd
we
well
said
pasmer
playfully
checking
herself
in
a
ready
adhesion
that
depends
a
good
deal
upon
where
boardman
spread
thank
you
said
boardman
he
was
spreading
anywhere
cried
his
friend
except
himself
he
was
spreading
himself
then
i
think
i
should
prefer
to
remain
neutral
said
pasmer
with
a
mock
prudence
which
pleased
the
young
men
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasure
the
was
giving
and
feeling
she
was
all
the
time
aware
that
her
daughter
had
contributed
but
one
remark
to
the
conversation
and
that
she
must
be
seeming
very
stiff
and
cold
she
wondered
what
that
meant
and
whether
she
disliked
this
little
boardman
or
whether
she
was
again
trying
to
punish
mavering
for
something
and
if
so
what
it
was
had
he
offended
her
in
some
way
the
other
day
at
any
rate
she
had
no
right
to
show
it
she
longed
for
some
chance
to
scold
the
girl
and
tell
her
that
it
would
not
do
and
make
her
talk
mavering
was
merely
a
friendly
acquaintance
and
there
could
be
no
question
of
anything
personal
she
forgot
that
between
young
people
the
social
affair
is
always
trembling
to
the
personal
affair
in
the
little
pause
which
these
reflections
gave
her
mother
the
girl
struck
in
with
the
coolness
that
always
astonished
pasmer
and
as
if
she
had
been
merely
waiting
till
some
phase
of
the
talk
interested
her
are
many
of
the
students
going
to
the
race
she
asked
boardman
yes
nearly
everybody
that
is
the
race
queried
pasmer
yes
at
new
london
mavering
broke
in
do
you
know
the
university
race
harvard
and
oh
oh
yes
cried
pasmer
wondering
how
her
daughter
should
know
about
the
race
and
she
not
had
they
talked
it
over
together
on
class
day
she
asked
herself
she
felt
herself
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
keep
even
with
them
left
behind
and
left
out
as
later
age
must
be
distanced
and
excluded
by
youth
are
you
gentlemen
going
to
row
she
asked
mavering
no
they
ruled
the
tubs
out
this
time
and
we
should
send
anything
else
to
the
pasmer
perceived
that
he
was
joking
but
also
that
they
were
not
of
the
crew
and
she
said
that
if
that
was
the
case
the
should
not
go
oh
do
let
that
keep
you
away
are
you
going
i
hoped
you
were
going
continued
the
young
man
speaking
with
his
eyes
on
pasmer
but
with
his
mind
as
she
could
see
by
his
eyes
on
her
daughter
no
oh
do
go
pasmer
he
urged
i
wish
you
go
along
to
chaperon
pasmer
accepted
the
notion
with
amusement
i
should
think
you
might
look
after
each
other
at
any
rate
i
think
i
must
trust
you
to
boardman
this
yes
but
he
going
on
business
persisted
mavering
as
if
for
the
pleasure
he
found
in
fencing
with
the
air
and
he
ca
look
after
on
business
said
pasmer
dropping
her
outspread
fan
on
her
lap
incredulously
yes
he
going
into
journalism
he
gone
into
it
laughed
mavering
and
he
going
down
to
report
the
race
for
the
really
asked
pasmer
with
a
glance
at
boardman
whose
droll
embarrassment
did
not
contradict
his
friend
words
how
splendid
she
cried
i
had
heard
that
a
great
many
harvard
men
were
taking
up
journalism
i
so
glad
of
it
it
will
do
everything
to
elevate
its
boardman
seemed
to
suffer
under
these
expectations
a
little
and
he
stole
a
glance
of
comical
menace
at
his
friend
yes
said
mavering
you
see
a
very
different
tone
about
the
fires
and
the
fights
and
the
distressing
accidents
in
the
after
what
does
he
mean
she
asked
boardman
giving
him
unavoidably
the
advantage
of
the
caressing
manner
which
was
in
her
mind
for
mavering
well
you
see
said
boardman
we
have
to
begin
pretty
low
oh
but
all
departments
of
our
press
need
reforming
do
they
she
inquired
consolingly
one
hears
such
shocking
things
about
our
papers
abroad
i
sure
that
the
more
harvard
men
go
into
them
the
better
and
how
splendid
it
is
to
have
them
going
into
politics
the
way
they
are
they
going
into
politics
too
are
they
she
looked
from
one
young
man
to
the
other
with
an
idea
that
she
was
perhaps
shooting
rather
wild
and
an
amiable
willingness
to
be
laughed
at
if
she
were
why
do
you
go
into
politics
mavering
well
the
fact
is
so
many
of
the
young
university
men
do
in
england
said
pasmer
fortifying
her
position
well
you
see
they
have
got
such
a
complete
machine
in
england
oh
yes
that
dreadful
machine
sighed
pasmer
who
had
heard
of
it
but
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
it
was
do
you
think
the
harvard
crew
will
beat
this
time
alice
asked
of
boardman
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
oh
but
you
must
never
believe
him
when
he
begins
that
way
cried
mavering
to
be
sure
they
will
beat
and
you
ought
to
be
there
to
see
it
now
why
wo
you
come
pasmer
he
pleaded
turning
to
her
mother
oh
i
afraid
we
must
be
getting
away
from
boston
by
that
time
very
tiresome
but
there
seems
to
be
nobody
left
and
one
ca
stay
quite
alone
even
if
you
sick
of
moving
about
have
you
ever
been
we
think
of
going
there
to
campobello
no
but
i
hear
that
it
charming
there
i
had
a
friend
who
was
there
last
year
and
he
said
it
was
charming
the
only
trouble
is
it
so
far
you
pretty
well
on
the
way
to
europe
when
you
get
there
you
know
it
all
hotel
life
yes
it
quite
a
new
place
is
it
well
it
been
opened
up
several
years
and
they
say
it
is
like
the
hotel
life
anywhere
else
it
charming
and
there
the
very
nicest
class
of
very
nice
philadelphia
people
i
hear
said
pasmer
and
baltimore
do
you
think
it
well
she
asked
deferentially
and
under
correction
if
she
were
hazarding
too
much
to
see
somebody
besides
boston
people
sometimes
if
they
nice
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
living
oh
i
think
there
are
nice
people
everywhere
said
the
young
man
with
the
bold
expansion
of
youth
yes
sighed
pasmer
we
saw
two
such
delightful
young
people
coming
in
and
out
of
the
hotel
in
rome
we
were
sure
they
were
english
and
they
were
from
chicago
but
there
are
not
many
western
people
at
campobello
are
there
i
really
do
know
said
mavering
how
is
it
boardman
do
many
of
your
people
go
there
you
know
you
do
make
it
so
frightfully
expensive
with
your
money
said
pasmer
explaining
with
a
prompt
effect
of
having
known
all
along
that
boardman
was
from
the
west
you
drive
us
poor
people
all
i
do
think
my
money
would
do
it
said
boardman
quietly
oh
you
wait
till
you
a
syndicate
correspondent
said
mavering
putting
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
and
rising
by
aid
of
it
he
left
pasmer
to
fill
the
chasm
that
had
so
suddenly
yawned
between
her
and
boardman
and
while
she
tumbled
into
every
sort
of
flowery
friendliness
and
compliment
telling
him
she
should
look
out
for
his
account
of
the
race
with
the
greatest
interest
and
expressing
the
hope
that
he
would
get
as
far
as
campobello
during
the
summer
mavering
found
some
minutes
for
talk
with
alice
he
was
graver
with
her
far
graver
than
with
her
mother
not
only
because
she
was
a
more
serious
nature
but
because
they
were
both
young
and
youth
is
not
free
with
youth
except
by
slow
and
cautious
degrees
in
that
little
space
of
time
they
talked
of
pictures
propos
of
some
on
the
wall
and
of
books
because
of
those
on
the
table
oh
yes
said
pasmer
when
they
paused
and
she
felt
that
her
piece
of
difficult
engineering
had
been
quite
successful
mrs
saintsbury
was
telling
me
what
a
wonderful
connoisseur
of
etchings
your
father
i
believe
he
does
know
something
about
them
said
the
young
man
modestly
and
he
gone
back
already
oh
yes
he
never
stays
long
away
from
my
mother
i
shall
be
going
home
myself
as
soon
as
i
get
back
from
the
and
shall
you
spend
the
summer
there
part
of
it
i
always
like
to
do
perhaps
when
you
get
away
you
come
as
far
as
campobello
with
boardman
she
added
has
boardman
promised
to
go
laughed
mavering
he
will
promise
anything
well
i
come
to
campobello
if
you
come
to
new
london
do
come
pasmer
the
mother
stood
watching
the
two
young
men
from
the
window
as
they
made
their
way
across
the
square
together
she
had
now
for
some
reason
no
apparent
scruple
in
being
seen
to
do
so
how
ridiculous
that
stout
little
boardman
is
with
him
said
pasmer
he
hardly
comes
up
to
his
shoulder
why
in
the
world
should
he
have
brought
him
i
thought
he
was
very
pleasant
said
the
girl
yes
yes
of
course
and
i
suppose
he
have
felt
that
it
was
rather
pointed
coming
pointed
young
men
are
so
queer
did
you
like
that
kind
of
collar
he
had
on
i
did
notice
so
very
very
i
suppose
he
has
rather
a
long
well
what
did
you
think
of
his
urging
us
to
go
to
the
race
do
you
think
he
meant
it
do
you
think
he
intended
it
for
an
invitation
i
do
think
he
meant
anything
or
if
he
did
i
think
he
did
know
yes
said
pasmer
vaguely
that
must
be
what
saintsbury
meant
by
the
artistic
i
like
people
to
be
sincere
and
not
to
say
things
they
do
mean
or
do
know
whether
they
mean
or
not
said
alice
yes
of
course
that
the
best
way
admitted
pasmer
it
the
only
way
she
added
as
if
it
were
her
own
invariable
practice
then
she
added
further
i
wonder
what
he
did
mean
she
began
to
yawn
for
after
her
simulation
of
vivid
interest
in
them
the
visit
of
the
young
men
had
fatigued
her
in
the
midst
of
her
yawn
her
daughter
went
out
of
the
room
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
she
suspended
the
yawn
long
enough
to
smile
and
then
finished
it
xi
after
first
going
to
the
owen
at
campobello
the
pasmers
took
rooms
at
the
which
is
so
much
gayer
even
if
it
is
not
so
characteristic
of
the
old
welsh
admiral
baronial
possession
of
the
island
it
is
characteristic
enough
and
perched
on
its
bluff
overlooking
the
bay
or
whatever
the
body
of
water
is
it
sees
a
score
of
pretty
isles
and
long
reaches
of
mainland
coast
with
a
white
marble
effect
of
wooden
eastport
nestled
in
the
wide
lap
of
the
shore
in
apparent
luxury
and
apparent
innocence
of
smuggling
and
the
manufacture
of
herring
sardines
the
waters
that
wrap
the
island
in
morning
and
evening
fog
temper
the
air
of
the
latitude
to
a
newport
softness
in
summer
with
a
sort
of
inner
coolness
that
is
peculiarly
delicious
lulling
the
day
with
long
calms
and
light
breezes
and
after
nightfall
commonly
sending
a
stiff
gale
to
try
the
stops
of
the
gables
and
casements
and
to
make
the
cheerful
blaze
on
its
public
hearths
acceptable
once
or
twice
a
day
the
eastport
arrives
with
passengers
from
the
southward
at
a
floating
wharf
that
sinks
or
swims
half
a
hundred
feet
on
the
mighty
tides
of
the
northeast
but
all
night
long
the
island
is
shut
up
to
its
own
memories
and
devices
the
pretty
romance
of
the
old
sailor
who
left
england
to
become
a
sort
of
feudal
seigneur
here
with
a
holding
of
the
entire
island
and
its
for
his
villeins
forms
a
picturesque
background
for
the
aesthetic
leisure
and
society
in
the
three
hotels
remembering
him
and
his
language
in
their
names
and
housing
with
a
few
cottages
all
the
sojourners
on
the
island
by
day
the
broad
hotel
piazzas
shelter
such
of
the
guests
as
prefer
to
let
others
make
their
excursions
into
the
heart
of
the
island
and
around
its
rocky
borders
and
at
night
when
the
falling
mists
have
brought
the
early
dark
and
from
lighthouse
to
lighthouse
the
moan
and
low
to
one
another
the
piazzas
cede
to
the
corridors
and
the
parlours
and
the
life
does
not
greatly
differ
from
other
seaside
hotel
life
on
the
surface
and
if
one
were
to
make
distinctions
one
would
perhaps
begin
by
saying
that
hotel
society
there
has
much
of
the
tone
of
cottage
society
elsewhere
with
a
little
more
accessibility
as
the
reader
doubtless
knows
the
great
mass
of
boston
society
thoughtful
of
its
own
weight
and
bulk
transports
itself
down
the
north
shore
scarcely
further
than
manchester
at
the
furthest
but
there
are
more
courageous
or
more
detachable
spirits
who
venture
into
more
distant
regions
these
contribute
somewhat
toward
peopling
bar
harbour
in
the
summer
but
they
scarcely
characterise
it
in
any
degree
while
at
campobello
they
settle
in
little
daring
colonies
whose
will
enlist
the
admiration
of
the
sympathetic
observer
they
do
not
refuse
the
knowledge
of
other
colonies
of
other
stirps
and
origins
and
they
even
combine
in
temporary
alliance
with
them
but
after
all
boston
speaks
one
language
and
new
york
another
and
washington
a
third
and
though
the
several
dialects
have
only
slight
differences
of
inflection
their
moral
accents
render
each
a
little
difficult
for
the
others
in
fact
every
society
is
repellant
of
strangers
in
the
degree
that
it
is
sufficient
to
itself
and
is
incurious
concerning
the
rest
of
the
world
if
it
has
not
the
elements
of
in
it
if
it
is
uninformed
and
new
and
restless
it
is
more
hospitable
than
an
older
society
which
has
a
sense
of
merit
founded
upon
historical
documents
and
need
no
longer
go
out
of
itself
for
comparisons
of
any
sort
knowing
that
if
it
seeks
anything
better
it
will
probably
be
disappointed
the
natural
man
the
savage
is
as
indifferent
to
others
as
the
exclusive
and
those
who
accuse
the
coldness
of
the
bostonians
and
their
reluctant
or
repellant
behaviour
toward
unknown
people
accuse
not
only
civilisation
but
nature
itself
that
love
of
independence
which
is
notable
in
us
even
in
our
most
acquiescent
phases
at
home
is
perhaps
what
brings
these
cultivated
and
agreeable
people
so
far
away
where
they
can
achieve
a
sort
of
sylvan
urbanity
without
responsibility
and
without
that
measuring
of
purses
which
attends
the
summer
display
elsewhere
at
campobello
one
might
be
poor
with
almost
as
little
shame
as
in
cambridge
if
one
were
cultivated
pasmer
who
seldom
failed
of
doing
just
the
right
thing
for
herself
had
promptly
divined
the
advantages
of
campobello
for
her
family
she
knew
by
dint
of
a
little
inquiry
and
from
the
volunteer
information
of
enthusiasts
who
had
been
there
the
summer
before
just
who
was
likely
to
be
there
during
the
summer
with
which
she
now
found
herself
confronted
campobello
being
yet
a
new
thing
it
was
not
open
to
the
objection
that
you
were
sure
to
meet
such
and
such
people
more
or
less
common
or
disagreeable
there
whatever
happened
it
could
be
lightly
handled
in
the
retrospect
as
the
adventure
of
a
partial
and
fragmentary
summer
when
really
she
hardly
cared
where
they
went
they
did
not
get
away
from
boston
before
the
middle
of
july
and
after
the
solitude
they
left
behind
them
there
the
owen
at
first
seemed
very
gay
but
when
they
had
once
or
twice
compared
it
with
the
riding
to
and
fro
in
the
barge
which
formed
the
connecting
link
with
the
saturday
evening
hops
of
the
latter
hotel
pasmer
decided
that
from
alice
point
of
view
they
had
made
a
mistake
and
she
repaired
it
without
delay
the
young
people
were
in
fact
all
at
the
and
though
she
found
the
owen
perfectly
satisfying
for
herself
and
pasmer
she
was
willing
to
make
the
sacrifice
of
going
to
a
new
place
it
was
not
a
great
sacrifice
for
one
who
had
dwelt
so
long
in
tents
there
were
scarcely
any
young
girls
at
the
owen
and
no
young
men
of
course
even
at
the
where
young
girls
abounded
it
would
not
be
right
to
pretend
that
there
were
young
men
enough
nowhere
perhaps
except
at
bar
harbour
is
the
balance
of
the
sexes
trimmed
in
new
england
and
even
there
the
observer
abstractly
delighting
in
the
young
girls
and
their
dresses
at
that
grand
of
rodick
must
question
whether
the
adjustment
is
perfectly
accurate
at
campobello
there
were
not
more
than
half
enough
young
men
and
there
was
not
enough
flirtation
to
affect
the
prevailing
social
mood
of
the
place
an
unfevered
expectationless
tranquillity
in
which
is
like
yesterday
and
can
not
be
different
it
is
a
quiet
of
light
reading
and
slowly
brokenly
murmured
contented
gossip
for
the
ladies
of
old
newspapers
and
old
stories
and
luxuriously
meditated
cigars
for
the
men
with
occasional
combinations
for
a
cruise
among
the
eddies
and
islands
of
the
nearer
waters
or
a
voyage
further
off
in
the
bay
of
fundy
to
the
grand
menan
and
a
return
for
the
late
dinner
which
marks
the
high
civilisation
of
campobello
and
then
an
evening
of
more
reading
and
gossip
and
cigars
while
the
night
wind
whistles
outside
and
the
brawl
and
crash
of
the
balls
among
the
tenpins
comes
softened
from
the
distant
alleys
there
are
pleasant
walks
which
people
seldom
take
in
many
directions
and
there
are
drives
and
all
through
the
dense
sad
northern
woods
which
still
savagely
clothe
the
greater
part
of
the
island
to
its
further
shores
where
there
are
shelves
and
plateaus
of
rock
incomparable
for
picnicking
one
need
ask
nothing
better
in
fact
than
to
stroll
down
the
sylvan
road
that
leads
to
the
owen
past
the
little
with
its
sheds
for
curing
herring
and
the
pale
blue
smoke
and
appetising
savour
escaping
from
them
and
past
the
little
chapel
with
which
the
old
admiral
attested
his
love
of
the
established
rite
on
this
road
you
may
sometimes
meet
a
little
english
bishop
from
the
provinces
in
his
apron
and
and
there
is
a
certain
bridge
over
a
narrow
estuary
where
in
the
shallow
pools
of
the
deeply
ebbing
tide
you
may
throw
stones
at
sculpin
and
witness
the
admirable
indifference
of
those
fish
to
human
cruelty
and
folly
in
the
middle
distance
you
will
see
a
group
of
herring
weirs
which
with
their
coronals
of
tufted
saplings
form
the
very
most
picturesque
aspect
of
any
fishing
industry
you
may
now
and
then
find
an
artist
at
this
point
who
crouched
over
his
easel
or
hers
seems
to
agree
with
you
about
the
village
and
the
weirs
but
alice
pasmer
cared
little
more
for
such
things
than
her
mother
did
and
pasmer
regarded
nature
in
all
her
aspects
simply
as
an
adjunct
of
society
or
an
occasional
feature
of
the
entourage
the
girl
had
no
such
worldly
feeling
about
it
but
she
found
slight
sympathy
in
the
moods
of
earth
and
sky
with
her
peculiar
temperament
this
temperament
whose
recondite
origin
had
almost
wholly
broken
up
pasmer
faith
in
heredity
was
like
other
temperaments
not
always
in
evidence
and
alice
was
variously
regarded
as
cold
of
shy
or
proud
or
insipid
by
the
various
other
temperaments
brought
in
contact
with
her
own
she
was
apt
to
be
liked
because
she
was
as
careful
of
others
as
she
was
of
herself
and
she
never
was
childishly
greedy
about
such
admiration
as
she
won
as
girls
often
are
perhaps
because
she
did
not
care
for
it
up
to
this
time
it
is
doubtful
if
her
heart
had
been
touched
even
by
the
fancies
that
shake
the
surface
of
the
soul
of
youth
and
perhaps
it
was
for
this
reason
that
her
seriousness
at
first
fretted
pasmer
with
a
vague
anxiety
for
her
future
pasmer
herself
remained
inalienably
unitarian
but
she
was
aware
of
the
which
the
church
had
been
making
in
society
and
when
alice
showed
her
inclination
for
it
she
felt
that
it
was
not
at
all
as
if
she
had
developed
a
taste
for
orthodoxy
when
finally
it
did
not
seem
likely
to
go
too
far
it
amused
pasmer
that
her
daughter
should
have
taken
so
intensely
to
the
anglican
rite
in
the
hotel
it
attached
to
her
by
a
common
interest
several
of
the
ladies
who
had
seen
her
earnestly
responsive
at
the
little
owen
chapel
ladies
left
to
that
affectional
solitude
which
awaits
long
widowhood
through
the
death
or
marriage
of
children
and
other
ladies
younger
but
yet
beginning
to
grow
old
with
touching
courage
alice
was
especially
a
favourite
with
the
three
or
four
who
represented
their
class
and
condition
at
the
coed
and
who
read
the
best
books
read
there
and
had
the
gentlest
manners
there
was
a
tacit
agreement
among
these
ladies
who
could
not
help
seeing
the
difference
in
the
temperaments
of
the
mother
and
daughter
that
pasmer
did
not
understand
alice
but
probably
there
were
very
few
people
except
herself
whom
pasmer
did
not
understand
quite
well
she
understood
these
ladies
and
their
compassion
for
alice
and
she
did
not
in
the
least
resent
it
she
was
willing
that
people
should
like
alice
for
any
reason
they
chose
if
they
did
not
go
too
far
with
her
little
flutter
of
futile
deceits
her
irreverence
for
every
form
of
human
worth
and
her
trust
in
a
providence
which
had
seldom
failed
her
she
smiled
at
the
cult
of
alice
friends
as
she
did
at
the
girl
seriousness
which
also
she
felt
herself
able
to
keep
from
going
too
far
while
she
did
not
object
to
the
sympathy
of
these
ladies
whatever
inspired
it
she
encouraged
another
intimacy
which
grew
up
contemporaneously
with
theirs
and
which
was
frankly
secular
and
practical
though
the
girl
who
attached
herself
to
alice
with
one
of
those
instant
passions
of
girlhood
was
also
in
every
exterior
observance
a
strict
and
diligent
churchwoman
the
difference
was
through
the
difference
of
boston
and
new
york
in
everything
the
difference
between
idealising
and
the
realising
tendency
the
elderly
and
boston
women
who
liked
alice
had
been
touched
by
something
high
yet
sad
in
the
beauty
of
her
face
at
church
the
new
york
girl
promptly
owned
that
she
had
liked
her
effect
the
first
sunday
she
saw
her
there
and
she
knew
in
a
minute
she
never
got
those
things
on
this
side
her
obeisances
and
genuflections
throughout
the
service
much
more
profound
and
punctilious
than
those
of
any
one
else
there
had
apparently
not
prevented
her
from
making
a
thorough
study
of
alice
costume
and
a
correct
conjecture
as
to
its
authorship
miss
anderson
who
claimed
a
collateral
dutch
ancestry
by
the
van
hook
tucked
in
between
her
family
name
and
the
julia
given
her
in
christening
was
of
the
ordinary
slender
make
of
american
girlhood
with
dull
blond
hair
and
a
dull
blond
complexion
which
would
have
left
her
face
uninteresting
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
caprice
of
her
nose
in
suddenly
changing
from
the
ordinary
american
regularity
after
getting
over
its
bridge
and
turning
out
distinctly
this
gave
her
profile
animation
and
character
you
could
not
expect
a
girl
with
that
nose
to
be
either
irresolute
or
commonplace
and
for
good
or
for
ill
miss
anderson
was
decided
and
original
she
carried
her
figure
which
was
no
great
things
of
a
figure
as
to
height
with
vigorous
erectness
she
walked
with
long
strides
knocking
her
skirts
into
fine
eddies
and
tangles
as
she
went
and
she
spoke
in
a
bold
deep
voice
with
tones
like
a
man
in
it
all
the
more
amusing
and
fascinating
because
of
the
perfectly
feminine
eyes
with
which
she
looked
at
you
and
the
nervous
feminine
gestures
which
she
used
while
she
spoke
she
took
pasmer
into
her
confidence
with
regard
to
alice
at
an
early
stage
of
their
acquaintance
which
from
the
first
had
a
patronising
or
rather
protecting
quality
in
it
if
she
owned
herself
less
fine
she
knew
herself
shrewder
and
more
capable
of
coping
with
actualities
i
think
she
moybid
alice
is
she
said
she
is
moybid
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
but
she
expects
more
of
herself
and
of
the
woyld
generally
than
anybody
going
to
get
out
of
it
she
thinks
going
to
get
as
much
as
she
gives
and
that
a
great
mistake
pasmer
she
said
with
that
peculiar
liquefaction
of
the
canine
letter
which
the
alone
have
the
trick
of
and
which
it
would
be
tiresome
and
futile
to
try
to
represent
throughout
her
talk
oh
yes
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
pasmer
deep
in
her
throat
and
reserving
deeper
still
her
enjoyment
of
this
early
wisdom
of
miss
anderson
now
even
at
church
she
carries
the
same
spirit
into
the
church
she
does
make
allowance
for
human
nature
and
the
church
oh
certainly
pasmer
agreed
she
is
like
a
person
that
been
brought
up
in
the
church
it
more
like
the
old
puritan
excuse
me
pasmer
yes
indeed
say
anything
you
like
about
the
puritans
said
pasmer
delighted
that
as
a
bostonian
she
should
be
thought
to
care
for
them
i
always
forget
that
you
a
bostonian
miss
anderson
apologized
oh
thank
you
cried
pasmer
i
going
to
try
to
make
her
like
other
girls
continued
miss
anderson
do
said
alice
mother
with
the
effect
of
wishing
her
joy
of
the
undertaking
if
there
were
a
few
young
men
about
a
little
over
seventeen
and
a
little
under
fifty
it
would
be
easier
said
miss
anderson
thoughtfully
but
how
are
you
going
to
make
a
girl
like
other
girls
when
there
are
no
young
men
that
very
true
said
pasmer
with
an
interest
which
she
of
course
did
her
best
to
make
impersonal
do
you
think
there
will
be
more
later
on
they
will
have
to
huey
up
if
they
are
comin
said
miss
anderson
it
the
middle
of
august
now
and
the
hotel
closes
the
second
week
in
yes
said
pasmer
vaguely
looking
at
alice
she
had
just
appeared
over
the
brow
of
the
precipice
along
whose
face
the
arrivals
and
departures
by
the
at
campobello
obliquely
ascend
and
descend
she
came
walking
swiftly
toward
the
hotel
and
for
her
so
excitedly
that
pasmer
involuntarily
rose
and
went
to
meet
her
at
the
top
of
the
broad
hotel
steps
what
is
it
alice
oh
nothing
i
thought
i
saw
munt
coming
off
the
mr
munt
she
would
not
stay
for
further
question
her
mother
looked
after
her
with
the
edge
of
her
fan
over
her
mouth
till
she
disappeared
in
the
depths
of
the
hotel
corridor
then
she
sat
down
near
the
steps
and
chatted
with
some
boys
lounging
on
the
balustrade
and
waited
for
munt
to
come
up
over
the
brink
of
the
precipice
dan
mavering
came
with
him
running
forward
with
a
polite
eagerness
at
sight
of
pasmer
she
distributed
a
skillful
astonishment
equally
between
the
two
men
she
had
equally
expected
to
see
and
was
extremely
cordial
with
them
not
only
because
she
was
pleased
with
them
but
because
she
was
still
more
pleased
with
her
daughter
being
after
all
like
other
girls
when
it
came
to
essentials
xii
alice
came
down
to
lunch
in
a
dress
which
reconciled
the
seaside
and
the
in
an
effect
entirely
satisfactory
to
her
mother
and
gave
her
hand
to
both
the
gentlemen
without
the
affectation
of
surprise
at
seeing
either
i
saw
munt
coning
up
from
the
boat
she
said
in
answer
to
mavering
demand
for
some
sort
of
astonishment
from
her
i
certain
that
it
was
pasmer
whose
pretences
had
been
all
given
away
by
this
simple
confession
did
not
resent
it
she
was
so
much
pleased
with
her
daughter
evident
excitement
at
the
young
man
having
come
without
being
conscious
of
it
perhaps
alice
prettily
assumed
the
part
of
hostess
from
the
moment
of
their
meeting
and
did
the
honours
of
the
hotel
with
a
tacit
implication
of
knowing
that
he
had
come
to
see
her
there
they
had
only
met
twice
but
now
the
third
time
meeting
after
a
little
separation
their
manner
toward
each
other
was
as
if
their
acquaintance
had
been
making
progress
in
the
interval
she
took
him
about
quite
as
if
he
had
joined
their
family
party
and
introduced
him
to
miss
anderson
and
to
all
her
particular
friends
for
each
of
whom
within
five
minutes
after
his
presentation
he
contrived
to
do
some
winning
service
she
introduced
him
to
her
father
whom
he
treated
with
deep
respect
and
said
sir
to
she
showed
him
the
bowling
alley
and
began
to
play
tennis
with
him
her
mother
sitting
with
john
munt
on
the
piazza
followed
these
polite
attentions
to
mavering
with
humorous
satisfaction
which
was
qualified
as
they
went
on
alice
she
said
to
her
at
a
chance
which
offered
itself
during
the
evening
and
then
she
hesitated
for
the
right
word
well
mamma
said
the
girl
impatiently
stopping
on
her
way
to
walk
up
and
down
the
piazza
with
mavering
she
had
run
in
to
get
a
wrap
and
a
cap
do
overdo
the
what
do
you
mean
mamma
asked
the
girl
dropping
her
arms
before
her
and
letting
the
shawl
trail
on
the
floor
do
you
think
he
was
very
kind
to
us
on
class
day
her
mother
laughed
but
every
one
may
know
it
alice
went
out
but
she
came
back
in
a
little
while
and
went
up
to
her
room
without
speaking
to
any
one
the
fits
of
elation
and
depression
with
which
this
first
day
passed
for
her
succeeded
one
another
during
mavering
stay
he
did
not
need
alice
chaperonage
long
by
the
next
morning
he
seemed
to
know
and
to
like
everybody
in
the
hotel
where
he
enjoyed
a
general
favour
which
at
that
moment
had
no
exceptions
in
the
afternoon
he
began
to
organise
excursions
and
amusements
with
the
help
of
miss
anderson
the
plans
all
referred
to
alice
who
accepted
and
approved
with
an
authority
which
every
one
tacitly
admitted
just
as
every
one
recognised
that
mavering
had
come
to
campobello
because
she
was
there
such
a
phase
is
perhaps
the
prettiest
in
the
history
of
a
love
affair
all
is
yet
in
solution
nothing
has
been
precipitated
in
word
or
fact
the
parties
to
it
even
reserve
a
final
construction
of
what
they
themselves
say
or
do
they
will
not
own
to
their
hearts
that
they
mean
exactly
this
or
that
it
is
this
phase
which
in
its
perfect
freedom
is
the
most
american
of
all
under
other
conditions
it
is
an
instant
perceptible
or
imperceptible
under
ours
it
is
a
distinct
stage
unhurried
by
any
outside
influences
the
nearest
approach
to
a
definition
of
the
situation
was
in
a
walk
between
mavering
and
pasmer
and
this
talk
too
light
and
brief
might
have
had
no
such
intention
as
her
fancy
assigned
his
part
of
it
she
recurred
to
something
that
had
been
said
on
class
day
about
his
taking
up
the
law
immediately
or
going
abroad
first
for
a
year
oh
i
abandoned
europe
altogether
for
the
present
he
said
laughing
and
i
do
know
but
i
may
go
back
on
the
law
indeed
then
you
are
going
to
be
an
artist
oh
no
not
so
bad
as
that
it
is
settled
yet
and
i
off
here
to
think
it
over
a
while
before
the
law
school
opens
in
september
my
father
wants
me
to
go
into
his
business
and
turn
my
powers
to
account
in
designing
oh
how
very
interesting
at
the
same
time
pasmer
ran
over
the
whole
field
of
her
acquaintance
without
finding
another
maker
in
it
but
she
remembered
what
saintsbury
had
said
it
was
manufacturing
this
reminded
her
to
ask
if
he
had
seen
the
saintsburys
lately
and
he
said
no
he
believed
they
were
still
in
cambridge
though
and
we
shall
actually
see
a
young
man
she
said
finally
in
the
act
of
deciding
his
own
destiny
he
laughed
for
pleasure
in
her
persiflage
yes
only
do
give
me
away
nobody
else
knows
oh
no
indeed
too
much
flattered
mavering
shall
you
let
me
know
when
you
decided
i
shall
be
dying
to
know
and
i
shall
be
too
to
it
was
not
then
too
late
to
adapt
to
any
exigency
of
life
and
mavering
said
you
will
learn
from
the
expression
of
my
xiii
the
witnesses
of
mavering
successful
efforts
to
make
everybody
like
him
were
interested
in
his
differentiation
of
the
attentions
he
offered
every
age
and
sex
from
those
he
paid
alice
but
while
they
all
agreed
that
there
never
was
a
sweeter
fellow
they
would
have
been
puzzled
to
say
in
just
what
this
difference
consisted
and
much
as
they
liked
him
the
ladies
of
her
cult
were
not
quite
satisfied
with
him
till
they
decided
that
it
was
marked
by
an
anxiety
a
timidity
which
was
perfectly
fascinating
in
a
man
so
far
from
bashfulness
as
he
that
is
he
did
nice
things
for
others
without
asking
but
with
her
there
was
always
an
explicit
pause
and
an
implicit
prayer
and
permission
first
upon
this
condition
they
consented
to
the
glamour
which
he
had
for
her
and
which
was
evident
to
every
one
probably
but
him
once
agreeing
that
no
one
was
good
enough
for
alice
pasmer
whose
qualities
they
felt
that
only
women
could
really
appreciate
they
were
interested
to
see
how
near
mavering
could
come
to
being
good
enough
and
as
the
drama
played
itself
before
their
eyes
they
pleased
themselves
in
analysing
its
hero
he
is
not
bashful
certainly
said
one
of
a
little
group
who
sat
midway
of
the
piazza
while
alice
and
mavering
walked
up
and
down
together
but
do
you
think
he
modest
there
that
difference
you
the
lady
addressed
waited
so
long
before
answering
that
the
young
couple
came
abreast
of
the
group
and
then
she
had
to
wait
till
they
were
out
of
hearing
yes
she
said
then
with
a
tender
sighing
thoughtfulness
i
felt
that
in
him
and
really
think
he
is
a
very
loveable
nature
the
only
question
would
be
whether
he
was
too
yes
said
the
first
lady
with
the
same
kind
of
suspiration
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
suppose
they
ought
to
be
something
more
alike
in
or
sympathies
suggested
the
other
yes
or
a
third
lady
laughed
a
little
mr
mavering
has
so
many
sympathies
that
he
ought
to
be
like
her
in
some
of
do
you
mean
that
he
too
sympathetic
that
he
is
sincere
asked
the
first
a
single
lady
of
a
miss
cotton
who
had
a
little
knot
of
conscience
between
her
pretty
eyebrows
tied
there
by
the
unremitting
effort
of
half
a
century
to
do
and
say
exactly
the
truth
and
to
find
it
out
brinkley
whom
she
addressed
was
of
that
obesity
which
seems
often
to
incline
people
to
sarcasm
no
i
do
think
he
insincere
i
think
he
always
means
what
he
says
and
does
well
do
you
think
a
little
more
concentration
of
would
hurt
him
for
miss
pasmer
purpose
if
she
has
it
yes
i
see
said
miss
cotton
she
waited
with
her
kind
eyes
fixed
wistfully
upon
alice
for
the
young
people
to
approach
and
get
by
i
wonder
what
the
men
think
of
him
you
might
ask
miss
anderson
said
brinkley
oh
do
you
think
they
tell
her
not
that
exactly
said
brinkley
shaking
with
pleasure
in
her
joke
her
voice
oh
yes
she
and
alice
are
great
friends
of
i
should
think
said
stamwell
the
second
speaker
that
mavering
would
be
jealous
sometimes
till
he
looked
yes
said
miss
cotton
obliged
to
admit
the
force
of
the
remark
but
feeling
that
mavering
had
been
carried
out
of
the
field
of
her
vision
by
the
turn
of
the
talk
i
suppose
she
continued
that
he
would
be
so
well
liked
by
other
young
men
as
she
is
by
other
girls
do
you
think
i
do
think
as
a
rule
said
brinkley
that
men
are
half
so
appreciative
of
one
another
as
women
are
it
most
amusing
to
see
the
open
scorn
with
which
two
young
fellows
treat
each
other
if
a
pretty
girl
introduces
all
the
ladies
joined
in
the
laugh
with
which
brinkley
herself
led
off
but
miss
cotton
stopped
laughing
first
do
you
mean
she
asked
that
if
a
gentleman
were
generally
popular
with
gentlemen
it
would
be
because
he
was
generally
so
with
women
something
like
that
if
you
leave
mavering
out
of
the
question
oh
how
very
good
of
them
she
broke
off
and
all
the
ladies
glanced
at
mavering
and
alice
where
they
had
stopped
at
the
further
end
of
the
piazza
and
were
looking
off
now
i
can
probably
finish
before
they
get
back
here
again
what
i
do
mean
miss
cotton
is
that
neither
sex
willingly
accepts
the
favourites
of
the
yes
said
miss
cotton
admissively
and
all
that
saves
miss
pasmer
is
that
she
has
not
only
the
qualities
that
women
like
in
women
but
some
of
the
qualities
that
men
like
in
them
she
thoroughly
a
little
sensation
almost
a
murmur
not
wholly
of
assent
went
round
that
circle
which
had
so
nearly
voted
alice
a
saint
in
the
first
place
she
likes
to
please
oh
came
from
the
group
and
that
makes
them
like
her
if
it
does
go
too
far
as
her
mother
the
ladies
all
laughed
recognising
a
common
turn
of
phrase
in
pasmer
i
should
think
said
stamwell
that
she
would
believe
a
little
in
heredity
if
she
noticed
that
in
her
daughter
and
the
ladies
laughed
again
then
brinkley
resumed
concerning
alice
she
has
a
very
pretty
face
an
extremely
pretty
face
she
has
a
tender
voice
and
she
very
very
graceful
in
rather
an
odd
way
perhaps
it
only
a
fascinating
awkwardness
then
she
dresses
or
her
mother
dresses
her
the
ladies
with
another
sensation
admitted
the
perfect
accuracy
with
which
these
points
had
been
touched
that
what
men
like
what
they
fall
in
love
with
what
in
love
with
this
instant
it
no
use
women
flattering
themselves
that
they
do
for
they
do
the
rest
of
the
virtues
and
graces
and
charms
are
for
women
if
that
serious
girl
could
only
know
the
silly
things
that
that
amiable
simpleton
is
taken
with
in
her
she
never
speak
to
him
again
suggested
miss
cotton
no
i
do
say
that
but
she
would
think
twice
before
marrying
and
then
do
it
said
stamwell
pensively
with
eyes
that
seemed
looking
far
into
the
past
yes
and
quite
right
to
do
it
said
brinkley
i
do
know
that
we
should
be
very
proud
ourselves
if
we
confessed
just
what
caught
our
fancy
in
our
husbands
for
my
part
i
should
like
to
say
how
much
a
light
hat
that
brinkley
happened
to
be
wearing
had
to
do
with
the
the
ladies
broke
into
another
laugh
and
then
checked
themselves
so
that
pasmer
coming
out
of
the
corridor
upon
them
naturally
thought
they
were
laughing
at
her
she
reflected
that
if
she
had
been
in
their
place
she
would
have
shown
greater
tact
by
not
stopping
just
at
that
instant
but
she
did
not
mind
she
knew
that
they
talked
her
over
but
having
a
very
good
conscience
she
simply
talked
them
over
in
return
have
you
seen
my
daughter
within
a
few
minutes
she
asked
she
was
with
mavering
at
the
end
of
the
piazza
a
moment
ago
said
brinkley
they
must
leave
just
gone
round
the
corner
of
the
oh
said
pasmer
she
had
a
novel
with
her
finger
between
its
leaves
pressed
against
her
heart
after
the
manner
of
ladies
coming
out
on
hotel
piazzas
she
sat
down
and
rested
it
on
her
knee
with
her
hand
over
the
top
miss
cotton
bent
forward
and
pasmer
lifted
her
fingers
to
let
her
see
the
name
of
the
book
oh
yes
said
miss
cotton
but
he
so
terribly
pessimistic
do
you
think
what
is
it
asked
brinkley
fumee
said
pasmer
laying
the
book
title
upward
on
her
lap
for
every
one
to
see
oh
yes
said
brinkley
fanning
herself
tourguenief
that
man
gave
me
the
worst
quarter
of
an
hour
with
his
that
i
ever
that
the
same
as
the
des
gentilshommes
is
it
asked
pasmer
with
the
involuntary
superiority
of
a
woman
who
reads
her
tourguenief
in
french
i
do
know
i
had
it
in
english
i
do
build
my
ships
to
cross
the
sea
in
as
emerson
says
i
take
those
i
find
ah
i
was
already
on
the
other
side
said
pasmer
softly
she
added
i
must
get
lisa
i
like
a
good
do
you
if
what
gave
you
the
bad
where
lavretsky
comes
back
old
to
the
scene
of
his
love
for
lisa
and
strikes
that
chord
on
the
piano
well
i
simply
wonder
that
i
alive
to
recommend
the
book
to
you
do
you
know
said
miss
cotton
very
deferentially
that
your
daughter
always
made
me
think
of
lisa
indeed
cried
pasmer
not
wholly
pleased
but
gratified
that
she
was
able
to
hide
her
displeasure
you
make
me
very
oh
i
doubt
if
you
see
more
than
a
mere
likeness
of
temperament
brinkley
interfered
bluntly
all
the
conditions
are
so
different
there
could
be
an
american
lisa
that
the
charm
of
these
russian
tragedies
you
feel
that
they
so
perfectly
true
there
and
so
perfectly
impossible
here
lavretsky
would
simply
have
got
himself
divorced
from
varvara
pavlovna
and
no
clergyman
could
have
objected
to
marrying
him
to
that
what
i
mean
by
his
pessimism
said
miss
cotton
he
leaves
you
no
hope
and
i
think
that
despair
should
never
be
used
in
a
novel
except
for
some
good
purpose
do
you
brinkley
well
said
brinkley
i
was
trying
to
think
what
good
purpose
despair
could
be
put
to
in
a
book
or
out
of
i
do
think
said
pasmer
referring
to
the
book
in
her
lap
that
he
leaves
you
altogether
in
despair
here
unless
you
rather
run
off
with
irene
than
married
oh
i
certainly
did
wish
that
said
miss
cotton
in
as
if
the
shot
had
been
aimed
at
her
the
book
ends
with
a
marriage
there
no
denying
that
said
brinkley
with
a
reserve
in
her
tone
which
caused
pasmer
to
continue
for
her
and
marriage
means
happiness
in
a
i
not
sure
that
it
does
in
this
case
the
time
would
come
after
litvinof
had
told
tatiana
everything
when
she
would
have
to
ask
herself
and
not
once
only
what
sort
of
man
it
really
was
who
was
willing
to
break
his
engagement
and
run
off
with
another
man
wife
and
whether
he
could
ever
repent
enough
for
it
she
could
make
excuses
for
him
and
would
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
no
it
seems
to
me
that
there
almost
for
the
only
time
tourguenief
permitted
himself
an
amiable
weakness
all
that
part
of
the
book
has
the
air
of
begging
the
but
do
you
see
said
miss
cotton
leaning
forward
in
the
way
she
had
when
very
earnest
that
he
means
to
show
that
her
love
is
strong
enough
for
all
that
but
he
does
because
it
is
love
is
strong
enough
to
save
people
from
unhappiness
through
each
other
faults
do
you
suppose
that
so
many
married
people
are
unhappy
in
each
other
because
they
do
love
each
other
no
it
because
they
do
love
each
other
that
their
faults
are
such
a
mutual
torment
if
they
were
indifferent
they
would
mind
each
other
faults
perhaps
that
the
reason
why
there
are
so
many
american
divorces
if
they
did
care
like
europeans
who
do
marry
for
love
they
could
stand
then
the
moral
is
said
pasmer
at
her
lightest
through
the
surrounding
gravity
that
as
all
americans
marry
for
love
only
americans
who
have
been
very
good
ought
to
get
i
not
sure
that
the
goodness
is
enough
either
said
brinkley
willing
to
push
it
to
the
absurd
you
marry
a
man
future
as
well
as
his
dear
me
you
are
terribly
exigeante
brinkley
said
pasmer
one
can
afford
to
be
so
in
the
abstract
answered
brinkley
they
all
stopped
talking
and
looked
at
john
munt
who
was
coming
toward
them
and
each
felt
a
longing
to
lay
the
matter
before
him
there
was
probably
not
a
woman
among
them
but
had
felt
more
read
more
and
thought
more
than
john
munt
but
he
was
a
man
and
the
mind
of
a
man
is
the
court
of
final
appeal
for
the
wisest
women
till
some
man
has
pronounced
upon
their
wisdom
they
do
not
know
whether
it
is
wisdom
or
not
munt
drew
up
his
chair
and
addressed
himself
to
the
whole
group
through
pasmer
we
are
thinking
of
getting
up
a
little
picnic
xiv
the
day
of
the
picnic
struggled
till
ten
to
peer
through
the
fog
that
wrapt
it
with
that
remote
damp
and
coolness
and
that
nearer
drouth
and
warmth
which
some
fogs
have
the
low
pine
groves
hung
full
of
it
and
it
gave
a
silvery
definition
to
the
gossamer
threads
running
from
one
grass
spear
to
another
in
spacious
networks
over
the
open
levels
of
the
old
fields
that
stretch
back
from
the
bluff
to
the
woods
at
last
it
grew
thinner
somewhere
over
the
bay
then
you
could
see
the
smooth
water
through
it
then
it
drifted
off
in
ragged
fringes
before
a
light
breeze
when
you
looked
landward
again
it
was
all
gone
there
and
seaward
it
had
gathered
itself
in
a
low
dun
bank
along
the
horizon
it
was
the
kind
of
fog
that
people
interested
in
campobello
admitted
as
apt
to
be
common
there
but
claimed
as
a
kind
of
local
virtue
when
it
began
to
break
away
they
said
that
it
was
a
very
dry
fog
not
like
newport
and
asked
you
to
notice
that
it
did
not
wet
you
at
all
four
or
five
carriages
driven
by
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
held
the
picnic
which
was
destined
for
that
beautiful
cove
on
the
bay
of
fundy
where
the
red
granite
ledges
by
ages
of
storm
and
sun
lend
themselves
to
such
festivities
as
if
they
had
been
artificially
fashioned
into
shelves
and
tables
the
whole
place
is
yet
so
new
to
men
that
this
haunt
has
not
acquired
that
air
of
repulsive
custom
which
the
egg
shells
and
broken
bottles
and
sardine
boxes
of
many
seasons
give
or
perhaps
the
winter
tempests
heap
the
tides
of
the
bay
over
the
ledge
and
wash
it
clean
of
these
vulgar
traces
of
human
resort
and
enable
it
to
offer
as
fresh
a
welcome
to
the
picnics
of
each
successive
summer
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
picnic
in
that
place
before
this
was
the
sense
that
mavering
professed
to
have
received
from
it
when
he
jumped
out
of
the
beach
wagon
in
which
he
had
preceded
the
other
carriages
through
the
weird
forest
lying
between
the
fringe
of
farm
fields
and
on
the
western
shore
of
the
island
and
these
lonely
coasts
of
the
bay
as
far
as
the
signs
of
settled
human
habitation
last
the
road
is
the
good
hard
country
road
of
new
england
climbing
steep
little
hills
and
presently
leading
through
long
tracts
of
woodland
but
at
a
certain
point
beyond
the
furthest
cottage
you
leave
it
and
plunge
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
vaguely
traversed
by
the
carried
through
since
the
island
was
opened
to
summer
sojourn
road
you
can
hardly
call
it
remembering
its
curious
pauses
and
hesitations
when
confronted
with
stretches
of
marshy
ground
and
its
staggering
progress
over
the
thick
stubble
of
saplings
through
which
it
is
cut
the
progress
of
teams
over
it
is
slow
but
there
is
such
joy
of
wildness
in
the
solitudes
it
penetrates
that
if
the
horses
had
any
gait
slower
than
a
walk
one
might
still
wish
to
stay
them
it
is
a
northern
forest
with
the
air
of
having
sprang
quickly
up
in
the
fierce
heat
and
haste
of
the
northern
summers
the
small
firs
are
set
almost
as
dense
as
rye
in
a
field
and
in
their
struggle
to
the
light
they
have
choked
one
another
so
that
there
is
a
strange
blight
of
death
and
defeat
on
all
that
vigour
of
life
few
of
the
trees
have
won
any
lofty
growth
they
seem
to
have
died
and
fallen
when
they
were
about
to
outstrip
the
others
in
size
and
from
their
decay
a
new
sylvan
generation
riots
rankly
upward
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
thinly
clothed
with
a
deciduous
undergrowth
above
which
are
the
bare
spare
stems
of
the
evergreens
and
then
their
limbs
thrusting
into
one
another
in
a
sombre
tangle
with
locks
of
long
moss
like
the
grey
pendants
of
the
southern
pines
dripping
from
them
and
draining
their
brief
life
in
such
a
place
you
must
surrender
yourself
to
its
influences
profoundly
yet
vaguely
melancholy
or
you
must
resist
them
with
whatever
gaiety
is
in
you
or
may
be
conjured
out
of
others
it
was
conceded
that
mavering
was
the
life
of
the
party
as
the
phrase
goes
his
as
kindly
and
sympathetic
as
it
was
inexhaustible
served
to
carry
them
over
the
worst
places
in
the
road
of
itself
he
jumped
down
and
ran
back
when
he
had
passed
a
bad
bit
to
see
if
the
others
were
getting
through
safely
the
least
interesting
of
the
party
had
some
proof
of
his
impartial
friendliness
he
promised
an
early
and
triumphant
emergence
from
all
difficulties
he
started
singing
and
sacrificed
himself
in
several
tunes
for
he
could
not
sing
well
his
laugh
seemed
to
be
always
coming
back
to
alice
where
she
rode
late
in
the
little
procession
several
times
with
the
deference
which
he
delicately
qualified
for
her
he
came
himself
to
see
if
he
could
not
do
something
for
her
miss
pasmer
croaked
her
friend
miss
anderson
who
always
began
in
that
ceremonious
way
with
her
and
got
to
calling
her
alice
further
along
in
the
conversation
if
you
do
drop
something
for
that
poor
fellow
to
run
back
two
or
three
miles
and
get
pretty
soon
i
do
it
myself
it
peyfectly
disheaytening
to
see
his
disappointment
when
you
tell
him
theye
nothing
to
be
he
seems
to
get
over
it
said
alice
evasively
she
smiled
with
pleasure
in
miss
anderson
impeachment
however
oh
he
keeps
coming
if
that
what
you
mean
but
do
drop
an
umbrella
or
a
rubber
or
something
next
time
just
to
show
a
proper
but
mavering
did
not
come
any
more
just
before
they
got
to
the
cove
miss
anderson
leaned
over
again
to
whisper
in
alice
ear
i
told
you
he
was
huyt
now
you
must
be
very
good
to
him
the
rest
of
the
upon
theory
a
girl
of
alice
pasmer
reserve
ought
to
have
resented
this
intervention
but
it
is
not
probable
she
did
she
flushed
a
little
but
not
with
offence
apparently
and
she
was
kinder
to
mavering
and
let
him
do
everything
for
her
that
he
could
invent
in
transferring
the
things
from
the
wagons
to
the
rocks
the
party
gave
a
gaiety
to
the
wild
place
which
accented
its
proper
charm
as
they
scattered
themselves
over
the
ledges
on
the
bright
shawls
spread
upon
the
level
spaces
on
either
hand
craggy
bluffs
hemmed
the
cove
in
but
below
the
ledge
it
had
a
pebbly
beach
strewn
with
and
the
bay
of
fundy
gloomed
before
it
with
small
fishing
craft
tipping
and
tilting
on
the
swell
in
the
foreground
and
dim
sail
melting
into
the
dun
fog
bank
at
the
horizon
edge
the
elder
ladies
of
the
party
stood
up
or
stretched
themselves
on
the
shawls
as
they
found
this
or
that
posture
more
restful
after
their
long
drive
one
who
was
skilled
in
making
coffee
had
taken
possession
of
the
pot
and
was
demanding
fire
and
water
for
it
the
men
scattered
themselves
over
the
beach
and
brought
her
drift
enough
to
roast
an
ox
two
of
them
fetched
water
from
the
spring
at
the
back
of
the
ledge
whither
they
then
carried
the
bottles
of
ale
to
cool
in
its
thrilling
pool
each
after
his
or
her
fashion
symbolised
a
return
to
nature
by
some
act
or
word
of
you
ought
to
have
brought
heavier
shoes
said
pasmer
with
a
serious
glance
at
her
daughter
feet
well
never
mind
she
added
it
does
matter
if
you
do
spoil
really
cried
mrs
brinkley
casting
her
sandals
from
her
i
will
not
be
enslaved
to
rubbers
in
such
a
sylvan
scene
as
this
at
any
look
at
stamwell
said
miss
cotton
she
actually
taken
her
hat
stamwell
had
not
only
gone
to
this
extreme
but
had
tied
a
lightly
fluttering
handkerchief
round
her
hair
she
said
she
should
certainly
not
put
on
that
heavy
thing
again
till
she
got
in
sight
of
civilisation
at
these
words
miss
cotton
boldly
drew
off
her
gloves
and
put
them
in
her
pocket
the
young
girls
slim
in
their
blues
flannel
skirts
and
their
broad
white
canvas
belts
went
and
came
over
the
rocks
there
were
some
children
in
the
party
who
were
allowed
to
scream
uninterruptedly
in
the
games
which
they
began
to
play
as
soon
as
they
found
their
feet
after
getting
out
of
the
wagons
some
of
the
gentlemen
drove
a
stake
into
the
beach
and
threw
stones
at
it
to
see
which
could
knock
off
the
pebble
balanced
on
its
top
several
of
the
ladies
joined
them
in
the
sport
and
shrieked
and
laughed
when
they
made
wild
shots
with
the
missiles
the
men
politely
gathered
for
them
alice
had
remained
with
mavering
to
help
the
hostess
of
the
picnic
lay
the
tables
but
her
mother
had
followed
those
who
went
down
to
the
beach
at
first
pasmer
looked
on
at
the
practice
of
the
with
disapproval
but
suddenly
she
let
herself
go
in
this
as
she
did
in
other
matters
that
her
judgment
condemned
and
began
to
throw
stones
herself
she
became
excited
and
made
the
wildest
shots
of
any
accepting
missiles
right
and
left
and
making
herself
dangerous
to
everybody
within
a
wide
circle
a
gentleman
who
had
fallen
a
victim
to
her
skill
said
just
wait
pasmer
till
i
get
in
front
of
the
the
men
became
seriously
interested
and
worked
themselves
red
and
hot
the
ladies
soon
gave
it
up
and
sat
down
on
the
sand
and
began
to
talk
they
all
owned
themselves
hungry
and
from
time
to
time
they
looked
up
anxiously
at
the
preparations
for
lunch
on
the
ledge
where
white
napkins
were
spread
with
bottles
at
the
four
corners
to
keep
them
from
blowing
away
this
use
of
the
bottles
was
considered
very
amusing
the
ladies
tried
to
make
jokes
about
it
and
the
desire
to
be
funny
spread
to
certain
of
the
men
who
had
quietly
left
off
throwing
at
the
stake
because
they
had
wrenched
their
shoulders
they
succeeded
in
being
merry
they
said
they
thought
that
coffee
took
a
long
time
to
boil
a
lull
of
expectation
fell
upon
all
even
mavering
sat
down
on
the
rocks
near
the
fire
and
was
at
rest
a
few
minutes
by
order
of
miss
anderson
who
said
that
the
sight
of
his
activity
tired
her
to
death
i
wonder
why
always
boiled
ham
at
a
picnic
said
the
lady
who
took
a
final
plate
of
it
from
a
basket
under
the
ordinary
conditions
few
of
us
can
be
persuaded
to
touch
it
seems
to
be
dear
to
nature
and
to
nature
children
said
brinkley
perhaps
because
their
digestions
are
do
you
wish
that
something
could
be
substituted
for
it
asked
miss
cotton
there
have
been
efforts
to
replace
it
with
chicken
and
tongue
in
sandwiches
said
brinkley
but
i
think
they
only
measurably
succeeded
about
as
temperance
drinks
have
in
place
of
the
real
strong
on
the
boat
coming
up
said
mavering
we
had
a
troupe
of
genuine
darky
minstrels
one
of
them
sang
a
song
about
ham
that
rather
took
me
good
old
ham
ham
is
de
best
ob
meat
it
always
good
and
sweet
you
can
bake
it
you
can
boil
it
you
can
fry
it
you
can
broil
it
ham
good
old
ham
oh
how
good
sighed
brinkley
how
sincere
how
native
go
on
mavering
for
i
have
the
materials
said
mavering
with
his
laugh
the
rest
was
da
capo
but
there
was
another
song
about
a
coloured
lady
foot
high
and
eight
foot
round
holler
ob
her
foot
made
a
hole
in
de
ground
ah
that
an
old
friend
said
brinkley
i
remember
hearing
of
that
coloured
lady
when
i
was
a
girl
but
it
a
fine
flight
of
the
imagination
what
else
did
they
sing
i
ca
remember
but
there
was
something
they
danced
to
show
how
a
rheumatic
old
coloured
uncle
he
jumped
nimbly
up
and
sketched
the
stiff
and
limping
figure
he
had
seen
it
was
over
in
a
flash
he
dropped
down
again
laughing
oh
how
wonderfully
good
cried
brinkley
with
frank
joy
do
it
encore
oh
encore
came
from
the
people
on
the
beach
mavering
jumped
to
his
feet
and
burlesqued
the
profuse
bows
of
an
actor
who
refuses
to
repeat
he
was
about
to
drop
down
again
amidst
their
wails
of
protest
no
do
sit
down
mavering
said
the
lady
who
had
introduced
the
subject
of
ham
get
some
of
the
young
ladies
and
go
and
gather
some
blueberries
for
the
dessert
there
are
all
the
necessaries
of
life
here
but
none
of
the
i
at
the
service
of
the
young
ladies
as
an
escort
said
mavering
gallantly
with
an
infusion
of
joke
will
you
come
and
pick
blueberries
under
my
watchful
eyes
miss
pasmer
they
gone
to
pick
blueberries
called
the
lady
through
her
tubed
hand
to
the
people
on
the
beach
and
the
younger
among
them
scrambled
up
the
rocks
for
cups
and
bowls
to
follow
them
pasmer
had
an
impulse
to
call
her
daughter
back
and
to
make
some
excuse
to
keep
her
from
going
she
was
in
an
access
of
decorum
naturally
following
upon
her
late
outbreak
and
it
seemed
a
very
pronounced
thing
for
alice
to
be
going
off
into
the
woods
with
the
young
man
but
it
would
have
been
a
pronounced
thing
to
prevent
her
and
so
pasmer
submitted
is
it
delightful
asked
brinkley
following
them
with
her
eyes
to
see
the
charm
that
gay
young
fellow
has
for
that
serious
girl
she
looked
at
him
while
he
was
dancing
as
if
she
could
take
her
eyes
off
him
and
she
followed
him
as
if
he
drew
her
by
an
invisible
spell
not
that
spells
are
ever
visible
she
added
saving
herself
though
this
one
seems
to
be
she
added
further
again
saving
herself
do
you
really
think
so
pleaded
miss
cotton
well
i
say
so
whatever
i
think
and
i
not
going
to
be
caught
up
on
the
of
conscience
as
to
all
my
meanings
miss
cotton
i
do
know
them
all
but
i
not
one
of
the
aliceolaters
you
no
of
course
not
but
should
you
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
great
pity
she
so
superior
so
very
uncommon
in
every
way
that
it
hardly
seems
ah
i
should
so
like
to
see
some
one
really
fine
not
a
coarse
fibre
in
him
do
you
know
not
that
mavering
coarse
but
beside
her
he
does
seem
so
light
perhaps
that
the
reason
she
likes
no
no
i
ca
believe
that
she
must
see
more
in
him
than
we
i
dare
say
she
thinks
she
does
at
any
rate
it
a
perfectly
evident
case
on
both
sides
and
the
frank
way
he
followed
her
up
here
and
devoted
himself
to
her
as
if
well
not
as
if
she
were
the
only
girl
in
the
world
but
incomparably
the
best
is
certainly
not
no
sighed
miss
cotton
glad
to
admit
it
that
xv
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
the
open
spaces
among
the
trees
the
blueberries
grew
larger
and
sweeter
in
the
late
northern
summer
than
a
more
southern
sun
seems
to
make
them
they
hung
dense
upon
the
low
bushes
and
gave
them
their
tint
through
the
soft
grey
bloom
that
veiled
their
blue
in
patches
broke
their
mass
here
and
there
and
exhaled
its
wild
perfume
to
the
foot
or
skirt
brushing
through
it
i
do
think
there
anything
much
prettier
than
these
clusters
do
you
miss
pasmer
asked
mavering
as
he
lifted
a
bunch
pendent
from
the
little
tree
before
he
stripped
it
into
the
bowl
he
carried
and
see
it
spoils
the
bloom
to
gather
he
held
out
a
handful
and
then
tossed
them
away
it
ought
to
be
managed
more
aesthetically
for
an
occasion
like
this
i
tell
you
what
miss
pasmer
are
you
used
to
blueberrying
no
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
ever
went
blueberrying
before
why
she
asked
because
if
you
have
you
would
be
very
efficient
perhaps
and
so
you
might
resign
yourself
to
sitting
on
that
log
and
holding
the
berries
in
your
lap
while
i
pick
but
what
about
the
bowls
then
oh
never
mind
them
i
got
an
idea
see
here
he
clipped
off
a
bunch
with
his
knife
and
held
it
up
before
her
tilting
it
this
way
and
that
could
anything
be
more
graceful
my
idea
is
to
serve
the
blueberry
on
its
native
stem
at
this
picnic
what
do
you
think
sugar
would
profane
it
and
of
course
they
only
got
milk
enough
for
the
delightful
alice
arranged
herself
on
the
log
and
made
a
lap
for
the
bunch
he
would
not
allow
that
the
arrangement
was
perfect
till
he
had
cushioned
the
seat
and
carpeted
the
ground
for
her
feet
with
now
you
something
like
a
he
laughed
only
would
a
real
have
an
apron
he
asked
looking
down
at
her
dress
oh
it
wo
hurt
the
dress
you
must
begin
now
or
they
be
calling
he
was
standing
and
gazing
at
her
with
a
distracted
enjoyment
of
her
pose
oh
yes
yes
he
answered
coming
to
himself
and
he
set
about
his
work
he
might
have
got
on
faster
if
he
had
not
come
to
her
with
nearly
every
bunch
he
cut
at
first
and
when
he
began
to
deny
himself
this
pleasure
he
stopped
to
admire
an
idea
of
hers
well
that
charming
making
them
into
yes
is
it
she
cried
delightedly
holding
a
bunch
of
the
berries
up
at
to
get
the
effect
ah
but
you
must
have
some
of
this
fern
and
this
tall
grass
to
go
with
it
why
it
the
of
the
indian
baskets
is
it
she
looked
up
at
him
and
do
you
think
that
the
mixture
would
be
better
than
the
modest
simplicity
of
the
berries
with
a
few
leaves
of
the
same
no
you
right
it
would
he
said
throwing
away
his
ferns
but
you
want
something
to
tie
the
stems
with
you
must
use
the
he
left
that
with
her
and
went
back
to
his
bushes
he
added
from
beyond
a
little
thicket
as
if
what
he
said
were
part
of
the
subject
i
was
afraid
you
would
like
my
skipping
about
there
on
the
rocks
doing
the
coloured
like
it
i
mean
i
you
thought
it
undignified
trivial
she
said
after
a
moment
it
was
very
funny
and
people
do
all
sorts
of
things
at
picnics
that
the
pleasure
of
it
is
it
yes
it
is
but
i
know
you
do
always
like
that
kind
of
do
i
seem
so
very
severe
she
asked
oh
no
not
severe
i
should
be
afraid
of
you
if
you
were
i
have
dared
to
come
to
he
looked
at
her
across
the
blueberry
bushes
his
gay
speech
meant
everything
or
nothing
she
could
parry
it
with
a
jest
and
then
it
would
mean
nothing
she
let
her
head
droop
over
her
work
and
made
no
answer
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
those
fellows
on
the
boat
said
mavering
hello
mavering
called
the
voice
of
john
munt
from
another
part
of
the
woods
alice
miss
pasmer
came
that
of
miss
anderson
he
was
going
to
answer
when
he
looked
at
alice
we
let
them
see
if
they
can
find
us
he
said
and
smiled
alice
said
nothing
at
first
she
smiled
too
you
know
more
about
the
woods
than
i
do
i
suppose
if
they
keep
looking
oh
he
came
toward
her
with
a
mass
of
clusters
which
he
had
clipped
how
fast
you
do
them
he
said
standing
and
looking
down
at
her
i
wish
you
let
me
come
and
make
up
the
withes
for
you
when
you
need
no
i
could
allow
that
on
any
account
she
answered
twisting
some
stems
of
the
grass
together
well
will
you
let
me
hold
the
bunches
while
you
tie
them
or
tie
them
when
you
hold
them
this
once
then
this
once
how
little
you
let
me
do
for
you
he
sighed
that
gives
you
a
chance
to
do
more
for
other
people
she
answered
and
then
she
dropped
her
eyes
as
if
she
had
been
surprised
into
that
answer
she
made
haste
to
add
that
what
makes
you
so
popular
with
everybody
ah
but
i
rather
be
popular
with
somebody
he
laughed
and
then
they
both
laughed
together
consciously
and
still
nothing
or
everything
had
been
said
a
little
silly
silence
followed
and
he
said
for
escape
from
it
i
never
saw
such
berries
before
even
in
september
on
the
top
of
why
is
it
a
mountain
she
asked
i
thought
it
was
a
it
both
he
said
i
suppose
it
very
beautiful
is
it
all
america
seems
so
lovely
so
it
pretty
in
the
summer
i
do
know
that
i
shall
like
it
there
in
the
winter
if
i
conclude
to
did
your
did
pasmer
tell
you
what
my
father
wants
me
to
do
about
going
there
to
manufacture
mavering
nodded
he
given
me
three
weeks
to
decide
whether
i
would
like
to
do
that
or
go
in
for
law
that
what
i
came
up
here
there
was
a
little
pause
she
bent
her
head
down
over
the
clusters
she
was
grouping
is
the
light
of
campobello
particularly
good
on
such
questions
she
asked
i
do
mean
that
exactly
but
i
wish
you
could
help
me
to
some
yes
why
not
it
the
first
time
i
ever
had
a
business
question
referred
to
well
then
you
can
bring
a
perfectly
fresh
mind
to
let
me
see
she
said
affecting
to
consider
it
really
a
very
important
matter
it
is
to
after
a
moment
she
looked
up
at
him
i
should
think
that
you
mind
living
there
if
your
business
was
there
i
suppose
it
being
idle
in
places
that
makes
them
dull
i
thought
it
was
dull
in
london
one
ought
to
be
glad
ought
he
to
live
in
any
place
where
something
to
well
that
is
the
way
people
usually
feel
said
mavering
the
kind
of
a
place
most
of
them
fight
shy
alice
laughed
with
an
undercurrent
of
protest
perhaps
because
she
had
seen
her
parents
whole
life
so
far
as
she
knew
it
passed
in
this
sort
of
struggle
i
mean
that
i
hate
my
own
life
because
there
seems
nothing
for
me
to
do
with
it
i
like
to
have
people
do
do
you
really
asked
mavering
soberly
as
if
struck
by
the
novelty
of
the
idea
yes
she
said
with
exaltation
if
i
were
a
man
he
burst
into
a
ringing
laugh
oh
no
do
why
she
demanded
with
provisional
indignation
because
then
there
would
be
any
miss
it
seemed
to
alice
that
this
joking
was
rather
an
unwarranted
liberty
again
she
could
not
help
joining
in
his
but
she
checked
herself
so
abruptly
and
put
on
a
look
so
austere
that
he
was
quelled
by
it
i
mean
he
began
that
is
to
say
i
mean
that
i
do
understand
why
ladies
are
always
saying
that
i
am
sure
they
can
do
what
they
like
as
it
do
you
mean
that
everything
is
open
to
them
now
she
asked
disentangling
a
cluster
of
the
berries
from
those
in
her
lap
and
beginning
a
fresh
bunch
yes
said
mavering
something
like
that
yes
they
can
do
anything
they
like
lots
of
them
oh
yes
i
know
said
the
girl
but
people
do
like
them
why
what
would
you
like
to
be
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
but
sorted
over
the
clusters
in
her
lap
we
got
enough
now
have
we
she
said
oh
not
half
he
said
but
if
you
tired
you
must
let
me
make
up
some
of
the
no
no
i
want
to
do
them
all
myself
she
said
gesturing
his
offered
hands
away
with
a
little
nether
appeal
in
her
laughing
refusal
so
as
to
feel
that
you
been
of
some
use
in
the
world
he
said
dropping
contentedly
on
the
ground
near
her
and
watching
her
industry
do
you
think
that
would
be
very
wrong
she
asked
what
made
that
friend
of
yours
boardman
go
into
journalism
oh
virtuous
poverty
you
not
thinking
of
becoming
a
newspaper
woman
miss
pasmer
why
not
she
put
the
final
cluster
into
the
bunch
in
hand
and
began
to
wind
a
withe
of
around
the
stems
he
dropped
forward
on
his
knees
to
help
her
and
together
they
managed
the
knot
they
were
both
flushed
a
little
when
it
was
tied
and
were
serious
why
should
one
be
a
newspaper
woman
if
harvard
graduates
are
to
be
journalists
well
you
know
only
a
certain
kind
what
kind
well
not
exactly
what
you
call
the
gentlemanly
i
thought
boardman
was
a
great
friend
of
yours
he
is
he
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
but
you
must
have
seen
that
he
was
a
i
should
think
he
be
glad
he
was
doing
something
at
once
if
i
were
a
she
stopped
and
they
laughed
together
i
mean
that
i
should
hate
to
be
so
long
getting
ready
to
do
something
as
men
then
you
rather
begin
making
at
once
than
studying
law
oh
i
do
say
that
i
not
competent
to
advise
but
i
should
like
to
feel
that
i
was
doing
something
i
suppose
it
mavering
stared
a
little
one
of
my
father
sisters
has
gone
into
a
sisterhood
she
in
is
she
a
catholic
asked
mavering
she
is
a
roman
oh
yes
he
dropped
forward
on
his
knees
again
to
help
her
tie
the
bunch
she
had
finished
it
was
not
so
easy
as
the
first
oh
thank
you
she
said
with
unnecessary
fervour
but
you
should
like
to
go
into
a
sisterhood
i
suppose
said
mavering
ready
to
laugh
oh
i
do
know
why
not
she
looked
at
him
with
a
flying
glance
and
dropped
her
eyes
oh
no
reason
if
you
have
a
fancy
for
that
kind
of
that
kind
of
thing
repeated
alice
severely
oh
i
do
mean
anything
disrespectful
to
it
said
mavering
throwing
his
anxiety
off
in
the
laugh
he
had
been
holding
back
and
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
do
suppose
you
in
oh
no
i
not
in
earnest
said
the
girl
letting
her
wrists
fall
upon
her
knees
and
the
clusters
drop
from
her
hands
i
not
in
earnest
about
anything
that
the
truth
that
the
shame
would
you
like
she
broke
off
to
be
a
priest
and
go
round
among
these
people
up
here
on
their
frozen
islands
in
the
winter
no
shouted
mavering
i
certainly
should
i
do
see
how
anybody
stands
it
ponkwasset
falls
is
bad
enough
in
the
winter
and
compared
to
this
region
ponkwasset
falls
is
a
metropolis
i
believe
in
getting
all
the
good
you
can
out
of
the
world
you
were
born
in
of
course
without
hurting
anybody
he
stretched
his
legs
out
on
the
bed
of
where
he
had
thrown
himself
and
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
lifted
on
his
elbow
i
think
this
is
what
this
place
is
fit
for
a
picnic
and
i
wish
every
one
well
out
of
it
for
nine
months
of
the
i
do
said
the
girl
with
a
passionate
regret
in
her
voice
it
would
be
heavenly
here
with
but
you
no
you
different
you
always
want
to
share
your
i
should
call
that
happiness
but
do
you
asked
mavering
no
i
you
do
expect
me
to
be
believe
that
i
yes
she
went
on
it
must
be
selfishness
you
do
believe
i
so
because
you
ca
imagine
it
but
it
true
if
i
were
to
be
happy
i
should
be
very
greedy
about
it
i
could
endure
to
let
any
one
else
have
a
part
in
it
so
it
best
for
me
to
be
wretched
do
you
see
to
give
myself
up
entirely
to
doing
for
others
and
not
expect
any
one
to
do
anything
for
me
then
i
can
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
that
why
i
should
like
to
go
into
a
mavering
treated
it
as
the
best
kind
of
joke
and
he
was
confirmed
in
this
view
of
it
by
her
laughing
with
him
after
a
first
glance
of
what
he
thought
mock
piteousness
xvi
the
clouds
sailed
across
the
irregular
space
of
pale
blue
northern
sky
which
the
break
in
the
woods
opened
for
them
overhead
it
was
so
still
that
they
heard
and
smiled
to
hear
the
broken
voices
of
the
others
who
had
gone
to
get
berries
in
another
direction
miss
anderson
hoarse
murmur
and
munt
artificial
bass
some
words
came
from
the
party
on
the
rocks
is
it
perfect
cried
the
young
fellow
in
utter
content
yes
too
perfect
answered
the
girl
rousing
herself
from
the
reverie
in
which
they
had
both
lost
themselves
she
did
not
know
how
long
shall
you
gather
any
more
no
i
guess
there
enough
let
count
he
stooped
over
on
his
hand
and
knees
and
made
as
much
of
counting
the
bunches
as
he
could
there
about
one
bunch
and
a
half
a
piece
how
shall
we
carry
them
we
ought
to
come
into
camp
as
impressively
as
yes
said
alice
looking
into
his
face
with
dreamy
absence
it
was
going
through
her
mind
from
some
romance
she
had
read
what
if
he
were
some
sylvan
creature
with
that
gaiety
that
natural
gladness
and
sweetness
of
his
so
far
from
any
happiness
that
was
possible
to
her
ought
not
she
to
be
afraid
of
him
she
was
thinking
she
was
not
afraid
i
tell
you
he
said
tie
the
stems
of
all
the
bunches
together
and
swing
them
over
a
pole
like
grapes
of
eshcol
do
you
know
the
picture
oh
hold
on
i
get
the
he
cut
a
white
birch
sapling
and
swept
off
its
twigs
and
leaves
then
he
tied
the
bunches
together
and
slung
them
over
the
middle
of
the
pole
well
she
asked
now
we
must
rest
the
ends
on
our
do
you
think
so
she
asked
with
the
reluctance
that
complies
yes
but
not
right
away
i
carry
them
out
of
the
woods
and
form
the
procession
just
before
we
come
in
every
one
on
the
ledge
recognised
the
tableau
when
it
appeared
and
saluted
it
with
cheers
and
pasmer
bent
a
look
on
her
daughter
which
she
faced
impenetrably
where
have
you
been
we
thought
you
were
lost
we
were
just
organising
a
search
expedition
different
ones
shouted
at
them
the
lady
with
the
was
kneeling
over
it
with
her
hand
on
it
have
some
coffee
you
poor
things
you
must
be
almost
we
looked
about
for
you
everywhere
said
munt
and
shouted
ourselves
miss
anderson
passed
near
alice
i
knew
where
you
were
all
the
time
then
the
whole
party
fell
to
praising
the
novel
conception
of
the
bouquets
of
blueberries
and
the
talk
began
to
flow
away
from
alice
and
mavering
in
various
channels
all
that
had
happened
a
few
minutes
ago
in
the
blueberry
patch
seemed
a
dream
the
reality
had
died
out
of
the
looks
and
words
he
ran
about
from
one
to
another
serving
every
one
in
a
little
while
the
whole
affair
was
in
his
hospitable
hands
and
his
laugh
interspersed
and
brightened
the
talk
she
got
a
little
back
of
the
others
and
sat
looking
wistfully
out
over
the
bay
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
hold
on
just
half
a
minute
miss
pasmer
do
move
exclaimed
the
amateur
photographer
who
is
now
of
all
excursions
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
ran
for
his
apparatus
she
sat
still
to
please
him
but
when
he
had
developed
his
picture
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
rocks
roofed
with
a
waterproof
he
accused
her
of
having
changed
her
position
but
going
to
be
splendid
he
said
with
another
look
at
it
he
took
several
pictures
of
the
whole
party
for
which
they
fell
into
various
attitudes
of
consciousness
then
he
shouted
to
a
of
sailors
who
had
beached
their
craft
while
they
gathered
some
drift
for
their
galley
fire
they
had
flung
their
into
the
boat
and
had
bent
themselves
to
shove
it
into
the
water
keep
still
do
move
he
yelled
at
them
with
the
imperiousness
of
the
amateur
photographer
and
they
obeyed
with
the
helplessness
of
his
victims
but
they
looked
round
oh
idiots
groaned
the
artist
i
always
wonder
what
that
kind
of
people
think
of
us
kind
of
people
said
brinkley
with
her
eye
on
the
photographer
subjects
yes
i
wonder
what
they
do
said
miss
cotton
pleased
with
the
speculative
turn
which
the
talk
might
take
from
this
i
suppose
they
envy
us
she
suggested
well
not
all
of
them
and
those
that
do
not
respectfully
they
view
us
as
the
possessors
of
gains
who
would
be
in
a
very
different
place
if
we
had
our
do
you
really
think
so
yes
i
think
so
but
i
do
know
that
i
really
think
so
another
matter
said
brinkley
with
the
whimsical
resentment
which
miss
cotton
conscientious
pursuit
seemed
always
to
rouse
in
her
i
supposed
continued
miss
cotton
that
it
was
only
among
the
poor
in
the
cities
who
have
begin
misled
by
agitators
that
classes
were
regarded
with
it
seems
to
have
begun
a
great
while
ago
said
brinkley
and
not
exactly
with
agitators
it
was
considered
very
difficult
for
us
to
get
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
you
yes
i
know
assented
miss
cotton
and
there
certainly
are
some
things
against
us
even
when
the
chance
was
given
us
to
sell
all
we
had
and
give
it
to
the
poor
we
bring
our
minds
to
it
and
went
away
exceeding
i
wonder
said
miss
cotton
whether
those
things
were
ever
intended
to
be
taken
literally
let
hope
not
said
john
munt
seeing
his
chance
to
make
a
laugh
stamwell
said
well
i
shall
take
another
cup
of
coffee
at
any
rate
and
her
hardihood
raised
another
laugh
that
always
seems
to
me
the
most
pitiful
thing
in
the
whole
bible
said
alice
from
her
place
to
see
the
right
so
clearly
and
not
to
be
strong
enough
to
do
my
dear
it
happens
every
day
said
brinkley
i
always
felt
sorry
for
that
poor
fellow
too
said
mavering
he
seemed
to
be
a
good
fellow
and
it
was
pretty
hard
lines
for
alice
looked
round
at
him
with
deepening
gravity
confound
those
fellows
said
the
photographer
glancing
at
his
hastily
developed
plate
they
xvii
the
picnic
party
gathered
itself
up
after
the
lunch
and
while
some
of
the
men
emulous
of
mavering
public
spirit
helped
some
of
the
ladies
to
pack
the
dishes
and
baskets
away
under
the
wagon
seats
others
threw
a
corked
bottle
into
the
water
and
threw
stones
at
it
a
few
of
the
ladies
joined
them
but
nobody
hit
the
bottle
which
was
finally
left
bobbing
about
on
the
tide
brinkley
addressed
the
defeated
group
of
whom
her
husband
was
one
as
they
came
up
the
beach
toward
the
wagons
do
you
think
that
display
was
calculated
to
inspire
the
lower
middle
classes
with
respectful
envy
her
husband
made
himself
spokesman
for
the
rest
no
but
you
ca
tell
how
they
have
felt
if
we
hit
they
all
now
climbed
to
a
higher
level
grassy
and
smooth
on
the
bluff
from
which
there
was
a
particular
view
and
mavering
came
carrying
the
wraps
of
pasmer
and
alice
with
which
he
associated
his
overcoat
a
book
fell
out
of
one
of
the
pockets
when
he
threw
it
down
miss
anderson
picked
the
volume
up
browning
he
reads
browning
superior
young
man
oh
do
say
that
pleaded
mavering
oh
read
something
aloud
cried
another
of
the
young
ladies
is
browning
rather
serious
for
a
picnic
he
asked
with
a
glance
at
alice
he
still
had
a
doubt
of
the
effect
of
the
rheumatic
uncle
dance
upon
her
and
would
have
been
glad
to
give
her
some
other
aesthetic
impression
of
him
oh
no
said
brinkley
nothing
is
more
appropriate
to
a
picnic
than
conundrums
they
always
have
them
choose
a
good
tough
i
do
know
anything
tougher
than
the
of
pernik
or
lovelier
he
said
and
he
began
to
read
simply
and
with
a
passionate
pleasure
in
the
subtle
study
feeling
its
control
over
his
hearers
the
gentlemen
lay
smoking
about
at
their
ease
at
the
end
a
deep
sigh
went
up
from
the
ladies
cut
short
by
the
question
which
they
immediately
fell
into
they
could
not
agree
but
they
said
one
after
another
but
you
read
beautifully
mavering
beautifully
yes
indeed
well
i
glad
there
is
one
point
clear
he
said
putting
the
book
away
and
i
afraid
you
think
i
rather
sentimental
he
added
in
a
low
voice
to
alice
carrying
poetry
around
with
oh
no
she
replied
intensely
i
thank
i
thank
you
he
retorted
and
their
eyes
met
in
a
deep
look
one
of
the
outer
circle
of
smokers
came
up
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
and
addressed
the
company
do
you
know
what
time
it
got
to
be
four
they
all
sprang
up
with
a
clamour
of
surprise
pasmer
under
cover
of
the
noise
said
in
a
low
tone
to
her
daughter
alice
i
think
you
better
keep
a
little
more
with
me
yes
said
the
girl
in
a
sympathy
with
her
mother
in
which
she
did
not
always
find
herself
but
when
mavering
whom
their
tacit
treaty
concerned
turned
toward
them
and
put
himself
in
charge
of
alice
pasmer
found
herself
dispossessed
by
the
charm
of
his
confidence
and
relinquished
her
to
him
they
were
going
to
walk
to
the
castle
rocks
by
the
path
that
now
loses
and
now
finds
itself
among
the
fastnesses
of
the
forest
stretching
to
the
loftiest
outlook
on
the
bay
the
savage
woodland
is
penetrated
only
by
this
forgetful
path
that
passes
now
and
then
aver
the
bridge
of
a
ravine
and
offers
to
the
eye
on
either
hand
the
mystery
deepening
into
wilder
and
weirder
tracts
of
solitude
the
party
resolved
itself
into
twos
and
threes
and
these
straggled
far
apart
out
of
conversational
reach
of
one
another
pasmer
found
herself
walking
and
talking
with
john
munt
mr
pasmer
has
much
interest
in
these
excursions
he
suggested
no
he
never
goes
she
answered
and
by
one
of
the
agile
intellectual
processes
natural
to
women
she
arrived
at
the
question
you
and
the
maverings
are
old
friends
munt
i
ca
say
about
the
son
but
i
his
father
friend
and
i
suppose
that
i
his
friend
too
everybody
seems
to
be
so
suggested
munt
oh
yes
pasmer
assented
he
appears
to
be
a
universal
we
used
to
expect
great
things
of
elbridge
mavering
in
college
we
were
rather
more
romantic
than
the
harvard
men
are
nowadays
and
we
believed
in
one
another
more
than
they
do
perhaps
we
idealised
one
another
but
anyway
our
class
thought
mavering
could
do
anything
you
know
about
his
taste
for
etchings
yes
said
pasmer
with
a
sigh
of
deep
appreciation
what
gifted
people
i
understand
that
the
son
inherits
all
his
father
he
sketches
and
mavering
wrote
why
he
was
our
class
poet
cried
munt
remembering
the
fact
with
surprise
and
gratification
to
himself
he
was
a
tremendous
really
and
he
seems
so
amiable
oh
it
was
only
on
perhaps
he
still
keeps
it
up
on
suggested
pasmer
munt
laughed
at
the
little
joke
with
a
that
flattered
the
veteran
flatterer
i
should
like
to
ask
him
that
some
time
will
you
lend
it
to
me
yes
if
such
a
sayer
of
good
things
will
deign
to
borrow
oh
pasmer
cried
munt
otherwise
speechless
and
the
mother
do
you
know
mavering
mrs
mavering
i
never
oh
said
pasmer
with
a
disappointment
for
which
munt
tried
to
console
her
i
never
even
been
at
their
place
he
asked
me
once
a
great
while
ago
but
you
know
how
those
things
are
i
heard
that
she
used
to
be
very
pretty
and
very
gay
they
went
about
a
great
deal
to
saratoga
and
cape
may
and
such
places
rather
out
of
our
and
now
and
now
she
been
an
invalid
for
a
great
many
years
bedridden
i
believe
paralysis
i
yes
saintsbury
said
something
of
the
well
said
munt
anxious
to
add
to
the
store
of
knowledge
which
this
remark
let
him
understand
he
had
not
materially
increased
i
think
mavering
was
the
origin
of
the
or
her
money
mavering
was
poor
her
father
had
started
it
and
mavering
turned
in
his
how
very
interesting
and
is
that
the
reason
its
being
ancestral
that
mavering
wishes
his
son
to
go
into
it
is
he
going
into
it
asked
munt
he
come
up
here
to
think
about
i
should
suppose
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
said
munt
what
a
very
remarkable
forest
said
pasmer
examining
it
on
either
side
and
turning
quite
round
this
gave
her
from
her
place
in
the
van
of
the
straggling
procession
a
glimpse
of
alice
and
dan
mavering
far
in
the
rear
do
you
know
he
was
saying
to
the
girl
at
the
same
moment
like
some
of
those
dore
illustrations
to
the
inferno
or
the
wandering
oh
yes
i
was
trying
to
think
what
it
was
made
me
think
i
had
seen
it
before
she
answered
it
must
be
that
but
how
strange
it
is
she
exclaimed
that
sensation
of
having
been
there
before
in
some
place
before
where
you
ca
possibly
have
and
do
you
feel
it
here
he
asked
as
vividly
interested
as
if
they
two
had
been
the
first
to
notice
the
phenomenon
which
has
been
a
psychical
consolation
to
so
many
young
observers
yes
she
cried
i
hope
i
was
with
you
he
said
with
a
sudden
turn
of
levity
which
did
not
displease
her
for
there
seemed
to
be
a
tender
earnestness
lurking
in
it
i
could
bear
to
think
of
your
being
alone
in
such
a
howling
oh
i
was
with
a
large
picnic
she
retorted
gaily
you
might
have
been
among
the
rest
i
did
well
the
next
time
i
wish
you
look
closer
i
do
like
being
left
they
were
so
far
behind
the
rest
that
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
her
and
they
had
grown
more
and
more
confidential
they
came
to
a
narrow
over
a
deep
gorge
the
had
fallen
away
he
sprang
forward
and
gave
her
his
hand
for
the
passage
who
helped
you
over
here
he
demanded
do
say
i
perhaps
it
was
you
she
murmured
letting
him
keep
the
fingers
to
which
he
clung
a
moment
after
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
then
she
took
them
away
and
said
but
i
ca
be
sure
there
were
so
many
other
fellows
he
demanded
placing
himself
before
her
on
the
narrow
path
so
that
she
could
not
get
by
try
to
remember
miss
pasmer
this
is
very
important
it
would
break
my
heart
if
it
was
really
some
one
she
stole
a
glance
at
his
face
but
it
was
smiling
though
his
voice
was
so
earnest
i
want
to
help
you
over
all
the
bad
places
and
i
do
want
any
one
else
to
have
a
hand
in
the
voice
and
the
face
still
belied
each
other
and
between
them
the
girl
chose
to
feel
herself
trifled
with
by
the
artistic
temperament
if
you
please
step
out
of
the
way
mavering
she
said
severely
i
shall
not
need
anybody
help
just
he
instantly
moved
aside
and
they
were
both
silent
till
she
said
as
she
quickened
her
pace
to
overtake
the
others
in
front
i
do
see
how
you
can
help
liking
nature
in
such
a
place
as
i
ca
human
nature
he
said
it
was
mere
folly
and
an
abstract
folly
at
that
but
the
face
that
she
held
down
and
away
from
him
flushed
with
sweet
consciousness
as
she
laughed
on
the
cliff
beetling
above
the
bay
where
she
sat
to
look
out
over
the
sad
northern
sea
lit
with
the
fishing
sail
they
had
seen
before
and
the
surge
washed
into
the
rocky
coves
far
beneath
them
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
made
her
alone
in
the
company
that
came
and
went
and
tried
this
view
and
that
from
the
different
points
where
the
picnic
hostess
insisted
they
should
enjoy
it
she
left
the
young
couple
to
themselves
and
pasmer
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
she
had
bidden
alice
to
be
a
little
more
with
her
alice
had
forgotten
it
too
she
sat
listening
to
mavering
talk
with
a
certain
fascination
but
not
so
much
apparently
because
the
meaning
of
the
words
pleased
her
as
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
motion
of
his
lips
in
speaking
charmed
her
at
first
he
was
serious
and
even
melancholy
as
if
he
were
afraid
he
had
offended
her
but
apparently
he
soon
believed
that
he
had
been
forgiven
and
began
to
burlesque
his
own
mood
but
still
with
a
deference
and
a
watchful
observance
of
her
changes
of
feeling
which
was
delicately
flattering
in
its
way
now
and
then
when
she
answered
something
it
was
not
always
to
the
purpose
he
accused
her
of
not
hearing
what
he
said
but
she
would
have
it
that
she
did
and
then
he
tried
to
test
her
by
proofs
and
questions
it
did
not
matter
for
anything
that
was
spoken
or
done
speech
and
action
of
whatever
sort
were
mere
masks
of
their
young
joy
in
each
other
so
that
when
he
said
after
he
had
quoted
some
lines
befitting
the
scene
they
looked
out
on
now
was
that
from
tennyson
or
from
tupper
and
she
answered
neither
it
was
from
shakespeare
they
joined
in
the
same
happy
laugh
and
they
laughed
now
and
then
without
saying
anything
neither
this
nor
that
made
them
more
glad
or
less
they
were
in
a
trance
vulnerable
to
nothing
but
the
summons
which
must
come
to
leave
their
dream
behind
and
issue
into
the
waking
world
in
hope
or
in
experience
such
a
moment
has
come
to
all
and
it
is
so
pretty
to
those
who
recognise
it
from
the
outside
that
no
one
has
the
heart
to
hurry
it
away
while
it
can
be
helped
the
affair
between
alice
and
mavering
had
evidently
her
mother
sanction
and
all
the
rest
were
eager
to
help
it
on
when
the
party
had
started
to
return
they
called
to
them
and
let
them
come
behind
together
at
the
carriages
they
had
what
miss
anderson
called
a
new
deal
and
alice
and
mavering
found
themselves
together
in
the
rear
seat
of
the
last
the
fog
began
to
come
in
from
the
sea
and
followed
them
through
the
woods
when
they
emerged
upon
the
highway
it
wrapped
them
densely
round
and
formed
a
little
world
cosy
intimate
where
they
two
dwelt
alone
with
these
friends
of
theirs
each
of
whom
they
praised
for
delightful
qualities
the
horses
beat
along
through
the
mist
in
which
there
seemed
no
progress
and
they
lived
in
a
blissful
arrest
of
time
miss
anderson
called
back
from
the
front
seat
my
ear
buyns
you
talkin
about
which
ear
cried
mavering
oh
the
left
of
then
it
merely
habit
julie
you
ought
to
have
heard
the
nice
things
we
were
saying
about
you
alice
called
i
like
to
hear
all
the
nice
things
you
been
this
seemed
the
last
effect
of
subtle
wit
mavering
broke
out
in
his
laugh
and
alice
laugh
rang
above
it
pasmer
looked
involuntarily
round
from
the
carriage
ahead
they
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
said
brinkley
at
her
side
yes
i
hope
alice
is
i
afraid
you
dreadfully
tired
said
mavering
to
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
as
he
lifted
her
from
her
place
when
they
reached
the
hotel
through
the
provisional
darkness
and
found
that
after
all
it
was
only
oh
no
i
feel
as
if
the
picnic
were
just
then
you
will
come
i
will
see
what
mamma
shall
i
ask
her
oh
perhaps
not
said
the
girl
repressing
his
ardour
but
not
severely
xviii
they
were
going
to
have
some
theatricals
at
one
of
the
cottages
and
the
lady
at
whose
house
they
were
to
be
given
made
haste
to
invite
all
the
picnic
party
before
it
dispersed
pasmer
accepted
with
a
mental
reservation
meaning
to
send
an
excuse
later
if
she
chose
and
before
she
decided
the
point
she
kept
her
husband
from
going
after
dinner
into
the
where
he
spent
nearly
all
his
time
over
a
paper
and
a
cigar
or
in
sitting
absolutely
silent
and
unoccupied
and
made
him
go
to
their
own
room
with
her
there
is
something
that
i
must
speak
to
you
about
she
said
closing
the
door
and
you
must
decide
for
yourself
whether
you
wish
to
let
it
go
any
what
go
any
further
asked
pasmer
sitting
down
and
putting
his
hand
to
the
pocket
that
held
his
with
the
same
series
of
motions
no
do
smoke
she
said
staying
his
hand
impatiently
i
want
you
to
how
can
i
think
if
i
do
smoke
very
well
smoke
then
do
you
want
this
affair
with
young
mavering
to
go
any
farther
oh
said
pasmer
i
thought
you
had
been
looking
after
he
had
in
fact
relegated
that
to
the
company
of
the
great
questions
exterior
to
his
personal
comfort
which
she
always
decided
i
have
been
looking
after
it
but
now
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
as
a
father
take
some
interest
in
pasmer
noble
mask
of
a
face
from
the
point
of
his
full
white
beard
to
his
fine
forehead
crossed
by
his
impressive
black
eyebrows
expressed
all
the
dignified
concern
which
a
father
ought
to
feel
in
such
an
affair
but
what
he
was
really
feeling
was
a
grave
reluctance
to
have
to
intervene
in
any
way
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
to
him
he
asked
why
i
do
know
that
he
going
to
ask
you
anything
i
do
know
whether
he
said
anything
to
alice
yet
said
pasmer
with
some
exasperation
her
husband
was
silent
but
his
silence
insinuated
a
degree
of
wonder
that
she
should
approach
him
prematurely
on
such
a
point
they
have
been
thrown
together
all
day
and
there
is
no
use
to
conceal
from
ourselves
that
they
are
very
much
taken
with
each
other
i
thought
pasmer
said
that
you
said
that
from
the
beginning
you
want
them
to
be
taken
with
each
other
that
is
what
you
are
to
pasmer
silently
refused
to
assume
the
responsibility
well
demanded
his
wife
after
waiting
for
him
to
speak
well
what
what
do
you
decide
what
is
the
use
of
deciding
a
thing
when
it
is
all
over
it
is
over
at
all
it
can
be
broken
off
at
any
well
break
it
off
then
if
you
pasmer
resumed
the
responsibility
with
a
sigh
she
felt
the
burden
the
penalty
of
power
after
having
so
long
enjoyed
its
sweets
and
she
would
willingly
have
abdicated
the
sovereignty
which
she
had
spent
her
whole
married
life
in
establishing
but
there
was
no
one
to
take
it
up
no
i
shall
not
break
it
off
she
said
resentfully
i
shall
let
it
go
then
seeing
that
her
husband
was
not
shaken
by
her
threat
from
his
subjection
she
added
it
is
an
ideal
affair
but
i
think
it
will
be
a
very
good
thing
for
alice
he
is
not
what
i
expected
but
he
is
thoroughly
nice
and
i
should
think
his
family
was
nice
been
talking
with
munt
about
them
and
he
confirms
all
that
etta
saintsbury
said
i
do
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
of
his
intentions
in
coming
here
he
is
a
particularly
artless
young
man
but
he
been
sufficiently
frank
about
alice
since
he
been
her
husband
smoked
on
his
father
seems
to
have
taken
up
the
business
from
the
artistic
side
and
mavering
wo
be
expected
to
enter
into
the
commercial
part
at
once
if
it
was
for
alice
i
do
believe
he
would
think
of
the
business
for
a
moment
he
would
study
law
of
course
it
a
little
embarrassing
to
have
her
engaged
at
once
before
she
seen
anything
of
society
here
but
perhaps
it
all
for
the
best
after
all
the
main
thing
is
that
she
should
be
satisfied
and
i
can
see
that
she
only
too
much
so
yes
she
very
much
taken
with
him
and
i
wonder
he
is
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
pasmer
had
reasoned
in
this
round
but
the
utterance
of
her
thoughts
seemed
to
throw
a
new
light
on
them
and
she
took
a
courage
from
them
that
they
did
not
always
impart
she
arrived
at
the
final
opinion
expressed
with
a
throb
of
tenderness
for
the
young
fellow
whom
she
believed
eager
to
take
her
daughter
from
her
and
now
for
the
first
time
she
experienced
a
desolation
in
the
prospect
as
if
it
were
an
accomplished
fact
she
was
morally
a
bundle
of
finesses
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
her
daughter
was
all
the
world
to
her
she
had
made
the
girl
her
idol
and
if
like
some
other
heathen
she
had
not
always
used
her
idol
with
the
greatest
deference
if
she
had
often
expected
the
impossible
from
it
and
made
it
pay
for
her
disappointment
still
she
had
never
swerved
from
her
worship
of
it
she
suddenly
asked
herself
what
if
this
young
fellow
so
charming
and
so
good
should
so
wholly
monopolise
her
child
that
she
should
no
longer
have
any
share
in
her
what
if
alice
who
had
so
long
formed
her
first
care
and
chief
object
in
life
should
contentedly
lose
herself
in
the
love
and
care
of
another
and
both
should
ignore
her
right
to
her
she
answered
herself
with
a
pang
that
this
might
happen
with
any
one
alice
married
and
that
it
would
be
no
worse
at
the
worst
with
dan
mavering
than
with
another
while
her
husband
remained
impartially
silent
always
keeping
within
the
lines
to
which
his
wife
supremacy
had
driven
him
he
felt
safe
there
and
was
not
to
be
easily
coaxed
out
of
them
pasmer
rose
and
left
him
with
his
perfect
acquiescence
and
went
into
her
daughter
room
she
found
alice
there
with
a
pretty
evening
dress
laid
out
on
her
bed
pasmer
was
very
fond
of
that
dress
and
at
the
thought
of
alice
in
it
her
spirits
rose
again
oh
are
you
going
alice
why
yes
answered
the
girl
did
you
accept
why
yes
pasmer
admitted
but
are
you
tired
oh
not
in
the
least
i
feel
as
fresh
as
i
did
this
morning
do
you
want
me
to
go
oh
yes
certainly
i
want
you
to
go
if
you
think
you
enjoy
enjoy
it
why
why
should
i
enjoy
it
mamma
what
are
you
thinking
about
it
going
to
be
the
greatest
kind
of
but
do
you
think
you
ought
to
look
at
everything
simply
as
fun
asked
the
mother
with
unwonted
didacticism
how
everything
what
are
you
thinking
about
mamma
oh
nothing
i
so
glad
you
going
to
wear
that
why
of
course
it
my
best
but
what
are
you
driving
at
mamma
pasmer
was
really
seeking
in
her
daughter
that
comfort
of
a
distinct
volition
which
she
had
failed
to
find
in
her
husband
and
she
wished
to
assure
herself
of
it
more
and
more
that
she
might
share
with
some
one
the
responsibility
which
he
had
refused
any
part
in
nothing
but
i
glad
you
wish
so
much
to
the
girl
dropped
her
hands
and
stared
you
must
have
enjoyed
yourself
she
added
as
if
that
were
an
explanation
of
course
i
enjoyed
myself
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
my
wanting
to
go
oh
nothing
but
i
hope
alice
that
there
is
one
thing
you
have
looked
fully
in
the
what
thing
faltered
the
girl
and
now
showed
herself
unable
to
confront
it
by
dropping
her
eyes
well
whatever
you
may
have
heard
or
seen
nobody
else
is
in
doubt
about
it
what
do
you
suppose
has
brought
mavering
here
i
do
the
denial
not
only
confessed
that
she
did
know
but
it
informed
her
mother
that
all
was
as
yet
tacit
between
the
young
people
very
well
then
i
know
said
pasmer
and
there
is
one
thing
that
you
must
know
before
long
what
she
asked
faintly
your
own
mind
said
her
mother
i
do
ask
you
what
it
is
and
i
shall
wait
till
you
tell
me
of
course
i
should
have
let
him
stay
here
if
i
had
objected
o
mamma
murmured
the
girl
dyed
with
shame
to
have
the
facts
so
boldly
touched
but
not
probably
too
deeply
displeased
yes
and
i
know
that
he
would
never
have
thought
of
going
into
that
business
if
he
had
not
expected
hoped
mamma
and
you
ought
to
consider
oh
do
do
do
implored
the
girl
that
all
said
her
mother
turning
from
alice
who
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
to
inspect
the
costume
on
the
bed
she
lifted
one
piece
of
it
after
another
turned
it
over
looked
at
it
and
laid
it
down
you
can
never
get
such
a
dress
in
this
she
went
out
of
the
room
as
the
girl
dropped
her
face
in
the
pillow
an
hour
later
they
met
equipped
for
the
evening
pleasure
to
the
keen
glance
that
her
mother
gave
her
the
daughter
eyes
had
the
brightness
of
eyes
that
have
been
weeping
but
they
were
also
bright
with
that
knowledge
of
her
own
mind
which
pasmer
had
desired
for
her
she
met
her
mother
glance
fearlessly
even
proudly
and
she
carried
her
stylish
costume
with
a
splendour
to
which
only
occasions
could
stimulate
her
they
dramatised
a
perfect
unconsciousness
to
each
other
but
pasmer
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
decision
which
she
had
read
in
her
daughter
looks
somehow
it
did
not
relieve
her
of
the
responsibility
and
it
did
not
change
the
nature
of
the
case
it
was
gratifying
of
course
to
see
alice
the
object
of
a
passion
so
sincere
and
so
ardent
so
far
the
triumph
was
complete
and
there
was
really
nothing
objectionable
in
the
young
man
and
his
circumstances
though
there
was
nothing
very
distinguished
but
the
affair
was
altogether
different
from
anything
that
pasmer
had
imagined
she
had
supposed
and
intended
that
alice
should
meet
some
one
in
boston
and
go
through
a
course
of
society
before
reaching
any
decisive
step
there
was
to
be
a
whole
season
in
which
to
look
the
ground
carefully
over
and
the
ground
was
to
be
all
within
certain
and
guarded
precincts
but
this
that
had
happened
was
outside
of
these
precincts
of
at
least
on
their
mere
outskirts
class
day
of
course
was
all
right
and
she
could
not
say
that
the
summer
colony
at
campobello
was
not
thoroughly
and
essentially
boston
and
yet
she
felt
that
certain
influences
certain
sanctions
were
absent
to
tell
the
truth
she
would
not
have
cared
for
the
feelings
of
mavering
family
in
regard
to
the
matter
except
as
they
might
afterward
concern
alice
and
the
time
had
not
come
when
she
could
recognise
their
existence
in
regard
to
the
affair
and
yet
she
could
have
wished
that
even
as
it
was
his
family
could
have
seen
and
approved
it
from
the
start
it
would
have
been
more
regular
with
alice
it
was
a
simpler
matter
and
of
course
deeper
for
her
it
was
only
a
question
of
himself
and
herself
no
one
else
existed
to
the
sublime
egotism
of
her
love
she
did
not
call
it
by
that
name
she
did
not
permit
it
to
assert
itself
by
any
name
it
was
a
mere
formless
joy
in
her
soul
a
trustful
and
blissful
expectance
which
she
now
no
more
believed
he
could
disappoint
than
that
she
could
die
within
that
hour
all
the
rebellion
that
she
had
sometimes
felt
at
the
anomalous
attitude
exacted
of
her
sex
in
regard
to
such
matters
was
gone
she
no
longer
thought
it
strange
that
a
girl
should
be
expected
to
ignore
the
admiration
of
a
young
man
till
he
explicitly
declared
it
and
should
then
be
fully
possessed
of
all
the
materials
of
a
decision
on
the
most
momentous
question
in
life
for
she
knew
that
this
state
of
ignorance
could
never
really
exist
she
had
known
from
the
first
moment
that
he
had
thought
her
beautiful
she
was
radiant
for
him
her
eyes
shone
with
the
look
in
which
they
should
meet
and
give
themselves
to
each
other
before
they
spoke
the
look
in
which
they
had
met
already
in
which
they
had
lived
that
whole
day
xix
the
evening
entertainment
was
something
that
must
fail
before
an
audience
which
was
not
very
kind
they
were
to
present
a
burlesque
of
classic
fable
and
the
parts
with
their
general
intention
had
been
distributed
to
the
different
actors
but
nothing
had
been
written
down
and
beyond
the
situations
and
a
few
points
of
dialogue
all
had
to
be
improvised
the
costumes
and
properties
had
been
invented
from
such
things
as
came
to
hand
sheets
sculpturesquely
draped
the
deities
who
took
part
a
from
the
hearth
did
duty
as
the
leopard
skin
of
bacchus
a
feather
duster
served
neptune
for
a
trident
the
lyre
of
apollo
was
a
a
gull
breast
furnished
jove
with
his
grey
beard
the
fable
was
adapted
to
modern
life
and
the
scene
had
been
laid
in
campobello
the
peculiarities
of
which
were
to
be
satirised
throughout
the
principal
situation
was
to
be
a
passage
between
jupiter
represented
by
mavering
and
juno
whom
miss
anderson
personated
it
was
to
be
a
scene
of
conjugal
reproaches
and
reprisals
and
to
end
in
reconciliation
in
which
the
father
of
the
gods
sacrificed
himself
on
the
altar
of
domestic
peace
by
promising
to
bring
his
family
to
campobello
every
year
this
was
to
be
followed
by
a
sketch
of
the
judgment
of
paris
in
which
juno
and
pallas
were
to
be
personated
by
two
young
men
and
miss
anderson
took
the
part
of
venus
the
pretty
of
the
trevors
young
people
from
albany
and
cousins
of
miss
anderson
was
curtained
off
at
one
end
for
a
stage
and
beyond
the
sliding
doors
which
divided
it
in
half
were
set
chairs
for
the
spectators
people
had
come
in
whatever
dress
they
liked
the
men
were
mostly
in
morning
coats
the
ladies
had
generally
made
some
attempt
at
evening
toilet
but
they
joined
in
admiring
alice
pasmer
costume
and
one
of
them
said
that
they
would
let
it
represent
them
all
and
express
what
each
might
have
done
if
she
would
there
was
not
much
time
for
their
tributes
all
the
lamps
were
presently
taken
away
and
set
along
the
floor
in
front
of
the
curtain
as
leaving
the
company
in
a
darkness
which
brinkley
pronounced
sepulchral
she
made
her
reproaches
to
the
master
of
the
house
who
had
effected
this
transposition
of
the
lamps
i
was
just
thinking
some
very
pretty
and
valuable
things
about
your
charming
cottage
trevor
a
rug
on
a
bare
floor
a
trim
of
varnished
pine
a
wall
with
half
a
dozen
simple
etchings
on
it
an
open
fire
and
a
mantelpiece
without
how
entirely
satisfying
it
all
is
and
how
it
upbraids
us
for
heaping
up
upholstery
as
we
do
in
town
go
on
said
the
host
those
are
beautiful
but
i
ca
go
on
in
the
dark
retorted
brinkley
you
think
in
the
dark
much
less
talk
can
you
pasmer
pasmer
with
alice
next
to
her
sat
just
in
front
of
brinkley
no
she
assented
but
if
i
could
you
can
thick
anywhere
brinkley
trevor
lovely
house
would
inspire
me
to
two
birds
with
one
stone
thank
you
pasmer
for
my
part
of
the
compliment
pick
yourself
up
oh
thank
you
i
all
right
said
trevor
panting
after
the
meanings
as
a
man
must
i
suppose
thinking
and
talking
in
the
dark
is
a
good
deal
like
smoking
in
the
no
thinking
and
talking
are
not
at
all
like
smoking
under
any
conditions
why
in
the
world
should
they
be
oh
i
ca
get
any
fun
out
of
a
cigar
unless
i
can
see
the
smoke
the
host
explained
do
you
follow
him
pasmer
yes
thank
you
pasmer
said
trevor
i
get
you
to
tell
me
how
you
did
it
some
time
said
brinkley
but
your
house
is
a
gem
is
it
cried
trevor
i
want
my
wife
to
live
here
the
year
it
was
the
trevors
first
summer
in
their
cottage
and
the
experienced
reader
will
easily
recognise
his
mood
but
she
such
a
worldly
spirit
she
oh
i
do
know
about
the
year
round
do
you
pasmer
i
should
said
alice
with
the
suddenness
of
youth
breaking
into
the
talk
which
she
had
not
been
supposed
to
take
any
interest
in
is
it
proper
to
kiss
a
young
lady
hand
said
trevor
gratefully
appealing
to
brinkley
it
is
very
customary
in
the
nineteenth
century
said
brinkley
but
you
might
kiss
her
fan
he
might
kiss
her
fan
might
he
pasmer
certainly
alice
hold
out
your
fan
the
girl
humoured
the
joke
laughing
trevor
pressed
his
lips
to
the
perfumed
sticks
i
will
tell
trevor
he
said
and
that
will
decide
it
will
decide
her
not
to
come
here
at
all
next
year
if
you
tell
her
he
never
tells
me
all
said
trevor
catching
so
much
of
the
talk
as
she
came
in
from
some
hospitable
cares
in
the
incapable
of
it
what
has
he
been
doing
now
nothing
or
i
will
tell
you
when
we
are
alone
trevor
said
brinkley
with
burlesque
sympathy
we
ought
to
have
a
scene
on
both
sides
of
the
a
boyish
face
all
excitement
was
thrust
out
between
the
curtains
forming
the
proscenium
of
the
little
theatre
all
ready
trevor
yes
all
ready
he
dashed
the
curtains
apart
and
marred
the
effect
of
his
own
disappearance
from
the
scene
by
tripping
over
the
long
legs
of
jove
stretched
out
to
the
front
where
he
sat
on
trevor
richest
rug
propped
with
sofa
cushions
on
either
hand
so
perish
all
the
impious
race
of
titans
enemies
of
the
gods
said
mavering
solemnly
as
the
boy
fell
sprawling
pick
the
giant
up
vulcan
my
the
boy
was
very
small
for
his
age
every
one
saw
that
the
accident
had
not
been
premeditated
and
when
vulcan
appeared
with
an
exaggerated
limp
and
carried
the
boy
off
a
burst
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
company
it
did
not
matter
what
the
play
was
to
have
been
after
that
it
all
turned
upon
the
accident
juno
came
on
and
began
to
reproach
jupiter
for
his
carelessness
i
sent
mercury
upstairs
for
the
aynica
but
he
says
it
no
use
that
boy
wo
be
able
to
pass
ball
for
a
week
how
often
have
i
told
you
not
to
sit
with
your
feet
out
that
way
i
knew
you
hurt
i
did
have
my
feet
out
retorted
jupiter
besides
he
added
with
dignity
and
a
burlesque
of
marital
special
pleading
which
every
wife
and
husband
recognised
i
always
sit
with
my
feet
out
so
and
i
always
will
so
long
as
i
the
spirit
of
a
is
he
delicious
buzzed
pasmer
leaning
backward
to
whisper
to
brinkley
it
was
not
that
she
thought
what
dan
had
just
said
was
so
very
fanny
but
people
are
immoderately
applausive
of
amateur
dramatics
and
she
was
feeling
very
fond
of
the
young
fellow
the
improvisation
went
wildly
and
adventurously
on
and
the
curtains
dropped
together
amidst
the
facile
acclaim
of
the
audience
it
very
well
for
jupiter
that
he
happened
to
think
of
the
curtain
said
brinkley
they
could
have
kept
it
up
at
that
level
much
oh
do
you
think
so
softly
murmured
pasmer
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
have
kept
it
up
all
night
if
they
i
doubt
it
trevor
said
brinkley
to
the
host
who
had
come
up
for
her
congratulations
do
you
always
have
such
brilliant
performances
well
we
have
so
far
he
answered
modestly
and
brinkley
laughed
with
him
this
was
the
first
entertainment
at
trevor
cottage
went
up
all
round
them
and
trevor
called
across
the
room
in
a
reproachful
whisper
loud
enough
for
every
one
to
hear
my
dear
enjoying
yourself
while
mavering
stood
between
the
parted
curtains
waiting
for
the
attention
of
the
company
on
account
of
an
accident
to
the
and
the
mental
exhaustion
of
some
of
the
deities
the
next
piece
will
be
omitted
and
the
performance
will
begin
with
the
one
after
while
the
audience
is
waiting
mercury
will
go
round
and
take
up
a
collection
for
the
victim
of
the
recent
accident
who
will
probably
be
indisposed
for
life
the
collector
will
be
accompanied
by
a
policeman
and
may
be
safely
he
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
with
a
pas
and
r
swirl
of
his
draperies
like
the
lord
chancellor
in
iolanthe
and
the
audience
again
abandoned
itself
to
applause
how
very
witty
he
is
said
miss
cotton
who
sat
near
john
munt
you
think
he
really
witty
yes
munt
assented
critically
but
you
should
have
known
his
oh
do
you
know
his
father
i
was
in
college
with
oh
do
tell
me
about
him
and
all
mavering
family
we
so
interested
you
know
on
account
of
is
it
pretty
to
have
that
little
love
idyl
going
on
here
i
wonder
i
been
wondering
all
the
time
what
she
thinks
of
all
this
do
you
suppose
she
quite
likes
it
his
costume
is
so
very
remarkable
miss
cotton
in
the
absence
of
any
lady
of
her
intimate
circle
was
appealing
confidentially
to
john
munt
why
do
you
think
there
anything
serious
between
them
he
asked
dropping
his
head
forward
as
people
do
in
church
when
they
wish
to
whisper
to
some
one
in
the
same
pew
why
yes
it
seems
so
murmured
miss
cotton
his
admiration
is
quite
undisguised
is
it
a
man
never
can
tell
said
munt
we
have
to
leave
those
things
to
you
oh
every
one
talking
of
it
i
assure
you
and
you
know
his
family
i
knew
his
father
once
rather
better
than
anybody
indeed
munt
sketched
rather
a
flattered
portrait
of
the
elder
mavering
his
ability
his
goodness
his
shyness
which
he
had
always
had
to
make
such
a
hard
fight
with
munt
was
sensible
of
an
access
of
popularity
in
knowing
dan
mavering
people
and
he
did
not
spare
his
colours
then
it
is
from
his
father
that
he
gets
everything
he
is
in
the
least
shy
said
miss
cotton
that
must
be
the
and
the
mother
the
mother
i
do
miss
cotton
sighed
sometimes
i
wish
that
he
did
show
a
little
more
trepidation
it
would
seem
as
if
he
were
more
alive
to
the
great
difference
that
there
is
between
alice
pasmer
and
other
munt
laughed
a
man
laugh
i
guess
he
pretty
well
alive
to
that
if
he
in
love
with
oh
in
a
certain
way
of
course
but
not
in
the
highest
way
now
for
instance
if
he
felt
all
her
fineness
as
as
we
do
i
do
believe
be
willing
to
appear
before
her
just
like
the
father
of
the
gods
wore
a
damask
tablecloth
of
a
pale
golden
hue
and
a
classic
pattern
his
arms
were
bare
and
rather
absurdly
white
on
his
feet
a
pair
of
shoes
had
a
very
striking
effect
of
sandals
it
seems
to
me
miss
cotton
pursued
that
if
he
really
appreciated
her
in
the
highest
way
he
would
wish
never
to
do
an
undignified
or
trivial
thing
in
her
oh
perhaps
it
that
that
pleases
her
in
him
they
say
we
always
taken
with
yes
do
you
think
so
asked
miss
cotton
the
curtains
were
flung
apart
and
the
judgment
of
paris
followed
rather
tamely
upon
what
had
gone
before
though
the
two
young
fellows
who
did
juno
and
minerva
were
very
amusing
and
the
dialogue
was
full
of
hits
some
of
the
audience
an
appreciative
minority
were
of
opinion
that
mavering
and
miss
anderson
surpassed
themselves
in
it
she
promised
him
the
most
beautiful
and
cultured
wife
in
greece
that
settles
it
he
answered
they
came
out
arm
in
arm
and
paris
having
put
on
a
striped
tennis
coat
over
his
greek
tunic
moved
round
among
the
company
for
their
congratulations
venus
ostentatiously
showing
the
apple
she
had
won
i
can
haydly
keep
from
eating
it
she
explained
to
alice
before
whom
she
dropped
mavering
arm
i
awfully
hungry
it
hayd
alice
stood
with
her
head
drawn
back
looking
at
the
excited
girl
with
a
smile
in
which
seemed
to
hover
somewhere
a
latent
bitterness
mavering
with
a
flushed
face
and
a
flying
tongue
was
exchanging
sallies
with
her
mother
who
smothered
him
in
flatteries
trevor
came
toward
the
group
and
announced
supper
mr
paris
will
you
take
miss
aphrodite
out
miss
anderson
swept
a
low
bow
of
renunciation
and
tacitly
relinquished
mavering
to
alice
oh
no
no
said
alice
shrinking
back
from
him
with
an
intensification
of
her
uncertain
smile
a
mere
mortal
oh
how
very
good
said
trevor
there
began
to
be
without
any
one
intending
it
that
sort
of
tacit
misunderstanding
which
is
all
the
worse
because
it
can
only
follow
upon
a
tacit
understanding
like
that
which
had
established
itself
between
alice
and
mavering
they
laughed
and
joked
together
gaily
about
all
that
went
on
they
were
perfectly
good
friends
he
saw
that
she
and
her
mother
were
promptly
served
he
brought
them
salad
and
and
coffee
himself
only
waiting
officially
upon
miss
anderson
first
and
alice
thanked
him
with
the
politest
deprecation
of
his
devotion
but
if
their
eyes
met
it
was
defensively
and
the
security
between
them
was
gone
mavering
vaguely
felt
the
loss
without
knowing
how
to
retrieve
it
and
it
made
him
go
on
more
desperately
with
miss
anderson
he
laughed
and
joked
recklessly
and
alice
began
to
mark
a
more
explicit
displeasure
with
her
she
made
her
mother
go
rather
early
on
her
part
miss
anderson
seemed
to
find
reason
for
resentment
in
alice
bearing
toward
her
as
if
she
had
said
to
herself
that
her
frank
loyalty
had
been
thrown
away
upon
a
cold
and
unresponsive
nature
and
that
her
harmless
follies
in
the
play
had
been
met
with
unjust
suspicions
she
began
to
make
reprisals
she
began
in
dead
earnest
to
flirt
with
mavering
before
the
evening
passed
she
had
made
him
seem
taken
with
her
but
how
justly
she
had
done
this
and
with
how
much
fault
of
his
no
one
could
have
said
there
were
some
who
did
not
notice
it
at
all
but
these
were
not
people
who
knew
mavering
or
knew
alice
very
well
xx
the
next
morning
alice
was
walking
slowly
along
the
road
toward
the
fishing
village
when
she
heard
rapid
plunging
strides
down
the
wooded
hillside
on
her
right
she
knew
them
for
mavering
and
she
did
not
affect
surprise
when
he
made
a
final
leap
into
the
road
and
shortened
his
pace
beside
her
may
i
join
you
miss
pasmer
i
am
only
going
down
to
the
she
began
and
you
let
me
go
with
you
said
the
young
fellow
the
fact
is
you
always
so
frank
that
you
make
everything
else
seem
silly
i
been
waiting
up
there
in
the
woods
for
you
to
come
by
pasmer
told
me
you
had
started
this
way
and
i
cut
across
lots
to
overtake
you
and
then
when
you
came
in
sight
i
had
to
let
you
pass
before
i
could
screw
my
courage
up
to
the
point
of
running
after
you
how
is
that
for
it
a
very
good
beginning
i
should
well
do
you
think
you
ought
to
say
now
that
you
sorry
you
were
so
formidable
am
i
so
formidable
she
asked
and
then
recognised
that
she
had
been
trapped
into
a
leading
question
you
are
to
me
because
i
would
like
always
to
be
sure
that
i
had
pleased
you
and
for
the
last
twelve
hours
i
only
been
able
to
make
sure
that
i
had
that
the
consolation
i
going
away
with
i
thought
i
get
you
to
confirm
my
impression
explicitly
that
why
i
wished
to
join
are
you
were
you
going
away
i
going
by
the
next
boat
what
the
use
of
staying
i
should
only
make
bad
worse
yesterday
i
hoped
but
last
night
spoiled
everything
pasmer
he
broke
out
with
a
rush
of
feeling
you
must
know
why
i
came
up
here
to
his
steps
took
him
a
little
ahead
of
her
and
he
could
look
back
into
her
face
as
he
spoke
but
apparently
he
saw
nothing
in
it
to
give
him
courage
to
go
on
for
he
stopped
and
then
continued
lightly
and
going
away
because
i
feel
that
i
made
a
failure
of
the
expedition
i
knew
that
you
were
supremely
disgusted
with
me
last
night
but
it
will
be
a
sort
of
comfort
if
you
tell
me
oh
said
alice
everybody
thought
it
was
very
brilliant
i
and
you
thought
it
was
a
piece
of
buffoonery
well
it
was
i
wish
you
say
so
miss
pasmer
though
i
did
mean
the
playing
entirely
it
would
be
something
to
start
from
and
i
want
to
make
a
beginning
turn
over
a
new
leaf
ca
you
help
me
to
inscribe
a
good
resolution
of
the
most
description
on
the
stainless
page
i
lain
awake
all
night
composing
one
would
you
like
to
hear
it
i
ca
see
what
good
that
would
do
she
said
with
some
relenting
toward
a
smile
in
which
he
instantly
prepared
himself
to
bask
but
you
will
when
i
done
it
now
listen
please
do
go
she
cut
him
short
with
a
return
to
her
severity
which
he
would
not
recognise
well
perhaps
i
better
not
he
consented
it
rather
a
long
resolution
and
i
do
know
that
i
committed
it
perfectly
yet
but
i
do
assure
you
that
if
you
were
disgusted
last
night
you
were
not
the
only
one
i
was
immensely
disgusted
myself
and
why
i
wanted
you
to
tell
me
so
was
because
when
i
have
a
strong
pressure
brought
to
bear
i
can
brace
up
and
do
almost
anything
he
said
dropping
into
earnest
then
he
rose
lightly
again
and
added
you
have
no
idea
how
unpleasant
it
is
to
lie
awake
all
night
throwing
dust
in
the
eyes
of
an
accusing
it
must
have
been
if
you
did
succeed
said
alice
drily
yes
that
it
that
just
the
point
if
i
succeeded
i
should
be
all
right
do
you
see
but
it
was
a
difficult
she
turned
her
face
away
but
he
saw
the
smile
on
her
cheek
and
he
laughed
as
if
this
were
what
he
had
been
trying
to
make
her
do
i
got
beaten
i
had
to
give
up
and
own
it
i
had
to
say
that
i
had
thrown
my
chance
away
and
i
had
better
take
myself
he
looked
at
her
with
a
real
anxiety
in
his
gay
eyes
the
boat
goes
just
after
lunch
i
believe
she
said
indifferently
oh
yes
i
shall
have
time
to
get
lunch
before
i
go
he
said
with
bitterness
but
lunch
is
the
only
thing
it
is
even
the
main
thing
miss
no
she
hardened
her
heart
he
waited
for
her
to
say
something
more
and
then
he
went
on
the
question
is
whether
there
time
to
undo
last
night
abolish
it
erase
it
from
the
calendar
of
recorded
time
sponge
it
out
in
short
and
get
back
to
yesterday
she
made
no
reply
to
this
you
think
it
was
a
very
pleasant
picnic
miss
pasmer
he
asked
with
pensive
respectfulness
very
she
answered
drily
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
woods
that
bordered
the
road
on
either
side
that
weird
forest
i
shall
never
forget
no
it
was
something
to
remember
she
said
and
the
blueberry
patch
we
must
forget
the
blueberry
there
were
a
great
many
she
walked
on
and
he
said
and
that
bridge
you
do
have
that
feeling
of
having
been
here
before
am
i
walking
too
fast
for
you
miss
pasmer
no
i
like
to
walk
but
would
you
like
to
sit
down
on
this
wayside
log
for
example
he
pointed
it
out
with
his
stick
it
seems
to
invite
repose
and
i
know
you
must
be
i
not
ah
that
shows
that
you
did
lie
awake
grieving
over
your
follies
all
night
i
hope
you
rested
well
miss
she
said
nothing
if
i
thought
if
i
could
hope
that
you
had
it
would
be
a
bond
of
sympathy
and
i
would
give
almost
anything
for
a
bond
of
sympathy
just
now
miss
pasmer
alice
he
said
with
sudden
seriousness
i
know
that
i
not
worthy
even
to
think
of
you
and
that
you
whole
worlds
above
me
in
every
way
it
that
that
takes
all
heart
out
of
me
and
leaves
me
without
a
word
to
say
when
i
like
to
say
so
much
i
would
like
to
speak
tell
you
she
interrupted
him
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
mavering
and
tell
you
that
i
very
tired
and
i
going
back
to
the
hotel
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
go
back
alice
i
love
i
sorry
you
said
it
sorry
why
he
asked
with
hopeless
futility
because
there
can
be
no
love
between
us
not
friendship
even
not
i
should
have
asked
for
your
acquaintance
your
friendship
if
his
words
conveyed
a
delicate
reproach
and
they
stung
her
because
they
put
her
in
the
wrong
no
matter
she
began
wildly
i
did
mean
to
wound
you
but
we
must
part
and
we
must
never
see
each
other
again
he
stood
confused
as
if
he
could
not
make
it
out
or
believe
it
but
yesterday
it
ah
no
it
last
night
and
i
can
no
she
cried
you
shall
not
make
me
out
so
mean
and
vindictive
i
do
care
for
last
night
nor
for
anything
that
this
was
not
true
but
it
seemed
so
to
her
at
the
moment
she
thought
that
she
really
no
longer
resented
his
association
with
miss
anderson
and
his
separation
from
herself
in
all
that
had
taken
place
then
what
is
it
i
ca
tell
you
but
everything
is
over
between
us
that
but
yesterday
and
all
these
days
past
you
seemed
it
unfair
of
you
to
insist
it
ungenerous
that
word
which
from
a
woman
tongue
always
strikes
a
man
like
a
blow
in
the
face
silenced
mavering
he
set
his
lips
and
bowed
and
they
parted
she
turned
upon
her
way
and
he
kept
the
path
which
she
had
been
going
it
was
not
the
hour
when
the
piazzas
were
very
full
and
she
slipped
into
the
dim
hotel
corridor
undetected
or
at
least
undetained
she
flung
into
her
room
and
confronted
her
mother
pasmer
was
there
looking
into
a
trunk
that
had
overflowed
from
her
own
chamber
what
is
the
matter
she
said
to
her
daughter
excited
face
mr
mavering
well
and
i
refused
pasmer
was
one
of
those
ladies
who
in
any
finality
have
a
keen
retrovision
of
all
the
advantages
of
a
different
conclusion
she
had
been
thinking
since
she
told
dan
mavering
which
way
alice
had
gone
to
walk
that
if
he
were
to
speak
to
her
now
and
she
were
to
accept
him
it
would
involve
a
great
many
embarrassing
consequences
but
she
had
consoled
herself
with
the
probability
that
he
would
not
speak
so
soon
after
the
effects
of
last
night
but
would
only
try
at
the
furthest
to
make
his
peace
with
alice
since
he
had
spoken
though
and
she
had
refused
him
pasmer
instantly
saw
all
the
pleasant
things
that
would
have
followed
in
another
event
refused
him
she
repeated
provisionally
while
she
gathered
herself
for
a
full
exploration
of
all
the
facts
yes
mamma
and
i
ca
talk
about
it
i
wish
never
to
hear
his
name
again
or
to
see
him
or
to
speak
to
why
of
course
not
said
pasmer
with
a
fine
smile
from
the
of
her
superior
years
if
you
refused
she
left
the
trunk
which
she
had
been
standing
over
and
sat
down
while
alice
swept
to
and
fro
before
her
excitedly
but
why
did
you
refuse
him
my
dear
why
because
he
detestable
perfectly
her
mother
probably
knew
how
to
translate
these
exalted
expressions
into
the
more
accurate
language
of
maturer
life
do
you
mean
last
night
last
night
cried
alice
tragically
no
why
should
i
care
for
last
night
then
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
retorted
pasmer
what
did
he
say
she
demanded
with
authority
mamma
i
ca
talk
about
it
i
but
you
must
alice
it
your
duty
of
course
i
must
know
about
it
what
did
he
say
alice
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
lips
firmly
closed
like
mavering
lips
it
occurred
to
her
and
then
she
opened
them
but
without
speaking
what
did
he
say
persisted
her
mother
and
her
persistence
had
its
effect
say
exclaimed
the
girl
indignantly
he
tried
to
make
me
i
see
said
pasmer
well
but
i
forced
him
to
speak
and
then
i
rejected
him
that
poor
fellow
said
pasmer
he
was
afraid
of
and
that
what
made
it
the
more
odious
do
you
think
i
wished
him
to
be
afraid
of
me
would
that
be
any
pleasure
i
should
hate
myself
if
i
had
to
quell
anybody
into
being
unlike
she
sat
down
for
a
moment
and
then
jumped
up
again
and
went
to
the
window
for
no
reason
and
came
back
yes
said
her
mother
impartially
he
light
and
he
roundabout
he
could
come
straight
at
and
would
you
have
me
accept
such
a
being
pasmer
smiled
a
little
at
the
literary
word
and
continued
but
he
very
sweet
and
he
as
good
as
the
day
long
and
he
very
fond
of
you
and
i
thought
you
liked
the
girl
threw
up
her
arms
across
her
eyes
oh
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
mamma
she
dropped
into
a
chair
at
the
bedside
and
let
her
face
fall
into
her
hands
and
cried
her
mother
waited
for
the
gust
of
tears
to
pass
before
she
said
but
if
you
feel
so
about
it
mamma
alice
sprang
to
her
feet
it
need
come
from
you
i
could
make
some
excuse
to
see
him
write
him
a
little
note
never
exclaimed
alice
grandly
what
i
done
i
done
from
my
reason
and
my
feelings
have
nothing
to
do
with
oh
very
well
said
her
mother
going
out
of
the
room
not
wholly
disappointed
with
what
she
viewed
as
a
respite
and
amused
by
her
daughter
tragics
but
if
you
think
that
the
feelings
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
matter
you
very
much
if
she
believed
that
her
daughter
did
not
know
her
real
motives
in
rejecting
dan
mavering
or
had
not
been
able
to
give
them
she
did
not
say
so
the
little
group
of
aliceolaters
on
the
piazza
who
began
to
canvass
the
causes
of
mavering
going
before
the
top
of
his
hat
disappeared
below
the
bank
on
the
path
leading
to
the
were
of
two
minds
one
faction
held
that
he
was
going
because
alice
had
refused
him
and
that
his
gaiety
up
to
the
last
moment
was
only
a
mask
to
hide
his
despair
the
other
side
contended
that
if
he
and
alice
were
not
actually
engaged
they
understood
each
other
and
he
was
going
away
because
he
wanted
to
tell
his
family
or
something
of
that
kind
between
the
two
opinions
miss
cotton
wavered
with
a
sentimental
attraction
to
either
what
do
you
really
think
she
asked
brinkley
arriving
from
lunch
at
the
corner
of
the
piazza
where
the
group
was
seated
oh
what
does
it
matter
at
their
age
she
demanded
but
they
just
of
the
age
when
it
does
happen
to
matter
suggested
stamwell
yes
said
brinkley
and
that
what
makes
the
whole
thing
so
perfectly
ridiculous
just
think
of
two
children
one
of
twenty
and
the
other
of
proposing
to
decide
their
lifelong
destiny
in
such
a
vital
matter
should
we
trust
their
judgment
in
regard
to
the
smallest
business
affair
of
course
not
they
babes
in
arms
morally
and
mentally
speaking
people
have
the
data
for
being
wisely
in
love
till
they
reached
the
age
when
they
have
the
least
wish
to
be
so
oh
i
suppose
i
thought
that
i
was
a
grown
woman
too
when
i
was
twenty
i
can
look
back
and
see
that
i
did
and
what
more
preposterous
still
i
thought
brinkley
was
a
man
at
but
we
were
no
more
fit
to
accept
or
reject
each
other
at
that
infantile
period
do
you
really
think
so
asked
miss
cotton
only
partially
credulous
of
brinkley
irony
yes
it
does
seem
out
of
all
reason
admitted
stamwell
of
course
it
is
said
brinkley
if
she
has
rejected
him
done
a
very
safe
thing
nobody
should
be
allowed
to
marry
before
fifty
then
if
people
married
it
would
be
because
they
knew
that
they
loved
each
miss
cotton
reflected
a
moment
it
is
strange
that
such
an
important
question
should
have
to
be
decided
at
an
age
when
the
judgment
is
so
far
from
mature
i
never
happened
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
yes
said
brinkley
and
she
made
herself
comfortable
in
an
arm
chair
commanding
a
stretch
of
the
bay
over
which
the
must
pass
but
it
only
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
affair
i
sure
that
no
grown
person
can
see
the
ridiculous
young
things
inexperienced
ignorant
featherbrained
that
nature
intrusts
with
children
their
immortal
little
souls
and
their
extremely
perishable
little
bodies
without
rebelling
at
the
whole
system
when
you
see
what
most
young
mothers
are
how
perfectly
unfit
and
incapable
you
wonder
that
the
whole
race
does
teeth
and
die
yes
there
one
thing
i
feel
pretty
sure
of
that
as
matters
are
arranged
now
there
ought
to
be
mothers
at
all
there
ought
to
be
only
the
group
all
laughed
even
miss
cotton
but
she
was
the
first
to
become
grave
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
there
was
a
doubt
whether
so
light
a
way
of
treating
serious
things
was
not
a
little
wicked
perhaps
she
said
we
shall
have
to
go
back
to
the
idea
that
engagements
and
marriages
are
not
intended
to
be
regulated
by
the
judgment
but
by
the
i
do
know
what
intended
said
brinkley
but
i
know
what
is
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
the
affections
have
it
their
own
way
and
i
must
say
i
do
think
the
judgment
could
make
a
greater
mess
of
it
in
fact
she
continued
perhaps
provoked
to
the
excess
by
the
deprecation
she
saw
in
miss
cotton
eye
i
consider
every
broken
engagement
nowadays
a
blessing
in
miss
cotton
said
nothing
the
other
ladies
said
why
brinkley
yes
the
thing
has
gone
altogether
too
far
the
pendulum
has
swung
in
that
direction
out
of
all
measure
we
are
married
too
much
and
as
a
natural
consequence
we
are
divorced
too
much
the
whole
case
is
in
a
nutshell
if
there
were
no
marriages
there
would
be
no
divorces
and
that
great
abuse
would
be
corrected
at
any
all
the
ladies
laughed
miss
cotton
more
and
more
sorrowfully
she
liked
to
have
people
talk
as
they
do
in
genteel
novels
brinkley
bold
expressions
were
a
series
of
violent
shocks
to
her
nature
and
imparted
a
terrible
vibration
to
the
fabric
of
her
whole
little
ideal
world
if
they
had
not
been
the
expressions
of
a
person
whom
a
great
many
unquestionable
persons
accepted
who
had
such
an
undoubted
standing
she
would
have
thought
them
very
coarse
as
it
was
they
had
a
great
fascination
for
her
but
in
a
case
like
that
of
she
looked
round
and
lowered
her
voice
our
young
friends
i
sure
you
rejoice
if
the
engagement
were
broken
well
i
not
going
to
be
mush
of
concession
as
emerson
says
miss
cotton
and
in
the
first
place
how
do
you
know
they
engaged
ah
i
do
i
did
mean
that
they
were
but
would
it
be
a
little
pathetic
if
after
all
that
we
seen
going
on
his
coming
here
expressly
on
her
account
and
his
perfect
devotion
to
her
for
the
past
two
weeks
it
should
end
in
nothing
two
weeks
is
a
very
long
time
to
settle
the
business
of
a
perhaps
she
proposed
delay
a
little
further
oh
of
course
that
would
be
perfectly
right
do
you
think
she
did
not
if
she
as
wise
as
the
rest
of
us
would
have
been
at
her
age
but
i
think
she
yes
said
miss
cotton
do
you
think
his
behaviour
last
night
would
naturally
impress
her
with
his
wisdom
and
constancy
no
i
ca
say
that
it
would
but
and
this
alice
of
yours
is
rather
a
severe
young
person
she
has
her
ideas
and
i
afraid
they
rather
heroic
she
be
just
with
him
of
course
but
there
nothing
a
man
dreads
so
much
as
justice
some
yes
pursued
miss
cotton
but
that
very
disparity
i
know
very
unlike
do
you
think
oh
yes
i
know
the
theory
about
that
but
if
they
were
exactly
alike
in
temperament
they
be
sufficiently
unlike
for
the
purposes
of
counterparts
that
was
arranged
once
for
all
when
and
female
created
he
them
i
no
doubt
their
fancy
was
caught
by
all
the
kinds
of
difference
they
find
in
each
other
that
just
as
natural
as
silly
but
the
misunderstanding
the
trouble
the
quarrelling
the
wear
and
tear
of
spirit
that
they
have
to
go
through
before
they
assimilated
it
makes
me
tired
as
the
boys
say
no
i
hope
for
the
young
man
own
sake
he
got
his
but
he
so
kind
so
good
my
dear
the
world
is
surfeited
with
kind
good
men
there
are
half
a
dozen
of
them
at
the
other
end
of
the
piazza
smoking
and
there
comes
another
to
join
them
she
added
as
a
large
figure
semicircular
in
profile
advanced
itself
from
a
doorway
toward
a
vacant
chair
among
the
smokers
the
very
soul
of
kindness
and
she
beckoned
toward
her
husband
who
caught
sight
of
her
gesture
now
i
can
tell
you
all
his
mental
processes
first
surprise
at
seeing
some
one
beckoning
then
astonishment
that
it
i
though
who
else
should
beckon
him
then
wonder
what
i
can
want
then
conjecture
that
i
may
want
him
to
come
here
then
pride
in
his
conjecture
rebellion
the
ladies
were
in
a
scream
of
laughter
as
brinkley
lumbered
heavily
to
their
group
what
is
it
he
asked
do
you
believe
in
broken
engagements
now
quick
who
engaged
no
well
you
know
punch
advice
to
those
about
to
marry
i
know
chestnuts
said
his
wife
scornfully
they
dismissed
each
other
with
tender
bluntness
and
he
went
in
to
get
a
match
ah
brinkley
said
one
of
the
ladies
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
you
to
preach
broken
engagements
to
any
one
who
saw
you
and
brinkley
they
fell
upon
her
one
after
another
and
mocked
her
with
the
difference
between
her
doctrine
and
practice
and
they
were
all
the
more
against
her
because
they
had
been
perhaps
a
little
put
down
by
her
whimsical
sayings
yes
she
admitted
but
we
been
thirty
years
coming
to
the
understanding
that
you
all
admire
so
much
and
do
you
think
it
was
worth
the
time
xxi
mavering
kept
up
until
he
took
leave
of
the
party
of
young
people
who
had
come
over
on
the
to
eastport
for
the
frolic
of
seeing
him
off
it
was
a
tremendous
tour
de
force
to
accept
their
company
as
if
he
were
glad
of
it
and
to
respond
to
all
their
gay
nothings
gaily
to
maintain
a
sunny
surface
on
his
turbid
misery
they
had
tried
to
make
alice
come
with
them
but
her
mother
pleaded
a
bad
headache
for
her
and
he
had
to
parry
a
hundred
sallies
about
her
and
from
his
sick
heart
humour
the
popular
insinuation
that
there
was
an
understanding
between
them
and
that
they
had
agreed
together
she
should
not
come
he
had
to
stand
about
on
the
steamboat
wharf
and
listen
to
amiable
innuendoes
for
nearly
an
hour
before
the
steamer
came
in
from
john
the
fond
adieux
of
his
friends
their
offers
to
take
any
message
back
lasted
during
the
interminable
fifteen
minutes
that
she
lay
at
her
moorings
and
then
he
showed
himself
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
waved
his
handkerchief
in
acknowledgment
of
the
last
parting
salutations
on
shore
when
it
was
all
over
he
went
down
into
his
and
shut
himself
in
and
let
his
misery
rollover
him
he
felt
as
if
there
were
a
flood
of
it
and
it
washed
him
to
and
fro
one
gall
of
shame
of
of
bitterness
from
head
to
foot
but
in
it
all
he
felt
no
resentment
toward
alice
no
wish
to
wreak
any
smallest
part
of
his
suffering
upon
her
even
while
he
had
hoped
for
her
love
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
not
seen
her
in
all
that
perfection
which
she
now
had
in
irreparable
loss
his
soul
bowed
itself
fondly
over
the
thought
of
her
and
stung
as
he
was
by
that
last
cruel
word
of
hers
he
could
not
upbraid
her
that
humility
which
is
love
casting
out
selfishness
the
most
egotistic
of
the
passions
triumphing
over
itself
mavering
experienced
it
to
the
full
he
took
all
the
blame
he
could
not
see
that
she
had
ever
encouraged
him
to
hope
for
her
love
which
now
appeared
a
treasure
heaven
far
beyond
his
scope
he
could
only
call
himself
fool
and
fool
and
fool
and
wonder
that
he
could
have
met
her
in
the
remoteness
of
that
morning
with
the
belief
that
but
for
the
follies
of
last
night
she
might
have
answered
him
differently
he
believed
now
that
whatever
had
gone
before
she
must
still
have
rejected
him
she
had
treated
his
presumption
very
leniently
she
had
really
spared
him
it
went
on
over
and
over
sometimes
it
varied
a
little
as
when
he
thought
of
how
when
she
should
tell
her
mother
pasmer
must
laugh
he
pictured
them
both
laughing
at
him
and
then
pasmer
he
had
scarcely
passed
a
dozen
words
with
in
and
asking
what
they
were
laughing
at
and
their
saying
and
his
laughing
too
at
other
times
he
figured
them
as
incensed
at
his
temerity
which
must
seem
to
them
greater
and
greater
as
now
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
never
thought
meanly
of
himself
and
the
world
so
far
had
seemed
to
think
well
of
him
but
because
alice
pasmer
was
impossible
to
him
he
felt
that
it
was
an
unpardonable
boldness
in
him
to
have
dreamed
of
her
what
must
they
be
saying
of
his
having
passed
from
the
ground
of
society
compliments
and
light
flirtation
to
actually
telling
alice
that
he
loved
her
he
wondered
what
pasmer
had
thought
of
his
telling
her
that
he
had
come
to
campobello
to
consider
the
question
whether
he
should
study
law
or
go
into
business
and
what
motive
she
had
supposed
he
had
in
telling
her
that
he
asked
himself
what
motive
he
had
and
tried
to
pretend
that
he
had
none
he
dramatised
conversations
with
pasmer
in
which
he
laughed
it
off
he
tried
to
remember
all
that
had
passed
the
day
before
at
the
picnic
and
whether
alice
had
done
or
said
anything
to
encourage
him
and
he
could
not
find
that
she
had
all
her
trust
and
freedom
was
because
she
felt
perfectly
safe
with
him
from
any
such
disgusting
absurdity
as
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
ride
home
through
the
mist
with
its
sweet
intimacy
that
parting
which
had
seemed
so
full
of
tender
intelligence
were
parts
of
the
same
illusion
there
had
been
nothing
of
it
on
her
side
from
the
beginning
but
a
kindliness
which
he
had
now
flung
away
for
ever
he
went
back
to
the
beginning
and
tried
to
remember
the
point
where
he
had
started
in
this
fatal
labyrinth
of
error
she
had
never
misled
him
but
he
had
misled
himself
from
the
first
glimpse
of
her
whatever
was
best
in
his
light
nature
whatever
was
generous
and
came
out
in
this
humiliation
from
the
vision
of
her
derision
he
passed
to
a
picture
of
her
suffering
from
pity
for
him
and
wrung
with
a
sense
of
the
pain
she
had
given
him
he
promised
himself
to
write
to
her
and
beg
her
not
to
care
for
him
because
he
was
not
worthy
of
that
he
framed
a
letter
in
his
mind
in
which
he
posed
in
some
noble
attitudes
and
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
by
his
magnanimous
appeal
to
her
not
to
suffer
for
the
sake
of
one
so
unworthy
of
her
serious
thought
he
pictured
her
greatly
moved
by
some
of
the
phrases
and
he
composed
for
her
a
reply
which
led
to
another
letter
from
him
and
so
to
a
correspondence
and
a
long
and
tender
friendship
in
the
end
he
died
suddenly
and
then
she
discovered
that
she
had
always
loved
him
he
discovered
that
he
was
playing
the
fool
again
and
he
rose
from
the
berth
where
he
had
tumbled
himself
the
had
that
smell
of
parboiled
paint
which
have
and
reminded
him
of
the
steamer
in
which
he
had
gone
to
europe
when
a
boy
with
the
family
just
after
his
mother
health
began
to
fail
he
went
down
on
the
deck
near
the
ladies
saloon
where
the
passengers
were
gathered
listening
to
the
same
band
of
plantation
negroes
who
had
amused
him
so
much
on
the
eastward
trip
the
passengers
were
mostly
pock
marked
provincials
and
many
of
them
were
women
they
lounged
on
the
barrels
of
apples
neatly
piled
up
and
listened
to
the
music
without
smiling
one
of
the
negroes
was
singing
to
the
banjo
and
another
began
to
do
the
rheumatic
uncle
breakdown
mavering
said
to
himself
i
ca
stand
that
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
alice
i
love
you
o
merciful
heavens
o
infernal
jackass
ow
gaw
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
he
found
a
gang
of
italian
labourers
returning
to
the
states
after
some
job
in
the
provinces
they
smoked
their
pipes
and
whined
their
neapolitan
dialect
together
it
made
mavering
think
of
dante
of
the
inferno
to
which
he
passed
naturally
from
his
for
having
been
an
infernal
jackass
the
inscription
on
the
gate
of
hell
ran
through
his
mind
he
thought
he
would
make
his
life
his
desolate
broken
life
a
perpetual
exile
like
dante
at
the
same
time
he
ground
his
teeth
and
muttered
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
oh
idiot
beast
oh
oh
the
pipes
reminded
him
to
smoke
and
he
took
out
his
cigarette
case
the
italians
looked
at
him
he
gave
all
the
cigarettes
among
them
without
keeping
any
for
himself
he
determined
to
spend
the
miserable
remnant
of
his
life
in
going
about
doing
good
and
bestowing
alms
he
groaned
aloud
so
that
the
italians
noticed
it
and
doubtless
spoke
of
it
among
themselves
he
could
not
understand
their
dialect
but
he
feigned
them
saying
respectfully
compassionate
things
then
he
gnashed
his
teeth
again
and
cursed
his
folly
when
the
bell
rang
for
supper
he
found
himself
very
hungry
and
ate
heavily
after
that
he
went
out
in
front
of
the
cabin
and
walked
up
and
down
thinking
and
trying
not
to
think
the
turmoil
in
his
mind
tired
him
like
a
prodigious
physical
exertion
toward
ten
the
night
grew
rougher
the
sea
was
so
phosphorescent
that
it
broke
in
sheets
and
flakes
of
pale
bluish
flame
from
the
bows
and
and
out
in
the
dark
the
waves
revealed
themselves
in
flashes
and
long
gleams
of
fire
one
of
the
officers
of
the
boat
came
and
hung
with
mavering
over
the
guard
the
weird
light
from
the
water
was
reflected
on
their
faces
and
showed
them
to
each
other
well
i
never
saw
anything
like
this
before
looks
like
hell
it
said
the
officer
yes
said
mavering
is
it
uncommon
well
i
should
say
so
i
guess
we
going
to
have
a
mavering
thought
of
blueberries
but
he
did
not
say
anything
i
guess
it
going
to
be
a
regular
mavering
did
not
care
he
asked
incuriously
how
do
you
find
your
course
in
such
weather
well
we
guess
where
we
are
and
then
give
her
so
many
turns
of
the
the
officer
laughed
and
mavering
laughed
too
he
was
struck
by
the
hollow
note
in
his
laugh
it
seemed
to
him
pathetic
he
wondered
if
he
should
now
always
laugh
so
and
if
people
would
remark
it
he
tried
another
laugh
it
sounded
mechanical
he
went
to
bed
and
was
so
worn
out
that
he
fell
asleep
and
began
to
dream
a
face
came
up
out
of
the
sea
and
brooded
over
the
waters
as
in
that
picture
of
vedder
which
he
calls
memory
but
the
hair
was
not
blond
it
was
the
colour
of
those
phosphorescent
flames
and
the
eyes
were
like
it
horrible
horrible
he
tried
to
shriek
but
he
cried
alice
i
love
there
was
a
burglar
in
the
room
and
he
was
running
after
miss
pasmer
mavering
caught
him
and
tried
to
beat
him
his
fists
fell
like
bolls
of
cotton
the
burglar
drew
his
breath
in
with
a
long
washing
sound
like
water
mavering
woke
deathly
sick
and
heard
the
sweep
of
the
waves
the
boat
was
pitching
frightfully
he
struggled
out
into
the
saloon
and
saw
that
it
was
five
in
five
hours
more
it
would
be
a
day
since
he
told
alice
that
he
loved
her
it
now
seemed
very
improbable
there
were
a
good
many
people
in
the
saloon
and
a
woman
came
running
out
of
her
straight
to
mavering
she
was
in
her
stocking
feet
and
her
hair
hung
down
her
back
oh
are
we
going
down
she
implored
him
have
we
struck
ought
we
to
pray
somebody
shall
i
wake
the
children
mavering
reassured
her
and
told
her
there
was
no
danger
well
then
she
said
i
go
back
for
my
yes
better
get
your
the
saloon
rose
round
him
and
sank
he
controlled
his
sickness
by
planting
a
chair
in
the
centre
and
sitting
in
it
with
his
eyes
shut
as
he
grew
more
comfortable
he
reflected
how
he
had
calmed
that
woman
and
he
resolved
again
to
spend
his
life
in
doing
good
yes
that
the
only
ticket
he
said
to
himself
with
involuntary
frivolity
he
thought
of
what
the
officer
had
said
and
he
helplessly
added
circus
ticket
reserved
then
he
began
again
and
loaded
himself
with
execration
the
boat
got
into
portland
at
nine
and
mavering
left
her
taking
his
with
him
and
letting
his
trunk
go
on
to
boston
the
officer
who
received
his
ticket
at
the
gangplank
noticed
the
destination
on
it
and
said
got
enough
yes
for
one
mavering
recognised
his
acquaintance
of
the
night
before
do
like
picnics
very
no
said
mavering
with
abysmal
gloom
they
do
agree
with
me
never
he
was
aware
of
trying
to
make
his
laugh
bitter
the
officer
did
not
notice
mavering
was
surprised
after
the
chill
of
the
storm
at
sea
to
find
it
rather
a
warm
close
morning
in
portland
the
restaurant
to
which
the
hackman
took
him
as
the
best
in
town
was
full
of
flies
they
bit
him
awake
out
of
the
dreary
reveries
he
fell
into
while
waiting
for
his
breakfast
in
a
mirror
opposite
he
saw
his
face
it
did
not
look
haggard
it
looked
very
much
as
it
always
did
he
fancied
playing
a
part
through
life
hiding
a
broken
heart
under
a
smile
o
you
incorrigible
ass
he
said
to
himself
and
was
afraid
he
had
said
it
to
the
young
lady
who
brought
him
his
breakfast
and
looked
haughtily
at
him
from
under
her
bang
she
was
very
thin
and
wore
a
black
jersey
he
tried
to
find
out
whether
he
had
spoken
aloud
by
addressing
her
pleasantly
it
pretty
cold
this
what
say
pretty
oh
yes
but
it
pretty
she
replied
in
her
yankee
cantillation
she
went
away
and
left
him
to
the
bacon
and
eggs
he
had
ordered
at
random
there
was
a
fly
under
one
of
the
slices
of
bacon
and
mavering
confined
himself
to
the
coffee
a
man
came
up
in
a
white
cap
and
jacket
from
a
basement
in
the
front
of
the
restaurant
where
confectionery
was
sold
and
threw
down
a
mass
of
malleable
candy
on
a
marble
slab
and
began
to
work
it
mavering
watched
him
thinking
fuzzily
all
the
time
of
alice
and
holding
long
fatiguing
dialogues
with
the
people
at
the
whose
several
voices
he
heard
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
worse
than
yesterday
he
wondered
if
it
would
go
on
getting
worse
every
day
he
saw
a
man
pass
the
door
of
the
restaurant
who
looked
exactly
like
boardman
as
he
glanced
in
the
resemblance
was
explained
by
the
coming
back
and
proving
to
be
really
boardman
xxii
mavering
sprang
at
him
with
a
demand
for
the
reason
of
his
being
there
i
thought
it
was
you
as
i
passed
said
boardman
but
i
could
make
sure
so
dark
back
and
i
thought
it
was
you
but
i
could
believe
it
said
mavering
with
equal
force
cutting
short
an
interior
conversation
with
pasmer
which
had
begun
to
hold
itself
since
his
first
glimpse
of
boardman
i
came
down
here
to
do
a
sort
of
yacht
race
boardman
explained
going
to
be
a
yacht
race
better
have
some
breakfast
or
better
not
here
flies
under
your
rough
on
the
flies
said
boardman
snapping
the
bell
which
summoned
the
spectre
in
the
black
jersey
and
he
sat
down
what
are
you
doing
in
portland
mavering
told
him
and
then
boardman
asked
him
how
he
had
left
the
pasmers
mavering
needed
no
other
hint
to
speak
and
he
spoke
fully
while
boardman
listened
with
an
agreeable
silence
letting
the
hero
of
the
tale
break
into
groans
and
doleful
laughs
and
ease
his
heart
with
grotesque
inarticulate
noises
and
made
little
or
no
comments
by
the
time
his
breakfast
came
boardman
was
ready
to
say
i
suppose
it
was
so
much
of
a
i
did
either
said
mavering
when
i
left
boston
of
course
i
knew
i
was
going
down
there
to
see
her
but
when
i
got
there
it
kept
going
on
just
like
anything
else
up
to
the
last
moment
i
did
realise
till
it
came
to
the
worst
that
i
had
become
a
mere
well
you
wo
stay
so
said
boardman
making
the
first
vain
attempt
at
consolation
he
lifted
the
steak
he
had
ordered
and
peered
beneath
it
all
right
this
time
any
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
staying
so
replied
mavering
with
gloomy
rejection
of
the
comfort
offered
you
see
that
it
all
for
the
best
that
you
well
out
of
it
if
she
could
throw
you
over
after
leading
you
on
but
she
did
lead
me
on
exclaimed
mavering
do
you
understand
that
it
was
all
my
mistake
from
the
first
if
i
had
been
perfectly
besotted
i
should
have
seen
that
she
was
only
tolerating
me
do
you
see
why
hang
it
boardman
i
must
have
had
a
kind
of
consciousness
of
it
under
my
conceit
after
all
for
when
i
came
to
the
point
when
i
did
come
to
the
point
i
had
the
sand
to
stick
to
it
like
a
man
and
i
tried
to
get
her
to
help
me
yes
i
can
see
that
i
did
now
i
kept
fooling
about
and
fooling
about
and
it
was
because
i
had
that
sort
of
prescience
of
whatever
you
call
it
that
i
was
mistaken
about
it
from
the
very
he
wished
to
tell
boardman
about
the
events
of
the
night
before
but
he
could
not
he
said
to
himself
that
he
did
not
care
about
their
being
hardly
to
his
credit
but
he
did
not
choose
to
let
alice
seem
to
have
resented
anything
in
them
it
belittled
her
and
claimed
too
much
for
him
so
boardman
had
to
proceed
upon
a
partial
knowledge
of
the
facts
i
do
suppose
that
boomerang
way
of
yours
if
that
what
you
mean
was
of
much
use
he
said
use
it
ruined
me
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
how
are
you
going
to
presuppose
that
a
girl
like
miss
pasmer
is
interested
in
an
idiot
like
you
i
mean
me
of
mavering
broke
off
with
a
dolorous
laugh
and
if
you
ca
presuppose
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
it
comes
to
the
point
you
got
to
shillyshally
and
then
you
got
to
go
it
blind
i
tell
you
it
a
leap
in
the
well
then
if
you
got
yourself
to
blame
how
am
i
to
blame
i
should
like
to
know
retorted
mavering
rejecting
the
first
offer
from
another
of
the
censure
which
he
had
been
heaping
upon
himself
the
irritation
of
his
nerves
spoke
i
did
speak
out
at
last
when
it
was
too
late
well
let
it
all
go
he
groaned
aimlessly
i
do
care
but
she
is
to
blame
i
do
think
i
could
admire
anybody
very
much
who
admired
me
no
sir
she
did
just
right
i
was
a
fool
and
she
could
have
treated
me
oh
i
guess
it
come
out
all
right
said
boardman
abandoning
himself
to
mere
optimism
how
come
all
right
demanded
mavering
flattered
by
the
hope
he
refused
it
come
right
now
i
got
my
deserts
that
oh
no
you
have
what
harm
have
you
done
it
all
right
for
you
to
think
small
beer
of
yourself
and
i
do
see
how
you
could
think
anything
else
just
at
present
but
you
wait
awhile
when
did
it
happen
mavering
took
out
his
watch
one
day
one
hour
twenty
minutes
and
fifteen
seconds
sure
about
the
seconds
i
suppose
you
did
hang
round
a
great
while
afterward
well
people
do
generally
said
mavering
with
scorn
never
tried
it
said
boardman
looking
critically
at
his
fried
potatoes
before
venturing
upon
them
if
you
had
stayed
perhaps
she
might
have
changed
her
mind
he
added
as
if
encouraged
to
this
hopeful
view
by
the
result
of
his
scrutiny
where
did
you
get
your
fraudulent
reputation
for
boardman
retorted
mavering
who
had
followed
his
examination
of
the
potatoes
with
involuntary
interest
she
wo
change
her
mind
she
is
one
of
that
kind
but
she
the
one
woman
in
this
world
who
could
have
made
a
man
of
me
is
that
so
asked
boardman
lightly
well
she
is
a
she
divine
what
a
dress
that
was
she
had
on
class
day
i
never
think
what
she
has
on
she
makes
everything
perfect
and
then
makes
you
forget
she
got
style
there
no
mistake
about
style
sighed
mavering
but
he
attempted
no
exemplification
she
awfully
graceful
what
a
walk
she
got
oh
do
do
boardman
all
that
true
and
all
nothing
nothing
to
her
goodness
she
so
good
boardman
well
i
give
it
up
she
religious
you
would
think
that
may
be
you
imagine
a
pretty
girl
religious
and
she
all
the
more
intoxicating
when
she
serious
and
when
she
forgotten
your
whole
worthless
existence
she
ten
thousand
times
more
fascinating
than
and
other
girl
when
she
going
right
for
you
there
a
kind
of
look
comes
into
her
eyes
kind
of
absence
rapture
do
you
know
when
she
serious
that
brings
your
heart
right
into
your
mouth
she
makes
you
think
of
some
of
those
pictures
i
want
to
tell
you
what
she
said
the
other
day
at
a
picnic
when
we
were
off
getting
blueberries
and
you
understand
that
she
is
like
other
girls
that
she
has
a
soul
fall
of
of
you
know
what
boardman
she
has
high
thoughts
about
everything
i
do
believe
she
ever
had
a
mean
or
ignoble
impulse
she
could
in
the
business
of
imparting
his
ideas
confidentially
mavering
had
drawn
himself
across
the
table
toward
boardman
without
heed
to
what
was
on
it
look
out
you
be
into
my
steak
first
thing
you
oh
confound
your
steak
cried
mavering
pushing
the
dish
away
what
difference
does
it
make
i
lost
her
i
do
believe
you
lost
her
said
boardman
what
the
reason
you
do
retorted
mavering
with
contempt
because
if
she
the
serious
kind
of
a
girl
you
say
she
is
she
would
let
you
come
up
there
and
dangle
round
a
whole
fortnight
without
letting
you
know
she
did
like
it
unless
she
did
like
it
now
you
just
go
a
little
into
mavering
was
quite
willing
he
went
so
much
into
detail
that
he
left
nothing
to
boardman
imagination
he
lost
the
sense
of
its
calamitous
close
in
recounting
the
facts
of
his
story
at
campobello
he
smiled
and
blushed
and
laughed
in
telling
certain
things
he
described
miss
anderson
and
imitated
her
voice
he
drew
heads
of
some
of
the
ladies
on
the
margin
of
a
newspaper
and
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
when
he
repeated
the
cruel
words
which
alice
had
used
at
their
last
meeting
oh
well
you
must
brace
up
said
boardman
i
got
to
go
now
she
did
mean
it
of
mean
what
that
you
were
ungentlemanly
women
do
know
half
the
time
how
hard
they
i
guess
she
meant
that
she
did
want
me
anyway
said
mavering
gloomily
ah
i
do
know
about
that
you
better
ask
her
the
next
time
you
see
her
he
had
risen
and
he
offered
his
hand
to
mavering
who
was
still
seated
why
i
half
a
mind
to
go
with
all
right
come
along
but
i
thought
you
might
be
going
right
on
to
no
i
wait
and
go
on
with
you
how
do
you
go
to
the
race
in
the
press
any
women
no
we
do
send
them
on
this
sort
of
that
settles
it
i
have
got
all
i
want
of
that
particular
sex
for
the
time
mavering
wore
a
very
bitter
air
as
he
said
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
always
be
cynical
he
rose
and
arranged
to
leave
his
bag
with
the
restaurateur
who
put
it
under
the
counter
and
then
he
went
out
with
his
friend
the
sun
had
come
out
and
the
fog
was
burning
away
there
was
life
and
lift
in
the
air
which
the
rejected
lover
could
not
refuse
to
feel
and
he
said
looking
round
and
up
and
down
the
animated
street
i
guess
you
going
to
have
a
good
day
for
the
pavement
was
pretty
well
filled
with
women
who
had
begun
shopping
carriages
were
standing
beside
the
pavement
a
lady
crossed
the
pavement
from
a
shop
door
toward
a
coupe
just
in
front
of
them
with
her
hand
full
of
light
packages
she
dropped
one
of
them
and
mavering
sprang
forward
instinctively
and
picked
it
up
for
her
oh
thank
you
she
said
with
the
deep
gratitude
which
society
cultivates
for
the
smallest
services
then
she
lifted
her
drooped
eyelashes
and
with
a
flash
of
surprise
exclaimed
mr
mavering
and
dropped
all
her
packages
that
she
might
shake
hands
with
him
boardman
sauntered
slowly
on
but
saw
with
a
backward
glance
mavering
carrying
the
lady
packages
to
the
coupe
for
her
saw
him
lift
his
hat
there
and
shake
hands
with
somebody
in
the
coupe
and
then
stand
talking
beside
it
he
waited
at
the
corner
of
the
block
for
mavering
to
come
up
affecting
an
interest
in
the
of
a
furnisher
window
in
about
five
minutes
mavering
joined
him
look
here
boardman
those
ladies
have
snagged
onto
are
there
two
of
them
yes
one
inside
and
they
want
me
to
go
with
then
to
see
the
race
their
father
got
a
little
they
want
you
to
go
boardman
shook
his
head
well
that
what
i
told
them
told
them
that
you
had
to
go
on
the
press
boat
they
said
they
wished
they
were
going
on
the
press
boat
too
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
refuse
they
ladies
that
i
met
class
day
and
i
ought
to
have
shown
them
a
little
more
attention
then
but
i
got
so
taken
up
with
i
see
said
boardman
showing
his
teeth
fine
and
even
as
grains
of
in
a
slight
sarcastic
smile
sort
of
poetical
justice
he
suggested
well
it
is
sort
of
said
mavering
with
a
shamefaced
consciousness
what
train
are
you
going
back
on
seven
i
be
he
hurried
back
to
rejoin
the
ladies
and
boardman
saw
him
after
some
parley
and
laughter
get
into
the
coupe
from
which
he
inferred
that
they
had
turned
down
the
little
seat
in
front
and
made
him
take
it
and
he
inferred
that
they
must
be
very
jolly
sociable
girls
he
did
not
see
mavering
again
till
the
train
was
on
its
way
when
he
came
in
looking
distraughtly
about
for
his
friend
he
was
again
very
melancholy
and
said
dejectedly
that
they
had
made
him
stay
to
dinner
and
had
then
driven
him
down
to
the
station
bag
and
all
the
old
gentleman
came
too
i
was
in
hopes
i
find
you
hanging
round
somewhere
so
that
i
could
introduce
you
they
awfully
nice
none
of
that
infernal
boston
stiffness
the
one
you
saw
me
talking
with
is
married
boardman
was
writing
out
his
report
from
a
little
book
with
shorthand
notes
in
it
there
were
half
a
dozen
other
reporters
in
the
car
busy
with
their
work
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
in
authority
said
to
one
of
them
try
to
throw
in
a
little
mavering
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
leaned
his
head
on
the
back
of
his
seat
and
tried
to
sleep
xxiii
at
his
father
agency
in
boston
he
found
the
next
morning
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
expected
to
be
down
that
day
and
asking
dan
to
meet
him
at
the
parker
house
for
dinner
the
letter
intimated
the
elder
mavering
expectation
that
his
son
had
reached
some
conclusion
in
the
matter
they
had
talked
of
before
he
left
for
campobello
it
gave
dan
a
shiver
of
and
a
sick
feeling
of
hopelessness
he
was
quite
willing
now
to
do
whatever
his
father
wished
but
he
did
not
see
haw
he
could
face
him
and
own
his
defeat
when
they
met
his
father
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
despondency
and
he
asked
him
nothing
about
the
pasmers
of
course
that
would
not
have
been
the
american
way
nothing
had
been
said
between
the
father
and
son
as
to
the
special
advantages
of
campobello
for
the
decision
of
the
question
pending
when
they
saw
each
other
last
but
the
son
knew
that
the
father
guessed
why
he
chose
that
island
for
the
purpose
and
now
the
elder
knew
that
if
the
younger
had
anything
to
tell
him
he
would
tell
it
and
if
he
had
not
he
would
keep
it
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
there
was
no
objection
on
the
father
part
to
miss
pasmer
in
fact
there
had
been
a
glimmer
of
humorous
intelligence
in
his
eye
when
the
son
said
he
thought
he
should
run
down
to
bar
harbour
and
perhaps
to
campobello
but
he
had
said
nothing
to
betray
his
consciousness
they
met
in
the
at
parker
and
dan
said
hello
father
and
his
father
answered
well
dan
and
they
shyly
touched
the
hands
dropped
at
their
sides
as
they
pressed
together
in
the
crowd
the
father
gave
his
boy
a
keen
glance
and
then
took
the
lead
into
the
where
he
chose
a
corner
table
and
they
disposed
of
their
hats
on
the
all
well
at
home
asked
the
young
fellow
as
he
took
up
the
bill
of
fare
to
order
the
dinner
his
father
hated
that
and
always
made
him
do
it
yes
yes
as
usual
i
believe
minnie
is
off
for
a
week
at
the
mountains
eunice
is
at
oh
how
would
you
like
some
green
goose
with
and
succotash
it
seems
to
me
that
was
pretty
good
the
last
time
all
right
if
you
like
i
do
know
that
i
care
for
anything
much
i
a
little
off
my
feed
no
soup
he
said
looking
up
at
the
waiter
bending
over
him
and
then
he
gave
the
order
i
think
you
may
bring
me
half
a
dozen
blue
points
if
they
good
he
called
after
him
did
bar
harbour
agree
with
you
or
campobello
asked
mavering
taking
the
opening
offered
him
no
not
very
well
said
dan
and
he
said
no
more
about
it
leaving
his
father
to
make
his
own
inferences
as
to
the
kind
or
degree
of
the
disagreement
well
have
you
made
up
your
mind
asked
the
father
resting
his
elbows
on
either
side
of
his
plate
and
putting
his
hands
together
softly
while
he
looked
across
them
with
a
cheery
kindness
at
his
boy
yes
i
have
said
dan
slowly
well
i
do
believe
i
care
to
go
into
the
sure
well
that
all
right
then
i
wished
you
to
choose
freely
and
i
suppose
you
done
oh
i
think
you
chosen
wisely
and
i
very
glad
it
a
weight
off
my
mind
i
think
you
be
happier
in
the
business
than
you
would
in
the
law
i
think
you
enjoy
it
you
need
look
forward
to
a
great
deal
of
ponkwasset
falls
unless
you
i
should
mind
going
there
said
dan
listlessly
it
wo
be
necessary
at
first
in
fact
it
wo
be
desirable
i
want
you
to
look
up
the
business
at
this
end
a
dan
gave
a
start
in
boston
yes
it
is
in
the
shape
i
want
to
have
it
i
propose
to
open
a
place
of
our
own
and
to
put
you
in
something
in
the
young
face
expressed
reluctance
and
his
father
asked
kindly
would
that
be
distasteful
to
you
oh
no
it
is
the
thing
i
object
to
but
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
be
in
he
lifted
his
face
and
looked
his
father
full
in
the
eyes
but
with
a
gaze
that
refused
to
convey
anything
definite
then
the
father
knew
that
the
boy
love
affair
had
gone
seriously
wrong
the
waiter
came
with
the
dinner
and
made
an
interruption
in
which
they
could
be
naturally
silent
when
he
had
put
the
dinner
before
them
and
cumbered
them
with
superfluous
service
after
the
fashion
of
his
kind
he
withdrew
a
little
way
and
left
them
to
resume
their
talk
well
said
the
elder
lightly
as
if
dan
not
caring
to
be
in
boston
had
no
particular
significance
for
him
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
have
you
settle
down
to
it
immediately
i
rather
think
i
like
to
have
you
look
about
first
a
little
go
to
new
york
go
to
philadelphia
and
see
their
processes
there
we
ca
afford
to
get
in
our
ways
i
always
been
more
interested
by
the
aesthetic
side
of
the
business
but
you
ought
to
have
a
taste
for
the
mechanism
from
your
grandfather
your
mother
has
oh
yes
sir
i
think
all
that
very
interesting
said
dan
well
go
to
france
and
see
how
those
fellows
do
it
go
to
london
and
look
up
william
yes
that
would
be
very
nice
admitted
the
young
fellow
beginning
to
catch
on
but
i
did
suppose
i
did
expect
to
begin
life
with
a
he
entered
upon
his
sentence
with
a
jocular
buoyancy
but
at
the
last
word
which
he
fatally
drifted
upon
his
voice
fell
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
greatly
changed
that
he
should
never
be
gay
and
bright
again
there
would
always
be
this
undercurrent
of
sadness
he
had
noticed
the
undercurrent
yesterday
when
he
was
laughing
and
joking
with
those
girls
at
portland
oh
i
do
want
you
to
buckle
down
at
once
said
his
father
smiling
if
you
decided
upon
the
law
i
should
have
felt
that
you
better
not
lose
time
but
as
you
going
into
the
business
i
do
mind
your
taking
a
year
off
it
wo
be
lost
time
if
you
keep
your
eyes
open
i
think
you
better
go
down
into
italy
and
spain
look
up
the
old
tapestries
and
stamped
leathers
you
may
get
some
ideas
how
would
you
like
it
i
should
like
it
said
dan
rising
on
the
waft
of
his
father
suggestion
but
gloomily
lapsing
again
still
it
was
pleasing
to
picture
himself
going
about
through
europe
with
a
broken
heart
and
he
did
not
deny
himself
the
consolation
of
the
vision
well
there
nobody
to
dislike
it
said
his
father
cheerily
he
was
sure
now
that
dan
had
been
jilted
otherwise
he
would
have
put
forth
some
objection
to
a
scheme
which
must
interrupt
his
lovemaking
no
reason
why
with
our
resources
we
should
take
the
lead
in
this
he
went
on
to
speak
more
fully
of
his
plans
and
dan
listened
with
a
nether
reference
of
it
all
to
alice
but
still
with
a
surface
intelligence
on
which
nothing
was
lost
are
you
going
home
with
me
asked
his
father
as
they
rose
from
the
table
well
perhaps
not
i
got
some
of
my
things
to
put
together
in
cambridge
yet
and
perhaps
i
better
look
after
them
but
a
notion
i
better
spend
the
winter
at
home
and
get
an
idea
of
the
manufacture
before
i
go
abroad
i
might
sail
in
january
they
say
it
a
good
yes
there
sense
in
that
said
his
father
and
perhaps
i
wo
break
up
in
cambridge
till
i
been
to
new
york
and
philadelphia
what
do
you
think
it
easier
striking
them
from
i
do
know
but
you
right
said
his
father
easily
they
had
come
out
of
the
and
dan
stopped
to
get
some
cigarettes
in
the
office
he
looked
mechanically
at
the
theatre
bills
over
the
cigar
case
i
see
irving
at
the
oh
you
do
say
said
his
father
let
go
and
see
if
you
wish
it
sir
said
dan
with
pensive
acquiescence
all
the
maverings
were
fond
of
the
theatre
and
made
any
mood
the
occasion
or
the
pretext
of
going
to
the
play
if
they
were
sad
they
went
if
they
were
gay
they
went
as
long
as
dan
mother
could
get
she
used
to
have
herself
carried
to
a
box
in
the
theatre
whenever
she
was
in
town
now
that
she
no
longer
left
her
room
she
had
a
dominant
passion
for
hearing
about
actors
and
acting
it
was
almost
a
work
of
piety
in
her
husband
and
children
to
see
them
and
report
to
her
his
father
left
him
the
next
afternoon
and
dan
who
had
spent
the
day
with
him
looking
into
business
for
the
first
time
with
a
running
accompaniment
of
alice
in
all
the
details
remained
to
uninterrupted
misery
he
spent
the
evening
in
his
room
too
wretched
even
for
the
theatre
it
is
true
that
he
tried
to
find
boardman
but
boardman
was
again
off
on
some
newspaper
duty
and
after
trying
at
several
houses
in
the
hope
which
he
knew
was
vain
of
finding
any
one
in
town
yet
he
shut
himself
up
with
his
thoughts
they
did
not
differ
from
the
thoughts
of
the
night
before
and
the
night
before
that
but
they
were
calmer
and
they
portended
more
distinctly
a
life
of
and
solitude
from
that
time
forth
he
tested
his
feelings
and
found
that
it
was
not
hurt
vanity
that
he
was
suffering
from
it
was
really
wounded
affection
he
did
not
resent
alice
cruelty
he
wished
that
she
might
be
happy
he
could
endure
to
see
her
happy
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
married
one
of
the
two
ladies
he
had
spent
the
day
with
in
portland
and
thanked
them
for
making
pass
pleasantly
a
day
which
he
would
not
otherwise
have
known
how
to
get
through
he
let
a
soft
mysterious
melancholy
pervade
his
letter
he
hinted
darkly
at
trouble
and
sorrow
of
which
he
could
not
definitely
speak
he
had
the
good
sense
to
tear
his
letter
up
when
he
had
finished
it
and
to
send
a
short
sprightly
note
instead
saying
that
if
frobisher
and
her
sister
came
to
boston
at
the
end
of
the
month
as
they
had
spoken
of
doing
they
must
be
sure
to
let
him
know
upon
the
impulse
given
him
by
this
letter
he
went
more
cheerfully
to
bed
and
fell
instantly
asleep
during
the
next
three
weeks
he
bent
himself
faithfully
to
the
schemes
of
work
his
father
had
outlined
for
him
he
visited
new
york
and
philadelphia
and
looked
into
the
business
and
the
processes
there
and
he
returned
to
ponkwasset
falls
to
report
and
compare
his
facts
intelligently
with
those
which
he
now
examined
in
his
manufactory
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
understand
how
his
father
who
was
a
man
of
intellectual
and
artistic
interests
should
be
fond
of
the
work
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
with
his
mother
and
read
to
her
and
got
upon
better
terms
with
her
than
they
usually
were
they
were
very
much
alike
and
she
objected
to
him
that
he
was
too
light
and
frivolous
he
sat
with
his
sisters
and
took
an
interest
in
their
pursuits
he
drove
them
about
with
his
father
sorrels
and
resumed
something
of
the
old
relations
with
them
which
the
selfish
years
of
his
college
life
had
broken
off
as
yet
he
could
not
speak
of
campobello
or
of
what
had
happened
there
and
his
mother
and
sisters
whatever
they
thought
made
no
more
allusion
to
it
than
his
father
had
done
they
mercifully
took
it
for
granted
that
matters
must
have
gone
wrong
there
or
else
he
would
speak
about
them
for
there
had
been
some
gay
banter
among
them
concerning
the
objects
of
his
expedition
before
he
left
home
they
had
heard
of
the
heroine
of
his
class
day
and
they
had
their
doubts
of
her
such
as
girls
have
of
their
brothers
heroines
they
were
not
inconsolably
sorry
to
have
her
prove
unkind
and
their
mother
found
in
the
probable
event
another
proof
of
their
father
total
want
of
discernment
where
women
were
concerned
for
the
elder
mavering
had
come
home
from
class
day
about
as
much
smitten
with
this
mysterious
miss
pasmer
as
dan
was
she
talked
it
over
indignantly
with
her
daughters
they
were
glad
of
dan
escape
but
they
were
incensed
with
the
girl
who
could
let
him
escape
and
they
inculpated
her
in
a
high
degree
of
heartless
flirtation
they
knew
how
sweet
dan
was
and
they
believed
him
most
sincere
and
good
he
had
been
brilliantly
popular
in
college
and
he
was
as
bright
as
he
could
be
what
was
it
she
chose
not
to
like
in
him
they
vexed
themselves
with
asking
how
or
in
what
way
she
thought
herself
better
they
would
not
have
had
her
love
dan
but
they
were
hot
against
her
for
not
loving
him
they
did
not
question
him
but
they
tried
in
every
way
to
find
out
how
much
he
was
hurt
and
they
watched
him
in
every
word
and
look
for
signs
of
change
to
better
or
worse
with
a
growing
belief
that
he
was
not
very
much
hurt
it
could
not
be
said
that
in
three
weeks
he
forgot
alice
or
had
begun
to
forget
her
but
he
had
begun
to
reconcile
himself
to
his
fate
as
people
do
in
their
bereavements
by
death
his
consciousness
habituated
itself
to
the
facts
as
something
irretrievable
he
no
longer
framed
in
his
mind
situations
in
which
the
past
was
restored
he
knew
that
he
should
never
love
again
but
he
had
moments
and
more
and
more
of
them
in
which
he
experienced
that
life
had
objects
besides
love
there
were
times
when
he
tingled
with
all
the
anguish
of
the
first
moment
of
his
rejection
when
he
stopped
in
whatever
he
was
doing
or
stood
as
a
man
does
when
arrested
by
a
physical
pang
breathless
waiting
there
were
other
times
when
he
went
about
steeped
in
gloom
so
black
that
all
the
world
darkened
with
it
and
some
mornings
when
he
woke
he
wished
that
the
night
had
lasted
for
ever
and
felt
as
if
the
daylight
had
uncovered
his
misery
and
his
shame
to
every
one
he
never
knew
when
he
should
have
these
moods
and
he
thought
he
should
have
them
as
long
as
he
lived
he
thought
this
would
be
something
rather
fine
he
had
still
other
moods
in
which
he
saw
an
old
man
with
a
grey
moustache
like
colonel
newcome
meeting
a
beautiful
lady
the
man
had
never
married
and
he
had
not
seen
this
lady
for
fifty
years
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hand
you
idiot
said
mavering
to
himself
throughout
he
kept
a
good
appetite
in
fact
after
that
first
morning
in
portland
he
had
been
hungry
three
times
a
day
with
perfect
regularity
he
lost
the
idea
of
being
sick
he
had
not
even
a
furred
tongue
he
fell
asleep
pretty
early
and
he
slept
through
the
night
without
a
break
he
had
to
laugh
a
great
deal
with
his
mother
and
sisters
since
he
could
not
very
well
mope
without
expecting
them
to
ask
why
and
he
did
not
wish
to
say
why
but
there
were
some
laughs
which
he
really
enjoyed
with
the
yankee
foreman
of
the
works
who
was
a
droll
after
a
common
american
pattern
and
said
things
that
were
killingly
funny
especially
about
women
of
whom
his
opinions
were
sarcastic
dan
mavering
suffered
but
not
solidly
his
suffering
was
short
and
crossed
with
many
gleams
of
respite
and
even
joy
his
disappointment
made
him
really
unhappy
but
not
wholly
so
it
was
a
genuine
sorrow
but
a
sorrow
to
which
he
began
to
resign
himself
even
in
the
monotony
of
ponkwasset
falls
and
which
admitted
the
thought
of
sister
by
the
time
business
called
him
to
boston
xxiv
before
the
end
of
the
first
week
after
dan
came
back
to
town
that
which
was
likely
to
happen
whenever
chance
brought
him
and
alice
together
had
taken
place
it
was
one
of
the
soft
days
that
fall
in
late
october
when
the
impending
winter
seems
stayed
and
the
warm
breath
of
the
land
draws
seaward
and
over
a
thousand
miles
of
indian
summer
the
bloom
came
and
went
in
quick
pulses
over
the
girl
temples
as
she
sat
with
her
head
thrown
back
in
the
corner
of
the
car
and
from
moment
to
moment
she
stirred
slightly
as
if
some
stress
of
rapture
made
it
hard
for
her
to
get
her
breath
a
little
gleam
of
light
fell
from
under
her
fallen
eyelids
into
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
beside
her
who
leaned
forward
slightly
and
slanted
his
face
upward
to
meet
her
glances
they
said
some
words
now
and
then
indistinguishable
to
the
others
in
speaking
they
smiled
slightly
sometimes
her
hand
wavered
across
her
lap
in
both
their
faces
there
was
something
beyond
happiness
a
transport
a
passion
the
brief
splendour
of
a
supreme
moment
they
left
the
car
at
the
arlington
street
corner
of
the
public
garden
and
followed
the
winding
paths
diagonally
to
the
further
corner
on
charles
street
how
stupid
we
were
to
get
into
that
ridiculous
she
said
what
in
the
world
possessed
us
to
do
it
i
ca
imagine
he
answered
what
a
waste
of
time
it
was
if
we
had
walked
we
might
have
been
twice
as
long
coming
and
now
you
going
to
send
me
off
so
soon
i
do
send
you
she
murmured
but
you
want
me
to
oh
no
but
you
i
ca
do
anything
against
your
i
wish
it
for
your
own
ah
do
let
me
go
home
with
you
alice
do
ask
it
or
i
must
say
part
of
the
way
then
no
not
a
step
you
must
take
the
first
car
for
cambridge
what
time
is
it
now
you
can
see
by
the
clock
on
the
providence
but
i
wish
you
to
go
by
your
watch
now
look
alice
he
cried
in
pure
rapture
look
it
a
quarter
of
and
we
been
three
hours
together
already
now
you
must
simply
fly
if
you
came
home
with
me
i
should
be
sure
to
let
you
come
in
and
if
i
do
see
mamma
alone
first
i
shall
die
ca
you
understand
no
but
i
can
do
the
next
best
thing
i
can
misunderstand
you
want
to
be
rid
of
shall
you
be
rid
of
me
when
we
parted
she
asked
with
an
inner
thrill
of
earnestness
in
her
gay
tone
alice
you
know
i
did
mean
it
say
it
what
dan
love
dan
dearest
will
that
car
of
yours
never
come
i
promised
myself
not
to
leave
you
till
it
does
and
if
i
stay
here
any
longer
i
shall
go
wild
i
believe
it
happened
say
it
again
say
what
that
that
i
love
you
that
we
engaged
i
do
believe
it
i
she
looked
impatiently
up
the
street
oh
there
comes
your
car
run
stop
it
i
do
run
to
stop
he
made
a
sign
which
the
conductor
obeyed
and
the
car
halted
at
the
further
crossing
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
it
and
made
no
movement
to
dismiss
him
oh
does
it
seem
too
good
to
be
standing
here
talking
in
this
way
and
people
think
it
about
the
weather
or
society
she
set
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
twirled
the
open
parasol
on
her
shoulder
yes
it
does
tell
me
it
true
love
it
true
how
splendid
you
are
she
said
it
with
an
effect
for
the
world
outside
of
saying
it
was
a
lovely
day
he
retorted
with
the
same
apparent
nonchalance
how
beautiful
you
are
how
good
how
divine
the
conductor
seeing
himself
apparently
forgotten
gave
his
bell
a
vicious
snap
and
his
car
jolted
away
she
started
nervously
there
you
lost
your
car
have
i
asked
mavering
without
troubling
himself
to
look
after
it
she
laughed
now
with
a
faint
suggestion
of
unwillingness
in
her
laugh
what
are
you
going
to
do
walk
home
with
no
indeed
you
know
i
ca
let
and
are
you
going
to
leave
me
here
alone
on
the
street
corner
to
be
run
over
by
the
first
bicycle
that
comes
along
you
can
sit
down
in
the
garden
and
wait
for
the
next
no
i
would
rather
go
back
to
the
art
museum
and
make
a
fresh
to
the
art
museum
she
murmured
tenderly
yes
would
you
like
to
see
it
again
again
i
should
like
to
pass
my
whole
life
in
it
well
walk
back
with
me
a
little
way
there
no
hurry
about
the
dan
she
said
in
a
helpless
compliance
and
they
paced
very
very
slowly
along
the
beacon
street
path
in
the
garden
this
is
yes
but
it
yes
that
what
i
meant
do
you
suppose
any
one
ever
ever
made
love
there
before
how
can
you
say
such
things
yes
i
always
supposed
it
would
be
somewhere
it
was
somewhere
else
oh
i
meant
the
second
then
you
did
think
there
was
going
to
be
a
second
time
how
do
i
know
i
wished
it
do
you
like
me
to
say
that
i
wish
you
would
never
say
anything
yes
there
ca
be
any
harm
in
it
now
i
thought
that
if
you
had
ever
liked
me
you
would
still
so
did
i
but
i
could
believe
that
you
oh
i
alice
do
you
like
my
confessing
it
you
asked
me
like
it
how
silly
we
are
not
half
so
silly
as
we
been
for
the
last
two
months
i
think
just
come
to
our
senses
at
least
i
two
months
she
sighed
has
it
really
been
so
long
as
that
two
years
two
centuries
it
was
back
in
the
dark
ages
when
you
refused
dark
ages
i
should
think
so
but
do
say
refused
it
refusing
what
was
it
then
oh
i
do
know
do
speak
of
it
but
alice
why
did
you
refuse
me
oh
i
do
know
you
must
ask
me
now
i
tell
you
some
well
come
to
think
of
it
said
mavering
laughing
it
all
lightly
away
there
no
hurry
tell
me
why
you
accepted
me
i
i
could
help
it
when
i
saw
you
i
wanted
to
fall
at
your
what
an
idea
i
did
want
to
fall
at
yours
i
was
awfully
mad
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
if
you
had
stopped
me
and
held
out
your
really
did
you
really
hate
me
dan
well
i
have
exactly
doted
on
you
since
we
last
she
did
not
seem
offended
at
this
yes
i
suppose
so
and
i
gone
on
being
fonder
and
fonder
of
you
every
minute
since
that
day
i
wanted
to
call
you
back
when
you
had
got
to
i
would
have
come
it
bad
luck
to
turn
she
laughed
at
his
drolling
how
funny
you
are
now
i
of
rather
a
gloomy
temperament
did
you
know
it
you
do
look
oh
but
i
am
just
now
i
rather
excited
and
so
glad
go
on
go
on
i
like
you
to
make
fun
of
the
benches
on
either
side
were
filled
with
nursemaids
in
charge
of
and
of
young
children
who
were
digging
in
the
sand
with
their
little
beach
shovels
and
playing
their
games
back
and
forth
across
the
walk
unrebuked
by
the
indulgent
policemen
a
number
of
them
had
enclosed
a
square
in
the
middle
of
the
path
with
four
of
the
benches
which
they
made
believe
was
a
fort
the
lovers
had
to
walk
round
it
and
the
children
chasing
one
another
dashed
into
them
headlong
or
backing
off
from
pursuit
bumped
up
against
them
they
did
not
seem
to
know
it
but
walked
slowly
on
without
noticing
they
were
not
aware
of
an
occasional
benchful
of
rather
shabby
young
fellows
who
stared
hard
at
the
stylish
girl
and
young
man
talking
together
in
such
intense
low
tones
with
rapid
interchange
of
radiant
glances
oh
as
to
making
fun
of
you
i
was
going
to
say
mavering
began
and
after
a
pause
he
broke
off
with
a
laugh
i
forget
what
i
was
going
to
try
to
i
how
strange
that
we
should
have
both
happened
to
go
to
the
museum
this
morning
she
sighed
then
dan
she
broke
in
do
you
suppose
that
heaven
is
any
different
from
this
i
hope
not
if
i
to
go
hush
dear
you
must
talk
why
you
provoked
me
to
did
i
did
i
really
do
you
think
i
tempted
you
to
do
it
then
i
must
be
wicked
whether
i
knew
i
was
doing
it
or
not
the
break
in
her
voice
made
him
look
more
keenly
at
her
and
he
saw
the
tears
glimmer
in
her
eyes
alice
no
i
not
good
enough
for
you
i
always
said
then
do
say
it
any
more
that
the
only
thing
i
wo
let
you
do
you
forbid
it
really
wo
you
let
me
even
think
it
no
not
even
think
how
lovely
you
are
oh
i
like
to
be
commanded
by
do
you
you
have
lots
of
fun
then
i
an
awfully
commanding
i
did
suppose
you
were
so
humorous
always
i
afraid
you
like
me
i
no
sense
of
and
i
a
little
too
funny
sometimes
i
no
you
never
are
when
that
night
at
the
trevors
you
did
like
i
thought
miss
anderson
was
rather
ridiculous
said
alice
i
like
buffoonery
in
nor
i
in
men
said
mavering
smiling
i
dropped
well
now
we
must
part
i
must
go
home
at
once
said
alice
perfectly
oh
no
not
yet
not
till
we
said
something
else
not
till
changed
the
what
subject
miss
alice
laughed
and
blushed
but
she
was
not
vexed
she
liked
to
have
him
understand
her
well
now
she
said
as
if
that
were
the
next
thing
i
going
to
cross
here
at
once
and
walk
up
the
other
pavement
and
you
must
go
back
through
the
garden
or
else
i
shall
never
get
away
from
may
i
look
over
at
you
you
may
glance
but
you
need
expect
me
to
return
your
oh
and
i
want
you
to
take
the
very
first
cambridge
car
that
comes
along
i
command
you
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
do
the
so
i
do
in
essentials
if
you
command
me
not
to
cry
when
i
get
home
i
she
looked
at
him
with
an
ecstasy
of
in
her
eyes
ah
i
do
that
i
ca
tell
what
would
open
but
alice
well
what
she
drifted
closely
to
him
and
looked
fondly
up
into
his
face
in
walking
they
had
insensibly
drawn
nearer
together
and
she
had
been
obliged
constantly
to
put
space
between
them
now
standing
at
the
corner
of
arlington
street
and
looking
tentatively
across
beacon
she
abandoned
all
precautions
what
i
forget
oh
yes
i
love
you
but
you
said
that
before
dearest
yes
but
just
now
it
struck
me
as
a
very
novel
idea
what
if
your
mother
should
like
the
idea
nonsense
you
know
she
perfectly
idolises
you
she
did
from
the
first
and
does
she
know
how
i
begin
behaving
about
you
ever
since
i
lost
you
how
have
you
behaved
do
tell
me
alice
some
time
not
now
she
said
and
with
something
that
was
like
a
gasp
and
threatened
to
be
a
sob
she
suddenly
whipped
across
the
road
he
walked
back
to
charles
street
by
the
garden
path
keeping
abreast
of
her
and
not
losing
sight
of
her
for
a
moment
except
when
the
bulk
of
a
string
team
watering
at
the
trough
beside
the
pavement
intervened
he
hurried
by
and
when
he
had
passed
it
he
found
himself
exactly
abreast
of
her
again
her
face
was
turned
toward
him
they
exchanged
a
smile
lost
in
space
at
the
corner
of
charles
street
he
deliberately
crossed
over
to
her
o
dearest
love
why
did
you
come
she
implored
because
you
signed
to
i
hoped
you
would
see
it
if
we
both
to
be
so
weak
as
this
what
are
we
going
to
do
but
i
glad
you
came
yes
i
was
frightened
they
must
have
overheard
us
there
when
we
were
well
i
did
say
anything
i
ashamed
of
besides
i
should
care
much
for
the
opinion
of
those
nurses
and
of
course
not
but
people
must
have
seen
us
do
stand
here
talking
dan
do
come
on
she
hurried
him
across
the
street
and
walked
him
swiftly
up
the
incline
of
beacon
street
there
in
her
new
fall
suit
with
him
faultlessly
gloved
at
a
fit
distance
from
her
side
she
felt
more
in
keeping
with
the
social
frame
of
things
than
in
the
garden
path
which
was
really
only
a
shade
better
than
the
beacon
street
mall
of
the
common
do
you
suppose
anybody
saw
us
that
knew
us
i
hope
so
do
you
want
people
to
know
it
yes
of
course
they
will
have
to
know
it
in
the
right
way
can
you
believe
that
it
only
half
a
year
since
we
met
it
wo
be
a
year
till
class
i
do
believe
it
alice
i
ca
recollect
anything
before
i
knew
well
now
as
time
is
so
confused
we
must
try
to
live
for
eternity
we
must
try
to
help
each
other
to
be
good
oh
when
i
think
what
a
happy
girl
i
am
i
feel
that
i
should
be
the
most
ungrateful
person
under
the
sun
not
to
be
good
let
try
to
make
our
lives
perfect
perfect
they
can
be
and
we
must
live
for
each
other
alone
we
must
try
to
do
good
as
well
as
be
good
we
must
be
kind
and
forbearing
with
every
he
answered
with
tender
seriousness
my
life
in
your
hands
alice
it
shall
be
whatever
you
they
were
both
silent
in
their
deep
belief
of
this
when
they
spoke
again
she
began
gaily
i
shall
never
get
over
the
wonder
of
it
how
strange
that
we
should
meet
at
the
museum
they
had
both
said
this
already
but
that
did
not
matter
they
had
said
nearly
everything
two
or
three
times
how
did
you
happen
to
be
there
she
asked
and
the
question
was
so
novel
that
she
added
i
have
asked
you
he
stopped
with
a
look
of
dismay
that
broke
up
in
a
hopeless
laugh
why
i
went
there
to
meet
some
people
some
ladies
and
when
i
saw
you
i
forgot
all
about
alice
laughed
to
this
was
a
part
of
their
joy
their
triumph
who
are
they
she
asked
indifferently
and
only
to
heighten
the
absurdity
by
realising
the
persons
you
do
know
them
he
said
mrs
frobisher
and
her
sister
of
portland
i
promised
to
meet
them
there
and
go
out
to
cambridge
with
what
will
they
think
asked
alice
it
too
they
think
i
did
come
said
mavering
with
the
easy
conscience
of
youth
and
love
and
again
they
laughed
at
the
ridiculous
position
together
i
remember
now
i
was
to
be
at
the
door
and
they
were
to
take
me
up
in
their
carriage
i
wonder
how
long
they
waited
you
put
everything
else
out
of
my
do
you
think
i
keep
it
out
she
asked
archly
oh
yes
there
is
nothing
else
but
you
the
eyes
that
she
dropped
after
a
glance
at
him
glistened
with
tears
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
do
you
suppose
he
asked
huskily
that
we
can
ever
misunderstand
each
other
again
never
i
see
everything
clearly
now
we
shall
trust
each
other
implicitly
and
at
the
least
thing
that
is
clear
we
can
speak
promise
me
that
you
i
will
alice
but
after
this
all
will
be
clear
we
shall
deal
with
each
other
as
we
do
with
yes
that
will
be
the
and
we
must
wait
for
question
from
each
other
we
shall
know
we
shall
feel
when
there
any
misgiving
and
then
the
one
that
caused
it
will
yes
she
sighed
emphatically
how
perfectly
you
say
it
but
because
you
feel
it
because
you
are
they
walked
on
treading
the
air
in
a
transport
of
fondness
for
each
other
suddenly
he
stopped
miss
pasmer
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
you
letting
me
go
home
with
am
i
how
noble
of
you
to
tell
me
dan
for
i
know
you
do
want
to
tell
well
i
might
as
well
but
i
let
you
come
in
you
try
will
you
promise
me
you
wo
i
shall
only
want
to
come
in
the
first
what
for
what
for
oh
for
half
a
she
turned
away
her
face
he
went
on
this
engagement
has
been
such
a
very
public
affair
so
far
that
i
think
i
like
to
see
my
fiancee
alone
for
a
i
do
know
what
in
the
world
you
can
have
to
say
he
went
into
the
first
door
with
her
and
then
he
went
with
her
upstairs
to
the
door
of
pasmer
apartment
the
passages
of
the
cavendish
were
not
well
lighted
the
little
lane
or
alley
that
led
down
to
this
door
from
the
stairs
landing
was
very
dim
so
dark
here
murmured
alice
in
a
low
voice
somewhat
tremulous
but
not
too
xxv
she
burst
into
the
room
where
her
mother
sat
looking
over
some
housekeeping
accounts
his
kiss
and
his
name
were
upon
her
lips
her
soul
was
full
of
him
mamma
she
panted
her
mother
did
not
look
round
she
could
have
had
no
premonition
of
the
vital
news
that
her
daughter
was
bringing
and
she
went
on
comparing
the
first
autumn
month
provision
bill
with
that
of
the
last
spring
month
and
trying
to
account
for
the
difference
the
silence
broken
by
the
rattling
of
the
two
bills
in
her
hands
as
she
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
through
her
glasses
seemed
suddenly
impenetrable
and
the
prismatic
world
of
the
girl
rapture
burst
like
a
bubble
against
it
there
is
no
explanation
of
the
effect
outside
of
temperament
and
overwrought
sensibilities
she
stared
across
the
room
at
her
mother
who
had
not
heard
her
and
then
she
broke
into
a
storm
of
tears
alice
cried
her
mother
with
that
sanative
anger
which
comes
to
rescue
women
from
the
terror
of
any
sudden
shock
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
do
you
mean
she
dropped
both
of
the
provision
bills
to
the
floor
and
started
toward
her
daughter
nothing
nothing
let
me
go
i
want
to
go
to
my
she
tried
to
reach
the
door
beyond
her
mother
indeed
you
shall
not
cried
pasmer
i
will
not
have
you
behaving
so
what
has
happened
to
you
tell
me
you
have
frightened
me
half
out
of
my
the
girl
gave
up
her
efforts
to
escape
and
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
in
the
pillow
where
she
continued
to
sob
her
mother
began
to
relent
at
the
sight
of
her
passion
as
a
woman
and
as
a
mother
she
knew
her
daughter
and
she
knew
that
this
passion
whatever
it
was
must
have
vent
before
there
could
be
anything
intelligible
between
them
she
did
not
press
her
with
further
question
but
set
about
making
her
a
little
more
comfortable
on
the
sofa
she
pulled
the
pillow
straight
and
dropped
a
light
shawl
over
the
girl
shoulders
so
that
she
should
not
take
cold
then
pasmer
had
made
up
her
mind
that
alice
had
met
mavering
somewhere
and
that
this
outburst
was
the
retarded
effect
of
seeing
him
during
the
last
six
weeks
she
had
assisted
at
many
phases
of
feeling
in
regard
to
him
and
knew
more
clearly
than
alice
herself
the
meaning
of
them
all
she
had
been
patient
and
kind
with
the
resources
that
every
woman
finds
in
herself
when
it
is
the
question
of
a
daughter
ordeal
in
an
affair
of
the
heart
which
she
has
favoured
the
storm
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
alice
sat
upright
casting
off
the
wraps
but
once
checked
with
the
fact
on
her
tongue
she
found
it
hard
to
utter
it
what
is
it
alice
what
is
it
urged
her
mother
nothing
i
mavering
we
met
i
met
him
at
the
museum
and
engaged
it
really
so
it
seems
like
raving
but
it
true
he
came
with
me
to
the
door
i
would
let
him
come
in
do
you
believe
it
oh
we
are
indeed
we
are
are
you
glad
mamma
you
know
i
could
have
lived
without
she
trembled
on
the
verge
of
another
outbreak
pasmer
sacrificed
her
astonishment
in
the
interest
of
sanity
and
returned
quietly
glad
alice
you
know
that
i
think
he
the
sweetest
and
best
fellow
in
the
o
mamma
but
are
you
sure
yes
yes
i
not
crazy
it
is
a
dream
he
was
there
and
i
met
him
i
could
run
away
i
put
out
my
hand
i
could
help
it
i
thought
i
should
give
way
and
he
took
it
and
then
then
we
were
engaged
i
do
know
what
we
said
i
went
in
to
look
at
the
of
arc
again
and
there
was
no
one
else
there
he
seemed
to
feel
just
as
i
did
i
do
know
whether
either
of
us
spoke
but
we
knew
we
were
engaged
and
we
began
to
pasmer
began
to
laugh
to
her
irreverent
soul
only
the
droll
side
of
the
statement
appeared
do
mamma
pleaded
alice
piteously
no
no
i
wo
but
i
hope
dan
mavering
will
be
a
little
more
definite
about
it
when
i
allowed
to
see
him
why
could
he
have
come
in
with
you
it
would
have
killed
me
i
could
let
him
see
me
cry
and
i
knew
i
should
break
he
have
to
see
you
cry
a
great
many
times
alice
said
her
mother
with
almost
unexampled
seriousness
yes
but
not
yet
not
so
soon
he
must
think
i
very
gloomy
and
i
want
to
be
always
bright
and
cheerful
with
him
he
knows
why
i
let
him
come
in
he
knew
i
was
going
to
have
a
pasmer
continued
to
laugh
do
mamma
pleaded
alice
no
i
wo
replied
her
mother
as
before
i
suppose
he
was
mystified
but
now
if
it
really
settled
between
you
he
be
coming
here
soon
to
see
your
papa
and
yes
well
it
very
sudden
said
pasmer
though
i
suppose
these
things
always
seem
is
it
too
sudden
asked
alice
with
misgiving
it
seemed
so
to
me
when
it
was
going
on
but
i
could
stop
her
mother
laughed
at
her
simplicity
no
when
it
begins
once
nothing
can
stop
it
but
you
really
known
each
other
a
good
while
and
for
the
last
six
weeks
at
least
you
known
you
own
mind
about
him
pretty
clearly
it
a
pity
you
could
have
known
it
yes
that
what
he
says
he
says
it
was
such
a
waste
of
time
oh
everything
he
says
is
perfectly
fascinating
her
mother
laughed
and
laughed
again
what
is
it
mamma
are
you
laughing
at
me
oh
no
what
an
idea
he
could
seem
to
understand
why
i
did
say
yes
the
first
time
if
i
meant
she
looked
down
dreamily
at
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
then
she
said
with
a
blush
and
a
start
they
very
queer
do
you
think
who
young
oh
yes
alice
went
on
musingly
their
minds
are
so
different
everything
they
say
and
do
is
so
unexpected
and
yet
it
seems
to
be
just
pasmer
asked
herself
if
this
was
to
go
on
for
ever
but
she
had
not
the
heart
to
treat
it
with
her
natural
levity
probably
it
was
what
charmed
mavering
with
the
child
pasmer
had
the
firm
belief
that
mavering
was
not
and
she
respected
him
for
it
she
would
not
spoil
her
daughter
perfect
trust
and
hope
by
any
of
the
cynical
suggestions
of
her
own
dark
wisdom
but
entered
into
her
mood
as
such
women
are
able
to
do
and
flattered
out
of
her
every
detail
of
the
morning
history
this
was
a
feat
which
pasmer
enjoyed
for
its
own
sake
and
it
fully
satisfied
the
curiosity
which
she
naturally
felt
to
know
all
she
did
not
comment
upon
many
of
the
particulars
she
opened
her
eyes
a
little
at
the
notion
of
her
daughter
sitting
for
two
or
three
hours
and
talking
with
a
young
man
in
the
galleries
of
the
museum
and
she
asked
if
anybody
they
knew
had
come
in
when
she
heard
that
there
were
only
strangers
and
very
few
of
them
she
said
nothing
and
she
had
the
same
consolation
in
regard
to
the
walking
back
and
forth
in
the
garden
she
was
so
full
of
potential
escapades
herself
so
apt
to
let
herself
go
at
times
that
the
fact
of
innocent
rather
satisfied
a
need
of
her
nature
she
exulted
in
it
when
she
learned
that
there
were
only
nurses
and
children
in
the
garden
and
so
you
think
you
wo
take
up
art
this
winter
she
said
when
in
the
process
of
her
alice
had
left
the
sofa
and
got
as
far
as
the
door
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
and
her
sacque
on
her
arm
and
the
sisters
of
james
you
wo
join
them
either
the
girl
escaped
from
the
room
alice
alice
her
mother
called
after
her
she
came
back
you
told
me
how
he
happened
to
be
oh
that
was
the
most
amusing
part
of
it
he
had
gone
there
to
keep
an
appointment
with
two
ladies
from
portland
they
were
to
take
him
up
in
their
carriage
and
drive
out
to
cambridge
and
when
he
saw
me
he
forgot
all
about
and
what
became
of
them
we
do
know
is
it
ridiculous
if
it
appeared
other
or
more
than
this
to
pasmer
she
did
not
say
she
merely
said
after
a
moment
well
it
was
certainly
devoted
alice
and
let
her
go
xxvi
mavering
came
in
the
evening
rather
excessively
well
dressed
and
with
a
hot
face
and
cold
hands
while
he
waited
nominally
alone
in
the
little
drawing
room
for
pasmer
alice
flew
in
upon
him
for
a
swift
embrace
which
prolonged
itself
till
the
father
step
was
heard
outside
the
door
and
then
she
still
had
time
to
vanish
by
another
the
affair
was
so
nicely
adjusted
that
if
mavering
had
been
in
his
usual
mind
he
might
have
fancied
the
connivance
of
pasmer
he
did
not
say
what
he
had
meant
to
say
to
alice
father
but
it
seemed
to
serve
the
purpose
for
he
emerged
presently
from
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
unnaturally
clamorous
and
found
pasmer
saying
some
very
civil
things
to
him
about
his
character
and
disposition
so
far
as
they
had
been
able
to
observe
it
and
their
belief
and
trust
in
him
there
seemed
to
be
something
provisional
or
probational
intended
but
dan
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
and
finally
it
proved
of
no
practical
effect
he
merely
inferred
that
the
approval
of
his
family
was
respectfully
expected
and
he
hastened
to
say
oh
that
all
right
pasmer
went
on
with
more
civilities
and
lost
himself
in
dumb
conjecture
as
to
whether
mavering
father
had
been
in
the
class
before
him
or
the
class
after
him
in
harvard
he
used
his
black
eyebrows
a
good
deal
during
the
interview
and
mavering
conceived
an
awe
of
him
greater
than
he
had
felt
at
campobello
yet
not
unmixed
with
the
affection
in
which
the
newly
accepted
lover
embraces
even
the
relations
of
his
betrothed
from
time
to
time
pasmer
looked
about
with
the
vague
glance
of
a
man
unused
to
being
so
long
left
to
his
own
guidance
and
one
of
these
appeals
seemed
at
last
to
bring
pasmer
through
the
door
to
the
relief
of
both
the
men
for
they
had
improvidently
despatched
their
business
and
were
getting
out
of
talk
pasmer
had
in
fact
already
asked
dan
about
the
weather
outside
when
his
wife
appeared
dan
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
kiss
her
or
not
but
pasmer
did
not
in
the
abstract
seem
like
a
very
kissing
kind
of
person
and
he
let
himself
be
guided
by
this
impression
in
the
absence
of
any
fixed
principle
applying
to
the
case
she
made
some
neat
remark
concerning
the
probable
settlement
of
the
affair
with
her
husband
and
began
to
laugh
and
joke
about
it
in
a
manner
that
was
very
welcome
to
dan
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
so
solemnly
but
though
pasmer
laughed
and
joked
he
was
aware
of
her
meaning
business
business
in
the
nicest
sort
of
a
way
but
business
after
all
and
he
liked
her
for
it
he
was
glad
to
be
explicit
about
his
hopes
and
plans
and
told
what
his
circumstances
were
so
fully
that
pasmer
whom
his
frankness
gratified
and
amused
felt
obliged
to
say
that
she
had
not
meant
to
ask
so
much
about
his
affairs
and
he
must
excuse
her
if
she
had
seemed
to
do
so
she
had
her
own
belief
that
mavering
would
understand
but
she
did
not
mind
that
she
said
that
of
course
till
his
own
family
had
been
consulted
it
must
not
be
considered
seriously
that
pasmer
insisted
upon
that
point
and
when
dan
vehemently
asserted
the
acquiescence
of
his
family
beforehand
and
urged
his
father
admiration
for
alice
in
proof
she
reminded
him
that
his
mother
was
to
be
considered
and
put
pasmer
scruples
forward
as
her
own
reason
for
obduracy
in
her
husband
presence
she
attributed
to
him
with
his
silent
assent
all
sorts
of
reluctances
and
delicate
compunctions
she
gave
him
the
importance
which
would
have
been
naturally
a
husband
due
in
such
an
affair
and
ingratiated
herself
more
and
more
with
the
young
man
she
ignored
pasmer
withdrawal
when
it
took
place
after
a
certain
lapse
of
time
and
as
the
moment
had
come
for
that
she
began
to
let
herself
go
she
especially
approved
of
the
idea
of
going
abroad
and
confessed
her
disappointment
with
her
present
experiment
of
america
where
it
appeared
there
was
no
leisure
class
of
men
sufficiently
large
to
satisfy
the
social
needs
of
pasmer
nature
and
she
told
dan
that
he
might
expect
them
in
europe
before
long
perhaps
they
might
all
three
meet
him
there
at
this
he
betrayed
so
clearly
that
he
now
intended
his
going
to
europe
merely
as
a
sequel
to
his
marrying
alice
while
he
affected
to
fall
in
with
all
pasmer
said
that
she
grew
fonder
than
ever
of
him
for
his
ardour
and
his
futile
duplicity
if
it
had
been
in
dan
mind
to
take
part
in
the
rite
pasmer
was
quite
ready
at
this
point
to
embrace
him
with
motherly
tenderness
her
tough
little
heart
was
really
in
her
throat
with
sympathy
when
she
made
an
errand
for
the
photograph
of
an
english
vicarage
which
they
had
hired
the
summer
of
the
year
before
and
she
sent
alice
back
with
it
alone
it
seemed
so
long
since
they
had
met
that
the
change
in
alice
did
not
strike
him
as
strange
or
as
too
rapidly
operated
they
met
with
the
fervour
natural
after
such
a
separation
and
she
did
not
so
much
assume
as
resume
possession
of
him
it
was
charming
to
have
her
do
it
to
have
her
act
as
if
they
had
always
been
engaged
to
have
her
try
to
press
down
the
cowlick
that
started
capriciously
across
his
crown
and
to
straighten
his
necktie
and
then
to
drop
beside
him
on
the
sofa
it
thrilled
and
awed
him
and
he
silently
worshipped
the
superior
composure
which
her
sex
has
in
such
matters
whatever
was
the
provisional
interpretation
which
her
father
and
mother
pretended
to
put
upon
the
affair
she
apparently
had
no
reservations
and
they
talked
of
their
future
as
a
thing
assured
the
dark
ages
as
they
agreed
to
call
the
period
of
despair
for
ever
closed
that
morning
had
matured
their
love
till
now
it
was
a
rapture
of
pure
trust
they
talked
as
if
nothing
could
prevent
its
fulfilment
and
they
did
not
even
affect
to
consider
the
question
of
his
family
liking
it
or
not
liking
it
she
said
that
she
thought
his
father
was
delightful
and
he
told
her
that
his
father
had
taken
the
greatest
fancy
to
her
at
the
beginning
and
knew
that
dan
was
in
love
with
her
she
asked
him
about
his
mother
and
she
said
just
what
he
could
have
wished
her
to
say
about
his
mother
sufferings
and
the
way
she
bore
them
they
talked
about
alice
going
to
see
her
of
course
your
father
will
bring
your
sisters
to
see
me
is
that
the
way
he
asked
you
may
depend
upon
his
doing
the
right
thing
whatever
it
well
that
the
right
thing
she
said
i
thought
it
out
and
that
reminds
me
of
a
duty
of
ours
dan
a
duty
he
repeated
with
a
note
of
reluctance
for
its
untimeliness
yes
ca
you
think
what
no
i
did
know
there
was
a
duty
left
in
the
it
full
of
oh
do
say
that
alice
he
did
not
like
this
mood
so
well
as
that
of
the
morning
but
his
dislike
was
only
a
vague
discomfort
nothing
formulated
or
distinct
yes
she
persisted
and
we
must
do
them
you
must
go
to
those
ladies
you
disappointed
so
this
morning
and
apologise
dan
laughed
why
it
was
such
a
very
ironclad
engagement
as
all
that
alice
they
said
they
were
going
to
drive
out
to
cambridge
over
the
milldam
and
i
said
i
was
going
out
there
to
get
some
of
my
traps
together
and
they
could
pick
me
up
at
the
art
museum
if
they
liked
besides
how
could
i
explain
she
laughed
consciously
with
him
of
course
but
she
added
ruefully
i
wish
you
had
disappointed
oh
they
get
over
it
if
i
had
disappointed
them
i
should
be
here
and
i
should
like
that
should
you
no
but
i
wish
it
had
happened
it
a
blot
and
i
did
want
a
blot
on
this
oh
well
it
is
very
much
of
a
blot
and
i
can
easily
wipe
it
off
i
tell
you
what
alice
i
can
write
to
frobisher
when
our
engagement
comes
out
and
tell
her
how
it
was
she
enjoy
the
joke
and
so
will
miss
wrayne
they
jolly
and
easygoing
they
wo
how
long
have
you
known
them
i
met
them
on
class
day
and
then
i
saw
them
the
day
after
i
left
dan
laughed
a
little
how
saw
them
well
i
went
to
a
yacht
race
with
them
i
happened
to
meet
them
in
the
street
and
they
wanted
me
to
go
and
i
was
all
broken
up
and
i
oh
said
alice
the
day
after
i
you
left
campobello
well
and
i
was
thinking
of
you
all
that
day
as
and
i
could
bear
to
look
at
anybody
that
day
or
speak
well
the
fact
is
i
i
was
distracted
and
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
i
was
desperate
i
did
how
did
you
find
out
about
the
yacht
race
boardman
told
me
boardman
was
did
he
know
the
ladies
did
he
go
too
no
he
was
there
to
report
the
race
for
the
events
he
went
on
the
press
oh
said
alice
was
there
a
large
party
no
no
not
very
just
ourselves
in
fact
they
were
awfully
kind
and
they
made
me
go
home
to
dinner
with
they
must
have
been
rather
peculiar
people
said
alice
and
i
see
how
so
soon
she
could
not
realise
that
mavering
was
then
a
rejected
man
on
whom
she
had
voluntarily
renounced
all
claim
a
retroactive
resentment
which
she
could
not
control
possessed
her
with
the
wish
to
punish
those
bold
women
for
being
agreeable
to
one
who
had
since
become
everything
to
her
though
then
he
was
ostensibly
nothing
in
a
vague
way
dan
felt
her
displeasure
with
that
passage
of
his
history
but
no
man
could
have
fully
imagined
it
i
could
tell
half
the
time
what
i
was
saying
or
eating
i
talked
at
random
and
ate
at
random
i
guess
they
thought
something
was
wrong
they
asked
me
who
was
at
indeed
but
you
may
be
sure
i
did
give
myself
away
i
was
awfully
broken
up
he
concluded
inconsequently
she
liked
his
being
broken
up
but
she
did
not
like
the
rest
she
would
not
press
the
question
further
now
she
only
said
rather
gravely
if
it
such
a
short
acquaintance
can
you
write
to
them
in
that
familiar
way
oh
yes
frobisher
is
one
of
that
alice
was
silent
a
moment
before
she
said
i
think
you
better
not
write
let
it
go
she
sighed
yes
that
what
i
think
said
dan
better
let
it
go
i
guess
it
will
explain
itself
in
the
course
of
time
but
i
do
want
any
blots
he
leaned
over
and
looked
her
smilingly
in
the
face
oh
no
she
murmured
and
then
suddenly
she
caught
him
round
the
neck
crying
and
sobbing
it
only
because
i
wanted
it
to
be
perfect
oh
i
wonder
if
i
done
right
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
taken
you
after
all
but
i
do
love
you
dearly
dearly
and
i
was
so
unhappy
when
lost
you
and
now
i
afraid
i
shall
be
a
trial
to
you
nothing
but
a
the
first
tears
that
a
young
man
sees
a
woman
shed
for
love
of
him
are
inexpressibly
sweeter
than
her
smiles
dan
choked
with
tender
pride
and
pity
when
he
found
his
voice
he
raved
out
with
incoherent
endearments
that
she
only
made
him
more
and
more
happy
by
her
wish
to
have
the
affair
perfect
and
that
he
wished
her
always
to
be
exacting
with
him
for
that
would
give
him
a
chance
to
do
something
for
her
and
all
that
he
desired
as
long
as
he
lived
was
to
do
just
what
she
wished
at
the
end
of
his
vows
and
entreaties
she
lifted
her
face
radiantly
and
bent
a
smile
upon
him
as
sunny
as
that
with
which
the
sky
after
a
summer
storm
denies
that
there
has
ever
been
rain
in
the
world
ah
you
he
could
say
no
more
he
could
not
be
more
enraptured
than
he
was
he
could
only
pass
from
surprise
to
surprise
from
delight
to
delight
it
was
her
love
of
him
which
wrought
these
miracles
it
was
all
a
miracle
and
no
part
more
wonderful
than
another
that
she
who
had
seemed
as
distant
as
a
star
and
divinely
sacred
from
human
touch
should
be
there
in
his
arms
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
where
his
kiss
could
reach
her
lips
not
only
unforbidden
but
eagerly
welcome
was
impossible
and
yet
it
was
but
it
was
no
more
impossible
and
no
truer
than
that
a
being
so
poised
so
perfectly
as
she
should
already
be
so
helplessly
dependent
upon
him
for
her
happiness
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
invoked
awful
penalties
upon
himself
if
ever
he
should
betray
her
trust
if
ever
he
should
grieve
that
tender
heart
in
the
slightest
thing
if
from
that
moment
he
did
not
make
his
whole
life
a
sacrifice
and
an
expiation
he
uttered
some
of
these
exalted
thoughts
and
they
did
not
seem
to
appear
crazy
to
her
she
said
yes
they
must
make
their
separate
lives
offerings
to
each
other
and
their
joint
lives
an
offering
to
god
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
at
these
words
of
hers
they
were
so
beautiful
and
holy
and
wise
he
agreed
that
one
ought
always
to
go
to
church
and
that
now
he
should
never
miss
a
service
he
owned
that
he
had
been
culpable
in
the
past
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
if
that
were
possible
and
sealed
his
words
with
a
kiss
but
he
could
not
realise
his
happiness
then
or
afterward
when
he
walked
the
streets
under
the
thinly
misted
moon
of
that
indian
summer
night
he
went
down
to
the
events
office
when
he
left
alice
and
found
boardman
and
told
him
that
he
was
engaged
and
tried
to
work
boardman
up
to
some
sense
of
the
greatness
of
the
fact
boardman
shoved
his
fine
white
teeth
under
his
spare
moustache
and
made
acceptable
jokes
but
he
did
not
ask
indiscreet
questions
and
dan
statement
of
the
fact
did
not
seem
to
give
it
any
more
verity
than
it
had
before
he
tried
to
get
boardman
to
come
and
walk
with
him
and
talk
it
over
but
boardman
said
he
had
just
been
detailed
to
go
and
work
up
the
case
of
a
chinaman
who
had
suicided
a
little
earlier
in
the
evening
very
well
then
i
go
with
you
said
mavering
how
can
you
live
in
such
a
den
as
this
he
asked
looking
about
the
little
room
before
boardman
turned
down
his
incandescent
electric
there
is
anything
big
enough
to
hold
me
but
all
in
the
street
he
linked
his
arm
through
his
friend
and
said
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
know
all
about
the
happy
ending
of
the
affair
since
he
had
been
told
of
that
miserable
phase
of
it
at
portland
but
when
he
came
to
the
facts
he
found
himself
unable
to
give
them
with
the
fulness
he
had
promised
he
only
imparted
a
succinct
statement
as
to
the
where
and
when
of
the
whole
matter
leaving
the
how
of
it
untold
the
sketch
was
apparently
enough
for
boardman
for
all
comment
he
reminded
mavering
that
he
had
told
him
at
portland
it
would
come
out
all
right
yes
you
did
boardman
that
a
fact
said
dan
and
he
conceived
a
higher
respect
for
the
penetration
of
boardman
than
he
had
before
they
stopped
at
a
door
in
a
poor
court
which
they
had
somehow
reached
without
mavering
privity
will
you
come
in
asked
boardman
what
for
chinaman
then
mavering
remembered
good
heavens
no
what
have
i
got
to
do
with
him
both
mortal
suggested
the
reporter
the
absurdity
of
this
idea
though
a
little
grisly
struck
dan
as
a
good
joke
he
hit
the
companionable
boardman
on
the
shoulder
and
then
gave
him
a
little
hug
and
remounted
his
path
of
air
and
walked
off
in
it
xxvii
mavering
first
woke
in
the
morning
with
the
mechanical
recurrence
of
that
shame
and
grief
which
each
day
had
brought
him
since
alice
refused
him
then
with
a
leap
of
the
heart
came
the
recollection
of
all
that
had
happened
yesterday
yet
lurking
within
his
rapture
was
a
mystery
of
regret
a
reasonless
sense
of
loss
as
if
the
old
feeling
had
been
something
he
would
have
kept
then
this
faded
and
he
had
only
the
longing
to
see
her
to
realise
in
her
presence
and
with
her
help
the
fact
that
she
was
his
an
unspeakable
pride
filled
him
and
a
joy
in
her
love
he
tried
to
see
some
outward
vision
of
his
bliss
in
the
glass
but
like
the
mirror
which
had
refused
to
interpret
his
tragedy
in
the
portland
restaurant
it
gave
back
no
image
of
his
transport
his
face
looked
as
it
always
did
and
he
and
the
refection
laughed
at
each
other
he
asked
himself
how
soon
he
could
go
and
see
her
it
was
now
seven
eight
would
be
too
early
of
course
it
would
be
ridiculous
and
nine
he
wondered
if
he
might
go
to
see
her
at
nine
would
they
have
done
breakfast
had
he
any
right
to
call
before
ten
he
was
miserable
at
the
thought
of
waiting
till
ten
it
would
be
three
hours
he
thought
of
pretexts
of
inviting
her
to
go
somewhere
but
that
was
absurd
for
he
could
see
her
at
home
all
day
if
he
liked
of
carrying
her
a
book
but
there
could
be
no
such
haste
about
a
book
of
going
to
ask
if
he
had
left
his
cane
but
why
should
he
be
in
such
a
hurry
for
his
cane
all
at
once
he
thought
he
could
take
her
some
flowers
a
bouquet
to
lay
beside
her
plate
at
breakfast
he
dramatised
himself
charging
the
servant
who
should
take
it
from
him
at
the
door
not
to
say
who
left
it
but
alice
would
know
of
course
and
they
would
all
know
it
would
be
very
pretty
he
made
pasmer
say
some
flattering
things
of
him
and
he
made
alice
blush
deliciously
to
hear
them
he
could
not
manage
pasmer
very
well
and
he
left
him
out
of
the
scene
he
imagined
him
shaving
in
another
room
then
he
remembered
his
wearing
a
full
beard
he
dressed
himself
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
went
down
into
the
hotel
vestibule
where
he
had
noticed
people
selling
flowers
the
evening
before
but
there
was
no
one
there
with
them
now
and
none
of
the
florists
shops
on
the
street
were
open
yet
he
could
not
find
anything
till
he
went
to
the
providence
depot
and
the
man
there
had
to
take
some
of
his
yesterday
flowers
out
of
the
refrigerator
where
he
kept
them
he
was
not
sure
they
would
be
very
fresh
but
the
heavy
rosebuds
had
fallen
open
and
they
were
superb
dan
took
all
there
were
and
when
they
had
been
sprinkled
with
water
and
wrapped
in
cotton
batting
and
tied
round
with
paper
it
was
still
only
quarter
of
eight
and
he
left
them
with
the
man
till
he
could
get
his
breakfast
at
the
depot
restaurant
there
it
had
a
consoling
effect
of
not
being
so
early
many
people
were
already
breakfasting
and
when
dan
said
with
his
order
hurry
it
up
please
he
knew
that
he
was
taken
for
a
passenger
just
arrived
or
departing
by
a
fantastic
impulse
he
ordered
eggs
and
bacon
again
he
felt
it
a
fine
derision
of
the
past
and
a
seal
of
triumph
upon
the
present
to
have
the
same
breakfast
after
his
acceptance
as
he
had
ordered
after
his
rejection
he
would
tell
alice
about
it
and
it
would
amuse
her
he
imagined
how
he
would
say
it
and
she
would
laugh
but
she
would
be
full
of
a
ravishing
compassion
for
his
past
suffering
they
were
long
bringing
the
breakfast
when
it
came
he
despatched
it
so
quickly
that
it
was
only
half
after
eight
when
he
paid
his
check
at
the
counter
he
tried
to
be
five
minutes
more
getting
his
flowers
but
the
man
had
them
all
ready
for
him
and
it
did
not
take
him
ten
seconds
he
had
said
he
would
carry
them
at
nine
but
thinking
it
over
on
a
bench
in
the
garden
he
decided
that
he
had
better
go
sooner
they
might
breakfast
earlier
and
there
would
be
no
fun
if
alice
did
not
find
the
roses
beside
her
plate
that
was
the
whole
idea
it
was
not
till
he
stood
at
the
door
of
the
pasmer
apartment
that
he
reflected
that
he
was
not
accomplishing
his
wish
to
see
alice
by
leaving
her
those
flowers
he
was
a
fool
for
now
he
would
have
to
postpone
coming
a
little
because
he
had
already
come
the
girl
who
answered
the
bell
did
not
understand
the
charge
he
gave
her
about
the
roses
and
he
repeated
his
words
some
one
passing
through
the
room
beyond
seemed
to
hesitate
and
pause
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
could
it
be
alice
then
he
should
see
her
after
all
the
girl
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
said
mrs
pasmer
came
forward
and
he
fell
into
a
complicated
explanation
and
apology
at
the
end
she
said
you
had
better
give
them
yourself
she
will
be
here
they
were
in
the
room
now
and
pasmer
made
the
time
pass
in
rapid
talk
but
dan
felt
that
he
ought
to
apologise
from
time
to
time
no
she
said
letting
herself
go
stay
and
breakfast
with
us
mavering
we
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
at
last
alice
came
in
and
they
decorously
shook
hands
pasmer
turned
away
a
smile
at
their
decorum
i
will
see
that
there
a
place
for
you
she
said
leaving
them
they
were
instantly
in
each
other
arms
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
this
had
happened
because
he
had
so
strongly
wished
it
what
is
it
dan
what
did
you
come
for
she
asked
to
see
if
it
was
really
true
alice
i
could
believe
well
let
me
go
you
must
it
too
silly
of
course
it
she
pulled
herself
free
is
my
hair
tumbled
you
ought
to
have
come
it
ridiculous
but
i
glad
you
came
i
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
i
got
a
great
many
things
to
say
to
you
but
come
to
breakfast
she
had
a
way
of
treating
the
situation
that
was
more
intoxicating
than
sentiment
would
have
been
and
gave
it
more
actuality
pasmer
was
alone
at
the
table
and
explained
that
alice
father
never
breakfasted
with
them
or
very
seldom
where
are
your
flowers
she
asked
alice
flowers
what
flowers
that
mavering
they
all
looked
at
one
another
dan
ran
out
and
brought
in
his
roses
they
were
trying
to
get
away
in
the
excitement
i
guess
pasmer
i
found
them
behind
the
he
had
flung
them
there
without
knowing
it
when
pasmer
left
him
with
alice
he
expected
her
to
join
him
and
her
mother
in
being
amused
at
this
but
he
was
as
well
pleased
to
have
her
touched
at
his
having
brought
them
and
to
turn
their
gaiety
off
in
praise
of
the
roses
she
got
a
vase
for
them
and
set
it
on
the
table
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
pretty
she
had
on
with
its
barred
corsage
and
and
the
heavy
silken
rope
knotted
round
it
at
the
waist
and
dropping
in
heavy
tufts
or
balls
in
front
the
breakfast
was
continental
in
its
simplicity
and
pasmer
said
that
they
had
always
kept
up
their
paris
habit
of
a
light
breakfast
even
in
london
where
it
was
not
so
easy
to
follow
foreign
customs
as
it
was
in
america
she
was
afraid
he
might
find
it
too
light
then
he
told
all
about
his
morning
adventure
ending
with
his
breakfast
at
the
providence
depot
pasmer
entered
into
the
fun
of
it
but
she
said
it
was
for
only
once
in
a
way
and
he
must
not
expect
to
be
let
in
if
he
came
at
that
hour
another
morning
he
said
no
he
understood
what
an
extraordinary
piece
of
luck
it
was
for
him
to
be
there
and
he
was
there
to
be
bidden
to
do
whatever
they
wished
he
said
so
much
in
recognition
of
their
goodness
that
he
became
abashed
by
it
pasmer
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
alice
across
it
from
him
so
far
off
that
she
seemed
parted
from
him
by
an
insuperable
moral
distance
a
warm
flush
seemed
to
rise
from
his
heart
into
his
throat
and
stifle
him
he
wished
to
shed
tears
his
eyes
were
wet
with
grateful
happiness
in
answering
pasmer
that
he
would
not
have
any
more
coffee
then
she
said
we
will
go
into
the
but
she
allowed
him
and
alice
to
go
alone
he
was
still
in
that
illusion
of
awe
and
of
distance
and
he
submitted
to
the
interposition
of
another
table
between
their
chairs
i
wish
to
talk
with
you
she
said
so
seriously
that
he
was
frightened
and
said
to
himself
now
she
is
going
to
break
it
off
she
has
thought
it
over
and
she
finds
she
ca
endure
well
he
said
huskily
you
ought
to
have
come
here
you
know
this
i
know
it
he
vaguely
conceded
but
i
did
expect
to
get
well
now
you
here
we
may
as
well
talk
you
must
tell
your
family
at
yes
i
going
to
write
to
them
as
soon
as
i
get
back
to
my
room
i
could
last
but
you
must
write
you
must
go
and
prepare
their
go
he
echoed
oh
that
is
necessary
my
father
knew
about
it
from
the
beginning
and
i
guess
they
all
talked
it
over
their
minds
are
the
sense
of
his
immeasurable
superiority
to
any
opposition
began
to
dissipate
dan
unnatural
awe
at
the
pleading
face
which
alice
put
on
resting
one
cheek
against
the
back
of
one
of
her
clasped
hands
and
leaning
on
the
table
with
her
elbows
he
began
to
be
teased
by
that
silken
rope
round
her
waist
but
you
do
understand
dear
she
said
and
she
said
dear
as
if
they
were
old
married
people
you
must
go
to
see
them
and
tell
them
and
then
some
of
them
must
come
to
see
me
your
father
and
why
of
his
eye
now
became
fastened
to
one
of
the
fluffy
silken
balls
and
then
mamma
and
i
must
go
to
see
your
mother
must
we
it
be
very
nice
of
you
yes
you
know
she
ca
come
to
yes
that
what
i
thought
and
what
are
you
looking
at
she
drew
herself
back
from
the
table
and
followed
the
direction
of
his
eye
with
a
woman
instinctive
apprehension
of
disarray
he
was
ashamed
to
tell
oh
nothing
i
was
just
what
well
i
do
know
that
it
seems
so
strange
any
one
else
should
have
any
to
do
with
it
my
family
and
yours
but
i
suppose
they
must
yes
it
all
why
of
course
if
your
family
did
like
it
it
would
make
any
difference
to
me
said
dan
resolutely
it
would
to
me
she
retorted
with
tender
reproach
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
pleasant
to
go
into
a
family
that
did
like
you
suppose
papa
and
mamma
did
like
you
but
i
thought
they
did
said
mavering
with
his
mind
still
partly
on
the
rope
and
the
fluffy
ball
but
keeping
his
eyes
away
yes
they
do
said
alice
but
your
family
do
know
me
at
all
and
your
father
only
seen
me
once
ca
you
understand
i
afraid
we
do
look
at
it
seriously
enough
earnestly
and
oh
i
do
wish
to
have
everything
done
as
it
should
be
sometimes
when
i
think
of
it
it
makes
me
tremble
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
morning
and
and
dan
wanted
to
fall
on
his
knees
to
her
the
idea
of
alice
in
prayer
was
fascinating
i
wish
our
life
to
begin
with
others
and
not
with
ourselves
if
intrusted
with
so
much
happiness
does
it
mean
that
we
to
do
good
with
it
to
give
it
to
others
as
if
it
were
money
the
nobleness
of
this
thought
stirred
dan
greatly
his
eyes
wandered
back
to
the
silken
rope
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
an
emblem
of
voluntary
suffering
and
like
a
devotee
hempen
girdle
he
perceived
that
the
love
of
this
angelic
girl
would
elevate
him
and
hallow
his
whole
life
if
he
would
let
it
he
answered
her
fervently
that
he
would
be
guided
by
her
in
this
as
in
everything
that
he
knew
he
was
selfish
and
he
was
afraid
he
was
not
very
good
but
it
was
not
because
he
had
not
wished
to
be
so
it
was
because
he
had
not
had
any
incentive
he
thought
how
much
nobler
and
better
this
was
than
the
talk
he
had
usually
had
with
girls
he
said
that
of
course
he
would
go
home
and
tell
his
people
he
saw
now
that
it
would
make
them
happier
if
they
could
hear
it
directly
from
him
he
had
only
thought
of
writing
because
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
letting
a
day
pass
without
seeing
her
but
if
he
took
the
early
morning
train
he
could
get
back
the
same
night
and
still
have
three
hours
at
ponkwasset
falls
and
he
would
go
the
next
day
if
she
said
so
go
dan
she
said
and
she
stretched
out
her
hand
impressively
across
the
table
toward
him
he
seized
it
with
a
gush
of
tenderness
and
they
drew
together
in
their
resolution
to
live
for
others
he
said
he
would
go
at
once
but
the
next
train
did
not
leave
till
two
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
in
the
accomplishment
of
their
high
aims
that
they
sat
down
on
the
sofa
together
and
talked
of
their
future
alice
conditioned
it
wholly
upon
his
people
approval
of
her
which
seemed
wildly
unnecessary
to
mavering
and
amused
him
immensely
yes
she
said
i
know
you
will
think
me
strange
in
a
great
many
things
but
i
shall
never
keep
anything
from
you
and
i
going
to
tell
you
that
i
went
to
matins
this
to
matins
echoed
dan
he
would
not
quite
have
liked
her
a
catholic
he
remembered
with
relief
that
she
had
said
she
was
not
a
roman
catholic
though
when
he
came
to
think
he
would
not
have
cared
a
great
deal
nothing
could
have
changed
her
from
being
alice
yes
i
wished
to
consecrate
the
first
morning
of
our
engagement
and
i
always
going
i
determined
that
i
would
go
before
breakfast
that
was
what
made
breakfast
so
late
do
you
like
it
she
asked
timidly
like
it
he
said
i
going
with
you
oh
no
she
turned
upon
him
that
would
she
became
grave
again
i
glad
you
approve
of
it
for
i
should
feel
that
there
was
something
wanting
to
our
happiness
if
marriage
is
a
sacrament
why
should
an
engagement
be
it
is
said
dan
and
he
felt
that
it
was
holy
till
then
he
had
never
realised
that
marriage
was
a
sacrament
though
he
had
often
heard
the
phrase
at
the
end
of
an
hour
they
took
a
tender
leave
of
each
other
hastened
by
the
sound
of
pasmer
voice
without
alice
escaped
from
one
door
before
her
mother
entered
by
the
other
dan
remained
trying
to
look
unconcerned
but
he
was
sensible
of
succeeding
so
poorly
that
he
thought
he
had
better
offer
his
hand
to
pasmer
at
once
he
told
her
that
he
was
going
up
to
ponkwasset
falls
at
two
and
asked
her
to
please
remember
him
to
pasmer
she
said
she
would
and
asked
him
if
he
were
to
be
gone
long
oh
no
just
overnight
till
i
can
tell
them
what
he
felt
it
a
comfort
to
be
trivial
with
pasmer
after
bracing
up
to
ideals
i
suppose
they
have
to
what
an
exemplary
son
said
pasmer
yes
i
suppose
they
i
supposed
it
would
be
enough
if
i
wrote
but
alice
thinks
i
better
report
in
i
think
you
had
indeed
and
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
you
both
to
have
the
time
for
clarifying
your
ideas
did
she
tell
you
she
had
been
at
matins
this
morning
a
light
of
laughter
trembled
in
eyes
and
mavering
could
not
keep
a
responsive
gleam
out
of
his
own
in
an
instant
the
dedication
of
his
engagement
by
morning
prayer
ceased
to
be
a
high
and
solemn
thought
and
became
deliciously
amusing
and
this
laughing
alice
over
with
her
mother
did
more
to
realise
the
fact
that
she
was
his
than
anything
else
had
yet
done
in
that
dark
passage
outside
he
felt
two
arms
go
tenderly
round
his
neck
and
a
soft
shape
strain
itself
to
his
heart
i
know
you
have
been
laughing
about
me
but
you
may
i
yours
now
even
to
laugh
at
if
you
you
are
mine
to
fall
down
and
worship
he
vowed
with
an
instant
revulsion
of
feeling
alice
did
say
anything
he
felt
her
hand
fumbling
about
his
coat
lapel
where
is
your
breast
pocket
she
asked
and
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
which
left
a
something
in
his
it
is
very
good
she
murmured
as
well
as
she
could
with
her
lips
against
his
cheek
but
i
thought
you
like
to
show
them
some
proof
of
my
existence
i
shall
have
none
of
yours
while
you
o
alice
you
think
of
everything
his
heart
was
pierced
by
the
soft
reproach
implied
in
her
words
he
had
not
thought
to
ask
her
for
her
photograph
but
she
had
thought
to
give
it
she
must
have
felt
it
strange
that
he
had
not
asked
for
it
and
she
had
meant
to
slip
it
in
his
pocket
and
let
him
find
it
there
but
even
his
pang
of
was
a
part
of
his
transport
he
seemed
to
float
down
the
stairs
his
mind
was
in
a
delirious
whirl
i
shall
go
mad
he
said
to
himself
in
the
excess
of
his
joy
i
shall
die
xxviii
the
parting
scene
with
alice
persisted
in
mavering
thought
far
on
the
way
to
ponkwasset
falls
he
now
succeeded
in
saying
everything
to
her
how
deeply
he
felt
her
giving
him
her
photograph
to
cheer
him
in
his
separation
from
her
how
much
he
appreciated
her
forethought
in
providing
him
with
some
answer
when
his
mother
and
sisters
should
ask
him
about
her
looks
he
took
out
the
picture
and
pretended
to
the
other
passengers
to
be
looking
very
closely
at
it
and
so
managed
to
kiss
it
he
told
her
that
now
he
understood
what
love
really
was
how
powerful
how
it
did
conquer
everything
that
it
had
changed
him
and
made
him
already
a
better
man
he
made
her
refuse
all
merit
in
the
work
when
he
began
to
formulate
the
facts
for
communication
to
his
family
love
did
not
seem
so
potent
he
found
himself
ashamed
of
his
passion
or
at
least
unwilling
to
let
it
be
its
own
excuse
even
he
had
a
wish
to
give
it
almost
any
other
appearance
until
he
came
in
sight
of
the
station
and
the
works
it
had
not
seemed
possible
for
any
one
to
object
to
alice
he
had
been
going
home
as
a
matter
of
form
to
receive
the
adhesion
of
his
family
but
now
he
was
forced
to
see
that
she
might
be
considered
critically
even
reluctantly
this
would
only
be
because
his
family
did
not
understand
how
perfect
alice
was
but
they
might
not
understand
with
his
father
there
would
be
no
difficulty
his
father
had
seen
alice
and
admired
her
he
would
be
all
right
dan
found
himself
hoping
this
rather
anxiously
as
if
from
the
instinctive
need
of
his
support
with
his
mother
and
sisters
he
stopped
at
the
works
when
he
left
the
train
and
found
his
father
in
his
private
office
beyond
the
which
he
penetrated
with
a
nod
to
the
accountant
hello
dan
said
his
father
looking
up
and
hello
father
said
dan
being
alone
the
father
and
son
not
only
shook
hands
but
kissed
each
other
as
they
used
to
do
in
meeting
after
an
absence
when
dan
was
younger
he
had
closed
his
father
door
with
his
left
hand
in
giving
his
right
and
now
he
said
at
once
father
i
come
home
to
tell
you
that
engaged
to
be
dan
had
prearranged
his
father
behaviour
at
this
announcement
but
he
now
perceived
that
he
would
have
to
modify
the
scene
if
it
were
to
represent
the
facts
his
father
did
not
brighten
all
over
and
demand
miss
pasmer
of
course
he
contrived
to
hide
whatever
start
the
news
had
given
him
and
was
some
time
in
asking
with
his
soft
lisp
that
rather
sudden
dan
well
not
for
me
said
dan
laughing
uneasily
it
you
know
her
father
miss
oh
yes
said
his
father
certainly
not
with
displeasure
and
yet
not
with
enthusiasm
i
had
ever
since
class
day
to
think
it
over
and
it
came
to
a
climax
and
then
you
stopped
thinking
said
his
father
to
gain
time
it
appeared
to
dan
yes
sir
said
dan
i
have
thought
well
said
his
father
with
an
amusement
which
was
not
unfriendly
he
added
after
a
moment
but
i
thought
that
had
been
broken
off
and
dan
instinct
penetrated
to
the
lurking
fact
that
his
father
must
have
talked
the
rupture
over
with
his
mother
and
not
wholly
regretted
it
there
was
a
kind
of
hitch
at
one
time
he
admitted
but
it
all
right
well
well
said
his
father
this
is
great
news
great
news
and
he
seemed
to
be
shaping
himself
to
the
new
posture
of
affairs
while
giving
it
a
conditional
recognition
she
a
beautiful
is
she
cried
dan
with
a
little
break
in
his
voice
for
he
had
found
his
father
manner
rather
trying
and
she
good
too
i
assure
you
that
she
is
she
is
simply
perfect
every
well
said
the
elder
mavering
rising
and
pulling
down
the
rolling
top
of
his
desk
i
glad
to
hear
it
for
your
sake
dan
have
you
been
up
at
the
house
yet
no
i
just
off
the
how
is
her
mother
how
is
pasmer
all
well
yes
sir
said
dan
they
all
very
well
you
do
know
pasmer
i
believe
sir
do
you
not
since
college
what
sort
of
person
is
he
he
very
refined
and
quiet
very
handsome
very
courteous
very
nice
ah
that
good
said
elbridge
mavering
with
the
effect
of
not
having
been
very
attentive
to
his
son
answer
they
walked
up
the
long
slope
of
the
hillside
on
which
the
house
stood
overlooking
the
valley
where
the
works
were
and
fronting
the
plateau
across
the
river
where
the
village
of
operatives
houses
was
scattered
the
paling
light
of
what
had
been
a
very
red
sunset
flushed
them
and
brought
out
the
picturesqueness
which
the
architect
who
designed
them
for
a
particular
effect
in
the
view
from
the
owner
mansion
had
intended
a
good
carriage
road
followed
the
easiest
line
of
ascent
towards
this
edifice
and
reached
a
gateway
within
it
began
to
describe
a
curve
bordered
with
asphalted
footways
to
the
broad
verandah
of
the
house
and
then
descended
again
to
the
gate
the
grounds
enclosed
were
planted
with
deciduous
shrubs
which
had
now
mostly
dropped
their
leaves
and
clumps
of
firs
darkening
in
the
evening
light
with
the
gleam
of
some
garden
statues
shivering
about
the
lawn
next
the
house
the
breeze
grew
colder
and
stiffer
as
the
father
and
son
mounted
toward
the
mansion
which
dan
used
to
believe
was
like
a
chateau
with
its
and
dormer
windows
and
chimneys
it
now
blocked
its
space
sharply
out
of
the
thin
pink
of
the
western
sky
and
its
lights
sparkled
with
a
wintry
keenness
which
had
often
thrilled
dan
when
he
climbed
the
hill
from
the
station
in
former
homecomings
their
brilliancy
gave
him
a
strange
sinking
of
the
heart
for
no
reason
he
and
his
father
had
kept
up
a
sort
of
desultory
talk
about
alice
and
he
could
not
have
said
that
his
father
had
seemed
indifferent
he
had
touched
the
affair
only
too
acquiescently
it
was
painfully
like
everything
else
when
they
came
in
full
sight
of
the
house
dan
left
the
subject
as
he
realised
presently
from
a
reasonless
fear
of
being
overheard
it
seems
much
later
here
sir
than
it
does
in
boston
he
said
glancing
round
at
the
maples
which
stood
ragged
with
half
their
leaves
blown
from
them
yes
we
in
the
hills
and
we
further
north
answered
his
father
there
dan
had
seen
his
sister
on
the
verandah
pausing
at
sight
of
him
and
puzzled
to
make
out
who
was
with
her
father
he
had
an
impulse
to
hail
her
with
a
shout
but
he
could
not
in
his
last
walk
with
her
he
had
told
her
that
he
should
never
marry
and
they
had
planned
to
live
together
it
was
a
joke
but
now
he
felt
as
if
he
had
come
to
rob
her
of
something
and
he
walked
soberly
on
with
his
father
why
dan
you
fellow
she
called
out
when
he
came
near
enough
to
be
unmistakable
and
ran
down
the
steps
to
kiss
him
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
when
did
you
come
why
did
you
hollo
instead
of
letting
me
stand
here
guessing
you
not
sick
are
you
the
father
got
himself
indoors
unnoticed
in
the
excitement
of
the
brother
arrival
this
would
have
been
the
best
moment
for
dan
to
tell
his
sister
of
his
engagement
he
knew
it
but
he
parried
her
curiosity
about
his
coming
and
then
his
sister
eunice
came
out
and
he
could
not
speak
they
all
went
together
into
the
house
flaming
with
naphtha
gas
and
with
the
steam
heat
already
on
and
dan
said
he
would
take
his
bag
to
his
room
and
then
come
down
again
he
knew
that
he
had
left
them
to
think
that
there
was
something
very
mysterious
in
his
coming
and
while
he
washed
away
the
grime
of
his
journey
he
was
planning
how
to
appear
perfectly
natural
when
he
should
get
back
to
his
sisters
he
recollected
that
he
had
not
asked
either
them
or
his
father
how
his
mother
was
but
it
was
certainly
not
because
his
mind
was
not
full
of
her
alice
now
seemed
very
remote
from
him
further
even
than
his
gun
or
his
boyish
collection
of
moths
and
butterflies
on
which
his
eye
fell
in
roving
about
his
room
for
a
bitter
instant
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
they
were
all
alike
toys
and
in
a
sudden
despair
he
asked
himself
what
had
become
of
his
happiness
it
was
scarcely
half
a
day
since
he
had
parted
in
transport
from
alice
he
made
pretexts
to
keep
from
returning
at
once
to
his
sisters
and
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
before
he
went
down
to
them
by
that
time
his
father
was
with
them
in
the
library
and
they
were
waiting
tea
for
him
xxix
a
family
of
rich
people
in
the
country
apart
from
intellectual
interests
is
apt
to
gormandise
and
the
maverings
always
sat
down
to
a
luxurious
table
which
was
most
abundant
and
tempting
at
the
meal
they
called
tea
when
the
invention
of
the
portuguese
was
taxed
to
supply
the
demands
of
appetites
at
once
eager
and
fastidious
they
prolonged
the
meal
as
much
as
possible
in
winter
and
dan
used
to
like
to
get
home
just
in
time
for
tea
when
he
came
up
from
harvard
it
was
always
very
jolly
and
he
brought
a
boy
hunger
to
its
abundance
the
full
of
shining
light
and
treated
from
the
grate
was
a
pleasant
place
but
now
his
spirits
failed
to
rise
with
the
physical
cheer
he
was
almost
bashfully
silent
he
sat
cowed
in
the
presence
of
his
sisters
and
careworn
in
the
place
where
he
used
to
be
so
gay
and
bold
they
were
waiting
to
have
him
begin
about
himself
as
he
always
did
when
he
had
been
away
and
were
ready
to
sympathise
with
his
egotism
whatever
new
turn
it
took
he
mystified
them
by
asking
about
them
and
their
affairs
and
by
dealing
in
futile
generalities
instead
of
launching
out
with
any
business
that
he
happened
at
the
time
to
be
full
of
but
he
did
not
attend
to
their
answers
to
his
questions
he
was
and
only
knew
that
his
face
was
flushed
and
that
he
was
obviously
ill
at
ease
his
younger
sister
turned
from
him
impatiently
at
last
father
what
is
the
matter
with
dan
her
bold
recognition
of
their
common
constraint
broke
it
down
dan
looked
at
his
father
with
helpless
consent
and
his
father
said
quietly
he
tells
me
he
what
nonsense
said
his
sister
eunice
why
dan
cried
minnie
and
he
felt
a
reproach
in
her
words
which
the
words
did
not
express
a
silence
followed
in
which
the
father
along
went
on
with
his
supper
the
girls
sat
staring
at
dan
with
incredulous
eyes
he
became
suddenly
angry
i
do
know
what
so
very
extraordinary
about
it
or
why
there
should
be
such
a
pother
he
began
and
he
knew
that
he
was
insolently
ignoring
abundant
reasons
for
pother
if
there
had
been
any
pother
yes
he
expected
now
that
they
would
believe
him
and
ask
whom
he
was
engaged
to
but
apparently
they
were
still
unable
to
realise
it
he
was
obliged
to
go
on
i
engaged
to
miss
to
miss
pasmer
repeated
eunice
but
i
thought
minnie
began
and
then
stopped
dan
commanded
his
temper
by
a
strong
effort
and
condescended
to
explain
there
was
a
misunderstanding
but
it
all
right
now
i
only
met
her
yesterday
and
it
all
he
had
to
keep
on
ignoring
what
had
passed
between
him
and
his
sisters
during
the
month
he
spent
at
home
after
his
return
from
campobello
he
did
not
wish
to
do
so
he
would
have
been
glad
to
laugh
over
that
epoch
of
with
them
but
the
way
they
had
taken
the
fact
of
his
engagement
made
it
impossible
he
was
forced
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
they
forced
him
i
glad
he
added
bitterly
that
the
news
seems
to
be
so
agreeable
to
my
family
thank
you
for
your
cordial
he
swallowed
a
large
cup
of
tea
and
kept
looking
down
how
silly
said
eunice
who
was
much
the
oldest
of
the
three
did
you
expect
us
to
fall
upon
your
neck
before
we
could
believe
it
was
a
hoax
of
father
a
hoax
dan
burst
out
i
suppose
said
minnie
with
mock
meekness
that
if
we
to
be
devoured
it
no
use
saying
we
did
roil
the
brook
i
sure
i
congratulate
you
dan
with
all
my
heart
she
added
with
a
trembling
voice
i
congratulate
miss
pasmer
said
eunice
on
securing
such
a
very
reasonable
when
eunice
first
became
a
young
lady
she
was
so
much
older
than
dan
that
in
his
mother
absence
she
sometimes
authorised
herself
to
box
his
ears
till
she
was
finally
overthrown
in
battle
by
the
growing
boy
she
still
felt
herself
so
much
his
tutelary
genius
that
she
could
not
let
the
idea
of
his
engagement
awe
her
or
keep
her
from
giving
him
a
needed
lesson
dan
jumped
to
his
feet
and
passionately
threw
his
napkin
on
his
chair
there
that
will
do
eunice
interposed
the
father
sit
down
dan
and
do
be
an
ass
if
you
are
engaged
do
you
expect
to
come
up
here
with
a
bombshell
in
your
pocket
and
explode
it
among
us
without
causing
any
commotion
we
all
desire
your
happiness
and
we
are
glad
if
you
think
you
found
it
but
we
want
to
have
time
to
realise
it
we
had
only
adjusted
our
minds
to
the
apparent
fact
that
you
had
found
it
when
you
were
here
his
father
began
very
severely
but
when
he
ended
with
this
recognition
of
what
they
had
all
blinked
till
then
they
laughed
together
my
pillow
is
dry
yet
with
the
tears
i
shed
for
you
dan
said
minnie
demurely
i
shall
have
to
countermand
my
mourning
said
eunice
and
wear
louder
colours
than
ever
unless
she
added
miss
pasmer
changes
her
mind
this
divination
of
the
past
gave
them
all
a
chance
for
another
laugh
and
dan
sisters
began
to
reconcile
themselves
to
the
fact
of
his
engagement
if
not
to
miss
pasmer
in
what
was
abstractly
so
disagreeable
there
was
the
comfort
that
they
could
joke
about
his
happiness
they
had
not
felt
free
to
make
light
of
his
misery
when
he
was
at
home
before
they
began
to
ask
all
the
questions
they
could
think
of
as
to
how
and
when
and
they
assimilated
the
fact
more
and
more
in
acquiring
these
particulars
and
making
a
mock
of
them
and
him
of
course
you
have
got
her
photograph
suggested
eunice
you
know
we
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
young
lady
yes
dan
owned
blushing
i
have
she
thought
i
might
like
to
show
it
to
mother
but
it
is
a
very
good
one
they
never
are
said
minnie
and
it
was
taken
several
years
ago
they
always
are
said
eunice
and
she
does
photograph
well
and
this
one
was
just
after
a
long
fit
of
dan
drew
it
out
of
his
pocket
after
some
fumbling
for
it
while
he
tolerated
their
gibes
eunice
put
her
nose
to
it
i
hope
it
your
cigarettes
it
smells
of
she
said
yes
she
does
use
the
weed
answered
dan
oh
i
did
mean
that
exactly
returned
his
sister
holding
the
picture
off
at
arm
length
and
viewing
it
critically
with
contracted
eyes
dan
could
not
help
laughing
i
do
think
it
been
near
any
other
he
answered
tranquilly
minnie
looked
at
it
very
near
to
covering
all
but
the
face
with
her
hand
dan
she
lovely
she
cried
and
dan
heart
leaped
into
his
throat
as
he
gratefully
met
his
sister
eyes
you
like
her
eunice
took
the
photograph
from
her
for
a
second
scrutiny
certainly
very
stylish
rather
a
beak
of
a
nose
and
a
little
too
bird
like
on
the
whole
but
she
is
so
bad
is
it
like
her
she
asked
with
a
glance
at
her
father
i
might
say
after
looking
he
replied
true
i
did
know
but
dan
had
shown
it
to
you
as
soon
as
you
met
he
seemed
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
let
us
all
the
father
said
i
do
think
it
flatters
her
and
he
looked
at
it
more
carefully
not
much
of
her
mother
there
he
suggested
to
dan
no
sir
she
more
like
her
well
after
all
this
excitement
i
believe
i
have
another
cup
of
tea
and
take
something
to
eat
if
miss
pasmer
photograph
object
said
eunice
and
she
replenished
her
cup
and
plate
what
coloured
hair
and
eyes
has
she
dan
asked
minnie
he
had
to
think
so
as
to
be
exact
well
you
might
say
they
were
black
her
eyebrows
are
so
dark
but
i
believe
they
a
sort
of
not
an
uncommon
colour
for
eyes
said
eunice
but
rather
peculiar
for
they
got
to
making
fun
of
the
picture
and
dan
told
them
about
alice
and
her
family
the
father
left
them
at
the
table
and
then
came
back
with
word
from
dan
mother
that
she
was
ready
to
see
him
xxx
by
eight
in
the
evening
the
pain
with
which
every
day
began
for
mavering
was
lulled
and
her
jarred
nerves
were
stayed
by
the
opiates
till
she
fell
asleep
about
midnight
in
this
interval
the
family
gathered
into
her
room
and
brought
her
their
news
and
the
cheer
of
their
health
the
girls
chattered
on
one
side
of
her
bed
and
their
father
sat
with
his
newspaper
on
the
other
and
read
aloud
the
passages
which
he
thought
would
interest
her
while
she
lay
propped
among
her
pillows
brilliantly
eager
for
the
world
opening
this
glimpse
of
itself
to
her
shining
eyes
that
was
on
her
good
nights
when
the
drugs
did
their
work
but
there
were
times
when
they
failed
and
the
day
agony
prolonged
itself
through
the
evening
and
the
sleep
won
at
last
was
a
heavy
stupor
then
the
sufferer
temper
gave
way
under
the
stress
she
became
the
torment
she
suffered
and
tore
the
hearts
she
loved
most
of
all
she
afflicted
the
man
who
had
been
so
faithful
to
her
misery
and
maddened
him
to
reprisals
of
which
he
afterward
abjectly
repented
her
tongue
was
sharpened
by
pain
and
pitilessly
skilled
to
inculpate
and
to
punish
it
pierced
and
burned
like
fire
but
when
a
good
day
came
again
she
made
it
up
to
the
victims
by
the
angelic
sweetness
and
sanity
which
they
felt
was
her
real
self
the
cruelty
was
only
the
mask
of
her
suffering
when
she
was
better
they
brought
to
her
room
anybody
who
was
staying
with
them
and
she
liked
them
to
be
jolly
in
the
spacious
chamber
the
pleasantest
things
of
the
house
were
assembled
and
all
its
comforts
concentrated
in
the
place
which
she
and
they
knew
she
should
quit
but
once
it
was
made
gay
with
flowers
and
pictures
it
was
the
salon
for
those
fortunate
hours
when
she
became
the
lightest
and
blithest
of
the
company
in
it
and
made
the
youngest
guest
forget
that
there
was
sickness
or
pain
in
the
world
by
the
spirit
with
which
she
ignored
her
own
her
laugh
became
young
again
she
joked
she
entered
into
what
they
were
doing
and
reading
and
thinking
and
sent
them
away
full
of
the
sympathy
which
in
this
mood
of
hers
she
had
for
every
mood
in
others
girls
sighed
out
their
wonder
and
envy
to
her
daughters
when
they
left
her
the
young
men
whom
she
captivated
with
her
divination
of
their
passions
or
ambitions
went
away
celebrating
her
supernatural
knowledge
of
human
nature
the
next
evening
after
some
night
of
rare
and
happy
excitement
the
family
saw
her
nurse
carrying
the
pictures
and
flowers
and
vases
out
of
her
room
in
sign
of
her
renunciation
of
them
all
and
assembled
silently
shrinkingly
in
her
chamber
to
take
each
their
portion
of
her
anguish
of
the
blame
and
the
penalty
the
household
adjusted
itself
to
her
humours
for
she
was
supreme
in
it
when
dan
used
to
come
home
from
harvard
she
put
on
a
pretty
cap
for
him
and
distinguished
him
as
company
by
certain
laces
hiding
her
wasted
frame
and
giving
their
pathetic
coquetry
to
her
transparent
wrists
he
was
her
favourite
and
the
girls
acknowledged
him
so
and
made
their
fun
of
her
for
spoiling
him
he
found
out
as
he
grew
up
that
her
broken
health
dated
from
his
birth
and
at
first
this
deeply
affected
him
but
his
young
life
soon
lost
the
keenness
of
the
impression
and
he
loved
his
mother
because
she
loved
him
and
not
because
she
had
been
dying
for
him
so
many
years
as
he
now
came
into
her
room
and
the
went
out
of
it
with
her
usual
well
dan
the
tenderness
which
filled
him
at
sight
of
his
mother
was
mixed
with
that
sense
of
guilt
which
had
tormented
him
at
times
ever
since
he
met
his
sisters
he
was
going
to
take
himself
from
her
he
realised
that
well
dan
she
called
so
gaily
that
he
said
to
himself
no
father
has
told
her
anything
about
it
and
was
instantly
able
to
answer
her
as
cheerfully
well
mother
he
bent
over
her
to
kiss
her
and
the
odour
of
the
clean
linen
mingling
with
that
of
the
opium
and
the
cologne
with
which
she
had
tried
to
banish
its
scent
opened
to
him
one
of
those
vast
reaches
of
associations
which
perfumes
can
unlock
and
he
saw
her
lying
there
through
those
years
of
pain
as
many
as
half
his
life
and
suddenly
the
tears
gushed
into
his
eyes
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
the
and
sobbed
she
kept
smoothing
his
head
which
shook
under
her
thin
hand
and
saying
poor
dan
poor
dan
but
did
not
question
him
he
knew
that
she
knew
what
he
had
come
to
tell
her
and
that
his
tears
which
had
not
been
meant
for
that
had
made
interest
with
her
for
him
and
his
cause
and
that
she
was
already
on
his
side
he
tried
boyishly
to
dignify
the
situation
when
he
lifted
his
face
and
he
said
i
did
mean
to
come
boohooing
to
you
in
this
way
and
ashamed
of
i
know
dan
but
you
been
wrought
up
and
i
do
wonder
you
must
mind
your
father
and
your
sisters
of
course
they
rather
surprised
and
they
do
like
your
taking
yourself
from
them
we
none
of
us
at
these
honest
words
dan
tried
to
become
honest
too
at
least
he
dropped
his
pretence
of
dignity
and
became
as
a
little
child
in
his
simple
greed
for
sympathy
but
it
is
necessarily
that
is
it
mother
yes
it
all
that
dan
and
it
all
right
because
it
that
we
do
like
it
but
our
not
liking
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
being
right
or
i
supposed
that
father
would
have
been
pleased
anyway
for
he
has
seen
her
and
and
of
course
the
girls
have
but
i
think
they
might
have
trusted
my
judgment
a
little
i
not
quite
a
his
mother
smiled
oh
it
is
a
question
of
the
wisdom
of
your
choice
it
the
unexpectedness
we
all
saw
that
you
were
very
unhappy
when
you
were
here
before
and
we
supposed
it
had
gone
it
had
mother
said
dan
she
refused
me
at
campobello
but
it
was
a
misunderstanding
and
as
soon
as
we
met
i
knew
you
had
met
again
and
what
you
had
come
home
for
and
i
told
your
father
so
when
he
came
to
say
you
were
did
you
mother
he
asked
charmed
at
her
having
guessed
that
yes
she
must
be
a
good
girl
to
send
you
straight
home
to
tell
you
knew
i
would
have
thought
of
that
myself
said
dan
joyously
i
wanted
to
write
i
thought
that
would
do
just
as
well
i
hated
to
leave
her
but
she
made
me
come
she
is
the
best
and
the
wisest
and
the
most
unselfish
o
mother
i
ca
tell
you
about
her
you
must
see
her
you
ca
realise
her
till
you
see
her
mother
you
like
each
other
i
sure
of
that
you
just
it
seemed
to
dan
that
they
were
exactly
alike
then
perhaps
we
suggested
his
mother
let
me
see
her
how
did
you
know
i
had
it
if
it
had
been
for
her
i
should
have
brought
any
she
put
it
into
my
pocket
just
as
i
was
leaving
she
said
you
would
all
want
to
see
what
she
looked
he
had
taken
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
he
held
it
smiling
fondly
upon
it
alice
seemed
to
smile
back
at
him
he
had
lost
her
in
the
reluctance
of
his
father
and
sisters
and
now
his
mother
it
was
his
mother
who
had
given
her
to
him
again
he
thought
how
tenderly
he
loved
his
mother
when
he
could
yield
her
the
photograph
she
looked
long
and
silently
at
it
she
has
a
great
deal
of
character
there
you
hit
it
mother
i
rather
you
would
have
said
that
than
anything
else
but
do
you
think
she
beautiful
she
the
gentlest
creature
when
you
come
to
know
her
i
was
awfully
afraid
of
her
at
first
i
thought
she
was
very
haughty
but
she
is
at
all
really
very
she
thinks
she
is
good
enough
for
me
you
ought
to
hear
her
talk
mother
as
i
have
she
full
of
the
noblest
ideals
of
being
of
some
use
in
the
world
of
being
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
you
can
see
that
she
capable
of
it
her
aunt
in
a
protestant
sisterhood
he
said
with
a
solemnity
which
did
not
seem
to
communicate
itself
to
his
mother
for
mavering
smiled
dan
smiled
too
and
said
but
i
ca
tell
you
about
alice
mother
she
his
heart
overflowed
with
proud
delight
in
her
and
he
was
fool
enough
to
add
she
so
affectionate
his
mother
kept
herself
from
laughing
i
dare
say
she
is
dan
with
then
she
hid
all
but
her
eyes
with
the
photograph
and
gave
way
what
a
donkey
said
dan
meaning
himself
if
i
go
on
i
shall
disgust
you
with
her
what
i
mean
is
that
she
is
at
all
proud
as
i
used
to
think
she
no
girl
is
under
the
circumstances
she
has
all
she
can
do
to
be
proud
of
do
you
think
so
mother
he
said
enraptured
with
the
notion
done
my
best
or
my
worst
not
to
give
her
any
reason
to
be
she
does
any
the
less
the
better
you
silly
boy
do
you
suppose
she
wants
to
make
you
out
of
whole
cloth
just
as
you
do
with
her
she
does
want
any
facts
to
start
with
they
be
in
the
way
well
now
i
can
make
out
with
your
help
what
the
young
lady
is
but
what
are
the
father
and
mother
they
rather
important
in
these
oh
they
the
nicest
kind
of
people
said
dan
in
optimistic
generalisation
you
like
pasmer
she
awfully
do
you
say
that
because
you
think
i
would
asked
his
mother
she
rather
sly
and
well
yes
she
is
to
a
certain
extent
dan
admitted
with
a
laugh
but
she
does
mean
any
harm
by
it
she
extremely
to
you
i
dare
say
and
pasmer
is
rather
under
her
thumb
well
yes
you
might
say
thumb
dan
consented
feeling
it
useless
to
defend
the
pasmers
against
this
analysis
we
wo
say
heel
returned
his
mother
we
too
polite
and
your
father
says
he
had
the
reputation
in
college
of
being
one
of
the
most
selfish
fellows
in
the
world
he
never
done
anything
since
but
lose
most
of
his
money
he
been
absolutely
idle
and
useless
all
his
she
turned
her
vivid
blue
eyes
suddenly
upon
her
son
dan
winced
you
know
how
hard
father
is
upon
people
who
have
done
anything
it
a
mania
of
his
of
course
pasmer
does
show
to
advantage
where
there
no
no
leisure
poor
man
dan
was
going
to
say
he
very
amiable
though
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
mother
retorting
to
you
and
he
held
his
peace
looking
chapfallen
whether
his
mother
took
pity
on
him
or
not
her
next
sally
was
consoling
but
your
alice
may
not
take
after
either
of
them
her
father
is
the
worst
of
his
breed
it
seems
the
rest
are
useful
people
from
what
your
father
knows
and
there
a
great
deal
to
be
hoped
for
collaterally
she
had
an
uncle
in
college
at
the
same
time
who
was
everything
that
her
father
was
one
of
her
aunts
is
in
one
of
those
protestant
religious
houses
in
england
repeated
dan
oh
said
his
mother
shortly
i
do
know
that
i
like
that
particularly
but
probably
she
is
useless
there
is
alice
very
religious
well
i
suppose
said
dan
with
a
smile
for
the
devotions
that
came
into
his
thought
she
what
would
be
called
mavering
referred
to
the
photograph
which
she
still
held
in
her
hand
well
she
pure
and
good
at
any
rate
i
suppose
you
look
forward
to
a
long
engagement
dan
was
somewhat
taken
aback
at
a
supposition
so
very
contrary
to
what
was
in
his
mind
well
i
do
know
why
it
might
be
said
that
you
are
very
young
how
old
is
agnes
alice
i
mean
but
now
look
here
mother
it
no
use
considering
such
a
thing
in
the
abstract
is
it
no
said
his
mother
with
a
smile
for
what
might
be
coming
this
is
the
way
i
been
viewing
it
i
may
say
it
the
way
alice
has
been
viewing
it
or
pasmer
decidedly
pasmer
rather
better
be
honest
i
do
my
best
i
was
thinking
hoping
that
is
that
as
i
going
right
into
the
business
have
gone
into
it
already
in
fact
and
could
begin
life
at
once
that
perhaps
there
would
be
much
sense
in
waiting
a
great
yes
that
all
that
is
if
you
and
father
are
he
reflected
upon
this
provision
and
added
with
a
laugh
of
confusion
and
pleasure
it
seems
to
be
so
very
much
more
of
a
family
affair
than
i
used
to
think
it
you
thought
it
concerned
just
you
and
her
said
his
mother
with
arch
sympathy
well
poor
fellow
she
knew
better
than
that
you
may
be
sure
at
any
rate
her
mother
what
pasmer
does
know
is
probably
worth
knowing
said
dan
with
an
amused
sense
of
her
omniscience
i
thought
so
sighed
his
mother
smiling
too
and
now
you
begin
to
find
out
that
it
concerns
the
families
in
all
their
branches
on
both
oh
if
it
stopped
at
the
families
and
their
ramifications
but
it
seems
to
take
in
society
and
the
general
so
it
does
more
than
you
can
realise
you
ca
get
married
to
yourself
alone
as
young
people
think
and
if
you
do
marry
happily
you
sin
against
the
peace
and
comfort
of
the
whole
yes
that
what
i
chiefly
looking
out
for
now
i
do
want
any
of
those
people
in
central
africa
to
suffer
that
the
reason
i
want
to
marry
alice
at
the
earliest
opportunity
but
i
suppose
there
have
to
be
a
mavering
embassy
to
the
high
contracting
powers
of
the
other
part
now
your
father
and
one
of
the
girls
had
better
go
yes
and
invite
and
pasmer
and
their
daughter
to
come
up
all
on
probation
oh
no
if
you
pleased
dan
i
am
mother
they
both
laughed
at
this
mild
way
of
putting
it
why
then
it
to
be
supposed
that
we
all
pleased
you
need
bring
the
whole
pasmer
family
home
to
live
with
you
if
you
do
marry
them
no
said
dan
and
suddenly
he
became
very
distraught
it
flashed
through
him
that
his
mother
was
expecting
him
to
come
home
with
alice
to
live
and
that
she
would
not
be
at
all
pleased
with
his
scheme
of
a
european
sojourn
which
pasmer
had
so
cordially
adopted
he
was
amazed
that
he
had
not
thought
of
that
but
he
refused
to
see
any
difficulty
which
his
happiness
could
not
cope
with
no
there
that
view
of
it
he
said
jollily
and
he
buried
his
momentary
anxiety
out
of
sight
and
as
it
were
danced
upon
its
grave
nevertheless
he
had
a
desire
to
get
quickly
away
from
the
spot
i
hope
the
mavering
embassy
wo
be
a
great
while
getting
ready
to
go
he
said
of
course
it
all
right
but
i
should
want
an
appearance
of
reluctance
exactly
you
know
mother
and
if
there
should
be
much
of
an
interval
between
my
getting
back
and
their
coming
on
do
you
know
why
the
cat
might
let
herself
out
of
the
what
cat
asked
his
mother
demurely
well
you
know
you
have
received
my
engagement
with
unmingled
enthusiasm
and
and
i
suppose
they
would
find
it
out
from
me
from
my
manner
and
and
i
wish
they
come
along
pretty
soon
poor
boy
i
afraid
the
cat
got
out
of
the
bag
when
pasmer
came
to
the
years
of
discretion
but
you
be
left
a
prey
to
her
they
shall
go
back
with
you
ring
the
bell
and
let
talk
it
over
with
them
dan
joyfully
obeyed
he
could
see
that
his
mother
was
all
on
fire
with
interest
in
his
affair
and
that
the
idea
of
somehow
circumventing
pasmer
by
prompt
action
was
fascinating
her
his
sisters
came
up
at
once
and
his
father
followed
a
moment
later
they
all
took
their
cue
from
the
mother
gaiety
and
began
talking
and
laughing
except
the
father
who
sat
looking
on
with
a
smile
at
their
lively
spirits
and
the
jokes
of
which
dan
became
the
victim
each
family
has
its
own
fantastic
medium
in
which
it
gets
affairs
to
relieve
them
of
their
concrete
seriousness
and
the
maverings
now
did
this
with
engagement
and
played
with
it
as
an
airy
abstraction
they
debated
the
character
of
the
embassy
which
was
to
be
sent
down
to
boston
on
their
behalf
and
it
was
decided
that
eunice
had
better
go
with
her
father
as
representing
more
fully
the
age
and
respectability
of
the
family
at
first
glance
the
pasmers
would
take
her
for
dan
mother
and
this
would
be
a
tremendous
advantage
and
if
i
like
the
ridiculous
little
chit
said
eunice
i
think
i
shall
let
dan
marry
her
at
once
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
and
i
could
stand
a
long
engagement
i
should
break
it
i
guess
there
are
others
who
will
have
something
to
say
about
that
retorted
the
younger
sister
i
always
wanted
a
long
engagement
in
this
family
and
as
there
seems
to
be
no
chance
for
it
with
the
ladies
i
wish
to
make
the
most
of
dan
i
always
like
it
where
the
hero
gets
sick
and
the
heroine
nurses
him
i
want
dan
to
get
sick
and
have
alice
come
here
and
take
care
of
no
this
marriage
must
take
place
at
once
what
do
you
say
father
asked
eunice
her
father
sat
enjoying
the
talk
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
a
tendency
to
doze
you
might
ask
dan
he
said
with
a
lazy
cast
of
his
eye
toward
his
son
dan
has
nothing
to
do
with
dan
shall
not
be
the
two
girls
stormed
upon
their
father
with
their
different
reasons
now
i
will
tell
you
girls
be
still
their
mother
broke
in
listen
to
me
i
have
an
listen
to
her
she
has
an
idea
echoed
eunice
in
recitative
will
you
be
quiet
demanded
the
mother
we
will
be
when
they
became
so
at
the
verge
of
their
mother
patience
of
which
they
knew
the
limits
she
went
on
i
think
dan
had
better
get
married
at
there
minnie
but
what
does
dan
say
i
will
make
the
sacrifice
said
dan
meekly
noble
boy
that
exactly
what
washington
said
to
his
mother
when
she
asked
him
not
to
go
to
sea
said
minnie
and
then
he
went
into
the
militia
and
made
it
all
right
with
himself
that
way
said
eunice
dan
ca
play
his
filial
piety
on
this
family
go
on
i
want
him
to
bring
his
wife
home
and
live
with
us
continued
his
mother
in
the
l
part
cried
minnie
clasping
her
hands
in
rapture
always
said
what
a
perfect
little
apartment
it
was
by
well
do
say
it
again
then
returned
her
sister
always
is
often
enough
well
in
the
l
part
go
on
mother
do
ask
where
you
were
when
it
so
i
do
care
whether
it
in
the
l
part
or
not
there
plenty
of
room
in
the
great
barn
of
a
place
but
what
about
his
taking
care
of
the
business
in
boston
suggested
eunice
looking
at
her
father
there
no
hurry
about
and
about
the
excursion
to
aesthetic
centres
abroad
minnie
added
that
could
be
managed
said
her
father
with
the
same
ironical
smile
the
mother
and
the
girls
went
on
wildly
planning
dan
future
for
him
it
was
all
in
a
strain
of
extravagant
burlesque
but
he
could
not
take
his
part
in
it
with
his
usual
zest
he
laughed
and
joked
too
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
was
an
uneasy
remembrance
of
the
different
future
he
had
talked
over
with
pasmer
so
confidently
but
he
said
to
himself
buoyantly
at
last
that
it
would
come
out
all
right
his
mother
would
give
in
or
else
alice
could
reconcile
her
mother
to
whatever
seemed
really
best
he
parted
from
his
mother
with
fond
gaiety
his
sisters
came
out
of
the
room
with
him
i
perfectly
sore
with
laughing
said
minnie
it
seems
like
old
times
does
it
dan
such
a
gale
with
xxxi
an
engagement
must
always
be
a
little
incredible
at
first
to
the
families
of
the
betrothed
and
especially
to
the
family
of
the
young
man
in
the
girl
the
mother
at
least
will
have
a
more
realising
sense
of
the
situation
if
there
are
elder
sisters
who
have
been
accustomed
to
regard
their
brother
as
very
young
he
will
seem
all
the
younger
because
in
such
a
matter
he
has
treated
himself
as
if
he
were
a
man
and
eunice
mavering
said
after
seeing
the
pasmers
well
dan
it
all
well
enough
i
suppose
but
it
seems
too
what
ridiculous
about
it
i
should
like
to
know
he
demanded
oh
i
do
know
who
look
after
you
when
you
married
oh
i
forgot
pasmer
i
guess
we
shall
be
able
to
look
after
ourselves
said
dan
a
little
sulkily
yes
if
you
be
allowed
to
insinuated
his
sister
they
spoke
at
the
end
of
a
talk
in
which
he
had
fretted
at
the
reticence
of
both
his
sister
and
his
father
concerning
the
pasmers
whom
they
had
just
been
to
see
he
was
vexed
with
his
father
because
he
felt
that
he
had
been
influenced
by
eunice
and
had
somehow
gone
back
on
him
he
was
vexed
and
he
was
grieved
because
his
father
had
left
them
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
without
saying
anything
in
praise
of
alice
beyond
the
generalities
that
would
not
carry
favour
with
eunice
and
he
was
depressed
with
a
certain
sense
of
alice
father
and
mother
which
seemed
to
have
imparted
itself
to
him
from
the
others
and
to
be
the
mavering
opinion
of
them
he
could
no
longer
see
pasmer
harmless
if
trivial
and
if
inveterately
scheming
he
could
not
see
the
dignity
and
refinement
which
he
had
believed
in
pasmer
they
had
both
suffered
a
sort
of
shrinkage
or
collapse
from
which
he
could
not
rehabilitate
them
but
this
would
have
been
nothing
if
his
sister
and
his
father
eyes
through
which
he
seemed
to
have
been
looking
had
not
shown
him
alice
in
a
light
in
which
she
appeared
strange
and
queer
almost
to
eccentricity
he
was
hurt
at
this
effect
from
their
want
of
sympathy
his
pride
was
touched
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
should
not
fish
for
eunice
praise
but
he
found
himself
saying
without
surprise
i
suppose
you
will
do
what
you
can
to
prejudice
mother
and
is
that
a
little
previous
asked
eunice
have
i
said
anything
against
miss
pasmer
you
have
because
you
could
said
dan
with
foolish
bitterness
oh
i
do
know
about
that
she
a
human
being
i
suppose
at
least
that
was
the
impression
i
got
from
her
what
have
you
got
to
say
against
her
parents
demanded
dan
savagely
oh
nothing
i
did
come
down
to
boston
to
denounce
the
pasmer
i
suppose
you
did
like
their
being
in
a
flat
you
have
liked
to
find
them
in
a
house
on
commonwealth
avenue
or
beacon
i
own
i
a
snob
said
eunice
with
maddening
meekness
they
are
connected
with
the
best
families
in
the
city
and
they
are
in
the
best
society
they
do
what
they
please
and
they
live
where
they
like
they
have
been
so
long
in
europe
that
they
do
care
for
those
silly
distinctions
but
what
you
say
does
harm
them
it
simply
disgraceful
to
you
that
all
said
dan
furiously
i
glad
it
no
worse
dan
said
his
sister
with
a
tranquil
smile
and
if
you
stop
prancing
up
and
down
the
room
and
take
a
seat
and
behave
yourself
in
a
christian
manner
i
talk
with
you
and
if
you
do
i
wo
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
be
bullied
into
liking
them
you
can
like
them
or
not
as
you
please
said
dan
sullenly
but
he
sat
down
and
waited
decently
for
his
sister
to
speak
but
you
ca
abuse
them
at
least
in
my
i
did
know
men
lost
their
heads
as
well
as
their
hearts
said
eunice
perhaps
it
only
an
exchange
though
and
it
miss
dan
started
but
did
not
say
anything
and
eunice
smoothly
continued
no
i
do
believe
it
is
she
looked
like
a
sensible
girl
and
she
talked
sensibly
i
should
think
she
had
a
very
good
head
she
has
good
manners
and
she
extremely
pretty
and
very
graceful
surprised
she
should
be
in
love
with
such
a
oh
go
on
abuse
me
as
much
as
you
like
said
dan
he
was
at
once
soothed
by
her
praise
of
alice
no
it
is
necessary
to
go
on
the
case
is
a
little
too
obvious
but
i
think
she
will
do
very
well
i
hope
you
not
marrying
the
whole
family
though
i
suppose
that
it
always
a
question
of
which
shall
be
scooped
up
they
will
want
to
scoop
you
up
and
we
shall
want
to
scoop
her
up
i
dare
say
pasmer
has
her
little
plan
what
is
it
dan
started
at
this
touch
on
the
quick
but
he
controlled
himself
and
said
with
dignity
i
have
my
own
well
you
know
what
mother
are
returned
eunice
easily
you
seem
so
cheerful
that
i
suppose
yours
are
quite
the
same
and
you
just
keeping
them
for
a
she
laughed
provokingly
and
dan
burst
forth
again
you
seem
to
live
to
give
people
pain
you
take
a
fiendish
delight
in
torturing
others
but
if
you
think
you
can
influence
me
in
the
slightest
degree
you
very
much
well
well
there
it
be
teased
any
more
so
it
it
shall
have
its
own
way
it
shall
and
nobody
shall
say
a
word
against
its
little
girly
eunice
rose
from
her
chair
and
patted
dan
on
the
head
as
she
passed
to
the
adjoining
room
he
caught
her
hand
and
flung
it
violently
away
she
shrieked
with
delight
in
his
childish
resentment
and
left
him
sulking
she
was
gone
two
or
three
minutes
and
when
she
came
back
it
was
in
quite
a
different
mood
as
often
happens
with
women
in
a
little
lapse
of
time
dan
i
think
miss
pasmer
is
a
beautiful
girl
and
i
know
we
shall
all
like
her
if
you
do
set
us
against
her
by
your
arrogance
of
course
we
do
know
anything
about
her
yet
and
you
do
really
but
she
seems
a
very
lovable
little
thing
and
if
she
rather
silent
and
undemonstrative
why
she
be
all
the
better
for
you
you
got
demonstration
enough
for
twenty
and
i
think
the
family
are
well
enough
pasmer
is
thoroughly
harmless
and
pasmer
is
a
most
dignified
personage
his
eyebrows
alone
are
worth
the
price
of
dan
could
not
help
smiling
all
that
there
is
about
it
is
you
expect
to
drive
people
into
raptures
about
them
and
expect
them
to
go
grovelling
round
on
their
knees
because
you
oh
i
know
i
an
infernal
idiot
said
dan
yielding
to
the
mingled
sarcasm
and
flattery
it
because
i
so
anxious
and
you
all
seem
so
confoundedly
provisional
about
it
eunice
what
do
you
suppose
father
really
thinks
eunice
seemed
tempted
to
a
relapse
into
her
teasing
but
she
did
not
yield
oh
father
all
right
from
your
point
of
view
he
been
ridiculous
from
the
first
perhaps
that
the
reason
he
does
feel
obliged
to
expatiate
and
expand
a
great
deal
at
do
you
think
so
cried
dan
instantly
adopting
her
as
an
ally
well
if
i
sad
so
ought
it
to
be
enough
it
depends
upon
what
else
you
say
look
here
now
eunice
dan
said
with
a
laughing
mixture
of
fun
and
earnest
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
mother
it
no
use
being
disagreeable
is
it
of
course
i
contend
for
ideal
perfection
anywhere
and
i
do
expect
it
but
there
is
anything
experimental
about
this
thing
and
do
you
think
we
had
better
all
make
the
best
of
it
that
sounds
very
it
is
impartial
i
a
purely
disinterested
oh
and
do
you
suppose
i
understand
and
pasmer
quite
as
well
as
you
do
all
i
say
is
that
alice
is
simply
the
noblest
girl
that
ever
breathed
and
now
you
talking
sense
dan
well
what
are
you
going
to
say
when
you
get
home
eunice
come
that
we
had
better
make
the
best
of
and
what
else
that
you
hopelessly
infatuated
and
that
she
will
twist
you
round
her
well
but
that
you
had
your
own
way
so
much
it
will
do
you
good
to
have
somebody
else
a
i
guess
you
pretty
solid
said
dan
after
thinking
it
over
for
a
moment
i
do
believe
you
going
to
make
it
hard
for
me
and
i
know
you
can
make
it
just
what
you
please
but
i
want
you
to
be
frank
with
mother
of
course
i
wish
you
felt
about
the
whole
affair
just
as
i
do
but
if
you
right
on
the
main
question
i
do
care
for
the
rest
rather
mother
would
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
said
dan
with
a
sigh
for
the
honesty
which
he
felt
to
be
not
immediately
attainable
in
his
own
case
well
i
see
what
can
be
done
eunice
finally
assented
whatever
her
feelings
were
in
regard
to
the
matter
she
must
have
satisfied
herself
that
the
situation
was
not
to
be
changed
by
her
disliking
it
and
she
began
to
talk
so
sympathetically
with
dan
that
she
soon
had
the
whole
story
of
his
love
out
of
him
they
laughed
a
good
deal
together
at
it
but
it
convinced
her
that
he
had
not
been
hoodwinked
into
the
engagement
it
is
always
the
belief
of
a
young
family
especially
his
mother
and
sisters
that
unfair
means
have
been
used
to
win
him
if
the
family
of
his
betrothed
are
unknown
to
them
and
it
was
a
relief
if
not
exactly
a
comfort
for
eunice
mavering
to
find
that
alice
was
as
great
a
simpleton
as
dan
and
perhaps
a
sincerer
simpleton
xxxii
a
week
later
in
fulfilment
of
the
arrangement
made
by
pasmer
and
eunice
mavering
alice
and
her
mother
returned
the
formal
visit
of
people
while
alice
stood
before
the
mirror
in
one
of
the
sumptuously
furnished
rooms
assigned
them
arranging
a
ribbon
for
the
effect
upon
dan
mother
after
dinner
and
regarding
its
relation
to
her
serious
beauty
pasmer
came
out
of
her
chamber
adjoining
and
began
to
inspect
the
formal
splendour
of
the
place
what
a
perfect
man
house
she
said
peering
about
you
can
see
that
everything
has
been
done
to
order
they
have
their
own
taste
artistic
enough
for
that
or
the
father
is
and
they
given
orders
to
have
things
done
so
and
so
and
the
new
york
upholsterer
has
come
up
and
taken
the
measure
of
the
rooms
and
done
it
but
it
is
like
new
york
and
it
is
individual
the
whole
house
is
just
like
those
costumes
in
character
they
were
made
in
new
york
but
they
do
wear
them
with
the
new
york
style
there
no
more
atmosphere
about
them
than
if
they
were
young
men
dressed
up
there
is
a
thing
lacking
in
the
house
here
there
an
awful
completeness
but
even
the
ornaments
seem
laid
on
like
the
hot
and
cold
water
i
never
saw
a
handsomer
more
uninviting
room
than
that
drawing
room
i
suppose
the
etching
will
come
some
time
after
supper
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
alice
oh
i
do
know
they
must
be
very
rich
said
the
girl
indifferently
you
ca
tell
country
people
of
a
certain
kind
are
apt
to
put
everything
on
their
backs
and
their
walls
and
floors
of
course
such
a
house
here
does
mean
what
it
would
in
she
examined
the
texture
of
the
carpet
more
critically
and
the
curtains
she
had
no
shame
about
a
curiosity
that
made
her
daughter
shrink
do
mamma
pleaded
the
girl
what
if
they
should
come
they
wo
come
said
pasmer
and
her
notice
being
called
to
alice
she
made
her
take
off
the
ribbon
you
better
without
i
so
nervous
i
do
know
what
i
doing
said
alice
removing
it
with
a
whimper
well
i
ca
have
you
breaking
down
cried
her
mother
warningly
she
really
wished
to
shake
her
as
a
culmination
of
her
own
conflicting
emotions
alice
stop
this
instant
stop
it
i
say
but
if
i
do
like
her
whimpered
alice
you
not
going
to
marry
her
now
stop
here
bathe
your
eyes
all
red
though
i
do
know
that
it
matters
yes
they
expect
you
to
have
been
crying
said
pasmer
seeing
the
situation
more
and
more
clearly
it
perfectly
but
she
took
some
cologne
on
a
handkerchief
and
recomposed
alice
countenance
for
her
there
the
colour
becomes
you
and
i
never
saw
your
eyes
look
so
there
was
a
pathos
in
their
brilliancy
which
of
course
betrayed
her
to
the
mavering
girls
it
softened
eunice
and
encouraged
minnie
who
had
been
a
little
afraid
of
the
pasmers
they
both
kissed
alice
with
sisterly
affection
their
father
merely
saw
how
handsome
she
looked
and
dan
heart
seemed
to
melt
in
his
breast
with
tenderness
in
recognition
of
the
different
habits
of
their
guests
they
had
dinner
instead
of
tea
the
portuguese
cook
had
outdone
himself
and
course
followed
course
in
triumphal
succession
pasmer
praised
it
all
with
a
sincerity
that
took
away
a
little
of
the
zest
she
felt
in
making
flattering
speeches
everything
about
the
table
was
perfect
but
in
a
man
fashion
like
the
rest
of
the
house
it
lacked
the
atmospheric
charm
the
otherwise
indefinable
grace
which
a
woman
taste
gives
it
was
in
fact
elbridge
mavering
taste
which
had
characterised
the
whole
the
daughters
simply
accepted
and
approved
yes
said
eunice
we
have
much
else
to
do
so
we
eat
and
joe
does
his
best
to
spoil
joe
joe
the
cook
all
portuguese
cooks
are
how
very
amusing
said
pasmer
you
must
let
me
speak
of
your
grapes
i
never
saw
anything
so
well
except
your
there
you
touched
father
in
two
tender
spots
he
cultivates
really
alice
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
these
roses
alice
looked
away
from
dan
a
moment
and
blushed
to
find
that
she
had
been
looking
so
long
at
him
ah
i
have
said
mavering
gallantly
does
he
often
do
it
asked
pasmer
in
an
obvious
aside
to
eunice
dan
answered
for
him
he
never
had
such
a
chance
between
coffee
which
they
drank
at
table
and
tea
which
they
were
to
take
in
mavering
room
they
acted
upon
a
suggestion
from
eunice
that
her
father
should
show
pasmer
his
at
one
end
of
the
was
a
little
apse
of
glass
full
of
flowering
plants
growing
out
of
the
ground
and
with
a
delicate
fountain
tinkling
in
their
midst
dan
ran
before
the
rest
and
opened
two
glass
doors
in
the
further
side
of
this
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
touch
flashed
up
a
succession
of
brilliant
lights
in
some
space
beyond
from
which
there
gushed
in
a
wave
of
hothouse
fragrance
warm
heavy
humid
it
was
a
pretty
little
effect
for
guests
new
to
the
house
and
was
part
of
elbridge
mavering
pleasure
in
this
feature
of
his
place
pasmer
responded
with
generous
sympathy
for
if
she
really
liked
anything
with
her
whole
heart
it
was
an
effect
and
she
traversed
the
by
its
pebbled
path
showering
praises
right
and
left
with
a
fulness
and
accuracy
that
missed
no
detail
while
alice
followed
silently
her
hand
in
minnie
mavering
and
cold
with
suppressed
excitement
the
was
divided
by
a
wall
pierced
with
frequent
doorways
over
which
the
trees
were
trained
and
the
roses
hung
and
on
either
side
were
ranks
of
rare
and
costly
kinds
weighed
down
with
bud
and
bloom
the
air
was
thick
with
their
breath
and
the
pungent
odours
of
the
rich
soil
from
which
they
grew
and
the
glass
roof
was
misted
with
the
mingled
exhalations
mavering
walked
beside
alice
modestly
explaining
the
difficulties
of
rose
culture
and
his
method
of
dealing
with
the
red
spider
he
had
a
stout
knife
in
his
hand
and
he
cropped
long
stems
of
roses
from
the
walls
and
the
beds
casually
giving
her
their
different
names
and
laying
them
along
his
arm
in
a
massive
sheaf
pasmer
and
eunice
had
gone
forward
with
dan
and
were
waiting
for
them
at
the
thither
end
of
the
alice
just
imagine
the
grapery
is
beyond
this
cried
the
mother
it
a
cold
grapery
said
mavering
i
hope
you
see
it
oh
why
not
shouted
dan
because
it
a
cold
grapery
said
eunice
and
after
this
it
an
arctic
grapery
you
crazy
well
i
want
alice
to
see
it
anyway
he
persisted
wilfully
nothing
like
a
cold
grapery
by
starlight
i
get
some
they
all
knew
that
he
wished
to
be
alone
with
her
a
moment
and
the
three
women
consenting
with
their
hearts
protested
with
their
tongues
following
him
in
his
flight
with
their
chorus
and
greeting
his
return
he
muffled
her
to
the
chin
in
a
overcoat
which
he
had
laid
hands
on
the
first
thing
and
her
mother
still
protesting
helped
to
tie
a
scarf
over
her
hair
so
as
not
to
disarrange
it
here
he
pointed
we
can
run
through
it
and
it
worth
seeing
better
come
he
said
to
the
others
as
he
opened
the
door
and
hurried
alice
down
the
path
under
the
keen
sparkle
of
the
crystal
roof
blotched
with
the
leaves
and
bunches
of
the
vines
coming
out
of
the
dense
sensuous
vaporous
air
of
the
into
this
clear
thin
atmosphere
delicately
penetrated
with
the
fragrance
pure
and
cold
of
the
fruit
it
was
as
if
they
had
entered
another
world
his
arm
crept
round
her
in
the
odorous
obscurity
look
up
see
the
stars
through
the
vines
but
when
she
lifted
her
face
he
bent
his
upon
it
for
a
wild
kiss
do
do
she
murmured
i
want
to
think
i
do
know
what
neither
do
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
blessed
perhaps
it
is
only
in
these
ecstasies
of
the
senses
that
the
soul
ever
reaches
on
earth
and
it
seems
to
be
only
the
which
finds
itself
even
in
this
abandon
the
has
always
something
else
to
think
of
what
shall
we
do
said
the
girl
if
we
oh
i
dread
to
meet
your
mother
is
she
like
either
of
your
sisters
no
he
cried
joyously
she
like
me
if
you
not
afraid
of
me
and
you
do
seem
to
be
you
all
i
have
you
all
i
have
in
the
world
do
you
think
like
me
oh
do
you
love
me
dan
you
darling
you
divine
the
rest
was
a
mad
embrace
if
you
not
afraid
of
me
you
wo
mind
mother
i
wanted
you
here
alone
for
just
a
last
word
to
tell
you
you
need
be
afraid
to
tell
you
to
but
i
need
tell
you
how
to
act
you
must
treat
her
as
an
invalid
you
must
treat
her
like
any
one
else
that
what
she
likes
but
you
know
what
best
alice
be
yourself
and
she
like
you
well
enough
not
xxxiii
when
she
entered
mavering
room
alice
first
saw
the
pictures
the
the
flowers
the
dazzle
of
lights
and
then
the
invalid
propped
among
her
pillows
and
vividly
expectant
of
her
she
seemed
all
eager
eyes
to
the
girl
aware
next
of
the
strong
resemblance
to
dan
in
her
features
and
of
the
careful
toilet
the
sick
woman
had
made
for
her
to
youth
all
forms
of
suffering
are
abhorrent
and
alice
had
to
hide
a
repugnance
at
sight
of
this
spectre
of
what
had
once
been
a
pretty
woman
through
the
egotism
with
which
so
many
years
of
flattering
subjection
in
her
little
world
had
armed
her
mavering
probably
did
not
feel
the
girl
shrinking
or
if
she
did
took
it
for
the
natural
embarrassment
which
she
would
feel
she
had
satisfied
herself
that
she
was
looking
her
best
and
that
her
cap
and
the
lace
jacket
she
wore
were
very
becoming
and
softened
her
worst
points
the
hangings
of
her
bed
and
the
richly
embroidered
crimson
silk
coverlet
were
part
of
the
coquetry
of
her
costume
from
which
habit
had
taken
all
sense
of
ghastliness
she
was
proud
of
them
and
she
was
not
aware
of
the
scent
of
drugs
that
insisted
through
the
odour
of
the
flowers
she
lifted
herself
on
her
elbow
as
dan
approached
with
alice
and
the
girl
felt
as
if
an
intense
light
had
been
thrown
upon
her
from
head
to
foot
in
the
moment
of
searching
scrutiny
that
followed
the
set
look
broke
into
a
smile
and
she
put
out
her
hand
neither
hot
nor
cold
but
of
a
dry
neutral
spiritual
temperature
and
pulled
alice
down
and
kissed
her
why
child
your
hand
like
ice
she
exclaimed
without
preamble
we
used
to
say
that
came
from
a
warm
i
guess
it
comes
from
a
cold
grapery
in
this
case
mother
said
dan
with
his
laugh
i
just
been
running
alice
through
it
and
perhaps
a
little
excitement
excitement
echoed
his
mother
cold
grapery
i
dare
say
and
very
silly
of
you
dan
but
there
no
occasion
for
excitement
as
if
we
were
strangers
sit
down
in
that
chair
my
dear
and
dan
you
go
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
i
want
alice
all
to
myself
i
saw
your
photograph
a
week
ago
and
i
thought
about
you
for
ages
since
and
wondered
whether
you
would
approve
of
your
old
oh
yes
whispered
the
girl
suppressing
a
tremor
and
dan
eyes
were
suffused
with
grateful
tears
at
his
mother
graciousness
alice
reticence
seemed
to
please
the
invalid
i
hope
you
like
all
your
old
friends
here
you
begun
with
the
worst
among
us
but
perhaps
you
like
him
the
best
because
he
is
the
worst
i
you
may
believe
just
half
of
that
alice
cried
dan
then
believe
the
best
half
or
the
half
you
like
best
said
mavering
there
must
be
something
good
in
him
if
you
like
him
have
they
welcomed
you
home
my
dear
we
all
made
a
stagger
at
it
said
dan
while
alice
was
faltering
over
the
words
which
were
so
slow
to
come
do
try
to
answer
my
formal
stupidities
you
are
welcome
and
enough
and
more
than
enough
of
speeches
did
you
have
a
comfortable
journey
up
oh
was
it
cold
not
at
all
the
cars
were
very
have
you
had
any
snow
yet
at
boston
no
none
at
all
now
i
feel
that
we
talking
sense
i
hope
you
found
everything
in
your
room
i
ca
look
after
things
as
i
would
like
and
so
i
there
everything
said
alice
we
very
i
very
glad
i
had
dan
look
he
my
housekeeper
he
understands
me
better
than
my
girls
he
like
me
more
that
what
makes
us
so
fond
of
each
other
it
a
kind
of
personal
vanity
but
he
has
his
good
points
dan
has
he
very
amiable
and
i
was
too
at
his
age
and
till
i
came
here
but
i
not
going
to
tell
you
of
his
good
points
i
dare
say
you
found
them
out
i
tell
you
about
his
bad
ones
he
says
you
very
serious
are
you
she
pressed
the
girl
hand
which
she
had
kept
in
hers
and
regarded
her
keenly
alice
dropped
her
eyes
at
the
odd
question
i
do
know
she
faltered
well
that
good
dan
oh
sometimes
only
sometimes
he
interposed
he
frivolous
and
he
very
but
he
none
the
worse
for
oh
thank
you
said
dan
and
alice
still
puzzled
laughed
provisionally
no
i
want
you
to
understand
that
he
too
and
a
great
thing
in
this
world
if
you
serious
you
be
apt
to
be
heavyhearted
and
then
you
find
dan
of
use
and
i
hope
he
know
how
to
turn
your
seriousness
to
account
too
he
needs
something
to
keep
him
down
to
keep
him
from
blowing
away
yes
it
very
well
for
people
to
be
opposites
only
they
must
understand
each
other
if
they
do
that
then
they
get
along
or
comes
to
the
same
thing
if
they
know
how
to
use
it
for
each
other
you
see
got
to
be
a
great
philosopher
lying
here
nobody
dares
contradict
me
or
interrupt
me
when
i
constructing
my
theories
and
so
i
get
them
i
wish
i
could
hear
them
all
said
alice
with
sincerity
that
made
mavering
laugh
as
as
dan
himself
and
that
seemed
to
suggest
the
nest
thing
to
her
you
can
for
the
asking
almost
any
time
are
you
a
very
truthful
person
my
dear
do
take
the
trouble
to
deny
it
if
you
are
she
added
at
alice
stare
you
see
i
not
at
all
conventional
and
you
need
be
come
tell
the
truth
for
once
at
any
rate
are
you
habitually
truthful
yes
i
think
i
am
said
alice
still
staring
dan
not
said
his
mother
quietly
oh
see
here
now
mother
do
give
me
away
he
tell
the
truth
in
extremity
of
course
and
he
tell
it
if
pleasant
always
but
if
you
do
expect
much
more
of
him
you
wo
be
disappointed
and
you
can
make
him
of
great
you
see
where
i
got
it
anyway
alice
said
dan
laughing
across
the
bed
at
her
yes
you
got
it
from
me
i
own
it
a
great
part
of
my
life
was
made
up
of
making
life
pleasant
to
others
by
fibbing
i
stopped
it
when
i
came
oh
not
altogether
mother
urged
her
son
you
must
be
too
hard
on
she
ignored
his
interruption
you
find
dan
a
great
convenience
with
that
agreeable
habit
of
his
you
can
get
him
to
make
all
your
verbal
excuses
for
you
he
do
it
beautifully
and
dictate
all
the
thousand
and
one
little
lying
notes
you
have
to
write
he
wo
mind
it
in
the
least
and
it
will
save
you
a
great
of
go
on
mother
go
on
said
dan
with
delighted
eyes
that
asked
of
alice
if
it
were
not
all
perfectly
charming
and
you
can
come
in
with
your
habitual
truthfulness
where
dan
know
what
to
do
poor
fellow
you
have
the
moral
courage
to
come
right
to
the
point
when
he
would
like
to
shillyshally
and
you
can
be
frank
while
he
trying
to
think
how
to
make
spell
any
other
little
compliments
mother
suggested
dan
no
said
mavering
that
all
i
thought
i
better
have
it
off
my
mind
i
knew
you
never
get
it
off
yours
and
alice
had
better
know
the
worst
it
is
the
worst
my
dear
and
if
i
talked
of
him
till
doomsday
i
could
say
any
more
harm
of
him
i
need
tell
you
how
sweet
he
is
you
know
that
i
sure
but
you
ca
know
yet
how
gentle
and
forbearing
he
is
how
patient
how
full
of
kindness
to
every
living
soul
how
unselfish
how
she
lost
her
voice
oh
come
now
mother
dan
protested
huskily
alice
did
not
say
anything
she
bent
over
without
repugnance
and
gathered
the
shadowy
shape
into
her
strong
young
arms
and
kissed
the
wasted
face
whose
unearthly
coolness
was
like
the
leaf
of
a
flower
against
her
lips
he
never
gave
me
a
moment
trouble
said
the
mother
and
i
sure
he
make
you
happy
how
kind
of
you
not
to
be
afraid
of
me
afraid
cried
the
girl
with
passionate
solemnity
i
shall
never
feel
safe
away
from
you
the
door
opened
upon
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
others
came
in
pasmer
did
not
wait
for
an
introduction
but
with
an
affectation
of
impulse
which
she
felt
mavering
would
penetrate
and
respect
she
went
up
to
the
bed
and
presented
herself
dan
mother
smiled
hospitably
upon
her
and
they
had
some
playful
words
about
their
children
pasmer
neatly
conveyed
the
regrets
of
her
husband
who
had
hoped
up
to
the
last
moment
that
the
heavy
cold
he
had
taken
would
let
him
come
with
her
and
the
invalid
made
her
guest
sit
down
on
the
right
hand
of
her
bed
which
seemed
to
be
the
place
of
honour
while
her
husband
took
dan
place
on
the
left
and
admired
his
wife
skill
in
fence
at
the
end
of
her
encounter
with
pasmer
she
called
out
with
her
strong
voice
why
do
you
get
your
banjo
molly
and
play
something
a
banjo
oh
do
cried
pasmer
it
so
picturesque
and
interesting
i
heard
that
young
ladies
had
taken
it
up
and
i
should
so
like
to
hear
it
she
had
turned
to
mavering
again
and
she
now
beamed
winningly
upon
her
alice
regarded
the
girl
with
a
puzzled
frown
as
she
brought
her
banjo
in
from
another
room
and
sat
down
with
it
she
relaxed
the
severity
of
her
stare
a
little
as
molly
played
one
wild
air
after
another
singing
some
of
them
with
an
evidence
of
training
in
her
naive
effectiveness
there
were
some
mexican
songs
which
she
had
learned
in
a
late
visit
to
their
country
and
some
creole
melodies
caught
up
in
a
winter
sojourn
to
louisiana
the
elder
sister
accompanied
her
on
the
piano
not
with
the
hard
resolute
proficiency
which
one
might
have
expected
of
eunice
mavering
but
with
a
sympathy
which
was
perhaps
the
expression
of
her
share
of
the
family
kindliness
your
children
seem
to
have
been
everywhere
said
pasmer
with
a
sigh
of
flattering
envy
oh
you
not
going
to
stop
she
pleaded
turning
from
mavering
to
molly
i
think
dan
had
better
do
the
rheumatic
uncle
now
said
eunice
from
the
piano
oh
yes
the
rheumatic
uncle
do
said
pasmer
we
know
the
rheumatic
uncle
she
added
with
a
glance
at
alice
dan
looked
at
her
too
as
if
doubtful
of
her
approval
and
then
he
told
in
character
a
yankee
story
which
he
had
worked
up
from
the
talk
of
his
friend
the
foreman
it
made
them
all
laugh
pasmer
was
the
gayest
she
let
herself
go
and
throughout
the
evening
she
flattered
right
and
left
and
said
in
her
to
mavering
that
she
had
never
imagined
so
delightful
a
time
o
mavering
i
do
wonder
your
children
love
their
home
it
a
xxxiv
she
a
cat
dan
said
his
mother
quietly
and
not
without
liking
when
he
looked
in
for
his
goodnight
kiss
after
the
rest
were
gone
a
perfect
tabby
but
your
alice
is
o
mother
she
a
little
too
sublime
for
me
but
you
young
and
you
can
stand
dan
laughed
with
delight
yes
i
think
i
can
mother
all
i
ask
is
the
oh
you
very
much
in
love
both
of
you
there
no
doubt
about
that
what
i
mean
is
that
she
very
high
strung
very
intense
she
has
ideals
any
one
can
see
dan
took
it
all
for
praise
yes
he
said
eagerly
that
what
i
told
you
and
that
will
be
the
best
thing
about
it
for
me
i
have
no
well
you
must
find
out
what
hers
are
and
live
up
to
oh
there
wo
be
any
trouble
about
that
said
dan
buoyantly
you
must
help
her
to
find
them
out
he
looked
puzzled
you
must
expect
the
child
to
be
too
definite
at
first
nor
to
be
always
right
even
when
she
full
of
ideals
you
must
be
very
patient
with
her
oh
i
will
mother
you
know
that
how
could
i
ever
be
impatient
with
alice
very
forbearing
and
very
kind
and
indefatigably
forgiving
ask
your
father
how
to
dan
promised
to
do
so
with
a
laugh
at
the
joke
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
father
was
particularly
exemplary
in
these
things
or
that
his
mother
idolised
him
for
what
seemed
to
dan
simply
a
endurance
of
her
sick
whims
and
freaks
and
moods
he
broke
forth
into
a
vehement
protest
of
his
good
intentions
to
which
his
mother
did
not
seem
very
attentive
after
a
while
she
asked
is
she
always
so
silent
dan
well
not
with
me
mother
of
course
she
was
a
little
embarrassed
she
did
know
exactly
what
to
say
i
suppose
oh
i
rather
liked
that
at
least
she
is
a
and
we
shall
get
acquainted
we
shall
like
each
other
she
will
understand
me
when
you
bring
her
home
here
to
live
with
us
and
yes
said
dan
rising
rather
hastily
and
stooping
over
to
his
mother
i
not
going
to
let
you
talk
any
more
now
or
we
shall
have
to
suffer
for
it
he
got
gaily
away
before
his
mother
could
amplify
a
suggestion
which
spoiled
a
little
of
his
pleasure
in
the
praises
he
thought
they
were
unqualified
and
enthusiastic
praises
she
had
been
heaping
upon
alice
he
wished
to
go
to
bed
with
them
all
sweet
and
unalloyed
in
his
thought
to
sleep
to
dream
upon
his
perfect
triumph
pasmer
was
a
long
time
in
undressing
and
in
calming
down
after
the
demands
which
the
different
events
of
the
evening
had
made
upon
her
resources
it
has
certainly
been
a
very
mixed
evening
alice
she
said
as
she
took
the
pins
out
of
her
back
hair
and
let
it
fall
and
she
continued
to
talk
as
she
went
back
and
forth
between
their
rooms
what
do
you
think
of
for
young
ladies
is
it
rather
rowdy
decidedly
rowdy
i
think
and
dan
yankee
story
i
expected
to
see
the
old
gentleman
get
up
and
perform
some
i
suppose
they
do
it
to
amuse
mavering
said
alice
with
cold
displeasure
oh
it
quite
right
tittered
pasmer
it
would
be
as
much
as
their
lives
are
worth
if
they
did
you
can
see
that
she
rules
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
what
a
will
i
glad
you
not
going
to
come
under
her
sway
i
really
think
you
could
be
safe
from
her
in
the
same
hemisphere
it
well
you
going
abroad
at
once
they
a
very
family
do
you
think
very
of
course
that
the
danger
of
living
off
by
themselves
as
they
do
they
get
to
thinking
there
nobody
else
in
the
world
you
would
simply
be
absorbed
by
them
it
a
escape
how
splendidly
dan
contrasts
with
the
others
oh
he
delightful
he
a
man
of
the
world
give
me
the
world
after
all
and
he
so
considerate
of
their
rustic
conceit
what
a
house
it
perfectly
baronial
and
ridiculous
in
any
other
country
it
would
mean
something
society
entertainments
troops
of
guests
but
here
it
does
mean
anything
but
money
not
that
money
is
a
very
good
thing
i
wish
we
had
more
of
it
but
now
you
see
how
very
little
it
can
do
by
itself
you
looked
very
well
alice
and
behaved
with
great
dignity
perhaps
too
much
you
ought
to
enter
a
little
more
into
the
spirit
of
things
even
if
you
do
respect
them
that
oldest
girl
particularly
pleased
i
fancy
though
it
does
matter
alice
replied
to
her
mother
from
time
to
time
with
absent
yeses
and
noes
she
sat
by
the
window
looking
out
on
the
hillside
lawn
before
the
house
the
moon
had
risen
and
poured
a
flood
of
snowy
light
over
it
in
which
the
cold
statues
dimly
shone
and
the
firs
in
clumps
and
singly
blackened
with
an
inky
solidity
beyond
wandered
the
hills
their
bare
pasturage
broken
here
and
there
by
blotches
of
woodland
after
her
mother
had
gone
to
bed
she
turned
her
light
down
and
resumed
her
seat
by
the
window
pressing
her
hot
forehead
against
the
pane
and
losing
all
sense
of
the
scene
without
in
the
whirl
of
her
thoughts
after
this
evening
of
gay
welcome
in
dan
family
and
those
moments
of
tenderness
with
him
her
heart
was
troubled
she
now
realised
her
engagement
as
something
exterior
to
herself
and
her
own
family
and
confronted
for
the
first
time
its
responsibilities
its
ties
and
its
claims
it
was
not
enough
to
be
everything
to
dan
she
could
not
be
that
unless
she
were
something
to
his
family
she
did
not
realise
this
vividly
but
with
the
remoteness
which
all
verities
except
those
of
sensation
have
for
youth
her
uneasiness
was
full
of
exultation
of
triumph
she
knew
she
had
been
admired
by
dan
family
and
she
experienced
the
sweetness
of
having
pleased
them
for
his
sake
his
happy
eyes
shone
before
her
but
she
was
touched
in
her
by
what
her
mother
had
coarsely
characterised
in
them
they
had
regarded
her
liking
them
as
a
matter
of
course
his
mother
had
ignored
her
even
in
pretending
to
decry
dan
to
her
but
again
this
was
very
remote
very
momentary
it
was
no
nearer
no
more
lasting
on
the
surface
of
her
happiness
than
the
flying
whiff
of
thin
cloud
that
chased
across
the
moon
and
lost
themselves
in
the
vast
blue
around
it
xxxv
people
came
to
the
first
of
james
bellingham
receptions
with
the
expectation
of
pleasure
which
the
earlier
receptions
of
the
season
awaken
even
in
the
oldest
and
wisest
but
they
tried
to
dissemble
their
eagerness
in
a
fashionable
tardiness
we
get
later
and
later
said
brinkley
to
john
munt
as
she
sat
watching
the
slow
gathering
of
the
crowd
by
eleven
it
had
not
yet
hidden
bellingham
where
she
stood
near
the
middle
of
the
room
from
the
pleasant
corner
they
had
found
after
accidentally
arriving
together
brinkley
had
not
come
he
said
he
might
not
be
too
old
for
receptions
but
he
was
too
good
in
either
case
he
preferred
to
stay
at
home
we
used
to
come
at
nine
and
now
we
come
at
i
getting
into
a
quotation
from
mother
goose
i
i
thought
it
was
browning
said
munt
with
his
witticism
manner
neither
he
nor
brinkley
was
particularly
glad
to
be
together
but
at
james
bellingham
it
was
well
not
to
fling
any
companionship
away
till
you
were
sure
of
something
else
besides
brinkley
was
indolent
and
and
munt
was
active
and
and
they
were
well
fitted
to
get
on
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
while
they
talked
she
kept
an
eye
out
for
other
acquaintance
and
he
stood
alert
to
escape
at
the
first
chance
how
is
it
we
are
here
so
early
or
rather
you
are
she
pursued
irrelevantly
oh
i
do
know
said
munt
accepting
the
implication
of
his
superior
fashion
with
pleasure
i
never
mind
being
among
the
first
it
rather
interesting
to
see
people
come
in
do
you
think
that
depends
a
good
deal
on
the
people
i
do
find
a
great
variety
in
their
smirks
and
smiles
to
bellingham
i
seem
to
be
doing
them
all
myself
and
there
a
monotony
about
their
apprehension
and
helplessness
when
they
turned
adrift
that
altogether
too
much
like
my
own
no
munt
i
ca
agree
with
you
that
it
interesting
to
see
people
come
in
it
altogether
too
autobiographical
what
else
have
you
to
suggest
i
afraid
i
at
the
end
of
my
string
said
munt
i
suppose
we
shall
see
the
pasmers
and
young
mavering
here
brinkley
turned
and
looked
sharply
at
him
you
heard
of
the
engagement
he
asked
no
decidedly
i
have
and
after
his
flight
from
campobello
it
the
last
thing
i
expected
to
hear
of
when
did
it
come
out
only
within
a
few
days
they
been
keeping
it
rather
quiet
pasmer
told
me
brinkley
gave
herself
a
moment
for
reflection
well
if
he
can
stand
it
i
suppose
i
that
is
exactly
what
people
are
saying
to
pasmer
brinkley
suggested
munt
with
his
humorous
manner
i
dare
say
they
trying
to
make
her
believe
that
her
daughter
is
sacrificed
that
the
way
but
she
knows
there
no
doubt
but
she
informed
herself
she
put
me
through
my
catechism
about
the
maverings
the
day
of
the
picnic
down
do
you
know
them
bridge
mavering
and
i
were
at
harvard
tell
me
about
brinkley
listened
to
munt
praises
of
his
old
friend
with
an
attention
superficially
divided
with
the
people
to
whom
she
bowed
and
smiled
the
room
was
filling
up
well
she
said
at
the
end
he
a
sweet
young
fellow
i
hope
he
likes
his
i
guess
there
no
doubt
about
his
liking
one
of
them
the
principal
yes
if
she
is
the
principal
there
was
an
implication
in
everything
she
said
that
dan
mavering
had
been
hoodwinked
by
pasmer
mature
ladies
always
like
to
imply
something
of
the
sort
in
these
cases
they
like
to
ignore
the
prime
agency
of
youth
and
love
and
pretend
that
marriage
is
a
game
that
parents
play
at
with
us
as
if
we
were
in
an
old
comedy
it
is
a
tradition
will
he
take
her
home
to
live
no
i
heard
that
they
all
going
abroad
for
a
year
or
two
at
ah
i
thought
so
cried
brinkley
she
looked
up
with
whimsical
pleasure
in
the
uncertainty
of
an
old
gentleman
who
is
staring
hard
at
her
through
his
glasses
well
she
said
with
a
pleasant
sharpness
do
you
make
me
out
as
nearly
as
my
belief
in
your
wisdom
will
allow
said
the
old
gentleman
as
distinctly
as
his
long
white
moustache
and
an
apparent
absence
of
teeth
behind
it
would
let
him
john
munt
had
eagerly
abandoned
the
seat
he
was
keeping
at
brinkley
side
and
had
launched
himself
into
the
thickening
crowd
the
old
gentleman
who
was
lank
and
tall
folded
himself
down
into
it
he
continued
as
tranquilly
as
if
seated
quite
alone
with
brinkley
and
not
minding
that
his
voice
with
the
senile
crow
in
it
made
itself
heard
by
others
always
surprised
to
find
sensible
people
at
these
things
of
jane
they
most
extraordinary
things
jane
idea
of
society
is
to
turn
a
herd
of
human
beings
loose
in
her
house
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
she
has
no
more
sense
of
hospitality
or
responsibility
than
the
elements
or
divine
providence
you
may
come
here
and
have
a
good
time
if
you
can
get
it
she
wo
object
or
you
may
die
of
solitude
and
inanition
she
never
know
it
i
do
know
but
it
rather
sublime
in
her
like
the
indifference
of
fate
but
it
rather
rough
on
those
who
understand
it
she
likes
to
see
her
rooms
filled
with
pretty
dresses
but
she
has
no
social
instincts
and
no
social
inspiration
whatever
she
lights
and
heats
and
feeds
her
guests
and
then
she
leaves
them
to
themselves
she
a
kind
woman
jane
is
a
very
woman
and
i
really
think
she
be
grieved
if
she
thought
any
one
went
away
unhappy
but
she
does
nothing
to
make
them
at
home
in
her
house
absolutely
perhaps
she
does
all
they
deserve
for
them
i
do
know
that
any
one
acquires
merit
by
coming
to
an
evening
party
and
it
impossible
to
be
personally
hospitable
to
everybody
in
such
a
yes
i
sometimes
taken
that
view
of
it
and
yet
if
you
ask
a
stranger
to
your
house
you
establish
a
tacit
understanding
with
him
that
you
wo
forget
him
after
you
have
him
there
i
like
to
go
about
and
note
the
mystification
of
strangers
who
come
here
with
some
notion
of
a
little
attention
it
delightfully
poignant
i
suffer
with
them
it
a
cheap
luxury
of
woe
i
follow
them
through
all
the
turns
and
windings
of
their
experience
of
course
the
theory
is
that
being
turned
loose
here
with
the
rest
they
may
speak
to
anybody
but
the
fact
is
they
ca
sometimes
i
should
like
to
hail
some
of
these
unfriended
spirits
but
i
have
the
courage
i
not
individually
bashful
but
i
have
a
thousand
years
of
civilisation
behind
me
there
ought
to
be
policemen
to
show
strangers
about
and
be
kind
to
them
i
just
seen
two
pretty
women
cast
away
in
a
corner
and
clinging
to
a
small
on
the
wall
with
a
show
of
interest
that
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
why
do
you
come
brinkley
i
should
like
to
know
not
obliged
no
said
brinkley
lowering
her
voice
instinctively
as
if
to
bring
his
down
i
suppose
i
come
from
force
of
habit
i
been
coming
a
long
time
you
know
why
do
you
come
because
i
ca
sleep
if
i
could
sleep
i
should
be
at
home
in
a
weariness
came
into
his
thin
face
and
dim
eyes
that
was
pathetic
and
passed
into
a
whimsical
sarcasm
i
not
one
of
the
great
leisure
class
you
know
that
voluntarily
turns
night
into
day
do
you
know
what
i
go
about
saying
now
something
amusing
i
you
better
not
be
so
sure
of
that
i
discovered
a
fact
or
rather
i
formulated
an
old
one
i
always
been
troubled
how
to
classify
people
here
there
are
so
many
exceptions
and
i
ended
by
broadly
generalising
them
as
women
and
brinkley
was
certainly
amused
at
this
it
seems
to
me
that
there
you
been
anticipated
by
nature
not
to
mention
oh
not
in
my
particular
view
the
women
in
america
represent
the
aristocracy
which
exists
everywhere
else
in
both
sexes
you
are
born
to
the
patrician
leisure
you
have
the
accomplishments
and
the
clothes
and
manners
and
ideals
and
we
men
are
a
natural
commonalty
born
to
business
to
newspapers
to
cigars
and
horses
this
natural
female
aristocracy
of
ours
establishes
the
forms
usages
places
and
times
of
society
the
epicene
aristocracies
of
other
countries
turn
night
into
day
in
their
social
pleasures
and
our
noblesse
sympathetically
follows
their
example
you
ladies
who
can
lie
till
noon
next
day
come
to
jane
reception
at
eleven
and
you
drag
along
with
you
a
herd
of
us
brokers
bankers
merchants
lawyers
and
doctors
who
must
be
at
our
offices
and
before
nine
in
the
morning
the
hours
of
us
are
regulated
by
the
wholesome
industries
of
the
great
democracy
which
we
a
part
of
and
the
hours
of
our
wives
and
daughters
by
the
deleterious
pleasures
of
the
old
world
aristocracy
that
the
reason
we
not
all
at
home
in
i
thought
you
were
not
at
home
in
bed
because
you
could
i
know
it
and
you
no
idea
how
horrible
a
bed
is
that
you
sleep
the
old
man
voice
broke
in
a
tremor
ah
it
a
bed
of
torture
i
spend
many
a
wicked
hour
in
mine
envying
lawrence
his
gridiron
but
what
do
you
think
of
my
theory
it
a
very
pretty
theory
my
only
objection
to
it
is
that
it
too
flattering
you
know
i
rather
prefer
to
abuse
my
sex
and
to
be
set
up
as
a
natural
aristocracy
i
do
know
that
i
can
quite
agree
to
that
even
to
account
satisfactorily
for
being
at
your
you
too
modest
no
really
there
ought
to
be
some
men
among
us
men
without
morrows
now
why
do
you
and
my
husband
set
an
example
to
your
sex
why
you
relax
your
severe
sense
of
duty
why
need
you
insist
upon
being
at
your
offices
every
morning
at
nine
why
do
you
fling
off
these
habits
of
lifelong
industry
and
be
gracefully
indolent
in
the
interest
of
the
higher
civilisation
bromfield
corey
looked
round
at
her
with
a
smile
of
relish
for
her
satire
her
husband
was
a
notoriously
lazy
man
who
had
chosen
to
live
restrictedly
upon
an
inherited
property
rather
than
increase
it
by
the
smallest
exertion
do
you
think
we
could
get
andy
pasmer
to
join
us
no
i
ca
encourage
you
with
that
idea
you
must
get
on
without
pasmer
he
going
back
to
europe
with
his
do
you
mean
that
their
girl
married
it
just
well
i
must
say
pasmer
has
made
use
of
her
he
too
liked
to
imply
that
it
was
all
an
effect
of
her
manoeuvring
and
that
the
young
people
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
survival
from
european
fiction
dies
hard
who
is
the
young
man
brinkley
gave
him
an
account
of
dan
mavering
as
she
had
seen
him
at
campobello
and
of
his
family
as
she
just
heard
of
them
mr
munt
was
telling
me
about
them
as
you
came
why
was
that
john
munt
yes
did
you
know
him
no
said
corey
sadly
i
do
know
anybody
nowadays
i
seem
to
be
going
to
pieces
every
way
i
do
call
such
a
very
great
not
at
all
cried
brinkley
i
myself
and
brinkley
but
i
feel
a
thousand
years
old
i
do
see
people
and
when
i
do
i
do
know
my
head
in
a
he
let
it
hang
heavily
then
he
lifted
it
and
said
he
a
nice
comfortable
fellow
munt
is
why
did
he
stop
and
talk
a
bit
well
munt
modest
you
know
and
i
suppose
he
thought
he
might
be
the
third
that
makes
company
a
crowd
besides
nobody
stops
and
talks
a
bit
at
these
things
they
afraid
of
boring
or
being
yes
they
all
in
as
unnatural
a
mood
as
if
they
were
posing
for
a
photograph
i
wonder
who
invented
this
sort
of
thing
do
you
know
said
the
old
man
that
i
think
it
rather
worse
with
us
than
with
any
other
people
we
a
simple
sincere
folk
domestic
in
our
instincts
not
gregarious
or
frivolous
in
any
way
and
when
we
wrenched
away
from
our
firesides
and
packed
in
our
best
clothes
into
jane
gilded
saloons
we
feel
vindictive
we
feel
wicked
when
the
boston
being
abandons
himself
or
herself
to
fashion
she
suffers
a
depravation
into
something
quite
lurid
she
has
a
bad
conscience
and
she
hardens
her
heart
with
talk
that
tremendously
cynical
it
amusing
said
corey
staring
round
him
purblindly
at
the
groups
and
files
of
people
surging
and
eddying
past
the
corner
where
he
sat
with
brinkley
no
it
shocking
said
his
companion
at
any
rate
you
must
say
such
things
even
if
you
think
them
i
ca
let
you
go
too
far
you
know
these
young
people
think
it
heavenly
she
took
with
him
the
tone
that
elderly
people
use
with
those
older
than
themselves
who
have
begun
to
break
there
were
authority
and
patronage
in
it
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
thought
that
bromfield
corey
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
come
but
she
determined
to
keep
him
safe
and
harmless
as
far
as
she
could
from
time
to
time
the
crowd
was
a
stationary
mass
in
front
of
them
then
it
dissolved
and
flowed
away
to
gather
anew
there
were
moments
when
the
floor
near
them
was
quite
vacant
then
it
was
inundated
again
with
silken
trains
from
another
part
of
the
house
came
the
sound
of
music
and
most
of
the
young
people
who
passed
went
two
and
two
as
if
they
were
partners
in
the
dance
and
had
come
out
of
the
between
dances
there
was
a
good
deal
of
nervous
talk
politely
subdued
among
them
but
it
was
not
the
note
of
unearthly
rapture
which
conventional
claim
had
implied
it
was
eager
anxious
and
was
probably
not
different
from
the
voice
of
good
society
anywhere
xxxvi
why
there
dan
mavering
now
said
brinkley
rather
to
herself
than
to
her
companion
and
alone
dan
face
showed
above
most
of
the
heads
and
shoulders
about
him
it
was
flushed
and
looked
troubled
and
excited
he
caught
sight
of
brinkley
and
his
eyes
brightened
joyfully
he
slipped
quickly
through
the
crowd
and
bowed
over
her
hand
while
he
stammered
out
without
giving
her
a
chance
for
reply
till
the
end
o
brinkley
i
so
glad
to
see
you
i
going
i
want
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
you
brinkley
i
want
to
bring
i
want
to
introduce
some
friends
of
mine
to
you
some
ladies
brinkley
very
nice
people
i
met
last
summer
at
portland
their
father
general
wrayne
has
been
building
some
railroads
down
east
and
they
very
nice
people
but
they
do
know
any
one
any
ladies
and
they
been
looking
at
the
pictures
ever
since
they
came
they
very
good
pictures
but
it
is
an
exhibition
he
broke
down
with
a
laugh
why
of
course
mavering
i
shall
be
delighted
said
brinkley
with
a
hospitality
rendered
reckless
by
her
sympathy
with
the
young
fellow
by
all
means
oh
thanks
thank
you
aver
so
much
said
dan
i
bring
them
to
you
they
understand
he
slipped
into
the
crowd
again
corey
made
an
offer
of
going
brinkley
stopped
him
with
her
fan
no
stay
corey
unless
you
wish
to
go
i
fancy
it
the
people
you
were
talking
about
and
you
must
help
me
through
with
i
ask
nothing
better
said
the
old
man
unresentful
of
dan
having
not
even
seemed
to
see
him
in
his
generous
preoccupation
i
should
like
to
see
how
you
get
on
and
perhaps
i
can
be
of
of
course
you
can
the
but
why
has
he
introduced
them
to
his
pasmers
what
eh
oh
corey
made
these
utterances
in
response
to
a
sharper
pressure
of
brinkley
fan
on
his
arm
dan
was
opening
a
way
through
the
crowd
before
them
for
two
ladies
whom
he
now
introduced
mrs
frobisher
brinkley
and
miss
brinkley
cordially
gave
her
hand
to
the
ladies
and
said
may
i
introduce
corey
mavering
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
old
man
rose
and
stood
with
the
little
group
dan
face
shone
with
flattered
pride
and
joyous
triumph
he
bubbled
out
some
happy
incoherencies
about
the
honour
and
pleasure
while
at
the
same
time
he
beamed
with
tender
gratitude
upon
brinkley
who
was
behaving
with
a
gracious
humorous
kindliness
to
the
aliens
cast
upon
her
mercies
frobisher
after
a
of
boston
society
was
not
that
presence
of
easy
gaiety
which
crossed
dan
path
on
the
portland
pavement
the
morning
of
his
arrival
from
campobello
but
she
was
still
a
handsome
effective
woman
of
whom
you
would
have
hesitated
to
say
whether
she
was
showy
or
distinguished
perhaps
she
was
a
little
of
both
with
an
air
of
command
bred
of
supremacy
in
frontier
garrisons
her
sister
was
like
her
in
the
way
that
a
young
girl
may
be
like
a
young
matron
they
blossomed
alike
in
the
genial
atmosphere
of
brinkley
and
of
corey
he
began
at
once
to
make
bantering
speeches
with
them
both
the
friendliness
of
an
old
man
and
a
stout
elderly
woman
might
not
have
been
their
ideal
of
success
at
an
evening
party
used
as
they
were
to
the
unstinted
homage
of
young
captains
and
lieutenants
but
a
brief
experience
of
bellingham
hospitality
must
have
taught
them
humility
and
when
a
stout
elderly
gentleman
whose
baldness
was
still
trying
to
be
blond
joined
the
group
the
spectacle
was
not
without
its
points
of
resemblance
to
a
social
ovation
perhaps
it
was
a
boston
social
ovation
hallo
corey
said
this
stout
gentleman
whom
brinkley
at
once
introduced
as
bellingham
and
whose
salutation
corey
returned
with
hallo
charles
of
equal
intimacy
bellingham
caught
at
the
name
of
frobisher
mrs
major
dick
frobisher
mrs
colonel
now
but
dick
always
said
the
lady
with
immediate
comradery
do
you
know
my
husband
i
should
think
so
said
bellingham
and
a
talk
of
common
interest
and
mutual
reminiscence
sprang
up
between
them
bellingham
graphically
depicted
his
meeting
with
colonel
frobisher
the
last
time
he
was
out
on
the
plains
and
frobisher
and
miss
wrayne
discovered
to
their
great
satisfaction
that
he
was
the
brother
of
stephen
blake
of
omaba
who
had
come
out
to
the
fort
once
with
her
husband
and
captured
the
garrison
as
they
said
frobisher
accounted
for
her
present
separation
from
her
husband
and
said
she
had
come
on
for
a
while
to
be
with
her
father
and
sister
who
both
needed
more
looking
after
than
the
indians
her
father
had
left
the
army
and
was
building
railroads
miss
wrayne
when
she
was
not
appealed
to
for
confirmation
or
recollection
by
her
sister
was
having
a
lively
talk
with
corey
and
brinkley
she
seemed
to
enter
into
their
humour
and
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
dan
mavering
he
hung
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
little
group
proffering
unrequited
sympathy
and
applause
and
at
last
he
murmured
something
about
having
to
go
back
to
some
friends
and
took
himself
off
frobisher
and
miss
wrayne
let
him
go
with
a
certain
shade
the
lightest
and
yet
evident
of
not
wholly
satisfied
pique
women
know
how
to
accept
a
reparation
on
account
and
without
giving
a
receipt
in
full
brinkley
gave
him
her
hand
with
an
effect
of
compassionate
intelligence
and
appreciation
of
the
sacrifice
he
must
have
made
in
leaving
alice
may
i
congratulate
you
she
murmured
oh
yes
indeed
thank
you
brinkley
he
gushed
tremulously
and
he
pressed
her
hand
hard
and
clung
to
it
as
if
he
would
like
to
take
her
with
him
neither
of
the
older
men
noticed
his
going
they
were
both
taken
in
their
elderly
way
with
these
two
handsome
young
women
and
they
professed
regret
bellingham
that
his
mother
was
not
there
and
corey
that
neither
his
wife
nor
daughters
had
come
whom
they
might
otherwise
have
introduced
they
did
not
offer
to
share
their
acquaintance
with
any
one
else
but
they
made
the
most
of
it
themselves
as
if
knowing
a
good
thing
when
they
had
it
their
devotion
to
frobisher
and
her
sister
heightened
the
curiosity
of
such
people
as
noticed
it
but
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
it
moved
any
in
that
company
with
a
strong
wish
to
know
the
ladies
the
time
comes
to
every
man
no
matter
how
great
a
power
he
may
be
in
society
when
the
general
social
opinion
retires
him
for
senility
and
this
time
had
come
for
bromfield
corey
he
could
no
longer
make
or
mar
any
success
and
charles
bellingham
was
so
notoriously
amiable
so
deeply
compromised
by
his
inveterate
habit
of
liking
nearly
every
one
that
his
notice
could
not
distinguish
or
advantage
a
newcomer
he
and
corey
took
the
ladies
down
to
supper
brinkley
saw
them
there
together
and
a
little
later
she
saw
old
corey
wander
off
forgetful
of
miss
wrayne
she
saw
dan
mavering
but
not
the
pasmers
and
then
when
corey
forgot
miss
wrayne
she
saw
dan
forlorn
and
bewildered
looking
approach
the
girl
and
offer
her
his
arm
for
the
return
to
the
she
took
it
with
a
bright
cold
smile
making
white
rings
of
ironical
deprecation
around
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
what
is
that
poor
boy
doing
i
wonder
said
brinkley
to
herself
xxxvii
the
next
morning
dan
mavering
knocked
at
boardman
door
before
the
reporter
was
up
this
might
have
been
any
time
before
one
but
it
was
really
at
nine
boardman
wanted
to
know
who
was
there
and
when
mavering
had
said
it
was
he
boardman
seemed
to
ponder
the
fact
awhile
before
mavering
heard
him
getting
out
of
bed
and
coming
barefooted
to
the
door
he
unlocked
it
and
got
back
into
bed
then
he
called
out
come
in
and
mavering
pushed
the
door
open
impatiently
but
he
stood
blank
and
silent
looking
helplessly
at
his
friend
a
strong
glare
of
winter
light
came
in
through
the
naked
sash
for
boardman
apparently
not
only
did
not
close
his
but
did
not
pull
down
his
curtains
when
he
went
to
bed
and
shone
upon
his
gay
shrewd
face
where
he
lay
showing
his
teeth
in
a
smile
at
mavering
prefer
to
stand
he
asked
by
and
by
after
mavering
had
remained
standing
in
silence
with
no
signs
of
proposing
to
sit
down
or
speak
mavering
glanced
at
the
only
chair
in
the
room
boardman
clothes
dripped
and
dangled
over
it
throw
on
the
bed
he
said
following
mavering
glance
i
take
the
bed
myself
said
mavering
and
he
sat
down
on
the
side
of
it
and
was
again
suggestively
silent
boardman
moved
his
head
on
the
pillow
as
he
watched
mavering
face
with
the
agreeable
sense
of
personal
security
which
we
all
feel
in
viewing
trouble
from
the
outside
you
seem
balled
up
about
mavering
sighed
heavily
balled
up
it
no
word
for
it
boardman
i
done
for
yesterday
i
was
the
happiest
fellow
in
the
world
and
now
yes
it
all
over
with
me
and
it
my
own
fault
as
usual
look
at
that
he
jerked
boardman
a
note
which
he
had
been
holding
fast
in
his
band
and
got
up
and
went
to
look
himself
at
the
wide
range
of
and
slated
roofs
which
boardman
commanded
want
me
to
read
it
boardman
asked
and
mavering
nodded
without
glancing
round
it
dispersed
through
the
air
of
boardman
room
as
he
unfolded
it
a
thin
elect
perfume
like
a
feminine
presence
refined
and
strict
and
boardman
involuntarily
passed
his
hand
over
his
rumpled
hair
as
if
to
make
himself
a
little
more
personable
before
reading
the
letter
dear
mavering
i
enclose
the
ring
you
gave
me
the
other
day
and
i
release
you
from
the
promise
you
gave
with
it
i
am
convinced
that
you
wronged
yourself
in
offering
either
without
your
whole
heart
and
i
care
too
much
for
your
happiness
to
let
you
persist
in
your
sacrifice
in
begging
that
you
will
not
uselessly
attempt
to
see
me
but
that
you
will
consider
this
note
final
i
know
you
will
do
me
the
justice
not
to
attribute
an
ungenerous
motive
to
me
i
shall
rejoice
to
hear
of
any
good
that
may
befall
you
and
i
shall
try
not
to
envy
any
one
through
whom
it
yours
sincerely
alice
pasmer
i
say
nothing
of
circumstances
or
of
persons
i
feel
that
any
comment
of
mine
upon
them
would
be
mavering
looked
up
at
the
sound
boardman
made
in
refolding
the
letter
boardman
grinned
with
sparkling
eyes
pretty
neat
he
said
pretty
infernally
neat
roared
mavering
do
you
suppose
she
means
business
of
course
she
means
business
why
should
she
i
do
know
why
should
she
well
i
tell
you
boardman
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
if
i
going
to
get
any
good
out
of
you
but
it
a
he
came
away
from
the
window
and
swept
boardman
clothes
off
the
chair
preparatory
to
taking
it
boardman
lifted
his
head
nervously
from
the
pillow
oh
i
put
them
on
the
bed
if
you
so
punctilious
cried
mavering
i
do
mind
the
clothes
said
boardman
i
thought
i
heard
my
watch
knock
on
the
floor
in
my
vest
pocket
just
take
it
out
will
you
and
see
if
you
stopped
it
oh
confound
your
old
waterbury
all
the
world
stopped
why
your
watch
stop
too
mavering
tugged
it
out
of
the
pocket
and
then
shoved
it
back
disdainfully
you
could
stop
that
thing
with
anything
short
of
a
sledgehammer
it
rattling
away
like
a
you
know
those
portland
women
those
ladies
i
spent
the
day
with
when
you
were
down
there
at
the
regatta
the
day
i
came
from
campobello
frobisher
and
her
sister
he
agglutinated
one
query
to
another
till
he
saw
a
light
of
intelligence
dawn
in
boardman
eye
well
they
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
suppose
i
was
introduced
to
them
on
class
day
and
i
ought
to
have
shown
them
some
attention
there
but
the
moment
i
saw
alice
miss
pasmer
i
forgot
all
about
but
they
did
seem
to
have
noticed
it
much
and
i
made
it
all
right
with
that
day
at
portland
and
they
came
up
in
the
fall
and
i
made
an
appointment
with
them
to
drive
out
to
cambridge
and
show
them
the
place
they
were
to
take
me
up
at
the
art
museum
but
that
was
the
day
i
met
miss
pasmer
and
i
i
forgot
about
those
women
boardman
was
one
of
those
who
seldom
laugh
but
his
grin
expressed
all
the
malicious
enjoyment
he
felt
he
said
nothing
in
the
impressive
silence
which
mavering
let
follow
at
this
point
oh
you
think
it
was
funny
cried
mavering
i
thought
it
was
funny
too
but
alice
herself
opened
my
eyes
to
what
i
done
and
i
always
intended
to
make
it
all
right
with
them
when
i
got
the
chance
i
supposed
she
wished
me
boardman
grinned
afresh
she
told
me
i
must
though
she
seemed
to
dislike
my
having
been
with
them
the
day
after
she
thrown
me
over
but
if
mavering
interrupted
himself
to
say
as
the
grin
widened
on
boardman
face
if
you
think
it
was
any
case
of
vulgar
jealousy
you
very
much
mistaken
boardman
she
is
capable
of
it
and
she
was
so
magnanimous
about
it
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
all
i
could
to
retrieve
myself
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
her
well
last
night
at
jim
bellingham
reception
a
look
of
professional
interest
replaced
the
derision
in
eyes
any
particular
occasion
for
the
reception
given
in
honour
of
anybody
i
contribute
to
your
society
notes
some
other
time
boardman
said
mavering
haughtily
i
speaking
to
a
friend
not
an
interviewer
well
whom
should
i
see
after
the
first
waltz
i
been
dancing
with
alice
and
we
were
taking
a
turn
through
the
and
she
hanging
on
my
arm
and
i
knew
everybody
saw
how
it
was
and
i
was
feeling
well
whom
should
i
see
but
these
women
they
were
in
a
corner
by
themselves
looking
at
a
picture
and
trying
to
look
as
if
they
were
doing
it
voluntarily
but
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
they
know
anybody
and
i
knew
they
had
better
be
in
the
heart
of
the
sahara
without
acquaintances
than
where
they
were
and
when
they
bowed
forlornly
across
the
room
to
me
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
felt
so
sorry
for
them
and
i
told
alice
who
they
were
and
i
supposed
want
to
rush
right
over
to
them
with
me
and
did
she
rush
asked
boardman
filling
up
a
pause
which
mavering
made
in
wiping
his
face
how
infernally
hot
you
have
it
in
here
he
went
to
the
window
and
threw
it
up
and
then
did
not
sit
down
again
but
continued
to
walk
back
and
forth
as
he
talked
she
did
seem
to
know
who
they
were
at
first
and
when
i
made
her
understand
she
hung
back
and
said
showy
things
and
i
must
say
i
think
she
was
wrong
they
were
dressed
as
quietly
as
of
the
people
there
only
they
are
rather
large
handsome
women
i
said
i
thought
we
ought
to
go
and
speak
to
them
they
seemed
stranded
there
but
she
did
seem
to
see
it
and
when
i
persisted
she
said
you
go
if
you
think
best
but
take
me
to
mamma
and
i
supposed
it
was
all
right
and
i
told
pasmer
be
back
in
a
minute
and
then
i
went
off
to
those
women
and
after
talked
with
them
a
while
i
saw
brinkley
sitting
with
old
bromfield
corey
in
another
corner
and
i
got
them
across
and
introduced
them
after
i
explained
to
brinkley
who
they
were
and
they
began
to
have
a
good
time
and
i
just
so
said
boardman
i
thought
i
had
been
gone
any
while
at
all
from
alice
but
the
weather
had
changed
by
the
time
i
had
got
back
alice
was
pretty
serious
and
she
was
engaged
two
or
three
dances
deep
and
i
could
see
her
looking
over
the
fellows
shoulders
as
she
went
round
and
round
pretty
pale
i
hung
about
till
she
was
free
but
then
she
could
dance
with
me
she
said
her
head
ached
and
she
made
her
mother
take
her
home
before
supper
and
i
mooned
round
like
my
own
ghost
a
while
and
then
i
went
home
and
as
if
that
was
enough
i
could
see
by
the
looks
of
those
other
women
old
corey
forgot
miss
wrayne
in
the
and
i
had
to
take
her
back
that
i
had
made
it
right
with
them
even
they
were
as
hard
and
smooth
as
glass
i
ruined
myself
and
ruined
myself
for
mavering
flung
boardman
chair
over
and
seated
himself
on
its
rungs
i
went
to
bed
and
waited
for
the
next
thing
to
happen
i
found
my
thunderbolt
waiting
for
me
when
i
woke
up
i
did
know
what
it
was
going
to
be
but
when
i
felt
a
ring
through
the
envelope
of
that
note
i
knew
what
it
was
i
that
note
before
i
opened
give
it
to
the
society
for
psychical
research
suggested
boardman
been
to
breakfast
breakfast
echoed
mavering
well
now
boardman
what
use
do
you
suppose
i
got
for
breakfast
under
the
circumstances
well
not
very
much
but
your
story
made
me
pretty
hungry
would
you
mind
turning
your
back
or
going
out
and
sitting
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
landing
or
something
while
i
get
up
and
dress
oh
i
can
go
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
said
mavering
with
unresentful
sadness
but
i
hoped
you
might
have
something
to
suggest
boardy
well
i
suggested
two
things
and
you
do
like
either
why
not
go
round
and
ask
to
see
the
old
lady
mrs
pasmer
well
i
thought
of
that
but
i
did
like
to
mention
it
for
fear
you
sit
on
it
when
would
you
go
well
about
as
quick
as
i
could
get
there
it
early
for
a
call
but
it
a
peculiar
occasion
and
it
show
your
interest
in
the
thing
you
ca
very
well
let
it
cool
on
your
hands
unless
you
mean
to
accept
the
what
do
you
mean
demanded
mavering
getting
up
and
standing
over
boardman
do
you
think
i
could
accept
the
situation
as
you
call
it
and
live
you
did
once
said
boardman
you
could
unless
you
could
fix
it
up
with
frobisher
mavering
blushed
it
was
a
different
thing
altogether
then
i
could
have
broken
off
then
but
i
tell
you
it
would
kill
me
now
i
got
in
too
deep
my
whole
life
set
on
that
girl
you
ca
understand
boardman
because
you
never
been
there
but
i
could
give
her
all
right
better
go
and
see
the
old
lady
without
loss
of
time
or
the
old
man
if
you
mavering
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
again
look
here
boardman
what
do
you
mean
by
what
by
being
so
confoundedly
heartless
did
you
suppose
that
i
wanted
to
pay
those
women
any
attention
last
night
from
an
interested
motive
seems
to
have
been
miss
pasmer
well
you
mistaken
she
had
no
such
impression
she
would
have
too
much
too
much
pride
magnanimity
she
would
know
that
after
such
a
girl
as
she
is
i
could
think
of
any
other
woman
the
thing
is
simply
that
the
theory
it
the
practice
certain
there
no
exception
in
my
case
no
sir
i
tell
you
this
thing
is
for
all
time
for
eternity
it
makes
me
or
it
mars
me
once
for
all
she
may
listen
to
me
or
she
may
not
listen
but
as
long
as
she
lives
there
no
other
woman
alive
for
better
go
and
tell
her
so
you
wasting
your
arguments
on
why
because
i
convinced
already
because
people
always
marry
their
first
and
only
loves
because
people
never
marry
twice
for
love
because
never
seen
you
hit
before
and
i
know
you
never
could
be
again
now
go
and
convince
miss
pasmer
she
believe
you
because
she
know
that
she
can
never
care
for
any
one
but
you
and
you
naturally
ca
care
for
anybody
but
her
it
a
perfectly
clear
case
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
set
it
before
if
i
were
you
i
would
try
to
work
that
cynical
racket
boardman
said
mavering
he
rose
but
he
sighed
drearily
and
regarded
grin
with
absence
but
he
went
away
without
saying
anything
more
and
walked
mechanically
toward
the
cavendish
as
he
rang
at
the
door
of
pasmer
apartments
he
recalled
another
early
visit
he
had
paid
there
he
thought
how
joyful
and
exuberant
he
was
then
and
how
crushed
and
desperate
now
he
was
not
without
youthful
satisfaction
in
the
disparity
of
his
different
moods
it
seemed
to
stamp
him
as
a
man
of
large
and
varied
experience
xxxviii
pasmer
was
genuinely
surprised
to
see
mavering
and
he
pursued
his
advantage
if
it
was
an
advantage
by
coming
directly
to
the
point
he
took
it
for
granted
that
she
knew
all
about
the
matter
and
he
threw
himself
upon
her
mercy
without
delay
mrs
pasmer
you
must
help
me
about
this
business
with
alice
he
broke
out
at
once
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
i
know
i
can
explain
it
of
course
he
added
smiling
ruefully
the
two
statements
hang
together
but
what
i
mean
is
that
if
i
can
find
out
what
the
trouble
is
i
can
make
it
all
right
because
there
nothing
wrong
about
it
do
you
see
pasmer
tried
to
keep
the
mystification
out
of
her
eye
but
she
could
not
even
succeed
in
seeming
to
do
so
which
she
would
have
liked
almost
as
well
do
you
know
what
i
mean
asked
dan
pasmer
chanced
it
that
alice
was
a
little
out
of
sorts
last
night
she
queried
leadingly
yes
said
mavering
fervently
and
about
her
her
writing
to
writing
to
you
pasmer
was
going
to
ask
when
dan
gave
her
the
letter
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
show
it
but
i
must
i
must
have
your
help
and
i
ca
unless
you
understand
the
pasmer
had
begun
to
read
the
note
it
explained
what
the
girl
herself
had
refused
to
give
any
satisfactory
reason
for
her
early
retirement
from
the
reception
her
mysterious
disappearance
into
her
own
room
on
reaching
home
and
her
resolute
silence
on
the
way
pasmer
had
known
that
there
must
be
some
trouble
with
dan
and
she
had
suspected
that
alice
was
vexed
with
him
on
account
of
those
women
but
it
was
beyond
her
cheerful
imagination
that
she
should
go
to
such
lengths
in
her
resentment
she
could
conceive
of
her
wishing
to
punish
him
to
retaliate
her
suffering
on
him
but
to
renounce
him
for
it
was
another
thing
and
she
did
not
attribute
to
her
daughter
any
other
motive
than
she
would
have
felt
herself
it
was
always
this
way
with
pasmer
she
followed
her
daughter
accurately
up
to
a
certain
point
beyond
that
she
did
not
believe
the
girl
knew
herself
what
she
meant
and
perhaps
she
was
not
altogether
wrong
girlhood
is
often
a
turmoil
of
wild
impulses
ignorant
exaltations
mistaken
ideals
which
really
represent
no
intelligent
purpose
and
come
from
disordered
nerves
reading
and
the
erroneous
perspective
of
inexperience
pasmer
felt
this
and
she
was
tempted
to
break
into
a
laugh
over
heroics
but
she
preferred
to
keep
a
serious
countenance
partly
because
she
did
not
feel
the
least
seriously
she
was
instantly
resolved
not
to
let
this
letter
accomplish
anything
more
than
dan
temporary
abasement
and
she
would
have
preferred
to
shorten
this
to
the
briefest
moment
possible
she
liked
him
and
she
was
convinced
that
alice
could
never
do
better
if
half
so
well
she
would
now
have
preferred
to
treat
him
with
familiar
confidence
to
tell
him
that
she
had
no
idea
of
alice
writing
him
that
nonsensical
letter
and
he
was
not
to
pay
the
least
attention
to
it
for
of
course
it
meant
nothing
but
another
principle
of
her
complex
nature
came
into
play
and
she
silently
folded
the
note
and
returned
it
to
dan
trembling
before
her
well
he
quavered
well
returned
pasmer
judicially
while
she
enjoyed
his
tremor
whose
needlessness
inwardly
amused
her
well
of
course
alice
was
annoyed
i
know
and
it
was
all
my
fault
or
my
misfortune
but
i
assure
you
pasmer
that
i
thought
i
was
doing
something
that
would
please
her
in
the
highest
and
noblest
way
now
do
you
know
i
did
pasmer
again
wished
to
laugh
but
in
the
face
of
dan
tragedy
she
had
to
forbear
she
contented
herself
with
saying
of
course
but
perhaps
it
was
the
best
time
for
pleasing
her
just
in
that
it
was
then
or
never
i
can
see
now
why
i
could
see
all
the
time
just
how
it
might
look
but
i
supposed
alice
would
care
for
that
and
if
i
had
tried
to
make
some
reparation
then
to
frobisher
and
her
sister
i
never
could
do
you
see
yes
certainly
but
and
alice
herself
told
me
to
go
and
look
after
them
interposed
mavering
he
suppressed
a
little
uncandidly
the
fact
of
her
first
reluctance
but
you
know
it
was
the
first
time
you
had
been
out
together
and
naturally
she
would
wish
to
have
you
a
good
deal
to
herself
or
at
least
not
seeming
to
run
after
other
yes
yes
i
know
and
no
one
ever
likes
to
be
taken
at
their
word
in
a
thing
like
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
but
i
did
i
wish
i
had
gone
to
you
first
pasmer
somehow
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
were
very
young
and
inexperienced
i
did
use
to
feel
so
i
wish
you
were
always
on
hand
to
advise
me
dan
hung
his
head
and
his
face
usually
so
gay
was
blotted
with
gloom
will
you
take
my
advice
now
asked
pasmer
indeed
i
will
cried
the
young
fellow
lifting
his
head
what
is
it
see
alice
about
dan
jumped
to
his
feet
and
the
sunshine
broke
out
over
his
face
again
mrs
pasmer
i
promised
to
take
your
advice
and
i
do
it
i
will
see
her
but
how
where
let
me
have
your
advice
on
that
point
they
began
to
laugh
together
and
dan
was
at
once
inexpressibly
happy
those
two
light
natures
thoroughly
comprehended
each
other
pasmer
had
proposed
his
seeing
alice
with
due
seriousness
but
now
she
had
a
longing
to
let
herself
go
she
felt
all
the
pleasure
that
other
people
felt
in
doing
dan
mavering
a
pleasure
and
something
more
because
he
was
so
perfectly
intelligible
to
her
she
let
herself
go
you
might
stay
to
mrs
pasmer
i
will
i
will
do
that
too
i
awfully
hungry
and
i
put
myself
in
your
let
me
see
said
pasmer
thoughtfully
how
it
can
be
yes
said
mavering
ready
for
a
panic
how
she
would
stand
a
surprise
no
i
had
thought
of
no
or
business
no
said
pasmer
with
a
light
sigh
alice
is
peculiar
afraid
she
would
like
is
there
any
little
ruse
she
would
like
i
ca
think
of
any
perhaps
i
better
go
and
tell
her
you
here
and
wish
to
see
do
you
think
you
better
asked
dan
doubtfully
perhaps
she
she
will
come
said
pasmer
confidently
she
did
not
say
that
she
thought
alice
would
be
curious
to
know
why
he
had
come
and
that
she
was
too
just
to
condemn
him
unheard
but
she
was
right
about
the
main
point
alice
came
and
dan
could
see
with
his
own
weary
eyes
that
she
had
not
slept
either
she
stopped
just
inside
the
portiere
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
but
he
could
not
though
a
smile
from
his
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
their
seriousness
hovered
about
his
lips
his
first
impulse
was
to
rush
upon
her
and
catch
her
in
his
arms
and
perhaps
this
might
have
been
well
but
the
moment
for
it
passed
and
then
it
became
impossible
well
she
said
at
last
lifting
her
head
and
looking
at
him
with
impassioned
solemnity
you
wished
to
see
me
i
hoped
you
would
it
would
have
spared
me
something
but
perhaps
i
had
no
right
to
your
alice
how
can
you
say
such
things
to
me
asked
the
young
fellow
deeply
hurt
she
responded
to
his
tone
i
sorry
if
it
wounds
you
but
i
only
mean
what
i
you
a
right
to
my
forbearance
and
not
only
that
but
to
my
my
life
to
everything
that
i
am
cried
dan
in
a
quiver
of
tenderness
at
the
sight
of
her
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
alice
why
did
you
write
me
that
letter
why
did
you
send
me
back
my
ring
because
she
said
looking
him
seriously
in
the
face
because
i
wished
you
to
be
free
to
be
well
you
gone
the
wrong
way
about
it
i
can
never
be
free
from
you
i
never
can
be
happy
without
i
did
it
for
your
good
then
which
ought
to
be
above
your
happiness
do
think
i
acted
hastily
i
thought
it
over
all
night
long
i
sleep
neither
did
i
interposed
dan
and
i
saw
that
i
had
no
claim
to
you
that
you
never
could
be
truly
happy
with
me
i
take
the
chances
he
interrupted
alice
you
do
suppose
i
cared
for
those
women
any
more
than
the
ground
under
your
feet
do
you
i
do
suppose
i
should
ever
have
given
them
a
second
thought
if
you
had
seemed
to
feel
so
badly
about
my
neglecting
them
and
i
thought
you
be
pleased
to
have
me
try
to
make
it
up
to
them
if
i
i
know
your
motive
was
good
the
noblest
do
think
that
i
did
you
injustice
or
that
i
was
vexed
because
you
went
away
with
you
sent
yes
and
now
i
give
you
up
to
them
altogether
it
was
a
mistake
a
crime
for
me
to
think
we
could
be
anything
to
each
other
when
our
love
began
with
a
wrong
to
some
one
with
a
wrong
to
some
one
else
you
neglected
them
on
class
day
after
you
saw
why
of
course
i
did
how
could
i
help
it
a
flush
of
pleasure
came
into
the
girl
pale
face
but
she
banished
it
and
continued
gravely
then
at
portland
you
were
with
them
all
you
given
me
up
you
thrown
me
over
alice
he
pleaded
i
know
that
i
do
blame
you
but
you
made
them
believe
that
you
were
very
much
interested
in
i
do
know
what
i
did
i
was
perfectly
yes
it
was
my
fault
and
then
when
they
came
to
meet
you
at
the
museum
i
had
made
you
forget
them
i
made
you
wound
them
and
insult
them
again
no
i
thought
it
all
out
and
we
never
could
be
happy
do
think
that
i
do
it
from
any
resentful
alice
how
could
i
think
that
of
you
i
have
tried
prayed
to
be
purified
from
that
and
i
believe
that
i
have
you
never
had
a
selfish
and
i
have
come
to
see
that
you
were
perfectly
right
in
what
you
did
last
night
at
first
i
was
oh
did
i
wound
you
alice
he
grieved
but
afterward
i
could
see
that
you
belonged
to
them
and
not
me
and
and
i
give
you
up
to
them
yes
freely
alice
stood
there
beautiful
pathetic
austere
and
dan
had
halted
in
the
spot
to
which
he
had
advanced
when
her
eye
forbade
him
to
approach
nearer
he
did
not
mean
to
joke
and
it
was
in
despair
that
he
cried
out
but
which
alice
there
are
two
of
two
she
repeated
vaguely
yes
frobisher
and
miss
wrayne
you
ca
give
me
up
to
both
of
both
she
repeated
again
she
could
not
condescend
to
specify
it
would
be
ridiculous
and
as
it
was
she
felt
her
dignity
hopelessly
shaken
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
yes
and
neither
of
them
wants
me
they
have
got
any
use
for
me
frobisher
is
married
already
and
miss
wrayne
took
the
trouble
last
night
to
let
me
feel
that
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
i
had
made
it
all
right
and
could
i
thought
i
had
rather
a
cold
parting
with
you
alice
but
it
was
quite
tropical
to
what
you
left
me
a
faint
smile
mingled
with
a
blush
of
relenting
stole
into
her
face
and
he
hurried
on
i
do
suppose
i
tried
very
hard
to
thaw
her
out
i
was
much
interested
if
you
must
give
me
up
you
must
give
me
up
to
some
one
else
for
they
do
want
me
and
i
do
want
alice
head
dropped
lover
and
he
could
come
nearer
now
without
her
seeming
to
know
it
but
why
need
you
give
me
up
there
really
no
occasion
for
it
i
assure
i
wished
she
explained
to
show
you
that
i
loved
you
for
something
above
yourself
and
myself
far
above
either
she
stopped
and
dropped
the
hand
which
she
had
raised
to
fend
him
off
and
he
profited
by
the
little
pause
she
made
to
take
her
in
his
arms
without
seeming
to
do
so
well
he
said
i
do
believe
i
was
formed
to
be
loved
on
a
very
high
plane
but
i
not
too
proud
to
be
loved
for
my
own
sake
and
i
do
think
there
anything
above
you
oh
yes
there
is
i
do
deserve
to
be
happy
and
that
the
reason
why
i
not
allowed
to
be
happy
in
any
noble
way
i
ca
bear
to
give
you
up
you
know
i
ca
but
you
ought
to
give
me
up
indeed
you
ought
i
have
ideals
but
i
ca
live
up
to
them
you
ought
to
go
you
ought
to
leave
she
accented
each
little
sentence
by
vividly
pressing
herself
to
his
heart
and
he
had
the
wisdom
or
the
instinct
to
treat
their
reconciliation
as
nothing
settled
but
merely
provisional
in
its
nature
well
we
see
about
that
i
do
want
to
go
till
after
breakfast
anyway
your
mother
says
i
may
stay
and
i
awfully
hungry
if
i
see
anything
particularly
base
in
you
perhaps
i
come
back
to
dan
would
have
liked
to
turn
it
alt
off
into
a
joke
now
that
the
worst
was
apparently
over
but
alice
freed
herself
from
him
and
held
him
off
with
her
hand
set
against
his
breast
does
mamma
know
about
it
she
demanded
sternly
well
she
knows
there
been
some
misunderstanding
said
dan
with
a
laugh
that
was
anxious
in
view
of
the
clouds
possibly
gathering
again
how
much
well
i
ca
say
he
would
not
say
that
he
did
not
know
but
he
felt
that
he
could
truly
say
that
he
could
not
say
she
dropped
her
hand
and
consented
to
be
deceived
dan
caught
her
again
to
his
breast
but
he
had
an
odd
vague
sense
of
doing
it
carefully
of
using
a
little
of
the
caution
with
which
one
seizes
the
stem
of
a
rose
between
the
thorns
i
can
bear
to
be
ridiculous
with
you
she
whispered
with
an
implication
which
he
understood
you
have
been
ridiculous
dearest
he
said
and
his
tension
gave
way
in
a
convulsive
laugh
which
partially
expressed
his
feeling
of
restored
security
and
partly
his
amusement
in
realising
how
the
situation
would
have
pleased
pasmer
if
she
could
have
known
it
pasmer
was
seated
behind
her
coffee
biggin
at
the
when
he
came
into
the
room
with
alice
and
she
lifted
an
eye
from
its
glass
bulb
long
enough
to
catch
his
flying
glance
of
exultation
and
admonition
then
while
she
regarded
the
chemical
struggle
in
the
bulb
with
the
rapt
eye
of
a
magician
reading
fate
in
his
crystal
ball
she
questioned
herself
how
much
she
should
know
and
how
much
she
should
ignore
it
was
a
great
moment
for
pasmer
full
of
delicious
choice
do
you
understand
this
process
mavering
she
said
glancing
up
at
him
warily
for
farther
instruction
i
seen
it
done
said
dan
but
i
never
knew
how
it
was
managed
i
always
thought
it
was
going
to
blow
up
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
you
were
good
and
true
and
very
meek
and
had
a
conscience
void
of
offence
it
yes
that
what
it
seems
to
depend
upon
said
pasmer
keeping
her
eye
on
the
bulb
she
dodged
suddenly
forward
and
put
out
the
now
have
your
coffee
she
cried
with
a
great
air
of
relief
you
must
need
it
by
this
time
she
said
with
a
low
cynical
laugh
both
of
you
did
you
always
make
coffee
with
a
biggin
in
france
pasmer
asked
dan
and
he
laughed
out
the
last
burden
that
lurked
in
his
heart
pasmer
joined
him
no
mavering
in
france
you
do
need
a
biggin
i
set
mine
up
when
we
went
to
alice
looked
darkly
from
one
of
these
light
spirits
to
the
other
and
then
they
all
shrieked
together
they
went
on
talking
volubly
from
that
and
they
talked
as
far
away
from
what
they
were
thinking
about
as
possible
they
talked
of
europe
and
pasmer
said
where
they
would
live
and
what
they
would
do
when
they
all
got
back
there
together
dan
abetted
her
and
said
that
they
must
cross
in
june
pasmer
said
that
she
thought
june
was
a
good
month
he
asked
if
it
were
not
the
month
of
the
marriages
too
and
she
answered
that
he
must
ask
alice
about
that
alice
blushed
and
laughed
her
sweet
reluctant
laugh
and
said
she
did
not
know
she
had
never
been
married
it
was
silly
but
it
was
delicious
it
made
them
really
one
family
deep
in
his
consciousness
a
compunction
pierced
and
teased
dan
but
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
all
a
joke
about
their
european
plans
or
else
his
people
would
consent
to
it
if
he
really
wished
it
xxxix
a
period
of
entire
harmony
and
tenderness
followed
the
episode
which
seemed
to
threaten
the
lovers
with
the
loss
of
each
other
mavering
forbore
to
make
alice
feel
that
in
attempting
a
sacrifice
which
consulted
only
his
good
and
ignored
his
happiness
and
then
failing
in
it
so
promptly
she
had
played
rather
a
silly
part
after
one
or
two
tentative
jokes
in
that
direction
he
found
the
ground
unsafe
and
with
the
instinct
which
served
him
in
place
of
more
premeditated
piety
he
withdrew
and
was
able
to
treat
the
affair
with
something
like
religious
awe
he
was
obliged
in
fact
to
steady
alice
own
faith
in
it
and
to
keep
her
from
falling
under
dangerous
in
that
and
other
excesses
of
uninstructed
this
brought
no
fatigue
to
his
robust
affection
whatever
it
might
have
done
to
a
heart
more
tried
in
such
exercises
love
acquaints
youth
with
many
things
in
character
and
temperament
which
are
none
the
less
interesting
because
it
never
explains
them
and
dan
was
of
such
a
make
that
its
revelations
of
alice
were
charming
to
him
because
they
were
novel
he
had
thought
her
a
person
of
such
serene
and
flawless
wisdom
that
it
was
rather
a
relief
to
find
her
subject
to
gusts
of
imprudence
to
unexpected
passions
and
resentments
to
foibles
and
errors
like
other
people
her
power
of
cold
reticence
which
she
could
employ
at
will
was
something
that
fascinated
him
almost
as
much
as
that
habit
of
impulsive
concession
which
seemed
to
came
neither
from
her
will
nor
her
reason
he
was
a
person
himself
who
was
so
eager
to
give
other
people
pleasure
that
he
quivered
with
impatience
to
see
them
happy
through
his
words
or
acts
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
any
one
to
whom
he
was
speaking
was
not
perfectly
comfortable
in
regard
to
him
and
it
was
for
this
reason
perhaps
that
he
admired
a
girl
who
could
prescribe
herself
a
line
of
social
conduct
and
follow
it
out
regardless
of
individual
pangs
who
could
act
from
ideals
and
principles
and
not
from
emotions
and
sympathies
he
knew
that
she
had
the
emotions
and
sympathies
for
there
were
times
when
she
lavished
them
on
him
and
that
she
could
seem
without
them
was
another
proof
of
that
depth
of
nature
which
he
liked
to
imagine
had
first
attracted
him
to
her
dan
mavering
had
never
been
able
to
snub
any
one
in
his
life
it
gave
him
a
great
respect
for
alice
that
it
seemed
not
to
cost
her
an
effort
or
a
regret
and
it
charmed
him
to
think
that
her
severity
was
part
of
the
unconscious
sham
which
imposed
her
upon
the
world
for
a
person
of
inflexible
design
and
invariable
constancy
to
it
he
was
not
long
in
seeing
that
she
shared
this
illusion
if
it
was
an
illusion
and
that
perhaps
the
only
person
besides
himself
who
was
in
the
joke
was
her
mother
pasmer
and
he
grew
more
and
more
into
each
confidence
in
talking
alice
over
and
he
admired
the
intrepidity
of
this
lady
who
was
not
afraid
of
her
daughter
even
in
the
girl
most
topping
moments
of
for
his
own
part
these
moods
of
hers
never
failed
to
cause
him
confusion
and
anxiety
they
commonly
intimated
themselves
parenthetically
in
the
midst
of
some
blissful
talk
they
were
having
and
overcast
his
clear
sky
with
retrospective
ideals
of
conduct
or
presentimental
plans
for
contingencies
that
might
never
occur
he
found
himself
suddenly
under
condemnation
for
not
having
reproved
her
at
a
given
time
when
she
forced
him
to
admit
she
had
seemed
unkind
or
cold
to
others
she
made
him
promise
that
even
at
the
risk
of
alienating
her
affections
he
would
make
up
for
her
deficiencies
of
behaviour
in
such
matters
whenever
he
noticed
them
she
now
praised
him
for
what
he
had
done
for
frobisher
and
her
sister
at
bellingham
reception
she
said
it
was
generous
heroic
but
mavering
rested
satisfied
with
his
achievement
in
that
instance
and
did
not
attempt
anything
else
of
the
kind
he
did
not
reason
from
cause
to
effect
in
regard
to
it
a
love
is
such
that
while
it
lasts
he
can
not
project
its
object
far
enough
from
him
to
judge
it
reasonable
or
unreasonable
but
dan
instincts
had
been
disciplined
and
his
perceptions
sharpened
by
that
experience
besides
in
bidding
him
take
this
impartial
and
even
admonitory
course
toward
her
she
stipulated
that
they
should
maintain
to
the
world
a
perfect
harmony
of
conduct
which
should
be
an
outward
image
of
the
union
of
their
lives
she
said
that
anything
less
than
a
continued
of
one
to
the
other
was
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
love
and
that
she
should
not
be
happy
unless
he
required
this
of
her
she
said
that
they
ought
each
to
find
out
what
was
the
most
distasteful
thing
which
they
could
mutually
require
and
then
do
it
she
asked
him
to
try
to
think
what
she
most
hated
and
let
her
do
that
for
him
as
for
her
she
only
asked
to
ask
nothing
of
him
mavering
could
not
worship
enough
this
nobility
of
soul
in
her
and
he
celebrated
it
to
boardman
with
the
passionate
need
of
imparting
his
rapture
which
a
lover
feel
boardman
acquiesced
in
silence
with
a
glance
of
reserved
sarcasm
or
contented
himself
with
laconic
satire
of
his
friend
general
condition
and
avoided
any
comment
that
might
specifically
apply
to
the
points
dan
made
alice
allowed
him
to
have
this
confidant
and
did
not
demand
of
him
a
report
of
all
he
said
to
boardman
a
main
fact
of
their
love
she
said
must
be
their
utter
faith
in
each
other
she
had
her
own
confidante
and
the
disparity
of
years
between
her
and
miss
cotton
counted
for
nothing
in
the
friendship
which
their
exchange
of
trust
and
sympathy
cemented
miss
cotton
in
the
freshness
of
her
sympathy
and
the
ideality
of
her
inexperience
was
in
fact
younger
than
alice
at
whose
feet
in
the
things
of
soul
and
character
she
loved
to
sit
she
never
said
to
her
what
she
believed
that
a
girl
of
her
exemplary
principles
a
nature
conscious
of
such
noble
ideals
so
superior
to
other
girls
who
in
her
place
would
be
given
up
to
the
happiness
of
the
moment
and
indifferent
to
the
sense
of
duty
to
herself
and
to
others
was
sacrificed
to
a
person
of
gay
bright
nature
and
trivial
conception
of
life
she
did
not
deny
his
sweetness
that
was
perhaps
the
one
saving
thing
about
him
and
she
confessed
that
he
simply
adored
alice
that
counted
for
everything
and
it
was
everything
in
his
favour
that
he
could
appreciate
such
a
girl
she
hoped
she
prayed
that
alice
might
never
realise
how
little
depth
he
had
that
she
might
go
through
life
and
never
suspect
it
if
she
did
so
then
they
might
be
happy
together
to
the
end
or
at
least
alice
might
never
know
she
was
unhappy
miss
cotton
never
said
these
things
in
so
many
words
it
is
doubtful
if
she
ever
said
them
in
any
form
of
words
with
her
sensitive
anxiety
not
to
do
injustice
to
any
one
she
took
dan
part
against
those
who
viewed
the
engagement
as
she
allowed
it
to
appear
only
to
her
secret
heart
she
defended
him
the
more
eagerly
because
she
felt
that
it
was
for
sake
and
that
everything
must
be
done
to
keep
her
from
knowing
how
people
looked
at
the
affair
even
to
changing
people
minds
she
said
to
all
who
spoke
to
her
of
it
that
of
course
alice
was
superior
to
him
but
he
was
devoted
to
her
and
he
would
grow
into
an
equality
with
her
he
was
naturally
very
refined
she
said
and
if
he
was
not
a
very
serious
person
he
was
amiable
beyond
anything
she
alleged
many
little
incidents
of
their
acquaintance
at
campobello
in
proof
of
her
theory
that
he
had
an
instinctive
appreciation
of
alice
and
she
was
sure
that
no
one
could
value
her
nobleness
of
character
more
than
he
she
had
seen
them
a
good
deal
together
since
their
engagement
and
it
was
beautiful
to
see
his
manner
with
her
they
were
opposites
but
she
counted
a
good
deal
upon
that
very
difference
in
their
temperaments
to
draw
them
to
each
other
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
see
dan
and
alice
together
their
engagement
came
out
in
the
usual
way
it
had
been
announced
to
a
few
of
their
nearest
friends
and
intelligence
of
it
soon
spread
from
their
own
set
through
society
generally
it
had
been
published
in
the
sunday
papers
while
it
was
still
in
the
tender
condition
of
a
rumour
and
had
been
denied
by
some
of
their
acquaintance
and
believed
by
all
the
pasmer
cousinship
had
been
just
in
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
blood
toward
alice
since
the
return
of
her
family
from
europe
and
now
did
what
was
proper
in
the
circumstances
all
who
were
connected
with
her
called
upon
her
and
congratulated
her
they
knew
dan
the
younger
of
them
much
better
than
they
knew
her
and
though
he
had
shrunk
from
the
nebulous
bulk
of
social
potentiality
which
every
young
man
is
to
that
much
smaller
nucleus
to
which
definite
betrothal
reduces
him
they
could
be
perfectly
sincere
in
calling
him
the
sweetest
fellow
that
ever
was
and
too
lovely
to
live
in
such
a
matter
pasmer
was
naturally
nothing
he
could
not
be
less
than
he
was
at
other
times
but
he
was
not
more
and
it
was
pasmer
who
shared
fully
with
her
daughter
the
momentary
interest
which
the
engagement
gave
alice
with
all
her
kindred
they
believed
of
course
that
they
recognised
in
it
an
effect
of
her
skill
in
managing
they
agreed
to
suppose
that
she
had
got
mavering
for
alice
and
to
ignore
the
beauty
and
passion
of
youth
as
factors
in
the
case
the
closest
of
the
kindred
with
the
romantic
delicacy
of
americans
in
such
things
approached
the
question
of
dan
position
and
prospects
and
heard
with
satisfaction
the
good
accounts
which
pasmer
was
able
to
give
of
his
father
prosperity
there
had
always
been
more
or
less
apprehension
among
them
of
a
time
when
a
family
subscription
would
be
necessary
for
bob
pasmer
and
in
the
relief
which
the
new
situation
gave
them
some
of
them
tried
to
remember
having
known
dan
father
in
college
but
it
finally
came
to
their
guessing
that
they
must
have
heard
john
munt
speak
of
him
pasmer
had
a
supreme
control
in
the
affair
she
believed
with
the
rest
so
deeply
is
this
delusion
seated
that
she
had
made
the
match
but
knowing
herself
to
have
used
no
dishonest
magic
in
the
process
she
was
able
to
enjoy
it
with
a
clean
conscience
she
grew
fonder
of
dan
they
understood
each
other
she
was
his
refuge
from
alice
ideals
and
helped
him
laugh
off
his
perplexity
with
them
they
were
none
the
less
sincere
because
they
were
not
in
the
least
frank
with
each
other
she
let
dan
beat
about
the
bush
to
his
heart
content
and
waited
for
him
at
the
point
which
she
knew
he
was
coming
to
with
an
unconsciousness
which
he
knew
was
factitious
neither
of
them
got
tired
of
this
or
failed
freshly
to
admire
the
other
strategy
xl
it
can
not
be
pretended
that
alice
was
quite
pleased
with
the
way
her
friends
took
her
engagement
or
rather
the
way
in
which
they
spoke
of
dan
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
alone
or
she
chiefly
ought
to
feel
that
sweetness
and
loveliness
of
which
every
one
told
her
as
if
she
could
not
have
known
it
if
he
was
sweet
and
lovely
to
every
one
how
was
he
different
to
her
except
in
degree
ought
he
not
to
be
different
in
kind
she
put
the
case
to
miss
cotton
whom
it
puzzled
while
she
assured
alice
that
he
was
different
in
kind
to
her
though
he
might
not
seem
so
the
very
fact
that
he
was
different
in
degree
proved
that
he
was
different
in
kind
this
logic
sufficed
for
the
moment
of
its
expression
but
it
did
not
prevent
alice
from
putting
the
case
to
dan
himself
at
one
of
those
little
times
when
she
sat
beside
him
alone
and
rearranged
his
necktie
or
played
with
his
watch
chain
or
passed
a
critical
hand
over
his
cowlick
she
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
they
ought
to
have
an
ideal
in
their
engagement
what
ideal
he
asked
he
thought
it
was
all
solid
ideal
through
and
through
oh
she
said
be
more
and
more
to
each
he
said
he
did
not
see
how
that
could
be
if
there
was
anything
more
of
him
she
was
welcome
to
it
but
he
rather
thought
she
had
it
all
she
explained
that
she
meant
being
less
to
others
and
he
asked
her
to
explain
that
well
when
we
anywhere
together
do
you
think
we
ought
to
show
how
different
we
are
to
each
other
from
what
we
are
to
any
one
dan
laughed
i
afraid
we
do
alice
i
always
supposed
one
ought
to
hide
that
little
preference
as
much
as
possible
you
do
want
me
to
be
dangling
after
you
every
moment
but
not
dangle
after
dan
sighed
a
little
a
little
impatiently
do
i
dangle
after
others
of
course
not
but
show
that
we
thoroughly
united
in
all
our
tastes
and
feelings
and
like
and
dislike
the
same
i
do
think
that
will
be
difficult
said
dan
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
she
said
you
do
like
to
have
me
bring
up
such
things
oh
yes
i
do
i
wish
to
be
and
do
just
what
you
but
i
can
see
i
can
understand
that
you
would
sooner
pass
the
time
without
talking
of
them
you
like
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
not
to
have
any
cares
when
when
you
with
me
this
way
well
yes
i
suppose
i
do
said
dan
laughing
again
i
suppose
i
rather
do
like
to
keep
pleasure
and
duty
apart
but
there
nothing
you
can
wish
alice
that
is
a
pleasure
to
i
very
different
said
the
girl
i
ca
be
at
peace
unless
i
know
that
i
have
a
right
to
be
so
but
now
after
this
i
going
to
do
your
way
if
it
your
way
it
be
the
right
way
for
she
looked
sublimely
resolved
with
a
grand
lift
of
the
eyes
and
dan
caught
her
to
him
in
a
rapture
breaking
into
laughter
oh
do
mine
a
bad
way
the
worst
kind
of
a
way
he
cried
it
makes
everybody
like
you
and
mine
makes
nobody
like
it
makes
me
like
you
and
that
quite
enough
i
do
want
other
people
to
like
you
yes
that
what
i
mean
cried
alice
and
now
she
flung
herself
on
his
neck
and
the
tears
came
do
you
suppose
it
can
be
very
pleasant
to
have
everybody
talking
of
you
as
if
everybody
loved
you
as
much
as
much
as
i
do
she
clutched
him
tighter
and
sobbed
o
alice
alice
alice
nobody
could
ever
be
what
you
are
to
me
he
soothed
and
comforted
her
with
endearing
words
and
touches
but
before
he
could
have
believed
her
half
consoled
she
pulled
away
from
him
and
asked
with
shining
eyes
do
you
think
boardman
is
a
good
influence
in
your
life
boardman
cried
mavering
in
astonishment
why
i
thought
you
liked
boardman
i
do
and
i
respect
him
very
much
but
that
is
the
question
you
think
we
ought
to
ask
ourselves
how
others
influence
us
well
i
do
see
much
of
boardy
nowadays
but
i
like
to
drop
down
and
touch
earth
in
boardy
once
in
a
while
i
in
the
air
so
much
board
has
more
more
solid
than
anybody
i
know
kept
me
from
making
a
fool
of
myself
more
times
was
he
with
you
that
day
with
with
those
women
in
portland
dan
winced
a
little
and
then
laughed
no
he
was
that
was
the
trouble
boardman
was
off
on
the
press
boat
i
thought
i
told
you
but
if
you
object
to
boardman
i
do
you
must
think
i
object
to
people
when
i
ask
you
about
them
all
that
i
wished
was
that
you
should
think
yourself
what
sort
of
influence
he
was
i
think
he
a
very
good
he
a
splendid
fellow
boardman
is
alice
cried
dan
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
he
fought
his
way
through
college
on
such
a
little
money
and
never
skulked
or
felt
mean
he
was
appreciated
for
it
the
men
do
notice
these
things
much
but
he
did
want
to
have
it
noticed
always
acted
as
if
it
was
neither
here
nor
there
and
now
i
guess
he
sends
out
home
whatever
he
has
left
after
keeping
soul
and
body
together
every
he
spoke
perhaps
with
too
great
an
effect
of
relief
alice
listened
as
it
seemed
to
his
tone
rather
than
his
words
and
said
absently
yes
that
grand
but
i
do
want
you
to
act
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
me
in
such
afraid
dan
echoed
i
do
mean
actually
afraid
but
as
if
you
thought
i
could
be
reasonable
as
if
you
supposed
i
did
expect
you
to
make
mistakes
or
to
be
yes
i
know
you
very
reasonable
and
you
more
patient
with
me
than
i
deserve
i
know
all
that
and
it
only
my
wish
to
come
up
to
your
standard
i
suppose
that
gives
me
that
apprehensive
that
was
what
vexed
me
with
you
there
at
campobello
when
you
asked
me
yes
i
you
ought
to
have
understood
me
better
you
ought
to
know
now
that
i
do
wish
you
to
do
anything
on
my
account
but
because
it
something
we
owe
to
oh
excuse
me
i
much
rather
do
it
for
you
cried
dan
but
alice
looked
so
grave
so
hurt
that
he
hastened
on
how
in
the
world
does
it
concern
others
whether
we
are
devoted
or
not
whether
we
harmonious
and
and
all
that
he
could
not
help
being
light
about
it
how
alice
repeated
wo
it
give
them
an
idea
of
what
what
of
how
much
how
truly
if
we
care
for
each
other
how
people
ought
to
care
we
do
do
it
for
ourselves
that
would
be
selfish
and
disgusting
we
do
it
because
it
something
that
we
owe
to
the
idea
of
being
engaged
of
having
devoted
our
lives
to
each
other
and
would
show
would
teach
oh
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
said
dan
and
he
gave
way
in
a
sputtering
laugh
but
they
would
understand
they
only
think
we
were
spoons
on
each
other
and
if
they
noticed
that
i
cooled
off
toward
people
i
liked
and
warmed
up
toward
those
you
liked
they
say
you
made
should
you
care
asked
alice
sublimely
withdrawing
a
little
from
his
arm
oh
no
only
on
your
account
he
answered
checking
his
laugh
you
need
on
my
account
she
returned
if
we
sacrifice
some
little
preferences
to
each
other
is
that
right
i
shall
be
glad
to
sacrifice
all
of
mine
to
you
is
our
marriage
to
be
full
of
such
sacrifices
i
expect
to
give
up
everything
to
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sad
severity
he
began
to
laugh
again
oh
no
alice
do
do
that
i
could
stand
it
i
want
some
little
chance
at
the
renunciations
she
withdrew
still
further
from
his
side
and
said
with
a
cold
anger
it
that
detestable
mrs
brinkley
shouted
dan
yes
with
her
pessimism
i
have
heard
her
talk
she
influences
you
nothing
is
sacred
to
her
it
was
she
who
took
up
with
those
army
women
that
well
alice
i
must
say
you
can
give
things
as
ugly
names
as
the
next
one
i
have
seen
brinkley
the
whole
winter
except
in
your
company
but
she
has
more
sense
than
all
the
other
women
i
oh
thank
you
you
know
i
do
mean
you
he
pushed
on
and
she
is
a
pessimist
she
very
kindhearted
and
that
night
she
was
very
polite
and
good
to
those
army
women
as
you
call
them
when
you
had
refused
to
say
a
word
or
do
anything
for
i
knew
it
had
been
rankling
in
your
mind
all
along
said
the
girl
i
expected
it
to
coma
out
sooner
or
later
and
you
talk
about
renunciation
you
never
forget
nor
forgive
the
slightest
thing
but
i
do
ask
your
alice
no
you
are
as
hard
as
iron
you
have
that
pleasant
outside
manner
that
makes
people
think
you
very
gentle
and
yielding
but
all
the
time
you
like
adamant
i
would
rather
die
than
ask
your
forgiveness
for
anything
and
you
rather
let
me
than
give
well
then
i
ask
your
forgiveness
alice
and
i
sure
you
wo
let
me
die
without
they
regarded
each
other
a
moment
then
the
tenderness
gushed
up
in
their
hearts
a
passionate
tide
and
swept
them
into
each
other
arms
o
dan
she
cried
how
sweet
you
are
how
good
how
lovely
oh
how
wonderful
it
is
i
wanted
to
hate
you
but
i
could
i
could
do
anything
but
love
you
yes
now
i
understand
what
love
is
and
how
it
can
do
everything
and
last
for
xli
mavering
came
to
lunch
the
next
day
and
had
a
word
with
pasmer
before
alice
came
in
pasmer
usually
lunched
at
the
club
we
do
see
much
of
saintsbury
nowadays
he
suggested
no
it
a
great
way
to
cambridge
said
pasmer
stifling
in
a
little
sigh
of
apparent
regret
for
the
separation
the
curiosity
she
felt
as
to
dan
motive
in
mentioning
saintsbury
she
was
very
patient
with
him
when
he
went
on
yes
it
is
a
great
way
and
a
strange
thing
about
it
is
that
when
you
living
here
it
a
good
deal
further
from
boston
to
cambridge
than
it
is
from
cambridge
to
yes
said
pasmer
every
one
notices
dan
sat
absently
silent
for
a
time
before
he
said
yes
i
guess
i
must
go
out
and
see
yes
you
ought
she
very
fond
of
you
you
and
alice
ought
both
to
does
saintsbury
like
me
asked
dan
well
she
awfully
nice
do
you
think
she
awfully
fond
of
formulating
people
oh
everybody
in
cambridge
does
that
they
do
gossip
they
merely
accumulate
materials
for
the
formulation
of
and
they
get
there
just
the
same
cried
dan
mrs
saintsbury
used
to
think
she
had
got
me
down
pretty
fine
he
suggested
yes
said
pasmer
with
an
indifference
which
they
both
knew
she
did
not
feel
yes
she
used
to
accuse
me
of
preferring
to
tack
even
in
a
fair
he
looked
inquiringly
at
pasmer
and
she
said
how
ridiculous
yes
it
was
well
i
suppose
i
am
rather
circuitous
about
some
oh
not
at
all
and
i
suppose
i
rather
a
trial
to
alice
in
that
he
looked
at
pasmer
again
and
she
said
i
do
believe
you
are
in
the
least
you
ca
tell
what
is
trying
to
a
no
said
dan
pensively
i
pasmer
tried
to
render
the
interest
in
her
face
less
vivid
i
ca
tell
where
she
going
to
bring
up
talk
about
tacking
do
you
mean
the
abstract
girl
or
alice
oh
the
abstract
girl
said
dan
and
they
laughed
together
you
think
alice
is
very
straightforward
do
you
very
said
pasmer
looking
down
with
a
smile
for
a
yes
that
what
i
mean
and
do
you
think
the
most
circuitous
kind
of
fellow
would
be
pretty
direct
compared
with
the
kind
of
girl
there
was
a
rueful
defeat
and
bewilderment
in
dan
face
that
made
pasmer
laugh
what
has
she
been
doing
now
she
asked
mrs
pasmer
said
dan
you
and
i
are
the
only
frank
and
open
people
i
know
well
she
began
to
talk
last
night
about
influence
the
influence
of
other
people
on
us
and
she
killed
off
nearly
all
the
people
i
like
before
i
knew
what
she
was
up
to
and
she
finished
with
brinkley
i
glad
she
did
happen
to
think
of
you
pasmer
or
i
be
associating
with
you
at
the
present
this
idea
seemed
to
give
pasmer
inexpressible
pleasure
dan
went
on
do
you
quite
see
the
connection
between
our
being
entirely
devoted
to
each
other
and
my
dropping
brinkley
i
do
know
said
pasmer
alice
does
like
satirical
well
of
course
not
but
brinkley
is
such
an
admirer
of
i
dare
say
she
tells
you
oh
but
she
is
i
do
deny
it
said
pasmer
but
if
alice
feels
something
inimical
antipatico
in
her
atmosphere
it
no
use
oh
no
it
no
use
talking
and
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
after
a
pause
mavering
asked
mrs
pasmer
do
you
think
that
where
two
people
are
going
to
be
entirely
devoted
to
each
other
and
to
each
other
they
ought
to
divide
and
one
do
all
the
devotion
and
the
other
all
the
pasmer
was
amused
by
the
droll
look
in
dan
eyes
i
think
they
ought
to
be
willing
to
share
evenly
she
said
yes
that
what
i
say
share
and
share
alike
i
not
selfish
about
those
little
he
blew
off
a
long
sighing
breath
mrs
pasmer
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
an
ideal
of
conduct
pasmer
abandoned
herself
to
laughter
o
dan
dan
you
will
be
the
death
of
we
will
die
together
then
pasmer
alice
will
kill
he
regarded
her
with
a
sad
sympathy
in
his
eye
as
she
laughed
and
laughed
with
delicious
intelligence
of
the
case
the
intelligence
was
perfect
from
their
point
of
view
but
whether
it
fathomed
the
girl
whole
intention
or
aspiration
is
another
matter
perhaps
this
was
not
very
clear
to
herself
at
any
rate
mavering
did
not
go
any
more
to
see
brinkley
whose
house
he
had
liked
to
drop
into
alice
went
several
times
to
show
she
said
that
she
had
no
feeling
in
the
matter
and
brinkley
when
she
met
dan
forbore
to
embarrass
him
with
questions
or
reproaches
she
only
praised
alice
to
him
there
were
not
many
other
influences
that
alice
cut
him
off
from
she
even
exposed
him
to
some
influences
that
might
have
been
thought
deleterious
she
made
him
go
and
call
alone
upon
certain
young
ladies
whom
she
specified
and
she
praised
several
others
to
him
though
she
did
not
praise
them
for
the
same
things
that
he
did
one
of
them
was
a
girl
to
whom
alice
had
taken
a
great
fancy
such
as
often
buds
into
a
romantic
passion
between
women
she
was
very
gentle
and
mild
and
she
had
none
of
that
strength
of
will
which
she
admired
in
alice
one
night
there
was
a
sleighing
party
to
a
hotel
in
the
suburbs
where
they
had
dancing
and
then
supper
after
the
supper
they
danced
little
sally
waters
for
a
finale
instead
of
the
virginia
reel
and
alice
would
not
go
on
the
floor
with
dan
she
said
she
disliked
that
dance
but
she
told
him
to
dance
with
miss
langham
it
became
a
gale
of
fun
and
in
the
height
of
it
dan
slipped
and
fell
with
his
partner
they
laughed
it
off
with
the
rest
but
after
a
while
the
girl
began
to
cry
she
had
received
a
painful
bruise
all
the
way
home
while
the
others
laughed
and
sang
and
chattered
dan
was
troubled
about
this
poor
girl
his
anxiety
became
a
joke
with
the
whole
sleighful
of
people
when
he
parted
with
alice
at
her
door
he
said
i
afraid
i
hurt
miss
langham
i
feel
awfully
about
yes
there
no
doubt
of
that
good
night
she
left
him
to
go
off
to
his
lodging
hot
and
tingling
with
indignation
at
her
injustice
but
kindlier
thoughts
came
to
him
before
he
slept
and
he
fell
asleep
with
a
smile
of
tenderness
for
her
on
his
lips
he
could
see
how
he
was
wrong
to
go
out
with
any
one
else
when
alice
said
she
disliked
the
dance
he
ought
not
to
have
taken
advantage
of
her
generosity
in
appointing
him
a
partner
it
was
trying
for
her
to
see
him
make
that
ludicrous
tumble
of
course
and
perhaps
he
had
overdone
the
attentive
sympathy
on
the
way
home
it
flattered
him
that
she
could
not
help
showing
her
jealousy
that
is
flattering
at
first
and
dan
was
able
to
go
and
confess
all
but
this
to
alice
she
received
his
submission
magnanimously
and
said
that
she
was
glad
it
had
happened
because
his
saying
this
showed
that
now
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
then
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
and
said
i
just
been
round
to
see
lilly
and
she
as
well
as
ever
it
was
only
a
nervous
whether
mavering
was
really
indifferent
to
miss
langham
condition
or
whether
the
education
of
his
perceptions
had
gone
so
far
that
he
consciously
ignored
her
he
answered
that
was
splendid
of
you
no
she
said
it
you
that
are
splendid
and
you
always
are
oh
i
wonder
if
i
can
ever
be
worthy
of
you
their
mutual
forgiveness
was
very
sweet
to
them
and
they
went
on
praising
each
other
alice
suddenly
broke
away
from
this
weakening
exchange
of
worship
and
said
with
that
air
of
coming
to
business
which
he
lad
learned
to
recognise
and
dread
a
little
dan
do
you
think
i
ought
to
write
to
your
mother
write
to
my
mother
why
you
have
written
to
her
you
wrote
as
soon
as
you
got
back
and
she
answered
yes
but
write
regularly
show
that
i
think
of
her
all
the
time
when
i
really
think
i
going
to
take
you
from
her
i
seem
so
cruel
and
heartless
oh
i
do
look
at
it
in
that
light
do
joke
and
when
i
think
that
we
going
away
to
leave
her
for
several
years
perhaps
as
soon
as
we
married
i
ca
make
it
seem
right
i
know
how
she
depends
upon
your
being
near
her
and
seeing
her
every
now
and
then
and
to
go
off
to
europe
for
years
perhaps
of
course
you
can
be
of
use
to
your
father
there
but
do
you
think
right
toward
your
mother
i
want
you
to
dan
thought
but
his
thinking
was
mainly
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
know
what
she
was
driving
at
had
she
got
any
inkling
of
that
plan
of
his
mother
for
them
to
come
and
stay
a
year
or
two
at
the
falls
after
their
marriage
he
always
expected
to
be
able
to
reconcile
that
plan
with
the
pasmer
plan
of
going
at
once
to
his
optimism
the
two
were
not
really
incompatible
but
he
did
not
wish
them
prematurely
confronted
in
alice
mind
was
this
her
way
of
letting
him
know
that
she
knew
what
his
mother
wished
and
that
she
was
willing
to
make
the
sacrifice
or
was
it
just
some
vague
longing
to
please
him
by
a
show
of
affection
toward
his
family
an
unmeditated
impulse
of
reparation
he
had
an
impulse
himself
to
be
frank
with
alice
to
take
her
at
her
word
and
to
allow
that
he
did
not
like
the
notion
of
going
abroad
this
was
notion
of
being
frank
he
could
still
reserve
the
fact
that
he
had
given
his
mother
a
tacit
promise
to
bring
alice
home
to
live
but
he
postponed
even
this
he
said
oh
i
guess
that
be
all
right
alice
at
any
rate
there
no
need
to
think
about
it
yet
awhile
that
can
be
yes
said
alice
but
do
you
think
i
better
get
into
the
habit
of
writing
regularly
to
your
mother
now
so
that
there
need
be
any
break
when
we
go
abroad
he
could
see
now
that
she
had
no
idea
of
giving
that
plan
up
and
he
was
glad
that
he
had
not
said
anything
i
think
she
continued
that
i
shall
write
to
her
once
a
week
and
give
her
a
full
account
of
our
life
from
day
to
day
it
be
more
like
a
diary
and
then
when
we
get
over
there
i
can
keep
it
up
without
any
effort
and
she
wo
feel
so
much
that
you
she
seemed
to
refer
the
plan
to
him
and
he
said
it
was
capital
in
fact
he
did
like
the
notion
of
a
diary
that
sort
of
historical
view
would
involve
less
danger
of
precipitating
a
discussion
of
the
two
schemes
of
life
for
the
future
it
awfully
kind
of
you
alice
to
propose
such
a
thing
and
you
must
make
it
a
burden
any
sort
of
little
sketchy
record
will
do
mother
can
read
between
the
lines
you
it
wo
be
a
burden
said
the
girl
tenderly
i
shall
seem
to
be
doing
it
for
your
mother
but
i
know
i
shall
be
doing
it
for
you
i
do
everything
for
you
do
you
think
it
right
oh
it
must
be
said
dan
laughing
it
so
oh
said
the
girl
gloomily
that
what
makes
me
doubt
xlii
eunice
mavering
acknowledged
alice
first
letter
she
said
that
her
mother
read
it
aloud
to
them
all
and
had
been
delighted
with
the
good
account
she
gave
of
dan
and
fascinated
with
all
the
story
of
their
daily
doings
and
sayings
she
wished
eunice
to
tell
alice
how
fully
she
appreciated
her
thoughtfulness
of
a
sick
old
woman
and
that
she
was
going
to
write
herself
and
thank
her
but
eunice
added
that
alice
must
not
be
surprised
if
her
mother
was
not
very
prompt
in
this
and
she
sent
messages
from
all
the
family
affectionate
for
alice
and
polite
for
her
father
and
mother
alice
showed
dan
the
letter
and
he
seemed
to
find
nothing
noticeable
in
it
she
says
your
mother
will
write
later
alice
suggested
yes
you
ought
to
feel
very
much
complimented
by
that
autographs
are
pretty
uncommon
he
said
smiling
why
does
she
write
ca
she
does
it
tire
her
asked
alice
oh
yes
she
can
write
but
she
hates
to
she
gets
eunice
or
minnie
to
write
dan
cried
alice
intensely
why
did
you
tell
me
why
i
thought
you
knew
it
he
explained
easily
she
likes
to
read
and
likes
to
talk
but
it
bores
her
to
write
i
do
suppose
i
get
more
than
two
or
three
pencil
scratches
from
her
in
the
course
of
a
year
she
makes
the
girls
write
but
you
need
mind
her
not
writing
you
may
be
sure
she
glad
of
your
it
makes
me
seem
very
presumptuous
to
be
writing
to
her
when
there
no
chance
of
her
answering
alice
grieved
it
as
if
i
had
passed
over
your
sisters
heads
i
ought
to
have
written
to
oh
well
you
can
do
that
now
said
dan
soothingly
no
no
i
ca
do
it
now
it
would
be
she
was
silent
and
presently
she
asked
is
there
anything
else
about
your
mother
that
i
ought
to
know
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
impending
discipline
in
her
eyes
which
he
had
learned
to
dread
it
meant
such
a
long
course
of
things
such
a
very
great
variety
of
atonement
and
expiation
for
him
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
confront
it
steadily
his
heart
gave
a
feeble
leap
he
would
have
gladly
told
her
all
that
was
in
it
and
he
meant
to
do
so
at
the
right
time
but
this
did
not
seem
the
moment
i
ca
say
that
there
is
he
answered
coldly
in
that
need
of
consecrating
her
happiness
which
alice
felt
she
went
a
great
deal
to
church
in
those
days
sometimes
she
felt
the
need
almost
of
defence
against
her
happiness
and
a
vague
apprehension
mixed
with
it
could
it
be
right
to
let
it
claim
her
whole
being
as
it
seemed
to
do
than
was
the
question
which
she
once
asked
dan
and
it
made
him
laugh
and
catch
her
to
him
in
a
rapture
that
served
for
the
time
and
then
left
her
to
more
morbid
doubts
evidently
he
could
not
follow
her
in
them
he
could
not
even
imagine
them
and
while
he
was
with
her
they
seemed
to
have
no
verity
or
value
but
she
talked
them
over
very
hypothetically
and
impersonally
with
miss
cotton
in
whose
sympathy
they
resumed
all
their
import
and
gained
something
more
in
the
idealisation
which
the
girl
underwent
in
this
atmosphere
all
her
thoughts
and
purposes
had
a
significance
which
she
would
not
of
herself
perhaps
have
attached
to
them
they
discussed
them
and
analysed
them
with
a
satisfaction
in
the
result
which
could
not
be
represented
without
an
effect
of
caricature
they
measured
alice
romance
together
and
evolved
from
it
a
sublimation
of
responsibility
of
duty
of
devotion
which
alice
found
it
impossible
to
submit
to
dan
when
he
came
with
his
purpose
of
getting
pasmer
out
of
the
room
and
sitting
down
with
his
arm
around
alice
waist
when
he
had
accomplished
this
it
seemed
sufficient
in
itself
and
she
had
to
think
to
struggle
to
recall
things
beyond
it
above
it
he
could
not
be
made
to
see
at
such
times
how
their
lives
could
be
more
in
unison
than
they
were
when
she
proposed
doing
something
for
him
which
he
knew
was
disagreeable
to
her
he
would
not
let
her
and
when
she
hinted
at
anything
she
wished
him
to
do
for
her
because
she
knew
it
was
disagreeable
to
him
he
consented
so
promptly
so
joyously
that
she
perceived
he
could
not
have
given
the
least
thought
to
it
she
felt
every
day
that
they
were
alien
in
their
tastes
and
aims
their
pleasures
were
not
the
same
and
though
it
was
sweet
though
it
was
charming
to
have
him
give
up
so
willingly
all
his
preferences
she
felt
without
knowing
that
the
time
must
come
when
this
could
not
be
so
that
it
was
all
wrong
but
these
very
differences
these
antagonisms
if
you
wish
to
call
them
so
suggested
miss
cotton
in
talking
alice
misgivings
over
with
her
are
they
just
what
will
draw
you
together
more
and
more
it
what
attracted
you
to
each
other
the
very
fact
that
you
are
such
perfect
counterparts
yes
the
girl
assented
that
what
we
taught
to
she
meant
by
the
novels
to
which
we
all
trust
our
instruction
in
such
matters
and
her
doubt
doubly
rankled
after
she
had
put
it
to
silence
she
kept
on
writing
to
dan
mother
though
more
and
more
perfunctorily
and
now
eunice
and
now
minnie
mavering
acknowledged
her
letters
she
knew
that
they
must
think
she
was
silly
but
having
entered
by
connivance
upon
her
folly
she
was
too
proud
to
abandon
it
at
last
after
she
had
ceased
to
expect
it
came
a
letter
from
his
mother
not
a
brief
note
but
a
letter
which
the
invalid
had
evidently
tasked
herself
to
make
long
and
full
in
recognition
of
alice
kindness
in
writing
to
her
so
much
the
girl
opened
it
and
after
a
verifying
glance
at
the
signature
began
to
read
it
with
a
thrill
of
tender
triumph
and
the
fond
prevision
of
the
greater
pleasure
of
reading
it
again
with
dan
but
after
reading
it
once
through
she
did
not
wait
for
him
before
reading
it
again
and
again
she
did
this
with
bewilderment
intershot
with
flashes
of
conviction
and
then
doubts
of
this
conviction
when
she
could
misunderstand
no
longer
she
rose
quietly
and
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
carefully
back
into
its
envelope
and
into
her
writing
desk
where
she
sat
down
and
wrote
in
her
clearest
and
firmest
hand
this
note
to
mavering
i
wish
to
see
you
immediately
alice
xliii
dan
had
learned
with
a
lover
keenness
to
read
alice
moods
in
the
most
colourless
wording
of
her
notes
she
was
rather
apt
to
write
him
notes
taking
back
or
reaffirming
the
effect
of
something
that
had
just
passed
between
them
her
note
were
tempered
to
varying
degrees
of
heat
and
cold
so
fine
that
no
one
else
would
have
felt
the
difference
but
sensible
to
him
in
their
subtlest
intention
perhaps
a
mere
witness
of
the
fact
would
have
been
alarmed
by
a
note
which
began
without
an
address
except
that
on
the
envelope
and
ended
its
peremptory
brevity
with
the
writer
name
signed
in
full
dan
read
calamity
in
it
and
he
had
all
the
more
trouble
to
pull
himself
together
to
meet
it
because
he
had
parted
with
unusual
tenderness
from
alice
the
night
before
after
an
evening
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
that
their
ideals
had
been
completely
reconciled
the
note
came
as
her
notes
were
apt
to
come
while
dan
was
at
breakfast
which
he
was
rather
luxurious
about
for
so
young
a
man
and
he
felt
formlessly
glad
afterward
that
he
had
drunk
his
first
cup
of
coffee
before
he
opened
it
for
it
chilled
the
second
cup
and
seemed
to
take
all
character
out
of
the
omelet
he
obeyed
it
wondering
what
the
doom
menaced
in
it
might
be
but
knowing
that
it
was
doom
and
leaving
his
breakfast
with
a
dull
sense
of
the
tragedy
of
doing
so
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
for
pasmer
first
and
interpose
a
moment
of
her
cheerful
unreality
between
himself
and
his
interview
with
alice
but
he
decided
that
he
had
better
not
do
this
and
they
met
at
once
with
the
width
of
the
room
between
them
her
look
was
one
that
made
it
impassable
to
the
simple
impulse
he
usually
had
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
but
as
she
stood
holding
out
a
letter
to
him
with
the
apparent
intention
that
he
should
come
and
take
it
he
traversed
the
intervening
space
and
took
it
why
it
from
mother
he
said
joyously
with
a
glance
at
the
handwriting
will
you
please
explain
it
said
alice
and
dan
began
to
read
it
it
began
with
a
good
many
excuses
for
not
having
written
before
and
went
on
with
a
pretty
expression
of
interest
in
alice
letters
and
gratitude
for
them
mavering
assured
the
girl
that
she
could
not
imagine
what
a
pleasure
they
had
been
to
her
she
promised
herself
that
they
should
be
great
friends
and
she
said
that
she
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
time
now
drawing
near
when
dan
should
bring
her
home
to
them
she
said
she
knew
alice
would
find
it
dull
at
the
falls
except
for
him
but
they
would
all
do
their
best
and
she
would
find
the
place
very
different
from
what
she
had
seen
it
in
the
winter
alice
could
make
believe
that
she
was
there
just
for
the
summer
and
mavering
hoped
that
before
the
summer
was
gone
she
would
be
so
sorry
for
a
sick
old
woman
that
she
would
not
even
wish
to
go
with
it
this
part
of
the
letter
which
gave
dan
away
so
hopelessly
as
he
felt
was
phrased
so
touchingly
that
he
looked
up
from
it
with
moist
eyes
to
the
hard
cold
judgment
in
the
eyes
of
alice
will
you
please
explain
it
she
repeated
he
tried
to
temporise
explain
what
alice
was
prompt
to
say
had
you
promised
your
mother
to
take
me
home
to
live
dan
did
not
answer
you
promised
my
mother
to
go
abroad
what
else
have
you
promised
he
continued
silent
and
she
added
you
are
a
faithless
they
were
the
words
of
romola
in
the
romance
to
tito
she
had
often
admired
them
and
they
seemed
to
her
equally
the
measure
of
dan
offence
alice
here
are
your
letters
and
remembrances
dan
mechanically
received
the
packet
she
had
been
holding
behind
her
with
a
perverse
freak
of
intelligence
he
observed
that
though
much
larger
now
it
was
tied
up
with
the
same
ribbon
which
had
fastened
it
when
alice
returned
his
letters
and
gifts
before
i
wish
you
every
happiness
consistent
with
your
she
bowed
coldly
and
was
about
to
leave
him
as
she
had
planned
but
she
had
not
arranged
that
he
should
be
standing
in
front
of
the
door
and
he
was
there
with
no
apparent
intention
of
moving
will
you
allow
me
to
pass
she
was
forced
to
ask
however
haughtily
no
he
retorted
with
a
violence
that
surprised
him
i
will
not
let
you
pass
till
you
have
listened
to
me
till
you
tell
me
why
you
treat
me
so
i
wo
stand
it
i
had
enough
of
this
kind
of
it
surprised
alice
too
a
little
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
said
i
will
listen
to
you
so
much
more
gently
than
she
had
spoken
before
that
dan
relaxed
his
imperative
tone
and
began
to
laugh
but
she
added
and
her
face
clouded
again
it
will
be
of
no
use
my
mind
is
made
up
this
time
why
should
we
talk
why
because
mine
is
said
dan
what
is
the
matter
alice
do
you
think
i
would
force
you
or
even
ask
you
to
go
home
with
me
to
live
unless
you
were
entirely
willing
it
could
only
be
a
temporary
arrangement
that
is
the
question
she
retorted
the
question
is
whether
promised
your
mother
one
thing
and
me
well
i
do
know
about
promising
said
dan
laughing
a
little
more
uneasily
but
still
laughing
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
i
consulted
about
the
matter
your
mother
proposed
one
thing
and
my
mother
proposed
and
you
agreed
to
both
that
is
quite
enough
quite
characteristic
dan
flushed
and
stopped
laughing
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
characteristic
the
thing
did
have
to
be
decided
at
once
and
i
did
suppose
it
would
be
difficult
for
either
side
to
give
way
if
it
was
judged
best
i
was
sure
my
mother
would
it
seems
very
easy
for
your
family
to
make
sacrifices
that
are
not
likely
to
be
required
of
you
must
criticise
my
mother
cried
dan
i
have
not
criticised
her
you
insinuate
that
we
would
be
too
selfish
to
give
up
if
it
were
for
the
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
and
unless
you
are
determined
to
quarrel
with
me
you
would
say
i
do
wish
a
quarrel
none
is
necessary
said
alice
coldly
you
accuse
me
of
being
treacherous
i
did
say
treacherous
faithless
then
it
a
mere
quibble
about
words
i
want
you
to
take
that
i
ca
take
it
back
it
the
truth
are
you
faithless
if
you
let
us
go
on
thinking
that
you
going
to
europe
and
let
your
mother
think
that
we
coming
home
to
live
after
we
married
no
i
simply
leaving
the
question
open
yes
said
the
girl
sadly
you
like
to
leave
questions
open
your
well
i
suppose
i
do
till
it
necessary
to
decide
them
it
saves
the
needless
effusion
of
talk
said
dan
with
a
laugh
and
then
as
people
do
in
a
quarrel
he
went
back
to
his
angry
mood
and
said
besides
i
supposed
you
would
be
glad
of
the
chance
to
make
some
sacrifice
for
me
you
always
asking
for
thank
you
mavering
said
alice
for
reminding
me
of
it
nothing
is
sacred
to
you
it
seems
i
ca
say
that
you
have
ever
sought
any
opportunities
of
i
was
allowed
time
to
do
so
they
were
always
thank
you
again
mavering
all
this
is
quite
a
revelation
i
glad
to
know
how
you
really
felt
about
things
that
you
seemed
so
eager
alice
you
know
that
i
would
do
anything
for
you
cried
dan
rueing
his
precipitate
words
yes
that
what
you
repeatedly
told
me
i
used
to
believe
and
i
always
believed
what
you
said
you
said
at
the
picnic
that
day
that
you
thought
i
would
like
to
live
at
ponkwasset
falls
if
my
business
was
there
that
is
not
the
point
and
now
you
quarrel
with
me
because
my
mother
wishes
me
to
do
alice
merely
said
i
do
know
why
i
stand
here
allowing
you
to
intimidate
me
in
my
father
house
i
demand
that
you
shall
stand
aside
and
let
me
i
not
oblige
you
to
leave
the
room
said
dan
i
will
go
but
if
i
go
you
will
understand
that
i
do
come
i
hope
that
said
the
girl
very
well
good
morning
miss
she
inclined
her
head
slightly
in
acknowledgment
of
his
bow
and
he
whirled
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
dim
narrow
passageway
into
the
arms
of
pasmer
who
had
resisted
as
long
as
she
could
her
curiosity
to
know
what
the
angry
voices
of
himself
and
alice
meant
o
mavering
is
it
you
she
buzzed
and
she
flung
aside
one
pretence
for
another
in
adding
could
alice
make
you
stay
to
breakfast
dan
felt
a
rush
of
tenderness
in
his
heart
at
the
sound
of
the
kind
humbugging
little
voice
no
thank
you
pasmer
i
could
stay
thank
you
i
i
thank
you
very
much
i
he
wrung
her
hand
and
found
his
way
out
of
the
apartment
door
leaving
her
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
his
flight
and
his
broken
words
as
she
could
alice
she
said
as
she
entered
the
room
where
the
girl
had
remained
what
have
you
been
doing
now
oh
nothing
she
said
with
a
remnant
of
her
scorn
for
dan
qualifying
her
tone
and
manner
to
her
mother
i
dismissed
then
you
want
him
to
come
to
lunch
asked
her
mother
i
should
advise
him
to
i
do
think
he
accept
said
alice
then
as
pasmer
stood
in
the
door
preventing
her
egress
as
dan
had
done
before
she
asked
meekly
will
you
let
me
pass
mamma
my
head
pasmer
whose
easy
triumphs
in
so
many
difficult
circumstances
kept
her
nearly
always
in
good
temper
let
herself
go
at
these
words
in
vexation
very
uncommon
with
her
indeed
i
shall
not
she
retorted
and
you
will
please
sit
down
here
and
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
dismissing
mavering
i
tired
of
your
whims
and
i
ca
talk
began
the
girl
stubbornly
yes
i
think
you
can
said
her
mother
at
any
rate
i
can
now
what
is
it
all
perhaps
this
letter
will
explain
said
alice
continuing
to
dignify
her
enforced
submission
with
a
tone
of
unabated
hauteur
and
she
gave
her
mother
mavering
letter
which
dan
had
mechanically
restored
to
her
pasmer
read
it
not
only
without
indignation
but
apparently
without
displeasure
but
she
understood
perfectly
what
the
trouble
was
when
she
looked
up
and
asked
cheerfully
well
well
repeated
alice
with
a
frown
of
astonishment
do
you
see
that
he
promised
us
one
thing
and
her
another
and
that
he
false
to
both
i
do
know
said
pasmer
recovering
her
in
view
of
a
situation
that
she
felt
herself
able
to
cope
with
of
course
he
has
to
temporise
to
manage
a
little
she
an
invalid
and
of
course
very
exacting
he
has
to
humour
her
how
do
you
know
he
has
promised
her
he
has
promised
has
promised
us
alice
gasped
no
he
simply
fallen
in
with
what
we
said
it
because
so
sweet
and
yielding
and
ca
bear
to
refuse
i
can
understand
it
then
if
he
has
promised
us
he
deceived
us
all
the
more
shamefully
for
he
made
us
think
he
he
has
me
said
pasmer
smiling
at
the
stormy
virtue
in
her
daughter
face
and
what
if
you
should
go
home
awhile
with
him
for
the
summer
say
it
could
last
longer
much
and
it
would
hurt
us
to
wait
i
suppose
he
hoped
for
something
of
that
oh
it
is
that
groaned
the
girl
in
a
kind
of
bewilderment
i
could
have
gone
there
with
him
joyfully
and
lived
all
my
days
if
only
been
frank
with
oh
no
you
could
said
her
mother
with
cosy
security
when
it
comes
to
it
you
do
like
giving
up
any
more
than
other
people
very
hard
for
you
to
give
up
he
sees
that
he
knows
it
and
he
really
like
to
ask
any
sort
of
sacrifice
from
you
he
afraid
of
do
i
know
that
demanded
alice
desolately
i
known
it
from
the
first
and
i
felt
it
all
the
time
it
all
a
mistake
and
has
been
we
never
could
understand
each
other
we
too
that
need
prevent
you
understanding
him
it
need
prevent
you
from
seeing
how
really
kind
and
good
he
is
how
faithful
and
constant
he
oh
you
say
that
you
praise
him
because
you
like
of
course
i
do
and
ca
you
no
the
least
grain
of
deceit
of
temporising
you
call
it
spoils
everything
it
over
said
the
girl
rising
with
a
sigh
from
the
chair
she
had
dropped
into
we
best
apart
we
could
only
have
been
wretched
and
wicked
what
did
you
say
to
him
alice
asked
her
mother
unshaken
by
her
rhetoric
i
told
him
he
was
a
faithless
then
you
were
a
cruel
girl
cried
pasmer
with
sudden
indignation
and
if
you
were
not
my
daughter
i
could
be
glad
he
had
escaped
you
i
do
know
where
you
got
all
those
silly
romantic
notions
of
yours
about
these
things
you
certainly
did
get
them
from
me
she
continued
with
undeniable
truth
and
i
do
believe
you
get
them
from
your
church
it
just
as
miss
anderson
said
your
church
makes
allowance
for
human
nature
but
you
make
i
should
go
to
julia
anderson
for
instruction
in
such
matters
said
the
girl
with
cold
resentment
i
wish
you
would
go
to
her
for
a
little
commonsense
or
somebody
said
pasmer
do
you
know
what
talk
this
will
make
i
do
care
for
the
talk
it
would
be
worse
than
talk
to
marry
a
man
whom
i
could
trust
who
wanted
to
please
me
so
much
that
he
had
to
deceive
me
and
was
too
much
afraid
of
me
to
tell
me
the
you
headstrong
girl
said
her
mother
impartially
admiring
at
the
same
time
the
girl
haughty
beauty
there
was
an
argument
in
reserve
in
pasmer
mind
which
perhaps
none
but
an
american
mother
would
have
hesitated
to
urge
but
it
is
so
wholly
our
tradition
to
treat
the
important
business
of
marriage
as
a
romantic
episode
that
even
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
insist
that
her
daughter
should
not
throw
away
a
chance
so
advantageous
from
every
worldly
point
of
view
she
could
only
ask
if
you
break
this
engagement
what
do
you
expect
to
do
the
engagement
is
broken
i
shall
go
into
a
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
with
my
consent
said
pasmer
i
will
have
no
such
nonsense
do
flatter
yourself
that
i
will
even
if
i
approved
of
such
a
thing
i
should
think
it
wicked
to
let
you
do
it
you
always
fancying
yourself
doing
something
very
devoted
but
never
seen
you
ready
to
give
up
your
own
will
or
your
own
comfort
even
in
the
slightest
degree
and
dan
mavering
if
he
were
twice
as
temporising
and
circuitous
the
word
came
to
her
from
her
talk
with
him
would
be
twice
too
good
for
you
i
going
to
xliv
the
difficulty
in
life
is
to
bring
experience
to
the
level
of
expectation
to
match
our
real
emotions
in
view
of
any
great
occasion
with
the
ideal
emotions
which
we
have
taught
ourselves
that
we
ought
to
feel
this
is
all
the
truer
when
the
occasion
is
tragical
we
surprise
ourselves
in
a
helplessness
to
which
the
great
event
death
ruin
lost
love
reveals
itself
slowly
and
at
first
wears
the
aspect
of
an
unbroken
continuance
of
what
has
been
or
at
most
of
another
incident
in
the
habitual
sequence
dan
mavering
came
out
into
the
bright
winter
morning
knowing
that
his
engagement
was
broken
but
feeling
it
so
little
that
he
could
not
believe
it
he
failed
to
realise
it
to
seize
it
for
a
fact
and
he
could
not
let
it
remain
that
dumb
and
formless
wretchedness
without
proportion
or
dimensions
which
it
now
seemed
to
be
weighing
his
life
down
to
verify
it
to
begin
to
outlive
it
he
must
instantly
impart
it
he
must
tell
it
he
must
see
it
with
others
eyes
this
was
the
necessity
of
his
youth
and
of
his
sympathy
which
included
himself
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
race
in
its
activity
he
had
the
usual
environment
of
a
young
man
who
has
money
he
belonged
to
clubs
and
he
had
a
large
acquaintance
among
men
of
his
own
age
who
lived
a
life
of
greater
leisure
or
were
more
absorbed
in
business
but
whom
he
met
constantly
in
society
for
one
reason
or
another
or
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
was
dan
mavering
and
liked
every
one
he
liked
them
all
he
thought
himself
great
friends
with
them
he
dined
and
lunched
with
them
and
they
knew
the
pasmers
and
all
about
his
engagement
but
he
did
not
go
to
any
of
them
now
with
the
need
he
felt
to
impart
his
calamity
to
get
the
support
of
come
other
credence
and
opinion
of
it
he
went
to
a
friend
whom
in
the
way
of
his
world
he
met
very
seldom
but
whom
he
always
found
as
he
said
just
where
he
had
left
him
boardman
never
made
any
sign
of
suspecting
that
he
was
put
on
and
off
according
to
dan
necessity
or
desire
for
comfort
or
congratulation
but
it
was
part
of
their
joke
that
dan
coming
to
him
always
meant
something
decisive
in
his
experiences
the
reporter
was
at
his
late
breakfast
which
his
landlady
furnished
him
in
his
room
though
as
mash
said
she
never
gave
meals
but
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
egg
or
two
yes
well
he
said
without
looking
up
well
i
done
for
cried
dan
again
asked
boardman
again
the
other
time
was
nothing
boardman
i
knew
it
was
anything
but
this
this
is
go
on
said
boardman
looking
about
for
his
individual
which
he
found
under
the
edge
of
his
plate
and
mavering
laid
the
whole
case
before
him
as
he
made
no
comment
on
it
for
a
while
dan
was
obliged
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
it
well
he
said
with
the
smile
that
showed
the
evenness
of
his
pretty
teeth
there
a
kind
of
wild
justice
in
he
admitted
this
with
the
object
of
meeting
views
in
an
opinion
so
you
think
i
a
faithless
man
too
do
you
demanded
mavering
stormily
not
from
your
point
of
view
said
boardman
who
kept
on
quietly
eating
and
drinking
mavering
was
too
amiable
not
to
feel
boardman
innocence
of
offence
in
his
unperturbed
behaviour
there
was
no
faithlessness
about
it
and
you
know
it
he
went
on
half
laughing
half
crying
in
his
excitement
and
making
boardman
the
avenue
of
an
appeal
really
addressed
to
alice
i
was
ready
to
do
what
either
side
or
both
suggested
boardman
yes
or
both
said
dan
boldly
accepting
the
suggestion
it
have
cost
me
a
pang
to
give
up
if
i
been
in
the
place
of
i
guess
that
what
she
could
never
understand
boardman
mused
aloud
and
i
could
never
understand
how
any
one
could
fail
to
see
that
that
was
what
i
intended
expected
that
it
would
all
come
out
right
of
itself
dan
was
still
addressing
alice
in
this
belated
reasoning
but
to
be
accused
of
bad
faith
of
trying
to
deceive
any
one
pretty
rough
said
boardman
rough
it
more
than
i
can
stand
well
you
do
seem
to
be
asked
to
stand
it
said
boardman
and
mavering
laughed
forlornly
with
him
at
his
joke
and
then
walked
away
and
looked
out
of
boardman
on
the
roofs
below
with
their
dirty
february
snow
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
face
with
it
when
he
turned
round
boardman
looked
keenly
at
him
and
asked
with
an
air
of
caution
and
so
all
up
yes
it
all
up
said
dan
hoarsely
no
danger
of
a
relapse
what
do
you
mean
no
danger
of
having
my
sympathy
handed
over
later
to
miss
pasmer
for
examination
i
guess
you
can
speak
up
freely
boardman
said
dan
if
that
what
you
mean
miss
pasmer
and
i
are
well
then
i
glad
of
it
she
was
the
one
for
you
she
is
fit
for
what
the
reason
she
is
cried
dan
she
the
most
beautiful
and
noble
girl
in
the
world
and
the
most
conscientious
and
the
best
if
she
is
unjust
to
no
doubt
of
that
i
not
attacking
her
and
i
not
defending
what
are
you
doing
then
simply
saying
that
i
do
believe
you
two
would
ever
understand
each
other
you
have
got
the
same
point
of
view
and
you
could
make
it
go
both
out
of
a
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
a
scrape
said
dan
resenting
the
word
more
than
the
idea
boardman
tacitly
refused
to
modify
or
withdraw
it
and
dan
said
after
a
sulky
silence
in
which
he
began
to
dramatise
a
meeting
with
his
family
i
going
home
i
ca
stand
it
here
the
reason
you
ca
come
with
me
boardman
do
you
mean
to
your
rooms
no
to
the
thanks
guess
why
not
do
care
about
being
a
fifth
oh
pshaw
now
boardman
look
here
you
must
go
i
want
you
to
go
i
i
want
your
support
that
it
i
all
broken
up
and
i
stand
that
three
hours
pull
alone
they
be
glad
to
see
you
all
of
them
do
you
suppose
they
be
glad
to
see
you
they
always
glad
and
they
i
do
believe
you
want
me
to
go
yourself
you
just
think
you
no
i
really
do
want
you
boardman
i
want
to
talk
it
over
with
you
i
do
want
you
i
not
do
think
i
could
get
yet
he
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
the
notion
of
the
falls
it
made
him
smile
well
see
said
mavering
disconsolately
i
going
round
to
my
rooms
now
and
i
be
there
till
two
train
at
he
went
towards
the
door
where
he
faced
about
and
you
do
think
it
would
be
of
any
use
any
use
what
trying
to
to
to
make
it
how
should
i
know
no
no
of
course
you
could
said
dan
miserably
downcast
all
the
resentment
which
alice
injustice
had
roused
in
him
had
died
out
he
was
suffering
as
helplessly
and
hopelessly
as
a
child
well
he
sighed
as
he
swung
out
of
the
door
boardman
found
him
seated
at
his
in
his
when
he
came
to
him
rather
early
and
on
the
desk
were
laid
out
the
properties
of
the
little
play
which
had
come
to
a
tragic
close
there
were
some
small
bits
of
jewellery
among
the
rest
a
ring
of
hers
which
alice
had
been
letting
him
wear
a
lock
of
her
hair
which
he
had
kept
for
the
greater
convenience
of
kissing
in
the
original
parcel
tied
with
crimson
ribbon
a
succession
of
flowers
which
she
had
worn
more
and
more
dry
and
brown
with
age
one
of
her
gloves
which
he
had
found
and
kept
from
the
day
they
first
met
in
cambridge
a
bunch
of
withered
bluebells
tied
with
whose
odour
filled
the
room
from
the
picnic
at
campobello
scraps
of
paper
with
her
writing
on
them
and
cards
several
photographs
of
her
and
piles
of
notes
and
letters
look
here
said
dan
knowing
it
was
boardman
without
turning
round
what
am
i
to
do
about
these
things
boardman
respectfully
examined
them
over
his
shoulder
do
know
what
the
usual
ceremony
is
he
said
he
ventured
to
add
referring
to
the
heaps
of
letters
seems
to
have
been
rather
epistolary
does
she
oh
do
talk
of
her
as
if
she
were
dead
cried
dan
i
been
feeling
as
if
she
all
at
once
he
dropped
his
head
among
these
witnesses
of
his
loss
and
sobbed
boardman
appeared
shocked
and
yet
somewhat
amused
he
made
a
soft
low
sibilation
between
his
teeth
dan
lifted
his
head
boardman
if
you
ever
give
me
away
oh
i
do
suppose
it
very
hilarious
said
boardman
with
vague
kindness
packed
yet
he
asked
getting
away
from
the
subject
as
something
he
did
not
feel
himself
fitted
to
deal
with
consecutively
i
only
going
to
take
a
bag
said
mavering
going
to
get
some
clothes
down
from
a
closet
where
his
words
had
a
sepulchral
reverberation
ca
i
help
asked
boardman
keeping
away
from
the
sad
memorials
of
dan
love
strewn
about
on
the
desk
and
yet
not
able
to
keep
his
eyes
off
them
across
the
room
well
i
do
know
said
dan
he
came
out
with
his
armful
of
coats
and
trousers
and
threw
them
on
the
bed
are
you
going
if
i
could
believe
you
wanted
me
good
cried
mavering
and
the
fact
seemed
to
brighten
him
immediately
if
you
want
to
stuff
these
things
in
while
i
doing
up
these
other
he
nodded
his
head
toward
the
desk
all
right
said
boardman
his
burst
of
grief
must
have
relieved
dan
greatly
he
set
about
gathering
up
the
relics
on
the
desk
and
getting
a
suitable
piece
of
paper
to
wrap
them
in
he
rejected
several
pieces
as
inappropriate
i
do
know
what
kind
of
paper
to
do
these
things
up
in
he
said
at
last
any
special
kind
of
paper
required
boardman
asked
pausing
in
the
act
of
folding
a
pair
of
pantaloons
so
as
not
to
break
the
fall
over
the
boot
i
did
know
there
was
but
there
seems
to
be
said
dan
silver
paper
seems
to
be
rather
more
for
cake
and
that
sort
of
thing
suggested
boardman
kind
of
mourning
too
is
it
silver
i
do
know
said
dan
but
i
have
got
any
silver
newspaper
would
do
well
hardly
boardman
said
dan
with
sarcasm
well
said
boardman
i
should
have
supposed
that
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
to
send
back
a
lot
of
but
the
question
of
paper
seems
insuperable
manila
paper
would
do
either
and
then
comes
string
what
kind
of
string
are
you
going
to
tie
it
up
with
well
we
wo
start
that
question
till
we
get
to
it
answered
dan
looking
about
if
i
could
find
some
kind
of
a
box
have
you
got
a
collar
box
be
the
very
thing
boardman
had
gone
back
to
the
coats
and
trousers
abandoning
dan
to
the
subtler
difficulties
in
which
he
was
involved
they
all
got
labels
said
mavering
getting
down
one
marked
the
tennyson
and
another
lettered
the
clarion
and
looking
at
them
with
cold
rejection
do
see
how
you
going
to
send
these
things
back
at
all
then
have
to
keep
them
i
boardman
finished
his
task
and
came
back
to
dan
i
guess
i
got
it
now
said
mavering
lifting
the
lid
of
his
desk
and
taking
out
a
large
stiff
envelope
in
which
a
set
of
photographic
views
had
come
seems
to
have
been
made
for
it
boardman
exulted
watching
the
envelope
as
it
filled
up
expand
into
a
kind
of
shapely
packet
dan
put
the
things
silently
in
and
sealed
the
parcel
with
his
ring
then
he
turned
it
over
to
address
it
but
the
writing
of
alice
name
for
this
purpose
seemed
too
much
for
him
in
spite
of
boardman
humorous
support
throughout
oh
i
ca
do
it
he
said
falling
back
in
his
chair
let
me
said
his
friend
cheerfully
ignoring
his
despair
he
philosophised
the
whole
transaction
as
he
addressed
the
package
rang
for
a
messenger
and
sent
it
away
telling
him
to
call
a
cab
for
ten
minutes
past
two
mighty
good
thing
in
life
that
we
move
by
steps
now
on
the
stage
or
in
a
novel
you
have
got
those
things
together
and
addressed
and
despatched
in
just
the
right
kind
of
paper
with
just
the
right
kind
of
string
round
it
at
a
dash
and
then
you
have
had
time
to
go
up
and
lean
your
head
against
something
and
soliloquise
or
else
think
unutterable
things
but
here
you
see
how
a
merciful
providence
blocks
your
way
all
along
you
had
to
fight
through
all
sort
of
sordid
little
details
to
the
grand
tragic
result
of
getting
off
miss
letters
and
when
you
reach
it
you
do
mind
it
a
do
i
demanded
dan
in
as
hollow
a
voice
as
he
could
you
joke
at
a
funeral
i
seen
some
pretty
cheerful
funerals
said
boardman
and
it
this
principle
of
steps
of
degrees
of
having
to
do
this
little
thing
and
that
little
thing
that
keeps
funerals
from
killing
the
survivors
i
suppose
this
is
worse
than
a
funeral
look
at
it
in
the
right
light
you
mourn
as
one
without
hope
do
you
live
through
it
too
i
he
made
dan
help
get
the
rest
of
his
things
into
his
bag
and
with
one
little
artifice
and
another
prevented
him
from
stagnating
in
despair
he
dissented
from
the
idea
of
waiting
over
another
day
to
see
if
alice
would
not
relent
when
she
got
her
letters
back
and
send
for
dan
to
come
and
see
her
relent
a
good
deal
more
when
she
finds
you
gone
out
of
town
if
she
sends
for
you
he
argued
and
he
got
dan
into
the
cab
and
off
to
the
station
carefully
making
him
an
active
partner
in
the
whole
undertaking
even
to
checking
his
own
bag
before
he
bought
his
own
ticket
he
appealed
once
more
to
dan
look
here
i
feel
like
a
fool
going
off
with
you
on
this
expedition
be
honest
for
once
now
mavering
and
tell
me
you
thought
better
of
it
and
do
want
me
to
go
yes
yes
i
do
oh
yes
you
got
to
go
i
i
do
want
you
i
you
make
me
see
things
in
just
the
right
light
do
you
know
that
idea
of
yours
about
little
steps
it
braced
me
all
up
yes
you
such
an
infernal
humbug
said
boardman
i
ca
tell
whether
you
want
me
or
not
but
i
in
for
it
now
and
i
then
he
bought
his
ticket
xlv
boardman
put
himself
in
charge
of
mavering
and
took
him
into
the
smoking
car
it
was
impossible
to
indulge
a
poetic
gloom
there
without
becoming
unpleasantly
conspicuous
in
the
smoking
and
euchre
and
profanity
some
of
the
men
were
silent
and
dull
but
no
one
was
apparently
very
unhappy
and
perhaps
if
dan
had
dealt
in
absolute
sincerity
with
himself
even
he
would
not
have
found
himself
wholly
so
he
did
not
feel
as
he
had
felt
when
alice
rejected
him
then
he
was
wounded
to
the
quick
through
his
vanity
and
now
in
spite
of
all
in
spite
of
the
involuntary
tender
swaying
of
his
heart
toward
her
through
the
mere
force
of
habit
in
spite
of
some
remote
compunctions
for
his
want
of
candour
with
her
he
was
supported
by
a
sense
of
her
injustice
her
hardness
related
with
this
was
an
obscure
sense
of
escape
of
liberation
which
however
he
might
silence
and
disown
it
was
still
there
he
could
not
help
being
aware
that
he
had
long
relinquished
tastes
customs
purposes
ideals
to
gain
a
peace
that
seemed
more
and
more
fleeting
and
uncertain
and
that
he
had
submitted
to
others
which
now
that
the
moment
of
giving
pleasure
by
his
submission
was
past
he
recognised
as
disagreeable
he
felt
a
sort
of
guilt
in
his
enlargement
he
knew
by
all
that
he
had
ever
heard
or
read
of
people
in
his
position
that
he
ought
to
be
altogether
miserable
and
yet
this
consciousness
of
relief
persisted
he
told
himself
that
a
very
tragical
thing
had
befallen
him
that
this
broken
engagement
was
the
ruin
of
his
life
and
the
end
of
his
youth
and
that
he
must
live
on
an
old
and
joyless
man
wise
with
the
knowledge
that
comes
to
decrepitude
and
despair
he
imagined
a
certain
look
for
himself
a
gait
a
name
that
would
express
this
but
all
the
same
he
was
aware
of
having
got
out
of
something
was
it
a
bondage
a
scrape
as
boardman
called
it
he
thought
he
must
be
a
very
light
shallow
and
frivolous
nature
not
to
be
utterly
broken
up
by
his
disaster
i
do
know
what
i
going
home
for
he
said
hoarsely
to
boardman
kind
of
a
rest
i
suppose
suggested
his
friend
yes
i
guess
that
it
said
dan
i
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
rather
fine
it
was
a
fatigue
of
the
soul
that
he
was
to
rest
from
he
remembered
the
apostrophic
close
of
a
novel
in
which
the
heroine
dies
after
much
emotional
suffering
quiet
quiet
heart
he
repeated
to
himself
yes
he
too
had
died
to
hope
to
love
to
happiness
as
they
drew
near
their
journey
end
he
said
i
do
know
how
going
to
break
it
to
oh
probably
break
itself
said
boardman
these
things
usually
yes
of
course
dan
assented
know
from
your
looks
that
something
up
or
you
might
let
me
go
ahead
a
little
and
prepare
dan
laughed
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
boardman
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
nothing
i
like
more
than
these
little
trips
brightens
you
up
to
sere
the
misery
of
others
makes
you
feel
that
you
on
peculiarly
good
terms
with
providence
have
enjoyed
myself
so
much
since
that
day
in
boardman
eyes
twinkled
yes
said
dan
with
a
deep
sigh
it
a
pity
it
had
ended
oh
i
do
know
you
wo
have
to
go
through
with
it
again
something
that
had
to
come
was
it
never
been
satisfied
if
you
had
tried
it
kind
of
aching
void
before
and
now
you
got
yes
i
got
enough
said
dan
if
that
when
they
got
out
of
the
train
at
ponkwasset
falls
and
the
conductor
and
the
brakeman
who
knew
dan
as
his
father
son
and
treated
him
with
the
distinction
due
a
representative
of
an
interest
valued
by
the
road
had
bidden
him
a
respectfully
intimate
and
he
began
to
climb
the
hill
to
his
father
house
he
recurred
to
the
difficulty
before
him
in
breaking
the
news
to
his
family
i
wish
i
could
have
it
over
in
a
flash
i
wish
i
thought
to
telegraph
it
to
would
have
done
said
boardman
it
would
have
given
time
to
formulate
questions
and
conjectures
and
now
the
astonishment
will
take
their
breath
away
till
you
can
get
your
second
wind
and
then
you
be
all
you
think
so
asked
dan
submissively
know
so
you
see
if
you
could
have
had
it
over
in
a
flash
it
would
have
knocked
you
flat
but
now
you
taken
all
the
little
steps
and
you
got
a
lot
more
to
take
and
you
all
braced
up
see
like
rock
now
dan
laughed
in
forlorn
perception
of
boardman
affectionate
irony
little
steps
are
the
thing
you
have
to
go
in
now
and
meet
your
family
and
pass
the
time
of
day
with
each
one
and
talk
about
the
weather
and
account
for
my
being
along
and
ask
how
they
all
are
and
by
the
time
you
had
dinner
and
got
settled
with
your
legs
out
in
front
of
the
fire
you
be
just
in
the
mood
for
it
enjoy
telling
them
all
about
do
boardman
pleaded
dan
boardy
i
believe
if
i
could
get
in
and
up
to
my
room
without
anybody
seeing
me
i
let
you
tell
them
there
do
seem
to
be
anybody
about
and
i
think
we
could
manage
it
would
work
said
boardman
got
to
do
it
well
then
wait
a
minute
said
dan
desperately
and
boardman
knew
that
he
was
to
stay
outside
while
dan
reconnoitred
the
interior
dan
opened
one
door
after
another
till
he
stood
within
the
hot
brilliantly
lighted
hall
eunice
mavering
was
coming
down
the
stairs
hooded
and
wrapped
for
a
walk
on
the
long
verandahs
before
supper
dan
she
cried
it
all
up
eunice
he
said
at
once
as
if
she
had
asked
him
about
it
my
engagement
oh
i
so
glad
she
descended
upon
him
with
outstretched
arms
but
stopped
herself
before
she
reached
him
it
a
hoax
what
do
you
mean
do
you
really
mean
it
dan
i
guess
i
mean
it
but
do
hold
on
where
minnie
eunice
turned
and
ran
back
upstairs
minnie
min
she
called
on
her
way
dan
engagement
i
do
believe
it
answered
minnie
voice
joyously
from
within
some
room
it
was
followed
by
her
presence
with
successive
inquiries
how
do
you
know
did
you
get
a
letter
when
did
it
happen
oh
is
it
too
good
minnie
was
also
dressed
for
the
verandah
promenade
which
they
always
took
when
the
snow
was
too
deep
she
caught
sight
of
her
brother
as
she
came
down
why
dan
here
dan
i
been
thinking
about
you
all
she
kissed
him
which
eunice
was
now
reminded
to
do
too
yes
it
true
minnie
said
dan
gravely
i
came
up
to
tell
you
it
do
seem
to
distress
you
dan
said
his
sister
reproachfully
you
know
i
did
mean
to
say
anything
i
only
felt
so
glad
to
have
you
back
i
understand
minnie
i
do
blame

sisterly
authority

no
let
him
go
eunice
pleaded
minnie
poor
dan
and
i
think
we
ought
to
go
to
walk
when
dan
eyes
dimmed
and
his
voice
weakened
a
little
at
her
sympathy
yes
go
i
tired
that
all
there
is
anything
to
tell
you
hardly
miss
pasmer
why
he
pale
cried
minnie
eunice
oh
it
just
the
heat
in
dan
really
felt
a
little
sick
and
faint
with
it
but
he
was
not
sorry
to
seem
affected
by
the
day
strain
upon
his
nerves
the
girls
began
to
take
off
their
wraps
do
i
go
with
you
boardman
out
boardman
what
nonsense
exclaimed
eunice
he
like
to
hear
your
opinion
of
it
dan
began
but
his
sister
pulled
the
doors
open
and
ran
out
to
see
if
he
really
meant
that
too
whether
boardman
had
heard
her
or
had
discreetly
withdrawn
out
of
earshot
at
the
first
sound
of
voices
she
could
not
tell
but
she
found
him
some
distance
away
from
the
on
the
piazza
dan
just
managed
to
tell
us
you
were
here
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
glad
to
see
you
do
come
come
along
as
a
sort
of
job
comforter
boardman
explained
as
he
followed
her
in
and
he
had
the
silly
look
that
the
man
who
feels
himself
superfluous
must
wear
then
you
know
about
it
said
eunice
while
minnie
mavering
and
he
were
shaking
hands
yes
boardman
knows
he
can
tell
you
about
it
said
dan
from
the
hall
chair
he
had
dropped
into
he
rose
and
made
his
way
to
the
stairs
with
the
effect
of
leaving
the
whole
thing
to
them
his
sisters
ran
after
him
and
got
him
upstairs
and
into
his
room
with
boardman
connivance
and
eunice
put
up
the
window
while
minnie
went
to
get
some
cologne
to
wet
his
forehead
their
efforts
were
so
successful
that
he
revived
sufficiently
to
drive
them
out
of
his
room
and
make
them
go
and
show
boardman
to
his
you
know
the
way
boardman
said
eunice
going
before
him
while
minnie
followed
timorously
but
curious
for
what
he
should
say
she
lingered
on
the
threshold
while
her
sister
went
in
and
pulled
the
electric
apparatus
which
lighted
the
i
suppose
dan
break
it
she
said
turning
sharply
upon
him
no
and
i
do
think
he
was
to
blame
said
boardman
inferring
her
reserved
anxiety
oh
i
quite
sure
of
that
said
eunice
rejecting
what
she
had
asked
for
you
find
everything
boardman
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
with
dan
supper
at
how
severe
you
were
with
him
murmured
minnie
following
her
away
severe
with
dan
no
with
what
nonsense
i
had
to
be
i
could
let
him
defend
dan
to
me
couple
of
silly
boys
after
a
moment
minnie
said
i
do
think
he
who
mr
well
dan
is
then
to
bring
him
at
such
a
time
but
i
suppose
he
felt
that
he
could
get
here
without
him
what
a
boy
think
of
such
a
child
being
engaged
i
hope
we
sha
hear
any
more
of
such
nonsense
for
one
while
again
at
least
till
dan
got
his
they
went
down
into
the
library
where
in
their
excitement
they
sat
down
with
most
of
their
outdoor
things
on
minnie
had
the
soft
of
gentle
natures
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
would
have
had
dan
bear
it
she
said
rebelliously
how
like
a
man
or
like
a
woman
how
do
you
suppose
miss
bearing
it
do
you
suppose
she
got
some
friend
to
help
her
if
she
broken
it
she
does
need
any
one
urged
minnie
well
said
eunice
with
her
high
scorn
of
dan
unabated
i
never
could
have
liked
that
girl
but
i
certainly
begin
to
respect
her
i
think
i
could
have
got
on
with
her
now
that
it
no
use
i
declare
she
broke
off
we
sitting
here
sweltering
to
death
what
are
we
keeping
our
things
on
for
she
began
to
tear
hers
violently
off
and
to
fling
them
on
chairs
scolding
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
with
minnie
at
their
a
heavy
step
sounded
on
the
verandah
without
there
father
she
cried
vividly
jumping
to
her
feet
and
running
to
the
door
while
minnie
in
a
nervous
bewilderment
ran
off
upstairs
to
her
room
eunice
flung
the
door
open
well
father
we
got
dan
back
and
at
a
look
of
quiet
question
in
his
eye
she
hurried
on
his
engagement
broken
and
he
come
up
here
to
tell
us
and
brought
boardman
along
to
where
is
he
asked
the
father
with
his
ruminant
quiet
pulling
off
first
one
sleeve
of
his
overcoat
and
pausing
for
eunice
answer
before
he
pulled
off
the
other
xlvi
he
up
in
his
room
resting
from
the
she
laughed
nervously
and
her
father
made
no
comment
he
took
off
his
articles
and
then
went
creaking
upstairs
to
dan
room
but
at
the
door
he
paused
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
and
turned
away
to
his
own
room
without
entering
dan
must
have
heard
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
to
him
well
dan
said
his
father
shaking
hands
i
suppose
eunice
has
told
you
well
i
want
to
tell
you
why
it
there
was
something
in
his
father
that
always
steadied
dan
and
kept
him
to
the
point
he
now
put
the
whole
case
fairly
and
squarely
and
his
candour
and
openness
seemed
to
him
to
react
and
characterise
his
conduct
throughout
he
did
not
realise
that
this
was
not
so
till
his
father
said
at
the
close
with
mild
justice
you
were
to
blame
for
letting
the
thing
run
on
so
at
loose
yes
of
course
said
dan
seeing
that
he
was
but
there
was
no
intention
of
deceiving
any
one
of
bad
faith
of
course
i
thought
it
could
be
easily
arranged
whenever
it
came
to
the
if
you
been
older
you
would
have
thought
that
you
had
women
to
deal
with
on
both
sides
but
if
it
all
over
i
not
sorry
i
always
admired
miss
pasmer
but
i
been
more
and
more
afraid
you
were
not
suited
to
each
other
your
mother
does
know
you
here
no
sir
i
suppose
not
do
you
think
it
will
distress
her
how
did
your
sisters
take
it
dan
gave
a
rueful
laugh
it
seemed
to
be
rather
a
popular
move
with
i
will
see
your
mother
first
said
the
father
he
left
them
when
they
went
into
the
library
after
supper
and
a
little
later
dan
and
eunice
left
boardman
in
charge
of
minnie
there
he
looked
after
their
unannounced
withdrawal
in
comic
consciousness
it
no
use
pretending
that
i
not
a
pretty
large
plurality
here
he
said
to
minnie
oh
i
so
glad
you
came
she
cried
with
a
kindness
which
was
as
real
as
if
it
had
been
more
sincere
do
you
think
mother
will
feel
it
much
asked
dan
anxiously
as
he
went
upstairs
with
eunice
well
she
hate
to
lose
a
correspondent
such
a
regular
one
said
eunice
and
the
affair
being
so
far
beyond
any
other
comment
she
laughed
the
rest
of
the
way
to
their
mother
room
the
whole
family
had
in
some
degree
that
foible
which
affects
people
who
lead
isolated
lives
they
come
to
think
that
they
are
the
only
people
who
have
their
virtues
they
exaggerate
these
and
they
conceive
a
kindness
even
for
the
qualities
which
are
not
their
virtues
mavering
life
was
secluded
again
from
the
family
seclusion
and
their
peculiarities
were
intensified
in
her
besides
she
had
some
very
marked
peculiarities
of
her
own
and
these
were
also
intensified
by
the
solitude
to
which
she
was
necessarily
left
so
much
she
meditated
a
great
deal
upon
the
character
of
her
children
and
she
liked
to
analyse
and
censure
it
both
in
her
own
mind
and
openly
in
their
presence
she
was
very
trenchant
and
definite
in
these
estimates
of
them
she
liked
to
ticket
them
and
then
ticket
them
anew
she
explored
their
ancestral
history
on
both
sides
for
the
origin
of
their
traits
and
there
were
times
when
she
reduced
them
in
formula
to
mere
congeries
of
inherited
characteristics
if
eunice
was
and
despotic
she
was
just
like
her
grandmother
mavering
if
minnie
was
all
sentiment
and
gentle
stubbornness
it
was
because
two
aunts
of
hers
one
on
either
side
were
exactly
so
if
dan
loved
pleasure
and
beauty
and
was
sinuous
and
uncertain
in
so
many
ways
and
yet
was
so
kind
and
faithful
and
good
as
well
as
and
undecided
it
was
because
her
mother
and
her
mother
father
had
these
qualities
in
the
same
combination
when
she
took
her
children
to
pieces
before
their
faces
she
was
sharp
and
admonitory
enough
with
them
she
warned
them
to
what
their
characters
would
bring
them
to
if
they
did
not
look
out
but
perhaps
because
she
beheld
them
so
hopelessly
the
present
effect
of
the
accumulated
tendencies
of
the
family
past
she
was
tender
and
forgiving
to
their
actions
the
mother
came
in
there
and
superseded
the
student
of
heredity
she
found
excuse
for
them
in
the
perversity
of
circumstance
in
the
peculiar
hardship
of
the
case
in
the
malignant
misbehaviour
of
others
as
dan
entered
with
the
precedence
his
father
and
sister
yielded
him
as
the
principal
actor
in
the
scene
which
must
follow
she
lifted
herself
vigorously
in
bed
and
propped
herself
on
the
elbow
of
one
arm
while
she
stretched
the
other
towards
him
i
glad
of
it
dan
she
called
at
the
moment
he
opened
the
door
and
as
he
came
toward
her
she
continued
with
the
amazing
velocity
of
utterance
peculiar
to
nervous
sufferers
of
her
sex
i
know
all
about
it
and
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
and
i
do
blame
her
poor
helpless
young
things
but
it
a
perfect
mercy
it
all
over
it
the
greatest
deliverance
i
ever
heard
of
you
have
been
eaten
up
alive
i
saw
it
and
i
knew
it
from
the
very
first
moment
and
i
lived
in
fear
and
trembling
for
you
you
could
have
got
on
well
enough
if
you
been
left
to
yourselves
but
that
you
could
have
been
nor
hope
to
be
as
long
as
you
breathed
from
the
meddling
and
the
machinations
and
the
malice
of
that
unscrupulous
and
unconscionable
old
cat
by
the
time
mavering
had
hissed
out
the
last
word
she
had
her
arm
round
her
boy
neck
and
was
clutching
him
safe
and
sound
after
his
peril
to
her
breast
and
between
her
kissing
and
crying
she
repeated
her
accusals
and
denunciations
with
violent
volubility
dan
could
not
have
replied
to
them
in
that
effusion
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
he
felt
for
his
mother
partisanship
and
when
she
went
on
in
almost
the
very
terms
of
his
and
told
him
that
he
had
done
as
he
had
because
it
was
easy
for
him
to
yield
and
he
could
not
imagine
a
cat
who
would
put
her
daughter
up
to
entrapping
him
into
a
promise
that
she
knew
must
break
his
mother
heart
he
found
her
so
right
on
the
main
point
that
he
could
not
help
some
question
of
pasmer
in
his
soul
could
she
really
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
she
was
very
sly
and
she
might
be
very
false
and
it
was
certainly
she
who
had
first
proposed
their
going
abroad
together
it
looked
as
if
it
might
be
as
his
mother
said
and
at
any
rate
it
was
no
time
to
dispute
her
and
he
did
not
say
a
word
in
behalf
of
pasmer
whom
she
continued
to
rend
in
a
thousand
pieces
and
scatter
to
the
winds
till
she
had
to
stop
breathless
yes
it
quite
as
i
expected
she
did
everything
she
could
to
trap
you
into
it
she
fairly
flung
that
poor
girl
at
you
she
laid
her
plans
so
that
you
could
say
no
she
understood
your
character
from
the
start
and
then
when
it
came
out
by
accident
and
she
saw
that
she
had
older
heads
to
deal
with
and
you
were
not
going
to
be
quite
at
her
mercy
she
dropped
the
mask
in
an
instant
and
made
alice
break
with
you
oh
i
could
see
through
her
from
the
beginning
and
the
next
time
dan
i
advise
you
as
you
never
suspect
anybody
yourself
to
consult
with
somebody
who
does
take
people
for
what
they
seem
and
not
to
let
yourself
be
flattered
out
of
your
sensor
even
if
you
see
your
father
mavering
dropped
back
on
her
pillow
and
her
husband
smiled
patiently
at
their
daughter
dan
saw
his
patient
smile
and
understood
it
and
the
injustice
which
his
father
bore
made
him
finally
unwilling
to
let
another
remain
under
it
hard
as
it
was
to
oppose
his
mother
in
anything
when
she
was
praising
him
so
sweetly
and
comforting
him
in
the
moment
of
his
need
he
pulled
himself
together
to
protest
no
no
mother
i
do
think
pasmer
was
to
blame
i
do
believe
she
had
anything
to
do
with
it
always
stood
my
friend
oh
i
no
doubt
she
made
you
think
so
dan
said
his
mother
with
unabated
fondness
for
him
and
you
think
so
because
you
so
simple
and
good
and
never
suspect
evil
of
any
one
it
this
hideous
optimism
that
killing
everything
a
certain
note
in
the
invalid
falling
voice
seemed
to
warn
her
hearers
of
an
impending
change
that
could
do
no
one
good
eunice
rose
hastily
and
interrupted
mother
boardman
here
he
came
up
with
dan
may
minnie
come
in
with
him
mavering
shot
a
glance
of
inquiry
at
dan
and
then
let
a
swift
inspection
range
over
all
the
details
of
the
room
and
finally
concentrate
itself
on
the
silk
and
lace
of
her
bed
over
which
she
passed
a
smoothing
hand
mr
boardman
she
cried
with
instantly
recovered
amiability
of
course
she
may
xlvii
in
boston
the
rumour
of
dan
broken
engagement
was
followed
promptly
by
a
denial
of
it
both
the
rumour
and
the
denial
were
apparently
authoritative
but
it
gives
the
effect
of
a
little
greater
sagacity
to
distrust
rumours
of
all
kinds
and
most
people
went
to
bed
after
the
teas
and
dinners
and
receptions
and
clubs
at
which
the
fact
was
first
debated
in
the
that
it
was
not
so
the
next
day
they
found
the
rumour
still
persistent
the
denial
was
still
in
the
air
too
but
it
seemed
weaker
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
it
had
become
a
question
as
to
which
broke
the
engagement
and
why
by
the
end
of
a
week
it
was
known
that
alice
had
broken
the
engagement
but
the
reason
could
not
be
ascertained
this
was
not
for
want
of
asking
more
or
less
direct
pasmer
of
course
went
and
came
at
his
club
with
perfect
immunity
men
are
quite
as
curious
as
women
but
they
set
business
bounds
to
their
curiosity
and
do
not
dream
of
passing
these
with
women
who
have
no
business
of
their
own
and
can
not
quell
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
this
thing
or
that
is
not
their
affair
there
is
no
question
so
intimate
that
they
will
not
put
it
to
some
other
woman
perhaps
it
is
not
so
intimate
or
perhaps
it
will
not
seem
so
at
any
rate
they
chance
it
pasmer
was
given
every
opportunity
to
explain
the
facts
to
the
ladies
whom
she
met
and
if
she
was
much
afflicted
by
alice
behaviour
she
had
a
measure
of
consolation
in
using
her
skill
to
baffle
the
research
of
her
acquaintance
after
each
encounter
of
the
kind
she
had
the
pleasure
of
reflecting
that
absolutely
nothing
more
than
she
meant
had
become
known
the
case
never
became
fully
known
through
her
it
was
the
girl
herself
who
told
it
to
miss
cotton
in
one
of
those
moments
of
confidence
which
are
necessary
to
burdened
minds
and
it
is
doubtful
if
more
than
two
or
three
people
ever
clearly
understood
it
most
preferred
one
or
other
of
several
mistaken
versions
which
society
finally
settled
down
to
the
paroxysm
of
almost
in
which
alice
came
to
miss
cotton
moved
the
latter
to
the
deepest
sympathy
and
left
her
with
misgivings
which
became
an
intolerable
anguish
to
her
conscience
the
child
was
so
afflicted
at
what
she
had
done
not
because
she
wished
to
be
reconciled
with
her
lover
but
because
she
was
afraid
she
had
been
unjust
been
cruelly
impatient
and
peremptory
with
him
she
seemed
to
miss
cotton
so
absolutely
alone
and
friendless
with
her
great
trouble
she
was
so
helpless
so
hopeless
she
was
so
anxious
to
do
right
and
so
fearful
she
had
done
wrong
that
miss
cotton
would
not
have
been
miss
cotton
if
she
had
not
taken
her
in
her
arms
and
assured
her
that
in
everything
she
had
done
she
had
been
sublimely
and
nobly
right
a
lesson
to
all
her
sex
in
such
matters
for
ever
she
told
her
that
she
had
always
admired
her
but
that
now
she
idolised
her
that
she
felt
like
going
down
on
her
knees
and
simply
worshipping
her
oh
do
say
that
miss
cotton
pleaded
alice
pulling
away
from
her
embrace
but
still
clinging
to
her
with
her
tremulous
cold
little
hands
i
ca
bear
it
i
wicked
and
hard
you
do
know
how
bad
i
am
and
i
afraid
of
being
weak
of
doing
more
harm
yet
oh
i
wronged
him
cruelly
in
ever
letting
him
get
engaged
to
me
but
now
what
said
will
support
me
if
you
think
i
done
right
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
that
i
should
come
to
you
with
my
trouble
instead
of
my
mother
but
i
been
to
her
and
and
we
think
alike
on
so
few
subjects
you
know
yes
yes
i
know
dear
said
miss
cotton
in
the
tender
folly
of
her
heart
with
the
satisfaction
which
every
woman
feels
in
being
more
sufficient
to
another
in
trouble
than
her
natural
comforters
and
i
wanted
to
know
how
you
saw
it
and
now
if
you
feel
as
you
say
i
can
never
doubt
myself
she
tempested
out
of
miss
cotton
house
all
tearful
under
the
veil
she
had
pulled
down
and
as
she
shut
the
door
of
her
coupe
miss
heart
jumped
into
her
throat
with
an
impulse
to
run
after
her
to
recall
her
to
recant
to
modify
everything
from
that
moment
miss
cotton
trouble
began
and
it
became
a
torment
that
mounted
and
gave
her
no
peace
till
she
imparted
it
she
said
to
herself
that
she
should
suffer
to
the
utmost
in
this
matter
and
if
she
spoke
to
any
one
it
must
not
be
to
same
one
who
had
agreed
with
her
about
alice
but
to
some
hard
skeptical
nature
some
one
who
would
look
at
it
from
a
totally
different
point
of
view
and
would
punish
her
for
her
error
if
she
had
committed
an
error
in
supporting
and
consoling
alice
all
the
time
she
was
thinking
of
brinkley
brinkley
had
come
into
her
mind
at
once
but
it
was
only
after
repeated
struggles
that
she
could
get
the
strength
to
go
to
her
brinkley
sacredly
pledged
to
secrecy
listened
with
a
sufficiently
dismaying
air
to
the
story
which
miss
cotton
told
her
in
the
extremity
of
her
fear
and
doubt
well
she
said
at
the
end
have
you
written
to
mavering
written
to
mavering
gasped
miss
cotton
yes
to
tell
him
she
wants
him
wants
him
back
miss
cotton
echoed
again
that
what
she
came
to
you
oh
brinkley
moaned
miss
cotton
and
she
stared
at
her
in
mute
reproach
brinkley
laughed
i
do
say
she
knew
that
she
came
for
that
but
there
no
doubt
that
she
did
and
she
went
away
bitterly
disappointed
with
your
consolation
and
support
she
did
want
anything
of
the
kind
you
may
comfort
yourself
with
that
reflection
miss
mrs
brinkley
said
miss
cotton
with
a
severity
which
ought
to
have
been
extremely
effective
from
so
mild
a
person
do
you
mean
to
accuse
that
poor
child
of
dissimulation
of
deceit
in
such
a
a
no
shouted
brinkley
she
did
know
what
she
was
doing
any
more
than
you
did
and
she
went
home
perfectly
and
i
hope
she
stay
so
for
the
good
of
all
parties
miss
cotton
was
so
bewildered
by
brinkley
interpretation
of
alice
latent
motives
that
she
let
the
truculent
hostility
of
her
aspiration
pass
unheeded
she
looked
helplessly
about
and
seemed
faint
so
that
brinkley
without
appearing
to
notice
her
state
interposed
the
question
of
a
little
sherry
when
it
had
been
brought
and
miss
cotton
had
sipped
the
glass
that
trembled
in
one
hand
while
her
emotion
shattered
a
biscuit
with
the
other
brinkley
went
on
i
glad
the
engagement
is
broken
and
i
hope
it
will
never
be
mended
if
what
you
tell
me
of
her
reason
for
breaking
it
is
true
oh
i
feel
so
guilty
for
telling
you
i
no
right
to
please
never
speak
of
it
pleaded
miss
cotton
then
i
feel
more
than
ever
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
that
to
help
it
on
again
would
be
a
miss
cotton
gave
a
small
jump
at
the
word
as
if
she
had
already
committed
the
crime
she
had
longed
to
do
it
yes
i
mean
to
say
that
they
are
better
parted
than
plighted
if
matches
are
made
in
heaven
i
believe
some
of
them
are
unmade
there
too
they
not
adapted
to
each
other
there
too
great
a
you
mean
began
miss
cotton
from
her
prepossession
of
superiority
that
she
altogether
his
inferior
intellectually
and
oh
i
ca
admit
that
cried
miss
cotton
glad
to
have
brinkley
go
too
far
and
plucking
up
courage
from
her
excess
intellectually
and
morally
repeated
brinkley
with
the
mounting
conviction
which
ladies
seem
to
get
from
mere
persistence
i
saw
that
girl
at
campobello
i
watched
i
never
felt
that
you
did
her
justice
cried
miss
cotton
with
the
valour
of
a
there
was
an
there
certainly
was
a
sympathy
i
happy
to
say
retorted
brinkley
i
know
her
and
i
know
her
family
root
and
branch
the
pasmers
are
the
dullest
and
most
selfish
people
in
the
oh
i
do
think
that
her
character
said
miss
cotton
ruffling
her
feathers
defensively
neither
do
i
she
has
no
fixed
character
no
girl
has
nobody
has
we
all
have
twenty
different
characters
more
characters
than
gowns
and
we
put
them
on
and
take
them
off
just
as
often
for
different
occasions
i
know
you
think
each
person
is
permanently
this
or
that
but
my
experience
is
that
half
the
time
they
the
other
then
why
said
miss
cotton
winking
hard
as
some
weak
people
do
when
they
thick
they
are
making
a
point
do
you
say
that
alice
is
dull
and
selfish
i
do
not
always
or
not
simply
so
that
the
character
of
the
pasmer
blood
but
it
crossed
with
twenty
different
currents
in
her
and
from
some
body
that
the
pasmer
dulness
and
selfishness
must
have
driven
mad
she
got
a
crazy
streak
of
piety
and
that
got
mixed
up
in
her
again
with
a
nonsensical
ideal
of
duty
and
everything
she
does
she
not
only
thinks
is
right
but
she
thinks
it
religious
and
she
thinks
it
if
you
seen
her
if
you
heard
her
this
morning
said
miss
cotton
you
would
say
that
brinkley
refused
this
with
an
impatient
gesture
it
is
what
she
is
now
or
seems
to
be
or
thinks
she
is
it
what
she
going
to
finally
harden
into
what
going
to
be
her
prevailing
character
now
dan
mavering
has
just
the
faults
that
will
make
such
a
girl
think
her
own
defects
are
virtues
because
they
so
different
i
tell
you
alice
pasmer
has
neither
the
head
nor
the
heart
to
appreciate
the
goodness
the
loveliness
of
a
fellow
like
dan
i
think
she
feels
his
sweetness
fully
urged
miss
cotton
but
she
could
endure
his
uncertainty
with
her
the
truth
is
first
of
all
then
she
a
little
goose
if
she
had
the
sense
to
know
it
she
would
know
that
he
might
delay
and
temporise
and
beat
about
the
bush
but
he
would
be
true
when
it
was
necessary
i
have
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
but
that
poor
fellow
was
going
on
in
perfect
security
because
he
felt
that
it
would
be
so
easy
for
him
to
give
up
and
supposed
it
would
be
just
as
easy
for
her
i
do
suppose
he
had
a
misgiving
and
it
must
have
come
upon
him
like
a
do
you
think
timidly
suggested
miss
cotton
that
truth
is
the
first
essential
in
marriage
of
course
it
is
and
if
this
girl
was
worthy
of
dan
mavering
if
she
were
capable
of
loving
him
or
anybody
else
unselfishly
she
would
have
felt
his
truth
even
if
she
could
have
seen
it
i
believe
this
minute
that
that
manoeuvring
humbugging
mother
of
hers
is
a
better
woman
a
kinder
woman
than
she
alice
says
her
mother
took
his
part
said
miss
cotton
with
a
sigh
she
took
your
view
of
she
a
sensible
woman
but
i
hope
she
wo
be
able
to
get
him
into
her
toils
again
continued
brinkley
recurring
to
the
conventional
estimate
of
pasmer
i
ca
help
feeling
believing
that
they
come
together
somehow
still
murmured
miss
cotton
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
all
along
wished
this
and
she
tried
to
remember
if
what
she
had
said
to
comfort
alice
might
be
construed
as
adverse
to
a
reconciliation
i
hope
they
wo
then
said
brinkley
for
they
could
help
being
unhappy
together
with
their
temperaments
there
one
thing
miss
cotton
that
more
essential
in
marriage
than
miss
instantaneous
honesty
and
that
patience
with
wrong
demanded
miss
cotton
yes
even
with
wrong
but
i
meant
patience
with
each
other
marriage
is
a
perpetual
pardon
concession
surrender
it
an
everlasting
giving
up
that
the
divine
thing
about
it
and
that
just
what
miss
passer
could
never
conceive
of
because
she
is
and
conceited
and
unyielding
she
would
make
him
miss
cotton
rose
in
a
bewilderment
which
did
not
permit
her
to
go
at
once
there
was
something
in
her
mind
which
she
wished
to
urge
but
she
could
not
make
it
out
though
she
fingered
in
vague
generalities
when
she
got
a
block
away
from
the
house
it
suddenly
came
to
her
love
if
they
loved
each
other
would
not
all
be
well
with
them
she
would
have
liked
to
run
back
and
put
that
question
to
brinkley
but
just
then
she
met
brinkley
lumbering
heavily
homeward
she
heard
his
hard
breathing
from
the
exertion
of
bowing
to
her
as
he
passed
his
wife
met
him
in
the
hall
and
went
up
to
kiss
him
he
smelt
abominably
of
tobacco
smoke
hullo
said
her
husband
what
are
you
after
nothing
said
his
wife
enjoying
his
joke
come
in
here
i
want
to
tell
you
how
i
have
just
sat
upon
miss
xlviii
the
relations
between
dan
and
his
father
had
always
been
kindly
and
trustful
they
now
became
in
a
degree
that
touched
and
flattered
the
young
fellow
confidential
with
the
rest
of
the
family
there
soon
ceased
to
be
any
reference
to
his
engagement
his
sisters
were
glad
each
in
her
way
to
have
him
back
again
and
whatever
they
may
have
said
between
themselves
they
said
nothing
to
him
about
alice
his
mother
appeared
to
have
finished
with
the
matter
the
first
night
she
had
her
theory
and
she
did
it
justice
and
when
mavering
had
once
done
a
thing
justice
she
did
not
bring
it
up
again
unless
somebody
disputed
it
but
nobody
had
defended
pasmer
after
dan
feeble
protest
in
her
behalf
mavering
theory
was
accepted
with
obedience
if
not
conviction
the
whole
affair
dropped
except
between
dan
and
his
father
dan
was
certainly
not
so
gay
as
he
used
to
be
he
was
glad
to
find
that
he
was
not
so
gay
there
had
been
a
sort
of
mercy
in
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
it
benumbed
him
and
the
real
stress
and
pain
came
during
the
long
weeks
that
followed
when
nothing
occurred
to
vary
the
situation
in
any
manner
he
did
not
hear
a
word
about
alice
from
boston
nor
any
rumour
of
her
people
at
first
he
had
intended
to
go
back
with
boardman
and
face
it
out
but
there
seemed
no
use
in
this
and
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
found
it
impossible
boardman
went
back
alone
and
he
put
dan
things
together
in
his
rooms
at
boston
and
sent
them
to
him
so
that
dan
remained
at
home
he
set
about
helping
his
father
at
the
business
with
unaffected
docility
he
tried
not
to
pose
and
he
did
his
best
to
bear
his
loss
and
humiliation
with
manly
fortitude
but
his
whole
life
had
not
set
so
strongly
in
one
direction
that
it
could
be
sharply
turned
aside
now
and
not
in
moments
of
forgetfulness
press
against
the
barriers
almost
to
bursting
now
and
then
when
he
came
to
himself
from
the
wonted
tendency
and
remembered
that
alice
and
he
who
had
been
all
in
all
to
each
other
were
now
nothing
the
pain
was
so
sharp
so
astonishing
that
he
could
not
keep
down
a
groan
which
he
then
tried
to
turn
off
with
a
cough
or
a
snatch
of
song
or
a
whistle
looking
wildly
round
to
see
if
any
one
had
noticed
once
this
happened
when
his
father
and
he
were
walking
silently
home
from
the
works
and
his
father
said
without
touching
him
or
showing
his
sympathy
except
in
his
tone
of
humorously
frank
recognition
does
it
still
hurt
a
little
occasionally
dan
yes
sir
it
hurts
said
the
son
and
he
turned
his
face
aside
and
whistled
through
his
teeth
well
it
a
trial
i
suppose
said
his
father
with
his
gentle
soft
but
there
are
greater
how
greater
asked
dan
with
sad
incredulity
i
lost
all
that
made
life
worth
living
and
it
all
my
own
fault
yes
said
his
father
i
think
she
was
a
good
good
cried
dan
the
word
seemed
to
choke
him
still
i
doubt
if
it
all
your
dan
looked
round
at
him
he
added
and
i
think
it
perhaps
for
the
best
as
it
dan
halted
and
then
said
oh
i
suppose
so
with
dreary
resignation
as
they
walked
on
let
us
go
round
by
the
paddock
said
his
father
and
see
if
put
the
horses
up
yet
you
can
hardly
remember
your
mother
before
she
became
an
invalid
i
suppose
he
added
as
dan
mechanically
turned
aside
with
him
from
the
path
that
led
to
the
house
into
that
leading
to
the
barn
no
i
was
such
a
little
fellow
said
dan
women
give
up
a
great
deal
when
they
marry
said
the
elder
it
not
strange
that
they
exaggerate
the
sacrifice
and
expect
more
in
return
than
it
in
the
nature
of
men
to
give
them
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
have
you
marry
a
woman
of
an
exacting
i
afraid
she
was
exacting
said
dan
but
she
never
asked
more
than
was
and
it
difficult
to
do
all
that
right
suggested
the
elder
i
sure
you
always
have
father
said
the
son
the
father
did
not
respond
i
wish
you
could
remember
your
mother
when
she
was
well
he
said
presently
he
added
i
think
it
is
best
for
a
woman
to
be
too
much
in
love
with
her
dan
took
this
to
himself
and
he
laughed
harshly
she
been
able
to
dissemble
her
love
at
his
father
went
on
women
keep
the
romantic
feeling
longer
than
men
it
dies
out
of
us
very
soon
perhaps
too
you
think
i
could
have
come
to
time
asked
dan
well
as
turned
out
i
wo
have
no
man
can
be
all
a
woman
wishes
him
to
be
said
his
father
better
for
the
disappointment
to
come
before
it
too
i
was
to
blame
said
dan
stoutly
she
was
all
you
were
to
blame
in
the
particular
instance
his
father
answered
but
in
general
the
fault
was
in
her
or
her
temperament
as
long
as
the
romance
lasted
she
might
have
deluded
herself
and
believed
you
were
all
she
imagined
you
but
romance
ca
last
even
with
women
i
don
like
your
faults
and
i
do
want
you
to
excuse
them
to
yourself
i
like
your
chancing
things
and
leaving
them
to
come
out
all
right
of
themselves
but
i
always
tried
to
make
you
children
see
all
your
qualities
in
their
true
proportion
and
yes
i
know
that
sir
said
dan
perhaps
continued
his
father
as
they
swung
easily
along
shoulder
to
shoulder
i
may
have
gone
too
far
in
that
direction
because
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
take
your
mother
too
seriously
in
the
other
that
you
might
not
understand
that
she
judged
you
from
her
nerves
and
not
her
convictions
it
part
of
her
malady
of
her
suffering
that
her
inherited
puritanism
clouds
her
judgment
and
makes
her
see
all
faults
as
of
one
size
and
equally
damning
i
wish
you
to
know
that
she
was
not
always
so
but
was
once
able
to
distinguish
differences
in
error
and
to
realise
that
evil
is
of
yes
i
know
that
said
dan
she
is
now
when
she
feels
harm
comes
from
many
things
but
evil
is
of
the
heart
i
have
you
condemn
yourself
too
severely
for
harm
that
you
intend
that
remorse
that
insanity
and
i
would
have
you
fall
under
the
condemnation
of
another
invalid
thank
you
father
said
dan
they
had
come
up
to
the
paddock
behind
the
barn
and
they
laid
their
arms
on
the
fence
while
they
looked
over
at
the
horses
which
were
still
there
the
beasts
in
their
rough
winter
coats
some
bedaubed
with
frozen
clots
of
the
mud
in
which
they
had
been
rolling
earlier
in
the
afternoon
stood
motionless
in
the
thin
keen
breeze
that
crept
over
the
hillside
from
the
march
sunset
and
blew
their
manes
and
tails
out
toward
dan
and
his
father
dan
pony
sent
him
a
gleam
of
recognition
from
under
his
frowsy
bangs
but
did
not
stir
bunch
looks
like
a
caterpillar
he
said
recalling
the
time
when
his
father
had
given
him
the
pony
he
was
a
boy
then
and
the
pony
was
as
much
to
him
it
went
through
his
mind
as
alice
had
ever
been
was
it
all
a
jest
an
irony
he
asked
himself
he
getting
pretty
old
said
his
father
let
see
you
were
only
ten
said
dan
we
had
him
thirteen
some
of
the
horses
pricked
up
their
ears
at
the
sound
of
their
voices
one
of
them
bit
another
neck
the
victim
threw
up
his
heels
and
squealed
pat
called
from
the
stable
heigh
you
divils
i
think
he
better
take
them
in
said
dan
father
and
he
continued
as
if
it
were
all
the
same
subject
i
hope
you
have
seen
something
more
of
the
world
before
you
fall
in
love
the
next
thank
you
there
wo
be
any
next
time
but
do
you
consider
the
world
such
a
school
of
morals
then
i
supposed
it
was
a
very
bad
we
seem
to
have
been
all
born
into
it
said
the
father
he
lifted
his
arms
from
the
fence
and
dan
mechanically
followed
him
into
the
stable
a
warm
homely
smell
of
hay
and
of
horses
filled
the
place
a
lantern
glimmered
a
faint
blot
in
the
loft
where
pat
was
pitching
some
hay
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
boards
the
naphtha
gas
weakly
flared
from
the
jets
beside
the
whence
a
smell
of
leather
issued
and
mingled
with
the
other
smell
the
simple
earthy
wholesomeness
of
the
place
appealed
to
dan
and
comforted
him
the
hay
began
to
tumble
from
the
loft
with
a
pleasant
rustling
sound
his
father
called
up
to
pat
i
think
you
better
take
the
horses
in
yes
sir
i
got
the
ready
for
dan
remembered
how
he
and
eunice
used
to
get
into
the
with
his
pony
and
play
at
circus
with
it
he
stood
up
on
the
pony
and
his
sister
was
the
the
picture
of
his
careless
childhood
reflected
a
deeper
pathos
upon
his
troubled
present
and
he
sighed
again
his
father
said
as
they
moved
on
through
the
barn
some
of
the
best
people
i
ever
known
were
what
were
called
worldly
people
they
are
apt
to
be
sincere
and
they
have
none
of
the
spiritual
pride
the
conceit
of
which
often
comes
to
people
who
are
shut
up
by
conscience
or
circumstance
to
the
study
of
their
own
motives
and
i
do
think
she
was
one
of
that
kind
said
dan
oh
i
do
know
that
she
was
but
the
chances
of
happiness
of
goodness
would
be
greater
with
a
less
person
for
ah
yes
for
me
said
dan
bitterly
because
i
had
it
in
me
to
be
frank
with
her
with
a
man
like
me
a
woman
had
better
be
a
little
scampish
too
father
i
could
get
over
the
loss
she
might
have
died
and
i
could
have
got
over
that
but
i
ca
get
over
being
to
i
do
think
i
indulge
in
any
remorse
said
his
father
nothing
so
useless
so
depraving
as
that
if
you
see
you
wrong
for
your
warning
not
for
your
dan
was
not
really
feeling
very
remorseful
he
had
never
felt
that
he
was
much
to
blame
but
he
had
an
intellectual
perception
of
the
case
and
he
thought
that
he
ought
to
feel
remorseful
it
was
this
persuasion
that
he
took
for
an
emotion
he
continued
to
look
very
disconsolate
come
said
his
father
touching
his
arm
i
do
want
you
to
brood
upon
these
things
it
can
do
no
manner
of
good
i
want
you
to
go
to
new
york
next
week
and
look
after
that
lafflin
process
if
it
what
he
thinks
if
he
can
really
cast
his
brass
patterns
without
it
will
revolutionise
our
business
i
want
to
get
hold
of
the
portuguese
cook
was
standing
in
the
basement
door
which
they
passed
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
saluted
father
and
son
with
a
glittering
smile
hello
joe
said
dan
ah
joe
said
his
father
he
touched
his
hat
to
the
cook
who
snatched
his
cap
off
what
a
brick
you
are
father
thought
dan
his
heart
leaped
at
the
notion
of
getting
away
from
ponkwasset
he
perceived
how
it
had
been
irking
him
to
stay
if
you
think
i
could
manage
it
with
lafflin
oh
i
think
you
could
he
another
slippery
dan
laughed
for
pleasure
and
pain
at
his
father
joke
xlix
in
new
york
dan
found
that
lafflin
had
gone
to
washington
to
look
up
something
in
connection
with
his
patent
in
his
eagerness
to
get
away
from
home
dan
had
supposed
that
his
father
meant
to
make
a
holiday
for
him
and
he
learned
with
a
little
surprise
that
he
was
quite
in
earnest
about
getting
hold
of
the
invention
he
wrote
home
of
lafflin
absence
and
he
got
a
telegram
in
reply
ordering
him
to
follow
on
to
washington
the
sun
was
shining
warm
on
the
asphalt
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
pennsylvania
depot
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
and
put
it
into
the
hansom
that
drove
up
for
him
the
sky
overhead
was
of
an
intense
blue
that
made
him
remember
the
boston
sky
as
pale
and
grey
when
the
hansom
tilted
out
into
the
avenue
he
had
a
joyous
glimpse
of
the
white
house
of
the
capitol
swimming
like
a
balloon
in
the
cloudless
air
a
keen
march
breeze
swept
the
dust
before
him
and
through
its
veil
the
classic
treasury
building
showed
like
one
edifice
standing
perfect
amid
ruin
represented
by
the
irregularities
of
the
business
architecture
along
the
wide
street
he
had
never
been
in
washington
before
and
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
having
got
back
to
rome
which
he
remembered
from
his
boyish
visit
throughout
his
stay
he
seemed
to
be
coming
up
against
the
facade
of
the
temple
of
neptune
but
it
was
the
patent
office
or
the
treasury
building
or
the
white
house
and
under
the
gay
southern
sky
this
reversion
to
the
sensations
of
a
happier
time
began
at
once
and
made
itself
a
lasting
relief
he
felt
a
lift
in
his
spirits
from
the
first
they
gave
him
a
room
at
wormley
where
the
chairs
comported
themselves
as
upon
two
or
three
legs
as
they
would
have
done
at
boston
upon
four
the
cooking
was
excellent
and
a
mercenary
welcome
glittered
from
all
the
kind
black
faces
around
him
after
the
quiet
of
ponkwasset
and
the
rush
of
new
york
the
lazy
ease
of
the
hotel
pleased
him
the
clack
of
boots
over
its
pavements
the
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
the
southern
and
western
accents
the
spectacle
of
people
unexpectedly
encountering
and
recognising
each
other
in
the
office
and
the
all
helped
to
restore
him
to
a
hopefuller
mood
without
asking
his
heart
too
curiously
why
he
found
it
lighter
he
felt
that
he
was
still
young
in
the
weather
he
had
struck
a
cold
wave
and
the
wind
was
bitter
in
the
streets
but
they
were
full
of
sun
he
found
the
grass
green
in
sheltered
places
and
in
one
of
the
circles
he
plucked
a
blossomed
spray
from
an
adventurous
forceythia
this
happened
when
he
was
walking
from
wormley
to
the
arlington
by
a
roundabout
way
of
his
own
involuntary
invention
and
he
had
the
flowers
in
his
when
lafflin
was
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
reading
room
there
and
he
introduced
himself
lafflin
had
put
his
hat
far
back
on
his
head
and
was
intensely
chewing
a
toothpick
with
an
air
of
rapture
from
everything
about
him
he
seemed
a
very
simple
soul
to
dan
inexperience
of
men
and
the
young
fellow
had
no
difficulty
in
committing
him
to
a
fair
conditional
arrangement
he
was
going
to
stay
some
days
in
washington
and
he
promised
other
interviews
so
that
dan
thought
it
best
to
stay
too
he
used
a
sheet
of
the
arlington
in
writing
his
father
of
what
he
had
done
and
then
as
lafflin
had
left
him
he
posted
his
letter
at
the
desk
and
wandered
out
through
a
corridor
different
from
that
which
he
had
come
in
by
it
led
by
the
door
of
the
ladies
parlour
and
at
the
sound
of
women
voices
dan
halted
for
no
other
reason
than
that
such
voices
always
irresistibly
allured
him
he
went
in
putting
on
an
air
of
having
come
to
look
for
some
one
there
were
two
or
three
groups
of
ladies
receiving
friends
in
different
parts
of
the
room
at
the
window
a
girl
figure
silhouetted
itself
against
the
keen
light
and
as
he
advanced
into
the
room
peering
about
it
turned
with
a
certain
vividness
that
seemed
familiar
this
young
lady
whoever
she
was
had
the
advantage
of
dan
in
seeing
him
with
the
light
on
his
face
and
he
was
still
in
the
dark
about
her
when
she
advanced
swiftly
upon
him
holding
out
her
hand
you
do
seem
to
know
your
old
friends
mavering
and
the
manly
tones
left
him
no
doubt
he
felt
a
rush
of
gladness
and
he
clasped
her
hand
and
clung
to
it
as
if
he
were
not
going
to
let
it
go
again
bubbling
out
incoherencies
of
pleasure
at
meeting
her
why
miss
anderson
you
here
what
a
piece
of
luck
of
course
i
could
see
you
against
the
window
make
you
out
but
something
looked
familiar
and
the
way
you
turned
and
when
you
started
toward
me
i
awfully
glad
when
where
are
you
that
is
miss
anderson
kept
laughing
with
him
and
bubbled
back
that
she
was
very
glad
too
and
she
was
staying
with
her
aunt
in
that
hotel
and
they
had
been
there
a
month
and
did
he
think
washington
was
charming
but
it
was
too
bad
he
had
just
got
there
with
that
blizzard
the
weather
had
been
perfectly
divine
till
the
day
before
yesterday
he
took
the
spray
of
forceythia
out
of
his
buttonhole
i
can
believe
it
i
found
this
in
one
of
the
squares
and
i
think
it
belongs
to
he
offered
it
with
a
bow
and
a
laugh
and
she
took
it
in
the
same
humour
what
is
the
language
of
forceythia
she
asked
it
has
none
only
expressive
silence
you
a
lady
came
in
and
miss
anderson
said
my
aunt
mr
mavering
will
hardly
remember
me
said
the
lady
giving
him
her
hand
he
protested
that
he
should
indeed
but
she
had
really
made
but
a
vague
impression
upon
him
at
campobello
he
knew
that
she
was
there
with
miss
anderson
he
had
been
polite
to
her
as
he
was
to
all
women
but
he
had
not
noticed
her
much
and
in
his
heart
he
had
a
slight
for
her
as
compared
with
the
boston
people
he
was
more
naturally
thrown
with
he
certainly
had
not
remembered
that
she
was
a
little
hard
of
hearing
miss
van
hook
was
in
a
effect
of
dress
and
she
had
carried
this
up
into
her
hair
of
which
she
worn
two
short
vertical
curls
on
each
temple
she
did
not
sit
down
and
dan
perceived
that
the
ladies
were
going
out
in
her
suit
of
serge
and
her
paris
bonnet
carried
like
a
crest
on
her
pretty
little
head
miss
anderson
was
charming
she
had
a
short
veil
that
came
across
the
base
of
her
lively
nose
and
left
her
mouth
and
chin
to
make
the
most
of
themselves
unprejudiced
by
its
irregularity
dan
felt
it
a
hardship
to
part
with
them
but
he
prepared
to
take
himself
off
miss
anderson
asked
him
how
long
he
was
to
be
in
washington
and
said
he
must
come
to
see
them
they
meant
to
stay
two
weeks
yet
and
then
they
were
going
to
old
point
comfort
they
had
their
rooms
engaged
he
walked
down
to
their
carriage
with
the
ladies
and
put
them
into
it
and
miss
anderson
still
kept
him
talking
there
her
aunt
said
why
should
you
come
with
us
mavering
going
to
secretary
miller
dan
gave
himself
a
glance
i
do
know
if
you
want
me
we
want
you
said
miss
anderson
very
well
then
i
he
got
in
and
they
began
rolling
over
that
smooth
washington
asphalt
which
makes
talk
in
a
carriage
as
easy
as
in
a
dan
kept
saying
to
himself
now
she
going
to
bring
up
campobello
but
miss
anderson
never
recurred
to
their
former
meeting
and
except
for
the
sense
of
old
acquaintance
which
was
manifest
in
her
treatment
of
him
he
might
have
thought
that
they
had
never
met
before
she
talked
of
washington
and
its
informal
delights
and
of
those
plans
which
her
aunt
had
made
like
every
one
who
spends
a
month
in
washington
to
spend
all
the
remaining
winters
of
her
life
there
it
seemed
to
dan
that
miss
anderson
was
avoiding
campobello
on
his
account
he
knew
from
what
alice
had
told
him
that
there
had
been
much
surmise
about
their
affair
after
he
had
left
the
island
and
he
suspected
that
miss
anderson
thought
the
subject
was
painful
to
him
he
wished
to
reassure
her
he
asked
at
the
first
break
in
the
talk
about
washington
how
are
the
trevors
oh
quite
well
she
said
promptly
availing
herself
of
the
opening
have
you
seen
any
of
our
campobello
friends
lately
in
boston
no
i
been
at
home
for
the
last
month
in
the
he
scanned
her
face
to
see
if
she
knew
anything
of
his
engagement
but
she
seemed
honestly
ignorant
of
everything
since
campobello
she
was
not
just
the
kind
of
new
york
girl
who
would
visit
in
boston
or
have
friends
living
there
probably
she
had
never
heard
of
his
engagement
somehow
this
seemed
to
simplify
matters
for
dan
she
did
not
ask
specifically
after
the
pasmers
but
that
might
have
been
because
of
the
sort
of
break
in
her
friendship
with
alice
after
that
night
at
the
trevors
she
did
not
ask
specifically
after
brinkley
or
any
of
the
others
at
secretary
miller
door
there
was
a
rapid
arrival
and
departure
of
carriages
of
coupes
of
hansoms
and
of
herdics
all
managed
by
a
man
in
plain
livery
who
opened
and
shut
the
doors
and
sent
the
drivers
off
without
the
intervention
of
a
policeman
it
is
the
genius
of
washington
which
distinguishes
it
from
every
other
capital
from
every
other
city
to
make
no
show
of
formality
of
any
manner
of
constraint
anywhere
people
were
swarming
in
and
out
coming
and
going
on
foot
as
well
as
by
carriage
the
blandest
of
coloured
uncles
received
their
cards
in
the
hall
and
put
them
into
a
vast
tray
heaped
up
with
pasteboard
smiling
affectionately
upon
them
as
if
they
had
done
him
a
favour
do
you
like
them
asked
dan
of
miss
anderson
he
meant
the
southern
negroes
i
adoye
them
she
responded
with
equal
fervour
you
must
study
some
new
types
here
for
next
summer
she
added
dan
laughed
and
winced
too
yes
then
he
said
solemnly
i
am
not
going
to
campobello
next
they
felt
into
a
stream
of
people
tending
toward
an
archway
between
the
where
secretary
miller
stood
with
two
lady
friends
who
were
helping
her
receive
they
smiled
wearily
but
kindly
upon
the
crowd
for
whom
the
secretary
wife
had
a
look
of
impartial
hospitality
she
could
not
have
known
more
than
one
in
fifty
and
she
met
them
all
with
this
look
at
first
breaking
into
incredulous
recognition
when
she
found
a
friend
do
go
away
yet
she
said
cordially
to
miss
van
hook
and
her
niece
and
she
held
their
hands
for
a
moment
with
a
gentle
look
of
relief
and
appeal
which
included
dan
let
me
introduce
you
to
tolliver
and
to
miss
these
ladies
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
regard
to
miss
anderson
and
miss
van
hook
and
as
the
crowd
pushed
them
on
dan
felt
that
they
had
been
received
with
distinction
the
crowd
expressed
the
national
variety
of
rich
and
poor
plain
and
fashionable
urbane
and
rustic
they
elbowed
and
shouldered
each
other
upon
a
perfect
equality
in
a
place
where
all
were
as
free
to
come
as
to
the
white
house
and
they
jostled
quaint
groups
of
legations
in
the
yellows
and
purples
of
the
east
who
looked
dreamily
on
as
if
puzzled
past
all
surmise
by
the
scene
certain
young
gentlemen
with
the
unmistakable
air
of
being
european
or
south
american
attaches
found
their
way
about
on
their
little
feet
which
the
stalwart
boots
of
the
republican
masses
must
have
imperilled
and
smiled
with
a
faint
diplomatic
superiority
not
visibly
admitted
but
all
the
same
indisputable
several
of
these
seemed
to
know
miss
anderson
and
took
her
presentation
of
mavering
with
exaggerated
effusion
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
my
cousin
over
yonder
she
said
getting
rid
of
a
minute
brazilian
and
putting
her
hand
on
arm
to
direct
him
mrs
justice
miss
van
hook
keeping
her
look
of
severe
vigilance
really
followed
her
energetic
niece
who
took
the
lead
as
a
young
lady
must
whenever
she
and
her
chaperon
meet
on
equal
terms
justice
averill
who
was
from
the
far
west
somewhere
received
dan
with
the
ease
of
the
far
east
and
was
talking
london
and
paris
to
him
before
the
end
of
the
third
minute
it
gave
dan
a
sense
of
liberation
of
expansion
he
filled
his
lungs
with
the
cosmopolitan
air
in
a
sort
of
intoxication
without
formulating
it
he
felt
with
the
astonishment
which
must
always
attend
the
bostonian
perception
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
great
social
life
in
america
outside
of
boston
at
campobello
he
had
thought
miss
anderson
a
very
jolly
girl
bright
and
up
to
all
sorts
of
things
but
in
the
presence
of
the
portable
boston
there
he
could
not
help
regarding
her
with
a
sort
of
tolerance
which
he
now
blushed
for
he
thought
he
had
been
a
great
ass
she
seemed
to
know
all
sorts
of
nice
people
and
she
strove
with
generous
hospitality
to
make
him
have
a
good
time
she
said
it
was
cabinet
day
and
that
all
the
secretaries
wives
were
receiving
and
she
told
him
he
had
better
make
the
rounds
with
them
he
assented
very
willingly
and
at
six
he
was
already
so
much
in
the
spirit
of
this
free
and
simple
society
so
much
opener
and
therefore
so
much
wiser
than
any
other
that
he
professed
a
profound
disappointment
with
the
two
or
three
cabinet
ladies
whose
failure
to
receive
brought
his
pleasure
to
a
premature
close
but
i
suppose
you
going
to
whittington
miss
anderson
said
to
him
as
they
drove
up
to
wormley
where
she
set
him
down
miss
van
hook
had
long
ceased
to
say
anything
dan
thought
her
a
perfect
duenna
you
know
you
can
go
late
there
she
added
no
i
ca
go
at
all
said
dan
i
do
know
they
new
england
people
urged
miss
anderson
as
if
to
make
him
try
to
think
that
he
was
asked
to
whittington
i
do
know
more
than
half
the
population
of
new
england
said
dan
with
apparent
levity
but
real
forlornness
if
you
like
to
go
if
you
sure
you
no
other
engagement
oh
i
certain
of
that
we
would
come
for
do
at
ten
miss
anderson
explained
to
her
aunt
who
cordially
confirmed
her
invitation
and
they
both
shook
hands
with
him
upon
it
and
he
backed
out
of
the
carriage
with
a
grin
of
happiness
on
his
face
it
remained
there
while
he
wrote
out
the
order
for
his
dinner
which
they
require
at
wormley
in
holograph
the
waiter
reflected
his
smile
with
ethnical
for
a
moment
dan
tried
to
think
what
it
was
he
had
forgotten
he
thought
it
was
some
other
dish
then
he
remembered
that
it
was
his
broken
heart
he
tried
to
subdue
himself
but
there
was
something
in
the
air
of
the
place
the
climate
perhaps
or
a
pleasant
sense
of
its
facile
social
life
that
kept
him
buoyant
in
spite
of
himself
he
went
out
after
dinner
and
saw
part
of
a
poor
play
and
returned
in
time
to
dress
for
his
appointment
with
miss
anderson
her
aunt
was
with
her
of
course
she
seemed
to
dan
more
indefatigable
than
she
was
by
day
he
could
not
think
her
superfluous
and
she
was
very
she
made
little
remarks
full
of
conventional
wisdom
and
appealed
to
his
judgment
on
several
points
as
they
drove
along
when
they
came
to
a
street
lamp
where
she
could
see
him
he
nodded
and
said
yes
or
no
respectfully
between
times
he
talked
with
miss
anderson
who
lectured
him
upon
washington
society
and
prepared
him
for
the
difference
he
was
to
find
between
whittington
evening
of
invited
guests
and
the
cabinet
ladies
afternoon
of
volunteer
guests
volunteer
guests
is
good
he
laughed
do
you
mean
that
anybody
can
go
anybody
that
is
able
to
be
about
this
is
cabinet
day
there
a
supreme
court
day
and
a
senators
day
and
a
representatives
day
do
you
mean
to
say
you
were
going
to
call
upon
your
senator
i
did
know
i
had
neither
did
i
till
i
came
here
but
you
got
two
everybody
got
two
and
the
president
wife
receives
three
times
a
week
and
the
president
has
two
or
three
days
they
say
the
public
days
at
the
white
house
are
great
fun
i
been
to
some
of
the
invited
or
or
official
he
could
not
see
that
difference
from
the
great
public
receptions
which
miss
anderson
had
promised
him
at
whittington
though
he
pretended
afterward
that
he
had
done
so
the
people
were
more
uniformly
well
dressed
there
were
not
so
many
of
them
and
the
hostess
was
sure
of
knowing
her
acquaintances
at
first
glance
but
there
was
the
same
ease
the
same
unconstraint
the
same
absence
of
provincial
anxiety
which
makes
a
washington
a
lighter
and
friendlier
london
there
were
rather
more
sallow
attaches
in
their
white
waistcoats
with
small
brass
buttons
they
moved
more
consciously
about
and
looked
weightier
personages
than
several
foreign
ministers
who
were
present
dan
was
soon
lost
from
the
side
of
miss
anderson
who
more
and
more
seemed
to
him
important
socially
she
seemed
in
her
present
leadership
to
know
more
of
life
than
he
to
be
maturer
but
she
did
not
abuse
her
superiority
she
kept
an
effect
of
her
last
summer
friendliness
for
him
throughout
several
times
finding
herself
near
him
she
introduced
him
to
people
guests
kept
arriving
till
midnight
among
the
latest
when
dan
had
lost
himself
far
from
boston
in
talk
with
a
young
lady
from
richmond
who
spoke
with
a
slur
of
her
vowels
that
fascinated
him
came
and
brinkley
he
felt
himself
grow
pale
and
inattentive
to
his
pretty
virginian
that
accent
of
brinkley
recalled
him
to
his
history
he
hoped
that
she
would
not
see
him
but
in
another
moment
he
was
greeting
her
with
a
warmth
which
bostonians
seldom
show
in
meeting
at
boston
when
did
you
come
to
washington
she
asked
trying
to
keep
her
consciousness
out
of
her
eyes
which
she
let
dwell
kindly
upon
him
day
before
yesterday
no
yesterday
it
seems
a
month
i
seen
and
done
so
much
he
said
with
his
laugh
miss
anderson
been
showing
me
the
whole
of
washington
society
have
you
been
here
long
since
morning
said
brinkley
and
she
added
miss
anderson
yes
campobello
do
you
know
oh
yes
is
she
here
i
came
with
her
and
her
oh
how
is
all
boston
asked
dan
boldly
i
do
know
i
just
going
down
to
old
point
comfort
to
ask
every
other
house
on
the
back
bay
has
been
abandoned
for
the
brinkley
stopped
and
then
she
asked
are
you
just
up
from
there
no
but
i
do
know
but
i
shall
hello
mavering
said
brinkley
coming
up
and
taking
his
hand
into
his
fat
grasp
on
your
way
to
fortress
monroe
better
come
with
us
why
munt
he
turned
to
greet
this
other
bostonian
who
had
hardly
expressed
his
joy
at
meeting
with
his
when
the
hostess
rustled
softly
up
and
said
with
the
irony
more
or
less
friendly
which
everybody
uses
in
speaking
of
boston
or
recognising
the
intellectual
of
its
people
i
not
going
to
let
you
keep
this
feast
of
reason
all
to
your
selves
i
want
you
to
leaven
the
whole
lump
and
she
began
to
disperse
them
and
to
introduce
them
about
right
and
left
dan
tried
to
find
his
virginian
again
but
she
was
gone
he
found
miss
anderson
she
was
with
her
aunt
shall
we
be
tearing
you
away
she
asked
oh
no
i
quite
ready
to
his
nerves
were
in
a
tremble
those
boston
faces
and
voices
had
brought
it
all
back
again
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
met
alice
he
was
silent
and
incoherent
as
they
drove
home
but
miss
anderson
apparently
did
not
want
to
talk
much
and
apparently
did
not
notice
his
reticence
he
fell
asleep
with
the
pang
in
his
heart
which
had
been
there
so
often
when
dan
came
down
to
breakfast
he
found
the
brinkleys
at
a
pleasant
place
by
one
of
the
windows
and
after
they
had
exchanged
a
pleased
surprise
with
him
that
they
should
all
happen
to
be
in
the
same
hotel
they
asked
him
to
sit
at
their
table
there
was
a
bright
sun
shining
and
the
ache
was
gone
out
of
heart
he
began
to
chatter
gaily
with
brinkley
about
washington
oh
better
come
on
to
fortress
monroe
said
her
husband
better
come
on
with
no
i
ca
just
yet
said
dan
i
got
some
business
here
that
will
keep
me
for
awhile
perhaps
i
may
run
down
there
a
little
miss
anderson
seems
to
have
a
good
deal
of
business
in
washington
too
observed
brinkley
with
some
hazy
notion
of
saying
a
pleasant
rallying
thing
to
the
young
man
he
wondered
at
the
glare
his
wife
gave
him
with
those
panned
oysters
before
him
he
had
forgotten
all
about
dan
love
affair
with
miss
pasmer
brinkley
hastened
to
make
the
mention
of
miss
anderson
as
impersonal
as
possible
it
was
so
nice
to
meet
her
again
she
is
such
an
honest
wholesome
creature
and
so
bright
and
full
of
sense
she
always
made
me
think
of
the
broad
daylight
i
always
liked
that
yes
is
she
jolly
said
dan
joyously
she
seems
to
know
everybody
here
it
a
great
piece
of
luck
for
me
they
going
to
take
a
house
in
washington
next
yes
i
know
that
stage
said
brinkley
her
aunt
an
amusingly
respectability
i
do
think
you
find
just
such
miss
mitford
curls
as
hers
in
all
yes
they
are
like
the
portraits
are
they
said
dan
delighted
she
very
nice
do
you
think
very
but
miss
anderson
is
more
than
that
i
was
disposed
to
be
critical
of
her
at
campobello
for
a
while
but
she
wore
extremely
well
all
at
once
you
found
yourself
admiring
her
uncommon
yes
that
just
it
cried
dan
she
is
so
sensible
i
think
she
very
pretty
said
brinkley
well
her
nose
suggested
dan
it
seems
a
little
it
a
trifle
bizarre
i
suppose
but
what
beautiful
eyes
and
her
figure
i
declare
that
girl
carriage
is
something
yes
she
has
a
magnificent
walks
with
her
carriage
mused
brinkley
aloud
his
wife
did
not
regard
him
i
do
know
what
miss
principles
are
but
her
practices
are
perfect
i
never
knew
her
do
an
unkind
or
shabby
thing
she
seems
very
good
and
very
wise
and
that
deep
voice
of
hers
has
such
a
charm
it
so
restful
you
feel
as
if
you
could
repose
upon
it
for
a
thousand
years
well
you
will
get
down
before
we
leave
yes
i
will
said
dan
i
here
after
a
man
who
after
a
patent
and
as
soon
as
i
can
finish
up
my
business
with
him
i
believe
i
will
run
down
to
fortress
this
train
will
get
you
there
at
six
said
brinkley
better
telegraph
for
your
or
let
us
know
said
brinkley
and
we
secure
them
for
oh
thank
you
said
dan
he
went
away
feeling
that
brinkley
was
the
pleasantest
woman
he
ever
met
he
knew
that
she
had
talked
miss
anderson
so
fully
in
order
to
take
away
the
implication
of
her
husband
joke
and
he
admired
her
tact
he
thought
of
this
as
he
loitered
along
the
street
from
to
the
arlington
where
he
was
going
to
find
miss
anderson
by
an
appointment
of
the
night
before
and
take
a
walk
with
her
and
thinking
of
tact
made
him
think
of
pasmer
pasmer
was
full
of
tact
and
how
kind
she
had
always
been
to
him
she
had
really
been
like
a
mother
to
him
he
was
sure
she
had
understood
him
he
believed
she
had
defended
him
with
a
futility
of
which
he
felt
the
pathos
he
made
her
defend
him
now
to
alice
alice
was
very
hard
and
cold
as
when
he
saw
her
last
her
mother
words
fell
upon
her
as
upon
a
stone
even
pasmer
tears
which
dan
made
her
shed
had
no
effect
upon
the
haughty
girl
not
that
he
cared
now
the
blizzard
of
the
previous
days
had
whirled
away
the
sunshine
lay
still
with
a
warm
glisten
and
sparkle
on
the
asphalt
which
seemed
to
bask
in
it
and
which
it
softened
to
the
foot
he
loitered
by
the
gate
of
the
little
park
or
plantation
where
the
statue
of
general
jackson
is
riding
a
to
banbury
cross
and
looked
over
at
the
classicism
of
the
white
house
architecture
with
a
pensive
joy
at
finding
pleasure
in
it
and
then
he
went
on
to
the
arlington
miss
anderson
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
parlour
and
they
went
a
long
walk
up
the
avenues
and
across
half
the
alphabet
in
the
streets
and
through
the
pretty
squares
and
circles
where
the
statues
were
sometimes
beautiful
and
always
picturesque
and
the
sparrows
made
a
vernal
chirping
in
the
naked
trees
and
on
the
green
grass
in
two
or
three
they
sat
down
on
the
iron
benches
and
rested
they
talked
and
talked
about
the
people
they
knew
and
of
whom
they
found
that
they
thought
surprisingly
alike
and
about
themselves
whom
they
found
surprisingly
alike
in
a
great
many
things
and
then
surprisingly
unlike
dan
brought
forward
some
points
of
identity
which
he
and
alice
had
found
in
themselves
it
was
just
the
same
with
miss
anderson
she
found
herself
rather
warm
with
the
sacque
she
had
put
on
she
let
him
carry
it
on
his
arm
while
they
walked
and
then
lay
it
over
her
shoulders
when
they
sat
down
he
felt
a
pang
of
as
if
he
had
been
inconstant
to
alice
this
was
an
old
habit
of
feeling
formed
during
the
months
of
their
engagement
when
at
her
inspiration
he
was
always
bringing
himself
to
book
about
something
he
replied
to
her
bitterly
in
the
colloquy
which
began
to
hold
itself
in
his
mind
and
told
her
that
she
had
no
claim
upon
him
now
that
if
his
thoughts
wandered
from
her
it
was
her
fault
not
his
that
she
herself
had
set
them
free
but
in
fact
he
was
like
all
young
men
with
a
thousand
potentialities
of
loving
there
was
no
aspect
of
beauty
that
did
not
tenderly
move
him
he
could
not
help
a
soft
thrill
at
the
sight
of
any
pretty
shape
the
sound
of
any
piquant
voice
and
alice
had
merely
been
the
synthesis
of
all
that
was
most
charming
to
this
fancy
this
is
a
truth
which
it
is
the
convention
of
the
poets
and
the
novelists
to
deny
but
it
is
also
true
that
she
might
have
remained
the
sum
of
all
that
was
loveliest
if
she
would
or
if
she
could
it
was
chiefly
because
she
would
not
or
could
not
that
his
glance
recognised
the
charm
of
miss
anderson
back
hair
both
in
its
straying
gossamer
and
in
the
loose
mass
in
which
it
was
caught
up
under
her
hat
when
he
laid
her
sacque
on
her
shoulders
they
met
that
afternoon
at
a
senator
and
in
the
house
of
a
distinguished
citizen
to
whose
wife
dan
had
been
presented
at
whittington
and
who
had
somehow
got
his
address
and
sent
him
a
card
for
her
evening
they
encountered
here
with
a
jocose
old
friendliness
and
a
profession
of
being
tired
of
always
meeting
miss
anderson
and
mavering
he
brought
her
salad
and
ice
and
they
made
an
appointment
for
another
walk
in
the
morning
if
it
was
fine
he
carried
her
some
flowers
a
succession
of
fine
days
followed
and
they
walked
every
morning
sometimes
dan
was
late
and
explained
that
it
was
his
man
had
kept
him
she
was
interested
in
the
man
whom
dan
began
to
find
not
quite
so
simple
as
at
first
but
she
was
not
exacting
with
him
about
his
want
of
punctuality
she
was
very
she
was
not
always
ready
herself
when
he
began
to
beat
about
the
bush
to
talk
insincerities
and
to
lose
himself
in
intentionless
plausibilities
she
waited
with
serene
patience
for
him
to
have
done
and
met
him
on
their
habitual
ground
of
frankness
and
reality
as
if
he
had
not
left
it
he
got
to
telling
her
all
his
steps
with
his
man
who
seemed
to
be
growing
mote
and
more
slippery
and
who
presently
developed
a
demand
for
funds
then
she
gave
him
some
very
shrewd
practical
advice
and
told
him
to
go
right
into
the
hotel
office
and
telegraph
to
his
father
while
she
was
putting
on
her
bonnet
yes
he
said
that
what
i
thought
of
but
he
admired
her
for
advising
him
he
said
to
himself
that
miss
anderson
was
the
kind
of
girl
his
father
would
admire
she
was
good
and
she
was
of
the
world
too
that
was
what
his
father
meant
he
imagined
himself
arriving
home
and
saying
well
father
you
know
that
despatch
i
sent
you
about
wanting
money
and
telling
him
about
miss
anderson
then
he
fancied
her
acquainted
with
his
sisters
and
visiting
them
and
his
father
more
and
more
fond
of
her
and
perhaps
in
declining
health
and
eager
to
see
his
son
settled
in
life
and
he
pictured
himself
telling
her
that
he
had
done
with
love
for
ever
but
if
she
could
accept
respect
fidelity
gratitude
he
was
ready
to
devote
his
life
to
her
she
refused
him
but
they
always
remained
good
friends
and
comrades
she
married
another
perhaps
boardman
while
dan
was
writing
out
his
telegram
and
he
broke
into
whispered
maledictions
on
his
folly
which
attracted
the
notice
of
the
operator
one
morning
when
he
sent
up
his
name
to
miss
anderson
whom
he
did
not
find
in
the
hotel
parlour
the
servant
came
back
with
word
that
miss
van
hook
would
like
to
have
him
come
up
to
their
rooms
but
it
was
miss
anderson
who
met
him
at
the
door
it
seemed
rather
formal
to
send
you
word
that
miss
van
hook
was
indisposed
and
miss
anderson
would
be
unable
to
walk
this
morning
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
rather
come
up
and
get
my
regrets
in
person
and
i
wanted
you
to
see
our
she
led
the
way
to
the
window
for
it
but
they
did
not
look
at
it
though
they
sat
down
there
apparently
for
the
purpose
dan
put
his
hat
beside
his
chair
and
observed
some
inattentive
civilities
in
inquiring
after
miss
van
hook
health
and
in
hearing
that
it
was
merely
a
bad
headache
one
of
a
sort
in
which
her
niece
hated
to
leave
her
to
serve
herself
with
the
wet
compresses
which
miss
van
hook
always
bore
on
her
forehead
for
it
one
thing
it
decided
us
to
be
off
for
fortress
monroe
at
last
we
shall
go
by
the
boat
if
my
aunt
said
dan
what
to
become
of
me
when
you
gone
oh
we
shall
not
take
the
whole
population
with
us
suggested
miss
anderson
i
wish
you
would
take
me
i
told
brinkley
i
would
come
while
she
was
there
but
i
afraid
i
ca
get
off
lafflin
is
developing
into
all
sorts
of
strange
i
think
you
better
look
out
for
that
man
said
miss
anderson
oh
i
do
nothing
without
consulting
my
father
but
i
shall
miss
thank
you
said
the
girl
gravely
i
do
mean
in
a
business
capacity
they
both
laughed
and
dan
looked
about
the
room
which
he
found
was
a
private
hotel
parlour
softened
to
a
more
domestic
effect
by
the
signs
of
its
prolonged
occupation
by
two
refined
women
on
a
table
stood
a
leather
photograph
envelope
with
three
cabinet
pictures
in
it
along
the
top
lay
a
spray
of
withered
forceythia
dan
wandering
eyes
rested
on
it
miss
anderson
went
and
softly
closed
the
door
opening
into
the
next
room
i
was
afraid
our
talking
might
disturb
my
aunt
she
said
and
on
her
way
back
to
him
she
picked
up
the
photograph
case
and
brought
it
to
the
light
these
are
my
father
and
mother
we
live
at
yonkers
but
i
with
my
aunt
a
good
deal
of
the
time
in
town
even
when
i
at
she
laughed
at
her
own
contradictory
statement
and
put
the
case
back
without
explaining
the
third
figure
a
figure
in
uniform
dan
conjectured
a
military
brother
or
from
her
indifference
perhaps
a
militia
brother
and
then
forgot
about
him
but
the
partial
yonkers
residence
accounted
for
traits
of
unconventionality
in
miss
anderson
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
reconcile
with
the
notion
of
an
exclusively
new
york
breeding
he
felt
the
relief
the
sympathy
the
certainty
of
intelligence
which
every
person
whose
life
has
been
partly
spent
in
the
country
feels
at
finding
that
a
suspected
cockney
has
also
had
the
outlook
into
nature
and
simplicity
on
the
yonkers
basis
they
became
more
intimate
more
personal
and
dan
told
her
about
ponkwasset
falls
and
his
mother
and
sisters
he
told
her
about
his
father
and
she
said
she
should
like
to
see
his
father
she
thought
he
must
be
like
her
father
all
at
once
and
for
no
reason
that
he
could
think
of
afterward
except
perhaps
the
desire
to
see
the
case
with
her
eyes
he
began
to
tell
her
of
his
affair
with
alice
and
how
and
why
it
was
broken
off
he
told
the
whole
truth
in
regard
to
that
and
did
not
spare
himself
she
listened
without
once
speaking
but
without
apparent
surprise
at
the
confidence
though
she
may
have
felt
surprised
at
times
she
looked
as
if
her
thoughts
were
away
from
what
he
was
saying
he
ended
with
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
told
you
all
this
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
about
me
the
miss
anderson
said
looking
down
i
always
thought
she
was
a
very
conscientious
then
after
a
pause
in
which
she
seemed
to
be
overcoming
an
embarrassment
in
being
obliged
to
speak
of
another
in
such
a
conviction
i
think
she
was
very
moybid
she
was
like
ever
so
many
new
england
giyls
that
i
met
they
seem
to
want
some
excuse
for
suffering
and
they
must
suffer
even
if
it
through
somebody
else
i
do
know
they
romantic
new
england
giyls
are
they
have
too
many
dan
felt
a
balm
in
this
he
too
had
noticed
a
superfluity
of
ideals
in
alice
he
had
borne
the
burden
of
realising
some
of
them
they
all
seemed
to
relate
in
objectionable
degree
to
his
perfectionation
so
he
said
gloomily
she
was
very
good
and
i
was
to
oh
yes
said
miss
anderson
catching
her
breath
in
a
queer
way
she
seyved
you
she
rose
abruptly
as
if
she
heard
her
aunt
speak
and
dan
perceived
that
he
had
been
making
a
long
call
he
went
away
dazed
and
dissatisfied
he
knew
now
that
he
ought
not
to
have
told
miss
anderson
about
his
affair
unless
he
meant
more
by
his
confidence
than
he
really
did
unless
he
meant
to
follow
it
up
he
took
leave
of
her
and
asked
her
to
make
his
adieux
to
her
aunt
but
the
next
day
he
came
down
to
the
boat
to
see
them
off
it
seemed
to
him
that
their
interview
had
ended
too
hastily
he
felt
sore
and
restless
over
it
he
hoped
that
something
more
conclusive
might
happen
but
at
the
boat
miss
anderson
and
her
aunt
were
inseparable
miss
van
hook
said
she
hoped
they
should
soon
see
him
at
the
hygeia
and
he
replied
that
he
was
not
sure
that
he
should
be
able
to
come
after
all
miss
anderson
called
something
after
him
as
he
turned
from
them
to
go
ashore
he
ran
back
eagerly
to
know
what
it
was
better
lookout
for
that
lafflin
of
yours
she
repeated
oh
oh
yes
he
said
indefinitely
disappointed
i
shall
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
he
was
disappointed
but
he
could
not
have
said
what
he
had
hoped
or
expected
her
to
say
he
was
humbled
before
himself
for
having
told
miss
anderson
about
his
affair
with
alice
and
had
wished
she
would
say
something
that
he
might
scramble
back
to
his
upon
he
had
told
her
all
that
partly
from
mere
weakness
from
his
longing
for
the
sympathy
which
he
was
always
so
ready
to
give
and
partly
from
the
willingness
to
pose
before
her
as
a
broken
heart
to
dazzle
her
by
the
irony
and
persiflage
with
which
he
could
treat
such
a
tragical
matter
but
he
could
not
feel
that
he
had
succeeded
the
sum
of
her
comment
had
been
that
alice
had
served
him
right
he
did
not
know
whether
she
really
believed
that
or
merely
said
it
to
punish
him
for
some
reason
but
he
could
never
let
it
be
the
last
word
he
tingled
as
he
turned
to
wave
his
handkerchief
to
her
on
the
boat
with
the
suspicion
that
she
was
laughing
at
him
and
he
could
not
console
himself
with
any
hero
of
a
novel
who
had
got
himself
into
just
such
a
box
there
were
always
circumstances
incidents
mitigations
that
kept
the
hero
still
a
hero
and
ennobled
the
box
into
an
unjust
prison
cell
on
the
long
sunny
piazza
of
the
hygeia
brinkley
and
miss
van
hook
sat
and
talked
in
a
community
of
interest
which
they
had
not
discovered
during
the
summer
before
at
campobello
and
with
an
equality
of
hearing
which
the
sound
of
the
waves
washing
almost
at
their
feet
established
between
them
in
this
pleasant
noise
miss
van
hook
heard
as
well
as
any
one
and
brinkley
gradually
realised
that
it
was
the
trouble
of
having
to
lift
her
voice
that
had
kept
her
from
cultivating
a
very
agreeable
acquaintance
before
the
ladies
sat
in
a
secluded
corner
wearing
light
wraps
that
they
had
often
found
comfortable
at
campobello
in
august
and
from
time
to
time
attested
to
each
other
their
astonishment
that
they
needed
no
more
at
old
point
in
early
april
they
did
this
not
only
as
a
just
tribute
to
the
amiable
climate
but
as
a
relief
from
the
topic
which
had
been
absorbing
them
and
to
which
they
constantly
returned
no
said
brinkley
with
a
sort
of
finality
i
think
it
is
the
best
thing
that
could
possibly
have
happened
to
him
he
is
bearing
it
in
a
very
manly
way
but
i
fancy
he
has
felt
it
deeply
poor
fellow
never
been
in
boston
since
and
i
do
believe
he
come
here
if
any
idea
how
many
boston
people
there
were
in
the
hotel
we
swarm
it
would
be
very
painful
to
yes
said
miss
van
hook
young
people
seem
to
feel
those
of
course
he
going
to
get
over
it
that
what
young
people
do
too
at
his
age
he
ca
help
being
caught
with
every
pretty
face
and
every
pretty
figure
even
in
the
midst
of
his
woe
and
it
only
a
question
of
time
till
he
seizes
some
pretty
hand
and
gets
drawn
out
of
it
i
think
that
would
be
the
case
with
my
niece
too
said
miss
van
hook
if
she
was
kept
in
it
by
a
sense
of
loyalty
i
do
believe
she
really
dares
much
for
lieutenant
willing
any
more
but
he
sees
no
society
where
he
stationed
of
course
and
his
constancy
is
a
a
rebuke
and
a
a
an
incentive
to
her
they
were
engaged
a
long
time
ago
just
after
he
left
west
point
and
we
always
been
in
hopes
that
he
would
be
removed
to
some
post
where
he
could
meet
other
ladies
and
become
interested
in
some
one
else
but
he
never
has
and
so
the
affair
remains
it
most
undesirable
they
should
marry
and
in
the
meantime
she
wo
break
it
off
and
it
spoiling
her
chances
in
it
is
too
bad
sighed
brinkley
but
of
course
you
can
do
nothing
i
see
no
we
can
do
nothing
we
have
tried
everything
i
used
to
think
it
was
because
she
was
so
dull
there
at
yonkers
with
her
family
and
brooded
upon
the
one
idea
all
the
time
that
she
could
not
get
over
it
and
at
first
it
did
seem
when
she
came
to
me
that
she
would
get
over
it
she
is
very
fond
of
gaiety
of
young
men
society
and
she
had
plenty
of
little
flirtations
that
did
mean
anything
and
never
amounted
to
anything
every
now
and
then
a
letter
would
come
from
the
wilds
where
he
was
stationed
and
spoil
it
all
she
seemed
to
feel
a
sort
of
chivalrous
obligation
because
he
was
so
far
off
and
helpless
and
yes
i
understand
said
brinkley
what
a
pity
she
could
be
made
to
feel
that
that
did
deepen
the
obligation
at
i
tried
to
make
her
said
miss
van
hook
and
i
been
everywhere
with
her
one
winter
we
were
up
the
nile
and
another
in
nice
and
last
winter
we
were
in
rome
she
met
young
men
everywhere
and
had
offers
upon
offers
but
it
was
of
no
use
she
remained
just
the
same
and
till
she
met
mavering
in
washington
i
do
believe
miss
van
hook
stopped
and
brinkley
said
and
yet
she
always
seemed
to
me
particularly
practical
and
as
the
men
so
she
is
but
she
is
really
very
romantic
about
some
things
and
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
that
kind
girls
are
about
all
alike
do
you
think
oh
yes
said
brinkley
hopelessly
and
both
ladies
looked
out
over
the
water
where
the
waves
came
rolling
in
one
after
another
to
waste
themselves
on
the
shore
as
futilely
as
if
they
had
been
lives
in
the
evening
miss
anderson
got
two
letters
from
the
clerk
at
the
hour
when
the
ladies
all
flocked
to
his
desk
with
the
eagerness
for
letters
which
is
so
engaging
in
them
one
she
pulled
open
and
glanced
at
with
a
sort
of
impassioned
indifference
the
other
she
read
in
one
intense
moment
and
then
ran
it
into
her
pocket
and
with
her
hand
still
on
it
hurried
vividly
flushing
to
her
room
and
read
and
read
it
again
with
constantly
mounting
emotion
wormley
hotel
washington
april
dear
miss
anderson
i
have
been
acting
on
your
parting
advice
to
look
out
for
that
lafflin
of
mine
and
i
have
discovered
that
he
is
an
unmitigated
scamp
consequently
there
is
nothing
more
to
keep
me
in
washington
and
i
should
now
like
your
advice
about
coming
to
fortress
monroe
do
you
find
it
malarial
on
the
boat
your
aunt
asked
me
to
come
but
you
said
nothing
about
it
and
i
was
left
to
suppose
that
you
did
not
think
it
would
agree
with
me
do
you
still
think
so
or
what
do
you
think
i
know
you
think
it
was
uncalled
for
and
in
extremely
bad
taste
for
me
to
tell
you
what
i
did
the
other
day
and
i
have
thought
so
too
there
is
only
one
thing
that
could
justify
it
that
is
i
think
it
might
justify
it
if
you
thought
so
but
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
you
would
like
to
know
it
or
if
you
knew
it
would
like
it
i
been
rather
slow
coming
to
the
conclusion
myself
and
perhaps
it
only
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
not
the
conclusion
if
there
is
such
a
difference
but
the
question
now
is
whether
i
may
come
and
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
justify
myself
or
make
things
worse
than
they
are
now
i
do
know
that
they
can
be
worse
but
i
think
i
should
like
to
try
i
think
your
presence
would
inspire
me
washington
is
a
wilderness
since
miss
van
hook
left
it
is
not
a
howling
wilderness
simply
because
it
has
not
enough
left
in
it
to
howl
but
it
has
all
the
other
merits
of
a
wilderness
yours
sincerely
d
after
a
second
perusal
of
this
note
miss
anderson
recurred
to
the
other
letter
which
she
had
neglected
for
it
and
read
it
with
eyes
from
which
the
tears
slowly
fell
upon
it
then
she
sat
a
long
time
at
her
table
with
both
letters
before
her
and
did
not
move
except
to
take
her
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
and
dry
her
eyes
from
which
the
tears
began
at
once
to
drip
again
at
last
she
started
forward
and
caught
pen
and
paper
toward
her
biting
her
lip
and
frowning
as
if
to
keep
herself
firm
and
she
said
to
the
central
figure
in
the
photograph
case
which
stood
at
the
back
of
the
table
i
will
i
will
you
are
a
man
she
sat
down
and
by
a
series
of
impulses
she
wrote
a
letter
with
which
she
gave
herself
no
pause
till
she
put
it
in
the
clerk
hands
to
whom
she
ran
downstairs
with
it
kicking
her
skirt
into
wild
whirls
as
she
ran
and
catching
her
foot
in
it
and
stumbling
will
it
go
go
she
demanded
tragically
just
in
time
said
the
clerk
without
looking
up
and
apparently
not
thinking
that
her
tone
betrayed
any
unusual
amount
of
emotion
in
a
lady
posting
a
letter
he
was
used
to
intensity
on
such
occasions
the
letter
ran
dear
mavering
we
shall
now
be
here
so
short
a
time
that
i
do
not
think
it
advisable
for
you
to
come
your
letter
was
rather
enigmatical
and
i
do
not
know
whether
i
understood
it
exactly
i
suppose
you
told
me
what
you
did
for
good
reasons
of
your
own
and
i
did
not
think
much
about
it
i
believe
the
question
of
taste
did
not
come
up
in
my
mind
my
aunt
joins
me
in
kindest
regards
yours
very
sincerely
julia
anderson
i
think
that
i
ought
to
return
your
letter
i
know
that
you
would
not
object
to
my
keeping
it
but
it
does
not
seem
right
i
wish
to
ask
your
congratulations
i
have
been
engaged
for
several
years
to
lieutenant
willing
of
the
army
he
has
been
transferred
from
his
post
in
montana
to
fort
hamilton
at
new
york
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
next
morning
brinkley
came
up
from
breakfast
in
a
sort
of
duplex
excitement
which
she
tried
to
impart
to
her
husband
he
stood
with
his
back
toward
the
door
bending
forward
to
the
glass
for
a
more
accurate
view
of
his
face
from
which
he
had
scraped
half
the
lather
in
shaving
she
had
two
cards
in
her
hand
miss
van
hook
and
miss
anderson
have
gone
they
went
this
morning
i
found
their
by
my
brinkley
made
an
inarticulate
noise
for
comment
and
assumed
the
contemptuous
sneer
which
some
men
find
convenient
for
shaving
the
lower
lip
and
guess
who
come
of
all
people
in
the
world
i
do
know
said
brinkley
seizing
his
chance
to
speak
the
pasmers
alice
and
her
mother
is
it
awful
brinkley
had
entered
upon
a
very
difficult
spot
at
the
corner
of
his
left
jaw
he
finished
it
before
he
said
i
do
see
anything
awful
about
it
so
long
as
pasmer
has
come
but
dan
mavering
he
in
washington
and
he
may
come
down
here
any
day
just
think
how
shocking
that
would
be
is
that
rather
a
theory
asked
brinkley
finding
such
opportunities
for
conversation
as
he
could
i
dare
say
pasmer
would
be
very
glad
to
see
i
no
doubt
she
would
said
brinkley
but
it
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
for
him
and
i
feel
like
writing
him
not
to
come
telegraphing
you
know
how
the
man
made
a
fortune
in
chicago
said
her
husband
drying
his
razor
tenderly
on
a
towel
before
beginning
to
strop
it
i
advise
you
to
let
the
whole
thing
alone
it
does
concern
us
in
any
way
then
said
brinkley
there
ought
to
be
a
committee
to
take
it
in
hand
and
warn
i
dare
say
you
could
make
one
up
among
the
ladies
but
do
be
the
first
to
move
in
the
i
really
believe
said
his
wife
with
her
mind
taken
off
the
point
by
the
attractiveness
of
a
surmise
which
had
just
occurred
to
her
that
pasmer
would
be
capable
of
following
him
down
if
she
knew
he
was
in
yes
if
she
know
but
she
probably
yes
said
brinkley
disappointedly
i
think
the
sudden
departure
of
the
van
hooks
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
dan
seems
a
very
influential
young
man
said
her
husband
he
attracts
and
repels
people
right
and
left
did
you
speak
to
the
pasmers
no
you
better
when
you
go
down
they
just
come
into
the
the
girl
looks
like
well
i
talk
to
her
about
mavering
that
cheer
her
brinkley
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
as
if
she
really
thought
him
capable
of
it
then
she
joined
him
in
his
laugh
brinkley
had
theorised
alice
pasmer
as
simply
and
primitively
selfish
like
the
rest
of
the
pasmers
in
whom
the
family
traits
prevailed
when
mavering
stopped
coming
to
her
house
after
his
engagement
she
justly
suspected
that
it
was
because
alice
had
forbidden
him
and
she
had
rejoiced
at
the
broken
engagement
as
an
escape
for
dan
she
had
frankly
said
so
and
she
had
received
him
back
into
full
favour
at
the
first
moment
in
washington
she
liked
miss
anderson
and
she
had
hoped
with
the
interest
which
women
feel
in
every
such
affair
that
her
flirtation
with
him
might
become
serious
but
now
this
had
apparently
not
happened
julia
anderson
was
gone
with
mystifying
precipitation
and
alice
pasmer
had
come
with
an
unexpectedness
which
had
the
aspect
of
fatality
brinkley
felt
bound
of
course
since
there
was
no
open
enmity
between
them
to
meet
the
pasmers
on
the
neutral
ground
of
the
hygeia
with
conventional
amiability
she
was
really
touched
by
the
absent
wanness
of
the
girls
look
and
by
the
recognition
which
shaped
her
mouth
into
a
pathetic
snide
alice
did
not
look
like
death
quite
as
brinkley
had
told
her
husband
with
the
necessity
her
sex
has
for
putting
its
superlatives
before
its
positives
but
she
was
pale
and
thin
and
she
moved
with
a
languid
step
when
they
all
met
at
night
after
brinkley
had
kept
out
of
the
pasmers
way
during
the
day
she
has
been
ill
all
the
latter
part
of
the
winter
said
pasmer
to
brinkley
that
night
in
the
corner
of
the
spreading
hotel
parlours
where
they
found
themselves
pasmer
did
not
look
well
herself
she
spoke
with
her
eyes
fixed
anxiously
on
the
door
alice
had
just
passed
out
of
she
is
going
to
bed
but
i
know
i
shall
find
her
awake
whenever
i
perhaps
suggested
brinkley
this
soft
heavy
sea
air
will
put
her
to
she
tried
to
speak
drily
and
indifferently
but
she
could
not
she
was
in
fact
very
much
interested
by
the
situation
and
she
was
touched
in
spite
of
her
distaste
for
them
both
by
the
evident
unhappiness
of
mother
and
daughter
she
knew
what
it
came
from
and
she
said
to
herself
that
they
deserved
it
but
this
did
not
altogether
fortify
her
against
their
pathos
i
can
hardly
keep
awake
myself
she
added
gruffly
i
hope
it
may
help
her
said
pasmer
the
doctor
strongly
urged
our
mr
pasmer
is
with
you
said
brinkley
feeling
that
it
was
decent
to
say
something
about
him
no
he
was
pasmer
did
not
explain
the
cause
of
his
detention
and
the
two
ladies
slowly
waved
their
fans
a
moment
in
silence
are
there
many
boston
people
in
the
house
pasmer
asked
it
full
of
them
cried
brinkley
i
had
scarcely
noticed
sighed
pasmer
and
brinkley
knew
that
this
was
not
true
alice
takes
up
all
my
thoughts
she
added
and
this
might
be
true
enough
she
leaned
a
little
forward
and
asked
in
a
low
entreating
voice
over
her
fan
mrs
brinkley
have
you
seen
mavering
lately
brinkley
considered
this
a
little
too
bold
a
little
too
brazen
had
they
actually
come
south
in
pursuit
of
him
it
was
shameless
and
she
let
pasmer
know
something
of
her
feeling
in
the
shortness
with
which
she
answered
i
saw
him
in
washington
the
other
day
for
a
she
shortened
the
time
she
had
spent
in
dan
company
so
as
to
cut
pasmer
off
from
as
much
comfort
as
possible
and
she
stared
at
her
in
open
astonishment
pasmer
dropped
her
eyes
and
fingered
the
edge
of
her
fan
with
a
submissiveness
that
seemed
to
brinkley
the
perfection
of
duplicity
she
wanted
to
shake
her
i
knew
sighed
pasmer
that
you
had
always
been
such
a
friend
of
it
is
the
last
straw
which
breaks
the
camel
back
brinkley
felt
her
moral
vertebrae
give
way
she
almost
heard
them
crack
but
if
there
was
really
a
detonation
the
drowned
the
noise
with
a
harsh
laugh
oh
he
had
other
friends
in
washington
i
met
him
everywhere
with
miss
this
statement
conflicted
with
the
theory
of
her
single
instant
with
dan
but
she
felt
that
in
such
a
cause
in
the
cause
of
giving
pain
to
a
woman
like
pasmer
the
deflection
from
exact
truth
was
justifiable
she
hurried
on
i
rather
expected
he
might
run
down
here
but
now
that
they
gone
i
do
suppose
he
come
you
remember
miss
anderson
aunt
miss
van
hook
oh
yes
said
pasmer
she
was
here
with
miss
van
hook
was
such
a
new
york
type
of
a
certain
kind
said
pasmer
she
rose
with
a
smile
at
once
so
conventional
so
heroic
and
so
pitiful
that
brinkley
felt
the
remorse
of
a
generous
victor
she
went
to
her
room
hardening
her
heart
and
she
burst
in
with
a
flood
of
voluble
exasperation
that
threatened
all
the
neighbouring
rooms
with
overflow
well
she
cried
they
have
shown
their
hands
completely
they
have
come
here
to
hound
dan
mavering
down
and
get
him
into
their
toils
again
why
the
woman
actually
said
as
much
but
i
fancy
i
have
given
her
a
fit
of
insomnia
that
will
enable
her
to
share
her
vigils
really
such
impudence
i
never
heard
of
do
you
want
everybody
in
the
corridor
to
hear
of
it
asked
brinkley
from
behind
a
newspaper
i
know
one
thing
continued
brinkley
dropping
her
voice
a
couple
of
octaves
they
will
never
get
him
here
if
i
can
help
it
he
come
anyway
now
miss
anderson
is
gone
but
i
make
assurance
doubly
sure
by
writing
him
not
to
come
i
tell
him
they
gone
and
than
we
are
going
you
had
better
remember
the
man
in
chicago
said
her
husband
well
this
is
my
business
or
i
make
it
my
business
cried
brinkley
she
went
on
talking
rapidly
rising
with
great
excitement
in
her
voice
at
times
and
then
remembering
to
speak
lower
and
her
husband
apparently
read
on
through
most
of
her
talk
though
now
and
then
he
made
some
comment
that
seemed
of
almost
inspired
aptness
the
way
they
both
made
up
to
me
was
disgusting
but
i
know
the
girl
is
just
a
tool
in
her
mother
hands
her
mother
seemed
actually
passive
in
comparison
for
skilful
wheedling
i
could
fall
down
and
worship
that
woman
i
really
admire
her
as
long
as
the
girl
was
with
us
she
kept
herself
in
the
background
and
put
the
girl
at
me
it
was
simply
a
how
do
you
know
she
put
her
at
you
asked
brinkley
how
by
the
way
she
seemed
not
to
do
it
and
because
from
what
i
know
of
that
stupid
pasmer
pride
it
would
be
perfectly
impossible
for
any
one
who
was
a
pasmer
to
take
her
deprecatory
manner
toward
me
of
herself
you
ought
to
have
seen
it
it
was
simply
perhaps
said
brinkley
with
a
remote
dreaminess
she
was
truly
truly
stuff
no
indeed
she
hates
me
as
much
as
ever
more
well
then
may
be
she
doing
it
because
she
hates
you
doing
it
for
her
soul
good
sort
of
penance
sort
of
atonement
to
brinkley
turned
round
from
her
to
see
what
her
husband
meant
but
the
newspaper
hid
him
we
all
know
that
our
own
natures
are
mixed
and
contradictory
but
we
each
attribute
to
others
a
logical
consistency
which
we
never
find
in
any
one
out
of
the
novels
alice
pasmer
was
cold
and
reticent
and
brinkley
who
had
lived
half
a
century
in
a
world
full
of
paradoxes
could
not
imagine
her
subject
to
gusts
of
passionate
frankness
she
knew
the
girl
to
be
proud
and
distant
and
she
could
not
conceive
of
an
abject
humility
and
longing
for
sympathy
in
her
heart
if
alice
felt
when
she
saw
brinkley
that
she
had
a
providential
opportunity
to
punish
herself
for
her
injustice
to
dan
the
fact
could
not
be
established
upon
brinkley
theory
of
her
if
the
ascetic
impulse
is
the
most
purely
selfish
impulse
in
human
nature
brinkley
might
not
have
been
mistaken
in
suspecting
her
of
an
ignoble
motive
though
it
might
have
had
for
the
girl
the
last
sublimity
of
the
woman
who
disliked
her
and
pitied
her
knew
that
she
had
no
arts
and
rather
than
adopt
so
simple
a
theory
of
her
behaviour
as
her
husband
had
advanced
she
held
all
the
more
strenuously
to
her
own
theory
that
alice
was
practising
her
mother
arts
this
was
inevitable
partly
from
the
sense
of
pasmer
artfulness
which
everybody
had
and
partly
from
the
allegiance
which
we
pay
and
women
especially
like
to
pay
to
the
tradition
of
the
playwrights
and
the
novelists
that
social
results
of
all
kinds
are
the
work
of
deep
and
more
or
less
darkling
design
on
the
part
of
other
women
such
other
women
as
pasmer
brinkley
continued
to
talk
but
the
god
spoke
no
more
from
behind
the
newspaper
and
afterward
brinkley
lay
a
long
time
awake
hardening
her
heart
but
she
was
haunted
to
the
verge
of
her
dreams
by
that
girl
sick
look
by
her
languid
walk
and
by
the
effect
which
she
had
seen
her
own
words
take
upon
pasmer
an
effect
so
admirably
disowned
so
perfectly
obvious
before
she
could
get
to
sleep
she
was
obliged
to
make
a
compromise
with
her
heart
in
pursuance
of
which
when
she
found
pasmer
at
breakfast
alone
in
the
morning
she
went
up
to
her
and
said
holding
her
hand
a
moment
i
hope
your
daughter
slept
well
last
no
said
pasmer
slipping
her
hand
away
i
ca
say
that
she
there
was
probably
no
resentment
expressed
in
the
way
she
withdrew
her
hand
but
the
other
thought
there
was
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
her
she
cried
oh
thank
you
said
pasmer
it
very
good
of
and
brinkley
fancied
she
smiled
rather
bitterly
brinkley
went
out
upon
the
seaward
verandah
of
the
hotel
with
this
bitterness
of
pasmer
smile
in
her
thoughts
and
it
disposed
her
to
feel
more
keenly
the
quality
of
miss
pasmer
smile
she
found
the
girl
standing
there
at
a
remote
point
of
that
long
stretch
of
planking
and
looking
out
over
the
water
she
held
with
both
hands
across
her
breast
the
soft
chuddah
shawl
which
the
wind
caught
and
fluttered
away
from
her
waist
she
was
alone
said
as
brinkley
compunctions
goaded
her
nearer
she
fancied
that
the
saw
alice
master
a
primary
dislike
in
her
face
and
put
on
a
look
of
pathetic
propitiation
she
did
not
come
forward
to
meet
brinkley
who
liked
better
her
waiting
to
be
approached
but
she
smiled
gratefully
when
brinkley
put
out
her
hand
and
she
took
it
with
a
very
cold
one
you
must
find
it
chilly
here
said
the
elder
woman
i
had
better
be
out
in
the
air
all
i
could
the
doctor
said
answered
alice
well
then
come
with
me
round
the
corner
there
a
sort
of
recess
there
and
you
wo
be
blown
to
pierces
said
brinkley
with
authority
they
sat
down
together
in
the
recess
and
she
added
i
used
to
sit
here
with
miss
van
hook
she
could
hear
better
in
the
noise
the
waves
made
i
hope
it
is
too
much
for
oh
no
said
alice
mamma
said
you
told
her
they
were
brinkley
reassured
herself
from
this
miss
van
hook
name
had
rather
slipped
out
but
of
course
pasmer
had
not
repeated
what
she
had
said
about
dan
in
this
connection
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
julia
alice
went
on
it
would
have
been
quite
like
campobello
oh
quite
said
brinkley
with
a
short
breath
and
not
knowing
whither
this
tended
alice
did
not
leave
her
in
doubt
i
should
like
to
have
seen
her
and
begged
her
for
the
way
i
treated
her
the
last
part
of
the
time
there
i
feel
as
if
i
could
make
my
whole
life
a
reparation
she
added
passionately
brinkley
believed
that
this
was
the
mere
frenzy
of
sentimentality
the
exaltation
of
a
selfish
asceticism
but
at
the
break
in
the
voice
and
the
aversion
of
her
face
she
could
not
help
a
thrill
of
motherly
tenderness
for
her
she
wanted
to
tell
her
she
was
an
unconscious
humbug
bent
now
as
always
on
her
own
advantage
and
really
indifferent
to
others
she
also
wanted
to
comfort
her
and
tell
her
that
she
exaggerated
and
was
not
to
blame
she
did
neither
but
when
alice
turned
her
face
back
she
seemed
encouraged
by
brinkley
look
to
go
on
i
did
appreciate
her
then
she
was
very
generous
and
too
for
me
to
understand
even
but
we
seem
to
know
how
good
others
are
till
we
wrong
yes
that
is
very
true
said
brinkley
she
knew
that
alice
was
obviously
referring
to
the
breach
between
herself
and
miss
anderson
following
the
night
of
the
trevor
theatricals
and
the
dislike
for
her
that
she
had
shown
with
a
frankness
some
of
the
ladies
had
thought
brutal
brinkley
also
believed
that
her
words
had
a
tacit
meaning
and
she
would
have
liked
to
have
the
hardness
to
say
she
had
seen
an
unnamed
victim
of
alice
doing
his
best
to
console
the
other
she
had
specified
but
she
merely
said
drily
yes
perhaps
that
the
reason
why
we
allowed
to
injure
it
must
be
said
alice
simply
did
miss
anderson
ever
speak
of
me
no
i
ca
remember
that
she
ever
brinkley
did
not
feel
bound
to
say
that
she
and
miss
van
hook
had
discussed
her
at
large
and
agreed
perfectly
about
her
i
should
like
to
see
her
i
should
like
to
write
to
brinkley
felt
that
she
ought
not
to
suffer
this
intimate
tendency
in
the
talk
you
must
find
a
great
many
other
acquaintances
in
the
hotel
miss
some
of
the
frankland
girds
are
here
and
the
two
bellinghams
i
have
hardly
spoken
to
them
yet
do
you
think
that
where
you
have
even
been
in
the
right
if
you
have
been
harsh
if
you
have
been
hasty
if
you
have
made
allowances
you
ought
to
offer
some
atonement
really
i
ca
say
said
brinkley
with
a
smile
of
distaste
i
afraid
your
question
is
quite
in
my
line
of
thinking
it
more
in
miss
cotton
way
you
better
ask
her
some
no
said
alice
sadly
she
would
flatter
ah
i
always
supposed
she
was
very
she
conscientious
but
she
likes
me
too
oh
commented
brinkley
to
herself
then
you
know
i
do
like
you
and
you
use
me
in
one
way
if
you
ca
in
another
very
well
but
she
found
the
girl
trust
touching
somehow
though
the
sentimentality
of
her
appeal
seemed
as
tawdry
as
ever
i
knew
you
would
be
just
added
alice
wistfully
oh
i
do
know
about
atonements
said
brinkley
with
an
effect
of
carelessness
it
seems
to
me
that
we
usually
make
them
for
our
own
i
have
thought
of
that
said
alice
with
a
look
of
expectation
and
we
usually
astonish
other
people
when
we
offer
either
they
do
like
it
or
else
they
do
feel
so
much
injured
as
we
had
oh
but
there
no
question
if
miss
anderson
miss
anderson
oh
oh
yes
if
miss
anderson
for
example
pursued
brinkley
felt
aggrieved
with
you
but
really
i
no
right
to
enter
into
your
affairs
miss
oh
yes
yes
do
i
asked
you
to
the
girl
implored
i
doubt
if
it
will
help
matters
for
her
to
know
that
you
regret
anything
and
if
she
should
happen
to
have
thought
that
you
were
unjust
to
her
it
would
make
her
uncomfortable
for
do
you
think
so
asked
the
girl
with
a
disappointment
that
betrayed
itself
in
her
voice
and
eyes
i
never
feel
i
myself
competent
to
advise
said
brinkley
i
can
criticise
anybody
can
and
i
do
pretty
freely
but
advice
is
a
more
serious
matter
each
of
us
must
act
from
herself
from
what
she
thinks
is
yes
i
see
thank
you
so
much
after
all
we
have
a
right
to
do
ourselves
good
even
when
we
pretend
that
it
good
to
others
if
we
do
do
them
any
yes
i
alice
looked
away
and
then
seemed
about
to
speak
again
but
one
of
brinkley
acquaintance
came
up
and
the
girl
rose
with
a
frightened
air
and
went
away
alice
talk
with
you
this
morning
did
her
so
much
good
said
pasmer
later
she
has
always
felt
so
badly
about
miss
anderson
brinkley
saw
that
pasmer
wished
to
confine
the
meaning
of
their
talk
to
miss
anderson
and
she
assented
with
a
penetration
of
which
she
saw
that
pasmer
was
gratefully
aware
she
grew
more
tolerant
of
both
the
pasmers
as
the
danger
of
greater
intimacy
from
them
which
seemed
to
threaten
at
first
seemed
to
pass
away
she
had
not
responded
to
their
advances
but
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
civil
to
them
there
had
never
been
any
open
quarrel
with
them
she
often
found
herself
in
talk
with
them
and
was
amused
to
note
that
she
was
the
only
bostonian
whom
they
did
not
keep
aloof
from
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
came
to
like
either
of
them
better
she
still
suspected
pasmer
of
design
though
she
developed
none
beyond
manoeuvring
alice
out
of
the
way
of
people
whom
she
wished
to
avoid
and
she
still
found
the
girl
as
she
always
thought
her
as
egotist
whose
best
impulses
toward
others
had
a
final
aim
in
herself
she
thought
her
very
crude
in
her
ideas
cruder
than
she
had
seemed
at
campobello
where
she
had
perhaps
been
softened
by
her
affinition
with
the
gentler
and
kindlier
nature
of
dan
mavering
brinkley
was
never
tired
of
saying
that
he
had
made
the
most
fortunate
escape
in
the
world
and
though
brinkley
owned
he
was
tired
of
hearing
it
she
continued
to
say
it
with
a
great
variety
of
speculation
she
recognised
that
in
most
girls
of
alice
age
many
traits
are
in
solution
waiting
their
precipitation
into
character
by
the
chemical
contact
which
time
and
chances
must
bring
and
that
it
was
not
fair
to
judge
her
by
the
present
ferment
of
hereditary
tendencies
but
she
rejoiced
all
the
same
that
it
was
not
dan
mavering
character
which
was
to
give
fixity
to
hers
the
more
she
saw
of
the
girl
the
more
she
was
convinced
that
two
such
people
could
only
make
each
other
unhappy
from
day
to
day
almost
from
hour
to
hour
she
resolved
to
write
to
mavering
and
tell
him
not
to
come
she
was
sure
that
the
pasmers
wished
to
have
the
affair
on
again
and
part
of
her
fascination
with
a
girl
whom
she
neither
liked
nor
approved
was
her
belief
that
alice
health
had
broken
under
the
strain
of
her
regrets
and
her
despair
she
did
not
get
better
from
the
change
of
air
she
grew
more
listless
and
languid
and
more
dependent
upon
brinkley
chary
sympathy
the
older
woman
asked
herself
again
and
again
what
made
the
girl
cling
to
her
was
she
going
to
ask
her
finally
to
intercede
with
dan
or
was
it
really
a
despairing
atonement
to
him
the
most
disagreeable
sacrifice
she
could
offer
as
brinkley
had
stupidly
suggested
she
believed
that
alice
selfishness
and
morbid
sentiment
were
equal
to
either
brinkley
generally
took
the
girl
part
against
his
wife
and
in
a
heavy
jocose
way
tried
to
cheer
her
up
he
did
little
things
for
her
fetched
and
carried
chairs
and
cushions
and
rugs
and
gave
his
attentions
the
air
of
pleasantries
one
of
his
offices
was
to
get
the
ladies
letters
for
them
in
the
evening
and
one
night
he
came
in
beaming
with
a
letter
for
each
of
them
where
they
sat
together
in
the
parlour
he
distributed
them
into
their
laps
hello
i
made
a
mistake
he
said
putting
down
his
head
to
take
back
the
letter
he
had
dropped
in
miss
pasmer
lap
i
given
you
my
wife
the
girl
glanced
at
it
gave
a
moaning
kind
of
cry
and
fell
beak
in
her
chair
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
brinkley
possessed
herself
of
the
other
letter
and
though
past
the
age
when
ladies
wish
to
kill
their
husbands
for
their
stupidity
she
gave
brinkley
a
look
of
massacre
which
mystified
even
more
than
it
murdered
his
innocence
he
had
to
learn
later
from
his
wife
more
elicit
fury
what
the
women
had
all
known
instantly
he
showed
his
usefulness
in
gathering
alice
up
and
getting
her
to
her
mother
room
oh
brinkley
implored
pasmer
following
her
to
the
door
is
mavering
coming
here
i
do
know
i
ca
say
i
have
read
the
letter
oh
do
let
me
know
when
you
read
it
wo
you
i
do
know
what
we
shall
brinkley
read
the
letter
in
her
own
room
you
go
down
she
said
to
her
husband
with
unabated
ferocity
and
telegraph
dan
mavering
at
wormley
not
to
came
say
we
going
away
at
then
she
sent
pasmer
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
not
it
has
been
the
experience
of
every
one
to
have
some
alien
concern
come
into
his
life
and
torment
him
with
more
anxiety
than
any
affair
of
his
own
this
is
perhaps
a
hint
from
the
infinite
sympathy
which
feels
for
us
all
that
none
of
us
can
hope
to
free
himself
from
the
troubles
of
others
that
we
are
each
bound
to
each
by
ties
which
for
the
most
part
we
can
not
perceive
but
which
at
the
moment
their
stress
comes
we
can
not
break
brinkley
lay
awake
and
raged
impotently
against
her
complicity
with
the
unhappiness
of
that
distasteful
girl
and
her
more
than
distasteful
mother
in
her
revolt
against
it
she
renounced
the
interest
she
had
felt
in
that
silly
boy
and
his
ridiculous
love
business
so
really
unimportant
to
her
whatever
turn
it
took
she
asked
herself
what
it
mattered
to
her
whether
those
children
marred
their
lives
one
way
or
another
way
there
was
a
lurid
moment
before
she
slept
when
she
wished
brinkley
to
go
down
and
recall
her
telegram
but
he
refused
to
be
a
fool
at
so
much
inconvenience
to
himself
brinkley
came
to
breakfast
feeling
so
much
more
haggard
than
she
found
either
of
the
pasmers
looking
that
she
was
able
to
throw
off
her
lingering
remorse
for
having
told
mavering
not
to
come
she
had
the
advantage
also
of
doubt
as
to
her
precise
motive
in
having
done
so
she
had
either
done
so
because
she
had
judged
it
best
for
him
not
to
see
miss
pasmer
again
or
else
she
had
done
so
to
relieve
the
girl
from
the
pain
of
an
encounter
which
her
mother
evidently
dreaded
for
her
if
one
motive
seemed
at
moments
outrageously
meddling
and
presumptuous
the
other
was
so
nobly
good
and
kind
that
it
more
than
counterbalanced
it
in
brinkley
mind
who
knew
very
well
in
spite
of
her
doubt
that
she
had
acted
from
a
mixture
of
both
with
this
conviction
it
was
both
a
comfort
and
a
pang
to
find
by
the
register
of
the
hotel
which
she
furtively
consulted
that
dan
had
not
arrived
by
the
morning
boat
as
she
groundlessly
feared
and
hoped
he
might
have
done
in
any
case
however
and
at
the
end
of
all
the
ends
she
had
that
girl
on
her
hands
more
than
ever
and
believing
as
she
did
that
dan
and
alice
had
only
to
meet
in
order
to
be
reconciled
she
felt
that
the
girl
whom
she
had
balked
of
her
prey
was
her
innocent
victim
what
right
had
she
to
interfere
was
he
not
her
natural
prey
if
he
liked
being
a
prey
who
was
lawfully
to
forbid
him
he
was
not
perfect
he
would
know
how
to
take
care
of
himself
probably
in
marriage
things
equalised
themselves
she
looked
at
the
girl
thin
cheeks
and
eyes
and
pitied
and
hated
her
with
that
strange
mixture
of
feeling
which
our
victims
aspire
in
us
she
walked
out
on
the
verandah
with
the
pasmers
after
breakfast
and
chatted
a
while
about
indifferent
things
and
alice
made
an
effort
to
ignore
the
event
of
the
night
before
with
a
pathos
which
wrung
brinkley
heart
and
with
a
gay
resolution
which
ought
to
have
been
a
great
pleasure
to
such
a
veteran
dissembler
as
her
mother
she
said
she
had
never
found
the
air
so
delicious
she
really
believed
it
would
begin
to
do
her
good
now
but
it
was
a
little
fresh
just
there
and
with
her
eyes
she
invited
her
mother
to
come
with
her
round
the
corner
into
that
sheltered
recess
and
invited
brinkley
not
to
come
it
was
that
effect
of
resentment
which
is
lighter
even
than
a
touch
the
waft
of
the
arrow
feather
but
it
could
wound
a
guilty
heart
and
brinkley
sat
down
where
she
was
realising
with
a
pang
that
the
time
when
she
might
have
been
everything
to
this
unhappy
girl
had
just
passed
for
ever
and
henceforth
she
could
be
nothing
she
remained
musing
sadly
upon
the
contradictions
she
had
felt
in
the
girl
character
the
confusion
of
good
and
evil
the
potentialities
of
misery
and
harm
the
potentialities
of
bliss
and
good
and
she
felt
less
and
less
satisfied
with
herself
she
had
really
presumed
to
interfere
with
fate
perhaps
she
had
interfered
with
providence
she
would
have
given
anything
to
recall
her
act
and
then
with
a
flash
she
realised
that
it
was
quite
possible
to
recall
it
she
could
telegraph
mavering
to
come
and
she
rose
humbly
and
gratefully
as
if
from
an
answered
prayer
to
go
and
do
so
she
was
not
at
all
a
young
woman
and
many
things
had
come
and
gone
in
her
life
that
ought
to
have
fortified
her
against
surprise
but
she
wanted
to
scream
like
a
little
frightened
girl
as
dan
mavering
stepped
out
of
the
parlour
door
toward
her
the
habit
of
not
screaming
however
prevailed
and
she
made
a
tolerably
successful
effort
to
treat
him
with
decent
composure
she
gave
him
a
rigid
hand
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
did
you
get
my
telegram
no
did
you
get
my
letter
well
i
took
a
notion
to
come
right
on
after
i
wrote
and
i
started
on
the
same
train
with
it
but
they
said
it
was
no
use
trying
to
get
into
the
hygeia
and
i
stopped
last
night
at
the
little
hotel
in
hampton
i
just
walked
over
and
brinkley
told
me
you
were
out
here
somewhere
that
the
whole
story
i
he
gave
his
nervous
laugh
but
it
seemed
to
brinkley
that
it
had
not
much
joy
in
it
hush
she
said
involuntarily
receding
to
her
chair
and
sinking
back
into
it
again
he
looked
surprised
you
know
the
van
hooks
are
gone
he
laughed
harshly
i
should
think
they
were
dead
from
your
manner
brinkley
but
i
did
come
to
see
the
van
hooks
what
made
you
think
i
did
he
gave
her
a
look
which
she
found
so
dishonest
so
really
insincere
that
she
resolved
to
abandon
him
to
providence
as
soon
as
she
could
oh
i
did
know
but
there
had
been
some
little
understanding
at
perhaps
on
their
part
they
were
people
who
seemed
to
take
a
good
many
things
for
granted
but
they
could
hardly
expect
to
control
other
people
he
looked
sharply
at
brinkley
as
if
to
question
how
much
she
knew
but
she
had
now
measured
him
and
she
said
oh
then
the
visit
to
me
entirely
cried
dan
the
old
sweetness
came
into
his
laughing
eyes
again
and
went
to
brinkley
heart
she
wished
him
to
be
happy
somehow
she
would
have
done
anything
for
him
she
wished
she
knew
what
to
do
ought
she
to
tell
him
the
pasmers
were
there
ought
she
to
make
up
some
excuse
and
get
him
away
before
he
met
them
she
felt
herself
getting
more
and
more
bewildered
and
helpless
those
women
might
come
round
that
corner
any
moment
and
then
she
know
the
first
sight
of
alice
face
would
do
or
undo
everything
with
dan
did
she
wish
them
reconciled
did
she
wish
them
for
ever
parted
she
no
longer
knew
what
she
wished
she
only
knew
that
she
had
no
right
to
wish
anything
she
continued
to
talk
on
with
dan
who
grew
more
and
more
at
ease
and
did
most
of
the
talking
while
brinkley
whole
being
narrowed
itself
to
the
question
would
the
pasmers
come
back
that
way
or
would
they
go
round
the
further
corner
and
get
into
the
hotel
by
another
door
the
suspense
seemed
interminable
they
must
have
already
gone
that
other
way
suddenly
she
heard
the
pushing
back
of
chairs
in
that
recess
she
could
not
bear
it
she
jumped
to
her
feet
just
wait
a
moment
mavering
i
join
you
again
brinkley
is
expecting
i
must
one
morning
of
the
following
june
brinkley
sat
well
forward
in
the
beautiful
church
where
dan
and
alice
were
to
be
married
the
lovely
day
became
a
still
lovelier
day
within
enriched
by
the
dyes
of
the
stained
windows
through
which
it
streamed
the
still
place
was
dim
yet
bright
with
it
the
figures
painted
on
the
walls
had
a
soft
distinctness
a
body
of
light
seemed
to
irradiate
from
the
depths
of
the
dome
like
there
was
a
subdued
murmur
of
voices
among
the
people
in
the
pews
they
were
in
a
sacred
edifice
without
being
exactly
at
church
and
they
might
talk
now
and
then
a
muffled
nervous
laugh
escaped
a
delicate
scent
of
flowers
from
the
masses
in
the
chancel
mixed
with
the
light
and
the
prevailing
silence
there
was
a
soft
continuous
rustle
of
drapery
as
the
ladies
advanced
up
the
thickly
carpeted
aisles
on
the
arms
of
the
young
ushers
and
compressed
themselves
into
place
in
the
pews
two
or
three
people
whom
she
did
not
know
were
put
into
the
pew
with
brinkley
but
she
kept
her
seat
next
the
aisle
presently
an
usher
brought
up
a
lady
who
sat
down
beside
her
and
then
for
a
moment
or
two
seemed
to
sink
and
rise
as
if
on
the
springs
of
an
intense
excitement
it
was
miss
cotton
who
while
this
process
of
quiescing
lasted
appeared
not
to
know
brinkley
when
she
became
aware
of
her
all
was
lost
again
mrs
brinkley
she
cried
as
well
as
one
can
cry
in
whisper
is
it
possible
i
have
my
doubts
brinkley
whispered
back
but
we
suppose
the
oh
it
all
too
good
to
be
true
how
i
envy
you
being
the
means
of
bringing
them
together
brinkley
means
yes
they
owe
it
all
to
you
you
need
try
to
deny
it
he
told
every
one
i
was
sure
she
had
said
brinkley
remembering
how
alice
had
marked
an
increasing
ignorance
of
any
part
she
might
have
had
in
the
affair
from
the
first
moment
of
her
reconciliation
with
dan
she
had
the
effect
of
feeling
that
she
had
sacrificed
enough
to
brinkley
and
brinkley
had
been
restored
to
all
the
original
strength
of
her
conviction
that
she
was
a
solemn
little
unconscious
egotist
and
dan
was
as
unselfish
and
good
as
he
was
unequal
to
her
exactions
oh
no
said
miss
cotton
she
could
implying
that
alice
would
be
too
delicate
to
speak
of
it
do
you
see
any
of
his
family
here
asked
brinkley
yes
over
there
up
miss
cotton
motioned
with
her
eyes
toward
a
pew
in
which
brinkley
distinguished
an
elderly
bald
head
and
the
back
of
a
young
lady
bonnet
his
father
and
sister
the
other
a
bridemaid
mother
and
they
might
have
brought
her
in
suggested
brinkley
ironically
on
such
an
occasion
but
perhaps
they
do
take
much
interest
in
such
a
oh
yes
they
do
exclaimed
miss
cotton
they
idolise
and
pasmer
and
mister
too
i
do
suppose
that
so
much
they
know
how
to
acquiesce
i
no
oh
yes
you
heard
the
young
people
are
going
abroad
first
with
her
family
for
a
year
and
then
they
come
back
to
live
with
his
where
the
works
poor
fellow
said
brinkley
why
brinkley
do
you
still
feel
that
way
asked
miss
cotton
with
a
certain
distress
it
seems
to
me
that
if
ever
two
young
people
had
the
promise
of
happiness
they
have
just
see
what
their
love
has
done
for
them
already
and
you
still
think
that
in
these
cases
love
can
do
everything
miss
cotton
was
about
to
reply
when
she
observed
that
the
people
about
her
had
stopped
talking
the
bridegroom
with
his
best
man
in
whom
his
few
acquaintances
there
recognised
boardman
with
some
surprise
came
over
the
chancel
from
one
side
miss
cotton
bent
close
to
brinkley
and
whispered
rapidly
alice
found
out
mavering
wished
it
and
insisted
on
his
having
him
it
was
a
great
concession
but
she
perfectly
magnanimous
poor
fellow
how
he
does
look
alice
on
her
father
arm
with
her
bridemaids
of
whom
the
first
was
minnie
mavering
mounted
the
chancel
steps
where
pasmer
remained
standing
till
he
advanced
to
give
away
the
bride
he
behaved
with
great
dignity
but
seemed
deeply
affected
the
ladies
in
the
front
pews
said
they
could
see
his
face
twitch
but
he
never
looked
handsomer
the
five
clergymen
came
from
the
back
of
the
chancel
in
their
white
surplices
the
ceremony
proceeded
to
the
end
the
young
couple
drove
at
once
to
the
station
where
they
were
to
take
the
train
for
new
york
and
wait
there
a
day
or
two
for
and
pasmer
before
they
all
sailed
as
they
drove
along
alice
held
dan
wrist
in
the
cold
clutch
of
her
trembling
little
ungloved
hand
on
which
her
wedding
ring
shone
o
dearest
let
us
be
good
she
said
i
will
try
my
best
i
will
try
not
to
be
exacting
and
unreasonable
and
i
know
i
can
i
wo
even
make
any
conditions
if
you
will
always
be
frank
and
open
with
me
and
tell
me
he
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
behind
the
drawn
curtains
i
will
alice
i
will
indeed
i
wo
keep
anything
from
you
after
he
resolved
to
tell
her
all
about
julia
anderson
at
the
right
moment
when
alice
was
in
the
mood
and
as
soon
as
he
thoroughly
understood
what
he
had
really
meant
himself
if
he
had
been
different
she
would
not
have
asked
him
to
be
frank
and
open
if
she
had
been
different
he
might
have
been
frank
and
open
this
was
the
beginning
of
their
married
life
