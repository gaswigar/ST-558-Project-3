many
years
both
in

other

ruskin
as
would
be

known
to

of

held
perhaps
the

that
passage
no
doubt
had
been
read
by
thousands
and
so
it
had
gone
forth
to
the
world
that
whistler
was
an
man
an
impostor
a
cockney
pretender
and
an
impudent
coxcomb
whistler
by
the
said
i
have
sent
pictures
to
the
academy
which
have
not
been
received
i
believe
that
is
the
experience
of
all
artists
the
nocturne
in
black
and
gold
is
a
night
piece
and
represents
the
fireworks
at
cremorne
not
a
view
of
cremorne
if
it
were
called
a
view
of
cremorne
it
would
certainly
bring
about
nothing
but
disappointment
on
the
part
of
the
beholders
it
is
an
artistic
arrangement
it
was
marked
two
hundred
guineas
is
not
that
what
we
who
are
not
artists
would
call
a
stiffish
price
i
think
it
very
likely
that
that
may
be
so
but
artists
always
give
good
value
for
their
money
do
they
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
so
well
established
i
do
not
know
ruskin
or
that
he
holds
the
view
that
a
picture
should
only
be
exhibited
when
it
is
finished
when
nothing
can
be
done
to
improve
it
but
that
is
a
correct
view
the
arrangement
in
black
and
gold
was
a
finished
picture
i
did
not
intend
to
do
anything
more
to
it
now
whistler
can
you
tell
me
how
long
it
took
you
to
knock
off
that
nocturne
i
beg
your
pardon
oh
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
using
a
term
that
applies
rather
perhaps
to
my
own
work
i
should
have
said
how
long
did
you
take
to
paint
that
picture
oh
no
permit
me
i
am
too
greatly
flattered
to
think
that
you
apply
to
work
of
mine
any
term
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
using
with
reference
to
your
own
let
us
say
then
how
long
did
i
take
to
off
i
think
that
is
it
to
knock
off
that
nocturne
well
as
well
as
i
remember
about
a
day
only
a
day
well
i
wo
be
quite
positive
i
may
have
still
put
a
few
more
touches
to
it
the
next
day
if
the
painting
were
not
dry
i
had
better
say
then
that
i
was
two
days
at
work
on
it
oh
two
days
the
labour
of
two
days
then
is
that
for
which
you
ask
two
hundred
guineas
no
i
ask
it
for
the
knowledge
of
a
lifetime
you
have
been
told
that
your
pictures
exhibit
some
eccentricities
yes
often
you
send
them
to
the
galleries
to
incite
the
admiration
of
the
public
that
would
be
such
vast
absurdity
on
my
part
that
i
do
think
i
could
you
know
that
many
critics
entirely
disagree
with
your
views
as
to
these
pictures
it
would
be
beyond
me
to
agree
with
the
critics
you
do
approve
of
criticism
then
i
should
not
disapprove
in
any
way
of
technical
criticism
by
a
man
whose
whole
life
is
passed
in
the
practice
of
the
science
which
he
criticises
but
for
the
opinion
of
a
man
whose
life
is
not
so
passed
i
would
have
as
little
regard
as
you
would
if
he
expressed
an
opinion
on
law
you
expect
to
be
criticised
yes
certainly
and
i
do
not
expect
to
be
affected
by
it
until
it
becomes
a
case
of
this
kind
it
is
not
only
when
criticism
is
inimical
that
i
object
to
it
but
also
when
it
is
incompetent
i
hold
that
none
but
an
artist
can
be
a
competent
critic
you
put
your
pictures
upon
the
garden
wall
whistler
or
hang
them
on
the
clothes
line
do
you
to
mellow
i
do
not
understand
do
you
not
put
your
paintings
out
into
the
garden
oh
i
understand
now
i
thought
at
first
that
you
were
perhaps
again
using
a
term
that
you
are
accustomed
to
yourself
yes
i
certainly
do
put
the
canvases
into
the
garden
that
they
may
dry
in
the
open
air
while
i
am
painting
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
them
why
do
you
call
irving
arrangement
in
black
baron
huddleston
it
is
the
picture
and
not
irving
that
is
the
arrangement
a
discussion
ensued
as
to
the
inspection
of
the
pictures
and
incidentally
baron
huddleston
remarked
that
a
critic
must
be
competent
to
form
an
opinion
and
bold
enough
to
express
that
opinion
in
strong
terms
if
necessary
the
complained
that
no
answer
was
given
to
a
written
application
by
the
defendant
solicitors
for
leave
to
inspect
the
pictures
which
the
plaintiff
had
been
called
upon
to
produce
at
the
trial
the
witness
replied
that
arthur
severn
had
been
to
his
studio
to
inspect
the
paintings
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
for
the
purpose
of
passing
his
final
judgment
upon
them
and
settling
that
question
for
ever
continued
what
was
the
subject
of
the
nocturne
in
blue
and
silver
belonging
to
mr
grahame
a
moonlight
effect
on
the
river
near
old
battersea
bridge
what
has
become
of
the
nocturne
in
black
and
gold
i
believe
it
is
before
you
the
picture
called
the
nocturne
in
blue
and
silver
was
now
produced
in
court
that
is
grahame
picture
it
represents
battersea
bridge
by
moonlight
baron
huddleston
which
part
of
the
picture
is
the
bridge
his
lordship
earnestly
rebuked
those
who
laughed
and
witness
explained
to
his
lordship
the
composition
of
the
picture
do
you
say
that
this
is
a
correct
representation
of
battersea
bridge
i
did
not
intend
it
to
be
a
portrait
of
the
bridge
it
is
only
a
moonlight
scene
and
the
pier
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
may
not
be
like
the
piers
at
battersea
bridge
as
you
know
them
in
broad
daylight
as
to
what
the
picture
represents
that
depends
upon
who
looks
at
it
to
some
persons
it
may
represent
all
that
is
intended
to
others
it
may
represent
nothing
the
prevailing
colour
is
blue
perhaps
are
those
figures
on
the
top
of
the
bridge
intended
for
people
they
are
just
what
you
like
is
that
a
barge
beneath
yes
i
am
very
much
encouraged
at
your
perceiving
that
my
whole
scheme
was
only
to
bring
about
a
certain
harmony
of
colour
what
is
that
mark
on
the
right
of
the
picture
like
a
cascade
the
of
gold
is
a
firework
a
second
nocturne
in
blue
and
silver
was
then
produced
witness
that
represents
another
moonlight
scene
on
the
thames
looking
up
battersea
reach
i
completed
the
mass
of
the
picture
in
one
day
the
court
then
adjourned
during
the
interval
the
jury
visited
the
probate
court
to
view
the
pictures
which
had
been
collected
in
the
westminster
palace
hotel
after
the
court
had
the
nocturne
in
black
and
gold
was
again
produced
and
whistler
was
further
by
the
the
picture
represents
a
distant
view
of
cremorne
with
a
falling
rocket
and
other
fireworks
it
occupied
two
days
and
is
a
finished
picture
the
black
monogram
on
the
frame
was
placed
in
its
position
with
reference
to
the
proper
decorative
balance
of
the
whole
you
have
made
the
study
of
art
your
study
of
a
lifetime
now
do
you
think
that
anybody
looking
at
that
picture
might
fairly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
no
peculiar
beauty
i
have
strong
evidence
that
ruskin
did
come
to
that
conclusion
do
you
think
it
fair
that
ruskin
should
come
to
that
conclusion
what
might
be
fair
to
ruskin
i
can
not
answer
then
you
mean
whistler
that
the
initiated
in
technical
matters
might
have
no
difficulty
in
understanding
your
work
but
do
you
think
now
that
you
could
make
see
the
beauty
of
that
picture
the
witness
then
paused
and
examining
attentively
the
face
and
looking
at
the
picture
alternately
said
after
apparently
giving
the
subject
much
thought
while
the
court
waited
in
silence
for
his
answer
no
do
you
know
i
fear
it
would
be
as
hopeless
as
for
the
musician
to
pour
his
notes
into
the
ear
of
a
deaf
man
i
offer
the
picture
which
i
have
conscientiously
painted
as
being
worth
two
hundred
guineas
i
have
known
unbiassed
people
express
the
opinion
that
it
represents
fireworks
in
a
i
would
not
complain
of
any
person
who
might
simply
take
a
different
view
the
court
then
adjourned
the
in
resuming
his
address
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
on
tuesday
said
he
hoped
to
convince
the
jury
before
his
case
closed
that
ruskin
criticism
upon
the
plaintiff
pictures
was
perfectly
fair
and

that
however
severe
it
might

was

that
could

them
examine
the

in
blue

said
to
represent
battersea

what
was
that
structure
in
the
middle
was
it
a
telescope
or
a
was
it
like
battersea
bridge
what
were
the
figures
at
the
top
of
the
bridge
and
if
they
were
horses
and
carts
how
in
the
name
of
fortune
were
they
to
get
off
now
about
these
pictures
if
the
plaintiff
argument
was
to
avail
they
must
not
venture
publicly
to
express
an
opinion
or
they
would
have
brought
against
them
an
action
for
damages
note
enter
now
the
great
room
with
the
veronese
at
the
end
of
it
for
which
the
painter
was
summoned
before
the
inquisition
of
prof
john
ruskin
to
principal
pictures
academy
of
fine
arts
after
all
critics
had
their
uses
he
should
like
to
know
what
would
become
of
poetry
of
politics
of
painting
if
critics
were
to
be
extinguished
every
painter
struggled
to
obtain
fame
note
i
have
now
given
up
ten
years
of
my
life
to
the
single
purpose
of
enabling
myself
to
judge
rightly
of
art
earnestly
desiring
to
ascertain
and
be
able
to
the
truth
respecting
art
also
knowing
that
this
truth
was
time
and
definitely
prof
ruskin
vol
iii
thirdly
that
truths
of
colour
are
the
least
important
of
all
mr
ruskin
prof
of
art
vol
chap
and
that
colour
is
indeed
a
most
unimportant
characteristic
of
objects
would
be
further
evident
on
the
slightest
consideration
the
colour
of
plants
is
constantly
changing
with
the
season
but
the
nature
and
essence
of
the
thing
are
independent
of
these
changes
an
oak
is
an
oak
whether
green
with
spring
or
red
with
winter
a
dahlia
is
a
dahlia
whether
it
be
yellow
or
crimson
and
if
some
monster
hunting
florist
should
ever
frighten
the
flower
blue
still
it
will
be
a
dahlia
but
not
so
if
the
same
arbitrary
changes
could
be
effected
in
its
form
let
the
roughness
of
the
bark
and
the
angles
of
the
boughs
be
smoothed
or
diminished
and
the
oak
ceases
to
be
an
oak
but
let
it
retain
its
universal
structure
and
outward
form
and
though
its
leaves
grow
white
or
pink
or
blue
or
it
would
be
a
white
oak
or
a
pink
oak
or
a
republican
oak
but
an
oak

he
is
a
little

bad
mr

art
critic
i
repeat
there
is
nothing
but
the
work
of
prout
which
is
true
living
or
right
in
its
general
impression
and
nothing
therefore
so
inexhaustively
sic
j
ruskin
art
professor
as
to
these
pictures
they
could
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
strange
fantastical
conceits
not
worthy
to
be
called
works
of
art
coming
to
the
libel
the
said
it
had
been
contended
that
ruskin
was
not
justified
in
interfering
with
a
man
livelihood
but
why
not
then
it
was
said
oh
you
have
ridiculed
whistler
pictures
if
whistler
disliked
ridicule
he
should
not
have
subjected
himself
to
it
by
exhibiting
publicly
such
productions
if
a
man
thought
a
picture
was
a
daub
he
had
a
right
to
say
so
without
subjecting
himself
to
a
risk
of
an
action
note
now
it
is
evident
that
in
system
while
the
contrasts
are
not
more
right
than
with
veronese
the
colours
are
all
wrong

beginning
to

authority
sidenote
in
conduct
and
in
conversation
it
did
a
sinner
good
to
hear
him
deal
in
ratiocination
illustration
he
would
not
be
able
to
call
ruskin
as
he
was
far
too
ill
to
attend
but
if
he
had
been
able
to
appear
he
would
have
given
his
opinion
of
whistler
work
in
the
he
had
the
highest
appreciation
for
and
he
required
from
an
artist
that
he
should
possess
something
more
than
a
few
flashes
of
genius

have
just

be

neither

illustration
ruskin
entertaining
those
views
it
was
not
wonderful
that
his
attention
should
be
attracted
to
whistler
pictures
he
subjected
the
pictures
if
they
chose
to
ridicule
and
contempt
then
ruskin
spoke
of
the
conceit
of
the
artist
so
nearly
approaching
the
action
of
imposture
if
his
pictures
were
mere
extravagances
how
could
it
redound
to
the
credit
of
whistler
to
send
them
to
the
grosvenor
gallery
to
be
exhibited
some
artistic
gentleman
from
manchester
leeds
or
sheffield
might
perhaps
be
induced
to
buy
one
of
the
pictures
because
it
was
a
whistler
and
what
ruskin
meant
was
that
he
might
better
have
remained
in
manchester
sheffield
or
leeds
with
his
money
in
his
pocket
it
was
said
that
the
term
conceit
ought
never
to
have
been
applied
to
whistler
who
had
devoted
the
whole
of
his
life
to
educating
himself
in
art
but
ruskin
views
as
to
his
success
did
not
accord
with
those
of
whistler
the
libel
complained
of
said
also
i
never
expected
to
hear
a
coxcomb
ask
two
hundred
guineas
for
flinging
a
pot
of
paint
in
the
public
face
what
was
a
coxcomb
he
had
looked
the
word
up
and
found
that
it
came
from
the
old
idea
of
the
licensed
jester
who
wore
a
cap
and
bells
with
a
cock
comb
in
it
who
went
about
making
jests
for
the
amusement
of
his
master
and
family
if
that
were
the
true
definition
then
whistler
should
not
complain
because
his
pictures
had
afforded
a
most
amusing
jest
did
not
know
when
so
much
amusement
had
been
afforded
to
the
british
public
as
by
whistler
he
had
now
finished
ruskin
had
lived
a
long
life
without
being
attacked
and
no
one
had
attempted
to
control
his
pen
through
the
medium
of
a
jury
ruskin
said
through
him
as
his
counsel
that
he
did
not
retract
one
syllable
of
his
criticism
believing
it
was
right
of
course
if
they
found
a
verdict
against
ruskin
he
would
have
to
cease
writing
but
it
would
be
an
evil
day
for
art
in
this
country
when
ruskin
would
be
prevented
from
indulging
in
legitimate
and
proper
criticism
by
pointing
out
what
was
beautiful
and
what
was
not
note
vulgarity
dulness
or
impiety
will
indeed
always
express
themselves
through
art
in
brown
and
gray
as
in
prof
john
ruskin
note
it
is
physically
impossible
for
instance
rightly
to
draw
certain
forms
of
the
upper
clouds
with
a
brush
nothing
will
do
it
but
the
palette
knife
with
loaded
white
after

prepared

and
thus
we
are
guided
almost
forced
by
the
laws
of
nature
to
do
right
in
art
had
granite
been
white
and
marble
speckled
and
why
should
this
not
have
been
but
by
the
definite
divine
appointment
for
the
good
of
man
the
huge
figures
of
the
egyptian
would
have
been
as
oppressive
to
the
sight
as

looked

graceful

the
exquisite
choice
of
this
incident
is
quite
as
appreciable
when
it
is
told
as
when
it
is

it
has
nothing
to

exclusively
and
even
for

accurately

gave

in

to

said
i
am
a

have
devoted
about
twenty
years
to
the
study
i
have
painted
various
works

the
of

both
of
which
were

in

have
also
exhibited

i
have
one
work

vivian
now
being
exhibited
in
paris
in
my
opinion
complete
finish
ought
to
be
the
object
of
all
artists
a
picture
ought
not
to
fall
short
of
what
has
been

ah
well
do
you
consider

essential
to

most
certainly
i
do

then
what
detail

do
you
find
in

there
is
a
cunning

does
it
show
the

the

that

the

all
confusion
retained
with
the
paternal
and
everlasting
art
of

john
ruskin
july
not
in
any
sense
whatever
the
picture
representing
a
night
scene
on
battersea
bridge
is
good
in
colour
but
bewildering
in
form
and
it
has
no
composition
and
detail
a
day
or
a
day
and
a
half
seems
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
paint
it
it
shows
no
finish
it
is
simply
a
sketch
the
nocturne
in
black
and
gold
has
not
the
merit
of
the
other
two
pictures
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
call
it
a
serious
work
of
art
whistler
picture
is
only
one
of
the
thousand
failures
to
paint
night
the
picture
is
not
worth
two
hundred
guineas
bowen
here
proposed
to
ask
the
witness
to
look
at
a
picture
of

in
order
to
show
what
finish
was

i
believe
the
world
may
see
another
titian

another

before
it
sees
another
mr
ruskin
note
the
butcher
dog
in
the
corner
of

displays
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
because
the
most
dignified
finish
and
assuredly
the
most
perfect
unity
of
drawing
and
colour
which
the
entire
range
of
ancient
and
modern
art
can
exhibit
albert

is
indeed
the
only
rival
who
might
be
suggested

baron

you
will
have
to
prove
that
it
is

i
shall
be
able
to
do
that
baron
huddleston
that
can
only
be
by
repute
i
do
not
want
to
raise
a
laugh
but
there
is
a
case
of
titian
being
purchased
with
a
view
to
enabling
students
and
others
to
find
out
how
to
produce
his
wonderful
colours
with
that
object
the
picture
was
rubbed
down
and
they
found
a
red
surface
beneath
which
they
thought
was
the
secret
but
on
continuing
the
rubbing
they
discovered
a
full
length
portrait
of
george
iii
in
uniform
the
witness
was
then
asked
to
look
at
the
picture
and
he
said
it
is
a
portrait
of
doge
andrea
gritti
and
i
believe
it
is
a
real
titian
it
shows
finish
it
is
a
very
perfect
sample
of
the
highest
finish
of
ancient
art
the
flesh
is
perfect
the
modelling
of
the
face
is
round
and
good
that
is
an
in
flesh
and
blood
note
i
feel
entitled
to
point
out
that
the
picture
by
titian
produced
in
the
case
of
whistler
ruskin
is
an
early
specimen
of
that
master
and
does
not
represent
adequately
the
style
and
qualities
which
have
obtained
for
him
his
great
reputation
one
obvious
point
of
difference
between
this
and
his
more
mature
work
being
the
far
greater
amount
of
finish
i
do
not
say
completeness
exhibited
in
it
and
as
the
picture
was
brought
forward
with
a
view
to
inform
the
jury
as
to
the
nature
of
the
work
of
the
greatest
painter
and
more
especially
as
to
the
high
finish
introduced
in
it
it
is
evident
that
it
was
calculated
to
produce
an
erroneous
impression
on
their
minds
if
indeed
any
one
present
at
the
inquiry
can
hold
that
those
gentlemen
were
in
any
way
fitted
to
understand
the
issues
raised

of
a
letter
to
the

of
the
the
witness
having
pointed
out
the
excellences
of
that
portrait
said
i
think
whistler
had
great
powers
at
first
which
he
has
not
since
justified
he
has
evaded
the
difficulties
of
his
art
because
the
difficulty
of
an
artist
increases
every
day
of
his
professional
life
what
is
the
value
of
this
picture
of
titian
that
is
a
mere
accident
of
the
saleroom
is
it
worth
one
thousand

it
would
be
worth

it

a
toss
up

i

i
have
seen
whistler
pictures
and
in
my
opinion
they
are
not
serious
works
of

the
nocturne
in
black

is
not
a
serious
work
to
me
i
can
not
see
anything
of
the
true
representation
of
water
and
atmosphere
in
the
painting
of
bridge
there
is
a
pretty
colour
which
pleases
the
eye
but
there
is
nothing
more
to
my
thinking
the
description
of
moonlight
is
not
true
the
picture
is
not
worth
two
hundred
guineas
composition
and
detail
are
most
important
matters
in
a
picture
in
our
profession
men
of
equal
merit
differ
as
to
the
character
of
a
picture
one
may
blame
while
another
praises
a
work
i
have
not
exhibited
at
the
grosvenor
gallery
i
have
read
ruskin
works
sidenote
a
decidedly
honest
man
i
have
not
heard
of
him
since
illustration
frith
here
got
down
tom
taylor
poor
law
commissioner
editor
of
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
i
am
an
art
critic
of
long
standing
i
have
been
engaged
in
this
capacity
by
the
and
other
journals
for
the
last
twenty
years
i
edited
the
of
reynolds
and
i
have
studied
art
i
have
seen
these
pictures
of
whistler
when
they
were
exhibited
at
the
dudley
and
the
grosvenor
galleries
the
in
black
and
gold
i
do
not
think
a
serious
work
of
art
the
witness
here
took
from
the
pockets
of
his
overcoat
copies
of
the
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court
read
again
with
unction
his
own
criticism
to
every
word
of
which
he
said
he
still
adhered
all
whistler
work
is
unfinished
it
is
sketchy
he
no
doubt
possesses
artistic
qualities
and
he
has
got
appreciation
of
qualities
of
tone
but
he
is
not
complete
and
all
his
works
are
in
the
nature
of
sketching
i
have
expressed
and
still
adhere
to
the
opinion
that
these
pictures
only
come
step
nearer
pictures
than
a
delicately
tinted
sidenote
to
perceive
in
ruskin
army
tom
taylor
his
champion
whose
opinion
he
prizes
frith
his
ideal
was
gratifying
but
to
sit
and
look
at
burne
jones
in
common
cause
with
tom
taylor
whom
he
esteems
and
frith
whom
he
respects
conscientiously
appraising
the
work
of

was
a
privilege

why
should
not

whatever

tom

may
still

not

urge
you
to

you

curious
combinations
ever

illustration

ruskin

and

the
and
spirit
of
this
matter
seems
to
have
been
utterly
missed
or
perhaps
willingly
winked
at
by
the
journals
in
their
comments
their
correspondents
have
persistently
and
not
unnaturally
as
writers
seen
nothing
beyond
the
immediate
case
in
law
the
difference
between
ruskin
and
myself
culminating
in
the
libel
with
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
now
the
war
of
which
the
opening
skirmish
was
fought
the
other
day
in
westminster
is
really
one
between
the
brush
and
the
pen
and
involves
literally
as
the
himself
hinted
the
absolute
raison
of
the
critic
the
cry
on
their
part
of
il
faut
vivre
i
most
certainly
meet
in
this
case
with
the
appropriate
answer
je
vois
pas
la
nécessité
far
from
me
at
that
stage
of
things
to
go
further
into
this
discussion
than
i
did
when
by
sir
john
holker
i
contented
myself
with
the
general
answer
that
one
might
admit
criticism
when
emanating
from
a
man
who
had
passed
his
whole
life
in
the
science
which
he
attacks
the
position
of
ruskin
as
an
art
authority
we
left
quite
unassailed
during
the
trial
to
have
said
that
ruskin
pose
among
intelligent
men
as
other
than
a
is
false
and
ridiculous
would
have
been
an
invitation
to
the
stake
and
to
be
burnt
alive
or
stoned
before
the
verdict
was
not
what
i
came
into
court
for
over
and
over
again
did
the
cry
out
aloud
in
the
agony
of
his
cause
what
is
to
become
of
painting
if
the
critics
withhold
their
lash
as
well
might
he
ask
what
is
to
become
of
mathematics
under
similar
circumstances
were
they
possible
i
maintain
that
two
and
two
the
mathematician
would
continue
to
make
four
in
spite
of
the
whine
of
the
amateur
for
three
or
the
cry
of
the
critic
for
five
we
are
told
that
ruskin
has
devoted
his
long
life
to
art
and
as
a
result
is
slade
professor
at
oxford
in
the
same
sentence
we
have
thus
his
position
and
its
worth
it
suffices
not
messieurs
a
life
passed
among
pictures
makes
not
a
painter
else
the
policeman
in
the
national
gallery
might
assert
himself
as
well
allege
that
he
who
lives
in
a
library
must
needs
die
a
poet
let
not
ruskin
flatter
himself
that
more
education
makes
the
difference
between
himself
and
the
policeman
when
both
stand
gazing
in
the
gallery
there
they
might
remain
till
the
end
of
time
the
one
decently
silent
the
other
saying
in
good
english
many
empty
things
like
the
cracking
of
thorns
under
a
pot
undismayed
by
the
presence
of
the
masters
with
whose
names
he
is
sacrilegiously
familiar
whose
intentions
he
interprets
whose
vices
he
discovers
with
the
facility
of
the
incapable
and
whose
virtues
he
descants
upon
with
a
verbosity
and
flow
of
language
that
would
could
he
hear
it
give
titian
the
same
shock
of
surprise
that
was
balaam
when
the
first
great
critic
proffered
his
opinion
this
one
instance
apart
where
collapse
was
immediate
the
creature
critic
is
of
comparatively
modern
growth
and
certainly
in
perfect
condition
of
recent
date
to
his
completeness
go
qualities
evolved
from
the
latest
lightnesses
of
indeed
the
of
his
type
is
brought
forth
in
paris
and
beside
him
the
englishman
is
but
and
blundering
after
all
though
not
unkindly
should
one
say
it
as
reproaching
him
with
inferiority
resulting
from
chances
neglected
the
truth
is
as
compared
with
his
brother
of
the
boulevards
the
briton
was
badly
begun
by
nature
to
take
himself
seriously
is
the
fate
of
the
humbug
at
home
and
destruction
to
the
jaunty
career
of
the
art
critic
whose
essence
of
success
lies
in
his
strong
sense
of
his
ephemeral
existence
and
his
consequent
horror
of
his
world
in
short
to
perceive
the
joke
of
life
is
rarely
given
to
our
people
whilst
it
forms
the
mainspring
of
the
parisian
the
finesse
of
the
frenchman
acquired
in
long
loafing
and
clever
cackle
the
glib
go
and
easy
assurance
of
the
combined
with
the
of
great
habit
the
brilliant
of
the
ateliers
the
aptitude
of
their
the
fling
of
the
and
the
knack
of
short
paragraphs
which
allows
him
to
print
of
a
picture
bien
écrit
and
of
a
subject
bien
dit
these
are
elements
of
an
impossible
in
this
island
still
we
are
various
in
our
specimens
and
a
sense
of
progress
is
noticeable
when
we
look
about
among
them
indications
of
their
period
are
perceptible
and
curiously
enough
a
similarity
is
suggested
by
their
work
between
themselves
and
the
vehicles
we
might
fancy
carrying
them
about
to
their
livelihood
tough
old
tom
the
busy
city
with
its
heavy
jolting
and
many
halts
its
steady
sturdy
stodgy
continuance
on
the
same
old
much
worn
way
every
turning
known
and
freshness
unhoped
for
its
patient
dreary
dulness
of
daily
duty
to
its
cheap
company
struggling
on
to
its
end
nevertheless
and
pulling
up
at
the
bank
with
a
flourish
from
the
driver
and
a
joke
from
the
cad
at
the
door
then
the
contributors
to
the
daily
papers
so
many
hansoms
bowling
along
that
the
moment
may
not
be
lost
and
the
gone
for
ever
the
one
or
two
broughams
solemnly
rolling
for
reviews
while
the
lighter
bicycle
zigzags
irresponsibly
in
among
them
for
the
happy
halfpennies
what
a
commerce
it
all
is
to
be
sure
no
sham
in
it
either
no
bigod
nonsense
they
are
all
doing
good
yes
they
all
do
good
to
art
poor
art
what
a
sad
state
the
slut
is
in
an
these
gentlemen
shall
help
her
the
artist
alone
by
the
way
is
to
no
purpose
and
remains
unconsulted
his
work
is
explained
and
rectified
without
him
by
the
one
who
was
never
in
it
but
upon
whom
god
always
good
though
sometimes
careless
has
thrown
away
the
knowledge
refused
to
the
author
poor
devil
the
said
there
are
some
people
who
would
do
away
with
critics
altogether
i
agree
with
him
and
am
of
the
irrationals
he
points
at
but
let
me
be
clearly
understood
the
critic
alone
would
i
extinguish
that
writers
should
destroy
writings
to
the
benefit
of
writing
is
reasonable
who
but
they
shall
insist
upon
beauties
of
literature
and
discard
the
demerits
of
their
brother
in
their
turn
they
will
be
destroyed
by
other
writers
and
the
merry
game
goes
on
till
truth
prevail
shall
the
painter
then
i
foresee
the
question
decide
upon
painting
shall
be
the
critic
and
sole
authority
aggressive
as
is
this
supposition
i
fear
that
in
the
length
of
time
his
assertion
alone
has
established
what
even
the
gentlemen
of
the
quill
accept
as
the
canons
of
art
and
recognise
as
the
masterpieces
of
work
let
work
then
be
received
in
silence
as
it
was
in
the
days
to
which
the
penmen
still
point
as
an
era
when
art
was
at
its
apogee
and
here
we
come
upon
the
apology
of
the
critic
for
existing
at
all
and
find
how
complete
is
his
stultification
he
brands
himself
as
the
necessary
blister
for
the
health
of
the
painter
and
writes
that
he
may
do
good
to
his
art
in
the
same
ink
he
bemoans
the
decadence
about
him
and
declares
that
the
best
work
was
done
when
he
was
not
there
to
help
it
no
let
there
be
no
critics
they
are
not
a
necessary
evil
but
an
evil
quite
unnecessary
though
an
evil
certainly
harm
they
do
and
not
good
furnished
as
they
are
with
the
means
of
furthering
their
foolishness
they
spread
prejudice
abroad
and
through
the
papers
at
their
service
thousands
are
warned
against
the
work
they
have
yet
to
look
upon
and
here
one
is
tempted
to
go
further
and
show
the
crass
idiocy
and
impertinence
of
those
whose
dicta
are
printed
as
law
how
he
of
the
has
found
velasquez
slovenly
in
execution
poor
in
colour
being
little
but
a
combination
of
neutral
greys
and
ugly
in
its
forms
how
he
grovelled
in
happiness
over
a
turner
that
was
no
turner
at
all
as
ruskin
wrote
to
show
ruskin
whom
he
has
since
defended
ah
messieurs
what
our
neighbours
call
la
malice
des
choses
was
unthought
of
and
the
sarcasm
of
fate
was
against
you
how
gerard
dow
broom
was
an
example
for
the
young
and
canaletti
and
paul
veronese
are
to
be
swept
aside
doubtless
with
it
how
rembrandt
is
coarse
and
carlo
dolci
noble
with
more
of
this
kind
but
what
does
it
matter
note
june
what
does
anything
matter
the
farce
will
go
on
and
its
solemnity
adds
to
the
fun
mediocrity
flattered
at
acknowledging
mediocrity
and
mistaking
mystification
for
mastery
enters
the
fog
of
dilettantism
and
graduating
connoisseur
ends
its
days
in
a
bewilderment
of
and
brummagem
taste
has
long
been
confounded
with
capacity
and
accepted
as
sufficient
qualification
for
the
utterance
of
judgment
in
music
poetry
and
painting
art
is
joyously
received
as
a
matter
of
opinion
and
that
it
should
be
based
upon
laws
as
rigid
and
defined
as
those
of
the
known
sciences
is
a
supposition
no
longer
to
be
tolerated
by
modern
cultivation
for
whereas
no
polished
member
of
society
is
at
all
affected
at
admitting
himself
neither
engineer
mathematician
nor
astronomer
and
therefore
remains
willingly
discreet
and
taciturn
upon
these
subjects
still
would
he
be
highly
offended
were
he
supposed
to
have
no
voice
in
what
is
clearly
to
him
a
matter
of
taste
and
so
he
becomes
of
necessity
the
backer
of
the
critic
the
cause
and
result
of
his
own
ignorance
and
vanity
the
fascination
of
this
pose
is
too
much
for
him
and
he
hails
with
delight
its
justification
modesty
and
good
sense
are
revolted
at
nothing
and
the
millennium
of
taste
sets
in
the
whole
scheme
is
simple
the
galleries
are
to
be
thrown
open
on
sundays
and
the
public
dragged
from
their
beer
to
the
british
museum
are
to
delight
in
the
elgin
marbles
and
appreciate
what
the
early
italians
have
done
to
elevate
their
thirsty
souls
an
inroad
into
the
laboratory
would
be
looked
upon
as
an
intrusion
but
before
the
triumphs
of
art
the
expounder
is
at
his
ease
and
points
out
the
doctrine
that
raphael
results
are
within
the
reach
of
any
beholder
provided
he
enrol
himself
with
ruskin
or
hearken
to
colvin
in
the
provinces
the
people
are
to
be
educated
upon
the
broad
basis
of
taste
forsooth
and
it
matters
but
little
what
gentleman
and
scholar
undertake
the
task
eloquence
alone
shall
guide
them
and
the
readiest
writer
or
wordiest
talker
is
perforce
their
professor
the
observatory
at
greenwich
under
the
direction
of
an
apothecary
the
college
of
physicians
with
tennyson
as
president
and
we
know
that
madness
is
about
but
a
school
of
art
with
an
accomplished
at
its
head
disturbs
no
one
and
is
actually
what
the
world
receives
as
rational
while
ruskin
writes
for
pupils
and
colvin
holds
forth
at
cambridge
still
quite
alone
stands
ruskin
whose
writing
is
art
and
whose
art
is
unworthy
his
writing
to
him
and
his
example
do
we
owe
the
outrage
of
proffered
assistance
from
the
unscientific
the
meddling
of
the
immodest
the
intrusion
of
the
garrulous
art
that
for
ages
has
hewn
its
own
history
in
marble
and
written
its
own
comments
on
canvas
shall
it
suddenly
stand
still
and
stammer
and
wait
for
wisdom
from
the
for
guidance
from
the
hand
that
holds
neither
brush
nor
chisel
out
upon
the
shallow
conceit
what
greater
sarcasm
can
ruskin
pass
upon
himself
than
that
he
preaches
to
young
men
what
he
can
not
perform
why
unsatisfied
with
his
own
conscious
power
should
he
choose
to
become
the
type
of
incompetence
by
talking
for
forty
years
of
what
he
has
never
done

discord
in

it
is
a
strong
saying
excellent
in
diction
broadly
and
boldly
set
down
in

the
point
whistler
raises

enforces
is
that
criticism
of

other

is
monstrous
and
not

be
tolerated

the
same
shock

that
was
balaam
when
the
first
great
critic
proffered
his
opinion
the
inference
is
that
all
the

incompetent

must
receive
the

in
silence

could

that

suggested
of

the

he

so
that
balaam

constrained
to
bow
his
head

fall
flat

thus
indeed
it
is
the
ass
sees
the
angel
of
the

there
where
the
wise
prophet
sees
nothing

by
her
seeing
saves
the
life

the
very
master
who
for
reward
smites
her
grievously
and
wishes
he
had
a
sword
that
he
might
kill
her
let
balaam
not
forget
that
after
all
he
rides
upon
the

that
she
has
served
him
well
ever
since
she
was
his
until
this

that

me
to

him
for

he

of
in
glowing

notably
the

has
been
the
occasion
of
one
of
those
squabbles
which
amuse
everybody
perhaps
even
including
the
quarrellers
themselves
some
etchings
exceedingly
like
whistler
in
manner
but
signed
frank
duveneck
were
sent
to
the
exhibition
from
venice
the
appear
to
have
suspected
for
a
moment
that
the
works
were
really
whistler
and
not
desiring
to
be
the
victims
of
an
easy
hoax
on
the
part
of
that
gentleman
three
of
their
members
seymour
haden
hamilton
and
legros
went
to
the
fine
art
society
gallery
in
new
bond
street
and
asked
one
of
the
assistants
there
to
show
them
some
of
whistler
venetian
plates
from
this
assistant
they
learned
that
whistler
was
under
an
arrangement
to
exhibit
and
sell
his
venetian
etchings
only
at
the
fine
art
society
gallery
but
even
if
these
really
believed
that
frank
duveneck
was
only
another
name
for
james
whistler
this
information
about
the
fine
art
society
arrangement
with
him
need
not
have
shaken
that
belief
for
the
de
might
easily
have
been
adopted
with
the
concurrence
of
the
society
leading
spirits
nor
is
it
altogether
certain
that
the
did
anything
more
than
compare
for
their
own
satisfaction
as
connoisseurs
the
works
of
whistler
and
frank
duveneck
the
motive
of
their
doing
so
may
have
been
misunderstood
by
the
fine
art
society
assistant
with
whom
they
conferred
be
that
as
it
may
this
assistant
thought
fit
to
repeat
to
whistler
what
had
passed
and
also
his
own
impressions
as
to
the
motive
of
the
comparison
and
the
inquiries
which
the
had
instituted
whereupon
whistler
has
addressed
a
letter
to
seymour
haden
who
is
by
the
way
of
which
all
that
need
be
here
said
is
that
it
is
extremely
characteristic
of
whistler

april
some

i
referred

that
was
brewed
and
had
burst
in

society
gallery
in

street
in

venice
etchings
it
seems
to
me
that
seymour
haden
legros
and
hamilton
stumbled
on
an
artistic
mare
nest
that
they
rashly
suggested
that
whistler
had
been
guilty
of
gross
misfeasance
in
publishing
etchings
in
an
assumed
name
and
that
they
are
now
trying
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
as
best
they
may
this
is
however
simply
an
opinion
formed
on
perusal
of
the
following
documents
which
i
here
present
to
my
readers
to
judge
of
the
following
paragraph
was
some
time
ago
sent
to
me
with
this
letter
if
the
editor
of

see
his
way

the
publication
of

among

market
whistler
and
the
our
explanation
of
this
in
a
turns
out
to
have
been
in
the
main
correct
it
appears
that
not
only
were
the
three
gentlemen
who
went
to
the
fine
art
society
gallery
to
look
at
whistler
etchings
guiltless
of
offence
but
that
the
object
of
their
going
there
was
actually
less
to
show
that
whistler
than
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
etchings
which
for
a
moment
had
puzzled
them
for
this
indeed
they
seem
to
have
given
each
other
in
the
presence
of
the
blundering
assistant
of
course
three
very
distinct
reasons
firstly
that
as
already
stated
seymour
haden
had
quite
seriously
written
to
duveneck
to
buy
the
etchings
secondly
that
they
at
once
accepted
as
satisfactory
and
sufficient
the
explanation
given
them
of
obligations
to
the
fine
art
society
and
thirdly
though
this
count
appears
to
have
somehow
slipped
altogether
out
of
the
indictment
they
were
one
and
all
of
opinion
that
taken
all
round
the
duveneck
etchings
were
the
of
the
two
sic
it
is
a
pity
a
clever
man
like
whistler
is
yet
not
clever
enough
to
see
that
while
habitual
public
attacks
on
a

not
fail
to
be
to
the

of
people
unpalatable

are
likely
to
be

directed
against
a
brother
etcher
even
i
did
not
at
the
time
see
my
way
to
publishing
the
paragraph
as
it
stands
but
having
subsequently
received
the
following

i

it

sir
mr

handed
me
your
letter
of
the
since
when
i
have
waited
in
vain
for
the
true
version
that
i
doubted
not
would
follow
the
representation
you
regret
i
should
have
received
now
i
must
ask
that
you
will
if
possible
without
further
delay
give
me
a
thorough
explanation
of
your
visit
to
the
fine
art
gallery
on
friday
evening
the
involving
as
it
did
a
discussion
of
my
private
affairs
did
you
accompanied
by
legros
and
hamilton
call
at
the
fine
art
society
rooms
on
that
date
and
ask
to
see
etchings
did
you
there
proceed
to
make
a
careful
and
minute
examination
of
these
and
then
ask
brown
if
whistler
had
done
other
etchings
of
venice
upon
his
answer
in
the
affirmative
did
you
ask
brown
if
any
of
the
other
plates
were
large
ones
and
notably
whether
whistler
had
done
any
other
plate
of
the
subject
called
riva
did
you
ask
to
see
the
early
states
of
whistler
etchings
did
you
say
to
brown
is
not
whistler
under
an
engagement
with
the
fine
art
society
to
publish
no
venice
etchings
for
a
year
or
words
to
that
effect
and
upon
brown
assurance
that
such
was
the
case
did
you
request
him
to
go
with
you
to
the
hanover
gallery
did
you
there
produce
for
his
inspection
three
large
venice
etchings
and
among
them
the
subject
did
you
then
incite
brown
to
detect
in
these
works
the
hand
of
mr
whistler
did
you
point
out
details
of
execution
which
in
your
opinion
betrayed
whistler
manner
did
you
say
see
these
etchings
are
signed
frank
duveneck
and
i
have
written
to
that
name
and
address
for
their
purchase
but
i
do
believe
in
the
existence
of
such
a
person
or
words
to
that
effect
if
this
be
not
so
why
did
you
take
brown
over
to
the
hanover
gallery
why
did
you
show
him
duveneck
venice
etchings
why
did
you
question
him
about
my
engagement
with
the
fine
art
society
is
it
officially
as
the
president
that
you
pry
about
the

these

to

gentlemen
i
have
hitherto
in

written
to
sir
william
drake
as
secretary
of
the
society
and
feeling
convinced
that
his
elaborate
silence
can
not
possibly
be
the
expression
of
any
intended
discourtesy
on
the
part
of
the
committee
as
a
body
but
that
it
would
rather
indicate
that
they
had
not
been
consulted
in
the
matter
at
all
i
now
address
myself
to
you
and
beg
that
you
will
kindly
inform
me
whether
the
committee
as
represented
by
their
officers
endorse
the
late
acts
of
their
president
or
whether
they
intend
taking
any
steps
towards
refusing
to
share
the
shame
and
ridicule
that
have
accrued
from
certain
proceedings
described
by
haden
as
a
necessary
duty
in
the
exercise
of
which
he
was
officially
engaged
in
conjunction
with
hamilton
and
legros
that
you
may
clearly
see
how
current
the
matter
has
become
i
have
the
honour
gentlemen
to
send
you
herewith
for
your
serious
consideration
extracts
from
the
daily
press
and
thus
as
you
will
read
carry
out
myself
the
first
intention
of
a
certain
speculative
piker
newsvendor
shepherd
market
who
had
purposed
circulating
among
you
twenty
copies
of
the
enclosed
literary
venture
curtailed
it
is
true
to
the
original
piker
paragraph
and
unaccompanied
by
the
piker
prospect
the
printing
of
which
may
who
knows
have
caused
a
wavering
on
the
part
of
piker
and
have
left
you
deprived
of
his
labour
after
all
piker
offers
matter
with
authority
and
here
i
would
point
out
the
proximity
of
shepherd
market
to
hertford
street
most
suggestive
is
such
contiguity
the
newsvendor
stall
and
the
doctor
office
within
hail
of
each
other
surely
i
may
without
indiscretion
congratulate
the
president
upon
piker
english
and
also
upon
the
pecksniffian
whine
about
the
rather
telling
in
its
way
but
shallow
shallow
for
after
all
gentlemen
a
is
a
connection
calling
for
sentiment
in
the
abstract
rather
an
intruder
than
a
near
relation
indeed
near
relation
is
mere
swagger
meanwhile
the
insinuation
of
jealousy
of
the
is
as
piker
puts
it
very
and
modest
and
transparent
to
the
last
paper
i
have
added
the
cutting
from
the
former
piker
earlier
effort
so
that
you
have
the
occasion
of
perceiving
how
the
progressive
piker
party
have
gained
in
courage
until
in
direct
contradiction
to
their
first
anxiety
and
hesitation
we
reach
the
final
of
the
three
representative
gentlemen
whose
visit
to
the
fine
art
society
rooms
it
would
appear
was
absolutely
to
prove
to
the
blundering
assistant
that
some
etchings
he
had
never
seen
and
consequently
never
had
questioned
of
the
very
existence
of
which
in
short
he
was
utterly
unconscious
were
by
a
duveneck
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
and
by
mr
whistler
a
fact
that
in
his
whole
life
he
had
never
been
in
a
position
to
dispute
and
of
which
three
themselves
were
the
only
who
had
ever
had
any
doubt
really
they
either
doubted
duveneck
or
they
did
doubt
duveneck
now
if
the
piker
party
did
doubt
duveneck
who
the

did
the

refer
you

my
letter
of

has
never

to
answer

merely
point
out
that
the
blundering

was
the
only
one
who
did
not
blunder
at
all
since
he
alone
refrained
from
folly

dissociate

no

that
the
habit
of
margin
again
dates
from

continues
with
the

his
unreasoning
connoisseurship
taking
curious
pleasure
in
the
quantity

that
the
picture
ending
where
the
frame
begins

in

inevitably
because
of
its

itself

obedient
servant

james
whistler
esq
sidenote
the
book
on
etching
james
whistler
is
of
american
extraction
and
studied
painting
in
france
as
a
student
he
was
capricious
and
irregular
and
did
not
leave
the
impression
amongst
his
that
his
future
would
be
in
any
way
distinguished
his
artistic
education
seems
to
have
been
mainly
acquired
by
private
and
independent
study
whistler
seems
to
be
aware
that
etchings
are
usually
sought
as
much
for
their
rarity
as
their
excellence
and
to
have
determined
that
his
own
plates
shall
be
rare
already
i
have
been
told
that
if
application
is
made
by
letter
to
whistler
for
a
set
of
his
etchings
he
may
perhaps
if
he
chooses
to
answer
the
letter
do
the
applicant
the
favour
to
let
him
have
a
copy
for
about
the

etchings
are
not
generally
remarkable
for
poetical
feeling

and
note
if
beauty
were
the
only
province
of
art
neither
painters
nor
etchers
would
find
anything
to
occupy
them

the
foul
stream
that
washes

wharfs

famous
woman
in
white
is
amongst
the
rejected
pictures
the
hangers
must
have
thought
her
particularly
ugly
for
they
have
given
her
a
sort
of
place
of
honour
before
an
opening
through
which
all
pass
so
that
nobody
misses
her
i
watched
several
parties
to
see
the
impression
the
woman
in
white
made
on
them
they
all
stopped
instantly
struck
with
amazement
this
for
two
or
three
seconds
then
they
always
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed

once

one
of
the
most
celebrated

painters

the
first
impression
of
an
englishman
on
looking
at
his
works
is
that
they
are
the
sketches
of
an
amateur
it
is
difficult
at
first
sight
to
consider

the
serious
performances
of
an

think
his

york
sir
in
for
this
month
there
appears
an
article
on
seymour
haden
the
eminent
surgeon
etcher
by
a
hamerton
and
in
this
article
i
have
stumbled
upon
a
curious
statement
concerning
strangely
enough
my
own
affairs
offered
pleasantly
in
the
disguise
of
an
anecdote
habitually
narrated
by
the
doctor
himself
and
printed
effectively
in
inverted
commas
as
here
shown
a
parallel
anecdote
is
narrated
by
haden
most
exquisite
series
of
plates
which
whistler
ever
did
his
sixteen
thames
subjects
were
originally
printed
by
a
printer
and
so
badly
that
the
owner
thought
the
plates
were
worn
out
and
sold
them
for
a
small
sum
in
comparison
to
their
real
worth
the
purchaser
took
them
to
goulding
the
best
printer
of
etchings
in
england
and
it
was
found
that
they
were
not
only
perfect
but
that
they
produced
impressions
which
had
never
before
been
approached
even
by
delatre
putting
gently
aside
the
question
of
these
plates
being
superior
to
all
previous
or
subsequent
work
and
dealing
merely
with
facts
i
have
to
say
that
they
were
originally
printed
by
a
printer
that
the
impressions
were
so
bad
that
the
owner
thought
the
plates
worn
out
and
flattering
as
is
the
supposition
that
they
were
sold
for
a
small
sum
in
comparison
to
their
real
worth
i
am
obliged
to
reject
even
this
palatable
assertion
as
i
received
for
the
plates
the
price
that
i
asked
knowing
full
well
their
exact
condition
instead
of
the
printer
delatre
then
at
his
prime
had
himself
printed
these
etchings
a
fact
which
amusingly
enough
haden
admits
further
on
in
direct
contradiction
to
his
first
broad
statement
moreover
i
had
myself
pulled
proofs
of
them
all
indeed
one
in
the
set
of
sixteen
plates
a
drypoint
called
the
forge
for
by
the
way
they
were
not
all
of
the
thames
i
alone
printed
when
the
plates
left
my
hands
they
were
taken
to
goulding
who
at
that
moment
had
i
fancy
barely
begun
his
career
as
the
best
printer
of
etchings
in
england
and
a
capital
printer
he
certainly
is
and
it
was
found
that
they
produced
impressions
never
before
approached
even
by
delatre
here
we
have
the
contradiction
alluded
to
no
this
theatrical
denouement
i
must
also
put
aside
with
sorrow
the
plates
were
brought
out
by
ellis
who
had
them
printed
by
some
one
in
london
whose
work
was
certainly
not
to
be
compared
to
that
of
delatre
whom
i
should
undoubtedly
have
recommended
so
that
was
only
long
after
the
sale
had
been
completed
and
the
plates
had
ceased
to
be
in
my
that
inferior
impressions
were
produced
the
understanding
on
my
part
with
those
publishers
was
that
the
plates
were
to
be
destroyed
after
one
hundred
impressions
had
been
taken
but
very
recently
they
reappeared
and
were
sold
to
their
present
possessors
who
take
them
to
goulding
and
here
i
am
obliged
to
explain
away
the
last
element
of
astonishment
for
goulding
naturally
found
the
etchings
in
their
original
perfect
condition
simply
because
i
had
had
them
steeled
in
their
full
bloom
when
i
had
satisfied
myself
by
my
own
proofs
goulding
impressions
of
these
plates
are
very
excellent
but
to
say
they
were
quite
unapproached
by
delatre
is
not
only
needless
exaggeration
but
an
unkindness
to
goulding
surely
there
must
be
some
misunderstanding
between
haden
and
his
biographer
a
misdeal
of
data
an
accident
with
the
anecdotes
because
no
one
was
more
keenly
alive
to
all
relating
to
these
plates
and
their
various
states
than
haden
himself
whose
strong
sense
of
the
importance
of
printing
was
acquired
while
watching
the
progress
of
these
same
plates
and
the
previous
french
set
as
they
were
proved
by
me
and
printed
by
delatre
to
whom
i
introduced
him
far
from
me
to
spoil
a
good
story
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
see
what
any
sympathizing
will
regret
in
the
destruction
of
this
mere
jumble
of
statistics
that
hamerton
calls

hamerton
presents
his
compliments
to

begs
to
inform
him
that
he
has
read
whistler
very
unbecoming
and
improper
letter
in

in

simply
quoted
a
passage
from
one

hamerton
did
not
offer
matter
to

has
answered

letter
in
the
same

in

it

it
is
possibly
too
much
to
expect
upon
the
principle
of

not
turning
up
twice
but
whistler
does
hope
that
letter
to
the

be
as
funny
as

to

has
just
been

that

what

the

to
care
about
the

of

the

is
a
poor
kind

he
sees
before

were

the

it
is
for
the

to
do
something
beyond
this
in

painting
to
put
on
canvas
something
more
than
the
face
the
model
wears
for
that
one

to
paint
the

in
short
as
well
as
his
features
in

of

to
treat
a

as

not
as

this
is
now
understood
indifferently
well
at

by

in

you
see
attention
is
paid
to
the
of

as

for

upon

within

can
breed
contempt
certainly
art
or
what
is
currently
taken
for
it
has
been
brought
to
its
lowest
stage
of
intimacy
the
people
have
been
harassed
with
art
in
every
guise
and
vexed
with
many
methods
as
to
its
endurance
they
have
been
told
how
they
shall
love
art
and
live
with
it
their
homes
have
been
invaded
their
walls
covered
with
paper
their
very
dress
taken
to
task
until
roused
at
last
bewildered
and
filled
with
the
doubts
and
discomforts
of
senseless
suggestion
they
resent
such
intrusion
and
cast
forth
the
false
prophets
who
have
brought
the
very
name
of
the
beautiful
into
disrepute
and
derision
upon
themselves
alas
ladies
and
gentlemen
art
has
been
maligned
she
has
naught
in
common
with
such
practices
she
is
a
goddess
of
dainty
thought
reticent
of
habit
abjuring
all
obtrusiveness
purposing
in
no
way
to
better
others
she
is
withal
selfishly
occupied
with
her
own
perfection
only
having
no
desire
to
teach
seeking
and
finding
the
beautiful
in
all
conditions
and
in
all
times
as
did
her
high
priest
rembrandt
when
he
saw
picturesque
grandeur
and
noble
dignity
in
the
quarter
of
amsterdam
and
lamented
not
that
its
inhabitants
were
not
greeks
as
did
tintoret
and
paul
veronese
among
the
venetians
while
not
halting
to
change
the
brocaded
silks
for
the
classic
draperies
of
athens
as
did
at
the
court
of
philip
velasquez
whose
infantas
clad
in
inæsthetic
hoops
are
as
works
of
art
of
the
same
quality
as
the
elgin
marbles
no
reformers
were
these
great
men
no
improvers
of
the
way
of
others
their
productions
alone
were
their
occupation
and
filled
with
the
poetry
of
their
science
they
required
not
to
alter
their
surroundings
for
as
the
laws
of
their
art
were
revealed
to
them
they
saw
in
the
development
of
their
work
that
real
beauty
which
to
them
was
as
much
a
matter
of
certainty
and
triumph
as
is
to
the
astronomer
the
verification
of
the
result
foreseen
with
the
light
given
to
him
alone
in
all
this
their
world
was
completely
severed
from
that
of
their
with
whom
sentiment
is
mistaken
for
poetry
and
for
whom
there
is
no
perfect
work
that
shall
not
be
explained
by
the
benefit
conferred
upon
themselves
humanity
takes
the
place
of
art
and
god
creations
are
excused
by
their
usefulness
beauty
is
confounded
with
virtue
and
before
a
work
of
art
it
is
asked
what
good
shall
it
do
hence
it
is
that
nobility
of
action
in
this
life
is
hopelessly
linked
with
the
merit
of
the
work
that
portrays
it
and
thus
the
people
have
acquired
the
habit
of
looking
as
who
should
say
not
a
picture
but
it
at
some
human
fact
that
shall
or
shall
not
from
a
social
point
of
view
better
their
mental
or
moral
state
so
we
have
come
to
hear
of
the
painting
that
elevates
and
of
the
duty
of
the
painter
of
the
picture
that
is
full
of
thought
and
of
the
panel
that
merely
decorates
a
favourite
faith
dear
to
those
who
teach
is
that
certain
periods
were
especially
artistic
and
that
nations
readily
named
were
notably
lovers
of
art
so
we
are
told
that
the
greeks
were
as
a
people
worshippers
of
the
beautiful
and
that
in
the
fifteenth
century
art
was
engrained
in
the
multitude
that
the
great
masters
lived
in
common
understanding
with
their
patrons
that
the
early
italians
were
artists
all
and
that
the
demand
for
the
lovely
thing
produced
it
that
we
of
in
gross
contrast
to
this
arcadian
purity
call
for
the
ungainly
and
obtain
the
ugly
that
could
we
but
change
our
habits
and
climate
were
we
willing
to
wander
in
groves
could
we
be
roasted
out
of
broadcloth
were
we
to
do
without
haste
and
journey
without
speed
we
should
again
the
spoon
of
queen
anne
and
pick
at
our
peas
with
the
fork
of
two
prongs
and
so
for
the
flock
little
hamlets
grow
near
hammersmith
and
the
steam
horse
is
scorned
useless
quite
hopeless
and
false
is
the
effort
built
upon
fable
and
all
because
a
wise
man
has
uttered
a
vain
thing
and
filled
his
belly
with
the
east
wind
listen
there
never
was
an
artistic
period
there
never
was
an
nation
in
the
beginning
man
went
forth
each
day
some
to
do
battle
some
to
the
chase
others
again
to
dig
and
to
delve
in
the
field
all
that
they
might
gain
and
live
or
lose
and
die
until
there
was
found
among
them
one
differing
from
the
rest
whose
pursuits
attracted
him
not
and
so
he
stayed
by
the
tents
with
the
women
and
traced
strange
devices
with
a
burnt
stick
upon
a
gourd
this
man
who
took
no
joy
in
the
ways
of
his
brethren
who
cared
not
for
conquest
and
fretted
in
the
field
this
designer
of
quaint
patterns
this
deviser
of
the
beautiful
who
perceived
in
nature
about
him
curious
curvings
as
faces
are
seen
in
the
fire
this
dreamer
apart
was
the
first
artist
and
when
from
the
field
and
from
afar
there
came
back
the
people
they
took
the
gourd
and
drank
from
out
of
it
and
presently
there
came
to
this
man
another
and
in
time
others
of
like
nature
chosen
by
the
gods
and
so
they
worked
together
and
soon
they
fashioned
from
the
moistened
earth
forms
resembling
the
gourd
and
with
the
power
of
creation
the
heirloom
of
the
artist
presently
they
went
beyond
the
slovenly
suggestion
of
nature
and
the
first
vase
was
born
in
beautiful
proportion
and
the
toilers
tilled
and
were
athirst
and
the
heroes
returned
from
fresh
victories
to
rejoice
and
to
feast
and
all
drank
alike
from
the
artists
goblets
fashioned
cunningly
taking
no
note
the
while
of
the
craftsman
pride
and
understanding
not
his
glory
in
his
work
drinking
at
the
cup
not
from
choice
not
from
a
consciousness
that
it
was
beautiful
but
because
forsooth
there
was
none
other
and
time
with
more
state
brought
more
capacity
for
luxury
and
it
became
well
that
men
should
dwell
in
large
houses
and
rest
upon
couches
and
eat
at
tables
whereupon
the
artist
with
his
artificers
built
palaces
and
filled
them
with
furniture
beautiful
in
proportion
and
lovely
to
look
upon
and
the
people
lived
in
marvels
of
art
and
ate
and
drank
out
of
masterpieces
for
there
was
nothing
else
to
eat
and
to
drink
out
of
and
no
bad
building
to
live
in
no
article
of
daily
life
of
luxury
or
of
necessity
that
had
not
been
handed
down
from
the
design
of
the
master
and
made
by
his
workmen
and
the
people
questioned
not
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
so
greece
was
in
its
splendour
and
art
reigned
supreme
by
force
of
fact
not
by
election
and
there
was
no
meddling
from
the
outsider
the
mighty
warrior
would
no
more
have
ventured
to
offer
a
design
for
the
temple
of
pallas
athene
than
would
the
sacred
poet
have
proffered
a
plan
for
constructing
the
catapult
and
the
amateur
was
unknown
and
the
dilettante
undreamed
of
and
history
wrote
on
and
conquest
accompanied
civilisation
and
art
spread
or
rather
its
products
were
carried
by
the
victors
among
the
vanquished
from
one
country
to
another
and
the
customs
of
cultivation
covered
the
face
of
the
earth
so
that
all
peoples
continued
to
use
what
artist
alone
and
centuries
passed
in
this
using
and
the
world
was
flooded
with
all
that
was
beautiful
until
there
arose
a
new
class
who
discovered
the
cheap
and
foresaw
fortune
in
the
facture
of
the
sham
then
sprang
into
existence
the
tawdry
the
common
the
gewgaw
the
taste
of
the
tradesman
supplanted
the
science
of
the
artist
and
what
was
born
of
the
million
went
back
to
them
and
charmed
them
for
it
was
after
their
own
heart
and
the
great
and
the
small
the
statesman
and
the
slave
took
to
themselves
the
abomination
that
was
tendered
and
preferred
it
and
have
lived
with
it
ever
since
and
the
artist
occupation
was
gone
and
the
manufacturer
and
the
huckster
took
his
place
and
now
the
heroes
filled
from
the
jugs
and
drank
from
the
bowls
with
understanding
noting
the
glare
of
their
new
bravery
and
taking
pride
in
its
worth
and
the
people
this
time
had
much
to
say
in
the
matter
and
all
were
satisfied
and
birmingham
and
manchester
arose
in
their
might
and
art
was
relegated
to
the
curiosity
shop
nature
contains
the
elements
in
colour
and
form
of
all
pictures
as
the
keyboard
contains
the
notes
of
all
music
but
the
artist
is
born
to
pick
and
choose
and
group
with
science
these
elements
that
the
result
may
be
beautiful
as
the
musician
gathers
his
notes
and
forms
his
chords
until
he
bring
forth
from
chaos
glorious
harmony
to
say
to
the
painter
that
nature
is
to
be
taken
as
she
is
is
to
say
to
the
player
that
he
may
sit
on
the
piano
that
nature
is
always
right
is
an
assertion
artistically
as
untrue
as
it
is
one
whose
truth
is
universally
taken
for
granted
nature
is
very
rarely
right
to
such
an
extent
even
that
it
might
almost
be
said
that
nature
is
usually
wrong
that
is
to
say
the
condition
of
things
that
shall
bring
about
the
perfection
of
harmony
worthy
a
picture
is
rare
and
not
common
at
all
this
would
seem
to
even
the
most
intelligent
a
doctrine
almost
blasphemous
so
incorporated
with
our
education
has
the
supposed
aphorism
become
that
its
belief
is
held
to
be
part
of
our
moral
being
and
the
words
themselves
have
in
our
ear
the
ring
of
religion
still
seldom
does
nature
succeed
in
producing
a
picture
the
sun
blares
the
wind
blows
from
the
east
the
sky
is
bereft
of
cloud
and
without
all
is
of
iron
the
windows
of
the
crystal
palace
are
seen
from
all
points
of
london
the
rejoices
in
the
glorious
day
and
the
painter
turns
aside
to
shut
his
eyes
how
little
this
is
understood
and
how
dutifully
the
casual
in
nature
is
accepted
as
sublime
may
be
gathered
from
the
unlimited
admiration
daily
produced
by
a
very
foolish
sunset
the
dignity
of
the
mountain
is
lost
in
distinctness
but
the
joy
of
the
tourist
is
to
recognise
the
traveller
on
the
top
the
desire
to
see
for
the
sake
of
seeing
is
with
the
mass
alone
the
one
to
be
gratified
hence
the
delight
in
detail
and
when
the
evening
mist
clothes
the
riverside
with
poetry
as
with
a
veil
and
the
poor
buildings
lose
themselves
in
the
dim
sky
and
the
tall
chimneys
become
campanili
and
the
warehouses
are
palaces
in
the
night
and
the
whole
city
hangs
in
the
heavens
and
fairyland
is
before
us
then
the
wayfarer
hastens
home
the
working
man
and
the
cultured
one
the
wise
man
and
the
one
of
pleasure
cease
to
understand
as
they
have
ceased
to
see
and
nature
who
for
once
has
sung
in
tune
sings
her
exquisite
song
to
the
artist
alone
her
son
and
her
master
her
son
in
that
he
loves
her
her
master
in
that
he
knows
her
to
him
her
secrets
are
unfolded
to
him
her
lessons
have
become
gradually
clear
he
looks
at
her
flower
not
with
the
enlarging
lens
that
he
may
gather
facts
for
the
botanist
but
with
the
light
of
the
one
who
sees
in
her
choice
selection
of
brilliant
tones
and
delicate
tints
suggestions
of
future
harmonies
he
does
not
confine
himself
to
purposeless
copying
without
thought
each
blade
of
grass
as
commended
by
the
inconsequent
but
in
the
long
curve
of
the
narrow
leaf
corrected
by
the
straight
tall
stem
he
learns
how
grace
is
wedded
to
dignity
how
strength
enhances
sweetness
that
elegance
shall
be
the
result
in
the
citron
wing
of
the
pale
butterfly
with
its
dainty
spots
of
orange
he
sees
before
him
the
stately
halls
of
fair
gold
with
their
slender
saffron
pillars
and
is
taught
how
the
delicate
drawing
high
upon
the
walls
shall
be
traced
in
tender
tones
of
orpiment
and
repeated
by
the
base
in
notes
of
graver
hue
in
all
that
is
dainty
and
lovable
he
finds
hints
for
his
own
combinations
and
thus
is
nature
ever
his
resource
and
always
at
his
service
and
to
him
is
naught
refused
through
his
brain
as
through
the
last
alembic
is
distilled
the
refined
essence
of
that
thought
which
began
with
the
gods
and
which
they
left
him
to
carry
out
set
apart
by
them
to
complete
their
works
he
produces
that
wondrous
thing
called
the
masterpiece
which
surpasses
in
perfection
all
that
they
have
contrived
in
what
is
called
nature
and
the
gods
stand
by
and
marvel
and
perceive
how
far
away
more
beautiful
is
the
venus
of
melos
than
was
their
own
eve
for
some
time
past
the
unattached
writer
has
become
the
middleman
in
this
matter
of
art
and
his
influence
while
it
has
widened
the
gulf
between
the
people
and
the
painter
has
brought
about
the
most
complete
misunderstanding
as
to
the
aim
of
the
picture
for
him
a
picture
is
more
or
less
a
hieroglyph
or
symbol
of
story
apart
from
a
few
technical
terms
for
the
display
of
which
he
finds
an
occasion
the
work
is
considered
absolutely
from
a
literary
point
of
view
indeed
from
what
other
can
he
consider
it
and
in
his
essays
he
deals
with
it
as
with
a
novel
a
history
or
an
anecdote
he
fails
entirely
and
most
naturally
to
see
its
excellences
or
demerits
artistic
and
so
degrades
art
by
supposing
it
a
method
of
bringing
about
a
literary
climax
it
thus
in
his
hands
becomes
merely
a
means
of
perpetrating
something
further
and
its
mission
is
made
a
secondary
one
even
as
a
means
is
second
to
an
end
the
thoughts
emphasised
noble
or
other
are
inevitably
attached
to
the
incident
and
become
more
or
less
noble
according
to
the
eloquence
or
mental
quality
of
the
writer
who
looks
the
while
with
disdain
upon
what
he
holds
as
mere
execution
a
matter
belonging
he
believes
to
the
training
of
the
schools
and
the
reward
of
assiduity
so
that
as
he
goes
on
with
his
translation
from
canvas
to
paper
the
work
becomes
his
own
he
finds
poetry
where
he
would
feel
it
were
he
himself
transcribing
the
event
invention
in
the
intricacy
of
the
en
and
noble
philosophy
in
some
detail
of
philanthropy
courage
modesty
or
virtue
suggested
to
him
by
the
occurrence
all
this
might
be
brought
before
him
and
his
imagination
be
appealed
to
by
a
very
poor
picture
indeed
i
might
safely
say
that
it
generally
is
meanwhile
the
poetry
is
quite
lost
to
him
the
amazing
invention
that
shall
have
put
form
and
colour
into
such
perfect
harmony
that
exquisiteness
is
the
result
he
is
without
understanding
the
nobility
of
thought
that
shall
have
given
the
artist
dignity
to
the
whole
says
to
him
absolutely
nothing
so
that
his
praises
are
published
for
virtues
we
would
blush
to
possess
while
the
great
qualities
that
distinguish
the
one
work
from
the
thousand
that
make
of
the
masterpiece
the
thing
of
beauty
that
it
is
have
never
been
seen
at
all
that
this
is
so
we
can
make
sure
of
by
looking
back
at
old
reviews
upon
past
exhibitions
and
reading
the
flatteries
lavished
upon
men
who
have
since
been
forgotten
altogether
but
upon
whose
works
the
language
has
been
exhausted
in
rhapsodies
that
left
nothing
for
the
national
gallery
a
curious
matter
in
its
effect
upon
the
judgment
of
these
gentlemen
is
the
accepted
vocabulary
of
poetic
symbolism
that
helps
them
by
habit
in
dealing
with
nature
a
mountain
to
them
is
synonymous
with
height
a
lake
with
depth
the
ocean
with
vastness
the
sun
with
glory
so
that
a
picture
with
a
mountain
a
lake
and
an
ocean
however
poor
in
paint
is
inevitably
lofty
vast
infinite
and
glorious
on
paper
there
are
those
also
sombre
of
mien
and
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
books
who
frequent
museums
and
burrow
in
crypts
collecting
comparing
compiling
classifying
contradicting
experts
these
for
whom
a
date
is
an
accomplishment
a
hall
mark
success
careful
in
scrutiny
are
they
and
conscientious
of
judgment
establishing
with
due
weight
unimportant
reputations
discovering
the
picture
by
the
stain
on
the
back
testing
the
torso
by
the
leg
that
is
missing
filling
folios
with
doubts
on
the
way
of
that
limb
disputatious
and
dictatorial
concerning
the
birthplace
of
inferior
persons
speculating
in
much
writing
upon
the
great
worth
of
bad
work
true
clerks
of
the

they
mix
memoranda
with

and
reducing

to

they

harangues

many
matters
and
of

in
all
save
his
subject
exhorting
denouncing

filled
with
wrath
and
earnestness
bringing
powers
of
persuasion
and
polish

torn
with
much

having
naught
to
impart
impressive

shallow
defiant
distressed
desperate

while
the

withal
again
he
ambles
pleasantly
from
all
point
and
through
many
volumes
escaping
scientific
assertion
babbles
of
green
fields
so
art
has
become
foolishly
confounded
with
education
that
all
should
be
equally
qualified
whereas
while
polish
refinement
culture
and
breeding
are
in
no
way
arguments
for
artistic
result
it
is
also
no
reproach
to
the
most
finished
scholar
or
greatest
gentleman
in
the
land
that
he
be
absolutely
without
eye
for
painting
or
ear

that
in

he

let
him
have
but
the
wit
to
say
so
and
not
feel
the
admission
a
proof
of
inferiority
art
happens
no
hovel
is
safe
from
it
no
prince
may
depend
upon
it
the
vastest
intelligence
can
not
bring
it
about
and
puny
efforts
to
make
it
universal
end
in
quaint
comedy
and
coarse
farce
this
is
as
it
should
be
and
all
attempts
to
make
it
otherwise
are
due
to
the
eloquence
of
the
ignorant
the
zeal
of
the
conceited
the
boundary
line
is
clear
far
from
me
to
propose
to
bridge
it
over
that
the
pestered
people
be
pushed
across
no
i
would
save
them
from
further
fatigue
i
would
come
to
their
relief
and
would
lift
from
their
shoulders
this
incubus
of
art
why
after
centuries
of
freedom
from
it
and
indifference
to
it
should
it
now
be
thrust
upon
them
by
the
blind
until
wearied
and
puzzled
they
know
no
longer
how
they
shall
eat
or
drink
how
they
shall
sit
or
stand
or
wherewithal
they
shall
clothe
themselves
without
afflicting
art
but
lo
there
is
much
talk
without
triumphantly
they
cry
beware
this
matter
does
indeed
concern
us
we
also
have
our
part
in
all
true
art
for
remember
the
touch
of
nature
that
the
whole
world
kin
true
indeed
but
let
not
the
unwary
jauntily
suppose
that
shakespeare
herewith
hands
him
his
passport
to
paradise
and
thus
permits
him
speech
among
the
chosen
rather
learn
that
in
this
very
sentence
he
is
condemned
to
remain
without
to
continue
with
the
common
this
one
chord
that
vibrates
with
all
this
one
touch
of
nature
that
calls
aloud
to
the
response
of
each
that
explains
the
popularity
of
the
bull
of
paul
potter
that
excuses
the
price
of
conception
this
one
unspoken
sympathy
that
pervades
humanity
is
vulgarity
vulgarity
under
whose
fascinating
influence
the
many
have
elbowed
the
few
and
the
gentle
circle
of
art
swarms
with
the
intoxicated
mob
of
mediocrity
whose
leaders
prate
and
counsel
and
call
aloud
where
the
gods
once
spoke
in
whisper
and
now
from
their
midst
the
dilettante
stalks
abroad
the
amateur
is
loosed
the
voice
of
the
æsthete
is
heard
in
the
land
and
catastrophe
is
upon
us
the
meddler
beckons
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
and
ridicule
threatens
the
fair
daughters
of
the
land
and
there
are
curious
converts
to
a
weird
in
which
all
instinct
for
attractiveness
all
freshness
and
sparkle
all
winsomeness
is
to
give
way
to
a
strange
vocation
for
the
unlovely
and
this
desecration
in
the
name
of
the
graces
shall
this
gaunt
distressed
abashed
mixture
of
and
desperate
assertion
call
itself
artistic
and
claim
cousinship
with
the
artist
who
delights
in
the
dainty
the
sharp
bright
gaiety
of
beauty
no
a
thousand
times
no
here
are
no
connections
of
ours
we
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
forced
to
seriousness
that
emptiness
may
be
hidden
they
dare
not
smile
while
the
artist
in
fulness
of
heart
and
head
is
glad
and
laughs
aloud
and
is
happy
in
his
strength
and
is
merry
at
the
pompous
pretension
the
solemn
silliness
that
surrounds
him
for
art
and
joy
go
together
with
bold
openness
and
high
head
and
ready
hand
fearing
naught
and
dreading
no
exposure
know
then
all
beautiful
women
that
we
are
with
you
pay
no
heed
we
pray
you
to
this
outcry
of
the
unbecoming
this
last
plea
for
the
plain
it
concerns
you
not
your
own
instinct
is
near
the
truth
your
own
wit
far
surer
guide
than
the
untaught
ventures
of
thick
heeled
apollos
what
will
you
up
and
follow
the
first
piper
that
leads
you
down
petticoat
lane
there
on
a
sabbath
to
gather
for
the
week
from
the
dull
rags
of
ages
wherewith
to
bedeck
yourselves
that
beneath
your
travestied
awkwardness
we
have
trouble
to
find
your
own
dainty
selves
oh
fie
is
the
world
then
exhausted
and
must
we
go
back
because
the
thumb
of
the
mountebank
jerks
the
other
way
costume
is
not
dress
and
the
wearers
of
wardrobes
may
not
be
doctors
of
taste
for
by
what
authority
shall
these
be
pretty
masters
look
well
and
nothing
have
they
invented
nothing
put
together
for
comeliness
sake
haphazard
from
their
shoulders
hang
the
garments
of
the
hawker
combining
in
their
person
the
motley
of
many
manners
with
the
medley
of
the
mummers
closet
set
up
as
a
warning
and
a
of
danger
they
point
to
the
disastrous
effect
of
art
upon
the
middle
classes
why
this
lifting
of
the
brow
in
deprecation
of
the
present
this
pathos
in
reference
to
the
past
if
art
be
rare
it
was
seldom
heretofore
it
is
false
this
teaching
of
decay
the
master
stands
in
no
relation
to
the
moment
at
which
he
occurs
a
monument
of
isolation
hinting
at
sadness
having
no
part
in
the
progress
of
his
fellow
men
he
is
also
no
more
the
product
of
civilisation
than
is
the
scientific
truth
asserted
dependent
upon
the
wisdom
of
a
period
the
assertion
itself
requires
the
to
make
it
the
truth
was
from
the
beginning
so
art
is
limited
to
the
infinite
and
beginning
there
can
not
progress
a
silent
indication
of
its
wayward
independence
from
all
extraneous
advance
is
in
the
absolutely
unchanged
condition
and
form
of
implement
since
the
beginning
of
things
the
painter
has
but
the
same
pencil
the
sculptor
the
chisel
of
centuries
colours
are
not
more
since
the
heavy
hangings
of
night
were
first
drawn
aside
and
the
loveliness
of
light
revealed
neither
chemist
nor
engineer
can
offer
new
elements
of
the
masterpiece
false
again
the
fabled
link
between
the
grandeur
of
art
and
the
glories
and
virtues
of
the
state
for
art
feeds
not
upon
nations
and
peoples
may
be
wiped
from
the
face
of
the
earth
but
art
it
is
indeed
high
time
that
we
cast
aside
the
weary
weight
of
responsibility
and
and
know
that
in
no
way
do
our
virtues
minister
to
its
worth
in
no
way
do
our
vices
impede
its
triumph
how
irksome
how
hopeless
how
superhuman
the
task
of
the
nation
how
sublimely
vain
the
belief
that
it
shall
live
nobly
or
art
perish
let
us
reassure
ourselves
at
our
own
option
is
our
virtue
art
we
in
no
way
affect
a
whimsical
goddess
and
a
capricious
her
strong
sense
of
joy
tolerates
no
dulness
and
live
we
never
so
spotlessly
still
may
she
turn
her
back
upon
us
as
from
time
immemorial
she
has
done
upon
the
swiss
in
their
mountains
what
more
worthy
people
whose
every
alpine
gap
yawns
with
tradition
and
is
stocked
with
noble
story
yet
the
perverse
and
scornful
one
will
none
of
it
and
the
sons
of
patriots
are
left
with
the
clock
that
turns
the
mill
and
the
sudden
cuckoo
with
difficulty
restrained
in
its
box
for
this
was
tell
a
hero
for
this
did
gessler
die
art
the
cruel
jade
cares
not
and
hardens
her
heart
and
hies
her
off
to
the
east
to
find
among
the
of
nankin
a
favourite
with
whom
she
lingers
fondly
caressing
his
blue
porcelain
and
painting
his
coy
maidens
and
marking
his
plates
with
her
six
marks
of
choice
indifferent
in
her
companionship
with
him
to
all
save
the
virtue
of
his
refinement
he
it
is
who
calls
her
he
who
holds
her
and
again
to
the
west
that
her
next
lover
may
bring
together
the
gallery
at
madrid
and
show
to
the
world
how
the
master
towers
above
all
and
in
their
intimacy
they
revel
he
and
she
in
this
knowledge
and
he
knows
the
happiness
untasted
by
other
mortal
she
is
proud
of
her
comrade
and
promises
that
in
others
shall
pass
that
way
and
understand
so
in
all
time
does
this
superb
one
cast
about
for
the
man
worthy
her
love
and
art
seeks
the
artist
alone
where
he
is
there
she
appears
and
remains
with
him
loving
and
fruitful
turning
never
aside
in
moments
of
hope
deferred
of
insult
and
of
ribald
misunderstanding
and
when
he
dies
she
sadly
takes
her
flight
though
loitering
yet
in
the
land
from
fond
association
but
refusing
to
be
consoled
note
and
so
have
we
the
ephemeral
influence
of
the
master
memory
the
afterglow
in
which
are
warmed
for
a
while
the
worker
and
disciple
with
the
man
then
and
not
with
the
multitude
are
her
intimacies
and
in
the
book
of
her
life
the
names
inscribed
are
few
scant
indeed
the
list
of
those
who
have
helped
to
write
her
story
of
love
and
beauty
from
the
sunny
morning
when
with
her
glorious
greek
relenting
she
yielded
up
the
secret
of
repeated
line
as
with
his
hand
in
hers
together
they
marked
in
marble
the
measured
rhyme
of
lovely
limb
and
draperies
flowing
in
unison
to
the
day
when
she
dipped
the
brush
in
light
and
air
and
made
his
people
live
within
their
frames
and
upon
their
that
all
nobility
and
sweetness
and
tenderness
and
magnificence
should
be
theirs
by
right
ages
had
gone
by
and
few
had
been
her
choice
countless
indeed
the
horde
of
pretenders
but
she
knew
them
not
a
teeming
seething
busy
mass
whose
virtue
was
industry
and
whose
industry
was
vice
their
names
go
to
fill
the
catalogue
of
the
collection
at
home
of
the
gallery
abroad
for
the
delectation
of
the
bagman
and
the
critic
therefore
have
we
cause
to
be
merry
and
to
cast
away
all
care
resolved
that
all
is
well
as
it
ever
was
and
that
it
is
not
meet
that
we
should
be
cried
at
and
urged
to
take
measures
enough
have
we
endured
of
dulness
surely
are
we
weary
of
weeping
and
our
tears
have
been
cozened
from
us
falsely
for
they
have
called
out
woe
when
there
was
no
grief
and
alas
where
all
is
fair
we
have
then
but
to
wait
until
with
the
mark
of
the
gods
upon
him
there
come
among
us
again
the
chosen
who
shall
continue
what
has
gone
before
satisfied
that
even
were
he
never
to
appear
the
story
of
the
beautiful
is
already
complete
hewn
in
the
marbles
of
the
parthenon
and
broidered
with
the
birds
upon
the

last
night
at
prince
hall
whistler
made
his
first
public
appearance
as
a
lecturer
on
art
there
were
some
arrows
shot
off
and
o
culpa
at

reformers
most
of
all
that
an
artist
will
find
beauty
in
ugliness
beau
dans
is
now
a
commonplace
of
the
schools
i
differ
entirely
from
whistler
an
artist
is
not
an
isolated
fact
he
is
the
resultant
of
a
certain
and
a
certain
and
can
no
more
be
born

most
people
who

anything
about
painting
in
its
highest
style
of
religious
and
monumental
art
thought
a
most
interesting
display
of
a
painter
career
is
described
by
this
most
genial
of
critics
as
acres
of
pallid
purple
canvases
with
wizened
saints
and
virgins
in
attitudinizing
groups
whether
that
collection
of
herbert
works
had
merit
or
not

matter
of
opinion
which
i
am
not

dispute

as
a

there
were
only
small

the
seven

which
the

purchased
for
their
gallery
of
art
and
several
fine
works
of
his
youth
such
as
the
brides
of
venice
a
procession
in

which
won
for
him
his

the

really

the
people
never
look

by
the
way
they
also
never

unconsciously
from

what
they

there

one
flesh

circumstances
whether
the
person
painted
be
in
the
soft
light
of
the
room
or
out
in
the
glare
of
the
open
the
one
aim
of
the
unsuspecting
painter
is
to
make
his
man
stand
out
from
the
frame
never
doubting
that
on
the
contrary
he
should
really
and
in
truth
absolutely
does
stand

frame

at
a
depth
behind
it
equal
to
the
distance
at

the

the

indeed
the
window

nothing
could
be
more
offensively

this
brutal

this

the
false
condition
of

to
which
all

in
the

has

the

the
round
of
the
papers
to
the
effect
that
john
burr
and
reid
have
withdrawn
from
the
society
of
british
artists
this
tardy
statement
acquires
undue
significance
at
this
moment
with
a
tendency
to
mislead
implying
as
it
might
that
these
resignations
were
in
consequence
of
and
intended
as
a
marked
disapproval
of
the
determined
stand
made
by
the
society
in
excluding
from
their
coming
exhibition
the
masses
of
commonplace
work
hitherto
offered
to
the
public
in

such
importance
attaches

their
resignations

in
proof
of
his
correction
that
their

might
have
gone
further

added
that
their
secession
corresponded
in

with
his
own
election
as
president
it
is
well
known
to
artists
that
one
if
not
both
of
these
gentlemen
left

that
changes
of
policy
of
which
they
could
not
approve
were
inevitable

will
be
for

decide
whether
the

view
next

are
more
interesting
than
the
work
of

the
anonymous
british

says
that

denies
that
the

policy
of
the
society
of

was
the
cause
of
the
secession
of
reid

burr
from

of
that

far
from
me
to
propose
to
penetrate
the
motives
of
such
withdrawal
but
what
i
did
deny
was
that
it
could
possibly
be
caused
as
its
strangely
late
announcement
seemed
sweetly
to
insinuate
by
the
strong
determination
to
tolerate
no
longer
the
mediocre
work
that
had
hitherto
habitually
swarmed
the
walls
of
suffolk
street
this
is
a
plain
question
of
date
and
i
pointed
out
that
these
two
gentlemen
left
the
society
six
months
ago
long
before
the
supervising
committee
were
called
upon

act
at
all

regrets
that
i
do
not
go
further
and
straightway
goes
further
himself

scarcely
fares
better
when
with
a
quaintness
of
rare
at
this
moment
he
proposes
that
it
will
be
for
the
patrons
of
the
gallery
to
decide
whether
the
more
than
walls
are
more
interesting
than
the
works
of
many
artists
of
more
than
the
average
merit
now
it
will
be
for
the
patrons
to
decide
absolutely
nothing
it
is
and
will
always
be
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
hanging
committee
alone
duly
chosen
to
decide
whether
empty
space
be
preferable
to
poor
pictures
whether
in
short
it
be
their
duty
to
cover
walls
merely
that
walls
may
be
covered
no
matter
with
what
quality
of
work
indeed
the
period
of
the
patron
has
utterly
passed
away
and
the
painter
takes
his
place
to
point
out
what
he
knows
to
be
consistent
with
the
demands
of
his
art
without
deference
to
patrons
or
prejudice
to
party
beyond
this
whether
the
policy
of

the

dear

permit
me
to
call
your
courteous
attention
to
the
fact
that
the

in

to
an

that
appeared

that
as

sign
my

in
full
i
alone
am
responsible
for
its
tone
or
form
indeed
that
such
is
its
tone
and
form
is
because
it
is
my
letter
in
common
fairness
the
answer
to
or
comment
upon
any
statements
made
in
your
paper
should
be
published
in

as
proper
etiquette
prevents
its
insertion
in

you
surely
would
not
propose
to
dictate
certain
forms
or
styles
in
which
alone
the
columns
of

to
be
approached
as
who
should
say
all
other
savour
of
sacrilege
or
acquiescence
alone
would
do
and
you
would
have
to
write
all
your

yourselves
my
letter
concerns
the
effect
produced
by
criticism
of
a
commonplace
and
inferior
kind
wholly
unworthy

first

in

i
am
startled
to
learn
and
still
unwilling
to
believe
that

shun
all
ventilation
and
refuse
to
publish
any
letter
as
its
sole
means
of
screening
its
staff
or
protecting
its
writers
i
submit
that
the
tone
of
my
letter
sins
against
no
laws
that
are
accepted
in
antagonism
that
it
offends
in
no
way
the
etiquette
of
attack
known
to

i
beg
therefore
again

if
there

still

for
its
insertion

in
his

your

ventures
the
opinion

the
man
that
such
opinion
is
out
of
place
and
stultifying
in
a
question
of

never
occurs
to
him

it
is
therefore
frankly
cited
as
in
a
way
conclusive
the
train
of
thought
that
justified
the
importance
attached
to
this
poor
opinion
at
all
would
seem
to
be
the
same
that
pervades
the
writing
throughout
until
it
becomes
difficult
to
discover
where
the
easy
effrontery
and
of
the
one
nothing
doubting
cease
and
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
the
experienced
expert
begin
so
that
one
unconsciously
confounds
the
incautious
critic
with
the
plausible
plain
person
who
finally
becomes
the
same
authority

plainness
certainly
is
the
characteristic

bewilderment
among

naturally
the
fate
of
the
man

when
put
forth
in
the
his
utterances
however
empty
acquire
a
semblance
of
sense

that
while
he
gravely
descants
with
bald
assurance
upon
the
engineering
of

light
in

being
misled

at
once

is
qualified

ignorance
alone
to
continue

me
therefore
to
rectify
inconsequent
impressions

tell
your
readers
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
of
colour
walls
or
drapery
that
the
battens
should
removed
that
they
are
meant
to
remain
not
only
for
their
use
but
as
bringing
parallel
lines
into
play

subdivide
charmingly
the

portion

other
night
i
congratulate
the
society
on
the
result
of
their
vote
for
no
longer
can
it
be
said
that
the
right
man
is
in
the
wrong
place
no
doubt
their
pristine
sense
of
undisturbed
somnolence
will
again
settle
upon
them
after
the
exasperated
mental
condition
arising
from
the
unnatural
strain
recently
put
upon
the
old
ship
eh
what
ha
ha
you
do
not
then
consider
the
society
as
out
of
date
you
do
not
think
as
is
sometimes
said
that
the
establishment
of
the
grosvenor
took
away
the
and
original
intention
of
the
society
that
of
being
a
foil
to
the
royal
academy
i
can
hardly
say
what
was
originally
intended
but
i
do
know
that
it
was
originally
full
of
hope
and
even
determination
shown
in
a
manner
by
their
getting
a
royal
charter
the
only
art
society
in
london
i
believe
that
has
one
but
by
degrees
it
lapsed
into
a
condition
of
incapacity
a
sort
of
secondary
state
do
you
see
till
it
acknowledged
itself
a
species
of
for
the
royal
academy
certain
it
is
that
when
i
came
into
it
the
prevalent
feeling
among
all
the
men
was
that
their
best
work
should
go
to
place
i
felt
that
this
sense
of
inferiority
was
fatal
to
the
of
the
place
for
that
reason
i
attempted
to
bring
about
a
sense
of
de
and
ambition
which
culminated
in
what
might
be
called
first
offence
by
my
proposition
that
members
belonging
to
other
societies
should
hold
no
official
position
in
ours
i
wanted
to
make
it
an
art
centre
continued
whistler
with
a
sudden
vigour
and
an
earnestness
for
which
the
public
would
hardly
give
credit
to
this
master
of
badinage
and
apostle
of
persiflage
they
wanted
it
to
remain
a
shop
although
i
said
to
them
do
you
perceive
that
as
shopmen
you
have
already
failed
do
you
see
eh
but
they
were
under
the
impression
that
the
sales
decreased
under
my
methods
and
my
and
ignored
the
fact
that
sales
had
declined
all
over
the
country
from
all
sorts
of
causes
commercial
and
so
on
their
only
chance
lay
in
the
art
tone
of
the
place
for
the
pictures
had
ceased
to
become
saleable
wares
buyers
simply
would
buy
them
but
members
work
i
by
the
rules
eliminate
only
the
bad
outsiders
were
choked
off
then
how
do
you
explain
the
bitterness
of
all
the
opposition
a
question
of
devil
pull
baker
and
the
devil
has
gone
and
the
bakers
remain
in
suffolk
street
ha
ha
here
is
a
list
of
the
fiendish
party
who
protested
against
the
thrusting
forth
of
their
president
in
such
an
unceremonious
way

then
my

they
brought

the

the

literally
like

they
brought
up
everything

do

but
all
this
hardly
explains
the
bitterness
of
the
feud
and
personal
enmity
to
you
what
do
you
see
my
presidential
career
had
in
a
manner
been
a
busy
one
when
i
took
charge
of
the
ship
i
found
her
more
or
less
well
i
put
the
men
to
the
pumps
and
thoroughly
shook
up
the
old
vessel
had
her
and
painted
and
finally
i
was
graciously
permitted
to
run
up
the
royal
standard
to
the
masthead
and
brought
her
fully
to
the
fore
ready
for
action
as
became
a
royal
flagship
and
as
a
natural
result
mutiny
at
once
set
in
do
you
see
he
continued
with
one
of
his
strident
laughs
what
might
be
considered
by
the
thoughtless
as
benefits
were
resented
by
the
older
and
wiser
of
the
crew
as
innovations
and
intrusions
of
an
impertinent
and
offensive
nature
but
the
immediate
result
was
that
interest
in
the
society
was
undeniably
developed
not
only
at
home
but
certainly
abroad
notably
in
paris
all
the
art
circle
was
keenly
alive
to
what
was
taking
place
in
suffolk
street
and
although
their
interest
in
other
institutions
in
this
country
had
previously
flagged
there
was
the
strong
willingness
to
take
part
in
its
exhibitions
for
example
there
was
alfred
stevens
who
showed
his
own
sympathy
with
the
progressive
efforts
by
becoming
a
member
and
look
at
the
throngs
of
people
that
crowded
our
private
views
eh
ha
ha
what
but
what
will
you
the
question
is
after
all
purely
a
parochial
one
and
here
i
would
stop
to
wonder
if
i
do
not
seem
pathetic
and
out
of
character
why
the
artist
is
naturally
an
object
of
vituperation
to
the
vestryman
why
am
who
of
course
as
you
know
am
charming
why
am
i
the
pariah
of
my
parish
why
should
these
people
do
other
than
delight
in
me
why
should
they
perish
rather
than
forgive
the
one
who
had
thrust
upon
them
honour
and
success
and
the
moral
of
it
all
whistler
became
impressive
almost
imposing
as
he
stroked
his
moustache
and
tried
to
hide
a
smile
behind
his
hand
the
organisation
of
this
society
of
british
artists
as
shown
by
its
very
name
tended
perforce
to
this
final
convulsion
resulting
in
the
separation
of
the
elements
of
which
it
was
composed
they
could
not
remain
together
and
so
you
see
the
have
come
out
and
the
remain
and
peace
and
sweet
obscurity
are
restored
to
suffolk
street
eh
what
ha
ha
illustration
sidenote
mall
july
since
our
interview
with
whistler
curious
statements
have
been
set
afloat
concerning
the
question
of
finance
giving
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
disaster
brought
upon
the
society
by
the
enforcement
of
the
whistlerian
policy
this
evidence
which
is
very
interesting
is
as
follows
the
sales
of
the
society
during
the
year
were
under
under
under
under
the
first
year
of
whistler
rule
they
fell
to
under
under
under
and
the
present
year
under
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
of
the
society
having
made
itself
responsible
to
whistler
for
a
loan
raised
by
him
to
meet
a
sudden
expenditure
for
repairs
is
also
true
but
the
unwisdom
of
the
president
and
members
of
any
society
having
money
transactions
between
them
need
hardly
be
commented
upon
here
wyke
bayliss
the
new
president
strikes
one
as
being
a
strong
man
shrewd
logical
and
the
author
of
several
books
and
pamphlets
on
the
more
imaginative
realm
of
art
he
is
one
would
say
as
much
permeated
by
religion
as
he
is
by
art
to
both
of
these
qualities
curiously
enough
his
canvases
which
usually
deal
with
cathedral
interiors
of
cheery
hue
bear
witness
the
hero
of
three
bond
street
exhibitions
a
chairman
a
lecturer
champion
of
surrey
a
member
of
the
rochester
diocesan
council
a
shaksperian
student
a
fellow
of
the
society
of
cyclists
a
fellow
of
the
society
of
antiquarians
and
public
orator
of
noviomagus
he
is
surely
one
of
the
most
versatile
men
who
ever
occupied
a
presidential
chair
the
editor
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
sir
the
royal
society
of
british
artists
is
perhaps
by
this
time
again
unknown
to
your
agitated
readers
but
i
would
recall
a
brilliant
number
of
the
mall
july
in
which
mischievous
amusement
was
sought
with
statistics
from
a
newly
elected
president
bayliss
wyke
believing
it
to
be
in
an
official
and
dull
way
more
becoming
that
the
appointed
council
of
this
same
society
should
deal
with
the
resulting
chaos
i
have
until
now
waited
for
a
slight
washing
of
hands
as
who
should
say
on
their
part
as
representing
the
gentle
deprecation
of
i
assure
you
the
respectable
body
in
suffolk
street
well
no
it
was
doubtless
adjudged
wiser
or
milder
to
live
it
down
and
now
it
i
really
believe
behoves
me
in
a
weary
way
to
remind
you
of
the
document
in
question
and
for
the
sake
of
commonplace
uninteresting
and
foolish
fact
to
lift
up
my
parable
and
declare
fallacious
that
which
was
supposed
to
be
true
and
generally
to
bore
myself
and
perhaps
even
you
the
one
with
what
i
fear
we
others
care
but
little
for
parish
matters
in
the
article
then
entitled
the
royal
society
of
british
artists
and
its
future
an
interview
with
the
new
president
a
most
appalling
volley
of
figures
was
fired
off
at
distance
under
this
deafening
detonation
i
having
no
habit
sat
for
days
incapable
dreaming
vaguely
that
when
a
president
should
see
fit
to
wash
his
people
linen
in
the
open
there
must
be
indeed
crime
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
offender
at
whose
instigation
such
official
sacrifice
of
dignity
could
come
about
was
the
offender
and
for
a
while
i
sincerely
believed
that
disaster
had
been
brought
upon
this
royal
society
by
my
own
casual
self
but
behold
upon
closer
inspection
these
threatening
figures
are
meretricious
and
misleading
as
was
the
building
account
of
the
early
philanthropist
who
in
the
days
of
paul
meant
well
and
was
abruptly
discouraged
by
that
apostle
bayliss
tells
us
that
the
sales
of
the
society
during
the
year
were
under
whatever
that
may
mean
under
under
under
in
first
year
of
whistler
rule
they
fell
to
under
under
under
and
the
present
year
under
but
also
bayliss
takes
this
rare
occasion
of
attention
to
assert
his
various
qualifications
for
his
post
as
head
of
painters
in
the
street
of
suffolk
and
so
we
learn
that
he
is
chairman
of
the
in
his
own
district
champion
of
surrey
a
member
of
the
diocesan
council
of
rochester
fellow
of
the
society
of
cyclists
and
public
orator
of
noviomagus
as
he
may
have
intuitively
bethought
himself
of
a
move
possibly
the
happy
one
who
knows
which
in
the
provinces
obtained
him
a
cup
as
diocesan
councilman
he
may
have
supposed
rochester
indifferent
to
the
means
used
for
an
end
but
as
public
cyclist
of
the
royal
society
of
noviomagus
his
experience
must
be
opposed
to
any
such
bluff
as
going
his
entire
pile
on
a
left
bower
only
when
i
recovered
my
courage
what
did
i
find
first
my
unimpaired
intelligence
and
then
my
memory
now
to
my
intelligence
it
becomes
patent
that
the
chairman
of
a
clapham
proposes
by
his
figures
to
prove
that
the
income
of
the
sacrificed
society
had
of
late
years
steadily
increased
in
under
under
under
under
until
under
the
baneful
reign
of
terror
and
whistler
in
the
first
year
of
the
sacrilegious
era
the
receipts
fell
to
and
have
continued
to
decrease
until
in
this
present
year
they
fall
to
the
miserable
sum
of
under
a
thousand
pounds
a
revelation
discreet
statesmanlike
and
worthy
the
orator
at
his
best
unfortunately
for
the
triumph
of
such
audacious
demonstration
my
revived
memory
points
out
that
whistler
was
only
elected
president
in
june
and
in
conformity
with
the
ancient
rules
and
amusing
customs
of
the
venerable
body
only
came
into
office
six
months
afterwards
that
is
practically
in
january
again
with
this
last
exhibition
he
as
everybody
knows
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
immediately
therefore
the
conclusion
is
quite
other
than
that
put
forth
by
the
cyclist
of
his
suburb
and
we
arrive
at
the
for
once
not
unamusing
fact
that
the
disastrous
and
simple
painter
whistler
only
took
in
hand
the
reins
of
government
at
least
a
year
after
the
former
driver
had
been
pitched
from
his
box
and
half
the
had
been
already
lost
from
to
at
one
fatal
swoop
and
the
beginning
of
the
end
had
set
in
indeed
this
may
have
been
one
of
the
strong
reasons
for
his
own
election
by
an
overwhelming
minority
of
hysterical
and
passengers
now
though
he
did
his
best
and
cried
aloud
that
the
coach
was
safe

called
it

will
you
tell

the

of

i
was

of
the

i
offered
to
paint
a
signboard
which
should
proclaim
to
the
the
name
and
nature
of
the

my
offer
was
accepted
and
the
board
was
sent
down
to
my
studio
where
i
treated
it
as
i
should
a
most
distinguished
sitter
as
a
picture
or
an
etching
throwing
my
artistic
soul
into
the
board
which
gradually
became

as
it
grew
into

you
say
they
say
it
was
only
a

mendacity
could
go
no

i
painted

lay
with
the

with
which
i
had
taken
as
much
trouble
as
i
did
with
the
best
picture
i
ever
painted
and
now
they
have
clothed
my
golden
lion
clumsily
awkwardly

timorously
with
a
dirty
coat
of
black
my

has
gone
the

which
i
had
treated
decoratively
have
disappeared
am

not
justified
in
calling
it
a

of
gross
vandalism

compliments

sidenote
to
the
editor
of
morning
sir
as
you
have
considered
whistler
letter
worthy
of
publication
i
ask
you
to
complete
the
publication
by
inserting
this
simple
statement
of
the
facts
as
they
occurred
the
notice
board
of
the
royal
society
of
british
artists
bears
on
a
red
ground
in
letters
of
gold
the
title
of
the
society
to
this
whistler
during
his
presidency
added
with
his
own
hand
a
decorative
device
of
a
lion
and
a
butterfly
on
the
eve
of
our
private
view
it
was
found
that
while
the
title
of
the
society
being
in
pure
gold
remained
untarnished
whistler
designs
being
executed
in
spurious
metals
had
nearly
disappeared
and
what
little
remained
of
them
was
of
a
dirty
brown
the
board
could
not
be
put
up
in
that
state
the
lion
however
was
not
so
badly
drawn
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
do
anything
more
than
restore
it
in
permanent
colour
and
that
has
accordingly
been
done
but
as
the
notice
board
was
no
longer
the
actual
work
of
whistler
it
would
manifestly
have
been
improper
to
have
left
the
butterfly
his
signature
attached
to
it
even
if
it
had
not
appeared
in
so
crushed
a
state
the
soiled
butterfly
was
therefore
effaced

morning
sir
i
have
read
bayliss
letter
and
am
disarmed
i
feel
the
folly
of
kicking
against
the

these
things
are

the

shall

more

have
been
effaced
from
the
board
that
belongs
to
us
i
shall
be
justified
and
it
will
be
boldly
denied
by
some

april
sir
the
moment
has
now
arrived
when
it
seems
to
me
proper
that
in
your
journal
one
of
the
recognized
art
organs
of
the
country
should
be
recorded
the
details
of
an
incident
in
which
the
element
of
grave
offence
is
not
unnaturally
quite
missed
by
the
people
in
their
indignation
at
the
insignificance
of
the
object
to
which
public
attention
has
so
unwarrantably
been
drawn
a
notice
board
the
common
sign
of
commerce
now
however
slight
might
be
the
value
of
the
work
in
question
destroyed
it
is
surely
of
startling
interest
to
know
that
may
be
or
worse
still
defaced
and
tampered
with
at
the
present
moment
in
full
london
with
the
joyous
approval
of
the
major
part
of
the
popular
press
i
leave
to
your
comment
the
fact
that
in
this
instance
the
act
is
committed
with
the
tacit
consent
of
a
body
of
gentlemen
officially
styled
artists
at
the
instigation
of
their
president
as
he
unblushingly
acknowledges
and
will
here
distinctly
state
that
the
notice
board
of
the
royal
society
of
british
artists
bear
on
a
red
ground
in
letters
of
gold
the
title
of
the
society
and
that
to
this
whistler
during
his
presidency
add
with
his
own
hand
a
decorative
device
of
a
lion
and
a
butterfly
this
damning
evidence
though
in
principle
irrelevant
for
what
becomes
of
the
soul
of
a
diocesan
member
of
the
council
of
clapham
is
artistically
a
matter
of
small
moment
i
nevertheless
bring
forward
as
the
only
one
that
will
at
present
be
at
all
considered
or
even
understood
the
notice
board
was
of
the
familiar
blue
enamel
well
known
in
metropolitan
use
with
white
lettering
announcing
that
the
exhibition
of
the
incorporated
society
of
british
artists
was
held
above
and
that
for
the
sum
of
one
shilling
the
public
might
enter
i
myself
mixed
the
red
ground
and
myself
placed
in
letters
of
gold
the
title
upon
it
in
proper
relation
to
the
decorative
scheme
of
the
whole
design
of
which
it
formed
naturally
an
feature
the
date
was
that
of
the
society
royal
grant
and
in
commemoration
of
its
new
birth
with
the
offending
butterfly
it
has
now
been
effaced
in
one
clean
sweep
of
independence
while
the
lion
not
so
badly
drawn
was
differently
dealt
with
it
was
found
not
necessary
to
do
anything
more
than
restore
it
in
permanent
colour
and
that
with
a
bottle
of
brunswick
black
has
accordingly
been
done
and
as
bayliss
adds
with
unpremeditated
truth
in
the
thoughtless
pride
of
achievement
the
notice
board
was
no
longer
the
actual
work
of
mr
whistler
this
exposure
of
bayliss
direct
method
i
have
wickedly
withheld
in
order
that
the
philistine
impulse
of
the
country
should
declare
itself
in
all
its
freshness
of
execration
before
it
could
be
checked
by
awkward
discovery
of
mere
mendacity
and
a
timid
sense
of
danger
called
justice
everything
has
taken
place
as
i
pleasantly
foresaw
and
there
is
by
this
time
with
the
silent
exception
of
one
or
two
cautious
dailies
scarcely
a
lay
paper
in
the
land
that
has
been
able
to
refrain
from
joining
in
the
hearty
yell
of
delight
at
the
rare
chance
of
coarsely
publicly
and
safely
insulting
an
artist
in
this
eagerness
to
affront
the
man
they
have
irretrievably
and
ridiculously
committed
themselves
to
open
sympathy
with
the
destruction
of
his
work
i
wish
coldly
to
chronicle
this
fact
in
the
archives
of
the
for
the
future
consideration
of

the

day
i
happened
to
call
on
blank
japanese
blank
you
know
whose
house
is
in
far
fulham
the
garden
door
flew
open
at
my
summons
and
my
eye
was
at
once
confronted
with
a
house
the
hue
of
whose
face
reminded
me
of
a
venetian
palazzo
for
it
was
of
a
subdued
pink
if
the
exterior
was
venetian
however
the
interior
was
a
compound
of
blank
and
japan
attracted
by
the
curiously
pretty
hall
i
begged
the
artist
to
explain
this
the
newest
style
of
house
decoration
i
need
not
say
that
blank
being
a
man
of
an
turn
of
mind
with
the
decorative
bump
strongly
developed
holds
what
are
at
present
peculiar
views
upon
wall
papers
room
tones
and
so
on
the
day
is
dark
and
gloomy
yet
once
within
the
halls
of
blank
there
is
sweetness
and
light
you
must
look
through
the
open
door
into
a
luminous
little
chamber
covered
with
a
soft
wash
of
lemon
yellow
from
the
antechamber
we
passed
through
the
open
door
into
a
large
of
the
same
soft
hue
the
blinds
were
down
the
fog
reigned
without
and
yet
you
would
have
thought
that
the
sun
was
in
the
room
here
let
me
pause
in
my
description
and
put
on
record
the
gist
of
our
conversation
concerning
the
home
of
taste
now
blank
would
you
tell
me
how
you
came
to
prefer
tones
to
papers
here
the
walls
used
to
be
covered
with
a
paper
of
a
sombre
green
which
oppressed
me
and
made
me
sad
said
blank
can
not
i
bring
the
sun
into
the
house
i
said
to
myself
in
this
land
of
fog
and
clouds
then
i
thought
of
my
experiment
and
invoked
the
aid
of
the
british
he
brought
his
colours
and
his
buckets
and
i
stood
over
him
as
he
mixed
his
washes
one
night
when
the
work
was
nearing
completion
one
of
them
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
mirror
and
remarked
with
astonishment
upon
the
loveliness
of
his
own
features
it
was
the
beautifying
the
british
workman
flesh
tones
i
assure
you
the
effect
of
a
room
full
of
people
in
evening
dress
seen
against
the
yellow
ground
is
extraordinary
and
added
blank
perhaps
flattering
then
do
i
understand
that
you
would
remove
all
wall
papers
a
good
ground
for
distemper
chuckled
blank
but
you
propose
to
inaugurate
a
revolution
i
do
go
so
far
as
that
but
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
introduce
my
ideas
of
house
furnishing
and
house
decoration
to
the
public
said
blank
and
i
may
tell
you
that
when
i
go
to
america
with
my
paris
pictures
i
shall
try
and
decorate
a
house
according
to
my
own
ideas
and
ask
the
americans
to
think
about
the
matter

nothing
matters
but
the
unimportant
so
at
the
risk
of
advertising
an
australian
immigrant
of
fulham
who
like
the
kangaroo
of
his
country
is
born
with
a
pocket
and
puts
everything
into
it
and
in
spite
of
much
wise
advice
we
ought
not
to
resist
the
joy
of
noticing
how
readily
a
hurried
contemporary
has
fallen
a
prey
to
its
superficial
knowledge
of
its
various
departments

culminating
in

special

lengthy

discovered
again
the

foaled

ago

way
so
smart

should
have
printed
its
emotions

the
false

hoisted

all

clearly
the

really
too
old

for

to
be
allowed
to
claim
it
and
as
for
borrowing
whistler

the
only
thoroughly
original

i
have
ever
heard

have
had
reference

it
is

have
to
notice
the
lucubrations

and

original

in

he
certainly
has
for
once
borrowed
from
no
living
author
and
comes
out
in
his
own
true
colours
as
his
own

how
shall
i
stand
against
his
just
anger
and
his
damning
allegations
for
it
must
be
clear
to
your
readers
that
beside
his
clean
polish
as
prettily
set
forth
in
his
epistle
i
alas
am
but
the

ignorant
person
whose
lucubrations
it
is
a
trouble
for
him
to
notice
still
will
i
desperate
as
is
my
condition
point
out
that
though
impertinent
venomous
and
vulgar
he
claims
me
as
his
master
and
in
the
dock
bases
his
innocence
upon
such
relation
between
us
in
all
humility
therefore
i
admit
that
the
outcome
of
my
silly
vanity

incompetent

i

and

me
that

a
matter
of

to
me
if

if

full
of
rash
statement
and
mischievous
doctrine
the
publishers
must
submit
to
the
risk
of
frank
criticism
but
it
will
be
observed
that
whistler
is
merely
seeking
to
create
an
impression
that
your
reviewer
never
saw
the

is
surely

naïvely
that

the
truth
may
justly
be
required
of
the
average
witness
it
can
not
be
expected
it
should
not
be
exacted
of
any
critical
writer
or
lecturer
on
any
form
of
art
and
it
appears
to
one
at
least
of
those
unfortunate

let
us
begin
at
the
end
as
all
reasonable
people
always
do
we
shall
find
that
whistler
concedes
to
greek
art
a
place
beside
japanese
now
this
on
his
own
showing
will
never
do
it
crosses
it
contravenes
it
nullifies
it
pulverizes
his
theory
or
his
principle
of
artistic
limitation
if
japanese
art
is
right
in
confining
itself
to
what
can
be
broidered
upon
the
fan
and
the
gist
of
the
whole
argument
is
in
favour
of
this
assumption
then
the
sculpture
which
appeals
indeed
first
of
all
to
our
perception
of
beauty
to
the
delight
of
the
eye
to
the
wonder
and
the
worship
of
the
instinct
or
the
sense
but
which
in
every
possible
instance
appeals
also
to
far
other
intuitions
and
far
other
sympathies
than
these
is
as
absolutely
wrong
as
demonstrably
inferior
as
any
picture
or
as
any
carving
which
may
be
so
degenerate
and
so
debased
as
to
concern
itself
with
a
story
or
a
subject
assuredly
phidias
thought
of
other
things
than
arrangements
in
marble
as
certainly
as
æschylus

i
am
sorely
afraid
can
the
adored
velasquez
be
promoted
to
a
seat
at
the
foot
of
japanese
art
is
not
merely
the
incomparable
achievement
of
certain
harmonies
in
colour
is
the
negation
the
immolation
the
annihilation
of
everything
by
the
code
which
accepts
as
the
highest
of
models
and
of
masterpieces
the
cups
and
fans
and
screens
with
which
the
poor
world
has
been
as
grievously
pestered
of
late
years
as
ever
it
was
in
shakespeare
time
with
such
waterflies
diminutives
of
nature
as
excited
the
scorn
of
his
moralizing
cynic
velasquez
is
as
unquestionably
condemned
as
is
raphael
or
titian
it
is
true
that
this
miraculous
power
of
hand
makes
beautiful
for
us
the
deformity
of
dwarfs
and
dignifies
the
degradation
of
princes
but
that
is
not
the
question
it
is
true
again
that
whistler
own
merest
arrangements
in
colour
are
lovely
and
effective
but
his
portraits
to
speak
of
these
alone
are
liable
to
the
damning
and
intolerable
imputation
of
possessing
not
merely
other
qualities
than
these
but
qualities
which
actually
appeal
i
blush
to
remember
and
i
shudder
to
record
it
which
actually
appeal
to
the
intelligence
and
the
emotions
to
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
spectator
it
would
be
quite
useless
for
whistler
to
protest
if
haply
he
should
be
so
disposed
that
he
never
meant
to
put
study
of
character
and
revelation
of
intellect
into
his
portrait
of
carlyle
or
intense
pathos
of
significance
and
tender
depth
of
expression
into
the
portrait
of
his
own
venerable
mother
the
scandalous
fact
remains
that
he
has
done
so
and
in
so
doing
has
explicitly
violated
and
implicitly
abjured
the
creed
and
the
canons
the
counsels
and
the
catechism
of

confessedly
does
not

though
most
imprudent

the
saying
of

for
this
art
truth
the
poet
resents
with
the
june
illustration
and
when
whistler
informs
us
that
there
never
was
an
artistic
period
we
must
reply
that
the
statement
so
far
as
it
is
true
is
the
flattest
of
all
possible
truisms
for
no
mortal
ever
maintained
that
there
ever
was
a
period
in
which
all
men
were
either
good
artists
or
good
judges
of
art
but
when
we
pass
from
the
positive
to
the
comparative
degree
of
historic
or
retrospective
criticism
we
must
ask
whether
the
lecturer
means
to
say
that
there
have
not
been
times
when
the
general
standard
of
taste
and
judgment
reason
and
perception
was
so
much
higher
than
at
other
times
and
such
periods
may
justly
and
accurately
be
defined
as
artistic
if
he
does
mean
to
say
this
he
is
beyond
answer
and
beneath
confutation
in
other
words
he
is
where
an
artist
of
whistler
genius
and
a
writer
of
whistler
talents
can
by
no
possibility
find
himself
if
he
does
not
mean
to
say
this
what
he
means
to
say
is
exactly
as
well
worth
saying
as
valuable
and
as
important
a
piece
of
information
as
the
news
that
queen
anne

no
more

that

but
if
the
light
and
glittering
bark
of
this
brilliant
amateur
in
the
art
of
letters
is
not
invariably
steered
with
equal
dexterity
of
hand
between
the
scylla
and
charybdis
of
paradox
and
platitude
it
is
impossible
that
in
its
course
it
should
not
once
and
again
touch
upon
some
point
worth
notice
if
not
exploration
even
that
miserable
animal
the
unattached
writer
may
gratefully
and
respectfully
recognize
his
accurate
apprehension
and
his
felicitous
application
of
the
most
hackneyed
verse
in
all
the
range
of
shakespeare
which
yet
is
almost
invariably
misconstrued
and
misapplied
one
touch
of
nature
makes
the
whole
world
kin
and
this
as
the
poet
goes
on
to
explain
is
that
all
with
one
consent
prefer
worthless
but
showy
novelties
to
precious
but
familiar
possessions
this
one
chord
that
vibrates
with
all
says
whistler
who
proceeds
to
cite
artistic
examples
of
the
lamentable
fact
this
one
unspoken
sympathy
that
pervades
humanity
is
vulgarity
but
the
consequence
which
he
proceeds
to
indicate
and
to
deplore
is
calculated
to
strike
his
readers
with
a
sense
of
mild
if
hilarious
astonishment
it
is
that
men
of
sound
judgment
and
pure
taste
quick
feelings
and
clear
perceptions
most
unfortunately
and
most
inexplicably
begin
to
make
their

of
the
germans
of
his
day
that
in
greek
they
were
sadly
to
seek
it
is
no
discredit
to
whistler
if
this
is
his
case
also
but
then
he
would
do
well
to
eschew
the
use
of
a
greek
term
lying
so
far
out
of
the
common
way
as
the
word
æsthete
not
merely
the
only
accurate
meaning
but
the
only
possible
meaning
of
that
word
is
nothing
more
but
nothing
less
than
this

intelligent
appreciative
person
in
a
word

the

has
it

who
perceives

by
the
logic
of

the
necessity
of
the
case

a
tasteless
senseless
and
impenetrable
blockhead
i
do
not
wish
to
insult
whistler

i
feel
bound
to
avow
my
impression
that
there
is
no
man
now
living

fangless

it
is
in
higher
and
graver
matters
of
wider
bearing
and
of
deeper
import
that
we
find
it
necessary
to
dispute
the
apparently
serious
propositions
or
assertions
of
whistler

the
witty
tongue
may
be
thrust
into
the
smiling
when
the
lecturer
pauses
to
take
breath
between
these
remarkably
brief
paragraphs
it
would
be
certainly
indecorous
and
possibly
superfluous
to
inquire
but
his
theorem
is
unquestionably
calculated
to
provoke
the
loudest
and
the
heartiest

imagine
that
he
really

the
highest
expression

and
glare
the
smirk
and
leer
of
japanese
womanhood
as
represented
in
its
professional
types

but
to
all
appearance
he
would
fain

i

this
however
is
an

may
be
alleged

proves

i
have
only
to
answer
that
it

so

that
the

if
the
better
part
of
work
as

is
to
be
accepted
as
the
work
of

creature
it
would
seem
incongruous
and
preposterous
to
dismiss
the
more
characteristic
points
of
his
theory
as
a
lecturer
with
the
chuckle
or
the
shrug
of
mere
amusement
or
amazement
moreover
if
considered
as
a

a
mere

and
nothing
but
a

this
gospel

hardly

to

so

of

therefore
as
something

in
the
main
and
if
so
taken
and
read
by
the
light
reflected
from
whistler
more
characteristically
brilliant
canvases
it
may
not
improbably
recall
a
certain
phrase
of
molière
which
at
once
passed
into
a
proverb

that
worthy
tradesman
it
will
be
remembered
was
of
opinion
that
nothing
could
be
so
well
calculated
to
restore
a
drooping
young
lady
to
mental
and
physical
health
as

the
correspondent
saw
whistler
at
the
hôtel
suisse
and
asked
the
artist
about
his
affairs
with
the
american
art
jury
of
the
exhibition
i
believe
the
made
the
statement
said
whistler
that
i
had
withdrawn
all
my
etchings
and
a
portrait
from
the
american
section
it
all
came
about
in
this
way
in
the
first
place
before
the
pictures
were
sent
in
i
received
a
note
from
the
american
art
department
asking
me
to
contribute
some
of
my
work
it
was
at
that
time
difficult
for
me
to
collect
many
of
my
works
but
i
borrowed
what
i
could
from
different
people
and
sent
in
etchings
and
the
portrait
you
can
imagine
that
a
few
etchings
do
not
have
any
effect
at
all
so
i
sent
what
i
could
get
together
shortly
afterwards
i
received
a
note
saying
ten
of
your
exhibits
have
not
received
the
approval
of
the
jury
will
you
kindly
remove
them
at
the
bottom
of
this
note
was
the
name
general
hawkins
i
believe
a
cavalry
officer
who
had
charge
of
the
american
art
department
of
the
exhibition
well
the
next
day
i
went
to
paris
and
called
at
the
american
headquarters
of
the
exhibition
i
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
this
gentleman
hawkins
to
whom
i
said
am
whistler
and
i
believe
this
note
is
from
you
i
have
come
to
remove
my
etchings
but
i
did
not
mention
that
my
work
was
to
be
transferred
to
the
english
art
section
said
the
gentleman
the
officer
were
very
sorry
not
to
have
had
space
enough
for
all
your
etchings
but
we
are
glad
to
have
seventeen
and
the
portrait
are
too
kind
i
said
really
i
will
not
trouble
you
hawkins
was
quite
embarrassed
and
urged
me
to
reconsider
my
determination
but
i
withdrew
every
one
of
the
etchings
and
they
are
now
well
hung
in
the
english
department
i
did
not
mind
the
fact
that
my
works
were
criticized
but
it
was
the
discourteous
manner
in
which
it
was
done
if
the
request
to
me
had
been
made
in
proper
language
and
they
had
simply
said
whistler
we
have
not
space
enough
for
etchings
will
you
kindly
select
those
which
you
prefer
and
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
them
i
would
have
given
them
the
privilege
of
placing
them
in
the
american
sidenote
york
paris
edition
in
an
interview
in
yesterday
the
eccentric
artist
mcneill
whistler
jumped
in
a
most
emphatic
manner
upon
general
hawkins
commissioner
of
the
american
art
department
at
the
exhibition
he
objects
to
the
general
for
being
a
cavalry
officer
refers
to
him
sarcastically
as
hawkins
and
declares
him
ignorant
of
the
most
elementary
principles
alike
of
art
and
politeness
all
this
because
he
whistler
was
requested
by
the
commissioner
to
remove
from
the
exhibition
premises
some
ten
of
his
rejected
etchings
in
a
spirit
of
fair
play
a
correspondent
called
upon
general
hawkins
giving
him
an
opportunity
if
he
felt
so
disposed
of
jumping
in
his
turn
on
his
excitable
opponent
the
general
did
feel
so
disposed
and
proceeded
in
popular
parlance
to
see
mcneill
whistler
and
go
him
one
better
in
this
species
of
linguistic
gymnastics
by
the
way
the
military
commissioner
asks
no
odds
of
any
one
he
began
by
gently
remarking
that
whistler
in
his
published
remarks
had
soared
far
out
of
the
domain
of
strict
veracity
this
was
not
bad
for
a
starter
and
was
ably
supported
by
the
following
detailed
statement
whistler
says
he
received
a
note
from
me
that
is
a
mistake
i
have
never
in
my
life
written
a
line
to
mr
whistler
what
he
did
receive
was
a
circular
with
my
name
printed
at
the
bottom
these
circulars
were
sent
to
all
the
artists
who
had
pictures
refused
by
the
jury
and
contained
a
simple
request
that
such
pictures
be
removed
note
the
official
memory
dear
sir
i
wish
by
return
mail
you
would
send
description
for
oils
and
if
you
desire
to
have
titles
to
etchings
printed
you
will
have
to
furnish
the
necessary
material
for
yours
faithfully
rush
hawkins
commissariat
general
paris
march
to
mr
whistler
our
way
of
doing
business
was
not
it
seems
up
to
standard
of
politeness
so
he
got
angry
and
took
away
not
only
the
ten
rejected
etchings
but
seventeen
others
which
had
been
accepted
it
is
a
little
singular
that
among
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
artists
who
received
this
circular
whistler
should
have
been
the
only
one
to
discover
its
latent
discourtesy
how
great
must
be
capacity
for
detecting
a
snub
where
none
exists
in
any
case
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
for
venting
his
ire
upon
me
i
had
no
more
to
do
with
either
accepting
or
rejecting
his
pictures
than
i
had
with
painting
them
what
he
sent
us
was
judged
on
its
merits
by
a
competent
and
impartial
jury
of
his
peers
if
there
were
ten
etchings
rejected
it
only
shows
that
there
were
ten
etchings
not
worthy
of
acceptance
a
few
days
after
the
affair
a
trio
of
journalists
not
all
men
either
came
to
me
demanding
that
i
reverse
this
decision
as
they
styled
it
i
told
these
three
prying
scribblers
in
a
polite
way
that
if
they
would
kindly
attend
to
their
own
affairs
i
would
try
to
attend
to
mine
in
this
connection
i
may
remark
that
there
are
in
paris
a
number
of
correspondents
who
ought
not
to
be
allowed
within
of
a
newspaper
office
the
next
in
whistler
interview
is
in
regard
to
the
ultimate
disposal
of
his
important
etchings
his
words
are
hawkins
was
quite
embarrassed
and
urged
me
to
reconsider
my
determination
but
i
withdrew
every
one
of
the
etchings
and
they
are
now
well
hung
in
the
english
department
now
i
leave
it
to
any
person
if
the
plain
inference
from
this
statement
is
not
that
the
whole
etchings
were
accepted
by
the
english
department
if
not
what
in
heaven
name
is
he
crowing
about
but
the
truth
is
that
while
we
rejected
only
of
his
etchings
the
english
department
rejected
of
them
and
of
the
nine
accepted
only
hung
two
on
the
line
had
whistler
been
the
possessor
of
a
more
even
temper
and
a
little
more
common
sense
he
would
have
had
five
or
six
of
his
works
on
the
line
in
the
american
department
and
nearly
twice
as
many
on
exhibition
than
is
actually
the
case
really
i
fail
to
see
what
he
gained
by
the
exchange
unless
it
was
a
valuable
experience
he
says
i
was
embarrassed
when
i
saw
him
i
fancy
he
will
be
embarrassed
when
he
sees
these
facts
in
type
the
editor
sidenote
york
sir
i
beg
that
you
will
kindly
print
immediately
these
my
regrets
that
general
rush
hawkins
should
have
been
spurred
into
unwonted
and
unbecoming
expression
by
what
i
myself
read
with
considerable
bewilderment
in
the
york
october
under
the
head
of
whistler
grievance
i
can
assure
the
gallant
soldier
that
i
have
no
grievance
had
i
known
that
when
over
what
takes
the
place
of
wine
and
walnuts
in
holland
i
remembered
lightly
the
military
methods
of
the
jury
i
was
being
interviewed
i
should
have
adopted
as
serious
a
tone
as
the
original
farce
would
admit
of
or
i
might
have
even
refused
to
be
a
party
at
all
to
the
infliction
upon
your
readers
of
so
old
and
threadbare
a
story
as
that
of
the
raid
upon
the
works
of
art
in
the
american
section
of
the
universal
exhibition
your
correspondent
i
fancy
felt
much
more
warmly
than
did
i
wrongs
that
who
knows
are
doubtless
rights
in
the
army
and
my
sympathies
i
confess
are
completely
with
the
general
who
did
only
as
he
complains
his
duty
in
that
state
of
life
in
which
it
had
pleased
god
and
the
war
department
to
call
him
when
according
to
order
he
signed
that
naïvely
authoritative
note
circular
warrant
or
what
not
for
he
did
irretrievably
fasten
his
name
to
it
whether
with
pen
or
print
thereby
hopelessly
making
the
letter
his
own
thus
have
we
responsibility
like
greatness
sometimes
thrust
upon
us
on
receipt
of
the
document
i
came
i
saw
the
commanding
officer
who
until
now
i
fondly
trusted
would
ever
remember
me
as
pleasantly
as
i
do
himself
and
knowing
despatch
in
all
military
matters
to
be
of
great
importance
i
then
and
there
relieved
him
of
the
troublesome
etchings
and
carried
off
the
painting
it
is
a
sad
shock
to
me
to
find
that
the
good
general
speaks
of
me
without
affection
and
that
he
evinces
even
joy
when
he
says
with
a
view
to
my
entire
discomfiture
while
we
rejected
only
ten
of
his
etchings
the
english
department
rejected
eighteen
of
them
and
of
the
nine
accepted
only
hung
two
on
the
line
now
he
is
wrong
the
general
is
wrong
the
etchings
now
hanging
in
the
english
section
and
perfect
is
their
hanging
notwithstanding
general
hawkins
flattering
anxiety
are
the
only
ones
i
sent
there
in
the
haste
and
enthusiasm
of
your
interviewer
i
have
on
this
point
been
misunderstood
there
was
moreover
here
no
question
of
submitting
them
to
a
competent
and
impartial
jury
of
his
peers
one
of
whom
by
the
way
i
am
informed
upon
undoubted
authority
had
never
before
come
upon
an
etching
in
his
hitherto
happy
and
unchequered
western
career
we
all
knew
that
the
space
allotted
to
the
english
department
was
exceedingly
limited
and
each
one
refrained
from
abusing
it
here
i
would
point
out
again
hoping
this
time
to
be
clearly
understood
that
had
the
methods
employed
in
the
american
camp
been
more
civil
if
less
military
all
further
difficulties
might
have
been
avoided
had
i
been
properly
advised
that
the
room
was
less
than
the
demand
for
place
i
would
of
course
have
instantly
begged
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
to
choose
from
among
the
number
what
etchings
they
pleased
so
the
matter
would
have
ended
and
you
sir

whistler
has
many
things
to
answer
for
and
not
the
least
of
them
is
the
education
of
the
british
that
at
any
rate
is
the
impression
left
by
a
little
book
made
up
apparently
against
the
writer
will
of
certain
of
the
master
letters
and
it
is
useful
and
pleasant
reading
for
not
only
does
it
prove
the
painter
to
have
a
certain
literary
talent
of
aptness
unexpectedness
above
all
impertinence
but
also
it
proves
him
never
to
have
feared
the
face
of
man
to
him
the
is
nothing
if
not
a
person
to
be
educated
with
or
against
the
grain
and
when
he
encounters
him
in
the
ways
of
error
he
leaps
upon
him
joyously
scalps
him
in

before
the
eyes
of
men
kicks
him
gaily
back
into
the
paths
of
truth
and
soberness

resumes
his
avocation

that
peculiar
zest
an
act
of

does
undoubtedly
impart

the

was
not

was
in

was

we
were
having
now
so
far
from

showing
it

they
distinctly
spoke

no

from
its
the
only
inference
possible
is
either
that
whistler
is
not
a
master
or
that
the
work
is
finished
he
has
however
spent
what
time
he
could
spare
from
his

labours

to
induce
the

believe
that

scratch
from

so
disturbed
all

desist
he
continued
his

for

ended

what
appeared
to
his

that

you
may
see
by
referring
to
any
dictionary
said
the
neighbours
do
think
that
symphony
is
the
word
to
describe
your
performance
cacophony
would
be
more
correct
and
that
means
a
bad
set
of
sounds
absurdly
you
talk
said
the
donkey
will
refer
it
to

and
let
them
decide

decided
that
the

song
was
a
most
symphonious

harmonious

he
continues

bray

melodiously
as

so
in
the
successive
whistlers
put
before
the
public
during
that
time
first
of
all
we
remember
pictures
of
ladies
pale
and
attenuate
poring
with
tender
interest
over
vermilion
scarfs
the
taint
of
realism
was
on
them
but
even
in
them
were
hints
of
the
pensive
humour
that
was
to
fetch
mankind
in
the
at
a
later
time
a
good
deal
was
left
to
the
spectator
imagination
even
in
them
we
note
his
predilections
for
dinginess
and
dirt
arrangement

all
these
pictures
strike
us
alike
they
seem
like
ghosts
at
a
spiritualistic
i
can
not
help
wondering
when
they
will
gain
substance
and
appear
more
clearly
out
of
their
environing
fog
or
when
they
will
melt
altogether
from
my
attentive
gaze
he
has
placed
one
of
his
portraits
on
an
asphalte
floor
and
against
a
background
the
whole
apparently
representing
a
dressy
woman
in
an
of
the
worldly
whistler
has
a
capricious
rendering
of
a
lady
dressed
in
black
in
a
black
recess
on
a
dark
green
floor
she
is
turning
affectedly
towards
the
spectator
as
she

the
corporation
of
the
purpose
of
this
picture
is
a
form
of
which
would
certainly
not
have
received
the
approbation
of
carlyle
this
very
doubtful
masterpiece
unhappy
ratepayers
of
glasgow
and
to
have
recorded
on
a
doleful
canvas
the
head
and
figure
of
carlyle
the
rugged
simplicity
of
carlyle
to
have
painted
these
things
alone
however
strange
their
mannerism
or
incomplete
their
technique
the
portentous
purchase
by
the
civic
authorities
of
senile
carlyle
renders
it
necessary
for
that
section
of
the
community
who
are
not
enamoured
of
impressionism
to
watch
with
some
vigilance
the
next
steps
taken
by
that
body
towards
the
formation
of
the
permanent
collection
a
portrait
which
omits
entirely
to
bring
out
the
individuality
of
the

little
chance
of
recognition

immediate
posterity

we
can
not
forget
his
encounter
some
years
ago
with
ruskin
nor
the
contemptuous
terms
in
which
that
foremost
of
art
critics
denounced
his
work
it
has
been
left
to
glasgow
to
rectify
ruskin
blunder
in
this
matter
and
it
vindicates
the
merits
of
the
american
artist
over
whose
artistic
vagaries
his
nocturnes
and
harmonies
in
blue
and
gold
the
press

writers

it
is
a
picture

story
is
complete
whose
honours
have
been
gathered
abroad
in
paris
in
brussels
in
munich
its
destiny
has
been
accomplished
it
belongs
to
the
city
of
glasgow
and
from
the
corporation
of
that
city
was
borrowed
for
the
victorian
exhibition
the
corporation
lent
it
in
good
faith
the
borrowers
have
treated
it
with
all
the
indignity
it
is
in
their
power
to
bestow
on
it
could
there
be
a
better
epitome
of
the
recent
history
of
art
in
england
one
work
of
whistler
is
received
with
high
honour
in
the
luxembourg
on
its
way
to
the
louvre
and
at
that
very
moment
another
work
of
his
worthy
to
rank
with
the
first
is
hoist
with
equally
high
disrespect
to
the
ceiling
of
a
gallery

which
it
was
not
so
much
the

as
the
figure
and
the
movement
that
came
to
be
deftly
suggested
if
hardly
elaborately
all
whistler
work
is
unfinished
it
is
sketchy
he
no
doubt
possesses
artistic
qualities
and
he
has
got
appreciation
of
qualities
of
tone
but
he
is
not
complete
and
all
his
works
are
in
the
nature
of
sketching

arrangement
in
grey

portrait
of
the
painter
mother
of
this
canvas
is
large
and
much
of
it
vacant
a
dim
cold
light
fills
the
room
where
the
flat
grey
wall
is
only
broken
by
a
solitary
picture
in
black
and
white
a
piece
of
foldless
creaseless
oriental
flowered
crape
hangs
from
the
cornice
and
here
in
this
solemn
chamber
sits
the
lady
in

garb
the
picture
has
found
few
admirers
among
the
thousands
who
seek
to
while
away
the
hours
at
burlington
house
and
for
this
result
the
painter
has
only
to
thank
himself
in
grey
and
black
portrait
of
the
painter
mother
is
another
of
whistler
experiments
it
is
not
a
picture
and
we
fail
to
discover
any
that
the
artist
can
have
in
view
in
restricting
himself
almost
entirely
to
black
and
grey
the
is
stiff
and
ugly
enough
to
repel
many
before
such
pictures
as
the
portraits
by
whistler
critic
and
spectator
are
alike
puzzled
criticism
and
admiration
seem
alike
impossible
and
the
mind
vacillates
between
a
feeling
that
the
artist
is
playing
a
practical
joke
upon
the
spectator
or
that
the
painter
is
suffering
from
some
peculiar
optical
delusion
after
all
there
are
certain
accepted
canons
about
what
constitutes
good
drawing
good
colour
and
good
painting
and
when
an
artist
deliberately
sets
himself
to
ignore
or
violate
all
of
these
it
is
desirable
that
his
work
should
not
be
classed
with
that
of
ordinary
artists
he
that
telleth
a
tale
to
carlyle
majority
speaketh
to
one
in
a
slumber
when
he
hath
told
his
tale
he
will
say
what
is
the
matter
illustration
it
is
impossible
to
take
whistler
seriously
a
combination
of
circumstances
has
within
the
last
year
or
two
brought
the
name
and
work
of
whistler
into
special
publicity
at
the
grosvenor
gallery
the
less
desirable
of
his
designs
aroused
the
inconsiderate
ire
of
a
man
of
genius
and
splendid
authority
if
it
be
whistler
theory
that
that
which
all
the
world
of
greatest
artists
has
mistaken
for
mere
means
has
been
in
very
seriousness
the
end
then
the
aim
of
art
is
immeasurably
lowered
if
there
be
anything
to
the
point
it
is
to
implore
us
to
take
a
stone
for
bread
and
the
grammar
of
a
language
in
place
of
its
literature
whistler
has
assumed
that
it
is
only
the
painter
who
is
occupied
with
art
unless
he
is
a
very
exceptional
man
if
he
is
not
of
the
school
of
fulham
he
is
of
the
school
of

he
like
ruskin

thirty
years
of

young
days
in
which

took
the
duty

on
to
his
old
age
was
contradicted
by
whistler
pictures
in
painting
his
success
is
infrequent
and
it
is
limited
in
painting
whistler
is
an
impressionist
his
best
painting
betrays
something
of
that
almost
modern
sensitiveness
to
pleasurable
juxtapositions
of
delicate
colour
which
we
admire
in
orchardson
in
linton
and
in
albert
moore
it
betrays
sometimes
as
in
a
portrait
of
miss
alexander
a
deftness
of
brushwork
in
the
wave
of
a
feather
in
the
curve
of
a
hat
and
of
high
art
qualities
it
betrays
not
much
besides
it
is
true
that
the
originality
of
his
painted
work
is
somewhat
apt
to
be
dependent
on
the
innocent
error
that
confuses
the
beginning
with
the
end
accepts
the
intention
for
the
execution
and
exalts
