to

of

landor
i
now
dedicate
with
equal
affection
reverence
and
regret
a
poem
inscribed
to
him
while
yet
alive
in
words
which
are
now
retained
because
they
were
laid
before
him
and
to
which
rather
than
cancel
them
i
have
added
such
others
as
were
evoked
by
the
news
of
his
death
that
though
losing
the
pleasure
i
may
not
lose
the
honour
of
inscribing
in
front
of
my

the

the

althaea
daughter
of
thestius
and
eurythemis
queen
of
calydon
being
with
child
of
meleager
her
son
dreamed
that
she
brought
forth
a
brand
burning
and
upon
his
birth
came
the
three
fates
and
prophesied
of
him
three
things
namely
these
that
he
should
have
great
strength
of
his
hands
and
good
fortune
in
this
life
and
that
he
should
live
no
longer
when
the
brand
then
in
the
fire
were
consumed
wherefore
his
mother
plucked
it
forth
and
kept
it
by
her
and
the
child
being
a
man
grown
sailed
with
jason
after
the
fleece
of
gold
and
won
himself
great
praise
of
all
men
living
and
when
the
tribes
of
the
north
and
west
made
war
upon
aetolia
he
fought
against
their
army
and
scattered
it
but
artemis
having
at
the
first
stirred
up
these
tribes
to
war
against
oeneus
king
of
calydon
because
he
had
offered
sacrifice
to
all
the
gods
saving
her
alone
but
her
he
had
forgotten
to
honour
was
yet
more
wroth
because
of
the
destruction
of
this
army
and
sent
upon
the
land
of
calydon
a
wild
boar
which
slew
many
and
wasted
all
their
increase
but
him
could
none
slay
and
many
went
against
him
and
perished
then
were
all
the
chief
men
of
greece
gathered
together
and
among
them
atalanta
daughter
of
iasius
the
arcadian
a
virgin
for
whose
sake
artemis
let
slay
the
boar
seeing
she
favoured
the
maiden
greatly
and
meleager
having
despatched
it
gave
the
spoil
thereof
to
atalanta
as
one
beyond
measure
enamoured
of
her
but
the
brethren
of
althaea
his
mother
toxeus
and
plexippus
with
such
others
as
misliked
that
she
only
should
bear
off
the
praise
whereas
many
had
borne
the
labour
laid
wait
for
her
to
take
away
her
spoil
but
meleager
fought
against
them
and
slew
them
whom
when
althaea
their
sister
beheld
and
knew
to
be
slain
of
her
son
she
waxed
for
wrath
and
sorrow
like
as
one
mad
and
taking
the
brand
whereby
the
measure
of
her
son
life
was
meted
to
him
she
cast
it
upon
a
fire
and
with
the
wasting
thereof
his
life
likewise
wasted
away
that
being
brought
back
to
his
house
he
died
in
a
brief
space
and
his
mother
also
endured
not
long
after
for
very
sorrow
and
this
was
his
end
and
the
end
of
that
hunting
atalanta

are
these

when
the
king
did
sacrifice

god
fair
dues
of
wheat

blood

wine
her
not
with
bloodshed
nor
revered
he
nor
with
salt

being
wroth
she
plagued
the
land

now
takes
off
from
us
fate

her
heavy
things

deed
of
these
twain
were
not

a
just

mercy
is
no

althaea
yea
but
a
curse
she
hath
sent
above
all
these
to
hurt
us
where
she
healed
us
and
hath
lit
fire
where
the
old
fire
went
out

where
the
wind
slackened
hath
blown
on
us
with
deadlier
air
chorus
what
storm
is
this
that
tightens
all
our
sail
althaea
love
a
thwart
full
of
rain

foam

whence
blown

born
under
what
stormier
star
althaea
southward
across
euenus
from
the

chorus
thy
speech
turns
toward
arcadia

blown

sharp

the
north
sets

the
snows
are
out
chorus
nay
for
this
maiden
hath
no
touch
of
love
althaea
i
would
she
had
sought
in
some
cold
gulf
of
sea
love
or
in
dens
where
strange
beasts
lurk
or
fire
or
snows
on
the
extreme
hills
or
iron
land
where
no
spring
is

would
she

ever
love
had
found
her
here
chorus
she
is
holier
than
all
holy
days
or
things
the
sprinkled
water
or
fume
of
perfect
fire
chaste
dedicated
to
pure
prayers
and
filled
with
higher
thoughts
than
heaven
a
maiden
clean
pure
iron
fashioned
for
a
sword
and
man
she
loves
not
what
should
one
such
do
with
love
althaea
look
you
i
speak
not
as
one
light
of
wit
but
as
a
queen
speaks
being
for
oft
i
hear
my
brothers
wrangling
in
mid
hall
and
am
not
moved
and
my
son
chiding
them
and
these
things
nowise
move
me
but
i
know
foolish
and
wise
men
must
be
to
the
end
and
feed
myself
with
patience
but
this
most
this
moves
me
that
for
wise
men
as
for
fools
love
is
one
thing
an
evil
thing
and
turns
choice
words
and
wisdom
into
fire
and
air
and
in
the
end
shall
no
joy
come
but
grief
sharp
words
and
soul
division
and
fresh
tears
upon
the
old
root
of
tears
brought
forth
upon
the
old
flower
of
tears
sprung
up
pitiful
sighs
and
much
regrafted
pain
these
things
are
in
my
presage
and
myself
am
part
of
them
and
know
not
but
in
dreams
the
gods
are
heavy
on
me
and
all
the
fates
shed
fire
across
my
eyelids
mixed
with
night
and
burn
me
blind
and
disilluminate
my
sense
of
seeing
and
my
perspicuous
soul
darken
with
vision
seeing
i
see
not
hear
and
hearing
am
not
holpen
but
mine
eyes
stain
many
tender
broideries
in
the
bed
drawn
up
about
my
face
that
i
may
weep
and
the
king
wake
not
and
my
brows
and
lips
tremble
and
sob
in
sleeping
like
swift
flames
that
tremble
or
water
when
it
sobs
with
heat
kindled
from
under
and
my
tears
fill
my
breast
and
speck
the
fair
dyed
pillows
round
the
king
with
barren
showers
and
salter
than
the
sea
such
dreams
divide
me
dreaming
for
long
since
i
dreamed
that
out
of
this
my
womb
had
sprung
fire
and
a
firebrand
this
was
ere
my
son
meleager
a
goodly
flower
in
fields
of
fight
felt
the
light
touch
him
coming
forth
and
waited
childlike
but
yet
he
was
not
and
in
time
i
bare
him
and
my
heart
was
great
for
yet
so
royally
was
never
strong
man
born
nor
queen
so
nobly
bore
as
noble
a
thing
as
this
my
son
was
such
a
birth
god
sent
and
such
a
grace
to
bear
it
then
came
in
three
weaving
women
and
span
each
a
thread
saying
this
for
strength
and
that
for
luck
and
one
saying
till
the
brand
upon
the
hearth
burn
down
so
long
shall
this
man
see
good
days
and
live
and
i
with
gathered
raiment
from
the
bed
sprang
and
drew
forth
the
brand
and
cast
on
it
water
and
trod
the
flame
and
crushed
with
naked
hand
spark
beaten
out
of
spark
and
blew
against
and
quenched
it
for
i
said
these
are
the
most
high
fates
that
dwell
with
us
and
we
find
favour
a
little
in
their
sight
a
little
and
more
we
miss
of
and
much
time
foils
us
howbeit
they
have
pitied
me
o
son
and
thee
most
piteous
thee
a
tenderer
thing
than
any
flower
of
fleshly
seed
alive
wherefore
i
kissed
and
hid
him
with
my
hands
and
covered
under
arms
and
hair
and
wept
and
feared
to
touch
him
with
my
tears
and
laughed
so
light
a
thing
was
this
man
grown
so
great
men
cast
their
heads
back
seeing
against
the
sun
blaze
the
armed
man
carven
on
his
shield
and
hear
the
laughter
of
little
bells
along
the
brace
ring
as
birds
singing
or
flutes
blown
and
watch
high
up
the
cloven
shadow
of
either
plume
divide
the
bright
light
of
the
brass
and
make
his
helmet
as
a
windy
and
wintering
moon
seen
through
blown
cloud
and
drift
when
ships
drive
and
men
strive
with
all
the
sea
and
oars
break
and
the
beaks
dip
under
drinking
death
yet
was
he
then
but
a
span
long
and
moaned
with
inarticulate
mouth
inseparate
words
and
with
blind
lips
and
fingers
wrung
my
breast
hard
and
thrust
out
with
foolish
hands
and
feet
murmuring
but
those
grey
women
with
bound
hair
who
fright
the
gods
frighted
not
him
he
laughed
seeing
them
and
pushed
out
hands
to
feel
and
haul
distaff
and
thread
intangible
but
they
passed
and
i
hid
the
brand
and
in
my
heart
laughed
likewise
having
all
my
will
of
heaven
but
now
i
know
not
if
to
left
or
right
the
gods
have
drawn
us
hither
for
again
i
dreamt
and
saw
the
black
brand
burst
on
fire
as
a
branch
bursts
in
flower
and
saw
the
flame
fade
and
death
came
and
with
dry
lips
blew
the
charred
ash
into
my
breast
and
love
trampled
the
ember
and
crushed
it
with
swift
feet
this
i
have
also
at
heart
that
not
for
me
not
for
me
only
or
son
of
mine
o
girls
the
gods
have
wrought
life
and
desire
of
life
heart
love
and
heart
division
but
for
all
there
shines
one
sun
and
one
wind
blows
till
night
and
when
night
comes
the
wind
sinks
and
the
sun
and
there
is
no
light
after
and
no
storm
but
sleep
and
much
forgetfulness
of
things
in
such
wise
i
gat
knowledge
of
the
gods
years
hence
and
heard
high
sayings
of
one
most
wise
eurythemis
my
mother
who
beheld
with
eyes
alive
and
spake
with
lips
of
these
as
one
on
earth
disfleshed
and
disallied
from
breath
or
blood
corruptible
such
gifts
time
gave
her
and
an
equal
soul
to
these
and
equal
face
to
all
things
thus
she
said
but
whatsoever
intolerable
or
glad
the
swift
hours
weave
and
unweave
i
go
hence
full
of
mine
own
soul
perfect
of
myself
toward
mine
and
me
sufficient
and
what
chance
the
gods
cast
lots
for
and
shake
out
on
us
that
shall
we
take
and
that
much
bear
withal
and
now
before
these
gather
to
the
hunt
i
will
go
arm
my
son
and
bring
him
forth
lest
love
or
some
man
anger
work
him
harm

the
sweet

death
of
old
men
honourable
who
have
lived
out
all
the
length
of
all
their
years
blameless
and
seen
the
face
of
gods
and
without
shame
and
without
fear
have
wrought
things
memorable
and
while
their
days
held
out
in

of
all
men
and
the

great

have
gat
them
glory
and
given
of
their

to
the

that

and
the

that
bred

and
filled

lands
loved

or
washed
by
violent

towns
populous
and

when
white
age
and
venerable
death
mow
down
the

and

within
their

drain
out
the

immortal

on

through
splendid

and
death
desirable
to
the
clear

remote
throne
of
souls
lands
indiscoverable
in
the
west
round
which
the
strong
stream
of
a
sacred
sea
rolls
without

for
ever
and

snow
there
shows
not
her
white
wings
and

feet
nor
thunder
nor

rain
saith
anything
nor

but
all

and
these
filled
full
of

divine
and

and

a

nearer
than
their

of

love
thou
such

and
look
for
such
a
death
but
from
the
light
and
fiery
dreams
of
love
spring
heavy
sorrows
and
a
sleepless
life
visions
not
dreams
whose
lids
no
charm
shall
close
nor

assuage
them
waking
and
swift
death
crushes
with
sterile
feet
the
unripening
ear
treads
out
the
timeless
vintage
whom
do
thou
eschewing
embrace
the
luck
of
this
thy
life
not
without
honour
and
it
shall
bear
to
thee
such
fruit
as
men
reap
from
spent
hours
and
wear
few
men
but
happy
of
whom
be
thou
o
son
happiest
if
thou
submit
thy
soul
to
fate
and
set
thine
eyes
and
heart
on
hopes
and
divine
deeds
and
abstinence
divine
so
shalt
thou
be
toward
all
men
all
thy
days
as
light
and
might
communicable
and
burn
from
heaven
among
the
stars
above
the
hours
and
break
not
as
a
man
breaks
nor
burn
down
for
to
whom
other
of
all
heroic
names
have
the
gods
given
his
life
in
hand
as
thine
and
gloriously
hast
thou
lived
and
made
thy
life
to
me
that
bare
thee
and
to
all
men
born
thankworthy
a
praise
for
ever
and
hast
won
fame
when
wild
wars
broke
all
round
thy
father
house
and
the
mad
people
of
windy
mountain
ways
laid
spears
against
us
like
a
sea
and
all
aetolia
thundered
with
thessalian
hoofs
yet
these
as
wind
baffles
the
foam
and
beats
straight
back
the
relaxed
ripple
didst
thou
break
and
loosen
all
their
lances
till
undone
and
man
from
man
they
fell
for
ye
twain
stood
god
against
god
ares
and
artemis
and
thou
the
mightier
wherefore
she
unleashed
a
curse
thou
too
shalt
overcome
for
in
the
greener
blossom
of
thy
life
ere
the
full
blade
caught
flower
and
when
time
gave
respite
thou
didst
not
slacken
soul
nor
sleep
but
with
great
hand
and
heart
seek
praise
of
men
out
of
sharp
straits
and
many
a
grievous
thing
seeing
the
strange
foam
of
undivided
seas
on
channels
never
sailed
in
and
by
shores
where
the
old
winds
cease
not
blowing
and
all
the
night
thunders
and
day
is
no
delight
to
men
chorus
meleager
a
noble
wisdom
and
fair
words
the
gods
have
given
this
woman
hear
thou
these
meleager
o
mother
i
am
not
fain
to
strive
in
speech
nor
set
my
mouth
against
thee
who
art
wise
even
as
they
say
and
full
of
sacred
words
but
one
thing
i
know
surely
and
cleave
to
this
that
though
i
be
not
subtle
of
wit
as
thou
nor
womanlike
to
weave
sweet
words
and
melt
mutable
minds
of
wise
men
as
with
fire
i
too
doing
justly
and
reverencing
the
gods
shall
not
want
wit
to
see
what
things
be
right
for
whom
they
love
and
whom
reject
being
gods
there
is
no
man
but
seeth
and
in
good
time
submits
himself
refraining
all
his
heart
and
i
too
as
thou
sayest
have
seen
great
things
seen
otherwhere
but
chiefly
when
the
sail
first
caught
between
stretched
ropes
the
roaring
west
and
all
our
oars
smote
eastward
and
the
wind
first
flung
round
faces
of
seafaring
men
white
splendid
of
the
sundering
foam
and
the
first
furrow
in
virginal
green
sea
followed
the
plunging
ploughshare
of
hewn
pine
and
closed
as
when
deep
sleep
subdues
man
breath
lips
close
and
heart
subsides
and
closing
shone
sunlike
with
many
a
nereid
hair
and
moved
round
many
a
trembling
mouth
of
doubtful
gods
risen
out
of
sunless
and
sonorous
gulfs
through
waning
water
and
into
shallow
light
that
watched
us
and
when
flying
the
dove
was
snared
as
with
men
hands
but
we
shot
after
and
sped
clear
through
the
irremeable
symplegades
and
chiefliest
when
hoar
beach
and
herbless
cliff
stood
out
ahead
from
colchis
and
we
heard
clefts
hoarse
with
wind
and
saw
through
narrowing
reefs
the
lightning
of
the
intolerable
wave
flash
and
the
white
wet
flame
of
breakers
burn
far
under
a
kindling
as
a
lamp
burns
and
bends
all
its
blowing
flame
one
way
wild
heights
untravelled
of
the
wind
and
vales
cloven
seaward
by
their
violent
streams
and
white
with
bitter
flowers
and
bright
salt
scurf
of
brine
heard
sweep
their
sharp
swift
gales
and
bowing
shriek
with
birds
voices
and
with
furious
feet
tread
loose
the
long
skirts
of
a
storm
and
saw
the
whole
white
euxine
clash
together
and
fall
and
thunderous
from
a
thousand
throats
yet
we
drew
thither
and
won
the
fleece
and
won
medea
deadlier
than
the
sea
but
there
seeing
many
a
wonder
and
fearful
things
to
men
i
saw
not
one
thing
like
this
one
seen
here
most
fair
and
fearful
feminine
a
god
faultless
whom
i
that
love
not
being
unlike
fear
and
give
honour
and
choose
from
all
the
gods
oeneus
lady
the
daughter
of
thestius
and
thou
son
not
ignorant
of
your
strife
nor
light
of
wit
scared
with
vain
dreams
and
fluttering
like
spent
fire
i
come
to
judge
between
you
but
a
king
full
of
past
days
and
wise
from
years
endured
nor
thee
i
praise
who
art
fain
to
undo
things
done
nor
thee
who
art
swift
to
esteem
them
overmuch
for
what
the
hours
have
given
is
given
and
this
changeless
howbeit
these
change
and
in
good
time
devise
new
things
and
good
not
one
thing
still
us
have
they
sent
now
at
our
need
for
help
among
men
armed
a
woman
foreign
born
virgin
not
like
the
natural
flower
of
things
that
grows
and
bears
and
brings
forth
fruit
and
dies
unlovable
no
light
for
a
husband
house
espoused
a
glory
among
unwedded
girls
and
chosen
of
gods
who
reverence
maidenhood
these
too
we
honour
in
honouring
her
but
thou
abstain
thy
feet
from
following
and
thine
eyes
from
amorous
touch
nor
set
toward
hers
thine
heart
son
lest
hate
bear
no
deadlier
fruit
than
love
althaea
o
king
thou
art
wise
but
wisdom
halts
and
just
but
the
gods
love
not
justice
more
than
fate
and
smite
the
righteous
and
the
violent
mouth
and
mix
with
insolent
blood
the
reverent
man
and
bruise
the
holier
as
the
lying
lips
enough
for
wise
words
fail
me
and
my
heart
takes
fire
and
trembles
flamewise
o
my
son
o
child
for
thine
head
sake
mine
eyes
wax
thick
turning
toward
thee
so
goodly
a
weaponed
man
so
glorious
and
for
love
of
thine
own
eyes
they
are
darkened
and
tears
burn
them
fierce
as
fire
and
my
lips
pause
and
my
soul
sinks
with
love
but
by
thine
hand
by
thy
sweet
life
and
eyes
by
thy
great
heart
and
these
clasped
knees
o
son
i
pray
thee
that
thou
slay
me
not
with
thee
for
there
was
never
a
mother
loved
her
sons
better
and
never
a
queen
of
men
more
perfect
in
her
heart
toward
whom
she
loved
for
what
lies
light
on
many
and
they
forget
small
things
and
transitory
as
a
wind
o
the
sea
i
forget
never
i
have
seen
thee
all
thine
years
a
man
in
arms
strong
and
a
joy
to
men
seeing
thine
head
glitter
and
thine
hand
burn
its
way
through
a
heavy
and
iron
furrow
of
sundering
spears
but
always
also
a
flower
of
three
suns
old
the
small
one
thing
that
lying
drew
down
my
life
to
lie
with
thee
and
feed
thee
a
child
and
weak
mine
a
delight
to
no
man
sweet
to
me
who
then
sought
to
thee
who
gat
help
who
knew
if
thou
wert
goodly
nay
no
man
at
all
or
what
sea
saw
thee
or
sounded
with
thine
oar
child
or
what
strange
land
shone
with
war
through
thee
but
fair
for
me
thou
wert
o
little
life
fruitless
the
fruit
of
mine
own
flesh
and
blind
more
than
much
gold
ungrown
a
foolish
flower
for
silver
nor
bright
snow
nor
feather
of
foam
was
whiter
and
no
gold
yellower
than
thine
hair
o
child
my
child
and
now
thou
art
lordlier
grown
not
lovelier
nor
a
new
thing
in
mine
eyes
i
charge
thee
by
thy
soul
and
this
my
breast
fear
thou
the
gods
and
me
and
thine
own
heart
lest
all
these
turn
against
thee
for
who
knows
what
wind
upon
what
wave
of
altering
time
shall
speak
a
storm
and
blow
calamity
and
there
is
nothing
stabile
in
the
world
but
the
gods
break
it
yet
not
less
fair
son
if
but
one
thing
be
stronger
if
one
endure
surely
the
bitter
and
the
rooted
love
that
burns
between
us
going
from
me
to
thee
shall
more
endure
than
all
things
what
dost
thou
following
strange
loves
why
wilt
thou
kill
mine
heart
lo
i
talk
wild
and
windy
words
and
fall
from
my
clear
wits
and
seem
of
mine
own
self
dethroned
dispraised
disseated
and
my
mind
that
was
my
crown
breaks
and
mine
heart
is
gone
and
i
am
naked
of
my
soul
and
stand
ashamed
as
a
mean
woman
take
thou
thought
live
if
thou
wilt
and
if
thou
wilt
not
look
the
gods
have
given
thee
life
to
lose
or
keep
thou
shalt
not
die
as
men
die
but
thine
end
fallen
upon
thee
shall
break
me
unaware
meleager
queen
my
whole
heart
is
molten
with
thy
tears
and
my
limbs
yearn
with
pity
of
thee
and
love
compels
with
grief
mine
eyes
and
labouring
breath
for
what
thou
art
i
know
thee
and
this
thy
breast
and
thy
fair
eyes
i
worship
and
am
bound
toward
thee
in
spirit
and
love
thee
in
all
my
soul
for
there
is
nothing
terribler
to
men
than
the
sweet
face
of
mothers
and
the
might
but
what
shall
be
let
be
for
us
the
day
once
only
lives
a
little
and
is
not
found
time
and
the
fruitful
hour
are
more
than
we
and
these
lay
hold
upon
us
but
thou
god
zeus
the
sole
steersman
of
the
helm
of
things
father
be
swift
to
see
us
and
as
thou
wilt
help
or
if
adverse
as
thou
wilt
refrain
chorus
we
have
seen
thee
o
love
thou
art
fair
thou
art
goodly
o
love
thy
wings
make
light
in
the
air
as
the
wings
of
a
dove
thy
feet
are
as
winds
that
divide
the
stream
of
the
sea
earth
is
thy
covering
to
hide
thee
the
garment
of
thee
thou
art
swift
and
subtle
and
blind
as
a
flame
of
fire
before
thee
the
laughter
behind
thee
the
tears
of
desire
and
twain
go
forth
beside
thee
a
man
with
a
maid
her
eyes
are
the
eyes
of
a
bride
whom
delight
makes
afraid
as
the
breath
in
the
buds
that
stir
is
her
bridal
breath
but
fate
is
the
name
of
her
and
his
name
is
death
for
an
evil
blossom
was
born
of
and
the
frothing
of
blood
and
bitter
of
fruit
and
the
seed
of
it
laughter
and
tears
and
the
leaves
of
it
madness
and
scorn
a
bitter
flower
from
the
bud
sprung
of
the
sea
without
root
sprung
without
graft
from
the
years
the
weft
of
the
world
was
untorn
that
is
woven
of
the
day
on
the
night
the
hair
of
the
hours
was
not
white
nor
the
raiment
of
time
overworn
when
a
wonder
a
world
delight
a
perilous
goddess
was
born
and
the
waves
of
the
sea
as
she
came
clove
and
the
foam
at
her
feet
fawning
rejoiced
to
bring
forth
a
fleshly
blossom
a
flame
filling
the
heavens
with
heat
to
the
cold
white
ends
of
the
north
and
in
air
the
clamorous
birds
and
men
upon
earth
that
hear
sweet
articulate
words
sweetly
divided
apart
and
in
shallow
and
channel
and
mere
the
rapid
and
footless
herds
rejoiced
being
foolish
of
heart
for
all
they
said
upon
earth
she
is
fair
she
is
white
like
a
dove
and
the
life
of
the
world
in
her
breath
breathes
and
is
born
at
her
birth
for
they
knew
thee
for
mother
of
love
and
knew
thee
not
mother
of
death
what
hadst
thou
to
do
being
born
mother
when
winds
were
at
ease
as
a
flower
of
the
springtime
of
corn
a
flower
of
the
foam
of
the
seas
for
bitter
thou
wast
from
thy
birth
aphrodite
a
mother
of
strife
for
before
thee
some
rest
was
on
earth
a
little
respite
from
tears
a
little
pleasure
of
life
for
life
was
not
then
as
thou
art
but
as
one
that
waxeth
in
years
a
fruitful
wife
earth
had
no
thorn
and
desire
no
sting
neither
death
any
dart
what
hadst
thou
to
do
amongst
these
thou
clothed
with
a
burning
fire
thou
girt
with
sorrow
of
heart
thou
sprung
of
the
seed
of
the
seas
as
an
ear
from
a
seed
of
corn
as
a
brand
plucked
forth
of
a
pyre
as
a
ray
shed
forth
of
the
morn
for
division
of
soul
and
disease
for
a
dart
and
a
sting
and
a
thorn
what
ailed
thee
then
to
be
born
was
there
not
evil
enough
mother
and
anguish
on
earth
born
with
a
man
at
his
birth
wastes
underfoot
and
above
storm
out
of
heaven
and
dearth
shaken
down
from
the
shining
thereof
wrecks
from
afar
overseas
and
peril
of
shallow
and
firth
and
tears
that
spring
and
increase
in
the
barren
places
of
mirth
that
thou
having
wings
as
a
dove
being
girt
with
desire
for
a
girth
that
thou
must
come
after
these
that
thou
must
lay
on
him
love
thou
shouldst
not
so
have
been
born
but
death
should
have
risen
with
thee
mother
and
visible
fear
grief
and
the
wringing
of
hands
and
noise
of
many
that
mourn
the
smitten
bosom
the
knee
bowed
and
in
each
man
ear
a
cry
as
of
perishing
lands
a
moan
as
of
people
in
prison
a
tumult
of
infinite
griefs
and
thunder
of
storm
on
the
sands
and
wailing
of
wives
on
the
shore
and
under
thee
newly
arisen
loud
shoals
and
shipwrecking
reefs
fierce
air
and
violent
light
sail
rent
and
sundering
oar
darkness
and
noises
of
night
clashing
of
streams
in
the
sea
wave
against
wave
as
a
sword
clamour
of
currents
and
foam
rains
making
ruin
on
earth
winds
that
wax
ravenous
and
roam
as
wolves
in
a
wolfish
horde
fruits
growing
faint
in
the
tree
and
blind
things
dead
in
their
birth
famine
and
blighting
of
corn
when
thy
time
was
come
to
be
born
all
these
we
know
of
but
thee
who
shall
discern
or
declare
in
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
sea
the
light
of
thine
eyelids
and
hair
the
light
of
thy
bosom
as
fire
between
the
wheel
of
the
sun
and
the
flying
flames
of
the
air
wilt
thou
turn
thee
not
yet
nor
have
pity
but
abide
with
despair
and
desire
and
the
crying
of
armies
undone
lamentation
of
one
with
another
and
breaking
of
city
by
city
the
dividing
of
friend
against
friend
the
severing
of
brother
and
brother
wilt
thou
utterly
bring
to
an
end
have
mercy
mother
for
against
all
men
from
of
old
thou
hast
set
thine
hand
as
a
curse
and
cast
out
gods
from
their
places
these
things
are
spoken
of
thee
strong
kings
and
goodly
with
gold
thou
hast
found
out
arrows
to
pierce
and
made
their
kingdoms
and
races
as
dust
and
surf
of
the
sea
all
these
overburdened
with
woes
and
with
length
of
their
days
waxen
weak
thou
slewest
and
sentest
moreover
upon
tyro
an
evil
thing
rent
hair
and
a
fetter
and
blows
making
bloody
the
flower
of
the
cheek
though
she
lay
by
a
god
as
a
lover
though
fair
and
the
seed
of
a
king
for
of
old
being
full
of
thy
fire
she
endured
not
longer
to
wear
on
her
bosom
a
saffron
vest
on
her
shoulder
an
ashwood
quiver
being
mixed
and
made
one
through
desire
with
enipeus
and
all
her
hair
made
moist
with
his
mouth
and
her
breast
filled
full
of
the
foam
of
the
river
atalanta
sun
and
clear
light
among
green
hills
and
day
late
risen
and
long
sought
after

of

wherefore
all
ye
stand
up
on
my
side
if

me
a

strung
for

uncheered
the

me
that
i
may
slay
this

no

nor

lest
these
mock
thee
though
a

who
hast
made

strong
and
thou
being

held
foolish
for
wise
is
that
thing
which
endures
atalanta
men
and
the
chosen
of
all
this
people
and
thou
king
i
beseech
you
a
little
bear
with
me
for
if
my
life
be
shameful
that
i
live
let
the
gods
witness
and
their
wrath
but
these
cast
no
such
word
against
me
thou
o
mine
o
holy
o
happy
goddess
if
i
sin
changing
the
words
of
women
and
the
works
for
spears
and
strange
men
faces
hast
not
thou
one
shaft
of
all
thy
sudden
seven
that
pierced
seven
through
the
bosom
or
shining
throat
or
side
all
couched
about
one
mother
loosening
knees
all
holy
born
engrafted
of
tantalus
but
if
toward
any
of
you
i
am
overbold
that
take
thus
much
upon
me
let
him
think
how
i
for
all
my
forest
holiness
fame
and
this
armed
and
iron
maidenhood
pay
thus
much
also
i
shall
have
no
man
love
for
ever
and
no
face
of
children
born
or
feeding
lips
upon
me
or
fastening
eyes
for
ever
nor
being
dead
shall
kings
my
sons
mourn
me
and
bury
and
tears
on
daughters
cheeks
burn
but
a
cold
and
sacred
life
but
strange
but
far
from
dances
and
the
torch
far
off
from
flowers
or
any
bed
of
man
shall
my
life
be
for
ever
me
the
snows
that
face
the
first
o
the
morning
and
cold
hills
full
of
the
and
storms
and
many
a
wandering
wing
of
noisy
nights
that
know
the
thunder
and
hear
the
thickening
wolves
me
the
utmost
pine
and
footless
frost
of
woods
that
talk
with
many
winds
and
gods
the
hours
and
white
divisions
of
the
dawn
springs
with
the
intermitting
reed
and
streams
that
murmur
of
the
mother
snow
me
these
allure
and
know
me
but
no
man
knows
and
my
goddess
only
lo
now
see
if
one
of
all
you
these
things
vex
at
all
would
god
that
any
of
you
had
all
the
praise
and
i
no
manner
of
memory
when
i
die
so
might
i
show
before
her
perfect
eyes
pure
whom
i
follow
a
maiden
to
my
death
but
for
the
rest
let
all
have
all
they
will
for
is
it
a
grief
to
you
that
i
have
part
being
woman
merely
in
your
male
might
and
deeds
done
by
main
strength
yet
in
my
body
is
throned
as
great
a
heart
and
in
my
spirit
o
men
i
have
not
less
of
godlike
evil
it
were
that
one
a
coward
should
mix
with
you
one
hand
fearful
one
eye
abase
itself
and
these
well
might
ye
hate
and
well
revile
not
me
for
not
the
difference
of
the
several
flesh
being
vile
or
noble
or
beautiful
or
base
makes
praiseworthy
but
purer
spirit
and
heart
higher
than
these
meaner
mouths
and
limbs
that
feed
rise
rest
and
are
and
are
not
and
for
me
what
should
i
say
but
by
the
gods
of
the
world
and
this
my
maiden
body
by
all
oaths
that
bind
the
tongue
of
men
and
the
evil
will
i
am
not
nor
desire
crowns
nor
the
spoil
of
slain
things
nor
the
fame
feed
ye
on
these
eat
and
wax
fat
cry
out
laugh
having
eaten
and
leap
without
a
lyre
sing
mix
the
wind
with
clamour
smite
and
shake
sonorous
timbrels
and
tumultuous
hair
and
fill
the
dance
up
with
tempestuous
feet
for
i
will
none
but
having
prayed
my
prayers
and
made
for
prosperities
i
shall
go
hence
and
no
man
see
me
more
what
thing
is
this
for
you
to
shout
me
down
what
for
a
man
to
grudge
me
this
my
life
as
it
were
envious
of
all
yours
and
i
a
thief
of
reputations
nay
for
now
if
there
be
any
highest
in
heaven
a
god
above
all
thrones
and
thunders
of
the
gods
throned
and
the
wheel
of
the
world
roll
under
him
judge
he
between
me
and
all
of
you
and
see
it
i
transgress
at
all
but
ye
refrain
transgressing
hands
and
reinless
mouths
and
keep
silence
lest
by
much
foam
of
violent
words
and
proper
poison
of
your
lips
ye
die
oeneus
o
flower
of
tegea
maiden
fleetest
foot
and
holiest
head
of
women
have
good
cheer
of
thy
good
words
but
ye
depart
with
her
in
peace
and
reverence
each
with
blameless
eye
following
his
fate
exalt
your
hands
and
hearts
strike
cease
not
arrow
on
arrow
and
wound
on
wound
and
go
with
gods
and
with
the
gods
return
chorus
who
hath
given
man
speech
or
who
hath
set
therein
a
thorn
for
peril
and
a
snare
for
sin
for
in
the
word
his
life
is
and
his
breath
and
in
the
word
his
death
that
madness
and
the
infatuate
heart
may
breed
from
the
word
womb
the
deed
and
life
bring
one
thing
forth
ere
all
pass
by
even
one
thing
which
is
ours
yet
can
not
die
death
hast
thou
seen
him
ever
anywhere
time
brother
imperishable
as
he
is
perishable
and
plaintive
clothed
with
care
and
mutable
as
sand
but
death
is
strong
and
full
of
blood
and
fair
and
perdurable
and
like
a
lord
of
land
nay
time
thou
seest
not
death
thou
wilt
not
see
till
life
right
hand
be
loosened
from
thine
hand
and
thy
from
thee
for
the
gods
very
subtly
fashion
madness
with
sadness
upon
earth
not
knowing
in
any
wise
compassion
nor
holding
pity
of
any
worth
and
many
things
they
have
given
and
taken
and
wrought
and
ruined
many
things
the
firm
land
have
they
loosed
and
shaken
and
sealed
the
sea
with
all
her
springs
they
have
wearied
time
with
heavy
burdens
and
vexed
the
lips
of
life
with
breath
set
men
to
labour
and
given
them
guerdons
death
and
great
darkness
after
death
put
moans
into
the
bridal
measure
and
on
the
bridal
wools
a
stain
and
circled
pain
about
with
pleasure
and
girdled
pleasure
about
with
pain
and
strewed
one
with
tears
and
fire
for
extreme
loathing
and
supreme
desire
what
shall
be
done
with
all
these
tears
of
ours
shall
they
make
watersprings
in
the
fair
heaven
to
bathe
the
brows
of
morning
or
like
flowers
be
shed
and
shine
before
the
starriest
hours
or
made
the
raiment
of
the
weeping
seven
or
rather
o
our
masters
shall
they
be
food
for
the
famine
of
the
grievous
sea
a
great
of
lamentation
satiating
the
sad
gods
or
fall
and
flow
among
the
years
and
seasons
to
and
fro
and
wash
their
feet
with
tribulation
and
fill
them
full
with
grieving
ere
they
go
alas
our
lords
and
yet
alas
again
seeing
all
your
iron
heaven
is
gilt
as
gold
but
all
we
smite
thereat
in
vain
smite
the
gates
barred
with
groanings
manifold
but
all
the
floors
are
paven
with
our
pain
yea
and
with
weariness
of
lips
and
eyes
with
breaking
of
the
bosom
and
with
sighs
we
labour
and
are
clad
and
fed
with
grief
and
filled
with
days
we
would
not
fain
behold
and
nights
we
would
not
hear
of
we
wax
old
all
we
wax
old
and
wither
like
a
leaf
we
are
outcast
strayed
between
bright
sun
and
moon
our
light
and
darkness
are
as
leaves
of
flowers
black
flowers
and
white
that
perish
and
the
noon
as
midnight
and
the
night
as
daylight
hours
a
little
fruit
a
little
while
is
ours
and
the
worm
finds
it
soon
but
up
in
heaven
the
high
gods
one
by
one
lay
hands
upon
the
draught
that
quickeneth
fulfilled
with
all
tears
shed
and
all
things
done
and
stir
with
soft
imperishable
breath
the
bubbling
bitterness
of
life
and
death
and
hold
it
to
our
lips
and
laugh
but
they
preserve
their
lips
from
tasting
night
or
day
lest
they
too
change
and
sleep
the
fates
that
spun
the
lips
that
made
us
and
the
hands
that
slay
lest
all
these
change
and
heaven
bow
down
to
none
change
and
be
subject
to
the
secular
sway
and
terrene
revolution
of
the
sun
therefore
they
thrust
it
from
them
putting
time
away
i
would
the
wine
of
time
made
sharp
and
sweet
with
multitudinous
days
and
nights
and
tears
and
many
mixing
savours
of
strange
years
were
no
more
trodden
of
them
under
feet
cast
out
and
spilt
about
their
holy
places
that
life
were
given
them
as
a
fruit
to
eat
and
death
to
drink
as
water
that
the
light
might
ebb
drawn
backward
from
their
eyes
and
night
hide
for
one
hour
the
imperishable
faces
that
they
might
rise
up
sad
in
heaven
and
know
sorrow
and
sleep
one
paler
than
young
snow
one
cold
as
blight
of
dew
and
ruinous
rain
rise
up
and
rest
and
suffer
a
little
and
be
awhile
as
all
things
born
with
us
and
we
and
grieve
as
men
and
like
slain
men
be
slain
for
now
we
know
not
of
them
but
one
saith
the
gods
are
gracious
praising
god
and
one
when
hast
thou
seen
or
hast
thou
felt
his
breath
touch
nor
consume
thine
eyelids
as
the
sun
nor
fill
thee
to
the
lips
with
fiery
death
none
hath
beheld
him
none
seen
above
other
gods
and
shapes
of
things
swift
without
feet
and
flying
without
wings
intolerable
not
clad
with
death
or
life
insatiable
not
known
of
night
or
day
the
lord
of
love
and
loathing
and
of
strife
who
gives
a
star
and
takes
a
sun
away
who
shapes
the
soul
and
makes
her
a
barren
wife
to
the
earthly
body
and
grievous
growth
of
clay
who
turns
the
large
limbs
to
a
little
flame
and
binds
the
great
sea
with
a
little
sand
who
makes
desire
and
slays
desire
with
shame
who
shakes
the
heaven
as
ashes
in
his
hand
who
seeing
the
light
and
shadow
for
the
same
bids
day
waste
night
as
fire
devours
a
brand
smites
without
sword
and
scourges
without
rod
the
supreme
evil
god
yea
with
thine
hate
o
god
thou
hast
covered
us
one
saith
and
hidden
our
eyes
away
from
sight
and
made
us
transitory
and
hazardous
light
things
and
slight
yet
have
men
praised
thee
saying
he
hath
made
man
thus
and
he
doeth
right
thou
hast
kissed
us
and
hast
smitten
thou
hast
laid
upon
us
with
thy
left
hand
life
and
said
live
and
again
thou
hast
said
yield
up
your
breath
and
with
thy
right
hand
laid
upon
us
death
thou
hast
sent
us
sleep
and
stricken
sleep
with
dreams
saying
joy
is
not
but
love
of
joy
shall
be
thou
hast
made
sweet
springs
for
all
the
pleasant
streams
in
the
end
thou
hast
made
them
bitter
with
the
sea
thou
hast
fed
one
rose
with
dust
of
many
men
thou
hast
marred
one
face
with
fire
of
many
tears
thou
hast
taken
love
and
given
us
sorrow
again
with
pain
thou
hast
filled
us
full
to
the
eyes
and
ears
therefore
because
thou
art
strong
our
father
and
we
feeble
and
thou
art
against
us
and
thine
hand
constrains
us
in
the
shallows
of
the
sea
and
breaks
us
at
the
limits
of
the
land
because
thou
hast
bent
thy
lightnings
as
a
bow
and
loosed
the
hours
like
arrows
and
let
fall
sins
and
wild
words
and
many
a
winged
woe
and
wars
among
us
and
one
end
of
all
because
thou
hast
made
the
thunder
and
thy
feet
are
as
a
rushing
water
when
the
skies
break
but
thy
face
as
an
exceeding
heat
and
flames
of
fire
the
eyelids
of
thine
eyes
because
thou
art
over
all
who
are
over
us
because
thy
name
is
life
and
our
name
death
because
thou
art
cruel
and
men
are
piteous
and
our
hands
labour
and
thine
hand
scattereth
lo
with
hearts
rent
and
knees
made
tremulous
lo
with
ephemeral
lips
and
casual
breath
at
least
we
witness
of
thee
ere
we
die
that
these
things
are
not
otherwise
but
thus
that
each
man
in
his
heart
sigheth
and
saith
that
all
men
even
as
i
all
we
are
against
thee
against
thee
o
god
most
high
but
ye
keep
ye
on
earth
your
lips
from
loud
words
and
longing
are
so
little
worth
and
the
end
is
hard
to
reach
for
silence
after
grievous
things
is
good
and
reverence
and
the
fear
that
makes
men
whole
and
shame
and
righteous
governance
of
blood
and
lordship
of
the
soul
but
from
sharp
words
and
wits
men
pluck
no
fruit
and
gathering
thorns
they
shake
the
tree
at
root
for
words
divide
and
rend
but
silence
is
most
noble
till
the
end
althaea
i
heard
within
the
house
a
cry
of
news
and
came
forth
eastward
hither
where
the
dawn
cheers
first
these
warder
gods
that
face
the
sun
and
next
our
eyes
unrisen
for
unaware
came
clashes
of
swift
hoofs
and
trampling
feet
and
through
the
windy
pillared
corridor
light
sharper
than
the
frequent
flames
of
day
that
daily
fill
it
from
the
fiery
dawn
gleams

a
thunder
of
people
that
cried

hissed

moved
as
a

the

heaved
half

bloodier

cried
no
lesser
cry

thunder
and
the
roar
of
wintering
streams
that
mix
their
own
foam
with
the
yellower
sea
and
as
a
tower
that
falls
by
fire

thy

shoot
out

were
despoiled
by
this
one
girl

all
they
rode
against

cast
the
fresh
crown
from

rent
her

with
spear

the

and
unmake
me
thou
i
say
althaea
since
my
father
ploughshare
drawn
through
fatal
seedland
of
a
female
field
furrowed
thy
body
whence
a
wheaten
ear
strong
from
the
sun
and
fragrant
from
the
rains
i
sprang
and
cleft
the
closure
of
thy
womb
mother
i
dying
with
unforgetful
tongue
hail
thee
as
holy
and
worship
thee
as
just
who
art
unjust
and
unholy
and
with
my
knees
would
worship
but
thy
fire
and
subtlety
dissundering
them
devour
me
for
these
limbs
are
as
light
dust
and
crumblings
from
mine
urn
before
the
fire
has
touched
them
and
my
face
as
a
dead
leaf
or
dead
foot
mark
on
snow
and
all
this
body
a
broken
barren
tree
that
was
so
strong
and
all
this
flower
of
life
disbranched
and
desecrated
miserably
and
minished
all
that
muscle
and
might
and
lesser
than
a

for
all
my
veins
fail
me
and

mine
ashen
life
burns
down
i
would
thou
hadst
let
me
live
but
gods
averse
but
fortune
and
the
fiery
feet
of
change
and
time
these
would
not
these
tread
out
my
life
these
and
not
thou
me
too
thou
hast
loved
and
i
thee
but
this
death
was
mixed
with
all
my
life
mine
end
with
my
beginning
and
this
law
this
only
slays
me
and
not
my
mother
at
all
and
let
no
brother
or
sister
grieve
too
sore
nor
melt
their
hearts
out
on
me
with
their
tears
since
extreme
love
and
sorrowing
overmuch
vex
the
great
gods
and
overloving
men
slay
and
are
slain
for
love
sake
and
this
house
shall
bear
much
better
children
why
should
these
weep
but
in
patience
let
them
live
their
lives
and
mine
pass
by
forgotten
thou
alone
mother
thou
sole
and
only
thou
not
these
keep
me
in
mind
a
little
when
i
die
because
i
was
thy
let
thy
soul
pity
me
pity
even
me
gone
hence
and
dead
though
thou
wert
wroth
and
though
thou
bear
again
much
happier
sons
and
all
men
later
born
exceedingly
excel
me
yet
do
thou
forget
not
nor
think
shame
i
was
thy
son
time
was
i
did
not
shame
thee
and
time
was
i
thought
to
live
and
make
thee
honourable
with
deeds
as
great
as
these
men
but
they
live
these
and
i
die
and
what
thing
should
have
been
surely
i
know
not
yet
i
charge
thee
seeing
i
am
dead
already
love
me
not
the
less
me
o
my
mother
i
charge
thee
by
these
gods
my
father
and
that
holier
breast
of
thine
by
these
that
see
me
dying
and
that
which
nursed
love
me
not
less
thy
though
grief
come
grief
only
of
me
and
of
all
these
great
joy
and
shall
come
always
to
thee
for
thou
knowest
o
mother
o
breasts
that
bare
me
for
ye
know
o
sweet
head
of
my
mother
sacred
eyes
ye
know
my
soul
albeit
i
sinned
ye
know
albeit
i
kneel
not
neither
touch
thy
knees
but
with
my
lips
i
kneel
and
with
my
heart
i
fall
about
thy
feet
and
worship
thee
and
ye
farewell
now
all
my
friends
and
ye
kinsmen
much
younger
and
glorious
more
than
i
sons
of
my
mother
sister
and
all
farewell
that
were
in
colchis
with
me
and
bare
down
the
waves
and
wars
that
met
us
and
though
times
change
and
though
now
i
be
not
anything
forget
not
me
among
you
what
i
did
in
my
good
time
for
even
by
all
those
days
those
days
and
this
and
your
own
living
souls
and
by
the
light
and
luck
of
you
that
live
and
by
this
miserable
spoil
and
me
dying
i
beseech
you
let
my
name
not
die
but
thou
dear
touch
me
with
thy
hands
and
fasten
up
mine
eyelids
with
thy
mouth
a
bitter
kiss
and
grasp
me
with
thine
arms
printing
with
heavy
lips
my
light
waste
flesh
made
light
and
thin
by
fate
and
with
thine
holy
maiden
eyes
drop
dew
drop
tears
for
dew
upon
me
who
am
dead
me
who
have
loved
thee
seeing
without
sin
done
i
am
gone
down
to
the
empty
weary
house
where
no
flesh
is
nor
beauty
nor
swift
eyes
nor
sound
of
mouth
nor
might
of
hands
and
feet
but
thou
dear
hide
my
body
with
thy
veil
and
with
thy
raiment
cover
foot
and
head
and
stretch
thyself
upon
me
and
touch
hands
with
hands
and
lips
with
lips
be
pitiful
as
thou
art
maiden
perfect
let
no
man
defile
me
to
despise
me
saying
this
man
died
a
woman
offering
slain
through
female
fingers
in
his
woof
of
life
dishonourable
for
thou
hast
honoured
me
and
now
for
god
sake
kiss
me
once
and
twice
and
let
me
go
for
the
night
gathers
me
and
in
the
night
shall
no
man
gather
fruit
atalanta
hail
thou
but
i
with
heavy
face
and
feet
turn
homeward
and
am
gone
out
of
thine
eyes
chorus
who
shall
contend
with
his
lords
or
cross
them
or
do
them
wrong
who
shall
bind
them
as
with
cords
who
shall
tame
them
as
with
song
who
shall
smite
them
as
with
swords
for
the
hands
of
their
kingdom
are
strong
