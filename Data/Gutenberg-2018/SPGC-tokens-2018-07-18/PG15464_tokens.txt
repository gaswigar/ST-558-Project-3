this
is
the
truth
that
our
government
is
trying
to
drive
home
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
america
we
have
always
been
happy
in
the
fact
that
ours
was
the
richest
nation
in
the
world
possessing
unlimited
supplies
of
food
fuel
energy
and
ability
but
rich
as
these
resources
are
they
will
not
meet
the
present
food
shortage
unless
every
family
and
every
individual
enthusiastically
in
the
national
saving
campaign
as
outlined
by
the
united
states
food
administration
the
regulations
prescribed
for
this
saving
campaign
are
simple
and
easy
of
application
our
government
does
not
ask
us
to
give
up
three
square
meals
a
day
nor
even
one
all
it
asks
is
that
we
substitute
as
far
as
possible
corn
and
other
cereals
for
wheat
reduce
a
little
our
meat
consumption
and
save
sugar
and
fats
by
careful
utilization
of
these
products
there
are
few
housekeepers
who
are
not
eager
to
help
in
this
saving
campaign
and
there
are
few
indeed
who
do
not
feel
the
need
of
conserving
family
resources
but
just
how
is
sometimes
a
difficult
task
this
book
is
planned
to
solve
the
housekeeper
problem
it
shows
how
to
substitute
cereals
and
other
grains
for
wheat
how
to
cut
down
the
meat
bill
by
the
use
of
meat
extension
and

which
supply
equivalent
nutrition
at
much
less

it
shows
the
use
of

and
other
products
that
save

and
it
explains
how
to
utilize
all

only
have
its
authors
planned
to

the

conserve
the

but
to
encourage
those
saving

which
must
be
acquired
by
this

if
we
are
to
secure
a
permanent
peace
that
will
insure
the
world
against
another
onslaught
by

powers
a
little
bit
of
saving
in
food
means
a
tremendous
aggregate
total
when
people
are
doing
the
saving
one
wheatless
meal
a
day
would
not
mean
hardship
there
are
always
corn
and
other
products
to
be
used
yet
one
wheatless
meal
a
day
in
every
family
would
mean
a
saving
of
bushels
of
wheat
which
totals
lbs
two
meatless
days
a
week
would
mean
a
saving
of
lbs
of
meat
per
annum
one
teaspoonful
of
sugar
per
person
saved
each
day
would
insure
a
supply
ample
to
take
care
of
our
soldiers
and
our
allies
these
quantities
mean
but
a
small
individual
sacrifice
but
when
multiplied
by
our
vast
population
they
will
immeasurably
aid
and
encourage

save
wheat
why
our
government
asks
us
to
save
wheat
with
practical
recipes
for
the
use
of
other
a
slice
of
bread
seems
an
unimportant
thing
yet
one
slice
of
bread
weighs
an
ounce
it
contains
almost
of
an
ounce
of
flour
if
every
one
of
the
country
homes
wastes
on
the
average
only
one
such
slice
of
bread
a
day
the
country
is
throwing
away
daily
over
ounces
of
flour
over
pounds
or
enough
flour
for
over
a
million
loaves
a
day
for
a
full
year
at
this
rate
there
would
be
a
waste
of
over
pounds
of
flour
barrels
enough
flour
to
make
loaves
as
it
takes
four
and
bushels
of
wheat
to
make
a
barrel
of
ordinary
flour
this
waste
would
represent
the
flour
from
over
bushels
of
wheat
fourteen
and
bushels
of
wheat
on
the
average
are
raised
per
acre
it
would
take
the
product
of
some
acres
just
to
provide
a
single
slice
of
bread
to
be
wasted
daily
in
every
home
but
some
one
says
a
full
slice
of
bread
is
not
wasted
in
every
home
very
well
make
it
a
daily
slice
for
every
four
or
every
ten
or
every
thirty
homes
make
it
a
weekly
or
monthly
slice
in
every
home
or
make
the
wasted
slice
thinner
the
waste
of
flour
involved
is
still
appalling
these
are
figures
compiled
by
government
experts
and
they
should
give
pause
to
every
housekeeper
who
permits
a
slice
of
bread
to
be
wasted
in
her
home
another
source
of
waste
of
which
few
of
us
take
account
is
bread
sixty
per
cent
of
the
bread
used
in
america
is
made
in
the
home
when
one
stops
to
consider
how
much
bread
is
poorly
made
and
represents
a
large
waste
of
flour
yeast
and
fuel
this
housewifely
energy
is
not
so
commendable
the
bread
flour
used
in
the
home
is
also
in
the
main
wheat
flour
and
all
waste
of
wheat
at
the
present
time
increases
the
shortage
of
this
most
necessary
food
fuel
too
is
a
serious
national
problem
and
all
coal
used
in
either
range
gas
or
electric
oven
for
the
baking
of
poor
bread
is
an
actual
national
loss
there
must
be
no
waste
in
poor
baking
or
from
poor
care
after
the
bread
is
made
or
from
the
waste
of
a
crust
or
crumb
waste
in
your
kitchen
means
starvation
in
some
other
kitchen
across
the
sea
our
allies
are
asking
for
bushels
of
wheat
and
we
are
told
that
even
then
theirs
will
be
a
privation
loaf
crop
shortage
and
unusual
demand
has
left
canada
and
the
united
states
which
are
the
largest
sources
of
wheat
with
but
bushels
available
for
export
the
deficit
must
be
met
by
reducing
consumption
on
this
side
the
atlantic
this
can
be
done
by
eliminating
waste
and
by
making
use
of
cereals
and
flours
other
than
wheat
in
the
wide
use
of
wheat
flour
for
has
been
due
to
custom
in
europe
rye
and
oats
form
the
staple
breads
of
many
countries
and
in
some
sections
of
the
south
is
the
staff
of
life
we
have
only
to
modify
a
little
our
habits
in
order
to
meet
the
present
need
other
cereals
can
well
be
used
to
eke
out
the
wheat
but
they
require
slightly
different
handling
in
making
yeast
breads
the
essential
ingredient
is
gluten
which
is
extended
by
carbon
dioxide
gas
formed
by
yeast
growth
with
the
exception
of
rye
grains
other
than
wheat
do
not
contain
sufficient
gluten
for
yeast
bread
and
it
is
necessary
to
use
a
wheat
in
varying
proportions
in
order
to
supply
the
deficient
gluten
even
the
rye
loaf
is
usually
made
of
rye
and
wheat
this
is
the
safest
proportion
for
home
use
in
order
to
secure
a
good
texture
when
oatmeal
is
used
it
is
necessary
to
scald
the
oatmeal
to
prevent
a
raw
taste
oatmeal
also
makes
a
softer
dough
than
wheat
and
it
is
best
to
make
the
loaf
smaller
and
bake
it
longer
about
one
hour
instead
of
the
minutes
which
we
allow
for
wheat
bread
the
addition
of
barley
flour
to
wheat
flour
makes
a
light
colored
good
flavored
bread
if
a
larger
proportion
than
this
is
used
the
loaf
has
a
decided
barley
flavor
if
you
like
this
flavor
and
increase
the
proportion
of
barley
be
sure
to
allow
the
dough
a
little
longer
time
to
rise
as
by
increasing
the
barley
you
weaken
the
gluten
content
of
your
loaf
rice
and
cornmeal
can
be
added
to
wheat
breads
in
a
per
cent
proportion
laboratory
tests
have
shown
that
any
greater
proportion
than
this
produces
a
heavy
small
loaf
potato
flour
or
mashed
potato
can
be
used
to
extend
the
wheat
it
being
possible
to
work
in
almost
per
cent
of
potato
but
this
makes
a
darker
and
moister
loaf
than
when
wheat
alone
is
used
in
order
to
take
care
of
this
moisture
it
is
best
to
reserve
part
of
the
wheat
for
the
second
kneading
graham
and
entire
wheat
flour
also
effect
a
saving
of
wheat
because
a
larger
percentage
of
the
wheat
berry
is
used
graham
flour
is
the
whole
kernel
of
wheat
ground
entire
wheat
flour
is
the
flour
resulting
from
the
grinding
of
all
but
the
outer
layer
of
wheat
a
larger
use
of
these
coarser
flours
will
therefore
help
materially
in
eking
out
our
scant
wheat
supply
as
the
percentage
of
the
wheat
berry
used
for
bread
flour
is
but
per
cent
breads
made
from
these
coarser
flours
also
aid
digestion
and
are
a
valuable
addition
to
the
dietary
in
order
to
keep
down
waste
by
eliminating
the
poor
batch
of
bread
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
principles
of
fermentation
is
the
basic
principle
of
yeast
bread
and
fermentation
is
controlled
by
temperature
the
yeast
plant
grows
at
a
temperature
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
and
if
care
is
taken
to
maintain
this
temperature
during
the
process
of
fermentation
waste
caused
by
sour
dough
or
will
be
eliminated
when
we
control
the
temperature
we
can
also
reduce
the
time
necessary
for
making
a
loaf
of
bread
or
several
loaves
of
bread
as
may
be
needed
into
as
short
a
period
as
three
hours
this
is
what
is
known
as
the
quick
method
it
not
only
saves
time
and
labor
but
controlling
the
temperature
insures
accurate
results
the
easiest
way
to
control
the
temperature
is
to
put
the
bowl
containing
the
dough
into
another
of
slightly
larger
size
containing
water
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
the
water
of
course
should
never
be
hot
hot
water
kills
the
yeast
plant
cold
water
checks
its
growth
cover
the
bowl
and
set
it
in
the
gas
oven
or
fireless
cooker
or
on
the
shelf
of
the
coal
range
as
the
water
in
the
large
bowl
cools
off
remove
a
cupful
and
add
a
cupful
of
hot
water
at
the
end
of
one
and
hours
the
dough
should
have
doubled
in
bulk
take
it
out
of
the
pan
and
knead
until
the
large
gas
bubbles
are
broken
about
ten
minutes
then
place
in
greased
bread
pans
and
allow
to
rise
for
another
half
hour
at
the
end
of
this
time
it
will
not
only
fill
the
pan
but
will
project
out
of
it
do
not
allow
the
dough
to
rise
too
high
for
then
the
bread
will
have
large
holes
in
it
a
good
proportion
as
a
general
rule
to
follow
is
cupfuls
of
flour
this
includes
added
cereals
cupful
of
water
or
milk
tablespoon
shortening
teaspoons
salt
cake
of
compressed
yeast
in
this
recipe
sugar
has
been
omitted
because
of
the
serious
shortage
but
after
the
war
a
teaspoon
of
sugar
should
be
added
the
shortening
although
small
in
quantity
may
also
be
omitted
these
materials
make
a
loaf
of
about
one
pound
which
should
be
baked
in
forty
to
fifty
minutes
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
allow
a
little
longer
time
for
bread
containing
oatmeal
or
other
grains
such
breads
require
a
little
longer
baking
and
a
little
lower
temperature
than
wheat
breads
if
you
do
not
use
a
thermometer
in
testing
your
oven
place
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
center
shelf
and
if
it
browns
in
two
minutes
your
oven
is
right
if
a
longer
period
for
raising
is
allowed
than
is
suggested
in

take
from

minutes
small

these
are
always
safe
tests
to
follow
in
your
baking
when
baked
the
bread
should
be
turned
out
of
the
pans
and
allow
to
cool
on
a
wire
rack
when

put
the
bread
in

a
sun

at

even
with
all
possible
care
to
prevent
waste
yeast
breads
will
not
conserve
our
wheat
supply
so
well
as
quick
breads
because
all
yeast
breads
need
a
larger
percentage
of

do
not
expect
that
the
use
of
other
cereals
in
will
reduce
the
cost
of
your
bread
that
is
not
the
object
saving
of
wheat
for
war
needs
is
the
thing
we
are
striving
for
and
this
is
as
much
an
act
of
loyalty
as
buying
liberty
bonds
it
is
to
meet
the
crucial
world
need
of
bread
that
we
are
learning
to
substitute
and
not
to
spare
the
national
purse
besides
this
saving
of
wheat
our
government
also
asks
us
to
omit
all
fat
from
our
yeast
breads
in
order
to
conserve
the
diminishing
fat
supply
this
may
seem
impossible
to
the
woman
who
has
never
made
bread
without
shortening
but
recent
experiments
in
laboratories
have
proved
that
bread
without
shortening
is
just
as
light
and
as
good
in
texture
as
that
made
with
shortening
the
only
difference
being
a
slight
change
in
flavor
these
experiments
have
also
shown
that
it
is
possible
to
supply
shortening
by
the
introduction
of
per
cent
to
per
cent
of
canned
cocoanut
or
of
peanut
butter
and
that
sugar
may
also
be
omitted
from
recipes
in
fact
the
war
is
bringing
about
manifold
interesting
experiments
which
prove
that
edible
and
nutritious
bread
can
be
made
of
many
things
besides
the
usual
white
flour
the
recipes
herewith
appended
showing
the
use
of
combinations
of
cereals
and
wheat
have
been
carefully
tested
in
the
forecast
school
of
modern
cookery
good
bread
can
be
made
from
each
recipe
and
the
new
flavors
obtained
by
the
use
of
other
grains
make
a
pleasing
and
wholesome
variety
a
family
which
has
eaten
oatmeal
or
entire
wheat
bread
will
never
again
be
satisfied
with
a
diet
that
includes
only
bread
made
from
bleached
flour
children
especially
will
be
benefited
by
the
change
as
the
breads
made
from
coarser
flours
are
not
only
more
nutritious
but
are
rich
in
the
minerals
and
vitamine
elements
that
are
so
essential
to
the
growth
of
strong
teeth
bones
and
growing
tissues
the
homemaker
too
will
never
regret
her
larger
acquaintance
with
materials
as
the
greater
variety
of
breads
that
she
will
find
herself
able
to
produce
will
be
a
source
of
pleasure

picture
save
meat
why
our
government
has
asked
us
to
save
meat
with
practical
recipes
for
meat
as
a
nation
we
eat
and
waste
per
cent
more
meat
than
we
require
to
maintain
health
this
statement
recently
issued
by
the
united
states
food
administration
is
appalling
when
we
consider
that
there
is
a
greater
demand
for
meat
in
the
world
than
ever
before
coupled
with
a
greatly
decreased
production
the
increase
in
the
demand
for
meat
and
animal
products
is
due
to
the
stress
of
the
war
millions
of
men
are
on
the
fighting
line
doing
hard
physical
labor
and
require
a
larger
food
allowance
than
when
they
were
civilians
to
meet
the
demand
for
meat
and
to
save
their
grains
our
allies
have
been
compelled
to
kill
upward
of
million
head
of
their
stock
animals
and
they
have
thus
stifled
their
animal
production
this
was
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
and
they
now
face
increased
demand
handicapped
by
decreased
production
america
must
fill
the
breach
not
only
must
we
meet
the
present
increased
demand
but
we
must
be
prepared
as
the
war
advances
to
meet
an
even
greater
demand
for
this
most
necessary
food
the
way
out
of
this
serious
situation
is
first
to
reduce
meat
consumption
to
the
amount
really
needed
and
then
to
learn
to
use
other
foods
that
will
supply
the
food
element
which
is
found
in
meat
this
element
is
called
protein
and
we
depend
upon
it
to
build
and
repair
body
tissues
although
most
persons
believe
that
protein
can
only
be
obtained
from
meat
it
is
found
in
many
other
foods
such
as
milk
skim
milk
cheese
cottage
cheese
poultry
eggs
fish
dried
peas
beans
cow
peas
lentils
and
nuts
for
instance
pound
for
pound
salmon
either
fresh
or
canned
equals
round
steak
in
protein
content
cream
cheese
contains
more
protein
and
three
times
as
much
fat
peanuts
hulled
more
protein
and
three
and
a
half
times
as
much
fat
beans
dried
a
little
more
protein
and
as
much
fat
eggs
one
dozen
about
the
same
in
protein
and
more
fat
it
is
our
manifest
duty
to
learn
how
to
make
the
best
use
of
these
foods
in
order
to
save
beef
pork
and
mutton
to
be
shipped
across
the
sea
this
means
that
the
housekeeper
has
before
her
the
task
of
training
the
family
palate
to
accept
new
food
preparations
training
the
family
palate
is
not
easy
because
bodies
that
have
grown
accustomed
to
certain
food
combinations
find
it
difficult
to
get
along
without
them
and
rebel
at
a
change
if
these
habits
of
diet
are
suddenly
disturbed
we
may
upset
digestion
as
well
as
create
a
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
which
is
equally
harmful
to
physical
the
wise
housekeeper
will
therefore
make
her
changes
gradually
in
reducing
meat
in
the
diet
of
a
family
that
has
been
used
to
having
meat
twice
a
day
it
will
be
well
to
start
out
with
meat
once
a
day
and
keep
up
this
régime
for
a
couple
of
weeks
then
drop
meat
for
a
whole
day
supplying
in
its
stead
a
meat
substitute
dish
that
will
furnish
the
same
nutriment
after
a
while
you
can
use
meat
substitutes
at
least
twice
a
week
without
disturbing
the
family
mental
or
physical
equilibrium
it
would
be
well
also
to
introduce
dishes
that
extend
the
meat
flavor
such
as
stews
combined
with
dumplings
hominy
or
rice
pot
pies
or
short
cakes
with
a
dressing
of
meat
and
vegetables
meat
loaf
souffle
or
croquettes
in
which
meat
is
combined
with
bread
crumbs
potato
or
rice
meat
eating
is
largely
a
matter
of
flavor
if
flavor
is
supplied
the
reduction
of
meat
in
the
diet
can
be
made
with
little
annoyance
nutrition
can
always
be
supplied
in
the
other
dishes
that
accompany
the
meal
as
a
certain
proportion
of
protein
is
found
in
almost
every
food
product
the
meat
that
we
use
to
obtain
flavor
in
sauces
and
gravies
need
not
be
large
in
quantity
nor
expensive
in
cut
the
poor
or
cheap
cuts
have
generally
more
flavor
than
the
expensive
ones
the
difference
being
entirely
in
texture
and
tenderness
freedom
from
gristle
and
inedible
tissue
there
are
many
cereals
such
as
rice
hominy
cornmeal
samp
and
many
vegetable
dishes
especially
dried
beans
of
all
kinds
that
are
greatly
improved
by
the
addition
of
meat
sauce
and
when
prepared
in
this
way
may
be
served
as
the
main
dish
of
a
meal
harvey
wiley
has
stated
that
the
meat
eating
of
the
future
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
necessity
so
much
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
and
that
meat
will
be
used
more
as
a
condimental
substance
europe
has
for
years
used
meat
for
flavor
rather
than
for
nutriment
it
would
seem
that
the
time
has
come
for
americans
to
learn
the
use
of
meat
for
flavor
and
to
utilize
more
skillfully
the
protein
of
other
foods
it
may
be
difficult
to
convince
the
meat
lover
that
he
can
radically
reduce
the
proportion
of
meat
in
his
diet
without
detriment
to
health
many
persons
adhere
to
the
notion
that
you
are
not
nourished
unless
you
eat
meat
that
meat
foods
are
absolutely
necessary
to
maintain
the
body
strength
this
idea
is
entirely
without
foundation
for
the
foods
mentioned
as
meat
substitutes
earlier
in
this
chapter
can
be
made
to
feed
the
world
and
feed
it
well
in
fact
no
nation
uses
so
large
a
proportion
of
meat
as
america
the
first
step
therefore
in
preparing
ourselves
to
reduce
meat
consumption
is
to
recognize
that
only
a
small
quantity
of
meat
is
necessary
to
supply
sufficient
protein
for
adult
life
the
growing
child
or
the
youth
springing
into
manhood
needs
a
larger
percentage
of
meat
than
the
adult
and
in
apportioning
the
family
meat
ration
this
fact
should
not
be
overlooked
the
second
step
is
to
reduce
the
amount
purchased
choosing
cuts
that
contain
the
least
waste
and
by
utilizing
with
care
that
which
we
do
purchase
fat
trimmings
and
bones
all
have
their
uses
and
should
be
saved
from
the
garbage
pail
careful
buying
of
course
depends
on
a
knowledge
of
cuts
a
study
of
the
percentage
of
waste
in
each
cut
and
the
food
value
of
the
different
kinds
of
meat
make
a
study
of
the
different
cuts
as
shown
in
the
charts
on
pages
and
armed
with
this
knowledge
go
forth
to
the
butcher
for
practical
buying
then
comes
the
cooking
which
can
only
be
properly
done
when
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
cooking
processes
such
as
boiling
braising
broiling
stewing
roasting
and
frying
are
understood
each
cut
requires
different
handling
to
secure
the
maximum
amount
of
nutriment
and
flavor
the
waste
occasioned
by
improper
cooking
is
a
large
factor
in
both
household
and
national
economy
it
has
been
estimated
that
a
waste
of
an
ounce
each
day
of
edible
meat
or
fat
in
the
twenty
million
american
homes
amounts
to
pounds
of
valuable
animal
food
a
year
at
average
dressed
weights
this
amounts
to
steers
or
over
hogs
each
housekeeper
therefore
who
saves
her
ounce
a
day
aids
in
this
enormous
saving
which
will
mean
so
much
in
the
feeding
of
our
men
on
the
fighting
line
so
the
housekeeper
who
goes
to
her
task
of
training
the
family
palate
to
accept
meat
substitutes
and
meat
economy
dishes
who
revolutionizes
her
methods
of
cooking
so
as
to
utilize
even
the
pig
squeak
will
be
doing
her
bit
toward
making
the
world
safe
for
democracy
the
following
charts
tables
of
nutritive
values
and
suggested
menus
have
been
arranged
to
help
her
do
this
work
the
american
woman
has
her
share
in
this
great

struggle

a
lack
of
proper
knowledge
of
selection
of
fish
for
the
different
methods
of
cooking
and
the
improper
cooking
of
fish
once
it
is
acquired
are
responsible
to
a
large
extent
for
the
prejudice
so
frequently
to
be
found
against
the
use
of
fish
the
kinds
of
fish
obtainable
in
different
markets
vary
somewhat
but
the
greatest
difficulty
for
many
housekeepers
seems
to
be
to
know
what
fish
may
best
be
selected
for
baking
broiling
and
the
tests
for
fish
when
cooked
an
invariable
rule
for
cooking
fish
is
to
apply
high
heat
at
first
until
the
flesh
is
well
seared
so
as
to
retain
the
juices
then
a
lower
temperature
until
the
flesh
is
cooked
throughout
fish
is
thoroughly
cooked
when
the
flesh
flakes
for
broiling
or
pan
broiling
roll
fish
in
flour
or
cornmeal
preferably
the
latter
which
has
been
well
seasoned
with
salt
and
cayenne
this
causes
the
outside
to
be
crisp
and
also
gives
added
flavor
leftover
bits
of
baked
or
other
fish
may
be
combined
with
white
sauce
or
tomato
sauce
or
variations
of
these
sauces
and
served
as
creamed

or
placed
in
a

fish
entrees
without
number
and

salad
give
opportunity
to
use
it
in
endless
variety
combined
with
starchy
foods
such
as
rice
hominy
macaroni
spaghetti
or
potato
and
accompanied
by
a
green
vegetable
or
fruit
the
dish
becomes
a
meal
leftover
bits
may
also
be
utilized
for
salad
either
alone
with
cooked
or
mayonaise
salad
dressing
or
combined
with
vegetables
such
as
peas
carrots
cucumbers
etc
the
addition
of
a
small
amount
of
chopped
pickle
to
fish
salad
improves
its
flavor
or
a
plain
or
tomato
gelatine
foundation
may
be
used
as

for

lists
of
fish
suitable
for
the
various
methods

and
the
variety
in
the

substitute
so
largely
eaten
by

epicures

too
seldom
included

during

in

we
can
not
hope
to
fulfill
this
primary
illustration
save
sugar
why
our
government
asks
us
to
save
sugar
with
practical
recipes
for
sugarless
desserts
cakes
candies
and
one
ounce
of
sugar
less
per
person
per
day
is
all
our
government
asks
of
us
to
meet
the
world
sugar
shortage
one
ounce
of
sugar
equals
two
scant
level
tablespoonfuls
and
represents
a
saving
that
every
man
woman
and
child
should
be
able
to
make
giving
up
soft
drinks
and
the
frosting
on
our
cakes
the
use
of
sugarless
desserts
and
confections
careful
measuring
and
thorough
stirring
of
that
which
we
place
in
our
cups
of
tea
and
coffee
and
the
use
of
syrup
molasses
or
honey
on
our
pancakes
and
fritters
will
more
than
effect
this
saving
it
seems
but
a
small
sacrifice
if
sacrifice
it
can
be
called
when
one
recognizes
that
cutting
down
sugar
consumption
will
be
most
beneficial
to
national
health
the
united
states
is
the
largest
consumer
of
sugar
in
the
world
in
germany
consumption
was
lbs
per
person
per
year
italy
to
that
of
france
of
england
while
the
united
states
averaged
lbs
this
enormous
consumption
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
a
nation
of
we
spend
annually
on
confections
these
are
usually
eaten
between
meals
causing
digestive
disturbances
as
well
as
unwarranted
expense
sweets
are
a
food
and
should
be
eaten
at
the
close
of
the
meal
and
if
this
custom
is
established
during
the
war
not
only
will
tons
of
sugar
be
available
for
our
allies
but
the
health
of
the
nation
improved
the
average
daily
consumption
of
sugar
per
person
in
this
country
is
ounces
and
yet
nutritional
experts
agree
that
not
more
than
ounces
a
day
should
be
taken
the
giving
up
of
one
ounce
per
day
will
therefore
be
of
great
value
in
reducing
many
prevalent
american
ailments
flatulent
dyspepsia
rheumatism
diabetes
and
stomach
acidity
are
only
too
frequently
traced
to
an
oversupply
of
sugar
in
our
daily
diet
most
persons
apparently
think
of
sugar
merely
as
a
sweetening
agent
forgetting
entirely
the
fact
that
it
is
a
most
concentrated
food
it
belongs
to
what
is
called
the
carbohydrate
group
upon
which
we
largely
depend
for
energy
and
heat
it
is
especially
valuable
to
the
person
doing
active
physical
work
the
worker
or
the
healthy
active
growing
child
but
should
be
used
sparingly
by
other
classes
of
people
sugar
is
not
only
the
most
concentrated
fuel
food
in
the
dietary
but
it
is
one
that
is
very
readily
utilized
in
the
body
per
cent
of
it
being
available
for
absorption
while
within
thirty
minutes
of
the
time
it
is
taken
into
the
system
part
of
it
is
available
for
energy
as
a
food
it
must
be
supplied
especially
to
the
classes
of
people
mentioned
above
but
as
a
confection
it
can
well
be
curtailed
when
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
housekeepers
must
avail
themselves
of
changed
recipes
and
different
combinations
to
supply
the
necessary
three
ounces
per
day
and
to
gain
the
sweet
taste
so
necessary
to
many
of
our
foods
of
neutral
flavor
with
which
sugar
is
usually
combined
our
grandmothers
knew
how
to
prepare
many
dishes
without
sugar
in
their
day
lack
of
transportation
facilities
of
refining
methods
and
various
economic
factors
made
molasses
sorghum
honey
the
only
common
methods
of
sweetening
but
the
housekeeper
of
knows
little
of
sweetening
mediums
except
sugar
and
sugar
shortage
is
to
her
a
crucial
problem
there
are
many
ways
however
of
getting
around
sugar
shortage
and
many
methods
of
supplying
the
necessary
food
value
and
sweetening
by
the
use
of
marmalades
jams
and
jellies
canned
during
the
season
when
the
sugar
supply
was
less
limited
necessity
for
the
use
of
sugar
can
be
vastly
reduced
by
the
addition
to
desserts
and
cereals
of
dried
fruits
raisins
dates
prunes
and
figs
which
contain
large
amounts
of
natural
sugar
the
sugar
consumption
can
be
greatly
lessened
by
utilizing
leftover
syrup
from
canned
or
preserved
fruits
for
sweetening
other
fruits
and
by
the
use
of
honey
molasses
maple
sugar
maple
syrup
and
corn
syrup
large
quantities
of
sugar
may
be
saved
the
substitution
of
sweetened
condensed
milk
for
dairy
milk
in
tea
coffee
and
cocoa
in
fact
in
all
our
cooking
processes
where
milk
is
required
will
also
immeasurably
aid
in
sugar
conservation
the
substitutes
mentioned
are
all
available
in
large
amounts
honey
is
especially
valuable
for
children
as
it
consists
of
the
more
simple
sugars
which
are
less
irritating
than
cane
sugar
and
there
is
no
danger
of
acid
stomach
from
the
amounts
generally
consumed
as
desserts
are
the
chief
factor
in
the
use
of
quantities
of
sugar
in
our
diet
the
appended
recipes
will
be
of
value
as
they
deal
with
varied
forms
of
nutritious
attractive
sugarless
desserts
it
is
only
by
the
savings
of
each
individual
member
of
our
great
one
hundred
million
population
that
the
world
sugar
shortage
may
be
met
and
it
is
hoped
every
housekeeper
will
study
her
own
recipes
with
the
view
of
utilizing
as
far
as
possible
other
forms
of
sweetening
in
most
recipes
the
liquid
should
be
slightly
reduced
in
amount
and
about
more
of
the
substitute
should
be
used
than
the
amount
of
sugar
called
for
with
a
few
tests
along
this
line
one
will
be
surprised
how
readily
the
substitution
may
be
made
if
all
sweetening
agents
become
scarce
desserts
can
well
be
abandoned
served
at
the
end
of

why
our
government
asks
us
to
save
fat
with
practical
recipes
for
fat
with
the
decrease
of
animal
production
animal
fats
are
now
growing
so
scarce
that
the
world
is
being
scoured
for
new
sources
of
supply
our
government
has
asked
the
housewife
to
conserve
all
the
fats
that
come
to
her
home
and
utilize
them
to
the
best
advantage
to
this
end
it
is
necessary
to
have
some
knowledge
of
the
character
of
different
fats
and
the
purposes
to
which
they
are
best
adapted
the
word
fat
usually
brings
to
one
mind
an
unappetizing
chunk
of
meat
fat
which
most
persons
can
not
and
will
not
eat
and
fatty
foods
have
been
popularly
supposed
to
be
bad
for
us
and
hard
to
digest
fats
are
however
an
important
food
absolutely
essential
to
complete
nutrition
which
repay
us
better
for
the
labor
of
digestion
than
any
other
food
if
they
are
indigestible
it
is
usually
due
to
improper
cooking
or
improper
use
if
they
are
expensive
it
is
merely
because
they
are
extravagantly
handled
the
chief
function
of
fatty
food
is
to
repair
and
renew
the
fatty
tissues
to
yield
energy
and
to
maintain
the
body
heat
the
presence
of
fat
in
food
promotes
the
flow
of
the
pancreatic
juice
and
bile
which
help
in
the
assimilation
of
other
foods
and
assist
the
excretory
functions
of
the
intestine
these
are
badly
performed
if
bile
and
other
digestive
fluids
are
not
secreted
in
sufficient
quantity
the
absence
of
fat
in
the
diet
leads
to
a
state
of
malnutrition
predisposing
to
tuberculosis
especially
in
children
and
young
persons
it
is
claimed
that
the
most
serious
food
shortage
in
germany
is
fat
that
the
civilian
population
is
dying
in
large
numbers
because
of
the
lack
of
it
and
that
von
hindenburg
men
will
lose
out
on
the
basis
of
fat
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
munitions
or
military
organization
worst
of
all
is
the
effect
of
fat
shortage
on
the
children
of
the
nation
leaders
of
thought
all
over
europe
assert
that
even
if
germany
wins
germany
has
lost
because
it
has
sapped
the
strength
of
its
coming
generation
the
term
fat
is
used
to
designate
all
products
of
fatty
composition
and
includes
liquid
fats
such
as
oils
soft
fats
such
as
butter
and
hard
fats
such
as
tallow
while
all
fats
have
practically
the
same
they
differ
widely
from
each
other
in
their
melting
point
and
the
difference
in
digestibility
seems
to
correspond
to
the
difference
in
melting
point
butter
burns
at
degrees
fahrenheit
while
vegetable
oils
can
be
heated
as
high
as
degrees
fahrenheit
furnishing
a
very
high
temperature
for
cooking
purposes
before
they
begin
to
burn
the
scorching
of
fat
not
only
wastes
the
product
but
renders
it
indigestible
even
dangerous
to
some
people
and
for
this
reason
butter
should
never
be
used
for
frying
as
frying
temperature
is
usually
higher
than
degrees
it
is
well
to
choose
for
cooking
only
those
fats
which
have
the
highest
qualities
because
they
do
not
burn
so
easily
beginning
with
the
lowest
burning
point
fats
include
genuine
butter
substitute
butters
lard
and
its
substitutes
and
end
with
tallow
and
vegetable
oils
of
the
latter
there
is
a
varied
selection
from
the
expensive
olive
oil
to
the
cheaper
cottonseed
peanut
cocoanut
and
corn
oils
and
their
compounds
and
the
hydrogenated
oils
the
economy
of
fat
therefore
depends
on
the
choice
of
the
fat
used
for
the
various
cooking
processes
as
well
as
the
conservation
of
all
fatty
residue
such
as
crackling
leftover
frying
fats
and
soup
fat
for
cooking
processes
such
as
sauteing
pan
frying
or
deep
fat
frying
it
is
best
to
use
the
vegetable
and
nut
oils
these
are
more
plentiful
and
hence
cheaper
than
the
animal
fats
the
latter
however
can
be
produced
in
the
home
from
the
fats
of
meats
and
leftover
pan
fats
which
should
not
be
overlooked
as
frying
mediums
butter
and
butter
substitutes
are
best
kept
for
table
use
and
for
flavoring
the
hydrogenated
oils
fats
lard
and
beef
and
mutton
suet
can
be
used
for
shortening
fats
in
the
purchase
of
meats
the
careful
housewife
should
see
that
the
butcher
gives
her
all
the
fat
she
pays
for
as
all
fats
can
be
rendered
very
easily
at
home
and
can
be
used
for
cooking
purposes
butchers
usually
leave
as
large
a
proportion
of
fat
as
possible
on
all
cuts
of
meat
which
when
paid
for
at
meat
prices
are
quite
an
expensive
item
all
good
clear
fat
should
therefore
be
carefully
trimmed
from
meats
before
cooking
few
people
either
like
or
find
digestible
greasy
fat
meats
and
the
fat
paid
for
at
meat
prices
which
could
have
been
rendered
and
used
for
cooking
is
wasted
when
sent
to
table
there
are
various
methods
of
conserving
fat
first
the
economical
use
of
table
fats
second
the
saving
of
cooking
and
third
the
proper
use
of
all
types
of
fat
economy
in
the
use
of
table
fats
may
best
be
secured
by
careful
serving
one
serving
of
butter
is
a
little
thing
there
are
about
of
them
in
a
pound
in
many
households
the
butter
left
on
the
plates
probably
would
equal
a
serving
or
of
an
ounce
daily
which
is
usually
scraped
into
the
garbage
pail
or
washed
off
in
the
dishpan
but
if
everyone
of
our
households
should
waste
of
an
ounce
of
butter
daily
it
would
mean
pounds
a
day
or
pounds
a
year
to
make
this
butter
would
take
gallons
of
milk
or
the
product
of
over
a
cows
an
item
in
national
economy
which
should
not
be
overlooked
when
butter
is
used
to
flavor
cooked
vegetables
it
is
more
economical
to
add
it
just
before
they
are
served
rather
than
while
they
are
cooking
the
flavor
thus
imparted
is
more
pronounced
and
moreover
if
the
butter
is
added
before
cooking
much
of
it
will
be
lost
in
the
water
unless
the
latter
is
served
with
the
vegetables
butter
substitutes
such
as
oleomargarine
and
nut
margarine
should
be
more
largely
used
for
the
table
especially
for
adults
conserve
butter
for
children
as
animal
fats
contain
vitamines
necessary
for
growing
tissues
butter
substitutes
are
as
digestible
and
as
nourishing
as
butter
and
have
a
higher
melting
point
they
keep
better
and
cost
less
oleomargarine
which
has
been
in
existence
for
fifty
years
was
first
offered
to
the
world
in
by
a
famous
french
chemist
who
was
in
search
of
a
butter
substitute
cheap
enough
to
supply
the
masses
with
the
food
element
he
had
noticed
that
the
children
of
the
poor
families
were
afflicted
with
rickets
and
other
diseases
which
could
be
remedied
by
the
administration
of
the
right
amount
of
fat
he
combined
fresh
suet
and
milk
and
called
the
product
oleomargarine
in
the
united
states
this
product
is
now
made
of
oleo
oil
or
soft
beef
fat
neutral
lard
cottonseed
and
other
oils
churned
with
a
small
quantity
of
milk
and
in
the
finer
grades
cream
is
sometimes
used
a
certain
proportion
of
butter
is
usually
added
and
the
whole
worked
up
with
salt
as
in
ordinary
owing
to
the
fears
of
the
that
oleomargarine
would
supplant
their
product
in
popular
favor
legislation
was
enacted
that
restricted
the
manufacture
of
oleo
and
established
a
rigid
system
of
governmental
inspection
so
that
the
product
is
now
manufactured
under
the
most
sanitary
conditions
which
furnishes
a
cleaner
and
more
reliable
product
than
natural
butter
nut
margarine
is
a
compound
of
cocoa
oil
which
so
closely
resembles
butter
that
only
an
expert
can
distinguish
it
from
the
natural
product
both
these
butter
substitutes
are
used
in
large
amounts
by
the
best
bakers
confectioners
and
biscuit
manufacturers
and
foolish
prejudice
against
butter
substitutes
should
not
deter
their
use
in
the
home
a
large
saving
in
cooking
fats
can
be
made
by
the
careful
utilization
of
all
fats
that
come
into
the
home
beef
and
mutton
suet
can
be
rendered
and
made
available
fats
which
have
been
saved
after
meals
are
cooked
should
be
clarified
that
is
freed
from
all
objectionable
odors
tastes
or
color
so
as
to
be
made
available
as
shortening
and
frying
fats
the
following
recipes
and
suggestions
make
possible
the
use
of
all
fats
and
as
fat
shortage
is
one
of
the
most
serious
of
the
food
problems
it
is
essential
that
every
housekeeper
have
a
larger
knowledge
of
the
utilization
and
economy
of
this
essential

why
our
government
asks
us
not
to
waste
food
with
practical
recipes
on
the
use
of
elimination
of
food
waste
is
a
patriotic
service
it
is
also
a
most
effective
method
of
solving
our
food
problem
this
country
like
all
the
powers
at
war
will
undoubtedly
be
called
upon
to
face
increasing
prices
so
long
as
the
war
continues
and
waste
in
any
form
is
not
only
needless
squandering
of
the
family
income
but
failure
in
devotion
to
a
great
cause
food
waste
is
due
to
poor
selection
of
raw
materials
to
careless
storage
and
heedless
preparation
to
bad
cooking
to
injudicious
serving
and
to
the
overflowing
garbage
pail
to
select
food
in
such
a
way
as
will
eliminate
waste
and
at
the
same
time
insure
the
best
possible
return
for
money
spent
the
housekeeper
must
purchase
for
nutriment
rather
than
to
please
her
own
or
the
family
palate
when
eggs
are
sixty
and
seventy
cents
a
dozen
their
price
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
food
value
tomatoes
at
five
or
ten
cents
apiece
in
winter
do
not
supply
sufficient
nutriment
to
warrant
their
cost
nor
does
capon
at
cents
a
pound
nourish
the
body
any
better
than
the
fricassee
fowl
at
cents
in
order
to
prevent
such
costly
purchasing
a
knowledge
of
food
values
is
necessary
the
simplest
and
easiest
way
to
plan
food
values
is
to
divide
the
common
food
materials
into
five
main
groups
and
see
that
each
of
these
groups
appear
in
each
day
menu

if
from
each
of
these
groups
the
housekeeper
when
buying
chooses
the
food
she
will
provide
the
necessary
nutriment
for
the
least
expenditure
of
money
in
war
time
such
marketing
is
essential
other
causes
of
waste
in
food
purchasing
may
be
enumerated
as
follows
ordering
by
telephone
this
permits
the
butcher
or
grocer
who
has
no
time
to
make
selection
of
foods
to
send
what
comes
ready
to
hand
whereas
if
the
housekeeper
did
her
own
selecting
she
could
take
advantage
of
special
prices
or
leaders
food
sold
at
cost
or
nearly
cost
to
attract
patronage
buying
foods
also
makes
marketing
costly
through
lack
of
knowledge
concerning
the
periods
at
which
certain
fruits
and
vegetables
are
seasonable
and
therefore
cheaper
and
in
best
flavor
housekeepers
frequently
pay
exorbitant
prices
for
poor
flavored
inferior
products
buying
in
localities
where
high
rental
and
neighborhood
standards
compel
the
shopkeeper
to
charge
high
prices
the
consumer
pays
not
only
for
the
rent
and
the
plate
glass
windows
but
for
display
of
delicacies
game
and
markets
should
be
selected
where
food
in
season
is
sold
where
cleanliness
and
careful
attention
prevail
rather
than
showy
display
many
a
dollar
is
foolishly
spent
for
delicatessen
foods
the
retail
cost
of
ready
prepared
foods
includes
a
fraction
of
the
salary
of
the
cook
and
the
fuel
as
well
as
the
regular
percentage
of
profit
the
food
also
is
not
so
nourishing
or
flavorsome
as
if
freshly
cooked
in
the
home
kitchen
buying
perishable
foods
in
larger
quantities
than
can
be
used
immediately
too
frequently
meats
fish
eggs
vegetables
milk
and
cream
are
purchased
in
quantities
larger
than
needed
for
immediate
consumption
and
lack
of
knowledge
of
use
of
causes
what
is
not
eaten
to
be
discarded
buying
foods
in
small
quantities
instead
of
in
bulk
food
costs
on
an
average
to
per
cent
more
when
purchased
in
small
quantities
select
a
grocer
who
keeps
his
goods
in
sanitary
condition
and
who
will
sell
in
bulk
then
do
your
purchasing
from
him
on
a
large
scale
and
extend
the
sanitary
care
to
your
own
storeroom
buying
foods
high
in
price
but
low
in
food
value
asparagus
canned
or
fresh
is
not
as
nourishing
for
instance
as
canned
corn
or
beans
strawberries
out
of
season
do
not
compare
with
dates
figs
or
raisins
which
are
to
be
had
at
all
times
buying
without
planning
menus
by
this
carelessness
foods
are
often
purchased
which
do
not
combine
well
and
therefore
do
not
appeal
to
the
appetite
and
so
are
wasted
unplanned
meals
also
lead
to
an
unconscious
extravagance
in
buying
and
an
unnecessary
accumulation
of
buying
foreign
brands
when
domestic
brands
are
cheaper
and
often
better
leaving
the
trimmings
from
meats
and
poultry
at
the

bring
these
home

all
other
parts
for

of
the

how
all
the

were
fed
and
then
twelve
baskets
were
gathered
up
often
after

that
which
is
gathered
up
to
be
thrown
away
is
as
large
in
quantity
and
as
high
in
food
value
as
the
portions
used
vegetables
are
wasted
in
preparation
by
too
thick
paring
the
discarding
of
coarse
leaves
such
as
are
found
on
lettuce
cabbage
and
cauliflower
discarding
wilted
parts
which
can
be
saved
by

be
cooked

rubbed
through
a
sieve
and
used
with

for
vegetable

such

are
being
conserved
by

all
these
things

probably

it
will
be

to

for

and
tactfully

the

food
administration
is
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
clean

and
this
can
be
accomplished
by
serving
smaller

insisting
that
all

accepted
be
eaten
by
keeping

cutting
the

at

as
needed
by
cooking
only
sufficient
to
supply
moderately
the
number
to
be
fed
and
no
more
it
is
a
false
idea
of
good
providing
that
platters
must
leave
the
table
with
a
generous
waste
of
cooked
food
is
a
serious
item
in
household
economy
and
no
matter
how
skillfully
leftovers
are
utilized
it
is
always
less
expensive
and
more
appetizing
to
provide
foods
at
each
meal
one
would
think
that
with
the
various
uses
to
which
all
kinds
of
foodstuffs
may
be
put
that
there
would
be
little
left
for
the
yawning
garbage
pail
but
the
secretary
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
is
responsible
for
the
statement
that
worth
of
food
has
been
wasted
annually
in
the
american
kitchen
undoubtedly
a
large
part
of
this
wastefulness
was
due
to
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
and
the
rest
of
it
to
the
lack
of
on
the
part
of
the
employees
who
have
handled
the
food
but
not
paid
the
bills
according
to
a
domestic
scientist
the
only
things
which
should
find
their
way
to
the
garbage
pail
are
egg
shells
after
being
used
to
clear
coffee
potato
skins
after
having
been
cooked

now
as

as

the

be
handled
intelligently
the
following
recipes
show
how
to
make
appetizing
dishes
from
products
that
heretofore
in
many
homes
have
found
their
way
to
the
extravagant
pail
in
these
recipes
sauces
are
prominent
because
they
are
of
great
value
in
making
foods
of
neutral
flavor
especially
the
starchy
winter
vegetables
and
rice
macaroni
and
hominy
as
attractive
as
they
are
nutritious
salads
are
included
since
these
serve
to
combine
odds
and
ends
of
meats
and
vegetables
gelatine
dishes
are
provided
because
gelatine
serves
as
a
binder
for
all
kinds
of
leftovers
and
is
an
extremely
practical
way
of
making
the
most
rigid
saving
acceptable
desserts
made
of
crumbs
of
bread
and
cake
or
cereals
are
among
the
major
economies
if
they
are
worked
out
in
such
a
way
that
they
do
not
involve
the
extravagant
use
of
other
foodstuffs
all
the
recipes
in
this
economy
have
been
thoughtfully
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
the
time
and
will
show
the

trim
all
coarse
fats
from

have
a
great
surplus
of
vegetables

be
used
by
substituting
them
for
staples
so
that
the
staples
most
needed
will
be
saved
make
all
kinds
of
vegetable
soups
especially
the
cream
soups
in

the
waste

staple
vegetables
such
