unhappy
things
by
lord
dunsany
preface
i
have
chosen
a
title
that
shall
show
that
i
make
no
claim
for
this
book
to
be
as
the
first
title
indicates
i
hoped
to
show
to
as
many
as
might
to
read
my
words
something
of
the
extent
of
the
wrongs
that
the
people
of
france
had
suffered
there
is
no
such
need
any
longer
the
tales
so
far
as
they
went
i
gather
together
here
for
the
few
that
seem
to
read
my
books
in
england
dunsany
a
dirge
of
victory
sonnet
lift
not
thy
trumpet
victory
to
the
sky
nor
through
battalions
nor
by
batteries
blow
but
over
hollows
full
of
old
wire
go
where
among
dregs
of
war
the
lie
with
wasted
iron
that
the
guns
passed
by
when
they
went
eastwards
like
a
tide
at
flow
there
blow
thy
trumpet
that
the
dead
may
know
who
waited
for
thy
coming
victory
it
is
not
we
that
have
deserved
thy
wreath
they
waited
there
among
the
towering
weeds
the
deep
mud
burned
under
the
thermite
breath
and
winter
cracked
the
bones
that
no
man
heeds
hundreds
of
nights
flamed
by
the
seasons
passed
and
thou
last
come
to
them
at
last
at
last
the
cathedral
of
arras
on
the
great
steps
of
arras
cathedral
i
saw
a
procession
in
silence
standing
still
they
were
in
orderly
and
perfect
lines
stirring
or
swaying
slightly
sometimes
they
bent
their
heads
sometimes
two
leaned
together
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
motionless
it
was
the
time
when
the
fashion
is
just
changing
and
some
were
newly
all
in
shining
yellow
while
others
still
wore
green
i
went
up
the
steps
amongst
them
the
only
human
thing
for
men
and
women
worship
no
more
in
arras
cathedral
and
the
trees
have
come
instead
little
humble
things
all
less
than
four
years
old
in
great
numbers
thronging
the
steps
processionally
and
growing
in
perfect
rows
just
where
step
meets
step
they
have
come
to
arras
with
the
wind
and
the
rain
which
enter
the
aisles
together
whenever
they
will
and
go
wherever
man
went
they
have
such
a
reverent
air
the
young
limes
on
the
three
flights
of
steps
that
you
would
say
they
did
not
know
that
arras
cathedral
was
fallen
on
evil
days
that
they
did
not
know
they
looked
on
ruin
and
vast
disaster
but
thought
that
these
great
walls
open
to
stars
and
sun
were
the
natural
and
fitting
place
for
the
worship
of
little
weeds
behind
them
the
shattered
houses
of
arras
seemed
to
cluster
about
the
cathedral
as
one
might
fancy
easily
hurt
and
frightened
children
so
wistful
are
their
gaping
windows
and
old
grey
empty
gables
so
melancholy
and
puzzled
they
are
more
like
a
little
old
people
come
upon
trouble
gazing
at
their
great
elder
companion
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
but
the
facts
of
arras
are
sadder
than
a
poet
most
tragic
fancies
in
the
western
front
of
arras
cathedral
stand
eight
pillars
rising
from
the
ground
above
them
stood
four
more
of
the
four
upper
pillars
the
two
on
the
left
are
gone
swept
away
by
shells
from
the
north
and
a
shell
has
passed
through
the
neck
of
one
of
the
two
that
is
left
just
as
a
bullet
might
go
through
a
daffodil
stem
the
corner
of
that
western
wall
has
been
caught
from
the
north
by
some
tremendous
shell
which
has
torn
the
whole
corner
down
in
a
mound
of
stone
and
still
the
walls
have
stood
i
went
in
through
the
western
doorway
all
along
the
nave
lay
a
long
heap
of
white
stones
with
grass
and
weeds
on
the
top
and
a
little
trodden
path
over
the
grass
and
weeds
this
is
all
that
remained
of
the
roof
of
arras
cathedral
and
of
any
chairs
or
pews
there
may
have
been
in
the
nave
or
anything
that
may
have
hung
above
them
it
was
all
down
but
one
slender
arch
that
crossed
the
nave
just
at
the
transept
it
stood
out
against
the
sky
and
all
who
saw
it
wondered
how
it
stood
in
the
southern
aisle
panes
of
green
glass
in
twisted
frame
of
lead
here
and
there
lingered
like
lonely
leaves
on
an
a
hailstorm
in
spring
the
aisles
still
had
their
roofs
over
them
which
those
stout
old
walls
held
up
in
spite
of
all
where
the
nave
joins
the
transept
the
ruin
is
most
enormous
perhaps
there
was
more
to
bring
down
there
so
the
germans
brought
it
down
there
may
have
been
a
tower
there
for
all
i
know
or
a
spire
i
stood
on
the
heap
and
looked
towards
the
altar
to
my
left
all
was
ruin
to
my
right
two
old
saints
in
stone
stood
by
the
southern
door
the
door
had
been
forced
open
long
ago
and
stood
as
it
was
opened
partly
broken
a
great
round
hole
gaped
in
the
ground
outside
it
was
this
that
had
opened
the
door
just
beyond
the
big
heap
on
the
left
of
the
chancel
stood
something
made
of
wood
which
almost
certainly
had
been
the
organ
as
i
looked
at
these
things
there
passed
through
the
desolate
sanctuaries
and
down
an
aisle
past
pillars
pitted
with
shrapnel
a
sad
old
woman
sad
even
for
a
woman
of
france
she
seemed
to
be
looking
after
the
mounds
and
stones
that
had
once
been
the
cathedral
perhaps
she
had
once
been
the
bishop
servant
or
the
wife
of
one
of
the
vergers
she
only
remained
of
all
who
had
been
there
in
other
days
she
and
the
pigeons
and
jackdaws
i
spoke
to
her
all
arras
she
said
was
ruined
the
great
cathedral
was
ruined
her
own
family
were
ruined
utterly
and
she
pointed
to
where
the
sad
houses
gazed
from
forlorn
dead
windows
absolute
ruin
she
said
but
there
must
be
no
armistice
no
armistice
no
it
was
necessary
that
there
should
be
no
armistice
at
all
no
armistice
with
germans
she
passed
on
resolute
and
sad
and
the
guns
boomed
on
beyond
arras
a
french
interpreter
with
the
sphinxes
heads
on
his
collar
showed
me
a
picture
postcard
with
a
photograph
of
the
chancel
as
it
was
five
years
ago
it
was
the
very
chancel
before
which
i
was
standing
to
see
that
photograph
astonished
me
and
to
know
that
the
camera
that
took
it
must
have
stood
where
i
was
standing
only
a
little
lower
down
under
the
great
heap
though
one
knew
there
had
been
an
altar
there
and
candles
and
roof
and
carpet
and
all
the
solemnity
of
a
cathedral
interior
yet
to
see
that
photograph
and
to
stand
on
that
weedy
heap
in
the
wind
under
the
jackdaws
was
a
contrast
with
which
the
mind
fumbled
i
walked
a
little
with
the
french
interpreter
we
came
to
a
little
shrine
in
the
southern
aisle
it
had
been
all
paved
with
marble
and
the
marble
was
broken
into
hundreds
of
pieces
and
someone
had
carefully
picked
up
all
the
bits
and
laid
them
together
on
the
altar
and
this
pathetic
heap
that
was
gathered
of
broken
bits
had
drawn
many
to
stop
and
gaze
at
it
and
idly
as
soldiers
will
they
had
written
their
names
on
them
every
bit
had
a
name
on
it
with
but
a
touch
of
irony
the
frenchman
said
all
that
is
necessary
to
bring
your
name
to
posterity
is
to
write
it
on
one
of
these
stones
no
i
said
i
will
do
it
by
describing
all
this
and
we
both
laughed
i
have
not
done
it
yet
there
is
more
to
say
of
arras
as
i
begin
the
tale
of
ruin
and
wrong
the
man
who
did
it
totters
his
gaudy
power
begins
to
stream
away
like
the
leaves
of
autumn
soon
his
throne
will
be
bare
and
i
shall
have
but
begun
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
of
calamity
in
cathedral
and
little
gardens
of
arras
the
winter
of
the
hohenzollerns
will
come
sceptre
uniforms
stars
and
courtiers
all
gone
still
the
world
will
not
know
half
of
the
bitter
wrongs
of
arras
and
spring
will
bring
a
new
time
and
cover
the
trenches
with
green
and
the
pigeons
will
preen
themselves
on
the
shattered
towers
and
the
along
the
steps
will
grow
taller
and
brighter
and
happier
men
will
sing
in
the
streets
untroubled
by
any
war
lord
by
then
perhaps
i
may
have
told
to
such
as
care
to
read
what
such
a
war
did
in
an
ancient
town
already
romantic
when
romance
was
young
when
war
came
suddenly
without
mercy
without
pity
out
of
the
north
and
east
on
little
houses
carved
galleries
and
gardens
churches
cathedrals
and
the
jackdaws
nests
a
good
war
nietsche
said
you
have
heard
that
a
good
cause
justifies
any
war
but
i
say
unto
you
that
a
good
war
justifies
any
cause
a
man
was
walking
alone
over
a
plain
so
desolate
that
if
you
have
never
seen
it
the
mere
word
desolation
could
never
convey
to
you
the
melancholy
surroundings
that
mourned
about
this
man
on
his
lonely
walk
far
off
a
vista
of
trees
followed
a
cheerless
road
all
dead
as
mourners
suddenly
stricken
dead
in
some
funereal
procession
by
this
road
he
had
come
but
when
he
had
reached
a
certain
point
he
turned
from
the
road
at
once
branching
away
to
the
left
led
by
a
line
of
bushes
that
may
once
have
been
a
lane
for
some
while
his
feet
had
rustled
through
long
neglected
grass
sometimes
he
lifted
them
up
to
step
over
a
telephone
wire
that
lolled
over
old
entanglements
and
bushes
often
he
came
to
rusty
strands
of
barbed
wire
and
walked
through
them
where
they
had
been
cut
perhaps
years
ago
by
huge
shells
then
his
feet
hissed
on
through
the
grass
again
dead
grass
that
had
hissed
about
his
boots
all
through
the
afternoon
once
he
sat
down
to
rest
on
the
edge
of
a
crater
weary
with
such
walking
as
he
had
never
seen
before
and
after
he
had
stayed
there
a
little
while
a
cat
that
seemed
to
have
its
home
in
that
wild
place
started
suddenly
up
and
leaped
away
over
the
weeds
it
seemed
an
animal
totally
wild
and
utterly
afraid
of
man
grey
bare
hills
surrounded
the
waste
a
partridge
called
far
off
evening
was
drawing
in
he
rose
wearily
and
yet
with
a
certain
fervour
as
one
that
pursues
with
devotion
a
lamentable
quest
looking
round
him
as
he
left
his
he
saw
a
cabbage
or
two
that
after
some
while
had
come
back
to
what
was
a
field
and
had
sprouted
on
the
edge
of
a
a
yellowing
convolvulus
climbed
up
a
dead
weed
weeds
grass
and
tumbled
earth
were
all
about
him
it
would
be
no
better
when
he
went
on
still
he
went
on
a
flower
or
two
peeped
up
among
the
weeds
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
the
landscape
and
drew
no
hope
from
that
the
shattered
trunk
of
a
stricken
tree
leered
near
him
white
trenches
scarred
the
hillside
he
followed
an
old
trench
through
a
hedge
of
elder
passed
under
more
wire
by
a
great
rusty
shell
that
had
not
burst
passed
by
a
where
something
grey
seemed
to
lie
down
at
the
bottom
of
many
steps
black
fungi
grew
near
the
entrance
he
went
on
and
on
over
passing
round
them
where
they
were
deep
stepping
into
or
over
the
small
ones
little
burrs
clutched
at
him
he
went
rustling
on
the
only
sound
in
the
waste
but
the
clicking
of
shattered
iron
now
he
was
among
nettles
he
came
by
many
small
unnatural
valleys
he
passed
more
trenches
only
guarded
by
fungi
while
it
was
light
he
followed
little
paths
marvelling
who
made
them
once
he
got
into
a
trench
dandelions
leaned
across
it
as
though
to
bar
his
way
believing
man
to
have
gone
and
to
have
no
right
to
return
weeds
thronged
in
thousands
here
it
was
the
day
of
the
weeds
it
was
only
they
that
seemed
to
triumph
in
those
fields
deserted
of
man
he
passed
on
down
the
trench
and
never
knew
whose
trench
it
once
had
been
frightful
shells
had
smashed
it
here
and
there
and
had
twisted
iron
as
though
round
gigantic
fingers
that
had
twiddled
it
idly
a
moment
and
let
it
drop
to
lie
in
the
rain
for
ever
he
passed
more
and
black
fungi
watching
them
and
then
he
left
the
trench
going
straight
on
over
the
open
again
dead
grasses
hissed
about
his
feet
sometimes
small
wire
sang
faintly
he
passed
through
a
belt
of
nettles
and
thence
to
dead
grass
again
and
now
the
light
of
the
afternoon
was
beginning
to
dwindle
away
he
had
intended
to
reach
his
journey
end
by
daylight
for
he
was
past
the
time
of
life
when
one
wanders
after
dark
but
he
had
not
contemplated
the
difficulty
of
walking
over
that
road
or
dreamed
that
lanes
he
knew
could
be
so
foundered
and
merged
in
that
mournful
desolate
moor
evening
was
filling
fast
still
he
kept
on
it
was
the
time
when
the
cornstacks
would
once
have
begun
to
grow
indistinct
and
slowly
turn
grey
in
the
greyness
and
homesteads
one
by
one
would
have
lit
their
innumerable
lights
but
evening
now
came
down
on
a
dreary
desolation
and
a
cold
wind
arose
and
the
traveller
heard
the
mournful
sound
of
iron
flapping
on
broken
things
and
knew
that
this
was
the
sound
that
would
haunt
the
waste
for
ever
and
evening
settled
down
a
huge
grey
canvas
waiting
for
sombre
pictures
a
setting
for
all
the
dark
tales
of
the
world
haunted
forever
a
grizzly
place
was
haunted
ever
in
any
century
in
any
land
but
not
by
mere
ghosts
from
all
those
thousands
of
graves
and
bodies
and
sepulchral
haunted
by
things
huger
and
more
disastrous
than
that
haunted
by
wailing
ambitions
under
the
stars
or
moon
drifting
across
the
rubbish
that
once
was
villages
which
strews
the
lonely
plain
the
lost
ambitions
of
two
emperors
and
a
sultan
wailing
from
wind
to
wind
and
whimpering
for
dominion
of
the
world
the
cold
wind
blew
over
the
blasted
heath
and
bits
of
broken
iron
flapped
on
and
on
and
now
the
traveller
hurried
for
night
was
falling
and
such
a
night
as
three
witches
might
have
brewed
in
a
cauldron
he
went
on
eagerly
but
with
infinite
sadness
over
the
strange
rockets
went
up
from
the
war
peered
oddly
over
the
earth
and
went
down
again
very
far
off
a
few
soldiers
lit
a
little
fire
of
their
own
the
night
grew
colder
tap
tap
went
broken
iron
and
at
last
the
traveller
stopped
in
the
lonely
night
and
looked
round
him
attentively
and
appeared
to
be
satisfied
that
he
had
come
within
sight
of
his
journey
end
although
to
ordinary
eyes
the
spot
to
which
he
had
come
differed
in
no
way
from
the
rest
of
the
waste
he
went
no
further
but
turned
round
and
round
peering
piece
by
piece
at
that
weedy
and
cratered
earth
he
was
looking
for
the
village
where
he
was
born
the
house
with
two
storeys
i
came
again
to
croisilles
i
looked
for
the
sunken
road
that
we
used
to
hold
in
support
with
its
row
of
little
shelters
in
the
bank
and
the
carved
oak
saints
above
them
here
and
there
that
had
survived
the
church
in
croisilles
i
could
have
found
it
with
my
eyes
shut
with
my
eyes
open
i
could
not
find
it
i
did
not
recognize
the
lonely
metalled
road
down
which
lorries
were
rushing
for
the
little
lane
so
full
of
life
whose
were
three
years
old
as
i
gazed
about
me
looking
for
our
line
i
passed
an
old
french
civilian
looking
down
at
a
slight
mound
of
white
stone
that
rose
a
little
higher
than
the
road
he
was
walking
about
uncertainly
when
first
i
noticed
him
as
though
he
was
not
sure
where
he
was
but
now
he
stood
quite
still
looking
down
at
the
mound
voilà
ma
maison
he
said
he
said
no
more
than
that
this
astounding
remark
this
gesture
that
indicated
such
calamity
were
quite
simply
made
there
was
nothing
whatever
of
theatrical
pose
that
we
wrongly
associate
with
the
french
because
they
conceal
their
emotions
less
secretly
than
we
there
were
no
tragic
tones
in
his
voice
only
a
trace
of
deep
affection
showed
in
one
of
the
words
he
used
he
spoke
as
a
woman
might
say
of
her
only
child
look
at
baby
voilà
ma
maison
he
said
i
tried
to
say
in
his
language
what
i
felt
and
after
my
attempt
he
spoke
of
his
house
it
was
very
old
down
underneath
he
said
it
dated
from
feudal
times
though
i
did
not
quite
make
out
whether
all
that
lay
under
that
mound
had
been
so
old
or
whether
he
only
meant
the
cellars
of
his
house
it
was
a
fine
high
house
he
said
as
much
as
two
storeys
high
no
one
that
is
familiar
with
houses
of
fifty
storeys
none
even
that
has
known
palaces
will
smile
at
this
old
man
efforts
to
tell
of
his
high
house
and
to
make
me
believe
that
it
rose
to
two
storeys
high
as
we
stood
together
by
that
sad
white
mound
he
told
me
that
his
son
was
killed
and
that
disaster
strangely
did
not
move
me
so
much
as
the
white
mound
that
had
been
a
house
and
had
had
two
storeys
for
it
seems
to
be
common
to
every
french
family
with
whose
fathers
i
have
chanced
to
speak
in
ruined
cities
or
on
busy
roads
of
france
he
pointed
to
a
huge
white
mound
beyond
on
the
top
of
which
someone
had
stuck
a
small
cross
of
wood
the
church
he
said
and
that
i
knew
already
in
very
inadequate
french
i
tried
to
comfort
him
i
told
him
that
surely
france
would
build
his
house
again
perhaps
even
the
allies
for
i
could
not
believe
that
we
shall
have
done
enough
if
we
merely
drive
the
germans
out
of
france
and
leave
this
poor
old
man
still
wandering
homeless
i
told
him
that
surely
in
the
future
croisilles
would
stand
again
he
took
no
interest
in
anything
that
i
said
his
house
of
two
storeys
was
down
his
son
was
dead
the
little
village
of
croisilles
had
gone
away
he
had
only
one
hope
from
the
future
when
i
had
finished
speaking
of
the
future
he
raised
a
knobbed
stick
that
he
carried
up
to
the
level
of
his
throat
surely
his
son
old
trench
stick
and
there
he
let
it
dangle
from
a
piece
of
string
in
the
handle
which
he
held
against
his
neck
he
watched
me
shrewdly
and
attentively
meanwhile
for
i
was
a
stranger
and
was
to
be
taught
something
i
might
not
know
a
thing
that
it
was
necessary
for
all
men
to
learn
le
kaiser
he
said
yes
i
said
the
kaiser
but
i
pronounced
the
word
kaiser
differently
from
him
and
he
repeated
again
le
kaiser
and
watched
me
closely
to
be
sure
that
i
understood
and
then
he
said
pendu
and
made
the
stick
quiver
a
little
as
it
dangled
from
its
string
oui
i
said
pendu
did
i
understand
he
was
not
yet
quite
sure
it
was
important
that
this
thing
should
be
quite
decided
between
us
as
we
stood
on
this
road
through
what
had
been
croisilles
where
he
had
lived
through
many
sunny
years
and
i
had
dwelt
for
a
season
amongst
rats
pendu
he
said
yes
i
agreed
it
was
all
right
the
old
man
almost
smiled
i
offered
him
a
cigarette
and
we
lit
two
from
an
apparatus
of
flint
and
steel
and
petrol
that
the
old
man
had
in
his
pocket
he
showed
me
a
photograph
of
himself
and
a
passport
to
prove
i
suppose
that
he
was
not
a
spy
one
could
not
recognize
the
likeness
for
it
must
have
been
taken
on
some
happier
day
before
he
had
seen
his
house
of
two
storeys
lying
there
by
the
road
but
he
was
no
spy
for
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
prussians
i
think
have
no
tears
for
what
we
saw
across
the
village
of
croisilles
i
spoke
of
the
rebuilding
of
his
house
no
more
i
spoke
no
more
of
the
new
croisilles
shining
through
future
years
for
these
were
not
the
things
that
he
saw
in
the
future
and
these
were
not
the
hopes
of
the
poor
old
man
he
had
one
dark
hope
of
the
future
and
no
others
he
hoped
to
see
the
kaiser
hung
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
to
croisilles
it
was
for
this
hope
he
lived
madame
or
señor
of
whatever
far
country
who
may
chance
to
see
these
words
blame
not
this
old
man
for
the
fierce
hope
he
cherished
it
was
the
only
hope
he
had
you
madame
with
your
garden
your
house
your
church
the
village
where
all
know
you
you
may
hope
as
a
christian
should
there
is
wide
room
for
hope
in
your
future
you
shall
see
the
seasons
move
over
your
garden
you
shall
busy
yourself
with
your
home
and
speak
and
share
with
your
neighbours
innumerable
small
joys
and
find
consolation
and
beauty
and
at
last
rest
in
and
around
the
church
whose
spire
you
see
from
your
home
you
señor
with
your
son
perhaps
growing
up
perhaps
wearing
already
some
sword
that
you
wore
once
you
can
turn
back
to
your
memories
or
look
with
hope
to
the
future
with
equal
ease
the
man
that
i
met
in
croisilles
had
none
of
these
things
at
all
he
had
that
one
hope
only
do
not
i
pray
you
by
your
voice
or
vote
or
by
any
power
or
influence
that
you
have
do
anything
to
take
away
from
this
poor
old
frenchman
the
only
little
hope
he
has
left
the
more
trivial
his
odd
hope
appears
to
you
compared
with
your
own
high
hopes
that
come
so
easily
to
you
amongst
all
your
fields
and
houses
the
more
cruel
a
thing
must
it
be
to
take
it
from
him
i
learned
many
things
in
croisilles
and
the
last
of
them
is
this
strange
one
the
old
man
taught
me
i
turned
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
for
i
wished
to
see
again
our
old
front
line
that
we
used
to
hold
over
the
hill
now
empty
silent
at
last
the
boche
is
defeated
i
said
vaincu
vaincu
he
repeated
and
i
left
him
with
something
almost
like
happiness
looking
out
of
his
tearful
eyes
bermondsey
wurtemburg
the
trees
grew
thinner
and
thinner
along
the
road
then
ceased
altogether
and
suddenly
we
saw
albert
in
the
wood
of
the
ghosts
of
murdered
trees
all
grey
and
deserted
descending
into
albert
past
trees
in
their
agony
we
came
all
at
once
on
the
houses
you
did
not
see
them
far
off
as
in
other
cities
we
came
on
them
all
at
once
as
you
come
on
a
corpse
in
the
grass
we
stopped
and
stood
by
a
house
that
was
covered
with
plaster
marked
off
to
look
like
great
stones
its
pitiful
pretence
laid
bare
the
slates
gone
and
the
rooms
gone
the
plaster
all
pitted
with
shrapnel
near
it
lay
an
iron
railing
a
blown
there
from
the
railway
bridge
a
shrapnel
bullet
had
passed
through
its
twisted
stem
as
though
it
had
gone
through
butter
and
beside
the
lay
one
of
the
great
steel
supports
of
the
bridge
that
had
floated
there
upon
some
flaming
draught
the
end
of
it
bent
and
splayed
as
though
it
had
been
a
slender
cane
that
someone
had
shoved
too
hard
into
the
earth
there
had
been
a
force
abroad
in
albert
that
could
do
these
things
an
iron
force
that
had
no
mercy
for
iron
a
mighty
mechanical
contrivance
that
could
take
machinery
and
pull
it
all
to
pieces
in
a
moment
as
a
child
takes
a
flower
to
pieces
petal
by
petal
when
such
a
force
was
abroad
what
chance
had
man
it
had
come
down
upon
albert
suddenly
and
railway
lines
and
bridges
had
drooped
and
withered
and
the
houses
had
stooped
down
in
the
blasting
heat
and
in
that
attitude
i
found
them
still
melancholy
heaps
overcome
by
disaster
pieces
of
paper
rustled
about
like
footsteps
dirt
covered
the
ruins
fragments
of
rusty
shells
lay
as
unsightly
and
dirty
as
that
which
they
had
destroyed
cleaned
up
and
polished
and
priced
at
half
a
crown
apiece
these
fragments
may
look
romantic
some
day
in
a
london
shop
but
in
albert
they
look
unclean
and
untidy
like
a
cheap
knife
sticking
up
from
a
murdered
woman
ribs
whose
dress
is
long
out
of
fashion
the
stale
smell
of
war
arose
from
the
desolation
a
british
helmet
dinted
in
like
an
old
bowler
but
tragic
not
absurd
lay
near
a
barrel
and
a
teapot
on
a
wall
that
rose
above
a
heap
of
dirty
and
smashed
rafters
was
written
in
red
paint
kompe
the
red
paint
had
dripped
down
the
wall
from
every
letter
verily
we
stood
upon
the
scene
of
the
murder
opposite
those
red
letters
across
the
road
was
a
house
with
traces
of
a
pleasant
ornament
below
the
sills
of
the
windows
a
design
of
grapes
and
vine
someone
had
stuck
up
a
wooden
boot
on
a
peg
outside
the
door
perhaps
the
cheery
design
on
the
wall
attracted
me
i
entered
the
house
and
looked
round
a
chunk
of
shell
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
little
decanter
only
chipped
at
the
lip
and
part
of
a
haversack
of
there
were
pretty
tiles
on
the
floor
but
dry
mud
buried
them
deep
it
was
like
the
dirt
that
gathers
in
temples
in
africa
a
man
waistcoat
lay
on
the
mud
and
part
of
a
woman
stays
the
waistcoat
was
black
and
was
probably
kept
for
sundays
that
was
all
that
there
was
to
see
on
the
ground
floor
no
more
flotsam
than
that
had
come
down
to
these
days
from
peace
a
forlorn
stairway
tried
still
to
wind
upstairs
it
went
up
out
of
a
corner
of
the
room
it
seemed
still
to
believe
that
there
was
an
upper
storey
still
to
feel
that
this
was
a
house
there
seemed
a
hope
in
the
twists
of
that
battered
staircase
that
men
would
yet
come
again
and
seek
sleep
at
evening
by
way
of
those
broken
steps
the
and
the
banisters
streamed
down
from
the
top
a
dress
lolled
down
from
the
upper
room
above
those
aimless
steps
the
laths
of
the
ceiling
gaped
the
plaster
was
gone
of
all
the
hopes
men
hope
that
can
never
be
fulfilled
of
all
desires
that
ever
come
too
late
most
futile
was
the
hope
expressed
by
that
posture
that
ever
a
family
would
come
home
there
again
or
tread
those
steps
once
more
and
if
in
some
far
country
one
should
hope
who
has
not
seen
albert
out
of
compassion
for
these
poor
people
of
france
that
where
a
staircase
still
remains
there
may
be
enough
of
a
house
to
shelter
those
who
called
it
home
again
i
will
tell
one
thing
more
there
blew
inside
that
house
the
same
wind
that
blew
outside
the
wind
that
wandered
free
over
miles
of
plains
wandered
unchecked
through
that
house
there
was
no
indoors
or
outdoors
any
more
and
on
the
wall
of
the
room
in
which
i
stood
someone
had
proudly
written
his
regiment
name
the
wurtemburgers
it
was
written
in
chalk
and
another
man
had
come
and
had
written
two
words
before
it
and
had
recorded
the
name
of
his
own
regiment
too
and
the
writing
remains
after
these
two
men
are
gone
and
the
lonely
house
is
silent
but
for
the
wind
and
the
things
that
creak
as
it
blows
the
only
message
of
this
deserted
house
is
this
mighty
record
this
rare
line
of
history
lost
by
the
wurtemburgers
retaken
by
the
bermondsey
butterflies
two
men
wrote
that
sentence
between
them
and
as
with
homer
no
one
knows
who
they
were
and
like
homer
their
words
were
epic
on
an
old
i
entered
an
old
through
a
garden
gate
a
pale
green
gate
by
the
road
the
cheerful
green
attracted
me
in
the
deeps
of
the
desolation
as
an
emerald
might
in
a
i
entered
through
that
homely
garden
gate
it
had
no
hinges
no
pillars
it
lolled
on
a
heap
of
stone
i
came
to
it
from
the
road
this
alone
was
not
the
road
alone
was
made
and
tended
and
kept
all
the
rest
was
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
over
a
large
whitish
heap
lay
a
virginia
creeper
turning
a
dull
crimson
and
the
presence
of
this
creeper
mourning
there
in
the
waste
showed
unmistakably
that
the
heap
had
been
a
house
all
the
living
things
were
gone
that
had
called
this
white
heap
home
the
father
would
be
fighting
somewhere
the
children
would
have
fled
if
there
had
been
time
the
dog
would
have
gone
with
them
or
perhaps
if
there
was
not
time
he
served
other
masters
the
cat
would
have
made
a
lair
for
herself
and
stalked
mice
at
night
through
the
trenches
all
the
live
things
that
we
ever
consider
were
gone
the
creeper
alone
remained
the
only
mourner
clinging
to
fallen
stones
that
had
supported
it
once
and
i
knew
by
its
presence
here
there
had
been
a
house
and
by
the
texture
or
composition
of
the
ruin
all
round
i
saw
that
a
village
had
stood
there
there
are
calamities
one
does
not
contemplate
when
one
thinks
of
time
and
change
death
passing
away
even
ruin
are
all
the
human
lot
but
one
contemplates
ruin
as
brought
by
kindly
ages
coming
slowly
at
last
with
lichen
and
ivy
and
moss
its
harsher
aspects
all
hidden
with
green
coming
with
dignity
and
in
due
season
thus
our
works
should
pass
away
our
worst
fears
contemplated
no
more
than
this
but
here
in
a
single
day
perhaps
in
a
moment
with
one
discharge
from
a
battery
all
the
little
things
that
one
family
cared
for
their
house
their
garden
and
the
garden
paths
and
then
the
village
and
the
road
through
the
village
and
the
old
landmarks
that
the
old
people
remembered
and
countless
treasured
things
were
all
turned
into
rubbish
and
these
things
that
one
did
not
contemplate
have
happened
for
hundreds
of
miles
with
such
disaster
vast
plains
and
hills
are
covered
because
of
the
german
war
deep
wells
old
cellars
battered
trenches
and
lie
in
the
rubbish
and
weeds
under
the
intricate
wreckage
of
peace
and
war
it
will
be
a
bad
place
years
hence
for
wanderers
lost
at
night
when
the
village
went
trenches
came
and
in
the
same
storm
that
had
crumbled
the
village
the
trenches
withered
too
shells
still
thump
on
to
the
north
but
peace
and
war
alike
have
deserted
the
village
grass
has
begun
to
return
over
torn
earth
on
edges
of
trenches
abundant
wire
rusts
away
by
its
twisted
stakes
of
steel
not
a
path
of
old
not
a
lane
nor
a
doorway
there
but
is
barred
and
cut
off
by
wire
and
the
wire
in
its
turn
has
been
cut
by
shells
and
lies
in
ungathered
swathes
a
pair
of
wheels
moulders
amongst
weeds
and
may
be
of
peace
or
of
war
it
is
too
broken
down
for
anyone
to
say
a
great
bar
of
iron
lies
cracked
across
as
though
one
of
the
elder
giants
had
handled
it
carelessly
another
mound
near
by
with
an
old
green
beam
sticking
out
of
it
was
also
once
a
house
a
trench
runs
by
it
a
german
bomb
with
its
wooden
handle
some
bottles
a
bucket
a
petrol
tin
and
some
bricks
and
stones
lie
in
the
trench
a
young
elder
tree
grows
amongst
them
and
over
all
the
ruin
and
rubbish
nature
with
all
her
wealth
and
luxury
comes
back
to
her
old
inheritance
holding
again
the
land
that
she
held
so
long
before
the
houses
came
a
garden
gate
of
iron
has
been
flung
across
a
wall
then
a
deep
cellar
into
which
a
whole
house
seems
to
have
slanted
down
in
the
midst
of
all
this
is
an
orchard
a
huge
shell
has
uprooted
but
not
killed
an
another
stands
stone
dead
on
the
edge
of
a
crater
most
of
the
trees
are
dead
british
aeroplanes
drone
over
continually
a
great
gun
goes
by
towards
bapaume
dragged
by
a
slow
engine
with
caterpillar
wheels
the
gun
is
all
blotched
green
and
yellow
four
or
five
men
are
seated
on
the
huge
barrel
alone
dark
old
steps
near
the
orchard
run
down
into
a
with
a
tied
to
a
piece
of
wood
beside
it
to
beat
when
the
gas
came
a
telephone
wire
lies
listlessly
by
the
opening
a
patch
of
michaelmas
daisies
deep
mauve
and
pale
mauve
and
a
bright
yellow
flower
beside
them
show
where
a
garden
used
to
stand
near
by
above
the
a
patch
of
jagged
earth
shows
in
three
clear
layers
under
the
weeds
four
inches
of
grey
road
metal
imported
for
all
this
country
is
chalk
and
clay
two
inches
of
flint
below
it
and
under
that
an
inch
of
a
bright
red
stone
we
are
looking
then
at
a
road
a
road
through
a
village
trodden
by
men
and
women
and
the
hooves
of
horses
and
familiar
modern
things
a
road
so
buried
so
shattered
so
overgrown
showing
by
chance
an
edge
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
that
i
could
seem
rather
to
have
discovered
the
track
of
the
dinosaur
in
prehistoric
clays
than
the
highway
of
a
little
village
that
only
five
years
ago
was
full
of
human
faults
and
joys
and
songs
and
tiny
tears
down
that
road
before
the
plans
of
the
kaiser
began
to
fumble
with
the
earth
down
that
road
but
it
is
useless
to
look
back
we
are
too
far
away
from
five
years
ago
too
far
away
from
thousands
of
ordinary
things
that
never
seemed
as
though
they
would
ever
peer
at
us
over
chasms
of
time
out
of
another
age
utterly
far
off
irrevocably
removed
from
our
ways
and
days
they
are
gone
those
times
gone
like
the
dinosaur
gone
with
bows
and
arrows
and
the
old
knightlier
days
no
splendour
marks
their
sunset
where
i
sit
no
dignity
of
houses
or
derelict
engines
of
war
mined
all
equally
are
scattered
dirtily
in
the
mud
and
common
weeds
overpower
them
it
is
not
ruin
but
rubbish
that
covers
the
ground
here
and
spreads
its
untidy
flood
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
a
band
plays
in
arras
to
the
north
and
east
the
shells
go
thumping
on
the
very
origins
of
things
are
in
doubt
so
much
is
jumbled
together
it
is
as
hard
to
make
out
just
where
the
trenches
ran
and
which
was
as
it
is
to
tell
the
houses
from
garden
and
orchard
and
road
the
rubbish
covers
all
it
is
as
though
the
ancient
forces
of
chaos
had
come
back
from
the
abyss
to
fight
against
order
and
man
and
chaos
had
won
so
lies
this
village
of
france
as
i
left
it
a
rat
with
something
in
its
mouth
holding
its
head
high
ran
right
across
the
village
the
real
thing
once
at
manoeuvres
as
the
prussian
crown
prince
charged
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
as
sabres
gleamed
plumes
streamed
and
hooves
thundered
behind
him
he
is
reported
to
have
said
to
one
that
galloped
near
him
ah
if
only
this
were
the
real
thing
one
need
not
doubt
that
the
report
is
true
so
a
young
man
might
feel
as
he
led
his
regiment
of
cavalry
for
the
scene
would
fire
the
blood
all
those
young
men
and
fine
uniforms
and
good
horses
all
coming
on
behind
everything
streaming
that
could
float
on
the
air
everything
jingling
then
which
could
ever
make
a
sound
a
bright
sky
no
doubt
over
the
uniforms
a
good
fresh
wind
for
men
and
horses
to
gulp
and
behind
the
clinking
and
jingling
the
long
roll
of
hooves
thundering
such
a
scene
might
well
stir
emotions
to
sigh
for
the
splendours
of
battle
this
is
one
side
of
war
mutilation
and
death
are
another
misery
cold
and
dirt
pain
and
the
intense
loneliness
of
men
left
behind
by
armies
with
much
to
think
of
no
hope
and
a
day
or
two
to
live
but
we
understand
that
glory
covers
that
there
is
yet
a
third
side
i
came
to
albert
when
the
fight
was
far
from
it
only
at
night
you
saw
any
signs
of
war
when
clouds
flashed
now
and
then
and
curious
rockets
peered
albert
robbed
of
peace
was
deserted
even
by
war
i
will
not
say
that
albert
was
devastated
or
desolate
for
these
long
words
have
different
interpretations
and
may
easily
be
exaggerated
a
german
agent
might
say
to
you
devastated
is
rather
a
strong
word
and
desolate
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
so
you
might
never
know
what
albert
is
like
i
will
tell
you
what
i
saw
albert
was
a
large
town
i
will
not
write
of
all
of
it
i
sat
down
near
a
railway
bridge
at
the
edge
of
the
town
i
think
i
was
near
the
station
and
small
houses
had
stood
there
with
little
gardens
such
as
porters
and
other
railway
folk
would
have
lived
in
i
sat
down
on
the
railway
and
looked
at
one
of
these
houses
for
it
had
clearly
been
a
house
it
was
at
the
back
of
it
that
most
remained
in
what
must
have
been
a
garden
a
girder
torn
up
like
a
pack
of
cards
lay
on
the
leg
of
a
table
amongst
a
brick
wall
by
an
lower
down
in
the
heap
was
the
of
a
large
bed
through
it
all
a
vine
came
up
quite
green
and
still
alive
and
at
the
edge
of
the
heap
lay
a
doll
green
pram
small
though
the
house
had
been
there
was
evidence
in
that
heap
of
some
prosperity
in
more
than
one
generation
for
the
bed
had
been
a
fine
one
good
work
in
sound
old
timber
before
the
bits
in
the
girder
had
driven
it
into
the
wall
and
the
green
pram
must
have
been
the
dowry
of
no
ordinary
doll
but
one
with
the
best
yellow
curls
whose
blue
eyes
could
move
one
blue
columbine
close
by
mourned
alone
for
the
garden
the
wall
and
the
vine
and
the
bed
and
the
girder
lay
in
an
orchard
and
some
of
the
were
standing
yet
though
the
orchard
had
been
terribly
wrecked
by
shell
fire
all
that
still
stood
were
dead
some
stood
upon
the
very
edge
of
craters
their
leaves
and
twigs
and
bark
had
been
stripped
by
one
blast
in
a
moment
and
they
had
tottered
with
stunted
black
gesticulating
branches
and
so
they
stood
today
the
curls
of
a
mattress
lay
on
the
ground
clipped
once
from
a
horse
mane
after
looking
for
some
while
across
the
orchard
one
suddenly
noticed
that
the
cathedral
had
stood
on
the
other
side
it
was
draped
when
we
saw
it
closer
as
with
a
huge
grey
cloak
the
lead
of
its
roof
having
come
down
and
covered
it
near
the
house
of
that
petted
doll
as
i
came
to
think
of
it
a
road
ran
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
railway
great
shells
had
dropped
along
it
with
terrible
regularity
you
could
imagine
death
striding
down
it
with
exact
paces
on
his
own
day
claiming
his
own
as
i
stood
on
the
road
something
whispered
behind
me
and
i
saw
stirring
round
with
the
wind
in
one
of
those
footsteps
of
death
a
double
page
of
a
book
open
at
chapter
ii
and
chapter
ii
was
headed
with
the
proverb
un
malheur
ne
vient
jamais
seul
misfortunes
never
come
singly
and
on
that
dreadful
road
with
every
five
yards
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
fiat
beyond
it
the
whole
city
in
ruin
what
harmless
girl
or
old
man
had
been
reading
that
dreadful
prophecy
when
the
germans
came
down
upon
albert
and
involved
it
and
themselves
and
that
book
all
except
those
two
pages
in
such
multiplication
of
ruin
surely
indeed
there
is
a
third
side
to
war
for
what
had
the
doll
done
that
used
to
have
a
green
pram
to
deserve
to
share
thus
in
the
fall
and
punishment
of
an
emperor
a
garden
of
arras
as
i
walked
through
arras
from
the
spanish
gate
gardens
flashed
as
i
went
one
by
one
through
the
houses
i
stepped
in
over
the
of
one
of
the
houses
attracted
by
the
gleam
of
a
garden
dimly
beyond
and
went
through
the
empty
house
empty
of
people
empty
of
furniture
empty
of
plaster
and
entered
the
garden
through
an
empty
doorway
when
i
came
near
it
seemed
less
like
a
garden
at
first
it
had
almost
seemed
to
beckon
to
in
the
street
so
rare
are
gardens
now
in
this
part
of
france
that
it
seemed
to
have
more
than
a
share
of
mystery
all
in
the
silence
there
at
the
back
of
the
silent
house
but
when
one
entered
it
some
of
the
mystery
went
and
seemed
to
hide
in
a
further
part
of
the
garden
amongst
wild
shrubs
and
innumerable
weeds
british
aeroplanes
frequently
roared
over
disturbing
the
congregation
of
arras
cathedral
a
few
hundred
yards
away
who
rose
cawing
and
wheeled
over
the
garden
for
only
jackdaws
come
to
arras
cathedral
now
besides
a
few
pigeons
unkempt
beside
me
a
bamboo
flourished
wildly
having
no
need
of
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
small
wild
track
that
had
been
the
garden
path
the
skeletons
of
hothouses
stood
surrounded
by
nettles
their
pipes
lay
all
about
shattered
and
riddled
through
branches
of
rose
break
up
through
the
myriad
nettles
but
only
to
be
seized
and
choked
by
columbine
a
late
moth
looks
for
flowers
not
quite
in
vain
it
hovers
on
that
are
invisibly
swift
by
its
lonely
autumn
flower
then
darts
away
over
the
desolation
which
is
no
desolation
to
a
moth
man
has
destroyed
man
nature
comes
back
it
is
well
that
must
be
the
brief
philosophy
of
myriads
of
tiny
things
whose
way
of
life
one
seldom
considered
before
now
that
cities
are
down
now
that
ruin
and
misery
confront
us
whichever
way
we
turn
one
notices
more
the
small
things
that
are
left
one
of
the
greenhouses
is
almost
all
gone
a
tumbled
mass
that
might
be
a
piece
of
babylon
if
archæologists
should
come
to
study
it
but
it
is
too
sad
to
study
too
untidy
to
have
any
interest
and
alas
too
common
there
are
hundreds
of
miles
of
this
the
other
greenhouse
a
sad
ungainly
skeleton
is
possessed
by
grass
and
weeds
on
the
raised
centre
many
were
neatly
arranged
once
they
stand
in
orderly
lines
but
each
separate
one
is
broken
none
contain
flowers
any
more
but
only
grass
and
the
glass
of
the
greenhouse
lies
there
in
showers
all
grey
no
one
has
tidied
anything
up
there
for
years
a
had
come
into
that
greenhouse
and
dwelt
there
in
that
abode
of
fine
tropical
flowers
and
one
night
an
elder
tree
had
entered
and
is
now
as
high
as
the
house
and
at
the
end
of
the
greenhouse
grass
has
come
in
like
a
wave
for
change
and
disaster
are
and
are
only
mirrored
here
this
desolate
garden
and
its
mined
house
are
a
part
of
hundreds
of
thousands
such
or
millions
mathematics
will
give
you
no
picture
of
what
france
has
suffered
if
i
tell
you
what
one
garden
is
like
one
village
one
house
one
cathedral
after
the
german
war
has
swept
by
and
if
you
read
my
words
i
may
help
you
perhaps
to
imagine
more
easily
what
france
has
suffered
than
if
i
spoke
of
millions
i
speak
of
one
garden
in
arras
and
you
might
walk
from
there
south
by
east
for
weeks
and
find
no
garden
that
has
suffered
less
it
is
all
weeds
and
elders
an
rises
out
of
a
mass
of
nettles
but
it
is
quite
dead
wild
show
here
and
there
or
roses
that
have
ran
wild
like
the
cats
of
and
once
i
saw
a
that
had
been
planted
in
a
pot
and
still
grew
there
as
though
it
still
remembered
man
but
the
was
shattered
like
all
the
pots
in
that
garden
and
the
rose
grew
wild
as
any
in
any
hedge
the
ivy
alone
grows
on
over
a
mighty
wall
and
seems
to
care
not
the
ivy
alone
seems
not
to
mourn
but
to
have
added
the
last
four
years
to
its
growth
as
though
they
were
ordinary
years
that
corner
of
the
wall
alone
whispers
not
of
disaster
it
only
seems
to
tell
of
the
passing
of
years
which
makes
the
ivy
strong
and
for
which
in
peace
as
in
war
there
is
no
cure
all
the
rest
speaks
of
war
of
war
that
comes
to
gardens
without
banners
or
trumpets
or
splendour
and
roots
up
everything
and
turns
round
and
smashes
the
house
and
leaves
it
all
desolate
and
forgets
and
goes
away
and
when
the
histories
of
the
war
are
written
attacks
and
and
the
doom
of
emperors
who
will
remember
that
garden
saddest
of
all
as
it
seemed
to
me
watching
the
garden
paths
were
spiders
webs
that
had
been
spun
across
them
so
grey
and
stout
and
strong
fastened
from
weed
to
weed
with
the
spiders
in
their
midst
sitting
in
obvious
ownership
you
knew
then
as
you
looked
at
those
webs
across
all
the
paths
in
the
garden
that
any
that
you
might
fancy
walking
the
small
paths
still
were
but
grey
ghosts
gone
from
thence
no
more
than
dreams
hopes
and
imaginings
something
altogether
weaker
than
spiders
webs
and
the
old
wall
of
the
garden
that
divides
it
from
its
neighbour
of
solid
stone
and
brick
over
fifteen
feet
high
it
is
that
mighty
old
wall
that
held
the
romance
of
the
garden
i
do
not
tell
the
tale
of
that
garden
of
arras
for
that
is
conjecture
and
i
only
tell
what
i
saw
in
order
that
someone
perhaps
in
some
far
country
may
know
what
happened
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
gardens
because
an
emperor
sighed
and
longed
for
the
splendour
of
war
the
tale
is
but
conjecture
yet
all
the
romance
is
there
for
picture
a
wall
over
fifteen
feet
high
built
as
they
built
long
ago
standing
for
all
those
ages
between
two
gardens
for
would
not
the
temptation
arise
to
peer
over
the
wall
if
a
young
man
heard
perhaps
songs
one
evening
the
other
side
and
at
first
he
would
have
some
pretext
and
afterwards
none
at
all
and
the
pretext
would
vary
wonderfully
little
with
the
generations
while
the
ivy
went
on
growing
thicker
and
thicker
the
thought
might
come
of
climbing
the
wall
altogether
and
down
the
other
side
and
it
might
seem
too
daring
and
be
utterly
put
away
and
then
one
day
some
wonderful
summer
evening
the
west
all
red
and
a
new
moon
in
the
sky
far
voices
heard
clearly
and
white
mists
rising
one
wonderful
summer
day
back
would
come
that
thought
to
climb
the
great
old
wall
and
go
down
the
other
side
why
not
go
in
next
door
from
the
street
you
might
say
that
would
be
different
that
would
be
calling
that
would
mean
ceremony
black
hats
and
awkward
new
gloves
constrained
talk
and
little
scope
for
romance
it
would
all
be
the
fault
of
the
wall
with
what
diffidence
as
the
generations
passed
would
each
first
peep
over
the
wall
be
undertaken
in
some
years
it
would
be
scaled
from
one
side
in
some
ages
from
the
other
what
a
barrier
that
old
red
wall
would
have
seemed
how
new
the
adventure
would
have
seemed
in
each
age
to
those
that
dared
it
and
how
old
to
the
wall
and
in
all
those
years
the
elders
never
made
a
door
but
kept
that
huge
and
haughty
separation
and
the
ivy
quietly
grew
greener
and
then
one
day
a
shell
came
from
the
east
and
in
a
moment
without
plan
or
diffidence
or
pretext
tumbled
away
some
yards
of
the
proud
old
wall
and
the
two
gardens
were
divided
no
longer
but
there
was
no
one
to
walk
in
them
any
more
wistfully
round
the
edge
of
the
huge
breach
in
the
wall
a
michaelmas
daisy
peered
into
the
garden
in
whose
mined
paths
i
stood
after
hell
he
heard
an
english
voice
shouting
paiper
paiper
no
mere
spelling
of
the
word
will
give
the
intonation
it
was
the
voice
of
english
towns
he
heard
again
the
very
voice
of
london
in
the
morning
it
seemed
like
magic
or
like
some
wonderfully
vivid
dream
he
was
only
a
hundred
miles
or
so
from
england
it
was
not
very
long
since
he
had
been
there
yet
what
he
heard
seemed
like
an
enchanted
dream
because
only
the
day
before
he
had
been
in
the
trenches
they
had
been
twelve
days
in
the
trenches
and
had
marched
out
at
evening
they
had
marched
five
miles
and
were
among
tin
huts
in
quite
a
different
world
through
the
doorways
of
the
huts
green
grass
could
be
seen
and
the
sun
was
shining
on
it
it
was
morning
everything
was
strangely
different
you
saw
more
faces
smiling
men
were
not
so
calm
as
they
had
been
during
the
last
twelve
days
the
last
six
especially
someone
was
kicking
a
football
at
somebody
else
hut
and
there
was
excitement
about
it
guns
were
still
firing
but
they
thought
of
death
now
as
one
who
walked
on
the
other
side
of
the
hills
no
longer
as
a
neighbour
as
one
who
might
drop
in
at
any
moment
and
sometime
did
while
they
were
taking
tea
it
was
not
that
they
had
been
afraid
of
him
but
the
strain
of
expectancy
was
over
and
that
strain
being
suddenly
gone
in
a
single
night
they
all
had
a
need
whether
they
knew
it
or
not
of
something
to
take
its
place
so
the
football
loomed
very
large
it
was
morning
and
he
had
slept
long
the
guns
that
grew
active
at
dawn
had
not
woke
him
in
those
twelve
days
they
had
grown
too
familiar
but
he
woke
wide
when
he
heard
the
young
english
soldier
with
a
bundle
of
papers
under
his
arm
calling
paiper
paiper
bringing
to
that
strange
camp
the
voice
of
the
english
towns
he
woke
wide
at
that
wonder
and
saw
the
sun
shining
cheerily
on
desolation
with
a
tinge
of
green
in
it
which
even
by
itself
rejoiced
him
on
that
morning
after
those
twelve
days
amongst
mud
looking
at
mud
surrounded
by
mud
protected
by
mud
sharing
with
mud
the
liability
to
be
suddenly
blown
high
and
to
come
down
in
a
shower
on
other
men
helmets
and
coats
he
wondered
if
dante
when
he
came
up
from
hell
heard
anyone
calling
amongst
the
verdure
in
sunlight
any
familiar
call
such
as
merchants
use
some
trivial
song
or
cry
of
his
native
city
a
happy
valley
the
enemy
attacked
the
happy
valley
i
read
these
words
in
a
paper
at
the
time
of
the
taking
of
albert
for
the
second
time
by
our
troops
and
the
words
brought
back
albert
to
me
like
a
spell
albert
at
the
end
of
the
mighty
road
that
pathway
of
mars
down
which
he
had
stalked
so
tremendously
through
his
garden
the
wide
waste
battlefields
of
the
somme
the
words
brought
back
albert
at
the
end
of
that
road
in
the
sunset
and
the
cathedral
seen
against
the
west
and
the
gilded
virgin
half
cast
down
but
incapable
of
losing
dignity
and
evening
coming
down
over
the
marshes
they
brought
it
back
like
a
spell
like
two
spells
rather
that
some
magician
had
mixed
picture
some
magician
of
old
in
his
sombre
wonderful
chamber
wishing
dreams
to
transport
him
far
off
to
delectable
valleys
he
sits
him
down
and
writes
out
a
spell
on
parchment
slowly
and
with
effort
of
aged
memory
though
he
remembered
it
easily
once
the
shadows
of
crocodiles
and
antique
gods
flicker
on
walls
and
ceiling
from
a
gusty
flame
as
he
writes
and
in
the
end
he
writes
the
spell
out
wrongly
and
mixes
up
with
the
valleys
where
he
would
rest
dark
bits
of
the
regions
of
hell
so
one
sees
albert
again
and
its
happy
valley
i
do
not
know
which
the
happy
valley
is
for
so
many
little
valleys
run
in
and
out
about
albert
and
with
a
little
effort
of
imagination
having
only
seen
them
full
of
the
ruin
of
war
one
can
fancy
any
of
them
being
once
named
happy
yet
one
there
is
away
to
the
east
of
albert
which
even
up
to
last
autumn
seemed
able
to
bear
this
name
so
secluded
it
was
in
that
awful
garden
of
mars
a
tiny
valley
running
into
the
wood
of
bécourt
a
few
yards
higher
up
and
all
was
desolation
a
little
further
along
a
lonely
road
and
you
saw
albert
mourning
over
irreparable
vistas
of
ruin
and
wasted
fields
but
the
little
valley
ran
into
the
wood
of
bécourt
and
sheltered
there
and
there
you
saw
scarcely
any
signs
of
war
it
might
almost
have
been
an
english
valley
by
the
side
of
an
english
wood
the
soil
was
the
same
brown
clay
that
you
see
in
the
south
of
england
above
the
downs
and
the
chalk
the
wood
was
a
hazel
wood
such
as
grow
in
england
thinned
a
good
deal
as
english
hazels
are
but
with
several
tall
trees
still
growing
and
plants
were
there
and
late
flowers
such
as
grow
in
surrey
and
kent
and
at
the
end
of
the
valley
just
in
the
shadow
of
that
familiar
homely
wood
a
hundred
british
officers
rest
for
ever
as
the
world
is
today
perhaps
that
obscure
spot
as
fittingly
as
any
might
be
named
the
happy
valley
in
bethune
under
all
ruins
is
history
as
every
tourist
knows
indeed
the
dust
that
gathers
above
the
ruin
of
cities
may
be
said
to
be
the
cover
of
the
most
wonderful
of
the
of
time
those
secret
books
into
which
we
sometimes
peep
we
turn
no
more
perhaps
than
the
corner
of
a
single
page
in
our
prying
but
we
catch
a
glimpse
there
of
things
so
gorgeous
in
the
book
that
we
are
not
meant
to
see
that
it
is
worth
while
to
travel
to
far
countries
whoever
can
to
see
one
of
those
books
and
where
the
edges
are
turned
up
a
little
to
catch
sight
of
those
strange
winged
bulls
and
mysterious
kings
and
gods
that
were
not
meant
for
us
and
out
of
the
glimpses
one
catches
from
odd
comers
of
those
volumes
of
time
where
old
centuries
hide
one
builds
up
part
by
guesses
part
by
fancy
mixed
with
but
little
knowledge
a
tale
or
theory
of
how
men
and
women
lived
in
unknown
ages
in
the
faith
of
forgotten
gods
such
a
people
lived
in
timgad
and
left
it
probably
about
the
time
that
waning
rome
began
to
call
home
her
outposts
long
after
the
citizens
left
the
city
stood
on
that
high
plateau
in
africa
teaching
shepherd
arabs
what
rome
had
been
even
its
great
arches
and
parts
of
its
temples
stand
its
paved
streets
are
still
grooved
clearly
with
the
of
chariots
and
beaten
down
on
each
side
of
the
centre
by
the
pairs
of
horses
that
drew
them
two
thousand
years
ago
when
all
the
clatter
had
died
away
timgad
stood
there
in
silence
at
pompeii
city
and
citizens
ended
together
pompeii
did
not
mourn
among
strangers
a
city
without
a
people
but
was
buried
at
once
closed
like
an
ancient
book
i
doubt
if
anyone
knows
why
its
gods
deserted
luxor
or
luxor
lost
faith
in
its
gods
or
in
itself
conquest
from
over
the
desert
or
down
the
nile
i
suppose
or
corruption
within
who
knows
but
one
day
i
saw
a
woman
come
out
from
the
back
of
her
house
and
empty
a
basket
full
of
dust
and
rubbish
right
into
the
temple
at
luxor
where
a
dark
green
god
is
seated
three
times
the
size
of
a
man
buried
as
high
as
his
waist
i
suppose
that
what
i
saw
had
been
happening
off
and
on
pretty
well
every
morning
for
the
last
four
thousand
years
safe
under
the
dust
that
that
woman
threw
and
the
women
that
lived
before
her
time
hid
his
secrets
and
then
i
have
seen
the
edges
of
stones
in
deserts
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
cities
they
had
fallen
so
long
that
you
could
hardly
say
at
all
these
cities
whether
disaster
met
them
and
ruin
came
suddenly
on
to
crowded
streets
or
whether
they
passed
slowly
out
of
fashion
and
grew
quieter
year
by
year
while
the
jackals
drew
nearer
and
nearer
at
all
these
cities
one
can
look
with
interest
and
not
be
saddened
by
the
faintest
sorrow
for
anything
that
happened
to
such
a
different
people
so
very
long
ago
gods
although
their
horns
be
broken
and
all
their
worshippers
gone
armies
whose
elephants
have
turned
against
them
kings
whose
ancestors
have
eclipsed
their
faces
in
heaven
and
left
them
helpless
against
the
onslaught
of
the
stars
not
a
tear
is
given
for
one
of
these
but
when
in
ruins
as
complete
as
pompeii
as
desolate
as
timgad
amongst
its
african
hills
you
see
the
remnant
of
a
pack
of
cards
lying
with
what
remains
of
the
stock
of
a
draper
shop
and
the
front
part
of
the
shop
and
the
snug
room
at
the
back
gape
side
by
side
together
in
equal
misery
as
though
there
had
never
been
a
barrier
between
the
counter
with
its
wares
and
the
good
mahogany
table
with
its
decanters
then
in
the
rustling
of
papers
that
blow
with
dust
along
floors
one
hears
the
whisper
of
disaster
saying
see
i
have
come
for
under
plaster
shaken
down
by
calamity
and
red
dust
that
once
was
bricks
it
is
our
own
age
that
is
lying
and
the
little
things
that
lie
about
the
floors
are
relics
of
the
twentieth
century
therefore
in
the
streets
of
bethune
the
wistful
appeal
that
is
in
all
things
lost
far
off
and
utterly
passed
away
cries
out
with
an
insistence
that
is
never
felt
in
the
older
fallen
cities
no
doubt
to
future
times
the
age
that
lies
under
plaster
in
bethune
with
thin
bare
laths
standing
over
it
will
appear
an
age
of
glory
and
yet
to
thousands
that
went
one
day
from
its
streets
leaving
all
manner
of
small
things
behind
it
may
well
have
been
an
age
full
of
far
other
promises
no
less
golden
to
them
no
less
magical
even
though
too
little
to
stir
the
pen
of
history
busy
with
batteries
and
imperial
dooms
so
that
to
these
whatever
others
may
write
the
will
not
be
the
age
of
strategy
but
will
only
seem
to
have
been
those
fourteen
lost
quiet
summers
whose
fruits
lie
under
the
plaster
that
layer
of
plaster
and
lies
on
the
age
that
has
gone
as
final
as
fatal
as
the
layer
of
flints
that
covers
the
top
of
the
chalk
and
marks
the
end
of
an
epoch
and
some
unknown
geologic
catastrophe
it
is
only
by
the
little
things
in
bethune
lying
where
they
were
left
that
one
can
trace
at
all
what
kind
of
house
each
was
or
guess
at
the
people
who
dwelt
in
it
it
is
only
by
a
potato
growing
where
pavement
was
and
flowering
vigorously
under
a
vacant
window
that
one
can
guess
that
the
battered
house
beside
it
was
once
a
fruiterer
shop
whence
the
potato
rolled
away
when
man
fell
on
evil
days
and
found
the
street
no
longer
harsh
and
unfriendly
but
soft
and
fertile
like
the
primal
waste
and
took
root
and
throve
there
as
its
forbears
throve
before
it
in
another
continent
before
the
coming
of
man
across
the
street
in
the
dust
of
a
stricken
house
the
implements
of
his
trade
show
where
a
carpenter
lived
when
disaster
came
so
suddenly
quite
good
tools
some
still
upon
shelves
some
amongst
broken
things
that
lie
all
over
the
floor
and
further
along
the
street
in
which
these
things
are
someone
has
put
up
a
great
iron
shutter
that
was
to
protect
his
shop
it
has
a
graceful
border
of
painted
irises
all
the
way
up
each
side
it
might
have
been
a
jeweller
that
would
have
had
such
a
shutter
the
shutter
alone
remains
standing
straight
upright
and
the
whole
shop
is
gone
and
just
here
the
shaken
street
ends
and
all
the
streets
end
together
the
rest
is
a
mound
of
white
stones
and
pieces
of
bricks
with
low
leaning
walls
surrounding
it
and
the
halves
of
hollow
houses
and
eyeing
it
round
a
comer
one
old
tower
of
the
cathedral
as
though
still
gazing
over
its
congregation
of
houses
a
mined
melancholy
watcher
over
the
bricks
lie
tracks
but
no
more
streets
it
is
about
the
middle
of
the
town
a
hawk
goes
over
calling
as
though
he
flew
over
the
waste
and
as
though
the
waste
were
his
the
breeze
that
carries
him
opens
old
shutters
and
flaps
them
to
again
old
useless
hinges
moan
whispers
three
french
soldiers
trying
to
find
their
homes
walk
over
the
bricks
and
groundsel
it
is
the
abomination
of
desolation
not
seen
by
prophecy
far
off
in
some
fabulous
future
nor
remembered
from
terrible
ages
by
the
aid
of
papyrus
and
stone
but
fallen
on
our
own
century
on
the
homes
of
folk
like
ourselves
common
things
that
we
knew
are
become
the
relics
of
bygone
days
it
is
our
own
time
that
has
ended
in
blood
and
broken
bricks
in
an
old
there
was
one
house
with
a
roof
on
it
in
peronne
and
there
an
officer
came
by
moonlight
on
his
way
back
from
leave
he
was
looking
for
his
battalion
which
had
moved
and
was
now
somewhere
in
the
desolation
out
in
front
of
peronne
or
else
was
marching
there
no
one
quite
knew
someone
said
he
had
seen
it
marching
through
tincourt
the
said
brie
those
who
did
not
know
were
always
ready
to
help
they
made
suggestions
and
even
pulled
out
maps
why
should
they
not
they
were
giving
away
no
secret
because
they
did
not
know
and
so
they
followed
a
soldier
natural
inclination
to
give
all
the
help
they
could
to
another
soldier
therefore
they
offered
their
suggestions
like
old
friends
they
had
never
met
before
might
never
meet
again
but
la
france
introduces
you
and
five
minute
acquaintance
in
a
place
like
peronne
where
things
may
change
so
profoundly
in
one
night
and
where
all
is
so
tense
by
the
strange
background
of
ruin
that
little
portions
of
time
seem
very
valuable
five
minutes
there
seem
quite
a
long
time
and
so
they
are
for
what
may
not
happen
in
five
minutes
any
day
now
in
france
five
minutes
may
be
a
page
of
history
a
chapter
even
perhaps
a
volume
little
children
with
inky
fingers
years
hence
may
sit
for
a
whole
hour
trying
to
learn
up
and
remember
just
what
happened
during
five
minutes
in
france
some
time
about
now
these
are
just
reflections
such
as
pass
through
the
mind
in
the
moonlight
among
vast
ruins
and
are
at
once
forgotten
those
that
knew
where
the
battalion
was
that
the
wandering
officer
looked
for
were
not
many
these
were
reserved
and
spoke
like
one
that
has
a
murder
on
his
conscience
not
freely
and
openly
for
of
one
thing
no
one
speaks
in
france
and
that
is
the
exact
position
of
a
unit
one
may
wave
one
hand
vaguely
eastwards
and
say
over
there
but
to
name
a
village
and
the
people
that
occupy
it
is
to
offend
against
the
silence
that
in
these
days
broods
over
france
the
solemn
hush
befitting
so
vast
a
tragedy
and
in
the
end
it
seemed
better
to
that
officer
to
obey
the
and
to
go
by
his
train
to
brie
that
left
in
the
morning
and
that
question
settled
there
remained
only
food
and
sleep
down
in
the
basement
of
the
big
house
with
a
roof
there
was
a
kitchen
in
fact
there
was
everything
that
a
house
should
have
and
the
more
that
one
saw
of
simple
household
things
tables
chairs
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
pieces
of
carpet
floors
ceilings
and
even
windows
the
more
one
wondered
it
did
not
seem
natural
in
peronne
picture
to
yourself
a
fine
with
high
ornamental
walls
and
all
the
air
about
it
of
dignity
peace
and
ease
that
were
so
recently
gone
only
just
as
it
might
have
been
stepped
through
the
double
doorway
skirts
as
it
were
of
ladies
only
just
trailed
out
of
sight
and
then
turn
in
fancy
to
that
great
town
streaming
with
moonlight
full
of
the
mystery
that
moonlight
always
brings
but
without
the
light
of
it
all
black
dark
as
caverns
of
earth
where
no
light
ever
came
blacker
for
the
moonlight
than
if
no
moon
were
there
sombre
mourning
and
accursed
each
house
in
the
great
streets
sheltering
darkness
amongst
its
windowless
walls
as
though
it
nursed
disaster
having
no
other
children
left
and
would
not
let
the
moon
peer
in
on
its
grief
or
see
the
monstrous
orphan
that
it
fondled
in
the
old
with
twenty
others
the
wandering
officer
lay
down
to
sleep
on
the
floor
and
thought
of
old
wars
that
came
to
the
cities
of
france
a
long
while
ago
to
just
such
houses
as
this
he
thought
men
must
have
come
before
and
gone
on
next
day
to
fight
in
other
centuries
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
have
been
more
romantic
then
who
knows
he
had
a
bit
of
carpet
to
lie
on
a
few
more
officers
came
in
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
and
talked
a
little
and
lay
down
a
few
candles
were
stuck
on
tables
here
and
there
midnight
would
have
struck
from
the
towers
had
any
clock
been
left
to
strike
in
peronne
still
talk
went
on
in
low
voices
here
and
there
the
candles
burned
low
and
were
fewer
big
shadows
floated
along
those
old
high
walls
then
the
talk
ceased
and
everyone
was
still
nothing
stirred
but
the
shadows
an
officer
muttered
in
sleep
of
things
far
thence
and
was
silent
far
away
shells
thumped
faintly
the
shadows
left
to
themselves
went
round
and
round
the
room
searching
in
every
corner
for
something
that
was
lost
over
walls
and
ceiling
they
went
and
could
not
find
it
the
last
candle
was
failing
it
flared
and
guttered
the
shadows
raced
over
the
room
from
comer
to
corner
lost
and
they
could
not
find
it
they
hurried
desperately
in
those
last
few
moments
great
shadows
searching
for
some
little
thing
in
the
smallest
nook
they
sought
for
it
then
the
last
candle
died
as
the
flame
went
up
with
the
smoke
from
the
fallen
wick
all
the
great
shadows
turned
and
mournfully
trailed
away
the
homes
of
arras
as
you
come
to
arras
by
the
western
road
by
the
red
ramparts
and
the
spanish
gate
arras
looks
like
a
king
with
such
a
dignity
as
clings
to
the
ancient
gateway
so
might
a
king
be
crowned
with
such
a
sweep
of
dull
red
as
the
old
ramparts
show
so
might
he
be
robed
but
a
dead
king
with
crowned
skull
for
the
ways
of
arras
are
empty
but
for
brown
soldiers
and
her
houses
are
bare
as
bones
arras
sleeps
profoundly
roofless
windowless
carpetless
arras
sleeps
as
a
skeleton
sleeps
with
all
the
dignity
of
former
days
about
it
but
the
life
that
stirs
in
its
streets
is
not
the
old
city
life
the
old
city
is
murdered
i
came
to
arras
and
went
down
a
street
and
saw
back
gardens
glinting
through
the
bare
ribs
of
the
houses
garden
after
garden
shone
so
far
as
it
could
though
it
was
in
october
and
after
four
years
of
war
but
what
was
left
of
those
gardens
shining
there
in
the
sun
was
like
sad
faces
trying
to
smile
after
many
disasters
i
came
to
a
great
wall
that
no
shell
had
breached
a
cascade
of
scarlet
creeper
poured
over
it
as
though
on
the
other
side
some
serene
garden
grew
where
no
disaster
came
tended
by
girls
who
had
never
heard
of
war
walking
untrodden
paths
it
was
not
so
but
fancy
weary
of
ruin
readily
turns
to
such
scenes
wherever
facts
are
hidden
though
but
by
a
tottering
wall
led
by
a
few
bright
leaves
or
the
glimpse
of
a
flower
but
not
for
any
fancy
of
mine
must
you
picture
ruin
any
more
as
something
graced
with
splendour
or
as
it
were
an
argosy
reaching
the
shores
of
our
day
laden
with
grandeur
and
dignity
out
of
antiquity
ruin
is
not
covered
with
ivy
and
has
no
curious
architecture
or
strange
secrets
of
history
and
is
not
beautiful
or
romantic
at
all
it
has
no
tale
to
tell
of
old
civilizations
not
otherwise
known
told
of
by
few
grey
stones
ruin
is
destruction
and
sorrow
and
debt
and
loss
come
down
untidily
upon
modern
homes
and
cutting
off
ordinary
generations
smashing
the
implements
of
familiar
trades
and
making
common
avocations
obsolete
it
is
no
longer
the
guardian
and
the
chronicle
of
ages
that
we
should
otherwise
forget
ruin
is
an
age
heaped
up
in
rubble
around
us
before
it
has
ceased
to
be
still
green
in
our
memory
quite
ordinary
wardrobes
in
unseemly
attitudes
gape
out
from
bedrooms
whose
front
walls
are
gone
in
houses
whose
most
inner
design
shows
unconcealed
to
the
cold
gaze
of
the
street
the
rooms
have
neither
mystery
nor
adornment
burst
mattresses
loll
down
from
bedraggled
beds
no
one
has
come
to
tidy
them
up
for
years
and
roofs
have
slanted
down
as
low
as
the
first
floor
i
saw
a
green
door
ajar
in
an
upper
room
the
whole
of
the
front
wall
of
the
house
was
gone
the
door
partly
opened
oddly
on
to
a
little
staircase
whose
steps
one
could
just
see
that
one
wondered
whither
it
went
the
door
seemed
to
beckon
and
beckon
to
some
lost
room
but
if
one
could
ever
have
got
there
up
through
that
shattered
house
and
if
the
steps
of
that
little
staircase
would
bear
so
that
one
came
to
the
room
that
is
hidden
away
at
the
top
yet
there
could
only
be
silence
and
spiders
there
and
broken
plaster
and
the
dust
of
calamity
it
is
only
to
memories
that
the
green
door
beckons
nothing
remains
and
some
day
they
may
come
to
arras
to
see
the
romance
of
war
to
see
where
the
shells
struck
and
to
pick
up
pieces
of
iron
it
is
not
this
that
is
romantic
not
mars
but
poor
limping
peace
it
is
what
is
left
that
appeals
to
you
with
pathos
and
infinite
charm
little
desolate
gardens
that
no
one
has
tended
for
years
left
in
forlorn
rooms
when
all
else
is
scattered
old
toys
buried
in
rubbish
old
steps
untrodden
on
inaccessible
landings
it
is
what
is
left
that
appeals
to
you
what
remains
of
old
peaceful
things
the
great
guns
throb
on
all
round
is
the
panoply
of
war
if
panoply
be
the
right
word
for
this
vast
disaster
that
is
known
to
arras
as
innumerable
separate
sorrows
but
it
is
not
to
this
great
event
sympathy
turns
in
arras
nor
to
its
thunder
and
show
nor
the
trappings
of
it
guns
lorries
and
fragments
of
shells
it
is
to
the
voiceless
deserted
inanimate
things
so
greatly
wronged
that
all
the
heart
goes
out
floors
fallen
in
festoons
windows
that
seem
to
be
wailing
roofs
as
though
crazed
with
grief
and
then
petrified
in
their
craziness
railings
sticks
all
hit
nothing
spared
by
that
frenzied
iron
the
very
earth
clawed
it
is
what
is
left
that
appeals
to
you
as
i
went
from
arras
i
passed
by
a
grey
gaunt
shape
the
ghost
of
a
railway
station
standing
in
the
wilderness
haunting
a
waste
of
weeds
and
mourning
as
it
seemed
over
rusted
railway
lines
lying
idle
and
purposeless
as
though
leading
nowhere
as
though
all
roads
had
ceased
and
all
lands
were
deserted
and
all
travellers
dead
sorrowful
and
lonely
that
ghostly
shape
stood
dumb
in
the
desolation
among
houses
whose
doors
were
shut
and
their
windows
broken
and
in
all
that
stricken
assembly
no
voice
spoke
but
the
sound
of
iron
tapping
on
broken
things
which
was
dumb
awhile
when
the
wind
dropped
the
wind
rose
and
it
tapped
again
