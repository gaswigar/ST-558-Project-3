introduction
once
in
an
ancient
city
raised
aloft
on
a
column
a
brazen
statue
of
justice
stood
in
the
public
square
upholding
the
scales
in
its
left
hand
and
in
its
right
hand
a
sword
as
an
emblem
that
justice
presided
over
the
laws
of
the
land
and
the
hearts
and
the
homes
of
the
people
but
in
the
course
of
time
the
laws
of
the
land
were
corrupted
might
took
the
place
of
right
and
the
weak
were
oppressed
and
the
mighty
ruled
with
an
iron
queen
anne
war
was
brought
to
a
close
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
in
by
this
treaty
the
french
province
nova
scotia
was
ceded
by
france
to
england
and
of
course
the
inhabitants
nearly
exclusively
french
and
numbering
some
three
thousand
became
subjects
of
great
britain
less
than
half
a
century
later
when
the
french
and
indian
war
broke
out
the
french
population
had
increased
to
eighteen
thousand
outnumbering
the
english
three
to
one
in
fact
the
presence
of
the
english
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
a
military
occupation
of
the
peninsula
these
french
peasants
usually
called
acadians
had
brought
under
cultivation
large
tracts
of
land
owned
about
sixty
thousand
head
of
cattle
had
built
neat
cottage
homes
established
peaceful
hamlets
and
lived
in
a
state
of
plenty
but
great
simplicity
they
were
reputed
to
be
a
peaceable
industrious
and
amiable
race
governed
mostly
by
their
pastors
who
exercised
a
paternal
authority
over
them
thus
dwelt
together
in
love
these
simple
acadian
farmers
dwelt
in
the
love
of
god
and
of
man
alike
were
they
free
from
fear
that
reigns
with
the
tyrant
and
envy
the
vice
of
republics
neither
locks
had
they
to
their
doors
nor
bars
to
their
windows
but
their
dwellings
were
open
as
day
and
the
hearts
of
their
owners
there
the
richest
were
poor
and
the
poorest
lived
in
abundance
when
the
french
and
indian
war
broke
out
these
people
were
quietly
cultivating
their
farms
and
manifested
no
warlike
disposition
still
the
deputy
governor
of
the
province
lawrence
by
name
pretended
to
fear
an
insurrection
should
the
french
in
canada
attempt
an
invasion
of
acadia
therefore
when
general
braddock
met
in
council
with
the
colonial
governors
at
alexandria
lawrence
urged
the
assembly
to
do
something
to
overawe
the
french
and
strengthen
the
english
authority
a
plan
to
humiliate
the
acadians
was
decided
upon
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
infamous
deputy
governor
lawrence
and
colonel
monckton
to
execute
a
fleet
of
forty
vessels
with
three
thousand
regular
troops
on
board
left
boston
in
may
and
after
a
successful
voyage
anchored
in
chignecto
bay
landing
their
troops
they
besieged
fort
which
had
been
erected
by
the
french
on
the
isthmus
connecting
nova
scotia
with
new
brunswick
after
a
feeble
resistance
the
fort
capitulated
and
in
less
than
a
month
with
the
loss
of
only
twenty
men
the
english
had
made
themselves
masters
of
the
whole
country
the
inglorious
campaign
was
ended
but
the
fact
still
existed
that
the
obnoxious
acadians
outnumbered
the
english
and
the
question
remained
as
it
was
before
the
invasion
the
deputy
governor
convened
a
council
to
consider
what
disposal
of
the
acadians
the
security
of
the
country
required
the
result
of
the
deliberations
was
this
the
security
of
the
country
required
the
banishment
of
the
entire
french
population
lawrence
and
his
associates
soon
invented
a
scheme
which
furnished
an
excuse
for
carrying
into
effect
this
infamous
order
an
oath
of
allegiance
was
formulated
to
which
the
acadians
as
consistent
catholics
could
not
subscribe
without
doing
violence
to
their
consciences
they
refused
to
take
the
oath
but
declared
their
loyalty
to
the
english
government
this
they
were
told
was
insufficient
at
one
fell
stroke
they
were
adjudged
guilty
of
treason
and
the
surrender
of
their
boats
and
firearms
demanded
to
these
acts
of
tyranny
the
acadians
submitted
they
even
offered
to
take
the
oath
first
required
of
them
but
the
deputy
governor
said
the
day
of
grace
was
past
that
once
having
refused
to
take
it
they
must
now
endure
the
consequences
their
lands
houses
and
cattle
were
declared
forfeited
their
peaceful
hamlets
were
laid
waste
their
houses
given
to
the
flames
the
fruits
of
years
of
honest
industry
and
strict
economy
were
wantonly
destroyed
and
the
people
driven
to
the
larger
coast
towns
in
one
district
two
hundred
and
houses
were
burned
to
the
ground
at
once
part
of
the
inhabitants
who
had
escaped
to
the
woods
beheld
all
they
possessed
wickedly
destroyed
by
bands
of
marauders
without
making
any
resistance
until
their
place
of
worship
was
wantonly
set
on
fire
exasperated
by
this
unhallowed
deed
they
rushed
from
their
hiding
places
killed
about
thirty
of
the
incendiaries
and
retreated
to
the
woods
to
render
this
scheme
of
tyrannical
banishment
completely
effective
further
treachery
was
necessary
in
each
district
the
people
were
commanded
to
meet
at
a
certain
place
and
day
on
important
business
the
nature
of
which
was
carefully
concealed
from
them
until
they
were
assembled
and
surrounded
by
english
troops
then
the
inhuman
edict
of
banishment
was
announced
to
the
peasants
very
little
time
was
allowed
them
for
preparation
in
mournful
crowds
they
were
driven
to
the
beach
women
with
white
faces
pressed
their
babes
to
their
hearts
children
dumb
with
terror
clung
to
their
parents
the
aged
and
the
infirm
as
well
as
the
young
and
strong
shared
the
common
fate
at
the
large
village
of
grand
pre
when
the
moment
for
embarkation
arrived
the
young
men
who
were
placed
in
the
front
refused
to
move
but
files
of
troops
with
fixed
bayonets
forced
obedience
as
soon
as
they
were
on
board
the
british
shipping
heavy
columns
of
black
smoke
ascending
from
grand
pre
announced
to
the
wretched
acadians
the
destruction
of
their
lovely
village
the
embarkation
of
these
peasants
and
the
burning
of
grand
pre
is
thus
described
by
longfellow
thus
to
the
gaspereau
mouth
moved
on
that
mournful
procession
there
disorder
prevailed
and
the
tumult
and
stir
of
embarking
busily
plied
the
freighted
boats
and
in
the
confusion
wives
were
torn
from
their
husbands
and
mothers
too
late
saw
their
children
left
on
the
land
extending
their
arms
with
wildest
entreaties
suddenly
rose
from
the
south
a
light
as
in
autumn
the
blood
red
moon
climbs
the
crystal
walls
of
heaven
and
the
horizon
stretches
its
hundred
hands
upon
mountain
and
meadow
seizing
the
rocks
and
the
rivers
and
piling
huge
shadows
together
broader
and
ever
broader
it
gleamed
on
the
roofs
of
the
village
gleamed
on
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
the
ships
that
lie
in
the
road
stead
columns
of
shining
smoke
uprose
and
flashes
of
flame
were
thrust
through
their
folds
and
withdrawn
like
the
quivering
hands
of
a
martyr
then
as
the
winds
seized
the
gleeds
and
the
burning
thatch
and
uplifting
whirled
them
aloft
through
the
air
at
once
from
a
hundred
housetops
started
the
sheeted
smoke
with
flashes
of
flame
intermingled
these
things
beheld
in
dismay
the
crowd
on
the
shore
and
on
shipboard
speechless
at
first
they
stood
then
cried
aloud
in
their
anguish
shall
behold
no
more
our
homes
in
the
village
of
grand
the
property
which
had
before
escaped
the
hands
of
the
spoilers
was
now
laid
waste
on
the
plea
of
discouraging
the
return
of
the
exiles
who
through
their
blinding
tears
saw
the
land
of
their
homes
and
their
hopes
fade
from
view
no
preparations
had
been
made
for
their
settlement
elsewhere
nor
did
they
receive
any
compensation
for
their
property
from
which
they
were
forced
or
that
had
been
wickedly
destroyed
in
a
starving
and
penniless
state
they
were
put
ashore
in
small
groups
at
different
points
along
the
coast
of
new
england
where
many
of
them
perished
through
the
hardships
they
endured
a
pathetic
representation
of
their
wrongs
was
addressed
to
the
english
government
and
by
reference
to
solemn
treaties
made
between
them
and
the
provincial
government
they
proved
their
banishment
to
be
as
faithless
as
it
was
cruel
no
attention
however
says
marcus
wilson
was
paid
to
this
document
and
so
guarded
a
silence
was
preserved
by
the
government
of
nova
scotia
upon
the
subject
of
the
removal
of
the
acadians
that
the
records
of
the
province
make
no
allusion
whatever
to
the
event
after
the
close
of
the
french
and
indian
war
france
ceded
all
her
possessions
in
canada
to
victorious
england
the
case
of
the
acadians
was
again
brought
before
the
english
government
but
no
compensation
was
ever
allowed
them
for
the
outrages
committed
against
them
the
property
of
which
they
were
ruthlessly
plundered
was
never
restored
they
were
allowed
to
return
to
the
province
and
on
taking
the
customary
oaths
could
receive
lands
but
of
the
eighteen
thousand
that
were
banished
less
than
two
thousand
returned
still
stands
the
forest
primeval
but
under
the
shade
of
its
branches
dwells
another
race
with
other
customs
and
language
only
along
the
shore
of
the
mournful
and
misty
atlantic
linger
a
few
acadian
peasants
whose
fathers
from
exile
wandered
back
to
their
native
land
to
die
in
its
bosom
for
such
atrocious
acts
as
these
we
find
no
apologist
among
our
historians
on
every
hand
they
meet
with
execration
such
wanton
cruelty
such
palpable
violations
of
human
rights
are
stains
upon
the
escutcheon
of
the
nation
that
permits
them
to
be
perpetrated
within
her
borders
it
is
quite
generally
supposed
that
such
atrocious
crimes
as
this
against
the
french
peasants
of
acadia
are
only
to
be
met
with
in
former
ages
or
among
countries
but
in
writing
the
history
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
strange
as
it
may
appear
and
almost
past
believing
it
is
my
task
to
relate
events
which
have
taken
place
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
this
age
of
boasted
enlightenment
and
toleration
that
shall
make
the
expulsion
of
the
french
peasants
from
acadia
pale
in
comparison
with
them
events
which
have
occurred
in
the
united
states
the
boasted
asylum
for
the
oppressed
of
all
nations
events
which
would
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
intolerance
of
the
dark
ages
and
the
cruelty
of
spain
during
the
reign
of
the
inquisition
than
in
this
age
and
in
this
nation
what
events
are
these
that
so
thunder
in
the
index
such
deeds
as
outrage
humanity
and
destroy
one
confidence
in
human
governments
mock
justice
deride
the
claims
of
mercy
and
pull
down
the
wrath
of
an
offended
god
upon
the
people
who
perform
them
and
upon
the
government
which
allows
them
to
go
unwhipped
of
justice
listen
to
the
history
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
chapter
nauvoo
the
history
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
is
worthy
the
attention
of
the
readers
of
this
book
because
its
story
is
connected
with
one
of
the
most
important
religious
movements
of
this
or
any
other
age
and
with
the
life
and
death
of
one
of
the
world
greatest
and
most
unique
characters
the
prophet
joseph
smith
it
is
worthy
of
the
attention
because
the
religious
institution
founded
under
god
by
this
man
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
survives
him
and
presents
to
the
world
the
greatest
religious
wonder
of
the
age
a
right
conception
of
which
can
not
be
formed
without
a
knowledge
of
this
nauvoo
period
of
the
history
of
the
church
a
period
which
is
essentially
a
formative
one
especially
in
regard
to
what
may
be
considered
the
higher
and
more
complex
doctrines
of
mormonism
it
was
in
nauvoo
that
joseph
smith
reached
the
summit
of
his
remarkable
career
it
was
in
nauvoo
he
grew
bolder
in
the
proclamation
of
those
doctrines
which
stamp
mormonism
as
the
great
religion
of
the
age
it
was
in
nauvoo
that
joseph
smith
life
expanded
into
that
eloquent
fullness
which
gives
so
much
promise
of
what
that
man
will
be
in
eternity
it
was
in
nauvoo
he
contended
against
a
world
of
opposition
against
the
power
of
falsehood
and
misrepresentation
against
priestcraft
against
corruption
in
high
places
from
here
he
corresponded
with
statesman
and
rebuked
demagogues
from
here
he
went
to
martyrdom
to
seal
his
testimony
with
his
blood
and
after
his
death
it
was
from
here
his
people
fled
to
the
wilderness
in
the
most
remarkable
exodus
of
modern
times
the
church
fled
into
the
wilderness
not
however
to
be
hidden
from
the
world
but
to
be
lifted
up
on
high
as
an
ensign
to
the
nations
to
be
as
a
city
sitting
upon
a
hill
that
can
not
be
hid
but
on
the
contrary
from
its
lofty
eminence
challenges
the
attention
of
the
world
in
illinois
as
in
missouri
the
religious
toleration
guaranteed
in
the
constitutions
of
both
the
state
of
illinois
and
of
the
united
states
religious
toleration
at
once
the
boast
and
pride
of
americans
and
also
the
test
of
true
enlightenment
and
the
highest
civilization
this
vaunted
toleration
was
in
nauvoo
put
to
the
test
and
found
wanting
that
is
before
the
exodus
of
the
church
from
nauvoo
it
became
evident
that
a
people
accepting
what
to
their
neighbors
was
a
singular
faith
and
one
that
was
unpopular
withal
could
not
live
in
peace
among
their
of
other
faiths
and
hence
the
exodus
not
only
from
nauvoo
but
from
the
entire
state
of
illinois
and
also
from
the
united
states
the
saints
in
a
word
were
expatriated
from
the
united
states
and
sought
an
asylum
in
the
wilderness
and
among
tribes
of
savages
from
whence
after
half
a
century
that
same
church
emerges
enlarged
prosperous
more
firmly
rooted
in
safety
and
in
strength
of
faith
than
ever
before
a
greater
enigma
to
the
religious
world
than
when
it
made
its
exodus
from
illinois
all
these
things
have
a
relation
to
nauvoo
for
the
church
had
a
sort
of
second
birth
there
which
makes
the
rise
and
fall
of
nauvoo
a
theme
of
peculiar
interest
to
those
interested
in
what
the
world
calls
mormonism
and
who
is
not
or
should
not
be
interested
in
a
religious
movement
of
such
proportions
of
such
pretensions
and
of
such
achievements
in
the
face
of
such
opposition
as
it
has
met
nauvoo
then
its
rise
and
its
fall
is
to
be
the
subject
of
my
discourse
the
word
nauvoo
comes
from
the
hebrew
and
signifies
beautiful
situation
carrying
with
it
also
says
the
prophet
joseph
smith
the
idea
of
rest
and
indeed
the
location
of
the
city
is
beautiful
no
sooner
does
one
come
in
view
of
it
than
he
exclaims
it
is
rightly
named
the
city
or
at
least
the
marred
remains
of
it
stands
on
a
bold
point
around
which
sweeps
the
placid
yet
majestic
father
of
waters
the
mississippi
the
city
is
at
least
half
encircled
by
that
noble
stream
from
its
banks
the
ground
rises
gradually
for
at
least
a
mile
where
it
reaches
the
common
level
of
the
prairie
that
stretches
out
to
the
eastward
farther
than
the
eye
can
reach
in
a
beautifully
undulating
surface
once
covered
by
a
luxuriant
growth
of
natural
grasses
and
wild
flowers
with
here
and
there
patches
of
timber
but
now
chequered
with
meadows
and
at
the
time
of
my
visit
in
with
fields
of
waving
corn
opposite
nauvoo
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
the
bluffs
rise
rather
abruptly
almost
from
the
water
edge
and
are
covered
for
the
most
part
with
a
fine
growth
of
timber
nestling
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
highest
of
these
bluffs
and
immediately
on
the
bank
of
the
river
is
the
little
village
of
montrose
to
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
refer
in
these
pages
back
of
these
bluffs
before
mentioned
roll
off
the
alternate
prairie
and
woodlands
of
iowa
between
montrose
and
nauvoo
and
perhaps
two
thirds
of
the
distance
across
the
river
from
the
illinois
side
is
an
island
from
of
a
mile
to
a
mile
in
length
and
from
fifty
to
one
or
two
hundred
yards
in
width
having
its
greatest
extent
north
and
south
nauvoo
is
situated
just
at
the
head
of
what
are
usually
called
the
des
moines
rapids
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
miles
above
louis
these
rapids
were
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
navigation
of
the
mississippi
at
this
point
in
an
early
day
as
in
the
season
of
low
water
they
could
not
be
passed
by
the
steamboats
plying
the
river
this
difficulty
of
late
however
has
been
obviated
by
the
general
government
building
a
fine
canal
running
parallel
with
the
west
bank
of
the
river
from
keokuk
to
montrose
a
distance
of
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
i
was
unable
to
learn
the
cost
of
the
construction
but
judge
it
must
have
required
at
least
several
millions
of
dollars
such
is
the
location
of
nauvoo
such
its
immediate
surroundings
it
now
remains
for
me
to
relate
the
events
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
a
thriving
city
on
the
site
we
have
briefly
described
how
it
was
converted
from
a
sickly
wilderness
to
the
most
desirable
section
of
the
great
state
of
illinois
and
then
how
through
acts
of
injustice
and
treachery
some
of
its
principal
founders
were
murdered
and
the
rest
of
its
inhabitants
cruelly
driven
from
the
city
by
mob
violence
into
the
wilderness
and
how
the
city
sank
from
its
prosperous
condition
to
become
the
place
it
is
today
and
what
is
of
more
importance
to
trace
the
development
of
that
faith
taught
by
joseph
smith
which
is
destined
to
become
and
indeed
now
is
one
of
the
world

religions

the

in

is
properly
a

volume
to
this
the

persecutions
i
have
told
how
the
saints
were
driven
from
missouri
under
a
threat
of
extermination
from
the
executive
of
that
state
lilburn
boggs
when
fleeing
from
missouri
where
they
had
suffered
so
much
from
mob
violence
and
from
the
state
government
officials
the
mormon
exiles
crossed
the
mississippi
into
the
state
of
illinois
at
the
point
near
where
the
city
of
quincy
is
located
in
fact
at
the
quincy
ferry
their
destitute
condition
together
with
the
injustice
they
had
suffered
in
missouri
the
spectacle
of
a
people
in
free
america
being
driven
from
their
homes
and
exiled
from
one
of
the
states
of
the
american
union
because
of
religious
beliefs
aroused
the
indignation
and
excited
the
sympathy
of
the
people
of
quincy
and
vicinity
a
kind
reception
was
given
to
the
exiles
by
the
people
of
this
section
of
illinois
one
very
similar
to
that
given
to
many
of
the
same
people
by
the
inhabitants
of
clay
county
when
a
cruel
persecution
had
driven
some
twelve
hundred
of
them
from
their
homes
in
jackson
county
missouri
five
years
before
the
democratic
association
of
quincy
was
especially
active
in
the
interests
of
the
exiles
in
the
month
of
february
a
meeting
was
called
by
this
association
to
inquire
into
the
situation
of
the
mormon
exiles
at
this
first
meeting
all
that
was
done
was
to
pass
a
resolution
to
the
effect
that
the
people
called
saints
were
in
a
situation
requiring
the
aid
of
the
people
of
quincy
a
committee
of
eight
was
appointed
to
call
a
general
meeting
of
both
citizens
and
mormons
and
to
receive
a
statement
from
the
latter
of
their
condition
with
a
view
to
relieving
their
necessities
the
committee
was
instructed
to
get
the
congregational
church
in
which
to
hold
the
next
meeting
but
the
directors
having
in
charge
that
building
would
not
allow
it
to
be
used
for
that
purpose
i
speak
of
this
to
show
the
kind
of
charity
existing
in
the
breasts
of
some
pretended
followers
of
him
who
taught
that
charity
was
the
crowning
virtue
failing
to
secure
the
church
the
second
meeting
was
held
in
the
courthouse
at
this
meeting
the
special
committee
appointed
at
the
first
meeting
reported
its
labors
the
committee
had
received
statements
from
sidney
rigdon
and
others
in
relation
to
the
expulsion
of
the
mormons
from
missouri
and
suggested
a
series
of
resolutions
setting
forth
that
the
exiled
strangers
were
entitled
to
the
sympathy
and
aid
of
the
people
of
quincy
that
a
numerous
committee
composed
of
individuals
from
every
part
of
the
town
be
appointed
to
allay
the
prejudices
of
the
misguided
citizens
of
quincy
and
explain
that
it
was
not
the
design
of
the
exiled
saints
to
lower
the
wages
of
the
laboring
classes
but
to
secure
something
to
save
them
from
starvation
that
a
standing
committee
be
appointed
to
relieve
so
far
as
in
their
power
the
wants
of
the
destitute
and
homeless
and
to
use
their
utmost
endeavors
to
procure
employment
for
those
who
were
able
and
willing
to
labor
the
report
closed
by
saying
we
recommend
to
all
the
citizens
of
quincy
that
in
all
their
intercourse
with
the
strangers
they
use
and
observe
a
becoming
decorum
and
delicacy
and
be
particularly
careful
not
to
indulge
in
any
conversation
or
expression
calculated
to
wound
their
feelings
or
in
any
way
to
reflect
upon
those
who
by
every
law
of
humanity
are
entitled
to
our
sympathy
and
commiseration
this
good
work
begun
by
the
democratic
association
was
continued
by
them
and
substantial
assistance
was
given
to
the
suffering
saints
through
their
exertions
at
a
subsequent
meeting
of
the
association
the
following
resolutions
were
adopted
that
we
regard
the
right
of
conscience
as
natural
and
inalienable
and
the
most
sacredly
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
our
free
government
that
we
regard
the
acts
of
all
mobs
in
violation
of
law
and
those
who
compose
them
individually
responsible
both
to
the
laws
of
god
and
man
for
every
depredation
committed
upon
the
property
rights
or
life
of
any
citizen
that
the
inhabitants
upon
the
western
frontier
of
the
state
of
missouri
in
their
late
persecution
of
the
people
denominated
mormons
have
violated
the
sacred
rights
of
conscience
and
every
law
of
justice
and
humanity
that
the
governor
of
missouri
in
refusing
protection
to
this
class
of
people
when
pressed
upon
by
a
heartless
mob
and
turning
upon
them
a
band
of
unprincipled
militia
with
orders
encouraging
their
extermination
has
brought
a
lasting
disgrace
upon
the
state
over
which
he
presides
thus
with
expressions
of
sympathy
and
material
aid
did
the
people
of
quincy
assist
the
exiles
and
bid
them
hope
for
better
days
nor
was
this
kindly
feeling
confined
to
the
people
of
quincy
and
vicinity
it
extended
throughout
the
state
and
especially
was
it
exhibited
by
some
of
the
leading
men
thereof
including
governor
carlin

owned

and
he
wrote
the

that
several

in

that
perhaps
some

it

however
on

the

were
good

you
give
a
short
account
of
the

of
the

and
ask
whether
they
could
be

to
purchase

and
there
worship

according

etc
in
answer
to
your
inquiry
i
would
say
that
i
know
of
no
authority
that
can
constitutionally
deprive
them
of
this
right
they
are
citizens
of
the

and
are
entitled
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
other
citizens
the
section
of

of

all

declares
that
the

shall

the

shall
ever

in

these
principles
i
trust
will
ever
be
adhered

they
make
no

they

produced
thereby
with

i
know
but
little
they
had
a

in

for
several
years
and
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
having
heard
in
that
state
of
any
complaints
against
them
from
violating
the
laws
of
the

their

they

of
their
murderers
in
missouri
have
endeavored
to
heap
upon
them
you
are
respectfully
solicited
to
publish
it
in
the
the
testimony
of
governor
lucas
as
to
the
good
moral
character
of
these
people
i
think
will
have
its
deserved
influence
upon
the
people
of
illinois
in
encouraging
our
citizens
in
their
humane
and
benevolent
exertions
to
relieve
this
distressed
people
who
are
now
wandering
in
our
neighborhoods
without
comfortable
food
raiment
or
a
shelter
from
the
pelting
storm
i
am
gentlemen
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
isaac
galland
in
conversation
with
galland
isaac
van
allen
for
the
same
territory
iowa
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
would
so
far
as
within
his
power
protect
the
mormon
people
from
insult
and
injury
it
was
these
assurances
of
sympathy
and
protection
which
led
to
a
reconsideration
of
the
conclusion
of
the
former
conference
and
the
appointment
of
a
committee
to
examine
the
lands
offered
but
little
or
nothing
was
ever
done
by
this
committee
on
the
of
april
the
prophet
joseph
joined
the
exiled
saints
at
quincy
after
a
cruel
imprisonment
of
over
five
months
he
had
escaped
from
his
persecutors
while
en
route
from
liberty
prison
clay
county
to
columbia
boone
county
to
which
he
and
his
companions
in
prison
had
taken
a
change
of
venue
for
trial
the
guards
got
drunk
and
were
evidently
willing
for
their
prisoners
to
escape
at
any
rate
the
prophet
in
stating
the
circumstance
in
his
history
says
we
thought
it
a
favorable
opportunity
to
make
our
escape
knowing
that
the
only
object
of
our
enemies
was
our
destruction
and
likewise
knowing
that
a
number
of
our
brethren
had
been
massacred
by
them
on
shoal
creek
amongst
whom
were
two
children
and
they
had
sought
every
opportunity
to
abuse
others
who
were
left
in
the
state
and
that
they
were
never
brought
to
an
account
for
their
barbarous
proceedings
but
were
winked
at
and
encouraged
by
those
in
authority
we
thought
that
it
was
necessary
for
us
inasmuch
as
we
loved
our
lives
and
did
not
wish
to
die
by
the
hand
of
murderers
and
assassins
and
inasmuch
as
we
loved
our
families
and
friends
to
deliver
ourselves
from
our
enemies
and
so
the
prophet
and
his
companions
escaped
and
arrived
in
quincy
as
already
stated
i
need
not
stop
to
undertake
a
description
of
the
scenes
of
this
exiled
people
welcoming
their
youthful
prophet
into
their
midst
after
such
trials
as
they
had
passed
through
in
which
the
strength
of
each
man
soul
and
love
for
his
brethren
had
been
tested
the
saints
had
seen
their
prophet
and
his
fellow
prisoners
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
a
merciless
enemy
and
knew
that
a
of
the
missouri
state
militia
had
condemned
him
and
his
companions
to
be
shot
in
the
public
square
at
far
west
they
had
seen
him
and
his
torn
away
from
their
parents
and
families
and
their
people
under
circumstances
the
most
distressing
they
had
been
told
by
the
haughty
of
the
mob
militia
forces
which
invested
far
west
general
clark
that
the
doom
of
their
leaders
was
sealed
and
they
need
not
expect
nor
even
let
it
enter
into
their
hearts
that
they
would
be
permitted
to
see
them
again
many
of
them
had
seen
him
chained
like
a
felon
standing
before
unjust
judges
whose
hearts
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
hatred
towards
him
contrary
to
every
principle
of
justice
he
had
been
sent
to
languish
in
prison
in
the
midst
of
his
enemies
while
they
themselves
with
bursting
hearts
and
blinding
tears
were
compelled
to
sign
away
their
lands
and
homes
at
the
muzzle
of
the
musket
and
flee
from
the
christian
state
of
missouri
under
the
exterminating
order
issued
by
governor
boggs
yet
in
all
these
trials
from
the
dangers
of
the
murderous
militia
camps
from
the
malice
of
corrupt
courts
and
the
injustice
of
drunken
juries
and
at
last
from
the
prison
gloom
a
kind
providence
had
delivered
him
and
he
was
again
in
their
midst
again
with
them
to
still
their
fears
and
direct
their
movements
his
presence
was
the
signal
for
action
he
arrived
in
quincy
on
the
of
april
the
day
following
he
spent
in
greeting
his
friends
and
receiving
visits
from
the
brethren
but
on
the
he
called
and
presided
over
a
conference
at
which
in
connection
with
bishop
knight
and
alanson
ripley
he
was
appointed
to
go
to
iowa
to
select
a
place
for
the
gathering
of
the
exiled
saints
the
conference
also
advised
the
brethren
who
could
do
so
to
go
to
commerce
and
locate
in
galland
neighborhood
on
the
first
of
may
the
committee
purchased
a
farm
of
one
hundred
and
acres
for
which
they
agreed
to
pay
five
thousand
dollars
also
another
and
a
larger
farm
of
galland
for
nine
thousand
dollars
the
committee
desired
that
these
farms
should
be
deeded
to
alanson
ripley
but
sidney
rigdon
manifesting
a
rather
sour
disposition
said
that
no
committee
should
control
any
property
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
so
the
purchase
made
of
galland
was
deeded
to
sidney
rigdon
robinson
with
the
understanding
that
he
should
deed
it
to
the
church
as
soon
as
it
was
paid
for
according
to
the
contract
this
was
the
first
purchase
of
lands
made
in
commerce
the
place
is
thus
described
by
joseph
when
i
made
the
purchase
of
white
and
galland
there
was
one
stone
house
three
frame
houses
and
two
blockhouses
which
constituted
the
whole
city
of
commerce
this
small
collection
of
houses
was
immediately
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
scattered
between
them
and
what
afterwards
became
the
south
part
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
were
one
stone
and
three
log
houses
it
was
one
of
these
humble
dwellings
that
joseph
moved
into
on
the
tenth
of
may
back
some
distance
from
the
river
however
were
other
dwellings
scattered
over
the
country
one
of
which
was
the
home
of
daniel
wells
a
justice
of
the
peace
for
the
district
of
commerce
and
who
afterwards
became
a
prominent
church
leader
one
of
the
counselors
in
fact
in
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
later
when
referring
to
the
purchase
of
lands
about
commerce
the
prophet
joseph
said
the
place
was
literally
a
wilderness
the
land
was
mostly
covered
with
trees
and
bushes
and
much
of
it
was
so
wet
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
a
footman
could
get
through
and
totally
impossible
for
teams
commerce
was
unhealthy
very
few
could
live
there
but
believing
that
it
might
become
a
healthy
place
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
to
the
saints
and
no
more
eligible
place
presenting
itself
i
considered
it
wisdom
to
make
an
attempt
to
build
up
a
city
having
spoken
of
the
first
purchase
of
lands
at
commerce
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
say
that
subsequently
more
extensive
purchases
were
made
of
galland
and
hubbard
wells
hotchkiss
and
others
considerable
difficulty
and
embarrassment
to
joseph
personally
and
to
the
church
in
general
arose
over
misunderstandings
about
the
hotchkiss
land
purchase
hotchkiss
sold
to
joseph
for
the
church
upwards
of
five
hundred
acres
of
land
in
commerce
for
which
he
was
to
receive
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
half
to
be
paid
in
ten
years
and
the
remainder
in
twenty
years
this
amount
was
secured
to
hotchkiss
company
by
two
notes
one
payable
in
ten
years
and
the
other
in
twenty
signed
by
joseph
smith
hyrum
smith
and
sidney
rigdon
the
difficulty
connected
with
this
extensive
land
purchase
arose
from
some
exchanges
that
were
made
of
property
in
the
east
by
some
of
the
saints
for
its
equivalent
in
value
in
land
out
of
the
hotchkiss
purchase
in
commerce
the
matter
however
was
finally
amicably
settled
the
terms
on
which
galland
let
the
church
have
lands
were
extremely
advantageous
to
the
saints
he
sold
at
a
reasonable
rate
and
on
long
credit
that
the
people
might
not
be
distressed
in
paying
for
the
inheritance
they
purchased
in
addition
to
the
first
purchase
he
exchanged
lands
with
the
saints
in
the
vicinity
of
commerce
for
lands
in
missouri
to
the
value
of
eighty
thousand
dollars
and
he
gave
them
a
good
title
to
the
same
he
is
described
as
a
man
of
literary
attainments
and
extensive
information
and
influence
all
of
which
he
used
for
the
good
of
the
exiled
saints
in
giving
them
a
standing
among
his
friends
finally
he
joined
the
church
thus
casting
his
lot
with
the
exiled
people
he
had
assisted
and
from
that
time
until
his
death
partook
of
their
joys
and
their
sorrows
shared
their
fortunes
and
reverses
in
addition
to
these
land
purchases
the
church
made
others
some
of
them
even
more
extensive
than
those
already
mentioned
the
village
of
nashville
in
lee
county
iowa
and
twenty
thousand
acres
of
land
adjoining
was
bought
though
upon
what
terms
the
purchase
was
made
can
not
be
learned
another
purchase
also
in
iowa
was
made
by
bishop
knight
and
a
settlement
was
started
there
called
zarahemla
which
was
opposite
nauvoo
this
place
was
organized
into
a
stake
of
zion
but
in
january
the
stake
organization
was
discontinued
though
zarahemla
continued
as
an
organized
branch
of
the
church
stakes
of
zion
in
the
following
year
were
organized
at
lima
in
illinois
also
at
quincy
in
adams
county
for
the
benefit
of
the
saints
who
continued
there
another
stake
was
organized
at
columbus
in
adams
county
illinois
known
as
mount
hope
stake
besides
these
stakes
branches
of
the
church
were
organized
in
various
parts
of
lee
county
iowa
and
adams
and
hancock
counties
illinois
but
as
nauvoo
rose
from
the
swamps
and
underbrush
of
commerce
and
under
the
industry
and
enterprise
of
the
saints
and
the
blessings
of
a
kindly
disposed
providence
developed
into
a
healthy
beautiful
and
prosperous
commercial
and
manufacturing
city
these
stake
organizations
in
the
surrounding
country
were
discontinued
and
nauvoo
became
the
one
great
gathering
place
of
the
saints
footnotes
a

a

chapter
iv
as
flies
in
the
ointment
having
described
the
site
of
nauvoo
and
related
the
circumstances
connected
with
its
establishment
as
a
gathering
place
of
the
saints
it
is
necessary
to
return
to
the
consideration
of
some
events
which
occurred
at
quincy
during
the
sojourn
of
the
saints
at
that
place
paul
in
his
day
told
the
hebrews
that
all
were
not
israel
that
were
of
israel
so
all
were
not
saints
that
flocked
into
quincy
with
the
exiles
from
missouri
many
of
them
were
altogether
unworthy
of
the
association
of
the
people
of
god
these
preyed
upon
the
hospitality
of
the
people
of
quincy
to
such
an
extent
that
the
church
by
action
of
a
conference
authorized
elder
john
taylor
then
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
and
who
afterwards
became
president
of
the
church
to
write
the
following
letter
which
was
printed
in
the
quincy
in
consequence
of
so
great
an
influx
of
strangers
arriving
in
this
place
daily
owing
to
their
late
expulsion
from
the
state
of
missouri
there
must
of
necessity
be
and
we
wish
to
state
to
the
citizens
of
quincy
and
the
vicinity
through
the
medium
of
your
columns
that
there
are
many
individuals
among
the
numbers
who
have
already
arrived
as
well
as
among
those
who
are
now
on
their
way
here
who
never
did
belong
to
our
church
and
others
who
once
did
but
who
for
various
reasons
have
been
expelled
from
our
fellowship
among
these
are
some
who
have
contracted
habits
which
are
at
variance
with
principles
of
moral
rectitude
such
as
swearing
which
immoralities
the
church
of
saints
is
liable
to
be
charged
with
owing
to
our
amalgamation
under
our
late
existing
circumstances
and
as
we
as
a
people
do
not
wish
to
lay
under
any
such
imputation
we
would
also
state
that
such
individuals
do
not
hold
a
name
or
a
place
amongst
us
that
we
altogether
discountenance
everything
of
the
kind
that
every
person
once
belonging
to
our
community
contracting
or
persisting
in
such
immoral
habits
have
hitherto
been
expelled
from
our
society
and
that
such
as
we
may
hereafter
be
informed
of
we
will
hold
no
communion
with
but
will
withdraw
our
fellowship
from
them
we
wish
further
to
state
that
we
feel
laid
under
peculiar
obligations
to
the
citizens
of
this
place
for
the
patriotic
feelings
which
have
been
manifested
and
for
the
hand
of
liberality
and
friendship
which
was
extended
to
us
in
our
late
difficulties
and
should
feel
sorry
to
see
that
philanthropy
and
benevolence
abused
by
the
wicked
and
designing
people
who
under
pretense
of
poverty
and
distress
should
try
to
work
up
the
feelings
of
the
charitable
and
humane
get
into
their
debt
without
any
prospect
or
intention
of
paying
and
finally
perhaps
we
as
a
people
be
charged
with
dishonesty
we
say
that
we
altogether
disapprove
of
such
practices
and
we
warn
the
citizens
of
quincy
against
such
individuals
who
may
pretend
to
belong
to
our
community
i
have
given
this
letter
because
it
bears
upon
its
face
the
evidence
of
the
honesty
of
the
church
and
its
disposition
to
treat
the
people
of
illinois
who
had
so
nobly
and
kindly
received
its
members
in
the
days
of
their
distress
with
candor
it
also
tells
us
of
a
class
even
then
in
the
church
who
by
the
vileness
of
their
lives
gave
some
coloring
to
the
charges
subsequently
so
unjustly
made
against
the
whole
church
a
class
who
brought
upon
the
church
reproach
an
unrighteous
apostate
element
which
lingered
with
the
church
for
the
sake
of
advantage
the
bane
of
the
body
religious
chapter
political
agitation
about
this
time
too
the
good
feeling
entertained
toward
the
saints
by
the
people
of
quincy
and
vicinity
was
not
a
little
endangered
through
the
unwise
course
of
lyman
wight
he
began
the
publication
of
a
series
of
letters
in
the
quincy
in
which
he
laid
the
responsibility
of
the
outrages
perpetrated
against
the
saints
in
missouri
upon
the
democratic
party
implicating
not
only
the
democrats
of
missouri
but
indirectly
the
national
democratic
party
this
gave
much
dissatisfaction
to
members
of
that
party
in
the
vicinity
of
quincy
a
number
of
whom
had
been
very
active
in
assisting
the
saints
and
some
of
the
leading
men
approached
prominent
brethren
who
still
remained
in
quincy
and
desired
to
know
if
the
church
sustained
the
assertions
of
lyman
wight
elder
thompson
wrote
a
letter
to
president
joseph
smith
on
the
subject
in
which
he
protested
against
the
course
taken
by
lyman
wight
because
of
the
influence
it
was
having
on
many
of
those
who
had
so
nobly
befriended
the
saints
in
the
day
of
their
distress
besides
it
was
altogether
unjust
for
no
particular
political
party
in
missouri
was
responsible
for
the
cruelty
practiced
towards
the
saints
those
who
were
in
the
mobs
which
robbed
them
of
their
homes
burned
their
houses
ran
off
their
stock
and
who
whipped
murdered
and
finally
drove
the
people
from
the
state
of
missouri
were
made
up
of
individuals
of
every
shade
of
political
faith
and
of
every
religion
and
many
of
no
religion
whatever
it
was
unfair
then
under
these
circumstances
that
the
responsibility
should
be
laid
at
the
charge
of
any
one
party
or
sect
of
religion
so
that
wight
course
was
not
only
doing
much
mischief
but
was
also
unjust
to
counteract
the
evil
effect
of
lyman
wight
communication
to
the
joseph
smith
sidney
rigdon
and
hyrum
smith
then
the
presiding
quorum
of
the
church
published
a
letter
in
the
from
which
i
make
the
following
quotation
we
have
not
at
any
time
thought
there
was
any
political
party
as
such
chargeable
with
the
missouri
barbarities
neither
any
religious
society
as
such
they
were
committed
by
a
mob
composed
of
all
parties
regardless
of
difference
of
opinion
either
political
or
religious
the
determined
stand
in
this
state
and
by
the
people
of
quincy
in
particular
made
against
the
lawless
outrages
of
the
missouri
mobbers
by
all
parties
in
politics
and
religion
have
entitled
them
equally
to
our
thanks
and
our
profoundest
regards
and
such
gentlemen
we
hope
they
will
always
receive
from
us
we
wish
to
say
to
the
public
through
your
paper
that
we
disclaim
any
intention
of
making
a
political
question
of
our
difficulties
with
missouri
believing
that
we
are
not
justified
in
so
doing
lyman
wight
was
a
bold
man
inclined
to
be
and
refractory
no
one
could
control
him
and
even
counsel
or
advice
was
usually
disregarded
except
it
was
from
joseph
smith
a
few
years
subsequent
to
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
writing
lyman
wight
himself
said
joseph
smith
is
the
only
man
who
ever
did
control
me
he
is
the
only
man
who
ever
shall
but
to
joseph
words
lyman
wight
gave
respectful
attention
and
bent
his
own
strong
will
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
the
prophet
he
himself
was
a
master
spirit
and
could
apparently
bring
himself
to
acknowledge
but
one
to
whom
he
was
willing
to
yield
his
own
judgment
and
his
own
will
and
that
one
was
joseph
smith
it
is
said
by
those
acquainted
with
him
that
in
the
hands
his
spirit
was
as
pliable
as
that
of
a
child
it
was
one
of
joseph
peculiar
characteristics
to
be
able
to
control
men
men
too
who
were
themselves
master
spirits
who
were
themselves
naturally
leaders
and
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
such
characters
are
willing
to
take
a
second
place
but
in
the
presence
of
joseph
they
seemed
naturally
to
accord
him
the
leadership
he
was
a
leader
even
among
master
spirits
a
leader
of
leaders
and
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
briefly
inquire
into
the
apparently
mysterious
influence
which
the
prophet
exerted
over
the
minds
of
others
by
reason
of
which
he
controlled
them
since
this
particular
instance
in
which
lyman
wight
figures
illustrates
it
in
reply
to
the
letter
of
thompson
joseph
admitted
that
the
course
of
wight
was
unfair
and
said
the
church
was
not
willing
to
make
of
their
troubles
a
political
question
but
he
also
said
that
he
considered
it
to
be
the
indefeasible
right
of
every
free
man
to
hold
his
own
opinion
in
politics
and
religion
and
therefore
would
have
it
understood
that
as
an
individual
lyman
wight
had
the
right
to
entertain
and
express
whatever
opinion
he
pleased
in
regard
to
their
troubles
in
missouri
only
intimating
that
care
should
be
taken
not
to
set
forth
individual
views
as
the
views
of
the
church
in
writing
to
lyman
wight
on
the
subject
joseph
did
not
upbraid
him
nor
peremptorily
order
him
to
discontinue
the
publication
of
his
letters
or
retract
them
but
he
informed
him
that
the
matter
had
been
considered
in
a
council
of
the
church
and
that
the
result
was
that
his
course
was
disapproved
but
joseph
took
occasion
to
express
his
confidence
in
wight
good
intentions
and
said
knowing
your
integrity
of
principle
and
steadfastness
in
the
cause
of
christ
i
feel
not
to
exercise
even
the
privilege
of
counsel
on
the
subject
save
only
to
request
that
you
will
endeavor
to
bear
in
mind
the
importance
of
the
subject
and
how
easy
it
might
be
to
get
a
misunderstanding
with
the
brethren
concerning
it
and
though
last
but
not
least
that
whilst
you
continue
to
go
upon
your
own
credit
you
will
steer
clear
of
making
the
church
appear
as
either
supporting
or
opposing
you
in
your
politics
lest
such
a
course
may
have
a
tendency
to
bring
about
persecution
on
the
church
where
a
little
wisdom
and
caution
may
avoid
it
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
occasion
for
my
thus
cautioning
you
in
this
thing
but
having
done
so
i
hope
it
will
be
well
taken
and
that
all
things
shall
eventually
be
found
to
work
together
for
the
good
of
the
saints
with
every
possible
feeling
of
love
and
friendship
for
an
old
and
brother
in
the
lord
i
remain
sir
your
sincere
friend
throughout
this
whole
affair
it
will
be
observed
that
joseph
starts
out
with
the
idea
that
every
individual
is
absolutely
free
and
independent
as
to
entertaining
views
and
in
giving
expression
to
them
both
in
politics
and
religion
so
long
as
he
makes
no
one
else
responsible
for
them
that
in
correcting
lyman
wight
he
does
it
by
appealing
to
the
man
reason
and
by
pointing
out
the
possible
result
of
his
course
which
may
be
avoided
by
a
little
discretion
while
the
whole
communication
breathes
such
a
spirit
of
confidence
in
the
man
he
is
correcting
and
love
for
him
as
an
old
that
it
was
altogether
irresistible
and
this
is
the
secret
of
joseph
power
to
control
his
brethren
there
was
no
petty
tyranny
in
his
government
he
was
above
that
every
right
he
claimed
for
himself
he
accorded
to
others
while
his
mildness
in
correcting
errors
and
his
unbounded
love
for
his
brethren
knit
them
to
him
in
bands
stronger
than
steel
it
was
ever
his
method
to
teach
correct
principles
and
allow
men
to
govern
themselves
chapter
vi
a
day
of
god
power
during
the
summer
of
the
saints
who
had
been
driven
from
missouri
continued
to
gather
at
nauvoo
and
settle
on
the
lands
which
had
been
purchased
by
the
church
authorities
the
violent
persecution
they
had
passed
through
in
missouri
had
well
nigh
wrecked
the
people
they
had
been
stripped
of
their
earthly
possessions
until
they
were
reduced
to
the
most
abject
poverty
and
the
exposure
and
hardships
endured
made
them
an
easy
prey
to
the
malaria
that
infected
nauvoo
and
vicinity
another
thing
which
doubtless
contributed
to
make
them
unable
to
resist
the
ravages
of
disease
was
the
fact
that
a
period
of
relaxation
was
following
the
intense
excitement
under
which
they
had
lived
for
more
than
two
years
the
spirit
has
such
power
when
it
is
once
thoroughly
aroused
that
for
a
time
it
so
braces
up
the
body
as
to
make
it
almost
impregnable
to
disease
and
unconscious
of
fatigue
but
this
can
not
continue
long
it
wears
out
the
body
and
as
soon
as
the
excitement
is
removed
then
comes
the
period
of
relaxation
and
the
body
sinks
down
from
sheer
exhaustion
such
was
the
condition
of
the
exiled
saints
who
came
flocking
into
nauvoo
in
the
summer
of
they
had
reached
a
haven
of
rest
the
fearful
strain
on
the
nervous
system
under
which
they
had
labored
during
the
mobbings
in
missouri
and
their
flight
from
that
state
was
removed
and
they
fell
down
in
nauvoo
exhausted
to
be
a
prey
to
the
deadly
malaria
prevalent
in
that
locality
such
was
their
condition
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
joseph
house
was
crowded
with
the
sick
whom
he
was
trying
to
nurse
back
to
health
in
his
were
a
number
of
people
camped
in
tents
who
had
but
newly
arrived
but
upon
whom
the
fever
had
seized
joseph
himself
was
prostrate
with
sickness
and
the
general
distress
of
the
saints
weighed
down
his
spirit
with
sadness
while
still
thinking
of
the
trials
of
his
people
in
the
past
and
the
gloom
that
then
overshadowed
them
the
purifying
influence
of
god
spirit
rested
upon
him
and
he
was
immediately
healed
he
arose
and
began
to
administer
to
the
sick
in
his
house
all
of
whom
immediately
recovered
he
then
healed
those
encamped
in
his
and
from
thence
went
from
house
to
house
calling
on
the
sick
to
arise
from
their
beds
of
affliction
and
they
obeyed
and
were
healed
in
company
with
pratt
orson
pratt
john
taylor
heber
kimball
and
john
page
he
crossed
the
river
to
montrose
and
healed
the
sick
there
one
case
is
mentioned
by
all
who
have
written
on
the
subject
as
being
very
remarkable
this
was
the
case
of
elijah
fordham
he
was
almost
unconscious
and
nearly
dead
bending
over
him
the
prophet
asked
the
dying
man
if
he
knew
him
and
believed
him
to
be
a
servant
of
god
in
a
whisper
he
replied
that
he
did
joseph
then
took
him
by
the
hand
and
with
an
energy
that
would
have
awoke
the
dead
he
commanded
him
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
to
arise
from
his
bed
and
walk
brother
fordham
leaped
from
his
bed
removed
the
bandages
and
mustard
plasters
from
his
feet
dressed
himself
ate
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
and
accompanied
the
prophet
to
other
houses
on
his
mission
of
love
all
day
the
work
continued
and
to
the
saints
who
witnessed
the
remarkable
manifestation
of
god
power
in
behalf
of
the
sick
the
day
of
july
is
remembered
with
gratitude
to
almighty
god
who
through
the
demonstration
of
his
power
that
day
gave
an
indisputable
witness
to
the
world
that
he
was
with
joseph
smith
and
had
authorized
him
to
speak
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
to
the
saints
it
was
a
testimony
that
god
was
with
them
for
they
witnessed
a
fulfillment
of
god
ancient
promise
to
his
people
is
any
sick
among
you
let
him
call
for
the
elders
of
the
church
and
let
them
pray
over
him
anointing
him
with
oil
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
the
prayer
of
faith
shall
save
the
sick
and
the
lord
shall
raise
him
up
and
again
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
these
ancient
promises
to
god
people
had
also
been
renewed
to
the
saints
in
modern
revelations
to
the
church
through
the
prophet
joseph
himself
as
i
said
unto
mine
apostles
i
say
unto
you
again
that
every
soul
who
believeth
on
your
words
and
is
baptized
by
water
for
the
remission
of
sins
shall
receive
the
holy
ghost
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
they
shall
do
many
wonderful
works
in
my
name
they
shall
cast
out
devils
in
my
name
they
shall
heal
the
sick
in
my
name
they
shall
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind
and
unstop
the
ears
of
the
deaf
and
the
tongue
of
the
dumb
shall
speak
and
if
any
man
shall
administer
poison
unto
them
it
shall
not
hurt
them
but
a
commandment
i
give
unto
them
that
they
shall
not
boast
themselves
of
these
things
neither
speak
them
before
the
world
again
i
say
to
the
saints
who
witnessed
the
demonstration
of
power
on
the
of
july
in
the
healing
of
the
sick
in
fulfillment
of
these
promises
ancient
and

nearly
all
the
members
of
the
church
had
been
driven
from
far
west
i
have
already
related
however
in
the
missouri
persecutions
how
five
of
the
apostles
and
several
who
were
to
be
ordained
returned
by
different
routes
to

met
with
a

of

there
and
fulfilled
the
mandates
of
this
revelation
notwithstanding
the
boasts
of
the
mob
that
it
should
fail
for
some
time
the
apostles
who
started
from
the
public
square
at
far

for

were
detained
to
aid
in
settling
the
saints
at

at
this
time
was
living
at
montrose
and
was
rowed
across
the
river
in
a
canoe
by
brigham
young
on
landing
he
lay
down
to
rest
on
a
side
of
sole
leather
near
the
post
office
while
there
joseph
came
along
and
said
well
brother
woodruff
you
have
started
on
your
mission
yes
but
i
feel
and
look
more
like
a
subject
for
the
dissecting
room
than
a
missionary
was
the
reply
what
did
you
say
that
for
asked
joseph
get
up
and
go
along
all
will
be
well
with
you
shortly
afterwards
elder
woodruff
was
joined
by
elder
taylor
and
together
they
started
on
their
mission
on
their
way
they
passed
parley
pratt
stripped
bareheaded
and
barefooted
hewing
some
logs
for
a
house
he
hailed
the
brethren
as
they
passed
and
gave
them
a
purse
though
he
had
nothing
to
put
in
it
elder
heber
kimball
who
was
but
a
short
distance
away
stripped
as
elder
pratt
was
came
up
and
said
as
brother
parley
has
given
you
a
purse
i
have
a
dollar
i
will
give
you
to
put
in
it
and
mutually
blessing
each
other
they
separated
to
meet
again
in
foreign
lands
on
the
of
august
parley
pratt
and
his
brother
orson
started
for
england
leaving
nauvoo
in
their
own
carriage
on
the
fourteenth
of
the
following
month
brigham
young
left
his
home
at
montrose
and
started
for
england
he
had
been
prostrated
for
some
time
by
sickness
and
at
the
time
of
starting
on
his
mission
was
so
feeble
that
he
had
to
be
assisted
to
the
ferry
only
some
thirty
rods
from
his
house
all
his
children
were
sick
and
he
left
his
wife
with
a
babe
but
ten
days
old
and
in
the
poorest
of
circumstances
for
the
mobs
of
missouri
had
robbed
him
of
all
he
had
after
crossing
the
river
to
the
nauvoo
side
israel
barlow
took
him
on
a
horse
behind
him
and
carried
him
to
the
house
of
elder
heber
kimball
where
his
strength
altogether
failed
him
and
he
had
to
remain
there
for
several
days
nursed
by
his
wife
who
hearing
that
he
was
unable
to
get
farther
than
brother
kimball
had
crossed
the
river
from
montrose
to
care
for
him
on
the
eighteenth
of
the
month
however
brigham
in
company
with
heber
kimball
made
another
start
a
brother
by
the
name
of
charles
hubbard
sent
a
boy
with
a
team
to
take
them
a
day
journey
on
their
way
elder
kimball
left
his
wife
in
bed
shaking
with
ague
and
all
his
children
sick
it
was
only
by
the
assistance
of
some
of
the
brethren
that
heber
himself
could
climb
into
the
wagon
it
seemed
to
me
he
remarked
afterwards
in
relating
the
circumstance
as
though
my
very
inmost
parts
would
melt
within
me
at
the
thought
of
leaving
my
family
in
such
a
condition
as
it
were
almost
in
the
arms
of
death
i
felt
as
though
i
could
scarcely
endure
it
hold
up
said
he
to
the
teamster
who
had
just
started
brother
brigham
this
is
pretty
tough
but
let
us
rise
and
give
them
a
cheer
brigham
with
much
difficulty
rose
to
his
feet
and
joined
elder
kimball
in
swinging
his
hat
and
shouting
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
for
israel
the
two
sisters
hearing
the
cheer
came
to
the
door
sister
kimball
with
great
difficulty
and
waved
a
farewell
and
the
two
apostles
continued
on
their
journey
without

the
departure
of
elders
george
smith
reuben
hedlock
and
theodore
turley
was
but
little
less
remarkable
they
were
feeble
in
health
in
fact
down
with
the
ague
before
they
were
out
of
sight
of
nauvoo
their
wagon
upset
and
spilled
them
down
the
bank
of
the
river
elders
smith
and
turley
were
unable
to
get
up
not
because
of
any
injuries
they
had
received
but
because
of
their
illness
elder
hedlock
helped
them
into
their
wagon
and
they
resumed
their
journey
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
met
some
gentlemen
who
stopped
their
team
and
said
to
the
driver
what
graveyard
have
you
been
robbing
there
mark
being
elicited
by
the
ghostly
appearance
of
the
elders
for
england
thus
in
sickness
and
poverty
without
purse
and
without
scrip
leaving
their
families
destitute
of
the
comforts
of
life
with
nothing
but
the
assurances
of
the
people
who
were
as
poor
as
themselves
that
they
should
be
provided
for
the
twelve
turned
their
faces
toward
europe
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
highly
civilized
peoples
of
the
world
shaking
with
the
ague
and
then
burning
up
with
the
fever
now
in
the
homes
of
the
wealthy
then
in
the
hovels
of
the
poor
now
derided
by
the
learned
and
refined
and
now
welcomed
by
the
poor
of
this
world
who
rejoiced
in
the
message
they
bore
they
journeyed
on
never
looking
back
nor
complaining
of
the
hardships
through
which
they
were
called
to
pass
for
the
master
sake
they
had
ringing
in
their
ears
the
words
of
jesus
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
houses
or
lands
wives
or
children
more
than
he
loveth
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
again
they
had
the
promise
there
is
no
man
that
hath
left
houses
or
parents
or
brethren
or
wife
or
children
for
the
kingdom
of
god
sake
who
shall
not
receive
manifold
more
in
this
present
time
and
in
the
world
to
come
life
everlasting
with
this
warning
and
this
promise
before
them
they
made
their
way
by
different
routes
but
at
last
met
in
england
where
an
effectual
door
was
opened
for
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
and
thousands
with
joy
embraced
the
truth
these
men
went
out
weeping
bearing
precious
seed
they
returned
in
time
bringing
their
sheaves
with
them
and
had
joy
in
their
harvest
and
what
shall
separate
these
men
who
endured
so
much
for
the
sake
from
the
love
of
god
shall
tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
peril
or
sword
nay
in
all
these
things
they
shall
be
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
them

the
power
of
the
press
in
sustaining
the
work
he
had
begun
was
early
recognized
by
joseph
smith
and
his
associates
and
it
was
this
recognition
of
its
powers
which
led
him
to
establish
as
early
as
possible
a

that
would
be
under
the
control
of
the
church
voice
its

defend

the

had
been
organized
but
eighteen
months
and
its
membership
was
very
small
when
a
conference
held
in

authorized
the
purchase
of

instructed

hindered
the

taken
up
by

hyrum
clark
and
some
others
and
taken
to

where
in
the
fall
of
it
was
set
up
in

cellar
through

a
spring
of
water
was
running

on

and
this

was
issued
first
as

sixteen

afterwards
became
its

was
don

the
youngest

of

learned

then
became
the
editor
and
elder
robert
thompson
was
appointed
to
assist
him
the
manner
in
which
the
paper
was
conducted
was
very
unsatisfactory
to
the
church
authorities
and
the
twelve
apostles
took
charge
of
it
with
elders
john
taylor
and
wilford

as
its
managers
and

joseph

it
was
conducted

for
about
a
year
when
the
prophet
joseph
resigned
the
editorial
chair

john

was
assigned
to

kept
that
place
until
the
discontinuance
of
the
publication
in

of

being
driven
from
nauvoo
it
was
a
valuable
means
of
communication
for
the

authorities
as
they
were
enabled
to
reach
the

condition

pages
are

the
principal
historical

which
in
connection
with
the
principles
and
doctrine
expounded
by
its
editors
and
the
communications
from

make
it
of
inestimable
value

chapter

an
appeal
to
the
general
government
for
redress
of
grievances
it
will
be
remembered
by
those
who
have
read
the
missouri
persecutions
that
sidney
rigdon
was
released
from
prison
in
liberty
missouri
before
joseph
and
the
other
brethren
escaped
on
his
arrival
in
quincy
his
position
as
one
of
the
presidents
of
the
church
his
education
and
eloquence
gave
him
the
attention
of
the
leading
citizens
of
quincy
and
particularly
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
governor
carlin
of
illinois
by
coming
in
contact
with
him
and
relating
the
cruelties
practiced
against
the
saints
in
missouri
he
conceived
the
altogether
fanciful
and
utterly
impracticable
idea
of
impeaching
the
charter
of
missouri
on
an
item
in
the
constitution
viz
that
the
general
government
shall
give
to
each
state
a
republican
form
of
government
and
it
was
his
point
to
prove
that
such
a
government
did
not
exist
in
missouri
his
plan
was
to
present
the
story
of
the
saints
wrongs
to
the
governors
of
the
respective
states
before
the
assembly
of
the
several
legislatures
and
induce
as
many
of
them
as
possible
to
bring
the
case
before
the
legislatures
in
their
messages
another
part
of
the
plan
was
to
have
a
man
at
each
state
capital
armed
with
affidavits
that
would
give
the
necessary
information
to
the
legislatures
after
the
action
of
the
state
legislatures
the
case
was
to
be
presented
to
the
national
congress
for
its
consideration
and
action
to
carry
out
his
plans
george
robinson
was
appointed
to
take
affidavits
and
collect
general
information
bearing
on
the
subject
and
sidney
rigdon
himself
secured
letters
of
introduction
to
the
governors
of
several
states
and
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
from
governor
carlin
of
illinois
and
governor
robert
lucas
of
iowa
on
the
fifth
of
may
however
at
a
conference
of
the
church
held
near
quincy
joseph
smith
presiding
the
gigantic
and
fanciful
scheme
conceived
by
sidney
rigdon
was
considered
and
somewhat
reduced
of
its
unwieldy
proportions
by
the
conference
simply
resolving
that
this
conference
send
a
delegate
to
the
city
of
washington
to
lay
our
case
before
the
general
government
and
that
president
rigdon
be
the
delegate
and
that
colonel
lyman
wight
be
appointed
to
receive
the
affidavits
which
are
to
be
sent
to
the
city
of
washington
here
the
matter
rested
for
a
time
through
the
inactivity
of
president
rigdon
whose
ardor
in
the
work
of
god
about
this
time
began
to
wane
in
consequence
of
the
inactivity
and
lack
of
interest
manifested
by
sidney
rigdon
in
going
to
washington
to
present
the
case
of
the
saints
the
state
of
missouri
to
the
president
and
congress
of
the
united
states
at
a
high
council
meeting
held
at
commerce
on
the
twentieth
of
october
the
prophet
joseph
was
appointed
to
be
the
delegate
to
washington
and
a
few
days
later
sidney
rigdon
and
elias
higbee
were
appointed
by
the
same
council
to
assist
him
in
this
mission
as
a
contrast
between
the
two
men
sidney
rigdon
and
joseph
smith
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
after
his
appointment
to
go
to
washington
to
petition
the
general
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
in
behalf
of
the
saints
sidney
rigdon
had
allowed
nearly
six
months
to
pass
away
without
doing
anything
but
the
ninth
day
after
joseph
was
appointed
to
this
mission
he
was
found
leaving
commerce
with
a
carriage
accompanied
by
rigdon
higbee
and
orin
rockwell
for
washington
the
prophet
was
always
prompt
in
action
there
were
no
tedious
delays
in
anything
he
under
took
no
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
like
the
old
cat
the
adage
his
motto
for
the
commencement
of
his
career
had
been
when
the
lord
commands
do
it
and
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
thing
when
a
council
of
the
priesthood
or
himself
individually
had
determined
upon
any
particular
course
of
action
he
at
once
set
himself
about
performing
it
the
mission
for
the
city
of
washington
passed
through
springfield
the
capital
of
the
state
of
illinois
on
their
journey
and
here
met
with
robert
foster
who
afterwards
as
we
shall
see
became
prominently
connected
with
events
at
nauvoo
elder
rigdon
being
ill
foster
administered
medicines
to
him
journeying
with
party
for
several
days
for
that
purpose
at
last
however
elder
rigdon
became
so
weak
that
it
became
necessary
to
leave
him
near
columbus
ohio
and
orin
rockwell
and
foster
remained
with
him
while
joseph
and
judge
higbee
continued
their
journey
to
washington
it
was
during
this
journey
too
that
joseph
met
another
man
destined
to
perform
a
prominent
part
in
the
drama
enacted
at
nauvoo
this
was
william
law
whom
joseph
party
met
at
springfield
illinois
he
was
then
leading
a
small
company
of
saints
from
canada
to
nauvoo
company
remained
several
days
at
springfield
and
he
preached
there
several
times
staying
at
the
home
of
james
adams
the
probate
judge
of
that
county
judge
adams
treated
the
prophet
with
the
kindness
of
a
father
an
incident
occurred
as
the
party
approached
washington
which
borders
on
the
domain
of
the
romantic
or
perhaps
may
be
considered
to
enter
directly
into
it
the
coachman
stopped
his
horses
in
front
of
one
of
the
many
public
houses
they
passed
to
get
his
grog
when
the
horses
took
fright
and
dashed
down
the
road
at
speed
the
passengers
as
might
be
expected
became
and
one
woman
in
her
excitement
tried
to
throw
her
babe
out
of
the
window
she
was
prevented
however
by
joseph
who
calmed
her
fears
and
persuaded
the
rest
of
the
passengers
to
keep
their
seats
he
then
opened
the
door
of
the
coach
and
succeeded
in
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
vehicle
and
reaching
the
driver
seat
gathering
up
the
reins
he
stopped
the
horses
before
any
accident
occurred
either
to
coach
or
passengers
it
is
needless
to
say
that
joseph
heroism
drew
from
his
their
warmest
expressions
of
admiration
and
gratitude
no
terms
were
sufficiently
strong
to
convey
their
admiration
of
his
daring
among
the
passengers
were
several
members
of
congress
who
proposed
mentioning
the
incident
to
congress
for
they
believed
that
body
would
reward
joseph
conduct
by
some
public
act
with
this
object
in
view
they
asked
for
his
name
and
were
doubtless
dumbfounded
to
learn
that
they
had
been
saved
from
their
imminent
peril
by
the
courage
of
the
mormon
prophet
at
any
rate
the
profusion
of
thanks
and
admiration
was
stayed
and
says
joseph
i
heard
no
more
of
their
praise
gratitude
or
reward
need
one
stop
to
moralize
on
the
littleness
of
man
when
he
allows
prejudice
to
dictate
his
action
instead
of
reason
it
was
on
the
of
november
that
joseph
and
judge
elias
higbee
arrived
in
washington
and
took
up
their
abode
at
an
unpretentious
boarding
house
on
the
corner
of
missouri
and
third
streets
they
were
very
much
cramped
on
account
of
means
as
the
people
they
represented
were
poor
in
this
world
goods
and
unable
to
supply
the
means
necessary
to
enable
their
delegates
to
indulge
in
the
luxurious
style
of
living
usually
adopted
by
those
who
go
to
the
seat
of
government
on
special
missions
the
day
following
his
arrival
joseph
obtained
an
interview
with
president
martin
van
buren
who
had
been
elected
to
the
presidency
by
the
democratic
party
i
give
joseph
own
account
of
this
visit
to
president
van
buren
that
our
readers
may
judge
of
the
impression
he
made
upon
the
prophet
and
what
the
prophet
thought
of
congress
generally
on
friday
the
we
proceeded
to
the
house
of
the
president
we
found
a
very
large
and
splendid
palace
surrounded
with
a
splendid
enclosure
decorated
with
all
the
fineries
and
elegancies
of
the
world
we
went
to
the
door
and
requested
to
see
the
president
when
we
were
immediately
introduced
into
an
upper
apartment
where
we
met
the
president
and
were
introduced
into
his
parlor
where
we
presented
him
with
our
letters
of
introduction
as
soon
as
he
had
read
one
of
them
he
looked
upon
us
with
a
kind
of
half
frown
and
said
what
can
i
do
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
if
i
do
anything
i
shall
come
in
contact
with
the
whole
state
of
missouri
i
can
not
determine
whether
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
that
president
van
buren
made
use
of
the
expression
your
cause
is
just
but
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
or
whether
he
so
expressed
himself
at
some
subsequent
meeting
but
under
date
of
february
joseph
remarks
in
speaking
of
his
mission
to
washington
during
my
stay
i
had
an
interview
with
martin
van
buren
the
president
who
treated
me
very
insolently
and
it
was
with
great
reluctance
he
listened
to
our
message
which
when
he
heard
he
said
gentlemen
your
cause
is
just
but
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
if
i
take
up
for
you
i
shall
lose
the
vote
of
missouri
his
whole
course
went
to
show
that
he
was
an
that
was
his
ruling
passion
and
that
justice
and
righteousness
were
no
part
of
his
composition
as
this
language
is
somewhat
different
to
that
reported
by
joseph
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
the
president
i
am
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
the
language
attributed
to
him
in
the
latter
quotation
was
used
at
some
subsequent
meeting
to
the
first
i
again
quote
from
joseph
letter
to
hyrum
now
we
shall
endeavor
to
express
our
feelings
and
views
concerning
the
president
as
we
have
been
to
his
majesty
he
is
a
small
man
sandy
complexion
and
ordinary
features
with
frowning
brow
and
considerable
body
but
not
well
proportioned
as
to
his
arms
and
legs
and
in
fine
to
come
directly
to
the
point
he
is
so
much
of
a
fop
or
a
fool
for
he
judged
our
cause
before
he
knew
it
we
could
find
no
place
to
put
truth
into
him
we
do
not
say
the
saints
shall
not
vote
for
him
but
we
do
say
boldly
that
we
do
not
intend
he
shall
have
our
votes
joseph
speaks
very
highly
of
the
senators
and
representatives
from
illinois
who
rendered
him
some
considerable
assistance
in
getting
a
hearing
before
a
congressional
committee
but
he
was
not
favorably
impressed
with
congressmen
or
their
conduct
on
the
whole
he
says
for
a
general
thing
there
is
but
little
solidity
and
honorable
deportment
among
those
who
are
sent
here
to
represent
the
people
but
a
great
deal
of
pomposity
and
show
there
is
such
an
itching
disposition
to
display
their
oratory
on
the
most
trivial
occasions
and
so
much
etiquette
bowing
and
scraping
twisting
and
turning
to
make
a
display
of
their
witticism
that
it
seems
to
us
rather
a
display
of
folly
and
show
more
than
substance
and
gravity
such
as
becomes
a
great
nation
like
ours
however
there
are
some
exceptions
after
the
meeting
with
the
president
a
meeting
with
the
illinois
delegation
in
congress
was
arranged
to
take
into
consideration
the
best
means
of
getting
the
wrongs
of
the
saints
before
congress
this
meeting
took
place
on
the
sixth
of
december
a
robinson
of
that
delegation
whether
a
member
of
the
house
or
senate
i
do
not
know
took
a
stand
against
the
saints
presenting
any
claims
to
be
liquidated
by
the
united
states
but
joseph
contended
against
him
and
presented
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
people
and
robinson
promised
to
reconsider
the
subject
and
at
the
meeting
the
next
day
it
was
decided
that
a
memorial
and
petition
be
drawn
in
concise
form
and
presented
by
judge
young
who
had
taken
a
lively
interest
in
the
cause
of
the
saints
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
joseph
and
judge
higbee
learned
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
more
positive
testimony
on
the
subject
in
hand
so
that
they
sent
to
nauvoo
and
a
very
large
number
of
affidavits
were
taken
and
forwarded
to
washington
to
sustain
the
statements
to
be
presented
to
congress
the
petition
presented
to
congress
related
the
outrages
committed
against
the
saints
at
considerable
length
from
the
commencement
of
difficulties
in
jackson
county
in
the
autumn
of
until
their
final
expulsion
from
the
state
in
the
winter
of
and
made
emphatic
the
infamy
of
governor
boggs
exterminating
orders
which
gave
the
coloring
of
authority
for
the
action
of
the
state
they
said
in
their
statement
of
wrongs
that
if
given
an
opportunity
they
could
prove
every
allegation
they
made
against
the
state
of
missouri
and
that
neither
the
mormons
as
a
body
nor
as
individuals
of
that
body
had
been
guilty
of
any
offense
against
the
laws
of
missouri
or
of
the
united
states
but
their
only
offense
had
been
their
religious
opinions
in
conclusion
the
petition
represents
that
for
the
wrongs
endured
the
mormons
ought
to
have
some
redress
yet
how
and
where
shall
they
seek
and
obtain
it
your
constitution
guarantees
to
every
citizen
even
the
humblest
the
enjoyment
of
life
liberty
and
property
it
promises
to
all
their
religious
freedom
the
right
to
worship
god
beneath
their
own
vine
and
fig
tree
according
to
their
own
conscience
it
guarantees
to
all
the
citizens
of
the
several
states
the
right
to
become
citizens
of
any
one
of
the
states
and
to
enjoy
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
his
adoption
yet
of
all
these
rights
have
the
mormons
been
deprived
they
have
without
a
cause
without
a
trial
been
deprived
of
life
liberty
and
property
they
have
been
persecuted
for
their
religious
opinions
they
have
been
driven
from
the
state
of
missouri
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
prevented
from
enjoying
and
exercising
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
state
of
missouri
it
is
the
theory
of
our
laws
that
for
the
protection
of
every
legal
right
there
is
a
legal
remedy
what
then
we
would
ask
is
the
remedy
for
the
mormons
shall
they
appeal
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
missouri
for
redress
they
have
done
so
they
have
petitioned
and
these
petitions
have
been
treated
with
silence
and
contempt
shall
they
apply
to
the
federal
courts
they
were
at
the
time
citizens
of
the
state
of
missouri
shall
they
apply
to
the
courts
of
the
state
of
missouri
whom
shall
they
sue
the
order
for
their
destruction
their
extermination
was
granted
by
the
executive
of
the
state
of
missouri
is
not
this
a
plea
of
justification
for
the
loss
of
individuals
done
in
pursuance
of
the
order
if
not
before
whom
shall
the
mormons
institute
a
trial
shall
they
summon
a
jury
of
the
individuals
who
composed
the
mob
an
appeal
to
them
were
in
vain
they
dare
not
go
to
missouri
to
institute
a
suit
their
lives
would
be
in
danger
for
ourselves
we
see
no
redress
unless
it
be
awarded
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
we
here
make
our
appeal
as
as
and
as
believing
the
high
sense
of
justice
which
exists
in
your
honorable
bodies
will
not
allow
such
oppression
to
be
practiced
upon
any
portion
of
the
citizens
of
this
vast
republic
with
impunity
but
that
some
measure
which
your
wisdom
may
dictate
may
be
taken
so
that
the
great
body
of
people
who
have
been
thus
abused
may
have
redress
for
the
wrongs
which
they
have
suffered
the
statement
of
wrongs
and
petition
for
their
redress
was
introduced
into
the
senate
by
judge
young
and
referred
to
the
committee
on
judiciary
of
which
general
wall
was
chairman
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
joseph
left
washington
and
went
to
philadelphia
where
he
labored
in
the
ministry
among
the
saints
but
judge
elias
higbee
was
left
in
washington
to
look
after
the
interest
of
the
petitioners
before
the
senate
committee
the
subject
was
held
under
advisement
and
discussed
occasionally
until
the
fourth
of
march
when
the
committee
reported
that
report
was
of
a
character
to
crush
forever
the
hopes
of
obtaining
at
the
hands
of
the
general
government
any
redress
for
the
outrages
perpetrated
against
them
in
missouri
the
report
said
that
after
full
examination
and
consideration
the
committee
unanimously
concurred
in
the
opinion
that
the
case
presented
for
their
investigation
is
not
such
a
one
as
will
justify
or
authorize
any
interposition
of
this
government
they
stated
that
the
wrongs
complained
of
were
not
alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
officers
of
the
united
states
that
the
charges
were
all
against
the
citizens
and
authorities
of
the
state
of
missouri
that
the
petitioners
were
citizens
or
inhabitants
of
missouri
that
the
grievances
complained
of
were
committed
within
the
territory
of
missouri
and
for
these
reasons
the
senate
judiciary
committee
did
not
consider
themselves
justified
in
inquiring
into
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
facts
charged
in
the
petition
the
committee
represented
that
if
the
charges
were
true
then
the
petitioners
must
seek
redress
in
the
courts
of
judicature
either
of
missouri
or
of
the
united
states
whichever
might
have
jurisdiction
in
the
case
or
said
the
report
the
petitioners
may
if
they
see
proper
apply
to
the
justice
and
magnanimity
of
the
state
of
missouri
an
appeal
which
the
committee
feel
justified
in
believing
will
never
be
made
in
vain
by
the
injured
or
oppressed
the
report
said
that
it
could
not
be
presumed
that
a
state
wanted
either
the
power
or
lacked
the
disposition
to
redress
the
wrongs
of
its
own
citizens
committed
within
its
own
territory
whether
they
proceed
from
the
lawless
acts
of
her
officers
or
any
other
person
the
report
closed
by
asking
the
passage
of
the
following
resolution
that
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
be
discharged
from
the
further
consideration
of
the
memorial
in
this
case
and
that
the
memorialists
have
leave
to
withdraw
the
papers
which
accompany
their
memorial
the
resolution
was
passed
without
dissent
and
thus
the
appeal
to
congress
for
redress
of
the
outrages
committed
against
the
saints
by
missouri
ended
at
a
conference
of
the
church
held
in
april
following
a
number
of
resolutions
were
adopted
regretting
and
condemning
the
action
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
approving
the
course
pursued
by
their
delegation
to
congress
joseph
smith
sidney
rigdon
and
elias
higbee
and
requesting
them
to
continue
their
exertions
to
obtain
redress
for
a
suffering
people
as
opportunities
became
more
favorable
for
such
efforts
and
if
at
last
all
hopes
of
obtaining
satisfaction
for
the
injuries
done
us
be
entirely
blasted
that
they
then
appeal
our
case
to
the
court
of
heaven
believing
that
the
great
jehovah
who
rules
over
the
destiny
of
nations
and
who
notices
the
falling
sparrows
will
undoubtedly
redress
our
wrongs
and
ere
long
avenge
us
of
our
adversaries
footnotes

orson
hyde
mission
to
jerusalem
those
who
have
read
the
missouri
persecutions
will
remember
the
disaffection
of
orson
hyde
at
far
west
and
the
statements
he
made
in
connection
with
thomas
marsh
against
the
church
in
the
autumn
of
that
time
when
men
hearts
were
failing
them
for
fear
and
death
and
destruction
were
rife
when
even
strong
hearts
grew
faint
and
brave
cheeks
were
blanched
well
as
stated
in
the
account
of
his
disaffection
like
peter
of
old
this
modern
apostle
wept
bitterly
for
his
error
returned
to
the
church
was
forgiven
and
during
the
conference
held
at
commerce
in
april
he
was
called
to
go
on
a
mission
to
jerusalem
it
appears
that
elder
hyde
in
a
heavenly
vision
saw
himself
on
the
mount
of
olives
blessing
the
land
for
the
return
of
the
people
of
judah
hence
that
he
might
be
obedient
to
the
vision
he
was
appointed
to
go
to
that
land
for
the
purpose
mentioned
in
the
letter
of
appointment
which
the
prophet
gave
him
occurs
the
following
passage
the
jewish
nation
have
been
scattered
abroad
among
the
gentiles
for
a
long
period
and
in
our
estimation
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
their
return
to
the
holy
land
has
already
arrived
it
is
highly
important
in
our
opinion
that
the
present
views
and
movements
of
the
jewish
people
be
sought
after
and
laid
before
the
american
people
for
their
consideration
their
profit
and
their
learning
on
the
of
the
same
month
that
elder
hyde
was
called
he
left
his
family
at
nauvoo
and
started
for
jerusalem
without
purse
or
scrip
the
next
day
he
met
with
john
page
who
subsequently
to
the
conference
at
which
orson
hyde
had
been
called
was
appointed
to
go
with
him
to
the
holy
land
they
traveled
through
several
states
together
preaching
as
they
went
in
the
city
of
cincinnati
they
succeeded
in
raising
up
a
large
and
prosperous
branch
of
the
church
and
while
elder
page
remained
in
cincinnati
to
strengthen
the
saints
elder
hyde
made
his
way
to
new
york
these
labors
consumed
the
summer
of
and
in
january
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
the
prophet
joseph
saying
that
he
was
not
well
pleased
with
the
long
delays
of
his
servants
in
starting
on
their
mission
to
jerusalem
and
they
were
requested
to
hasten
their
departure
in
the
meantime
however
elder
page
had
lost
the
spirit
of
his
appointment
and
had
no
disposition
to
go
but
orson
hyde
on
the
receipt
of
this
reproof
set
sail
at
once
from
new
york
for
england
it
is
not
our
design
to
follow
him
through
all
his
meanderings
in
europe
or
relate
his
trials
or
his
perils
in
crossing
the
mighty
seas
and
passing
through
states
in
which
war
was
raging
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
holy
city
some
time
in
october
and
on
the
of
that
month
early
in
the
morning
was
seated
on
the
mount
of
olives
as
he
had
seen
himself
in
vision
and
wrote
the
prayer
he
had
to
offer
in
behalf
of
the
jews
and
their
city
which
had
been
for
so
long
a
time
trodden
down
of
the
gentiles
in
that
prayer
he
referred
to
the
prophecies
of
god
servants
in
relation
to
the
jews
and
jerusalem
and
asked
that
all
might
be
fulfilled
he
called
for
the
richest
blessings
of
heaven
upon
the
jews
he
blessed
by
virtue
of
his
priesthood
the
city
the
land
and
all
the
elements
to
the
end
that
judah
might
be
gathered
jerusalem
rebuilt
and
become
an
holy
city
that
the
lord
name
might
be
glorified
in
all
the
earth
at
the
conclusion
of
his
prayer
he
says
on
the
top
of
the
mount
of
olives
i
erected
a
pile
of
stones
as
a
witness
according
to
ancient
custom
on
what
was
anciently
called
mount
zion
where
the
temple
stood
i
erected
another
and
used
the
rod
according
to
the
prediction
upon
my
head
just
what
he
meant
by
saying
that
he
had
used
the
rod
according
to
prediction
on
his
head
i
have
been
unable
to
learn
except
that
it
was
a
rod
with
which
he
had
measured
the
city
i
have
called
the
attention
of
my
readers
to
this
mission
of
elder
hyde
to
jerusalem
because
it
doubtless
has
a
greater
significance
than
most
people
would
be
inclined
to
give
it
the
rebuilding
of
jerusalem
is
regarded
by
mormonism
as
of
as
much
importance
as
the
establishment
of
zion
the
gathering
of
the
dispersed
of
judah
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
great
work
as
the
reassembling
of
the
other
tribes
of
israel
and
the
commencement
of
that
work
was
made
by
elder
hyde
when
by
the
authority
of
his
apostleship
he
consecrated
that
land
to
the
return
of
the
house
of
judah
to
inhabit
it
and
rebuild
their
city
according
to
the
predictions
of
their
prophets
it
may
be
somewhat
beyond
the
scope
of
this
chapter
to
call
attention
to
it
but
surely
it
will
be
of
interest
to
the
reader
to
know
that
this
apostolic
mission
and
blessing
upon
the
holy
land
has
not
been
fruitless
but
blessings
as
a
result
are
flowing
unto
it
and
the
jews
are
beginning
to
return
to
it
at
the
time
of
apostle
hyde
visit
and
ceremonies
on
the
mount
of
olives
but
very
few
jews
were
in
the
city
or
in
judea
as
late
as
twenty
years
ago
the
consular
reports
show
that
there
were
not
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
jews
in
all
jerusalem
but
in
a
popular
magazine
for
august
under
the
editorial
caption
the
plan
for
a
hebrew
nation
the
magazine
said
a
movement
of
which
americans
hear
very
little
but
which
may
have
an
important
effect
upon
the
history
of
the
coming
century
is
going
forward
upon
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
this
is
the
return
of
the
jews
to
their
ancient
home
in
palestine
the
zionite
movement
it
is
called
for
hundreds
of
years
there
has
been
talk
of
the
jew
returning
to
jerusalem
through
all
his
years
of
oppression
and
wandering
this
vision
of
his
native
land
has
been
held
before
his
eyes
by
certain
of
his
teachers
but
it
is
only
in
the
last
twelve
years
since
the
renewal
of
persecution
in
russia
that
the
idea
has
taken
shape
there
are
now
more
than
four
thousand
colonists
in
palestine
at
jaffa
the
schools
are
hebrew
the
ancient
language
being
spoken
altogether
and
a
hebrew
literature
is
being
developed
the
works
of
the
great
english
french
and
german
authors
are
being
translated
and
writers
of
their
own
race
are
being
encouraged
the
zionite
movement
is
backed
by
the
influence
of
the
rothschilds
and
other
great
jewish
families
and
societies
and
as
we
see
its
stirring
in
every
country
we
can
believe
it
only
requires
a
great
popular
leader
to
make
it
one
of
the
important
movements
in
history
that
it
is
not
purely
religious
but
racial
is
proven
by
the
of
rabinowitz
the
christian
jew
who
became
so
well
known
here
during
the
world
fair
congress
there
is
already
one
jewish
christian
colony
in
palestine
as
a
jewish
state
palestine
might
well
become
a
country
that
would
claim
consideration
among
the
family
of
nations
if
the
zionite
continues
to
grow
such
a
result
is
almost
assured
during
the
same
month
namely
in
its
impression
of
august
the
louis
published
the
following
only
two
decades
ago
there
were
not
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
jews
in
jerusalem
at
that
time
no
houses
were
to
be
found
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
since
then
many
changes
have
taken
place
and
the
hebrew
population
mainly
on
account
of
the
increase
of
the
jewish
immigration
from
russia
now
stands
at
between
sixty
and
seventy
thousand
whole
streets
of
houses
have
been
built
outside
the
walls
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
suburban
districts
which
for
hundreds
of
years
have
remained
deserted
it
is
not
however
only
in
jerusalem
itself
that
the
jews
abound
but
throughout
palestine
they
are
buying
farms
and
establishing
themselves
in
a
surprisingly
rapid
manner
in
jerusalem
they
form
at
present
a
larger
community
than

or

return
of
prodigals
during
the
summer
of
death
reaped
a
rich
harvest
in
nauvoo
before
his
ruthless
stroke
fell
many
worthy
saints
who
had
been
connected
with
the
church
from
the
time
it
was
founded
among
the
first
to
fall
was
bishop
edward
partridge
he
died
on
the
of
may
in
the
year
of
his
age
he
was
the
first
bishop
in
the
church
and
in
that
capacity
had
presided
over
the
saints
who
gathered
to
zion
in
jackson
county
missouri
during
the
years
joseph
described
him
as
a
pattern
of
piety
and
the
lord
himself
declared
that
he
was
like
nathaniel
of
old
his
heart
was
pure
before
him
and
he
was
without
guile
his
life
was
indeed
an
eventful
one
he
was
called
from
his
merchandising
and
became
a
preacher
of
righteousness
much
in
fact
all
of
his
riches
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
mobs
of
jackson
county
in
the
autumn
of
and
upon
his
meek
and
uncovered
head
fell
a
double
portion
of
their
fury
five
years
later
he
passed
through
those
trying
times
experienced
by
the
saints
in
their
exodus
from
the
state
of
missouri
under
the
exterminating
order
of
the
infamous
governor
boggs
and
at
that
time
he
again
saw
the
fruits
of
his
industry
fall
a
prey
to
the
rapacity
of
his
relentless
enemies
stripped
of
his
earthly
possessions
and
broken
in
health
he
reached
commerce
but
the
trials
through
which
he
passed
had
proven
too
much
for
his
constitution
which
was
never
robust
and
he
passed
away
a
victim
to
the
intolerance
and
religious
bigotry
of
this
generation
in
september
of
the
same
year
father
joseph
smith
patriarch
to
the
church
and
father
of
the
prophet
joseph
was
gathered
to
his
final
home
in
the
year
of
his
age
he
was
baptized
on
the
sixth
day
of
april
and
was
one
of
the
six
who
organized
the
church
on
that
date
indeed
he
was
the
one
who
first
received
the
testimony
of
his
son
after
the
angel
moroni
visited
him
on
that
memorable
night
of
september
and
it
was
he
who
first
exhorted
his
prophet
son
to
be
faithful
and
diligent
to
the
message
he
had
received
he
endured
many
persecutions
on
account
of
the
claims
made
by
his
son
joseph
to
being
a
prophet
of
god
for
joseph
declarations
that
he
had
received
heavenly
visions
and
revelations
together
with
a
divine
commission
to
preach
the
gospel
of
christ
not
only
brought
upon
himself
the
wrath
of
the
ungodly
but
involved
his
whole
family
in
the
persecutions
which
followed
him
throughout
his
life
of
these
things
however
his
father
never
complained
but
endured
all
things
patiently
and
with
true
heroism
and
ever
supported
his
son
in
carrying
out
the
counsels
of
heaven
he
was
born
on
the
twelfth
of
july
in
topsfield
massachusetts
and
was
the
second
of
the
seven
sons
of
asahel
and
mary
smith
his
forefathers
being
among
those
who
early
came
from
england
to
massachusetts
he
was
a
large
man
ordinarily
weighing
two
hundred
pounds
was
six
feet
two
inches
tall
and
well
proportioned
strong
and
active
and
he
stood
unbowed
beneath
the
accumulated
sorrows
and
hardships
he
had
experienced
during
his
nearly
three
score
and
ten
years
of
sojourn
in
this
life
the
exposures
however
that
he
suffered
in
the
exodus
from
missouri
brought
on
him
consumption
of
which
he
died
his
was
an
unassuming
nature
noted
mostly
perhaps
for
its
sincerity
and
unwavering
integrity
he
was
a
child
of
nature
and
one
of
nature
noblest
his
life
had
been
spent
in
parts
remote
from
the
busy
marts
where
wealth
accumulates
and
men
decay
and
he
had
passed
through
his
probation
on
earth
without
being
corrupted
by
the
evil
influences
of
luxury
or
enervating
civilization
he
was
a
type
of
men
so
well
described
by
one
of
our
poets
in
the
following
lines
simple
their
lives
yet
theirs
the
race
when
liberty
sent
forth
her
cry
who
crowded
conflicts
deadliest
place
to
fight
to
bleed
to
die
who
stood
on
bunker
heights
of
red
by
hope
through
years
were
led
and
witnessed
yorktown
sun
shine
on
a
nation
banner
spread
a
nation
freedom
won
such
was
the
character
of
the
first
patriarch
of
the
church
in
this
dispensation
another
circumstance
of
interest
in
nauvoo
during
this
eventful
summer
of
was
the
return
of
a
number
of
prodigals
to
the
church
i
have
already
stated
the
case
of
orson
hyde
frederick
williams
was
dropped
from
his
position
as
counselor
to
the
prophet
in
november
and
in
march
was
excommunicated
at
a
conference
in
quincy
illinois
at
the
april
conference
in
however
he
came
before
the
assembled
church
and
humbly
asked
forgiveness
and
expressed
his
determination
to
do
the
will
of
god
for
the
future
he
was
forgiven
by
the
saints
but
was
never
restored
to
his
former
position
in
the
first
presidency
about
the
time
thomas
marsh
and
orson
hyde
fell
during
the
trying
scenes
in
missouri
phelps
and
oliver
cowdery
left
the
church
elder
phelps
was
a
man
who
had
been
of
great
service
to
the
church
and
to
the
prophet
in
a
literary
way
though
some
of
his
work
in
that
line
was
marred
by
pedantic
verbosity
and
pretension
to
a
knowledge
of
ancient
languages
which
was
not
justified
by
any
extended
acquaintance
he
had
of
them
still
he
it
was
who
in
the
early
rise
of
the
church
gave
the
cast
to
very
much
of
the
church
literature
and
as
i
remarked
he
had
been
useful
to
the
church
and
the
prophet
in
the
capacity
of
an
editor
and
writer
during
the
summer
of
he
began
to
feel
his
way
back
from
his
apostasy
into
the
church
he
had
seen
his
folly
and
began
to
tremble
at
the
gulf
which
opened
at
his
very
feet
to
devour
him
he
felt
debased
and
humbled
and
most
piteously
begged
to
be
forgiven
and
taken
back
in
the
confidence
of
his
brethren
and
the
saints
so
interesting
are
the
circumstances
connected
with
his
return
that
i
give
the
letters
which
passed
between
himself
and
the
prophet
phelps
letter
to
joseph
smith
dayton
ohio
june
brother
joseph
i
am
alive
and
with
the
help
of
god
i
mean
to
live
still
i
am
as
a
prodigal
son
though
i
never
doubt
or
disbelieve
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
i
have
been
greatly
abused
and
humbled
and
i
blessed
the
god
of
israel
when
i
lately
read
your
prophetic
blessing
on
my
head
as
follows
the
lord
will
chasten
him
because
he
taketh
honor
to
himself
and
when
his
soul
is
greatly
humbled
he
will
forsake
the
evil
then
shall
the
light
of
the
lord
break
upon
him
as
at
noonday
and
in
him
shall
be
no
darkness
etc
i
have
seen
the
folly
of
my
way
and
i
tremble
at
the
gulf
i
have
passed
so
it
is
and
why
i
know
not
i
prayed
and
god
answered
but
what
could
i
do
says
i
i
will
repent
and
live
and
ask
my
old
brethren
to
forgive
me
and
though
they
chasten
me
to
death
yet
will
with
them
for
their
god
is
my
god
the
place
with
is
enough
for
me
yea
it
is
bigger
and
better
than
all
babylon
then
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
a
large
house
with
many
mansions
with
you
and
hyrum
and
sidney
and
when
it
was
said
supper
must
be
made
ready
by
one
of
the
cooks
i
saw
no
meat
but
you
said
there
was
plenty
and
showed
me
much
and
as
good
as
i
ever
saw
and
while
cutting
to
cook
your
heart
and
mine
beat
within
us
and
we
took
each
other
hand
and
cried
for
joy
and
i
awoke
and
took
courage
i
know
my
situation
you
know
it
and
god
knows
it
and
i
want
to
be
saved
if
my
friends
will
help
me
like
the
captain
that
was
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
when
he
got
off
he
went
to
sea
again
and
made
his
fortune
the
next
time
so
let
my
lot
be
i
have
done
wrong
and
am
sorry
the
beam
is
in
my
own
eye
i
have
not
walked
with
my
friends
according
to
my
holy
anointing
i
ask
forgiveness
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
all
the
saints
for
i
will
do
right
god
helping
me
i
want
your
fellowship
if
you
can
not
grant
that
grant
me
your
peace
and
friendship
for
we
are
brethren
and
our
communion
used
to
be
sweet
and
whenever
the
lord
brings
us
together
again
will
make
all
the
satisfaction
on
every
point
that
saints
or
god
can
amen

on
their
mission
to

met
with
phelps
at
dayton
and
at
his
request
these
brethren
added
the
following
to
his
communication
brother
phelps
requests
us
to
write
a
few
lines
in
his
letter
and
we
cheerfully
embrace
the
opportunity
brother
phelps
says
he
wants
to
live
but
we
do
not
fell
ourselves
authorized
to
act
upon
his
case
but
have
recommended
him
to
you
but
he
says
his
poverty
will
not
allow
him
to
visit
you
in
person
at
this
time
and
we
think
he
tells
the
truth
we
therefore
advise
him
to
write
which
he
has
done
he
tells
us
verbally
that
he
is
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
procure
your
fellowship
life
not
excepted
yet
reposing
that
confidence
in
your
magnanimity
that
you
will
take
no
advantage
of
this
open
letter
and
frank
confession
if
he
can
obtain
your
fellowship
he
wants
to
come
to
commerce
as
soon
as
he
can
but
if
he
can
not
be
received
into
the
fellowship
of
the
church
he
must
do
the
best
he
can
in
banishment
and
exile
brethren
with
you

the
keys
of
the
kingdom
to
you
is
power
given
to
exert
your
clemency
or
display
your
vengeance
by
the
former
you
will
save
a
soul
from
death
and
hide
a
multitude
of
sins
by
the
latter
you
will
forever
discourage
a
returning
prodigal
cause
sorrow
without
benefit
pain
without
pleasure
ending
in
wretchedness
and
despair
but
former
experience
teaches
that
you
are
workmen
in
the
art
of
saving
souls
therefore
with
the

illinois
july
dear
brother
phelps
i
must
say
that
it
is
with
no
ordinary
feelings
i
endeavor
to
write
a
few
lines
to
you
in
answer
to
yours
of
the
ultimo
at
the
same
time
i
am
rejoiced
at
the
privilege
granted
me
you
may
in
some
measure
realize
what
my
feelings
as
well
as
elder
rigdon
and
brother
hyrum
were
when
we
read
your
letter
truly
our
hearts
were
melted
into
tenderness
and
compassion
when
we
ascertained
your
resolves
etc
i
can
assure
you
i
feel
a
disposition
to
act
on
your
case
in
a
manner
that
will
meet
the
approbation
of
jehovah
whose
servant
i
am
and
agreeably
to
the
principles
of
truth
and
righteousness
which
have
been
revealed
and
inasmuch
as
longsuffering
patience
and
mercy
have
ever
characterized
the
dealings
of
our
heavenly
father
towards
the
humble
and
penitent
i
feel
disposed
to
copy
the
example
cherish
the
same
principles
and
by
so
doing
be
a
savior
of
my
fellow
men
it
is
true
that
we
have
suffered
much
in
consequence
of
your
behavior
cup
of
gall
already
full
for
mortals
to
drink
was
indeed
to
when
turned
against
us
one
with
whom
we
had
oft
taken
sweet
counsel
together
and
enjoyed
many
refreshing
seasons
from
the
lord
had
it
been
an
enemy
we
could
have
borne
it
in
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
on
the
other
side
in
the
day
when
strangers
carried
away
captive
his
forces
and
foreigners
entered
into
his
gates
and
cast
lots
upon
far
west
even
thou
wast
as
one
of
them
but
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
the
day
of
thy
brother
in
the
day
that
he
became
a
stranger
neither
shouldest
thou
have
spoken
proudly
in
the
day
of
distress
however
the
cup
has
been
drunk
the
will
of
our
father
has
been
done
and
we
are
yet
alive
for
which
we
thank
the
lord
and
having
been
delivered
from
the
hands
of
wicked
men
by
the
mercy
of
our
god
we
say
it
is
your
privilege
to
be
delivered
from
the
powers
of
the
adversary
be
brought
into
the
liberty
of
god
dear
children
and
again
take
your
stand
among
the
saints
of
the
most
high
and
by
diligence
humility
and
love
unfeigned
commend
yourself
to
our
god
and
your
god
and
to
the
church
of
jesus
christ
believing
your
confession
to
be
real
and
your
repentance
genuine
i
shall
be
happy
once
again
to
give
you
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
and
rejoice
over
the
returning
prodigal
your
letter
was
read
to
the
saints
last
sunday
and
an
expression
was
taken
when
it
was
unanimously
that
phelps
should
be
received
into
fellowship
come
on
dear
brother
since
the
war
is
past
for
friends
at
first
are
friends
again
at
last
yours
as
ever
joseph
smith
jr
some
time
after
this
when
laying
out
work
for
the
brethren
to
do
in
a
sudden
burst
of
kindness
he
said
to
his
secretary
write
oliver
cowdery
and
ask
him
if
he
has
not
eaten
husks
long
enough
if
he
is
not
almost
ready
to
return
be
clothed
with
robes
of
righteousness
and
go
up
to
jerusalem
orson
hyde
hath
need
of
him
a
letter
was
written
accordingly
but
the
prophet
generous
tender
of
forgiveness
and
fellowship
called
forth
no
response
from
oliver
cowdery
once
the
second
elder
of
the
church
and
the
first
to
make
public
proclamation
of
the
gospel
to
the
world
subsequently
however
he
did
return
namely
in
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
call
the
attention
of
the
reader
to
a
peculiarity
of
mormonism
which
is
illustrated
not
only
by
this
case
of
phelps
but
by
a
multitude
of
other
cases
of
the
same
character
and
that
is
whenever
the
religion
of
the
saints
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
takes
hold
of
men
and
conviction
of
its
truth
has
struck
deep
into
the
human
soul
they
may
through
transgression
lose
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
and
of
the
church
they
may
wander
out
upon
the
hills
and
through
the
deserts
away
from
the
fold
but
they
can
never
forget
the
sweet
communion
of
the
spirit
of
god
which
they
enjoyed
before
their
fall
nor
can
they
forget
the
fact
that
they
once
knew
that
mormonism
was
true
the
recollection
of
those
things
operates
upon
the
mind
and
not
infrequently
leads
to
a
sincere
repentance
and
it
has
often
happened
in
the
experience
of
the
church
that
men
who
through
transgression
turned
away
from
the
truth
after
thorns
have
torn
their
flesh
and
the
wild
briar
stripped
them
of
their
covering
they
return
and
humbly
beg
to
be
into
their
father
house
they
can
not
forget
the
heights
from
which
they
fell
they
can
not
all
forget
the
splendor
of
that
glory
and
the
happiness
of
that
peace
they
enjoyed
in
god
kingdom
and
wicked
indeed
must
that
heart
become
that
these
recollections
will
not
lead
to
repentance
may
not
they
have
so
far
transgressed
that
they
can
not
repent
and
are
beyond
even
the
desire
for
forgiveness
are
they
not
the
sons
of
perdition
thank
god
their
numbers
are
few
again
those
who
fall
away
from
mormonism
carry
with
them
the
evidences
of
that
fall
unbelievers
say
to
mormons
come
out
of
the
darkness
of
your
superstitions
into
god
sunlight
of
freedom
but
when
one
looks
upon
the
fate
the
condition
and
experience
of
those
who
have
denied
the
faith
he
receives
small
encouragement
to
obey
the
summons
seldom
indeed
are
they
prospered
even
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
and
the
gnawing
within
writes
upon
their
faces
the
anguish
of
heart
which
their
lying
lips
deny
they
smile
but
smiling
suffer
the
heart
still
beats
but
brokenly
lives
on
and
who
so
blind
that
he
would
exchange
the
peace
the
joy
the
holy
aspirations
and
assurances
which
the
gospel
brings
for
the
unrest
the
gloom
darkness
uncertainty
and
fearfulness
which
forever
haunt
the
mind
of
the
apostate
only
those
who
would
exchange
the
glorious
light
of
heaven
for
the
murky
blackness
of
hell

john
bennett
about
this
time
there
were
other
characters
which
had
become
attracted
to
the
church
and
who
became
prominent
in
the
events
which
occurred
at
nauvoo
among
them
was
john
bennett
described
as
a
man
of
enterprise
extensive
acquirements
and
of
independent
mind
one
calculated
to
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
church
his
attention
had
been
attracted
to
the
mormon
people
during
their
persecutions
in
missouri
at
that
time
he
was
of
the
invincible
dragoons
of
illinois
and
wrote
to
the
leaders
of
the
church
in
the
hours
of
their
deepest
distress
proffering
to
go
to
their
assistance
with
all
the
forces
he
could
raise
in
illinois
as
his
bosom
swelled
with
indignation
at
the
treatment
the
saints
received
at
the
hands
of
the
cruel
but
cowardly
missourians
that
proffered
service
however
was
not
accepted
doubtless
because
the
saints
depended
for
vindication
of
their
reputation
and
redress
of
their
wrongs
upon
the
officers
of
the
state
and
nation
rather
than
upon
adventurers
who
offered
their
service
to
wage
war
upon
their
enemies
but
after
the
saints
began
gathering
at
commerce
he
again
expressed
a
desire
to
connect
his
fortunes
with
theirs
as
this
man
may
properly
be
regarded
as
the
benedict
arnold
of
the
church
at
nauvoo
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
now
noting
a
few
expressions
in
his
first
letters
to
joseph
the
prophet
which
if
they
fail
to
adorn
a
tale
they
will
at
least
point
a
moral
when
he
contemplated
joining
his
fortunes
with
the
church
at
commerce
he
held
the
position
of
in
the
militia
of
the
state
of
illinois
a
position
he
did
not
wish
to
resign
indeed
he
expressed
a
desire
to
hold
the
position
for
a
number
of
years
he
was
also
a
physician
with
an
extensive
practice
and
sent
extracts
from
the
louisville
which
gave
evidence
of
high
standing
in
his
profession
writing
of
these
things
to
joseph
he
said
i
do
not
expect
to
resign
my
office
of
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
event
of
my
removal
to
commerce
unless
you
advise
otherwise
i
shall
likewise
expect
to
practice
my
profession
but
at
the
same
time
your
people
shall
have
all
the
benefit
of
my
speaking
power
and
my
untiring
energies
in
behalf
of
the
good
and
holy
faith
in
a
communication
following
the
one
from
which
i
make
the
above
quotation
he
said
you
are
aware
that
at
the
time
of
your
most
bitter
persecution
i
was
with
you
in
feeling
and
proffered
you
my
military
knowledge
and
powers
the
egotism
of
the
man
plainly
appears
in
these
expressions
and
manifests
a
spirit
that
is
altogether
at
variance
with
the
humility
required
by
the
gospel
and
doubtless
that
laid
the
foundation
of
his
subsequent
fall
while
joseph
extended
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
doctor
to
come
to
nauvoo
he
by
no
means
held
out
very
flattering
inducements
to
him
as
may
be
seen
by
joseph
letters
to
him
in
answer
to
those
of
bennett
expressing
his
determination
to
join
the
saints
at
commerce
he
said
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
be
of
great
service
to
this
community
in
practicing
your
profession
as
well
as
those
other
abilities
of
which
you
are
in
possession
though
to
devote
your
time
and
abilities
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
a
suffering
people
may
not
be
the
means
of
exalting
you
in
the
eyes
of
this
generation
or
securing
you
the
riches
of
this
world
yet
by
so
doing
you
may
rely
on
the
approval
of
jehovah
that
blessing
which
maketh
rich
and
addeth
no
sorrow
therefore
my
general
invitation
is
let
all
who
will
come
come
and
partake
of
the
poverty
of
nauvoo
freely
i
should
be
disposed
to
give
you
a
special
invitation
to
come
as
early
as
possible
believing
you
will
be
of
great
service
to
us
however
you
must
make
your
own
arrangements
according
to
your
circumstances
were
it
possible
for
you
to
come
here
this
season
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
god
no
one
will
be
more
pleased
to
give
you
a
cordial
welcome
than
myself
surely
this
was
frank
enough
and
ought
to
have
dispelled
from
the
doctor
mind
if
at
that
time
such
ideas
lurked
there
all
thoughts
of
winning
worldly
fame
or
gratifying
vain
ambition
by
linking
his
fortunes
with
those
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ

renewal
of
hostilities
by
missouri
it
would
appear
that
hatred
hunger
is
never
fed
it
seems
to
possess
an
appetite
which
is
insatiable
and
can
never
feel
at
ease
so
long
as
the
object
of
its
detestation
remains
within
its
reach
and
even
when
that
object
is
removed
beyond
the
immediate
power
of
hatred
to
do
it
harm
as
the
dragon
of
the
apocalypse
when
he
could
not
follow
the
woman
he
had
persecuted
into
the
wilderness
cast
out
of
his
mouth
a
flood
of
water
after
her
to
destroy
her
even
so
hatred
when
baffled
in
his
efforts
to
destroy
his
victims
sends
out
floods
of
falsehood
to
overwhelm
them
by
infusing
his
own
venom
into
the
breasts
of
others
that
that
destruction
which
he
could
not
bring
to
pass
himself
might
be
brought
about
by
another
such
was
the
course
of
missouri
towards
the
saints
of
god
whom
she
had
driven
beyond
her
borders
seeing
that
she
had
not
destroyed
them
but
that
they
were
now
upon
the
eve
of
enjoying
an
era
of
prosperity
such
as
they
had
never
enjoyed
while
within
her
borders
she
employed
all
her
cunning
to
incite
the
hatred
of
the
citizens
of
illinois
against
them
but
this
was
not
easy
of
accomplishment
and
at
first
the
misrepresentations
of
a
state
that
had
been
guilty
of
such
outrages
as
those
committed
by
missouri
against
the
saints
had
but
little
weight
in
illinois
finding
that
their
accusations
against
the
people
whom
they
had
so
wronged
had
little
or
no
effect
an
effort
was
made
to
give
coloring
to
their
statements
and
stolen
goods
were
conveyed
from
missouri
to
the
vicinity
of
commerce
so
that
when
they
were
found
suspicion
might
rest
upon
the
people
in
whose
neighborhood
the
stolen
articles
were
discovered
nor
did
their
outrages
stop
at
this
but
doubtless
being
emboldened
by
reason
of
the
general
government
refusing
to
make
any
effort
to
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
saints
a
company
of
men
led
by
william
allensworth
woodyard
wm
martin
owsely
john
bain
light
lait
and
halsay
white
crossed
over
the
mississippi
to
illinois
at
a
point
a
few
miles
above
quincy
and
kidnapped
alanson
brown
james
allred
benjamin
boyce
and
noah
rogers
and
without
any
writ
or
warrant
of
any
character
whatever
they
dragged
them
over
to
missouri
to
a
neighborhood
called
tully
in
lewis
county
these
unfortunate
men
were
imprisoned
for
a
day
or
two
in
an
old
log
cabin
during
which
time
their
lives
were
repeatedly
threatened
at
one
time
brown
was
taken
out
a
rope
placed
around
his
neck
and
he
was
hung
up
to
a
tree
until
he
was
nearly
strangled
to
death
boyce
at
the
same
time
was
tied
to
a
tree
stripped
of
his
clothing
and
inhumanly
beaten
rogers
was
also
beaten
and
allred
was
stripped
of
every
particle
of
clothing
and
tied
up
to
a
tree
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
and
threatened
frequently
by
a
man
named
monday
exclaiming
g
d
d
n
you
i
cut
you
to
the
hollow
he
was
finally
however
released
without
being
whipped
after
they
had
received
this
inhuman
treatment
their
captors
performed
an
act
purely
missourian
in
its
character
that
is
they
gave
them
the
following
note
of
acquittal
tully
missouri
july
the
people
of
tully
having
taken
up
allred
with
some
others
and
having
examined
into
the
offenses
committed
find
nothing
to
justify
his
detention
any
longer
and
have
released
him
by
order
of
the
committee
woodyard
as
soon
as
the
people
of
commerce
and
vicinity
were
informed
of
this
outrage
gentiles
as
well
as
mormons
were
loud
in
their
condemnation
of
it
and
at
once
a
mass
meeting
was
called
and
resolutions
were
adopted
expressing
their
unqualified
indignation
and
calling
upon
the
governor
of
illinois
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
punish
those
who
had
committed
this
outrage
and
by
vindicating
the
law
give
the
missourians
to
understand
there
was
a
limit
beyond
which
their
deeds
of
violence
must
not
pass
wells
not
then
a
member
of
the
church
and
george
miller
were
appointed
a
committee
to
wait
upon
governor
carlin
and
lay
the
case
before
him
for
this
purpose
they
repaired
to
quincy
and
at
the
recital
of
the
cruelties
practiced
upon
the
men
who
were
the
victims
of
the
missourians
the
governor
wife
who
was
present
at
the
interview
was
moved
to
tears
and
the
governor
himself
was
greatly
agitated
he
promised
to
counsel
with
the
state
attorney
who
by
law
was
made
his
adviser
and
promised
to
take
such
steps
as
the
case
seemed
to
require
and
the
law
to
justify
just
what
was
done
by
governor
carlin
however
i
am
unable
to
learn
but
one
thing
is
certain
and
that
is
the
guilty
parties
were
never
brought
to
justice
nor
even
to
a
trial
indeed
it
may
be
that
even
then
the
love
which
governor
carlin
once
had
for
the
saints
and
which
at
last
became
dead
had
begun
to
grow
cold
scarcely
had
the
excitement
occasioned
by
the
kidnapping
of
allred
and
his
associates
subsided
when
governor
boggs
of
missouri
made
a
requisition
on
governor
carlin
of
illinois
for
the
persons
of
joseph
smith
sidney
rigdon
lyman
wight
pratt
caleb
baldwin
and
alanson
brown
as
fugitives
from
justice
governor
carlin
granted
the
requisition
was
it
another
case
of
herod
and
pilate
being
made
friends
over
the
surrender
of
god
prophet
but
fortunately
when
the
sheriff
went
to
commerce
with
his
requisition
joseph
and
his
brethren
were
not
at
home
and
could
not
be
found
so
that
the
officers
returned
without
them
these
men
were
not
fugitives
from
justice
no
process
had
ever
been
found
against
them
the
governor
himself
had
connived
at
their
escape
from
the
hands
of
the
officers
charged
with
the
duty
of
conducting
them
from
liberty
clay
county
to
boone
county
and
these
men
did
not
feel
disposed
to
try
again
the
solemn
realities
of
mob
law
in
missouri
these
circumstances
gave
the
saints
to
understand
that
their
peace
in
their
beautiful
situation
on
the
banks
of
the
placid
grand
old
mississippi
was
not
to
be
without
alloy
the
goal
of
their
final
triumph
and
rest
had
not
been
reached
these
incidents
were
a
premonition
of
danger
they
were
indeed
the
few
drops
of
rain
which
sometimes
precede
the
storm
but
a
kind
providence
shut
out
from
their
vision
how
fierce
that
storm
would
be
or
how
would
they
have
had
the
courage
to
meet

was
that

an
incident
connecting
abraham
lincoln
with
the
passage
of
this
charter
may
not
be
without
interest
the
state
of
illinois
was
at
that
time
divided
into
two
political
parties
whigs
and
democrats
both
parties
were
friendly
to
the
saints
who
considered
themselves
equally
bound
to
both
parties
for
acts
of
kindness
lincoln
was
a
whig
and
in
the
november
election
his
name
was
on
the
state
electoral
ticket
as
a
whig
candidate
for
the
state
legislature
but
many
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
wishing
to
divide
their
vote
and
to
show
a
kindness
to
the
democrats
erased
the
name
of
lincoln
and
substituted
that
of
ralston
a
democrat
it
was
with
no
ill
feeling
however
towards
lincoln
that
this
was
done
and
when
the
vote
was
called
on
the
final
passage
of
the
nauvoo
charter
he
had
the
magnanimity
to
vote
for
it
and
congratulated
john
bennett
on
his
success
in
securing
its
enactment
the
saints
rejoiced
in
the
prospects
of
liberty
secured
to
them
by
their
city
government
and
of
it
joseph
said
i
concocted
it
for
the
salvation
of
the

and
on
principles
so
broad
that
every
honest
man
might
dwell
secure
under
its
protecting
influences
without
distinction
of
sect
or
party
an
inspection
of
the
charter
will
bear
out
this
opinion
of
it
for
while
it
was
concocted
for
the
salvation
of
the
church
it
by
no
means
secured
that
salvation
by
trespassing
upon
the
rights
of
others
but
by
recognizing
the
rights
of
the
saints
to
be
equal
to
the
rights
of
other
citizens
nor
was
it
intended
that
nauvoo
should
be
an
exclusive
city
for
people
of
the
mormon
faith
on
the
contrary
all
worthy
people
were
invited
to
come
and
assist
to
build
it
up
and
partake
of
its
liberty
and
anticipated
prosperity
an
official
proclamation
issued
over
the
signatures
of
joseph
smith
sidney
rigdon
and
hyrum
smith
who
then
constituted
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
contains
the
following
passage
we
wish
it
likewise
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
claim
no
privileges
but
what
we
feel
cheerfully
disposed
to
share
with
our
of
every
denomination
and
every
sentiment
of
religion
and
therefore
say
that
so
far
from
being
restricted
to
our
own
faith
let
all
those
who
desire
to
locate
in
this
place
nauvoo
or
the
vicinity
come
and
we
will
hail
them
as
citizens
and
friends
and
shall
feel
it
not
only
a
duty
but
a
privilege
to
reciprocate
the
kindness
we
have
received
from
the
benevolent
and
citizens
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
as
an
earnest
of
the
intention
so
far
as
the
saints
were
concerned
of
carrying
out
in
practice
these
liberal
sentiments
and
extending
equal
rights
to
people
of
all
religious
persuasions
among
the
first
acts
of
the
city
council
was
the
passage
of
the
following
ordinance
introduced

that

secured

all

to

of
no

all

worship
almighty

to
the
dictates
of

they
were
restrained
from

conferred
upon

for
this
purpose
the

resolution
was
introduced
by

adopted
by
the

council
of
the
city

that
the

thanks
of
this
community
be
respectfully
tendered
to
the

of
the
state
of

as
a
feeble
testimonial
of
their
respect
and
esteem
of
noble
and
patriotic
statesmen
and
as
an
evidence
of
gratitude
for
the
signal
powers
recently
conferred
and
that
the
citizens
of
quincy
be
held
in
everlasting
remembrance
for
their
unparalleled
liberality
and
marked
kindness
to
our
people
when
in
their
greatest
state
of
suffering
and
want
the
next
move
was
to
pass
a
temperance
ordinance
which
practically
made
nauvoo
a
prohibition
city
that
is
so
far
as
prohibitory
ordinances

the
nauvoo
legion
the
nauvoo
charter
proper
really
contained
two
other
charters
viz
one
for
the
establishment
of
a
university
within
the
limits
of
the
city
for
the
teaching
of
the
arts
and
sciences
and
learned
professions
and
another
for
the
organization
of
an
independent
military
body
to
be
called
the
nauvoo
legion
an
ordinance
was
passed
on
the
third
of
february
in
relation
to
the
university
appointing
a
chancellor
and
board
of
regents
a
site
for
a
building
was
selected
and
plans
of
the
structure
were
drawn
but
that
was
as
far
as
the
matter
went
as
the
city
had
no
funds
with
which
to
proceed
with
the
work
of
construction
an
ordinance
was
also
passed
on
the
above
date
authorizing
the
organization
of
the
nauvoo
legion
the
original
provision
in
the
nauvoo
charter
establishing
this
military
body
provided
that
the
city
council
might
organize
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
subject
to
military
duty
under
the
laws
of
the
state
into
an
independent
body
of
militia
and
a
subsequent
amendment
to
the
charter
extended
the
privilege
of
joining
the
legion
to
any
citizen
of
hancock
county
who
might
by
voluntary
enrollment
desire
to
do
so
and
in
that
event
he
was
to
have
all
the
privileges
to
be
enjoyed
by
members
of
that
organization
the
charter
provided
that
the
officers
of
the
legion
should
be
commissioned
by
the
governor
and
that
the
members
thereof
be
required
to
perform
the
same
amount
of
military
duty
as
the
regular
militia
of
the
state
they
were
to
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
mayor
in
executing
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
city
and
the
laws
of
the
state

also
at
the
disposal
of
the
governor
for
the
public
defense
and
the
execution
of
the
laws
of
the
state
and
of
the
united
states
and
were
entitled
to
their
proportion
of
the
public
arms

were
exempt
from
all
military
duty
not
specified
in
these
provisions
the
commissioned
officers
of
the
legion
were
constituted
its
which
was
its
department
but
no
law
inconsistent
with
either
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
illinois
was
to
be
enacted
by
this
court
the
privilege
of
organizing
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
as
many
of
the
citizens
of
hancock
county
as
might
desire
to
unite
with
them
into
an
independent
military
body
was
highly
gratifying
to
the
people
of
nauvoo
but
more
especially
so
to
joseph
smith
who
in
speaking
of
it
in
a
proclamation
to
the
saints
scattered
abroad
said
the
nauvoo
legion
embraces
all
our
military
power
and
will
enable
us
to
perform
our
military
duty
by
ourselves
and
thus
afford
us
the
power
and
privileges
of
avoiding
one
of
the
most
fruitful
sources
of
strife
oppression
and
collision
with
the
world
it
will
enable
us
to
show
our
attachment
to
the
state
and
nation
as
a
people
whenever
the
public
service
requires
our
aid
thus
proving
ourselves
obedient
to
the
paramount
laws
of
the
land
and
ready
at
all
times
to
sustain
and
execute
them

some
of
whom
were
not
members
of
the
mormon
church
there
were
but
six
companies
at
the
time
the
legion
was
organized
in
february
but
in
september
following
the
number
of
men
had
increased
to
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
ninety
and
at
the
time
of
the
prophet
joseph
death
some
three
years
later
the
legion
numbered
about
five
thousand
with
such
strict
regulations
accompanied
by
a
natural
enthusiasm
for
military
display
and
drilled
by
competent
military
officers
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
the
legion
became
the
best
body
of
militia
in
the
state
of
illinois
it
excited
the
jealousy
and
envy
of
the
rest
of
the
militia
in
the
surrounding
counties
and
all
the
laudable
efforts
of
the
legion
to
become
an
efficient
body
of
militia
with
a
view
of
assisting
in
the
execution
of
the
state
and
national
laws
if
occasion
should
require
were
construed
by
their
enemies
to
mean
a
preparation
for
rebellion
and
the
establishment
and
spread
of
the
mormon
religion
by
conquests
of
the
sword
as
it
is
alleged
mohammed
established
his
religion
thus
the
forming
of
an
independent
body
of
militia
enabling
the
saints
to
perform
their
military
duty
by
themselves
which
the
prophet
fondly
hoped
would
remove
one
of
the
most
fruitful
sources
of
strife
oppression
and
collision
with
the
world
and
which
he
further
hoped
would
give
the
saints
as
a
people
an
opportunity
of
showing
their
attachment
to
the
state
and
nation
whenever
the
public
service
required
their
aid
by
the
misrepresentation
of
their
enemies
was
made
one
of
the
principal
rocks
of
offense
and
was
used
to
excite
the
apprehensions
and
prejudices
of
the
good
people
of
illinois
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
always
been
jealous
of
military
power
and
hence
have
been
careful
in
forming
their
political
institutions
to
subordinate
the
military
to
the
civil
authority
except
in
times
of
actual
war
and
therefore
notwithstanding
the
very
good
intentions
of
the
saints
at
nauvoo
it
was
a
very
easy
matter
for
their
enemies
to
excite
the
prejudice
and
awaken
the
fears
of
the
people
of
illinois
by
pointing
to
the
existence
of
this
elaborate
and
efficient
military
organization
with
its
frequent
musters
and
parades
and
captained
by
a
great
religious
leader
whom
notwithstanding
his
virtues
and
the
uprightness
of
his
intentions
they
had
come
to
regard
as
a
wild
religious
fanatic
prepared
to
go
to
what
lengths
they
knew
not
in
the
promulgation
of
his
religion
hence
that
which
was
to
be
a
bulwark
to
the
city
and
a
protection
to
the
saints
was
transformed
by
their
enemies
into
an
occasion
of
offense
and
an
excuse
for
assailing
them

the

on

had
stood
in

position
of
counselor
to
his
brother
joseph
since
the
apostasy
of
williams
and
his
expulsion
from
the
church
on
the
seventh
of
november
was
appointed
to
succeed
his
father
as
patriarch
to
the
church
to
hold
the
sealing
blessings
of
the
church
even
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
whereby
the
saints
are
sealed
up
unto
the
day
of
redemption
that
they
may
not
fall
notwithstanding
the
day
of
temptation
that
might
come
upon
them
he
was
also
appointed
a
prophet
seer
and
revelator
as
well
as
joseph
with
whom
he
was
to
act
in
concert
and
from
whom
he
was
to
receive
counsel
the
prophet
was
to
show
unto
him
the
keys
whereby
he
might
ask
and
receive
and
be
crowned
with
the
same
blessing
and
glory

and

of
the
priesthood
that
once
were
put

given
as
the
presiding
elder
of
the
church
to
be
a
translator
a
revelator
a
seer
and
prophet
sidney
rigdon
was
admonished
of
his
neglect
of
duty
and
of
his
lack
of
faith
he
was
told
however
if
he
would
repent
of
his
sins
and
stand
in
his
place
and
calling
he
might
continue
to
act
as
counselor
to
joseph
and
the
lord
promised
to
heal
him
and
make
him
powerful
in
testimony
the
reason
for
this
admonition
as
one
may
judge
from
the
spirit
of
it
was
that
he
to
whom
it
was
given
had
become
sour
in
his
feelings
toward
the
work
of
god
his
ardor
was
cooling
and
his
zeal
which
at
times
had
been
inordinate
seemed
now
to
be
oozing
out
of
his
disposition
william
law
whom
it
will
be
remembered
joseph
first
met
when
for
washington
law
then
leading
a
small
company
of
saints
to
nauvoo
from
canada
was
appointed
to
fill
the
vacancy
in
the
first
presidency
made
by
the
appointment
of
hyrum
smith
to
the
office
of
patriarch
and
such
blessings
and
spiritual
powers
were
pronounced
upon
him
by
the
lord
as
seldom
falls
to
the
lot
of
man
on
condition
of
his
faithfulness
he

in
the
quorum
through
the
death
of

who
was
killed
by
the

at
the
battle
of

river
in
missouri
the
high
council
for
nauvoo
was
named
and
a
presidency
given
to
the
high
priests
the
seven
presidents
of
the
seventies
were
appointed
and
all
the
quorums
of
the
priesthood
both
in
the
melchisedek
and
aaronic
divisions
were
set
in
order
so
far
as
the
appointment
of
presidents
was
concerned
besides
setting
the
priesthood
in
order
the
lord
in
this
revelation
required
that
a
house
should
be
built
to
his
name
a
house
worthy
of
all
acceptation
that
the
weary
traveler
may
find
health
and
safety
while
he
contemplates
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
prophet
joseph
and
his
family
were
to
have
a
right
of
permanent
residence
in
it
it
was
to
be
known
as
the
nauvoo
house
and
built
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
the
possession
of
individual
stock
was
to
range
from
fifty
dollars
to
fifteen
thousand
dollars
no
person
being
allowed
to
put
in
less
than
fifty
nor
more
than
fifteen
thousand
and
it
was
specially
provided
that
none
but
those
who
believed
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
the
revelations
of
god
were
to
be
permitted
to
hold
stock
in
the
house
in
addition
to
this
commandment
to
build
the
nauvoo
house
the
lord
told
the
saints
that
there
was
not
a
place
found
on
the
earth
to
which
he
might
come
and
restore
that
which
was
lost
or
which
he
had
taken
away
even
the
fullness
of
the
priesthood
nor
was
there
a
baptismal
font
upon
the
earth
where
the
saints
might
be
baptized
for
the
dead
the
doctrine
of
baptism
for
the
dead
had
been
made
known
to
the
saints
some
time
previous
to
this
and
the
ordinance
had
been
performed
in
the
mississippi
and
other
convenient
places
but
this
is
an
ordinance
of
god
house
and
can
not
be
acceptable
to
him
when
performed
elsewhere
only
in
the
days
of
the
poverty
of
his
people
and
as
more
prosperous
times
had
dawned
upon
the
church
the
saints
were
required
to
build
a
temple
to
the
name
of
the
most
high
and
they
were
further
told
that
they
were
granted
sufficient
time
to
build
a
temple
and
if
they
failed
to
build
it
at
the
expiration
of
that
appointed
time
they
should
be
rejected
as
a
church
together
with
their
dead
to
show
to
the
church
the
importance
of
erecting
this
temple
the
lord
reminded
them
how
he
had
commanded
moses
to
build
a
tabernacle
that
the
children
of
israel
could
bear
with
them
into
the
wilderness
that
those
ordinances
might
be
revealed
which
had
been
hidden
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
therefore
said
the
lord
let
this
house
be
built
unto
my
name
that
i
may
reveal
mine
ordinances
therein
unto
my
people
for
i
design
to
reveal
unto
my
church
things
which
have
been
kept
hid
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
things
that
pertain
to
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
and
i
will
show
unto
my
servant
joseph
all
things
pertaining
to
this
house
and
the
priesthood
thereof
and
ye
shall
build
it
on
the
place
where
you
have
contemplated
building
it
for
that
is
the
spot
which
i
have
chosen
for
you
to
build
it
the
location
which
the
saints
had
contemplated
as
the
site
for
the
temple
was
on
a
bold
eminence
overlooking
the
river
the
landscape
on
the
iowa
side
and
all
the
surrounding
country
for
miles
around
it
was
not
only
by
far
the
noblest
site
in
nauvoo
for
a
temple
but
ideal

the
conference
of
april
the
sixth
of
april
was
a
memorable
day
in
the
history
of
nauvoo
that
day
the
corner
stones
of
the
great
temple
which
god
by
revelation
had
commanded
his
people
to
build
were
to
be
laid
to
the
prophet
joseph
the
day
must
have
been
a
veritable
gleam
of
sunshine
amid
the
constantly
renewing
storms
of
his
eventful
career
it
was
a
beautiful
day
clear
and
balmy
propitious
for
the
exercises
to
take
place
early
in
the
morning
there
was
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
the
streets
of
militiamen
for
the
presence
of
sixteen
uniformed
companies
of
the
nauvoo
legion
was
to
add
brightness
and
interest
to
the
imposing
ceremonies
a
great
procession
was
formed
and
marched
to
the
temple
site
here
the
legion
was
formed
in
a
hollow
square
surrounding
the
excavations
made
for
the
foundation
of
the
temple
and
enclosing
the
officers
of
the
legion
choir
citizens
and
prominent
elders
of
the
church
who
were
to
lay
the
corner
stones
of
that
structure
sidney
rigdon
was
the
orator
of
the
occasion
and
doubtless
owing
to
the
recent
admonition
he
had
received
in
the
revelation
from
the
lord
to
which
reference
has
been
made
he
was
aroused
from
his
lethargy
for
the
time
at
any
rate
on
this
occasion
he
spoke
with
his
old
fervor
and
eloquence
he
reviewed
the
trials
of
the
past
the
blessings
they
then
enjoyed
the
brightening
prospects
of
the
future
and
dwelt
at
some
length
upon
the
importance
of
building
temples
and
the
labor
to
be
performed
in
them
at
the
conclusion
of
the
oration
at
the
direction
of
the
first
presidency
the
architects
lowered
the
southeast
cornerstone
to
its
place
and
joseph
smith
said
this
principal
in
representation
of
the
first
presidency
is
now
duly
laid
in
honor
of
the
great
god
and
may
it
there
remain
until
the
whole
fabric
is
completed
and
may
the
same
be
accomplished
speedily
that
the
saints
may
have
a
place
in
which
to
worship
god
and
the
son
of
man
have
where
to
lay
his
head
to
which
sidney
rigdon
added
may
the
persons
employed
in
the
erection
of
this
house
be
preserved
from
all
harm
while
engaged
in
its
construction
till
the
whole
is
completed
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
even
so
amen
thus
were
laid
the
of
the
nauvoo
temple
amid
the
rejoicing
of
the
saints
and
even
strangers
forgot
their
prejudices
and
joined
with
hearty
good
will
as
interested
spectators
of
the
proceedings
such
an
almost
countless
multitude
of
people
says
one
enthusiastic
account
of
the
scenes
of
the
day
written
at
the
time
moving
in
harmony
in
friendship
in
dignity
told
with
a
voice
not
easily
misunderstood
that
they
were
a
people
of
intelligence
and
virtue
and
order
in
short
that
they
were
saints
and
that
the
god
of
love
purity
and
light
was
their
god
their
exemplar
and
director
and
that
they
were
blessed
and
happy
while
on
this
subject
i
quote
the
instructions
on
temple
building
from
the
history
of
the
prophet
if
the
strict
order
of
the
priesthood
were
carried
out
in
the
building
of
temples
the
first
stone
will
be
laid
at
the
southeast
corner
by
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
the
southwest
corner
should
be
laid
next
the
third
or
northwest
corner
next
and
the
fourth
or
northeast
corner
the
last
the
first
presidency
should
lay
the
southeast
and
dictate
who
are
the
proper
persons
to
lay
the
other
if
a
temple
is
built
at
a
distance
and
the
first
presidency
are
not
present
then
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
apostles
are
the
proper
persons
to
dictate
the
order
for
that
temple
and
in
the
absence
of
the
twelve
apostles
then
the
presidency
of
the
stake
will
lay
the
southeast
the
melchisedek
priesthood
laying
the
on
the
east
side
of
the
temple
and
the
lesser
priesthood
those
on
the
west
side
during
the
remaining
days
of
the
conference
opened
with
such
splendid
ceremonies
the
saints
were
instructed
in
principle
and
doctrine
the
quorums
of
the
priesthood
were
arranged
in
their
proper
order
and
the
important
questions
of
business
put
to
each
quorum
separately
and
voted
upon
especially
the
names
of
those
whom
god
had
appointed
and
reappointed
to
fill
the
respective
positions
alluded
to
in
the
revelation
above
quoted
besides
this
the
several
charters
of
nauvoo
the
legion

agricultural
and
manufacturing

were
read
and
accepted
by

john
bennett
was
presented
in
connection
with
the
first
presidency
as
assistant
president
until
sidney
rigdon
health
should
be
restored
everything
necessary
for
the
welfare
happiness
and
prosperity
of
the
saints
was
considered
and
preparations
made
to
push
the
work
of
god
forward
in
all
its
departments
the
conference
lasted
from
wednesday
morning
until
sunday
night
and
is
one
of
the
most
important
ever
held
by
the
church
indeed
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
saints
at
the
time
were
of
a
character
to
bid
them
hope
that
nauvoo
would
be
to
them
a
safe
retreat
the
friendship
of
nearly
all
of
the
leading
men
of
the
state
the
universal
sympathy
felt
by
the
people
of
illinois
for
the
victims
of
missouri
fury
the
action
of
the
state
legislature
in
granting
the
several
charters
noted
in
chapter
fifteen
all
supported
the
hopes
entertained
chapter
xviii
prophet
trial
at
monmouth
early
in
the
summer
of
an
event
happened
which
threatened
the
peace
of
the
inhabitants
of
nauvoo
when
busily
intent
in
the
performance
of
some
labor
or
duty
or
even
when
in
pursuit
of
pleasure
how
often
it
happens
that
we
work
on
or
enjoy
our
pleasure
in
the
bright
sunshine
without
ever
thinking
of
storms
until
a
sudden
clap
of
thunder
startles
us
and
looking
up
we
see
that
dark
clouds
have
arisen
above
the
horizon
the
bright
skies
are
rapidly
becoming
overcast
a
storm
is
impending
so
it
was
with
the
saints
at
nauvoo
concerning
the
matter
of
which
we
speak
it
fell
upon
them
as
unexpectedly
as
falls
a
thunderbolt
from
a
cloudless
sky
it
occurred
in
this
manner
when
hyrum
smith
and
william
law
started
on
the
mission
to
the
eastern
states
to
which
they
were
appointed
by
the
revelation
of
january
joseph
accompanied
them
as
far
as
quincy
and
when
returning
to
nauvoo
he
stopped
at
heberlin
hotel
on
bear
creek
some
miles
south
of
that
city
while
here
a
sheriff
posse
under
the
direction
of
thomas
king
sheriff
of
adams
county
accompanied
by
an
officer
from
missouri
arrested
him
on
a
requisition
from
the
governor
of
the
state
of
missouri
the
warrant
upon
which
the
arrest
was
made
was
the
one
issued
by
the
authorities
of
missouri
early
in
september
an
effort
to
serve
which
was
made
on
the
fifteenth
of
that
month
but
the
officers
failed
in
their
errand
as
the
brethren
wanted
viz
joseph
smith
sidney
rigdon
lyman
wight
pratt
caleb
baldwin
and
a
brown
were
not
in
nauvoo
that
is
they
evaded
arrest
as
already
related
in
a
former
chapter
the
complaint
on
which
the
requisition
of
the
governor
of
illinois
was
based
charged
that
these
men
were
fugitives
from
justice
and
they
were
wanted
in
missouri
to
answer
to
the
old
charges
of
theft
arson
and
murder
supposed
to
have
been
committed
in
caldwell
and
daviess
counties
in
the
summer
and
fall
of
what
made
joseph
arrest
more
a
matter
of
surprise
to
him
was
that
only
a
few
hours
previous
to
its
being
made
he
had
been
in
company
with
governor
carlin
at
the
latter
residence
and
was
treated
with
the
greatest
respect
and
kindness
yet
not
one
word
was
said
by
the
governor
about
the
requisition
made
by
missouri
for
his
arrest
joseph
returned
to
quincy
in
company
with
the
sheriff
posse
and
secured
a
writ
of
from
charles
warren
master
in
chancery
the
same
evening
saturday
june
judge
stephen
douglass
arrived
in
quincy
and
appointed
the
hearing
on
the
writ
to
take
place
the
following
tuesday
at
monmouth
warren
county
in
the
meantime
the
news
of
joseph
arrest
reached
nauvoo
and
created
no
little
excitement
a
party
of
seven
men
under
the
leadership
of
hosea
stout
left
nauvoo
for
quincy
sunday
morning
in
a
skiff
to
render
the
prophet
any
assistance
in
their
power
and
prevent
if
possible
his
enemies
taking
him
to
missouri
they
struggled
against
a
all
day
but
reached
quincy
at
dusk
only
to
learn
that
joseph
had
gone
to
nauvoo
in
charge
of
sheriff
king
and
another
officer
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
return
sheriff
king
was
taken
sick
at
nauvoo
but
joseph
nursed
him
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
brother
and
the
day
following
monday
started
for
monmouth
accompanied
by
a
large
number
of
the
leading
men
of
nauvoo
and
the
sheriff
whom
joseph
cared
for
personally
during
the
journey
of
miles
the
party
arrived
at
monmouth
on
tuesday
but
at
the
request
of
the
state
attorney
who
claimed
he
was
not
prepared
on
the
case
the
hearing
was
postponed
until
the
next
day
the
appearance
of
joseph
in
monmouth
caused
considerable
excitement
he
was
invited
to
preach
but
thought
it
best
as
he
was
a
prisoner
not
to
do
so
but
he
appointed
amasa
lyman
to
preach
in
the
court
room
on
wednesday
evening
the
prejudice
of
the
people
of
monmouth
was
as
excessive
as
it
was
blind
they
employed
at
their
own
expense
several
attorneys
to
assist
the
prosecution
and
declared
that
if
there
were
any
lawyers
in
the
district
who
would
even
undertake
the
defense
of
the
prophet
they
never
need
look
to
the
people
of
that
county
again
for
political
favors
but
there
were
strong
men
in
attendance
at
the
court
men
not
to
be
frightened
by
such
threats
and
whose
souls
despised
the
petty
minds
that
could
frame
them
joseph
therefore
was
ably
defended
by
charles
warren
sidney
little
browning
james
ralston
cyrus
walker
and
archibald
williams
the
pleadings
of
the
lawyers
for
the
defense
were
peculiarly
affecting
since
all
of
them
were
more
or
less
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
the
saints
when
they
fled
from
the
violence
of
missourians
to
illinois
browning
had
seen
several
of
these
companies
of
saints
in
their
flight
and
could
trace
them
by
the
blood
left
in
their
footprints
on
the
snow
his
recital
of
their
sufferings
moved
judge
douglass
most
of
the
officers
of
the
court
and
the
spectators
to
tears
one
of
the
brethren
present
who
wrote
an
account
of
the
trial
for
the
nauvoo
papers
says
he
browning
concluded
his
remarks
by
saying
to
tell
the
prisoner
to
go
to
missouri
for
a
trial
was
adding
insult
to
injury
and
then
said
great
god
have
i
not
seen
it
yes
my
eyes
have
beheld
the
traces
of
innocent
women
and
children
in
the
dreary
winter
who
had
traveled
hundreds
of
miles
barefoot
through
frost
and
snow
to
seek
a
refuge
from
their
savage
pursuers
was
a
scene
of
horror
sufficient
to
have
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
an
adamantine
heart
and
shall
this
unfortunate
man
whom
their
fury
has
seen
proper
to
select
for
sacrifice
be
driven
into
such
a
savage
land
where
none
dare
to
enlist
in
the
cause
of
justice
if
there
was
no
other
voice
under
heaven
ever
to
be
heard
in
this
cause
gladly
would
i
stand
alone
and
proudly
spend
my
latest
breath
in
defense
of
an
american
citizen
the
lawyers
for
the
prosecution
according
to
joseph
own
account
acted
honorably
and
confined
themselves
to
the
merits
of
the
case
excepting
two
knowlton
and
jennings
they
made
an
appeal
both
to
the
passions
and
prejudices
of
the
people
and
sought
to
create
an
excitement
over
the
matter
judge
douglass
however
was
impartial
in
his
rulings
and
doubtless
one
officer
of
the
court
the
sheriff
of
warren
county
thought
him
severe
in
his
efforts
to
protect
the
prisoner
the
court
room
was
densely
packed
and
the
judge
ordered
the
sheriff
to
keep
the
spectators
back
but
this
he
neglected
and
the
judge
fined
him
ten
dollars
in
a
few
minutes
the
order
to
keep
the
spectators
from
crowding
the
prisoner
and
witnesses
was
repeated
and
the
sheriff
told
the
court
that
he
had
ordered
a
constable
to
do
it
clerk
said
judge
douglass
add
ten
dollars
more
to
that
fine
this
was
effectual
the
sheriff
after
that
did
his
duty
joseph
claimed
in
this
case
that
he
was
unlawfully
held
a
prisoner
and
he
could
prove
that
the
indictment
upon
which
he
was
arrested
had
been
obtained
by
fraud
bribery
and
duress
this
line
of
defense
however
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
the
court
had
the
right
to
inquire
into
the
merits
of
the
case
a
long
debate
between
opposing
counsel
followed
but
it
will
be
remembered
that
an
attempt
to
arrest
joseph
on
the
requisition
from
the
governor
of
missouri
had
been
made
in
september
previous
and
it
appears
that
after
the
fruitless
effort
to
make
the
arrest
the
sheriff
of
hancock
county
returned
the
writ
and
the
defense
claimed
that
after
the
return
of
the
writ
to
the
executive
the
defendant
could
not
be
again
legally
arrested
upon
it
it
was
upon
this
point
that
the
court
set
joseph
at
liberty
following
is
judge
douglass
decision
on
this
point
the
writ
being
once
returned
to
the
executive
by
the
sheriff
of
hancock
county
was
dead
and
stood
in
the
same
relationship
as
any
other
writ
which
might
issue
from
the
circuit
court
and
consequently
the
defendant
can
not
be
held
in
custody
on
that
writ
on
the
other
point
in
the
case
as
to
whether
evidence
in
the
case
was
admissible
the
judge
withheld
his
opinion
for
further
consideration
as
the
question
was
a
grave
one
involving
the
future
conduct
of
the
states
in
their
relationship
with
each
other
but
on
the
ground
that
the
writ
was
void
dead
by
reason
of
a
former
return
being
made
on
it
by
the
sheriff
of
hancock
county
he
ordered
the
discharge
of
the
prisoner
and
missouri
was
again
foiled
in
her
designs
upon
the
life
of
the
prophet
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
joseph
ordered
dinner
for
his
company
which
numbered
by
that
time
some
sixty
men
and
when
i
called
for
the
tavern
bill
says
joseph
the
unconscientious
fellow
replied
one
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
some
time
after
this
in
september
following
joseph
sent
the
costs
of
this
trial
to
the
sheriff
of

of

many
occasions

chapter
xix
events
of
the
summer
of
nauvoo
was
the
most
promising
and
thrifty
city
in
illinois
and
the
fame
thereof
extended
throughout
the
nation
due
in
part
of
course
to
the
peculiar
religion
of
its
inhabitants
strangers
from
far
and
near
made
it
a
point
to
visit
nauvoo
and
the
peace
sobriety
industry
and
public
spirit
of
the
citizens
challenged
their
admiration
whatever
views
they
might
entertain
respecting
their
religion
a
large
bowery
was
constructed
just
west
of
the
temple
site
where
the
people
assembled
for
worship
here
the
prophet
joseph
preached
some
of
his
most
powerful
discourses
and
taught
his
people
in
the
doctrine
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
and
not
infrequently
it
happened
that
fools
who
came
to
mock
remained
to
pray
the
saints
never
intended
to
make
either
their
city
or
the
nauvoo
legion
exclusively
mormon
on
the
contrary
the
people
at
nauvoo
expressed
a
willingness
to
unite
with
their
in
every
good
work
and
enterprise
and
tolerate
religious
differences
indeed
repeated
invitations
were
sent
out
to
the
honorable
men
not
only
of
the
state
of
illinois
but
of
the
united
states
to
men
of
capital
and
of
influence
and
of
integrity
asking
them
to
come
to
nauvoo
and
assist
in
building
up
a
glorious
city
in
july
sidney
little
of
the
state
senate
was
killed
by
leaping
from
his
carriage
while
his
horse
was
unmanageable
and
that
the
saints
might
mourn
with
those
who
are
called
to
mourn
the
eighteenth
day
of
july
was
set
apart
as
a
day
of
fasting
among
the
people
of
nauvoo
by
thus
manifesting
a
feeling
of
sympathy
and
interest
they
sought
to
cultivate
peace
and
among
their
and
a
number
of
honorable
and
some
of
them
influential
men
while
not
accepting
the
faith
of
the
saints
became
friendly
disposed
towards
them
and
associated
with
them
in
various
business
transactions
but
the
of
the
saints
was
not
very
generally
reciprocated
by
the
people
of
illinois
and
there
were
even
at
that
early
date
envyings
and
bitterness
manifested
by
those
who
were
jealous
of
the
prosperity
and
increasing
power
of
the
mormons
in
nauvoo
and
vicinity
the
same
spirit
existed
to
some
extent
in
iowa
as
will
be
seen
by
the
following
occurrence
general
swazey
in
command
of
the
militia
of
iowa
territory
invited
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
and
general
bennett
to
attend
the
parade
of
the
militia
of
that
territory
at
montrose
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
general
swazey
received
his
visitors
courteously
and
so
did
the
militia
but
during
a
recess
in
the
exercises
taken
at
noon
a
kilburn
tried
to
create
a
disturbance
by
circulating
the
following
note
among
the
troops
citizens
of
iowa
the
laws
of
iowa
do
not
require
you
to
muster
or
be
reviewed
by
joe
smith
or
general
bennett
and
should
they
have
the
impudence
to
attempt
it
it
is
hoped
that
every
person
having
a
proper
respect
for
himself
will
at
once
leave
the
ranks
the
facts
are
that
these
militia
companies
were
not
mustered
by
joseph
order
nor
did
he
expect
to
review
them
he
had
simply
accepted
general
swazey
invitation
to
witness
the
movements
of
the
troops
as
other
spectators
were
doing
and
neither
joseph
nor
hyrum
was
in
uniform
general
swazey
had
been
several
times
invited
to
attend
the
drills
and
reviews
of
the
legion
at
nauvoo
and
he
had
simply
returned
the
courtesy
to
the
officers
of
the
legion
kilburn
effort
however
to
create
a
disturbance
was
not
successful
though
the
papers
of
the
state
commented
upon
it
and
some
of
them
began
to
whisper
that
it
was
joseph
ambition
to
build
up
a
military
church
and
extend
his
faith
by
the
sword
early
in
the
summer
of
in
fact
in
the
month
of
may
joseph
called
upon
the
saints
everywhere
to
come
into
hancock
county
that
there
might
be
a
concentration
of
effort
to
build
up
nauvoo
the
proclamation
closed
with
these
words
let
it
therefore
be
understood
that
all
the
stakes
excepting
those
in
this
county
hancock
and
in
lee
county
iowa
are
discontinued
and
the
saints
instructed
to
settle
in
this
county
as
soon
as
circumstances
will
permit
the
twelve
apostles
whose
departure
from
nauvoo
on
their
missions
to
england
under
very
trying
circumstances
was
related
in
a
former
chapter
returned
during
the
summer
after
accomplishing
one
of
the
most
successful
and
remarkable
missions
in
modern
times
they
were
a
tower
of
strength
to
joseph
and
he
was
not
long
in
availing
himself
of
their
valuable
support
at
a
special
conference
convened
in
nauvoo
on
the
sixteenth
of
august
joseph
said
the
time
had
come
when
the
twelve
should
be
called
upon
to
stand
in
their
place
next
to
the
first
presidency
and
attend
to
the
settling
of
emigrants
and
the
business
of
the
church
at
the
stakes
and
assist
to
bear
off
the
kingdom
victoriously
to
the
nations
and
he
at
once
turned
over
to
their
management
many
of
the
temporal
affairs
with
which
he
had
been
perplexed
and
devoted
himself
more
exclusively
to
spiritual
labors
one
of
the
most
pleasing
events
that
happened
during
the
summer
of
which
i
write
was
the
visit
of
the
indian
chief
keokuk
to
nauvoo
he
was
accompanied
by
kiskukosh
appenoose
and
about
one
hundred
chiefs
and
braves
of
the
sac
and
fox
tribes
together
with
their
families
they
were
brought
over
from
the
iowa
side
on
the
ferry
and
two
large
flat
boats
the
band
and
a
detachment
of
the
legion
met
them
at
the
landing
but
as
soon
as
keokuk
failed
to
recognize
joseph
among
those
who
had
come
to
bid
him
welcome
he
refused
to
land
or
allow
any
of
his
party
to
go
ashore
until
joseph
made
his
appearance
the
arrangement
had
been
made
for
the
band
and
the
detachment
of
the
legion
to
lead
the
dusky
visitors
to
the
grove
where
the
saints
held
their
meetings
and
there
joseph
would
have
joined
them
but
keokuk
seemed
to
have
his
own
ideas
in
relation
to
the
etiquette
to
be
observed
at
his
reception
and
waited
until
the
prophet
met
him
at
the
landing
and
bade
him
welcome
to
nauvoo
at
the
grove
joseph
addressed
the
indians
at
some
length
upon
what
the
lord
had
revealed
to
him
concerning
their
and
recited
to
them
the
glorious
promises
contained
in
the
book
of
mormon
respecting
themselves
the
despised
remnants
of
a
once
splendid
race
how
their
hearts
must
have
glowed
and
their
eyes
brightened
as
they
listened
to
the
young
prophet
relate
the
story
of
their
forefathers
rise
and
fall
and
the
bright
promises
held
out
to
them
of
redemption
from
their
fallen
state
in
conclusion
joseph
counseled
them
to
cease
killing
each
other
and
warring
with
other
tribes
or
with
the
whites
to
speech
keokuk
replied
i
have
a
book
of
mormon
at
my
wigwam
that
you
gave
me
a
number
of
moons
ago
i
believe
you
are
a
great
and
good
man
keokuk
looks
rough
but
i
am
a
son
of
the
great
spirit
i
have
heard
your
advice
we
intend
to
quit
fighting
and
follow
the
good
talk
you
have
given
us
after
the
talk
they
were
feasted
by
the
saints
with
good
food
and
dainties
and
melons
at
the
conclusion
of
the
feast
they
gave
a
specimen
of
their
war
dance
to
entertain
the
spectators
and
then
returned
to
the
iowa
side
of
the
river
to
their
encampment
thus
passed
away
the
summer
of
and
by
the
first
of
october
the
date
fixed
for
the
conference
the
early
autumn
frosts
had
tinged
the
forest
leaves
with
purple
and
gold
giving
to
the
splendid
scenery
about
nauvoo
an
additional
charm
president
joseph
smith
was
not
present
at
the
opening
of
the
conference
he
had
that
morning
gone
to
assist
in
laying
the
of
the
nauvoo
house
which
the
saints
by
revelation
had
been
commanded
to
build
and
the
conference
was
opened
by
president
brigham
young
the
principal
subject
brought
before
the
people
at
this
conference
was
the
redemption
of
the
dead
and
building
the
temple
this
matter
appeared
to
impress
itself
upon
the
mind
of
joseph
with
great
force
and
nothing
apparently
gave
him
more
delight
than
to
explain
its
importance
to
his
people
up
to
this
time
many
baptisms
for
the
dead
had
been
performed
in
the
river
but
it
was
now
announced
that
no
more
baptisms
for
the
dead
should
be
attended
to
until
it
could
be
done
in
the
font
of
the
lord
house
for
thus
had
the
lord
commanded
the
saints
however
were
not
long
denied
the
privilege
of
performing
this
work
of
baptism
for
their
dead
as
on
the
eighth
of
november
following
the
conference
a
temporary
baptismal
font
had
been
completed
and
dedicated
in
the
basement
of
the
temple
on
the
occasion
of
the
angel
moroni
first
appearance
to
joseph
smith
in
he
repeated
to
the
young
prophet
the
words
of
malachi
recorded
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
the
book
of
malachi
the
fifth
and
sixth
verses
though
quoting
somewhat
differently
from
the
language
of
king
james
translation
as
follows
behold
i
will
reveal
unto
you
the
priesthood
by
the
hand
of
elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
and
he
will
plant
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
the
promises
made
to
the
fathers
and
the
hearts
of
the
children
shall
turn
to
their
fathers
if
it
were
not
so
the
whole
earth
would
be
utterly
wasted
at
his
coming
in
fulfillment
of
this
promised
visitation
in
april
elijah
the
prophet
appeared
to
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
and
said
behold
the
time
has
fully
come
which
was
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
malachi
testifying
that
he
elijah
should
be
sent
before
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
come
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
the
children
to
the
fathers
lest
the
whole
earth
be
smitten
with
a
curse
therefore
the
keys
of
this
dispensation
are
committed
into
your
hands
and
by
this
ye
may
know
that
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
is
near
even
at
the
doors
and
now
when
something
like
peace
had
come
to
the
church
and
settled
conditions
obtained
the
prophet
of
god
began
to
unfold
the
doctrine
of
salvation
for
the
dead
the
application
of
those
principles
of
salvation
to
past
generations
who
had
lived
upon
the
earth
when
neither
the
gospel
nor
divine
authority
to
administer
its
ordinances
were
among
men
in
addition
to
the
main
idea
of
this
doctrine
which
he
taught
with
such
great
power
the
following
gems
are
gathered
from
his
teachings
at
this
conference
chiefly
relating
to
the
same
subject
the
proclamation
of
the
first
principles
of
the
gospel
was
a
means
of
salvation
to
men
individually
and
it
was
the
truth
and
not
men
that
saved
them
but
men
by
actively
engaging
in
rites
of
salvation
substantially
became
instruments
in
bringing
multitudes
of
their
kindred
into
the
kingdom
of
god
and
hence
he
presented
baptism
for
the
dead
as
the
only
way
by
which
men
can
appear
as
saviors
on
mount
zion
the
difference
between
an
angel
and
a
ministering
spirit
the
one
the
first
is
a
resurrected
or
translated
body
with
its
spirit
ministering
to
embodied
spirits
the
other
a
disembodied
spirit
visiting
and
ministering
to
disembodied
spirits
jesus
christ
became
a
ministering
spirit
while
his
body
was
laying
in
the
sepulchre
to
the
spirits
in
prison
to
fulfill
an
important
part
of
his
mission
without
which
he
could
not
have
perfected
his
work
or
entered
into
his
rest
after
his
resurrection
he
appeared
as
an
angel
to
his
disciples
translated
bodies
can
not
enter
into
rest
until
they
have
undergone
a
change
equivalent
to
death
translated
bodies
are
designed
for
future
missions
the
angel
which
appeared
to
john
on
the
isle
of
patmos
was
a
translated
or
resurrected
body
jesus
christ
went
in
body
after
his
resurrection
to
minister
to
translated
and
resurrected
bodies
it
is
no
more
incredible
that
god
should
the
dead
than
that
he
should
raise
the
dead
there
is
never
a
time
when
the
spirit
is
too
old
to
approach
god
all
are
within
the
reach
of
pardoning
mercy
who
have
not
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
which
hath
no
forgiveness
neither
in
this
world
nor
in
the
world
to
come
there
is
a
way
to
release
the
spirit
of
the
dead
that
is
by
the
power
and
authority
of
the
priesthood
by
binding
and
loosing
on
earth
this
doctrine
appears
glorious
inasmuch
as
it
exhibits
the
greatness
of
divine
compassion
and
benevolence
in
the
extent
of
the
plan
of
human
salvation
this
glorious
truth
is
well
calculated
to
enlarge
the
understanding
and
to
sustain
the
soul
under
troubles
difficulties
and
distresses
for
illustration
suppose
the
case
of
two
men
brothers
equally
intelligent
learned
virtuous
and
lovely
walking
in
uprightness
and
in
all
good
conscience
so
far
as
they
had
been
able
to
discern
duty
from
the
muddy
stream
of
tradition
or
from
the
blotted
page
of
the
book
of
nature
one
dies
and
is
buried
having
never
heard
the
gospel
of
reconciliation
to
the
other
the
message
of
salvation
is
sent
he
hears
and
embraces
it
and
is
made
the
heir
of
eternal
life
shall
the
one
become
a
partaker
of
glory
and
the
other
consigned
to
hopeless
perdition
is
there
no
chance
for
his
escape
sectarianism
answers
none
none
none
such
an
idea
is
worse
than
atheism
the
truth
shall
break
down
and
dash
in
pieces
all
such
bigoted
pharisaism
the
sects
shall
be
sifted
the
honest
in
heart
brought
out
and
their
priests
left
in
the
midst
of
their
corruption
this
doctrine
presents
in
a
clear
light
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
god
in
preparing
an
ordinance
for
the
salvation
of
the
dead
being
baptized
by
proxy
their
names
recorded
in
heaven
and
they
judged
according
to
the
deeds
done
in
the
body
this
doctrine
was
the
burden
of
the
scriptures
those
saints
who
neglect
it
in
behalf
of
their
deceased
relatives
do
it
at
the
peril
of
their
own
salvation
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
will
bring
to
light
the
things
that
have
been
revealed
in
all
former
dispensations
also
other
things
that
have
not
been
before
revealed
another
interesting
feature
of
the
conference
was
the
report
made
by
the
prophet
of
the
church
property
in
his
charge
as
for
the
church
he
also
took
occasion
to
report
the
amount

of

another
matter
of
very
great
importance
and
one
which
has
exercised
a
great
influence
upon
the
course
of
events
in
the
history
of
the
church
and
especially
upon
the
events
of
this
nauvoo
period
belongs
to
the
spring
and
summer
of
and
many
things
of
our
history
will
be
all
the
plainer
if
the
matter
referred
to
be
considered
now
i
refer
to
the
introduction
in
practice
of
the
marriage
system
which
afterwards
obtained
in
the
church
the
chief
and
greatest
feature
of
this
marriage
system
celestial
marriage
it
is
called
by
the
church
because
it
is
the
marriage
system
that
obtains
in
celestial
worlds
is
the
eternity
of
the
marriage
covenant
until
death
us
do
part
is
usually
the
mutual
covenant
of
man
and
woman
in
the
orthodox
christian
marriage
ceremony
that
is
the
marriage
covenant
is
understood
among
christians
generally
as
being
a
matter
that
pertains
to
time
only
the
contract
obligations
ending
with
death
but
this
celestial
marriage
system
of
the
church
regards
the
incident
of
death
not
at
all
but
makes
the
covenant
of
marriage
for
time
and
for
all
eternity
a
covenant
which
is
sealed
and
ratified
by
that
power
of
the
priesthood
in
the
administrator
which
binds
on
earth
and
it
is
bound
in
heaven
that
is
the
covenant
of
marriage
holds
good
through
time
and
will
be
in
effect
and
of
binding
force
in
and
after
the
resurrection
in
other
words
this
marriage
system
regards
man
as
enduring
eternally
and
formulates
his
marriage
covenants
in
harmony
with
that
view
of
him
of
course
this
contemplates
the
continuation
of
the
marriage
state
in
eternity
not
only
the
spiritual
and
intellectual
companionship
but
all
the
relations
of
the
wedded
state
with
the
joys
of
parentage
the
power
of
endless
lives
being
among
the
means
of
exaltation
and
glory
that
this
is
a
view
of
marriage
quite
distinct
from
the
usual
christian
view
goes
without
saying
it
throws
a
new
light
upon
man
future
existence
it
destroys
the
vagueness
which
through
nearly
all
ages
like
a
mystic
pall
has
hidden
the
glory
and
exaltation
destined
for
man
in
the
future
eternities
of
god
it
should
be
said
in
this
connection
that
the
revelations
of
god
to
joseph
smith
even
before
this
marriage
system
was
made
known
held
out
to
man
the
hope
of
a
tangible
future
existence
in
a
resurrected
immortal
body
of
flesh
and
bones
quickened
by
the
spirit
and
clothed
with
the
glory
of
immortal
youth
the
future
life
was
to
be
a
reality
not
a
land
of
shadows
his
heavenly
home
was
to
be
upon
the
earth
after
it
had
become
sanctified
and
made
a
celestial
sphere
his
relations
with
his
kindred
and
friends
were
to
be
of
a
nature
to
satisfy
the
longings
of
the
human
heart
for
society
for
fellowship
and
needed
only
the
revelation
of
this
marriage
system
to
complete
the
circle
of
his
promised
future
felicity
for
grant
to
man
in
his
resurrected
state
a
real
tangible
existence
an
immortal
youth
that
knows
no
pain
or
sickness
or
disease
the
power
to
hive
knowledge
and
wisdom
as
the
centuries
the
millenniums
and
eternities
roll
by
grant
him
the
power
to
build
and
inhabit
to
love
and
be
loved
and
add
to
that
the
power
of
endless
lives
the
power
and
privilege
to
perpetuate
his
race
under
an
eternal
marriage
covenant
grant
this
and
the
future
happiness
exaltation
and
glory
of
man
stands
revealed
as
being
absolutely
without
limitations
and
far
greater
and
beyond
in
majesty
anything
within
our
power
to
conceive
in
our
present
state
of
i
say
that
the
primary
principle
of
the
marriage
system
of
the
church
is
the
eternity
of
the
marriage
covenant
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
system
also
includes
the
doctrine
of
a
plurality
of
wives
the
importance
and
grandeur
of
the
doctrine
of
the
eternity
of
the
marriage
covenant
to
a
very
great
extent
has
been
lost
sight
of
in
the
discussion
of
and
the
popular
clamor
concerning
the
plurality
feature
of
this
new
marriage
system
the
revelation
making
known
this
marriage
doctrine
came
about
in
this
way
first
it
should
be
stated
and
it
is
evident
from
the
written
revelation
itself
which
bears
the
date
of
july
that
the
doctrine
was
revealed
and
the
practice
of
it
began
before
the
partial
revelation
now
in
the
doctrine
and
covenants
was
written
as
early
as
the
rightfulness
of
a
plurality
of
wives
under
certain
conditions
was
made
known
to
joseph
smith
in
the
latter
part
of
that
year
especially
from
november
and
through
the
early
months
of
the
prophet
with
sidney
rigdon
as
his
assistant
was
earnestly
engaged
at
hiram
a
village
in
portage
county
near
kirtland
ohio
in
translating
the
jewish
scripture
it
must
have
been
while
engaged
in
that
work
that
the
evident
approval
of
god
to
the
plural
marriage
system
of
the
ancient
patriarchs
attracted
the
prophet
attention
and
led
him
to
make
those
inquiries
of
the
lord
to
which
the
opening
paragraphs
of
the
written
revelation
refer
viz
verily
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
you
my
servant
joseph
that
inasmuch
as
you
have
inquired
of
my
hand
to
know
and
understand
wherein
i
the
lord
justified
my
servants
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
as
also
moses
david
and
solomon
my
servants
as
touching
the
principle
and
doctrine
of
their
having
many
wives
and
concubines
behold
and
lo
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
will
answer
thee
as
touching
this
matter
the
doctrine
revealed
at
that
time
to
the
prophet
however
was
not
to
be
made
known
to
the
world
but
joseph
did
make
known
what
had
been
revealed
to
him
to
a
few
trusted
friends
among
whom
were
oliver
cowdery
and
lyman
johnson
the
latter
confiding
what
the
prophet
had
taught
him
to
orson
pratt
his
missionary
companion
with
these
and
a
few
other
exceptions
perhaps
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
righteousness
of
this
principle
of
the
future
marriage
system
of
the
church
was
locked
up
in
the
bosom
of
the
prophet
of
god
about
however
the
prophet
began
to
be
moved
upon
to
make
known
the
doctrine
to
others
he
taught
the
principle
to
joseph
bates
noble
for
one
as
early
as
the
fall
of
according
to
the
affidavit
of
noble
given
before
james
jack
a
notary
public
in
and
for
the
county
of
salt
lake
utah
in
june
joseph
smith
declared
to
noble
that
he
had
received
a
revelation
from
god
on
the
subject
and
that
an
angel
of
the
lord
had
commanded
him
joseph
smith
to
move
forward
in
the
said
order
of
marriage
and
further
that
the
said
joseph
smith
requested
him
joseph
noble
to
step
forward
and
assist
him
in
carrying
out
the
said
principle
this
same
man
noble
gives
the
following
affidavit
with
reference
to
the
introduction
of
the
practice
of
this
principle
by
joseph
smith
the
prophet
territory
of

of

be
it
remembered
that
on
this
day
of
june
personally
appeared
before
me
james
jack
a
notary
public
in
and
for
said
county
joseph
bates
noble
who
was
by
me
sworn
in
due
form
of
law
and
upon
his
oath
saith
that
on
the
fifth
day
of
april
at
the
city
of
nauvoo
county
of
hancock
state
of
illinois
he
married
or
sealed
louisa
beaman
to
joseph
smith
president
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
according
to
the
order
of
celestial
marriage
revealed
to
the
said
joseph
smith
signed
joseph
noble
subscribed
and
sworn
to
by
the
said
joseph
bates
noble
the
day
and
year
first
above
written
james
jack
notary
public
the
introduction
of
the
practice
of
plural
marriage
by
the
prophet
then
began
even
before
the
return
of
the
twelve
from
england
on
their
return
joseph
soon
began
to
teach
the
principle
to
them
and
urged
upon
them
the
importance
of
putting
it
into
practice
the
dread
with
which
the
doctrine
was
regarded
the
prejudices
against
it
in
the
hearts
of
those
faithful
men
who
accepted
it
as
a
revelation
from
god
through
the
prophet
are
all
illustrated
in
the
reflections
and
testimony
of
elder
john
taylor
one
of
the
twelve
at
that
time
and
subsequently
the
president
of
the
church
and
here
let
me
repeat
what
i
said
in
his
biography
some
years
ago
the
world
never
made
a
greater
mistake
than
when
it
supposed
that
plural
marriage
was
hailed
with
delight
by
the
elders
who
were
commanded
of
the
lord
to
introduce
its
practice
in
this
generation
they
saw
clearly
that
it
would
bring
additional
reproach
upon
them
from
the
world
that
it
would
run
counter
to
the
traditions
and
prejudices
of
society
as
indeed
it
was
contrary
to
their
own
traditions
that
their
motives
would
be
misunderstood
or
misconstrued
all
this
they
saw
and
naturally
shrunk
from
the
undertaking
required
of
them
by
the
revelation
of
god
and
now
elder
taylor
joseph
smith
told
the
twelve
that
if
this
law
was
not
practiced
if
they
would
not
enter
into
this
covenant
then
the
kingdom
of
god
could
not
go
one
step
further
now
we
did
not
feel
like
preventing
the
kingdom
of
god
from
going
forward
we
professed
to
be
the
apostles
of
the
lord
and
did
not
feel
like
putting
ourselves
in
a
position
to
retard
the
progress
of
the
kingdom
of
god
the
revelation
says
that
all
those
who
have
this
law
revealed
unto
them
must
obey
the
same
now
that
is
not
my
word
i
did
not
make
it
it
was
the
prophet
of
god
who
revealed
that
to
us
in
nauvoo
and
i
bear
witness
of
this
solemn
fact
before
god
that
he
did
reveal
this
sacred
principle
to
me
and
others
of
the
twelve
and
in
this
revelation
it
is
stated
that
it
is
the
will
and
law
of
god
that
all
those
who
have
this
law
revealed
unto
them
must
obey
the
same
i
had
always
entertained
strict
ideas
of
virtue
and
i
felt
as
a
married
man
that
this
was
to
me
outside
of
this
principle
an
appalling
thing
to
do
the
idea
of
going
and
asking
a
young
lady
to
be
married
to
me
when
i
had
already
a
wife
it
was
a
thing
calculated
to
stir
up
feelings
from
the
innermost
depths
of
the
human
soul
i
had
always
entertained
the
strictest
regard
of
chastity
i
had
never
in
my
life
seen
the
time
when
i
have
known
of
a
man
deceiving
a
woman
and
it
is
often
done
in
the
world
where
notwithstanding
the
crime
the
man
is
received
into
society
and
the
poor
woman
is
looked
upon
as
a
pariah
and
an
outcast
i
have
always
looked
upon
such
a
thing
as
infamous
and
upon
such
a
man
as
a
villain
hence
with
the
feelings
i
had
entertained
nothing
but
a
knowledge
of
god
and
the
revelations
of
god
and
the
truth
of
them
could
have
induced
me
to
embrace
such
a
principle
as
this
we
the
twelve
seemed
to
put
off
as
far
as
we
could
what
might
be
termed
the
evil
day
some
time
after
these
things
were
made
known
unto
us
i
was
riding
out
of
nauvoo
on
horseback
and
met
joseph
smith
coming
in
he
too
being
on
horseback
i
bowed
to
joseph
and
having
done
the
same
to
me
he
said
stop
and
he
looked
at
me
very
intently
look
here
said
he
those
things
that
have
been
spoken
of
must
be
fulfilled
and
if
they
are
not
entered
into
right
away
the
keys
will
be
turned
well
what
did
i
do
did
i
feel
to
stand
in
the
way
of
this
great
eternal
principle
and
treat
lightly
the
things
of
god
no
i
replied
brother
joseph
i
will
try
and
carry
these
things
out
so
indeed
he
did
for
within
two
years
in
nauvoo
he
married
elizabeth
haigham
jane
ballantyne
and
mary
oakley
after
this
the
testimony
is
abundant
that
plural
marriage
as
well
as
marriage
for
eternity
was
abundantly
practiced
in
nauvoo
though
the
revelation
which
made
its
rightfulness
known
was
not
written
until
july
i
have
remarked
in
the
opening
of
this
chapter
that
the
consideration
of
this
subject
at
this
period
of
nauvoo
history
would
aid
the
reader
to
understand
more
clearly
many
things
in
the
subsequent
events
we
have
to
relate
it
is
to
be
observed
first
of
all
that
this
principle
of
plural
marriage
had
to
be
introduced
secretly
first
because
of
the
traditions
and
prejudices
of
the
saints
themselves
and
secondly
because
of
the
advantage
that
their
enemies
surrounding
them
would
have
when
once
the
doctrine
was
publicly
proclaimed
this
enforced
secrecy
then
which
a
reasonable
prudence
demanded
gave
rise
to
apparent
contradictions
between
the
public
utterances
of
leading
brethren
in
the
church
and
their
practice
wicked
men
took
advantage
of
the
situation
and
brought
sorrow
to
the
hearts
of
the
innocent
and
reproach
upon
the
church
some
possessed
of
a
zeal
without
wisdom
knowing
of
this
doctrine
hastened
without
authority
to
make
public
proclamation
of
it
and
had
to
be
silenced
as
for
instance
a
number
of
elders
who
were
reproved
by
hyrum
smith
for
preaching
this
doctrine
at
a
branch
of
the
church
at
china
creek
near
nauvoo
and
later
one
hiram
brown
who
did
the
same
thing
in
lapeer
county
michigan
for
which
he
was
disfellowshiped
from
the
church
and
notified
by
joseph
and
hyrum
to
attend
the
conference
in
april
of
that
year
to
give
a
further
account
of
his
proceedings
then
again
there
were
others
who
falsely
taught
that
the
prophet
approved
of
promiscuous
intercourse
between
the
sexes
and
that
there
was
no
sin
in
such
relations
so
long
as
they
were
kept
secret
and
brought
no
scandal
upon
the
community
this
afforded
villains
their
opportunity
and
such
men
as
john
bennett
the
laws
wilson
and
william
foster
the
young
higbees
chancy
and
francis
and
others
to
reap
their
harvest
of
wickedness
there
was
necessarily
enough
of
mystery
in
the
movements
of
the
prophet
and
his
faithful
brethren
connected
with
the
matter
of
plural
marriage
to
give
something
of
color
to
the
false
statements
of
these
wretches
and
hence
many
otherwise
good
people
were
deceived
the
duty
of
the
prophet
and
his
associates
however
to
denounce
this
wickedness
that
had
crept
into
the
church
was
not
shirked
by
the
leading
elders
of
the
church
the
prophet
was
bold
in
his
denunciation
of
the
evil
and
snatched
the
masks
from
the
faces
of
corrupt
men
and
did
all
in
his
power
to
protect
the
innocent
from
the
deceptions
of
the
vicious
though
it
pluck
down
upon
his
own
head
the
vengeful
wrath
of
the
ungodly
with
this
situation
in
mind
i
am
sure
the
reader
will
better
appreciate
the
many
complications
which
follow
in
order
that
the
reader
who
is
a
stranger
to
mormonism
may
see
how
far
the
principle
of
the
eternity
of
the
marriage
covenant
and
the
plural
marriage
system
of
the
church
is
removed
from
the
sensuality
that
is
often
attributed
to
it
i
quote
in
concluding
this
chapter
the
revelation
which
justifies
and
authorized
it
verily
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
you
my
servant
joseph
that
inasmuch
as
you
have
inquired
of
my
hand
to
know
and
understand
wherein
i
the
lord
justified
my
servants
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
as
also
moses
david
and
solomon
my
servants
as
touching
the
principle
and
doctrine
of
their
having
many
wives
and
concubines
behold
and
lo
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
will
answer
thee
as
touching
this
matter
therefore
prepare
thy
heart
to
receive
and
obey
the
instructions
which
i
am
about
to
give
unto
you
for
all
those
who
have
this
law
revealed
unto
them
must
obey
the
same
for
behold
i
reveal
unto
you
a
new
and
everlasting
covenant
and
if
ye
abide
not
that
covenant
then
are
ye
damned
for
no
one
can
reject
this
covenant
and
be
permitted
to
enter
into
my
glory
for
all
who
will
have
a
blessing
at
my
hands
shall
abide
the
law
which
was
appointed
for
that
blessing
and
the
conditions
thereof
as
were
instituted
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
as
pertaining
to
the
new
and
everlasting
covenant
it
was
instituted
for
the
fullness
of
my
glory
and
he
that
receiveth
a
fullness
thereof
must
and
shall
abide
the
law
or
he
shall
be
damned
saith
the
lord
god
and
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
the
conditions
of
this
law
are
these
all
covenants
contracts
bonds
obligations
oaths
vows
performances
connections
associations
or
expectations
that
are
not
made
and
entered
into
and
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
of
him
who
is
anointed
both
as
well
for
time
and
for
all
eternity
and
that
too
most
holy
by
revelation
and
commandment
through
the
medium
of
mine
anointed
whom
i
have
appointed
on
the
earth
to
hold
this
power
and
i
have
appointed
unto
my
servant
joseph
to
hold
this
power
in
the
last
days
and
there
is
never
but
one
on
the
earth
at
a
time
on
whom
this
power
and
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
are
conferred
are
of
no
efficacy
virtue
or
force
in
and
after
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
for
all
contracts
that
are
not
made
unto
this
end
have
an
end
when
men
are
dead
behold
mine
house
is
a
house
of
order
saith
the
lord
god
and
not
a
house
of
confusion
will
i
accept
of
an
offering
saith
the
lord
that
is
not
made
in
my
name
or
will
i
receive
at
your
hands
that
which
i
have
not
appointed
and
will
i
appoint
unto
you
saith
the
lord
except
it
be
by
law
even
as
i
and
my
father
ordained
unto
you
before
the
world
was
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
i
give
unto
you
this
commandment
that
no
man
shall
come
unto
the
father
but
by
me
or
by
my
word
which
is
my
law
saith
the
lord
and
everything
that
is
in
the
world
whether
it
be
ordained
of
men
by
thrones
or
principalities
or
powers
or
things
of
name
whatsoever
they
may
be
that
are
not
by
me
or
by
my
word
saith
the
lord
shall
be
thrown
down
and
shall
not
remain
after
men
are
dead
neither
in
nor
after
the
resurrection
saith
the
lord
your
god
for
whatsoever
things
remain
are
by
me
and
whatsoever
things
are
not
by
me
shall
be
shaken
and
destroyed
therefore
if
a
man
marry
him
a
wife
in
the
world
and
he
marry
her
not
by
me
nor
by
my
word
and
he
covenant
with
her
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
world
and
she
with
him
their
covenant
and
marriage
are
not
of
force
when
they
are
dead
and
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
therefore
they
are
not
bound
by
any
law
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
therefore
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
appointed
angels
in
heaven
which
angels
are
ministering
servants
to
minister
for
those
who
are
worthy
of
a
far
more
and
an
exceeding
and
an
eternal
weight
of
glory
for
these
angels
did
not
abide
my
law
therefore
they
can
not
be
enlarged
but
remain
separately
and
singly
without
exaltation
in
their
saved
condition
to
all
eternity
and
from
henceforth
are
not
gods
but
are
angels
of
god
for
ever
and
ever
and
again
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
a
man
marry
a
wife
and
make
a
covenant
with
her
for
time
and
for
all
eternity
if
that
covenant
is
not
by
me
or
by
my
word
which
is
my
law
and
is
not
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
through
him
whom
i
have
anointed
and
appointed
unto
this
power
then
it
is
not
valid
neither
of
force
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
because
they
are
not
joined
by
me
saith
the
lord
neither
by
my
word
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
it
can
not
be
received
there
because
the
angels
and
the
gods
are
appointed
there
by
whom
they
can
not
pass
they
can
not
therefore
inherit
my
glory
for
my
house
is
a
house
of
order
saith
the
lord
god
and
again
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
a
man
marry
a
wife
by
my
word
which
is
my
law
and
by
the
new
and
everlasting
covenant
and
it
is
sealed
unto
them
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
by
him
who
is
anointed
unto
whom
i
have
appointed
this
power
and
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
and
it
shall
be
said
unto
them
ye
shall
come
forth
in
the
first
resurrection
and
if
it
be
after
the
first
resurrection
in
the
next
resurrection
and
shall
inherit
thrones
kingdoms
principalities
and
powers
dominions
all
heights
and
depths
then
shall
it
be
written
in
the
lamb
book
of
life
that
he
shall
commit
no
murder
whereby
to
shed
innocent
blood
and
if
ye
abide
in
my
covenant
and
commit
no
murder
whereby
to
shed
innocent
blood
it
shall
be
done
unto
them
in
all
things
whatsoever
my
servant
hath
put
upon
them
in
time
and
through
all
eternity
and
shall
be
of
full
force
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
and
they
shall
pass
by
the
angels
and
the
gods
which
are
set
there
to
their
exaltation
and
glory
in
all
things
as
hath
been
sealed
upon
their
heads
which
glory
shall
be
a
fullness
and
a
continuation
of
the
seeds
for
ever
and
ever
then
shall
they
be
gods
because
they
have
no
end
therefore
shall
they
be
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
because
they
continue
then
shall
they
be
above
all
because
all
things
are
subject
unto
them
then
shall
they
be
gods
because
they
have
all
power
and
the
angels
are
subject
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
ye
abide
my
law
ye
can
not
attain
to
this
glory
for
straight
is
the
gate
and
narrow
the
way
that
leadeth
unto
the
exaltation
and
continuation
of
the
lives
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
because
ye
receive
me
not
in
the
world
neither
do
ye
know
me
but
if
ye
receive
me
in
the
world
then
shall
ye
know
me
and
shall
receive
your
exaltation
that
where
i
am
ye
shall
be
also
this
is
eternal
lives
to
know
the
only
wise
and
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
he
hath
sent
i
am
he
receive
ye
therefore
my
law
broad
is
the
gate
and
wide
the
way
that
leadeth
to
the
deaths
and
many
there
are
that
go
in
thereat
because
they
receive
me
not
neither
do
they
abide
in
my
law
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
a
man
marry
a
wife
according
to
my
word
and
they
are
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
according
to
mine
appointment
and
he
or
she
shall
commit
any
sin
or
transgression
of
the
new
and
everlasting
covenant
whatever
and
all
manner
of
blasphemies
and
if
they
commit
no
murder
wherein
they
shed
innocent
blood
yet
they
shall
come
forth
in
the
first
resurrection
and
enter
into
their
exaltation
but
they
shall
be
destroyed
in
the
flesh
and
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
buffetings
of
satan
unto
the
day
of
redemption
saith
the
lord
god
the
blasphemy
against
the
holy
ghost
which
shall
not
be
forgiven
in
the
world
nor
out
of
the
world
is
in
that
ye
commit
murder
wherein
ye
shed
innocent
blood
and
assent
unto
my
death
after
ye
have
received
my
new
and
everlasting
covenant
saith
the
lord
god
and
he
that
abideth
not
this
law
can
in
no
wise
enter
into
my
glory
but
shall
be
damned
saith
the
lord
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
will
give
unto
thee
the
law
of
my
holy
priesthood
as
was
ordained
by
me
and
my
father
before
the
world
was
abraham
received
all
things
whatsoever
he
received
by
revelation
and
commandment
by
my
word
saith
the
lord
and
hath
entered
into
his
exaltation
and
sitteth
upon
his
throne
abraham
received
promises
concerning
his
seed
and
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins
from
whose
loins
ye
are
namely
my
servant
joseph
which
were
to
continue
so
long
as
they
were
in
the
world
and
as
touching
abraham
and
his
seed
out
of
the
world
they
should
continue
both
in
the
world
and
out
of
the
world
should
they
continue
as
innumerable
as
the
stars
or
if
ye
were
to
count
the
sand
upon
the
sea
shore
ye
could
not
number
them
this
promise
is
yours
also
because
ye
are
of
abraham
and
the
promise
was
made
unto
abraham
and
by
this
law
are
the
continuation
of
the
works
of
my
father
wherein
he
glorifieth
himself
go
ye
therefore
and
do
the
works
of
abraham
enter
ye
into
my
law
and
ye
shall
be
saved
but
if
ye
enter
not
into
my
law
ye
can
not
receive
the
promise
of
my
father
which
he
made
unto
abraham
god
commanded
abraham
and
sarah
gave
hagar
to
abraham
to
wife
and
why
did
she
do
it
because
this
was
the
law
and
from
hagar
sprang
many
people
this
therefore
was
fulfilling
among
other
things
the
promises
was
abraham
therefore
under
condemnation
verily
i
say
unto
you
nay
for
i
the
lord
commanded
it
abraham
was
commanded
to
offer
his
son
isaac
nevertheless
it
was
written
thou
shalt
not
kill
abraham
however
did
not
refuse
and
it
was
accounted
unto
him
for
righteousness
abraham
received
concubines
and
they
bear
him
children
and
it
was
accounted
unto
him
for
righteousness
because
they
were
given
unto
him
and
he
abode
in
my
law
as
isaac
also
and
jacob
did
none
other
things
than
that
which
they
were
commanded
and
because
they
did
none
other
things
than
that
which
they
were
commanded
they
have
entered
into
their
exaltation
according
to
the
promises
and
sit
upon
thrones
and
are
not
angels
but
are
gods
david
also
received
many
wives
and
concubines
as
also
solomon
and
moses
my
servants
as
also
many
others
of
my
servants
from
the
beginning
of
creation
until
this
time
and
in
nothing
did
they
sin
save
in
those
things
which
they
received
not
of
me
david
wives
and
concubines
were
given
unto
him
of
me
by
the
hand
of
nathan
my
servant
and
others
of
the
prophets
who
had
the
keys
of
this
power
and
in
none
of
these
things
did
he
sin
against
me
save
in
the
case
of
uriah
and
his
wife
and
therefore
he
hath
fallen
from
his
exaltation
and
received
his
portion
and
he
shall
not
inherit
them
out
of
the
world
for
i
gave
them
unto
another
saith
the
lord
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
i
gave
unto
thee
my
servant
joseph
an
appointment
and
restore
all
things
ask
what
ye
will
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
according
to
my
word
and
as
ye
have
asked
concerning
adultery
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
a
man
receiveth
a
wife
in
the
new
and
everlasting
covenant
and
if
she
be
with
another
man
and
i
have
not
appointed
unto
her
by
the
holy
anointing
she
hath
committed
adultery
and
shall
be
destroyed
if
she
be
not
in
the
new
and
everlasting
covenant
and
she
be
with
another
man
she
has
committed
adultery
and
if
her
husband
be
with
another
woman
and
he
was
under
a
vow
he
hath
broken
his
vow
and
hath
committed
adultery
and
if
she
hath
not
committed
adultery
but
is
innocent
and
hath
not
broken
her
vow
and
she
knoweth
it
and
i
reveal
it
unto
you
my
servant
joseph
then
shall
you
have
power
by
the
power
of
my
holy
priesthood
to
take
her
and
give
her
unto
him
that
hath
not
committed
adultery
but
hath
been
faithful
for
he
shall
be
made
ruler
over
many
for
i
have
conferred
upon
you
the
keys
and
power
of
the
priesthood
wherein
i
restore
all
things
and
make
known
unto
you
all
things
in
due
time
and

given
unto

that
she
stay
herself

you
all
as
i
did
abraham
and
that
i
might
require
an
offering
at
your
hand
by

and
let
mine

emma
smith
receive
all
those
that
have
been
given
to
my
servant
joseph
and
who
are
virtuous
and
pure
before
me
and
those
who
are
not

said
they
were
pure

be
destroyed
saith
the
lord
god
for
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
ye
shall
obey
my
voice
and
i
give
unto
you
my
servant
joseph
that
he
shall
be
made
ruler
over
many
things
for
he
hath
been
faithful
over
a
few
things
and
from
henceforth
i
will
strengthen
him
and
i
command
mine
handmaid
emma
smith
to
abide
and
cleave
unto
my
servant
joseph
and
to
none
else
but
if
she
will
not
abide
this
commandment
she
shall
be
destroyed
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
will
destroy
her
if
she
abide
not
in
my
law
but
if
she
will
not
abide
this
commandment
then
shall
my
servant
joseph
do
all
things
for
her
even
as
he
hath
said
and
i
will
bless
him
and
multiply
him
and
give
unto
him
an

the
eternal

again
verily
i
say
let
mine
handmaid
forgive
my
servant
joseph
his
trespasses
and
then
shall
she
be
forgiven
her
trespasses
wherein
she
has
trespassed
against
me
and
i
the
lord
thy
god
will
bless
her
and
multiply
her
and
make
her
heart
to
rejoice
and
again
i
say
let
not
my
servant
joseph
put
his
property
out
of
his
hands
lest
an
enemy
come
and
destroy
him
for
satan
seeketh
to
destroy
for
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
and
he
is
my
servant
and
behold
and
lo
i
am
with
him
as
i
was
with
abraham
thy
father
even
unto
his
exaltation
and
glory
now
as
touching
the
law
of
the
priesthood
there
are
many
things
pertaining
thereunto
verily
if
a
man
be
called
of
my
father
as
was
aaron
by
mine
own
voice
and
by
the
voice
of
him
that
sent
me
and
i
have
endowed
him
with
the
keys
of
the
power
of
this
priesthood
if
he
do
anything
in
my
name
and
according
to
my
law
and
by
my
word
he
will
not
commit
sin
and
i
will
justify
him
let
no
one
therefore
set
on
my
servant
joseph
for
i
will
justify
him
for
he
shall
do
the
sacrifice
which
i
require
at
his
hands
for
his
transgressions
saith
the
lord
your
god
and
again
as
pertaining
to
the
law
of
the
priesthood
if
any
man
espouse
a
virgin
and
desire
to
espouse
another
and
the
first
give
her
consent
and
if
he
espouse
the
second
and
they
are
virgins
and
have
vowed
to
no
other
man
then
he
is
justified
he
can
not
commit
adultery
for
they
are
given
unto
him
for
he
can
not
commit
adultery
with
that
that
belongeth
unto
him
and
to
no
one
else
and
if
he
have
ten
virgins
given
unto
him
by
this
law
he
can
not
commit
adultery
for
they
belong
to
him
and
they
are
given
unto
him
therefore
is
he
justified
but
if
one
or
either
of
the
ten
virgins
after
she
is
espoused
shall
be
with
another
man
she
has
committed
adultery
and
shall
be
destroyed
for
they
are
given
unto
him
to
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
according
to
my
commandment
and
to
fulfill
the
promise
which
was
given
by
my
father
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
for
their
exaltation
in
the
eternal
worlds
that
they
may
bear
the
souls
of
men
for
herein
is
the
work
of
my
father
continued
that
he
may
be
glorified
and
again
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
any
man
have
a
wife
who
holds
the
keys
of
this
power
and
he
teaches
unto
her
the
law
of
my
priesthood
as
pertaining
to
these
things
then
shall
she
believe
and
administer
unto
him
or
she
shall
be
destroyed
saith
the
lord
your
god
for
i
will
destroy
her
for
i
will
magnify
my
name
upon
all
those
who
receive
and
abide
in
my
law
therefore
it
shall
be
lawful
in
me
if
she
receive
not
this
law
for
him
to
receive
all
things
whatsoever
i
the
lord
his
god
will
give
unto
him
because
she
did
not
administer
unto
him
according
to
my
word
and
she
then
becomes
the
transgressor
and
he
is
exempt
from
the
law
of
sarah
who
administered
unto
abraham
according
to
the
law
when
i
commanded
abraham
to
take
hagar

camp
bankruptcy
among
the
most
despicable
occupations
that
men
engage
in
that
of
camp
follower
holds
a
front
rank
by
plundering
the
dead
by
the
practice
of
extortion
upon
the
living
by
taking
advantage
of
the
license
and
reign
of
terror
that
follows
in
the
wake
of
an
army
the
camp
follower
plunders
the
terrified
people
not
unfrequently
claiming
to
be
authorized
by
the
commanders
of
the
army
in
order
to
be
more
successful
in
his
rapine
thus
he
seeks
to
enrich
himself
upon
the
misfortunes
and
terrors
of
others
and
at
the
expense
of
the
reputation
of
armies
and
their
commanders
more
loathsome
are
such
characters
than
the
vultures
that
hover
about
the
fields
made
red
by
human
gore
to
glut
themselves
upon
the
festering
swollen
bodies
of
the

yet
more
to
be
despised
than
the

follower
is
that
man
who
will
attach
himself
to
a
religious
association
with
a
view
of
profiting
in
schemes
of
villainy
and
when
discovered
in
his
crimes
throws
the
responsibility
of
his
evil
doing
upon
the
leaders
of
said
association
claiming
that
his
crimes
have
been
taught
to
him
as
a
part
of
his
religion
such
men
are
wholesale
character
assassins
for
by
their
deeds
virtuous
communities
are
brought
into
disrepute
and
reproach
is
cast
upon
their
religion
some
such
characters
had
attached
themselves
to
the
saints
in
nauvoo
and
vicinity
and
gave
a
coloring
to
the
charges
that
were
made
against
the
church
to
the
effect
that
the
leaders
thereof
sanctioned
stealing
so
long
as
it
was
practiced
on
the
gentiles
those
not
belonging
to
the
church
such
were
the
rumors
given
out
by
some
members
of
the
church
engaged
in
this
infamous
business
on
the
eighteenth
of
november
a
nest
of
such
vipers
was
uncovered
at
ramus
near
nauvoo
and
they
were
promptly
excommunicated
from
the
church
by
the
apostles
who
were
holding
a
conference
at
the
place
on
the
date
above
mentioned
both
joseph
and
hyrum
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
make
affidavits
before
proper
officers
of
the
law
to
the
effect
that
they
had
never
given
their
sanction
to
such
infamous
doctrine
as
that
attributed
to
them
and
the
twelve
apostles
in
an
epistle
to
the
public
disavowed
ever
sanctioning
the
crime
of
theft
hyrum
in
his
affidavit
says
i
hereby
disavow
any
sanction
or
approbation
by
me
of
the
crime
of
theft
or
any
other
evil
practice
in
any
person
or
persons
whatever
whereby
either
the
lives
or
property
of
our
may
be
unlawfully
taken
or
molested
neither
are
such
doings
sanctioned
or
approbated
by
the
first
presidency
or
any
other
persons
in
authority
or
good
standing
in
the
church
but
such
acts
are
altogether
in
violation
of
the
rules
order
and
regulations
of
the
church
contrary
to
the
teachings
given
in
said
church
and
the
laws
of
both
god
and
man
in
a
public
declaration
to
which
joseph
appended
his
affidavit
the
prophet
said
it
has
been
proclaimed
upon
the
housetops
and
in
the
secret
chamber
in
the
public
walks
and
private
circles
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
vast
continent
that
stealing
by
the
saints
has
received
my
approval
nay
that
i
have
taught
them
the
doctrine
encouraged
them
in
plunder
and
led
on
the
van
than
which
nothing
is
more
foreign
from
my
heart
i
disfellowship
the
perpetrators
of
all
such
abominations
they
are
devils
and
not
saints
totally
unfit
for
the
society
of
christians
or
men
it
is
true
that
some
professing
to
be
saints
have
taught
such
vile
heresies
but
all
are
not
israel
that
are
of
israel
and
i
want
it
distinctly
understood
in
all
coming
time
that
the
church
over
which
i
have
the
honor
of
presiding
will
ever
set
its
brows
like
brass
and
its
face
like
steel
against
all
such
abominable
acts
of
villainy
and
crime
nor
were
the
twelve
less
forcible
in
denouncing
this
iniquity
in
an
epistle
printed
at
the
same
time
with
the
above
they
said
we
know
not
how
to
express
our
abhorrence
of
such
an
idea
and
can
only
say
it
is
engendered
in
hell
founded
in
falsehood
and
is
the
offspring
of
the
devil
that
it
is
at
variance
with
every
principle
of
righteousness
and
truth
and
will
damn
all
that
are
connected
with
it
we
further
call
upon
the
church
to
bring
all
such
characters
before
the
authorities
that
they
may
be
tried
and
dealt
with
according
to
the
law
of
god
and
delivered
up
to
the
laws
of
the
land
about
this
time
too
there
were
gangs
of
robbers
operating
up
and
down
the
mississippi
river
from
which
the
saints
suffered
as
many
of
their
horses
and
cattle
were
stolen
but
more
serious
injury
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
acts
of
these
robbers
were
attributed
to
the
saints
themselves
and
did
much
to
prejudice
the
minds
of
the
public
against
them
in
the
month
of
december
the
attempt
to
build
up
the
town
of
warren
located
one
mile
south
of
warsaw
was
abandoned
as
early
as
the
fall
of
daniel
witter
a
man
owning
a
sawmill
at
warsaw
held
out
inducements
to
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
to
settle
at
or
in
the
vicinity
of
warsaw
but
the
location
where
the
saints
built
up
nauvoo
was
considered
preferable
still
witter
aldrich
warren
and
others
continued
to
solicit
the
authorities
of
the
church
to
make
an
attempt
to
build
up
a
city
near
warsaw
and
finally
in
the
spring
of
an
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
church
authorities
and
witter
warren
and
aldrich
owners
of
the
school
section
located
just
south
of
warsaw
by
which
any
of
the
saints
settling
on
this
school
section
already
surveyed
into
town
lots
and
called
warren
were
to
have
certain
privileges
granted
them
in
september
willard
richards
was
located
at
warsaw
and
made
what
preparations
he
could
to
receive
settlers
some
few
families
of
saints
gathered
there
and
in
november
two
hundred
and
four
emigrants
from
england
were
counseled
to
locate
in
that
vicinity
but
no
sooner
had
preparations
to
build
up
the
place
been
made
than
the
citizens
of
warsaw
attempted
to
form
an
association
and
manifested
other
symptoms
of
an
unfriendly
character
they
raised
the
rents
witter
himself
raised
one
dollar
per
barrel
on
flour
while
aldrich
forbade
the
people
using
the
old
wood
on
the
school
section
these
unfriendly
demonstrations
led
to
the
abandonment
of
the
enterprise
of
building
up
warren
and
the
church
authorities
promptly
advised
the
saints
who
had
located
there
to
remove
to
nauvoo
the
winter
of
was
a
busy
one
for
joseph
and
those
who
labored
with
him
as
his
scribes
he
read
the
of
the
book
of
mormon
previous
to
its
being
stereotyped
and
prepared
that
concise
yet
admirable
historical
sketch
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
church
together
with
a
summary
of
the
principles
it
teaches
now
known
as
the
articles
of
faith
for
wentworth
of
chicago
who
was
writing
a
history
of
illinois
he
also
prepared
for
publication
his
translation
of
the
book
of
abraham
from
egyptian
papyrus
and
which
in
its
importance
as
a
record
of
the
ancient
saints
brought
to
light
in
this
age
stands
only
second
to
the
book
of
mormon
the
egyptian
papyrus
came
into
the
possession
of
the
prophet
through
one
michael
chandler
who
was
travelling
through
ohio
exhibiting
several
egyptian
mummies
and
rolls
of
papyrus
that
were
found
in
the
coffin
containing
the
mummies
chandler
claimed
to
have
obtained
the
egyptian
treasures
as
a
bequest
from
an
uncle
who
had
traveled
in
egypt
but
it
matters
little
how
chandler
came
into
possession
of
the
mummies
the
saints
in
kirtland
purchased
them
and
the
two
rolls
of
papyrus
proved
to
be
the
writings
of
abraham
and
of
joseph
who
was
sold
into
egypt
and
the
record
of
abraham
at
least
in
part
was
translated
and
published
by
the
prophet
its
importance
is
of
the
character
above
stated
these
labors
together
with
instructing
the
saints
attending
debating
schools
laboring
in
the
city
council
and
organizing
and
instructing
women
relief
societies
occupied
the
attention
of
the
prophet
until
the
opening
of
spring
meantime
nauvoo
had
been
rapidly
building
up
work
on
the
temple
and
nauvoo
house
was
being
pushed
with
considerable
vigor
and
many
neat
cottages
had
taken
the
place
of
the
rude
temporary
cabins
that
had
been
constructed
to
shelter
the
people
until
their
industry
could
win
better
homes
the
population
in
the
spring
of
was
between
eight
and
ten
thousand
the
stream
of
emigration
from
the
british
mission
by
that
time
had
commenced
to
flow
in
and
the
new
citizens
assisted
in
no
small
degree
to
increase
the
prosperity
of
this
central
gathering
place
of
the
saints
but
the
church
had
passed
through
a
long
period
of
disaster
time
and
again
the
early
members
of
the
church
had
been
driven
away
from
their
homes
and
while
their
faith
in
their
religion
remained
unshaken
these
frequent
drivings
and
mobbings
stripped
them
of
their
property
and
of
course
ruined
their
financial
schemes
and
though
their
prospects
at
nauvoo
began
to
brighten
the
people
were
constantly
plagued
by
the
presentation
of
old
claims
upon
them
their
creditors
making
small
or
no
allowance
for
the
disasters
which
had
overtaken
them
this
was
a
constant
draft
upon
their
resources
and
a
great
hindrance
to
the
growth
of
nauvoo
finally
as
a
means
of
protection
against
unreasonable
importunate
creditors
a
number
of
the
leading
brethren
among
them
the
prophet
joseph
took
advantage
of
the
bankrupt
law
under
this
law
any
one
owing
a
certain
amount
more
than
he
was
able
to
pay
made
out
a
schedule
of
his
property
and
likewise
of
his
debts
and
placed
both
in
the
hands
of
an
assignee
who
paid
his
creditors
whatever
percentage
of
his
debts
his
property
amounted
to
and
the
assignor
could
start
again
without
being
compelled
to
pay
any
of
the
old
claims
held
against
him
previous
to
his
declared
insolvency
in
whatever
light
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
brethren
may
appear
at
first
sight
an
examination
into
all
the
circumstances
will
reveal
the
fact
that
as
a
means
of
it
became
absolutely
necessary
they
were
financially
down
and
before
they
could
rise
to
their
feet
inexorable
creditors
were
upon
them
to
take
away
their
substance
if
it
is
possible
for
an
individual
or
a
company
to
be
justified
in
taking
advantage
of
the
bankrupt
law
then
the
mormon
leaders
were
there
was
no
effort
on
the
part
of
those
who
took
advantage
of
the
bankrupt
law
to
defraud
their
creditors
to
parties
with
whom
joseph
had
contracted
for
lands
he
wrote
that
he
still
considered
his
contracts
with
them
as
good
and
in
the
case
of
the
hotchkiss
purchase
he
proposed
to
renew
the
contract
this
step
placed
the
brethren
beyond
the
power
of
their
unjust
creditors
and
necessity
compelled
the
action
footnotes

suspicions
of

as
early
as
january
joseph
as
of
the
legion
issued
orders
for
a
general
military
parade
and
review
of
the
legion
to
take
place
on
the
seventh
of
may
following
a
subsequent
order
issued
in
april
marking
out
the
programme
for
the
day
exercises
contained
the
following
clause
at
three
the
cohorts
will
separate
and
form
in
line
of
battle
the
brigadiers
assume
their
respective
commands
and
general
law
command
cavalry
will
make
a
descent
upon
that
of
general
rich
cohort
c
infantry
in
order
of
sham
battle
the
had
invited
the
consolidated
staff
of
the
legion
to
partake
of
a
on
the
occasion
at
his
house
on
the
morning
of
the
day
appointed
for
the
drill
and
review
two
thousand
troops
were
in
the
field
and
an
immense
concourse
of
spectators
both
of
saints
and
strangers
such
was
the
interests
taken
in
the
movement
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
that
a
number
of
the
prominent
men
of
the
state
within
reach
of
the
city
attended
the
review
judge
stephen
douglass
adjourned
the
circuit
court
then
in
session
at
the
county
seat
carthage
in
order
to
attend
as
soon
as
the
heard
of
the
presence
of
judge
douglass
he
sent
him
an
invitation
to
attend
the
military
dinner
given
at
his
house
which
the
judge
accepted
it
was
a
glorious
day
passing
off
without
noise
or
disorder
and
even
the
strangers
expressed
themselves
as
highly
satisfied
with
what
they
had
witnessed
but
even
during
the
brightest
days
clouds
will
sometimes
drift
across
the
sun
disc
so
in
the
moments
of
man
supreme
happiness
it
often
occurs
that
shadows
arise
to
alarm
his
fears
and
remind
him
how
fleeting
are
the
joys
of
this
life
some
drops
of
joy
with
draughts
of
ill
between
some
gleams
of
sunshine
renewing
storms
are
all
that
he
may
hope
for
so
was
it
with
the
principal
founder
of
nauvoo
on
the
day
of
the
sham
battle
when
the
respective
cohorts
were
drawn
up
in
line
of
battle
facing
each
other
john
bennett
rode
up
to
general
smith
and
asked
him
to
lead
the
charge
of
the
first
cohort
but
joseph
declined
he
next
asked
him
to
take
a
position
in
the
rear
of
the
cavalry
without
his
staff
during
the
engagement
but
against
this
captain
rockwood
the
commander
of
joseph
life
guard
objected
and
joseph
with
his
staff
chose
his
own
position
of
this
incident
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
referred
to
this
parade
and
sham
battle
joseph
remarks
if
general
bennett
true
feelings
towards
me
are
not
made
manifest
to
the
world
in
a
very
short
time
then
it
may
be
possible
that
the
gentle
breathings
of
that
spirit
which
whispered
to
me
on
parade
that
there
was
mischief
in
that
sham
battle
were
false
a
short
time
will
determine
the
point
let
john
bennett
answer
at
the
day
of
judgment
why
did
you
request
me
to
command
one
of
the
cohorts
and
also
to
take
my
position
without
my
staff
during
the
sham
battle
on
the
seventh
of
may
where
my
life
might
have
been
forfeited
and
no
man
have
known
who
did
the
deed
this
is
about
the
first
intimation
that
we
have
in
any
of
the
church
records
of
john
bennett
disaffection
towards
joseph
or
the
church
two
years
before
he
had
come
to
nauvoo
then
commerce
filled
with
that
fiery
zeal
for
the
holy
faith
which
is
only
known
to
the
convert
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
learning
and
ability
and
devoted
himself
assiduously
to
bring
to
pass
the
prosperity
of
nauvoo
he
was
of
great
service
to
joseph
as
a
lieutenant
and
the
prophet
was
wont
to
say
of
him
that
he
was
about
the
first
man
he
had
about
him
who
could
do
exactly
what
he
wanted
done
the
way
it
should
be
done
and
who
would
do
it
at
once
in
training
the
legion
and
assisting
in
the
drafting
of
the
nauvoo
and
other
charters
he
had
rendered
invaluable
service
and
had
he
possessed
qualities
of
heart
equal
to
those
of
his
mind
he
was
calculated
to
have
been
a
valuable
acquisition
to
the
city
of
nauvoo
nor
am
i
willing
to
believe
that
his
motives
in
uniting
himself
with
the
church
were
altogether
evil
notwithstanding
his
life
previous
to
his
joining
the
church
was
immoral
i
am
quite
willing
to
believe
that
when
he
came
to
the
saints
it
was
his
determination
to
reform
and
win
for
himself
an
honorable
standing
among
his
but
the
evil
habits
he
had
contracted
were
too
strong
for
his
will
and
he
sought
the
gratification
of
his
lusts
which
led
to
his
fall
soon
after
he
settled
at
nauvoo
he
paid
his
addresses
to
a
respectable
young
lady
of
the
city
and
she
believing
him
to
be
an
honorable
man
accepted
them
and
he
promised
to
marry
her
in
the
meantime
however
joseph
had
received
information
from
the
vicinity
of
bennett
former
residence
to
the
effect
that
the
doctor
was
a
wicked
man
and
that
he
had
a
wife
and
several
children
in
mcconnellsville
morgan
county
ohio
a
thing
the
doctor
had
kept
concealed
learning
this
joseph
persuaded
him
to
discontinue
his
attentions
to
the
young
lady
but
he
soon
renewed
them
whereupon
joseph
threatened
to
expose
him
if
he
did
not
desist
which
to
all
appearances
had
the
desired
effect
being
foiled
in
his
advances
toward
this
young
lady
and
finding
that
joseph
stood
like
a
lion
in
his
path
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
his
evil
designs
and
protect
the
unsuspecting
he
drew
around
him
a
covering
of
hypocrisy
carefully
concealed
his
movements
from
the
prophet
and
proceeded
to
teach
some
women
who
only
knew
him
as
an
honorable
man
that
promiscuous
intercourse
of
the
sexes
was
a
doctrine
believed
in
by
the
saints
and
that
there
was
no
harm
in
it
in
his
first
efforts
he
was
unsuccessful
but
in
his
subsequent
advice
in
the
same
line
he
told
them
that
joseph
and
others
of
the
church
authorities
both
sanctioned
and
practiced
this
wickedness
saying
that
the
prophet
only
denounced
such
things
so
vehemently
in
public
because
of
the
prejudice
of
the
people
and
the
trouble
it
might
create
in
his
own
house
in
this
manner
he
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
scruples
of
some
of
his
dupes
and
seduced
several
females
nor
did
the
evil
end
here
bennett
induced
other
men
to
adopt
his
evil
practices
among
them
francis
and
chauncy
higbee
these
men
repeated
the
assertions
made
by
the
doctor
and
thus
the
evil
spread
and
the
reputation
of
the
prophet
was
being
undermined
but
evils
of
this
character
can
not
long
be
practiced
without
coming
to
light
and
doctor
bennett
finding
that
his
corruption
was
about
to
be
uncovered
began
to
prepare
for
the
shock
when
confronted
with
positive
evidence
that
it
was
known
that
he
had
a
wife
and
family
and
that
his
seductions
were
also
known
he
attempted
suicide
by
taking
poison
and
resisted
the
administration
of
antidotes
but
he
was
rescued
from
this
fate
in
spite
of
himself
before
his
evil
course
was
known
arrangements
were
made
to
run
the
doctor
for
representative
from
the
district
in
which
nauvoo
was
included
to
the
state
legislature
but
one
day
joseph
met
the
doctor
in
the
presence
of
squire
wells
and
addressed
him
in
substance
as
follows
doctor
i
can
sustain
you
no
longer
hyrum
is
against
you
the
twelve
are
against
you
and
if
i
do
not
come
out
against
sin
and
iniquity
i
shall
myself
be
trodden
under
foot
as
a
prophet
of
god
that
sentence
sounded
the
death
knell
to
the
standing
of
bennett
in
nauvoo
joseph
had
clung
to
him
in
the
hope
of
reforming
him
but
that
could
no
longer
be
expected
and
when
the
prophet
let
go
his
hold
upon
him
there
was
nothing
could
avert
his
downfall
on
the
nineteenth
of
may
bennett
resigned
his
position
as
mayor
and
joseph
was
elected
to
that
office
on
this
occasion
and
before
the
whole
city
council
joseph
asked
doctor
bennett
if
he
had
anything
against
him
to
which
the
doctor
replied
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
the
heads
of
the
church
know
what
they
are
about
i
expect
i
have
no
difficulty
with
the
heads
of
the
church
i
publicly
avow
that
if
any
one
has
said
that
i
have
stated
that
general
joseph
smith
has
given
me
authority
to
hold
illicit
intercourse
with
women
he
is
a
liar
in
the
face
of
god
those
who
have
said
it
are
damned
liars
they
are
infernal
liars
he
never
either
in
public
or
private
gave
me
any
such
authority
or
license
and
any
person
who
states
it
is
a
scoundrel
and
a
liar
i
intend
to
continue
with
you
and
hope
the
time
may
come
when
i
may
be
restored
to
full
confidence
and
fellowship
and
my
former
standing
in
the
church
and
that
my
conduct
may
be
such
as
to
warrant
my
restoration
and
should
the
time
ever
come
that
i
may
have
the
opportunity
to
test
my
faith
it
will
then
be
known
whether
i
am
a
traitor
or
a
true
man
will
you
please
state
definitely
whether
you
know
anything
against
my
character
either
in
public
or
private
i
do
not
in
all
my
intercourse
with
general
smith
in
public
and
in
private
he
has
been
strictly
virtuous
in
addition
to
this
statement
before
the
city
council
doctor
bennett
made
affidavit
before
squire
wells
to
the
same
effect
as
the
above
on
the
of
may
the
case
of
bennett
came
up
in
the
masonic
lodge
of
which
the
doctor
was
a
member
as
were
also
nearly
all
the
principal
men
of
nauvoo
in
the
presence
of
one
hundred
of
the
fraternity
he
confessed
his
licentious
practices
and
acknowledged
that
he
was
worthy
of
the
severest
chastisement
yet
he
pleaded
for
mercy
and
especially
that
he
might
not
be
published
in
the
papers
so
deep
apparently
was
his
sorrow
that
joseph
pleaded
for
mercy
in
his
behalf
and
he
was
forgiven
as
a
mason
but
previous
to
this
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
the
twelve
and
the
bishop
had
sent
a
formal
notice
to
him
that
they
could
not
fellowship
him
as
a
member
of
the
church
but
they
withheld
the
matter
from
publication
at
his
earnest
solicitation
because
of
his
mother
john
bennett
however
had
fallen
too
far
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
his
deep
transgression
he
suddenly
left
nauvoo
and
soon
afterward
was
found
plotting
with
the
enemies
of
the
saints
for
the
destruction
of
the
church
by
this
time
the
masonic
lodge
found
that
he
was
an
expelled
mason
and
had
palmed
himself
off
on
the
nauvoo
lodge
as
a
mason
in
regular
standing
consequently
he
was
disfellowshiped
from
the
nauvoo
lodge
and
was
also
cashiered
by
the
of
the
nauvoo
legion
and
thus
plucked
of
all
his
glory
he
was
left
to
wander
as
a
vagabond
and
an
outcast
among
men
after
he
so
suddenly
left
nauvoo
he
again
said
that
the
prophet
joseph
had
authorized
and
encouraged
sexual
wickedness
and
when
confronted
with
his
own
affidavit
which
declared
joseph
to
be
a
virtuous
man
and
a
teacher
of
righteousness
and
upright
both
in
his
public
and
private
character
he
claimed
that
he
was
under
duress
when
he
made
that
affidavit
but
squire
wells
before
whom
he
had
qualified
to
make
his
sworn
statement
went
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
made
affidavit
that
during
the
time
that
this
development
of
his
wickedness
was
going
on
and
he
making
statements
favorable
to
joseph
and
the
church
that
during
all
this
time
if
he
doctor
bennett
was
under
duress
or
fear
he
must
have
had
a
good
faculty
of
concealing
it
for
he
was
at
liberty
to
go
and
come
when
and
where
he
pleased
so
far
as
i
am
capable
of
judging
squire
wells
further
testifies
in
the
same
statement
i
was
always
personally
friendly
with
him
after
i
became
acquainted
with
him
i
never
heard
him
say
anything
derogatory
to
the
character
of
joseph
smith
until
after
he
had
been
exposed
by
said
smith
on
the
public
stand
in
nauvoo
so
soon
as
it
was
learned
that
the
doctor
had
left
nauvoo
and
was
operating
for
the
destruction
of
the
church
the
whole
case
was
published
in
the
nauvoo
papers
and
his
corruption
made
known
to
the
world
those
whom
he
had
involved
in
his
vile
snares
both
men
and
women
were
brought
before
the
proper
tribunals
of
the
church
some
of
them
were
disfellowshiped
and
others
who
sincerely
repented
were
forgiven
the
only
description
i
have
seen
of
doctor
bennett
is
given
in
the
essex
county
published
in
salem
massachusetts
and
that
is
contained
in
the
issue
of
the
fifteenth
of
september
according
to
that
description
he
was
a
man
five
feet
nine
inches
high
well
formed
black
hair
sprinkled
with
grey
dark
complexion
a
rather
thin
face
and
black
restless
eyes
the
fall
of
doctor
bennett
added
another
evidence
to
the
fact
that
neither
natural
nor
acquired
attainments
however
brilliant
they
may
be
can
secure
one
a
safe
standing
in
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
when
not
accompanied
with
righteousness
of
life
moreover
experience
has
proven
that
to
brilliancy
of
intellect
highly
cultivated
may
be
added
inspired
dreams
visions
the
revelations
of
god
and
the
visitation
of
angels
and
yet
if
the
daily
life
and
conversation
runs
not
hand
in
hand
with
righteousness
these
things
furnish
at
best
but
an
insecure
foundation
on
which
to
stand
chapter
xxiii
attempted
assassination
of
governor
boggs
it
was
rumored
in
nauvoo
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
may
that
boggs
of
missouri
had
been
assassinated
by
an
unknown
hand
at
his
residence
in
independence
jackson
county
missouri
the
however
did
not
die
from
the
wounds
he
received
but
recovered
in
the
course
of
several
days
the
assault
made
upon
him
by
his
enemy
whoever
he
might
be
occurred
on
the
sixth
of
may
in
the
year
above
named
he
was
seated
in
a
room
by
himself
when
some
person
discharged
a
pistol
loaded
with
buckshot
through
the
adjoining
window
three
of
the
shot
took
effect
in
his
head
one
of
which
it
was
said
penetrated
his
brain
his
son
hearing
the
shot
burst
into
the
room
and
found
him
in
a
helpless
condition
the
pistol
from
which
the
shot
was
fired
was
found
under
the
window
and
there
too
were
the
footprints
of
the
assassin
no
sooner
was
the
news
of
the
affair
heard
than
speculation
was
rife
as
to
the
parties
who
had
perpetrated
the
deed
and
in
consequence
of
the
infamous
part
taken
by
boggs
in
driving
the
saints
from
the
state
of
missouri
during
the
period
that
he
was
governor
it
was
not
long
before
joe
smith
and
the
mormons
were
accused
of
the
deed
the
quincy
in
its
issue
of
may
said
there
are
several
rumors
in
circulation
in
regard
to
the
horrid
affair
one
of
which
throws
the
crime
upon
the
mormons
from
the
fact
we
suppose
that
boggs
was
governor
at
the
time
and
in
no
small
degree
instrumental
in
driving
them
from
the
state
smith
too
the
mormon
prophet
as
we
understand
prophesied
a
year
or
so
ago
his
death
by
violent
means
hence
there
is
plenty
of
foundation
for
rumor
to
this
statement
the
prophet
joseph
wrote
a
reply
and
sent
it
to
the
editor
of
the
bartlett
dear
sir
in
your
paper
of
the
may
you
have
done
me
manifest
injustice
in
ascribing
to
me
a
prediction
of
the
demise
of
lilburn
boggs
of
missouri
by
violent
hands
boggs
was
a
candidate
for
the
state
senate
and
i
presume
fell
by
the
hand
of
a
political
opponent
with
his
hands
and
face
yet
dripping
with
the
blood
of
murder
but
he
died
not
through
my
instrumentality
my
hands
are
clean
and
my
heart
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
men
as
soon
as
boggs
recovered
sufficiently
he
went
before
samuel
weston
a
justice
of
the
peace
at
independence
and
one
of
the
characters
that
some
of
my
readers
of
the
missouri
persecutions
will
remember
as
taking
part
in
driving
the
saints
from
their
homes
in
jackson
county
before
him
boggs
made
affidavit
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
from
evidence
and
information
then
in
his
possession
that
joseph
smith
the
mormon
prophet
was
accessory
before
the
fact
of
the
intended
murder
and
therefore
applied
to
thomas
reynolds
governor
of
missouri
to
make
a
demand
on
the
governor
of
illinois
to
deliver
joseph
smith
up
to
some
person
authorized
to
receive
him
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
missouri
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
law
governor
reynolds
promptly
granted
the
request
and
made
the
demand
on
the
governor
of
illinois
for
the
surrender
of
joseph
to
one
ford
who
was
appointed
the
agent
of
missouri
to
receive
him
in
making
the
demand
governor
reynolds
said
whereas
it
appears
that
one
joseph
smith
is
a
fugitive
from
justice
charged
with
being
accessory
before
the
fact
to
an
assault
with
intent
to
kill
made
by
one
rockwell
on
lilburn
boggs
in
this
state
missouri
and
is
represented
to
the
executive
department
of
this
state
as
having
fled
to
the
state
of
illinois
now
therefore
i
do
by
these
presents
demand
the
surrender
and
delivering
of
the
said
joseph
smith
etc
we
have
given
this
extract
for
the
requisition
because
in
the
first
place
the
affidavit
of
boggs
upon
the
strength
of
which
governor
reynolds
made
his
demand
for
the
surrender
of
joseph
smith
does
not
claim
that
he
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
or
that
he
had
fled
from
the
state
of
missouri
to
illinois
but
on
the
contrary
the
affidavit
says
that
he
was
a
citizen
or
resident
of
illinois
hence
the
statement
of
fact
in
the
affidavit
was
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
demand
for
joseph
smith
to
be
surrendered
to
missouri
a
person
resident
in
a
state
may
not
be
delivered
up
to
the
authorities
of
another
state
for
alleged
offenses
unless
it
is
represented
that
he
has
fled
from
the
state
making
the
demand
for
his
surrender
to
escape
from
justice
this
charge
was
not
made
by
boggs
in
his
affidavit
which
was
governor
reynolds
only
authority
for
making
the
demand
but
in
what
boggs
failed
governor
reynolds
made
up
and
upon
his
own
responsibility
charged
in
his
demand
on
illinois
that
joseph
smith
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
had
fled
to
illinois
a
statement
that
was
at
once
untrue
and
wholly
gratuitous
on
the
part
of
the
executive
of
missouri
and
proves
him
to
be
a
willing
persecutor
of
the
innocent
secondly
it
was
this
assumption
on
the
part
of
reynolds
that
did
much
towards
making
the
demand
on
illinois
void
but
more
of
this
anon
governor
carlin
of
illinois
respected
the
demand
of
missouri
and
issued
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
rockwell
as
principal
and
joseph
smith
as
accessory
before
the
fact
in
an
assault
with
intent
to
kill
upon
boggs
the
papers
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
deputy
sheriff
of
adams
county
who
with
two
assistants
at
once
repaired
to
nauvoo
and
on
the
eighth
of
august
arrested
the
above
named
parties
there
was
no
evasion
of
the
officers
but
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
at
once
on
the
application
of
the
parties
arrested
issued
a
writ
of
requiring
the
officers
having
the
prisoners
in
charge
to
bring
them
before
that
tribunal
in
order
that
the
legality
of
the
warrant
under
which
they
were
arrested
might
be
tested
this
the
sheriff
refused
to
do
as
he
claimed
that
the
municipal
court
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case
but
he
left
the
prisoners
in
the
care
of
the
city
marshal
without
however
leaving
the
original
writ
upon
which
alone
they
could
be
held
and
the
deputy
sheriff
and
his
assistants
returned
to
quincy
the
prisoners
being
turned
loose
to
go
about
their
business
during
the
absence
of
the
deputy
sheriff
joseph
had
secured
a
writ
of
from
the
master
in
chancery
as
it
was
questionable
if
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
had
the
authority
to
issue
such
writs
in
cases
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
state
or
the
united
states
the
officers
returned
from
quincy
on
the
tenth
but
in
the
interim
it
had
been
decided
by
joseph
and
his
friends
that
the
best
thing
for
himself
and
rockwell
to
do
under
the
excitement
of
public
sentiment
then
existing
was
to
keep
out
of
the
way
for
a
season
so
that
the
officers
were
unable
to
find
them
on
their
return
joseph
crossed
the
river
and
stayed
at
his
uncle
john
house
for
a
few
days
in
the
settlement
called
zarahemla
but
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
august
he
met
by
appointment
his
brother
hyrum
rockwell
his
wife
emma
and
several
other
friends
at
the
south
point
of
the
island
that
stands
midway
in
the
river
between
nauvoo
and
montrose
it
had
been
rumored
that
the
governor
of
iowa
had
also
issued
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
joseph
and
rockwell
it
was
decided
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
remain
on
the
illinois
side
of
the
river
subsequent
events
however
proved
that
this
rumor
was
a
false
one
joseph
was
rowed
up
the
river
by
a
brother
dunham
to
a
point
near
the
home
of
a
brother
derby
rockwell
had
been
set
ashore
and
had
proceeded
to
the
same
point
on
foot
where
he
built
a
fire
on
the
bank
of
the
river
that
dunham
might
know
where
to
land
at
derby
the
prophet
remained
in
hiding
for
some
time
and
rockwell
went
east
remaining
for
several
months
in
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey
from
his
place
of
concealment
joseph
directed
the
movements
of
the
people
at
nauvoo
and
managed
his
own
business
through
faithful
agents
who
met
with
him
occasionally
emma
spent
considerable
of
her
time
with
him
and
beguiled
the
loneliness
of
those
weary
hours
of
inactivity
that
he
whose
life
is
the
synonym
for
activity
had
to
endure
during
those
days
of
exile
one
gets
a
glimpse
of
the
prophet
private
life
and
character
that
in
part
explains
the
mystery
of
his
power
and
influence
over
his
friends
and
his
people
it
was
his
unbounded
love
for
them
speaking
of
the
meeting
with
his
friends
in
the
night
at
the
island
in
the
account
he
gives
of
it
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
he
says
how
glorious
were
my
feelings
when
i
met
that
faithful
and
friendly
band
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
august
on
the
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
slough
between
zarahemla
and
nauvoo
with
what
unspeakable
delight
and
what
transports
of
joy
swelled
my
bosom
when
i
took
by
the
hand
on
that
night
my
beloved
emma
she
that
was
my
wife
even
the
wife
of
my
youth
and
choice
of
my
heart
many
were
the
vibrations
of
my
mind
when
i
contemplated
for
a
moment
the
many
scenes
we
had
been
called
to
pass
through
the
fatigues
and
the
toils
the
sorrows
and
sufferings
and
the
joys
and
the
consolations
from
time
to
time
which
had
strewed
our
paths
and
crowned
our
board
oh
what
a
commingling
of
thoughts
filled
my
mind
for
the
moment
and
again
she
is
here
even
in
the
seventh
trouble
undaunted
firm
and
unwavering
unchangeable
affectionate
emma
of
his
brother
hyrum
on
the
same
occasion
he
says
there
was
brother
hyrum
who
next
took
me
by
the
hand
a
natural
brother
thought
i
to
myself
brother
hyrum
what
a
faithful
heart
you
have
got
oh
may
the
eternal
jehovah
crown
eternal
blessings
upon
your
head
as
a
reward
for
the
care
you
have
had
for
my
soul
oh
how
many
are
the
sorrows
we
have
shared
together
and
again
we
find
ourselves
shackled
by
the
unrelenting
hand
of
oppression
hyrum
thy
name
shall
be
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
for
those
who
come
after
to
look
upon
that
they
may
pattern
after
thy
works
so
he
goes
on
to
call
the
faithful
by
their
names
and
record
their
deeds
of
love
manifested
towards
himself
and
pronounces
his
blessings
upon
them
and
if
as
one
of
old
said
we
know
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
because
we
love
the
brethren
surely
joseph
smith
possessed
that
witness
he
loved
his
brethren
better
than
his
life
some
of
the
brethren
proposed
that
joseph
should
go
up
to
the
pine
woods
of
wisconsin
where
a
number
of
the
brethren
were
engaged
in
getting
out
timber
for
the
temple
and
nauvoo
house
until
the
excitement
should
subside
in
illinois
of
this
proposition
joseph
said
in
a
letter
to
emma
my
mind
will
eternally
revolt
at
every
suggestion
of
that
kind
my
safety
is
with
you
if
you
want
to
have
it
so
if
i
go
to
the
pine
country
you
shall
go
along
with
me
and
the
children
and
if
you
and
the
children
go
not
with
me
i
do
go
i
do
not
wish
to
exile
myself
for
the
sake
of
my
own
life
i
would
rather
fight
it
out
it
is
for
your
sakes
therefore
that
i
would
do
such
a
thing
this
plan
however
was
abandoned
footnotes
it
was
then
supposed
that
boggs
was
dead
it
was
not
until
several
days
later
that
the
news
of
his
recovery
reached
nauvoo
or
quincy
i
say
questionable
as
representing
the
views
of
the
friends
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
my
judgment
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
municipal
court
having
no
such
power
and
if
the
letter
of
the
nauvoo
charter
justified
the
idea
that
the
municipal
court
possessed
any
such
power
to
interrupt
the
process
of
the
state
and
united
states
courts
it
was
a
manifest
defect
in
the
wording
of
the
charter
a
solecism
that
would
render
that
part
of
the
charter
void
some
years
before
this
in
december
joseph
said
of
hyrum
i
could
pray
in
my
heart
that
all
men
were
like
my
brother
hyrum
who
possesses
the
mildness
of
a
lamb
and
the
integrity
of
a
job
and
in
short
the
meekness
and
humility
of
christ
and
i
love
him
with
that
love
that
is
stronger
than
death
for
i
never
had
occasion
to
rebuke
him
nor
he
mill
star
vol
vx
chapter
xxiv
the
prophet
trial
at
springfield
missouri
again
thwarted
it
appears
that
joseph
had
resolved
to
submit
no
longer
to
the
injustice
he
had
suffered
from
the
hands
of
the
people
of
missouri
it
was
rumored
that
the
officers
on
leaving
nauvoo
breathed
out
threats
of
returning
with
sufficient
force
to
search
every
house
in
the
city
and
vicinity
and
sheriff
ford
the
agent
of
missouri
threatened
to
bring
a
mob
against
the
mormons
if
necessary
to
arrest
the
prophet
hearing
these
rumors
joseph
exchanged
several
letters
with
william
law
who
had
been
recently
elected
of
the
legion
john
bennett
cashiered
in
which
he
admonished
him
to
have
all
things
in
readiness
to
protect
the
people
in
their
rights
and
not
for
one
moment
to
submit
to
the
outrages
that
were
threatened
you
will
see
therefore
said
he
in
a
letter
written
on
the
fourteenth
of
august
to
law
that
the
peace
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
is
kept
let
who
will
endeavor
to
disturb
it
you
will
also
see
that
whenever
any
mob
force
or
violence
is
used
on
any
citizen
thereof
or
that
belongeth
thereunto
you
will
see
that
force
or
violence
is
immediately
dispersed
and
brought
to
punishment
or
meet
it
and
contest
it
at
the
point
of
the
sword
with
firm
undaunted
and
unyielding
valor
and
let
them
know
that
the
spirit
of
old
and
of
george
washington
yet
lives
and
is
contained
in
the
bosoms
and
blood
of
the
children
of
the
fathers
thereof
if
there
are
any
threats
in
the
city
let
legal
steps
be
taken
against
them
and
let
no
man
woman
or
child
be
intimidated
nor
suffer
it
to
be
done
nevertheless
as
i
said
in
the
first
place
we
will
take
every
measure
that
lays
in
our
power
and
make
every
sacrifice
that
god
or
man
could
require
at
our
hands
to
preserve
the
peace
and
safety
of
the
people
without
collision
to
these
sentiments
there
was
a
willing
response
of
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
the
and
he
pledged
himself
to
faithfully
carry
out
joseph
orders
provided
the
emergency
for
doing
so
should
arise
after
a
little
however
the
excitement
began
to
subside
and
as
joseph
hiding
place
at
derby
was
discovered
by
a
young
man
who
suddenly
came
upon
him
and
his
kind
host
while
they
were
walking
out
in
the
woods
for
exercise
the
prophet
moved
quietly
into
the
city
staying
first
at
the
house
of
one
friend
a
day
or
two
and
then
removing
to
that
of
another
in
the
meantime
the
case
was
plainly
placed
before
governor
carlin
and
the
course
that
joseph
had
taken
fully
vindicated
by
letters
written
to
him
by
emma
his
wife
who
displayed
no
mean
ability
in
the
correspondence
she
opened
up
with
the
governor
which
so
nearly
concerned
the
peace
of
her
family
she
directed
the
attention
of
the
governor
to
the
fact
that
joseph
had
not
been
in
the
state
of
missouri
for
some
three
or
four
years
that
if
her
husband
had
been
accessory
before
the
fact
to
the
assault
upon
boggs
the
crime
if
committed
at
all
which
she
stoutly
averred
was
not
the
case
was
done
in
illinois
and
there
was
no
law
to
drag
a
man
from
a
state
where
the
crime
was
committed
into
a
state
where
it
had
not
been
committed
for
trial
and
as
her
husband
had
not
been
in
the
state
of
missouri
for
several
years
previous
to
the
assault
on
boggs
he
could
not
have
fled
from
the
justice
of
that
state
and
therefore
ought
not
to
be
given
up
under
the
law
letters
from
many
prominent
citizens
of
nauvoo
were
also
sent
to
the
governor
and
the
female
relief
society
called
his
attention
to
the
threat
of
mob
violence
and
invasion
from
missouri
and
asked
that
sufficient
military
protection
might
be
given
to
insure
the
peace
and
safety
of
nauvoo
all
these
things
the
governor
treated
lightly
and
claimed
that
the
only
excitement
that
existed
was
with
the
mormon
people
at
nauvoo
and
nowhere
else
and
there
was
no
need
he
insisted
of
taking
the
precautions
hinted
at
by
the
people
though
when
talking
on
another
subject
he
unwittingly
remarked
that
persons
were
offering
their
services
every
day
either
in
person
or
by
letter
and
held
themselves
in
readiness
to
go
against
the
saints
whenever
he
should
call
upon
them
but
he
never
had
the
least
idea
of
calling
on
the
militia
neither
had
he
thought
it
necessary
he
maintained
that
the
proper
thing
for
joseph
to
do
was
to
give
himself
up
to
the
authorities
of
missouri
for
trial
and
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
acquitted
judge
ralston
asked
him
how
he
thought
smith
would
go
through
the
midst
of
his
enemies
without
being
subject
to
violence
and
how
after
his
acquittal
he
would
be
able
to
return
to
illinois
to
that
proposition
the
governor
could
give
no
satisfactory
answer
but
made
light
of
the
whole
matter
and
in
spite
of
all
the
protests
sent
in
by
the
people
of
nauvoo
he
made
a
proclamation
that
as
joseph
smith
and
rockwell
had
resisted
the
laws
by
refusing
to
go
with
the
officers
who
had
them
in
custody
and
had
made
their
escape
he
offered
a
reward
of
two
hundred
dollars
for
each
or
either
of
those
fugitives
from
justice
governor
reynolds
also
offered
a
reward
for
their
arrest
three
hundred
dollars
for
each
one
or
either
of
them
joseph
continued
to
remain
in
the
city
and
moved
about
cautiously
attending
to
his
business
a
tide
of
popular
prejudice
had
set
in
of
such
proportions
that
it
seemed
that
it
would
overwhelm
the
saints
it
had
been
created
largely
through
the
misrepresentations
of
john
bennett
and
joseph
at
once
determined
to
counteract
it
if
possible
he
ordered
that
a
special
conference
be
called
to
meet
on
the
of
august
to
appoint
elders
of
the
church
to
go
through
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
east
to
flood
the
country
with
the
truth
in
relation
to
bennett
character
the
conference
was
called
and
in
the
interim
documents
and
affidavits
were
prepared
that
the
brethren
might
be
armed
with
proofs
in
relation
to
the
facts
respecting
bennett
and
his
misrepresentations
the
conference
convened
on
the
day
appointed
and
hyrum
smith
addressed
them
on
the
mission
that
many
of
them
were
expected
to
take
at
the
conclusion
of
his
remarks
joseph
suddenly
stepped
into
the
stand
to
the
great
joy
of
his
people
many
of
whom
thought
he
had
gone
to
washington
and
others
to
europe
his
appearance
created
great
cheerfulness
and
animation
among
the
people
joseph
naturally
impulsive
was
overjoyed
to
again
stand
before
the
saints
he
addressed
them
in
more
than
his
usual
spirited
manner
and
called
upon
the
brethren
to
go
through
the
states
taking
documents
with
them
to
show
to
the
world
the
corrupt
and
oppressive
conduct
of
boggs
carlin
and
others
that
the
public
might
have
the
truth
laid
before
them
in
response
to
this
call
to
sustain
the
prophet
character
three
hundred
and
eighty
elders
volunteered
their
services
and
announced
their
willingness
to
go
immediately
for
several
days
after
the
conference
the
prophet
continued
about
home
but
it
being
revealed
to
him
that
his
enemies
were
again
on
the
move
to
take
him
he
found
it
necessary
to
drop
out
of
sight
it
was
during
this
time
of
hiding
that
he
wrote
those
instructions
respecting
baptism
for
the
dead
contained
in
the
and
sections
of
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
but
notwithstanding
his
enemies
were
on
the
watch
for
him
he
now
and
then
visited
his
home
and
on
the
occasion
of
paying
one
of
these
visits
to
his
family
he
nearly
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
officers
he
was
at
dinner
with
his
family
at
the
mansion
when
deputy
sheriff
pitman
of
adams
county
and
an
assistant
suddenly
presented
themselves
at
the
door
fortunately
john
boynton
who
was
present
saw
them
first
and
went
to
the
door
to
meet
them
they
asked
him
if
joseph
smith
was
present
to
which
he
gave
an
evasive
answer
saying
that
he
had
seen
joseph
that
morning
but
did
not
say
he
had
seen
him
since
during
this
conversation
the
prophet
stepped
out
of
the
back
door
ran
through
the
corn
in
his
garden
and
so
to
the
house
of
bishop
whitney
emma
now
engaged
the
sheriff
in
conversation
he
said
he
wanted
to
search
the
house
she
asked
if
he
had
a
search
warrant
to
which
he
answered
in
the
negative
but
insisted
on
searching
the
house
nevertheless
and
as
she
knew
that
joseph
had
escaped
she
did
not
refuse
of
course
the
search
was
fruitless
it
was
reported
that
a
party
of
fifteen
left
quincy
with
the
sheriff
the
day
before
and
that
they
rode
all
night
expecting
to
reach
nauvoo
before
daylight
surround
the
mansion
and
capture
joseph
but
in
the
night
they
got
scattered
and
did
not
meet
again
nor
did
sheriff
pitman
reach
nauvoo
until
about
noon
when
he
made
the
effort
above
detailed
about
the
first
of
october
elder
rigdon
and
elias
higbee
were
in
carthage
and
from
a
conversation
with
judge
douglass
they
learned
that
governor
carlin
had
purposely
issued
an
illegal
writ
for
the
arrest
of
joseph
thinking
he
would
go
to
carthage
to
be
acquitted
on
proceedings
before
judge
douglass
when
an
officer
of
the
state
would
be
present
with
a
legal
writ
and
serve
it
upon
him
immediately
and
thus
drag
him
to
missouri
the
plot
however
was
discovered
in
time
to
thwart
it
and
joseph
in
company
with
elder
john
taylor
wilson
law
and
john
parker
left
nauvoo
for
the
home
of
elder
taylor
father
about
a
day
and
a
half
ride
from
nauvoo
and
there
the
prophet
remained
for
about
a
week
meantime
through
major
warren
master
in
chancery
joseph
case
was
presented
to
justice
butterfield
of
chicago
and
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
illinois
he
wrote
out
an
elaborate
review
of
the
case
in
which
he
claimed
that
joseph
could
be
released
on
a
writ
of
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
prove
that
he
was
not
in
missouri
at
the
time
the
alleged
crime
was
committed
that
of
necessity
if
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
he
must
have
committed
it
in
illinois
and
therefore
was
not
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
the
governor
of
illinois
had
no
right
to
surrender
him
to
the
authorities
of
missouri
as
such
butterfield
contended
that
a
warrant
for
the
action
of
the
governor
of
a
state
in
delivering
up
a
person
to
the
authorities
of
another
state
was
found
in
that
clause
of
the
constitution
which
says
a
person
charged
in
any
state
with
treason
felony
or
other
crime
who
shall
flee
from
justice
and
be
found
in
another
state
shall
on
demand
of
the
executive
authority
of
the
state
from
which
he
fled
be
delivered
up
to
be
removed
to
the
state
having
jurisdiction
of
the
crime
constitution
article
section
butterfield
insisted
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
inquire
into
the
laws
that
had
been
enacted
by
congress
on
the
subject
since
congress
has
just
so
much
power
and
no
more
than
is
expressly
given
by
the
said
clause
in
the
constitution
what
persons
then
he
inquires
can
be
surrendered
up
by
the
governor
of
one
state
to
the
governor
of
another
first
he
must
be
a
person
charged
with
treason
felony
or
other
crime
it
is
sufficient
if
he
be
charged
with
the
commission
of
crime
either
by
indictment
found
or
by
affidavit
second
he
must
be
a
person
who
shall
flee
from
justice
and
be
found
in
another
state
it
is
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
this
branch
of
the
constitution
that
he
should
be
charged
with
having
fled
from
justice
unless
he
has
actually
fled
from
the
state
where
the
offense
was
committed
into
another
state
the
governor
of
this
state
has
no
jurisdiction
over
his
person
and
can
not
deliver
him
up
butterfield
reviewed
the
subject
of
writs
and
their
operations
both
in
england
and
the
united
states
and
quoted
a
number
of
cases
from
the
courts
of
new
york
and
the
action
of
the
executives
of
the
several
states
to
support
the
principles
he
contended
for
and
concluded
his
communication
in
these
words
i
would
advise
that
smith
procure
respectable
and
sufficient
affidavits
to
prove
beyond
all
question
that
he
was
in
this
state
illinois
and
not
in
missouri
at
the
time
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
was
committed
and
upon
these
affidavits
apply
to
the
governor
to
countermand
the
warrant
he
has
issued
for
his
arrest
if
he
should
refuse
so
to
do
i
am
already
of
the
opinion
that
upon
that
state
of
facts
the
supreme
court
will
discharge
him
upon
joseph
acted
upon
this
advice
and
sent
agents
with
all
the
necessary
papers
to
springfield
and
applied
to
governor
ford
carlin
term
of
office
in
the
meantime
having
expired
to
revoke
the
writ
and
proclamation
of
carlin
for
his
arrest
the
supreme
court
being
in
session
governor
ford
submitted
the
petition
and
all
the
papers
pertaining
thereto
for
their
opinion
and
they
were
unanimous
in
their
belief
that
the
missouri
writ
was
illegal
but
were
divided
as
to
whether
it
would
be
proper
for
the
present
executive
to
interfere
with
the
official
acts
of
his
predecessor
and
therefore
governor
ford
refused
to
interfere
but
said
in
a
personal
letter
addressed
to
the
prophet
i
can
only
advise
that
you
submit
to
the
laws
and
have
a
judicial
investigation
of
your
rights
if
it
should
become
necessary
for
this
purpose
to
repair
to
springfield
i
do
not
believe
that
there
will
be
any
disposition
to
use
illegal
violence
towards
you
and
i
would
feel
it
my
duty
in
your
case
as
in
the
case
of
any
other
person
to
protect
you
with
any
necessary
amount
of
force
from
mob
violence
whilst
asserting
your
rights
before
the
courts
going
to
and
returning
this
reply
was
endorsed
by
butterfield
and
james
adams
in
whom
joseph
had
great
confidence
and
in
conformity
with
the
advice
joseph
was
arrested
by
wilson
law
on
carlin
proclamation
application
was
made
at
carthage
for
a
writ
of
to
go
before
the
court
at
springfield
no
writ
could
be
obtained
at
the
court
in
carthage
as
the
clerk
had
been
elected
to
the
state
senate
but
an
order
for
such
writ
was
issued
on
the
master
in
chancery
and
with
that
document
joseph
in
the
company
of
his
brother
hyrum
john
taylor
and
others
and
in
charge
of
wilson
law
started
for
springfield
where
they
arrived
in
the
afternoon
of
the
thirtieth
of
december
judge
pope
had
continued
his
court
two
or
three
days
in
order
to
give
joseph
case
a
hearing
and
in
the
first
interview
the
judge
had
with
him
agreed
to
try
the
case
on
its
merits
and
not
dismiss
it
on
any
technicality
the
deputy
sheriff
of
adams
county
was
present
but
refused
at
first
to
say
whether
he
had
the
original
writ
or
not
but
finally
king
his
associate
admitted
he
had
it
fearing
that
it
was
the
object
of
these
men
to
hold
the
original
writ
until
after
proceedings
had
concluded
on
the
arrest
made
by
virtue
of
governor
carlin
proclamation
and
thus
create
more
trouble
a
petition
was
made
to
governor
ford
to
issue
a
new
writ
that
the
case
might
come
up
on
its
merits
which
was
granted
and
joseph
was
arrested
by
maxey
and
a
writ
of
was
issued
by
the
court
but
as
several
days
must
elapse
before
a
hearing
could
be
had
joseph
was
placed
under
bonds
wilson
law
and
general
james
adams
being
his
bondsmen
at
last
the
day
of
trial
came
on
and
the
of
the
state
made
the
following
objection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
the
arrest
and
detention
of
smith
was
not
under
or
by
color
of
authority
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
officer
of
the
united
states
but
under
and
by
color
of
authority
of
the
state
of
illinois
by
the
officer
of
the
state
of
illinois
when
a
fugitive
from
justice
is
arrested
by
authority
of
the
governor
of
any
state
upon
the
requisition
of
the
governor
of
another
state
the
courts
of
justice
neither
state
nor
federal
have
any
authority
or
jurisdiction
to
inquire
into
facts
behind
the
writ
these
points
were
ably
argued
and
by
butterfield
for
the
defense
and
the
for
the
state
after
giving
a
patient
hearing
the
court
gave
its
opinion
saying
in
relation
to
the
first
objection
that
the
warrant
on
its
face
purports
to
be
issued
in
pursuance
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
therefore
the
court
had
jurisdiction
the
matter
in
hand
said
judge
pope
presents
a
case
arising
under
the
second
section
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
an
act
of
congress
of
february
to
carry
it
into
effect
the
constitution
says
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
all
cases
in
law
or
equity
arising
under
this
constitution
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
treaties
made
and
which
shall
be
made
under
their
authority
therefore
on
that
line
of
reasoning
the
judge
concluded
the
court
had
jurisdiction
as
to
the
second
objection
the
right
of
the
court
to
inquire
into
facts
behind
the
writ
the
judge
held
it
unnecessary
to
decide
that
point
as
smith
was
entitled
to
his
discharge
for
defect
in
the
affidavit
on
which
the
demand
for
his
surrender
to
missouri
was
made
to
justify
the
demand
for
his
arrest
the
affidavit
should
have
shown
first
that
smith
committed
a
crime
second
that
he
committed
it
in
missouri
and
it
must
also
appear
smith
had
fled
from
missouri
none
of
these
things
the
affidavit
of
boggs
did
and
the
judge
held
that
it
was
defective
for
those
reasons
and
added
the
court
can
alone
regard
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
boggs
as
having
any
legal
existence
the
and
in
the
requisition
and
warrant
are
not
supported
by
oath
and
can
not
be
received
as
evidence
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
his
liberty
and
transport
him
to
a
foreign
state
for
trial
for
these
reasons
smith
must
be
discharged
and
joseph
had
scored
another
victory
over
his
old
enemies
in
missouri
chapter

incidents
of
the
trial
and
acquittal
during
the
trial
excitement
at
times
ran
high
and
threatened
to
break
out
into
acts

violence
when
joseph
first
made
his
way
through
the
throng
about
the
some
one
in
the
crowd
recognized
him
and
exclaimed

prepared
for

disturbance

the
excitement

quieted
down
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
the
prophet
had
good
opportunity
of
associating
with
some
of
the
leading
men
of
the
state
among
them
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
governor
ford
who
ventured
to
caution
the
prophet
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
electioneering
in
political
contests
a
thing
the
prophet
said
in
reply
he
had
never
done
governor
ford
also
told
him
that
he
had
a
requisition
from
the
governor
of
missouri
for
the
arrest
of
himself
and
others
on
the
old
charge
of
treason
arson
but
he
happened
to
know
that
the
charges
were
dead
the
state
legislature
was
also
in
session
and
consequently
there
was
a
general
gathering
of
the
principal
men
of
illinois
and
the
prophet
extended
largely
his
circle
of
acquaintances
among
them
the
time
occupied
by
the
trial
kept
joseph
and
his
party
over
one
sunday
in
springfield
and
the
use
of
the
hall
of
representatives
was
tendered
him
in
which
to
hold
religious
services
the
use
of
the
hall
was
accepted
and
orson
hyde
preached
in
the
forenoon
and
elder
john
taylor
in
the
afternoon
the
services
being
largely
attended
by
members
of
the
legislature
it
required
several
days
to
make
the
journey
from
springfield
to
nauvoo
and
the
prophet
party
suffered
no
little
from
the
extreme
coldness
of
the
weather
the
news
of
joseph
triumph
had
preceded
him
and
as
his
party
approached
the
city
of
which
he
was
the
chief
founder
the
people
turned
out
almost
to
bid
him
welcome
to
his
home
and
though
there
was
little
or
none
of
the
pomp
and
circumstance
and
splendor
that
attend
the
welcome
of
a
king
by
his
subjects
yet
never
did
king
receive
more
hearty
or
sincere
welcome
from
his
people
than
did
joseph
from
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
the
day
following
his
return
home
the
prophet
issued
invitations
to
the
twelve
apostles
and
their
wives
and
other
leading
citizens
to
attend
a
feast
at
his
house
in
honor
of
his
release
from
his
enemies
the
twelve
at
the
same
time
issued
a
proclamation
inviting
the
saints
in
nauvoo
to
unite
with
them
in
dedicating
tuesday
the
seventeenth
of
january
as
a
day
of
humiliation
fasting
praise
prayer
and
thanksgiving
before
the
great
eloheim
because
of
the
deliverance
he
had
wrought
out
for
his
servant
the
bishops
were
instructed
to
provide
suitable
places
in
their
respective
wards
for
the
people
to
meet
in
and
one
or
more
of
the
brethren
who
had
been
with
joseph
at
springfield
would
be
present
to
relate
what
had
happened
although
to
relate
here
the
circumstances
that
befell
the
man
who
was
accused
as
the
chief
actor
in
the
assault
upon
boggs
rockwell
takes
us
beyond
many
events
of
which
we
desire
to
speak
we
think
it
proper
to
record
how
after
spending
several
months
in
the
eastern
states
he
returned
to
louis
where
he
was
recognized
by
elias
parker
who
made
affidavit
that
he
was
the
rockwell
advertised
for
in
the
papers
and
on
the
fourth
of
march
was
arrested
by
fox
and
taken
to
independence
for
trial
rockwell
wrote
from
his
prison
in
independence
to
bishop
whitney
for
bail
which
was
fixed
at
five
thousand
dollars
but
as
the
court
in
missouri
would
only
take
some
responsible
person
resident
in
missouri
bail
could
not
be
secured
for
him
i
have
not
the
space
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
all
adventures
and
sufferings
during
his
weary
imprisonment
of
nearly
eight
months
he
suffered
much
cruelty
in
prison
life
and
when
his
case
came
before
the
grand
jury
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
an
indictment
against
him
but
in
the
meantime
he
had
made
an
effort
to
escape
and
was
held
on
a
charge
of
for
which
when
he
came
to
be
tried
he
was
sentenced
to
five
minutes
imprisonment
though
they
kept
him
for
several
hours
while
an
effort
was
made
to
trump
up
new
charges
against
him
one
incident
occurred
during
rockwell
imprisonment
that
we
can
not
pass
without
notice
sheriff
reynolds
made
an
effort
to
induce
him
to
go
to
nauvoo
and
as
the
prophet
joseph
had
great
confidence
in
him
reynolds
proposition
was
that
he
should
drive
joseph
in
a
carriage
outside
of
nauvoo
where
the
missourians
could
capture
him
and
then
as
to
himself
he
could
either
remain
in
illinois
return
to
missouri
or
go
where
he
pleased
you
only
deliver
joe
smith
into
our
hands
said
reynolds
and
name
your
pile
i
will
see
you
all
damned
first
and
then
i
wo
replied
rockwell
after
meeting
with
many
adventures
he
arrived
in
nauvoo
on
an
evening
when
there
was
a
social
party
in
progress
at
the
prophet
house
in
the
midst
of
the
festivities
joseph
observed
a
man
with
long
hair
falling
down
over
his
shoulders
staggering
among
his
guests
as
if
intoxicated
and
the
suspicion
arose
at
once
that
he
was
a
missourian
joseph
quietly
spoke
to
the
captain
of
police
who
was
present
and
told
him
to
put
the
stranger
out
a
struggle
ensued
and
during
its
progress
the
prophet
had
a
full
view
of
the
man
face
and
at
once
recognized
his
devoted
friend
rockwell
it
is
needless
to
say
he
was
given
a
hearty
welcome
or
that
the
story
of
his
adventures
among
the
missourians
contributed
no
little
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
evening
though
some
portions
of
his
narrative
were
so
burdened
with
accounts
of
his
sufferings
and
the
cruelties
practiced
towards
him
that
they
were
calculated
to
produce
sorrow
rather
than
joy
but
these
feelings
were
banished
by
the
fact
that
he
was
now
delivered
out
of
them
all
and
honorably
discharged
in
fulfillment
of
the
prophecy
uttered
by
joseph
shortly
after
he
heard
of
rockwell
arrest
in
louis
nearly
a
year
before
the
party
which
had
been
so
rudely
yet
so
pleasantly
interrupted
proceeded
no
one
enjoying
it
more
than
the
stranger
a
few
days
only
after
the
departure
from
springfield
of
the
prophet
and
his
party
john
bennett
arrived
there
the
measures
he
then
set
on
foot
and
which
produced
ultimately
what
very
nearly
became
serious
results
may
be
judged
from
the
following
letter
addressed
to
sidney
rigdon
and
orson
pratt
under
date
of
january
dear
friends
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
written
to
you
and
i
should
now
much
desire
to
see
you
but
i
leave
tonight
for
missouri
to
meet
the
messenger
charged
with
the
arrest
of
joseph
smith
hyrum
smith
lyman
wight
and
others
for
murder
burglary
treason
and
who
will
be
demanded
in
a
few
days
on
new
indictments
found
by
a
grand
jury
of
a
called
court
on
the
original
evidence
and
in
relation
to
which
a
was
entered
by
the
district
attorney
new
proceedings
have
been
gotten
up
on
the
old
charges
and
no
can
then
save
them
we
shall
try
smith
on
the
boggs
case
when
we
get
him
into
missouri
the
war
goes
bravely
on
and
although
smith
thinks
he
is
now
safe
the
enemy
is
near
even
at
the
door
he
has
awoke
the
wrong
passenger
the
governor
will
relinquish
joe
up
at
once
on
the
new
requisition
there
is
but
one
opinion
on
the
case
and
that
is
nothing
can
save
joe
on
the
new
requisition
and
demand
predicated
on
the
old
charges
on
the
institution
of
new
writs
he
must
go
to
missouri
but
he
will
not
be
harmed
if
he
is
not
guilty
but
he
is
a
murderer
and
must
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
law
enough
on
this
subject
i
hope
that
both
of
your
amiable
families
are
well
and
you
will
please
to
give
to
them
all
my
best
respects
i
hope
to
see
you
soon
when
the
officer
arrives
i
shall
be
near
at
hand
i
shall
see
you
all
again
please
write
me
at
independence
immediately
this
letter
was
handed
by
orson
pratt
to
joseph
and
was
read
by
him
to
sidney
rigdon
and
the
company
which
gathered
at
the
nauvoo
mansion
to
celebrate
the
prophet
release
by
a
feast
to
the
discomfiture
of
sidney
rigdon
who
of
course
was
averse
to
having
it
known
that
he
held
any
correspondence
with
bennett
the
action
of
orson
pratt
in
this
matter
paved
the
way
for
his
return
to
his
position
in
the
church
for
he
had
been
suspended
from
his
quorum
in
the
priesthood
having
been
led
to
oppose
the
counsels
and
falsely
accuse
the
prophet
in
consequence
of
the
misrepresentations
and
malicious
schemes
of
john
bennett
but
after
the
above
incident
he
was
by
the
prophet
and
received
back
into
the
quorum
of
the
apostles
in
full
confidence
and
fellowship
meantime
nauvoo
was
growing
at
this
period
the
winter
of
her
inhabitants
are
variously
computed
from
twelve
to
sixteen
thousand
her
public
buildings
chiefly
the
temple
and
the
nauvoo
house
were
progressing
rapidly
more
pretentious
buildings
were
being
erected
and
new
additions
to
the
original
town
plat
were
made
and
the
city
early
in
december
had
been
divided
ecclesiastically
into
ten
wards
and
bishops
were
appointed
by
the
high
council
to
preside
over
each
the
city
council
was
active
in
passing
ordinances
to
meet
the
growing
necessities
of
a
rapidly
increasing
population
looking
especially
to
the
cleanliness
health
and
morality
of
the
city
in
february
joseph
was
elected
a
second
time
to
be
mayor
and
all
things
considered
nauvoo
was
rapidly
approaching
the
high
water
mark
of
her
prosperity
chapter
xxvi
doctrinal
development
at
nauvoo
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
after
the
effort
of
the
prophet
enemies
to
drag
him
into
missouri
on
the
charge
of
being
an
accessory
before
the
fact
in
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
boggs
nauvoo
was
granted
a
blessed
season
of
peace
lasting
from
january
to
the
month
of
june
following
it
is
well
to
note
the
circumstance
for
nauvoo
had
few
such
periods
peace
is
essential
to
the
growth
of
cities
commerce
flees
from
strife
and
trade
sinks
into
decay
where
conflicts
distract
the
people
nauvoo
was
favorably
located
and
no
city
in
the
gave
better
promise
of
becoming
an
important
center
of
domestic
commerce
manufactures
and
inland
and
river
trade
with
peace
it
could
easily
have
become
the
rival
of
louis
or
chicago
and
kansas
city
and
omaha
as
outfitting
points
for
the
great
west
might
scarcely
have
been
known
in
addition
to
being
a
center
of
trade
manufactures
and
domestic
commerce
the
presence
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
would
have
made
it
a
shrine
a
gathering
place
for
the
faithful
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
an
educational
center
also
for
already
the
charters
were
secured
and
the
faculty
chosen
for
a
great
university
and
the
keen
interest
which
the
prophet
and
his
followers
had
ever
manifested
in
education
gave
every
promise
that
nauvoo
in
time
would
be
one
of
the
prominent
centers
of
higher
education
in
the
united
states
the
peace
essential
to
this
material
and
educational
growth
however
was
not
granted
to
nauvoo
sectarian
bitterness
against
the
religion
of
the
prophet
and
his
followers
was
too
political
jealousy
was
too
strong
and
hence
strife
plots
threats
of
violence
actual
violence
rumors
of
invasions
from
missouri
hints
of
assistance
from
mobs
in
illinois
the
frequent
arrest
of
the
founder
of
the
city
the
false
reports
that
went
abroad
concerning
its
inhabitants
all
combined
to
blight
the
growth
which
otherwise
might
have
been
hoped
for
from
nauvoo
favorable
position
and
early
development
but
this
lull
referred
to
in
that
all
but
incessant
storm
which
beat
upon
the
uncovered
head
of
joseph
smith
from
the
time
he
announced
to
the
world
a
revelation
from
god
until
this
period
of
grace
from
january
to
the
june
following
was
employed
by
him
to
good
advantage
in
the
matter
of
the
doctrinal
development
of
the
church
it
was
in
this
period
that
he
unfolded
the
doctrines
which
most
distinguish
the
church
which
under
god
he
had
founded
from
the
sectarian
churches
founded
by
men
unfortunately
we
do
not
have
reports
of
his
discourses
during
this
period
most
of
them
were
reported
in
by
willard
richards
his
confidential
friend
and
secretary
and
wilford
woodruff
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
and
noted
among
other
things
for
daily
journalizing
events
passing
under
his
observation
but
these
reports
are
not
and
there
doubtless
exist
many
verbal
inaccuracies
and
often
the
impression
of
the
idea
left
upon
the
mind
of
the
reporter
rather
than
the
idea
itself
but
notwithstanding
some
verbal
inaccuracies
that
may
exist
and
even
the
statement
of
the
impression
of
ideas
for
the
ideas
themselves
still
these
reports
of
the
discourses
of
the
prophet
stand
among
the
most
valued
documents
of
our
annals
without
strict
regard
to
the
chronological
order
in
which
occur
his
discourses
conversations
letters
and
revelations
quoted
in
the
following
pages
of
the
chapters
devoted
to
doctrinal
subjects
i
wish
to
present
the
substance
of
his
teachings
within
the
period
named
the
functions
of
the
priesthood
to
bless
to
orson
hyde
one
of
the
twelve
somewhat
given
to
prophesying
calamities
and
speaking
with
severity
to
those
slow
to
receive
his
words
the
prophet
took
occasion
to
say
in
a
council
meeting
of
the
twelve
i
told
elder
hyde
that
when
he
spoke
in
the
name
of
the
lord
it
should
prove
true
but
he
must
not
curse
the
people
rather
bless
them
a
remark
which
at
once
recognizes
the
power
of
that
priesthood
held
by
orson
hyde
even
though
he
curse
the
people
but
he
more
especially
points
out
the
fact
that
the
chief
function
of
that
priesthood
is
to
bless
and
not
curse
the
scriptures
and
their
interpretation
occasionally
the
prophet
expounded
the
scriptures
and
in
this
he
was
most
happy
not
so
much
on
account
of
his
knowledge
of
ancient
languages
though
that
knowledge
when
his
opportunities
for
acquiring
it
are
taken
into
account
was
surprisingly
extensive
as
from
that
divine
inspiration
which
so
mightily
rested
upon
him
at
times
of
the
bible
itself
the
prophet
said
i
believe
the
bible
as
it
read
when
it
came
from
the
pen
of
the
original
writers
ignorant
translators
careless
transcribers
or
designing
and
corrupt
priests
have
committed
many
errors
as
an
example
of
the
errors
which
had
crept
into
the
holy
record
he
put
in
contrast
the
following
it
repented
the
lord
that
he
had
made
man
on
the
genesis
v
god
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
lie
neither
the
son
of
man
that
he
should
numbers
xxiii
his
exegesis
which
at
once
harmonizes
the
conflicting
passages
and
satisfies
the
understanding
is
as
follows
it
ought
to
read
it
repented
that
god
had
made
man
this
i
believe
and
then
the
other
quotation
meaning
the
second
stands
fair
if
any
man
will
prove
to
me
by
one
passage
of
holy
writ
one
item
i
believe
to
be
false
i
will
renounce
and
disclaim
it
as
far
as
i
have
promulgated
it
in
like
manner
he
set
the
following
passage
right
hebrews
vi
the
first
principles
of
the
gospel
as
i
believe
are
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
with
the
promise
of
the
look
at
hebrews
vi
for
contradictions
therefore
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
christ
let
us
go
on
unto
perfection
if
a
man
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
christ
how
can
he
be
saved
in
the
principles
this
is
a
contradiction
i
will
render
it
as
it
should
be
therefore
leaving
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
christ
let
us
go
on
unto
perfection
not
laying
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead
works
and
of
faith
towards
god
etc
in
like
manner
he
pointed
out
a
solecism
in
the
lord
prayer
it
reads
in
our
common
version
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
the
power
etc
in
contrast
with
this
may
be
placed
the
statement
of
james
let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted
i
am
tempted
of
god
for
god
can
not
be
tempted
with
evil
tempteth
he
any
james
then
why
pray
to
god
the
father
and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
the
prophet
exegesis
was
the
passage
should
read
and
us
not
or
suffer
us
not
to
be
led
into
temptation
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
etc
again
in
a
public
discourse
he
dealt
with
the
following
passage
among
those
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
arisen
a
greater
prophet
than
john
the
baptist
nevertheless
he
that
is
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
he
taking
up
the
first
part
of
the
question
viz
the
greatness
of
john
he
thus
expounded
it
firstly
he
john
was
trusted
with
a
divine
mission
of
preparing
the
way
before
the
face
of
the
lord
whoever
had
such
a
trust
committed
to
him
before
or
since
no
man
secondly
he
was
intrusted
with
the
important
mission
and
it
was
required
at
his
hands
to
baptize
the
son
of
man
whoever
had
the
honor
of
doing
that
whoever
had
so
great
a
privilege
and
glory
whoever
led
the
son
of
god
into
the
waters
of
baptism
and
had
the
privilege
of
beholding
the
holy
ghost
descend
in
the
form
of
a
dove
or
rather
in
the
sign
of
a
dove
in
witness
of
that
administration
thirdly
john
at
that
time
was
the
only
legal
administrator
in
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
there
was
then
on
earth
and
holding
the
keys
of
power
the
jews
had
to
obey
his
instructions
or
be
damned
by
their
own
laws
and
christ
himself
fulfilled
all
righteousness
in
becoming
obedient
to
the
law
which
he
had
given
to
moses
on
the
mount
and
thereby
magnified
it
and
made
it
honorable
instead
of
destroying
it
the
son
of
zachariah
wrested
the
keys
the
kingdom
the
power
the
glory
from
the
jews
by
the
holy
anointing
and
decree
of
heaven
and
these
three
reasons
constitute
him
the
greatest
prophet
born
of
women
taking
up
the
second
part
of
the
subject
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
he
greater
than
john
it
was
made
easy
to
understand
in
the
following
manner
how
was
the
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
greater
than
he
john
in
reply
i
ask
who
did
jesus
have
reference
to
as
being
the
least
jesus
was
looked
upon
as
having
the
claim
in
all
kingdom
and
was
entitled
to
their
credulity
as
a
prophet
as
though
he
had
said
he
that
is
the
least
among
you
is
greater
than
john
that
is
myself
explaining
the
matter
of
interpretation
itself
he
said
what
is
the
rule
of
interpretation
just
no
interpretation
at
all
understand
it
precisely
as
it
reads
i
have
a
key
by
which
i
understand
the
scriptures
i
inquire
what
was
the
question
which
drew
out
the
answer
or
caused
jesus
to
utter
the
parable
to
ascertain
its
meaning
we
must
dig
to
the
root
and
ascertain
what
it
was
that
drew
the
saying
out
of
jesus
while
this
was
said
especially
in
relation
to
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
it
may
well
be
given
a
wider
application
and
it
will
be
found
a
great
aid
in
arriving
at
the
truth
of
many
supposedly
hard
sayings
of
the
scriptures
but
while
this
key
or
rule
of
interpretation
was
doubtless
of
great
service
to
the
prophet
in
his
study
of
the
scriptures
he
was
helped
in
another
and
a
more
important
way
to
understand
them
to
understand
them
in
a
manner
which
i
can
not
explain
better
than
by
quoting
a
passage
with
which
he
dealt
at
an
earlier
date
than
the
period
with
which
i
am
now
dealing
but
which
is
of
such
moment
and
helps
to
illustrate
the
work
we
find
him
doing
at
nauvoo
during
this
interim
of
peace
that
we
can
well
afford
to
stop
and
consider
it
as
early
as
the
prophet
with
sidney
rigdon
set
about
the
task
of
bringing
forth
a
new
and
inspired
translation
of
the
bible
their
work
extended
also
into
the
year
on
the
day
of
february
of
that
year
they
came
in
the
course
of
their
work
to
the
verse
of
the
fifth
chapter
of
john
gospel
speaking
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
concerning
those
who
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
man
and
shall
come
forth
and
which
in
our
common
version
stands
and
shall
come
forth
they
that
have
done
good
unto
the
resurrection
of
life
and
they
that
have
done
evil
unto
the
resurrection
of
damnation
but
to
the
prophet
it
was
given
and
shall
come
forth
they
who
have
done
good
in
the
resurrection
of
the
just
and
they
who
have
done
evil
in
the
resurrection
of
the
unjust
then
follows
upon
this
rendering
of
the
passage
by
the
spirit
a
revelation
concerning
the
future
state
of
man
and
the
different
degrees
of
glory
which
he
will
inherit
the
like
of
which
is
not
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
all
that
is
written
among
the
children
of
men
and
which
in
part
i
quote
reverting
to
the
passage
as
given
by
the
spirit
the
prophet
says
now
this
caused
us
to
marvel
for
it
was
given
unto
us
of
the
spirit
and
while
we
meditated
upon
these
things
the
lord
touched
the
eyes
of
our
understandings
and
they
were
opened
and
the
glory
of
god
shone
round
about
the
vision
of
the
son
glory
and
we
beheld
the
glory
of
the
son
on
the
right
hand
of
the
father
and
received
of
his
fullness
and
saw
the
holy
angels
and
they
who
are
sanctified
before
his
throne
worshiping
god
and
the
lamb
who
worship
him
for
ever
and
ever
and
now
after
the
many
testimonies
which
have
been
given
of
him
this
is
the
testimony
last
of
all
which
we
give
of
him
that
he
lives
for
we
saw
him
even
on
the
right
hand
of
god
and
we
heard
the
voice
bearing
record
that
he
is
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
that
by
him
and
through
him
and
of
him
the
worlds
are
and
were
created
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
begotten
sons
and
daughters
unto
god
the
fall
of
lucifer
and
this
we
saw
also
and
bear
record
that
an
angel
of
god
who
was
in
authority
in
the
presence
of
god
who
rebelled
against
the
only
begotten
son
whom
the
father
loved
and
who
was
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
was
thrust
down
from
the
presence
of
god
and
the
son
and
was
called
perdition
for
the
heavens
wept
over
him
he
was
lucifer
a
son
of
the
morning
and
we
beheld
and
lo
he
is
fallen
is
fallen
even
a
son
of
the
morning
and
while
we
were
yet
in
the
spirit
the
lord
commanded
us
that
we
should
write
the
vision
for
we
beheld
satan
that
old
serpent
even
the
devil
who
rebelled
against
god
and
sought
to
take
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
his
christ
wherefore
he
maketh
war
with
the
saints
of
god
and
encompasses
them
round
about
and
we
saw
a
vision
of
the
sufferings
of
those
with
whom
he
made
war
and
overcame
for
thus
came
the
voice
of
the
lord
unto
us
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
all
those
who
know
my
power
and
have
been
made
partakers
thereof
and
suffered
themselves
through
the
power
of
the
devil
to
be
overcome
and
to
deny
the
truth
and
defy
my
power
they
are
they
who
are
the
sons
of
perdition
of
whom
i
say
that
it
had
been
better
for
them
never
to
have
been
born
for
they
are
vessels
of
wrath
doomed
to
suffer
the
wrath
of
god
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
in
eternity
concerning
whom
i
have
said
there
is
no
forgiveness
in
this
world
nor
in
the
world
to
come
having
denied
the
holy
spirit
after
having
received
it
and
having
denied
the
only
begotten
son
of
the
father
having
crucified
him
unto
themselves
and
put
him
to
an
open
shame
these
are
they
who
shall
go
away
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
and
the
only
ones
on
whom
the
second
death
shall
have
any
power
yea
verily
the
only
ones
who
shall
not
be
redeemed
in
the
due
time
of
the
lord
after
the
sufferings
of
his
wrath
for
all
the
rest
shall
be
brought
forth
by
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
through
the
triumph
and
the
glory
of
the
lamb
who
was
slain
who
was
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
before
the
worlds
were
made
and
this
is
the
gospel
the
glad
tidings
which
the
voice
out
of
the
heavens
bore
record
unto
us
that
he
came
into
the
world
even
jesus
to
be
crucified
for
the
world
and
to
bear
the
sins
of
the
world
and
to
sanctify
the
world
and
to
cleanse
it
from
all
unrighteousness
that
through
him
all
might
be
saved
whom
the
father
had
put
into
his
power
and
made
by
him
who
glorifies
the
father
and
saves
all
the
works
of
his
hands
except
those
sons
of
perdition
who
deny
the
son
after
the
father
has
revealed
him
wherefore
he
saves
all
except
them
they
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
punishment
which
is
endless
punishment
which
is
eternal
punishment
to
reign
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
in
eternity
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
which
is
their
torment
and
the
end
thereof
neither
the
place
thereof
nor
their
torment
no
man
knows
neither
was
it
revealed
neither
is
neither
will
be
revealed
unto
man
except
to
them
who
are
made
partakers
thereof
nevertheless
i
the
lord
show
it
by
vision
unto
many
but
straightway
shut
it
up
again
wherefore
the
end
the
width
the
height
the
depth
and
the
misery
thereof
they
understand
not
neither
any
man
except
them
who
are
ordained
unto
this
condemnation
and
we
heard
the
voice
saying
write
the
vision
for
lo
this
is
the
end
of
the
vision
of
the
sufferings
of
the
ungodly
of
those
who
inherit
the
celestial
glory
and
again
we
bear
record
for
we
saw
and
heard
and
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
gospel
of
christ
concerning
them
who
come
forth
in
the
resurrection
of
the
just
they
are
they
who
received
the
testimony
of
jesus
and
believed
on
his
name
and
were
baptized
after
the
manner
of
his
burial
being
buried
in
the
water
in
his
name
and
this
according
to
the
commandment
which
he
has
given
that
by
keeping
the
commandments
they
might
be
washed
and
cleansed
from
all
their
sins
and
receive
the
holy
spirit
by
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
him
who
is
ordained
and
scaled
unto
this
power
and
who
overcome
by
faith
and
are
sealed
by
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
which
the
father
sheds
forth
upon
all
those
who
are
just
and
true
they
are
they
who
are
the
church
of
the
first
born
they
are
they
into
whose
hands
the
father
has
given
all
things
they
are
they
who
are
priests
and
kings
who
have
received
of
his
fullness
and
of
his
glory
and
are
priests
of
the
most
high
after
the
order
of
melchisedek
which
was
after
the
order
of
enoch
which
was
after
the
order
of
the
only
begotten
son
wherefore
as
it
is
written
they
are
gods
even
the
sons
of
god
wherefore
all
things
are
theirs
whether
life
or
death
or
things
present
or
things
to
come
all
are
theirs
and
they
are
and
christ
is
god
and
they
shall
overcome
all
things
wherefore
let
no
man
glory
in
man
but
rather
let
him
glory
in
god
who
shall
subdue
all
enemies
under
his
feet
these
shall
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
and
his
christ
for
ever
and
ever
these
are
they
whom
he
shall
bring
with
him
when
he
shall
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
to
reign
on
the
earth
over
his
people
these
are
they
who
shall
have
part
in
the
first
resurrection
these
are
they
who
shall
come
forth
in
the
resurrection
of
the
just
these
are
they
who
are
come
unto
mount
zion
and
unto
the
city
of
the
living
god
the
heavenly
place
the
holiest
of
all
these
are
they
who
have
come
to
an
innumerable
company
of
angels
to
the
general
assembly
and
church
of
enoch
and
of
the
first
born
these
are
they
whose
names
are
written
in
heaven
where
god
and
christ
are
the
judge
of
all
these
are
they
who
are
just
men
made
perfect
through
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
who
wrought
out
this
perfect
atonement
through
the
shedding
of
his
own
blood
these
are
they
whose
bodies
are
celestial
whose
glory
is
that
of
the
sun
even
the
glory
of
god
the
highest
of
all
whose
glory
the
sun
of
the
firmament
is
written
of
as
being
typical
those
of
the
terrestrial
glory
and
again
we
saw
the
terrestrial
world
and
behold
and
lo
these
are
they
who
are
of
the
terrestrial
whose
glory
differs
from
that
of
the
church
of
the
first
born
who
have
received
the
fullness
of
the
father
even
as
that
of
the
moon
differs
from
the
sun
in
the
firmament
behold
these
are
they
who
died
without
law
and
also
they
who
are
the
spirits
of
men
kept
in
prison
whom
the
son
visited
and
preached
the
gospel
unto
them
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
who
received
not
the
testimony
of
jesus
in
the
flesh
but
afterwards
received
it
these
are
they
who
are
honorable
men
of
the
earth
who
were
blinded
by
the
craftiness
of
men
these
are
they
who
receive
of
his
glory
but
not
of
his
fullness
these
are
they
who
receive
of
the
presence
of
the
son
but
not
of
the
fullness
of
the
father
wherefore
they
are
bodies
terrestrial
and
not
bodies
celestial
and
differ
in
glory
as
the
moon
differs
from
the
sun
these
are
they
who
are
not
valiant
in
the
testimony
of
jesus
wherefore
they
obtain
not
the
crown
over
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
now
this
is
the
end
of
the
vision
which
we
saw
of
the
terrestrial
that
the
lord
commanded
us
to
write
while
we
were
yet
in
the
spirit
those
who
inherit
the
telestial
glory
and
again
we
saw
the
glory
of
the
telestial
which
glory
is
that
of
the
lesser
even
as
the
glory
of
the
stars
differs
from
that
of
the
glory
of
the
moon
in
the
firmament
these
are
they
who
received
not
the
gospel
of
christ
neither
the
testimony
of
jesus
these
are
they
who
deny
not
the
holy
spirit
these
are
they
who
are
thrust
down
to
hell
these
are
they
who
shall
not
be
redeemed
from
the
devil
until
the
last
resurrection
until
the
lord
even
christ
the
lamb
shall
have
finished
his
work
these
are
they
who
receive
not
of
his
fullness
in
the
eternal
world
but
of
the
holy
spirit
through
the
ministration
of
the
terrestrial
and
the
terrestrial
through
the
ministration
of
the
celestial
and
also
the
telestial
receive
it
of
the
administering
of
angels
who
are
appointed
to
minister
for
them
or
who
are
appointed
to
be
ministering
spirits
for
them
for
they
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation
summary
of
the
great
vision
and
thus
we
saw
in
the
heavenly
vision
the
glory
of
the
telestial
which
surpasses
all
understanding
and
no
man
knows
it
except
him
to
whom
god
has
revealed
it
and
thus
we
saw
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
which
excels
in
all
things
the
glory
of
the
telestial
even
in
glory
and
in
power
and
in
might
and
in
dominion
and
thus
we
saw
the
glory
of
the
celestial
which
excels
in
all
things
where
god
even
the
father
reigns
upon
his
throne
for
ever
and
ever
before
whose
throne
all
things
bow
in
humble
reverence
and
give
him
glory
for
ever
and
ever
they
who
dwell
in
his
presence
are
the
church
of
the
first
born
and
they
see
as
they
are
seen
and
know
as
they
are
known
having
received
of
his
fullness
and
of
his
grace
and
he
makes
them
equal
in
power
and
in
might
and
in
dominion
and
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
even
as
the
glory
of
the
sun
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
one
even
as
the
glory
of
the
moon
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
telestial
is
one
even
as
the
glory
of
the
stars
is
one
for
as
one
star
differs
from
another
star
in
glory
even
so
differs
one
from
another
in
glory
in
the
telestial
world
for
these
are
they
who
are
of
paul
and
of
apollos
and
of
cephas
these
are
they
who
say
they
are
some
of
one
and
some
of

some
of

and
some
of
john
and
some
of
moses
and
some
of

and
some

but
receive
not
the
gospel
neither
the
testimony
of
jesus
neither
the
prophets
neither
the
everlasting
covenant
last
of
all
these
all
are
they
who
will
not
be
gathered
with
the
saints
to
be
caught
up
unto
the
church
of
the

these

are
liars

whosoever
loves
and
makes
a
lie
these
are
they
who
suffer
the
wrath
of

on

these
are
they
who
suffer
the
vengeance
of
eternal
fire
these
are
they
who
are
cast
down
to

and
suffer
the
wrath
of
almighty
god
until
the
fullness
of
times
when
christ
shall
have
subdued
all
enemies
under
his
feet
and
shall
have
perfected
his
work
when
he
shall
deliver
up
the
kingdom
and
present
it
unto
the
father
spotless
saying
i
have
overcome
and
have
trodden
the
alone
even
the
of
the
fierceness
of
the
wrath
of
almighty
god
then
shall
he
be
crowned
with
the
crown
of
his
glory
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
his
power
to
reign
for
ever
and
ever
but
behold
and
lo
we
saw
the
glory
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
telestial
world
that
they
were
as
innumerable
as
the
stars
in
the
firmament
of
heaven
or
as
the
sand
upon
the
sea
shore
and
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
these
all
shall
bow
the
knee
and
every
tongue
shall
confess
to
him
who
sits
upon
the
throne
for
ever
and
ever
for
they
shall
be
judged
according
to
their
works
and
every
man
shall
receive
according
to
his
own
works
his
own
dominion
in
the
mansions
which
are
prepared
and
they
shall
be
servants
of
the
most
high
but
where
god
and
christ
dwell
they
can
not
come
worlds
without
end
this
is
the
end
of
the
vision
which
we
saw
which
we
were
commanded
to
write
while
we
were
yet
in
the
spirit
but
great
and
marvelous
are
the
works
of
the
lord
and
the
mysteries
of
his
kingdom
which
he
showed
unto
us
which
surpasses
all
understanding
in
glory
and
in
might
and
in
dominion
which
he
commanded
us
we
should
not
write
while
we
were
yet
in
the
spirit
and
are
not
lawful
for
man
to
utter
neither
is
man
capable
to
make
them
known
for
they
are
only
to
be
seen
and
understood
by
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
which
god
bestows
on
those
who
love
him
and
purify
themselves
before
him
to
whom
he
grants
this
privilege
of
seeing
and
knowing
for
themselves
that
through
the
power
and
manifestation
of
the
spirit
while
in
the
flesh
they
may
be
able
to
bear
his
presence
in
the
world
of
glory

amen
chapter
xxvii
doctrinal
development
at
nauvoo
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
resurrection
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
preaching
of
alexander
campbell
the
founder
of
the
church
of
the
disciples
or
christians
had
a
widespread
influence
in
the
western
states
of
the
union
including
illinois
among
other
things
taught
by
him
in
his
public
ministry
was
that
the
baptism
of
john
was
not
identical
with
christian
baptism
and
that
the
kingdom
of
god
was
not
set
up
in
the
earth
until
after
the
son
of
god
was
glorified
and
the
day
of
pentecost
was
come
it
was
perhaps
because
of
the
very
extended
acceptance
of
these
views
throughout
the
west
which
led
the
prophet
to
make
the
following
comprehensive
remarks
about
the
baptism
of
john
and
the
kingdom
of
god
of
john
baptism
some
say
the
kingdom
of
god
was
not
set
up
until
the
day
of
pentecost
and
that
john
did
not
preach
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
but
i
say
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
the
kingdom
of
god
was
set
up
on
the
earth
from
the
days
of
adam
to
the
present
time
as
touching
the
gospel
and
baptism
that
john
preached
i
would
say
that
john
came
preaching
the
gospel
for
the
remission
of
sins
he
had
his
authority
from
god
and
the
oracles
of
god
were
with
him
and
the
kingdom
of
god
for
a
season
seemed
to
rest
with
john
alone
john
was
a
priest
after
the
order
of
aaron
and
had
the
keys
of
that
priesthood
and
came
forth
preaching
repentance
and
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
but
at
the
same
time
cries
out
there
cometh
one
after
me
more
mighty
than
i
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
and
christ
came
according
to
the
words
of
john
and
he
was
greater
than
john
because
he
held
the
keys
of
the
melchisedek
priesthood
and
kingdom
of
god
and
had
before
revealed
the
priesthood
to
moses
yet
christ
was
baptized
by
john
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
john
preached
the
same
gospel
and
baptism
that
jesus
and
the
apostles
preached
after
him
the
endowment
was
to
prepare
the
disciples
for
their
mission
unto
the
world
of
the
kingdom
of
god
whenever
there
has
been
a
righteous
man
on
earth
unto
whom
god
revealed
his
word
and
gave
power
and
authority
to
administer
in
his
name
and
where
there
is
a
priest
of
god
a
minister
who
has
power
and
authority
from
god
to
administer
in
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
and
officiate
in
the
priesthood
of
god
there
is
the
kingdom
of
god
and
in
consequence
of
rejecting
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
and
the
prophets
whom
god
had
sent
the
judgments
of
god
have
rested
upon
peoples
cities
and
nations
in
various
ages
of
the
world
which
was
the
case
with
the
cities
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
which
were
destroyed
for
rejecting
the
prophets
whenever
men
can
find
out
the
will
of
god
and
find
an
administrator
legally
authorized
from
god
there
is
the
kingdom
of
god
but
where
these
are
not
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
all
the
ordinances
systems
and
administrations
on
the
earth
are
of
no
use
to
the
children
of
men
unless
they
are
ordained
and
authorized
of
god
for
nothing
will
save
a
man
but
a
legal
administration
for
none
other
will
be
acknowledged
either
by
god
or
angels
some
say
the
kingdom
of
god
was
not
set
up
until
the
day
of
pentecost
and
that
john
did
not
preach
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
but
i
say
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
the
kingdom
of
god
was
set
up
on
the
earth
from
the
days
of
adam
to
the
present
time
now
i
will
give
my
testimony
i
care
not
for
man
i
speak
boldly
and
faithfully
and
with
authority
how
is
it
with
the
kingdom
of
god
where
did
the
kingdom
of
god
begin
where
there
is
no
kingdom
of
god
there
is
no
salvation
what
constitutes
the
kingdom
of
god
where
there
is
a
prophet
a
priest
or
a
righteous
man
unto
whom
god
gives
his
oracles
there
is
the
kingdom
of
god
and
where
the
oracles
of
god
are
not
there
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
in
these
remarks
i
have
no
allusion
to
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
we
will
keep
the
laws
of
the
land
we
do
not
speak
against
them
we
never
have
and
we
can
hardly
make
mention
of
the
state
of
missouri
of
our
persecutions
there
but
what
the
cry
goes
forth
that
we
are
guilty
of
larceny
burglary
arson
treason
murder
which
is
false
we
speak
of
the
kingdom
of
god
on
the
earth
not
the
kingdoms
of
men
but
says
one
the
kingdom
of
god
could
not
be
set
up
in
the
days
of
john
for
john
said
the
kingdom
was
at
hand
but
i
would
ask
if
it
could
be
any
nearer
to
them
than
to
be
in
the
hands
of
john
the
people
need
not
wait
for
the
day
of
pentecost
to
find
the
kingdom
of
god
for
john
had
it
with
him
and
he
came
forth
from
the
wilderness
crying
out
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
nigh
at
hand
as
much
as
to
say
out
here
i
have
got
the
kingdom
of
god
and
i
am
coming
after
you
and
if
you
do
receive
it
you
will
be
damned
and
the
scriptures
represent
that
all
jerusalem
went
out
unto
john
baptism
there
was
a
legal
administrator
and
those
that
were
baptized
were
subjects
for
a
king
and
also
the
laws
and
oracles
of
god
were
there
therefore
the
kingdom
of
god
was
there
for
no
man
could
have
better
authority
to
administer
than
john
and
our
savior
submitted
to
that
authority
himself
by
being
baptized
by
john
therefore
the
kingdom
of
god
was
set
up
on
the
earth
even
in
the
days
of
john
again
he
says
except
ye
are
born
of
the
water
and
of
the
spirit
ye
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
and
though
the
heavens
and
earth
should
pass
away
my
words
should
not
pass
away
if
a
man
is
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
get
into
the
kingdom
of
god
it
is
evident
the
kingdom
of
god
was
on
earth
and
john
prepared
subjects
for
the
kingdom
by
preaching
to
them
and
baptizing
them
and
he
prepared
the
way
before
the
savior
or
came
as
a
forerunner
and
prepared
subjects
for
the
preaching
of
christ
and
christ
preached
through
jerusalem
on
the
same
ground
where
john
had
preached
and
when
the
apostles
were
raised
up
they
worked
in
jerusalem
and
jesus
commanded
them
to
tarry
there
until
they
were
endowed
with
power
from
on
high
had
they
not
work
to
do
in
jerusalem
they
did
work
and
prepared
a
people
for
the
pentecost
the
kingdom
of
god
was
with
them
before
the
day
of
pentecost
as
well
as
afterwards
it
is
evident
from
all
this
that
speaking
broadly
with
the
prophet
the
kingdom
of
god
was
the
government
of
god
on
earth
and
in
heaven
whether
that
government
was
manifested
through
the
authority
of
a
single
individual
or
a
complete
system
of
ecclesiastical
or
national
government
this
is
however
speaking
broadly
not
to
say
loosely
and
in
the
same
manner
that
the
subject
is
spoken
of
in
holy
scripture
where
the
phrases
of
god
kingdom
of
heaven
the
church
of
christ
church
of
god
the
are
often
used
interchangeably
and
indiscriminately
to
represent
in
a
general
way
that
divine
institution
which
god
in
whole
or
in
part
from
time
to
time
establishes
to
help
man
in
the
matter
of
his
salvation
but
it
is
proper
for
the
reader
to
know
that
joseph
smith
when
speaking
strictly
recognized
a
distinction
between
the
church
of
jesus
christ
and
the
kingdom
of
god
and
not
only
a
distinction
but
a
separation
of
one
from
the
other
the
kingdom
of
god
according
to
his
teaching
is
to
be
a
political
institution
that
shall
hold
sway
over
all
the
earth
to
which
all
other
governments
will
be
subordinate
and
by
which
they
will
be
dominated
of
this
kingdom
christ
is
the
king
for
he
is
to
reign
king
of
kings
as
well
as
lord
of
lords
while
all
governments
are
to
be
in
subjection
to
the
kingdom
of
god
it
does
not
follow
that
all
its
members
will
be
of
one
religious
faith
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
necessarily
made
up
exclusively
of
members
of
the
church
of
christ
in
fact
the
prophet
taught
that
men
not
members
of
the
church
could
be
not
only
members
of
that
kingdom
but
also
officers
within
it
it
is
to
grant
the
widest
religious
toleration
though
exacting
homage
and
loyalty
to
its
great
head
to
its
institutions
and
obedience
to
its
laws
on
the
other
hand
the
church
of
christ
is
purely
an
ecclesiastical
organization
comprising
within
its
membership
only
those
who
have
embraced
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
who
inwardly
have
accepted
its
principles
in
their
faith
and
outwardly
have
received
the
rites
and
ceremonies
it
prescribes
of
this
church
jesus
christ
is
the
head
since
he
is
to
be
lord
of
lords
as
well
as
king
of
kings
the
church
is
peculiarly
christ
it
bears
his
name
it
is
composed
of
members
who
while
not
behind
others
in
doing
him
homage
as
the
head
of
the
kingdom
of
god
accept
him
as
more
than
the
king
of
kings
they
accept
him
as
lord
as
lord
of
lords
as
redeemer
savior
god
but
the
church
of
christ
precious
as
it
is
beloved
by
its
great
head
in
the
harmony
of
its
truth
perfect
in
the
beauty
of
its
holiness
passing
all
praise
in
its
power
of
salvation
absolute
yet
the
church
of
christ
will
doubtless
stand
under
the
protecting
aegis
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
common
with
other
systems
of
religion
enjoying
only
such
rights
as
will
be
common
to
all
and
while
the
church
of
christ
will
enjoy
to
the
full
her
privileges
promulgate
her
faith
without
let
or
hindrance
make
known
the
truth
she
holds
and
her
saving
grace
and
power
and
manage
her
own
affairs
yet
she
will
not
usurp
the
prerogative
of
the
kingdom
of
god
nor
interfere
with
those
outside
the
pale
of
her
jurisdiction
outside
of
her
membership
such
in
substance
was
the
teaching
of
the
prophet
on
this
subject
not
publicly
or
at
least
not
very
publicly
but
he
taught
the
foregoing
in
the
counsels
of
the
priesthood
as
many
testify
and
effected
an
organization
as
a
nucleus
of
the
kingdom
above
referred
to
of
which
some
who
were
not
in
the
church
were
members
it
will
be
understood
then
that
what
i
have
quoted
from
the
discourses
on
the
subject
of
the
kingdom
of
god
is
spoken
broadly
in
a
sense
which
recognizes
the
kingdom
of
god
simply
as
the
government
of
god
on
earth
or
in
heaven
and
whether
represented
by
a
single
individual
holding
divine
authority
or
a
regular
system
of
government
and
which
loosely
may
be
and
is
applied
to
the
church
of
christ
or
some
part
thereof
the
glorious
coming
of
the
son
of
god
it
was
this
year
that
the
speculations
of
william
miller
fixed
upon
for
the
glorious
coming
of
the
son
of
god
to
reign
with
his
saints
on
the
earth
for
a
thousand
years
though
miller
was
but
a
religious
enthusiast
yet
his
teachings
and
his
deductions
from
the
prophecies
of
daniel
and
john
the
revelator
created
no
little
stir
throughout
the
united
states
and
many
thousands
of
people
were
looking
for
the
appearing
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
expecting
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
to
begin
and
the
promised
reign
of
righteousness
to
follow
the
agitation
concerning
this
great
event
naturally
led
to
many
inquiries
being
submitted
to
the
prophet
concerning
it
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
boldly
cross
the
statements
of
miller
on
the
subject
and
contradict
his
deductions
based
upon
the
predictions
of
the
prophets
joseph
smith
stood
at
the
head
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
and
he
knew
too
well
the
then
present
status
of
the
work
of
god
to
be
deceived
into
believing
that
the
time
for
the
coming
of
the
son
of
god
had
arrived
the
great
preliminary
work
which
is
to
precede
that
great
event
had
not
been
accomplished
and
until
that
work
was
done
the
prophet
knew
that
jesus
would
not
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
in
power
and
great
glory
it
was
reported
in
the
chicago
that
one
hyrum
redding
had
actually
seen
the
promised
sign
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
concerning
which
joseph
in
a
communication
to
the
and
said
redding
may
have
seen
a
wonderful
appearance
in
the
clouds
one
morning
about
sunrise
which
is
nothing
very
uncommon
in
the
winter
season
he
has
not
seen
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
as
foretold
by
jesus
neither
has
any
man
nor
will
any
man
until
after
the
sun
has
been
darkened
and
the
moon
bathed
in
blood
for
the
lord
hath
not
shown
me
any
such
sign
and
as
the
prophet
saith
so
it
must
be
surely
the
lord
god
will
do
nothing
but
he
revealeth
his
secret
unto
his
servants
the
prophets
see
amos
iii
therefore
hear
this
o
earth
the
lord
will
not
come
to
reign
over
the
righteous
in
this
world
in
nor
until
everything
for
the
bridegroom
is
ready
referring
again
to
the
subject
some
time
later
he
said
in
a
public
discourse
i
was
once
praying
very
earnestly
to
know
the
time
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
when
i
heard
a
voice
repeat
the
following
joseph
my
son
if
thou
livest
until
thou
art
years
old
thou
shalt
see
the
face
of
the
son
of
man
therefore
let
this
suffice
and
trouble
me
no
more
on
this
matter
i
was
left
thus
without
being
able
to
decide
whether
this
coming
referred
to
the
beginning
of
the
millennium
or
to
some
previous
appearing
or
whether
i
should
die
and
thus
see
his
face
i
believe
that
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
will
not
be
any
sooner
than
that
time
on
still
another
occasion
the
prophet
said
were
i
going
to
prophesy
i
would
say
the
end
will
not
come
in
or
or
in
forty
years
there
are
those
of
the
rising
generation
who
shall
not
taste
death
until
christ
comes
i
was
once
praying
earnestly
upon
this
subject
and
a
voice
said
unto
me
my
son
if
thou
livest
until
thou
art
years
of
age
thou
shalt
see
the
face
of
the
son
of
man
i
was
left
to
draw
my
own
conclusion
concerning
this
and
i
took
the
liberty
to
conclude
that
if
i
did
live
to
that
time
he
would
make
his
appearance
but
i
do
not
say
whether
he
will
make
his
appearance
or
i
shall
go
where
he
is
i
prophesy
in
the
name
of
the
lord
god
and
let
it
be
written
the
son
of
man
will
not
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
till
i
am
years
old
he
then
read
the
fourteenth
chapter
of
revelations
and
verses
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come
and
hosea
chapter
after
two
days
years
which
brings
it
to
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
never
will
be
never
can
be
till
the
judgments
spoken
of
for
this
hour
are
poured
out
which
judgments
are
commenced
paul
says
ye
are
children
of
the
light
and
not
of
the
darkness
that
that
day
should
overtake
you
as
a
thief
in
the
night
it
is
not
the
design
of
the
almighty
to
come
upon
the
earth
and
crush
it
and
grind
it
to
powder
but
he
will
reveal
it
to
his
servants
the
prophets
judah
must
return
jerusalem
must
be
rebuilt
and
the
temple
and
water
come
out
from
under
the
temple
and
the
waters
of
the
dead
sea
be
healed
it
will
take
some
time
to
build
the
walls
of
the
city
and
the
temple
and
all
this
must
be
done
before
the
son
of
man
will
make
his
appearance
there
will
be
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
signs
in
the
heaven
above
and
on
the
earth
beneath
the
sun
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
to
blood
earthquakes
in
divers
places
the
seas
heaving
beyond
their
bounds
there
will
appear
one
grand
sign
of
the
son
of
man
in
heaven
but
what
will
the
world
do
they
will
say
it
is
a
comet
a
planet
etc
but
the
son
of
man
will
come
as
the
sign
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
which
will
be
as
the
light
of
the
morning
cometh
coming
out
of
the
east
i
would
again
remind
the
reader
that
these
reports
of
remarks
and
discourses
of
the
prophet
are
imperfect
having
been
written
in
and
in
part
from
memory
and
therefore
really
are
only
synopses
of
what
was
said
i
call
attention
to
this
at
this
point
because
the
imperfections
in
construction
of
the
above
are
very
apparent
so
also
the
fact
that
the
report
in
this
case
is
very
much
abbreviated
still
the
substance
the
great
facts
concerning
the
work
to
precede
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
and
the
prediction
that
the
son
of
man
will
not
come
until
that
work
is
performed
are
all
there
and
that
is
the
important
thing
of
the
appearance
of
the
savior
when
he
does
come
the
prophet
said
when
the
savior
shall
appear
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
we
shall
see
that
he
is
a
man
like
ourselves
and
the
same
sociality
which
exists
among
us
here
will
exist
among
us
there
only
it
will
be
coupled
with
eternal
glory
which
glory
we
do
not
now
enjoy
of
the
resurrection
no
less
interesting
were
the
prophet
teaching
on
the
subject
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
to
a
remark
of
elder
orson
pratt
to
the
effect
that
a
man
body
changes
every
seven
years
the
prophet
replied
there
is
no
fundamental
principle
belonging
to
a
human
system
that
ever
goes
into
another
in
this
world
or
in
the
world
to
come
i
care
not
what
the
theories
of
men
are
we
have
the
testimony
that
god
will
raise
us
up
and
he
has
the
power
to
do
it
if
any
one
supposes
that
any
part
of
our
bodies
that
is
the
fundamental
parts
thereof
ever
goes
into
another
body
he
is
mistaken
speaking
of
the
desirability
of
an
honorable
burial
and
of
living
and
dying
among
friends
in
connection
with
the
resurrection
the
prophet
said
at
the
funeral
services
held
in
honor
of
lorenzo
barnes
who
had
died
while
on
a
mission
to
england
i
believe
those
who
have
buried
their
dead
here
their
condition
is
enviable
look
at
jacob
and
joseph
in
egypt
how
they
required
their
friends
to
bury
them
in
the
tomb
of
their
fathers
see
the
expense
which
attended
the
embalming
and
the
going
up
of
the
great
company
to
the
burial
it
has
always
been
considered
a
great
calamity
not
to
obtain
an
honorable
burial
and
one
of
the
greatest
curses
the
ancient
prophets
could
put
on
any
man
was
that
he
should
go
without
a
burial
i
would
esteem
it
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
if
i
am
going
to
be
afflicted
in
this
world
to
have
my
lot
cast
where
i
can
find
brothers
and
friends
all
around
me
but
this
is
not
the
thing
i
referred
to
it
is
to
have
the
privilege
of
having
our
dead
buried
on
the
land
where
god
has
appointed
to
gather
his
saints
together
and
where
there
will
be
none
but
saints
where
they
may
have
the
privilege
of
laying
their
bodies
where
the
son
of
man
will
make
his
appearance
and
where
they
may
hear
the
sound
of
the
trump
that
shall
call
them
forth
to
behold
him
that
in
the
morn
of
the
resurrection
they
may
come
forth
in
a
body
and
come
up
out
of
their
graves
and
strike
hands
immediately
in
eternal
glory
and
felicity
rather
than
be
scattered
thousands
of
miles
apart
there
is
something
good
and
sacred
to
me
in
this
thing
the
place
where
a
man
is
buried
is
sacred
to
me
this
subject
is
made
mention
of
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
the
scriptures
even
to
the
aborigines
of
this
land
the
burying
places
of
their
fathers
are
more
sacred
than
anything
else
when
i
heard
of
the
death
of
our
beloved
brother
barnes
it
would
not
have
affected
me
so
much
if
i
had
the
opportunity
of
burying
him
in
the
land
of
zion
i
have
said
father
i
desire
to
die
here
among
the
saints
but
if
this
is
not
thy
will
and
i
go
hence
and
die
wilt
thou
find
some
kind
friend
and
bring
my
body
back
and
gather
my
friends
who
have
fallen
in
foreign
lands
and
bring
them
up
hither
that
we
may
all
lie
together
if
tomorrow
i
shall
be
called
to
lie
in
yonder
tomb
in
the
morning
of
the
resurrection
let
me
strike
hands
with
my
father
and
cry
my
father
father
and
he
will
say
my
son
my
son
as
soon
as
the
rocks
rend
and
before
we
come
out
of
our
graves
and
may
we
contemplate
these
things
so
yes
if
we
learn
how
to
live
and
how
to
die
when
we
lie
down
we
contemplate
how
we
may
rise
up
in
the
morning
and
it
is
pleasing
for
friends
to
lie
down
together
locked
in
the
arms
of
love
to
sleep
and
wake
in
each
others
embrace
and
renew
their
conversation
would
you
think
it
strange
if
i
relate
what
i
have
seen
in
vision
in
relation
to
this
interesting
theme
those
who
have
died
in
jesus
christ
may
expect
to
enter
into
all
that
fruition
of
joy
when
they
come
forth
which
they
possessed
or
anticipated
here
so
plain
was
the
vision
that
i
actually
saw
men
before
they
had
ascended
from
the
tomb
as
though
they
were
getting
up
slowly
they
took
each
other
by
the
hand
and
said
to
each
other
my
father
my
son
my
mother
my
daughter
my
brother
my
sister
and
when
the
voice
calls
for
the
dead
to
rise
suppose
i
am
laid
by
the
side
of
my
father
what
would
be
the
first
joy
of
my
heart
to
meet
my
father
my
mother
my
brother
my
sister
and
when
they
are
by
my
side
i
embrace
them
and
they
me
it
is
my
meditation
all
the
day
and
more
than
my
meat
and
drink
to
know
how
i
shall
make
the
saints
of
god
comprehend
the
visions
that
roll
like
an
overflowing
surge
before
my
mind
lay
hold
of
these
things
and
let
not
your
knees
or
joints
tremble
nor
your
heart
faint
and
then
what
can
earthquakes
wars
and
tornadoes
do
nothing
all
your
losses
will
be
made
up
to
you
in
the
resurrection
provided
you
continue
faithful
by
the
vision
of
the
almighty
i
have
seen
it
more
painful
to
me
are
the
thoughts
of
annihilation
than
death
if
i
had
no
expectation
of
seeing
my
father
mother
brothers
sisters
and
friends
again
my
heart
would
burst
in
a
moment
and
i
should
go
down
to
my
grave
the
expectation
of
seeing
my
friends
in
the
morning
of
the
resurrection
cheers
my
soul
and
makes
me
bear
up
against
the
evils
of
life
it
is
like
their
taking
a
long
journey
and
on
their
return
we
meet
them
with
increased
joy
god
has
revealed
his
son
from
the
heavens
and
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
also
and
we
have
a
knowledge
that
those
we
bring
here
god
will
bring
up
again
clothed
upon
and
quickened
by
the
spirit
of
the
great
god
and
what
mattereth
it
whether
we
lay
them
down
or
we
lay
down
with
them
when
we
can
keep
them
no
longer
then
let
them
sink
down
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
the
mighty
anchor
holds
her
safe
so
let
these
truths
sink
down
in
our
hearts
that
we
may
even
here
begin
to
enjoy
that
which
shall
be
in
full
hereafter
hosanna
hosanna
hosanna
to
almighty
god
that
rays
of
light
begin
to
burst
forth
upon
us
even
now
god
and
angels
time
in
answer
to
the
question
is
not
the
reckoning
of
god
time
angels
time
prophets
time
and
man
time
according
to
the
planet
on
which
they
reside
i
answer
yes
but
there
are
no
angels
who
minister
to
this
earth
but
those
who
belong
or
have
belonged
to
it
the
angels
do
not
reside
on
a
planet
like
this
earth
but
they
reside
in
the
presence
of
god
on
a
globe
like
a
sea
of
glass
and
fire
where
all
things
for
their
glory
are
manifest
past
present
and
future
and
are
continually
before
the
lord
the
earth
in
its
sanctified
state
the
following
is
an
entry
in
his
journal
saturday
of
february
while
at
dinner
i
remarked
to
my
family
and
friends
present
that
when
the
earth
was
sanctified
and
became
like
a
sea
of
glass
it
would
be
one
great
urim
and
thummim
and
the
saints
could
look
in
it
and
see
as
they
are
seen
later
in
public
on
the
same
subject
he
said
the
place
where
god
resides
is
a
great
urim
and
thummim
this
earth
in
its
sanctified
and
immortal
state
will
be
made
like
unto
crystal
and
will
be
a
urim
and
thummim
to
the
inhabitants
who
dwell
thereon
whereby
all
things
pertaining
to
an
inferior
kingdom
or
all
kingdoms
of
a
lower
order
will
be
manifest
to
those
who
dwell
on
it
and
this
earth
will
be
christ
then
the
white
stone
mentioned
in
revelation
ii
will
become
a
urim
and
thummim
to
each
individual
who
receives
one
whereby
things
pertaining
to
a
higher
order
of
kingdoms
will
be
made
known
and
a
white
stone
is
given
to
each
of
those
who
come
into
the
celestial
kingdom
whereon
is
a
new
name
written
which
no
man
knoweth
save
he
that
receiveth
it
the
new
name
is
the
key
word
chapter
xxviii
doctrinal
development
prophecies
this
period
under
consideration
was
rich
in
prophecies
the
boldness
of
joseph
smith
predictions
was
startling
but
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
they
have
been
fulfilled
as
fast
as
the
wheels
of
time
have
brought
them
due
a
prediction
upon
the
present
generation
i
prophesy
in
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
anguish
and
wrath
and
tribulation
and
the
withdrawing
of
the
spirit
of
god
from
the
earth
await
this
generation
until
they
are
visited
with
utter
desolation
this
generation
is
as
corrupt
as
the
generation
of
the
jews
that
crucified
christ
and
if
he
were
here
today
and
should
preach
the
same
doctrine
he
did
then
they
would
put
him
to
death
i
defy
all
the
world
to
destroy
the
work
of
god
and
i
prophesy
they
never
will
have
power
to
kill
me
till
my
work
is
accomplished
and
i
am
ready
to
die
prophecy
on
war
i
prophesy
in
the
name
of
the
lord
god
that
the
commencement
of
the
difficulties
which
will
cause
much
bloodshed
previous
to
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
will
be
in
south
carolina
it
may
probably
arise
through
the
slave
question
this
a
voice
declared
to
me
while
i
was
praying
very
earnestly
on
the
subject
december
these
remarks
were
made
in
april
at
a
place
called
raymus
near
nauvoo
and
the
incidental
reference
to
what
a
voice
had
declared
to
him
respecting
the
war
to
begin
in
south
carolina
is
doubtless
an
allusion
to
the
more
formal
prophecy
on
that
great
subject
and
which
i
consider
of
so
much
importance
that
while
it
does
not
strictly
belong
to
the
period
under
consideration
i
give
it
as
connected
with
the
lesser
prophecy
quoted
above
prophecy
on
the
wars
of
the
last
days
verily
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
wars
that
will
shortly
come
to
pass
beginning
at
the
rebellion
of
south
carolina
which
will
eventually
terminate
in
the
death
and
misery
of
many
souls
the
days
will
come
that
war
will
be
poured
out
upon
all
nations
beginning
at
that
place
for
behold
the
southern
states
shall
be
divided
against
the
northern
states
and
the
southern
states
will
call
on
other
nations
even
the
nation
of
great
britain
as
it
is
called
and
they
shall
also
call
upon
other
nations
in
order
to
defend
themselves
against
other
nations
and
thus
war
shall
be
poured
out
upon
all
nations
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
after
many
days
slaves
shall
rise
up
against
their
masters
who
shall
be
marshalled
and
disciplined
for
war
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
also
that
the
remnants
who
are
left
of
the
land
will
marshal
themselves
and
shall
become
exceeding
angry
and
shall
vex
the
gentiles
with
a
sore
vexation
and
thus
with
the
sword
and
by
bloodshed
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
shall
mourn
and
with
famine
and
plague
and
earthquakes
and
the
thunder
of
heaven
and
the
fierce
and
vivid
lightning
also
shall
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
be
made
to
feel
the
wrath
and
indignation
and
chastening
hand
of
an
almighty
god
until
the
consumption
decreed
hath
made
a
full
end
of
all
nations
that
the
cry
of
the
saints
and
of
the
blood
of
the
saints
shall
cease
to
come
up
into
the
ears
of
the
lord
of
sabaoth
from
the
earth
to
be
avenged
of
their
enemies
wherefore
stand
ye
in
holy
places
and
be
not
moved
until
the
day
of
the
lord
come
for
behold
it
cometh
quickly
saith
the
lord
amen
i
do
not
hesitate
to
refer
to
this
prophecy
as
one
of
the
boldest
most
forceful
and
remarkable
ever
uttered
by
a
prophet
of
god
in
either
ancient
or
modern
times
and
its
exact
and
minute
fulfillment
to
be
read
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
other
countries
is
as
astonishing
as
the
prediction
is
bold
this
prophecy
was
given
in
december
and
the
elders
in
those
days
at
least
a
number
of
them
carried
manuscript
copies
of
it
with
them
on
their
missionary
journeys
and
frequently
read
it
to
their
congregations
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
in
volume
xiii
of
the
published
in
pages
is
an
advertisement
of
a
new
publication
to
be
called
the
of
great
in
the
announced
contents
is
named
this
revelation
of
december
on
war
with
the
statement
that
it
had
never
before
appeared
in
print
subsequently
but
in
the
same
year
the
of
great
with
this
prophecy
in
it
word
for
word
as
it
is
here
quoted
was
published
by
franklin
richards
in
liverpool
england
there
are
copies
of
the
first
edition
still
extant
prediction
that
the
saints
would
remove
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
become
a
great
people
no
less
remarkable
perhaps
was
the
prophet
great
prediction
of
the
sixth
of
august
given
in
his
history
under
that
date
and
published
in
the
concerning
the
removal
of
the
saints
to
the
rocky
mountains
then
a
thousand
miles
beyond
the
frontiers
of
the
united
states
but
of
which
i
shall
not
say
more
here
as
it
is
to
receive
consideration
in
a
subsequent
chapter
prophecy
upon
the
head
of
stephen
douglass
in
the
daily
journal
of
wm
clayton
who
at
the
time
the
following
prophecy
was
made
was
private
secretary
of
the
prophet
and
almost
his
constant
companion
under
date
of
may
occurs
the
following
entry
concerning
a
visit
with
the
prophet
to
judge
douglass
at
carthage
dined
with
judge
stephen
douglass
who
is
presiding
at
court
after
dinner
judge
douglass
requested
president
joseph
to
give
him
a
history
of
the
missouri
persecutions
which
he
did
in
a
very
minute
manner
for
about
three
hours
he
also
gave
a
relation
of
his
journey
to
washington
city
and
his
application
in
behalf
of
the
saints
to
van
buren
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
redress
and
van
buren
pusillanimous
reply
gentlemen
your
cause
is
just
but
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
and
the
cold
unfeeling
manner
in
which
he
was
treated
by
most
of
the
senators
and
representatives
in
relation
to
the
subject
clay
saying
you
had
better
go
to
oregon
and
calhoun
shaking
his
head
and
solemnly
saying
it
a
nice
question
a
critical
question
but
it
will
not
do
to
agitate
it
the
judge
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
and
then
spoke
warmly
in
deprecation
of
the
conduct
of
governor
boggs
and
the
authorities
of
missouri
who
had
taken
part
in
the
extermination
and
said
that
any
people
that
would
do
as
the
mobs
of
missouri
had
done
ought
to
be
brought
to
judgment
they
ought
to
be
punished
president
smith
in
concluding
his
remarks
said
that
if
the
government
which
received
into
its
coffers
the
money
of
citizens
for
its
public
lands
while
its
officials
are
rolling
in
luxury
at
the
expense
of
its
public
treasury
can
not
protect
such
citizens
in
their
lives
and
property
it
is
an
old
granny
anyhow
and
i
prophesy
in
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
unless
the
united
states
redress
the
wrongs
committed
upon
the
saints
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
punish
the
crimes
committed
by
her
officers
that
in
a
few
years
the
government
will
be
utterly
overthrown
and
wasted
and
there
will
not
be
so
much
as
a
potsherd
left
for
their
wickedness
in
permitting
the
murder
of
men
women
and
children
and
the
wholesale
plunder
and
extermination
of
thousands
of
her
citizens
to
go
unpunished
thereby
perpetrating
a
foul
and
corroding
blot
upon
the
fair
fame
of
this
great
republic
the
very
thought
of
which
would
have
caused
the
and
patriotic
framers
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
hide
their
faces
with
shame
you
will
aspire
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
and
if
you
ever
turn
your
hand
against
me
or
the
saints
you
will
feel
the
weight
of
the
hand
of
the
almighty
upon
you
and
you
will
live
to
see
and
know
that
i
have
testified
the
truth
to
you
for
the
conversation
of
this
day
will
stick
to
you
through
life
he
appeared
very
friendly
and
acknowledged
the
truth
and
propriety
of
president
smith
this
prophecy
was
published
in
utah
in
the
of
september
and
afterwards
in
england
in
the
of
february
it
is
well
known
that
douglass
did
finally
aspire
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
that
he
was
nominated
by
a
confident
aggressive
party
in
and
it
is
also
known
that
in
the
elections
of
that
year
that
party
which
had
controlled
the
destinies
almost
uninterruptedly
for
forty
years
became
demoralized
that
abraham
lincoln
was
triumphantly
elected
receiving
one
hundred
and
eighty
electoral
votes
while
douglass
received
but
that
douglass
some
six
weeks
later
died
a
disappointed
not
to
say
man
all
this
is
known
but
it
is
not
so
generally
known
that
on
the
twelfth
of
june
about
one
year
after
the
prediction
of
his
friend
joseph
smith
was
published
in
the
in
utah
he
most
cowardly
betrayed
the
people
of
that
friend
and
united
with
their
enemies
in
a
most
unjustifiable
assault
upon
them
and
in
the
fervor
of
his
eloquence
and
to
gain
the
favor
of
the
populace
he
cried
out
against
them
the
knife
must
be
applied
to
this
pestiferous
disgusting
cancer
which
is
gnawing
into
the
very
vitals
of
the
body
politic
it
must
be
cut
out
by
the
roots
and
seared
over
by
the
red
hot
iron
of
stern
and
unflinching
law
repeal
the
organic
law
of
the
territory
on
the
ground
that
they
are
alien
enemies
and
outlaws
unfit
to
be
the
citizens
of
a
territory
much
less
to
ever
become
citizens
of
one
of
the
free
and
independent
states
of
this
confederacy
he
little
dreamed
that
in
these
utterances
he
was
sealing
his
own
political
doom
and
leaving
on
record
an
event
that
was
to
stand
as
a
monument
to
the
inspiration
of

doctrinal
development
at
nauvoo
of
the
being
and
nature
of
god
when
joseph
smith
in
declared
that
he
had
in
open
vision
seen
god
the
father
and
his
son
jesus
christ
standing
together
above
him
in
the
air
surrounded
by
a
glorious
brilliancy
of
light
which
defied
all
description
and
that
god
the
father
pointed
to
jesus
and
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
it
is
quite
evident
that
new
ideas
pertaining
to
god
were
about
to
be
promulgated
among
men
the
facts
of
this
vision
were
quite
at
variance
with
the
orthodox
notions
entertained
about
the
godhead
it
is
quite
true
that
christians
talked
about
the
father
and
the
son
and
as
for
the
latter
they
had
to
concede
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
man
and
remains
so
to
this
day
as
they
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
resurrected
body
of
flesh
and
bones
with
which
jesus
ascended
to
his
father
has
been
dissolved
and
become
incorporeal
but
no
orthodox
christian
believed
that
the
father
and
the
son
of
the
scriptures
were
two
distinct
and
separate
individuals
a
conclusion
which
this
very
first
vision
of
the
prophet
forces
upon
the
understanding
if
it
is
believed
the
anthropomorphism
of
the
vision
is
also
too
emphatic
for
the
orthodox
conception
of
god
for
notwithstanding
the
scriptures
teach
that
man
was
created
in
the
image
of
god
and
that
jesus
christ
was
the
express
image
of
his
person
and
certainly
jesus
was
in
the
form
of
man
yet
the
christian
orthodoxy
gave
such
explanations
of
these
facts
of
scripture
that
they
accepted
not
at
all
the
idea
that
god
the
father
was
a
personage
like
unto
man
in
form
and
as
distinct
as
to
his
person
from
his
son
jesus
christ
as
is
any
father
and
son
among
men
the
orthodox
creed
of
the
godhead
is
as
follows
we
believe
in
one
god
the
father
almighty
the
maker
of
all
things
visible
and
invisible
and
in
one
lord
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
begotten
of
the
father
only
begotten
that
is
of
the
substance
of
the
father
god
of
god
light
of
light
very
god
of
very
god
begotten
not
made
of
the
same
substance
with
the
father
by
whom
all
things
are
made
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
who
for
us
men
and
for
our
salvation
descended
and
was
incarnate
and
became
man
suffered
and
rose
again
the
third
day
ascended
into
the
heavens
and
will
come
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
and
in
the
holy
spirit
but
those
who
say
there
was
a
time
when
he
the
son
was
not
and
that
he
was
not
before
he
was
begotten
and
that
he
was
made
out
of
nothing
or
affirm
that
he
is
of
any
other
substance
or
essence
or
that
the
son
of
god
was
created
and
mutable
or
changeable
the
catholic
church
doth
pronounce
accursed
this
is
the
creed
of
athanasius
formulated
at
the
council
of
nice
and
is
universally
accepted
by
orthodox
christians
the
explanation
of
the
creed
as
given
by
athanasius
will
also
be
of
interest
we
worship
one
god
in
trinity
and
trinity
in
unity
neither
confounding
the
persons
nor
dividing
the
substance
for
there
is
one
person
of
the
father
another
of
the
son
and
another
of
the
holy
ghost
but
the
godhead
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
is
all
one
the
glory
equal
the
majesty
such
as
the
father
is
such
is
the
son
and
such
is
the
holy
ghost
the
father
uncreate
the
son
uncreate
and
the
holy
ghost
uncreate
the
father
incomprehensible
the
son
incomprehensible
the
father
eternal
the
son
eternal
and
the
holy
ghost
eternal
and
yet
these
are
not
three
eternals
but
one
eternal
as
also
there
are
not
three
incomprehensibles
nor
three
uncreated
but
one
uncreated
and
one
incomprehensible
so
likewise
the
father
is
almighty
the
son
almighty
and
the
holy
ghost
almighty
and
yet
there
are
not
three
almighties
but
one
almighty
so
the
father
is
god
the
son
is
god
and
the
holy
ghost
is
god
and
yet
there
are
not
three
gods
but
one
god
it
is
of
course
apparent
at
a
glance
that
the
first
great
revelation
to
joseph
smith
declared
facts
in
relation
to
the
nature
of
god
his
personality
the
fact
that
the
father
was
distinct
from
the
son
the
fact
that
the
there
were
two
or
a
plurality
of
gods
which
are
at
variance
with
the
orthodox
creed
on
the
subject
of
deity
this
truth
he
continued
to
unfold
from
time
to
time
though
the
fullness
and
climax
respecting
this
doctrine
was
reached
at
nauvoo
and
as
it
is
the
teachings
of
the
prophet
and
not
a
defense
of
them
which
i
here
wish
to
exhibit
i
quote
his
own
words
god
distinct
personality
the
father
has
a
body
of
flesh
and
bones
as
tangible
as
a
man
the
son
also
but
the
holy
ghost
has
not
a
body
of
flesh
and
bones
but
is
a
personage
of
spirit
were
it
not
so
the
holy
ghost
could
not
dwell
in
us
a
man
may
receive
the
holy
ghost
and
it
may
descend
upon
him
and
not
tarry
in
him
the
holy
ghost
a
personage
the
sign
of
the
dove
was
instituted
before
the
creation
of
the
world
a
witness
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
devil
can
not
come
in
the
sign
of
a
dove
the
holy
ghost
is
a
personage
and
is
in
the
form
of
a
personage
it
does
not
confine
itself
to
the
form
of
a
dove
but
in
the
sign
of
a
dove
the
holy
ghost
can
not
be
transformed
into
a
dove
but
the
sign
of
a
dove
was
given
to
john
to
signify
the
truth
of
the
deed
as
the
dove
is
an
emblem
or
token
of
truth
and
innocence
ignorance
as
to
the
character
of
god
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
have
an
understanding
of
god
himself
in
the
beginning
there
are
but
a
very
few
beings
in
the
world
who
understand
rightly
the
character
of
god
the
great
majority
of
mankind
do
not
comprehend
anything
either
that
which
is
passed
or
that
which
is
to
come
as
it
respects
their
relationship
to
god
they
do
not
know
neither
do
they
understand
the
nature
of
that
relationship
and
consequently
they
know
but
little
above
the
brute
beast
or
more
than
to
eat
drink
and
sleep
this
is
all
man
knows
about
god
or
his
existence
unless
it
is
given
by
the
inspiration
of
the
almighty
what
kind
of
a
being
god
is
i
want
to
ask
this
congregation
every
man
woman
and
child
to
answer
the
question
in
their
own
heart
what
kind
of
a
being
god
is
god
himself
was
once
as
we
are
now
and
is
an
exalted
man
and
sits
enthroned
in
yonder
heaven
that
is
the
great
secret
if
the
veil
was
rent
today
and
the
great
god
who
holds
this
world
in
its
orbit
and
who
upholds
all
worlds
and
all
things
by
his
power
was
to
make
himself
visible
i
say
if
you
were
to
see
him
today
you
would
see
him
like
a
man
in
form
like
yourselves
in
all
the
person
image
and
very
form
as
a
man
for
adam
was
created
in
the
very
fashion
image
and
likeness
of
god
and
received
instruction
from
and
walked
talked
and
conversed
with
him
as
one
man
talks
and
communes
with
another
it
is
the
first
principle
of
the
gospel
to
know
for
a
certainty
the
character
of
god
and
to
know
that
we
may
converse
with
him
as
one
man
converses
with
another
and
that
he
was
once
a
man
like
us
yea
that
god
himself
the
father
of
us
all
dwelt
on
an
earth
the
same
as
jesus
christ
himself
did
and
i
will
show
it
from
the
bible
plurality
of
gods
established
by
the
language
of
genesis
i
shall
comment
on
the
very
first
hebrew
word
in
the
bible
i
will
make
a
comment
on
the
very
first
sentence
of
the
history
of
creation
in
the
bible
i
want
to
analyze
the
word
in
by

and
everything
else

the
inspired
man
wrote
it
he
did
not
put
the
there
an
old
jew
without
any
authority
added
the
word
he
thought
it
too
bad
to
begin
to
talk
about
the
head
it
read
first
the
head
one
of
the
gods
brought
forth
the
gods
that
is
the
true
meaning
of
the
words
signifies
to
bring
forth
if
you
do
not
believe
it
you
do
not
believe
the
learned
man
of
god
learned
men
can
teach
you
no
more
than
what
i
have
told
you
thus
the
head
god
brought
forth
the
gods
in
the
grand
council
the
head
god
called
together
the
gods
and
sat
in
grand
council
to
bring
forth
the
world
the
grand
councilors
sat
at
the
head
in
yonder
heavens
and
contemplated
the
creation
of
the
worlds
which
were
created
at
that
time
in
the
beginning
the
head
of
the
gods
called
a
council
of
the
gods
and
they
came
together
and
concocted
a
plan
to
create
the
world
and
people
it
later
in
dwelling
on
the
same
subject
he
said
i
will
show
from
the
hebrew
bible
that
i
am
correct
and
the
first
word
shows
a
plurality
of
gods
and
i
want
the
apostates
and
learned
men
to
come
here
and
prove
to
the
contrary
if
they
can
an
unlearned
boy
must
give
you
a

translation
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
i
want
to
analyze
the
word
the
head
a
grammatical
termination
the
was
not
originally
put
there
when
the
inspired
man
wrote
it
but
it
has
been
since
added
by
an
old
jew
signifies
to
bring
forth
eloheim
is
from
the
word
god
in
the
singular
number
and
by
adding
the
word
it
renders
it
gods
it
read
first
in
the
beginning
the
head
of
the
gods
brought
forth
gods
or
as
others
have
translated
it
the
head
of
the
gods
called
the
gods
together
sustained
by
john
the
revelator
president
joseph
smith
read
the
third
chapter
of
revelations
and
took
for
his
text
first
chapter
sixth
verse
and
hath
made
us
kings
and
priests
unto
god
and
his
father
to
him
be
glory
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever
amen
it
is
altogether
correct
in
the
translation
now
you
know
that
of
late
some
malicious
and
corrupt
men
have
sprung
up
and
apostatized
from
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
and
they
declare
that
the
prophet
believes
in
a
plurality
of
gods
and
lo
and
behold
we
have
discovered
a
very
great
secret
they
cry
the
prophet
says
there
are
many
gods
and
this
proves
that
he
has
fallen
i
will
preach
on
the
plurality
of
gods
i
have
selected
this
text
for
that
express
purpose
i
wish
to
declare
i
have
always
and
in
all
congregations
when
i
have
preached
on
the
subject
of
the
deity
it
has
been
the
plurality
of
gods
it
has
been
preached
by
the
elders
fifteen
years
i
have
always
declared
god
to
be
a
distinct
personage
jesus
christ
a
separate
and
distinct
personage
from
god
the
father
and
the
holy
ghost
was
a
distinct
personage
and
a
spirit
and
these
three
constitute
three
distinct
personages
and
three
gods
if
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
new
testament
lo
and
behold
we
have
three
gods
anyhow
and
they
are
plural
and
who
can
contradict
it
by
the
testimony
of
paul
our
text
says
and
hath
made
us
kings
and
priests
unto
god
and
the
apostles
have
discovered
that
there
were
gods
above
for
paul
says
god
was
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
john
was
one
of
the
men
and
the
apostles
declare
they
were
made
kings
and
priests
unto
god
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
it
reads
just
so
in
the
revelation
hence
the
doctrine
of
a
plurality
of
gods
is
as
prominent
in
the
bible
as
any
other
doctrine
it
is
all
over
the
face
of
the
bible
it
stands
beyond
the
power
of
controversy
a
wayfaring
man
though
a
fool
need
not
err
therein
paul
says
there
are
gods
many
and
lords
many
i
want
to
set
it
forth
in
a
plain
and
simple
manner
but
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
that
is
to
us
and
he
is
in
all
and
through
all
but
if
joseph
smith
says
there
are
gods
many
and
lords
many
they
cry
away
with
him
and
crucify
him
crucify
him
mankind
verily
say
that
the
scriptures
are
with
them
search
the
scriptures
for
they
testify
of
things
that
these
apostates
would
gravely
pronounce
blasphemy
paul
if
joseph
smith
is
a
blasphemer
you
are
i
say
there
are
gods
many
and
lords
many
but
to
us
only
one
and
we
are
to
be
in
subjection
to
that
one
and
no
man
can
limit
the
bounds
or
the
eternal
existence
of
eternal
time
some
say
i
do
not
interpret
the
scriptures
the
same
as
they
do
they
say
it
means
the
heathen
gods
paul
says
there
are
gods
many
and
lords
many
and
that
makes
a
plurality
of
gods
in
spite
of
the
whims
of
all
men
without
a
revelation
i
am
not
going
to
give
them
the
knowledge
of
the
god
of
heaven
you
know
and
i
testify
that
paul
had
no
allusion
to
the
heathen
gods
i
have
it
from
god
and
get
over
it
if
you
can
i
have
a
witness
of
the
holy
ghost
and
a
testimony
that
paul
had
no
allusion
to
the
heathen
gods
in
the
text
by
the
philosophy
of
abraham
i
want
to
reason
a
little
on
this
subject
i
learned
it
by
translating
the
papyrus
which
is
now
in
my
house
i
learned
a
testimony
concerning
abraham
and
he
reasoned
concerning
the
god
of
heaven
in
order
to
do
that
said
he
suppose
we
have
two
facts
that
supposes
another
fact
may
exist
two
men
on
the
earth
one
wiser
than
the
other
would
logically
show
that
another
who
is
wiser
than
the
wiser
one
may
exist
intelligences
exist
one
above
another
so
that
there
is
no
end
to
them
if
abraham
reasoned
thus
if
jesus
christ
was
the
son
of
god
and
john
discovered
that
god
the
father
of
jesus
christ
had
a
father
you
may
suppose
that
he
had
a
father
also
where
was
there
ever
a
son
without
a
father
and
where
was
there
ever
a
father
without
first
being
a
son
whenever
did
a
tree
or
anything
spring
into
existence
without
a
progenitor
and
everything
comes
in
this
way
paul
says
that
which
is
earthly
is
in
the
likeness
of
that
which
is
heavenly
hence
if
jesus
had
a
father
can
we
not
believe
that
he
had
a
father
also
i
despise
the
idea
of
being
scared
to
death
at
such
doctrine
for
the
bible
is
full
of
it
by
the
testimony
of
jesus
i
believe
all
that
god
ever
revealed
and
i
never
hear
of
a
man
being
damned
for
believing
too
much
but
they
are
damned
for
unbelief
they
found
fault
with
jesus
christ
because
he
said
he
was
the
son
of
god
and
made
himself
equal
with
god
they
say
of
me
like
they
did
of
the
apostles
of
old
that
i
must
be
put
down
what
did
jesus
say
is
it
not
written
in
your
law
i
said
ye
are
gods
if
he
called
them
gods
unto
whom
the
word
of
god
came
and
the
scripture
can
not
be
broken
say
ye
of
him
whom
the
father
has
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
thou
blasphemest
because
i
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
it
was
through
him
that
they
drank
of
the
spiritual
rock
of
course
he
would
take
the
honor
himself
jesus
if
they
were
called
gods
unto
whom
the
word
of
god
came
why
should
it
be
thought
blasphemy
that
i
should
say
i
am
the
son
of
god
how
god
came
to
be
a
god
we
have
imagined
and
supposed
that
god
was
god
from
all
eternity
i
will
refute
that
idea
and
will
take
away
the
vail
so
that
you
may
see
the
scriptures
inform
us
that
jesus
said
as
the
father
hath
power
in
himself
even
so
hath
the
son
power
to
do
what
why
what
the
father
did
the
answer
is
obvious
in
a
manner
to
lay
down
his
body
and
take
it
up
again
jesus
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
lay
down
my
life
as
my
father
did
and
take
it
up
again
do
you
believe
it
if
you
do
not
believe
it
you
do
not
believe
the
bible
here
then
is
eternal
life
to
know
the
only
wise
and
true
god
and
you
have
got
to
learn
to
be
gods
yourselves
and
to
be
kings
and
priests
to
god
the
same
as
all
gods
have
done
before
you
namely
by
going
from
one
small
degree
to
another
and
from
a
small
capacity
to
a
great
one
from
grace
to
grace
from
exaltation
to
exaltation
until
you
attain
to
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
are
able
to
dwell
in
everlasting
burnings
and
to
sit
in
glory
as
do
those
who
sit
enthroned
in
everlasting
power
the
appointment
of
gods
the
scriptures
are
a
mixture
of
very
strange
doctrines
to
the
christian
world
who
are
blindly
led
by
the
blind
i
will
refer
to
another
scripture
now
says
god
when
he
visited
moses
in
the
bush
moses
was
a
stammering
sort
of
a
boy
like
me
god
said
thou
shalt
be
a
god
unto
the
children
of
israel
god
said
thou
shalt
be
a
god
unto
aaron
and
he
shall
be
thy
spokesman
i
believe
those
gods
that
god
reveals
as
gods
to
be
sons
of
gods
and
all
can
cry
abba
father
sons
of
god
who
exalt
themselves
to
be
gods
even
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
are
the
only
gods
i
have
a
reverence
for
the
appointment
of
our
god
the
head
of
the
gods
appointed
one
god
for
us
and
when
you
take
a
view
of
the
subject
it
sets
one
free
to
see
all
the
beauty
holiness
and
perfection
of
the
gods
all
i
want
is
to
get
the
simple
naked
truth
and
the
whole
truth
the
oneness
of
god
in
what
it
consists
many
men
say
there
is
one
god
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
are
only
one
god
i
say
that
is
a
strange
god
anyhow
three
in
one
and
one
in
three
it
is
a
curious
organization
father
i
pray
not
for
the
world
but
i
pray
for
them
which
thou
hast
given
me
holy
father
keep
through
thine
own
name
those
whom
thou
hast
given
me
that
they
may
be
one
as
we
are
i
want
to
read
the
text
to
you
myself
i
am
agreed
with
the
father
and
the
father
is
agreed
with
me
and
we
are
agreed
as
one
the
greek
shows
that
it
should
be
agreed
father
i
pray
for
them
which
thou
hast
given
me
out
of
the
world
and
not
for
these
alone
but
for
them
also
which
shall
believe
on
me
through
their
word
that
they
all
may
be
agreed
as
thou
father
art
agreed
with
me
and
i
with
thee
that
they
also
may
be
agreed
with
us
and
all
come
to
dwell
in
unity
and
in
all
glory
and
everlasting
burnings
of
the
gods
and
then
we
shall
see
as
we
are
seen
and
be
as
our
god
and
he
as
his
father
of
man
and
his
immortality
the
doctrines
which
joseph
smith
taught
respecting
god
were
also
calculated
to
have
an
effect
on
his
teachings
respecting
man
and
that
it
did
so
is
evident
from
the
following
i
have
another
subject
to
dwell
upon
which
is
calculated
to
exalt
man
it
is
associated
with
the
subject
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
namely
the
soul
the
mind
of
man
the
immortal
spirit
where
did
it
come
from
all
learned
men
and
doctors
of
divinity
say
that
god
created
it
in
the
beginning
but
it
is
not
so
the
very
idea
lessens
man
in
my
estimation
i
do
not
believe
the
doctrine
i
know
better
hear
it
all
ye
ends
of
the
world
for
god
has
told
me
so
if
you
do
believe
me
it
will
not
make
the
truth
without
effect
we
say
that
god
himself
is
a
being
who
told
you
so
it
is
correct
enough
but
how
did
it
get
into
your
heads
who
told
you
that
man
did
not
exist
in
like
manner
upon
the
same
principles
god
made
a
tabernacle
and
put
a
spirit
into
it
and
it
became
a
living
soul
refers
to
the
old
bible
how
does
it
read
in
the
hebrew
it
does
not
say
in
hebrew
that
god
created
the
spirit
of
man
it
says
god
made
man
out
of
earth
and
put
into
him
adam
spirit
and
so
became
a
living
body
i
am
dwelling
on
the
immortality
of
the
spirit
of
man
is
it
logical
to
say
that
the
intelligence
of
spirits
is
immortal
and
yet
that
it
had
a
beginning
the
intelligence
of
spirits
had
no
beginning
neither
will
it
have
an
end
that
is
good
logic
that
which
has
a
beginning
may
have
an
end
there
never
was
a
time
when
there
were
not
spirits
for
they
are
with
our
father
in
heaven
the
prophet
views
on
immateriality
and
on
creation
there
is
no
such
thing
as
immaterial
matter
all
spirit
is
matter
but
it
is
more
fine
or
pure
and
can
only
be
discerned
by
purer
eyes
we
can
not
see
it
but
when
our
bodies
are
purified
we
shall
see
that
it
is
all
matter
you
ask
the
wise
doctors
why
they
say
the
world
was
made
out
of
nothing
and
they
will
answer
do
the
bible
say
he
created
the
world
and
they
infer
from
that
word
that
it
must
be
made
out
of
nothing
now
the
word
create
came
from
the
word
which
does
not
mean
to
create
out
of
nothing
it
means
to
organize
the
same
as
man
would
organize
material
and
build
a
ship
hence
we
infer
that
god
had
materials
to
organize
the
world
out
of
chaos
chaotic
matter
which
is
element
and
in
which
dwells
all
the
glory
elements
had
an
existence
from
the
time
he
god
had
the
pure
principles
of
elements
can
never
be
destroyed
they
may
be
organized
and
reorganized
but
not
destroyed
they
had
no
beginning
and
can
have
no
end
in
order
to
present
a
more
complete
view
of
the
importance
of
man
as
connected
with
the
work
of
his
redemption
his
future
exaltation
and
glory
as
taught
by
the
prophet
i
quote
two
discourses
of
his
preached
in
nauvoo
some
time
previous
to
the
period
under
consideration
the
first
is
an
excerpt
from
remarks
of
the
prophet
made
in
reply
to
certain
questions
about
the
priesthood
and
other
subjects
the
second
is
from
an
article
presented
by
him
at
the
october
conference
of
i
the
priesthood
was
first
given
to
adam
he
obtained
the
first
presidency
and
held
the
keys
of
it
from
generation
to
generation
he
obtained
it
in
the
creation
before
the
world
was
formed
as
in
he
had
dominion
given
him
over
every
living
creature
he
is
michael
the
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
then
to
noah
who
is
gabriel
he
stands
next
in
authority
to
adam
in
the
priesthood
he
was
called
of
god
to
this
office
and
was
the
father
of
all
living
in
his
day
and
to
him
was
given
the
dominion
these
men
held
keys
first
on
earth
and
then
in
heaven
the
priesthood
is
an
everlasting
principle
and
existed
with
god
from
eternity
and
will
to
eternity
without
beginning
of
days
or
end
of
years
the
keys
have
to
be
brought
from
heaven
whenever
the
gospel
is
sent
when
they
are
revealed
from
heaven
it
is
by
adam
authority
daniel
vii
speaks
of
the
ancient
of
days
he
means
the
oldest
man
our
father
adam
michael
he
will
call
his
children
together
and
hold
a
council
with
them
to
prepare
them
for
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
he
adam
is
the
father
of
the
human
family
and
presides
over
the
spirits
of
all
men
and
all
that
have
had
the
keys
must
stand
before
him
in
this
grand
council
this
may
take
place
before
some
of
us
leave
this
stage
of
action
the
son
of
man
stands
before
him
and
there
is
given
him
glory
and
dominion
adam
delivers
up
his
stewardship
to
christ
that
which
was
delivered
to
him
as
holding
the
keys
of
the
universe
but
retains
his
standing
as
head
of
the
human
family
the
spirit
of
man
is
not
a
created
being
it
existed
from
eternity
and
will
exist
to
eternity
anything
created
can
not
be
eternal
and
earth
water
had
their
existence
in
an
elementary
state
from
eternity
our
savior
speaks
of
children
and
says
their
angels
always
stand
before
my
father
the
father
called
all
spirits
before
him
at
the
creation
of
man
and
organized
them
he
adam
is
the
head
and
was
told
to
multiply
the
keys
were
first
given
to
him
and
by
him
to
others
he
will
have
to
give
an
account
of
his
stewardship
and
they
to
him
the
priesthood
is
everlasting
the
savior
moses
and
elias
gave
the
keys
to
peter
james
and
john
on
the
mount
when
he
was
transfigured
before
them
the
priesthood
is
everlasting
without
beginning
of
days
or
end
of
years
without
father
mother
if
there
is
no
change
of
ordinances
there
is
no
change
of
priesthood
wherever
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
are
administered
there
is
the
priesthood
how
have
we
come
at
the
priesthood
in
the
last
days
it
came
down
in
regular
succession
peter
james
and
john
had
it
given
to
them
and
they
gave
it
to
others
christ
is
the
great
high
priest
adam
next
paul
speaks
of
the
church
coming
to
an
innumerable
company
of
angels
to
god
the
judge
of
all
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
to
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
heb
iii
i
saw
adam
in
the
valley
of
he
called
together
his
children
and
blessed
them
with
a
patriarchal
blessing
the
lord
appeared
in
their
midst
and
he
adam
blessed
them
all
and
foretold
what
should
befall
them
to
the
latest
generation
see
sec
iii
pars
this
is
why
abraham
blessed
his
posterity
he
wanted
to
bring
them
into
the
presence
of
god
they
looked
for
a
city
moses
sought
to
bring
the
children
of
israel
into
the
presence
of
god
through
the
power
of
the
priesthood
but
he
could
not
in
the
first
ages
of
the
world
they
tried
to
establish
the
same
thing
and
there
were
eliases
raised
up
who
tried
to
restore
these
very
glories
but
did
not
obtain
them
but
they
prophesied
of
a
day
when
this
glory
would
be
revealed
paul
spoke
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
when
god
would
gather
together
all
things
in
one
and
those
men
to
whom
these
keys
have
been
given
will
have
to
be
there
and
they
without
us
can
not
be
made
perfect
these
men
are
in
heaven
but
their
children
are
on
earth
their
bowels
yearn
over
us
god
sends
down
men
for
this
reason
matt
xiii
and
the
son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
angels
all
these
authoritative
characters
will
come
down
and
join
hand
in
hand
in
bringing
about
this
work
ii
in
order
to
investigate
the
subject
of
the
priesthood
so
important
to
this
as
well
as
every
succeeding
generation
i
shall
proceed
to
trace
the
subject
as
far
as
i
possibly
can
from
the
old
and
new
testaments
there
are
two
priesthoods
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
the
melchisedek
and
the
aaronic
or
levitical
although
there
are
two
priesthoods
yet
the
melchisedek
priesthood
comprehends
the
aaronic
or
levitical
priesthood
and
is
the
grand
head
and
holds
the
highest
authority
which
pertains
to
the
priesthood
and
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
all
ages
of
the
world
to
the
latest
posterity
on
the
earth
and
is
the
channel
through
which
all
knowledge
doctrine
the
plan
of
salvation
and
every
important
matter
is
revealed
from
heaven
its
institution
was
prior
to
the
foundation
of
this
earth
or
the
morning
stars
sang
together
or
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
and
is
the
highest
and
holiest
priesthood
and
is
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
and
all
other
priesthoods
are
only
parts
ramifications
powers
and
blessings
belonging
to
the
same
and
are
held
controlled
and
directed
by
it
it
is
the
channel
through
which
the
almighty
commenced
revealing
his
glory
at
the
beginning
of
the
creation
of
this
earth
and
through
which
he
has
continued
to
reveal
himself
to
the
children
of
men
to
the
present
time
and
through
which
he
will
make
known
his
purposes
to
the
end
of
time
commencing
with
adam
who
was
the
first
man
who
is
spoken
of
in
daniel
as
being
the
ancient
of
days
or
in
other
words
the
first
and
oldest
of
all
the
great
grand
progenitor
of
whom
it
is
said
in
another
place
he
is
michael
because
he
was
the
first
and
father
of
all
not
only
by
progeny
but
the
first
to
hold
the
spiritual
blessings
to
whom
was
made
known
the
plan
of
ordinances
for
the
salvation
of
his
posterity
unto
the
end
and
to
whom
christ
was
first
revealed
and
through
whom
christ
has
been
revealed
from
heaven
and
will
continue
to
be
revealed
from
henceforth
adam
holds
the
keys
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
the
dispensation
of
all
the
times
have
been
and
will
be
revealed
through
him
from
the
beginning
to
christ
and
from
christ
to
the
end
of
all
the
dispensations
that
are
to
be
revealed
ephesians
and
verses
having
made
known
unto
us
the
mystery
of
his
will
according
to
his
good
pleasure
which
he
has
purposed
in
himself
that
in
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
he
might
gather
together
in
one
all
things
in
christ
both
which
are
in
heaven
and
which
are
on
earth
in
him
now
the
purpose
in
himself
in
the
winding
up
scene
of
the
last
dispensation
is
that
all
things
pertaining
to
that
dispensation
should
be
conducted
precisely
in
accordance
with
the
preceding
dispensations
and
again
god
purposed
in
himself
that
there
should
not
be
eternal
fullness
until
every
dispensation
should
be
fulfilled
and
gathered
together
in
one
and
that
all
things
whatsoever
that
should
be
gathered
together
in
one
in
those
dispensations
unto
the
same
fullness
and
eternal
glory
should
be
in
christ
jesus
therefore
he
set
the
ordinances
to
be
the
same
forever
and
set
adam
to
watch
over
them
to
reveal
them
from
heaven
to
man
or
to
send
angels
to
reveal
them
hebrews
i
are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits
sent
forth
to
minister
to
those
who
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation
these
angels
are
under
the
direction
of
michael
or
adam
who
acts
under
the
direction
of
the
lord
from
the
above
quotation
we
learn
that
paul
perfectly
understood
the
purposes
of
god
in
relation
to
his
connection
with
man
and
that
glorious
and
perfect
order
which
he
established
in
himself
whereby
he
sent
forth
power
revelations
and
glory
god
will
not
acknowledge
that
which
he
has
not
called
ordained
and
chosen
in
the
beginning
god
called
adam
by
his
own
voice
see
genesis
chapter
and
the
lord
called
unto
adam
and
said
unto
him
where
art
thou
and
he
said
i
heard
thy
voice
in
the
garden
and
i
was
afraid
because
i
was
naked
and
hid
myself
adam
received
commandments
and
instruction
from
god
this
was
the
order
from
the
beginning
that
he
received
revelations
commandments
and
ordinances
at
the
beginning
is
beyond
the
power
of
controversy
else
how
did
they
begin
to
offer
sacrifices
to
god
in
an
acceptable
manner
and
if
they
offered
sacrifices
they
must
be
authorized
by
ordination
we
read
in
that
abel
brought
of
the
firstlings
of
the
flock
and
the
fat
thereof
and
the
lord
had
respect
to
abel
and
to
his
offering
and
again
hebrews
xi
by
faith
abel
offered
unto
god
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
than
cain
by
which
he
obtained
witness
that
he
was
righteous
god
testifying
of
his
gifts
and
by
it
he
being
dead
yet
speaketh
how
doth
he
yet
speak
why
he
magnified
the
priesthood
which
was
conferred
upon
him
and
died
a
righteous
man
and
therefore
has
become
an
angel
of
god
by
receiving
his
body
from
the
dead
holding
still
the
keys
of
his
dispensation
and
was
sent
down
from
heaven
unto
paul
to
minister
consoling
words
and
to
commit
unto
him
a
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
of
godliness
and
if
this
was
not
the
case
i
would
ask
how
did
paul
know
so
much
about
abel
and
why
should
he
talk
about
his
speaking
after
he
was
dead
hence
that
he
spoke
after
he
was
dead
must
be
by
being
sent
down
out
of
heaven
to
administer
this
then
is
the
nature
of
the
priesthood
every
man
holding
the
presidency
of
his
dispensation
and
one
man
holding
the
presidency
of
them
all
even
adam
and
adam
receiving
his
presidency
and
authority
from
the
lord
but
can
not
receive
a
fullness
until
christ
shall
present
the
kingdom
to
the
father
which
shall
be
at
the
end
of
the
last
dispensation
footnotes
genesis
i
i
i
think
in
this
last
sentence
the
report
is
imperfect
the
prophet
doubtless
meant
to
represent
jesus
as
still
talking
that
is
as
if
the
prophet
had
said
continues
if
they
were
called
etc
chapter
xxx
doctrinal
development
at
nauvoo
miscellaneous
items
in
this
chapter
i
quote
the
sayings
and
instructions
of
the
prophet
on
a
variety
of
topics
uttered
principally
within
the
period
under
consideration
from
january
to
june
though
there
are
some
exceptions
the
various
kinds
of
beings
in
heaven
there
are
two
kinds
of
beings
in
heaven
viz
angels
who
are
resurrected
personages
having
bodies
of
flesh
and
bones
for
instance
jesus
said
handle
me
and
see
for
a
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
bones
as
you
see
me
have
second
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
they
who
are
not
resurrected
but
inherit
the
same
glory
how
to
determine
the
nature
of
an
administration
when
a
messenger
comes
saying
he
has
a
message
from
god
offer
him
your
hand
and
request
him
to
shake
hands
with
you
if
he
be
an
angel
he
will
do
so
and
you
will
feel
his
hand
if
he
be
the
spirit
of
a
just
man
made
perfect
he
will
come
in
his
glory
for
that
is
the
only
way
he
can
appear
ask
him
to
shake
hands
with
you
but
he
will
not
move
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
order
of
heaven
for
a
just
man
to
deceive
but
he
will
still
deliver
his
message
if
it
be
the
devil
as
an
angel
of
light
when
you
ask
him
to
shake
hands
he
will
offer
you
his
hand
but
you
will
not
feel
anything
you
may
therefore
detect
him
these
are
three
grand
keys
whereby
you
may
know
whether
or
not
any
administration
is
from
god
the
prophet
view
on
the
creeds
of
men
i
can
not
believe
in
any
of
the
creeds
of
the
different
denominations
because
they
all
have
some
things
in
them
i
can
not
subscribe
to
though
all
of
them
have
some
truth
i
want
to
come
up
in
the
presence
of
god
and
learn
all
things
but
the
creeds
set
up
stakes
and
say
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
and
no
further
which
i
can
not
subscribe
to
the
prophet
on
friendship
friendship
is
one
of
the
grand
fundamental
principles
of
mormonism
to
revolutionize
and
civilize
the
world
and
cause
wars
and
contentions
to
cease
and
men
to
become
friends
and
brothers
even
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
shall
dwell
together
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
the
calf
and
young
lion
and
the
fatling
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
the
bear
and
the
cow
shall
lie
down
together
and
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp
and
the
weaned
child
shall
play
on
the
cockatrice
den
and
they
shall
not
hurt
or
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
it
is
a
adage
that
love
begets
love
let
us
pour
forth
love
show
forth
all
kindness
unto
all
mankind
and
the
lord
will
reward
us
with
everlasting
increase
cast
our
bread
upon
the
waters
and
we
shall
receive
it
after
many
days
increased
to
a
hundredfold
on
the
power
of
the
word
of
god
every
word
that
proceedeth
from
the
mouth
of
jehovah
has
such
an
influence
over
the
human
mind
the
logical
mind
that
it
is
convincing
without
other
testimony
faith
cometh
by
hearing
if
ten
thousand
men
testify
to
a
truth
you
know
would
it
add
to
your
faith
no
or
will
ten
thousand
testimonies
destroy
your
knowledge
of
a
fact
no
i
do
want
any
one
to
tell
me
i
am
a
prophet
or
attempt
to
prove
my
word
the
prophet
on
the
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
is
one
of
the
first
principles
of
my
life
and
one
that
i
have
cultivated
from
my
childhood
having
been
taught
it
by
my
father
to
allow
every
one
the
liberty
of
conscience
i
am
the
greatest
advocate
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
there
is
on
the
earth
in
my
feelings
i
am
always
ready
to
die
in
the
protection
of
the
weak
and
oppressed
in
their
just
rights
the
only
fault
i
find
with
the
constitution
is
it
is
not
broad
enough
to
cover
the
whole
ground
although
it
provides
that
all
men
shall
enjoy
religious
freedom
yet
it
does
not
provide
the
manner
in
which
that
freedom
can
be
preserved
nor
for
the
punishment
of
government
officers
who
refuse
to
protect
the
people
in
their
religious
rights
or
punish
those
mobs
states
or
communities
who
interfere
with
the
rights
of
people
on
account
of
their
religion
its
sentiments
are
good
but
it
provides
no
means
of
enforcing
them
it
has
but
this
one
fault
under
its
provision
a
man
or
people
who
are
able
to
protect
themselves
can
get
along
well
enough
but
those
who
have
the
misfortune
to
be
weak
or
unpopular
are
left
to
the
merciless
rage
of
popular
fury
the
constitution
should
contain
a
provision
that
every
officer
of
the
government
who
should
neglect
or
refuse
to
extend
the
protection
guaranteed
in
the
constitution
should
be
subject
to
capital
punishment
and
then
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
not
say
your
cause
is
just
but
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
governors
issue
exterminating
orders
or
judges
say
the
men
ought
to
have
the
protection
of
law
but
it
wo
please
the
mob
the
men
must
die
anyhow
to
satisfy
the
clamor
of
the
rabble
they
must
be
hung
or
missouri
be
damned
to
all
eternity
executive
writs
could
be
issued
when
they
ought
to
be
and
not
be
made
instruments
of
cruelty
to
oppress
the
innocent
and
persecute
men
whose
religion
is
unpopular
the
prophet
comment
on
good
men
i
do
not
think
there
have
been
many
good
men
on
the
earth
since
the
days
of
adam
but
there
was
one
good
man
and
his
name
was
jesus
many
persons
think
a
prophet
must
be
a
great
deal
better
than
anybody
else
suppose
i
would
condescend
yes
i
will
call
it
condescend
to
be
a
great
deal
better
than
any
of
you
i
would
be
raised
up
to
the
highest
heavens
and
who
should
i
have
to
accompany
me
i
love
that
man
better
who
swears
a
stream
as
long
as
my
arm
yet
deals
justice
to
his
neighbors
and
mercifully
deals
his
substance
to
the
poor
than
the
long
hypocrite
i
do
not
want
you
to
think
i
am
very
righteous
for
i
am
not
god
judges
men
according
to
the
use
they
make
of
the
light
which
he
gives
them
the
prophet
estimate
and
description
of
himself
i
am
like
a
huge
rough
stone
rolling
down
from
a
high
mountain
and
the
only
polishing
i
get
is
when
some
corner
gets
rubbed
off
by
coming
in
contact
with
something
else
striking
with

force
against
religious
bigotry

suborned

corner
there

i
will
become

and
polished
shaft
in
the
quiver
of
the
almighty
who
will
give
me
dominion
over
all
and

am

rough
stone
the
sound
of

hammer

was
never
heard
on
me
until
the
lord
took
me
in
hand
i
desire
the
learning
and
wisdom
of
heaven
alone
i
have
not
the
least
idea
if
christ
should
come
to
the
earth
and
preach
such
rough
things
as
he
preached
to
the
jews
but
that
this
generation
would
reject
him
for
being
so
rough

worlds
than
ours

and

which
is

on

as
are
in

all
that
are
in

saying

and

and

be
unto
him

sitteth
upon

and
ever
the
prophet
said
i
suppose
john
saw
beings
there
of
a
thousand
forms
that
had
been
saved
from
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
earths
like
this
strange
beasts
of
which
we
have
no
conception
all
might
be
seen
in
heaven
the
grand
secret
was
to
show
john
what
there
was
in
heaven
john
learned
that
god
glorified
himself
by
saving
all
that
his
hands
had
made
whether
beasts
fowls
fishes
or
men
and
he
will
gratify
himself
with
them
the
prophet
definition
of
the
word
mormon
before
i
give
a
definition
however
to
the
word
mormon
let
me
say
that
the
bible
in
its
widest
sense
means
good
for
the
savior
says
according
to
the
gospel
of
john
i
am
the
good
shepherd
and
it
will
not
be
beyond
the
common
use
of
terms
to
say
that
good
is
among
the
most
important
in
use
and
though
known
by
various
names
in
different
languages
still
its
meaning
is
the
same
and
is
ever
in
opposition
to
bad
we
say
from
the
saxon
good
the
dane
god
the
goth
goda
the
german
gut
the
dutch
goed
the
latin
bonus
the
greek
kalos
the
hebrew
tob
and
the
egyptian
mon
hence
with
the
addition
of
more
or
the
contraction
mor
we
have
the
word
mormon
which
means
literally
more
good
make
your
calling
and
election
sure
commenting
on
ii
peter
i
and
also
verse
the
prophet
said
now
there
is
some
grand
secret
here
and
keys
to
unlock
the
subject
notwithstanding
the
apostle
exhorts
them
to
add
to
their
faith
virtue
temperance
yet
he
exhorts
them
to
make
their
calling
and
election
sure
and
though
they
had
heard
an
audible
voice
from
heaven
bearing
testimony
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
yet
he
says
we
have
a
more
sure
word
of
prophecy
whereunto
ye
do
well
that
ye
take
heed
as
unto
a
light
shining
in
a
dark
place
now
wherein
could
they
have
a
more
sure
word
of
prophecy
than
to
hear
the
voice
of
god
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
etc
now
for
the
secret
and
grand
key
though
they
might
hear
the
voice
of
god
and
know
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
this
would
be
no
evidence
that
their
election
and
calling
was
made
sure
that
they
had
part
with
christ
and
were
joint
heirs
with
him
they
then
would
want
that
more
sure
word
of
prophecy
that
they
were
sealed
in
the
heavens
and
had
the
promise
of
eternal
life
in
the
kingdom
of
god
then
having
this
promise
sealed
unto
them
it
was
an
anchor
to
the
soul
sure
and
steadfast
though
the
thunder
might
roll
and
the
lightning
flash
and
earthquakes
bellow
and
war
gather
thick
around
yet
this
hope
and
knowledge
would
support
the
soul
in
every
hour
of
trial
trouble
and
tribulation
then
knowledge
through
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
is
the
grand
key
that
unlocks
the
glories
and
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
value
of
aged
men
in
council
the
way
to
get
along
in
any
important
matter
is
to
gather
unto
yourself
wise
men
experienced
and
aged
men
to
assist
in
council
in
all
times
of
trouble
handsome
men
are
not
apt
to
be
wise
and
but
the
strength
of
a
man
will
generally
create
coarse
features
like
the
rough
strong
bough
of
the
oak
you
will
always
discover
in
the
first
glance
of
a
man
in
the
outline
of
his
features
something
of
his
mind
salvation
in
what
it
consists
salvation
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
triumph
over
all
our
enemies
and
put
them
under
our
feet
and
when
we
have
power
to
put
all
enemies
under
our
feet
in
this
world
and
a
knowledge
to
triumph
over
all
evil
spirits
in
the
world
to
come
then
we
are
saved
as
in
the
case
of
jesus
who
was
to
reign
until
he
had
put
all
enemies
under
his
feet
and
the
last
enemy
was
death
desirability
of
possessing
earthly
tabernacles
now
in
this
world
mankind
are
naturally
selfish
ambitious
and
striving
to
excel
one
above
another
yet
some
are
willing
to
build
up
others
as
well
as
themselves
so
in
the
other
world
there
are
a
variety
of
spirits
some
seek
to
excel
and
this
was
the
case
with
lucifer
when
he
fell
he
sought
for
things
which
were
unlawful
hence
he
was
cast
down
and
it
is
said
he
drew
away
many
with
him
and
the
greatness
of
his
punishment
is
that
he
shall
not
have
a
tabernacle
this
is
his
punishment
so
the
devil
thinking
to
thwart
the
decree
of
god
by
going
up
and
down
in
the
earth
seeking
whom
he
may
destroy
any
person
that
he
can
find
that
will
yield
to
him
he
will
bind
him
and
take
possession
of
the
body
and
reign
there
glorying
in
it
mightily
not
thinking
that
he
had
gotten
a
stolen
tabernacle
and
by
and
by
some
one
having
authority
will
come
along
and
cast
him
out
and
restore
the
tabernacle
to
its
rightful
owner
but
the
devil
steals
a
tabernacle
because
he
has
not
one
of
his
own
but
if
he
steals
one
he
is
always
liable
to
be
turned
out
of
doors
of
the
spirits
in
prison
i
will
say
something
about
the
spirits
in
prison
there
has
been
much
said
by
modern
divines
about
the
words
of
jesus
when
on
the
cross
to
the
thief
saying
this
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
king
james
translation
makes
it
out
to
say
paradise
but
what
is
paradise
it
is
a
modern
word
it
does
not
answer
at
all
to
the
original
word
that
jesus
made
use
of
find
the
original
of
the
word
paradise
you
may
as
easily
find
a
needle
in
a
haymow
here
is
a
chance
for
battle
ye
learned
men
there
is
nothing
in
the
original
word
in
greek
from
which
this
was
taken
that
signifies
paradise
but
it
was
this
day
thou
shalt
be
with
me
in
the
world
of
spirits
then
i
will
teach
you
all
about
it
and
answer
your
inquiries
and
peter
says
he
went
out
and
preached
to
the
world
of
spirits
spirits
in
prison
peter
chapter
verse
so
that
they
who
would
receive
it
could
have
it
answered
by
proxy
by
those
who
live
on
the
earth
hades
the
greek
or
sheol
the
hebrew
these
two
significations
means
a
world
of
spirits
hades
sheol
paradise
spirits
in
prison
are
all
one
it
is
a
world
of
spirits
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
will
go
to
the
same
world
of
spirits
until
the
resurrection
i
do
not
think
so
says
one
if
you
will
go
to
my
house
any
time
i
will
take
my
lexicon
and
prove
it
to
you
the
great
misery
of
departed
spirits
in
the
world
of
spirits
where
they
go
after
death
is
to
know
that
they
come
short
of
the
glory
that
others
enjoy
and
that
they
might
have
enjoyed
themselves
and
they
are
their
own
accusers
the
persistence
of
obtained
intelligence
whatever
principle
of
intelligence
we
attain
unto
in
this
life
it
will
rise
with
us
in
the
resurrection
and
if
a
person
gains
more
knowledge
and
intelligence
in
this
life
through
his
diligence
and
obedience
than
another
he
will
have
so
much
the
advantage
in
the
world
to
come
there
is
a
law
irrevocably
decreed
in
heaven
before
the
foundation
of
this
world
upon
which
all
blessings
are
predicated
and
when
we
obtain
any
blessing
from
god
it
is
by
obedience
to
that
law
upon
which
it
is
predicated
the
desirability
and
power
of
knowledge
if
we
get
puffed
up
by
thinking
that
we
have
much
knowledge
we
are
apt
to
get
a
contentious
spirit
and
correct
knowledge
is
necessary
to
cast
out
that
spirit
the
evil
of
being
puffed
up
with
correct
though
useless
knowledge
is
not
so
great
as
the
evil
of
contention
knowledge
does
away
with
darkness
suspense
and
doubt
for
these
can
not
exist
where
knowledge
is
in
knowledge
there
is
power
god
has
more
power
than
all
other
beings
because
he
has
greater
knowledge
and
hence
he
knows
how
to
subject
all
other
beings
to
him
he
has
power
over
all
it
is
not
wisdom
that
we
shall
have
all
knowledge
at
once
presented
before
us
but
that
we
should
have
a
little
at
a
time
then
we
can
comprehend
it
add
to
your
faith
knowledge
etc
the
principle
of
knowledge
is
the
principle
of
salvation
this
principle
can
be
comprehended
by
the
faithful
and
diligent
and
every
one
that
does
not
obtain
knowledge
sufficient
to
be
saved
will
be
condemned
the
principle
of
salvation
is
given
us
through
the
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
chapter
xxxi
the
prophet
arrested
on
missouri
old
charges
if
it
should
be
asked
what
class
of
men
can
do
the
state
the
most
harm
or
the
church
most
mischief
the
universal
answer
would
be
so
patent
is
the
correctness
of
the
statement
that
we
deem
it
unnecessary
to
inquire
into
the
reasons
that
lead
to
the
conclusion
what
state
has
perished
but
by
traitor
hands
what
patriot
suffered
but
by
a
traitor
perfidy
and
so
as
we
proceed
we
shall
see
that
it
was
principally
through
the
schemes
of
traitors
that
nauvoo
budding
prospects
were
blighted
and
her
virtuous
people
driven
into
the
wilderness
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
a
former
chapter
a
letter
written
by
john
bennett
to
sidney
rigdon
and
orson
pratt
is
reproduced
in
which
he
stated
that
he
was
then
for
missouri
for
the
purpose
of
getting
out
an
indictment
against
joseph
for
treason
against
that
state
said
to
have
been
committed
during
the
troubles
at
far
west
in
the
fall
of
whether
bennett
went
to
missouri
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
through
his
influence
the
old
charge
of
treason
was
revived
and
an
indictment
found
at
a
special
term
of
the
circuit
court
for
daviess
county
missouri
on
the
fifth
of
june
and
on
the
thirteenth
of
the
same
month
governor
reynolds
issued
a
requisition
on
the
governor
of
illinois
for
joseph
smith
and
appointed
joseph
reynolds
the
agent
of
missouri
to
receive
the
prophet
from
the
authorities
of
illinois
accordingly
the
warrant
for
the
arrest
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
harmon
wilson
by
governor
ford
of
illinois
and
wilson
and
reynolds
started
to
find
the
prophet
in
the
meantime
joseph
friends
were
not
inactive
the
day
before
governor
ford
issued
the
warrant
for
the
apprehension
of
the
prophet
he
incidentally
mentioned
to
judge
james
adams
that
a
requisition
had
been
made
by
missouri
for
the
arrest
of
joseph
and
that
he
should
issue
it
the
next
day
judge
adams
dispatched
an
express
from
springfield
to
nauvoo
with
this
information
the
express
arrived
in
nauvoo
on
the
sixteenth
of
june
but
three
days
before
joseph
with
emma
had
left
nauvoo
to
visit
emma
sister
a
wasson
living
near
dixon
in
lee
county
a
little
more
than
two
hundred
miles
north
of
nauvoo
on
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
from
judge
adams
hyrum
smith
at
once
dispatched
stephen
markham
and
william
clayton
to
joseph
with
the
information
they
left
nauvoo
about
midnight
of
the
eighteenth
and
hours
later
arrived
at
wasson
having
ridden
two
hundred
and
twelve
miles
in
that
time
changing
horses
only
once
and
that
near
the
end
of
the
journey
shortly
after
the
arrival
of
clayton
a
southwick
of
dixon
rode
out
to
inlet
grove
where
wasson
lived
to
inform
joseph
that
a
writ
was
out
for
him
and
for
his
pains
and
interest
the
prophet
paid
him
dollars
though
he
had
already
been
informed
by
clayton
and
markham
after
the
receipt
of
this
information
however
joseph
concluded
to
remain
where
he
was
for
if
he
started
for
home
he
might
meet
the
officers
where
he
had
no
friends
and
be
run
over
into
missouri
among
his
enemies
just
how
the
officers
wilson
and
reynolds
came
to
know
of
the
whereabouts
of
joseph
is
not
known
but
at
any
rate
they
went
directly
to
dixon
nearly
killing
their
horses
by
hard
driving
at
the
village
of
dixon
they
represented
themselves
as
mormon
elders
wanting
to
see
the
prophet
they
succeeded
in
hiring
a
man
with
a
team
to
drive
them
out
to
wasson
on
the
way
they
passed
william
clayton
who
had
been
sent
by
joseph
to
see
if
he
could
learn
anything
of
the
movements
of
the
officers
at
dixon
but
as
the
sheriffs
were
disguised
clayton
did
not
recognize
them
the
officers
arrived
at
wasson
and
found
joseph
walking
down
the
path
leading
to
the
barn
they
sprang
upon
him
like
wild
beasts
upon
their
prey
presenting
their
pistols
and
reynolds
exclaimed
g
d
you
sir
if
you
stir
i
shoot
and
this
with
slight
variations
he
kept
repeating
joseph
asked
them
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
for
they
attempted
to
serve
no
process
and
to
their
threats
of
violence
which
they
sought
to
make
emphatic
with
oaths
the
prophet
bared
his
breast
and
told
them
to
shoot
if
they
desired
to
for
he
had
endured
so
much
oppression
that
he
was
weary
of
life
by
this
time
stephen
markham
arrived
on
the
scene
and
immediately
started
to
the
prophet
assistance
despite
the
threats
of
the
officers
to
shoot
him
if
he
advanced
another
step
nor
did
the
brave
man
check
his
advance
until
joseph
cautioned
him
not
to
resist
the
officers
of
the
law
reynolds
and
wilson
with
much
rudeness
and
many
unnecessary
imprecations
hustled
their
prisoner
into
the
wagon
they
had
hired
in
dixon
and
were
for
starting
off
without
giving
the
prisoner
a
chance
to
say
one
word
to
his
friends
bid
his
wife
or
children
or
even
get
his
hat
and
coat
but
markham
regardless
of
the
threats
of
the
officers
to
shoot
him
seized
the
team
by
the
bits
and
said
there
was
no
law
requiring
an
officer
to
take
a
man
to
prison
without
his
clothes
and
held
on
until
emma
could
bring
out
joseph
hat
and
coat
all
this
time
they
had
served
no
process
on
their
prisoner
and
had
repeatedly
thrust
the
muzzles
of
their
pistols
against
his
sides
until
he
was
badly
bruised
by
the
violence
joseph
shouted
to
markham
as
he
was
driven
away
to
go
to
dixon
and
obtain
a
writ
of
but
as
the
horse
markham
rode
was
jaded
and
the
officers
ordered
their
driver
to
whip
up
they
kept
up
with
him
and
both
parties
went
into
the
town
together
the
sheriffs
thrust
their
prisoner
into
a
room
in
a
tavern
kept
by
mckennie
and
ordered
fresh
horses
to
be
ready
in
five
minutes
joseph

out
for
him
came
to
the
house
but
only
to
have
the
door
slammed
in
his
face
and
be
denied
admittance
another
lawyer
shepherd
patrick
tried
to
gain
admission
to
the
prisoner
but
met
with
the
same
treatment
as
the
first
but
at
last
through
the
influence
of
a
sanger
and
a
dixon
owner
of
the
hotel
building
where
the
prophet
was
detained
a
prisoner
reynolds
was
given
to
understand
that
his
prisoner
must
have
a
fair
trial
and
all
the
protection
the
laws
afforded
him
a
writ
of
was
sued
out
before
chamberlain

who
lived
some
six
miles
from
dixon
made
returnable
before
hon
john
caton
judge
of
the
ninth
judicial
circuit
at
ottawa
before
starting
for
ottawa
however
joseph
learned
that
cyrus
walker
was
in
the
vicinity
on
an
electioneering
tour
he
being
the
whig
candidate
for
congress
from
that
district
and
the
prophet
attempted
to
secure
his
services
in
his
defense
as
he
was
the
greatest
criminal
lawyer
in
that
part
of
illinois
walker
however
refused
to
engage
in
his
defense
unless
joseph
would
agree
to
vote
for
him
at
the
coming
election
and
the
prophet
promised
him
his
vote
writs
were
sued
out
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
against
reynolds
and
wilson
for
making
threats
against
the
lives
of
markham
and
joseph
and
another

for
a

of

in
relation
to

still
another
this
time
from
the

for
private
injuries
false
imprisonment
claiming
damages
whether
or
not
the
sheriffs
were
released
from
the
first
writ
i
can
not
learn
but
on
the
last
writ
they
were
held
in
bonds
and
as
they
could
get
no
bondsmen
this
side
of
missouri
they
were
taken
in
charge
by
the
sheriff
of
lee
county
and
were
under
the
necessity
of
obtaining
a
writ
of
themselves
so
that
while
joseph
was
the
prisoner
of
reynolds
and
wilson
pending
the
hearing
on
the
writ
of
he
had
sued
out
they
were
prisoners
under
the
same
circumstances
in
charge
of
the
sheriff
of
lee
county
and
in
this
manner
all
started
for
ottawa
for
a
hearing
on
the
several
writs
before
judge
caton
the
whole
company
left
dixon
on
the
of
june
and
the
same
day
arrived
at
pawpaw
grove
a
distance
of
miles
the
arrival
of
the
prophet
and
party
at
pawpaw
grove
created
no
little
excitement
and
the
next
morning
the
people
gathered
into
the
largest
room
in
the
hotel
and
insisted
upon
hearing
the
prophet
preach
to
this
sheriff
reynolds
objected
and
said
to
the
people
i
wish
you
to
understand
this
man
pointing
to
joseph
is
my
prisoner
and
i
want
you
should
disperse
at
this
an
old
gentleman
by
the
name
of
david

spoke
up
and
said

damned
infernal
puke
we
learn
you
to
come
here
and

down
there
pointing
to
a
very
low

you
never

lame
and
carried
with
him
a
heavy
hickory
walking
stick
with
which
he
emphasized
the
significant
parts
of
his
speech
by
striking
the
end
of
it
on
the
floor
it
had
the
desired
effect
on
reynolds
who
humbly
took
his
seat
while
the
prophet
without
an
interruption
addressed
the
company
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
subject
of
marriage
at
this
point
it
was
learned
that
judge
caton
was
absent
in
the
state
of
new
york
hence
the
party
returned
to
dixon
and
the
officers
made
returns
on
the
respective
writs

however
were
sued
out
and
at

made
to

before
the
nearest

in

thereby
hangs

were
made
with
a
lucien

who
was
in
the
stagecoach
business
to
take
the
respective
prisoners
to
quincy
a
distance
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
to
obtain
a
hearing
on
the
several
writs
before
judge

joseph
convinced
his
lawyers
and
sheriff
campbell
of
lee
county
and
others
that
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
had
the
right
to

minor
matters
in
the
new
move
against
the
prophet
it
now
becomes
necessary
to
note
a
few
minor
events
that
occurred
as
soon
as
the
sheriffs
started
for
dixon
with
joseph
in
their
power
emma
smith
had
her
carriage
made
ready
and
at
once
started
for
nauvoo
with
her
children
in
order
to
set
some
scheme
or
other
on
foot
looking
to
her
husband
deliverance
joseph
when
arriving
at
dixon
a
prisoner
dispatched
william
clayton
with
a
message
to
his
brother
hyrum
telling
what
had
befallen
him
and
requesting
that
assistance
be
at
once
sent
to
him
clayton
boarded
the
steamer
at
rock
island
and
arrived
in
nauvoo
about
two
in
the
afternoon
of
sunday
the
of
june
meeting
was
in
progress
when
hyrum
stepped
into
the
stand
and
interrupted
the
proceedings
by
announcing
that
he
wanted
to
meet
with
the
brethren
at
the
masonic
hall
the
quiet
of
the
sabbath
was
immediately
changed
into
excitement
and
the
brethren
rushed
to
the
hall
in
such
numbers
that
not
could
gain
admittance
so
the
meeting
was
adjourned
to
the
green
where
a
hollow
square
was
formed
about
hyrum
who
related
the
story
clayton
had
told
him
respecting
the
capture
of
his
brother
and
called
for
volunteers
to
go
to
his
assistance
and
see
that
he
had
his
rights
immediately
three
hundred
offered
their
services
and
from
them
a
company
was
selected
such
as
was
needed
and
before
sunset
one
hundred
and
men
were
in
the
saddle
under
command
of
generals
wilson
law
and
rich
for
peoria
before
the
company
left
nauvoo
elder
wilford
woodruff
opened
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
and
invited
every
man
that
was
going
to
the
assistance
of
the
prophet
to
fill
his
flask
or
powder
horn
the
company
was
well
armed
and
well
mounted
and
presented
rather
a
formidable
appearance
besides
sending
out
this
company
to
find
and
protect
his
brother
hyrum
sent
about
men
on
the
steamer
of
a
small
steamboat
purchased
by
the
people
of
nauvoo
some
months
before
and
placed
under
the
command
of
captain
dan
jones
the
company
was
to
go
down
the
mississippi
to
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
thence
up
that
stream
as
far
as
peoria
for
it
was
expected
that
joseph
was
being
conveyed
to
ottawa
and
it
was
feared
by
hyrum
that
an
attempt
would
be
made
when
the
party
approached
the
illinois
river
to
convey
joseph
to
one
of
the
crafts
plying
between
peoria
and
louis
and
so
take
him
to
missouri
hence
this
company
on
the
of
was
instructed
to
take
the
course
mentioned
and
to
examine
the
steamboats
they
met
and
if
they
learned
that
the
prophet
was
a
prisoner
on
any
one
of
them
they
were
to
render
whatever
assistance
might
be
within
their
power
the
command
under
brothers
law
and
rich
divided
and
subdivided
in
going
through
the
country
and
on
the
a
small
company
under
the
command
of
captain
thomas
grover
met
stephen
markham
whom
joseph
had
dispatched
to
find
the
brethren
that
he
suspected
had
been
sent
from
nauvoo
to
his
assistance
markham
had
instructions
to
meet
the
prophet
with
any
company
of
brethren
he
might
find
at
monmouth
near
monmouth
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
main
body
of
friends
reynolds
and
wilson
planned
a
scheme
of
going
into
that
town
raising
a
mob
and
taking
the
prophet
by
force
into
missouri
the
plot
failed
however
as
it
was
overheard
by
conover
and
sheriff
campbell
took
both
wilson
and
reynolds
into
his
immediate
custody
these
men
had
a
strong
dislike
of
going
to
nauvoo
as
they
feared
they
would
never
leave
the
place
alive
but
the
prophet
pledged
his
word
that
no
harm
should
befall
them
as
the
friends
of
joseph
kept
dropping
in
singly
or
in
squads
the
fear
of
his
enemies
increased
reynolds
made
special
inquiries
as
to
whether
jem
flack
was
in
the
company
and
on
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
exclaimed
as
he
turned
deathly
pale
i
am
a
dead
man
for
he
had
given
flack
a
deadly
provocation
when
flack
rode
up
however
the
prophet
called
him
up
to
him
and
strictly
charged
him
that
whatever
insult
he
had
received
from
reynolds
not
to
injure
a
hair
of
his
head
since
he
had
given
his
word
of
honor
that
he
should
not
be
injured
and
flack
agreed
to
let
him
alone
before
noon
of
the
thirtieth
joseph
company
which
now
numbered
about
one
hundred
and
forty
approached
nauvoo
word
had
previously
been
sent
in
as
to
the
probable
time
of
his
arrival
and
the
people
prepared
to
give
him
a
royal
reception
hyrum
smith
and
emma
accompanied
by
the
brass
band
and
a
long
train
of
carriages
met
the
prophet
company
a
mile
and
a
half
north
of
the
city
and
received
him
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
knew
no
bounds
the
prophet
met
his
brother
and
wife
with
a
fond
embrace
from
the
latter
only
a
few
days
before
he
had
been
torn
away
in
the
most
arbitrary
and
cruel
manner
and
their
reunion
was
a
joy
indeed
joseph
now
mounted
his
favorite
horse
old
charley
and
with
emma
riding
proudly
at
his
side
and
surrounded
by
his
body
guard
he
led
the
procession
into
the
city
amid
the
enthusiastic
cheers
of
the
people
the
firing
of
musketry
and
cannon
and
the
lively
strains
of
the
band
at
the
gate
of
the
mansion
stood
the
prophet
mother
with
tears
of
joy
rolling
down
her
aged
cheeks
to
welcome
her
son
whom
she
had
seen
so
many
times
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
here
too
his
children
flocked
about
him
and
welcomed
him
with
unreserved
childish
delight
the
vast
crowd
that
had
gathered
in
front
of
the
mansion
appeared
unwilling
to
leave
without
some
word
from
their
revered
leader
when
he
observed
this
he
mounted
the
fence
thanked
them
and
blessed
them
for
their
kindness
to
him
and
told
them
he
would
address
them
in
the
grove
near
the
temple
at
four
a
company
of
fifty
sat
down
at
the
prophet
table
to
partake
of
the
feast
provided
and
wilson
and
reynolds
who
had
treated
him
so
inhumanly
when
he
was
in
their
power
were
placed
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
waited
upon
by
emma
with
the
utmost
regard
for
their
comfort
though
they
had
denied
her
speech
with
her
husband
and
were
not
even
willing
that
she
should
take
to
him
his
hat
and
coat
gall
to
them
indeed
must
have
been
the
kindness
of
the
prophet
and
his
wife
whom
but
a
few
days
before
they
had
treated
with
such
harshness
in
the
afternoon
several
thousand
people
assembled
at
the
grove
and
at
four
the
prophet
addressed
them
in
an
animated
speech
of
considerable
length
in
which
he
related
to
them
his
adventures
while
in
the
power
of
his
enemies
and
contended
that
the
municipal
court
had
the
right
to
hear
cases
arising
under
writs
of
in
the
course
of
his
speech
he
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
fervor
of
his
eloquence
beyond
the
bounds
of
prudence
a
circumstance
however
that
will
create
no
astonishment
when
the
excitement
and
the
indignation
under
which
he
was
laboring
and
that
arose
out
of
sense
of
outraged
justice
and
humanity
is
taken
into
consideration
under
such
circumstances
and
from
such
temperaments
as
that
of
the
prophet
we
shall
look
in
vain
at
such
times
for
dispassionate
discourse
and
more
than
human
must
that
man
be
who
under
the
accumulated
wrongs
of
years
of
oppression
can
always
confine
his
speech
when
recounting
those
wrongs
within
the
lines
that
cold
calculating
wisdom
would
draw
the
speech
however
was
doubtless
one
of
the
most
characteristic
that
we
have
of
the
prophet
and
for
that
reason
i
give
it
as
reported
by
elders
willard
richards
and
wilford
woodruff
it
should
also
be
remarked
that
the
report
was
made
in
and
doubtless
there
exist
many
imperfections
in
it
and
it
should
only
be
regarded
as
a
synopsis
of
his
speech
the
congregation
is
large
i
shall
require
attention
i
discovered
what
the
emotions
of
the
people
were
on
my
arrival
at
this
city
and
i
have
come
here
to
say
how
do
you
do
to
all
parties
and
i
do
now
at
this
time
say
to
all
how
do
you
do
i
meet
you
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
to
almighty
god
and
i
presume
you
all
feel
the
same
i
am
well
i
am
hearty
i
hardly
know
how
to
express
my
feelings
i
feel
as
strong
as
a
giant
i
pulled
sticks
with
the
men
coming
along
and
i
pulled
up
with
one
hand
the
strongest
man
that
could
be
found
then
two
men
tried
but
they
could
not
pull
me
up
and
i
continued
to
pull
mentally
until
i
pulled
missouri
to
nauvoo
but
i
will
pass
from
that
subject
there
has
been
great
excitement
in
the
country
since
joseph
reynolds
and
harmon
wilson
took
me
but
i
have
been
cool
and
dispassionate
through
the
whole
thank
god
i
am
now
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
and
not
in
the
hands
of
missourians
it
is
not
so
much
my
object
to
tell
of
my
afflictions
trials
and
troubles
as
to
speak
of
the
writ
of
so
that
the
minds
of
all
may
be
corrected
it
has
been
asserted
by
the
great
and
wise
men
lawyers
and
others
that
our
municipal
powers
and
legal
tribunals
are
not
to
be
sanctioned
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
and
accordingly
want
to
make
it
lawful
to
drag
away
innocent
men
from
their
families
and
friends
and
have
them
put
to
death
by
ungodly
men
for
their
religion
relative
to
our
city
charter
courts
right
of
i
wish
you
to
know
and
publish
that
we
have
all
power
and
if
any
man
from
this
time
forth
says
anything
to
the
contrary
cast
it
into
his
teeth
there
is
a
secret
in
this
if
there
is
not
power
in
our
charter
and
courts
then
there
is
not
power
in
the
state
of
illinois
nor
in
the
congress
or
constitution
of
the
united
states
for
the
united
states
gave
unto
illinois
her
constitution
or
charter
and
illinois
gave
unto
nauvoo
her
charters
ceding
unto
us
our
vested
rights
which
she
has
no
right
or
power
to
take
from
us
all
the
power
there
was
in
illinois
she
gave
to
nauvoo
and
any
man
that
says
to
the
contrary
is
a
fool
the
municipal
court
has
all
the
power
to
issue
and
determine
writs
of
within
the
limits
of
this
city
that
the
legislature
can
confer
this
city
has
all
the
power
that
the
state
courts
have
and
was
given
by
the
same
authority
the
legislature
i
want
you
to
hear
and
learn
o
israel
this
day
what
is
for
the
happiness
and
peace
of
this
city
and
people
if
our
enemies
are
determined
to
oppress
us
and
deprive
us
of
our
constitutional
rights
and
privileges
as
they
have
done
and
if
the
authorities
that
are
on
the
earth
will
not
sustain
us
in
our
rights
nor
give
us
that
protection
which
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
state
guarantee
unto
us
then
we
will
claim
them
from
a
higher
power
from
heaven
yea
from
god
almighty
i
have
dragged
these
men
here
by
my
hand
and
will
do
it
again
but
i
swear
i
will
not
deal
so
mildly
with
them
again
for
the
time
has
come
when
is
no
longer
a
and
if
you
or
i
are
again
taken
unlawfully
you
are
at
liberty
to
give
loose
to
blood
and
thunder
but
be
cool
be
deliberate
be
wise
act
with
almighty
power
and
when
you
pull
do
it
effectually
make
a
for
once
my
lot
has
always
been
cast
among
the
people
in
every
time
of
trouble
friends
even
among
strangers
have
been
raised
up
unto
me
and
assisted
me
the
time
has
come
when
the
vail
is
torn
off
from
the
state
of
illinois
and
its
citizens
have
delivered
me
from
the
state
of
missouri
friends
that
were
raised
up
unto
me
would
have
spilt
their
life
blood
to
have
torn
me
from
the
hands
of
reynolds
and
wilson
if
i
had
asked
them
but
i
told
them
no
i
would
be
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
and
generalship
and
i
have
brought
these
men
to
nauvoo
and
committed
them
to
her
from
whom
i
was
torn
not
as
prisoners
in
chains
but
as
prisoners
of
kindness
i
have
treated
them
kindly
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
rewarding
them
good
for
evil
they
took
me
unlawfully
treated
me
rigorously
strove
to
deprive
me
of
my
rights
and
would
have
run
with
me
into
missouri
to
have
been
murdered
if
providence
had
not
interposed
but
now
they
are
in
my
hands
and
i
have
taken
them
into
my
house
set
them
at
the
head
of
my
table
and
placed
before
them
the
best
which
my
house
afforded
and
they
were
waited
upon
by
my
wife
whom
they
deprived
of
seeing
me
when
i
was
taken
i
have
no
doubt
but
i
shall
be
discharged
by
the
municipal
court
were
i
before
any
good
tribunal
i
should
be
discharged
as
the
missouri
writs
are
illegal
and
good
for
nothing
they
are
without
form
and
void
but
before
i
will
bear
this
unhallowed
persecution
any
longer
before
i
will
be
dragged
away
again
among
my
enemies
for
trial
will
spill
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
and
will
see
all
my
in
hell
to
bear
it
any
longer
would
be
a
sin
and
i
will
not
bear
it
any
longer
shall
we
bear
it
any
longer
one
universal
no
ran
through
all
that
vast
assembly
like
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
i
wish
the
lawyer
who
says
we
have
no
powers
in
nauvoo
may
be
choked
to
death
with
his
own
words
do
employ
lawyers
or
pay
them
money
for
their
knowledge
for
i
have
learnt
that
they
know
anything
i
know
more
than
they
all
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
he
that
believeth
in
our
chartered
rights
may
come
here
and
be
saved
and
he
that
does
not
shall
remain
in
ignorance
if
any
lawyer
shall
say
there
is
more
power
in
other
places
and
charters
with
respect
to
than
in
nauvoo
believe
it
not
i
have
converted
this
candidate
for
congress
pointing
to
cyrus
walker
that
the
right
of
is
included
in
our
charter
if
he
continues
converted
i
will
vote
for
him
i
have
been
with
these
lawyers
and
they
have
treated
me
well
but
i
am
here
in
nauvoo
and
the
missourians
too
i
got
here
by
a
lawful
writ
of
issued
by
the
master
of
chancery
of
lee
county
and
made
returnable
to
the
nearest
tribunal
in
the
fifth
judicial
district
having
jurisdiction
to
try
and
determine
such
writs
and
here
is
that
tribunal
just
as
it
should
be
however
indignant
you
may
feel
about
the
high
hand
of
oppression
which
has
been
raised
against
me
by
these
men
use
not
the
hand
of
violence
against
them
for
they
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
come
here
till
i
pledged
my
honor
and
my
life
that
a
hair
of
their
heads
should
not
be
hurt
will
you
all
support
my
pledge
and
thus
preserve
my
honor
one
universal
yes
burst
from
the
assembled
thousands
this
is
another
proof
of
your
attachment
to
me
i
know
how
ready
you
are
to
do
right
you
have
done
great
things
and
manifested
your
love
towards
me
in
flying
to
my
assistance
on
this
occasion
i
bless
you
in
the
name
of
the
lord
with
all
the
blessings
of
heaven
and
earth
you
are
capable
of
enjoying
i
have
learnt
that
we
have
no
need
to
suffer
as
we
have
heretofore
we
can
call
others
to
our
aid
i
know
the
almighty
will
bless
all
good
men
he
will
bless
you
and
the
time
has
come
when
there
will
be
such
a
flocking
to
the
standard
of
liberty
as
never
has
been
or
shall
be
hereafter
what
an
era
has
commenced
our
enemies
have
prophesied
that
we
would
establish
our
religion
by
the
sword
it
true
no
but
if
missouri
will
not
stay
her
cruel
hand
in
her
unhallowed
persecutions
against
us
i
restrain
you
not
any
longer
i
say
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
by
the
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
i
this
day
turn
the
key
that
opens
the
heavens
to
restrain
you
no
longer
from
this
time
forth
i
will
lead
you
to
the
battle
and
if
you
are
not
afraid
to
die
and
feel
disposed
to
spill
your
blood
in
your
own
defense
you
will
not
offend
me
be
not
the
aggressor
bear
until
they
strike
you
on
one
cheek
then
offer
the
other
and
they
will
be
sure
to
strike
that
defend
and
god
will
bear
you
off
and
you
shall
stand
forth
clear
before
his
tribunal
if
any
citizens
of
illinois
say
that
we
shall
not
have
our
rights
treat
them
as
strangers
and
not
friends
and
let
them
go
to
hell
and
be
damned
some
say
they
will
mob
us
let
them
mob
and
be
damned
if
we
have
to
give
up
our
chartered
rights
privileges
and
freedom
which
our
fathers
fought
bled
and
died
for
and
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
state
guarantee
unto
us
we
will
do
it
only
at
the
point
of
the
sword
and
bayonet
many
lawyers
contend
for
those
things
which
are
against
the
rights
of
men
and
can
only
excuse
them
because
of
their
go
forth
and
advocate
the
laws
and
rights
of
the
people
ye
lawyers
if
not
do
get
into
my
hands
or
under
the
lash
of
my
tongue
lawyers
say
the
powers
of
the
nauvoo
charter
are
dangerous
but
i
ask
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
of
this
state
dangerous
no
neither
are
the
charters
granted
unto
nauvoo
by
the
legislature
of
illinois
dangerous
and
those
who
say
they
are
are
fools
we
have
not
enjoyed
unmolested
those
rights
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
our
charters
grant
missouri
and
all
wicked
men
raise
the
hue
and
cry
against
us
and
are
not
satisfied
some
political
aspirants
of
this
state
also
are
raising
the
hue
and
cry
that
the
powers
in
the
charters
granted
unto
the
city
of
nauvoo
are
dangerous
and
although
the
general
assembly
have
conferred
them
upon
our
city
yet
the
whine
is
raised
repeal
them
take
them
away
like
the
boy
who
swapped
off
his
and
then
cried
daddy
daddy
i
have
sold
my
and
got
sick
of
my
bargain
and
i
want
to
get
it
back
again
but
how
are
they
going
to
help
themselves
raise
mobs
and
what
can
mobocrats
do
in
the
midst
of
kirkpatrickites
no
better
than
a
hunter
in
the
claws
of
a
bear
if
mobs
come
upon
you
any
more
here
dung
your
gardens
with
them
we
do
want
any
excitement
but
after
we
have
done
all
we
will
rise
up
and
break
off
the
hellish
yoke
that
oppresses
us
and
we
will
not
be
mobbed
the
day
before
i
was
taken
at
inlet
grove
i
rode
with
my
wife
through
dixon
to
visit
my
friends
and
i
said
to
her
here
is
a
good
people
i
felt
this
by
the
spirit
of
god
the
next
day
i
was
a
prisoner
in
their
midst
in
the
hands
of
reynolds
of
missouri
and
wilson
of
carthage
as
the
latter
drove
up
he
exclaimed
ha
ha
ha
by
g
we
have
got
the
prophet
now
he
gloried
much
in
it
but
he
is
now
our
prisoner
when
they
came
to
take
me
they
held
two
cocked
pistols
to
my
head
and
saluted
me
with
g
d
you
i
shoot
you
i
shoot
you
g
d
you
repeating
these
threats
nearly
fifty
times
from
first
to
last
i
asked
them
what
they
wanted
to
shoot
me
for
they
said
they
would
do
it
if
i
made
any
resistance
oh
very
well
i
replied
i
have
no
resistance
to
make
they
then
dragged
me
away
and
i
asked
them
by
what
authority
they
did
these
things
they
said
by
a
writ
from
the
governors
of
missouri
and
illinois
i
then
told
them
i
wanted
a
writ
of
their
reply
was
g
d
you
sha
have
i
told
a
man
to
go
to
dixon
and
get
me
a
writ
of
wilson
then
repeated
g
d
you
sha
have
it
i
shoot
you
when
we
arrived
at
dixon
i
sent
for
a
lawyer
who
came
and
reynolds
shut
the
door
in
his
face
and
would
not
let
me
speak
to
him
repeating
g
d
you
i
shoot
you
i
turned
to
him
opened
my
bosom
and
told
him
to
shoot
away
i
have
endured
so
much
persecution
and
oppression
that
i
am
sick
of
life
why
then
do
you
shoot
and
have
done
with
it
instead
of
talking
so
much
about
it
this
somewhat
checked
his
insolence
i
then
told
him
that
i
have
counsel
to
consult
and
eventually
i
obtained
my
wish
the
lawyers
came
to
me
and
i
got
a
writ
of
for
myself
and
also
a
writ
against
reynolds
and
wilson
for
unlawful
proceedings
and
cruel
treatment
towards
me
thanks
to
the
good
citizens
of
dixon
who
nobly
took
their
stand
against
such
unwarrantable
and
unlawful
oppression
my
persecutors
could
not
get
out
of
the
town
that
night
although
when
they
first
arrived
they
swore
i
should
not
remain
in
dixon
five
minutes
and
i
found
they
had
ordered
horses
accordingly
to
proceed
to
rock
island
i
pledged
my
honor
to
my
counsel
that
the
nauvoo
city
charter
conferred
jurisdiction
to
investigate
the
subject
so
we
came
to
nauvoo
where
i
am
now
a
prisoner
in
the
custody
of
a
higher
tribunal
than
the
circuit
court
the
charter
says
that
the
city
council
shall
have
power
and
authority
to
make
ordain
establish
and
execute
such
ordinances
not
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
of
this
state
as
they
may
deem
necessary
for
the
peace
benefit
and
safety
of
the
inhabitants
of
said
city
and
also
that
the
municipal
court
shall
have
power
to
grant
writs
of
in
all
cases
arising
under
the
ordinances
of
the
city
council
the
city
council
have
passed
an
ordinance
that
no
citizen
of
this
city
shall
be
taken
out
of
this
city
by
any
writ
without
the
privilege
of
a
writ
of
there
is
nothing
but
what
we
have
power
over
except
where
restricted
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
says
the
mob
what
dangerous
powers
yes
dangerous
because
they
will
protect
the
innocent
and
put
down
mobocrats
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
declares
that
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
shall
not
be
denied
deny
me
the
writ
of
and
i
will
fight
with
gun
sword
cannon
whirlwind
and
thunder
until
they
are
used
up
like
the
kilkenny
cats
we
have
more
power
than
most
charters
confer
because
we
have
power
to
go
behind
the
writ
and
try
the
merits
of
the
case
if
these
powers
are
dangerous
then
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
this
state
are
dangerous
but
they
are
not
dangerous
to
good
men
they
are
only
so
to
bad
men
who
are
breakers
of
the
laws
so
with
the
laws
of
the
country
and
so
with
the
ordinances
of
nauvoo
they
are
dangerous
to
mobs
but
not
to
good
men
who
wish
to
keep
the
laws
we
do
not
go
out
of
nauvoo
to
disturb
anybody
or
any
city
town
or
place
why
then
need
they
be
troubled
about
us
let
them
not
meddle
with
our
affair
but
let
us
alone
after
we
have
been
deprived
of
our
rights
and
privileges
of
citizenship
driven
from
town
to
town
place
to
place
and
state
to
state
with
the
sacrifice
of
our
homes
and
lands
our
blood
has
been
shed
many
having
been
murdered
and
all
this
because
of
our
religion
because
we
worship
almighty
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
our
conscience
shall
we
longer
bear
these
cruelties
which
have
been
heaped
upon
us
for
the
last
ten
years
in
the
face
of
heaven
and
in
open
violation
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
these
united
states
and
of
this
state
god
forbid
it
will
not
bear
if
they
take
away
my
rights
i
will
fight
for
them
manfully
and
righteously
until
i
am
used
up
we
have
done
nothing
against
the
rights
of
others
you
speak
of
lawyers
i
am
a
lawyer
too
but
the
almighty
god
has
taught
me
the
principle
of
law
and
the
true
meaning
and
intent
of
the
writ
of
is
to
defend
the
innocent
and
investigate
the
subject
go
behind
the
writ
and
if
the
form
of
one
that
is
issued
against
an
innocent
man
is
right
he
should
not
be
dragged
into
another
state
and
there
be
put
to
death
or
be
in
jeopardy
of
life
and
limb
because
of
prejudice
when
he
is
innocent
the
benefits
of
the
constitution
and
laws
are
alike
for
all
and
the
great
eloheim
has
given
me
the
privilege
of
having
the
benefits
of
the
constitution
and
the
writ
of
and
i
am
bold
to
ask
for
this
privilege
this
day
and
i
ask
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
and
all
that
is
sacred
that
i
may
have
your
lives
and
all
your
energies
to
carry
out
the
freedom
which
is
chartered
to
us
will
you
all
help
me
if
so
make
it
manifest
by
raising
the
right
hand
there
was
a
unanimous
response
a
perfect
sea
of
hands
being
elevated
here
is
truly
a
committee
of
the
whole
when
at
dixon
a
lawyer
came
to
me
as
counsel
reynolds
and
wilson
said
i
should
not
speak
to
any
man
and
they
would
shoot
any
man
who
should
dare
to
speak
to
me
an
old
man
came
up
and
said
i
should
have
counsel
and
he
was
not
afraid
of
their
pistols
the
people
of
dixon
were
ready
to
take
me
from
my
persecutors
and
i
could
have
killed
them
notwithstanding
their
pistols
but
i
had
no
disposition
to
kill
any
man
though
my
worst
enemy
not
even
boggs
in
fact
would
have
more
hell
to
live
in
the
reflection
of
his
past
crimes
than
to
die
after
this
i
had
lawyers
enough
and
i
obtained
a
writ
for
joseph
reynolds
and
harmon
wilson
for
damage
assault
and
battery
as
well
as
the
writ
of
we
started
for
ottoway
and
arrived
at
pawpaw
grove
miles
where
we
stopped
for
the
night
esquire
walker
sent
campbell
sheriff
of
lee
county
to
my
assistance
and
he
came
and
slept
by
me
in
the
morning
certain
men
wished
to
see
me
but
i
was
not
allowed
to
see
them
the
news
of
my
arrival
had
hastily
circulated
about
the
neighborhood
and
very
early
in
the
morning
the
largest
room
in
the
hotel
was
filled
with
citizens
who
were
anxious
to
hear
me
preach
and
requested
me
to
address
them
sheriff
reynolds
entered
the
room
and
said
pointing
to
me
i
wish
you
to
understand
this
man
is
my
prisoner
and
i
want
you
should
disperse
you
must
not
gather
around
in
this
way
upon
which
a
aged
gentleman
who
was
lame
and
carried
a
large
hickory
advanced
towards
reynolds
bringing
his
hickory
upon
the
floor
and
said
you
damned
infernal
puke
we
learn
you
to
come
here
and
interrupt
gentlemen
sit
down
there
pointing
to
a
very
low
char
and
sit
still
do
open
your
head
till
general
smith
gets
through
talking
if
you
never
learned
manners
in
missouri
we
teach
you
that
gentlemen
are
not
to
be
imposed
by
a
you
can
kidnap
men
here
if
you
do
in
missouri
and
if
you
attempt
it
here
there
a
committee
in
this
grove
that
will
sit
on
your
case
and
sir
it
is
the
highest
tribunal
in
the
united
states
from
its
decision
there
is
no
reynolds
no
doubt
aware
that
the
person
addressing
him
was
at
the
head
of
a
committee
who
had
prevented
the
settlers
on
the
public
domain
from
being
imposed
upon
by
land
speculators
sat
down
in
silence
while
i
addressed
the
assembly
for
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
subject
of
marriage
my
visitors
having
requested
me
to
give
them
my
views
of
the
law
of
god
respecting
marriage
my
freedom
commenced
from
that
hour
we
came
direct
from
pawpaw
grove
to
nauvoo
having
got
our
writ
directed
to
the
nearest
court
having
authority
to
try
the
case
which
was
the
municipal
court
of
this
city
it
did
my
soul
good
to
see
your
feelings
and
love
manifested
towards
me
i
thank
god
that
i
have
the
honor
to
lead
so
virtuous
and
honest
a
people
to
be
your
leader
and
lawyer
as
was
moses
to
the
children
of
israel
hosannah
hosannah
to
almighty
god
who
has
delivered
us
thus
from
out
of
the
seven
troubles
i
commend
you
to
his
grace
and
may
the
blessings
of
heaven
rest
upon
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
amen
president
smith
then
introduced
cyrus
walker
to
the
assembled
multitude
and
remarked
to
him
these
are
the
greatest
dupes
as
a
body
of
people
that
ever
lived
or
i
am
not
as
big
a
rogue
as
i
am
reported
to
be
i
told
warren
i
would
not
discuss
the
subject
of
religion
with
you
i
understand
the
gospel
and
you
do
not
you
understand
the
quackery
of
law
and
i
do
not
walker
then
addressed
the
people
to
the
effect
that
from
what
he
had
seen
in
the
nauvoo
city
charter
it
gave
the
power
to
try
writs
of
etc
after
which
president
smith
continued
as
follows
if
the
legislature
have
granted
nauvoo
the
right
of
determining
cases
of
it
is
no
more
than
they
ought
to
have
done
or
more
than
our
fathers
fought
for
furthermore
if
missouri
continues
her
warfare
and
to
issue
her
writs
against
me
and
this
people
unlawfully
and
unjustly
as
she
has
done
and
to
take
away
and
trample
upon
our
rights
i
swear
in
the
name
of
almighty
god
and
with
uplifted
hands
to
heaven
i
will
spill
my
heart
blood
in
our
defense
they
shall
not
take
away
our
rights
and
if
they
do
stop
leading
me
by
the
nose
i
will
lead
them
by
the
nose
and
if
they
do
let
me
alone
i
will
turn
up
the
world
i
will
make
war
when
we
shake
our
own
bushes
we
want
to
catch
our
own
fruit
the
lawyers
themselves
acknowledge
that
we
have
all
power
granted
us
in
our
charters
that
we
could
ask
for
that
we
had
more
power
than
any
other
court
in
the
state
for
all
other
courts
were
restricted
while
ours
was
not
and
i
thank
god
almighty
for
it
i
will
not
be
rode
down
to
hell
by
the
missourians
any
longer
and
it
is
my
privilege
to
speak
in
my
own
defense
and
i
appeal
to
your
integrity
and
honor
that
you
will
stand
by
and
help
me
according
to
the
covenant
you
have
this
day
made
in
the
meantime
a
requisition
was
made
on
sheriff
reynolds
to
bring
his
prisoner
before
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
that
the
validity
of
the
writ
by
virtue
of
which
he
held
him
might
be
tested
reynolds
refused
to
recognize
the
summons
of
the
court
therefore
his
prisoner
petitioned
the
court
for
a
writ
of
to
be
directed
to
sheriff
reynolds
commanding
him
to
bring
his
prisoner
before
said
court
and
there
state
the
cause
of
his
capture
and
detention
in
order
that
the
lawfulness
of
his
arrest
might
be
inquired
into
reynolds
complied
with
the
attachment
and
the
prophet
was
delivered
into
the
charge
of
the
city
marshal
the
next
day
the
municipal
court
held
a
session
william
marks
acting
chief
justice
wells
whitney
harris
gustavus
hills
and
hiram
kimball
associate
justices
when
joseph
was
on
trial
for
this
same
offense
before
judge
douglass
on
a
writ
of
in
as
already
related
in
a
previous
chapter
the
court
refused
to
enter
into
the
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
case
as
the
judge
doubted
whether
on
a
writ
of
he
had
a
right
to
go
behind
the
writ
and
inquire
into
the
merits
of
the
case
the
same
point
was
avoided
by
judge
pope
in
the
hearing
joseph
had
before
him
on
a
similar
writ
when
charged
with
being
accessory
before
the
fact
in
an
assault
upon
the
life
of
boggs
but
the
municipal
court
had
no
such
scruples
and
at
once
proceeded
to
try
the
case
on
its
merits
and
hyrum
smith
pratt
brigham
young
pitkin
lyman
wight
and
sidney
rigdon
were
examined
as
witnesses
their
affidavits
before
that
court
concerning
events
that
happened
to
the
saints
in
missouri
afford
the
most
circumstantial
reliable
and
exhaustive
data
for
the
history
of
the
church
while
in
that
state
that
has
ever
been
published
after
hearing
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
the
pleading
of
counsel
the
court
ordered
that
joseph
smith
be
released
from
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
which
he
complained
for
want
of
substance
in
the
warrant
by
which
he
was
held
as
well
as
upon
the
merits
of
the
case
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
held
a
mass
meeting
and
passed
resolutions
thanking
the
people
of
dixon
and
vicinity
and
of
lee
county
generally
for
the
stand
they
had
taken
in
defense
of
the
innocent
and
in
favor
of
law
and
justice
a
copy
of
the
proceedings
of
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
and
of
all
the
papers
connected
with
the
case
were
immediately
sent
to
the
governor
as
also
were
affidavits
from
leading
counsel
and
gentlemen
from
dixon
as
to
the
treatment
of
wilson
and
reynolds
that
the
governor
and
the
world
might
know
that
they
had
not
been
injured
we
may
conclude
the
account
of
this
adventure
of
joseph
by
saying
that
about
a
year
afterwards
a
jury
in
lee
county
awarded
forty
dollars
damages
and
costs
against
wilson
and
reynolds
for
false
imprisonment
and
abuse
of
the
prophet
a
verdict
which
while
it
confirms
the
unlawful
course
of
those
officers
and
the
fact
that
their
prisoner
was
abused
insults
justice
by
awarding
such
an
amount
for
damages
at
the
time
of
this
action
before
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
it
was
a
question
in
illinois
whether
said
court
had
the
authority
to
hear
and
determine
writs
of
arising
from
arrests
made
by
virtue
of
warrants
issued
by
the
courts
of
the
state
or
of
the
governor
as
in
the
foregoing
case
or
whether
the
clause
in
the
city
charter
granting
the
right
of
issuing
such
writs
was
not
confined
to
cases
arising
from
arrests
made
on
account
of
the
violation
of
some
city
ordinance
the
clause
in
the
charter
giving
to
the
municipal
court
the
power
to
issue
writs
of
was
as
follows
the
municipal
court
shall
have
power
to
grant
writs
of
in
all
cases
arising
under
the
ordinances
of
the
city
council
and
in
addition
there
was
the
general
welfare
provision
which
provided
that
the
city
council
shall
have
power
and
authority
to
make
ordain
establish
and
execute
such
ordinances
not
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
of
this
state
as
they
may
deem
necessary
for
the
peace
benefit
and
safety
of
the
inhabitants
of
said
city
it
was
maintained
on
the
part
of
those
who
believed
that
the
municipal
court
had
the
right
to
issue
writs
of
against
process
issued
from
the
state
courts
that
all
the
power
there
was
in
illinois
she
gave
to
nauvoo
and
that
the
municipal
court
had
all
the
power
within
the
limits
of
the
city
that
the
state
courts
had
and
that
power
was
given
by
the
same
authority
the
legislature
a
number
of
lawyers
of
more
or
less
prominence
in
the
state
professed
to
hold
the
same
views
but
little
reliance
can
be
put
in
the
support
they
bring
to
the
case
since
they
were
seeking
political
preferment
and
would
and
did
in
their
interpretations
of
the
powers
granted
by
the
charter
favor
that
side
of
the
controversy
most
likely
to
please
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
governor
ford
too
at
the
time
gave
a
tacit
approval
of
the
course
taken
by
the
municipal
court
in
issuing
the
writ
of
though
he
afterwards
became
very
pronounced
in
his
opposition
to
the
exercise
of
such
powers
it
occurred
in
this
way
as
soon
as
joseph
was
liberated
sheriff
reynolds
applied
to
governor
ford
for
a
posse
to
retake
him
representing
that
the
prophet
had
been
unlawfully
taken
out
of
his
hands
by
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
the
governor
refused
to
grant
the
petition
subsequently
the
governor
of
missouri
asked
governor
ford
to
call
out
the
militia
to
retake
joseph
but
this
he
also
refused
to
do
and
gave
as
a
reason
that
no
process
officer
or
authority
of
the
state
had
been
resisted
or
interfered
with
and
recited
how
the
prisoner
had
been
released
on
by
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
the
governor
acted
in
this
instance
with
perfect
knowledge
of
what
had
taken
place
for
the
petition
and
statement
of
reynolds
were
in
his
possession
as
were
also
complete
copies
of
all
the
documents
which
contained
the
proceedings
before
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
and
in
addition
to
these
sources
of
information
the
governor
had
dispatched
a
trusted
secret
agent
a
brayman
to
nauvoo
who
investigated
the
case
and
reported
the
result
to
him
on
the
other
hand
it
was
contended
that
the
grant
in
the
charter
was
intended
by
the
legislature
only
to
give
the
power
to
the
municipal
court
to
issue
writs
of
in
cases
of
arrest
for
violation
of
city
ordinances
and
that
giving
power
to
the
municipal
court
to
test
the
warrants
or
processes
issued
from
the
state
courts
was
never
contemplated
by
the
legislature
and
that
the
passage
of
any
ordinance
by
the
city
council
that
would
bring
about
or
authorize
any
such
unusual
proceeding
was
an
unwarranted
assumption
of
power
utterly
wrong
in
principle
and
consequently
subversive
of
good
government
but
whatever
opinion
may
be
entertained
on
the
point
under
consideration
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
upon
the
broad
principles
of
justice
the
prophet
joseph
ought
to
have
been
set
free
the
state
of
missouri
had
no
just
claims
upon
him
he
had
been
arrested
and
several
times
examined
on
these
old
charges
now
revived
by
the
personal
malice
of
john
bennett
and
after
being
held
a
prisoner
awaiting
indictment
and
trial
for
five
months
so
conscious
were
the
officers
of
the
state
that
they
had
no
case
against
him
that
they
themselves
connived
at
his
escape
after
such
proceedings
to
demand
that
he
be
dragged
again
into
missouri
among
his
old
enemies
was
an
outrage
against
every
principle
of
justice
chapter
xxxiii
political
perplexities
joseph
smith
a
candidate
for
president
of
the
united
states
the
events
related
in
the
last
two
chapters
occurred
on
the
eve
of
an
election
for
united
states
representatives
state
and
county
officers
the
whig
and
democratic
parties
were
so
divided
in
illinois
that
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
held
the
balance
of
power
in
the
congressional
district
where
they
were
located
and
also
in
the
county
whichever
party
they
voted
with
as
they
voted
unitedly
gained
the
election
this
circumstance
brought
to
the
people
of
nauvoo
many
concessions
and
caused
the
candidates
of
both
political
parties
to
fawn
at
their
feet
it
was
a
case
where
bell
boweth
down
and
nebo
stoopeth
but
we
shall
see
that
it
also
brought
with
it
serious
difficulties
that
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
hasten
the
fall
of
nauvoo
and
yet
it
was
a
situation
forced
upon
the
saints
rather
than
a
policy
deliberately
chosen
by
them
the
prophet
himself
has
given
the
very
best
explanation
of
the
enforced
necessity
of
the
saints
voting
unitedly
while
in
illinois
and
i
here
quote
that
explanation
with
regard
to
elections
some
say
all
the
saints
vote
together
and
vote
as
i
say
but
i
never
tell
any
man
how
to
vote
or
who
to
vote
for
but
i
will
show
you
how
we
have
been
situated
by
bringing
a
comparison
should
there
be
a
methodist
society
here
and
two
candidates
running
for
office
one
says
if
you
will
vote
for
me
and
put
me
in
governor
i
will
exterminate
the
methodists
take
away
their
charters
etc
the
other
candidate
says
if
i
am
governor
i
will
give
all
an
equal
privilege
which
would
the
methodists
vote
for
of
course
they
would
vote
for
the
candidate
that
would
give
them
their
rights
thus
it
has
been
with
us
joseph
duncan
said
if
the
people
would
elect
him
he
would
exterminate
the
mormons
and
take
away
their
charters
as
to
ford
he
made
no
such
threats
but
manifested
a
spirit
in
his
speeches
to
give
every
man
his
rights
hence
the
church
universally
voted
for
ford
and
he
was
elected
governor
in
the
election
above
referred
to
a
circumstance
occurred
which
greatly
intensified
the
political
bitterness
it
will
be
remembered
that
cyrus
walker
refused
to
assist
joseph
when
under
arrest
at
dixon
unless
he
would
pledge
him
his
vote
in
the
then
pending
election
this
joseph
did
and
walker
was
satisfied
that
he
would
go
to
congress
as
he
expected
that
joseph
vote
would
bring
to
him
the
entire
vote
of
nauvoo
which
would
insure
his
election
and
so
expressed
himself
to
stephen
markham
but
the
day
before
election
which
was
sunday
hyrum
told
joseph
that
the
spirit
had
manifested
it
to
him
that
it
would
be
to
the
best
interests
of
the
people
to
vote
the
democratic
ticket
including
hoge
the
democratic
candidate
for
congress
joseph
made
that
announcement
in
a
public
meeting
but
in
addressing
the
people
he
said
i
am
not
come
to
tell
you
to
vote
this
way
that
way
or
the
other
in
relation
to
national
matters
i
want
it
to
go
abroad
to
the
whole
world
that
every
man
should
stand
on
his
own
merits
the
lord
has
not
given
me
a
revelation
concerning
politics
i
have
not
asked
him
for
one
i
am
a
third
party
and
stand
independent
and
alone
i
desire
to
see
all
parties
protected
in
their
rights
referring
to
what
hyrum
had
communicated
to
him
he
said
i
never
knew
hyrum
to
say
he
ever
had
a
revelation
and
it
failed
let
god
speak
and
all
men
hold
their
peace
joseph
kept
his
pledge
personally
and
voted
for
cyrus
walker
but
the
democratic
ticket
was
overwhelmingly
successful
in
nauvoo
it
ought
to
be
said
here
in
justification
of
the
course
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
that
very
good
evidence
existed
to
the
effect
that
the
whole
difficulty
connected
with
the
arrest
of
joseph
at
dixon
on
the
old
missouri
charges
of
treason
arson
etc
was
a
political
scheme
planned
with
a
view
of
securing
the
mormon
vote
for
the
whig
party
the
state
in
july
published
the
following
on
the
subject
of
the
arrest
of
the
prophet
at
dixon
to
justify
the
charge
it
made
that
the
whole
affair
was
but
a
whig
plot
to
secure
the
mormon
vote
the
public
is
already
aware
that
a
demand
was
lately
made
upon
the
governor
of
this
state
for
the
arrest
of
joseph
smith
and
that
a
writ
was
accordingly
issued
against
him
we
propose
now
to
state
some
of
the
facts
furnishing
strong
grounds
of
suspicion
that
the
demand
which
was
made
on
the
governor
here
was
a
manoeuvre
of
the
whig
party
a
letter
was
shown
to
a
gentleman
of
this
city
by
the
agent
of
missouri
from
the
notorious
john
bennett
to
a
gentleman
in
one
of
the
western
counties
of
that
state
urging
the
importance
of
getting
up
an
indictment
immediately
against
smith
for
the
five
or
six
years
old
treason
of
which
he
was
accused
several
years
ago
this
charge
had
been
made
once
before
and
afterwards
abandoned
by
missouri
it
is
the
same
charge
on
which
smith
was
carried
before
judge
douglass
and
discharged
two
years
ago
after
that
decision
the
indictment
against
smith
was
dismissed
and
the
charge
wholly
abandoned
but
in
the
letter
alluded
to
bennett
says
to
his
missouri
agent
go
to
the
judge
and
never
leave
him
until
he
appoints
a
special
term
of
court
never
suffer
the
court
to
adjourn
until
an
indictment
is
found
against
smith
for
treason
when
an
indictment
shall
have
been
found
get
a
copy
and
go
immediately
to
the
governor
and
never
leave
him
until
you
get
a
demand
on
the
governor
of
illinois
for
smith
arrest
and
then
dispatch
some
active
and
vigilant
person
to
illinois
for
a
warrant
and
let
him
never
leave
the
governor
until
he
gets
it
and
then
never
let
him
come
back
to
missouri
without
smith
a
special
term
of
the
circuit
court
of
daviess
county
missouri
was
accordingly
called
on
the
day
of
june
last
an
indictment
was
found
against
smith
for
treason
five
years
old
a
demand
was
made
and
a
writ
issued
as
anticipated
by
the
of
the
same
month
bennett
it
is
well
known
has
for
a
year
past
been
a
mere
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
whig
junto
at
springfield
he
has
been
under
their
absolute
subjection
and
control
and
has
been
a
regular
correspondent
of
the
the
principal
organ
of
the
whig
party
he
has
been
a
great
pet
of
both
the
and
the
junto
and
that
paper
has
regularly
announced
his
removals
from
place
to
place
until
latterly
and
within
the
last
year
has
published
more
of
his
writings
than
of
any
other
person
except
the
editor
cyrus
walker
a
short
time
after
his
nomination
as
the
whig
candidate
for
congress
in
the
district
made
a
pilgrimage
to
nauvoo
for
the
purpose
of
currying
favor
with
the
mormons
and
getting
their
support
but
in
this
he
was
disappointed
and
dejected
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
failing
to
get
the
mormon
vote
he
would
be
beaten
by
his
democratic
opponent
let
it
be
also
borne
in
mind
that
the
treason
of
which
smith
was
accused
was
five
or
six
years
old
that
it
had
been
abandoned
as
a
charge
by
missouri
that
the
circuit
court
of
that
state
sat
three
times
a
year
that
smith
was
permanently
settled
at
nauvoo
no
person
dreaming
that
he
would
leave
there
for
years
to
come
that
they
might
have
waited
in
missouri
for
a
regular
term
of
the
court
if
the
design
was
simply
to
revive
a
charge
of
treason
against
smith
with
a
perfect
assurance
that
he
would
always
be
found
at
home
and
be
as
subject
to
arrest
at
one
time
as
another
but
this
delay
did
not
suit
the
conspirators
as
it
would
put
off
an
attempt
to
arrest
smith
until
after
the
august
election
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
also
that
the
agent
of
missouri
after
he
had
obtained
the
custody
of
smith
at
dixon
refused
to
employ
a
democratic
lawyer
and
insisted
upon
having
a
whig
lawyer
of
inferior
abilities
simply
upon
the
ground
as
he
stated
that
the
democrats
were
against
him
let
it
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
cyrus
walker
the
whig
candidate
for
congress
miraculously
to
be
within
six
miles
of
dixon
when
smith
was
arrested
ready
and
convenient
to
be
employed
by
smith
to
get
him
delivered
from
custody
and
that
he
was
actually
employed
and
actually
did
get
smith
enlarged
from
custody
and
withal
let
it
be
remembered
that
john
bennett
is
the
pliant
tool
and
pander
of
the
junto
at
springfield
and
that
he
was
the
instigator
of
an
unnecessary
special
term
in
missouri
on
the
day
of
june
last
for
the
purpose
of
getting
smith
indicted
we
say
let
all
these
facts
be
borne
in
mind
and
they
produce
a
strong
suspicion
if
not
conviction
that
the
whole
affair
is
a
whig
conspiracy
to
compel
a
democratic
governor
to
issue
a
writ
against
smith
pending
the
congressional
elections
so
as
to
incense
the
mormons
create
a
necessity
for
walker
and
perhaps
browning
professional
services
in
favor
of
smith
to
get
him
delivered
out
of
a
net
of
their
own
weaving
and
thereby
get
the
everlasting
gratitude
of
the
mormons
and
their
support
for
the
whig
cause
state
quoted
in
history
of
joseph
smith
millennial
star
vol
xxi
p
such
a
plot
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
joseph
and
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
would
certainly
justify
them
in
voting
against
the
perpetrators
of
such
an
outrage
of
course
it
can
not
be
denied
that
cyrus
walker
was
justified
in
believing
that
the
vote
of
joseph
smith
pledged
to
him
at
dixon
and
which
by
him
was
made
a
condition
precedent
to
his
coming
to
the
assistance
of
joseph
was
understood
as
meaning
something
more
than
the
individual
vote
of
the
prophet
nor
do
i
think
the
prophet
censurable
for
using
any
means
at
his
command
under
the
circumstances
to
deliver
himself
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
but
if
afterwards
the
people
of
nauvoo
learned
as
they
evidently
did
that
a
plot
had
been
laid
to
ensnare
them
to
secure
their
vote
though
it
involved
the
liberty
and
perhaps
the
life
of
their
they
were
justified
in
casting
their
votes
against
the
men
guilty
of
such
perfidy
this
sudden
and
unexpected
change
in
the
vote
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
stirred
up
to
the
very
depths
the
enmity
of
the
defeated
political
party
and
when
shortly
after
the
election
foster
who
had
been
elected
school
commissioner
and
thatcher
who
had
been
elected
clerk
of
the
commissioner
court
for
the
county
appeared
at
the
courthouse
in
carthage
to
take
the
oath
of
office
and
file
their
bonds
an
attempt
was
made
to
keep
them
from
doing
so
and
the
court
was
threatened
with
violence
if
the
mormons
were
permitted
to
qualify
they
qualified
nevertheless
whereupon
a
call
was
issued
for
an
meeting
to
convene
in
carthage
on
the
following
saturday
august
the
to
protest
against
the
mormons
holding
office
the
people
of
carthage
and
vicinity
assembled
at
the
appointed
time
organized
with
a
chairman
major
reuben
graves
and
a
secretary
abernethy
and
a
committee
of
nine
to
draft
resolutions
after
listening
to
speeches
by
valentine
wilson
walter
bagby
and
others
the
meeting
adjourned
to
meet
again
on
the
sixth
of
september
to
enumerate
the
crimes
alleged
against
the
saints
in
general
and
in
particular
against
joseph
smith
in
the
preamble
to
the
resolutions
adopted
at
their
second
meeting
would
be
drawing
up
a
list
of
all
the
crimes
that
ever
threatened
the
peace
happiness
prosperity
and
liberty
of
a
nation
they
resolved
that
from
recent
movements
among
the
mormons
there
were
indications
that
they
were
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
ordinary
restrictions
of
law
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
people
of
illinois
must
assert
their
rights
in
some
way
that
while
they
deprecated
anything
like
lawless
violence
they
pledged
themselves
to
resist
all
wrongs
the
mormons
should
inflict
upon
them
in
the
future
peaceably
if
they
could
but
forcibly
if
they
must
they
called
upon
all
good
and
honest
men
to
assist
in
humbling
the
pride
of
that
audacious
despot
joseph
smith
pledged
themselves
to
raise
a
posse
and
take
him
if
the
authorities
of
missouri
made
another
demand
for
him
that
it
might
not
be
said
of
them
that
they
allowed
the
most
outrageous
culprits
to
go
unwhipped
of
justice
they
agreed
to
support
no
man
of
either
political
party
who
should
truckle
to
the
mormons
for
their
influence
and
finally
resolved
that
when
the
government
ceases
to
afford
protection
the
citizens
of
course
fall
back
upon
their
original
inherent
right
of
one
of
the
principal
movers
in
these
meetings
was
walter
bagby
the
county
collector
with
whom
joseph
had
some
difficulty
in
relation
to
the
payment
of
taxes
in
the
dispute
that
arose
bagby
told
joseph
he
lied
and
for
this
insult
joseph
struck
him
and
would
doubtless
have
thrashed
him
soundly
but
for
the
interference
of
daniel
wells
from
that
time
on
bagby
became
the
relentless
enemy
of
joseph
and
the
inspirer
of
these
meetings
at
carthage
and
afterwards
went
to
missouri
where
he
conferred
with
the
prophet
old
enemies
and
brought
about
that
concerted
action
between
the
missourians
and
the
of
illinois
which
resulted
finally
in
his
assassination
later
in
the
fall
acts
of
violence
began
to
be
perpetrated
upon
the
mormon
people
who
lived
at
a
distance
from
nauvoo
and
threats
of
violence
were
frequent
in
december
of
the
year
of
which
i
am
now
writing
a
member
of
the
church
living
near
warsaw
by
the
name
of
daniel
avery
and
his
son
philander
were
kidnapped
by
levi
williams
of
warsaw
john
elliot
and
others
and
run
across
the
mississippi
to
missouri
where
for
several
weeks
daniel
avery
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
clark
county
while
one
joseph
mccoy
was
hunting
up
witnesses
to
prove
that
he
had
stolen
a
mare
from
him
philander
avery
escaped
and
returned
to
illinois
but
his
father
remained
a
prisoner
and
suffered
great
cruelty
at
the
hands
of
his
captors
finally
however
he
was
released
by
writ
of
and
went
to
nauvoo
where
he
made
affidavit
as
to
his
treatment
wild
rumors
abounded
also
as
to
what
the
missourians
intended
to
do
and
some
of
the
letters
from
missouri
that
fell
into
joseph
hands
through
friends
of
his
threatened
illinois
with
invasion
and
for
a
season
it
would
seem
that
a
border
war
was
inevitable
joseph
was
careful
to
keep
governor
ford
informed
as
to
all
acts
of
violence
perpetrated
upon
his
people
and
especially
as
to
the
threats
of
the
missourians
respecting
an
attack
and
went
so
far
as
to
tender
the
services
of
the
legion
to
repel
any
attempted
invasion
of
the
state
should
it
occur
governor
ford
however
refused
to
believe
there
was
any
danger
in
the
threats
and
therefore
would
detail
no
portion
of
the
legion
or
of
the
other
state
militia
to
be
ready
for
such
an
assault
a
petition
signed
by
nearly
all
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
asking
the
governor
to
issue
no
more
warrants
at
the
demand
of
missouri
for
the
arrest
of
joseph
smith
on
the
old
charges
was
presented
to
the
executive
but
the
governor
refused
to
give
the
people
any
encouragement
that
he
would
favorably
entertain
their
suit
in
the
meantime
another
important
event
began
to
take
shape
as
the
time
of
the
presidential
election
was
now
approaching
the
probable
candidates
for
the
office
began
to
be
discussed
it
was
well
known
that
the
vote
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
would
be
important
as
it
would
most
likely
determine
whether
illinois
would
go
whig
or
democratic
the
political
friends
of
john
calhoun
at
quincy
early
perceived
the
importance
of
securing
their
favor
and
began
to
work
for
it
a
colonel
frierson
of
quincy
the
political
friend
of
john
calhoun
expressed
great
sympathy
for
the
saints
because
of
the
injustice
and
persecution
they
had
received
at
the
hands
of
missouri
and
intimated
to
brother
joseph
heywood
that
the
hon
rhett
a
representative
from
south
carolina
to
the
united
states
congress
and
also
a
political
friend
to
calhoun
had
expressed
a
willingness
to
present
to
congress
a
memorial
for
a
redress
of
wrongs
suffered
by
the
saints
in
missouri
but
was
careful
to
intimate
to
brother
heywood
and
through
him
to
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
that
he
supposed
that
calhoun
would
be
a
more
acceptable
candidate
to
them
than
van
buren
colonel
frierson
afterwards
went
to
nauvoo
met
in
council
with
the
leading
citizens
and
drafted
a
memorial
to
congress
a
copy
of
which
he
took
with
him
to
quincy
to
obtain
signers
but
i
think
it
never
reached
the
house
of
representatives
the
incident
however
suggested
to
the
prophet
the
propriety
of
addressing
letters
to
each
of
the
candidates
for
the
presidency
five
in
number
john
calhoun
lewis
cass
richard
johnson
henry
clay
and
martin
van
buren
to
ascertain
what
policy
they
would
adopt
respecting
the
saints
and
redressing
the
wrongs
done
them
by
missouri
only
two
out
of
the
number
however
gave
a
reply
they
were
calhoun
and
clay
the
former
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
general
government
possessed
such
limited
and
specific
powers
that
the
missouri
troubles
did
not
come
within
its
jurisdiction
as
to
his
treatment
of
the
saints
as
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
union
made
no
distinction
between
citizens
of
different
religious
creeds
he
should
make
none
but
so
far
as
the
executive
was
concerned
all
should
have
the
full
benefit
of
both
and
none
should
be
exempted
from
their
operation
clay
partially
disclaimed
being
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
but
said
if
he
ever
entered
into
that
high
office
he
must
do
so
free
and
unfettered
with
no
guarantees
but
such
as
might
be
drawn
from
his
whole
life
character
and
conduct
but
he
was
careful
to
say
that
he
had
watched
the
progress
of
the
saints
and
sympathized
with
them
in
their
sufferings
under
injustice
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
them
and
thought
that
they
in
common
with
other
religious
communities
should
enjoy
the
security
and
protection
of
the
constitution
and
laws
to
these
letters
the
prophet
joseph
wrote
scathing
replies
the
particular
portion
of
calhoun
answer
with
which
he
dealt
was
that
which
claimed
that
the
general
government
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
the
saints
and
missouri
and
handled
rather
severely
the
senator
doctrine
of
the
limited
powers
of
the
general
government
in
reply
to
henry
clay
he
dealt
chiefly
with
his
no
pledge
nor
guarantee
doctrine
only
such
as
could
be
drawn
from
his
whole
life
character
and
conduct
and
drew
such
a
picture
of
that
statesman
past
conduct
that
the
kentucky
senator
could
not
feel
flattered
withal
to
say
the
least
and
in
good
round
terms
he
denounced
the
subterfuges
of
politicians
and
demanded
of
the
nation
justice
in
behalf
of
his
afflicted
people
in
reading
this
correspondence
one
can
not
but
think
that
the
prophet
is
unnecessarily
harsh
of
expression
and
some
phrases
we
can
not
help
but
feel
are
certainly
unworthy
of
him
the
faults
of
these
letters
however
are
not
so
much
the
fault
of
the
individual
as
the
fault
of
the
times
those
were
days
when
moderation
in
language
was
certainly
not
characteristic
of
the
political
literature
of
the
times
personal
abuse
often
seems
to
have
been
mistaken
for
argument
and
severity
of
expression
was
often
thought
to
reason
one
other
thing
should
be
remembered
also
and
that
is
the
prophet
joseph
very
largely
depended
upon
others
for
the
expression
for
the
literary
form
of
those
ideas
which
he
advanced
and
these
secondary
persons
yielded
too
often
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
in
what
they
set
down
as
coming
from
the
prophet
when
it
was
ascertained
that
from
none
of
the
candidates
in
the
field
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
could
hope
for
assistance
in
obtaining
justice
for
the
wrongs
they
suffered
in
missouri
joseph
allowed
a
convention
at
nauvoo
to
put
his
name
in
nomination
for
the
office
of
president
and
he
published
his
views
on
the
powers
and
policy
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
a
document
of
great
strength
and
one
which
excited
considerable
comment
from
the
press
of
the
country
very
much
of
which
was
favorable
in
this
document
the
reviews
the
growth
and
development
of
the
american
government
until
it
reached
the
of
american
glory
liberty
and
prosperity
under
the
administration
of
general
jackson
and
then
the
beginning
of
its
decline
under
the
withering
touch
of
martin
van
buren
he
advocated
prison
reform
advised
the
people
of
the
south
to
petition
their
respective
legislatures
to
abolish
slavery
by
the
year
or
now
and
save
the
abolitionist
from
reproach
and
ruin
infamy
and
shame
he
recommended
the
payment
of
a
reasonable
price
to
the
of
the
south
for
their
slaves
to
be
paid
by
the
surplus
revenue
arising
from
the
sale
of
public
lands
and
reduction
in
the
wages
paid
to
the
southern
people
said
he
are
hospitable
and
noble
they
will
help
to
rid
so
free
a
country
of
every
vestige
of
slavery
whenever
they
are
assured
of
an
equivalent
for
their
property
he
recommended
more
economy
in
the
national
and
state
governments
and
more
equality
among
the
people
for
the
accommodation
of
the
people
he
proposed
the
establishment
of
a
national
bank
with
branches
in
each
state
the
directors
thereof
to
be
elected
yearly
by
the
people
and
the
profits
arising
from
the
business
to
be
used
as
revenue
in
defraying
the
expenses
of
government
the
profits
from
the
branch
banks
being
used
in
the
respective
states
where
they
existed
and
those
arising
from
the
parent
institution
by
the
general
government
and
reduce
taxation
to
the
extent
of
the
net
profits
of
these
institutions
in
the
light
of
the
experience
he
and
the
saints
had
passed
through
in
missouri
he
advocated
the
idea
of
giving
the
president
full
power
to
send
an
army
to
suppress
mobs
and
appealed
to
the
states
to
repeal
that
relic
of
folly
which
made
it
necessary
for
the
governor
of
a
state
to
make
a
demand
of
the
president
for
troops
in
case
of
invasion
or
rebellion
the
governor
himself
he
goes
on
to
say
may
be
a
mobber
and
instead
of
being
punished
as
he
should
be
for
murder
or
treason
he
may
destroy
the
very
lives
rights
and
property
he
should
protect
he
favored
the
annexation
of
texas
and
the
extension
of
the
authority
of
the
united
states
over
contiguous
territory
on
the
west
and
said
when
a
neighboring
realm
petitioned
to
join
the
union
of
the
sons
of
liberty
my
voice
would
be
yea
come
texas
come
mexico
come
canada
and
come
all
the
world
let
us
be
brethren
let
us
be
one
great
family
and
let
there
be
a
universal
peace
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
a
state
convention
was
held
at
nauvoo
which
ratified
the
views
of
joseph
on
the
powers
and
policy
of
the
government
passed
a
series
of
resolutions
inviting
all
men
of
all
parties
to
assist
in
the
work
of
reforming
the
government
and
in
a
formal
manner
putting
in
nomination
general
joseph
smith
for
president
of
the
united
states
and
sidney
rigdon
for
james
arlington
bennett
of
new
york
was
asked
to
take
the
second
place
on
the
ticket
first
but
he
being
of
foreign
birth
was
not
eligible
then
the
position
was
offered
to
colonel
solomon
copeland
but
for
some
reason
he
did
not
accept
so
the
next
choice
was
sidney
rigdon
who
by
that
time
had
removed
from
nauvoo
to
pennsylvania
arrangements
were
entered
into
to
hold
a
national
convention
in
new
york
on
the
thirteenth
of
july
following
and
preparations
were
made
for
an
active
campaign
in
favor
of
the
but
before
the
time
for
the
national
convention
had
arrived
the
standard
bearer
of
the
new
party
of
reform
jeffersonian
democracy
free
trade
and
sailors
rights
fell
pierced
by
assassins
bullets
the
victim
of
a
cruel
mob
of
course
joseph
had
no
hope
that
he
would
be
elected
to
the
presidency
but
by
becoming
a
candidate
he
gave
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
an
opportunity
to
act
consistently
with
their
views
of
what
ought
to
be
done
for
the
general
good
of
the
nation
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
the
wrath
of
the
political
parties
in
the
state
of
illinois
by
affiliating
with
neither
of
them
in
the
ensuing
election
for
whenever
they
voted
with
one
of
those
parties
the
other
became
enraged
and
doubtless
the
best
reasons
for
and
the
best
justification
of
this
movement
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
is
to
be
found
in
an
editorial
article
from
the
and
for
february
with
which
i
close
this
chapter
who
shall
be
our
next
president
this
is
an
inquiry
which
to
us
as
a
people
is
a
matter
of
the
most
paramount
importance
and
requires
our
most
serious
calm
and
dispassionate
reflection
executive
power
when
correctly
wielded
is
a
great
blessing
to
the
people
of
this
great
commonwealth
and
forms
one
of
the
firmest
pillars
of
our
confederation
it
watches
the
interests
of
the
whole
community
with
a
fatherly
care
it
wisely
balances
the
other
legislative
powers
when
overheated
by
party
spirit
or
sectional
feeling
it
watches
with
jealous
care
our
interests
and
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
gives
tone
and
efficacy
to
legislative
enactments
the
president
stands
at
the
head
of
these
united
states
and
is
the
of
this
vast
republic
if
he
be
a
man
of
an
enlightened
mind
and
a
capacious
soul
if
he
be
a
virtuous
man
a
statesman
a
patriot
and
a
man
of
unflinching
integrity
if
he
possess
the
same
spirit
that
fired
the
souls
of
our
venerable
sires
who
founded
this
great
commonwealth
and
wishes
to
promote
the
universal
good
of
the
whole
republic
he
may
indeed
be
made
a
blessing
to
the
community
but
if
he
prostrates
his
high
and
honorable
calling
to
base
and
unworthy
purposes
if
he
makes
use
of
the
power
which
the
people
have
placed
in
his
hands
for
their
interests
to
gratify
his
ambition
for
the
purpose
of
or
pecuniary
interest
if
he
meanly
panders
with
demagogues
loses
sight
of
the
interest
of
the
nation
and
sacrifices
the
union
on
the
altar
of
sectional
interests
or
party
views
he
renders
himself
unworthy
of
the
dignified
trust
reposed
in
him
debases
the
nation
in
the
eyes
of
the
civilized
world
and
produces
misery
and
confusion
at
home
when
the
wicked
rule
the
people
mourn
there
is
perhaps
no
body
of
people
in
the
united
states
who
are
at
the
present
time
more
interested
about
the
issue
of
the
presidential
contest
than
are
the
saints
and
our
situation
in
regard
to
the
two
great
political
parties
is
a
most
novel
one
it
is
a
fact
well
understood
that
we
have
suffered
great
injustice
from
the
state
of
missouri
that
we
petitioned
to
the
authorities
of
that
state
for
redress
in
vain
that
we
have
also
memorialized
congress
under
the
late
administration
and
have
obtained
the
heartless
reply
that
congress
has
no
power
to
redress
your
grievances
after
having
taken
all
the
legal
and
constitutional
steps
that
we
can
we
are
still
groaning
under
accumulated
wrongs
is
there
no
power
anywhere
to
redress
our
grievances
missouri
lacks
the
disposition
and
congress
lacks
both
the
disposition
and
power
and
thus
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
of
these
united
states
can
with
impunity
be
dispossessed
of
their
property
have
their
houses
burned
their
property
confiscated
many
of
their
numbers
murdered
and
the
remainder
driven
from
their
homes
and
left
to
wander
as
exiles
in
this
boasted
land
of
freedom
and
equal
rights
and
after
appealing
again
and
again
to
the
legally
constituted
authorities
of
our
land
for
redress
we
are
coolly
told
by
our
highest
tribunals
we
can
do
nothing
for
you
we
have
paid
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
into
the
coffers
of
congress
for
their
lands
and
they
stand
virtually
pledged
to
defend
us
in
our
rights
but
they
have
not
done
it
if
a
man
steals
a
dollar
from
his
neighbor
or
steals
a
horse
or
a
hog
he
can
obtain
redress
but
we
have
been
robbed
by
wholesale
the
most
daring
murders
have
been
committed
and
we
are
coolly
told
that
we
can
obtain
no
redress
if
a
steamboat
is
set
on
fire
on
our
coast
by
foreigners
even
when
she
is
engaged
in
aiding
and
abetting
the
enemies
of
that
power
it
becomes
a
matter
of
national
interference
and
legislation
or
if
a
foreigner
as
in
the
case
of
mcleod
is
taken
on
our
land
and
tried
for
supposed
crimes
committed
by
him
against
our
citizens
his
nation
interferes
and
it
becomes
a
matter
of
negotiation
and
legislation
but
our
authorities
can
calmly
look
on
and
see
the
citizens
of
a
country
butchered
with
impunity
they
can
see
two
counties
dispossessed
of
their
inhabitants
their
houses
burned
and
their
property
confiscated
and
when
the
crys
of
fifteen
thousand
men
women
and
children
salute
their
ears
they
deliberately
tell
us
that
we
can
obtain
no
redress
hear
it
therefore
ye
mobbers
proclaim
it
to
all
the
scoundrels
in
the
union
let
a
standard
be
erected
around
which
shall
rally
all
the
renegadoes
of
the
land
assemble
yourselves
and
rob
at
pleasure
murder
till
you
are
satisfied
with
blood
drive
men
women
and
children
from
their
homes
there
is
no
law
to
protect
them
and
congress
has
no
power
to
redress
their
grievances
and
the
great
father
of
the
union
the
president
has
not
got
an
ear
to
listen
to
their
complaints
what
shall
we
do
under
this
state
of
things
in
the
event
of
either
of
the
prominent
candidates
van
buren
or
clay
obtaining
the
presidential
chair
we
should
not
be
placed
in
any
better
situation
in
speaking
of
clay
his
politics
are
diametrically
opposed
to
ours
he
inclines
strongly
to
the
old
school
of
federalists
and
as
a
matter
of
course
would
not
favor
our
cause
neither
could
we
conscientiously
vote
for
him
and
we
have
yet
stronger
objections
to
van
buren
on
other
grounds
he
has
sung
the
old
song
of
congress
congress
has
no
power
to
redress
your
grievances
but
did
the
matter
rest
here
it
would
not
be
so
bad
he
was
in
the
presidential
chair
at
the
time
of
our
former
difficulties
we
appealed
to
him
on
that
occasion
but
we
appealed
in
vain
and
his
sentiments
are
yet
unchanged
but
all
these
thing
are
tolerable
in
comparison
to
what
we
have
yet
to
state
we
have
been
informed
from
a
respectable
source
that
there
is
an
understanding
between
benton
of
missouri
and
van
buren
and
a
conditional
compact
entered
into
that
if
benton
will
use
his
influence
to
get
van
buren
elected
van
buren
when
elected
shall
use
his
executive
influence
to
wipe
away
the
stain
from
missouri
by
a
further
persecution
of
the
mormons
and
wreaking
out
vengeance
on
their
heads
either
by
extermination
or
by
some
other
summary
process
we
could
scarcely
credit
the
statement
and
we
hope
yet
for
the
sake
of
humanity
that
the
suggestion
is
false
but
we
have
too
good
reason
to
believe
that
we
are
correctly
informed
if
then
this
is
the
case
can
we
conscientiously
vote
for
a
man
of
this
description
and
put
the
weapon
in
his
hands
to
cut
our
throats
with
we
can
not
and
however
much
we
might
wish
to
sustain
the
democratic
nomination
we
can
not
we
will
not
vote
for
van
buren
our
interests
our
property
our
lives
and
the
lives
of
our
families
are
too
dear
to
us
to
be
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
of
party
spirit
and
to
gratify
party
feelings
we
have
been
sold
once
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
our
liberties
bartered
away
by
political
demagogues
through
executive
intrigue
and
we
wish
not
to
be
betrayed
again
by
benton
and
van
buren
under
these
circumstances
the
question
again
arises
whom
shall
we
support
general
joseph
smith
a
man
of
sterling
worth
and
integrity
and
of
enlarged
views
a
man
who
has
raised
himself
from
the
humblest
walks
in
life
to
stand
at
the
head
of
a
large
intelligent
respectable
and
increasing
society
that
has
spread
not
only
in
this
land
but
in
distant
nations
a
man
whose
talents
and
genius
are
of
an
exalted
nature
and
whose
experience
has
rendered
him
in
every
way
adequate
to
the
onerous
duty
honorable
fearless
and
energetic
he
would
administer
justice
with
an
impartial
hand
and
magnify
and
dignify
the
office
of
chief
magistrate
of
this
land
and
we
feel
assured
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
united
states
more
competent
for
the
task
one
great
reason
that
we
have
for
pursuing
our
present
course
is
that
at
every
election
we
have
been
made
a
political
target
for
the
filthy
demagogues
in
the
country
to
shoot
their
loathsome
arrows
at
and
every
story
has
been
put
into
requisition
to
blast
our
fame
from
the
old
fabrication
of
walk
on
the
water
down
to
the
murder
of
boggs
the
journals
have
teemed
with
this
filthy
trash
and
even
men
who
ought
to
have
more
respect
for
themselves
men
contending
for
the
gubernatorial
chair
have
made
use
of
terms
so
degrading
so
mean
so
humiliating
that
a
billingsgate
fisherwoman
would
have
considered
herself
disgraced
with
we
refuse
any
longer
to
be
thus
bedaubed
for
either
party
we
tell
all
such
to
let
their
filth
flow
in
its
own
legitimate
channel
for
we
are
sick
of
the
loathsome
smell
gentlemen
we
are
not
going
either
to
murder
boggs
nor
a
mormon
in
this
state
for
not
giving
us
his
money
nor
are
we
going
to
walk
on
the
water
nor
drown
a
woman
nor
defraud
the
poor
of
their
property
nor
send
destroying
angels
after
general
bennett
to
kill
him
nor
marry
spiritual
wives
nor
commit
any
other
outrageous
act
this
election
to
help
any
party
with
you
must
get
some
other
persons
to
perform
these
kind
offices
for
you
for
the
future
we
withdraw
under
existing
circumstances
we
have
no
other
alternative
and
if
we
can
accomplish
our
object
well
if
not
we
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
we
have
acted
conscientiously
and
have
used
our
best
judgment
and
if
we
have
to
throw
away
our
votes
we
had
better
do
so
upon
a
worthy
rather
than
upon
an
unworthy
individual
who
might
make
use
of
the
weapon
we
put
in
his
hand
to
destroy
us
with
whatever
may
be
the
opinions
of
men
in
general
in
regard
to
smith
we
know
that
he
needs
only
to
be
known
to
be
admired
and
that
it
is
the
principles
of
honor
integrity
patriotism
and
philanthropy
that
have
elevated
him
in
the
minds
of
his
friends
and
the
same
principles
if
seen
and
known
would
beget
the
esteem
and
confidence
of
all
the
patriotic
and
virtuous
throughout
the
union
whatever
therefore
be
the
opinions
of
other
men
our
course
is
marked
out
and
our
motto
from
henceforth
will
be
general

of
the
united
states
at
the
ensuing
election
chapter
xxxiv
the
projected
movement
to
the
west
as
an
evidence
that
the
prophet
entertained
no
thought
of
success
in
his
candidacy
for
the
office
of
chief
executive
we
may
mention
the
fact
that
during
the
time
that
vigorous
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
presidential
canvass
he
was
setting
on
foot
a
scheme
for
taking
the
body
of
the
church
into
the
west
to
settle
oregon
on
the
twentieth
of
february
the
prophet
in
his
journal
says
i
instructed
the
twelve
apostles
to
send
out
a
delegation
and
investigate
the
location
of
california
and
oregon
and
hunt
out
a
good
location
where
we
can
remove
to
after
the
temple
is
completed
and
where
we
can
build
a
city
in
a
day
and
have
a
government
of
our
own
get
up
into
the
mountains
where
the
devil
can
not
dig
us
out
and
live
in
a
healthy
climate
where
we
can
live
as
old
as
we
have
a
mind
too
in
accordance
with
that
instruction
the
twelve
called
the
council
on
the
and
jonathan
dunham
phinehas
young
and
david
fullmer
volunteered
to
go
and
alphonzo
young
james
emmett
george
watt
and
daniel
spencer
were
called
to
go
subsequently
a
memorial
was
drawn
up
by
the
prophet
asking
congress
to
pass
an
enactment
authorizing
him
to
raise
a
company
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
colonies
in
that
vast
unsettled
section
of
the
country
in
the
far
west
known
under
the
general
name
of
oregon
at
that
time
there
was
no
particular
government
existing
in
the
region
to
which
the
names
oregon
and
california
were
loosely
given
nor
was
it
certain
whether
that
country
would
fall
into
the
possession
of
england
or
the
united
states
as
the
northern
boundary
line
question
was
then
unsettled
and
england
and
the
united
states
held
the
country
by
a
treaty
of
joint
occupancy
as
the
prophet
preferred
having
an
assurance
of
protection
from
the
government
on
his
enterprise
he
asked
congress
to
pass
the
act
before
alluded
to
orson
pratt
and
john
page
two
of
the
twelve
went
to
washington
in
the
interest
of
this
scheme
and
urged
its
consideration
among
the
congressmen
subsequently
in
april
orson
hyde
was
sent
to
washington
in
the
interest
of
the
same
great
project
and
through
the
influence
of
hoge
representative
to
congress
from
the
district
in
which
nauvoo
was
included
hardin
and
stephen
douglass
succeeded
in
approaching
a
number
of
members
of
congress
on
the
subject
but
received
small
encouragement
as
congressmen
then
as
now
were
extremely
cautions
in
engaging
in
anything
affecting
their
reputation
and
prospects
for
political
preferment
for
the
future
but
however
much
these
men
objected
to
advocating
anything
which
looked
like
favoring
openly
the
scheme
of
the
prophet
they
all
concurred
in
affirming
that
he
had
the
right
to
lead
his
people
to
oregon
to
settle
and
the
government
would
protect
them
stephen
douglass
remarked
that
if
he
could
command
the
following
that
smith
could
he
would
resign
his
seat
in
congress
to
go
to
the
west
on
this
subject
orson
hyde
made
two
exhaustive
reports
to
the
prophet
in
letters
from
washington
which
i
here
insert
washington
april
hon
sir
i
take
the
liberty
to
transmit
through
you
to
the
council
of
our
church
the
result
of
my
labors
thus
far
i
arrived
in
this
place
on
the
instant
by
way
of
pittsburgh
philadelphia
and
new
jersey
i
found
elder
orson
pratt
here
elder
page
having
been
called
home
to
pittsburgh
on
account
of
his
wife
ill
health
elder
pratt
has
been
indefatigable
in
his
exertions
in
prosecuting
the
business
entrusted
to
his
charge
his
business
has
been
before
the
senate
and
referred
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
and
the
report
of
said
committee
is
not
yet
rendered
which
is
the
cause
of
his
delay
in
writing
to
you
yesterday
we
conversed
with
hoge
hardin
douglass
and
wentworth
and
last
evening
we
spent
several
hours
with
the
hon
semple
they
all
appear
deeply
interested
in
the
oregon
question
and
received
us
with
every
demonstration
of
respect
that
we
could
desire
hoge
thought
that
the
bill
would
not
pass
from
the
fact
that
there
already
exists
between
england
and
america
a
treaty
for
the
joint
occupancy
of
oregon
and
that
any
act
of
our
government
authorizing
an
armed
force
to
be
raised
and
destined
for
that
country
would
be
regarded
by
england
as
an
infraction
of
that
treaty
and
a
cause
of
her
commencing
hostilities
against
us
but
my
reply
was
these
volunteers
are
not
to
be
considered
any
part
or
portion
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
neither
acting
under
the
direction
or
authority
of
the
united
states
and
said
i
for
men
to
go
there
and
settle
in
the
character
of
emigrants
can
not
be
regarded
by
our
government
as
deviating
in
the
least
degree
from
her
plighted
faith
unless
she
intends
to
tamely
submit
to
british
monopoly
in
that
country
said
he
would
present
the
memorial
if
we
desired
it
i
thanked
him
for
his
kind
offer
but
observed
that
i
was
not
yet
prepared
for
the
bill
to
be
submitted
but
wished
to
elicit
all
the
facts
relative
to
the
condition
of
oregon
and
also
advise
with
many
other
members
relative
to
the
matter
and
we
could
better
determine
then
how
the
bill
should
be
introduced
we
do
not
want
it
presented
and
referred
to
a
standing
committee
and
stuck
away
with
five
or
ten
cords
of
petitions
and
that
be
the
last
of
it
but
we
want
the
memorial
read
a
move
made
to
suspend
the
rules
of
the
house
and
the
bill
printed
etc
wentworth
said
i
am
for
oregon
anyhow
you
may
set
me
down
on
your
list
and
i
will
go
for
you
if
you
will
go
for
oregon
judge
douglass
has
been
quite
ill
but
is
just
recovered
he
will
help
all
he
can
hardin
likewise
but
major
semple
says
that
he
does
not
believe
anything
will
be
done
about
texas
or
oregon
this
session
for
it
might
have
a
very
important
effect
upon
the
presidential
election
and
politicians
are
slow
to
move
when
such
doubtful
and
important
matters
are
likely
to
be
affected
by
it
he
says
that
there
are
already
two
bills
before
the
house
for
establishing
a
territorial
government
in
oregon
and
to
protect
the
emigrants
there
and
now
he
says
were
your
bill
to
be
introduced
it
might
be
looked
upon
that
you
claimed
the
sole
right
of
emigrating
to
and
settling
that
new
country
to
the
exclusion
of
others
he
was
in
favor
of
the
oregon
being
settled
and
he
thought
the
bills
already
before
the
house
would
extend
equal
protection
to
us
and
equal
protection
to
every
class
of
citizens
was
what
the
government
could
rightly
do
but
particular
privileges
to
any
one
class
they
could
not
rightly
do
i
observed
that
the
bill
asked
for
no
exclusive
rights
it
asks
not
for
exclusive
rights
in
oregon
neither
do
we
wish
it
other
people
might
make
a
move
to
oregon
and
no
prejudices
bar
their
way
and
their
motives
would
not
be
misinterpreted
but
said
i
missouri
knows
her
guilt
and
should
we
attempt
to
march
to
oregon
without
the
government
throwing
a
protective
shield
over
us
missouri
crimes
would
lead
her
first
to
misinterpret
our
intentions
to
fan
the
flame
of
popular
excitement
against
us
and
scatter
the
firebrands
of
a
misguided
zeal
among
the
combustible
materials
of
other
places
creating
a
flame
too
hot
for
us
to
encounter
too
desolating
for
us
to
indulge
the
hope
of
successfully
prosecuting
the
grand
and
benevolent
enterprise
we
have
conceived
we
have
been
compelled
to
relinquish
our
rights
in
missouri
we
have
been
forcibly
driven
from
our
homes
leaving
our
property
and
inheritances
as
spoil
to
the
oppressor
and
more
or
less
in
illinois
we
have
been
subject
to
the
whims
and
chimeras
of
illiberal
men
and
to
threats
to
vexatious
prosecutions
and
lawsuits
our
government
professes
to
have
no
power
to
help
us
or
to
redress
the
wrongs
which
we
have
suffered
and
we
now
ask
the
government
to
protect
us
while
raising
our
volunteers
and
when
we
get
into
oregon
we
will
protect
ourselves
and
all
others
who
wish
our
protection
and
after
subduing
a
new
country
encountering
all
its
difficulties
and
hardships
and
sustaining
the
just
claims
of
our
nation
to
its
soil
we
believe
that
the
generosity
of
our
government
towards
us
will
be
equal
to
our
enterprise
and
patriotism
and
that
they
will
allow
us
a
grant
or
territory
of
land
which
will
be
both
honorable
in
them
and
satisfactory
to
us
this
he
says
is
all
very
just
and
reasonable
but
still
he
thinks
that
congress
will
take
no
step
in
relation
to
oregon
from
the
fact
that
his
resolution
requesting
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
give
notice
to
the
british
government
for
the
abolition
of
the
treaty
of
joint
occupation
was
voted
down
and
while
that
treaty
is
in
force
our
government
dare
do
nothing
in
relation
to
that
country
this
resolution
was
introduced
by
semple
to
pave
the
way
for
the
passage
of
those
bills
in
relation
to
a
territorial
government
in
oregon
all
our
members
join
in
the
acknowledgement
that
you
have
an
undoubted
right
to
go
to
oregon
with
all
the
emigrants
you
can
raise
they
say
the
existing
laws
protect
you
as
much
as
law
can
protect
you
and
should
congress
pass
an
additional
law
it
would
not
prevent
wicked
men
from
shooting
you
down
as
they
did
in
missouri
all
the
oregon
men
in
congress
would
be
glad
if
we
would
go
to
that
country
and
settle
it
i
will
now
give
you
my
opinion
in
relation
to
this
matter
it
is
made
up
from
the
spirit
of
the
times
in
a
hasty
manner
nevertheless
i
think
time
will
prove
it
correct
that
congress
will
pass
not
act
in
relation
to
texas
or
oregon
at
present
she
is
afraid
of
england
afraid
of
mexico
afraid
the
presidential
election
will
be
twisted
by
it
the
members
all
appear
like
unskillful
players
at
checkers
afraid
to
move
for
they
see
not
which
way
to
move
advantageously
all
are
figuring
and
playing
round
the
grand
and
important
questions
in
the
days
of
our
lord
the
people
neglected
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
but
tithed
mint
rue
anise
and
cummin
but
i
think
here
in
washington
they
do
little
else
than
tithe
the
a
member
of
congress
is
in
no
enviable
situation
if
he
will
boldly
advocate
true
principles
he
loses
his
influence
and
becomes
unpopular
and
whoever
is
committed
and
has
lost
his
influence
has
no
power
to
benefit
his
constituents
so
that
all
go
to
figuring
and
playing
round
the
great
points
semple
said
that
smith
could
not
constitutionally
be
constituted
a
member
of
the
army
by
law
and
this
if
nothing
else
would
prevent
its
passage
i
observed
that
i
would
in
that
case
strike
out
that
clause
perhaps
i
took
an
unwarrantable
responsibility
upon
myself
but
where
i
get
into
a
straight
place
i
can
do
no
better
than
act
according
to
what
appears
most
correct
i
do
not
intend
the
opinion
that
i
have
hastily
given
shall
abate
my
zeal
to
drive
the
matter
through
but
i
have
given
the
opinion
for
your
benefit
that
your
indulgence
of
the
hope
that
congress
will
do
something
for
us
may
not
cause
you
to
delay
any
important
action
there
is
already
a
government
established
in
oregon
to
some
extent
magistrates
have
been
chosen
by
the
people
this
is
on
the
south
of
the
columbia
north
of
that
river
the
hudson
bay
company
occupy
there
is
some
good
country
in
oregon
but
a
great
deal
of
sandy
barren
desert
i
have
seen
a
gentleman
who
has
been
there
and
also
in
california
the
most
of
the
settlers
in
oregon
and
texas
are
our
old
enemies
the
mobocrats
of
missouri
if
however
the
settlement
of
oregon
and
texas
be
determined
upon
the
sooner
the
move
is
made
the
better
and
i
would
not
advise
any
delay
for
the
action
of
our
government
for
there
is
such
a
jealousy
of
our
rising
power
already
that
government
will
do
nothing
to
favor
us
if
the
saints
possess
the
kingdom
i
think
they
will
have
to
take
it
and
the
sooner
it
is
done
the
more
easily
it
is
accomplished
your
superior
wisdom
must
determine
whether
to
go
to
oregon
to
texas
or
to
remain
within
these
united
states
and
send
forth
the
most
efficient
men
to
build
up
churches
and
let
them
remain
for
the
time
being
and
in
the
meantime
send
some
men
among
the
indians
and
teach
them
civilization
and
religion
to
cultivate
the
soil
to
live
in
peace
with
one
another
and
with
all
men
but
whatever
you
do
do
be
deluded
with
the
hope
that
government
will
foster
us
and
thus
delay
an
action
which
the
present
is
the
most
proper
time
that
ever
will
be
in
which
to
accomplish
r
oregon
is
becoming
a
popular
question
the
fever
of
emigration
begins
to
rage
if
the
mormons
become
the
early
majority
others
will
not
come
if
the
mormons
do
not
become
an
early
majority
the
others
will
not
allow
us
to
come
elder
pratt
is
faithful
useful
and
true
he
has
got
the
run
of
matters
here
very
well
and
is
with
me
in
all
my
deliberations
visitings
major
semple
goes
with
us
this
evening
to
introduce
us
to
the
president
and
to
view
the
white
house
my
heart
and
hand
are
with
you
may
heaven
bless
you
and
me
as
ever
i
am
orson
hyde
to
the
council
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
also
the
following
letter
washington
april
dear
sir
today
i
trouble
you
with
another
communication
which
you
will
please
have
the
goodness
to
lay
before
our
council
we
were
last
evening
introduced
to
the
president
at
the
white
house
by
the
politeness
of
major
semple
where
we
spent
an
hour
very
agreeably
the
president
is
a
very
plain
homespun
familiar
man
he
spoke
of
our
troubles
in
missouri
and
regretted
that
we
had
met
with
such
treatment
he
asked
us
how
we
were
getting
along
in
illinois
i
told
him
that
we
were
contending
with
the
difficulties
of
a
new
country
and
laboring
under
the
disadvantageous
consequences
of
being
driven
from
our
property
and
homes
in
missouri
we
have
this
day
had
a
long
conversation
with
judge
douglass
he
is
ripe
for
oregon
and
the
california
he
said
he
would
resign
his
seat
in
congress
if
he
could
command
the
force
that
smith
could
and
would
be
on
the
march
to
that
country
in
a
month
i
learn
that
the
eyes
of
many
aspiring
politicians
in
this
place
are
now
upon
that
country
and
that
there
is
so
much
jealousy
between
them
that
they
will
probably
pass
no
bill
in
relation
to
it
now
all
these
politicians
rely
upon
the
arm
of
our
government
to
protect
them
there
and
if
government
were
to
pass
an
act
establishing
a
territorial
government
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
there
would
be
at
once
a
tremendous
rush
of
emigration
but
if
government
pass
no
act
in
relation
to
it
these
men
have
not
stamina
or
sufficient
confidence
in
themselves
and
their
own
resources
to
hazard
the
enterprise
the
northern
whig
members
are
almost
to
a
man
against
texas
and
oregon
but
should
the
present
administration
succeed
in
annexing
texas
then
all
the
whigs
would
turn
round
in
favor
of
oregon
for
if
texas
be
admitted
slavery
is
extended
to
the
south
then
free
states
must
be
added
to
the
west
to
keep
up
a
balance
of
power
between
the
slave
and
the
free
states
should
texas
be
admitted
war
with
mexico
is
looked
upon
as
inevitable
the
senate
have
been
in
secret
session
on
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
of
annexation
but
what
they
did
we
can
not
say
general
gaines
who
was
boarding
at
the
same
house
with
judge
douglass
was
secretly
ordered
to
repair
to
the
texan
frontier
four
days
ago
and
left
immediately
i
asked
judge
if
he
did
not
speak
loud
for
annexation
he
says
no
santa
anna
being
a
jealous
pate
might
be
suspicious
the
treaty
would
be
ratified
by
the
senate
and
upon
mere
suspicion
might
attempt
some
hostilities
and
gaines
had
been
ordered
there
to
be
on
the
alert
and
ready
for
action
if
necessary
probably
our
navy
will
in
a
few
days
be
mostly
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
there
are
many
powerful
checks
upon
our
government
preventing
her
from
moving
in
any
of
these
important
matters
and
for
aught
i
know
these
checks
are
permitted
to
prevent
our
government
from
extending
her
jurisdiction
over
that
territory
which
god
designs
to
give
to
his
saints
judge
douglass
says
he
would
equally
as
soon
go
to
that
country
without
an
act
of
congress
as
with
that
in
five
years
a
noble
state
might
be
formed
and
then
if
they
would
not
receive
us
into
the
union
we
would
have
a
government
of
our
own
he
is
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
congress
will
pass
no
act
in
favor
of
any
particular
man
going
there
but
he
says
if
any
man
will
go
and
desires
that
privilege
and
has
confidence
in
his
own
ability
to
perform
it
he
already
has
the
right
and
the
sooner
he
is
off
the
better
for
his
scheme
it
is
the
opinion
here
among
politicians
that
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
to
have
any
bill
pass
in
relation
to
the
encouragement
of
emigration
to
oregon
but
much
more
difficult
to
get
a
bill
passed
designating
any
particular
man
to
go
but
all
concur
in
the
opinion
that
we
are
authorized
already
in
case
of
a
removal
to
that
country
nauvoo
is
the
place
of
general
rendezvous
our
course
from
thence
would
be
westward
through
iowa
bearing
a
little
north
until
we
came
to
the
missouri
river
leaving
the
state
of
missouri
on
the
left
thence
onward
till
we
come
to
the
platte
thence
up
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
to
the
mouth
of
sweetwater
river
in
longitude
and
thence
up
said
sweetwater
river
to
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
about
eleven
hundred
miles
from
nauvoo
and
from
said
south
pass
in
latitude
north
to
the
umpaque
and
klamet
valleys
in
oregon
bordering
on
california
is
about
miles
making
the
distance
from
nauvoo
to
the
best
portions
of
oregon
miles
there
is
no
government
established
there
and
it
is
so
near
california
that
when
a
government
shall
be
established
there
it
may
readily
embrace
that
country
likewise
there
is
much
barren
country
rocks
and
mountains
in
oregon
but
the
valleys
are
very
fertile
i
am
persuaded
that
congress
will
pass
no
act
in
relation
to
that
country
from
the
fact
that
the
resolution
requesting
the
president
to
give
notice
to
the
british
government
for
the
discontinuance
of
the
treaty
of
joint
occupation
of
oregon
was
voted
down
with
a
rush
and
this
notice
must
be
given
before
any
action
can
be
had
unless
congress
violates
the
treaty
at
least
so
say
the
politicians
here
judge
douglass
has
given
me
a
map
of
oregon
and
also
a
report
on
an
exploration
of
the
country
lying
between
the
missouri
river
and
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
line
of
the
kansas
and
great
platte
rivers
by
lieutenant
fremont
of
the
corps
of
topographical
engineers
on
receiving
it
i
expressed
a
wish
that
smith
could
see
it
judge
says
it
is
a
public
document
and
i
will
frank
it
to
him
i
accepted
his
offer
and
the
book
will
be
forthcoming
to
him
the
people
are
so
eager
for
it
here
that
they
have
even
stolen
it
out
of
the
library
the
author
is
benton
judge
borrowed
it
of
i
was
not
to
tell
anyone
in
this
city
where
i
got
it
the
book
is
a
most
valuable
document
to
any
one
contemplating
a
journey
to
oregon
the
directions
which
i
have
given
may
not
be
exactly
correct
but
the
book
will
tell
correctly
judge
says
he
can
direct
smith
to
several
gentlemen
in
california
who
will
be
able
to
give
him
any
information
on
the
state
of
affairs
in
that
country
and
when
he
returns
to
illinois
he
will
visit
smith
brother
pratt
and
myself
drafted
a
bill
this
morning
and
handed
it
in
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
from
the
senate
asking
an
appropriation
of
two
million
dollars
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
among
our
people
in
missouri
in
to
be
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
city
council
of
nauvoo
and
by
them
dealt
out
to
the
sufferers
in
proportion
to
their
loss
we
intend
to
tease
them
until
we
either
provoke
them
or
get
them
to
do
something
for
us
i
have
learned
this
much
that
if
we
want
congress
to
do
anything
for
us
in
drawing
up
our
memorial
we
must
not
ask
what
is
right
in
the
matter
but
we
must
ask
what
kind
of
a
thing
will
congress
pass
will
it
suit
the
politics
of
the
majority
will
it
be
popular
or
unpopular
for
you
might
as
well
drive
a
musket
ball
through
a
cotton
bag
or
the
gospel
of
christ
through
the
heart
of
a
priest
by
sectarianism
bigotry
and
superstition
or
a
camel
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
as
to
drive
anything
through
congress
that
will
operate
against
the
popularity
of
politicians
i
shall
probably
leave
here
in
a
few
days
and
brother
pratt
will
remain
i
go
to
get
money
to
sustain
ourselves
with
i
shall
write
again
soon
and
let
you
know
what
restrictions
if
any
are
laid
upon
our
citizens
in
relation
to
passing
through
the
indian
territories
i
shall
communicate
everything
i
think
will
benefit
in
the
meantime
if
the
council
have
any
instructions
to
us
we
shall
be
happy
to
receive
them
here
or
at
philadelphia
john
ross
is
here
we
intend
to
see
him
it
is
uncertain
when
congress
rises
it
will
be
a
long
pull
in
my
opinion
as
ever
i
am
yours
sincerely
orson
hyde
elder

best
respects
to
the
brethren
an
event
soon
afterwards
took
place
in
the
house
of
representatives
before
the
prophet
petition
was
introduced
which
put
at
rest
all
hopes
of
congress
doing
anything
at
that
time
in
relation
to
the
oregon
territory
a
resolution
was
introduced
giving
great
britain
notice
that
the
treaty
of
joint
occupancy
of
that
country
was
at
an
end
but
it
was
promptly
voted
down
that
virtually
served
public
notice
that
the
oregon
question
was
not
to
be
reopened
by
congress
at
least
not
until
the
conclusion
of
the
presidential
election
sufficient
may
be
gathered
from
what
is
set
down
in
the
above
to
prove
that
the
mind
of
the
prophet
joseph
was
bent
on
establishing
his
people
in
the
west
somewhere
in
the
rocky
mountains
so
soon
as
they
could
complete
the
temple
the
subject
began
to
take
possession
of
his
mind
wholly
some
eighteen
months
before
his
formal
appeal
to
congress
for
the
privilege
of
settling
with
his
people
in
the
far
west
under
the
protecting
aegis
of
the
general
government
on
the
sixth
of
august
he
prophesied
that
his
people
would
continue
to
suffer
much
persecution
and
at
last
be
driven
to
the
rocky
mountains
this
is
the
prophecy
as
it
stands
in
the
prophet
journal
saturday
sixth
august
passed
over
the
river
to
montrose
iowa
in
company
with
general
adams
colonel
brewer
and
others
and
witnessed
the
installation
of
the
officers
of
the
rising
sun
lodge
of
ancient
york
masons
at
montrose
by
general
james
adams
deputy
grand
master
of
illinois
while
the
deputy
grand
master
was
engaged
in
giving
the
requisite
instruction
to
the
master
elect
i
had
a
conversation
with
a
number
of
brethren
in
the
shade
of
the
building
on
the
subject
of
our
persecutions
in
missouri
and
the
constant
annoyance
which
has
followed
us
since
we
were
driven
from
that
state
i
prophesied
that
the
saints
would
continue
to
suffer
much
affliction
and
would
be
driven
to
the
rocky
mountains
many
would
apostatize
others
would
be
put
to
death
by
our
persecutors
or
lose
their
lives
in
consequence
of
exposure
or
disease
and
some
of
you
will
live
to
go
and
assist
in
making
settlements
and
build
cities
and
see
the
saints
become
a
mighty
people
in
the
midst
of
the
rocky

as
persecution
in
illinois
grew
more
relentless
and
mobocrats
more
bold
until
the
whole
horizon
appeared
black
and
threatening
with
hatred
toward
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
the
prophet
told
them
repeatedly
it
was

meantime
the
people
of
nauvoo
with
the
prophet
as
chief
mover
in
the
matter
sought
to
establish
peaceful
relations
with
their
neighbors
armed
conflict
with
surrounding
peoples
or
with
any
people
was
no
part
of
the
policy
of
joseph
smith
and
no
part
of
the
work
that
he
had
in
hand
it
is
true
that
it
may
be
said
of
the
work
he
introduced
as
jesus
said
of
the
work
which
he
began
by
his
personal
ministry
that
it
brought
not
peace
but
a
sword
in
each
case
however
the
sword
has
been
found
in
the
hands
not
of
those
who
have
accepted
the
gospel
but
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
rejected
it
and
opposed
it
and
made
war
upon
it
early
in
the
history
of
the
work
brought
forth
by
joseph
smith
the
lord
commanded
his
servants
to
renounce
war
and
proclaim
peace
and
true
to
this
spirit
of
the
work
the
prophet
especially
sought
for
peace
in
the
of
the
of
february
governor
ford
published
the
following
letter
to
the
citizens
of
hancock
county
in
the
hope
evidently
of
quelling
the
threatening
storm
springfield
january
dear
sir
i
have
received
the
copy
of
the
proceedings
and
resolutions
of
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
of
hancock
county
which
you
did
me
the
honour
to
send
me
i
have
observed
with
regret
that
occasions
have
been
presented
for
disturbing
the
peace
of
your
county
and
if
i
knew
what
i
could
legally
do
to
apply
a
corrective
i
would
be
very
ready
to
do
it
but
if
you
are
a
lawyer
or
at
all
conversant
with
the
law
you
will
know
that
i
as
a
governor
have
no
right
to
interfere
in
your
difficulties
as
yet
i
believe
that
there
has
been
nothing
like
war
among
you
and
i
hope
that
all
of
you
will
have
the
good
sense
to
see
the
necessity
of
preserving
peace
if
there
is
anything
wrong
in
the
nauvoo
charters
or
in
the
mode
of
administering
them
you
will
see
that
nothing
short
of
legislative
or
judicial
power
is
capable
of
enforcing
a
remedy
i
myself
had
the
honor
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
legislature
to
this
subject
at
the
last
session
but
a
large
majority
of
both
political
parties
in
that
body
either
did
not
see
the
evil
which
you
complain
of
or
if
they
did
they
repeatedly
refused
to
correct
it
and
yet
a
call
is
made
upon
me
to
do
that
which
all
parties
refused
to
do
at
the
last
session
i
have
also
been
called
upon
to
take
away
the
arms
from
the
to
raise
the
militia
to
arrest
a
supposed
fugitive
and
in
fact
to
repeal
some
of
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
hancock
county
is
justly
famed
for
its
intelligence
and
i
can
not
believe
that
any
of
its
citizens
are
so
ignorant
as
not
to
know
that
i
have
no
power
to
do
these
things
the
absurd
and
preposterous
nature
of
these
requests
gave
some
color
to
the
charge
that
they
are
made
for
political
effect
only
i
hope
that
this
charge
is
untrue
for
in
all
candor
it
would
be
more
creditable
to
those
concerned
to
have
their
errors
attributed
to
ignorance
than
to
a
disposition
to
embroil
the
country
in
the
horrors
of
war
for
the
advancement
of
party
ends
but
if
there
should
be
any
truth
in
the
charge
which
god
forbid
i
affectionately
entreat
all
the
good
citizens
engaged
in
it
to
lay
aside
their
designs
and
yield
up
their
ears
to
the
voice
of
justice
reason
and
humanity
all
that
i
can
do
at
present
is
to
admonish
both
parties
to
beware
of
carrying
matters
to
extremity
let
it
come
to
this
let
a
state
of
war
ensue
and
i
will
be
compelled
to
interfere
with
executive
power
in
that
case
also
i
wish
in
a
friendly
affectionate
and
candid
manner
to
tell
the
citizens
of
hancock
county
and
all
that
my
interference
will
be
against
those
who
shall
be
the
first
transgressors
i
am
bound
by
the
laws
and
constitution
to
regard
you
all
as
citizens
of
the
state
possessed
of
equal
rights
and
privileges
and
to
cherish
the
rights
of
one
as
dearly
as
the
rights
of
another
i
can
know
no
distinction
among
you
except
that
of
assailant
and
assailed
i
hope
dear
sir
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
publish
this
letter
in
the
papers
of
your
county
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
persons
concerned
i
am
with
the
highest
respect
your
obedient
servant
thomas
ford
to
this
letter
three
days
later
the
made
the
following
response
in
the
under
the
caption
pacific
innuendo
the
very
candid
pacific
and
highly
creditable
which
governor
ford
has
done
himself
the
honor
to
address
to
the
citizens
of
hancock
county
and
all
and
which
appears
in
the
of
the
instant
is
like
the
balm
of
gilead
well
calculated
to
ease
the
pain
which
has
troubled
the
heads
and
hearts
of
the
carthagenians
warsawvians
and
other
bodies
for
and
it
certainly
must
be
admitted
on
all
hands
that
governor
ford
has
exalted
himself
as
a
mediator
patriot
lawyer
governor
peacemaker
and
friend
of
all
not
only
to
magnify
the
law
and
make
it
honorable
but
also
in
pointing
out
the
of
such
is
what
the
saints
have
ever
sought
at
the
hands
of
those
in
authority
and
with
an
approving
conscience
clear
as
the
crystal
spring
and
with
a
laudable
intention
warm
as
the
summer
zephyr
and
with
a
charitable
prayer
mellow
as
the
morning
dew
it
is
now
our
highest
consolation
to
hope
that
all
difficulties
will
cease
and
give
way
to
reason
sense
peace
and
goodwill
the
saints
if
they
will
be
humble
and
wise
can
now
what
they
and
soften
by
good
examples
rather
than
harden
by
a
distinct
course
of
conduct
the
hearts
of
the
people
for
general
information
it
may
be
well
to
say
that
there
has
never
been
any
cause
for
alarm
as
to
the
saints
the
legislature
of
illinois
granted
a
liberal
charter
for
the
city
of
nauvoo
and
let
every
honest
man
in
the
union
who
has
any
knowledge
of
her
say
whether
she
has
not
flourished
beyond
the
most
sanguine
anticipations
of
all
and
while
they
witness
her
growing
glory
let
them
solemnly
testify
whether
nauvoo
has
the
country
county
or
a
single
individual
with
the
strictest
scrutiny
publish
the
facts
whether
a
particle
of
law
has
been
evaded
or
broken
virtue
and
innocence
need
no
artificial
covering
political
views
and
party
distinctions
never
should
disturb
the
harmony
of
society
and
when
the
whole
truth
comes
before
a
virtuous
people
we
are
willing
to
abide
the
issue
we
will
here
refer
to
the
late
upon
writs
of
of
joseph
smith
when
arrested
under
the
requisitions
of
missouri
the
first
in
june
was
tried
at
monmouth
before
judge
douglass
of
the
fifth
judicial
circuit
and
as
no
exceptions
have
been
taken
to
that
decision
by
this
state
or
missouri
but
missouri
had
previously
entered
a
on
all
the
old
indictments
against
the
mormons
in
the
difficulties
of
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
decision
was
the
second
in
december
was
tried
at
springfield
before
judge
pope
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
from
that
honorably
discharged
as
no
exceptions
from
any
source
have
been
made
to
those
proceedings
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
decision
was
and
the
third
in
july
was
tried
at
the
city
of
nauvoo
before
the
municipal
court
of
said
city
and
as
no
exceptions
to
that
discharge
have
been
taken
and
as
the
governor
says
there
is
evidence
on
the
other
side
to
show
that
the
sheriff
of
lee
county
carried
reynolds
who
had
smith
in
custody
to
the
city
of
nauvoo
without
any
coercion
on
the
part
of
any
one
it
must
be
admitted
that
decision
was
but
is
any
man
still
unconvinced
of
the
justness
of
these
strictures
relative
to
the
two
last
cases
let
the
astounding
fact
go
forth
that
porter
whom
boggs
swore
was
the
principal
in
his
assassination
and
accessory
to
which
smith
was
arrested
returned
home
clear
of
that
in
fact
there
was
not
a
witness
to
get
up
an
indictment
against
him
the
averys
who
were
unlawfully
transported
out
of
this
state
have
returned
to
their
families
in
peace
and
there
seems
to
be
no
ground
for
contention
no
cause
for
jealousy
and
no
excuse
for
a
surmise
that
any
man
woman
or
child
will
suffer
the
least
inconvenience
from
general
smith
the
charter
of
nauvoo
the
city
of
nauvoo
or
even
any
of
her
citizens
there
is
nothing
for
a
bone
of
contention
even
those
ordinances
which
appear
to
excite
the
feeling
of
some
people
have
recently
been
so
that
if
the
intelligent
inhabitants
of
hancock
county
want
peace
want
to
abide
by
the
governor
advice
want
to
have
a
character
abroad
grow
out
of
their
character
at
home
and
really
mean
to
follow
the
savior
golden
rule
do
unto
others
as
they
would
wish
others
to
do
unto
they
will
be
still
and
let
their
own
works
praise
them
in
the
gates
of
justice
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
surrounding
world
wise
men
ought
to
have
understanding
enough
to
conquer
men
with
kindness
a
soft
answer
turns
away
wrath
says
the
wise
man
and
it
will
be
greatly
to
the
credit
of
the
saints
to
show
the
love
of
god
by
now
kindly
treating
those
who
may
have
in
an
unconscious
moment
done
them
wrong
for
truly
said
jesus
for
thine
humanity
towards
all
reason
and
refinement
to
enforce
virtue
and
good
for
evil
are
so
eminently
designed
to
cure
more
disorders
of
society
than
an
appeal
to
arms
or
even
untempered
with
and
the
one
thing
needful
that
no
vision
for
the
future
guideboard
for
the
distant
or
expositor
for
the
present
need
trouble
any
one
with
what
he
ought
to
do
his
own
good
his
family
good
his
neighbor
good
his
good
and
all
good
seem
to
whisper
to
every
person
the
governor
has
told
you
what
to
do
do
the
constitution
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
and
when
he
fails
the
law
urges
him
or
should
he
do
too
much
the
same
master
rebukes
him
should
reason
liberty
law
light
and
philanthropy
now
guide
the
destinies
of
hancock
county
with
as
much
sincerity
as
has
been
manifested
for
her
notoriety
or
welfare
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
peace
prosperity
and
happiness
will
prevail
and
that
future
generations
as
well
as
the
present
one
will
call
governor
ford
a
peacemaker
the
saints
will
at
all
events
and
profit
by
the
instruction
and
call
upon
honest
men
to
help
them
cherish
all
the
love
all
the
friendship
all
the
courtesy
all
the
kindly
feelings
and
all
the
generosity
that
ought
to
characterize
in
a
clever
neighborhood
and
leave
candid
men
to
judge
which
tree
exhibits
the
best
fruit
the
one
with
the
most
clubs
and
sticks
thrown
into
its
boughs
and
the
grass
trodden
down
under
it
or
the
one
with
no
sticks
in
it
some
dead
limbs
and
rank
grass
growing
under
it
for
by
their
signs
ye
can
know
their
fruit
and
by
the
fruit
ye
know
the
trees
our
motto
then
is
with
if
we
have
joy
in
the
love
of
god
let
us
try
to
give
a
reason
of
that
joy
which
all
the
world
can
not
gainsay
or
resist
and
may
be
like
as
when
paul
started
with
recommendations
to
damascus
to
persecute
the
saints
some
one
who
has
raised
his
hand
against
us
with
letters
to
men
in
high
places
may
see
a
light
at
noonday
above
the
brightness
of
the
sun
and
hear
the
voice
of
jesus
saying
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
intelligence
is
sometimes
the
messenger
of
safety
and
willing
to
aid
the
governor
in
his
laudable
endeavors
to
cultivate
peace
and
honor
the
laws
believing
that
very
few
of
the
citizens
of
hancock
county
will
be
found
in
the
negative
of
such
a
goodly
course
and
considering
his
views
a
kind
of
manifesto
or
olive
leaf
which
shows
that
there
is
rest
for
the
soles
of
the
saints
feet
we
give
it
a
place
in
the
wishing
it
god
speed
and
saying
bless
good
men
and
good
measures
and
as
nauvoo
has
been
so
it
will
continue
to
be
a
good
city
affording
a
good
market
to
a
good
country
and
let
those
who
do
not
mean
to
try
the
way
of
transgressors
say
in
addition
to
this
in
a
note
to
the
editor
of
the
he
advised
that
he
take
no
further
editorial
notice
of
the
fulminations
of
the
editor
of
the
against
the
people
of
nauvoo
but
recommended
that
the
advice
of
governor
ford
be
honored
and
that
friendship
and
peace
be
cultivated
with
all
men
the
prophet
went
further
than
this
he
tendered
the
olive
branch
of
peace
even
to
missouri
he
dictated
the
following
to
phelps
which
was
published
under
the
title
a
friendly
hint
to
missouri
one
of
the
most
pleasing
scenes
that
can
transpire
on
earth
when
a
sin
has
been
committed
by
one
person
against
another
is
forgive
that
and
then
according
to
the
sublime
and
perfect
pattern
of
the
savior
pray
to
our
father
in
heaven
forgive
verily
verily
such
a
friendly
rebuke
is
like
the
mellow
zephyr
of
summer
eve
it
soothes
it
cheers
and
gladdens
the
heart
of
the
humane
and
the
savage
well
might
the
wise
man
exclaim
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
for
men
of
sense
judgment
and
observation
in
all
the
various
periods
of
time
have
been
witnesses
figuratively
speaking
that
not
wood
checks
the
rage
of
jesus
said
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
wherefore
if
the
nation
a
single
state
community
or
family
ought
to
be
grateful
for
anything
is
peace
lovely
child
of
heaven
peace
like
light
from
the
same
great
parent
gratifies
animates
and
happifies
the
just
and
the
unjust
and
is
the
very
essence
of
happiness
below
and
bliss
above
he
that
does
not
strive
with
all
his
powers
of
body
and
mind
with
all
his
influence
at
home
and
abroad
and
to
cause
others
to
do
so
too
to
seek
peace
and
maintain
it
for
his
own
benefit
and
convenience
and
for
the
honor
of
his
state
nation
and
country
has
no
claim
on
the
clemency
of
man
nor
should
he
be
entitled
to
the
friendship
of
woman
or
the
protection
of
government
he
is
the
to
gnaw
his
own
vitals
and
the
vulture
to
prey
upon
his
own
body
and
he
is
as
to
his
own
prospects
and
prosperity
in
life
a
of
his
own
pleasure
a
community
of
such
beings
are
not
far
from
hell
on
earth
and
should
be
let
alone
as
unfit
for
the
smiles
of
the
free
or
the
praise
of
the
brave
so
much
to
preface
this
friendly
hint
to
the
state
of
missouri
for
notwithstanding
some
of
her
private
citizens
and
public
officers
have
committed
violence
robbery
and
even
murder
upon
the
rights
and
persons
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
yet
compassion
dignity
and
a
sense
of
the
principles
of
religion
among
all
classes
and
honor
and
benevolence
mingled
with
charity
by
patriots
lead
me
to
suppose
that
there
are
many
worthy
people
in
that
state
who
will
use
their
influence
and
energies
to
bring
about
a
settlement
of
all
those
old
difficulties
and
use
all
consistent
means
to
urge
the
state
for
her
honor
prosperity
and
good
name
to
restore
every
person
she
or
her
citizens
have
expelled
from
her
limits
to
their
rights
and
pay
them
all
damage
that
the
great
body
of
and
southern
and
western
gentlemen
and
ladies
the
real
peacemakers
of
a
western
world
will
go
forth
good
and
pour
in
the
oil
and
wine
till
all
that
can
be
healed
are
made
whole
and
after
repentance
they
shall
be
forgiven
for
verily
the
scriptures
say
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repents
more
than
over
just
persons
that
need
no
repentance
when
you
meditate
upon
the
massacre
at
haun
mill
forget
not
that
the
constitution
of
your
state
holds
this
broad
truth
to
the
world
that
none
shall
be
deprived
of
liberty
or
but
by
the
judgment
of
his
peers
or
the
law
of
the
land
and
when
you
assemble
together
in
towns
countries
or
districts
whether
to
petition
your
legislature
to
pay
the
damage
the
saints
have
sustained
in
your
state
by
reason
of
oppression
and
misguided
zeal
or
to
restore
them
to
their
rights
according
to
republican
principles
and
benevolent
designs
reflect
and
make
honorable
or
annihilate
such
statute
law
as
was
in
force
in
your
state
in
if
twelve
or
more
persons
shall
combine
to
levy
war
against
any
part
of
the
people
of
this
state
or
to
remove
forcibly
out
of
the
state
or
from
their
habitations
evidenced
by
taking
arms
and
assembling
to
accomplish
such
purpose
every
person
so
offending
shall
be
punished
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
for
a
period
not
exceeding
five
years
or
by
a
fine
not
exceeding
five
thousand
dollars
and
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
not
exceeding
six
months
finally
if
honor
dignifies
an
honest
people
if
virtue
exalts
a
community
if
wisdom
guides
great
men
if
principle
governs
intelligent
beings
if
humanity
spreads
comfort
among
the
needy
and
if
religion
affords
consolation
by
showing
that
charity
is
the
first
best
and
sweetest
token
of
perfect
love
then
o
ye
good
people
of
missouri
like
the
woman
in
scripture
had
lost
one
of
her
ten
pieces
of
arise
search
diligently
till
you
find
the
lost
piece
and
then
make
a
feast
and
call
in
your
friends
for
joy
with
due
consideration
i
am
the
friend
of
all
good
men

in
peril
among
false
brethren
the
winter
of
was
big
with
events
affecting
the
destinies
of
nauvoo
during
that
winter
were
set
on
foot
conspiracies
which
culminated
in
the
destruction
of
nauvoo
men
who
stood
nearest
to
the
prophet
joseph
and
who
were
bound
in
honor
to
defend
his
life
not
bare
the
knives
that
were
to
strike
him
down
combined
together
in
secret
covenant
for
his
overthrow
owing
to
the
constant
efforts
of
the
prophet
enemies
in
missouri
to
capture
him
and
drag
him
to
missouri
where
he
might
be
murdered
with
impunity
the
force
of
police
in
nauvoo
was
increased
by
the
appointment
of
forty
to
patrol
the
city
these
made
it
less
convenient
for
the
conspirators
who
worked
as
men
ever
do
when
engaged
in
such
business
in
the
darkness
the
night
guards
several
times
came
in
contact
with
men
moving
about
the
city
in
a
manner
which
to
say
the
least
was
suspicious
and
soon
complaints
were
made
by
these
same
parties
that
the
city
government
was
arbitrary
and
oppressive
they
claimed
that
these
threatened
their
peace
and
even
started
rumors
that
joseph
had
appointed
them
for
the
purpose
of
intimidation
among
others
who
complained
of
the
appointment
of
was
william
marks
president
of
the
nauvoo
stake
joseph
in
the
course
of
a
speech
made
at
a
meeting
of
the
city
council
at
the
time
of
the
appointment
of
the
special
watchmen
referred
to
the
danger
of
invasion
from
missouri
and
incidentally
remarked
we
have
a
judas
in
our
midst
this
gave
great
offense
to
both
william
marks
and
the
law
brothers
the
prophet
in
his
journal
when
speaking
of
the
circumstance
says
what
can
be
the
matter
with
these
men
is
it
that
the
wicked
flee
when
no
man
pursueth
that
hit
pigeons
always
flutter
that
drowning
men
clutch
at
straws
or
that
presidents
law
and
marks
are
absolutely
traitors
to
the
church
that
my
remarks
should
produce
such
excitement
in
their
minds
can
it
be
possible
that
the
traitor
whom
porter
rockwell
reports
to
me
as
being
in
correspondence
with
my
missouri
enemies
is
one
of
my
quorum
the
first
presidency
the
people
in
the
town
were
astonished
almost
every
man
saying
to
his
neighbor
it
possible
that
brother
law
or
marks
is
a
traitor
and
would
deliver
brother
joseph
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
in
missouri
if
not
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
the
righteous
are
bold
as
a
lion
in
the
spring
of
the
prophet
was
apprised
by
two
young
men
denison
harris
and
robert
scott
the
latter
living
in
the
family
of
william
law
of
a
secret
movement
then
on
foot
to
take
his
life
and
the
lives
of
several
other
leading
men
of
the
church
among
them
the
prophet
brother
hyrum
these
young
men
were
invited
to
the
secret
meetings
by
the
conspirators
but
before
going
conferred
with
the
prophet
who
told
them
to
go
but
to
take
no
part
in
the
proceedings
of
these
wicked
men
against
himself
they
carried
out
his
advice
and
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
attended
the
secret
meetings
three
times
and
brought
to
joseph
a
report
of
what
they
had
witnessed
in
addition
to
the
testimonies
of
these
young
men
was
that
of
eaton
who
expressed
a
willingness
to
make
affidavit
that
there
was
a
plot
laid
to
kill
joseph
smith
and
others
and
would
give
the
names
of
those
who
had
concocted
it
there
was
also
one
a
williams
who
said
the
same
thing
these
men
went
before
daniel
wells
at
the
time
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
made
affidavit
that
such
a
plot
as
i
have
spoken
of
existed
in
their
statements
they
named
as
leaders
of
the
movement
chauncey
higbee
foster
joseph
jackson
and
william
and
wilson
law
these
names
correspond
with
those
given
by
the
young
men
before
alluded
to
except
they
also
name
austin
cowles
a
member
of
the
high
council
at
nauvoo
as
one
of
the
active
and
leading
conspirators
these
statements
were
shortly
confirmed
by
the
action
of
the
conspirators
themselves
as
they
soon
came
out
in
open
as
well
as
secret
opposition
to
the
leading
church
authorities
and
in
march
a
number
of
them
were
excommunicated
for
unchristianlike
conduct
among
the
number
was
william
law
a
member
in
the
first
presidency
his
brother
wilson
law
the
higbee
brothers
chauncey
and
francis
and
robert
foster
an
effort
was
made
by
these
apostates
to
organize
a
church
after
the
pattern
of
the
true
church
by
the
appointment
of
apostles
prophets
presidents
but
it
failed
miserably
their
following
was
insignificant
these
men
were
desperately
wicked
in
addition
to
gross
licentiousness
they
were
guilty
of
theft
and
of
counterfeiting
money
they
brought
much
reproach
upon
the
city
of
nauvoo
since
their
crimes
were
traced
to
her
borders
and
that
fact
went
far
towards
undoing
the
city
reputation
abroad
but
though
these
men
at
one
time
and
indeed
up
to
the
time
of
their
excommunication
held
high
official
positions
in
the
church
and
the
city
their
wickedness
was
not
sustained
either
by
the
church
laws
or
by
the
members
of
the
church
or
citizens
of
nauvoo
it
was
known
that
there
existed
a
band
of
desperate
men
within
the
city
and
these
parties
were
suspected
but
it
required
some
time
to
obtain
proof
sufficiently
positive
to
act
upon
and
where
the
counterfeiting
was
done
was
never
learned
the
mask
having
at
last
fallen
from
the
faces
of
this
coterie
of
men
they
joined
with
the
avowed
enemies
of
the
saints
outside
of
nauvoo
and
openly
advocated
the
repeal
of
the
city
charter
which
but
a
short
time
before
they
had
assisted
to
obtain
they
violated
on
several
occasions
the
city
ordinances
resisted
the
city
officers
and
threatened
the
life
of
the
mayor
these
disturbances
led
to
the
arrests
and
trials
before
the
municipal
court
from
which
the
accused
generally
appealed
to
the
circuit
courts
and
retaliated
by
counter
arrests
of
the
city
authorities
for
false
imprisonment
defamation
of
character
etc
in
all
these
cases
the
power
of
the
municipal
courts
to
grant
writs
of
was
freely
exercised
and
released
the
city
authorities
as
the
actions
were
malicious
and
without
sufficient
cause
on
which
to
base
the
complaints
thus
the
affairs
of
nauvoo
became
more
and
more
complicated
and
the
bitterness
constantly
increased
at
last
the
disaffected
parties
imported
a
press
into
the
city
and
proposed
publishing
a
paper
to
be
called
the
it
avowed
its
intention
in
the
prospectus
it
published
to
agitate
for
the
repeal
of
the
nauvoo
charter
and
also
announced
that
since
its
position
in
the
city
of
the
saints
afforded
it
opportunities
of
being
familiar
with
the
abuses
that
prevailed
its
publishers
intended
to
give
a
full
candid
and
succinct
statement
of
facts
as
they
really
existed
in
the
city
of
nauvoo
regardless
of
whose
standing
in
the
community
might
be
imperiled
the
proprietors
of
the
paper
were
the
band
of
conspirators
already
named
and
sylvester
emmons
was
employed
as
editor
the
first
and
indeed
the
only
number
of
the
was
published
on
the
seventh
day
of
june
and
contained
a
most
scandalous
attack
upon
the
most
respectable
citizens
of
nauvoo
it
at
once
filled
the
entire
city
with
indignation
and
the
city
council
immediately
took
into
consideration
what
would
be
the
best
method
of
dealing
with
it
the
result
of
the
council
meditations
was
this
blackstone
declared
a
libelous
press
a
nuisance
the
city
charter
gave
to
city
authorities
the
power
to
declare
what
should
be
considered
a
nuisance
and
to
prevent
and
remove
the
same
therefore
it
was
by
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
that
the
printing
office
from
whence
issues
the
is
a
public
nuisance
and
also
all
of
said
which
may
be
or
exist
in
said
establishment
and
the
mayor
is
instructed
to
cause
said
printing
establishment
and
papers
to
be
removed
without
delay
in
such
manner
as
he
may
direct
on
receiving
this
order
the
mayor
issued
instructions
to
the
city
marshal
to
destroy
the
press
without
delay
and
at
the
same
time
gave
orders
to
jonathan
dunham
acting
of
the
nauvoo
legion
to
assist
the
marshal
with
the
legion
if
called
upon
to
do
so
the
marshal
with
a
small
force
of
men
appeared
before
the
printing
establishment
informed
one
or
more
of
the
proprietors
of
the
character
of
his
mission
and
demanded
entrance
into
the
building
to
carry
out
his
instructions
from
the
mayor
this
was
denied
and
the
door
locked
whereupon
the
marshal
broke
in
the
door
carried
out
the
press
broke
it
in
the
street
pied
the
type
and
burned
all
the
papers
found
in
the
office
and
then
reported
to
the
mayor
who
sent
an
account
of
these
proceedings
to
the
governor
of
the
state
this
act
enraged
the
conspirators
to
a
higher
pitch
of
desperation
they
set
fire
to
their
buildings
and
then
fled
to
carthage
the
county
seat
of
hancock
county
with
the
lie
in
their
mouths
that
their
lives
were
in
danger
in
nauvoo
and
that
they
were
driven
away
from
their
homes
fortunately
the
police
discovered
the
flames
started
by
these
incendiaries
in
time
to
extinguish
them
so
that
they
failed
to
have
the
smoking
ruins
of
their
own
houses
to
support
their
story
but
their
misrepresentations
spread
like
and
inflamed
the
public
mind
already
blinded
with
prejudice
against
the
people
of
nauvoo
to
a
point
which
made
violence
almost
certain
francis
higbee
made
a
complaint
before
thomas
morrison
a
justice
of
the
peace
against
joseph
smith
and
all
the
members
of
the
nauvoo
city
council
for
riot
committed
in
destroying
the
press
the
warrant
issued
by
the
justice
was
served
by
constable
bettisworth
upon
joseph
smith
at
nauvoo
it
required
him
and
the
others
named
in
the
warrant
to
go
before
the
justice
issuing
the
warrant
some
other
justice
of
the
joseph
called
the
attention
of
the
constable
to
this
clause
in
the
writ
and
expressed
a
willingness
to
go
before
esquire
johnson
or
any
other
justice
of
the
peace
in
nauvoo
but
bettisworth
was
determined
to
take
joseph
to
carthage
before
justice
morrison
who
had
issued
the
writ
joseph
was
equally
determined
not
to
go
and
petitioned
the
municipal
court
for
a
writ
of
which
was
granted
and
under
it
the
prisoner
was
honorably
discharged
the
other
parties
mentioned
in
the
writ
followed
his
example
and
were
also
discharged
meantime
indignation
meetings
were
held
first
at
warsaw
and
afterwards
in
carthage
the
men
who
had
used
their
uttermost
endeavors
for
more
than
two
years
to
incite
the
people
to
acts
of
mob
violence
against
the
saints
had
now
a
popular
war
cry
unhallowed
hands
had
been
laid
upon
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
law
had
ceased
to
be
a
protection
to
lives
or
property
in
nauvoo
a
mob
at
nauvoo
under
a
city
ordinance
had
violated
the
highest
privilege
in
the
government
and
to
seek
redress
in
the
ordinary
mode
would
be
utterly
ineffectual
therefore
those
in
attendance
upon
these
meetings
adopted
resolutions
announcing
themselves
at
all
times
ready
to
with
their
in
missouri
and
iowa
to
exterminate
the
wicked
and
abominable
mormon
leaders
the
authors
of
their
troubles
committees
were
appointed
to
notify
all
persons
in
the
respective
townships
suspected
of
being
the
tools
of
the
prophet
to
leave
immediately
on
pain
of
and
it
was
further
recommended
that
the
adherents
of
joseph
smith
as
a
body
be
driven
from
the
surrounding
settlements
into
nauvoo
that
the
prophet
and
his
miscreant
adherents
should
then
be
demanded
at
their
hands
and
if
not
surrendered
a
war
of
entire
extermination
should
be
waged
to
the
entire
destruction
if
necessary
for
the
mob
protection
of
his
adherents
and
to
carry
out
these
resolutions
every
citizen
was
called
upon
to
arm
himself
the
mass
meeting
at
carthage
which
had
adopted
the
warsaw
resolutions
was
in
full
blast
when
the
news
arrived
of
the
failure
of
constable
bettisworth
to
drag
the
prophet
into
their
midst
this
increased
the
excitement
and
poured
more
gall
into
the
cup
of
bitterness
it
was
resolved
that
the
riot
in
nauvoo
was
still
progressing
and
of
such
a
serious
character
as
to
demand
executive
interference
and
therefore
two
discreet
citizens
were
appointed
to
go
to
springfield
and
lay
the
case
before
governor
ford
but
this
appeal
to
the
executive
was
not
to
interfere
with
the
resolutions
before
passed
active
preparations
for
the
extermination
of
the
mormons
were
to
be
continued
the
authorities
at
nauvoo
also
dispatched
trusty
messengers
to
governor
ford
with
truthful
accounts
of
their
proceedings
both
as
regards
the
destruction
of
the
press
and
their
action
in
refusing
to
accompany
constable
bettisworth
to
carthage
that
he
might
not
be
misled
by
a
false
representation
of
the
case
or
influenced
by
the
thousand
and
one
falsehoods
that
had
been
set
on
foot
by
the
enemies
of
the
saints
both
parties
then
appealed
to
the
executive
of
the
state
the
mob
for
assistance
to
carry
out
their
murderous
designs
and
to
give
their
proceedings
a
coloring
of
lawful
authority
and
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
for
protection
against
the
combinations
of
their
avowed
enemies
bent
upon
and
publicly
pledged
to
their
extermination
without
waiting
the
issue
of
this
appeal
however
the
mob
forces
in
carthage
warsaw
and
other
localities
began
active
operations
by
sending
their
committees
to
the
settlements
of
the
saints
outside
of
nauvoo
and
threatening
them
with
destruction
if
they
did
not
accept
one
of
three
propositions
first
deny
that
joseph
smith
was
a
prophet
of
god
and
take
up
arms
and
accompany
the
mob
to
arrest
him
second
gather
up
their
effects
and
forthwith
remove
to
the
city
of
nauvoo
third
give
up
their
arms
and
remain
quiet
until
the
pending
difficulties
should
be
settled
by
the
expulsion
of
their
friends
usually
a
few
days
were
given
the
people
to
consider
these
propositions
which
were
utilized
by
the
people
in
conferring
with
the
prophet
to
know
what
he
advised
under
the
circumstances
the
advice
given
in
its
general
purport
was
to
yield
up
none
of
their
rights
as
american
citizens
to
the
demand
of
mobocrats
but
to
maintain
their
rights
wherever
they
were
strong
enough
to
resist
the
mob
forces
and
when
they
were
not
strong
enough
retreat
to
nauvoo
besides
the
reports
which
came
to
nauvoo
from
the
saints
who
were
threatened
the
air
was
filled
with
rumors
of
mob
forces
collecting
on
every
hand
great
excitement
was
reported
to
exist
in
upper
missouri
the
part
of
that
state
from
which
the
saints
had
been
driven
but
six
years
before
and
it
was
reported
that
the
missourians
were
going
over
into
illinois
in
large
numbers
to
assist
the
in
and
around
carthage
that
arms
and
ammunition
were
sent
over
the
mississippi
to
the
mob
is
quite
certain
and
it
is
also
known
that
walter
bagley
the
for
hancock
county
had
spent
some
time
in
missouri
as
an
agent
and
agitator
seeking
to
bring
about
a
concerted
action
between
the
old
enemies
of
the
saints
and
those
of
like
ilk
in
illinois
while
these
hostile
preparations
were
being
made
for
his
destruction
and
the
extermination
of
his
people
those
at
all
acquainted
with
the
temperament
of
the
prophet
joseph
might
well
know
that
he
was
not
idle
he
kept
an
efficient
corps
of
clerks
busy
copying
reports
and
affidavits
of
threatened
violence
and
insurrection
and
sent
them
to
the
governor
whom
he
petitioned
to
come
to
nauvoo
and
in
person
investigate
the
causes
of
the
disturbance
information
was
also
sent
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
acquainting
him
with
the
prospects
of
an
insurrection
and
an
invasion
of
illinois
by
missourians
and
asking
him
for
protection
nor
was
joseph
and
his
associates
neglectful
of
anything
that
would
have
a
tendency
to
allay
the
excitement
jesse
thomas
judge
of
the
circuit
in
which
hancock
county
was
located
advised
him
to
go
before
some
justice
of
the
peace
of
the
county
and
have
an
examination
of
the
charges
specified
in
the
writ
issued
by
justice
morrison
of
carthage
and
that
would
take
away
all
excuse
for
a
mob
and
he
would
be
bound
to
order
them
to
keep
the
peace
some
advised
the
prophet
to
go
to
carthage
but
that
he
emphatically
refused
to
do
but
he
and
all
others
named
in
justice
morrison
warrant
went
before
squire
wells
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
after
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
case
were
acquitted
in
addition
to
these
movements
a
mass
meeting
was
held
in
nauvoo
at
which
john
taylor
was
chairman
pacific
resolutions
were
adopted
denying
the
misrepresentations
of
the
apostates
and
appointing
men
to
go
to
the
neighboring
towns
and
settlements
to
present
the
truth
to
the
people
and
allay
excitement
these
men
were
authorized
to
say
that
the
members
of
the
city
council
charged
with
riot
and
the
violation
of
law
were
willing
to
go
before
the
circuit
court
for
an
investigation
of
their
conduct
in
respect
to
the
and
refused
not
to
be
bound
over
for
such
a
hearing
but
when
this
announcement
was
made
and
it
was
learned
that
judge
thomas
had
advised
this
course
to
allay
excitement
the
mob
threatened
that
a
committee
would
wait
upon
the
judge
and
give
him
a
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
for
giving
such
advice
these
pacific
measures
appearing
to
have
little
or
no
effect
and
active
preparations
for
hostilities
continuing
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
nauvoo
was
placed
under
martial
law
the
legion
was
mustered
into
service
and
joseph
in
person
took
command
of
it
he
was
in
full
uniform
when
he
appeared
before
the
legion
and
mounting
an
unfinished
frame
building
near
the
mansion
he
took
occasion
to
address
the
legion
and
the
people
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
during
which
time
he
reviewed
the
events
that
had
brought
upon
nauvoo
the
issue
that
confronted
them
to
dispel
any
illusion
that
any
of
them
might
have
that
he
was
the
only
one
threatened
he
said
it
is
thought
by
some
that
our
enemies
would
be
satisfied
by
my
destruction
but
i
tell
you
as
soon
as
they
have
shed
my
blood
they
will
thirst
for
the
blood
of
every
man
in
whose
heart
dwells
a
single
spark
of
the
spirit
of
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
the
opposition
of
these
men
is
moved
by
the
spirit
of
the
adversary
of
all
righteousness
it
is
not
only
to
destroy
me
but
every
man
and
woman
who
dares
believe
the
doctrines
that
god
hath
inspired
me
to
teach
to
this
generation
words
which
subsequent
events
will
prove
to
have
been
prophetic
he
also
said
we
have
forwarded
a
particular
account
of
all
our
doings
to
the
governor
we
are
ready
to
obey
his
commands
and
we
expect
that
protection
at
his
hands
which
we
know
to
be
our
just
due
we
may
add
also
that
when
a
petition
was
sent
to
the
governor
to
come
to
nauvoo
in
person
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
the
service
of
the
legion
was
tendered
him
to
keep
the
peace
but
that
joseph
had
come
to
a
settled
determination
to
maintain
the
rights
of
the
people
at
all
hazards
and
submit
no
longer
to
mob
violence
may
be
clearly
understood
from
the
spirit
of
these
extracts
from
the
speech
made
to
the
legion
on
the
occasion
of
his
taking
command
of
it
we
are
american
citizens
we
live
upon
a
soil
for
the
liberties
of
which
our
fathers
periled
their
lives
and
split
their
blood
upon
the
battlefield
those
rights
so
dearly
purchased
shall
not
be
disgracefully
trodden
under
foot
by
lawless
marauders
without
at
least
a
noble
effort
on
our
part
to
sustain
our
liberties
will
you
stand
by
me
to
the
death
and
sustain
at
the
peril
of
our
lives
the
laws
of
our
country
and
the
liberties
and
privileges
which
our
fathers
have
transmitted
unto
us
sealed
with
their
sacred
blood
thousands
shouted
aye
it
is
well
if
you
had
not
done
it
i
would
have
gone
out
there
pointing
to
the
west
and
would
have
raised
up
a
mighty
people
i
call
upon
all
men
from
maine
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
from
mexico
to
british
america
whose
hearts
thrill
with
horror
to
behold
the
rights
of
free
men
trampled
under
foot
to
come
to
the
deliverance
of
this
people
from
the
cruel
hand
of
oppression
cruelty
anarchy
and
misrule
to
which
they
have
long
been
made
subject
i
call
upon
god
and
angels
to
witness
that
i
have
unsheathed
my
sword
with
a
firm
and
unalterable
determination
that
this
people
shall
have
their
legal
rights
and
shall
be
protected
from
mob
violence
or
my
blood
shall
be
split
upon
the
ground
like
water
and
my
body
be
consigned
to
the
silent
tomb
while
i
live
i
will
never
tamely
submit
to
the
dominion
of
cursed
mobocracy
there
was
much
more
of
a
like
tenor
but
this
is
sufficient
to
show
the
determination
of
the
prophet
not
to
submit
to
the
mobs
then
rising
about
him
and
the
people
warmly
seconded
his
resolution
at
this
juncture
joseph
requested
his
brother
hyrum
to
take
his
family
and
go
with
them
to
cincinnati
but
hyrum
demurred
and
said
joseph
i
ca
leave
you
joseph
turning
to
a
number
of
brethren
present
said
i
wish
i
could
get
hyrum
out
of
the
way
so
that
he
may
live
to
avenge
my
blood
and
i
will
stay
with
you
and
see
it
out
but
hyrum
smith
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
leave
his
brother
now
that
the
hour
of
his
severest
trial
had
come
upon
him
his
noble
nature
revolted
at
the
thought
and
though
the
spirit
had
doubtless
whispered
joseph
that
his
life
and
that
of
hyrum
would
be
sacrificed
in
the
impending
crisis
his
pathetic
words
joseph
i
ca
leave
you
bear
testimony
to
the
nobility
of
the
soul
that
uttered
them
and
is
a
witness
to
the
strength
of
those
bonds
of
love
that
bound
him
to
his
younger
brother
moreover
in
consequence
of
the
prophet
premonitions
of
his
approaching
martyrdom
he
had
ordained
his
brother
hyrum
to
succeed
him
in
the
presidency
of
the
church
and
hence
this
consideration
as
well
as
his
affectionate
regard
for
him
as
a
brother
doubtless
led
him
to
try
to
get
hyrum
out
of
harm
way
word
was
sent
to
brigham
young
then
on
a
mission
in
the
eastern
states
to
return
to
nauvoo
and
to
communicate
with
the
other
apostles
and
request
them
also
to
return
to
nauvoo
as
likewise
all
the
elders
and
as
many
more
good
faithful
men
as
felt
disposed
to
accompany
them
to
assist
the
saints
thus
every
effort
was
being
put
forth
by
the
people
of
nauvoo
to
resist
oppression
and
maintain
their
rights

compliance
with
the
demands
of
governor
ford
in
the
midst
of
these
preparations
a
message
was
received
from
governor
ford
stating
that
he
had
arrived
in
carthage
in
the
interests
of
peace
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
avert
the
evils
of
war
by
his
presence
and
that
he
might
the
better
judge
of
the
situation
he
asked
that
and
discreet
persons
be
sent
to
him
at
carthage
where
he
had
established
for
the
time
his
headquarters
this
request
of
the
governor
was
gladly
complied
with
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
and
john
taylor
and
bernhisel
were
appointed
to
represent
their
version
of
the
situation
and
for
that
purpose
were
furnished
with
a
copy
of
the
proceedings
of
the
city
council
and
the
affidavits
of
a
number
of
citizens
bearing
on
the
subjects
that
would
likely
be
discussed
these
representatives
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
found
the
governor
surrounded
by
their
enemies
the
laws
fosters
and
higbees
besides
others
living
at
warsaw
and
carthage
the
only
audience
given
to
taylor
and
bernhisel
was
in
the
presence
of
these
parties
by
whom
they
were
frequently
interrupted
in
the
most
insulting
manner
and
the
parties
insulting
and
abusing
them
were
unchecked
by
governor
ford
after
the
governor
had
heard
the
statements
of
these
gentlemen
and
read
the
documents
presented
by
them
he
sent
a
written
communication
to
the
mayor
joseph
smith
in
which
he
said
that
by
destroying
the
press
the
city
council
of
nauvoo
had
committed
a
gross
outrage
upon
the
laws
and
liberties
of
the
people
and
had
violated
the
constitution
in
several
particulars
he
also
claimed
that
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
had
exceeded
its
authority
in
granting
writs
of
he
accepted
the
statement
of
the
mob
at
carthage
that
joseph
smith
refused
to
be
tried
by
any
other
court
than
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
although
he
had
before
him
the
most
positive
proof
that
joseph
was
willing
to
go
before
any
justice
of
the
peace
in
hancock
county
except
justice
morrison
of
carthage
where
an
angry
mob
had
collected
and
were
threatening
his
destruction
and
since
the
warrant
was
made
returnable
to
the
magistrate
who
issued
it
or
any
other
justice
in
the
county
the
prophet
expressed
a
willingness
to
go
before
any
other
justice
but
very
properly
refused
to
go
to
carthage
he
was
even
willing
to
be
bound
over
to
appear
in
the
circuit
court
to
answer
for
the
part
he
took
in
abating
the
press
as
a
nuisance
yet
in
the
face
of
these
facts
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
all
the
parties
charged
with
riot
had
appeared
before
wells
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
and
after
investigation
were
acquitted
yet
the
governor
charged
the
members
of
the
city
council
with
refusing
to
appear
before
any
other
than
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
for
an
investigation
he
demanded
that
the
mayor
and
all
persons
in
nauvoo
accused
or
sued
submit
in
all
cases
implicitly
to
the
process
of
the
courts
and
to
interpose
no
obstacles
to
an
arrest
either
by
writ
of
or
otherwise
and
in
the
case
of
the
mayor
and
a
number
of
the
city
council
charged
with
riot
he
required
that
they
should
be
arrested
by
the
same
constable
by
virtue
of
the
same
warrant
and
tried
before
the
same
magistrate
whose
authority
he
insisted
had
been
resisted
nothing
short
of
this
he
added
can
vindicate
the
dignity
of
violated
law
and
allay
the
just
excitement
of
the
people
taylor
and
bernhisel
called
his
attention
to
the
state
of
excitement
in
carthage
and
informed
him
that
there
were
men
there
bent
on
killing
the
prophet
and
that
to
ensure
his
safety
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
be
accompanied
by
an
armed
force
which
would
doubtless
provoke
a
collision
in
answer
to
this
the
governor
advised
them
to
bring
no
arms
and
pledged
his
faith
as
governor
and
that
of
the
state
to
protect
those
who
should
go
to
carthage
for
trial
he
also
made
the
same
pledge
in
his
written
communication
to
joseph
the
conduct
of
the
governor
in
thus
adopting
the
reports
of
the
enemies
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
menacing
the
city
with
destruction
if
his
arbitrary
commands
were
not
complied
with
created
no
small
amount
of
astonishment
in
nauvoo
joseph
however
wrote
a
courteous
reply
corrected
the
governor
errors
and
also
represented
that
the
city
council
of
nauvoo
had
acted
on
their
best
judgment
aided
by
the
best
legal
advice
they
could
procure
but
if
a
mistake
had
been
made
they
were
willing
to
make
all
things
right
but
asked
that
the
mob
might
be
dispersed
that
their
lives
might
not
be
endangered
while
on
trial
relative
to
going
to
carthage
however
joseph
pointed
out
the
fact
that
the
governor
himself
in
his
written
communication
had
expressed
his
fears
that
he
could
not
control
the
mob
in
which
case
he
went
on
to
say
we
are
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
merciless
sir
we
dare
not
come
for
our
lives
would
be
in
danger
and
we
are
guilty
of
no
crime
on
a
hasty
consultation
with
his
brother
hyrum
richards
and
taylor
and
bernhisel
after
the
return
of
the
latter
from
their
conference
with
governor
ford
it
was
decided
that
joseph
should
proceed
to
washington
and
lay
the
case
before
president
tyler
and
he
informed
governor
ford
of
this
intention
in
the
letter
above
referred
to
that
plan
however
at
a
subsequent
council
meeting
was
abandoned
as
joseph
received
an
inspiration
to
go
to
the
west
and
all
would
be
well
he
said
to
the
trusted
brethren
in
that
council
the
way
is
open
it
is
clear
to
my
mind
what
to
do
all
they
want
is
hyrum
and
myself
then
tell
everybody
to
go
about
their
business
and
not
collect
in
groups
but
scatter
about
there
is
no
danger
they
will
come
here
and
search
for
us
let
them
search
they
will
not
harm
you
in
person
or
in
property
and
not
even
a
hair
of
your
head
we
will
cross
the
river
tonight
and
go
away
to
the
west
this
was
between
nine
and
ten
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
and
preparations
were
at
once
entered
into
to
carry
out
this
impression
of
the
spirit
phelps
was
instructed
to
take
the
families
of
the
prophet
and
his
brother
to
cincinnati
and
that
night
rockwell
rowed
joseph
hyrum
and
richards
over
the
mississippi
to
montrose
and
then
returned
with
instructions
to
procure
horses
for
them
and
make
all
necessary
preparations
to
start
for
the
great
basin
in
the
rocky
mountains
about
ten
the
next
day
the
governor
arrived
in
nauvoo
to
arrest
joseph
but
not
finding
him
it
returned
to
carthage
leaving
a
man
by
the
name
of
yates
to
watch
for
the
prophet
appearing
this
man
said
that
if
the
mayor
and
his
brother
were
not
given
up
the
governor
had
expressed
a
determination
to
send
his
troops
into
the
city
and
guard
it
until
they
were
found
if
it
took
three
years
at
this
crisis
some
of
joseph
friends
instead
of
rendering
him
all
possible
assistance
to
escape
from
his
enemies
complained
of
his
conduct
as
cowardly
and
entreated
him
to
return
to
nauvoo
and
not
leave
them
like
a
false
shepherd
leaves
his
flock
when
the
wolves
attack
them
the
parties
most
forward
in
making
this
charge
of
cowardice
were
reynolds
cahoon
wasson
and
hiram
kimball
emma
smith
his
wife
also
sent
a
letter
by
the
hand
of
reynolds
cahoon
entreating
him
to
return
and
give
himself
up
trusting
to
the
pledges
of
the
governor
for
a
fair
trial
influenced
by
these
entreaties
to
return
and
stung
by
the
taunts
of
cowardice
from
those
who
should
have
been
his
friends
he
said
if
my
life
is
of
no
value
to
my
friends
it
is
of
none
to
myself
and
after
a
brief
consultation
with
rockwell
and
his
brother
hyrum
against
his
better
judgment
and
with
the
conviction
fixed
in
his
soul
that
he
would
be
killed
he
resolved
to
return
and
crossed
over
the
river
that
evening
to
nauvoo
his
first
act
after
arriving
in
the
beautiful
city
of
which
he
was
the
chief
founder
was
to
send
word
to
the
governor
by
the
hand
of
theodore
turley
and
jedediah
grant
that
he
would
be
ready
to
go
to
carthage
as
early
on
the
morrow
as
his
the
governor
could
meet
him
provided
he
could
be
assured
a
fair
trial
and
his
witnesses
not
be
abused
that
message
was
delivered
to
the
governor
and
he
decided
at
once
to
send
a
to
escort
joseph
and
his
party
to
carthage
but
through
the
influence
which
wilson
law
joseph
jackson
and
others
of
like
character
had
over
him
he
changed
his
good
intention
of
sending
a
and
ordered
joseph
messengers
to
return
that
night
with
orders
to
him
to
be
in
carthage
the
next
day
by
ten
without
an
escort
and
he
threatened
that
if
joseph
did
not
give
himself
up
by
that
time
nauvoo
would
be
destroyed
owing
to
the
jaded
condition
of
their
horses
the
messengers
did
not
reach
nauvoo
until
daylight
of
the
after
the
orders
of
the
governor
were
delivered
the
faithful
brethren
who
reported
them
began
to
warn
the
prophet
against
trusting
himself
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
but
he
stopped
them
and
would
not
hear
them
further
he
had
decided
on
his
course
early
on
the
morning
of
the
joseph
and
the
members
of
the
city
council
against
whom
complaints
had
been
made
before
justice
morrison
accompanied
by
a
few
friends
started
for
carthage
to
give
themselves
up
as
they
passed
the
temple
the
party
paused
and
the
prophet
looked
with
admiration
upon
the
noble
edifice
and
the
glorious
landscape
which
everywhere
from
that
spot
greets
the
eye
and
then
said
this
is
the
loveliest
place
and
the
best
people
under
the
heavens
little
do
they
know
the
trials
that
await
them
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
they
passed
the
home
of
squire
wells
who
at
the
time
was
sick
joseph
dismounted
and
called
to
see
him
at
parting
the
prophet
said
to
him
cheerfully
squire
wells
i
wish
you
to
cherish
my
memory
and
not
think
me
the
worst
man
in
the
world
either
about
ten
the
party
arrived
within
four
miles
of
carthage
and
there
met
a
company
of
sixty
mounted
militiamen
under
the
command
of
captain
dunn
on
their
way
to
nauvoo
with
orders
from
governor
ford
to
demand
the
state
arms
in
possession
of
the
nauvoo
legion
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
meeting
these
troops
that
joseph
uttered
those
prophetic
words
am
going
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
but
i
am
calm
as
a
morning
i
have
a
conscience
void
of
offense
towards
god
and
towards
all
men
i
shall
die
innocent
and
it
shall
yet
be
said
of
me
he
was
murdered
in
cold
at
the
request
of
captain
dunn
he
countersigned
the
governor
order
for
the
state
arms
but
the
captain
prevailed
upon
him
to
return
to
nauvoo
and
assist
in
collecting
the
arms
promising
that
afterwards
the
militia
under
his
command
should
escort
himself
and
party
into
carthage
and
he
would
protect
them
even
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
to
which
his
men
assented
by
three
hearty
cheers
it
is
supposed
that
captain
dunn
feared
the
people
in
nauvoo
might
become
exasperated
and
resent
the
indignity
offered
them
in
demanding
the
surrender
of
the
state
arms
hence
his
anxiety
to
have
joseph
return
a
message
was
sent
to
the
governor
informing
him
of
this
new
move
the
arms
were
collected
without
any
difficulty
though
the
people
unwillingly
surrendered
them
since
disarming
them
and
allowing
their
enemies
who
had
vowed
their
extermination
to
keep
their
arms
smacked
of
treachery
but
the
order
of
the
governor
and
of
their
was
complied
with
the
arms
were
taken
to
the
masonic
hall
and
stacked
up
buckmaster
receiving
them
this
demand
for
the
state
arms
stirred
the
fiery
indignation
of
squire
wells
to
the
very
depths
of
his
soul
he
arose
from
his
bed
of
sickness
and
carried
what
state
arms
he
had
a
pair
of
to
the
appointed
place
and
threw
them
at
the
feet
of
officer
buckmaster
with
the
remark
there
your
arms
then
as
he
glared
at
the
officer
he
said
i
have
a
pair
of
epaulets
at
home
and
i
have
never
disgraced
them
either
and
too
full
of
righteous
wrath
for
further
speech
he
walked
away
the
arms
collected
captain
dunn
thanked
the
people
for
their
promptness
in
complying
with
the
demands
of
the
governor
and
promised
them
that
while
they
conducted
themselves
in
such
a
peaceable
manner
they
should
be
protected
the
company
of
militia
accompanied
by
joseph
and
his
party
started
for
carthage
about
six
in
the
evening
passing
the
masonic
hall
where
a
number
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
still
lingered
having
been
attracted
there
to
witness
the
surrender
of
the
state
arms
the
prophet
joseph
raised
his
hat
and
said
boys
if
i
do
come
back
take
care
of
yourselves
i
am
going
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
when
the
company
was
passing
his
farm
joseph
stopped
and
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
then
after
he
had
passed
he
turned
and
looked
again
and
yet
again
several
times
his
action
occasioned
some
remarks
by
several
of
the
company
to
which
in
reply
he
said
if
some
of
you
had
such
a
farm
and
knew
you
would
not
see
it
any
more
you
would
want
to
take
a
good
look
at
it
for
the
last
time
it
was
midnight
when
the
party
entered
carthage
but
a
militia
company
encamped
on
the
public
square
the
carthage
greys
were
aroused
and
gave
vent
to
profane
threats
as
the
company
passed
of
which
the
following
is
a
specimen
where
the
d
n
prophet
stand
away
you
mcdonough
boys
and
let
us
shoot
the
d
n
mormons
g
d
d
n
you
old
joe
we
got
you
now
clear
the
way
and
let
us
have
a
view
of
joe
smith
the
prophet
of
god
he
has
seen
the
last
of
nauvoo
use
him
up
now
amid
such
profanity
and
abuse
and
violent
threats
much
of
which
was
overheard
by
governor
ford
the
prophet
party
proceeded
to
hotel
which
it
entered
and
took
quarters
for
the
night
under
the
same
roof
were
sheltered
the
wicked
apostates
of
nauvoo
jackson
the
foster
brothers
the
higbees
and
the
laws
besides
other
desperate
men
who
had
sworn
to
take
the
life
of
the
prophet
the
crowd
which
had
followed
the
nauvoo
party
from
the
public
square
still
hung
round
the
hamilton
house
yelling
and
cursing
and
acting
like
ravenous
beasts
hungry
for
their
prey
governor
ford
pushed
up
a
window
and
thus
addressed
them
gentlemen
i
know
your
great
anxiety
to
see
smith
which
is
natural
enough
but
it
is
quite
too
late
tonight
for
you
to
have
that
opportunity
but
i
assure
you
gentlemen
you
shall
have
that
privilege
tomorrow
morning
as
i
will
cause
him
to
pass
before
the
troops
upon
the
square
and
i
now
wish
you
with
this
assurance
quietly
and
peaceably
to
return
to
your
quarters
in
answer
to
this
there
was
a
faint
hurrah
for
tom
ford
and
the
crowd
withdrew
they
could
afford
to
wait
god
servants
were
in
the
hands
of
the
merciless
footnotes
captain
dunn
company
was
composed
chiefly
of
men
from
mcdonough
county
hence
the
remark
chapter
xxxviii
the
martyrdom
early
in
the
morning
following
their
entrance
into
carthage
joseph
his
brother
hyrum
and
the
other
members
of
the
nauvoo
city
council
named
in
the
warrant
of
arrest
sworn
out
by
the
higbees
voluntarily
surrendered
themselves
to
constable
bettisworth
shortly
afterwards
the
prophet
was
again
arrested
by
the
same
constable
on
a
charge
of
treason
against
the
state
and
people
of
illinois
on
the
oath
of
augustine
spencer
hyrum
was
arrested
on
a
similar
charge
sworn
out
by
henry
norton
and
thus
the
difficulties
thickened
soon
after
the
second
arrest
governor
ford
presented
himself
at
their
rooms
at
the
hamilton
house
and
requested
joseph
to
accompany
him
as
he
desired
to
present
him
to
the
troops
to
whom
he
had
promised
the
night
before
a
view
of
the
prophet
the
troops
had
been
drawn
up
in
two
lines
and
joseph
and
hyrum
linking
arms
with
miner
deming
passed
down
them
accompanied
by
their
friends
and
a
company
of
carthage
greys
they
were
introduced
as
general
joseph
and
general
hyrum
smith
the
carthage
greys
a
few
minutes
before
at
the
headquarters
of
general
deming
had
revolted
and
behaved
in
an
uproarious
manner
but
were
pacified
by
the
governor
and
accompanied
him
general
deming
and
the
prophet
and
his
party
to
where
the
other
troops
were
drawn
up
in
line
here
they
again
revolted
because
the
brothers
smith
were
introduced
to
the
troops
from
mcdonough
county
as
generals
smith
some
of
the
officers
of
the
carthage
greys
threw
up
their
hats
drew
their
swords
and
said
they
would
introduce
themselves
to
the
d
ned
mormons
in
a
different
style
they
were
again
pacified
by
the
governor
who
promised
them
full
satisfaction
but
they
continued
to
act
in
such
an
insubordinate
manner
that
general
deming
put
them
under
arrest
but
afterwards
released
them
without
punishment
shortly
after
this
episode
with
the
carthage
greys
a
number
of
the
officers
of
other
militia
companies
and
other
gentlemen
curious
to
see
the
prophet
crowded
into
the
hotel
joseph
took
occasion
to
ask
them
if
there
was
anything
in
his
appearance
to
indicate
that
he
was
the
desperate
character
his
enemies
represented
him
to
be
to
which
they
replied
no
sir
your
appearance
would
indicate
the
very
contrary
general
smith
but
we
can
not
see
what
is
in
your
heart
neither
can
we
tell
what
are
your
intentions
very
true
gentlemen
quickly
replied
the
prophet
you
can
not
see
what
is
in
my
heart
and
you
are
therefore
unable
to
judge
me
or
my
intentions
but
i
can
see
what
is
in
your
hearts
and
will
tell
you
what
i
see
i
can
see
that
you
thirst
for
blood
and
nothing
but
my
blood
will
satisfy
you
it
is
not
for
crime
of
any
description
that
i
and
my
brethren
are
thus
continually
persecuted
and
harassed
by
our
enemies
but
there
are
other
motives
and
some
of
them
i
have
expressed
so
far
as
relates
to
myself
and
inasmuch
as
you
and
the
people
thirst
for
blood
i
prophesy
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
you
shall
witness
scenes
of
blood
and
sorrow
to
your
entire
satisfaction
your
souls
shall
be
perfectly
satiated
with
blood
and
many
of
you
who
are
now
present
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
face
the
cannon
mouth
from
sources
you
think
not
of
and
those
people
that
desire
this
great
evil
upon
me
and
my
brethren
shall
be
filled
with
sorrow
because
of
the
scenes
of
desolation
and
distress
that
await
them
they
shall
seek
for
peace
and
shall
not
be
able
to
find
it
gentlemen
you
will
find
what
i
have
told
you
will
come
true
the
members
of
the
nauvoo
city
council
under
arrest
for
riot
in
destroying
the
press
were
taken
before
smith
justice
of
the
peace
and
also
captain
of
the
carthage
greys
it
will
be
remembered
perhaps
that
governor
ford
had
told
joseph
in
a
communication
referred
to
in
the
last
chapter
that
nothing
but
his
appearing
before
justice
morrison
who
issued
the
writ
against
him
would
vindicate
the
majesty
of
the
law
but
now
the
prisoners
were
at
carthage
where
justice
morrison
lived
and
could
have
appeared
before
him
and
were
willing
to
do
so
they
were
taken
before
another
justice
in
order
to
avoid
increasing
the
excitement
the
prisoners
admitted
there
was
sufficient
cause
to
be
bound
over
to
appear
at
the
next
term
of
the
circuit
court
for
hancock
county
the
bonds
amounted
to
seven
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
justice
smith
dismissed
his
court
without
taking
any
action
on
the
charge
of
treason
under
which
the
brothers
smith
were
still
held
but
about
eight
the
same
evening
constable
bettisworth
appeared
at
their
lodgings
at
the
hamilton
house
and
insisted
on
their
going
to
jail
the
prophet
demanded
to
see
the
copy
of
the
mittimus
which
was
at
first
denied
but
upon
his
counsel
messrs
woods
reid
informing
the
constable
that
the
accused
were
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
a
justice
before
they
could
be
sent
to
jail
to
the
surprise
of
all
present
he
produced
a
mittimus
issued
by
justice
smith
it
stated
that
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
were
under
arrest
charged
with
treason
and
have
been
so
the
paper
read
brought
before
me
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
and
for
said
county
for
trial
at
the
seat
of
justice
hereof
which
trial
has
been
necessarily
postponed
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
material
witnesses
now
this
mittimus
so
far
as
it
related
to
the
prisoners
appearing
before
justice
smith
was
an
infamous
falsehood
unless
as
lawyer
reid
says
in
the
account
he
published
of
these
proceedings
unless
the
prisoners
could
have
appeared
before
the
justice
being
present
in
person
or
by
the
same
representation
of
the
case
was
made
to
me
by
lawyer
james
woods
who
at
the
time
was
associated
with
reid
as
the
prophet
counsel
whom
i
met
in
the
summer
of
in
iowa
and
from
whom
at
that
time
i
received
a
detailed
account
of
the
proceedings
joseph
and
his
counsel
and
his
friends
protested
most
vigorously
against
this
unlawful
proceeding
but
to
no
avail
smith
finding
his
mittimus
unlawful
appealed
to
the
governor
as
to
what
he
should
do
to
which
the
governor
answered
you
have
the
carthage
greys
at
your
command
that
hint
was
sufficient
what
the
had
illegally
begun
the
same
person
as
must
with
unlawful
force
consummate
yet
when
this
same
governor
was
appealed
to
for
protection
against
this
unhallowed
as
well
as
unlawful
proceeding
he
expressed
himself
as
being
very
sorry
the
circumstance
had
occurred
but
he
really
could
not
interfere
with
the
civic
powers
elder
john
taylor
went
to
the
governor
and
reminded
him
of
his
pledges
of
protection
elder
taylor
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
at
the
course
taken
and
told
the
governor
that
if
they
were
to
be
subject
to
mob
rule
and
to
be
dragged
contrary
to
law
to
prison
at
the
instance
of
every
scoundrel
whose
oath
could
be
bought
for
a
dram
of
whisky
his
protection
availed
very
little
and
they
had
miscalculated
the
executive
promises
in
the
meantime
a
drunken
rabble
had
collected
in
the
street
in
front
of
the
hamilton
house
and
captain
dunn
with
some
twenty
men
came
to
guard
the
prisoners
to
the
jail
the
prophet
friends
stood
by
him
in
these
trying
times
and
followed
him
through
the
excited
crowd
in
the
direction
of
the
jail
stephen
markham
walked
on
one
side
of
the
prophet
and
his
brother
hyrum
and
dan
jones
on
the
other
and
with
their
walking
sticks
kept
back
the
rabble
which
several
times
broke
through
the
guard
while
elder
taylor
willard
richards
and
john
fullmer
walked
behind
them
the
jail
was
reached
in
safety
and
the
prisoners
given
in
charge
of
george
stigall
who
first
put
them
into
the
criminal
cell
but
afterwards
gave
them
the
more
comfortable
quarters
known
as
the
debtors
apartment
when
night
came
the
prisoners
and
their
friends
stretched
themselves
out
on
the
floor
of
the
old
jail
and
so
passed
the
night
of
the
governor
ford
represents
in
his
history
of
illinois
that
these
men
were
placed
in
prison
to
protect
them
from
the
rabble
but
says
not
a
word
about
the
protests
of
the
prisoners
against
being
thrust
into
jail
or
the
illegal
means
employed
in
putting
them
there
in
the
forenoon
of
the
a
lengthy
interview
took
place
between
governor
ford
and
joseph
in
which
the
whole
cause
of
the
trouble
was
reviewed
the
causes
leading
up
to
the
destruction
of
the
press
calling
out
the
legion
on
which
the
charge
of
treason
was
based
and
all
other
affairs
connected
with
the
difficulties
governor
ford
condemned
the
action
of
the
city
council
but
the
course
pursued
by
that
body
was
ably
defended
by
joseph
and
showed
that
even
if
they
had
been
wrong
in
following
the
course
they
had
taken
it
was
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
decide
and
not
a
thing
for
mobs
to
settle
in
conclusion
the
prophet
told
the
governor
that
he
considered
himself
unsafe
in
carthage
as
the
town
was
swarming
with
men
who
had
openly
sworn
to
take
his
life
he
understood
the
governor
contemplated
going
to
nauvoo
accompanied
by
the
militia
to
investigate
certain
charges
about
counterfeiting
the
united
states
currency
and
if
possible
secure
the
dies
and
other
implements
used
in
manufacturing
it
and
joseph
demanded
his
freedom
that
he
might
go
with
him
the
governor
promised
him
that
he
should
go
the
false
mittimus
on
which
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
were
thrust
into
prison
ordered
the
jailor
to
keep
them
in
custody
until
discharged
by
due
course
of
law
but
on
the
afternoon
of
the
frank
worrell
appeared
before
the
jail
in
command
of
the
carthage
greys
and
demanded
that
the
prisoners
be
delivered
up
to
the
constable
to
be
taken
before
justice
smith
for
trial
against
this
proceeding
the
jailor
protested
as
the
prisoners
were
placed
in
his
keeping
until
discharged
by
due
course
of
law
and
not
at
the
demand
of
a
constable
or
military
despot
but
by
threats
amounting
to
intimidation
worrell
compelled
the
jailor
against
his
conviction
of
duty
to
surrender
the
prisoners
to
him
meantime
a
mob
had
gathered
at
the
door
of
the
jail
and
seeing
that
things
had
assumed
a
threatening
aspect
the
prophet
stepped
into
the
crowd
locked
arms
with
one
of
the
worst
mobocrats
and
with
his
brother
hyrum
on
the
other
arm
and
followed
by
his
faithful
friends
proceeded
to
the
court
house
he
had
been
unlawfully
thrust
into
prison
and
as
illegally
dragged
out
of
it
and
exposed
to
imminent
danger
among
his
worst
enemies
the
counsel
for
the
brothers
smith
asked
for
a
continuance
until
the
next
day
as
they
were
without
witnesses
not
having
been
notified
when
they
would
come
to
trial
a
continuance
was
granted
until
noon
the
next
day
a
new
mittimus
was
made
out
and
the
prisoners
committed
again
to
prison
their
old
quarters
but
after
the
prisoners
were
again
lodged
in
jail
and
without
consulting
either
them
or
their
counsel
justice
smith
changed
the
time
of
trial
from
noon
on
the
until
the
this
change
was
made
in
consequence
of
a
decision
reached
by
governor
ford
and
his
military
council
to
march
all
his
troops
into
nauvoo
except
a
company
of
fifty
of
the
carthage
greys
that
would
be
detailed
to
guard
the
prisoners
so
smith
acting
it
will
be
remembered
in
the
double
capacity
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
captain
of
the
carthage
greys
as
a
justice
altered
the
date
of
the
return
of
the
subpoenas
and
excused
the
court
until
the
that
as
a
captain
of
a
company
of
militia
he
might
attend
the
military
train
entering
nauvoo
in
triumph
the
evening
of
the
was
spent
very
pleasantly
by
the
prisoners
and
their
friends
john
taylor
willard
richards
john
fullmer
stephen
markham
and
dan
jones
hyrum
occupied
the
principal
part
of
the
time
in
reading
accounts
from
the
book
of
mormon
of
the
deliverance
of
god
servants
from
prison
and
in
commenting
upon
them
with
a
view
doubtless
of
cheering
his
brother
joseph
since
the
prophet
had
expressed
himself
as
having
a
presentiment
of
uneasiness
as
to
his
safety
that
he
had
never
before
experienced
when
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
late
at
night
all
retired
to
rest
except
willard
richards
who
by
the
flickering
flame
of
a
tallow
candle
continued
his
work
of
writing
out
some
important
documents
joseph
and
hyrum
occupied
the
only
bedstead
in
the
room
and
their
friends
lay
side
by
side
on
the
mattresses
spread
out
on
the
floor
sometime
after
midnight
a
single
gun
was
fired
near
the
prison
elder
richards
started
in
his
chair
and
joseph
rose
from
the
bed
where
he
had
been
lying
and
stretched
himself
out
on
the
floor
between
fullmer
and
jones
lay
your
head
on
my
arm
for
a
pillow
brother
john
said
the
prophet
to
fullmer
as
he
kindly
placed
his
arm
under
that
head
soon
all
became
quiet
except
in
a
low
tone
fullmer
and
the
prophet
continued
to
talk
of
presentiments
the
latter
had
received
of
approaching
death
i
would
like
to
see
my
family
again
said
he
and
i
would
to
god
that
i
could
preach
to
the
saints
in
nauvoo
once
more
fullmer
tried
to
cheer
him
by
saying
he
thought
he
would
have
that
privilege
many
times
again
all
was
silent
and
everybody
apparently
asleep
but
joseph
turned
to
dan
jones
and
was
heard
to
say
are
you
afraid
to
die
to
which
the
one
addressed
said
has
that
time
come
think
you
engaged
in
such
a
cause
i
do
not
think
death
would
have
many
terrors
and
then
the
prophet
said
you
will
yet
see
wales
his
native
land
and
fill
the
mission
appointed
you
before
you
die
so
passed
away
the
night
preceding
the
day
which
saw
enacted
that
tragedy
which
robbed
earth
of
two
of
the
noblest
men
that
ever
lived
upon
it
as
the
morning
light
struggled
through
the
windows
of
carthage
jail
the
prisoners
and
their
friends
awoke
and
the
prophet
required
dan
jones
to
go
down
stairs
and
enquire
of
the
guard
about
the
gun
that
was
fired
in
the
night
what
the
meaning
of
it
was
etc
jones
went
accordingly
and
found
frank
worrell
in
command
of
the
guard
and
the
answer
he
received
to
his
inquiry
was
this
we
have
had
too
much
trouble
to
get
old
joe
here
to
let
him
ever
escape
alive
and
unless
you
want
to
die
with
him
you
had
better
leave
before
sun
down
and
you
are
not
a
d
n
bit
better
than
him
for
taking
his
part
and
you
see
that
i
can
prophesy
better
than
old
joe
for
neither
he
nor
his
brother
nor
anyone
who
will
remain
with
them
will
see
the
sun
set
today
this
answer
jones
related
to
joseph
who
told
him
to
go
to
the
governor
at
once
and
report
the
words
of
the
guard
on
his
way
to
the
governor
quarters
at
the
hamilton
house
jones
passed
a
crowd
of
men
who
were
being
addressed
by
a
person
unknown
to
him
he
paused
long
enough
to
hear
these
words
our
troops
will
be
discharged
this
morning
in
obedience
to
orders
and
for
a
sham
we
will
leave
the
town
but
when
the
governor
and
the
mcdonough
troops
have
left
for
nauvoo
this
forenoon
we
will
return
and
kill
those
men
if
we
have
to
tear
the
jail
down
applause
these
words
and
what
the
captain
of
the
guard
said
were
faithfully
reported
to
governor
ford
in
reply
to
which
he
said
you
are
unnecessarily
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
your
friends
sir
the
people
are
not
that
cruel
angered
at
such
an
answer
the
following
conversation
occurred
the
smith
are
american
citizens
and
have
surrendered
themselves
to
your
excellency
upon
your
pledging
your
honor
for
their
safety
they
are
also
master
masons
and
as
such
i
demand
of
you
the
protection
of
their
lives
if
you
do
not
this
i
have
but
one
more
desire
and
that
is
if
you
leave
their
lives
in
the
hands
of
those
men
to
be
sacrificed
what
is
that
sir
it
is
that
the
almighty
will
preserve
my
life
to
a
proper
time
and
place
that
i
may
testify
that
you
have
been
timely
warned
of
their
danger
the
governor
manifested
some
excitement
during
this
conversation
turning
pale
at
the
masonic
warning
jones
gave
him
the
effect
however
was
but
momentary
jones
returned
to
the
jail
after
his
conversation
with
the
governor
but
was
denied
admission
he
then
returned
to
the
governor
to
secure
a
pass
and
arrived
at
the
square
just
as
that
officer
was
disbanding
the
militia
it
is
customary
when
the
militia
has
been
called
together
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
laws
or
to
suppress
an
insurrection
to
dismiss
the
respective
companies
in
charge
of
their
several
commanders
to
be
marched
home
and
there
be
disbanded
but
in
this
instance
the
governor
disbanded
all
the
troops
except
the
carthage
greys
whom
it
appears
he
had
selected
to
guard
the
jail
and
the
mcdonough
troops
who
were
to
accompany
him
to
nauvoo
governor
ford
himself
in
his
history
of
illinois
represents
that
there
were
about
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
of
the
militia
at
carthage
and
some
five
hundred
at
warsaw
as
the
disbanded
militia
left
the
square
they
acted
in
a
boisterous
manner
shouting
that
they
would
only
go
a
short
distance
from
town
and
then
come
back
and
kill
old
joe
and
hyrum
as
soon
as
the
governor
was
far
enough
out
of
town
dan
jones
called
the
attention
of
the
governor
to
these
threats
but
he
ignored
them
i
suppose
these
are
the
threats
of
which
governor
ford
himself
speaks
in
his
history
of
these
unfortunate
events
when
he
says
i
had
heard
of
some
threats
being
made
but
none
of
an
attack
upon
the
prisoners
whilst
in
jail
these
threats
seemed
to
be
made
by
individuals
not
acting
in
concert
they
were
no
more
than
the
bluster
which
might
have
been
expected
and
furnished
no
indication
of
numbers
combining
for
this
or
any
other
purpose
it
will
be
remembered
that
governor
ford
expressed
a
determination
to
march
with
all
his
forces
into
nauvoo
and
joseph
having
heard
of
this
in
the
interview
at
the
jail
before
alluded
to
expressed
a
desire
to
accompany
him
and
the
governor
promised
him
he
should
go
this
promise
the
governor
failed
to
keep
because
a
council
of
his
officers
convinced
him
that
to
take
the
prophet
with
him
to
nauvoo
would
be
highly
inexpedient
and
dangerous
indeed
the
whole
plan
of
marching
all
his
forces
into
nauvoo
was
abandoned
the
expedition
had
been
formed
for
the
purpose
of
striking
terror
into
the
hearts
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
by
a
display
of
military
force
in
their
midst
and
to
satisfy
the
wishes
of
the
speaking
of
this
projected
of
nauvoo
and
the
preparations
made
for
the
start
governor
ford
says
i
observed
that
some
of
the
people
became
more
and
more
excited
and
inflammatory
the
further
the
preparations
were
advanced
occasional
threats
came
to
my
ears
of
destroying
the
city
and
murdering
or
expelling
the
inhabitants
i
had
no
objection
to
ease
the
terrors
of
the
people
by
such
a
display
of
force
and
was
most
anxious
also
to
search
for
the
alleged
apparatus
for
making
counterfeit
money
and
in
fact
to
inquire
into
all
the
charges
made
against
that
people
if
i
could
have
been
assured
of
my
command
against
mutiny
and
insubordination
but
i
gradually
learned
to
my
entire
satisfaction
that
there
was
a
plan
to
get
the
troops
into
nauvoo
and
there
to
begin
the
war
probably
by
some
of
our
own
party
or
some
of
the
seceding
mormons
taking
advantage
of
the
night
to
fire
on
our
own
force
and
then
lay
it
on
the
mormons
i
was
satisfied
that
there
were
those
amongst
us
fully
capable
of
such
an
act
hoping
that
in
the
alarm
bustle
and
confusion
of
a
militia
camp
the
truth
could
not
be
discovered
and
that
it
might
lead
to
the
desired
collision
such
are
the
reasons
assigned
by
governor
ford
for
abandoning
his
plan
of
marching
all
his
forces
into
nauvoo
if
he
could
persuade
himself
to
believe
that
he
had
those
under
his
command
who
would
resort
to
the
means
he
himself
alludes
to
in
the
foregoing
to
bring
about
a
collision
with
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
that
he
was
fearful
that
his
whole
command
would
mutiny
when
once
in
the
city
of
the
saints
it
is
unfortunate
for
the
fame
of
governor
ford
that
his
fears
could
not
be
aroused
for
the
safety
of
his
prisoners
who
were
left
at
the
mercy
of
those
same
militia
forces
of
which
he
himself
was
distrustful
the
only
barrier
between
them
and
the
fury
of
this
being
a
guard
made
up
of
their
bitterest
enemies
to
satisfy
the
the
governor
told
them
he
would
take
a
small
force
with
him
and
go
in
search
of
counterfeiting
apparatus
and
would
make
a
speech
to
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
detailing
to
them
the
consequences
of
any
acts
of
violence
on
their
part
for
nauvoo
however
some
of
his
officers
expressed
fears
that
the
smiths
would
be
killed
and
the
governor
informs
us
that
he
reduced
his
forces
leaving
part
of
his
command
on
the
way
and
pushed
with
all
speed
for
nauvoo
that
he
might
make
a
speech
to
the
people
there
and
return
to
carthage
that
night
giving
up
the
idea
of
remaining
several
days
to
search
for
counterfeiting
apparatus
and
making
inquiries
into
the
charges
against
the
mormon
people
leaving
him
to
pursue
to
his
journey
to
nauvoo
i
return
to
note
the
events
which
took
place
at
the
jail
cyrus
wheelock
visited
carthage
jail
early
on
the
morning
of
the
and
when
he
departed
for
nauvoo
to
secure
witnesses
and
documents
for
the
impending
trial
on
the
charge
of
treason
he
left
with
the
prisoners
an
revolver
before
leaving
carthage
however
he
went
to
governor
ford
he
leaving
carthage
before
the
governor
started
and
expressed
his
fears
for
the
safety
of
the
prisoners
he
then
started
for
nauvoo
but
with
a
heavy
heart
dan
jones
was
sent
to
quincy
by
the
prophet
with
a
letter
to
lawyer
browning
applying
for
his
professional
services
in
the
pending
trial
the
letter
was
handed
to
jones
by
babbitt
the
former
not
being
allowed
to
enter
the
jail
after
leaving
it
in
the
morning
the
mob
being
informed
by
the
guard
of
the
letter
set
up
the
cry
that
joe
smith
was
sending
an
order
by
jones
to
the
nauvoo
legion
to
come
and
rescue
him
a
crowd
surrounded
jones
and
demanded
the
letter
but
the
fearless
welshman
refused
to
give
it
up
whereupon
some
were
in
favor
of
forcing
it
from
him
but
there
was
a
disagreement
in
the
crowd
about
that
and
while
they
were
discussing
the
point
jones
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
stephen
markham
being
seen
on
the
streets
in
the
afternoon
a
number
of
the
carthage
greys
captured
him
put
him
on
his
horse
and
forced
him
out
of
town
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
notwithstanding
he
held
a
pass
from
the
governor
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
jail
at
pleasure
this
left
but
elders
richards
and
taylor
with
the
prophet
and
his
brother
in
the
prison
they
passed
the
afternoon
in
pleasant
conversation
reading
and
singing
elder
taylor
sand
a
hymn
entitled
a
poor
wayfaring
man
of
grief
a
peculiarly
plaintive
piece
of
poetry
and
admirably
suited
to
their
circumstances
a
poor
wayfaring
man
of
grief
hath
often
crossed
me
on
the
way
who
sued
so
humbly
for
relief
that
i
could
never
answer
nay
i
had
not
power
to
ask
his
name
whereto
he
went
or
whence
he
came
yet
there
was
something
in
his
eye
that
won
my
love
i
knew
not
why
once
when
my
scanty
meal
was
spread
he
entered
not
a
word
he
spake
just
perishing
for
want
of
bread
i
gave
him
all
he
blessed
it
brake
and
ate
but
gave
me
part
again
mine
was
an
angel
portion
then
for
while
i
fed
with
eager
haste
the
crust
was
manna
to
my
taste
i
spied
him
where
a
fountain
burst
clear
from
the
rock
his
strength
was
gone
the
heedless
water
mocked
his
thirst
he
heard
it
saw
it
hurrying
on
i
ran
and
raised
the
up
thrice
from
the
stream
he
drained
my
cup
dipped
and
returned
it
running
i
drank
and
never
thirsted
more
was
night
the
floods
were
out
it
blew
a
aloof
i
heard
his
voice
abroad
and
flew
to
bid
him
welcome
to
my
roof
i
warmed
and
clothed
and
cheered
my
guest
and
laid
him
on
my
couch
to
rest
then
made
the
earth
my
bed
and
seemed
in
eden
garden
while
i
dreamed
stript
wounded
beaten
nigh
to
death
i
found
him
by
the
highway
side
i
roused
his
pulse
brought
back
his
breath
revived
his
spirit
and
supplied
wine
oil
refreshment
he
was
healed
i
had
myself
a
wound
concealed
but
from
that
hour
forgot
the
smart
and
peace
bound
up
my
broken
heart
in
prison
i
saw
him
next
condemned
to
meet
a
traitor
doom
at
morn
the
tide
of
lying
tongues
i
stemmed
and
honored
him
shame
and
scorn
my
friendship
utmost
zeal
to
try
he
asked
if
i
for
him
would
die
the
flesh
was
weak
my
blood
ran
chill
but
the
free
spirit
cried
i
will
then
in
a
moment
to
my
view
the
stranger
darted
from
disguise
the
tokens
in
his
hands
i
knew
the
savior
stood
before
mine
eyes
he
spake
and
my
poor
name
he
named
of
me
thou
hast
not
been
ashamed
these
deeds
shall
thy
memorial
be
fear
not
thou
didst
them
unto
me
late
in
the
afternoon
stigall
the
jailor
came
in
and
suggested
that
they
would
be
safer
in
the
cells
joseph
told
him
they
would
go
in
after
supper
turning
to
elder
richards
the
prophet
said
if
we
go
to
the
cell
will
you
go
in
with
us
brother
joseph
you
did
not
ask
me
to
cross
the
river
with
you
referring
to
the
time
when
they
crossed
the
mississippi
for
the
rocky
mountains
you
did
not
ask
me
to
come
to
carthage
you
did
not
ask
me
to
come
to
jail
with
you
and
do
you
think
i
would
forsake
you
now
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
if
you
are
condemned
to
be
hung
for
treason
i
will
be
hung
in
your
stead
and
you
shall
go
free
but
you
can
not
i
will
though
this
conversation
took
place
a
little
after
five
and
very
soon
afterwards
the
attack
was
made
on
the
jail
it
appears
that
a
crowd
came
from
the
direction
of
warsaw
that
evidently
had
an
understanding
with
the
carthage
greys
and
the
members
of
that
company
on
guard
at
the
jail
since
the
latter
without
question
had
but
blank
cartridges
in
their
guns
and
the
attack
was
made
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
company
encamped
but
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
on
the
public
square
and
they
made
no
effort
whatever
to
prevent
the
assaults
on
the
prison
the
guard
at
the
jail
played
their
part
well
they
fired
blank
shots
at
the
advancing
mob
or
discharged
their
pieces
in
the
air
they
were
overpowered
and
the
prison
was
in
the
hands
of
an
infuriated
mob
a
rush
was
made
for
the
room
where
the
prisoners
were
lodged
and
a
shower
of
lead
was
sent
in
through
the
door
and
the
windows
from
those
on
the
outside
as
no
account
that
i
could
possibly
write
would
equal
that
given
by
an
of
the
whole
transaction
i
here
quote
entire
the
account
of
the
tragedy
by
elder
willard
richards
as
it
appeared
in
the
and
soon
after
the
event
under
the
caption
two
minutes
in
jail
a
shower
of
musket
balls
was
thrown
up
the
stairway
against
the
door
of
the
prison
in
the
second
story
followed
by
many
rapid
footsteps
while
generals
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
taylor
and
myself
who
were
in
the
front
chamber
closed
the
door
of
our
room
against
the
entry
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
placed
ourselves
against
it
there
being
no
lock
on
the
door
and
no
catch
that
was
unsealable
the
door
is
a
common
panel
and
as
soon
as
we
heard
the
feet
at
the
stair
head
a
ball
was
sent
through
the
door
which
passed
between
us
and
showed
that
our
enemies
were
desperadoes
and
we
must
change
our
position
general
joseph
smith
taylor
and
myself
sprang
back
to
the
front
part
of
the
room
general
hyrum
smith
retreated
across
the
chamber
directly
in
front
of
and
facing
the
door
a
ball
was
sent
through
the
door
which
hit
hyrum
on
the
side
of
his
nose
when
he
fell
backwards
extending
at
full
length
without
moving
his
feet
from
the
holes
in
his
vest
the
day
was
warm
and
no
one
had
their
coats
on
but
myself
pantaloons
drawers
and
shirt
it
appeared
that
a
ball
must
have
been
thrown
from
without
through
the
window
which
entered
the
back
of
his
right
side
and
passing
through
lodged
against
his
watch
which
was
in
the
right
vest
pocket
completely
pulverizing
the
crystal
and
face
tearing
off
the
hands
and
mashing
the
whole
body
of
the
watch
at
the
same
instant
the
ball
from
the
door
entered
his
nose
as
he
struck
the
floor
he
exclaimed
emphatically
am
a
dead
joseph
looked
towards
him
and
responded
dear
brother
and
opening
the
door
two
or
three
inches
with
his
left
hand
discharged
one
barrel
of
a
the
pistol
left
him
by
wheelock
at
random
in
the
entry
from
whence
a
ball
grazed
hyrum
breast
and
entering
his
throat
passed
into
his
head
while
other
muskets
were
aimed
at
him
as
some
balls
hit
him
joseph
continued
snapping
his
revolver
round
the
casing
of
the
door
into
the
space
as
before
three
barrels
of
which
missed
fire
while
taylor
with
a
walking
stick
stood
by
his
side
and
knocked
down
the
bayonets
and
muskets
which
were
constantly
discharging
through
the
doorway
while
i
stood
by
him
ready
to
lend
any
assistance
with
another
stick
but
could
not
come
within
striking
distance
without
going
directly
in
front
of
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
when
the
revolver
failed
we
had
no
more
firearms
and
expected
an
immediate
rush
of
the
mob
and
the
doorway
full
of
muskets
half
way
in
the
room
and
no
hope
but
instant
death
from
within
taylor
rushed
into
the
window
which
is
some
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
when
his
body
was
nearly
on
a
balance
a
ball
from
the
door
within
entered
his
leg
and
a
ball
from
without
struck
his
watch
a
patent
lever
in
his
vest
pocket
near
his
left
breast
and
smashed
it
into
pie
leaving
the
hands
standing
at
five
sixteen
minutes
and
seconds
the
force
of
which
ball
threw
him
back
on
the
floor
and
he
rolled
under
the
bed
which
stood
by
his
side
where
he
lay
motionless
the
mob
continuing
to
fire
upon
him
cutting
away
a
piece
of
flesh
from
his
left
hip
as
large
as
a
man
hand
and
were
hindered
only
by
my
knocking
down
their
muzzles
with
a
stick
while
they
continued
to
reach
their
guns
into
the
room
probably
left
handed
and
aimed
their
discharge
so
far
round
as
almost
to
reach
us
in
the
corner
of
the
room
to
where
we
retreated
and
dodged
and
there
i
commenced
the
attack
with
my
stick
joseph
attempted
as
a
last
resort
to
leap
the
same
window
from
which
taylor
fell
when
two
balls
pierced
him
from
the
door
and
one
entered
his
right
breast
from
without
and
he
fell
outward
exclaiming
lord
my
as
his
feet
went
out
of
the
window
my
head
went
in
the
balls
whistling
all
round
he
fell
on
his
left
side
a
dead
man
at
this
instant
the
cry
was
raised
leaped
the
and
the
mob
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
entry
ran
out
i
withdrew
from
the
window
thinking
it
no
use
to
leap
out
on
a
hundred
bayonets
then
round
smith
body
not
satisfied
with
this
i
again
reached
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
watched
some
seconds
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
life
regardless
of
my
own
determined
to
see
the
end
of
him
i
loved
being
fully
satisfied
that
he
was
dead
with
a
hundred
men
near
his
body
and
more
coming
round
the
corner
of
the
jail
and
expecting
a
return
to
our
room
i
rushed
toward
the
prison
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
through
the
entry
from
whence
the
firing
had
proceeded
to
learn
if
the
doors
into
the
prison
were
open
when
near
the
entry
taylor
cried
out
i
pressed
my
way
until
i
found
all
doors
unbarred
returning
instantly
caught
taylor
under
my
arm
and
rushed
up
the
stairs
into
the
dungeon
or
inner
prison
stretched
him
on
the
floor
and
covered
him
with
a
bed
in
such
a
manner
as
not
likely
to
be
perceived
expecting
an
immediate
return
of
the
mob
i
said
to
taylor
this
is
a
hard
case
to
lay
you
on
the
floor
but
if
your
wounds
are
not
fatal
i
want
you
to
live
to
tell
the
story
i
expected
to
be
shot
the
next
moment
and
stood
before
the
doors
awaiting
the
onset
there
was
however
no
further
onset
made
on
the
jail
three
minutes
after
the
attack
was
commenced
hyrum
smith
lay
stretched
out
on
the
floor
of
the
prison
dead
elder
taylor
lay
not
far
from
him
savagely
wounded
the
prophet
was
lying
by
the
side
of
the
well
curb
just
under
the
window
from
which
he
had
attempted
to
leap
the
plighted
faith
of
a
state
was
broken
its
honor
trailed
in
the
dust
and
a
stain
of
innocent
blood
affixed
to
its
escutcheon
which
shall
remain
a
disgrace
forever
when
it
was
known
that
the
prophet
was
killed
consternation
seemed
to
seize
the
mob
and
they
fled
for
the
most
part
in
the
direction
of
warsaw
in
the
utmost
confusion
such
wild
confusion
reigned
in
carthage
that
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
elder
richards
could
obtain
any
help
or
refreshments
for
elder
taylor
at
last
the
wounded
man
was
taken
to
the
hamilton
house
and
his
wounds
dressed
the
bodies
of
joseph
and
hyrum
were
also
taken
to
the
same
place
and
laid
out
meantime
governor
ford
had
gone
to
nauvoo
where
he
arrived
some
time
in
the
afternoon
several
thousands
assembled
to
hear
his
speech
that
he
went
there
to
deliver
and
he
insulted
them
by
assuming
that
all
that
their
worst
enemies
had
said
of
them
was
true
and
threatened
them
with
most
dire
calamities
he
himself
in
his
history
of
illinois
says
the
people
manifested
some
impatience
and
anger
when
he
referred
to
the
misconduct
alleged
against
them
by
their
enemies
and
well
they
might
for
baser
falsehoods
were
never
put
in
circulation
to
slander
a
people
the
governor
was
invited
to
stay
all
night
but
he
refused
and
left
the
city
about
in
the
evening
for
carthage
his
escort
riding
full
speed
up
main
street
performing
the
sword
exercise
they
passed
the
temple
and
so
left
the
city
three
miles
out
of
governor
and
his
escort
met
george
grant
and
david
bettisworth
riding
toward
nauvoo
like
madmen
with
the
sad
news
of
the
death
of
joseph
and
hyrum
the
governor
took
them
back
with
him
to
grant
house
one
and
one
half
miles
east
of
carthage
that
the
news
might
not
reach
nauvoo
until
he
had
had
time
to
have
the
county
records
removed
from
the
court
house
and
warn
the
people
of
carthage
to
flee
as
he
expected
an
immediate
attack
from
the
nauvoo
legion
and
that
the
whole
country
would
be
laid
waste
after
being
taken
back
to
carthage
george
grant
mounted
another
horse
and
rode
that
night
with
the
awful
news
to
nauvoo
on
the
arrival
of
governor
ford
at

willard
richards
after
the
note
was
prepared
the
governor
wrote
an
order
to
the
people
of
nauvoo
to
defend
themselves
and
then
about
one
in
the
morning
went
out
on
the
public
square
and
advised
all
present
to
disperse
as
he
expected
the
mormons
would
be
so
exasperated
that
they
would
burn
the
town
upon
this
the
people
of
carthage
fled
in
all
directions
and
the
governor
and
his
took
flight
in
the
direction
of
quincy
but
there
was
no
uprising
and
violence
on
the
part
of
the
saints
the
next
day
the
bodies
of
the
murdered
men
were
taken
to
nauvoo
about
one
mile
east
of
the
temple
on
mullholland
street
they
were
met
by
the
people
in
solemn
procession
under
the
direction
of
the
city
marshal
neither
tongue
nor
pen
can
ever
describe
the
scene
of
sorrow
and
lamentation
which
was
there
beheld
the
love
of
joseph
and
hyrum
for
the
saints
was
unbounded
and
it
had
begotten
in
the
people
an
affection
for
them
that
was
equally
dear
and
unselfish
they
lived
in
the
hearts
of
the
saints
and
thousands
would
have
laid
down
their
lives
willingly
to
have
saved
theirs
with
their
beloved
and
trusted
leaders
thus
brutally
snatched
from
them
under
such
circumstances
of
cruelty
and
official
treachery
imagine
if
you
can
the
mingled
feelings
of
sorrow
and
righteous
indignation
that
struggled
in
every
heart
and
sought
expression
arriving
at
the
mansion
the
bodies
were
taken
into
it
to
be
prepared
for
burial
and
elder
willard
richards
and
others
addressed
some
eight
or
ten
thousand
of
the
people
in
the
open
air
the
saints
were
advised
to
keep
the
peace
elder
richards
stated
that
he
had
pledged
his
honor
and
his
life
for
their
conduct
when
the
multitude
heard
that
notwithstanding
the
sense
of
outraged
justice
under
which
they
labored
and
this
cruel
invasion
of
the
rights
of
liberty
and
life
in
the
very
midst
of
their
grief
and
excitement
with
the
means
in
their
right
hands
to
wreak
a
terrible
vengeance
they
voted
to
a
man
to
trust
to
the
law
to
deal
with
the
assassins
and
if
that
failed
them
they
would
call
upon
god
to
avenge
them
of
their
wrongs
history
records
few
actions
so
sublime
as
this
and
it
stands
to
this
day
a
testimony
of
the
devotion
of
the
saints
to
law
and
order
the
like
of
which
is
not
paralleled
in
the
history
of
our
country
if
in
the
world
footnotes
the
manner
of
this
incident
about
the
revolt
of
the
carthage
greys
is
thus
related
in
gregg
history
of
hancock
county
it
seems
that
after
the
mcdonough
regiment
had
been
disbanded
and
were
about
to
return
home
they
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
prisoners
joseph
and
hyrum
the
wish
was
reasonable
and
as
the
easiest
mode
of
gratifying
it
they
were
drawn
up
in
line
and
general
deming
with
the
two
prisoners
one
on
each
arm
and
the
greys
as
an
escort
passed
along
the
line
of
troops
deming
introducing
them
as
general
joseph
smith
and
general
hyrum
smith
of
the
nauvoo
legion
the
greys
not
aware
that
this
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
mcdonough
men
and
not
satisfied
to
be
made
an
escort
to
such
a
display
exhibited
signs
of
dissatisfaction
and
finally
gave
vent
to
their
feelings
by
hisses
and
groans
as
a
punishment
for
this
offense
they
were
afterward
ordered
under
arrest
in
the
meantime
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
company
as
a
detachment
of
the
troops
was
being
detailed
for
the
purpose
of
putting
the
general
order
into
execution
the
officer
in
command
of
the
greys
addressed
them
a
few
words
and
then
said
will
you
submit
to
an
arrest
for
so
trifling
an
offense
was
the
unanimous
response
load
your
pieces
with
ball
was
the
sullen
order
in
the
meantime
some
explanations
had
been
made
which
permitted
general
deming
to
countermand
the
order
of
arrest
and
the
greys
were
quietly
marched
back
to
their
encampment
this
account
says
nothing
of
the
fact
that
it
was
generally
known
that
the
night
before
governor
ford
had
promised
all
the
troops
a
view
of
generals
smith
and
the
greys
had
been
in
revolt
at
general
headquarters
before
the
party
including
joseph
and
hyrum
reached
the
mcdonough
troops
moreover
i
was
informed
by
colonel
ferris
when
in
carthage
in
investigating
these
matters
that
when
word
arrived
in
that
place
that
joseph
smith
would
surrender
himself
to
the
authorities
if
the
governor
would
pledge
him
protection
and
a
fair
trial
the
governor
made
a
speech
to
the
mixed
multitude
of
troops
and
citizens
in
which
he
stated
the
proposition
of
the
smiths
and
wanted
to
know
if
they
would
sustain
him
in
pledging
them
protection
to
which
they
responded
in
the
affirmative
there
was
some
talk
too
of
sending
the
greys
as
a
posse
to
escort
the
smiths
into
nauvoo
against
this
proceeding
general
deming
protested
and
told
governor
ford
that
the
pledge
of
protection
made
by
the
crowd
and
the
troops
was
not
to
be
depended
upon
it
was
insincere
and
that
the
lives
of
the
smiths
were
not
to
be
trusted
to
the
greys
the
governor
however
disregarded
the
warning
of
general
deming
colonel
ferris
was
present
at
this
in
view
of
the
great
civil
war
which
a
few
years
later
desolated
the
land
it
is
clear
that
the
above
utterance
was
prophetic
ford
history
of
illinois
for
this
conversation
in
as
reported
by
elder
john
taylor
who
was
present
see
appendix
iv
this
prediction
was
fulfilled
elder
dan
jones
went
on
a
mission
to
wales
starting
on
the
of
august
in
company
with
wilford
woodruff
and
performed
a
most
wonderful
mission
in
his
native
land
ford
history
of
illinois
page
it
is
said
that
after
joseph
fell
by
the
well
curb
under
the
window
from
which
he
attempted
to
leap
he
was
set
up
against
that
curb
and
colonel
levi
williams
ordered
four
men
to
fire
at
him
which
they
did
it
is
then
said
that
a
ruffian
bareheaded
and
barefooted
his
pantaloons
rolled
up
above
his
knees
and
his
shirt
sleeves
above
his
elbows
approached
the
dead
prophet
in
hand
with
the
intention
it
is
supposed
of
severing
the
head
from
the
body
he
had
raised
his
hand
to
strike
when
a
light
so
sudden
and
powerful
flashed
upon
the
bloody
scene
that
the
mob
was
the
arm
of
the
mutilator
of
the
dead
fell
powerless
at
his
side
the
four
muskets
of
those
who
fired
at
him
fell
to
the
ground
while
their
owners
stood
like
marble
statues
unable
to
move
or
join
their
companions
in
the
hurried
and
confused
retreat
they
were
then
making
and
colonel
williams
had
to
call
upon
some
of
the
retreating
mob
to
carry
them
away
the
history
is
based
upon
the
statements
of
wm
daniels
blackenberry
and
a
miss
graham
but
how
far
their
statements
are
correct
i
have
no
means
of
judging
when
at
carthage
i
became
acquainted
with
hamilton
son
of
the
hamilton
who
kept
the
hamilton
house
referred
to
several
times
in
these
pages
and
who
just
previous
to
the
murder
of
the
prophet
and
his
brother
had
been
enrolled
as
a
member
of
the
company
of
carthage
greys
at
the
time
of
the
attack
on
the
jail
he
was
on
the
public
square
and
at
once
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
jail
and
was
in
full
view
of
it
all
the
time
he
saw
the
prophet
appear
at
the
window
and
half
leap
and
half
fall
out
of
it
after
which
the
mob
fled
precipitously
according
to
his
statement
there
was
no
such
an
occurrence
as
setting
the
body
against
the
well
etc
he
claims
to
have
been
about
the
first
who
went
to
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
afterwards
rendered
some
assistance
in
removing
elder
taylor
and
the
bodies
of
the
martyrs
to
his
father
house
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
nothing
of
all
this
is
recorded
by
willard
richards
and
it
smacks
too
much
of
the
fanciful
there
is
too
much
deliberation
in
it
to
believe
it
to
be
the
action
of
a
chapter
xxxix
confusion
choosing
a
leader
the
saints
at
nauvoo
were
now
as
sheep
without
a
shepherd
they
had
never
contemplated
such
a
crisis
as
this
that
their
prophet
would
be
taken
from
them
had
not
entered
their
minds
although
in
the
closing
days
of
his
career
he
had
frequently
spoken
of
his
fate
if
again
he
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
on
the
of
june
five
days
preceding
his
death
at
the
conclusion
of
the
consultation
with
several
of
nauvoo
leading
citizens
and
at
which
time
it
was
decided
that
the
safest
thing
for
himself
and
hyrum
to
do
was
to
go
west
he
remarks
in
his
journal
i
told
stephen
markham
that
if
i
and
hyrum
were
ever
taken
again
we
should
be
massacred
or
i
was
not
a
prophet
of
god
when
the
cowardly
appeal
made
to
him
by
false
friends
to
return
to
nauvoo
after
he
had
crossed
the
mississippi
on
his
way
to
the
west
was
under
consideration
by
himself
and
a
few
friends
he
said
to
his
brother
hyrum
smith
brother
hyrum
you
are
the
oldest
what
shall
we
do
hyrum
replied
let
us
go
back
and
give
ourselves
up
and
see
the
thing
out
if
you
go
back
replied
the
prophet
i
shall
go
with
you
but
we
shall
be
butchered
then
again
after
it
was
determined
to
adopt
the
course
suggested
by
hyrum
and
the
party
was
on
the
way
to
the
river
where
they
were
to
take
boats
for
the
nauvoo
side
the
prophet
lingered
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
talking
with
rockwell
those
in
advance
shouted
to
them
to
come
on
joseph
replied
it
is
no
use
to
hurry
for
we
are
going
back
to
be
slaughtered
on
arriving
at
nauvoo
hyrum
too
seemed
to
have
been
impressed
with
a
sense
of
their
approaching
fate
for
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
when
the
first
start
was
made
for
carthage
he
read
the
following
significant
passage
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
turned
down
the
leaf
upon
it
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
give
unto
the
gentiles
grace
that
they
might
have
charity
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
if
they
have
not
charity
it
mattereth
not
unto
you
thou
hast
been
faithful
wherefore
thy
garments
are
clean
and
because
thou
hast
seen
thy
weakness
thou
shalt
be
made
strong
even
to
the
sitting
down
in
the
place
which
i
have
prepared
in
the
mansions
of
my
father
and
now
i
bid
farewell
unto
the
gentiles
yea
and
also
unto
my
brethren
whom
i
love
until
we
shall
meet
before
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
when
all
men
shall
know
that
my
garments
are
not
spotted
with
your
blood
i
have
already
quoted
the
pathetic
words
of
the
prophet
on
meeting
captain
dunn
company
of
militia
four
miles
out
from
carthage
when
he
said
i
am
going
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
but
i
am
calm
as
a
summer
morning
i
have
a
conscience
void
of
offense
towards
god
and
towards
all
men
i
shall
die
innocent
and
it
shall
yet
be
said
of
me
he
was
murdered
in
cold
blood
i
have
also
related
the
circumstance
of
his
lingering
to
look
at
his
farm
as
he
left
nauvoo
for
the
last
time
and
clearly
intimated
that
he
would
never
see
it
again
but
notwithstanding
these
very
plain
intimations
concerning
his
approaching
death
the
saints
apparently
could
not
comprehend
them
they
did
not
sense
them
and
when
his
death
so
sudden
and
pitiful
did
come
it
scarcely
seemed
possible
to
them
that
it
had
taken
place
they
were
unprepared
for
it
and
as
i
say
were
now
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
sidney
rigdon
the
prophet
first
counselor
was
in
pittsburg
pennsylvania
he
had
removed
from
nauvoo
to
pittsburg
notwithstanding
in
a
revelation
from
god
he
had
been
required
to
make
his
home
in
nauvoo
and
stand
in
his
office
and
calling
of
counselor
and
spokesman
to
the
prophet
the
truth
is
that
from
the
expulsion
of
the
saints
from
missouri
in
sidney
rigdon
had
been
of
but
little
service
either
to
the
church
or
to
the
prophet
as
a
counselor
he
was
a
man
of
admitted
ability
as
an
orator
but
lacked
discretion
a
man
of
fervid
imagination
but
of
inferior
judgment
ambitious
of
place
and
honor
but
without
that
steadiness
of
purpose
and
other
qualities
of
soul
which
in
time
secure
them
in
the
early
years
of
the
church
he
suffered
much
for
the
cause
of
god
but
he
also
complained
much
especially
was
this
the
case
in
respect
to
the
hardships
endured
in
missouri
and
subsequently
of
his
poverty
and
illness
at
nauvoo
this
habit
of
complaining
doubtless
did
much
to
deprive
him
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
for
at
times
it
bordered
upon
blasphemy
more
than
once
he
was
heard
to
say
that
jesus
christ
was
a
fool
in
suffering
as
compared
with
himself
having
lost
in
part
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
lord
his
interest
in
the
church
and
its
work
waned
and
after
the
settlement
at
nauvoo
he
was
seldom
seen
in
the
councils
of
the
priesthood
moreover
it
was
known
that
he
was
in
sympathy
and
even
in
communication
with
some
of
the
avowed
enemies
of
joseph
among
others
with
that
arch
traitor
john
bennett
who
was
plotting
the
overthrow
of
both
joseph
and
the
church
it
was
doubtless
these
considerations
which
led
joseph
to
make
an
effort
to
get
rid
of
sidney
rigdon
as
counselor
at
the
october
conference
in
on
that
occasion
the
prophet
represented
to
the
church
that
such
had
been
the
course
of
sidney
rigdon
that
he
considered
it
no
longer
his
duty
to
sustain
him
as
his
counselor
hyrum
smith
however
pleaded
the
cause
of
his
and
so
strongly
urged
the
saints
to
deal
mercifully
with
sidney
rigdon
that
when
the
question
of
sustaining
him
was
presented
to
the
conference
the
saints
voted
in
his
favor
i
have
thrown
him
off
my
shoulders
and
you
have
again
put
him
on
me
said
joseph
you
may
carry
him
but
i
will
not
and
so
confident
was
he
that
sidney
rigdon
would
continue
to
fail
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
that
he
ordained
elder
amasa
lyman
to
succeed
him
both
as
counselor
and
spokesman
some
of
the
elders
did
not
understand
how
elder
lyman
could
be
ordained
to
succeed
elder
rigdon
as
the
church
had
voted
to
try
him
another
year
elder
joseph
smith
was
requested
to
give
an
explanation
why
said
he
by
the
same
rule
that
samuel
anointed
david
to
be
king
over
israel
while
saul
was
yet
crowned
please
read
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
first
samuel
elder
smith
explanation
though
short
proved
a
quietus
to
all
their
rising
conjectures
notwithstanding
all
his
fair
promises
of
amendment
sidney
rigdon
continued
neglectful
of
his
high
duties
and
if
for
a
time
his
enthusiasm
revived
as
it
seemed
to
at
the
april
conference
following
it
was
as
the
flickering
flame
of
a
tallow
dip
only
not
the
steady
rays
of
the
sun
he
longed
to
return
to
the
east
and
notwithstanding
the
word
of
the
lord
commanding
him
to
make
his
home
at
nauvoo
he
frequently
talked
with
joseph
about
going
to
pittsburg
to
live
and
finally
obtained
his
consent
to
go
there
and
take
his
family
with
him
and
as
i
said
before
he
was
there
when
the
martyrdom
occurred
william
law
who
had
been
the
prophet
second
counselor
was
in
open
apostasy
and
rebellion
against
him
he
had
been
and
was
the
associate
of
a
corrupt
band
of
men
bent
on
the
destruction
of
the
prophet
prompted
by
a
spirit
of
mercy
the
april
conference
of
had
passed
without
taking
action
against
either
william
law
or
any
of
the
other
apostates
but
on
the
eighteenth
of
april
at
a
council
of
the
priesthood
when
six
of
the
twelve
apostles
were
present
william
law
and
several
other
apostates
were
excommunicated
from
the
church
and
later
william
law
undertook
the
organization
of
a
church
after
the
pattern
of
the
church
of
christ
but
it
was
a
miserable
failure
the
twelve
apostles
were
nearly
all
absent
in
the
eastern
states
on
missions
and
although
messengers
were
sent
to
call
them
to
nauvoo
immediately
after
the
prophet
martyrdom
it
would
be
some
time
before
they
could
arrive
so
that
it
was
a
time
of
general
anxiety
and
depression
it
was
in
the
midst
of
such
circumstances
as
these
that
sidney
rigdon
arrived
in
nauvoo
and
demanded
that
he
be
appointed
guardian
of
the
church
he
ignored
the
members
of
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
who
were
in
the
city
elders
willard
richards
john
taylor
and
parley
pratt
he
conferred
with
elder
william
marks
president
of
the
stake
of
nauvoo
and
at
once
began
agitating
the
question
of
appointing
a
guardian
to
the
church
he
arrived
in
nauvoo
on
saturday
the
third
of
august
next
day
he
harangued
the
saints
who
assembled
in
the
grove
near
the
temple
upon
the
necessity
of
appointing
a
guardian
to
build
up
the
church
to
the
martyred
prophet
and
in
the
afternoon
meeting
urged
william
marks
to
make
a
special
appointment
for
the
saints
to
assemble
on
the
following
tuesday
for
that
purpose
elder
marks
was
in
sympathy
with
sidney
rigdon
but
for
some
reason
he
refused
to
make
the
appointment
for
tuesday
but
made
it
for
thursday
the
eighth
of
august
this
was
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
since
a
sufficient
number
of
the
twelve
to
make
a
majority
of
that
quorum
arrived
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
and
of
course
they
were
in
time
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
to
be
held
on
the
eighth
the
day
previous
to
that
meeting
however
the
seventh
of
august
the
twelve
called
a
meeting
of
the
high
council
and
high
priests
before
which
they
called
on
sidney
rigdon
to
make
a
statement
of
his
purposes
and
relate
the
revelation
he
claimed
to
have
received
at
pittsburg
which
prompted
his
journey
to
nauvoo
in
substance
he
replied
that
the
object
of
his
visit
was
to
offer
himself
to
the
saints
as
a
guardian
that
it
had
been
shown
to
him
in
vision
at
pittsburg
that
the
church
must
be
built
up
to
joseph
the
martyr
that
all
the
blessings
the
saints
could
receive
would
be
through
their
late
prophet
that
no
man
could
be
a
successor
to
joseph
that
the
church
was
not
disorganized
though
the
head
was
gone
that
he
had
been
commanded
to
come
to
nauvoo
and
see
that
the
church
was
governed
properly
and
propose
himself
to
be
a
guardian
to
the
people
to
this
elder
brigham
young
replied
i
do
not
care
who
leads
this
church
even
though
it
were
ann
lee
but
one
thing
i
must
know
and
that
is
what
god
says
about
it
i
have
the
keys
and
the
means
of
obtaining
the
mind
of
god
on
the
subject
joseph
conferred
upon
our
heads
all
the
keys
and
powers
belonging
to
the
apostleship
which
he
himself
held
before
he
was
taken
away
and
no
man
nor
set
of
men
can
get
between
joseph
and
the
twelve
in
this
world
or
in
the
world
to
come
how
often
has
joseph
said
to
the
twelve
i
have
laid
the
foundation
and
you
must
build
thereon
for
upon
your
shoulders
the
kingdom
rests
the
next
day
was
the
one
appointed
by
sidney
rigdon
for
the
church
to
assemble
and
choose
a
guardian
the
attendance
was
large
as
intense
interest
had
been
awakened
upon
the
subject
to
be
considered
sidney
rigdon
addressed
the
assembly
setting
forth
his
claim
to
the
guardianship
of
the
church
he
had
full
opportunity
to
present
his
case
and
for
one
hour
and
a
half
spoke
without
interruption
but
despite
his
reputation
as
an
orator
he
failed
to
convince
the
saints
that
he
was
sent
of
god
as
soon
as
sidney
rigdon
had
closed
his
speech
elder
brigham
young
arose
and
made
a
few
remarks
it
was
on
that
occasion
that
he
was
transfigured
before
the
people
so
that
through
him
the
saints
heard
the
voice
and
felt
the
presence
of
their
departed
leader
george
cannon
who
was
present
on
that
occasion
says
if
joseph
had
risen
from
the
dead
and
again
spoken
in
their
hearing
the
effect
could
not
have
been
more
startling
than
it
was
to
many
present
at
that
meeting
it
was
the
voice
of
joseph
himself
and
not
only
was
it
the
voice
of
joseph
which
was
heard
but
it
seemed
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
as
if
it
were
the
very
person
of
joseph
which
stood
before
them
a
more
wonderful
and
miraculous
event
than
was
wrought
that
day
in
the
presence
of
that
congregation
we
never
heard
of
the
lord
gave
his
people
a
testimony
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
as
to
who
was
the
man
chosen
to
lead
them
they
both
saw
and
heard
with
their
natural
eyes
and
ears
and
the
words
which
were
uttered
came
accompanied
by
the
convincing
power
of
god
to
their
hearts
and
they
were
filled
with
the
spirit
and
with
great
joy
there
had
been
gloom
and
in
some
hearts
probably
doubt
and
uncertainty
but
now
it
was
plain
to
all
that
here
was
the
man
upon
whom
the
lord
had
bestowed
the
necessary
authority
to
act
in
their
midst
in
joseph
stead
on
that
occasion
brigham
young
seemed
to
be
transformed
and
a
change
such
as
that
we
read
of
in
the
scriptures
as
happening
to
the
prophet
elisha
when
elijah
was
translated
in
his
presence
seemed
to
have
taken
place
with
him
the
mantle
of
the
prophet
joseph
had
been
left
for
brigham
the
people
said
one
to
another
the
spirit
of
joseph
rests
on
brigham
they
knew
that
he
was
the
man
chosen
to
lead
them
and
they
honored
him
accordingly
as
far
as
our
observation
went
we
were
only
a
boy
at
the
time
the
people
were
divided
into
three
classes
from
the
time
of
the
death
of
joseph
up
to
this
meeting
of
which
we
speak
one
class
felt
clearly
and
understandingly
that
president
brigham
young
was
the
man
whose
right
it
was
to
preside
he
being
the
president
of
the
twelve
apostles
and
that
body
being
through
the
death
of
joseph
and
hyrum
the
presiding
quorum
of
the
church
another
class
were
not
quite
clear
as
to
who
would
be
called
to
preside
but
they
felt
very
certain
that
sidney
rigdon
was
not
the
man
they
did
not
believe
that
god
would
choose
a
coward
and
traitor
to
lead
his
people
to
both
of
which
characters
they
believed
rigdon
had
a
claim
the
third
class
and
we
think
its
members
were
few
was
composed
of
those
who
had
no
clear
views
one
way
or
the
other
they
were
undecided
in
their
feelings
with
very
few
exceptions
then
the
people
returned
to
their
homes
from
that
meeting
filled
with
great
rejoicing
all
uncertainty
and
anxiety
were
removed
they
had
heard
the
voice
of
the
shepherd
and
they
knew
it
in
the
journal
of
elder
william
staines
of
that
date
the
following
statement
is
recorded
brigham
young
said
i
will
tell
you
who
your
leaders
or
guardians
will
be
the
twelve
i
at
their
head
this
was
with
a
voice
like
the
voice
of
the
prophet
joseph
i
thought
it
was
he
and
so
did
thousands
who
heard
it
this
was
very
satisfactory
to
the
people
and
a
vote
was
taken
to
sustain
the
twelve
in
their
office
which
with
a
few
dissenting
voices
was
passed
president
wilford
woodruff
describing
the
event
says
when
brigham
young
arose
and
commenced
speaking
if
i
had
not
seen
him
with
my
own
eyes
there
is
no
one
that
could
have
convinced
me
that
it
was
not
joseph
smith
and
anyone
can
testify
to
this
who
was
acquainted
with
these
two
men
the
remarks
of
elder
young
during
which
he
was
transfigured
before
the
people
closed
the
forenoon
meeting
when
in
the
afternoon
the
church
again
assembled
elder
young
addressed
them
at
some
length
on
the
subject
of
appointing
a
leader
for
the
church
representing
the
claims
of
the
twelve
as
the
quorum
having
the
right
to
act
in
the
absence
of
the
late
following
are
some
quotations
from
a
summary
of
his
speech
taken
down
at
the
time
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
for
the
first
time
in
your
lives
for
the
first
time
in
the
kingdom
of
god
in
the
nineteenth
century
without
a
prophet
at
our
head
do
i
step
forth
to
act
in
my
calling
in
connection
with
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
as
apostles
of
jesus
christ
unto
this
generation
apostles
whom
god
has
called
by
revelation
through
the
prophet
joseph
who
are
ordained
and
anointed
to
bear
off
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
all
the
world
if
any
man
thinks
he
has
influence
among
this
people
to
lead
away
a
party
let
him
try
it
and
he
will
find
out
that
there
is
a
power
with
the
apostles
which
will
carry
them
off
victorious
through
all
the
world
and
build
up
and
defend
the
church
and
kingdom
of
god
if
the
people
want
president
rigdon
to
lead
them
they
may
have
him
but
i
say
unto
you
that
the
quorum
of
the
twelve
have
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
all
the
world
the
twelve
were
appointed
by
the
finger
of
god
here
is
brigham
have
his
knees
ever
faltered
have
his
lips
ever
quivered
here
is
heber
and
the
rest
of
the
twelve
an
independent
body
who
have
the
keys
of
the
priesthood
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
god
to
deliver
to
all
the
world
this
is
true
so
help
me
god
they
stand
next
to
joseph
and
are
as
the
first
presidency
of
the
church
you
must
not
appoint
any
man
at
our
head
if
you
should
the
twelve
must
ordain
him
you
can
not
appoint
a
man
at
our
head
but
if
you
do
want
any
other
man
or
men
to
lead
you
take
them
and
we
will
go
our
way
to
build
up
the
kingdom
in
all
the
world
brother
joseph
the
prophet
has
laid
the
foundation
for
a
grand
work
and
we
will
build
upon
it
you
have
never
seen
the
quorums
built
one
upon
another
there
is
an
almighty
foundation
laid
and
we
can
build
a
kingdom
such
as
there
never
was
in
the
world
we
can
build
a
kingdom
faster
than
the
devil
can
kill
the
saints
off
now
if
you
want
sidney
rigdon
or
william
law
to
lead
you
or
anybody
else
you
are
welcome
to
them
but
i
tell
you
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
no
man
can
put
another
between
the
twelve
and
the
prophet
joseph
why
because
joseph
was
their
file
leader
and
he
has
committed
into
their
hands
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
in
this
last
dispensation
for
all
the
world
do
put
a
thread
between
the
priesthood
and
god
elder
amasa
lyman
spoke
in
support
of
the
twelve
and
then
sidney
rigdon
was
granted
the
privilege
of
speaking
he
declined
personally
but
called
on
elder
phelps
to
speak
in
his
behalf
elder
phelps
while
evidently
having
some
sympathy
with
elder
rigdon
supported
the
claims
of
the
twelve
after
further
discussion
elder
young
arose
to
put
the
question
as
to
whether
the
church
would
sustain
the
twelve
or
sidney
rigdon
i
do
not
ask
you
to
take
my
counsel
or
advice
alone
but
every
one
of
you
act
for
yourselves
but
if
brother
rigdon
is
the
person
you
want
to
lead
you
vote
for
him
but
not
unless
you
intend
to
follow
him
and
support
him
as
you
did
joseph
and
i
would
say
the
same
of
the
twelve
do
make
a
covenant
to
support
them
unless
you
intend
to
abide
by
their
counsel
i
want
every
man
before
he
enters
into
a
covenant
to
know
what
he
is
going
to
do
but
we
want
to
know
if
this
people
will
support
the
priesthood
in
the
name
of
israel
god
if
you
say
you
will
do
so
elder
young
was
then
about
to
put
the
question
to
the
assembled
quorums
as
to
whether
they
wanted
elder
rigdon
for
a
leader
when
at
the
request
of
the
latter
the
question
on
supporting
the
twelve
as
the
presiding
quorum
in
the
church
was
first
put
in
the
following
manner
do
the
church
want
and
is
it
their
only
desire
to
sustain
the
twelve
as
the
first
presidency
of
this
people
if
the
church
want
the
twelve
to
stand
as
the
head
of
this
kingdom
in
all
the
world
stand
next
to
joseph
walk
up
into
their
calling
and
hold
the
keys
of
this
kingdom
every
man
every
woman
every
quorum
is
now
put
in
order
and
you
are
now
the
sole
controllers
of
it
all
that
are
in
favor
of
this
in
all
the
congregation
of
the
saints
manifest
it
by
holding
up
the
right
hand
there
was
a
universal
vote
if
there
are
any
of
a
contrary
mind
every
man
and
every
woman
who
does
not
want
the
twelve
to
preside
lift
up
your
hands
in
like
manner
no
hands
up
this
supersedes
the
other
question
and
trying
it
by
quorums
this
disposed
of
sidney
rigdon
he
had
full
opportunity
to
present
his
case
before
the
church
the
saints
had
full
opportunity
and
liberty
to
vote
for
him
had
they
wanted
him
for
their
leader
but
they
rejected
him
and
sustained

the

the
court
began
its
session
on
monday
the
there
had
been
rumors
industriously
circulated
that
the
old
citizens
intended
to
rally
and
interpose
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
court
and
considerable
anxiety
was
felt
the
judge
in
his
charge
to
the
grand
jury
alluded
to
this
rumor
and
said
he
was
glad
to
see
that
no
such
demonstration
was
made
he
charged
them
to
do
their
duty
in
the
case
likely
to
come
before
them
and
leave
the
consequences
his
charge
gave
general
satisfaction
there
was
a
rumor
that
a
lot
of
mormons
and
indians
were
encamped
near
the
town
and
this
rumor
occasioned
considerable
uneasiness
orders
were
issued
to
investigate
the
facts
turned
out
to
be
that
a
number
of
mormons
had
come
down
from
nauvoo
to
attend
court
and
had
gone
into
camp
to
save
expense
as
to
the
indians
it
was
ascertained
that
a
company
of
them
had
gone
through
the
county
on
their
way
to
iowa
for
some
purpose
unknown
but
the
two
facts
had
no
connection
with
each
other
on
tuesday
the
grand
jury
began
their
work
and
on
saturday
about
noon
they
brought
into
court
two
bills
of
indictment
against
nine
individuals
one
for
the
murder
of
joseph

the

for

on
announcement

most
of

appeared
and
asked
for
an

this
mcconnell
objected
to
on
the
grounds
of
not
being
ready
his
witnesses
before
the
grand

had
departed
without
being
recognized
and
besides
elliot
had
gone
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
causes
should
be
postponed
until

term
and
that
no
should
issue
from

try

experiment
of

the
almost
certainty
of
being
rejected

or

parties
the

among
a
list
of
nine
asked
by
defendants
counsel
were
given
and
probably
had
most
influence
on
the
verdict
that
where
the
evidence
is
circumstantial
admitting
all
to
be
proven
that
the
evidence
tends
to
prove
if
then
the
jury
can
make
any
supposition
consistent
with
the
facts
by
which
the
murder
might
have
been
committed
without
the
agency
of
the
defendants
it
will
be
their
duty
to
make
that
supposition
and
find
defendants
not
guilty
that
in
making
up
their
verdict
they
will
exclude
from
their
consideration
all
that
was
said
by

that
whenever
the
probability
is
of
a

and
limited
nature
whether
in

or
to
or
any
rate
is
immaterial
it
can
not

made
the
ground
of
conviction
for
to
act
upon
it
in
any
case
would
be
to
decide
that
for
the
sake
of
convicting
many
criminals
the
life
of
one
innocent
man
might
be
sacrificed
starkie
same
defendants
for
murder
of
hyrum
smith
were
requested
to
enter
into
recognizance
of
each
with
fourteen
sureties
to
the

term
at
said
term
case
was
called
and
elliot
and

not
answering
the
cause
was
dismissed
for
want
of
prosecution
and
defendants
discharged
colonel
john
hay
in
the
for
december
published
an
article
on
this
subject
although
but
a
mere
boy
at
the
time
of
this
trial
he
had
within
his
reach
sources
of
correct
information
he
was
a
member
of
the
state
department
subsequently
he
says
the
case
was
closed
there
was
not
a
man
on
the
jury
in
the
court
in
the
county
that
did
not
know
the
defendants
had
done
the
murder
but
it
was
not
proven
and
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
was
right
in
law
the
elisors
presented
men
before
were
found
ignorant
enough
and
indifferent
enough
to
act
as
jurors
the
fact
is
the
trial
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
a
farce
the
law
had
been
outraged
the
honor
of
the
state
betrayed
her
plighted
faith
was
shamefully
broken
and
there
was
not
virtue
enough
in
the
people
to
demand
its
vindication
nor
is
this
at
all
an
exaggerated
statement
of
the
matter
the
governor
of
illinois
himself
thomas
ford
admits
all
that
is
here
said
of
the
atrocious
deed
itself
and
his
determination
to
bring
the
murderers
to
justice
he
says
had
determined
from
the
first
that
some
of
the
ringleaders
in
the
foul
murder
of
the
smiths
should
be
brought
to
trial
if
these
men
had
been
the
incarnation
of
satan
himself
as
was
believed
by
many
their
murder
was
a
foul
and
treacherous
action
alike
disgraceful
to
those
who
perpetrated
the
crime
to
the
state
and
to
the
governor
whose
word
had
been
pledged
for
the
protection
of
the
prisoners
in
jail
and
which
had
been
so
shamefully
violated
and
required
that
the
most
vigorous
means
should
be
used
to
bring
the
assassins
to
speaking
of
the
trial
governor
ford
says
accordingly
i
employed
able
lawyers
to
hunt
up
the
testimony
procure
indictments
and
prosecute
the
offenders
a
trial
was
had
before
judge
young
in
the
summer
of
the
sheriff
and
panel
of
jurors
selected
by
the
mormon
court
were
set
aside
for
prejudice
and
elisors
were
appointed
to
select
a
new
jury
one
friend
of
the
mormons
and
one
were
appointed
for
this
purpose
but
as
more
than
a
thousand
men
had
assembled
under
arms
at
the
court
to
keep
away
the
mormons
and
their
friends
the
jury
was
made
up
of
these
military
followers
of
the
court
who
all
swore
that
they
had
never
formed
or
expressed
any
opinion
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused
the
mormons
had
one
principal
witness
who
was
with
the
troops
at
warsaw
had
marched
with
them
until
they
disbanded
heard
their
consultations
went
before
them
to
carthage
and
saw
them
murder
the
smiths
but
before
the
trial
came
on
they
induced
him
to
become
a
mormon
and
being
much
more
anxious
for
the
glorification
of
the
prophet
than
to
avenge
his
death
the
mormons
made
him
publish
a
pamphlet
giving
an
account
of
the
murder
in
which
he
professed
to
have
seen
a
bright
and
shining
light
descend
upon
the
head
of
joe
smith
to
strike
some
of
the
conspirators
with
blindness
and
that
he
heard
supernatural
voices
in
the
air
confirming
his
mission
as
a
prophet
having
published
this
in
a
book
he
was
compelled
to
swear
to
it
in
court
which
of
course
destroyed
the
credit
of
his
evidence
this
witness
was
afterwards
expelled
by
the
mormons
but
no
doubt
they
will
cling
to
his
evidence
in
favor
of
the
divine
mission
of
the
prophet
many
other
witnesses
were
examined
who
knew
the
facts
but
under
the
influence
of
the
demoralization
of
faction
denied
all
knowledge
of
them
it
has
been
said
that
faction
may
find
men
honest
but
it
scarcely
ever
leaves
them
so
this
was
verified
to
the
letter
in
the
history
of
the
mormon
quarrel
the
accused
were
all
acquitted
during
the
progress
of
these
trials
the
judge
was
compelled
to
permit
the
courthouse
to
be
filled
and
surrounded
by
armed
bands
who
attended
court
to
browbeat
and
overawe
the
administration
of
justice
the
judge
himself
was
in
a
duress
and
informed
me
that
he
did
not
consider
his
life
secure
any
part
of
the
time
the
consequence
was
that
the
crowd
had
everything
their
own
way
the
lawyers
for
the
defense
defended
their
clients
by
a
long
and
elaborate
attack
upon
the
governor
the
armed
mob
stamped
with
their
feet
and
yelled
their
approbation
at
every
sarcastic
and
smart
thing
that
was
said
and
the
judge
was
not
only
forced
to
hear
it
but
to
lend
it
a
kind
of
approval
and
now
in
conclusion
as
promised
in
the
footnote
on
this
page
i
quote
the
statement
of
the
martyrdom
as
vouched
for
by
the
church
and
published
in
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
to
seal
the
testimony
of
this
book
and
the
book
of
mormon
we
announce
the
martyrdom
of
joseph
smith
the
prophet
and
hyrum
smith
the
patriarch
they
were
shot
in
carthage
jail
on
the
of
june
about
five
by
an
armed
mob
painted
black
of
from
to
persons
hyrum
was
shot
first
and
fell
calmly
exclaiming
i
am
a
dead
man
joseph
leaped
from
the
window
and
was
shot
dead
in
the
attempt
exclaiming
o
lord
my
god
they
were
both
shot
after
they
were
dead
in
a
brutal
manner
and
both
received
four
balls
john
taylor
and
willard
richards
two
of
the
twelve
were
the
only
persons
in
the
room
at
the
time
the
former
was
wounded
in
a
savage
manner
with
four
balls
but
has
since
recovered
the
latter
through
the
providence
of
god
escaped
without
even
a
hole
in
his
robe
joseph
smith
the
prophet
and
seer
of
the
lord
has
done
more
save
jesus
only
for
the
salvation
of
men
in
this
world
than
any
other
man
that
ever
lived
in
it
in
the
short
space
of
twenty
years
he
has
brought
forth
the
book
of
mormon
which
he
translated
by
the
gift
and
power
of
god
and
has
been
the
means
of
publishing
it
on
two
continents
has
sent
the
fullness
of
the
everlasting
gospel
which
it
contained
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
has
brought
forth
the
revelations
and
commandments
which
compose
this
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
and
many
other
wise
documents
and
instructions
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
of
men
gathered
many
thousands
of
the
saints
founded
a
great
city
and
left
a
fame
and
name
that
can
not
be
slain
he
lived
great
and
he
died
great
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
his
people
and
like
most
of
the
lord
anointed
in
ancient
times
has
sealed
his
mission
and
his
works
with
his
own
blood
and
so
has
his
brother
hyrum
in
life
they
were
not
divided
and
in
death
they
were
not
separated
when
joseph
went
to
carthage
to
deliver
himself
up
to
the
pretended
requirements
of
the
law
two
or
three
days
previous
to
his
assassination
he
said
i
am
going
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
but
i
am
calm
as
a
summer
morning
i
have
a
conscience
void
of
offense
towards
god
and
towards
all
men
i
shall
die
innocent
and
it
shall
yet
be
said
of
me
he
was
murdered
in
cold
blood
the
same
morning
after
hyrum
had
made
ready
to
go
shall
it
be
said
to
the
slaughter
yes
for
so
it
was
he
read
the
following
paragraph
near
the
close
of
the
fifth
chapter
of
ether
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
turned
down
the
leaf
upon
it
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
give
unto
the
gentiles
grace
that
they
might
have
charity
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
if
they
have
not
charity
it
mattereth
not
unto
you
thou
hast
been
faithful
wherefore
thy
garments
are
clean
and
because
thou
hast
seen
thy
weakness
thou
shalt
be
made
strong
even
unto
the
sitting
down
in
the
place
which
i
have
prepared
in
the
mansions
of
my
father
and
now
i
bid
farewell
unto
the
gentiles
yea
and
also
unto
my
brethren
whom
i
love
until
we
shall
meet
before
the
of
christ
where
all
men
shall
know
that
my
garments
are
not
spotted
with
your
blood
the
testators
are
now
dead
and
their
testament
is
in
force
hyrum
smith
was
years
old
february
and
joseph
smith
was
in
december
and
henceforward
their
names
will
be
classed
among
the
martyrs
of
religion
and
the
reader
in
every
nation
will
be
reminded
that
the
book
of
mormon
and
this
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
of
the
church
cost
the
best
blood
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
bring
them
forth
for
the
salvation
of
a
ruined
world
and
that
if
the
fire
can
scathe
a
for
the
glory
of
god
how
easy
it
will
burn
up
the
dry
trees
to
purify
the
vineyard
of
corruption
they
lived
for
glory
they
died
for
glory
and
glory
is
their
eternal
reward
from
age
to
age
shall
their
names
go
down
to
posterity
as
gems
for
the
sanctified
they
were
innocent
of
any
crime
as
they
had
often
been
proved
before
and
were
only
confined
in
jail
by
the
conspiracy
of
traitors
and
wicked
men
and
their
on
the
floor
of
carthage
jail
is
a
broad
seal
affixed
to
mormonism
that
can
not
be
rejected
by
any
court
on
earth
and
their
on
the
escutcheon
of
the
state
of
illinois
with
the
broken
faith
of
the
state
as
pledged
by
the
governor
is
a
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
everlasting
gospel
that
all
the
world
can
not
impeach
and
their
on
the
banner
of
liberty
and
on
the
of
the
united
states
is
an
ambassador
for
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
that
will
touch
the
hearts
of
honest
men
among
all
nations
and
their
with
the
innocent
blood
of
all
the
martyrs
under
the
altar
that
john
saw
will
cry
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
till
he
avenges
that
blood
on
the

xli
the
exodus
the
fall
of
nauvoo
it
is
thought
by
some
that
our
enemies
would
be
satisfied
with
my
destruction
but
i
tell
you
that
as
soon
as
they
have
shed
my
blood
they
will
thirst
for
the
blood
of
every
man
in
whose
heart
dwells
a
single
spark
of
the
spirit
of
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
the
opposition
of
these
men
is
moved
by
the
spirit
of
the
adversary
of
all
righteousness
it
is
not
only
to
destroy
me
but
every
man
and
woman
who
dares
believe
the
doctrines
that
god
hath
inspired
me
to
teach
in
this
generation
such
were
the
words
of
the
prophet
joseph
smith
to
the
nauvoo
legion
on
the
eighteenth
of
june
and
the
action
of
the
old
citizens
of
hancock
and
the
surrounding
counties
subsequent
to
the
murder
of
the
prophet
prove
how
truly
inspired
were
the
words
we
have
quoted
for
no
sooner
did
they
discover
that
the
work
which
joseph
had
begun
refused
to
die
with
him
than
they
renewed
hostilities
and
sought
by
every
means
their
wicked
hearts
could
devise
to
harass
and
destroy
those
who
devoted
their
energies
to
the
consummation
of
the
work
which
had
been
started
the
mockery
of
a
trial
given
those
who
had
murdered
the
prophets
emboldened
the
enemies
of
the
saints
for
they
saw
justice
powerless
to
vindicate
outraged
law
and
that
with
impunity
they
could
prey
upon
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
whom
it
would
seem
their
hatred
had
selected
for
a
sacrifice
thieves
and
blacklegs
generally
saw
the
opportunity
of
having
their
crimes
charged
upon
an
innocent
people
and
established
themselves
in
the
vicinity
of
nauvoo
though
principally
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river
and
all
the
thefts
and
acts
of
violence
committed
by
those
renegades
were
charged
up
to
the
account
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
too
gladly
believed
by
the
people
in
the
surrounding
counties
not
only
were
the
charges
of
theft
and
robbery
made
against
the
sainst
but
they
were
also
accused
of
hiding
from
justice
any
and
all
criminals
who
came
into
their
midst
that
nauvoo
in
short
was
a
rendezvous
for
outlaws
counterfeiters
and
desperate
men
generally
these
charges
led
the
city
council
on
the
thirteenth
of
january
to
investigate
the
allegations
and
a
series
of
resolutions
were
adopted
stating
that
the
charges
of
theft
for
the
most
part
were
fabrications
of
their
enemies
bent
on
ruining
the
reputation
of
the
city
and
defied
those
who
made
the
charges
to
sustain
with
proof
a
single
case
where
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
had
screened
criminals
from
justice
the
council
also
extended
an
invitation
to
all
who
had
reasons
to
believe
that
their
stolen
property
was
concealed
in
nauvoo
to
come
and
make
diligent
search
for
it
and
pledged
them
the
assistance
of
the
council
to
hunt
out
crime
and
put
away
everything
that
could
give
rise
to
even
a
suspicion
of
concealing
criminals
the
mayor
was
authorized
to
increase
the
force
of
police
if
necessary
to
five
hundred
and
the
people
were
called
upon
to
redouble
their
diligence
in
preventing
criminals
from
coming
among
them
and
all
such
persons
as
soon
as
discovered
were
to
be
given
up
to
the
officers
of
the
law
the
next
day
the
action
of
the
city
council
was
submitted
to
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
they
approved
of
it
fifty
delegates
were
chosen
and
sent
into
the
surrounding
counties
to
disabuse
the
public
mind
relative
to
the
false
accusations
made
against
the
saints
and
to
ask
their
in
ridding
the
country
of
the
counterfeiters
and
thieves
which
infested
it
but
all
these
efforts
were
fruitless
the
falsehoods
of
their
enemies
outweighed
the
truths
of
the
saints
and
prejudice
more
cruel
than
hell
itself
hardened
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
illinois
against
the
appeals
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
made
them
deaf
to
all
entreaties
for
justice
twice
during
the
summer
of
governor
ford
himself
went
to
nauvoo
to
investigate
these
charges
against
her
people
and
when
he
came
to
deal
with
the
mormon
troubles
in
his
message
to
the
legislature
that
fall
after
speaking
of
the
charges
made
he
said
justice
however
requires
me
to
say
that
i
have
investigated
the
charge
of
promiscuous
stealing
and
find
it
to
be
greatly
exaggerated
i
could
not
ascertain
that
there
were
a
greater
proportion
of
thieves
in
that
community
than
in
any
other
of
the
same
number
of
inhabitants
and
perhaps
if
the
city
of
nauvoo
were
compared
with
louis
or
any
other
western
city
the
proportion
would
not
be
so
great
the
prejudice
not
to
say
bitterness
of
governor
ford
against
the
saints
would
rob
his
statement
of
any
suspected
exaggeration
favorable
to
them
nor
is
governor
ford
voice
the
only
one
which
vindicates
the
character
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
the
deputy
sheriff
of
hancock
county
exonerated
the
mormon
people
from
any
participation
in
the
thefts
perpetrated
in
the
surrounding
country
he
testified
that
stolen
property
was
brought
through
the
country
nauvoo
passed
over
the
river
to
the
iowa
side
and
taken
into
the
interior
where
it
was
concealed
he
also
stated
that
there
were
some
five
or
six
persons
in
nauvoo
who
were
assisting
in
this
nefarious
business
but
said
he
they
are
not
mormons
nor
are
they
fellowshiped
by
them
notwithstanding
all
this
misrepresentation
so
far
succeeded
in
poisoning
the
minds
of
the
public
and
the
leading
men
in
the
state
that
in
january
the
city
charter
of
nauvoo
and
the
charter
of
the
legion
were
both
repealed
and
thus
the
protecting
aegis
of
the
city
government
was
snatched
away
from
her
citizens
when
most
they
needed
it
and
left
them
exposed
to
the
fury
of
their
enemies
of
this
act
of
punic
faith
on
the
part
of
the
state
legislature
the
state
attorney
josiah
lamborn
in
a
letter
to
brigham
young
said
i
have
always
considered
that
your
enemies
have
been
prompted
by
political
and
religious
prejudices
and
by
a
desire
for
plunder
and
blood
more
than
for
the
common
good
by
the
repeal
of
your
charter
and
by
refusing
all
amendments
and
modifications
our
legislature
has
given
a
kind
of
sanction
to
the
barbarous
manner
in
which
you
have
been
treated
your
two
representatives
exerted
themselves
to
the
extent
of
their
ability
in
your
behalf
but
the
tide
of
popular
passion
and
frenzy
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
it
is
truly
a
melancholy
spectacle
to
witness
the
of
a
sovereign
state
condescending
to
pander
to
the
vices
ignorance
and
malevolence
of
a
class
of
people
who
are
at
all
times
ready
for
riot
murder
and
rebellion
senator
jacob
davis
was
one
among
those
who
had
been
indicated
for
the
murder
of
joseph
and
hyrum
and
of
him
the
said
your
senator
jacob
davis
has
done
much
to
poison
the
minds
of
members
against
anything
in
your
favor
he
walks
at
large
in
defiance
of
law
an
indicated
murderer
if
a
mormon
was
in
his
position
the
senate
would
afford
no
protection
but
he
would
be
dragged
forth
to
jail
or
the
gallows
or
be
shot
down
by
a
cowardly
and
brutal
mob
in
the
meantime
the
twelve
apostles
sustained
by
the
saints
put
forth
every
exertion
to
carry
out
the
designs
of
their
martyred
prophet
respecting
nauvoo
the
nauvoo
house
was
hurried
on
and
the
walls
were
growing
rapidly
under
the
constant
labor
of
the
masons
work
too
was
vigorously
prosecuted
at
the
temple
at
the
time
of
joseph
death
that
edifice
was
but
one
story
high
yet
on
the
of
may
about
six
in
the
morning
the
was
laid
amid
the
general
rejoicing
and
shouts
of
hosanna
from
the
assembled
thousands
of
the
saints
as
president
brigham
young
finished
laying
the
he
stood
upon
it
and
said
the
last
stone
is
laid
upon
the
temple
and
i
pray
the
almighty
in
the
name
of
jesus
to
defend
us
in
this
place
and
sustain
us
until
the
temple
is
finished
and
we
have
all
got
our
endowments
the
whole
congregation
then
following
the
motion
of
president
young
shouted
as
loud
as
possible
hosanna
hosanna
hosanna
to
god
and
the
lamb
amen
amen
and
amen
so
let
it
be
thou
almighty
god
solemnly
concluded
president
young
thus
the
world
began
to
understand
that
mormonism
was
not
born
to
die
with
its
earthly
leaders
and
it
began
to
be
whispered
that
the
prophet
joseph
dead
was
even
more
potent
than
when
living
his
testimony
had
been
sealed
with
his
blood
and
it
gave
to
his
life
and
his
labors
an
additional
sanctity
in
the
eyes
of
his
followers
as
well
as
making
it
more
binding
upon
the
world
seeing
then
the
continued
prosperity
of
nauvoo
and
her
citizens
the
people
in
the
vicinity
of
that
city
and
in
the
surrounding
counties
again
commenced
hostilities
if
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
they
had
ever
ceased
the
enormity
of
the
murder
at
carthage
jail
had
checked
them
temporarily
for
an
instant
the
torch
and
assassin
knife
had
dropped
from
their
nerveless
hands
and
they
stood
aghast
at
that
deed
of
blood
but
seeing
the
work
the
murdered
prophet
had
started
surviving
his
fall
they
took
up
again
the
weapons
of
fell
destruction
and
rushed
once
more
upon
their
victims
early
in
september
mobbing
the
scattered
families
of
the
saints
began
in
earnest
a
meeting
was
held
by
near
what
was
called
the
morley
settlement
to
devise
means
of
getting
rid
of
the
mormons
during
the
meeting
guns
were
fired
at
the
house
where
it
was
held
and
the
assault
charged
upon
the
saints
though
most
likely
it
was
done
by
some
of
their
own
party
that
they
might
have
an
excuse
for
their
meditated
acts
of
violence
upon
the
people
of
nauvoo
such
was
the
general
belief
at
the
time
and
governor
ford
in
his
history
of
illinois
speaking
of
this
circumstance
says
in
the
fall
of
the
of
lima
and
green
plains
held
a
meeting
to
devise
means
for
the
expulsion
of
the
mormons
from
their
neighborhood
they
appointed
some
persons
of
their
own
number
to
fire
a
few
shots
at
the
house
where
they
were
assembled
but
to
do
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
hurt
none
who
attended
the
meeting
the
meeting
was
held
the
house
was
fired
at
but
so
as
to
hurt
no
one
and
the
suddenly
breaking
up
their
meeting
rode
all
over
the
country
spreading
the
dire
alarm
that
the
mormons
had
commenced
the
work
of
massacre
and
death
the
attack
was
made
upon
the
morley
settlement
and
on
the
eleventh
of
the
month
houses
were
burned
down
while
their
occupants
were
driven
into
the
bushes
where
men
women
and
children
laid
drenched
with
rain
anxiously
awaiting
the
breaking
of
day
speaking
of
this
outrage
the
editor
of
the
quincy
bartlett
said
seriously
these
outrages
should
be
put
a
stop
to
at
once
if
the
mormons
have
been
guilty
of
crime
why
punish
them
but
do
not
visit
their
sins
upon
defenseless
women
and
children
this
is
as
bad
as
the
savages
it
is
feared
that
this
rising
against
the
mormons
is
not
confined
to
the
morley
settlement
but
that
there
is
an
understanding
among
the
antis
in
the
northern
part
of
this
adams
and
hancock
counties
to
make
a
general
sweep
burning
and
destroying
the
property
of
the
mormons
wherever
it
can
be
found
if
this
is
the
case
there
will
be
employment
of
the
executive
of
the
state
and
that
soon
still
later
news
from
above
referring
to
hancock
county
was
received
late
on
monday
night
the
outrages
were
still
continued
the
flouring
mill
carding
machine
of
norman
buel
a
mormon
one
mile
and
a
half
west
of
lima
is
now
a
heap
of
ashes
colonel
levi
williams
of
green
plains
has
ordered
out
his
brigade
it
is
said
to
aid
the
the
from
shuyler
county
and
the
adjoining
counties
are
flocking
in
and
great
distress
of
life
and
property
may
be
expected
heaven
only
knows
where
these
proceedings
will
end
it
is
time
the
strong
arm
of
power
was
extended
to
quell
them
in
the
midst
of
the
exciting
scenes
which
followed
the
sheriff
of
hancock
county
j
backenstos
proved
himself
a
friend
to
law
and
order
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
arrest
the
spread
of
violence
and
called
upon
all
citizens
to
act
as
a
but
announced
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
had
better
take
no
part
in
suppressing
the
since
that
might
lead
to
a
civil
war
at
the
same
time
he
told
the
people
of
hancock
that
the
mormon
community
had
acted
with
more
than
ordinary
forbearance
remaining
perfectly
quiet
and
offering
no
resistance
when
their
dwellings
their
buildings
stacks
of
grain
were
set
on
fire
in
their
presence
they
had
forborne
until
forbearance
was
no
longer
a
virtue
his
vigorous
efforts
were
making
headway
against
the
violators
of
the
law
but
in
consequence
of
some
parties
who
had
sought
his
life
while
acting
in
his
official
capacity
being
killed
he
was
arrested
by
general
john
hardin
and
placed
on
trial
for
murder
after
which
went
unchecked
of
justice
in
the
midst
of
these
tumultuous
scenes
a
mass
meeting
of
the
citizens
was
convened
at
quincy
on
the
of
september
it
was
generally
known
that
the
prophet
joseph
had
contemplated
going
west
with
the
main
body
of
the
church
and
it
was
one
of
the
objects
of
this
meeting
to
appoint
a
committee
to
confer
with
the
church
authorities
and
learn
what
their
present
intentions
were
as
to
leaving
the
state
it
was
expressed
as
the
opinion
of
that
meeting
that
the
only
basis
upon
which
the
mormon
troubles
could
be
settled
would
be
the
removal
of
that
people
from
illinois
it
is
a
settled
thing
said
bartlett
editor
of
the
quincy
in
his
issue
following
the
meeting
of
the
above
date
it
is
a
settled
thing
that
the
public
sentiment
of
the
state
is
against
the
mormons
and
it
will
be
in
vain
for
them
to
contend
against
it
and
to
prevent
bloodshed
and
the
sacrifice
of
many
lives
on
both
sides
it
is
their
duty
to
obey
the
public
will
and
leave
the
state
as
speedily
as
possible
that
they
will
do
this
we
have
a
confident
hope
and
that
too
before
the
last
extreme
is
resorted
to
that
of
force
we
are
sorry
to
say
that
many
of
the
leading
men
of
quincy
principally
prominent
members
of
the
bar
who
before
had
been
kindly
disposed
towards
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
now
turned
against
them
and
became
the
advocates
of
violence
and
lent
the
weight
and
influence
of
their
characters
to
the
support
and
spread
of
among
such
we
are
sorry
to
publish
major
warren
and
browning
the
latter
having
defended
the
prophet
joseph
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
unjustly
charged
with
crime
before
the
courts
of
the
country
his
burning
words
of
eloquence
in
reciting
the
wrongs
of
the
saints
when
cruelly
expelled
from
missouri
would
one
would
think
have
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
adamantine
hearts
and
now
to
see
him
leagued
with
those
bent
upon
bringing
about
a
repetition
of
these
sorrows
is
an
event
to
be
truly
deplored
in
answer
to
the
quincy
committee
to
state
what
their
present
intentions
were
relative
to
leaving
the
state
the
twelve
handed
them
the
following
communication
nauvoo
september
a
council
of
the
authorities
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
at
nauvoo
have
this
day
received
a
communication
from
henry
asbury
john
robins
albert
pearson
goodwin
ralston
rogers
and
congers
committee
of
the
citizens
of
quincy
requesting
us
to
communicate
in
writing
our
disposition
and
intention
at
this
time
particularly
with
regard
to
removing
to
some
place
where
the
peculiar
organization
of
our
church
will
not
be
likely
to
engender
so
much
strife
and
contention
as
unhappily
exists
at
this
time
in
hancock
and
some
of
the
adjoining
counties
said
committee
have
reported
to
us
the
doings
of
a
public
meeting
of
the
citizens
of
quincy
on
the
by
which
it
appears
there
are
some
feelings
concerning
us
as
a
people
and
in
relation
to
which
sundry
resolutions
were
passed
purporting
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
or
restoring
peace
to
the
country
it
is
our
desire
and
ever
has
been
to
live
in
peace
with
all
men
so
far
as
we
can
without
sacrificing
the
right
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
our
own
consciences
which
privilege
is
granted
by
the
constitution
of
these
united
states
and
whereas
we
have
time
and
again
been
driven
from
our
peaceful
homes
and
our
women
and
children
have
been
obliged
to
live
on
the
prairies
in
the
forests
on
the
roads
and
in
tents
in
the
dead
of
winter
suffering
all
manner
of
hardships
even
to
death
itself
as
the
people
of
quincy
well
know
the
remembrance
of
whose
hospitality
in
former
days
still
causes
our
hearts
to
burn
with
joy
and
raise
the
prayer
to
heaven
for
blessing
on
their
heads
and
whereas
it
is
now
so
late
in
the
season
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
as
a
people
to
remove
this
fall
without
causing
a
repetition
of
like
sufferings
and
whereas
it
has
been
represented
to
us
from
other
sources
than
those
named
and
even
in
some
communications
from
the
executive
of
the
state
that
many
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
were
unfriendly
to
our
views
and
principles
and
whereas
many
scores
of
our
homes
in
this
country
have
been
burned
to
ashes
without
any
justifiable
cause
or
provocation
and
we
have
made
no
resistance
till
compelled
by
the
authorities
of
the
county
so
to
do
and
that
authority
not
connected
with
our
church
and
whereas
said
resistance
to
mobocracy
from
legally
constituted
authority
appears
to
be
misunderstood
by
some
and
misconstrued
by
others
so
as
to
produce
an
undue
excitement
in
the
public
mind
and
whereas
we
desire
peace
above
all
earthly
blessings
we
would
say
to
the
committee
above
mentioned
and
to
the
governor
and
all
the
authorities
and
people
of
illinois
and
the
surrounding
states
and
territories
that
we
propose
to
leave
this
county
next
spring
for
some
point
so
remote
that
there
will
not
need
be
any
difficulty
with
the
people
and
ourselves
provided
certain
propositions
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
our
removal
shall
be
observed
as
follows
that
the
citizens
of
this
and
surrounding
counties
and
all
men
will
use
their
influence
and
exertion
to
help
us
to
sell
or
rent
our
properties
so
as
to
get
means
enough
that
we
can
help
the
widow
the
fatherless
and
the
destitute
to
remove
with
us
that
all
men
will
let
us
alone
with
their
vexatious
so
that
we
may
have
time
for
we
have
broken
no
laws
and
help
us
to
cash
dry
goods
groceries
to
good
oxen
beef
cattle
sheep
wagons
mules
horses
harness
in
exchange
for
our
property
at
a
fair
price
and
deeds
given
on
payment
that
we
may
have
means
to
accomplish
a
removal
without
the
suffering
of
the
destitute
to
an
extent
beyond
the
endurance
of
human
nature
that
all
exchange
of
property
shall
be
conducted
by
a
committee
or
by
committees
of
both
parties
so
that
all
the
business
may
be
transacted
honorably
and
speedily
that
we
will
use
all
lawful
means
in
connection
with
others
to
preserve
the
public
peace
while
we
tarry
and
shall
expect
decidedly
that
we
be
no
more
molested
with
or
any
other
depredations
to
waste
our
property
and
time
and
hinder
our
business
that
it
is
a
mistaken
idea
that
we
have
proposed
to
leave
in
six
months
for
that
would
be
so
early
in
the
spring
that
grass
may
not
grow
nor
water
run
both
of
which
would
be
necessary
for
our
removal
but
we
propose
to
use
our
influence
to
have
no
more
seed
time
and
harvest
among
our
people
in
this
county
after
gathering
our
present
crops
and
that
all
communications
be
made
to
us
in
writing
by
order
of
the
council
brigham
young
president
richards
clerk
the
quincy
committee
reported
to
the
citizens
of
that
city
the
propositions
of
the
church
authorities
which
were
regarded
as
satisfactory
in
part
but
thought
they
were
not
so
full
or
decisive
as
was
necessary
the
mass
meeting
to
which
they
reported
however
accepted
the
propositions
and
decided
to
recommend
the
people
in
the
surrounding
counties
to
do
the
same
but
said
one
of
the
resolutions
we
accept
it
the
proposition
of
the
church
authorities
as
an
unconditional
proposition
to
remove
we
do
not
intend
to
bring
ourselves
under
any
obligation
to
purchase
their
property
or
furnish
purchasers
for
the
same
but
we
will
in
no
way
hinder
or
obstruct
them
in
their
efforts
to
sell
and
will
expect
them
to
dispose
of
their
property
and
remove
at
the
time
appointed
that
it
is
now
too
late
to
attempt
the
settlement
of
the
difficulties
in
hancock
county
upon
any
other
basis
than
that
of
the
removal
of
the
mormons
from
the
state
that
whilst
we
shall
endeavor
by
all
the
means
in
our
power
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
anything
which
might
operate
against
their
removal
and
afford
the
people
of
nauvoo
any
grounds
of
complaint
we
shall
equally
expect
good
faith
upon
their
part
and
if
they
shall
not
comply
with
their
own
proposition
the
consequence
must
rest
upon
those
who
violate
faith
and
we
now
solemnly
pledge
ourselves
to
be
ready
at
the
appointed
time
to
act
as
the
occasion
may
require
and
that
we
will
immediately
adopt
a
preliminary
military
organization
for
prompt
future
action
if
occasion
should
demand
it
that
in
our
opinion
the
peace
of
hancock
county
can
not
so
far
be
restored
as
to
allow
the
desired
progress
to
be
made
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
removal
of
the
mormons
while
j
backenstos
remains
sheriff
of
said
county
and
that
he
ought
to
resign
said
office
of
the
first
of
these
resolutions
josiah
conyers
the
author
of
a
brief
history
of
the
hancock
mob
says
with
just
indignation
and
sarcasm
the
first
one
in
our
opinion
is
unique
they
accepted
and
recommended
to
the
people
of
the
surrounding
counties
to
accept
an
unconditional
proposition
to
remove
but
understand
mormon
though
we
accept
it
and
recommend
the
surrounding
counties
to
do
so
likewise
reprobate
you
unconditionally
we
do
not
intend
to
bring
ourselves
under
any
obligation
to
purchase
your
property
or
to
furnish
purchasers
but
we
will
be
very
kind
and
obliging
and
will
in
no
way
hinder
or
obstruct
you
in
your
efforts
to
sell
provided
nevertheless
this
shall
not
be
so
construed
as
to
prevent
us
from
running
off
the
purchaser
but
we
expect
this
small
favor
of
you
that
you
must
dispose
of
your
property
and
leave
at
the
appointed
time
this
mass
meeting
closed
its
business
by
arranging
a
plan
for
adopting
a
preliminary
military
organization
for
prompt
future
action
if
occasion
should
demand
on
the
first
and
second
of
october
an
convention
assembled
at
carthage
in
which
nine
counties
those
immediately
surrounding
hancock
were
represented
a
committee
on
evidence
was
appointed
on
which
archibald
williams
one
of
the
saints
bitterest
enemies
was
chairman
it
was
its
business
to
collect
evidence
in
relation
to
the
depredations
of
the
mormons
the
chairman
made
a
report
to
which
were
appended
a
number
of
affidavits
charging
various
crimes
on
the
people
of
nauvoo
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
whole
thing
was
an
affair
and
sustained
by
the
men
who
had
assisted
in
the
murder
of
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
and
it
was
upon
their
evidence
the
convention
acted
the
convention
adopted
the
course
followed
by
the
mass
meeting
at
quincy
that
is
it
agreed
to
accept
the
propositions
of
the
church
authorities
to
remove
in
the
same
spirit
they
were
received
at
quincy
and
proceeded
to
prepare
a
preliminary
military
organization
to
act
with
promptitude
provided
the
saints
did
not
remove
the
convention
also
that
it
is
expected
as
an
indispensable
condition
to
the
pacification
of
the
county
that
the
old
citizens
be
permitted
to
return
to
their
homes
unmolested
by
the
present
sheriff
backenstos
and
the
mormons
for
anything
alleged
against
them
any
attempt
on
their
part
to
arrest
or
prosecute
such
persons
for
pretended
offenses
will
inevitably
lead
to
a
renewal
of
the
late
disorder
browning
moved
the
following
that
the
hon
purple
judge
of
this
judicial
circuit
court
be
requested
not
to
hold
a
court
in
hancock
county
this
fall
as
in
the
opinion
of
this
convention
such
court
could
not
be
holden
without
producing
a
collision
between
the
mormons
and
and
renewing
the
excitement
and
disturbances
which
have
recently
affected
said
county
and
thus
those
guilty
of
mob
violence
and
house
burning
were
to
be
protected
by
the
carthage
convention
from
prosecution
before
the
courts
and
those
who
might
have
the
temerity
to
prosecute
them
and
vindicate
the
law
were
threatened
by
a
renewal
of
that
same
lawless
violence
where
then
proud
state
of
illinois
was
your
majesty
your
honor
can
you
answer
if
you
out
of
very
shame
can
not
look
up
and
reply
history
answers
for
you
and
tells
you
it
was
trailed
in
the
dust
under
the
very
feet
of
as
vile
a
set
of
traitors
as
ever
brought
shame
to
their
country
and
where
was
your
virtuous
populace
the
true
watch
and
guard
of
a
state
honor
alas
they
were
blinded
by
the
falsehoods
prompted
by
malice
and
envy
and
started
on
foot
to
shield
the
guilty
murderers
of
innocence
or
quelled
by
the
bold
front
of
a
traitorous
but
successful
mob
in
the
meantime
every
exertion
was
made
by
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
to
be
ready
for
the
great
exodus
in
the
spring
the
temple
had
been
so
far
completed
that
a
conference
was
held
in
it
on
the
sixth
of
october
and
committees
appointed
to
negotiate
the
sale
of
property
and
attend
to
other
branches
of
business
nauvoo
presented
a
busy
scene
in
those
days
men
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
collecting
wagons
and
putting
them
in
repair
the
roar
of
the
smith
forge
was
well
nigh
perpetual
and
even
the
stillness
of
night
was
broken
by
the
steady
beating
of
the
sledge
and
the
merry
ringing
of
the
anvil
committees
were
seeking
purchasers
of
real
estate
and
converting
both
that
and
personal
property
into
anything
that
would
be
of
service
to
those
just
about
to
plunge
into
an
unknown
and
boundless
wilderness
but
while
these
efforts
were
being
put
forth
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
to
fulfill
their
agreement
with
the
mob
forces
the
conditions
of
removal
on
the
part
of
the
old
settlers
were
frequently
violated
and
instances
of
mob
violence
were
almost
every
day
occurrences
the
people
who
were
making
preparations
to
leave
the
farms
gardens
and
homes
they
had
redeemed
from
the
wilderness
were
constantly
threatened
with
destruction
by
the
hostile
demonstrations
of
their
heartless
neighbors
to
give
an
earnest
of
the
intentions
of
the
mormons
to
leave
the
state
where
they
had
suffered
so
much
and
to
thereby
remove
all
occasion
for
the
implacable
wrath
of
their
enemies
that
was
so
impatient
that
it
could
not
wait
for
the
springtime
to
come
for
the
sacrifice
of
its
victims
the
twelve
and
the
high
council
with
about
four
hundred
families
crossed
the
mississippi
on
the
ice
on
the
eleventh
of
february
and
were
soon
lost
to
view
in
the
wilderness
of
iowa
others
continued
to
follow
as
fast
as
they
could
make
ready
until
by
the
latter
part
of
april
the
great
body
of
the
church
at
nauvoo
had
gone
but
now
purchasers
for
their
property
failed
those
who
remained
the
people
surrounding
nauvoo
saw
no
need
of
purchasing
that
which
inevitably
must
become
theirs
the
result
was
that
it
became
impossible
for
this
remnant
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
the
destitute
the
aged
infirm
and
sick
to
remove
and
surely
a
people
who
had
still
any
faith
left
in
humanity
would
be
justified
in
the
belief
that
these
could
remain
until
an
asylum
was
found
for
them
by
their
friends
who
had
already
gone
in
search
of
new
homes
but
in
this
be
it
said
to
the
shame
of
illinois
they
were
deceived
in
the
hardened
hearts
of
their
enemies
however
there
was
no
mercy
even
for
the
helpless
no
pity
for
the
sick
or
destitute
in
their
enemies
veins
the
milk
of
human
kindness
had
dried
up
during
the
preparations
for
the
exodus
major
warren
had
been
stationed
with
a
small
military
force
in
hancock
to
keep
the
peace
but
about
the
middle
of
april
he
received
orders
to
disband
his
force
on
the
first
of
may
as
that
was
adjudged
by
the
public
expectation
to
use
a
phrase
of
major
warren
when
the
last
of
the
mormons
should
have
left
the
state
so
soon
as
it
was
understood
that
there
were
still
left
in
nauvoo
a
number
of
mormons
who
would
likely
remain
through
the
summer
to
continue
their
efforts
to
dispose
of
property
an
uproar
was
raised
in
the
surrounding
counties
meetings
were
held
and
resolutions
adopted
demanding
that
they
leave
at
once
under
threats
of
extermination
when
the
governor
saw
this
new
furore
breaking
out
he
countermanded
the
order
for
major
warren
to
disband
his
forces
and
commanded
him
to
hold
his
position
and
to
preserve
the
peace
until
he
received
further
orders
the
new
impetus
given
to
mob
violence
however
was
not
to
spend
its
force
without
perpetrating
some
outrage
and
a
number
of
cowardly
attacks
were
made
upon
mormons
on
the
eleventh
of
may
major
warren
found
it
necessary
to
issue
a
circular
from
which
i
quote
the
following
the
undersigned
again
deems
it
his
duty
to
appear
before
you
in
a
circular
it
may
not
be
known
to
all
of
you
that
the
day
after
my
detachment
was
disbanded
at
carthage
i
received
orders
from
the
executive
to
muster
them
into
service
again
and
remain
in
the
county
until
further
orders
i
have
now
been
in
nauvoo
with
my
detachment
a
week
and
can
say
to
you
with
perfect
assurance
that
the
demonstrations
made
by
the
mormon
population
are
unequivocal
they
are
leaving
the
state
and
preparing
to
leave
with
every
means
that
god
and
nature
has
placed
in
their
hands
the
desire
the
removal
of
the
mormons
this
is
being
effected
peaceably
and
with
all
possible
dispatch
all
aggressive
movements
therefore
against
them
at
this
time
must
be
actuated
by
a
wanton
desire
to
shed
blood
or
to
plunder
a
man
of
near
sixty
years
of
age
living
about
seven
miles
from
this
place
was
taken
from
his
house
a
few
nights
since
stripped
of
his
clothing
and
his
back
cut
to
pieces
with
a
whip
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
was
a
mormon
and
too
old
to
make
successful
resistance
conduct
of
this
kind
would
disgrace
a
horde
of
savages
to
the
mormons
i
would
say
go
on
with
your
preparations
and
leave
as
fast
as
you
can
leave
the
fighting
to
be
done
by
my
detachment
if
we
are
overpowered
then
recross
the
river
and
defend
yourselves
and
property
to
those
busy
trying
to
raise
mob
forces
principally
squire
and
colonel
levi
williams
major
warren
gave
warning
that
a
previous
order
to
the
effect
that
not
more
than
four
armed
men
other
than
state
troops
should
assemble
together
would
be
enforced
and
that
any
mob
which
assembled
would
be
dispersed
his
force
or
the
mob
would
leave
the
field
in
double
quick
time
this
had
the
effect
of
quieting
matters
down
for
a
season
but
only
until
major
warren
detachment
was
disbanded
a
meeting
was
held
at
carthage
on
the
sixth
of
june
to
make
preparations
for
celebrating
the
fourth
of
july
the
nation
natal
day
it
was
suggested
at
that
meeting
that
as
all
the
mormons
had
not
left
the
state
the
people
of
hancock
county
could
not
be
considered
free
and
under
those
circumstances
they
ought
not
to
celebrate
the
fourth
with
the
usual
rejoicings
the
meeting
was
therefore
adjourned
to
meet
on
the
twelfth
for
the
purpose
of
taking
into
consideration
why
it
was
that
all
mormons
had
not
left
the
city
of
nauvoo
that
happened
to
be
the
day
fixed
by
the
governor
on
which
to
raise
volunteers
for
the
mexican
war
which
in
the
meantime
had
broken
out
so
that
there
was
considerable
excitement
among
the
militia
of
hancock
county
and
the
mob
leaders
doubtless
thought
the
time
propitious
for
making
a
demonstration
against
the
few
saints
still
remaining
in
nauvoo
a
large
body
of
men
were
found
willing
to
march
into
nauvoo
but
it
was
learned
that
the
new
citizens
who
had
purchased
much
of
the
property
of
the
now
exiled
people
were
unwilling
to
allow
the
mob
forces
to
enter
the
city
and
meeting
with
this
unexpected
opposition
the
mob
forces
marched
to
golden
point
distant
from
nauvoo
some
five
or
six
miles
down
the
river
at
this
juncture
stephen
markham
returned
to
nauvoo
from
the
camp
of
the
apostles
for
some
church
property
but
it
was
rumored
that
he
had
returned
with
a
large
body
of
men
and
as
name
was
a
terror
among
the
enemies
of
the
saints
the
mob
took
to
flight
though
no
one
was
in
pursuit
it
was
a
case
of
the
wicked
fleeing
when
no
man
pursued
the
committee
at
quincy
having
control
of
the
mob
forces
either
chagrined
by
the
cowardice
of
those
who
had
collected
at
point
or
appalled
at
the
prospect
of
innocent
blood
being
found
upon
their
skirts
retired
from
the
position
which
had
been
assigned
them
this
disorganized
the
mob
and
they
dispersed
to
their
homes
but
agreed
to
assemble
again
at
the
call
of
their
leaders
and
laid
an
injunction
upon
the
mormons
in
nauvoo
not
to
go
outside
of
the
city
limits
except
in
making
their
way
westward
this
order
of
the
mob
was
disregarded
by
a
party
of
new
citizens
and
a
few
saints
who
went
into
the
country
several
miles
to
harvest
a
field
of
grain
while
engaged
in
their
work
they
were
surrounded
by
a
mob
and
captured
they
were
robbed
of
their
arms
stripped
of
their
clothing
and
cruelly
beaten
with
hickory
goads
this
outrage
created
intense
excitement
in
nauvoo
and
the
new
citizens
and
saints
made
common
cause
in
bringing
the
perpetrators
of
it
to
justice
but
while
the
parties
accused
of
the
crime
were
under
arrest
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
a
second
party
consisting
of
young
and
his
son
richard
ballantyne
james
standing
and
mr
herring
were
kidnapped
and
held
by
their
tormentors
fourteen
days
during
which
time
they
were
constantly
threatened
with
death
they
finally
escaped
however
and
returned
to
nauvoo
the
parties
accused
of
making
the
assault
on
those
in
the
harvest
field
took
a
change
of
venue
to
quincy
but
whether
they
were
ever
brought
to
trial
or
not
i
can
not
learn
but
think
they
were
not
among
those
arrested
for
attacking
the
party
of
harvesters
was
major
and
in
his
possession
was
found
a
gun
taken
from
the
party
the
gun
was
recognized
by
several
persons
among
whom
was
wm
pickett
and
taken
from
him
the
mobbers
then
and
there
made
out
a
charge
of
stealing
and
got
out
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
pickett
furness
and
clifford
pickett
it
would
seem
had
incurred
the
hatred
of
the
mob
and
they
desired
to
get
him
into
their
power
word
was
brought
to
him
by
a
friend
that
the
warrant
was
merely
a
subterfuge
to
get
him
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
consequently
when
one
john
carlin
a
special
constable
from
carthage
undertook
to
arrest
him
he
asked
if
he
would
guarantee
his
safety
being
answered
in
the
negative
he
resisted
the
officer
and
would
not
be
taken
though
it
is
claimed
that
afterwards
in
company
with
several
friends
he
went
before
the
magistrate
of
green
plains
who
it
was
said
issued
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
but
as
he
had
no
record
of
the
warrant
he
refused
to
put
him
under
arrest
the
other
parties
accused
were
acquitted
on
examination
the
mob
now
however
saw
an
opportunity
to
accomplish
their
full
purpose
of
destroying
the
city
of
nauvoo
an
officer
had
been
resisted
by
a
citizen
and
his
fellow
citizens
approved
his
course
nauvoo
was
in
rebellion
against
the
laws
carlin
issued
a
proclamation
calling
upon
the
citizens
to
come
as
a
to
assist
him
in
executing
the
law
and
to
his
clarion
call
there
was
mounting
in
hot
haste
the
old
mob
forces
were
soon
assembled
at
carthage
and
the
command
given
to
captain
singleton
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
petitioned
the
governor
for
protection
and
he
sent
to
them
major
parker
with
a
force
of
ten
men
from
fulton
county
and
also
authorized
him
to
take
command
of
such
forces
as
might
volunteer
to
defend
the
city
against
any
attacks
that
might
be
threatened
he
was
also
empowered
to
pursue
and
in
aid
of
any
peace
officer
with
a
proper
warrant
arrest
the
rioters
who
may
threaten
or
attempt
such
an
attack
and
bring
them
to
trial
and
to
assist
with
an
armed
posse
any
peace
officer
in
making
an
arrest
and
with
a
like
force
to
guard
the
prisoners
during
the
trial
and
as
long
as
he
believed
them
in
danger
of
mob
violence
the
commission
bears
date
august
thus
equipped
major
parker
went
to
nauvoo
and
issued
a
proclamation
calling
upon
the
mobs
then
collecting
the
name
of
the
people
of
illinois
and
by
virtue
of
the
authority
vested
in
him
by
the
governor
of
the
state
to
the
issue
then
was
no
longer
between
the
mob
forces
and
the
mormons
it
was
between
the
recognized
authority
of
the
state
and
this
lawless
banditti
major
parker
also
announced
that
he
was
authorized
and
prepared
to
assist
the
proper
officers
in
serving
any
writs
in
their
hands
in
answer
to
this
proclamation
carlin
issued
a
counter
one
to
the
effect
that
if
he
met
with
resistance
from
parker
he
would
consider
his
detachment
as
a
mob
and
proceed
accordingly
to
which
parker
replied
if
the
forces
under
carlin
undertook
to
enter
nauvoo
he
would
treat
them
as
a
mob
parker
also
wrote
to
singleton
and
expressed
a
desire
to
bring
about
a
settlement
of
the
difficulty
without
shedding
blood
to
this
communication
singleton
replied
that
in
proposition
he
saw
nothing
looking
to
the
expulsion
of
the
remnant
of
the
mormon
people
left
in
nauvoo
and
that
is
said
he
a
qua
with
us
it
will
be
remembered
that
carlin
professed
object
in
calling
for
a
posse
was
to
arrest
william
pickett
but
now
something
more
is
demanded
the
immediate
removal
of
the
mormons
the
surrender
of
nauvoo
etc
singleton
concluded
his
terms
to
parker
the
representative
of
the
governor
of
the
state
in
these
words
when
i
say
to
you
the
mormons
must
go
i
speak
the
mind
of
the
camp
and
the
country
they
can
leave
without
force
or
injury
to
themselves
or
their
property
but
i
say
to
you
sir
with
all
candor
shall
they
may
fix
the
time
within
sixty
days
or
i
will
fix
it
for
them
at
this
juncture
a
committee
of
one
hundred
which
had
been
appointed
by
the
citizens
of
quincy
arrived
on
the
scene
to
act
ostensibly
as
mediators
to
bring
about
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
trouble
but
one
can
not
help
thinking
their
true
mission
was
to
insidiously
carry
out
the
project
of
the
mob
but
i
leave
the
reader
to
draw
his
own
inference
respecting
that
when
he
hears
the
terms
proposed
by
that
committee
and
which
all
classes
of
citizens
in
nauvoo
seeing
no
alternative
accepted
the
terms
offered
were
that
the
mormons
move
out
of
the
city
or
disperse
within
sixty
days
a
force
of
to
remain
in
the
city
during
that
time
half
the
expense
of
maintaining
them
was
to
be
paid
by
the
people
of
nauvoo
for
which
amount
they
were
to
give
bond
that
the
mormons
surrender
their
arms
which
should
be
returned
to
them
after
they
left
the
state
that
as
soon
as
those
arms
were
surrendered
the
forces
under
singleton
were
to
disperse
that
all
hostilities
cease
between
the
respective
parties
as
soon
as
the
agreement
was
accepted
the
singularity
about
this
agreement
is
that
not
one
word
is
said
about
giving
up
pickett
to
arrest
whom
the
forces
under
singleton
were
ostensibly
called
out
does
it
not
reveal
the
fact
that
the
pickett
episode
was
merely
a
ruse
a
pretext
for
gathering
a
mob
to
sack
nauvoo
and
drive
away
the
mormons
this
proposed
settlement
however
was
rejected
by
the
mob
forces
it
did
not
sufficiently
gratify
their
implacable
hatred
they
did
in
very
deed
as
the
prophet
joseph
foretold
his
people
they
would
thirst
for
the
blood
of
every
man
in
whose
heart
dwelt
a
single
spark
of
the
spirit
of
the
fullness
of
the
gospel
but
when
the
mob
rejected
these
terms
singleton
and
other
leaders
left
them
saying
the
mormons
had
done
all
that
could
be
required
of
them
on
the
retirement
of
singleton
and
others
the
command
of
the
mob
was
given
to
thomas
brockman
a
campbellite
preacher
known
familiarly
as
old
tom
among
his
followers
he
at
once
went
into
active
preparations
for
bombarding
the
city
and
with
a
force
of
more
than
one
thousand
men
and
six
pieces
of
cannon
took
up
a
position
about
one
mile
east
of
the
city
in
a
cornfield
just
at
the
head
of
mulholland
street
and
not
far
from
the
house
of
squire
wells
from
this
position
brockman
issued
the
terms
upon
which
he
would
grant
peace
the
terms
he
offered
were
much
more
outrageous
than
those
proposed
by
the
quincy
committee
and
therefore
were
rejected
by
the
people
of
nauvoo
both
by
mormon
and
brockman
addressed
his
insolent
terms
of
peace
to
the
commanding
officer
of
nauvoo
and
the
trustees
of
the
mormon
church
the
commanding
officer
was
major
clifford
who
had
succeeded
major
parker
in
that
position
he
was
vested
with
the
governor
commission
as
parker
had
been
and
it
was
to
this
representative
of
illinois
executive
that
the
demand
of
brockman
to
surrender
the
city
and
stack
his
arms
was
addressed
so
that
he
and
his
mob
forces
were
pitted
against
the
laws
and
lawful
authority
of
the
state
and
we
shall
see
as
we
proceed
how
mobs
were
more
powerful
than
the
state
authorities
or
rather
how
the
lawful
authorities
of
the
state
were
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
shame
so
recreant
to
the
trust
reposed
in
them
so
neglectful
of
the
honor
and
dignity
of
the
state
that
they
permitted
their
own
representatives
to
be
driven
in
disgrace
from
the
field
by
the
mob
led
by
brockman
and
furthermore
those
same
authorities
were
so
lost
to
every
principle
of
humanity
that
they
permitted
the
helpless
and
unoffending
people
to
be
driven
from
their
homes
out
into
the
wilderness
to
perish
from
exposure
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
were
not
willing
to
allow
brockman
mob
to
enter
the
city
without
making
some
effort
to
prevent
him
and
although
their
forces
numbered
not
more
than
three
or
four
hundred
they
presented
a
determined
front
to
the
mob
they
converted
some
shafts
into
cannon
five
pieces
in
all
and
threw
up
some
fortifications
on
the
north
of
mulholland
street
facing
the
camp
these
works
were
under
command
of
captain
lamareux
on
the
south
of
of
mulholland
street
the
companies
of
gates
and
cutler
were
stationed
on
september
and
there
was
some
desultory
firing
on
both
sides
without
much
advantage
being
gained
on
the
thirteenth
however
the
advanced
in
solid
column
making
a
desperate
effort
to
reach
mulholland
street
the
principal
street
leading
into
nauvoo
from
the
east
if
the
onset
was
desperate
the
resistance
was
equally
determined
the
main
shock
of
the
conflict
was
sustained
for
a
time
by
gates
and
cutler
companies
and
they
must
inevitably
have
been
overpowered
by
the
superior
numbers
of
the
mob
had
not
squire
wells
come
up
with
lamareux
company
to
reinforce
them
the
doughty
squire
had
ridden
across
an
open
field
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
enemy
to
where
lamareux
company
lay
behind
their
fortifications
he
called
upon
them
to
advance
at
once
to
check
the
approach
of
the
mob
there
was
one
brave
spirit
who
needed
no
second
call
to
perform
his
duty
that
was
william
anderson
captain
of
what
was
known
as
the
spartan
band
he
leaped
from
behind
the
trenches
and
calling
on
his
men
to
follow
started
for
the
front
the
rest
of
lamareux
company
did
not
so
readily
respond
and
manifested
a
disposition
to
retreat
rather
than
advance
squire
wells
observing
this
and
seeing
anderson
and
his
few
brave
followers
rushing
headlong
into
the
conflict
raised
in
his
stirrups
and
swinging
his
hat
shouted
hurrah
for
anderson
who
would
follow
the
brave
anderson
this
rallied
their
spirits
and
they
followed
the
squire
to
the
front
where
they
were
soon
firing
at
the
enemy
as
steadily
as
their
comrades
the
mob
forces
by
this
time
had
nearly
reached
mulholland
street
but
now
they
recoiled
from
the
rapid
firing
of
the
reinforcements
and
beat
a
retreat
to
the
house
of
a
carmichael
but
a
short
distance
from
squire
wells
house
here
they
waited
until
wagons
came
from
their
camp
and
putting
their
dead
and
wounded
into
them
returned
to
where
they
were
encamped
in
the
morning
the
number
of
killed
and
wounded
of
the
mob
has
never
been
ascertained
as
the
facts
were
kept
concealed
the
intrepid
anderson
and
his
equally
brave
son
a
lad
not
more
than
fifteen
years
of
age
fell
in
the
engagement
and
one
morris
was
killed
while
crossing
a
field
by
a
cannon
ball
negotiations
were
now
renewed
and
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
seeing
that
the
state
authorities
rendered
them
no
assistance
but
permitted
even
their
own
authority
to
be
braved
by
a
lawless
mob
and
knowing
that
they
would
eventually
be
overpowered
accepted
the
following
terms
of
settlement
in
order
to
stop
the
further
effusion
of
blood
the
city
of
nauvoo
will
surrender
the
force
of
colonel
brockman
to
enter
and
take
possession
of
the
city
tomorrow
the
seventeenth
of
september
at
three
the
arms
to
be
delivered
to
the
quincy
committee
to
be
returned
on
the
crossing
of
the
river
the
quincy
committee
pledge
themselves
to
use
their
influence
for
the
protection
of
persons
and
property
from
all
violence
and
the
officers
of
the
camp
and
the
men
pledge
themselves
to
protect
all
persons
and
property
from
violence
the
sick
and
helpless
to
be
protected
and
treated
with
humanity
the
mormon
population
of
the
city
to
leave
the
state
or
disperse
as
soon
as
they
can
cross
the
river
five
men
including
the
trustees
of
the
church
and
five
clerks
with
their
families
wm
pickett
not
one
of
the
number
to
be
permitted
to
remain
in
the
city
for
the
disposition
of
property
free
from
all
molestation
and
personal
violence
hostilities
to
cease
immediately
and
ten
men
of
the
quincy
committee
to
enter
the
city
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
as
soon
as
they
think
proper
these
terms
of
capitulation
were
signed
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
by
almon
babbitt
joseph
heywood
and
john
fullmer
and
on
the
part
of
the
mob
by
thomas
brockman
and
john
carlin
and
by
andrew
johnson
on
behalf
of
the
quincy
committee
the
rest
of
my
story
is
soon
told
there
was
a
hasty
flight
of
the
mormon
population
and
a
number
of
the
new
citizens
who
had
assisted
in
the
defense
of
nauvoo
they
left
their
homes
without
being
able
to
carry
with
them
anything
for
their
comfort
the
sick
aged
and
infirm
together
with
the
youth
without
regard
to
sex
or
condition
shared
the
same
fate
they
had
to
lie
out
on
the
mississippi
bottoms
where
many
perished
through
exposure
and
beyond
all
doubt
all
would
have
famished
from
hunger
had
not
their
camp
been
filled
with
innumerable
flocks
of
quail
so
tame
that
women
and
children
caught
hundreds
of
them
in
their
hands
and
thus
was
the
cry
of
hunger
relieved
by
what
would
generally
be
regarded
as
a
miraculous
occurrence
brockman
and
his
forces
entered
the
city
and
once
in
he
insolently
violated
every
condition
of
the
treaty
of
surrender
but
lest
i
should
be
charged
with
inaccuracy
for
such
events
as
i
am
recording
seem
almost
too
much
to
believe
i
quote
from
the
report
made
by
brayman
to
governor
ford
brayman
had
acted
as
the
agent
for
some
time
in
a
secret
capacity
from
the
commencement
of
the
difficulties
at
nauvoo
and
the
following
abstract
is
from
an
elaborate
report
he
gives
of
the
final
struggle
for
the
defense
of
the
city
moreover
the
fact
that
i
have
never
seen
this
matter
reproduced
in
any
of
our
books
encourages
me
to
insert
it
here
the
force
of
general
brockman
marched
into
the
city
at
three
from
fifteen
hundred
to
two
thousand
men
marched
in
procession
through
the
city
and
encamped
on
the
south
side
near
the
river
the
march
was
conducted
without
the
least
disorder
or
trespass
upon
persons
or
property
the
streets
were
deserted
the
obnoxious
persons
had
left
the
city
leaving
but
little
to
provoke
the
resentment
of
the
victors
but
a
few
mormons
remained
in
the
city
and
these
were
hastening
their
preparations
for
crossing
the
river
as
soon
as
possible
on
my
return
from
carthage
to
the
city
about
noon
i
learned
that
the
quincy
committee
had
closed
its
labors
at
sunrise
and
had
left
for
home
leaving
a
to
complete
the
reception
and
delivery
of
the
arms
of
those
mormons
who
had
not
yet
departed
i
also
learned
that
in
addition
to
the
duty
general
brockman
had
assumed
under
the
treaty
of
superintending
the
removal
of
the
mormons
from
the
state
he
had
issued
an
order
for
the
expulsion
from
the
state
of
all
who
had
borne
arms
in
defense
of
the
city
against
his
force
and
all
who
were
in
any
manner
identified
with
the
mormons
it
could
scarcely
be
believed
that
such
an
order
in
such
palpable
and
gross
violation
of
the
unanimous
pledge
which
had
been
signed
by
the
officers
agreed
to
by
the
whole
force
and
endorsed
by
the
quincy
committee
had
been
given
but
on
applying
to
general
brockman
i
learned
that
such
an
order
had
been
given
and
would
be
executed
this
order
was
rigorously
enforced
throughout
the
day
with
many
circumstances
of
the
utmost
cruelty
and
injustice
bands
of
armed
men
traversed
the
city
entering
the
houses
of
citizens
robbing
them
of
arms
throwing
their
household
goods
out
of
doors
insulting
them
and
threatening
their
lives
many
were
seized
and
marched
to
the
camp
and
after
military
examination
set
across
the
river
for
the
crime
of
sympathizing
with
the
mormons
or
the
still
more
heinous
offense
of
in
the
defense
of
the
city
under
command
of
officers
commissioned
you
governor
ford
and
instructed
to
make
that
defense
it
is
indeed
painfully
true
that
many
citizens
of
this
state
have
been
driven
from
it
by
an
armed
force
because
impelled
by
our
encouragement
and
a
sense
of
duty
they
have
bravely
defended
their
homes
and
homes
of
their
neighbors
from
the
assaults
of
a
force
assembled
for
unlawful
purposes
in
the
face
of
the
pledge
given
to
protect
persons
and
property
from
all
violence
excepting
of
course
mormon
persons
and
property
it
may
be
estimated
that
nearly
one
half
of
the
new
citizens
of
nauvoo
have
been
forced
from
their
homes
and
dare
not
return
thus
far
these
citizens
have
appealed
in
vain
for
protection
and
redress
it
remains
yet
to
be
seen
whether
there
is
efficacy
in
the
law
power
in
the
executive
arm
or
potency
in
public
opinion
sufficient
to
right
their
grievous
wrongs
it
is
disgraceful
to
the
character
of
the
state
and
a
humiliation
not
to
be
borne
to
permit
a
military
leader
acting
without
a
shadow
of
lawful
authority
but
in
violation
of
law
and
right
not
only
to
thwart
the
will
of
the
executive
but
to
impose
upon
citizens
the
penalty
of
banishment
for
acting
under
it
was
this
arch
traitor
brockman
hung
for
his
treason
against
the
state
no
nor
even
tried
or
questioned
neither
he
nor
his
followers
perhaps
it
was
thought
that
an
investigation
might
reveal
the
fact
to
the
world
that
many
high
officials
and
chief
among
them
the
governor
of
the
state
had
been
engaged
in
an
unlawful
conspiracy
to
drive
from
illinois
an
innocent
community
whose
rights
they
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
defend
against
the
fierce
attacks
of
lawless
mobs
whose
hands
were
crimson
in
the
blood
of
innocence
and
who
repeatedly
trampled
the
honor
and
dignity
of
the
state
under
their
feet
after
a
time
the
most
of
the
new
citizens
returned
to
the
homes
they
had
purchased
for
little
or
nothing
from
the
now
exiled
founders
of
the
beautiful
city
but
nauvoo
never
prospered
under
its
new
masters
out
of
sympathy
for
those
who
had
redeemed
it
from
a
wilderness
and
some
portions
of
it
from
a
swamp
its
fields
and
gardens
refused
to
yield
in
their
strength
to
the
industry
of
other
hands
its
decline
was
as
rapid
and
disastrous
as
its
rise
had
been
sudden
and
glorious
a
french
communistic
society
had
purchased
considerable
property
in
the
deserted
city
and
into
their
hands
passed
the
splendid
temple
the
saints
at
such
sacrifice
had
erected
externally
the
building
had
been
completed
in
the
spring
of
even
to
the
gilding
of
the
angel
and
the
trumpet
at
the
top
of
the
spire
during
the
winter
of
various
rooms
of
the
temple
were
dedicated
for
ordinance
work
and
there
hundreds
of
the
faithful
saints
received
their
endowments
the
sacred
mysteries
of
the
faith
the
main
court
of
worship
was
also
prepared
and
on
the
evening
of
april
the
building
was
privately
dedicated
joseph
young
the
senior
president
of
the
first
council
of
seventy
offering
the
dedicatory
prayer
on
the
first
of
may
under
the
direction
of
apostles
orson
hyde
and
wilford
woodruff
the
edifice
was
publicly
dedicated
according
to
the
order
of
the
holy
priesthood
revealed
through
the
prophet
joseph
smith
the
temple
was
always
a
source
of
envy
to
the
enemies
of
the
saints
and
it
was
feared
that
if
it
continued
to
stand
it
would
be
a
bond
between
its
exiled
builders
and
the
city
from
which
they
had
been
cruelly
driven
and
an
inducement
for
them
to
return
on
the
tenth
of
november
an
incendiary
therefore
set
it
on
fire
and
the
tower
was
destroyed
and
the
whole
building
so
shattered
that
on
the
of
may
a
tornado
blew
down
the
north
wall
i
was
informed
by
morrill
who
at
the
time
of
my
visit
was
mayor
of
nauvoo
and
by
the
way
one
who
had
assisted
in
its
defense
when
attacked
by
the
mob
that
one
joseph
agnew
confessed
to
being
the
incendiary
finally
all
the
walls
were
pulled
down
and
the
stone
hauled
away
for
building
purposes
until
now
not
one
stone
stands
upon
another
even
the
very
foundation
has
been
cleared
away
and
the
excavation
for
the
basement
filled
up
and
the
site
covered
with
inferior
buildings
at
the
time
of
my
visit
in
the
summer
of
the
population
of
nauvoo
numbered
about
seventeen
hundred
of
whom
were
germans
the
principal
occupation
is
vineyards
covering
some
portions
of
the
city
plat
which
was
once
the
principal
business
center
the
whole
place
has
a
appearance
and
seems
to
be
withering
under
a
blight
from
which
it
refuses
to
recover
such
is
the
fate
of
nauvoo
which
once
promised
to
be
the
first
city
of
illinois
and
beyond
all
question
would
have
been
so
had
there
existed
sufficient
virtue
and
honor
in
that
state
to
have
protected
its
founders
in
their
rights
still
stands
the
forest
primeval
but
under
the
shade
of
its
branches
dwells
another
race
with
other
customs
and
languages
the
quotation
connects
me
with
my
introduction
and
reminds
me
that
i
have
completed
the
task
proposed
in
these
pages
but
in
the
fate
which
overtook
the
survivors
of
the
acadian
from
nova
scotia
and
the
mormons
exiles
from
illinois
the
former
fails
altogether
to
suggest
the
faintest
hint
of
a
parallel
only
along
the
shores
of
the
mournful
and
mystic
atlantic
linger
a
few
acadian
peasants
whose
fathers
from
exile
wandered
back
to
their
native
land
to
die
in
its
bosom
finishes
the
story
of
the
acadian
exiles
not
so
the
story
of
the
exiles
from
illinois
they
did
not
perish
in
exile
nor
did
merely
a
handful
of
them
broken
in
spirits
as
in
fortunes
return
to
live
silent
and
sad
on
the
site
of
their
former
homes
the
mormon
exiles
were
not
broken
and
scattered
they
remained
a
people
beyond
their
exile
they
were
destined
to
have
a
glorious
history
their
faith
in
their
religion
was
not
shattered
their
church
was
not
disrupted
their
hearts
were
not
turned
against
their
prophets
their
spirits
were
not
blighted
nor
their
hearts
bowed
down
beyond
the
power
of
recovery
nor
their
fortunes
so
blasted
that
they
could
not
hope
for
prosperity
for
god
was
with
them
the
institution
the
church
brought
into
existence
and
its
doctrines
developed
amid
so
much
of
spiritual
tempest
and
pursued
so
relentlessly
by
mob
violence
and
which
may
be
said
to
have
had
a
second
birth
at
nauvoo
and
to
have
received
sanctification
from
the
martyrdom
of
her
earthly
founder
the
church
which
these
exiles
bore
with
them
into
the
western
wilderness
was
not
born
to
die
whatever
might
be
the
fate
of
the
church
and
the
saints
in
other
dispensations
of
the
gospel
god
had
now
introduced
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
times
in
which
he
has
decreed
that
all
things
in
christ
shall
be
gathered
together
in
one
even
in
him
a
dispensation
in
which
the
salvation

made

glorious
reign
of
truth

so
long
promised
by
god
and
his

hence
the
church
was
not

the
people
who
fled
with
her
to
the
wilderness
did
not
perish
the
blinding
storms
of
sleet
and
rain
which
enveloped

in

trains
they
penetrated

curtain
rung
down

the
most
melancholy
scene
in

history
the
scene
of
a
people
in

america
the
boasted
asylum
for
the
oppressed
where
religious
freedom
is
guaranteed
by
express
constitutional
provision
fleeing
from
the
worst
forms
of
oppression
the
oppression
of
mob
violence
invoked
in

to
crush
their
religious
faith
but
the
curtain
so
rung
down
was
not
upon
the
final
act
the
hand
of
god
again
rolled
it
up
and
when
he
did
it
was
to
reveal
to
the

the
exiles
as
the
redeemers
of
desert
wastes
the
planters
of
cities
the
builders
of
temples
the
founders
of

and
for
themselves
and
for
their
religious
faith
so
entrenched
so
strengthened
so
enlarged

hon
john
calhoun
dear
sir
as
we
understand
you
are
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
at
the
next
election
and
as
the
saints
sometimes
called
mormons
who
now
constitute
a
numerous
class
in
the
school
politic
of
this
vast
republic
have
been
robbed
of
an
immense
amount
of
property
and
endured
nameless
sufferings
by
the
state
of
missouri
and
from
her
borders
have
been
driven
by
force
of
arms
contrary
to
our
national
covenants
and
as
in
vain
we
have
sought
redress
by
all
constitutional
legal
and
honorable
means
in
her
courts
her
executive
councils
and
her
legislative
halls
and
as
we
have
petitioned
congress
to
take
cognizance
of
our
sufferings
without
effect
we
have
judged
it
wisdom
to
address
you
this
communication
and
solicit
an
immediate
specific
and
candid
reply
to
will
be
your
rule
of
action
relative
to
us
as
a
should
fortune
favor
your
ascension
to
the
chief
magistracy
most
respectfully
sir
your
friend
and
the
friend
of
peace
good
order
and
constitutional
rights
joseph
smith
in
behalf
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ

fort
hill
december
sir
you
ask
me
what
would
be
my
rule
of
action
relative
to
the
mormons
or
saints
should
i
be
elected
president
to
which
i
answer
that
if
i
should
be
elected
i
would
strive
to
administer
the
government
according
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
union
and
that
as
they
make
no
distinction
between
citizens
of
different
religious
creeds
i
should
make
none
as
far
as
it
depends
on
the
executive
department
all
should
have
the
full
benefit
of
both
and
none
should
be
exempt
from
their
operation
but
as
you
refer
to
the
case
of
missouri
candor
compels
me
to
repeat
what
i
said
to
you
at
washington
that
according
to
my
views
the
case
does
not
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
which
is
one
of
limited
and
specific
powers
with
respect
i
am
calhoun
joseph

january
sir
your
reply
to
my
letter
of
last
november
concerning
your
rule
of
action
towards
the
saints
if
elected
president
is
at
hand
and
that
you
and
your
friends
of
the
same
opinion
relative
to
the
matter
in
question
may
not
be
disappointed
as
to
me
or
my
mind
upon
so
grave
a
subject
permit
me
as
a
man
as
a
to
the
perpetuity
of
constitutional
rights
and
liberty
and
as
a
friend
to
the
free
worship
of
almighty
god
by
all
according
to
the
dictates
of
every
person
own
conscience
to
say
am
that
a
man
or
men
in
the
highest
stations
of
public
life
should
have
made
up
such
a
fragile
view
of
a
case
than
which
there
is
not
one
on
the
face
of
the
globe
fraught
with
so
much
consequence
to
the
happiness
of
men
in
this
world
or
the
world
to
come
to
be
sure
the
first
paragraph
of
your
letter
appears
very
complacent
and
fair
on
a
white
sheet
of
paper
and
who
that
is
ambitious
for
greatness
and
power
would
not
have
said
the
same
thing
your
oath
would
bind
you
to
support
the
constitution
and
laws
and
as
all
creeds
and
religions
are
alike
tolerated
they
must
of
course
all
be
justified
or
condemned
according
to
merit
or
demerit
but
why
tell
me
why
are
all
the
principal
men
held
up
for
public
stations
cautiously
not
to
publish
to
the
world
that
they
judge
a
righteous
law
or
no
law
for
laws
and
opinions
like
the
vanes
of
steeples
change
with
the
wind
one
congress
passes
a
law
another
repeals
it
and
one
statesman
says
that
the
constitution
means
this
and
another
that
and
who
does
not
know
that
all
may
be
wrong
the
opinion
and
pledge
therefore
in
the
first
paragraph
of
your
reply
to
my
question
like
the
forced
steam
from
the
engine
of
a
makes
the
show
of
a
bright
cloud
at
first
but
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
a
purer
atmosphere
dissolves
to
common
air
again
your
second
paragraph
leaves
you
naked
before
yourself
like
a
likeness
in
a
mirror
when
you
say
that
according
to
your
view
the
federal
government
is
one
of
limited
and
specific
powers
and
has
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
the
mormons
so
then
a
state
can
at
any
time
expel
any
portion
of
her
citizens
with
impunity
and
in
the
language
of
van
buren
frosted
over
with
your
gracious
of
the
though
the
cause
is
ever
so
just
government
can
do
nothing
for
them
because
it
has
no
power
go
on
then
missouri
after
another
set
of
inhabitants
as
the
saints
did
have
entered
some
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
land
and
made
extensive
improvements
thereon
go
on
then
i
say
banish
the
occupants
or
owners
or
kill
them
as
the
mobbers
did
many
of
the
saints
and
take
their
land
and
property
as
spoil
and
let
the
legislature
as
in
the
case
of
the
mormons
appropriate
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
pay
the
mob
for
doing
that
job
for
the
renowned
senator
from
south
carolina
calhoun
says
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
are
so
and
limited
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
of
the
case
o
ye
people
who
groan
under
the
oppression
of
tyrants
ye
exiled
poles
who
have
felt
the
iron
hand
of
russian
grasp
ye
poor
and
unfortunate
among
all
nations
come
to
the
asylum
of
the
oppressed
buy
ye
lands
of
the
general
government
pay
in
your
money
to
the
treasury
to
strengthen
the
army
and
the
navy

according
to
the
dictates
of
your
own
consciences
pay
in
your
taxes
to
support
the
great
heads
of
a
glorious
nation
but
remember
a
is
so
much
more
powerful
than
the
united
states
the
parent
government
that
it
can
exile
you
at
pleasure
mob
you
with
impunity
confiscate
your
lands
and
property
have
the
legislature
sanction
it
yea
even
murder
you
as
an
edict
of
an
emperor
it
does
no
for
the
noble
senator
of
south
carolina
says
the
power
of
the
federal
government
is
limited
and
specific
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
of
the
case
what
think
ye
of

of

blessed
of
all
ages
hark
ye
shades
of
departed
statesmen
listen
abraham
moses
homer
socrates
solon
solomon
and
all
that
ever
thought
of
right
and
wrong
look
down
from
your
exaltations
if
you
have
any
for
it
is
said
in
the
midst
of
counsellors
there
safety
and
when
you
have
learned
that
fifteen
thousand
innocent
citizens
after
having
purchased
their
lands
of
the
united
states
and
paid
for
them
were
expelled
from
a
sovereign
state
by
order
of
the
governor
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
their
arms
taken
from
them
by
the
same
authority
and
their
right
of
migration
into
said
state
denied
under
pain
of
imprisonment
whipping
robbing
mobbing
and
even
death
and
no
justice
or
recompense
allowed
and
from
the
legislature
with
the
governor
at
the
head
down
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
with
a
bottle
of
whisky
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
hear
them
all
declare
that
there
is
no
justice
for
a
mormon
in
that
state
and
judge
ye
a
righteous
judgment
and
tell
me
when
the
virtue
of
the
states
was
stolen
where
the
honor
of
the
general
government
lies
hid
and
what
clothes
a
senator
with
wisdom
o
nullifying
carolina
o
little
tempestuous
rhode
island
would
it
not
be
well
for
the
great
men
of
the
nation
to
read
the
fable
of
the
judge
and
when
part
of
the
free
citizens
of
a
state
had
been
expelled
contrary
to
the
constitution
mobbed
robbed
plundered
and
many
murdered
instead
of
searching
into
the
course
taken
with
joanna
southcott
ann
lee
the
french
prophets
the
quakers
of
new
england
and
rebellious
niggers
in
the
slave
states
to
hear
both
sides
and
then
judge
rather
than
have
the
mortification
to
say
oh
it
is
bull
that
has
killed
ox
that
alters
the
case
i
must
inquire
into
it
if
and
if
the
general
government
has
no
power
to
reinstate
expelled
citizens
to
their
rights
there
is
a
monstrous
hypocrite
fed
and
fostered
from
the
hard
earnings
of
the
people
a
real
bull
beggar
upheld
by
sycophants
and
although
you
may
wink
to
the
priests
to
stigmatize
wheedle
the
drunkards
to
swear
and
raise
the
of
impostor
false
prophet
g
d
old
joe
smith
yet
remember
if
the
saints
are
not
restored
to
all
their
rights
and
paid
for
all
their
losses
according
to
the
known
rules
of
justice
and
judgment
reciprocation
and
common
honesty
among
men
that
god
will
come
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
vex
this
nation
with
a
sore
vexation
yea
the
consuming
wrath
of
an
offended
god
shall
smoke
through
the
nation
with
as
much
distress
and
woe
as
independence
has
blazed
through
with
pleasure
and
delight
where
is
the
strength
of
government
where
is
the
patriotism
of
a
washington
a
warren
and
adams
and
where
is
a
spark
from
the
of
by
which
one
candle
might
be
lit
that
would
glimmer
upon
the
confines
of
democracy
well
may
it
be
said
that
one
man
is
not
a
state
nor
one
state
the
nation
in
the
days
of
general
jackson
when
france
refused
the
first
installment
for
spoliations
there
was
power
force
and
honor
enough
to
resent
injustice
and
insult
and
the
money
came
and
shall
missouri
filled
with
and
white
men
stealers
go
unwhipped
of
justice
for
tenfold
greater
sins
than
france
no
verily
no
while
i
have
power
of
body
and
mind
while
water
runs
and
grass
grows
while
virtue
is
lovely
and
vice
hateful
and
while
a
stone
points
out
a
sacred
spot
where
a
fragment
of
american
liberty
once
was
i
or
my
posterity
will
plead
the
cause
of
injured
innocence
until
missouri
makes
atonement
for
all
her
sins
or
sinks
disgraced
degraded
and
damned
to
hell
where
the
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
why
sir
the
power
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
and
the
states
belong
to
the
people
and
congress
sent
to
do
the
business
have
all
power
and
shall
fifteen
thousand
citizens
groan
in
exile
o
vain
men
will
ye
not
if
ye
do
not
restore
them
to
their
rights
and
two
million
dollars
worth
of
property
relinquish
to
them
the
saints
as
a
body
their
portion
of
power
that
belongs
to
them
according
to
the
constitution
power
has
its
convenience
as
well
as
inconvenience
the
world
was
not
made
for
caesar
alone
but
for
titus
too
i
will
give
you
a
parable
a
certain
lord
had
a
vineyard
in
a
goodly
land
which
men
labored
in
at
their
pleasure
a
few
meek
men
also
went
and
purchased
with
money
from
some
of
these
chief
men
that
labored
at
pleasure
a
portion
of
land
in
the
vineyard
at
a
very
remote
part
of
it
and
began
to
improve
it
and
to
eat
and
drink
the
fruit
thereof
when
some
vile
persons
who
regarded
not
man
neither
feared
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
rose
up
suddenly
and
robbed
these
meek
men
and
drove
them
from
their
possessions
killing
many
this
barbarous
act
made
no
small
stir
among
the
men
in
the
vineyard
and
all
that
portion
who
were
attached
to
that
part
of
the
vineyard
where
the
men
were
robbed
rose
up
in
grand
council
with
their
chief
man
who
had
firstly
ordered
the
deed
to
be
done
and
made
a
covenant
not
to
pay
for
the
cruel
deed
but
to
keep
the
spoil
and
never
let
those
meek
men
set
their
feet
on
that
soil
again
neither
recompense
them
for
it
now
these
meek
men
in
their
distress
wisely
sought
redress
of
those
wicked
men
in
every
possible
manner
and
got
none
they
then
supplicated
the
chief
men
who
held
the
vineyard
at
pleasure
and
who
had
the
power
to
sell
and
defend
it
for
redress
and
redemption
and
those
men
loving
the
fame
and
favor
of
the
multitude
more
than
the
glory
of
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
answered
your
cause
is
just
but
we
can
do
nothing
for
you
because
we
have
no
power
now
when
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saw
that
virtue
innocence
was
not
regarded
and
his
vineyard
occupied
by
wicked
men
he
sent
men
and
took
the
possession
of
it
to
himself
and
destroyed
these
unfaithful
servants
and
appointed
them
their
portion
among
hypocrites
and
let
me
say
that
all
men
who
say
that
congress
has
no
power
to
restore
and
defend
the
rights
of
her
citizens
have
not
the
love
of
the
truth
abiding
in
them
congress
has
power
to
protect
the
nation
against
foreign
invasion
and
internal
broil
and
whenever
that
body
passes
an
act
to
maintain
right
with
any
power
or
to
restore
right
to
any
portion
of
her
citizens
it
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
should
a
state
refuse
submission
that
state
is
guilty
of
or
and
the
president
has
as
much
power
to
repel
it
as
washington
had
to
march
against
the
whisky
boys
at
pittsburg
or
general
jackson
had
to
send
an
armed
force
to
suppress
the
rebellion
of
south
carolina
to
close
i
would
admonish
you
before
you
let
your
you
again
to
write
upon
a
subject
great
as
the
salvation
of
man
consequential
as
the
life
of
the
savior
broad
as
the
principles
of
eternal
truth
and
valuable
as
the
jewels
of
eternity
to
read
in
the
eighth
section
and
first
article
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
and
specific
and
not
very
limited
powers
of
the
federal
government
what
can
be
done
to
protect
the
lives
property
and
rights
of
a
virtuous
people
when
the
administrators
of
the
law
and
are
unbought
by
bribes
uncorrupted
by
patronage
untempted
by
gold
unawed
by
fear
and
uncontaminated
tangling
alliances
even
like
caeser
wife
not
only
but
unsuspected
and
god
who
cooled
the
heat
of
a
nebuchadnezzar
furnace
or
shut
the
mouths
of
lions
for
the
honor
of
a
daniel
will
raise
your
mind
above
the
narrow
notion
that
the
general
government
has
no
power
to
the
sublime
idea
that
congress
with
the
president
as
executor
is
as
almighty
in
its
sphere
as
jehovah
is
in
his
with
great
respect
i
have
the

clay
letter
to
joseph
smith
and
the
latter
reply
ashland
november
dear
sir
i
have
received
your
letter
in
behalf
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
stating
that
you
understand
that
i
am
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
inquiring
what
will
be
my
rule
of
action
relative
to
you
as
a
people
should
i
be
elected
i
am
profoundly
grateful
for
the
numerous
and
strong
expressions
of
the
people
in
my
behalf
as
a
candidate
for
president
of
the
united
states
but
i
do
not
so
consider
myself
that
must
depend
upon
future
events
and
upon
my
sense
of
duty
should
i
be
a
candidate
i
can
enter
into
no
engagements
make
no
promises
give
no
pledges
to
any
particular
portion
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
if
i
ever
enter
into
that
high
office
i
must
go
into
it
free
and
unfettered
with
no
guarantees
but
such
as
are
to
be
drawn
from
my
whole
life
character
and
conduct
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
this
declaration
to
say
that
i
have
viewed
with
a
lively
interest
the
progress
of
the
saints
that
i
have
sympathized
in
their
sufferings
under
injustice
as
it
appeared
to
me
which
has
been
inflicted
upon
them
and
i
think
in
common
with
other
religious
communities
they
ought
to
enjoy
the
security
and
protection
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
i
am
with
great
respect
your
friend
and
obedient
servant
clay
to
joseph
smith
esq
nauvoo
may
sir
your
answer
to
my
inquiry
what
would
be
your
rule
of
action
towards
the
saints
should
you
be
elected
president
of
the
united
states
has
been
under
consideration
since
last
november
in
the
fond
expectation
that
you
would
give
for
every
honest
citizen
has
a
right
to
demand
it
to
the
country
a
manifesto
of
your
views
of
the
best
method
and
means
which
would
secure
to
the
people
whole
the
most
freedom
the
most
happiness
the
most
union
the
most
wealth
the
most
fame
the
most
glory
at
home
and
the
most
honor
abroad
at
the
least
expense
but
i
have
waited
in
vain
so
far
as
you
have
made
public
declarations
they
have
been
made
like
your
answer
to
the
above
soft
to
flatter
rather
than
solid
to
feed
the
people
you
seem
to
abandon
all
former
policy
which
may
have
actuated
you
in
the
discharge
of
a
statesman
duty
when
the
vigor
of
intellect
and
the
force
of
virtue
should
have
sought
out
an
everlasting
habitation
for
liberty
when
as
a
wise
man
a
true
patriot
and
a
friend
to
mankind
you
should
have
resolved
to
ameliorate
the
lawful
condition
of
our
country
by
a
mighty
plan
of
wisdom
righteousness
justice
goodness
and
mercy
that
would
have
brought
back
the
golden
days
of
our
nation
youth
vigor
and
vivacity
when
prosperity
crowned
the
efforts
of
a
youthful
republic
when
the
gentle
aspirations
of
the
sons
of
liberty
were
we
are
one
in
your
answer
to
my
questions
last
fall
that
peculiar
tact
of
modern
politicians
declaring
you
ever
enter
into
that
high
office
you
must
go
into
it
free
and
unfettered
with
no
guarantees
but
such
as
are
to
be
drawn
from
your
whole
life
character
and
so
much
resembles
a
sign
with
the
goddess
of
good
luck
sitting
on
the
car
of
fortune
of
the
horns
of
plenty
and
driving
the
merry
steeds
of
beatitude
without
reins
or
bridle
that
i
can
not
help
exclaiming
o
frail
man
what
have
you
done
that
will
exalt
you
can
anything
be
drawn
from
your
character
or
that
is
worthy
of
being
held
up
to
the
gaze
of
this
nation
as
a
model
of
charity
and
wisdom
are
you
not
a
lottery
picture
with
more
than
two
blanks
to
a
prize
leaving
many
things
prior
to
your
ghent
treaty
let
the
world
look
at
that
and
see
where
is
the
wisdom
honor
and
patriotism
which
ought
to
have
characterized
the
plenipotentiary
of
the
only
free
nation
upon
the
earth
a
quarter
of
a
negotiation
to
obtain
our
rights
on
the
boundary
and
the
motley
manner
in
which
oregon
tries
to
shine
as
american
territory
coupled
with
your
presidential
race
and
secretaryship
in
all
go
to
convince
the
friends
of
freedom
the
golden
patriots
of
jeffersonian
democracy
free
trade
and
sailors
rights
and
the
protectors
of
person
and
property
that
an
honorable
war
is
better
than
a
dishonorable
peace
but
had
you
really
wanted
to
have
exhibited
the
wisdom
clemency
benevolence
and
dignity
of
a
great
man
in
this
boasted
republic
when
fifteen
thousand
free
citizens
were
exiled
from
their
own
homes
lands
and
property
in
the
wonderful
patriotic
state
of
missouri
and
you
then
upon
your
oath
and
honor
occupying
the
exalted
station
of
a
senator
of
congress
from
the
state
of
kentucky
why
did
you
not
show
the
world
your
loyalty
to
law
and
order
by
using
all
honorable
means
to
restore
the
innocent
to
their
rights
and
property
why
sir
the
more
we
search
into
your
character
and
conduct
the
more
we
must
exclaim
from
holy
writ
the
tree
is
known
by
its
fruit
again
this
is
not
all
rather
than
show
yourself
an
honest
man
by
guaranteeing
to
the
people
what
you
will
do
in
case
you
should
be
elected
president
you
can
enter
into
no
engagement
make
no
promises
and
give
no
pledges
as
to
what
you
will
do
well
it
may
be
that
some
partisan
would
take
such
nothingarianism
upon
trust
but
sensible
men
and
even
would
think
themselves
insulted
by
such
an
evasion
of
coming
events
if
a
tempest
is
expected
why
not
prepare
to
meet
it
and
in
the
language
of
the
poet
exclaim
then
let
the
trial
come
and
witness
thou
if
terror
be
upon
me
if
i
shrink
or
falter
in
my
strength
to
meet
the
storm
when
hardest
it
besets
me
true
greatness
never
wavers
but
when
the
missouri
compromise
was
entered
into
by
you
for
the
benefit
of
there
was
a
mighty
shrinkage
of
and
from
that
day
sir
the
sterling
yankee
the
struggling
abolitionist
and
the
staunch
democrat
with
a
large
number
of
the
whigs
have
marked
you
as
a
in
politics
begging
for
a
chance
to
yourself
into
the
presidential
chair
where
you
might
deal
out
the
destinies
of
our
beloved
country
for
a
of
that
would
end
in
from
the
tombs
a
doleful
start
not
at
this
picture
for
your
whole
life
character
and
conduct
have
been
spotted
with
deeds
that
cause
a
blush
upon
the
face
of
a
virtuous
patriot
so
you
must
be
contented
in
your
lot
while
crime
cowardice
cupidity
or
low
cunning
have
handed
you
down
from
the
high
tower
of
a
statesman
to
the
of
a
gambler
a
man
that
accepts
a
challenge
or
fights
a
duel
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
murderer
for
holy
writ
declares
that
sheds
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
and
when
in
the
renowned
city
of
washington
the
notorious
dropped
from
the
summit
of
a
senator
to
the
sink
of
a
scoundrel
to
shoot
at
that
of
a
randolph
he
not
only
disgraced
his
own
fame
family
and
friends
but
he
polluted
the
of
american
glory
and
the
kingly
blackguards
throughout
the
whole
world
are
pointing
the
finger
of
scorn
at
the
boasted
asylum
of
the
oppressed
and
hissing
at
american
statesmen
as
vagabonds
and
holding
the
olive
branch
of
peace
in
one
hand
and
a
pistol
for
death
in
the
other
well
might
the
savior
rebuke
the
heads
of
this
nation
with
unto
you
scribes
pharisees
hypocrites
for
the
united
states
government
and
congress
with
a
few
honorable
exceptions
have
gone
the
way
of
cain
and
must
perish
in
their
gainsayings
like
korah
and
his
wicked
host
and
honest
men
of
every
clime
and
the
innocent
poor
and
oppressed
as
well
as
heathens
pagans
and
indians
everywhere
who
could
but
hope
that
the
tree
of
liberty
would
yield
some
precious
fruit
for
the
hungry
human
race
and
shed
some
balmy
leaves
for
the
healing
of
nations
have
long
since
given
up
all
hopes
of
equal
rights
of
justice
and
judgment
and
of
truth
and
virtue
when
such
polluted
vain
bogus
patriots
are
forced
or
flung
into
the
front
rank
of
government
to
guide
the
destinies
of
millions
crape
the
heavens
with
weeds
of
wo
gird
the
earth
with
and
let
hell
mutter
one
melody
in
commemoration
of
fallen
splendor
for
the
glory
of
america
has
departed
and
god
will
set
a
flaming
sword
to
guard
the
tree
of
liberty
while
such
herods
as
van
buren
boggs
benton
calhoun
and
clay
are
thrust
out
of
the
realms
of
virtue
as
fit
subjects
for
the
kingdom
of
fallen
greatness
reprobi
vox
in
your
late
addresses
to
the
people
of
south
carolina
where
rebellion
budded
but
could
not
blossom
you
renounced
ultraism
high
tariff
and
almost
banished
your
banking
system
for
the
more
certain
standard
of
public
opinion
this
is
all
very
well
and
marks
the
intention
of
a
politician
the
calculations
of
a
demagogue
and
the
allowance
for
leeings
of
a
shrewd
manager
just
as
truly
as
the
weathercock
does
the
wind
when
it
turns
upon
the
spire
hustings
for
the
south
barbecues
for
the
west
confidential
letters
for
the
north
and
american
system
for
the
east
baby
upon
the
tree
top
and
when
the
wind
blows
the
cradle
will
rock
suppose
you
should
also
taking
your
whole
life
character
and
conduct
into
consideration
and
as
many
hands
make
light
work
stir
up
the
old
clay
party
the
national
republican
party
the
high
protective
tariff
party
and
the
late
party
with
all
their
paraphernalia
ne
plus
ultraism
sine
qua
which
have
grown
with
your
growth
strengthened
with
your
strength
and
shrunk
with
your
shrinkage
and
ask
the
people
of
this
enlightened
republic
what
they
think
of
your
powers
and
policy
as
a
statesman
for
verily
it
would
seem
from
all
past
remains
of
parties
politics
projects
and
pictures
that
you
are
the
and
the
people
the
and
as
some
vessels
are
marred
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
the
natural
conclusion
is
that
are
a
vessel
of
you
may
complain
that
a
close
examination
of
your
whole
life
character
and
conduct
places
you
as
a
kentuckian
would
pleasantly
term
it
in
a
bad
fix
but
sir
when
the
nation
has
sunk
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
mud
at
every
turn
of
the
great
wheels
of
the
union
while
you
have
acted
as
one
of
the
principal
drivers
it
becomes
the
bounden
duty
of
the
whole
community
as
one
man
to
whisper
you
on
every
point
of
government
to
uncover
every
act
of
your
life
and
inquire
what
mighty
acts
you
have
done
to
benefit
the
nation
how
much
you
have
tithed
the
mint
to
gratify
your
lust
and
why
the
fragments
of
your
raiment
hang
upon
the
thorns
by
the
path
as
signals
to
but
your
is
truly
wonderful
not
only
your
banking
system
and
high
tariff
project
have
vanished
from
your
mind
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
but
the
annexation
of
texas
has
touched
your
pathetic
sensibilities
of
national
pride
so
acutely
that
the
poor
texans
your
own
may
fall
back
into
the
ferocity
of
mexico
or
be
sold
at
auction
to
british
and
all
is
well
for
i
the
old
senator
from
kentucky
and
fearful
it
would
militate
against
my
interest
in
the
north
to
enlarge
the
borders
of
the
union
in
the
south
truly
a
poor
wise
child
is
better
than
an
old
foolish
king
who
will
be
no
longer
admonished
who
ever
heard
of
a
nation
that
had
too
much
territory
was
it
ever
bad
policy
to
make
friends
has
any
people
ever
become
too
good
to
do
good
no
never
but
the
ambition
and
vanity
of
some
men
have
flown
away
with
their
wisdom
and
judgment
and
left
a
croaking
to
occupy
the
place
of
a
noble
why
sir
the
condition
of
the
whole

is
lamentable

dreads

a
tremendous
convulsion

it
is
not

time
for
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
to
pledge
himself
to
execute
judgment
and
justice
in
righteousness
law
or
no
law
but
it
is
his
bounden
duty
as
a
man
for
the
honor
of
a
disgraced
country
and
for
the
salvation
of
a
once
virtuous
people
to
call
for
a
union
of
all
honest
men
and
appease
the
wrath
of
god
by
acts
of
wisdom
holiness
and
virtue
the
fervent
prayer
of
a
righteous
man
availeth
much
perhaps
you
may
think
i
go
too
far
with
my
strictures
and
innuendos
because
in
your
concluding
paragraph
you
say
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
your
declarations
to
say
that
you
have
viewed
with
a
lively
interest
the
progress
of
the
saints
that
you
have
sympathized
in
their
sufferings
under
injustice
as
it
appeared
to
you
which
has
been
inflicted
upon
them
and
that
you
in
common
with
all
other
religious
communities
they
ought
to
enjoy
the
security
and
protection
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
if
words
were
not
wind
and
imagination
not
a
vapor
such
views
a
lively
might
coax
out
a
few
mormon
votes
such
sympathy
for
their
suffering
under
injustice
might
heal
some
of
the
sick
yet
lingering
amongst
them
raise
some
of
the
dead
and
recover
some
of
their
property
from
missouri
and
finally
if
thought
was
not
a
phantom
we
might
in
common
with
other
religious
communities
think
enjoy
the
and
of
the
constitution
and
but
during
ten
years
while
the
saints
have
bled
been
robbed
driven
from
their
own
lands
paid
oceans
of
money
into
the
treasury
to
pay
your

born
in
a
land
of
liberty
and
breathing
an
air
uncorrupted
with
the
sirocco
of
barbarous
climes
i
ever
feel
a
double
anxiety
for
the
happiness
of
all
men
both
in
time
and
in
eternity
my
cogitations
like
daniel
have
for
a
long
time
troubled
me
when
i
viewed
the
condition
of
men
throughout
the
world
and
more
especially
in
this
boasted
realm
where
the
declaration
of
independence
holds
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
but
at
the
same
time
some
two
or
three
millions
of
people
are
held
as
slaves
for
life
because
the
spirit
of
them
is
covered
with
a
darker
skin
than
ours
and
hundreds
of
our
own
kindred
for
an
infraction
or
supposed
infraction
of
some
statute
have
to
be
incarcerated
in
dungeon
glooms
or
suffer
the
more
moral
penitentiary
gravitation
of
mercy
in
a
nutshell
while
the
duelist
the
debauchee
and
the
defaulter
for
millions
and
other
criminals
take
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts
or
like
the
bird
of
passage
find
a
more
congenial
clime
by
flight
the
wisdom
which
ought
to
characterize
the
freest
wisest
and
most
noble
nation
of
the
nineteenth
century
should
like
the
sun
in
his
meridian
splendor
warm
every
object
beneath
its
rays
and
the
main
efforts
of
her
officers
who
are
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
servants
of
the
people
ought
to
be
directed
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
all
black

the
best
of

says
god
hath
made
of

all

presents
to
all

the

the

and
the

without

it

establish

tranquillity

just
what
it
said
without

the
aspirations
and
expectations
of
a
virtuous
people
environed
with
so
wise
so
liberal
so
deep
so
broad
and
so
high
a
charter
of
as
appear
in
said
constitution
ought
to
be
treated
by
those
to
whom
the
administration
of
the
laws
is
entrusted
with
as
much
sanctity
as
the
prayers
of
the
saints
are
treated
in
heaven
that
love
confidence
and
union
like
the
sun
moon

should
bear

for
ever
singing
as

hand
that
made

unity
is

and
when
i
reflect
on
the
importance
of
it
to
the
stability
of
all
governments
i
am
astounded
at
the
silly
moves
of
persons
and
parties
to
foment
discord
in
order
to
ride
into
power
on
the
current
of
popular
excitement
nor
am
i
less
surprised
at
the
stretches
of
power
or
restrictions
of
right
which
too
often
appear
as
acts
of
legislators
to
pave
the
way
to
some
favorite
political
scheme
as
destitute
of
intrinsic
merit
as
a
wolf
heart
is
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
a
frenchman
would
say
tout
aimer
richesses
et
almost
all
men
like
wealth
and
power
i
must
dwell
on
this
subject
longer
than
others
for
nearly
one
hundred
years
ago
that
golden
patriot
benjamin
franklin
drew
up
a
plan
of
union
for
the
then
colonies
of
great
britain
that
are
such
an
independent
nation
which
among
many
wise
provisions
for
obedient
children
under
their
father
more
rugged
hand
had
this
they
have
power
to
make
laws
and
lay
and
levy
such
general
duties
imports
or
taxes
as
to
them
shall
appear
most
equal
and
just
considering
the
ability
and
other
circumstances
of
the
inhabitants
in
the
several
colonies
and
such
as
may
be
collected
with
the
least
inconvenience
to
the
people
rather
discouraging
luxury
than
loading
industry
with
unnecessary
burdens
great
britain
surely
lacked
the
laudable
humanity
and
fostering
clemency
to
grant
such
a
just
plan
of
union
but
the
sentiment
remains
like
the
land
that
honored
its
birth
as
a
pattern
for
wise
men
study
the
convenience
of
the
people
more
than
the
comfort
of
the
and
one
of
the
most
noble
fathers
of
our
freedom
and
country
glory
great
in
war
great
in
peace
great
in
the
estimation
of
the
world
and
great
in
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
the
illustrious
washington
said
in
his
first
inaugural
address
to
congress
i
behold
the
surest
pledges
that
as
on
one
side
no
local
prejudices
or
attachments
no
separate
views
or
party
animosities
will
misdirect
the
comprehensive
and
equal
eye
which
ought
to
watch
over
this
great
assemblage
of
communities
and
interests
so
on
another
that
the
foundations
of
our
national
policy
will
be
laid
in
the
pure
and
immutable
principles
of
private
morality
and
the
of
free
government
be
exemplified
by
all
the
attributes
which
can
win
the
affections
of
its
citizens
and
command
the
respect
of
the
world
verily
here
shine
the
virtue
and
wisdom
of
a
statesman
in
such
lucid
rays
that
had
every
succeeding
congress
followed
the
rich
instruction
in
all
their
deliberations
and
enactments
for
the
benefit
and
convenience
of
the
whole
community
and
the
communities
of
which
it
is
composed
no
sound
of
rebellion
in
south
carolina
no
rupture
in
rhode
island
no
mob
in
missouri
expelling
her
citizens
by
executive
authority
corruption
in
the
ballot
boxes
a
border
warfare
between
ohio
and
michigan
hard
times
and
distress
outbreak
upon
outbreak
in
the
principal
cities
murder
robbery
and
defalcation
scarcity
of
money
and
a
thousand
other
difficulties
would
have
torn
asunder
the
bonds
of
the
union
destroyed
the
confidence
of
man
with
man
and
left
the
great
body
of
the
people
to
mourn
over
misfortunes
in
poverty
brought
on
by
corrupt
legislation
in
an
hour
of
proud
vanity
for
the
great
washington
soon
after
the
foregoing
faithful
admonition
for
the
common
welfare
of
his
nation
further
advised
congress
that
among
the
many
interesting
objects
which
will
engage
your
attention
that
of
providing
for
the
common
defense
will
merit
particular
regard
to
be
prepared
for
war
is
one
of
the
most
effectual
means
of
preserving
peace
as
the
italian
would
say
good
advice
the
elder
adams
in
his
inaugural
address
gives
national
pride
such
a
grand
turn
of
justification
that
every
honest
citizen
must
look
back
upon
the
infancy
of
the
united
states
with
an
approving
smile
and
rejoice
that
patriotism
in
their
rulers
virtue
in
the
people
and
prosperity
in
the
union
once
crowned
the
expectations
of
hope
unveiled
the
sophistry
of
the
hypocrite
and
silenced
the
folly
of
foes
adams
said
if
national
pride
is
ever
justifiable
or
excusable
it
is
when
it
springs
not
from
or
riches
grandeur
or
glory
but
from
conviction
of
national
innocence
information
and
benevolence
there
is
no
doubt
that
such
was
actually
the
case
with
our
young
realm
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
peace
prosperity
and
union
filled
the
country
with
religious
toleration
temporal
enjoyment
and
virtuous
enterprise
and
grandly
too
when
the
deadly
winter
of
the
stamp
act
tea
act
and
other
acts
of
royalty
had
chocked
the
growth
of
freedom
of
speech
liberty
of
the
press
and
liberty
of
conscience
did
light
liberty
and
loyalty
flourish
like
cedars
of
god
the
respected
and
venerable
thomas
jefferson
in
his
inaugural
address
made
more
than
forty
years
ago
shows
what
a
beautiful
prospect
an
innocent
virtuous
nation
presents
to
the
sage
eye
where
there
is
space
for
enterprise
hands
for
industry
heads
for
heroes
and
hearts
for
moral
greatness
he
said
a
rising
nation
spread
over
a
wide
and
fruitful
land
traversing
all
the
seas
with
the
rich
productions
of
their
industry
engaged
in
commerce
with
nations
who
feel
power
and
forget
right
advancing
rapidly
to
destinies
beyond
the
reach
of
mortal
eye
when
i
contemplate
these
transcendent
objects
and
see
the
honor
the
happiness
of
this
beloved
country
committed
to
the
issue
and
auspices
of
this
day
i
shrink
from
the
contemplation
and
humble
myself
before
the
magnitude
of
the
undertaking
such
a
prospect
was
truly
to
a
good
man
but
since
the
fathers
have
fallen
asleep
wicked
and
designing
men
have
unrobed
the
government
of
its
glory
and
the
people
if
not
in
dust
and
ashes
or
in
sackcloth
have
to
lament
in
poverty
her
departed
greatness
while
demagogues
build
fires
in
the
north
and
the
south
east
and
west
to
keep
up
their
spirits
it
is
better
but
year
after
year
has
left
the
people
to
till
the
very
name
of
or
is
as
horrible
to
the
sensitive
friend
of
his
country
as
the
house
of
bluebeard
is
to
his
children
or
hell
of
london
to
meek
men
when
the
people
are
secure
and
their
rights
properly
respected
then
the
four
main
pillars
of
prosperity
agriculture
manufactures
navigation
and
commerce
need
the
fostering
care
of
government
and
in
so
goodly
a
country
as
ours
where
the
soil
the
climate
the
rivers
the
lakes
and
the
sea
coast
the
productions
the
timber
the
minerals
and
the
inhabitants
are
so
diversified
that
a
pleasing
variety
accommodates
all
tastes
trades
and
calculations
it
certainly
is
the
highest
point
of
supervision
to
protect
the
whole
northern
and
southern
eastern
and
western
center
and
circumference
of
the
realm
by
a
judicious
tariff
it
is
an
old
saying
and
a
true
one
if
you
wish
to
be
respect
yourselves
i
will
adopt
in
part
the
language
of
madison
inaugural
address
to
cherish
peace
and
friendly
intercourse
with
all
nations
having
corresponding
dispositions
to
maintain
sincere
neutrality
towards
belligerent
nations
to
prefer
in
all
cases
amicable
discussion
and
reasonable
accommodation
of
differences
to
a
decision
of
them
by
an
appeal
to
arms
to
exclude
foreign
intrigues
and
foreign
partialities
so
degrading
to
all
countries
and
so
baneful
to
free
ones
to
foster
a
spirit
of
independence
too
just
to
invade
the
rights
of
others
too
proud
to
surrender
our
own
too
liberal
to
indulge
unworthy
prejudices
ourselves
and
too
elevated
not
to
look
down
upon
them
in
others
to
hold
the
union
of
the
states
as
the
basis
of
their
peace
and
happiness
to
support
the
constitution
which
is
the
cement
of
the
union
as
well
in
its
limitations
as
in
its
authorities
to
respect
the
rights
and
authorities
reserved
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
as
equally
incorporated
with
and
essential
to
the
success
of
the
general
system
to
avoid
the
slightest
interference
with
the
rights
of
conscience
or
the
functions
of
religion
so
wisely
exempted
from
civil
jurisdiction
to
preserve
in
their
full
energy
the
other
salutary
provisions
in
behalf
of
private
and
personal
rights
and
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
so
far
as
intention
aids
in
the
fulfillment
of
duty
are
consummations
too
big
with
benefits
not
to
captivate
the
energies
of
all
honest
men
to
achieve
them
when
they
can
be
brought
to
pass
by
reciprocation
friendly
alliances
wise

honorable
treaties
the

attained

maturity
which
are
the
best
proofs

it
is
well
known
that
all

blessings
have
been
enjoyed
in

satisfaction
that
there

in

was

gradually
was
paid
up
in

golden
day

years

and
contention
mingled
with
hope
fear
and

through

and
agitated
the
whole
nation
as
would
an
earthquake
at
the
center
of
the
earth
the
world
heaving
the
sea
beyond
its
bounds
and
shaking
the
everlasting
hills
so
in
hopes
of
better
times
while
jealousy
hypocritical
pretensions
and
pompous
ambition
were
luxuriating
on
the
spoils
of
the
people
they
rose
in
their
majesty
like
a
tornado
and
swept
through
the
land
till
general
harrison
appeared
as
a
star
among
the
for
better
weather
the
calm
came
and
the
language
of
that
venerable
patriot
in
his
inaugural
address
while
descanting
upon
the
merits
of
the
constitution
and
its
framers
thus
expressed
himself
there
were
in
it
features
which
appeared
not
to
be
in
harmony
with
their
ideas
of
a
simple
representative
democracy
or
republic
and
knowing
the
tendency
of
power
to
increase
itself
particularly
when
executed
by
a
single
individual
predictions
were
made
that
at
no
very
remote
period
the
government
would
terminate
in
virtual
monarchy
it
would
not
become
me
to
say
that
the
fears
of
these
patriots
have
been
already
realized
but
as
i
sincerely
believe
that
the
tendency
of
measures
and
of
men
opinions
for
some
years
past
has
been
in
that
direction
it
is
i
conceive
strictly
proper
that
i
should
take
this
occasion
to
repeat
the
assurances
i
have
heretofore
given
of
my
determination
to
arrest
the
progress
of
that
tendency
if
it
really
exists
and
restore
the
government
to
its
pristine
health
and
vigor
this
good
man
died
before
he
had
the
opportunity
of
applying
one
balm
to
ease
the
pain
of
our
groaning
country
and
i
am
willing
the
nation
should
be
the
judge
whether
general
harrison
in
his
exalted
station
upon
the
eve
of
his
entrance
into
the

no

can

the

of

is
on
the

that
calamity

confusion

sooner

the

leave
the

in
their
own
pockets
give
every
man
his
constitutional
freedom
and
the
president
full
power
to
send
an
army
to
suppress
mobs
and
the
states
authority
to
repeal
and
impugn
that
relic
of
folly
which
makes
it
necessary
for
the
governor
of
a
state
to
make
the
demand
of
the
president
for
troops
in
case
of
invasion
or
rebellion
the
governor
himself
may
be
a
mobber
and
instead
of
being
punished
as
he
should
be
for
murder
or
treason
he
may
destroy
the
very
lives
rights
and
property
he
should
protect
like
the
good
samaritan
send
every
lawyer
as
soon
as

obeys
the
ordinances
of

to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
destitute
without

pouring
in

a

certainly
more
honorable

direct
no
tangling

oregon
belongs
to
this

honorably
and
when
we
have
the
red
man
consent
let
the
union
spread
from
the
east
to
the
west
sea
and
if
texas
petitions
congress
to
be
adopted
among
the
sons
of
liberty
give
her
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
and
refuse
not
the

friendly
grip
to

and
mexico
and
when
the

arm
of

is
stretched
out
in
the
character
of

of

commerce

let
the
iron
eyes
of

watch
from

and
from

to

thus
may

be
strengthened
and
foreign

prevented

opposing

seventy
years
have
done
much
for
this
goodly
land
they
have
burst
the
chains

over

a

whenever
they
are

of
an
equivalent
for
their

the
country
will
be
full
of

and
confidence
when
a
national
bank
of
twenty
millions
and
a
state
bank
in
every
state
with
a
million
or
more
gives
a
tone
to
monetary
matters
and
make
a
circulating
medium
as
valuable
in
the
purses
of
a
whole
community
as
in
the
coffers
of
a
speculating
banker

the

have

his

of

the

have
such
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
anecdote
of

his
that
when
the

was
so
long
that
it
allowed
slavery
at
the

of

it

not

oh

what
a

might
say

but
his
mighty
whisk
through

great
national
fire
for
the
presidential
chestnuts
the
locks
of
his
glory
with
the
blaze
of
his
in
the

the
people
are
the
government
and
their
united
voice
is
the
only
sovereign
that
should
rule
the
only
power
that
should
be
obeyed
and
the
only
gentlemen
that
should
be
honored
at
home
and
abroad
on
the
land
and
on
the
sea
wherefore
were
i
the
president
of
the
united
states
by
the
voice
of
a
virtuous
people
i
would
honor
the
old
paths
of
the
venerated
fathers
of
freedom
i
would
walk
in
the
tracks
of
the
illustrious
patriots
who
carried
the
ark
of
the
government
upon
their
shoulders
with
an
eye
single
to
the
glory
of
the
people
and
when
that
people
petitioned
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
slave
states
i
would
use
all
honorable
means
to
have
their
prayers
granted
and
give
liberty
to
the
captive
by
paying
the
southern
gentlemen
a
reasonable
equivalent
for
his
property
that
the
whole
nation
might
be
free
indeed
when
the
people
petitioned
for
a
national
bank
i
would
use
my
best
endeavors
to
have
their
prayers
answered
and
establish
one
on
national
principles
to
save
taxes
and
make
them
the
controllers
of
its
ways
and
means
and
when
the
people
petitioned
to
possess
the
territory
of
oregon
or
any
other
contiguous
territory
i
would
lend
the
influence
of
a
chief
magistrate
to
grant
so
reasonable
a
request
that
they
might
extend
the
mighty
efforts
and
enterprise
of
a
free
people
from
the
east
to
the
west
sea
and
make
the
wilderness
blossom
as
the
rose
and
when
a
neighboring
realm
petitioned
to
join
the
union
of
the
sons
of
liberty
my
voice
would
be
yea
come
texas
come
mexico
come
canada
and
come
all
the
world
let
us
be
brethren
let
us
be
one
great
family
and
let
there
be
a
universal
peace
abolish
the
cruel
custom
of
prisons
except
certain
cases
penitentiaries
for
desertion
and
let
reason
and
friendship
reign
over
the
ruins
of
ignorance
and
barbarity
yea
i
would
as
the
universal
friend
of
man
open
the
prisons
open
the
eyes
open
the
ears
and
open
the
hearts
of
all
people
to
behold
and
enjoy
freedom
unadulterated
freedom
and
god
who
once
cleansed
the
violence
of
the
earth
with
a
flood
whose
son
laid
down
his
life
for
the
salvation
of
all
his
father
gave
him
out
of
the
world
and
who
has
promised
that
he
will
come
and
purify
the
world
again
with
fire
in
the
last
days
should
be
supplicated
by
me
for
the
good
of

appendix
iv
an
account
of
the
martyrdom
of
joseph
smith
by
president
john
taylor
being
requested
by
elders
george
smith
and
wilford
woodruff
church
historians
to
write
an
account
of
events
that
transpired
before
and
took
place
at
the
time
of
the
martyrdom
of
joseph
smith
in
carthage
jail
in
hancock
county
state
of
illinois
i
write
the
following
principally
from
memory
not
having
access
at
this
time
to
any
public
documents
relative
thereto
farther
than
a
few
desultory
items
contained
in
ford
history
of
illinois
i
must
also
acknowledge
myself
considerably
indebted
to
george
smith
who
was
with
me
when
i
wrote
it
and
who
although
not
there
at
the
time
of
the
bloody
transaction
yet
from
conversing
with
several
persons
who
were
in
the
capacity
of
church
historians
and
aided
by
an
excellent
memory
has
rendered
me
considerable
service
these
and
the
few
items
contained
in
the
note
at
the
end
of
this
account
are
all
the
aid
i
have
had
i
would
further
add
that
the
items
contained
in
the
letter
in
relation
to
dates
especially
may
be
considered
strictly
correct
after
having
written
the
whole
i
read
it
over
to
the
hon
bernhisel
who
with
one
or
two
slight
alterations
pronounced
it
strictly
correct
brother
bernhisel
was
present
most
of
the
time
i
am
afraid
that
from
the
length
of
time
that
has
transpired
since
the
occurrence
and
having
to
rely
almost
exclusively
upon
my
memory
there
may
be
some
slight
inaccuracies
but
i
believe
that
in
the
general
it
is
strictly
correct
as
i
figured
in
those
transaction
from
the
commencement
to
the
end
they
left
no
slight
impression
on
my
mind
in
the
year
a
very
great
excitement
prevailed
in
some
parts
of
hancock
brown
and
other
neighboring
counties
of
illinois
in
relation
to
the
mormons
and
a
spirit
of
vindictive
hatred
and
persecution
was
exhibited
among
the
people
which
was
manifested
in
the
most
bitter
and
acrimonious
language
as
well
as
by
acts
of
hostility
and
violence
frequently
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
vicinity
and
utter
annihilation
of
the
mormons
and
mormonism
and
in
some
instances
breaking
out
in
the
most
violent
acts
of
ruffianly
barbarity
persons
were
kidnapped
whipped
persecuted
and
falsely
accused
of
various
crimes
their
cattle
and
houses
injured
destroyed
or
stolen
vexatious
prosecutions
were
instituted
to
harass
and
annoy
in
some
remote
neighborhoods
they
were
expelled
from
their
homes
without
redress
and
in
others
violence
was
threatened
to
their
persons
and
property
while
in
others
every
kind
of
insult
and
indignity
were
heaped
upon
them
to
induce
them
to
abandon
their
homes
the
county
or
the
state
these
annoyances
prosecutions
and
persecutions
were
instigated
through
different
agencies
and
by
various
classes
of
men
actuated
by
different
motives
but
all
uniting
in
the
one
object
prosecution
persecution
and
extermination
of
the
saints
there
were
a
number
of
wicked
and
corrupt
men
living
in
nauvoo
and
its
vicinity
who
had
belonged
to
the
church
but
whose
conduct
was
incompatible
with
the
gospel
they
were
accordingly
dealt
with
by
the
church
and
severed
from
its
communion
some
of
these
had
been
prominent
members
and
held
official
stations
either
in
the
city
or
church
among
these
were
john
bennett
formerly
mayor
william
law
counselor
to
joseph
smith
wilson
law
his
natural
brother
and
general
in
the
nauvoo
legion
foster
a
man
of
some
property
but
with
a
very
bad
reputation
francis
and
chauncey
higbee
the
latter
a
young
lawyer
and
both
sons
of
a
respectable
and
honored
man
in
the
church
known
as
judge
elias
higbee
who
died
about
twelve
months
before
besides
these
there
were
a
great
many
apostates
both
in
the
city
and
county
of
less
notoriety
who
for
their
delinquencies
had
been
expelled
from
the
church
john
bennett
and
francis
and
chauncey
higbee
were
cut
off
from
the
church
the
former
was
also
cashiered
from
his
generalship
for
the
most
flagrant
acts
of
seduction
and
adultery
and
the
developments
in
the
cases
were
so
scandalous
that
the
high
council
before
which
they
were
tried
had
to
sit
with
closed
doors
william
law
although
counselor
to
joseph
was
found
to
be
his
most
bitter
foe
and
maligner
and
to
hold
intercourse
contrary
to
all
law
in
his
own
house
with
a
young
lady
resident
with
him
and
it
was
afterwards
proven
that
he
had
conspired
with
some
missourians
to
take
joseph
smith
life
and
was
only
saved
by
josiah
arnold
and
daniel
garn
who
being
on
guard
at
his
house
prevented
the
assassins
from
seeing
him
yet
although
having
murder
in
his
heart
his
manners
were
generally
courteous
and
mild
and
he
was
well
calculated
to
deceive
general
wilson
law
was
cut
off
from
the
church
for
seduction
falsehood
and
defamation
both
the
above
were
also
by
the
nauvoo
legion
and
expelled
foster
was
also
cut
off
i
believe
for
dishonesty
fraud
and
falsehood
i
know
he
was
eminently
guilty
of
the
whole
but
whether
these
were
the
specific
charges
or
not
i
know
but
i
do
know
that
he
was
a
notoriously
wicked
and
corrupt
man
besides
the
above
characters
and
mormonic
apostates
there
were
other
three
parties
the
first
of
these
may
be
called
religionists
the
second
politicians
and
the
third
counterfeiters
and
the
religious
party
were
chagrined
and
maddened
because
mormonism
came
in
contact
with
their
religion
and
they
could
not
oppose
it
from
the
scriptures
thus
like
the
ancient
jews
when
enraged
at
the
exhibition
of
their
follies
and
hypocrisies
by
jesus
and
his
apostles
so
these
were
infuriated
against
the
mormons
because
of
their
discomfiture
by
them
and
instead
of
owning
the
truth
and
rejoicing
in
it
they
were
ready
to
gnash
upon
them
with
their
teeth
and
to
persecute
the
believers
in
principles
which
they
could
not
disprove
the
political
party
were
those
who
were
of
opposite
politics
to
us
there
were
always
two
parties
the
whigs
and
democrats
and
we
could
not
vote
for
one
without
offending
the
other
and
it
not
unfrequently
happened
that
candidates
for
office
would
place
the
issue
of
their
election
upon
opposition
to
the
mormons
in
order
to
gain
political
influence
from
the
religious
prejudice
in
which
case
the
mormons
were
compelled
in
to
vote
against
them
which
resulted
almost
invariably
against
our
opponents
this
made
them
angry
and
although
it
was
of
their
own
making
and
the
mormons
could
not
be
expected
to
do
otherwise
yet
they
raged
on
account
of
their
discomfiture
and
sought
to
wreak
their
fury
on
the
mormons
as
an
instance
of
the
above
when
joseph
duncan
was
candidate
for
the
office
of
governor
of
illinois
he
pledged
himself
to
his
party
that
if
he
could
be
elected
he
would
exterminate
or
drive
the
mormons
from
the
state
the
consequence
was
that
governor
ford
was
elected
the
whigs
seeing
that
they
had
been
by
the
democrats
in
securing
the
mormon
vote
became
seriously
alarmed
and
sought
to
repair
their
disaster
by
raising
a
crusade
against
the
people
the
whig
newspapers
teemed
with
accounts
of
the
wonders
and
enormities
of
nauvoo
and
of
the
awful
wickedness
of
a
party
which
could
consent
to
receive
the
support
of
such
miscreants
governor
duncan
who
was
really
a
brave
honest
man
and
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
getting
the
mormon
charters
passed
through
the
legislature
took
the
stump
on
this
subject
in
good
earnest
and
expected
to
be
elected
governor
almost
on
this
question
alone
the
third
party
composed
of
counterfeiters
and
were
a
pack
of
scoundrels
that
infested
the
whole
of
the
western
country
at
that
time
in
some
districts
their
influence
was
so
great
as
to
control
important
state
and
county
offices
on
this
subject
governor
ford
has
the
following
then
again
the
northern
part
of
the
state
was
not
destitute
of
its
organized
bands
of
rogues
engaged
in
murders
robberies
and
in
making
and
passing
counterfeit
money
these
rogues
were
scattered
all
over
the
north
but
the
most
of
them
were
located
in
the
counties
of
ogle
winnebago
lee
and
de
kalb
in
the
county
of
ogle
they
were
so
numerous
strong
and
well
organized
that
they
could
not
be
convicted
for
their
crimes
by
getting
some
of
their
numbers
on
the
juries
by
producing
a
host
of
witnesses
to
sustain
their
defense
by
perjured
evidence
and
by
changing
the
venue
of
one
county
to
another
by
continuances
from
term
to
term
and
by
the
inability
of
witnesses
to
attend
from
time
to
time
at
distant
and
foreign
counties
they
most
generally
managed
to
be
acquitted
there
was
a
combination
of
extending
from
galena
to
alton
there
were
counterfeiters
engaged
in
merchandising
trading
and
in
most
of
the
cities
and
villages
and
in
some
districts
i
have
been
credibly
informed
by
men
to
whom
they
have
disclosed
their
secrets
the
judges
sheriffs
constables
and
jailors
as
well
as
professional
men
were
more
or
less
associated
with
them
these
had
in
their
employ
the
most
reckless
abandoned
wretches
who
stood
ready
to
carry
into
effect
the
most
desperate
enterprises
and
were
careless
alike
of
human
life
and
property
their
object
in
persecuting
the
mormons
was
in
part
to
cover
their
own
rascality
and
in
part
to
prevent
them
from
exposing
and
prosecuting
them
but
the
principal
reason
was
plunder
believing
that
if
they
could
be
removed
or
driven
they
would
be
made
fat
on
mormon
spoils
besides
having
in
the
deserted
city
a
good
asylum
for
the
prosecution
of
their
diabolical
pursuits
this
conglomeration
of
apostate
mormons
religious
bigots
political
fanatics
and
all
united
their
forces
against
the
mormons
and
organized
themselves
into
a
party
denominated
some
of
them
we
have
reason
to
believe
joined
the
church
in
order
to
cover
their
infamous
practices
and
when
they
were
expelled
for
their
unrighteousness
only
raged
with
greater
violence
they
circulated
every
kind
of
falsehood
that
they
could
collect
or
manufacture
against
the
mormons
they
also
had
a
paper
to
assist
them
in
their
nefarious
designs
called
the
edited
by
a
thomas
sharp
a
violent
and
unprincipled
man
who
shrunk
not
from
any
enormity
the
had
public
meetings
which
were
very
numerously
attended
where
they
passed
resolutions
of
the
most
violent
and
inflammatory
kind
threatening
to
drive
expel
and
exterminate
the
mormons
from
the
state
at
the
same
time
accusing
them
of
every
evil
in
the
vocabulary
of
crime
they
appointed
their
meetings
in
various
parts
of
hancock
and
other
counties
which
soon
resulted
in
the
organization
of
armed
mobs
under
the
direction
of
officers
who
reported
to
their
headquarters
and
the
reports
of
which
were
published
in
the
paper
and
circulated
through
the
adjoining
counties
we
also
published
in
the
and
and
the
two
papers
published
and
edited
by
me
at
that
time
an
account
not
only
of
their
proceedings
but
our
own
but
such
was
the
hostile
feeling
so
well
arranged
their
plans
and
so
desperate
and
lawless
their
measures
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
we
could
get
our
papers
circulated
they
were
destroyed
by
postmasters
and
others
and
scarcely
ever
arrived
at
the
place
of
their
destination
so
that
a
great
many
of
the
people
who
would
have
been
otherwise
peaceable
were
excited
by
their
misrepresentations
and
instigated
to
join
their
hostile
or
predatory
bands
emboldened
by
the
acts
of
those
outside
the
apostate
mormons
associated
with
others
commenced
the
publication
of
a
libelous
paper
in
nauvoo
called
the
this
paper
not
only
reprinted
from
the
others
but
put
in
circulation
the
most
libelous
false
and
infamous
reports
concerning
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
and
especially
the
ladies
it
was
however
no
sooner
put
in
circulation
than
the
indignation
of
the
whole
community
was
aroused
so
much
so
that
they
threatened
its
annihilation
and
i
do
not
believe
that
in
any
other
city
of
the
united
states
if
the
same
charges
had
been
made
against
the
citizens
it
would
have
been
permitted
to
remain
one
day
as
it
was
among
us
under
these
circumstances
it
was
thought
best
to
convene
the
city
council
to
take
into
consideration
the
adoption
of
some
measures
for
its
removal
as
it
was
deemed
better
that
this
should
be
done
legally
than
illegally
joseph
smith
therefore
who
was
mayor
convened
the
city
council
for
that
purpose
the
paper
was
introduced
and
read
and
the
subject
examined
all
or
nearly
all
present
expressed
their
indignation
at
the
course
taken
by
the
which
was
owned
by
some
of
the
aforesaid
apostates

with
one
or
two
others

who
were
not
mormons
together
with
the
outside
of
the
city
sustained
it
the
calculation
was
by
false
statements
to
unsettle
the
minds
of
many
in
the
city
and
to
form
combinations
there
similar
to
the
associations
outside
of
the
city
various
attempts
had
heretofore
been
made
by
the
party
to
annoy
and
irritate
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
false
accusations
had
been
made
vexatious
lawsuits
instituted
threats
made
and
various
devices
resorted
to
to
influence
the
public
mind
and
if
possible
to
provoke
us
to
the
commission
of
some
overt
act
that
might
make
us
amenable
to
the
law
with
a
perfect
knowledge
therefore
of
the
designs
of
these
infernal
scoundrels
who
were
in
our
midst
as
well
as
those
who
surrounded
us
the
city
council
entered
upon
an
investigation
of
the
matter
they
felt
that
they
were
in
a
critical
position
and
that
any
move
made
for
the
abating
of
that
press
would
be
looked
upon
or
at
least
represented
as
a
direct
attack
upon
the
liberty
of
speech
and
that
so
far
from
displeasing
our
enemies
it
would
be
looked
upon
by
them
as
one
of
the
best
circumstances
that
could
transpire
to
assist
them
in
their
nefarious
and
bloody
designs
being
a
member
of
the
city
council
i
well
remember
the
feeling
of
responsibility
that
seemed
to
rest
upon
all
present
nor
shall
i
soon
forget
the
bold
manly
independent
expressions
of
joseph
smith
on
that
occasion
in
relation
to
this
matter
he
exhibited
in
glowing
colors
the
meanness
corruption
and
ultimate
designs
of
the
their
despicable
characters
and
ungodly
influences
especially
of
those
who
were
in
our
midst
he
told
of
the
responsibility
that
rested
upon
us
as
guardians
of
the
public
interest
to
stand
up
in
the
defense
of
the
injured
and
oppressed
to
stem
the
current
of
corruption
and
as
men
and
saints
to
put
a
stop
to
this
flagrant
outrage
upon
this
people
rights
he
stated
that
no
man
was
a
stronger
advocate
for
the
liberty
of
speech
and
of
the
press
than
himself
yet
when
this
noble
gift
is
utterly
prostituted
and
abused
as
in
the
present
instance
it
loses
all
claim
to
our
respect
and
becomes
as
great
an
agent
for
evil
as
it
can
possibly
be
for
good
and
notwithstanding
the
apparent
advantage
we
should
give
our
enemies
by
this
act
yet
it
behooved
us
as
men
to
act
independent
of
all
secondary
influences
to
perform
the
part
of
men
of
enlarged
minds
and
boldly
and
fearlessly
to
discharge
the
duties
devolving
upon
us
by
declaring
as
a
nuisance
and
removing
this
filthy
libelous
and
seditious
sheet
from
our
midst
the
subject
was
discussed
in
various
forms
and
after
the
remarks
made
by
the
mayor
every
one
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
one
else
to
speak
after
a
considerable
pause
i
arose
and
expressed
my
feelings
frankly
as
joseph
had
done
and
numbers
of
others
followed
in
the
same
strain
and
i
think
but
am
not
certain
that
i
made
a
motion
for
the
removal
of
that
press
as
a
nuisance
this
motion
was
finally
put
and
carried
by
all
but
one
and
he
conceded
that
the
measure
was
just
but
abstained
through
fear
several
members
of
the
city
council
were
not
in
the
church
the
following
is
the
bill
referred
to
for
removing
of
the
press
of
resolved
by
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
that
the
from
whence
issues
the
is
a
public
nuisance
and
also
of
said
which
may
be
or
exist
in
said
establishment
and
the
mayor
is
instructed
to
cause
said
establishment
and
papers
to
be
removed
without
delay
in
such
manner
as
he
shall
direct
passed
june
geo
harris
president
richards
recorder
after
the
passage
of
the
bill
the
marshal
john
greene
was
ordered
to
abate
or
remove
which
he
forthwith
proceeded
to
do
by
summoning
a
posse
of
men
for
that
purpose
the
press
was
removed
or
broken
i
remember
which
by
the
marshal
and
the
types
scattered
in
the
street
this
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
extreme
cases
that
require
extreme
measures
as
the
press
was
still
proceeding
in
its
inflammatory
course
it
was
feared
that
as
it
was
almost
universally
execrated
should
it
continue
longer
an
indignant
people
might
commit
some
overt
act
which
might
lead
to
serious
consequences
and
that
it
was
better
to
use
legal
than
illegal
means
this
as
was
foreseen
was
the
very
course
our
enemies
wished
us
to
pursue
as
it
afforded
them
an
opportunity
of
circulating
a
very
plausible
story
about
the
mormons
being
opposed
to
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
of
free
speech
which
they
were
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
of
stories
were
fabricated
and
facts
perverted
false
statements
were
made
and
this
act
brought
in
as
an
example
to
sustain
the
whole
of
their
fabrications
and
as
if
inspired
by
satan
they
labored
with
an
energy
and
zeal
worthy
of
a
better
cause
they
had
runners
to
circulate
their
reports
not
only
through
hancock
county
but
in
all
the
surrounding
counties
these
reports
were
communicated
to
their
societies
and
these
societies
circulated
them
in
their
several
districts
the
paper
the
was
filled
with
inflammatory
articles
and
misrepresentations
in
relation
to
us
and
especially
to
this
act
of
destroying
the
press
we
were
represented
as
a
horde
of
lawless
ruffians
and
brigands
and
steeped
in
crime
and
iniquity
opposed
to
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
and
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
a
free
and
enlightened
people
that
neither
person
nor
property
were
secure
that
we
had
designs
upon
the
citizens
of
illinois
and
of
the
united
states
and
the
people
were
called
upon
to
rise
and
put
us
down
drive
us
away
or
exterminate
us
as
a
pest
to
society
and
alike
dangerous
to
our
neighbors
the
state
and
commonwealth
these
statements
were
extensively
copied
and
circulated
throughout
the
united
states
a
true
statement
of
the
facts
in
question
was
published
by
us
both
in
the
and
and
the
neighbor
but
it
was
found
impossible
to
circulate
them
in
the
immediate
counties
as
they
were
destroyed
in
the
or
otherwise
by
the
agents
of
the
and
in
order
to
get
the
mail
to
go
abroad
i
had
to
send
the
papers
a
distance
of
thirty
or
forty
miles
from
nauvoo
and
sometimes
to
louis
upward
of
two
hundred
miles
to
insure
their
proceeding
on
their
route
and
then
or
of
the
papers
never
reached
the
place
of
destination
being
intercepted
or
destroyed
by
our
enemies
these
false
reports
stirred
up
the
community
around
of
whom
many
on
account
of
religious
prejudice
were
easily
instigated
to
join
the
and
embark
in
any
crusade
that
might
be
undertaken
against
us
hence
their
ranks
swelled
in
numbers
and
new
organizations
were
formed
meetings
were
held
resolutions
passed
and
men
and
means
volunteered
for
the
extirpation
of
the
mormons
on
these
points
governor
ford
writes
these
also
were
the
active
men
in
blowing
up
the
fury
of
the
people
in
hopes
that
a
popular
movement
might
be
set
on
foot
which
would
result
in
the
expulsion
or
extermination
of
the
mormon
voters
for
this
purpose
public
meetings
had
been
called
inflammatory
speeches
had
been
made
exaggerated
reports
had
been
extensively
circulated
committees
had
been
appointed
who
rode
night
and
day
to
spread
the
reports
and
solicit
the
aid
of
neighboring
counties
and
at
a
public
meeting
at
warsaw
resolutions
were
passed
to
expel
or
exterminate
the
mormon
population
this
was
not
however
a
movement
which
was
unanimously
concurred
in
the
county
contained
a
goodly
number
of
inhabitants
in
favor
of
peace
or
who
at
least
desired
to
be
neutral
in
such
a
contest
these
were
stigmatized
by
the
name
of
and
there
were
not
a
few
of
the
more
furious
exciters
of
the
people
who
openly
expressed
their
intention
to
involve
them
in
the
common
expulsion
or
extermination
a
system
of
excitement
and
agitation
was
artfully
planned
and
executed
with
tact
it
consisted
in
spreading
reports
and
rumors
of
the
most
fearful
character
as
examples
on
the
morning
before
my
arrival
at
carthage
i
was
awakened
at
an
early
hour
by
the
frightful
report
which
was
asserted
with
confidence
and
apparent
consternation
that
the
mormons
had
already
commenced
the
work
of
burning
destruction
and
murder
and
that
every
man
capable
of
bearing
arms
was
instantly
wanted
at
carthage
for
the
protection
of
the
county
we
lost
no
time
in
starting
but
when
we
arrived
at
carthage
we
could
hear
no
more
concerning
this
story
again
during
the
few
days
that
the
militia
were
encamped
at
carthage
frequent
applications
were
made
to
me
to
send
a
force
here
and
a
force
there
and
a
force
all
about
the
country
to
prevent
murders
robberies
and
larcenies
which
it
was
said
were
threatened
by
the
mormons
no
such
forces
were
sent
nor
were
any
such
offenses
committed
at
that
time
except
the
stealing
of
some
provisions
and
there
was
never
the
least
proof
that
this
was
done
by
a
mormon
again
on
my
late
visit
to
hancock
county
i
was
informed
by
some
of
their
violent
enemies
that
the
larcenies
of
the
mormons
had
become
unusually
numerous
and
insufferable
they
admitted
that
but
little
had
been
done
in
this
way
in
their
immediate
vicinity
but
they
insisted
that
sixteen
horses
had
been
stolen
by
the
mormons
in
one
night
near
lima
and
upon
inquiry
was
told
that
no
horses
had
been
stolen
in
that
neighborhood
but
that
sixteen
horses
had
been
stolen
in
one
night
in
hancock
county
this
last
informant
being
told
of
the
hancock
story
again
changed
the
venue
to
another
distant
settlement
in
the
northern
edge
of
adams
in
the
meantime
legal
proceedings
were
instituted
against
the
members
of
the
city
council
of
nauvoo
a
writ
here
subjoined
was
issued

given
under
my

and
seal
at

in
the
county

this
day
of
june
thomas
morrison
seal
the
council
did
not
refuse
to
attend
to
the
legal
proceedings
in
the
case
but
as
the
law
of
illinois
made
it
the
privilege
of
the
persons
accused
to
go
or
appear
before
the
issuer
of
the
writ
or
any
other
justice
of
the
peace
they
requested
to
be
taken
before
another
magistrate
either
in
the
city
of
nauvoo
or
at
any
reasonable
distance
out
of
it
this
the
constable
who
was
a
mobocrat
refused
to
do
and
as
this
was
our
legal
privilege
we
refused
to
be
dragged
contrary
to
law
a
distance
of
eighteen
miles
when
at
the
same
time
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
an
organized
band
of
mobocrats
were
assembled
for
the
purpose
of
extermination
or
murder
and
among
whom
it
would
not
be
safe
to
go
without
a
superior
force
of
armed
men
a
writ
of
was
called
for
and
issued
by
the
municipal
court
of
nauvoo
taking
us
out
of
the
hands
of
bettesworth
and
placing
us
in
the
charge
of
the
city
marshal
we
went
before
the
municipal
court
and
were
dismissed
our
refusal
to
obey
this
illegal
proceeding
was
by
them
construed
into
a
refusal
to
submit
to
law
and
circulated
as
such
and
the
people
either
did
believe
or
professed
to
believe
that
we
were
in
open
rebellion
against
the
laws
and
the
authorities
of
the
state
hence
mobs
began
to
assemble
among
which
all
through
the
country
inflammatory
speeches
were
made
exciting
them
to
mobocracy
and
violence
soon
they
commenced
their
depredations
in
our
outside
settlements
kidnapping
some
and
whipping
and
otherwise
abusing
others
the
persons
thus
abused
fled
to
nauvoo
as
soon
as
practicable
and
related
their
injuries
to
joseph
smith
then
mayor
of
the
city
and
lieutenant
general
of
the
nauvoo
legion
they
also
went
before
magistrates
and
made
affidavits
of
what
they
had
suffered
seen
and
heard
these
affidavits
in
connection
with
a
copy
of
all
our
proceedings
were
forwarded
by
joseph
smith
to
ford
then
governor
of
illinois
with
an
expression
of
our
desire
to
abide
law
and
a
request
that
the
governor
would
instruct
him
how
to
proceed
in
the
case
of
arrival
of
an
armed
mob
against
the
city
the
governor
sent
back
instructions
to
joseph
smith
that
as
he
was
lieutenant
general
of
the
nauvoo
legion
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
the
city
and
surrounding
country
and
issued
orders
to
that
effect
upon
the
reception
of
these
orders
joseph
smith
assembled
the
people
of
the
city
and
laid
before
them
the
governor
instructions
he
also
convened
the
officers
of
the
nauvoo
legion
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
in
relation
to
the
best
mode
of
defense
he
also
issued
orders
to
the
men
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
in
case
of
being
called
upon
on
the
following
day
general
joseph
smith
with
his
staff
the
leading
officers
of
the
legion
and
some
prominent
strangers
who
were
in
our
midst
made
a
survey
of
the
outside
boundaries
of
the
city
which
was
very
extensive
being
about
five
miles
up
and
down
the
river
and
about
two
and
a
half
back
in
the
center
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
position
of
the
ground
and
the
feasibility
of
defense
and
to
make
all
necessary
arrangements
in
case
of
an
attack
it
may
be
well
here
to
remark
that
numbers
of
gentlemen
strangers
to
us
either
came
on
purpose
or
were
passing
through
nauvoo
and
upon
learning
the
position
of
things
expressed
their
indignation
against
our
enemies
and
avowed
their
readiness
to
assist
us
by
their
counsel
or
otherwise
it
was
some
of
these
who
assisted
us
in
reconnoitering
the
city
and
finding
out
its
adaptability
for
defense
and
how
to
protect
it
best
against
an
armed
force
the
legion
was
called
together
and
drilled
and
every
means
made
use
of
for
defense
at
the
call
of
the
officers
old
and
young
men
came
forward
both
from
the
city
and
the
country
and
mustered
to
the
number
of
about
five
thousand
in
the
meantime
our
enemies
were
not
idle
in
mustering
their
forces
and
committing
depredations
nor
had
they
been
it
was
in
fact
their
gathering
that
called
ours
into
existence
their
forces
continued
to
accumulate
they
assumed
a
threatening
attitude
and
assembled
in
large
bodies
armed
and
equipped
for
war
and
threatened
the
destruction
and
extermination
of
the
mormons
an
account
of
their
outrages
and
assemblages
was
forwarded
to
governor
ford
almost
daily
accompanied
by
affidavits
furnished
by
of
their
proceedings
persons
were
also
sent
out
to
the
counties
around
with
pacific
intentions
to
give
them
an
account
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
and
to
notify
them
of
the
feelings
and
dispositions
of
the
people
of
nauvoo
and
thus
if
possible
quell
the
excitement
in
some
of
the
more
distant
counties
these
men
were
very
successful
and
produced
the
salutary
influence
upon
the
minds
of
many
intelligent
and
men
in
neighboring
counties
however
where
influence
prevailed
they
produced
little
effect
at
the
same
time
guards
were
stationed
around
nauvoo
and
picket
guards
in
the
distance
at
length
opposing
forces
gathered
so
near
that
more
active
measures
were
taken
reconnoitering
parties
were
sent
out
and
the
city
proclaimed
under
martial
law
things
now
assumed
a
belligerent
attitude
and
persons
passing
through
the
city
were
questioned
as
to
what
they
knew
of
the
enemy
while
passes
were
in
some
instances
given
to
avoid
difficulty
with
the
guards
joseph
smith
continued
to
send
on
messengers
to
the
governor
philip
lewis
and
other
messengers
were
sent
samuel
james
then
residing
at
la
harpe
carried
a
message
and
dispatches
to
him
and
in
a
day
or
two
after
bishop
edward
hunter
and
others
went
again
with
fresh
dispatches
representations
affidavits
and
instructions
but
as
the
weather
was
excessively
wet
the
rivers
swollen
and
the
bridges
washed
away
in
many
places
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
they
proceeded
on
their
journeys
as
the
mobocracy
had
at
last
attracted
the
governor
attention
he
started
in
company
with
some
others
from
springfield
to
the
scene
of
trouble
and
missed
i
believe
both
brothers
james
and
hunter
on
the
road
and
of
course
did
not
see
their
documents
he
came
to
carthage
and
made
that
place
which
was
a
regular
mobocratic
den
his
headquarters
as
it
was
the
county
seat
however
of
hancock
county
that
circumstance
might
in
a
measure
justify
his
staying
there
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
all
hostility
on
our
part
and
to
fulfill
the
law
in
every
particular
at
the
suggestion
of
judge
thomas
judge
of
that
judicial
district
who
had
come
to
nauvoo
at
the
time
and
who
stated
that
we
had
fulfilled
the
law
but
in
order
to
satisfy
all
he
would
council
us
to
go
before
esquire
wells
who
was
not
in
our
church
and
have
a
hearing
we
did
so
and
after
a
full
hearing
we
were
again
dismissed
the
governor
on
the
road
collected
forces
some
of
whom
were
respectable
but
on
his
arrival
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
difficulties
he
received
as
militia
all
the
companies
of
the
mob
forces
who
united
with
him
after
his
arrival
at
carthage
he
sent
two
gentlemen
from
there
to
nauvoo
as
a
committee
to
wait
upon
general
joseph
smith
informing
him
of
the
arrival
of
his
excellency
with
a
request
that
general
smith
would
send
out
a
committee
to
wait
upon
the
governor
and
represent
to
him
the
state
of
affairs
in
relation
to
the
difficulties
that
then
existed
in
the
county
we
met
this
committee
while
we
were
reconnoitering
the
city
to
find
out
the
best
mode
of
defense
as
aforesaid
bernhisel
and
myself
were
appointed
as
a
committee
by
general
smith
to
wait
upon
the
governor
previous
to
going
however
we
were
furnished
with
affidavits
and
documents
in
relation
both
to
our
proceedings
and
those
of
the
mob
in
addition
to
the
general
history
of
the
transaction
we
took
with
us
a
duplicate
of
those
documents
which
had
been
forwarded
by
bishop
hunter
brother
james
and
others
we
started
from
nauvoo
in
company
with
the
aforesaid
gentlemen
at
about
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
and
arrived
at
carthage
about
we
put
up
at
the
same
hotel
with
the
governor
kept
by
a
hamilton
on
our
arrival
we
found
the
governor
in
bed
but
not
so
with
the
other
inhabitants
the
town
was
filled
with
a
perfect
set
of
rabble
and
rowdies
who
under
the
influence
of
bacchus
seemed
to
be
holding
a
grand
saturnalia
whooping
yelling
and
vociferating
as
if
bedlam
had
broken
loose
on
our
arrival
at
the
hotel
and
while
supper
was
preparing
a
man
came
to
me
dressed
as
a
soldier
and
told
me
that
a
man
named
daniel
garn
had
just
been
taken
prisoner
and
was
about
to
be
committed
to
jail
and
wanted
me
to
go
bail
for
him
believing
this
to
be
a
ruse
to
get
me
out
alone
and
that
some
violence
was
intended
after
consulting
with
bernhisel
i
told
the
man
that
i
was
well
acquainted
with
garn
that
i
knew
him
to
be
a
gentleman
and
did
not
believe
that
he
had
transgressed
law
and
moreover
that
i
considered
it
a
very
singular
time
to
be
holding
courts
and
calling
for
security
particularly
as
the
town
was
full
of
rowdyism
i
informed
him
that
bernhisel
and
myself
would
if
necessary
go
bail
for
him
in
the
morning
but
that
we
did
not
feel
ourselves
safe
among
such
a
set
at
that
late
hour
of
the
night
after
supper
on
retiring
to
our
room
we
had
to
pass
through
another
which
was
separated
from
ours
only
by
a
board
partition
the
beds
in
each
room
being
placed
side
by
side
with
the
exception
of
this
fragile
partition
on
the
bed
that
was
in
the
room
which
we
passed
through
i
discovered
a
man
by
the
name
of
jackson
a
desperate
character
and
a
reputed
notorious
and
murderer
i
hinted
to
the
doctor
that
things
looked
rather
suspicious
and
looked
to
see
that
my
arms
were
in
order
the
doctor
and
i
occupied
one
bed
we
had
scarcely
laid
down
when
a
knock
at
the
door
accompanied
by
a
voice
announced
the
approach
of
chauncey
higbee
the
young
lawyer
and
apostate
before
referred
to
he
addressed
himself
to
the
doctor
and
stated
that
the
object
of
his
visit
was
to
obtain
the
release
of
daniel
garn
that
garn
he
believed
to
be
an
honest
man
that
if
he
had
done
anything
wrong
it
was
through
improper
counsel
and
that
it
was
a
pity
that
he
should
be
incarcerated
particularly
when
he
could
be
so
easily
released
he
urged
the
doctor
as
a
friend
not
to
leave
so
good
a
man
in
such
an
unpleasant
situation
he
finally
prevailed
upon
the
doctor
to
go
and
give
bail
assuring
him
that
on
his
giving
bail
garn
would
be
immediately
dismissed
during
this
conversation
i
did
not
say
a
word
higbee
left
the
doctor
to
dress
with
the
intention
of
returning
and
taking
him
to
the
court
as
soon
as
higbee
had
left
i
told
the
doctor
that
he
had
better
not
go
that
i
believed
this
affair
was
all
a
ruse
to
get
us
separated
that
they
knew
we
had
documents
with
us
from
general
smith
to
show
to
the
governor
that
i
believed
their
object
was
to
get
possession
of
those
papers
and
perhaps
when
they
had
separated
us
to
murder
one
or
both
the
doctor
who
was
actuated
by
the
best
of
motives
in
yielding
to
the
assumed
solicitude
of
higbee
coincided
with
my
views
he
then
went
to
higbee
and
told
him
that
he
had
concluded
not
to
go
that
night
but
that
he
and
i
would
both
wait
upon
the
justice
and
garn
in
the
morning
that
night
i
lay
awake
with
my
pistols
under
my
pillow
waiting
for
any
emergency
nothing
more
occurred
during
the
night
in
the
morning
we
arose
early
and
after
breakfast
sought
an
interview
with
the
governor
and
were
told
that
we
could
have
an
audience
i
think
at
ten
in
the
meantime
we
called
upon
smith
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
had
garn
in
charge
we
represented
that
we
had
been
called
upon
the
night
before
by
two
different
parties
to
go
bail
for
a
daniel
garn
whom
we
were
informed
he
had
in
custody
and
that
believing
garn
to
be
an
honest
man
we
had
now
come
for
that
purpose
and
were
prepared
to
enter
into
recognizances
for
his
appearance
whereupon
smith
the
magistrate
remarked
that
under
the
present
excited
state
of
affairs
he
did
not
think
he
would
be
justified
in
receiving
bail
from
nauvoo
as
it
was
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
property
would
not
be
rendered
valueless
there
in
a
few
days
knowing
the
party
we
had
to
deal
with
we
were
not
much
surprised
at
this
singular
proceeding
we
then
remarked
that
both
of
us
possessed
property
in
farms
out
of
nauvoo
in
the
country
and
referred
him
to
the
county
records
he
then
stated
that
such
was
the
nature
of
the
charge
against
garn
that
he
believed
he
would
not
be
justified
in
receiving
any
bail
we
were
thus
confirmed
in
our
opinion
that
the
night
proceedings
before
in
relation
to
their
desire
to
have
us
give
bail
was
a
mere
ruse
to
separate
us
we
were
not
permitted
to
speak
with
garn
the
real
charge
against
whom
was
that
he
was
traveling
in
carthage
or
its
neighborhood
what
the
fictitious
one
was
if
i
knew
i
have
since
forgotten
as
things
of
this
kind
were
of
daily
occurrence
after
waiting
the
governor
pleasure
for
some
time
we
had
an
audience
but
such
an
audience
he
was
surrounded
by
some
of
the
vilest
and
most
unprincipled
men
in
creation
some
of
them
had
an
appearance
of
respectability
and
many
of
them
lacked
even
that
wilson
and
i
believe
william
law
were
there
foster
frank
and
chauncey
higbee
mar
a
lawyer
from
nauvoo
a
mobocratic
merchant
from
warsaw
the
aforesaid
jackson
a
number
of
his
associates
among
whom
was
the
governor
secretary
in
all
some
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
most
of
whom
were
recreant
to
virtue
honor
integrity
and
everything
that
is
considered
honorable
among
men
i
can
well
remember
the
feelings
of
disgust
that
i
had
in
seeing
the
governor
surrounded
by
such
an
infamous
group
and
on
being
introduced
to
men
of
so
questionable
a
character
and
had
i
been
on
private
business
i
should
have
turned
to
depart
and
told
the
governor
that
if
he
thought
proper
to
associate
with
such
questionable
characters
i
should
beg
leave
to
be
excused
but
coming
as
we
did
on
public
business
we
could
not
of
course
consult
our
private
feelings
we
then
stated
to
the
governor
that
in
accordance
with
his
request
general
smith
had
in
response
to
his
call
sent
us
to
him
as
a
committee
of
conference
that
we
were
acquainted
with
most
of
the
circumstances
that
had
transpired
in
and
about
nauvoo
lately
and
were
prepared
to
give
him
all
information
that
moreover
we
had
in
our
possession
testimony
and
affidavits
confirmatory
of
what
we
should
say
which
had
been
forwarded
to
his
excellency
by
hunter
james
and
others
some
of
which
had
not
reached
their
destination
but
of
which
we
had
duplicates
with
us
we
then
in
brief
related
an
outline
of
the
difficulties
and
the
course
we
had
pursued
from
the
commencement
of
the
trouble
up
to
the
present
and
handing
him
the
documents
respectfully
submitted
the
whole
during
our
conversation
and
explanations
with
the
governor
we
were
frequently
rudely
and
impudently
contradicted
by
the
fellows
he
had
around
him
and
of
whom
he
seemed
to
take
no
notice
he
opened
and
read
a
number
of
the
documents
himself
and
as
he
proceeded
he
was
frequently
interrupted
by
that
a
lie
a
god
damned
lie
that
an
infernal
falsehood
that
a
blasted
lie
etc
these
men
evidently
winced
at
the
exposure
of
their
acts
and
thus
vulgarly
impudently
and
falsely
repudiated
them
one
of
their
number
mar
addressed
himself
several
times
to
me
while
in
conversation
with
the
governor
i
did
not
notice
him
until
after
a
frequent
repetition
of
his
insolence
when
i
informed
him
that
my
business
at
that
time
was
with
governor
ford
whereupon
i
continued
my
conversation
with
his
excellency
during
the
conversation
the
governor
expressed
a
desire
that
joseph
smith
and
all
parties
concerned
in
passing
or
executing
the
city
law
in
relation
to
the
press
had
better
come
to
carthage
that
however
repugnant
it
might
be
to
our
feelings
he
thought
it
would
have
a
tendency
to
allay
public
excitement
and
prove
to
the
people
what
we
professed
that
we
wished
to
be
governed
by
law
we
represented
to
him
the
course
we
had
taken
in
relation
to
this
matter
and
our
willingness
to
go
before
another
magistrate
other
than
the
municipal
court
the
illegal
refusal
of
our
request
by
the
constable
our
dismissal
by
the
municipal
court
a
legally
constituted
tribunal
our
subsequent
trial
before
squire
wells
at
the
instance
of
judge
thomas
the
circuit
judge
and
our
dismissal
by
him
that
we
had
fulfilled
the
law
in
every
particular
that
it
was
our
enemies
who
were
breaking
the
law
and
having
murderous
designs
were
only
making
use
of
this
as
a
pretext
to
get
us
into
their
power
the
governor
stated
that
the
people
viewed
it
differently
and
that
notwithstanding
our
opinions
he
would
recommend
that
the
people
should
be
satisfied
we
then
remarked
to
him
that
should
joseph
smith
comply
with
his
request
it
would
be
extremely
unsafe
in
the
present
excited
state
of
the
country
to
come
without
an
armed
force
that
we
had
a
sufficiency
of
men
and
were
competent
to
defend
ourselves
but
there
might
be
danger
of
collision
should
our
forces
and
those
of
our
enemies
be
brought
into
such
close
proximity
he
strenuously
advised
us
not
to
bring
our
arms
and
his
faith
as
governor
and
the
faith
of
the
state
that
we
should
be
protected
and
that
he
would
guarantee
our
perfect
we
had
at
that
time
about
five
thousand
men
under
arms
one
thousand
of
whom
would
have
been
amply
sufficient
for
our
protection
at
the
termination
of
our
interview
and
previous
to
our
withdrawal
after
a
long
conversation
and
the
perusal
of
the
documents
which
we
had
brought
the
governor
informed
us
that
he
would
prepare
a
written
communication
for
general
joseph
smith
which
he
desired
us
to
wait
for
we
were
kept
waiting
for
this
instrument
some
five
or
six
hours
about
five
in
the
afternoon
we
took
our
departure
with
not
the
most
pleasant
feelings
the
associations
of
the
governor
the
spirit
he
manifested
to
compromise
with
these
scoundrels
the
length
of
time
that
he
had
kept
us
waiting
and
his
general
deportment
together
with
the
infernal
spirit
that
we
saw
exhibited
by
those
whom
he
had
admitted
to
his
counsels
made
the
prospect
anything
but
promising
we
returned
on
horseback
and
arrived
at
nauvoo
i
think
at
about
eight
or
nine
at
night
accompanied
by
captain
yates
in
command
of
a
company
of
mounted
men
who
came
for
the
purpose
of
escorting
joseph
smith
and
the
accused
in
case
of
their
complying
with
the
governor
request
and
going
to
carthage
we
went
directly
to
brother
joseph
when
captain
yates
delivered
to
him
the
communication
a
council
was
called
consisting
of
joseph
brother
hyrum
richards
bernhisel
myself
and
one
or
two
others
we
then
gave
a
detail
of
our
interview
with
the
governor
brother
joseph
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
the
governor
letter
and
with
his
general
deportment
and
so
were
the
council
and
it
became
a
serious
question
as
to
the
course
we
should
pursue
various
projects
were
discussed
but
nothing
definitely
decided
upon
for
some
time
in
the
interim
two
gentlemen
arrived
one
of
them
if
not
both
sons
of
john
calhoun
they
had
come
to
nauvoo
and
were
very
anxious
for
an
interview
with
brother
joseph
these
gentlemen
detained
him
for
some
time
and
as
our
council
was
held
in
bernhisel
room
in
the
mansion
house
the
doctor
lay
down
and
as
it
was
now
between
and
in
the
morning
and
i
had
had
no
rest
on
the
previous
night
i
was
fatigued
and
thinking
that
brother
joseph
might
not
return
i
left
for
home
and
rest
being
very
much
fatigued
i
slept
soundly
and
was
somewhat
surprised
in
the
morning
by
thompson
entering
my
room
about
and
exclaiming
in
surprise
what
you
here
the
brethren
have
crossed
the
rive
some
time
since
what
brethren
i
asked
brother
joseph
and
hyrum
and
brother
richards
she
answered
i
immediately
arose
upon
learning
that
they
had
crossed
the
river
and
did
not
intend
to
go
to
carthage
i
called
together
a
number
of
persons
in
whom
i
had
confidence
and
had
the
type
stereotype
plates
and
most
of
the
valuable
things
removed
from
the
printing
office
believing
that
should
the
governor
and
his
force
come
to
nauvoo
the
first
thing
they
would
do
would
be
to
burn
the
printing
office
for
i
knew
they
would
be
exasperated
if
brother
joseph
went
away
we
had
talked
over
these
matters
the
night
before
but
nothing
was
decided
upon
it
was
brother
joseph
opinion
that
should
we
leave
for
a
time
public
excitement
which
was
then
so
intense
would
be
allayed
that
it
would
throw
on
the
governor
the
responsibility
of
keeping
the
peace
that
in
the
event
of
an
outrage
the
onus
would
rest
upon
the
governor
who
was
amply
prepared
with
troops
and
could
command
all
the
forces
of
the
state
to
preserve
order
and
that
the
act
of
his
own
men
would
be
an
overwhelming
proof
of
their
seditious
designs
not
only
to
the
governor
but
to
the
world
he
moreover
thought
that
in
the
east
where
he
intended
to
go
public
opinion
would
be
set
right
in
relation
to
these
matters
and
its
expression
would
partially
influence
the
west
and
that
after
the
first
ebullition
things
would
assume
a
shape
that
would
justify
his
return
i
made
arrangements
for
crossing
the
river
and
brother
elias
smith
and
joseph
cain
who
were
both
employed
in
the
printing
office
with
me
assisted
all
that
lay
in
their
power
together
with
brother
brower
and
several
hands
in
the
printing
office
as
we
could
not
find
out
the
exact
whereabouts
of
joseph
and
the
brethren
i
crossed
the
river
in
a
boat
furnished
by
brother
cyrus
wheelock
and
alfred
bell
and
after
the
removal
of
the
things
out
of
the
printing
office
joseph
cain
brought
the
account
books
to
me
that
we
might
make
arrangements
for
their
adjustment
and
brother
elias
smith
cousin
to
brother
joseph
went
to
obtain
money
for
the
journey
and
also
to
find
out
and
report
to
me
the
location
of
the
brethren
as
cyrus
wheelock
was
an
active
enterprising
man
and
in
the
event
of
not
finding
brother
joseph
i
calculated
to
go
to
upper
canada
for
the
time
being
and
should
need
a
companion
i
said
to
brother
cyrus
wheelock
can
you
go
with
me
ten
or
fifteen
hundred
miles
he
answered
yes
can
you
start
in
half
an
hour
yes
however
i
told
him
that
he
had
better
see
his
family
who
lived
over
the
river
and
prepare
a
couple
of
horses
and
the
necessary
equipage
for
the
journey
and
that
if
we
did
not
find
brother
joseph
before
we
would
start
at
nightfall
a
laughable
incident
occurred
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
after
making
all
the
preparations
i
could
previous
to
leaving
nauvoo
and
having
bid
adieu
to
my
family
i
went
to
a
house
adjoining
the
river
owned
by
brother
eddy
there
i
disguised
myself
so
as
not
to
be
known
and
so
effectually
was
the
transformation
that
those
who
had
come
after
me
with
a
boat
did
not
know
me
i
went
down
to
the
boat
and
sat
in
it
brother
bell
thinking
it
was
a
stranger
watched
my
moves
for
some
time
very
impatiently
and
then
said
to
brother
wheelock
i
wish
that
old
gentleman
would
go
away
he
has
been
pottering
around
the
boat
for
some
time
and
i
am
afraid
elder
taylor
will
be
coming
when
he
discovered
his
mistake
he
was
not
a
little
amused
i
was
conducted
by
brother
bell
to
a
house
that
was
surrounded
by
timber
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
there
i
spent
several
hours
in
a
chamber
with
brother
joseph
cain
adjusting
my
accounts
and
i
made
arrangements
for
the
stereotype
plates
of
the
book
of
mormon
and
doctrine
and
covenants
to
be
forwarded
east
thinking
to
supply
the
company
with
subsistence
money
through
the
sale
of
these
books
in
the
east
my
horses
were
reported
ready
by
brother
wheelock
and
funds
on
hand
by
brother
elias
smith
in
about
half
an
hour
i
should
have
started
when
brother
elias
smith
came
to
me
with
word
that
he
had
found
the
brethren
that
they
had
concluded
to
go
to
carthage
and
wished
me
to
return
to
nauvoo
and
accompany
them
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
a
good
deal
disappointed
at
this
news
but
i
immediately
made
preparations
to
go
escorted
by
brother
elias
smith
i
and
my
party
went
to
the
neighborhood
of
montrose
where
we
met
brother
joseph
hyrum
brother
richards
and
others
bernhisel
thinks
that
phelps
was
not
with
joseph
and
hyrum
in
the
morning
but
that
he
met
him
myself
joseph
and
hyrum
richards
and
brother
cahoon
in
the
afternoon
near
montrose
returning
to
nauvoo
on
meeting
the
brethren
i
learned
that
it
was
not
brother
desire
to
return
but
that
he
came
back
by
request
of
some
of
the
brethren
and
that
it
coincided
more
with
brother
hyrum
feelings
than
those
of
brother
joseph
in
fact
after
his
return
brother
hyrum
expressed
himself
as
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
course
taken
and
said
he
felt
much
more
at
ease
in
his
mind
than
he
did
before
on
our
return
the
calculation
was
to
throw
ourselves
under
the
immediate
protection
of
the
governor
and
to
trust
to
his
word
and
faith
for
our
preservation
a
message
was
i
believe
sent
to
the
governor
that
night
stating
that
we
should
come
to
carthage
in
the
morning
the
party
that
came
along
with
us
to
escort
us
back
in
case
we
returned
to
carthage
having
returned
it
would
seem
from
the
following
remarks
of
general
ford
that
there
was
a
design
on
foot
which
was
that
if
we
refused
to
go
to
carthage
at
the
governor
request
there
should
be
an
increased
force
called
for
by
the
governor
and
that
we
should
be
destroyed
by
them
in
accordance
with
this
project
captain
yates
returned
with
his
accompanied
by
the
constable
who
held
the
writ
the
following
is
the
governor
remark
in
relation
to
this
affair
the
constable
and
his
escort
returned
the
constable
made
no
effort
to
arrest
any
of
them
nor
would
he
or
the
guard
delay
their
departure
one
minute
beyond
the
time
to
see
whether
an
arrest
could
be
made
upon
their
return
they
reported
that
they
had
been
informed
that
the
accused
had
fled
and
could
not
be
found
i
immediately
proposed
to
a
council
of
officers
to
march
into
nauvoo
with
the
small
force
then
under
my
command
but
the
officers
were
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
too
small
and
many
of
them
insisted
upon
a
further
call
of
the
militia
upon
reflection
i
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
officers
were
right
in
the
estimate
of
our
force
and
the
project
for
immediate
action
was
abandoned
i
was
soon
informed
however
of
the
conduct
of
the
constable
and
guard
and
then
i
was
perfectly
satisfied
that
a
most
base
fraud
had
been
attempted
that
in
fact
it
was
feared
that
the
mormons
would
submit
and
thereby
entitle
themselves
to
the
protection
of
the
law
it
was
very
apparent
that
many
of
the
bustling
active
spirits
were
afraid
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
calling
out
an
overwhelming
militia
force
for
marching
into
nauvoo
for
probable
mutiny
when
there
and
for
the
extermination
of
the
mormon
race
it
appeared
that
the
constable
and
the
escort
were
fully
in
the
secret
and
acted
well
their
part
to
promote
the
conspiracy
in
the
morning
brother
joseph
had
an
interview
with
the
officers
of
the
legion
with
the
leading
members
of
the
city
council
and
with
the
principal
men
of
the
city
the
officers
were
instructed
to
dismiss
their
men
but
to
have
them
in
a
state
of
readiness
to
be
called
upon
in
any
emergency
that
might
occur
about
half
past
six
the
members
of
the
city
council
the
marshal
brothers
joseph
and
hyrum
and
a
number
of
others
started
for
carthage
on
horseback
we
were
instructed
by
brother
joseph
smith
not
to
take
any
arms
and
we
consequently
left
them
behind
we
called
at
the
house
of
brother
fellows
on
our
way
out
brother
fellows
lived
about
four
miles
from
carthage
while
at
brother
fellow
house
captain
dunn
accompanied
by
coolie
one
of
the
governor
came
up
from
carthage
for
nauvoo
with
a
requisition
from
the
governor
for
the
state
arms
we
all
returned
to
nauvoo
with
them
the
governor
request
was
complied
with
and
after
taking
some
refreshments
we
all
returned
to
proceed
to
carthage
we
arrived
there
late
in
the
night
a
great
deal
of
excitement
prevailed
on
and
after
our
arrival
the
governor
had
received
into
his
company
all
of
the
companies
that
had
been
in
the
mob
these
fellows
were
riotous
and
disorderly
hallowing
yelling
and
whooping
about
the
streets
like
indians
many
of
them
intoxicated
the
whole
presented
a
scene
of
rowdyism
and
ruffianism
only
found
among
mobocrats
and
desperadoes
and
entirely
revolting
to
the
best
feelings
of
humanity
the
governor
made
a
speech
to
them
to
the
effect
that
he
would
show
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
to
them
in
the
morning
about
here
the
companies
with
the
governor
were
drawn
up
in
line
and
general
demming
i
think
took
joseph
by
the
arm
and
hyrum
arnold
says
that
joseph
took
the
governor
arm
and
as
he
passed
through
between
the
ranks
the
governor
leading
in
front
very
politely
introduced
them
as
general
joseph
smith
and
general
hyrum
smith
all
were
orderly
and
courteous
except
one
company
of
mobocrats
the
carthage
grays
who
seemed
to
find
fault
on
account
of
too
much
honor
being
paid
to
the
mormons
there
was
afterwards
a
row
between
the
companies
and
they
came
pretty
near
having
a
fight
the
more
orderly
not
feeling
disposed
to
endorse
or
submit
to
the
rowdyism
of
the
mobocrats
the
result
was
that
general
demming
who
was
very
much
of
a
gentleman
ordered
the
carthage
grays
a
company
under
the
command
of
captain
smith
a
magistrate
in
carthage
and
a
most
violent
mobocrat
under
arrest
this
matter
however
was
shortly
afterward
adjusted
and
the
difficulty
settled
between
them
the
mayor
aldermen
councilors
as
well
as
the
marshal
of
the
city
of
nauvoo
together
with
some
persons
who
had
assisted
the
marshal
in
removing
the
press
in
nauvoo
appeared
before
justice
smith
the
aforesaid
captain
and
mobocrat
to
again
answer
the
charge
of
destroying
the
press
but
as
there
was
so
much
excitement
and
as
the
man
was
an
unprincipled
villain
before
whom
we
were
to
have
our
hearing
we
thought
it
most
prudent
to
give
bail
and
consequently
became
security
for
each
other
in
bonds
each
to
appear
before
the
county
court
at
its
next
session
we
had
engaged
as
counsel
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
wood
of
burlington
iowa
and
reed
i
think
of
madison
iowa
after
some
little
discussion
the
bonds
were
signed
and
we
were
all
dismissed
almost
immediately
after
our
dismissal
two
men
augustine
spencer
and
norton
two
worthless
fellows
whose
words
would
not
have
been
taken
for
five
cents
and
the
first
of
whom
had
a
short
time
previously
been
before
the
mayor
in
nauvoo
for
maltreating
a
lame
brother
made
affidavits
that
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
were
guilty
of
treason
and
a
writ
was
accordingly
issued
for
their
arrest
and
the
constable
bettesworth
a
rough
unprincipled
man
wished
immediately
to
hurry
them
away
to
prison
without
any
hearing
his
rude
uncouth
manner
in
the
administration
of
what
he
considered
the
duties
of
his
office
made
him
exceedingly
repulsive
to
us
all
but
independent
of
these
acts
the
proceedings
in
this
case
were
altogether
illegal
providing
the
court
was
sincere
which
it
was
not
and
providing
these
men
oaths
were
true
and
that
joseph
and
hyrum
were
guilty
of
treason
still
the
whole
course
was
illegal
the
magistrate
made
out
a
mittimus
and
committed
them
to
prison
without
a
hearing
which
he
had
no
right
legally
to
do
the
statue
of
illinois
expressly
provides
that
all
men
shall
have
a
hearing
before
a
magistrate
before
they
shall
be
committed
to
prison
and
robert
smith
the
magistrate
had
made
out
a
mittimus
committing
them
to
prison
contrary
to
law
without
such
hearing
as
i
was
informed
of
this
illegal
proceeding
i
went
immediately
to
the
governor
and
informed
him
of
it
whether
he
was
apprised
of
it
before
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
my
opinion
is
that
he
was
i
represented
to
him
the
characters
of
the
parties
who
had
made
oath
the
outrageous
nature
of
the
charge
the
indignity
offered
to
men
in
the
position
which
they
occupied
and
declared
to
him
that
he
knew
very
well
it
was
a
vexatious
proceeding
and
that
the
accused
were
not
guilty
of
any
such
crime
the
governor
replied
he
was
very
sorry
that
the
thing
had
occurred
that
he
did
not
believe
the
charges
but
that
he
thought
the
best
thing
to
be
done
was
to
let
the
law
take
its
course
i
then
reminded
him
that
we
had
come
out
there
at
his
instance
not
to
satisfy
the
law
which
we
had
done
before
but
the
prejudices
of
the
people
in
relation
to
the
affairs
of
the
press
that
at
his
instance
we
had
given
bonds
which
we
could
not
by
law
be
required
to
do
to
satisfy
the
people
and
that
it
was
asking
too
much
to
require
gentlemen
in
their
position
in
life
to
suffer
the
degradation
of
being
immured
in
a
jail
at
the
instance
of
such
worthless
scoundrels
as
those
who
had
made
this
affidavit
the
governor
replied
that
it
was
an
unpleasant
affair
and
looked
hard
but
that
it
was
a
matter
over
which
he
had
no
control
as
it
belonged
to
the
judiciary
that
he
as
the
executive
could
not
interfere
with
their
proceedings
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
they
would
immediately
be
dismissed
i
told
him
that
we
had
looked
to
him
for
protection
from
such
insults
and
that
i
thought
we
had
a
right
to
do
so
from
the
solemn
promises
which
he
had
made
to
me
and
to
bernhisel
in
relation
to
our
coming
without
guard
or
arms
that
we
had
relied
upon
his
faith
and
had
a
right
to
expect
him
to
fulfill
his
engagements
after
we
had
placed
ourselves
implicity
under
his
care
and
complied
with
all
his
requests
although
extrajudicial
he
replied
that
he
would
detail
a
guard
if
we
required
it
and
see
us
protected
but
that
he
could
not
interfere
with
the
judiciary
i
expressed
my
dissatisfaction
at
the
course
taken
and
told
him
that
if
we
were
to
be
subject
to
mob
rule
and
to
be
dragged
contrary
to
law
into
prison
at
the
instance
of
every
infernal
scoundrel
whose
oaths
could
be
bought
for
a
dram
of
whiskey
his
protection
availed
very
little
and
we
had
miscalculated
his
promises
seeing
there
was
no
prospect
of
redress
from
the
governor
i
returned
to
the
room
and
found
the
constable
bettesworth
very
urgent
to
hurry
brothers
joseph
and
hyrum
to
prison
while
the
brethren
were
remonstrating
with
him
at
the
same
time
a
great
rabble
was
gathered
in
the
streets
and
around
the
door
and
from
the
rowdyism
manifested
i
was
afraid
there
was
a
design
to
murder
the
prisoners
on
the
way
to
jail
without
conferring
with
any
person
my
next
feelings
were
to
procure
a
guard
and
seeing
a
man
habited
as
a
soldier
in
the
room
i
went
to
him
and
said
i
am
afraid
there
is
a
design
against
the
lives
of
the
smith
will
you
go
immediately
and
bring
your
captain
and
if
not
convenient
any
other
captain
of
a
company
and
i
will
pay
you
well
for
your
trouble
he
said
he
would
and
departed
forthwith
and
soon
returned
with
his
captain
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
introduced
him
to
me
i
told
him
of
my
fears
and
requested
him
immediately
to
fetch
his
company
he
departed
forthwith
and
arrived
at
the
door
with
them
just
at
the
time
when
the
constable
was
hurrying
the
brethren
down
stairs
a
number
of
the
brethren
went
along
together
with
one
or
two
strangers
and
all
of
us
safely
lodged
in
prison
remained
there
during
the
night
at
the
request
of
joseph
smith
for
an
interview
with
the
governor
he
came
the
next
morning
thursday
june
at
half
past
accompanied
by
colonel
geddes
when
a
lengthy
conversation
was
entered
into
in
relation
to
the
existing
difficulties
and
after
some
preliminary
remarks
at
the
governor
request
brother
joseph
gave
him
a
general
outline
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
relation
to
our
difficulties
the
excited
state
of
the
country
the
tumultuous
mobocratic
movements
of
our
enemies
the
precautionary
measures
used
by
himself
joseph
smith
the
acts
of
the
city
council
the
destruction
of
the
press
and
the
moves
of
the
mob
and
ourselves
up
to
that
time
the
following
report
is
i
believe
substantially
correct
general
smith
i
believe
you
have
given
me
a
general
outline
of
the
difficulties
that
have
existed
in
the
country
in
the
documents
forwarded
to
me
by
bernhisel
and
taylor
but
unfortunately
there
seems
to
be
a
great
discrepancy
between
your
statements
and
those
of
your
enemies
it
is
true
that
you
are
substantiated
by
evidence
and
affidavit
but
for
such
an
extraordinary
excitement
as
that
which
is
now
in
the
country
there
must
be
some
cause
and
i
attribute
the
last
outbreak
to
the
destruction
of
the
and
to
your
refusal
to
comply
with
the
writ
issued
by
esquire
morrison
the
press
in
the
united
states
is
looked
upon
as
the
great
bulwark
of
american
freedom
and
its
destruction
in
nauvoo
was
represented
and
looked
upon
as
a
measure
and
manifests
to
the
people
a
disposition
on
your
part
to
suppress
the
liberty
of
speech
and
of
the
press
this
with
your
refusal
to
comply
with
the
requisition
of
a
writ
i
conceive
to
be
the
principal
cause
of
this
difficulty
and
you
are
moreover
represented
to
me
as
turbulent
and
defiant
of
the
laws
and
institutions
of
your
country
governor
ford
you
sir
as
governor
of
this
state
are
aware
of
the
persecutions
that
i
have
endured
you
know
well
that
our
course
has
been
peaceable
and
for
i
have
furnished
this
state
ever
since
our
settlement
here
with
sufficient
evidence
of
my
pacific
intentions
and
those
of
the
people
with
whom
i
am
associated
by
the
endurance
of
every
conceivable
indignity
and
lawless
outrage
perpetrated
upon
me
and
upon
this
people
since
our
settlement
here
and
you
know
yourself
that
i
have
kept
you
well
posted
in
relation
to
all
matters
associated
with
the
late
difficulties
if
you
have
not
got
some
of
my
communications
it
has
not
been
my
fault
agreeably
to
your
orders
i
assembled
the
nauvoo
legion
for
the
protection
of
nauvoo
and
the
surrounding
country
against
an
armed
band
of
marauders
and
ever
since
they
have
been
mustered
i
have
almost
daily
communicated
with
you
in
regard
to
all
the
leading
events
that
have
transpired
and
whether
in
the
capacity
of
mayor
of
the
city
or
lieutenant
general
of
the
nauvoo
legion
i
have
striven
according
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
to
preserve
the
peace
and
to
administer
justice
but
my
motives
are
impugned
my
acts
are
misconstrued
and
i
am
grossly
and
wickedly
misrepresented
i
suppose
i
am
indebted
for
my
incarceration
to
the
oath
of
a
worthless
man
who
was
arraigned
before
me
and
fined
for
abusing
and
maltreating
his
lame
helpless
brother
that
i
should
be
charged
by
you
sir
who
know
better
of
acting
contrary
to
law
is
to
me
a
matter
of
surprise
was
it
the
mormons
or
our
enemies
who
first
commenced
these
difficulties
you
know
well
it
was
not
us
and
when
this
turbulent
outrageous
people
commenced
their
insurrectionary
movements
i
made
you
acquainted
with
them
officially
and
asked
your
advice
and
have
followed
strictly
your
counsel
in
every
particular
who
ordered
out
the
nauvoo
legion
i
did
under
your
direction
for
what
purpose
to
suppress
the
insurrectionary
movements
it
was
at
your
instance
sir
that
i
issued
a
proclamation
calling
upon
the
nauvoo
legion
to
be
in
readiness
at
a
moment
warning
to
guard
against
the
incursions
of
mobs
and
gave
an
order
to
jonathan
dunham
acting
to
that
effect
am
i
then
to
be
charged
with
the
acts
of
others
and
because
lawlessness
and
mobocracy
abound
am
i
when
carrying
out
your
instructions
to
be
charged
with
not
abiding
law
why
is
it
that
i
must
be
made
accountable
for
other
men
acts
if
there
is
trouble
in
the
country
neither
i
nor
my
people
made
it
and
all
that
we
have
ever
done
after
much
endurance
on
our
part
is
to
maintain
and
uphold
the
constitution
and
institutions
of
our
country
and
to
protect
an
injured
innocent
and
persecuted
people
against
misrule
and
mob
violence
concerning
the
destruction
of
the
press
to
which
you
refer
men
may
differ
somewhat
in
their
opinions
about
it
but
can
it
be
supposed
that
after
all
the
indignities
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
outside
that
people
could
suffer
a
set
of
worthless
vagabonds
to
come
into
their
city
and
right
under
their
own
eyes
and
protection
vilify
and
calumniate
not
only
themselves
but
the
character
of
their
wives
and
daughters
as
was
impudently
and
unblushingly
done
in
that
infamous
and
filthy
sheet
there
is
not
a
city
in
the
united
states
that
would
have
suffered
such
an
indignity
for
hours
our
whole
people
were
indignant
and
loudly
called
upon
our
city
authorities
for
a
redress
of
their
grievances
which
if
not
attended
to
they
themselves
would
have
taken
into
their
own
hands
and
have
summarily
punished
the
audacious
wretches
as
they
deserved
the
principle
of
equal
rights
that
has
been
instilled
into
our
bosoms
from
our
cradles
as
american
citizens
forbids
us
submitting
to
every
foul
indignity
and
succumbing
and
pandering
to
wretches
so
infamous
as
these
but
independent
of
this
the
course
that
we
pursued
we
consider
to
be
strictly
legal
for
notwithstanding
the
result
we
were
anxious
to
be
governed
strictly
by
law
and
therefore
we
convened
the
city
council
and
being
desirous
in
our
deliberations
to
abide
by
law
we
summoned
legal
counsel
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
upon
investigating
the
matter
we
found
that
our
city
charter
gave
us
power
to
remove
all
nuisances
furthermore
after
consulting
blackstone
upon
what
might
be
considered
a
nuisance
it
appeared
that
that
distinguished
lawyer
who
is
considered
authority
i
believe
in
all
our
courts
states
among
other
things
that
libelous
and
filthy
press
may
be
considered
a
nuisance
and
abated
as
such
here
then
one
of
the
most
eminent
english
barristers
whose
works
are
considered
standard
with
us
declares
that
a
libelous
and
filthy
press
may
be
considered
a
nuisance
and
our
own
charter
given
us
by
the
legislature
of
this
state
gives
us
power
to
remove
nuisances
and
by
ordering
that
press
to
be
abated
as
a
nuisance
we
conceived
that
we
were
acting
strictly
in
accordance
with
law
we
made
that
order
in
our
corporate
capacity
and
the
city
marshal
carried
it
out
it
is
possible
there
may
have
been
some
better
way
but
i
must
confess
that
i
could
not
see
it
in
relation
to
the
writ
served
upon
us
we
are
willing
to
abide
the
consequences
of
our
own
acts
but
are
unwilling
in
answering
a
writ
of
that
kind
to
submit
to
illegal
exactions
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
us
under
the
pretense
of
law
when
we
knew
they
were
in
open
violation
of
it
when
that
document
was
presented
to
me
by
bettesworth
i
offered
in
the
presence
of
more
than
twenty
persons
to
go
to
any
other
magistrate
either
in
our
city
in
appanoose
or
any
other
place
where
we
should
be
safe
but
we
all
refused
to
put
ourselves
into
the
power
of
a
mob
what
right
had
that
constable
to
refuse
our
request
he
had
none
according
to
law
for
you
know
governor
ford
that
the
statute
law
in
illinois
is
that
the
parties
served
with
the
writ
go
before
him
who
issued
it
or
some
other
justice
of
the
peace
why
then
should
we
be
dragged
to
carthage
where
the
law
does
not
compel
us
to
go
does
not
this
look
like
many
others
of
our
persecutions
with
which
you
are
acquainted
and
have
we
not
a
right
to
expect
foul
play
this
very
act
was
a
breach
of
law
on
his
part
an
assumption
of
power
that
did
not
belong
to
him
and
an
attempt
at
least
to
deprive
us
of
our
legal
and
constitutional
rights
and
privileges
what
could
we
do
under
the
circumstances
different
from
what
we
did
do
we
sued
for
and
obtained
a
writ
of
from
the
municipal
court
by
which
we
were
delivered
from
the
hands
of
constable
bettesworth
and
brought
before
and
acquitted
by
the
municipal
court
after
our
acquittal
in
a
conversation
with
judge
thomas
although
he
considered
the
acts
of
the
party
illegal
he
advised
that
to
satisfy
the
people
we
had
better
go
before
another
magistrate
who
was
not
in
our
church
in
accordance
with
his
advice
we
went
before
esquire
wells
with
whom
you
are
well
acquainted
both
parties
were
present
witnesses
were
called
on
both
sides
the
case
was
fully
investigated
and
we
were
again
dismissed
and
what
is
this
pretended
desire
to
enforce
law
and
wherefore
are
these
lying
base
rumors
put
into
circulation
but
to
seek
through
mob
influence
under
pretense
of
law
to
make
us
submit
to
requisitions
which
are
contrary
to
law
and
subversive
of
every
principle
of
justice
and
when
you
sir
required
us
to
come
out
here
we
came
not
because
it
was
legal
but
because
you
required
it
of
us
and
we
were
desirous
of
showing
to
you
and
to
all
men
that
we
shrunk
not
from
the
most
rigid
investigation
of
our
acts
we
certainly
did
expect
other
treatment
than
to
be
immured
in
a
jail
at
the
instance
of
these
men
and
i
think
from
your
plighted
faith
we
had
a
right
so
to
expect
after
disbanding
our
own
forces
and
putting
ourselves
entirely
in
your
hands
and
now
after
having
fulfilled
my
part
sir
as
a
man
and
an
american
citizen
i
call
upon
you
governor
ford
to
deliver
us
from
this
place
and
rescue
us
from
this
outrage
that
is
sought
to
be
practiced
upon
us
by
a
set
of
infamous
scoundrels
but
you
have
placed
men
under
arrest
detained
men
as
prisoners
and
given
passes
to
others
some
of
which
i
have
seen
greene
city
perhaps
i
can
explain
since
these
difficulties
have
commenced
you
are
aware
that
we
have
been
placed
under
very
peculiar
circumstances
our
city
has
been
placed
under
a
very
rigid
police
guard
in
addition
to
this
frequent
guards
have
been
placed
outside
the
city
to
prevent
any
sudden
surprise
and
those
guards
have
questioned
suspected
or
suspicious
persons
as
to
their
business
to
strangers
in
some
instances
passes
have
been
given
to
prevent
difficulty
in
passing
those
guards
it
is
some
of
these
passes
that
you
have
seen
no
person
sir
has
been
imprisoned
without
a
legal
cause
in
our
city
why
did
you
not
give
a
more
speedy
answer
to
the
posse
that
i
sent
out
we
had
matters
of
importance
to
consult
upon
your
letter
showed
anything
but
an
amiable
spirit
we
have
suffered
immensely
in
missouri
from
mobs
in
loss
of
property
imprisonment
and
otherwise
it
took
some
time
for
us
to
weigh
duly
these
matters
we
could
not
decide
upon
matters
of
such
importance
immediately
and
your
posse
were
too
hasty
in
returning
we
were
consulting
for
a
large
people
and
vast
interests
were
at
stake
we
had
been
outrageously
imposed
upon
and
knew
not
how
far
we
could
trust
any
one
besides
a
question
necessarily
arose
how
shall
we
come
your
request
was
that
we
should
come
unarmed
it
became
a
matter
of
serious
importance
to
decide
how
far
promises
could
be
trusted
and
how
far
we
were
safe
from
mob
violence
it
certainly
did
look
from
all
i
have
heard
from
the
general
spirit
of
violence
and
mobocracy
that
here
prevails
that
it
was
not
safe
for
you
to
come
unprotected
i
think
that
sufficient
time
was
not
allowed
by
the
posse
for
you
to
consult
and
get
ready
they
were
too
hasty
but
i
suppose
they
found
themselves
bound
by
their
orders
i
think
too
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
say
and
your
reasoning
is
plausible
but
i
must
beg
leave
to
differ
from
you
in
relation
to
the
acts
of
the
city
council
that
council
in
my
opinion
had
no
right
to
act
in
a
legislative
capacity
and
in
that
of
the
judiciary
they
should
have
passed
a
law
in
relation
to
the
matter
and
then
the
municipal
court
upon
complaint
could
have
removed
it
but
for
the
city
council
to
take
upon
themselves
the
and
the
execution
of
the
law
is
in
my
opinion
wrong
besides
these
men
ought
to
have
had
a
hearing
before
their
property
was
destroyed
to
destroy
it
without
was
an
infringement
on
their
rights
besides
it
is
so
contrary
to
the
feelings
of
american
people
to
interfere
with
the
press
and
furthermore
i
can
not
but
think
that
it
would
have
been
more
judicious
for
you
to
have
gone
with
bettesworth
to
carthage
notwithstanding
the
law
did
not
require
it
concerning
your
being
in
jail
i
am
sorry
for
that
i
wish
it
had
been
otherwise
i
hope
you
will
soon
be
released
but
i
can
not
interfere
governor
ford
allow
me
sir
to
bring
one
thing
to
your
mind
that
you
seem
to
have
overlooked
you
state
that
you
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
to
have
submitted
to
the
requisition
of
constable
bettesworth
and
to
have
gone
to
carthage
do
you
not
know
sir
that
that
writ
was
served
at
the
instance
of
an
mob
who
had
passed
resolutions
and
published
them
to
the
effect
that
they
would
exterminate
the
mormon
leaders
and
are
you
not
informed
that
captain
anderson
was
not
only
threatened
but
had
a
gun
fired
at
his
boat
by
this
said
mob
in
warsaw
when
coming
up
to
nauvoo
and
that
this
very
thing
was
made
use
of
as
a
means
to
get
us
into
their
hands
and
we
could
not
without
taking
an
armed
force
with
us
go
there
without
according
to
their
published
declarations
going
into
the
jaws
of
death
to
have
taken
a
force
with
us
would
only
have
fanned
the
excitement
and
they
would
have
stated
that
we
wanted
to
use
intimidation
therefore
we
thought
it
the
most
judicious
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
protection
of
the
law
i
see
i
see
furthermore
in
relation
to
the
press
you
say
that
you
differ
from
me
in
opinion
be
it
so
the
thing
after
all
is
only
a
legal
difficulty
and
the
courts
i
should
judge
are
competent
to
decide
on
that
matter
if
our
act
was
illegal
we
are
willing
to
meet
it
and
although
i
can
not
see
the
distinction
that
you
draw
about
the
acts
of
the
city
council
and
what
difference
it
could
have
made
in
point
of
fact
law
or
justice
between
the
city
council
acting
together
or
separate
or
how
much
more
legal
it
would
have
been
for
the
municipal
court
who
were
a
part
of
the
city
council
to
act
separately
instead
of
with
the
councilors
yet
if
it
is
deemed
that
we
did
a
wrong
in
destroying
that
press
we
refuse
not
to
pay
for
it
we
are
desirous
to
fulfill
the
law
in
every
particular
and
are
responsible
for
our
acts
you
say
that
the
parties
ought
to
have
a
hearing
had
it
been
a
civil
suit
this
of
course
would
have
been
proper
but
there
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
every
principle
of
right
a
nuisance
and
it
was
abated
on
the
same
principle
that
any
nuisance
stench
or
putrefied
carcass
would
have
been
removed
our
first
step
therefore
was
to
stop
the
foul
noisome
filthy
sheet
and
then
the
next
in
our
opinion
would
have
been
to
have
prosecuted
the
man
for
a
breach
of
public
decency
and
furthermore
again
let
me
say
governor
ford
i
shall
look
to
you
for
our
protection
i
believe
you
are
talking
of
going
to
nauvoo
if
you
go
sir
i
wish
to
go
along
i
refuse
not
to
answer
any
law
but
i
do
not
consider
myself
safe
here
i
am
in
hopes
that
you
will
be
acquitted
and
if
i
go
i
will
certainly
take
you
along
i
do
not
however
apprehend
danger
i
think
you
are
perfectly
safe
either
here
or
anywhere
else
i
can
not
however
interfere
with
the
law
i
am
placed
in
peculiar
circumstances
and
seem
to
be
blamed
by
all
parties
governor
ford
i
ask
nothing
but
what
is
legal
i
have
a
right
to
expect
protection
at
least
from
you
for
independent
of
law
you
have
pledged
your
faith
and
that
of
the
state
for
my
protection
and
i
wish
to
go
to
nauvoo
and
you
shall
have
protection
general
smith
i
did
not
make
this
promise
without
consulting
my
officers
who
all
pledged
their
honor
to
its
fulfillment
i
do
not
know
that
i
shall
go
tomorrow
to
nauvoo
but
if
i
do
i
will
take
you
along
at
a
quarter
past
ten
the
governor
left
at
about
half
past
twelve
reed
one
of
joseph
counsel
came
in
apparently
much
elated
he
stated
that
upon
an
examination
of
the
law
he
found
that
the
magistrate
had
transcended
his
jurisdiction
and
that
having
committed
them
without
an
examination
his
jurisdiction
ended
that
he
had
him
upon
a
pin
hook
that
he
ought
to
have
examined
them
before
he
committed
them
and
that
having
violated
the
law
in
this
particular
he
had
no
further
power
over
them
for
once
committed
they
were
out
of
his
jurisdiction
as
the
power
of
the
magistrate
extended
no
farther
than
their
committal
and
that
now
they
could
not
be
brought
out
except
at
the
regular
session
of
the
circuit
court
or
by
a
writ
of
corpus
but
that
if
justice
smith
would
consent
to
go
to
nauvoo
for
trial
he
would
compromise
matters
with
him
and
overlook
this
matter
reed
further
stated
that
the
or
mob
had
concocted
a
scheme
to
get
out
a
writ
from
missouri
with
a
demand
upon
governor
ford
for
the
arrest
of
joseph
smith
and
his
conveyance
to
missouri
and
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
wilson
had
returned
from
missouri
the
night
before
the
burning
of
the
press
for
this
purpose
at
half
past
two
constable
bettesworth
came
to
the
jail
with
a
man
named
simpson
professing
to
have
some
order
but
he
would
not
send
up
his
name
and
the
guard
would
not
let
him
pass
bernhisel
and
brother
wasson
went
to
inform
the
governor
and
council
of
this
at
about
twenty
minutes
to
three
bernhisel
returned
and
stated
that
he
thought
the
governor
was
doing
all
he
could
at
about
ten
minutes
to
three
hyrum
kimball
appeared
with
news
from
nauvoo
soon
after
constable
bettesworth
came
with
an
order
from
esquire
smith
to
convey
the
prisoners
to
the
for
trial
he
was
informed
that
the
process
was
illegal
that
they
had
been
placed
there
contrary
to
law
and
that
they
refused
to
come
unless
by
legal
process
i
was
informed
that
justice
smith
who
was
also
captain
of
the
carthage
grays
went
to
the
governor
and
informed
him
of
the
matter
and
that
the
governor
replied
you
have
your
forces
and
of
course
can
use
them
the
constable
certainly
did
return
accompanied
by
a
guard
of
armed
men
and
by
force
and
under
protest
hurried
the
prisoners
to
the
court
about
four
the
case
was
called
by
captain
robert
smith
the
counsel
for
the
prisoners
called
for
subpoenas
to
bring
witnesses
at
minutes
past
four
he
took
a
copy
of
the
order
to
bring
the
prisoners
from
jail
to
trial
and
afterwards
he
took
names
of
witnesses
counsel
present
for
the
state
higbee
skinner
sharp
emmons
and
morrison
minutes
to
five
the
writ
was
returned
as
served
june
many
remarks
were
made
at
the
court
that
i
paid
but
little
attention
to
as
i
considered
the
whole
thing
illegal
and
a
complete
burlesque
wood
objected
to
the
proceedings
in
total
in
consequence
of
its
illegality
showing
that
the
prisoners
were
not
only
illegally
committed
but
that
being
once
committed
the
magistrate
had
no
further
power
over
them
but
as
it
was
the
same
magistrate
before
whom
he
was
pleading
who
imprisoned
them
contrary
to
law
and
the
same
who
as
captain
forced
them
from
jail
his
arguments
availed
but
little
he
then
urged
that
the
prisoners
be
remanded
until
witnesses
could
be
had
and
applied
for
a
continuance
for
that
purpose
skinner
suggested
until
twelve
next
day
wood
again
demanded
until
witnesses
could
be
obtained
that
the
court
meet
at
a
specified
time
and
that
if
witnesses
were
not
present
again
adjourn
without
calling
the
prisoners
after
various
remarks
from
reed
skinner
and
others
the
court
stated
that
the
writ
was
served
yesterday
and
that
it
will
give
until
tomorrow
at
twelve
to
get
witnesses
we
then
returned
to
jail
immediately
after
our
return
bernhisel
went
to
the
governor
and
obtained
from
him
an
order
for
us
to
occupy
a
large
open
room
containing
a
bedstead
i
rather
think
that
the
same
room
had
been
appropriated
to
the
use
of
debtors
at
any
rate
there
was
free
access
to
the
jailer
house
and
no
bars
or
locks
except
such
as
might
be
on
the
outside
door
of
the
jail
the
jailer
george
steghall
and
his
wife
manifested
a
disposition
to
make
us
as
comfortable
as
they
could
we
ate
at
their
table
which
was
well
provided
and
of
course
paid
for
it
i
do
not
remember
the
names
of
all
who
were
with
us
that
night
and
the
next
morning
in
jail
for
several
went
and
came
among
those
that
we
considered
stationery
were
stephen
markham
john
fullmer
captain
dan
jones
willard
richards
and
myself
bernhisel
says
that
he
was
there
from
wednesday
in
the
afternoon
until
eleven
next
day
we
were
however
visited
by
numerous
friends
among
whom
were
uncle
john
smith
hyrum
kimball
cyrus
wheelock
besides
lawyers
as
counsel
there
was
also
a
great
variety
of
conversation
which
was
rather
desultory
than
otherwise
and
referred
to
circumstances
that
had
transpired
our
former
and
present
grievances
the
spirit
of
the
troops
around
us
and
the
disposition
of
the
governor
the
devising
for
legal
and
other
plans
for
deliverance
the
nature
of
testimony
required
the
gathering
of
proper
witnesses
and
a
variety
of
other
topics
including
our
religious
hopes
etc
during
one
of
these
conversations
richards
remarked
brother
joseph
if
it
is
necessary
that
you
die
in
this
matter
and
if
they
will
take
me
in
your
stead
i
will
suffer
for
you
at
another
time
when
conversing
about
deliverance
i
said
brother
joseph
if
you
will
permit
it
and
say
the
word
i
will
have
you
out
of
this
prison
in
five
hours
if
the
jail
has
to
come
down
to
do
it
my
idea
was
to
go
to
nauvoo
and
collect
a
force
sufficient
as
i
considered
the
whole
affair
a
legal
farce
and
a
flagrant
outrage
upon
our
liberty
and
rights
brother
joseph
refused
elder
cyrus
wheelock
came
in
to
see
us
and
when
he
was
about
leaving
drew
a
small
pistol
a
from
his
pocket
remarking
at
the
same
time
would
any
of
you
like
to
have
this
brother
joseph
immediately
replied
yes
give
it
to
me
whereupon
he
took
the
pistol
and
put
it
in
his
pantaloons
pocket
the
pistol
was
a
revolver
of
allen
patent
it
belonged
to
me
and
was
one
that
i
furnished
to
brother
wheelock
when
he
talked
of
going
with
me
to
the
east
previous
to
our
coming
to
carthage
i
have
it
now
in
my
possession
brother
wheelock
went
out
on
some
errand
and
was
not
suffered
to
return
the
report
of
the
governor
having
gone
to
nauvoo
without
taking
the
prisoners
along
with
him
caused
very
unpleasant
feelings
as
we
were
apprised
that
we
were
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
carthage
grays
a
company
strictly
mobocratic
and
whom
we
knew
to
be
our
most
deadly
enemies
and
their
captain
esquire
smith
was
a
most
unprincipled
villain
besides
this
all
the
mob
forces
comprising
the
governor
troops
were
dismissed
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
companies
which
the
governor
took
with
him
to
nauvoo
the
great
part
of
the
mob
was
liberated
the
remainder
was
our
guard
we
looked
upon
it
not
only
as
a
breach
of
faith
on
the
part
of
the
governor
but
also
as
an
indication
of
a
desire
to
insult
us
if
nothing
more
by
leaving
us
in
the
proximity
of
such
men
the
prevention
of
wheelock
return
was
among
the
first
of
their
hostile
movements
colonel
markham
then
went
out
and
he
was
also
prevented
from
returning
he
was
very
angry
at
this
but
the
mob
paid
no
attention
to
him
they
drove
him
out
of
town
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
threatened
to
shoot
him
if
he
returned
he
went
i
am
informed
to
nauvoo
for
the
purpose
of
raising
a
company
of
men
for
our
protection
brother
fullmer
went
to
nauvoo
after
witnesses
it
is
my
opinion
that
brother
wheelock
did
also
some
time
after
dinner
we
sent
for
some
wine
it
has
been
reported
by
some
that
this
was
taken
as
a
sacrament
it
was
no
such
thing
our
spirits
were
generally
dull
and
heavy
and
it
was
sent
for
to
revive
us
i
think
it
was
captain
jones
who
went
after
it
but
they
would
not
suffer
him
to
return
i
believe
we
all
drank
of
the
wine
and
gave
some
to
one
or
two
of
the
prison
guards
we
all
of
us
felt
unusually
dull
and
languid
with
a
remarkable
depression
of
spirits
in
consonance
with
those
feelings
i
sang
a
song
that
had
lately
been
introduced
into
nauvoo
entitled
a
poor
wayfaring
man
of
grief
etc
the
song
is
pathetic
and
the
tune
quite
plaintive
and
was
very
much
in
accordance
with
our
feelings
at
the
time
for
our
spirits
were
all
depressed
dull
and
gloomy
and
surcharged
with
indefinite
ominous
forebodings
after
a
lapse
of
some
time
brother
hyrum
requested
me
again
to
sing
that
song
i
replied
brother
hyrum
i
do
not
feel
like
singing
when
he
remarked
oh
never
mind
commence
singing
and
you
will
get
the
spirit
of
it
at
his
request
i
did
so
soon
afterwards
i
was
sitting
at
one
of
the
front
windows
of
the
jail
when
i
saw
a
number
of
men
with
painted
faces
coming
around
the
corner
of
the
jail
and
aiming
towards
the
stairs
the
other
brethren
had
seen
the
same
for
as
i
went
to
the
door
i
found
brother
hyrum
smith
and
richards
already
leaning
against
it
they
both
pressed
against
the
door
with
their
shoulders
to
prevent
its
being
opened
as
the
lock
and
latch
were
comparatively
useless
while
in
this
position
the
mob
who
had
come
up
stairs
and
tried
to
open
the
door
probably
thought
it
was
locked
and
fired
a
ball
through
the
keyhole
at
this
richards
and
brother
hyrum
leaped
back
from
the
door
with
their
faces
towards
it
almost
instantly
another
ball
passed
through
the
panel
of
the
door
and
struck
brother
hyrum
on
the
left
side
of
the
nose
entering
his
face
and
head
at
the
same
instant
another
ball
from
the
outside
entered
his
back
passing
through
his
body
and
striking
his
watch
the
ball
came
from
the
back
through
the
jail
window
opposite
the
door
and
must
from
its
range
have
been
fired
from
the
carthage
grays
who
were
placed
there
ostensibly
for
our
protection
as
the
balls
from
the
shot
close
by
the
jail
would
have
entered
the
ceiling
we
being
in
the
second
story
and
there
never
was
a
time
after
that
when
hyrum
could
have
received
the
latter
wound
immediately
when
the
balls
struck
him
he
fell
flat
on
his
back
crying
as
he
fell
i
am
a
dead
man
he
never
moved
afterwards
i
shall
never
forget
the
deep
feeling
of
sympathy
and
regard
manifested
in
the
countenance
of
brother
joseph
as
he
drew
nigh
to
hyrum
and
leaning
over
him
exclaimed
oh
my
poor
dear
brother
hyrum
he
however
instantly
arose
and
with
a
firm
quick
step
and
a
determined
expression
of
countenance
approached
the
door
and
pulling
the
left
by
brother
wheelock
from
his
pocket
opened
the
door
slightly
and
snapped
the
pistol
six
successive
times
only
three
of
the
barrels
however
were
discharged
i
afterwards
understood
that
two
or
three
were
wounded
by
these
discharges
two
of
whom
i
am
informed
died
i
had
in
my
hands
a
large
strong
hickory
stick
brought
there
by
brother
markham
and
left
by
him
which
i
had
seized
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
mob
approach
and
while
brother
joseph
was
firing
the
pistol
i
stood
close
behind
him
as
soon
as
he
had
discharged
it
he
stepped
back
and
i
immediately
took
his
place
next
to
the
door
while
he
occupied
the
one
i
had
done
while
he
was
shooting
brother
richards
at
this
time
had
a
knotty
in
his
hands
belonging
to
me
and
stood
next
to
brother
joseph
a
little
farther
from
the
door
in
an
oblique
direction
apparently
to
avoid
the
rake
of
the
fire
from
the
door
the
firing
of
bother
joseph
made
our
assailants
pause
for
a
moment
very
soon
after
however
they
pushed
the
door
some
distance
open
and
protruded
and
discharged
their
guns
into
the
room
when
i
parried
them
off
with
my
stick
giving
another
direction
to
the
balls
it
certainly
was
a
terrible
scene
streams
of
fire
as
thick
as
my
arm
passed
by
me
as
these
men
fired
and
unarmed
as
we
were
it
looked
like
certain
death
i
remember
feeling
as
though
my
time
had
come
but
i
do
not
know
when
in
any
critical
position
i
was
more
calm
unruffled
energetic
and
acted
with
more
promptness
and
decision
it
certainly
was
far
from
pleasant
to
be
so
near
the
muzzles
of
those
as
they
belched
forth
their
liquid
flames
and
deadly
balls
while
i
was
engaged
in
parrying
the
guns
brother
joseph
said
right
brother
taylor
parry
them
off
as
well
as
you
can
these
were
the
last
words
i
ever
heard
him
speak
on
earth
every
moment
the
crowd
at
the
door
became
more
dense
as
they
were
unquestionably
pressed
on
by
those
in
the
rear
ascending
the
stairs
until
the
whole
entrance
at
the
door
was
literally
crowded
with
muskets
and
rifles
which
with
the
swearing
shouting
and
demoniacal
expressions
of
those
outside
the
door
and
on
the
stairs
and
the
firing
of
the
guns
mingled
with
their
horrid
oaths
and
execrations
made
it
look
like
pandemonium
let
loose
and
was
indeed
a
fit
representation
of
the
horrid
deed
in
which
they
were
engaged
after
parrying
the
guns
for
some
time
which
now
protruded
thicker
and
farther
into
the
room
and
seeing
no
hope
of
escape
or
protection
there
as
we
were
now
unarmed
it
occurred
to
me
that
we
might
have
some
friends
outside
and
that
there
might
be
some
chance
of
escape
in
that
direction
but
here
there
seemed
to
be
none
as
i
expected
them
every
moment
to
rush
into
the
room
nothing
but
extreme
cowardice
having
thus
far
kept
them
out
as
the
tumult
and
pressure
increased
without
any
other
hope
i
made
a
spring
for
the
window
which
was
right
in
front
of
the
jail
door
where
the
mob
was
standing
and
also
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
carthage
grays
who
were
stationed
some
ten
or
twelve
rods
off
the
weather
was
hot
we
all
of
us
had
our
coats
off
and
the
window
was
raised
to
admit
air
as
i
reached
the
window
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaping
out
i
was
struck
by
a
ball
from
the
door
about
midway
of
my
thigh
which
struck
the
bone
and
flattened
out
almost
to
the
size
of
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
and
then
passed
on
through
the
fleshy
part
to
within
about
half
an
inch
of
the
outside
i
think
some
prominent
nerve
must
have
been
severed
or
injured
for
as
soon
as
the
ball
struck
me
i
fell
like
a
bird
when
shot
or
an
ox
when
struck
by
a
butcher
and
lost
entirely
and
instantaneously
all
power
of
action
or
locomotion
i
fell
upon
the
and
cried
out
i
am
shot
not
possessing
any
power
to
move
i
felt
myself
falling
outside
of
the
window
but
immediately
i
fell
inside
from
some
at
that
time
unknown
cause
when
i
struck
the
floor
my
animation
seemed
restored
as
i
have
seen
it
sometimes
in
squirrels
and
birds
after
being
shot
as
soon
as
i
felt
the
power
of
motion
i
crawled
under
the
bed
which
was
in
a
corner
of
the
room
not
far
from
the
window
where
i
received
my
wound
while
on
my
way
and
under
the
bed
i
was
wounded
in
three
other
places
one
ball
entered
a
little
below
the
left
knee
and
never
was
extracted
another
entered
the
forepart
of
my
left
arm
a
little
above
the
wrist
and
passing
down
by
the
joint
lodged
in
the
fleshy
part
of
my
hand
about
midway
a
little
above
the
upper
joint
of
my
little
finger
another
struck
me
on
the
fleshy
part
of
my
left
hip
and
tore
away
the
flesh
as
large
as
my
hand
dashing
the
mangled
fragments
of
flesh
and
blood
against
the
wall
my
wounds
were
painful
and
the
sensation
produced
was
as
though
a
ball
had
passed
through
and
down
the
whole
length
of
my
leg
i
very
well
remember
my
reflections
at
the
time
i
had
a
very
painful
idea
of
becoming
lame
and
decrepit
and
being
an
object
of
pity
and
i
felt
as
though
i
would
rather
die
than
be
placed
in
such
circumstances
it
would
seem
that
immediately
after
my
attempt
to
leap
out
of
the
window
joseph
also
did
the
same
thing
of
which
circumstance
i
have
no
knowledge
only
from
information
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
a
cry
that
he
had
leaped
out
of
the
window
a
cessation
of
firing
followed
the
mob
rushed
down
stairs
and
richards
went
to
the
window
immediately
afterwards
i
saw
the
doctor
going
towards
the
jail
door
and
as
there
was
an
iron
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
adjoining
our
door
which
led
into
the
cells
for
criminals
it
struck
me
that
the
doctor
was
going
in
there
and
i
said
to
him
stop
doctor
and
take
me
along
he
proceeded
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
then
returned
and
dragged
me
along
to
a
small
cell
prepared
for
criminals
brother
richards
was
very
much
troubled
and
exclaimed
oh
brother
taylor
is
it
possible
that
they
have
killed
both
brother
hyrum
and
joseph
it
can
not
surely
be
and
yet
i
saw
them
shoot
them
and
elevating
his
hands
two
or
three
times
he
exclaimed
oh
lord
my
god
spare
thy
servants
he
then
said
brother
taylor
this
is
a
terrible
event
and
he
dragged
me
farther
into
the
cell
saying
i
am
sorry
i
can
do
no
better
for
you
and
taking
an
old
filthy
mattress
he
covered
me
with
it
and
said
that
may
hide
you
and
you
may
yet
live
to
tell
the
tale
but
i
expect
they
will
kill
me
in
a
few
moments
while
lying
in
this
position
i
suffered
the
most
excruciating
pain
soon
afterwards
richards
came
to
me
informed
me
that
the
mob
had
precipitately
fled
and
at
the
same
time
confirmed
my
worst
fears
that
joseph
was
assuredly
dead
i
felt
a
dull
lonely
sickening
sensation
at
the
news
when
i
reflected
that
our
noble
chieftain
the
prophet
of
the
living
god
had
fallen
and
that
i
had
seen
his
brother
in
the
cold
embrace
of
death
it
seemed
as
though
there
was
a
void
or
vacuum
in
the
great
field
of
human
existence
to
me
and
a
dark
gloomy
chasm
in
the
kingdom
and
that
we
were
left
alone
oh
how
lonely
was
that
feeling
how
cold
barren
and
desolate
in
the
midst
of
difficulties
he
was
always
the
first
in
motion
in
critical
positions
his
counsel
was
always
sought
as
our
prophet
he
approached
our
god
and
obtained
for
us
his
will
but
now
our
prophet
our
counselor
our
general
our
leader
was
gone
and
amid
the
fiery
ordeal
that
we
then
had
to
pass
through
we
were
left
alone
without
his
aid
and
as
our
future
guide
for
things
spiritual
or
temporal
and
for
all
things
pertaining
to
this
world
or
the
next
he
had
spoken
for
the
last
time
on
earth
these
reflections
and
a
thousand
others
flashed
upon
my
mind
i
thought
why
must
the
good
perish
and
the
virtuous
be
destroyed
why
must
god
nobility
the
salt
of
the
earth
the
most
exalted
of
the
human
family
and
the
most
perfect
types
of
all
excellence
fall
victims
to
the
cruel
fiendish
hate
of
incarnate
devils
the
poignancy
of
my
grief
i
presume
however
was
somewhat
allayed
by
the
extreme
suffering
that
i
endured
from
my
wounds
soon
afterwards
i
was
taken
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
laid
there
where
i
had
a
full
view
of
our
beloved
and
now
murdered
brother
hyrum
there
he
lay
as
i
had
left
him
he
had
not
moved
a
limb
he
lay
placid
and
calm
a
monument
of
greatness
even
in
death
but
his
noble
spirit
had
left
its
tenement
and
was
gone
to
dwell
in
regions
more
congenial
to
its
exalted
nature
poor
hyrum
he
was
a
great
and
good
man
and
my
soul
was
cemented
to
his
if
ever
there
was
an
exemplary
honest
and
virtuous
man
an
embodiment
of
all
that
is
noble
in
the
human
form
hyrum
smith
was
its
representative
while
i
lay
there
a
number
of
persons
came
around
among
whom
was
a
physician
the
doctor
on
seeing
a
ball
lodged
in
my
left
hand
took
a
penknife
from
his
pocket
and
made
an
incision
in
it
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
ball
therefrom
and
having
obtained
a
pair
of
carpenter
compasses
made
use
of
them
to
draw
or
pry
out
the
ball
alternately
using
the
penknife
and
compasses
after
sawing
for
some
time
with
a
dull
penknife
and
prying
and
pulling
with
the
compasses
he
ultimately
succeeded
in
extracting
the
ball
which
weighed
about
half
an
ounce
some
time
afterwards
he
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
that
i
had
nerves
like
the
devil
to
stand
what
i
did
in
its
extraction
i
really
thought
i
had
need
of
nerves
stand
such
surgical
butchery
and
that
whatever
my
nerves
may
be
his
practice
was
devilish
this
company
wished
to
remove
me
to
hamilton
hotel
the
place
where
we
had
stayed
previous
to
our
incarceration
in
jail
i
told
them
however
that
i
did
not
wish
to
go
i
did
not
consider
it
safe
they
protested
that
it
was
and
that
i
was
safe
with
them
that
it
was
a
perfect
outrage
for
men
to
be
used
as
we
had
been
that
they
were
my
friends
that
it
was
for
my
good
they
were
counseling
me
and
that
i
could
be
better
taken
care
of
there
than
here
i
replied
i
do
know
you
who
am
i
among
i
am
surrounded
by
assassins
and
murderers
witness
your
deeds
do
talk
to
me
of
kindness
or
comfort
look
at
your
murdered
victims
look
at
me
i
want
none
of
your
counsel
nor
comfort
there
may
be
some
safety
here
i
can
be
assured
of
none
anywhere
etc
they
g
d
their
souls
to
hell
made
the
most
solemn
asseverations
and
swore
by
god
and
the
devil
and
everything
else
that
they
could
think
of
that
they
would
stand
by
me
to
death
and
protect
me
in
half
an
hour
every
one
of
them
had
fled
from
the
town
soon
after
a
coroner
jury
were
assembled
in
the
room
over
the
body
of
hyrum
among
the
jurors
was
captain
smith
of
the
carthage
grays
who
had
assisted
in
the
murder
and
the
same
justice
before
whom
we
had
been
tried
i
learned
of
francis
higbee
as
being
in
the
neighborhood
on
hearing
his
name
mentioned
i
immediately
arose
and
said
captain
smith
you
are
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
have
heard
his
name
mentioned
i
want
to
swear
my
life
against
him
i
was
informed
that
word
was
immediately
sent
to
him
to
leave
the
place
which
he
did
brother
richards
was
busy
during
this
time
attending
to
the
inquest
and
to
the
removal
of
the
bodies
and
making
arrangements
for
their
removal
from
carthage
to
nauvoo
when
he
had
a
little
leisure
he
again
came
to
me
and
at
his
suggestion
i
was
removed
to
hamilton
tavern
i
felt
that
he
was
the
only
friend
the
only
person
that
i
could
rely
upon
in
that
town
it
was
with
difficulty
that
sufficient
persons
could
be
found
to
carry
me
to
the
tavern
for
immediately
after
the
murder
a
great
fear
fell
upon
all
the
people
and
men
women
and
children
fled
with
great
precipitation
leaving
nothing
nor
anybody
in
the
town
but
two
or
three
women
and
children
and
one
or
two
sick
persons
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
brother
richards
prevailed
upon
hamilton
and
his
family
to
stay
they
would
not
until
brother
richards
had
given
a
solemn
promise
that
he
would
see
them
protected
and
hence
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
hostage
under
these
circumstances
notwithstanding
i
believe
they
were
hostile
to
the
mormons
and
were
glad
that
the
murder
had
taken
place
though
they
did
not
actually
participate
in
it
and
feeling
that
i
should
be
a
protection
to
them
they
stayed
the
whole
community
knew
that
a
dreadful
outrage
had
been
perpetrated
by
those
villains
and
fearing
lest
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
as
they
possessed
the
power
might
have
a
disposition
to
visit
them
with
a
terrible
vengeance
they
fled
in
the
wildest
confusion
and
indeed
it
was
with
very
great
difficulty
that
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
could
be
restrained
a
horrid
barbarous
murder
had
been
committed
the
most
solemn
pledge
violated
and
that
too
while
the
victims
were
contrary
to
the
requirements
of
the
law
putting
themselves
into
the
hands
of
the
governor
to
pacify
a
popular
excitement
this
outrage
was
enhanced
by
the
reflection
that
our
people
were
able
to
protect
themselves
against
not
only
all
the
mob
but
against
three
times
their
number
and
that
of
the
governor
troops
put
together
they
were
also
exasperated
by
the
speech
of
the
governor
in
town
the
whole
events
were
so
faithless
so
dastardly
so
mean
cowardly
and
contemptible
without
one
extenuating
circumstance
that
it
would
not
have
been
surprising
if
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
had
arisen
and
blotted
the
wretches
out
of
existence
the
citizens
of
carthage
knew
they
would
have
done
so
under
such
circumstances
and
judging
us
by
themselves
they
were
all
and
fled
colonel
markham
too
after
his
expulsion
from
carthage
had
gone
home
related
the
circumstances
of
his
ejectment
and
was
using
his
influence
to
get
a
company
to
go
out
fearing
that
when
the
people
heard
that
their
prophet
and
patriarch
had
been
murdered
under
the
above
circumstances
they
might
act
rashly
and
knowing
that
if
they
once
got
roused
like
a
mighty
avalanche
they
would
lay
the
country
waste
before
them
and
take
a
terrible
vengeance
as
none
of
the
twelve
were
in
nauvoo
and
no
one
perhaps
with
sufficient
influence
to
control
the
people
richards
after
consulting
me
wrote
the
following
note
fearing
that
my
family
might
be
seriously
affected
by
the
news
i
told
him
to
insert
that
i
was
slightly
wounded
richards
note
from
carthage
jail
to
carthage
jail
min
june
joseph
and
hyrum
are
dead
taylor
wounded
not
very
badly
i
am
well
our
guard
was
forced
as
we
believe
by
a
band
of
missourians
from
to
the
job
was
done
in
an
instant
and
the
party
fled
towards
nauvoo
instantly
this
is
as
i
believe
it
the
citizens
here
are
afraid
of
the
attacking
them
i
promise
them
no
richards
n
the
citizens
promise
us
protection
alarm
guns
have
been
fired
john
taylor
i
remember
signing
my
name
as
quickly
as
possible
lest
the
tremor
of
my
hand
should
be
noticed
and
the
fears
of
my
family
excited
a
messenger
was
dispatched
immediately
with
the
note
but
he
was
intercepted
by
the
governor
who
on
hearing
a
cannon
fired
at
carthage
which
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
murder
immediately
fled
with
his
company
and
fearing
that
the
citizens
of
nauvoo
when
apprised
of
the
horrible
outrage
would
immediately
rise
and
pursue
he
turned
back
the
messenger
who
was
george
grant
a
second
one
was
sent
who
was
treated
similarly
and
not
until
a
third
attempt
could
news
be
got
to
nauvoo
samuel
smith
brother
to
joseph
and
hyrum
was
the
first
brother
i
saw
after
the
outrage
i
am
not
sure
whether
he
took
the
news
or
not
he
lived
at
the
time
in
plymouth
hancock
county
and
was
on
his
way
to
carthage
to
see
his
brothers
when
he
was
met
by
some
of
the
troops
or
rather
mob
that
had
been
dismissed
by
the
governor
and
who
were
on
their
way
home
on
learning
that
he
was
joseph
smith
brother
they
sought
to
kill
him
but
he
escaped
and
fled
into
the
woods
where
he
was
chased
for
a
length
of
time
by
them
but
after
severe
fatigue
and
much
danger
and
excitement
he
succeeded
in
escaping
and
came
to
carthage
he
was
on
horseback
when
he
arrived
and
was
not
only
very
much
tired
with
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
the
chase
but
was
also
very
much
distressed
in
feelings
on
account
of
the
death
of
his
brothers
these
things
produced
a
fever
which
laid
the
foundation
for
his
death
which
took
place
on
the
of
july
thus
another
of
the
brothers
fell
a
victim
although
not
directly
but
indirectly
to
this
infernal
mob
i
lay
from
about
five
until
two
next
morning
without
having
my
wounds
dressed
as
there
was
scarcely
any
help
of
any
kind
in
carthage
and
brother
richards
was
busy
with
the
dead
bodies
preparing
them
for
removal
my
wife
leonora
started
early
the
next
day
having
had
some
little
trouble
in
getting
a
company
or
a
physician
to
come
with
her
after
considerable
difficulty
she
succeeded
in
getting
an
escort
and
samuel
bennet
came
along
with
her
soon
after
my
father
and
mother
arrived
from
oquakie
near
which
place
they
had
a
farm
at
that
time
and
hearing
of
the
trouble
hastened
along
general
demming
brigadier
general
of
the
hancock
county
militia
was
very
much
of
a
gentleman
and
showed
me
every
courtesy
and
colonel
jones
also
was
very
solicitous
about
my
welfare
i
was
called
upon
by
several
gentlemen
of
quincy
and
other
places
among
whom
was
judge
ralston
as
well
as
by
our
own
people
and
a
medical
man
extracted
a
ball
from
my
left
thigh
that
was
giving
me
much
pain
it
lay
about
half
an
inch
deep
and
my
thigh
was
considerably
swollen
the
doctor
asked
me
if
i
would
be
tied
during
the
operation
i
told
him
no
that
i
could
endure
the
cutting
associated
with
the
operation
as
well
without
and
i
did
so
indeed
so
great
was
the
pain
i
endured
that
the
cutting
was
rather
a
relief
than
otherwise
a
very
laughable
incident
occurred
at
the
time
my
wife
leonora
went
into
an
adjoining
room
to
pray
for
me
that
i
might
be
sustained
during
the
operation
while
on
her
knees
at
prayer
a
bedell
an
old
lady
of
the
methodist
association
entered
and
patting
taylor
on
her
back
with
her
hand
said
there
a
good
lady
pray
for
god
to
forgive
your
sins
pray
that
you
may
be
converted
and
the
lord
may
have
mercy
on
your
soul
the
scene
was
so
ludicrous
that
taylor
knew
not
whether
to
laugh
or
be
angry
taylor
informed
me
that
hamilton
the
father
of
the
hamilton
who
kept
the
house
rejoiced
at
the
murder
and
said
in
company
that
it
was
done
up
in
the
best
possible
style
and
showed
good
generalship
and
she
further
believed
that
the
other
branches
of
the
family
sanctioned
it
these
were
the
associates
of
the
old
lady
referred
to
and
yet
she
could
talk
of
conversion
and
saving
souls
in
the
midst
of
blood
and
murder
such
is
man
and
such
consistency
the
ball
being
extracted
was
the
one
that
first
struck
me
which
i
before
referred
to
it
entered
on
the
outside
of
my
left
thigh
about
five
inches
from
my
knee
and
passing
rather
obliquely
towards
my
body
had
it
would
seem
struck
the
bone
for
it
was
flatted
out
nearly
as
thin
and
large
as
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
the
governor
passed
on
staying
at
carthage
only
a
few
minutes
and
he
did
not
stop
until
he
got
fifty
miles
from
nauvoo
there
had
been
various
opinions
about
the
complicity
of
the
governor
in
the
murder
some
supposing
that
he
knew
all
about
it
and
assisted
or
winked
at
its
execution
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
form
a
correct
opinion
from
the
facts
presented
it
is
very
certain
that
things
looked
more
than
suspicious
against
him
in
the
first
place
he
positively
knew
that
we
had
broken
no
law
secondly
he
knew
that
the
mob
had
not
only
passed
inflammatory
resolutions
threatening
extermination
to
the
mormons
but
that
they
had
actually
assembled
armed
mobs
and
commenced
hostilities
against
us
thirdly
he
took
those
very
mobs
that
had
been
arrayed
against
us
and
enrolled
them
as
his
troops
thus
legalizing
their
acts
fourthly
he
disbanded
the
nauvoo
legion
which
had
never
violated
law
and
disarmed
them
and
had
about
his
person
in
the
shape
of
militia
known
mobocrats
and
violators
of
the
law
fifthly
he
requested
us
to
come
to
carthage
without
arms
promising
protection
and
then
refused
to
interfere
in
delivering
us
from
prison
although
joseph
and
hyrum
were
put
there
contrary
to
law
sixthly
although
he
refused
to
interfere
in
our
behalf
yet
when
captain
smith
went
to
him
and
informed
him
that
the
persons
refused
to
come
out
he
told
him
that
he
had
a
command
and
knew
what
to
do
thus
sanctioning
the
use
of
force
in
the
violation
of
law
when
opposed
to
us
whereas
he
would
not
for
us
interpose
his
executive
authority
to
free
us
from
being
incarcerated
contrary
to
law
although
he
was
fully
informed
of
all
the
facts
of
the
case
as
we
kept
him
posted
in
the
affairs
all
the
time
seventhly
he
left
the
prisoners
in
carthage
jail
contrary
to
his
plighted
faith
eightly
before
he
went
he
dismissed
all
the
troops
that
could
be
relied
upon
as
well
as
many
of
the
mob
and
left
us
in
charge
of
the
carthage
grays
a
company
that
he
knew
were
mobocratic
our
most
bitter
enemies
and
who
had
passed
resolutions
to
exterminate
us
and
who
had
been
placed
under
guard
by
general
demming
only
the
day
before
ninthly
he
was
informed
of
the
intended
murder
both
before
he
left
and
while
on
the
road
by
several
different
parties
tenthly
when
the
cannon
was
fired
in
carthage
signifying
that
the
deed
was
done
he
immediately
took
up
his
line
of
march
and
fled
how
did
he
know
that
this
signal
portrayed
their
death
if
he
was
not
in
the
secret
it
may
be
said
some
of
the
party
told
him
how
could
he
believe
what
the
party
said
about
the
gun
signal
if
he
could
not
believe
the
testimony
of
several
individuals
who
told
him
in
positive
terms
about
the
contemplated
murder
he
has
i
believe
stated
that
he
left
the
carthage
grays
there
because
he
considered
that
as
their
town
was
contiguous
to
ours
and
as
the
responsibility
of
our
safety
rested
solely
upon
them
they
would
not
dare
suffer
any
indignity
to
befall
us
this
very
admission
shows
that
he
did
really
expect
danger
and
then
he
knew
that
these
people
had
published
to
the
world
that
they
would
exterminate
us
and
his
leaving
us
in
their
hands
and
taking
of
their
responsibilities
was
like
leaving
a
lamb
in
charge
of
a
wolf
and
trusting
to
its
humanity
and
honor
for
its
it
is
said
again
that
he
would
not
have
gone
to
nauvoo
and
thus
placed
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
mormons
if
he
had
anticipated
any
such
event
as
he
would
be
exposed
to
their
wrath
to
this
it
may
be
answered
that
the
mormons
did
not
know
their
signals
while
he
did
and
they
were
also
known
in
warsaw
as
well
as
in
other
places
and
as
soon
as
the
gun
was
fired
a
merchant
of
warsaw
jumped
upon
his
horse
and
rode
directly
to
quincy
and
reported
joseph
and
hyrum
killed
and
those
who
were
with
them
in
jail
he
reported
further
that
they
were
attempting
to
break
jail
and
were
all
killed
by
the
guard
this
was
their
story
it
was
anticipated
to
kill
all
and
the
gun
was
to
be
the
signal
that
the
deed
was
accomplished
this
was
known
in
warsaw
the
governor
also
knew
it
and
fled
and
he
could
really
be
in
no
danger
in
nauvoo
for
the
mormons
did
not
know
it
and
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
escape
which
he
did
it
is
said
that
he
made
all
his
officers
promise
solemnly
that
they
would
help
him
to
protect
the
smiths
this
may
or
may
not
be
at
any
rate
some
of
these
same
officers
helped
to
murder
them
the
strongest
argument
in
the
governor
favor
and
one
that
would
bear
more
weight
with
us
than
all
the
rest
put
together
would
be
that
he
could
not
believe
them
capable
of
such
atrocity
and
thinking
that
their
talk
and
threatenings
were
a
mere
ebullition
of
feeling
a
kind
of
braggadocio
and
that
there
was
enough
of
good
moral
feeling
to
control
the
more
violent
passions
he
trusted
to
their
faith
there
is
indeed
a
degree
of
plausibility
about
this
but
when
we
put
it
in
juxtaposition
to
the
amount
of
evidence
that
he
was
in
possession
of
it
weighs
very
little
he
had
nothing
to
inspire
confidence
in
them
and
everything
to
make
him
mistrust
them
besides
why
his
broken
faith
why
his
disregard
of
what
was
told
him
by
several
parties
again
if
he
knew
not
the
plan
how
did
he
understand
the
signal
why
so
oblivious
to
everything
pertaining
to
the
mormon
interest
and
so
alive
and
interested
about
the
mobocrats
at
any
rate
be
this
as
it
may
he
stands
responsible
for
their
blood
and
it
is
dripping
on
his
garments
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
promises
of
protection
they
would
have
protected
themselves
it
was
plighted
faith
that
led
them
to
the
slaughter
and
to
make
the
best
of
it
it
was
a
breach
of
that
faith
and
a
of
that
promise
after
repeated
warning
that
led
to
their
death
having
said
so
much
i
must
leave
the
governor
with
my
readers
and
with
his
god
justice
i
conceive
demanded
this
much
and
truth
could
not
be
told
with
less
as
i
have
said
before
my
opinion
is
that
the
governor
would
not
have
planned
this
murder
but
he
had
not
sufficient
energy
to
resist
popular
opinion
even
if
that
opinion
led
to
blood
and
death
it
was
rumored
that
a
strong
political
party
numbering
in
its
ranks
many
of
the
prominent
men
of
the
nation
were
engaged
in
a
plot
for
the
overthrow
of
joseph
smith
and
that
the
governor
was
of
this
party
and
sharp
williams
captain
smith
and
others
were
his
accomplices
but
whether
this
was
the
case
or
not
i
do
not
know
it
is
very
certain
that
a
strong
political
feeling
existed
against
joseph
smith
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
his
letters
to
henry
clay
were
made
use
of
by
political
parties
opposed
to
clay
and
were
the
means
of
that
statesman
defeat
yet
if
such
a
combination
as
the
one
referred
to
existed
i
am
not
apprised
of
it
while
i
lay
at
carthage
previous
to
taylor
arrival
a
pretty
good
sort
of
a
man
who
was
lame
of
a
leg
waited
upon
me
and
sat
up
at
night
with
me
afterwards
taylor
mother
and
others
waited
upon
me
many
friends
called
upon
me
among
whom
were
richard
ballantyne
elizabeth
taylor
several
of
the
perkins
family
and
a
number
of
the
brethren
from
macedonia
and
la
harpe
besides
these
many
strangers
from
quincy
some
of
whom
expressed
indignant
feelings
against
the
mob
and
sympathy
for
myself
brother
alexander
williams
called
upon
me
who
suspected
that
they
had
some
designs
in
keeping
me
there
and
stated
that
he
had
at
a
given
point
in
some
woods
fifty
men
and
if
i
would
say
the
word
he
would
raise
other
fifty
and
fetch
me
out
of
there
i
thanked
him
but
told
him
i
thought
there
was
no
need
however
it
would
seem
that
i
was
in
some
danger
for
colonel
jones
before
referred
to
when
absent
from
me
left
two
loaded
pistols
on
the
table
in
case
of
an
attack
and
some
time
afterward
when
i
had
recovered
and
was
publishing
the
affair
a
lawyer
backman
stated
that
he
had
prevented
a
man
by
the
name
of
jackson
before
referred
to
from
ascending
the
stairs
who
was
coming
with
a
design
to
murder
me
and
that
now
he
was
sorry
he
had
not
let
him
do
the
deed
there
were
others
also
of
whom
i
heard
that
said
i
ought
to
be
killed
and
they
would
do
it
but
that
it
was
too
damned
cowardly
to
shoot
a
wounded
man
and
thus
by
the
chivalry
of
murderers
i
was
prevented
from
being
a
second
time
mutilated
or
killed
many
of
the
mob
came
around
and
treated
me
with
apparent
respect
and
the
officers
and
people
generally
looked
upon
me
as
a
hostage
and
feared
that
my
removal
would
be
the
signal
for
the
rising
of
the
mormons
i
do
not
remember
the
time
that
i
stayed
at
carthage
but
i
think
three
or
four
days
after
the
murder
when
brother
marks
with
a
carriage
brother
james
allred
with
a
wagon
ells
and
a
number
of
others
on
horseback
came
for
the
purpose
of
taking
me
to
nauvoo
i
was
very
weak
at
the
time
occasioned
by
the
loss
of
blood
and
the
great
discharge
of
my
wounds
so
when
my
wife
asked
me
if
i
could
talk
i
could
barely
whisper
no
quite
a
discussion
arose
as
to
the
propriety
of
my
removal
the
physician
and
people
of
carthage
protesting
that
it
would
be
my
death
while
my
friends
were
anxious
for
my
removal
if
possible
i
suppose
the
former
were
actuated
by
the
desire
to
keep
me
colonel
jones
was
i
believe
sincere
he
had
acted
as
a
friend
all
the
time
and
he
told
taylor
she
ought
to
persuade
me
not
to
go
for
he
did
not
believe
i
had
strength
enough
to
reach
nauvoo
it
was
finally
agreed
however
that
i
should
go
but
it
was
thought
that
i
could
not
stand
riding
in
a
wagon
or
carriage
they
prepared
a
litter
for
me
i
was
carried
down
stairs
and
put
upon
it
a
number
of
men
assisted
to
carry
me
some
of
whom
had
been
engaged
in
the
mob
as
soon
as
i
got
down
stairs
i
felt
much
better
and
strengthened
so
that
i
could
talk
i
suppose
the
effect
of
the
fresh
air
when
we
got
near
the
outside
of
the
town
i
remembered
some
woods
that
we
had
to
go
through
and
telling
a
person
near
to
call
for
ells
who
was
riding
a
very
good
horse
i
said
doctor
i
perceive
that
the
people
are
getting
fatigued
with
carrying
me
a
number
of
mormons
live
about
two
or
three
miles
from
here
near
our
route
will
you
ride
to
their
settlement
as
quick
as
possible
and
have
them
come
and
meet
us
he
started
off
on
a
gallop
immediately
my
object
in
this
was
to
obtain
protection
in
case
of
an
attack
rather
than
to
obtain
help
to
carry
me
very
soon
after
the
men
from
carthage
made
one
excuse
after
another
until
they
had
all
left
and
i
felt
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
i
found
that
the
tramping
of
those
carrying
me
produced
violent
pain
and
a
sleigh
was
produced
and
attached
to
the
hind
end
of
brother
james
allred
wagon
a
bed
placed
upon
it
and
i
propped
up
on
the
bed
taylor
rode
with
me
applying
ice
and
to
my
wounds
as
the
sleigh
was
dragged
over
the
grass
on
the
prairie
which
was
quite
tall
it
moved
very
easy
and
gave
me
very
little
pain
when
i
got
within
five
or
six
miles
of
nauvoo
the
brethren
commenced
to
meet
me
from
the
city
and
they
increased
in
number
as
we
drew
nearer
until
there
was
a
very
large
company
of
people
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
principally
however
men
for
some
time
there
had
been
almost
incessant
rain
so
that
in
many
low
places
on
the
prairie
it
was
from
one
to
three
feet
deep
in
water
and
at
such
places
the
brethren
whom
we
met
took
hold
of
the
sleigh
lifted
it
and
carried
it
over
the
water
and
when
we
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
city
where
the
roads
were
excessively
muddy
and
bad
the
brethren
tore
down
the
fences
and
we
passed
through
the
fields
never
shall
i
forget
the
difference
of
feeling
that
i
experienced
between
the
place
that
i
had
left
and
the
one
that
i
had
now
arrived
at
i
had
left
a
lot
of
reckless
bloodthirsty
murderers
and
had
come
to
the
city
of
the
saints
the
people
of
the
living
god
friends
of
truth
and
righteousness
thousands
of
whom
stood
there
with
warm
true
hearts
to
offer
their
friendship
and
services
and
to
welcome
my
return
it
is
true
it
was
a
painful
scene
and
brought
sorrowful
remembrance
to
mind
but
to
me
it
caused
a
thrill
of
joy
to
find
myself
once
more
in
the
bosom
of
my
friends
and
to
meet
with
the
cordial
welcome
of
true
honest
hearts
what
was
very
remarkable
i
found
myself
very
much
better
after
my
arrival
at
nauvoo
than
i
was
when
i
started
on
my
journey
although
i
had
travelled
eighteen
miles
the
next
day
as
some
change
was
wanting
i
told
taylor
that
if
she
could
send
to
richards
he
had
my
purse
and
watch
and
they
would
find
money
in
my
purse
previous
to
the
doctor
leaving
carthage
i
told
him
that
he
had
better
take
my
purse
and
watch
for
i
was
afraid
the
people
would
steal
them
the
doctor
had
taken
my
pantaloons
pocket
and
put
the
watch
in
it
with
the
purse
cut
off
the
pocket
and
tied
a
string
around
the
top
it
was
in
this
position
when
brought
home
my
family
however
were
not
a
little
startled
to
find
that
my
watch
had
been
struck
with
a
ball
i
sent
for
my
vest
and
upon
examination
it
was
found
that
there
was
a
cut
as
if
with
a
knife
in
the
vest
pocket
which
had
contained
my
watch
in
the
pocket
the
fragments
of
the
glass
were
found
literally
ground
to
powder
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
a
ball
had
struck
me
at
the
time
i
felt
myself
falling
out
of
the
window
and
that
it
was
this
force
that
threw
me
inside
i
had
often
remarked
to
taylor
the
singular
fact
of
finding
myself
inside
the
room
when
i
felt
a
moment
before
after
being
shot
that
i
was
falling
out
and
i
never
could
account
for
it
until
then
but
here
the
thing
was
fully
elucidated
and
was
rendered
plain
to
my
mind
i
was
indeed
falling
out
when
some
villain
aimed
at
my
heart
the
ball
struck
my
watch
and
forced
me
back
if
i
had
fallen
out
i
should
assuredly
have
been
killed
if
not
by
the
fall
by
those
around
and
this
ball
intended
to
dispatch
me
was
turned
by
an
overruling
providence
into
a
messenger
of
mercy
and
saved
my
life
i
shall
never
forget
the
feelings
of
gratitude
that
i
then
experienced
towards
my
heavenly
father
the
whole
scene
was
vividly
portrayed
before
me
and
my
heart
melted
before
the
lord
i
felt
that
the
lord
had
preserved
me
by
a
special
act
of
mercy
that
my
time
had
not
yet
come
and
that
i
had
still
a
work
to
perform
upon
the
earth
