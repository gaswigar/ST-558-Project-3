came
these
grim
cold
men

earth
people
and
carry
them
to
a
weird
and
terrible
world
where
a
man
could
be

giant

lee
anthony
crouched
and
set
himself
to
resist
the
attack
of
the
robed
men
the
world
beyond
by
ray
cummings
the
old
woman
was
dying
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
now
surely
she
would
not
last
through
the
night
in
the
dim
quiet
bedroom
he
sat
watching
her
his
young
face
grim
and
awed
pathetic
business
this
ending
of
earthly
life
this
passing
on
in
the
silence
from
the
living
room
downstairs
the
gay
laughter
of
the
young
people
at
the
birthday
party
came
floating
up
his
birthday
lee
anthony
years
old
today
he
had
thought
he
would
feel
very
different
becoming
legally
a
man
but
the
only
difference
now
was
that
old
anna
green
who
had
been
always
so
good
to
him
who
had
taken
care
of
him
almost
all
his
life
now
was
dying
terrible
business
but
old
age
is
queer
anna
knew
what
was
happening
the
doctor
who
had
given
lee
the
medicines
and
said
he
would
be
back
in
the
morning
had
fooled
her
and
she
had
only
smiled
lee
tensed
as
he
saw
that
she
was
smiling
now
and
she
opened
her
eyes
his
hand
went
to
hers
where
it
lay
so
white
on
the
white
bedspread
i
here
anna
feel
better
oh
yes
i
all
right
her
faint
voice
gently
tired
mingled
with
the
sounds
from
the
party
downstairs
she
heard
the
laughter
you
should
be
down
there
lee
i
all
right
i
should
have
postponed
it
he
said
and
what
you
did
preparing
for
it
she
interrupted
him
raising
her
thin
arm
which
must
have
seemed
so
heavy
that
at
once
she
let
it
fall
again
lee
i
guess
i
am
glad
here
want
to
talk
to
you
and
i
guess
it
better
be
now
tomorrow
you
too
tired
now
for
me
she
said
with
her
gentle
smile
there
may
not
be
any
tomorrow
not
here
your
grandfather
lee
you
really
do
remember
him
i
was
only
four
or
five
yes
that
was
when
your
father
and
mother
died
in
the
aero
accident
and
your
grandfather
brought
you
to
me
very
vaguely
he
could
remember
it
he
had
always
understood
that
anna
green
had
loved
his
grandfather
who
had
died
that
same
year
what
i
want
to
tell
you
lee
she
seemed
summoning
all
her
last
remaining
strength
your
grandfather
did
die
he
just
went
away
what
you
never
known
he
was
a
scientist
but
he
was
a
lot
more
than
that
he
had
dreams
dreams
of
what
we
mortals
might
be
what
we
ought
to
be
but
are
not
and
so
he
went
away
this
dying
old
woman
her
mind
was
wandering
oh
yes
lee
said
but
you
much
too
tired
now
anna
dear
please
let
me
tell
you
he
had
some
scientific
apparatus
i
did
see
it
i
do
know
where
he
went
i
think
he
did
know
either
where
he
was
going
but
he
was
a
very
good
man
lee
i
think
he
had
an
intuition
an
inspiration
yes
it
must
have
been
that
a
man
inspired
and
so
he
went
i
never
seen
or
heard
from
him
since
yet
what
he
promised
me
if
he
could
accomplish
it
tonight
almost
now
lee
would
be
the
time
just
a
desperately
sick
old
woman
whose
blurred
mind
was
seeing
visions
the
thin
wrinkled
face
like
crumpled
white
parchment
was
transfigured
as
though
by
a
vision
her
sunken
eyes
were
bright
with
it
a
wonderment
stirred
within
lee
anthony
why
was
his
heart
pounding
it
seemed
suddenly
as
though
he
must
be
sharing
this
unknown
thing
of
science
and
mysticism
as
though
something
within
him
his
grandfather
blood
perhaps
was
responding
he
felt
suddenly
wildly
excited
tonight
he
murmured
your
grandfather
was
a
very
good
man
lee
and
you
anna
all
my
life
i
have
known
how
good
you
are
not
like
most
women
you
just
all
gentleness
just
kindness
that
was
maybe
just
an
inspiration
from
him
her
face
was
bright
with
it
i
tried
to
bring
you
up
the
way
he
told
me
and
what
i
must
tell
you
now
about
tonight
i
mean
because
i
may
not
live
to
see
it
her
breath
gave
out
so
that
her
faint
tired
voice
trailed
away
what
he
urged
what
is
it
anna
about
tonight
what
a
tumult
of
weird
excitement
was
within
him
surely
this
was
something
momentous
his
birthday
different
surely
for
lee
anthony
than
any
similar
event
had
ever
been
for
anyone
else
he
promised
me
when
you
were
just
then
at
this
time
if
he
could
manage
it
that
he
would
come
back
come
back
anna
here
yes
to
you
and
me
because
you
would
be
a
man
brought
up
the
best
i
could
do
to
make
you
be
like
him
because
you
would
be
a
man
who
would
know
the
value
of
love
and
kindness
those
things
that
ought
to
rule
this
world
but
really
do
not
this
wild
unreasoning
excitement
within
him
you
think
he
will
come
tonight
anna
i
really
do
i
want
to
live
to
see
him
but
now
i
do
know
he
could
only
sit
in
silence
gripping
her
hand
and
again
the
gay
voices
of
his
guests
downstairs
came
up
like
a
roar
of
intrusion
they
did
know
that
she
was
more
than
indisposed
she
had
made
him
promise
not
to
tell
them
her
eyes
had
closed
and
now
she
opened
them
again
they
having
a
good
time
are
they
lee
that
what
i
wanted
for
you
and
them
both
you
see
i
had
to
be
careful
not
to
isolate
you
from
life
life
as
it
is
because
your
grandfather
wanted
you
to
be
normal
a
healthy
happy
regular
young
man
not
queer
even
though
i
tried
to
show
you
if
he
he
coming
tonight
anna
we
should
have
guests
here
when
they
have
had
their
fun
they
have
we
about
finished
down
there
i
get
rid
of
them
tell
them
you
not
very
well
she
nodded
perhaps
that
best
now
he
was
hardly
aware
of
how
he
broke
up
the
party
and
sent
them
away
then
in
the
sudden
heavy
silence
of
the
little
cottage
here
in
the
grove
of
trees
near
the
edge
of
the
town
he
went
quietly
back
upstairs
her
eyes
were
closed
her
white
face
was
placid
her
faint
breath
was
barely
discernible
failing
fast
now
quietly
he
sat
beside
her
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
do
the
doctor
had
said
that
very
probably
she
could
not
live
through
the
night
poor
old
anna
his
mind
rehearsed
the
life
that
she
had
given
him
always
she
had
been
so
gentle
so
wise
ruling
him
with
kindness
he
remembered
some
of
the
things
she
had
reiterated
so
often
that
his
childish
mind
had
come
to
realize
their
inevitable
truth
the
greatest
instinctive
desire
of
every
living
creature
is
happiness
and
the
way
to
get
it
was
not
by
depriving
others
of
it
it
seemed
now
as
though
this
old
woman
had
had
something
of
goodness
inherent
to
her
as
though
she
were
inspired
and
tonight
she
had
said
with
her
gentle
smile
as
she
lay
dying
that
if
that
were
so
it
had
been
an
inspiration
from
his
grandfather
something
of
science
which
his
grandfather
had
devised
and
which
had
enabled
him
to
go
away
what
could
that
mean
go
where
and
why
had
he
gone
to
seek
an
ideal
because
he
was
dissatisfied
with
life
here
her
half
incoherent
words
had
seemed
to
imply
that
and
now
because
lee
was
a
man
his
grandfather
was
coming
back
because
he
had
thought
that
lee
would
be
able
to
help
him
help
him
to
do
what
he
stirred
in
his
chair
it
was
nearly
midnight
now
the
little
cottage
this
little
second
floor
bedroom
where
death
was
hovering
was
heavy
with
brooding
silence
it
was
awesome
almost
frightening
he
bent
closer
to
the
bed
was
she
dead
no
there
was
still
a
faint
fluttering
breath
but
it
seemed
now
that
there
would
be
no
strength
for
her
to
speak
to
him
again
mysterious
business
this
passing
on
her
eyelids
were
closed
a
symbol
of
drawn
blinds
of
the
crumbling
old
house
in
which
she
had
lived
for
so
long
it
was
almost
a
tenantless
house
now
and
yet
she
was
somewhere
down
there
behind
those
drawn
blinds
reluctant
perhaps
to
leave
still
she
lingered
with
the
fires
going
out
so
that
it
must
be
cold
cold
and
silent
where
she
huddled
or
was
she
hearing
now
the
great
organ
of
the
beyond
with
its
sweep
of
harmonies
summoning
her
to
come
welcoming
her
a
shiver
ran
through
young
lee
anthony
as
he
saw
that
the
pallid
bloodless
lips
of
the
white
wrinkled
face
had
stirred
into
a
smile
down
there
somewhere
her
spirit
awed
and
a
little
frightened
doubtless
had
opened
some
door
to
let
the
sound
of
the
organ
in
and
to
let
in
the
great
riot
of
color
which
must
have
been
outside
and
then
she
had
not
been
frightened
but
eager
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
was
staring
at
an
empty
shell
and
that
old
anna
green
had
gone
a
sound
abruptly
brought
lee
out
of
his
awed
thoughts
it
was
outside
the
house
the
crunching
of
wheels
in
the
gravel
of
the
driveway
the
squeal
of
grinding
brakes
a
car
had
stopped
he
sat
erect
in
his
chair
stiffened
listening
with
his
heart
pounding
so
that
the
beat
of
it
seemed
to
shake
his
tense
body
his
grandfather
returning
an
automobile
horn
honked
footsteps
sounded
on
the
verandah
the
front
doorbell
rang
there
were
voices
outside
as
he
crossed
the
living
room
a
man
voice
and
then
a
girl
laugh
he
flung
open
the
door
it
was
a
young
man
in
dinner
clothes
and
a
tall
blonde
girl
tom
franklin
and
a
vivid
girl
whom
lee
had
never
seen
before
she
was
inches
taller
than
her
companion
she
stood
clinging
to
his
arm
her
beautiful
face
with
beaded
lashes
and
heavily
rouged
lips
was
laughing
she
was
swaying
her
companion
steadied
her
but
he
was
swaying
himself

the
girl
said
she
stared
up
at
lee
he
towered
above
her
and
beside
him
the
undersized
and
franklin
was
swaying
happily
admiration
leaped
into
the
girl
eyes
say
she
murmured

agreed
awkwardly
he
had
only
met
young
tom
franklin
once
or
twice
a
year
ago
now
and
lee
had
completely
forgotten
it
the
son
of
a
rich
man
with
more
money
than
was
good
for
him
with
old
anna
lying
there
upstairs
surely
he
did
not
want
these
happy
inebriated
guests
here
now
he
stood
with
them
just
inside
the
threshold
i
i
awfully
sorry
he
began
my
birthday
yes
but

see
old
green
my

blankly
say
my
gawd
that
tough
the
girl
murmured
your
birthday
too
tommy
listen
we
got
ta
get
goin
ca
celebrate
it
seemed
that
there
was
just
a
shadow
out
on
the
dark
verandah
a
tall
figure
in
a
dark
cloak
why
what
the
hell
franklin
muttered
a
group
of
gliding
soundless
figures
were
out
there
in
the
darkness
and
across
the
living
room
the
window
sash
went
up
with
a
thump
a
black
shape
was
there
huddled
in
a
great
loose
cloak
which
was
over
the
head
so
that
the
thing
inside
was
shapeless
for
an
instant
lee
and
his
two
companions
stood
stricken
the
shapes
seemed
babbling
with
weird
unintelligible
words
then
from
the
window
came
words
of
english
want
slow
words
strangely
intoned
young
tom
franklin
broke
in
on
them
say
what
the
devil
who
do
you
people
think
you
are
comin
in
here
he
took
a
swaying
step
over
the
threshold
there
was
a
sudden
sharp
command
from
one
of
the
shapes
lee
jumped
in
front
of
the
girl
on
the
verandah
the
gliding
figures
were
engulfing
franklin
he
had
fallen
lee
went
through
the
door
with
a
leap
his
fist
driving
at
the
cowled
head
of
one
of
the
figures
a
solid
shape
that
staggered
backward
from
his
blow
but
the
others
were
on
him
dropping
down
before
his
rush
gripping
his
legs
and
ankles
he
went
down
fighting
and
then
something
struck
his
face
something
that
was
like
a
hand
or
a
paw
with
claws
that
scratched
him
his
head
suddenly
was
reeling
his
senses
fading
how
long
he
fought
lee
did
not
know
he
was
aware
that
the
girl
was
screaming
and
that
he
was
hurling
clutching
figures
away
figures
that
came
pouncing
back
then
the
roaring
in
his
head
was
a
vast
uproar
the
fighting
scrambling
dark
shapes
all
seemed
dwindling
until
they
were
tiny
points
of
white
light
like
stars
in
the
great
abyss
of
nothingness
he
knew
as
though
it
were
a
blurred
dream
that
he
was
lying
inert
on
the
verandah
with
franklin
and
the
girl
lying
beside
him
the
house
was
being
searched
then
the
muttering
shapes
were
standing
here
lee
felt
himself
being
picked
up
and
then
he
was
carried
silently
out
into
the
darkness
the
motion
seemed
to
waft
him
off
so
that
he
knew
nothing
more
chapter
ii
flight
into
size
and
lee
came
back
to
consciousness
with
the
feeling
that
some
great
length
of
time
must
have
elapsed
he
was
on
a
couch
in
a
small
metal
room
metal
of
a
dull
substance
like
nothing
he
had
ever
seen
before
with
his
head
still
swimming
he
got
up
dizzily
on
one
elbow
trying
to
remember
what
had
happened
to
him
that
fingernail
or
claw
had
scratched
his
face
he
had
been
drugged
it
seemed
obvious
he
could
remember
his
roaring
senses
as
he
had
tried
to
fight
with
the
drug
gradually
overcoming
him
the
room
had
a
small
door
and
a
single
round
window
like
a
bullseye
pane
of
thick
lens
outside
there
was
darkness
with
points
of
stars
his
head
was
still
humming
from
the
remaining
effect
of
the
drug
or
was
the
humming
an
outside
noise
he
was
aware
as
he
got
to
his
feet
and
staggered
to
the
door
that
the
humming
was
distantly
outside
the
room
the
door
was
locked
its
lever
resisted
his
efforts
to
turn
it
there
he
saw
the
inert
figures
of
the
girl
and
tom
franklin
they
were
lying
uninjured
on
two
other
small
couches
against
the
room
metal
wall
the
girl
stirred
a
little
as
he
touched
her
dank
forehead
her
dyed
blonde
hair
had
fallen
disheveled
to
her
shoulders
franklin
lay
sprawled
his
stiff
white
shirt
bosom
dirty
and
rumpled
his
thin
sandy
hair
dangling
over
his
flushed
face
his
slack
mouth
was
open
he
was
breathing
heavily
at
the
lee
stood
gasping
his
mind
still
confused
and
blurred
trying
to
encompass
what
was
out
there
this
was
a
spaceship
a
small
globular
thing
of
white
metal
he
could
see
a
rim
of
it
like
a
flat
ring
some
ten
feet
beneath
him
a
spaceship
and
obviously
it
had
left
the
earth
there
was
a
black
firmament
monstrous
abyss
with
white
blazing
points
of
stars
and
then
down
below
and
to
one
side
there
was
just
an
edge
of
a
great
globe
visible
the
earth
with
the
sunlight
edging
its
sweeping
crescent
limb
the
earth
down
there
with
a
familiar
coastline
and
a
huge
spread
of
ocean
like
a
giant
map
in
monochrome
back
on
the
couch
lee
sat
numbed
there
was
the
sound
of
scraping
metal
a
doorslide
in
the
wall
opened
a
face
was
there
a
man
with
a
blur
of
opalescent
light
behind
him
you
are
all
right
now
a
voice
said
yes
i
guess
so
let
me
out
of
here
let
him
out
of
here
to
do
what
to
make
them
head
this
thing
back
to
earth
to
lee
anthony
as
he
sat
confused
the
very
thoughts
were
a
fantasy
off
the
earth
out
in
space
so
often
he
had
read
of
it
as
a
future
scientific
possibility
but
with
this
actuality
now
his
mind
seemed
hardly
to
grasp
it
the
man
voice
said
gently
we
can
not
trust
you
there
must
be
no
fighting
i
wo
fight
what
good
could
it
do
me
you
did
fight
that
was
bad
that
was
frightening
we
must
not
harm
you
where
are
we
going
lee
murmured
why
in
the
devil
are
you
we
think
now
it
is
best
to
say
nothing
we
will
give
you
food
through
here
and
over
there
behind
you
a
little
doorslide
to
another
room
you
and
these
other
two
can
be
comfortable
for
how
long
lee
demanded
it
should
not
seem
many
days
soon
we
shall
go
fast
please
watch
it
at
the
window
he
would
want
that
you
have
been
taught
some
science
yes
i
guess
so
to
lee
it
was
a
weird
unnatural
exchange
between
captor
and
captive
the
voice
intoning
the
english
words
so
slowly
so
carefully
seemed
gentle
concerned
with
his
welfare
and
afraid
of
him
abruptly
the
doorslide
closed
again
and
then
at
once
it
reopened
he
would
want
you
to
understand
what
you
see
the
man
said
you
will
find
it
very
wonderful
we
did
coming
down
here
this
was
his
room
so
long
ago
when
he
used
it
his
dials
are
there
you
can
watch
them
and
try
to
understand
dials
to
mark
our
distance
and
our
size
the
will
start
soon
lee
numbed
mind
turned
over
the
words
and
found
them
almost
meaningless
from
the
window
there
what
you
can
see
will
be
very
wonderful
the
man
said
again
he
would
want
you
to
study
it
please
do
that
the
doorslide
closed
what
you
can
see
from
the
window
will
be
very
wonderful
no
one
during
the
days
that
followed
could
adequately
describe
what
lee
anthony
and
thomas
franklin
and
vivian
saw
through
that
a
vast
panorama
in
monochrome
a
soundless
drama
of
the
stars
so
immense
so
awesome
that
the
human
mind
could
grasp
only
an
infinitesimal
fragment
of
its
wonders
they
found
the
little
door
which
led
into
another
apartment
there
were
tables
and
chairs
of
quaintly
food
and
drink
were
shoved
through
the
doorslide
the
necessities
of
life
and
a
fair
comfort
of
living
were
provided
but
their
questions
even
as
the
time
passed
and
lengthened
into
what
on
earth
might
have
been
a
week
or
more
remained
unanswered
there
was
only
that
gentle
but
firm
negation
we
have
decided
that
he
would
want
us
to
say
nothing
we
do
not
know
about
this
girl
and
this
smaller
man
we
brought
them
so
that
they
could
not
remain
on
earth
to
talk
of
having
seen
us
we
are
sorry
about
that
he
probably
wo
like
it
he
who
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
franklin
demanded
see
here
if
i
had
you
fellows
back
on
earth
now
i
slam
you
into
jail
damned
brigands
you
ca
do
this
to
me
my
my
father
one
of
the
most
important
men
in
new
york
but
now
the
doorslide
quietly
closed
a
week
it
could
have
been
that
or
more
in
a
wall
recess
of
the
room
lee
found
a
line
of
tiny
dials
with
moving
pointers
miles
thousands
of
miles
a
million
ten
millions
a
hundred
million
a
tens
thousands
and
for
the
a
normal
diameter
unit
and
then
up
into
thousands
for
hours
at
a
time
silent
awed
beyond
what
he
had
ever
conceived
the
emotion
of
awe
could
mean
he
sat
at
the
staring
out
and
trying
to
understand
the
was
some
thousand
miles
out
from
earth
when
the
of
the
weird
little
vehicle
began
it
came
to
lee
with
a
sudden
shock
to
his
senses
his
head
reeling
and
a
tingling
within
him
as
though
every
fibre
of
his
being
were
suddenly
stimulated
into
a
new
activity
well
my
gawd
vivian
gasped
what
they
doin
to
us
now
the
three
of
them
had
been
warned
by
a
voice
through
the
doorslide
so
that
they
sat
together
on
one
of
the
couches
waiting
for
what
would
happen
this
i
wish
they
would
do
it
franklin
muttered
damn
them
i
want
to
get
out
of
here
fear
seemed
to
be
franklin
chief
emotion
now
fear
and
a
petty
sense
of
personal
outrage
that
all
this
could
be
done
to
him
against
his
will
often
when
lee
and
the
girl
were
at
the
window
franklin
had
sat
brooding
staring
at
his
feet
easy
lee
said
it
evidently
wo
hurt
us
we
started
in
the
globe
and
everything
in
it
is
getting
larger
weird
the
grey
metal
walls
of
the
room
were
glowing
now
with
some
strange
current
which
suffused
them
the
starlight
from
the
mingled
with
an
opalescent
sheen
from
the
glowing
walls
it
was
like
an
aura
bathing
the
room
an
aura
which
seemed
to
penetrate
every
smallest
of
lee
body
stimulating
it
vaguely
lee
could
fathom
how
it
was
accomplished
his
mind
went
back
to
many
scientific
articles
he
had
read
on
the
theory
of
it
only
theory
those
imaginative
scientific
pedants
had
considered
it
and
now
it
was
a
reality
upon
him
he
recalled
the
learned
phrases
the
writers
had
used
the
of
in
all
the
universe
the
inherent
factors
which
govern
the
state
of
matter
yield
most
readily
to
a
change
an
electronic
charge
a
current
perhaps
akin
to
but
certainly
not
identical
with
electricity
would
change
the
state
of
all
organic
and
inorganic
substances
a
rapid
duplication
of
the
fundamental
entities
within
the
electrons
and
electrons
themselves
so
unsubstantial
mere
whirlpools
of
nothingness
a
rapid
duplication
of
the
fundamental
whirlpools
that
would
add
size
the
complete
substance
with
shape
unaltered
would
grow
larger
all
just
theory
but
here
now
it
was
brought
to
an
accomplished
fact
within
himself
lee
could
feel
it
but
as
yet
he
could
not
see
it
the
glowing
room
and
everything
in
it
was
so
weirdly
luminous
there
was
no
alteration
in
shape
these
objects
the
figure
of
vivian
beside
him
and
the
pallid
frightened
franklin
relative
to
each
other
they
were
no
different
from
before
and
the
vast
panorama
of
starry
universe
beyond
the
the
immense
distances
out
there
made
any
as
yet
unperceivable
but
the
had
begun
there
was
no
question
of
it
with
his
senses
steadying
lee
crossed
the
room
a
weird
feeling
of
lightness
was
upon
him
he
swayed
as
he
stood
before
the
little
line
of
dials
in
the
five
hundred
thousand
miles
from
earth
more
than
twice
the
distance
of
the
moon
the
globe
had
gone
that
far
with
accelerating
velocity
so
that
now
the
pointers
marked
a
hundred
thousand
miles
an
hour
out
beyond
the
moon
heading
for
the
of
mars
now
the
pointers
were
stirring
unit
one
the
size
this
globe
had
been
as
it
rested
on
earth
fifty
feet
in
height
and
some
thirty
feet
at
its
bulge
already
that
unit
was
two
a
globe
which
if
it
were
on
earth
would
be
a
hundred
feet
high
and
lee
himself
he
would
be
a
giant
more
than
twelve
feet
tall
now
he
stood
staring
at
the
dials
for
a
moment
or
two
that
little
pointer
of
the
first
of
the
dials
was
creeping
around
an
acceleration
another
moment
and
it
had
touched
unit
four
a
two
hundred
foot
globe
and
lee
if
he
had
been
on
earth
would
already
be
a
towering
human
nearly
feet
in
height
behind
him
he
heard
franklin
suddenly
muttering
if
only
i
could
change
without
everything
else
changing
damn
them
all
what
i
could
do
you
nuts
vivian
said
i
do
see
anything
growing
bigger
everything
here
jus
the
same
her
laugh
was
abruptly
hysterical
this
room
you
two
you
look
like
ghosts
say
maybe
all
dead
an
do
know
it
queerly
her
words
sent
a
shiver
through
lee
he
turned
stared
blankly
at
her
this
weird
thing
the
electronic
light
streaming
from
these
walls
had
a
stroboscopic
quality
the
girl
face
was
greenish
and
her
teeth
shone
phosphorescent
maybe
we
all
dead
and
do
know
it
lee
knew
that
this
thing
was
a
matter
of
cold
precise
logical
science
yet
who
shall
say
but
what
mysticism
is
not
mingled
with
science
a
thing
which
if
we
understood
it
thoroughly
would
be
as
logical
as
precise
as
the
mathematics
of
science
itself
death
who
shall
say
what
of
actuality
death
may
be
a
leaving
of
the
mortal
shell
a
departure
from
earthly
substance
a
new
state
of
being
surely
some
of
those
elements
were
here
now
and
logically
why
could
there
not
be
a
state
of
being
not
all
death
but
only
with
some
of
its
elements
i
i
do
like
this
franklin
suddenly
squealed
on
the
couch
he
sat
hunched
trembling
something
wrong
here
lee
damn
you
lee
do
you
feel
it
lee
tried
to
smile
calmly
feel
what
we
not
not
alone
here
franklin
stammered
not
just
you
and
vivian
and
me
something
else
is
here
something
you
ca
see
but
you
can
almost
feel
an
i
do
like
it
a
presence
was
there
indeed
something
else
here
of
which
now
in
this
new
state
of
being
they
were
vaguely
aware
something
like
a
fellow
voyager
making
this
weird
journey
with
them
lee
heart
was
so
wildly
beating
that
it
seemed
smothering
him
unit
ten
twenty
a
hundred
with
steady
acceleration
the
lowest
pointer
was
whirling
and
the
one
above
it
was
moving
the
globe
was
five
thousand
feet
high
now
and
on
earth
lee
would
have
been
a
monstrous
titan
over
six
hundred
feet
tall
a
globe
and
humans
in
that
tremendous
size
the
very
weight
of
them
in
a
moment
more
of
this
growth
would
disarrange
the
rotation
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
and
then
abruptly
lee
found
himself
envisaging
the
monstrous
globe
out
here
in
space
a
thing
to
disarrange
the
mechanics
of
all
the
celestial
universe
in
an
hour
or
two
with
this
acceleration
of
growth
the
globe
would
be
a
huge
meteorite
then
an
asteroid
he
stared
at
the
distance
dials
with
the
growth
had
come
an
immense
augmentation
of
velocity
a
hundred
thousand
miles
an
hour
that
had
been
accelerated
a
hundred
fold
now
ten
million
miles
an
hour
through
the
lee
gazed
mute
with
awe
the
was
beginning
to
show
far
down
and
to
one
side
the
crescent
earth
was
dwindling
mars
was
far
away
in
another
portion
of
its
orbit
the
moon
was
behind
the
earth
there
were
just
the
myriad
blazing
giant
worlds
of
the
stars
infinitely
remote
with
vast
distances
of
inky
void
between
them
and
now
there
was
a
visible
movement
to
the
stars
a
sort
of
shifting
movement
an
hour
a
day
a
week
who
shall
try
and
describe
what
lee
anthony
beheld
during
that
weird
outward
journey
for
a
brief
time
after
they
swept
past
the
orbit
of
mars
the
great
planets
of
jupiter
and
saturn
were
almost
in
a
line
ahead
of
the
plunging
expanding
globe
a
monstrous
thing
now
with
electronically
charged
so
that
it
plunged
onward
by
its
own
repellant
force
the
repellant
force
of
the
great
beneath
it
lee
stared
at
jupiter
a
world
with
its
red
spot
like
a
monster
single
glaring
eye
with
the
speed
of
light
jupiter
was
advancing
swinging
off
to
one
side
with
a
visible
flow
of
movement
and
dropping
down
into
the
lower
void
as
the
globe
went
past
it
yet
as
it
approached
visually
it
had
not
grown
larger
instead
there
was
only
a
steady
dwindling
a
dwindling
of
great
saturn
with
its
gorgeous
luminous
rings
came
next
these
approaching
planets
seeming
to
shrink
because
with
lee
expanding
viewpoint
everything
in
the
vast
scene
was
shrinking
great
distances
here
in
relation
to
the
giant
globe
were
dwindling
these
millions
of
miles
between
saturn
and
jupiter
had
shrunk
into
thousands
and
then
were
shrinking
to
hundreds
abruptly
with
a
startled
shock
to
his
senses
lee
viewpoint
changed
always
before
he
had
instinctively
conceived
himself
to
be
his
normal
six
foot
earthly
size
the
starry
universe
was
vast
beyond
his
conception
and
in
a
second
now
that
abruptly
was
altered
he
conceived
the
vehicle
as
of
actuality
it
was
a
globe
as
large
as
the
ball
of
saturn
itself
and
simultaneously
he
envisaged
the
present
reality
of
saturn
out
in
the
inky
blackness
it
hung
not
a
giant
ringed
world
millions
of
miles
away
but
only
a
little
ringed
ball
no
bigger
than
the
spaceship
a
ringed
ball
only
eight
or
ten
times
as
big
as
lee
himself
it
hung
there
for
an
instant
beside
them
only
a
mile
or
so
away
perhaps
and
as
it
went
past
with
both
distance
and
combining
now
it
shrank
with
amazing
rapidity
a
ball
only
as
big
as
this
room
then
no
larger
than
lee
it
hung
still
seemingly
no
further
away
than
before
and
then
in
a
few
minutes
more
a
mile
out
there
in
the
shrinking
distance
it
was
a
tiny
luminous
point
vanishing
beyond
his
vision
uranus
little
neptune
pluto
almost
too
far
away
in
its
orbit
to
be
seen
all
of
them
presently
were
dwindled
and
gone
lee
had
a
glimpse
of
the
solar
system
a
mere
bunch
of
lights
the
sun
was
a
tiny
spot
of
light
holding
its
little
family
of
tiny
planets
a
mother
hen
with
her
brood
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
lost
like
a
speck
of
among
the
giant
starry
worlds
another
day
that
is
a
day
as
it
would
have
been
on
earth
but
here
was
merely
a
progressing
of
human
existence
a
streaming
forward
of
human
consciousness
the
dial
pointers
were
all
in
movement
by
earth
standards
of
size
and
velocity
long
since
had
the
velocity
reached
and
passed
the
speed
of
light
lee
had
been
taught
his
colored
by
the
einstein
postulates
that
there
could
be
no
speed
greater
than
the
speed
of
light
by
earth
standards
perhaps
yes
the
globe
by
comparison
with
its
original
might
still
be
traveling
no
more
than
a
few
hundred
thousand
miles
an
hour
but
this
monster
a
thing
now
as
big
as
the
whole
solar
system
doubtless
was
speeding
through
a
in
a
moment
futile
figures
the
human
mind
can
grasp
nothing
of
the
vastness
of
space
to
lee
it
was
only
a
shrinking
inky
void
an
emptiness
crowded
with
whirling
little
worlds
all
dwindling
this
crowded
space
often
little
points
of
had
come
whirling
at
the
globe
colliding
bursting
into
of
fire
each
of
them
might
have
been
bigger
than
the
earth
there
was
a
time
when
it
seemed
that
beneath
the
globe
all
the
tiny
stars
were
shrinking
into
one
cluster
the
universe
all
congealed
down
there
into
a
blob
and
everywhere
else
there
was
just
nothingness
but
then
little
distant
glowing
nebulae
were
visible
luminous
floating
rings
alone
in
the
emptiness
distant
one
of
them
drifted
past
seemingly
only
a
few
hundred
feet
away
a
luminous
little
ring
of
the
passage
of
the
monstrous
globe
seemed
to
hurl
it
so
that
like
a
blown
smoke
ring
it
went
into
chaos
lost
its
shape
and
vanished
then
at
last
all
the
blobs
each
of
them
to
conception
a
monstrous
universe
all
were
dwindled
into
one
blob
down
to
one
side
of
lee
window
and
then
they
were
gone
just
darkness
now
darkness
and
soundless
emptiness
but
as
he
stared
at
intervals
through
another
long
night
of
his
human
consciousness
lee
seemed
to
feel
that
the
emptiness
out
there
was
dwindling
a
finite
emptiness
he
noticed
presently
that
the
pointers
had
stopped
their
movement
the
ultimate
size
of
the
globe
had
been
reached
the
figures
of
the
dials
were
meaningless
to
his
comprehension
the
velocity
was
meaningless
and
now
another
little
set
of
dials
were
in
operation
a
thousand
something
of
distance
there
was
a
meaningless
word
which
named
the
unit
a
thousand
if
he
had
been
in
his
former
size
the
pointer
marked
nine
hundred
in
a
moment
was
it
perhaps
the
distance
now
from
their
destination
vivian
was
beside
him
lee
what
gon
na
happen
to
us
wo
this
come
to
an
end
some
time
lee
you
wo
let
anybody
hurt
me
she
was
like
a
child
almost
always
clinging
to
him
now
and
suddenly
she
said
a
very
strange
thing
lee
i
been
thinkin
back
there
on
earth
i
was
doin
a
lot
of
things
that
maybe
were
pretty
rotten
for
his
money
for
instance
an
not
carin
much
what
i
had
to
do
to
get
it
she
gestured
at
the
sullen
franklin
who
was
sitting
on
the
couch
you
know
things
like
that
an
i
been
thinkin
you
suppose
when
we
get
where
we
goin
now
that
be
held
against
me
what
a
queer
thing
to
say
she
was
like
a
child
and
so
often
a
child
has
an
insight
into
that
which
is
hidden
from
those
more
mature
i
do
know
lee
muttered
from
the
couch
franklin
looked
up
moodily
whispering
about
me
again
i
know
you
are
damn
you
both
you
and
everybody
else
here
we
not
interested
in
you
vivian
said
oh
you
not
well
you
were
back
on
earth
i
not
good
enough
for
you
now
eh
he
better
because
he
big
big
and
strong
that
the
idea
well
if
i
ever
had
the
chance
do
be
silly
lee
said
the
sullen
franklin
was
working
himself
into
a
rage
lee
seemed
to
understand
franklin
better
now
a
weakling
inherently
with
a
complex
of
inferiority
the
vague
consciousness
of
it
lashing
him
into
baffled
anger
you
anthony
franklin
burst
out
do
think
you
been
fooling
me
you
can
put
it
over
that
fool
girl
but
not
me
i
onto
you
put
what
over
lee
said
mildly
that
you
do
know
anything
about
this
affair
or
these
men
who
got
us
you
do
know
who
they
are
do
you
no
do
you
lee
asked
franklin
jumped
to
his
feet
do
fence
with
me
by
god
if
i
was
bigger
i
smash
your
head
in
they
abducted
us
because
they
wanted
you
that
fellow
said
as
much
near
the
start
of
this
damned
trip
they
wo
talk
afraid
i
find
out
and
you
ca
guess
what
it
all
about
the
hell
you
ca
lee
said
nothing
but
there
was
a
little
truth
in
what
franklin
was
saying
of
course
those
things
that
the
dying
old
anna
green
had
told
him
surely
this
weird
voyage
had
some
connection
he
turned
away
went
back
to
the
window
there
was
a
sheen
now
a
vague
outline
of
something
vast
as
though
the
darkness
were
ending
at
a
great
wall
that
glowed
a
little
it
seemed
during
the
next
as
though
the
globe
might
have
turned
over
so
that
now
it
was
dropping
down
upon
something
tangible
dropping
floating
down
with
steadily
decreasing
velocity
descending
to
a
surface
the
sheen
of
glow
had
expanded
until
now
it
filled
all
the
lower
hemisphere
of
darkness
a
great
spread
of
surface
visually
coming
up
then
there
were
things
to
see
illumined
by
a
faint
to
which
color
was
coming
a
faint
pastel
color
that
seemed
a
why
why
vivian
murmured
say
it
beautiful
ai
it
it
looks
like
fairyland
or
heaven
it
does
do
it
lee
yes
lee
murmured
like
like
the
rasped
the
voice
of
one
of
their
captors
said
we
will
arrive
soon
we
can
trust
you
there
must
be
no
fighting
you
can
trust
us
lee
said
it
was
dark
in
the
little
curving
corridor
of
the
globe
where
with
silent
robed
figures
around
them
they
stood
while
the
globe
gently
landed
then
they
were
pushed
forward
out
through
the
exit
port
the
new
realm
the
world
beyond
what
was
it
to
lee
anthony
then
came
the
feeling
that
there
was
a
precise
scientific
explanation
of
it
of
course
and
yet
beyond
all
that
pedantry
of
science
he
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
something
else
perhaps
a
place
that
a
man
might
mould
by
his
dreams
a
place
that
would
be
what
a
man
made
of
it
from
that
which
was
within
himself
solemn
with
awe
he
went
with
his
companions
slowly
down
the
incline
chapter
iii
of
we
wish
nothing
of
you
the
man
said
save
that
you
accept
from
us
what
we
have
to
offer
you
are
hungry
you
will
let
us
bring
you
food
it
was
a
simple
rustic
room
to
which
they
had
been
brought
a
room
in
a
house
seemingly
of
plaited
straw
crude
furnishings
were
here
table
and
chairs
of
earth
fashion
padded
with
stuffed
mats
woven
matting
was
on
the
floor
through
a
broad
latticed
window
the
faint
outside
like
a
soft
pastel
twilight
filtered
in
tinting
the
room
with
a
gentle
glow
thin
drapes
at
the
window
stirred
in
a
breath
of
breeze
a
warm
wind
from
the
hills
scented
with
the
vivid
blooms
which
were
everywhere
it
had
been
a
brief
walk
from
the
lee
had
seen
what
seemed
a
little
village
stretching
off
among
the
trees
there
had
been
people
crowding
to
see
the
strangers
men
women
and
children
in
simple
crude
peasant
garb
brief
garments
that
revealed
their
bodies
they
babbled
with
strange
unintelligible
words
crowding
forward
until
the
robed
men
from
the
globe
shoved
them
away
it
was
a
pastoral
peaceful
scene
a
little
drowsing
in
the
warm
rosy
twilight
out
by
the
river
there
were
fields
where
men
stood
at
their
simple
agricultural
implements
stood
at
rest
staring
curiously
at
the
commotion
in
the
village
and
still
lee
captors
would
say
nothing
merely
drew
them
forward
into
this
room
then
all
of
them
left
save
one
he
had
doffed
his
robe
now
he
was
an
old
man
with
long
hair
to
the
base
of
his
neck
he
stood
smiling
his
voice
with
the
english
words
queerly
pronounced
was
gentle
but
with
a
firm
finality
of
command
my
name
is
arkoh
he
said
i
am
to
see
that
you
are
made
comfortable
this
house
is
yours
there
are
several
rooms
so
that
you
may
do
in
them
as
you
wish
thank
you
lee
said
but
you
can
certainly
understand
i
have
asked
many
questions
and
never
had
any
answers
if
you
wish
to
talk
to
me
alone
that
will
come
presently
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
be
worried
we
not
worried
franklin
burst
out
we
fed
up
with
this
highhanded
stuff
you
answer
questions
now
what
i
demand
to
know
is
why
take
it
easy
lee
warned
franklin
had
jumped
to
his
feet
he
flung
off
lee
hand
do
make
me
laugh
i
know
you
one
of
them
everything
about
you
is
a
fake
you
got
us
into
this
so
you
would
bring
strife
here
from
your
earth
arkoh
voice
cut
in
like
a
cleaving
through
franklin
bluster
that
is
not
permissible
please
do
not
make
it
necessary
that
there
should
be
violence
here
he
stood
motionless
but
before
his
gaze
franklin
relaxed
into
an
incoherent
muttering
thank
you
arkoh
said
i
shall
send
you
the
food
he
turned
and
left
the
room
vivian
collapsed
into
a
chair
she
was
trembling
well
my
gawd
what
is
all
this
lee
that
old
man
with
his
gentle
voice
he
looked
like
if
you
crossed
him
you
be
dead
not
that
he
hurt
you
it
would
be
would
be
something
else
you
talk
like
an
ass
franklin
said
you
gone
crazy
and
i
blame
you
this
damned
weird
thing
for
all
that
old
man
smooth
talk
we
just
prisoners
here
look
outside
that
window
it
was
a
little
garden
drowsing
in
the
twilight
a
man
stood
watching
the
window
and
as
lee
went
to
the
lattice
he
could
see
others
like
guards
outside
the
man
who
brought
their
simple
food
was
a
stalwart
fellow
in
a
draped
garment
of
brown
plaited
fibre
his
black
hair
hung
thick
about
his
ears
he
laid
out
the
food
in
silence
what
name
franklin
demanded
i
am
groff
and
you
wo
talk
either
i
suppose
look
here
i
can
make
it
worth
your
while
to
talk
everyone
has
all
he
needs
here
there
is
nothing
that
you
need
give
us
is
there
you
just
give
me
a
chance
and
i
show
you
no
one
has
all
he
needs
or
all
he
wants
groff
did
not
answer
but
as
he
finished
placing
the
food
and
left
the
room
it
seemed
to
lee
that
he
shot
a
queer
look
back
at
franklin
a
look
so
utterly
incongruous
that
it
was
startling
franklin
saw
it
and
chuckled
well
at
least
there
one
person
here
who
not
so
damn
weird
that
it
gives
you
the
creeps
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
lee
said
with
sudden
impulse
he
lowered
his
voice
franklin
listen
there
are
a
few
things
that
perhaps
i
can
tell
you
things
that
i
can
guess
that
vivian
senses
i
do
want
to
hear
your
explanation
it
would
be
just
a
lot
of
damn
lies
anyway
all
right
perhaps
it
would
we
soon
know
i
imagine
let
eat
vivian
said
i
hungry
even
if
i
am
scared
to
lee
it
seemed
that
the
weird
mystery
here
was
crowding
upon
them
as
though
here
in
this
dim
room
momentous
things
were
waiting
to
reveal
themselves
a
strange
emotion
was
upon
lee
anthony
a
sort
of
tense
eagerness
certainly
it
was
not
fear
certainly
it
seemed
impossible
that
there
could
be
anything
here
of
which
he
should
be
afraid
again
his
mind
went
back
to
old
anna
green
and
what
she
had
told
him
of
his
grandfather
how
far
away
how
long
ago
that
had
been
and
yet
was
anna
green
far
away
now
something
of
her
had
seemed
always
to
be
with
him
on
that
long
weird
voyage
from
the
infinite
smallness
and
pettiness
of
earth
to
this
realm
out
beyond
the
stars
and
more
than
ever
now
somehow
lee
seemed
aware
of
her
presence
here
in
this
quiet
room
occultism
he
had
always
told
himself
that
surely
he
was
no
mystic
a
practical
fellow
who
could
understand
science
when
it
was
taught
him
but
certainly
never
could
give
credence
to
mysticism
the
dead
are
dead
and
the
living
are
alive
and
between
them
is
a
gulf
an
abyss
of
nothingness
now
he
found
himself
wondering
were
all
those
people
on
earth
who
claimed
to
feel
the
presence
of
dead
loved
ones
near
them
were
those
people
just
straining
their
fancy
just
comforting
themselves
with
what
they
wished
to
believe
or
was
the
scoffer
himself
the
fool
and
if
that
could
be
so
on
earth
why
could
not
this
strange
realm
be
of
such
a
quality
that
an
awareness
of
those
who
have
passed
from
life
would
be
the
normal
thing
who
shall
say
that
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death
are
unscientific
was
it
not
rather
that
they
embraced
those
gaps
of
science
not
yet
understood
mysteries
which
if
only
we
could
understand
them
would
be
mysteries
no
longer
lee
had
left
the
table
and
again
was
standing
at
the
latticed
window
beyond
which
the
drowsing
little
garden
lay
silent
and
empty
now
the
guard
who
had
been
out
here
had
moved
further
away
his
figure
was
a
blob
near
a
flowered
thicket
at
the
house
corner
and
suddenly
lee
was
aware
of
another
figure
there
was
a
little
splashing
fountain
near
the
garden
center
a
rill
of
water
which
came
down
a
little
embankment
and
splashed
into
a
pool
where
the
rose
light
shimmered
on
the
ripples
the
figure
was
sitting
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
a
slim
young
girl
in
a
brief
dress
like
a
drape
upon
her
she
sat
half
reclining
on
the
bank
by
the
shimmering
water
with
her
long
hair
flowing
down
over
her
shoulders
and
a
lock
of
it
trailing
in
the
pool
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
she
was
gazing
into
the
water
then
as
the
light
which
tinted
her
graceful
form
seemed
to
intensify
he
saw
that
she
was
staring
at
him
it
seemed
as
though
both
of
them
for
that
moment
were
breathless
with
a
strange
emotion
awakened
in
them
by
the
sight
of
each
other
and
then
slowly
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
still
gazing
at
lee
she
came
slowly
forward
with
her
hair
dangling
framing
her
small
oval
face
the
glow
in
the
tinted
her
features
it
was
a
face
of
girlhood
almost
mature
a
face
with
wonderment
on
it
now
he
knew
that
he
was
smiling
then
a
few
feet
from
the
window
she
stopped
and
said
shyly
you
are
lee
anthony
yes
i
am
aura
when
you
have
finished
eating
i
am
to
take
you
to
him
to
him
yes
the
one
of
our
guidance
he
bade
me
bring
you
her
soft
voice
was
musical
to
her
quite
obviously
the
english
was
a
foreign
tongue
i
ready
lee
said
i
finished
one
of
her
slim
bare
arms
went
up
with
a
gesture
from
the
corner
of
the
little
house
the
guard
there
turned
came
inside
lee
turned
to
the
room
the
guard
entered
you
are
to
come
he
said
so
we
just
stay
here
prisoners
franklin
muttered
he
and
vivian
were
blankly
staring
as
lee
was
led
away
then
in
a
moment
he
was
alone
beside
the
girl
who
had
come
for
him
silently
they
walked
out
into
the
glowing
twilight
along
a
little
woodland
path
with
the
staring
people
and
the
rustic
nestling
dwellings
blurring
in
the
distance
behind
them
a
little
line
of
wooded
hills
lay
ahead
the
sky
was
like
a
dark
vault
empty
the
pastel
light
on
the
ground
seemed
inherent
to
the
trees
and
the
rocks
it
streamed
out
like
a
faint
radiation
from
everywhere
and
then
as
lee
gazed
up
into
the
abyss
of
the
heavens
suddenly
it
seemed
as
though
very
faintly
he
could
make
out
a
tiny
patch
of
stars
just
one
small
cluster
high
overhead
the
universe
you
came
from
aura
said
yes
the
crown
of
her
tresses
as
she
walked
beside
him
was
at
his
shoulder
he
gazed
down
at
her
to
whom
are
you
taking
me
it
seems
that
i
could
guess
i
was
told
not
to
talk
of
that
well
all
right
is
it
far
no
a
little
walk
just
to
that
nearest
hill
again
they
were
silent
my
earth
he
said
presently
do
you
know
much
about
it
a
little
i
have
been
told
it
seems
so
far
away
to
me
now
she
gazed
up
at
him
she
was
smiling
is
it
to
me
it
seems
quite
close
she
gestured
just
up
there
it
seemed
far
to
you
i
suppose
that
was
because
you
were
so
small
for
so
long
coming
here
like
a
man
the
size
of
an
ant
trying
to
walk
ten
miles
of
course
it
would
be
a
monstrous
trip
but
if
that
man
were
steadily
to
grow
larger
as
he
progressed
he
would
cover
the
distance
very
quickly
well
lee
said
i
suppose
i
can
understand
that
you
were
born
here
aura
yes
of
course
your
world
here
what
is
it
like
she
gazed
up
at
him
as
though
surprised
you
have
seen
it
it
is
just
a
simple
little
place
we
have
not
so
many
people
here
in
the
village
and
about
that
many
more
those
who
live
in
the
hills
close
around
here
you
mean
that
all
just
this
village
just
a
few
thousand
people
oh
there
are
others
of
course
other
groups
like
ours
i
guess
out
in
the
forests
everywhere
in
all
the
forests
maybe
her
gesture
toward
the
distant
glowing
wooded
horizons
was
vague
we
have
never
tried
to
find
out
why
should
we
wherever
they
are
they
have
all
that
they
need
or
want
so
have
we
the
thing
was
so
utterly
simple
he
pondered
it
and
you
you
very
happy
here
her
wide
eyes
were
childlike
why
yes
of
course
why
not
why
should
not
everyone
be
happy
well
he
said
there
are
things
yes
i
have
heard
of
them
things
on
your
earth
which
the
humans
create
for
themselves
but
that
is
very
silly
we
do
not
have
them
here
surely
he
could
think
of
no
retort
to
such
childlike
faith
her
faith
how
horribly
criminal
it
would
be
to
destroy
it
a
priceless
thing
human
happiness
to
be
created
out
of
the
faith
that
it
was
the
normal
thing
he
realized
that
his
heart
was
pounding
as
though
now
things
which
had
been
dormant
within
him
all
his
life
were
coming
out
clamoring
now
for
recognition
and
then
out
of
another
silence
he
murmured
aura
you
taking
me
to
my
grandfather
are
you
he
came
here
from
earth
and
then
he
sent
back
there
to
get
me
yes
she
admitted
so
you
know
it
but
i
was
instructed
to
all
right
we
wo
talk
of
it
and
he
told
you
about
me
yes
she
agreed
shyly
she
caught
her
breath
as
she
added
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
a
long
time
shyly
she
gazed
up
at
him
the
had
blown
her
hair
partly
over
her
face
her
hand
brushed
it
away
so
that
her
gaze
met
his
i
hoped
you
would
be
well
like
you
are
she
added
oh
he
said
awkwardly
well
thanks
and
you
she
murmured
out
of
another
little
silence
you
i
hope
i
have
disappointed
you
i
am
the
way
you
want
like
you
wished
what
a
weird
thing
to
say
he
smiled
not
ever
having
heard
of
you
aura
i
ca
exactly
say
that
i
he
checked
himself
was
she
what
he
had
wished
why
yes
surely
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
in
his
dreams
all
his
life
vaguely
picturing
something
like
this
for
lee
anthony
i
guess
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
he
agreed
no
you
disappointed
me
aura
you
you
are
he
could
find
no
words
to
say
it
we
are
almost
there
she
said
he
will
be
very
happy
to
have
you
come
he
is
a
very
good
man
lee
the
one
we
think
of
the
most
goodness
and
wiseness
to
guide
us
all
the
path
had
led
them
up
a
rocky
defile
with
gnarled
little
trees
growing
between
the
crags
ahead
the
hillside
rose
up
in
a
broken
rocky
cliff
there
was
a
door
like
a
small
tunnel
entrance
a
woman
in
a
long
white
robe
was
by
the
door
he
is
here
aura
said
young
anthony
you
go
in
silently
they
passed
her
the
tunnel
entrance
glowed
with
the
pastel
radiance
from
the
rocks
the
radiance
was
a
soft
blob
of
color
ahead
of
them
you
will
find
that
he
can
not
move
now
aura
whispered
you
will
sit
by
his
bed
and
talk
softly
you
mean
he
ill
well
what
you
would
call
paralysis
he
can
not
move
only
his
lips
his
eyes
he
will
be
gone
from
us
soon
so
that
then
he
can
only
be
unseen
a
visitor
her
whisper
trailed
off
lee
heart
was
pounding
seeming
to
thump
in
his
throat
as
aura
led
him
silently
forward
it
was
a
draped
little
room
breathless
lee
stared
at
a
couch
a
thin
old
figure
lying
there
a
frail
man
with
white
hair
that
framed
his
wrinkled
face
it
was
a
face
that
was
smiling
its
sunken
burning
eyes
glowing
with
a
new
intensity
the
lips
moved
a
faint
old
voice
murmured
and
you
you
are
lee
yes
grandfather
he
went
slowly
forward
and
sat
on
the
bedside
chapter
iv
to
lee
after
a
moment
his
grandfather
seemed
not
but
just
a
frail
old
man
paralyzed
into
almost
complete
immobility
lying
here
almost
pathetically
happy
to
have
his
grandson
at
last
with
him
an
old
man
with
nothing
of
the
mystic
about
him
an
old
man
who
had
been
unknown
to
the
savants
of
his
earth
perhaps
the
greatest
scientist
among
them
quietly
with
pride
welling
in
him
lee
held
the
wasted
numbed
hand
of
his
grandfather
and
listened
phineas
anthony
the
scientist
after
many
years
of
research
spending
his
own
private
fortune
he
had
evolved
the
secret
of
solved
the
intricate
problems
of
spaceflight
and
combining
the
two
had
produced
that
little
vehicle
a
man
of
science
and
perhaps
more
than
that
as
old
anna
green
had
said
perhaps
he
was
a
man
inspired
a
man
following
his
dreams
his
convictions
convinced
that
somewhere
in
god
great
creation
of
things
that
are
there
must
be
an
existence
freed
of
those
things
by
which
man
himself
so
often
makes
human
life
a
tortured
hell
and
something
led
me
here
lee
the
gentle
old
voice
was
saying
perhaps
not
such
a
coincidence
on
this
great
inner
surface
of
gentle
light
and
gentle
warmth
with
nature
offering
nothing
against
which
one
must
strive
there
must
be
many
groups
of
simple
people
like
these
they
have
no
thought
of
evil
there
is
nothing
no
one
to
teach
it
to
them
if
i
had
not
landed
here
i
think
i
would
have
found
much
the
same
thing
almost
anywhere
else
on
the
inner
surface
the
inner
surface
i
do
understand
grandfather
a
conception
a
reality
here
that
was
numbing
in
its
vastness
this
was
the
concave
inner
surface
doubtless
deep
within
the
atom
of
some
material
substance
a
little
empty
space
here
surrounded
by
solidity
and
that
lee
murmured
then
that
little
space
is
our
abyss
yes
of
course
the
stars
as
we
call
them
from
here
you
could
call
them
tiny
particles
like
electrons
whirling
all
of
them
in
this
little
void
with
good
eyesight
you
can
sometimes
see
them
there
i
did
and
to
this
viewpoint
which
lee
had
now
so
gigantic
compared
to
earth
all
the
universe
was
a
void
here
of
what
old
anthony
considered
would
be
perhaps
eight
or
ten
thousand
miles
a
void
to
lee
now
was
itself
of
no
greater
volume
than
the
earth
had
been
to
him
before
silently
he
pondered
it
this
inner
surface
not
much
bigger
to
him
now
than
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
to
its
humans
suddenly
he
felt
small
infinitely
tiny
out
here
beyond
the
stars
he
was
only
within
the
atom
of
something
larger
a
human
partly
on
his
way
emerging
outward
it
gave
him
a
new
vague
conception
as
though
now
because
he
was
partly
emerged
the
creator
was
giving
him
a
new
insight
surely
in
this
simple
form
of
existence
humans
were
totally
unaware
of
what
evil
could
be
was
not
this
a
higher
form
of
life
than
down
there
on
his
tiny
earth
the
conception
numbed
him
with
awe
you
see
lee
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
having
you
become
a
man
to
having
you
here
old
anthony
was
saying
as
he
lay
so
utterly
motionless
only
his
voice
his
face
his
eyes
seemed
alive
it
was
an
amazingly
expressive
old
face
radiant
transfigured
i
shall
not
be
here
long
you
see
and
when
i
have
gone
on
when
i
can
only
come
back
here
as
a
visitor
like
anna
green
you
have
been
aware
of
her
lee
yes
grandfather
yes
i
think
i
have
the
awareness
is
more
acute
here
than
it
was
back
on
earth
a
very
comforting
thing
lee
i
was
saying
i
want
you
here
these
people
so
simple
you
might
almost
think
them
childlike
they
need
someone
to
guide
them
the
one
who
did
that
just
as
i
came
was
dying
maybe
maybe
that
is
what
led
me
here
so
now
i
need
you
it
welled
in
lee
with
an
awe
and
a
feeling
suddenly
of
humbleness
and
of
his
own
inadequacy
so
that
he
murmured
but
grandfather
i
would
do
my
best
but
surely
i
think
it
will
be
given
you
the
ability
and
i
been
thinking
lee
if
only
some
time
it
might
be
possible
to
show
them
on
earth
lee
had
been
aware
that
he
and
old
anthony
were
alone
here
when
lee
entered
aura
had
at
once
withdrawn
now
interrupting
his
faint
gentle
voice
there
was
a
commotion
outside
the
underground
apartment
the
sound
of
women
startled
cries
and
aura
voice
then
aura
burst
in
breathless
pale
with
her
hair
flying
and
on
her
face
and
in
her
eyes
a
terror
so
incongruous
that
lee
heart
went
cold
he
gasped
aura
aura
what
is
it
this
terrible
thing
that
man
who
came
with
you
that
man
franklin
he
talked
with
groff
some
evil
spell
to
put
upon
groff
it
could
only
have
been
that
lee
seized
her
what
do
you
mean
talk
slower
groff
the
man
who
served
us
that
meal
yes
groff
and
two
of
the
men
who
were
to
guard
there
what
that
man
said
to
them
did
to
them
and
when
old
arkoh
found
it
out
he
opposed
them
her
voice
was
drab
with
stark
horror
so
new
an
emotion
that
it
must
have
confused
her
so
that
now
she
just
stood
trembling
child
come
here
come
here
over
to
me
old
anthony
voice
summoned
her
now
talk
more
slowly
try
and
think
what
you
want
to
tell
us
what
happened
oh
i
saw
old
arkoh
him
whom
i
love
so
much
who
always
has
been
so
good
to
me
to
us
all
i
saw
him
lying
there
on
the
floor
words
so
unnatural
here
that
they
seemed
to
reverberate
through
the
little
with
echoes
that
jostled
and
muttered
like
alien
menacing
things
which
had
no
right
here
and
yet
were
here
you
saw
him
lying
there
lee
prompted
yes
his
throat
with
red
blood
running
out
of
it
where
they
had
cut
him
and
he
was
dying
he
died
while
i
stood
there
the
first
murder
a
thing
so
unnatural
old
anthony
stared
for
an
instant
mute
at
the
girl
who
now
had
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
she
trembled
against
lee
killed
him
lee
murmured
on
anthony
face
there
was
wonderment
disillusion
and
then
bitterness
so
this
is
what
comes
to
us
from
earth
lying
so
helpless
old
anthony
could
only
murmur
that
now
lee
must
do
what
he
could
your
own
judgement
my
son
do
what
you
can
to
meet
this
the
sunken
burning
eyes
of
the
old
man
flashed
if
there
must
be
violence
here
let
it
be
so
violence
for
that
which
is
right
grandfather
yes
that
miserable
cowardly
murderer
to
meet
force
with
force
surely
even
in
a
world
of
ideals
there
is
no
other
way
with
his
fists
clenched
lee
ran
from
the
frightened
women
scattered
before
him
at
its
entrance
where
had
franklin
gone
that
fellow
groff
and
two
or
three
of
the
guards
had
gone
with
him
cynicism
swept
lee
he
remembered
the
look
groff
had
flung
at
franklin
even
here
in
this
realm
because
it
was
peopled
by
humans
evil
passions
could
brood
groff
indeed
must
have
been
planning
something
and
he
had
seen
in
franklin
a
ready
helper
a
man
from
earth
whom
groff
very
well
may
have
thought
would
be
more
resourceful
more
experienced
in
the
ways
of
violence
than
himself
this
realm
where
everyone
had
all
of
happiness
that
he
could
want
human
perfection
of
existence
a
savage
laugh
of
irony
was
within
lee
as
he
thought
of
it
no
one
had
ever
held
out
the
offer
of
more
than
perfection
to
these
people
but
franklin
evidently
had
done
it
playing
upon
the
evil
which
must
lie
within
every
living
thing
no
matter
how
latent
it
may
be
awakening
in
those
guards
the
passion
of
cupidity
desire
for
something
better
than
they
had
now
what
had
happened
to
vivian
out
in
the
dimness
a
little
way
down
the
path
lee
found
himself
staring
off
toward
the
forest
where
the
village
lay
nestled
voices
of
the
frightened
people
came
wafting
through
the
night
silence
lee
lee
it
was
aura
behind
him
running
after
him
lee
wait
i
belong
with
you
you
know
that
he
gripped
her
that
girl
from
earth
that
vivian
she
was
with
franklin
what
happened
to
her
she
went
he
took
her
she
went
voluntarily
yes
the
people
saw
her
running
out
with
franklin
and
groff
and
the
other
men
oh
lee
what
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
he
stood
for
a
moment
dazed
confused
panting
his
fingers
twitching
if
only
he
could
get
a
grip
on
franklin
throat
and
so
vivian
went
too
that
was
a
laugh
girl
of
the
streets
pretty
worthless
on
earth
but
here
she
had
seemed
to
sense
what
this
realm
could
mean
aura
where
would
groff
be
likely
to
go
go
why
why
i
do
remember
groff
often
went
up
into
the
hills
he
never
said
why
would
they
have
any
weapons
weapons
her
eyes
widened
as
though
for
a
second
she
did
not
comprehend
weapons
you
mean
instruments
with
which
to
kill
people
no
how
could
there
be
but
a
knife
can
kill
a
knife
cut
old
throat
we
have
knives
in
the
houses
and
knives
that
are
used
for
the
harvests
she
had
turned
to
gaze
out
toward
the
glowing
hills
oh
lee
look
numbed
with
their
breath
catching
in
their
throats
they
stared
out
by
the
hills
a
man
figure
rose
up
monstrous
gigantic
figure
franklin
he
stood
beside
the
little
hill
with
a
hand
on
its
top
his
huge
bulk
dwarfing
it
franklin
a
titan
his
head
and
shoulders
looming
monstrously
against
the
inky
blackness
of
the
sky
chapter
v
of
aura
you
think
you
know
where
groff
may
have
gone
those
times
he
went
out
into
the
hills
yes
i
think
so
lee
that
giant
i
think
now
i
understand
what
must
have
happened
the
giant
shape
of
franklin
a
mile
or
two
from
them
had
stood
for
a
moment
and
then
had
receded
vanished
momentarily
as
he
moved
backward
behind
the
hills
lee
and
aura
stunned
still
stood
beside
the
little
rocky
path
lee
mind
was
a
turmoil
of
confusion
with
only
the
knowledge
that
he
must
do
something
now
quickly
there
were
no
weapons
here
in
this
peaceful
little
realm
four
or
five
of
these
madmen
villains
what
need
had
they
of
weapons
the
monstrous
power
of
size
the
thought
of
it
struck
at
lee
with
a
chill
that
seemed
turning
his
blood
to
ice
the
monster
that
franklin
had
become
with
a
size
like
that
he
could
scatter
death
with
his
naked
hands
i
remember
now
aura
was
gasping
there
was
a
time
when
your
grandfather
was
working
on
his
science
groff
was
helping
him
then
your
grandfather
taught
groff
much
working
at
what
it
was
never
said
then
your
grandfather
gave
it
up
he
had
decided
it
would
not
be
wise
here
some
individual
apparatus
with
the
principle
of
the
and
groff
had
gotten
the
secret
an
abnormality
here
groff
with
the
power
of
evil
latent
within
him
tempted
by
this
opportunity
what
could
he
have
hoped
to
accomplish
of
what
use
to
him
would
it
be
to
devastate
this
little
realm
bitter
irony
swept
lee
of
what
use
was
vast
personal
power
to
anyone
those
madmen
of
earth
history
with
their
lust
for
conquest
of
what
use
could
the
conquest
be
to
them
and
yet
they
had
plunged
on
he
realized
that
with
groff
there
could
have
been
a
wider
field
of
conquest
groff
had
heard
much
of
earth
with
the
power
of
size
here
he
could
master
this
realm
then
seize
the
go
with
it
to
earth
why
in
a
gigantic
size
there
he
and
a
few
villainous
companions
could
master
the
a
mad
dream
indeed
but
lee
knew
it
was
a
lustful
possibility
matched
by
many
in
earth
history
and
then
franklin
had
come
here
franklin
with
his
knowledge
of
earth
which
groff
would
need
franklin
with
his
inherent
feeling
of
inferiority
his
groping
desire
for
the
strength
and
power
of
size
what
an
opportunity
for
franklin
lee
heard
himself
saying
out
of
the
turmoil
of
his
thoughts
then
aura
out
there
in
the
hills
they
got
some
apparatus
of
course
which
his
words
were
stricken
away
from
somewhere
in
the
glowing
dimness
near
at
hand
there
was
a
groan
a
gasping
choking
groan
and
the
sound
of
something
falling
lee
over
there
aura
whispered
words
were
drab
with
horror
a
figure
which
had
been
staggering
among
the
rocks
near
them
had
fallen
they
rushed
to
it
vivian
she
was
trying
to
drag
herself
forward
her
hair
streaming
down
in
a
sodden
mass
was
matted
with
blood
her
pallid
face
was
her
neck
and
throat
were
a
welter
of
crimson
horror
beside
her
on
the
ground
lay
a
apparatus
of
grids
and
wires
a
metal
belt
a
skeleton
helmet
she
was
gripping
it
with
a
hand
dragging
it
with
her
vivian
vivian
oh
you
lee
thank
gawd
i
got
to
you
her
elbows
gave
way
her
head
and
shoulders
sank
to
the
rock
faintly
gasping
with
at
her
livid
lips
she
lay
motionless
but
her
glazing
eyes
gazed
up
at
lee
and
she
was
trying
to
smile
i
went
with
them
that
damned
franklin
he
thought
i
was
as
bad
as
him
her
faint
words
were
barely
audible
as
he
bent
down
to
her
just
want
to
tell
you
lee
you
perfectly
swell
i
guess
i
fell
for
you
did
i
that
over
now
just
wanted
you
to
know
it
anyway
one
of
the
damned
mechanisms
they
got
where
are
they
vivian
a
cave
not
very
far
from
here
down
that
little
ravine
just
ahead
they
in
there
four
or
five
of
them
getting
ready
to
blood
was
rattling
in
her
throat
choking
her
she
tried
horribly
to
cough
and
then
she
gasped
i
stole
this
mechanism
he
franklin
he
caught
me
slashed
me
he
thought
i
was
dead
i
guess
but
when
he
had
gone
i
got
this
mechanism
trying
to
get
to
you
her
choking
rattling
breath
again
gave
out
for
a
moment
she
lay
with
a
paroxysm
of
death
twitching
her
and
then
very
faintly
she
gasped
sort
of
nice
i
was
able
to
do
one
good
thing
anyhow
i
glad
of
that
the
paroxysm
ended
in
a
moment
her
white
lips
were
still
trying
to
smile
as
the
light
went
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
was
gone
trembling
lee
stood
up
with
the
mute
aura
clinging
to
him
it
was
fairly
obvious
how
the
weird
mechanism
should
be
adjusted
anklets
the
skeleton
helmet
of
electrodes
the
belt
around
his
waist
with
its
grids
tiny
dials
and
curved
battery
box
in
a
moment
he
stood
with
the
wires
strung
from
his
head
to
wrist
ankles
and
waist
there
seemed
but
one
little
control
switch
that
would
slide
over
a
metal
arc
of
intensity
contacts
oh
lee
what
what
are
you
going
to
do
aura
stood
white
with
terror
she
said
four
or
five
of
them
in
a
cave
near
here
perhaps
they
have
yet
gotten
large
down
in
a
little
ravine
lee
found
himself
running
forward
in
the
luminous
darkness
he
called
back
aura
you
stay
where
you
are
you
hide
until
it
over
then
in
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
there
was
no
thought
of
the
girl
there
was
only
the
vision
of
old
anthony
lying
back
there
so
helpless
his
burning
eyes
bitter
with
this
thing
which
had
so
horribly
come
to
his
little
realm
to
meet
force
with
force
was
the
only
answer
it
was
not
lee
plan
to
increase
his
size
for
a
moment
now
by
doing
that
almost
at
once
he
would
be
discovered
and
perhaps
there
were
still
four
or
five
of
the
murderers
still
not
giants
in
a
cave
nearby
the
dim
rocky
ravine
heavy
with
shadows
led
downward
he
came
to
a
tunnel
opening
advancing
more
cautiously
now
and
then
as
he
turned
an
angle
ahead
of
him
down
a
little
subterranean
declivity
a
luminous
cave
was
visible
groff
hideout
at
one
of
its
entrances
here
lee
stood
for
an
instant
gasping
the
five
men
were
here
groff
and
four
of
his
villainous
companions
the
five
bodies
lay
strewn
horribly
mangled
and
the
wreckage
of
their
mechanisms
was
strewn
among
them
so
obvious
what
had
happened
franklin
had
been
the
first
to
get
large
and
at
once
he
had
turned
on
them
franklin
the
weakling
who
dared
not
have
any
rivalry
and
now
franklin
was
outside
out
in
the
hills
a
raging
murderous
monster
for
a
moment
in
the
grisly
shambles
of
the
little
cave
lee
stood
transfixed
then
his
hand
was
fumbling
at
his
belt
he
shoved
the
small
there
was
a
shock
a
humming
a
reeling
of
his
senses
it
was
akin
to
what
he
had
felt
on
the
but
stronger
more
intense
now
for
an
instant
he
staggered
confused
the
wires
strung
on
him
were
glowing
he
could
feel
their
heat
weird
luminous
opalescence
streamed
from
them
it
bathed
him
strange
electrolite
radiance
that
permeated
every
minute
fibre
of
his
being
with
his
head
steadying
lee
suddenly
was
aware
of
movement
all
about
him
the
dim
outlines
of
the
were
shrinking
with
a
creeping
crawling
movement
and
roof
all
shrinking
dwindling
drawing
down
upon
him
under
his
feet
the
rocky
ground
seemed
hitching
forward
this
little
cave
in
a
moment
while
he
stood
shocked
into
immobility
the
cave
was
a
tiny
cell
down
by
his
feet
the
gruesome
mangled
corpses
were
the
size
of
children
the
bumped
his
head
he
must
get
out
of
here
the
realization
stabbed
him
why
in
another
moment
or
two
these
dark
walls
would
close
upon
him
then
with
instant
changing
viewpoint
he
saw
the
true
actuality
he
was
a
growing
giant
crouching
here
underground
a
giant
who
would
be
crushed
mangled
by
his
own
monstrous
growth
lee
turned
staggered
into
the
little
tunnel
shoved
his
way
out
the
walls
pressed
him
they
seemed
in
a
moment
to
close
after
him
as
he
gained
the
outer
glowing
darkness
there
was
only
a
narrow
slit
in
the
dwindling
cliff
to
mark
the
tunnel
entrance
lee
had
the
wits
to
crouch
in
a
fairly
open
space
as
he
stared
at
the
dwindling
trees
the
little
hills
all
shrinking
franklin
must
be
around
here
somewhere
franklin
doubtless
would
see
him
in
a
moment
and
then
as
lee
rose
up
franklin
saw
him
lee
put
a
hand
on
one
of
the
little
hills
at
his
waist
vaulted
it
so
that
he
faced
franklin
with
what
seemed
no
more
than
a
hundred
feet
between
them
for
that
second
franklin
was
transfixed
amazement
swept
his
face
his
muttering
was
audible
why
why
what
this
an
adversary
had
come
to
challenge
his
power
as
lee
bounded
forward
on
franklin
face
while
he
stood
transfixed
there
was
wonderment
disappointment
sudden
instinctive
fear
and
then
wild
rage
he
stooped
seized
a
boulder
hurled
it
at
the
oncoming
lee
it
missed
and
then
lee
was
on
him
seizing
him
franklin
body
had
not
been
enlarging
but
as
he
saw
lee
coming
his
hand
had
flung
his
switch
they
gripped
each
other
now
swaying
locked
together
staggering
franklin
still
was
more
than
head
and
shoulders
above
lee
his
huge
arms
with
amazing
power
in
them
bent
lee
backward
he
stumbled
went
down
with
franklin
on
him
got
you
damn
you
he
said
his
giant
hands
gripped
lee
throat
but
lee
was
aware
that
his
own
body
was
enlarging
faster
than
franklin
upon
which
the
had
only
now
started
to
act
if
lee
could
only
resist
just
a
little
bit
longer
his
groping
hands
beside
him
on
the
ground
seized
a
rock
monstrous
strangling
fingers
were
at
this
throat
his
breath
was
gone
his
head
roaring
then
he
was
aware
that
he
had
seized
a
rock
and
struck
it
up
into
franklin
face
for
a
second
the
hands
at
lee
throat
relaxed
he
gulped
in
air
desperately
broke
free
and
staggered
to
his
feet
but
franklin
was
up
as
quickly
the
tiny
forest
trees
crackled
under
lee
tread
as
again
he
hurled
himself
viciously
on
his
antagonist
at
the
head
of
the
distant
ravine
the
numbed
aura
crouched
alone
staring
out
at
the
hills
with
mute
horror
staring
at
the
two
monstrous
giants
slugging
it
out
franklin
was
the
larger
she
saw
lee
rise
up
and
with
a
hand
on
one
of
the
hills
vault
over
it
giants
that
loomed
against
the
sky
as
they
fronted
each
other
and
then
crashed
together
went
down
lee
was
underneath
dear
god
two
monstrous
bodies
lee
was
lying
with
a
ridge
of
crags
under
his
shoulders
franklin
voice
was
a
blurred
roar
of
triumph
in
the
distance
then
she
saw
lee
groping
hand
come
up
with
a
monstrous
fifty
foot
boulder
he
crashed
it
home
they
were
up
again
their
giant
staggering
lunges
had
carried
them
five
miles
from
her
they
were
almost
the
size
of
fighting
titans
the
blurred
distant
shapes
of
them
were
silhouettes
against
the
glow
of
the
sky
the
forest
out
there
was
crackling
under
their
tread
a
blurred
roar
of
breaking
mangled
trees
it
was
just
a
few
seconds
while
aura
stared
but
each
second
was
an
eternity
of
horror
then
one
of
the
monstrous
figures
was
toppling
a
great
boulder
had
crashed
on
franklin
head
he
had
broken
loose
staggering
while
lee
jumped
backward
and
crouched
for
just
a
second
the
towering
shape
of
the
stricken
franklin
loomed
up
in
the
sky
and
then
it
fell
crashing
forward
a
stream
was
there
and
the
body
fell
across
it
blocking
the
water
which
dammed
up
then
turned
aside
and
went
roaring
off
through
the
mangled
forest
lee
again
in
his
former
size
sat
at
old
anthony
bedside
with
aura
behind
him
the
news
of
the
combat
out
there
against
the
sky
had
come
to
anthony
the
excitement
of
it
too
much
for
his
faltering
old
heart
but
you
will
be
all
right
grandfather
the
thing
is
over
now
yes
all
right
of
course
lee
just
a
visitor
here
and
you
will
take
my
place
he
lay
now
as
old
anna
green
had
been
that
night
just
on
the
brink
lee
listen
to
me
those
mechanisms
the
lee
i
realize
now
there
is
no
possibility
that
we
could
help
earth
and
surely
it
could
only
bring
us
evil
here
what
we
have
found
here
do
you
see
back
on
earth
each
man
must
create
it
for
himself
within
himself
he
could
do
that
if
he
chose
and
so
you
you
must
disconnect
us
forever
yes
grandfather
and
i
guess
that
is
all
for
some
time
he
seemed
to
hover
on
the
brink
while
lee
and
aura
sitting
hand
in
hand
silently
watched
him
and
then
he
was
gone
the
last
of
the
mechanisms
irrevocably
was
smashed
the
little
line
of
vacuums
and
tubes
of
the
mechanisms
went
up
into
a
burst
of
opalescent
light
under
lee
grim
smashing
blows
then
silently
he
went
outside
and
joined
aura
behind
them
down
the
declivity
toward
the
village
the
people
were
gathering
he
was
silent
his
heart
pounding
with
emotion
as
he
faced
them
from
a
little
eminence
faced
them
and
heard
their
shouts
and
saw
their
arms
go
up
to
welcome
him
slowly
he
and
aura
walked
down
the
slope
toward
his
waiting
people
and
with
her
by
his
side
her
hand
in
his
lee
anthony
knew
then
that
he
had
found
fulfillment
the
attainment
of
that
which
is
within
every
heart
man
heritage
those
things
for
which
he
must
never
cease
to
strive
the
end
