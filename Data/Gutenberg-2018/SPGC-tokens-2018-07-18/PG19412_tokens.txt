darling
little

mother
things
have
happened
roman
candles
rockets
but
do
be
frightened
they
all
in
my
head
nevertheless
i
have
had
such
a
fourth
of
july
since
i
was
a
small
girl
in
america
and
stood
on
a
tin
pail
with
a
whole
pack
of
popping
away
underneath
is
it
funny
when
you
have
a
lot
to
tell
it
not
half
as
easy
to
write
a
letter
as
when
you
nothing
at
all
to
say
and
must
make
up
for
lack
of
matter
by
weaving
phrases
now
when
i
suffering
from
a
determination
of
too
many
words
to
my
pen
they
all
run
together
in
a
torrent
and
i
do
know
how
to
make
them
dribble
singly
to
a
beginning
i
think
i
talk
about
other
things
first
that
the
way
dear
dad
used
to
do
when
he
had
exciting
news
and
loved
to
dangle
it
over
our
heads
cherry
ripe
fashion
harping
on
the
weather
or
the
state
of
the
until
he
had
us
almost
dancing
with
impatience
yes
i
dwell
on
other
things
first
but
not
irrelevant
things
for
i
dwell
on
you
with
a
capital
y
which
is
the
only
proper
way
to
spell
you
and
you
are
never
irrelevant
you
could
be
whatever
was
happening
and
just
now
you
particularly
relevant
though
you
far
off
in
nice
cool
switzerland
for
presently
when
i
come
to
the
thing
i
going
to
ask
your
advice
it
very
convenient
having
a
french
mother
and
i
do
appreciate
dear
dad
yankee
cleverness
in
securing
you
in
the
family
you
say
sometimes
that
i
seem
all
american
and
that
you
glad
which
is
pretty
of
you
and
loyal
to
father
country
but
i
not
sure
whether
i
have
preferred
to
turn
out
more
like
my
mamma
you
so
somehow
as
frenchwomen
are
at
their
best
i
often
think
of
you
as
a
kind
of
pocket
combination
of
somebody
hundred
best
books
romance
practical
common
sense
poetry
wit
wisdom
fancy
cookery
etc
who
but
a
frenchwoman
could
combine
all
these
qualities
with
the
latest
thing
in
and
the
neatest
thing
in
stays
by
the
way
can
one
stays
be
a
quality
yes
if
one
french
even
half
french
i
believe
they
can
if
i
had
just
got
your
letter
of
day
before
yesterday
assuring
me
that
you
feel
strong
and
fresh
almost
as
if
you
never
been
ill
i
should
worry
you
for
advice
only
a
few
weeks
ago
if
suddenly
called
upon
for
it
you
have
shown
signs
of
nervous
prostration
i
shall
never
forget
my
horror
when
you
quite
uncontrollably
threw
a
spoon
at
philomene
who
came
to
ask
whether
we
would
have
soup
or
à
la
bonne
for
dinner
switzerland
was
an
inspiration
mine
i
flatter
myself
and
if
in
telling
me
that
you
in
robust
health
again
you
hinting
at
an
intention
to
sneak
back
to
blazing
paris
before
the
middle
of
september
you
do
know
your
spartan
daughter
all
that
american
in
me
rises
to
shout
no
and
you
need
think
that
your
child
is
bored
she
may
be
boiled
but
never
bored
far
from
it
as
you
shall
hear
school
breaks
up
breaks
into
little
blond
and
brunette
bits
which
will
blow
or
drift
off
to
their
respective
homes
and
i
should
by
this
time
be
packing
to
visit
the
despards
where
i
supposed
to
teach
mimi
young
voice
to
soar
as
compensation
for
holiday
hospitality
but
i
not
packing
because
ellaline
lethbridge
has
had
an
attack
of
nerves
you
wo
be
surprised
that
i
stopped
two
hours
to
hold
the
hand
and
to
stroke
the
hair
of
ellaline
i
done
that
before
when
she
had
a
pain
in
her
finger
or
a
cold
in
her
little
nose
and
sent
you
a
to
announce
that
i
could
get
home
for
dinner
and
our
happy
hour
together
no
you
wo
be
surprised
at
my
stopping
or
that
ellaline
should
have
an
attack
of
nerves
but
the
reason
for
the
attack
and
the
cure
she
wants
me
to
give
her
these
will
surprise
you
why
it
almost
as
hard
to
begin
after
all
as
if
i
had
been
working
industriously
up
to
it
for
three
pages
but
here
goes
dearest
you
often
said
and
i
agreed
with
you
or
else
it
was
the
other
way
round
that
i
could
ever
do
for
ellaline
lethbridge
would
be
too
much
that
she
could
ask
any
sacrifice
of
me
which
would
be
too
great
of
course
one
does
say
these
things
until
one
is
tested
but
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
but
of
course
you
believe
that
your
one
chick
has
a
glorious
voice
and
that
it
a
cruel
shame
she
should
be
doing
nothing
better
than
teaching
other
people
chicks
to
squall
whether
their
voices
are
worth
squalling
with
or
not
perhaps
though
mine
may
be
as
remarkable
an
organ
as
we
think
and
even
if
you
had
made
me
give
up
trying
for
light
opera
because
i
received
one
insult
with
a
capital
i
while
i
was
madame
larese
favourite
pupil
i
might
in
any
case
have
turned
into
a
great
prima
donna
i
was
rather
excited
and
amused
by
the
insult
myself
it
made
me
feel
so
interesting
and
so
like
a
heroine
of
romance
but
you
did
approve
of
it
and
we
had
some
hard
times
had
we
after
all
our
money
was
spent
in
and
lessons
for
me
from
the
immortal
larese
if
it
had
been
for
meeting
ellaline
and
ellaline
falling
a
victim
to
my
modest
charms
and
insisting
upon
madame
de
maluet
taking
me
as
a
teacher
of
singing
for
her
celebrated
finishing
school
for
young
ladies
what
would
have
become
of
us
dearest
with
you
so
delicate
me
so
young
and
both
of
us
so
poor
and
alone
in
a
big
world
i
really
do
know
and
you
often
said
you
did
of
course
if
it
had
been
for
ellaline
madame
richest
and
most
important
girl
persisting
as
she
did
in
her
imperious
way
madame
would
have
dreamed
of
engaging
a
young
girl
like
me
without
any
experience
as
a
teacher
no
matter
how
much
she
liked
my
voice
and
my
or
rather
larese
method
i
suppose
no
one
would
else
have
risked
me
so
i
certainly
do
owe
to
ellaline
and
nobody
but
ellaline
three
happy
and
fairly
prosperous
years
to
be
sure
because
of
my
position
at
madame
de
maluet
i
have
got
a
few
outside
pupils
but
that
indirectly
through
ellaline
too
is
it
i
reminding
you
of
all
these
things
so
that
you
may
have
it
clearly
before
your
mind
just
how
much
we
do
owe
ellaline
and
judge
whether
the
payment
she
now
asks
is
too
big
or
not
that
the
way
she
puts
it
not
coarsely
or
crudely
but
i
know
how
she
feels
she
sent
me
a
little
note
yesterday
while
i
was
giving
a
lesson
to
say
she
a
horrid
headache
had
gone
to
bed
and
would
i
come
to
her
room
as
soon
as
i
could
well
i
went
at
lunch
time
for
i
hated
to
keep
her
waiting
and
thought
i
could
eat
later
as
it
turned
out
i
did
eat
at
all
but
that
a
detail
she
had
on
a
perfectly
divine
nighty
with
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
no
girl
would
be
to
wear
such
a
thing
in
any
but
a
french
school
i
sure
even
if
she
were
a
parlour
boarder
and
her
hair
was
in
curly
waves
over
her
shoulders
altogether
she
looked
adorable
and
about
fourteen
years
old
instead
of
nearly
nineteen
as
she
is
you
do
show
your
headache
a
bit
said
i
i
have
got
one
said
she
then
she
explained
that
she
been
dying
for
a
chance
to
talk
with
me
alone
and
the
headache
was
the
only
thing
that
occurred
to
her
in
the
circumstances
she
does
mind
little
fibs
you
know
indeed
i
believe
she
rather
likes
them
because
any
intrigue
even
the
smallest
is
exciting
to
her
you
would
never
guess
anything
like
what
has
happened
that
dragon
of
a
guardian
of
hers
is
coming
back
at
last
from
bengal
where
he
been
governor
or
something
not
that
his
coming
would
matter
particularly
if
it
were
for
complications
but
there
are
several
the
most
formidable
of
which
is
a
young
man
the
young
man
is
a
french
young
man
and
his
name
is
honoré
du
guesclin
he
is
a
lieutenant
in
the
army
ellaline
mentioned
the
regiment
with
pride
but
i
forgotten
it
already
there
was
so
much
else
to
remember
and
she
says
he
is
descended
from
the
great
du
guesclin
she
met
him
at
madame
de
blanchemain
you
remember
the
madame
de
blanchemain
who
was
ellaline
dead
mother
most
intimate
friend
and
who
lives
at
st
cloud
ellaline
has
spent
all
her
holidays
there
ever
since
i
known
her
but
though
i
thought
she
told
me
everything
she
always
vowed
she
did
not
a
word
did
she
ever
breathe
about
a
young
man
having
risen
over
her
horizon
she
says
she
did
dare
because
i
so
queer
and
prim
about
some
things
i
not
am
i
but
now
she
driven
to
confess
as
she
in
the
most
awful
scrape
and
does
know
what
will
become
of
her
and
darling
honoré
unless
i
consent
to
help
them
she
met
him
only
last
easter
he
a
nephew
of
madame
de
blanchemain
it
seems
and
on
coming
back
from
foreign
service
in
algeria
or
somewhere
he
dutifully
paused
to
visit
his
relative
of
course
it
occurs
to
me
did
madame
de
blanchemain
write
and
intimate
that
she
would
have
in
the
house
a
pretty
little
heiress
with
no
inconvenient
relatives
unless
one
counts
the
dragon
but
ellaline
says
honoré
coming
was
quite
a
surprise
to
his
aunt
anyway
he
proposed
on
the
third
day
and
ellaline
accepted
him
it
was
by
moonlight
in
a
garden
so
who
can
blame
the
poor
child
i
always
thought
if
even
a
moderately
young
man
proposed
to
me
by
moonlight
in
a
garden
i
would
say
yes
yes
at
once
even
if
i
changed
my
mind
next
day
but
honoré
is
good
looking
she
has
his
picture
in
a
locket
with
a
moustache
i
mean
honoré
not
the
locket
and
so
ellaline
did
change
her
mind
next
day
not
a
word
was
said
to
madame
de
blanchemain
as
far
as
ellaline
knows
for
they
decided
that
considering
everything
they
must
keep
their
secret
and
eventually
run
away
to
be
married
because
honoré
is
poor
and
ellaline
an
heiress
guarded
by
a
dragon
well
through
letters
which
has
been
receiving
at
a
teashop
where
she
and
the
other
older
girls
go
rigorously
chaperoned
twice
a
week
it
was
arranged
to
do
the
deed
as
soon
as
school
should
close
and
if
they
could
have
carried
out
their
plan
ellaline
would
have
been
madame
du
guesclin
before
the
dragon
could
have
appeared
on
the
scene
breathing
fire
and
rattling
his
scales
they
were
going
to
scotland
to
be
married
honoré
idea
as
a
man
ca
legally
marry
a
girl
under
age
in
france
without
the
consent
of
everybody
concerned
once
she
got
away
with
him
and
had
had
any
kind
of
wedding
honoré
was
of
opinion
that
even
the
most
abandoned
dragon
would
be
thankful
to
sanction
a
marriage
according
to
french
law
so
it
could
all
be
done
over
again
properly
in
france
i
suppose
this
appealed
immensely
to
ellaline
love
of
intrigue
and
kittenish
tricksiness
generally
anyway
she
agreed
but
young
officers
propose
and
their
superiors
dispose
honoré
was
ordered
off
for
a
month
manoeuvres
before
he
could
even
ask
for
leave
and
as
known
to
be
destitute
of
near
relatives
he
could
rake
up
a
perishing
grandmother
as
an
excuse
what
he
did
try
i
do
know
but
anyhow
he
failed
and
the
running
away
had
to
be
put
off
that
was
blow
number
one
and
could
have
been
borne
without
blow
number
two
which
fell
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
it
said
that
the
wicked
guardian
was
just
about
to
start
for
home
and
intended
to
pick
up
ellaline
on
his
way
to
england
as
if
she
were
a
parcel
labelled
to
be
kept
till
called
for
she
certain
he
wo
let
her
marry
honoré
if
he
has
the
chance
to
say
no
beforehand
because
he
cares
nothing
about
her
happiness
or
about
her
or
anything
else
except
his
own
selfish
ambitions
of
course
ellaline
is
a
girl
who
takes
strong
prejudices
against
people
for
no
particular
reason
except
that
she
has
a
feeling
they
are
horrid
but
she
does
appear
to
be
right
about
this
man
he
english
and
though
ellaline
mother
was
half
french
they
were
cousins
and
i
believe
her
dying
request
was
that
he
should
take
care
of
her
daughter
and
her
daughter
money
you
would
have
thought
that
that
must
have
softened
even
a
hard
heart
would
you
but
the
dragon
was
evidently
even
so
many
years
ago
when
he
must
have
been
comparatively
young
if
dragons
are
ever
young
he
accepted
the
charge
ellaline
thinks
her
money
probably
influenced
him
to
do
that
and
perhaps
he
was
paid
for
his
trouble
but
instead
of
carrying
out
his
engagements
like
a
faithful
guardian
he
packed
the
poor
baby
off
to
some
pokey
prim
people
in
the
country
and
promptly
went
abroad
to
enjoy
himself
there
ellaline
would
no
doubt
have
been
left
to
this
day
dreadfully
unhappy
and
out
of
her
element
for
the
people
were
an
english
curate
and
his
wife
but
luckily
her
mother
had
stipulated
that
she
was
to
be
sent
to
the
same
school
in
france
where
she
herself
had
been
educated
madame
de
maluet
never
once
has
her
guardian
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
interest
in
ellaline
has
asked
for
her
photograph
or
written
her
any
letters
they
communicated
with
each
other
only
through
madame
de
maluet
four
times
a
year
or
so
and
ellaline
does
feel
sure
that
her
fortune
has
been
properly
administered
so
she
says
she
ought
to
marry
young
and
have
a
husband
to
look
after
her
interests
when
i
ventured
to
hope
that
the
dragon
was
quite
so
scaly
and
taily
as
she
painted
him
she
proved
her
point
by
telling
me
that
he
been
censured
lately
in
the
english
radical
papers
for
killing
a
lot
of
poor
defenceless
bengalese
in
cold
blood
somebody
must
have
sent
her
the
cuttings
for
ellaline
hardly
knows
that
newspapers
exist
i
dare
say
it
was
kathy
bennett
one
of
madame
few
english
pupils
ellaline
has
chummed
up
with
her
lately
and
that
news
does
seem
to
settle
the
character
does
it
he
must
be
a
perfect
brute
ellaline
says
that
she
rather
die
than
lose
honoré
also
that
kill
himself
if
he
loses
her
and
now
dearest
now
for
the
thunderbolt
she
vows
that
the
only
thing
which
can
possibly
save
her
is
for
to
take
her
place
for
five
or
six
until
her
soldier
manoeuvres
are
over
and
he
can
get
leave
to
whisk
her
off
to
scotland
for
the
wedding
you
the
darling
in
the
world
and
you
generally
know
all
that
people
mean
even
before
they
speak
yet
i
can
see
you
looking
puzzled
as
well
as
startled
and
muttering
to
yourself
take
place
where
how
when
i
was
like
that
myself
while
she
was
trying
to
explain
i
stared
with
an
owlish
stare
for
about
five
minutes
until
her
real
idea
in
all
its
native
wildness
not
to
say
enormity
burst
upon
me
she
wants
to
go
day
after
to
madame
de
blanchemain
as
expected
to
do
before
she
heard
that
the
dragon
was
coming
to
gobble
her
up
she
wants
to
stay
there
quietly
until
honoré
can
take
her
and
she
wants
to
pretend
to
be
ellaline
i
nearly
fell
off
my
chair
at
this
point
but
i
hope
you
wo
do
anything
like
that
which
is
the
reason
why
i
been
working
up
to
the
revelation
with
such
fiendish
subtlety
have
you
noticed
it
ellaline
has
plotted
the
whole
scheme
out
i
should
have
thought
her
capable
of
it
but
she
says
it
desperation
she
certain
she
can
persuade
madame
de
maluet
to
let
her
leave
school
to
go
to
the
station
and
meet
the
dragon
that
the
course
he
himself
suggests
too
much
trouble
even
to
run
out
to
versailles
and
fetch
her
with
only
me
as
chaperon
i
dare
say
she
right
about
madame
for
all
the
teachers
will
be
gone
day
after
and
madame
herself
invariably
collapses
the
moment
school
breaks
up
she
seems
to
break
up
with
it
and
to
have
to
lie
in
bed
for
at
least
half
a
week
to
be
mended
madame
has
really
quite
a
flattering
opinion
of
my
discretion
told
me
so
several
times
i
suppose
it
the
way
i
do
my
hair
for
school
which
does
give
me
a
look
of
incorruptible
virtue
does
it
fortunately
she
does
know
i
always
change
it
if
not
too
tired
ten
minutes
after
i
get
home
to
you
well
then
taking
madame
permission
for
granted
ellaline
points
out
that
all
are
removed
for
she
wo
count
moral
ones
or
let
me
count
them
i
to
see
her
off
for
st
cloud
and
wait
to
receive
the
dragon
sir
behold
the
i
mean
behold
your
ward
and
i
to
go
on
being
a
till
it
convenient
for
the
real
ellaline
to
scrape
my
ashes
off
the
smoking
altar
it
all
very
well
to
make
fun
of
the
thing
like
that
but
to
be
serious
and
goodness
knows
it
serious
enough
what
to
be
done
little
mother
ellaline
has
because
i
insisted
given
me
till
morning
to
answer
i
explained
that
my
consent
must
depend
on
your
consent
so
that
why
i
have
had
anything
to
eat
since
breakfast
i
rushed
home
to
write
this
immense
letter
to
you
and
get
it
off
to
catch
the
post
it
will
arrive
in
the
morning
with
your
coffee
and
how
i
wish
i
were
in
its
place
you
can
take
half
an
hour
to
make
up
your
mind
i
sure
with
your
lightning
wits
you
would
ask
longer
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
great
powers
of
europe
and
then
telegraph
me
simply
yes
or
no
i
will
understand
for
my
own
sake
naturally
i
should
prefer
no
that
goes
unsaid
does
it
i
should
then
be
relieved
of
responsibility
for
even
ellaline
knowing
that
you
and
i
are
all
in
all
to
each
other
could
hardly
expect
me
to
fly
in
your
face
just
to
please
her
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
did
think
i
could
do
this
dreadful
thing
without
thereby
becoming
myself
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
a
glorious
relief
to
pay
my
debt
of
gratitude
to
ellaline
yes
and
even
it
perhaps
one
likes
to
a
debt
that
been
owing
a
long
time
for
it
like
adding
an
accumulation
of
interest
that
one
creditor
never
expected
to
get
when
gasping
after
the
first
shock
i
pleaded
that
i
do
anything
else
make
any
other
sacrifice
for
ellaline
sake
except
this
she
flashed
out
with
the
odd
shrewdness
which
lurks
in
her
childishness
like
a
bright
little
darting
its
head
from
a
bed
of
violets
saying
that
was
always
the
way
with
people
they
were
invariably
ready
to
do
for
their
best
friends
to
whom
they
were
grateful
anything
on
earth
except
the
only
thing
wanted
well
i
had
no
answer
to
make
for
it
true
is
it
and
then
ellaline
sobbed
dreadfully
clutching
at
me
with
little
hot
trembling
hands
crying
that
she
on
me
that
she
been
sure
after
all
my
promises
i
would
fail
her
she
felt
so
with
me
are
you
surprised
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
i
confess
dear
that
if
i
were
quite
alone
in
the
world
though
the
world
would
be
a
world
without
you
i
should
certainly
have
grovelled
and
consented
then
and
there
she
says
she
wo
close
her
eyes
and
i
dare
say
she
wo
in
which
case
she
be
as
pathetic
as
a
broken
flower
i
think
i
shall
sleep
much
either
wondering
what
your
verdict
will
be
i
really
have
the
remotest
idea
whether
it
will
be
yes
or
no
usually
i
imagine
that
i
can
pretty
well
guess
what
your
opinion
is
likely
to
be
but
i
ca
this
time
the
thing
to
decide
upon
is
in
itself
so
fantastic
so
monstrous
that
one
moment
i
tell
myself
you
wo
even
consider
it
the
next
minute
i
remember
what
a
dear
little
crank
you
are
on
the
subject
of
gratitude
your
favourite
virtue
as
you
used
to
write
in
confession
albums
of
provincial
american
friends
when
i
was
a
child
if
people
do
anything
nice
for
you
you
run
your
little
shoes
into
holes
to
do
something
even
nicer
for
them
if
you
invited
out
to
tea
you
ask
your
hostess
to
lunch
or
dinner
in
return
that
sort
of
thing
invariably
and
you
brought
me
up
with
the
same
bee
in
my
bonnet
so
what
your
telegram
be
whatever
you
say
you
may
count
on
a
meek
amen
so
be
it
from
your
most
admiring
subject
audrie
of
course
it
is
as
if
this
man
were
an
ordinary
nice
inoffensive
human
man
is
it
i
do
think
that
almost
any
treatment
is
too
good
for
such
a
supercilious
old
dragon
and
you
need
reprove
me
for
calling
names
with
singular
justice
providence
has
ticketed
him
as
appropriately
as
his
worst
enemy
would
have
dared
to
do
they
have
such
weird
names
in
cornwall
do
they
and
it
seems
he
a
cornishman
until
lately
he
was
plain
mister
now
he
sir
lionel
pendragon
somebody
has
been
weak
enough
to
die
and
leave
him
a
title
and
also
an
estate
though
not
in
cornwall
which
he
returning
to
england
in
greedy
haste
to
pounce
upon
so
characteristic
after
living
away
all
these
years
though
madame
de
maluet
has
tried
to
make
ellaline
believe
he
coming
back
to
settle
down
because
of
a
letter
wrote
reminding
him
respectfully
that
after
nineteen
it
almost
indecent
for
a
girl
to
be
kept
at
school
do
fear
however
if
your
telegram
casts
me
to
the
dragon
that
i
shall
be
in
danger
of
getting
eaten
up
his
dragonship
among
other
stodgy
defects
has
that
of
eminent
repulsive
respectability
he
is
as
respectable
as
a
ramrod
or
a
poker
and
very
elderly
ellaline
says
from
the
way
she
talks
about
him
he
must
be
getting
on
for
a
hundred
and
he
is
provided
with
a
widowed
sister
a
norton
whom
he
has
dug
up
from
some
place
in
the
country
to
act
as
chaperon
for
his
ward
all
other
women
he
is
supposed
to
detest
and
would
if
necessary
beat
them
off
with
a
stick
ii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
chapeau
de
marie
my
spartan
angel
now
the
telegram
come
i
feel
as
if
known
all
along
what
your
decision
would
be
i
glad
you
were
extravagant
enough
to
add
writing
for
morning
i
shall
know
by
exactly
what
mental
processes
you
decided
also
i
glad
i
think
i
glad
that
the
word
is
yes
it
afternoon
now
just
hours
since
i
sat
here
in
the
same
place
at
your
desk
in
the
front
window
of
course
trying
my
best
to
put
the
situation
before
you
as
a
plain
unvarnished
tale
i
stuck
the
bit
of
blue
paper
under
ellaline
nose
and
she
almost
had
a
fit
with
joy
if
she
were
bigger
and
more
muscular
she
have
kissed
and
squeezed
the
breath
of
life
out
of
me
which
would
have
been
awkward
for
her
as
she
then
have
been
thrown
back
upon
her
own
resources
oh
petite
poupee
de
only
think
of
it
i
go
into
space
i
disappear
i
cease
to
exist
there
will
be
no
me
no
audrie
but
instead
two
ellalines
i
often
told
her
by
the
way
that
i
would
make
two
of
her
evidently
i
once
had
a
prophetic
soul
i
only
wish
i
had
it
still
so
i
might
see
beforehand
what
will
happen
to
the
of
ellaline
in
the
next
few
weeks
anyhow
whatever
comes
i
expect
to
be
supported
by
the
consciousness
that
i
paying
a
debt
of
gratitude
as
perhaps
such
a
debt
was
never
paid
before
of
course
i
shall
have
a
perfectly
horrid
time
not
only
shall
i
be
wincing
under
the
degrading
knowledge
that
i
a
base
pretender
but
i
shall
be
wretchedly
homesick
and
bored
within
an
inch
of
my
life
i
shall
be
in
the
sort
of
environment
ellaline
describes
like
a
mouse
in
a
vacuum
a
poor
frisky
happy
caught
for
an
experiment
when
the
experiment
is
finished
i
shall
crawl
away
a
decrepit
wreck
but
thank
heaven
i
can
crawl
to
you
and
you
will
nurse
me
back
to
life
we
talk
everything
over
for
hours
on
end
and
i
be
able
to
abuse
the
dragon
to
my
heart
content
i
know
let
me
do
that
provided
i
do
use
naughty
words
or
if
any
disguise
them
daintily
in
a
whisper
ellaline
and
i
have
discussed
plans
and
possibilities
and
if
all
goes
as
she
expects
i
do
see
why
it
should
i
ought
to
be
freed
from
the
unpleasant
rôle
of
understudy
in
five
or
six
weeks
the
instant
my
chains
are
broken
by
a
telegram
from
the
bride
saying
safely
married
or
words
to
that
effect
i
shall
do
all
my
possible
to
fold
my
tent
like
an
arab
and
silently
steal
not
to
say
sneak
away
from
the
lair
of
the
dragon
without
his
opening
a
scaly
red
eye
to
the
dreadful
reality
until
i
beyond
his
power
it
must
be
either
that
or
the
most
awful
scene
with
him
a
regular
row
he
saying
what
he
thinks
of
my
deception
me
defending
myself
and
the
real
ellaline
by
saying
what
i
think
of
his
general
beastliness
if
it
came
to
that
i
might
in
my
rage
wax
unladylike
so
perhaps
of
the
two
evils
the
lesser
would
be
the
sneak
act
ce
well
i
shall
see
when
the
time
comes
in
five
or
six
weeks
i
had
thought
in
any
case
of
allowing
you
to
leave
should
you
grow
too
restive
lacking
my
society
i
thought
of
proposing
by
then
if
you
were
sufficiently
braced
by
swiss
air
milk
and
honey
and
champel
douches
that
we
should
join
forces
at
a
cheap
but
alluring
farmhouse
somewhere
that
idea
may
still
fit
in
rather
well
may
it
but
if
for
any
unforeseen
reason
i
should
have
to
stay
sizzling
on
the
sacrificial
altar
longer
than
we
expect
you
must
come
home
to
hot
paris
to
economize
and
mope
in
the
flat
you
stop
in
switzerland
till
i
can
meet
you
in
some
nice
place
in
the
country
promise
that
you
add
to
my
burdens
by
being
refractory
i
wire
you
an
address
as
soon
as
i
am
blessed
or
cursed
with
one
and
you
do
do
forget
that
i
merged
in
ellaline
lethbridge
if
her
identity
fits
me
as
badly
as
her
dresses
would
do
it
will
come
about
down
to
my
knees
and
wo
meet
round
the
waist
as
soon
as
i
have
your
letter
morning
dearest
i
write
again
if
only
a
few
lines
then
when
i
seen
the
dragon
and
have
gained
a
vague
idea
how
and
where
he
means
to
dispose
of
his
prey
scribble
off
some
sort
of
description
of
the
man
and
the
meeting
even
if
it
on
board
the
channel
boat
in
the
midst
of
a
tossing
your
iphegenia
or
would
jephtha
daughter
be
more
appropriate
i
not
quite
sure
how
to
spell
either
iii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
chapeau
de
marie
early
dearest
dame
wisdom
you
ought
to
be
to
crowned
heads
you
be
invaluable
worth
any
salary
what
a
shame
you
are
widely
known
a
sort
of
public
possession
but
for
my
sake
glad
you
are
because
if
you
were
discovered
you
never
have
a
spare
minute
to
advise
me
of
course
dear
if
you
had
reached
your
conclusions
just
as
you
did
about
this
step
you
would
have
counselled
or
even
allowed
me
to
take
it
and
i
will
remember
every
word
you
say
i
do
exactly
as
you
tell
me
to
do
so
now
do
worry
any
more
than
you
would
if
i
were
an
experienced
and
accomplished
young
parachutist
about
to
make
a
descent
from
the
top
of
the
eiffel
tower
it
eight
and
i
satisfied
my
soul
with
your
letter
and
my
body
with
its
morning
roll
and
coffee
when
i
finished
scribbling
this
in
pencil
to
you
i
shall
pack
and
be
ready
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
practise
to
deceive
etc
wo
the
dragon
think
it
queer
that
his
rich
ward
should
make
no
better
toilettes
than
i
shall
be
able
to
produce
after
living
at
versailles
practically
in
paris
with
a
huge
amount
of
spending
money
for
a
schoolgirl
i
thought
of
that
difficulty
only
last
night
for
the
first
time
after
i
was
in
bed
and
was
tempted
to
jump
up
and
review
my
wardrobe
but
it
was
unnecessary
not
only
could
i
call
to
mind
in
the
most
lively
way
every
dress
i
have
but
i
do
believe
every
dress
i
ever
did
have
since
my
frocks
were
let
down
or
done
over
from
yours
i
suppose
that
ought
to
make
me
feel
rather
young
ought
it
to
remember
every
dress
i
ever
owned
but
it
does
i
be
this
month
you
know
a
year
older
than
you
were
when
your
ears
were
gladdened
by
my
first
howl
i
sure
it
was
unearthly
yet
that
you
said
at
once
to
dad
the
dear
child
is
going
to
be
musical
but
to
return
to
the
wardrobe
of
the
heiress
understudy
it
consists
of
my
two
white
linen
coats
and
skirts
a
darned
collection
i
do
mean
that
profanely
of
summer
blouses
and
the
everlasting
the
immortal
black
evening
dress
is
it
three
or
four
years
old
i
know
it
was
my
first
black
and
i
did
feel
so
proud
and
when
you
said
i
might
have
it
you
be
asking
yourself
where
is
the
blue
alpaca
she
bought
in
the
bon
marché
sale
which
was
in
the
act
of
being
made
when
i
left
for
up
to
now
i
concealed
from
you
the
tragical
fact
that
that
horrid
little
mademoiselle
voisin
completely
spoiled
it
i
was
so
furious
i
could
have
killed
her
if
she
been
on
the
spot
there
is
no
rage
like
the
dress
rage
is
there
my
one
hope
is
that
the
dragon
may
take
as
little
interest
in
clothes
as
he
has
taken
in
ellaline
self
or
that
being
used
to
the
costumes
of
the
bengalese
which
perhaps
are
somewhat
sketchy
he
may
be
thankful
that
his
ward
has
any
at
all
you
see
i
ca
tell
ellaline
about
this
because
she
could
help
thinking
it
a
hint
for
her
to
supply
the
deficiency
and
i
would
let
her
do
that
even
for
her
own
credit
anyhow
there
be
no
time
to
get
things
so
i
must
just
do
the
best
i
can
and
carry
off
the
old
gray
serge
and
sailor
hat
with
a
stately
air
heaven
gave
me
five
foot
seven
and
a
half
on
purpose
to
do
it
with
now
i
must
pack
like
and
when
i
finished
i
shall
send
the
brown
box
and
the
black
gladstone
to
the
gare
de
lyon
where
will
arrive
from
marseilles
that
is
rather
complicated
as
of
course
we
must
go
to
the
gare
du
nord
for
calais
or
boulogne
but
he
may
wish
to
start
at
once
for
england
and
in
my
new
character
as
his
ward
i
must
be
prepared
to
obey
his
orders
i
hope
he
wo
treat
me
as
he
seems
to
have
treated
the
bengalese
the
luggage
of
miss
ellaline
lethbridge
obviously
ca
be
called
for
at
the
flat
of
brendon
and
her
daughter
audrie
for
there
would
be
questions
and
no
proper
answers
therefore
when
i
present
myself
at
the
gare
de
lyon
i
intend
to
be
all
my
worldly
goods
will
be
there
to
be
disposed
of
as
the
grand
mogul
pleases
when
i
packed
i
shall
hie
me
to
madame
de
maluet
looking
as
good
and
meek
as
a
trained
dove
to
take
charge
of
ellaline
and
to
change
into
ellaline
after
that
the
deluge
darling
me
to
the
lions
but
i
shall
have
your
in
my
pocket
i
ca
be
eaten
though
i
do
feel
rather
like
your
martyr
child
iv
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
board
the
boat
mother
dear
the
does
show
at
all
on
the
outside
i
expected
to
meet
a
creature
of
almost
heraldic
grimness
rampant
disregardant
gules
what
i
did
meet
but
i
afraid
that
is
the
right
way
to
begin
please
consider
that
i
have
begun
i
go
back
to
the
time
when
ellaline
and
her
chaperon
me
started
away
from
school
together
in
a
discreet
and
very
hot
cab
with
her
trunks
she
was
jumpy
and
on
edge
with
excitement
and
got
on
my
nerves
so
that
it
was
the
greatest
relief
when
i
seen
her
off
in
her
train
for
st
cloud
just
at
this
point
i
find
another
break
in
my
narrative
made
by
a
silly
not
at
all
interesting
adventure
i
been
waving
my
hand
for
the
time
to
ellaline
in
response
to
the
same
number
of
waves
from
her
when
at
last
she
drew
in
her
head
as
the
train
steamed
away
i
turned
round
in
a
hurry
lest
she
should
pop
it
out
again
and
bumped
into
a
man
or
what
will
be
a
man
in
a
few
years
if
it
lives
i
said
as
gravely
as
if
it
were
a
man
already
and
it
said
in
french
made
in
england
that
was
entirely
its
fault
it
was
such
a
young
youth
and
looked
so
utterly
english
that
i
smiled
a
motherly
smile
and
breathed
not
at
all
as
i
passed
on
fondly
thinking
to
pass
forever
out
of
its
life
at
the
same
time
but
dearest
the
absurd
little
thing
did
recognize
the
smile
as
motherly
perhaps
it
never
had
a
mother
i
had
hardly
observed
it
as
an
individual
i
assure
you
except
as
one
self
takes
notes
without
permission
from
headquarters
i
was
vaguely
aware
that
the
creature
with
whom
i
had
collided
was
quite
though
freckled
and
possessing
the
shadow
of
a
coming
event
in
the
shape
i
ca
call
it
more
of
a
moustache
i
had
also
an
impression
of
a
panama
hat
which
came
off
in
compliment
to
me
a
gray
flannel
suit
the
latest
kind
of
collar
you
know
sissy
williams
says
feeling
is
for
low
ones
this
year
and
boots
all
that
sounds
hideous
i
know
yet
it
was
at
first
sight
it
was
rather
attractive
but
it
lost
its
attractiveness
in
a
flash
when
it
mistook
the
nature
of
my
smile
you
would
believe
that
a
nice
clean
little
british
face
could
change
so
much
for
the
worse
in
about
the
eighth
part
of
a
second
it
have
taken
longer
or
i
should
have
seen
because
it
happened
between
my
smile
and
my
walking
on
but
i
did
see
a
disagreeable
kind
of
lighting
up
in
the
eyes
which
instantly
made
them
look
full
of
consciousness
of
sex
is
the
only
way
i
can
express
it
and
instead
of
being
inoffensive
boyish
blue
beads
they
were
suddenly
transformed
into
the
sharp
sort
that
the
neapolitans
make
horns
at
well
all
that
was
nothing
to
fuss
about
for
even
know
that
misguided
youths
from
surbiton
or
pawtucket
who
are
quite
harmless
at
home
think
they
owe
it
to
themselves
to
be
gay
dogs
when
they
run
over
to
paris
otherwise
they
not
get
their
money
worth
if
it
been
for
what
came
afterward
i
would
be
wasting
paper
and
ink
on
a
silly
young
bounder
as
it
is
i
just
tell
you
what
happened
and
see
if
you
think
i
was
to
blame
or
whether
there
likely
to
be
any
bother
at
that
change
my
look
slid
off
the
face
like
rain
off
a
particularly
slippery
duck
back
he
ought
to
have
known
then
if
he
had
before
that
i
considered
him
a
mere
it
but
i
can
just
imagine
his
saying
to
himself
this
is
paris
and
i
paid
five
pounds
for
a
return
ticket
must
have
something
to
tell
the
chaps
what
a
girl
doing
out
alone
he
came
after
me
and
said
i
dropped
something
so
i
had
it
was
a
rose
i
was
going
to
disclaim
it
with
all
the
haughty
grace
of
a
broomstick
when
suddenly
i
remembered
that
it
was
my
so
to
speak
the
dragon
had
prescribed
it
in
his
last
letter
to
madame
de
maluet
about
meeting
ellaline
as
there
might
be
difficulty
in
recognition
if
she
came
to
the
station
with
a
chaperon
as
strange
to
him
as
herself
it
would
be
well
he
suggested
that
each
pinned
a
red
rose
on
her
dress
then
he
would
look
out
for
two
ladies
with
two
roses
i
could
make
myself
into
two
ladies
with
two
roses
but
i
must
be
one
lady
with
one
rose
otherwise
the
dragon
and
i
might
miss
each
other
and
he
would
go
out
to
versailles
to
see
what
the
dickens
was
the
matter
then
the
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
with
a
vengeance
you
see
i
had
to
say
yes
to
the
rose
because
there
was
time
to
call
at
a
florist
and
try
to
buy
another
red
label
before
going
on
to
the
gare
de
lyon
i
put
out
my
hand
with
a
thank
you
that
sounded
as
if
it
needed
oiling
but
as
if
on
second
thought
the
silly
idiot
asked
if
he
might
keep
the
flower
for
himself
it
looks
like
an
english
rose
said
he
with
a
glance
which
transferred
the
compliment
to
me
certainly
not
sir
said
i
i
need
it
myself
if
that
all
you
might
let
me
give
you
a
whole
bunch
to
make
up
for
it
said
he
then
i
said
go
away
which
may
have
been
elegant
but
was
to
the
point
and
i
walked
on
with
long
steps
toward
the
place
where
there
were
cabs
but
quite
a
short
man
is
as
tall
as
a
tall
girl
and
his
steps
were
as
long
as
mine
i
say
said
he
you
need
be
so
cross
what
the
harm
as
long
as
we
both
english
and
this
is
paris
i
not
english
i
snapped
if
you
do
go
away
i
call
a
gendarme
you
will
look
a
fool
if
you
do
a
great
tall
girl
like
you
said
he
trying
to
be
funny
and
it
did
sound
funny
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
pretty
nervous
after
all
i
gone
through
with
ellaline
for
i
almost
giggled
but
i
did
quite
on
the
contrary
i
marched
on
like
a
about
to
burst
and
proved
my
origin
by
addressing
a
cabman
in
the
parisian
french
i
inherited
from
you
i
hoped
that
the
boy
could
understand
but
he
did
mademoiselle
i
have
to
go
to
the
gare
de
lyon
too
he
announced
and
it
would
be
a
very
friendly
act
and
show
that
you
forgive
me
if
you
let
me
take
you
there
in
a
which
you
find
much
nicer
than
that
old
noah
ark
you
engaging
i
do
forgive
you
i
said
as
i
mounted
into
the
alleged
ark
your
only
excuse
is
that
you
not
grown
up
yet
with
that
parthian
shot
i
ordered
my
who
was
furtively
grinning
by
this
time
to
drive
on
as
quickly
as
possible
of
course
the
horrid
child
from
surbiton
or
somewhere
did
have
to
go
to
the
gare
de
lyon
but
evidently
he
regarded
me
as
his
last
hope
of
an
adventure
before
returning
to
his
native
heath
or
duckpond
so
naturally
he
followed
in
a
whose
turbulent
had
to
be
subdued
to
gait
i
did
look
behind
but
i
felt
in
my
bones
my
funny
bones
that
he
was
there
and
when
i
arrived
at
the
gare
de
lyon
so
did
he
the
train
i
come
to
meet
was
a
and
o
special
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
it
was
in
yet
so
i
had
to
wait
cats
may
look
at
kings
said
my
gay
cavalier
cads
may
though
said
i
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
maintained
a
dignified
silence
but
that
was
irresistible
you
hard
on
a
chap
said
he
i
tell
you
what
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
you
mademoiselle
and
i
believe
you
up
to
some
little
game
of
your
own
when
the
cat
away
the
mice
will
play
got
rid
of
your
friend
and
you
out
for
a
lark
on
your
own
what
oh
would
i
have
loved
to
box
his
ears
but
this
time
i
was
dignified
and
turned
my
back
on
him
luckily
the
train
came
puffing
into
the
station
and
he
ceased
to
bother
me
actively
for
the
time
but
the
worst
is
to
follow
now
i
think
i
got
to
the
part
of
my
story
where
the
dragon
ought
to
appear
suddenly
as
the
train
stopped
that
platform
of
a
paris
railway
station
was
turned
into
a
thoroughly
english
scene
a
wave
from
great
britain
swept
over
it
a
tall
and
tweedy
wave
bearing
with
it
golf
clubs
and
kitbags
and
every
kind
of
english
flotsam
and
jetsam
all
the
passengers
had
lately
landed
from
the
foreignest
of
foreign
parts
coral
strands
and
that
sort
of
remote
thing
but
they
looked
as
incorruptibly
triumphantly
british
every
man
woman
and
child
of
them
except
a
fringe
of
black
or
brown
servants
as
if
they
had
strolled
over
from
across
channel
for
a
saturday
to
monday
in
gay
paree
one
ca
help
admiring
as
well
as
wondering
at
that
sort
of
ineradicable
persistent
britishness
can
one
i
believe
it
partly
the
secret
of
great
britain
success
in
colonizing
her
people
are
so
calmly
sure
of
their
superiority
over
all
other
races
that
the
other
races
end
by
believing
it
and
trying
to
imitate
their
ways
instead
of
fighting
to
maintain
the
right
to
their
own
that
feeling
came
over
me
as
i
a
mere
french
and
american
chit
stood
aside
to
let
the
wave
flow
on
everyone
looked
so
important
and
unaware
of
the
existence
of
foreigners
except
porters
that
i
was
afraid
my
particular
drop
of
the
wave
might
sail
by
on
the
crest
without
noticing
me
or
my
red
rose
i
tried
to
make
myself
little
and
the
rose
big
as
if
it
were
in
the
foreground
and
i
in
the
perspective
but
the
procession
moved
on
and
nobody
who
could
possibly
have
been
the
dragon
wasted
a
glance
on
me
toward
the
tail
end
however
i
spied
two
men
coming
followed
by
a
small
bronze
figure
in
native
dress
of
some
sort
one
of
the
two
was
tall
and
tanned
and
or
so
the
other
i
had
a
bet
with
myself
that
he
was
my
dragon
but
it
was
like
betting
on
a
certainty
which
is
one
of
the
few
things
that
dull
and
dishonest
at
the
same
time
some
men
are
born
dragons
while
others
only
achieve
dragonhood
or
have
it
thrust
upon
them
by
the
gout
this
one
was
born
a
dragon
and
exactly
what
i
imagined
him
or
even
worse
and
i
was
glad
that
i
could
conscientiously
hate
him
in
peace
the
other
man
had
the
walk
so
many
englishmen
have
as
if
he
were
tracking
lions
across
a
desert
i
quite
admire
that
gait
for
it
looks
brave
and
but
the
old
thing
labelled
dragon
marched
along
as
if
trampling
on
prostrate
bengalese
a
tory
of
course
that
went
without
saying
of
the
type
that
thinks
radicals
deserve
hanging
in
his
eyes
that
stony
glare
which
english
people
have
when
they
afraid
someone
may
be
wanting
to
know
them
under
his
chin
like
you
see
in
the
necks
of
elderly
bull
dogs
a
snobbish
nose
a
mouth
age
anywhere
between
sixty
and
a
hundred
altogether
one
of
those
men
who
must
write
to
the
or
go
mad
dost
like
the
picture
both
these
men
who
were
walking
together
looked
at
me
rather
hard
and
i
attributed
the
dragon
failure
to
stop
at
the
sign
of
the
rose
to
the
silly
vanity
which
forbade
his
wearing
specs
like
a
sensible
old
gentleman
accordingly
with
laudable
presence
of
mind
i
did
what
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
i
stepped
forward
and
addressed
him
with
the
modest
firmness
madame
de
maluet
pupils
are
taught
in
deportment
lessons
i
beg
your
pardon
but
are
you
sir
lionel
pendragon
i
am
lionel
pendragon
said
the
other
man
the
quite
young
man
mother
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
the
shadow
of
a
feather
they
both
took
off
their
travelling
caps
the
real
dragon
was
in
decent
taste
the
mock
dragon
displayed
an
offensive
check
have
you
come
to
say
that
miss
lethbridge
has
been
prevented
from
meeting
me
asked
the
real
one
the
i
call
him
for
the
moment
i
am
it
stuck
in
my
throat
and
would
go
up
or
down
so
i
compromised
which
was
weak
of
me
as
i
always
think
on
principle
better
lie
all
in
all
or
not
at
all
i
suppose
you
do
recognize
me
i
mumbled
fluffily
what
it
not
possible
that
you
ellaline
lethbridge
the
exclaimed
in
surprise
which
might
mean
horror
of
my
person
or
a
compliment
i
gasped
like
a
fish
out
of
water
and
wriggled
my
neck
in
a
silly
way
which
a
charitable
man
unaccustomed
to
women
might
take
for
schoolgirl
gawkishness
in
a
spasm
of
acquiescence
instantly
he
put
out
his
hand
and
wrung
mine
extremely
hard
it
would
have
crunched
the
real
ellaline
rings
into
her
poor
little
fingers
you
must
forgive
me
he
said
i
saw
the
rose
and
he
smiled
a
wonderfully
agreeable
undragonlike
smile
which
put
him
back
to
but
i
was
looking
out
for
a
very
different
sort
of
er
young
lady
why
i
asked
losing
my
presence
of
mind
i
well
really
i
do
know
why
said
he
and
i
was
looking
for
a
very
different
sort
of
man
i
retorted
feeling
idiotically
schoolgirlish
and
sillier
every
minute
he
smiled
again
then
even
more
nicely
than
before
and
followed
the
example
i
had
set
why
he
inquired
unlike
him
i
did
know
why
only
too
well
but
it
was
difficult
to
explain
still
i
had
to
say
something
or
make
things
worse
when
in
doubt
play
a
trump
or
tell
the
truth
i
quoted
to
myself
as
a
precept
and
said
out
aloud
that
somehow
or
other
i
thought
he
would
be
old
so
i
am
old
he
said
old
enough
to
be
your
father
when
he
added
that
information
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
take
it
back
again
and
his
face
coloured
up
with
a
dull
painful
red
as
if
said
something
attached
to
a
disagreeable
memory
that
was
what
his
expression
suggested
to
me
but
as
i
know
for
a
fact
that
he
has
not
at
all
a
nice
kind
character
i
suppose
in
reality
what
he
felt
was
only
a
stupid
prick
of
vanity
at
having
inadvertently
given
his
age
away
i
nearly
blurted
out
the
truth
about
mine
which
would
have
got
me
into
hot
water
at
once
as
ellaline
hardly
nineteen
and
i
practically
worse
luck
for
you
by
this
time
the
mock
dragon
had
walked
slowly
on
but
the
brown
image
in
native
dress
had
glued
himself
to
the
platform
near
by
too
respectful
to
be
aware
of
my
existence
while
i
was
debating
whether
or
no
the
last
speech
called
for
an
answer
the
had
a
sudden
thought
which
gave
him
an
excuse
to
change
the
subject
where
your
chaperon
he
snapped
with
a
flash
of
the
eye
which
was
his
first
betrayal
of
the
hidden
devil
within
him
she
was
called
away
to
visit
a
relative
i
answered
promptly
because
ellaline
and
i
had
agreed
i
was
to
say
that
and
in
a
way
it
was
true
you
did
come
here
alone
said
he
i
had
to
said
i
then
it
a
monstrous
thing
that
madame
de
maluet
should
have
let
you
he
growled
i
shall
write
and
tell
her
so
oh
do
please
do
i
begged
you
can
guess
how
anxiously
she
really
help
it
and
i
shall
be
so
sorry
to
distress
her
he
was
still
glaring
and
desperation
made
me
crafty
you
would
refuse
the
first
thing
i
asked
you
i
tried
to
wheedle
him
i
hoped
for
ellaline
sake
of
course
that
i
should
get
another
smile
but
instead
i
got
a
frown
now
i
begin
to
realize
that
you
are
your
mother
daughter
said
he
in
a
queer
hard
tone
no
i
wo
refuse
the
first
thing
you
ask
me
but
perhaps
you
better
not
consider
that
a
precedent
i
wo
said
i
he
been
looking
so
pleased
with
me
before
as
if
he
found
me
in
a
prize
package
or
won
me
in
a
lottery
when
expected
to
draw
a
blank
but
though
he
gave
in
without
a
struggle
to
my
wheedling
he
now
looked
as
if
he
discovered
that
i
was
stuffed
with
sawdust
my
quick
i
wo
did
seem
to
encourage
him
a
bit
well
he
said
in
a
duller
tone
we
get
out
of
this
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
and
meet
me
i
see
now
i
ought
to
have
asked
it
but
to
tell
the
truth
the
thought
of
going
to
a
girls
school
and
claiming
you
i
quite
understand
i
nipped
in
this
is
much
better
my
luggage
is
all
here
i
added
i
could
think
where
else
to
send
it
as
i
know
what
your
plans
might
be
at
that
he
looked
annoyed
again
but
luckily
only
with
himself
this
time
i
fear
i
am
an
ass
where
women
affairs
are
concerned
he
said
of
course
i
ought
to
have
thought
about
your
luggage
and
settled
every
detail
for
you
with
madame
de
maluet
instead
of
trusting
to
her
discretion
still
it
does
seem
as
if
she
i
would
let
him
blame
madame
but
i
could
defend
her
without
risking
danger
for
ellaline
and
myself
because
madame
arrangements
were
all
perfect
if
we
had
secretly
upset
them
i
have
so
luggage
i
broke
in
trying
to
make
up
with
emphasis
for
irrelevancy
and
madame
considers
me
quite
a
person
i
assure
you
i
suppose
you
are
he
admitted
observing
my
inches
with
a
worried
air
i
ought
to
have
realized
but
somehow
or
other
i
expected
to
find
a
child
i
shall
be
less
bother
to
you
than
if
i
were
a
child
i
consoled
him
this
did
make
him
smile
again
for
some
reason
as
he
replied
that
he
was
sure
and
we
were
starting
to
hook
ourselves
on
to
the
tail
end
of
the
dwindling
procession
quite
on
friendly
terms
when
to
my
horror
that
young
english
cadlet
or
boundling
which
you
will
strolled
calmly
out
in
front
of
us
and
said
how
do
you
do
sir
lionel
pendragon
afraid
you
do
remember
me
dick
burden
anyhow
you
recollect
my
mother
and
aunt
i
had
forgotten
all
about
the
creature
dearest
but
there
he
had
been
lurking
ready
to
pounce
and
what
bad
luck
that
he
should
know
ellaline
guardian
was
it
at
first
i
thought
maybe
he
really
had
had
business
at
the
gare
de
lyon
and
that
i
partly
misjudged
him
and
then
it
flashed
into
my
head
that
on
the
contrary
he
did
really
know
sir
lionel
but
had
overheard
the
name
and
was
doing
a
bluff
to
get
introduced
to
me
was
that
a
conceited
idea
but
neither
was
true
at
least
the
latter
was
i
know
and
i
pretty
sure
the
first
was
what
i
think
is
this
that
he
simply
followed
me
to
the
gare
de
lyon
for
the
deviltry
of
the
thing
and
because
he
nothing
better
to
do
that
he
hung
about
in
sheer
curiosity
to
see
whom
i
was
meeting
and
that
he
recognized
the
dragon
as
an
old
acquaintance
i
once
fondly
supposed
coincidences
were
remarkable
and
rare
events
but
i
known
ever
since
i
known
the
troubles
of
life
that
it
only
agreeable
ones
which
are
rare
such
as
coming
across
your
who
decided
to
leave
you
all
his
money
just
as
you
made
up
your
mind
to
commit
suicide
or
marry
a
jewish
diamond
merchant
disagreeable
coincidences
sit
about
on
damp
clouds
ready
to
fall
on
you
the
minute
they
think
you
do
expect
them
and
they
more
likely
to
occur
than
not
that
my
experience
evidently
the
dragon
did
remember
dick
mother
and
aunt
for
the
first
blankness
of
his
expression
brightened
into
intelligence
with
the
mention
of
the
youth
female
belongings
he
held
out
his
hand
cordially
and
remarked
that
of
course
he
remembered
mrs
burden
and
senter
as
for
dick
he
had
grown
out
of
all
recollection
it
was
a
good
many
years
ago
returned
the
said
dick
hastening
to
disprove
the
slur
of
youthfulness
it
was
just
before
i
went
to
sandhurst
but
you
have
changed
i
knew
you
at
once
on
leave
i
suppose
suggested
sir
lionel
no
said
dick
i
not
in
the
army
failed
truth
is
i
did
want
to
get
in
was
cut
out
for
it
there
only
one
profession
i
care
for
what
that
the
dragon
was
obliged
to
ask
out
of
politeness
though
i
do
think
he
cared
much
the
fact
is
returned
mr
burden
a
most
appropriate
name
according
to
my
point
of
view
it
rather
a
queer
one
or
might
seem
so
to
you
and
i
promised
the
mater
i
wo
talk
of
it
unless
i
do
adopt
it
and
i
over
here
qualifying
now
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
hoped
he
excited
our
curiosity
and
he
must
have
been
disappointed
in
sir
lionel
indeed
as
for
me
i
tried
to
make
my
eyes
look
like
boiled
gooseberries
an
unenthusiastic
fruit
especially
when
cooked
i
was
delighted
with
the
dragon
though
for
not
introducing
him
having
said
indeed
sir
lionel
added
that
we
must
be
getting
on
luggage
to
see
to
his
valet
a
foreigner
and
more
bother
than
use
i
took
my
cue
and
pattered
along
by
my
guardian
side
his
tall
form
a
narrow
yet
impassable
bulwark
between
me
and
dick
burden
but
pattered
too
refusing
to
be
thrown
off
he
asked
sir
lionel
if
he
were
staying
on
in
paris
and
in
the
short
conversation
that
followed
i
picked
up
morsels
of
news
which
had
been
given
me
yet
it
appeared
that
the
dragon
sister
who
would
suspect
a
dragon
of
sisters
had
wired
to
marseilles
that
she
would
meet
him
in
paris
and
he
expected
to
find
her
at
an
hotel
he
did
say
what
hotel
so
it
was
evident
dick
burden
need
not
hope
for
an
invitation
to
call
apparently
our
plans
depended
somewhat
on
her
but
sir
lionel
thought
we
should
get
away
next
day
at
latest
there
was
nothing
to
keep
him
in
paris
and
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
reach
england
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
for
fear
some
more
coincidences
might
happen
such
as
meeting
madame
de
maluet
or
one
of
the
teachers
conscience
does
make
you
a
coward
i
never
noticed
mine
much
before
i
wish
you
could
take
powders
as
you
do
for
neuralgia
would
they
sell
like
hot
cakes
at
last
dick
burden
had
to
go
away
without
getting
the
introduction
he
wanted
and
sir
lionel
was
either
very
or
else
very
obstinate
not
to
give
it
i
not
sure
which
but
if
i
were
a
betting
character
i
should
bet
on
the
latter
i
begin
to
see
that
his
may
be
expected
to
leak
out
in
his
attitude
toward
woman
as
a
sex
already
i
detected
the
most
primitive
almost
primæval
ideas
in
him
which
probably
he
contracted
in
bengal
would
you
believe
it
he
insisted
on
my
putting
on
a
veil
to
travel
with
but
i
have
come
to
that
part
yet
as
for
mr
burden
as
i
said
he
disappeared
from
our
view
but
i
doubt
if
we
disappeared
from
his
you
may
think
this
is
conceited
in
me
but
as
he
took
off
his
panama
in
saying
he
contrived
to
peer
at
me
round
an
unfortified
corner
of
the
dragon
and
the
look
he
flung
me
said
more
plainly
than
words
this
is
all
right
but
i
hanged
if
i
see
it
through
or
something
even
more
emphatic
to
that
effect
sir
lionel
was
surprised
when
he
saw
my
luggage
which
we
picked
up
when
he
claimed
his
own
i
thought
young
ladies
never
went
anywhere
without
a
dozen
boxes
said
he
oh
mamma
and
i
travelled
half
over
europe
with
only
one
trunk
and
two
bags
between
us
i
blurted
out
before
i
stopped
to
think
then
i
wished
the
floor
would
yawn
and
swallow
me
up
he
did
stare
and
his
eyes
are
dreadfully
piercing
when
he
stares
they
are
very
gray
ones
but
i
can
tell
you
they
felt
like
hatpins
i
should
have
thought
you
were
too
young
in
those
days
to
know
anything
about
luggage
said
he
that
gave
me
a
straw
to
clutch
madame
de
maluet
has
told
me
a
great
deal
so
she
has
about
one
thing
or
another
mostly
my
own
faults
oh
i
see
he
said
it
must
have
seemed
funny
to
him
my
saying
that
about
the
trunks
as
ellaline
mother
died
when
was
four
he
had
much
luggage
either
no
golf
clubs
or
or
whatever
you
play
about
with
in
bengal
when
you
are
terrorizing
the
natives
he
sent
the
brown
servant
off
in
one
cab
with
our
things
and
put
me
in
another
into
which
he
also
mounted
it
did
seem
funny
driving
off
with
him
for
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
i
was
never
alone
with
a
man
before
but
he
was
gawkier
about
it
than
i
was
not
exactly
shy
i
hardly
know
how
to
express
it
but
he
could
help
showing
that
he
was
out
of
his
element
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
he
shaken
hands
with
the
mock
dragon
and
shunted
him
off
just
as
ruthlessly
as
he
did
the
boy
see
you
in
london
sooner
or
later
said
he
as
if
anyone
could
want
to
see
such
a
disagreeable
old
thing
yet
perhaps
if
i
but
knew
the
mock
character
may
be
the
nobler
of
the
two
if
i
were
to
judge
by
appearances
i
should
have
liked
the
real
dragon
looks
and
thought
from
first
sight
that
he
was
rather
a
brave
fine
person
even
unselfish
whereas
i
know
from
all
ellaline
has
told
me
that
his
qualities
are
quite
the
reverse
of
these
we
were
going
to
the
grand
hotel
and
driving
there
he
pumped
up
a
few
perfunctory
sort
of
questions
about
school
the
way
people
who
do
understand
children
talk
to
little
girls
you
know
do
you
like
your
lessons
what
do
you
do
on
holidays
what
is
your
middle
name
sort
of
thing
i
was
afraid
i
should
laugh
so
i
asked
him
questions
instead
and
all
the
time
he
seemed
to
be
studying
me
in
a
puzzled
surprised
way
as
if
i
were
a
duck
that
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
chicken
egg
or
a
goblin
in
a
nonconformist
home
if
he
keeps
on
doing
this
i
shall
to
find
out
what
he
means
by
it
or
i
asked
him
about
his
sister
as
i
thought
bengal
might
be
a
sore
subject
and
he
appeared
to
think
that
i
already
knew
something
of
her
if
ellaline
does
know
she
forgot
to
tell
me
and
i
hope
other
things
like
that
wo
be
continually
cropping
up
or
my
nerves
wo
stand
it
shall
take
to
throwing
spoons
and
he
reminded
me
of
her
name
being
norton
and
that
she
a
widow
he
had
expected
her
to
come
over
he
said
and
he
was
surprised
to
get
her
telegram
but
no
doubt
he
find
out
that
she
a
pretty
good
reason
and
it
was
nothing
to
be
astonished
at
her
not
meeting
him
at
the
gare
de
lyon
for
she
invariably
missed
people
when
she
went
to
railway
stations
it
had
been
a
characteristic
of
hers
since
youth
when
they
were
both
young
they
were
often
in
paris
together
for
they
had
french
cousins
ellaline
mother
people
i
suppose
and
then
they
stopped
at
the
grand
hotel
he
had
been
there
though
he
added
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
had
been
out
of
england
without
coming
back
for
fifteen
that
made
him
seem
old
talking
of
what
happened
twenty
years
ago
almost
my
whole
life
yet
he
does
look
more
than
at
most
i
wonder
does
the
climate
of
bengal
preserve
people
like
flies
in
amber
perhaps
he
really
sixty
and
has
this
unnatural
appearance
of
youth
does
norton
know
about
me
i
asked
why
of
course
she
does
said
he
i
wrote
her
she
must
come
and
live
with
me
when
i
found
i
got
to
have
he
shut
up
like
a
clam
on
that
and
looked
so
horribly
ashamed
of
himself
that
i
burst
out
laughing
please
do
mind
said
i
i
know
i
an
incubus
but
i
try
to
be
as
little
trouble
as
possible
you
an
incubus
he
contradicted
me
almost
indignantly
you
entirely
different
from
what
i
thought
you
would
be
oh
then
you
thought
i
be
an
incubus
i
could
resist
the
temptation
of
retorting
maybe
it
was
cruel
but
there
no
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
dragons
so
it
ca
be
considered
wrong
in
humane
circles
not
at
all
but
i
i
do
know
much
about
women
especially
girls
said
he
and
i
told
you
i
thought
of
you
as
a
child
i
hope
you
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
engaging
a
nurse
for
me
i
suggested
and
if
he
were
cross
at
being
teased
he
did
show
it
he
said
he
trusted
all
such
arrangements
to
his
sister
he
had
seen
her
for
many
years
but
she
was
and
he
hoped
that
we
would
get
on
what
i
principally
hoped
was
that
she
would
prove
to
be
of
a
nature
for
a
detective
on
the
hearth
would
be
inconvenient
and
women
can
be
so
sharp
about
each
other
i
found
that
out
at
madame
de
maluet
i
never
would
from
you
dear
you
were
a
cat
in
any
of
your
previous
incarnations
i
think
you
must
have
evoluted
from
that
neat
blending
of
serpent
and
dove
which
eventually
produces
a
perfect
parisienne
we
went
into
the
big
hall
of
the
grand
hotel
where
sir
lionel
said
in
his
day
carriages
used
to
drive
in
and
suddenly
to
my
own
surprise
i
felt
gay
and
excited
as
if
this
were
life
and
i
had
begun
to
live
i
did
regret
having
to
play
ellaline
one
bit
everything
seemed
great
fun
you
know
darling
i
have
had
much
life
except
in
you
and
books
since
i
was
sixteen
and
our
pennies
and
jauntings
finished
up
at
the
same
time
though
i
had
plenty
before
that
all
sorts
of
samples
anyhow
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
the
bright
worldly
look
of
the
hotel
which
gave
me
that
tingling
sensation
as
if
a
little
wild
bird
had
burst
into
song
in
my
heart
although
it
out
of
season
for
parisians
the
hall
was
full
of
people
mostly
americans
and
other
foreigners
as
we
came
in
a
lady
rose
from
a
seat
near
the
door
she
was
small
and
the
least
fashionable
or
person
in
the
room
yet
with
the
air
of
being
satisfied
with
herself
morally
i
saw
at
once
she
was
of
the
type
who
considers
her
church
a
home
from
home
who
dresses
her
house
as
if
it
were
a
person
and
upholsters
herself
as
if
she
were
a
sofa
of
course
i
knew
it
was
norton
and
i
disappointed
i
would
almost
have
preferred
her
to
be
catty
she
and
her
brother
had
seen
each
other
for
fifteen
years
but
they
met
as
calmly
as
if
they
had
lunched
together
yesterday
i
think
though
that
was
more
her
fault
than
his
for
when
he
held
out
his
hand
she
lifted
it
up
on
a
level
with
her
chin
to
shake
and
of
course
that
would
have
taken
the
go
out
of
a
grasshopper
i
suppose
it
have
been
good
form
to
kiss
in
a
hotel
hall
but
if
retrieved
a
brother
in
any
sort
of
hall
i
do
believe
i
could
resist
her
hair
was
so
plainly
drawn
back
it
was
like
a
moral
influence
and
her
toque
sat
up
high
on
her
head
like
a
bun
or
a
travelling
pincushion
the
only
trimming
on
her
dress
was
buttons
but
there
were
a
large
family
of
them
sir
lionel
introduced
us
and
she
said
she
was
pleased
to
meet
me
also
that
i
was
not
at
all
like
my
mother
or
father
then
she
asked
if
i
had
ever
been
to
england
but
luckily
before
i
had
a
chance
to
compromise
myself
by
saying
that
i
lived
a
few
months
in
london
but
had
been
nowhere
else
there
where
our
money
began
to
give
out
her
brother
reminded
her
that
i
was
only
four
when
i
left
england
of
course
i
had
forgotten
said
norton
but
do
they
ever
take
them
over
to
see
the
british
museum
or
the
national
gallery
i
should
have
thought
it
would
be
an
education
with
cheap
returns
probably
french
schoolmistresses
believe
that
their
pupils
get
their
money
worth
on
the
french
side
of
the
channel
replied
sir
lionel
oh
said
norton
and
looked
at
me
as
if
to
see
how
the
system
had
answered
i
sure
she
approved
of
the
gray
serge
and
the
sailor
hat
more
than
she
approved
of
the
girl
in
them
you
see
i
do
think
she
sanctions
hair
that
is
dark
brown
we
did
sit
down
but
talked
standing
up
sir
lionel
and
his
sister
throwing
me
words
out
of
politeness
now
and
then
she
has
a
nice
voice
though
cold
as
iced
water
that
has
been
filtered
her
name
is
emily
it
be
he
said
he
was
surprised
as
well
as
pleased
to
get
her
telegram
on
arriving
at
marseilles
and
it
was
very
good
of
her
to
come
to
paris
and
meet
him
she
said
not
at
all
it
was
no
trouble
but
a
pleasure
or
rather
it
would
be
if
it
were
for
the
sad
reason
that
brought
her
why
is
anybody
dead
asked
sir
lionel
looking
as
if
he
were
running
over
a
list
in
his
head
but
could
call
up
a
name
which
concerned
him
personally
there
been
a
thinning
off
among
old
friends
lately
i
sorry
to
say
i
told
you
about
most
of
them
i
think
in
postscripts
replied
norton
but
it
was
their
loss
poor
dears
which
brought
me
over
it
was
the
fire
what
fire
her
brother
wanted
to
know
why
fire
surely
you
must
have
seen
about
it
in
london
papers
london
papers
wo
get
to
marseilles
till
and
i
have
been
long
enough
in
paris
to
see
one
yet
explained
sir
lionel
have
i
had
a
serious
fire
and
what
has
been
burnt
he
spoke
as
coolly
as
if
it
were
the
question
of
a
mutton
chop
part
of
the
house
returned
norton
not
even
trying
to
break
it
to
him
i
hope
not
the
old
part
said
he
no
it
is
the
new
wing
but
seemed
to
me
such
a
pity
such
a
beautiful
bathroom
hot
and
cold
spray
and
shower
quite
destroyed
and
a
noble
linen
closet
heated
throughout
with
pipes
and
fully
stocked
the
bathroom
may
have
been
early
pullman
and
the
linen
closet
late
german
lloyd
my
dear
emily
but
the
rest
of
the
house
is
tudor
and
ca
be
replaced
said
sir
lionel
and
i
was
sure
as
he
looked
down
at
his
sister
of
a
thing
i
already
suspected
that
he
has
a
sense
of
humour
that
a
modern
improvement
with
which
you
would
expect
a
dragon
to
be
fitted
but
i
begin
to
see
that
this
is
an
elaborate
and
complicated
dragon
some
people
are
pharisees
about
their
sense
of
humour
and
keep
harping
on
it
till
you
wish
it
were
a
live
wire
and
would
electrocute
them
would
rather
be
ashamed
of
his
i
fancy
and
yet
it
must
have
amused
him
and
made
him
feel
good
chums
with
himself
away
out
in
bengal
norton
said
that
warings
had
very
handsome
tudor
in
one
or
two
of
their
model
houses
so
nothing
was
irrevocable
nowadays
but
she
was
pleased
if
he
was
that
only
the
modern
wing
was
injured
it
had
happened
yesterday
morning
just
too
late
for
the
newspapers
which
must
have
annoyed
the
editors
and
she
had
felt
that
it
would
be
best
to
undertake
the
journey
to
paris
and
consult
about
plans
as
it
might
make
a
difference
here
she
glanced
at
me
but
she
mentioned
the
fire
when
wiring
because
things
seemed
worse
in
telegrams
and
besides
it
would
have
been
a
useless
expense
no
doubt
it
had
been
stupid
of
her
but
she
had
fancied
he
would
certainly
see
it
in
the
paper
with
all
details
and
therefore
guess
why
she
was
meeting
him
we
have
nowhere
to
take
miss
lethbridge
said
she
since
graylees
castle
will
be
overrun
with
workmen
for
some
time
to
come
i
did
know
but
you
might
feel
it
would
be
best
after
all
for
us
to
put
her
again
in
charge
of
her
old
schoolmistress
for
a
few
weeks
if
hair
could
really
rise
mine
would
have
instantly
cast
out
every
hairpin
as
if
they
were
so
many
evil
spirits
and
have
stood
out
all
around
my
head
like
strumpelpeter
yet
there
was
nothing
i
could
say
if
i
were
mistress
of
a
dozen
languages
i
should
have
had
to
be
speechless
in
every
one
but
i
saw
sir
lionel
looking
at
me
and
i
hastily
gave
him
a
silent
treatment
with
my
eyes
it
had
the
most
satisfactory
effect
no
i
do
think
we
will
take
her
back
to
madame
de
maluet
said
he
madame
may
have
made
other
plans
for
the
holiday
season
perhaps
she
is
going
away
i
sure
she
is
said
i
she
is
going
to
visit
her
aunt
sir
lionel
was
still
looking
at
me
lost
in
thought
i
forget
if
i
mentioned
that
he
has
nice
eyes
i
have
time
to
look
back
and
see
if
i
did
now
i
scribbling
as
fast
as
i
can
we
shall
soon
land
and
i
want
to
post
this
at
dover
if
i
can
get
an
english
stamp
off
someone
as
sissy
williams
our
only
british
neighbour
says
how
would
you
like
a
trip
sir
lionel
asked
abruptly
the
relief
from
suspense
was
almost
too
great
and
i
nearly
jumped
down
his
throat
so
after
all
it
would
have
been
my
own
fault
if
the
dragon
had
eaten
me
i
should
it
i
said
my
dear
protested
norton
indulgently
one
adores
heavenly
beings
i
not
sure
a
is
a
heavenly
being
said
i
though
perhaps
without
capitals
the
dragon
smiled
but
she
looked
awfully
shocked
and
no
doubt
blamed
madame
de
maluet
i
a
mercédès
promised
to
be
ready
on
my
arrival
said
sir
lionel
still
reflective
you
know
emily
the
little
car
i
had
sent
out
to
east
bengal
was
a
mercédès
if
i
could
drive
her
i
can
drive
a
bigger
car
everybody
says
it
easier
and
young
nick
has
learned
to
be
a
mechanic
i
suppose
young
nick
must
be
the
dragon
pet
name
for
the
bronze
image
what
fun
that
he
should
be
a
chauffeur
fancy
an
indian
idol
squatted
on
the
front
seat
of
an
automobile
but
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
have
been
other
gods
in
cars
i
only
hope
if
i
to
be
behind
him
this
one
wo
behave
like
juggernaut
he
wears
almost
too
many
clothes
for
he
is
the
type
that
would
look
in
a
bangle
we
might
have
an
eight
or
ten
weeks
run
about
england
the
dragon
went
on
while
things
are
being
made
straight
at
graylees
it
would
be
good
to
see
something
of
the
blessed
old
island
again
before
settling
down
one
would
think
you
were
quite
pleased
at
the
fire
lionel
remarked
his
sister
who
evidently
believes
it
wrong
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
and
right
to
expect
the
worst
like
an
undertaker
calling
for
a
client
before
he
dead
what
is
is
returned
he
we
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
you
would
mind
a
motor
tour
would
you
emily
i
would
go
if
it
were
my
duty
and
you
desired
it
she
said
looking
as
if
she
ought
to
be
on
stained
glass
with
half
a
halo
only
i
am
hardly
young
enough
to
consider
motoring
as
a
pleasure
there
are
many
years
between
us
replied
her
brother
too
polite
to
say
whether
he
were
in
front
or
behind
but
i
confess
i
do
regard
it
as
a
pleasure
a
man
is
different
she
admitted
thank
goodness
he
is
then
they
talked
more
about
the
fire
which
it
seems
happened
through
something
being
wrong
with
a
flue
in
a
room
where
had
told
a
servant
to
build
a
fire
on
account
of
dampness
it
must
be
a
wonderful
old
place
from
what
they
both
let
drop
i
told
you
in
another
letter
how
sir
lionel
had
inherited
it
about
the
same
time
as
his
title
or
a
little
later
the
estate
though
comes
from
the
mother
side
and
her
people
were
from
warwickshire
his
cool
british
way
of
saying
and
taking
things
is
a
good
deal
on
the
surface
i
think
he
would
have
hated
us
to
see
it
but
i
sure
he
worked
himself
up
to
quite
a
pitch
of
joyful
excitement
over
the
idea
of
the
motor
trip
as
it
developed
in
his
mind
and
it
is
splendid
is
it
darling
you
know
how
sorry
you
were
we
had
been
more
economical
and
made
our
money
last
long
enough
to
travel
in
england
instead
of
having
to
stop
short
after
a
splash
in
london
now
i
going
to
see
bits
in
spite
of
all
until
i
called
away
and
i
try
my
best
in
letters
to
make
you
see
what
i
do
ellaline
would
have
enjoyed
such
a
tour
for
she
hates
the
country
or
any
place
where
it
is
suitable
to
wear
high
heels
and
picture
hats
but
i
oh
i
twenty
dragons
on
the
same
seat
of
the
car
with
me
could
prevent
my
revelling
in
it
though
it
may
be
cut
short
for
me
at
any
minute
as
for
norton
but
the
stewardess
has
just
said
we
shall
be
in
in
five
minutes
i
had
to
come
down
to
the
ladies
cabin
with
now
i
have
time
to
tell
you
any
more
except
that
they
both
sir
and
his
sister
i
mean
wanted
to
get
to
england
as
soon
as
possible
i
know
was
disappointed
not
to
fling
her
brother
ward
back
to
madame
de
maluet
and
probably
would
have
come
over
to
paris
if
she
had
hoped
to
bring
it
off
but
she
resigns
herself
to
things
easily
when
a
man
says
they
best
it
was
sir
lionel
who
wanted
particularly
to
cross
though
he
did
urge
it
but
she
said
very
well
dear
i
think
you
right
so
here
we
are
a
large
bell
is
ringing
and
so
is
my
heart
i
mean
beating
dearest
i
write
again
or
rather
for
it
a
lovely
sunrise
like
a
good
omen
when
we
get
settled
somewhere
i
believe
we
going
to
a
london
hotel
yes
stewardess
oh
i
ought
to
have
said
that
to
her
instead
of
writing
it
to
you
she
interrupted
love
love
audrie
ellaline
v
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
hotel
angel
may
your
wings
never
moult
i
hope
you
did
think
me
extravagant
wiring
yesterday
instead
of
writing
i
was
too
busy
baking
the
yeasty
dough
of
my
impressions
to
write
a
letter
worth
reading
and
when
one
has
practically
money
what
the
good
of
being
economical
you
know
the
sole
point
of
sympathy
i
ever
touched
with
sissy
williams
was
his
famous
speech
if
i
ca
earn
five
hundred
a
year
it
not
worth
while
worrying
to
earn
anything
which
excused
his
settling
down
as
a
remittance
man
in
the
top
flat
at
forty
francs
a
month
dearest
the
dragon
has
once
yet
and
by
the
way
till
he
does
so
i
think
i
wo
call
him
dragon
again
it
rather
gratuitous
as
i
eating
his
bread
or
rather
his
perfectly
gorgeous
la
and
am
literally
smeared
with
luxury
from
my
rising
up
until
my
lying
down
at
his
expense
i
know
and
you
know
because
i
repeated
it
word
for
word
that
ellaline
said
she
thought
he
must
have
been
well
paid
for
undertaking
to
guardian
her
as
his
hard
selfish
type
does
nothing
for
nothing
and
she
has
always
seemed
so
very
rich
quite
heiress
of
the
school
envied
for
her
dresses
and
privileges
that
there
might
be
temptations
for
an
unscrupulous
man
to
pick
up
a
few
plums
here
and
there
but
well
of
course
ellaline
ought
to
know
after
being
his
ward
ever
since
she
was
four
and
hearing
things
on
the
best
authority
about
the
horrid
way
he
treated
her
mother
as
well
as
suffering
from
his
cruel
heartlessness
all
these
years
never
a
letter
written
to
herself
never
the
least
little
present
never
a
wish
to
hear
from
her
or
see
her
photograph
all
business
carried
on
between
himself
and
madame
de
maluet
who
is
too
discreet
to
prejudice
a
ward
against
a
guardian
and
i
i
saw
him
only
day
before
yesterday
for
the
first
time
what
i
know
about
him
i
no
experience
in
reading
characters
of
men
the
dear
old
abbé
and
a
few
masters
in
the
school
are
the
only
ones
i
have
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
except
sissy
williams
who
does
count
it
dangerous
to
trust
to
one
instincts
no
doubt
for
it
so
difficult
to
be
sure
a
wish
is
disguising
itself
as
instinct
in
rouge
and
a
golden
wig
but
then
there
the
man
profile
which
is
of
the
crusader
pattern
a
regular
hook
to
hang
respect
upon
though
i
be
doing
it
injustice
if
i
let
you
imagine
it
like
a
hook
it
is
it
quite
beautiful
and
you
find
yourself
furtively
sketching
it
in
air
with
your
forefinger
as
you
look
at
it
it
suggests
race
and
and
a
long
line
of
soldier
ancestors
and
that
sort
of
thing
such
as
you
used
to
say
survived
visibly
among
the
english
aristocracy
and
english
peasantry
not
in
the
middle
classes
more
markedly
than
anywhere
else
that
must
mean
some
correspondence
in
character
must
it
or
can
it
be
a
mask
handed
down
by
noble
ancestry
to
cover
up
moral
defects
in
a
degenerate
descendant
am
i
gabbling
gush
or
am
i
groping
toward
light
you
know
what
i
want
to
say
anyhow
the
impression
sir
lionel
pendragon
makes
on
me
would
be
different
if
he
had
been
described
by
ellaline
i
should
have
supposed
him
quite
easy
to
read
if
he
happened
upon
me
unheralded
as
a
big
ship
looms
over
a
little
bark
on
the
high
sea
have
thought
him
a
simple
enough
straightforward
character
in
that
case
i
should
have
put
him
in
the
class
with
his
own
tudor
castle
not
that
i
ever
yet
seen
a
tudor
castle
except
in
photographs
or
on
postcards
but
i
have
said
to
myself
if
he
been
born
a
house
instead
of
a
man
he
have
been
built
centuries
and
centuries
ago
by
strong
barons
who
knew
exactly
what
they
wanted
and
grabbed
it
have
been
a
castle
an
tudor
castle
battlemented
and
surrounded
by
a
moat
fortified
of
course
and
impregnable
to
the
enemy
unless
they
treacherously
blew
him
up
he
would
have
had
several
secret
rooms
but
they
would
contain
chests
of
treasure
not
nasty
skeletons
now
you
understand
exactly
what
i
be
thinking
of
the
alleged
dragon
if
it
were
for
ellaline
but
as
it
is
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
him
that
why
i
describe
him
as
elaborate
and
complicated
because
i
suppose
he
must
be
totally
different
inside
from
what
he
seems
outside
anyhow
i
do
care
it
lovely
being
at
the
ritz
and
we
in
the
newspapers
this
morning
emily
and
i
shining
by
reflected
light
mine
doubly
reflected
like
the
earth
light
shining
on
to
the
moon
and
from
that
being
passed
on
to
something
else
some
poor
little
chipped
meteorite
strayed
out
of
the
milky
way
it
was
norton
who
discovered
the
article
about
sir
lionel
half
a
column
in
the
and
she
sent
out
for
lots
of
other
papers
without
saying
anything
to
her
brother
for
according
to
her
he
hates
that
sort
of
thing
i
did
have
time
to
tell
you
in
my
last
that
she
was
sick
crossing
the
channel
though
it
was
as
smooth
as
if
it
had
been
ironed
and
only
a
few
wrinkles
left
in
but
apparently
she
considers
it
good
form
for
a
female
to
be
slightly
ill
in
a
ladylike
way
on
boats
so
of
course
she
is
and
as
i
was
decent
to
her
she
decided
to
like
me
better
than
she
thought
she
would
at
first
for
some
reason
they
seemed
prejudiced
against
me
i
mean
against
ellaline
to
begin
with
i
think
why
and
slowly
with
unconcealable
surprise
they
are
changing
their
minds
changing
one
mind
keeps
one
soul
nice
and
clean
and
fresh
so
theirs
will
be
well
aired
owing
to
me
emily
has
become
quite
resigned
to
my
existence
and
doles
me
out
small
confidences
she
has
not
a
rich
nature
to
begin
with
and
it
has
never
been
fertilized
much
so
it
rather
sterile
but
no
noxious
weeds
anyhow
as
there
be
in
sir
lionel
more
generous
and
cultivated
soil
i
think
i
shall
get
on
with
her
pretty
well
after
all
especially
motoring
when
i
can
take
her
with
plenty
of
ozone
she
is
a
little
afraid
of
her
brother
though
he
five
years
younger
than
she
i
now
learned
but
extremely
proud
of
him
and
it
was
quite
pathetic
her
cutting
out
the
stuff
about
him
in
the
papers
this
morning
and
showing
every
bit
to
me
before
pasting
all
in
a
book
she
has
been
keeping
for
years
entirely
concerned
with
sir
lionel
she
says
she
will
show
that
to
me
too
some
day
but
i
must
tell
him
as
if
i
would
but
about
the
newspapers
she
did
order
any
radical
ones
because
she
said
they
were
always
down
on
the
aristocracy
and
unjust
as
well
as
stupid
but
she
got
one
by
mistake
and
you
no
idea
how
delighted
the
poor
little
woman
was
when
it
praised
her
brother
up
to
the
skies
then
she
said
there
were
decent
radicals
after
all
of
course
one
knows
the
difference
between
mirabeau
judged
by
his
friends
and
mirabeau
judged
by
the
people
and
can
make
allowances
if
one
digestion
good
for
points
of
view
but
there
one
thing
certain
whether
he
angel
or
devil
or
something
hybrid
between
the
two
sir
lionel
pendragon
is
a
man
of
importance
in
the
public
eye
i
wonder
if
ellaline
realizes
his
importance
in
that
way
i
ca
think
she
does
or
she
would
have
mentioned
it
as
it
need
have
interfered
with
her
opinion
of
his
private
character
it
a
little
through
emily
but
mostly
from
the
newspaper
cuttings
that
i
got
my
knowledge
of
what
he
done
and
been
and
is
expected
to
be
he
forty
i
know
that
because
the
gave
the
date
of
his
birth
and
he
rather
a
swell
although
only
a
baronet
and
not
even
that
till
a
short
time
ago
it
appears
that
the
family
on
both
sides
goes
back
into
the
mists
of
antiquity
in
the
days
when
legend
handed
down
by
word
of
mouth
you
hand
things
out
of
your
mouth
sounds
rude
was
the
forerunner
of
history
his
father
ancestors
are
supposed
to
be
descended
from
king
arthur
hence
the
pendragon
though
i
suppose
if
it
true
king
arthur
must
really
have
been
married
several
times
as
say
the
vulgar
records
of
which
tennyson
very
properly
takes
no
notice
there
have
been
dukes
and
earls
in
the
family
but
they
have
somehow
disappeared
perhaps
because
in
those
benighted
days
there
were
no
american
heiresses
to
keep
them
up
it
seems
that
sir
lionel
was
a
soldier
to
begin
with
and
was
dreadfully
wounded
in
some
frontier
fight
in
india
when
he
was
very
young
he
nearly
lost
the
use
of
his
left
arm
and
gave
up
the
army
but
he
got
the
victoria
cross
ellaline
did
say
a
word
about
that
maybe
she
does
know
after
i
read
his
dossier
in
the
paper
i
resist
asking
him
at
lunch
what
he
had
done
to
deserve
the
nothing
to
deserve
it
he
answered
looking
surprised
to
get
it
then
i
twisted
my
question
round
oh
i
do
know
almost
forget
pulled
some
silly
ass
out
of
a
hole
i
believe
said
he
that
what
you
get
for
asking
this
sort
of
englishman
questions
about
his
past
i
thought
it
was
only
widows
with
auburn
hair
you
must
talk
to
about
their
pasts
a
grateful
government
according
to
the
sent
young
pendragon
at
the
age
of
to
east
bengal
as
private
secretary
to
sir
john
hurley
who
was
at
that
time
and
it
an
ill
governor
so
to
speak
who
blows
no
one
any
good
sir
john
liver
was
so
tired
of
bengal
that
he
had
to
take
it
away
and
lieutenant
pendragon
as
he
was
then
looked
after
things
till
another
man
could
arrive
he
looked
after
them
so
brilliantly
that
when
the
next
did
something
silly
and
was
asked
to
resign
our
incipient
sir
lionel
was
invited
to
take
on
the
job
he
was
only
thirty
and
so
he
has
been
for
ten
years
now
going
to
see
whether
he
likes
being
a
baronet
better
and
having
castles
and
all
the
papers
i
saw
praised
him
tremendously
and
said
that
in
a
crisis
which
might
have
been
disastrous
he
had
averted
a
catastrophe
by
his
remarkable
strength
of
character
and
presence
of
mind
i
suppose
that
was
the
time
when
the
other
papers
accused
him
of
abominable
cruelties
i
wonder
which
was
right
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
judge
sooner
or
later
if
i
watch
at
the
loopholes
of
his
character
like
a
cat
watching
for
a
mouse
to
come
out
for
a
walk
as
for
money
if
one
can
believe
newspapers
he
has
plenty
without
shaking
pennies
from
the
slot
of
ellaline
lethbridge
bank
and
was
fairly
well
off
even
before
he
came
in
for
his
title
or
his
castle
however
as
a
very
young
man
he
may
have
been
poor
about
the
time
he
went
into
guardianship
by
the
way
the
left
arm
seems
all
right
now
anyhow
he
uses
it
as
arms
are
meant
to
be
used
so
far
as
i
can
see
so
evidently
it
improved
with
time
the
papers
tell
about
his
coming
back
to
england
and
his
warwickshire
castle
and
the
fire
and
norton
giving
up
her
house
in
some
county
or
other
i
already
forgotten
which
to
live
with
her
distinguished
brother
also
they
say
that
he
has
a
ward
whose
mother
was
a
relative
of
the
family
and
whose
father
was
the
honourable
frederic
lethbridge
so
well
known
and
popular
in
society
during
the
late
eighties
ellaline
was
born
in
what
had
become
of
him
like
to
know
perhaps
he
died
before
she
was
born
she
has
told
me
that
she
ca
remember
him
but
that
about
all
she
has
ever
said
of
her
father
we
are
to
stay
at
the
ritz
until
we
start
off
on
the
motor
trip
which
is
actually
going
to
happen
though
i
was
afraid
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
the
new
car
wo
be
ready
for
a
week
though
i
am
sorry
but
norton
is
she
is
afraid
she
will
be
killed
and
thinks
it
will
be
a
messy
sort
of
death
to
die
besides
she
likes
london
she
says
her
brother
will
be
overwhelmed
with
invitations
but
he
hates
society
and
loathes
being
lionized
imagine
the
man
smothered
under
stacks
of
perfumed
notes
as
tarpeia
was
under
the
shields
and
bracelets
emily
has
not
lived
in
london
because
she
wanted
to
be
in
a
place
where
she
particularly
valued
the
vicar
and
the
doctor
but
she
has
given
them
up
for
her
brother
now
and
is
only
going
to
write
her
symptoms
spiritual
and
physical
she
enjoys
church
more
than
anything
else
but
thinks
it
will
be
her
duty
to
take
me
about
a
little
while
we
in
town
as
her
brother
is
sure
not
to
because
he
spurns
women
and
is
not
interested
in
anything
they
do
i
suppose
she
must
know
and
yet
at
lunch
yesterday
he
asked
if
we
were
too
tired
or
if
we
should
like
to
do
a
few
theatres
i
said
because
i
simply
to
spare
them
a
shock
later
that
i
was
afraid
i
had
anything
nice
to
wear
i
felt
myself
go
red
for
it
was
a
sort
of
disgrace
to
ellaline
but
he
did
seem
as
much
surprised
as
norton
did
her
eyebrows
went
up
but
he
only
said
of
course
school
girls
never
had
smart
frocks
and
i
must
buy
a
few
dresses
at
once
one
evening
gown
would
be
enough
for
a
young
girl
norton
said
but
he
did
agree
with
her
he
said
he
had
thought
about
it
but
now
that
it
occurred
to
him
he
was
of
opinion
that
women
should
have
plenty
of
nice
things
then
when
she
told
him
rather
hurriedly
that
she
would
choose
me
something
ready
made
at
a
good
shop
in
oxford
street
he
remarked
that
he
always
understood
bond
street
was
the
place
not
for
school
girls
explained
dear
emily
who
is
a
canny
person
she
is
a
school
girl
now
that
finished
said
sir
lionel
and
as
she
thinks
him
a
tin
god
on
wheels
she
ceased
to
argue
by
the
by
he
has
the
air
of
hating
to
call
me
by
name
he
says
miss
lethbridge
in
a
curious
stiff
kind
of
way
when
he
absolutely
obliged
to
give
me
a
label
otherwise
he
compromises
with
you
to
which
he
confines
himself
when
possible
it
rather
odd
and
ca
be
an
accident
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
is
that
he
may
feel
it
is
really
his
duty
to
call
me
ellaline
i
promised
to
write
to
ellaline
as
soon
as
i
anything
to
tell
worth
telling
and
i
suppose
i
must
do
it
yet
i
dread
to
and
make
up
my
mind
to
begin
i
do
like
to
praise
a
person
whom
she
regards
as
a
monster
still
i
nothing
to
say
against
him
and
sure
she
be
cross
if
i
do
run
him
down
i
think
i
shall
state
facts
baldly
when
i
get
instalments
of
allowance
intended
for
ellaline
of
course
i
am
to
send
the
money
to
her
except
just
enough
not
to
be
noticeably
penniless
i
to
address
her
as
mademoiselle
leonie
de
nesville
and
send
letters
to
poste
restante
because
while
i
known
as
miss
lethbridge
it
might
seem
queer
if
i
posted
envelopes
directed
to
a
person
of
my
own
name
it
was
ellaline
who
suggested
that
not
i
she
thought
of
everything
though
she
such
a
child
in
some
ways
she
marvellous
at
scheming
i
really
ca
think
yet
what
i
say
to
her
it
worrying
me
i
feel
guilty
somehow
i
do
know
why
norton
suggested
taking
me
out
shopping
and
this
afternoon
sir
lionel
proposed
going
with
us
his
sister
was
astonished
and
so
was
i
especially
after
what
she
had
said
about
his
not
being
interested
in
women
affairs
just
to
make
sure
that
you
take
my
tip
about
bond
street
he
remarked
and
bond
street
used
to
amuse
me
when
i
was
twenty
i
think
it
will
amuse
me
now
to
see
how
it
and
i
have
changed
so
we
are
going
all
three
rather
awful
about
the
gray
serge
and
sailor
hat
is
it
i
felt
in
them
at
versailles
and
even
in
paris
because
there
i
was
a
singing
teacher
in
other
words
nobody
but
in
london
i
supposed
to
be
an
heiress
and
here
at
the
ritz
such
beautiful
beings
come
to
lunch
in
dresses
which
they
have
evidently
been
poured
into
with
consummate
skill
and
incredible
expense
i
tasted
for
the
first
time
it
made
me
wish
for
you
but
it
did
seem
to
go
at
all
with
gray
serge
and
a
cotton
blouse
i
ought
to
have
been
a
gorgeous
being
with
silk
linings
how
am
i
to
support
the
shopping
ordeal
supposing
norton
chooses
me
things
oh
horror
they
sure
to
be
hideous
but
they
may
be
costly
as
it
says
in
an
english
society
paper
which
madame
de
maluet
takes
what
should
a
do
if
only
telepathy
were
a
going
concern
you
would
answer
that
hard
case
for
your
poor
puzzled
alias
nothing
more
heard
or
seen
of
the
white
girl
burden
richard
of
that
ilk
i
was
afraid
of
his
turning
up
at
the
grand
hotel
in
paris
or
even
at
the
station
to
see
us
off
but
he
did
he
has
disappeared
into
space
and
is
welcome
to
the
whole
of
it
i
should
nearly
have
forgotten
him
if
i
did
wonder
sometimes
what
his
mysterious
profession
is
vi
sir
lionel
pendragon
to
colonel
at
droita
east
bengal
hotel
my
dear
pat
you
were
right
i
was
wrong
it
good
to
be
in
england
again
your
prophecy
has
come
true
the
dead
past
has
pretty
well
buried
its
dead
a
few
dry
bones
show
under
the
surface
here
and
there
i
let
them
lie
is
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
dig
up
buried
bones
as
you
know
i
was
ass
enough
to
dread
arriving
in
paris
i
dreaded
it
throughout
the
whole
voyage
when
i
got
to
marseilles
i
found
a
wire
from
emily
saying
she
would
meet
me
in
paris
ass
again
i
had
an
idea
she
was
putting
herself
to
that
trouble
with
the
kindly
wish
to
stand
by
and
take
my
thoughts
off
old
days
but
i
might
have
known
better
knowing
that
good
practical
little
soul
she
had
quite
another
object
came
to
break
the
news
of
a
fire
at
graylees
but
it
seems
not
to
have
done
any
serious
damage
except
to
have
wiped
out
a
few
modern
frills
they
can
easily
be
tacked
on
again
i
glad
it
was
no
worse
for
i
love
graylees
i
might
have
turned
out
a
less
decent
sort
of
chap
than
i
am
if
it
had
been
for
the
prospect
of
inheriting
it
sooner
or
later
one
has
to
live
up
to
certain
things
and
graylees
was
an
incentive
you
asked
me
to
tell
you
if
emily
had
changed
well
she
has
eighteen
years
since
you
saw
her
fifteen
since
i
did
i
must
tell
you
honestly
you
have
no
sentimental
regrets
if
you
could
see
her
now
you
will
remember
if
you
not
too
gallant
that
she
was
three
years
older
than
you
the
three
seem
to
have
stretched
to
a
dozen
luckily
you
did
let
norton
snatching
emily
from
under
your
nose
prey
upon
cheek
or
heart
nothing
is
damaged
you
are
sound
and
whole
and
that
is
why
your
friendship
has
been
such
a
boon
to
me
you
have
saved
me
from
tilting
against
many
windmills
i
suppose
you
think
i
preambling
now
to
put
off
the
evil
moment
of
telling
you
about
ellaline
de
nesville
girl
but
no
for
once
you
mistaken
in
me
after
all
it
is
an
evil
moment
i
surprised
at
myself
doubly
surprised
at
the
girl
and
both
surprises
are
agreeable
ones
i
do
ask
you
if
you
remember
ellaline
for
nobody
who
ever
saw
her
could
forget
her
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
after
all
these
years
and
all
the
changes
in
myself
as
i
am
now
hers
is
the
last
type
with
which
i
should
fall
in
love
provided
i
were
fool
enough
to
lose
my
head
for
anyone
yet
i
ca
wonder
at
the
adoration
i
gave
her
she
was
exactly
the
sort
of
girl
to
call
out
a
boy
love
and
she
had
all
mine
poor
foolish
wretch
that
i
was
there
nothing
more
pathetic
i
think
at
this
distance
than
a
boy
passionate
purity
in
his
first
love
unless
it
his
disillusionment
for
disillusion
does
no
nature
good
it
would
have
done
mine
great
harm
if
i
had
had
a
friend
like
you
to
groan
and
grumble
to
you
understand
how
i
always
felt
about
this
child
she
wished
me
to
care
for
i
was
certain
that
ellaline
number
would
grow
up
as
like
ellaline
number
as
this
summer
rose
is
like
last
summer
which
bloomed
on
the
same
bush
at
four
years
old
the
little
thing
undoubtedly
had
a
dollish
resemblance
to
her
mother
i
thought
i
remembered
that
she
had
the
first
great
dark
eyes
full
of
incipient
coquetry
and
curly
black
lashes
which
the
little
flirt
already
knew
how
to
use
by
instinct
the
same
sort
of
mouth
too
which
to
look
at
makes
a
boy
believe
in
a
personal
cupid
and
a
man
in
a
personal
devil
i
had
a
dim
recollection
of
hair
falling
around
a
tiny
face
shaped
like
ellaline
we
used
to
call
it
emily
and
i
when
we
were
both
under
our
little
french
cousin
thumb
in
the
oldest
days
of
all
before
even
emily
began
to
find
her
out
i
wonder
if
a
child
sheds
its
first
hair
like
its
first
teeth
never
given
much
thought
to
infantine
phenomena
of
any
kind
still
inclined
to
believe
now
that
there
must
be
such
cases
of
course
we
know
a
type
of
blond
née
brunette
for
instance
senter
young
burden
fascinating
aunt
whom
we
suspected
of
having
turned
blond
in
a
single
night
by
the
way
whom
should
i
run
across
in
paris
but
dicky
grown
up
more
or
less
since
he
chaperoned
his
female
belongings
in
the
far
east
but
i
not
talking
of
the
senters
of
the
world
talking
of
ellaline
unexpected
daughter
she
has
changed
almost
incredibly
between
the
ages
of
four
and
nineteen
before
i
knew
emily
intended
meeting
me
in
paris
i
wrote
the
asking
that
my
ward
might
be
sent
well
chaperoned
to
the
gare
de
lyon
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
to
face
a
modern
young
female
adorned
with
all
the
latest
improvements
and
parlour
tricks
it
would
have
been
worse
to
face
several
dozens
of
these
creatures
in
their
lair
therefore
i
funked
collecting
my
ward
at
versailles
i
was
to
know
her
by
a
rose
pinned
on
her
frock
in
case
she
altered
past
recognition
it
was
well
as
things
turned
out
that
i
made
the
suggestion
otherwise
the
girl
would
have
had
to
go
back
to
versailles
like
an
unclaimed
parcel
and
that
would
have
been
bad
as
she
had
no
chaperon
something
had
happened
to
the
lady
or
to
the
lady
relatives
i
almost
forget
what
now
instead
of
the
dainty
little
tanagra
figure
in
smart
french
frills
which
i
expected
there
was
a
tall
beautiful
young
person
with
the
bearing
of
an
atalanta
and
the
clothes
of
a
quakeress
she
tacked
my
name
on
to
the
wrong
man
or
i
should
have
let
her
go
in
spite
of
the
rose
so
different
was
she
from
what
i
expected
and
you
be
amused
to
hear
that
her
idea
of
lionel
pendragon
was
embodied
by
old
hannibal
jones
who
got
into
my
train
at
marseilles
he
taken
to
parting
his
name
in
the
middle
now
and
is
general
she
ought
to
have
known
my
age
approximately
or
could
have
learned
it
if
she
cared
to
bother
but
i
suppose
to
nineteen
forty
might
as
well
be
sixty
that
a
thing
to
remember
if
one
feels
the
sap
pulsing
in
branches
just
to
remind
one
that
after
all
it
not
spring
but
autumn
and
at
the
present
moment
by
the
way
i
not
sure
that
i
sha
need
this
kind
of
taking
down
a
peg
for
i
am
feeling
so
young
that
i
think
i
must
be
growing
old
i
have
begun
to
value
what
left
me
of
youth
to
take
it
out
and
look
at
it
in
all
lights
like
a
fruit
which
must
be
gloated
over
before
it
decays
and
that
a
fatal
sign
eh
i
have
the
most
extraordinary
interest
in
life
which
i
attribute
to
the
new
which
will
be
finished
and
ready
to
use
in
a
few
days
also
to
the
thought
that
graylees
is
my
own
but
i
wandering
away
from
the
girl
she
is
as
unlike
ellaline
de
nesville
as
one
beautifully
bound
first
volume
of
a
human
document
can
be
from
another
equally
attractive
first
volume
of
a
human
document
is
inexpressive
of
a
young
girl
is
it
heaven
knows
what
this
one
may
be
by
the
time
the
second
and
third
volumes
are
ready
for
publication
but
at
present
one
turns
over
the
leaves
with
pleased
surprise
there
something
original
and
charming
in
each
new
page
her
first
hair
must
have
been
shed
for
the
present
lot
and
there
is
a
lot
is
of
a
bright
yellowy
brown
looks
like
a
child
hair
somehow
there
are
little
rings
and
kinks
about
it
which
i
take
to
have
been
put
there
by
the
of
nature
though
i
may
be
mistaken
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
deceived
myself
about
the
child
eyes
for
they
are
not
black
but
of
a
grayish
hazel
which
can
look
brown
or
violet
at
night
she
is
a
tall
young
thing
slim
and
straight
as
a
sapling
with
frank
honest
manners
which
are
singularly
engaging
i
look
at
her
in
amazement
and
interest
and
find
her
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
which
i
am
not
able
to
make
out
i
hardly
dare
let
myself
go
in
liking
her
for
fear
of
disappointment
she
seems
too
good
to
be
true
too
good
to
last
i
keep
wondering
what
ancestress
of
ellaline
de
nesville
or
fred
lethbridge
is
gazing
out
of
those
azure
windows
which
are
this
girl
eyes
if
fred
soul
or
ellaline
peeps
from
behind
the
clear
bright
panes
it
contrives
to
keep
itself
well
hidden
so
far
but
i
expect
anything
i
had
no
notion
until
now
that
a
young
woman
could
be
a
delightful
pal
for
a
man
especially
a
man
of
my
age
perhaps
this
is
my
ignorance
of
the
sex
for
i
admit
i
locked
up
the
book
of
woman
and
never
opened
it
again
since
the
chapter
of
ellaline
or
it
may
be
that
girls
have
changed
since
the
brave
days
when
we
were
at
that
remote
epoch
as
far
as
i
can
discover
by
blowing
off
the
dust
from
faded
souvenirs
one
either
made
love
to
girls
or
one
did
they
were
there
to
dance
with
and
flirt
with
and
go
on
the
river
with
not
to
talk
politics
to
or
exchange
opinions
of
the
universe
they
the
prettiest
ones
would
have
thought
that
valuable
time
was
being
wasted
in
such
discussions
yet
here
is
this
girl
not
twenty
a
child
fresh
from
school
a
french
school
at
that
radiant
with
the
power
of
her
youth
her
beauty
her
femininity
yet
she
seems
actually
interested
in
problems
of
life
unconnected
with
love
affairs
she
appears
to
like
talking
sense
and
she
has
humour
far
more
subtle
than
the
mere
kittenish
sense
of
fun
which
belongs
to
her
years
or
lack
of
them
i
dreaded
the
responsibility
of
her
but
i
dreaded
much
more
being
bored
by
her
flirted
with
by
her
i
hanged
if
i
could
have
stood
that
from
the
kind
of
girl
i
was
prepared
to
see
but
as
i
said
i
found
a
pal
if
i
dared
believe
in
her
instead
of
avoiding
my
ward
society
and
shoving
it
on
to
emily
as
i
intended
i
excuse
myself
to
myself
for
contriving
pretexts
to
bask
in
it
for
instance
what
do
you
think
i
did
a
shopping
expedition
was
in
question
emily
who
never
had
much
taste
in
dress
and
now
clothes
herself
as
if
in
punishment
for
sin
seems
to
know
when
other
women
are
badly
turned
out
she
thinks
it
right
that
young
girls
should
be
simply
dressed
but
considers
that
in
the
case
of
ellaline
simplicity
has
been
carried
too
far
you
see
she
does
know
what
you
and
i
know
about
that
wretched
fellow
lethbridge
end
and
she
believes
his
daughter
has
plenty
of
money
or
will
have
on
coming
of
age
naturally
i
undeceive
her
emily
is
a
good
soul
but
in
questions
of
money
and
if
she
knew
the
truth
she
might
be
inclined
to
hold
the
tight
she
might
even
be
tempted
to
hint
something
distressing
to
this
poor
girl
if
the
child
vexed
her
by
any
thoughtless
little
extravagance
whereas
i
would
for
a
good
deal
have
daughter
guess
she
owes
anything
to
me
emily
offered
to
choose
frocks
for
miss
lethbridge
whereupon
that
young
lady
cast
such
a
comical
glance
of
despair
at
me
a
glance
which
i
think
was
involuntary
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
burst
out
laughing
i
saw
so
well
what
was
in
her
mind
and
if
you
will
believe
me
i
volunteered
to
go
with
them
having
committed
myself
i
had
all
the
sensations
of
a
fly
caught
on
a
sheet
of
tanglefoot
or
a
prisoner
of
war
chained
to
a
roman
chariot
but
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
myself
hugely
nothing
better
has
happened
to
me
since
i
used
to
be
taken
to
look
at
the
toyshops
the
day
before
christmas
no
not
even
my
first
pantomime
could
beat
this
as
an
experience
emily
economical
soul
clamoured
for
oxford
street
i
stood
out
for
bond
and
got
my
way
you
will
grin
here
you
say
i
always
do
get
my
way
my
idea
was
to
make
of
myself
a
kind
of
last
resort
or
court
of
appeal
i
meant
to
let
emily
advise
but
to
sweep
her
aside
if
she
perpetrated
atrocities
the
first
shop
however
went
to
my
head
it
was
one
of
those
where
you
walk
into
a
kind
of
with
figurines
or
whatever
you
call
them
slender
headless
ladies
in
model
dresses
grouped
about
and
other
equally
slender
but
ladies
in
black
satin
trains
showing
off
their
dummy
sisters
it
was
the
figurines
that
intoxicated
me
i
saw
ellaline
head
in
imagination
coming
out
at
the
top
of
all
the
prettiest
dresses
they
were
wonderfully
simple
too
the
most
attractive
ones
seemed
just
the
thing
for
a
young
girl
emily
walked
past
them
as
if
they
were
vulgar
acquaintances
trying
to
catch
her
eye
at
a
duchess
ball
but
they
trapped
me
there
was
a
white
thing
for
the
street
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
ellaline
and
a
blue
fluff
cut
low
in
the
neck
exactly
the
right
colour
to
show
up
her
hair
then
there
was
a
film
of
pink
with
wreaths
of
little
rosebuds
dotted
about
made
me
think
of
spring
i
told
you
i
lost
my
head
did
i
i
stopped
my
ward
pointed
out
these
things
to
her
and
asked
her
if
she
liked
them
she
said
she
did
but
they
would
be
horribly
expensive
she
would
think
of
buying
such
dreams
with
that
up
swam
one
of
the
satin
ladies
whose
back
view
was
precisely
like
that
of
a
wet
black
codfish
with
a
long
tail
i
believe
she
was
directoire
and
hovering
near
on
a
sea
of
carpet
she
volunteered
the
information
that
these
little
frocks
were
poems
singularly
suited
to
the
style
of
i
expected
her
to
say
my
daughter
instead
of
which
however
she
finished
her
sentence
with
a
madam
that
brought
a
blush
to
my
face
i
was
the
only
one
concerned
who
did
blush
however
i
assure
you
the
girl
smiled
into
my
eyes
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
and
minded
not
at
all
a
former
generation
would
have
simpered
but
this
young
person
has
a
simper
in
her
i
said
nonsense
she
could
well
afford
the
dresses
she
argued
and
emily
returned
to
help
her
form
up
a
hollow
square
they
were
both
against
me
but
i
insisted
and
the
codfish
was
a
powerful
ally
would
they
fit
you
i
asked
the
girl
yes
they
would
fit
me
i
dare
say
but
that
settled
it
we
take
them
said
i
and
after
that
being
beside
myself
i
reconnoitred
the
place
pointing
my
stick
at
other
things
which
took
my
fancy
the
codfish
backed
me
up
at
every
step
and
other
codfishes
swam
the
green
sea
with
hats
doubtless
brought
from
unseen
coral
caves
most
of
them
were
enormous
hats
but
remarkably
attractive
in
one
way
or
another
with
large
drooping
brims
that
dripped
roses
or
frothed
with
ostrich
plumes
i
made
ellaline
take
off
a
small
round
butter
plate
she
had
on
which
was
ugly
in
itself
though
somehow
it
looked
like
a
saint
halo
on
her
and
murmuring
compliments
on
madam
hair
the
siren
codfishes
tried
on
one
hat
after
another
i
bought
all
without
asking
the
prices
because
each
one
was
more
becoming
to
the
girl
than
its
predecessor
and
not
to
have
all
would
have
been
like
deliberately
destroying
so
many
original
gainsboroughs
or
sir
joshuas
the
child
hair
by
the
way
is
extraordinarily
vital
it
spouts
up
in
two
thick
bright
billows
over
her
white
forehead
like
the
beginning
of
a
strong
fountain
a
very
agreeable
foundation
for
a
hat
seeing
that
i
had
gone
mad
the
wily
codfishes
took
advantage
of
my
state
and
flourished
things
before
my
eyes
at
which
emily
instantly
forbade
me
to
look
it
is
true
that
they
were
objects
not
often
seen
by
bachelor
man
except
in
shop
windows
and
on
the
advertising
pages
of
women
magazines
but
silk
petticoats
and
cobwebby
lace
frills
have
no
gorgon
qualities
and
i
was
not
turned
to
stone
by
the
sight
of
them
i
even
found
courage
to
ask
of
the
company
at
large
if
they
were
the
sort
of
thing
that
young
ladies
ought
to
have
in
their
wardrobes
the
answer
was
emphatically
in
the
affirmative
have
you
already
got
all
you
want
of
them
or
could
you
make
use
of
more
i
inquired
of
my
ward
i
should
know
myself
in
such
miracles
said
she
with
a
kind
of
gasp
her
eyes
very
bright
and
her
cheeks
pinker
than
they
had
been
when
she
was
suspected
of
bridehood
she
was
still
suspected
of
it
indeed
i
think
that
in
the
minds
of
the
black
satin
codfishes
circumstantial
evidence
had
tinkered
suspicion
into
certainty
but
ellaline
was
deaf
to
the
madam
they
might
have
turned
her
from
wife
into
widow
without
her
noticing
she
was
burning
with
the
desire
to
possess
those
embroidered
cobwebs
and
those
frilled
petticoats
i
know
why
she
should
have
been
more
excited
about
garments
which
few
if
any
save
herself
would
see
after
she
put
them
on
than
she
was
about
those
on
which
cats
and
kings
might
gaze
but
so
it
was
i
should
like
to
ask
an
expert
if
this
is
the
case
with
all
females
or
if
it
is
exceptional
send
the
lot
with
the
hats
and
dresses
said
i
and
when
she
widened
her
eyes
and
gasped
i
assured
her
that
i
knew
her
income
better
than
she
did
anything
she
cared
to
have
in
the
way
of
pretty
clothes
she
could
afford
strange
to
say
even
then
she
did
seem
comfortable
she
opened
her
lips
as
if
to
speak
shut
them
hastily
at
the
first
word
swallowed
it
with
difficulty
sighed
and
looked
anxious
i
should
rather
have
liked
to
know
what
was
in
her
mind
we
ended
up
by
the
purchase
of
costumes
suitable
to
the
automobile
both
for
emily
and
ellaline
i
think
women
ought
to
be
as
well
found
for
motoring
as
for
yachting
do
you
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
trip
i
intend
to
take
it
will
be
interesting
to
study
the
impressions
made
upon
this
young
girl
by
england
land
of
history
and
beauty
this
little
world
this
precious
stone
set
in
the
silver
sea
this
england
you
will
laugh
at
me
perhaps
for
my
long
harping
on
my
ward
but
anyhow
do
misunderstand
it
not
because
she
is
pretty
and
engaging
one
would
say
that
of
a
kitten
but
because
of
the
startling
contrast
between
the
real
girl
and
the
girl
of
my
imagination
i
ca
help
thinking
about
her
a
good
deal
for
this
reason
and
what
i
think
of
i
have
generally
talked
of
or
written
of
fully
to
you
my
best
and
oldest
friend
it
a
habit
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
old
and
i
do
mean
to
break
it
now
particularly
as
you
have
made
rather
a
point
of
my
continuing
it
on
my
return
home
after
all
these
years
london
has
got
hold
of
me
i
am
fascinated
by
it
either
it
has
improved
as
it
has
grown
or
i
am
in
a
mood
to
be
pleased
with
anything
english
do
you
remember
dear
old
ennis
rooms
which
you
and
i
used
to
think
the
height
of
luxury
and
gaiety
i
promised
myself
to
go
there
again
and
i
mean
to
take
ellaline
and
emily
to
supper
after
the
theatre
i
think
i
shall
keep
this
letter
open
to
tell
you
how
the
old
place
impresses
me
midnight
and
a
half
i
had
a
shock
ennis
is
dead
as
a
doornail
we
entered
after
the
theatre
and
galvanized
the
rooms
into
a
kind
of
dreadful
life
they
do
serve
many
suppers
now
sir
it
seems
it
mostly
luncheons
and
dinners
the
waiters
resented
us
as
intruders
we
were
the
only
ones
too
which
made
it
worse
as
all
their
rancour
was
visited
on
us
but
we
been
for
many
minutes
at
our
old
favourite
table
the
one
thing
unchanged
trying
to
keep
up
a
spurious
gaiety
when
another
party
of
two
ventured
in
they
were
young
dick
burden
and
his
aunt
senter
now
you
may
see
it
but
this
was
rather
odd
it
would
have
been
odd
in
the
past
to
meet
your
most
intimate
friend
from
round
the
corner
and
the
shah
of
persia
at
ennis
but
evidently
the
people
who
amuse
themselves
do
come
now
it
not
the
thing
why
therefore
should
this
couple
choose
ennis
for
supper
been
out
of
england
for
fifteen
years
like
me
if
senter
occasionally
spends
saturday
to
monday
in
india
or
visits
the
sphinx
when
the
sphinx
is
in
season
she
always
returns
to
london
when
everybody
is
in
town
and
there
does
as
everybody
does
i
immediately
suspected
that
burden
had
brought
her
with
an
object
that
object
to
gain
an
introduction
to
ellaline
the
suspicion
may
seem
but
you
would
pronounce
it
so
if
you
could
have
seen
the
young
man
face
in
the
railway
station
at
paris
the
other
day
i
had
that
privilege
and
i
observed
at
the
time
his
wish
to
know
my
ward
without
feeling
a
responsive
one
to
gratify
it
i
do
know
why
i
did
feel
it
but
i
did
though
the
desire
was
both
pardonable
and
natural
in
the
young
fellow
he
has
a
determined
jaw
therefore
perhaps
it
equally
natural
that
when
disappointed
he
should
persist
even
follow
and
adopt
strong
measures
in
other
words
an
aunt
to
obtain
his
object
you
see
ellaline
is
an
extremely
pretty
girl
and
i
not
alone
in
thinking
so
my
idea
is
that
having
found
us
in
the
newspapers
staying
at
the
ritz
the
boy
must
have
somehow
informed
himself
as
to
our
movements
awaiting
his
opportunity
or
his
aunt
i
bought
my
theatre
tickets
in
the
hotel
he
may
have
got
his
information
from
there
and
the
rest
was
easy
as
far
as
ennis
i
afraid
the
rest
was
too
because
senter
selected
the
table
nearest
ours
and
after
we
had
exchanged
greetings
proposed
that
we
join
parties
the
tables
were
placed
together
and
introductions
all
round
were
a
matter
of
course
young
england
expects
that
every
aunt
will
do
her
duty
they
still
give
you
very
good
food
at
ennis
but
it
rather
like
eating
funeral
baked
meats
senter
is
exactly
what
she
was
some
years
ago
perhaps
it
would
be
ungallant
to
recall
to
your
memory
just
many
years
ago
she
is
if
anything
younger
i
believe
there
a
maxim
once
a
duchess
always
a
duchess
i
think
women
of
have
another
once
thirty
always
thirty
or
once
thirty
always
but
joking
apart
she
is
a
very
agreeable
and
rather
witty
woman
sympathetic
too
apparently
though
i
believe
you
used
to
think
when
she
was
out
smiting
hearts
at
our
back
o
beyond
that
in
nature
she
somewhat
resembled
a
certain
animal
worshipped
by
the
egyptians
and
feared
by
mice
she
seems
very
fond
of
her
nephew
dick
with
whom
she
says
she
goes
about
a
good
deal
we
chaperon
each
other
she
expressed
it
she
pities
me
for
my
fire
at
graylees
but
envies
me
my
motoring
trip
we
shall
be
off
in
a
few
days
now
i
hope
as
soon
as
ellaline
has
been
shown
a
few
features
of
london
i
went
to
see
the
car
and
she
is
a
beauty
i
shall
try
her
for
the
first
time
ever
yours
pen
vii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
hotel
one
and
only
compleat
mother
things
have
happened
i
felt
them
coming
in
my
bones
my
this
time
for
the
things
may
turn
out
to
be
not
at
all
funny
richard
burden
has
been
introduced
to
the
alleged
miss
lethbridge
i
wonder
if
he
know
she
is
merely
the
alleged
he
is
certainly
changed
somehow
both
in
his
manner
and
in
his
of
looking
at
i
thought
in
paris
he
had
at
all
a
bad
face
though
rather
impudent
and
besides
even
man
is
a
fellow
being
but
last
night
for
a
minute
he
really
had
an
incredibly
wicked
expression
or
else
he
was
suppressing
a
sneeze
i
could
be
quite
sure
which
as
you
said
about
aubrey
beardsley
weird
women
it
was
at
a
restaurant
a
piteous
restaurant
where
the
waiters
looked
like
enchanted
waiters
in
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
he
dicky
burden
came
in
with
an
aunt
such
an
aunt
i
could
never
be
at
home
with
her
as
an
aunt
if
i
were
a
man
though
she
might
make
a
bewitching
cousin
she
quite
beautiful
dear
and
graceful
but
i
do
like
her
at
all
i
think
sir
lionel
does
though
they
knew
each
other
in
bengal
and
she
kept
saying
to
him
in
a
cooing
voice
you
remember
you
can
see
she
too
clever
to
be
clever
because
that
bores
people
but
she
says
witty
sharp
things
which
sound
as
if
they
came
out
of
plays
or
books
and
you
think
back
to
see
whether
she
deliberately
led
up
to
them
for
instance
she
asked
sir
lionel
apropos
of
suffrage
whether
on
the
whole
he
preferred
a
man
woman
or
a
woman
woman
what
the
difference
he
wanted
to
know
all
the
difference
between
a
gibson
girl
and
an
ibsen
girl
said
she
i
wonder
if
she
heard
that
or
made
it
up
anyhow
when
sir
lionel
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
in
an
attractive
way
he
has
which
shows
a
dent
in
his
chin
i
wished
said
it
but
the
more
she
flashed
out
bright
things
the
more
of
a
lump
i
was
i
do
think
the
one
unpardonable
sin
is
dulness
and
i
felt
guilty
of
it
she
simply
vampired
me
sucked
my
wits
dry
and
do
you
know
i
afraid
going
on
the
motor
trip
with
us
sir
lionel
does
dream
of
such
a
thing
but
she
does
and
she
the
sort
of
person
whose
dreams
if
they
about
come
true
of
course
i
do
know
her
well
enough
to
hate
her
but
i
feel
it
coming
on
in
books
all
villainesses
who
worth
their
salt
have
little
sharp
teeth
and
pointed
nails
senter
teeth
and
nails
are
just
like
other
women
only
better
book
villainesses
hair
is
either
red
or
hers
is
pale
gold
though
her
eyes
are
brown
and
very
soft
when
they
turn
toward
sir
lionel
nevertheless
though
i
cattish
except
when
absolutely
necessary
i
know
she
a
never
happy
unless
she
has
the
centre
of
the
stage
whether
it
part
or
not
wanting
everyone
to
feel
the
curtain
rises
when
she
comes
on
and
falls
when
she
goes
off
she
looks
so
i
suppose
but
really
she
most
graceful
standing
up
for
sir
lionel
to
take
off
her
cloak
her
trailing
gray
satin
dress
twisted
about
her
feet
as
some
charming
slender
trees
stand
with
their
bark
spreading
out
round
them
on
the
ground
and
folding
in
lovely
lines
like
drapery
she
managed
to
draw
norton
into
conversation
with
her
and
sir
lionel
and
to
let
dick
talk
to
me
so
they
must
have
arranged
beforehand
what
they
would
do
at
first
when
he
had
got
his
wish
and
been
introduced
he
spoke
of
ordinary
things
but
presently
he
asked
if
i
remembered
his
saying
that
he
wished
to
go
into
a
certain
profession
i
answered
yes
before
i
stopped
to
think
which
i
afraid
flattered
him
and
then
he
wanted
me
to
guess
what
the
profession
was
when
i
would
he
said
it
was
that
of
a
detective
if
i
succeed
my
mother
will
give
up
her
objections
he
explained
and
i
think
i
shall
succeed
it
was
when
he
said
this
that
he
looked
so
wicked
or
else
as
if
he
wanted
to
sneeze
as
i
told
you
what
can
he
mean
and
what
has
he
found
out
or
is
it
only
my
bad
conscience
oh
dear
i
should
like
to
give
it
a
thorough
spring
cleaning
as
one
does
in
lent
i
afraid
that
what
is
needed
i
had
plenty
of
blacks
on
it
since
ellaline
made
me
consent
to
her
plan
and
i
began
to
carry
it
out
but
now
i
have
more
i
have
lots
of
dresses
and
hats
on
it
too
lovely
ones
and
petticoats
and
such
things
etc
did
dragons
of
old
insist
on
their
fairy
having
exquisite
clothes
and
say
hang
the
expense
dragon
has
done
so
with
his
princess
and
i
had
to
take
the
things
because
you
see
i
have
engaged
to
play
the
part
and
this
apparently
is
his
rich
conception
of
it
he
says
that
i
ellaline
can
afford
to
have
everything
that
nice
so
what
i
do
the
worst
of
it
is
much
of
my
new
finery
is
so
delicate
it
will
be
by
the
time
the
real
ellaline
can
have
it
even
if
it
would
fit
or
suit
her
which
it
wo
but
probably
the
man
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
a
ward
in
gray
serge
and
a
sailor
hat
so
i
could
very
well
violate
his
feelings
perhaps
if
i
refused
to
do
what
he
wanted
all
his
hidden
would
have
rushed
to
the
surface
but
as
i
was
quite
meek
he
behaved
more
like
an
angel
than
a
dragon
it
really
was
fun
buying
the
things
in
a
fascinating
shop
where
the
assistants
were
all
more
refined
than
duchesses
and
so
they
seemed
to
be
held
together
only
by
their
spines
and
a
ladylike
ligament
or
two
but
if
providence
did
wish
women
to
lace
why
were
our
ribs
made
to
go
all
the
way
down
the
way
we
were
created
it
an
to
pinch
waists
it
seems
does
it
i
was
a
dream
to
look
at
when
we
went
to
supper
at
that
restaurant
which
was
comfort
senter
things
were
no
nicer
than
mine
and
she
was
so
interested
in
what
i
wore
only
she
was
a
good
deal
more
interested
in
sir
lionel
everywhere
i
go
people
are
talking
of
you
she
said
you
have
given
them
exciting
things
to
talk
about
really
i
was
aware
of
it
returned
the
poor
dragon
as
apologetically
as
if
she
waked
him
up
to
say
he
been
snoring
since
i
wrote
you
i
heard
more
things
about
his
past
from
norton
who
is
as
proud
of
her
brother
after
a
fashion
as
a
cat
of
its
mouse
and
always
wanting
to
show
him
off
in
just
the
same
way
we
all
have
our
mouse
have
we
i
yours
just
now
the
new
hats
are
mine
she
has
told
me
a
splendid
story
about
a
thing
he
did
in
bengal
saved
twelve
people
lives
in
a
house
that
was
on
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
kind
of
house
which
blazes
like
a
haystack
and
according
to
her
he
thinks
no
more
of
rescuing
drowning
persons
who
jump
off
ships
in
seas
swarming
with
sharks
than
we
think
of
fishing
a
fly
out
of
our
bath
now
it
possible
for
a
man
like
that
to
be
treacherous
to
women
and
to
accept
bribes
for
being
guardian
to
their
children
i
do
wish
i
knew
what
to
make
of
it
all
and
of
him
he
has
taken
the
funny
little
bengalese
valet
who
has
been
and
is
to
be
his
chauffeur
to
try
the
new
car
this
morning
he
meant
to
have
gone
before
this
to
look
at
his
partly
burnt
castle
in
warwickshire
but
he
says
london
has
captivated
him
and
he
ca
tear
himself
away
that
he
will
go
in
a
day
or
two
when
he
has
trotted
norton
and
me
about
to
see
a
few
more
sights
of
course
we
could
quite
well
see
the
sights
by
ourselves
norton
has
seen
them
all
anyhow
and
only
revisits
them
for
my
sake
while
as
for
me
you
and
i
did
london
thrillingly
together
in
the
last
two
months
of
our
glory
but
sir
lionel
has
an
interesting
way
of
telling
things
and
he
is
as
enthusiastic
as
a
boy
over
his
england
not
that
he
gushes
but
one
knows
somehow
what
he
is
feeling
i
ca
imagine
his
ever
being
tired
but
he
is
very
considerate
of
us
seems
to
think
women
are
frail
as
glass
i
suppose
women
a
sex
by
themselves
but
we
are
as
different
as
all
that
once
in
a
while
he
threw
a
sideways
glare
at
dick
burden
when
was
talking
with
a
confidential
air
to
me
i
know
from
ellaline
and
norton
that
sir
lionel
dislikes
women
but
all
the
same
i
believe
he
thinks
we
ought
to
be
kept
indoors
unless
veiled
and
never
allowed
to
talk
to
men
except
our
relatives
norton
is
funny
without
knowing
it
she
asked
her
brother
as
gravely
as
possible
at
breakfast
this
morning
had
you
a
harem
in
bengal
dear
good
heavens
no
he
answered
turning
red
what
put
such
a
ghastly
idea
into
your
head
oh
i
only
thought
perhaps
it
was
the
thing
and
you
were
obliged
to
or
be
talked
about
she
explained
calmly
he
went
on
to
tell
her
that
it
was
not
at
all
necessary
to
have
harems
and
she
was
quite
surprised
you
would
think
that
she
have
taken
pains
to
find
out
every
detail
of
her
brother
life
in
a
country
where
he
was
one
of
the
head
men
would
you
but
she
hardly
feels
that
any
country
except
her
own
is
worth
serious
inquiries
she
has
the
impression
that
heathen
are
all
alike
and
mostly
naked
but
not
as
embarrassing
to
meet
as
if
they
were
white
dearest
i
afraid
i
write
very
disconnected
letters
but
i
feel
disconnected
myself
somehow
like
a
telephone
that
been
cut
off
your
loving
and
deceiver
it
for
i
forgot
to
post
this
there
were
so
many
things
doing
please
forgive
me
the
car
splendid
and
i
am
to
christen
her
we
going
to
have
a
kind
of
ceremony
like
a
launching
and
i
have
to
think
of
a
name
for
her
and
throw
wine
on
her
bonnet
sir
lionel
is
longing
to
get
off
on
the
tour
he
says
and
as
he
to
leave
town
for
warwickshire
turning
me
over
temporarily
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
good
his
sister
i
almost
hope
that
after
all
senter
may
have
time
to
sweedle
him
into
taking
her
with
us
as
i
she
hopes
to
do
we
by
the
way
are
not
to
see
his
place
until
the
burnt
bit
is
mended
we
to
avoid
warwickshire
in
starting
out
go
away
up
north
as
far
as
the
roman
wall
visit
bamborough
castle
where
he
thinks
friends
of
his
who
own
it
will
actually
invite
us
to
lunch
or
something
it
seems
like
a
dream
and
then
stop
in
warwickshire
at
the
end
of
the
tour
when
all
the
dilapidations
have
been
made
good
the
dragon
naturally
expects
me
not
only
to
finish
the
trip
but
to
take
up
my
residence
at
graylees
until
next
spring
when
his
plan
is
that
his
ward
shall
be
presented
oh
mice
and
men
and
dragons
how
aft
your
plans
gang
agley
of
course
mine
depend
altogether
upon
ellaline
i
hold
myself
ready
for
marching
orders
from
her
but
i
must
confess
to
you
that
whether
right
or
wrong
i
do
look
forward
to
the
weeks
of
my
duties
as
understudy
with
the
same
feelings
i
had
when
i
was
engaged
to
perform
them
little
did
sir
lionel
guess
what
was
in
my
mind
this
morning
when
i
asked
if
one
could
see
most
of
england
in
a
few
weeks
when
motoring
but
i
may
have
to
take
my
flight
from
the
car
so
to
speak
unless
ellaline
be
detained
for
some
reason
i
expecting
a
letter
from
her
any
day
now
and
there
may
be
definite
news
again
dearest
viii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
hotel
brightest
and
best
donna
é
am
la
donna
and
the
most
inward
of
my
me
some
people
norton
for
instance
might
say
what
on
earth
does
the
silly
thing
mean
but
you
always
know
what
i
mean
you
and
i
were
born
knowing
quite
a
lot
of
nice
little
things
like
that
were
we
things
we
picked
up
during
our
various
incarnations
things
souls
have
had
time
to
collect
poor
dears
my
automobiliness
is
the
reason
i
only
sent
you
snippy
and
notes
interspersed
with
telegrams
for
the
last
few
days
just
thanking
you
for
wise
advice
and
saying
you
will
guess
from
my
very
handwriting
that
i
feeling
more
at
home
in
life
than
i
did
when
i
wrote
you
last
and
i
ca
help
being
pleased
that
ellaline
adored
one
wo
be
able
to
leave
his
manoeuvres
to
make
her
his
own
till
a
fortnight
or
so
later
than
she
expected
that
is
i
ca
help
being
glad
as
the
doctor
thinks
you
ought
to
stop
at
till
after
the
first
week
of
september
and
we
be
together
even
if
i
were
back
in
paris
you
swear
you
did
hypnotize
him
to
say
that
i
would
enjoy
more
peace
of
mind
while
careering
through
england
in
apollo
if
i
were
certain
oh
that
reminds
me
i
forgot
to
tell
you
what
fun
it
was
christening
apollo
i
quite
enjoyed
it
and
felt
immensely
important
do
you
think
apollo
an
appropriate
name
for
such
a
magnificent
car
as
described
to
you
the
sun
god
driver
of
the
chariot
of
the
sun
sir
lionel
likes
it
but
he
says
he
is
sure
the
cloud
would
be
a
more
appropriate
name
because
the
car
costs
such
a
lot
that
she
has
a
silver
lining
i
began
by
calling
her
it
but
he
wo
let
me
do
that
he
does
much
mind
my
being
amateurish
but
he
hates
me
to
be
disrespectful
i
am
so
dazzled
by
the
motor
and
enchanted
with
the
sport
of
motoring
as
well
as
seeing
things
even
more
lovely
than
i
hoped
for
that
i
not
worrying
over
dick
burden
and
his
mysterious
hints
about
himself
as
a
detective
besides
when
he
and
his
aunt
came
to
tea
you
remember
i
told
you
in
a
scrap
of
a
note
that
it
was
the
day
sir
lionel
went
to
warwickshire
and
how
vexed
senter
was
to
find
him
gone
dick
made
himself
quite
pleasant
he
was
impertinent
or
too
admiring
or
anything
which
a
young
englishman
ought
not
to
be
indeed
i
thought
by
his
manner
that
he
wanted
tacitly
to
apologize
for
his
bad
behaviour
when
we
first
met
so
probably
when
i
fancied
he
looked
wicked
that
night
at
ennis
rooms
it
because
he
wanted
to
sneeze
you
have
taught
me
to
give
everybody
except
young
men
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
i
do
see
why
one
should
give
it
to
young
men
too
i
think
they
rather
easier
to
forgive
somehow
than
women
is
that
why
they
dangerous
but
could
never
be
dangerous
to
me
in
the
sense
of
falling
in
love
his
aunt
certainly
wishes
to
throw
us
together
i
suppose
on
account
of
ellaline
money
she
does
like
girls
i
sure
but
would
always
be
ready
on
principle
to
give
first
aid
to
heiresses
it
is
something
to
be
thankful
for
that
she
has
grafted
herself
on
to
our
party
as
i
feared
she
might
and
though
they
both
going
to
stop
at
some
country
house
near
southsea
and
they
hope
we
may
meet
i
dare
say
i
sha
be
bothered
by
them
again
while
i
in
england
i
do
intend
to
worry
donna
é
automobile
i
have
properly
described
our
start
or
told
you
about
the
things
i
seen
and
i
promised
to
tell
you
everything
so
i
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
trip
there
was
apollo
throbbing
with
joy
of
life
in
front
of
the
hotel
door
at
nine
of
a
perfect
english
morning
there
were
statuesque
ritzy
footmen
gazing
admiringly
at
the
big
car
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
thought
she
should
be
named
after
the
sun
god
she
is
so
golden
there
was
charu
chunder
bose
alias
young
nick
who
would
think
it
a
sin
against
all
his
gods
to
dress
as
a
chauffeur
and
who
continues
to
garb
himself
as
a
bengali
young
nick
with
his
sleepy
eyes
and
his
smile
about
as
appropriate
on
a
as
a
baby
crocodile
there
was
sir
lionel
waiting
to
tuck
us
in
there
were
we
two
females
in
neat
gray
motor
on
which
the
dragon
insisted
norton
in
a
toque
which
she
wore
as
if
it
were
a
remote
and
dreaded
contingency
your
audrie
in
a
duck
of
an
early
victorian
bonnet
in
which
she
liked
herself
better
than
in
anything
else
she
ever
had
on
before
there
too
was
our
luggage
made
to
fit
the
car
and
looking
like
the
very
last
word
of
if
you
know
what
that
look
is
of
course
it
was
the
first
time
i
been
out
in
the
car
for
i
think
i
told
you
the
day
apollo
was
christened
i
had
a
spin
but
it
rained
and
we
went
only
through
the
park
that
was
nothing
this
morning
we
were
bidding
to
london
and
our
pulses
were
beating
high
for
the
tour
young
nick
drove
on
the
christening
day
but
this
time
sir
lionel
took
the
driver
seat
with
the
brown
idol
beside
him
and
i
saw
instantly
by
the
very
way
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
with
a
kind
of
caress
as
a
pats
a
beloved
mare
neck
that
he
and
the
golden
car
were
in
perfect
sympathy
we
were
starting
early
because
sir
lionel
had
planned
a
good
many
things
for
us
to
see
before
dark
but
early
as
it
was
piccadilly
and
knightsbridge
were
seething
with
traffic
like
mad
hippopotamuses
like
fierce
young
lions
huge
carts
like
elephants
and
other
vehicles
of
all
sorts
to
make
up
a
confused
medley
of
wild
animals
escaped
from
the
zoo
it
looked
appalling
to
mingle
with
but
our
own
private
dragon
drove
so
skilfully
yet
so
carefully
that
i
never
bit
my
heart
once
always
the
car
seemed
sentient
steering
its
way
like
a
long
thin
pike
then
when
the
chance
came
flashing
ahead
dauntless
and
sure
we
went
by
a
great
domed
palace
harrod
stores
and
then
over
putney
bridge
passing
swinburne
house
whose
outside
is
as
deceiving
as
an
that
hides
a
pearl
through
epsom
charles
the
brighton
which
i
been
reading
about
in
a
volume
of
pepys
sir
lionel
has
given
me
to
leatherhead
along
the
dorking
road
slowing
up
for
a
glimpse
of
juniper
hall
glowing
red
as
a
smouldering
bonfire
behind
a
dark
latticed
screen
of
splendid
lebanon
cedars
i
dare
say
it
a
good
deal
changed
since
dear
little
fanny
burney
day
for
the
house
looks
quite
modern
but
then
neither
buildings
nor
the
people
who
live
in
them
show
their
age
early
in
england
close
under
box
hill
we
glided
and
sir
lionel
pointed
out
a
little
path
leading
up
on
the
left
to
george
meredith
cottage
just
a
small
house
of
gray
stone
it
is
for
i
would
get
out
and
walk
up
part
way
to
see
it
from
far
off
not
to
intrude
or
spy
and
there
that
great
genius
shines
out
a
clear
white
light
for
the
world
like
a
beacon
or
a
star
evidently
surrey
air
suits
geniuses
do
you
remember
reading
about
keats
that
he
wrote
a
lot
of
endymion
at
burford
bridge
it
was
only
a
little
after
ten
when
we
passed
the
hotel
there
but
already
at
least
a
dozen
motors
were
drawn
up
before
it
i
wanted
to
go
in
and
ask
if
they
show
the
room
lord
nelson
used
but
we
had
too
many
things
to
see
of
course
i
am
always
wishing
for
you
but
i
began
to
wish
the
hardest
just
as
we
came
into
this
green
brackeny
fairyland
of
surrey
it
the
kind
of
country
you
love
best
although
i
must
say
it
was
never
planned
for
motors
winding
through
those
green
tunnels
which
are
the
surrey
lanes
i
felt
as
if
in
some
quaint
dream
i
were
motoring
on
a
expecting
another
car
to
want
to
pass
me
on
the
same
rope
which
naturally
it
could
it
would
have
been
much
worse
though
if
young
nick
had
been
driving
that
little
smooth
brown
face
of
his
looks
as
if
its
hid
no
human
emotions
and
i
believe
if
people
and
animals
were
perfectly
flat
like
paper
dolls
so
that
they
would
do
no
harm
to
his
car
he
mind
how
many
he
drove
over
luckily
however
they
flat
and
the
only
thing
earthly
he
adores
after
his
master
is
his
motor
so
he
is
nice
and
cautious
for
its
sake
but
the
dragon
thinks
of
everyone
and
says
there
no
pleasure
for
him
in
motoring
if
he
leaves
a
trail
of
distress
or
even
annoyance
along
the
road
as
he
passes
he
slows
down
at
corners
he
goes
carefully
round
them
he
almost
walks
apollo
in
places
where
creatures
of
any
kind
may
start
out
unexpectedly
and
he
blows
our
pleasant
musical
horn
as
if
by
instinct
never
forgetting
as
i
sure
i
should
do
as
we
twisted
and
turned
through
the
surrey
lanes
between
dorking
and
shere
little
children
in
red
cloaks
and
tams
appeared
from
behind
hedges
looking
like
blowing
poppies
as
they
ran
and
haired
girls
in
cottage
doorways
under
hanging
bowers
of
roses
were
as
decorative
as
old
chelsea
china
girls
the
red
tiles
of
their
roofs
as
i
turned
back
for
one
more
glimpse
would
already
be
half
hidden
in
waves
of
green
but
would
just
show
up
like
beds
of
scarlet
geraniums
buried
in
leaves
shere
was
almost
too
beautiful
to
be
real
with
its
rows
of
elizabethan
cottages
whose
windows
twinkled
at
us
with
their
panes
sparkling
under
their
low
from
between
black
oak
beams
the
tudor
chimneys
were
as
graceful
as
the
smoke
wreaths
that
lazily
spiraled
above
them
and
the
whole
effect
was
was
well
inexpressibly
birket
foster
i
used
to
think
he
idealized
but
then
i
never
seen
anything
of
england
but
london
and
did
know
how
all
english
trees
cottages
and
even
clouds
are
trained
to
group
themselves
to
suit
artists
of
different
schools
i
kept
wishing
that
you
made
me
study
architecture
and
botany
instead
of
languages
and
music
in
justice
to
oneself
one
ought
when
travelling
in
england
to
have
at
least
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
every
sort
of
architecture
and
all
families
of
flowers
to
say
nothing
of
trees
so
that
one
might
exclaim
as
snobs
do
of
royalties
and
celebrities
oh
was
the
great
granddaughter
of
he
married
lady
also
i
find
i
need
much
more
knowledge
of
literature
than
i
have
this
country
is
divided
off
into
a
kind
of
glorious
chessboard
each
square
being
sacred
to
some
immortal
author
playwright
or
poet
the
artists
press
them
close
without
overcrowding
and
history
lies
underneath
history
for
every
square
inch
twelve
coffin
deep
i
quoted
kipling
to
myself
as
my
mind
panted
along
roman
roads
and
the
pilgrim
way
why
was
there
a
cemetery
there
asked
norton
looking
mildly
interested
she
by
the
way
does
much
care
for
ruins
she
says
they
so
untidy
you
and
i
travelled
till
our
money
threatened
to
give
out
in
the
noble
cause
of
but
i
never
realized
history
quite
so
potently
even
in
italy
as
i
do
in
england
yet
that
not
strange
when
you
think
how
tiny
england
is
compared
with
other
countries
and
how
things
have
gone
on
happening
there
every
minute
since
the
phoenicians
found
it
a
snug
little
island
its
chapters
of
history
have
to
be
packed
like
sardines
beginning
down
down
far
deeper
than
kipling
twelve
coffins
one
surrey
village
telleth
another
just
to
slip
through
in
a
though
none
could
ever
be
tiresome
in
the
telling
but
if
one
stopped
to
hear
the
real
story
of
each
one
how
different
they
would
all
be
there
would
be
grand
chapters
of
fighting
and
mysterious
chapters
of
smuggling
oh
but
long
ones
about
smuggling
since
most
of
the
manors
and
half
the
old
cottages
have
smugglers
rooms
where
the
lace
and
spirits
used
to
be
hidden
in
their
secret
journey
from
portsmouth
to
london
it
difficult
to
believe
in
these
thrilling
chapters
now
in
the
rich
placid
county
where
the
only
mystery
floats
in
the
veil
of
blue
mist
that
twists
like
a
gauze
scarf
around
the
tree
trunks
in
the
woods
and
the
only
black
spots
are
the
dark
downs
in
the
distance
with
the
sky
pale
gold
behind
them
you
would
love
motoring
not
only
for
what
you
do
see
but
for
what
you
nearly
see
and
long
to
see
but
ca
just
as
dad
used
to
say
thank
god
for
all
the
blessings
i
never
had
why
every
road
you
do
go
down
looks
fantastically
alluring
just
twice
as
alluring
as
the
one
you
are
in
you
grudge
missing
anything
and
fear
greedily
that
there
may
be
better
villages
with
more
history
beyond
the
line
of
your
route
no
consolation
when
norton
says
well
you
ca
see
everything
you
to
see
everything
and
you
wish
you
had
eyes
all
the
way
round
your
head
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
hair
and
hats
but
you
could
manage
somehow
we
had
to
go
through
petworth
a
most
old
place
reeking
of
history
since
the
confessor
and
mentioned
in
the
domesday
book
i
do
so
respect
towns
or
houses
mentioned
in
the
domesday
book
and
if
it
had
been
the
right
day
we
could
have
seen
lord
leconsfield
collection
of
pictures
some
of
the
best
in
england
but
it
was
the
wrong
day
so
we
sailed
on
out
of
surrey
into
sussex
and
arrived
at
bignor
all
i
knew
about
bignor
was
that
i
must
expect
something
amazing
there
sir
lionel
asked
me
not
to
read
about
it
in
the
books
of
which
we
have
a
travelling
library
in
the
car
one
at
least
for
each
county
we
shall
visit
he
said
he
wanted
bignor
to
be
a
surprise
for
me
and
it
is
odd
the
way
one
finds
oneself
obeying
that
man
not
that
one
afraid
of
him
but
well
i
do
know
why
exactly
but
one
just
does
it
we
did
stop
in
the
village
though
there
was
the
quaintest
grocery
shop
there
you
can
imagine
perfectly
mediæval
and
in
the
churchyard
yew
trees
grand
enough
to
make
bows
for
half
the
archers
of
england
if
there
were
any
in
these
days
we
went
on
to
quite
a
farmhouse
and
sir
lionel
said
i
am
going
to
ask
tupper
if
she
will
give
us
a
little
lunch
if
she
says
it
sure
to
be
good
i
do
know
any
tuppers
lionel
objected
norton
who
are
they
relatives
of
martin
tupper
if
that
name
recalls
anything
to
your
mind
said
he
norton
had
a
vague
idea
that
she
had
been
more
or
less
brought
up
on
extracts
from
martin
tupper
and
seemed
to
associate
him
with
sundays
when
as
a
child
she
had
been
allowed
to
play
but
that
did
explain
how
lionel
happened
to
know
connections
of
his
in
a
sussex
farmhouse
besides
he
could
possibly
have
seen
them
for
more
than
fifteen
years
that
is
true
and
i
only
saw
them
once
even
then
he
admitted
but
tupper
had
been
here
for
a
good
many
years
engaged
in
the
most
delightful
work
which
you
will
hear
about
by
and
by
and
i
sure
she
is
here
still
and
will
be
for
many
more
years
to
come
because
i
want
to
imagine
the
place
without
her
norton
said
no
more
and
her
brother
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
which
stood
hospitably
open
in
a
minute
a
dear
old
lady
appeared
and
instantly
her
face
lighted
up
why
if
it
is
pendragon
i
mean
sir
lionel
come
back
to
see
us
again
said
she
sir
lionel
grew
red
with
pleasure
at
being
remembered
by
her
for
apparently
he
had
at
all
expected
it
he
seems
to
forget
that
he
is
a
celebrity
and
generally
does
like
being
reminded
of
the
fact
but
he
was
pleased
that
tupper
had
read
about
him
in
the
papers
from
time
to
time
and
had
never
forgotten
his
face
she
said
she
would
be
delighted
to
provide
us
with
lunch
if
we
mind
a
simple
one
and
then
she
would
have
gone
on
to
say
something
which
would
have
given
the
surprise
away
if
sir
lionel
had
stopped
her
we
had
delicious
country
things
to
eat
with
real
surrey
cream
and
apple
dumplings
they
did
taste
good
after
the
elaborate
french
cooking
in
london
by
way
of
contrast
then
when
we
had
finished
sir
lionel
said
now
tupper
can
you
take
us
for
a
stroll
round
the
farm
that
did
sound
exciting
did
it
we
walked
out
and
it
seemed
a
very
nice
farm
but
nothing
remarkable
as
we
wandered
toward
some
sheds
in
a
field
of
mangolds
sir
lionel
made
us
look
up
at
a
big
hill
and
said
there
was
a
roman
camp
there
if
you
stood
where
you
stand
now
on
a
quiet
night
in
those
times
you
could
have
heard
the
clanking
of
armour
or
the
soldiers
quarrelling
over
their
dice
here
roman
stane
street
ran
and
chariots
used
to
stop
to
bring
the
latest
news
from
rome
to
the
owner
of
the
villa
was
there
a
villa
asked
norton
who
thinks
it
polite
to
ask
her
brother
questions
whether
she
is
interested
or
not
let
take
a
look
into
this
shed
said
he
by
way
of
answer
and
there
protected
by
that
rough
roof
was
a
great
stretch
of
splendid
mosaic
pavement
it
was
done
in
circular
compartments
of
ornamentation
and
in
one
was
a
beautiful
head
of
ganymede
in
another
winter
alas
i
should
have
known
what
they
were
if
i
had
been
told
but
i
would
have
known
that
they
were
rare
and
wonderful
this
was
the
surprise
this
was
the
secret
of
bignor
but
it
nearly
all
there
were
lovely
broken
pillars
and
lots
more
pavements
acres
of
mosaic
it
seemed
for
the
villa
had
been
large
and
important
and
must
have
been
built
by
a
rich
man
with
cultivated
taste
he
knew
how
to
make
exile
endurable
did
that
roman
gentleman
standing
in
his
i
could
imagine
him
and
his
fair
sitting
at
breakfast
looking
out
from
between
white
glittering
pillars
at
the
sussex
downs
grander
than
those
of
surrey
reminding
me
of
great
brave
shoulders
raised
to
protect
england
now
we
knew
what
delightful
work
was
for
years
she
has
cleaned
the
mosaic
pavement
of
the
vanished
roman
villa
all
of
which
were
discovered
by
the
grandfather
of
the
present
owner
of
the
farm
never
once
has
she
tired
of
looking
at
the
mosaics
because
as
she
explained
to
us
one
does
tire
of
what
is
beautiful
there
speaks
true
appreciation
does
it
only
a
born
lover
of
the
beautiful
could
have
said
that
so
simply
there
was
an
italian
a
man
from
venice
repairing
the
mosaic
he
could
hardly
speak
a
word
of
english
and
beamed
with
a
sudden
smile
when
i
asked
him
some
question
in
his
native
tongue
we
talked
awhile
and
i
translated
several
things
he
said
to
sir
lionel
and
his
sister
ashamed
to
confess
dear
that
i
was
pleased
to
show
off
my
poor
little
accomplishment
and
proud
because
i
knew
one
thing
which
our
famous
man
did
was
that
low
of
me
well
you
were
disappointed
in
my
surprise
i
think
said
sir
lionel
when
we
were
starting
away
at
last
i
just
gave
him
one
look
it
really
was
necessary
to
answer
as
we
flashed
on
through
country
always
exquisite
and
over
perfect
roads
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
bignor
until
suddenly
after
passing
through
a
long
aisle
of
great
beeches
like
an
avenue
in
a
private
park
a
tremendous
bulk
of
stone
looming
at
me
made
me
jump
and
cry
out
oh
sir
lionel
turned
his
head
long
enough
for
half
a
smile
arundel
castle
he
said
it
lucky
for
me
that
norton
does
know
much
about
any
part
of
england
except
her
own
home
and
the
homes
of
her
particular
friends
or
else
she
would
always
be
explaining
things
to
me
and
i
should
hate
that
it
would
be
like
having
purple
grapes
handed
out
to
one
impaled
on
the
prongs
of
a
plated
silver
fork
i
should
have
wanted
to
slap
her
if
had
told
me
i
was
looking
at
arundel
castle
but
i
was
grateful
to
her
brother
for
the
information
this
was
a
wickedness
in
me
but
if
you
knew
how
i
felt
having
started
out
from
the
ritz
expecting
a
quiet
day
run
through
one
or
two
of
the
garden
counties
of
england
to
come
like
this
bang
into
the
midst
of
roman
villas
and
under
the
shadow
of
a
maybe
you
excuse
my
morals
for
being
upset
you
ca
have
centuries
roll
away
like
a
mere
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
your
motor
and
be
perfectly
normal
can
you
i
tried
to
seem
calm
because
i
hate
to
be
gushing
and
for
ellaline
sake
i
as
it
ca
make
any
difference
what
her
dragon
thinks
of
me
but
i
pretty
sure
he
saw
that
i
was
rather
out
of
myself
over
all
his
surprises
he
stopped
the
motor
and
we
sat
for
a
long
time
gazing
up
at
the
towers
beyond
the
green
and
silver
beeches
a
pile
of
battlemented
stone
looking
like
the
middle
ages
carved
in
granite
yet
more
habitable
than
ever
before
we
had
lunched
early
and
had
plenty
of
time
so
we
walked
through
the
park
which
made
me
feel
that
england
must
be
rather
big
after
all
to
have
room
for
thousands
of
such
parks
even
much
larger
ones
and
all
its
great
cities
and
miles
and
miles
of
farms
and
common
land
and
mere
country
when
we
lived
in
new
york
you
and
dad
and
i
we
used
to
joke
about
the
way
we
should
feel
in
england
if
we
should
ever
go
to
visit
ancestral
devonshire
we
used
to
pretend
that
after
being
accustomed
to
the
vast
distances
of
america
we
should
be
afraid
of
tumbling
off
the
edge
of
england
but
so
far
i
find
that
i
do
dread
that
imminent
peril
just
now
england
seems
so
vast
that
my
only
fear
is
i
may
have
time
to
reach
the
roman
wall
the
duke
midges
bit
us
a
good
deal
in
the
park
so
we
did
linger
but
went
back
to
apollo
where
young
nick
remarkable
appearance
had
attracted
a
crowd
of
boys
and
girls
from
arundel
town
they
stood
in
the
road
gaping
at
him
with
that
steady
unblinking
stare
english
children
and
french
have
while
the
brown
image
sat
motionless
in
the
car
as
scornfully
oblivious
of
his
critics
as
if
he
been
the
idol
he
looked
poor
sir
lionel
hates
the
attention
his
extraordinary
little
chauffeur
excites
for
in
spite
of
his
long
expatriation
he
loathes
being
conspicuous
in
any
way
as
heartily
as
other
englishmen
do
but
norton
has
told
me
he
saved
young
nick
from
being
murdered
by
someone
who
was
a
family
enemy
since
then
it
was
when
nick
was
scarcely
more
than
a
child
the
brown
image
has
worshipped
the
dragon
and
refused
to
be
separated
from
him
when
sir
lionel
proposed
providing
for
him
well
and
leaving
him
behind
nick
made
no
complaints
but
began
industriously
to
starve
himself
to
death
so
of
course
he
had
to
be
brought
to
england
and
his
master
just
makes
the
best
of
him
costume
features
broomstick
legs
and
all
we
had
tea
in
a
picture
of
turner
for
littlehampton
with
its
tidal
river
its
harbour
and
pier
its
fishing
boats
and
shining
sails
its
windmill
its
sands
and
its
banked
violet
clouds
was
a
genuine
turner
of
course
he
would
have
painted
the
beach
hotel
in
spite
of
its
nice
balconies
but
we
were
glad
it
was
there
and
it
did
spoil
the
picture
by
that
time
it
was
nearly
five
but
we
had
hours
of
daylight
before
us
so
we
stopped
for
a
look
at
climping
church
do
you
love
the
ing
that
shows
a
place
has
kept
its
saxon
name
with
its
splendid
norman
doorway
and
queer
long
windows
shaped
like
open
pods
of
peas
beautifully
ornamented
round
their
edges
thank
goodness
there
was
nothing
perp
about
it
i
get
so
tired
of
perp
things
in
guide
books
slinden
we
glanced
at
too
a
most
idyllic
village
garrisoned
with
the
noblest
beeches
i
ever
saw
hilaire
belloc
whose
path
to
rome
we
liked
so
much
stayed
at
slinden
writing
delightful
things
about
sussex
i
mean
to
get
and
read
all
i
can
because
even
in
the
glimpse
i
had
i
can
see
that
sussex
has
a
character
as
well
as
a
charm
individually
its
own
the
downs
give
it
and
make
you
feel
that
a
true
man
of
sussex
would
be
frank
simple
and
brave
with
ways
which
with
a
pleasant
obstinacy
he
would
be
loath
to
change
i
heard
tupper
quote
two
or
three
quaint
proverbs
which
were
new
to
me
but
sir
lionel
said
they
were
old
almost
as
the
sussex
downs
and
as
racy
of
the
soil
i
always
associated
brighton
with
sussex
which
made
it
seem
a
sophisticated
county
but
you
see
sussex
the
downs
stands
all
independent
and
sturdy
between
the
by
the
sea
and
the
snug
weald
the
faces
we
passed
did
look
like
faces
descended
from
smugglers
they
seemed
so
kind
and
good
but
then
of
course
smuggling
was
quite
a
respectable
industry
in
sussex
where
the
secretive
formation
of
the
coast
clearly
showed
that
providence
had
meant
it
to
epict
i
love
the
sussex
downs
i
like
the
sussex
faces
and
i
admire
the
sussex
church
spires
tall
and
pointed
covered
with
lichened
shingles
we
stopped
at
boxgrove
too
a
church
adored
by
architects
and
as
we
went
our
way
to
goodwood
the
sea
was
a
torn
sheet
of
silver
seen
behind
great
downs
which
the
afternoon
sun
was
gilding
oh
the
lebanon
cedars
and
the
views
of
goodwood
if
i
were
there
for
the
races
i
think
not
even
the
finest
horses
the
most
beautiful
women
and
the
prettiest
frocks
in
england
could
hold
my
eyes
long
from
that
view
i
can
shut
my
eyes
now
the
day
after
and
see
those
lebanon
cedars
black
against
an
opal
sky
another
picture
i
can
see
too
is
bosham
church
standing
up
tall
and
pure
as
a
gray
nun
singing
an
beside
the
clear
water
it
comes
back
to
me
from
my
studies
of
english
history
that
vespasian
had
a
villa
there
and
that
harold
sailed
from
bosham
do
you
know
he
in
the
act
of
doing
it
on
the
bayeux
tapestry
once
the
danes
stole
the
bosham
church
bells
and
the
dear
things
still
ring
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
because
the
robber
ship
was
wrecked
and
went
down
with
the
chime
in
mid
channel
i
like
that
story
it
matches
the
picture
and
the
tapestry
our
day
stopped
at
chichester
and
my
letter
must
stop
too
for
all
this
i
tell
you
of
was
only
yesterday
we
arrived
last
evening
and
now
it
nearly
midnight
of
the
next
day
i
began
to
write
just
after
dinner
sitting
in
my
dear
room
and
if
i
do
soon
say
i
sha
get
much
beauty
sleep
morning
at
nine
we
going
on
but
before
we
start
i
scribble
a
chichester
postscript
so
you
see
i
must
be
up
bright
and
early
especially
as
i
mean
to
fly
out
for
one
more
glimpse
of
the
cathedral
though
i
spent
most
of
this
afternoon
in
it
i
wonder
if
you
are
sparing
a
few
minutes
to
dream
of
your
audrie
in
the
morning
and
i
been
up
for
two
hours
you
like
chichester
immensely
i
do
say
love
for
it
engaged
my
affections
somehow
but
i
do
love
the
beautiful
jewel
of
a
market
cross
and
some
of
the
tombs
in
the
cathedral
the
cross
is
quite
a
baby
compared
with
lots
of
others
it
seems
being
only
just
born
at
the
time
henry
viii
was
cutting
off
pretty
ladies
heads
when
he
had
tired
of
their
hearts
several
tombs
are
so
lovely
you
almost
want
to
be
dead
and
have
one
as
like
as
possible
but
though
part
of
the
cathedral
is
satisfyingly
old
eleventh
century
its
new
spire
reminds
one
of
a
badly
chosen
hat
and
the
whole
building
somehow
looks
cold
and
dull
like
a
person
with
a
magnificent
profile
who
never
says
anything
illuminating
illustration
jewel
of
a
market
as
for
chichester
itself
except
the
market
cross
the
only
thing
that
has
touched
my
heart
was
mary
hospital
surely
the
quaintest
old
almshouse
on
earth
the
town
has
rather
a
air
to
me
and
unless
one
were
wise
one
might
realize
without
being
informed
that
it
immemorably
old
of
course
though
if
one
wise
one
would
know
the
romans
had
had
a
hand
in
the
making
or
of
it
because
of
the
geometric
regular
way
in
which
it
built
sir
lionel
pendragon
told
me
that
he
seems
to
remember
all
he
ever
learned
whereas
ever
so
many
little
bundles
are
already
knocking
about
in
dusty
corners
of
my
brain
with
their
labels
lost
there
could
be
a
more
thrilling
road
than
the
road
along
which
we
came
to
chichester
and
by
which
we
will
leave
it
in
a
few
minutes
now
think
of
roman
stane
street
and
listen
for
the
rumble
of
ghostly
chariot
wheels
then
if
you
not
come
this
way
for
goodwood
races
you
can
throw
your
mind
a
little
further
ahead
to
the
days
of
the
crusaders
and
the
pilgrims
and
to
kings
processions
glittering
with
gold
and
glossy
with
velvets
to
armies
on
their
way
to
fight
and
further
ahead
to
coaches
plying
along
the
portsmouth
road
i
wonder
how
many
people
in
the
hundreds
of
motors
that
flash
back
and
forth
each
day
do
think
of
it
all
i
pity
those
who
do
because
they
lose
a
thought
that
might
embroider
their
world
with
rich
colours
i
met
sir
lionel
accidentally
of
course
in
the
cathedral
this
morning
where
he
too
was
saying
to
the
most
fascinating
of
the
old
tombs
and
was
it
odd
we
had
the
same
favourites
they
looked
even
nicer
and
queerer
than
yesterday
with
no
norton
to
spatter
inappropriate
remarks
about
we
walked
back
to
the
hotel
together
and
he
asked
me
just
as
we
were
coming
in
whether
my
allowance
was
enough
or
would
i
like
to
have
more
i
had
burst
out
that
it
was
heaps
before
i
stopped
to
realize
that
he
was
asking
that
question
really
of
ellaline
not
of
me
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
temporized
and
said
i
would
make
up
my
mind
in
a
few
days
meanwhile
writing
to
her
i
suppose
she
must
be
quite
an
heiress
but
he
ca
be
as
mercenary
as
she
thinks
or
he
would
have
made
such
a
suggestion
i
called
the
motor
ready
i
post
this
from
the
hotel
ix
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
dearest
this
address
is
part
of
our
plan
of
campaign
meant
to
pass
through
after
pausing
on
the
way
just
long
enough
to
see
portsmouth
harbour
and
dickens
birthplace
but
we
stopped
here
on
my
account
and
now
i
wish
we
had
i
tell
you
why
in
a
minute
but
if
i
do
mention
a
few
other
things
first
they
be
crowded
out
and
i
shall
forget
them
after
we
seen
the
birthplace
and
were
seeing
the
harbour
sir
lionel
asked
if
i
care
to
go
on
board
a
of
course
my
answer
was
yes
and
he
said
there
was
an
old
friend
of
his
whom
he
would
like
to
see
captain
starlin
of
the
so
he
ask
for
an
invitation
he
scribbled
things
in
pencil
on
a
and
sent
it
on
board
the
big
gray
monster
by
a
nice
sailor
of
course
the
invitation
which
came
back
was
most
cordial
and
even
norton
appeared
pleased
with
the
idea
of
going
over
the
ship
we
were
received
by
the
captain
himself
rather
a
man
whose
complexion
seemed
to
have
slipped
down
like
sir
lionel
both
their
foreheads
being
quite
white
and
the
rest
of
their
faces
tanned
brown
he
took
us
everywhere
showing
us
interesting
things
and
presently
said
that
not
only
must
we
dine
with
him
that
evening
but
must
stay
to
a
dance
that
was
to
be
given
on
board
afterward
oh
many
thanks
but
we
only
motoring
through
and
go
on
this
afternoon
began
sir
lionel
then
he
stopped
short
and
looked
at
me
would
you
like
to
dance
he
asked
she
has
anything
to
wear
if
she
would
norton
answered
for
me
you
were
so
strict
about
luggage
we
only
two
evening
dresses
apiece
plain
things
for
hotel
dinners
nothing
at
all
suitable
to
a
dance
did
you
buy
her
anything
good
enough
for
dances
that
day
in
bond
street
snapped
the
dragon
bought
her
several
things
almost
too
good
for
dances
at
her
age
retaliated
the
dragon
sister
but
only
in
a
gentle
coo
left
at
the
ritz
awaiting
instructions
to
go
on
to
graylees
with
most
of
our
things
and
will
probably
be
all
beggars
creases
before
she
has
a
chance
to
wear
them
she
shall
have
a
chance
to
wear
any
or
all
of
them
if
she
wants
to
dance
said
sir
lionel
of
course
she
wants
to
dance
chimed
in
captain
starlin
did
you
ever
see
a
young
lady
who
did
want
to
dance
especially
on
a
you
want
to
repeated
the
dragon
between
them
i
was
quite
dashed
and
murmured
something
about
its
being
very
nice
if
it
had
been
convenient
but
there
is
no
said
ellaline
guardian
that
settles
it
we
stop
the
night
in
southsea
where
there
no
doubt
a
good
hotel
and
i
will
send
someone
immediately
to
the
ritz
for
your
boxes
emily
and
yours
he
never
calls
me
by
name
if
he
can
help
it
emily
was
inclined
to
object
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
send
and
we
did
want
all
our
things
anyway
till
her
brother
gave
her
a
look
not
cross
but
well
just
one
of
his
looks
that
make
you
do
things
or
stop
doing
them
whichever
he
pleases
and
she
did
say
any
more
i
ca
help
rather
liking
his
masterful
ways
though
now
that
we
all
supposed
to
think
we
need
votes
more
than
frocks
but
this
time
it
really
would
have
been
ungrateful
of
me
to
disapprove
as
the
whole
fuss
was
being
made
for
me
and
i
was
dying
to
go
to
the
dance
we
went
quickly
back
to
the
motor
spun
into
southsea
and
before
the
female
contingent
knew
exactly
what
was
happening
to
it
rooms
were
engaged
for
the
night
and
a
responsible
person
despatched
by
the
first
train
to
town
with
a
letter
demanding
certain
articles
of
our
luggage
i
was
quite
excited
about
the
evening
but
outwardly
was
more
than
usual
calm
as
we
wandered
here
and
there
after
luncheon
seeing
southsea
which
must
by
the
way
be
a
most
convenient
place
for
girls
as
they
can
choose
between
navy
and
army
or
play
with
both
if
they
are
pretty
enough
just
as
we
were
going
to
have
a
run
out
to
hayling
island
in
the
car
whom
should
we
meet
in
the
street
close
to
our
hotel
but
senter
and
dick
burden
she
was
looking
very
fetching
and
young
almost
like
a
girl
certainly
as
unlike
an
aunt
as
possible
and
mother
i
it
was
an
accident
i
do
mean
about
her
being
an
aunt
of
course
but
being
in
southsea
and
meeting
us
the
day
she
called
in
london
when
sir
lionel
was
in
warwickshire
i
heard
her
asking
norton
questions
about
our
route
and
when
dear
emily
mentioned
winchester
she
said
oh
wo
you
be
passing
through
southsea
norton
answered
in
her
vague
little
way
that
she
was
sure
she
did
know
then
senter
went
on
to
say
that
she
and
dick
were
invited
to
stay
at
a
house
near
southsea
and
she
thought
they
would
probably
accept
perhaps
if
they
did
we
might
meet
but
as
i
wrote
you
i
thought
it
more
likely
we
would
unless
sir
lionel
should
seem
keen
when
he
heard
and
he
he
apparently
took
no
interest
whatever
when
his
sister
repeated
the
conversation
to
him
next
day
well
i
sure
senter
made
up
her
mind
to
accept
her
invitation
even
if
she
did
ask
for
one
the
minute
she
found
out
that
we
were
likely
soon
to
pass
southsea
she
must
have
known
we
would
be
sure
to
stop
for
a
look
round
portsmouth
and
the
neighbourhood
and
thought
the
chance
worth
taking
if
she
had
she
would
have
stopped
in
london
till
the
end
of
the
season
no
doubt
for
she
the
kind
of
person
who
lives
for
society
and
only
cares
for
the
country
when
the
fashion
to
be
in
it
i
would
be
a
bit
surprised
if
she
been
patrolling
the
streets
of
portsmouth
and
southsea
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
hope
of
running
across
us
sooner
or
later
or
as
dick
burden
fancies
himself
in
the
part
of
a
detective
perhaps
he
hit
upon
some
surer
way
of
getting
at
us
those
two
aunt
and
nephew
play
into
each
other
hands
beautifully
mamma
it
seems
is
visiting
in
scotland
at
the
moment
so
they
hunt
in
couples
how
long
aunt
gwen
has
been
a
widow
the
saints
may
know
i
do
but
anyway
she
has
begun
to
take
notice
as
people
say
about
bright
little
babies
she
has
looked
up
sir
lionel
in
debrett
and
marked
him
with
a
red
cross
for
her
own
i
believe
such
impudence
a
woman
like
that
to
dare
think
of
trying
to
grab
a
man
of
his
position
and
record
she
ought
to
know
how
unsuitable
she
would
be
for
him
as
for
dick
of
course
he
wants
to
flirt
with
me
but
wait
wait
till
you
hear
the
latest
developments
sir
lionel
seemed
neither
pleased
nor
displeased
at
the
meeting
but
he
could
not
have
suspected
it
was
more
than
an
accident
for
he
remarked
that
it
was
odd
we
should
run
up
against
each
other
like
this
senter
said
yes
indeed
it
was
she
was
never
more
surprised
in
her
life
though
really
it
would
have
been
odd
when
one
came
to
think
of
it
if
we
had
met
since
she
and
dick
were
stopping
with
friends
on
hayling
island
and
were
constantly
in
southsea
do
let
me
write
a
note
to
my
friend
captain
starlin
and
get
you
all
invitations
to
the
dance
she
tacked
on
to
the
tail
of
her
explanation
he
an
old
friend
of
mine
too
said
sir
lionel
and
we
not
only
invitations
already
but
have
accepted
them
and
sent
for
my
and
miss
lethbridge
clothes
her
face
fell
a
little
for
an
instant
when
she
heard
we
sent
for
clothes
as
probably
emily
and
i
would
have
suited
her
better
in
our
worst
things
but
she
brightened
up
and
said
how
pleased
she
was
because
she
and
dick
were
both
going
and
now
they
would
really
look
forward
to
the
dance
dick
had
been
bored
with
the
idea
before
well
the
boxes
came
in
good
time
and
the
bond
street
darlings
crushed
in
the
least
because
i
had
put
them
to
bed
so
nicely
with
sheets
and
pillows
of
tissue
paper
i
decided
to
wear
a
pink
chiffon
with
tiny
button
roses
laid
like
a
dainty
frame
all
round
the
low
neck
and
where
the
sleeves
ought
to
have
been
but
were
the
embroidered
with
roses
to
match
can
you
imagine
me
in
such
a
dream
i
ca
but
it
suits
me
rather
i
wore
pink
shoes
and
stockings
and
gloves
all
of
the
same
shade
and
poor
emily
in
gray
silk
with
her
hair
done
in
an
aggressively
virtuous
way
looked
like
a
cross
between
an
anglican
nun
and
a
tourist
economizing
luggage
yet
she
would
have
been
shocked
if
her
brother
had
a
harem
in
bengal
because
it
was
good
form
but
of
course
as
she
says
one
is
obliged
to
excuse
things
in
men
it
was
very
amusing
having
dinner
in
the
captain
room
which
was
large
and
quite
charming
with
curtains
and
frilly
silk
cushions
and
heaps
of
framed
signed
photographs
and
books
almost
as
if
a
woman
had
arranged
it
but
he
told
us
one
felt
the
motion
there
more
than
anywhere
else
in
a
storm
which
must
be
some
consolation
to
the
middies
who
have
to
work
for
years
before
they
can
ever
hope
for
such
luxurious
quarters
senter
and
dick
were
at
dinner
which
was
one
comfort
besides
ourselves
there
were
only
the
captain
married
sister
who
had
come
from
town
for
the
dance
and
her
husband
the
husband
an
earl
lord
knaresbrook
rather
old
but
lady
knaresbrook
is
young
frightfully
pretty
and
knows
it
she
flirted
fascinatingly
at
dinner
with
sir
lionel
not
as
senter
flirts
flickering
her
eyelashes
saying
smart
things
as
if
to
amuse
him
alone
and
hang
everyone
else
but
just
looking
at
him
with
gorgeous
starry
eyes
asking
a
question
now
and
then
and
listening
with
all
her
soul
i
not
sure
it
is
an
equally
effective
way
especially
when
done
in
a
diamond
tiara
by
a
countess
under
i
should
quite
have
enjoyed
watching
it
if
sir
lionel
had
been
a
stranger
but
knowing
him
somehow
made
me
feel
honour
not
to
look
and
rather
restless
i
do
believe
that
compared
with
some
of
these
men
who
been
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
for
years
doing
important
political
things
samson
with
his
hair
all
cropped
off
was
to
lovely
woman
naturally
i
had
to
have
something
to
look
at
and
i
could
look
at
lord
knaresbrook
because
the
shape
of
his
nose
worried
me
and
anyhow
he
wanted
to
talk
to
emily
about
people
they
both
knew
such
exciting
bits
as
this
floated
to
my
ears
ah
yes
was
the
of
lord
this
she
married
the
duke
of
that
second
cousin
so
i
looked
a
good
deal
at
captain
starlin
and
he
looked
at
me
and
not
at
very
much
else
which
was
quite
easy
the
most
important
lady
being
his
own
sister
who
took
the
place
of
hostess
so
norton
was
on
his
right
and
i
on
his
left
as
he
was
our
host
and
evidently
wanted
to
flirt
a
little
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
gratify
his
wish
and
played
up
to
him
that
was
quite
right
was
it
i
sure
you
say
yes
as
you
are
a
parisienne
and
have
brought
me
up
to
do
unto
others
as
i
would
be
done
by
but
several
times
i
happened
to
catch
sir
lionel
eyes
and
they
had
a
gloomy
glint
in
them
not
angry
but
as
if
he
discovered
a
screw
loose
in
me
i
felt
as
uncomfortable
as
you
do
with
a
smudge
on
your
nose
which
you
see
in
mirrors
when
you
forgotten
your
handkerchief
but
it
was
too
late
to
change
my
behaviour
suddenly
so
i
went
on
as
i
had
begun
we
mere
females
did
leave
the
men
at
the
table
perhaps
because
there
was
any
place
where
it
would
have
been
proper
for
us
to
wander
unmanned
we
sat
for
hours
and
lady
knaresbrook
smoked
and
wanted
us
to
smoke
though
of
course
she
must
have
known
that
no
woman
with
her
hair
done
like
emily
emily
looked
shocked
but
just
pressed
in
her
lips
and
did
disapprove
out
aloud
as
she
might
if
lady
knaresbrook
had
been
plain
but
afterward
she
told
me
she
was
now
ready
to
believe
all
they
say
about
diana
knaresbrook
just
because
she
smoked
norton
could
find
immorality
in
a
egg
if
she
looked
for
it
at
last
we
went
above
or
whatever
you
call
it
on
a
ship
and
everything
had
been
made
beautiful
with
flags
and
bunting
but
was
as
beautiful
as
those
sailor
men
themselves
especially
the
middies
i
felt
like
their
mother
i
hope
that
not
unmaidenly
and
should
have
loved
to
smooth
their
hair
and
pat
them
on
the
cheek
of
which
by
the
way
they
had
plenty
a
good
many
were
introduced
to
me
and
dick
brought
his
aunt
very
early
because
he
said
he
did
want
to
find
all
my
dances
gone
you
can
believe
i
had
saved
any
for
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
kept
back
two
thinking
sir
lionel
might
ask
me
for
after
his
many
kindnesses
i
should
have
liked
to
seem
not
to
want
to
dance
with
him
you
see
when
he
did
ask
at
first
i
supposed
it
might
be
because
he
was
a
dancing
man
horrid
expression
sounds
like
a
trained
bear
but
presently
i
saw
him
waltzing
with
lady
knaresbrook
and
he
danced
beautifully
as
if
he
done
nothing
else
all
those
years
in
bengal
then
i
said
to
myself
he
vexed
with
me
because
he
thinks
i
behaved
badly
at
dinner
and
perhaps
i
did
and
i
almost
hoped
he
would
suggest
sitting
out
a
dance
so
that
we
could
talk
but
then
dick
came
and
when
he
found
i
had
two
dances
he
wanted
them
both
there
are
things
i
must
tell
you
he
said
and
mother
it
easy
to
see
that
the
creature
has
some
talent
as
a
detective
because
he
guessed
at
once
why
i
been
saving
those
dances
it
no
good
keeping
anything
up
your
sleeve
for
pendragon
said
he
in
his
perky
way
as
if
he
were
on
an
equality
with
the
of
east
bengal
he
wo
ask
you
to
dance
he
thinks
you
a
little
girl
and
is
leaving
you
to
little
boys
like
me
which
is
quite
right
the
only
woman
he
ever
taken
any
interest
in
for
the
last
fifteen
years
is
aunt
gwen
and
you
ca
say
he
does
show
good
taste
i
could
especially
as
senter
was
looking
like
the
heroine
of
a
novel
which
you
be
sure
to
forbid
my
reading
so
i
gave
him
the
dances
partly
for
that
reason
and
partly
because
i
was
cowardly
enough
to
want
to
hear
what
he
had
to
tell
just
at
the
moment
he
could
say
more
though
because
a
sweet
brown
lamb
of
a
middy
came
and
whirled
me
away
so
it
went
on
for
half
the
evening
until
it
was
nearly
time
for
dick
burden
first
dance
and
i
was
sitting
down
to
breathe
after
a
furious
galop
which
did
go
at
all
well
with
a
directoire
dress
beside
norton
who
had
the
air
of
thinking
a
ballroom
a
sort
of
pound
for
lost
souls
up
came
sir
lionel
as
if
to
speak
to
her
and
i
do
know
what
made
me
do
it
i
said
i
saved
a
dance
for
you
but
you
never
asked
me
for
it
so
i
gave
it
to
someone
else
his
face
got
red
perhaps
he
thought
i
was
lecturing
him
for
being
rude
did
you
give
it
to
starlin
he
asked
bluntly
no
i
had
mine
with
captain
starlin
to
mr
burden
said
i
do
you
want
to
dance
it
with
him
not
at
all
chuck
him
then
and
dance
it
with
me
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
that
what
he
said
do
you
want
to
hear
what
he
got
to
say
well
you
know
dear
i
wanted
to
but
suddenly
i
felt
as
if
dick
did
matter
more
than
a
fly
nor
did
any
one
else
except
the
person
i
was
talking
to
you
feel
like
that
with
these
quiet
masterful
sort
of
people
whether
you
care
for
them
or
not
it
just
a
kind
of
momentary
hypnotism
or
at
least
that
the
definition
i
been
giving
myself
i
do
want
to
hear
what
he
got
to
say
my
hypnotized
me
answered
in
the
queer
abrupt
way
in
which
we
had
begun
snapping
out
little
short
sentences
to
each
other
i
sure
he
could
say
anything
really
interesting
do
you
like
dick
burden
not
much
then
the
dance
is
mine
which
is
it
the
next
here
he
comes
now
i
see
the
top
of
his
head
over
the
shoulder
of
that
youth
with
the
collar
of
a
curate
and
the
face
of
a
convict
the
dragon
smiled
benevolently
at
my
wicked
description
of
a
comparatively
inoffensive
person
and
whisked
me
off
are
you
offended
with
me
i
asked
as
we
waltzed
a
weird
but
heavenly
hungarian
waltz
made
in
germany
why
do
you
ask
that
he
wanted
to
know
because
you
looked
offended
at
dinner
what
had
i
done
eaten
something
with
the
wrong
fork
you
had
done
nothing
i
ought
to
have
been
prepared
to
see
you
do
what
ought
you
to
be
prepared
to
see
me
do
it
does
matter
now
it
does
if
you
do
tell
me
i
shall
scream
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
and
then
you
have
to
speak
i
certainly
would
i
bundle
you
home
at
once
i
have
got
any
home
my
home
is
yours
till
you
marry
or
you
do
do
talk
nonsense
he
was
probably
going
to
say
but
considered
such
striking
words
unfit
for
the
ear
of
a
débutante
this
my
début
i
suppose
my
very
first
ball
then
tell
me
what
you
were
unprepared
for
in
me
i
was
prepared
for
it
at
first
before
i
saw
you
but
what
well
if
you
will
have
it
for
your
flirting
suddenly
i
felt
impish
and
said
innocently
that
i
supposed
it
was
what
girls
came
on
board
to
do
so
i
had
only
done
my
best
to
please
by
this
time
we
stopped
dancing
and
were
sitting
down
forgotten
dick
burden
it
all
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
he
answered
with
rather
a
disgusted
air
my
point
of
view
is
said
i
gravely
that
soldiers
as
as
sailors
should
approve
of
flirting
because
flirtation
is
a
warlike
act
a
short
incursion
into
the
enemy
country
with
the
full
intention
of
getting
back
untouched
ah
but
what
of
the
enemy
suggested
the
dragon
he
can
always
take
care
of
himself
on
such
incursions
so
that
the
theory
and
at
nineteen
you
have
enlisted
in
that
army
what
army
the
great
army
of
flirts
i
could
keep
it
up
any
longer
for
i
had
really
started
in
to
explain
not
to
joke
and
you
know
dear
that
flirting
as
a
profession
would
be
in
my
line
at
all
do
i
look
like
a
flirt
i
asked
no
you
do
said
he
and
i
was
beginning
to
hope
please
go
on
hoping
then
i
said
because
i
did
want
to
behave
badly
if
i
did
it
was
because
i
do
quite
know
the
game
yet
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
did
really
mean
to
be
silly
and
schoolgirlish
and
disgrace
you
and
mrs
norton
then
it
was
his
turn
to
apologize
and
he
did
it
thoroughly
he
said
that
i
had
been
silly
and
so
far
from
disgracing
him
he
was
proud
of
me
proud
of
his
ward
it
was
only
that
i
seemed
so
much
more
womanly
and
companionable
than
he
expected
that
he
could
bear
to
see
in
me
or
think
he
saw
any
likeness
whatever
to
inferior
types
of
woman
whereupon
i
had
the
impertinence
to
ask
he
expected
me
to
be
inferior
but
the
only
explanation
i
could
get
him
to
make
was
that
he
did
know
much
about
girls
which
he
had
remarked
before
we
sat
out
two
dances
before
we
i
mean
i
knew
it
and
nobody
had
dared
to
come
near
us
because
a
middy
ca
very
well
snatch
a
partner
out
of
a
celebrity
pocket
and
dick
too
though
he
seems
to
have
the
courage
of
most
of
his
convictions
drew
the
line
at
that
but
suddenly
i
did
remember
i
smiled
at
a
hovering
laddie
with
the
most
smoothly
polished
hair
you
ever
saw
just
like
a
black
helmet
and
when
the
laddie
had
swung
me
away
in
the
merry
widow
waltz
sir
lionel
went
back
to
senter
rather
an
appropriate
air
for
her
to
dance
to
i
thought
i
do
pray
i
not
getting
anyhow
i
not
in
my
kittenhood
you
will
be
wondering
by
this
time
why
i
sorry
we
stayed
at
southsea
when
it
was
all
for
me
and
i
seem
to
have
been
having
the
time
of
my
life
but
i
coming
to
the
part
you
want
to
know
about
i
thought
perhaps
dick
burden
would
be
vexed
at
my
going
off
with
sir
lionel
under
his
nose
just
as
he
was
ready
to
say
my
dance
however
he
walked
up
to
me
as
if
nothing
had
happened
when
it
was
time
for
the
second
so
i
did
apologize
i
thought
it
best
to
let
sleeping
partners
lie
we
danced
a
little
but
dick
who
is
does
waltz
half
as
well
as
sir
lionel
who
is
forty
and
he
saw
that
i
thought
so
presently
he
asked
if
i
rather
sit
out
the
rest
and
i
answered
yes
so
he
said
he
would
tell
me
the
things
he
had
to
say
he
found
a
quiet
place
which
must
have
looked
as
if
deliberately
selected
for
a
desperate
flirtation
and
then
he
did
do
much
beating
about
the
bush
he
just
told
me
that
he
he
partly
detected
it
and
partly
found
out
by
chance
but
of
course
he
made
the
most
of
the
detecting
bit
do
be
frightened
and
get
a
palpitation
at
the
news
dearest
it
worth
it
there
going
to
be
no
of
course
if
i
were
the
heroine
of
a
really
nice
melodrama
in
such
a
scene
as
dick
and
i
went
through
i
should
have
been
accompanied
by
slow
music
with
every
time
i
turned
my
head
which
would
have
heartened
me
up
very
much
while
dick
would
have
had
villain
music
plink
plink
plunk
but
i
did
as
well
as
i
could
without
an
accompaniment
and
i
think
on
the
whole
managed
the
business
very
well
you
see
i
had
to
think
of
ellaline
i
dared
not
let
her
out
of
my
mind
for
a
single
instant
for
if
i
should
fail
her
now
at
the
crucial
time
it
would
be
my
fault
if
her
love
story
burst
and
went
up
the
spout
if
i
stopped
thinking
of
her
and
saying
in
my
mind
while
dick
talked
i
must
save
ellaline
no
matter
what
happens
to
me
i
should
certainly
have
boxed
his
ears
and
told
him
to
go
to
limbo
he
began
by
telling
me
that
he
met
a
friend
of
mine
a
miss
bennett
kathy
bennett
oh
mother
just
for
a
minute
my
heart
beat
under
my
pretty
frock
like
a
bird
caught
in
a
child
hand
you
remember
my
writing
you
what
a
friendship
ellaline
and
kathy
struck
up
before
kathy
left
school
to
go
back
to
england
and
how
she
sent
ellaline
cuttings
from
the
london
radical
papers
about
sir
lionel
pendragon
in
bengal
i
do
think
it
almost
ungentlemanly
of
so
many
coincidences
to
happen
in
connection
with
what
i
trying
to
do
for
ellaline
but
kathy
such
a
lump
it
too
great
a
compliment
to
call
her
a
coincidence
anyhow
dick
met
her
in
town
at
a
tea
party
a
bun
worry
he
called
it
where
he
went
with
his
dear
aunt
gwen
and
when
kathy
mentioned
being
at
school
at
madame
de
maluet
he
asked
if
she
knew
miss
lethbridge
she
said
of
course
she
did
and
she
thought
ellaline
was
a
very
naughty
little
thing
not
to
write
or
come
and
see
her
she
had
read
in
the
papers
about
the
arrival
of
sir
lionel
with
his
sister
and
ward
you
see
dick
remarked
that
he
hardly
call
miss
lethbridge
a
little
thing
whereupon
kathy
defended
her
adjective
by
saying
ellaline
was
only
about
up
to
her
ear
of
course
that
set
dick
detective
bump
to
throbbing
furiously
he
reassured
me
by
announcing
that
he
had
said
any
more
to
kathy
but
that
he
thought
a
lot
in
fact
he
thought
so
much
that
he
asked
if
she
give
him
a
line
of
introduction
to
madame
as
he
had
a
cousin
who
wanted
to
go
to
a
french
school
and
next
time
he
ran
across
to
paris
he
might
have
a
look
at
versailles
kathy
gave
the
note
and
that
same
night
if
you
believe
it
the
horrid
little
boy
did
run
across
at
the
earliest
hour
possible
in
the
morning
he
called
at
the
school
only
to
find
madame
already
away
for
her
holidays
but
you
know
she
always
leaves
her
sister
mademoiselle
prado
to
look
after
things
and
when
mademoiselle
heard
what
dick
wanted
she
showed
him
all
over
the
place
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
photographs
of
the
young
ladies
in
groups
if
any
such
existed
because
he
could
write
his
australian
cousin
what
nice
girls
they
were
promptly
that
poor
unsuspecting
female
produced
the
big
picture
madame
had
done
of
the
on
the
lawn
a
year
ago
in
june
and
there
was
i
in
it
but
dick
was
too
foxy
to
begin
by
asking
questions
about
me
kathy
adorned
the
photograph
also
with
ellaline
on
her
right
and
me
in
the
perspective
of
her
left
ear
which
must
have
seemed
to
point
at
me
accusingly
dick
could
claim
kathy
quite
naturally
as
he
come
with
her
letter
and
presently
he
led
up
to
me
saying
he
seemed
to
have
seen
me
somewhere
was
i
a
great
friend
of
miss
bennett
and
was
it
probable
that
she
had
my
portrait
mademoiselle
innocently
said
no
miss
bennett
was
much
more
likely
to
have
mees
lethbridge
portrait
than
mees
brendon
as
mees
brendon
was
not
a
pupil
of
the
school
only
a
teacher
of
singing
and
mees
kathy
was
not
musical
but
mees
lethbridge
petite
jeune
on
the
right
was
a
friend
of
mees
bennett
now
you
admit
that
dick
was
rather
smart
to
have
chopped
all
these
branches
off
the
tree
of
knowledge
with
his
little
hatchet
i
think
his
cleverness
worthy
of
a
better
cause
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
ask
naïvely
if
miss
lethbridge
was
miss
lethbridge
the
ward
of
sir
lionel
pendragon
so
much
talked
of
in
the
papers
just
now
proud
that
her
sister
school
had
moulded
a
celebrity
mademoiselle
chatted
away
about
ellaline
saying
what
a
dear
child
she
was
how
sorry
madame
was
to
part
from
her
and
how
madame
de
blanchemain
ellaline
at
st
cloud
must
be
missing
her
at
this
very
moment
it
goes
without
saying
that
dick
next
step
took
him
at
a
single
stride
to
st
cloud
he
did
call
on
madame
de
blanchemain
not
wishing
to
stir
up
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
but
simply
pryed
and
peered
and
did
all
sorts
of
sneaky
things
only
excusable
in
a
professional
detective
who
must
or
thinks
he
must
live
he
found
out
about
madame
de
blanchemain
nephew
ellaline
honoré
and
put
this
and
that
together
until
he
patched
up
the
theory
of
a
love
affair
but
further
he
dared
not
go
on
that
track
so
he
pranced
back
to
versailles
and
found
out
things
about
audrie
brendon
the
way
he
did
that
was
through
noticing
the
name
of
the
versailles
photographer
who
took
the
group
in
the
garden
dick
called
on
him
and
said
he
wanted
a
copy
of
the
picture
because
his
cousin
was
in
it
the
man
had
several
on
hand
as
parents
occasionally
wrote
for
them
and
when
dick
got
his
he
inquired
who
i
was
the
obliging
photographer
perhaps
scenting
a
romance
told
him
i
lived
in
the
rue
chapeau
de
marie
antoinette
with
my
mother
then
the
wretch
actually
had
the
impudence
to
describe
to
me
a
visit
he
paid
our
apartment
ringing
at
the
door
and
asking
dear
philomene
for
madame
brendon
in
five
minutes
he
had
heard
all
our
family
affairs
as
far
as
that
dear
simple
talkative
soul
could
tell
him
that
you
were
in
switzerland
and
i
had
gone
to
england
to
visit
a
friend
i
sat
and
listened
to
the
end
of
the
story
saying
never
a
word
though
i
was
in
one
of
the
moods
which
make
me
a
person
that
nobody
but
myself
could
stand
for
a
moment
i
should
simply
have
smiled
if
wild
horses
had
come
along
to
tear
him
in
two
so
you
see
said
he
at
last
when
i
did
speak
i
in
the
game
with
you
it
is
my
game
said
i
you
playing
it
said
he
because
i
have
to
said
i
is
it
sir
lionel
who
making
you
play
it
he
asked
oh
dear
no
i
broke
out
before
i
stopped
to
think
then
he
is
in
it
i
thought
it
looked
more
respectable
to
admit
that
whatever
the
game
was
sir
lionel
and
i
were
not
playing
it
together
you
doing
it
for
your
friend
deduced
our
young
detective
i
gently
intimated
that
that
was
business
but
mr
burden
advised
me
that
i
would
be
wise
to
accept
him
as
my
partner
if
i
did
want
the
business
to
fail
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
you
should
interfere
i
wanted
to
know
only
i
did
dare
actually
did
for
ellaline
sake
to
speak
angrily
oh
i
did
feel
like
a
worm
paper
doll
you
made
me
like
you
awfully
he
said
then
you
should
want
to
do
me
any
harm
i
suggested
i
do
want
to
do
you
harm
he
defended
himself
what
i
want
is
to
see
as
much
of
you
as
possible
and
also
i
like
to
give
aunt
gwen
a
little
pleasure
thrown
in
with
mine
i
want
you
to
ask
sir
lionel
to
invite
us
to
join
your
party
there
plenty
of
room
for
us
in
that
big
of
his
i
went
to
see
it
in
the
garage
you
i
could
resist
sputtering
but
he
took
no
notice
you
need
be
afraid
that
aunt
gwen
in
this
he
went
on
to
assure
me
i
kept
mum
as
an
oyster
all
she
knows
is
that
i
saw
you
miss
lethbridge
in
paris
and
have
been
the
same
man
since
she
helped
me
get
to
know
you
of
course
she
a
great
chum
of
mine
and
her
being
an
old
pal
of
sir
lionel
too
meant
a
lot
for
me
in
the
beginning
a
ripper
and
stanch
as
they
make
but
they
make
perfectly
stanch
where
other
women
are
concerned
and
as
long
as
you
and
i
hunt
in
couples
she
sha
have
a
suspicion
you
tell
her
if
i
refused
to
hunt
in
that
way
i
asked
i
might
think
it
my
duty
to
let
sir
lionel
know
how
he
being
humbugged
at
present
i
shuttin
my
eyes
to
duty
and
lookin
at
you
what
why
does
senter
want
to
come
with
us
i
ventured
to
inquire
because
explained
her
loyal
nephew
she
fed
up
with
visiting
and
she
loves
motoring
so
do
i
with
the
right
people
i
sure
it
not
much
to
ask
we
wo
sponge
on
sir
lionel
we
pay
our
own
hotel
bills
and
i
sure
even
though
you
are
in
a
wax
with
me
just
now
you
must
admit
aunt
gwen
and
i
would
wake
things
up
a
bit
what
all
fair
in
love
and
war
so
you
ought
to
blame
me
for
anything
i
done
you
think
it
jolly
well
romantic
if
you
read
it
in
a
book
i
denied
this
but
said
i
would
consider
he
must
give
me
till
morning
to
make
up
my
mind
which
he
flatly
refused
to
do
would
be
too
late
he
saw
in
my
eye
that
i
hoped
to
slip
off
but
it
was
no
good
my
being
foxy
things
must
be
fixed
up
or
up
on
board
this
ship
whether
or
not
he
really
meant
to
do
his
worst
if
i
would
give
in
i
ca
be
sure
but
he
looked
as
obstinate
as
six
pigs
and
i
did
dare
risk
ellaline
future
my
impression
is
that
there
a
mistake
somewhere
and
that
she
would
be
perfectly
safe
in
sir
hands
if
she
would
tell
him
frankly
all
about
honoré
du
guesclin
i
meanwhile
vanishing
through
a
stage
trap
or
something
but
she
may
be
right
and
i
be
wrong
that
why
i
was
forced
to
promise
dick
and
i
kept
my
promise
as
soon
as
we
got
home
to
our
hotel
sir
lionel
norton
and
i
knew
it
would
be
a
most
horrid
thing
to
do
but
it
was
even
horrider
than
i
thought
all
the
way
going
back
i
was
planning
what
to
say
and
feeling
damp
on
the
forehead
thinking
how
impudent
it
would
seem
in
a
young
girl
and
a
guest
to
make
such
a
suggestion
but
it
had
to
be
done
so
i
screwed
up
my
courage
swallowed
half
of
it
again
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
and
exclaimed
in
a
gay
spontaneous
way
like
the
sweet
innocent
angel
i
am
oh
sir
lionel
it
be
fun
if
senter
and
and
her
nephew
were
going
with
us
for
a
little
way
they
both
love
motoring
he
looked
surprised
and
emily
pursed
her
lips
do
you
want
them
to
come
he
asked
well
i
just
thought
of
it
i
stammered
i
thought
you
did
like
burden
he
said
no
wonder
as
unfortunately
unbosomed
myself
of
my
real
sentiments
not
three
hours
before
i
think
he
amusing
enough
i
tried
to
slide
out
of
the
difficulty
and
senter
probably
would
go
without
him
i
somehow
gathered
an
impression
that
you
did
admire
her
particularly
went
on
sir
lionel
looking
at
me
with
a
very
straight
look
oh
i
never
said
so
i
cried
i
admire
her
immensely
in
that
case
i
ask
them
with
pleasure
said
sir
lionel
the
idea
did
cross
my
mind
in
london
but
i
did
think
you
care
for
it
somehow
emily
will
be
pleased
i
know
wo
you
emily
and
if
senter
will
be
as
reasonable
as
you
two
in
the
matter
of
luggage
we
shall
have
plenty
of
room
it
is
your
car
and
the
idea
of
the
tour
is
yours
said
norton
very
feminine
and
resigned
also
feeling
that
my
cheek
deserved
a
tiny
scratch
i
am
pleased
with
whatever
pleases
next
morning
or
rather
the
morning
and
morning
sir
lionel
got
his
sister
to
write
a
note
to
senter
and
he
wrote
one
too
or
added
a
aunt
gwen
reply
was
a
ladylike
warwhoop
of
joy
and
we
are
now
waiting
till
the
latest
additions
to
our
party
have
broken
the
news
to
their
hostess
at
hayling
island
packed
a
few
things
to
take
and
sent
the
rest
home
wherever
that
may
be
with
senter
maid
my
parisienne
angel
your
broken
and
badly
repaired
i
long
to
hear
whether
you
think
i
ought
to
have
braved
dick
x
sir
lionel
pendragon
to
colonel
patrick
hotel
my
dear
pat
i
thought
of
you
on
the
portsmouth
downs
yesterday
remembering
a
tramp
you
and
i
had
together
exploring
wild
england
as
we
called
it
we
then
had
a
pose
that
all
england
except
town
was
wild
save
only
and
always
when
there
was
any
shooting
of
poor
silly
pheasants
or
hunting
of
that
pleasant
little
gentleman
the
fox
after
running
out
through
portsmouth
i
suggested
stopping
the
car
and
mounting
the
downs
above
on
foot
for
a
look
at
the
view
there
are
now
five
in
our
party
instead
of
three
not
counting
young
nick
who
has
no
stomach
for
views
at
ellaline
expressed
wish
senter
and
dick
burden
have
come
on
with
us
from
hayling
island
where
they
were
staying
we
met
them
at
a
dance
on
the
which
starlin
captains
they
have
been
invited
to
be
of
the
party
for
a
fortnight
or
so
i
should
rather
have
liked
to
watch
ellaline
face
as
she
climbed
the
hill
her
feet
light
on
yielding
grass
where
the
gold
of
buttercups
and
turquoise
of
harebells
lay
scattered
as
she
climbed
and
as
she
reached
the
top
to
see
england
spread
under
her
eyes
like
a
great
ring
but
that
privilege
was
burden
i
hope
he
appreciated
it
mine
was
to
escort
senter
i
was
glad
she
did
chat
i
hate
women
who
chat
or
spray
adjectives
over
a
view
you
remember
it
all
do
you
on
one
side
looking
landward
we
had
a
constable
picture
a
sky
with
tumbled
clouds
shadowed
downs
and
forests
cleft
by
a
golden
mosaic
of
meadows
seaward
an
impressionist
sketch
of
whistler
southampton
water
and
historic
portsmouth
harbour
stretches
of
glittering
sand
with
the
sea
lying
in
ragged
patches
on
it
here
and
there
like
great
pieces
of
broken
glass
over
all
the
english
sunshine
pale
as
an
alloy
of
gold
and
silver
not
too
dazzling
yet
discreetly
cheerful
like
a
puritan
maiden
smile
but
not
like
ellaline
hers
can
be
dazzling
when
she
is
surprised
and
pleased
i
think
i
recall
your
talk
with
me
on
a
height
overlooking
the
harbour
perhaps
the
same
height
we
painted
a
lurid
picture
to
harrow
our
young
minds
of
the
wreck
of
the
and
we
said
gazing
across
the
downs
that
england
looked
almost
uninhabited
well
it
appears
no
more
populous
now
luckily
for
the
picture
i
heard
ellaline
saying
to
dick
burden
that
the
towns
and
villages
might
be
playing
at
hide
and
seek
they
concealed
themselves
so
successfully
also
i
heard
her
advise
him
to
read
puck
of
pook
hill
and
was
somewhat
disappointed
that
she
already
had
it
as
i
bought
it
for
her
in
southsea
yesterday
probably
she
wo
care
to
read
it
again
perhaps
i
had
better
give
the
book
to
senter
who
is
a
more
intellectual
woman
than
you
and
i
supposed
when
she
was
playing
with
us
all
in
india
but
one
does
talk
books
with
pretty
women
in
the
east
you
remember
the
day
you
and
i
walked
to
winchester
from
portsmouth
starting
early
in
the
morning
with
our
lunch
in
our
pockets
well
we
came
along
the
same
way
past
old
william
of
wykeham
wickham
the
queer
mill
built
of
the
timbers
and
bishops
waltham
where
the
ruins
of
the
episcopal
palace
struck
me
as
being
grander
than
i
had
realized
ellaline
was
astonished
at
coming
upon
such
a
splendid
monument
of
the
past
by
the
roadside
and
was
delighted
to
hear
of
the
entertainment
coeur
de
lion
was
given
in
the
palace
after
his
return
from
the
german
captivity
of
course
the
story
of
the
famous
waltham
blacks
pleased
her
too
women
can
always
forgive
thieves
provided
they
young
gay
and
well
born
when
senter
found
that
ellaline
and
my
sister
were
in
the
habit
of
sitting
in
the
tonneau
young
nick
beside
me
she
asked
after
a
little
hesitation
if
she
might
take
his
place
leaving
the
chauffeur
to
curl
himself
up
on
the
emergency
seat
at
my
feet
she
said
that
half
the
fun
of
motoring
was
to
sit
by
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
share
his
impressions
like
being
in
the
forefront
of
battle
or
going
to
the
first
performance
of
a
play
or
being
in
at
the
death
with
a
hunt
so
now
you
can
imagine
me
with
an
amusing
neighbour
for
naturally
i
consented
to
the
change
neither
ellaline
nor
emily
had
suggested
companioning
me
and
though
i
must
say
i
had
thought
of
proposing
it
to
ellaline
i
had
found
the
courage
she
would
no
doubt
have
been
too
polite
to
refuse
while
perhaps
disliking
the
plan
heartily
now
burden
has
been
allotted
a
place
with
her
and
my
sister
which
is
probably
agreeable
to
ellaline
curious
even
the
frankest
of
girls
and
i
believe
ellaline
to
be
as
frank
as
her
sex
allows
can
be
secretive
in
an
apparently
motiveless
way
why
should
she
tell
me
one
moment
that
she
did
like
burden
and
the
next
practically
ask
me
to
invite
him
and
his
aunt
to
travel
with
us
because
she
admires
senter
immensely
or
perhaps
it
is
that
the
child
does
know
her
own
mind
i
am
studying
her
with
deepening
interest
but
am
not
likely
to
have
as
many
opportunities
now
there
are
more
of
us
she
and
burden
being
the
young
girl
and
the
young
man
of
the
party
will
of
course
be
much
together
and
senter
will
fall
to
my
lot
for
any
excursions
which
may
not
interest
or
be
too
tiring
for
emily
this
boy
presence
makes
me
realize
as
i
did
until
i
had
a
young
man
of
constantly
under
my
eyes
that
the
knocking
of
the
younger
generation
has
already
begun
to
sound
on
my
door
i
had
better
hearken
i
suppose
or
some
one
else
will
kindly
direct
my
attention
to
the
noise
i
confess
i
do
like
it
but
best
to
know
the
worst
and
keep
the
knowledge
in
the
heart
rather
than
read
it
in
the
mockery
of
some
pretty
girl
eyes
a
pretty
girl
to
whom
one
is
an
old
boy
perhaps
jove
pat
that
sticks
in
my
gorge
it
not
a
thought
to
take
to
bed
and
go
to
sleep
with
if
one
wants
pleasant
dreams
i
stronger
than
i
ever
was
my
health
is
perfect
i
have
few
gray
hairs
my
back
is
straight
i
feel
as
if
the
elixir
of
youth
ran
hot
in
my
veins
yet
one
sees
headlines
in
the
papers
too
old
at
forty
and
one
is
forty
it
did
matter
that
is
i
did
think
of
it
until
the
coming
of
this
boy
his
very
ideas
and
manners
are
different
from
mine
no
doubt
they
the
approved
ideas
and
manners
of
his
generation
as
we
had
ours
at
his
age
i
wear
my
hair
short
and
think
no
more
of
its
existence
except
to
wash
and
brush
it
but
this
dick
parts
his
in
the
middle
and
sleeks
the
long
locks
back
keeping
them
smooth
as
a
surface
of
yellowish
satin
with
bear
grease
or
lard
or
some
appalling
perfumed
compound
his
look
is
a
mixture
of
laziness
and
impudence
and
half
his
sentences
he
ends
up
with
what
or
even
his
way
with
women
is
slightly
condescending
and
takes
their
approval
for
granted
there
no
youthful
shyness
about
him
and
what
he
wants
he
expects
to
get
but
with
he
puts
on
an
irritating
though
i
fear
conscientious
air
of
deference
that
relegates
me
to
the
background
of
an
older
generation
sets
me
on
a
pedestal
there
perhaps
but
i
have
no
wish
for
a
pedestal
still
to
do
him
justice
the
lad
is
neither
nor
indeed
women
may
consider
him
engaging
his
aunt
seems
devoted
to
him
and
says
he
is
irresistible
to
girls
i
think
if
no
greenery
yallery
haze
floated
before
my
eyes
i
might
see
that
he
is
rather
a
decent
boy
extremely
alert
with
good
short
features
and
bright
eyes
when
he
walks
with
ellaline
he
has
no
more
than
an
inch
the
advantage
of
her
in
height
but
he
has
a
figure
and
a
sandhurst
bearing
crabbed
age
and
youth
can
not
live
together
am
i
crabbed
age
well
this
long
digression
ought
to
bring
me
on
as
far
as
winchester
where
we
came
yesterday
afternoon
late
we
should
have
been
earlier
though
our
start
was
delayed
by
our
guests
preparations
but
ellaline
was
fascinated
by
the
pretty
village
of
twyford
you
remember
it
been
reading
it
up
in
a
and
would
stop
for
a
look
at
the
place
where
the
fair
fitzherbert
was
said
to
have
been
married
to
her
handsome
prince
later
george
iv
i
ca
recall
hearing
that
story
though
certainly
fitzherbert
relations
lived
near
but
i
knew
pope
was
sent
down
from
school
there
because
of
a
satire
he
wrote
on
the
master
and
that
franklin
visited
and
wrote
in
twyford
it
was
after
four
when
i
turned
the
car
round
that
sharp
corner
which
swings
you
into
the
market
square
of
what
is
to
me
the
grandest
and
most
historic
town
of
england
why
it
england
did
the
romans
get
their
venta
belgarum
which
finally
developed
into
and
winchester
from
the
far
older
celtic
name
for
an
important
citadel
was
there
a
christian
church
before
the
days
of
arthur
my
alleged
ancestor
was
the
cathedral
begun
by
the
father
of
ælfred
on
the
foundations
of
that
poor
church
as
well
as
those
of
a
roman
temple
was
it
here
that
the
name
of
anglia
england
was
bestowed
on
the
united
kingdoms
and
was
it
from
winchester
that
ælfred
sent
out
the
laws
that
made
him
and
england
great
ellaline
delights
in
the
fact
that
the
said
roman
temple
was
apollo
as
well
as
concord
she
having
named
my
car
apollo
and
the
sun
god
being
her
favourite
mythological
deity
at
the
moment
apropos
of
mythology
by
the
way
she
was
rather
amusing
this
morning
on
the
subject
of
icarus
who
she
contends
was
the
pioneer
of
sporting
travel
if
he
did
have
tire
trouble
said
she
he
had
the
nearest
equivalent
when
his
wax
wings
melted
i
should
have
enjoyed
playing
cicerone
in
winchester
knowing
and
loving
the
place
as
i
do
if
it
had
been
for
dick
burden
air
of
thinking
such
knowledge
as
mine
quite
the
luggage
of
the
old
fogy
there
no
use
pretending
it
did
rub
me
up
the
wrong
way
yesterday
after
arriving
emily
clamoured
for
tea
so
we
attempted
no
further
sightseeing
but
drove
straight
to
this
delightful
old
hotel
which
was
once
a
nunnery
and
has
still
the
nunnery
garden
loved
by
the
more
enterprising
of
cathedral
rooks
or
are
they
the
nuns
come
back
in
disguise
this
you
guess
is
ellaline
idea
on
the
way
here
however
there
was
the
beautiful
city
cross
in
the
high
street
it
would
have
been
a
disgrace
not
to
stop
for
a
look
at
it
even
though
we
could
return
and
ellaline
was
most
enthusiastic
she
know
much
about
these
things
how
could
she
but
she
feels
by
instinct
the
beauty
of
all
that
is
really
fine
whereas
senter
though
maybe
better
instructed
is
more
indeed
though
she
admires
the
right
things
she
is
essentially
the
modern
woman
whose
interest
is
all
in
the
present
and
future
i
ca
imagine
her
reading
history
for
the
sheer
joy
of
it
as
the
child
would
and
evidently
has
senter
would
prefer
a
french
novel
but
it
would
have
to
be
well
written
she
would
accept
no
trash
she
has
an
elastic
mind
i
must
say
and
appeared
satisfactorily
shocked
when
i
told
her
how
the
cross
would
have
been
chopped
up
by
paving
commissioners
in
the
eighteenth
century
if
the
people
had
howled
for
its
salvation
the
same
sort
of
fellows
did
dump
ælfred
and
his
queen
out
of
their
comfortable
stone
coffins
you
know
to
use
the
stone
brutes
what
was
swithin
thinking
of
to
let
them
do
it
a
mercy
it
did
occur
to
some
commission
to
take
down
stonehenge
they
could
have
made
a
lot
of
streets
with
that
in
the
market
place
too
there
was
the
ancient
fair
of
winchester
to
think
of
the
fair
that
had
no
rival
except
beaucaire
and
i
had
been
telling
them
all
on
the
way
into
the
town
how
the
woods
round
the
city
used
to
swarm
with
robbers
hoping
to
plunder
the
rich
merchants
from
far
countries
altogether
i
fancy
even
dick
was
somewhat
impressed
by
the
ancient
as
well
as
modern
importance
of
winchester
by
the
time
we
drove
to
the
hotel
by
and
by
when
we
had
our
rooms
and
were
washed
and
refreshed
we
drank
tea
in
the
garden
where
flowers
were
sweet
plenty
of
roses
stocks
and
pansies
i
had
an
old
scottish
nurse
when
i
was
a
foot
or
two
high
and
i
never
forgotten
what
she
said
about
pansies
they
have
aye
the
face
of
a
smacked
cat
it
true
is
it
a
cat
glares
and
puts
its
ears
back
when
it
smacked
not
that
i
ever
smacked
one
to
see
afterward
i
was
not
of
a
mind
to
propose
anything
i
thought
each
had
better
follow
his
or
her
inclination
for
what
was
left
of
the
day
and
mine
was
to
stroll
out
and
review
old
memories
i
should
have
liked
to
take
ellaline
but
fancied
she
might
prefer
society
nearer
her
own
age
however
i
came
across
her
in
the
high
street
alone
gazing
fascinated
at
the
window
of
an
antique
shop
there
are
some
attractive
ones
in
winchester
i
was
sure
if
she
were
waiting
for
dick
who
might
have
strolled
away
from
her
for
a
minute
so
i
would
have
passed
on
if
she
turned
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
beautiful
she
asked
me
i
had
but
i
did
say
so
i
liked
her
to
like
everything
in
my
winchester
so
i
inquired
what
she
admired
most
in
the
shop
window
she
hardly
knew
but
there
was
some
wonderful
old
jewellery
the
girl
was
right
the
antique
jewellery
was
particularly
good
there
were
some
admirable
necklaces
and
rings
with
fine
stones
what
your
birth
month
i
asked
on
a
sudden
thought
july
said
she
what
this
very
month
i
hope
the
birthday
has
passed
not
yet
she
answered
reluctantly
she
saw
by
now
what
was
in
the
wind
and
did
want
to
seem
greedy
i
persisted
tell
me
when
the
but
you
are
to
not
to
what
you
know
yes
i
will
it
a
guardian
duty
to
his
ward
and
in
this
case
a
pleasure
i
much
rather
you
did
really
and
she
looked
as
grave
as
a
statue
of
justice
some
day
you
know
why
i
waived
the
subject
at
this
point
for
i
felt
obstinate
and
wanted
to
give
her
a
present
there
was
and
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
her
reason
is
a
schoolgirl
reason
madame
de
maluet
has
probably
brought
her
up
to
believe
it
is
not
il
for
a
to
accept
a
present
from
a
still
her
voice
and
expression
were
so
serious
even
worried
that
i
wondering
if
it
could
be
anything
else
anyhow
i
have
bought
the
present
and
intend
to
give
it
her
on
the
it
is
a
quaint
old
marquise
ring
with
a
cabuchon
ruby
surrounded
by
very
good
diamonds
i
think
she
will
like
it
and
i
do
see
why
she
should
have
it
from
me
i
feel
as
if
i
would
like
to
make
up
to
her
for
the
injustice
i
been
doing
her
in
my
mind
all
these
years
since
she
was
a
little
child
left
to
me
poor
lonely
baby
only
i
quite
know
how
to
make
up
i
do
even
dare
to
confess
myself
and
say
i
am
sorry
i
never
seemed
to
take
any
interest
in
her
as
she
grew
up
she
must
have
wondered
why
i
never
asked
to
have
her
picture
sent
me
or
wanted
her
to
write
or
wrote
and
she
must
have
felt
the
cold
neglect
of
the
only
person
except
an
old
french
lady
her
godmother
who
had
any
rights
over
her
beast
that
i
was
and
i
ca
explain
why
i
was
a
beast
no
doubt
she
adores
the
legend
it
ca
be
a
memory
of
her
mother
and
i
would
have
it
always
so
she
need
never
know
any
of
the
truth
though
of
course
when
she
marries
i
shall
have
to
tell
the
man
one
or
two
things
i
suppose
i
let
you
know
next
time
i
write
how
the
ring
is
received
this
morning
after
breakfast
we
all
walked
about
the
streets
of
winchester
and
of
course
went
to
the
cathedral
where
we
stopped
till
nearly
two
the
town
and
the
place
have
all
their
old
charm
and
even
more
for
me
the
piazza
the
huddled
narrow
streets
full
of
mystery
the
cathedral
close
with
its
crowded
entrance
its
tall
trees
that
try
to
hide
cathedral
glories
from
common
eyes
its
mellow
queen
anne
and
georgian
houses
which
group
round
in
a
pleasant
way
as
if
they
alone
were
worthy
of
in
that
sacred
precinct
to
me
there
no
cathedral
in
england
that
means
as
much
of
the
past
as
winchester
you
know
how
in
the
nave
you
see
so
plainly
the
transition
from
one
architectural
period
to
another
and
then
there
are
those
splendid
mortuary
chests
think
of
old
kynegils
and
the
other
saxon
kings
lying
inside
little
heaps
of
haunted
dust
i
was
silly
enough
to
be
immensely
pleased
that
the
child
picked
out
those
mortuary
chests
in
their
high
resting
place
and
the
gorgeous
alleged
tomb
of
william
rufus
as
the
most
unforgettable
among
the
smaller
interests
of
winchester
cathedral
for
they
are
the
same
with
me
and
it
human
to
like
our
tastes
shared
by
a
few
others
she
was
so
enchanted
to
hear
how
william
the
red
was
brought
by
a
carter
to
be
buried
in
winchester
and
about
the
great
turquoise
and
the
broken
shaft
of
wood
found
in
the
tomb
that
i
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
it
probably
was
his
burial
place
but
that
of
henri
de
blois
of
course
she
liked
bloody
mary
faldstool
the
one
mary
sat
in
for
her
marriage
with
philip
of
spain
and
the
mss
signed
by
ælfred
the
great
as
a
child
with
his
father
women
are
caught
by
the
personal
element
i
think
more
than
we
are
and
so
interested
was
she
in
jane
austen
memorial
tablet
that
she
would
be
satisfied
without
going
to
see
the
house
where
jane
died
there
were
so
many
other
things
to
see
that
emily
and
senter
would
have
left
that
out
but
i
wanted
the
girl
to
have
her
way
poor
little
jane
she
was
only
when
she
finished
with
this
world
a
year
older
than
i
but
doubtless
that
was
almost
old
for
a
woman
of
her
day
when
girls
married
at
sixteen
and
took
to
caps
at
now
i
notice
half
the
mothers
look
younger
than
their
daughters
younger
than
any
daughter
would
dare
to
look
after
she
was
out
a
good
many
interesting
persons
seem
to
have
died
in
winchester
if
they
were
clever
enough
to
be
born
in
the
town
earl
godwin
set
an
early
example
in
that
respect
died
eating
with
edward
the
confessor
probably
too
much
as
his
death
was
caused
by
apoplexy
and
might
not
have
happened
if
edward
had
been
too
polite
to
advise
him
not
to
stuff
of
course
the
cathedral
is
the
great
jewel
but
for
me
the
old
city
is
an
ancient
kingly
crown
set
full
of
jewels
there
the
west
gate
for
instance
you
know
how
we
said
it
alone
would
be
worth
walking
many
miles
to
see
and
the
old
castle
i
not
sure
that
is
one
of
the
best
sights
of
all
i
took
the
party
there
after
luncheon
and
the
same
delightful
fellow
showed
us
round
he
had
changed
since
our
time
unless
he
is
more
mellow
he
was
quite
angry
with
a
woman
the
type
as
ellaline
murmured
to
me
that
alone
is
capable
of
a
plaid
blouse
the
lady
inquired
nasally
of
our
old
friend
is
this
hall
what
you
call
we
were
at
the
moment
gazing
up
at
king
arthur
round
table
which
henry
viii
hung
on
the
wall
to
save
it
further
vicissitudes
after
henry
vii
had
it
daubed
with
colours
and
tudor
roses
to
furnish
forth
some
silly
feast
the
dear
old
chap
raised
his
eyebrows
at
the
question
and
glanced
round
as
if
apologizing
to
each
massive
pillar
in
turn
well
he
said
he
would
hardly
call
the
hall
modern
as
it
had
been
built
by
william
the
conqueror
but
perhaps
the
lady
be
used
to
older
things
at
home
with
that
he
turned
on
an
indignant
heel
and
led
us
out
to
the
courtyard
where
wretched
edward
ii
brother
the
duke
of
kent
was
executed
he
has
the
same
old
trick
of
being
sorry
to
say
whenever
he
has
anything
tragic
or
gruesome
to
relate
passing
lightly
over
details
of
oubliettes
and
skeletons
found
without
their
heads
as
so
many
were
on
grim
giles
hill
of
course
we
went
and
had
a
look
at
cross
and
henri
de
blois
old
hospital
almshouse
we
would
have
stopped
there
yesterday
if
emily
had
so
ardently
desired
tea
but
if
i
thought
to
tell
her
about
the
dole
of
bread
and
beer
she
might
have
been
persuaded
though
my
description
of
the
exquisite
windows
in
the
courtyard
and
the
quaint
houses
of
the
black
and
white
brethren
left
her
cold
we
all
had
some
of
the
dole
at
the
portal
and
senter
took
it
as
a
compliment
that
each
one
was
given
so
little
tourists
get
tiny
bits
you
know
and
beggars
big
ones
so
she
thought
it
would
have
been
a
sign
that
they
disparaged
the
ladies
hats
and
frocks
if
they
had
been
more
generous
it
would
be
difficult
to
disapprove
of
hers
she
understands
the
art
of
dress
to
perfection
a
pity
we
could
have
been
here
earlier
in
the
year
is
it
for
among
the
nicest
new
things
in
old
winchester
are
the
winchester
schoolboys
how
they
spurn
the
ordinary
tourist
they
meet
in
the
street
and
how
scornfully
polite
they
are
to
any
unfortunate
straying
beast
who
asks
them
a
question
making
him
feel
meaner
than
any
worm
a
foreigner
must
long
to
ask
the
consequential
youths
to
kindly
excuse
him
while
he
continues
to
breathe
for
few
strangers
can
sympathize
with
the
contempt
we
english
have
while
still
in
callow
youth
for
everyone
we
do
know
but
let
a
newcomer
blossom
into
an
acquaintance
or
mention
a
relative
at
eton
and
all
is
changed
the
winchester
boys
turn
into
the
most
delightful
chaps
in
the
world
i
dare
say
i
shall
think
dick
burden
a
delightful
chap
when
i
know
him
better
at
present
it
all
i
can
do
to
put
up
with
him
for
the
sake
of
his
aunt
and
the
fellow
has
such
an
ostentatiously
frank
way
of
looking
one
straight
in
the
eyes
that
i
hanged
if
i
trust
him
to
go
as
straight
talking
of
going
straight
morning
early
we
leave
for
salisbury
and
when
we
feel
like
moving
shall
pass
on
toward
the
new
forest
ever
yours
pen
xi
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
hart
hotel
dearest
i
am
particularly
homesick
for
you
because
it
my
birthday
eve
but
passing
for
nineteen
and
is
it
annoying
i
went
and
blurted
out
in
winchester
two
days
ago
that
i
had
a
birthday
hanging
over
me
i
awfully
afraid
sir
lionel
thinks
himself
bound
to
give
me
a
present
if
he
does
and
i
ca
get
out
of
taking
it
i
shall
have
to
pass
it
on
to
ellaline
of
course
when
i
passing
everything
else
on
including
myself
i
know
you
thinking
of
me
as
you
walk
after
dinner
under
the
glorious
chestnut
trees
you
describe
in
the
park
at
i
wish
you
had
an
astral
body
it
would
take
up
any
room
or
have
to
pay
railway
fares
or
wait
for
invitations
to
visit
and
it
could
easily
be
one
of
the
party
in
sir
lionel
car
so
nice
to
have
it
sitting
between
me
and
dick
burden
i
wanted
you
dreadfully
at
winchester
as
i
wrote
you
in
the
note
i
scribbled
after
seeing
the
cathedral
i
wish
i
told
you
more
about
winchester
then
for
now
it
too
late
all
stonehenge
is
lying
on
top
of
my
winchester
impressions
and
it
will
take
them
a
little
time
to
squeeze
from
underneath
they
will
come
out
though
i
know
none
the
worse
for
wear
and
how
i
shall
talk
this
trip
over
with
you
when
together
again
and
i
know
the
end
that
hiding
behind
the
of
the
future
mother
dear
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
see
barrows
billowing
prehistorically
along
the
horizon
and
i
see
stonehenge
black
against
a
red
sunset
and
silver
in
the
moonlight
also
i
have
begun
to
architecturally
i
find
through
seeing
so
much
architecture
and
trying
to
talk
about
it
intelligently
as
senter
contrives
to
do
i
believe
she
fags
it
up
at
night
with
a
wet
towel
over
her
hair
wavers
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
think
architecturally
well
for
me
not
apropos
of
at
all
a
woman
is
well
restored
or
repaired
an
man
with
a
fine
head
has
norman
bumps
and
gothic
ears
a
puppy
with
big
feet
is
an
early
with
norman
foundations
and
so
on
it
gives
a
new
interest
to
life
and
the
creatures
we
meet
emily
is
late
georgian
with
victorian
elevations
i
hated
leaving
winchester
but
oh
those
barrows
we
saw
when
we
were
coming
away
they
made
most
antique
things
seem
as
new
as
a
china
cup
with
for
a
good
girl
outlined
on
it
in
gold
letters
so
many
stupendous
events
have
scattered
themselves
along
this
road
of
ours
as
the
centuries
rolled
that
it
makes
the
brain
reel
trying
to
gather
them
up
and
sort
them
into
some
kind
of
sequence
often
i
wish
i
could
sit
and
admire
calmly
as
senter
can
and
not
get
boiling
with
excitement
over
the
past
but
one
is
so
uncomfortably
intelligent
one
ca
stop
thinking
thinking
every
minute
every
tiny
thing
i
see
has
its
little
thought
sting
ready
like
a
mosquito
and
a
fancy
that
has
lately
stabbed
me
is
the
striking
resemblance
between
english
scenery
or
its
features
and
english
character
the
best
bits
in
both
are
shy
of
showing
themselves
and
never
flaunt
they
are
so
reserved
that
to
find
them
out
you
must
search
all
the
loveliest
nooks
in
english
country
and
in
english
souls
are
hidden
from
strangers
why
the
very
cottages
try
to
hide
under
veils
of
clematis
and
roses
as
the
cottage
children
hide
their
thoughts
behind
long
eyelashes
we
came
to
salisbury
by
way
of
romsey
and
got
out
to
see
the
splendid
old
church
which
almost
ranks
with
winchester
cathedral
as
a
monument
of
england
and
romsey
abbey
too
very
beautiful
even
thrilling
still
more
ancient
hursley
with
its
earthworks
about
which
for
once
sir
lionel
and
dick
burden
were
congenial
of
course
men
who
have
been
soldiers
like
sir
lionel
or
tried
to
be
soldiers
and
could
like
dick
must
know
something
about
the
formation
of
such
things
but
anyone
may
be
interested
except
a
norton
you
and
i
had
no
motoring
when
we
were
travellers
so
we
did
see
europe
as
i
am
seeing
england
still
i
do
believe
any
other
country
has
this
individuality
of
vast
billowing
downs
as
you
bowl
smoothly
from
one
to
another
over
perfect
roads
you
have
a
series
of
surprises
new
beauties
opening
suddenly
to
your
eyes
it
is
exciting
yet
soothing
and
that
mingling
of
emotions
is
part
of
the
joy
of
the
car
for
motorists
the
downs
of
hampshire
and
wiltshire
are
like
a
beautiful
breasts
and
nature
is
a
goddess
is
she
the
greatest
of
all
combining
all
their
best
qualities
this
white
hart
is
a
nice
hotel
but
i
rather
resent
the
foreign
waiters
as
out
of
the
picture
in
such
an
essentially
english
place
i
like
the
animal
names
of
the
hotels
in
england
already
we
have
seen
a
lot
and
they
form
into
a
quaint
colourful
noah
ark
and
heraldic
procession
across
the
country
the
black
bull
the
golden
unicorn
the
blue
boar
the
red
lion
the
piebald
horse
the
green
dragon
the
white
hart
i
am
still
longing
for
a
purple
bear
the
first
thing
we
did
after
getting
settled
which
i
always
like
as
i
have
enough
luggage
to
make
much
bother
was
to
walk
out
and
see
the
town
i
kept
dick
with
me
not
because
i
wanted
him
you
may
be
sure
but
because
i
can
see
he
is
a
blot
on
the
for
sir
lionel
and
i
feel
so
guilty
having
forced
him
into
the
party
that
i
try
to
attract
the
blot
to
myself
if
i
mention
the
blot
in
future
you
know
what
it
is
when
i
very
desperate
i
may
just
fling
a
drop
of
ink
on
the
paper
to
relieve
my
feelings
and
that
will
mean
the
same
thing
the
blot
puts
on
an
air
of
the
most
exaggerated
respect
for
sir
lionel
you
fancy
he
was
talking
to
a
centenarian
horrid
pert
little
pig
i
think
pigs
run
in
their
family
i
know
he
does
it
on
purpose
to
be
nasty
and
make
sir
lionel
feel
an
old
stager
do
you
remember
the
in
alice
adventures
he
only
does
it
to
annoy
because
he
knows
it
teases
not
that
it
need
for
sir
lionel
looks
about
nobody
would
give
him
forty
unless
they
saw
it
in
books
and
he
is
like
a
knight
of
romance
there
now
you
have
the
opinion
i
have
come
to
hold
of
ellaline
dragon
for
me
the
dragon
has
turned
into
a
knight
but
of
course
i
may
be
mistaken
senter
says
that
no
girl
can
ever
possibly
understand
a
man
and
that
a
man
is
really
much
more
complicated
than
a
woman
though
the
novelists
tell
you
it
the
other
way
round
we
started
out
all
of
us
except
emily
who
lies
down
after
tea
to
walk
to
john
halle
hall
a
most
interesting
banqueting
room
which
is
now
a
but
was
built
by
a
rich
such
a
nice
word
in
as
you
can
see
on
the
oak
carvings
but
there
was
so
much
to
do
on
the
way
that
we
saw
the
hall
and
the
old
george
inn
where
pepys
lay
in
a
silk
bed
and
had
very
good
diet
last
of
all
the
antique
furniture
shops
were
simply
enthralling
and
i
wanted
nearly
everything
i
saw
travelling
is
good
for
the
mind
but
it
develops
one
or
two
of
the
worst
passions
such
as
greed
of
possession
we
went
into
several
shops
and
i
could
have
purred
with
joy
when
sir
lionel
asked
me
to
help
him
choose
several
things
for
graylees
which
he
would
have
sent
on
there
direct
he
seemed
to
care
more
for
my
advice
than
for
senter
and
i
do
think
she
quite
liked
that
for
she
really
knows
a
good
deal
about
old
english
furniture
whereas
i
know
nothing
only
a
little
about
french
and
italian
things
the
streets
of
salisbury
with
their
mediæval
houses
look
exactly
as
if
they
had
been
originally
planned
to
give
the
most
delightful
effects
possible
when
their
pictures
were
taken
every
corner
is
a
gem
and
sir
lionel
told
us
that
the
old
rectangular
part
of
the
town
planned
more
or
less
at
one
time
of
course
the
people
who
did
the
planning
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
it
all
over
before
moving
down
from
old
sarum
which
was
so
high
and
bleak
they
could
hear
the
priest
saying
mass
in
the
cathedral
because
of
the
wind
fancy
salisbury
used
to
be
called
the
venice
of
england
but
i
must
say
if
one
can
judge
now
the
simile
was
lots
of
martyrs
were
burnt
in
salisbury
it
seems
when
that
sort
of
thing
was
in
fashion
so
no
wonder
they
have
to
keep
bloody
queen
chair
in
winchester
instead
of
salisbury
where
they
a
right
to
feel
a
grudge
against
the
wretched
little
bilious
bigot
of
a
lovesick
woman
sir
lionel
has
several
martyrs
on
his
family
tree
norton
says
and
she
is
as
proud
of
them
as
most
people
are
of
royal
i
never
thought
martyrs
particularly
interesting
myself
though
perhaps
that
an
uneasy
jealousy
as
we
none
in
our
family
that
i
know
of
only
a
witch
or
so
on
father
side
poor
dears
what
a
pity
they
could
have
waited
till
now
to
be
born
when
instead
of
burning
or
drowning
them
people
would
have
paid
them
to
tell
nice
things
about
the
past
and
predict
lovers
for
the
future
witches
were
fascinating
but
many
martyrs
probably
marted
out
of
sheer
obstinacy
do
you
think
of
course
it
was
different
when
they
executed
you
without
giving
you
a
chance
to
recant
as
they
did
with
political
prisoners
and
do
you
know
they
cut
off
poor
witty
buckingham
head
in
salisbury
so
much
for
buckingham
where
it
came
off
there
an
inn
now
called
the
saracen
head
i
wonder
if
was
chopped
off
in
the
neighbourhood
too
or
if
only
a
pleasant
fancy
to
cover
up
the
buckingham
stain
in
the
yard
anyhow
they
tell
you
there
that
in
buckingham
skeleton
was
dug
up
under
the
kitchen
of
what
used
to
be
the
blue
boar
inn
but
even
that
is
as
ghastly
a
tale
as
another
one
of
salisbury
how
one
of
jack
cade
quarters
was
sent
to
the
town
when
he
been
executed
i
should
have
liked
to
know
if
it
still
to
be
seen
but
i
thought
it
would
be
hardly
nice
to
ask
we
saved
the
cathedral
for
the
last
and
just
as
we
were
in
the
midst
of
there
it
was
time
for
service
so
we
sat
down
and
listened
to
music
which
seemed
to
fall
from
heaven
there
nothing
more
glorious
than
music
in
a
cathedral
is
there
usually
it
makes
me
feel
good
but
this
time
it
made
me
feel
so
sinful
on
account
of
ellaline
and
sir
lionel
and
dick
that
i
almost
cried
do
you
think
dear
that
if
i
were
in
a
novel
they
would
have
me
for
a
heroine
or
a
wicked
adventuress
i
hae
me
doots
but
my
one
hope
is
that
you
ca
be
an
adventuress
if
you
really
mean
well
at
heart
and
are
under
maybe
i
expected
too
much
of
salisbury
cathedral
because
i
always
heard
more
about
it
than
others
in
england
but
it
was
quite
so
glorious
to
me
as
winchester
it
far
more
harmonious
because
it
was
planned
all
at
one
time
like
the
town
and
there
singularly
little
foreign
influence
to
be
traced
in
the
architecture
which
makes
it
different
from
most
others
and
extraordinarily
interesting
in
its
way
it
very
very
old
too
but
it
is
so
white
and
clean
that
it
looks
new
and
one
great
beauty
it
has
its
whiteness
seems
always
flooded
with
moonlight
even
when
sunshine
is
streaming
over
the
noble
pillars
and
lovely
tombs
this
morning
i
went
back
with
emily
to
service
and
wandered
from
chapel
to
chapel
till
nearly
luncheon
time
then
sir
lionel
came
and
took
me
up
strange
hidden
winding
stairs
to
the
den
of
the
librarian
it
was
like
stealing
into
an
enchanted
castle
where
all
save
the
librarian
slept
and
had
slept
for
centuries
when
it
was
time
to
go
away
i
was
afraid
that
sir
lionel
might
have
forgotten
the
magic
spell
which
would
open
the
door
and
let
us
escape
there
were
interesting
things
there
but
we
were
allowed
to
look
at
the
ones
we
wanted
to
see
most
till
we
were
too
tired
to
enjoy
them
after
seeing
the
ones
we
did
want
to
see
at
all
but
you
know
in
another
enchanted
castle
that
of
the
sleeping
beauty
there
was
only
lovely
princess
and
goodness
knows
how
many
snorey
bores
at
three
we
started
to
motor
out
to
stonehenge
and
sir
lionel
chose
to
be
late
because
he
wanted
to
be
there
at
sunset
which
he
knew
from
memory
to
be
the
most
thrilling
picture
for
us
to
carry
away
in
our
heads
nobody
ever
told
me
what
an
imposing
sight
old
sarum
remains
to
this
day
so
i
was
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
giant
conical
knoll
standing
up
out
of
the
plain
and
its
own
intrenchments
i
just
been
reading
about
it
in
the
how
important
it
used
to
be
to
england
when
it
was
still
a
city
and
how
it
was
a
fortress
of
the
celts
when
the
romans
came
and
snatched
it
from
them
but
i
had
no
idea
of
its
appearance
i
would
have
liked
to
go
with
sir
lionel
to
walk
round
the
intrenchments
but
he
asked
only
dick
however
senter
volunteered
to
go
at
the
last
moment
just
as
they
were
starting
and
emily
and
i
were
left
flotsam
and
jetsam
in
the
car
to
wait
till
they
came
back
i
was
bored
however
because
emily
read
a
religious
novel
by
marie
corelli
and
did
worry
to
talk
so
i
could
sit
in
peace
seeing
with
my
mind
eye
the
pageant
of
william
the
conqueror
reviewing
his
troops
in
the
plain
over
which
old
sarum
gloomily
towers
such
a
lurid
plain
it
is
this
month
of
poppies
red
as
if
its
arid
slopes
were
stained
with
the
blood
of
ghostly
armies
slain
in
battle
but
it
was
going
back
further
into
history
to
come
to
amesbury
you
know
dear
queen
guinevere
amesbury
where
she
repented
in
the
nunnery
she
founded
and
the
little
novice
sang
to
her
too
late
too
late
when
she
was
buried
king
arthur
had
a
hundred
torches
ever
burning
about
the
corpse
of
the
queen
ca
you
see
the
beautiful
picture
and
when
her
nunnery
was
gone
in
another
queen
far
far
more
wicked
than
guinevere
built
on
the
same
spot
a
convent
to
expiate
the
murder
of
her
stepson
at
corfe
castle
we
are
going
to
corfe
by
and
by
so
i
shall
send
my
thoughts
back
to
amesbury
from
there
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
elfreda
nuns
became
so
naughty
they
had
to
be
banished
nor
shall
i
forget
a
lover
who
loved
at
amesbury
sir
george
rodney
who
adored
the
fascinating
countess
of
hertford
so
desperately
that
after
her
marriage
he
composed
some
verses
in
her
honour
and
fell
then
upon
his
sword
why
do
men
do
such
things
for
us
nowadays
were
the
dear
dead
women
so
much
more
desirable
than
we
was
amesbury
a
beautiful
leading
up
to
stonehenge
it
quite
near
you
know
it
does
seem
as
if
anything
ought
to
be
near
but
a
good
many
things
are
such
as
farms
yet
they
do
spoil
it
you
never
even
think
of
them
or
of
anything
except
stonehenge
itself
once
you
have
seen
the
first
great
dark
finger
of
stone
pointing
mysteriously
skyward
out
of
the
vast
plain
that
is
the
way
stonehenge
breaks
on
you
suddenly
startlingly
like
a
cry
in
the
night
i
was
very
glad
we
had
the
luck
to
arrive
alone
for
not
long
after
entered
the
charmed
magic
circle
of
the
giant
plinths
a
procession
of
other
poured
up
to
the
gates
droves
of
chauffeurs
and
bevies
of
pretty
ladies
in
motor
hats
swarmed
like
living
anachronisms
among
the
monuments
of
the
past
of
course
did
seem
to
ourselves
to
be
anachronisms
because
what
is
horrid
in
other
people
is
always
quite
different
and
excusable
or
even
piquant
in
oneself
and
i
hastily
argued
that
motor
apollo
the
sun
god
was
really
appropriate
in
this
place
of
fire
worship
even
the
druids
could
have
objected
to
although
they
would
probably
have
sacrificed
all
of
in
a
bunch
unless
we
could
have
hastily
proved
that
we
were
a
new
kind
of
god
and
goddess
driving
chariots
of
fire
anyhow
are
making
history
just
as
much
as
the
druids
did
so
they
ought
to
be
welcome
anywhere
in
any
scene
and
they
seem
to
have
more
right
to
be
at
stonehenge
than
patronizing
little
pepys
you
remember
rolde
in
holland
do
you
with
its
miniature
stonehenge
well
it
might
have
been
made
for
druids
children
to
play
dolls
with
compared
to
this
if
the
phoenicians
raised
stonehenge
in
worship
of
their
fiery
god
they
had
good
reason
to
flatter
themselves
that
it
would
attract
his
attention
and
i
do
think
it
was
sensible
to
choose
the
sun
for
a
god
next
to
our
own
true
religion
that
seems
the
most
comforting
there
was
your
deity
in
full
sight
looking
after
one
side
or
the
other
of
his
world
all
through
the
hours
i
never
felt
more
than
i
did
passing
under
the
shadow
of
those
great
sentinel
plinths
guarding
their
sunken
altar
hiding
their
own
impenetrable
mysteries
the
winds
seemed
to
blow
more
chill
and
to
whisper
strangely
as
if
trying
to
tell
secrets
we
could
never
understand
i
love
the
legend
of
the
friar
heel
but
after
all
only
a
mediæval
legend
and
it
more
interesting
to
think
that
from
the
middle
of
the
sacrificial
altar
the
priest
could
see
the
sun
rise
at
the
summer
solstice
just
above
that
stupendous
stone
i
stood
there
imagining
a
druid
looking
up
his
knife
suspended
over
a
fair
girl
victim
waiting
to
strike
until
his
eye
should
meet
the
red
eye
of
the
sun
oh
i
shall
have
bad
dreams
about
stonehenge
i
know
but
i
sha
mind
if
i
can
dream
about
the
duke
of
buckingham
digging
for
treasure
there
at
midnight
and
if
i
were
like
du
dear
peter
ibbetson
i
could
dream
back
and
see
at
what
far
distance
the
builders
of
stonehenge
got
their
mysterious
syenite
and
that
one
black
sandstone
so
different
from
the
rest
i
could
dream
who
were
the
builders
whether
phoenicians
or
mourning
britons
of
arthur
day
as
geoffrey
of
monmouth
tells
sir
lionel
and
i
like
to
think
it
was
the
britons
for
that
gives
him
a
family
feeling
for
the
place
since
he
read
out
of
a
book
sonnet
thou
noblest
monument
of
albion
isle
whether
by
merlin
aid
from
scythia
shore
to
amber
fatal
plain
pendragon
bore
huge
frame
of
giants
hands
the
mighty
pile
to
entomb
his
britons
slain
by
hengist
guile
or
druid
priests
sprinkled
with
human
gore
taught
the
massy
maze
their
mystic
lore
next
time
i
want
to
see
stonehenge
from
an
airship
or
at
a
pinch
a
balloon
because
i
can
judge
better
of
the
original
form
the
two
circles
and
the
two
ellipses
which
the
handsomest
policeman
i
ever
saw
out
of
a
christmas
annual
explained
to
me
pacing
the
rough
grass
he
lives
at
stonehenge
all
day
with
a
dog
and
they
are
both
guardians
i
asked
him
if
he
had
not
beautiful
thoughts
but
he
said
not
in
winter
miss
it
was
too
cold
to
think
then
except
about
hot
soup
stonehenge
is
very
becoming
to
this
young
man
especially
at
sunset
and
dearest
you
can
hardly
imagine
the
glory
of
those
piled
stones
as
you
look
back
at
them
going
slowly
slowly
away
and
seeing
them
against
a
crimson
streak
of
sunset
like
a
smoking
torch
illustration
policeman
explained
to
we
got
lost
trying
to
find
the
river
road
going
home
and
had
great
fun
straying
into
meadows
and
onto
ploughed
ground
which
poor
apollo
resented
the
way
was
beautiful
past
some
lovely
old
houses
and
exquisite
cottages
and
the
avon
was
idyllic
in
its
pretty
windings
but
the
villages
of
wiltshire
i
do
find
as
poetical
as
those
in
surrey
and
sussex
or
hampshire
you
would
never
guess
what
i
going
to
do
morning
i
not
sure
you
let
me
if
you
knew
but
a
ward
does
need
a
chaperon
with
a
guardian
he
plays
both
parts
i
to
get
up
early
before
the
sun
is
awake
and
sir
lionel
is
to
motor
me
out
to
stonehenge
so
that
i
can
see
it
by
sunrise
as
well
as
sunset
it
is
a
beautiful
idea
and
the
handsome
policeman
has
promised
to
be
there
and
let
us
in
seeing
a
sunrise
is
like
a
glorified
private
view
i
think
i
expect
to
feel
as
louis
of
bavaria
must
have
felt
when
he
had
a
wagner
opera
all
to
himself
now
i
am
going
down
to
post
this
so
that
it
can
leave
for
london
by
the
last
train
and
start
for
switzerland
in
the
morning
of
my
birthday
i
shall
count
the
sunrise
a
birthday
present
from
heaven
if
it
fine
and
if
it
is
i
shall
know
what
i
suspect
already
that
i
do
deserve
one
your
loving
changeling
audrie
xii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
arms
stony
cross
new
little
it
very
late
or
early
but
i
did
want
to
write
you
on
my
birthday
and
besides
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
tell
you
about
the
fairylike
experience
i
have
had
i
am
in
fairyland
even
here
and
now
but
i
have
been
to
the
heart
of
it
i
shall
never
forget
oh
but
first
the
sunrise
my
birthday
sunrise
it
was
wonderful
and
made
me
think
how
much
time
i
have
wasted
hardly
ever
accepting
its
invitations
i
believe
i
will
turn
over
a
new
leaf
i
shall
get
up
very
very
early
every
day
and
go
to
bed
very
very
late
so
as
to
squeeze
all
the
juice
out
of
the
orange
and
wring
every
minute
out
of
my
youth
i
feel
so
alive
i
do
want
to
lose
the
morning
glory
when
i
old
i
shall
do
differently
i
go
to
bed
directly
after
dinner
and
sleep
late
so
that
age
may
be
short
following
a
long
youth
is
that
a
good
plan
to
make
on
my
birthday
sir
lionel
had
forgotten
and
wished
me
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
but
he
did
give
me
a
present
so
i
hoped
he
had
changed
his
mind
we
got
back
to
salisbury
about
the
time
norton
and
senter
were
having
their
breakfasts
in
bed
they
had
heard
of
our
expedition
and
the
word
had
gone
out
that
we
were
to
start
for
the
new
forest
till
after
luncheon
as
it
would
be
a
short
run
and
we
had
nearly
finished
our
tea
toast
and
eggs
when
dick
strolled
into
the
he
seemed
decidedly
at
sight
of
us
together
at
a
little
table
talking
cozily
and
that
detective
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
cats
have
when
a
mouse
occurs
to
them
he
laughed
merrily
though
and
chaffed
us
on
making
secret
plans
dick
has
a
very
nice
laugh
it
too
explosive
and
loud
do
you
think
other
animals
must
consider
the
laughter
of
humans
an
odd
noise
without
rhyme
or
reason
also
dick
has
a
nasty
way
of
saying
thank
you
to
a
waiter
with
the
rising
inflection
you
know
which
is
nicely
calculated
to
make
the
servant
feel
himself
the
last
of
god
creatures
by
two
we
had
said
to
salisbury
for
me
au
revoir
for
the
others
perhaps
and
were
kinematographing
in
and
out
of
charming
scenery
lovelier
perhaps
than
any
we
seen
yet
under
green
gloom
of
forests
where
it
seemed
a
prisoned
dryad
might
be
napping
in
each
tree
and
where
only
a
faun
could
have
been
a
suitable
chauffeur
past
heatherland
just
lit
to
rosy
fire
by
the
sun
blaze
through
billowy
country
where
grain
was
gold
and
silver
meadows
were
flawed
emeralds
set
in
copper
and
here
and
there
a
huge
dark
blot
meant
a
prehistoric
barrow
the
car
played
us
a
trick
for
the
first
time
and
young
nick
looking
more
like
buddha
than
ever
got
down
to
have
a
talk
with
the
motor
i
think
apollo
had
swallowed
a
crumb
or
something
for
he
coughed
and
wheezed
and
would
move
except
with
gasps
until
he
had
been
patted
under
the
bonnet
and
tickled
with
all
sorts
of
funny
instruments
such
as
a
giant
dentist
might
use
it
was
fun
though
for
us
irresponsible
ones
while
sir
lionel
and
nick
tried
different
things
to
get
the
crumb
out
of
apollo
throat
other
motorists
flew
by
scornfully
like
the
priest
and
the
levite
or
slowed
up
to
ask
if
they
could
help
and
looked
with
some
interest
at
senter
and
me
sitting
there
like
mantelpiece
ornaments
i
did
even
want
to
slaughter
them
for
the
dust
they
made
now
that
i
a
real
motorist
myself
for
dog
can
not
eat
dog
and
even
cyclists
seemed
like
our
poor
relations
one
elderly
woman
bumped
by
sitting
in
a
kind
of
dreadful
bath
chair
fastened
in
front
of
a
motor
bicycle
spattering
noise
and
petrol
you
could
see
her
features
under
her
expression
which
was
agonized
the
young
man
who
propelled
her
was
smirking
conceitedly
as
if
to
say
what
a
kind
chap
i
am
giving
my
maiden
aunt
a
good
time
presently
a
small
car
came
limping
along
that
had
we
know
it
printed
in
large
rough
letters
on
a
card
tied
to
a
broken
wheel
was
that
a
good
idea
when
they
got
nervous
prostration
having
everybody
tell
them
cows
paused
gazed
at
us
and
sneered
but
at
last
apollo
crumb
was
extracted
young
nick
brushed
the
dust
off
his
sleeves
by
rubbing
his
arms
together
the
way
flies
clean
their
antennæ
and
we
were
ready
to
go
on
it
a
wise
car
that
knows
its
own
chauffeur
said
senter
just
because
this
happened
and
because
a
tire
presently
burst
in
sheer
sympathy
we
travelled
in
the
beginning
of
sunset
which
was
divine
the
scene
swam
in
light
so
pink
it
seemed
as
if
you
could
bottle
it
and
it
would
still
be
pink
the
tree
trunks
were
cased
in
ruddy
gold
like
the
gold
leaf
wrapped
round
royal
mummies
making
up
for
lost
time
the
white
road
smoked
beneath
our
tires
and
we
were
soon
in
the
new
forest
the
old
old
new
forest
perfumed
like
the
of
heaven
we
came
to
this
pretty
little
hotel
in
the
midst
of
heathery
spaces
like
a
cutting
in
the
aromatic
forest
i
like
my
room
but
i
did
want
to
stop
in
it
and
begin
dressing
for
dinner
looking
out
of
my
window
i
saw
a
little
white
moon
curved
like
a
baby
arm
cushioned
among
banks
of
sky
azaleas
so
i
felt
i
must
go
out
and
drink
the
sunset
i
had
left
too
much
of
that
wine
in
the
bottom
of
the
silver
goblet
i
must
have
the
last
drop
so
i
ran
downstairs
and
i
warn
you
now
comes
the
experience
which
i
liked
so
much
but
of
which
you
wo
approve
the
landlord
stood
in
the
hall
and
i
asked
him
if
there
were
anything
wonderful
i
could
go
and
see
in
a
few
minutes
he
smiled
and
said
it
would
take
me
very
long
to
find
rufus
stone
but
he
would
not
advise
me
to
do
it
i
replied
that
i
would
ask
him
to
advise
if
point
out
the
road
and
probably
i
should
only
venture
a
little
way
he
was
a
nice
man
so
he
went
out
in
front
of
the
hotel
to
point
and
lent
me
a
puppy
as
a
companion
the
puppy
was
no
respecter
of
persons
all
he
cared
for
was
a
walk
so
he
kindly
consented
to
take
me
with
him
gambolling
ahead
as
if
he
knew
where
i
wanted
to
go
that
tempted
me
on
and
the
way
was
hard
to
find
for
the
puppy
or
for
me
we
played
into
each
other
paws
and
when
i
was
lost
he
found
me
or
vice
versa
the
first
thing
i
knew
there
was
the
stone
nobody
could
mistake
it
even
from
a
distance
and
going
down
to
it
from
the
top
of
a
hill
it
was
still
light
enough
to
read
the
inscription
this
was
my
first
entrance
into
the
heart
of
fairyland
william
rufus
could
have
chosen
a
more
ideal
spot
to
die
in
if
picked
it
out
himself
from
a
list
of
a
hundred
others
and
the
evening
silence
under
the
great
gray
beeches
seemed
as
if
it
had
lasted
a
thousand
years
always
the
same
old
and
wise
as
mother
earth
then
suddenly
it
was
broken
by
the
rustle
and
stir
of
a
cock
pheasant
which
appeared
from
somewhere
as
if
by
magic
and
stood
for
an
instant
all
kingly
his
breast
blazing
with
jewelled
orders
in
the
sunset
me
he
regarded
with
the
haughty
defiance
of
a
norman
prince
and
screamed
with
rage
at
the
puppy
all
his
theories
upset
because
he
had
been
so
positive
the
world
was
entirely
his
so
it
was
if
he
only
stopped
to
let
me
assure
him
that
he
owned
all
the
best
things
in
it
but
he
whirred
and
soared
and
thus
i
realized
instantly
that
he
was
a
fairy
in
disguise
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
guessed
while
he
was
there
illustration
rufus
could
have
chosen
a
more
ideal
spot
to
die
you
know
the
new
forest
is
haunted
with
fairies
good
and
bad
there
are
the
malfays
that
came
because
of
william
the
conqueror
cruelty
in
driving
away
the
peasants
to
make
the
great
for
his
hunting
and
there
are
the
good
fays
that
help
the
cottage
housewives
and
the
tricksies
that
frighten
the
wild
ponies
and
pinch
the
cattle
i
would
have
been
surprised
to
learn
that
that
pheasant
was
puck
himself
for
no
doubt
puck
has
a
somewhere
in
the
new
forest
i
meant
to
sit
by
the
stone
only
five
minutes
but
the
fairies
put
a
spell
upon
my
five
minutes
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
the
sun
was
gone
so
was
the
puppy
which
was
even
more
serious
for
i
was
handicapped
by
not
knowing
his
name
and
no
canine
thing
would
respond
to
shouts
of
dog
or
here
pup
pup
pup
however
i
tried
both
running
about
to
look
for
him
here
and
there
among
the
enchanted
bracken
that
rustled
with
while
the
shadows
came
alive
and
the
rosy
light
died
puppy
puppy
i
implored
helplessly
drifting
and
then
to
my
surprise
can
you
find
that
you
lost
a
thing
well
i
do
know
how
else
to
express
it
i
found
that
i
lost
the
path
if
i
only
been
able
to
remember
whether
the
hotel
were
north
or
south
or
east
or
west
of
rufus
stone
maybe
it
would
have
been
all
right
but
does
any
normal
girl
ever
give
thought
to
points
of
the
compass
i
yelled
a
little
more
hoping
the
puppy
would
be
gentleman
enough
to
come
back
to
a
lady
in
distress
and
luckily
sir
lionel
heard
my
howls
he
come
out
to
look
for
me
on
learning
from
the
landlord
that
i
gone
to
stone
with
the
puppy
and
he
had
met
it
not
the
stone
but
the
puppy
looking
sneaky
and
ashamed
just
then
my
voice
gave
him
an
idea
of
my
whereabouts
otherwise
we
should
probably
have
missed
and
if
we
had
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
so
you
must
scold
at
what
happened
next
remember
the
new
forest
is
not
a
french
pension
full
of
old
maids
but
fairyland
fairyland
he
was
in
evening
dress
without
a
hat
and
i
pleased
to
see
him
because
i
was
beginning
to
be
the
tiniest
bit
afraid
and
he
did
look
so
nice
and
i
was
glad
he
was
dick
burden
but
do
worry
i
did
tell
him
that
it
seems
he
came
downstairs
rather
early
for
dinner
and
the
landlord
mentioned
that
i
gone
out
so
he
strolled
along
thinking
to
meet
me
after
walking
a
few
yards
when
he
did
he
thought
he
better
keep
on
because
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
be
out
of
doors
alone
i
was
apologetic
and
afraid
it
must
be
long
past
but
he
said
i
need
mind
that
as
he
had
left
word
for
the
others
not
to
wait
after
then
in
a
few
minutes
i
began
to
realize
that
we
might
have
an
adventure
because
when
i
called
and
sir
lionel
hurried
on
in
quest
of
me
he
forgotten
to
notice
the
landmarks
it
did
seem
ridiculous
to
have
trouble
in
finding
the
way
so
short
a
distance
from
the
hotel
but
you
ca
conceive
how
misleading
it
is
in
the
new
forest
it
like
a
part
of
the
enchantment
and
if
we
had
been
in
the
maze
of
the
minotaur
without
ariadne
clue
we
could
have
been
more
bewildered
than
we
soon
found
ourselves
tangled
in
the
veil
of
twilight
i
wonder
if
birds
will
cover
us
with
leaves
i
said
laughing
when
we
had
made
up
our
minds
that
we
were
lost
but
it
seemed
more
likely
that
if
any
creature
paid
us
this
thoughtful
attention
it
would
be
bats
as
night
fell
in
the
forest
they
unhooked
themselves
from
their
mysterious
trapezes
and
whirred
past
our
faces
with
a
soft
flap
flap
of
velvet
wings
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
one
had
made
a
of
my
hair
are
you
hungry
sir
lionel
wanted
to
know
i
said
that
i
was
but
would
harrow
him
up
by
explaining
that
i
was
ravenous
he
did
appear
even
to
to
scold
though
it
would
have
been
easy
to
hint
politely
that
it
would
be
my
own
fault
if
we
did
get
any
dinner
that
night
or
perhaps
breakfast
next
morning
instead
of
being
cross
with
me
he
blamed
himself
for
being
stupid
enough
to
lose
me
i
exonerated
him
and
we
were
extremely
nice
to
each
other
but
as
we
walked
on
and
on
round
and
round
seeing
no
lights
anywhere
or
hearing
anything
except
that
wonderful
sound
of
a
great
silence
i
began
to
grow
tired
i
did
mean
though
that
he
should
see
it
had
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
without
that
but
he
knew
by
instinct
and
took
my
hand
to
draw
it
through
his
arm
telling
me
to
lean
as
heavily
as
i
liked
i
held
back
at
first
saying
it
was
necessary
and
insisting
as
i
pulled
away
his
hand
closed
down
on
mine
tightly
it
was
only
for
a
second
or
two
because
i
gave
up
at
once
and
let
him
lay
my
hand
on
his
arm
as
he
wished
but
do
you
know
mother
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
it
felt
quite
differently
from
any
other
hand
that
ever
touched
mine
of
course
i
have
even
shaken
hands
with
many
men
since
i
been
grown
up
though
if
you
let
me
be
a
singer
i
should
have
thought
any
more
about
it
than
if
i
were
president
of
the
united
states
one
reads
in
novels
of
the
electricity
in
a
touch
and
all
that
but
there
it
generally
means
that
you
falling
in
love
and
i
possibly
be
falling
in
love
with
ellaline
dragon
can
i
i
suppose
that
can
be
it
would
be
too
stupid
and
forward
and
altogether
unspeakable
but
really
i
do
feel
differently
about
him
from
any
way
i
ever
felt
before
toward
anybody
i
have
always
said
that
i
rather
be
alone
with
myself
than
with
anyone
else
except
you
for
any
length
of
time
because
i
such
good
chums
with
myself
and
enjoy
thinking
my
own
thoughts
but
i
like
being
with
sir
lionel
i
feel
excited
and
eager
at
the
thought
of
being
with
him
and
his
fingers
on
mine
and
my
hand
on
his
arm
and
the
touch
of
his
sleeve
and
a
faint
little
almost
imperceptible
scent
of
egyptian
cigarettes
mixing
with
the
woodsy
smell
of
the
night
oh
i
do
know
how
to
describe
it
to
myself
so
now
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
but
would
it
be
dreadful
if
i
should
go
and
fall
in
love
with
sir
lionel
pendragon
of
all
other
men
in
the
world
in
a
few
more
weeks
i
shall
be
slipping
out
of
his
life
forever
and
not
only
that
but
i
shall
be
leaving
a
very
evil
memory
behind
he
will
despise
me
i
shall
have
proved
myself
exactly
the
sort
of
person
he
abominates
i
did
think
all
that
however
as
he
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
i
just
felt
the
thrill
of
it
but
instead
of
worrying
i
was
happy
and
care
how
tired
and
hungry
i
was
or
whether
we
ever
got
anywhere
or
not
as
for
him
he
was
too
polite
to
let
me
know
he
was
bored
and
all
the
time
we
were
looking
for
the
hotel
the
night
was
so
beautiful
so
wonderful
that
we
could
help
talking
of
exquisite
things
telling
each
other
thoughts
neither
of
us
would
have
spoken
aloud
in
daylight
it
was
quite
dark
now
except
for
a
kind
of
rosy
quivering
of
light
along
the
horizon
and
the
stars
that
had
come
out
like
a
bright
army
of
fairies
with
millions
of
scintillating
spears
i
knew
then
dearest
that
he
was
no
dragon
no
matter
what
circumstantial
evidence
may
have
been
handed
down
to
ellaline
as
a
legacy
from
her
dead
mother
that
is
something
to
have
divined
by
the
magic
of
the
forest
is
it
after
i
been
puzzling
so
long
there
is
now
not
the
least
doubt
in
my
mind
so
if
i
should
be
silly
and
sentimental
enough
to
fancy
myself
in
love
it
ca
do
any
harm
except
to
make
me
a
little
sorry
and
sad
after
i
come
home
to
you
it
be
anything
to
be
of
to
have
cared
about
a
man
like
sir
lionel
because
i
assure
you
i
sha
behave
foolishly
no
matter
how
i
may
eventually
feel
you
can
trust
your
audrie
for
that
it
was
too
dark
to
tell
the
time
by
a
watch
but
we
remarked
to
each
other
that
they
must
have
finished
dinner
long
ago
and
sir
lionel
hoped
this
would
spoil
the
memory
of
my
birthday
for
me
oh
no
said
i
before
i
thought
it
will
make
it
better
i
shall
never
never
forget
this
nor
i
said
he
in
a
pleasant
quiet
tone
then
he
went
on
to
tell
me
that
he
had
a
little
birthday
remembrance
which
all
day
he
been
wanting
to
give
me
it
was
a
ruby
ring
because
the
ruby
was
july
stone
but
i
need
wear
it
unless
i
liked
he
hoped
i
would
mind
his
having
disobeyed
me
when
i
said
i
wanted
nothing
because
he
wished
very
much
to
give
it
to
me
and
having
lived
alone
and
ordered
his
own
and
other
people
affairs
for
so
long
had
accustomed
him
to
having
his
own
way
would
i
be
kind
to
him
and
accept
his
present
i
could
say
no
under
those
stars
and
in
that
enchantment
so
i
answered
that
i
would
take
the
ring
knowing
all
the
while
i
must
soon
hand
it
over
to
ellaline
shall
i
give
it
to
you
now
he
asked
or
will
you
wait
till
i
did
want
to
see
it
though
it
was
to
be
only
borrowed
now
said
i
then
he
took
a
ring
from
some
pocket
and
tried
to
slip
it
over
a
finger
of
the
hand
on
his
arm
oh
but
that
the
engaged
finger
i
burst
out
silly
of
me
i
might
have
let
him
put
it
on
and
changed
it
afterward
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
almost
as
if
he
were
startled
that
will
be
a
younger
man
privilege
some
day
and
then
you
will
be
taken
away
from
me
you
will
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
i
should
think
i
hurried
to
say
stretching
out
my
other
hand
and
letting
him
slip
the
ring
on
the
third
finger
should
you
think
so
he
echoed
i
suppose
you
have
the
right
to
feel
that
after
the
past
but
do
feel
it
do
child
that
was
all
and
i
did
answer
i
could
for
what
he
had
said
was
for
ellaline
not
for
me
yet
it
made
my
heart
beat
his
voice
was
so
sincere
and
fuller
of
emotion
than
i
ever
heard
it
yet
just
then
into
our
darkness
a
light
seemed
to
flash
we
both
saw
it
together
i
thought
it
might
be
the
hotel
but
sir
lionel
said
he
feared
it
was
more
probably
the
window
of
some
remote
cottage
or
hut
we
walked
toward
it
and
that
was
what
it
was
a
hut
sir
lionel
must
have
been
disappointed
because
he
wanted
to
get
me
home
but
was
i
was
in
such
a
mood
that
i
was
not
ready
for
the
adventure
to
come
to
an
end
the
next
bit
of
the
adventure
was
exactly
suited
to
the
new
forest
and
we
could
have
experienced
it
anywhere
else
the
hut
was
a
tiny
wattled
shed
and
the
light
we
seen
came
through
the
low
open
doorway
it
was
the
light
of
a
fire
and
a
candle
and
there
was
a
delicious
aromatic
smell
of
wood
smoke
in
the
air
sir
lionel
explained
as
we
walked
up
to
the
place
that
some
of
these
huts
were
hundreds
of
years
old
remnants
of
the
time
when
debtors
and
robbers
and
criminals
of
all
sorts
used
to
hide
in
the
forest
under
the
protection
of
the
malfays
as
he
spoke
we
almost
stumbled
over
some
obstacle
in
the
dark
and
he
said
that
very
likely
it
was
the
hearth
of
a
vanished
cottage
people
had
the
right
to
leave
the
hearth
if
their
house
were
torn
down
to
establish
cottage
rights
and
there
were
a
good
many
such
still
scattered
through
the
forest
even
in
the
gardens
of
modern
houses
for
no
one
dared
take
them
away
the
was
at
home
and
receiving
he
was
engaged
in
cooking
eggs
and
bacon
for
his
supper
and
if
you
could
only
guess
how
good
they
smelled
nothing
smells
as
nice
as
eggs
and
bacon
when
you
are
hungry
and
we
were
ravenous
most
things
as
old
as
that
are
in
museums
and
his
eyes
were
so
close
together
it
seemed
as
if
they
might
run
into
one
when
he
winked
also
he
was
deaf
so
we
had
to
roar
to
him
before
he
could
understand
what
had
happened
when
he
did
understand
though
he
was
a
thorough
trump
and
said
we
could
have
his
supper
if
we
would
be
pleased
to
eat
it
bread
and
cheese
would
do
for
him
and
we
might
have
tea
if
we
could
take
it
without
milk
but
there
were
three
eggs
and
three
strips
of
bacon
so
we
insisted
that
we
must
share
and
share
alike
or
we
would
have
nothing
i
made
the
tea
in
a
battered
tin
pot
which
looked
like
an
heirloom
and
we
all
sat
at
an
uncovered
kitchen
table
together
though
our
host
protested
it
was
fun
and
the
old
thing
told
us
weird
tales
of
the
forest
which
made
me
conscious
that
i
have
a
spine
and
marrow
just
as
certain
wild
music
does
his
name
is
purkess
he
thinks
he
is
descended
from
purkess
the
who
found
the
body
of
william
rufus
and
his
ancestors
some
of
whom
were
smugglers
and
poachers
have
lived
in
the
forest
for
a
thousand
years
he
was
so
old
that
he
could
remember
as
a
child
hearing
his
old
grandfather
tell
of
the
days
of
the
wicked
illegal
in
the
forest
for
the
building
of
warships
just
think
grand
oaks
ash
and
thorn
trees
stanch
as
english
hearts
sold
for
the
price
of
firewood
i
sat
at
the
table
watching
the
firelight
play
on
my
ring
which
i
had
seen
till
we
got
into
the
hut
and
it
is
beautiful
i
shall
enjoy
having
it
though
only
for
a
little
while
and
shall
regard
it
as
a
trust
for
ellaline
the
assured
us
we
need
worry
he
would
put
us
on
the
way
home
and
give
us
landmarks
which
after
he
guided
us
a
certain
distance
we
could
miss
even
at
night
when
we
finished
our
eggs
and
bacon
our
tea
and
chunks
of
dry
bread
sir
lionel
laid
a
gold
piece
on
the
table
blind
as
he
was
the
old
man
was
too
blind
to
see
and
he
simply
beamed
bless
you
all
the
days
of
your
life
sir
and
your
good
pretty
lady
he
cackled
that
the
third
time
i
been
taken
for
sir
lionel
wife
the
other
times
i
did
care
but
this
time
though
i
laughed
it
was
a
laugh
because
of
those
dim
questionings
about
myself
floating
in
the
background
of
my
mind
the
descendant
of
poachers
knew
the
forest
as
he
said
with
his
eyes
shut
he
limped
before
us
for
nearly
half
a
mile
along
what
he
called
a
walk
a
new
forest
word
and
then
abandoned
us
to
our
fate
after
describing
the
profile
of
each
important
tree
which
we
must
pass
and
pointing
out
a
few
stars
as
guides
then
we
bade
each
other
for
ever
he
went
back
to
gloat
over
his
gold
piece
and
sir
lionel
and
i
went
on
together
somehow
we
fell
to
talking
of
our
favourite
virtues
and
without
thinking
i
said
my
mother
is
gratitude
gratitude
he
repeated
as
if
in
surprise
but
he
did
seem
to
notice
that
i
used
the
present
tense
to
make
him
forget
my
slip
i
hurried
on
to
say
i
thought
mine
was
courage
in
a
man
anyhow
what
was
his
in
a
woman
truth
he
answered
with
an
instant
hesitation
luckily
he
could
see
me
blush
in
the
dark
but
the
real
audrie
was
always
decently
truthful
was
she
it
only
this
that
is
free
to
be
true
only
in
women
i
asked
uncomfortably
truth
goes
without
saying
in
men
the
sort
of
men
one
knows
said
he
do
you
think
women
love
the
truth
as
much
as
men
i
persisted
no
i
do
he
answered
abruptly
then
qualified
his
no
as
if
he
ought
to
apologize
for
it
but
i
have
had
much
experience
he
finished
a
heavy
dull
sound
coming
into
his
voice
well
dearest
that
all
i
have
to
tell
you
on
this
my
birthday
night
except
that
we
found
our
way
back
to
the
hotel
safely
arriving
about
ten
and
only
emily
was
anxious
about
us
the
other
two
were
inclined
to
be
frivolous
and
senter
noticed
the
new
ring
which
i
had
forgotten
to
take
off
my
finger
nothing
ever
escapes
her
eyes
i
saw
them
light
and
linger
but
of
course
she
did
refer
to
the
ring
and
naturally
i
did
i
had
quite
decided
whether
or
not
i
should
wear
it
for
every
day
and
had
been
inclined
to
think
it
would
be
better
not
even
at
the
risk
of
disappointing
the
giver
but
i
made
up
my
mind
when
senter
looked
so
peculiarly
at
it
that
i
would
brazen
the
thing
out
and
so
i
will
i
envy
you
your
adventure
she
said
in
what
felt
was
a
meaning
voice
though
sir
lionel
did
appear
to
read
under
the
commonplace
surface
i
do
care
if
she
does
choose
to
be
horrid
i
do
see
how
she
can
hurt
me
and
as
for
dick
he
has
done
his
worst
he
has
made
me
get
them
both
asked
for
the
tour
i
should
think
that
enough
we
are
going
to
stop
at
the
compton
arms
for
two
or
three
days
running
about
in
the
car
to
see
different
parts
of
the
forest
and
coming
home
at
night
i
love
that
way
the
only
thing
i
do
like
in
going
from
one
hotel
to
another
is
having
all
sorts
of
queer
little
birthmarks
on
my
hankies
and
other
things
in
the
angel
duck
your
daughter
only
think
i
am
now
of
age
by
the
way
sir
lionel
who
expected
his
ward
to
be
a
little
girl
thoughtless
of
him
said
you
so
old
i
ca
get
used
to
you
and
i
retorted
you
so
young
i
ca
get
used
to
i
hope
it
did
sound
pert
to
answer
like
that
xiii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
why
are
you
with
me
dearest
seeing
what
i
am
seeing
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
write
that
my
letters
make
a
panorama
pass
before
your
eyes
and
i
flattered
but
i
want
you
although
i
am
enjoying
life
i
more
excited
than
happy
and
i
do
sleep
well
i
dream
horrid
dreams
about
senter
and
dick
burden
and
about
ellaline
too
but
i
always
laugh
when
i
wake
up
thank
you
so
much
for
telling
me
that
you
think
i
behaving
pretty
well
considering
but
i
wonder
what
you
say
in
your
next
after
my
last
every
day
since
then
i
been
meaning
to
write
if
only
a
short
note
but
we
had
early
starts
and
late
stops
and
then
from
not
sleeping
at
night
i
often
so
tired
when
the
end
of
the
day
comes
that
i
feel
too
stupid
to
try
and
earn
your
compliments
it
is
morning
and
i
writing
out
of
doors
sitting
on
a
rock
close
by
the
sea
but
before
i
begin
to
describe
lulworth
i
must
tell
you
a
little
about
the
glorious
things
of
which
i
had
flying
glimpses
since
the
letter
dated
compton
arms
this
is
our
first
stopping
place
since
we
left
stony
cross
for
good
but
i
picked
up
many
a
marvellous
memory
by
the
way
people
who
have
seen
the
new
forest
have
seen
england
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
like
till
we
stayed
there
i
knew
from
that
there
were
thousands
of
acres
of
woodland
still
though
much
had
been
deforested
but
i
did
know
it
hid
many
beautiful
villages
and
even
towns
it
a
heavenly
place
for
motoring
but
not
sure
it
would
be
even
better
to
walk
because
you
could
eke
out
the
joy
of
it
longer
i
should
like
a
walking
honeymoon
a
whole
round
moon
in
the
new
forest
if
it
were
with
just
the
right
man
oh
i
must
forget
to
say
i
glad
i
did
see
rufus
stone
by
daylight
senter
and
dick
went
the
morning
after
i
wrote
to
you
but
i
would
go
again
because
i
did
want
to
lose
the
enchanted
picture
in
my
mind
she
laughed
when
i
refused
i
could
have
slapped
her
but
never
mind
when
they
came
back
they
were
disgusted
and
said
there
was
a
woman
and
a
man
with
the
game
of
aunt
sally
and
a
crowd
of
cockney
excursionists
round
them
and
the
stone
talk
of
malfays
sir
lionel
had
made
out
an
itinerary
for
the
day
and
we
were
to
start
for
lyndhurst
beaulieu
abbey
lymington
brockenhurst
and
mark
ash
all
of
which
we
were
to
visit
before
evening
coming
back
by
way
of
lyndhurst
again
and
stopping
there
for
tea
but
before
we
got
off
such
a
comic
thing
happened
i
did
think
to
mention
it
in
a
letter
but
one
day
we
passed
a
that
was
having
tire
trouble
by
the
side
of
the
road
the
chauffeur
was
rolling
on
a
new
tire
with
a
machine
in
which
young
nick
was
passionately
interested
as
he
never
seen
one
before
sir
lionel
explained
that
it
was
an
american
tool
not
very
long
invented
and
said
to
be
good
he
added
in
an
evil
moment
that
he
wished
he
thought
to
buy
one
like
it
before
leaving
london
as
probably
the
thing
could
be
got
in
the
provinces
well
just
as
we
were
about
to
spin
away
in
great
style
from
the
compton
arms
one
of
our
tires
sighed
and
settled
down
for
an
unearned
rest
but
instead
of
looking
and
murderous
as
he
did
when
the
same
thing
occurred
before
nick
smiled
gleefully
he
jumped
down
and
without
a
word
produced
a
machine
exactly
like
the
one
his
master
admired
a
few
days
ago
where
did
you
get
that
asked
sir
lionel
last
night
sahib
returned
nick
imperturbably
he
can
speak
quite
good
english
what
since
we
had
our
trouble
yes
sahib
an
odd
expression
now
began
to
play
among
nick
brown
features
like
a
breeze
over
a
field
of
growing
wheat
how
that
there
no
shop
the
sahib
says
true
i
found
this
thing
where
sharply
but
a
little
way
from
here
in
the
road
you
rascal
exclaimed
sir
lionel
you
stole
it
young
nick
made
buddha
eyebrows
and
a
buddha
gesture
the
sahib
knows
all
but
if
i
did
take
it
those
men
they
were
going
again
to
the
big
city
we
away
they
never
miss
this
they
buy
another
it
is
better
we
have
it
trying
to
look
very
angry
though
i
knew
he
was
dying
to
laugh
sir
lionel
reproached
nick
for
breaking
a
solemn
promise
you
swore
never
do
such
a
thing
in
england
if
i
brought
you
with
me
now
begun
again
the
same
old
game
i
shall
have
to
send
you
back
that
is
all
then
i
die
and
is
all
replied
young
nick
calmly
the
end
of
the
story
is
that
sir
lionel
found
out
the
names
of
the
men
who
had
spent
the
night
at
the
compton
arms
and
had
written
their
address
in
the
visitors
book
he
sent
the
tool
to
them
with
an
explanation
which
i
should
have
loved
to
read
and
it
appears
that
though
nick
is
honest
personally
he
is
a
thief
for
the
car
and
in
bengal
took
anything
new
and
nice
which
other
motors
had
and
his
had
now
norton
is
afraid
that
if
sir
lionel
scolds
him
much
he
will
commit
on
the
threshold
of
the
hotel
which
would
be
embarrassing
and
it
does
no
good
to
tell
her
that
is
a
japanese
or
chinese
trick
she
says
if
nick
would
not
do
that
he
might
do
something
worse
gliding
over
the
perfect
roads
of
the
forest
apollo
seemed
actually
to
float
i
never
felt
anything
so
delicious
and
so
like
being
a
goddess
reclining
on
a
cloud
no
wonder
motorists
faces
when
you
can
see
them
almost
always
look
madly
happy
so
different
from
hay
motorists
as
the
blot
says
generally
look
grumpy
the
little
wild
ponies
were
one
of
the
forest
surprises
for
me
we
met
lots
of
them
mostly
miniature
mothers
giving
their
rough
babies
an
airing
delightful
beastkins
and
i
almost
liked
senter
for
having
a
cousin
who
owns
one
of
these
ponies
as
a
pet
a
dwarf
one
no
bigger
than
a
bernard
dog
it
wears
a
collar
with
silver
bells
follows
her
everywhere
thinks
nothing
of
curling
up
on
a
sofa
and
once
was
found
on
its
mistress
bed
asleep
on
a
new
paris
hat
the
enticing
cottages
we
passed
ought
to
have
told
me
that
we
were
back
in
hampshire
again
if
the
new
forest
had
seemed
to
a
poor
little
foreigner
like
a
separate
county
all
by
itself
it
would
be
no
credit
to
a
bride
to
clamour
for
love
in
such
a
cottage
and
turn
up
her
nose
at
palaces
she
might
be
married
at
the
beautiful
church
of
lyndhurst
a
most
immediate
jewel
of
a
church
with
an
exquisite
by
lord
leighton
a
flaxman
and
a
startlingly
fine
piece
of
sculpture
by
an
artist
named
cockerell
then
safely
wedded
plunge
with
her
bridegroom
into
the
forest
and
be
perfectly
happy
without
ever
coming
out
again
i
wish
i
had
had
the
forest
lovers
to
while
we
were
there
i
think
maurice
hewlett
must
have
got
part
of
his
inspiration
in
those
mysterious
green
walks
which
lead
away
into
that
land
where
fairy
lore
and
historic
legend
go
hand
in
hand
lyndhurst
which
king
george
iii
loved
is
pretty
but
we
did
stop
to
look
at
it
because
we
were
coming
back
that
way
after
seeing
the
church
which
though
modern
i
would
have
missed
for
a
great
deal
we
spun
on
to
beaulieu
abbey
the
home
of
a
hero
of
motoring
there
we
saw
a
perfect
house
rising
among
trees
and
sharing
with
the
sky
a
clear
sheet
of
water
as
a
mirror
once
this
was
a
for
the
abbey
now
it
called
the
palace
house
and
deserves
its
name
its
is
really
only
a
long
creek
which
spills
out
of
the
solent
but
it
seems
like
a
lake
and
you
only
to
walk
along
a
meadow
path
to
the
refectory
of
the
old
abbey
from
there
you
go
through
a
mysterious
door
into
the
ruined
cloisters
which
used
to
belong
to
the
cistercians
the
white
monks
king
john
provided
money
for
the
building
which
proves
that
it
an
ill
wind
which
blows
no
one
any
good
because
the
stingy
tyrannical
old
king
would
have
given
a
penny
to
the
abbots
if
they
had
scourged
him
in
a
nightmare
he
had
i
sha
soon
forget
the
magnolia
and
the
myrtle
in
the
quadrangle
and
if
i
were
one
of
the
monks
i
should
haunt
the
place
there
could
be
a
lovelier
one
from
beaulieu
we
went
to
lymington
a
quaint
and
ancient
town
with
a
picturesque
port
everything
there
looked
happy
and
sleepy
except
the
postillions
on
the
bournemouth
coach
which
was
stopping
at
the
hotel
where
we
had
an
early
lunch
they
were
wide
awake
and
jolly
under
their
beaver
hats
after
lymington
we
skimmed
through
the
forest
hardly
knowing
or
caring
whither
though
we
did
manage
to
find
brockenhurst
and
mark
ash
which
was
almost
the
finest
of
all
with
its
glorious
trees
our
one
wish
was
to
avoid
highways
and
sir
lionel
was
clever
about
that
the
sweetest
bit
was
a
mere
hardly
to
be
called
a
road
though
the
surface
was
superb
young
nick
had
to
get
down
and
open
a
gate
which
led
into
what
seemed
a
private
place
and
no
one
who
had
been
told
to
go
that
way
would
have
thought
of
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
it
was
just
another
part
of
forest
fairyland
whose
inhabitants
turned
themselves
into
trees
as
we
in
our
intruded
on
them
i
never
saw
such
extraordinary
imitations
of
the
evergreen
family
as
they
contrived
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
was
a
glamorous
wood
and
throughout
the
whole
forest
i
had
more
and
more
the
feeling
that
england
is
so
small
as
it
painted
there
are
such
vast
spaces
not
lived
in
at
all
yet
haunted
with
legend
and
history
one
place
we
passed
hardly
a
place
it
was
so
small
was
called
tyrrel
ford
and
there
sir
walter
tyrrel
is
said
to
have
stopped
to
have
his
horse
shoes
reversed
by
a
blacksmith
on
his
flight
to
the
sea
after
killing
the
red
king
or
no
now
i
remember
this
was
next
day
between
ringwood
and
christchurch
when
we
were
having
tea
at
lyndhurst
on
our
way
back
at
a
hotel
like
a
country
house
in
a
great
garden
we
found
out
that
it
once
had
been
the
home
of
your
cousin
the
duc
de
stacpoole
who
came
to
england
with
louis
philippe
there
his
beautiful
tapestry
to
this
day
in
the
and
his
gorgeous
magnolia
tree
looking
wistfully
into
the
window
as
if
asking
why
he
is
there
to
admire
its
creamy
flowers
big
as
fat
snowballs
on
our
way
home
the
rabbits
of
the
new
forest
were
having
a
party
and
were
annoyed
with
us
for
coming
to
it
without
invitations
they
kept
crossing
our
path
as
people
in
melodramas
say
so
that
we
had
to
go
slowly
not
to
run
over
them
and
sometimes
they
galloped
ahead
just
in
front
of
us
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
so
that
we
could
pass
them
dick
kept
longing
to
pot
at
the
poor
little
pets
but
sir
lionel
said
he
had
lived
out
of
england
long
enough
to
find
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
in
life
without
taking
that
of
any
other
creature
that
is
a
very
dragonish
sentiment
is
it
next
day
we
had
a
delicious
run
there
no
other
adjective
which
quite
expresses
it
through
ringwood
which
is
a
door
of
the
forest
to
christchurch
another
abbey
no
it
a
priory
but
to
me
that
a
detail
which
stands
looking
at
its
own
beauty
in
a
crystal
mirror
augustan
not
cistercian
like
beaulieu
and
it
august
as
well
very
noble
finer
to
see
than
many
a
cathedral
you
and
i
in
other
lands
have
industriously
travelled
many
miles
to
visit
churches
without
half
as
many
features
as
christchurch
one
of
its
quaintest
is
a
window
and
a
few
of
the
beauties
are
the
north
transept
with
unique
hatchet
ornamentation
a
choir
with
wonderful
old
oak
carvings
and
the
tomb
of
the
countess
of
salisbury
of
whom
you
read
aloud
to
me
when
i
was
small
in
a
book
called
some
heroines
of
history
she
came
last
in
the
volume
because
she
was
only
a
countess
and
not
a
queen
but
i
cried
when
she
said
she
did
mind
being
killed
only
being
touched
by
a
horrid
common
axe
and
wanted
them
to
cut
off
her
head
with
a
sword
there
are
lots
of
other
beautiful
things
in
the
church
too
and
a
nice
legend
about
an
oak
beam
which
grew
long
in
the
night
and
building
materials
which
came
down
from
a
hill
of
their
own
accord
because
one
of
the
builders
was
christ
himself
that
why
they
named
it
christchurch
you
see
instead
of
twyneham
as
it
would
otherwise
have
been
we
stopped
only
long
enough
after
we
had
seen
the
priory
to
pay
our
respects
to
a
splendid
old
norman
house
near
by
and
then
dashed
away
toward
boscombe
and
bournemouth
which
reminded
me
a
little
of
with
its
gardens
and
fountains
and
running
waters
its
charming
trees
and
shops
just
because
it
modern
we
did
pause
but
swept
on
through
scenery
which
suddenly
degenerated
however
as
i
heard
sir
lionel
say
to
senter
you
ca
go
far
in
this
country
without
finding
beauty
and
presently
she
was
her
own
lovely
self
again
fair
as
nature
intended
her
to
be
i
mean
england
not
senter
who
is
lovelier
than
nature
made
her
we
ran
through
miles
of
dense
pine
forests
where
rhododendrons
grew
wild
where
gulls
spread
silver
wings
and
trailed
coral
feet
a
few
yards
above
our
heads
and
the
tang
of
the
sea
mingled
with
in
our
nostrils
soon
after
dull
but
historic
wareham
we
came
quite
into
the
heart
of
thomas
hardy
country
scarcely
had
we
turned
our
backs
on
wareham
which
i
was
sorry
to
do
when
i
cried
out
at
something
on
a
distant
height
something
which
was
like
a
background
in
a
mediæval
picture
it
was
corfe
castle
of
which
i
been
thinking
ever
since
amesbury
because
of
the
wicked
elfrida
but
the
glimpse
was
delusive
for
the
dark
shape
hid
in
a
moment
and
we
did
see
it
again
for
a
long
time
not
until
our
curving
road
ran
along
underneath
the
towering
hill
then
it
soared
up
with
imposing
effect
giving
an
impression
of
grisly
strength
which
was
heightened
the
nearer
we
approached
distance
lends
no
enchantment
to
corfe
for
the
castle
dominates
the
dour
gray
town
that
huddles
round
it
and
is
never
nobler
than
when
you
tap
for
admittance
at
its
gates
i
tried
to
think
as
we
waited
to
go
in
how
young
edward
felt
edward
the
martyr
when
he
stood
at
the
gates
waiting
to
go
in
and
visit
his
whom
he
loved
and
his
elfrida
whom
he
hated
he
never
left
the
castle
alive
poor
boy
afterward
in
the
ruins
i
went
to
the
window
where
elfrida
was
supposed
to
have
watched
the
young
king
coming
before
she
ran
down
to
the
gates
and
directed
the
murder
which
was
planned
to
give
her
own
son
the
kingdom
it
made
the
story
seem
almost
too
realistic
because
as
you
often
tell
me
my
imagination
carries
me
too
fast
and
too
far
there
nothing
easier
than
to
send
it
back
ten
or
twelve
centuries
in
the
same
number
of
minutes
and
such
a
cheap
way
of
travelling
too
corfe
is
in
dorset
you
must
know
a
county
as
different
from
others
as
i
am
different
from
the
real
ellaline
lethbridge
and
the
castle
is
at
the
very
centre
of
the
isle
of
purbeck
which
makes
it
seem
even
more
romantic
than
it
would
otherwise
i
afraid
it
was
really
even
begun
in
the
days
of
elfrida
or
ælfrith
who
had
only
a
hunting
lodge
there
but
if
people
point
out
her
window
am
i
to
blame
if
i
try
to
make
firm
belief
attract
shy
facts
besides
facts
are
such
dull
dogs
in
the
historical
kennels
until
they
been
taught
a
few
tricks
anyhow
corfe
is
norman
at
worst
and
not
only
did
king
john
keep
much
treasure
there
but
one
supposes
there
some
hidden
still
if
i
could
only
have
found
it
i
be
buying
a
castle
for
you
and
me
to
live
in
sir
lionel
thinks
that
i
as
his
ward
will
live
in
his
castle
and
he
was
telling
me
at
corfe
about
the
norman
tower
at
graylees
but
alas
i
knew
better
oh
i
did
mean
that
alas
consider
it
erased
and
the
other
silly
things
i
wrote
you
the
other
night
please
they
all
so
there
were
loads
of
interesting
prisoners
in
corfe
castle
at
one
time
or
another
knights
from
france
and
fair
ladies
the
fairest
of
all
the
beautiful
damsel
of
brittany
who
had
claims
to
the
english
crown
and
kings
have
visited
there
and
in
cromwell
day
a
lady
and
her
daughters
successfully
defended
it
in
a
great
siege
it
was
such
a
splendid
and
brave
defence
that
it
seems
sad
even
to
this
day
to
think
how
the
castle
fell
after
all
a
year
later
and
to
see
the
great
stones
and
masses
of
masonry
lying
far
below
the
height
exactly
where
they
rolled
when
parliament
ordered
the
conquered
towers
to
be
blown
up
by
gunpowder
the
bankes
family
who
still
own
corfe
must
be
proud
of
that
lady
bankes
their
ancestress
who
held
the
castle
and
is
it
nice
the
bankes
still
have
the
old
keys
where
they
live
at
kingston
lacy
you
like
thomas
hardy
hand
of
ethelberta
next
to
far
from
the
madding
crowd
well
coomb
castle
in
that
book
is
really
corfe
castle
i
told
you
we
were
in
hardy
country
after
wareham
and
not
very
far
away
at
wool
is
an
old
old
of
the
turbervilles
turned
into
a
farmhouse
now
you
do
need
to
be
reminded
of
what
hardy
made
of
that
i
know
we
lunched
at
an
interesting
old
inn
like
all
the
rest
of
the
ancient
houses
of
corfe
grim
and
gray
then
we
coasted
down
the
steep
hill
to
the
plain
again
making
for
swanage
it
was
dusty
but
we
were
sorry
because
just
when
we
were
travelling
rather
fast
on
a
perfectly
clear
road
a
policeman
popped
out
like
a
apparently
from
nowhere
you
could
tell
by
his
face
he
was
a
trappist
as
dick
calls
the
and
though
sir
lionel
was
really
going
beyond
the
legal
limit
he
glared
at
our
number
as
if
he
meant
mischief
but
that
had
thoughtfully
masked
itself
in
dust
so
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
he
could
work
us
no
harm
after
our
backs
were
turned
once
in
a
while
it
does
seem
as
if
nature
sympathized
with
the
poor
maligned
motorist
whom
nobody
loves
and
is
willing
to
throw
her
protection
over
him
it
would
be
like
tempting
providence
to
polish
off
dust
or
mud
in
such
circumstances
would
it
my
face
was
a
different
matter
though
and
i
longed
to
polish
it
before
we
got
to
swanage
it
felt
even
under
chiffon
just
as
an
iced
cake
must
feel
only
the
cake
fortunately
for
its
contour
never
needs
to
smile
we
were
going
to
swanage
because
of
the
caves
tilly
whim
caves
did
you
ever
hear
of
them
parisienne
mamma
small
blame
to
you
if
not
because
one
ca
know
everything
but
they
are
worth
seeing
and
the
swanage
harbour
is
a
little
dream
the
town
is
good
too
and
very
very
as
if
it
were
full
of
lawyers
and
clergymen
yet
not
dull
like
wareham
which
was
important
in
saxon
days
long
before
swanage
was
born
or
thought
of
it
knollsea
in
the
hand
of
ethelberta
do
you
remember
and
alfred
the
great
had
a
victory
close
by
so
close
that
in
a
storm
the
danish
ships
blew
into
what
is
the
town
now
as
if
they
had
been
butterflies
with
their
wings
wet
we
climbed
up
up
above
the
village
in
the
on
the
steepest
twistingest
road
i
seen
yet
in
england
though
sir
lionel
says
think
nothing
of
it
when
we
get
into
devonshire
up
up
to
a
high
place
where
they
built
a
restaurant
near
by
we
left
the
motor
and
emily
who
never
walks
for
pleasure
and
ho
for
the
caves
it
was
a
scramble
among
dark
cliffs
of
purbeck
limestone
the
caves
are
delightfully
weird
and
of
course
there
are
smuggling
stories
about
them
a
strange
wind
blew
through
their
labyrinths
ceaselessly
like
the
breathings
of
a
hidden
giant
betrayed
by
sleep
it
was
heavenly
cool
in
that
dim
twilight
that
never
knew
sun
but
oh
it
was
hot
coming
out
into
the
afternoon
glare
and
climbing
the
steep
path
to
where
the
motor
waited
i
think
senter
was
sorry
she
had
stopped
with
emily
she
got
a
horrid
headache
and
felt
so
ill
that
sir
lionel
asked
if
she
would
care
to
stop
all
night
at
swanage
and
she
said
she
would
fortunately
it
turned
out
that
there
were
good
hotels
and
sir
lionel
took
rooms
at
the
one
we
liked
the
best
in
an
agreeable
way
senter
went
to
bed
but
the
rest
of
us
strolled
out
after
dinner
and
norton
began
talking
to
dick
about
his
mother
which
threw
sir
lionel
and
me
together
we
sat
on
the
pier
where
the
moon
turned
bright
pink
as
she
dipped
down
into
a
bank
of
clouds
like
a
growing
out
of
the
sea
and
even
when
it
was
dark
the
sea
kept
its
colour
the
deep
blue
of
sapphires
where
at
a
distance
little
white
yachts
and
sailboats
looked
like
a
company
of
crescent
moons
floating
in
an
azure
sky
i
felt
in
the
sweetest
mood
kind
toward
all
the
world
and
particularly
to
sir
lionel
i
could
bear
to
remember
that
i
ever
had
bad
thoughts
and
doubts
so
i
was
half
nicer
to
him
than
i
ever
was
before
dick
kept
glaring
at
me
from
his
seat
beside
norton
and
drawing
his
eyebrows
together
when
he
thought
sir
lionel
was
looking
going
home
he
got
a
chance
for
a
few
words
when
emily
was
speaking
to
her
brother
about
senter
headache
he
said
that
there
was
something
he
must
say
to
me
alone
and
he
wanted
me
to
come
out
into
the
garden
behind
the
hotel
to
talk
to
him
when
the
others
had
gone
to
bed
but
of
course
i
refused
then
he
said
would
i
manage
to
give
him
a
few
minutes
next
day
and
intimated
gently
that
i
be
sorry
if
i
did
i
told
him
that
i
see
which
is
always
a
safe
answer
but
i
have
managed
yet
when
i
got
back
to
my
room
at
the
hotel
i
noticed
that
some
of
my
things
were
in
the
places
where
i
left
them
and
the
writing
portfolio
in
a
which
sir
lionel
is
mine
but
is
really
ellaline
one
of
the
bond
street
purchases
had
my
papers
changed
about
in
it
the
servants
in
the
house
seemed
so
respectable
and
nice
i
ca
think
that
one
of
them
would
have
pried
and
yet
well
the
truth
is
i
afraid
of
being
catty
but
i
ca
help
putting
headache
and
my
disturbed
papers
together
in
my
mind
two
and
two
when
put
together
make
four
you
know
and
her
room
in
the
swanage
hotel
was
next
to
mine
she
might
have
been
sure
that
we
all
go
out
after
dinner
on
such
a
perfect
night
but
why
should
she
bother
unless
dick
has
told
her
something
after
all
i
suppose
i
shall
never
know
whether
it
was
she
or
someone
else
who
meddled
i
looked
through
all
the
papers
and
other
things
but
could
find
nothing
compromising
as
the
adventuresses
say
however
i
ca
quite
remember
what
i
had
some
letter
may
have
been
taken
i
have
been
a
tiny
bit
worried
since
for
you
know
ellaline
would
never
forgive
me
if
anything
should
go
wrong
now
and
i
been
thinking
that
though
sir
lionel
is
no
dragon
there
may
be
something
about
honoré
du
guesclin
which
he
would
approve
ellaline
may
even
have
her
own
reasons
for
thinking
he
would
approve
dragon
or
no
dragon
very
likely
she
did
tell
me
everything
she
was
so
anxious
to
have
her
own
way
but
to
go
back
to
the
journey
here
almost
each
mile
we
travelled
gave
us
some
thought
of
hardy
and
acquainted
me
with
the
character
of
dorset
which
is
just
what
i
expected
from
his
books
giant
trees
tall
secretive
hedges
high
brick
walls
mellow
with
age
and
curtained
with
ivy
stone
cottages
solid
and
prosperous
and
old
with
queer
little
purbeck
granite
bursting
through
the
grass
of
meadows
and
making
a
grave
background
for
brilliant
flowers
heaths
that
hardy
wrote
about
in
the
return
of
the
native
heaths
heaths
and
rolling
downs
we
took
the
way
from
swanage
to
west
lulworth
and
had
an
adventure
on
a
hill
sir
lionel
is
very
strict
with
his
little
buddha
about
examining
everything
that
could
possibly
go
wrong
with
the
motor
and
just
before
we
started
i
heard
him
ask
young
nick
if
he
had
looked
at
the
brakes
after
our
descent
from
tilly
whim
oh
yes
sahib
said
the
brown
image
oh
no
said
the
brakes
themselves
on
a
big
hill
as
far
from
the
madding
crowd
as
gabriel
and
bathsheba
ever
lived
we
got
lost
and
that
was
the
way
the
car
punished
us
first
of
all
the
motor
refused
to
work
that
made
apollo
feel
faint
so
that
he
began
to
run
backward
down
the
hill
instead
of
going
up
and
when
sir
lionel
put
on
the
brakes
they
would
act
it
was
the
first
time
anything
really
bad
had
happened
and
my
heart
gave
a
jump
but
somehow
i
was
frightened
with
sir
lionel
driving
it
seemed
as
if
no
harm
could
come
and
it
did
for
he
steered
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
brought
the
car
up
short
against
a
great
hummock
of
grass
all
the
same
we
nearly
tipped
over
and
sir
lionel
told
us
to
jump
i
should
have
stirred
if
he
had
spoken
i
should
have
awaited
orders
but
the
others
were
moving
before
we
stopped
and
senter
fell
down
and
bumped
her
knee
that
made
her
hair
come
partly
undone
and
to
my
horror
a
bunch
of
the
dearest
little
curls
which
i
always
thought
lived
there
were
loosened
there
was
a
great
wind
blowing
and
in
a
second
more
the
curls
would
have
been
on
the
horizon
if
i
had
seized
them
just
as
they
were
about
to
take
flight
if
they
gone
they
must
have
passed
almost
in
front
of
sir
lionel
nose
on
their
way
would
that
have
been
dreadful
i
should
think
she
could
never
have
looked
him
in
the
face
again
for
her
hair
her
greatest
beauty
and
she
continually
saying
things
about
its
being
all
her
own
and
having
more
than
she
knows
what
to
do
with
but
luckily
his
back
was
turned
when
i
caught
the
curls
and
stuffed
them
hastily
into
her
hand
before
she
was
on
her
feet
nobody
seeing
except
dick
i
suppose
a
nephew
does
count
but
do
you
know
dear
if
they
been
my
curls
i
believe
she
have
loved
sir
lionel
to
see
them
i
do
like
her
a
bit
but
all
the
more
i
could
be
mean
i
reserve
all
my
cattyness
toward
her
for
my
letters
to
you
when
i
let
myself
go
and
stretch
my
little
nails
in
my
velvet
paw
i
was
sorry
for
young
nick
he
was
miserably
sheepish
and
vowed
that
he
really
had
examined
the
brakes
sir
lionel
just
looked
at
him
and
raised
his
eyebrows
that
was
all
because
he
would
scold
the
poor
little
wretch
before
us
it
was
as
much
as
the
three
men
could
do
to
get
apollo
down
on
his
four
tires
again
for
though
he
seemed
as
lightly
balanced
as
an
eccentric
dancer
trying
to
touch
one
eyelid
to
the
floor
he
was
partly
embedded
in
the
bank
by
the
roadside
then
we
all
sat
gracefully
about
while
sir
lionel
and
the
chauffeur
worked
young
nick
under
the
car
looking
sometimes
like
a
contortionist
tying
himself
into
lover
knots
sometimes
like
a
miniature
michelangelo
lying
on
his
back
to
paint
a
fresco
i
hope
though
that
michael
never
had
half
the
trouble
finding
his
paints
and
brushes
that
nick
had
to
get
at
his
tommies
and
jemmies
and
dozens
of
strange
little
instruments
he
lay
with
his
mouth
bristling
with
giant
pins
and
had
the
air
of
a
conscientious
dentist
filling
a
difficult
tooth
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
brakes
were
properly
tightened
up
and
the
four
cylinders
breathing
freely
again
but
it
would
have
been
ungracious
to
be
bored
in
such
a
glorious
wild
place
in
such
glorious
weather
there
was
a
kind
of
walt
whitman
feeling
in
the
air
that
made
me
want
to
sing
and
finally
i
could
resist
no
longer
i
burst
out
with
those
verses
of
his
which
you
set
to
music
for
me
at
least
i
sang
a
few
bars
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
sir
lionel
wheel
round
and
look
at
me
when
he
heard
my
voice
i
never
said
anything
to
him
about
knowing
how
to
sing
so
he
was
surprised
why
you
have
quite
a
pretty
voice
ellaline
said
norton
a
pretty
voice
i
should
say
she
had
remarked
sir
lionel
he
did
say
any
more
but
i
never
had
a
compliment
i
liked
better
and
i
did
mind
a
bit
when
senter
remarked
that
anyone
would
fancy
i
was
a
professional
i
was
almost
sorry
to
go
on
at
last
though
emily
was
worrying
lest
we
should
get
no
lunch
but
we
saw
beautiful
things
as
we
spun
toward
lulworth
rushing
so
swiftly
along
an
empty
road
that
the
hedges
roared
past
us
like
dark
cataracts
it
was
thrilling
and
showed
what
apollo
could
do
when
he
chose
if
there
had
been
a
soul
on
the
road
of
course
we
would
have
done
such
deeds
though
i
must
say
from
what
seen
if
you
creep
along
so
as
not
to
kick
up
a
dust
and
annoy
people
they
are
at
all
grateful
but
only
scorn
instead
of
hating
you
and
think
you
ca
go
faster
or
you
would
still
you
have
the
consciousness
of
innocence
one
thing
we
saw
was
a
delightful
tudor
house
called
creech
grange
and
the
ancestor
of
the
man
who
owns
it
built
bond
street
i
sure
i
do
know
why
but
i
glad
he
did
we
took
the
valley
way
on
purpose
to
see
the
grange
instead
of
going
over
ring
hill
and
other
windy
heights
but
it
was
worth
the
sacrifice
lulworth
castle
which
we
passed
is
rather
like
graylees
sir
lionel
said
so
now
i
wish
more
than
ever
that
i
could
see
graylees
for
lulworth
is
fine
and
feudal
but
i
shall
have
burst
like
a
bubble
before
the
time
comes
for
graylees
there
i
have
brought
you
with
us
to
lulworth
cove
at
last
the
adorable
little
place
where
at
this
moment
as
i
told
you
at
the
beginning
of
my
letter
i
sitting
on
the
beach
among
red
and
green
fishing
boats
you
would
dream
of
lulworth
existence
until
it
suddenly
breaks
on
you
and
you
see
the
blue
bay
lying
asleep
in
the
arms
of
giant
rocks
which
appear
to
have
had
a
violent
convulsion
without
disturbing
the
baby
sheet
of
water
i
suppose
they
were
angry
with
the
world
for
finding
out
their
secret
for
it
has
found
out
and
loves
to
come
to
lulworth
cove
however
the
place
contrives
to
as
unknown
as
ever
as
if
only
some
lazy
gulls
and
a
few
fishermen
mending
had
ever
heard
a
hint
of
it
there
a
narrow
street
a
few
pretty
old
cottages
a
comfortable
hotel
where
we
had
crabs
divine
though
devilled
and
au
floating
in
flames
of
the
blue
i
should
like
my
eyes
to
be
when
angry
there
a
and
nothing
else
that
i
can
think
of
except
circling
hills
a
golden
sweep
of
beach
and
sea
of
ethereal
azure
creaming
against
contorted
rocks
that
all
but
it
a
little
paradise
and
of
the
same
just
there
i
was
interrupted
dick
burden
came
and
i
had
to
listen
to
him
unless
i
wanted
a
scene
i
could
appeal
to
any
nice
brown
fisherman
to
please
feed
him
to
the
lobsters
so
i
sat
still
and
let
him
talk
he
said
that
he
was
awfully
in
love
with
me
a
charming
fashion
he
taken
to
show
it
has
he
as
i
remarked
to
him
he
replied
in
the
old
old
way
about
all
being
fair
etc
i
asked
him
which
it
was
love
or
war
and
he
said
it
was
both
he
knew
i
in
love
i
should
think
not
indeed
but
he
wanted
me
to
promise
to
be
engaged
to
him
from
now
on
i
wo
said
i
short
and
sudden
like
that
you
jolly
well
have
to
said
he
then
he
proceeded
to
warn
me
that
if
i
did
my
friend
miss
ellaline
lethbridge
must
look
out
for
herself
because
i
would
no
longer
be
in
a
position
to
guard
her
interests
i
mentioned
that
he
was
a
perfect
beast
and
he
said
it
might
be
true
but
i
was
a
deceiver
and
it
was
not
good
taste
for
the
pot
to
call
the
kettle
black
i
rather
go
into
the
kind
of
convent
where
one
not
allowed
to
speak
a
word
all
one
life
except
than
marry
you
said
i
politely
but
it
seemed
that
he
was
thinking
so
much
about
being
married
as
just
being
engaged
as
to
marrying
we
were
both
very
young
and
he
would
wait
for
me
till
we
could
afford
to
marry
which
might
be
for
some
time
yet
he
explained
what
he
was
keen
on
beginning
at
once
was
being
engaged
why
i
asked
savagely
because
i
do
want
anyone
else
to
think
he
has
a
chance
that
the
plain
truth
said
dick
in
the
most
brazen
way
that
staggered
me
for
he
was
glaring
straight
into
my
eyes
in
such
a
meaning
way
i
could
help
understanding
was
in
his
mind
so
utterly
as
if
the
person
he
meant
would
ever
think
of
me
and
dick
used
to
say
himself
that
sir
lionel
pendragon
took
no
interest
in
girls
or
any
women
except
senter
i
have
liked
to
remind
him
of
this
only
i
would
let
him
see
that
i
read
his
thoughts
i
believe
you
must
be
mad
said
i
i
should
wonder
said
he
anyhow
i
mad
enough
to
go
straight
to
sir
lionel
with
the
whole
story
the
minute
he
comes
back
from
his
walk
with
his
sister
and
my
aunt
unless
you
do
what
i
want
that
wo
be
very
nice
for
senter
i
temporized
if
enjoying
this
trip
she
was
so
anxious
to
take
for
if
sir
lionel
knows
about
ellaline
the
tour
will
probably
break
up
and
he
rush
over
to
france
on
the
contrary
it
will
be
nice
for
her
dick
returned
because
many
a
heart
is
caught
in
the
rebound
i
said
that
this
argument
was
too
intricate
for
me
but
it
really
i
knew
quite
well
what
he
meant
though
of
course
he
is
absolutely
mistaken
as
far
as
sir
lionel
feelings
toward
me
are
concerned
but
i
had
to
think
quickly
and
i
thought
maybe
he
was
right
about
his
aunt
she
would
be
a
woman
who
would
make
use
of
an
emergency
and
once
she
had
compromised
poor
sir
lionel
it
would
be
too
late
for
i
have
an
idea
he
be
exaggeratedly
honourable
you
may
smile
at
my
saying
she
compromise
him
but
you
know
what
i
mean
i
not
sure
do
but
anyhow
i
could
bear
to
have
her
do
it
especially
if
it
could
be
prevented
by
me
i
sat
still
a
minute
reflecting
and
then
asked
dick
what
he
meant
by
being
engaged
he
replied
that
he
meant
the
usual
thing
and
i
replied
to
this
that
nothing
could
tempt
me
he
saw
i
would
go
back
from
my
word
so
he
promised
if
i
be
engaged
that
he
not
try
even
to
hold
my
hand
until
i
should
be
willing
all
he
would
ask
was
that
he
might
tell
his
aunt
we
had
a
kind
of
a
sort
of
an
understanding
which
might
develop
into
an
engagement
and
let
tell
sir
lionel
nothing
more
than
that
and
why
should
i
mind
when
in
any
case
there
could
never
have
been
a
question
of
my
marrying
sir
i
said
i
did
mind
horribly
but
not
on
that
account
and
i
should
never
marry
anyone
i
was
almost
ready
to
cry
i
felt
so
wretched
i
think
i
was
ever
as
miserable
in
my
life
dear
though
when
i
come
to
argue
it
out
with
myself
i
pretended
so
much
to
please
ellaline
it
ought
to
matter
pretending
a
little
more
just
then
all
three
of
the
others
came
along
and
seeing
us
on
the
beach
joined
us
dick
put
on
a
familiar
air
with
me
as
if
he
had
rights
and
i
saw
sir
lionel
glance
from
me
to
him
and
draw
his
eyebrows
together
i
came
indoors
then
to
my
room
and
did
go
out
again
till
dinner
time
i
was
half
afraid
senter
might
already
have
got
in
her
deadly
work
but
if
she
had
sir
lionel
did
say
anything
to
me
only
it
was
a
horrid
dinner
in
spite
of
nice
seaside
things
to
eat
nobody
spoke
much
and
i
felt
so
choked
i
could
hardly
swallow
oh
i
am
homesick
for
you
dear
i
hurried
upstairs
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
saying
i
had
letters
to
write
early
we
start
for
sidmouth
in
devonshire
going
by
way
of
weymouth
and
dorchester
as
i
write
looking
from
my
window
across
which
i
have
drawn
the
curtains
i
can
see
sir
lionel
and
senter
strolling
out
of
the
hotel
toward
the
beach
there
a
lovely
blue
dusk
which
the
sunset
struck
into
a
million
glorious
sparks
and
then
let
fade
again
into
a
dull
glow
like
ashes
of
roses
they
look
a
romantic
couple
walking
together
i
wonder
if
they
are
talking
about
each
other
to
each
other
or
about
and
i
feel
as
if
i
should
have
to
scream
sir
lionel
do
believe
it
it
is
true
but
of
course
i
ca
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
and
then
i
wo
be
tempted
to
look
out
of
the
window
always
your
own
loving
audrie
please
write
at
once
and
address
poste
restante
torquay
xiv
sir
lionel
pendragon
to
colonel
patrick
park
hotel
sidmouth
my
dear
pat
i
am
a
fool
by
this
time
you
will
soon
be
receiving
my
first
letter
and
saying
to
yourself
he
is
on
the
way
to
being
a
fool
well
i
am
already
that
fool
i
did
see
where
i
was
drifting
but
i
see
now
that
it
had
begun
then
and
of
course
you
a
spectator
wo
be
dense
as
i
was
at
first
you
will
know
i
did
suppose
this
thing
could
happen
to
me
again
i
thought
i
was
safe
but
at
forty
it
worse
with
me
than
when
i
was
i
do
need
to
explain
yet
i
will
say
in
that
fool
as
i
am
i
am
not
going
to
let
anyone
but
you
know
that
i
a
fool
especially
the
girl
she
would
be
thunderstruck
not
that
girls
of
nineteen
have
married
men
of
forty
and
perhaps
cared
for
them
but
this
girl
has
been
brought
up
since
her
babyhood
to
think
of
me
as
her
guardian
and
an
elderly
person
beyond
the
pale
where
love
or
even
flirtation
is
concerned
imagine
a
daughter
and
namesake
of
ellaline
de
nesville
being
in
the
society
of
a
man
and
not
trying
to
flirt
with
him
it
almost
inconceivable
but
ellaline
the
second
shows
not
the
slightest
inclination
to
flirt
with
me
she
is
gentle
sweet
charming
even
obedient
perhaps
i
might
say
daughterly
if
i
were
willing
to
hurt
my
own
feelings
therefore
even
without
dick
burden
oppressive
respect
for
me
i
must
suppose
that
i
am
regarded
as
a
generation
behind
by
the
way
that
young
beast
made
me
a
present
of
a
cane
the
other
day
not
an
ordinary
stick
but
an
old
gentleman
cane
with
a
gold
head
on
it
he
said
he
saw
it
in
a
shop
at
weymouth
where
we
stopped
for
lunch
and
thought
it
so
handsome
he
begged
that
i
would
accept
it
his
aunt
laughed
called
him
a
ridiculous
little
boy
and
advised
me
to
have
thou
shalt
not
steal
engraved
on
a
gold
band
with
my
name
and
address
this
was
to
soothe
my
but
while
i
wonder
whether
the
thing
really
a
gift
suitable
to
my
years
i
long
to
lay
it
across
the
giver
back
he
gave
it
to
me
before
ellaline
too
what
an
idiot
i
am
to
care
i
can
laugh
for
my
sense
of
humour
has
yet
jilted
me
if
my
good
sense
has
but
the
laugh
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
my
mouth
i
feel
somewhat
better
having
confessed
my
foolishness
which
you
would
have
divined
without
the
confession
the
girl
does
suspect
i
enact
the
heavy
father
even
more
ostentatiously
than
if
i
were
ass
enough
to
prefer
a
rôle
for
which
time
and
our
relationship
have
unfitted
me
but
it
rather
curious
is
it
what
power
one
little
woman
can
wield
over
a
man
life
even
the
life
of
a
man
who
is
as
far
as
possible
from
being
a
woman
man
ellaline
de
nesville
pretty
well
spoiled
my
early
youth
or
would
if
i
had
freed
myself
to
take
up
other
interests
she
burdens
the
remainder
of
my
young
years
by
making
me
willy
nilly
the
guardian
of
her
child
and
not
content
with
that
she
indirectly
destroys
what
might
have
been
the
comfortable
contentment
of
my
middle
age
women
are
the
devil
all
but
this
one
and
she
is
a
woman
yet
the
dangerous
part
is
that
i
am
not
as
grimly
unhappy
as
i
ought
to
be
there
are
moments
hours
when
i
forget
that
there
any
obstacle
dividing
ellaline
future
from
mine
i
think
of
her
as
belonging
to
me
i
feel
that
she
is
to
be
a
part
of
my
life
always
as
she
is
now
and
until
i
have
again
drummed
it
into
my
rebellious
head
that
she
is
not
for
me
that
my
business
with
her
is
to
see
that
she
gets
a
rich
and
young
husband
not
more
than
of
my
age
i
enjoy
myself
hugely
in
her
nearness
but
why
not
after
all
just
for
the
length
of
this
tour
in
the
which
throws
us
so
constantly
together
as
long
as
i
betray
myself
why
not
why
not
revel
in
borrowed
sunshine
at
graylees
i
can
turn
over
a
new
leaf
i
need
see
very
little
of
her
there
she
and
emily
will
have
plenty
to
do
with
their
social
duties
and
i
shall
have
my
own
let
me
be
a
fool
in
peace
till
graylees
then
if
i
be
a
fool
in
peace
talking
of
borrowed
sunshine
england
seems
to
have
borrowed
an
inexhaustible
supply
from
some
more
favoured
clime
this
summer
i
dare
say
we
shall
have
to
pay
for
it
later
i
shall
have
to
pay
for
my
private
supply
too
but
no
matter
next
to
my
native
cornwall
i
think
i
prefer
devonshire
and
devonshire
is
being
particularly
kind
and
hospitable
offering
us
her
choicest
gifts
it
said
that
the
earth
is
a
host
who
murders
all
his
guests
but
he
certainly
gives
some
of
us
for
some
of
the
time
glorious
innings
during
our
visit
to
him
i
do
complain
though
my
stay
so
far
has
been
accompanied
by
a
good
deal
of
stormy
weather
i
remember
your
once
remarking
that
weymouth
would
be
a
good
place
to
hide
in
if
you
wanted
to
grow
a
beard
or
anything
lingering
and
unbecoming
but
you
would
make
that
remark
now
there
are
too
many
pretty
women
in
the
nice
tranquil
old
town
just
at
this
season
far
from
dull
and
walking
along
the
esplanade
while
young
nick
mended
a
tire
i
understood
something
of
george
the
third
fondness
for
the
place
certainly
vanity
would
permit
you
to
show
your
nose
on
parade
or
beach
in
these
times
during
the
process
for
apparently
no
hour
of
the
day
when
a
lively
scene
is
being
enacted
on
both
the
sands
thickly
dotted
with
tents
charming
girls
bathing
chubby
children
playing
pretty
women
reading
novels
under
red
parasols
fishermen
selling
fish
boatmen
soliciting
custom
the
parade
crowded
with
trippers
soldiers
and
sailors
the
wide
road
noisy
with
and
even
the
sea
gay
with
boats
of
all
descriptions
and
at
least
one
big
war
vessel
hovering
in
the
distance
besides
there
is
the
i
do
know
why
i
like
it
so
much
but
i
do
i
have
a
feeling
that
weymouth
would
be
worth
a
visit
for
the
sake
of
that
clock
alone
and
then
there
the
extraordinary
historical
and
geological
interest
which
no
other
has
burden
was
anxious
to
go
over
to
portland
lured
there
no
doubt
by
the
incipient
detective
talent
of
which
he
boasts
but
the
ladies
voted
it
too
sad
a
place
to
see
on
an
excursion
of
pleasure
and
perhaps
they
were
right
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
like
to
go
and
spend
a
happy
afternoon
staring
at
a
lot
of
unfortunate
wretches
dressed
in
a
pattern
of
broad
arrows
would
go
slumming
out
of
idle
curiosity
and
i
have
always
thought
i
could
not
love
a
woman
who
amused
herself
by
slumming
any
more
than
i
could
love
one
who
eagerly
patronized
thomas
hardy
work
is
too
near
nature
heart
to
appeal
to
senter
and
too
clever
for
my
good
sister
emily
who
will
read
no
author
willingly
unless
he
calls
a
spade
a
hatpin
but
ellaline
strange
to
say
has
been
allowed
to
read
him
evidently
french
schools
are
not
what
they
once
were
and
she
and
i
particularly
wanted
to
go
through
dorchester
his
casterbridge
even
though
we
could
see
nothing
of
hardy
place
max
gate
except
its
a
pity
more
english
towns
have
made
boulevards
of
their
earthworks
since
there
are
plenty
that
have
earthworks
planting
them
with
chestnuts
and
sycamores
as
dorchester
has
cleverly
done
it
was
an
idea
worthy
of
a
mayor
of
casterbridge
we
lingered
a
bit
in
the
car
picking
out
landmarks
of
resemblance
to
the
book
and
there
were
plenty
you
know
there
a
magnificent
roman
amphitheatre
near
by
but
did
we
stay
to
look
at
it
my
friend
we
are
motorists
and
it
happened
to
be
a
grand
day
with
the
car
which
though
still
very
new
has
found
itself
apollo
seemed
a
steed
of
pure
air
and
fire
and
the
dull
elements
of
earth
and
water
never
appear
in
him
he
chafed
against
stopping
and
i
humoured
him
gladly
strange
said
ellaline
yesterday
how
a
person
will
pay
lots
of
money
to
buy
a
and
go
tearing
about
the
world
at
great
expense
to
gratify
two
little
black
or
blue
holes
in
his
face
and
then
instead
of
letting
the
holes
thoroughly
absorb
his
money
worth
he
will
rush
past
some
of
the
best
things
on
earth
rather
than
a
run
but
she
does
take
the
intoxication
of
ozone
into
consideration
in
this
indictment
our
road
was
of
the
best
and
always
interesting
with
some
fine
distant
views
and
here
and
there
an
avenue
of
trees
like
a
vast
gothic
aisle
in
a
cathedral
we
could
see
things
so
nicely
if
it
were
for
the
mists
sighed
emily
who
if
her
wish
had
been
a
broom
would
have
ruthlessly
swept
away
those
lacy
cobwebs
clinging
to
the
why
replied
ellaline
you
could
see
a
bride
face
more
clearly
if
you
took
away
her
veil
but
it
the
prettiest
thing
about
her
that
put
my
feelings
in
a
nutshell
england
would
be
no
bride
for
me
if
she
threw
away
her
veil
and
nowhere
did
it
become
her
more
than
in
dorset
somerset
and
devon
where
it
is
threaded
with
gold
and
embroidered
with
jewels
toward
the
edge
of
sunset
of
course
there
only
the
most
fanciful
dividing
line
between
somerset
and
devon
yet
i
imagine
the
two
counties
different
in
their
attributes
as
well
as
in
their
graces
surely
in
somerset
the
downs
are
on
a
grander
scale
between
two
of
them
you
are
in
a
valley
and
think
that
you
see
mountains
in
devonshire
you
have
wider
horizons
save
for
the
lanes
and
hedges
which
do
their
best
to
keep
straying
eyes
fastened
on
their
own
beauty
i
suppose
men
who
never
have
left
england
take
such
beauty
for
granted
but
to
me
after
the
flaunting
luxuriance
of
the
east
it
is
enchanting
i
notice
everything
i
want
someone
who
cares
for
it
as
i
do
to
admire
it
with
me
if
it
were
for
dick
burden
this
england
would
be
making
me
again
you
should
see
to
understand
me
all
the
lovely
things
fighting
sportively
for
supremacy
in
these
devonshire
hedges
the
convolvulus
pretending
to
throttle
the
honeysuckle
the
honeysuckle
shaking
creamy
fists
in
the
faces
of
roses
that
push
out
blushing
in
the
starlight
of
wild
clematis
white
and
purple
such
gentle
souls
these
devonshire
roses
kind
and
innocent
like
the
sweet
sentimental
evelinas
of
stories
yet
full
of
health
and
tingling
with
buds
as
a
young
girl
with
fancies
devonshire
seems
to
express
herself
in
flowers
as
sterner
counties
do
in
trees
and
rocks
even
the
children
one
meets
playing
in
the
road
are
flowers
they
are
to
the
pretty
cottages
what
the
sweetbriar
is
to
the
hedges
and
no
background
could
be
daintier
for
the
little
human
blossoms
than
those
same
thatched
cottages
with
open
welcoming
doors
ellaline
fascinated
by
glimpses
through
open
doors
old
oak
dressers
set
with
blue
and
white
china
ancient
clocks
with
peering
chairs
bright
flowers
in
gilt
vases
on
tables
all
obscurely
seen
through
rich
brown
shadows
says
she
would
like
to
live
in
such
a
cottage
with
somebody
she
loved
who
will
that
somebody
be
i
constantly
wonder
i
should
think
less
of
her
if
it
could
be
dick
burden
or
one
of
his
type
yet
senter
hints
that
the
girl
likes
his
society
she
we
had
a
picnic
luncheon
on
our
way
to
sidmouth
lingering
rather
long
once
you
have
stopped
your
motor
nothing
matters
if
you
happy
you
are
as
reluctant
to
go
on
as
you
are
to
stop
when
going
then
as
they
all
wished
to
travel
by
moonlight
i
suggested
that
dinner
also
should
be
a
picnic
we
bought
food
and
drink
at
honiton
and
the
country
being
exquisite
between
there
and
sidmouth
we
soon
found
a
fit
for
an
emperor
nearby
glimmered
a
sheet
of
like
a
blue
underground
lake
that
had
broken
through
and
flooded
the
meadow
ellaline
said
she
would
like
to
wash
her
face
in
it
as
if
in
a
fairy
cosmetic
to
make
her
beautiful
forever
i
really
do
believe
she
knows
that
would
be
superfluous
trouble
and
a
fairy
godmother
has
given
her
the
gift
of
song
i
wish
you
could
hear
her
sing
pat
i
have
heard
her
only
once
but
if
i
had
been
a
fool
already
i
have
become
one
then
beyond
recall
so
we
sat
there
on
the
still
blue
brink
of
twilight
till
the
moon
rose
red
as
a
molten
helmet
and
cooled
to
a
silver
bowl
as
she
sailed
higher
dripping
light
but
tell
me
this
would
i
think
of
such
similes
if
i
were
like
a
man
who
has
eaten
hasheesh
and
filled
his
brain
with
a
fantastic
tumult
a
magical
vision
of
romance
such
as
his
heart
never
knew
in
its
youth
never
can
know
except
in
visions
now
that
youth
has
passed
there
joy
as
well
as
pain
in
the
vision
though
i
can
tell
you
as
there
must
be
in
any
mirage
and
it
was
in
a
mirage
of
moonlight
and
mystery
that
we
took
up
our
journey
again
after
that
second
picnic
swooping
from
hill
to
valley
on
our
way
to
the
knoll
park
hotel
it
an
historic
place
by
the
way
with
an
interesting
past
once
it
was
a
country
house
belonging
to
an
eccentric
gentleman
and
at
present
it
is
extremely
ornamental
among
its
lawns
and
lebanon
cedars
as
for
sidmouth
the
town
you
have
but
to
enter
it
to
feel
that
you
are
walking
in
a
quaint
old
coloured
lithograph
one
of
the
sort
you
know
that
the
artist
invariably
dedicated
with
extravagant
humility
to
a
marquis
if
he
did
know
a
duke
there
no
architecture
whatever
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
children
might
have
built
the
original
village
of
sidmouth
as
they
sat
playing
on
the
beach
but
the
queer
cottages
with
their
low
brows
of
thatch
protruding
amid
absurd
battlements
have
a
fantastic
charm
they
are
most
engaging
with
their
like
eyes
in
spectacles
their
green
and
their
smiling
faces
with
low
foreheads
the
house
where
queen
victoria
stopped
as
a
little
girl
is
a
great
show
place
of
course
and
is
like
a
toy
flung
down
against
a
cushiony
hillside
a
battlemented
doll
house
forgotten
by
the
child
who
let
it
fall
while
big
trees
grew
up
and
tried
to
hide
it
two
cliffs
has
sidmouth
and
an
innocent
esplanade
and
that
is
about
all
except
the
toy
town
itself
but
it
a
place
to
stay
in
a
happy
man
would
never
tire
of
it
i
think
an
unhappy
one
might
prefer
brighton
or
monte
carlo
i
am
neither
one
nor
the
other
so
i
prefer
a
we
are
on
the
wing
again
i
must
now
go
to
our
which
looks
over
the
sea
and
play
a
rubber
of
bridge
with
senter
emily
and
burden
ellaline
play
hope
i
have
bored
you
with
my
burden
and
other
complaints
yours
ever
pen
august
i
have
opened
my
letter
again
to
tell
you
what
came
of
that
rubber
of
bridge
i
lost
all
the
glamour
the
reaction
after
the
hasheesh
has
set
in
we
did
play
long
just
that
one
rubber
and
before
we
finished
ellaline
had
taken
her
copy
of
lorna
doone
upstairs
to
her
own
room
without
interrupting
our
game
for
a
she
did
think
we
saw
her
go
but
there
were
two
of
us
who
did
burden
was
one
of
the
two
i
do
need
to
tell
you
who
the
other
fool
was
senter
and
i
were
partners
as
we
generally
are
if
there
any
bridge
going
in
the
evening
she
devoted
to
the
game
and
it
always
she
who
proposes
it
i
would
generally
prefer
to
fag
up
our
route
for
next
day
with
and
but
hosts
like
beggars
be
choosers
well
emily
and
burden
had
all
the
cards
and
burden
wanted
a
second
rubber
but
his
aunt
does
like
losing
her
money
to
her
nephew
even
though
we
play
for
childishly
low
stakes
she
said
she
knew
that
norton
was
tired
and
emily
did
deny
the
soft
impeachment
as
she
plays
bridge
in
the
same
way
she
would
do
district
visiting
during
an
epidemic
of
measles
because
it
is
her
duty
dick
had
the
latest
french
imitation
of
sherlock
holmes
to
read
and
a
box
of
egyptian
cigarettes
to
smoke
mine
which
he
evidently
thinks
too
young
for
me
emily
had
some
embroidery
which
i
seem
to
remember
that
she
began
when
i
was
a
boy
and
kept
religiously
to
do
in
hotels
but
what
is
there
that
my
good
sister
does
which
she
does
not
do
religiously
senter
had
nothing
to
amuse
or
occupy
her
except
your
humble
servant
consequently
she
suggested
a
stroll
in
the
garden
before
bedtime
she
was
almost
beautiful
in
the
moonlight
quite
and
her
hair
a
nimbus
for
that
small
white
face
of
hers
just
as
small
just
as
white
and
just
as
smooth
as
when
those
big
eyes
used
to
look
up
into
our
eyes
under
an
indian
moon
and
she
is
always
agreeable
always
witty
or
at
least
smart
still
i
must
confess
that
i
was
ungallantly
until
something
she
said
waked
me
up
from
a
brown
study
he
really
a
nice
boy
she
was
saying
and
after
all
it
a
tribute
to
your
distinguished
qualities
that
he
should
be
afraid
to
speak
to
you
i
guessed
at
once
that
she
must
have
been
talking
of
her
nephew
what
is
he
afraid
to
say
to
me
i
enquired
afraid
to
ask
you
for
miss
lethbridge
she
explained
i
think
just
about
that
time
an
ugly
black
eyelid
shut
down
over
the
moon
anyhow
the
world
darkened
for
me
is
it
rather
in
these
rapid
days
for
a
young
man
to
ask
a
guardian
permission
to
make
love
to
his
ward
said
i
savage
as
a
chained
dog
she
laughed
oh
he
has
waited
for
that
to
make
love
i
afraid
she
returned
but
he
afraid
she
wo
accept
him
without
your
consent
he
seems
to
be
afraid
of
several
things
i
growled
afraid
to
speak
to
me
afraid
to
speak
to
her
he
is
young
and
love
has
made
him
modest
senter
excused
her
favourite
he
knows
he
is
a
but
if
they
care
for
each
other
i
have
seen
no
reason
to
believe
that
she
cares
for
him
said
i
thinking
myself
more
or
less
safe
in
the
recollection
of
words
at
winchester
i
told
you
about
them
i
think
ah
well
said
senter
she
cares
enough
anyhow
to
have
entered
into
a
pact
of
some
sort
with
the
poor
boy
a
kind
of
understanding
that
if
approve
she
may
at
least
of
being
engaged
to
him
in
the
future
you
are
sure
she
has
done
that
i
asked
staggered
by
this
statement
which
i
was
far
from
expecting
quite
sure
unless
love
in
the
form
of
dick
is
deaf
as
well
as
blind
he
certainly
flatters
himself
that
they
are
on
these
terms
since
when
i
persisted
by
the
by
i
wonder
if
the
inquisitors
ever
hit
on
the
ingenious
plan
of
making
prisoners
torture
themselves
nothing
hurts
worse
than
only
since
lulworth
cove
or
you
would
have
heard
of
it
before
you
know
when
we
came
back
from
our
walk
and
saw
them
sitting
on
the
beach
together
i
said
what
a
pretty
picture
they
made
naturally
i
remembered
extremely
well
that
was
when
they
had
their
great
scene
dick
begged
me
as
an
old
friend
of
yours
to
say
a
word
when
i
found
the
chance
and
i
confess
i
the
chance
i
do
hope
you
wo
think
me
impertinent
and
interfering
i
fond
of
dick
he
about
all
i
have
to
be
fond
of
in
the
world
and
besides
just
because
i
never
been
happy
myself
i
want
others
to
be
while
they
young
not
to
waste
time
i
muttered
something
i
hardly
know
what
and
she
went
on
to
talk
to
me
of
her
past
for
the
first
time
said
she
had
married
when
little
more
than
a
child
and
had
made
the
mistake
of
marrying
a
man
she
thought
she
could
manage
to
live
happily
with
instead
of
one
she
could
manage
to
live
happily
without
that
was
all
but
it
had
made
the
difference
and
if
miss
lethbridge
had
given
her
first
love
to
dick
i
nearly
said
hang
first
love
but
i
held
my
tongue
fortunately
for
of
course
she
meant
well
and
was
only
doing
her
best
for
her
nephew
but
how
anyone
could
love
that
fellow
passes
my
understanding
why
it
seems
to
me
the
creature
parents
could
hardly
have
loved
him
unless
he
had
had
something
of
the
monstrous
hypnotism
as
well
as
the
selfishness
of
a
young
cuckoo
in
its
stolen
nest
yet
the
same
hypnotism
may
influence
birds
outside
the
nest
i
suppose
that
the
only
way
to
account
for
an
infatuation
on
the
part
of
ellaline
if
you
are
angry
dick
and
i
must
go
away
senter
went
on
but
he
could
help
falling
in
love
and
to
me
they
seem
made
for
each
other
i
had
to
answer
that
of
course
i
was
angry
but
i
thought
any
talk
of
love
premature
to
say
the
least
you
wo
actually
refuse
your
consent
then
asked
she
much
good
my
refusing
would
do
if
the
girl
really
cares
said
i
i
sha
disinherit
her
whatever
she
does
senter
laughed
at
that
why
even
if
you
did
said
she
it
would
matter
greatly
to
them
because
dick
has
something
of
his
own
and
she
is
an
heiress
is
she
then
i
do
know
whether
i
was
wrong
or
not
but
i
swear
i
made
the
answer
i
did
without
any
mean
or
selfish
motives
if
i
can
read
my
own
soul
if
burden
were
a
i
wanted
to
save
her
from
him
that
all
i
told
senter
that
ellaline
had
very
little
money
of
her
own
i
shall
look
after
her
of
course
i
said
but
the
amount
of
the
i
may
give
will
be
determined
by
circumstances
i
do
know
that
i
may
have
put
this
in
a
tactless
way
anyhow
senter
looked
rather
odd
hurt
or
distressed
or
something
queer
i
could
make
quite
out
she
said
nevertheless
that
dick
did
not
care
for
miss
lethbridge
money
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
the
first
time
they
met
nothing
else
mattered
as
they
would
have
enough
to
live
on
but
she
had
supposed
the
girl
almost
too
rich
for
dick
ellaline
a
relation
of
the
millionaire
family
of
lethbridges
she
had
heard
so
i
answered
that
the
relationship
was
distant
that
ellaline
father
had
once
been
a
friend
of
mine
and
that
her
mother
had
been
my
cousin
though
a
french
girl
oh
said
senter
as
if
suddenly
enlightened
is
she
by
any
chance
the
daughter
of
a
lethbridge
what
she
recalled
about
fred
lethbridge
i
ca
guess
she
is
old
enough
to
have
known
him
unless
as
a
child
or
a
very
young
girl
but
she
certainly
had
some
thought
in
connection
with
him
which
made
her
silent
and
reflective
i
hope
i
have
done
ellaline
no
harm
in
case
the
girl
really
does
care
for
burden
i
never
had
the
intention
of
keeping
her
parentage
secret
though
at
the
same
time
it
would
pain
me
to
have
any
gossip
reach
her
however
to
do
senter
justice
i
do
think
she
is
a
gossip
she
likes
to
say
smart
things
but
so
far
as
i
have
heard
she
is
never
smart
at
other
people
expense
and
since
her
confidences
to
me
concerning
her
past
i
am
sorry
for
the
poor
little
woman
not
much
more
passed
between
us
on
the
subject
of
ellaline
and
dick
except
that
i
refused
to
recommend
the
young
man
to
the
girl
good
graces
i
had
to
tell
senter
that
not
even
for
the
pleasure
of
pleasing
her
could
i
consent
to
do
what
she
asked
but
i
did
finally
promise
to
let
ellaline
know
that
personally
i
had
no
objection
to
the
alleged
understanding
if
it
were
for
her
happiness
nevertheless
i
would
advise
her
that
she
must
do
nothing
rash
senter
not
only
permitted
but
actually
suggested
this
extra
clause
and
our
ended
some
things
are
too
strange
not
to
be
true
and
i
suppose
this
infatuation
of
ellaline
if
it
exists
is
one
of
them
and
it
must
exist
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
since
senter
has
it
from
the
boy
who
apparently
has
it
from
the
girl
what
to
make
of
it
however
that
she
told
me
only
about
ten
days
ago
she
did
like
him
yet
i
am
forgetting
we
have
it
on
good
authority
that
is
best
to
begin
with
a
little
aversion
i
ought
to
have
known
that
a
daughter
of
ellaline
de
nesville
and
frederic
lethbridge
could
develop
into
the
being
this
girl
has
seemed
to
me
and
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
that
she
something
less
in
soul
than
in
my
first
burst
of
astonished
admiration
i
was
inclined
to
appraise
her
after
all
why
feel
bitter
against
people
because
they
have
disappointing
shortcomings
if
not
defects
instead
of
the
dazzling
virtues
that
glittered
in
your
imagination
cream
always
rises
to
the
top
yet
we
do
think
less
of
it
because
there
nothing
but
milk
underneath
yes
if
i
find
out
that
she
likes
this
hypnotic
cuckoo
i
must
despise
her
for
it
but
i
must
find
out
as
soon
as
i
can
suspense
is
the
one
unbearable
pain
and
you
are
at
liberty
to
laugh
at
me
as
i
hope
i
shall
soon
be
laughing
at
myself

brendon
to
her
mother
hotel
ma
petite
a
hundred
and
six
and
a
half
thanks
for
your
counsels
and
consolations
i
needed
both
and
not
a
bit
the
less
because
i
not
unhappy
now
i
violently
happy
it
wo
last
but
i
love
it
this
happiness
i
keep
it
sitting
on
my
shoulder
and
stroking
its
wings
so
it
may
remember
when
it
time
to
fly
away
that
letter
i
wrote
you
silly
i
was
a
regular
to
write
it
but
i
so
glad
you
answered
quickly
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
borne
it
if
the
man
at
the
poste
restante
window
had
said
nothing
for
you
miss
i
might
have
responded
with
blows
there
was
a
letter
from
ellaline
too
i
sent
her
the
itinerary
as
far
as
i
knew
it
and
torquay
was
the
last
place
on
the
list
i
was
wondering
if
anything
were
the
matter
but
there
is
though
there
news
she
waited
to
write
she
says
so
that
her
plans
might
be
decided
and
she
could
tell
them
to
me
the
military
manoeuvres
go
on
and
the
news
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
the
adored
honoré
but
ellaline
has
made
a
confidante
a
scotch
girl
she
has
met
i
do
mean
she
told
everything
far
from
that
apparently
she
has
kept
the
fraudulent
part
about
me
secret
and
only
confided
the
romantic
part
about
herself
what
she
says
she
has
told
is
that
she
run
away
from
cruel
persons
who
want
to
have
all
her
money
and
to
prevent
her
from
having
any
happiness
that
she
hiding
till
the
man
she
engaged
to
can
take
her
to
scotland
and
have
a
scotch
marriage
at
gretna
green
if
possible
because
it
would
be
romantic
and
her
mother
was
married
there
the
scotch
girl
with
northern
coldness
of
reason
has
pointed
out
that
gretna
green
is
nowadays
like
any
other
place
but
ellaline
is
not
weaned
from
the
idea
she
appears
to
have
fascinated
her
new
friend
as
she
did
her
old
ones
in
spite
of
the
northern
coldness
and
has
received
a
pressing
invitation
to
visit
at
the
girl
house
in
scotland
until
honoré
can
claim
her
there
is
a
mother
as
well
as
a
girl
but
only
a
stepmother
and
apparently
a
detail
for
the
girl
has
the
money
and
the
strength
of
will
the
two
are
stopping
in
a
pension
near
madame
de
house
the
girl
is
a
miss
mcnamarra
with
freckles
and
no
figure
but
engaged
to
an
officer
and
consequently
sympathetic
she
has
advised
ellaline
that
if
she
travels
from
france
to
scotland
with
honoré
on
the
way
to
be
married
he
may
respect
her
as
much
as
if
she
had
friends
and
chaperons
and
a
nice
place
to
wait
for
him
ellaline
is
too
french
at
heart
not
to
feel
that
this
advice
is
good
though
she
adds
in
her
letter
that
she
of
course
trusts
darling
honoré
completely
so
she
has
accepted
the
invitation
the
only
trouble
is
she
wants
more
money
at
once
she
must
let
golden
louis
run
through
her
fingers
like
water
for
i
sent
her
nearly
all
sir
lionel
handed
me
before
we
started
on
the
trip
i
shall
have
to
ask
him
for
more
and
i
hate
doing
that
because
though
i
shall
be
gone
out
of
his
life
so
soon
i
too
vain
and
it
must
be
that
to
like
making
a
bad
impression
on
his
mind
while
we
together
i
sha
hate
it
as
much
however
as
i
should
supposing
that
something
which
happened
last
night
happened
i
coming
to
that
part
presently
it
the
thing
that
made
me
happy
the
thing
that
last
long
we
left
adorable
little
sidmouth
days
ago
i
almost
forget
how
many
coming
as
far
as
exeter
along
a
lovely
road
but
then
everything
is
lovely
in
devonshire
it
is
almost
more
beautiful
than
the
new
forest
only
so
different
that
thank
goodness
it
is
necessary
to
compare
the
two
kinds
of
scenery
perhaps
devonshire
stripped
of
its
bold
red
rocks
drained
of
its
brilliant
blue
sea
and
despoiled
of
its
dark
moors
might
be
too
sugary
sweet
with
its
cottages
and
lanes
like
conservatories
but
it
is
so
well
balanced
with
its
intimate
sweetnesses
and
its
noble
outlines
i
think
are
rather
like
devonshire
you
so
perfect
and
you
are
the
most
person
i
was
ever
introduced
to
except
dad
i
proud
that
his
ancestors
were
devonshire
men
and
oh
the
junket
and
devonshire
cream
are
even
better
than
he
used
to
tell
me
i
have
tasted
the
cider
yet
because
i
bear
to
miss
the
cream
at
any
meal
and
the
chambermaid
at
sidmouth
warned
me
that
they
did
mix
bits
of
devonshire
are
like
italy
i
find
not
only
is
the
earth
deep
red
in
the
meadows
where
the
farmers
have
torn
open
its
green
coat
and
many
of
the
roads
a
pale
dust
and
all
but
lots
of
houses
and
cottages
are
pink
a
real
italian
pink
so
that
whole
villages
blush
as
you
look
them
in
the
face
sometimes
too
there
a
blue
or
a
green
or
a
house
here
and
there
a
high
broken
wall
of
rose
or
faded
yellow
with
torrential
geraniums
boiling
over
the
top
and
the
effect
of
this
riot
of
colour
in
contrast
with
the
silver
gray
of
the
velvety
thatch
or
slate
roofs
under
great
cool
trees
is
even
more
beautiful
than
italy
if
all
england
is
a
park
devonshire
is
a
queen
garden
from
sidmouth
we
went
to
budleigh
salterton
why
either
but
especially
both
quaintly
pretty
and
rather
with
its
miniature
bridges
and
canal
then
to
exmouth
with
its
flowering
front
its
tiny
maison
carrée
which
would
remind
one
more
of
nîmes
if
it
had
no
bay
windows
and
its
exquisite
view
across
silver
river
and
purple
hills
that
ripple
away
into
faint
lilac
shadows
in
the
distance
then
we
struck
inland
to
exeter
and
at
exeter
we
stopped
two
days
in
the
very
oldest
and
queerest
but
nicest
hotel
imaginable
i
was
so
very
happy
there
because
the
thing
i
going
to
tell
you
about
in
good
time
had
happened
yet
but
i
not
sure
that
i
more
in
tune
with
exeter
than
if
i
had
been
as
happy
as
i
am
now
the
scenery
here
suits
my
joyous
mood
and
the
grave
tranquillity
of
the
beautiful
old
cathedral
town
calmed
my
spirit
when
i
needed
calm
i
given
up
expecting
to
love
any
other
cathedral
as
i
loved
winchester
chichester
i
half
forgotten
already
except
some
of
the
tombs
salisbury
was
far
more
beautiful
far
more
impressive
in
its
proportions
than
winchester
yet
to
me
not
so
impressive
in
other
ways
and
exeter
cathedral
struck
me
at
first
sight
as
curiously
low
almost
squat
but
as
soon
as
i
lived
down
the
first
surprise
of
that
effect
i
began
to
love
it
the
stone
of
which
the
cathedral
is
built
may
be
cold
and
gray
but
time
and
carvings
have
made
it
solemn
not
depressing
i
stood
a
long
time
looking
up
at
the
west
front
not
saying
a
word
but
something
in
me
was
singing
a
te
deum
and
how
you
would
love
the
windows
you
used
always
to
say
when
we
were
in
italy
and
france
that
it
was
beautiful
windows
which
made
you
love
a
cathedral
or
church
as
beautiful
eyes
make
one
love
a
face
this
cathedral
has
unforgettable
eyes
and
a
tremendously
long
history
beginning
as
far
back
as
nine
hundred
and
something
when
athelstan
came
to
exeter
and
drove
out
the
poor
british
who
thought
it
was
theirs
he
built
towns
founded
a
monastery
in
honour
of
saint
mary
and
saint
peter
not
having
time
i
suppose
to
do
one
for
each
and
afterward
the
monastery
decided
that
it
would
be
a
cathedral
instead
but
two
hundred
and
more
years
earlier
that
disagreeable
boniface
who
disliked
the
celts
so
much
went
to
a
saxon
school
in
exeter
i
wonder
what
going
to
school
was
like
when
all
the
world
was
young
i
wandered
into
the
cathedral
both
mornings
to
hear
the
music
and
something
about
the
dim
moonlit
look
of
the
interior
made
me
feel
you
will
say
that
rather
a
change
for
me
perhaps
because
you
tell
me
reproachfully
sometimes
after
i
thought
about
the
hats
and
the
backs
of
their
blouses
in
church
that
i
have
only
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
religion
i
do
know
whether
i
may
be
doing
the
most
dreadful
wrong
every
minute
by
pretending
to
be
ellaline
but
it
was
for
a
good
purpose
as
you
know
and
you
yourself
consented
and
though
i
have
twinges
sometimes
i
did
feel
good
at
exeter
oh
it
did
me
heaps
of
good
to
good
you
have
to
live
up
to
your
feelings
if
you
feel
like
that
and
i
prayed
in
the
cathedral
i
prayed
to
be
happy
is
that
a
wrong
note
for
a
prayer
i
do
believe
it
is
if
it
rings
true
anyway
it
makes
me
feel
young
and
strong
to
pray
like
achilles
after
he
rolled
on
the
earth
and
i
do
feel
so
young
and
strong
just
now
dear
i
have
to
sing
in
my
bath
and
when
i
look
out
of
the
window
also
sometimes
when
i
look
in
the
glass
for
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
growing
brighter
and
prettier
i
love
to
be
pretty
because
it
such
a
beautiful
world
and
to
be
pretty
is
to
be
in
the
harmony
of
it
though
perhaps
only
perhaps
mind
i
glad
i
not
a
regular
beauty
it
would
be
such
a
responsibility
in
the
matter
of
wearing
one
clothes
and
doing
hair
and
never
getting
tanned
or
chapped
and
i
love
to
be
thin
and
alive
alive
with
my
soul
in
proportion
to
my
body
like
a
hand
in
a
glove
not
like
a
seed
in
a
big
apple
but
is
this
funny
talk
in
the
midst
of
describing
exeter
it
because
of
the
reaction
from
misery
to
ecstasy
that
i
so
bubbly
i
ca
stop
but
luckily
it
did
come
on
in
exeter
because
the
delightful
queer
old
streets
are
at
all
suitable
to
bubble
in
it
impertinent
to
be
excessively
young
there
especially
in
the
beautiful
cathedral
close
where
it
is
so
calm
and
dignified
and
the
rooks
who
are
very
very
old
do
nothing
but
caw
about
their
ancestors
i
think
some
curates
ought
to
turn
into
rooks
when
they
die
they
would
be
quite
happy
our
hotel
as
i
said
was
fascinating
though
norton
fell
once
or
twice
as
there
were
steps
up
and
down
everywhere
and
dick
bumped
his
forehead
on
a
door
i
was
at
all
sorry
for
him
senter
said
if
we
stopped
long
she
would
have
got
cottage
walk
and
as
she
already
had
face
and
bridge
eye
she
thought
the
combination
would
be
if
she
were
dick
aunt
and
if
she
were
so
determined
to
flirt
with
sir
lionel
without
his
knowing
what
she
at
and
if
she
did
make
little
cutting
speeches
to
me
when
he
listening
i
think
i
should
find
her
amusing
the
only
things
i
did
like
at
the
hotel
were
the
eggs
which
looked
so
nice
quite
brown
and
dated
the
morning
you
had
them
on
their
shells
but
tasting
mediæval
i
wonder
if
eggs
can
be
like
cheques
as
for
the
other
eatables
there
was
very
little
taste
in
them
mediæval
or
otherwise
i
do
think
for
instance
ought
to
taste
like
something
if
it
only
hair
oil
and
the
head
waiter
had
such
hair
i
never
got
a
talk
alone
with
sir
lionel
in
exeter
because
though
he
tried
once
or
twice
with
the
air
of
having
a
painful
duty
to
accomplish
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
ask
me
about
dick
and
i
just
felt
i
could
bear
it
so
avoided
him
or
instantly
tacked
myself
on
to
emily
or
someone
i
think
emily
approves
of
my
running
to
her
whenever
threatened
by
man
society
because
she
thinks
the
instinctive
desire
to
be
protected
from
anything
male
is
pretty
and
maidenly
she
certainly
belongs
to
the
stone
age
in
some
of
her
ideas
though
her
maxims
are
of
a
later
period
many
of
them
she
draws
and
quarters
from
the
scriptures
at
least
she
attributes
them
to
the
scriptures
but
i
know
some
of
them
to
be
in
shakespeare
lots
of
people
seem
to
make
that
mistake
of
course
in
the
car
i
never
talk
to
sir
lionel
except
a
word
flung
over
shoulders
now
and
then
for
senter
sits
by
him
she
asked
to
did
i
tell
you
that
before
so
the
day
we
left
exeter
things
were
just
the
same
between
us
not
trustful
and
silently
happy
as
at
the
time
of
the
but
rather
strained
and
vaguely
official
it
had
rained
a
little
in
exeter
but
the
sky
and
landscape
were
and
sparkling
as
we
sailed
over
the
pink
road
past
charming
little
starcross
with
its
big
and
baby
past
dawlish
of
the
crimson
cliffs
and
deep
deep
blue
sea
if
i
were
a
bluer
just
as
good
a
word
as
brewer
i
would
buy
dawlish
as
an
advertisement
for
my
blue
it
seems
made
for
that
by
nature
and
is
so
brilliant
you
never
believe
it
was
true
on
a
poster
down
a
toboggan
slide
of
a
hill
into
teignmouth
another
by
the
sea
and
through
one
of
england
many
newtons
newton
abbot
this
time
to
torquay
as
we
had
left
exeter
until
after
luncheon
it
was
evening
when
we
arrived
but
that
sir
lionel
said
was
what
he
wanted
on
account
of
the
lights
in
and
on
and
above
the
water
which
he
wanted
us
to
see
as
we
came
to
the
town
he
has
been
here
before
long
ago
as
he
has
been
at
most
of
the
places
but
he
says
that
he
enjoys
and
appreciates
everything
more
now
than
he
did
the
first
time
it
was
like
a
dream
a
dream
all
the
way
from
newton
abbot
where
sunset
began
to
turn
the
silver
streak
of
river
in
the
valley
red
as
wine
there
was
just
one
ugly
interval
the
long
dull
street
by
which
we
entered
torquay
with
its
tearing
trams
and
common
shops
but
out
of
it
we
came
suddenly
into
a
scene
of
enchantment
that
really
is
too
enthusiastic
a
description
for
in
front
of
us
lay
the
harbour
the
water
violet
flecked
with
gold
the
sky
blazing
still
to
the
zenith
where
the
moon
drenched
the
fire
with
a
silver
flood
the
hills
were
deeper
violet
than
the
sea
sparkling
with
lights
that
sprang
out
of
the
twilight
and
on
the
smooth
water
a
hundred
little
white
boats
danced
over
their
own
reflections
we
begged
sir
lionel
not
to
let
young
nick
light
our
lamps
for
they
are
so
fierce
and
powerful
they
swallow
up
the
beauty
of
the
evening
but
i
do
think
where
there
are
lots
of
motors
about
it
would
be
nice
if
had
to
be
lighted
at
night
and
especially
dogs
now
at
last
i
have
come
to
the
thing
the
thing
that
makes
me
happy
with
a
happiness
all
the
more
vivid
because
it
ca
last
but
even
if
i
fall
to
the
depths
of
misery
once
more
i
sha
be
a
coward
and
moan
to
you
it
must
be
horrid
to
get
letter
after
letter
full
of
wails
i
do
see
how
mademoiselle
julie
de
lespinasse
could
write
the
letters
she
did
and
i
ca
much
blame
monsieur
de
guibert
for
dreading
to
read
them
always
in
the
same
key
and
on
the
same
note
i
suffer
i
suffer
i
want
to
die
well
i
kept
you
waiting
long
enough
or
have
you
perhaps
read
ahead
i
should
in
your
place
though
i
hope
have
we
came
to
the
osborne
because
sir
lionel
knew
and
liked
it
though
there
another
hotel
grander
and
we
usually
go
to
the
grandest
so
odd
that
feels
after
our
travels
yours
and
mine
when
our
thought
was
to
search
out
the
cheapest
place
in
any
town
and
the
osborne
has
a
terraced
garden
which
runs
down
and
down
the
cliffs
toward
the
sea
with
a
most
alluring
view
senter
had
luggage
come
to
meet
her
here
and
she
appeared
at
dinner
in
our
private
looking
quite
startlingly
handsome
in
a
black
chiffon
dress
embroidered
in
pale
gold
exactly
the
colour
of
her
hair
the
weather
had
turned
rather
cold
however
since
the
rain
at
exeter
so
gorgeous
as
the
moonlight
was
she
wanted
to
stop
indoors
after
dinner
and
proposed
bridge
as
usual
that
was
the
signal
for
me
to
slip
away
i
finished
lorna
doone
which
is
the
loveliest
love
story
in
the
english
language
except
part
of
richard
feverel
so
i
thought
i
would
go
into
the
garden
i
felt
moderately
secure
from
dick
because
even
if
he
really
in
love
with
me
he
is
as
much
in
love
with
bridge
and
besides
he
afraid
of
his
aunt
for
some
reason
or
other
as
for
sir
lionel
it
did
occur
to
me
that
he
might
even
to
come
i
strolled
about
at
first
not
far
from
the
hotel
then
i
was
tempted
farther
and
farther
down
the
cliff
path
until
i
found
a
thatched
where
i
sat
and
thought
what
a
splendid
ornamental
world
it
would
be
to
live
in
if
one
were
happy
by
this
time
the
sky
and
sea
were
bathed
in
moonlight
the
stone
pines
so
like
italian
pines
black
against
a
silver
haze
in
the
dark
water
the
path
of
the
moon
lay
very
broad
and
long
all
made
of
great
flakes
of
thick
deep
gold
as
if
the
sea
were
paved
with
golden
scales
it
was
so
lovely
it
saddened
me
but
i
did
want
to
go
indoors
and
presently
i
heard
footsteps
on
the
path
i
was
afraid
it
was
dick
after
all
as
he
is
horribly
clever
about
finding
out
where
one
has
gone
so
detectivey
of
him
but
in
another
second
i
smelt
sir
lionel
kind
of
cigarette
smoke
it
would
make
me
think
of
him
if
it
were
a
hundred
years
from
now
still
dick
borrows
his
cigarettes
often
as
he
says
they
too
expensive
to
buy
so
i
was
safe
indeed
it
turned
out
to
be
i
was
safe
because
one
might
be
silly
and
the
other
might
scold
but
it
was
sir
lionel
and
he
saw
me
although
i
made
myself
little
and
stood
in
the
shadow
not
daring
to
sit
down
again
because
the
seat
squeaked
are
you
cold
he
asked
i
answered
that
i
was
quite
warm
then
he
said
that
it
was
a
nice
night
and
we
talked
about
the
weather
and
all
that
idiotic
sort
of
thing
which
means
empty
brains
or
hearts
too
full
by
and
by
when
i
was
beginning
to
feel
as
though
i
should
scream
if
it
went
on
much
longer
he
stopped
suddenly
in
a
conversation
about
fresh
fish
and
said
ellaline
i
think
i
must
speak
of
something
that
been
on
my
mind
for
some
days
he
never
called
me
ellaline
before
but
only
you
and
this
gave
me
rather
a
start
to
begin
with
so
i
said
nothing
and
as
it
turned
out
that
was
probably
the
best
thing
i
could
have
done
if
i
said
anything
it
would
have
been
the
wrong
thing
and
then
perhaps
we
should
have
started
off
with
a
misunderstanding
i
should
hate
to
have
you
think
me
unsympathetic
he
went
on
not
but
do
you
want
to
marry
dick
burden
some
day
if
he
put
it
differently
i
might
have
hesitated
what
to
answer
for
i
afraid
of
dick
there
no
use
denying
it
of
course
mostly
on
ellaline
account
but
a
little
on
my
own
too
because
i
a
coward
and
do
want
to
be
disgraced
as
it
was
i
hesitate
for
the
thought
of
marrying
dick
burden
would
have
been
insupportable
if
it
had
been
ridiculous
so
you
see
i
forgot
to
dread
what
dick
might
do
if
he
heard
and
just
blurted
out
the
truth
i
sooner
go
into
a
convent
said
i
you
mean
that
sir
lionel
pinned
me
down
i
do
i
repeated
could
you
imagine
a
girl
wanting
to
marry
dick
burden
no
could
said
sir
lionel
and
then
he
laughed
such
a
nice
happy
laugh
like
a
boy
quite
different
from
the
way
i
have
heard
him
laugh
lately
though
at
first
in
london
he
seemed
young
and
but
i
no
judge
of
the
men
or
boys
a
girl
might
want
to
marry
dick
or
near
it
yes
i
admitted
so
is
your
little
chauffeur
but
i
do
want
to
marry
it
are
you
flirting
with
dick
then
sir
lionel
asked
not
sharply
but
almost
wistfully
i
could
stand
that
i
had
to
tell
the
truth
no
matter
for
i
not
flirting
with
him
either
i
said
what
then
nothing
but
he
seems
to
think
there
is
something
something
to
hope
did
he
tell
you
so
no
he
sent
me
word
oh
words
get
mixed
when
they
sent
he
i
not
flirting
with
him
does
he
know
forgive
me
does
he
know
that
you
do
love
him
a
little
he
knows
i
do
love
him
at
all
then
i
ca
understand
said
sir
lionel
would
you
like
me
to
love
him
i
could
help
asking
no
he
began
and
stopped
i
should
like
you
to
be
happy
in
your
own
way
he
went
on
more
slowly
i
been
at
a
loss
because
a
little
while
ago
you
said
you
did
like
burden
and
then
you
seemed
to
change
your
mind
it
was
only
seeming
i
continued
on
my
reckless
course
my
mind
toward
him
stands
where
it
did
if
that
is
so
what
have
you
done
to
him
to
give
him
hope
nothing
i
could
help
i
said
there
a
strange
misunderstanding
somewhere
apparently
sir
lionel
reflected
aloud
oh
do
let
there
be
one
between
us
i
begged
looking
up
at
him
suddenly
he
put
his
hand
out
as
suddenly
and
grabbed
literally
grabbed
mine
i
was
so
happy
is
it
nice
that
men
are
so
much
stronger
than
women
and
that
we
meant
to
like
them
to
be
it
can
make
life
so
interesting
as
his
fingers
pressed
mine
i
let
mine
press
his
too
and
felt
we
were
friends
by
jove
no
we
wo
he
said
and
though
it
was
much
to
say
nothing
could
have
pleased
me
better
the
words
and
the
tone
seemed
to
match
the
close
clasp
of
our
hands
would
you
be
willing
to
trust
me
i
asked
of
course
but
in
what
way
do
you
mean
about
dick
burden
he
think
i
flirting
and
he
think
i
care
for
him
yet
i
want
you
to
trust
me
and
not
say
anything
to
him
or
to
his
aunt
let
dick
and
me
fight
it
out
between
us
he
laughed
again
with
all
my
heart
if
you
want
to
fight
but
i
have
you
annoyed
if
he
annoys
you
he
must
go
i
will
get
rid
of
him
dick
ca
annoy
me
if
he
does
make
trouble
for
me
with
you
sir
lionel
i
said
and
that
was
the
truth
only
if
you
just
trust
me
to
manage
him
you
very
young
to
undertake
the
management
of
a
man
dick
is
a
man
he
a
boy
and
you
are
a
child
i
may
seem
a
child
to
you
i
said
but
i
not
i
be
so
happy
and
i
thank
you
so
much
if
you
just
let
things
go
on
as
they
are
for
a
little
while
you
be
glad
afterward
if
you
do
and
he
will
when
i
gone
and
ellaline
has
come
he
will
be
glad
he
did
give
himself
too
much
trouble
on
my
account
but
i
not
going
to
think
now
of
what
his
opinion
of
me
may
be
at
present
he
has
a
very
good
kind
opinion
even
though
i
am
a
child
in
his
eyes
i
am
a
dear
child
and
though
it
ca
last
it
does
make
me
happy
to
be
dear
to
him
in
any
way
at
all
this
terrible
dragon
of
ellaline
but
that
is
the
end
of
our
conversation
the
real
end
was
an
perhaps
but
i
liked
it
for
that
matter
the
tail
of
a
comet
an
it
was
only
that
when
we
talked
on
and
he
promised
to
trust
me
and
leave
the
reins
in
my
hands
while
he
attended
solely
to
the
steering
of
his
i
said
now
we
must
go
in
senter
will
be
wanting
to
finish
her
rubber
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
he
explained
she
had
a
telegram
and
had
been
obliged
to
hurry
and
write
a
letter
to
catch
the
last
post
that
had
stopped
a
game
in
the
middle
oh
hang
it
all
i
suppose
she
will
he
grumbled
more
to
himself
than
to
me
because
if
he
paused
to
think
he
would
have
been
too
polite
to
express
himself
so
about
a
guest
whatever
his
feelings
were
but
that
why
i
was
pleased
he
spoke
impulsively
without
thinking
it
a
triumph
that
he
would
rather
have
stayed
there
in
the
garden
even
with
a
child
than
hurry
back
to
that
radiant
and
black
vision
now
you
know
why
i
am
so
pleased
with
life
all
that
happened
last
night
and
we
have
had
excursions
but
no
alarums
we
every
one
not
just
he
and
i
have
been
to
cavern
where
prehistoric
tigers
teeth
grinned
at
us
from
the
walls
and
have
taken
a
walk
to
babbicombe
bay
where
we
had
tea
i
think
it
was
the
loveliest
path
i
ever
saw
that
cliff
way
with
the
gray
rocks
and
the
blue
sea
into
which
the
sky
had
emptied
itself
like
a
cup
with
a
silver
rim
and
the
wild
flowers
the
little
dainty
daisies
which
i
could
bear
to
crush
and
the
larks
that
sprang
out
of
the
grass
there
are
things
that
make
you
feel
so
at
in
england
dear
i
think
it
is
like
no
other
country
for
that
we
are
to
motor
to
princetown
on
dartmoor
eden
phillpotts
land
and
are
coming
back
to
torquay
at
night
if
i
have
time
i
write
you
a
special
dartmoor
letter
for
i
have
an
idea
that
i
shall
find
the
moor
wonderfully
impressive
but
we
may
get
back
till
late
and
the
day
after
we
are
to
start
early
in
the
morning
for
sir
lionel
county
cornwall
afterward
we
shall
come
back
into
another
part
of
devonshire
and
see
bideford
and
exmoor
that
why
i
been
able
to
forget
some
of
my
worries
in
westward
ho
and
lorna
doone
lately
but
sir
lionel
ca
wait
longer
for
cornwall
and
so
night
my
eyes
shall
look
upon
only
think
of
it
dark
tintagel
by
the
cornish
sea
that
is
we
shall
see
it
apollo
permitting
for
motors
and
men
gang
aft
aglee
this
is
apropos
of
apollo
usual
behaviour
but
of
the
stories
been
told
concerning
dartmoor
roads
they
say
well
there
nothing
to
worry
about
with
sir
lionel
at
the
helm
but
i
should
wonder
if
will
be
an
adventure
there
now
i
sorry
i
said
that
you
may
be
anxious
but
i
scratch
it
out
and
it
nearly
at
the
bottom
of
a
big
sheet
so
i
wire
night
when
we
get
back
and
you
have
the
telegram
before
you
have
this
letter
your
but
ever
loving
audrie
xvi
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
torquay
ten
dearest
i
thought
the
moor
would
be
impressive
it
is
overwhelming
oh
this
devonshire
of
my
father
people
is
far
from
being
all
a
land
of
cream
and
roses
dartmoor
has
given
me
so
many
emotions
that
i
am
tired
but
i
must
tell
you
about
it
and
them
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
see
tors
like
ruined
against
the
sky
and
i
see
princetown
grim
and
terrible
no
country
can
look
its
best
on
a
map
no
matter
what
colour
be
chosen
to
express
it
but
i
did
like
dartmoor
rich
brown
which
set
it
apart
from
the
green
parts
of
devonshire
it
took
some
time
though
even
in
a
motor
to
come
to
the
brown
for
our
road
was
as
far
as
holne
charles
kingsley
birthplace
we
got
out
there
of
course
and
looked
at
his
memorial
window
in
the
charming
village
church
at
holne
bridge
i
thought
of
the
beautiful
way
to
the
grande
chartreuse
so
you
can
imagine
it
was
far
from
sterile
although
we
were
on
the
fringe
of
the
moor
and
ah
what
a
lovely
green
fringe
the
brown
moor
wears
it
is
all
trimmed
round
the
edge
with
woods
and
glens
where
the
baby
river
dart
goes
laughing
by
and
there
a
most
romantic
lover
leap
of
course
strange
how
so
many
lovers
though
of
different
countries
have
all
that
same
wild
desire
to
jump
off
something
if
i
were
a
lover
i
should
much
rather
die
a
flat
neat
death
we
saw
this
lover
leap
only
at
a
distance
when
going
toward
the
moor
but
coming
back
however
i
will
tell
you
about
it
afterward
when
i
come
to
buckland
chase
on
the
way
home
it
was
at
holne
that
the
big
hills
of
which
we
been
warned
began
but
apollo
merely
sniffs
at
gradients
that
make
smaller
meaner
motors
grunt
with
rage
we
had
a
car
behind
us
which
had
started
ahead
but
it
was
rather
an
ominous
sign
to
see
no
pneu
tracks
in
the
white
dust
of
the
road
as
we
travelled
other
days
we
have
always
had
them
to
follow
and
it
makes
a
motor
feel
at
home
to
know
that
his
brethren
have
come
and
gone
that
way
this
must
have
seemed
to
apollo
like
isolation
and
as
if
to
emphasize
the
sensation
which
we
all
shared
suddenly
we
began
to
the
moor
i
ca
describe
to
you
exactly
what
that
smell
was
like
but
we
it
was
the
moor
the
air
became
alive
and
it
tingled
with
a
cold
breath
of
the
north
and
one
thought
of
granite
with
the
sun
on
it
and
broom
in
blossom
and
coarse
grass
such
as
love
though
one
saw
none
of
those
things
yet
the
scenery
was
still
gentle
and
friendly
and
the
baby
dart
was
singing
at
the
top
of
its
voice
really
it
was
almost
a
tune
i
felt
as
i
listened
that
it
would
be
easy
to
set
it
to
music
the
stones
round
which
purled
the
clear
water
looked
like
the
whole
notes
and
half
notes
all
ready
to
be
pushed
into
place
so
that
the
tune
might
arrange
itself
and
the
amber
brown
of
the
stream
was
mottled
with
gold
under
the
surface
as
if
a
sack
full
of
sovereigns
had
been
emptied
into
the
river
the
first
tor
on
our
horizon
was
sharp
tor
which
the
dart
evidently
feared
the
poor
little
river
disappeared
at
sight
of
it
hurrying
away
from
its
frown
and
as
the
stream
vanished
all
the
dainty
charm
of
the
landscape
fled
too
we
saw
the
moor
towering
toward
us
stern
and
barren
with
that
great
of
nature
pinning
it
to
the
sky
moorland
ponies
raced
to
and
fro
mad
with
the
joy
of
some
game
they
were
playing
and
they
were
not
afraid
of
us
i
should
think
the
live
things
of
the
moor
were
afraid
of
nothing
that
could
come
to
them
out
of
the
world
beyond
for
that
pungent
air
breathes
courage
and
the
gray
granite
breaking
through
the
poor
coat
of
grass
dares
the
eyes
that
look
at
it
not
to
be
brave
near
the
moorland
ponies
on
holne
moor
we
came
to
the
strangest
reservoir
you
could
dream
of
it
was
vast
and
blue
as
a
block
fallen
out
of
the
sky
and
once
sir
lionel
said
it
had
been
a
lake
though
now
it
gives
water
to
the
prison
town
an
old
road
used
to
run
through
it
and
to
this
day
you
can
see
the
bridge
under
water
the
story
is
that
strange
forms
cross
that
bridge
at
night
i
sure
it
true
for
anything
could
happen
on
the
moor
and
of
course
it
swarms
with
pixies
you
believe
that
do
you
well
anyway
you
would
if
you
saw
the
moor
the
next
tor
was
nameless
for
us
but
it
was
even
finer
than
sharp
tor
after
seeing
stonehenge
i
felt
so
certain
it
must
be
druidical
that
it
was
disappointing
to
hear
it
was
that
all
such
theories
about
the
tors
had
exploded
afterward
there
were
lots
of
tors
and
there
were
tin
mines
too
not
far
from
our
wild
desolate
road
tin
mines
that
have
always
been
worked
they
say
since
the
days
of
the
phoenicians
i
should
have
been
more
interested
in
thinking
about
them
however
if
we
had
just
then
begun
gliding
down
a
hill
which
from
the
top
looked
as
if
it
might
go
straight
through
to
china
my
toes
felt
as
if
they
been
done
up
in
for
years
but
there
was
a
savage
joy
in
the
creepiness
of
it
and
apollo
sturdily
down
in
a
nice
dependable
way
toward
a
lonely
village
which
i
felt
sure
was
entirely
populated
by
eden
phillpotts
people
he
and
the
other
authors
who
write
about
the
moor
invariably
make
their
leading
characters
have
primitive
passions
so
i
thought
perhaps
the
faces
of
the
moor
folk
would
be
wilder
and
stranger
and
have
more
meaning
than
other
civilized
faces
but
all
those
i
saw
looked
just
like
everybody
else
and
i
was
so
disappointed
they
even
dropped
their
h
and
once
when
we
stopped
a
moment
at
a
place
where
sir
lionel
was
sure
of
the
way
i
asked
a
boy
on
a
rough
pony
the
names
of
some
trees
we
had
passed
and
green
miss
said
he
it
a
blow
toward
eleven
the
sun
had
drunk
up
the
cold
mist
and
the
moor
basked
in
heat
we
were
in
an
empty
world
save
for
a
cottage
now
and
then
and
a
cyclopean
wall
of
stones
loosely
piled
one
upon
another
yet
this
was
the
main
road
from
ashburton
to
princetown
apollo
glided
along
a
desolate
white
way
between
creamy
and
silver
grasses
artistically
intermingled
and
burning
golden
gorse
which
caught
the
sun
the
splendid
dignified
loneliness
of
the
moor
was
like
the
retreat
chosen
by
a
hermit
god
there
may
be
only
twenty
square
miles
of
moor
but
it
feels
like
a
hundred
hexworthy
and
the
forest
inn
which
we
came
to
in
a
valley
were
curiously
swiss
all
but
the
ancient
cross
which
made
me
think
of
eden
phillpotts
american
prisoner
how
can
i
say
an
ancient
cross
though
when
the
old
things
on
the
moor
began
not
only
before
christ
but
before
history
the
stone
circles
the
cairns
and
the
cromlechs
the
kistvaen
and
the
barrows
the
hut
circles
where
a
forgotten
people
used
to
live
are
strewn
in
thousands
over
the
moor
and
cooking
utensils
are
sometimes
dug
up
even
now
so
you
see
everything
is
discovered
yet
the
people
had
any
metal
to
work
with
poor
creatures
until
the
bronze
age
and
they
clothed
themselves
in
skins
which
i
suppose
their
dressmakers
and
tailors
made
when
the
sheep
and
cows
that
wore
them
first
had
been
cut
up
and
eaten
i
wonder
if
girls
were
pretty
in
those
days
or
men
handsome
and
if
anyone
cared
but
i
suppose
knowing
the
difference
between
ugliness
and
beauty
is
as
old
as
adam
and
eve
if
eve
had
been
pretty
adam
would
have
looked
at
her
but
would
have
waited
in
the
hope
of
something
better
the
first
sight
of
princetown
only
intensified
the
loneliness
of
the
moor
somehow
partly
because
it
loomed
so
gray
and
grim
partly
perhaps
because
we
knew
it
to
be
a
prison
town
the
dark
buildings
looked
as
much
a
natural
growth
of
the
moor
as
those
ruined
temples
on
the
horizon
which
were
tors
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
plymouth
was
only
fifteen
miles
away
and
the
sombreness
and
gloom
of
the
melancholy
place
increased
instead
of
diminished
as
we
drew
nearer
to
it
after
leaving
behind
us
the
pleasant
oasis
of
tor
bridge
and
its
little
hotel
that
anglers
and
walkers
love
the
prison
settlement
was
stuck
like
a
black
in
the
midst
of
wide
purity
gloom
hung
over
it
in
a
pall
and
stole
the
warmth
from
the
sunshine
what
a
town
to
name
after
a
prince
regent
and
what
a
town
to
have
lunch
in
yet
it
was
a
singularly
good
lunch
we
ate
it
in
a
hotel
built
of
gray
stone
with
gray
stone
colonnades
which
looked
like
an
annex
to
the
prison
there
was
meat
pie
which
one
expected
to
find
smoking
hot
and
it
gave
quite
a
shock
to
find
it
not
only
cold
but
iced
there
was
a
big
cool
all
mysterious
creeping
shadows
and
queer
echoes
when
one
dared
to
speak
and
unless
one
did
speak
the
silence
sent
a
chill
through
one
body
but
it
was
an
interesting
chill
certainly
the
hotel
was
the
strangest
i
ever
saw
and
the
hotel
dog
was
like
no
other
animal
on
land
or
sea
he
appeared
to
be
a
mixture
of
brindled
bull
and
irish
terrier
with
long
on
a
face
he
was
a
nightmare
but
he
loved
devonshire
cream
and
junket
and
ate
them
as
if
he
were
a
lamb
we
stayed
a
long
time
in
princetown
and
then
started
to
go
home
by
a
different
way
out
of
a
vast
moorland
tract
we
descended
to
dartmoor
bridge
the
prettiest
oasis
in
the
wild
desert
of
moor
which
we
had
seen
yet
but
soon
we
were
back
in
moorland
again
with
tors
rising
up
to
snatch
at
heaven
with
their
dark
claws
each
one
seemed
different
from
all
the
rest
just
as
people
faces
are
different
in
crowds
some
were
like
crests
of
waves
petrified
as
they
were
ready
to
break
but
the
weirdest
of
all
were
exactly
like
ruined
forts
of
dwarfs
and
presently
the
scenery
changed
again
in
a
kaleidoscopic
way
we
came
to
lovely
houndsgate
with
a
great
deep
far
below
us
only
to
return
to
a
region
of
tors
and
bracken
and
to
plunge
down
the
most
tremendous
hill
of
all
a
hill
which
was
like
gliding
down
the
glassy
side
of
an
ocean
wave
i
had
just
exclaimed
see
there
a
motor
ahead
of
us
when
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
the
car
going
before
us
very
fast
suddenly
ran
to
the
side
of
the
steep
road
stopped
some
people
jumped
out
and
at
the
same
instant
a
great
flame
spouted
straight
up
toward
the
sky
not
one
of
us
said
one
word
except
emily
who
squeaked
and
cried
oh
lionel
we
shall
all
be
killed
and
burned
up
of
course
sir
lionel
did
answer
i
would
have
given
anything
to
be
in
senter
place
sitting
beside
him
so
that
i
could
see
his
face
and
guess
what
he
meant
to
do
but
it
was
decided
and
done
in
a
few
seconds
he
took
apollo
on
a
little
farther
and
then
stopped
as
near
the
burning
motor
as
he
dared
so
that
there
might
be
no
danger
of
our
catching
fire
before
we
could
have
counted
one
two
he
had
sprung
from
the
car
and
was
running
toward
the
fiery
chariot
with
young
nick
flying
after
him
dick
burden
got
down
too
and
sauntered
in
their
wake
but
he
did
go
very
fast
it
was
so
exciting
and
confusing
that
i
scarcely
understood
at
first
what
was
happening
but
sir
lionel
tore
off
his
coat
as
he
ran
and
flung
it
round
the
woman
from
the
other
car
she
had
not
been
on
fire
when
she
jumped
out
but
the
grass
and
bushes
close
by
the
road
had
already
begun
to
blaze
and
her
dress
had
caught
in
the
flame
she
was
tall
and
big
but
sir
lionel
lifted
her
up
as
if
she
been
a
child
and
wrapped
in
his
coat
laid
her
down
at
a
little
distance
on
the
grass
where
he
rolled
her
over
and
put
out
the
fire
then
when
she
was
on
her
feet
again
panting
and
sobbing
a
little
he
and
the
other
men
began
stamping
out
the
flames
playing
among
the
low
bushes
lest
they
spread
along
the
moor
as
for
the
car
sir
lionel
said
afterward
it
was
hopeless
trying
to
save
her
as
there
were
gallons
and
gallons
of
petrol
to
burn
it
was
her
brakes
that
had
got
on
fire
and
ignited
the
rest
and
no
sand
or
anything
of
that
sort
to
throw
on
but
while
we
were
staring
at
the
strange
scene
the
flames
died
down
having
drunk
up
all
the
petrol
and
whether
some
part
of
the
mechanism
which
held
the
brakes
in
place
gave
way
suddenly
i
do
know
all
i
do
know
is
that
the
car
quivered
moved
forward
began
running
down
the
tremendous
hill
faster
and
faster
until
with
a
wild
bound
she
disappeared
from
our
sight
over
a
precipice
by
this
time
we
were
all
out
except
emily
hurrying
down
the
hill
to
talk
to
the
people
who
had
lost
their
car
but
would
you
believe
it
they
hardly
cared
for
their
loss
now
they
were
out
of
danger
it
was
a
bride
and
groom
with
their
chauffeur
and
they
were
americans
staying
at
the
imperial
in
torquay
the
bridegroom
was
elderly
but
humorous
and
told
us
he
used
to
hate
motors
and
kept
tortoises
for
pets
because
he
liked
everything
that
moved
slowly
all
his
ancestors
having
come
from
philadelphia
but
the
girl
he
loved
would
marry
him
unless
he
promised
to
take
her
to
england
on
an
automobile
trip
now
he
hoped
she
had
had
enough
and
would
let
him
go
back
to
tortoises
again
he
said
he
had
never
enjoyed
anything
so
much
as
seeing
the
skeleton
jump
over
the
precipice
where
it
could
not
hurt
anyone
but
would
just
fall
quietly
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
the
bride
was
great
fun
too
and
as
she
comes
from
louis
it
is
not
likely
she
will
cultivate
tortoises
when
we
took
them
all
three
back
to
torquay
with
us
squashed
in
anyhow
she
talked
about
running
over
to
paris
and
buying
a
balloon
or
an
aeroplane
we
came
by
way
of
the
buckland
chase
as
it
is
called
private
property
and
an
elfin
glen
of
beauty
for
mile
after
mile
with
the
dart
singing
below
and
the
lover
leap
so
close
that
it
seemed
painfully
realistic
especially
after
the
adventure
of
the
car
which
leaped
into
space
sir
lionel
got
his
coat
burnt
and
his
hands
a
little
too
but
he
would
drive
though
young
nick
might
have
done
so
as
well
as
not
after
all
we
sha
get
to
cornwall
sir
lionel
says
it
would
be
a
crime
to
leave
this
part
of
the
world
without
going
up
the
dart
the
rhine
of
england
in
a
boat
and
seeing
the
beautiful
old
butter
market
at
dartmouth
i
shall
send
you
postcards
from
there
if
i
have
the
chance
for
very
historic
it
will
be
cornwall
the
day
after
but
i
shall
have
to
wire
my
next
address
with
all
the
love
of
your
moorland
princess
you
ought
to
have
seen
emily
and
senter
fussing
over
sir
lionel
when
he
burnt
his
hands
he
hates
being
fussed
over
and
was
almost
cross
until
our
eyes
happened
to
meet
and
then
we
both
smiled
that
seemed
to
make
him
again
and
he
is
wonderfully
patient
with
his
sister
really
xvii
senter
to
her
sister
mrs
burden
at
glen
lachlan
b
hart
hotel
launceston
my
dear
sis
it
came
off
all
right
my
things
usually
do
they
with
some
women
it
is
only
their
and
face
powder
that
come
off
with
me
it
is
plans
luckily
i
inherited
mamma
genius
for
high
diplomacy
while
you
alas
only
came
in
for
her
rheumatism
and
by
the
way
how
your
poor
dear
bones
not
devilled
i
hope
do
forgive
the
cheap
wit
i
am
obliged
to
save
my
best
things
for
sir
lionel
he
appreciates
them
highly
which
is
one
comfort
but
it
is
rather
a
strain
living
up
to
him
though
i
do
think
it
will
pay
in
the
end
and
in
intercourse
with
my
family
i
must
be
allowed
to
rest
my
brain
when
everything
is
settled
one
way
or
the
other
my
features
also
shall
have
repose
to
keep
young
every
woman
ought
to
go
into
retirement
for
at
least
one
month
out
of
the
twelve
a
fortnight
at
a
time
perhaps
and
do
nothing
but
eat
and
sleep
see
nobody
talk
to
nobody
think
of
nothing
and
especially
not
if
one
followed
that
regime
religiously
with
or
without
prayer
and
fasting
one
need
never
have
of
course
with
you
it
is
different
you
have
now
decided
to
live
for
dick
and
let
your
waist
measure
look
after
itself
but
i
have
larger
aims
and
fewer
years
than
you
dearest
my
conception
of
widowhood
is
to
be
as
young
as
possible
as
attractive
as
possible
as
rich
as
possible
and
eventually
to
read
my
title
clear
to
at
least
a
baronet
and
have
a
castle
in
a
good
hunting
county
there
are
difficulties
in
my
upward
way
yet
i
feel
strongly
i
shall
overcome
them
let
my
motto
be
the
battle
to
the
smart
and
the
situation
to
the
pretty
why
should
i
triumph
on
both
counts
the
ward
to
be
sure
is
pretty
and
is
in
the
situation
but
she
does
know
her
own
advantages
and
i
not
sure
she
would
marry
sir
lionel
if
he
asked
her
which
at
present
he
apparently
has
no
intention
of
doing
although
he
admires
her
more
warmly
than
either
dick
or
i
think
advisable
in
a
guardian
since
i
wrote
you
last
just
before
starting
on
this
motor
venture
of
ours
there
have
been
several
new
developments
i
do
know
whether
you
are
any
deeper
in
dick
confidence
in
this
affair
than
i
am
though
i
fancy
not
but
i
scent
a
mystery
dick
really
detective
talent
dear
sis
and
if
i
were
you
i
should
oppose
his
setting
up
as
a
sort
of
sherlock
holmes
whether
he
has
found
out
about
some
schoolgirl
peccadillo
of
miss
lethbridge
and
is
dangling
it
over
her
head
damocles
sword
fashion
i
ca
tell
because
wo
tell
though
he
looks
offensively
wise
when
i
tease
him
and
i
have
tried
in
vain
on
my
own
account
to
discover
but
certain
it
is
that
he
is
either
blackmailing
her
in
a
way
or
hypnotizing
her
to
obey
his
orders
he
hinted
you
know
that
he
could
get
the
girl
to
make
sir
lionel
invite
us
to
join
the
motoring
party
but
i
supposed
then
that
she
had
a
weakness
of
the
heart
where
my
dear
nephew
was
concerned
now
my
opinion
is
that
she
dislikes
yet
fears
him
not
very
complimentary
to
dick
but
he
does
seem
to
mind
and
is
enjoying
himself
immensely
in
his
own
deliciously
impertinently
perky
way
somehow
or
other
he
has
induced
her
to
be
more
or
less
engaged
to
him
a
temporary
arrangement
i
understand
but
pleasing
to
him
and
convenient
to
me
what
dick
gets
out
of
it
i
do
know
and
do
enquire
but
get
out
of
it
the
satisfaction
of
shelving
the
girl
as
a
possible
rival
sir
lionel
who
it
useless
to
spare
your
motherly
vanity
has
no
very
warm
appreciation
of
dick
qualities
is
disgusted
with
his
ward
for
encouraging
advances
and
is
inclined
to
turn
to
me
for
sympathy
in
that
branch
i
am
a
great
success
and
altogether
am
getting
on
like
a
house
afire
what
if
i
do
have
to
pump
up
an
intelligent
interest
in
politics
in
general
and
affairs
in
the
far
east
in
particular
i
am
fortunately
so
constituted
that
fifteen
minutes
study
of
the
washed
down
by
early
tea
taken
strong
enables
me
to
discourse
brilliantly
on
the
deepest
subjects
during
the
day
and
thank
goodness
virtue
is
rewarded
in
the
evening
with
a
little
bridge
if
i
am
ever
lady
pendragon
sounds
well
does
it
it
shall
be
all
bridge
and
skittles
for
me
and
devil
take
politics
military
science
history
the
classics
herbert
spencer
robert
browning
shakespeare
and
all
other
boring
or
things
and
writers
if
he
already
taken
them
on
which
i
am
now
obliged
to
keep
up
a
sort
of
of
conversation
as
to
dick
affairs
however
if
the
girl
really
is
the
heiress
we
thought
her
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
use
my
influence
in
every
direction
at
once
to
make
the
temporary
arrangement
a
permanent
one
but
the
worst
of
it
is
i
not
at
all
sure
that
she
is
any
sort
of
an
heiress
sir
lionel
intimated
to
me
the
other
night
when
i
was
tactfully
tickling
him
with
hints
that
she
has
little
except
what
he
may
choose
to
give
her
if
that
be
true
i
fear
as
dick
her
will
not
be
large
but
it
strikes
me
as
very
probable
that
he
was
only
trying
to
put
me
off
or
rather
to
put
dick
off
if
dick
were
i
do
know
whether
to
believe
his
version
or
not
therefore
but
i
did
get
at
one
fact
which
may
help
us
to
find
out
for
ourselves
dear
ellaline
is
a
daughter
of
lethbridge
it
was
rather
a
shock
to
hear
this
for
i
have
a
vague
impression
that
there
was
once
a
scandal
quite
a
ripe
juicy
scandal
about
a
frederic
lethbridge
can
it
have
been
this
frederic
lethbridge
and
if
so
had
it
anything
to
do
with
money
matters
i
have
mentioned
my
doubts
to
dick
because
he
really
is
idiotically
in
love
with
the
girl
and
is
capable
of
foolishness
i
intend
to
let
him
go
on
as
he
is
going
for
the
present
as
he
can
do
himself
no
harm
and
can
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
by
keeping
his
darling
out
of
my
way
and
sir
lionel
thoughts
but
of
course
he
must
be
allowed
to
marry
her
if
she
has
nothing
of
her
own
sir
lionel
is
rich
but
not
rich
enough
to
make
his
ward
rich
enough
for
dick
and
keep
plenty
for
his
wife
when
he
gets
one
if
she
be
anything
like
your
dear
hostess
who
would
by
this
time
be
my
hostess
if
i
otherwise
engaged
knows
everything
and
everybody
not
only
that
she
has
done
both
for
a
considerable
term
of
years
you
remember
the
joke
about
her
being
torn
between
the
desire
not
to
exceed
the
age
of
and
yet
to
boast
a
friendship
with
lord
beaconsfield
well
she
can
have
known
frederic
lethbridge
and
all
about
him
without
being
a
day
over
forty
as
that
is
sir
lionel
age
and
lethbridge
was
a
distant
relative
of
his
tell
lady
macrae
that
say
that
the
frederic
lethbridge
you
are
inquiring
about
married
a
miss
de
nesville
and
that
there
is
a
daughter
in
existence
a
girl
of
nineteen
if
lady
mac
does
know
anything
get
her
to
ask
her
friends
but
do
hurry
up
for
dick
sake
there
a
dear
otherwise
i
sha
be
able
to
pull
the
strings
as
you
would
like
me
to
and
already
my
sweet
nerves
are
jangled
out
of
tune
dear
lady
mac
is
so
adorably
frank
when
she
has
something
disagreeable
to
say
that
you
have
no
difficulty
in
ferreting
out
the
truth
if
it
anything
nasty
for
most
reasons
i
hope
it
is
as
a
rich
girl
would
be
a
valuable
bird
in
the
hand
for
dick
and
i
am
on
the
spot
to
see
his
affairs
as
well
as
my
own
through
whatever
happens
for
my
part
if
sir
lionel
were
up
to
such
a
fatiguingly
high
level
of
intelligence
i
believe
i
could
fall
in
love
with
him
he
may
be
descended
from
king
arthur
but
he
looks
more
like
lancelot
and
i
fancy
might
make
love
rather
nicely
once
he
let
himself
go
although
long
since
he
did
any
soldiering
he
shows
that
he
a
soldier
born
not
made
he
has
improved
if
anything
since
we
knew
him
in
india
but
i
remember
you
used
to
be
quite
afraid
of
having
to
talk
to
him
then
and
preferred
colonel
whom
you
thought
jolly
and
though
somehow
i
never
got
on
with
him
very
well
i
always
had
the
feeling
he
was
trying
to
read
me
and
i
do
dislike
that
sort
of
thing
in
a
man
it
ruins
human
intercourse
and
takes
away
all
natural
desire
to
flirt
you
ask
me
how
i
endure
emily
norton
well
as
i
sit
beside
sir
lionel
in
the
car
i
do
need
to
bother
with
her
much
in
the
daytime
she
hates
bridge
and
thinks
playing
for
money
wrong
in
most
circumstances
but
considers
it
her
duty
to
please
her
brother
guests
and
as
she
never
wins
anyhow
it
need
affect
her
conscience
i
tell
her
that
always
give
my
winnings
to
charity
and
did
think
it
necessary
to
add
that
to
my
idea
charity
should
not
only
begin
at
home
but
end
there
unless
its
resources
were
unlimited
the
poor
dull
thing
has
that
kind
of
religion
that
sends
her
soul
trotting
every
other
minute
to
look
in
the
glass
and
see
that
it
has
smudged
itself
so
trying
once
she
asked
me
what
i
did
for
soul
i
longed
to
tell
her
i
took
oil
or
somebody
fruit
salt
but
dare
on
account
of
sir
lionel
and
she
has
such
a
conceited
way
of
saying
when
speaking
of
the
future
if
the
lord
spares
me
till
next
year
i
will
do
so
and
so
as
if
he
were
in
immediate
need
of
her
but
might
be
induced
to
get
on
without
her
for
a
short
time
one
would
know
by
the
way
she
screws
up
her
hair
that
she
could
never
have
felt
a
temptation
but
i
shall
not
let
myself
be
troubled
much
with
her
if
i
marry
sir
lionel
she
can
go
back
to
her
doctor
and
her
curates
and
be
invited
for
christmas
to
graylees
which
by
the
way
i
hope
to
inspect
when
we
have
finished
this
tour
i
am
looking
quite
lovely
in
my
motoring
things
and
enjoying
myself
very
much
on
the
whole
devonshire
i
found
too
hot
for
this
time
of
the
year
but
the
scenery
is
pretty
i
had
no
idea
what
a
jolly
little
river
the
dart
is
and
dartmouth
is
rather
quaint
for
those
who
are
keen
on
old
things
i
suppose
the
butter
market
would
be
interesting
but
i
ca
really
see
why
because
things
happened
in
certain
places
hundreds
of
years
ago
one
should
stand
and
stare
at
walls
or
windows
or
fireplaces
the
things
have
happened
somewhere
although
charles
the
second
for
instance
may
have
been
great
fun
to
know
and
one
would
have
enjoyed
flirting
with
him
now
that
he
been
dead
and
out
of
reach
for
ages
he
of
no
importance
to
me
we
left
torquay
yesterday
and
arrived
here
in
the
evening
after
a
hilly
but
nice
run
and
lunching
at
plymouth
of
course
a
lot
of
nonsense
was
talked
about
sir
francis
drake
one
almost
forgets
the
old
boy
did
except
to
play
bowls
or
something
but
i
have
a
way
of
seeming
to
know
things
for
which
i
deserve
more
credit
than
anyone
save
you
would
guess
when
they
were
not
jabbering
about
him
at
lunch
it
was
about
the
which
apparently
sailed
from
plymouth
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
americans
with
ancestors
i
never
met
any
americans
yet
except
the
kind
who
boast
of
having
begun
as
shoeblacks
whose
did
cross
in
the
it
must
have
been
a
huge
ship
or
else
a
lot
of
the
ancestors
went
in
the
steerage
or
were
stewards
or
stowaways
there
was
a
ferry
getting
from
devonshire
into
cornwall
so
of
course
we
just
missed
a
boat
and
had
to
wait
half
an
hour
i
was
dying
to
go
to
sleep
but
the
others
were
as
chirpy
as
possible
gabbling
cornish
legends
when
i
say
the
others
i
mean
sir
lionel
and
ellaline
lethbridge
i
did
know
any
legends
but
i
made
up
several
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
much
more
exciting
than
theirs
and
that
pleased
sir
lionel
as
he
is
a
cornishman
heavens
how
i
did
take
it
out
of
myself
admiring
his
native
land
when
we
got
across
that
ferry
said
the
scenery
was
quite
different
from
that
of
devonshire
at
the
first
go
off
and
i
not
sure
there
differences
the
road
coming
toward
launceston
really
was
romantic
part
of
the
way
with
a
lot
of
pink
and
yellow
lichen
and
again
fine
open
spaces
with
distant
blue
downs
against
a
sky
which
looked
as
i
remarked
to
sir
lionel
as
if
the
gods
had
poured
a
libation
of
golden
wine
over
it
not
bad
that
was
it
i
believe
we
passed
an
arthurian
which
naturally
interested
him
immensely
therefore
to
interest
poor
me
he
seems
to
think
there
actually
an
arthur
and
was
quite
pleased
with
me
for
saying
that
all
the
cornish
names
of
places
rang
with
romance
like
fairy
bells
sounding
from
under
the
sea
perhaps
from
atlantis
anyhow
they
a
relief
after
such
devonshire
horrors
as
meavy
and
hoo
meavy
which
are
like
the
lisping
of
babies
sir
lionel
thought
the
derivations
of
such
names
an
absorbing
subject
but
living
in
the
east
so
long
has
made
him
quixotically
patriotic
here
and
there
we
passed
a
whole
villageful
of
cottages
with
moss
covering
their
roofs
rather
picturesque
and
some
of
the
stone
houses
are
nice
in
their
way
too
i
suppose
distinctively
cornish
not
that
i
care
i
glad
graylees
castle
is
in
cornwall
which
is
too
far
from
town
there
were
some
about
to
mar
the
scenery
toward
the
end
of
the
journey
and
the
road
surface
was
bad
compared
to
what
we
had
if
the
car
were
a
very
good
one
we
should
have
suffered
from
the
bumps
ellaline
lethbridge
by
the
way
said
something
about
cornwall
which
puzzled
me
suddenly
she
exclaimed
why
the
atmosphere
here
is
like
spain
everything
swims
in
a
sea
of
coloured
lights
thought
spent
all
her
life
at
school
in
france
and
i
mentioned
the
impression
upon
which
she
replied
with
an
air
of
being
taken
aback
i
mean
from
what
i
have
of
spain
can
she
have
had
an
escapade
i
wonder
but
that
is
dick
business
not
mine
at
present
there
a
castle
in
launceston
which
has
kept
us
over
as
sir
lionel
has
been
in
these
parts
before
and
ca
rest
unless
we
see
everything
he
admired
in
his
youth
i
wish
he
had
seen
so
much
there
be
less
for
us
to
do
i
pottering
about
seeing
sights
in
the
rain
and
it
has
been
trying
to
rain
all
day
it
well
enough
to
say
that
the
rain
rains
alike
on
the
just
and
the
unjust
but
that
is
not
true
as
some
women
hair
curls
naturally
ellaline
does
and
mine
does
except
the
part
i
owe
for
at
truefitt
it
an
old
hotel
that
we
in
quite
pleased
to
show
its
age
and
i
have
made
rather
a
beast
of
myself
with
some
sort
of
cornish
pasty
which
it
seems
is
a
local
favourite
and
spoils
the
peasants
teeth
cornish
cream
is
good
and
i
understand
from
sir
lionel
was
invented
by
the
phoenicians
i
suppose
they
drowned
their
sorrows
in
it
while
working
in
the
tin
mines
one
always
associates
with
them
we
go
to
tintagel
and
do
some
other
cornish
things
i
know
what
but
write
to
me
at
bideford
as
we
shall
be
back
in
devonshire
in
a
few
days
on
our
way
i
fancy
toward
wales
i
long
to
hear
what
you
or
lady
mac
may
have
up
your
sleeves
about
the
dear
ellaline
papa
ever
your
affectionate
gwen
dick
sends
his
love
and
will
write
xviii
senter
to
her
sister
mrs
burden
arthur
castle
my
dear
sis
i
sorry
i
told
you
to
write
to
bideford
as
we
stopping
at
this
place
several
days
and
i
might
have
had
your
answer
here
however
it
too
late
now
as
by
this
time
your
letter
is
in
the
post
perhaps
and
we
may
or
may
not
leave
i
think
i
can
be
pretty
sure
your
wire
to
dick
means
that
you
heard
from
me
and
that
the
news
for
him
is
not
favourable
if
he
guessed
that
i
been
questioning
you
about
the
eligibility
of
his
girl
frankly
i
doubt
if
he
have
swallowed
the
bait
of
your
telegram
even
as
it
was
he
seemed
restive
and
did
yearn
to
be
packed
off
to
scotland
even
for
a
few
days
however
he
committed
himself
by
reading
your
message
aloud
before
he
stopped
to
think
and
when
sir
lionel
and
ellaline
had
learned
that
you
were
ill
and
wanted
him
they
would
have
been
shocked
if
refused
to
go
i
comforted
him
by
promising
to
sow
strife
between
ward
and
guardian
as
often
and
diligently
as
possible
until
he
can
get
back
to
look
after
his
own
interests
and
i
shall
do
my
best
to
keep
the
promise
not
for
dick
sake
alone
he
was
off
within
an
hour
after
the
telegram
a
little
sulky
but
not
too
worried
as
he
has
the
faith
engendered
by
experience
in
your
recuperative
powers
i
naturally
worry
still
less
as
i
have
a
clue
to
the
mystery
of
your
attack
which
dick
does
possess
i
quite
believe
that
by
the
time
he
reaches
your
side
it
will
no
longer
be
a
bedside
but
a
sofaside
that
you
be
able
to
smile
hold
dick
hand
and
replace
benger
food
with
slices
of
partridge
and
sips
of
champagne
by
the
way
this
is
the
glorious
twelfth
it
does
seem
odd
and
frumpish
not
to
be
in
scotland
but
motoring
covers
a
multitude
of
social
sins
not
a
word
has
been
said
about
birds
our
sporting
talk
is
of
mufflers
pinions
brakes
and
chainless
drives
the
tyndals
have
turned
up
at
this
hotel
more
gorgeous
and
more
bored
than
ever
but
they
have
taken
a
fancy
to
ellaline
lethbridge
and
i
am
playing
it
for
all
it
worth
it
comes
in
handy
at
the
moment
and
i
have
no
conscientious
scruples
against
using
millionaires
for
pawns
they
have
an
impossibly
luxurious
motorcar
sir
lionel
thinks
it
vulgar
but
they
are
pleased
with
it
as
it
still
a
new
toy
i
have
been
making
a
nice
little
plan
for
them
which
concerns
ellaline
none
of
them
know
it
yet
but
they
will
soon
and
if
it
had
been
invented
to
please
dick
which
it
was
entirely
it
could
suit
him
better
you
may
tell
him
that
if
by
any
chance
he
with
you
still
when
you
get
this
my
mind
is
busy
working
the
plan
out
so
that
there
may
be
no
hitch
but
a
few
unoccupied
corners
of
my
brain
are
wondering
what
you
have
discovered
about
miss
lethbridge
prospects
and
antecedents
how
if
both
are
very
undesirable
you
intend
to
persuade
dick
to
let
her
drop
if
i
were
you
i
would
waste
arguments
retain
him
a
few
days
if
you
can
though
i
fear
the
only
way
to
do
so
is
to
have
a
fit
i
believe
that
can
be
arranged
by
eating
soap
and
frothing
at
the
mouth
which
produces
a
striking
effect
and
though
slightly
disagreeable
dangerous
but
seriously
if
he
refuses
to
hear
reason
do
worry
i
am
on
the
spot
to
snatch
him
at
the
last
moment
from
the
mouth
of
the
lionness
provided
she
opens
it
wide
enough
to
swallow
him
your
ever
useful
and
affectionate
sister
gwen
the
tyndals
have
got
a
cousin
of
george
with
them
a
budding
millionaire
from
eton
who
has
fallen
in
love
at
sight
with
the
lethbridge
but
even
dick
ca
be
jealous
of
childhood
and
it
may
be
helpful
taking
everything
together
i
am
enjoying
myself
here
though
impatient
to
get
your
letter
cornwall
agrees
with
sir
disposition
and
he
is
being
delightful
to
everyone
i
think
while
he
is
in
the
right
mood
i
shall
repeat
to
him
what
a
sad
failure
my
marriage
was
and
how
little
i
really
care
for
gaiety
society
my
lover
solitude
my
husband
sort
of
thing
he
is
the
kind
of
man
to
like
that
and
the
sweet
soft
air
of
cornwall
is
conducive
to
credulity
xix
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
arthur
castle
most
dear
and
sovran
lady
i
call
you
that
because
i
just
been
reading
sir
thomas
malory
le
morte
is
that
old
french
spelling
and
because
the
style
of
address
seems
suitable
to
king
arthur
castle
which
is
really
his
castle
you
know
but
an
hotel
i
thought
it
was
the
castle
though
when
i
first
saw
it
standing
up
gray
and
massive
on
an
imposing
hill
i
supposed
it
had
been
restored
and
was
rather
disappointed
to
find
it
an
hotel
though
it
very
jolly
to
live
in
with
all
the
latest
feudal
improvements
and
fittings
and
king
arthur
round
table
in
the
enormous
sir
lionel
would
let
senter
laugh
at
me
for
thinking
it
the
real
castle
but
said
it
was
a
natural
mistake
for
a
girl
who
had
spent
all
her
life
in
a
french
school
and
how
should
i
know
the
difference
i
grateful
to
him
for
though
i
love
to
have
some
people
laugh
at
me
she
is
one
of
those
people
she
laughs
in
that
sniffy
way
cats
have
the
real
castle
i
can
see
from
my
own
feudal
castellated
balcony
it
is
beautifully
ruined
but
you
can
go
into
it
and
i
have
been
only
i
want
to
tell
you
about
other
things
first
in
my
short
note
from
launceston
did
i
mention
the
old
norman
house
which
belongs
to
cousins
of
sir
lionel
he
used
to
visit
there
and
poke
about
in
the
castle
which
was
godwin
and
harold
before
the
conquest
but
the
nicest
cousins
are
dead
and
the
rest
are
away
so
we
could
only
see
the
outside
of
the
house
however
we
went
to
call
at
an
ancient
stone
cottage
of
the
colour
of
petrified
wallflowers
to
see
a
servant
who
took
care
of
sir
lionel
when
he
was
a
child
a
wonderful
old
wisp
of
a
thing
with
the
reputation
of
being
a
witch
which
wins
her
great
respect
and
she
used
quaint
cornish
words
that
have
come
down
from
generation
to
generation
ever
since
the
early
celts
without
changing
when
sir
lionel
sympathized
with
her
about
her
death
she
said
it
was
a
grief
but
he
been
a
sad
invalid
and
a
good
bit
in
the
way
of
the
oven
for
several
years
illustration
sir
lionel
county
on
the
way
to
tintagel
from
launceston
we
passed
slaughter
bridge
one
of
the
many
places
where
legend
says
king
arthur
fought
his
last
battle
so
that
was
a
good
entrance
to
arthurian
country
was
it
our
road
cut
huge
rolling
downs
in
two
and
they
surged
up
on
either
side
so
it
was
rather
like
the
passage
through
the
red
sea
and
under
a
sky
that
hung
over
us
like
an
illimitable
bluebell
we
saw
our
first
cornish
mountains
rough
tor
and
brown
willy
names
of
that
sort
make
you
feel
at
home
with
mountains
at
once
as
if
you
known
them
all
your
life
and
might
lead
them
about
with
a
string
but
they
are
only
corruptions
of
old
celtic
names
that
nobody
could
possibly
pronounce
and
nearly
everything
seems
more
or
less
celtic
in
cornwall
especially
eyes
they
are
beautiful
with
their
black
lashes
as
long
on
the
lower
as
on
the
upper
lid
and
look
as
if
they
had
been
rubbed
in
with
a
dirty
finger
now
i
see
that
sir
lionel
eyes
are
celtic
i
did
know
quite
how
to
account
for
them
at
first
has
a
temper
i
think
and
could
be
severe
but
he
says
the
cornish
people
are
so
that
if
you
ask
them
the
way
anywhere
they
tell
you
the
one
they
think
you
would
prefer
to
take
whether
it
really
right
or
not
but
i
glad
he
is
not
so
easy
going
as
that
it
was
exciting
to
wheel
into
a
little
road
like
a
lane
marked
tintagel
i
felt
my
copy
of
le
morte
turning
in
my
hand
like
a
rod
we
took
the
lane
to
avoid
a
tremendous
hill
because
hills
give
norton
the
creeps
in
her
feet
and
back
hair
and
she
never
recovers
until
she
has
had
tea
but
it
was
a
charming
lane
with
views
by
and
by
of
wide
purple
moorland
with
new
heather
and
the
sky
had
turned
from
bluebell
azure
to
green
and
rose
in
a
wonderful
chameleon
way
which
it
seems
that
the
sky
has
in
cornwall
i
suppose
it
was
a
celtic
habit
all
about
us
billowed
a
profusion
of
wild
beauty
and
though
for
a
long
time
there
was
nothing
alive
in
sight
except
a
flock
of
bright
pink
sheep
my
fancy
called
up
knights
of
the
round
table
pricking
the
downs
on
their
panoplied
steeds
to
the
rescue
of
fair
distressed
damsels
and
the
bright
mirrors
which
the
fleeting
rain
had
dropped
along
the
road
were
the
knights
polished
shields
laid
down
to
save
the
ladies
from
wetting
the
points
of
their
jewelled
slippers
then
came
my
first
sight
of
the
cornish
sea
deep
hyacinth
with
golden
sails
scattered
upon
it
and
arthur
cliffs
rising
dark
out
of
its
satin
sheen
beyond
in
the
background
gray
houses
and
cottages
grouped
together
the
stone
and
slates
worn
shiny
with
age
like
very
old
marble
so
that
they
reflected
glints
of
colour
from
the
rose
and
violet
sky
by
the
time
i
was
dressed
for
dinner
it
was
sunset
and
i
went
to
sit
on
the
terrace
and
watch
the
splendid
cloud
pageant
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
had
come
down
yet
though
to
tell
the
whole
truth
i
had
had
a
sneaking
idea
sir
lionel
would
perhaps
be
strolling
about
with
a
cigarette
looking
nice
and
slim
and
young
and
soldierly
in
his
dinner
jacket
he
is
nicer
to
look
at
in
that
than
in
almost
anything
else
i
think
as
most
englishmen
are
he
was
there
however
so
i
had
to
admire
his
cornish
sunset
without
him
and
i
had
such
fine
thoughts
about
it
too
at
least
they
seemed
fine
to
me
and
if
i
were
quite
a
congenial
friend
of
my
own
it
would
have
seemed
a
waste
of
good
material
to
lavish
them
on
myself
alone
i
saw
through
the
open
door
of
the
sunset
into
arthur
kingdom
where
he
still
rules
you
know
and
is
lord
of
all
the
whole
west
was
a
and
across
the
blaze
of
golden
glory
rode
dark
shapes
of
cloud
purple
and
crimson
violet
and
black
they
were
arthur
knights
tilting
in
tournament
while
the
queen
of
beauty
and
her
attendant
ladies
looked
on
now
and
then
as
i
watched
a
knight
fell
and
a
horse
tore
away
riderless
his
trappings
floating
on
the
wind
when
this
happened
out
of
the
illumined
sea
would
writhe
a
glittering
dragon
or
scaly
heraldic
beast
to
prance
or
fly
along
the
horizon
after
the
vanishing
charger
of
the
fallen
knight
sometimes
the
rushing
steed
would
swim
to
a
fairy
island
or
that
floated
on
the
shining
water
or
jutted
dark
out
of
a
creamy
line
of
breakers
and
though
i
knew
that
the
knights
and
ladies
and
wondrous
animals
were
but
inhabitants
of
sunset
kingdom
limited
and
that
the
glimmering
islands
and
jagged
rocks
would
dissolve
by
and
by
into
they
all
looked
as
real
as
the
long
tongue
of
land
beyond
which
north
devon
crouched
hiding
and
the
colour
flamed
so
fiercely
in
the
sky
that
i
was
half
afraid
the
sun
must
be
on
fire
as
i
sat
there
watching
the
last
of
the
knights
ride
away
three
people
came
out
of
the
hotel
and
stood
on
the
terrace
i
just
gave
them
one
glance
and
went
back
to
the
sunset
but
somehow
i
got
the
feeling
that
they
were
looking
at
me
and
talking
about
me
presently
they
began
to
walk
up
and
down
and
as
they
passed
in
front
of
my
seat
they
turned
an
interested
gaze
upon
me
all
i
had
known
about
them
until
then
was
that
they
were
a
trio
a
man
a
woman
and
a
boy
with
conventional
backs
but
as
they
turned
i
recognized
the
man
and
the
woman
you
would
never
guess
who
they
were
so
i
tell
you
do
you
remember
the
people
for
whom
you
talked
italian
at
venice
four
years
and
a
half
ago
the
day
we
arrived
and
there
was
a
strike
and
no
porters
to
carry
anybody
luggage
well
here
they
were
at
tintagel
i
was
perfectly
certain
of
this
in
an
instant
and
i
realized
why
they
were
so
interested
in
me
they
thought
they
had
seen
me
before
but
perhaps
were
not
sure
anyway
they
walked
on
and
only
the
boy
looked
back
he
was
dressed
in
eton
clothes
and
was
exactly
like
all
other
boys
except
that
he
had
mischievous
eyes
and
a
bored
mouth
almost
as
dangerous
a
combination
in
a
boy
i
should
think
as
a
box
of
matches
and
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
i
thought
that
he
was
probably
their
son
and
that
as
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
he
was
wondering
about
me
i
would
have
given
a
lot
to
know
what
they
were
saying
and
whether
venice
was
in
their
minds
or
not
but
i
could
do
nothing
except
hope
they
might
not
place
me
mentally
i
would
get
up
and
go
in
because
that
would
have
been
too
cowardly
and
besides
if
they
were
staying
in
the
hotel
i
should
certainly
run
up
against
them
afterward
i
had
just
decided
to
face
it
out
and
had
put
on
a
forbidding
expression
when
along
came
sir
lionel
so
i
had
to
take
off
the
expression
and
fold
it
away
for
future
emergencies
he
was
smoking
one
of
those
cigarettes
which
go
so
well
with
sunsets
and
he
had
seen
the
king
arthur
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
he
said
he
had
not
supposed
i
should
be
down
so
soon
but
was
hoping
that
i
missed
the
show
wherever
i
was
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
which
is
one
of
his
tricks
if
he
sees
a
woman
never
even
waiting
to
know
if
she
minds
and
asked
if
he
might
sit
on
the
seat
by
me
that
was
too
was
it
the
dick
burdens
of
the
world
plump
themselves
down
by
girls
without
worrying
to
get
permission
they
think
female
things
will
be
too
flattered
for
words
by
a
condescending
male
desire
to
be
near
them
i
told
you
how
nice
sir
lionel
looks
in
evening
clothes
did
i
you
no
idea
what
a
perfect
shape
his
head
is
and
a
large
lake
of
white
shirt
under
a
little
black
silk
bow
is
particularly
becoming
to
a
man
with
a
very
tanned
skin
though
i
do
know
why
one
would
think
it
might
have
the
opposite
effect
and
sir
lionel
does
tie
his
necktie
so
nicely
with
a
kind
of
careless
precision
which
comes
right
of
itself
like
everything
he
does
you
will
think
all
this
is
silly
and
it
is
but
i
keep
noticing
things
about
him
and
liking
them
so
i
tell
you
because
i
may
have
prejudiced
you
against
him
at
first
as
ellaline
prejudiced
me
we
were
beginning
to
have
a
good
talk
about
cornwall
and
quaint
cornish
ways
and
superstitions
when
out
of
the
house
came
senter
the
venice
people
had
just
passed
again
and
were
near
the
hotel
door
as
she
appeared
why
sallie
and
george
she
exclaimed
and
why
gwen
the
venice
lady
answered
they
shook
hands
the
boy
and
all
and
though
sir
lionel
did
pay
much
attention
to
what
was
going
on
i
could
keep
up
our
conversation
suppose
they
tell
senter
they
met
me
in
venice
i
said
to
myself
what
i
do
out
of
one
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
that
they
did
speak
of
me
and
she
threw
a
quick
eager
glance
in
my
direction
a
minute
or
two
later
they
all
strolled
on
together
until
they
had
come
in
front
of
our
seat
there
senter
paused
and
said
sir
lionel
these
are
my
friends
and
tyndal
of
whom
i
think
i
must
have
spoken
to
you
and
this
is
their
cousin
tom
tyndal
they
are
touring
in
their
motor
and
arrived
here
this
afternoon
a
little
before
us
quite
a
coincidence
is
it
and
then
as
if
on
second
thoughts
she
added
me
to
the
introduction
quite
a
coincidence
indeed
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
coincidences
on
any
head
that
is
developing
a
criminal
record
the
tyndals
paid
sir
lionel
compliments
and
seemed
to
be
delighted
to
meet
him
evidently
regarding
him
as
a
great
celebrity
which
i
suppose
he
really
is
then
when
they
had
made
him
sufficiently
uncomfortable
compliments
are
to
him
what
a
sudden
plague
of
locusts
would
be
to
most
men
they
turned
to
me
surely
we
have
met
before
miss
lethbridge
remarked
tyndal
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
senter
features
sharpened
as
she
waited
for
me
to
stammer
or
blush
as
far
as
the
blush
was
concerned
she
had
her
money
worth
and
i
only
did
stammer
because
i
was
obliged
to
stop
and
think
before
replying
i
almost
worshipped
sir
lionel
when
he
answered
for
me
in
a
quick
positive
way
he
has
which
there
seems
no
gainsaying
i
suppose
men
who
live
in
the
east
cultivate
that
as
it
keeps
natives
from
arguing
and
answering
back
impossible
said
he
unless
it
was
at
versailles
where
my
ward
has
been
at
school
since
she
was
a
very
small
child
with
no
holidays
except
at
st
cloud
might
it
have
been
at
paris
obligingly
suggested
senter
determined
i
should
be
let
off
if
conviction
of
any
sort
were
possible
no
i
do
think
it
was
at
paris
murmured
tyndal
reflectively
eyeing
me
in
the
sunset
light
which
was
turning
to
pure
amethyst
now
where
it
have
been
i
seem
to
associate
your
face
with
with
italy
oh
my
goodness
she
getting
warm
in
our
game
of
hide
the
handkerchief
she
has
never
been
to
italy
said
sir
lionel
beginning
to
look
rather
cross
as
if
tyndal
were
taking
liberties
with
his
belongings
of
which
you
see
he
thinks
me
one
not
even
venice
she
persisted
oh
yes
is
it
now
i
know
where
i
seem
to
have
seen
you
at
venice
you
remember
do
you
george
by
this
time
sparks
had
lighted
up
in
sir
lionel
eyes
as
if
he
were
a
turk
and
one
of
the
ladies
of
his
harem
were
unjustly
suspected
it
is
impossible
for
tyndal
to
remember
what
did
happen
he
said
dropping
a
lump
of
ice
into
his
voice
you
saw
someone
who
looked
like
her
in
venice
perhaps
but
not
my
ward
i
was
almost
sorry
for
the
poor
tyndals
who
meant
no
harm
though
they
had
the
air
of
being
so
frightfully
rich
and
prosperous
that
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
pity
them
of
course
it
could
only
have
been
a
resemblance
said
tyndal
with
that
snubby
glare
at
tyndal
which
husbands
and
wives
keep
for
each
other
it
must
have
been
she
responded
taking
up
her
cue
for
naturally
they
did
want
to
begin
their
acquaintance
with
a
distinguished
person
by
offending
him
these
signs
of
docility
caused
sir
lionel
to
relent
and
come
down
off
his
high
horse
whenever
he
has
been
at
all
haughty
or
impatient
with
his
sister
whose
denseness
would
sometimes
try
a
saint
he
is
sorry
in
a
minute
and
tries
to
be
extra
nice
it
was
the
same
now
in
the
case
of
the
poor
tyndals
whose
etonian
cousin
had
all
the
time
been
gazing
up
at
him
with
awed
adoration
as
of
a
hero
on
a
pedestal
and
suddenly
a
quaint
thought
struck
me
i
remembered
about
the
bengalese
sir
lionel
was
supposed
to
have
executed
for
some
offence
or
other
and
i
could
see
him
being
sorry
immediately
afterward
tearing
around
trying
to
stick
their
heads
on
again
and
saying
pleasant
words
well
he
stuck
the
tyndals
heads
on
very
kindly
so
that
they
almost
forgot
they
ever
been
slashed
off
and
when
norton
came
out
which
she
did
in
a
few
minutes
looking
as
if
she
washed
the
dust
off
her
face
with
kitchen
soap
we
all
strolled
up
and
down
together
till
it
was
time
for
dinner
tyndal
walked
with
me
but
not
a
word
did
she
say
about
venice
that
subject
was
to
be
tabooed
but
i
far
from
sure
she
was
convinced
of
her
mistake
and
she
could
overcome
her
intense
interest
in
my
features
however
she
seems
as
if
even
to
please
senter
she
would
care
to
do
me
a
bad
turn
only
i
do
think
people
do
things
from
motives
as
a
rule
do
you
they
just
suddenly
find
they
want
to
do
them
and
presto
the
things
are
done
that
why
the
so
exciting
we
chatted
of
cabbages
and
kings
and
automobiles
and
i
recalled
tracing
like
illusive
lights
and
shadows
before
us
on
the
damp
road
as
we
spun
into
tintagel
no
doubt
they
were
the
pneus
of
the
tyndals
their
table
was
next
ours
in
the
dining
room
so
close
that
was
tossed
back
and
forth
and
it
appeared
that
tyndal
was
as
proud
of
his
car
as
a
cat
of
its
mouse
tyndal
mice
are
her
jewels
and
she
has
droves
of
them
which
she
displayed
at
dinner
afterward
she
did
which
made
her
rings
gleam
beautifully
and
she
said
she
did
particularly
like
doing
it
but
it
was
something
to
kill
time
how
awful
but
i
suppose
frightfully
rich
people
are
like
that
they
sometimes
get
fatty
degeneration
of
the
soul
well
nothing
more
happened
that
evening
except
that
the
tyndal
boy
and
i
made
great
friends
quite
a
nice
boy
pining
for
some
mischief
that
idle
hands
might
do
and
his
cousins
said
that
as
we
were
going
to
stop
several
days
at
tintagel
making
it
a
centre
they
would
stop
too
sir
lionel
did
appear
overjoyed
at
the
decision
but
senter
seemed
glad
she
and
her
sister
mrs
burden
have
known
the
tyndals
for
years
and
are
by
way
of
being
friends
yet
she
works
off
her
little
firework
epigrams
against
them
when
their
backs
are
turned
as
she
does
on
everybody
according
to
her
their
principal
charm
for
society
in
london
is
their
cook
and
she
says
the
art
treasures
in
their
house
are
all
illegitimate
and
so
on
she
makes
sir
lionel
smile
but
i
wonder
if
she
adopt
this
cheap
method
if
ever
mentioned
to
her
as
he
has
to
me
that
of
all
meannesses
he
despises
disloyalty
the
tyndal
boy
went
up
to
bed
before
the
rest
of
us
and
when
sir
lionel
and
norton
had
been
forced
to
play
bridge
with
senter
and
tyndal
i
slipped
away
too
we
lived
in
the
hotel
such
a
short
time
and
it
so
big
that
i
counted
on
recognizing
my
room
by
the
boots
which
i
put
outside
the
door
when
i
went
down
to
sunset
and
dinner
of
course
i
forgotten
my
number
as
i
always
do
i
would
consider
myself
a
normal
girl
if
i
did
there
were
the
boots
not
taken
away
yet
looking
abject
as
boots
do
in
such
situations
but
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
they
compared
favourably
in
size
with
the
gray
and
patent
leather
eccentricities
of
senter
reposing
on
an
adjacent
doormat
with
this
frivolous
reflection
in
my
mind
it
did
occur
to
me
as
i
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
marked
by
my
brown
footgear
that
the
room
now
appeared
farther
to
the
left
along
the
passage
than
i
had
the
impression
of
its
being
i
opened
the
door
which
was
not
locked
walked
in
felt
about
for
the
electric
light
switched
it
on
and
had
sauntered
over
to
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
before
i
noticed
anything
strange
then
to
my
startled
vision
appeared
unfamiliar
brushes
and
combs
on
a
chest
of
drawers
beautiful
but
manly
looking
ones
and
along
the
wall
was
a
row
of
flat
tweed
legs
on
stretchers
for
an
instant
i
stood
still
bewildered
as
if
i
walked
into
a
dream
beguiled
by
a
false
clue
of
boots
and
during
my
few
seconds
of
temporary
aberration
my
dazed
eyes
fell
upon
a
book
which
lay
on
the
table
it
was
sir
lionel
morte
second
volume
he
lent
me
the
first
and
in
it
for
a
marker
was
a
of
i
lost
it
at
torquay
after
we
had
our
dear
good
talk
and
he
knew
i
was
looking
for
it
all
about
the
sitting
room
we
had
at
the
hotel
there
yet
he
never
said
a
word
oh
dear
little
french
mother
you
ca
think
what
an
odd
feeling
it
gave
me
to
see
he
had
kept
my
glove
and
had
put
it
in
his
book
yes
i
believe
you
think
too
because
probably
you
felt
just
like
that
yourself
when
you
were
a
girl
only
you
never
thought
it
to
describe
your
symptoms
for
your
daughter
benefit
i
know
it
was
perfectly
schoolgirlish
of
me
and
i
ought
to
have
outgrown
such
sentimentality
with
my
teens
but
if
you
could
see
sir
lionel
and
understand
the
sort
of
man
he
is
you
would
think
me
so
outrageous
that
he
he
of
all
men
should
care
to
keep
anything
which
would
remind
him
of
an
insignificant
child
like
me
i
afraid
there
came
a
prickly
feeling
in
my
eyelids
and
i
had
the
most
idiotic
desire
to
kiss
the
book
which
i
knew
would
have
a
nice
smell
of
his
cigarettes
because
my
borrowed
volume
has
of
course
i
would
have
done
it
for
anything
though
so
do
think
i
worse
than
i
am
and
really
really
i
believe
i
exactly
in
love
i
hope
i
not
so
foolish
it
just
a
kind
of
infatuated
fascination
of
a
moth
not
for
a
candle
but
for
a
great
brilliant
motor
lamp
i
seen
them
at
night
dashing
themselves
against
the
glass
of
our
bleriots
once
or
twice
when
we
been
out
late
and
i
know
how
hopelessly
they
smash
their
soft
silly
wings
i
should
have
been
like
them
if
i
kissed
the
book
but
instead
after
that
one
look
which
told
me
the
glove
really
was
glove
i
bounced
out
of
the
room
snatching
my
boots
up
as
i
dashed
across
the
threshold
bump
as
i
did
so
i
almost
telescoped
with
sir
lionel
who
had
retrieved
his
boots
probably
from
my
doormat
and
at
the
same
moment
came
a
boyish
yelp
from
somewhere
followed
by
the
smart
slap
of
a
door
shutting
i
wished
it
had
been
a
smart
slap
of
my
hand
on
the
tyndal
boy
ear
for
of
course
the
was
that
little
fiend
work
i
guessed
in
a
second
so
did
sir
lionel
and
we
both
laughed
at
ourselves
at
each
other
and
everything
it
seems
that
the
youthful
horror
had
changed
every
pair
of
boots
along
the
corridor
and
made
the
most
weird
combinations
i
suppose
sir
lionel
thought
about
the
glove
in
the
book
anyway
at
the
time
and
luckily
there
was
nothing
in
my
room
in
case
he
strayed
in
except
your
photograph
in
the
silver
frame
you
gave
me
on
my
last
birthday
and
of
course
he
could
make
nothing
of
that
he
had
got
out
of
playing
bridge
because
when
tyndal
saw
he
keen
she
offered
to
take
a
hand
and
he
said
he
did
want
to
write
to
a
man
in
bengal
his
best
friend
we
talked
to
each
other
only
a
few
minutes
after
the
had
been
put
right
but
would
you
believe
it
up
came
senter
while
sir
lionel
and
i
were
bidding
each
other
good
night
in
front
of
my
door
she
looked
as
stiff
and
wicked
as
a
frozen
snake
for
an
instant
then
she
smiled
too
sweetly
and
said
she
come
for
her
spanish
lace
mantilla
but
i
almost
know
she
had
fancied
that
sir
lionel
might
have
made
an
excuse
to
get
a
word
with
me
and
had
flown
up
to
find
out
for
herself
you
can
imagine
dear
that
i
did
feel
much
like
going
to
bed
when
i
finished
saying
and
shut
my
door
upon
the
world
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
birthplace
of
sir
lionel
ancestor
king
arthur
pendragon
was
too
romantic
and
wonderful
to
go
tamely
to
sleep
in
and
what
was
my
covered
balcony
for
if
not
to
dream
dreams
and
think
thoughts
by
moonlight
so
i
switched
off
the
electricity
in
my
room
and
went
out
to
find
that
the
moon
which
is
big
and
grand
now
had
come
out
too
tearing
apart
a
great
black
cloud
in
order
to
look
down
on
and
see
if
she
had
any
adorers
anyway
she
must
have
seen
me
for
she
turned
the
night
into
silver
dawn
so
clear
and
bright
that
she
could
have
missed
me
if
she
tried
i
did
wish
for
you
to
be
with
me
then
and
i
ashamed
to
confess
i
would
have
minded
sir
lionel
as
a
companion
because
tintagel
seems
so
much
more
his
than
mine
never
did
i
hear
the
sea
talk
poetry
and
legend
as
it
does
round
those
dark
rocks
of
old
dundagel
i
thought
as
i
leaned
out
from
my
balcony
a
lonely
unappreciated
juliet
that
the
sound
was
like
the
chanting
voice
of
an
ancient
bard
telling
stories
of
the
golden
days
to
himself
or
to
all
who
might
care
to
listen
i
fancied
i
could
hear
the
words
they
found
a
naked
child
upon
the
sands
of
dark
dundagel
by
the
cornish
sea
i
could
see
the
ruined
castle
on
its
twin
cliffs
below
the
cliff
and
between
me
and
the
sea
and
the
very
meagreness
of
what
remains
seemed
to
increase
the
interest
and
mystery
by
stimulating
the
imagination
forcing
it
to
create
its
own
pictures
i
reconstructed
the
castle
building
it
of
the
same
stone
they
use
now
at
tintagel
and
have
used
for
the
last
thousand
years
or
so
a
dark
stone
singularly
rich
with
colour
pansy
and
wallflower
colour
with
splashes
of
green
flung
on
to
dead
gray
like
bright
autumn
leaves
stirred
into
a
heap
of
other
leaves
dim
and
dead
and
the
mortar
for
my
masonry
was
the
moonlight
which
flooded
the
sea
and
those
wide
downs
whose
divisions
into
fields
turned
them
into
enormous
maps
i
worked
myself
up
into
such
a
romantic
mood
that
i
almost
cried
in
the
joy
and
pain
of
living
and
expected
to
look
back
upon
myself
with
the
utmost
spurn
when
i
should
come
back
to
real
life
after
a
good
sleep
in
the
morning
but
i
did
perhaps
because
instead
of
encouraging
the
good
sleep
i
lay
and
listened
to
the
wild
song
of
the
cornish
wind
i
waked
early
feeling
exactly
the
same
if
not
more
so
and
could
hardly
wait
to
get
down
into
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
i
splashed
about
in
a
cold
bath
dressed
as
quickly
as
a
girl
can
and
then
i
committed
what
might
seem
an
indiscreet
act
if
the
last
of
the
pendragons
and
i
did
not
stand
toward
each
other
in
the
place
of
guardian
and
ward
nothing
is
but
thinking
makes
it
so
and
sir
lionel
certainly
does
think
we
in
those
positions
therefore
it
was
all
right
for
me
to
knock
at
his
door
and
ask
through
the
keyhole
if
he
would
very
very
much
mind
taking
me
to
the
castle
he
was
dressed
and
opened
the
door
instantly
it
was
the
one
thing
he
would
have
liked
to
propose
said
he
only
he
had
been
afraid
of
disturbing
me
so
early
was
that
kind
of
him
i
remembered
the
glove
and
the
thought
of
it
was
more
delicious
than
a
breakfast
of
cornish
cream
and
honey
although
of
course
lurking
in
the
background
of
my
mind
was
the
horrid
idea
that
he
might
have
accidentally
picked
the
thing
up
to
use
as
a
bookmark
and
another
idea
gloomier
even
though
not
so
horrid
was
that
even
if
he
does
like
me
well
enough
to
keep
things
of
mine
he
must
soon
grow
to
hate
me
when
he
knows
who
i
am
he
suggested
coffee
but
i
would
have
it
because
i
was
afraid
senter
might
appear
and
want
to
go
to
the
castle
too
i
had
visions
of
her
hearing
our
voices
in
the
corridor
and
dashing
out
of
bed
to
fling
on
her
clothes
but
even
if
she
did
overhear
the
whole
conversation
i
do
think
she
the
kind
who
looks
her
best
before
breakfast
if
she
has
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
anyway
we
were
spared
the
apparition
it
was
a
fine
scramble
getting
to
the
ruins
and
when
sir
lionel
had
opened
a
door
with
a
key
you
get
from
a
cottage
close
by
the
sea
it
was
quite
as
if
he
were
my
host
entertaining
me
in
his
ancestral
home
i
told
him
that
it
felt
twice
as
interesting
to
be
there
with
a
true
pendragon
than
with
a
mere
king
or
anybody
like
that
and
he
seemed
pleased
i
i
am
a
pendragon
he
said
rather
thoughtfully
one
must
try
to
be
always
he
looked
at
me
very
very
kindly
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
say
something
more
but
he
did
speak
and
turned
away
his
eyes
to
look
far
over
the
sea
it
was
only
for
a
little
while
though
that
he
was
sitting
there
on
the
rough
grass
which
is
the
floor
of
the
castle
now
he
told
me
things
about
the
place
and
its
history
how
dundagel
meant
the
safe
castle
and
how
the
arthurian
believers
say
it
was
built
by
the
britons
in
earliest
roman
days
how
david
bruce
of
wales
was
entertained
by
the
earl
of
cornwall
on
the
very
spot
where
we
were
sitting
and
how
the
great
hall
once
famous
was
destroyed
as
long
ago
as
when
chaucer
was
a
baby
and
as
he
talked
the
rising
wind
wailed
and
sobbed
like
old
old
witches
crying
over
the
evil
fallen
on
arthur
and
his
castle
such
an
old
wind
it
was
old
enough
to
have
been
blowing
when
arthur
was
a
baby
drowning
the
lullabies
sung
by
his
mother
igerna
that
greatest
beauty
in
britain
we
forgot
breakfast
and
stopped
in
the
ruins
a
long
time
until
suddenly
we
both
realized
that
we
were
desperately
hungry
but
instead
of
going
up
to
our
own
hotel
we
walked
into
the
quaint
village
whose
real
name
is
trevena
though
nobody
calls
it
that
and
had
something
to
eat
at
a
hotel
where
sir
lionel
used
to
stop
occasionally
when
he
was
a
boy
afterward
we
went
to
see
the
village
schoolmaster
whom
he
knew
such
a
nice
man
who
paints
pictures
as
well
as
teaches
the
children
and
i
felt
guilty
at
being
introduced
as
sir
lionel
ward
i
think
my
conscience
is
like
a
bruised
peach
pinched
by
many
fingers
to
see
if
it
ripe
i
have
that
guilty
feeling
so
often
when
we
spoke
of
the
schoolmaster
versatility
he
laughed
and
said
it
was
nothing
to
his
predecessor
who
used
to
cut
the
children
hair
clip
horses
measure
land
act
as
parish
clerk
as
well
as
teacher
pull
teeth
and
beat
such
transgressors
as
had
to
be
punished
in
a
way
less
serious
than
prison
does
that
take
one
back
to
long
ago
but
so
does
everything
in
tintagel
and
all
over
cornwall
sir
lionel
says
they
have
such
nice
words
here
is
jingle
good
it
some
kind
of
a
conveyance
exactly
the
opposite
of
a
i
fancy
from
the
description
and
i
like
the
word
huer
too
it
means
a
man
who
gives
the
hue
and
cry
when
the
pilchards
are
coming
in
and
all
the
fishermen
must
run
to
the
sea
i
should
like
to
know
everything
about
cornwall
from
the
smugglers
and
the
famous
wrestlers
to
the
witches
the
last
of
whom
lives
near
boscastle
still
but
the
little
that
travellers
in
motors
can
learn
about
places
steeped
in
history
is
like
trying
to
know
all
about
a
beautiful
great
tree
by
one
leaf
of
flying
gold
which
falls
into
the
automobile
as
it
sweeps
by
along
the
road
still
the
little
one
does
learn
is
unforgettable
impressed
upon
the
mind
in
a
different
way
from
the
mere
and
i
suppose
few
people
know
everything
about
every
place
even
in
their
own
countries
if
they
did
i
sure
be
prigs
and
no
one
would
want
to
know
when
we
got
back
to
our
hotel
castle
on
the
cliff
the
tyndals
motor
was
at
the
door
a
huge
gorgeous
chariot
and
nothing
would
do
but
we
must
try
the
car
senter
had
promised
to
go
and
was
putting
on
her
hat
the
tyndals
are
difficult
people
to
resist
because
if
you
try
to
make
excuses
they
pin
you
down
in
one
way
or
another
so
that
you
must
either
do
what
they
want
or
hurt
their
feelings
and
though
sir
lionel
is
supposed
to
have
been
so
strict
in
bengal
he
is
quite
in
england
i
think
he
hates
going
about
in
motors
that
are
his
because
he
enjoys
being
the
man
at
the
helm
which
is
perhaps
characteristic
of
him
however
the
tyndals
swept
all
of
us
except
norton
away
to
delabole
to
see
the
slate
quarries
and
to
have
the
adventure
of
sliding
down
a
fearfully
steep
incline
in
a
tiny
if
that
the
right
word
for
it
i
half
expected
charon
to
meet
me
with
his
at
the
bottom
it
would
have
seemed
much
stranger
than
other
things
in
cornwall
all
that
happened
yesterday
we
have
been
to
trebarwith
strand
and
port
isaac
and
have
walked
to
the
loneliest
church
i
ever
saw
with
the
gravestones
in
the
burying
ground
propped
by
buttresses
that
the
wind
may
throw
them
down
it
is
tintagel
church
though
it
a
good
long
way
from
the
village
and
the
vicarage
is
of
the
fourteenth
century
oh
and
i
heard
a
splendid
legend
about
the
ruined
castle
from
the
vicar
who
is
its
warden
it
seems
when
it
was
built
by
the
old
princes
of
west
wales
very
beautiful
as
well
as
strong
with
walls
painted
of
many
colours
it
was
placed
under
a
powerful
spell
by
merlin
that
it
might
become
invisible
twice
in
every
year
how
i
should
like
to
be
at
tintagel
at
the
right
time
and
see
if
the
ruins
would
disappear
from
before
my
eyes
i
believe
they
would
and
the
enchantment
would
take
the
form
of
a
sea
mist
we
are
to
leave
cornwall
for
bideford
i
had
got
as
far
as
that
when
senter
knocked
at
my
door
and
asked
if
she
might
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
so
i
had
to
say
yes
and
smile
full
well
in
counterfeited
glee
but
i
hated
to
be
interrupted
as
there
was
just
time
before
dressing
for
dinner
to
finish
my
letter
to
you
now
it
is
after
dinner
and
before
i
go
to
bed
i
tell
you
what
has
happened
how
conceited
i
was
to
suppose
it
possible
that
sir
lionel
thought
me
an
important
person
i
am
sure
the
glove
episode
must
have
been
a
mere
accident
serves
me
right
senter
came
to
tell
me
that
they
all
been
talking
about
the
way
to
bideford
and
sir
lionel
said
the
road
was
so
hilly
he
wished
we
had
quite
as
many
passengers
in
the
car
then
the
tyndals
asked
if
they
might
take
me
because
they
made
up
their
minds
to
go
to
bideford
too
and
sir
lionel
answered
that
it
would
be
a
splendid
way
out
of
the
difficulty
if
i
were
willing
the
only
trouble
was
he
did
like
to
propose
such
a
thing
for
fear
of
hurting
my
feelings
and
the
conversation
ended
according
to
senter
by
the
tyndals
planning
to
suggest
the
idea
to
me
as
if
it
were
their
own
then
letting
the
matter
rest
on
my
decision
senter
went
on
to
explain
that
sir
lionel
did
know
she
was
repeating
to
me
what
had
passed
but
that
she
thought
i
would
prefer
to
know
i
sure
should
if
i
were
in
your
place
she
purred
sweetly
when
the
tyndals
invite
you
of
course
you
must
do
exactly
as
you
please
but
do
you
think
for
norton
sake
as
she
such
a
coward
it
would
be
best
to
keep
the
car
as
light
as
possible
since
sir
lionel
fears
the
roads
are
really
bad
oh
certainly
said
i
trying
so
hard
not
to
blush
that
i
must
have
been
purple
i
shall
be
delighted
to
go
with
and
tyndal
in
their
lovely
car
and
it
very
nice
of
them
to
ask
me
you
tell
sir
lionel
i
interfered
will
you
she
begged
i
should
be
quite
afraid
of
him
if
he
were
angry
you
need
worry
he
sha
hear
anything
from
me
said
i
and
you
do
think
i
was
right
to
let
you
know
she
implored
of
course
i
assured
her
but
i
was
feeling
hurt
all
the
way
up
to
my
topmost
hair
and
down
to
my
tipmost
toe
not
that
i
mind
going
with
the
tyndals
but
that
sir
lionel
should
pick
out
as
the
bit
of
superfluous
ballast
to
cast
to
the
winds
that
was
what
made
me
feel
cold
and
old
and
alone
in
the
world
i
conscientiously
told
myself
that
i
was
the
youngest
of
the
party
and
the
right
one
to
sacrifice
but
nothing
was
much
comfort
until
the
thought
jumped
into
my
head
that
maybe
senter
had
fibbed
i
went
to
dinner
buoyed
up
by
that
hope
but
it
died
young
for
the
tyndals
invite
me
in
sir
hearing
and
when
i
said
that
i
should
be
charmed
he
smiled
calmly
so
far
from
making
objections
i
thought
he
looked
quite
pleased
poor
me
i
fancied
in
the
castle
ruins
that
he
actually
liked
my
society
but
i
forgot
that
i
invited
him
to
go
with
me
forget
and
the
glove
your
poor
foolish
conceited
humiliated

dear
dick
your
wire
has
just
come
as
we
are
starting
telegraphed
and
will
leave
a
few
words
for
you
in
pencil
lucky
you
have
a
resourceful
relative
and
that
norton
washing
did
come
till
late
this
morning
my
resourcefulness
enables
me
to
change
my
plans
for
your
benefit
or
rather
to
make
them
work
together
for
your
good
in
the
time
most
women
take
to
change
their
minds
while
the
lateness
of
washing
and
her
mild
obstinacy
in
determining
to
wait
for
it
against
her
brother
wishes
provide
us
with
a
few
extra
minutes
now
it
suddenly
appears
that
young
nick
has
enough
petrol
to
get
on
as
far
as
anywhere
that
will
give
us
more
minutes
brown
buddha
as
your
adored
one
calls
him
has
crawled
humbly
but
swiftly
off
to
obtain
a
new
supply
sir
lionel
already
in
a
vile
temper
for
reasons
which
i
may
have
time
to
explain
is
bursting
with
rage
to
which
he
is
too
proud
to
give
a
natural
outlet
he
looks
ready
to
explode
not
with
bombs
but
with
dambs
i
have
never
heard
him
say
a
single
one
during
the
whole
of
our
acquaintance
but
his
eyes
are
sending
out
a
fiery
cataract
of
them
this
minute
a
good
thing
for
me
he
does
know
what
i
know
or
the
fire
would
be
turned
upon
me
and
i
should
wither
like
she
in
her
second
bath
quickly
i
tell
you
what
i
done
and
why
sir
lionel
is
wild
also
how
i
rearranged
everything
and
everybody
at
the
last
minute
in
order
to
satisfy
you
what
a
precious
darling
aunt
you
have
got
to
be
sure
and
what
a
lot
you
do
owe
her
for
motives
of
my
own
i
planned
to
transplant
your
sweet
ellaline
from
our
to
the
of
others
for
the
day
the
others
are
george
and
sallie
tyndal
about
whose
sudden
apropos
appearance
i
wrote
your
mother
only
yesterday
but
of
course
as
you
leaving
you
miss
the
news
in
that
letter
i
thought
your
anxiety
for
your
parent
health
would
hardly
be
poignant
enough
to
keep
you
in
scotland
long
but
i
did
suppose
you
be
able
to
tear
yourself
away
so
soon
i
do
doubt
you
wonder
how
it
can
be
possible
for
me
to
have
too
much
of
dear
society
but
strange
as
that
may
seem
it
can
and
worse
than
that
i
dislike
sir
lionel
getting
too
much
of
it
i
do
think
it
is
good
for
him
and
he
had
enough
of
the
commodity
since
we
been
in
tintagel
to
produce
according
to
my
point
of
view
and
yours
disastrous
effects
i
decided
that
drastic
measures
were
necessary
for
both
our
sakes
and
with
me
to
decide
is
to
act
when
anything
really
important
is
at
stake
first
i
persuaded
the
tyndals
that
it
would
be
kindly
to
invite
miss
lethbridge
to
travel
in
their
motor
to
bideford
whither
they
also
are
bound
i
said
that
sir
lionel
feared
we
would
be
rather
a
crowd
for
his
car
as
the
roads
are
supposed
to
be
bad
this
flattered
them
for
their
motor
which
is
somewhat
more
powerful
than
ours
is
the
one
object
for
which
they
live
at
present
besides
they
were
delighted
at
the
chance
of
getting
the
girl
to
themselves
as
they
think
they
met
her
years
ago
in
italy
where
it
is
alleged
she
has
never
been
some
school
girl
escapade
perhaps
you
had
better
do
a
little
catechising
later
on
meanwhile
the
tyndals
yearn
for
the
opportunity
of
pumping
sir
lionel
has
quite
fiercely
prevented
them
from
doing
so
up
to
date
he
looked
ready
to
challenge
poor
george
to
a
duel
the
other
evening
for
merely
suggesting
that
they
might
have
met
miss
lethbridge
in
venice
to
sir
i
hinted
that
ellaline
was
bored
now
that
you
were
gone
and
that
she
would
enjoy
the
change
of
travelling
for
a
day
with
new
people
that
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
tyndal
boy
and
i
added
that
she
had
asked
me
privately
whether
i
thought
that
sir
lionel
would
object
to
her
accepting
provided
the
tyndals
wanted
her
to
go
to
bideford
naturally
when
the
invitation
came
he
did
object
you
have
laughed
if
you
could
have
seen
her
face
when
he
smiled
with
apparent
benevolent
delight
upon
the
suggestion
the
sight
would
have
repaid
you
for
many
a
snub
my
poor
swain
that
was
where
matters
stood
till
your
telegram
came
a
few
minutes
ago
all
i
hoped
for
was
to
get
rid
of
the
dear
child
for
one
long
happy
day
and
to
estrange
her
a
little
partly
for
your
sake
from
her
solicitous
guardian
but
your
wire
set
another
bee
humming
in
my
i
determined
to
do
you
a
good
turn
if
i
could
so
i
flew
up
before
answering
you
to
have
a
talk
with
the
tyndals
they
were
starting
a
few
minutes
after
us
by
my
advice
and
had
come
downstairs
yet
ellaline
too
was
still
in
her
room
sulking
no
doubt
and
had
said
to
sir
lionel
or
any
of
us
i
know
that
because
my
room
at
this
hotel
has
been
close
to
hers
and
to
his
too
so
whenever
a
word
is
murmured
on
a
doorstep
i
hear
no
word
has
been
murmured
this
morning
and
has
had
her
breakfast
sent
into
her
bedroom
to
the
tyndals
i
said
that
word
had
arrived
from
you
and
that
in
confidence
i
would
tell
them
that
you
and
miss
lethbridge
are
as
good
as
engaged
at
least
that
you
had
a
private
understanding
which
would
be
an
engagement
if
sir
lionel
were
a
dog
in
the
manger
he
did
want
the
girl
himself
i
explained
yet
he
did
want
to
give
her
to
anyone
else
short
of
a
millionaire
you
i
went
on
to
say
had
wired
that
you
would
be
back
this
evening
and
ellaline
was
dying
to
stay
and
see
you
sir
lionel
did
know
you
were
coming
i
confessed
and
would
be
angry
if
he
did
but
if
they
the
tyndals
could
somehow
misunderstand
the
arrangements
made
overnight
and
in
the
confusion
of
their
minds
leave
miss
lethbridge
behind
it
would
be
a
great
favour
to
everyone
concerned
except
sir
lionel
the
tyndals
who
think
a
lot
of
themselves
because
they
have
more
money
than
brains
are
annoyed
with
sir
because
he
snapped
at
them
about
venice
so
they
were
rather
pleased
at
the
idea
of
doing
him
a
bad
turn
and
at
the
same
time
advancing
love
young
dream
when
i
assured
them
it
would
be
easy
to
say
that
they
understood
ellaline
had
changed
her
mind
and
was
going
with
sir
lionel
they
agreed
to
slip
off
without
her
about
half
an
hour
after
the
flight
of
apollo
that
is
the
plan
as
it
stands
up
to
date
sir
lionel
and
norton
wo
know
till
this
evening
at
bideford
that
is
with
the
tyndals
and
then
of
course
i
shall
get
george
and
sallie
out
of
his
bad
graces
as
well
as
i
can
meanwhile
you
will
find
her
at
tintagel
and
can
bring
her
on
by
rail
that
will
be
delightful
for
you
and
as
sir
lionel
is
in
some
of
his
notions
he
may
be
more
inclined
to
consent
to
an
engagement
between
you
after
the
sort
of
journey
you
and
she
will
have
together
so
i
think
all
interests
will
have
been
served
i
am
writing
in
the
big
hall
of
the
hotel
and
sir
lionel
is
walking
up
and
down
glaring
first
out
of
one
window
and
then
out
of
another
at
the
rain
which
is
beginning
to
come
down
in
drops
as
large
as
i
only
wish
half
crowns
or
even
my
shillings
were
as
plentiful
but
perhaps
they
will
be
some
day
before
long
who
knows
i
do
hope
ellaline
wo
take
it
into
her
head
to
appear
at
the
last
minute
before
we
get
off
and
complicate
things
not
that
i
wo
be
equal
to
disposing
of
her
if
she
does
but
no
here
is
young
nick
very
meek
and
soapy
he
has
got
his
petrol
emily
norton
reluctantly
puts
down
a
volume
of
blackwood
which
she
has
found
in
the
hotel
library
we
are
off
and
good
luck
gwen
xxiii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
dearest
lodestar
i
can
feel
you
drawing
me
across
miles
of
land
and
sea
and
if
only
i
could
travel
on
a
telepathic
pass
i
would
start
this
minute
ellaline
or
no
ellaline
toward
her
and
sir
lionel
i
feel
as
mercutio
felt
toward
the
montagus
and
capulets
a
plague
on
both
your
houses
nobody
seems
to
care
what
becomes
of
me
why
should
i
care
what
becomes
of
them
everything
is
too
horrid
and
too
extraordinary
i
got
into
the
wrong
side
of
bed
last
night
and
got
out
again
on
the
wrong
side
this
morning
it
happened
to
be
the
only
side
there
was
as
the
bed
stands
against
the
wall
in
an
alcove
where
it
ca
be
pulled
out
and
nobody
could
expect
me
to
bound
like
a
kangaroo
over
the
foot
could
they
but
there
are
times
in
life
when
every
side
of
everything
is
wrong
and
this
is
one
of
those
times
with
me
has
been
since
dinner
last
night
when
sir
lionel
grinned
with
joy
at
the
prospect
of
shunting
me
upon
the
tyndal
family
for
a
day
when
you
are
friends
with
people
they
smile
when
you
are
out
with
them
they
grin
well
this
morning
i
thought
i
would
hurry
to
get
down
i
felt
if
senter
beamed
at
me
from
under
her
becoming
at
starting
i
should
do
her
a
mischief
and
if
emily
smirked
inoffensively
i
should
throw
murray
in
her
face
as
for
sir
lionel
words
fail
to
express
what
i
believed
myself
capable
of
doing
to
him
i
could
have
stolen
his
car
in
which
he
appeared
to
grudge
me
a
seat
and
have
gone
off
with
it
into
space
to
be
a
motor
pirate
whence
can
i
have
inherited
these
vicious
tendencies
truly
i
never
supposed
i
had
them
before
but
you
know
yourself
until
people
have
practically
accused
you
of
taking
up
too
much
room
in
their
old
automobiles
although
you
perfectly
aware
that
you
are
less
than
eighteen
inches
wide
at
your
broadest
part
in
your
thickest
frock
and
you
thought
they
liked
your
society
and
kept
your
gloves
in
that
mood
i
would
have
condescended
to
see
apollo
off
if
he
been
twice
a
god
armed
with
an
invitation
for
me
from
juno
to
a
on
olympus
no
sooner
however
did
i
hear
his
dear
familiar
purr
as
he
swept
away
from
the
door
of
the
hotel
my
balcony
is
a
corner
one
and
i
could
just
catch
the
when
i
regretted
intensely
that
i
been
looking
indifferent
suddenly
i
suffered
pangs
of
apprehension
lest
my
stopping
in
my
room
had
seemed
like
what
it
really
was
a
fit
of
the
sulks
but
it
was
past
apollo
was
gone
senter
doubtless
sitting
by
sir
lionel
side
as
usual
and
probably
commenting
wittily
on
my
silly
conduct
the
tyndals
told
me
last
night
that
they
meant
to
start
at
ten
so
i
went
downstairs
five
minutes
before
too
late
to
have
to
wait
about
too
early
to
be
called
i
expected
to
find
them
in
the
hall
and
when
they
were
there
i
strolled
out
to
see
if
the
motor
had
come
to
the
door
thinking
they
might
be
watching
the
loading
up
of
their
luggage
as
for
mine
apollo
had
taken
it
as
usual
except
a
pretty
little
fitted
handbag
small
and
wonderfully
convenient
which
sir
lionel
came
across
in
a
shop
and
bought
for
me
i
mean
for
ellaline
at
torquay
but
there
was
a
tyndal
in
sight
and
not
so
much
as
the
smell
of
a
so
i
wandered
inside
and
asked
the
handsome
landlady
whom
i
met
near
king
arthur
round
table
whether
she
had
seen
the
tyndal
automobile
or
its
owners
why
said
she
they
went
off
about
ten
minutes
ago
went
off
where
i
asked
blankly
to
bideford
i
think
they
were
going
she
replied
that
ca
be
for
i
was
to
have
gone
with
them
said
i
indeed
exclaimed
the
landlady
polite
but
puzzled
i
did
know
i
thought
you
had
gone
with
your
own
party
i
was
surprised
to
meet
you
here
just
now
i
afraid
there
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
for
certainly
and
tyndal
and
their
young
cousin
have
really
gone
because
they
bade
me
here
in
the
hall
and
said
they
hoped
to
come
back
some
day
she
looked
at
me
pityingly
and
i
felt
exactly
like
robinson
crusoe
before
he
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
friday
but
like
him
i
kept
a
stiff
upper
lip
i
am
happy
to
say
i
even
laughed
well
that
very
funny
said
i
as
if
being
by
sir
lionel
and
marooned
by
the
tyndals
was
the
most
amusing
experience
in
the
world
and
i
simply
delighted
in
it
of
course
somebody
or
other
will
count
noses
and
miss
me
after
a
while
then
they
have
to
come
back
and
fetch
me
i
suppose
you
could
go
on
to
bideford
by
rail
if
you
liked
the
landlady
informed
me
gratuitously
there
is
a
train
early
this
afternoon
and
oh
i
think
i
better
wait
here
i
said
if
they
came
back
and
found
me
gone
it
would
be
too
complicated
she
agreed
but
she
little
guessed
how
much
more
complicated
it
would
be
to
take
a
train
for
anywhere
without
any
pennies
if
i
had
money
i
would
go
to
and
not
to
bideford
at
least
that
is
the
way
i
feel
now
but
i
suppose
i
would
for
my
obligations
to
ellaline
snapped
with
the
strain
of
the
situation
although
just
at
this
moment
they
do
seem
to
matter
it
only
deep
down
in
my
heart
that
i
know
they
do
matter
there
is
my
scrape
dearest
of
women
and
mamma
whom
i
would
select
if
i
were
able
to
choose
among
all
eligible
mothers
since
eve
up
to
date
the
situation
has
changed
in
the
least
to
the
time
of
writing
except
that
it
has
lasted
longer
and
got
frayed
round
the
edges
i
was
paid
for
including
food
and
lodging
until
after
breakfast
it
is
now
five
pouring
with
rain
howling
with
wind
and
not
only
has
nobody
come
back
to
collect
me
but
nobody
has
telephoned
or
telegraphed
i
have
eaten
or
pretended
to
eat
a
luncheon
for
which
i
have
no
money
to
pay
i
refused
tea
but
was
so
kindly
urged
that
i
had
to
reconsider
and
the
buttered
toast
of
servitude
is
at
this
moment
sticking
in
my
throat
lodged
on
the
sharp
edge
of
an
unuttered
sob
your
poor
forlorn
little
daughter
what
is
to
become
of
her
will
she
have
to
go
to
the
place
of
unclaimed
parcels
or
will
she
be
sold
as
bankrupt
stock
or
will
she
become
a
or
tweeny
in
king
arthur
castle
but
do
worry
darling
i
wo
be
such
a
beast
as
to
post
this
letter
till
something
is
settled
somehow
even
if
i
have
to
rob
the
hotel
till
there
is
nothing
to
do
except
write
for
i
ca
compose
my
mind
to
read
so
i
will
continue
recording
my
emotions
as
french
criminals
do
when
condemned
to
death
or
lovesick
ladies
when
they
have
swallowed
slow
poison
rain
worse
wind
yelling
imprecations
i
sit
in
the
hall
as
i
ca
call
my
room
my
own
new
people
are
arriving
they
look
but
are
probably
countesses
i
gaze
at
them
haughtily
and
try
to
appear
prosperous
i
hope
they
think
my
mother
the
duchess
is
taking
a
nap
in
our
magnificent
suite
upstairs
while
i
write
a
letter
to
my
godfather
the
prince
to
thank
him
for
his
birthday
gift
of
a
rope
of
pearls
which
reaches
to
my
knees
the
landlady
has
just
been
sympathizing
with
me
she
says
there
is
a
night
train
to
bideford
i
have
poured
cold
water
upon
the
night
train
to
bideford
and
came
near
pouring
some
hot
tears
on
the
timetable
she
kindly
brought
me
people
are
going
up
to
dress
for
dinner
they
are
creatures
but
i
do
not
love
them
the
has
just
fluttered
up
to
ask
if
i
would
like
a
smaller
table
for
dinner
no
table
would
be
too
small
for
my
appetite
i
said
darling
sir
lionel
has
come
back
for
me
alone
dripping
wet
and
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
he
did
want
me
and
he
furious
with
everybody
in
the
world
except
me
to
whom
he
is
perfectly
adorable
and
i
afraid
i
adore
him
and
we
starting
at
once
when
we
had
a
sandwich
and
coffee
ca
wait
for
dinner
everything
is
nice
i
explain
as
soon
as
i
time
to
write
your
radiant
transformation
scene
a
xxiv
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
luttrell
arms
duck
of
the
universe
five
days
since
i
wrote
and
it
seems
five
minutes
but
i
did
telegraph
with
my
last
shilling
and
even
that
would
be
rightfully
ellaline
if
the
labourer
were
worthy
of
his
hire
you
see
after
the
letter
i
had
from
her
in
torquay
when
she
wanted
money
to
go
to
scotland
with
her
new
friends
the
mcnamaras
i
very
reluctantly
screwed
my
courage
to
the
asking
point
and
got
more
out
of
sir
lionel
if
he
were
the
most
generous
man
in
the
world
he
would
have
privately
dubbed
me
oliver
twist
by
this
time
perhaps
he
has
but
i
trust
not
anyhow
i
shall
get
on
without
more
requests
i
hope
until
the
next
allowance
day
comes
round
or
until
every
pin
is
lost
and
every
hairpin
has
dropped
out
because
in
the
telegram
i
was
forced
to
be
economical
and
ran
only
to
all
well
love
much
scratched
out
as
an
extravagance
i
must
now
go
back
to
the
moment
of
sir
lionel
unexpected
almost
miraculous
appearance
at
tintagel
there
i
was
in
the
hall
scribbling
dolefully
about
my
symptoms
teuf
teuf
teuf
heard
outside
between
screeches
of
wind
in
bounces
sir
lionel
wet
as
a
merman
dripping
rivulets
at
every
step
splashing
swashing
in
his
boots
drops
dripping
from
his
eyelashes
glares
around
looking
ready
to
bite
someone
head
off
without
salt
or
sauce
sees
me
brightens
with
a
watery
gleam
comes
toward
me
rather
shy
and
stiff
yet
evidently
under
the
influence
of
emotion
of
some
sort
i
know
whether
to
expect
a
scolding
or
a
blessing
so
waited
speechless
what
a
brute
you
must
think
me
was
his
first
remark
i
drank
it
as
a
thirsty
traveller
lost
on
the
sahara
would
bolt
a
pint
of
dew
i
did
know
what
to
think
i
replied
conservatively
but
you
are
wet
are
you
am
i
he
asked
mildly
surprised
i
had
noticed
i
suppose
i
am
it
raining
i
should
think
it
was
said
i
and
then
we
both
laughed
it
is
the
nicest
thing
to
laugh
with
sir
lionel
whatever
he
might
have
done
against
me
i
forgave
him
all
instantly
never
mind
whether
i
wet
or
dry
he
went
on
whichever
i
am
it
wo
hurt
me
the
only
thing
that
has
hurt
was
thinking
of
you
being
here
abandoned
by
jove
i
been
in
a
murderous
mood
a
good
thing
you
were
back
in
bengal
said
i
mildly
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sharp
look
who
has
been
telling
you
tales
about
me
in
bengal
i
sometimes
read
newspapers
i
explained
schoolgirls
have
no
business
with
newspapers
but
hang
bengal
i
want
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
you
is
it
true
or
is
it
not
that
you
wanted
to
go
with
the
tyndals
in
their
motor
i
wanted
to
if
you
wanted
me
to
i
did
i
hated
the
idea
but
of
course
if
you
did
i
hated
the
idea
but
i
thought
your
motor
was
too
full
for
such
hilly
country
dearest
i
longed
to
tell
him
who
had
said
that
had
said
etc
but
i
promised
and
one
must
keep
one
promises
even
to
cats
my
dear
child
sir
lionel
burst
out
little
girls
should
do
too
much
independent
thinking
it
bad
for
their
health
and
their
guardians
tempers
if
my
motor
had
been
too
full
for
hilly
country
you
would
have
been
the
jonah
to
cast
into
the
sea
nick
would
have
been
fed
to
the
whales
but
the
idea
was
ridiculous
ridiculous
i
was
so
happy
i
did
even
want
to
defend
myself
i
understood
most
of
the
mystery
now
i
suppose
it
a
compliment
to
a
girl
if
a
woman
of
the
world
wants
to
get
rid
of
her
anyhow
i
consoled
myself
for
hours
of
misery
by
laying
that
flattering
unction
to
my
soul
if
i
had
liked
i
could
have
unravelled
the
whole
tangle
for
sir
lionel
still
puzzled
mind
but
if
i
had
done
so
i
should
have
been
returning
for
so
i
pretended
to
be
lost
in
it
my
lord
and
indeed
it
was
true
that
i
could
understand
why
the
tyndals
had
failed
me
sir
lionel
explained
that
just
before
reaching
bideford
the
silencer
worked
loose
and
so
got
upon
norton
nerves
that
apollo
was
stopped
in
the
pouring
rain
for
young
nick
to
right
the
wrong
as
if
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
proverb
the
more
haste
the
less
speed
in
his
hurry
poor
buddha
burnt
his
hand
while
he
was
wringing
it
like
a
distracted
goblin
along
came
the
tyndal
car
which
had
left
tintagel
about
half
an
hour
after
apollo
to
sir
lionel
amazement
no
me
questions
on
his
part
according
to
him
idiotic
answers
on
the
part
of
the
tyndals
had
thought
of
course
i
was
going
with
them
had
thought
that
i
changed
my
mind
and
gone
earlier
with
him
everybody
confused
apologetic
repeating
the
same
silly
excuses
over
and
over
three
or
four
times
nobody
showing
the
slightest
sign
of
having
a
remnant
of
common
sense
by
jove
i
could
have
cheerfully
executed
the
lot
of
them
all
but
the
boy
who
seemed
to
have
some
glimmerings
of
sanity
grumbled
sir
lionel
he
had
wanted
to
run
up
and
knock
at
your
door
to
make
sure
you
really
had
gone
but
somebody
he
began
to
say
who
when
tyndal
stepped
on
his
foot
forbade
him
to
do
it
i
think
i
can
guess
who
the
somebody
was
ca
you
though
i
do
see
what
arguments
she
can
have
used
to
persuade
the
really
tyndals
to
abandon
me
the
rest
of
the
story
is
that
when
sir
lionel
found
i
had
been
left
behind
he
said
he
would
at
once
turn
back
and
fetch
me
judging
from
one
or
two
things
he
let
slip
inadvertently
i
fancy
he
wanted
emily
to
come
with
him
but
she
drew
the
line
at
chaperoning
in
wet
weather
and
missing
her
tea
she
proposed
telegraphing
for
me
to
come
on
by
rail
sir
lionel
would
hear
of
my
making
such
a
journey
unaccompanied
me
a
simple
little
french
schoolgirl
who
had
never
travelled
alone
in
her
life
then
senter
kind
creature
volunteered
to
be
his
companion
if
he
must
return
but
sir
lionel
firmly
refused
the
unselfish
offer
saying
he
would
for
the
world
put
her
to
so
much
unnecessary
trouble
nick
he
would
have
brought
but
the
unfortunate
brown
image
was
suffering
so
much
pain
from
his
burnt
hand
that
the
only
humane
thing
to
do
was
to
drive
him
to
a
doctor
which
was
exactly
what
sir
lionel
did
rooms
were
already
engaged
at
the
royal
hotel
he
dumped
out
emily
senter
and
the
luggage
there
left
young
nick
having
his
hand
treated
and
without
so
much
as
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
hotel
turned
apollo
bright
bonnet
toward
tintagel
and
me
rain
was
coming
down
in
floods
he
said
nothing
about
that
but
i
knew
the
storm
drew
down
twilight
like
the
lid
of
a
box
the
road
was
deep
in
mud
everything
that
could
happen
to
delay
the
car
did
happen
once
sir
lionel
had
to
mend
a
tire
himself
and
almost
wished
he
had
made
young
nick
disgorge
the
stolen
tool
he
ought
to
have
arrived
at
tintagel
an
hour
before
he
did
but
here
he
was
at
last
and
would
i
have
a
sandwich
and
then
start
or
would
i
prefer
to
wait
for
dinner
i
snatched
at
the
sandwich
idea
and
his
eye
brightened
he
said
he
only
wet
for
everything
was
waterproof
and
he
was
right
as
rain
which
sounded
too
appropriate
to
be
comfortable
we
ate
as
the
israelites
of
old
in
passover
days
figuratively
with
our
staves
in
our
hands
at
least
i
had
a
bag
in
mine
and
sir
lionel
a
road
book
because
he
lost
his
way
once
in
his
haste
and
did
want
to
make
further
mistakes
by
the
time
we
were
ready
to
start
it
was
as
if
merlin
had
woven
an
enchantment
of
invisibility
not
only
over
the
castle
ruins
but
over
the
whole
landscape
which
was
blotted
out
behind
a
white
avalanche
of
rain
the
wind
howled
mingling
with
the
boom
of
the
sea
and
altogether
it
was
such
a
bewitched
walpurgis
world
that
i
tingled
with
excitement
sir
lionel
wanted
to
put
me
inside
the
car
but
i
pleaded
that
i
had
been
so
lonely
and
sad
all
day
i
must
be
close
to
someone
now
this
plea
instantly
broke
down
his
determination
which
had
been
very
and
firm
till
i
happened
to
think
of
that
argument
he
knew
my
coat
to
be
waterproof
because
he
chose
it
himself
in
london
and
i
tied
on
a
perfectly
sweet
which
i
never
needed
before
because
this
was
the
only
real
storm
we
had
it
is
a
crimson
hood
and
i
knew
i
was
nice
in
it
from
the
look
of
sir
lionel
eyes
this
was
my
first
night
run
in
the
car
and
the
first
time
since
starting
on
the
tour
that
i
sat
on
the
front
seat
by
his
side
early
as
it
was
it
made
night
and
sir
lionel
lit
the
great
lamps
instantly
it
was
as
if
a
curtain
of
darkness
unrolled
on
either
side
leaving
only
the
road
clear
and
pale
spouting
mud
and
the
rain
in
front
like
a
silver
veil
floating
across
black
velvet
i
sat
close
to
sir
lionel
i
ca
tell
you
how
good
the
sense
of
his
nearness
and
protection
was
and
how
glad
i
felt
to
know
that
he
had
really
wanted
to
send
me
away
from
him
i
would
have
given
up
anything
no
else
in
the
world
just
then
for
the
sake
of
that
knowledge
except
of
course
your
dear
love
we
did
talk
much
but
he
is
one
of
those
men
to
whom
you
do
need
to
talk
the
silence
was
like
that
unerring
kind
of
speech
when
you
ca
say
the
wrong
thing
if
you
try
and
if
sir
lionel
had
said
in
the
wind
and
darkness
i
have
got
to
drive
the
car
into
the
sea
and
you
and
i
must
die
together
in
five
minutes
i
should
have
answered
very
well
with
you
i
not
afraid
and
it
would
have
been
true
the
hills
looked
stupendous
before
we
quite
came
to
them
great
bunchy
black
humps
of
night
but
they
seemed
to
kneel
like
docile
elephants
as
we
drew
near
to
let
apollo
mount
upon
their
backs
we
passed
lovely
old
cottages
which
in
the
strange
white
light
of
our
bleriots
looked
flat
as
stage
scenery
against
that
of
inky
velvet
it
was
like
motoring
in
a
dream
one
of
those
dreams
born
before
you
quite
dropped
asleep
while
your
eyes
are
still
open
we
tore
through
boscastle
and
on
to
bude
along
an
empty
road
with
the
trees
flying
by
like
torn
black
flags
and
the
rain
giving
a
glimpse
now
and
then
of
tall
cliffs
as
its
veil
blew
aside
i
was
never
so
happy
in
my
life
and
when
i
just
could
help
saying
so
to
sir
lionel
what
do
you
suppose
he
answered
that
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
and
then
he
added
good
girl
grand
little
sportswoman
i
proud
of
you
presently
once
in
a
while
the
dazzling
radiance
of
our
lamps
would
die
down
and
threaten
to
fail
at
last
it
did
fail
altogether
and
we
were
blotted
out
in
the
night
as
if
we
had
suddenly
ceased
to
exist
carbide
all
used
up
explained
sir
lionel
by
this
time
we
were
near
hartland
point
the
promontory
of
hercules
for
the
ancients
and
sir
lionel
said
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
crawl
on
slowly
until
we
should
come
to
clovelly
there
we
could
leave
the
car
at
the
top
of
the
hill
go
down
to
the
village
rouse
someone
at
a
hotel
get
hot
coffee
and
wait
until
dawn
when
the
lamps
would
no
longer
be
needed
we
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
night
except
a
glimmer
of
road
between
dark
banks
until
suddenly
looking
far
down
toward
the
moaning
sea
we
caught
sight
of
a
few
lights
like
yellow
stars
which
seemed
to
have
been
tossed
over
a
precipice
and
to
have
caught
on
a
steep
hillside
as
they
rolled
that
clovelly
said
sir
lionel
he
stopped
the
car
on
a
kind
of
natural
plateau
and
lifted
me
lightly
down
so
that
i
should
splash
into
unseen
abysses
of
mud
apollo
would
be
safe
there
he
said
though
in
old
days
the
folk
of
clovelly
used
to
be
not
only
desperate
smugglers
but
wreckers
and
would
entice
ships
upon
the
rocks
by
means
of
they
were
very
different
now
and
as
honest
and
as
any
people
in
the
world
there
was
no
dawn
yet
but
the
wind
had
dropped
a
little
and
the
long
crystal
spears
of
rain
seemed
to
bring
with
them
an
evanescent
ethereal
glitter
reflected
from
unseen
stars
above
the
clouds
the
trembling
silver
haze
dimly
showed
us
how
to
pick
our
way
down
a
steep
narrow
street
of
steps
over
which
fountains
of
water
played
and
swirled
there
were
lights
of
boats
in
a
little
harbour
far
far
below
and
the
extraordinary
village
of
tiny
white
houses
appeared
to
have
tumbled
down
hill
like
a
broken
string
of
pearls
fallen
from
a
goddess
neck
sir
lionel
held
my
arm
to
keep
me
from
tripping
and
we
descended
the
steps
slowly
the
rain
that
sprayed
against
our
faces
smelling
salt
as
the
sea
its
briny
tang
mingling
with
the
fragrance
of
honeysuckle
and
fuchsias
the
combination
distilled
by
the
night
was
intoxicating
and
if
i
ever
smell
it
again
even
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
my
thoughts
will
run
back
to
sir
lionel
and
the
fairy
village
of
clovelly
down
the
cleft
in
the
cliff
which
is
clovelly
one
street
we
stopped
at
a
house
where
a
faint
light
burned
sleepily
it
was
the
new
inn
and
when
sir
lionel
knocked
loudly
i
was
doubtful
as
to
the
reception
we
were
likely
to
have
at
such
an
hour
but
i
need
have
worried
in
devon
even
if
you
wake
people
out
of
pleasant
dreams
to
disagreeable
realities
and
demand
coffee
and
trail
wet
marks
over
their
clean
floors
they
are
kind
and
friendly
a
delightful
man
let
us
in
and
instead
of
scolding
pitied
us
a
great
deal
more
than
i
at
any
rate
needed
to
be
pitied
he
lit
lights
and
we
saw
a
quaint
room
whose
shadows
threw
out
unexpected
gleams
of
polished
brass
and
blues
and
pinks
of
old
china
though
the
calendar
said
august
the
temperature
talked
it
down
and
insisted
on
november
so
an
invitation
into
a
clean
warm
kitchen
was
acceptable
the
nice
man
poked
up
the
dying
fire
put
on
wood
and
coals
and
soon
got
a
kettle
of
water
to
boiling
we
should
have
some
good
hot
coffee
he
cheerily
promised
before
we
could
say
jack
robinson
but
when
it
leaked
out
that
we
had
had
no
dinner
except
a
sandwich
at
tintagel
and
nothing
since
his
warm
devonshire
heart
yearned
over
us
and
to
the
hot
coffee
he
added
eggs
and
bacon
while
the
dear
things
fizzled
and
bubbled
we
were
allowed
to
sit
by
the
stove
and
toast
our
feet
and
if
anything
could
have
smelled
more
heavenly
than
the
salt
rain
and
sweet
honeysuckle
out
of
doors
it
would
have
been
the
eggs
and
bacon
in
the
new
inn
kitchen
we
begged
to
eat
in
the
kitchen
too
and
even
that
was
permitted
us
at
a
table
spread
with
a
clean
cloth
which
must
have
been
put
away
in
a
lavender
cupboard
by
the
time
the
coffee
with
foaming
hot
milk
and
the
sizzling
eggs
and
bacon
were
ready
the
early
daylight
was
blue
on
the
window
panes
the
rain
had
stopped
with
the
first
hint
of
sunrise
and
in
clovelly
at
least
clovelly
means
shut
in
valley
a
name
not
worthy
of
its
elfin
charm
the
wind
had
gone
to
sleep
i
do
know
how
much
sir
lionel
suggested
paying
for
that
breakfast
but
it
must
have
been
something
out
of
the
way
for
our
devonshire
benefactor
protested
that
it
was
far
too
much
he
would
accept
the
regular
price
and
no
more
why
we
had
only
got
him
up
an
hour
before
his
usual
time
that
was
nothing
it
would
do
him
good
and
he
would
have
no
extra
pay
warm
comfortable
and
refreshed
sir
lionel
and
i
bade
our
host
meaning
to
continue
our
journey
to
bideford
but
what
we
saw
outside
was
too
beautiful
to
turn
our
backs
upon
in
that
unappreciative
summary
fashion
it
was
not
sunrise
yet
but
was
just
going
to
be
sunrise
and
the
world
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
it
hushed
and
expectant
the
white
village
glimmered
in
the
pearly
light
like
a
waterfall
arrested
in
its
rush
down
a
cleft
in
a
hill
not
having
seen
clovelly
you
may
think
that
a
simile
but
really
it
is
if
a
young
cataract
could
be
turned
into
a
village
that
would
be
clovelly
the
marvellous
little
place
is
absolutely
unique
yet
if
one
could
liken
it
to
anything
else
on
earth
it
might
be
to
a
corner
of
mont
michel
or
a
bit
of
old
bellagio
going
down
to
the
sea
and
certainly
it
is
more
italian
than
english
in
atmosphere
and
colouring
only
it
is
perfectly
clean
as
clean
as
a
toy
or
a
dutch
village
so
part
of
the
atmosphere
is
entirely
italian
i
even
saw
pots
and
if
that
is
like
broek
in
waterland
what
is
down
in
the
harbour
the
fishing
boats
lay
like
a
flock
of
resting
birds
and
as
we
descended
the
cobbled
steps
of
the
street
to
go
to
the
shore
the
early
morning
donkeys
began
to
come
up
laden
with
heavy
bags
and
panniers
just
as
you
and
i
saw
them
in
italy
and
driven
by
just
such
boys
and
old
men
as
i
remember
there
picturesque
one
or
two
with
red
caps
the
doors
of
the
little
houses
huddled
on
either
side
opened
here
and
there
up
and
down
the
path
giving
glimpses
of
pretty
neat
interiors
bits
of
old
furniture
the
glint
of
a
copper
kettle
a
brass
jug
or
a
bit
of
mended
blue
china
a
gossipy
devonshire
cat
came
out
and
begged
for
caresses
mewing
the
news
of
the
night
such
a
chatty
creature
and
down
on
the
beach
we
made
friends
with
the
oldest
man
of
the
village
born
in
he
was
a
handsome
old
fellow
with
pathetic
faded
eyes
in
a
tanned
ruddy
face
and
the
queer
little
harbour
everything
is
little
at
clovelly
except
the
inhabitants
with
its
rustic
sort
of
pier
and
fishing
boats
looked
as
if
it
had
been
designed
entirely
as
a
background
for
him
however
it
much
more
antique
even
than
he
six
hundred
years
old
instead
of
something
short
of
a
hundred
and
made
by
the
famous
carey
family
we
stopped
there
talking
to
the
ancient
hearing
how
the
clovelly
fishermen
go
out
with
black
nets
by
day
in
good
weather
and
at
night
with
white
ones
to
attract
the
fish
that
is
trew
miss
said
he
when
i
laughed
thinking
it
a
joke
i
love
the
devonshire
way
of
saying
true
and
other
words
that
rhyme
their
soft
voices
are
as
gentle
as
kindly
as
the
murmur
of
their
own
blue
sea
as
we
mounted
the
path
to
the
top
of
clovelly
to
go
back
to
apollo
again
the
sun
came
up
out
of
the
sea
where
the
blue
line
of
water
marked
the
edge
of
the
world
and
spilt
floods
of
gold
over
it
like
a
tilted
christening
cup
we
turned
and
stood
still
to
watch
the
day
born
of
dawn
and
i
feel
sure
that
if
we
had
come
to
clovelly
to
spend
several
weeks
i
could
never
have
learned
to
know
the
place
as
i
had
divined
it
in
this
adventure
you
seem
to
learn
more
about
a
flower
by
inhaling
its
perfume
after
rain
do
you
think
than
by
dissecting
it
petal
by
petal
i
fancy
there
is
something
like
that
in
getting
the
feeling
and
impression
of
places
at
their
best
by
sudden
revelations
of
course
i
want
to
go
back
to
clovelly
but
not
with
any
of
the
nortons
of
the
world
i
could
bear
to
do
that
after
being
alone
there
with
sir
lionel
while
one
heart
is
thrilled
by
exquisite
sights
and
the
ineffable
thoughts
born
of
them
one
knows
poor
emily
is
wondering
whether
the
servants
are
looking
after
things
properly
at
home
and
that
very
knowledge
is
apt
to
slam
down
an
iron
shutter
in
one
soul
it
must
have
been
about
five
when
we
took
our
places
in
the
car
again
we
had
only
eleven
miles
run
to
bideford
and
i
wished
them
twice
eleven
for
surely
they
are
among
the
most
beautiful
miles
in
england
no
wonder
people
believe
in
fairies
in
this
part
of
the
world
it
would
be
ungrateful
if
they
did
as
the
sun
climbed
the
brown
wood
roads
were
inlaid
with
gold
in
wavy
patterns
from
our
heights
now
and
again
we
caught
glimpses
of
clovelly
down
its
deep
ravines
the
hobby
drive
which
belongs
to
clovelly
court
is
almost
more
exquisite
than
buckland
chase
on
the
way
to
dartmoor
if
you
had
been
there
with
me
you
would
know
i
could
give
it
higher
praise
and
how
i
wish
you
been
how
i
wish
you
could
see
these
english
woods
they
have
such
an
air
of
dainty
gaiety
very
different
from
austrian
or
german
or
french
forests
and
though
their
elms
and
oaks
and
beeches
are
often
giants
they
seem
dedicated
to
the
spirit
of
youth
their
shadows
are
never
black
but
only
a
darker
green
or
translucent
gray
and
part
of
their
charm
is
a
frivolousness
which
comes
i
think
from
their
ruffly
green
other
woods
have
no
their
ankles
are
mournfully
bare
and
their
stockings
dark
in
the
woods
of
the
hobby
drive
the
bracken
was
like
elfin
plumes
each
stone
wrapped
in
moss
was
a
lump
of
silver
coated
with
verdigris
distant
cliffs
seen
between
the
trees
were
cut
out
of
jade
against
a
sea
of
changing
opal
and
in
the
high
of
the
latticed
beeches
a
concert
of
birds
was
fluting
is
gallantry
bower
a
fine
name
at
first
thought
it
would
appear
an
inappropriate
one
for
it
a
sheer
cliff
overlooking
the
sea
on
one
side
and
a
vast
sweep
of
woodland
on
the
other
but
i
can
make
it
seem
appropriate
by
picturing
some
wild
brave
sailor
making
love
to
his
sweetheart
there
and
telling
her
about
the
sea
her
only
rival
in
his
love
no
doubt
it
a
corruption
of
some
old
cornish
name
and
i
refuse
to
accept
it
as
a
lover
leap
though
such
a
legend
has
grown
up
around
it
i
tired
of
lover
leaps
the
whole
coast
as
we
swept
round
was
a
vast
golden
sickle
in
the
early
morning
light
and
everything
was
so
beautiful
that
the
door
of
my
heart
swung
wide
open
no
arm
would
have
been
strong
enough
to
push
it
shut
not
even
senter
instead
of
feeling
angry
with
her
as
we
drew
near
bideford
i
was
grateful
for
the
adventure
she
had
indirectly
given
me
the
servants
of
the
royal
hotel
were
just
waking
up
but
of
course
being
devonshire
people
instead
of
being
cross
they
were
delightfully
and
smiling
i
was
shown
to
a
pleasant
room
and
provided
with
a
hot
bath
which
with
nearly
a
whole
bottle
of
eau
de
cologne
extravagantly
emptied
into
it
made
me
feel
as
if
i
had
had
a
refreshing
eight
hours
sleep
already
it
seemed
as
if
the
night
experience
had
been
a
dream
dreamed
in
that
sleep
but
i
was
glad
glad
it
was
real
and
not
a
dream
something
i
had
lived
through
by
sir
lionel
side
a
clear
memory
to
remain
like
a
happy
island
in
the
sea
of
life
whatever
the
future
weather
i
dressed
slowly
not
wanting
even
forty
winks
and
about
eight
emily
knocked
at
my
door
she
had
been
worried
she
said
and
not
able
to
sleep
fearing
accidents
waking
now
and
then
to
listen
for
the
sound
of
a
car
poor
dear
she
would
know
apollo
noble
voice
from
the
threepenny
thrum
of
a
motor
bicycle
but
she
was
kind
and
solicitous
though
i
think
a
little
shocked
to
find
my
vitality
in
such
a
state
of
effervescence
she
would
have
approved
of
me
if
i
had
been
a
draggled
wreck
but
even
as
it
was
she
felt
it
worth
while
to
explain
why
she
had
accompanied
her
brother
she
would
have
proposed
doing
so
she
assured
me
but
her
neuralgia
had
been
very
trying
yesterday
owing
to
the
bad
weather
and
east
wind
she
feared
to
be
more
trouble
than
assistance
to
sir
lionel
and
as
he
was
my
guardian
i
was
sufficiently
chaperoned
by
him
any
expert
in
etiquette
would
confirm
her
in
that
opinion
she
anxiously
added
nevertheless
when
i
told
her
about
our
stop
at
clovelly
she
shook
her
head
and
intimated
that
perhaps
it
had
better
not
be
referred
to
in
public
i
suppose
by
in
public
she
meant
before
the
tyndals
and
senter
at
nine
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
fair
gwendolen
again
in
one
of
the
most
remarkable
rooms
you
can
imagine
sir
lionel
had
engaged
it
in
advance
to
be
our
private
but
it
is
as
celebrated
as
it
is
interesting
only
think
charles
kingsley
wrote
westward
ho
in
it
and
it
is
such
a
quaint
and
beautiful
room
it
must
have
given
him
inspiration
you
see
the
hotel
used
to
be
the
house
of
a
merchant
prince
who
was
a
great
importer
of
tobacco
in
queen
elizabeth
days
so
it
is
strange
that
it
should
have
many
fine
rooms
but
the
one
where
kingsley
wrote
is
the
best
it
sad
that
the
oak
panelling
should
be
ruined
with
paint
and
varnish
but
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
could
spoil
the
ceiling
which
is
the
famous
feature
the
merchant
prince
hired
two
italians
to
come
to
england
and
make
the
wonderful
mouldings
by
hand
that
was
long
before
the
days
of
cement
so
the
fantastic
shapes
had
to
be
fastened
to
each
other
and
the
ceiling
with
copper
wire
when
the
skilled
workmen
had
finished
their
fruits
and
flowers
and
leaves
and
all
the
weird
fancies
which
signified
the
evolution
of
man
the
canny
merchant
prince
promptly
packed
the
italians
back
again
to
their
native
land
lest
other
merchant
princes
should
employ
them
to
repeat
the
marvellous
ceiling
for
their
houses
by
this
thoughtful
act
he
secured
for
himself
the
one
and
only
specimen
of
the
kind
and
to
this
day
nobody
has
ever
been
able
to
copy
it
though
the
attempt
has
often
been
made
the
marvellous
part
is
the
startlingly
high
relief
of
the
mouldings
and
the
quaintness
of
the
evolutionary
ideas
all
those
centuries
before
darwin
it
was
rather
disappointing
to
find
out
that
the
beautiful
ceiling
had
nothing
to
do
with
charles
kingsley
wish
to
use
the
room
as
a
study
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
present
landlord
grandfather
who
owned
a
quantity
of
rare
old
books
records
of
bideford
past
and
kingsley
wanted
to
refer
to
them
but
their
owner
valued
them
too
much
to
lend
even
to
such
a
man
as
charles
kingsley
you
must
come
and
write
in
the
room
said
he
so
kingsley
came
and
wrote
in
the
room
and
liked
it
and
the
books
so
much
that
he
gave
a
glowing
account
of
both
to
froude
who
presently
arrived
and
used
the
remarkable
room
for
study
too
the
books
are
there
still
carefully
put
away
and
a
portrait
of
the
good
mayor
of
westward
ho
the
novel
not
its
namesake
town
which
was
found
in
the
cellar
with
vandyck
name
faintly
traced
on
it
hangs
opposite
the
fireplace
the
great
treasure
of
the
room
though
after
the
ceiling
is
a
letter
from
kingsley
framed
protected
with
glass
and
lying
on
a
table
senter
looked
almost
green
when
she
beheld
me
the
picture
of
health
and
joy
and
saw
on
what
good
terms
i
was
with
sir
lionel
i
am
certain
dear
that
she
wants
to
marry
him
and
i
ca
think
capable
of
appreciating
such
a
man
so
it
must
be
for
his
money
a
sportin
huntin
what
sort
of
fellow
would
please
her
better
if
all
else
were
suitable
because
she
could
turn
him
round
her
finger
and
that
neither
she
nor
anybody
else
can
ever
do
with
sir
lionel
though
he
is
pathetically
chivalrous
where
women
are
concerned
and
still
more
pathetically
credulous
i
remember
so
well
your
reading
westward
ho
aloud
to
me
when
i
was
about
ten
and
had
been
ill
i
associate
it
with
the
joy
of
getting
well
it
made
me
feel
proud
of
my
devonshire
ancestors
even
then
and
it
makes
me
more
proud
now
for
i
been
reading
the
book
for
the
second
time
in
it
like
the
bible
almost
in
bideford
i
should
pity
the
person
who
dared
pick
a
flaw
in
the
story
in
the
hearing
of
a
bideford
man
woman
or
child
why
i
believe
even
a
bideford
dog
would
understand
the
insult
and
snap
it
a
great
and
rather
original
compliment
to
name
a
town
in
honour
of
a
book
but
westward
ho
the
novel
is
worthy
of
a
finer
namesake
of
course
rudyard
kipling
having
been
to
school
in
westward
ho
makes
the
place
more
interesting
than
it
ever
could
have
been
of
itself
in
spite
of
its
glorious
neighbour
the
sea
but
bideford
is
a
delightful
place
dad
used
to
say
that
no
men
in
the
world
could
beat
the
men
of
devon
for
courage
and
that
bideford
men
were
amongst
the
bravest
of
all
as
you
and
i
would
have
known
from
westward
ho
even
if
we
never
read
history
it
looks
an
town
almost
unspoiled
even
now
with
its
bridge
on
arches
its
steeply
sloping
streets
its
quay
and
its
quaint
pink
and
green
houses
by
the
river
in
the
old
ship
tavern
the
brotherhood
of
the
rose
was
founded
you
remember
and
sir
richard
grenville
dear
sir
richard
had
his
house
where
the
castle
inn
stands
now
i
took
a
long
walk
with
sir
lionel
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
senter
on
the
quay
along
the
riverside
and
there
are
some
guns
there
which
they
say
were
lost
from
the
spanish
armada
while
we
were
walking
who
should
join
us
but
dick
burden
back
from
scotland
it
appears
that
he
arrived
at
tintagel
last
night
only
a
little
while
after
sir
lionel
and
i
had
left
in
the
car
he
expected
to
be
earlier
but
he
took
trains
which
looked
promising
on
and
missed
connection
i
ca
be
thankful
enough
he
arrive
before
we
started
instead
of
after
for
of
course
sir
lionel
would
have
had
to
ask
him
to
come
with
us
and
that
would
have
spoiled
everything
there
would
have
been
no
beautiful
memory
island
in
my
sea
do
you
know
i
had
almost
forgotten
dick
for
two
or
three
days
he
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
my
life
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
and
it
was
quite
a
mental
shock
to
meet
him
on
the
quay
at
bideford
he
seem
to
be
in
the
picture
at
all
whereas
sir
lionel
is
always
in
it
whatever
or
whenever
it
may
be
we
sir
lionel
and
i
asked
politely
for
his
mother
health
and
he
answered
apparently
without
thinking
mother
oh
she
all
right
then
he
evidently
remembered
that
he
been
sent
for
because
she
was
ill
and
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
of
his
he
explained
that
when
he
arrived
he
found
her
already
better
though
nervous
and
that
she
was
practically
cured
but
i
saw
him
and
his
aunt
exchange
a
look
i
wonder
if
it
meant
that
the
mother
has
any
weird
sort
of
disease
contagious
perhaps
i
do
hope
it
is
anything
i
have
had
it
would
be
so
awkward
to
come
down
with
it
now
though
the
sight
of
dick
with
mumps
for
instance
would
repay
me
for
a
good
deal
senter
room
at
bideford
adjoined
mine
with
a
locked
door
between
and
that
night
for
half
an
hour
after
i
gone
to
bed
i
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
hers
and
dick
they
seemed
to
be
tremendously
in
earnest
about
something
luckily
i
could
hear
a
word
they
said
otherwise
i
should
have
had
the
bother
of
stopping
my
ears
but
i
could
help
knowing
that
there
was
a
heated
argument
aunt
gwen
protesting
nephew
dick
insisting
and
after
stress
and
storm
a
final
understanding
arrived
at
which
apparently
satisfied
both
such
a
splendid
road
it
was
going
out
of
bideford
with
views
of
sea
and
river
the
distant
shore
levels
indigo
and
a
fiery
golden
light
like
spilt
sherry
on
the
livid
green
of
the
grass
the
sails
of
fishing
boats
from
instow
rose
from
dark
ruffled
waters
white
as
lily
petals
and
out
of
heavy
purple
clouds
poured
streams
of
flaming
light
as
if
bags
loaded
with
gold
dust
had
burst
with
their
own
weight
long
sand
flats
gleamed
red
as
coral
with
some
sea
plant
and
the
backs
of
leaves
on
bush
and
hedge
were
all
dull
silver
under
the
shadows
of
racing
clouds
that
tore
at
thousand
speed
over
golden
meadows
it
was
an
extraordinary
but
thoroughly
english
effect
and
is
it
sad
the
grazing
cows
and
sheep
we
passed
never
once
looked
up
or
cared
but
the
people
the
charming
peasants
of
devon
cared
they
looked
up
and
smiled
at
their
sky
as
if
it
gave
them
good
thoughts
and
everyone
on
foot
or
in
wagon
was
so
polite
to
us
flashing
such
kind
looks
from
beautiful
eyes
that
we
had
the
sensation
of
tasting
honey
it
kept
us
busy
returning
the
bows
of
the
handsome
courteous
people
and
altogether
it
was
like
a
royal
progress
poor
apollo
is
used
to
such
treatment
out
of
devonshire
and
cornwall
i
can
tell
you
he
always
does
his
best
to
be
considerate
yet
he
is
often
misunderstood
being
nothing
but
a
whom
nobody
loves
it
was
a
joy
to
see
merry
devonshire
children
flinging
themselves
into
our
dust
as
if
it
were
perfumed
spray
and
playing
that
they
too
were
such
a
nice
change
after
some
counties
where
we
had
behaved
beautifully
without
any
appreciation
to
feel
that
for
once
we
gave
pleasure
to
some
one
as
we
passed
in
and
out
of
their
obscure
little
lives
the
wind
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
honeysuckle
and
the
sweet
yellow
hay
which
blew
out
of
carts
to
twine
like
gold
webbing
on
flowery
hedges
and
on
the
crimson
hollyhocks
that
rose
like
straight
tall
flames
against
whitewashed
walls
even
the
droves
of
sheep
we
met
were
more
polite
than
sheep
for
instead
of
blocking
our
way
obstinately
keeping
just
in
front
so
that
we
could
pass
on
neither
side
they
thoughtfully
charged
into
village
inns
and
cottage
gardens
but
of
course
you
ca
expect
pink
sheep
to
act
like
ordinary
these
devonshire
creatures
look
exactly
like
a
lot
of
pink
wool
mats
blowing
away
probably
they
are
pixie
led
for
devonshire
simply
swarms
with
pixies
if
you
are
a
human
being
and
happen
to
put
your
stockings
on
wrong
side
out
they
get
power
over
you
at
once
but
i
do
know
what
the
trick
is
if
you
are
a
sheep
we
ran
above
a
great
ravine
at
barnstaple
and
the
scene
was
so
fine
that
i
gave
mental
thanks
to
the
glaciers
which
in
the
ice
age
had
so
tastefully
scooped
out
all
this
into
graceful
curves
and
majestic
cliffs
after
leaving
the
sea
behind
us
we
were
ringed
in
swallowed
up
among
lovely
gracious
hills
which
hid
the
world
from
us
us
from
the
world
for
miles
upon
miles
a
road
writhed
smoothly
down
the
sides
of
these
hills
until
at
last
after
a
wildly
exhilarating
run
we
found
ourselves
in
a
peaceful
green
valley
the
hobby
drive
was
no
more
beautiful
and
not
half
so
exciting
but
by
now
we
were
coming
to
the
switzerland
of
england
as
we
sped
on
great
downs
rolled
up
behind
us
and
towered
above
our
heads
like
the
crests
of
huge
green
waves
at
breaking
point
even
the
sky
suited
itself
to
the
country
here
forming
bigger
more
tumbled
clouds
than
elsewhere
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
american
goldenrod
such
as
i
used
to
gather
as
a
child
growing
quite
at
home
among
yellow
daisies
there
was
a
tremendous
hill
wriggling
down
with
wicked
twists
to
lynton
and
in
the
middle
we
met
a
car
that
had
torn
off
all
its
tires
sir
lionel
asked
if
we
could
do
anything
but
the
chauffeur
was
so
disgusted
with
life
that
though
he
snapped
out
no
thank
you
his
eyes
said
damn
at
lynton
we
stopped
at
a
hotel
like
an
exaggerated
glorified
cottage
with
a
thatched
roof
and
a
veranda
running
all
round
it
stands
in
a
big
perfumed
garden
and
from
the
windows
and
that
quaint
veranda
you
can
look
over
the
sea
to
the
welsh
coast
whence
at
evening
two
blazing
eyes
of
light
watch
you
across
the
blue
water
sir
lionel
had
meant
to
stay
only
one
night
at
the
cottage
hotel
but
lynton
was
beautiful
with
a
siren
beauty
that
would
not
let
us
go
even
his
resolution
was
proof
against
its
witchery
so
we
stopped
two
whole
days
going
downstairs
as
i
called
it
to
lynmouth
to
see
the
old
shelley
cottage
and
lots
of
other
things
but
oh
what
a
road
from
lynton
if
a
young
fly
when
its
mother
takes
it
for
its
first
walk
down
a
wall
feels
as
i
did
crawling
to
lynmouth
both
brakes
on
i
pity
it
i
was
exactly
frightened
for
i
never
could
be
quite
with
sir
lionel
driving
but
i
was
prickly
with
awe
it
was
a
good
thing
emily
did
go
with
us
i
believe
her
poor
little
heart
would
have
burst
in
sheer
fright
and
all
the
sawdust
would
have
trickled
out
i
laughed
hysterically
when
i
saw
a
motor
garage
at
the
bottom
it
ought
to
be
a
motor
hospital
for
few
cars
can
get
down
unscathed
i
should
think
afterward
when
we
were
safely
up
again
sir
lionel
said
that
if
he
had
known
what
it
was
really
like
he
would
have
taken
senter
and
me
in
the
car
but
would
have
had
us
go
in
sir
george
newnes
lift
not
that
he
did
trust
apollo
but
he
confessed
to
being
uncomfortable
for
us
i
will
say
that
senter
behaved
well
however
and
never
emitted
one
squeak
though
her
complexion
looked
when
we
arrived
at
lynmouth
as
if
she
had
been
on
a
tossing
ship
for
weeks
up
at
lynton
the
great
thing
to
do
is
to
walk
along
the
edge
of
the
sea
cliff
to
the
valley
of
rocks
a
kind
of
nature
museum
for
statues
and
busts
of
titans
locked
in
between
castle
rock
and
the
cheesewring
it
is
a
startlingly
magnificent
walk
but
when
you
are
actually
in
the
valley
of
rocks
it
is
quite
so
wonderful
as
when
seen
from
a
distance
the
arena
itself
is
rather
like
the
backyard
of
the
gods
where
they
threw
their
broken
i
had
a
queer
feeling
of
having
been
there
before
which
i
could
understand
for
a
minute
until
a
scene
in
lorna
doone
flashed
back
to
me
and
a
young
maid
in
the
hotel
firmly
believes
that
many
of
the
fantastic
shapes
of
rock
were
once
people
who
according
to
an
old
story
were
turned
into
stone
for
behaving
irreligiously
on
sundays
yesterday
morning
we
said
to
lynton
and
sir
lionel
dick
senter
and
i
walked
to
watersmeet
emily
going
along
the
upper
road
in
the
car
with
young
nick
whose
hand
was
well
enough
to
drive
i
know
whether
dad
ever
talked
to
you
about
watersmeet
but
i
surprised
if
he
did
because
not
only
is
it
one
of
the
very
most
beautiful
beauty
spots
of
devon
but
not
far
beyond
on
the
way
to
exmoor
is
brendon
our
name
place
you
can
guess
without
my
telling
why
watersmeet
is
called
watersmeet
and
it
is
the
most
musical
meeting
you
can
imagine
rocks
on
one
side
a
wooded
hill
on
the
other
and
down
below
the
singing
river
we
walked
along
an
exquisite
path
from
watersmeet
and
all
about
i
saw
the
name
of
brendon
brendon
village
brendon
forge
and
other
brendons
i
was
so
excited
that
i
forgot
the
lethbridge
episode
and
was
on
the
point
of
exclaiming
to
sir
lionel
how
interesting
to
come
on
ancestral
home
i
wonder
what
would
have
happened
if
i
had
i
should
have
had
to
try
and
blunder
out
of
the
scrape
somehow
with
dick
eyes
on
me
sparkling
with
mischief
and
senter
critical
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
tyndals
left
us
at
bideford
having
no
excuse
to
cling
even
if
they
wanted
to
because
they
had
done
exmoor
already
but
since
the
evening
when
tyndal
tried
to
pump
me
about
venice
dear
gwendolen
has
been
restless
and
suspicious
she
suspect
the
truth
of
course
unless
dick
has
told
her
which
i
sure
he
has
for
his
own
sake
but
she
suspects
something
she
has
a
common
enough
mind
to
spring
to
some
horrid
conclusion
such
as
my
having
been
secretly
in
venice
with
objectionable
people
perhaps
she
thinks
me
privately
married
i
sure
she
be
delighted
if
that
were
the
truth
because
then
dick
and
sir
lionel
would
both
be
safe
as
we
walked
dick
kept
trying
to
get
me
far
enough
away
from
the
others
to
tell
me
some
news
which
he
hurriedly
whispered
was
important
but
even
if
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
chance
which
i
did
fate
would
have
denied
it
to
him
at
rockford
inn
we
took
to
the
motor
again
finding
emily
limp
after
what
she
considered
appalling
hills
but
i
sure
they
were
nothing
to
the
one
as
this
time
apollo
himself
had
been
sent
down
in
the
big
lift
now
we
were
coming
to
and
i
was
all
eagerness
to
see
it
because
of
lorna
doone
and
because
of
things
i
heard
from
sir
lionel
as
we
walked
side
by
side
for
a
few
minutes
after
watersmeet
i
had
supposed
that
if
there
were
any
foundation
for
the
doone
story
it
was
as
slight
as
the
fabric
of
a
dream
but
he
told
me
of
a
pamphlet
he
had
read
a
short
history
of
the
original
doones
by
a
miss
ida
or
audrie
browne
only
about
eight
or
nine
years
ago
she
said
it
was
extraordinary
how
well
the
author
of
lorna
had
known
all
the
traditions
of
her
family
for
she
was
one
of
the
doones
and
that
there
really
was
a
sir
ensor
a
wild
rebellious
son
of
an
earl
of
moray
who
travelled
with
his
wife
to
exmoor
and
settled
there
in
a
rage
because
the
king
would
give
him
no
redress
against
his
elder
brother
how
does
she
spell
her
name
of
audrie
i
asked
trying
to
look
more
good
and
innocent
than
eve
could
possibly
have
been
even
in
days
he
answered
and
i
trusted
that
dick
was
too
far
behind
to
hear
what
we
were
saying
that
was
the
favourite
name
for
girls
in
the
doone
family
sir
lionel
went
on
miss
browne
thinks
sir
ensor
and
his
wife
must
have
crossed
the
quantocks
coming
here
and
have
taken
a
fancy
to
the
name
of
west
quantoxhead
patron
saint
audrie
also
spelled
that
way
it
rather
a
pretty
name
i
ventured
feeling
pink
one
of
the
prettiest
in
the
world
said
sir
lionel
i
was
pleased
though
i
ought
to
have
been
bowed
down
with
the
burden
of
borrowed
guilt
there
was
a
bad
motor
road
from
oare
to
the
gateway
of
the
moor
but
apollo
did
mind
though
i
think
he
was
glad
to
stop
outside
malmsmead
farm
where
we
had
lunch
i
suppose
you
ca
expect
such
modern
creatures
as
motors
and
chauffeurs
especially
bengali
ones
to
appreciate
farmhouses
seven
hundred
years
old
i
loved
the
place
though
and
so
did
sir
lionel
nothing
ever
tasted
better
than
the
rosy
ham
the
crisp
cottage
bread
the
thick
cream
and
wild
honey
the
farm
people
gave
us
and
the
honey
smelt
like
the
moor
which
has
just
as
individual
and
haunting
a
fragrance
as
dartmoor
though
different
after
lunch
i
wanted
to
see
the
doone
valley
and
the
ruins
of
the
doone
houses
which
by
the
way
my
namesake
miss
browne
says
were
not
the
doone
houses
but
only
the
huts
where
the
used
to
keep
stolen
cattle
so
sir
lionel
said
i
must
have
a
pony
i
was
tired
though
he
thought
i
ought
to
be
after
our
walk
but
the
idea
of
riding
a
rough
exmoor
pony
was
great
fun
and
i
did
object
sir
lionel
asked
senter
who
had
been
making
fun
of
the
doone
story
at
lunch
rather
coolly
if
she
would
care
to
go
too
and
to
his
evident
surprise
though
not
at
all
to
mine
she
instantly
said
she
would
they
have
several
ponies
at
the
farm
and
sir
lionel
hired
two
he
and
dick
meaning
to
walk
and
emily
intending
to
stop
in
the
farm
sitting
room
nodding
over
the
visitors
book
full
of
interesting
names
no
doubt
no
sooner
had
our
dear
roughly
fringed
little
beasts
been
saddled
and
we
swung
on
to
their
backs
than
there
arose
a
great
hue
and
cry
in
the
farmyard
the
stag
hunt
was
passing
such
an
excitement
you
never
saw
nobody
would
have
thought
the
same
thing
had
happened
many
times
a
year
for
generations
the
big
farmer
raced
about
waving
his
arms
and
adjuring
us
to
coom
on
the
postman
darted
by
on
his
bicycle
forgetful
of
letters
thinking
only
of
the
stag
pretty
girls
from
the
neighbouring
badgeworthy
farm
and
lorna
doone
farm
tore
up
a
hill
laughing
and
screaming
they
found
they
found
yelled
the
farm
hands
everybody
shouted
everybody
ran
or
at
least
danced
up
and
down
and
wilder
than
all
was
the
joy
of
our
exmoor
ponies
senter
and
mine
they
did
intend
to
let
the
hunt
go
by
without
them
the
stanch
little
sporting
beasts
we
had
the
least
idea
what
they
meant
to
do
or
perhaps
just
perhaps
we
might
have
stopped
them
but
before
senter
and
i
knew
what
was
happening
to
us
off
we
dashed
on
after
the
hunt
i
laughed
so
much
i
could
hardly
keep
my
seat
but
i
did
somehow
though
not
very
gracefully
and
in
about
five
minutes
sir
lionel
long
legs
had
enabled
him
to
catch
my
little
monster
which
he
grabbed
by
the
reins
and
stopped
before
we
got
mixed
up
with
the
staghounds
dick
was
slower
about
rescuing
his
aunt
because
his
legs
are
shorter
than
sir
lionel
and
her
pony
had
not
the
pleasant
disposition
of
mine
dick
vowed
afterward
that
it
spit
at
him
after
reading
lorna
the
doone
valley
looked
rather
too
gentle
with
its
grassy
slopes
to
be
satisfactory
to
my
mind
and
the
ruins
of
the
doone
houses
would
have
been
disappointing
too
if
it
had
been
for
miss
audrie
browne
tale
of
the
distant
dwellings
in
the
weir
water
valley
but
i
liked
hearing
that
all
the
hills
have
names
of
their
own
and
that
you
can
be
sure
you
are
not
going
to
fall
into
a
treacherous
bog
if
only
you
see
a
sprig
of
purple
heather
a
good
honest
plant
which
hates
anything
secret
our
ponies
did
need
the
heather
signal
though
they
shied
away
from
bogs
as
if
by
instinct
they
knew
the
moor
so
well
if
we
had
stumbled
into
a
pitfall
our
only
hope
would
have
been
to
lie
quite
flat
and
crawl
along
the
surface
with
the
same
motion
that
you
make
in
swimming
it
was
late
afternoon
by
the
time
we
had
seen
all
that
the
ponies
wanted
us
to
see
of
the
doone
valley
and
then
our
way
led
us
back
to
lynmouth
by
the
appalling
countisbury
hill
on
to
parracombe
blackmore
gate
challacombe
romantic
little
simonsbath
sacred
to
the
memory
of
sigmund
the
and
two
outlaws
of
whom
tom
faggus
of
the
strawberry
horse
was
one
and
pretty
historic
exford
and
so
to
dunster
a
beautiful
road
it
was
to
the
eye
but
not
always
to
the
tire
and
half
the
hills
of
england
seemed
to
have
lined
up
in
a
procession
but
apollo
smiled
in
his
bonnet
at
them
all
and
appeared
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
to
show
what
he
could
do
when
we
came
into
dunster
it
was
almost
dark
just
the
beautiful
hour
when
the
air
seems
to
have
turned
blue
a
deep
clear
azure
and
of
all
the
quaintly
picturesque
places
we
have
seen
i
know
at
first
glimpse
that
dunster
would
turn
out
to
be
the
best
some
towns
like
some
people
introduce
themselves
to
you
in
a
friendly
charming
way
with
no
chill
reserve
as
if
they
were
sure
you
deserved
to
see
their
best
side
it
like
that
with
dunster
anyhow
when
you
arrive
in
a
motor
and
the
first
thing
you
see
is
the
ancient
yarn
market
wooden
octagonal
perfect
then
before
you
have
recovered
from
the
effect
of
that
and
the
general
unspoiledness
of
everything
you
come
to
the
stone
porch
of
the
luttrell
arms
inn
old
and
grim
with
openings
for
crossbows
with
which
i
suppose
the
abbots
of
cleve
must
have
had
to
defend
themselves
because
the
house
once
belonged
to
them
if
you
could
see
no
other
town
but
dunster
it
would
be
worth
while
coming
across
seas
to
england
but
i
suppose
i
said
that
about
other
places
have
i
well
i
ca
help
it
if
i
have
dunster
is
absolutely
perfect
not
one
false
note
struck
in
the
quaint
music
of
its
antiquity
our
sitting
room
was
the
abbot
refectory
splendid
with
black
oak
beams
and
a
noble
ceiling
its
windows
look
into
a
wonderful
courtyard
where
you
expect
to
see
monks
walking
or
perhaps
cavaliers
and
on
the
hill
above
the
garden
there
are
earthworks
thrown
up
by
oliver
cromwell
army
during
the
siege
of
dunster
castle
the
alnwick
of
the
west
we
are
to
be
allowed
as
a
special
favour
to
see
the
inside
of
the
castle
which
towers
up
so
grandly
against
the
sky
it
is
open
to
the
public
but
sir
lionel
knows
some
relatives
of
the
owners
so
we
are
to
be
shown
round
i
say
but
if
i
do
stop
at
once
and
go
to
bed
it
will
be
ever
your
audrie
xxv
from
sir
lionel
pendragon
to
colonel
patrick
hotel
my
dear
pat
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
your
letter
just
forwarded
here
has
been
like
for
me
a
draught
from
the
cup
which
cheers
but
not
no
on
second
thoughts
i
ca
go
on
with
the
quotation
but
not
inebriates
i
rather
think
the
cup
has
inebriated
me
a
little
anyhow
it
has
made
me
a
bit
conceited
i
say
to
myself
well
if
this
is
his
opinion
of
me
why
not
believe
there
something
in
it
and
do
as
other
men
have
done
before
me
he
ought
to
be
a
judge
of
men
and
know
enough
of
women
to
have
some
idea
of
the
sort
of
person
it
would
be
possible
for
one
of
them
to
love
that
is
the
state
of
mind
to
which
you
have
brought
me
with
a
little
ink
and
a
little
paper
and
plenty
of
good
intentions
it
would
take
about
a
magnum
of
champagne
to
exhilarate
some
men
as
your
praise
and
your
advice
have
exhilarated
me
when
i
wrote
you
last
i
was
in
the
dumps
it
was
a
dull
world
and
all
the
tigers
i
had
ever
shot
were
mounted
on
sackcloth
or
stuffed
with
ashes
sounds
disgusting
does
it
but
suddenly
the
sun
broke
out
and
dulness
and
tigers
fled
together
i
suppose
i
must
always
have
been
a
creature
of
moods
and
did
know
it
for
all
it
took
to
change
gray
purgatorio
to
blue
paradiso
was
a
few
words
from
a
girl
she
said
she
did
love
dick
and
would
as
soon
marry
my
chauffeur
or
words
to
that
effect
explained
everything
or
if
she
did
explain
looked
at
me
and
i
thought
she
had
explained
i
forget
now
whether
she
did
explain
or
not
rationally
and
satisfactorily
but
it
does
matter
there
is
no
one
like
her
and
i
have
reached
a
stage
of
idiocy
concerning
her
which
i
would
blush
to
describe
i
see
now
that
the
feeling
which
a
very
young
man
hardly
out
of
boyhood
dignified
with
the
name
of
love
is
merely
a
kind
of
foundation
that
when
fallen
into
picturesque
ruin
makes
a
good
firm
flooring
of
experience
to
build
second
or
real
love
upon
i
do
know
whether
that
well
or
badly
said
but
it
expresses
my
state
of
mind
if
only
this
second
true
love
of
mine
were
not
the
daughter
of
the
first
and
false
even
now
when
i
frankly
acknowledge
to
myself
that
she
can
make
the
light
of
the
world
for
me
there
are
black
moments
when
i
distrust
her
distrust
my
impressions
of
her
and
hate
myself
for
doing
both
i
used
to
believe
so
firmly
in
heredity
that
i
ca
throw
aside
my
old
theories
in
a
moment
even
for
her
sake
how
comes
ellaline
de
nesville
and
fred
lethbridge
daughter
to
be
what
this
girl
seems
that
what
i
ask
myself
but
there
again
your
letter
helps
you
remind
me
that
our
parents
are
not
our
only
ancestors
but
enough
of
all
this
rhapsodizing
and
doubting
there
nothing
definite
to
tell
you
except
that
she
has
said
she
does
care
for
dick
burden
and
that
generally
speaking
if
appearances
are
against
her
i
must
kindly
not
judge
by
them
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
long
as
you
can
you
say
but
thank
heaven
i
can
do
more
i
give
her
the
benefit
of
not
doubting
at
all
except
in
those
black
moments
i
have
confessed
to
you
we
have
had
some
good
road
adventures
together
and
she
has
proved
herself
a
thorough
sportswoman
as
well
as
a
jewel
of
a
companion
but
of
course
i
have
had
her
often
to
myself
senter
and
dick
burden
are
still
of
the
party
and
say
nothing
about
future
plans
though
there
was
a
vague
understanding
when
they
first
came
that
they
were
asked
for
a
fortnight
they
seem
to
be
enjoying
themselves
so
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
pleased
and
senter
is
agreeable
to
everybody
though
sometimes
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
she
and
ellaline
do
hit
it
off
invariably
still
i
may
be
mistaken
she
praises
ellaline
and
seems
anxious
to
throw
her
into
dick
society
which
presumably
she
would
do
if
she
did
like
the
girl
dick
did
run
up
to
scotland
to
see
his
mother
for
a
few
days
and
i
thought
as
mrs
burden
sent
for
him
on
account
of
her
health
he
might
have
to
stay
on
but
no
such
luck
he
was
back
almost
indecently
soon
pounced
down
upon
us
at
bideford
just
in
time
perhaps
to
prevent
my
your
advice
before
i
got
the
fact
is
there
was
a
queer
misunderstanding
with
which
i
wo
bore
you
but
by
which
ellaline
was
left
behind
at
tintagel
and
i
went
back
alone
to
fetch
her
with
the
car
she
was
adorable
even
unusually
adorable
and
i
loved
her
horribly
yes
that
the
only
word
for
it
because
it
hurt
it
hurt
so
much
that
next
day
i
felt
i
could
go
on
bearing
the
pain
and
that
i
should
have
to
find
a
chance
to
tell
her
i
was
pretty
sure
she
would
think
me
a
and
several
other
kinds
of
a
fool
even
though
she
were
polite
in
words
nevertheless
i
might
have
run
the
risk
even
unspurred
by
your
letter
if
dick
had
come
back
looking
extremely
young
and
attractively
impertinent
she
care
a
rap
for
him
she
says
she
does
so
i
suppose
she
knows
her
own
mind
still
the
contrast
between
our
years
is
in
his
favour
and
with
him
under
my
nose
as
well
as
continuously
underfoot
i
see
myself
as
i
fear
others
see
me
yet
i
may
not
be
able
to
keep
my
head
if
a
chance
should
come
and
if
i
lose
it
my
head
i
mean
that
the
time
to
take
your
advice
we
have
been
seeing
some
fine
country
of
late
dunster
was
one
of
the
best
bits
also
grand
old
luttrell
castle
which
by
the
way
is
stancy
castle
in
the
laodicean
there
are
some
rare
old
buildings
in
dunster
which
reek
history
the
church
has
a
noble
rood
screen
and
the
yarn
market
is
unique
in
england
so
is
the
queer
old
nunnery
and
the
ancient
inn
where
we
stayed
illustration
yarn
market
is
unique
in
cleve
abbey
is
only
a
few
miles
away
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
magnificence
of
the
ruin
which
was
used
as
a
farmhouse
for
years
and
would
be
thus
degraded
still
if
it
were
for
luttrell
the
owner
of
dunster
castle
who
has
bought
and
restored
it
cistercian

as
old
as
the
tenth
century
with
a
gatehouse
of
richard

second

bits
of
exquisite
encaustic
tiling
from
the
demolished
church
preserved

enchant

and
archæologists
beautiful
and

century
i
think
and
some
shadowy
ghosts
of
frescoes
ellaline
was
enchanted
with
the
old
custodian
who
talked
much
about
heart
of
oak
and
when
she
ventured
to
remark
that
he
looked
as
if
he
were
made
of
it
she
and
the
old
fellow
himself
both
blushed
amusingly
we
came
on
through
pretty
williton
where
lived
reginald
fitz
urse
who
helped
murder
thomas
of
canterbury
and
where
everything
is
extraordinarily
ancient
except
the
motor
garage
by
this
we
were
among
the
quantock
hills
and
the
differences
between
devonshire
and
somerset
scenery
were
beginning
to
be
very
marked
difficult
to
define
such
differences
but
they
visible
in
every
feature
the
shape
of
the
downs
the
trees
standing
up
tall
and
isolated
in
zummerzet
like
landmarks
even
the
conformation
of
roads
which
by
the
way
are
extremely
good
in
these
regions
a
pleasant
change
for
the
car
after
some
of
her
wild
and
tobogganning
feats
in
north
devon
do
you
remember
how
when
we
were
boys
we
discussed
favourite
names
and
placed
audrey
high
in
the
list
among
those
of
women
here
in
the
quantock
hills
they
spell
it
audrie
for
the
saint
who
patronizes
west
quantoxhead
and
i
have
learned
that
it
was
the
name
which
the
outlawed
doone
tribe
best
loved
to
give
their
girl
children
i
think
i
used
to
say
i
should
like
to
marry
a
girl
named
audrey
but
never
heard
of
such
a
person
in
real
life
until
ellaline
informed
me
on
seeing
audrie
that
it
the
name
of
her
most
intimate
friend
i
responded
by
confessing
my
boyish
resolve
and
to
amuse
myself
asked
if
she
would
some
day
introduce
me
to
her
friend
not
for
the
world
said
she
and
blushed
i
wish
i
could
make
myself
believe
her
jealous
you
would
probably
encourage
me
to
think
it
wordsworth
loved
the
pleasant
region
of
the
quantock
hills
you
know
and
wrote
some
charming
poems
while
he
and
coleridge
lived
at
nether
stowey
and
alforden
but
just
to
see
in
passing
nether
stowey
looks
unattractive
and
as
for
bridgewater
not
much
farther
on
where
a
red
road
has
turned
pink
then
pale
then
white
with
chalk
it
is
as
commercial
to
look
at
as
it
is
historical
to
read
of
when
a
boy
in
bloodthirsty
moods
i
used
to
pore
over
that
history
read
how
judge
jeffreys
lodged
at
bridgewater
during
the
bloody
assizes
the
house
is
gone
now
washed
away
like
an
old
blood
stain
how
the
moor
between
weston
and
bridgewater
in
these
days
lined
with
motors
was
lined
with
feversham
gibbets
after
sedgemoor
does
macaulay
refer
to
that
as
the
last
fight
deserving
the
name
of
battle
fought
on
english
soil
then
there
was
the
story
of
swayne
jumps
which
one
connected
with
bridgewater
he
made
his
famous
escape
in
toxley
wood
close
by
and
to
this
day
the
place
is
marked
with
three
stones
that
sort
of
thing
rushes
you
back
in
a
minute
over
long
distances
in
time
does
it
as
motors
rush
you
forward
in
a
minute
over
long
distances
of
space
so
to
glastonbury
by
way
of
poland
hill
looking
down
over
the
sedgemoor
plain
chedzoy
church
on
whose
southern
buttress
the
battle
axes
were
sharpened
and
weston
zoyland
with
its
name
and
dykes
i
never
saw
glastonbury
until
now
and
i
not
sure
that
having
seen
it
i
sha
be
obliged
to
hook
it
on
top
of
winchester
on
my
bump
of
reverence
not
that
one
can
compare
its
ruined
grandeur
with
winchester
the
comparison
lies
in
the
oldness
and
the
early
beginnings
of
religion
i
believe
glastonbury
is
the
one
religious
institution
in
which
briton
saxon
and
norman
all
share
and
share
alike
so
the
place
seems
to
bind
our
race
to
a
race
supplanted
dunstan
is
the
great
man
of
the
place
because
he
it
was
who
restored
the
monastery
after
danish
wars
but
he
is
a
modern
celebrity
beside
joseph
of
arimathea
the
founder
who
came
with
eleven
companions
to
bring
the
holy
word
to
britain
it
was
the
archangel
gabriel
who
bade
him
found
a
church
in
honour
of
the
virgin
and
it
was
a
real
inspiration
of
the
archangel
for
what
one
can
see
of
the
chapel
of
joseph
is
absolutely
perfect
a
gem
of
beauty
we
came
to
glastonbury
in
the
afternoon
having
lunched
at
a
nice
old
coaching
house
in
bridgewater
and
after
pausing
for
a
look
at
the
abbot
kitchen
i
drove
straight
to
the
george
which
i
had
heard
of
as
being
the
pilgrim
inn
of
ancient
times
and
the
best
bit
of
domestic
architecture
in
the
town
the
idea
was
to
have
tea
there
an
indulgence
for
which
emily
clamoured
being
half
choked
with
chalky
dust
but
the
house
was
so
singularly
beautiful
and
interesting
that
it
seemed
a
crime
not
to
sleep
in
it
the
front
is
a
gorgeous
mass
of
carved
panelling
in
the
middle
rises
a
gateway
and
on
the
left
is
a
marvel
of
a
bow
window
with
a
bay
for
every
story
we
went
up
a
newel
stairway
to
look
at
rooms
and
one
in
which
henry
viii
slept
a
night
fell
to
my
share
not
because
i
was
selfishly
ready
to
take
the
best
however
for
there
were
several
others
more
curious
if
not
more
interesting
our
quarters
for
the
night
selected
we
went
out
on
foot
first
taking
the
abbey
and
chapel
of
the
blessed
virgin
corruptly
known
as
joseph
it
a
good
thing
pat
that
you
did
get
your
youthful
way
and
annex
emily
because
you
have
or
had
a
strong
weakness
for
ruins
and
she
does
appreciate
them
in
any
form
the
difference
between
her
expression
and
ellaline
while
gazing
at
what
is
left
of
glastonbury
glory
was
a
study
emily
bored
yet
conscientiously
desiring
to
be
interested
the
girl
rapt
radiant
and
indeed
these
remnants
of
beauty
are
pathetically
fair
enough
to
draw
tears
to
such
young
eyes
as
hers
they
are
even
more
majestic
in
ruin
than
they
could
have
been
in
noblest
prime
i
think
because
those
broken
arches
have
the
splendour
of
classic
tragedy
they
are
like
a
poem
of
which
a
few
immortal
lines
are
lost
in
the
warm
light
of
the
august
afternoon
the
old
stones
pillars
and
arches
of
glastonbury
abbey
seemed
to
be
carved
in
stained
ivory
a
bas
relief
on
lapis
lazuli
we
lingered
until
our
pretty
senter
got
the
look
in
her
eyes
of
one
who
has
stood
too
long
in
boots
and
emily
asked
plaintively
whether
we
were
not
going
to
see
the
glastonbury
thorn
it
appeared
that
she
had
promised
to
write
her
tame
parson
about
it
and
send
him
a
sprig
for
planting
and
she
was
much
disappointed
when
she
heard
that
the
original
thorn
joseph
of
blossoming
staff
had
been
destroyed
centuries
ago
on
hill
where
the
saintly
band
rested
on
the
way
to
glastonbury
one
trunk
of
the
famous
tree
was
hewed
down
by
a
puritan
in
elizabeth
day
happy
to
tell
you
he
lost
a
leg
and
an
eye
in
the
act
while
the
second
and
only
remaining
one
was
destroyed
by
a
military
saint
in
the
great
rebellion
what
disagreeable
things
saints
have
done
exclaimed
ellaline
which
shocked
emily
there
have
been
very
few
ones
anyhow
my
sister
returned
mildly
with
a
slightly
reproachful
glance
at
me
aimed
at
my
spiritual
failures
i
cheered
her
up
by
promising
that
i
would
get
her
a
sprig
of
thorn
at
wells
and
telling
her
how
all
the
transplanted
slips
have
the
habit
of
blossoming
on
christmas
day
old
style
january
is
it
our
next
sight
was
the
museum
in
the
market
place
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
pat
there
nothing
much
more
interesting
to
be
found
the
world
over
if
you
interested
in
antiquities
as
you
and
i
are
there
the
alfred
jewel
which
of
course
the
women
liked
best
and
next
in
their
estimation
came
the
bronze
mirrors
the
queer
pins
and
big
needles
the
rouge
pots
and
the
hair
curlers
which
emily
gravely
pronounced
to
be
curiously
like
hinde
of
the
celtic
beauties
who
lived
before
the
visits
of
those
clever
commercial
travellers
the
phoenicians
these
relics
were
taken
from
the
prehistoric
village
at
godnet
marsh
discovered
only
about
sixteen
years
ago
and
they
were
found
with
others
far
more
important
for
instance
a
big
clumsy
canoe
of
black
oak
which
was
soft
as
soap
when
it
first
came
up
out
of
its
in
the
thick
peat
bog
but
was
hardened
afterward
by
various
scientific
tricks
i
confess
to
more
interest
in
the
dice
boxes
and
dice
some
of
which
the
sly
old
celtic
foxes
had
loaded
cheating
is
precisely
a
modern
device
it
seems
after
the
museum
i
took
the
party
to
a
jeweller
i
heard
of
and
bought
some
copies
of
the
sacred
treasures
a
replica
of
the
alfred
jewel
a
silver
bowl
exactly
imitating
a
bronze
one
from
the
lake
village
probably
of
greek
manufacture
brought
over
by
phoenicians
and
other
quaint
and
interesting
things
ellaline
is
to
have
the
jewel
the
silver
bowl
is
to
be
a
sop
to
senter
and
for
emily
is
a
tiny
model
oven
such
as
the
phoenicians
taught
the
celts
to
make
and
cornish
cottagers
bake
their
bread
in
to
this
day
there
was
the
old
red
lion
inn
to
see
too
where
abbot
whiting
lay
the
night
before
his
execution
which
was
a
murder
and
the
almshouses
and
a
dozen
other
things
which
tourists
are
expected
to
see
besides
many
dozen
which
they
are
not
and
it
is
for
the
latter
that
ellaline
and
i
have
a
predilection
she
and
i
are
also
fond
of
believing
any
story
which
is
interesting
therefore
we
are
both
invaluable
victims
to
the
custodians
of
museums
and
other
show
places
the
nice
old
fellow
in
the
glastonbury
museum
was
delighted
with
our
faith
which
would
not
only
have
moved
mountains
but
transported
to
such
mountains
any
historic
celebrity
necessary
to
impress
the
picture
we
believed
in
the
burying
of
the
original
chalice
from
which
to
this
hour
flows
a
pure
spring
the
holy
or
blood
spring
we
believe
that
patrick
was
born
and
died
on
the
isle
of
avalon
and
more
firmly
than
all
that
both
arthur
and
guinevere
were
buried
under
mary
or
joseph
chapel
why
did
the
custodian
point
out
to
us
in
the
picture
of
an
ancient
plan
of
the
chapel
the
actual
spot
where
their
bodies
lay
what
could
we
ask
more
than
that
but
if
we
go
to
scotland
next
year
we
shall
doubtless
believe
just
as
firmly
that
arthur
rests
there
in
spite
of
the
record
at
glastonbury
in
spite
even
of
tennyson
the
island
valley
of
avilon
where
falls
not
hail
or
rain
or
any
snow
nor
ever
wind
blows
loudly
but
it
lies
happy
fair
with
and
bowery
hollows
crown
with
summer
sea
where
i
will
heal
me
of
my
grievous
wound
does
that
come
back
to
you
from
arthur
speech
to
bedévere
but
he
died
of
the
grievous
wound
after
all
and
the
custodian
goes
so
far
as
to
assert
solemnly
that
when
the
coffins
were
opened
in
the
days
of
henry
ii
the
bodies
of
the
king
and
queen
were
very
beautiful
to
see
for
a
moment
untouched
by
time
but
that
in
a
second
as
the
people
looked
their
dust
crumbled
away
all
except
the
splendid
golden
hair
of
guinevere
which
remained
to
tell
of
her
glory
for
many
a
long
year
until
it
was
stolen
and
disappeared
forever
that
is
a
good
story
anyhow
and
adds
to
the
curious
almost
magical
enchantment
of
glastonbury
ellaline
says
that
the
very
name
of
glastonbury
will
after
this
ring
in
her
ears
like
the
sound
of
fairy
bells
chiming
over
the
lost
lake
that
ringed
the
isle
of
avalon
you
know
i
dare
say
that
glastonbury
is
supposed
to
have
its
derivation
from
british
ynyswytryn
inis
vitrea
the
island
of
glass
because
the
water
surrounding
it
was
blue
and
clear
as
crystal
so
many
golden
apples
grew
in
the
island
orchards
that
it
became
also
the
isle
of
avalon
from
avalla
an
apple
even
now
the
queer
conical
isolated
hills
of
the
neighbourhood
are
called
islands
and
it
is
easy
to
picture
glastonbury
as
an
isle
rising
among
lesser
ones
out
of
a
bright
azure
estuary
stretching
away
and
away
to
the
bristol
channel
the
saxon
king
edgar
whose
royal
castle
has
given
the
name
to
the
town
of
edgarly
must
have
had
a
fine
view
in
his
day
and
now
you
have
only
to
go
up
tor
hill
a
landmark
for
miles
round
with
its
tower
of
michael
on
top
like
the
of
a
dead
king
to
see
wells
cathedral
to
the
north
the
blue
mendips
east
and
west
and
cutting
the
range
a
mysterious
break
like
a
door
which
means
the
wild
pass
of
cheddar
far
in
the
west
a
gleam
of
the
bristol
channel
south
the
polden
hills
the
dorset
heights
beyond
and
the
quantocks
overtopped
by
the
peak
of
dunkery
beacon
i
think
one
would
have
to
go
far
to
see
more
of
england
in
one
sweep
of
the
eye
indeed
foreigners
might
come
make
a
hasty
ascent
of
tor
hill
and
take
the
next
boat
back
to
their
own
country
telling
their
friends
not
untruthfully
that
they
had
seen
england
at
night
in
the
room
of
henry
i
dreamed
i
saw
anne
boleyn
with
ellaline
face
which
smiled
at
me
the
lips
saying
i
forgive
you
if
you
forgive
me
i
hope
that
a
good
omen
we
gave
ourselves
hours
in
glastonbury
and
the
neighbourhood
running
out
to
the
prehistoric
village
at
godney
marsh
to
see
the
excavations
and
to
meare
by
the
by
the
very
causeway
over
which
our
motor
spun
was
built
of
stones
from
the
abbey
then
on
toward
evening
to
wells
there
have
been
surprisingly
blue
evenings
lately
to
which
ellaline
has
drawn
my
attention
and
her
simile
on
the
way
to
wells
that
we
seemed
to
be
driving
through
a
pelting
rain
of
violets
i
thought
rather
pretty
what
shall
i
do
i
wonder
if
i
have
to
part
with
her
give
her
to
some
other
man
perhaps
it
hardly
bears
thinking
of
and
yet
it
may
easily
happen
it
seems
to
me
that
every
man
who
sees
her
must
want
her
and
the
feeling
does
make
for
peace
or
comfort
i
suppose
i
might
be
different
and
less
the
brute
if
i
lived
so
long
in
the
east
growing
used
to
eastern
customs
but
as
it
is
when
i
see
some
man
eyes
light
upon
her
face
and
rest
there
in
surprised
admiration
i
want
to
snatch
her
up
wrap
her
in
a
veil
and
run
off
with
her
in
my
arms
beastly
is
it
i
have
no
such
feeling
however
in
connection
with
senter
although
she
is
very
striking
and
excites
a
good
deal
of
attention
wherever
we
go
i
have
seen
emily
so
happy
since
we
have
been
motoring
as
she
is
at
wells
and
it
seems
almost
criminal
to
tear
her
away
though
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
do
so
she
says
that
except
at
home
she
has
never
felt
such
an
air
of
religious
calm
as
at
wells
and
something
in
the
feeling
which
i
can
understand
though
i
must
admit
i
do
go
about
the
world
searching
for
religious
calm
certainly
one
ca
imagine
a
crime
being
committed
at
wells
and
a
wicked
thought
would
be
rather
wickeder
here
than
elsewhere
not
that
the
cathedral
is
to
me
alluringly
beautiful
i
believe
it
ranks
high
and
is
even
exalted
as
the
best
secular
church
to
be
found
the
world
over
the
west
front
being
glorified
as
a
masterpiece
beyond
all
others
in
england
at
first
sight
it
vaguely
disappointed
me
i
am
no
expert
judge
of
architecture
and
do
pretend
to
be
still
i
dare
to
have
my
likes
and
dislikes
and
it
was
not
until
i
walked
round
the
cathedral
many
times
stood
and
stared
at
it
and
gone
up
heights
to
survey
it
from
different
points
of
view
that
i
began
to
warm
toward
it
mightily
now
i
find
it
eminently
noble
yet
not
so
lovable
as
some
which
my
memory
cherishes
some
not
perhaps
as
architecturally
or
artistically
perfect
but
you
know
what
individuality
buildings
have
especially
those
which
are
vast
and
dominating
and
wells
is
unique
as
the
common
people
say
it
wants
knowing
emily
usually
sparing
of
adjectives
pronounces
the
lady
chapel
a
dream
and
i
do
think
she
exaggerates
but
for
myself
the
things
least
forgettable
in
the
cathedral
will
be
the
chapter
house
stairs
and
the
beautiful
fourteenth
century
glass
the
ascent
of
the
staircase
is
an
exquisite
experience
and
as
ellaline
cried
out
in
her
joy
it
must
be
like
going
up
a
snow
mountain
by
moonlight
the
old
clock
in
the
transept
too
holds
one
hypnotized
waiting
always
to
see
what
will
happen
next
peter
lightfoot
the
glastonbury
monk
who
made
it
in
the
fourteenth
century
must
have
had
a
lively
imagination
and
have
loved
excitement
something
doing
as
americans
say
ellaline
and
i
are
overcome
with
sympathy
for
one
of
four
desperately
fighting
knights
who
never
gets
the
colours
hard
luck
to
work
like
that
for
hundreds
of
years
and
never
succeed
at
last
emily
has
seen
the
glastonbury
thorn
and
obtained
her
slip
as
an
exceptional
favour
she
longs
for
christmas
to
come
to
know
if
it
will
bloom
as
it
does
regularly
every
year
in
the
gardens
of
the
bishop
palace
until
now
i
could
have
imagined
envying
a
bishop
but
to
live
in
the
palace
at
wells
and
own
the
palace
gardens
for
life
would
be
worth
a
few
sacrifices
i
should
think
there
could
have
been
never
a
more
poetical
or
charming
garden
on
earth
not
excepting
eden
or
a
few
indian
gardens
i
have
admired
it
is
perfect
as
ellaline
says
even
pluperfect
in
its
contrast
with
the
gray
ruins
and
the
mellow
ancient
house
there
is
an
embattled
wall
which
makes
a
terrace
walk
above
the
fair
lawns
and
jewelled
flower
beds
and
from
the
top
as
you
walk
the
hills
girdling
the
old
city
go
waving
in
gradations
of
blue
to
an
opal
horizon
there
an
old
well
house
in
the
garden
which
is
one
of
its
chief
ornaments
and
has
adorned
it
since
the
fifteenth
century
bishop
beckington
the
beckington
of
the
punning
rebus
beacon
and
tun
built
it
to
supply
water
to
the
city
but
there
were
plenty
of
other
springs
always
seven
famous
ones
which
suggested
the
name
wells
and
had
they
not
existed
perhaps
king
ina
who
flourished
in
the
eighth
century
and
was
mixed
up
in
glastonbury
history
would
not
have
founded
a
cathedral
here
blessed
be
the
seven
wells
then
for
without
them
one
of
the
fairest
places
in
england
might
never
have
existed
i
had
heard
of
the
celebrated
swans
and
as
i
knew
she
would
like
them
i
determined
to
pay
the
birds
a
morning
call
the
day
after
we
arrived
with
ellaline
from
any
obtrusion
of
emily
i
felt
safe
for
her
mind
whirls
here
with
old
oak
carvings
flaxman
sculptures
ancient
vestments
carven
tombs
and
above
all
choral
services
indeed
emily
is
never
at
her
best
except
in
a
cathedral
and
i
knew
that
swans
would
not
be
ecclesiastic
enough
to
please
her
but
of
senter
and
dick
i
had
to
be
more
wary
for
the
lady
no
doubt
because
she
is
my
guest
feels
it
polite
to
give
me
a
good
deal
of
her
society
and
dick
naturally
considers
that
ellaline
time
is
wasted
on
me
especially
when
he
is
by
to
alleviate
the
boredom
my
one
chance
was
to
lure
the
girl
out
early
for
neither
senter
nor
burden
loves
the
first
morning
hours
with
all
the
guilty
tremors
of
one
who
cooks
an
intrigue
i
sent
a
note
to
ellaline
room
just
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
asking
if
she
were
sporting
enough
to
come
for
a
walk
at
i
thought
that
way
of
putting
the
invitation
would
fetch
her
and
it
did
but
perhaps
a
card
i
enclosed
had
something
to
do
with
her
prompt
acceptance
i
printed
in
my
best
imitation
of
engraved
text
and
swan
and
the
misses
cygnet
at
home
in
the
moat
bishop
palace
ring
for
refreshments
five
minutes
later
came
down
a
scrap
of
paper
all
she
had
no
doubt
with
a
little
pencil
scrawl
saying
that
miss
lethbridge
was
delighted
to
accept
and
swan
kind
invitation
for
and
thanked
sir
lionel
pendragon
for
obtaining
it
i
have
put
this
away
with
my
treasures
of
course
i
was
at
the
place
appointed
before
the
time
and
she
did
keep
me
waiting
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
always
extraordinarily
prompt
modern
school
training
i
suppose
as
ellaline
the
first
was
never
known
to
be
in
time
for
anything
and
the
swans
were
worth
getting
up
for
they
are
magnificent
creatures
but
unlike
many
professional
beauties
they
as
clever
as
they
are
handsome
for
generations
they
and
their
ancestors
have
been
trained
to
ring
a
bell
when
they
breakfast
and
to
see
the
whole
family
mother
babies
and
cousins
breasting
the
clear
lilied
water
and
waiting
in
a
dignified
not
too
eager
row
while
father
pulls
a
bell
in
the
old
palace
wall
tweaking
the
string
impatiently
with
his
beak
is
better
than
any
theatrical
performance
of
this
season
in
london
ellaline
was
entranced
and
would
have
the
play
played
over
and
over
again
by
the
swan
actors
and
the
stage
manageress
a
kindly
and
polite
woman
who
conducted
the
entertainment
when
we
were
both
ashamed
to
beg
for
more
ellaline
suggested
a
walk
round
the
town
which
is
of
an
unspoiled
beauty
and
you
can
guess
whether
or
no
i
was
glad
to
be
her
guide
i
certain
i
should
have
proposed
before
breakfast
i
wonder
if
any
other
man
was
ever
in
love
enough
for
that
if
dick
burden
and
his
aunt
had
turned
a
corner
at
the
critical
moment
but
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
in
spite
of
what
you
say
i
am
certain
she
would
have
refused
me
nevertheless
for
your
encouragement
my
dear
old
pat
i
am
yours
ever
gratefully
pen
xxvi
senter
to
her
sister
mrs
burden
hotel
without
end
amen
my
dear
sis
talk
about
a
land
where
it
is
always
afternoon
seems
to
me
it
will
never
stop
being
august
i
dead
sick
of
motoring
in
present
company
and
so
furious
with
sir
lionel
that
the
only
revenge
i
can
think
of
is
to
marry
him
would
that
i
could
say
vengeance
is
mine
but
it
still
a
bird
in
the
bush
i
regret
to
say
while
in
my
hand
is
nothing
save
the
salt
which
i
trying
to
sprinkle
on
its
tail
curious
feeling
one
has
on
a
motor
tour
i
have
the
sensation
of
being
detached
from
my
own
past
good
thing
that
for
ladies
of
our
acquaintance
like
a
hook
that
come
out
of
its
eye
the
hook
however
is
quite
ready
to
fit
into
any
new
eye
that
happens
to
be
handy
or
dig
out
any
eye
that
happens
to
be
in
the
way
and
that
brings
me
back
to
mademoiselle
lethbridge
it
really
ca
be
good
for
liver
to
dislike
anyone
as
much
as
i
have
grown
to
dislike
that
girl
but
unfortunately
i
ca
afford
to
despise
her
she
is
clever
almost
too
clever
for
cherished
protected
schoolgirl
nineteen
would
that
i
could
find
a
screw
loose
in
her
history
would
i
make
it
rattle
i
thought
i
had
got
hold
of
one
through
the
tyndals
but
sir
lionel
would
listen
to
the
rattling
would
let
it
rattle
for
an
instant
it
is
only
the
change
of
climate
and
english
food
that
prevents
his
manners
from
being
as
no
doubt
they
were
in
eastern
climes
those
of
a
bashaw
and
if
he
were
one
husband
he
could
be
more
disagreeable
than
he
is
at
times
not
that
he
means
to
be
disagreeable
if
he
did
one
would
know
how
to
take
him
or
not
to
take
him
but
it
is
his
polite
indifference
to
which
i
object
i
not
used
to
it
in
men
it
like
a
brick
wall
you
dying
to
kick
against
only
it
no
use
i
do
take
all
the
trouble
i
do
with
my
hair
and
complexion
not
to
be
looked
at
i
assure
you
why
my
waist
might
just
as
well
be
two
inches
bigger
for
all
he
notices
it
is
too
trying
and
then
to
see
the
way
he
looks
at
that
girl
who
know
enough
about
physical
economy
to
make
powder
stick
on
her
nose
when
it
rains
it
does
me
good
to
talk
to
you
like
this
dick
is
sympathetic
because
he
happens
to
be
in
love
with
the
young
female
and
though
he
occasionally
abuses
her
himself
on
the
spur
of
a
snub
he
wo
let
me
do
it
do
think
however
that
i
give
up
hope
by
no
means
i
have
heaps
of
tricks
up
my
sleeve
small
and
fashionable
as
it
is
and
lots
of
strings
to
my
bow
but
i
just
wish
one
was
a
bowstring
and
round
a
neck
i
give
a
tiny
tiny
pull
in
fact
i
give
one
yesterday
one
which
i
been
wanting
to
give
ever
since
i
received
your
letter
but
actually
till
yesterday
i
never
got
a
chance
i
made
several
but
they
always
went
to
bits
like
a
child
house
of
cards
poor
me
that
is
part
of
the
creature
cleverness
i
think
she
knew
by
instinct
that
i
had
something
nasty
to
say
and
she
kept
dodging
about
preventing
me
from
laying
hands
i
wo
say
claws
on
her
dick
too
she
has
kept
in
the
same
position
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
pounce
indeed
she
has
handled
us
both
surprisingly
well
considering
her
age
and
bringing
up
i
have
a
certain
respect
for
her
but
one
often
respects
people
one
dislikes
does
one
at
least
really
nice
amusing
people
of
my
type
do
exactly
what
dick
wants
to
do
with
his
white
mouse
when
he
has
pounced
on
it
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
for
since
a
slight
misunderstanding
not
to
say
row
which
we
had
on
the
night
of
his
return
from
scotland
and
you
a
certain
reserve
has
fallen
between
us
like
a
stage
curtain
he
is
on
the
stage
side
i
am
in
the
position
of
audience
but
i
was
never
in
doubt
for
a
moment
as
to
what
would
follow
pounce
provided
the
mouse
did
prove
too
strong
for
me
and
i
do
think
it
has
my
pretty
little
ladylike
bite
must
have
left
a
mark
on
the
velvet
fur
i
dare
say
i
have
excited
your
curiosity
by
referring
to
a
row
with
dick
and
lest
you
neglect
my
interests
in
the
rest
of
the
letter
to
brood
upon
his
i
better
pander
at
once
to
your
maternal
anxiety
he
would
have
confessed
to
me
anything
you
had
told
him
about
miss
lethbridge
antecedents
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
hangs
onto
her
with
the
grip
of
a
bulldog
on
a
but
as
i
was
armed
with
your
letter
i
found
it
waiting
for
me
at
bideford
containing
full
information
he
saw
it
was
no
use
to
keep
anything
back
if
i
had
had
the
letter
a
little
earlier
i
might
not
have
racked
my
valuable
brain
as
violently
as
i
did
to
give
him
a
chance
alone
with
ellaline
i
arranged
for
him
to
find
her
deserted
at
king
castle
like
mariana
in
her
moated
grange
but
on
reading
what
you
had
to
say
i
admit
i
had
qualms
as
to
the
wisdom
of
my
policy
where
future
was
concerned
however
even
then
i
trusted
to
myself
to
save
him
if
it
came
to
the
worst
and
it
might
have
been
valuable
for
my
future
if
things
had
happened
according
to
schedule
just
because
sir
lionel
such
a
bashaw
he
would
never
again
have
felt
the
same
to
the
girl
if
she
had
schemed
to
be
left
behind
in
order
to
meet
dick
however
i
can
control
most
men
and
many
women
but
i
ca
control
trains
and
it
was
through
their
missing
connections
that
dick
missed
rescuing
his
ladylove
as
it
has
turned
out
no
harm
has
been
done
to
him
i
wish
i
could
be
as
sure
of
myself
for
sir
lionel
i
fancy
has
been
quite
as
nice
since
he
ca
guess
what
i
had
to
do
with
the
affair
but
i
suppose
even
men
have
instinct
inferior
to
ours
though
it
be
dick
came
to
my
room
at
bideford
and
was
cross
because
things
had
gone
wrong
i
was
cross
because
he
was
cross
i
hate
injustice
in
anyone
but
myself
and
then
he
was
crosser
because
i
told
him
it
would
never
do
for
him
to
marry
the
girl
knowing
what
we
now
know
he
said
he
would
have
her
and
hang
everybody
else
especially
sir
lionel
i
argued
that
hanging
people
would
do
no
good
and
he
then
said
that
it
would
be
all
right
anyhow
about
the
as
he
knew
a
way
of
getting
something
decent
out
of
sir
lionel
for
her
what
he
knew
he
firmly
refused
to
divulge
and
when
i
asked
if
he
told
you
he
replied
that
he
jolly
well
had
also
he
accused
me
of
stinginess
in
not
wanting
pendragon
to
part
and
wishing
to
keep
the
whole
hog
for
myself
his
delicate
way
of
expressing
my
desire
to
retain
the
means
of
purchasing
tiaras
suitable
to
my
rank
in
case
i
should
become
the
future
lady
pendragon
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
our
family
relations
were
somewhat
strained
but
before
they
reached
snapping
point
with
my
accustomed
tact
partly
learned
from
you
i
smoothed
my
nephew
down
regardless
of
my
own
injured
feelings
nothing
could
be
better
for
me
than
that
he
should
be
engaged
to
miss
lethbridge
though
of
course
nothing
could
be
worse
for
us
all
than
that
he
should
marry
her
trust
me
i
say
again
as
i
have
said
before
to
prevent
that
i
assure
you
i
can
easily
do
it
meanwhile
i
encourage
dick
to
believe
that
he
has
softened
my
hard
heart
and
though
he
does
believe
in
me
absolutely
or
tell
me
all
the
workings
of
his
mind
i
certain
you
need
have
no
anxiety
about
your
son
and
heir
now
to
my
own
affairs
which
after
dick
future
and
your
neuralgia
i
flatter
myself
are
dear
to
you
you
often
remarked
that
i
nothing
if
not
dramatic
and
perhaps
when
i
tell
you
what
i
did
yesterday
you
will
think
i
proved
it
for
the
hundredth
or
is
it
the
thousandth
time
we
left
wells
which
depressed
me
as
all
cathedral
towns
do
because
everybody
and
even
every
building
seems
so
unco
guid
to
run
through
the
cheddar
ravine
which
i
fancy
though
i
do
know
and
care
less
is
among
the
mendip
hills
i
woke
up
with
a
headache
not
having
slept
on
account
of
a
million
church
clocks
and
bells
which
were
deadly
busy
all
night
and
i
felt
i
should
be
no
better
until
i
had
it
out
with
the
enemy
sir
lionel
as
you
know
can
be
a
pleasant
companion
when
he
chooses
and
he
so
in
his
soldier
way
that
i
ca
help
admiring
him
when
i
not
hating
him
but
it
is
a
strain
on
the
nerves
headache
or
no
headache
sitting
next
a
man
and
trying
every
minute
to
make
him
like
you
better
than
he
does
the
woman
he
wants
to
be
with
who
is
sitting
behind
him
it
means
that
you
must
be
amusing
and
witty
and
interested
in
everything
he
says
but
how
can
you
be
witty
when
the
only
thing
you
want
to
say
is
devil
and
damn
of
which
he
would
violently
disapprove
from
a
lady
lips
or
pen
and
how
can
you
be
interested
in
all
he
says
when
he
discourses
about
mouldy
old
saints
and
legends
and
history
and
things
over
and
done
with
long
ago
like
that
what
do
i
care
if
dunstan
of
whom
i
heard
too
much
at
glastonbury
saved
king
edmund
hunting
in
the
mendips
from
falling
over
cheddar
cliff
horse
and
man
why
i
do
even
know
who
edmund
was
or
when
he
happened
celtic
relics
found
in
caves
are
less
than
nothing
to
me
and
roman
coins
are
a
mere
aggravation
when
one
is
bothered
how
to
get
current
coin
of
the
realm
botany
bores
me
too
though
i
have
been
studying
it
together
with
many
other
dull
things
which
unfortunately
for
me
sir
lionel
likes
well
we
went
up
the
mendip
hills
by
way
of
an
obscure
little
village
called
priddy
which
seemed
important
to
sir
because
they
found
some
lead
pigs
in
a
mine
there
marked
imp
vespasianus
and
a
few
old
roman
dice
and
brooches
like
it
would
be
much
more
to
the
point
if
he
would
take
an
interest
in
what
wear
rather
than
concentrating
his
attention
on
the
way
roman
miners
or
soldiers
contrived
to
fasten
their
rags
together
it
would
console
one
for
invariably
losing
one
pins
and
hatpins
when
one
wants
them
most
if
one
could
think
future
generations
would
grow
emotional
over
them
yet
on
the
whole
i
should
prefer
it
done
by
a
certain
man
in
my
own
generation
the
moment
we
got
away
from
priddy
where
a
lot
of
starfish
roads
come
together
my
spirits
rose
the
country
began
to
look
theatrical
which
was
a
pleasant
change
after
wells
and
all
my
native
dramaticness
began
to
surge
in
me
i
felt
on
my
mettle
and
when
sir
lionel
talked
about
visiting
the
cheddar
caverns
i
said
to
myself
my
name
is
gwen
senter
if
i
do
get
hold
of
the
girl
in
a
cave
and
tell
her
a
thing
or
two
it
ca
be
easy
to
escape
from
people
in
caves
i
thought
and
so
it
proved
but
i
have
come
to
that
yet
i
really
enjoyed
the
cheddar
ravine
it
is
the
sort
of
scenery
that
appeals
to
me
hills
rose
wild
and
rocky
shutting
in
our
road
and
brigands
would
have
been
appropriate
as
in
some
mountain
pass
of
spain
there
were
sheer
gray
cliffs
like
castles
and
churches
and
said
sir
lionel
here
we
come
straight
from
one
of
the
finest
cathedrals
made
by
man
to
see
what
nature
can
do
in
the
way
of
ecclesiastical
architecture
façades
here
as
fine
as
any
west
front
and
vaguely
rich
with
decoration
i
purred
of
course
agreeing
and
pointing
out
graceful
spires
empty
niches
for
saints
tombs
for
cardinals
and
statues
of
kings
and
bishops
with
crowned
and
mitred
heads
babbling
on
thus
with
hurried
intelligence
lest
ellaline
should
jump
in
ahead
it
the
kind
of
place
this
weird
alley
of
colourful
rock
where
you
feel
things
must
happen
and
i
determined
they
happen
a
hidden
place
you
are
surprised
at
being
able
to
enter
as
if
the
door
had
been
shut
by
enchantment
a
few
million
years
and
then
forcibly
opened
for
modern
motorists
i
used
this
idea
on
sir
lionel
in
a
form
too
elaborate
to
waste
on
a
sister
and
made
a
distinct
hit
but
ellaline
got
in
a
little
deadly
work
at
the
first
cave
she
began
talking
fairy
talk
with
sir
lionel
and
that
not
being
my
style
i
had
to
let
her
have
her
head
fancy
pretending
to
be
a
child
who
having
lost
itself
suddenly
sees
a
hole
in
a
rock
crawls
in
for
shelter
from
beasts
of
the
forest
and
finds
that
by
accident
it
has
stumbled
on
the
entrance
to
fairyland
but
miss
lethbridge
had
quite
a
fairy
game
with
sir
lionel
who
she
played
was
his
ancestor
king
arthur
carried
to
this
strange
place
by
the
four
queens
who
rowed
his
body
across
the
lake
you
can
be
one
of
the
queens
if
you
like
she
graciously
said
to
me
and
dear
norton
another
i
suggested
that
turned
the
budding
drama
into
farce
as
i
meant
it
should
it
was
a
weird
cave
and
would
have
served
excellently
for
my
purpose
but
when
i
heard
there
was
another
to
follow
as
servants
say
of
the
next
course
for
dinner
i
thought
it
would
be
an
to
use
this
one
besides
there
were
a
good
many
people
in
it
there
were
tricky
illuminations
to
show
off
the
best
formations
one
of
which
was
king
solomon
temple
king
sitting
with
folded
arms
at
the
entrance
his
knees
up
as
if
he
had
a
pain
but
being
only
a
pink
stalagmite
he
could
be
expected
to
behave
having
done
justice
to
gough
cavern
we
returned
to
the
car
and
skimmed
along
the
splendid
road
to
the
next
cave
which
it
appears
is
a
deadly
rival
of
the
first
one
advertises
visits
of
martel
the
explorer
the
other
boasts
the
approval
of
royalty
i
sure
they
would
love
to
have
a
notice
up
by
appointment
to
the
king
as
if
they
were
tailors
but
what
could
a
king
do
with
a
cave
nowadays
at
one
time
it
might
have
been
handy
to
hide
in
but
those
days
and
those
kings
are
changed
i
believe
by
the
way
britons
did
hide
in
one
or
two
of
the
cheddar
caverns
when
the
saxons
were
uncomfortably
interested
in
their
whereabouts
and
there
are
bones
but
i
glad
to
say
we
see
them
i
hate
to
be
reminded
of
what
i
built
on
and
ca
bear
to
look
in
the
glass
after
seeing
a
skull
with
or
without
in
this
second
cave
when
norton
was
putting
an
appropriate
prehistoric
question
i
coached
her
up
to
ask
her
brother
i
linked
a
friendly
arm
in
ellaline
and
bore
her
off
under
convoy
what
a
sweet
illuminated
stalactite
curtain
said
i
rapturously
does
it
look
like
translucent
coral
and
would
you
like
to
have
a
dress
exactly
that
colour
thus
i
managed
to
keep
her
with
me
and
fall
behind
the
others
glaring
at
dick
so
meaningly
as
to
frighten
him
away
when
he
showed
signs
of
lingering
my
scene
thus
effectively
set
and
the
two
leading
characters
on
the
stage
together
i
lost
no
time
in
beginning
to
recite
my
lines
it
was
in
a
dark
sort
of
with
some
kind
of
an
illuminated
witches
kitchen
or
devil
cauldron
to
look
at
and
give
us
an
excuse
to
pause
all
very
effective
miss
lethbridge
i
said
i
have
rather
a
disagreeable
duty
to
perform
when
people
tell
you
they
have
a
duty
to
perform
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
disagreeable
she
replied
with
a
flippancy
on
which
i
consider
i
have
the
patent
have
i
a
black
on
my
nose
or
is
my
dress
undone
at
the
back
there
is
a
black
said
i
but
it
not
on
your
nose
on
my
character
perhaps
she
insinuated
not
exactly
said
i
but
it
will
be
on
my
conscience
if
i
do
get
it
off
you
see
you
ought
to
know
if
you
do
know
handicapped
and
it
is
fair
that
a
girl
like
you
should
be
handicapped
i
been
trying
for
days
to
screw
up
my
courage
to
speak
in
this
queer
place
i
feel
suddenly
as
if
i
could
shall
we
talk
here
while
we
have
the
chance
you
talk
please
said
she
i
will
do
the
rest
pert
thing
however
i
took
her
at
her
word
and
did
what
i
had
to
do
with
neatness
and
dispatch
as
an
executioner
should
but
the
odd
part
was
that
when
i
had
chopped
off
her
head
with
the
axe
you
sharpened
for
me
and
posted
from
scotland
registered
and
expressed
she
hardly
seemed
to
know
it
was
off
she
did
look
a
little
pale
though
that
might
have
been
the
effect
of
the
strange
light
but
she
thanked
me
pleasantly
for
telling
her
the
truth
and
said
she
quite
appreciated
my
motive
i
was
prompted
entirely
by
my
interest
in
you
and
because
of
my
nephew
friendship
i
said
oh
yes
said
she
in
a
voice
like
cream
what
else
it
be
it
could
be
nothing
else
i
replied
emphatically
i
sure
i
hated
distressing
you
but
it
was
that
good
might
come
i
do
hope
it
upset
you
too
much
no
not
too
much
said
she
but
it
has
made
me
horribly
hungry
really
that
did
stagger
me
i
must
confess
i
ca
tell
what
to
make
of
the
girl
anyhow
she
which
is
the
principal
thing
and
no
matter
how
remarkable
an
actress
she
may
be
for
her
age
she
must
care
it
would
be
human
not
to
care
for
such
a
story
about
her
own
mother
and
father
yet
she
took
it
so
impersonally
i
ca
get
over
that
and
she
actually
ate
a
good
luncheon
i
wonder
she
could
swallow
but
of
course
i
put
everything
as
politely
as
i
could
put
such
things
because
i
did
want
her
to
scream
or
faint
well
i
need
have
worried
we
had
lunch
at
an
inn
near
cox
cavern
with
two
cascades
in
the
back
garden
which
is
shut
in
by
quite
a
private
and
special
gorge
of
its
own
i
watched
the
girl
as
much
as
i
dared
but
she
looked
about
as
usual
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
the
only
noticeable
effect
of
our
conversation
was
that
she
seemed
somewhat
suppressed
sat
silent
and
thoughtful
and
attempted
no
sallies
dozens
of
motors
arrived
while
we
were
eating
gorgeous
cars
with
resplendent
chauffeurs
but
there
was
one
to
put
the
bonnet
of
apollo
as
someone
has
named
ours
out
of
joint
and
not
one
chauffeur
as
striking
as
our
extraordinary
bengali
in
his
native
dress
i
forgot
to
mention
that
i
bound
ellaline
to
secrecy
before
i
began
my
tale
saying
that
i
had
the
information
in
confidence
she
has
her
faults
but
i
do
think
she
break
her
word
she
is
one
of
those
tall
upstanding
creatures
who
pride
themselves
on
keeping
a
promise
till
it
mouldy
my
headache
was
better
after
relieving
my
mind
and
i
enjoyed
the
run
to
clifton
and
bristol
we
had
to
go
through
the
queer
old
gray
village
of
cheddar
which
was
as
cheesy
looking
as
one
would
expect
it
to
be
and
i
suppose
the
market
cross
we
passed
must
have
been
good
as
sir
lionel
would
stop
and
take
a
photograph
as
we
turned
out
of
the
place
for
axbridge
i
threw
a
glance
over
my
shoulder
back
at
the
exit
of
the
queer
valley
and
a
carved
bronze
screen
seemed
already
to
have
been
drawn
across
it
it
was
a
fine
road
axbridge
a
sort
of
toy
village
whose
houses
might
have
been
made
for
good
little
girls
to
play
with
and
to
avoid
the
traffic
in
the
main
road
we
went
by
way
of
congresbury
where
the
live
i
was
glad
we
did
meet
them
driving
their
old
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
bow
there
was
a
turn
which
led
us
into
a
charming
road
winding
high
among
woods
then
coming
out
where
the
gorge
of
the
avon
burst
upon
our
view
it
always
pleases
sir
lionel
if
one
is
enthusiastic
over
scenery
so
i
was
though
i
really
hated
going
over
that
awfully
high
suspension
bridge
as
i
detest
looking
down
from
heights
so
does
norton
but
i
ca
afford
to
be
classed
with
her
therefore
i
joined
ellaline
in
exclaiming
that
the
bridge
was
glorious
i
suppose
it
is
fine
if
one
could
only
look
without
fear
of
being
seasick
we
stopped
all
night
in
clifton
in
which
miss
lethbridge
was
interested
largely
because
of
evelina
who
stopped
at
the
hot
wells
in
the
most
romantic
part
of
the
story
i
could
for
my
life
remember
who
wrote
evelina
which
was
awkward
and
it
has
come
back
to
me
yet
i
always
mix
the
book
up
with
clarissa
harlowe
and
so
does
dick
though
of
course
he
read
neither
we
went
to
see
a
lot
of
things
in
bristol
but
the
best
was
a
church
called
mary
redcliffe
norton
though
tired
pined
to
go
when
she
heard
it
was
famous
and
it
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
to
deny
her
a
church
if
she
wants
one
the
others
except
dick
said
it
was
worth
stopping
for
also
that
they
were
glad
they
did
so
somebody
was
pleased
and
sir
and
jabbered
enough
history
in
bristol
to
last
a
schoolmaster
a
week
i
was
quite
thankful
to
start
again
and
stop
the
flow
of
intelligence
because
i
had
found
time
to
fag
up
bristol
and
clifton
beforehand
as
i
do
some
towns
so
we
came
to
bath
where
we
been
stopping
for
two
days
at
one
of
the
best
hotels
in
england
and
where
i
might
enjoy
a
little
civilization
if
it
were
that
there
are
a
thousand
and
one
old
houses
and
other
features
which
mademoiselle
ellaline
pretends
she
yearns
to
visit
of
course
know
that
all
she
wants
is
a
chance
to
monopolize
sir
society
but
does
know
that
and
my
business
is
not
only
to
fight
unjust
monopoly
but
to
establish
a
trust
myself
consequently
there
is
no
rest
for
the
wicked
and
i
too
gloat
over
relics
of
the
past
luckily
for
me
as
i
have
had
to
do
more
here
than
almost
anywhere
else
bath
is
a
fascinating
place
and
i
believe
it
becoming
very
fashionable
again
anyhow
all
the
great
ones
of
earth
seem
to
have
lived
here
at
one
time
or
another
i
wonder
if
it
might
be
nice
for
you
to
spend
a
season
taking
the
waters
or
bathing
or
whatever
is
the
smartest
thing
to
do
i
noticed
it
only
the
very
smartest
thing
that
ever
thoroughly
agrees
with
you
and
i
sympathize
i
have
the
sort
of
feeling
that
what
is
good
for
duchesses
may
be
good
for
me
but
if
i
bring
off
what
i
aiming
at
now
lady
pendragon
shall
rise
on
the
ladder
of
her
husband
fame
and
her
own
charm
to
the
plane
of
royalties
by
the
way
in
nosing
about
among
the
foundations
of
a
church
here
peter
they
found
the
wife
her
body
i
mean
of
that
king
edmund
thingummy
i
never
could
find
out
about
he
seems
always
to
be
cropping
up
i
was
in
hopes
we
only
have
to
go
back
to
the
roman
days
of
bath
as
that
saves
trouble
but
oh
no
down
i
must
dip
into
saxon
lore
or
not
in
it
with
the
industrious
miss
lethbridge
i
think
the
wretched
saxons
had
a
mint
here
or
something
and
there
were
religious
pageants
of
great
splendour
in
which
that
everlasting
dunstan
mixed
himself
up
i
tell
you
these
things
i
may
explain
not
because
i
think
you
will
be
interested
but
because
i
want
to
fix
them
in
my
mind
as
we
finished
doing
bath
yet
and
are
to
stop
another
day
or
two
as
for
roman
talk
there
is
no
end
of
it
among
us
it
mingles
with
our
meals
which
would
otherwise
be
delicious
and
in
my
dreams
instead
of
being
lulled
by
the
music
of
a
beautiful
weir
under
my
window
i
find
myself
mumbling
yes
sir
lionel
ptolemy
should
have
said
the
place
was
outside
not
in
the
belgic
border
sounds
like
something
new
in
embroidery
does
it
strange
indeed
that
they
only
discovered
the
roman
baths
so
late
as
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
then
only
think
of
finding
the
biggest
and
best
of
all
more
than
a
hundred
years
later
i
assure
you
i
have
kept
my
end
up
with
my
two
companions
and
i
was
even
able
to
tell
sir
lionel
a
legend
he
know
about
bladud
a
son
of
the
british
king
lud
hudibras
creating
bath
by
black
magic
secreting
a
miraculous
stone
in
the
spring
which
heated
the
water
and
cured
the
sick
then
bladud
grew
so
conceited
about
his
own
powers
that
he
tried
to
fly
and
if
he
had
succeeded
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
wright
brothers
to
bother
but
when
he
got
as
far
as
london
from
bath
the
broke
and
he
fell
plop
on
a
particularly
hard
temple
of
apollo
after
him
reigned
his
son
no
less
a
person
than
king
lear
i
got
this
out
of
a
queer
little
old
book
i
bought
the
first
day
we
came
but
i
assumed
the
air
of
having
known
it
since
childhood
there
another
legend
it
seems
about
bladud
and
a
swine
but
it
less
esoteric
than
this
and
sir
lionel
likes
mine
better
i
do
wish
we
had
to
spend
so
much
time
poking
about
in
the
roman
baths
for
though
there
are
good
enough
sights
to
see
there
for
those
who
love
that
sort
of
thing
one
does
get
such
cold
feet
and
there
are
such
a
lot
of
steps
up
and
down
one
dress
is
soon
dusty
round
the
bottom
and
that
a
bore
when
one
has
no
maid
if
i
could
choose
i
prefer
the
pump
room
and
would
rather
talk
of
beau
nash
and
the
old
assembly
rooms
than
of
minerva
and
her
temple
or
indeed
of
pepys
or
miss
austen
and
fanny
burney
by
the
way
evelina
was
hers
i
found
that
out
without
committing
myself
i
wish
i
could
buy
the
book
for
sixpence
i
think
i
try
when
nobody
is
looking
and
it
ought
to
be
easy
for
we
simply
haunt
a
bookshop
in
gay
street
belonging
to
a
meehan
who
is
a
celebrity
here
he
has
written
a
book
in
which
sir
lionel
is
much
interested
called
famous
houses
of
bath
and
as
it
seems
he
knows
more
about
the
place
as
it
was
in
old
days
and
as
it
is
now
than
any
other
living
person
he
has
been
going
round
with
us
showing
us
those
features
i
mentioned
he
appears
to
have
architecture
of
all
kinds
at
his
finger
tips
and
not
only
points
out
here
and
there
what
wood
the
elder
and
wood
the
younger
did
under
patronage
of
ralph
allen
but
knows
which
architect
work
was
good
which
bad
which
indifferent
and
that
really
is
beyond
me
i
suppose
one
ca
have
a
soul
for
paris
fashions
and
english
architecture
too
i
prefer
to
be
a
judge
of
the
former
thanks
it
of
much
more
use
in
life
i
should
think
there
can
hardly
be
a
street
court
or
even
alley
of
old
bath
into
which
we
have
been
led
by
our
clever
cicerone
to
see
a
bit
which
ought
on
any
account
to
be
missed
here
the
remains
of
the
roman
wall
crowded
in
among
mere
things
there
the
place
where
queen
elizabeth
stayed
or
queen
anne
where
catherine
morland
lodged
or
general
tilney
where
miss
elliot
and
captain
wentworth
met
where
john
hales
was
born
and
terry
the
actor
where
sir
sidney
smith
and
de
quincey
went
to
school
the
house
whence
elizabeth
linley
eloped
with
sheridan
the
place
where
the
king
of
bath
poor
old
nash
died
poor
and
neglected
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
all
the
way
to
prior
park
where
pope
stayed
with
ralph
allen
rancorously
reviling
the
town
and
its
air
so
now
you
can
imagine
that
my
walking
and
standing
muscles
are
becoming
abnormally
developed
to
the
detriment
of
the
ones
which
i
fear
may
be
atrophied
or
something
before
we
return
to
motor
life
sir
lionel
has
remarked
that
bath
is
a
microcosm
of
england
and
i
hastened
to
say
yes
it
is
do
you
happen
to
know
what
a
microcosm
means
dick
says
it
a
conglomeration
of
microbes
but
he
is
always
wrong
about
abstract
things
unconnected
with
sherlock
holmes
by
this
time
you
will
be
as
tired
of
bath
as
if
you
had
pottered
about
in
it
as
much
as
i
have
and
wo
care
whether
it
had
two
great
periods
roman
and
eighteenth
century
or
twenty
inextricably
entangled
with
the
south
pole
and
kamchatka
tired
than
i
even
for
i
have
got
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
to
the
eye
from
the
agreeable
terraces
and
crescents
and
the
pure
white
stone
buildings
that
glitter
on
the
hillsides
overlooking
the
avon
that
is
the
sort
of
background
which
is
becoming
to
me
and
as
i
had
all
my
luggage
meet
me
in
bath
i
have
been
able
to
dress
for
it
whereas
miss
lethbridge
has
done
most
of
her
exploring
in
blue
serge
in
a
day
or
two
we
are
off
again
wales
sooner
or
later
i
believe
though
i
ask
no
questions
as
i
do
care
to
draw
attention
to
my
own
future
plans
we
were
asked
for
a
fortnight
and
i
am
not
troubling
my
memory
to
count
by
how
many
days
we
have
overstayed
not
our
welcome
i
hope
but
our
invitation
you
will
wonder
perhaps
why
i
overstay
since
i
frankly
admit
that
i
fed
up
with
too
much
scenery
and
too
much
information
yet
no
you
are
far
too
clever
to
wonder
dear
sis
you
will
see
for
yourself
that
i
must
go
on
like
the
brook
until
sir
lionel
asks
me
to
go
on
as
lady
pendragon
or
else
until
i
have
to
abandon
hope
but
i
wo
think
of
that
and
i
am
being
so
nice
to
norton
whenever
necessary
that
i
think
she
has
forgiven
me
the
colour
of
my
hair
and
will
advise
her
brother
to
invite
me
to
make
a
little
visit
at
graylees
castle
where
it
is
understood
the
tour
eventually
comes
to
an
end
when
this
end
may
arrive
the
god
of
automobiles
knows
a
chauffeur
proposes
the
disposes
and
the
never
reposes
when
there
another
woman
and
a
man
in
the
case
gwen
that
was
an
inspiration
of
mine
about
the
cheddar
cavern
it
i
have
another
now
and
will
make
a
note
of
it
get
sir
to
take
me
to
see
the
ruins
of
tintern
abbey
by
moonlight
if
any
and
while
there
induce
him
to
propose
or
think
he
has
done
so
i
have
a
white
dress
which
would
just
suit
xxvii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
dearest
saint
we
not
exactly
living
in
tintern
abbey
that
would
be
too
good
to
be
true
and
would
also
annoy
the
rooks
which
cry
and
cry
always
in
the
ruins
as
if
they
were
ghosts
of
the
dead
cistercian
monks
clothed
not
in
white
but
in
decent
black
ever
mourning
their
lost
glory
but
we
are
in
a
perfect
duck
of
a
hotel
covered
with
virginia
creeper
and
as
close
by
as
can
be
we
arrived
this
afternoon
and
have
had
an
hour
or
two
of
delightful
dawdling
in
the
abbey
soon
we
are
to
have
an
early
dinner
which
we
shall
bolt
if
necessary
so
that
we
may
go
in
again
by
moonlight
before
the
moon
escapes
i
have
dressed
quickly
because
i
wanted
to
begin
a
letter
to
you
i
sha
have
time
to
finish
it
but
i
do
that
when
we
come
back
from
the
heavenly
ruins
with
moonlight
in
my
pores
and
romance
in
my
soul
i
ought
to
write
a
better
letter
in
such
a
mood
ought
i
and
i
do
try
to
write
nice
letters
to
my
angel
because
she
says
such
dear
kind
things
about
them
and
also
because
i
love
her
better
every
day
we
seen
quantities
of
beautiful
things
and
places
since
i
wrote
you
last
darling
to
think
them
over
is
like
drawing
a
long
gold
chain
strewn
at
intervals
with
different
precious
stones
through
the
fingers
slowly
jewel
by
jewel
the
gold
chain
is
our
road
and
the
beautiful
beads
are
the
places
of
course
i
can
say
draw
them
slowly
through
the
fingers
because
we
do
scorch
we
are
out
to
see
the
fair
face
of
england
not
to
scurry
over
it
like
distracted
flies
i
do
remember
many
jewels
on
the
way
to
gloucester
from
bath
through
cold
aston
and
stroud
but
if
i
were
properly
up
in
history
no
doubt
i
should
have
noted
more
than
i
did
yet
gloucester
itself
was
a
diamond
of
the
first
water
i
feared
to
be
disappointed
in
the
cathedral
so
soon
after
exquisite
wells
and
the
abbey
at
bath
which
i
loved
but
as
soon
as
i
got
inside
it
was
quite
otherwise
especially
as
i
had
sir
lionel
to
show
me
things
and
he
knew
gloucester
of
old
to
me
the
interior
was
almost
as
interesting
as
winchester
itself
which
so
far
has
outranked
all
for
the
transition
from
one
period
to
another
is
so
clearly
and
strangely
marked
and
it
the
actual
birthplace
of
perpendicular
architecture
the
cloisters
must
be
among
the
loveliest
in
the
world
and
there
a
great
jewelled
window
which
leaves
a
gorgeous
scintillating
circle
in
my
mind
eye
just
as
the
sun
does
on
your
body
eye
when
you
have
looked
in
the
face
of
its
glory
oh
and
the
extraordinary
stone
veil
with
its
gilded
ornamentation
i
sha
forget
that
but
shall
think
of
it
when
i
am
old
there
is
an
effect
as
of
tall
rows
of
ripe
wheat
bending
toward
one
another
gleaming
as
wheat
does
when
the
breeze
blows
and
the
sun
shines
we
heard
the
choir
singing
an
unseen
choir
of
boys
and
men
and
the
voices
were
like
shafts
of
crystal
rising
rising
rising
up
as
far
as
heaven
for
all
i
know
do
you
feel
that
the
voice
of
a
boy
is
purer
more
impersonal
and
sexless
somehow
than
the
clearest
soprano
of
a
woman
therefore
exactly
fulfilling
our
idea
of
an
angel
singing
think
of
gloucester
having
been
laid
out
on
the
same
plan
as
the
prætorian
camp
at
rome
they
proved
it
by
a
sketch
map
of
viollet
le
duc
and
under
the
city
of
the
saxons
and
mediæval
gloucester
lies
gloucestra
fair
city
of
the
romans
you
can
dig
bits
of
its
walls
and
temples
up
almost
anywhere
if
you
go
deep
enough
people
say
it
must
have
been
an
exciting
place
to
live
in
when
rome
ruled
britain
because
the
fierce
tribes
from
southern
wales
just
across
the
severn
were
always
spoiling
for
a
fight
but
now
one
ca
imagine
being
excited
to
any
evil
passion
in
this
shrine
of
the
great
abbey
of
the
severn
lands
the
one
passion
i
dared
feel
was
admiration
admiration
everywhere
all
the
way
through
from
the
tomb
of
osric
the
woden
who
founded
the
abbey
to
the
new
inn
which
is
very
old
and
perfectly
beautiful
in
the
ancient
streets
at
the
abbot
gateway
all
round
the
cathedral
inside
and
out
pausing
at
the
tombs
especially
that
of
poor
murdered
king
edward
who
was
killed
at
berkeley
castle
only
a
few
miles
away
and
so
on
and
on
even
into
the
modern
town
which
is
inextricably
tangled
with
the
old
there
are
quantities
of
interesting
and
lovely
places
according
to
sir
lionel
where
one
ought
to
go
from
gloucester
especially
with
a
motor
which
makes
seeing
things
easier
than
not
seeing
them
cheltenham
with
a
run
which
gives
glorious
views
over
the
severn
valley
and
stonebench
where
you
can
best
see
the
foaming
severn
bore
and
tewkesbury
which
you
be
interested
to
know
is
the
nortonbury
of
an
old
book
you
love
john
halifax
gentleman
and
malvern
and
there
even
not
too
far
away
for
a
day
run
but
sir
lionel
has
news
that
the
workmen
will
be
out
of
graylees
castle
before
long
and
he
says
we
must
leave
some
of
the
best
things
for
another
time
oxford
and
cambridge
for
instance
and
graylees
is
so
near
warwick
and
kenilworth
and
that
it
will
be
best
to
save
them
for
separate
short
trips
after
we
have
settled
down
at
home
how
little
he
guesses
that
there
be
no
settling
down
for
me
that
already
i
have
been
with
him
longer
than
i
expected
whenever
he
speaks
of
getting
home
and
what
we
will
do
after
that
it
gives
me
a
horrid
choky
feeling
and
i
afraid
he
thinks
me
unresponsive
on
the
subject
of
the
beautiful
old
place
which
he
apparently
longs
to
have
me
see
because
my
throat
is
always
too
shut
up
when
it
is
mentioned
to
talk
about
it
i
ca
do
much
more
than
say
yes
and
no
in
the
absolutely
necessary
places
and
generally
show
symptoms
of
cold
in
the
head
if
there
a
hanky
handy
of
course
i
am
dying
to
see
you
dearest
you
know
that
without
my
telling
and
you
are
everything
to
me
my
whole
world
yet
it
hurts
me
dreadfully
to
know
that
when
sir
lionel
pendragon
is
at
home
instead
of
carrying
out
the
nice
plans
he
makes
each
day
for
us
in
the
future
he
will
be
despising
me
heartily
and
thinking
me
the
very
worst
girl
without
exception
who
ever
lived
i
believe
he
now
dislikes
bloody
queen
mary
more
than
any
other
woman
who
ever
spoiled
the
earth
with
her
offensive
presence
but
probably
she
will
go
up
one
when
he
gets
to
know
about
me
i
do
doubt
that
he
be
angry
with
the
real
ellaline
as
well
but
not
absolutely
disgusted
with
her
as
he
will
be
with
me
besides
whatever
he
feels
it
wo
matter
to
her
very
much
except
where
money
is
concerned
because
she
will
be
married
before
he
knows
the
truth
she
wo
have
to
live
in
his
house
or
even
in
the
same
country
with
him
for
her
home
will
be
in
france
with
her
unfortunately
i
afraid
his
opinion
of
her
may
matter
in
a
mercenary
way
for
i
have
heard
the
whole
story
i
believe
the
story
of
ellaline
mother
and
father
as
connected
with
sir
lionel
past
senter
told
it
and
enjoyed
telling
it
because
she
thought
it
would
depress
and
take
the
spirit
out
of
me
she
hoped
i
sure
that
it
would
make
me
shrink
from
sir
lionel
society
in
shame
and
mortification
also
she
very
likely
fancied
that
i
might
consider
myself
an
unfit
bride
for
her
nephew
whose
attentions
to
me
are
extremely
convenient
for
her
but
she
would
prefer
not
to
have
them
end
in
matrimony
if
i
were
ellaline
lethbridge
with
the
feelings
of
audrie
brendon
i
should
have
taken
the
recital
precisely
as
she
expected
though
really
i
do
think
ellaline
herself
as
she
is
would
have
minded
desperately
except
about
the
money
but
being
audrie
brendon
and
not
ellaline
i
could
have
shouted
for
joy
at
almost
every
word
that
woman
said
if
it
had
been
in
a
cave
where
shouting
would
have
made
awful
echoes
you
know
dear
how
i
have
been
puzzling
over
sir
lionel
the
noble
as
he
appears
to
me
and
sir
lionel
the
dragon
as
painted
by
ellaline
and
how
i
vainly
tried
to
match
the
pieces
together
well
thanks
to
senter
revelations
the
puzzle
no
longer
exists
of
course
long
ago
i
made
up
my
mind
that
there
was
a
mistake
somewhere
and
that
it
on
my
side
still
i
could
understand
certain
things
now
there
one
which
i
ca
understand
very
well
and
that
why
i
so
ready
to
believe
senter
story
to
be
true
most
disagreeable
things
are
and
this
is
certainly
as
disagreeable
for
poor
little
ellaline
as
it
was
meant
to
be
disagreeable
for
me
senter
excused
herself
for
telling
me
horrid
tales
about
my
people
by
saying
that
my
ignorance
gave
me
the
air
of
being
ungrateful
to
sir
lionel
and
unappreciative
of
all
he
had
done
for
me
that
he
being
a
man
was
likely
to
blame
me
for
extravagance
and
indifference
to
benefits
received
although
aware
when
he
actually
reflected
on
the
subject
that
i
sinned
through
ignorance
she
thought
said
she
that
it
would
be
only
fair
to
tell
me
the
whole
truth
as
i
could
then
change
my
line
of
conduct
accordingly
but
she
hoped
i
would
give
her
away
to
sir
lionel
or
dick
as
she
was
speaking
for
my
sake
when
i
had
promised
she
informed
me
that
my
mother
ellaline
de
nesville
a
distant
cousin
of
lionel
pendragon
was
engaged
to
him
when
they
were
both
very
young
there
was
a
lawsuit
going
on
at
the
time
about
some
tin
mines
in
cornwall
from
which
most
of
his
money
came
for
the
property
was
claimed
by
a
man
from
another
branch
of
the
family
who
suddenly
appeared
waving
a
marriage
certificate
or
a
will
or
something
melodramatic
well
the
lawsuit
was
decided
for
the
other
man
just
about
the
time
that
sir
lionel
who
was
sir
lionel
then
got
shot
in
the
arm
and
seemed
likely
to
be
a
cripple
for
life
both
blows
coming
together
were
too
much
for
mademoiselle
de
nesville
who
was
fascinating
and
pretty
but
apparently
a
frightful
little
cat
as
well
as
flirt
so
she
promptly
bolted
with
an
intimate
friend
of
her
fiancé
a
frederic
lethbridge
rich
and
well
connected
they
ran
off
and
were
married
in
scotland
as
ellaline
the
second
expects
to
be
odd
how
even
profane
history
repeats
itself
and
this
though
lethbridge
knew
his
friend
was
desperately
in
love
with
the
girl
what
happened
immediately
after
i
do
know
except
that
senter
says
sir
lionel
was
horribly
cut
up
and
lost
his
interest
in
life
but
anyhow
sooner
or
later
the
lawsuit
which
had
gone
to
a
higher
court
was
after
all
decided
in
his
favour
the
other
man
turned
out
to
be
a
fraud
and
retired
into
oblivion
with
his
wills
and
marriage
certificates
meanwhile
ellaline
number
one
awoke
to
the
fact
that
her
husband
was
as
rich
as
he
was
painted
or
as
nice
as
she
had
fancied
some
of
his
people
were
millionaires
but
he
had
run
through
a
good
deal
of
his
fortune
because
he
was
mad
about
gambling
at
first
when
the
bride
supposed
that
there
was
heaps
of
money
she
enjoyed
gambling
too
and
they
were
always
at
longchamps
or
chantilly
or
the
english
or
at
aix
or
monte
carlo
by
and
by
though
when
she
found
that
they
were
being
ruined
she
tried
to
pull
her
husband
up
but
it
was
too
late
or
else
he
was
the
sort
of
person
who
ca
be
stopped
when
he
begun
running
down
hill
probably
she
regretted
her
cousin
by
that
time
as
he
was
rich
again
and
likely
to
be
richer
as
well
as
very
distinguished
and
when
a
few
years
later
while
our
ellaline
was
a
baby
frederic
lethbridge
forged
a
millionaire
uncle
name
and
had
to
go
to
prison
she
must
have
regretted
sir
lionel
still
more
for
she
was
a
little
creature
who
loved
pleasure
and
hardly
knew
how
to
bear
trouble
senter
said
that
lethbridge
had
been
sure
the
uncle
would
shield
him
rather
than
have
a
scandal
in
the
family
and
so
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
him
to
be
treated
like
an
ordinary
criminal
when
he
was
sentenced
to
several
years
in
prison
after
a
sensational
trial
he
contrived
to
hang
himself
and
was
found
in
his
cell
his
widow
had
to
go
and
live
with
some
dull
disagreeable
relations
in
the
country
who
thought
it
their
duty
to
take
her
and
the
baby
for
a
consideration
and
there
she
died
of
disappointment
and
galloping
consumption
leaving
a
letter
for
her
jilted
cousin
lionel
in
bengal
which
begged
him
to
act
as
guardian
for
her
child
all
the
money
she
had
at
her
death
was
a
few
thousand
pounds
of
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
touch
anything
but
the
income
about
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
that
sum
senter
gave
me
to
understand
constituted
my
sole
right
to
consider
myself
an
heiress
despite
the
shameful
way
in
which
she
had
behaved
to
him
sir
lionel
accepted
the
charge
eventually
took
his
cousin
little
girl
away
from
the
disagreeable
relatives
and
put
her
at
madame
de
maluet
where
mother
ellaline
was
educated
and
particularly
desired
her
daughter
to
be
educated
not
only
did
he
pay
for
her
keep
at
one
of
the
most
expensive
schools
in
france
madame
is
that
and
she
prides
herself
on
the
fact
but
gave
her
an
allowance
far
too
large
for
a
schoolgirl
in
the
opinion
of
senter
unknown
to
me
informant
does
this
account
for
everything
that
looked
strange
and
for
all
that
appeared
almost
cruel
in
sir
lionel
to
ellaline
who
had
heard
the
wrong
side
of
the
story
certainly
from
madame
de
blanchemain
a
silly
woman
i
fancy
and
perhaps
even
from
madame
de
maluet
whose
favourite
pupil
ellaline
the
first
was
no
wonder
sir
lionel
did
write
to
the
child
or
want
her
to
write
to
him
or
send
her
photograph
or
anything
and
no
wonder
he
dreaded
having
her
society
thrust
on
him
when
madame
de
maluet
hinted
that
it
was
hardly
decent
to
keep
his
ward
at
school
any
longer
i
even
understand
now
why
when
i
show
the
slightest
sign
of
flirtatiousness
or
skittishness
he
stiffens
up
and
draws
into
his
shell
i
very
politely
let
senter
see
that
i
appreciated
her
true
disinterestedness
in
repeating
to
me
this
tragic
family
history
and
of
course
she
was
a
cat
twice
over
to
do
it
at
the
same
time
i
never
liked
her
so
much
in
my
life
because
it
was
so
splendid
to
have
sir
lionel
not
only
justified
he
hardly
needed
that
with
me
at
this
stage
but
haloed
i
think
he
has
behaved
like
a
saint
on
a
window
do
you
i
have
interrupted
my
letter
about
places
and
things
tremendously
to
tell
you
the
story
as
it
was
told
to
me
but
it
seemed
to
come
in
appropriately
and
i
wanted
you
to
know
it
so
that
you
might
begin
to
appreciate
sir
lionel
at
his
true
worth
in
case
you
have
been
doubting
him
a
little
up
to
now
everyone
has
gone
down
to
dinner
i
afraid
and
i
must
go
too
because
of
the
abbey
afterward
and
not
keeping
them
waiting
but
perhaps
if
i
skip
soup
and
fish
i
may
stop
long
enough
to
add
that
after
gloucester
we
went
to
quaint
old
ross
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
man
of
ross
who
was
so
revered
that
a
most
lovely
view
over
the
river
wye
has
been
named
for
him
we
had
lunch
there
at
a
hotel
where
i
should
love
to
stay
and
then
passed
on
along
a
perfect
road
down
the
wye
till
we
came
to
kerne
bridge
near
goodrich
castle
there
we
got
out
leaving
buddha
as
the
god
in
the
car
and
walked
for
half
a
mile
along
a
romantic
path
to
the
ruined
castle
it
was
one
of
the
first
built
in
england
and
there
are
early
norman
parts
of
it
still
intact
and
incredibly
strong
looking
as
if
they
meant
to
last
another
thousand
years
i
was
so
interested
in
it
and
wish
whoever
it
may
concern
would
leave
the
castle
to
me
in
his
will
i
would
fix
up
a
room
or
two
and
bring
you
there
and
we
have
that
exquisite
view
always
under
our
eyes
as
for
servants
we
could
employ
ghosts
the
wye
is
even
more
charming
as
a
river
and
as
a
valley
than
we
used
to
imagine
when
we
wanted
to
do
england
before
it
burst
upon
us
that
most
of
the
wherewithal
was
used
up
nothing
could
be
more
dreamy
and
daintily
pretty
than
landscape
and
waterscape
though
here
and
there
is
a
bit
which
might
be
gray
and
grim
if
the
beetling
rocks
were
hatted
with
moss
and
mantled
with
delicate
green
trees
wherever
there
is
a
boulder
in
the
river
the
bright
water
laughs
and
plays
round
it
as
if
forbidding
it
to
look
stern
the
real
way
to
see
the
wye
is
by
motor
but
by
boat
i
am
sure
even
though
that
may
sound
treacherous
to
apollo
and
disloyal
to
my
petrol
but
we
did
the
best
we
could
and
went
out
of
our
way
some
miles
to
see
symond
yat
a
queer
delightful
white
village
on
a
part
of
the
river
which
is
particularly
divine
there
a
splendid
rock
and
the
yat
is
the
rock
as
well
as
the
village
also
there
a
cave
but
i
sorry
not
to
stop
and
go
in
lest
senter
might
seize
the
opportunity
of
telling
me
some
other
fearsome
tale
less
welcome
than
the
last
in
old
days
it
used
to
take
a
week
by
coach
from
london
to
monmouth
now
with
a
motor
i
dare
say
we
could
do
it
in
one
long
long
day
if
we
tried
only
it
would
be
silly
to
try
because
one
would
see
anything
and
would
make
oneself
a
nuisance
as
a
road
hog
to
everybody
one
met
or
passed
it
was
monmouth
we
came
to
next
after
digressing
to
symond
yat
and
as
it
was
nearly
evening
by
that
time
sir
lionel
decided
to
stay
the
night
he
meant
to
start
again
in
the
morning
but
monmouth
castle
towering
out
of
the
river
was
so
fine
that
it
was
a
pity
to
leave
it
unvisited
particularly
as
henry
a
special
hero
of
sir
lionel
mine
too
was
born
there
then
we
took
an
unplanned
run
to
raglan
castle
a
magnificently
impressive
ruin
and
that
is
why
we
arrived
so
late
at
tintern
this
letter
has
grown
like
jack
beanstalk
until
i
think
i
better
post
it
on
my
way
to
dinner
instead
of
adding
rhapsodies
about
moonlight
in
the
abbey
i
wo
forget
to
put
them
in
though
next
time
i
write
which
will
be
almost
immediately
if
not
sooner
your
even
more
loving
than
loquacious
audrie
xxviii
senter
to
her
sister
mrs
burden
my
dear
sis
he
came
the
moon
saw
and
i
did
conquer
you
know
what
i
mean
i
sure
you
remember
what
i
hoped
to
do
at
tintern
abbey
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
if
you
are
the
good
elder
sister
i
think
you
are
i
trust
you
prayed
for
my
success
if
you
did
do
mind
too
much
about
the
prayer
not
being
answered
but
try
again
and
give
sir
lionel
absent
treatments
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
because
if
the
moon
had
been
properly
turned
on
he
might
have
been
brought
to
the
point
for
i
look
my
best
by
moonlight
and
have
a
great
gift
of
pathos
in
a
white
light
like
heroines
of
melodrama
who
always
have
themselves
followed
about
by
it
on
purpose
or
else
by
a
patch
of
snow
but
the
moon
was
only
on
at
and
did
work
well
and
after
we
had
stubbed
our
toes
on
several
things
in
dark
shadows
among
the
ruins
i
just
folded
up
my
plan
of
campaign
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
until
next
time
the
pity
of
it
when
i
had
been
at
a
lot
of
trouble
to
persuade
norton
that
it
would
be
damp
in
the
abbey
and
that
there
exists
a
special
kind
of
bat
which
haunts
ruins
and
is
consumed
by
an
invincible
desire
to
nest
in
the
front
hair
so
she
stopped
in
the
hotel
and
as
for
miss
lethbridge
i
knew
i
could
trust
dick
to
look
after
her
but
well
it
ca
be
helped
and
the
moon
is
growing
bigger
and
brighter
every
night
i
do
know
whether
there
were
any
incidents
in
the
ranks
of
the
but
something
must
have
happened
for
mademoiselle
has
come
home
looking
i
dying
to
hear
what
the
matter
but
dick
wo
tell
perhaps
she
swallowed
a
bat
yours
would
that
i
could
say
sir
ever
lovingly
gwen
xxix
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
after
all
i
writing
again
darling
mother
i
do
think
that
dick
is
an
unmitigated
cad
i
told
him
so
and
he
said
it
was
only
because
i
was
so
unkind
to
him
and
he
was
determined
i
should
chuck
him
he
is
hateful
it
too
horrid
to
be
obliged
to
obey
dick
burden
orders
just
for
ellaline
sake
when
if
it
were
for
her
i
could
not
only
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
but
have
him
sent
away
in
disgrace
sir
lionel
would
thrash
him
i
believe
if
he
knew
but
it
useless
to
talk
about
that
and
as
dick
gracefully
reminds
me
the
pot
ca
call
the
kettle
black
i
am
the
pot
oh
i
was
in
such
a
happy
mood
when
we
went
into
the
abbey
and
so
delighted
that
we
were
able
to
be
there
by
moonlight
dreaming
as
little
of
what
would
happen
as
red
riding
hood
did
before
she
met
the
wolf
sir
lionel
and
i
started
together
somehow
but
the
minute
we
were
in
the
ruins
senter
called
him
to
ask
a
question
about
the
tombs
that
break
the
soft
green
carpet
of
grass
in
the
long
aisles
instantly
dick
pounced
on
me
just
as
his
aunt
did
in
the
cave
the
other
day
and
i
could
only
have
got
away
from
him
by
showing
that
i
rather
be
with
sir
lionel
which
of
course
i
would
do
dick
began
at
once
accusing
me
of
avoiding
him
and
keeping
out
of
his
way
on
purpose
when
he
tried
to
speak
with
me
alone
ever
since
he
came
back
from
scotland
and
i
retorted
flippantly
oh
have
you
only
noticed
that
since
then
but
in
a
minute
i
wished
i
had
defied
him
he
said
if
i
wanted
him
to
be
considerate
making
him
angry
was
the
right
way
to
set
about
it
and
that
if
i
had
been
in
his
power
before
i
was
a
good
deal
deeper
in
now
still
i
was
so
very
frightened
because
i
used
to
his
threats
and
i
thought
he
was
only
bluffing
so
i
bluffed
back
and
laughed
saying
that
it
did
suit
his
style
to
be
melodramatic
you
make
me
want
to
shake
you
he
said
crossly
i
know
that
said
i
and
then
he
burst
like
a
at
least
his
news
did
the
news
he
had
been
wanting
to
tell
me
since
bideford
when
he
was
in
scotland
saw
she
had
arrived
with
those
mcnamarras
i
told
you
about
and
their
place
must
be
near
the
one
where
dick
mother
is
visiting
he
recognized
her
from
that
photograph
of
the
school
where
he
saw
my
picture
too
you
know
and
was
able
to
find
out
my
name
and
where
we
live
in
versailles
that
is
he
thought
he
could
be
mistaken
but
made
sure
by
inquiring
until
he
hit
upon
someone
who
could
tell
him
that
a
mademoiselle
de
nesville
had
come
to
stay
with
and
miss
mcnamarra
of
course
he
could
have
known
that
ellaline
had
taken
the
name
of
de
nesville
but
as
he
had
heard
that
de
nesville
was
her
mother
maiden
name
it
was
difficult
for
a
budding
sherlock
holmes
to
put
two
and
two
together
you
see
how
much
worse
the
position
is
now
both
for
ellaline
and
me
and
that
the
little
wretch
did
exaggerate
when
he
boasted
that
more
in
his
power
than
ever
what
a
misfortune
that
ellaline
should
have
come
to
scotland
so
near
where
we
shall
be
too
if
we
go
to
the
roman
wall
he
has
only
to
tell
the
whole
thing
to
sir
lionel
and
say
if
you
do
believe
it
run
up
to
such
and
such
a
place
and
there
you
will
see
the
real
ellaline
lethbridge
whom
perhaps
you
may
recognize
from
her
likeness
to
your
cousin
her
dead
french
mother
if
only
ellaline
were
safely
married
but
she
ca
be
yet
for
days
and
days
i
afraid
she
was
to
have
written
or
telegraphed
me
at
gloucester
if
there
were
any
chance
of
her
soldier
lover
getting
away
sooner
than
last
expected
but
i
had
no
word
from
her
at
all
at
the
poste
restante
there
all
that
sounds
bad
enough
for
me
does
it
but
there
worse
to
come
the
wretch
swears
he
will
as
he
calls
it
give
the
show
away
to
sir
lionel
if
i
do
tell
sir
myself
that
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
dick
i
said
that
sir
lionel
would
believe
me
if
i
did
because
i
told
him
at
torquay
i
was
in
love
with
dick
that
admission
slipped
out
and
sherlock
holmes
caught
at
it
ah
i
thought
you
done
something
to
put
him
off
the
scent
he
flashed
out
i
call
that
downright
treacherous
of
you
and
all
the
more
i
hold
you
down
to
your
bargain
this
time
i
said
i
speak
unless
you
did
what
i
told
you
to
do
but
now
i
say
i
speak
this
minute
if
you
do
promise
by
all
that
sacred
to
ask
him
for
his
consent
i
shout
to
him
now
one
two
three
yes
yes
i
will
i
cried
because
dick
had
worked
himself
up
to
such
a
fury
that
i
saw
that
he
meant
what
he
said
i
shall
know
fast
enough
whether
you
keep
your
word
or
not
he
growled
and
if
you
do
you
understand
just
what
you
have
to
expect
if
i
had
given
in
to
ellaline
i
ought
to
have
known
that
nothing
but
trouble
could
come
of
it
yet
no
i
wo
wish
it
undone
i
ca
no
matter
what
happens
i
shall
never
really
regret
what
gave
me
the
chance
of
meeting
a
man
like
sir
lionel
i
do
think
there
is
another
in
the
world
and
i
am
to
have
the
honour
of
informing
him
that
in
love
with
that
little
worm
dick
burden
having
seen
the
sun
i
love
a
flicker
of
phosphorus
on
a
sulphur
match
do
write
me
the
minute
you
get
this
wo
you
no
telegraph
if
you
can
think
of
anything
consoling
to
say
poste
restante
chester
your
frightened
and
loving
audrie
xxx
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
brightest
and
best
i
have
a
short
reprieve
because
dick
has
had
to
go
away
again
not
to
his
mother
this
time
but
to
london
a
telegram
was
forwarded
to
him
from
gloucester
where
he
had
left
instructions
and
he
knocked
at
my
door
early
yesterday
morning
at
tintern
to
say
he
must
leave
immediately
by
the
first
train
he
was
excited
because
the
telegram
came
from
the
head
of
a
firm
of
private
detectives
with
whom
he
had
been
in
correspondence
for
some
time
trying
to
buy
a
junior
partnership
for
a
few
hundreds
left
him
by
his
grandmother
there
a
chance
now
that
he
may
get
the
partnership
only
he
must
be
on
the
spot
as
another
man
is
making
an
offer
more
advantageous
in
some
ways
dick
is
wild
to
get
in
and
regards
this
as
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
does
that
prove
the
type
of
mind
he
has
actually
yearning
to
be
in
business
as
a
detective
well
he
had
good
practice
lately
and
i
must
say
he
has
made
the
most
of
it
this
call
could
have
come
at
a
worse
time
but
i
must
obey
it
he
pronounced
solemnly
while
i
peeped
through
my
door
in
my
prettiest
ellaline
far
too
nice
to
waste
on
dick
disgusted
with
life
as
i
was
i
nearly
laughed
in
his
face
and
his
face
but
dared
not
quite
for
fear
of
enraging
him
again
just
when
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
comparatively
lenient
mood
he
had
come
to
explain
and
apologize
and
in
his
perky
conceit
really
seemed
to
fancy
that
i
might
be
hurt
at
his
desertion
so
when
he
asked
if
i
would
bid
him
pleasantly
and
remember
to
keep
my
promise
i
had
a
small
inspiration
i
would
bid
him
pleasantly
i
bargained
provided
he
let
me
off
keeping
the
promise
until
he
should
come
back
because
i
said
it
would
be
humiliating
to
plead
with
sir
lionel
on
the
very
day
my
turned
his
back
upon
me
in
order
to
attend
to
mere
business
you
call
this
business
sputtered
dick
and
i
soothed
him
but
persisted
firmly
gently
until
at
last
he
agreed
to
grant
the
reprieve
i
think
his
own
vanity
not
my
eloquence
obtained
the
concession
because
it
pleased
him
to
believe
that
i
leaned
upon
him
in
this
crisis
and
of
course
i
had
to
promise
over
again
more
earnestly
than
ever
not
to
back
out
but
to
stick
to
my
word
i
must
still
stick
to
it
of
course
unless
a
wire
or
letter
from
you
meanwhile
suggests
some
miraculous
agreeable
honourable
alternative
but
sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
and
the
dick
thereof
this
day
and
several
days
to
come
are
free
from
both
for
my
albatross
ca
arrange
the
details
of
its
partnership
sell
out
some
investments
in
order
to
pay
the
money
down
and
join
us
again
before
chester
there
i
shall
certainly
hear
from
you
and
i
have
such
infinite
faith
in
your
serpentineness
that
i
let
myself
cling
to
the
ragged
edge
of
hope
meanwhile
i
shall
enjoy
myself
as
much
as
i
possibly
can
so
that
at
worst
i
shall
have
more
good
days
to
remember
when
bad
days
come
for
the
days
will
be
very
bad
indeed
if
i
have
to
bear
sir
lionel
silent
scorn
and
still
remain
with
him
awaiting
release
from
ellaline
i
felt
like
a
different
human
being
after
dick
had
gone
and
would
have
written
you
at
once
but
he
had
delayed
me
so
long
that
i
had
to
finish
dressing
at
top
speed
because
we
were
to
make
an
earlier
start
than
usual
there
was
chepstow
castle
to
see
quite
near
and
a
shame
to
have
missed
it
as
well
as
a
run
to
tenby
chepstow
was
splendidly
picturesque
and
striking
but
the
country
through
which
we
had
to
pass
on
the
way
to
tenby
would
not
have
been
particularly
interesting
if
it
were
for
the
legends
and
history
with
which
it
is
as
full
as
it
is
of
ruined
castles
it
is
largely
coal
country
now
and
after
the
lovely
winding
wye
playing
with
its
guardian
hills
we
might
have
found
the
road
unattractive
as
we
ran
through
newport
cardiff
neath
swansea
and
carmarthen
but
it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
know
that
carmarthen
was
merlin
birthplace
that
stories
of
arthur
exploits
and
knightly
deeds
leave
golden
landmarks
everywhere
and
that
it
seems
quite
an
ordinary
reasonable
thing
to
the
people
to
name
railway
engines
after
sir
lancelot
is
it
charming
of
them
yet
what
would
elaine
the
lily
maid
of
astolat
say
to
such
a
liberty
i
wonder
we
arrived
in
tenby
too
late
for
anything
save
an
impression
last
evening
but
it
was
one
of
those
enchanting
mysterious
impressions
which
one
can
only
have
after
dusk
when
each
old
ivied
wall
is
purple
with
romance
and
each
lamp
in
a
high
window
is
a
lovelight
my
first
thought
as
we
came
in
and
found
tenby
on
fire
with
sunset
was
that
the
place
looked
like
a
foreign
town
set
down
in
england
and
so
of
course
it
is
for
it
was
founded
by
a
band
of
flemish
people
who
fled
from
persecution
the
huge
old
city
walls
and
quaint
gates
put
me
in
mind
of
a
glorified
boulogne
or
a
bit
of
old
dinan
under
the
castle
and
the
way
the
town
lies
with
its
beautiful
harbour
far
below
its
gray
rocks
and
broken
walls
by
the
sea
in
golden
sands
is
like
turner
ideas
of
historic
french
fortresses
the
benedictine
monks
too
who
come
across
the
gleaming
stretch
of
water
from
caldy
island
in
a
steam
yacht
add
one
more
foreign
note
and
delighted
to
tell
you
that
the
hotel
where
we
stayed
is
built
upon
the
city
wall
of
which
nobody
seems
to
know
the
date
not
even
the
the
people
we
asked
rather
apologized
for
having
to
confess
that
probably
it
was
no
earlier
than
the
twelfth
century
for
the
twelfth
century
is
considered
crudely
modern
for
welsh
things
in
front
of
my
bedroom
window
an
old
lookout
tower
darkly
veined
with
ivy
stood
up
from
the
vast
foundation
of
the
stone
wall
and
at
night
i
could
gaze
down
down
over
what
seemed
in
the
to
be
a
mile
of
depth
to
an
almost
tropical
garden
laid
out
on
the
wall
itself
when
the
tide
comes
in
and
drowns
the
gold
of
the
sands
the
sea
breaks
against
the
buttress
of
rock
and
stone
and
the
hotel
seems
all
surrounded
with
the
wash
and
foam
of
waters
like
a
fortified
castle
of
we
ought
to
have
stopped
more
than
one
night
and
part
of
a
next
day
but
there
is
so
much
so
much
to
do
and
as
i
told
you
sir
thoughts
are
already
marching
on
toward
home
there
are
all
the
beauty
spots
of
wales
before
us
and
the
lake
country
and
the
north
by
the
roman
wall
before
we
turn
south
again
for
graylees
i
say
we
but
you
know
what
i
mean
the
run
we
had
coming
through
cardigan
to
aberystwith
has
begun
to
show
me
what
wales
can
do
in
the
way
of
beauty
when
she
really
puts
her
soul
to
it
but
sir
lionel
says
it
is
nothing
to
what
we
shall
see
what
joy
that
i
have
still
a
and
a
day
after
empty
of
dick
do
you
suppose
a
condemned
person
finds
his
last
sip
of
life
the
sweetest
in
the
cup
i
can
imagine
it
might
be
so
you
be
glad
to
get
this
i
sure
dearest
so
i
send
it
at
once
with
loads
and
loads
of
love
from
your
criminal
child
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
aberystwith
is
nearly
as
beautiful
as
tenby
but
it
has
a
castle
towering
over
the
sea
built
by
no
one
less
than
gilbert
strongbow
the
cruel
who
grabbed
all
cardiganshire
for
himself
and
dotted
castles
about
everywhere
or
else
stole
other
people
which
saved
trouble
i
know
you
like
to
picture
me
wherever
i
am
so
i
must
tell
you
at
least
that
about
aberystwith
though
describing
places
seems
irrelevant
in
my
present
mood
i
am
keyed
to
the
top
notch
and
do
feel
able
to
do
anything
leisurely
i
do
not
expect
to
sleep
and
shall
get
up
as
soon
as
it
light
and
dart
down
to
the
beach
to
look
for
amber
or
carnelian
or
onyx
which
they
say
can
be
found
here
i
asked
a
chambermaid
of
the
hotel
after
we
arrived
this
evening
what
all
the
mysterious
stooping
people
were
doing
on
the
sands
and
she
said
searching
for
amber
to
bring
them
luck
i
hope
i
may
come
across
a
bit
even
a
tiny
bit
i
am
needing
a
there
was
another
mystery
which
puzzled
me
here
droves
of
pretty
girls
between
twelve
and
twenty
flitting
past
the
windows
on
the
front
every
few
minutes
sometimes
two
by
two
sometimes
four
or
five
together
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
so
many
young
girls
there
were
enough
for
the
girl
population
of
a
large
city
yet
here
they
were
all
crowded
together
in
this
small
but
the
chambermaid
has
swept
away
the
mystery
it
a
college
and
the
girls
live
out
in
different
houses
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
is
another
college
for
young
men
that
sounds
entertaining
does
it
xxxi
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
dear
i
did
find
the
amber
but
sir
lionel
found
a
fat
little
round
lump
and
gave
it
to
me
and
that
seems
almost
more
lucky
than
finding
it
myself
because
it
may
mean
that
something
good
is
to
come
to
me
from
him
he
was
on
the
aberystwith
beach
when
i
got
there
though
it
was
only
six
he
had
said
a
word
the
night
before
but
he
made
up
his
mind
then
to
find
some
amber
for
me
you
see
he
knew
the
superstition
about
luck
and
how
everybody
goes
hunting
for
it
i
picked
up
a
pretty
piece
of
carnelian
and
gave
it
to
him
in
exchange
asking
him
to
keep
it
to
remember
me
by
i
do
want
to
remember
you
he
answered
and
when
perhaps
i
looked
hurt
he
went
on
because
i
want
to
keep
you
in
my
life
i
want
you
very
much
if
but
just
then
senter
came
behind
us
and
left
that
if
like
a
key
sticking
in
a
door
which
could
be
opened
without
one
more
turn
i
should
have
liked
to
know
what
was
behind
the
door
but
i
daresay
there
was
nothing
much
really
she
too
had
come
to
look
for
amber
and
other
things
i
do
know
about
the
other
things
but
she
did
find
the
amber
at
eleven
after
seeing
something
of
the
place
we
slipped
away
toward
machynlleth
along
a
hilly
road
which
grew
lovelier
with
each
of
its
many
twists
among
low
mountains
now
said
sir
lionel
we
were
about
to
see
the
heart
of
wales
and
i
should
soon
have
realized
that
without
his
telling
for
as
we
slowed
down
to
pass
through
little
villages
we
heard
the
children
talking
welsh
a
soft
pleasant
language
which
i
can
only
try
to
describe
by
saying
that
it
sounded
like
whispering
out
loud
but
that
is
a
very
irish
description
the
scenery
was
so
gentle
in
its
beauty
that
my
wild
excited
mood
was
lulled
by
its
soft
influence
the
colour
of
landscape
and
sky
kept
the
delicate
tints
of
spring
though
we
are
in
full
rich
summer
and
there
was
none
of
the
tropical
verdure
we
saw
near
tenby
no
crimson
fountains
of
fuchsias
no
billows
of
roses
and
fierce
southern
flowers
pale
draped
the
gray
or
whitewashed
stone
cottages
rocks
and
crannies
of
walls
were
daintily
fringed
with
ferns
or
cushioned
with
the
velvet
of
moss
and
crusted
with
tarnished
golden
lichen
a
house
rising
pertly
here
and
there
looked
out
of
place
among
dwellings
whose
early
owners
quarried
each
stone
from
among
their
own
mountains
as
we
left
the
fairy
glades
of
those
wooded
hills
for
rugged
mountains
scantily
clad
with
ragged
grass
tried
their
ugly
best
to
blotch
and
spoil
the
scene
but
owing
to
some
strange
charm
of
atmosphere
like
a
gauze
veil
on
the
stage
they
could
not
quite
succeed
by
and
by
the
gauze
veil
turned
to
rain
but
rain
suited
the
wild
landscape
far
better
by
the
way
than
it
suited
senter
whose
nightly
are
but
a
reed
to
lean
upon
in
wet
weather
she
made
some
excuse
to
come
behind
with
emily
and
me
and
before
the
car
started
again
i
summoned
courage
to
ask
if
i
might
take
her
place
saying
i
loved
to
feel
the
rain
so
there
i
was
with
sir
lionel
once
more
and
i
wondered
if
he
thought
of
that
night
when
we
rushed
through
the
storm
from
tintagel
to
clovelly
soon
this
also
bade
fair
to
be
a
storm
for
the
rain
began
to
tumble
out
of
the
sky
rather
than
fall
as
if
an
army
of
people
stood
throwing
down
water
by
the
bucketful
i
revelled
in
it
and
in
the
sombre
scenery
where
sharp
rocks
stood
out
like
bones
through
the
tattered
green
coats
of
all
the
world
was
gray
or
save
for
a
patch
of
purple
heather
here
and
there
like
the
stain
of
a
new
wound
we
were
under
cadir
idris
mounting
the
pass
high
above
a
deep
ravine
yet
the
blowing
rain
hid
the
mountain
from
our
eyes
as
if
he
were
the
veiled
prophet
the
sound
of
the
wind
which
seemed
to
come
from
all
quarters
at
once
was
like
the
mysterious
music
of
a
great
æolian
harp
as
it
mingled
with
the
song
of
ghostly
cascades
that
veined
the
dark
rocks
with
marble
mountain
sheep
sprang
from
crag
to
crag
as
apollo
rounded
a
corner
and
broke
into
their
tranquil
lives
now
and
then
loosening
a
stone
as
they
jumped
one
rock
would
have
bounced
down
on
the
roof
of
our
car
if
sir
lionel
had
seen
it
coming
and
put
on
such
a
spurt
of
speed
that
apollo
leaped
ahead
of
the
danger
but
he
always
does
see
things
in
time
you
would
think
sheep
could
have
as
much
expression
as
those
sheep
had
when
they
saw
us
and
were
sure
which
way
to
run
of
course
they
need
have
run
at
all
but
whichever
way
they
decided
it
was
certain
to
be
wrong
i
was
sorry
to
leave
that
pass
behind
and
have
its
door
shut
after
us
for
we
came
out
into
a
pastoral
landscape
where
the
only
wild
things
were
the
grazing
black
cattle
it
was
charming
country
though
and
in
less
than
a
mile
we
had
reached
a
famous
spot
known
as
the
tourist
walk
the
rain
was
pelting
down
harder
than
ever
so
we
could
not
get
out
and
take
the
walk
but
soon
after
we
had
abandoned
it
the
deluge
suddenly
turned
from
lead
to
a
thick
spray
of
diamonds
mixed
with
sparkling
our
road
glittered
ahead
of
us
like
a
wide
silver
ribbon
unrolled
as
we
sailed
into
the
little
gray
town
of
dolgelly
on
its
torrent
river
and
beyond
in
a
radiance
of
sunlight
the
way
was
one
long
enchantment
the
sweet
world
of
green
hills
and
musical
waters
looking
as
young
as
if
god
had
made
it
that
day
the
graceful
mountains
which
pressed
round
the
valley
had
the
air
of
waiting
each
her
turn
to
stoop
and
drink
a
draught
from
the
river
which
as
we
neared
barmouth
opened
to
the
sea
gleaming
like
a
vast
sheet
of
quicksilver
further
on
travelling
through
woods
where
young
green
trees
shot
up
from
gilded
rocks
glimpses
of
the
estuary
came
to
us
like
a
vision
of
some
italian
lake
just
before
harlech
the
wild
yet
beauty
of
the
world
changed
to
an
almost
startling
grandeur
for
the
coast
moved
back
from
the
sea
with
a
noble
sweep
magnificent
mountains
towered
along
the
shore
and
line
after
line
of
beryl
waves
shattered
into
pearl
upon
a
beach
of
darkened
gold
harlech
castle
was
an
event
in
my
life
i
thought
i
had
begun
to
take
ruined
castles
for
granted
in
wales
as
you
do
on
the
shore
but
harlech
is
a
castle
that
you
could
take
for
granted
it
was
a
shock
at
first
to
find
that
a
hotel
had
been
built
in
the
very
face
of
it
as
if
bearding
it
in
its
den
yet
it
is
a
nice
hotel
and
when
we
had
lunched
there
agreeably
i
not
only
forgave
it
for
existing
but
began
to
like
and
thank
it
for
having
thoughtfully
placed
itself
on
that
admirable
height
from
here
our
eyes
ought
to
have
been
smitten
with
the
sight
of
snowdon
but
the
grand
old
mountain
was
asleep
his
head
buried
in
white
which
alone
betrayed
his
whereabouts
so
we
had
to
be
content
with
the
castle
and
i
was
content
to
see
the
splendid
ruin
reared
on
its
great
rock
dark
against
sea
and
sky
was
thrilling
as
a
vision
of
an
old
wounded
knight
girding
his
strength
for
a
last
stand
illustration
splendid
ruin
reared
on
its
great
history
says
that
harlech
castle
is
no
older
than
edward
but
story
says
which
is
more
important
because
more
romantic
that
in
the
dim
dawn
while
history
still
dozed
here
rose
the
tower
of
twr
brauwen
sister
of
bran
the
blessed
also
it
came
into
the
possession
of
hawis
gadern
a
great
beauty
and
heiress
whose
uncles
tried
to
wrest
it
from
her
but
were
defeated
and
imprisoned
in
the
castle
anyway
however
that
may
be
owen
glendower
came
and
conquered
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
when
he
was
forging
a
chain
of
wonderful
deeds
which
made
him
the
hero
of
wales
never
mind
if
he
was
driven
away
a
few
years
after
by
prince
henry
that
another
story
the
way
from
harlech
by
portmadoc
to
exquisite
pont
aberglaslyn
and
beddgelert
is
very
arthurian
that
is
it
suggests
backgrounds
and
at
every
turn
i
caught
myself
expecting
to
come
upon
camelot
unspoiled
unchanged
the
high
mountains
still
wore
their
invisibility
masks
but
the
lower
mountains
not
too
proud
to
show
themselves
to
motoring
mortals
grouped
as
graciously
together
as
if
they
were
lovely
ladies
and
gay
knights
turned
to
stone
just
when
they
had
assembled
to
tread
a
minuet
and
the
fair
glaslyn
flowed
past
their
feet
with
a
swing
and
sweep
as
though
the
crystal
flood
kept
time
to
dance
music
which
our
ears
were
not
attuned
to
catch
quickly
we
flashed
by
more
than
one
beautiful
lake
too
a
jewel
hidden
among
mountains
found
by
our
eyes
unexpectedly
only
to
be
lost
again
and
all
the
while
cader
idris
and
snowdon
drew
hoods
of
mist
over
their
heads
pulling
them
down
tightly
and
firmly
not
once
had
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
either
mountain
though
we
were
almost
near
enough
to
knock
our
noses
or
apollo
bonnet
against
their
sharp
elbows
but
we
were
too
happy
to
care
much
at
least
one
of
us
was
and
we
cared
even
less
when
rain
came
on
again
i
still
kept
my
place
beside
sir
lionel
who
was
repentant
for
having
made
me
cry
over
the
dreadful
agonizing
story
of
gelert
i
wo
repeat
it
to
you
because
wickedly
sad
and
grayhound
gelert
was
so
much
nobler
than
most
people
sheets
of
spun
glass
shimmered
and
waved
before
us
as
we
rushed
on
through
the
mountains
past
the
beautiful
place
of
gelert
grave
up
toward
and
the
tinkling
swish
of
the
rain
on
the
glass
sounded
to
me
as
the
welsh
names
had
begun
to
sound
i
wish
you
could
hear
them
spoken
for
the
spelling
gives
no
idea
of
their
pronunciation
or
the
pleasant
muffled
music
of
them
but
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
when
you
come
into
wales
you
will
feel
they
are
characteristic
of
the
country
mysterious
sympathetic
rather
secretive
sir
lionel
was
happy
in
the
thought
of
because
some
of
the
best
memories
of
his
boyhood
are
associated
with
that
little
spot
in
the
of
wales
he
used
to
come
and
climb
with
an
old
friend
a
few
years
older
than
himself
a
colonel
who
is
in
bengal
now
and
who
he
thinks
will
like
me
not
much
chance
of
our
ever
meeting
just
as
sir
lionel
finished
quoting
charles
kingsley
on
we
drew
up
in
front
of
a
low
gray
stone
building
and
kingsley
merry
words
rang
in
my
ears
as
the
door
of
the
hotel
opened
you
know
i
can
always
remember
a
verse
after
having
once
heard
it
there
is
no
inn
in
snowden
which
is
not
awful
dear
excepting
you
ca
pronounce
it
dear
which
standeth
in
the
meeting
of
noble
valleys
three
one
is
the
vale
of
gwynant
so
well
beloved
by
me
one
goes
to
capel
curig
and
i
ca
mind
its
name
and
one
it
is
llanberis
pass
which
all
men
knew
the
same
never
did
any
gesture
give
a
better
welcome
than
the
opening
of
that
door
we
been
too
happy
to
know
we
were
cold
with
the
chill
of
the
mountains
shapes
that
hovered
close
with
white
cascades
like
ghosts
flitting
ever
across
their
dimness
but
when
a
glow
of
firelight
streamed
out
to
greet
us
suddenly
we
realized
that
we
were
shivering
in
the
square
hall
several
men
were
talking
together
men
with
oxford
voices
and
faces
in
their
midst
was
one
man
much
older
grizzled
and
not
a
gentleman
in
the
conventional
sense
yet
in
listening
to
him
the
others
had
an
air
of
deference
as
if
he
were
a
hero
to
the
group
the
four
or
five
figures
stood
out
like
a
virile
impressionist
sketch
in
black
and
brown
on
a
red
background
but
as
we
entered
welcomed
by
some
young
hostess
the
ruddy
light
danced
into
our
eyes
the
men
in
front
of
the
fire
moved
a
little
as
if
to
give
place
and
glances
were
thrown
at
us
while
for
an
instant
the
conversation
flagged
then
the
group
was
about
to
return
to
its
own
interests
when
suddenly
out
from
among
the
rest
stepped
the
grizzled
man
he
hesitated
as
if
uncertain
whether
or
no
to
obey
an
impulse
then
came
forward
with
a
modest
yet
eager
air
i
ca
be
mistaken
sir
can
i
he
asked
it
must
be
pendragon
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
li
why
penrhyn
cried
sir
lionel
not
giving
him
time
to
finish
and
seizing
one
of
the
gnarled
brown
hands
he
shook
it
as
if
he
never
meant
to
stop
both
their
faces
had
lighted
up
and
were
beaming
with
joy
the
grizzled
man
seemed
to
have
thrown
off
fifteen
years
in
a
minute
and
sir
lionel
looked
like
a
boy
of
by
this
time
everyone
was
gazing
staring
is
too
rude
a
word
and
the
other
faces
were
beaming
as
well
as
if
the
most
delightful
thing
had
happened
i
am
sure
that
sir
lionel
had
forgotten
the
existence
of
us
three
females
and
had
rushed
back
to
the
bright
dawn
of
his
youth
it
was
the
light
of
that
dawn
i
saw
on
his
face
and
i
found
my
heart
beating
with
excitement
though
i
did
know
why
or
what
it
was
all
about
by
jove
penrhyn
to
think
of
your
being
the
first
man
to
greet
me
on
our
old
sir
lionel
exclaimed
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
i
been
thinking
about
you
all
day
and
your
face
is
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
i
rather
see
you
sir
than
have
a
thousand
pounds
drop
down
on
me
through
the
ceiling
retorted
the
mysterious
hero
i
should
think
so
indeed
they
shook
hands
and
beamed
on
each
other
a
little
more
and
then
sir
lionel
remembered
his
flock
turning
to
us
he
introduced
the
grizzled
man
this
is
my
old
friend
and
guide
owen
penrhyn
said
he
as
if
he
were
drawing
us
into
the
circle
of
a
prince
there
never
was
a
guide
like
him
in
the
welsh
mountains
and
never
will
be
again
jove
it
glorious
to
find
him
at
the
old
business
still
though
in
our
day
together
we
did
carry
this
eh
then
i
saw
that
an
alpine
rope
was
coiled
across
one
of
the
strong
shoulders
clad
in
rough
tweed
and
that
the
great
stout
boots
were
strikingly
trimmed
with
huge
bright
nails
it
like
sir
lionel
to
put
the
praise
on
me
protested
the
dear
old
thing
flushing
up
like
a
boy
why
he
was
the
best
amateur
he
pronounced
the
word
quaintly
and
i
loved
him
for
it
i
ever
see
or
ever
expect
to
see
if
he
gone
on
as
he
began
he
a
broken
the
noses
of
some
of
us
guides
pity
he
had
to
go
to
furrin
parts
and
be
bound
he
never
told
you
ladies
of
his
first
ascent
of
twll
ddu
or
how
he
pulled
me
up
out
of
the
torrent
by
sheer
strength
when
my
fingers
were
that
cold
i
could
grip
the
i
fallen
clear
to
the
bottom
of
the
devil
kitchen
had
been
for
pendragon
as
he
was
then
and
what
d
you
think
ladies
he
says
when
i
accused
him
o
savin
my
life
what
i
begged
to
know
forgetting
to
give
my
elders
a
chance
to
speak
first
rot
that
his
very
words
i
never
forgot
rot
he
beamed
on
us
and
every
one
in
the
hall
laughed
except
perhaps
emily
who
smiled
doubtfully
not
sure
whether
or
no
it
was
to
her
brother
credit
to
have
remarked
tommy
rot
in
such
a
crisis
but
after
that
we
were
all
friends
we
and
owen
penrhyn
and
the
other
men
too
for
though
we
did
really
talk
to
them
till
dinner
i
knew
by
their
eyes
that
they
admired
sir
lionel
immensely
and
wanted
to
know
us
all
at
dinner
there
was
splendid
climbing
talk
and
we
heard
further
tales
of
sir
lionel
prowess
among
others
of
a
great
jump
he
had
made
from
one
rock
of
trifaen
to
the
other
with
only
a
little
square
of
rock
to
light
upon
just
on
the
edge
of
a
sheer
precipice
a
record
feat
according
to
the
old
guide
and
while
the
men
and
we
women
listened
the
wind
outside
raged
so
wildly
that
now
and
then
it
seemed
as
if
a
giant
fell
against
the
house
and
afterward
dashed
pebbles
against
it
in
his
fury
then
again
the
would
rush
by
the
hotel
in
his
tooting
his
horn
as
he
went
it
was
nice
sitting
there
in
the
comfortable
listening
to
the
climbing
stories
while
the
wind
roared
and
could
get
at
us
and
the
whole
valley
was
full
of
marching
rain
now
i
am
writing
in
my
bedroom
close
to
a
gossipy
little
fire
which
is
a
delightful
companion
although
august
has
still
a
day
to
run
senter
is
having
her
beauty
sleep
i
suppose
and
i
should
think
norton
is
reading
young
night
thoughts
i
know
she
takes
the
book
about
with
her
the
men
are
still
in
the
hall
downstairs
very
happy
if
one
can
judge
by
the
laughter
that
breaks
out
often
and
i
am
as
happy
as
i
can
be
with
the
thought
of
dick
probably
appearing
at
chester
day
after
night
but
i
wo
let
myself
think
of
that
too
much
because
it
is
certain
that
he
will
get
back
then
and
it
certain
that
there
will
be
some
word
from
you
which
may
change
everything
you
see
what
faith
your
girl
has
in
you
but
would
she
be
ungrateful
if
she
had
there
is
one
other
thing
which
has
been
bothering
me
in
odd
moments
though
and
i
wish
i
had
asked
your
advice
about
that
too
in
the
letter
to
be
answered
at
chester
but
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
then
it
suddenly
sprang
into
my
mind
last
night
when
i
was
lying
in
bed
not
able
to
go
to
sleep
ought
i
to
repeat
to
ellaline
what
senter
told
me
about
the
money
i
do
mean
the
part
about
the
poor
child
father
and
mother
no
one
but
a
thorough
pig
of
the
universe
would
tell
a
daughter
perfectly
unnecessary
horrors
like
those
but
about
her
not
being
an
heiress
in
her
own
right
and
depending
on
sir
lionel
for
everything
except
two
hundred
a
year
if
i
were
really
in
her
place
instead
of
pretending
to
be
i
should
want
to
know
and
should
thank
anyone
for
keeping
the
truth
from
me
it
would
be
unbearable
to
accept
generosity
from
a
man
thinking
i
might
be
as
extravagant
as
i
liked
with
my
own
money
but
it
is
difficult
to
make
up
my
mind
on
account
of
the
you
being
french
yourself
know
how
it
is
with
french
officers
who
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
who
has
no
or
only
a
small
one
most
of
them
if
poor
themselves
would
slap
their
foreheads
and
despair
but
think
it
their
duty
to
their
country
to
forget
the
girl
i
afraid
the
adorable
honoré
is
rather
poor
and
though
no
normal
young
man
especially
a
frenchman
could
help
being
fascinated
by
ellaline
if
thrown
in
her
society
many
normal
young
men
would
be
more
ready
to
let
themselves
go
believing
her
to
be
an
heiress
perhaps
honoré
would
have
proposed
if
he
had
thought
ellaline
a
very
rich
as
well
as
a
very
pretty
girl
perhaps
if
he
found
out
even
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
that
she
depends
upon
a
person
whom
she
has
just
slighted
and
deceived
he
might
desert
her
would
that
be
awful
not
that
i
think
ellaline
would
tell
him
if
i
wrote
to
her
exactly
what
i
heard
from
senter
fascinating
as
she
is
it
is
in
her
to
be
frank
i
sure
she
would
keep
the
secret
until
after
her
lover
was
safely
her
husband
but
she
would
be
upset
and
even
more
anxious
about
the
future
than
she
is
i
do
know
what
to
do
and
in
the
last
letter
i
had
from
her
she
scolded
me
for
continually
praising
sir
lionel
she
is
sure
i
am
mistaken
about
him
and
that
if
i
can
see
any
good
under
the
scales
the
evil
monster
must
have
hypnotized
me
she
really
seemed
quite
vexed
maybe
i
shall
hear
from
her
at
chester
i
hope
so
as
i
rather
worried
because
she
did
write
to
the
last
address
i
was
able
to
give
whatever
message
your
expected
letter
or
telegram
has
for
me
i
will
answer
it
at
once
good
night
dearest
little
dame
wisdom
with
more
love
than
ever
from
your
audrie
i
so
glad
we
are
staying
here
all
day
and
night
there
are
dozens
of
beautiful
things
to
see
and
besides
it
is
as
safe
as
the
inmost
circle
of
a
labyrinth
from
dick
who
has
no
clue
xxxii
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
hotel
we
been
in
chester
for
several
hours
my
angel
and
not
only
is
there
no
dick
for
which
heaven
be
praised
but
no
word
from
you
which
worries
me
still
i
sha
be
really
anxious
unless
on
my
second
call
at
the
to
be
made
by
and
by
i
draw
a
blank
again
at
least
i
did
draw
a
blank
exactly
when
i
went
there
before
i
drew
a
letter
from
ellaline
with
vexing
news
honoré
de
guesclin
is
in
a
scrape
he
could
get
leave
now
and
come
to
her
but
he
and
some
of
his
brother
officers
have
been
amusing
themselves
by
learning
to
play
bridge
naturally
those
who
played
best
came
off
best
and
honoré
was
one
of
them
he
has
borrowed
of
a
and
is
in
a
hole
because
the
fellow
wo
let
him
have
more
and
is
bothering
for
a
settlement
also
honoré
owes
some
of
his
friends
and
has
a
penny
to
pay
up
or
start
on
a
journey
ellaline
does
seem
to
think
much
about
the
moral
aspect
of
her
honoré
affairs
you
see
she
knows
nothing
of
what
her
mother
must
have
suffered
from
her
father
but
she
is
in
a
great
state
of
nerves
about
the
delay
she
has
always
been
told
it
was
bad
luck
to
put
off
a
wedding
and
besides
she
finds
scotland
and
wants
to
be
married
you
can
guess
to
what
all
this
is
leading
up
i
must
get
money
somehow
anyhow
but
a
great
deal
and
immediately
i
must
send
her
at
least
four
thousand
francs
by
return
of
post
five
thousand
if
possible
but
if
monsieur
le
dragon
is
too
stingy
to
give
more
at
all
events
nothing
less
will
be
of
the
least
use
it
easy
for
her
to
dictate
terms
she
has
got
to
face
the
very
upright
and
honourable
gentleman
whom
she
calls
the
dragon
whereas
i
have
and
i
already
shamed
myself
by
asking
for
large
sums
at
short
intervals
i
simply
ca
go
to
him
here
and
hold
him
up
for
four
thousand
francs
it
would
be
monstrous
and
if
he
asked
what
i
wanted
to
do
with
it
as
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
only
his
duty
to
ask
the
young
schoolgirl
he
thinks
me
i
should
be
able
to
find
no
decent
excuse
as
i
have
no
expenses
beyond
those
he
pays
however
i
shall
have
to
do
something
desperate
i
do
know
yet
what
he
has
given
me
some
pretty
things
and
though
i
hate
the
thought
of
parting
with
them
in
such
a
way
as
they
ellaline
by
rights
it
no
more
than
fair
she
should
benefit
by
them
in
the
hour
of
her
need
poor
girl
of
course
nothing
for
it
but
she
must
marry
the
young
man
now
yet
it
seems
a
poor
outlook
does
it
she
explains
in
a
that
she
was
too
upset
to
write
me
to
the
last
place
as
she
had
heard
from
honoré
when
she
expected
but
now
if
the
money
is
forthcoming
all
right
he
will
start
for
scotland
as
soon
as
possible
after
receiving
it
from
her
and
settling
up
i
have
calculated
times
as
well
as
i
could
and
fancy
that
if
i
can
in
any
way
send
her
a
order
from
chester
she
and
honoré
may
be
able
to
marry
in
a
week
once
i
should
have
believed
i
could
be
sorry
to
have
my
principal
arrive
and
take
back
her
own
part
but
now
if
it
were
for
dick
burden
it
would
actually
be
a
temptation
to
me
to
delay
ellaline
appearance
on
the
scene
of
course
i
would
be
such
a
wicked
wretch
as
to
yield
to
the
temptation
but
i
should
feel
it
ellaline
promises
to
telegraph
the
moment
honoré
arrives
and
again
when
they
safely
married
so
as
to
give
the
understudy
plenty
of
time
to
scuttle
off
the
stage
before
the
guardian
is
informed
that
his
charge
has
been
taken
off
his
hands
she
does
want
to
see
sir
lionel
she
says
but
she
and
honoré
will
write
him
unless
when
honoré
has
consulted
a
scottish
solicitor
if
that
what
they
called
considered
wiser
for
the
lawyer
himself
to
write
so
you
see
this
makes
it
harder
for
me
to
know
what
to
do
about
repeating
senter
story
if
ellaline
understood
her
position
she
would
perhaps
think
it
better
to
come
with
her
bridegroom
and
throw
herself
at
her
injured
feet
what
a
nice
world
this
would
be
if
your
affairs
did
get
so
hopelessly
tangled
up
with
other
people
that
you
can
hardly
call
your
conscience
your
own
and
never
have
i
realized
the
niceness
of
the
world
more
fully
than
in
the
last
few
days
illustration
towers
and
turrets
still
dominate
bridge
and
yesterday
i
had
a
little
easy
climb
with
sir
lionel
and
the
old
guide
and
saw
the
glory
of
llanberis
pass
on
the
wings
of
apollo
we
have
flown
through
amazingly
interesting
country
it
really
did
seem
like
flying
because
the
road
surface
was
so
like
velvet
stretched
over
elastic
steel
that
eyesight
alone
told
us
we
touched
earth
miles
are
tyrants
any
more
but
slaves
to
the
mastery
of
good
and
any
motoring
monte
cristo
can
fairly
exclaim
the
world
is
mine
b
this
is
original
sir
lionel
said
it
at
lunch
from
north
wales
to
cheshire
looks
a
long
run
on
the
map
but
motors
are
made
to
live
down
maps
and
we
arrived
in
this
astonishingly
perfect
old
town
early
in
the
afternoon
coming
by
way
of
capel
curig
whence
we
saw
snowdon
crowned
with
a
double
rainbow
sweet
or
station
in
the
wood
and
so
down
the
river
valley
in
a
bird
swoop
to
noble
conway
with
its
castle
that
was
once
a
famous
welsh
fortress
now
in
piping
days
of
peace
its
towers
and
turrets
still
dominate
bridge
and
river
and
the
great
pile
is
as
fine
in
its
way
as
carcassone
you
remember
it
was
from
conway
castle
that
richard
the
second
started
out
to
meet
bolingbroke
we
stopped
to
take
photographs
and
buy
a
few
small
pearls
from
the
river
and
while
we
gazed
our
fill
at
the
mighty
monument
we
learned
from
a
guardian
that
in
old
days
a
certain
lady
erskine
hired
the
castle
for
six
shillings
and
eightpence
a
year
in
addition
to
a
dish
of
fish
for
the
queen
when
her
majesty
chanced
to
pass
at
colwyn
bay
we
lunched
early
at
a
charming
hotel
in
a
garden
above
a
sea
of
mediterranean
blue
and
the
town
along
the
shore
reminded
me
of
dinard
after
that
coming
by
abergele
and
rhuddlan
to
chester
the
way
was
no
longer
through
a
region
of
romance
and
untouched
beauty
there
were
quarries
which
politely
though
firmly
announced
their
hours
of
blasting
and
road
users
accommodated
themselves
to
the
rules
as
best
they
might
but
there
were
castles
on
the
heights
as
well
as
quarries
in
the
depths
and
though
sir
lionel
says
that
inhabitants
of
wales
never
think
of
turning
to
look
at
such
a
common
object
of
the
seashore
as
a
mere
castle
i
have
come
to
that
state
of
mind
yet
near
rhuddlan
there
was
a
tremendous
battle
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
century
out
of
which
so
many
fine
songs
have
been
made
that
the
welsh
princes
and
nobles
who
were
slain
have
never
lost
their
glory
there
a
castle
too
of
course
but
the
best
thing
that
happened
for
us
was
a
gloriously
straight
road
like
a
road
of
france
and
as
nobody
was
on
it
save
ourselves
at
that
moment
we
did
about
six
miles
before
the
next
moment
when
others
might
claim
a
share
i
believe
the
holyhead
road
is
very
celebrated
soon
we
had
to
turn
our
backs
upon
a
mystic
that
ringed
us
in
and
face
the
sea
once
more
a
wide
whose
line
was
broken
with
great
ships
steaming
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
liverpool
apollo
had
seemed
a
little
faint
before
luncheon
because
of
some
inner
disturbance
but
he
was
flying
fast
as
a
saint
on
his
way
to
paradise
as
we
crossed
the
dee
into
england
out
of
wales
and
sprang
into
gladstone
country
when
people
are
obliged
to
reach
a
town
by
rail
there
must
be
disappointments
to
lovers
of
the
picturesque
as
you
and
i
know
by
experience
it
like
arriving
at
a
house
by
the
tradesmen
entrance
but
with
a
motor
one
sails
up
to
the
front
door
through
the
park
of
all
the
towns
to
which
apollo
has
brought
us
the
entrance
to
chester
was
the
best
the
first
effect
of
colour
left
on
my
eyes
the
impression
of
warm
as
copper
beeches
the
place
seemed
to
be
lit
with
fading
firelight
and
i
wondered
at
the
soft
glow
everywhere
until
i
realized
that
the
big
buildings
the
cathedral
the
great
houses
and
the
old
city
wall
were
all
made
of
rosy
sandstone
you
ca
imagine
how
a
large
town
which
has
lived
as
long
as
chester
has
and
gone
on
growing
could
have
contrived
to
remain
so
satisfyingly
beautiful
or
keep
such
an
air
of
completeness
but
the
secret
is
i
suppose
that
chester
is
canny
as
well
as
bonny
and
being
wise
she
refused
to
throw
away
her
precious
antique
garments
for
glaring
new
ones
when
she
had
to
add
houses
or
even
shops
wherever
possible
she
reproduced
the
charm
and
quaintness
of
the
black
and
white
tudor
or
stuart
buildings
which
are
chester
intimate
treasures
of
course
i
seen
little
of
the
place
yet
but
after
i
had
been
to
the
i
strolled
about
before
coming
back
to
the
hotel
partly
to
recover
from
my
disappointment
in
not
hearing
from
you
partly
because
i
was
so
bewitched
with
my
first
glimpse
that
i
could
bear
to
come
indoors
still
a
stranger
to
the
town
hovering
in
front
of
the
cathedral
a
curious
building
black
in
its
oldest
parts
bright
pink
where
it
has
been
renovated
i
saw
sir
lionel
and
norton
coming
that
was
awkward
because
i
had
said
i
wanted
to
settle
in
before
but
i
explained
vaguely
that
i
changed
my
mind
and
was
invited
to
go
into
the
cathedral
with
them
perhaps
it
was
because
emily
was
with
us
that
nothing
seemed
very
wonderful
in
the
interior
unless
the
carved
oak
in
the
choir
but
the
cloisters
are
beautiful
and
i
liked
the
chapter
house
after
doing
the
cathedral
norton
was
tired
so
sir
lionel
and
i
had
a
walk
alone
an
adventure
senter
would
never
have
allowed
if
she
guessed
i
was
out
of
my
room
she
is
a
dog
in
the
manger
about
walks
she
hates
them
herself
but
she
wo
let
other
people
take
them
without
her
if
she
can
help
it
we
dropped
emily
at
the
hotel
and
had
a
delicious
ramble
speaking
for
myself
through
the
four
extraordinary
streets
which
stand
for
much
in
chester
peculiar
fame
wandering
there
it
was
easy
to
believe
what
the
say
that
nowhere
in
great
britain
does
a
town
exist
which
so
preserves
the
ancient
character
of
all
its
architecture
i
do
know
if
there
are
british
relics
but
the
city
wall
and
gates
are
roman
part
of
the
castle
too
and
since
mediæval
days
nothing
seems
to
have
lost
in
picturesqueness
people
come
from
all
over
the
world
to
see
the
rows
streets
dug
out
below
the
on
which
the
town
was
originally
built
having
shops
and
even
warehouses
on
their
level
with
galleries
above
open
fronted
balustraded
with
black
oak
so
that
these
rows
all
look
as
if
the
houses
were
wide
open
communicating
with
one
another
the
carved
oak
fronts
of
the
houses
and
shops
done
ingeniously
with
strange
pargetting
and
adorned
with
wondrous
windows
are
so
adorably
queer
with
their
stagey
effects
that
i
do
wonder
chester
has
become
a
kind
of
mecca
for
travellers
from
my
native
land
where
most
things
are
new
when
we
had
thus
skimmed
a
little
of
the
cream
from
the
town
itself
we
had
a
walk
on
the
old
wall
while
church
bells
near
and
distant
chimed
but
still
i
do
feel
i
more
than
glanced
at
the
place
we
plan
to
run
out
to
knutsford
which
is
cranford
really
and
i
have
begged
to
start
early
because
if
we
do
though
naturally
i
do
allege
this
reason
we
can
get
off
before
dick
arrives
then
when
we
come
back
we
can
do
more
and
maybe
be
out
when
he
turns
up
at
the
hotel
after
that
event
unless
you
save
me
with
some
miraculous
suggestion
all
pleasure
will
be
over
and
at
best
i
not
looking
forward
with
undiluted
joy
to
because
i
must
not
only
decide
what
to
do
for
ellaline
but
do
it
while
i
was
walking
on
the
wall
with
sir
lionel
just
now
gazing
up
at
or
down
over
the
town
and
dodging
seedy
amateur
guides
whom
we
nicknamed
wallers
i
kept
thinking
thinking
about
what
to
sell
the
only
thing
sir
lionel
has
given
me
of
really
great
value
which
could
be
easily
disposed
of
is
the
ruby
and
diamond
ring
but
how
it
would
hurt
me
to
give
it
up
in
such
a
sordid
way
it
was
my
birthday
present
from
him
and
it
associated
in
my
mind
with
that
night
of
moonlight
in
the
new
forest
when
i
first
knew
i
but
i
sorely
afraid
it
must
be
the
thing
to
go
there
are
several
antique
shops
here
and
i
noticed
when
casting
my
eye
about
one
where
they
make
a
speciality
of
curious
and
rare
jewellery
i
shall
look
at
it
again
more
carefully
when
i
run
out
to
the
in
a
few
minutes
and
perhaps
i
may
have
courage
to
try
and
strike
a
bargain
so
as
to
send
the
money
off
in
the
morning
before
knutsford
if
i
get
it
hour
dearest
i
got
your
wire
now
having
retrieved
it
from
the
poste
restante
and
i
thankful
for
it
thankful
that
you
well
thankful
that
you
do
blame
me
for
anything
i
done
faults
committed
or
mistakes
made
but
alas
i
do
think
the
advice
good
as
it
is
will
be
of
any
use
to
me
you
see
you
do
know
senter
it
would
be
hopeless
for
me
to
try
and
force
her
to
exert
authority
over
dick
burden
in
the
first
place
she
has
no
real
authority
as
apparently
he
has
no
expectations
from
her
and
in
the
second
place
though
i
almost
sure
she
does
know
the
truth
about
me
and
ellaline
she
suspects
that
dick
has
a
hold
over
me
and
after
all
i
submitted
to
from
him
already
it
would
be
impossible
to
bluff
her
into
the
belief
that
i
dare
ask
sir
lionel
to
send
them
both
away
no
my
dear
one
there
little
hope
for
me
in
that
scheme
i
allowed
ellaline
to
make
my
bed
for
me
and
i
must
lie
in
it
although
it
has
proved
to
be
one
of
those
nasty
folding
ones
that
will
shut
and
swallow
me
up
in
a
trap
no
it
cowardly
to
whine
like
that
it
wo
be
pleasant
to
keep
my
promise
to
dick
but
there
have
been
worse
things
and
i
shall
probably
be
able
to
escape
before
long
anyhow
it
will
all
be
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence
as
soon
as
i
am
with
you
again
it
will
be
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
meanwhile
i
am
going
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
it
may
be
becoming
but
that
wo
matter
as
sir
lionel
will
never
look
at
me
and
you
will
see
by
my
letters
in
future
how
well
i
am
getting
on
best
love
to
my
best
loved
from
audrie
xxxiii
sir
lionel
pendragon
to
colonel
patrick
my
dear
pat
here
we
are
you
see
in
the
happy
hunting
ground
where
you
and
i
used
to
hunt
such
shy
game
as
chimneys
needles
crevices
etc
and
if
i
not
as
happy
in
it
now
as
i
ought
to
be
that
is
the
fault
of
the
country
which
is
as
fair
as
it
ever
was
the
fairest
in
england
perhaps
it
just
happens
unfortunately
that
i
been
rubbed
up
the
wrong
way
before
coming
to
the
places
i
looked
forward
to
revisiting
more
than
any
other
except
cornwall
and
if
i
had
invited
dear
old
penrhyn
from
to
meet
me
here
and
have
a
climb
i
not
sure
i
should
have
stopped
however
i
have
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
the
run
i
must
have
been
as
blind
as
a
mole
and
as
earthy
if
i
had
fine
road
from
chester
to
liverpool
which
city
had
an
air
of
opulent
magnificence
seen
from
the
ferry
as
we
neared
her
rather
like
a
huge
modern
venice
lunched
there
at
the
adelphi
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
had
some
trouble
finding
the
way
out
of
town
liverpool
welcomes
the
coming
but
does
speed
the
parting
guest
not
a
in
sight
anywhere
bad
pavé
till
ormskirk
when
things
improved
growing
better
and
better
but
no
scenery
to
speak
of
until
near
preston
villages
all
along
the
line
struck
me
as
being
characteristic
of
that
stern
north
country
which
we
approached
road
too
good
not
to
mean
said
i
to
myself
and
an
a
scout
warned
me
that
they
swarmed
but
luckily
we
were
not
held
up
i
was
in
a
temper
to
have
taken
any
nonsense
lying
down
i
afraid
ran
straight
through
lancaster
which
was
almost
a
pity
as
john
gaunt
castle
is
a
brave
old
fortress
whether
or
no
he
really
built
the
famous
tower
and
at
the
king
arms
we
might
have
got
some
genuine
which
would
have
given
a
taste
of
cumberland
to
the
strangers
as
it
was
the
first
truly
characteristic
things
we
came
upon
were
the
stout
stone
walls
on
which
we
happened
a
little
short
of
kendal
down
to
windermere
a
steep
but
beautiful
run
senter
by
my
side
and
very
enthusiastic
she
seems
to
take
an
unaffected
interest
in
scenery
with
which
you
would
hardly
have
credited
her
in
old
times
she
was
entranced
by
her
first
sight
of
the
lake
which
is
not
surprising
for
to
one
who
has
never
seen
them
the
lakes
must
be
a
revelation
dick
burden
by
the
way
was
not
with
us
on
this
run
nor
was
he
at
chester
he
had
business
in
london
which
kept
him
longer
than
he
expected
when
he
left
our
party
at
tintern
i
ca
say
i
regret
him
though
others
may
i
understand
that
there
has
been
some
telegraphing
between
him
and
his
aunt
and
that
his
present
intention
is
to
rejoin
us
at
newcastle
rather
wish
he
would
put
off
his
return
a
little
longer
as
it
is
arranged
that
we
go
out
to
cragside
and
bamborough
castle
and
one
does
like
to
abuse
such
delightful
hospitality
as
we
have
been
offered
there
dick
presence
does
not
add
to
the
gaiety
of
nations
it
seems
to
me
and
i
am
not
keen
on
taking
him
i
found
penrhyn
waiting
for
me
here
the
good
fellow
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
his
short
visit
and
he
and
i
will
have
some
small
climb
i
shall
send
the
car
with
young
nick
to
drive
all
who
care
to
go
to
a
few
of
the
beauty
spots
while
i
am
otherwise
occupied
they
must
penetrate
the
cloistered
charms
of
exquisite
borrodaile
and
of
course
see
lodore
which
ought
to
be
at
its
best
now
as
there
have
been
heavy
rains
jove
how
the
cumberland
names
ring
on
the
ear
like
the
horns
of
elfland
helvelyn
rydal
ennerdale
derwent
water
glaramara
are
they
all
as
crystal
as
the
depths
of
mountain
tarns
or
that
amethystine
colour
of
the
sky
behind
the
clear
profiles
of
high
peaks
i
sorry
we
too
late
for
the
grasmere
sports
but
the
fact
is
we
have
lingered
by
the
way
longer
than
i
planned
for
this
trip
and
now
as
things
are
turning
out
i
inclined
to
cut
the
end
of
the
tour
short
graylees
is
practically
ready
for
occupation
and
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
be
there
no
that
is
good
enough
for
you
old
chap
it
true
as
far
as
it
goes
but
you
have
begun
to
read
between
the
lines
by
this
time
i
know
and
i
may
as
well
speak
out
i
should
be
an
ostrich
if
i
were
sure
that
you
been
saying
to
yourself
why
does
this
fellow
refer
to
the
girl
he
has
spent
so
much
pen
and
paper
on
why
does
he
go
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
mentioning
her
name
well
she
has
eloped
or
done
anything
culpable
but
there
is
no
use
concealing
from
you
as
i
have
told
you
so
much
that
she
has
hurt
me
to
the
quick
not
that
she
has
been
unkind
or
rude
or
disagreeable
quite
the
contrary
and
that
the
worst
of
it
for
i
prayed
to
heaven
that
there
might
be
nothing
of
her
mother
in
this
young
soul
at
first
as
you
know
i
could
hardly
believe
the
girl
to
be
all
she
seemed
but
soon
she
won
me
to
thinking
her
perfection
a
lily
grown
by
some
miracle
of
nature
in
a
soil
where
weeds
had
flourished
hitherto
i
would
have
given
my
right
hand
rather
than
have
to
admit
a
flaw
in
her
that
is
the
one
fatal
flaw
slyness
hidden
under
apparent
frankness
which
means
an
inherited
tendency
to
deceit
this
may
sound
as
if
i
had
found
the
poor
child
out
in
a
lie
but
there
has
been
no
spoken
lie
she
has
only
done
the
sort
of
thing
i
might
have
expected
ellaline
de
nesville
daughter
to
do
i
told
you
about
the
ring
i
bought
her
at
winchester
and
gave
her
on
her
birthday
how
prettily
she
received
it
how
she
seemed
to
treasure
it
more
because
of
the
thought
and
the
association
than
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
ruby
and
the
brilliants
at
chester
the
night
before
we
left
i
thought
i
try
to
pick
up
some
little
souvenir
of
the
town
for
her
as
she
was
delighted
with
the
place
of
course
i
wanted
something
small
as
our
luggage
is
of
the
expanding
order
so
i
had
the
idea
of
jewellery
a
little
antique
pendant
or
a
few
old
paste
buttons
there
is
a
certain
shop
in
the
rows
where
one
looks
for
such
things
and
expects
to
find
them
good
if
highly
priced
in
the
window
of
that
shop
i
saw
displayed
for
sale
the
ring
i
had
given
to
ellaline
the
sight
of
it
there
was
a
blow
but
i
persuaded
myself
i
might
be
mistaken
that
it
was
the
same
ring
but
another
almost
a
duplicate
i
went
in
and
asked
to
look
at
it
the
shopman
mentioned
that
it
was
something
quite
unusually
good
and
had
only
come
in
that
afternoon
inside
i
found
the
date
which
i
had
had
engraved
on
the
ring
the
date
of
ellaline
birthday
i
bought
it
back
for
a
good
deal
more
than
i
paid
in
winchester
as
this
chap
knew
his
business
thoroughly
but
that
is
a
detail
it
was
merely
to
satisfy
a
kind
of
sentimental
vanity
that
i
wanted
to
get
the
thing
out
of
the
window
and
into
my
own
hands
for
needless
to
say
i
do
intend
to
speak
of
the
matter
at
all
to
ellaline
it
would
humiliate
me
more
than
it
would
her
to
let
her
see
that
i
know
what
she
did
with
her
birthday
present
for
partly
i
blame
myself
i
supposed
that
i
was
fairly
with
money
and
had
no
idea
that
the
girl
could
possibly
want
more
than
she
had
still
i
told
her
to
let
me
know
in
case
she
found
me
thoughtless
and
not
to
hesitate
to
ask
for
anything
she
wanted
she
could
have
had
as
much
as
she
chose
and
i
would
have
put
no
questions
if
i
been
surprised
with
the
largeness
of
the
sums
i
should
have
believed
that
she
had
some
pensioners
to
whom
she
wished
to
be
charitable
for
i
had
begun
to
believe
that
she
could
do
no
wrong
as
i
said
there
was
nothing
culpable
in
selling
the
ring
it
was
hers
she
had
a
right
to
do
as
she
liked
with
it
but
that
she
should
like
to
part
with
it
that
she
should
do
so
knowing
i
would
hate
it
if
i
knew
that
she
should
be
exactly
the
same
with
me
as
if
she
had
done
a
thing
which
she
was
aware
would
distress
me
that
she
had
the
courage
and
frankness
to
come
to
me
and
say
oh
hang
it
all
i
grumbling
and
complaining
like
an
old
prig
perhaps
i
am
one
i
know
dick
burden
thinks
so
we
let
it
go
at
that
i
need
to
explain
to
you
a
matter
which
outwardly
is
insignificant
and
is
significant
to
me
only
for
reasons
which
the
past
will
account
for
to
you
better
than
my
explanations
the
salt
has
gone
out
of
life
a
bit
and
i
think
it
will
do
me
good
to
get
to
graylees
where
i
shall
find
a
thousand
things
to
interest
me
i
daresay
ellaline
will
be
glad
to
settle
down
though
she
is
too
polite
to
show
it
and
i
sure
emily
will
after
a
look
at
the
roman
wall
and
a
sight
of
bamborough
we
shall
run
to
warwickshire
with
few
détours
or
pauses
you
see
by
the
way
that
you
were
wrong
in
thinking
she
could
care
if
there
had
been
the
least
warmth
in
her
heart
for
me
she
could
have
sold
my
ring
i
glad
i
did
make
a
fool
of
myself
penrhyn
wants
to
be
remembered
to
you
yours
ever
pen
xxxiv
sir
lionel
pendragon
to
colonel
hotel
my
dear
pat
you
be
surprised
to
get
another
letter
from
me
on
the
tail
of
the
last
but
there
have
been
developments
in
which
i
think
you
will
be
interested
the
sale
of
the
ring
was
a
mere
preface
to
what
has
followed
we
arrived
at
newcastle
this
afternoon
finding
burden
already
here
i
did
think
the
meeting
between
him
and
ellaline
particularly
cordial
but
appearances
are
deceiving
where
girls
are
concerned
as
i
have
lately
been
reminded
in
more
ways
than
one
about
an
hour
ago
while
i
was
getting
off
some
letters
and
telegrams
i
received
a
message
from
my
ward
asking
if
she
could
see
me
in
the
hotel
the
place
is
so
full
i
could
get
a
private
one
i
went
down
at
once
of
course
dimly
and
foolishly
hoping
that
she
wanted
to
confess
about
the
ring
but
it
was
quite
a
different
confession
she
had
to
make
her
desire
to
be
engaged
to
mr
burden
naturally
after
our
last
conversation
on
that
subject
i
was
somewhat
surprised
and
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
was
tempted
to
remind
her
that
not
long
ago
young
nick
had
appeared
as
suitable
in
her
eyes
as
young
dick
however
i
stopped
in
time
to
save
myself
from
being
both
bounder
and
brute
i
did
inquire
whether
she
were
now
sure
of
her
own
mind
but
it
was
the
duty
of
a
guardian
and
not
the
malice
of
a
disappointed
man
which
prompted
the
question
her
manner
was
singularly
dry
and
businesslike
and
she
came
as
near
to
looking
plain
as
it
is
possible
for
a
beautiful
girl
to
come
so
love
is
always
a
beautifier
i
am
sure
of
my
mind
for
the
moment
she
replied
with
repulsive
prudence
i
suppose
a
girl
need
never
say
more
this
answer
and
her
manner
puzzled
me
so
i
ventured
to
ask
in
a
guardianly
way
if
she
thought
she
were
enough
in
love
with
burden
to
be
happy
with
him
i
have
to
think
about
being
with
him
at
all
yet
she
temporized
you
seem
to
have
an
extraordinary
idea
of
an
engagement
i
said
perhaps
rather
sneeringly
for
i
felt
bitter
and
had
never
approved
of
her
less
perhaps
i
have
she
returned
in
such
an
odd
muffled
sort
of
tone
that
i
feared
she
was
going
to
cry
and
glanced
at
her
sharply
but
she
was
looking
down
and
there
were
no
tears
visible
so
that
fear
was
relieved
you
do
at
all
events
wish
to
be
engaged
to
burden
i
persisted
am
i
to
understand
that
i
have
asked
for
your
consent
she
said
with
a
queer
stiffness
and
it
was
on
my
tongue
to
say
as
stiffly
very
well
you
have
it
what
pleases
you
should
please
me
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
as
if
they
been
lumps
of
ice
and
instead
i
answered
almost
in
spite
of
myself
that
i
could
give
my
consent
unconditionally
i
must
have
another
talk
with
burden
and
whatever
my
decision
might
be
i
would
prefer
that
she
did
consider
herself
engaged
until
after
the
tour
was
ended
we
bring
it
to
a
close
as
soon
as
possible
now
i
added
trying
not
to
sound
as
bitter
as
i
felt
so
as
not
to
keep
you
waiting
she
made
no
response
to
this
except
to
give
me
a
singular
look
which
even
now
i
find
it
impossible
to
understand
it
was
as
if
she
had
something
to
reproach
me
for
and
yet
as
if
she
were
more
pleased
than
sad
girls
are
very
complicated
human
beings
if
indeed
they
can
be
classified
thus
though
perhaps
some
men
lives
would
be
duller
if
they
were
simpler
as
for
my
life
the
less
girls
have
to
do
with
it
when
my
ward
is
off
my
hands
the
better
since
the
above
conversation
i
have
been
drawn
into
a
talk
with
burden
he
appeared
anxious
to
find
out
exactly
what
had
passed
between
ellaline
and
me
almost
as
if
he
suspected
her
of
not
playing
straight
but
i
replied
briefly
that
she
had
asked
my
permission
to
be
engaged
to
him
having
evidently
changed
her
mind
since
our
last
discussion
on
the
subject
this
appeared
to
content
him
more
or
less
although
i
repeated
what
i
said
to
the
girl
that
i
was
not
prepared
to
consent
officially
until
i
had
communicated
with
his
mother
and
satisfied
myself
that
my
ward
would
be
welcomed
in
the
family
this
he
evidently
thought
and
but
when
i
admitted
being
both
he
ceased
to
protest
only
saying
that
he
wished
to
write
to
his
mother
first
i
suggested
talking
with
his
aunt
also
and
he
did
not
object
to
the
idea
so
senter
and
i
have
already
had
a
short
conversation
concerning
her
nephew
love
affair
she
cried
a
little
and
said
that
she
would
be
horribly
alone
in
the
world
when
her
only
real
pal
was
married
but
that
of
course
she
wished
for
his
happiness
above
everything
and
she
meant
to
give
him
a
wedding
present
worth
having
if
she
beggared
herself
for
years
the
poor
little
woman
showed
a
great
deal
of
heart
and
i
was
touched
i
afraid
she
not
too
happy
under
her
air
of
almost
flippant
gaiety
and
smartness
for
she
rather
hinted
that
she
liked
some
man
who
did
care
for
her
someone
she
met
in
the
east
i
suppose
she
ca
be
cherishing
a
hidden
passion
for
you
rather
cruel
of
us
accusing
her
of
being
a
flirt
in
those
days
if
she
were
in
earnest
all
the
time
eh
in
case
i
pump
her
a
little
about
this
mysterious
disappointment
and
find
it
you
she
thinking
of
i
may
turn
the
tables
and
give
you
some
good
advice
better
than
you
gave
me
you
might
do
worse
than
get
leave
and
have
another
look
at
this
pretty
and
agreeable
lady
before
deciding
to
let
her
slip
yours
always
pen
good
old
owen
enjoyed
his
two
days
in
cumberland
he
too
tried
his
hand
on
advising
me
said
i
ought
to
marry
not
i
xxxv
senter
to
her
sister
mrs
burden
my
dear
sis
this
is
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
you
and
you
must
be
a
pet
and
grant
it
there
nothing
i
wo
do
for
you
in
return
if
you
will
i
have
just
been
having
a
most
satisfactory
chat
with
sir
it
began
in
reference
to
dick
somehow
or
other
that
ingenious
darling
had
forced
ellaline
lethbridge
to
ask
sir
lionel
for
his
dick
hand
i
say
forced
because
she
is
not
in
the
least
in
love
with
him
indeed
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
detests
the
ground
he
walks
on
yet
she
does
things
that
he
tells
her
to
do
things
she
hates
like
poison
this
last
of
dick
convinces
me
of
what
i
often
suspected
he
knows
something
about
her
past
which
she
is
deadly
afraid
he
will
tell
sir
lionel
it
may
be
connected
with
that
visit
to
venice
when
the
tyndals
saw
her
anyhow
whatever
the
secret
may
be
it
is
serious
she
is
obliged
to
bribe
dick
but
she
dislikes
him
too
intensely
to
marry
him
ever
even
if
the
way
to
do
so
were
made
easy
so
i
reiterate
have
no
fear
on
that
score
sir
lionel
fancies
himself
in
love
with
the
girl
but
he
will
get
over
it
even
if
he
is
on
the
way
to
do
so
already
pushed
roughly
onto
the
right
road
by
her
confessed
preference
for
dick
for
the
moment
however
i
can
see
he
is
rather
hard
hit
though
he
would
be
if
he
dreamed
i
or
anyone
could
read
his
august
feelings
he
thinks
his
hesitation
to
permit
an
engagement
arises
from
conscientious
scruples
but
really
it
because
he
ca
bear
to
have
any
other
man
or
boy
making
love
to
his
girl
that
the
brutal
truth
and
he
haggling
and
putting
off
the
evil
day
as
long
as
he
can
he
wanted
to
ask
me
what
my
feeling
was
in
the
matter
whether
would
be
pleased
and
so
on
ellaline
might
not
be
rich
he
explained
but
she
would
have
enough
for
her
own
wants
as
a
married
woman
he
thought
her
husband
when
she
had
one
ought
to
wish
to
do
the
rest
and
though
dick
considered
his
own
prospects
good
a
partnership
in
a
detective
agency
hardly
seemed
ideal
i
told
him
i
could
quite
answer
for
you
as
you
had
always
hoped
your
one
boy
might
fall
in
love
with
a
rich
girl
but
that
i
was
sure
dick
adored
ellaline
i
asked
if
i
should
write
to
you
when
dick
did
and
he
said
half
reluctantly
perhaps
i
had
better
poor
wretch
he
was
afraid
i
might
succeed
in
persuading
you
i
was
pathetic
on
the
subject
of
dick
and
our
comradeship
which
must
be
broken
by
the
dear
boy
marriage
and
as
sir
was
suffering
himself
he
was
in
just
the
right
mood
to
sympathize
with
me
i
snivelled
a
little
and
at
last
emboldened
by
success
i
allowed
him
to
gather
that
there
was
someone
i
cared
for
a
long
long
time
someone
who
did
care
for
me
at
that
he
was
so
nice
that
i
liked
him
better
than
i
ever
thought
i
could
and
since
then
i
feel
i
really
ca
and
sha
lose
him
no
sooner
had
he
given
my
hand
a
warm
yet
disappointing
kind
friend
squeeze
at
parting
than
i
routed
out
dick
in
his
own
room
i
promised
him
that
i
would
induce
you
to
write
a
nice
letter
about
the
proposed
engagement
to
sir
lionel
if
he
in
his
turn
would
persuade
ellaline
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
with
sir
to
tell
him
that
she
believed
i
cared
for
him
a
good
deal
and
was
unhappy
when
i
said
persuade
to
dick
i
meant
use
his
unknown
power
to
command
for
if
the
girl
would
say
that
to
her
guardian
her
words
would
be
the
one
stone
capable
of
killing
two
birds
it
would
prove
to
him
that
of
which
i
do
think
he
is
perfectly
sure
at
present
her
love
for
dick
or
at
worst
her
complete
indifference
to
himself
and
it
would
pop
into
his
head
the
idea
i
want
to
put
there
though
i
have
done
all
it
safe
to
do
openly
toward
inserting
it
i
saw
when
i
softly
hinted
at
a
hopeless
affection
which
had
spoiled
years
of
my
life
that
he
did
think
of
himself
somehow
he
must
be
to
think
and
now
is
the
right
time
for
his
heart
is
sore
and
needs
balm
he
would
be
so
sorry
for
me
that
in
the
state
he
is
in
he
could
be
hard
he
would
argue
that
as
he
was
bound
to
be
unhappy
anyway
he
might
as
well
try
to
make
others
happy
i
feel
that
everything
would
happen
exactly
as
i
want
it
to
happen
if
ellaline
lethbridge
could
be
depended
upon
to
say
the
right
thing
of
course
there
lies
the
danger
that
she
wo
but
dick
boasts
that
she
have
to
do
as
he
tells
her
it
worth
risking
but
he
wo
give
the
word
unless
he
thinks
that
i
coaxed
you
that
the
favour
i
ask
will
you
when
you
get
this
wire
to
me
at
once
writing
according
to
your
request
to
sir
i
can
then
show
your
telegram
to
dick
you
must
address
it
to
me
at
bamborough
castle
where
we
are
to
spend
a
night
after
staying
one
at
cragside
and
he
will
put
pressure
to
bear
on
ellaline
lethbridge
you
can
be
absolutely
certain
that
no
harm
will
come
of
this
that
dick
and
she
will
never
be
married
whereas
when
i
am
married
to
sir
lionel
i
give
you
a
present
of
five
hundred
pounds
within
the
first
year
to
do
with
as
you
like
i
even
be
willing
to
sign
a
paper
to
that
effect
your
anxious
yet
hopeful
gwen
xxxvi
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
dear
i
know
you
are
miserable
about
me
but
do
be
it
because
i
not
miserable
about
myself
honour
bright
i
done
the
hateful
deed
it
was
at
newcastle
and
i
knew
i
was
in
for
it
the
minute
i
saw
dick
he
got
his
partnership
and
thinks
he
got
me
but
there
many
a
slip
dick
burden
and
audrie
brendon
i
would
tell
sir
lionel
i
was
in
love
with
the
horrid
boy
detective
and
i
happy
or
nearly
happy
to
say
that
he
refused
to
give
his
consent
straight
out
to
an
engagement
he
told
dick
the
same
thing
so
there
be
no
leaving
us
two
alone
in
lovesick
corners
can
corners
be
lovesick
or
making
announcements
or
anything
appalling
of
that
sort
perhaps
it
was
easier
speaking
to
sir
lionel
because
he
had
been
kind
to
me
since
the
last
evening
in
chester
i
ca
think
why
though
i
can
think
why
i
deserved
unkindness
the
ring
was
terribly
on
my
mind
but
he
ca
have
found
out
about
that
because
the
man
in
the
shop
promised
he
would
try
to
sell
it
until
next
day
i
could
get
quite
what
ellaline
wanted
though
i
sold
two
or
three
other
things
all
i
could
sell
but
it
came
nearly
to
the
right
amount
and
it
went
off
to
her
in
scotland
in
the
form
of
a
order
that
same
night
assured
instead
of
registered
as
the
letter
was
so
valuable
sir
lionel
being
somewhat
frigid
and
remote
in
his
manner
appearing
to
take
no
more
interest
in
me
than
if
he
were
a
big
star
and
i
a
bit
chipped
off
a
leonid
i
delivered
myself
of
what
i
had
to
say
without
great
difficulty
i
had
a
queer
numbed
feeling
as
though
if
it
matter
to
him
it
did
to
me
until
just
at
the
last
when
he
said
something
that
nearly
made
me
cry
luckily
i
was
able
to
swallow
the
sob
it
felt
like
a
large
hot
crisp
baked
potato
and
my
heart
felt
like
a
larger
beet
soaked
in
vinegar
it
all
over
now
though
and
i
comparatively
callous
maybe
the
vinegar
has
pickled
me
internally
bamborough
castle
where
we
arrived
with
our
kind
and
delightful
hosts
of
cragside
is
to
be
the
northernmost
end
of
the
tour
on
leaving
we
turn
southward
and
would
make
straight
for
warwickshire
and
graylees
if
in
an
evil
moment
norton
and
i
had
for
once
agreed
about
a
place
that
we
longed
to
see
it
is
haworth
where
the
brontës
lived
and
sir
lionel
said
that
our
wish
should
be
gratified
he
planned
a
day
in
yorkshire
ripon
fountains
abbey
haworth
harrogate
not
york
because
emily
went
there
with
the
late
norton
and
has
sad
marital
memories
and
the
plan
still
stands
i
have
an
idea
that
sir
lionel
is
impatient
to
reach
graylees
now
so
after
the
yorkshire
we
will
push
on
there
and
i
shall
perhaps
hear
from
ellaline
as
to
honoré
plans
he
ought
to
be
in
scotland
by
that
time
written
her
to
wire
me
at
the
nearest
to
graylees
castle
as
i
do
like
to
receive
telegrams
there
but
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
send
a
letter
to
graylees
the
last
letter
i
hope
which
need
ever
be
addressed
to
me
as
miss
ellaline
lethbridge
it
will
seem
nice
to
get
into
my
own
name
again
rather
like
putting
on
comfortable
shoes
after
tight
ones
that
made
blisters
and
how
divine
to
fly
to
you
a
distracted
chicken
battered
by
a
thunderstorm
scuttling
back
under
its
mother
downy
wing
nevertheless
i
not
going
to
cheat
you
out
of
seeing
england
through
my
eyes
because
my
pleasure
just
a
little
of
it
is
damped
by
dick
i
am
resigned
and
calm
and
you
must
think
me
a
martyr
i
told
you
i
hate
whiners
and
i
wo
be
one
why
i
ought
to
be
thankful
for
the
chance
of
such
a
wonderful
trip
and
not
be
cowardly
enough
to
spoil
it
by
a
few
private
worries
cumberland
is
even
lovelier
than
wales
though
i
should
have
thought
that
possible
sir
lionel
went
climbing
with
the
nice
welsh
guide
whom
he
invited
to
keswick
so
he
was
with
us
much
and
dick
being
in
london
still
there
were
only
norton
senter
and
i
to
be
conducted
by
young
nick
it
did
seem
odd
being
driven
by
him
and
seeing
his
back
look
so
inexpressive
among
the
most
ravishing
scenes
i
asked
if
he
did
think
cumberland
glorious
but
he
said
it
was
not
like
india
i
suppose
that
was
an
answer
we
spun
off
into
the
mysterious
enchantments
of
borrodaile
in
gusts
of
rain
but
the
heavenly
valley
was
the
more
mystic
because
of
the
showers
huge
white
clouds
walked
ahead
of
us
like
ghosts
of
animals
and
baby
clouds
sprawled
on
the
mountain
sides
with
all
their
filmy
legs
in
air
at
lodore
the
water
was
coming
down
like
a
miniature
niagara
heavy
rains
had
filled
the
cup
of
its
parent
river
full
and
the
waterfall
looked
as
if
floods
of
melted
ivory
were
pouring
over
ebony
boulders
what
a
lovely
rushing
roar
it
was
like
the
father
of
all
sound
as
if
it
might
have
given
the
first
suggestion
of
sound
to
a
silent
world
windermere
and
derwent
water
we
saw
too
and
each
was
more
beautiful
than
the
other
also
i
was
much
excited
about
the
giant
grave
near
keswick
which
has
kept
its
secret
since
before
history
began
all
the
way
to
carlisle
the
country
was
very
fair
to
see
scarcely
flagging
in
charm
to
the
end
and
carlisle
itself
was
packed
with
interest
from
its
old
cathedral
to
the
castle
where
david
of
scotland
died
and
mary
queen
of
scots
lodged
now
our
thoughts
were
turned
toward
the
roman
wall
and
i
thrilled
a
little
despite
the
forbidding
stiffness
of
sir
lionel
disapproving
back
as
he
drove
because
of
kipling
splendid
story
of
the
roman
soldier
in
puck
of
pook
hill
i
knew
that
for
me
the
great
wall
all
that
left
of
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
things
parnesius
the
young
centurion
told
una
and
dan
that
old
men
who
have
followed
the
eagles
since
boyhood
say
nothing
is
more
wonderful
than
the
first
sight
of
the
wall
and
also
that
there
were
no
real
adventures
south
of
it
it
was
disappointing
to
think
that
nowadays
on
our
way
there
we
expect
to
meet
hunters
and
trappers
for
the
circuses
prodding
along
chained
bears
and
muzzled
wolves
for
the
amusement
of
the
soldiers
in
the
far
northern
camps
or
that
when
we
should
come
to
the
wall
find
no
helmeted
men
with
glittering
shields
walking
three
abreast
on
the
narrowest
part
screened
from
picts
by
a
little
at
the
top
as
high
as
their
necks
no
roaring
gambling
soldier
town
on
one
side
and
heather
wastes
full
of
hiding
picts
on
the
other
yet
i
heard
sir
lionel
say
we
could
still
trace
the
and
small
towers
and
see
how
the
great
camp
of
cilurnum
was
laid
out
we
had
left
the
mountains
before
we
came
into
carlisle
but
not
the
hills
and
after
one
of
grandiose
size
which
an
old
northumbrian
we
met
called
a
fair
stiff
bank
we
were
on
the
roman
road
the
long
long
straight
road
forging
uncompromisingly
grimly
up
and
down
ever
on
scorning
to
turn
aside
for
difficulties
the
road
where
the
legions
paced
with
the
brave
roman
step
rome
race
rome
pace
miles
in
eight
hours
kipling
illuminated
the
way
through
haltwhistle
and
chollerford
to
the
chesters
a
private
park
which
is
a
big
museum
for
it
has
in
its
midst
the
remains
of
old
cilurnum
we
got
out
at
the
gates
and
wandered
among
the
ruins
that
have
been
reverently
excavated
a
gray
and
faded
scene
like
a
kind
of
skeleton
pompeii
with
dead
bones
rattling
entrance
gateways
stone
rings
which
were
towers
many
short
straight
streets
whose
pavements
once
rang
under
soldiers
heels
the
forum
all
the
plan
a
map
with
outlines
roughly
sketched
in
stone
on
faded
grass
we
had
had
our
first
sight
of
the
wall
of
which
centurions
in
britain
bragged
when
they
went
back
to
rome
then
it
was
a
living
wall
but
it
is
very
wonderful
still
where
its
skeleton
lies
in
state
we
had
started
so
early
from
keswick
that
it
was
two
when
we
left
the
chesters
and
i
was
surprised
when
instead
of
drawing
up
before
some
country
inn
for
lunch
we
skimmed
through
a
gate
only
a
mile
or
two
away
and
stopped
under
the
shadowy
frown
of
an
imposing
mediæval
stronghold
it
was
haughton
castle
whose
towers
and
keep
are
crowded
with
stories
of
the
past
and
the
visit
was
to
be
a
surprise
for
us
sir
lionel
knew
the
owner
who
had
asked
us
all
to
lunch
for
the
dragon
sake
and
it
looked
quite
an
appropriate
for
a
dragon
of
elegant
leisure
it
was
as
interesting
within
as
without
and
after
luncheon
they
took
us
over
the
castle
best
of
all
down
in
the
deep
dungeon
where
archie
armstrong
a
chief
of
was
forgotten
and
starved
to
death
by
his
captor
sir
thomas
swinburne
a
stout
knight
of
henry
the
eighth
day
there
is
a
long
story
about
archie
too
long
to
tell
you
here
but
each
castle
of
northumberland
the
county
of
castles
not
of
collieries
has
dozens
of
wonderful
old
stories
warlike
ghostlike
tragic
and
romantic
i
have
been
reading
a
book
about
some
of
them
which
i
will
bring
you
it
more
interesting
than
any
novel
and
king
arthur
legends
are
scattered
broadcast
over
northumberland
as
in
cornwall
also
the
scots
wha
hae
wi
wallace
bled
did
much
of
their
bleeding
and
fighting
here
there
history
of
every
sort
to
please
every
taste
from
celtic
times
on
but
i
not
sure
that
the
troublous
days
of
the
great
feudal
barons
were
the
most
passionately
thrilling
of
all
if
the
first
sight
of
the
wall
was
wonderful
to
the
roman
soldiers
so
must
have
been
the
first
sight
of
the
wide
tyne
i
know
it
was
so
to
me
as
we
flashed
upon
it
at
the
first
important
twist
of
the
straight
roman
road
and
crossed
it
on
a
noble
bridge
of
course
newcastle
has
a
castle
and
it
was
new
when
william
the
conqueror
was
new
to
his
kingdom
now
that
i
seen
this
great
rich
gay
busy
city
ancient
and
modern
i
realize
how
stupid
i
was
to
associate
it
with
mere
coal
as
strangers
have
a
way
of
doing
because
of
the
trite
remark
about
taking
coals
to
newcastle
why
the
very
names
of
the
streets
in
the
old
part
chime
with
the
romance
of
history
and
i
like
the
people
of
northumberland
those
i
have
met
the
shrewd
kindly
townsfolk
and
the
country
folk
living
in
gray
villages
who
love
old
old
ways
and
emit
quaint
wit
with
a
strong
rough
burr
they
have
the
look
in
their
eyes
that
northern
people
have
all
the
world
over
a
look
that
can
be
hard
yet
can
be
kinder
than
the
soft
look
of
more
melting
southern
eyes
sir
lionel
is
of
the
south
born
in
cornwall
yet
his
eyes
have
this
northern
glint
in
them
as
if
he
knew
and
understood
mountains
just
now
they
are
terribly
wintry
and
when
they
rest
coldly
on
me
i
feel
as
if
i
were
lost
in
a
snowstorm
without
hat
or
coat
but
no
matter
now
what
shall
i
say
to
you
of
bamborough
castle
which
is
the
crown
of
our
whole
tour
i
wish
i
were
clever
enough
to
make
the
splendour
of
it
burst
upon
you
as
it
did
upon
me
imagine
us
motoring
over
from
cragside
a
very
beautiful
and
famous
modern
house
with
marvellous
gardens
and
enchanting
views
which
belongs
to
these
kind
delightful
friends
of
sir
lionel
who
own
bamborough
castle
there
was
a
at
cragside
and
there
were
twelve
or
fifteen
of
us
who
left
there
in
a
drove
of
automobiles
illustration
were
twelve
or
fifteen
of
us
who
left
down
the
beautiful
winding
avenue
then
out
upon
a
switchback
road
a
dozen
miles
and
more
past
great
alnwick
on
on
until
suddenly
a
vast
dark
shape
loomed
against
the
sky
a
stone
silhouette
not
of
a
giant
profile
but
of
a
whole
vast
family
of
giants
grouped
together
to
face
the
sea
to
a
thing
like
that
must
feel
like
owning
niagara
falls
or
the
marble
range
of
the
sierra
nevada
or
biting
off
a
whole
end
of
england
and
digesting
it
yet
these
charming
people
take
their
ownership
quite
calmly
and
by
filling
the
huge
castle
from
keep
to
farthest
tower
with
their
beautiful
possessions
seem
to
have
tamed
the
splendid
monster
making
it
legitimately
theirs
i
thought
alnwick
grand
as
we
passed
but
its
position
is
insignificant
compared
with
bamborough
which
has
the
wide
north
sea
for
a
background
on
a
craggy
platform
of
black
rock
like
a
petrified
cushion
for
a
royal
crown
it
rises
above
the
sea
a
few
low
foothills
of
golden
sand
drifting
toward
it
ahead
of
the
tide
the
grandeur
of
the
vast
pile
is
almost
overwhelming
to
one
who
like
me
has
never
until
now
seen
any
of
these
mighty
of
the
north
but
a
great
historian
says
that
the
site
of
bamborough
surpasses
the
sites
of
all
other
northumbrian
castles
in
ancient
and
abiding
historic
interest
so
even
if
i
had
been
introduced
to
dozens
my
impression
must
remain
the
same
round
bamborough
and
its
founder
ida
the
all
northumbrian
history
gathers
and
it
is
one
of
the
great
cradles
of
national
life
bamborough
village
close
by
was
once
the
royal
city
of
bernicia
and
the
laidly
worm
was
there
to
give
it
fame
even
if
there
had
never
been
a
grizel
cochrane
or
grace
darling
but
the
history
of
the
hamlet
that
once
was
great
and
the
castle
that
will
always
be
great
are
virtually
one
i
shall
bring
you
besant
dorothy
foster
and
lots
of
fascinating
photographs
which
our
hostess
has
given
me
i
do
think
i
need
leave
them
for
ellaline
as
she
would
care
but
you
know
the
story
of
the
laidly
worm
because
dad
used
to
tell
it
to
me
when
i
was
small
the
wicked
stepmother
who
turned
her
beautiful
stepdaughter
into
the
fearsome
worm
used
to
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
deep
well
that
opens
in
the
stone
floor
of
the
castle
keep
and
there
in
the
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
below
she
still
lurks
in
the
form
of
a
gigantic
toad
i
have
been
allowed
to
peep
down
and
i
sure
i
caught
the
jewelled
sparkle
of
her
wicked
eye
in
the
gloom
but
even
if
she
turned
me
into
a
laidly
worm
i
could
be
more
repulsive
than
i
probably
am
at
present
to
sir
lionel
besides
i
could
crawl
away
into
a
neighbouring
cave
with
modern
improvements
and
console
myself
with
a
good
cry
which
i
ca
do
now
for
fear
of
getting
a
red
nose
i
should
hate
that
because
senter
nose
is
so
and
the
background
of
a
magnificent
feudal
castle
sets
off
her
golden
hair
and
brown
eyes
so
passing
well
illustration
surpasses
all
northumbrian
there
might
be
volumes
of
history
as
well
as
romances
written
about
bamborough
castle
as
sir
walter
scott
and
harrison
ainsworth
and
sir
walter
besant
knew
why
the
thrill
of
unwritten
stories
and
untold
legends
is
in
the
air
from
the
moment
i
passed
through
the
jaws
of
outer
and
inner
gateways
i
seemed
to
hear
whispers
from
lips
that
had
laughed
or
cursed
in
the
days
of
barbaric
grandeur
when
bamborough
was
the
king
of
all
northumbrian
castles
there
are
queer
echoes
everywhere
in
the
vast
rooms
whose
outer
walls
are
twelve
feet
thick
but
more
deliciously
creepy
than
any
other
place
is
the
keep
i
think
even
more
thrilling
than
the
dungeons
yet
the
castle
as
it
is
now
is
far
from
gloomy
i
can
tell
you
not
only
are
there
and
and
and
vast
galleries
which
royalties
might
covet
but
there
are
quantities
of
charming
bedrooms
gay
and
bright
enough
for
débutante
princesses
my
bedroom
where
i
am
writing
is
in
a
turret
quaintly
furnished
with
tapestry
on
the
wall
which
might
have
suggested
to
browning
his
childe
roland
to
the
dark
tower
came
it
very
late
but
i
do
like
to
go
to
bed
partly
because
i
keep
jumping
up
and
down
to
look
out
of
my
window
at
wild
crags
and
moonlit
sea
when
i
asleep
partly
because
i
have
such
silly
miserable
dreams
about
sir
lionel
hating
me
that
i
wake
up
snivelling
and
to
write
to
you
when
i
a
tiny
bit
is
always
like
warming
my
hands
at
a
fire
of
ship
logs
afternoon
we
are
going
back
to
newcastle
where
we
will
lie
one
night
as
old
books
say
and
then
make
a
very
start
to
do
our
great
day
in
yorkshire
passing
first
through
durham
with
just
a
glance
at
the
great
cathedral
once
upon
a
time
we
would
have
given
more
than
a
glance
but
as
i
told
you
sir
lionel
seems
to
have
lost
heart
for
the
long
trail
i
never
saw
him
so
interested
in
senter
as
he
has
appeared
to
be
these
last
two
nights
at
cragside
and
here
certainly
she
is
looking
her
very
very
best
and
in
her
manner
with
him
there
is
a
gentleness
and
womanliness
only
just
developed
one
would
fancy
that
a
sympathetic
understanding
had
established
itself
between
them
as
it
might
if
she
told
him
some
piteous
story
about
herself
which
roused
all
his
chivalry
well
if
she
has
told
him
any
such
story
i
sure
it
is
a
story
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
i
do
know
how
i
should
bear
it
if
she
cajoled
him
into
believing
her
an
injured
innocent
who
needed
the
shelter
of
a
rich
and
titled
man
arm
perhaps
it
is
a
little
sad
wind
that
cries
at
my
window
like
a
baby
begging
to
come
in
perhaps
it
is
just
foolishness
but
i
have
a
presentiment
that
something
will
happen
here
to
make
me
remember
bamborough
castle
forever
not
for
itself
alone
of
next
it
happened
best
one
i
do
quite
know
what
is
going
to
become
of
me
there
has
been
the
most
awful
row
it
was
with
dick
and
sir
lionel
does
know
about
it
yet
and
we
are
supposed
to
be
going
away
in
a
few
minutes
but
maybe
dick
is
talking
to
sir
lionel
now
and
if
he
is
i
do
suppose
i
shall
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
the
company
of
virtuous
emily
and
comparatively
innocent
gwendolen
i
shall
probably
be
given
a
ticket
back
to
paris
and
ordered
to
git
it
rather
hard
that
having
sacrificed
so
much
large
chunks
of
among
other
things
it
should
all
come
to
nothing
in
the
end
ellaline
will
want
to
kill
me
for
i
have
thrown
her
to
the
lions
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
they
do
eat
her
up
oh
darling
i
do
feel
horribly
about
it
and
really
and
truly
without
exaggeration
i
would
have
died
sooner
than
repay
her
kindness
to
me
by
giving
her
away
like
this
an
ancestress
of
yours
in
the
revolution
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
guillotine
laughing
and
kissing
her
hands
to
the
friends
she
left
in
the
tumbril
and
i
could
have
been
almost
half
as
brave
if
by
so
doing
i
might
have
avoided
this
dreadful
abandoning
of
ellaline
interests
trusted
to
me
but
what
can
you
do
between
two
evils
is
it
a
law
of
nature
or
something
to
choose
the
lesser
dick
went
just
the
one
step
too
far
and
pulled
the
chain
too
tight
he
had
begun
to
think
he
could
make
me
do
anything
a
little
while
ago
i
was
alone
in
the
armoury
absorbed
in
looking
at
a
wonderful
engraving
of
the
tragic
last
earl
of
derwentwater
when
suddenly
dick
came
up
behind
me
i
wanted
to
go
and
made
excuses
to
escape
but
he
would
let
me
and
rather
than
have
a
scene
in
case
anyone
might
come
i
let
him
walk
me
about
and
point
out
strange
old
weapons
on
the
wall
that
was
only
a
blind
however
he
had
something
particular
to
say
and
said
it
there
was
another
thing
i
must
do
for
him
find
a
way
of
informing
sir
lionel
prettily
and
nicely
that
senter
cared
for
him
and
was
very
unhappy
i
flew
out
in
an
instant
and
said
that
i
do
no
such
thing
you
must
said
he
i
wo
said
i
nobody
can
make
me
oh
ca
they
said
he
i
can
then
and
i
mean
to
if
you
refuse
to
do
it
i
shall
believe
you
in
love
with
sir
lionel
yourself
i
do
care
what
you
believe
i
flung
at
him
there
no
shame
in
saying
i
like
sir
lionel
too
well
and
respect
him
too
much
to
have
any
hand
in
making
him
miserable
all
the
rest
of
his
life
do
you
insinuate
that
marrying
my
aunt
would
make
him
miserable
dick
wanted
to
know
i
do
insinuate
i
assert
said
i
and
by
that
time
i
was
in
such
a
temper
and
my
nerves
had
so
gone
to
bits
that
i
did
know
and
cared
less
what
i
was
saying
i
went
on
and
told
dick
exactly
what
i
thought
of
senter
and
that
for
a
loyal
true
sort
of
man
like
sir
lionel
it
would
be
better
to
die
at
once
than
have
her
for
his
wife
for
that
would
be
death
too
only
slow
and
lingering
dick
was
white
with
fury
but
i
hardly
noticed
then
for
i
was
seeing
red
if
you
call
her
deceitful
what
are
you
he
sputtered
i
neither
here
nor
there
said
i
certainly
you
wo
be
here
long
or
where
pendragon
is
said
he
i
would
marry
you
now
if
you
have
me
you
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
adventuress
and
you
a
blackmailer
i
mentioned
because
i
gone
back
to
primitive
passions
like
eve
or
a
brittany
fishwife
that
a
lie
he
answered
politely
because
blackmailers
only
threaten
i
going
to
perform
it
all
up
with
you
i
do
care
for
myself
said
i
but
as
you
know
that
was
only
partly
true
then
for
a
minute
dick
seemed
to
repent
no
good
losing
our
tempers
like
this
he
said
take
back
your
insults
to
my
aunt
who
is
the
best
pal
i
ever
had
though
that
not
saying
much
and
speak
a
good
word
for
her
to
sir
lionel
whom
she
really
loves
and
i
let
you
off
i
have
my
tongue
cut
out
first
i
answered
is
that
your
last
word
he
persisted
yes
said
i
very
well
then
said
he
you
be
sorrier
for
this
than
you
ever
were
for
anything
in
your
life
and
he
stamped
away
leaving
me
alone
i
flew
up
to
my
room
because
i
was
going
to
run
the
risk
of
his
bringing
sir
lionel
in
and
telling
him
everything
before
me
so
here
i
am
and
that
all
except
that
emily
has
come
to
my
door
to
say
her
brother
wants
to
know
if
i
can
be
ready
to
start
in
twenty
minutes
we
back
in
our
rooms
at
the
county
hotel
and
i
am
dazed
with
the
mystery
of
what
is
going
on
i
ready
in
twenty
minutes
and
all
the
automobiles
that
brought
us
yesterday
were
waiting
to
take
us
away
again
when
i
came
down
norton
and
senter
were
in
our
car
sir
lionel
cool
but
polite
prepared
to
help
me
in
standing
by
he
has
great
control
over
his
features
but
i
did
think
if
he
had
heard
dick
story
and
intended
to
shed
me
at
the
nearest
railway
station
not
to
make
a
scandal
at
bamborough
he
could
be
looking
as
unmoved
as
that
no
dick
was
in
sight
naturally
i
did
ask
for
him
but
perhaps
my
eye
moved
wildly
round
for
senter
read
its
question
and
answered
it
in
a
voice
like
insufficiently
sweetened
lemonade
your
dick
dear
child
has
had
another
urgent
summons
to
his
side
and
wo
be
with
us
his
last
words
were
that
you
would
understand
so
i
suppose
he
explained
more
to
you
than
to
me
but
you
are
privileged
i
could
have
boxed
her
ears
emily
went
on
in
her
fussy
way
to
make
things
clear
to
my
intellect
by
adding
that
our
host
had
kindly
sent
mr
burden
to
the
nearest
railway
station
in
his
own
fastest
motor
as
it
seemed
he
had
just
time
to
catch
a
train
leaving
almost
immediately
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
all
and
do
now
whether
a
telegram
from
the
invalid
mother
did
really
come
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
me
like
abraham
ram
that
caught
in
the
bushes
at
the
last
minute
or
whether
this
sudden
dash
to
scotland
is
a
plot
or
whether
he
is
going
really
but
means
to
stop
and
spy
on
me
disguised
as
a
chauffeur
or
a
performing
bear
or
i
ca
guess
all
i
do
know
is
that
so
far
sir
lionel
manner

senter
which
she
is
to
put
into
sir
hand
at
an
appropriate
moment
he
may
seem
altered
at
dinner
to
which
i
must
go
down
soon
or
he
may
send
for
me
and
have
it
out
during
the
evening
i
add
a
line
before
we
get
off
morning
we
just
going
he
seems
the
same
as
ever
i
lost
in
it
i
post
this
downstairs
please
write
at
once
to
graylees
for
if
i
am
sent
away
before
i
ask

your
audrie

her

b
you
might
have
told
me
what
was
up
is
your

anxious
and
puzzled

mother
not
you
will
know
everything
or
day
after
dick
xxxix
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
hotel
beloved
one
situation
unchanged
i
know
now
how
you
felt
when
you
had
nervous
prostration
however
i
not
going
to
have
it
so
worry
if
i
had
been
in
a
state
of
mind
to
enjoy
it
fully
this
would
have
been
a
wonderful
day
but
i
do
suppose
damocles
enjoyed
himself
much
even
if
they
brought
him
delicious
things
to
eat
and
drink
and
rich
jewels
and
the
kind
of
cigarettes
he
always
longed
for
yet
never
could
afford
to
buy
knowing
that
any
instant
it
might
be
the
hair
time
to
break
i
do
believe
he
could
have
done
justice
to
beautiful
durham
cathedral
and
the
famous
bridge
or
splendid
richmond
castle
on
its
height
above
the
swale
or
the
exhilarating
north
road
or
charming
ripon
or
even
the
exquisite
almost
beauty
of
ruined
fountains
abbey
by
the
little
river
that
sings
its
dirge
in
music
sweeter
than
harp
or
violin
no
he
could
have
put
his
soul
into
his
eyes
for
them
and
i
did
i
was
almost
sorry
that
we
were
to
go
on
and
see
harrogate
and
the
strid
and
bolton
abbey
because
in
my
restlessness
i
did
feel
intelligent
enough
to
appreciate
anything
i
could
only
be
dully
thankful
that
the
sword
had
pierced
me
yet
but
i
wanted
to
be
alone
and
shut
my
eyes
and
not
have
to
talk
especially
to
norton
illustration
exquisite
beauty
of
ruined
fountains
dimly
i
realized
that
harrogate
seemed
a
very
pretty
place
where
it
might
be
amusing
to
stay
and
take
baths
and
nice
walks
and
listen
to
music
and
my
bodily
eyes
saw
well
enough
how
lovely
was
the
way
through
niddersdale
and
ilkley
to
pately
bridge
where
we
had
to
get
out
and
walk
through
enchanted
woods
to
the
foaming
cauldron
of
the
strid
the
water
swollen
by
rain
raced
over
its
rocks
below
the
crags
of
the
tragic
jump
like
a
white
horse
running
away
mad
with
unreasoning
terror
nevertheless
my
bodily
eyes
were
only
glass
windows
which
my
spirit
had
deserted
it
left
them
blank
still
at
bolton
abbey
which
is
poetically
beautiful
though
not
as
lovable
as
fountains
on
up
the
great
brown
hill
of
barden
moor
through
skipton
where
in
the
castle
legend
says
fair
rosamond
lived
until
haworth
there
before
we
came
to
the
steep
straight
hill
leading
up
to
the
bleak
and
huddled
townlet
bitten
out
of
the
moor
my
spirit
rushed
to
the
windows
the
voices
of
charlotte
brontë
and
her
sister
emily
called
it
back
and
it
obeyed
at
a
word
though
all
the
beauty
of
wooded
hills
and
fleeting
streams
had
vanished
as
if
frightened
by
the
cold
relentless
winds
of
the
high
moorland
rain
had
begun
to
fall
the
sky
was
leaden
the
sharp
hill
muddy
everything
seemed
to
combine
in
giving
an
effect
of
grimness
as
the
car
forged
steadily
up
up
toward
the
poor
home
the
brontës
loved
is
it
a
beautiful
miracle
the
banishing
of
black
darkness
by
the
clear
light
of
genius
it
was
that
light
which
had
lured
us
away
from
all
the
charms
of
nature
to
a
region
of
ugliness
even
of
squalor
the
brontës
had
lived
there
they
had
pined
for
haworth
when
away
emily
had
written
about
the
spot
barren
hills
where
winter
howls
and
driving
rain
they
had
thought
there
worked
there
the
wondrous
sisters
they
had
illuminated
the
mean
place
and
made
it
a
lodestar
for
the
world
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
which
was
almost
like
reaching
a
ceiling
after
climbing
the
side
of
a
hideous
wall
i
forgot
my
own
troubles
in
thinking
of
the
brontës
tragedy
of
poverty
disappointment
and
death
we
were
in
a
poor
street
of
a
peculiarly
depressing
village
and
could
not
even
see
the
moor
that
had
given
the
brontë
girls
inspiration
though
we
knew
it
must
stretch
beyond
even
in
bright
sunshine
there
could
be
no
beauty
in
haworth
but
under
that
leaden
sky
in
the
thick
mist
of
rain
the
poor
stone
houses
lining
the
way
the
sordid
unattractive
shops
were
positively
repellent
all
that
was
not
so
dark
a
gray
as
to
look
black
was
dull
brown
and
not
a
single
had
a
gleam
of
intelligence
for
the
unwelcome
strangers
i
could
imagine
no
merriment
in
haworth
nor
any
sound
of
laughter
yet
the
brontës
were
happy
when
they
were
children
at
least
they
thought
they
were
but
it
would
be
too
tragic
if
children
did
themselves
happy
there
was
the
black
bull
inn
where
wretched
bramwell
brontë
used
to
carouse
poor
weak
fellow
i
never
pitied
him
till
i
saw
that
gloomy
stone
box
which
meant
seeing
life
to
him
there
was
the
museum
where
the
brontë
relics
are
kept
but
we
delayed
going
in
that
we
might
see
the
old
parsonage
first
the
shrine
where
the
preserved
relics
had
once
made
home
oh
mother
the
sadness
of
it
tucked
away
among
the
crowding
tombstones
all
together
among
weeds
and
early
falling
leaves
here
already
it
was
autumn
and
though
i
could
fancy
a
pale
frosty
spring
and
a
white
winter
my
imagination
could
conjure
up
no
richness
of
summer
illustration
foaming
cauldron
of
the
the
gravestones
crowding
the
gray
old
house
in
the
churchyard
pushing
it
back
toward
the
moor
were
thick
as
an
army
on
parade
a
sad
starved
army
where
dying
soldiers
lean
on
each
other
for
support
and
the
parsonage
shadowed
by
dripping
trees
was
plain
and
uncompromising
as
a
sermon
that
warns
you
not
to
love
the
world
or
you
will
spend
eternity
in
hell
but
behind
just
beyond
the
wall
billowed
the
moor
monotonous
yet
majestic
the
scene
that
called
to
emily
and
charlotte
hearts
always
when
they
were
far
away
my
heart
contracted
as
i
thought
of
them
there
and
when
we
walked
back
to
the
village
street
and
been
admitted
to
the
museum
i
was
on
the
point
of
crying
not
for
myself
but
with
the
choked
grief
one
might
have
on
opening
a
box
of
old
letters
from
a
loved
dead
friend
it
is
the
most
intimate
touching
little
jumble
of
pathetic
souvenirs
you
ever
saw
in
a
museum
more
like
treasures
guarded
by
near
relations
than
a
collection
for
public
eyes
to
see
but
that
makes
the
poignant
charm
of
it
i
could
have
sobbed
on
a
pink
print
frock
with
a
cape
such
as
jane
eyre
might
have
worn
at
thornfield
and
on
bits
of
unfinished
needlework
simple
lace
collars
and
sketches
with
which
charlotte
tried
to
brighten
the
walls
of
her
austere
home
there
was
the
poor
dear
wedding
shawl
and
a
little
checked
silk
dress
of
which
sure
she
was
innocently
proud
a
few
fantastic
drawings
of
bramwell
a
letter
or
two
from
the
sisters
and
a
picture
of
the
reverend
carus
wilson
who
was
supposed
to
be
brocklehurst
just
the
rather
handsome
man
you
would
expect
him
to
be
i
think
dear
that
haworth
has
done
me
good
and
helped
me
to
be
brave
again
and
again
i
turned
when
we
left
to
look
back
at
the
church
tower
and
try
to
gather
some
of
the
brontë
courage
before
we
slipped
away
down
many
a
dark
hill
toward
bradford
as
night
gathered
us
in
i
may
need
all
the
courage
that
i
have
borrowed
and
cashed
in
advance
because
suspense
is
worse
than
the
pain
of
any
blow
we
leave
here
early
morning
for
graylees
castle
in
warwickshire
and
the
tour
is
at
an
end
your
audrie
who
loves
and
longs
for
you
xl
audrie
brendon
to
her
mother
of
september
dearest
and
wisest
i
remember
the
first
letter
i
wrote
you
on
july
fourth
about
the
ellaline
business
began
with
expressions
something
like
this
fireworks
roman
candles
rockets
well
my
last
letter
about
the
ellaline
business
begins
with
explosions
too
a
whole
gunpowder
plot
has
exploded
dick
plot
we
got
here
in
the
afternoon
an
uneventful
run
for
sir
lionel
was
always
the
same
cool
but
kind
i
could
believe
dick
had
told
him
anything
graylees
is
a
place
to
be
proud
of
and
you
would
never
know
there
had
been
a
fire
in
the
castle
but
no
injury
was
done
to
the
oldest
part
norton
says
graylees
is
called
the
miniature
warwick
but
it
does
look
a
miniature
anything
it
seems
enormous
there
a
great
hall
with
suits
of
armour
scattered
about
and
weapons
of
all
periods
arranged
in
intricate
patterns
on
the
stone
wall
and
a
gallery
and
quantities
of
grand
old
tudor
and
stuart
furniture
a
haunted
where
a
murdered
bride
walks
each
christmas
eve
beautifully
dressed
there
a
suite
of
rooms
in
which
kings
and
queens
have
occasionally
slept
since
the
time
when
henry
seventh
reigned
there
a
priest
hidie
hole
and
secret
dungeons
under
the
big
where
people
used
to
revel
while
their
prisoners
writhed
and
but
i
have
seen
nearly
all
yet
the
room
allotted
to
me
looks
down
from
its
high
tower
on
to
a
mossy
moat
choked
with
pink
and
white
water
lilies
on
a
stone
terrace
this
side
of
a
sunken
garden
a
peacock
plays
sentinel
with
his
tail
spread
like
a
jewelled
shield
and
against
the
sky
dark
horizontal
branches
of
lebanon
cedars
stretch
like
arms
of
priests
pronouncing
a
blessing
may
the
blessing
rest
upon
this
house
forever
i
hardly
saw
the
country
through
which
we
came
though
it
was
george
eliot
country
and
i
half
expected
something
to
happen
as
soon
as
we
arrived
sir
lionel
perhaps
turning
on
me
at
last
and
saying
icily
i
know
everything
but
do
want
a
scandal
go
quietly
at
once
nothing
of
the
sort
came
to
pass
however
we
had
tea
in
the
great
hall
brought
by
an
old
butler
who
had
known
sir
lionel
when
he
visited
the
uncle
who
left
graylees
to
him
afterward
norton
showed
me
my
room
where
already
a
maid
engaged
for
miss
lethbridge
had
unpacked
most
of
my
things
the
big
luggage
having
arrived
before
us
my
heart
gave
a
jump
when
i
saw
the
drawers
and
big
wardrobes
full
of
finery
but
settled
down
again
when
i
remembered
that
almost
everything
belonged
to
ellaline
and
that
my
legitimate
possessions
could
be
packed
again
in
about
five
minutes
before
the
change
of
friendship
weather
at
chester
i
think
sir
lionel
would
have
wanted
to
take
me
round
his
domain
indoors
and
out
but
no
such
suggestion
was
made
i
was
in
my
room
and
there
i
stayed
but
i
felt
too
restless
to
settle
down
and
write
to
you
i
kept
waiting
for
something
as
you
do
for
a
clock
to
strike
when
you
know
it
is
bound
to
strike
soon
by
and
by
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
i
could
bear
to
wear
one
of
the
grand
ellaline
dresses
so
i
put
on
the
old
black
i
did
look
a
frump
in
it
in
such
a
place
as
graylees
castle
where
everything
ought
to
be
beautiful
and
rich
but
i
did
my
hair
as
nicely
as
i
could
and
from
the
top
of
my
head
to
my
shoulders
i
was
so
bad
i
went
downstairs
at
eight
and
senter
was
already
in
the
great
hall
standing
in
front
of
the
splendid
stone
fireplace
watching
her
rings
sparkle
in
the
light
of
the
wood
fire
and
resting
one
pretty
foot
on
a
paw
of
the
carved
stone
wolf
that
supports
a
ledge
of
the
mantelpiece
just
as
if
it
belonged
to
her
and
she
had
tamed
it
she
glanced
up
when
i
appeared
and
smiled
vaguely
but
did
speak
she
seemed
thoughtful
after
awhile
emily
came
swishing
silkily
senter
began
to
talk
to
her
praising
the
place
and
then
just
before
the
quarter
past
sir
lionel
joined
us
looking
nice
but
tired
senter
gave
him
a
sweet
smile
and
he
smiled
back
he
gave
her
his
arm
in
to
dinner
and
she
did
clever
things
with
her
eyelashes
which
made
her
seem
to
blush
she
wore
a
white
dress
i
not
seen
yet
a
simple
string
of
pearls
round
her
neck
and
quite
a
maidenly
or
bridal
look
i
could
wonder
at
sir
lionel
if
he
admired
her
at
the
which
was
beautiful
with
flowers
lots
of
silver
and
old
crystal
a
picture
against
the
dark
oak
panelling
senter
was
on
his
right
hand
i
on
his
left
his
sister
playing
hostess
this
was
as
usual
but
as
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
own
house
somehow
it
made
senter
seem
of
more
importance
he
and
she
talked
together
a
good
deal
and
she
said
some
witty
things
but
spent
herself
mostly
in
drawing
him
out
he
did
speak
to
me
except
to
deign
a
question
about
my
room
or
ask
whether
i
would
have
a
certain
thing
to
eat
i
felt
a
dreadful
lump
and
worth
about
thirty
cents
as
dad
used
to
say
after
dinner
when
emily
took
us
to
a
charming
all
white
with
an
old
spinet
in
one
corner
sir
lionel
stopped
away
for
a
few
minutes
but
when
he
came
senter
grabbed
him
immediately
she
would
let
him
hear
when
emily
inquired
if
i
could
sing
accompanying
myself
on
the
spinet
but
began
asking
him
eagerly
about
the
library
which
it
seems
is
rather
famous
you
shall
see
it
if
you
like
said
he
oh
may
i
have
a
peep
she
begged
prettily
do
take
me
just
one
peep
so
he
took
her
of
course
and
the
peep
prolonged
itself
indefinitely
i
had
a
sinking
presentiment
that
my
dreadful
with
dick
had
been
in
vain
and
that
after
all
she
would
inveigle
him
into
proposing
to
her
this
very
night
since
i
refused
to
tell
him
that
her
damask
cheek
was
being
preyed
upon
by
love
of
him
she
would
probably
intimate
as
much
herself
and
bury
her
head
between
her
hands
looking
incredibly
sad
and
lovable
sir
lionel
would
be
the
man
to
fight
such
tactics
as
those
i
knew
he
did
would
and
could
love
her
one
little
bit
but
he
would
be
sorry
for
her
and
sacrifice
himself
rather
than
she
should
suffer
for
his
sake
when
he
might
make
her
happy
emily
chatted
to
me
pleasantly
about
the
church
and
the
vicar
at
graylees
and
family
tombs
and
such
cheerful
things
to
which
i
said
yes
and
no
whenever
she
stopped
but
a
cold
perspiration
was
coming
out
on
my
forehead
i
was
just
as
sure
as
that
i
was
alive
that
senter
did
mean
to
leave
the
library
until
sir
lionel
had
made
her
a
present
of
himself
his
books
and
his
castle
probably
my
self
or
astral
body
was
there
hearing
every
word
they
said
anyhow
i
and
i
could
do
nothing
a
or
a
rack
would
have
been
a
pleasant
relief
suddenly
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
quickly
up
to
the
house
who
can
that
be
wondered
norton
it
after
nine
very
likely
it
mr
burden
said
i
the
first
moderately
intelligent
remark
i
made
since
we
were
left
together
she
agreed
with
me
that
this
was
probable
but
when
fifteen
twenty
forty
minutes
passed
by
the
clock
and
dick
did
not
appear
she
changed
her
mind
it
must
have
been
someone
to
see
sir
lionel
she
thought
on
business
that
would
wait
i
was
not
convinced
of
this
and
longed
for
her
to
ring
and
ask
a
footman
who
had
come
but
i
could
very
well
suggest
it
the
house
did
sound
so
silent
that
my
ears
rang
as
they
do
when
one
listens
to
a
shell
ten
a
louis
quatorze
clock
chimed
hardly
had
it
got
the
last
two
strokes
out
of
its
mouth
when
sir
lionel
opened
the
door
he
was
pale
in
that
frightening
way
that
tanned
skins
do
turn
pale
and
he
did
seem
to
see
his
sister
he
looked
straight
past
her
at
me
and
his
eyes
shone
i
want
very
much
to
speak
to
you
he
said
his
voice
shook
ever
so
slightly
as
if
he
were
going
into
a
battle
where
he
knew
he
would
be
killed
and
felt
solemn
about
it
but
otherwise
was
rather
pleased
than
not
then
i
knew
my
time
had
come
i
almost
looked
for
the
steps
of
the
guillotine
but
i
was
suddenly
too
blind
to
see
them
if
they
had
been
under
my
nose
very
well
i
said
and
got
up
from
my
chair
oh
exclaimed
emily
do
go
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
ellaline
which
you
like
to
say
to
her
alone
let
me
go
i
am
getting
sleepy
and
was
just
thinking
about
bed
perhaps
i
might
say
to
you
both
dear
answered
sir
lionel
i
had
never
heard
him
call
her
that
before
say
to
senter
for
me
went
on
emily
to
us
both
yes
said
sir
lionel
but
i
do
think
he
had
heard
norton
swished
silkily
out
the
door
shut
i
braced
myself
and
looked
up
at
him
his
eyes
were
on
my
face
and
they
were
full
of
light
i
supposed
it
must
be
righteous
anger
but
it
was
a
beautiful
look
too
good
to
waste
on
such
a
passion
even
a
righteous
form
of
it
you
poor
child
he
said
in
a
low
voice
standing
quite
near
me
you
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
i
started
as
if
he
had
shot
me
that
way
of
beginning
was
so
different
from
anything
i
had
expected
do
you
mean
i
stammered
that
i
always
knew
you
were
brave
but
that
you
a
hundred
times
braver
than
i
thought
you
dick
has
come
back
he
has
brought
with
him
a
girl
and
a
man
from
scotland
bride
and
groom
all
the
strength
went
out
of
me
i
felt
as
if
my
body
had
turned
to
liquid
and
left
only
my
brain
burning
and
my
heart
throbbing
but
i
did
fall
i
fancy
i
caught
the
back
of
a
tall
chair
and
held
on
for
dear
life
ellaline
i
murmured
yes
ellaline
he
said
thank
god
you
are
not
ellaline
thank
god
i
echoed
in
weak
wonder
i
thank
god
yes
because
it
was
killing
me
to
believe
that
you
were
ellaline
to
believe
you
false
and
frivolous
and
a
flirt
just
because
of
the
blood
i
thought
you
had
in
your
veins
and
i
exaggerated
everything
you
did
till
i
made
a
mountain
out
of
each
fancied
fault
that
fellow
burden
brought
ellaline
here
just
married
to
her
frenchman
because
he
wanted
to
ruin
you
he
told
me
with
pride
how
ferretted
out
the
whole
secret
traced
you
to
your
address
in
versailles
learned
your
real
name
told
everything
in
fact
except
that
he
been
blackmailing
you
forcing
you
for
your
friend
sake
to
actions
you
hated
he
did
tell
me
that
part
naturally
but
there
was
no
need
because
i
guessed
what
what
have
you
done
to
him
the
words
came
limping
because
of
the
look
in
his
eyes
which
shot
forth
a
sword
oh
unluckily
it
under
my
own
roof
so
i
could
do
no
more
than
bid
him
clear
out
if
he
did
want
to
be
kicked
out
gone
i
whispered
yes
gone
and
as
senter
very
loyal
to
her
nephew
she
prefers
to
leave
with
him
though
she
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
plottings
did
even
know
and
i
asked
her
to
stay
she
insists
on
going
when
he
does
i
sorry
but
it
ca
be
helped
i
can
not
think
of
her
now
ellaline
i
began
faintly
but
he
cut
me
short
with
a
kind
of
generous
impatience
yes
yes
you
shall
see
her
she
wants
to
see
you
now
that
she
understands
but
understands
why
you
see
that
little
beast
dick
burden
whose
mother
staying
near
where
ellaline
was
in
scotland
went
there
straight
from
bamborough
and
put
the
girl
up
to
believe
you
been
playing
her
false
prejudicing
me
against
her
interests
trying
to
keep
for
yourself
things
that
ought
to
be
hers
so
apparently
she
worked
herself
into
a
hysterical
state
must
have
or
she
would
have
believed
him
against
you
and
the
instant
she
was
married
to
her
frenchman
who
come
to
claim
her
all
three
dashed
off
here
to
you
as
that
cad
burden
explained
to
me
i
could
understand
what
they
were
all
driving
at
just
at
first
but
i
saw
that
the
girl
was
the
living
image
of
her
mother
consequently
the
thing
did
need
as
much
explaining
in
any
way
as
it
might
otherwise
she
was
horribly
afraid
you
would
let
her
marry
him
i
broke
in
getting
breath
and
voice
back
at
last
so
she
said
oh
when
she
knew
burden
had
lied
to
her
about
you
she
repented
her
disloyalty
and
told
me
how
you
hated
the
whole
thing
i
do
wonder
she
thought
me
a
brute
never
writing
never
seeming
to
care
whether
she
was
alive
or
dead
i
see
now
i
was
a
brute
but
you
who
shown
me
that
not
she
however
she
will
reap
the
benefit
i
daresay
three
months
ago
i
should
have
growled
over
such
a
marriage
felt
inclined
to
wash
my
hands
of
the
girl
perhaps
but
now
now
delighted
to
have
her
married
and
my
hands
that
sounds
callous
but
i
ca
help
it
it
true
the
frenchman
seems
a
gentleman
and
fond
of
her
trust
ellaline
de
nesville
daughter
to
make
men
fall
in
love
and
i
wish
them
both
joy
but
but
if
he
poor
i
dared
to
question
oh
that
be
all
right
i
so
thankful
for
the
way
everything
has
turned
out
i
give
her
half
my
fortune
that
would
be
asinine
of
course
but
i
shall
settle
a
thousand
a
year
on
her
for
life
and
give
her
a
wedding
present
of
a
cheque
for
twenty
thousand
i
think
should
you
say
that
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
them
they
ought
to
be
distracted
with
joy
i
said
though
deep
in
my
heart
i
knew
that
ellaline
is
never
likely
to
be
satisfied
with
anything
done
for
her
she
always
feels
it
might
have
been
a
little
more
but
i
went
on
maybe
it
selfish
to
think
of
myself
now
but
i
ca
help
it
for
a
moment
i
have
been
so
ashamed
so
humiliated
i
could
hardly
bear
and
yet
i
know
you
wo
you
ca
see
that
there
any
excuse
did
i
tell
you
that
i
thought
you
very
brave
he
asked
looking
at
me
more
kindly
than
i
deserved
yes
and
i
was
brave
i
took
credit
to
myself
but
brave
people
can
be
wicked
i
have
hated
myself
knowing
how
you
hate
me
when
i
do
hate
you
he
said
the
question
is
do
you
hate
me
i
gasped
because
i
was
so
far
from
hating
him
and
suddenly
i
was
afraid
he
might
suspect
exactly
far
no
said
i
but
then
that
is
different
i
never
had
any
reason
to
hate
you
did
ellaline
warn
you
i
was
a
regular
dragon
i
could
help
laughing
because
that
had
been
our
very
name
for
him
oh
well
she
i
began
to
apologize
you
need
be
afraid
to
confess
said
he
in
the
exuberance
of
her
relief
at
finding
all
well
and
not
only
being
forgiven
but
petted
she
told
me
what
a
different
man
i
was
from
the
murderous
image
in
her
mind
and
that
she
saw
now
you
were
right
about
me
is
it
possible
you
defended
me
to
her
but
of
course
i
said
in
spite
of
all
the
injustice
i
did
you
and
showed
that
i
did
you
i
always
felt
myself
to
blame
and
yet
yet
it
hurt
me
when
i
saw
you
disapproved
of
me
since
chester
it
was
that
ring
stuck
in
my
throat
said
he
you
knew
i
stammered
turning
red
saw
it
in
a
shop
window
and
now
i
know
why
you
did
it
why
you
did
everything
i
think
heavens
what
good
it
would
have
done
me
to
kick
that
little
beast
burden
all
around
the
park
there
would
have
been
anything
left
of
him
if
you
had
i
giggled
beginning
to
feel
hysterical
oh
i
am
glad
he
gone
though
i
shall
be
going
myself
of
course
but
no
he
said
no
that
must
not
be
i
ellaline
wants
you
had
i
better
see
her
now
i
asked
meekly
not
yet
tell
me
did
that
cad
try
you
too
far
at
bamborough
and
did
you
defy
him
i
nodded
yes
what
did
he
do
he
did
do
anything
he
wanted
me
to
promise
something
to
marry
him
at
once
sir
lionel
was
looking
dangerous
it
was
anything
about
me
i
ca
tell
you
because
it
concerns
someone
else
please
do
ask
me
i
wo
if
it
concerns
someone
else
not
yourself
i
do
care
yes
i
do
though
did
it
concern
me
can
you
answer
me
that
i
can
answer
so
far
if
you
do
press
me
further
it
did
concern
you
i
would
not
sacrifice
you
to
but
i
do
want
to
go
on
please
you
sha
that
enough
you
sacrificed
yourself
rather
than
sacrifice
me
you
i
sinned
enough
against
you
you
gave
me
back
my
youth
i
do
you
know
i
love
you
worship
you
adore
you
yes
said
mother
his
lips
said
it
and
his
dear
dear
eyes
i
looked
up
to
them
and
mine
overflowed
and
he
needed
no
other
answer
for
he
took
me
in
his
arms
i
did
know
people
could
be
so
happy
i
could
have
died
in
that
moment
only
i
would
much
much
rather
live
in
a
few
minutes
we
told
each
other
heaps
of
things
about
the
way
we
felt
and
the
way
we
felt
and
compared
notes
and
it
was
heavenly
he
bought
back
the
darling
ring
in
chester
and
now
he
put
it
on
my
finger
again
and
i
sure
dearest
that
you
wo
mind
our
being
engaged
he
says
he
has
adored
me
ever
since
the
first
day
and
will
to
the
last
then
on
into
the
next
world
because
there
ca
be
a
next
world
that
wo
be
full
of
his
love
for
me
and
i
adore
him
ah
i
adore
him
and
you
will
come
here
to
live
with
us
in
this
beautiful
old
castle
where
like
the
prince
and
princess
of
the
fairy
stories
we
will
be
happy
ever
after
i
have
seen
ellaline
and
she
is
well
and
hugged
me
a
great
deal
her
honoré
is
really
very
handsome
but
i
ca
write
about
them
now
though
they
have
been
so
important
in
my
life
and
without
them
there
would
have
been
no
life
worth
speaking
of
emily
and
lionel
i
am
to
call
him
that
now
will
take
me
to
you
and
everything
shall
be
arranged
as
you
wish
dear
little
wise
mother
i
wonder
if
you
ever
thought
it
might
end
like
this
i
did
but
he
is
the
most
glorious
man
who
ever
happened
only
he
did
happen
all
the
rest
of
the
world
not
counting
you
happened
he
just
had
to
be
your
loving
perfectly
happy
audrie
