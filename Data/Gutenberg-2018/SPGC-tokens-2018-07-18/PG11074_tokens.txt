the
damned
algernon
blackwood
chapter
i
i
over
forty
frances
and
rather
set
in
my
ways
i
said
ready
to
yield
if
she
insisted
that
our
going
together
on
the
visit
involved
her
happiness
my
work
is
rather
heavy
just
now
too
as
you
know
the
question
is
could
i
work
there
with
a
lot
of
unassorted
people
in
the
house
mabel
does
mention
any
other
people
bill
was
my
rejoinder
i
gather
she
alone
as
well
as
lonely
by
the
way
she
looked
sideways
out
of
the
window
at
nothing
it
was
obvious
she
was
disappointed
but
to
my
surprise
she
did
not
urge
the
point
and
as
i
glanced
at
franklyn
invitation
lying
upon
her
sloping
lap
the
neat
childish
handwriting
conjured
up
a
mental
picture
of
the
banker
widow
with
her
timid
insignificant
personality
her
pale
grey
eyes
and
her
expression
as
of
a
backward
child
i
thought
too
of
the
roomy
country
mansion
her
late
husband
had
altered
to
suit
his
particular
needs
and
of
my
visit
to
it
a
few
years
ago
when
its
barren
spaciousness
suggested
a
wing
of
kensington
museum
fitted
up
temporarily
as
a
place
to
eat
and
sleep
in
comparing
it
mentally
with
the
poky
chelsea
flat
where
i
and
my
sister
kept
impecunious
house
i
realized
other
points
as
well
unworthy
details
flashed
across
me
to
entice
the
fine
library
the
organ
the
quiet
i
should
have
perfect
service
the
delicious
cup
of
early
tea
and
hot
baths
at
any
moment
of
the
day
without
a
geyser
it
a
longish
visit
a
month
is
it
i
hedged
smiling
at
the
details
that
seduced
me
and
ashamed
of
my
man
selfishness
yet
knowing
that
frances
expected
it
of
me
there
are
points
about
it
i
admit
if
you
set
on
my
going
with
you
i
could
manage
it
all
right
i
spoke
at
length
in
this
way
because
my
sister
made
no
answer
i
saw
her
tired
eyes
gazing
into
the
dreariness
of
oakley
street
and
felt
a
pang
strike
through
me
after
a
pause
in
which
again
she
said
no
word
i
added
so
when
you
write
the
letter
you
might
hint
perhaps
that
i
usually
work
all
the
morning
and
er
am
not
a
very
lively
visitor
then
she
understand
you
see
and
i
to
return
to
my
diminutive
study
where
i
was
slaving
just
then
at
an
absorbing
article
on
comparative
aesthetic
values
in
the
blind
and
deaf
but
frances
did
not
move
she
kept
her
grey
eyes
upon
oakley
street
where
the
evening
mist
from
the
river
drew
mournful
perspectives
into
view
it
was
late
october
we
heard
the
omnibuses
thundering
across
the
bridge
the
monotony
of
that
broad
characterless
street
seemed
more
than
usually
depressing
even
in
june
sunshine
it
was
dead
but
with
autumn
its
melancholy
soaked
into
every
house
between
king
road
and
the
embankment
it
washed
thought
into
the
past
instead
of
inviting
it
hopefully
towards
the
future
for
me
its
easy
width
was
an
avenue
through
which
nameless
slums
across
the
river
sent
creeping
messages
of
depression
and
i
always
regarded
it
as
winter
main
entrance
into
london
fog
slush
gloom
trooped
down
it
every
november
waving
their
forbidding
banners
till
march
came
to
rout
them
its
one
claim
upon
my
love
was
that
the
south
wind
swept
sometimes
unobstructed
up
it
soft
with
suggestions
of
the
sea
these
lugubrious
thoughts
i
naturally
kept
to
myself
though
i
never
ceased
to
regret
the
little
flat
whose
cheapness
had
seduced
us
now
as
i
watched
my
sister
impassive
face
i
realized
that
perhaps
she
too
felt
as
i
felt
yet
brave
woman
without
betraying
it
and
look
here
fanny
i
said
putting
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
as
i
crossed
the
room
it
would
be
the
very
thing
for
you
you
worn
out
with
catering
and
housekeeping
mabel
is
your
oldest
friend
besides
and
you
hardly
seen
her
since
he
died
she
been
abroad
for
a
year
bill
and
only
just
came
back
my
sister
interposed
she
came
back
rather
unexpectedly
though
i
never
thought
she
would
go
there
to
live
she
stopped
abruptly
clearly
she
was
only
speaking
half
her
mind
probably
she
went
on
mabel
wants
to
pick
up
old
links
again
naturally
i
put
in
yourself
chief
among
them
the
veiled
reference
to
the
house
i
let
pass
it
involved
discussing
the
dead
man
for
one
thing
i
feel
i
ought
to
go
anyhow
she
resumed
and
of
course
it
would
be
jollier
if
you
came
too
you
get
in
such
a
muddle
here
by
yourself
and
eat
wrong
things
and
forget
to
air
the
rooms
and
oh
everything
she
looked
up
laughing
only
she
added
there
the
british
museum
but
there
a
big
library
there
i
answered
and
all
the
books
of
reference
i
could
possibly
want
it
was
of
you
i
was
thinking
you
could
take
up
your
painting
again
you
always
sell
half
of
what
you
paint
it
would
be
a
splendid
rest
too
and
sussex
is
a
jolly
country
to
walk
in
by
all
means
fanny
i
advise
our
eyes
met
as
i
stammered
in
my
attempts
to
avoid
expressing
the
thought
that
hid
in
both
our
minds
my
sister
had
a
weakness
for
dabbling
in
the
various
new
theories
of
the
day
and
mabel
who
before
her
marriage
had
belonged
to
foolish
societies
for
investigating
the
future
life
to
the
neglect
of
the
present
one
had
fostered
this
undesirable
tendency
her
amiable
impressionable
temperament
was
open
to
every
psychic
wind
that
blew
i
deplored
detested
the
whole
business
but
even
more
than
this
i
abhorred
the
later
influence
that
franklyn
had
steeped
his
wife
in
capturing
her
body
and
soul
in
his
somber
doctrines
i
had
dreaded
lest
my
sister
also
might
be
caught
now
that
she
is
alone
again
i
stopped
short
our
eyes
now
made
pretence
impossible
for
the
truth
had
slipped
out
inevitably
stupidly
although
unexpressed
in
definite
language
we
laughed
turning
our
faces
a
moment
to
look
at
other
things
in
the
room
frances
picked
up
a
book
and
examined
its
cover
as
though
she
had
made
an
important
discovery
while
i
took
my
case
out
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
did
not
want
to
smoke
we
left
the
matter
there
i
went
out
of
the
room
before
further
explanation
could
cause
tension
disagreements
grow
into
discord
from
such
tiny
things
wrong
adjectives
or
a
chance
inflection
of
the
voice
frances
had
a
right
to
her
views
of
life
as
much
as
i
had
at
least
i
reflected
comfortably
we
had
separated
upon
an
agreement
this
time
recognized
mutually
though
not
actually
stated
and
this
point
of
meeting
was
oddly
enough
our
way
of
regarding
some
one
who
was
dead
for
we
had
both
disliked
the
husband
with
a
great
dislike
and
during
his
three
years
married
life
had
only
been
to
the
house
once
for
a
weekend
visit
arriving
late
on
saturday
we
had
left
after
an
early
breakfast
on
monday
morning
ascribing
my
sister
dislike
to
a
natural
jealousy
at
losing
her
old
friend
i
said
merely
that
he
displeased
me
yet
we
both
knew
that
the
real
emotion
lay
much
deeper
frances
loyal
honorable
creature
had
kept
silence
and
beyond
saying
that
house
and
grounds
he
altered
one
and
laid
out
the
other
distressed
her
as
an
expression
of
his
personality
somehow
was
the
word
she
used
no
further
explanation
had
passed
her
lips
our
dislike
of
his
personality
was
easily
accounted
for
up
to
a
point
since
both
of
us
shared
the
artist
point
of
view
that
a
creed
cut
to
measure
and
carefully
dried
was
an
ugly
thing
and
that
a
dogma
to
which
believers
must
subscribe
or
perish
everlastingly
was
a
barbarism
resting
upon
cruelty
but
while
my
own
dislike
was
purely
due
to
an
abstract
worship
of
beauty
my
sister
had
another
twist
in
it
for
with
her
new
tendencies
she
believed
that
all
religions
were
an
aspect
of
truth
and
that
no
one
even
the
lowest
wretch
could
escape
heaven
in
the
long
run
samuel
franklyn
the
rich
banker
was
a
man
universally
respected
and
admired
and
the
marriage
though
mabel
was
fifteen
years
his
junior
won
general
applause
his
bride
was
an
heiress
in
her
own
right
breweries
and
the
story
of
her
conversion
at
a
revivalist
meeting
where
samuel
franklyn
had
spoken
fervidly
of
heaven
and
terrifyingly
of
sin
hell
and
damnation
even
contained
a
touch
of
genuine
romance
she
was
a
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
his
detailed
eloquence
had
frightened
her
into
heaven
salvation
came
in
the
nick
of
time
his
words
had
plucked
her
from
the
edge
of
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
she
regarded
him
as
a
hero
sighed
her
relief
upon
his
saintly
shoulder
and
accepted
the
peace
he
offered
her
with
a
grateful
resignation
for
her
husband
was
a
religious
man
who
successfully
combined
great
riches
with
the
glamour
of
winning
souls
he
was
a
portly
figure
though
tall
with
masterful
big
hands
his
fingers
rather
thick
and
red
and
his
dignity
that
just
escaped
being
pompous
held
in
it
something
that
was
implacable
a
convinced
assurance
almost
remorseless
gleamed
in
his
eyes
when
he
preached
especially
and
his
threats
of
hell
fire
must
have
scared
souls
stronger
than
the
timid
receptive
mabel
whom
he
married
he
clad
himself
in
long
hat
buttoned
unevenly
big
square
boots
and
trousers
that
invariably
bagged
at
the
knee
and
were
a
little
short
he
wore
low
collars
spats
occasionally
and
a
tall
black
hat
that
was
not
of
silk
his
voice
was
alternately
hard
and
unctuous
and
he
regarded
theaters
ballrooms
and
racecourses
as
the
vestibule
of
that
brimstone
lake
of
whose
geography
he
was
as
positive
as
of
his
great
banking
offices
in
the
city
a
philanthropist
up
to
the
hilt
however
no
one
ever
doubted
his
complete
sincerity
his
convictions
were
ingrained
his
faith
borne
out
by
his
life
as
witness
his
name
upon
so
many
admirable
societies
as
treasurer
patron
or
heading
the
donation
list
he
bulked
large
in
the
world
of
doing
good
a
broad
and
stately
stone
in
the
rampart
against
evil
and
his
heart
was
genuinely
kind
and
soft
for
others
who
believed
as
he
did
yet
in
spite
of
this
true
sympathy
with
suffering
and
his
desire
to
help
he
was
narrow
as
a
telegraph
wire
and
unbending
as
a
church
pillar
he
was
intensely
selfish
intolerant
as
an
officer
of
the
inquisition
his
bourgeois
soul
constructed
a
revolting
scheme
of
heaven
that
was
reproduced
in
miniature
in
all
he
did
and
planned
faith
was
the
sine
qua
non
of
salvation
and
by
faith
he
meant
belief
in
his
own
particular
view
of
things
which
faith
except
every
one
do
keep
whole
and
undefiled
without
doubt
he
shall
perish
everlastingly
all
the
world
but
his
own
small
exclusive
sect
must
be
damned
eternally
a
pity
but
alas
inevitable
he
was
right
yet
he
prayed
without
ceasing
and
gave
heavily
to
the
poor
the
only
thing
he
could
not
give
being
big
ideas
to
his
provincial
and
suburban
deity
pettier
than
an
insect
and
more
obstinate
than
a
mule
he
had
also
the
superior
sleek
humility
of
a
chosen
one
he
was
churchwarden
too
he
read
the
lesson
in
a
place
of
worship
either
chilly
or
overheated
where
neither
organ
vestments
nor
lighted
candles
were
permitted
but
where
the
odor
of
on
the
boys
heads
in
the
back
rows
pervaded
the
entire
building
this
portrait
of
the
banker
who
accumulated
riches
both
on
earth
and
in
heaven
may
possibly
be
overdrawn
however
because
frances
and
i
were
artistic
temperaments
that
viewed
the
type
with
a
dislike
and
distrust
amounting
to
contempt
the
majority
considered
samuel
franklyn
a
worthy
man
and
a
good
citizen
the
majority
doubtless
held
the
saner
view
a
few
years
more
and
he
certainly
would
have
been
made
a
baronet
he
relieved
much
suffering
in
the
world
as
assuredly
as
he
caused
many
souls
the
agonies
of
torturing
fear
by
his
emphasis
upon
damnation
had
there
been
one
point
of
beauty
in
him
we
might
have
been
more
lenient
only
we
found
it
not
and
i
admit
took
little
pains
to
search
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
dour
forgiveness
with
which
he
heard
our
excuses
for
missing
morning
prayers
that
sunday
morning
of
our
single
visit
to
the
towers
my
sister
learned
that
a
change
was
made
soon
afterwards
prayers
being
conducted
after
breakfast
instead
of
before
the
towers
stood
solemnly
upon
a
sussex
hill
amid
modern
grounds
but
the
house
can
not
better
be
described
it
would
be
so
wearisome
for
one
thing
than
by
saying
that
it
was
a
cross
between
an
overgrown
pretentious
norwood
villa
and
one
of
those
saturnine
institutes
for
cripples
the
train
passes
as
it
slinks
ashamed
through
south
london
into
surrey
it
was
wealthily
furnished
and
at
first
sight
imposing
but
on
closer
acquaintance
revealed
a
meager
personality
barren
and
austere
one
looked
for
rules
and
regulations
on
the
walls
all
signed
by
order
the
place
was
a
prison
that
shut
out
the
world
there
was
of
course
no
no
no
room
for
play
of
any
kind
and
the
great
hall
at
the
back
once
a
chapel
which
might
have
been
used
for
dancing
theatricals
or
other
innocent
amusements
was
consecrated
in
his
day
to
meetings
of
various
kinds
chiefly
brigades
temperance
or
missionary
societies
there
was
a
harmonium
at
one
end
on
the
level
floor
a
raised
dais
or
platform
at
the
other
and
a
gallery
above
for
the
servants
gardeners
and
coachmen
it
was
heated
with
pipes
and
hung
with
pictures
though
these
latter
were
soon
removed
and
stored
out
of
sight
in
the
attics
as
being
too
unspiritual
in
polished
shiny
wood
it
was
a
representation
in
miniature
of
that
poky
exclusive
heaven
he
took
about
with
him
externalizing
it
in
all
he
did
and
planned
even
in
the
grounds
about
the
house
changes
in
the
towers
frances
told
me
had
been
made
during
year
of
widowhood
abroad
an
organ
put
into
the
big
hall
the
library
made
livable
and
when
it
was
permissible
to
suppose
she
had
found
her
soul
again
and
returned
to
her
normal
healthy
views
of
life
which
included
enjoyment
and
play
literature
music
and
the
arts
without
however
a
touch
of
that
trivial
thoughtlessness
usually
termed
worldliness
franklyn
as
i
remembered
her
was
a
quiet
little
woman
shallow
perhaps
and
easily
influenced
but
sincere
as
a
dog
and
thorough
in
her
faithful
friendship
her
tastes
at
heart
were
catholic
and
that
heart
was
simple
and
unimaginative
that
she
took
up
with
the
various
movements
of
the
day
was
sign
merely
that
she
was
searching
in
her
limited
way
for
a
belief
that
should
bring
her
peace
she
was
in
fact
a
very
ordinary
woman
her
caliber
a
little
less
than
that
of
frances
i
knew
they
used
to
discuss
all
kinds
of
theories
together
but
as
these
discussions
never
resulted
in
action
i
had
come
to
regard
her
as
harmless
still
i
was
not
sorry
when
she
married
and
i
did
not
welcome
now
a
renewal
of
the
former
intimacy
the
philanthropist
she
had
given
no
children
or
she
would
have
made
a
good
and
sensible
mother
no
doubt
she
would
marry
again
mabel
mentions
that
she
been
alone
at
the
towers
since
the
end
of
august
frances
told
me
at
teatime
and
i
sure
she
feels
out
of
it
and
lonely
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
go
besides
i
always
liked
her
i
agreed
i
had
recovered
from
my
attack
of
selfishness
i
expressed
my
pleasure
you
written
to
accept
i
said
half
statement
and
half
question
frances
nodded
i
thanked
for
you
she
added
quietly
explaining
that
you
were
not
free
at
the
moment
but
that
later
if
not
inconvenient
you
might
come
down
for
a
bit
and
join
me
i
stared
frances
sometimes
had
this
independent
way
of
deciding
things
i
was
convicted
and
punished
into
the
bargain
of
course
there
followed
argument
and
explanation
as
between
brother
and
sister
who
were
affectionate
but
the
recording
of
our
talk
could
be
of
little
interest
it
was
arranged
thus
frances
and
i
both
satisfied
two
days
later
she
departed
for
the
towers
leaving
me
alone
in
the
flat
with
everything
planned
for
my
comfort
and
good
behavior
she
was
rather
a
tyrant
in
her
quiet
way
and
her
last
words
as
i
saw
her
off
from
charing
cross
rang
in
my
head
for
a
long
time
after
she
was
gone
i
write
and
let
you
know
bill
eat
properly
mind
and
let
me
know
if
anything
goes
wrong
she
waved
her
small
gloved
hand
nodded
her
head
till
the
feather
brushed
the
window
and
was
gone
chapter
ii
after
the
note
announcing
her
safe
arrival
a
week
of
silence
passed
and
then
a
letter
came
there
were
various
suggestions
for
my
welfare
and
the
rest
was
the
usual
rambling
information
and
description
frances
loved
generously
and
we
are
quite
alone
she
went
on
in
her
enormous
handwriting
that
seemed
such
a
waste
of
space
and
labor
though
some
others
are
coming
presently
i
believe
you
could
work
here
to
your
content
mabel
quite
understands
and
says
she
would
love
to
have
you
when
you
feel
free
to
come
she
has
changed
a
bit
back
to
her
old
natural
self
she
never
mentions
him
the
place
has
changed
too
in
certain
ways
it
has
more
cheerfulness
i
think
she
has
put
it
in
this
cheerfulness
spaded
it
in
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
it
lies
about
uneasily
and
is
not
natural
quite
the
organ
is
a
beauty
she
must
be
very
rich
now
but
she
as
gentle
and
sweet
as
ever
do
you
know
bill
i
think
he
must
have
frightened
her
into
marrying
him
i
get
the
impression
she
was
afraid
of
him
this
last
sentence
was
inked
out
i
but
i
read
it
through
the
scratching
the
letters
being
too
big
to
hide
he
had
an
inflexible
will
beneath
all
that
oily
kindness
which
passed
for
spiritual
he
was
a
real
personality
i
mean
i
sure
he
have
sent
you
and
me
cheerfully
to
the
stake
in
another
century
for
our
own
good
is
it
odd
she
never
speaks
of
him
even
to
me
this
again
was
stroked
through
though
without
the
intention
to
obliterate
merely
because
it
was
repetition
probably
the
only
reminder
of
him
in
the
house
now
is
a
big
copy
of
the
presentation
portrait
that
stands
on
the
stairs
of
the
multitechnic
institute
at
peckham
you
know
that
one
with
his
fat
hand
sprinkled
with
rings
resting
on
a
thick
bible
and
the
other
slipped
between
the
buttons
of
a
tight
it
hangs
in
the
dining
room
and
rather
dominates
our
meals
i
wish
mabel
would
take
it
down
i
think
she
like
to
if
she
dared
there
not
a
single
photograph
of
him
anywhere
even
in
her
own
room
marsh
is
here
you
remember
her
his
housekeeper
the
wife
of
the
man
who
got
penal
servitude
for
killing
a
baby
or
something
you
said
she
robbed
him
and
justified
her
stealing
because
the
story
of
the
unjust
steward
was
in
the
bible
how
we
laughed
over
that
she
just
the
same
too
gliding
about
all
over
the
house
and
turning
up
when
least
expected
other
reminiscences
filled
the
next
two
sides
of
the
letter
and
ran
without
a
trace
of
punctuation
into
instructions
about
a
salamander
stove
for
heating
my
in
the
flat
these
were
followed
by
things
i
was
to
tell
the
cook
and
by
requests
for
several
articles
she
had
forgotten
and
would
like
sent
after
her
two
of
them
blouses
with
descriptions
so
lengthy
and
contradictory
that
i
sighed
as
i
read
them
unless
you
come
down
soon
in
which
case
perhaps
you
would
mind
bringing
them
not
the
mauve
one
i
wear
in
the
evening
sometimes
but
the
pale
blue
one
with
lace
round
the
collar
and
the
crinkly
front
they
in
the
cupboard
or
the
drawer
i
not
sure
which
of
my
bedroom
ask
annie
if
you
in
doubt
thanks
most
awfully
send
a
telegram
remember
and
we
meet
you
in
the
motor
any
time
i
quite
know
if
i
shall
stay
the
whole
month
alone
it
all
depends
and
she
closed
the
letter
the
italicized
words
increasing
recklessly
towards
the
end
with
a
repetition
that
mabel
would
love
to
have
me
for
myself
as
also
to
have
a
man
in
the
house
and
that
i
only
had
to
telegraph
the
day
and
the
train
this
letter
coming
by
the
second
post
interrupted
me
in
a
moment
of
absorbing
work
and
having
read
it
through
to
make
sure
there
was
nothing
requiring
instant
attention
i
threw
it
aside
and
went
on
with
my
notes
and
reading
within
five
minutes
however
it
was
back
at
me
again
that
restless
thing
called
between
the
lines
fluttered
about
my
mind
my
interest
in
the
balkan
states
political
article
that
had
been
ordered
faded
somewhere
somehow
i
felt
disquieted
disturbed
at
first
i
persisted
in
my
work
forcing
myself
to
concentrate
but
soon
found
that
a
layer
of
new
impressions
floated
between
the
article
and
my
attention
it
was
like
a
shadow
though
a
shadow
that
dissolved
upon
inspection
once
or
twice
i
glanced
up
expecting
to
find
some
one
in
the
room
that
the
door
had
opened
unobserved
and
annie
was
waiting
for
instructions
i
heard
the
buses
thundering
across
the
bridge
i
was
aware
of
oakley
street
montenegro
and
the
blue
adriatic
melted
into
the
october
haze
along
that
depressing
embankment
that
aped
a
riverbank
and
sentences
from
the
letter
flashed
before
my
eyes
and
stung
me
picking
it
up
and
reading
it
through
more
carefully
i
rang
the
bell
and
told
annie
to
find
the
blouses
and
pack
them
for
the
post
showing
her
finally
the
written
description
and
resenting
the
superior
smile
with
which
she
at
once
interrupted
i
know
them
sir
and
disappeared
but
it
was
not
the
blouses
it
was
that
exasperating
thing
between
the
lines
that
put
an
end
to
my
work
with
its
elusive
teasing
nuisance
the
first
sharp
impression
is
alone
of
value
in
such
a
case
for
once
analysis
begins
the
imagination
constructs
all
kinds
of
false
interpretation
the
more
i
thought
the
more
i
grew
fuddled
the
letter
it
seemed
to
me
wanted
to
say
another
thing
instead
the
eight
sheets
conveyed
it
merely
it
came
to
the
edge
of
disclosure
then
halted
there
was
something
on
the
writer
mind
and
i
felt
uneasy
studying
the
sentences
brought
however
no
revelation
but
increased
confusion
only
for
while
the
uneasiness
remained
the
first
clear
hint
had
vanished
in
the
end
i
closed
my
books
and
went
out
to
look
up
another
matter
at
the
british
museum
library
perhaps
i
should
discover
it
that
way
by
turning
the
mind
in
a
totally
new
direction
i
lunched
at
the
express
dairy
in
oxford
street
close
by
and
telephoned
to
annie
that
i
would
be
home
to
tea
at
five
and
at
tea
tired
physically
and
mentally
after
breathing
the
exhausted
air
of
the
rotunda
for
five
hours
my
mind
suddenly
delivered
up
its
original
impression
vivid
and
no
proof
accompanied
the
revelation
it
was
mere
presentiment
but
convincing
frances
was
disturbed
in
her
mind
her
orderly
sensible
housekeeping
mind
she
was
uneasy
even
perhaps
afraid
something
in
the
house
distressed
her
and
she
had
need
of
me
unless
i
went
down
her
time
of
rest
and
change
her
quite
necessary
holiday
in
fact
would
be
spoilt
she
was
too
unselfish
to
say
this
but
it
ran
everywhere
between
the
lines
i
saw
it
clearly
now
franklyn
moreover
and
that
meant
frances
too
would
like
a
man
in
the
house
it
was
a
disagreeable
phrase
a
suggestive
way
of
hinting
something
she
dared
not
state
definitely
the
two
women
in
that
great
lonely
barrack
of
a
house
were
afraid
my
sense
of
duty
affection
unselfishness
whatever
the
composite
emotion
may
be
termed
was
stirred
also
my
vanity
i
acted
quickly
lest
reflection
should
warp
clear
decent
judgment
annie
i
said
when
she
answered
the
bell
you
need
not
send
those
blouses
by
the
post
i
take
them
down
tomorrow
when
i
go
i
shall
be
away
a
week
or
two
possibly
longer
and
having
looked
up
a
train
i
hastened
out
to
telegraph
before
i
could
change
my
fickle
mind
but
no
desire
came
that
night
to
change
my
mind
i
was
doing
the
right
the
necessary
thing
i
was
even
in
something
of
a
hurry
to
get
down
to
the
towers
as
soon
as
possible
i
chose
an
early
afternoon
train
chapter
iii
a
telegram
had
told
me
to
come
to
a
town
ten
miles
from
the
house
so
i
was
saved
the
crawling
train
to
the
local
station
and
traveled
down
by
an
express
as
soon
as
we
left
london
the
fog
cleared
off
and
an
autumn
sun
though
without
heat
in
it
painted
the
landscape
with
golden
browns
and
yellows
my
spirits
rose
as
i
lay
back
in
the
luxurious
motor
and
sped
between
the
woods
and
hedges
oddly
enough
my
anxiety
of
overnight
had
disappeared
it
was
due
no
doubt
to
that
exaggeration
of
detail
which
reflection
in
loneliness
brings
frances
and
i
had
not
been
separated
for
over
a
year
and
her
letters
from
the
towers
told
so
little
it
had
seemed
unnatural
to
be
deprived
of
those
intimate
particulars
of
mood
and
feeling
i
was
accustomed
to
we
had
such
confidence
in
one
another
and
our
affection
was
so
deep
though
she
was
but
five
years
younger
than
myself
i
regarded
her
as
a
child
my
attitude
was
fatherly
in
return
she
certainly
mothered
me
with
a
solicitude
that
never
cloyed
i
felt
no
desire
to
marry
while
she
was
still
alive
she
painted
in
watercolors
with
a
reasonable
success
and
kept
house
for
me
i
wrote
reviewed
books
and
lectured
on
aesthetics
we
were
a
humdrum
couple
of
well
satisfied
with
life
and
all
i
feared
for
her
was
that
she
might
become
a
suffragette
or
be
taken
captive
by
one
of
these
wild
theories
that
caught
her
imagination
sometimes
and
that
mabel
for
one
had
fostered
as
for
myself
no
doubt
she
deemed
me
a
trifle
solid
or
stolid
i
forget
which
word
she
preferred
but
on
the
whole
there
was
just
sufficient
difference
of
opinion
to
make
intercourse
suggestive
without
monotony
and
certainly
without
quarrelling
drawing
in
deep
draughts
of
the
stinging
autumn
air
i
felt
happy
and
exhilarated
it
was
like
going
for
a
holiday
with
comfort
at
the
end
of
the
journey
instead
of
bargaining
for
centimes
but
my
heart
sank
noticeably
the
moment
the
house
came
into
view
the
long
drive
lined
with
hostile
monkey
trees
and
formal
wellingtonias
that
were
solemn
and
sedate
was
mere
extension
of
the
miniature
approach
to
a
thousand
semidetached
suburban
residences
and
the
appearance
of
the
towers
as
we
turned
the
corner
with
a
rush
suggested
a
commonplace
climax
to
a
story
that
had
begun
interestingly
almost
thrillingly
a
villa
had
escaped
from
the
shadow
of
the
crystal
palace
thumped
its
way
down
by
night
grown
suddenly
monstrous
in
a
shower
of
rich
rain
and
settled
itself
insolently
to
stay
ivy
climbed
about
the
opulent
walls
but
climbed
neatly
and
with
disfiguring
effect
sham
as
on
a
prison
or
the
simile
made
me
smile
an
orphan
asylum
there
was
no
hint
of
the
comely
roughness
of
untidy
ivy
on
a
ruin
clipped
trained
and
precise
it
was
as
on
a
protestant
church
i
swear
there
was
not
a
bird
nest
nor
a
single
earwig
in
it
anywhere
about
the
porch
it
was
particularly
thick
smothering
a
lamp
with
a
contrast
that
was
quite
horrible
extensive
spread
away
on
the
farther
side
of
the
house
the
numerous
towers
to
which
the
building
owed
its
name
seemed
made
to
hold
school
bells
and
the
windowsills
thick
with
potted
flowers
made
me
think
of
the
desolate
suburbs
of
brighton
or
bexhill
in
a
commanding
position
upon
the
crest
of
a
hill
it
overlooked
miles
of
undulating
wooded
country
southwards
to
the
downs
but
behind
it
to
the
north
thick
banks
of
ilex
holly
and
privet
protected
it
from
the
cleaner
and
more
stimulating
winds
hence
though
highly
placed
it
was
shut
in
three
years
had
passed
since
i
last
set
eyes
upon
it
but
the
unsightly
memory
i
had
retained
was
justified
by
the
reality
the
place
was
deplorable
it
is
my
habit
to
express
my
opinions
audibly
sometimes
when
impressions
are
strong
enough
to
warrant
it
but
now
i
only
sighed
oh
dear
as
i
extricated
my
legs
from
many
rugs
and
went
into
the
house
a
tall
with
the
bearing
of
a
grenadier
received
me
and
standing
behind
her
was
marsh
the
housekeeper
whom
i
remembered
because
her
untidy
back
hair
had
suggested
to
me
that
it
had
been
burnt
i
went
at
once
to
my
room
my
hostess
already
dressing
for
dinner
but
frances
came
in
to
see
me
just
as
i
was
struggling
with
my
black
tie
that
had
got
tangled
like
a
bootlace
she
fastened
it
for
me
in
a
neat
effective
bow
and
while
i
held
my
chin
up
for
the
operation
staring
blankly
at
the
ceiling
the
impression
came
i
wondered
was
it
her
touch
that
caused
it
that
something
in
her
trembled
shrinking
perhaps
is
the
truer
word
nothing
in
her
face
or
manner
betrayed
it
nor
in
her
pleasant
easy
talk
while
she
tidied
my
things
and
scolded
my
slovenly
packing
as
her
habit
was
questioning
me
about
the
servants
at
the
flat
the
blouses
though
right
were
crumpled
and
my
scolding
was
deserved
there
was
no
impatience
even
yet
somehow
or
other
the
suggestion
of
a
shrinking
reserve
and
holding
back
reached
my
mind
she
had
been
lonely
of
course
but
it
was
more
than
that
she
was
glad
that
i
had
come
yet
for
some
reason
unstated
she
could
have
wished
that
i
had
stayed
away
we
discussed
the
news
that
had
accumulated
during
our
brief
separation
and
in
doing
so
the
impression
at
best
exceedingly
slight
was
forgotten
my
chamber
was
large
and
beautifully
furnished
the
hall
and
dining
room
of
our
flat
would
have
gone
into
it
with
a
good
remainder
yet
it
was
not
a
place
i
could
settle
down
in
for
work
it
conveyed
the
idea
of
impermanence
making
me
feel
transient
as
in
a
hotel
bedroom
this
of
course
was
the
fact
but
some
rooms
convey
a
settled
lasting
hospitality
even
in
a
hotel
this
one
did
not
and
as
i
was
accustomed
to
work
in
the
room
i
slept
in
at
least
when
visiting
a
slight
frown
must
have
crept
between
my
eyes
mabel
has
fitted
a
for
you
just
out
of
the
library
said
the
clairvoyant
frances
no
one
will
disturb
you
there
and
you
have
fifteen
thousand
books
all
catalogued
within
easy
reach
there
a
private
staircase
too
you
can
breakfast
in
your
room
and
slip
down
in
your
dressing
gown
if
you
want
to
she
laughed
my
spirits
took
a
turn
upwards
as
absurdly
as
they
had
gone
down
and
how
are
you
i
asked
giving
her
a
belated
kiss
it
jolly
to
be
together
again
i
did
feel
rather
lost
without
you
i
admit
that
natural
she
laughed
i
so
glad
she
looked
well
and
had
country
color
in
her
cheeks
she
informed
me
that
she
was
eating
and
sleeping
well
going
out
for
little
walks
with
mabel
painting
bits
of
scenery
again
and
enjoying
a
complete
change
and
rest
and
yet
for
all
her
brave
description
the
word
somehow
did
not
quite
ring
true
those
last
words
in
particular
did
not
ring
true
there
lay
in
her
manner
just
out
of
sight
i
felt
this
suggestion
of
the
exact
reverse
of
unrest
shrinking
almost
of
anxiety
certain
small
strings
in
her
seemed
was
the
slang
expression
that
crossed
my
mind
i
looked
rather
searchingly
into
her
face
as
she
was
telling
me
this
only
the
evenings
she
added
noticing
my
query
yet
rather
avoiding
my
eyes
the
evenings
are
well
rather
heavy
sometimes
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
keep
awake
the
strong
air
after
london
makes
you
drowsy
i
suggested
and
you
like
to
get
early
to
bed
frances
turned
and
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
steadily
on
the
contrary
bill
i
dislike
going
to
bed
here
and
mabel
goes
so
early
she
said
it
lightly
enough
fingering
the
disorder
upon
my
dressing
table
in
such
a
stupid
way
that
i
saw
her
mind
was
working
in
another
direction
altogether
she
looked
up
suddenly
with
a
kind
of
nervousness
from
the
brush
and
scissors
billy
she
said
abruptly
lowering
her
voice
is
it
odd
but
i
hate
sleeping
alone
here
i
ca
make
it
out
quite
i
never
felt
such
a
thing
before
in
my
life
do
you
think
it
all
nonsense
and
she
laughed
with
her
lips
but
not
with
her
eyes
there
was
a
note
of
defiance
in
her
i
failed
to
understand
nothing
a
nature
like
yours
feels
strongly
is
nonsense
frances
i
replied
soothingly
but
i
too
answered
with
my
lips
only
for
another
part
of
my
mind
was
working
elsewhere
and
among
uncomfortable
things
a
touch
of
bewilderment
passed
over
me
i
was
not
certain
how
best
to
continue
if
i
laughed
she
would
tell
me
no
more
yet
if
i
took
her
too
seriously
the
strings
would
tighten
further
instinctively
then
this
flashed
rapidly
across
me
that
something
of
what
she
felt
i
had
also
felt
though
interpreting
it
differently
vague
it
was
as
the
coming
of
rain
or
storm
that
announce
themselves
hours
in
advance
with
their
hint
of
faint
unsettling
excitement
in
the
air
i
had
been
but
a
short
hour
in
the
house
big
comfortable
luxurious
house
but
had
experienced
this
sense
of
being
unsettled
unfixed
fluctuating
a
kind
of
impermanence
that
transient
lodgers
in
hotels
must
feel
but
that
a
guest
in
a
friend
home
ought
not
to
feel
be
the
visit
short
or
long
to
frances
an
impressionable
woman
the
feeling
had
come
in
the
terms
of
alarm
she
disliked
sleeping
alone
while
yet
she
longed
to
sleep
the
precise
idea
in
my
mind
evaded
capture
merely
brushing
through
me
out
of
sight
i
realized
only
that
we
both
felt
the
same
thing
and
that
neither
of
us
could
get
at
it
clearly
degrees
of
unrest
we
felt
but
the
actual
thing
did
not
disclose
itself
it
did
not
happen
i
felt
strangely
at
sea
for
a
moment
frances
would
interpret
hesitation
as
endorsement
and
encouragement
might
be
the
last
thing
that
could
help
her
sleeping
in
a
strange
house
i
answered
at
length
is
often
difficult
at
first
and
one
feels
lonely
after
fifteen
months
in
our
tiny
flat
one
feels
lost
and
in
a
big
house
it
an
uncomfortable
feeling
i
know
it
well
and
this
is
a
barrack
is
it
the
masses
of
furniture
only
make
it
worse
one
feels
in
storage
somewhere
underground
the
furniture
does
furnish
one
must
never
yield
to
fancies
though
frances
looked
away
towards
the
windows
she
seemed
disappointed
a
little
after
our
chelsea
i
went
on
quickly
it
seems
isolated
here
but
she
did
not
turn
back
and
clearly
i
was
saying
the
wrong
thing
a
wave
of
pity
rushed
suddenly
over
me
was
she
really
frightened
perhaps
she
was
imaginative
i
knew
but
never
moody
common
sense
was
strong
in
her
though
she
had
her
times
of
hypersensitiveness
i
caught
the
echo
of
some
unreasoning
big
alarm
in
her
she
stood
there
gazing
across
my
balcony
towards
the
sea
of
wooded
country
that
spread
dim
and
vague
in
the
obscurity
of
the
dusk
the
deepening
shadows
entered
the
room
i
fancied
from
the
grounds
below
following
her
abstracted
gaze
a
moment
i
experienced
a
curious
sharp
desire
to
leave
to
escape
out
yonder
was
wind
and
space
and
freedom
this
enormous
building
was
oppressive
silent
still
great
catacombs
occurred
to
me
things
beneath
the
ground
imprisonment
and
capture
i
believe
i
even
shuddered
a
little
i
touched
her
shoulder
she
turned
round
slowly
and
we
looked
with
a
certain
deliberation
into
each
other
eyes
fanny
i
asked
more
gravely
than
i
intended
you
are
not
frightened
are
you
nothing
has
happened
has
it
she
replied
with
emphasis
of
course
not
how
could
it
i
mean
why
should
i
she
stammered
as
though
the
wrong
sentence
flustered
her
a
second
it
simply
that
i
have
this
ter
this
dislike
of
sleeping
alone
naturally
my
first
thought
was
how
easy
it
would
be
to
cut
our
visit
short
but
i
did
not
say
this
had
it
been
a
true
solution
frances
would
have
said
it
for
me
long
ago
would
mabel
with
you
i
said
instead
or
give
you
an
adjoining
room
so
that
you
could
leave
the
door
between
you
open
there
space
enough
heaven
knows
and
then
as
the
gong
sounded
in
the
hall
below
for
dinner
she
said
as
with
an
effort
this
thing
mabel
did
ask
me
on
the
third
night
after
i
had
told
her
but
i
declined
you
rather
be
alone
than
with
her
i
asked
with
a
certain
relief
her
reply
was
so
gravely
given
a
child
would
have
known
there
was
more
behind
it
not
that
but
that
she
did
not
really
want
it
i
had
a
moment
intuition
and
acted
on
it
impulsively
she
feels
it
too
perhaps
but
wishes
to
face
it
by
herself
and
get
over
it
my
sister
bowed
her
head
and
the
gesture
made
me
realize
of
a
sudden
how
grave
and
solemn
our
talk
had
grown
as
though
some
portentous
thing
were
under
discussion
it
had
come
of
itself
indefinite
as
a
gradual
change
of
temperature
yet
neither
of
us
knew
its
nature
for
apparently
neither
of
us
could
state
it
plainly
nothing
happened
even
in
our
words
that
was
my
impression
she
said
that
if
she
yields
to
it
she
encourages
it
and
a
habit
forms
so
easily
just
think
she
added
with
a
faint
smile
that
was
the
first
sign
of
lightness
she
had
yet
betrayed
what
a
nuisance
it
would
be
everywhere
if
everybody
was
afraid
of
being
alone
like
that
i
snatched
readily
at
the
chance
we
laughed
a
little
though
it
was
a
quiet
kind
of
laughter
that
seemed
wrong
i
took
her
arm
and
led
her
towards
the
door
disastrous
in
fact
i
agreed
she
raised
her
voice
to
its
normal
pitch
again
as
i
had
done
no
doubt
it
will
pass
she
said
now
that
you
have
come
of
course
chiefly
my
imagination
her
tone
was
lighter
though
nothing
could
convince
me
that
the
matter
itself
was
light
just
then
and
in
any
case
tightening
her
grip
on
my
arm
as
we
passed
into
the
bright
enormous
corridor
and
caught
sight
of
franklyn
waiting
in
the
cheerless
hall
below
i
very
glad
you
here
bill
and
mabel
i
know
is
too
if
it
does
pass
i
just
had
time
to
whisper
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
jollity
i
come
at
night
and
snore
outside
your
door
after
that
you
be
so
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
that
you
wo
mind
being
alone
that
a
bargain
said
frances
i
shook
my
hostess
by
the
hand
made
a
banal
remark
about
the
long
interval
since
last
we
met
and
walked
behind
them
into
the
great
dining
room
dimly
lit
by
candles
wondering
in
my
heart
how
long
my
sister
and
i
should
stay
and
why
in
the
world
we
had
ever
left
our
cozy
little
flat
to
enter
this
desolation
of
riches
and
false
luxury
at
all
the
unsightly
picture
of
the
late
samuel
franklyn
stared
down
upon
me
from
the
farther
end
of
the
room
above
the
mighty
mantelpiece
he
looked
i
thought
like
some
pompous
heavenly
butler
who
denied
to
all
the
world
and
to
us
in
particular
the
right
of
entry
without
presentation
cards
signed
by
his
hand
as
proof
that
we
belonged
to
his
own
exclusive
set
the
majority
to
his
deep
grief
and
in
spite
of
all
his
prayers
on
their
behalf
must
burn
and
perish
everlastingly
chapter
iv
with
the
instinct
of
the
healthy
bachelor
i
always
try
to
make
myself
a
nest
in
the
place
i
live
in
be
it
for
long
or
short
whether
visiting
in
or
in
hotel
the
first
essential
is
this
nest
own
things
built
into
the
walls
as
a
bird
builds
in
its
feathers
it
may
look
desolate
and
uncomfortable
enough
to
others
because
the
central
detail
is
neither
bed
nor
wardrobe
sofa
nor
armchair
but
a
good
solid
that
does
not
wriggle
and
that
has
wide
elbowroom
and
the
towers
is
vividly
described
for
me
by
the
single
fact
that
i
could
not
nest
there
i
took
several
days
to
discover
this
but
the
first
impression
of
impermanence
was
truer
than
i
knew
the
feathers
of
the
mind
refused
here
to
lie
one
way
they
ruffled
pointed
and
grew
wild
luxurious
furniture
does
not
mean
comfort
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
settle
down
in
the
sofa
and
armchair
department
of
a
big
shop
my
bedroom
was
easily
managed
it
was
the
private
workroom
prepared
especially
for
my
reception
that
made
me
feel
alien
and
outcast
externally
it
was
all
one
could
desire
an
antechamber
to
the
great
library
with
not
one
but
two
generous
oak
tables
to
say
nothing
of
smaller
ones
against
the
walls
with
capacious
drawers
there
were
reading
desks
mechanical
devices
for
holding
books
perfect
light
quiet
as
in
a
church
and
no
approach
but
across
the
huge
adjoining
room
yet
it
did
not
invite
i
hope
you
be
able
to
work
here
said
my
little
hostess
the
next
morning
as
she
took
me
in
her
only
visit
to
it
while
i
stayed
in
the
house
and
showed
me
the
catalogue
it
absolutely
quiet
and
no
one
will
disturb
you
if
you
ca
bill
you
not
much
good
laughed
frances
who
was
on
her
arm
even
i
could
write
in
a
study
like
this
i
glanced
with
pleasure
at
the
ample
tables
the
sheets
of
thick
blotting
paper
the
rulers
sealing
wax
paper
knives
and
all
the
other
immaculate
paraphernalia
it
perfect
i
answered
with
a
secret
thrill
yet
feeling
a
little
foolish
this
was
for
gibbon
or
carlyle
rather
than
for
my
potboiling
insignificancies
if
i
ca
write
masterpieces
here
it
certainly
not
your
fault
and
i
turned
with
gratitude
to
franklyn
she
was
looking
straight
at
me
and
there
was
a
question
in
her
small
pale
eyes
i
did
not
understand
was
she
noting
the
effect
upon
me
i
wondered
you
write
here
perhaps
a
story
about
the
house
she
said
thompson
will
bring
you
anything
you
want
you
only
have
to
ring
she
pointed
to
the
electric
bell
on
the
central
table
the
wire
running
neatly
down
the
leg
no
one
has
ever
worked
here
before
and
the
library
has
been
hardly
used
since
it
was
put
in
so
there
no
previous
atmosphere
to
affect
your
imagination
er
adversely
we
laughed
bill
is
that
sort
said
my
sister
while
i
wished
they
would
go
out
and
leave
me
to
arrange
my
little
nest
and
set
to
work
i
thought
of
course
it
was
the
huge
listening
library
that
made
me
feel
so
inconsiderable
the
fifteen
thousand
silent
staring
books
the
solemn
aisles
the
deep
eloquent
shelves
but
when
the
women
had
gone
and
i
was
alone
the
beginning
of
the
truth
crept
over
me
and
i
felt
that
first
hint
of
disconsolateness
which
later
became
an
imperative
no
the
mind
shut
down
images
ceased
to
rise
and
flow
i
read
made
copious
notes
but
i
wrote
no
single
line
at
the
towers
nothing
completed
itself
there
nothing
happened
the
morning
sunshine
poured
into
the
library
through
ten
long
narrow
windows
birds
were
singing
the
autumn
air
rich
with
a
faint
aroma
of
november
melancholy
that
stung
the
imagination
pleasantly
filled
my
antechamber
i
looked
out
upon
the
undulating
wooded
landscape
hemmed
in
by
the
sweep
of
distant
downs
and
i
tasted
a
whiff
of
the
sea
rooks
cawed
as
they
floated
above
the
elms
and
there
were
lazy
cows
in
the
nearer
meadows
a
dozen
times
i
tried
to
make
my
nest
and
settle
down
to
work
and
a
dozen
times
like
a
turning
fastidious
dog
upon
a
hearth
rug
i
rearranged
my
chair
and
books
and
papers
the
temptation
of
the
catalogue
and
shelves
of
course
was
accountable
for
much
yet
not
i
felt
for
all
that
was
a
manageable
seduction
my
work
moreover
was
not
of
the
creative
kind
that
requires
absolute
absorption
it
was
the
mere
readable
presentation
of
data
i
had
accumulated
my
notebooks
were
charged
with
facts
ready
to
tabulate
facts
too
that
interested
me
keenly
a
mere
effort
of
the
will
was
necessary
and
concentration
of
no
difficult
kind
yet
somehow
it
seemed
beyond
me
something
forever
pushed
the
facts
into
disorder
and
in
the
end
i
sat
in
the
sunshine
dipping
into
a
dozen
books
selected
from
the
shelves
outside
vexed
with
myself
and
only
it
i
felt
restless
i
wanted
to
be
elsewhere
and
even
while
i
read
attention
wandered
frances
mabel
her
late
husband
the
house
and
grounds
each
in
turn
and
sometimes
all
together
rose
uninvited
into
the
stream
of
thought
hindering
any
consecutive
flow
of
work
in
disconnected
fashion
came
these
pictures
that
interrupted
concentration
yet
presenting
themselves
as
broken
fragments
of
a
bigger
thing
my
mind
already
groped
for
unconsciously
they
fluttered
round
this
hidden
thing
of
which
they
were
aspects
fugitive
interpretations
no
one
of
them
bringing
complete
revelation
there
was
no
adjective
such
as
pleasant
or
unpleasant
that
i
could
attach
to
what
i
felt
beyond
that
the
result
was
unsettling
vague
as
the
atmosphere
of
a
dream
it
yet
persisted
and
i
could
not
dissipate
it
isolated
words
or
phrases
in
the
lines
i
read
sent
questions
scouring
across
my
mind
sure
sign
that
the
deeper
part
of
me
was
restless
and
ill
at
ease
rather
trivial
questions
too
interrogations
as
of
a
puzzled
or
curious
child
why
was
my
sister
afraid
to
sleep
alone
and
why
did
her
friend
feel
a
similar
repugnance
yet
seek
to
conquer
it
why
was
the
solid
luxury
of
the
house
without
comfort
its
shelter
without
the
sense
of
permanence
why
had
franklyn
asked
us
to
come
artists
unbelieving
vagabonds
types
at
the
farthest
possible
remove
from
the
saved
sheep
of
her
husband
household
had
a
reaction
set
in
against
the
hysteria
of
her
conversion
i
had
seen
no
signs
of
religious
fervor
in
her
her
atmosphere
was
that
of
an
ordinary
woman
yet
a
woman
of
the
world
lifeless
though
a
little
perhaps
now
that
i
came
to
think
about
it
she
had
made
no
definite
impression
upon
me
of
any
kind
and
my
thoughts
ran
vaguely
after
this
fragile
clue
closing
my
book
i
let
them
run
for
with
this
chance
reflection
came
the
discovery
that
i
could
not
see
her
clearly
could
not
feel
her
soul
her
personality
her
face
her
small
pale
eyes
her
dress
and
body
and
walk
all
these
stood
before
me
like
a
photograph
but
her
self
evaded
me
she
seemed
not
there
lifeless
empty
a
shadow
nothing
the
picture
was
disagreeable
and
i
put
it
by
instantly
she
melted
out
as
though
light
thought
had
conjured
up
a
phantom
that
had
no
real
existence
and
at
that
very
moment
singularly
enough
my
eye
caught
sight
of
her
moving
past
the
window
going
silently
along
the
gravel
path
i
watched
her
a
sudden
new
sensation
gripping
me
there
goes
a
prisoner
my
thought
instantly
ran
one
who
wishes
to
escape
but
can
not
what
brought
the
outlandish
notion
heaven
only
knows
the
house
was
of
her
own
choice
she
was
twice
an
heiress
and
the
world
lay
open
at
her
feet
yet
she
stayed
unhappy
frightened
caught
all
this
flashed
over
me
and
made
a
sharp
impression
even
before
i
had
time
to
dismiss
it
as
absurd
but
a
moment
later
explanation
offered
itself
though
it
seemed
as
as
the
original
impression
my
mind
being
logical
was
obliged
to
provide
something
apparently
for
franklyn
while
dressed
to
go
out
with
thick
a
pointed
stick
and
a
tied
on
with
a
veil
as
for
the
windy
lanes
was
obviously
content
to
go
no
farther
than
the
little
garden
paths
the
costume
was
a
sham
and
a
pretence
it
was
this
and
her
lithe
quick
movements
that
suggested
a
caged
creature
a
creature
tamed
by
fear
and
cruelty
that
cloaked
themselves
in
kindness
pacing
up
and
down
unable
to
realize
why
it
got
no
farther
but
always
met
the
same
bars
in
exactly
the
same
place
the
mind
in
her
was
barred
i
watched
her
go
along
the
paths
and
down
the
steps
from
one
terrace
to
another
until
the
laurels
hid
her
altogether
and
into
this
mere
imagining
of
a
moment
came
a
hint
of
something
slightly
disagreeable
for
which
my
mind
search
as
it
would
found
no
explanation
at
all
i
remembered
then
certain
other
little
things
they
dropped
into
the
picture
of
their
own
accord
in
a
mind
not
deliberately
hunting
for
clues
pieces
of
a
puzzle
sometimes
come
together
in
this
way
bringing
revelation
so
that
for
a
second
there
flashed
across
me
vanishing
instantly
again
before
i
could
consider
it
a
large
distressing
thought
i
can
only
describe
vaguely
as
a
shadow
dark
and
ugly
oppressive
certainly
it
might
be
described
with
something
torn
and
dreadful
about
the
edges
that
suggested
pain
and
strife
and
terror
the
interior
of
a
prison
with
two
rows
of
occupied
condemned
cells
seen
years
ago
in
new
york
sprang
to
memory
after
it
the
connection
between
the
two
impossible
to
surmise
even
but
the
certain
other
little
things
mentioned
above
were
these
that
franklyn
in
last
night
dinner
talk
had
always
referred
to
this
house
but
never
called
it
home
and
had
emphasized
unnecessarily
for
a
woman
our
great
kindness
in
coming
down
to
stay
so
long
with
her
another
time
in
answer
to
my
futile
compliment
about
the
stately
rooms
she
said
quietly
it
is
an
enormous
house
for
so
small
a
party
but
i
stay
here
very
little
and
only
till
i
get
it
straight
again
the
three
of
us
were
going
up
the
great
staircase
to
bed
as
this
was
said
and
not
knowing
quite
her
meaning
i
dropped
the
subject
it
edged
delicate
ground
i
felt
frances
added
no
word
of
her
own
it
now
occurred
to
me
abruptly
that
stay
was
the
word
made
use
of
when
live
would
have
been
more
natural
how
insignificant
to
recall
yet
why
did
they
suggest
themselves
just
at
this
moment
and
on
going
to
frances
room
to
make
sure
she
was
not
nervous
or
lonely
i
realized
abruptly
that
franklyn
of
course
had
talked
with
her
in
a
confidential
sense
that
i
as
a
mere
visiting
brother
could
not
share
frances
had
told
me
nothing
i
might
easily
have
wormed
it
out
of
her
had
i
not
felt
that
for
us
to
discuss
further
our
hostess
and
her
house
merely
because
we
were
under
the
roof
together
was
not
quite
nice
or
loyal
i
call
you
bill
if
i
scared
she
had
laughed
as
we
parted
my
room
being
just
across
the
big
corridor
from
her
own
i
had
fallen
asleep
thinking
what
in
the
world
was
meant
by
getting
it
straight
again
and
now
in
my
antechamber
to
the
library
on
the
second
morning
sitting
among
piles
of
foolscap
and
sheets
of
spotless
all
useless
to
me
these
slight
hints
came
back
and
helped
to
frame
the
big
vague
shadow
i
have
mentioned
up
to
the
neck
in
this
shadow
almost
drowned
yet
just
treading
water
stood
the
figure
of
my
hostess
in
her
walking
costume
frances
and
i
seemed
swimming
to
her
aid
the
shadow
was
large
enough
to
include
both
house
and
grounds
but
farther
than
that
i
could
not
see
dismissing
it
i
fell
to
reading
my
purloined
book
again
before
i
turned
another
page
however
another
startling
detail
leaped
out
at
me
the
figure
of
franklyn
in
the
shadow
was
not
living
it
floated
helplessly
like
a
doll
or
puppet
that
has
no
life
in
it
it
was
both
pathetic
and
dreadful
any
one
who
sits
in
reverie
thus
of
course
may
see
similar
ridiculous
pictures
when
the
will
no
longer
guides
construction
the
incongruities
of
dreams
are
thus
explained
i
merely
record
the
picture
as
it
came
that
it
remained
by
me
for
several
days
just
as
vivid
dreams
do
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
dwell
upon
it
the
curious
thing
perhaps
is
that
from
this
moment
i
date
my
inclination
though
not
yet
my
desire
to
leave
i
purposely
say
to
leave
i
can
not
quite
remember
when
the
word
changed
to
that
aggressive
frantic
thing
which
is
escape
chapter
v
we
were
left
delightfully
to
ourselves
in
this
pretentious
country
mansion
with
the
soul
of
a
villa
frances
took
up
her
painting
again
and
the
weather
being
propitious
spent
hours
out
of
doors
sketching
flowers
trees
and
nooks
of
woodland
garden
even
the
house
itself
where
bits
of
it
peered
suggestively
across
the
orchards
franklyn
seemed
always
busy
about
something
or
other
and
never
interfered
with
us
except
to
propose
motoring
tea
in
another
part
of
the
lawn
and
so
forth
she
flitted
everywhere
preoccupied
yet
apparently
doing
nothing
the
house
engulfed
her
rather
no
visitor
called
for
one
thing
she
was
not
supposed
to
be
back
from
abroad
yet
and
for
another
i
think
the
neighborhood
her
husband
neighborhood
was
puzzled
by
her
sudden
cessation
from
good
works
brigades
and
temperance
societies
did
not
ask
to
hold
their
meetings
in
the
big
hall
and
the
vicar
arranged
the
in
another
field
without
explanation
the
portrait
in
the
dining
room
and
the
presence
of
the
housekeeper
with
the
burnt
back
hair
indeed
were
the
only
reminders
of
the
man
who
once
had
lived
here
marsh
retained
her
place
in
silence
sinecure
as
it
doubtless
was
yet
with
no
hint
of
that
suppressed
disapproval
one
might
have
expected
from
her
indeed
there
was
nothing
positive
to
disapprove
since
nothing
worldly
entered
grounds
or
building
in
her
master
lifetime
she
had
been
another
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
and
it
had
then
been
her
custom
to
give
vociferous
testimony
at
the
revival
meetings
where
he
adorned
the
platform
and
led
in
streams
of
prayer
i
saw
her
sometimes
on
the
stairs
hovering
wandering
and
and
the
idea
came
to
me
once
that
this
woman
somehow
formed
a
link
with
the
departed
influence
of
her
bigoted
employer
she
alone
among
us
belonged
to
the
house
and
looked
at
home
there
when
i
saw
her
talking
oh
with
such
correct
and
respectful
mien
to
franklyn
i
had
the
feeling
that
for
all
her
unaggressive
attitude
she
yet
exerted
some
influence
that
sought
to
make
her
mistress
stay
in
the
building
forever
live
there
she
would
prevent
her
escape
prevent
getting
it
straight
again
thwart
somehow
her
will
to
freedom
if
she
could
the
idea
in
me
was
of
the
most
fleeting
kind
but
another
time
when
i
came
down
late
at
night
to
get
a
book
from
the
library
antechamber
and
found
her
sitting
in
the
hall
alone
the
impression
left
upon
me
was
the
reverse
of
fleeting
i
can
never
forget
the
vivid
disagreeable
effect
it
produced
upon
me
what
was
she
doing
there
at
eleven
at
night
all
alone
in
the
darkness
she
was
sitting
upright
stiff
in
a
big
chair
below
the
clock
it
gave
me
a
turn
it
was
so
incongruous
and
odd
she
rose
quietly
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
stairs
and
asked
me
respectfully
her
eyes
cast
down
as
usual
whether
i
had
finished
with
the
library
so
that
she
might
lock
up
there
was
no
more
to
it
than
that
but
the
picture
stayed
with
me
unpleasantly
these
various
impressions
came
to
me
at
odd
moments
of
course
and
not
in
a
single
sequence
as
i
now
relate
them
i
was
hard
at
work
before
three
days
were
past
not
writing
as
explained
but
reading
making
notes
and
gathering
material
from
the
library
for
future
use
it
was
in
chance
moments
that
these
curious
flashes
came
catching
me
unawares
with
a
touch
of
surprise
that
sometimes
made
me
start
for
they
proved
that
my
was
still
conscious
of
the
shadow
and
that
far
away
out
of
sight
lay
the
cause
of
it
that
left
me
with
a
vague
unrest
unsettled
seeking
to
nest
in
a
place
that
did
not
want
me
only
when
this
deeper
part
knows
harmony
perhaps
can
good
brainwork
result
and
my
inability
to
write
was
thus
explained
certainly
i
was
always
seeking
for
something
here
i
could
not
find
an
explanation
that
continually
evaded
me
nothing
but
these
trivial
hints
offered
themselves
lumped
together
however
they
had
the
effect
of
defining
the
shadow
a
little
i
became
more
and
more
aware
of
its
very
real
existence
and
if
i
have
made
little
mention
of
frances
and
my
hostess
in
this
connection
it
is
because
they
contributed
at
first
little
or
nothing
towards
the
discovery
of
what
this
story
tries
to
tell
our
life
was
wholly
external
normal
quiet
and
uneventful
conversation
banal
franklyn
conversation
in
particular
they
said
nothing
that
suggested
revelation
both
were
in
this
shadow
and
both
knew
that
they
were
in
it
but
neither
betrayed
by
word
or
act
a
hint
of
interpretation
they
talked
privately
no
doubt
but
of
that
i
can
report
no
details
and
so
it
was
that
after
ten
days
of
a
very
commonplace
visit
i
found
myself
looking
straight
into
the
face
of
a
strangeness
that
defied
capture
at
close
quarters
there
something
here
that
never
happens
were
the
words
that
rose
in
my
mind
and
that
why
none
of
us
can
speak
of
it
and
as
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
watched
the
vulgar
blackbirds
with
toes
turned
in
boring
out
their
worms
i
realized
sharply
that
even
they
as
indeed
everything
large
and
small
in
the
house
and
grounds
shared
this
strangeness
and
were
twisted
out
of
normal
appearance
because
of
it
life
as
expressed
in
the
entire
place
was
crumpled
dwarfed
emasculated
god
meanings
here
were
crippled
his
love
of
joy
was
stunted
nothing
in
the
garden
danced
or
sang
there
was
hate
in
it
the
shadow
my
thought
hurried
on
to
completion
is
a
manifestation
of
hate
and
hate
is
the
devil
and
then
i
sat
back
frightened
in
my
chair
for
i
knew
that
i
had
partly
found
the
truth
leaving
my
books
i
went
out
into
the
open
the
sky
was
overcast
yet
the
day
by
no
means
gloomy
for
a
soft
diffused
light
oozed
through
the
clouds
and
turned
all
things
warm
and
almost
summery
but
i
saw
the
grounds
now
in
their
nakedness
because
i
understood
hate
means
strife
and
the
two
together
weave
the
robe
that
terror
wears
having
no
religious
beliefs
myself
nor
belonging
to
any
set
of
dogmas
called
a
creed
i
could
stand
outside
these
feelings
and
observe
yet
they
soaked
into
me
sufficiently
for
me
to
grasp
sympathetically
what
others
with
more
cabined
souls
i
flattered
myself
might
feel
that
picture
in
the
dining
room
stalked
everywhere
hid
behind
every
tree
peered
down
upon
me
from
the
peaked
ugliness
of
the
bourgeois
towers
and
left
the
impress
of
its
powerful
hand
upon
every
bed
of
flowers
you
must
not
do
this
you
must
not
do
that
went
past
me
through
the
air
you
must
not
leave
these
narrow
paths
said
the
rigid
iron
railings
of
black
you
shall
not
walk
here
was
written
on
the
lawns
keep
to
the
steps
do
pick
the
flowers
make
no
noise
of
laughter
singing
dancing
was
placarded
all
over
the
and
trespassers
will
be
not
prosecuted
but
destroyed
hung
from
the
crest
of
monkey
tree
and
holly
guarding
the
ends
of
each
artificial
terrace
stood
gaunt
implacable
policemen
warders
jailers
come
with
us
they
chanted
or
be
damned
eternally
i
remember
feeling
quite
pleased
with
myself
that
i
had
discovered
this
obvious
explanation
of
the
prison
feeling
the
place
breathed
out
that
the
posthumous
influence
of
heavy
old
samuel
franklyn
might
be
an
inadequate
solution
did
not
occur
to
me
by
getting
the
place
straight
again
his
widow
of
course
meant
forgetting
the
glamour
of
fear
and
foreboding
his
depressing
creed
had
temporarily
forced
upon
her
and
frances
delicately
minded
being
did
not
speak
of
it
because
it
was
the
influence
of
the
man
her
friend
had
loved
i
felt
lighter
a
load
was
lifted
from
me
to
trace
the
unfamiliar
to
the
familiar
came
back
a
sentence
i
had
read
somewhere
is
to
understand
it
was
a
real
relief
i
could
talk
with
frances
now
even
with
my
hostess
no
danger
of
treading
clumsily
for
the
key
was
in
my
hands
i
might
even
help
to
dissipate
the
shadow
to
get
it
straight
again
it
seemed
perhaps
our
long
invitation
was
explained
i
went
into
the
house
laughing
at
myself
a
little
perhaps
after
all
the
artist
outlook
with
no
hard
and
fast
dogmas
is
as
narrow
as
the
others
how
small
humanity
is
and
why
is
there
no
possible
and
true
combination
of
all
outlooks
the
feeling
of
unsettling
was
very
strong
in
me
just
then
in
spite
of
my
big
discovery
which
was
to
clear
everything
up
and
at
the
moment
i
ran
into
frances
on
the
stairs
with
a
portfolio
of
sketches
under
her
arm
it
came
across
me
then
abruptly
that
although
she
had
worked
a
great
deal
since
we
came
she
had
shown
me
nothing
it
struck
me
suddenly
as
odd
unnatural
the
way
she
tried
to
pass
me
now
confirmed
my
newborn
suspicion
that
well
that
her
results
were
hardly
what
they
ought
to
be
stand
and
deliver
i
laughed
stepping
in
front
of
her
i
seen
nothing
you
done
since
you
been
here
and
as
a
rule
you
show
me
all
your
things
i
believe
they
are
atrocious
and
degrading
then
my
laughter
froze
she
made
a
sly
gesture
to
slip
past
me
and
i
almost
decided
to
let
her
go
for
the
expression
that
flashed
across
her
face
shocked
me
she
looked
uncomfortable
and
ashamed
the
color
came
and
went
a
moment
in
he
cheeks
making
me
think
of
a
child
detected
in
some
secret
naughtiness
it
was
almost
fear
it
because
they
not
finished
then
i
said
dropping
the
tone
of
banter
or
because
they
too
good
for
me
to
understand
for
my
criticism
of
painting
she
told
me
was
crude
and
ignorant
sometimes
but
you
let
me
see
them
later
wo
you
frances
however
did
not
take
the
way
of
escape
i
offered
she
changed
her
mind
she
drew
the
portfolio
from
beneath
her
arm
instead
you
can
see
them
if
you
really
want
to
bill
she
said
quietly
and
her
tone
reminded
me
of
a
nurse
who
says
to
a
boy
just
grown
out
of
childhood
you
are
old
enough
now
to
look
upon
horror
and
ugliness
only
i
advise
it
i
do
want
to
i
said
and
made
to
go
downstairs
with
her
but
instead
she
said
in
the
same
low
voice
as
before
come
up
to
my
room
we
shall
be
undisturbed
there
so
i
guessed
that
she
had
been
on
her
way
to
show
the
paintings
to
our
hostess
but
did
not
care
for
us
all
three
to
see
them
together
my
mind
worked
furiously
mabel
asked
me
to
do
them
she
explained
in
a
tone
of
submissive
horror
once
the
door
was
shut
in
fact
she
begged
it
of
me
you
know
how
persistent
she
is
in
her
quiet
way
i
er
had
to
she
flushed
and
opened
the
portfolio
on
the
little
table
by
the
window
standing
behind
me
as
i
turned
the
sketches
over
sketches
of
the
grounds
and
trees
and
garden
in
the
first
moment
of
inspection
however
i
did
not
take
in
clearly
why
my
sister
sense
of
modesty
had
been
offended
for
my
attention
flashed
a
second
elsewhere
another
bit
of
the
puzzle
had
dropped
into
place
defining
still
further
the
nature
of
what
i
called
the
shadow
franklyn
i
now
remembered
had
suggested
to
me
in
the
library
that
i
might
perhaps
write
something
about
the
place
and
i
had
taken
it
for
one
of
her
banal
sentences
and
paid
no
further
attention
i
realized
now
that
it
was
said
in
earnest
she
wanted
our
interpretations
as
expressed
in
our
respective
talents
painting
and
writing
her
invitation
was
explained
she
left
us
to
ourselves
on
purpose
i
should
like
to
tear
them
up
frances
was
whispering
behind
me
with
a
shudder
only
i
promised
she
hesitated
a
moment
promised
not
to
i
asked
with
a
queer
feeling
of
distress
my
eyes
glued
to
the
papers
promised
always
to
show
them
to
her
first
she
finished
so
low
i
barely
caught
it
i
have
no
intuitive
immediate
grasp
of
the
value
of
paintings
results
come
to
me
slowly
and
though
every
one
believes
his
own
judgment
to
be
good
i
dare
not
claim
that
mine
is
worth
more
than
that
of
any
other
layman
frances
had
too
often
convicted
me
of
gross
ignorance
and
error
i
can
only
say
that
i
examined
these
sketches
with
a
feeling
of
amazement
that
contained
revulsion
if
not
actually
horror
and
disgust
they
were
outrageous
i
felt
hot
for
my
sister
and
it
was
a
relief
to
know
she
had
moved
across
the
room
on
some
pretence
or
other
and
did
not
examine
them
with
me
her
talent
of
course
is
mediocre
yet
she
has
her
moments
of
inspiration
moments
that
is
to
say
when
a
view
of
beauty
not
normally
her
own
flames
divinely
through
her
and
these
interpretations
struck
me
forcibly
as
being
thus
inspired
not
her
own
they
were
uncommonly
well
done
they
were
also
atrocious
the
meaning
in
them
however
was
never
more
than
hinted
there
the
unholy
skill
and
power
came
in
they
suggested
so
abominably
leaving
most
to
the
imagination
to
find
such
significance
in
a
bourgeois
villa
garden
and
to
interpret
it
with
such
delicate
yet
legible
certainty
was
a
kind
of
symbolism
that
was
sinister
even
diabolical
the
delicacy
was
her
own
but
the
point
of
view
was
another
and
the
word
that
rose
in
my
mind
was
not
the
gross
description
of
impure
but
the
more
fundamental
qualification
in
silence
i
turned
the
sketches
over
one
by
one
as
a
boy
hurries
through
the
pages
of
an
evil
book
lest
he
be
caught
what
does
mabel
do
with
them
i
asked
presently
in
a
low
tone
as
i
neared
the
end
does
she
keep
them
she
makes
notes
about
them
in
a
book
and
then
destroys
them
was
the
reply
from
the
end
of
the
room
i
heard
a
sigh
of
relief
i
glad
you
seen
them
bill
i
wanted
you
to
but
was
afraid
to
show
them
you
understand
i
understand
was
my
reply
though
it
was
not
a
question
intended
to
be
answered
all
i
understood
really
was
that
mabel
mind
was
as
sweet
and
pure
as
my
sister
and
that
she
had
some
good
reason
for
what
she
did
she
destroyed
the
sketches
but
first
made
notes
it
was
an
interpretation
of
the
place
she
sought
i
felt
resentment
though
that
frances
should
waste
her
time
and
talent
when
she
might
be
doing
work
that
she
could
sell
naturally
i
felt
other
things
as
well
mabel
pays
me
five
guineas
for
each
one
i
heard
absolutely
insists
i
stared
at
her
stupidly
a
moment
bereft
of
speech
or
wit
i
must
either
accept
or
go
away
she
went
on
calmly
but
a
little
white
i
tried
everything
there
was
a
scene
the
third
day
i
was
here
when
i
showed
her
my
first
result
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
hesitated
it
unintentional
then
on
your
part
forgive
my
asking
it
frances
dear
i
blundered
hardly
knowing
what
to
think
or
say
between
the
lines
of
her
letter
came
back
to
me
i
mean
you
make
the
sketches
in
your
ordinary
way
and
the
result
comes
out
of
itself
so
to
speak
she
nodded
throwing
her
hands
out
like
a
frenchman
we
need
keep
the
money
for
ourselves
bill
we
can
give
it
away
but
i
must
either
accept
or
leave
and
she
repeated
the
shrugging
gesture
she
sat
down
on
the
chair
facing
me
staring
helplessly
at
the
carpet
you
say
there
was
a
scene
i
went
on
presently
she
insisted
she
begged
me
to
continue
my
sister
replied
very
quietly
she
thinks
that
is
she
has
an
idea
or
theory
that
there
something
about
the
place
something
she
ca
get
at
quite
frances
stammered
badly
she
knew
i
did
not
encourage
her
wild
theories
something
she
feels
yes
i
helped
her
more
than
curious
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
bill
she
said
desperately
that
the
place
is
saturated
with
some
influence
that
she
is
herself
too
positive
or
too
stupid
to
interpret
she
trying
to
make
herself
negative
and
receptive
as
she
calls
it
but
ca
of
course
succeed
have
you
noticed
how
dull
and
impersonal
and
insipid
she
seems
as
though
she
had
no
personality
she
thinks
impressions
will
come
to
her
that
way
but
they
do
naturally
so
she
trying
me
us
what
she
calls
the
sensitive
and
impressionable
artistic
temperament
she
says
that
until
she
is
sure
exactly
what
this
influence
is
she
ca
fight
it
turn
it
out
the
house
straight
as
she
phrases
it
remembering
my
own
singular
impressions
i
felt
more
lenient
than
i
might
otherwise
have
done
i
tried
to
keep
impatience
out
of
my
voice
and
this
influence
what
whose
is
it
we
used
the
pronoun
that
followed
in
the
same
breath
for
i
answered
my
own
question
at
the
same
moment
as
she
did
his
our
heads
nodded
involuntarily
towards
the
floor
the
dining
room
being
directly
underneath
and
my
heart
sank
my
curiosity
died
away
on
the
instant
i
felt
bored
a
commonplace
haunted
house
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
to
amuse
or
interest
me
the
mere
thought
exasperated
with
its
suggestions
of
imagination
overwrought
nerves
hysteria
and
the
rest
mingled
with
my
other
feelings
was
certainly
disappointment
to
see
a
figure
or
feel
a
presence
and
report
from
day
to
day
strange
incidents
to
each
other
would
be
a
form
of
weariness
i
could
never
tolerate
but
really
frances
i
said
firmly
after
a
moment
pause
it
too
this
explanation
a
curse
you
know
belongs
to
the
ghost
stories
of
early
victorian
days
and
only
my
positive
conviction
that
there
was
something
after
all
worth
discovering
and
that
it
most
certainly
was
not
this
prevented
my
suggesting
that
we
terminate
our
visit
forthwith
or
as
soon
as
we
decently
could
this
is
not
a
haunted
house
whatever
it
is
i
concluded
somewhat
vehemently
bringing
my
hand
down
upon
her
odious
portfolio
my
sister
reply
revived
my
curiosity
sharply
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
say
that
mabel
says
exactly
the
same
he
is
in
it
but
it
something
more
than
that
alone
something
far
bigger
and
more
complicated
her
sentence
seemed
to
indicate
the
sketches
and
though
i
caught
the
inference
i
did
not
take
it
up
having
no
desire
to
discuss
them
with
her
just
them
indeed
if
ever
i
merely
stared
at
her
and
listened
questions
i
felt
sure
would
be
of
little
use
it
was
better
she
should
say
her
thought
in
her
own
way
he
is
one
influence
the
most
recent
she
went
on
slowly
and
always
very
calmly
but
there
are
others
deeper
layers
as
it
were
underneath
if
his
were
the
only
one
something
would
happen
but
nothing
ever
does
happen
the
others
hinder
and
prevent
as
though
each
were
struggling
to
predominate
i
had
felt
it
already
myself
the
idea
was
rather
horrible
i
shivered
that
what
is
so
ugly
about
it
that
nothing
ever
happens
she
said
there
is
this
endless
anticipation
always
on
the
dry
edge
of
a
result
that
never
materializes
it
is
torture
mabel
is
at
her
wits
end
you
see
and
when
she
begged
me
what
i
felt
about
my
sketches
i
mean
she
stammered
badly
as
before
i
stopped
her
i
had
judged
too
hastily
that
queer
symbolism
in
her
paintings
pagan
and
yet
not
innocent
was
i
understood
the
result
of
mixture
i
did
not
pretend
to
understand
but
at
least
i
could
be
patient
i
consequently
held
my
peace
we
did
talk
on
a
little
longer
but
it
was
more
general
talk
that
avoided
successfully
our
hostess
the
paintings
wild
theories
and
him
until
at
length
the
emotion
frances
had
hitherto
so
successfully
kept
under
burst
vehemently
forth
again
it
had
hidden
between
her
calm
sentences
as
it
had
hidden
between
the
lines
of
her
letter
it
swept
her
now
from
head
to
foot
packed
tight
in
the
thing
she
then
said
then
bill
if
it
is
not
an
ordinary
haunted
house
she
asked
what
is
it
the
words
were
commonplace
enough
the
emotion
was
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
trembled
in
the
gesture
she
made
leaning
forward
and
clasping
both
hands
upon
her
knees
and
in
the
slight
blanching
of
her
cheeks
as
her
brave
eyes
asked
the
question
and
searched
my
own
with
anxiety
that
bordered
upon
panic
in
that
moment
she
put
herself
under
my
protection
i
winced
and
why
she
added
lowering
her
voice
to
a
still
and
furtive
whisper
does
nothing
ever
happen
if
only
this
with
great
emphasis
something
would
happen
break
this
awful
tension
bring
relief
the
waiting
i
can
not
stand
and
she
shivered
all
over
as
she
said
it
a
touch
of
wildness
in
her
eyes
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
made
a
true
and
satisfactory
answer
my
mind
searched
frantically
for
a
moment
but
in
vain
there
lay
no
sufficient
answer
in
me
i
felt
what
she
felt
though
with
differences
no
conclusive
explanation
lay
within
reach
nothing
happened
eager
as
i
was
to
shoot
the
entire
business
into
the
rubbish
heap
where
ignorance
and
superstition
discharge
their
poisonous
weeds
i
could
not
honestly
accomplish
this
to
treat
frances
as
a
child
and
merely
explain
away
would
be
to
strain
her
confidence
in
my
protection
so
affectionately
claimed
it
would
further
be
dishonest
to
myself
weak
besides
to
deny
that
i
had
also
felt
the
strain
and
tension
even
as
she
did
while
my
mind
continued
searching
i
returned
her
stare
in
silence
and
frances
then
with
more
honesty
and
insight
than
my
own
gave
suddenly
the
answer
herself
an
answer
whose
truth
and
adequacy
so
far
as
they
went
i
could
not
readily
gainsay
i
think
bill
because
it
is
too
big
to
happen
here
to
happen
anywhere
indeed
all
at
once
and
too
awful
to
have
tossed
the
sentence
aside
as
nonsense
argued
it
away
proved
that
it
was
really
meaningless
would
have
been
easy
at
any
other
time
or
in
any
other
place
and
had
the
past
week
brought
me
none
of
the
vivid
impressions
it
had
brought
me
this
is
doubtless
what
i
should
have
done
my
narrowness
again
was
proved
we
understand
in
others
only
what
we
have
in
ourselves
but
her
explanation
in
a
measure
i
knew
was
true
it
hinted
at
the
strife
and
struggle
that
my
notion
of
a
shadow
had
seemed
to
cover
thinly
perhaps
i
murmured
lamely
waiting
in
vain
for
her
to
say
more
but
you
said
just
now
that
you
felt
the
thing
was
layers
as
it
were
do
you
mean
each
one
each
influence
fighting
for
the
upper
hand
i
used
her
phraseology
to
conceal
my
own
poverty
terminology
after
all
was
nothing
provided
we
could
reach
the
idea
itself
her
eyes
said
yes
she
had
her
clear
conception
arrived
at
independently
as
was
her
way
and
unlike
her
sex
she
kept
it
clear
unsmothered
by
too
many
words
one
set
of
influences
gets
at
me
another
gets
at
you
it
according
to
our
temperaments
i
think
she
glanced
significantly
at
the
vile
portfolio
sometimes
they
are
mixed
and
therefore
false
there
has
always
been
in
me
more
than
in
you
the
pagan
thing
perhaps
though
never
thank
god
like
that
the
frank
confession
of
course
invited
my
own
as
it
was
meant
to
do
yet
it
was
difficult
to
find
the
words
what
i
have
felt
in
this
place
frances
i
honestly
can
hardly
tell
you
because
er
my
impressions
have
not
arranged
themselves
in
any
definite
form
i
can
describe
the
strife
the
agony
of
escape
and
the
unrest
a
sort
of
prison
atmosphere
this
i
have
felt
at
different
times
and
with
varying
degrees
of
strength
but
i
find
as
yet
no
final
label
to
attach
i
could
say
pagan
christian
or
anything
like
that
i
mean
as
you
do
as
with
the
blind
and
deaf
you
may
have
an
intensification
of
certain
senses
denied
to
me
or
even
another
sense
altogether
in
embryo
perhaps
she
stopped
me
anxious
to
keep
to
the
point
you
feel
it
as
mabel
does
she
feels
the
whole
thing
complete
that
also
is
possible
i
said
very
slowly
i
was
thinking
behind
my
words
her
odd
remark
that
it
was
big
and
awful
came
back
upon
me
as
true
a
vast
sensation
of
distress
and
discomfort
swept
me
suddenly
pity
was
in
it
and
a
fierce
contempt
a
savage
bitter
anger
as
well
fury
against
some
sham
authority
was
part
of
it
frances
i
said
caught
unawares
and
dropping
all
pretence
what
in
the
world
can
it
be
i
looked
hard
at
her
for
some
minutes
neither
of
us
spoke
have
you
felt
no
desire
to
interpret
it
she
asked
presently
mabel
did
suggest
my
writing
something
about
the
house
was
my
reply
but
i
felt
nothing
imperative
that
sort
of
writing
is
not
my
line
you
know
my
only
feeling
i
added
noticing
that
she
waited
for
more
is
the
impulse
to
explain
discover
get
it
out
of
me
somehow
and
so
get
rid
of
it
not
by
writing
though
as
yet
and
again
i
repeated
my
former
question
what
in
the
world
do
you
think
it
is
my
voice
had
become
involuntarily
hushed
there
was
awe
in
it
her
answer
given
with
slow
emphasis
brought
back
all
my
reserve
the
phraseology
provoked
me
rather
whatever
it
is
bill
it
is
not
of
god
i
got
up
to
go
downstairs
i
believe
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
would
you
like
to
leave
frances
shall
we
go
back
to
town
i
suggested
this
at
the
door
and
hearing
no
immediate
reply
i
turned
back
to
look
frances
was
sitting
with
her
head
bowed
over
and
buried
in
her
hands
the
attitude
horribly
suggested
tears
no
woman
i
realized
can
keep
back
the
pressure
of
strong
emotion
as
long
as
frances
had
done
without
ending
in
a
fluid
collapse
i
waited
a
moment
uneasily
longing
to
comfort
yet
afraid
to
act
and
in
this
way
discovered
the
existence
of
the
appalling
emotion
in
myself
hitherto
but
half
guessed
at
all
costs
a
scene
must
be
prevented
it
would
involve
such
exaggeration
and
overstatement
brutally
such
is
the
weakness
of
the
ordinary
man
i
turned
the
handle
to
go
out
but
my
sister
then
raised
her
head
the
sunlight
caught
her
face
framed
untidily
in
its
auburn
hair
and
i
saw
her
wonderful
expression
with
a
start
pity
tenderness
and
sympathy
shone
in
it
like
a
flame
it
was
undeniable
there
shone
through
all
her
features
the
imperishable
love
and
yearning
to
sacrifice
self
for
others
which
i
have
seen
in
only
one
type
of
human
being
it
was
the
great
mother
look
we
must
stay
by
mabel
and
help
her
get
it
straight
she
whispered
making
the
decision
for
us
both
i
murmured
agreement
abashed
and
half
ashamed
i
stole
softly
from
the
room
and
went
out
into
the
grounds
and
the
first
thing
clearly
realized
when
alone
was
this
that
the
long
scene
between
us
was
without
definite
result
the
exchange
of
confidence
was
really
nothing
but
hints
and
vague
suggestion
we
had
decided
to
stay
but
it
was
a
negative
decision
not
to
leave
rather
than
a
positive
action
all
our
words
and
questions
our
guesses
inferences
explanations
our
most
subtle
allusions
and
insinuations
even
the
odious
paintings
themselves
were
without
definite
result
nothing
had
happened
chapter
vi
and
instinctively
once
alone
i
made
for
the
places
where
she
had
painted
her
extraordinary
pictures
i
tried
to
see
what
she
had
seen
perhaps
now
that
she
had
opened
my
mind
to
another
view
i
should
be
sensitive
to
some
similar
interpretation
and
possibly
by
way
of
literary
expression
if
i
were
to
write
about
the
place
i
asked
myself
how
should
i
treat
it
i
deliberately
invited
an
interpretation
in
the
way
that
came
easiest
to
me
writing
but
in
this
case
there
came
no
such
revelation
looking
closely
at
the
trees
and
flowers
the
bits
of
lawn
and
terrace
the
and
corner
of
the
house
where
the
flaming
creeper
hung
so
thickly
i
discovered
nothing
of
the
odious
unpure
thing
her
color
and
grouping
had
unconsciously
revealed
at
first
that
is
i
discovered
nothing
the
reality
stood
there
commonplace
and
ugly
side
by
side
with
her
distorted
version
of
it
that
lay
in
my
mind
it
seemed
incredible
i
tried
to
force
it
but
in
vain
my
imagination
ploughed
less
deeply
than
hers
or
to
another
pattern
grew
different
seed
where
i
saw
the
gross
soul
of
an
overgrown
suburban
garden
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
a
vulgar
rich
revivalist
who
loved
to
preach
damnation
she
saw
this
rush
of
pagan
liberty
and
joy
this
strange
license
of
primitive
flesh
which
tainted
by
the
other
produced
the
adulterated
vile
result
certain
things
however
gradually
then
became
apparent
forcing
themselves
upon
me
they
came
slowly
but
overwhelmingly
not
that
facts
had
changed
or
natural
details
altered
in
the
grounds
this
was
impossible
but
that
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
various
aspects
i
had
not
noticed
before
trivial
enough
yet
for
me
just
then
significant
some
i
remembered
from
previous
days
others
i
saw
now
as
i
wandered
to
and
fro
uneasy
uncomfortable
almost
it
seemed
watched
by
some
one
who
took
note
of
my
impressions
the
details
were
so
foolish
the
total
result
so
formidable
i
was
half
aware
that
others
tried
hard
to
make
me
see
it
was
deliberate
my
sister
phrase
one
layer
got
at
me
another
gets
at
you
flashed
undesired
upon
me
for
i
saw
as
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
what
i
can
only
call
a
goblin
garden
house
grounds
trees
and
flowers
belonged
to
a
goblin
world
that
children
enter
through
the
pages
of
their
fairy
tales
and
what
made
me
first
aware
of
it
was
the
whisper
of
the
wind
behind
me
so
that
i
turned
with
a
sudden
start
feeling
that
something
had
moved
closer
an
old
ash
tree
ugly
and
ungainly
had
been
artificially
trained
to
form
an
arbor
at
one
end
of
the
terrace
that
was
a
tennis
lawn
and
the
leaves
of
it
now
went
rustling
together
swishing
as
they
rose
and
fell
i
looked
at
the
ash
tree
and
felt
as
though
i
had
passed
that
moment
between
doors
into
this
goblin
garden
that
crouched
behind
the
real
one
below
at
a
deeper
layer
perhaps
lay
hidden
the
one
my
sister
had
entered
to
deal
with
my
own
however
i
call
it
goblin
because
an
odd
aspect
of
the
quaint
in
it
yet
never
quite
achieved
the
picturesque
grotesque
probably
is
the
truer
word
for
everywhere
i
noticed
and
for
the
first
time
this
slight
alteration
of
the
natural
due
either
to
the
exaggeration
of
some
detail
or
to
its
suppression
generally
i
think
to
the
latter
life
everywhere
appeared
to
me
as
blocked
from
the
full
delivery
of
its
sweet
and
lovely
message
some
counter
influence
stopped
it
suppression
or
sent
it
awry
exaggeration
the
house
itself
mere
expression
of
course
of
a
narrow
limited
mind
was
sheer
ugliness
it
required
no
further
explanation
with
the
grounds
and
garden
so
far
as
shape
and
general
plan
were
concerned
this
was
also
true
but
that
trees
and
flowers
and
other
natural
details
should
share
the
same
deficiency
perplexed
my
logical
soul
and
even
dismayed
it
i
stood
and
stared
then
moved
about
and
stood
and
stared
again
everywhere
was
this
mockery
of
a
sinister
unfinished
aspect
i
sought
in
vain
to
recover
my
normal
point
of
view
my
mind
had
found
this
goblin
garden
and
wandered
to
and
fro
in
it
unable
to
escape
the
change
was
in
myself
of
course
and
so
trivial
were
the
details
which
illustrated
it
that
they
sound
absurd
thus
mentioned
one
by
one
for
me
they
proved
it
is
all
i
can
affirm
the
goblin
touch
lay
plainly
everywhere
in
the
forms
of
the
trees
planted
at
neat
intervals
along
the
lawns
in
this
twisted
ash
that
rustled
just
behind
me
in
the
shadow
of
the
gloomy
wellingtonias
whose
sweeping
skirts
obscured
the
grass
but
especially
i
noticed
in
the
tops
and
crests
of
them
for
here
the
delicate
graceful
curves
of
last
year
growth
seemed
to
shrink
back
into
themselves
none
of
them
pointed
upwards
their
life
had
failed
and
turned
aside
just
when
it
should
have
become
triumphant
the
character
of
a
tree
reveals
itself
chiefly
at
the
extremities
and
it
was
precisely
here
that
they
all
drooped
and
achieved
this
hint
of
goblin
distortion
in
the
growth
that
is
of
the
last
few
years
what
ought
to
have
been
fairy
joyful
natural
was
instead
uncomely
to
the
verge
of
the
grotesque
spontaneous
expression
was
arrested
my
mind
perceived
a
goblin
garden
and
was
caught
in
it
the
place
grimaced
at
me
with
the
flowers
it
was
similar
though
far
more
difficult
to
detect
in
detail
for
description
i
saw
the
smaller
vegetable
growth
as
impish
even
the
terraces
sloped
ill
as
though
their
ends
had
sagged
since
they
had
been
so
lavishly
constructed
their
varying
angles
gave
a
queerly
bewildering
aspect
to
their
sequence
that
was
unpleasant
to
the
eye
one
might
wander
among
their
deceptive
lengths
and
get
lost
lost
among
open
terraces
with
the
house
quite
close
at
hand
unhomely
seemed
the
entire
garden
unable
to
give
repose
restlessness
in
it
everywhere
almost
strife
and
discord
certainly
moreover
the
garden
grew
into
the
house
the
house
into
the
garden
and
in
both
was
this
idea
of
resistance
to
the
natural
the
spirit
that
says
no
to
joy
all
over
it
i
was
aware
of
the
effort
to
achieve
another
end
the
struggle
to
burst
forth
and
escape
into
free
spontaneous
expression
that
should
be
happy
and
natural
yet
the
effort
forever
frustrated
by
the
weight
of
this
dark
shadow
that
rendered
it
abortive
life
crawled
aside
into
a
channel
that
was
a
then
turned
horribly
upon
itself
instead
of
blossom
and
fruit
there
were
weeds
this
approach
of
life
i
was
conscious
of
then
dismal
failure
there
was
no
fulfillment
nothing
happened
and
so
through
this
singular
mood
i
came
a
little
nearer
to
understand
the
unpure
thing
that
had
stammered
out
into
expression
through
my
sister
talent
for
the
unpure
is
merely
negative
it
has
no
existence
it
is
but
the
cramped
expression
of
what
is
true
stammering
its
way
brokenly
over
false
boundaries
that
seek
to
limit
and
confine
great
full
expression
of
anything
is
pure
whereas
here
was
only
the
incomplete
unfinished
and
therefore
ugly
there
was
a
strife
and
pain
and
desire
to
escape
i
found
myself
shrinking
from
house
and
grounds
as
one
shrinks
from
the
touch
of
the
mentally
arrested
those
in
whom
life
has
turned
awry
there
was
almost
mutilation
in
it
past
items
too
now
flocked
to
confirm
this
feeling
that
i
walked
liberty
captured
and
in
a
monstrous
garden
i
remembered
days
of
rain
that
refreshed
the
countryside
but
left
these
grounds
cracked
with
the
summer
heat
unsatisfied
and
thirsty
and
how
the
big
winds
that
cleaned
the
woods
and
fields
elsewhere
crawled
here
with
difficulty
through
the
dense
foliage
that
protected
the
towers
from
the
north
and
west
and
east
they
were
ineffective
sluggish
currents
there
was
no
real
wind
nothing
happened
i
began
to
realize
far
more
clearly
than
in
my
sister
fanciful
explanation
about
layers
that
here
were
many
contrary
influences
at
work
mutually
destructive
of
one
another
house
and
grounds
were
not
haunted
merely
they
were
the
arena
of
past
thinking
and
feeling
perhaps
of
terrible
impure
beliefs
each
striving
to
suppress
the
others
yet
no
one
of
them
achieving
supremacy
because
no
one
of
them
was
strong
enough
no
one
of
them
was
true
each
moreover
tried
to
win
me
over
though
only
one
was
able
to
reach
my
mind
at
all
for
some
obscure
reason
possibly
because
my
temperament
had
a
natural
bias
towards
the
grotesque
it
was
the
goblin
layer
with
me
it
was
the
line
of
least
resistance
in
my
own
thoughts
this
goblin
garden
revealed
of
course
merely
my
personal
interpretation
i
felt
now
objectively
what
long
ago
my
mind
had
felt
subjectively
my
work
essential
sign
of
spontaneous
life
with
me
had
stopped
dead
production
had
become
impossible
i
stood
now
considerably
closer
to
the
cause
of
this
sterility
the
cause
rather
turned
bolder
had
stepped
insolently
nearer
nothing
happened
anywhere
house
garden
mind
alike
were
barren
abortive
torn
by
the
strife
of
frustrate
impulse
ugly
hateful
sinful
yet
behind
it
all
was
still
the
desire
of
life
desire
to
escape
accomplish
hope
an
intolerable
hope
i
became
startlingly
aware
crowned
torture
and
realizing
this
though
in
some
part
of
me
where
reason
lost
her
hold
there
rose
upon
me
then
another
and
a
darker
thing
that
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
made
me
shrink
with
a
sense
of
revulsion
that
touched
actual
loathing
i
knew
instantly
whence
it
came
this
wave
of
abhorrence
and
disgust
for
even
while
i
saw
red
and
felt
revolt
rise
in
me
it
seemed
that
i
grew
partially
aware
of
the
layer
next
below
the
goblin
i
perceived
the
existence
of
this
deeper
stratum
one
opened
the
way
for
the
other
as
it
were
there
were
so
many
yet
all
to
admit
one
was
to
clear
the
way
for
all
if
i
lingered
i
should
be
caught
horribly
they
struggled
with
such
violence
for
supremacy
among
themselves
however
that
this
latest
uprising
was
instantly
smothered
and
crushed
back
though
not
before
a
glimpse
had
been
revealed
to
me
and
the
redness
in
my
thoughts
transferred
itself
to
color
my
surroundings
thickly
and
appallingly
with
blood
this
lurid
aspect
drenched
the
garden
smeared
the
terraces
lent
to
the
very
soil
a
tinge
as
of
sacrificial
rites
that
choked
the
breath
in
me
while
it
seemed
to
fix
me
to
the
earth
my
feet
so
longed
to
leave
it
was
so
revolting
that
at
the
same
time
i
felt
a
dreadful
curiosity
as
of
fascination
i
wished
to
stay
between
these
contrary
impulses
i
think
i
actually
reeled
a
moment
transfixed
by
a
fascination
of
the
awful
through
the
lighter
goblin
veil
i
felt
myself
sinking
down
down
down
into
this
turgid
layer
that
was
so
much
more
violent
and
so
much
more
ancient
the
upper
layer
indeed
seemed
fairy
by
comparison
with
this
terror
born
of
the
lust
for
blood
thick
with
the
anguish
of
human
sacrificial
victims
upper
then
i
was
already
sinking
my
feet
were
caught
i
was
actually
in
it
what
atavistic
strain
hidden
deep
within
me
had
been
touched
into
vile
response
giving
this
flash
of
intuitive
comprehension
i
can
not
say
the
coatings
laid
on
by
civilization
are
probably
thin
enough
in
all
of
us
i
made
a
supreme
effort
the
sun
and
wind
came
back
i
could
almost
swear
i
opened
my
eyes
something
very
atrocious
surged
back
into
the
depths
carrying
with
it
a
thought
of
tangled
woods
of
big
stones
standing
in
a
circle
motionless
white
figures
the
one
form
bound
with
ropes
and
the
ghastly
gleam
of
the
knife
like
smoke
upon
a
battlefield
it
rolled
away
i
was
standing
on
the
gravel
path
below
the
second
terrace
when
the
familiar
goblin
garden
danced
back
again
doubly
grotesque
now
doubly
mocking
yet
by
way
of
contrast
almost
welcome
my
glimpse
into
the
depths
was
momentary
it
seems
and
had
passed
utterly
away
the
common
world
rushed
back
with
a
sense
of
glad
relief
yet
ominous
now
forever
i
felt
for
the
knowledge
of
what
its
past
had
built
upon
in
street
in
theater
in
the
festivities
of
friends
in
or
playing
field
even
indeed
in
church
how
could
the
memory
of
what
i
had
seen
and
felt
leave
its
hideous
trace
the
very
structure
of
my
thought
it
seemed
to
me
was
stained
what
has
been
thought
by
others
can
never
be
obliterated
until
with
a
start
my
reverie
broke
and
fled
scattered
by
a
violent
sound
that
i
recognized
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
as
wholly
desirable
the
returning
motor
meant
that
my
hostess
was
back
yet
so
urgent
had
been
my
temporary
obsession
that
my
first
presentation
of
her
was
well
not
as
i
knew
her
now
floating
along
with
a
face
of
anguished
torture
i
saw
mabel
a
mere
effigy
captured
by
others
thinking
pass
down
into
those
depths
of
fire
and
blood
that
only
just
had
closed
beneath
my
feet
she
dipped
away
she
vanished
her
fading
eyes
turned
to
the
last
towards
some
savior
who
had
failed
her
and
that
strange
intolerable
hope
was
in
her
face
the
mystery
of
the
place
was
pretty
thick
about
me
just
then
it
was
the
fall
of
dusk
and
the
ghost
of
slanting
sunshine
was
as
unreal
as
though
badly
painted
the
garden
stood
at
attention
all
about
me
i
can
not
explain
it
but
i
can
tell
it
i
think
exactly
as
it
happened
for
it
remains
vivid
in
me
forever
that
for
the
first
time
something
almost
happened
myself
apparently
the
combining
link
through
which
it
pressed
towards
delivery
i
had
already
turned
towards
the
house
in
my
mind
were
pictures
not
actual
thoughts
of
the
motor
tea
on
the
verandah
my
sister
mabel
when
there
came
behind
me
this
tumultuous
awful
rush
as
i
left
the
garden
the
ugliness
the
pain
the
striving
to
escape
the
whole
negative
and
suppressed
agony
that
was
the
place
focused
that
second
into
a
concentrated
effort
to
produce
a
result
it
was
a
blinding
tempest
of
desire
that
heaved
at
me
surging
appallingly
behind
me
like
an
anguished
mob
i
was
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
frontier
into
my
normal
self
again
when
it
came
catching
fearfully
at
my
skirts
i
might
use
an
entire
dictionary
of
descriptive
adjectives
yet
come
no
nearer
to
it
than
this
the
conception
of
a
huge
assemblage
determined
to
escape
with
me
or
to
snatch
me
back
among
themselves
my
legs
trembled
for
an
instant
and
i
caught
my
breath
then
turned
and
ran
as
fast
as
possible
up
the
ugly
terraces
at
the
same
instant
as
though
the
clanging
of
an
iron
gate
cut
short
the
unfinished
phrase
i
thought
the
beginning
of
an
awful
thing
the
damned
like
this
it
rushed
after
me
from
that
goblin
garden
that
had
sought
to
keep
me
the
damned
for
there
was
sound
in
it
i
know
full
well
it
was
subjective
not
actually
heard
at
all
yet
somehow
sound
was
in
it
a
great
volume
roaring
and
booming
thunderously
far
away
and
below
me
the
sentence
dipped
back
into
the
depths
that
gave
it
birth
unfinished
its
completion
was
prevented
as
usual
nothing
happened
but
it
drove
behind
me
like
a
hurricane
as
i
ran
towards
the
house
and
the
sound
of
it
i
can
only
liken
to
those
terrible
undertones
you
may
hear
standing
beside
niagara
they
lie
behind
the
mere
crash
of
the
falling
flood
within
it
somehow
not
audible
to
all
felt
rather
than
definitely
heard
it
seemed
to
echo
back
from
the
surface
of
those
sagging
terraces
as
i
flew
across
their
sloping
ends
for
it
was
somehow
underneath
them
it
was
in
the
rustle
of
the
wind
that
stirred
the
skirts
of
the
drooping
wellingtonias
the
beds
of
formal
flowers
passed
it
on
to
the
creepers
red
as
blood
that
crept
over
the
unsightly
building
into
the
structure
of
the
vulgar
and
forbidding
house
it
sank
away
the
towers
took
it
home
the
uncomely
doors
and
windows
seemed
almost
like
mouths
that
had
uttered
the
words
themselves
and
on
the
upper
floors
at
that
very
moment
i
saw
two
maids
in
the
act
of
closing
them
again
and
on
the
verandah
as
i
arrived
breathless
and
shaken
in
my
soul
frances
and
mabel
standing
by
the
tea
table
looked
up
to
greet
me
in
the
faces
of
both
were
clearly
legible
the
signs
of
shock
they
watched
me
coming
yet
so
full
of
their
own
distress
that
they
hardly
noticed
the
state
in
which
i
came
in
the
face
of
my
hostess
however
i
read
another
and
a
bigger
thing
than
in
the
face
of
frances
mabel
knew
she
had
experienced
what
i
had
experienced
she
had
heard
that
awful
sentence
i
had
heard
but
heard
it
not
for
the
first
time
heard
it
moreover
i
verily
believe
complete
and
to
its
dreadful
end
bill
did
you
hear
that
curious
noise
just
now
frances
asked
it
sharply
before
i
could
say
a
word
her
manner
was
confused
she
looked
straight
at
me
and
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
she
could
not
hide
there
wind
about
i
said
wind
in
the
trees
and
sweeping
round
the
walls
it
risen
rather
suddenly
my
voice
faltered
rather
no
it
was
wind
she
insisted
with
a
significance
meant
for
me
alone
but
badly
hidden
it
was
more
like
distant
thunder
we
thought
how
you
ran
too
she
added
what
a
pace
you
came
across
the
terraces
i
knew
instantly
from
the
way
she
said
it
that
they
both
had
already
heard
the
sound
before
and
were
anxious
to
know
if
i
had
heard
it
and
how
my
interpretation
was
what
they
sought
it
was
a
curiously
deep
sound
i
admit
it
may
have
been
big
guns
at
sea
i
suggested
forts
or
cruisers
practicing
the
coast
is
so
very
far
and
with
the
wind
in
the
right
direction
the
expression
on
mabel
face
stopped
me
dead
like
huge
doors
closing
she
said
softly
in
her
colorless
voice
enormous
metal
doors
shutting
against
a
mass
of
people
clamoring
to
get
out
the
gravity
the
note
of
hopelessness
in
her
tones
was
shocking
frances
had
gone
into
the
house
the
instant
mabel
began
to
speak
cold
she
had
said
i
think
i
get
a
shawl
mabel
and
i
were
alone
i
believe
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
been
really
alone
since
i
arrived
she
looked
up
from
the
teacups
fixing
her
pallid
eyes
on
mine
she
had
made
a
question
of
the
sentence
you
hear
it
like
that
i
asked
innocently
i
purposely
used
the
present
tense
she
changed
her
stare
from
one
eye
to
the
other
it
was
absolutely
expressionless
my
sister
step
sounded
on
the
floor
of
the
room
behind
us
if
only
mabel
began
then
stopped
and
my
own
feelings
leaping
out
instinctively
completed
the
sentence
i
felt
was
in
her
mind
something
would
happen
she
instantly
corrected
me
i
had
caught
her
thought
yet
somehow
phrased
it
wrongly
we
could
escape
she
lowered
her
tone
a
little
saying
it
hurriedly
the
we
amazed
and
horrified
me
but
something
in
her
voice
and
manner
struck
me
utterly
dumb
there
was
ice
and
terror
in
it
it
was
a
dying
woman
speaking
a
lost
and
hopeless
soul
in
that
atrocious
moment
i
hardly
noticed
what
was
said
exactly
but
i
remember
that
my
sister
returned
with
a
grey
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
that
mabel
said
in
her
ordinary
voice
again
it
is
chilly
yes
let
have
tea
inside
and
that
two
maids
one
of
them
the
grenadier
speedily
carried
the
loaded
trays
into
the
and
put
a
match
to
the
logs
in
the
great
open
fireplace
it
was
after
all
foolish
to
risk
the
sharp
evening
air
for
dusk
was
falling
steadily
and
even
the
sunshine
of
the
day
just
fading
could
not
turn
autumn
into
summer
i
was
the
last
to
come
in
just
as
i
left
the
verandah
a
large
black
bird
swooped
down
in
front
of
me
past
the
pillars
it
dropped
from
overhead
swerved
abruptly
to
one
side
as
it
caught
sight
of
me
and
flapped
heavily
towards
the
shrubberies
on
the
left
of
the
terraces
where
it
disappeared
into
the
gloom
it
flew
very
low
very
close
and
it
startled
me
i
think
because
in
some
way
it
seemed
like
my
shadow
materialized
as
though
the
dark
horror
that
was
rising
everywhere
from
house
and
garden
then
settling
back
so
thickly
yet
so
imperceptibly
upon
us
all
were
incarnated
in
that
whirring
creature
that
passed
between
the
daylight
and
the
coming
night
i
stood
a
moment
wondering
if
it
would
appear
again
before
i
followed
the
others
indoors
and
as
i
was
in
the
act
of
closing
the
windows
after
me
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
on
the
lawn
it
was
some
distance
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
shrubberies
in
fact
where
the
bird
had
vanished
but
in
spite
of
the
twilight
that
half
magnified
half
obscured
it
the
identity
was
unmistakable
i
knew
the
stiff
walk
too
well
to
be
deceived
marsh
taking
the
air
i
said
to
myself
i
felt
the
necessity
of
saying
it
and
i
wondered
why
she
was
doing
so
at
this
particular
hour
if
i
had
other
thoughts
they
were
so
vague
and
so
quickly
and
utterly
suppressed
that
i
can
not
recall
them
sufficiently
to
relate
them
here
and
once
indoors
it
was
to
be
expected
that
there
would
come
explanation
discussion
conversation
at
any
rate
regarding
the
singular
noise
and
its
cause
some
uttered
evidence
of
the
mood
that
had
been
strong
enough
to
drive
us
all
inside
yet
there
was
none
each
of
us
purposely
and
with
various
skill
ignored
it
we
talked
little
and
when
we
did
it
was
of
anything
in
the
world
but
that
personally
i
experienced
a
touch
of
that
same
bewilderment
which
had
come
over
me
during
my
first
talk
with
frances
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
for
i
recall
now
the
acute
tension
and
the
hope
yet
dread
that
one
or
other
of
us
must
sooner
or
later
introduce
the
subject
it
did
not
happen
however
no
reference
was
made
to
it
even
remotely
it
was
the
presence
of
mabel
i
felt
positive
that
prohibited
as
soon
might
we
have
discussed
death
in
the
bedroom
of
a
dying
woman
the
only
scrap
of
conversation
i
remember
where
all
was
ordinary
and
commonplace
was
when
mabel
spoke
casually
to
the
grenadier
asking
why
marsh
had
omitted
to
do
something
or
other
what
it
was
i
forget
and
that
the
maid
replied
respectfully
that
marsh
was
very
sorry
but
her
still
pained
her
i
enquired
though
so
casually
that
i
scarcely
know
what
prompted
the
words
whether
she
had
injured
herself
severely
and
the
reply
she
upset
a
lamp
and
burnt
herself
was
said
in
a
tone
that
made
me
feel
my
curiosity
was
indiscreet
but
she
always
has
an
excuse
for
not
doing
things
she
ought
to
do
the
little
bit
of
conversation
remained
with
me
and
i
remember
particularly
the
quick
way
frances
interrupted
and
turned
the
talk
upon
the
delinquencies
of
servants
in
general
telling
incidents
of
her
own
at
our
flat
with
a
volubility
that
perhaps
seemed
forced
and
that
certainly
did
not
encourage
general
talk
as
it
may
have
been
intended
to
do
we
lapsed
into
silence
immediately
she
finished
but
for
all
our
care
and
all
our
calculated
silence
each
knew
that
something
had
in
these
last
moments
come
very
close
it
had
brushed
us
in
passing
it
had
retired
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
now
that
the
large
dark
thing
i
saw
riding
the
dusk
probably
bird
of
prey
was
in
some
sense
a
symbol
of
it
in
my
mind
that
actually
there
had
been
no
bird
at
all
i
mean
but
that
my
mood
of
apprehension
and
dismay
had
formed
the
vivid
picture
in
my
thoughts
it
had
swept
past
us
it
had
retreated
but
it
was
now
at
this
moment
in
hiding
very
close
and
it
was
watching
us
perhaps
too
it
was
mere
coincidence
that
i
encountered
marsh
his
housekeeper
several
times
that
evening
in
the
short
interval
between
tea
and
dinner
and
that
on
each
occasion
the
sight
of
this
gaunt
woman
fed
my
prejudice
against
her
once
on
my
way
to
the
telephone
i
ran
into
her
just
where
the
passage
is
somewhat
jammed
by
a
square
table
carrying
the
chinese
gong
a
grandfather
clock
and
a
box
of
croquet
mallets
we
both
gave
way
then
both
advanced
then
again
gave
way
simultaneously
it
seemed
impossible
to
pass
we
stepped
with
decision
to
the
same
side
finally
colliding
in
the
middle
while
saying
those
futile
little
things
half
apology
half
excuse
that
are
inevitable
at
such
times
in
the
end
she
stood
upright
against
the
wall
for
me
to
pass
taking
her
place
against
the
very
door
i
wished
to
open
it
was
ludicrous
excuse
me
i
was
just
going
in
to
telephone
i
explained
and
she
sidled
off
murmuring
apologies
but
opening
the
door
for
me
while
she
did
so
our
hands
met
a
moment
on
the
handle
there
was
a
second
awkwardness
it
was
too
stupid
i
remembered
her
injury
and
by
way
of
something
to
say
i
enquired
after
it
she
thanked
me
it
was
entirely
healed
now
but
it
might
have
been
much
worse
and
there
was
something
about
the
mercy
of
the
lord
that
i
did
quite
catch
while
telephoning
however
london
call
and
my
attention
focused
on
it
realized
sharply
that
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
spoken
with
her
also
that
i
had
touched
her
it
happened
to
be
a
sunday
and
the
lines
were
clear
i
got
my
connection
quickly
and
the
incident
was
forgotten
while
my
thoughts
went
up
to
london
on
my
way
upstairs
then
the
woman
came
back
into
my
mind
so
that
i
recalled
other
things
about
her
how
she
seemed
all
over
the
house
in
unlikely
places
often
how
i
had
caught
her
sitting
in
the
hall
alone
that
night
how
she
was
forever
coming
and
going
with
her
lugubrious
visage
and
that
untidy
hair
at
the
back
that
had
made
me
laugh
three
years
ago
with
the
idea
that
it
looked
singed
or
burnt
and
how
the
impression
on
my
first
arrival
at
the
towers
was
that
this
woman
somehow
kept
alive
though
its
evidence
was
outwardly
suppressed
the
influence
of
her
late
employer
and
of
his
somber
teachings
somewhere
with
her
was
associated
the
idea
of
punishment
vindictiveness
revenge
i
remembered
again
suddenly
my
odd
notion
that
she
sought
to
keep
her
present
mistress
here
a
prisoner
in
this
bleak
and
comfortless
house
and
that
really
in
spite
of
her
obsequious
silence
she
was
intensely
opposed
to
the
change
of
thought
that
had
reclaimed
mabel
to
a
happier
view
of
life
all
this
in
a
passing
second
flashed
in
review
before
me
and
i
discovered
or
at
any
rate
reconstructed
the
real
marsh
she
was
decidedly
in
the
shadow
more
she
stood
in
the
forefront
of
it
stealthily
leading
an
assault
as
it
were
against
the
towers
and
its
occupants
as
though
consciously
or
unconsciously
she
labored
incessantly
to
this
hateful
end
i
can
only
judge
that
some
state
of
nervousness
in
me
permitted
the
series
of
insignificant
thoughts
to
assume
this
dramatic
shape
and
that
what
had
gone
before
prepared
the
way
and
led
her
up
at
the
head
of
so
formidable
a
procession
i
relate
it
exactly
as
it
came
to
me
my
nerves
were
doubtless
somewhat
on
edge
by
now
otherwise
i
should
hardly
have
been
a
prey
to
the
exaggeration
at
all
i
seemed
open
to
so
many
strange
impressions
nothing
else
perhaps
can
explain
my
ridiculous
conversation
with
her
when
for
the
third
time
that
evening
i
came
suddenly
upon
the
woman
down
the
stairs
standing
by
an
open
window
as
if
in
the
act
of
listening
she
was
dressed
in
black
a
black
shawl
over
her
square
shoulders
and
black
gloves
on
her
big
broad
hands
two
black
objects
prayer
books
apparently
she
clasped
and
on
her
head
she
wore
a
bonnet
with
shaking
beads
of
jet
at
first
i
did
not
know
her
as
i
came
running
down
upon
her
from
the
landing
it
was
only
when
she
stood
aside
to
let
me
pass
that
i
saw
her
profile
against
the
tapestry
and
recognized
marsh
and
to
catch
her
on
the
front
stairs
dressed
like
this
struck
me
as
incongruous
impertinent
i
paused
in
my
dangerous
descent
through
the
opened
window
came
the
sound
of
bells
church
bells
a
sound
more
depressing
to
me
than
superstition
and
as
nauseating
though
the
action
was
ill
judged
i
obeyed
the
sudden
prompting
was
it
a
secret
desire
to
attack
perhaps
and
spoke
to
her
been
to
church
i
suppose
mrs
marsh
i
said
or
just
going
perhaps
her
face
as
she
looked
up
a
second
to
reply
was
like
an
iron
doll
that
moved
its
lips
and
turned
its
eyes
but
made
no
other
imitation
of
life
at
all
some
of
us
still
goes
sir
she
said
unctuously
it
was
respectful
enough
yet
the
implied
judgment
of
the
rest
of
the
world
made
me
almost
angry
a
deferential
insolence
lay
behind
the
affected
meekness
for
those
who
believe
no
doubt
it
is
helpful
i
smiled
true
religion
brings
peace
and
happiness
i
sure
joy
marsh
joy
i
found
keen
satisfaction
in
the
emphasis
she
looked
at
me
like
a
knife
i
can
not
describe
the
implacable
thing
that
shone
in
her
fixed
stern
eyes
nor
the
shadow
of
felt
darkness
that
stole
across
her
face
she
glittered
i
felt
hate
in
her
i
knew
she
knew
too
who
was
in
the
thoughts
of
us
both
at
that
moment
she
replied
softly
never
forgetting
her
place
for
an
instant
there
is
joy
sir
in
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
and
in
church
there
goes
up
prayer
to
gawd
for
those
well
for
the
others
sir
she
cut
short
her
sentence
thus
the
gloom
about
her
as
she
said
it
was
like
the
gloom
about
a
hearse
a
tomb
a
darkness
of
great
hopeless
dungeons
my
tongue
ran
on
of
itself
with
a
kind
of
bitter
satisfaction
we
must
believe
there
are
no
others
marsh
salvation
you
know
would
be
such
a
failure
if
there
were
no
merciful
god
could
ever
have
devised
such
a
fearful
plan
her
voice
interrupting
me
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
they
rejected
the
salvation
when
it
was
offered
to
them
sir
on
earth
but
you
would
have
them
tortured
forever
because
of
one
mistake
in
ignorance
i
said
fixing
her
with
my
eye
come
now
would
you
marsh
no
god
worth
worshipping
could
permit
such
cruelty
think
a
moment
what
it
means
she
stared
at
me
a
curious
expression
in
her
stupid
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
woman
in
her
revolted
while
yet
she
dared
not
suffer
her
grim
belief
to
trip
that
is
she
would
willingly
have
had
it
otherwise
but
for
a
terror
that
prevented
we
may
pray
for
them
sir
and
we
do
we
may
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
carpet
good
good
i
put
in
cheerfully
sorry
now
that
i
had
spoken
at
all
that
more
hopeful
at
any
rate
is
it
she
murmured
something
about
abraham
bosom
and
the
time
of
salvation
not
being
forever
as
i
tried
to
pass
her
then
a
half
gesture
that
she
made
stopped
me
there
was
something
more
she
wished
to
say
to
ask
she
looked
up
furtively
in
her
eyes
i
saw
the
woman
peering
out
through
fear
sir
she
faltered
as
though
lightning
must
strike
her
dead
would
you
think
a
drop
of
cold
water
given
in
his
name
might
moisten
but
i
stopped
her
for
the
foolish
talk
had
lasted
long
enough
of
course
i
exclaimed
of
course
for
god
is
love
remember
and
love
means
charity
tolerance
sympathy
and
sparing
others
pain
and
i
hurried
past
her
determined
to
end
the
outrageous
conversation
for
which
yet
i
knew
myself
entirely
to
blame
behind
me
she
stood
for
several
minutes
half
bewildered
half
alarmed
as
i
suspected
i
caught
the
fragment
of
another
sentence
one
word
of
it
rather
punishment
but
the
rest
escaped
me
her
arrogance
and
condescending
tolerance
exasperated
me
while
i
was
at
the
same
time
secretly
pleased
that
i
might
have
touched
some
string
of
remorse
or
sympathy
in
her
after
all
her
belief
was
iron
she
dared
not
let
it
go
yet
somewhere
underneath
there
lurked
the
germ
of
a
wholesome
revulsion
she
would
help
them
if
she
dared
her
question
proved
it
half
ashamed
of
myself
i
turned
and
crossed
the
hall
quickly
lest
i
should
be
tempted
to
say
more
and
in
me
was
a
disagreeable
sensation
as
though
i
had
just
left
the
incurable
ward
of
some
great
hospital
a
reaction
caught
me
as
of
nausea
ugh
i
wanted
such
people
cleansed
by
fire
they
seemed
to
me
as
centers
of
contamination
whose
vicious
thoughts
flowed
out
to
stain
god
glorious
world
i
saw
myself
frances
mabel
too
especially
on
the
rack
while
that
odious
figure
of
cruelty
and
darkness
stood
over
us
and
ordered
the
awful
handles
turned
in
order
that
we
might
be
saved
forced
that
is
to
think
and
believe
exactly
as
she
thought
and
believed
i
found
relief
for
my
somewhat
childish
indignation
by
letting
myself
loose
upon
the
organ
then
the
flood
of
bach
and
beethoven
brought
back
the
sense
of
proportion
it
proved
however
at
the
same
time
that
there
had
been
this
growth
of
distortion
in
me
and
that
it
had
been
provided
apparently
by
my
closer
contact
for
the
first
time
with
that
funereal
personality
the
woman
who
like
her
master
believed
that
all
holding
views
of
god
that
differed
from
her
own
must
be
damned
eternally
it
gave
me
moreover
some
faint
clue
perhaps
though
a
clue
i
was
unequal
of
following
up
to
the
nature
of
the
strife
and
terror
and
frustrate
influence
in
the
house
that
housekeeper
had
to
do
with
it
she
kept
it
alive
her
thought
was
like
a
spell
she
waved
above
her
mistress
head
chapter
vii
that
night
i
was
wakened
by
a
hurried
tapping
at
my
door
and
before
i
could
answer
frances
stood
beside
my
bed
she
had
switched
on
the
light
as
she
came
in
her
hair
fell
straggling
over
her
dressing
gown
her
face
was
deathly
pale
its
expression
so
distraught
it
was
almost
haggard
the
eyes
were
very
wide
she
looked
almost
like
another
woman
she
was
whispering
at
a
great
pace
bill
bill
wake
up
quick
i
am
awake
what
is
it
i
whispered
too
i
was
startled
listen
was
all
she
said
her
eyes
stared
into
vacancy
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
great
house
the
wind
had
dropped
and
all
was
still
only
the
tapping
seemed
to
continue
endlessly
in
my
brain
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
pointed
to
two
i
heard
nothing
frances
what
is
it
i
rubbed
my
eyes
i
had
been
very
deeply
asleep
listen
she
repeated
very
softly
holding
up
one
finger
and
turning
her
eyes
towards
the
door
she
had
left
ajar
her
usual
calmness
had
deserted
her
she
was
in
the
grip
of
some
distressing
terror
for
a
full
minute
we
held
our
breath
and
listened
then
her
eyes
rolled
round
again
and
met
my
own
and
her
skin
went
even
whiter
than
before
it
woke
me
she
said
beneath
her
breath
and
moving
a
step
nearer
to
my
bed
it
was
the
noise
even
her
whisper
trembled
the
noise
the
word
repeated
itself
dully
of
its
own
accord
i
would
rather
it
had
been
anything
in
the
world
but
that
earthquake
foreign
cannon
collapse
of
the
house
above
our
heads
the
noise
frances
are
you
sure
i
was
playing
really
for
a
little
time
it
was
like
thunder
at
first
i
thought
it
was
thunder
but
a
minute
later
it
came
again
from
underground
it
appalling
she
muttered
the
words
her
voice
not
properly
under
control
there
was
a
pause
of
perhaps
a
minute
and
then
we
both
spoke
at
once
we
said
foolish
obvious
things
that
neither
of
us
believed
in
for
a
second
the
roof
had
fallen
in
there
were
burglars
downstairs
the
safes
had
been
blown
open
it
was
to
comfort
each
other
as
children
do
that
we
said
these
things
also
it
was
to
gain
further
time
there
some
one
in
the
house
of
course
i
heard
my
voice
say
finally
as
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
hurried
into
dressing
gown
and
slippers
do
be
alarmed
i
go
down
and
see
and
from
the
drawer
i
took
a
pistol
it
was
my
habit
to
carry
everywhere
with
me
i
loaded
it
carefully
while
frances
stood
beside
the
bed
and
watched
i
moved
towards
the
open
door
you
stay
here
frances
i
whispered
the
beating
of
my
heart
making
the
words
uneven
while
i
go
down
and
make
a
search
lock
yourself
in
girl
nothing
can
happen
to
you
it
was
downstairs
you
said
underneath
she
answered
faintly
pointing
through
the
floor
she
moved
suddenly
between
me
and
the
door
listen
hark
she
said
the
eyes
in
her
face
quite
fixed
it
coming
again
and
she
turned
her
head
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
i
stood
there
watching
her
and
while
i
watched
her
shook
but
nothing
stirred
from
the
halls
below
rose
only
the
whirr
and
quiet
ticking
of
the
numerous
clocks
the
blind
by
the
open
window
behind
us
flapped
out
a
little
into
the
room
as
the
draught
caught
it
i
come
with
you
bill
to
the
next
floor
she
broke
the
silence
then
i
stay
with
mabel
till
you
come
up
again
the
blind
sank
down
with
a
long
sigh
as
she
said
it
the
question
jumped
to
my
lips
before
i
could
repress
it
mabel
is
awake
she
heard
it
too
i
hardly
know
why
horror
caught
me
at
her
answer
all
was
so
vague
and
terrible
as
we
stood
there
playing
the
great
game
of
this
sinister
house
where
nothing
ever
happened
we
met
in
the
passage
she
was
on
her
way
to
me
what
shook
in
me
shook
inwardly
frances
i
mean
did
not
see
it
i
had
the
feeling
just
that
the
noise
was
upon
us
that
any
second
it
would
boom
and
roar
about
our
ears
but
the
deep
silence
held
i
only
heard
my
sister
little
whisper
coming
across
the
room
in
answer
to
my
question
then
what
is
mabel
doing
now
and
her
reply
proved
that
she
was
yielding
at
last
beneath
the
dreadful
tension
for
she
spoke
at
once
unable
longer
to
keep
up
the
pretence
with
a
kind
of
relief
as
it
were
she
said
it
out
looking
helplessly
at
me
like
a
child
she
is
weeping
and
gna
my
expression
must
have
stopped
her
i
believe
i
clapped
both
hands
upon
her
mouth
though
when
i
realized
things
clearly
again
i
found
they
were
covering
my
own
ears
instead
it
was
a
moment
of
unutterable
horror
the
revulsion
i
felt
was
actually
physical
it
would
have
given
me
pleasure
to
fire
off
all
the
five
chambers
of
my
pistol
into
the
air
above
my
head
the
sound
a
definite
wholesome
sound
that
explained
itself
would
have
been
a
positive
relief
other
feelings
though
were
in
me
too
all
over
me
rushing
to
and
fro
it
was
vain
to
seek
their
disentanglement
it
was
impossible
i
confess
that
i
experienced
among
them
a
touch
of
paralyzing
fear
though
for
a
moment
only
it
passed
as
sharply
as
it
came
leaving
me
with
a
violent
flush
of
blood
to
the
face
such
as
bursts
of
anger
bring
followed
abruptly
by
an
icy
perspiration
over
the
entire
body
yet
i
may
honestly
avow
that
it
was
not
ordinary
personal
fear
i
felt
nor
any
common
dread
of
physical
injury
it
was
rather
a
vast
impersonal
shrinking
a
sympathetic
shrinking
from
the
agony
and
terror
that
countless
others
somewhere
somehow
felt
for
themselves
the
first
sensation
of
a
prison
overwhelmed
me
in
that
instant
of
bitter
strife
and
frenzied
suffering
and
the
fiery
torture
of
the
yearning
to
escape
that
was
yet
hopelessly
uttered
it
was
of
incredible
power
it
was
real
the
vain
intolerable
hope
swept
over
me
i
mastered
myself
though
hardly
knowing
how
and
took
my
sister
hand
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
as
i
led
her
firmly
to
the
door
and
out
into
the
passage
apparently
she
noticed
nothing
of
my
so
near
collapse
for
i
caught
her
whisper
as
we
went
you
are
brave
bill
splendidly
brave
the
upper
corridors
of
the
great
sleeping
house
were
brightly
lit
on
her
way
to
me
she
had
turned
on
every
electric
switch
her
hand
could
reach
and
as
we
passed
the
final
flight
of
stairs
to
the
floor
below
i
heard
a
door
shut
softly
and
knew
that
mabel
had
been
listening
waiting
for
us
i
led
my
sister
up
to
it
she
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
an
inch
or
so
the
room
was
pitch
black
i
caught
no
glimpse
of
mabel
standing
there
frances
turned
to
me
with
a
hurried
whisper
billy
you
will
be
careful
wo
you
and
went
in
i
just
had
time
to
answer
that
i
would
not
be
long
and
frances
to
reply
you
find
us
here
when
the
door
closed
and
cut
her
sentence
short
before
its
end
but
it
was
not
alone
the
closing
door
that
took
the
final
words
frances
by
the
way
she
disappeared
i
knew
it
had
made
a
swift
and
violent
movement
into
the
darkness
that
was
as
though
she
sprang
she
leaped
upon
that
other
woman
who
stood
back
among
the
shadows
for
simultaneously
with
the
clipping
of
the
sentence
another
sound
was
also
stopped
stifled
smothered
choked
back
lest
i
should
also
hear
it
yet
not
in
time
i
heard
it
a
hard
and
horrible
sound
that
explained
both
the
leap
and
the
abrupt
cessation
of
the
whispered
words
i
stood
irresolute
a
moment
it
was
as
though
all
the
bones
had
been
withdrawn
from
my
body
so
that
i
must
sink
and
fall
that
sound
plucked
them
out
and
plucked
out
my
with
them
i
am
not
sure
that
it
was
a
sound
i
had
ever
heard
before
though
children
i
half
remembered
made
it
sometimes
in
blind
rages
when
they
knew
not
what
they
did
in
a
person
certainly
i
had
never
known
it
i
associated
it
with
animals
rather
horribly
in
the
history
of
the
world
no
doubt
it
has
been
common
enough
alas
but
fortunately
today
there
can
be
but
few
who
know
it
or
would
recognize
it
even
when
heard
the
bones
shot
back
into
my
body
the
same
instant
but
and
burning
the
brief
instant
of
irresolution
passed
i
was
torn
between
the
desire
to
break
down
the
door
and
enter
and
to
run
run
for
my
life
from
a
thing
i
dared
not
face
out
of
the
horrid
tumult
then
i
adopted
neither
course
without
reflection
certainly
without
analysis
of
what
was
best
to
do
for
my
sister
myself
or
mabel
i
took
up
my
action
where
it
had
been
interrupted
i
turned
from
the
awful
door
and
moved
slowly
towards
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
that
dreadful
little
sound
came
with
me
i
believe
my
own
teeth
chattered
it
seemed
all
over
the
house
in
the
empty
halls
that
opened
into
the
long
passages
towards
the
and
even
in
the
grounds
outside
the
building
from
the
lawns
and
barren
garden
from
the
ugly
terraces
themselves
it
rose
into
the
night
and
behind
it
came
a
curious
driving
sound
incomplete
unfinished
as
of
wailing
for
deliverance
the
wailing
of
desperate
souls
in
anguish
the
dull
and
dry
beseeching
of
hopeless
spirits
in
prison
that
i
could
have
taken
the
little
sound
from
the
bedroom
where
i
actually
heard
it
and
spread
it
thus
over
the
entire
house
and
grounds
is
evidence
perhaps
of
the
state
my
nerves
were
in
the
wailing
assuredly
was
in
my
mind
alone
but
the
longer
i
hesitated
the
more
difficult
became
my
task
and
gathering
up
my
dressing
gown
lest
i
should
trip
in
the
darkness
i
passed
slowly
down
the
staircase
into
the
hail
below
i
carried
neither
candle
nor
matches
every
switch
in
room
and
corridor
was
known
to
me
the
covering
of
darkness
was
indeed
rather
comforting
than
otherwise
for
if
it
prevented
seeing
it
also
prevented
being
seen
the
heavy
pistol
knocking
against
my
thigh
as
i
moved
made
me
feel
i
was
carrying
a
child
toy
foolishly
i
experienced
in
every
nerve
that
primitive
vast
dread
which
is
the
thrill
of
darkness
merely
the
child
in
me
was
comforted
by
that
pistol
the
night
was
not
entirely
black
the
iron
bars
across
the
glass
front
door
were
visible
and
equally
i
discerned
the
big
stiff
wooden
chairs
in
the
hall
the
gaping
fireplace
the
upright
pillars
supporting
the
staircase
the
round
table
in
the
center
with
its
books
and
and
the
basket
that
held
visitors
cards
there
too
was
the
stick
and
umbrella
stand
and
the
shelf
with
railway
guides
directory
and
telegraph
forms
clocks
ticked
everywhere
with
sounds
like
quiet
footfalls
light
fell
here
and
there
in
patches
from
the
floor
above
i
stood
a
moment
in
the
hall
letting
my
eyes
grow
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom
while
deciding
on
a
plan
of
search
i
made
out
the
ivy
trailing
outside
over
one
of
the
big
windows
and
then
the
tall
clock
by
the
front
door
made
a
grating
noise
deep
down
inside
its
body
it
was
the
presentation
clock
large
and
hideous
given
by
the
congregation
of
his
church
and
dreading
the
booming
strike
it
seemed
to
threaten
i
made
a
quick
decision
if
others
beside
myself
were
about
in
the
night
the
sound
of
that
striking
might
cover
their
approach
so
i
tiptoed
to
the
right
where
the
passage
led
towards
the
dining
room
in
the
other
direction
were
the
and
drawing
rooms
both
little
used
and
various
other
rooms
beyond
that
had
been
his
generally
now
kept
locked
i
thought
of
my
sister
waiting
upstairs
with
that
frightened
woman
for
my
return
i
went
quickly
yet
stealthily
and
to
my
surprise
the
door
of
the
dining
room
was
open
it
had
been
opened
i
paused
on
the
threshold
staring
about
me
i
think
i
fully
expected
to
see
a
figure
blocked
in
the
shadows
against
the
heavy
sideboard
or
looming
on
the
other
side
beneath
his
portrait
but
the
room
was
empty
i
felt
it
empty
through
the
wide
that
gave
on
to
the
verandah
came
an
uncertain
glimmer
that
even
shone
reflected
in
the
polished
surface
of
the
and
again
i
perceived
the
stiff
outline
of
chairs
waiting
tenantless
all
round
it
two
larger
ones
with
high
carved
backs
at
either
end
the
monkey
trees
on
the
upper
terrace
too
were
visible
outside
against
the
sky
and
the
solemn
crests
of
the
wellingtonias
on
the
terraces
below
the
enormous
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
very
slowly
as
though
its
machinery
were
running
down
and
i
made
out
the
pale
round
patch
that
was
its
face
resisting
my
first
inclination
to
turn
the
lights
up
my
hand
had
gone
so
far
as
to
finger
the
friendly
knob
i
crossed
the
room
so
carefully
that
no
single
board
creaked
nor
a
single
chair
as
i
rested
a
hand
upon
its
back
moved
on
the
parquet
flooring
i
turned
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
nor
did
i
once
look
back
i
went
towards
the
long
corridor
filled
with
priceless
that
led
through
various
antechambers
into
the
spacious
and
only
at
the
mouth
of
this
corridor
did
i
next
halt
a
moment
in
uncertainty
for
this
long
corridor
lit
faintly
by
high
windows
on
the
left
from
the
verandah
was
very
narrow
owing
to
the
mass
of
shelves
and
fancy
tables
it
contained
it
was
not
that
i
feared
to
knock
over
precious
things
as
i
went
but
that
because
of
its
ungenerous
width
there
would
be
no
room
to
pass
another
person
if
i
met
one
and
the
certainty
had
suddenly
come
upon
me
that
somewhere
in
this
corridor
another
person
at
this
actual
moment
stood
here
somehow
amid
all
this
dead
atmosphere
of
furniture
and
impersonal
emptiness
lay
the
hint
of
a
living
human
presence
and
with
such
conviction
did
it
come
upon
me
that
my
hand
instinctively
gripped
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
before
i
could
even
think
either
some
one
had
passed
along
this
corridor
just
before
me
or
some
one
lay
waiting
at
its
farther
end
withdrawn
or
flattened
into
one
of
the
little
recesses
to
let
me
pass
it
was
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
and
the
blood
ran
from
my
heart
as
i
realized
it
it
was
not
courage
that
sent
me
on
but
rather
a
strong
impulsion
from
behind
that
made
it
impossible
to
retreat
the
feeling
that
a
throng
pressed
at
my
back
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
that
i
was
already
half
surrounded
swept
dragged
coaxed
into
a
vast
where
there
was
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
their
fire
is
not
quenched
i
can
neither
explain
nor
justify
the
storm
of
irrational
emotion
that
swept
me
as
i
stood
in
that
moment
staring
down
the
length
of
the
silent
corridor
towards
the
at
the
far
end
i
can
only
repeat
that
no
personal
bravery
sent
me
down
it
but
that
the
negative
emotion
of
fear
was
swamped
in
this
vast
sea
of
pity
and
commiseration
for
others
that
surged
upon
me
my
senses
at
least
were
no
whit
confused
if
anything
my
brain
registered
impressions
with
keener
accuracy
than
usual
i
noticed
for
instance
that
the
two
swinging
doors
of
baize
that
cut
the
corridor
into
definite
lengths
making
little
rooms
of
the
spaces
between
them
were
both
in
the
dim
light
no
mean
achievement
also
that
the
fronds
of
a
palm
plant
some
ten
feet
in
front
of
me
still
stirred
gently
from
the
air
of
someone
who
had
recently
gone
past
them
the
long
green
leaves
waved
to
and
fro
like
hands
then
i
went
stealthily
forward
down
the
narrow
space
proud
even
that
i
had
this
command
of
myself
and
so
carefully
that
my
feet
made
no
sound
upon
the
japanese
matting
on
the
floor
it
was
a
journey
that
seemed
timeless
i
have
no
idea
how
fast
or
slow
i
went
but
i
remember
that
i
deliberately
examined
articles
on
each
side
of
me
peering
with
particular
closeness
into
the
recesses
of
wall
and
window
i
passed
the
first
baize
doors
and
the
passage
beyond
them
widened
out
to
hold
shelves
of
books
there
were
sofas
and
small
against
the
wall
it
narrowed
again
presently
as
i
entered
the
second
stretch
the
windows
here
were
higher
and
smaller
and
marble
statuettes
of
classical
subject
lined
the
walls
watching
me
like
figures
of
the
dead
their
white
and
shining
faces
saw
me
yet
made
no
sign
i
passed
next
between
the
second
baize
doors
they
too
had
been
fastened
back
with
hooks
against
the
wall
thus
all
doors
were
open
had
been
recently
opened
and
so
at
length
i
found
myself
in
the
final
widening
of
the
corridor
which
formed
an
antechamber
to
the
itself
it
had
been
used
formerly
to
hold
the
overflow
of
meetings
no
door
separated
it
from
the
great
hall
beyond
but
heavy
curtains
hung
usually
to
close
it
off
and
these
curtains
were
invariably
drawn
they
now
stood
wide
and
here
i
can
merely
state
the
impression
that
came
upon
me
i
knew
myself
at
last
surrounded
the
throng
that
pressed
behind
me
also
surged
in
front
facing
me
in
the
big
room
and
waiting
for
my
entry
stood
a
multitude
on
either
side
of
me
in
the
very
air
above
my
head
the
vast
assemblage
paused
upon
my
coming
the
pause
however
was
momentary
for
instantly
the
deep
tumultuous
movement
was
resumed
that
yet
was
silent
as
a
cavern
underground
i
felt
the
agony
that
was
in
it
the
passionate
striving
the
awful
struggle
to
escape
the
held
beseeching
faces
that
fought
to
press
themselves
upon
my
vision
yearning
yet
hopeless
eyes
lips
scorched
and
dry
mouths
that
opened
to
implore
but
found
no
craved
delivery
in
actual
words
and
a
fury
of
misery
and
hate
that
made
the
life
in
me
stop
dead
frozen
by
the
horror
of
vain
pity
that
intolerable
vain
hope
was
everywhere
and
the
multitude
it
came
to
me
was
not
a
single
multitude
but
many
for
as
soon
as
one
huge
division
pressed
too
close
upon
the
edge
of
escape
it
was
dragged
back
by
another
and
prevented
the
wild
host
was
divided
against
itself
here
dwelt
the
shadow
i
had
imagined
weeks
ago
and
in
it
struggled
armies
of
lost
souls
as
in
the
depths
of
some
bottomless
pit
whence
there
is
no
escape
the
layers
mingled
fighting
against
themselves
in
endless
torture
it
was
in
this
great
shadow
i
had
clairvoyantly
seen
mabel
but
about
its
fearful
mouth
i
now
was
certain
hovered
another
figure
of
darkness
a
figure
who
sought
to
keep
it
in
existence
since
to
her
thought
were
due
those
lampless
depths
of
woe
without
escape
towards
me
the
multitudes
now
surged
it
was
a
sound
and
a
movement
that
brought
me
back
into
myself
the
great
dock
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
just
then
struck
the
hour
of
three
that
was
the
sound
and
the
movement
i
was
aware
that
a
figure
was
passing
across
the
distant
center
of
the
floor
instantly
i
dropped
back
into
the
arena
of
my
little
human
terror
my
hand
again
clutched
stupidly
at
the
pistol
butt
i
drew
back
into
the
folds
of
the
heavy
curtain
and
the
figure
advanced
i
remember
every
detail
at
first
it
seemed
to
me
enormous
this
advancing
shadow
far
beyond
human
scale
but
as
it
came
nearer
i
measured
it
though
not
consciously
by
the
organ
pipes
that
gleamed
in
faint
colors
just
above
its
gradual
soft
approach
it
passed
them
already
halfway
across
the
great
room
i
saw
then
that
its
stature
was
that
of
ordinary
men
the
prolonged
booming
of
the
clock
died
away
i
heard
the
footfall
shuffling
upon
the
polished
boards
i
heard
another
sound
a
voice
low
and
monotonous
droning
as
in
prayer
the
figure
was
speaking
it
was
a
woman
and
she
carried
in
both
hands
before
her
a
small
object
that
faintly
shimmered
a
glass
of
water
and
then
i
recognized
her
there
was
still
an
instant
time
before
she
reached
me
and
i
made
use
of
it
i
shrank
back
flattening
myself
against
the
wall
her
voice
ceased
a
moment
as
she
turned
and
carefully
drew
the
curtains
together
behind
her
dosing
them
with
one
hand
oblivious
of
my
presence
though
she
actually
touched
my
dressing
gown
with
the
hand
that
pulled
the
cords
she
resumed
her
dreadful
solemn
march
disappearing
at
length
down
the
long
vista
of
the
corridor
like
a
shadow
but
as
she
passed
me
her
voice
began
again
so
that
i
heard
each
word
distinctly
as
she
uttered
it
her
head
aloft
her
figure
upright
as
though
she
moved
at
the
head
of
a
procession
a
drop
of
cold
water
given
in
his
name
shall
moisten
their
burning
tongues
it
was
repeated
monotonously
over
and
over
again
droning
down
into
the
distance
as
she
went
until
at
length
both
voice
and
figure
faded
into
the
shadows
at
the
farther
end
for
a
time
i
have
no
means
of
measuring
precisely
i
stood
in
that
dark
corner
pressing
my
back
against
the
wall
and
would
have
drawn
the
curtains
down
to
hide
me
had
i
dared
to
stretch
an
arm
out
the
dread
that
presently
the
woman
would
return
passed
gradually
away
i
realized
that
the
air
had
emptied
the
crowd
her
presence
had
stirred
into
activity
had
retreated
i
was
alone
in
the
gloomy
of
the
odious
building
then
i
remembered
suddenly
again
the
terrified
women
waiting
for
me
on
that
upper
landing
and
realized
that
my
skin
was
wet
and
freezing
cold
after
a
profuse
perspiration
i
prepared
to
retrace
my
steps
i
remember
the
effort
it
cost
me
to
leave
the
support
of
the
wall
and
covering
darkness
of
my
corner
and
step
out
into
the
grey
light
of
the
corridor
at
first
i
sidled
then
finding
this
mode
of
walking
impossible
turned
my
face
boldly
and
walked
quickly
regardless
that
my
dressing
gown
set
the
precious
objects
shaking
as
i
passed
a
wind
that
sighed
mournfully
against
the
high
small
windows
seemed
to
have
got
inside
the
corridor
as
well
it
felt
so
cold
and
every
moment
i
dreaded
to
see
the
outline
of
the
woman
figure
as
she
waited
in
recess
or
angle
against
the
wall
for
me
to
pass
was
there
another
thing
i
dreaded
even
more
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
the
first
baize
doors
had
swung
to
behind
me
and
the
second
ones
were
close
at
hand
when
the
great
dim
thunder
caught
me
pouring
up
with
prodigious
volume
so
that
it
seemed
to
roll
out
from
another
world
it
shook
the
very
bowels
of
the
building
i
was
closer
to
it
than
that
other
time
when
it
had
followed
me
from
the
goblin
garden
there
was
strength
and
hardness
in
it
as
of
metal
reverberation
some
touch
of
numbness
almost
of
paralysis
must
surely
have
been
upon
me
that
i
felt
no
actual
terror
for
i
remember
even
turning
and
standing
still
to
hear
it
better
that
is
the
noise
my
thought
ran
stupidly
and
i
think
i
whispered
it
aloud
the
doors
are
closing
the
wind
outside
against
the
windows
was
audible
so
it
can
not
have
been
really
loud
yet
to
me
it
was
the
biggest
deepest
sound
i
have
ever
heard
but
so
far
away
with
such
awful
remoteness
in
it
that
i
had
to
doubt
my
own
ears
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
underground
the
rumbling
of
earthquake
gates
that
shut
remorselessly
within
the
rocky
earth
stupendous
ultimate
thunder
they
were
shut
off
from
help
again
the
doors
had
closed
i
felt
a
storm
of
pity
an
agony
of
bitter
futile
hate
sweep
through
me
my
memory
of
the
figure
changed
then
the
woman
with
the
glass
of
cooling
water
had
stepped
down
from
heaven
but
the
man
or
was
it
men
who
smeared
this
terrible
layer
of
belief
and
thought
upon
the
world
i
crossed
the
dining
room
it
was
fancy
of
course
that
held
my
eyes
from
glancing
at
the
portrait
for
fear
i
should
see
it
smiling
approval
and
so
finally
reached
the
hall
where
the
light
from
the
floor
above
seemed
now
quite
bright
in
comparison
all
the
doors
i
closed
carefully
behind
me
but
first
i
had
to
open
them
the
woman
had
closed
every
one
up
the
stairs
then
i
actually
ran
two
steps
at
a
time
my
sister
was
standing
outside
mabel
door
by
her
face
i
knew
that
she
had
also
heard
there
was
no
need
to
ask
i
quickly
made
my
mind
up
there
nothing
i
said
and
detailed
briefly
my
tour
of
search
all
is
quiet
and
undisturbed
downstairs
may
god
forgive
me
she
beckoned
to
me
closing
the
door
softly
behind
her
my
heart
beat
violently
a
moment
then
stood
still
mabel
she
said
aloud
it
was
like
the
sentence
of
a
judge
that
one
short
word
i
tried
to
push
past
her
and
go
in
but
she
stopped
me
with
her
arm
she
was
wholly
mistress
of
herself
i
saw
hush
she
said
in
a
lower
voice
i
got
her
round
again
with
brandy
she
sleeping
quietly
now
we
wo
disturb
her
she
drew
me
farther
out
into
the
landing
and
as
she
did
so
the
clock
in
the
hall
below
struck
three
i
had
stood
then
thirty
minutes
in
the
corridor
below
you
been
such
a
long
time
she
said
simply
i
feared
for
you
and
she
took
my
hand
in
her
own
that
was
cold
and
clammy
chapter
viii
and
then
while
that
dreadful
house
stood
listening
about
us
in
the
early
hours
of
this
chill
morning
upon
the
edge
of
winter
she
told
me
with
laconic
brevity
things
about
mabel
that
i
heard
as
from
a
distance
there
was
nothing
so
unusual
or
tremendous
in
the
short
recital
nothing
indeed
i
might
not
have
already
guessed
for
myself
it
was
the
time
and
scene
the
inference
too
that
made
it
so
afflicting
the
idea
that
mabel
believed
herself
so
utterly
and
hopelessly
lost
beyond
recovery
damned
that
she
had
loved
him
with
so
passionate
a
devotion
that
she
had
given
her
soul
into
his
keeping
this
certainly
i
had
not
divined
probably
because
i
had
never
thought
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
he
had
converted
her
i
knew
but
that
she
had
subscribed
to
that
most
cruel
and
ugly
of
his
dogmas
this
was
new
to
me
and
came
with
a
certain
shock
as
i
heard
it
in
love
of
course
the
weaker
nature
is
receptive
to
all
manner
of
suggestion
this
man
had
suggested
his
pet
brimstone
lake
so
vividly
that
she
had
listened
and
believed
he
had
frightened
her
into
heaven
and
his
heaven
a
definite
locality
in
the
skies
had
its
foretaste
here
on
earth
in
miniature
the
towers
house
and
garden
into
his
dolorous
scheme
of
a
handful
saved
and
millions
damned
his
enclosure
as
it
were
of
sheep
and
goats
he
had
swept
her
before
she
was
aware
of
it
her
mind
no
longer
was
her
own
and
it
was
marsh
who
kept
the
open
though
tempered
as
she
deemed
with
that
touch
of
craven
superstitious
mercy
but
what
i
found
it
difficult
to
understand
and
still
more
difficult
to
accept
was
that
during
her
year
abroad
she
had
been
so
haunted
with
a
secret
dread
of
that
hideous
that
she
had
finally
revolted
and
tried
to
recover
that
clearer
state
of
mind
she
had
enjoyed
before
the
religious
bully
had
stunned
her
yet
had
tried
in
vain
she
had
returned
to
the
towers
to
find
her
soul
again
only
to
realize
that
it
was
lost
eternally
the
cleaner
state
of
mind
lay
then
beyond
recovery
in
the
reaction
that
followed
the
removal
of
his
terrible
suggestion
she
felt
the
crumbling
of
all
that
he
had
taught
her
but
searched
in
vain
for
the
peace
and
beauty
his
teachings
had
destroyed
nothing
came
to
replace
these
she
was
empty
desolate
hopeless
craving
her
former
joy
and
carelessness
she
found
only
hate
and
diabolical
calculation
this
man
whom
she
had
loved
to
the
point
of
losing
her
soul
for
him
had
bequeathed
to
her
one
black
and
fiery
thing
the
terror
of
the
damned
his
thinking
wrapped
her
in
this
iron
garment
that
held
her
fast
all
this
frances
told
me
far
more
briefly
than
i
have
here
repeated
it
in
her
eyes
and
gestures
and
laconic
sentences
lay
the
conviction
of
great
beating
issues
and
of
menacing
drama
my
own
description
fails
to
recapture
it
was
all
so
incongruous
and
remote
from
the
world
i
lived
in
that
more
than
once
a
smile
though
a
smile
of
pity
fluttered
to
my
lips
but
a
glimpse
of
my
face
in
the
mirror
showed
rather
the
leer
of
a
grimace
there
was
no
real
laughter
anywhere
that
night
the
entire
adventure
seemed
so
incredible
here
in
this
twentieth
century
but
yet
delusion
that
feeble
word
did
not
occur
once
in
the
comments
my
mind
suggested
though
did
not
utter
i
remembered
that
forbidding
shadow
too
my
sister
watercolors
the
vanished
personality
of
our
hostess
the
inexplicable
thundering
noise
and
the
figure
of
marsh
in
her
midnight
ritual
that
was
so
childish
yet
so
horrible
i
shivered
in
spite
of
my
own
emancipated
cast
of
mind
there
is
no
mabel
were
the
words
with
which
my
sister
sent
another
shower
of
ice
down
my
spine
he
has
killed
her
in
his
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
i
stared
at
her
blankly
as
in
a
nightmare
where
nothing
true
or
possible
ever
happened
he
killed
her
in
his
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
she
repeated
more
faintly
a
desperate
effort
was
in
me
to
say
the
strong
sensible
thing
which
should
destroy
the
oppressive
horror
that
grew
so
stiflingly
about
us
both
but
again
the
mirror
drew
the
attempted
smile
into
the
merest
grin
betraying
the
distortion
that
was
everywhere
in
the
place
you
mean
i
stammered
beneath
my
breath
that
her
faith
has
gone
but
that
the
terror
has
remained
i
asked
it
dully
groping
i
moved
out
of
the
line
of
the
reflection
in
the
glass
she
bowed
her
head
as
though
beneath
a
weight
her
skin
was
the
pallor
of
grey
ashes
you
mean
i
said
louder
that
she
has
lost
her
mind
she
is
terror
incarnate
was
the
whispered
answer
mabel
has
lost
her
soul
her
soul
is
there
she
pointed
horribly
below
she
is
seeking
it
the
word
soul
stung
me
into
something
of
my
normal
self
again
but
her
terror
poor
thing
is
not
can
not
be
transferable
to
us
i
exclaimed
more
vehemently
it
certainly
is
not
convertible
into
feelings
sights
and
even
sounds
she
interrupted
me
quickly
almost
impatiently
speaking
with
that
conviction
by
which
she
conquered
me
so
easily
that
night
it
is
her
terror
that
revived
others
it
has
brought
her
into
touch
with
them
they
are
loose
and
driving
after
her
her
efforts
at
resistance
have
given
them
also
hope
that
escape
after
all
is
possible
day
and
night
they
strive
escape
others
the
anger
fast
rising
in
me
dropped
of
its
own
accord
at
the
moment
of
birth
it
shrank
into
a
shuddering
beyond
my
control
in
that
moment
i
think
i
would
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
anything
and
everything
she
might
tell
me
to
argue
or
contradict
seemed
equally
futile
his
strong
belief
as
also
the
beliefs
of
others
who
have
preceded
him
she
replied
so
sure
of
herself
that
i
actually
turned
to
look
over
my
shoulder
have
left
their
shadow
like
a
thick
deposit
over
the
house
and
grounds
to
them
poor
souls
imprisoned
by
thought
it
was
hopeless
as
granite
walls
until
her
resistance
her
effort
to
dissipate
it
let
in
light
now
in
their
thousands
they
are
flocking
to
this
little
light
seeking
escape
her
own
escape
do
you
see
may
release
them
all
it
took
my
breath
away
had
his
predecessors
former
occupants
of
this
house
also
preached
damnation
of
all
the
world
but
their
own
exclusive
sect
was
this
the
explanation
of
her
obscure
talk
of
layers
each
striving
against
the
other
for
domination
and
if
men
are
spirits
and
these
spirits
survive
could
strong
thought
thus
determine
their
condition
even
afterwards
so
many
questions
flooded
into
me
that
i
selected
no
one
of
them
but
stared
in
uncomfortable
silence
bewildered
out
of
my
depth
and
acutely
painfully
distressed
there
was
so
odd
a
mixture
of
possible
truth
and
incredible
unacceptable
explanation
in
it
all
so
much
confirmed
yet
so
much
left
darker
than
before
what
she
said
did
indeed
offer
a
of
my
own
series
of
abominable
sensations
strife
agony
pity
hate
escape
but
so
that
only
the
deep
conviction
in
her
voice
and
attitude
made
it
tolerable
for
a
second
even
i
found
myself
in
a
curious
state
of
mind
i
could
neither
think
clearly
nor
say
a
word
to
refute
her
amazing
statements
whispered
there
beside
me
in
the
shivering
hours
of
the
early
morning
with
only
a
wall
between
ourselves
and
mabel
close
behind
her
words
i
remember
this
singular
thing
however
that
an
atmosphere
as
of
the
inquisition
seemed
to
rise
and
stir
about
the
room
beating
awful
wings
of
black
above
my
head
abruptly
then
a
moment
common
sense
returned
to
me
i
faced
her
and
the
noise
i
said
aloud
more
firmly
the
roar
of
the
closing
doors
we
have
all
heard
that
is
that
subjective
too
frances
looked
sideways
about
her
in
a
queer
fashion
that
made
my
flesh
creep
again
i
spoke
brusquely
almost
angrily
i
repeated
the
question
and
waited
with
anxiety
for
her
reply
what
noise
she
asked
with
the
frank
expression
of
an
innocent
child
what
closing
doors
but
her
face
turned
from
grey
to
white
and
i
saw
that
drops
of
perspiration
glistened
on
her
forehead
she
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
to
steady
herself
then
glanced
about
her
again
with
that
sidelong
look
that
made
my
blood
run
cold
i
understood
suddenly
then
she
did
not
take
in
what
i
said
i
knew
now
she
was
listening
for
something
else
and
the
discovery
revived
in
me
a
far
stronger
emotion
than
any
mere
desire
for
immediate
explanation
not
only
did
i
not
insist
upon
an
answer
but
i
was
actually
terrified
lest
she
would
answer
more
i
felt
in
me
a
terror
lest
i
should
be
moved
to
describe
my
own
experiences
thus
increasing
their
reality
and
so
the
reality
of
all
she
might
even
explain
them
too
still
listening
intently
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
her
lips
opened
to
speak
the
words
came
to
me
from
a
great
distance
it
seemed
and
her
voice
had
a
sound
like
a
stone
that
drops
into
a
deep
well
its
fate
though
hidden
known
we
are
in
it
with
her
too
bill
we
are
in
it
with
her
our
interpretations
vary
because
we
are
in
parts
of
it
only
mabel
is
in
it
all
the
desire
for
violence
came
over
me
if
only
she
would
say
a
definite
thing
in
plain
king
english
if
only
i
could
find
it
in
me
to
give
utterance
to
what
shouted
so
loud
within
me
if
only
the
same
old
cry
something
would
happen
for
all
this
elliptic
talk
that
dazed
my
mind
left
obscurity
everywhere
her
atrocious
meaning
nonetheless
flashed
through
me
though
vanishing
before
it
wholly
divulged
itself
it
brought
a
certain
reaction
with
it
i
found
my
tongue
whether
i
actually
believed
what
i
said
is
more
than
i
can
swear
to
that
it
seemed
to
me
wise
at
the
moment
is
all
i
remember
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
obscure
perception
less
than
that
of
normal
consciousness
yes
frances
i
believe
that
what
you
say
is
the
truth
and
that
we
are
in
it
with
her
i
meant
to
say
i
with
loud
hostile
emphasis
but
instead
i
whispered
it
lest
she
should
hear
the
trembling
of
my
voice
and
for
that
reason
my
dear
sister
we
leave
tomorrow
you
and
i
today
rather
since
it
is
long
past
midnight
we
leave
this
house
of
the
damned
we
go
back
to
london
frances
looked
up
her
face
distraught
almost
beyond
recognition
but
it
was
not
my
words
that
caused
the
tumult
in
her
heart
it
was
a
sound
the
sound
she
had
been
listening
for
so
faint
i
barely
caught
it
myself
and
had
she
not
pointed
i
could
never
have
known
the
direction
whence
it
came
small
and
terrible
it
rose
again
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
sound
of
gnashing
teeth
and
behind
it
came
another
the
tread
of
stealthy
footsteps
both
were
just
outside
the
door
the
room
swung
round
me
for
a
second
my
first
instinct
to
prevent
my
sister
going
out
she
had
dashed
past
me
frantically
to
the
door
gave
place
to
another
when
i
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
i
followed
her
lead
instead
it
was
surer
than
my
own
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
swung
uselessly
against
my
thigh
i
was
flustered
beyond
belief
and
ashamed
that
i
was
so
keep
close
to
me
frances
i
said
huskily
as
the
door
swung
wide
and
a
shaft
of
light
fell
upon
a
figure
moving
rapidly
mabel
was
going
down
the
corridor
beyond
her
in
the
shadows
on
the
staircase
a
second
figure
stood
beckoning
scarcely
visible
before
they
get
her
quick
was
screamed
into
my
ears
and
our
arms
were
about
her
in
the
same
moment
it
was
a
horrible
scene
not
that
mabel
struggled
in
the
least
but
that
she
collapsed
as
we
caught
her
and
fell
with
her
dead
weight
as
of
a
corpse
limp
against
us
and
her
teeth
began
again
they
continued
even
beneath
the
hand
that
frances
clapped
upon
her
lips
we
carried
her
back
into
her
own
bedroom
where
she
lay
down
peacefully
enough
it
was
so
soon
over
the
rapidity
of
the
whole
thing
robbed
it
of
reality
almost
it
had
the
swiftness
of
something
remembered
rather
than
of
something
witnessed
she
slept
again
so
quickly
that
it
was
almost
as
if
we
had
caught
her
sleepwalking
i
can
not
say
i
asked
no
questions
at
the
time
i
have
asked
none
since
and
my
help
was
needed
as
little
as
the
protection
of
my
pistol
frances
was
strangely
competent
and
collected
i
lingered
for
some
time
uselessly
by
the
door
till
at
length
looking
up
with
a
sigh
she
made
a
sign
for
me
to
go
i
shall
wait
in
your
room
next
door
i
whispered
till
you
come
but
though
going
out
i
waited
in
the
corridor
instead
so
as
to
hear
the
faintest
call
for
help
in
that
dark
corridor
upstairs
i
waited
but
not
long
it
may
have
been
fifteen
minutes
when
frances
reappeared
locking
the
door
softly
behind
her
leaning
over
the
banisters
i
saw
her
i
go
in
again
about
six
she
whispered
as
soon
as
it
gets
light
she
is
sound
asleep
now
please
do
wait
if
anything
happens
i
call
you
might
leave
your
door
ajar
perhaps
and
she
came
up
looking
like
a
ghost
but
i
saw
her
first
safely
into
bed
and
the
rest
of
the
night
i
spent
in
an
armchair
close
to
my
opened
door
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
soon
after
five
i
heard
frances
fumbling
with
the
key
and
peering
over
the
railing
again
i
waited
till
she
reappeared
and
went
back
into
her
own
room
she
closed
her
door
evidently
she
was
satisfied
that
all
was
well
then
and
then
only
did
i
go
to
bed
myself
but
not
to
sleep
i
could
not
get
the
scene
out
of
my
mind
especially
that
odious
detail
of
it
which
i
hoped
and
believed
my
sister
had
not
seen
the
still
dark
figure
of
the
housekeeper
waiting
on
the
stairs
below
waiting
of
course
for
mabel
chapter
ix
it
seems
i
became
a
mere
spectator
after
that
my
sister
lead
was
so
assured
for
one
thing
and
for
another
the
responsibility
of
leaving
mabel
alone
frances
laid
it
bodily
upon
my
shoulders
was
a
little
more
than
i
cared
about
moreover
when
we
all
three
met
later
in
the
day
things
went
on
so
exactly
as
before
so
absolutely
without
friction
or
distress
that
to
present
a
sudden
obvious
excuse
for
cutting
our
visit
short
seemed
and
on
the
lowest
grounds
it
would
have
been
desertion
at
any
rate
it
was
beyond
my
powers
and
frances
was
quite
firm
that
she
must
stay
we
therefore
did
stay
things
that
happen
in
the
night
always
seem
exaggerated
and
distorted
when
the
sun
shines
brightly
next
morning
no
one
can
reconstruct
the
terror
of
a
nightmare
afterwards
nor
comprehend
why
it
seemed
so
overwhelming
at
the
time
i
slept
till
ten
and
when
i
rang
for
breakfast
a
note
from
my
sister
lay
upon
the
tray
its
message
of
counsel
couched
in
a
calm
and
comforting
strain
mabel
she
assured
me
was
herself
again
and
remembered
nothing
of
what
had
happened
there
was
no
need
of
any
violent
measures
i
was
to
treat
her
exactly
as
if
i
knew
nothing
and
if
you
do
mind
bill
let
us
leave
the
matter
unmentioned
between
ourselves
as
well
discussion
exaggerates
such
things
are
best
not
talked
about
i
sorry
i
disturbed
you
so
unnecessarily
i
was
stupidly
excited
please
forget
all
the
things
i
said
at
the
moment
she
had
written
nonsense
first
instead
of
things
then
scratched
it
out
she
wished
to
convey
that
hysteria
had
been
abroad
in
the
night
and
i
readily
gulped
the
explanation
down
though
it
could
not
satisfy
me
in
the
smallest
degree
there
was
another
week
of
our
visit
still
and
we
stayed
it
out
to
the
end
without
disaster
my
desire
to
leave
at
times
became
that
frantic
thing
desire
to
escape
but
i
controlled
it
kept
silent
watched
and
wondered
nothing
happened
as
before
and
everywhere
there
was
no
sequence
of
development
no
connection
between
cause
and
effect
and
climax
none
whatever
the
thing
swayed
up
and
down
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
great
loose
curtain
in
the
wind
and
i
could
only
vaguely
surmise
what
caused
the
draught
or
why
there
was
a
curtain
at
all
a
novelist
might
mold
the
queer
material
into
coherent
sequence
that
would
be
interesting
but
could
not
be
true
it
remains
therefore
not
a
story
but
a
history
nothing
happened
perhaps
my
intense
dislike
of
the
fall
of
darkness
was
due
wholly
to
my
stirred
imagination
and
perhaps
my
anger
when
i
learned
that
frances
now
occupied
a
bed
in
our
hostess
room
was
unreasonable
nerves
were
unquestionably
on
edge
i
was
forever
on
the
lookout
for
some
event
that
should
make
escape
imperative
but
yet
that
never
presented
itself
i
slept
lightly
left
my
door
ajar
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
even
made
stealthy
tours
of
the
house
while
everybody
dreamed
in
their
beds
but
i
discovered
nothing
the
doors
were
always
locked
i
neither
saw
the
housekeeper
again
in
unreasonable
times
and
places
nor
heard
a
footstep
in
the
passages
and
halls
the
noise
was
never
once
repeated
that
horrible
ultimate
thunder
my
intensest
dread
of
all
lay
withdrawn
into
the
abyss
whence
it
had
twice
arisen
and
though
in
my
thoughts
it
was
sternly
denied
existence
the
great
black
reason
for
the
fact
afflicted
me
unbelievably
since
mabel
fruitless
effort
to
escape
the
doors
kept
closed
remorselessly
she
had
failed
they
gave
up
hope
for
this
was
the
explanation
that
haunted
the
region
of
my
mind
where
feelings
stir
and
hint
before
they
clothe
themselves
in
actual
language
only
i
firmly
kept
it
there
it
never
knew
expression
but
if
my
ears
were
open
my
eyes
were
opened
too
and
it
were
idle
to
pretend
that
i
did
not
notice
a
hundred
details
that
were
capable
of
sinister
interpretation
had
i
been
weak
enough
to
yield
some
protective
barrier
had
fallen
into
ruins
round
me
so
that
terror
stalked
behind
the
general
collapse
feeling
for
me
through
all
the
gaping
fissures
much
of
this
i
admit
must
have
been
merely
the
elaboration
of
those
sensations
i
had
first
vaguely
felt
before
subsequent
events
and
my
talks
with
frances
had
dramatized
them
into
living
thoughts
i
therefore
leave
them
unmentioned
in
this
history
just
as
my
mind
left
them
unmentioned
in
that
interminable
final
week
our
life
went
on
precisely
as
before
mabel
unreal
and
outwardly
so
still
frances
secretive
anxious
tactful
to
the
point
of
slyness
and
keen
to
save
to
the
point
of
there
were
the
same
stupid
meals
the
same
wearisome
long
evenings
the
stifling
ugliness
of
house
and
grounds
the
shadow
settling
in
so
thickly
that
it
seemed
almost
a
visible
tangible
thing
i
came
to
feel
the
only
friendly
things
in
all
this
hostile
cruel
place
were
the
robins
that
hopped
boldly
over
the
monstrous
terraces
and
even
up
to
the
windows
of
the
unsightly
house
itself
the
robins
alone
knew
joy
they
danced
believing
no
evil
thing
was
possible
in
all
god
radiant
world
they
believed
in
everybody
their
god
plan
of
life
had
no
room
in
it
for
hell
damnation
and
lakes
of
brimstone
i
came
to
love
the
little
birds
had
samuel
franklyn
known
them
he
might
have
preached
a
different
sermon
bequeathing
love
in
place
of
terror
most
of
my
time
i
spent
writing
but
it
was
a
pretence
at
best
and
rather
a
dangerous
one
besides
for
it
stirred
the
mind
to
production
with
the
result
that
other
things
came
pouring
in
as
well
with
reading
it
was
the
same
in
the
end
i
found
an
aggressive
deliberate
resistance
to
be
the
only
way
of
feasible
defense
to
walk
far
afield
was
out
of
the
question
for
it
meant
leaving
my
sister
too
long
alone
so
that
my
exercise
was
confined
to
nearer
home
my
saunters
in
the
grounds
however
never
surprised
the
goblin
garden
again
it
was
close
at
hand
but
i
seemed
unable
to
get
wholly
into
it
too
many
things
assailed
my
mind
for
any
one
to
hold
exclusive
possession
perhaps
indeed
all
the
interpretations
all
the
layers
to
use
my
phrase
slipped
in
by
turns
and
lodged
there
for
a
time
they
came
day
and
night
and
though
my
reason
denied
them
entrance
they
held
their
own
as
by
a
kind
of
squatter
right
they
stirred
moods
already
in
me
that
is
and
did
not
introduce
entirely
new
ones
for
every
mind
conceals
ancestral
deposits
that
have
been
cultivated
in
turn
along
the
whole
line
of
its
descent
any
day
a
chance
shower
may
cause
this
one
or
that
to
blossom
thus
it
came
to
me
at
any
rate
after
darkness
the
inquisition
paced
the
empty
corridors
and
set
up
ghastly
apparatus
in
the
dismal
halls
and
once
in
the
library
there
swept
over
me
that
easy
and
delicious
conviction
that
by
confessing
my
wickedness
i
could
resume
it
later
since
confession
is
expression
and
expression
brings
relief
and
leaves
one
ready
to
accumulate
again
and
in
such
mood
i
felt
bitter
and
unforgiving
towards
all
others
who
thought
differently
another
time
it
was
a
pagan
thing
that
assaulted
me
so
trivial
yet
oh
so
significant
at
the
time
when
i
dreamed
that
a
herd
of
centaurs
rolled
up
with
a
great
stamping
of
hoofs
round
the
house
to
destroy
it
and
then
woke
to
hear
the
horses
tramping
across
the
field
below
the
lawns
they
neighed
ominously
and
their
noisy
panting
was
audible
as
if
it
were
just
outside
my
windows
but
the
tree
episode
i
think
was
the
most
curious
of
all
except
perhaps
the
incident
with
the
children
which
i
shall
mention
in
a
moment
for
its
closeness
to
reality
was
so
unforgettable
outside
the
east
window
of
my
room
stood
a
giant
wellingtonia
on
the
lawn
its
head
rising
level
with
the
upper
sash
it
grew
some
twenty
feet
away
planted
on
the
highest
terrace
and
i
often
saw
it
when
closing
my
curtains
for
the
night
noticing
how
it
drew
its
heavy
skirts
about
it
and
how
the
light
from
other
windows
threw
glimmering
streaks
and
patches
that
turned
it
into
the
semblance
of
a
towering
solemn
image
it
stood
there
then
so
strikingly
somehow
like
a
great
idol
that
it
claimed
attention
its
appearance
was
curiously
formidable
its
branches
rustled
without
visibly
moving
and
it
had
a
certain
portentous
forbidding
air
so
grand
and
dark
and
monstrous
in
the
night
that
i
was
always
glad
when
my
curtains
shut
it
out
yet
once
in
bed
i
had
never
thought
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
by
day
had
certainly
never
sought
it
out
one
night
then
as
i
went
to
bed
and
closed
this
window
against
a
cutting
easterly
wind
i
saw
that
there
were
two
of
these
trees
a
brother
wellingtonia
rose
mysteriously
beside
it
equally
huge
equally
towering
equally
monstrous
the
menacing
pair
of
them
faced
me
there
upon
the
lawn
but
in
this
new
arrival
lay
a
strange
suggestion
that
frightened
me
before
i
could
argue
it
away
exact
counterpart
of
its
giant
companion
it
revealed
also
that
gross
odious
quality
that
all
my
sister
paintings
held
i
got
the
odd
impression
that
the
rest
of
these
trees
stretching
away
dimly
in
a
troop
over
the
farther
lawns
were
similar
and
that
led
by
this
enormous
pair
they
had
all
moved
boldly
closer
to
my
windows
at
the
same
moment
a
blind
was
drawn
down
over
an
upper
room
the
second
tree
disappeared
into
the
surrounding
darkness
it
was
of
course
this
chance
light
that
had
brought
it
into
the
field
of
vision
but
when
the
black
shutter
dropped
over
it
hiding
it
from
view
the
manner
of
its
vanishing
produced
the
queer
effect
that
it
had
slipped
into
its
companion
almost
that
it
had
been
an
emanation
of
the
one
i
so
disliked
and
not
really
a
tree
at
all
in
this
way
the
garden
turned
vehicle
for
expressing
what
lay
behind
it
all
the
behavior
of
the
doors
the
little
ordinary
doors
seems
scarcely
worth
mention
at
all
their
queer
way
of
opening
and
shutting
of
their
own
accord
for
this
was
accountable
in
a
hundred
natural
ways
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
caught
one
in
the
act
of
moving
indeed
only
after
frequent
repetitions
did
the
detail
force
itself
upon
me
when
having
noticed
one
i
noticed
all
it
produced
however
the
unpleasant
impression
of
a
continual
coming
and
going
in
the
house
as
though
screened
cleverly
and
purposely
from
actual
sight
some
one
in
the
building
held
constant
invisible
intercourse
with
others
upon
detailed
descriptions
of
these
uncertain
incidents
i
do
not
venture
individually
so
trivial
but
taken
all
together
so
impressive
and
so
insolent
but
the
episode
of
the
children
mentioned
above
was
different
and
i
give
it
because
it
showed
how
vividly
the
intuitive
received
the
impression
one
impression
at
any
rate
of
what
was
in
the
air
it
may
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
i
believe
they
were
the
coachman
children
and
that
the
man
had
been
in
service
but
of
neither
point
am
i
quite
positive
i
heard
screaming
in
the
that
runs
along
the
stable
walls
it
was
one
afternoon
not
far
from
the
and
on
hurrying
up
i
found
a
little
girl
of
nine
or
ten
fastened
with
ropes
to
a
rustic
seat
and
two
other
children
boys
one
about
twelve
and
one
much
younger
gathering
sticks
beneath
the
climbing
rose
trees
the
girl
was
white
and
frightened
but
the
others
were
laughing
and
talking
among
themselves
so
busily
while
they
picked
that
they
did
not
notice
my
abrupt
arrival
some
game
i
understood
was
in
progress
but
a
game
that
had
become
too
serious
for
the
happiness
of
the
prisoner
for
there
was
a
fear
in
the
girl
eyes
that
was
a
very
genuine
fear
indeed
i
unfastened
her
at
once
the
ropes
were
so
loosely
and
clumsily
knotted
that
they
had
not
hurt
her
skin
it
was
not
that
which
made
her
pale
she
collapsed
a
moment
upon
the
bench
then
picked
up
her
tiny
skirts
and
dived
away
at
full
speed
into
the
safety
of
the
there
was
no
response
to
my
brief
comforting
but
she
ran
as
though
for
her
life
and
i
divined
that
some
horrid
boys
cruelty
had
been
afoot
it
was
probably
mere
thoughtlessness
as
cruelty
with
children
usually
is
but
something
in
me
decided
to
discover
exactly
what
it
was
and
the
boys
not
one
whit
alarmed
at
my
intervention
merely
laughed
shyly
when
i
explained
that
their
prisoner
had
escaped
and
told
me
frankly
what
their
gime
had
been
there
was
no
vestige
of
shame
in
them
nor
any
idea
of
course
that
they
aped
a
monstrous
reality
that
it
was
mere
pretence
was
neither
here
nor
there
to
them
though
it
was
a
of
something
that
was
right
and
natural
and
in
no
sense
cruel
did
it
too
it
was
necessary
for
her
good
we
was
going
to
burn
her
up
sir
the
older
one
informed
me
answering
my
why
with
the
explanation
because
she
would
believe
what
we
wanted
to
believe
and
game
though
it
was
the
feeling
of
reality
about
the
little
episode
was
so
arresting
so
terrific
in
some
way
that
only
with
difficulty
did
i
confine
my
admonitions
on
this
occasion
to
mere
words
the
boys
slunk
off
frightened
in
their
turn
yet
not
i
felt
convinced
that
they
had
erred
in
principle
it
was
their
inheritance
they
had
breathed
it
in
with
the
atmosphere
of
their
they
would
renew
the
salutary
torture
when
they
could
till
she
believed
as
they
did
i
went
back
into
the
house
afflicted
with
a
passion
of
mingled
pity
and
distress
impossible
to
describe
yet
on
my
short
way
across
the
garden
was
attacked
by
other
moods
in
turn
each
more
real
and
bitter
than
its
predecessor
i
received
the
whole
series
as
it
were
at
once
i
felt
like
a
diver
rising
to
the
surface
through
layers
of
water
at
different
temperatures
though
here
the
natural
order
was
reversed
and
the
cooler
strata
were
uppermost
the
heated
ones
below
thus
i
was
caught
by
the
goblin
touch
of
the
willows
that
fringed
the
field
by
the
sensuous
curving
of
the
twisted
ash
that
formed
a
gateway
to
the
little
grove
of
sapling
oaks
where
fauns
and
satyrs
lurked
to
play
in
the
moonlight
before
pagan
altars
and
by
the
cloaking
darkness
next
of
the
copse
of
stunted
pines
close
gathered
each
to
each
where
hooded
figures
stalked
behind
an
awful
cross
the
episode
with
the
children
seemed
to
have
opened
me
like
a
knife
the
whole
place
rushed
at
me
i
suspect
this
synthesis
of
many
moods
produced
in
me
that
climax
of
loathing
and
disgust
which
made
me
feel
the
limit
of
bearable
emotion
had
been
reached
so
that
i
made
straight
to
find
frances
in
order
to
convince
her
that
at
any
rate
i
must
leave
for
although
this
was
our
last
day
in
the
house
and
we
had
arranged
to
go
next
day
the
dread
was
in
me
that
she
would
still
find
some
persuasive
reason
for
staying
on
and
an
unexpected
incident
then
made
my
dread
unnecessary
the
front
door
was
open
and
a
cab
stood
in
the
drive
a
tall
elderly
man
was
gravely
talking
in
the
hall
with
the
parlor
maid
we
called
the
grenadier
he
held
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
have
called
to
see
the
house
i
heard
him
say
as
i
ran
up
the
stairs
to
frances
who
was
peering
like
an
inquisitive
child
over
the
banisters
yes
she
told
me
with
a
sigh
i
know
not
whether
of
resignation
or
relief
the
house
is
to
be
let
or
sold
mabel
has
decided
some
society
or
other
i
believe
i
was
overjoyed
this
made
our
leaving
right
and
possible
you
never
told
me
frances
mabel
only
heard
of
it
a
few
days
ago
she
told
me
herself
this
morning
it
is
a
chance
she
says
alone
she
can
not
get
it
defeat
i
asked
watching
her
closely
she
thinks
she
has
found
a
way
out
it
not
a
family
you
see
it
a
society
a
sort
of
community
they
go
in
for
thought
a
community
i
gasped
you
mean
religious
she
shook
her
head
not
exactly
she
said
smiling
but
some
kind
of
association
of
men
and
women
who
want
a
headquarters
in
the
country
a
place
where
they
can
write
and
meditate
think
mature
their
plans
and
all
the
rest
i
do
know
exactly
what
utopian
dreamers
i
asked
yet
feeling
an
immense
relief
come
over
me
as
i
heard
but
i
asked
in
ignorance
not
cynically
frances
would
know
she
knew
all
this
kind
of
thing
no
not
that
exactly
she
smiled
their
teachings
are
grand
and
simple
old
as
the
world
too
really
the
basis
of
every
religion
before
men
minds
perverted
them
with
their
manufactured
creeds
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
the
sound
of
voices
interrupted
our
odd
impromptu
conversation
as
the
grenadier
came
up
followed
by
the
tall
grave
gentleman
who
was
being
shown
over
the
house
my
sister
drew
me
along
the
corridor
towards
her
room
where
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
yet
not
before
i
had
stolen
a
good
look
at
the
caller
long
enough
at
least
for
his
face
and
general
appearance
to
have
made
a
definite
impression
on
me
for
something
strong
and
peaceful
emanated
from
his
presence
he
moved
with
such
quiet
dignity
the
glance
of
his
eyes
was
so
steady
and
reassuring
that
my
mind
labeled
him
instantly
as
a
type
of
man
one
would
turn
to
in
an
emergency
and
not
be
disappointed
i
had
seen
him
but
for
a
passing
moment
but
i
had
seen
him
twice
and
the
way
he
walked
down
the
passage
looking
competently
about
him
conveyed
the
same
impression
as
when
i
saw
him
standing
at
the
door
fearless
tolerant
wise
a
sincere
and
kindly
character
i
judged
instantly
a
man
whom
some
big
kind
of
love
has
trained
in
sweetness
towards
the
world
no
hate
in
him
anywhere
a
great
deal
no
doubt
to
read
in
so
brief
a
glance
yet
his
voice
confirmed
my
intuition
a
deep
and
very
gentle
voice
great
firmness
in
it
too
have
i
become
suddenly
sensitive
to
people
atmospheres
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
i
asked
myself
smiling
as
i
stood
in
the
room
and
heard
the
door
close
behind
me
have
i
developed
some
clairvoyant
faculty
here
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
mocked
and
i
sat
down
and
faced
my
sister
feeling
strangely
comforted
and
at
peace
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
stepped
beneath
the
towers
roof
a
month
ago
frances
i
then
saw
was
smiling
a
little
as
she
watched
me
you
know
him
i
asked
you
felt
it
too
was
her
question
in
reply
no
she
added
i
know
him
beyond
the
fact
that
he
is
a
leader
in
the
movement
and
has
devoted
years
and
money
to
its
objects
mabel
felt
the
same
thing
in
him
that
you
have
felt
and
jumped
at
it
but
you
seen
him
before
i
urged
for
the
certainty
was
in
me
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
her
she
shook
her
head
he
called
one
day
early
this
week
when
you
were
out
mabel
saw
him
i
believe
she
hesitated
a
moment
as
though
expecting
me
to
stop
her
with
my
usual
impatience
of
such
subjects
i
believe
he
has
explained
everything
to
her
the
beliefs
he
embodies
she
declares
are
her
salvation
might
be
rather
if
she
could
adopt
them
conversion
again
for
i
remembered
her
riches
and
how
gladly
a
society
would
gobble
them
the
layers
i
told
you
about
she
continued
calmly
shrugging
her
shoulders
slightly
the
deposits
that
are
left
behind
by
strong
thinking
and
real
belief
but
especially
by
ugly
hateful
belief
because
you
see
unfortunately
there
more
vital
passion
in
that
sort
frances
i
do
understand
a
bit
i
said
out
loud
but
said
it
a
little
humbly
for
the
impression
the
man
had
left
was
still
strong
upon
me
and
i
was
grateful
for
the
steady
sense
of
peace
and
comfort
he
had
somehow
introduced
the
horrors
had
been
so
dreadful
my
nerves
doubtless
were
more
than
a
little
overstrained
absurd
as
it
must
sound
i
classed
him
in
my
mind
with
the
robins
the
happy
confiding
robins
who
believed
in
everybody
and
thought
no
evil
i
laughed
a
moment
at
my
ridiculous
idea
and
my
sister
encouraged
by
this
sign
of
patience
in
me
continued
more
fluently
of
course
you
do
understand
bill
why
should
you
you
never
thought
about
such
things
needing
no
creed
yourself
you
think
all
creeds
are
rubbish
i
open
to
conviction
i
tolerant
i
interrupted
you
as
narrow
as
sam
franklyn
and
as
crammed
with
prejudice
she
answered
knowing
that
she
had
me
at
her
mercy
then
pray
what
may
be
his
or
his
society
beliefs
i
asked
feeling
no
desire
to
argue
and
how
are
they
going
to
prove
your
mabel
salvation
can
they
bring
beauty
into
all
this
aggressive
hate
and
ugliness
certain
hope
and
peace
she
said
that
peace
which
is
understanding
and
that
understanding
which
explains
all
creeds
and
therefore
tolerates
them
toleration
the
one
word
a
religious
man
loathes
above
all
others
his
pet
word
is
damnation
tolerates
them
she
repeated
patiently
unperturbed
by
my
explosion
because
it
includes
them
all
fine
if
true
i
admitted
very
fine
but
how
pray
does
it
include
them
all
because
the
the
motto
of
their
society
is
is
no
religion
higher
than
truth
and
it
has
no
single
dogma
of
any
kind
above
all
she
went
on
because
it
claims
that
no
individual
can
be
it
teaches
universal
salvation
to
damn
outsiders
is
uncivilized
childish
impure
some
take
longer
than
others
according
to
the
way
they
think
and
live
but
all
find
peace
through
development
in
the
end
what
the
creeds
call
a
hopeless
soul
it
regards
as
a
soul
having
further
to
go
there
is
no
damnation
well
well
i
exclaimed
feeling
that
she
rode
her
hobby
horse
too
wildly
too
roughly
over
me
but
what
is
the
bearing
of
all
this
upon
this
dreadful
place
and
upon
mabel
i
admit
that
there
is
this
atmosphere
this
er
inexplicable
horror
in
the
house
and
grounds
and
that
if
not
of
damnation
exactly
it
is
certainly
damnable
i
not
too
prejudiced
to
deny
that
for
i
felt
it
myself
to
my
relief
she
was
brief
she
made
her
statement
leaving
me
to
take
it
or
reject
it
as
i
would
the
thought
and
belief
its
former
occupants
have
left
behind
for
there
has
been
coincidence
here
a
coincidence
that
must
be
rare
the
site
on
which
this
modern
house
now
stands
was
roman
before
that
early
britain
with
burial
mounds
before
that
again
druid
the
druid
stones
still
lie
in
that
copse
below
the
field
the
tumuli
among
the
ilexes
behind
the
drive
the
older
building
sam
franklyn
altered
and
practically
pulled
down
was
a
monastery
he
changed
the
chapel
into
a
meeting
hall
which
is
now
the
music
room
but
before
he
came
here
the
house
was
occupied
by
manetti
a
violent
catholic
without
tolerance
or
vision
and
in
the
interval
between
these
two
julius
weinbaum
had
it
hebrew
of
most
rigid
orthodox
type
imaginable
so
they
all
have
left
their
even
so
i
repeated
yet
interested
to
hear
the
rest
what
of
it
simply
this
said
frances
with
conviction
that
each
in
turn
has
left
his
layer
of
concentrated
thinking
and
belief
behind
him
because
each
believed
intensely
absolutely
beyond
the
least
weakening
of
any
doubt
the
kind
of
strong
belief
and
thinking
that
is
rare
anywhere
today
the
kind
that
wills
impregnates
objects
saturates
the
atmosphere
haunts
in
a
word
and
each
believing
he
was
utterly
and
finally
right
damned
with
equally
positive
conviction
the
rest
of
the
world
one
and
all
preached
that
implicitly
if
not
explicitly
it
the
root
of
every
creed
last
of
the
bigoted
grim
series
came
samuel
franklyn
i
listened
in
amazement
that
increased
as
she
went
on
up
to
this
point
her
explanation
was
so
admirable
it
was
indeed
a
pretty
study
in
psychology
if
it
were
true
then
why
does
nothing
ever
happen
i
enquired
mildly
a
place
so
thickly
haunted
ought
to
produce
a
crop
of
no
ordinary
results
there
lies
the
proof
she
went
on
in
a
lowered
voice
the
proof
of
the
horror
and
the
ugly
reality
the
thought
and
belief
of
each
occupant
in
turn
kept
all
the
others
under
they
gave
no
sign
of
life
at
the
time
but
the
results
of
thinking
never
die
they
crop
out
again
the
moment
there
an
opening
and
with
the
return
of
mabel
in
her
negative
state
believing
nothing
positive
herself
the
place
for
the
first
time
found
itself
free
to
reproduce
its
buried
stores
damnation
and
the
rest
the
most
permanent
and
vital
thought
of
all
those
creeds
since
it
was
applied
to
the
majority
of
the
world
broke
loose
again
for
there
was
no
restraint
to
hold
it
back
each
sought
to
obtain
its
former
supremacy
none
conquered
there
results
a
pandemonium
of
hate
and
fear
of
striving
to
escape
of
agonized
bitter
warring
to
find
safety
peace
salvation
the
place
is
saturated
by
that
appalling
stream
of
thinking
the
terror
of
the
damned
it
concentrated
upon
mabel
whose
negative
attitude
furnished
the
channel
of
deliverance
you
and
i
according
to
our
sympathy
with
her
were
similarly
involved
nothing
happened
because
no
one
layer
could
ever
gain
the
supremacy
i
was
so
interested
i
dare
not
say
amused
that
i
stared
in
silence
while
she
paused
a
moment
afraid
that
she
would
draw
rein
and
end
the
fairy
tale
too
soon
the
beliefs
of
this
man
of
his
society
rather
vigorously
thought
and
therefore
vigorously
given
out
here
will
put
the
whole
place
straight
it
will
act
as
a
solvent
these
vitriolic
layers
actively
denied
will
fuse
and
disappear
in
the
stream
of
gentle
tolerant
sympathy
which
is
love
for
each
member
worthy
of
the
name
loves
the
world
and
all
creeds
go
into
the
mabel
too
if
she
joins
them
out
of
real
conviction
will
find
salvation
thinking
i
know
is
of
the
first
importance
i
objected
but
you
perhaps
exaggerate
the
power
of
feeling
and
emotion
which
in
religion
are
au
fond
always
hysterical
what
is
the
world
she
told
me
but
thinking
and
feeling
an
individual
world
is
entirely
what
that
individual
thinks
and
believes
interpretation
there
is
no
other
and
unless
he
really
thinks
and
really
believes
he
has
no
permanent
world
at
all
i
grant
that
few
people
think
and
still
fewer
believe
and
that
most
take
suits
and
make
them
do
only
the
strong
make
their
own
things
the
lesser
fry
mabel
among
them
are
merely
swept
up
into
what
has
been
manufactured
for
them
they
get
along
somehow
you
and
i
have
made
for
ourselves
mabel
has
not
she
is
a
nonentity
and
when
her
belief
is
taken
from
her
she
goes
with
it
it
was
not
in
me
just
then
to
criticize
the
evasion
or
pick
out
the
sophistry
from
the
truth
i
merely
waited
for
her
to
continue
none
of
us
have
truth
my
dear
frances
i
ventured
presently
seeing
that
she
kept
silent
precisely
she
answered
but
most
of
us
have
beliefs
and
what
one
believes
and
thinks
affects
the
world
at
large
consider
the
legacy
of
hatred
and
cruelty
involved
in
the
doctrines
men
have
built
into
their
creeds
where
the
sine
qua
non
of
salvation
is
absolute
acceptance
of
one
particular
set
of
views
or
else
perishing
everlastingly
for
only
by
repudiating
history
can
they
disavow
it
you
not
quite
accurate
i
put
in
not
all
the
creeds
teach
damnation
do
they
franklyn
did
of
course
but
the
others
are
a
bit
modernized
now
surely
trying
to
get
out
of
it
she
admitted
perhaps
they
are
but
damnation
of
unbelievers
of
most
of
the
world
that
is
is
their
rather
favorite
idea
if
you
talk
with
them
i
never
have
she
smiled
but
i
have
she
said
significantly
so
if
you
consider
what
the
various
occupants
of
this
house
have
so
strongly
held
and
thought
and
believed
you
need
not
be
surprised
that
the
influence
they
have
left
behind
them
should
be
a
dark
and
dreadful
legacy
for
thought
you
know
does
leave
the
opening
of
the
door
to
my
great
relief
interrupted
her
as
the
grenadier
led
in
the
visitor
to
see
the
room
he
bowed
to
both
of
us
with
a
brief
word
of
apology
looked
round
him
and
withdrew
and
with
his
departure
the
conversation
between
us
came
naturally
to
an
end
i
followed
him
out
neither
of
us
in
any
case
i
think
cared
to
argue
further
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
the
curious
history
of
the
towers
ends
here
too
there
was
no
climax
in
the
story
sense
nothing
ever
really
happened
we
left
next
morning
for
london
i
only
know
that
the
society
in
question
took
the
house
and
have
since
occupied
it
to
their
entire
satisfaction
and
that
mabel
who
became
a
member
shortly
afterwards
now
stays
there
frequently
when
in
need
of
repose
from
the
arduous
and
unselfish
labors
she
took
upon
herself
under
its
aegis
she
dined
with
us
only
the
other
night
here
in
our
tiny
chelsea
flat
and
a
jollier
saner
more
interesting
and
happy
guest
i
could
hardly
wish
for
she
was
vital
in
the
best
sense
the
lay
figure
had
come
to
life
i
found
it
difficult
to
believe
she
was
the
same
woman
whose
fearful
effigy
had
floated
down
those
dreary
corridors
and
almost
disappeared
in
the
depths
of
that
atrocious
shadow
what
her
beliefs
were
now
i
was
wise
enough
to
leave
unquestioned
and
frances
to
my
great
relief
kept
the
conversation
well
away
from
such
inappropriate
topics
it
was
clear
however
that
the
woman
had
in
herself
some
secret
source
of
joy
that
she
was
now
an
aggressive
positive
force
sure
of
herself
and
apparently
afraid
of
nothing
in
heaven
or
hell
she
radiated
something
very
like
hope
and
courage
about
her
and
talked
as
though
the
world
were
a
glorious
place
and
everybody
in
it
kind
and
beautiful
her
optimism
was
certainly
infectious
the
towers
were
mentioned
only
in
passing
the
name
of
marsh
came
up
not
the
marsh
it
so
happened
but
a
name
in
some
book
that
was
being
discussed
and
i
was
unable
to
restrain
myself
curiosity
was
too
strong
i
threw
out
a
casual
enquiry
mabel
could
leave
unanswered
if
she
wished
but
there
was
no
desire
to
avoid
it
her
reply
was
frank
and
smiling
would
you
believe
it
she
married
mabel
told
me
though
obviously
surprised
that
i
remembered
the
housekeeper
at
all
and
is
happy
as
the
day
is
long
she
found
her
right
niche
in
life
a
sergeant
the
army
i
ejaculated
salvation
army
she
explained
merrily
frances
exchanged
a
glance
with
me
i
laughed
too
for
the
information
took
me
by
surprise
i
can
not
say
why
exactly
but
i
expected
at
least
to
hear
that
the
woman
had
met
some
dreadful
end
not
impossibly
by
burning
and
the
towers
now
called
the
rest
house
mabel
chattered
on
seems
to
me
the
most
peaceful
and
delightful
spot
in
england
really
i
said
politely
when
i
lived
there
in
the
old
days
while
you
were
there
perhaps
though
i
wo
be
sure
mabel
went
on
the
story
got
abroad
that
it
was
haunted
was
it
odd
a
less
likely
place
for
a
ghost
i
never
seen
why
it
had
no
atmosphere
at
all
she
said
this
to
frances
glancing
up
at
me
with
a
smile
that
apparently
had
no
hidden
meaning
did
you
notice
anything
queer
about
it
when
you
were
there
this
was
plainly
addressed
to
me
i
found
it
er
difficult
to
settle
down
to
anything
i
said
after
an
instant
hesitation
i
could
work
there
but
i
thought
you
wrote
that
wonderful
book
on
the
deaf
and
blind
while
you
stayed
with
me
she
asked
innocently
i
stammered
a
little
oh
no
not
then
i
only
made
a
few
notes
er
at
the
towers
my
mind
oddly
enough
refused
to
produce
at
all
down
there
but
why
do
you
ask
did
anything
was
anything
supposed
to
happen
there
she
looked
searchingly
into
my
eyes
a
moment
before
she
answered
not
that
i
know
of
she
said
simply
