extensive

did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the

on

was
renewed
just
speculate
for
a
moment
on
the
enormous
challenge
to
archeology
when
interplanetary
flight
is
possible
and
relics
are
found
of
a
race
extinct
for
half
a
million
years
a
race
incidentally
that
was
scientifically
so
far
in
advance
of
ours
that
they
held
the
secret
of
the
restoration
of
life
one
member
of
that
race
can
be
brought
back
after
years
of
death
that
the
story
told
by
this
original
novel
which
has
never
before
been
published
you
can
expect
a
adventure
in
the
future
when
you
read
it
out
beyond
the
orbit
of
mars
the
wallowed
cautiously
through
the
asteroid
fields
aboard
the
laboratory
ship
few
of
the
members
of
the
permanent
smithson
asteroidal
expedition
were
aware
that
they
were
in
motion
living
in
the
field
one
or
two
years
at
a
time
there
was
little
that
they
were
conscious
of
except
the
culture
whose
scattered
fragments
surrounded
them
on
every
side
the
only
contact
with
earth
at
the
moment
was
the
radio
link
by
which
delmar
underwood
was
calling
illia
morov
at
terrestrial
medical
central
illia
blonde
precisely
coiffured
hair
was
only
faintly
golden
against
the
stark
white
of
her
surgeons
gown
which
she
still
wore
when
she
answered
her
eyes
widened
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
as
her
face
came
into
focus
on
the
screen
and
she
recognized
underwood
del
i
thought
you
gone
to
sleep
with
the
mummies
out
there
been
over
a
month
since
you
called
what
new
not
much
terry
found
some
new
evidence
of
stroid
iii
phyfe
has
a
new
scrap
of
metal
with
inscriptions
and
they
found
something
that
almost
looks
as
if
it
might
have
been
an
electron
tube
five
hundred
thousand
years
ago
i
working
on
that
otherwise
all
is
peaceful
and
it
wonderful
still
the
confirmed
hermit
illia
eyes
lost
some
of
their
banter
but
none
of
their
tenderness
there
more
peace
and
contentment
out
here
than
i
ever
dreamed
of
finding
i
want
you
to
come
out
here
illia
come
out
for
a
month
if
you
do
want
to
stay
and
marry
me
then
you
can
go
back
and
i
say
another
word
she
shook
her
head
in
firm
decision
earth
needs
its
scientists
desperately
too
many
have
run
away
already
they
say
the
venusian
colonies
are
booming
but
i
told
you
a
year
ago
that
simply
running
away
would
work
i
thought
by
now
you
would
have
found
it
out
for
yourself
and
i
told
you
a
year
ago
underwood
said
flatly
that
the
only
possible
choice
of
a
sane
man
is
escape
you
ca
escape
your
own
culture
del
why
the
expedition
that
provided
the
opportunity
for
you
to
become
a
hermit
is
dependent
on
earth
if
congress
should
cut
the
institute
funds
you
be
dropped
right
back
where
you
were
you
ca
get
away
there
are
always
the
venusian
colonies
you
know
it
impossible
to
exist
there
independent
of
earth
i
not
talking
about
the
science
and
technology
i
talking
about
the
social
disintegration
certainly
a
scientist
does
need
to
take
that
with
him
when
he
attempting
to
escape
it
the
culture
is
not
to
blame
said
illia
earnestly
and
neither
is
humanity
you
do
ridicule
a
child
for
his
clumsiness
when
he
is
learning
to
walk
i
hope
the
human
race
is
past
its
childhood
relatively
speaking
it
is
dreyer
says
we
only
now
emerging
from
the
cave
man
stage
and
that
could
properly
be
called
infancy
i
suppose
dreyer
calls
it
the
man
stage
i
thought
he
was
a
semanticist
you
know
if
you
ever
talked
with
him
he
tear
off
every
other
word
you
utter
and
throw
it
back
at
you
his
man
designation
is
correct
all
right
according
to
him
human
beings
in
this
stage
need
some
leader
or
man
stronger
than
themselves
for
guidance
assumption
of
responsibility
and
blame
in
case
of
failure
of
the
group
these
functions
have
never
in
the
past
been
developed
in
the
individual
so
that
he
could
stand
alone
in
control
of
his
own
ego
but
it
coming
that
the
whole
import
of
dreyer
work
and
all
this
confusion
and
instability
are
supposed
to
have
something
to
do
with
that
it
been
growing
for
decades
we
seen
it
reach
a
peak
in
our
own
lifetimes
the
old
fetishes
have
failed
the
head
men
have
been
found
to
be
hollow
gods
and
men
faith
has
turned
to
derision
presidents
dictators
governors
and
priests
they
all
fallen
from
their
high
places
and
the
masses
of
humanity
will
no
longer
believe
in
any
of
them
and
is
development
of
the
race
yes
because
out
of
it
will
come
a
people
who
have
found
in
themselves
the
strength
they
used
to
find
in
the
men
there
will
come
a
race
in
which
the
individual
can
accept
the
responsibility
which
he
has
always
passed
on
to
the
man
the
man
is
no
longer
necessary
and
so
the
ultimate
anarchy
the
man
concept
has
but
first
he
has
to
find
out
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
government
with
human
beings
capable
of
independent
constructive
behavior
actual
democracy
will
be
possible
for
the
first
time
in
the
world
history
if
all
this
is
to
come
about
anyway
according
to
dreyer
why
not
try
to
escape
the
insanity
of
the
transition
period
illia
morov
eyes
grew
narrow
in
puzzlement
as
she
looked
at
underwood
with
utter
incomprehension
does
it
matter
at
all
that
the
race
is
in
one
of
the
greatest
crises
of
all
history
does
it
matter
that
you
have
a
skill
that
is
of
immense
value
in
these
times
it
peculiar
that
it
is
those
of
you
in
the
physical
sciences
who
are
fleeing
in
the
greatest
numbers
the
venusian
colonies
must
have
a
wonderful
time
with
physicists
trampling
each
other
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
earth
almost
barren
of
them
do
the
physical
sciences
destroy
every
sense
of
social
obligation
you
forget
that
i
do
quite
accept
dreyer
theories
to
me
this
is
nothing
but
a
rotting
structure
that
is
finally
collapsing
from
its
own
inner
decay
i
ca
see
anything
positive
evolving
out
of
it
i
suppose
so
well
it
was
nice
of
you
to
call
del
i
always
glad
to
hear
you
do
wait
so
long
next
time
illia
but
she
had
cut
the
connection
and
the
screen
slowly
faded
into
gray
leaving
underwood
argument
unfinished
irritably
he
flipped
the
switch
to
the
public
news
channels
where
was
he
wrong
the
past
year
since
he
had
joined
the
expedition
as
chief
physicist
was
like
paradise
compared
with
living
in
the
unstable
irresponsible
society
existing
on
earth
he
knew
it
was
a
purely
neurotic
reaction
this
desire
to
escape
but
application
of
that
label
solved
nothing
explained
nothing
and
carried
no
stigma
the
neurotic
reaction
was
the
norm
in
a
world
so
confused
he
turned
as
the
news
blared
abruptly
with
its
perpetual
urgency
that
made
him
wonder
how
the
commentators
endured
the
endless
flow
of
crises
the
president
had
been
impeached
again
the
third
one
in
six
months
there
were
no
candidates
for
his
office
a
church
had
been
burned
by
its
congregation
two
mayors
had
been
assassinated
within
hours
of
each
other
it
was
the
same
news
he
had
heard
six
months
ago
it
would
be
the
same
again
tomorrow
and
next
month
the
story
of
a
planet
repudiating
all
leadership
a
lawlessness
that
was
worse
than
anarchy
because
there
was
still
government
a
government
that
could
be
driven
and
whipped
by
the
insecurities
of
the
populace
that
elected
it
dreyer
called
it
a
futile
search
for
a
man
by
a
people
who
would
no
longer
trust
any
of
their
own
kind
to
be
man
and
underwood
dared
not
trust
that
glib
explanation
many
others
besides
underwood
found
they
could
no
longer
endure
the
instability
of
their
own
culture
among
these
were
many
of
the
leading
scientists
most
of
them
went
to
the
jungle
lands
of
venus
the
scientific
limitations
of
such
a
frontier
existence
had
kept
underwood
from
joining
the
venusian
colonies
but
he
been
very
close
to
going
just
before
he
got
the
offer
of
chief
physicist
with
the
smithson
institute
expedition
in
the
asteroid
fields
he
wondered
now
what
have
done
if
the
offer
had
come
the
interphone
annunciator
buzzed
underwood
turned
off
the
news
as
the
bored
communications
operator
in
the
control
room
announced
doc
underwood
call
for
doc
underwood
underwood
cut
in
speaking
he
said
irritably
the
voice
of
terry
bernard
burst
into
the
room
hey
del
are
you
going
to
get
rid
of
that
hangover
and
answer
your
phone
or
should
we
embalm
the
remains
and
ship
back
terry
you
fool
what
do
you
want
why
did
you
say
it
was
you
i
thought
maybe
it
was
that
maynes
with
chunks
of
mica
that
he
thought
were
prayer
sticks
the
stroids
did
use
prayer
sticks
all
right
skip
it
what
new
plenty
can
you
come
over
for
a
while
i
think
we
really
got
something
here
it
better
be
good
we
taking
the
ship
to
phyfe
where
are
you
asteroid
it
about
miles
from
you
and
bring
all
the
mining
tools
you
got
we
ca
get
into
this
thing
is
all
you
want
use
your
double
coated
drills
we
wore
five
of
them
out
no
scratches
on
the
thing
even
well
use
the
atom
stream
then
it
probably
wo
hurt
the
artifact
i
say
it
wo
it
wo
even
warm
the
thing
up
any
other
ideas
underwood
mind
which
had
been
half
occupied
with
mulling
over
his
personal
problems
while
he
talked
with
terry
swung
startledly
to
what
the
archeologist
was
saying
you
mean
that
you
found
a
material
the
atom
stream
wo
touch
that
impossible
the
equations
of
the
stream
prove
i
know
will
you
come
over
why
did
you
say
so
in
the
first
place
i
bring
the
whole
ship
underwood
cut
off
and
switched
to
the
captain
line
captain
dawson
underwood
will
you
please
take
the
ship
to
the
vicinity
of
asteroid
as
quickly
as
possible
i
thought
doctor
phyfe
i
answer
for
it
please
move
the
vessel
captain
dawson
acceded
his
instructions
were
to
place
the
ship
at
underwood
disposal
soundlessly
and
invisibly
the
distortion
fields
leaped
into
space
about
the
massive
laboratory
ship
and
the
moved
effortlessly
through
the
void
its
perfect
inertia
controls
left
no
evidence
of
its
motion
apparent
to
the
occupants
with
the
exception
of
the
navigators
and
pilots
the
hundreds
of
delicate
pieces
of
equipment
in
underwood
laboratories
remained
as
steadfast
as
if
anchored
to
tons
of
steel
and
concrete
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
earth
twenty
minutes
later
they
hove
in
sight
of
the
small
black
asteroid
that
glistened
in
the
faint
light
of
the
faraway
sun
the
spacesuited
figures
of
terry
bernard
and
his
assistant
batch
fagin
clung
to
the
surface
moving
about
like
flies
on
a
blackened
frozen
apple
underwood
was
already
in
the
scooter
lock
astride
the
little
spacescooter
which
they
used
for
transportation
between
ships
of
the
expedition
and
between
asteroids
the
pilot
jockeyed
the
as
near
as
safely
desirable
then
signaled
underwood
the
physicist
pressed
the
control
that
opened
the
lock
in
the
side
of
the
vessel
the
scooter
shot
out
into
space
bearing
him
astride
it
ride
cowboy
terry
bernard
yelled
into
the
intercom
he
gave
a
wild
cowboy
yell
that
pierced
underwood
ears
watch
out
that
thing
does
turn
turtle
with
you
underwood
grinned
to
himself
he
said
your
attitude
convinces
me
of
a
long
held
theory
that
archeology
is
no
science
anyway
if
your
story
of
a
material
impervious
to
the
atom
stream
is
wrong
you
better
get
a
good
alibi
phyfe
had
some
work
he
wanted
to
do
aboard
today
come
and
see
for
yourself
this
is
it
as
the
scooter
approached
closer
to
the
asteroid
underwood
could
glimpse
the
strangeness
of
the
thing
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
coated
with
the
usual
asteroid
material
of
nickel
iron
debris
but
terry
had
cleared
this
away
from
more
than
half
the
surface
the
exposed
half
was
a
shining
thing
of
ebony
whose
planes
and
angles
were
machined
with
mathematical
exactness
it
looked
as
if
there
were
at
least
a
thousand
individual
facets
on
the
one
hemisphere
alone
at
the
sight
of
it
underwood
could
almost
understand
the
thrill
of
discovery
that
impelled
these
archeologists
to
delve
in
the
mysteries
of
space
for
lost
kingdoms
and
races
this
object
which
terry
had
discovered
was
a
magnificent
artifact
he
wondered
how
long
it
had
circled
the
sun
since
the
intelligence
that
formed
it
had
died
he
wished
now
that
terry
had
not
used
the
atom
stream
for
that
had
probably
destroyed
the
validity
of
the
relationship
in
the
coating
of
debris
that
might
otherwise
indicate
something
of
the
age
of
the
thing
terry
sensed
something
of
underwood
awe
in
his
silence
as
he
approached
what
do
you
think
of
it
del
it
beautiful
said
underwood
have
you
any
clue
to
what
it
is
not
a
thing
no
marks
of
any
kind
on
it
the
scooter
slowed
as
del
underwood
guided
it
near
the
surface
of
the
asteroid
it
touched
gently
and
he
unstrapped
himself
and
stepped
off
phyfe
will
forgive
all
your
sins
for
this
he
said
before
you
show
me
the
atom
stream
is
ineffective
let
break
off
a
couple
of
tons
of
the
coating
and
put
it
in
the
ship
we
may
be
able
to
date
the
thing
yet
almost
all
these
asteroids
have
a
small
amount
of
radioactivity
somewhere
in
them
we
can
chip
some
from
the
opposite
side
where
the
atom
stream
would
affect
it
least
good
idea
terry
agreed
i
should
have
thought
of
that
but
when
i
first
found
the
single
outcropping
of
machined
metal
i
figured
it
was
very
small
after
i
found
the
atom
stream
would
touch
it
i
was
overanxious
to
undercover
it
i
did
realize
i
have
to
burn
away
the
whole
surface
of
the
asteroid
we
may
as
well
finish
the
job
and
get
it
completely
uncovered
have
some
of
my
men
from
the
ship
come
on
over
it
took
the
better
part
of
an
hour
to
chip
and
drill
away
samples
to
be
used
in
a
dating
attempt
then
the
intense
fire
of
the
atom
stream
was
turned
upon
the
remainder
of
the
asteroid
to
clear
it
we
better
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
soft
spot
terry
suggested
possible
this
thing
is
homogeneous
and
papa
phyfe
would
be
very
mad
if
we
burned
it
up
after
making
such
a
find
from
behind
his
heavy
shield
which
protected
him
from
the
stray
radiation
formed
by
the
atom
stream
delmar
underwood
watched
the
biting
fire
cut
between
the
gemlike
artifact
and
the
metallic
alloys
that
coated
it
the
alloys
cracked
and
fell
away
in
large
chunks
propelled
by
the
explosions
of
matter
as
the
intense
heat
vaporized
the
metal
almost
instantly
the
spell
of
the
ancient
and
the
unknown
fell
upon
him
and
swept
him
up
in
the
old
mysteries
and
the
unknown
tongues
trained
in
the
precise
methods
of
the
physical
sciences
he
had
long
fought
against
the
fascination
of
the
immense
puzzles
which
the
archeologists
were
trying
to
solve
but
no
man
could
long
escape
in
the
quiet
starlit
blackness
there
rang
the
ancient
memories
of
a
planet
vibrant
with
life
a
planet
of
strange
tongues
and
unknown
songs
a
planet
that
had
died
so
violently
that
space
was
yet
strewn
with
its
remains
so
violently
that
somewhere
the
echo
of
its
death
explosion
must
yet
ring
in
the
far
vaults
of
space
underwood
had
always
thought
of
archeologists
as
befogged
antiquarians
poking
among
ancient
graves
and
rubbish
heaps
but
now
he
knew
them
for
what
they
were
poets
in
search
of
mysteries
the
of
phyfe
and
the
swearing
of
terry
bernard
were
merely
thin
disguises
for
their
poetic
romanticism
underwood
watched
the
white
fire
of
the
atom
stream
through
the
lead
glass
of
the
lenses
i
talked
to
illia
today
he
said
she
says
i
run
away
have
you
terry
asked
i
would
call
it
that
it
does
make
much
difference
what
you
call
it
i
once
lived
in
an
apartment
underneath
a
french
horn
player
who
practised
eight
hours
a
day
i
ran
away
if
the
whole
mess
back
on
earth
is
like
a
bunch
of
horn
blowers
tootling
above
your
apartment
i
say
move
and
why
make
any
fuss
about
it
i
probably
join
the
boys
on
venus
myself
if
my
job
did
keep
me
out
here
of
course
it
different
with
you
illia
to
be
convinced
along
with
your
own
conscience
she
quotes
dreyer
he
one
of
your
ideals
is
he
no
better
semanticist
ever
lived
terry
said
flatly
he
takes
the
long
view
which
is
that
everything
will
come
out
in
the
wash
i
agree
with
him
so
why
worry
knowing
that
the
variants
will
iron
themselves
out
and
nothing
i
can
possibly
do
will
be
noticed
or
missed
hence
i
seldom
worry
about
my
obligations
to
mankind
as
long
as
i
stay
reasonably
do
likewise
brother
del
and
you
live
longer
or
at
least
more
happily
underwood
grinned
in
the
blinding
glare
of
the
atom
stream
he
wished
life
were
as
simple
as
terry
would
have
him
believe
maybe
it
would
be
he
thought
if
it
were
for
illia
as
he
moved
his
shield
slowly
forward
behind
the
crumbling
debris
underwood
mind
returned
to
the
question
of
who
created
the
structure
beneath
their
feet
and
to
what
alien
purpose
its
black
impenetrable
surfaces
spoke
of
excellent
mechanical
skill
and
a
high
science
that
could
create
a
material
refractory
to
the
atom
stream
who
a
half
million
years
ago
could
have
created
it
the
ancient
bode
law
had
indicated
a
missing
planet
which
could
easily
have
fitted
into
the
solar
system
in
the
vicinity
of
the
asteroid
belt
but
bode
law
had
never
been
accepted
by
astronomers
until
interstellar
archeology
discovered
the
artifacts
of
a
civilization
on
many
of
the
asteroids
the
monumental
task
of
exploration
had
been
undertaken
more
than
a
generation
ago
by
the
smithson
institute
though
always
handicapped
by
shortage
of
funds
they
had
managed
to
keep
at
least
one
ship
in
the
field
as
a
permanent
expedition
phyfe
leader
of
the
present
group
was
probably
the
greatest
student
of
asteroidal
archeology
in
the
system
the
younger
archeologists
labeled
him
benevolently
papa
phyfe
in
spite
of
the
irascible
temper
which
came
perhaps
from
constantly
switching
his
mind
from
half
a
million
years
ago
to
the
present
in
their
use
of
semantic
correlations
underwood
was
discovering
the
archeologists
were
far
ahead
of
the
physical
scientists
for
they
had
an
immensely
greater
task
in
deducing
the
mental
concepts
of
alien
races
from
a
few
scraps
of
machinery
and
art
of
all
the
archeologists
he
had
met
underwood
had
taken
the
greatest
liking
to
terry
bernard
an
extremely
competent
semanticist
and
archeologist
terry
nevertheless
did
not
take
himself
too
seriously
he
did
not
even
mind
underwood
constant
assertion
that
archeology
was
no
science
he
maintained
that
it
was
fun
and
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
at
last
the
two
groups
approached
each
other
from
opposite
sides
of
the
asteroid
and
joined
forces
in
shearing
off
the
last
of
the
debris
as
they
shut
off
the
fearful
atom
streams
the
scientists
turned
to
look
back
at
the
thing
they
had
cleared
terry
said
quietly
see
why
i
an
archeologist
i
think
i
do
almost
underwood
answered
the
gemlike
structure
beneath
their
feet
glistened
like
polished
ebony
it
caught
the
distant
stars
in
its
thousand
facets
and
cast
them
until
it
gleamed
as
if
with
infinite
lights
of
its
own
the
workmen
too
were
caught
in
its
spell
for
they
stood
silently
contemplating
the
mystery
of
a
people
who
had
created
such
beauty
the
spell
was
broken
at
last
by
a
movement
across
the
heavens
underwood
glanced
up
papa
phyfe
coming
on
the
warpath
i
bet
he
ready
to
trim
my
ears
for
taking
the
lab
ship
without
his
consent
you
boss
of
the
lab
ship
are
you
said
terry
it
a
rather
flexible
arrangement
in
phyfe
mind
at
least
boss
until
he
decides
he
wants
to
do
something
the
headquarters
ship
slowed
to
a
halt
and
the
lock
opened
emitting
the
fiery
burst
of
a
motor
scooter
which
doc
phyfe
rode
with
angry
abandon
you
underwood
his
voice
came
harshly
through
the
phones
i
demand
an
explanation
of
that
was
as
far
as
he
got
for
he
glimpsed
the
thing
upon
which
the
men
were
standing
and
from
his
vantage
point
it
looked
all
the
more
like
a
black
jewel
in
the
sky
he
became
instantly
once
more
the
eager
archeologist
instead
of
expedition
administrator
a
role
he
filled
with
irritation
what
have
you
got
there
he
whispered
terry
answered
we
do
know
i
asked
underwood
assistance
in
uncovering
the
artifact
if
it
caused
you
any
difficulty
i
sorry
it
my
fault
pah
said
phyfe
a
thing
like
this
is
of
utmost
importance
you
should
have
notified
me
immediately
terry
and
underwood
grinned
at
each
other
phyfe
reprimanded
every
archeologist
on
the
expedition
for
not
notifying
him
immediately
whenever
anything
from
the
smallest
machined
fragment
of
metal
to
the
greatest
stone
monuments
were
found
if
they
had
obeyed
he
would
have
done
nothing
but
travel
from
asteroid
to
asteroid
over
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
of
space
you
were
busy
with
your
own
work
said
terry
but
phyfe
had
landed
and
as
he
dismounted
from
the
scooter
he
stood
in
awe
terry
standing
close
to
him
thought
he
saw
tears
in
the
old
man
eyes
through
the
helmet
of
the
spaceship
it
beautiful
murmured
phyfe
in
worshipping
awe
wonderful
the
most
magnificent
find
in
a
century
of
asteroidal
archeology
we
must
make
arrangements
for
its
transfer
to
earth
at
once
if
i
may
make
a
suggestion
said
terry
you
recall
that
some
of
the
artifacts
have
not
survived
so
well
decay
in
many
instances
has
set
in
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
this
thing
can
decay
phyfe
little
gray
van
dyke
trembled
violently
i
thinking
of
the
thermal
transfer
doctor
underwood
is
better
able
to
discuss
that
but
i
should
think
that
a
mass
of
this
kind
which
is
at
absolute
zero
might
undergo
unusual
stresses
in
coming
to
earth
normal
temperatures
true
we
used
the
atom
stream
on
it
but
that
heat
did
not
penetrate
enough
to
set
up
great
internal
stresses
phyfe
looked
hesitant
and
turned
to
underwood
what
is
your
opinion
underwood
did
get
it
until
he
caught
terry
wink
behind
back
once
it
left
space
and
went
into
the
museum
laboratory
terry
might
never
get
to
work
on
the
thing
again
that
was
the
perpetual
gripe
of
the
field
men
i
think
doctor
bernard
has
a
good
point
said
underwood
i
would
advise
leaving
the
artifact
here
in
space
until
a
thorough
examination
has
been
made
after
all
we
have
every
facility
aboard
the
that
is
available
on
earth
very
well
said
phyfe
you
may
proceed
in
charge
of
the
physical
examination
of
the
find
doctor
underwood
you
doctor
bernard
will
be
in
charge
of
proceedings
from
an
archeological
standpoint
will
that
be
satisfactory
to
everyone
concerned
it
was
far
more
than
terry
had
expected
i
will
be
on
constant
call
said
phyfe
let
me
know
immediately
of
any
developments
then
the
uncertain
mask
of
the
executive
fell
away
from
the
face
of
the
little
old
scientist
and
he
regarded
the
find
with
humility
and
awe
it
beautiful
he
murmured
again
phyfe
remained
near
the
site
as
underwood
and
terry
set
their
crew
to
the
routine
task
of
weighing
measuring
and
photographing
the
object
while
underwood
considered
what
else
to
do
you
know
this
thing
has
got
me
stymied
terry
since
it
ca
be
touched
by
an
atom
stream
that
means
there
is
a
single
analytical
procedure
to
which
it
will
respond
that
i
know
of
anyway
does
your
knowledge
of
the
stroids
and
their
ways
of
doing
things
suggest
any
identification
of
it
terry
shook
his
head
as
he
stood
by
the
port
of
the
laboratory
ship
watching
the
crews
at
work
outside
not
a
thing
but
that
no
criterion
we
know
so
little
about
the
stroids
that
almost
everything
we
find
has
a
function
we
never
heard
of
before
and
of
course
we
found
many
objects
with
totally
unknown
functions
i
been
thinking
what
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
merely
a
natural
gem
from
the
interior
of
the
planet
maybe
formed
at
the
time
of
its
destruction
but
at
least
an
entirely
natural
object
rather
than
an
artifact
it
would
be
the
largest
crystal
formation
ever
encountered
and
the
most
perfect
i
say
the
chances
of
its
natural
formation
are
negligible
but
maybe
this
is
the
one
in
a
hundred
billion
billion
or
whatever
number
chance
it
may
be
if
so
its
value
ought
to
be
enough
to
balance
the
terrestrial
budget
i
still
convinced
that
it
must
be
an
artifact
though
its
material
and
use
are
beyond
me
we
can
start
with
a
radiation
analysis
perhaps
it
will
respond
in
some
way
that
will
give
us
a
clue
when
the
crew
had
finished
the
routine
check
underwood
directed
his
men
to
set
up
the
various
types
of
radiation
equipment
contained
within
the
ship
it
was
possible
to
generate
radiation
through
almost
the
complete
spectrum
from
single
cycle
sound
waves
to
hard
cosmic
rays
the
work
was
arduous
and
detailed
each
radiator
was
slowly
driven
through
its
range
then
removed
and
higher
frequency
equipment
used
at
each
fraction
of
an
octave
the
object
was
carefully
photographed
to
record
its
response
after
watching
the
work
for
two
days
terry
wearied
of
the
seemingly
labor
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
doing
del
he
said
but
is
it
getting
you
anywhere
at
all
underwood
shook
his
head
here
the
batch
of
photographs
probably
want
them
to
illustrate
your
report
the
surfaces
of
the
object
are
mathematically
exact
to
a
thousandth
of
a
millimeter
believe
me
that
some
tolerance
on
an
object
of
this
size
the
surfaces
are
of
number
fifteen
smoothness
which
means
they
are
plane
within
a
of
a
millimeter
the
implications
are
obvious
the
builders
who
constructed
that
were
mechanical
geniuses
did
you
get
any
radioactive
dating
rather
doubtfully
but
the
indications
are
around
half
a
million
years
that
checks
with
what
we
know
about
the
stroids
it
would
appear
that
their
culture
is
about
on
a
par
with
our
own
personally
i
think
they
were
ahead
of
us
said
terry
and
do
you
see
what
that
means
to
us
archeologists
it
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
science
that
we
had
to
deal
with
the
remains
of
a
civilization
either
equal
or
superior
to
our
own
the
problems
are
multiplied
a
thousand
times
when
you
try
to
take
a
step
up
instead
of
a
step
down
any
idea
of
what
the
stroids
looked
like
we
have
found
any
bodies
skeletons
or
even
pictures
but
we
think
they
were
at
least
roughly
anthropomorphic
they
were
farther
from
the
sun
than
we
but
it
was
younger
then
and
probably
gave
them
about
the
same
amount
of
heat
their
planet
was
larger
and
the
stroids
appear
to
have
been
somewhat
larger
as
individuals
than
we
judging
from
the
artifacts
we
discovered
but
they
seem
to
have
had
a
suitable
atmosphere
of
oxygen
diluted
with
appropriate
inert
gases
they
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
laboratory
technician
who
brought
in
a
dry
photographic
print
still
warm
from
the
developing
box
he
laid
it
on
the
desk
before
underwood
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
in
this
underwood
and
terry
glanced
at
it
the
picture
was
of
the
huge
gemlike
artifact
but
a
number
of
the
facets
seemed
to
be
covered
with
intricate
markings
of
short
wavy
lines
underwood
stared
closer
at
the
thing
what
the
devil
are
those
we
took
pictures
of
every
facet
previously
and
there
was
nothing
like
this
get
me
an
enlargement
of
these
i
already
have
the
assistant
laid
another
photo
on
the
desk
showing
the
pattern
of
markings
as
if
at
close
range
they
were
clearly
discernible
now
what
do
you
make
of
it
asked
underwood
i
say
it
looked
like
writing
terry
said
but
it
not
like
any
of
the
other
stroid
characters
i
seen
which
does
mean
much
of
course
because
there
could
be
thousands
that
i
never
seen
only
how
come
these
characters
are
there
now
and
we
never
noticed
them
before
let
go
out
and
have
a
look
said
underwood
he
grasped
the
photograph
and
noted
the
numbers
of
the
facets
on
which
the
characters
appeared
in
a
few
moments
the
two
men
were
speeding
toward
the
surface
of
their
discovery
astride
scooters
they
jockeyed
above
the
facets
shown
on
the
photographs
and
stared
in
vain
something
the
matter
said
terry
i
do
see
anything
here
let
go
all
the
way
around
on
the
scooters
those
guys
may
have
bungled
the
job
of
numbering
the
photos
they
began
a
slow
circuit
making
certain
they
glimpsed
all
the
facets
from
a
height
of
only
ten
feet
it
not
here
underwood
agreed
at
last
let
talk
to
the
crew
that
took
the
shots
they
headed
towards
the
equipment
platform
floating
in
free
space
from
which
mason
one
of
the
senior
physicists
was
directing
operations
mason
signaled
for
the
radiations
to
be
cut
off
as
the
men
approached
find
any
clues
chief
he
asked
underwood
we
done
our
best
to
fry
this
apple
but
nothing
happens
something
happen
did
you
see
it
underwood
extended
the
photograph
with
the
mechanical
fingers
of
the
spacesuit
mason
held
it
in
a
light
and
stared
at
it
we
did
see
a
thing
like
that
and
we
could
have
missed
it
he
turned
to
the
members
of
the
crew
anyone
see
this
writing
on
the
thing
they
looked
at
the
picture
and
shook
their
heads
what
were
you
shooting
on
it
at
the
time
mason
glanced
at
his
records
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
angstroms
so
there
must
be
something
that
becomes
visible
only
in
a
field
of
radiation
of
about
that
wave
length
said
underwood
keep
going
and
see
if
anything
else
turns
up
or
if
this
proves
to
be
permanent
after
exposure
to
that
frequency
back
in
the
laboratory
they
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
went
through
the
file
of
hundreds
of
photographs
that
were
now
pouring
out
of
the
darkroom
not
a
thing
except
that
one
said
terry
it
looks
like
a
message
intended
only
for
someone
who
knew
what
frequency
would
make
it
visible
underwood
shook
his
head
that
sounds
a
little
too
melodramatic
for
me
yet
it
is
possible
that
this
thing
is
some
kind
of
repository
and
we
found
the
key
to
it
but
what
a
key
it
looks
as
if
we
got
to
decipher
the
language
of
the
stroids
in
order
to
use
the
key
the
best
men
in
the
field
have
been
trying
to
do
that
for
only
about
years
if
that
what
it
takes
we
may
as
well
quit
right
now
you
said
that
this
was
nothing
like
any
other
stroid
characters
that
you
had
seen
maybe
this
belongs
to
a
different
cultural
stratum
it
might
prove
easier
to
crack
who
the
best
man
in
the
field
on
this
stuff
dreyer
at
the
semantics
lab
he
wo
touch
it
any
more
he
says
wasted
fifteen
years
of
his
life
on
the
stroid
inscriptions
i
bet
he
will
tackle
this
if
it
as
new
as
you
think
it
is
seen
some
of
those
antiquarians
before
we
get
phyfe
to
transmit
some
copies
of
this
to
him
who
the
next
best
man
probably
phyfe
himself
it
wo
be
hard
to
get
him
started
on
it
i
bet
it
was
the
old
scientist
was
ecstatic
over
the
discovery
of
the
inscriptions
upon
the
huge
gem
he
took
copies
of
the
pictures
into
his
study
and
spent
two
full
days
comparing
them
with
the
known
records
it
an
entirely
new
set
of
characters
he
said
after
completing
the
preliminary
examination
we
already
have
three
sets
of
characters
that
seem
to
be
in
no
way
related
this
is
the
fourth
you
sent
copies
to
dreyer
only
because
you
requested
it
dreyer
admitted
long
ago
that
he
was
licked
during
the
week
of
phyfe
study
the
work
of
radiation
analysis
had
been
completed
it
proved
completely
negative
with
the
single
exception
of
the
radiation
which
rendered
visible
the
characters
on
the
gem
no
secondary
effects
of
any
significance
whatever
had
been
noted
the
material
reflected
almost
completely
nearly
every
frequency
imposed
upon
it
thus
underwood
found
himself
again
at
the
end
of
his
resources
it
was
impossible
to
analyze
material
that
refused
to
react
which
was
refractive
to
every
force
applied
underwood
told
terry
at
the
conclusion
of
a
series
of
chemical
tests
if
you
want
to
keep
that
thing
out
here
any
longer
i
afraid
you
got
to
think
of
some
more
effective
way
of
examining
it
than
i
have
been
able
to
do
from
a
physical
standpoint
this
artifact
is
in
about
the
same
position
as
the
language
of
the
stroids
had
been
semantically
completely
intractable
i
not
afraid
of
its
being
sent
back
to
the
museum
now
papa
got
his
teeth
into
it
and
he
wo
let
go
until
he
cracks
the
key
to
this
lingo
underwood
did
believe
that
it
would
ever
be
solved
unless
by
some
lucky
chance
they
came
upon
a
sort
of
rosetta
stone
which
would
bridge
the
gap
between
the
human
mind
and
that
of
the
alien
stroids
even
if
the
stroids
were
somewhat
anthropomorphic
in
makeup
as
the
archeologists
believed
there
was
no
indication
that
their
minds
would
not
be
so
utterly
alien
that
no
bridge
would
even
be
possible
underwood
felt
seriously
inclined
to
abandon
the
problem
while
completely
fascinating
it
was
hardly
more
soluble
than
was
the
problem
of
the
composition
of
the
stars
in
the
days
before
the
spectroscope
was
invented
neither
the
archeologists
the
semanticists
nor
the
physicists
yet
had
the
tools
to
crack
the
problem
of
the
stroids
until
the
tools
became
available
the
problem
would
simply
have
to
go
by
the
boards
the
only
exception
was
the
remote
possibility
of
a
deliberate
clue
left
by
the
stroids
themselves
but
underwood
did
not
believe
in
miracles
his
final
conviction
came
when
word
came
back
from
dreyer
who
said
congratulations
phyfe
and
returned
the
copies
of
the
stroid
characters
with
a
short
note
well
that
does
it
said
underwood
phyfe
was
dismayed
by
dreyer
reply
the
man
simply
trying
to
uphold
a
decaying
reputation
by
claiming
the
problem
ca
be
solved
send
it
to
the
museum
and
let
them
begin
work
on
it
i
give
it
my
entire
time
you
will
help
me
if
you
will
doctor
bernard
terry
himself
was
becoming
somewhat
dismayed
by
the
magnitude
of
the
mystery
they
had
uncovered
he
knew
phyfe
bulldog
tenacity
when
he
tackled
something
and
he
did
want
to
be
tied
to
semantics
for
the
rest
of
the
term
of
the
expedition
underwood
however
had
become
immersed
in
work
attempting
to
determine
the
molecular
structure
of
the
artifact
from
a
crystallographic
standpoint
to
find
out
if
it
could
be
found
it
might
be
possible
to
disrupt
the
pattern
after
he
had
been
at
it
for
about
a
week
terry
came
into
the
lab
in
a
disgruntled
mood
at
the
completion
of
a
work
period
you
look
as
if
papa
gave
you
a
spanking
said
underwood
why
the
downcast
mood
i
think
i
resign
and
go
back
to
the
museum
it
useless
to
work
on
this
puzzle
any
longer
how
do
you
know
because
it
does
follow
the
laws
of
semantics
with
respect
to
language
maybe
the
laws
need
changing
you
know
better
than
that
look
you
are
as
familiar
with
law
as
i
am
it
states
that
in
any
language
there
is
bound
to
be
a
certain
constant
frequency
of
semantic
conceptions
it
like
the
old
frequency
laws
that
used
to
be
used
in
cryptographic
analysis
except
a
thousand
times
more
complex
anyway
we
made
thousands
of
substitutions
into
carnovan
frequency
scale
and
nothing
comes
out
not
a
thing
no
concept
of
ego
identity
perfection
retrogression
or
intercourse
shows
up
the
only
thing
that
registers
in
the
slightest
degree
is
the
concept
of
motion
but
it
does
yield
a
single
key
word
it
almost
as
if
it
were
even
a
language
maybe
it
is
what
else
could
it
be
well
maybe
this
thing
we
found
is
a
monument
of
some
kind
and
the
inscriptions
are
ritualistic
tributes
to
dead
heroes
or
something
maybe
there
no
trick
at
all
about
the
radiation
business
maybe
they
used
that
frequency
for
common
illumination
and
the
inscription
was
arranged
to
show
up
just
at
night
the
trouble
with
you
strict
semanticists
is
that
you
do
use
any
imagination
like
to
try
a
hand
at
a
few
sessions
with
papa
phyfe
no
thanks
but
i
do
think
there
are
other
possibilities
that
you
are
overlooking
i
make
no
claim
to
being
anything
but
a
strictly
ham
semanticist
but
suppose
for
example
that
the
inscriptions
are
not
language
at
all
in
the
common
sense
they
must
represent
transfer
of
thought
in
some
form
true
but
look
at
the
varied
forms
of
thought
you
are
bound
down
to
the
conception
of
language
held
as
far
back
as
korzybski
at
least
to
the
conception
held
by
those
who
did
fully
understand
korzybski
you
have
considered
the
concept
of
music
it
a
very
real
possibility
but
one
which
would
remain
meaningless
without
the
instrument
consider
also
wait
a
minute
terry
we
all
been
a
bunch
of
thoroughbred
dopes
what
is
it
look
at
the
geometrical
and
mechanical
perfection
of
the
artifact
that
implies
mathematical
knowledge
of
a
high
order
the
inscriptions
could
be
mathematical
measurements
of
some
kind
that
would
explain
the
breakdown
of
carnovan
principles
they
do
apply
to
math
but
what
kind
of
math
would
be
inscribed
on
a
thing
like
that
who
knows
we
can
give
it
a
try
it
was
the
beginning
of
their
sleeping
period
but
terry
was
fired
with
underwood
sudden
enthusiasm
he
brought
in
a
complete
copy
of
all
the
inscriptions
found
upon
the
facets
of
the
black
gem
underwood
placed
them
on
a
large
table
in
continuous
order
as
they
appeared
around
the
circumference
it
mud
to
me
said
terry
i
the
world
worst
mathematician
look
exclaimed
underwood
here
the
beginning
of
it
he
suddenly
moved
some
of
the
sheets
so
that
one
previously
in
the
middle
formed
the
beginning
of
the
sequence
what
does
it
look
like
to
you
i
seen
that
until
i
dream
of
it
it
one
phyfe
tried
to
make
the
most
of
in
his
frequency
determinations
it
looks
like
nothing
more
than
some
widgets
alongside
a
triangle
that
exactly
what
it
is
and
no
wonder
phyfe
found
it
had
a
high
frequency
that
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
explanation
of
the
stroid
concept
of
the
differential
this
widget
over
here
must
be
the
sign
of
the
derivative
corresponding
to
our
hastily
underwood
scrawled
some
symbols
on
a
scratch
pad
using
combinations
of
x
s
and
y
s
and
the
strange
unknown
symbols
of
the
stroids
it
checks
they
showing
us
how
to
differentiate
not
only
that
we
have
the
key
to
their
numerical
system
in
the
exponentials
because
they
given
us
the
differentiation
of
a
whole
series
of
power
expressions
here
now
somewhere
we
ought
to
find
an
integral
expression
which
we
could
check
back
with
differentiation
here
it
is
terry
left
behind
now
went
to
the
galley
and
brewed
a
steaming
pot
of
coffee
and
brought
it
back
he
found
underwood
staring
unseeingly
ahead
of
him
into
the
dark
empty
corners
of
the
lab
what
is
it
terry
exclaimed
what
have
you
found
i
not
sure
do
you
know
what
the
end
product
of
all
this
math
is
what
a
set
of
wave
equations
but
such
wave
equations
as
any
physicist
would
be
thought
crazy
to
dream
up
yet
in
light
of
some
new
manipulations
introduced
by
the
stroids
they
seem
feasible
what
can
we
do
with
them
we
can
build
a
generator
and
see
what
kind
of
stuff
comes
out
of
it
when
we
operate
it
according
to
this
math
the
stroids
obviously
intended
that
someone
find
this
and
learn
to
produce
the
radiation
described
for
what
purpose
we
can
only
guess
but
we
might
find
out
do
we
have
enough
equipment
aboard
to
build
such
a
generator
i
think
so
we
could
cannibalize
enough
from
equipment
we
already
have
on
hand
let
try
it
terry
hesitated
i
not
quite
sure
but
well
this
stuff
comes
about
as
near
as
anything
i
ever
saw
to
giving
me
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
creeps
somehow
these
stroids
seem
too
too
that
sounds
crazy
i
know
but
there
such
alienness
here
nuts
let
build
their
generator
and
see
what
they
trying
to
tell
us
phyfe
was
exuberant
he
not
only
gave
permission
to
construct
the
generator
he
demanded
that
all
work
aboard
the
lab
ship
give
priority
to
the
new
project
the
design
of
the
machine
was
no
easy
task
for
underwood
was
a
physicist
and
not
an
engineer
however
he
had
two
men
moody
and
hansen
in
his
staff
who
were
first
rate
engineers
on
them
fell
the
chief
burden
of
design
after
underwood
worked
out
the
rough
specifications
one
of
the
main
laboratories
with
nearly
ten
thousand
square
feet
of
floor
space
was
cleared
for
the
project
as
the
specifications
flowed
from
underwood
desk
they
passed
over
to
moody
and
hansen
and
from
there
out
to
the
lab
where
the
mass
of
equipment
was
gathered
from
all
parts
of
the
fleet
an
atomic
power
supply
sufficient
to
give
the
large
amount
of
energy
required
by
the
generator
was
obtained
by
robbing
the
headquarters
ship
of
its
auxiliary
supply
converter
units
were
available
in
the
itself
but
the
main
radiator
tubes
had
to
be
cannibalized
from
the
a
equipment
aboard
slowly
the
mass
of
improvised
equipment
grew
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
task
on
earth
with
all
facilities
available
for
such
a
project
but
with
these
makeshift
arrangements
it
was
a
miracle
that
the
generator
continued
to
develop
a
score
of
times
underwood
had
to
make
compromises
that
he
hoped
would
not
alter
the
characteristics
of
the
wave
which
two
weeks
before
he
would
have
declared
impossible
to
generate
when
the
equipment
was
completed
and
ready
for
a
trial
check
the
huge
lab
was
a
mass
of
into
which
no
one
but
moody
and
hansen
dared
go
the
completion
was
an
the
great
project
that
had
almost
halted
all
other
field
work
was
finished
and
no
one
knew
what
to
expect
when
hansen
threw
the
switch
that
fed
power
from
the
converters
into
the
giant
tubes
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
happened
only
the
faint
whine
of
the
converters
and
the
swinging
needles
of
meters
strung
all
over
the
room
showed
that
the
beam
was
in
operation
on
the
nose
of
the
was
the
great
ungainly
radiator
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
which
was
spraying
the
unknown
depths
of
space
with
the
newly
created
power
underwood
and
terry
were
outside
the
ship
behind
the
huge
radiator
with
a
mass
of
equipment
designed
to
observe
the
effects
of
the
beam
in
space
it
was
totally
invisible
creating
no
detectable
field
it
seemed
as
inactive
as
a
beam
of
ultraviolet
piercing
the
starlit
darkness
underwood
picked
up
the
interphone
that
connected
them
with
the
interior
of
the
ship
swing
around
please
captain
dawson
let
the
beam
rotate
through
a
one
hundred
and
eighty
degree
arc
the
captain
ordered
the
ship
around
and
the
great
swung
on
its
own
axis
but
not
in
the
direction
underwood
had
had
in
mind
he
failed
to
indicate
the
direction
and
dawson
had
assumed
it
matter
ponderously
the
great
radiator
swung
about
before
underwood
could
shout
a
warning
and
the
beam
came
directly
in
line
with
the
mysterious
gem
of
the
universe
which
they
had
found
in
the
heart
of
the
asteroid
at
once
the
heavens
were
filled
with
intolerable
light
terry
and
underwood
flung
themselves
down
upon
the
hull
of
the
ship
and
the
physicist
screamed
into
the
phones
for
dawson
to
swing
the
other
way
but
his
warnings
were
in
vain
for
those
within
the
ship
were
blinded
by
the
great
flare
of
light
that
penetrated
even
the
protective
ports
of
the
ship
irresistibly
the
continued
to
swing
spraying
the
great
gem
with
its
mysterious
radiation
then
it
was
past
and
the
beam
cut
into
space
once
more
on
top
of
the
ship
underwood
and
terry
found
their
sight
slowly
returning
they
had
been
saved
the
full
blast
of
the
light
from
the
gem
by
the
curve
of
the
ship
hull
which
cut
it
off
underwood
stumbled
to
his
feet
followed
by
terry
the
two
men
stood
in
at
the
vision
that
met
their
eyes
where
the
gem
had
drifted
in
space
there
was
now
a
blistered
boiling
mass
of
amorphous
matter
that
surged
and
steamed
in
the
void
all
semblance
to
the
glistening
faceted
ebon
gem
was
gone
as
the
repulsive
mass
heaved
within
itself
it
destroyed
terry
exclaimed
hoarsely
the
greatest
archeological
find
of
all
time
and
we
destroy
it
before
we
find
out
anything
about
it
shut
up
underwood
commanded
harshly
he
tried
to
concentrate
on
the
happenings
before
him
but
he
could
find
no
meaning
in
it
he
bemoaned
the
fact
that
he
had
no
camera
and
only
prayed
that
someone
inside
would
have
the
wit
to
turn
one
on
as
the
ship
continued
its
slow
swing
like
a
senseless
animal
the
pulsing
of
the
amorphous
mass
that
had
been
the
jewel
slowly
ceased
and
out
of
the
gray
murkiness
of
it
came
a
new
quality
it
began
to
regain
rigidity
and
transparency
underwood
gasped
at
the
boundary
lines
of
the
facets
heavy
ribs
showed
the
tremendously
reinforced
structure
that
formed
the
skeleton
and
each
cell
between
the
ribs
was
filled
with
thick
substance
that
partially
revealed
the
unknown
world
within
but
more
than
that
between
one
set
of
ribs
he
glimpsed
what
he
was
sure
was
an
emptiness
a
doorway
to
the
interior
come
on
he
called
to
terry
look
at
that
opening
they
leaped
astride
the
scooters
clamped
to
the
surface
of
the
lab
ship
and
sped
into
space
between
the
two
objects
it
required
only
an
instant
to
confirm
his
first
hasty
glimpse
they
navigated
the
scooters
close
to
the
opening
and
clamped
them
to
the
surface
for
a
moment
underwood
thought
the
gem
might
be
some
strange
ship
from
far
out
of
the
universe
for
it
seemed
filled
with
mechanism
of
undescribable
characteristics
and
unknown
purposes
it
was
so
filled
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
very
far
into
the
interior
even
with
the
help
of
the
powerful
lamps
on
the
scooters
the
beam
was
the
key
to
get
into
the
thing
said
terry
it
was
intended
all
along
that
the
beam
be
turned
on
it
the
beam
had
to
be
connected
with
the
gem
in
some
way
and
what
a
way
the
triangular
opening
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
underwood
and
terry
knelt
at
the
edge
of
it
peering
down
flashing
their
lights
about
the
revealed
interior
the
opening
seemed
to
drop
into
the
center
of
a
small
room
that
was
bare
come
into
my
parlor
said
the
spider
to
the
fly
quoted
terry
i
do
see
anything
down
there
do
you
no
why
the
spider
recitation
i
do
know
everything
is
too
pat
i
feel
as
if
someone
is
watching
behind
us
practically
breathing
down
our
necks
and
urging
us
on
the
way
he
wants
us
to
go
and
when
we
get
there
we
are
going
to
like
it
i
suppose
that
is
strictly
a
scientific
hunch
which
we
ignorant
physicists
would
understand
but
terry
was
serious
the
whole
aspect
of
the
stroid
device
was
unnerving
in
the
way
it
led
along
from
step
to
step
as
if
unseen
powers
were
guiding
them
rather
than
using
their
own
initiative
in
their
work
underwood
gave
a
final
grunt
and
dropped
into
the
hole
flashing
his
light
rapidly
about
terry
followed
immediately
they
found
themselves
in
the
center
of
a
circular
room
twenty
feet
in
diameter
the
walls
and
the
floor
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
material
that
had
composed
the
outer
shell
of
the
gem
before
its
transmutation
the
walls
were
literally
covered
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
with
inscriptions
that
glowed
faintly
in
the
darkness
when
the
flashlights
were
not
turned
on
them
recognize
any
of
this
stuff
asked
underwood
stroid
iii
said
terry
in
awe
the
most
beautiful
collection
of
engravings
that
have
ever
been
found
we
never
obtained
a
consecutive
piece
even
a
fraction
this
size
before
dreyer
has
got
to
come
now
i
got
a
hunch
about
this
said
underwood
slowly
i
do
know
a
thing
about
the
procedures
used
in
deciphering
an
unknown
lingo
but
i
bet
you
find
that
this
is
an
instruction
primer
to
their
language
just
as
the
inscriptions
outside
gave
the
key
to
their
math
before
detailing
the
wave
equations
you
might
be
right
terry
eyes
glowed
with
enthusiasm
as
he
looked
about
the
polished
walls
with
the
faintly
glowing
characters
inlaid
in
them
if
that
the
case
papa
phyfe
and
i
ought
to
be
able
to
do
the
job
without
dreyer
they
returned
to
the
ship
for
photographic
equipment
and
to
report
their
finding
to
phyfe
it
was
a
little
difficult
for
him
to
adjust
to
the
view
that
something
had
been
gained
in
the
transformation
of
the
gem
the
sight
of
that
boiling
amorphous
mass
in
space
had
been
to
him
like
helplessly
standing
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
and
watching
a
loved
one
drown
but
with
terry
report
on
the
characters
in
stroid
iii
which
lined
the
walls
of
the
antechamber
which
they
had
penetrated
he
was
ready
to
admit
that
their
position
had
improved
underwood
was
merely
a
as
they
returned
to
the
gem
two
photographers
carson
and
enright
accompanied
them
along
with
nichols
assistant
semanticist
underwood
stood
by
in
the
depths
of
speculation
as
the
photographers
set
up
their
equipment
and
phyfe
bent
down
to
examine
the
characters
at
close
range
terry
continued
to
be
dogged
by
the
feeling
that
they
were
being
led
by
the
nose
into
something
that
would
end
unpleasantly
he
did
know
why
except
that
the
fact
of
immense
and
meticulous
preparation
was
evidenced
on
all
sides
it
was
the
reason
for
that
preparation
which
made
him
wonder
phyfe
said
to
underwood
doctor
bernard
tells
me
your
opinion
is
that
this
room
is
a
key
to
stroid
iii
you
may
be
right
but
i
fail
to
find
any
indication
of
it
at
present
what
gives
you
that
idea
the
whole
setup
said
underwood
first
there
was
the
impenetrable
shell
nothing
like
it
exists
in
solarian
culture
today
then
there
was
the
means
by
which
we
were
able
to
read
the
inscriptions
on
the
outside
obviously
if
heat
and
fission
reactions
as
well
as
chemical
reactions
could
not
touch
the
stuff
the
only
remaining
means
of
analysis
was
radiative
and
the
only
peoples
who
could
discover
the
inscriptions
were
those
capable
of
building
a
generator
of
radiations
we
have
there
two
highly
technical
requirements
of
anyone
attempting
to
solve
the
secret
of
this
cache
ability
to
generate
the
proper
radiation
and
the
ability
to
understand
their
mathematics
and
build
a
second
generator
from
their
wave
equations
now
that
we
in
here
there
is
nothing
more
we
can
do
until
we
can
understand
their
printed
language
obviously
they
must
teach
it
to
us
this
would
be
the
place
you
may
be
right
said
phyfe
but
we
archeologists
work
with
facts
not
guesses
we
know
soon
enough
if
it
true
underwood
felt
content
to
speculate
while
the
others
worked
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
no
way
out
of
the
anteroom
was
apparent
but
he
was
confident
that
a
way
to
the
interior
would
be
found
when
the
inscriptions
were
deciphered
he
went
out
to
the
surface
and
walked
slowly
about
peering
into
the
transparent
depths
with
his
light
what
lay
within
this
repository
left
by
an
ancient
race
that
had
obviously
equaled
or
surpassed
man
in
scientific
attainments
would
it
be
some
vast
store
of
knowledge
that
would
come
to
bless
mankind
with
greater
abundance
or
would
it
rather
be
a
new
pandora
box
which
would
pour
out
upon
the
world
new
ills
to
add
to
its
already
staggering
burden
the
world
had
about
all
it
could
stand
now
underwood
reflected
for
a
century
earth
scientific
production
had
boomed
her
factories
had
roared
with
the
throb
of
incessant
production
and
the
utopia
of
all
the
planners
of
history
was
gradually
coming
to
pass
man
capacities
for
production
had
steadily
increased
for
five
hundred
years
and
at
last
the
capacities
for
consumption
were
rising
equally
with
correspondingly
less
time
spent
in
production
and
greater
time
spent
in
consumption
but
the
utopia
was
coming
off
just
as
the
utopians
had
dreamed
of
it
the
ever
present
curse
of
enforced
leisure
was
not
respecting
the
new
age
any
more
than
it
had
past
ages
men
were
literally
being
driven
crazy
with
their
of
luxury
only
a
year
before
the
howling
craze
had
swept
cities
and
nations
it
was
a
wave
of
hysteria
that
broke
out
in
epidemic
proportions
thousands
of
people
within
a
city
would
be
stricken
at
a
time
by
insensate
weeping
and
despair
one
member
of
a
household
would
be
afflicted
and
quickly
it
would
spread
from
that
man
to
the
family
and
from
that
family
it
would
race
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
streets
up
and
down
the
city
until
one
vast
cry
as
of
a
stricken
animal
would
assault
the
heavens
underwood
had
seen
only
one
instance
of
the
howling
craze
and
he
had
fled
from
it
as
if
pursued
it
was
impossible
to
describe
its
effects
upon
the
nervous
system
a
whole
city
in
the
throes
of
hysteria
life
was
cheap
as
were
the
other
luxuries
of
earth
murders
by
the
thousands
each
month
were
scarcely
noticed
and
the
possession
of
weapons
for
protection
had
become
a
mark
of
the
new
age
for
no
man
knew
when
his
neighbor
might
turn
upon
him
governments
rose
and
fell
swiftly
and
became
little
more
than
figureheads
to
carry
out
the
demands
of
peoples
cloyed
with
the
excesses
of
life
most
significant
of
all
however
was
the
inability
of
any
leader
to
hold
any
following
for
more
than
a
short
time
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
earth
there
were
but
a
few
hundred
thousand
scientists
who
were
able
to
keep
themselves
on
even
keel
and
most
of
these
were
now
fleeing
as
he
thought
of
these
things
underwood
pondered
what
the
opening
of
the
repository
of
a
people
who
sealed
up
their
secrets
half
a
million
years
ago
would
mean
to
mankind
this
must
be
what
terry
felt
he
thought
for
perhaps
three
hours
he
remained
on
the
outside
of
the
shell
letting
his
mind
idle
under
the
brilliance
of
the
stars
suddenly
the
phones
in
his
helmet
came
alive
with
sound
it
was
the
voice
of
terry
bernard
we
got
it
del
he
said
quietly
we
can
read
this
stuff
like
nursery
rhymes
come
on
down
it
tells
us
how
to
get
into
the
thing
underwood
did
not
hurry
he
rose
slowly
from
his
sitting
position
and
stared
upward
at
the
stars
the
same
stars
that
had
looked
down
upon
the
beings
who
had
sealed
up
the
repository
this
is
it
he
thought
man
can
never
go
back
again
he
lowered
himself
into
the
opening
doctor
phyfe
was
strangely
quiet
in
spite
of
their
quick
success
in
deciphering
the
language
of
the
stroids
underwood
wondered
what
was
going
through
the
old
man
mind
did
he
too
sense
the
magnitude
of
this
moment
phyfe
said
they
were
semanticists
as
well
they
knew
frequency
it
right
here
the
key
they
used
to
reveal
their
language
no
one
less
advanced
in
semantics
than
our
own
civilization
could
have
deciphered
it
but
with
a
knowledge
of
carnovan
frequency
it
is
simple
practically
us
for
the
job
said
terry
phyfe
sharp
eyes
turned
upon
him
suddenly
behind
the
double
protection
of
his
spectacles
and
the
transparent
helmet
of
the
spacesuit
perhaps
said
phyfe
perhaps
we
are
at
any
rate
there
are
certain
manipulations
to
be
performed
which
will
open
this
chamber
and
provide
passage
to
the
interior
where
the
door
said
underwood
following
the
notes
he
had
made
terry
moved
about
the
room
directing
underwood
attention
to
features
of
the
design
delicately
carved
movable
levers
formed
an
intricate
combination
that
suddenly
released
a
section
of
the
floor
in
the
exact
center
of
the
room
it
depressed
slowly
then
revolved
out
of
the
way
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
while
phyfe
moved
to
the
opening
and
peered
down
a
stairway
of
the
same
glistening
material
as
the
walls
about
them
led
downward
into
the
depths
of
the
repository
phyfe
stepped
down
and
almost
stumbled
into
the
opening
watch
for
those
steps
he
warned
they
larger
than
necessary
for
human
beings
in
those
came
to
underwood
mind
he
tried
to
vision
the
creatures
who
had
walked
upon
this
stairway
and
touched
the
hand
rail
that
was
shoulder
high
for
him
the
repository
was
divided
into
levels
and
the
stairway
ended
abruptly
as
they
came
to
the
level
below
the
anteroom
the
chamber
in
which
they
found
themselves
was
crowded
with
artifacts
of
strange
shapes
and
varying
sizes
not
a
thing
of
familiar
cast
greeted
them
but
opposite
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
was
a
pedestal
and
upon
it
rested
a
booklike
object
that
proved
to
be
hinged
metallic
sheets
covered
with
stroid
iii
inscriptions
when
terry
climbed
up
to
examine
it
he
was
unable
to
move
it
but
the
metal
pages
were
locked
with
a
simple
clasp
that
responded
to
his
touch
it
looks
as
if
we
got
to
read
our
way
along
said
terry
i
suppose
this
will
tell
us
how
to
get
into
the
next
room
underwood
and
the
other
expedition
members
moved
cautiously
about
examining
the
contents
of
the
room
the
two
photographers
began
to
make
an
orderly
pictorial
record
of
everything
within
the
chamber
standing
alone
in
one
corner
underwood
peered
at
an
object
that
appeared
to
be
nothing
but
a
series
of
opaque
polychrome
globes
tangent
to
each
other
and
mounted
on
a
pedestal
whether
it
were
some
kind
of
machine
or
monument
he
could
not
tell
you
feel
it
too
said
a
sudden
quiet
voice
behind
him
underwood
whirled
about
in
surprise
phyfe
was
there
behind
him
his
slight
figure
a
shapeless
shadow
in
the
spacesuit
feel
what
i
watched
you
doctor
underwood
you
are
a
physicist
and
in
far
closer
touch
with
the
real
world
than
i
you
have
seen
me
i
can
not
even
manage
an
expedition
with
efficiency
my
mind
lives
constantly
in
the
past
and
i
can
not
comprehend
the
significance
of
contemporary
things
tell
me
what
it
will
mean
this
intrusion
of
an
alien
science
into
our
own
a
sudden
new
and
humbling
respect
filled
underwood
he
had
never
dreamed
that
the
little
archeologist
had
such
a
penetrating
view
of
himself
in
his
relation
to
his
environment
i
wish
i
could
answer
that
question
said
underwood
shaking
his
head
i
ca
perhaps
if
we
knew
we
destroy
the
thing
or
it
might
be
that
we
shout
our
discovery
to
the
universe
but
we
ca
know
and
we
would
dare
be
the
judges
if
we
could
whatever
it
is
the
ancient
stroids
seem
to
have
deliberately
attempted
to
provide
for
the
survival
of
their
culture
he
hesitated
that
of
course
is
my
guess
in
the
darkened
corner
of
the
chamber
phyfe
nodded
slowly
you
are
right
of
course
it
is
the
only
answer
we
dare
not
try
to
be
the
judges
underwood
saw
that
he
would
get
nowhere
in
his
understanding
of
the
stroid
science
by
merely
depending
on
the
translations
given
him
by
terry
and
phyfe
he
have
to
learn
to
read
the
stroid
inscriptions
himself
he
buttonholed
nichols
and
got
the
semanticist
to
show
him
the
rudiments
of
the
language
it
was
amazingly
simple
in
principle
and
constructed
along
semantic
lines
the
going
became
rapidly
heavier
however
and
it
took
them
the
equivalent
of
five
days
to
get
through
the
fairly
elementary
material
disclosed
in
the
first
level
below
the
antechamber
the
book
of
metal
pages
did
little
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
concerning
either
the
ancient
planet
or
its
culture
it
instructed
them
further
in
understanding
the
language
and
addressed
them
as
unknown
friends
the
nearest
human
translation
as
was
already
apparent
the
repository
had
been
prepared
to
save
the
highest
products
of
the
ancient
stroid
culture
from
the
destruction
that
came
upon
the
world
but
the
records
did
not
even
hint
as
to
the
nature
of
that
destruction
and
they
said
nothing
about
the
objects
in
the
room
the
scientists
were
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
little
revealed
to
them
so
far
but
as
expected
there
were
instructions
to
enter
the
next
lower
level
there
an
entirely
different
situation
confronted
them
the
chamber
into
which
they
came
after
winding
down
a
long
spiral
stairway
narrow
yet
with
the
same
high
steps
as
before
was
spherical
in
shape
and
seemed
to
be
concentric
with
the
outer
shell
of
the
repository
it
contained
a
single
object
the
object
was
a
cube
in
the
center
of
the
chamber
about
two
feet
on
a
side
from
the
corners
of
the
cube
long
supports
of
complicated
spring
structure
led
to
the
inner
surface
of
the
spherical
chamber
it
appeared
to
be
a
highly
effective
shock
mounting
for
whatever
was
contained
within
the
cube
the
sight
before
the
men
was
impressive
in
simplicity
yet
was
anticlimactic
for
there
was
nothing
here
of
the
great
wonders
that
they
had
expected
there
was
only
the
suspended
cube
and
a
book
quickly
phyfe
advanced
along
the
narrow
catwalk
that
led
from
the
opening
to
the
cube
the
book
lay
on
a
shelf
fastened
to
the
side
of
the
cube
phyfe
opened
it
to
the
first
sheet
and
read
haltingly
and
laboriously
greetings
unknown
friends
greetings
to
you
from
the
great
one
by
the
token
that
you
are
now
reading
this
you
have
proven
yourselves
mentally
capable
of
understanding
the
new
world
of
knowledge
and
discovery
that
may
be
yours
i
am
demarzule
the
great
one
the
greatest
of
great
sirenia
and
the
last
and
within
the
storehouse
of
my
mind
is
the
vast
knowledge
that
made
sirenia
the
greatest
world
in
all
the
universe
great
as
it
was
however
destruction
came
to
the
world
of
sirenia
but
her
knowledge
and
her
wonders
shall
never
pass
in
ages
after
new
worlds
will
rise
and
beings
will
inhabit
them
and
they
will
come
to
a
minimum
plane
of
knowledge
that
will
assure
their
appreciation
of
the
wonders
that
may
be
theirs
from
the
world
of
sirenia
you
have
minimum
technical
knowledge
else
you
could
not
have
created
the
radiation
necessary
to
render
the
storehouse
penetrable
you
have
a
minimum
semantic
knowledge
else
you
could
not
have
understood
my
words
that
have
brought
you
this
far
you
are
fit
and
capable
to
behold
the
great
one
of
sirenia
as
phyfe
turned
over
the
first
metal
sheet
the
men
looked
at
each
other
it
was
nichols
the
semanticist
who
said
there
are
only
two
possibilities
in
a
mind
that
would
write
a
statement
of
that
kind
either
it
belonged
to
a
truly
superior
being
or
to
a
maniac
so
far
in
man
history
there
has
not
been
encountered
such
a
superior
being
if
he
existed
it
would
have
been
wonderful
to
have
known
him
phyfe
paused
and
peered
with
difficulty
through
the
helmet
of
the
spacesuit
he
continued
i
live
i
am
eternal
i
am
in
your
midst
unknown
friends
and
to
your
hands
falls
the
task
of
bringing
speech
to
my
voice
and
sight
to
my
eyes
and
feeling
to
my
hands
then
when
you
have
fulfilled
your
mighty
task
you
shall
behold
me
and
the
greatness
of
the
great
one
of
sirenia
enright
the
photographer
said
what
the
devil
does
that
mean
the
guy
must
have
been
nuts
he
sounds
like
he
expected
to
come
back
to
life
the
feeling
within
underwood
was
more
than
bearable
it
was
composed
of
surging
anticipation
and
quiet
fearfulness
and
they
mingled
in
a
raging
torrent
the
men
made
no
sound
as
phyfe
read
on
i
shall
live
again
the
great
one
shall
return
and
you
who
are
my
unknown
friends
shall
assist
me
to
return
to
life
then
and
only
then
shall
you
know
the
great
secrets
of
the
world
of
sirenia
which
are
a
thousand
times
greater
than
your
own
only
then
shall
you
become
mighty
with
the
secrets
of
sirenia
locked
in
my
brain
by
the
powers
i
shall
reveal
you
shall
become
mighty
until
there
are
none
greater
in
all
the
universe
phyfe
turned
the
page
abruptly
he
stopped
he
turned
to
underwood
the
rest
of
it
is
yours
he
said
what
underwood
glanced
at
the
page
of
inscription
with
difficulty
he
took
up
the
reading
silently
the
substance
of
the
writings
had
changed
and
here
was
a
sudden
wilderness
of
an
alien
science
slowly
he
plodded
through
the
first
concepts
then
skimmed
as
it
became
evident
that
here
was
material
for
days
of
study
but
out
of
his
hasty
scanning
there
came
a
vision
of
a
great
dream
a
dream
of
conquest
of
the
eons
the
preservation
of
life
while
worlds
waned
and
died
and
flared
anew
it
told
of
an
unknown
radiation
turned
upon
living
cells
reducing
them
to
primeval
protoplasm
arresting
all
but
the
of
metabolism
and
it
spoke
of
other
radiation
and
complex
chemical
treatment
a
fantastic
process
that
could
restore
again
the
life
that
had
been
only
by
the
dormant
protoplasm
underwood
looked
up
his
eyes
went
from
the
featureless
cube
to
the
faces
of
his
companions
it
alive
he
breathed
five
hundred
million
years
and
it
alive
these
are
instructions
by
which
it
may
be
restored
none
of
the
others
spoke
but
underwood
eyes
were
as
if
a
sudden
great
commission
had
been
placed
upon
him
out
of
the
turmoil
of
his
thoughts
a
single
purpose
emerged
clear
and
irrevocable
within
that
cube
lay
dormant
matter
that
could
be
formed
into
a
brain
an
alien
but
mighty
brain
suddenly
underwood
felt
an
irrational
kinship
with
the
ancient
creature
who
had
so
conquered
time
and
in
his
own
mind
he
silently
vowed
that
if
it
lay
within
his
power
that
creature
would
live
again
and
speak
its
ancient
secrets
del
the
shock
of
surprise
and
the
flush
of
pleasure
heightened
the
beauty
of
illia
delicate
features
she
stood
in
the
doorway
the
aureole
of
her
pale
golden
hair
backlighted
by
the
illumination
from
within
the
room
surprised
said
underwood
he
always
found
it
difficult
to
speak
for
a
moment
after
the
first
sight
of
illia
no
one
would
guess
a
beauty
like
her
to
be
the
top
surgeon
of
medical
center
why
did
you
let
me
know
you
were
coming
it
not
fair
not
to
give
you
time
to
build
up
your
defenses
she
nodded
silently
as
he
took
her
into
his
arms
but
quickly
she
broke
away
and
led
him
to
the
seat
by
the
broad
windows
overlooking
the
night
lights
of
the
city
below
have
you
come
back
she
said
back
you
put
such
a
confusing
amount
of
meaning
into
ordinary
words
illia
she
smiled
and
sat
down
beside
him
and
swiftly
changed
the
subject
tell
me
about
the
expedition
archeology
has
always
seemed
the
most
futile
of
all
sciences
but
i
supposed
that
was
because
i
could
find
nothing
in
common
between
it
and
my
medical
science
nothing
in
common
with
the
future
i
wondered
what
a
physicist
could
find
in
it
i
think
you
find
something
in
common
with
our
latest
discovery
we
have
a
living
though
dormant
creature
on
an
equal
or
superior
plane
of
intelligence
with
us
its
age
is
around
half
a
million
years
you
will
be
interested
in
the
medical
aspects
of
that
i
am
sure
for
a
moment
illia
sat
as
if
she
had
heard
him
then
she
said
that
could
be
a
discovery
to
change
a
world
if
you
sure
of
what
found
underwood
felt
irritation
more
because
he
had
been
trying
to
fight
down
the
same
idea
himself
than
because
she
had
spoken
it
your
semantic
extensions
would
turn
phyfe
whiskers
white
we
have
found
any
such
discovery
we
found
a
creature
out
of
another
age
and
another
culture
but
it
not
going
to
disrupt
or
change
our
society
if
it
a
scientifically
superior
culture
how
do
you
know
what
it
will
do
we
do
but
to
apply
so
many
extensions
only
confuses
our
interpretation
more
i
mention
it
because
we
are
going
to
need
a
biological
advisor
i
thought
you
might
like
to
be
it
her
eyes
were
staring
far
out
across
the
halo
of
the
city
lights
she
said
del
is
it
human
human
what
human
is
intelligence
human
can
any
other
factor
of
our
existence
be
defined
as
human
if
you
can
tell
me
that
perhaps
i
can
answer
so
far
we
only
know
that
it
is
a
sentient
creature
of
high
scientific
culture
then
that
alone
makes
its
relationship
with
us
a
sympathetic
one
why
i
suppose
so
i
see
no
reason
why
not
yes
yes
i
agree
with
you
and
do
you
see
it
can
be
a
germ
of
rejuvenation
a
nucleus
to
gather
the
scattered
impulses
of
our
culture
and
unify
them
in
an
absorption
of
this
new
science
look
what
biological
knowledge
the
mere
evidence
of
suspended
animation
indicates
all
right
underwood
laughed
faintly
in
resignation
there
no
use
trying
to
avoid
such
a
discussion
with
you
is
there
illia
you
take
the
first
flower
of
spring
and
project
a
whole
summer
glory
from
it
would
you
but
am
i
wrong
in
this
the
people
of
earth
need
to
cement
them
together
in
this
period
of
disillusionment
this
could
be
it
i
know
said
underwood
we
talked
it
over
out
there
before
we
decided
to
go
ahead
with
the
restoration
we
talked
and
argued
for
hours
some
of
the
men
wanted
to
destroy
the
thing
immediately
because
it
is
impossible
to
forecast
the
effect
of
this
discovery
from
a
strictly
semantic
standpoint
we
have
no
data
terry
bernard
definitely
fought
for
its
destruction
phyfe
is
afraid
of
the
possible
consequences
but
he
maintains
that
we
have
the
right
to
destroy
it
because
it
is
too
great
a
heritage
i
maintain
that
from
a
purely
scientific
standpoint
we
have
no
right
to
consider
anything
but
restoration
regardless
of
consequences
and
there
is
something
more
the
personal
element
a
creature
whose
imagination
and
daring
were
great
enough
to
preserve
his
ego
through
an
age
of
five
hundred
thousand
years
deserves
something
more
than
summary
execution
he
deserves
the
right
to
be
known
and
heard
actually
it
seems
ridiculous
to
fear
anything
that
can
come
of
this
well
phyfe
and
terry
are
expert
semanticists
and
they
afraid
oh
they
wrong
del
they
be
wrong
if
they
have
no
data
if
they
have
only
a
hunch
a
prejudice
it
ridiculous
for
them
as
scientists
to
be
swayed
by
such
feelings
i
do
know
i
wash
my
hands
of
all
such
aspects
of
the
problem
i
only
know
that
i
going
to
see
that
a
guy
who
got
the
brains
and
guts
this
one
must
have
had
has
his
chance
to
be
heard
so
far
i
on
the
winning
side
tomorrow
i
going
to
see
boarder
and
the
director
committee
with
phyfe
if
you
interested
in
taking
the
job
i
mentioned
come
along
the
enthusiasm
of
the
directors
was
even
greater
than
that
of
illia
if
possible
none
of
them
seemed
to
share
the
fears
of
some
of
the
expedition
members
and
somehow
in
the
warm
familiarity
of
the
committee
room
those
fears
seemed
fantastically
groundless
boarder
the
elder
member
of
the
committee
of
directors
could
not
hold
back
his
tears
as
he
finished
the
report
and
underwood
had
given
verbal
amplification
what
a
wonderful
thing
that
this
should
have
happened
in
our
lifetime
he
said
do
you
think
it
is
feasible
the
thing
seems
so
so
fantastic
the
restoration
of
a
living
creature
of
half
a
million
years
ago
i
sure
i
do
know
the
answer
to
that
said
underwood
no
one
does
the
construction
of
the
equipment
described
by
the
stroid
though
is
completely
within
range
of
our
technical
knowledge
certain
that
we
can
set
it
up
exactly
according
to
specifications
it
is
possible
that
too
much
time
has
passed
and
the
protoplasm
has
died
it
is
possible
that
demarzule
thought
in
terms
of
hundreds
of
years
or
at
the
most
a
few
thousand
before
he
would
be
found
there
is
no
way
to
know
except
to
construct
the
equipment
and
carry
out
the
experiment
which
i
will
do
if
the
directors
wish
to
authorize
the
expenditure
there
is
no
question
of
that
said
boarder
we
mortgage
the
entire
institution
if
necessary
i
wondering
what
laboratory
space
we
can
use
why
not
put
it
in
the
new
carlson
museum
building
the
specimens
for
the
carlson
can
stay
in
the
warehouse
for
a
while
longer
boarder
looked
about
the
circle
of
directors
facing
him
he
saw
nods
and
called
for
a
vote
his
proposal
was
upheld
with
approval
given
phyfe
returned
to
the
expedition
to
supervise
the
transfer
of
the
repository
of
demarzule
to
earth
while
underwood
began
infinitely
detailed
planning
for
the
construction
and
setup
of
equipment
as
specified
by
the
instructions
he
had
brought
from
the
stroid
repository
the
great
semanticist
dreyer
was
asked
to
help
in
a
consulting
capacity
for
the
whole
project
specifically
to
assist
in
retranslation
of
the
records
to
make
absolutely
certain
of
their
interpretation
of
the
scientific
instructions
dreyer
was
a
short
squat
man
who
had
never
been
caught
without
a
thick
black
cigar
from
which
billowed
endless
columns
of
pale
blue
smoke
his
face
was
round
and
he
gave
the
impression
of
having
achieved
the
impossible
goal
of
complete
serenity
in
a
world
that
swirled
with
unceasing
turmoil
he
listened
quietly
when
approached
and
when
phyfe
and
underwood
had
finished
their
stories
he
said
yes
i
shall
be
glad
to
help
this
is
a
thing
of
great
importance
but
underwood
was
forced
to
shed
his
mind
of
sociological
and
semantic
implications
of
the
job
they
were
doing
the
technical
work
involved
was
of
tremendous
complexity
and
magnitude
a
mountainous
quantity
of
complicated
equipment
had
to
be
designed
and
built
but
as
underwood
deciphered
the
instructions
of
the
stroids
and
had
it
verified
by
dreyer
he
could
find
no
short
cuts
nor
did
he
dare
attempt
any
the
carlson
museum
had
been
designed
along
the
lines
of
an
ancient
greek
temple
and
was
set
prominently
on
a
low
hill
apart
from
other
groups
of
buildings
of
the
smithson
its
glistening
marble
columns
made
a
landmark
for
miles
it
was
rather
symbolical
in
a
way
underwood
thought
that
such
an
imposing
edifice
should
be
appointed
for
the
resurrection
of
the
ancient
great
one
the
central
hall
of
the
museum
was
cleared
of
display
cases
which
had
already
been
set
up
electronic
and
biological
equipment
began
to
flow
in
as
underwood
sent
strange
fabrication
orders
to
scattered
shops
and
plants
throughout
the
country
when
it
was
announced
that
the
carlson
would
not
open
on
the
date
previously
set
the
worldwide
news
associations
were
interested
and
underwood
was
suddenly
besieged
by
reporters
he
briefly
outlined
their
discovery
it
would
make
some
good
science
supplement
yarns
underwood
supposed
and
by
the
time
the
reporters
got
through
with
the
stories
they
would
have
a
whole
race
of
monsters
out
of
space
being
restored
in
the
carlson
underwood
told
them
as
much
but
davis
of
the
science
press
shook
his
head
no
that
not
the
angle
archeology
always
makes
good
stories
but
this
is
the
first
time
archeology
has
ever
produced
any
live
specimens
we
build
the
creature
up
big
from
the
sympathetic
angle
what
did
you
say
the
inscriptions
called
him
the
great
one
underwood
nodded
that
it
the
mysterious
all
knowing
brain
that
has
lain
dormant
in
the
void
for
ages
waiting
for
the
touch
of
a
merciful
hand
to
restore
life
to
that
mighty
intellect
and
receive
in
payment
the
magnificent
store
of
knowledge
locked
within
it
that
the
angle
we
use
underwood
mentally
gagged
and
returned
to
his
work
slowly
the
equipment
took
shape
within
the
large
hall
the
center
of
construction
was
the
ceramic
bath
which
would
hold
the
mass
of
protoplasm
in
its
nutrient
solution
and
keep
it
in
controlled
temperatures
and
pressures
the
complex
observation
panel
was
being
assembled
beside
it
from
this
point
every
physiological
function
of
the
developing
mass
could
be
observed
as
it
progressed
scores
of
meters
would
give
electronic
readings
which
could
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
developing
functions
it
was
almost
like
watching
the
development
and
growth
of
a
foetus
for
that
appeared
almost
to
be
the
course
of
growth
that
was
to
be
expected
automatic
valves
would
control
the
injection
into
the
bath
of
nutrient
materials
with
an
accuracy
of
a
thousandth
of
a
milligram
a
dozen
operators
would
be
trained
were
now
being
selected
for
the
precise
task
of
watching
the
bath
during
every
second
of
the
growth
of
the
organism
the
upper
half
of
the
walls
of
the
bath
was
transparent
as
was
the
cover
inside
under
the
cover
the
broad
reflecting
cone
of
the
radiator
would
spray
the
long
dormant
protoplasm
with
radiation
giant
generators
required
to
provide
this
radiation
filled
other
parts
of
the
hall
it
was
five
months
after
the
actual
discovery
of
the
repository
that
the
restoration
equipment
was
completed
and
tested
and
ready
for
use
public
interest
in
the
project
had
been
aroused
by
the
sensational
news
reports
and
a
constant
stream
of
people
passed
the
carlson
to
glimpse
the
activities
going
on
inside
the
news
stories
built
up
the
stroid
as
the
magnificent
benefactor
of
mankind
as
davis
had
promised
they
presented
a
sympathetic
aspect
of
a
creature
imprisoned
and
doomed
throughout
the
ages
and
now
being
released
from
bondage
and
ready
to
pour
out
blessings
upon
his
benefactors
underwood
did
pay
much
attention
to
the
news
stories
but
the
increasing
swarms
of
people
began
to
get
in
his
way
and
hampered
operations
he
was
forced
to
ask
the
directors
to
fence
off
a
large
area
about
the
carlson
during
this
time
the
had
been
slowly
swinging
in
an
orbit
about
the
earth
to
keep
the
repository
taken
bodily
into
its
hold
at
the
temperature
of
space
until
time
for
the
transfer
of
the
protoplasm
to
the
nutrient
bath
now
with
everything
completed
at
the
museum
underwood
and
phyfe
returned
to
the
repository
to
direct
the
removal
of
the
container
of
protoplasm
leaving
terry
bernard
in
charge
at
the
museum
the
operators
and
technicians
were
ready
to
take
over
their
duties
removal
of
the
protoplasm
to
earth
was
a
critical
operation
the
bath
at
the
carlson
had
been
brought
down
to
absolute
zero
and
would
be
brought
up
a
few
degrees
at
a
time
boarder
and
the
other
directors
of
the
institution
did
not
share
underwood
reluctance
for
publicity
they
were
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
the
publicity
writers
for
much
of
the
income
of
the
institute
depended
upon
such
publicity
which
drew
substantial
contributions
so
it
was
that
the
arrival
of
the
was
widely
announced
a
crowd
of
ten
thousand
gathered
to
watch
the
removal
of
the
protoplasm
that
had
once
been
a
great
and
alien
being
underwood
stood
in
the
control
room
watching
the
landing
area
beside
the
carlson
as
the
ship
settled
deep
into
earth
atmosphere
gradually
he
made
out
the
identity
of
the
black
smear
covering
the
landscape
about
the
white
stone
building
that
gleamed
like
a
grecian
temple
terry
beside
him
exclaimed
look
at
that
mob
the
whole
town
must
be
out
to
welcome
our
guest
if
they
do
get
out
of
the
landing
area
they
be
smeared
over
the
landscape
collins
contact
the
base
and
get
that
field
cleared
the
communications
officer
put
the
call
in
the
laboratory
ship
circled
idly
while
the
mob
moved
slowly
back
to
permit
the
ship
to
touch
down
beside
the
building
underwood
raced
out
of
the
ship
and
into
the
building
his
technicians
were
standing
by
each
one
in
turn
reported
his
position
operating
properly
then
underwood
called
back
to
the
ship
and
ordered
the
portable
lock
released
at
once
the
massive
cargo
hold
was
thrown
open
and
the
lock
bearing
the
container
of
protoplasm
was
wheeled
out
the
crowd
caught
sight
of
it
as
it
rolled
swiftly
into
the
building
someone
in
the
far
ranks
sent
up
a
cry
hail
the
great
one
welcome
to
earth
the
shout
was
taken
up
by
hundreds
then
thousands
of
throats
until
a
sea
of
sound
washed
against
the
ears
of
those
within
the
building
underwood
paused
and
turned
to
look
out
as
the
sound
caught
him
a
faint
chill
went
through
him
the
fools
he
said
angrily
to
terry
they
drive
themselves
into
hysteria
if
they
keep
that
up
why
did
the
directors
keep
this
whole
business
quiet
they
ought
to
have
known
how
it
would
affect
a
mob
of
bystanders
from
a
distance
illia
and
dreyer
watched
silently
underwood
hurried
away
to
give
attention
to
the
cargo
the
lock
was
wheeled
close
to
the
bath
and
a
passage
was
opened
as
the
two
containers
were
brought
adjacent
on
sterile
slides
the
frozen
protoplasmic
mass
slid
forward
and
came
to
rest
at
last
within
the
machine
for
which
it
had
waited
half
a
million
years
there
was
utter
lack
of
response
to
that
final
placement
of
the
mass
yet
those
who
watched
knew
that
the
great
experiment
had
begun
in
six
months
they
would
find
out
if
they
were
successful
underwood
sent
the
carriage
back
to
the
ship
and
the
moved
to
the
institute
spaceport
then
boarder
entered
with
a
score
of
photographers
and
newsmen
in
his
wake
they
took
pictures
of
the
equipment
and
technicians
and
of
the
protoplasm
lying
inert
within
the
bath
in
which
the
nutrient
liquids
would
be
placed
after
a
temperature
of
a
hundred
degrees
had
been
reached
underwood
did
not
have
time
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
newsmen
he
tried
to
be
everywhere
at
once
inspecting
meters
and
gauges
assuring
himself
that
all
was
functioning
well
every
piece
of
equipment
was
triply
installed
for
safety
in
case
of
breakdown
the
instructions
warned
that
once
started
the
process
of
restoration
must
not
be
interrupted
or
death
to
the
great
one
would
result
when
he
had
finished
his
inspection
underwood
felt
suddenly
exhausted
he
turned
away
to
avoid
the
newsmen
whom
boarder
was
now
lecturing
on
the
subject
of
the
strange
repository
in
space
and
its
even
stranger
inhabitant
underwood
spied
the
aged
figure
standing
almost
unseen
near
the
recess
between
two
panels
it
was
phyfe
and
he
spoke
slowly
as
underwood
approached
it
is
begun
the
old
archeologist
said
slowly
and
it
can
never
be
undone
underwood
felt
again
that
chill
of
apprehension
and
looked
sharply
at
phyfe
but
the
latter
was
staring
straight
ahead
straight
at
the
inert
block
of
protoplasm
phyfe
asked
to
be
relieved
of
his
duties
as
head
of
the
expedition
still
in
the
field
in
order
that
he
might
devote
his
entire
time
to
a
study
of
stroid
records
and
manuscripts
now
in
existence
terry
bernard
gave
up
field
work
to
assist
him
in
order
to
be
near
the
site
of
restoration
with
them
was
dreyer
who
attacked
with
feverish
effort
the
translation
of
the
language
that
had
defied
him
so
long
underwood
was
concerned
with
the
resurrection
itself
he
sensed
that
the
very
secret
of
life
was
involved
in
the
work
he
was
doing
the
instruction
book
left
by
the
stroid
was
in
the
nature
of
an
operating
manual
however
rather
than
a
theoretical
text
and
now
that
the
experiment
was
actually
under
way
underwood
abandoned
everything
in
an
attempt
to
study
fully
the
processes
that
were
taking
place
so
occupied
were
they
with
their
own
studies
that
the
scientists
scarcely
noticed
the
public
reaction
to
the
creature
they
were
attempting
to
restore
the
first
outward
sign
had
been
that
wild
cry
of
welcome
the
day
the
protoplasm
was
brought
to
earth
the
next
was
the
sunday
sermon
preached
by
one
of
the
multitude
of
obscure
religious
leaders
in
a
poorly
attended
meeting
in
a
luxurious
church
in
that
same
city
william
hennessey
had
been
a
publicity
man
in
his
early
years
before
the
full
breakdown
began
to
show
and
he
was
conscious
of
good
publicity
values
but
perhaps
he
half
believed
what
he
wrote
and
the
mere
preaching
of
it
convinced
him
it
was
so
it
is
probable
that
there
were
other
preachers
who
took
the
same
theme
that
sunday
morning
but
william
hennessey
was
the
one
that
got
the
news
publicity
he
said
how
many
of
this
congregation
this
morning
are
among
those
who
have
given
up
in
the
race
of
life
who
have
despaired
of
values
and
standards
to
cling
to
who
have
forsaken
the
leadership
of
all
who
would
lead
you
perhaps
you
are
among
the
millions
of
those
who
have
given
up
all
hope
of
solving
the
great
problems
of
life
if
you
are
i
want
to
ask
if
you
were
among
those
who
witnessed
the
miraculous
arrival
of
the
gift
out
of
the
ages
were
you
among
those
who
saw
the
great
one
william
hennessey
paused
for
centuries
we
have
looked
for
leadership
in
our
own
midst
and
not
found
it
they
were
after
all
merely
human
but
now
into
the
hands
of
our
noble
scientists
has
been
imparted
the
great
task
of
awakening
the
sleeping
great
one
and
when
they
have
completed
their
work
the
golden
age
of
earth
will
be
upon
us
i
call
upon
you
to
throw
off
the
shackles
of
despair
come
out
of
the
prison
of
your
disillusionment
make
ready
to
greet
the
great
one
on
the
day
of
his
rising
let
your
hearts
and
minds
be
ready
to
receive
the
message
that
he
shall
give
and
to
obey
the
words
of
counsel
you
shall
surely
be
given
for
truly
from
a
greater
world
and
a
brighter
land
than
ours
has
come
the
great
one
to
preserve
us
within
an
hour
hennessey
words
were
flashed
around
the
world
terry
was
the
only
one
of
the
scientists
on
the
project
who
heard
about
it
he
went
over
to
the
museum
in
the
afternoon
and
found
underwood
and
dreyer
at
the
test
board
some
crackpot
preacher
this
morning
gave
out
a
sermon
on
oscar
here
he
jerked
a
thumb
toward
the
bath
he
says
we
got
the
solution
to
all
the
world
ills
he
calling
on
the
people
to
worship
oscar
you
might
know
some
fool
thing
like
that
would
happen
dreyer
emitted
a
single
explosive
puff
of
cigar
smoke
a
religious
cult
based
upon
this
alien
intelligence
we
should
have
predicted
that
development
i
wonder
why
our
computations
failed
to
indicate
it
i
think
it
dangerous
said
terry
it
could
turn
into
serious
business
what
do
you
mean
i
do
get
it
said
underwood
do
you
see
the
implications
the
whole
trouble
with
our
culture
is
disillusionment
lack
of
leadership
if
this
thing
turns
out
to
be
sentient
intelligent
even
superior
why
it
could
become
anything
the
people
wanted
to
make
it
president
dictator
god
or
what
not
oh
take
it
easy
underwood
said
this
is
just
one
little
preacher
who
probably
did
have
more
than
a
hundred
in
his
congregation
the
news
broadcasts
must
have
treated
it
as
a
humorous
commentary
on
our
experiments
just
the
same
we
should
never
have
allowed
the
news
to
be
broadcast
it
all
started
with
that
hysterical
mob
the
day
we
brought
the
protoplasm
here
dreyer
shook
his
head
amid
the
smoke
aura
no
it
began
long
ago
when
the
first
cave
man
plastered
up
his
clay
gods
and
found
them
cracked
in
the
sun
and
washed
away
with
the
rains
it
began
when
the
first
cave
chieftain
was
slain
by
a
rival
leader
and
his
disillusioned
followers
looked
about
for
a
new
head
man
it
has
been
going
on
ever
since
it
no
concern
of
ours
said
underwood
dreyer
went
on
slowly
as
one
by
one
the
gods
and
chieftains
fell
men
cast
about
for
new
leaders
who
would
bear
the
burdens
of
mankind
and
show
the
way
to
that
illusive
paradise
that
all
men
sought
through
the
ages
there
have
always
been
those
who
would
let
themselves
be
lifted
up
and
called
great
who
would
undertake
to
lead
some
had
their
eyes
on
faraway
starry
places
that
man
could
never
reach
and
their
disciples
fell
away
heartbroken
and
discouraged
others
sought
their
goal
by
mastery
over
foreign
men
and
nations
and
bathed
their
followers
in
blood
and
disaster
but
always
their
star
fell
and
men
never
found
the
elusive
goal
which
they
could
not
name
nor
define
and
so
the
age
of
disillusion
said
underwood
bitterly
but
disillusion
is
a
healthy
thing
it
leads
to
reality
how
can
you
call
this
healthy
underwood
demanded
men
believe
in
nothing
they
have
lost
faith
in
life
itself
faith
in
life
i
wonder
what
that
means
said
dreyer
musingly
watch
your
extensions
dr
underwood
underwood
flushed
recalling
illia
remark
that
dreyer
would
tear
off
every
other
word
and
throw
it
back
at
him
all
right
then
there
are
no
governments
no
leaders
no
religions
to
lean
upon
in
times
of
need
because
men
have
no
confidence
in
such
sources
all
of
which
is
a
sign
that
they
are
approaching
a
stage
in
which
they
will
no
longer
need
such
support
and
like
a
baby
in
his
first
steps
they
stumble
and
fall
they
get
bruised
and
cry
as
i
detect
that
many
of
our
scientists
have
done
else
they
would
not
have
run
away
to
venus
and
other
places
underwood
blinked
from
the
sting
of
dreyer
rebuke
that
the
second
time
i
been
accused
of
running
away
he
said
no
offense
dreyer
said
i
am
merely
stating
facts
that
you
do
not
believe
them
is
not
to
your
condemnation
only
a
commentary
on
the
state
of
your
knowledge
but
our
discussion
is
on
the
restoration
of
the
alien
and
your
knowledge
may
have
effects
in
the
disposition
of
this
project
policy
is
controlled
by
the
directors
who
will
be
guided
by
your
recommendations
dreyer
shook
his
head
no
i
think
not
unless
it
pleases
them
should
i
ever
recommend
destruction
of
the
alien
i
would
have
to
work
through
you
and
that
would
take
much
convincing
would
it
not
plenty
said
underwood
are
you
recommending
that
now
not
yet
no
not
yet
slowly
dreyer
moved
away
toward
the
massive
bath
that
housed
the
alien
demarzule
hetrarra
of
sirenia
the
great
one
underwood
watching
the
of
the
semanticist
felt
deflated
by
the
encounter
dreyer
seemed
always
so
calm
underwood
wondered
if
it
were
possible
to
acquire
such
immunity
to
turmoil
he
turned
back
to
terry
who
had
stood
in
silent
agreement
with
dreyer
how
are
you
and
phyfe
coming
along
it
a
slow
business
even
with
the
help
of
the
key
in
the
repository
that
was
apparently
pure
stroid
iii
but
we
have
two
other
languages
or
dialects
that
are
quite
different
and
we
seem
to
have
more
specimens
of
those
than
we
do
of
stroid
iii
phyfe
thinks
he
on
the
way
to
cracking
both
stroid
i
and
ii
though
personally
i
like
to
get
back
out
to
the
asteroids
if
it
were
for
demarzule
i
was
meant
to
be
a
scholar
stick
with
it
i
hoping
that
we
can
have
some
kind
of
idea
what
the
stroid
civilization
was
like
by
the
time
demarzule
revives
how
is
it
coming
cell
formation
is
taking
place
but
how
organs
will
ever
develop
is
more
than
i
can
see
we
just
waiting
and
observing
four
motion
picture
cameras
are
constantly
at
work
some
through
electron
microscopes
at
the
end
of
six
months
we
at
least
have
a
record
of
what
occurred
regardless
of
what
it
is
the
mass
of
life
grew
and
multiplied
its
millions
of
cells
meanwhile
another
growth
less
tangible
but
no
less
real
was
swiftly
rising
and
spreading
through
the
earth
the
mind
of
each
man
it
encompassed
was
one
of
its
cells
and
they
were
multiplying
no
less
rapidly
than
those
of
the
growth
within
the
marble
museum
building
the
leadership
of
men
by
men
had
proven
false
beyond
all
hope
of
ever
restoring
the
dream
of
a
mortal
man
who
could
raise
his
fellows
to
the
heights
of
the
stars
but
the
great
one
was
something
else
again
utterly
beyond
all
earthly
build
and
untainted
with
the
flaws
of
earthmen
he
was
the
gift
of
the
gods
to
man
he
a
god
who
would
lift
man
to
the
eternal
heights
of
which
he
had
dreamed
the
flame
spread
and
leaped
the
oceans
of
earth
it
swept
up
all
creeds
and
races
and
colors
delmar
underwood
looked
up
from
his
desk
in
annoyance
as
a
pompous
man
of
short
stout
build
was
ushered
in
by
his
secretary
the
man
halted
halfway
between
the
door
and
the
desk
and
bowed
slightly
he
said
i
address
the
prophet
underwood
by
special
commission
of
the
disciples
what
the
devil
underwood
frowned
and
extended
a
hand
toward
a
button
but
he
did
ring
the
visitor
extended
an
envelope
and
by
special
authorization
of
director
boarder
of
the
institute
still
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
man
underwood
accepted
the
envelope
and
ripped
it
open
in
formal
language
and
the
customary
red
tape
manner
it
instructed
underwood
to
hear
the
visitor
one
william
hennessey
and
grant
the
request
that
hennessey
would
make
underwood
knew
him
now
his
throat
felt
suddenly
dry
what
this
all
about
the
man
shrugged
disparagingly
i
am
only
a
poor
disciple
of
the
great
one
who
has
been
commissioned
by
his
fellows
to
seek
a
favor
at
the
hands
of
the
prophet
underwood
as
underwood
looked
into
the
man
eyes
he
felt
a
chill
and
a
wave
of
apprehension
swept
over
him
with
staggering
force
sit
down
he
said
what
is
it
you
want
he
wished
dreyer
were
here
to
place
some
semantic
evaluation
upon
this
crazy
incident
the
disciples
of
the
great
one
would
have
the
privilege
of
viewing
the
master
said
hennessey
as
he
sat
down
near
the
desk
you
scientists
are
instruments
selected
for
a
great
task
the
great
one
did
not
come
only
to
a
select
few
he
came
to
all
mankind
we
request
the
right
to
visit
the
temple
quietly
and
view
the
magnificent
work
you
are
doing
as
you
restore
our
master
to
life
so
that
we
may
receive
of
his
great
gifts
underwood
could
picture
the
laboratory
filled
with
bowing
praying
yelling
fanatic
worshippers
crowding
around
destroying
equipment
and
probably
trying
to
walk
off
with
bits
of
holy
protoplasm
he
pressed
a
switch
and
spun
a
dial
savagely
in
a
moment
the
face
of
director
boarder
was
on
the
tiny
screen
before
him
this
fanatic
hennessey
is
here
i
just
wanted
to
check
on
the
possible
liability
before
having
him
thrown
out
on
his
ear
boarder
face
grew
frantic
do
do
that
you
got
my
note
do
exactly
as
i
said
those
are
orders
but
we
ca
carry
on
an
experiment
with
a
bunch
of
fanatics
yapping
at
our
heels
i
do
care
how
you
do
it
you
got
to
give
them
what
they
want
either
that
or
fold
up
the
experiment
the
latest
poll
shows
they
effectively
control
eighty
million
votes
you
know
what
that
means
one
word
to
the
congressional
scientific
committee
and
all
of
us
would
be
out
on
our
ear
we
could
shut
the
thing
up
and
call
it
off
the
protoplasm
would
just
quietly
die
and
then
what
would
these
birds
have
to
worship
destruction
of
government
property
carry
the
death
penalty
said
boarder
ominously
besides
you
too
much
of
the
scientist
to
do
that
you
want
to
see
the
thing
through
just
as
much
as
the
rest
of
us
do
if
i
had
the
slightest
fear
that
you
destroy
it
i
yank
you
out
of
there
before
you
knew
where
you
were
but
i
have
any
such
fears
yes
you
right
but
these
underwood
made
a
grimace
as
if
he
were
trying
to
swallow
an
oyster
with
fur
on
i
know
we
got
to
put
up
with
it
the
scientist
who
survives
in
this
day
and
age
is
the
one
who
adjusts
to
his
environment
boarder
grinned
sourly
i
went
out
to
space
to
escape
the
environment
now
i
right
back
in
it
only
worse
than
ever
well
look
underwood
why
ca
you
just
build
a
sort
of
balcony
with
a
ramp
running
across
the
lab
so
that
these
disciples
of
the
great
one
can
look
down
into
the
bath
you
could
feed
them
in
at
one
end
of
the
building
and
run
them
out
the
other
that
way
it
would
upset
you
after
all
it
only
going
to
last
six
months
when
the
stroid
revives
they
probably
want
to
put
him
on
a
throne
with
a
radiant
halo
about
his
head
boarder
laughed
if
he
represents
the
civilization
whose
artifacts
we
found
on
the
asteroids
i
think
he
take
care
of
his
in
short
order
anyway
you
have
to
do
as
they
demand
it
wo
last
long
boarder
cut
off
and
underwood
turned
back
to
the
bland
hennessey
who
sat
as
if
nothing
would
ever
disturb
him
you
see
hennessey
said
i
knew
what
the
outcome
would
be
i
had
faith
in
the
great
one
faith
you
knew
that
the
scientific
committee
would
back
you
up
because
you
represent
eighty
million
neurotic
crackpots
what
will
you
do
when
your
great
one
wakes
up
and
tells
you
all
to
go
to
hell
hennessey
smiled
quietly
he
wo
i
have
faith
two
days
later
underwood
received
a
call
from
phyfe
asking
for
an
appointment
it
was
urgent
that
was
all
phyfe
would
tell
him
the
archeologist
had
not
heard
of
the
demands
of
the
disciples
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
construction
under
way
in
the
great
central
hall
where
the
restoration
equipment
was
installed
he
found
underwood
with
illia
in
the
laboratory
examining
films
of
the
protoplasmic
growth
what
are
you
building
out
there
he
asked
i
thought
you
had
all
the
equipment
in
a
monument
to
human
stupidity
underwood
growled
then
he
told
phyfe
of
the
orders
he
had
received
we
putting
in
a
balcony
so
that
the
faithful
can
look
down
upon
their
great
one
boarder
says
we
have
to
put
up
with
this
nonsense
for
six
months
why
six
months
demarzule
will
be
revived
by
then
or
else
we
have
failed
in
either
case
the
disciples
will
have
come
to
an
end
why
underwood
glanced
up
in
irritation
if
he
dead
they
wo
have
anything
to
worship
and
if
he
lives
he
certainly
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
them
i
could
ask
another
said
phyfe
but
i
put
it
this
way
you
know
nothing
of
how
he
will
act
if
he
lives
and
if
he
dies
probably
be
a
martyr
that
will
establish
a
new
worldwide
religion
with
those
of
us
who
have
had
to
do
with
this
experiment
and
its
failure
being
burned
at
the
stake
underwood
laid
down
the
sheaf
of
films
out
among
the
asteroids
he
had
learned
to
respect
the
old
archeologist
opinions
but
dreyer
had
already
laid
more
of
a
burden
upon
him
than
he
felt
he
should
bear
the
technological
aspects
of
this
problem
are
more
than
you
say
you
have
found
fortunately
for
us
certain
stroid
records
were
small
metallic
plates
whose
molecular
structure
was
altered
according
to
script
or
vocal
patterns
some
of
the
boys
in
the
lab
have
developed
a
device
for
listening
to
the
audio
records
we
have
actually
heard
the
of
the
stroids
at
least
there
are
sounds
that
resemble
a
spoken
language
but
it
is
what
we
have
found
on
the
written
records
that
brought
me
here
more
than
years
ago
the
most
fortunate
find
previous
to
the
discovery
of
the
repository
was
made
an
extensive
cache
of
historical
records
was
uncovered
by
dickens
one
of
the
early
workers
in
the
field
they
were
almost
fused
together
and
the
molecular
alteration
was
barely
traceable
due
to
exposure
to
terrific
heat
but
we
succeeded
in
separating
the
plates
and
transferring
their
records
in
amplified
form
to
new
sheets
and
we
can
read
them
we
have
a
remarkably
complete
section
of
stroid
history
just
before
their
extermination
and
if
we
are
reading
it
correctly
there
a
surprising
fact
about
them
what
is
that
they
were
not
native
to
this
solar
system
they
were
refugees
whose
home
world
had
been
destroyed
in
something
completely
revolting
in
an
intellect
that
would
foresee
the
doom
of
a
world
and
set
about
to
assure
its
own
preservation
but
that
is
only
your
own
subjective
extension
illia
answered
there
is
no
such
semantic
concept
in
the
idea
is
there
the
egotism
the
absolute
lack
of
concern
for
a
creature
fellows
those
are
semantically
contained
in
it
and
that
is
why
i
more
than
a
little
afraid
of
what
we
shall
find
if
we
do
succeed
in
reviving
this
creature
how
is
it
developing
it
seems
to
be
going
through
a
sort
of
conventional
embryonic
growth
illia
answered
it
already
passed
a
stage
so
far
it
has
generally
mammalian
characteristics
more
than
that
is
impossible
to
say
but
what
about
this
new
evidence
enough
for
my
mental
capacity
i
ca
and
wo
give
a
damn
about
any
other
aspects
you
must
phyfe
eyes
were
suddenly
afire
demanding
unyielding
we
have
new
evidence
terry
may
have
been
right
when
he
asked
to
have
the
protoplasm
destroyed
illia
froze
what
evidence
what
type
of
mentality
would
attempt
to
preserve
itself
through
a
planetary
catastrophe
that
destroyed
all
its
contemporaries
asked
phyfe
i
find
some
great
interstellar
conflict
and
whose
enemies
eventually
traced
them
and
destroyed
for
the
second
time
the
world
on
which
they
lived
out
of
all
that
ancient
people
destroyed
as
completely
as
was
carthage
only
this
single
individual
remained
do
you
see
the
significance
of
that
if
he
lives
he
will
live
again
with
the
same
hate
and
lust
for
revenge
that
filled
him
as
he
saw
his
own
world
fall
it
wo
survive
the
knowledge
that
all
that
he
fought
for
disappeared
geologic
ages
past
objected
underwood
besides
you
are
contradicting
yourself
if
he
was
so
unconcerned
about
his
own
world
perhaps
he
had
no
interest
in
the
conflict
maybe
he
was
the
supreme
genius
of
his
day
and
wanted
only
to
escape
from
a
useless
carnage
that
he
could
not
stop
no
there
is
no
contradiction
said
phyfe
earnestly
that
is
typical
of
the
war
leader
who
has
brought
his
people
to
destruction
at
the
moment
when
disaster
overwhelms
them
he
thinks
only
of
himself
the
specimen
we
have
here
is
a
supreme
example
of
what
such
egocentric
desires
for
lead
to
phyfe
abruptly
rose
from
the
chair
and
tossed
a
sheaf
of
papers
on
the
laboratory
bench
here
it
is
read
it
for
yourself
it
a
pretty
free
translation
of
the
story
we
found
on
dickens
records
he
left
abruptly
illia
and
underwood
turned
to
the
short
script
he
had
left
behind
and
began
reading
the
hundred
mighty
vessels
of
the
sirenian
empire
flung
themselves
across
space
that
was
made
tangible
by
their
velocity
the
impregnable
heart
of
the
fleet
was
deep
in
the
hull
of
the
flagship
where
the
sirenian
hetrarra
demarzule
slumped
sullenly
before
the
complex
panel
that
reported
all
the
workings
of
his
vast
fleet
beside
him
was
the
old
but
sinewy
figure
of
toshmere
the
genius
who
had
saved
this
remnant
of
the
once
mighty
empire
that
could
have
put
a
million
vessels
like
these
into
space
at
one
time
toshmere
said
further
flight
is
useless
our
instruments
show
that
the
dragbora
are
gaining
their
fleet
outnumbers
us
ten
to
one
even
with
my
protective
screens
we
ca
hope
to
resist
long
they
got
the
one
weapon
we
ca
withstand
they
determined
to
wipe
out
the
last
of
the
sirenian
empire
and
i
determined
to
wipe
out
the
last
of
the
dragbora
demarzule
snapped
in
sudden
fury
he
rose
out
of
the
chair
and
paced
the
room
i
shall
live
i
shall
live
to
see
their
world
blasted
to
energy
and
the
last
dragbor
dead
is
the
repository
nearly
ready
toshmere
nodded
and
you
are
certain
of
your
method
yes
would
you
care
to
see
our
final
results
demarzule
nodded
and
toshmere
led
the
way
through
the
door
and
down
the
long
corridor
to
the
laboratory
where
lay
demarzule
hopes
of
spanning
the
eons
and
escaping
the
enemy
who
had
sworn
no
quarter
the
sirenian
hetrarra
watched
impassively
as
the
scientist
put
a
small
animal
into
a
chamber
he
backed
away
behind
a
shield
and
pressed
a
switch
instantly
the
animal
was
bathed
in
a
flood
of
orange
glow
and
a
terrible
look
of
pain
crossed
the
animal
face
while
hideous
cries
came
from
its
throat
it
is
not
pleasant
observed
demarzule
no
said
toshmere
but
it
is
necessary
that
it
be
done
with
full
consciousness
of
mind
otherwise
proper
restoration
can
not
be
made
the
ruler
was
impassive
as
the
animal
cries
slowly
died
while
its
body
melted
under
the
glow
of
the
beam
literally
melted
until
it
flowed
into
a
pool
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
where
it
quivered
with
residual
life
forces
pure
protoplasm
explained
toshmere
it
can
be
frozen
to
absolute
zero
and
the
remaining
metabolism
will
be
undetectable
yet
life
will
remain
perhaps
for
a
thousand
long
enough
for
new
worlds
to
form
and
old
ones
die
long
enough
for
the
last
dragbor
to
die
while
i
demarzule
hetrarra
of
sirenia
live
on
in
glory
and
triumph
toshmere
smiled
a
thin
smile
that
demarzule
did
not
see
in
his
own
preoccupation
what
a
tragedy
for
the
civilizations
of
the
universe
if
demarzule
or
any
remnant
of
the
sirenian
empire
should
survive
toshmere
thought
the
dragbora
had
well
considered
their
plans
when
they
set
upon
a
program
of
complete
extermination
for
the
sirenians
his
own
life
would
be
far
more
worthy
of
salvation
from
the
impending
doom
than
that
of
demarzule
from
the
first
moment
that
he
had
conceived
the
repository
and
presented
the
idea
to
demarzule
toshmere
had
planned
that
it
would
hold
not
demarzule
but
toshmere
himself
there
was
only
one
way
to
go
ahead
with
such
a
gigantic
project
however
and
that
was
letting
demarzule
believe
that
it
would
be
for
him
since
it
could
not
be
prepared
in
secret
demarzule
would
have
to
assent
to
the
construction
he
would
do
that
if
he
thought
it
were
for
himself
the
idea
would
appeal
to
his
egotistical
mind
the
thought
of
his
own
personality
spanning
the
eons
while
all
the
civilization
he
knew
decayed
and
was
swept
away
would
delight
him
the
revival
said
demarzule
let
me
see
how
life
is
to
be
brought
back
toshmere
swung
another
projector
into
line
above
the
bowl
and
snapped
another
switch
invisible
rays
suddenly
bathed
the
mass
of
shapeless
protoplasm
within
the
bowl
as
they
watched
it
quivered
and
flowed
swiftly
changing
shapes
and
growth
and
life
took
possession
of
it
the
ruler
of
the
sirenians
watched
the
reformation
of
the
animal
in
the
bowl
limbs
and
torso
formed
in
shadowy
gray
outline
then
abruptly
solidified
and
the
animal
leaped
up
alive
and
startled
even
demarzule
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
seeming
miracle
it
is
swift
he
remarked
the
specimen
is
unharmed
completely
said
toshmere
the
process
is
not
so
rapid
after
a
long
period
of
time
has
elapsed
the
level
of
life
is
very
low
but
never
will
it
completely
disappear
the
lower
it
is
however
the
longer
it
takes
for
restoration
after
many
hundred
it
might
require
as
much
as
a
but
it
would
be
sure
to
succeed
regardless
toshmere
nodded
the
hundred
ships
of
the
sirenian
bore
on
their
steady
course
with
the
enemy
constantly
gaining
even
though
galaxies
away
at
last
the
lookout
spotted
a
likely
system
in
which
the
fifth
planet
showed
signs
of
habitability
demarzule
ordered
preparations
be
made
for
a
halt
the
planet
they
found
was
inhabited
by
the
remnants
of
a
dying
civilization
that
had
almost
to
its
infancy
the
opposition
offered
was
quickly
disposed
of
and
the
sirenian
refugees
began
the
frantic
and
hopeless
task
of
constructing
defenses
against
the
coming
of
the
overwhelming
force
of
the
dragbora
defenses
they
knew
were
as
penetrable
as
air
to
the
new
fearful
weapon
strength
of
the
enemy
but
while
gigantic
screen
generators
were
swiftly
reared
against
the
sky
and
beam
emplacements
were
dug
the
best
and
wisest
of
the
scientists
were
busy
preparing
the
repository
for
the
hetrarra
demarzule
the
huge
container
which
would
be
rendered
impervious
to
all
known
forces
except
the
key
frequency
whose
formula
was
inscribed
upon
the
outside
was
to
be
lowered
thousands
of
feet
into
the
great
ore
beds
of
the
planet
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
the
final
blast
that
would
shear
the
planet
two
men
would
go
into
that
repository
but
only
one
would
survive
the
eons
toshmere
was
the
only
one
completely
acquainted
with
the
entire
process
so
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
direct
the
operation
of
the
instruments
but
toshmere
knew
that
demarzule
had
no
intention
of
allowing
him
to
leave
the
repository
with
knowledge
of
its
secrets
any
more
than
toshmere
intended
that
demarzule
should
be
the
one
to
benefit
by
those
secrets
for
three
the
sirenians
worked
frantically
putting
up
their
mighty
defense
works
and
then
their
lookout
posted
a
hundred
thousand
light
years
out
in
space
announced
the
arrival
of
the
terrible
dragboran
fleet
just
before
a
tongue
of
light
from
that
fleet
lashed
out
at
him
and
swept
him
into
the
eternities
toshmere
approached
demarzule
in
his
headquarters
as
the
word
came
there
is
not
much
time
left
hetrarra
the
repository
is
ready
demarzule
looked
out
upon
the
sprawling
works
and
great
machines
so
pitifully
huddled
together
on
an
alien
planet
this
was
all
that
remained
of
the
vast
empire
which
he
had
dreamed
of
extending
to
the
limits
of
space
itself
the
empire
over
which
he
was
to
have
been
supreme
hetrarra
and
in
a
short
moment
this
remnant
would
be
wiped
out
under
the
devastating
supremacy
of
the
now
mightier
dragbora
he
looked
at
toshmere
hesitantly
in
the
face
of
certain
death
the
old
lean
sinewy
scientist
showed
nothing
but
calm
the
hetrarra
took
one
final
glance
at
the
remnants
of
his
sirenian
empire
and
nodded
i
am
ready
he
said
they
went
out
to
the
entrance
to
the
shaft
leading
toward
the
heart
of
the
planet
the
shaft
had
been
built
with
the
knowledge
of
only
a
few
sirenians
and
none
of
them
were
aware
of
its
purpose
thinking
rather
that
it
was
a
means
of
defense
nobody
saw
the
hetrarra
and
the
genius
toshmere
enter
the
elevator
that
carried
them
forever
into
the
depths
below
the
surface
of
the
planet
underwood
and
illia
came
to
the
end
of
the
page
and
underwood
swore
softly
as
he
thumbed
through
the
few
remaining
sheets
there
was
no
more
about
the
ancient
demarzule
and
toshmere
the
writer
of
the
history
had
apparently
been
one
of
the
sirenian
scientists
a
confidant
and
friend
of
toshmere
who
had
been
close
to
him
in
those
last
days
he
had
been
one
of
the
few
to
witness
the
descent
of
the
two
into
the
depths
of
the
planet
but
he
knew
nothing
of
what
happened
when
they
reached
the
bottom
and
sealed
the
repository
did
not
know
which
one
had
survived
in
that
mighty
struggle
that
must
have
taken
place
and
shortly
no
one
of
the
sirenians
cared
what
the
fate
of
their
deserting
hetrarra
might
have
been
for
the
great
dragboran
fleet
was
upon
them
with
the
mighty
unknown
weapon
that
struck
terror
to
the
mightiest
of
sirenia
they
sped
out
of
space
and
swiftly
nullified
the
sirenian
defenses
it
was
a
carnage
that
was
frightful
even
to
the
sirenians
so
schooled
in
the
methods
of
shedding
blood
their
defenses
might
not
have
existed
for
all
the
effect
they
had
on
their
enemy
at
first
one
by
one
and
then
by
tens
the
operators
were
touched
by
death
and
their
machines
turned
to
molten
ruin
at
last
when
only
incandescent
metal
and
sprawling
dead
lay
of
the
sirenian
fleet
the
enemy
ships
withdrew
and
the
handful
of
survivors
dared
hope
that
there
might
be
escape
for
them
but
there
was
none
as
the
fleet
withdrew
beyond
their
vision
a
single
small
ship
appeared
in
the
heavens
and
they
screamed
with
the
knowledge
of
what
it
was
but
they
were
dead
long
before
the
planet
exploded
into
its
component
fragments
which
hurtled
in
all
directions
into
space
underwood
put
the
manuscript
down
his
mind
reluctant
to
close
the
scene
of
vast
and
terrible
battle
that
had
occurred
so
long
ago
it
had
answered
some
of
the
problems
raised
by
asteroidal
archeology
it
explained
the
utter
lack
of
relationship
between
stroid
iii
which
was
the
language
of
the
sirenians
and
stroid
i
and
ii
which
were
undoubtedly
native
to
the
vanished
planet
but
this
snatch
of
history
prepared
by
the
unknown
scientist
companion
of
toshmere
raised
the
greatest
enigma
of
all
illia
eyes
looked
up
into
underwood
who
could
have
won
she
said
if
it
was
toshmere
the
alien
will
be
all
that
we
hoped
he
would
be
if
it
is
demarzule
then
terry
is
right
he
should
be
destroyed
underwood
glanced
out
toward
the
nutrient
bath
where
the
alien
slept
where
the
shadowy
outlines
of
a
faintly
human
figure
already
appeared
in
the
misty
depths
of
the
nutrient
solution
it
got
to
be
toshmere
he
said
and
hoped
he
was
right
the
viewing
balcony
above
the
floor
of
the
museum
hall
was
completed
and
the
disciples
of
the
great
one
began
to
flow
through
in
a
stream
to
underwood
it
was
a
sickening
revolting
sight
as
he
watched
the
faces
of
those
who
came
and
worshipped
at
the
shrine
he
saw
them
transformed
as
if
they
had
seen
some
great
vision
they
came
with
burdens
of
care
lining
their
faces
all
ages
young
and
old
and
they
left
with
shining
eyes
and
uplifted
faces
there
were
even
sick
and
crippled
who
came
and
left
crutches
eyeglasses
and
trusses
twice
a
day
william
hennessey
stood
upon
the
balcony
and
uttered
a
prayer
to
the
great
one
and
the
stream
of
fanatic
worshipers
stopped
and
bowed
down
one
of
underwood
biologists
craven
was
so
fascinated
by
the
exhibition
of
mass
hysteria
that
he
asked
for
permission
to
make
a
study
of
it
underwood
forced
the
spectacle
out
of
his
mind
he
knew
he
endure
staying
there
at
the
museum
if
he
allowed
his
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
decadence
of
mankind
the
mass
of
protoplasm
in
the
nutrient
bath
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
typical
mammalian
embryo
anthropomorphic
in
most
respects
but
with
differences
that
illia
and
underwood
could
not
assign
to
the
natural
development
of
the
creature
or
to
the
unusual
circumstances
of
its
revival
because
there
was
no
standard
with
which
to
compare
it
then
one
day
near
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
underwood
received
an
urgent
call
from
phyfe
come
over
at
once
he
said
we
found
the
answer
in
the
repository
we
know
who
the
great
one
is
who
i
want
you
to
see
for
yourself
underwood
swore
as
phyfe
cut
off
he
turned
his
observations
over
to
the
operator
on
duty
and
left
the
building
the
lexicography
and
philography
sections
of
the
institute
were
in
an
old
sprawling
block
across
the
city
by
the
spaceport
the
semantics
section
was
also
housed
there
the
repository
had
been
taken
there
for
continued
examination
dreyer
and
phyfe
met
him
the
old
archeologist
was
trembling
with
excitement
i
found
the
mummy
he
said
what
mummy
the
mummy
of
the
one
in
the
repository
who
was
killed
by
the
successful
one
who
was
it
you
see
he
left
a
record
for
the
discoverers
of
the
repository
they
went
into
the
enclosure
that
had
been
built
to
house
the
alien
structure
inside
the
repository
looked
many
times
the
size
it
had
appeared
in
space
underwood
followed
them
into
the
familiar
passages
they
went
down
into
the
main
chamber
which
had
held
the
protoplasm
of
the
great
one
then
underwood
observed
an
opening
leading
lower
down
you
found
a
way
into
the
rest
of
the
repository
yes
and
how
unfortunate
we
were
not
to
have
found
our
way
into
that
portion
first
but
come
phyfe
disappeared
through
the
narrow
opening
and
they
passed
three
levels
filled
with
unknown
artifacts
then
at
last
they
came
to
the
smallest
chamber
formed
by
the
curve
of
the
outside
hull
it
was
too
small
for
them
to
stand
upright
and
filled
rapidly
with
dreyer
cigar
smoke
there
it
is
right
where
we
found
it
said
phyfe
underwood
looked
at
the
thing
without
recognition
it
appeared
as
if
a
rather
huge
bat
had
been
carelessly
tossed
into
the
corner
of
the
chamber
completely
dessicated
said
phyfe
he
did
stay
here
long
enough
between
his
death
and
the
destruction
of
the
planet
for
decay
to
set
in
he
simply
dried
up
as
the
molecules
of
water
were
frozen
and
dispersed
i
wish
there
were
some
way
the
biologists
could
find
to
restore
him
he
so
shapeless
it
difficult
to
tell
what
he
looked
like
but
who
is
he
here
is
the
record
he
left
apparently
they
had
some
kind
of
small
electric
tool
they
carried
with
them
to
write
on
metallic
surfaces
how
they
read
them
is
a
mystery
because
we
have
to
have
a
mass
of
equipment
as
big
as
this
chamber
to
decipher
the
stuff
here
are
photographs
of
his
message
that
we
have
rendered
visible
underwood
took
the
sheaf
of
photographs
they
showed
the
walls
of
the
chamber
including
the
dried
mummy
lying
inert
where
it
had
fallen
in
pain
and
death
but
standing
out
in
sharp
white
characters
was
a
lengthy
inscription
written
by
the
ancient
creature
of
eons
ago
can
you
read
it
asked
phyfe
underwood
scanned
the
characters
and
nodded
slowly
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
up
on
the
language
as
phyfe
had
but
he
could
read
it
now
with
fair
facility
the
first
part
of
the
message
was
a
brief
reiteration
of
the
history
of
the
refugees
that
he
already
knew
but
then
he
came
to
a
fresh
portion
demarzule
has
slain
me
the
message
read
the
words
were
like
pellets
of
ice
suddenly
shot
with
bullet
speed
into
his
face
he
looked
up
at
the
impassive
faces
of
the
other
two
men
and
read
there
the
decision
they
had
made
then
slowly
his
eyes
lowered
to
the
sheet
again
and
he
went
on
deliberately
with
the
reading
i
have
attempted
to
get
to
the
main
chamber
and
destroy
the
transformation
equipment
but
i
can
not
demarzule
has
learned
how
to
operate
the
equipment
though
there
is
nothing
creative
in
him
and
all
his
aims
are
of
conquest
and
destruction
he
still
has
the
command
of
vast
stores
of
sirenian
science
i
am
not
a
warrior
or
clever
in
the
ways
of
fighting
it
was
not
difficult
for
demarzule
to
best
me
i
die
soon
therefore
it
is
for
you
who
may
read
this
in
the
ages
to
come
this
is
my
message
to
you
my
warning
destroy
the
contents
of
the
protoplasm
chamber
without
mercy
demarzule
is
there
and
he
will
be
the
scourge
of
any
civilization
in
which
he
arises
he
dreams
of
conquest
and
he
will
not
rest
until
he
is
master
of
the
universe
he
has
destroyed
galaxies
he
will
destroy
others
if
he
lives
again
kill
him
erase
all
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
sirenian
empire
from
your
memory
should
you
be
tempted
to
restore
the
hetrarra
and
believe
your
science
a
match
for
ours
remember
that
the
knowledge
required
to
enter
this
repository
is
only
the
minimum
it
is
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
our
civilization
therefore
kill
the
record
ended
with
the
last
scrawled
admonition
of
the
ancient
scientist
toshmere
for
long
moments
the
chamber
of
the
repository
was
silent
phyfe
made
no
comment
as
underwood
finished
he
saw
the
tensing
of
the
jaw
and
the
staring
fixation
of
his
eyes
as
if
he
would
penetrate
the
ages
with
his
naked
vision
and
try
to
picture
the
dying
scientist
scrawling
his
message
on
the
walls
of
the
death
chamber
then
phyfe
said
at
last
we
ca
risk
the
revival
of
demarzule
now
del
think
what
it
would
mean
to
turn
loose
a
mentality
having
command
of
such
a
superior
science
we
not
exactly
planning
to
turn
him
loose
said
underwood
defensively
we
still
have
control
when
he
revives
he
can
be
kept
in
suitable
confinement
and
finally
disposed
of
if
necessary
it
seems
worth
it
if
we
could
tap
the
science
he
knows
are
you
forgetting
that
we
do
have
control
of
him
in
any
sense
of
the
word
the
disciples
have
we
under
direction
of
the
institute
which
can
be
wiped
out
in
an
instant
by
the
science
committee
they
in
turn
are
mere
puppets
of
the
disciples
who
hold
the
voting
power
when
demarzule
revives
he
have
a
ready
made
following
who
regard
him
not
only
as
emperor
but
as
god
i
tell
you
we
have
no
alternative
but
destruction
underwood
jaws
tightened
further
within
his
grasp
was
a
science
that
might
represent
thousands
of
years
of
normal
development
of
the
solar
system
he
could
not
give
up
a
gift
such
as
the
sirenian
culture
offered
then
his
eyes
found
those
of
dreyer
who
had
said
nothing
who
sat
on
his
heels
placidly
in
his
haze
of
smoke
and
there
he
read
the
irrevocable
answer
all
right
he
said
you
win
you
and
old
toshmere
let
get
inside
to
a
phone
and
i
give
the
word
to
turn
the
radiation
off
swiftly
now
they
clambered
up
the
stairs
as
if
to
escape
some
foul
tomb
of
the
they
hurried
into
the
building
and
into
the
office
of
phyfe
there
underwood
called
illia
she
answered
instantly
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
for
his
message
fearfully
and
without
hope
it
demarzule
the
conqueror
he
said
turn
off
the
radiation
and
drain
the
tank
we
stand
the
consequences
of
that
but
we
dare
not
go
on
with
the
restoration
illia
bit
her
lip
and
nodded
it
might
have
been
earth
great
chance
she
said
and
there
was
something
like
a
sob
in
her
voice
i
turn
it
off
at
once
phyfe
said
know
what
underwood
there
going
to
be
trouble
over
this
i
think
i
ask
for
a
transfer
back
to
the
expedition
would
you
like
to
come
along
with
us
i
suppose
so
but
i
afraid
the
scientific
committee
wo
let
us
get
away
that
easily
you
and
i
are
through
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
did
you
think
of
that
phyfe
we
be
lucky
if
we
do
have
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
prison
but
dreyer
you
do
need
to
be
caught
in
this
get
away
before
they
come
for
us
i
had
considered
it
that
way
said
phyfe
but
i
suppose
right
the
disciples
wo
be
likely
to
let
us
get
away
this
easy
will
they
before
dreyer
could
speak
a
call
came
through
on
the
office
interphone
phyfe
switched
on
and
the
frantic
face
of
esmond
one
of
the
junior
archeologists
appeared
phyfe
the
man
exclaimed
i
do
know
what
it
is
all
about
but
the
police
are
on
the
way
down
to
your
office
they
have
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
you
and
dr
underwood
phyfe
nodded
thanks
esmond
i
see
that
there
no
trouble
for
you
because
of
this
i
appreciate
it
they
did
lose
any
time
did
they
he
said
to
underwood
but
as
long
as
demarzule
has
been
destroyed
we
accomplished
what
we
tried
to
do
wait
a
minute
said
underwood
do
we
know
that
demarzule
has
been
destroyed
something
must
have
gone
wrong
the
police
came
too
quickly
look
shaken
out
of
his
customary
calm
dreyer
was
pointing
through
the
window
across
the
city
there
where
they
knew
the
carlson
to
be
was
a
great
shining
bubble
of
light
a
force
shell
underwood
exclaimed
how
they
have
evidently
been
prepared
for
a
long
time
said
dreyer
underwood
tried
the
phone
again
and
called
for
illia
but
there
was
no
response
from
inside
the
shell
of
impenetrable
energy
a
moment
of
terrible
fear
caught
underwood
up
in
its
turbulence
what
of
illia
was
she
all
right
whatever
the
answer
phyfe
exclaimed
it
a
ten
to
one
shot
that
demarzule
is
not
destroyed
in
which
case
we
better
not
be
taken
what
can
we
do
they
have
the
building
surrounded
there
be
no
chance
of
getting
out
this
is
an
old
building
there
are
rooms
and
that
few
know
about
and
the
staff
are
all
scientists
they
be
loyal
come
on
no
wait
said
underwood
nothing
can
be
gained
by
my
hiding
in
this
rabbit
warren
underneath
the
city
there
is
only
one
chance
of
destroying
demarzule
and
that
is
my
getting
back
to
the
museum
and
doing
it
personally
you
crazy
the
disciples
will
never
let
you
back
in
there
come
on
man
we
wasting
time
you
two
go
on
and
hide
phyfe
i
try
to
lay
the
blame
on
you
and
a
group
of
scientists
and
swear
my
own
innocence
it
the
only
way
to
get
access
to
demarzule
get
going
wait
have
you
got
a
burner
in
the
drawer
there
we
better
take
it
underwood
yanked
open
the
drawer
and
found
the
weapon
then
he
held
the
muzzle
a
short
distance
from
his
upper
arm
and
fired
his
face
twisted
involuntarily
with
pain
and
phyfe
stared
in
amazement
what
for
the
archeologist
demanded
underwood
tossed
him
the
weapon
as
the
room
filled
with
the
stench
of
his
burned
flesh
you
shot
me
when
i
refused
to
order
the
radiation
off
it
a
thin
story
and
if
they
wo
believe
it
i
be
a
goner
but
if
we
do
risk
it
demarzule
will
be
the
next
ruler
of
earth
dreyer
nodded
it
a
chance
you
better
take
it
good
luck
a
sudden
commotion
down
the
hall
outside
the
door
warned
of
the
approach
of
the
arresting
officers
phyfe
gave
a
last
despairing
glance
at
underwood
who
was
clutching
the
painful
burn
on
his
arm
the
archeologist
turned
and
darted
swiftly
through
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
office
followed
by
dreyer
almost
instantly
the
main
door
was
flung
wide
and
two
heavily
armed
officers
burst
into
the
room
their
impulsive
charge
was
halted
as
they
stared
at
the
groaning
physicist
get
help
underwood
said
desperately
i
got
to
get
to
the
museum
it
may
not
be
too
late
if
morov
turned
the
beam
off
phyfe
forced
me
to
order
it
stopped
scientists
do
want
the
great
one
revived
he
shot
me
when
i
refused
would
have
killed
me
if
underwood
sagged
forward
over
the
desk
and
fainted
from
the
pain
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
beefy
committee
chairman
regarded
underwood
in
the
crowded
hearing
room
with
the
detached
anger
of
one
who
represents
approximately
a
million
voters
he
told
underwood
the
reprieve
you
have
been
granted
is
not
given
because
your
crime
is
considered
any
less
grievous
because
your
act
threatened
a
possession
of
this
government
which
may
potentially
change
the
entire
life
of
earth
for
the
better
your
crime
is
deemed
punishable
by
death
however
you
are
the
only
man
capable
of
directing
the
project
therefore
your
sentence
is
commuted
and
will
be
resolved
if
you
successfully
conclude
the
project
of
restoring
the
great
one
only
by
so
doing
may
you
prove
your
innocence
if
an
accident
brings
failure
three
separate
committees
of
competent
scientists
will
bring
a
verdict
that
will
determine
whether
you
shall
live
and
what
of
illia
morov
her
sentence
is
life
imprisonment
for
her
attempt
to
destroy
the
great
one
she
obeyed
my
orders
given
under
duress
as
i
have
explained
i
can
not
be
responsible
for
the
successful
restoration
if
i
am
to
be
denied
competent
assistance
her
knowledge
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
success
of
the
work
the
chairman
frowned
the
civil
courts
have
exercised
judgment
it
may
be
possible
for
her
to
be
bound
over
to
us
as
you
were
but
her
sentence
can
not
be
commuted
except
by
special
appeal
and
retrial
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
in
the
matter
underwood
choked
back
the
blast
he
would
like
to
have
hurled
his
denunciation
of
everything
that
symbolized
the
rotten
culture
into
which
he
had
been
driven
by
accident
of
birth
he
dared
hope
only
that
illia
would
be
granted
leniency
that
somehow
they
could
think
of
a
way
to
destroy
the
alien
he
had
forced
his
mind
shut
against
all
possibilities
of
antagonism
between
the
culture
of
sirenia
and
that
of
earth
now
he
was
aware
of
the
full
potentialities
of
a
mind
like
demarzule
armed
with
sirenian
loose
among
earthmen
and
he
was
motivated
by
an
urge
to
destroy
that
was
as
great
as
his
former
desire
to
save
and
restore
earth
was
in
bad
enough
shape
without
a
demarzule
for
himself
and
for
illia
he
almost
dared
hope
that
they
might
find
escape
from
the
wrath
of
the
disciples
perhaps
to
the
venusian
colonies
for
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
upon
earth
the
chairman
added
with
deadly
significance
just
to
make
sure
that
no
risk
is
being
taken
with
the
great
one
you
will
be
constantly
attended
by
an
armed
guard
you
will
carefully
explain
every
move
before
you
make
it
otherwise
you
may
not
be
alive
to
make
it
that
was
all
then
underwood
was
led
out
under
heavy
guard
between
the
rows
of
watchers
most
of
whom
were
disciples
he
could
almost
feel
the
doubt
and
hate
directed
toward
him
when
he
returned
to
the
museum
guards
of
the
disciples
stood
everywhere
the
scientists
worked
with
blank
expressionless
faces
and
guns
at
their
backs
craven
the
biologist
who
had
made
detailed
studies
of
the
disciples
glanced
up
from
his
desk
uncertainly
as
underwood
walked
in
he
had
been
placed
in
charge
temporarily
during
the
absence
of
illia
and
underwood
i
sorry
about
everything
del
especially
about
morov
when
i
saw
her
turning
off
the
radiation
i
knew
that
something
was
wrong
but
when
she
said
that
word
had
come
from
you
to
do
it
i
knew
it
was
time
for
us
to
take
over
i
glad
that
they
found
you
were
not
in
sympathy
with
the
scientists
who
wanted
the
great
one
destroyed
his
words
refused
to
fall
into
place
in
underwood
mind
so
that
they
made
sense
but
after
a
moment
it
came
though
there
were
personal
guards
attached
to
every
other
scientist
in
the
place
there
was
none
standing
watch
over
craven
so
craven
was
one
of
them
a
disciple
and
if
craven
why
not
others
but
the
biologist
had
been
studying
the
disciples
from
a
scientific
standpoint
had
he
succumbed
in
spite
of
that
or
because
of
it
it
was
a
problem
beyond
underwood
grasp
he
evaded
a
reply
with
how
is
everything
going
is
the
cell
division
increasing
intensities
of
radiation
and
nutrient
solution
being
stepped
up
according
to
our
plans
craven
nodded
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
great
one
is
developing
properly
you
want
to
make
a
complete
check
of
course
the
daily
reports
are
ready
for
your
inspection
underwood
grunted
and
left
followed
by
the
silent
guard
he
went
out
to
the
test
board
where
the
trio
of
technicians
kept
constant
watch
on
the
processes
everything
was
functioning
according
to
instructions
in
the
repository
instructions
prepared
by
toshmere
everywhere
were
the
guards
and
up
on
the
balcony
were
the
unending
streams
of
disciples
of
the
great
one
it
was
like
a
nightmare
to
underwood
how
had
control
of
the
project
slipped
away
it
had
happened
so
rapidly
and
insidiously
that
he
had
not
been
aware
but
that
was
not
it
the
truth
was
that
he
had
never
had
control
from
the
moment
that
the
scientists
brought
the
protoplasm
of
demarzule
to
earth
and
revealed
the
story
of
their
find
it
had
been
inevitable
inevitable
underwood
thought
and
the
greatest
semantic
blunder
ever
made
it
might
have
been
a
good
thing
if
it
had
been
toshmere
instead
of
demarzule
the
world
had
had
no
leaders
for
a
century
except
the
bungling
politicians
toshmere
might
have
led
them
back
to
a
semblance
of
strength
and
initiative
but
what
would
the
conqueror
and
destroyer
demarzule
do
the
following
day
illia
returned
underwood
was
shocked
by
her
appearance
she
had
dreamed
of
a
new
and
saner
world
to
be
brought
by
the
alien
out
of
space
just
as
underwood
had
dreamed
of
a
new
world
of
science
to
be
revealed
and
now
their
dreams
had
turned
into
a
monster
the
worst
of
their
meeting
was
that
there
was
nothing
they
could
say
to
each
other
illia
came
into
the
tiny
world
of
nightmare
under
the
force
shell
in
the
custody
of
guards
and
one
remained
constantly
by
her
side
as
she
resumed
her
duties
likewise
underwood
own
guard
never
left
him
underwood
had
to
maintain
his
pretense
of
innocence
before
them
it
was
phyfe
and
dreyer
he
said
to
illia
i
glad
you
succeed
in
destroying
demarzule
she
hesitated
an
instant
then
nodded
with
understanding
i
know
what
you
were
doing
but
i
supposed
there
was
some
reason
i
did
suspect
their
evil
plot
and
that
was
all
there
was
nothing
more
they
could
say
nothing
of
her
despair
at
her
lusterless
appearance
nothing
of
her
lost
dream
the
mass
grew
and
took
shape
limbs
and
head
and
torso
were
distinctly
formed
and
losing
their
fearsome
embryonic
cast
the
creature
would
be
of
adult
form
and
shape
underwood
saw
and
would
not
represent
a
return
to
infancy
it
was
fully
eight
feet
tall
and
was
humanoid
to
the
extent
of
having
four
limbs
and
head
and
torso
but
the
showed
radical
differences
in
bone
and
joint
structure
one
cranial
and
two
abdominal
organs
were
completely
unfamiliar
and
could
be
identified
by
none
of
the
biologists
on
the
project
for
a
time
underwood
nursed
the
hope
that
these
structural
differences
might
make
it
impossible
for
demarzule
to
survive
on
earth
but
the
further
the
lungs
developed
the
more
evident
it
became
that
the
sirenian
would
adapt
to
the
atmosphere
as
to
food
there
was
little
doubt
that
nourishment
would
be
no
problem
by
the
sixth
month
too
it
was
hopeless
to
assume
that
anything
would
go
wrong
with
the
process
of
restoration
toshmere
had
planned
too
well
underwood
wondered
what
had
become
of
phyfe
and
dreyer
if
they
had
been
captured
and
killed
or
if
they
still
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
ancient
buildings
beneath
the
city
there
had
been
absolutely
no
word
he
had
been
kept
in
complete
isolation
since
their
tragic
failure
he
spoke
to
no
one
except
the
silent
guards
and
his
fellow
technicians
he
knew
of
none
that
he
could
trust
for
he
was
certain
that
among
the
scientists
working
beside
him
there
were
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
spy
upon
him
craven
for
example
had
become
more
sullen
day
by
day
and
now
he
avoided
underwood
almost
continually
as
if
ashamed
of
the
things
that
he
believed
in
and
had
done
but
unable
to
renounce
them
or
help
himself
the
symptoms
of
hysteria
were
becoming
constantly
more
evident
underwood
looked
for
them
in
the
other
scientists
but
he
was
not
skilled
enough
to
detect
all
the
signs
the
only
way
was
to
play
safe
and
take
no
one
into
his
confidence
life
went
on
timelessly
in
the
nightmare
world
the
light
of
day
was
completely
obscured
by
the
force
shell
as
underwood
strolled
out
of
the
museum
building
and
looked
up
at
its
blackness
he
recalled
how
it
had
saved
the
world
centuries
ago
when
mankind
had
once
before
been
on
the
verge
of
in
the
dim
beginnings
of
the
atomic
age
only
by
the
discovery
of
the
force
shell
a
field
impenetrable
by
any
substance
or
radiation
or
force
had
men
been
saved
from
total
annihilation
but
now
man
was
faced
by
another
potent
force
of
destruction
his
own
desire
to
submit
to
any
leader
who
promised
relief
from
independent
responsibility
and
action
the
alien
would
certainly
be
able
to
fulfill
that
promise
where
no
man
could
but
was
it
worth
the
risk
of
being
saddled
with
a
bloody
dictatorship
it
was
fantastic
underwood
thought
that
he
could
find
no
way
to
elude
his
guards
and
kill
the
growing
monster
variations
in
the
strength
of
the
radiation
might
do
it
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
varying
the
radiation
the
guards
whose
leaders
were
technically
trained
had
access
to
the
records
of
the
scientists
which
not
only
gave
the
details
of
previous
work
but
outlined
each
step
until
demarzule
was
restored
underwood
dared
not
attempt
departures
of
procedure
from
the
written
notes
the
bath
itself
had
been
surrounded
by
a
transparent
guard
impervious
to
solid
shot
or
radiation
weapons
even
if
he
could
have
obtained
any
nor
could
poisons
be
placed
in
the
nutrient
solution
there
was
simply
nothing
that
could
be
done
while
demarzule
was
still
in
the
nutrient
bath
but
on
the
day
of
his
arising
a
desperate
plan
formed
in
underwood
mind
he
explained
to
his
guard
when
the
great
one
arises
it
would
be
well
for
someone
to
welcome
him
in
his
own
tongue
only
a
few
of
us
scientists
are
able
to
and
of
those
who
can
i
am
the
only
one
here
with
your
permission
i
be
beside
him
and
welcome
him
when
he
rises
the
guard
considered
i
relay
your
request
to
the
first
high
prophet
hennessey
if
it
is
deemed
fitting
you
shall
be
appointed
to
welcome
the
great
one
underwood
wished
that
he
had
given
hennessey
a
warmer
welcome
that
first
day
when
the
fanatic
prophet
came
to
his
office
but
hennessey
gave
permission
immediately
underwood
imagined
the
prophet
taking
considerable
satisfaction
in
the
irony
of
underwood
being
the
first
to
welcome
the
great
one
mounted
beside
the
narrow
catwalk
between
the
observation
board
and
the
bath
were
the
controls
which
would
finally
cut
the
radiation
and
drain
the
nutrient
solution
as
the
process
of
restoration
came
to
an
end
here
also
were
the
water
valves
used
to
flush
the
bath
when
it
had
first
been
constructed
in
this
narrow
space
underwood
could
escape
the
watching
eye
of
his
guard
for
an
instant
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
cut
the
radiation
and
drain
the
bath
prematurely
if
that
could
be
done
he
might
fill
the
bath
with
water
and
drown
demarzule
before
the
guards
could
intervene
or
reach
the
shutoff
valve
underwood
had
managed
to
secrete
a
small
bar
in
his
pocket
with
which
he
hoped
to
break
the
valve
after
it
was
opened
the
massive
form
of
demarzule
had
been
stirring
like
an
embryo
for
days
now
and
underwood
watched
closely
for
the
first
attempt
to
rise
that
would
be
the
earliest
moment
that
he
could
hope
to
make
an
attempt
to
destroy
the
sirenian
he
wished
he
could
confide
in
illia
but
there
was
no
chance
he
feared
she
might
have
some
desperate
dangerous
plan
of
her
own
the
color
of
the
sirenian
skin
had
turned
a
deep
hue
like
dark
redwood
and
that
appeared
to
be
its
natural
tone
the
hair
upon
the
head
was
coppery
darker
than
the
skin
demarzule
whole
appearance
was
one
of
might
and
strength
even
as
he
lay
quiescent
his
features
were
bold
with
eyes
and
sharp
nose
the
mouth
was
stern
almost
harsh
hysteria
among
the
disciples
was
mounting
hourly
instead
of
flowing
through
the
building
along
the
balcony
in
their
endless
stream
they
poured
in
and
stayed
hoping
to
be
there
for
the
rising
of
the
great
one
some
were
pushed
over
and
killed
by
the
fall
to
the
floor
below
they
overflowed
into
the
main
hall
and
swarmed
about
the
masses
of
equipment
this
was
welcomed
by
underwood
who
hoped
that
the
pressing
mob
might
damage
some
of
the
equipment
and
thus
bring
about
the
end
of
demarzule
in
any
event
the
hysteria
was
having
its
effects
upon
the
guards
who
continued
to
watch
the
scientists
their
alertness
and
efficiency
were
giving
way
to
the
same
tension
that
filled
the
mobs
within
the
hall
like
a
disease
underwood
went
sleepless
for
two
days
at
the
end
not
daring
to
miss
his
one
chance
and
hundreds
of
the
faithful
who
jammed
the
hall
and
thousands
more
who
waited
outside
had
already
stood
that
long
waiting
for
the
miracle
it
was
in
early
dawn
when
underwood
caught
the
first
faint
motion
that
indicated
demarzule
was
about
to
rise
underwood
jerked
a
finger
in
the
direction
of
the
bath
and
looked
questioningly
at
the
guard
the
man
nodded
and
underwood
raced
along
the
narrow
catwalk
there
was
no
question
of
premature
draining
of
the
solution
and
cutting
the
radiation
it
was
time
for
that
now
demarzule
was
struggling
upward
his
lungs
gasping
in
the
first
breath
of
terrestrian
atmosphere
which
filled
the
upper
part
of
the
enclosure
underwood
cut
the
radiation
switch
and
twisted
the
valve
on
the
water
line
with
a
mighty
wrench
that
tore
the
wheel
from
the
shaft
water
flooded
into
the
chamber
demarzule
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
and
stared
as
if
dazed
his
countenance
working
fearsomely
the
disciples
saw
him
a
shout
of
ecstasy
thundered
through
the
great
hall
and
the
empty
rooms
of
the
museum
and
then
suddenly
there
was
a
new
sound
a
single
voice
rang
out
above
all
the
rest
strike
now
it
shouted
strike
down
the
invader
destroy
the
blasphemy
of
the
great
one
underwood
head
twisted
about
there
on
the
balcony
in
the
place
lately
occupied
by
the
prophet
hennessey
was
terry
bernard
for
an
instant
underwood
could
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
it
the
gun
in
terry
hand
flashed
red
underwood
guard
slumped
in
his
murderous
rush
and
fell
from
the
catwalk
he
alone
had
seen
the
sudden
rise
of
water
and
realized
its
meaning
the
cries
and
curses
and
screams
and
prayers
that
filled
the
hall
made
the
previous
commotion
deathly
silence
by
contrast
sudden
beams
of
deadly
fire
shot
through
the
air
and
underwood
could
make
no
sense
of
it
all
sides
in
the
conflict
began
to
appear
underwood
saw
that
some
of
the
technicians
and
scientists
had
weapons
and
had
disposed
of
their
guards
now
they
were
firing
carefully
into
the
mob
about
the
equipment
picking
off
the
armed
leaders
inside
the
impenetrable
enclosure
the
giant
sirenian
staggered
uncertainly
as
if
stunned
the
water
was
rising
swiftly
about
his
hips
the
air
rushing
out
the
oxygen
intake
pipe
allowed
the
water
to
rise
in
the
otherwise
hermetically
sealed
chamber
a
few
minutes
more
and
demarzule
would
be
cut
off
from
the
air
supply
how
long
it
would
take
to
drown
him
underwood
did
not
know
it
would
depend
largely
on
his
present
rate
of
metabolism
which
was
a
great
uncertainty
but
could
the
mob
be
held
off
that
long
they
had
to
be
he
bent
down
and
grabbed
up
the
gun
that
his
pursuing
guard
had
dropped
in
the
background
of
his
mind
he
wondered
what
this
sudden
attack
meant
how
strongly
organized
was
it
and
who
was
behind
it
apparently
terry
had
given
the
signal
for
attack
and
many
of
the
scientists
on
the
project
had
been
prepared
for
it
yet
underwood
had
been
given
not
the
slightest
hint
that
such
attack
would
take
place
he
wondered
why
he
had
been
left
out
the
screaming
of
the
hysterical
disciples
was
deafening
as
those
in
front
tried
to
force
their
way
back
from
the
line
of
battle
and
those
in
the
rear
tried
to
press
forward
to
glimpse
demarzule
underwood
leaped
down
to
the
floor
in
the
sea
of
confusion
and
found
himself
unable
to
determine
which
way
the
conflict
was
moving
none
of
the
scientists
were
near
him
only
the
maddened
unreasoning
disciples
he
decided
to
stay
near
the
water
valve
to
make
certain
that
it
was
not
shut
off
by
any
of
the
guards
then
two
figures
surged
up
to
him
and
one
grasped
his
arm
del
come
on
let
get
out
of
here
he
turned
terry
face
was
almost
unrecognizable
his
other
hand
clutched
illia
arm
you
two
go
on
underwood
shouted
get
out
if
you
can
i
got
to
stay
to
make
sure
he
drowns
the
water
cut
off
ca
you
see
underwood
turned
in
horror
the
water
level
was
falling
instead
of
rising
someone
had
cut
it
off
at
one
of
the
other
valves
farther
along
the
line
and
had
opened
the
drain
air
was
being
pumped
through
for
demarzule
was
standing
rigidly
now
looking
down
upon
the
surging
mass
as
if
contemplating
their
fate
the
bitter
animal
struggle
for
survival
was
gone
now
from
his
face
and
only
a
mocking
scorn
was
there
as
the
mob
battled
before
him
we
failed
underwood
exclaimed
it
must
have
been
craven
who
shut
the
water
off
we
have
a
chance
now
not
if
we
stay
here
come
on
we
can
lose
ourselves
in
this
crowd
and
work
our
way
outside
there
a
ship
waiting
to
take
us
across
to
phyfe
the
is
manned
and
ready
to
go
the
where
who
knows
go
hopelessly
underwood
allowed
himself
to
be
pushed
and
jammed
into
the
thick
of
the
mob
by
the
frantic
terry
signs
of
armed
conflict
were
dying
underwood
supposed
that
the
scientists
had
been
subdued
for
now
the
hall
was
completely
filled
with
the
disciples
it
was
impossible
he
thought
that
they
could
ever
make
their
way
out
without
being
apprehended
but
even
as
doubts
came
he
knew
that
he
had
to
get
out
he
had
to
live
to
make
another
stand
against
the
sirenian
he
looked
back
demarzule
was
standing
erect
now
slowly
his
great
arms
came
up
and
his
hands
extended
as
if
in
blessing
and
welcome
and
the
moaning
of
the
ecstatic
disciples
rose
in
wild
discordance
then
out
of
those
alien
lips
amplified
a
thousand
fold
by
the
audio
system
installed
within
the
chamber
to
catch
any
uttered
words
there
came
an
alien
voice
that
only
underwood
could
understand
and
as
the
strange
words
poured
forth
he
shuddered
at
their
implications
my
people
demarzule
said
my
great
and
mighty
people
underwood
turned
as
if
driven
back
by
the
force
of
the
conquering
voice
of
thunder
that
came
from
the
throat
of
demarzule
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
the
three
scientists
now
the
faces
of
the
disciples
were
upturned
toward
the
great
one
waiting
for
further
pronouncements
underwood
terry
and
illia
shoved
through
the
wide
doors
of
the
hall
against
the
crowd
pressing
from
outside
as
they
fought
through
the
enormous
voice
continued
to
assail
their
ears
i
have
triumphed
over
death
demarzule
exclaimed
i
have
conquered
the
ages
and
now
i
come
to
you
my
people
i
have
come
to
lead
you
to
the
stars
and
to
the
galaxies
beyond
the
stars
where
your
very
name
shall
cause
the
creatures
of
distant
worlds
to
tremble
each
word
was
like
a
knife
stabbing
into
underwood
for
they
showed
that
demarzule
had
already
comprehended
the
situation
and
mastered
it
and
though
the
people
did
not
understand
the
words
the
tone
of
his
voice
carried
the
meaning
almost
equally
well
and
there
were
none
in
that
mass
of
worshipping
disciples
who
doubted
that
a
new
day
of
greatness
had
dawned
for
earth
all
semblance
of
organization
under
the
prophets
and
priests
such
as
hennessey
had
vanished
there
had
never
been
much
organization
because
people
did
not
trust
any
man
sufficiently
to
compose
a
very
tight
or
efficient
organization
this
was
to
the
benefit
of
the
scientists
it
would
take
time
for
demarzule
to
become
aware
of
the
opposition
and
the
identity
of
the
scientists
but
he
must
surely
be
aware
of
the
attempt
on
his
life
underwood
thought
unless
full
consciousness
had
not
returned
until
the
water
had
begun
to
subside
in
the
chamber
and
demarzule
had
not
realized
the
significance
of
it
but
underwood
did
not
believe
that
demarzule
had
exhibited
such
rapid
grasp
of
the
attitude
of
the
disciples
that
he
probably
possessed
a
semantic
accuracy
in
his
thinking
which
would
shame
the
best
of
scientists
the
three
were
making
more
rapid
progress
now
as
they
pushed
out
into
the
part
of
the
mob
that
could
not
see
demarzule
under
the
black
dome
of
the
force
shell
as
far
as
they
could
see
the
area
between
the
building
and
the
outer
edge
of
the
shell
was
filled
with
struggling
humanity
the
words
of
demarzule
could
be
heard
only
faintly
the
north
gate
illia
said
that
is
the
widest
maybe
the
guard
system
has
broken
down
completely
terry
nodded
it
looks
like
it
that
the
closest
to
our
flier
anyway
if
we
are
challenged
let
carry
illia
and
explain
she
was
injured
in
the
mob
that
might
get
us
through
if
not
keep
your
gun
ready
underwood
assented
he
felt
as
if
this
were
some
nightmare
from
which
he
was
struggling
to
awaken
unsuccessfully
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
other
scientists
on
the
project
and
to
those
who
had
attempted
the
storming
of
the
building
had
they
all
perished
in
the
short
and
futile
battle
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
at
times
during
those
long
days
under
the
surveillance
of
the
disciple
guards
he
had
wondered
if
there
would
have
been
some
chance
of
utilizing
demarzule
science
without
danger
that
hope
however
had
been
finally
and
completely
blasted
by
demarzule
arising
the
sirenian
had
not
changed
in
half
a
million
years
as
they
savagely
thrust
through
underwood
considered
the
course
that
would
probably
be
followed
by
demarzule
he
would
gather
about
him
a
puppet
organization
of
administrators
who
would
take
on
a
priestly
sanctification
before
the
people
because
of
their
nearness
to
the
great
one
the
organization
would
tighten
about
the
earth
enfolding
the
willing
devotees
ruthlessly
wiping
out
small
centers
of
opposition
that
might
spring
up
at
the
command
of
the
disciples
would
be
the
world
weapons
and
factories
and
added
to
these
would
be
the
fearful
science
and
unknown
weapons
of
the
sirenian
what
force
could
hold
back
this
avalanche
the
answer
was
there
was
no
force
that
could
touch
him
nothing
the
scientists
could
do
to
prevent
the
unleashed
forces
of
earth
from
sweeping
the
galaxies
flight
that
was
the
only
recourse
for
those
who
wished
to
escape
the
debacle
but
it
must
be
more
than
flight
however
hopeless
it
seemed
those
of
earth
scientists
who
could
be
gathered
must
be
dedicated
to
the
task
of
demarzule
overthrow
the
saving
of
earthmen
from
an
insane
course
of
conquest
close
to
the
north
gate
the
distorting
energies
of
the
force
shell
were
led
around
a
portion
of
space
to
form
an
opening
in
the
wall
word
of
the
rising
of
the
great
one
had
spread
like
a
virus
and
thousands
were
gathered
beyond
the
shell
trying
in
vain
to
force
their
way
in
all
semblance
of
attempting
to
guard
the
entrances
seemed
to
have
vanished
as
the
trio
forced
their
way
through
the
opening
and
out
into
the
sunlight
that
seemed
utterly
blinding
to
illia
and
underwood
who
had
not
seen
it
for
so
long
for
a
moment
underwood
wondered
if
they
could
not
have
remained
inside
the
carlson
and
taken
a
chance
on
shooting
demarzule
when
he
came
out
of
the
protecting
shield
about
the
bath
but
he
knew
better
demarzule
would
not
come
out
until
the
room
was
cleared
and
the
faithful
were
standing
guard
with
their
guns
ready
to
blast
any
assassin
no
they
were
on
the
only
course
open
to
them
they
were
committed
to
it
now
there
was
no
turning
back
at
last
they
came
out
into
a
relatively
free
space
where
they
could
move
rapidly
underwood
caught
sight
of
the
small
flier
atop
a
low
rise
a
mile
from
the
museum
what
about
the
others
underwood
said
as
they
ran
did
any
of
them
get
away
i
do
think
so
terry
answered
we
did
expect
it
our
object
was
to
destroy
demarzule
and
failing
that
to
get
you
two
the
two
running
men
one
with
bandaged
arm
and
the
other
with
bloodsmeared
face
and
the
girl
were
attracting
unwelcome
attention
but
at
last
they
came
to
the
rise
where
the
flier
lay
and
climbed
in
without
a
lost
motion
terry
worked
the
controls
and
they
whirled
into
the
air
from
their
elevation
underwood
looked
back
toward
the
museum
the
holy
sanctuary
of
the
disciples
the
roads
leading
to
the
site
were
black
with
humanity
as
the
faithful
streamed
to
the
building
to
witness
the
great
one
and
hear
his
voice
he
turned
to
terry
bring
me
up
to
date
they
contacted
me
i
was
suspected
by
the
police
you
know
and
we
organized
a
small
group
of
the
scientists
we
felt
we
could
trust
we
told
them
all
about
demarzule
and
our
blunder
in
bringing
him
back
we
organized
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
him
by
any
means
possible
but
of
course
we
had
no
means
the
force
shell
prevented
direct
attack
on
the
carlson
so
we
tried
filtering
in
with
the
disciples
four
of
us
were
caught
and
killed
we
did
try
to
communicate
with
you
because
we
felt
it
was
too
dangerous
and
knew
that
you
would
be
doing
anything
possible
we
succeeded
in
getting
enough
of
our
number
in
for
the
end
of
the
show
and
passing
weapons
to
some
of
the
scientists
on
the
project
but
we
apparently
lost
all
our
men
without
doing
damage
to
the
great
one
only
getting
ourselves
lost
in
that
mob
saved
us
three
i
suspect
that
they
feel
so
secure
in
the
protection
of
demarzule
now
that
that
is
their
only
reason
for
not
gassing
the
whole
mob
in
order
to
get
us
what
your
next
move
asked
illia
the
came
in
two
weeks
ago
for
supplies
most
of
the
crew
are
on
our
side
and
the
rest
are
there
any
more
phyfe
and
dreyer
are
already
aboard
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
scientists
of
our
group
all
we
can
do
is
point
the
nose
up
and
get
going
as
fast
as
we
can
travel
it
may
be
only
a
matter
of
hours
until
demarzule
is
aware
of
us
and
sends
a
fleet
in
pursuit
after
we
get
out
into
space
the
rest
is
up
to
the
boss
he
jerked
a
thumb
in
underwood
direction
what
do
you
mean
asked
underwood
i
mean
that
as
physicist
and
the
only
one
besides
us
somewhat
archeologists
and
semanticists
who
understands
the
sirenian
lingo
not
to
mention
your
familiarity
with
demarzule
you
got
yourself
elected
chairman
of
this
delegation
underwood
laughed
shortly
and
bitterly
i
responsible
for
the
mess
so
i
should
be
the
one
responsible
for
finding
a
way
out
is
that
it
we
turn
you
over
to
the
psychiatric
department
if
you
do
cut
that
out
said
terry
grimly
sorry
i
grateful
of
course
that
the
rest
of
you
think
i
could
be
useful
but
i
afraid
my
brain
is
a
complete
blank
on
how
to
get
out
maybe
you
think
the
rest
of
us
are
the
same
way
said
terry
but
you
the
most
qualified
of
us
all
to
recognize
a
means
of
licking
demarzule
when
you
see
it
underwood
stared
ahead
of
them
toward
the
expanding
view
of
the
buildings
where
the
scientists
had
held
out
against
the
disciples
he
tried
to
picture
what
the
past
months
had
been
for
them
but
he
could
never
know
the
hundreds
of
desperate
escapes
and
skirmishes
with
guards
and
officers
and
swift
murders
in
the
depths
below
the
city
beside
the
clustered
buildings
the
great
laboratory
spaceship
lay
on
the
experimental
grounds
shining
in
the
early
dawn
sudden
bright
spurts
of
light
showed
on
the
field
illia
saw
it
first
gunfire
she
cried
they
being
attacked
terry
exclaimed
we
got
to
get
down
there
or
they
may
have
to
leave
without
us
get
out
that
pair
of
heavy
burners
under
your
seat
del
we
have
to
go
in
shooting
underwood
hauled
out
the
weapons
as
the
flier
darted
swiftly
toward
the
field
a
concentrated
knot
of
offense
was
being
offered
from
the
building
entrance
nearest
the
ship
but
other
officers
were
surrounding
the
ship
behind
the
screen
of
the
distant
shrubbery
i
fly
over
them
said
terry
give
them
a
good
blast
with
both
guns
underwood
opened
the
port
against
the
wind
and
pointed
the
noses
of
the
deadly
weapons
outward
he
clicked
the
trigger
and
an
unending
stream
of
fire
hurled
toward
the
earth
sweeping
through
the
lines
of
attackers
as
they
crouched
behind
the
shrubs
and
fences
then
swiftly
terry
spun
the
ship
to
avoid
the
building
and
they
zoomed
upward
at
that
instant
a
crippling
beam
came
from
below
we
hit
terry
exclaimed
it
killed
the
motor
hang
on
for
a
crash
landing
i
try
to
make
the
port
of
the
ship
underwood
returned
his
attention
to
the
guns
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
as
the
nose
dipped
he
fired
into
the
building
from
which
the
disabling
shot
had
come
he
thought
he
heard
a
scream
of
pain
though
it
might
have
been
only
the
sound
of
the
wind
against
the
shell
of
the
little
flier
they
were
falling
fast
now
heading
for
the
open
port
of
the
large
spaceship
they
could
see
some
of
the
crew
members
and
scientists
emerging
weapons
ready
to
protect
their
landing
they
sped
down
below
the
level
of
the
top
of
the
hull
and
the
vast
sheets
of
plate
seemed
to
flow
past
the
port
of
the
flier
like
a
river
of
steel
it
stopped
flowing
they
hit
hard
and
terry
yanked
open
the
door
they
tumbled
out
in
the
midst
of
their
defenders
while
spurts
of
flame
showed
in
the
sunlight
all
about
them
get
in
one
of
the
men
shouted
we
almost
had
to
leave
without
you
they
be
bringing
reinforcements
it
was
mason
the
physicist
underwood
nodded
we
ready
is
everyone
else
aboard
who
is
going
yes
there
was
a
sudden
cry
beside
underwood
and
one
of
the
crewmen
dropped
his
gun
and
clutched
an
arm
in
pain
mason
and
terry
clutched
him
in
supporting
arms
and
dragged
him
into
the
vessel
underwood
clasped
illia
hand
and
hurried
through
the
port
behind
them
the
last
of
the
men
slammed
the
door
and
dogged
it
tight
phyfe
waiting
for
you
in
the
control
room
mason
said
we
take
care
of
peters
here
terry
had
better
stay
for
treatment
also
underwood
nodded
and
raced
along
the
corridor
with
illia
they
passed
other
men
intent
upon
their
own
tasks
some
of
them
he
knew
others
he
had
never
seen
before
he
hoped
that
phyfe
and
terry
had
chosen
carefully
the
remembrance
of
the
biologist
craven
came
to
his
mind
they
came
to
the
entrance
to
the
control
room
captain
dawson
was
in
technical
command
waiting
for
instructions
to
take
off
apparently
mason
was
assuming
charge
of
the
takeoff
for
his
voice
came
through
the
audio
system
as
underwood
entered
phyfe
nodded
assent
to
captain
dawson
take
it
up
almost
instantly
the
ship
soared
aloft
wait
underwood
exclaimed
as
he
entered
the
control
room
phyfe
and
dawson
looked
toward
the
door
there
can
be
no
waiting
said
phyfe
we
had
almost
given
up
you
and
terry
and
illia
the
police
have
been
searching
for
us
for
weeks
and
now
that
we
out
in
the
open
they
spare
no
force
to
take
us
we
ca
go
without
the
stroid
records
said
underwood
terry
tells
me
i
been
elected
to
head
this
outfit
if
that
so
then
my
first
order
is
to
pick
up
every
scrap
of
stroid
record
and
artifact
that
has
ever
been
found
before
we
take
off
dreyer
came
in
and
looked
interestedly
as
underwood
spoke
but
he
said
nothing
why
said
phyfe
i
do
understand
there
was
a
weapon
said
underwood
a
weapon
that
the
sirenians
were
afraid
of
which
apparently
was
responsible
for
the
power
of
the
dragbora
over
them
if
any
trace
of
that
weapon
remains
in
the
universe
our
goal
is
to
find
it
it
may
be
our
one
hope
of
defeating
demarzule
the
others
looked
at
him
as
if
doubting
his
sanity
yet
hoping
he
was
on
the
trail
of
a
solution
but
that
was
five
hundred
thousand
years
ago
said
phyfe
how
could
we
hope
to
find
such
a
weapon
that
disappeared
that
long
ago
we
have
no
clues
we
have
the
stroid
records
that
why
i
want
them
but
the
sirenians
seemed
to
know
nothing
about
the
nature
of
the
weapon
we
not
so
sure
of
that
but
even
if
that
so
there
was
the
great
civilization
of
the
dragbora
we
do
know
that
it
is
extinct
and
we
know
nothing
of
its
location
but
the
weapon
may
be
there
and
the
clue
to
location
may
be
in
the
stroid
records
dreyer
nodded
and
gave
a
violent
puff
of
smoke
he
right
phyfe
we
had
thought
of
it
but
that
may
be
our
one
chance
at
least
it
gives
us
an
objective
instead
of
just
plunging
into
purposeless
flight
i
suppose
so
phyfe
said
doubtfully
but
i
do
see
how
i
take
care
of
that
show
us
where
the
records
are
we
get
the
repository
first
however
i
want
the
whole
thing
brought
aboard
underwood
turned
swiftly
to
dawson
and
ordered
the
ship
lowered
beside
the
temporary
structure
housing
the
repository
near
the
stroid
museum
building
then
he
stepped
to
the
ship
interphone
and
explained
their
maneuver
he
called
for
twenty
volunteers
to
man
scooters
and
weapons
to
cover
those
who
were
to
transfer
the
records
below
them
on
the
ground
the
police
forces
who
watched
their
prey
escape
stood
puzzledly
as
the
turned
and
moved
slowly
across
the
group
of
buildings
and
began
dropping
again
three
deadly
police
fliers
hovered
in
the
air
about
the
great
spaceship
it
was
the
fliers
that
underwood
watched
with
intent
study
the
twenty
men
he
had
selected
out
of
the
volunteers
gathered
around
the
viewing
plates
with
him
the
first
objective
will
be
to
down
those
fliers
said
underwood
then
you
will
provide
constant
cover
for
those
of
us
who
leave
the
ship
to
bring
the
records
back
go
to
your
assigned
airlocks
signal
when
the
fliers
are
in
the
best
position
for
one
group
of
you
to
attack
it
byers
the
engineer
mechanic
appointed
captain
of
the
group
nodded
they
wo
know
what
hit
he
promised
i
hope
so
said
underwood
all
right
take
your
stations
and
signal
when
you
ready
the
men
filed
out
of
the
room
while
the
big
ship
slowly
settled
toward
the
earth
the
three
police
fliers
continued
to
move
about
with
deadly
inquisitiveness
then
the
sudden
signal
from
byers
indicated
the
men
were
positioned
and
ready
underwood
watched
the
fliers
one
was
out
of
sight
of
the
other
two
near
the
nose
of
the
underwood
called
sharply
number
three
attack
almost
instantly
a
lock
opened
behind
the
unsuspecting
police
flier
and
three
scooters
darted
out
their
riders
firing
a
deadly
stream
which
came
to
a
focus
on
the
tail
of
the
flier
a
sudden
blossom
of
flame
sent
up
a
plume
of
black
smoke
and
the
flier
nosed
earthward
without
its
occupants
knowing
what
had
struck
but
now
the
second
flier
was
rounding
the
hull
and
the
three
scooters
were
spotted
the
police
fired
and
one
scooter
plummeted
out
of
sight
number
seven
underwood
ordered
a
lock
near
the
top
of
the
hull
opened
and
a
second
trio
of
scooters
darted
out
the
flier
was
beneath
them
and
its
pilots
had
time
to
look
up
and
see
the
blasting
fire
that
poured
through
the
transparent
bubble
over
them
but
they
had
no
time
to
retaliate
fire
began
rising
from
the
ground
forces
now
and
the
scooter
riders
were
forced
to
dodge
and
twist
to
avoid
being
hit
at
the
same
time
they
dived
close
to
the
ground
and
sprayed
the
attackers
from
above
however
the
third
flier
joined
with
devastating
fury
two
more
scooters
dropped
underwood
ordered
the
remaining
scooters
to
the
attack
simultaneously
they
poured
from
the
ship
swept
over
the
remaining
flier
in
a
wave
of
destruction
and
dropped
it
onto
the
ground
forces
the
latter
spread
out
now
and
hunted
for
cover
before
the
mounting
destruction
of
the
scooter
riders
align
cargo
hatch
number
one
by
the
repository
shelter
underwood
instructed
the
captain
we
load
that
first
the
ship
settled
to
the
surface
without
a
jar
the
immediate
area
around
the
shelter
was
cleared
mason
taking
charge
of
the
loading
ordered
the
hatch
swung
open
portable
cargo
units
were
passed
out
and
strapped
to
the
periphery
of
the
huge
faceted
artifact
whose
bulk
almost
filled
the
hatchway
sporadic
fire
continued
from
the
hidden
police
but
the
scooter
riders
were
holding
it
below
an
effective
level
without
losing
any
more
of
their
own
number
mason
turned
the
current
into
the
cargo
units
and
slowly
the
huge
mass
rose
from
the
spot
where
it
rested
then
a
attached
to
it
began
reeling
in
drawing
the
repository
toward
the
ship
as
the
hatch
clanged
shut
over
it
underwood
exhaled
heavily
the
main
part
of
our
job
another
half
hour
to
scoop
up
the
records
in
the
building
and
we
be
through
illia
gave
a
sudden
shrill
cry
del
the
building
it
on
fire
the
men
stared
from
the
museum
where
the
stroid
records
lay
there
rose
billows
of
smoke
and
licking
flames
they
must
have
known
what
we
were
after
said
phyfe
and
they
fired
the
building
there
no
chance
now
of
getting
any
of
them
yes
there
is
most
of
the
records
are
metallic
underwood
stepped
to
the
interphone
every
man
but
the
takeoff
crew
in
spacesuits
carry
sidearms
and
be
ready
to
enter
the
museum
at
once
what
are
you
going
to
do
illia
cried
already
he
was
at
the
nearest
locker
struggling
into
the
ungainly
spacesuit
these
will
be
enough
protection
from
the
fire
to
enable
each
man
to
bring
out
one
load
perhaps
the
old
building
as
if
symbolic
of
the
times
was
submitting
willingly
to
the
flames
its
ancient
only
partly
fireproofed
construction
was
giving
way
and
the
fire
protection
system
had
failed
completely
rapidly
underwood
went
over
the
plan
phyfe
had
given
him
locating
the
bulk
of
the
records
then
raced
toward
the
cargo
hold
where
the
others
were
nearly
ready
he
ordered
each
pair
of
men
to
tow
a
cargo
carrier
it
was
a
weird
procession
of
unworldly
figures
that
made
their
way
clumsily
from
the
ship
and
up
the
steps
of
the
burning
building
underwood
and
mason
were
together
towing
their
carrier
which
rested
a
foot
off
the
floor
almost
blinded
by
the
smoke
they
led
the
way
through
the
halls
and
into
the
stacks
where
the
records
lay
on
shelves
load
up
this
is
it
underwood
called
like
creatures
in
some
fantastic
hell
he
saw
the
others
file
into
the
large
room
behind
him
they
began
emptying
over
the
shelves
filling
the
carriers
with
whatever
came
to
hand
the
wooden
beams
supporting
the
high
archaic
roof
structure
were
dry
and
roaring
with
flames
somewhere
out
of
their
line
of
sight
a
beam
gave
way
and
a
shower
of
plaster
and
masonry
filled
the
air
there
wo
be
time
for
any
more
mason
said
our
carrier
full
let
go
underwood
shoved
the
carrier
toward
the
doorway
through
which
they
had
come
its
inertia
was
its
only
opposition
you
drag
the
carrier
said
underwood
i
get
another
armful
while
mason
vanished
out
through
the
pall
of
smoke
underwood
scooped
up
another
armful
of
materials
then
almost
blindly
he
sought
the
exit
nearly
all
the
others
were
loaded
and
dragging
their
carriers
now
underwood
glanced
back
what
secrets
might
yet
lie
here
among
the
records
they
must
leave
behind
he
hoped
the
gods
of
chance
had
been
merciful
enough
to
guide
their
hands
toward
some
record
that
would
direct
the
scientists
to
the
ancient
enemy
of
the
sirenian
empire
the
dragbora
whose
dreadful
weapon
had
been
so
feared
by
the
sirenian
hordes
back
in
the
ship
underwood
glanced
back
longingly
at
the
building
it
was
useless
to
attempt
another
trip
the
police
had
apparently
hoped
the
fire
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
scientists
but
after
the
successful
rescue
of
tons
of
records
and
artifacts
they
resumed
their
attack
with
increasing
fury
underwood
called
to
byers
and
the
scooter
riders
to
come
in
slowly
the
protective
forces
withdrew
to
the
ship
and
as
they
did
so
the
police
began
firing
into
the
opening
ports
the
scooters
poured
into
the
ship
more
than
one
bearing
a
mortally
wounded
crewman
altogether
only
fourteen
returned
that
all
byers
said
grimly
the
rest
of
the
boys
wo
be
coming
back
for
a
drastic
moment
of
uncertainty
underwood
wondered
if
his
demand
for
the
records
would
be
worth
that
sacrifice
it
had
to
be
he
told
himself
without
hope
of
a
weapon
to
defeat
the
sirenian
there
was
no
purpose
in
flight
into
space
he
returned
to
the
control
room
and
gave
the
order
to
lift
ship
through
the
ports
underwood
watched
the
nearby
buildings
drop
away
the
sun
disk
shot
up
over
the
horizon
and
bathed
them
in
golden
glow
then
the
pilot
adjusted
the
controls
and
sudden
crushing
acceleration
was
applied
to
the
ship
but
to
the
occupants
it
was
imperceptible
like
the
tired
old
man
that
he
was
phyfe
slumped
down
in
a
cushioned
seat
beside
the
navigator
table
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
since
i
saw
you
last
said
underwood
phyfe
smiled
disparagingly
for
fifty
years
i
been
a
scholar
and
archeologist
it
much
too
late
to
find
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
planetary
crisis
and
expect
to
be
able
to
cope
with
it
you
done
a
fine
job
so
far
i
could
never
even
lead
an
expedition
very
satisfactorily
and
certainly
not
a
group
of
this
kind
terry
might
but
he
lacks
the
physical
knowledge
you
have
mason
might
but
he
knows
nothing
of
the
sirenians
you
the
best
qualified
of
us
all
for
the
job
i
want
to
be
sure
the
rest
think
so
it
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
hold
an
election
we
should
call
a
meeting
of
everyone
anyway
many
of
the
scientists
are
not
adequately
acquainted
with
the
problem
they
should
be
organized
according
to
their
specialties
and
we
ought
to
prepare
some
system
of
defense
with
the
ship
no
farther
than
the
orbit
of
the
moon
a
meeting
was
called
of
the
hundred
and
scientists
and
crewmen
of
the
phyfe
as
nominal
chairman
presented
underwood
formally
as
leader
of
the
group
acceptance
was
unanimous
and
enthusiastic
for
underwood
was
known
to
nearly
all
of
them
by
reputation
if
not
personally
briefly
he
outlined
the
events
concerning
the
discovery
and
restoration
of
demarzule
the
futile
attempts
of
the
scientists
to
stand
against
humanity
demand
for
a
new
god
then
he
called
on
dreyer
to
describe
the
characteristics
of
the
enemy
who
opposed
them
in
the
ages
of
earth
past
history
dreyer
said
there
have
been
conquerors
emperors
dictators
and
tyrants
but
there
has
never
been
demarzule
the
sirenian
to
the
sirenians
conquest
and
leadership
were
as
essential
as
food
there
was
only
one
solution
for
them
as
they
expanded
in
the
galaxy
and
that
was
complete
mastery
of
the
galaxies
or
extinction
it
was
undoubtedly
fortunate
for
our
own
world
that
the
dragbora
succeeded
in
destroying
them
as
to
our
present
problem
demarzule
will
sell
the
peoples
of
earth
the
idea
of
their
complete
superiority
over
all
other
races
in
the
universe
they
ripe
for
acceptance
of
such
doctrine
he
use
the
supernatural
aspect
of
his
appearance
among
us
and
encourage
a
worshipful
attitude
then
he
is
i
think
certain
to
begin
the
construction
of
battle
fleets
and
the
assembly
of
weapons
and
armies
not
the
ships
and
weapons
we
know
but
the
best
that
sirenian
science
could
produce
half
a
million
years
ago
within
a
few
hours
from
now
he
be
sure
to
learn
of
our
escape
and
our
identity
as
enemies
it
is
impossible
to
believe
he
will
not
dispatch
pursuit
ships
to
destroy
us
our
only
chance
is
to
be
too
far
away
for
them
to
catch
up
with
us
at
least
in
terrestrial
ships
by
the
time
sirenian
designs
are
built
we
must
have
an
answer
that
then
is
the
nature
of
the
problem
we
face
our
one
hope
and
it
is
a
slim
one
appears
to
be
the
discovery
of
the
weapon
by
which
the
dragbora
overpowered
the
sirenian
hordes
long
ago
if
we
remain
limited
by
the
range
of
our
own
science
i
am
convinced
the
problem
is
hopeless
though
i
aware
that
happily
there
are
those
of
you
whose
minds
differ
radically
from
mine
and
would
not
admit
defeat
even
with
such
limitations
some
of
you
had
objections
to
our
flight
arguing
that
we
should
remain
and
conduct
an
underground
opposition
movement
you
were
those
who
lacked
a
correct
evaluation
of
our
enemy
i
want
you
to
understand
that
such
a
movement
would
have
been
absolutely
futile
a
successful
underground
movement
must
be
that
of
an
oppressed
majority
against
a
minority
of
ruling
numbers
humanity
demarzule
never
forget
it
that
is
why
we
are
fleeing
but
our
battle
is
not
with
our
fellow
men
their
faults
are
rooted
in
the
dark
processes
of
evolution
and
racial
development
the
appearance
of
demarzule
is
an
extraneous
factor
however
one
that
evolution
did
not
allow
for
without
him
men
would
eventually
attain
maturity
and
balance
out
of
the
conflicts
of
their
racial
adolescence
with
demarzule
as
god
and
leader
generations
of
development
may
be
wiped
out
you
must
remember
that
we
have
committed
ourselves
to
the
only
possible
course
escape
we
nothing
but
children
beside
the
racially
old
demarzule
he
a
superman
from
a
that
outstripped
ours
long
before
our
first
cave
ancestor
discovered
fire
let
us
hope
that
we
find
the
weapon
of
the
dragbora
so
our
kind
may
climb
the
long
evolutionary
ladder
upon
which
they
have
stumbled
so
sorely
after
dreyer
speech
it
was
a
solemn
group
of
men
that
faced
underwood
the
semanticist
had
conveyed
for
the
first
time
to
most
of
them
the
immensity
of
the
threat
that
confronted
them
they
proceeded
then
with
the
organizing
of
the
large
group
into
smaller
units
according
to
their
specialties
underwood
found
there
was
a
preponderance
of
physicists
and
biologists
the
thirty
physicists
were
grouped
under
the
leadership
of
mason
to
them
went
the
task
of
investigating
the
possible
weapons
and
defenses
which
could
be
employed
against
the
attacks
that
would
certainly
come
the
men
with
strictly
engineering
qualifications
were
assigned
to
work
with
mason
group
the
biological
group
included
a
dozen
surgeons
and
four
psychiatrists
under
illia
leadership
dreyer
and
his
fellow
semanticists
were
assigned
with
the
archeologists
to
examine
the
records
they
had
salvaged
from
the
fire
in
the
hopes
of
finding
a
clue
to
the
dragboran
world
and
the
weapon
that
might
be
there
most
of
the
physical
scientists
had
varying
degrees
of
skill
with
machine
tools
and
equipment
and
could
assist
in
the
fabrication
of
armaments
for
the
ship
the
first
task
was
to
rig
the
ship
with
absorbing
screens
to
prevent
radar
echoes
and
nullify
this
means
of
locating
them
from
earth
it
was
a
relatively
easy
project
and
one
that
was
completed
by
the
end
of
their
first
hours
in
space
that
left
only
astronomical
means
by
which
they
could
be
detected
from
earth
and
with
each
passing
hour
this
possibility
became
more
remote
underwood
however
could
not
put
off
the
uneasiness
that
beset
him
in
the
face
of
the
pursuit
he
knew
must
surely
come
six
days
out
and
a
hundred
thousand
light
years
from
earth
phyfe
uncovered
the
first
evidence
that
fortune
was
with
them
he
and
dreyer
along
with
terry
and
underwood
and
the
other
semanticists
and
archeologists
were
working
in
the
single
large
chamber
allotted
to
study
of
the
records
phyfe
sudden
exclamation
burst
upon
the
silence
of
the
room
he
held
up
a
small
metal
roll
fused
on
the
outside
but
unrolled
in
a
spiral
coil
where
he
had
broken
the
fused
portions
away
this
looks
as
if
it
might
have
been
the
log
of
one
of
the
refugee
ships
he
said
look
at
it
underwood
bent
over
the
small
machine
they
had
devised
for
supplying
the
correction
radiation
which
would
render
the
characters
visible
normally
they
stood
out
against
their
dull
metallic
background
like
white
fire
but
these
were
dim
almost
to
the
point
of
obliteration
he
read
slowly
aloud
meathes
one
since
leaving
sirenia
lookout
reports
dragboran
vessels
within
range
a
thousand
of
them
which
means
we
are
outnumbered
ten
to
one
flight
bearings
underwood
looked
up
he
could
read
no
further
those
last
figures
could
they
be
the
relationship
between
his
own
fleet
and
the
home
planet
said
phyfe
more
likely
it
would
be
the
bearings
of
the
dragboran
fleet
in
relation
to
the
sirenians
in
any
case
such
figures
would
be
a
clue
to
the
location
of
the
worlds
because
they
would
be
related
to
their
galactic
references
that
the
catch
though
finding
those
references
to
us
they
would
be
entirely
arbitrary
but
if
this
is
a
log
it
may
give
the
location
of
the
planets
and
their
galaxy
that
we
can
identify
if
we
can
work
out
the
changes
in
astronomical
positions
that
take
place
in
five
hundred
thousand
years
he
took
the
roll
from
the
machine
and
examined
it
more
closely
almost
hopeless
to
get
any
more
out
of
this
is
there
any
other
specimen
that
was
found
in
the
same
locality
phyfe
checked
the
records
and
shook
his
head
this
was
found
stuck
to
a
completely
fused
mass
of
iron
apparently
part
of
the
ship
in
which
it
lay
when
the
dragbora
struck
we
may
as
well
send
it
to
the
lab
for
restoration
if
it
becomes
possible
to
read
it
it
may
help
in
four
hours
the
duplicate
record
came
back
restored
as
completely
as
possible
but
there
were
long
blanks
which
were
underwood
turned
up
the
maximum
radiation
which
helped
bring
out
the
characters
but
also
burned
them
rapidly
away
if
left
on
too
long
suddenly
he
caught
his
breath
listen
to
this
bearings
are
now
sirenia
having
traveled
sirenia
in
two
we
land
perhaps
for
the
last
time
that
it
phyfe
exclaimed
all
but
the
key
to
their
system
said
underwood
do
you
see
any
possibility
of
interpreting
it
dreyer
the
semanticist
shook
his
head
it
must
be
based
upon
entirely
arbitrary
reference
points
as
ours
is
i
see
no
hope
of
interpretation
with
the
figures
we
now
have
perhaps
our
astronomers
could
suggest
something
masterson
and
ebert
the
two
astronomers
included
in
the
group
were
called
in
from
their
task
of
preparing
star
charts
of
the
universe
of
half
a
million
years
ago
they
considered
the
facts
underwood
presented
masterson
said
i
afraid
the
bearings
given
by
the
sirenians
be
much
help
the
distance
is
of
value
that
shows
us
that
we
have
a
shell
at
a
radial
distance
of
approximately
ninety
million
light
years
from
the
solar
system
at
best
then
we
have
this
shell
which
may
be
considered
as
several
thousand
light
years
thick
in
which
to
search
if
we
could
find
even
approximately
the
proper
sector
of
this
shell
we
might
soon
isolate
the
possible
planetary
systems
to
which
the
dragbora
and
sirenians
belonged
but
without
being
able
to
narrow
down
the
possible
sectors
of
that
shell
it
becomes
an
impossible
task
just
a
single
reference
to
some
island
universe
that
we
might
identify
would
do
it
perhaps
underwood
and
dreyer
had
to
agree
they
had
gained
something
if
they
could
just
obtain
one
more
scrap
of
astronomical
information
it
might
give
them
the
key
the
search
for
that
key
went
on
among
the
records
and
artifacts
the
repository
itself
was
searched
inch
by
inch
and
still
almost
none
of
the
artifacts
found
there
could
be
identified
or
explained
apart
from
the
repository
most
of
the
material
they
had
was
native
to
the
planet
on
which
the
sirenians
landed
by
the
eighth
day
mason
crew
had
managed
to
construct
equipment
for
throwing
a
force
shell
about
the
and
underwood
breathed
considerably
easier
they
could
travel
indefinitely
behind
the
protection
of
that
impenetrable
shield
data
for
navigation
was
obtained
through
almost
infinitesimal
pilot
units
set
outside
the
shell
and
connected
through
leads
running
through
equally
small
holes
in
it
underwood
was
proud
of
this
accomplishment
with
their
limited
facilities
for
manufacture
it
was
little
short
of
a
miracle
that
they
had
been
able
to
turn
out
the
mass
of
complex
equipment
in
so
short
a
time
somehow
it
seemed
symbolic
to
him
as
if
there
were
definite
laws
favoring
their
success
the
success
of
earth
and
then
on
that
same
eighth
day
when
they
were
almost
beyond
the
limit
at
which
such
small
dark
objects
could
be
identified
the
lookout
observer
on
duty
sounded
a
warning
to
the
control
center
fleet
departing
from
earth
twenty
warships
corius
type
apparent
course
and
velocity
underwood
looked
at
phyfe
who
was
beside
him
at
the
time
this
is
it
he
said
the
warning
went
throughout
the
ship
and
the
men
looked
up
from
their
tasks
a
moment
then
resumed
with
grimmer
eyes
and
firmer
mouths
mason
group
was
working
on
the
problem
that
had
baffled
armament
men
for
generations
the
problem
of
firing
the
atom
stream
through
the
force
shell
underwood
had
little
confidence
that
they
would
solve
the
problem
but
as
it
was
they
had
no
offense
whatever
as
underwood
and
phyfe
moved
to
the
navigator
table
to
check
their
course
and
that
of
the
pursuing
fleet
he
said
i
wonder
how
they
spotted
us
our
echo
screen
could
have
broken
down
it
must
have
been
sheer
astronomical
luck
that
put
them
on
our
trail
lieutenant
wilson
the
navigator
frowned
as
he
pointed
to
their
course
charts
i
do
believe
that
fleet
is
following
us
he
said
if
they
are
they
going
the
long
way
around
because
their
course
at
present
is
heading
more
than
fourteen
degrees
from
ours
phyfe
and
underwood
studied
the
trajectories
projecting
them
into
space
estimating
the
rate
at
which
the
fleet
would
approach
considering
its
superior
velocity
and
the
divergent
courses
it
easy
enough
to
determine
whether
they
following
or
not
said
underwood
we
could
simply
change
our
own
course
by
ninety
degrees
perhaps
they
have
detected
us
after
all
but
are
merely
shooting
blind
in
the
general
direction
we
might
be
based
only
on
the
observations
of
the
police
as
we
took
off
in
that
case
they
may
hope
merely
to
approach
near
enough
to
obtain
adequate
radar
echoes
dreyer
had
heard
the
news
over
the
interphone
and
came
into
the
navigation
cell
he
overheard
underwood
last
statement
demarzule
would
not
send
out
a
mere
fishing
expedition
he
said
flatly
then
what
the
answer
underwood
asked
but
in
his
own
mind
he
was
evolving
a
wild
theory
he
wondered
if
dreyer
would
confirm
it
if
we
were
merely
going
blindly
into
space
to
escape
demarzule
would
have
no
concern
with
us
but
if
we
were
going
to
a
destination
where
our
arrival
would
be
malevolent
to
him
then
he
would
be
concerned
underwood
eyes
lighted
he
read
in
dreyer
face
the
same
conclusions
he
had
reached
and
demarzule
would
send
his
fleet
not
after
us
particularly
but
to
that
destination
to
see
that
we
did
reach
it
therefore
this
fleet
is
headed
for
the
dragboran
world
not
so
fast
phyfe
objected
demarzule
would
be
assuming
that
we
know
where
it
is
he
has
no
basis
for
such
an
assumption
dreyer
shook
his
head
he
does
know
whether
we
know
the
way
or
not
he
knows
only
that
it
must
be
guarded
from
any
possible
exploitation
by
us
if
we
do
go
there
we
are
no
menace
to
him
if
we
do
the
fleet
is
there
to
take
care
of
us
phyfe
considered
then
slowly
nodded
you
right
and
demarzule
is
going
to
show
us
the
way
to
the
dragboran
weapon
said
underwood
fiercely
the
course
was
changed
so
that
the
flight
of
the
paralleled
that
of
the
terrestrian
fleet
the
acceleration
was
increased
to
a
twenty
per
cent
overload
of
the
inertia
units
making
it
necessary
for
each
man
to
use
a
small
carrier
unit
against
his
own
increased
weight
still
the
fleet
crept
up
lessening
the
distance
between
them
but
underwood
felt
confident
that
the
distance
between
their
parallel
courses
was
great
enough
to
prevent
detection
by
any
means
the
fleet
could
mount
there
was
new
life
in
the
ship
as
the
working
and
sleeping
periods
passed
rapidly
it
was
easier
to
concentrate
on
their
work
now
that
everyone
felt
he
was
heading
toward
a
definite
goal
they
dared
not
doubt
that
that
goal
would
yield
what
they
hoped
from
it
under
phyfe
direction
daily
classes
in
sirenian
culture
were
held
every
fact
of
existence
they
tried
to
view
from
the
sirenian
viewpoint
and
anticipate
its
semantic
significance
to
that
ancient
conquering
race
the
trip
was
estimated
at
approximately
three
months
a
little
impromptu
party
was
held
when
the
fleet
passed
them
near
the
halfway
mark
from
then
on
it
was
a
desperate
race
to
see
that
the
other
ships
did
get
out
of
range
of
the
instruments
of
the
in
the
last
week
of
the
third
month
a
sudden
sharp
deceleration
was
observed
in
the
ships
of
the
battle
fleet
underwood
alerted
his
entire
crew
if
their
deductions
had
been
right
they
were
within
a
few
hundred
thousand
light
years
of
the
dragboran
world
as
the
braked
some
of
its
tremendous
velocity
by
the
opening
of
the
entropy
dissipators
the
fleet
appeared
heading
for
a
small
galaxy
with
a
group
of
yellow
stars
near
its
outer
rim
underwood
allowed
their
ship
to
close
somewhat
the
enormous
gap
between
them
and
the
enemy
but
he
wanted
to
maintain
a
reasonable
distance
for
the
fleet
would
certainly
begin
to
the
skies
of
the
alien
planet
when
they
arrived
and
found
the
had
not
landed
the
fleet
was
finally
observed
to
close
in
upon
one
of
the
yellow
suns
which
had
a
system
of
five
planets
it
was
the
fourth
planet
toward
which
the
fleet
drove
underwood
watched
six
of
the
twenty
ships
land
upon
it
let
line
up
behind
one
of
the
other
planets
he
instructed
dawson
the
second
appears
closest
then
we
can
swing
over
and
come
in
behind
the
moon
of
number
four
we
probably
land
on
that
moon
and
look
the
fleet
over
before
deciding
our
next
action
the
only
disadvantage
in
the
maneuver
was
that
they
could
not
keep
a
sufficiently
close
check
on
the
fleet
they
came
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
planet
for
two
hours
and
then
were
eclipsed
by
the
moon
of
the
fourth
planet
during
that
interval
they
were
in
the
light
of
the
sun
and
they
saw
no
evidence
of
the
fleet
at
all
the
photographers
busied
themselves
with
taking
pictures
of
the
dragboran
world
like
the
second
planet
the
moon
appeared
to
be
a
barren
sphere
at
first
glance
but
as
they
approached
and
moved
farther
around
its
circumference
they
found
an
area
of
lush
vegetation
occupying
about
an
eighth
of
the
surface
it
was
the
night
side
at
the
moment
of
their
approach
no
sign
of
habitation
was
apparent
though
underwood
thought
for
an
instant
he
glimpsed
a
smoke
column
spiraling
upward
in
the
night
as
they
dropped
to
the
surface
then
it
was
gone
and
he
was
not
sure
that
he
had
really
seen
anything
the
came
to
rest
on
the
grassy
floor
of
a
clearing
in
the
vegetated
corner
of
the
otherwise
barren
world
at
that
instant
mason
came
into
the
control
room
i
do
know
what
you
expect
to
find
on
that
planet
down
there
he
said
he
handed
a
batch
of
photos
to
underwood
we
must
have
pulled
a
boner
somewhere
underwood
felt
a
sting
of
apprehension
why
what
the
matter
if
there
any
habitation
there
it
under
bottles
there
is
a
speck
of
atmosphere
on
the
whole
planet
that
makes
it
definitely
an
archeological
problem
then
phyfe
said
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
an
advanced
civilization
like
the
dragboran
could
have
existed
another
half
million
years
but
the
photos
what
do
they
show
he
glanced
over
underwood
arm
there
are
cities
no
question
that
the
planet
was
once
inhabited
but
it
looks
as
if
it
had
only
been
yesterday
that
those
cities
had
been
occupied
that
would
be
explained
by
the
absence
of
atmosphere
said
underwood
the
cities
would
not
be
buried
under
drifted
mounds
in
an
airless
world
some
great
cataclysm
must
have
removed
both
atmosphere
and
life
from
the
planet
at
the
same
time
perhaps
our
problem
is
easier
rather
than
more
difficult
because
of
this
if
the
destruction
occurred
reasonably
soon
after
the
dragbora
defeated
the
sirenians
there
may
be
ample
evidence
of
their
weapons
among
the
ruins
as
dreyer
terry
and
illia
drifted
into
the
control
room
after
the
landing
an
impromptu
war
council
was
held
we
have
to
wait
until
the
fleet
gives
up
and
goes
back
said
terry
we
ca
hope
to
go
in
and
blast
them
out
of
the
way
how
do
we
know
they
give
up
asked
illia
they
may
be
a
permanent
guard
we
do
know
what
they
will
do
said
underwood
they
might
stay
for
months
anyway
and
that
is
too
long
for
us
to
wait
even
twenty
ships
are
not
a
large
force
on
a
planet
of
that
size
my
plan
is
to
make
a
night
landing
in
some
barren
area
then
advance
slowly
up
to
one
of
the
larger
cities
and
hide
the
ship
we
can
make
explorations
by
means
of
scooter
to
determine
if
any
of
the
fleet
is
in
the
city
if
so
we
can
move
on
if
not
we
can
begin
searching
it
makes
no
difference
where
we
begin
until
we
get
some
kind
of
idea
of
the
history
and
culture
of
the
dragbora
it
so
hopeless
phyfe
shook
his
head
fiercely
it
would
be
a
project
for
a
thousand
archeologists
for
a
hundred
years
to
examine
and
analyze
such
ruins
as
those
down
there
yet
a
hundred
of
us
propose
to
do
it
in
weeks
hiding
from
a
deadly
enemy
at
the
same
time
utterly
impossible
i
do
think
so
said
underwood
we
are
searching
only
for
one
thing
we
know
it
is
a
weapon
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
believe
there
might
be
wide
reference
to
it
in
the
writings
and
history
of
the
dragbora
since
it
was
the
means
of
destroying
their
rival
empire
the
only
real
difficulty
is
with
the
fleet
but
i
think
we
can
work
under
their
noses
for
a
long
enough
time
you
an
incurable
optimist
said
terry
so
are
the
rest
of
you
or
you
never
have
come
on
this
trip
i
agreeable
said
illia
there
only
one
thing
i
like
to
suggest
if
this
moon
is
at
all
habitable
i
think
we
should
take
a
day
or
two
off
and
stretch
our
legs
outside
in
some
sunshine
there
was
no
objection
to
that
dawn
on
the
moon
of
the
dragboran
world
almost
corresponded
with
the
end
of
their
sleeping
period
analysis
was
made
of
conditions
outside
the
atmosphere
proved
suitable
though
thin
the
outside
temperature
appeared
high
as
was
expected
from
their
proximity
to
the
sun
then
as
underwood
ordered
the
force
shell
lifted
and
opened
the
port
he
received
a
shock
of
surprise
that
made
him
exclaim
aloud
illia
not
far
behind
came
running
what
is
it
del
his
finger
was
pointing
down
toward
a
group
of
figures
at
the
base
of
the
ship
they
were
quite
human
in
appearance
in
the
same
way
that
demarzule
had
been
taller
than
the
earthmen
and
they
watched
the
opening
of
the
port
and
bowed
low
before
underwood
and
illia
there
were
four
of
them
standing
and
they
were
grouped
about
a
fifth
figure
lying
on
a
litter
maybe
we
ought
to
forget
about
leaving
the
ship
said
underwood
doubtfully
there
no
use
getting
tangled
up
with
superstitious
natives
we
have
time
for
that
no
wait
del
that
one
on
the
litter
is
hurt
said
illia
i
believe
they
brought
him
here
to
see
us
maybe
we
can
do
something
for
him
underwood
knew
it
was
no
use
trying
to
oppose
her
desire
to
help
he
said
let
get
dreyer
he
may
be
able
to
talk
with
them
dreyer
and
phyfe
and
nichols
were
already
coming
toward
the
port
together
they
were
excited
by
underwood
report
this
may
be
an
offshoot
of
either
the
dragboran
or
sirenian
civilization
said
phyfe
in
either
case
we
may
find
something
useful
to
us
they
think
we
gods
they
want
us
to
cure
one
of
their
injured
said
underwood
we
ca
hope
for
anything
useful
in
a
society
as
primitive
as
that
the
semanticists
looked
out
at
the
small
group
suddenly
dreyer
uttered
sounds
that
resembled
a
series
of
grunts
with
changing
inflections
one
of
the
natives
a
woman
rose
and
presented
a
long
speech
wholly
meaningless
to
underwood
but
dreyer
stood
with
strained
attention
as
if
comprehending
with
difficulty
every
meaning
in
that
alien
tongue
then
underwood
recalled
hearing
of
dreyer
statement
that
a
true
semanticist
should
be
able
to
understand
and
converse
in
any
alien
language
the
first
time
he
heard
it
in
all
languages
there
are
sounds
and
intonations
that
have
fundamental
and
identical
semantic
content
these
dreyer
asserted
could
be
identified
and
used
in
reconstructing
the
language
in
a
ready
flow
of
conversation
if
one
were
skillful
enough
underwood
had
always
believed
it
was
nothing
but
a
boast
but
now
he
was
seeing
it
in
action
the
two
women
of
the
group
and
one
of
the
men
seemed
utterly
lost
in
their
attitude
of
worship
but
the
other
figure
standing
a
little
apart
seemed
almost
rebellious
in
appearance
he
spoke
abruptly
and
at
little
length
that
fellow
is
a
healthy
skeptic
said
dreyer
he
willing
to
accept
us
as
gods
but
he
wants
proof
that
we
are
he
liable
to
play
tricks
to
find
out
we
ca
bother
with
them
said
underwood
there
nothing
here
for
us
there
may
be
said
dreyer
we
should
let
illia
see
what
she
can
do
underwood
did
not
press
his
protests
he
allowed
dreyer
to
direct
the
natives
to
bring
their
companion
into
the
ship
there
in
the
surgery
illia
examined
the
injuries
the
injured
one
appeared
aged
but
there
was
a
quality
of
joyousness
and
exuberance
in
his
countenance
that
underwood
found
himself
almost
envying
but
illia
was
shaking
her
head
it
hopeless
she
said
nothing
we
can
do
for
him
she
turned
on
the
fluoroscope
for
underwood
to
see
he
moved
it
about
then
exclaimed
illia
those
strange
organs
below
the
diaphragm
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
the
same
as
in
demarzule
these
must
be
of
the
same
race
dreyer
was
speaking
to
the
companions
of
the
injured
one
explaining
that
it
was
impossible
to
save
the
life
of
the
aged
man
the
response
of
the
rebellious
one
was
an
almost
savage
growl
in
his
throat
he
spoke
then
more
softly
to
the
injured
one
as
if
explaining
the
serene
countenance
did
not
change
but
the
eyes
closed
quietly
and
the
earthmen
knew
that
he
was
dead
swiftly
the
rebellious
one
drew
a
knife
of
glass
from
a
sheath
and
slashed
with
careless
skill
at
the
corpse
he
extracted
one
of
the
alien
organs
and
placed
it
in
a
container
which
he
carried
with
no
other
word
he
left
and
the
two
women
followed
sorrowfully
and
more
slowly
they
refused
to
speak
further
underwood
watched
them
go
we
seem
to
have
gained
a
corpse
he
said
get
a
couple
of
the
men
to
take
it
out
and
bury
it
will
you
terry
i
wonder
what
the
whole
thing
means
anyway
are
these
remnants
of
sirenian
culture
his
speculations
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
blaring
of
the
interphone
doctor
underwood
lookout
reports
entire
terrestrian
fleet
departing
from
the
dragboran
planet
the
group
in
surgery
looked
at
each
other
in
sudden
silence
it
does
make
sense
terry
said
finally
it
does
said
underwood
slowly
if
they
have
found
and
destroyed
what
we
hoped
to
find
also
if
they
wanted
to
draw
us
out
of
hiding
added
dreyer
we
better
wait
a
couple
of
days
and
see
what
they
do
if
they
seem
to
be
intent
on
continuing
their
flight
we
can
move
to
the
planet
with
the
sun
behind
us
and
they
wo
detect
it
but
i
think
that
we
should
wait
the
two
days
at
least
so
if
one
wants
to
do
any
looking
around
on
this
moon
there
his
chance
terry
was
enthusiastic
about
exploring
the
moon
it
seemed
that
here
might
be
a
living
fragment
of
a
civilization
thousands
of
years
old
which
should
have
been
long
dead
in
the
normal
course
of
events
but
which
had
somehow
survived
the
catastrophes
that
wiped
out
the
parent
civilizations
illia
too
was
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
ship
together
they
persuaded
underwood
to
join
them
in
a
scooter
exploration
of
the
surrounding
territory
phyfe
and
dreyer
were
going
but
it
was
necessary
for
mason
to
remain
in
technical
command
at
the
ship
beyond
the
grassy
plain
lay
a
thickly
forested
section
the
scooter
party
rose
high
into
the
air
to
clear
the
wooded
area
and
were
lost
to
the
view
of
those
aboard
the
for
a
long
time
they
rode
at
treetop
level
looking
beyond
toward
the
barren
sand
wastes
that
touched
the
far
horizon
suddenly
terry
pointed
downward
a
road
a
shimmering
belt
ran
through
the
forest
almost
at
right
angles
to
their
line
of
flight
they
dropped
into
the
sylvan
canyon
to
examine
it
underwood
halted
just
above
the
surface
then
he
leaned
over
and
touched
it
dreyer
looked
at
his
puzzled
face
without
halting
the
column
of
cigar
smoke
glass
eh
looks
and
feels
like
it
but
a
glass
highway
limitation
of
materials
said
dreyer
the
moon
obviously
is
lacking
in
mineral
resources
being
composed
chiefly
of
nonmetallic
silicates
the
glass
knife
our
friend
used
on
the
corpse
indicates
metal
starvation
this
highway
clinches
it
because
it
shows
they
have
a
highly
developed
technology
of
therefore
we
are
very
definitely
not
in
the
presence
of
a
primitive
civilization
as
we
supposed
we
better
watch
our
step
because
our
friend
seemed
disillusioned
about
our
failure
to
save
his
injured
companion
they
chose
a
direction
along
the
highway
and
pursued
it
a
few
feet
above
the
surface
they
traveled
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
with
no
break
in
the
forest
about
them
or
the
shining
highway
below
then
abruptly
a
figure
came
into
view
in
the
distance
it
was
moving
rapidly
terry
squinted
and
suddenly
exclaimed
we
come
how
many
light
years
to
find
a
and
we
find
bike
riders
phyfe
said
i
do
see
anything
strange
in
it
certainly
the
bicycle
is
an
obvious
mode
of
locomotion
in
a
moderately
mechanical
culture
it
may
or
may
not
imply
a
lack
of
mechanisms
recognize
that
fellow
asked
underwood
they
drifted
forward
as
the
rider
approached
rapidly
finally
they
could
see
his
features
plainly
and
recognized
him
as
the
rebellious
one
of
their
morning
encounter
i
wonder
if
he
is
on
his
way
back
to
see
us
again
said
terry
our
meeting
is
fortunate
said
dreyer
i
want
to
know
what
he
did
with
that
organ
he
removed
from
the
corpse
i
never
come
across
anything
quite
like
that
in
all
my
ethnological
studies
i
suspect
it
may
be
some
rite
associated
with
the
belief
in
that
organ
as
the
seat
of
life
just
as
the
heart
was
once
regarded
among
us
they
slowed
as
they
came
to
the
man
for
so
they
had
come
to
think
of
him
in
their
own
minds
he
halted
also
and
regarded
them
balefully
then
furious
speech
came
to
his
lips
na
jourli
dreyer
frowned
and
muttered
a
few
syllables
slowly
the
stranger
repeated
the
furious
assertion
he
says
that
we
are
not
gods
said
dreyer
we
could
have
told
him
that
much
said
underwood
drily
the
conversation
in
the
unknown
tongue
continued
until
dreyer
turned
again
to
his
companions
the
fellow
calls
himself
jandro
and
the
fact
that
we
have
metals
still
does
convince
him
that
we
are
gods
an
opinion
which
contradicts
those
of
his
fellows
does
that
make
sense
to
you
phyfe
exclaimed
it
makes
wonderful
sense
a
planet
devoid
of
metals
yet
inhabited
by
a
highly
intelligent
race
they
make
the
best
possible
technological
use
of
materials
at
their
command
but
they
know
somehow
of
the
existence
and
properties
of
metals
what
is
more
natural
than
for
them
to
build
a
religion
about
the
more
fortunate
gods
dreyer
said
to
jandro
we
are
not
gods
we
did
not
come
to
you
as
gods
but
as
visitors
we
are
from
a
place
called
earth
the
admission
seemed
a
great
shock
to
jandro
for
his
expression
changed
markedly
i
am
sorry
he
said
if
i
have
accused
you
of
a
claim
you
have
not
made
but
i
do
not
understand
what
you
say
if
you
come
from
the
heaven
world
take
me
there
and
help
me
return
with
the
secrets
to
lift
my
people
heaven
world
dreyer
frowned
jandro
pointed
toward
the
horizon
where
the
planet
of
the
dragbora
hung
like
a
silver
disk
why
do
you
call
it
heaven
world
jandro
looked
up
with
both
longing
and
bitterness
before
he
spoke
you
did
not
come
from
there
no
but
you
can
go
there
in
your
metal
yes
will
you
take
me
that
is
not
for
me
to
say
but
perhaps
i
can
influence
the
others
tell
me
why
you
want
to
go
and
why
you
call
it
heaven
world
long
ago
said
jandro
before
men
lived
on
trear
they
lived
with
the
gods
on
heaven
world
but
for
rebellion
and
disobedience
they
were
thrown
down
and
exiled
trear
was
a
barren
moon
without
life
or
materials
after
many
man
succeeded
in
expanding
the
tiny
seeds
of
life
he
had
brought
and
grew
the
great
forests
that
gave
us
wood
and
the
deserts
gave
us
glass
so
we
have
built
a
world
on
the
barren
trear
and
have
looked
to
the
time
when
the
gods
shall
lift
us
again
to
heaven
world
that
is
the
story
the
fathers
have
told
but
i
do
not
believe
it
jandro
finished
i
do
not
know
what
to
believe
except
that
i
want
the
heritage
of
our
home
world
to
be
restored
to
us
dreyer
related
the
story
to
his
companions
it
sounds
very
much
as
if
jandro
ancestors
were
some
refugee
group
that
fled
the
planet
before
the
destruction
that
consumed
the
atmosphere
so
he
wants
to
go
with
us
underwood
said
i
wonder
if
he
could
be
of
any
use
to
us
in
unraveling
the
secrets
of
the
planet
i
like
to
use
the
request
to
bargain
with
him
said
dreyer
i
very
much
want
to
know
why
he
cut
out
that
organ
and
what
he
did
with
it
that
surgical
skill
he
exhibited
did
come
instinctively
it
all
right
with
me
assented
underwood
dreyer
addressed
jandro
again
it
is
that
you
may
go
to
the
planet
with
us
there
only
one
thing
we
like
in
return
information
as
to
why
you
opened
the
corpse
and
removed
the
organ
for
the
of
course
oh
you
mean
you
wish
to
present
the
apologetics
sudden
expressions
of
understanding
and
of
extreme
puzzlement
conflicted
on
his
face
dreyer
fumbled
an
instant
the
apologetics
yes
of
course
we
wish
to
present
the
apologetics
very
well
you
are
guests
of
my
house
my
father
will
be
pleased
jandro
wheeled
his
bicycle
about
and
sped
down
the
road
dreyer
told
the
others
what
had
happened
and
set
his
scooter
in
motion
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
stranger
terry
was
explosive
in
comment
what
the
devil
are
the
apologetics
he
demanded
we
do
know
how
to
offer
them
or
who
to
offer
them
to
you
going
to
get
us
in
a
jam
if
we
poke
into
the
religious
rites
of
these
amateur
surgeons
underwood
speculated
about
dreyer
behind
the
passive
exterior
of
the
man
was
a
brain
whose
incessant
activity
often
flowed
in
the
most
devious
channels
what
motivated
this
interest
in
the
peculiarities
of
the
alien
culture
underwood
was
sure
there
was
more
than
appeared
on
the
surface
there
was
the
fact
that
every
organ
presents
a
vulnerable
point
to
the
proper
weapon
was
it
dreyer
idea
to
determine
the
properties
of
the
unknown
organs
in
the
hope
of
finding
weapons
to
which
they
would
be
vulnerable
the
forest
gave
way
to
green
and
they
were
in
a
clearing
that
shone
in
the
sunlight
like
a
pool
of
soap
bubbles
the
houses
like
the
streets
were
of
multicolored
glass
that
sparkled
as
if
with
light
of
their
own
the
earthmen
knew
then
for
certain
that
they
were
not
in
the
presence
of
any
primitive
people
for
the
city
was
arranged
with
the
artistry
of
a
giant
crown
of
jewels
there
were
many
of
the
tall
copper
people
in
the
streets
and
in
the
parkways
seeing
them
together
in
their
own
setting
underwood
was
impressed
with
their
grace
and
simple
beauty
serenity
and
contentment
were
in
their
features
and
in
the
grace
of
their
carriage
the
earthmen
astride
the
scooters
riding
mysteriously
above
the
surface
of
the
road
soon
attracted
attention
cries
rose
into
the
air
and
scores
of
the
people
prostrated
themselves
in
the
road
jandro
stopped
and
motioned
the
men
to
halt
then
he
addressed
his
people
in
speech
that
was
too
rapid
even
for
dreyer
understanding
dreyer
managed
to
glean
only
that
jandro
was
saying
the
men
had
come
to
offer
the
apologetics
to
his
father
and
that
jandro
had
been
chosen
to
go
to
heaven
world
for
his
people
there
were
some
who
seemed
to
regard
jandro
with
astonished
disbelief
and
others
who
bowed
before
him
as
before
the
earthmen
but
when
the
group
began
moving
forward
again
the
people
rose
and
stood
in
silence
and
awe
they
stopped
before
a
large
cube
of
orange
hue
jandro
dismounted
and
stood
aside
for
them
to
enter
you
do
my
house
honor
he
said
underwood
strained
to
pick
up
some
of
the
language
but
he
could
only
guess
at
it
phyfe
and
terry
bernard
were
getting
much
of
it
but
not
with
dreyer
facility
the
semanticist
walked
toward
the
building
confidently
then
stopped
at
the
entrance
and
regarded
his
cigar
doubtfully
it
was
impossible
to
toss
it
aside
upon
the
immaculate
gardens
or
walkways
he
finally
put
it
out
against
his
shoe
and
stuffed
the
shredded
remains
in
his
pocket
the
interior
of
the
house
was
fitted
with
simple
luxury
abundant
light
streamed
from
colored
prisms
which
brought
in
flooding
beams
of
natural
light
from
outside
the
decoratively
translucent
panels
that
formed
the
walls
almost
at
once
two
others
women
entered
from
the
opposite
doorway
into
the
room
one
was
elderly
but
the
other
was
younger
than
jandro
in
appearance
then
the
earthmen
recognized
them
the
same
who
had
been
at
the
ship
with
jandro
that
morning
they
gave
involuntary
cries
at
the
sight
of
the
earthmen
quickly
jandro
explained
their
presence
and
their
denial
of
being
gods
gradually
the
excitement
of
the
two
women
abated
and
jandro
introduced
them
to
dreyer
who
relayed
the
introductions
they
will
prepare
our
meal
before
we
go
said
jandro
but
now
you
wish
you
view
my
father
and
offer
the
apologetics
come
this
way
he
led
the
way
through
the
house
to
another
room
with
a
closed
door
even
dreyer
calm
was
deserting
him
as
he
wondered
what
would
happen
if
he
could
not
grasp
instantly
what
was
expected
of
him
jandro
suddenly
flung
the
door
wide
and
ushered
them
in
you
will
wish
to
be
alone
he
said
i
will
await
you
he
closed
the
door
none
of
them
had
any
preconceived
idea
of
what
they
might
see
nor
could
they
have
imagined
the
sight
that
met
their
eyes
the
room
was
large
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
from
floor
to
ceiling
like
a
fantastic
library
it
was
the
objects
on
those
shelves
that
held
their
attention
square
glass
jars
completely
identical
filled
the
spaces
and
in
each
jar
was
a
organ
exactly
like
that
taken
from
the
corpse
aboard
their
ship
by
jandro
a
clear
transparent
preservative
liquid
surrounded
the
specimens
and
the
containers
were
sealed
but
in
a
small
space
before
them
a
table
stood
and
on
it
rested
a
single
jar
with
a
specimen
instinctively
they
knew
it
was
the
one
they
had
seen
excised
that
morning
terry
expelled
a
lungful
of
air
well
this
something
a
morgue
for
extinct
livers
kept
by
an
amateur
surgeon
who
rides
a
bike
to
work
what
the
devil
do
you
make
of
it
illia
was
examining
the
specimens
closely
all
of
them
were
as
good
surgeons
as
jandro
most
of
these
look
as
if
they
been
out
with
a
meat
axe
some
of
them
look
as
if
they
been
here
since
the
beginning
of
time
some
sort
of
ancestor
worship
said
underwood
the
apologetics
must
be
some
form
of
social
rite
offered
to
the
ancestors
of
a
friend
all
of
it
interesting
but
quite
useless
for
our
purposes
at
the
moment
it
not
that
simple
said
the
semanticist
consider
the
fact
that
even
though
jandro
understands
we
are
from
another
world
he
believes
us
familiar
with
all
of
this
he
therefore
believes
these
things
familiar
to
all
humanoid
beings
there
could
be
a
scientifically
valid
reason
behind
it
what
said
underwood
i
do
know
but
i
going
to
find
out
jandro
was
waiting
for
them
when
they
emerged
he
showed
them
to
the
table
where
a
meal
was
prepared
and
waiting
for
underwood
and
illia
it
was
a
strange
meal
for
they
could
not
communicate
with
their
hosts
in
the
slightest
degree
phyfe
and
terry
were
entering
gradually
into
the
interchange
there
was
awkwardness
due
to
the
oversize
furniture
and
eating
equipment
but
tolerant
allowances
were
made
on
both
sides
the
two
women
had
difficulty
in
dropping
their
stiff
reserve
but
by
the
end
of
the
meal
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
the
men
were
anything
but
old
acquaintances
in
for
a
visit
it
was
then
that
jandro
said
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
see
our
and
the
installation
of
the
without
a
sign
of
incomprehension
dreyer
repeated
the
question
i
willing
to
see
anything
there
is
to
see
said
underwood
though
he
was
restless
he
knew
they
must
give
more
time
for
the
terrestrian
fleet
to
get
away
they
left
the
house
and
crossed
the
city
afoot
jandro
leading
the
way
toward
one
of
the
major
jewels
in
that
sparkling
city
it
was
a
large
building
of
glass
standing
apart
from
other
structures
i
should
have
explained
said
jandro
this
is
where
my
duties
are
performed
i
am
an
installer
today
i
am
not
working
but
operations
are
being
performed
so
that
you
will
be
able
to
witness
our
methods
as
well
as
the
of
the
he
led
them
through
the
winding
corridors
of
the
magnificent
structure
of
glass
by
some
means
underwood
observed
the
glistening
floors
had
a
high
friction
without
losing
any
of
their
sheen
abruptly
they
came
into
a
chamber
that
formed
a
small
amphitheater
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
operating
amphitheaters
of
terrestrian
hospitals
with
something
of
a
shock
they
discovered
that
was
exactly
what
it
was
they
took
seats
by
the
protective
railing
below
them
on
a
table
where
a
pair
of
surgeons
worked
an
infant
lay
with
a
large
abdominal
incision
one
of
the
surgeons
lifted
a
small
fleshy
object
from
a
nearby
bath
and
skillfully
inserted
it
through
the
incision
they
watched
in
amazement
as
the
organ
was
sutured
into
place
tiny
blood
vessels
were
spliced
and
nerves
from
adjacent
organs
were
slit
and
led
into
the
new
mass
illia
clutched
underwood
arm
she
whispered
they
in
those
strange
organs
we
have
identified
they
are
born
with
them
at
all
but
where
do
they
get
them
terry
muttered
maybe
that
why
they
take
them
out
after
death
to
use
them
over
again
but
that
be
because
they
pickle
them
i
give
up
this
is
too
much
for
me
illia
eyes
were
only
for
the
skilled
hands
below
that
were
working
such
miracles
with
living
tissue
once
she
looked
aside
at
the
calm
features
of
jandro
and
recalled
his
passing
remark
that
he
was
an
installer
if
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
did
he
could
stand
with
the
greatest
of
earth
surgeons
the
operation
was
a
long
one
when
the
two
surgeons
finally
closed
the
incision
they
began
a
similar
operation
at
the
base
of
the
brain
grafting
in
a
fragment
of
shapeless
flesh
there
the
earthmen
could
not
comprehend
how
the
infant
could
stand
the
shock
of
such
radical
surgery
yet
if
they
were
to
believe
the
evidence
this
was
performed
on
every
child
born
on
the
moon
jandro
said
you
have
seen
our
technique
how
does
it
compare
with
yours
dreyer
nodded
noncommittally
very
similar
except
that
we
have
found
it
advisable
to
delay
the
brain
operation
it
relieves
shock
and
appears
to
help
recovery
the
you
mean
so
that
is
the
explanation
i
will
be
frank
i
been
attempting
to
detect
your
since
your
arrival
i
have
wondered
about
your
reasons
for
concealment
but
of
course
that
is
your
own
concern
it
seemed
impossible
however
that
you
should
prevent
me
from
detecting
yes
dreyer
replied
sagely
he
reported
the
double
talk
to
his
companions
i
do
think
we
can
keep
this
up
much
longer
and
i
believe
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
disclose
our
lack
of
these
organs
jandro
assumes
all
humanoid
life
requires
it
he
would
be
likely
to
consider
us
if
he
knew
underwood
nodded
tell
him
we
be
on
our
way
then
it
had
been
fruitless
he
thought
he
did
know
what
dreyer
had
expected
of
their
diversionary
visit
among
these
people
but
as
far
as
underwood
could
see
it
had
accomplished
nothing
he
had
become
rather
attracted
to
jandro
however
in
their
few
hours
together
recognizing
in
him
something
of
the
same
rebellion
against
the
conventions
of
his
world
that
underwood
felt
on
earth
perhaps
on
the
trip
to
the
dragboran
planet
they
could
become
acquainted
jandro
led
them
from
the
chamber
you
must
see
the
it
will
only
take
a
few
moments
it
has
never
once
died
and
now
is
far
older
than
our
historical
records
the
earthmen
followed
through
the
winding
corridors
again
to
a
door
that
opened
only
after
a
complicated
code
system
and
then
by
being
drawn
wholly
inward
as
they
walked
through
the
opening
they
observed
the
walls
were
nearly
four
feet
thick
of
solid
glass
of
a
hue
the
protection
is
necessary
to
guard
the
against
natural
disturbances
and
the
occasional
unfortunates
among
us
whose
will
is
to
destroy
no
force
of
which
we
are
aware
could
penetrate
the
barrier
underwood
interest
was
aroused
concerning
the
nature
of
this
mysterious
he
suspected
the
meaning
of
the
name
but
the
nature
of
the
substance
was
impossible
to
guess
at
the
room
into
which
they
came
was
very
large
and
equipped
as
a
laboratory
with
wooden
and
glass
instruments
on
every
side
the
central
feature
of
the
room
however
was
a
large
container
about
twenty
feet
in
diameter
inside
it
rising
about
halfway
to
the
top
was
a
shapeless
mass
of
flesh
grayish
for
the
most
part
but
shot
through
with
livid
streaks
of
red
it
pulsed
as
if
some
quiescent
sleeping
life
possessed
it
this
is
our
said
jandro
illia
shuddered
faintly
at
the
sight
it
looks
almost
like
an
enormous
cancer
she
said
they
peered
into
the
vat
the
base
of
the
mound
of
flesh
being
hidden
by
a
thick
soupy
liquid
a
technician
approached
as
they
neared
the
dome
he
carried
a
instrument
which
he
had
just
removed
from
a
sterilizer
as
they
watched
he
opened
a
port
in
the
dome
and
thrust
the
instrument
quickly
into
the
mound
of
flesh
and
turned
it
the
mass
quivered
and
recoiled
but
the
instrument
withdrew
holding
a
core
from
deep
within
the
mass
slowly
the
wound
closed
and
the
thick
dark
blood
ceased
flowing
the
technician
dropped
the
core
into
a
container
and
carried
it
across
the
room
to
one
of
several
hundred
cagelike
units
about
a
foot
square
there
you
see
it
said
jandro
the
primeval
flesh
is
cut
out
and
placed
within
its
forming
box
where
surgical
manipulation
and
radiation
will
cause
the
formation
of
the
specialized
cells
that
will
turn
it
into
one
of
the
three
i
swear
that
is
cancerous
tissue
said
illia
whatever
the
purpose
of
these
strange
organs
developed
from
it
it
may
be
that
these
people
have
succeeded
in
perfecting
the
mutation
that
nature
has
been
struggling
with
on
earth
for
thousands
of
generations
but
what
could
be
the
purpose
of
it
underwood
demanded
what
abilities
do
these
organs
give
that
we
do
not
already
possess
i
see
any
evidence
in
jandro
nor
did
i
see
any
in
demarzule
showing
the
results
of
these
organs
who
knows
said
dreyer
but
i
believe
illia
may
be
right
among
us
cancerous
formation
has
all
the
appearance
of
a
mutation
gone
wild
yet
it
seems
to
be
one
that
nature
insists
on
perhaps
with
jandro
aboard
the
ship
we
can
find
out
what
these
organs
do
they
returned
to
jandro
house
there
jandro
bade
to
his
mother
and
his
sister
they
seemed
curiously
unmoved
by
what
must
be
an
event
of
tremendous
significance
in
their
history
underwood
thought
jandro
mounted
behind
underwood
on
the
scooter
they
rose
high
in
the
air
and
set
a
straight
course
for
the
spot
where
the
lay
jandro
gave
no
outward
sign
that
such
flight
was
unusual
for
him
within
a
few
minutes
they
spotted
the
ship
and
groups
of
the
crew
gathered
outside
some
at
a
distance
of
a
mile
or
two
they
circled
and
landed
returned
the
scooters
to
the
locks
mason
came
up
as
if
greatly
relieved
to
see
them
the
men
are
anxious
to
be
on
the
way
he
said
the
fleet
of
demarzule
is
definitely
returning
to
earth
even
more
rapidly
than
they
came
here
there
appears
to
be
no
more
reason
for
delay
underwood
went
to
the
control
room
to
check
the
observations
before
his
eyes
the
mighty
fleet
was
melting
into
the
depths
of
space
toward
earth
he
checked
their
velocity
and
frowned
what
purpose
was
there
in
this
sudden
retreat
did
it
signify
a
trap
that
had
been
prepared
for
the
scientists
on
the
dragboran
planet
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
and
no
way
of
combating
the
unknown
underwood
stood
up
from
the
viewing
plates
and
nodded
let
go
as
if
awaiting
the
completion
of
the
final
step
in
his
long
journey
to
destiny
jandro
watched
the
stars
swing
past
the
field
of
his
vision
as
the
turned
sharply
to
get
into
the
shadow
of
the
planet
to
prevent
observation
by
the
fleet
underwood
watched
the
alien
individual
trying
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
jandro
and
his
people
what
was
the
truth
about
their
myth
of
a
fall
from
heaven
world
which
jandro
admitted
he
did
not
believe
how
had
the
strange
mass
of
flesh
originated
from
which
they
perpetuated
the
unknown
organs
within
their
own
bodies
underwood
wondered
if
illia
were
right
if
it
were
the
harnessing
of
some
cancerous
mutation
that
had
occurred
long
ago
in
some
forgotten
individual
and
perfected
for
the
whole
race
most
important
of
all
could
jandro
and
his
people
have
any
bearing
on
the
problem
that
had
brought
the
scientists
across
the
vastness
of
space
to
underwood
it
seemed
unlikely
they
had
come
in
search
of
a
strange
and
deadly
weapon
hinted
at
only
in
scant
records
half
a
million
years
old
jandro
people
knew
nothing
of
the
vast
techniques
of
producing
metallic
instruments
and
equipment
they
were
wizards
in
glass
technology
and
in
surgery
but
it
was
doubtful
if
they
even
knew
of
the
existence
of
electricity
the
journey
was
only
a
matter
of
hours
from
the
moon
to
the
planet
but
it
seemed
the
longest
part
of
the
trip
to
the
scientists
who
crowded
about
the
scanning
plates
turned
up
to
their
highest
sensitivity
from
a
quarter
of
a
million
miles
away
the
faint
details
of
the
ancient
cities
began
to
be
recognizable
on
the
large
screens
the
sharpness
with
which
they
were
revealed
was
for
the
airless
world
permitted
perfect
clarity
of
vision
and
there
had
been
none
of
the
ceaseless
winds
that
were
quick
to
hide
the
works
of
man
on
other
planets
beneath
dunes
of
sand
here
it
looked
as
if
the
inhabitants
had
made
a
quick
orderly
exodus
only
yesterday
leaving
the
vast
cities
for
whoever
might
want
them
phyfe
was
ecstatic
at
the
sight
the
archeologists
dream
he
said
the
perfect
preservation
of
an
ancient
civilization
i
ca
see
how
the
atmosphere
was
destroyed
without
considerable
effect
all
over
the
planet
said
underwood
it
does
seem
possible
wait
there
it
is
on
the
horizon
of
the
world
appeared
a
vast
scar
that
looked
as
if
it
encompassed
at
least
an
eighth
of
the
planet
surface
it
looked
relatively
shallow
though
they
knew
it
must
be
miles
deep
at
the
center
as
if
a
searing
torch
had
been
touched
at
that
one
spot
in
a
great
blaze
that
consumed
all
the
gases
in
the
planet
atmosphere
for
hundreds
of
miles
around
the
cities
and
plains
showed
evidence
now
of
the
destruction
it
was
only
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
planet
that
the
works
of
the
ancient
inhabitants
had
escaped
that
what
did
it
said
underwood
i
got
an
idea
that
we
find
actually
few
cities
without
considerable
damage
but
this
is
more
than
i
hoped
for
if
there
is
evidence
of
the
weapon
here
we
may
be
able
to
find
it
yet
they
circled
the
planet
out
of
sight
of
the
departing
fleet
taking
scores
of
pictures
of
the
remains
below
for
future
study
at
a
point
farthest
removed
from
the
center
of
destruction
lay
one
of
the
largest
of
the
undamaged
cities
it
was
nearly
five
hundred
square
miles
in
area
and
almost
in
the
center
of
it
was
an
area
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
a
landing
for
ships
there
underwood
ordered
the
brought
down
upon
the
surface
of
the
dragboran
world
under
their
predetermined
plan
phyfe
was
now
given
charge
of
their
archeological
activities
he
had
already
outlined
the
method
of
procedure
they
would
move
outward
in
small
groups
mapping
the
city
as
they
went
their
initial
goals
would
be
libraries
and
laboratories
for
their
first
task
was
to
obtain
command
of
the
dragboran
language
as
jandro
looked
out
upon
the
barren
planet
his
face
displayed
its
first
sign
of
emotion
he
stared
at
the
deserted
ruins
and
his
lips
moved
heaven
world
he
murmured
dreyer
came
up
behind
him
it
was
just
a
world
where
men
lived
he
said
something
happened
a
long
time
ago
that
made
it
unfit
for
your
people
to
live
here
some
few
of
them
apparently
escaped
to
the
moon
and
carried
on
your
civilization
that
is
what
is
behind
your
legends
of
heaven
world
jandro
nodded
slowly
and
it
means
that
we
can
never
possess
our
world
again
i
had
thought
that
i
would
lead
my
people
back
here
be
the
first
to
reclaim
my
heritage
and
there
is
nothing
to
reclaim
forever
we
shall
remain
in
our
barren
moon
of
glass
while
only
the
ghosts
of
the
gods
possess
our
metal
heaven
world
you
do
believe
in
the
gods
and
less
in
their
ghosts
dreyer
reminded
him
bluntly
jandro
remained
facing
the
port
without
speaking
dreyer
continued
your
people
would
never
have
followed
you
here
even
if
the
planet
had
been
all
that
you
dreamed
you
know
that
do
you
jandro
whirled
startled
as
if
dreyer
had
been
reading
his
mind
dreyer
pretended
not
to
notice
in
every
civilization
there
are
those
who
dream
of
better
things
for
themselves
and
their
world
would
it
help
if
i
told
you
that
of
all
the
worlds
and
peoples
that
men
have
found
in
their
wanderings
in
the
void
there
are
none
as
highly
civilized
as
yours
a
world
of
bits
of
glass
a
world
where
the
perfection
of
the
individual
is
the
most
urgent
community
enterprise
but
you
know
all
of
that
let
go
out
and
see
what
your
heaven
world
was
like
when
your
people
lived
here
clad
in
spacesuits
the
earthmen
began
to
pour
out
of
the
ship
phyfe
and
underwood
directed
the
dispersal
of
the
small
exploring
groups
who
were
to
move
radially
in
all
directions
though
few
were
trained
in
the
methods
of
archeology
they
understood
their
objectives
well
enough
to
assist
in
the
preliminary
identification
of
specialized
centers
and
in
gathering
information
one
by
one
the
groups
left
the
scooters
soaring
into
the
sky
like
bees
swarming
from
a
hive
underwood
chose
to
remain
near
the
landing
area
with
phyfe
and
terry
and
dreyer
illia
and
jandro
also
were
part
of
this
group
which
were
to
explore
the
buildings
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
landing
area
underwood
was
curious
about
the
thoughts
passing
through
the
mind
of
the
stranger
as
he
viewed
for
the
first
time
the
remains
of
heaven
world
here
where
there
should
have
been
sunlight
and
gardens
and
life
there
was
only
the
mad
contrast
of
blindingly
bright
planes
and
shadows
of
terrifying
darkness
out
of
which
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
might
suddenly
rise
but
since
stepping
out
of
the
ship
in
the
hastily
modified
suit
that
hardly
accommodated
his
bulk
jandro
face
had
taken
on
a
look
of
inquiry
and
expression
of
expectancy
as
if
waiting
for
the
earthmen
to
do
something
yet
not
quite
understanding
their
delay
underwood
was
impressed
by
this
curious
expectancy
but
there
were
too
many
other
things
to
be
concerned
with
at
the
moment
he
drew
the
attention
of
the
others
toward
an
edifice
that
reared
at
least
two
thousand
feet
into
the
sky
a
mile
beyond
the
landing
area
but
which
was
connected
with
it
by
a
long
road
or
ramp
let
have
a
look
at
that
he
suggested
jandro
opened
his
lips
hesitantly
as
if
to
speak
then
suddenly
closed
them
tightly
and
a
new
and
dreadful
expression
came
upon
his
face
underwood
was
mystified
but
dismissed
the
puzzle
from
his
mind
his
eyes
were
upon
the
great
structure
that
loomed
just
ahead
he
soared
up
around
it
nowhere
were
there
windows
or
other
openings
in
the
heights
of
the
vast
featureless
walls
he
dropped
back
to
ground
level
and
found
his
companions
at
the
edge
of
the
enormous
ramp
leading
down
into
the
depths
beneath
the
building
he
noticed
there
were
only
four
of
them
where
did
jandro
go
terry
glanced
quickly
about
i
thought
he
was
with
you
no
he
probably
went
after
something
that
looked
familiar
to
him
i
guess
he
ca
get
lost
the
ship
is
obvious
enough
out
there
in
the
center
of
the
field
shall
we
see
what
down
here
dreyer
pointed
toward
a
track
leading
from
the
depths
it
possible
this
is
an
underground
hangar
for
their
vessels
perhaps
an
embarkation
station
from
which
the
ships
were
towed
to
the
takeoff
area
underwood
touched
the
controls
of
his
scooter
and
led
the
way
down
the
decline
a
scant
few
feet
above
its
surface
in
the
field
illuminated
by
the
spotlight
of
the
scooter
he
could
see
that
the
opening
at
the
bottom
was
close
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
diameter
the
others
followed
cautiously
down
the
long
slope
at
the
bottom
they
paused
glancing
back
estimating
their
distance
under
the
great
building
above
then
underwood
led
the
way
slowly
forward
into
the
darkness
of
the
ancient
terminal
suddenly
in
the
glare
of
his
light
distant
metallic
facets
reflected
the
gleam
he
went
forward
swiftly
swinging
the
light
about
then
he
realized
they
were
already
in
the
center
of
a
double
row
of
metallic
walls
he
focused
the
light
more
sharply
ships
he
exclaimed
you
were
right
dreyer
they
could
be
anything
else
the
hangar
was
filled
with
row
on
row
of
the
monstrous
vessels
towering
ellipsoidal
shapes
whose
crowns
were
lost
in
the
gloom
that
was
more
desolate
than
the
absolute
darkness
but
the
long
shining
hulls
looked
as
if
ready
for
flight
on
an
instant
notice
the
earthmen
dismounted
from
the
scooters
and
headed
for
the
nearest
ship
eyes
searching
for
a
port
these
are
wonderful
finds
from
an
archeological
standpoint
said
terry
but
they
not
likely
to
contain
our
weapon
because
they
seem
to
be
strictly
commercial
vessels
rather
than
warships
we
ca
know
said
underwood
if
there
was
such
a
state
of
galactic
unrest
as
the
conflict
between
the
sirenians
and
the
dragbora
indicates
it
might
have
been
that
all
commercial
ships
were
armed
is
that
a
hatchway
said
phyfe
pointing
suddenly
upward
underwood
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
beam
from
the
flashlight
as
he
did
so
a
score
of
beams
flashed
upon
them
from
all
parts
of
the
terminal
running
figures
could
be
seen
dimly
in
the
side
reflections
the
earthmen
whirled
about
in
astonishment
and
sudden
fear
they
started
for
the
scooters
on
a
run
then
stopped
short
a
voice
rang
harshly
in
their
ears
halt
and
disarm
in
the
name
of
demarzule
the
great
one
the
enormity
of
their
blunder
broke
upon
them
simultaneously
with
all
its
force
they
had
imagined
every
possible
contingency
except
that
of
a
garrison
left
upon
the
planet
by
the
terrestrian
fleet
once
again
they
had
underestimated
demarzule
underwood
called
suddenly
into
his
microphone
turning
up
the
power
to
reach
the
other
groups
of
explorers
and
those
yet
at
the
ship
underwood
calling
we
attacked
by
demarzule
garrison
defend
a
laugh
cut
him
off
they
would
like
to
defend
no
doubt
but
the
rest
of
them
are
as
helpless
as
you
are
do
you
suppose
that
you
could
outwit
the
mind
of
the
great
one
he
will
be
pleased
to
see
those
who
dared
match
wits
with
him
he
will
be
even
more
pleased
with
his
servants
for
returning
you
underwood
could
not
see
the
speaker
because
the
ring
of
lights
blinded
them
but
now
one
of
the
spacesuited
figures
stepped
forward
into
the
light
of
the
other
lamps
and
gestured
imperiously
back
to
your
ship
he
commanded
we
will
return
to
earth
at
once
as
soon
as
all
of
you
are
rounded
up
do
think
of
escape
we
outnumber
you
ten
to
one
in
this
city
and
those
of
us
who
stood
guard
in
other
places
will
join
us
our
fleet
has
been
notified
already
of
our
success
and
they
will
return
immediately
to
escort
us
back
there
was
no
identifying
the
voice
of
the
speaker
as
other
than
terrestrian
but
there
was
something
in
it
that
none
of
their
semantically
trained
minds
had
ever
heard
before
something
that
chilled
and
terrified
the
sensitive
dreyer
underwood
sensed
it
and
his
mind
struggled
to
evaluate
its
implications
the
voice
was
that
of
one
who
has
seen
a
great
and
mighty
destiny
for
himself
and
his
race
all
the
more
shining
because
unrestricted
by
reality
and
in
that
great
and
illusory
dream
all
creatures
other
than
himself
and
his
chosen
god
sank
into
insignificance
it
was
the
voice
and
the
dream
of
a
madman
none
of
the
others
spoke
but
they
remained
like
diligent
herdsmen
as
the
scientists
were
forced
to
walk
back
up
the
long
incline
leaving
the
scooters
behind
out
on
the
surface
again
they
saw
that
there
were
at
least
two
dozen
of
the
great
one
disciples
indistinguishable
in
space
garb
they
had
planned
with
obvious
care
doubtless
with
maps
provided
by
demarzule
placing
units
of
their
garrison
at
strategic
points
where
the
scientists
would
be
most
likely
to
explore
first
underwood
hoped
that
perhaps
some
of
the
other
groups
had
had
better
luck
than
his
but
it
was
unlikely
for
the
scientists
had
been
totally
unprepared
for
attack
when
the
fleet
had
been
seen
retreating
into
space
they
had
assumed
that
threat
from
that
quarter
had
vanished
with
it
they
marched
slowly
between
the
black
and
shining
planes
of
the
walls
toward
the
and
as
they
moved
they
saw
other
groups
of
the
scientists
being
led
back
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
landing
area
the
ship
had
already
been
taken
over
that
had
been
difficult
underwood
supposed
any
approaching
figures
would
have
been
taken
for
some
of
the
scientists
returning
inside
the
ship
when
the
invaders
burst
from
the
airlocks
weapons
ready
the
scientists
would
have
had
little
chance
underwood
and
his
group
were
led
into
the
lock
and
followed
by
four
of
their
captors
with
readied
weapons
the
scientists
were
ordered
out
of
the
spacesuits
when
the
lock
was
opened
they
were
turned
over
to
others
who
were
waiting
for
them
inside
the
ship
their
original
captors
returned
to
the
outside
underwood
eyes
searched
the
faces
of
those
who
had
taken
over
the
ship
as
if
for
some
sign
of
the
superiority
by
which
the
scientists
had
been
trapped
but
there
was
nothing
in
those
faces
only
the
light
of
fanaticism
shining
dimly
in
the
eyes
underwood
felt
sick
as
he
watched
illia
led
away
to
be
imprisoned
in
her
own
stateroom
the
men
were
herded
together
into
another
room
and
the
sound
of
the
locking
door
was
like
the
final
blow
to
all
their
hopes
for
moments
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
at
last
terry
grinned
bleakly
it
looks
as
if
we
missed
the
boat
this
time
does
it
even
if
we
could
find
the
way
out
of
this
rat
trap
there
are
the
battleships
of
the
fleet
on
their
way
here
sound
came
dimly
from
other
parts
of
the
ship
but
the
men
could
identify
none
of
them
they
supposed
that
the
other
groups
were
being
rounded
up
and
imprisoned
the
whole
thing
had
been
worked
out
as
if
with
foreknowledge
of
their
movements
underwood
wondered
if
demarzule
did
almost
possess
such
powers
he
crossed
to
a
chair
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
sat
down
to
try
to
think
his
thoughts
only
went
around
in
circles
that
seemed
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
until
he
could
concentrate
on
only
the
one
inescapable
fact
of
their
imprisonment
he
wondered
what
was
passing
through
the
minds
of
the
others
phyfe
slumped
upon
a
bunk
seemed
to
have
been
abandoned
by
the
fierce
bright
spirit
that
had
carried
him
along
this
far
in
the
face
of
their
obstacles
terry
was
squirming
restlessly
dreyer
sat
heavily
in
the
opposite
corner
from
underwood
a
cloud
from
his
cigar
almost
obscuring
him
from
view
but
there
were
deep
lines
in
dreyer
forehead
and
his
face
bore
a
fierce
desolation
that
underwood
had
never
seen
there
before
as
though
all
dreyer
own
personal
gods
had
fled
at
once
underwood
knew
that
dreyer
mind
must
be
wrestling
more
with
the
problem
of
responsibility
for
their
failure
rather
than
with
the
problem
of
escape
to
the
semanticist
it
would
be
important
to
determine
whether
the
men
or
their
science
had
failed
he
had
probably
eliminated
the
problem
of
their
escape
by
evaluating
it
as
impossible
while
his
thoughts
revolved
in
endless
procession
underwood
senses
became
more
acutely
aware
of
the
scores
of
sounds
carried
by
the
metallic
walls
and
framework
of
the
ship
he
found
himself
straining
to
identify
and
separate
the
sounds
there
was
one
that
persisted
above
all
the
others
but
it
was
not
the
scrape
of
feet
against
steel
floors
nor
the
bumping
of
closing
and
opening
ports
rather
it
was
the
sound
of
a
voice
so
distant
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
it
tapped
at
the
threshold
of
his
consciousness
for
minutes
before
he
admitted
it
was
more
than
imagination
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
one
after
the
other
of
his
companions
wondering
if
they
had
heard
it
then
for
the
first
time
he
distinguished
words
men
of
earth
the
faint
voice
called
underwood
stood
up
suddenly
terry
jerked
his
head
about
you
heard
it
too
he
asked
underwood
nodded
i
could
have
sworn
someone
was
in
this
room
talking
listen
now
it
getting
louder
while
they
stared
at
each
other
questioningly
there
came
a
sudden
wavering
of
light
in
the
center
of
the
room
they
glanced
at
the
illumination
panel
but
nothing
was
wrong
there
still
the
distortion
of
light
in
their
midst
took
on
vague
shape
it
wavered
and
writhed
as
if
it
were
an
image
on
a
sheet
being
tossed
in
the
wind
then
it
assumed
questionable
solidity
it
was
human
in
form
taller
than
a
man
and
jandro
underwood
exclaimed
the
image
faded
and
wavered
again
how
can
it
be
murmured
phyfe
the
image
was
not
a
thing
of
reality
underwood
knew
it
was
no
more
than
conjuration
within
their
own
brains
yet
the
experience
appeared
identical
to
all
of
them
that
jandro
was
in
some
strange
manner
communicating
with
them
underwood
had
no
doubt
but
the
means
were
utterly
beyond
comprehension
i
do
not
know
whether
you
can
hear
me
or
not
the
voice
of
jandro
spoke
in
their
minds
listen
to
me
if
you
can
i
see
and
hear
you
and
your
actions
indicate
you
are
aware
of
my
presence
i
am
communicating
by
means
of
the
senses
i
know
now
that
you
neither
possess
nor
understand
the
organs
it
had
puzzled
me
that
you
did
not
use
them
what
you
are
or
who
you
are
i
can
not
guess
you
are
not
men
of
course
for
men
can
not
live
without
the
proof
that
you
did
not
possess
it
was
provided
when
you
allowed
yourselves
to
be
trapped
and
captured
i
could
not
understand
it
for
i
perceived
your
enemies
the
instant
your
ship
touched
the
surface
of
the
planet
our
ancient
myths
and
legends
speak
of
creatures
such
as
you
animals
who
could
survive
without
the
but
never
were
they
spoken
of
as
having
the
intelligence
you
display
whatever
you
have
done
you
have
dispelled
our
one
great
legend
not
only
is
metal
not
reserved
for
the
gods
it
is
also
permitted
to
such
creatures
as
you
therefore
i
will
bargain
with
you
i
will
teach
my
people
to
know
and
value
the
ancient
science
and
the
metal
culture
that
they
have
been
denied
you
will
help
me
in
exchange
for
my
help
in
overpowering
your
enemies
are
you
willing
to
do
that
where
are
you
how
can
you
do
this
underwood
demanded
you
can
understand
the
thoughts
that
i
speak
but
i
can
not
understand
your
language
jandro
said
there
only
one
answer
dreyer
said
to
his
companions
is
it
agreeable
to
all
of
us
the
others
nodded
and
dreyer
spoke
quickly
in
jandro
tongue
we
will
do
whatever
is
in
our
power
i
feel
that
you
are
sufficiently
intelligent
to
keep
your
word
said
jandro
when
one
of
your
enemies
next
enters
the
room
i
will
overpower
him
and
you
will
be
free
to
seize
his
weapon
and
to
leave
i
will
be
with
you
later
though
you
do
not
see
me
i
will
visit
the
others
now
the
image
and
the
voice
were
suddenly
gone
and
the
four
men
looked
at
each
other
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
that
they
had
miraculously
shared
so
the
organs
they
graft
in
give
them
telepathic
powers
said
terry
it
funny
he
did
get
wise
to
us
from
the
very
first
when
we
used
spoken
language
all
the
time
or
was
he
reading
our
minds
no
he
was
and
ca
said
phyfe
recall
his
words
that
he
had
to
have
us
speak
in
his
own
language
in
order
for
him
to
receive
communication
from
us
here
it
would
suggest
that
one
faculty
was
used
in
impressing
our
minds
with
his
message
and
another
was
used
in
detecting
our
speech
as
for
our
using
spoken
language
at
first
he
probably
allowed
for
it
because
we
were
strangers
and
gave
us
the
prerogative
of
selecting
our
own
medium
of
communication
do
you
agree
dreyer
the
semanticist
nodded
i
think
we
have
witnessed
at
least
two
separate
functions
of
the
organs
grafted
into
jandro
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
are
about
to
witness
still
another
if
he
is
able
to
keep
his
promise
of
overpowering
the
next
disciple
to
enter
our
room
also
do
not
forget
the
semantic
implications
of
the
to
jandro
he
is
a
man
and
we
are
lower
animals
to
his
way
of
thinking
it
may
not
ever
be
possible
to
alter
that
view
we
should
act
accordingly
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
they
grew
tense
with
expectancy
as
the
sound
of
the
door
lock
clicked
in
the
silence
and
one
of
the
disciples
entered
the
room
he
stood
in
the
doorway
surveying
them
a
man
erect
of
bearing
obviously
a
professional
militarist
he
said
stiffly
in
the
name
of
the
great
one
you
are
ordered
to
appear
before
the
commander
for
questioning
you
will
come
at
a
sudden
glassy
stare
crept
into
his
eyes
and
a
look
of
intolerable
agony
flashed
across
his
face
his
stiffened
arrogant
form
stood
in
utter
lifelessness
then
slowly
it
crashed
to
the
floor
underwood
swept
up
the
gun
that
fell
from
the
loosened
fingers
before
it
hit
the
floor
he
jerked
it
into
firing
position
and
approached
the
open
iris
of
the
doorway
cautiously
the
corridor
was
clear
for
the
moment
you
and
dreyer
remain
here
he
said
to
phyfe
terry
and
i
will
try
to
make
it
to
the
control
room
or
wherever
this
commander
is
keeping
headquarters
if
we
can
capture
him
and
gain
control
of
the
ship
you
should
hear
from
us
within
an
hour
if
not
you
know
we
have
failed
and
then
it
will
be
up
to
you
to
make
a
try
the
older
men
nodded
silently
he
and
terry
slipped
through
the
doorway
the
rest
of
the
iris
doors
on
the
corridor
were
all
closed
underwood
pressed
the
release
lock
on
the
one
adjacent
to
his
own
recent
prison
the
opening
flared
wide
revealing
roberts
one
of
the
surgeons
and
the
three
men
who
had
formed
his
party
underwood
roberts
exclaimed
what
happened
underwood
cautioned
him
to
quiet
and
explained
briefly
locate
some
weapons
if
you
can
there
should
be
some
in
the
corridor
lockers
make
your
way
down
and
release
them
try
to
hold
the
locks
against
the
entry
of
any
more
of
the
disciples
until
we
can
gain
control
inside
the
ship
we
have
no
idea
how
many
are
here
the
men
nodded
exuberant
at
the
opportunity
for
action
against
the
enemy
there
should
be
weapons
in
a
corridor
compartment
only
a
short
distance
toward
the
rear
underwood
knew
ahead
there
was
an
additional
compartment
from
which
he
and
terry
could
reinforce
their
own
armament
the
next
room
they
tried
was
empty
they
thought
at
first
that
the
one
adjacent
to
it
was
also
empty
but
as
they
started
to
move
away
terry
exclaimed
look
there
on
the
floor
one
of
their
men
was
lying
sprawled
the
back
of
his
shirt
covered
with
blood
and
burned
tissue
underwood
and
terry
stepped
in
and
shut
the
iris
door
the
man
looked
up
and
smiled
feebly
as
they
looked
down
at
him
hi
doc
he
said
it
was
armstrong
one
of
the
ship
engineers
what
happened
asked
terry
did
you
try
to
buck
them
the
engineer
answered
painfully
no
it
was
a
sort
of
object
lesson
i
think
the
commander
rennies
they
call
him
gave
me
his
personal
attention
but
have
you
got
the
ship
back
underwood
shook
his
head
we
just
broken
out
and
managed
to
free
a
few
of
the
others
can
you
hang
on
a
while
until
we
can
get
help
yeah
sure
do
worry
about
me
do
you
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
aboard
about
twenty
took
us
over
in
the
beginning
we
were
puzzled
when
we
thought
so
many
of
you
were
coming
back
at
once
sessions
and
treadwell
down
in
the
engine
room
were
killed
outright
and
a
couple
more
of
the
boys
pretty
badly
shot
up
when
they
tried
to
resist
they
the
only
ones
i
know
of
besides
me
rennies
and
his
gang
took
up
headquarters
in
the
control
room
the
last
i
heard
that
about
all
the
dope
i
can
give
you
it
helps
said
underwood
we
can
take
care
of
twenty
of
them
if
we
can
get
organized
take
it
easy
old
man
and
we
be
back
with
help
the
engineer
smiled
and
his
eyes
closed
underwood
and
terry
hurried
out
closing
the
iris
door
behind
them
they
came
to
the
storage
closets
and
found
to
their
relief
that
the
invaders
had
not
removed
the
weapons
stored
there
underwood
selected
another
gun
terry
took
a
pair
i
wish
we
hear
again
from
jandro
said
terry
he
may
be
helping
the
group
down
at
the
locks
we
on
our
own
here
it
appears
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
the
passage
split
forming
a
u
around
the
control
room
because
the
navigational
machinery
had
to
be
located
on
the
axis
of
the
ship
let
separate
underwood
said
it
give
us
a
chance
to
attack
from
two
directions
they
may
not
have
a
guard
that
too
alert
since
we
could
be
expected
to
need
much
guarding
good
idea
said
terry
he
checked
his
watch
with
underwood
begin
firing
in
exactly
sixty
seconds
they
separated
and
went
swiftly
in
opposite
directions
as
underwood
came
to
the
abrupt
turn
that
would
put
him
in
a
direct
line
with
the
door
to
the
control
room
he
halted
and
listened
for
sounds
from
beyond
footsteps
were
moving
carelessly
and
hurriedly
only
one
person
underwood
thought
therefore
it
must
be
one
of
the
disciples
there
was
the
unlikely
possibility
that
one
of
his
own
men
had
escaped
independently
and
had
already
been
to
the
control
room
he
have
to
risk
that
he
stepped
around
the
corner
and
fired
the
shot
caught
the
man
a
disciple
luckily
full
in
the
chest
an
instant
surprised
agony
did
not
prevent
a
wild
cry
from
issuing
from
his
throat
underwood
leaped
over
the
fallen
body
before
the
disciple
ceased
struggling
from
inside
the
control
room
there
were
sudden
confused
shouts
and
orders
underwood
saw
two
figures
running
toward
the
iris
he
fired
twice
then
dropped
to
the
floor
the
first
man
collapsed
in
the
path
of
the
second
but
the
latter
was
only
slightly
wounded
he
raised
his
weapon
toward
underwood
even
as
he
fell
from
his
prone
position
underwood
fired
again
the
blast
missed
and
reddened
the
metal
of
the
far
wall
of
the
room
for
a
moment
underwood
did
not
dare
move
he
could
find
little
shelter
in
the
small
corner
where
the
circled
doorway
did
not
fully
meet
the
rectangular
corridor
but
there
was
no
other
to
be
had
shots
from
within
the
control
room
were
coming
close
now
he
could
feel
the
heat
they
generated
in
the
metal
floor
while
he
tried
to
edge
closer
into
the
corner
somebody
else
came
into
his
view
it
was
an
impressive
militaristic
figure
undoubtedly
commander
rennies
for
his
harsh
arrogant
voice
was
ordering
one
of
the
men
to
call
for
assistance
from
the
other
end
of
the
ship
then
suddenly
the
commander
stiffened
even
underwood
could
glimpse
the
stare
that
glazed
his
eyes
like
polished
glass
jandro
the
others
in
the
room
saw
it
also
and
heard
the
crash
as
the
heavy
body
fell
to
the
floor
the
disaster
to
the
disciples
disrupted
their
attack
for
an
instant
it
was
long
enough
for
underwood
to
get
his
gun
up
and
fire
straight
at
his
opponent
the
man
started
and
whirled
with
a
look
of
surprise
on
his
face
for
an
instant
before
he
died
and
then
another
shot
came
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
and
caught
one
of
the
remaining
defenders
unaware
terry
was
there
at
last
underwood
breathed
heavily
in
relief
he
had
been
afraid
terry
had
been
caught
apparently
the
archeologist
had
met
opposition
of
his
own
and
had
eventually
succeeded
in
overcoming
it
terry
and
underwood
rushed
the
control
room
simultaneously
only
a
single
member
of
the
disciples
was
able
to
offer
resistance
beams
from
the
two
guns
crossed
the
room
and
caught
him
in
a
lethal
blaze
cautiously
underwood
advanced
not
quite
inside
the
doorway
terry
you
there
he
called
check
i
ran
into
one
of
them
in
the
corridor
keep
out
of
the
way
i
going
to
come
in
blasting
in
your
direction
in
case
any
more
of
these
fanatics
are
hiding
right
if
i
do
get
your
okay
in
five
or
so
i
come
in
the
same
way
underwood
set
the
beam
to
a
low
but
deadly
intensity
and
fanned
it
up
and
down
bringing
the
plane
of
motion
ever
nearer
the
wall
that
could
be
hiding
an
attacker
without
exposing
himself
he
extended
his
hand
and
brought
the
gun
about
until
he
knew
the
room
was
cleared
or
that
any
one
hiding
there
had
been
hit
he
entered
then
and
called
to
terry
the
redhead
entered
grinning
but
a
smear
of
blood
covered
his
left
arm
from
the
shoulder
down
terry
you
hurt
i
did
get
him
good
enough
with
my
first
shot
i
be
all
right
what
do
we
do
now
we
can
clear
the
ship
by
throwing
some
chloryl
triptanate
into
the
air
system
but
even
after
that
we
ca
even
go
back
to
the
moon
to
return
jandro
to
his
own
people
that
would
bring
the
whole
fleet
down
on
them
we
figure
something
out
said
terry
optimistically
we
expect
to
get
this
far
i
wonder
what
happened
to
that
guy
jandro
have
you
found
out
where
he
actually
is
yet
no
he
apparently
killed
rennies
but
i
heard
nothing
from
him
i
get
the
triptanate
and
some
mesarpin
for
antidote
if
i
not
back
in
half
an
hour
it
be
your
baby
you
guard
here
said
underwood
you
better
take
it
easy
with
that
arm
of
yours
you
more
important
around
here
than
i
am
i
be
back
in
five
minutes
terry
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
surgery
underwood
sat
down
wearily
and
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
fixed
dead
stare
of
the
eyes
of
commander
rennies
who
lay
on
the
floor
his
name
had
been
vaguely
familiar
to
underwood
and
now
he
knew
why
rennies
had
attained
considerable
renown
in
the
interstellar
military
field
he
had
been
an
able
leader
highly
trained
widely
read
intelligent
and
a
clever
tactician
yet
his
mind
had
been
as
vulnerable
to
demarzule
as
the
most
illiterate
of
the
disciples
then
underwood
became
aware
of
a
slow
stirring
upon
the
floor
the
last
disciple
he
had
shot
was
not
dead
the
lips
twisted
in
a
snarl
of
hate
fools
the
disciple
spat
out
blood
poured
from
between
his
lips
do
you
suppose
you
can
block
the
great
one
the
human
race
waited
ten
thousand
years
for
this
savior
man
shall
become
the
greatest
in
all
the
universe
with
him
as
leader
pay
homage
to
the
great
one
as
all
the
galaxies
shall
pay
homage
to
us
underwood
said
why
because
we
are
the
greatest
he
looked
at
the
man
curiously
it
was
as
if
the
knowledge
of
semantics
did
not
exist
yet
for
twelve
hundred
years
semanticists
had
slowly
been
prying
loose
the
ancient
false
extensions
that
cluttered
thinking
and
dwarfed
their
concepts
demarzule
had
wiped
out
all
of
that
merely
by
his
presence
underwood
found
himself
wondering
why
he
should
be
at
all
concerned
with
the
matter
he
knew
however
that
as
a
member
of
the
human
race
he
had
to
keep
on
hoping
that
the
course
of
evolution
would
lead
it
to
something
greater
than
constant
strife
and
insecurity
he
had
been
blind
when
he
had
tried
to
escape
there
was
no
escape
he
saw
that
very
clearly
now
a
sudden
sound
in
the
corridor
alerted
his
senses
his
gun
moved
slightly
to
cover
the
entrances
then
terry
burst
into
view
with
the
containers
of
chemicals
from
the
surgical
lab
made
it
he
said
any
trouble
here
no
just
one
revived
for
a
little
while
to
gab
he
dead
now
the
man
was
quiet
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
how
do
things
look
out
there
a
lot
of
racket
in
the
direction
of
the
lock
area
must
be
fighting
going
on
down
there
i
did
see
anyone
at
all
near
this
end
while
he
spoke
terry
bent
over
and
moistened
a
strip
of
his
clothing
with
one
of
the
liquids
he
held
it
to
his
nostrils
for
a
moment
and
passed
it
to
underwood
then
he
opened
the
return
air
vent
and
poured
the
contents
of
the
other
bottle
into
it
the
highly
volatile
liquid
quickly
vaporized
and
passed
to
the
fans
of
the
central
ventilating
blowers
from
which
it
passed
into
every
chamber
of
the
ship
within
ten
minutes
it
had
anesthetized
every
person
aboard
the
ship
except
the
two
who
had
inhaled
the
antidote
while
they
waited
underwood
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
dead
rennies
i
wonder
how
jandro
kills
he
said
can
there
be
any
defense
against
such
silent
power
have
you
thought
of
what
that
implies
with
relation
to
jandro
people
and
the
society
they
live
in
terry
nodded
i
have
thought
much
of
anything
else
since
i
first
saw
him
kill
that
guard
in
our
stateroom
a
civilization
in
which
every
member
holds
a
silent
secret
weapon
over
the
head
of
his
neighbor
it
incredible
that
it
could
exist
but
it
existed
and
continues
to
exist
and
i
bet
that
jandro
is
the
first
of
his
kind
to
use
this
power
for
generations
it
certainly
implies
a
stability
and
individual
recognition
of
responsibility
that
has
never
existed
among
us
i
doubt
that
it
ever
will
someday
it
we
wo
be
around
there
something
else
too
underwood
said
this
may
be
the
way
out
for
us
it
could
be
what
do
you
mean
suppose
just
one
of
us
had
the
power
jandro
has
that
would
be
the
weapon
against
demarzule
that
we
need
terry
hesitated
we
not
likely
to
get
that
power
and
if
we
did
we
could
never
get
near
enough
to
demarzule
to
use
it
no
suppose
we
let
the
fleet
capture
us
and
take
us
back
it
my
guess
that
demarzule
wants
us
alive
his
pleasure
in
our
downfall
should
come
from
personally
witnessing
our
defeat
it
would
fit
his
character
so
we
be
brought
back
as
prisoners
then
all
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
to
dispose
of
him
just
as
jandro
did
with
rennies
you
forgetting
that
demarzule
has
the
same
organs
and
the
same
powers
you
do
know
what
kind
of
defense
could
be
offered
against
them
perhaps
they
are
immune
to
such
attacks
themselves
that
would
explain
this
mystery
of
dragboran
civilization
maybe
demarzule
could
detect
it
if
any
of
us
possessed
the
organs
lastly
there
is
absolutely
no
possibility
of
our
getting
them
anyway
underwood
face
darkened
that
the
one
thing
i
have
figured
out
yet
but
there
got
to
be
a
way
it
looks
as
if
this
is
the
only
hope
left
us
to
destroy
the
alien
we
have
to
defeat
the
whole
fleet
to
continue
searching
for
the
dragboran
weapon
and
there
no
chance
of
that
i
hope
you
right
well
the
anesthetic
has
had
time
to
act
revive
our
men
and
set
to
work
on
it
they
made
sure
of
their
weapons
and
left
the
control
room
within
the
whole
ship
there
was
no
sound
except
their
footsteps
in
the
corridor
one
by
one
they
opened
the
stateroom
doors
as
they
went
down
toward
the
locks
they
held
the
cloths
moistened
with
the
restoring
vapors
to
the
nostrils
of
each
of
their
own
men
the
first
were
dreyer
and
phyfe
mason
and
his
crew
were
found
in
the
next
room
toward
the
stern
quick
explanations
were
made
and
those
revived
went
to
the
task
of
restoring
still
others
in
illia
stateroom
they
found
her
lying
composed
upon
her
bunk
for
a
moment
as
he
looked
down
upon
her
serene
features
underwood
forgot
the
intense
urgency
of
his
tasks
he
tried
to
recall
just
why
he
had
been
willing
to
sacrifice
the
life
that
illia
and
he
had
hoped
to
share
sacrifice
because
she
had
believed
in
man
while
underwood
had
wanted
only
escape
from
the
pressure
of
an
erratic
and
chaotic
society
surely
that
life
together
would
not
have
been
postponed
if
he
could
have
seen
the
choices
earlier
as
he
saw
them
now
was
it
too
late
to
hope
now
for
reprieve
from
the
destruction
that
hovered
over
them
he
dared
not
answer
gently
he
restored
her
to
consciousness
i
had
the
nicest
dream
she
said
i
knew
you
were
in
control
as
soon
as
the
first
whiff
of
triptanate
came
through
we
not
in
control
yet
the
main
fleet
will
arrive
within
a
few
hours
and
have
us
cornered
most
of
us
are
revived
with
the
exception
of
a
large
group
down
by
the
locks
will
you
go
up
and
help
armstrong
the
engineer
he
in
and
badly
hurt
we
have
been
able
to
do
a
thing
for
him
yet
illia
nodded
i
take
care
of
him
any
others
terry
here
he
motioned
at
terry
bloodcaked
arm
you
have
to
tie
him
down
to
work
on
him
though
maybe
he
can
go
until
we
get
organized
they
separated
in
the
corridor
and
underwood
hurried
on
toward
the
stern
locks
as
he
came
up
he
could
see
a
large
group
of
the
men
gathered
around
apprehension
drove
him
to
a
run
along
the
narrow
passageway
the
group
turned
as
they
heard
his
footsteps
and
made
a
path
for
him
a
scene
of
death
lay
before
him
bodies
of
scientists
and
disciples
lay
side
by
side
on
the
floor
there
were
roberts
the
surgeon
and
parker
and
muth
two
of
the
chemists
three
others
were
not
recognizable
six
of
his
own
men
had
died
and
five
of
the
disciples
before
the
gas
had
brought
an
instant
and
bloodless
end
to
the
battle
he
turned
away
he
wished
there
might
have
been
some
other
way
than
sacrificing
those
men
but
if
the
scientists
had
not
held
the
lock
the
disciples
might
have
remained
in
permanent
control
of
the
ship
he
beckoned
to
terry
who
was
checking
the
roster
with
mason
have
you
accounted
for
everyone
yet
peters
atchison
and
markham
appear
to
be
the
three
we
identify
said
terry
and
of
course
jandro
no
one
has
heard
or
seen
anything
of
him
since
he
killed
rennies
jandro
underwood
was
suddenly
and
fearfully
aware
of
absence
we
got
to
find
him
there
no
use
of
any
of
us
leaving
unless
we
do
i
could
be
sure
but
i
think
i
saw
him
from
the
lock
viewplates
a
minute
ago
captain
dawson
said
there
no
way
of
telling
except
by
that
oversize
spacesuit
but
he
may
be
lying
on
the
ground
out
there
if
he
been
killed
underwood
raced
toward
the
nearest
viewing
station
he
switched
it
on
and
scanned
the
area
about
the
ship
disciples
were
milling
about
hesitant
about
using
their
atom
stream
weapons
to
force
entrance
without
orders
from
their
commander
dawson
pointed
toward
the
stern
there
it
was
unmistakably
jandro
though
a
blast
had
blackened
the
upper
right
portion
of
the
spacesuit
and
a
gap
showed
in
it
if
the
worked
he
may
not
have
been
out
there
too
long
underwood
said
urgently
dawson
drive
the
mob
back
with
the
big
atom
stream
then
throw
a
force
shell
over
to
jandro
so
we
can
go
out
and
get
him
dawson
hurried
away
calling
for
his
mates
and
engineers
on
his
way
to
the
control
room
underwood
remained
watching
the
exterior
from
the
plate
abruptly
the
disciples
turned
and
fled
in
panic
the
blue
radiance
of
the
atom
stream
played
about
the
ship
clearing
a
space
beyond
jandro
then
the
view
of
all
the
ancient
city
and
the
fleeing
disciples
was
cut
off
as
the
impenetrable
force
shell
went
out
mason
and
two
of
the
crew
were
already
in
suits
and
in
the
lock
they
opened
it
the
instant
the
force
shell
stabilized
jandro
had
been
lying
in
the
sunlight
that
might
have
saved
him
underwood
thought
for
the
suit
absorbed
the
radiant
heat
the
three
men
reached
the
dragboran
and
lifted
him
carefully
they
did
not
know
whether
he
was
dead
or
alive
as
they
gently
rolled
him
onto
a
stretcher
and
carried
him
to
the
ship
underwood
located
akers
the
surgeon
next
in
skill
to
illia
who
ordered
the
surgery
prepared
underwood
left
his
post
and
sought
illia
jandro
would
need
all
her
skill
if
he
still
lived
but
he
wondered
if
the
engineer
armstrong
did
too
underwood
found
her
still
in
the
room
where
armstrong
lay
she
was
rising
from
her
knees
as
he
entered
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
him
said
illia
i
stayed
until
he
died
do
you
need
me
anywhere
else
yes
jandro
was
shot
outside
akers
is
making
ready
but
i
want
you
to
take
over
jandro
is
the
key
to
our
whole
success
here
if
he
alive
he
got
to
be
kept
alive
illia
looked
at
him
questioningly
i
do
my
best
she
cried
akers
was
quite
willing
for
illia
to
take
over
when
he
saw
jandro
the
wound
was
ghastly
to
see
slashing
across
the
full
width
of
the
chest
while
jandro
was
in
surgery
underwood
called
a
general
meeting
they
gathered
rapidly
in
the
conference
room
but
their
worn
and
strained
faces
were
little
short
of
tragic
we
lost
our
chance
for
any
dragboran
we
might
have
found
in
the
ruins
here
said
underwood
without
preamble
defenseless
except
for
the
shell
and
outnumbered
we
ca
run
because
the
fleet
can
run
faster
and
we
ca
stay
bottled
up
here
forever
i
can
think
of
only
one
thing
possible
that
we
can
do
the
others
did
not
need
to
be
reminded
of
the
hopelessness
of
their
situation
but
their
eyes
lighted
with
interest
at
the
last
sentence
then
he
outlined
briefly
his
idea
of
obtaining
the
organs
and
powers
that
jandro
possessed
and
allowing
themselves
to
be
captured
and
taken
to
demarzule
it
sounds
good
for
a
stand
said
mason
but
you
explained
how
we
are
going
to
get
back
to
the
moon
so
that
we
can
obtain
these
things
from
the
dragbora
that
is
the
one
missing
element
of
the
plan
said
underwood
then
he
added
fiercely
and
it
got
to
be
solved
that
why
i
called
you
here
i
have
the
answer
but
together
we
got
to
find
it
it
our
last
chance
to
stop
demarzule
mason
jumped
to
his
feet
there
ought
to
be
several
hours
yet
before
the
fleet
arrives
we
might
have
time
to
rig
up
a
field
generator
and
set
up
a
dummy
here
to
make
the
disciples
believe
we
hiding
under
it
while
we
actually
take
off
for
the
moon
that
it
underwood
exclaimed
only
we
have
to
move
around
the
planet
to
avoid
detection
by
the
local
garrison
but
that
will
do
it
the
interphone
sounded
illia
said
we
finished
del
jandro
is
alive
but
he
be
dead
within
an
hour
if
you
want
to
see
him
better
come
now
underwood
started
for
the
door
without
hesitation
we
try
your
plan
mason
take
over
dreyer
phyfe
please
come
along
with
me
they
hurried
to
the
room
next
to
surgery
where
jandro
lay
in
bed
motionless
and
unseeing
only
illia
and
akers
were
with
him
at
the
sight
of
that
unmoving
figure
underwood
experienced
a
depth
of
sorrow
and
pity
that
wiped
out
all
other
thoughts
for
a
moment
he
felt
that
he
alone
of
all
the
earthmen
could
understand
the
deep
rebellion
the
dreams
and
the
hopes
that
had
been
the
driving
force
in
jandro
life
and
this
was
a
mean
end
for
such
bright
dreams
death
at
the
hands
of
crazed
fanatics
on
a
heaven
world
that
had
proved
to
be
anything
but
that
underwood
thought
of
the
green
shining
moon
of
the
refugee
dragbora
where
men
lived
in
peace
with
one
another
the
moon
that
jandro
would
never
see
again
jandro
eyes
fluttered
open
slowly
and
gradual
recognition
came
into
them
dreyer
said
softly
we
sorry
if
there
were
anything
within
our
power
to
get
you
back
to
your
own
world
and
your
own
people
we
would
do
it
i
hope
you
know
that
of
course
said
jandro
slowly
i
would
like
my
to
be
with
those
of
my
ancestors
for
the
day
when
life
will
return
but
i
think
perhaps
it
never
will
it
is
like
our
dream
of
the
gods
only
a
delusion
as
for
death
that
is
certain
for
every
man
how
or
when
it
comes
is
not
important
it
is
strange
for
me
to
observe
the
grief
of
animals
for
a
man
strange
does
he
suppose
there
was
a
time
when
the
dragbora
never
had
the
and
the
secret
of
the
asked
underwood
and
dreyer
translated
for
him
naturally
jandro
replied
we
were
merely
animals
then
as
you
are
now
when
you
came
in
your
ships
of
metal
all
of
us
thought
surely
the
gods
had
come
to
return
us
to
heaven
world
again
you
did
us
a
great
favor
in
showing
us
how
wrong
we
were
in
our
legends
and
our
dreams
but
until
we
arrived
on
this
planet
i
still
thought
you
were
superior
beings
because
i
could
not
detect
your
none
of
us
have
the
ability
to
hide
it
from
each
other
but
you
knew
it
when
we
were
attacked
said
dreyer
i
could
not
understand
why
you
did
not
act
to
forestall
your
enemies
who
were
so
apparent
to
me
then
i
realized
that
it
was
because
you
did
not
possess
the
at
all
i
was
frightened
because
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
had
never
dreamed
in
all
my
life
that
i
would
meet
with
creatures
who
might
be
gods
because
they
possessed
the
metals
and
yet
were
lower
than
men
because
they
did
not
have
the
i
did
not
understand
we
do
not
understand
many
things
about
each
other
said
underwood
but
perhaps
you
understand
us
well
enough
now
to
know
that
we
need
your
help
against
these
enemies
of
ours
and
of
yours
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
ago
there
was
a
race
called
the
sirenians
and
they
were
deadly
enemies
of
your
race
the
dragbora
like
you
they
possessed
the
but
instead
of
living
peacefully
they
set
out
to
conquer
all
the
worlds
and
the
galaxies
in
the
end
they
were
defeated
by
your
people
who
had
some
mysterious
weapon
that
penetrated
every
defense
of
the
sirenians
we
came
to
your
ancient
world
to
find
a
clue
to
that
weapon
because
one
of
the
sirenians
succeeded
in
surviving
and
is
now
at
large
upon
our
own
world
he
has
seized
control
over
our
people
and
is
setting
out
to
sweep
the
galaxies
with
conquest
and
blood
in
time
he
will
find
even
your
little
world
the
civilizations
of
many
galaxies
will
suffer
centuries
of
retrogression
we
did
find
the
weapon
we
came
for
and
now
our
chance
is
gone
for
the
fleet
of
demarzule
the
sirenian
is
almost
upon
us
there
is
just
one
hope
left
to
us
we
believe
that
his
men
will
capture
us
alive
and
take
us
to
him
if
we
permit
it
if
we
could
be
taken
into
his
presence
bearing
the
power
of
destruction
that
lies
in
the
we
might
be
able
to
destroy
him
can
you
will
you
make
it
possible
for
us
to
gain
that
power
by
grafting
the
in
some
of
us
upon
your
world
dreyer
translated
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
swift
spoken
words
of
underwood
while
jandro
lay
with
closed
eyes
as
if
sleeping
a
dreamless
sleep
it
was
a
long
time
after
dreyer
finished
that
jandro
slowly
opened
his
eyes
again
his
voice
was
so
low
that
dreyer
had
to
lean
forward
to
catch
his
words
it
is
a
strange
story
you
tell
he
said
but
i
am
impressed
that
what
you
say
is
true
as
to
your
request
no
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
you
to
be
given
fresh
as
are
the
young
of
our
race
not
that
i
would
make
it
possible
for
some
of
you
a
very
few
to
receive
them
if
i
could
but
the
can
be
installed
in
only
the
very
young
the
use
of
the
is
similar
to
that
of
the
organs
of
walking
or
speaking
the
organs
must
develop
from
their
rudimentary
forms
through
long
years
of
usage
and
skill
with
them
comes
much
more
slowly
than
any
of
the
other
common
skills
though
they
are
installed
in
us
in
infancy
most
of
us
are
well
matured
before
we
gain
great
skill
for
this
reason
alone
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
have
the
organs
across
the
bed
underwood
eyes
met
illia
and
held
for
an
endless
moment
in
her
he
sought
strength
to
endure
the
crushing
disappointment
illia
eyes
gave
him
blind
assurance
that
there
would
yet
be
a
way
your
race
will
in
time
develop
and
learn
the
use
of
the
jandro
went
on
but
not
for
many
hundreds
of
generations
from
what
i
have
seen
of
your
people
i
wonder
what
your
world
would
be
like
if
every
one
possessed
the
power
to
kill
at
will
silently
and
without
detection
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
ask
you
to
answer
it
for
yourselves
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
not
yet
developed
the
is
proof
that
you
are
not
ready
for
it
the
dragbora
live
in
peace
not
because
they
have
such
terrible
power
they
can
live
with
such
power
because
they
have
first
learned
how
men
must
live
with
one
another
you
can
not
understand
why
the
power
of
death
is
inherent
in
the
it
is
merely
one
of
the
inevitable
functions
that
accompany
the
other
greater
and
more
useful
powers
most
of
which
you
shall
of
course
never
know
i
wonder
if
you
would
want
the
even
if
it
were
possible
for
you
to
possess
it
jandro
finished
for
our
race
no
underwood
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
every
man
of
earth
possessing
instant
undetectable
powers
of
death
over
his
neighbor
you
are
right
in
that
jandro
whatever
the
other
powers
of
the
may
be
we
could
not
live
with
it
but
demarzule
is
a
totally
extraneous
factor
not
considered
in
our
own
evolution
we
have
no
defense
against
him
if
the
power
of
death
in
the
could
be
used
to
destroy
him
it
would
give
our
race
its
one
chance
of
staving
off
this
threat
yet
you
say
it
is
impossible
it
means
for
us
no
hope
against
the
barbarism
that
will
destroy
our
civilization
and
brutalize
our
people
not
to
mention
what
it
means
to
the
other
civilizations
of
the
galaxy
including
your
own
there
was
scarcely
the
sound
of
their
breathing
within
the
room
as
the
earthmen
avoided
each
others
eyes
now
staring
down
at
the
closed
ones
of
jandro
your
people
hardly
deserve
the
scourge
of
demarzule
and
the
sirenian
demand
for
supremacy
said
jandro
slowly
and
what
you
say
of
the
rest
of
the
universe
is
true
in
a
way
the
dragbora
are
responsible
demarzule
is
a
product
of
the
culture
my
ancestors
should
have
made
more
sure
of
the
total
extinction
of
the
sirenian
branch
perhaps
there
is
one
way
in
which
we
could
yet
help
you
help
underwood
asked
eagerly
and
incredulously
i
have
little
longer
to
live
it
would
be
worthwhile
if
in
that
hour
left
to
me
i
could
complete
the
task
of
extinction
or
at
least
enable
you
to
do
so
if
one
of
you
is
willing
to
take
the
risk
i
will
do
what
i
can
no
risk
is
too
great
but
what
can
be
done
as
far
as
i
know
it
has
never
been
attempted
but
perhaps
my
own
could
be
transferred
to
you
dreyer
translated
the
offer
his
glance
going
from
illia
to
underwood
something
of
hope
seemed
to
come
again
into
his
eyes
underwood
caught
his
breath
sharply
a
set
of
fully
developed
transferred
to
my
own
body
there
would
be
one
of
us
to
meet
demarzule
on
his
own
level
illia
her
face
was
suddenly
white
it
impossible
del
i
could
perform
such
an
operation
without
any
previous
study
with
their
anatomy
i
ca
do
it
it
got
to
be
done
illia
i
take
a
chance
on
your
skill
that
an
utterly
ridiculous
statement
i
have
no
skill
in
a
case
like
this
tell
him
dreyer
he
ca
expect
that
much
of
me
i
do
know
illia
said
the
semanticist
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
confusing
your
analysis
by
your
own
personal
emotions
you
can
not
be
evaluating
properly
under
such
conditions
she
bit
her
lips
to
hold
back
a
further
outburst
then
at
last
she
said
do
ask
the
impossible
of
me
del
i
saw
the
way
they
split
the
nerves
in
the
operation
we
watched
it
could
be
done
without
long
practise
most
of
all
i
could
do
it
to
you
as
if
sensing
the
meaning
of
their
argument
jandro
spoke
suddenly
you
will
have
great
difficulty
in
making
a
successful
installation
because
you
are
unfamiliar
with
the
anatomy
of
the
true
but
i
can
help
i
can
guide
and
direct
your
hands
up
to
the
very
point
of
cutting
the
nerves
to
the
you
shall
succeed
if
you
allow
me
to
guide
you
underwood
kept
his
eyes
upon
illia
her
face
was
as
pale
as
her
shining
hair
i
try
del
she
said
news
of
the
projected
experiment
sped
swiftly
through
the
ship
and
its
significance
was
greeted
with
awed
incomprehension
as
if
underwood
has
suddenly
stepped
from
their
midst
into
a
misty
realm
beyond
their
reach
and
their
awe
was
magnified
by
the
knowledge
that
it
could
very
well
mean
death
within
minutes
of
the
decision
assistants
were
rolling
the
tables
bearing
the
white
sheeted
forms
of
underwood
and
jandro
into
the
surgery
a
strange
peace
a
sort
of
ecstasy
seemed
to
have
come
over
jandro
underwood
had
seen
and
heard
of
resignation
in
the
face
of
death
but
never
such
serenity
as
possessed
jandro
it
had
a
calming
effect
upon
underwood
and
he
shed
the
thoughts
of
his
own
possible
death
or
maiming
as
a
result
of
the
strange
operation
he
thought
only
of
the
mission
that
would
be
his
once
he
owned
the
powers
of
the
dragbora
whatever
turmoil
possessed
illia
had
vanished
as
she
faced
underwood
the
sterile
white
of
her
surgeon
garb
masked
her
personality
and
her
feelings
and
left
only
a
nameless
agent
possessed
of
science
and
skill
underwood
grinned
up
at
her
as
the
anesthetic
was
injected
when
i
wake
up
i
let
you
know
how
it
feels
to
be
a
dragboran
at
the
adjacent
operating
table
akers
was
preparing
jandro
for
the
preliminary
work
of
exposing
the
organs
then
to
each
of
them
came
the
unspoken
command
to
abandon
their
minds
by
jandro
it
was
an
incredible
unearthly
experience
but
they
released
their
senses
and
gradually
the
guiding
impulses
from
the
dragboran
brain
surged
into
their
own
for
just
the
barest
fraction
of
an
instant
illia
hand
trembled
as
she
touched
the
electronic
scalpel
to
the
flesh
at
the
base
of
underwood
shaven
skull
the
skin
severed
and
her
nerves
were
threads
of
steel
with
increasing
speed
akers
and
illia
made
the
incisions
in
the
bodies
before
them
their
hands
moved
surely
as
if
jandro
were
seeing
with
their
eyes
and
using
their
hands
the
deep
incision
was
made
in
underwood
skull
the
pulsing
brain
lay
exposed
illia
concentrated
for
an
instant
as
waves
of
instruction
flowed
from
jandro
then
swiftly
the
scalpel
cut
a
bloodless
path
through
a
section
of
unused
tissue
she
moved
to
the
adjacent
table
and
peered
into
the
wound
that
akers
had
made
in
jandro
head
she
paused
as
his
words
came
to
her
this
is
the
final
step
i
can
go
no
further
with
you
attend
to
my
instructions
now
and
you
shall
succeed
flashing
incomprehensible
things
flooded
into
her
mind
imperishable
photographs
of
the
remainder
of
this
operation
and
the
one
to
follow
in
which
the
two
abdominal
organs
would
be
transferred
illia
knew
that
every
picture
would
return
in
its
own
time
to
guide
her
hands
in
unfamiliar
paths
proceed
jandro
suddenly
commanded
i
retire
to
the
farewell
the
flowing
pictures
ceased
and
illia
felt
suddenly
alone
like
a
child
lost
amid
a
blinding
storm
there
was
nothing
to
depend
on
now
but
her
own
skill
and
the
telepathic
instructions
she
faltered
for
an
instant
and
breathed
a
name
del
del
akers
was
watching
her
sharply
as
she
stood
staring
at
the
strange
unearthly
organ
lying
in
the
brain
pan
of
the
dead
dragboran
but
it
was
not
strange
she
knew
its
constitution
and
anatomy
and
the
complex
nerve
that
connected
it
with
the
brain
they
were
as
clear
as
if
she
had
studied
them
for
many
years
a
surge
of
gladness
and
confidence
filled
her
she
was
alone
in
this
yes
but
that
did
not
matter
any
more
she
alone
possessed
the
ability
to
perform
the
operation
and
a
world
awaited
the
results
her
scalpel
entered
the
incision
and
touched
the
flesh
with
a
pinpoint
of
destruction
that
sheared
away
the
tissue
from
the
delicate
white
nerve
channels
serving
the
organ
for
a
full
hour
and
then
another
akers
watched
in
fascination
as
illia
freed
the
twelve
separate
nerve
filaments
serving
it
then
cut
the
artery
and
filled
the
vessels
with
the
chemical
solution
that
would
feed
the
cells
until
underwood
blood
could
be
sent
pouring
through
it
at
last
all
that
remained
was
the
severing
of
the
connecting
tissues
that
held
the
organ
in
place
illia
cut
them
and
plunged
her
hands
into
the
sterilizing
protecting
compound
that
had
been
prepared
at
instructions
she
salved
the
organ
and
lifted
it
out
then
thrust
it
quickly
into
the
corresponding
cavity
in
underwood
brain
pan
this
phase
of
the
operation
was
less
than
half
over
blood
vessels
had
to
be
prepared
to
serve
the
new
organ
in
underwood
body
and
the
twelve
nerves
had
to
be
connected
into
the
great
sympathetic
where
no
such
nerves
had
ever
been
connected
before
another
two
hours
passed
before
the
final
sutures
closed
the
wound
in
underwood
head
when
at
last
she
laid
the
needle
down
illia
hand
suddenly
trembled
and
she
quivered
throughout
her
body
ca
we
postpone
the
others
for
a
time
asked
akers
you
surely
ca
go
on
with
two
more
like
that
i
afraid
the
tissues
will
degenerate
too
much
if
we
delay
if
i
were
only
as
fast
as
those
dragboran
surgeons
what
men
they
must
be
get
me
a
shot
of
neostrene
and
better
have
one
yourself
we
go
on
akers
was
willing
but
he
did
believe
that
illia
could
stand
more
hours
of
exacting
surgery
after
a
moment
rest
however
and
a
shot
of
the
stimulant
drug
she
stepped
back
to
the
operating
tables
to
perform
the
adbominal
operation
once
again
akers
made
the
preliminary
incisions
in
the
control
room
the
group
leaders
waited
for
news
in
inactivity
terry
bernard
paced
about
his
flaming
disheveled
hair
like
a
signal
flare
swinging
through
the
room
phyfe
stood
at
one
of
the
observation
panels
watching
the
inexorable
approach
of
fleet
dawson
sat
at
his
captain
position
fingering
the
inactive
switches
on
the
panel
before
him
most
placid
of
all
dreyer
simply
sat
in
the
navigation
chair
and
smoked
cigars
so
unrelentingly
that
it
taxed
the
ventilating
system
of
the
ship
terry
glanced
at
the
clock
anxiously
and
stopped
his
pacing
it
been
over
thirteen
hours
since
underwood
went
in
there
do
you
think
we
ought
to
ask
illia
there
are
only
two
alternatives
said
dreyer
success
or
failure
our
questioning
will
not
assure
success
we
had
best
keep
out
of
the
way
mason
kept
anxious
watch
of
the
progress
of
the
fleet
no
one
knew
what
would
happen
when
the
battleships
arrived
and
surrounded
the
but
they
had
not
long
to
wait
the
ships
were
hardly
more
than
minutes
away
from
the
planet
as
if
guided
by
a
single
mind
the
ships
turned
slowly
in
the
black
sky
as
their
navigators
and
lookouts
spotted
and
set
a
course
for
the
luminous
bubble
that
marked
the
force
shell
hiding
the
to
the
crewmen
watching
from
within
it
was
a
fearful
sight
to
witness
the
sudden
plunging
flight
of
those
twenty
mighty
ships
simultaneously
a
score
of
fearful
atom
streams
were
turned
upon
the
bubble
apparently
not
in
the
futile
hope
of
burning
through
the
protection
but
to
destroy
the
minute
sensory
probes
and
prevent
the
ship
from
navigating
away
from
the
planet
in
spatial
combat
where
the
ship
was
free
to
wheel
and
turn
and
defend
itself
it
would
not
have
been
so
easy
to
destroy
the
probes
but
with
the
ship
motionless
upon
the
surface
of
the
planet
the
streams
of
incomprehensible
fire
washed
over
every
square
millimeter
of
the
surface
of
the
shell
probing
destroying
and
setting
off
the
multitude
of
relays
within
the
closing
the
hairlike
openings
in
the
shell
as
the
probes
were
burned
away
mason
moved
away
as
one
after
another
of
the
segments
on
his
plates
went
dead
until
there
was
no
vision
whatever
of
the
outside
world
he
turned
to
the
others
and
motioned
toward
the
dead
plates
this
is
it
the
spell
that
fell
upon
them
was
broken
minutes
later
by
abrupt
voice
on
the
interphone
the
operation
is
finished
consciousness
came
to
underwood
as
if
he
were
responding
to
the
persistent
voice
of
some
unseen
speaker
it
called
him
out
of
the
depths
of
eternal
existence
into
the
realm
of
conflict
and
reality
curiously
it
sounded
like
jandro
he
opened
his
eyes
illia
was
there
her
face
white
and
strained
but
as
he
looked
at
her
her
blue
eyes
glistened
and
she
bent
down
del
oh
del
terry
phyfe
mason
and
akers
were
standing
near
the
bed
watching
with
anxious
faces
pain
was
beginning
to
show
itself
in
burning
streamers
but
he
managed
a
quick
smile
to
those
about
him
looks
like
we
made
it
all
right
he
said
i
wonder
what
i
can
do
with
these
gadgets
now
think
work
illia
she
raised
up
brisk
and
businesslike
once
more
you
are
going
to
find
out
for
a
while
i
intend
to
knock
you
out
for
a
good
cold
hours
give
me
your
arm
she
reached
for
a
hypo
needle
on
the
table
beside
the
bed
it
was
like
stumbling
around
in
the
dark
at
first
trying
to
run
from
an
unseen
pursuer
but
all
at
once
underwood
knew
he
did
need
to
run
at
all
the
hypo
was
blocking
the
sensory
equipment
in
other
parts
of
his
body
but
it
could
affect
the
organs
if
he
want
it
to
he
stopped
running
and
watched
the
ordinary
faculties
of
his
body
give
way
while
he
stood
aside
in
complete
immunity
it
was
as
if
he
could
step
outside
and
look
at
himself
and
suddenly
that
was
what
he
was
doing
he
could
see
the
room
the
watching
scientists
and
illia
carefully
checking
his
heartbeat
and
respiration
he
could
see
himself
lying
still
with
eyes
closed
curiously
he
could
not
identify
the
point
of
view
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
was
up
near
the
ceiling
somewhere
looking
down
but
that
was
right
either
because
he
could
see
the
ceiling
just
as
well
as
the
floor
or
the
four
walls
the
scene
was
like
a
picture
taken
with
a
lens
having
a
solid
angle
of
perception
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
he
wondered
if
he
could
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
room
tried
it
and
found
it
quite
easy
to
do
there
was
some
clumsiness
due
to
inexperience
and
conditioning
that
stopped
him
at
the
walls
where
he
had
a
moment
claustrophobic
fright
of
being
trapped
between
the
metal
panels
but
it
was
over
in
an
instant
and
he
was
through
he
went
toward
the
control
room
and
found
it
occupied
only
by
dreyer
who
remained
placidly
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
navigator
chair
underwood
wanted
to
communicate
with
the
semanticist
only
he
sure
how
to
go
about
it
it
was
like
trying
to
talk
with
a
mouth
full
of
dry
crackers
but
dreyer
stared
around
with
a
sudden
start
he
removed
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
looked
agape
for
an
unseen
speaker
dreyer
can
you
hear
me
underwood
you
succeeded
after
a
fashion
so
far
it
like
walking
around
in
deep
mud
but
getting
used
to
it
gradually
this
is
wonderful
dreyer
breathed
i
had
dared
hope
that
i
would
ever
hear
your
voice
again
where
are
you
that
a
tough
question
theoretically
i
unconscious
back
in
sick
bay
with
a
shot
of
that
will
keep
me
out
for
hours
illia
and
the
others
are
back
there
watching
me
the
senses
are
at
all
affected
by
the
drug
i
seem
to
be
able
to
wander
anywhere
i
wish
about
the
ship
the
funny
part
is
that
i
ca
pin
down
a
point
of
view
i
do
seem
to
be
anywhere
nevertheless
my
senses
perceive
distant
sounds
and
objects
including
my
own
corpus
can
you
detect
my
thoughts
when
i
do
speak
jandro
did
seem
able
to
do
that
underwood
laughed
i
do
know
whether
i
can
or
not
i
try
but
all
i
get
is
a
fuzzy
static
i
sure
that
these
organs
have
dozens
of
functions
that
we
have
even
dreamed
of
yet
i
hope
that
i
can
learn
to
use
them
all
what
do
you
plan
now
do
you
need
a
period
of
exercise
and
study
some
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
would
have
needed
if
it
had
been
jandro
mature
organs
that
were
grafted
into
me
there
is
something
that
we
never
thought
of
before
though
what
is
that
we
can
still
search
for
the
dragboran
weapon
we
came
here
for
i
can
go
outside
the
ship
with
these
new
senses
i
do
know
whether
i
can
cover
the
whole
planet
or
not
but
if
not
we
can
move
to
keep
in
range
of
my
powers
it
will
be
slow
because
i
am
the
only
one
who
can
do
it
but
it
may
be
faster
in
the
end
because
i
can
get
around
more
quickly
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
possible
in
the
presence
of
the
fleet
or
did
you
know
that
they
had
arrived
dreyer
pointed
toward
the
blank
viewplates
i
did
know
what
are
they
doing
there
underwood
realized
immediately
the
absurdity
of
the
question
dreyer
could
know
no
more
about
it
than
he
since
all
communication
with
the
outside
was
destroyed
with
all
the
strength
he
could
gather
he
hurled
his
new
powers
beyond
the
scope
of
the
ship
out
into
the
contrasting
heat
and
cold
of
the
barren
planet
it
was
as
if
he
had
hurled
himself
high
into
space
for
he
was
viewing
the
broad
expanse
of
the
dragboran
world
and
the
busy
fleet
of
demarzule
underwood
senses
revolted
at
what
he
saw
completely
surrounding
the
ship
was
utter
flaming
destruction
the
great
city
of
the
dragbora
had
been
turned
into
molten
ruin
by
the
twenty
ships
which
spiraled
slowly
their
powerful
beams
of
the
atom
stream
turned
upon
the
buildings
below
even
as
underwood
watched
they
completed
their
work
upon
that
city
and
traveled
toward
another
great
city
less
than
a
hundred
miles
away
what
purpose
was
behind
the
wanton
ruin
underwood
could
not
comprehend
perhaps
now
that
the
scientists
had
been
cornered
the
terrestrians
hoped
to
destroy
the
that
could
unseat
demarzule
within
hours
the
major
cities
of
the
planet
would
be
shapeless
mounds
of
frozen
lava
he
debated
trying
to
enter
those
vessels
and
overpowering
members
of
their
crews
at
once
his
reason
told
him
no
for
he
was
still
a
toddler
in
the
use
of
the
new
faculties
he
possessed
but
there
was
a
greater
reason
too
if
he
should
expose
himself
by
such
attacks
the
ships
would
send
word
to
earth
and
demarzule
would
easily
identify
the
methods
used
against
his
men
and
be
prepared
underwood
knew
how
this
destruction
of
archeological
treasures
would
affect
phyfe
and
terry
but
more
important
was
the
loss
of
any
chance
to
search
for
the
weapon
he
turned
his
senses
toward
the
bubble
of
the
shell
that
hid
the
its
shining
surface
was
the
only
thing
in
all
that
broad
city
that
did
not
reek
of
destruction
as
underwood
regarded
it
a
shock
of
comprehension
hit
him
in
the
impetuousness
of
his
flight
above
the
planet
he
had
overlooked
the
most
significant
point
of
all
he
his
senses
at
least
passed
through
the
impenetrable
force
sudden
fear
mingled
with
that
devastating
realization
could
he
get
back
through
it
how
had
he
passed
the
barrier
in
the
first
place
it
was
mathematically
impossible
for
matter
or
energy
to
be
transferred
across
it
did
his
senses
represent
neither
one
he
impelled
himself
toward
it
waited
for
the
impact
and
felt
none
then
he
was
through
looking
at
the
interior
of
the
shell
and
the
ship
within
it
his
mind
was
afire
with
the
significance
of
his
discovery
as
he
burst
into
the
control
room
the
others
had
rejoined
dreyer
there
mason
and
some
of
his
men
were
struggling
to
replace
some
of
the
probes
now
that
the
attack
upon
the
ship
had
ceased
for
the
moment
we
found
it
underwood
shouted
we
got
the
weapon
that
dragbor
turned
upon
sirenia
illia
screamed
at
the
sudden
impact
upon
her
worn
nerve
cells
mason
whirled
around
in
horror
and
cried
underwood
where
are
you
we
can
hit
them
wherever
they
try
to
hide
said
underwood
no
matter
where
demarzule
tries
to
flee
i
find
him
there
no
place
in
the
universe
he
can
hide
from
me
underwood
physical
body
recovered
slowly
from
the
severe
shock
of
the
operation
he
was
immune
to
the
pain
of
it
however
for
having
the
senses
was
like
possessing
another
body
he
could
close
all
the
normal
channels
of
perception
and
exist
with
his
consciousness
operating
only
through
the
senses
while
the
fleet
sped
about
the
planet
on
its
path
of
useless
destruction
underwood
spent
his
hours
practising
the
use
of
his
new
powers
gradually
he
obtained
an
understanding
of
their
properties
and
some
of
their
functions
the
was
the
sensory
organ
located
at
the
base
of
his
brain
which
could
pick
up
distant
focusable
sensations
which
any
of
his
normal
five
senses
could
detect
they
were
controllable
in
their
subjective
effects
however
as
he
had
found
when
going
beyond
the
limits
of
the
ship
though
he
had
been
unaware
of
the
interstellar
cold
it
had
no
subjective
effect
upon
his
body
or
his
sensory
apparatus
the
was
the
organ
of
communication
but
it
worked
in
combination
with
the
in
order
to
transmit
and
receive
sensory
effects
so
it
was
that
the
two
of
them
in
combination
could
transmit
not
only
ordinary
communication
but
could
convey
the
actual
sensations
of
heat
cold
light
sound
and
these
same
two
organs
were
capable
of
dispensing
swift
and
silent
death
how
this
happened
was
the
greatest
mystery
underwood
had
to
solve
he
experimented
by
hurling
the
powers
upon
an
artificial
nervous
system
rigged
up
from
a
network
of
wires
a
strong
electric
field
was
definitely
measured
within
the
wires
but
it
had
properties
that
were
not
within
the
physicists
prior
experience
regardless
underwood
continued
with
his
practising
and
found
that
he
could
increase
the
strength
of
that
field
more
each
time
if
necessary
a
full
understanding
of
how
it
destroyed
nerve
tissue
could
wait
until
they
reach
their
objectives
upon
earth
the
third
organ
the
was
the
strangest
of
all
interconnected
intimately
with
the
other
two
through
nerve
channels
it
nevertheless
had
no
obvious
functions
jandro
had
referred
to
it
as
the
receptacle
of
life
it
appeared
to
be
the
belief
of
the
dragbora
that
everything
representing
the
individual
could
be
drawn
into
the
when
death
approached
eons
ago
the
art
of
artificially
reconstructing
new
bodies
into
which
the
organ
could
be
placed
a
process
constituting
literal
resurrection
had
been
lost
but
the
dragbora
lived
in
hope
of
recovering
the
forgotten
knowledge
this
was
their
explanation
of
the
preservation
of
the
each
family
possessing
the
vast
collection
of
its
ancestral
organs
back
to
the
time
of
the
expulsion
from
their
parent
world
what
basis
in
fact
there
was
to
this
theory
the
scientists
did
not
know
apparently
such
resurrection
had
never
been
accomplished
yet
with
each
death
the
was
religiously
removed
and
preserved
underwood
felt
like
some
ancient
gladiator
training
for
an
arena
battle
but
never
had
any
gladiator
fought
for
such
a
prize
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
at
the
moment
he
faced
demarzule
and
challenged
the
sirenian
he
might
face
equal
and
perhaps
superior
powers
of
destruction
for
demarzule
was
old
in
experience
there
was
a
defense
against
it
and
to
this
underwood
turned
his
attention
for
it
was
difficult
in
function
the
had
the
power
to
absorb
and
store
the
destructive
energies
underwood
discovered
it
almost
by
accident
when
mason
technicians
set
up
equipment
for
duplicating
the
destructive
force
as
nearly
as
possible
it
was
weak
and
wholly
ineffective
but
it
acted
upon
the
and
the
organ
absorbed
it
involuntarily
he
was
absolutely
confident
that
they
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
great
weapon
for
which
they
had
come
the
ancient
culture
had
obviously
possessed
the
force
shell
as
a
protection
toshmere
words
made
that
plain
but
they
had
misunderstood
the
implications
when
he
had
said
they
have
found
a
way
through
the
barrier
our
men
are
falling
one
by
one
trained
in
physical
ways
of
thinking
they
had
overlooked
any
such
possibility
as
the
superior
powers
of
the
dragboran
there
was
one
other
thing
that
worried
underwood
however
and
that
was
the
possibility
of
producing
the
effects
of
the
weapon
by
electronic
means
though
the
scientists
were
failing
almost
completely
in
their
attempts
to
do
that
he
wondered
if
perhaps
the
terrestrians
under
demarzule
might
not
succeed
in
the
scientists
favor
however
was
the
fact
that
though
he
possessed
a
vast
reservoir
of
scientific
knowledge
demarzule
was
still
only
the
dictator
the
politician
he
was
no
scientist
on
the
third
day
following
the
operation
underwood
was
able
to
be
up
about
the
ship
for
a
few
moments
though
by
means
of
the
senses
he
had
been
actively
supervising
the
work
in
the
laboratory
during
the
entire
time
he
felt
his
powers
growing
almost
hourly
and
the
vista
of
the
new
world
of
physical
and
mental
powers
into
which
he
was
coming
was
almost
overwhelming
he
sensed
other
new
and
untried
properties
of
the
organs
which
he
dared
not
experiment
with
yet
there
would
be
time
enough
when
they
reached
earth
an
accurate
watch
had
been
kept
on
the
battle
fleet
from
earth
its
wanton
firing
of
the
ancient
cities
was
completed
by
the
time
underwood
was
able
to
rise
physically
from
his
bed
the
observer
reported
the
ships
were
turning
about
and
returning
in
the
direction
of
the
we
better
get
into
space
said
underwood
there
no
reason
for
staying
here
longer
and
i
do
want
them
to
burn
away
all
our
probes
again
if
we
can
help
it
they
may
try
to
send
a
surrender
demand
or
something
of
the
sort
but
let
be
in
space
where
we
can
maneuver
when
they
do
it
the
lifted
from
the
surface
of
the
planet
its
course
set
for
earth
more
than
ninety
million
light
years
away
the
force
shell
about
it
glistened
in
space
like
a
new
star
and
through
the
probes
the
observers
aboard
saw
the
fleet
swiftly
shift
its
course
in
pursuit
underwood
left
the
ship
and
let
his
senses
rove
through
the
space
about
the
vessel
he
remained
like
some
omnipotent
observer
in
space
while
the
shining
bubble
sped
through
the
heavens
behind
it
came
the
twenty
mighty
battleships
their
acceleration
high
enough
to
overtake
the
impulsively
underwood
drifted
toward
the
nearest
and
entered
through
the
hull
it
was
the
giant
flagship
the
disciples
who
formed
the
fighting
forces
were
like
men
reborn
there
was
none
of
the
blasé
disillusioned
attitude
that
had
been
prevalent
upon
earth
before
the
coming
of
demarzule
instead
there
was
a
zealous
inspired
attitude
that
frightened
underwood
it
was
a
fanatic
desperate
unhealthy
thing
he
tried
to
picture
the
nations
of
the
earth
filled
with
such
men
driven
by
the
same
kind
of
unholy
inspiration
it
sickened
him
for
even
if
demarzule
were
destroyed
the
earth
would
be
no
place
where
a
sane
man
could
find
peace
for
decades
to
come
in
death
demarzule
might
become
a
martyr
and
live
more
strongly
than
ever
in
the
minds
of
his
followers
as
underwood
moved
so
strangely
among
his
enemies
he
heard
occasional
remarks
concerning
the
and
its
scientists
blasphemer
and
infidel
were
the
mildest
terms
applied
to
them
he
came
to
the
control
room
where
the
admiral
was
in
conference
with
the
captain
of
the
flagship
we
have
our
orders
captain
montrose
the
admiral
was
saying
destruction
of
the
ship
and
all
its
occupants
is
to
be
complete
that
supersedes
the
command
to
take
prisoners
then
the
admiral
nodded
orders
will
be
dispatched
to
all
vessels
at
once
we
will
make
a
combined
attack
with
the
new
force
shell
disruptor
underwood
froze
at
the
words
had
demarzule
brought
back
with
him
some
terrible
means
of
penetrating
the
force
shell
and
rendering
it
useless
that
was
absolutely
the
only
defense
the
had
her
own
atom
stream
projectors
would
be
ineffective
against
the
twenty
encircling
ships
underwood
heard
the
orders
given
throughout
the
flagship
an
electric
tension
filled
the
air
it
was
the
first
time
the
weapon
had
been
tried
against
an
enemy
underwood
supposed
the
crewmen
were
eager
with
a
sickening
lust
to
kill
underwood
went
swiftly
through
the
ship
searching
to
locate
the
machines
that
would
be
turned
upon
the
helpless
laboratory
ship
he
still
did
quite
believe
that
anything
could
break
down
the
force
shell
but
when
he
saw
the
weapons
he
knew
that
defeat
had
come
for
a
civilization
which
had
learned
to
depend
upon
the
force
shell
for
its
protection
he
watched
the
crewmen
at
the
complicated
boards
that
controlled
the
input
of
power
and
the
focusing
of
the
radiators
upon
the
distant
target
underwood
sped
away
to
the
distant
to
see
what
effect
the
onslaught
was
having
the
force
shell
about
the
ship
glowed
with
the
faint
pinkish
aura
of
the
twenty
beams
that
converged
upon
it
as
he
came
up
there
was
no
apparent
effect
but
all
at
once
the
glistening
shell
grew
red
in
a
spot
as
the
force
field
weakened
then
underwood
comprehended
the
means
by
which
the
disruptor
worked
it
did
not
penetrate
the
shell
that
was
an
impossibility
but
it
unbalanced
the
forces
that
held
the
field
in
a
shell
and
caused
it
to
rotate
this
in
turn
created
a
tremendous
flow
of
energy
through
the
generators
aboard
the
and
shortly
would
burn
them
out
leaving
the
ship
the
defenseless
prey
of
the
atom
streams
there
was
no
time
to
enter
the
to
warn
them
underwood
returned
with
bodiless
velocity
to
the
there
in
the
depths
of
the
ship
he
found
the
chief
operator
who
was
directing
those
beams
toward
the
with
all
the
power
of
his
organs
he
hurled
a
devastating
wave
of
energy
into
the
nerve
channels
the
result
was
shocking
to
one
unaccustomed
to
killing
the
man
jerked
upright
before
his
panel
staggered
uncertainly
and
fell
across
the
maze
of
switches
there
was
no
time
for
reaction
within
underwood
at
his
merciless
first
slaying
the
complex
machinery
of
the
disruptor
sputtered
to
a
halt
amid
the
clatter
of
relays
underwood
moved
into
the
next
sector
of
the
ship
where
the
powerful
atom
stream
projectors
awaited
their
prey
he
carefully
extended
the
powers
of
the
it
was
almost
as
if
he
could
feel
his
way
along
the
nerve
channels
of
the
operator
mind
into
the
depths
of
the
brain
there
he
sent
forth
a
sudden
wild
command
the
operator
unquestioningly
spun
the
wheels
that
shifted
the
radiators
they
came
to
rest
upon
the
nearest
ship
of
the
fleet

underwood
commanded
the
operator
fingers
closed
upon
the
switches
the
atom
stream
lashed
into
space
tore
open
the
vitals
of
the
sister
ship
and
flung
the
fragments
out
into
space
some
crashed
into
other
ships
battering
them
throwing
them
off
course
for
a
moment
after
the
catastrophe
the
commanders
of
the
fleet
were
stunned
to
inactivity
while
confusion
swept
the
ranks
the
hysterical
cries
of
the
operator
who
had
pulled
the
switches
filled
the
room
i
did
do
it
he
screamed
something
made
me
some
of
the
ships
were
still
attacking
the
underwood
did
know
how
long
they
could
hold
out
he
sped
to
the
nearest
ship
where
there
was
milder
but
no
less
disrupting
confusion
as
news
of
the
unexplained
disaster
filtered
down
to
the
lowest
underwood
sought
out
the
fire
control
chamber
he
fingered
his
way
along
the
nerve
channels
of
the
operator
and
swung
the
projectors
around
this
time
the
target
was
the
mighty
flagship
the
operator
gasped
with
horror
as
the
titanic
hull
came
into
view
in
his
sights
yet
with
unerring
accuracy
his
hands
moved
the
radiators
to
center
exactly
on
the
target
his
fingers
pressed
the
switches
soundlessly
the
blossom
of
flame
sprang
into
being
where
once
had
been
the
leviathan
of
space
viewplates
throughout
the
fleet
suddenly
blacked
out
in
protection
against
that
terrible
overload
when
they
came
on
again
they
showed
the
drifting
helpless
hulk
of
the
rear
third
of
the
ship
the
immediate
objective
had
been
accomplished
the
disruptor
beams
vanished
as
the
eighteen
ships
converged
upon
the
black
hulks
to
take
off
any
possible
survivors
underwood
seized
the
moment
and
diffused
his
powers
until
he
encompassed
the
fleet
he
spoke
and
his
voice
found
hearing
in
every
man
of
those
mighty
ships
men
of
earth
you
have
sworn
allegiance
to
demarzule
the
sirenian
because
of
his
might
now
you
will
swear
allegiance
to
might
that
is
great
enough
to
wipe
demarzule
from
the
face
of
civilization
i
have
killed
your
fellows
right
in
your
midst
and
destroyed
two
of
your
mightiest

yet
none

you
have
seen
me
you
know
not
how
i
come
into

nor
how
it
is
that
every
man
of
every

can
hear
my
voice
at
once
you
have
betrayed
your
kind
to
an
alien
who
has
destroyed
worlds
and
ruined

you
are
guilty
of
the
highest
treason
to

what
is
there
that
you
can
do
to
wipe
out
such
infamy
you
can
join
the

that
will
wipe
out
the

demarzule
you
can
accept
the
leadership
of
greater

or
be
destroyed
choose
there
was
a
moment
of
stunned
quiet
within
the
ships
then
a
bedlam
that
would
not
die
for
many
minutes
underwood
withdrew
from
the
fleet
and
returned
to
the
control
room
of
the
there
he
found
a
chaos
of
despair
mason
had
properly
diagnosed
the
weapons
the
fleet
had
turned
upon
the
ship
though
his
physical
self
lay
in
the
sick
bay
yet
the
members
of
the
crew
were
becoming
accustomed
to
his
unexpected
voice
in
their
minds
quickly
he
told
them
what
he
had
done
when
he
finished
he
said
what
damage
did
you
suffer
if
any
mason
only
two
very
doubtful
generators
left
we
could
stand
another
blast
like
that
where
did
they
get
such
machines
i
do
know
it
possibly
something
toshmere
was
on
the
edge
of
developing
perhaps
some
of
our
own
men
have
worked
it
out
with
clues
given
by
demarzule
there
no
telling
the
important
thing
now
is
that
we
got
a
bear
by
the
tail
for
a
moment
we
have
the
upper
hand
but
i
not
sure
just
what
will
happen
when
they
pull
themselves
together
again
if
they
do
accept
my
ultimatum
we
may
be
in
a
spot
and
if
they
do
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
a
whole
fleet
of
fanatics
and
dupes
we
need
every
ally
that
we
can
get
now
undoubtedly
word
was
flashed
back
to
earth
of
this
disaster
before
i
talked
to
them
demarzule
knows
we
coming
and
is
aware
of
the
power
i
have
undoubtedly
send
powerful
interceptors
to
wipe
us
out
if
we
can
gain
control
of
these
ships
we
can
throw
them
against
his
interceptors
and
maybe
sneak
through
the
terrestrian
defenses
it
does
matter
what
happens
to
every
one
of
us
just
so
i
can
get
close
enough
to
demarzule
to
tangle
with
him
at
that
moment
captain
dawson
approached
mason
message
from
the
fleet
they
offer
to
surrender
unconditionally
auxiliary
engines
were
removed
from
the
hulk
of
the
destroyed
flagship
installed
in
the
they
could
easily
bring
her
speed
up
to
that
of
the
fastest
ship
in
the
fleet
so
with
the
small
laboratory
ship
as
flagship
the
ravaged
and
reorganized
fleet
turned
once
again
toward
earth
as
the
long
days
in
space
passed
while
they
sped
earthward
at
incredible
velocities
the
physicists
and
engineers
turned
the
into
a
deadly
warship
the
equal
of
any
in
their
fleet
new
and
more
powerful
atom
stream
projectors
were
installed
and
massive
disruptor
units
were
built
into
previous
areas
of
more
peaceful
uses
and
while
they
hurled
through
the
vault
of
space
underwood
moved
from
ship
to
ship
by
means
of
his
senses
testing
examining
and
filtering
out
the
men
of
the
battle
crews
if
he
could
have
afforded
pity
all
he
possessed
would
have
been
expended
upon
them
for
they
were
a
pitiable
lot
he
knew
that
their
standards
of
values
had
been
scattered
again
by
their
defeat
at
his
hands
if
their
belief
in
the
invincibility
of
demarzule
and
themselves
because
they
were
the
disciples
of
demarzule
had
not
been
so
great
their
defeat
would
have
been
less
easy
underwood
was
thankful
for
the
conceit
that
rendered
them
vulnerable
when
defeat
hove
in
sight
their
allegiance
to
him
was
no
stable
thing
he
knew
but
most
of
them
were
willing
to
throw
their
loyalties
with
the
scientists
because
they
hungered
for
leadership
with
a
neurotic
longing
and
the
power
that
could
silently
and
unseen
wipe
out
two
of
the
great
one
warships
was
surely
a
power
to
command
their
respect
so
they
reasoned
in
their
bewildered
minds
underwood
removed
from
the
key
places
those
who
were
doubtful
and
rebellious
and
he
spoke
to
them
daily
throughout
the
long
voyage
sometimes
reasoning
sometimes
commanding
but
always
with
a
display
of
power
that
they
had
to
respect
in
the
end
he
felt
he
had
a
set
of
crews
as
trustworthy
as
earthmen
could
be
made
in
this
culture
of
doubt
and
universal
disregard
of
trust
and
honesty
he
practised
constantly
in
perfecting
the
powers
of
the
and
as
his
facility
grew
so
did
his
regard
for
the
little
offshoot
of
dragboran
culture
that
had
flourished
upon
the
barren
little
moon
such
powers
as
he
possessed
would
have
meant
suicide
to
his
own
race
sometimes
he
wondered
if
he
could
himself
endure
their
temptations
long
enough
to
accomplish
his
goal
certainly
with
that
completed
he
would
have
the
organs
removed
their
call
to
power
wealth
and
the
misappropriation
were
almost
more
than
any
human
mind
in
this
stage
of
evolution
could
endure
almost
in
earth
own
front
yard
at
the
orbit
of
mars
the
first
signs
of
the
coming
struggle
appeared
the
lookout
called
his
warning
a
score
of
fast
interceptors
were
leaving
earth
headed
in
their
direction
underwood
wished
that
he
paid
more
attention
to
the
military
arts
he
dared
trust
none
of
the
warriors
who
were
his
by
conquest
for
he
could
not
appear
to
be
less
than
they
in
any
respect
but
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
other
scientists
were
competent
to
lead
a
complex
military
unit
such
as
his
fleet
represented
into
the
vortex
of
battle
yet
he
must
do
what
had
to
be
done
he
formed
the
fleet
into
a
massive
tactical
cylinder
with
the
at
the
center
and
the
remainder
of
the
ships
at
the
periphery
there
would
be
no
fancy
maneuvering
only
blunt
smashing
force
every
erg
of
it
that
could
be
generated
within
the
hulls
of
those
warships
the
entropy
dissipators
were
already
at
work
absorbing
a
fraction
of
the
momentum
that
had
carried
the
fleet
across
the
reaches
of
space
but
as
it
drove
into
the
heart
of
the
solar
system
its
velocity
was
still
immeasurable
by
solarian
standards
the
interceptors
were
powerless
to
match
that
speed
in
so
short
a
time
but
one
wave
approached
on
a
near
collision
course
with
the
fury
of
all
its
disruptors
and
atom
streams
bearing
upon
the
fleet
the
effect
was
negligible
however
as
the
fleet
smashed
by
its
own
weapons
flaming
but
that
passage
meant
nothing
if
the
were
to
attempt
a
landing
it
could
continue
to
hurl
by
at
such
velocities
for
already
it
was
passing
earth
underwood
though
was
satisfied
as
he
opened
his
physical
eyes
in
the
control
room
and
abandoned
the
senses
for
a
return
to
his
normal
self
i
sure
my
useful
range
with
these
powers
is
at
least
eighty
thousand
miles
jandro
ought
to
have
been
able
to
examine
the
dragboran
planet
by
means
of
the
but
maybe
he
did
realize
it
i
know
that
my
own
range
is
increasing
constantly
what
do
you
intend
to
do
asked
terry
are
you
going
to
try
a
landing
or
attack
demarzule
without
going
down
i
believe
we
be
safer
to
remain
in
space
if
we
can
maneuver
into
an
orbit
of
fifty
thousand
miles
or
so
from
earth
and
can
hold
off
the
attacks
long
enough
for
me
to
find
demarzule
that
ought
to
be
our
greatest
chance
of
success
if
we
landed
we
be
sitting
ducks
there
was
general
agreement
with
underwood
estimate
though
no
one
aboard
the
ship
felt
very
much
confidence
in
their
ability
to
hold
off
the
attacks
they
knew
were
coming
they
kept
reminding
themselves
that
it
was
not
important
to
save
themselves
or
their
ships
what
mattered
to
give
underwood
an
adequate
opportunity
to
hurl
the
powers
of
the
weapons
at
demarzule
after
that
chance
would
have
to
take
care
of
the
rest
the
hurtling
projectile
turned
long
after
it
had
passed
earth
the
entropy
dissipators
absorbed
the
flaming
energy
of
the
ships
flight
and
dispersed
it
into
space
to
recreate
the
infinitesimal
particles
that
had
been
broken
down
to
obtain
that
energy
so
as
the
fleet
braked
its
momentum
and
turned
into
an
spiral
the
interceptors
swept
down
once
more
the
thundering
mass
that
was
the
fleet
held
its
course
now
torrents
of
energy
slashed
from
the
hearts
of
incalculable
numbers
of
atoms
washed
into
space
from
the
throats
of
the
great
radiators
aboard
the
battleships
three
of
the
interceptors
went
down
in
that
barrage
before
their
own
force
shields
went
up
it
became
a
fantastic
battle
between
almost
irresistible
forces
both
the
atom
stream
and
the
disruptor
beams
could
be
fired
only
through
a
hiatus
in
the
force
shell
but
such
an
opening
was
itself
vulnerable
to
the
enemy
fire
of
atom
streams
therefore
the
technique
of
warfare
between
similarly
armed
forces
consisted
of
rapidly
shifting
the
attack
from
radiator
to
radiator
in
a
given
vessel
so
that
no
single
opening
would
exist
long
enough
for
the
enemy
to
concentrate
fire
upon
that
spot
the
interceptors
were
too
small
to
mount
the
equipment
for
such
defense
tactics
their
only
value
lay
in
maneuverability
slashing
across
the
lanes
of
the
battleships
their
beams
could
cross
the
radiator
pattern
in
unpredictable
courses
the
laws
of
chance
were
sometimes
with
them
and
their
atom
streams
struck
an
opening
directly
regardless
of
the
speed
of
closing
the
hiatus
such
a
coincidence
was
sufficient
to
destroy
the
ship
and
so
underwood
and
his
companions
watching
saw
one
of
their
great
battleships
explode
in
a
nova
of
atomic
fire
as
such
a
hit
was
scored
upon
it
the
interceptor
itself
was
fired
an
instant
later
by
the
concentrated
fire
of
the
two
adjacent
battleships
but
its
loss
was
negligible
to
the
enemy
the
interceptors
were
expendable
expendable
for
now
another
score
were
seen
leaving
the
rim
of
earth
and
taking
up
the
pursuit
of
the
fleet
but
it
was
not
their
approach
that
caused
the
hearts
of
the
men
aboard
the
to
quail
behind
them
slowly
and
ponderously
rose
a
terrible
fleet
of
fifty
dreadnaughts
with
vast
firepower
what
our
orbital
radius
at
present
underwood
demanded
abruptly
of
the
navigator
sixty
thousand
take
it
mason
underwood
said
i
going
down
the
impact
of
that
moment
hit
them
all
though
they
had
been
trying
to
anticipate
it
since
they
had
first
known
that
it
would
come
it
was
not
their
regard
and
friendship
for
underwood
who
might
presently
die
before
their
eyes
it
was
not
their
own
almost
extinction
before
the
fire
of
the
invincible
fleet
rising
to
do
battle
it
was
that
this
moment
would
decide
the
course
of
man
history
everything
depended
upon
a
single
strange
weapon
snatched
from
the
hands
of
a
forgotten
people
in
a
little
eddy
of
civilization
whose
sole
purpose
in
existence
might
have
been
to
carry
this
weapon
through
time
to
this
moment
and
only
one
of
them
could
wield
that
weapon
while
the
others
stood
by
neither
knowing
the
progress
of
that
conflict
nor
able
to
assist
underwood
sat
down
in
the
deep
chair
that
would
hold
his
body
restfully
while
his
senses
swept
earthward
to
envelop
and
crush
the
anachronism
that
he
had
turned
upon
civilization
it
was
more
than
just
more
than
ironic
he
thought
it
was
his
high
privilege
to
wipe
out
some
of
the
guilt
that
he
knew
he
could
never
smother
or
rationalize
out
of
his
mind
the
guilt
of
having
been
the
one
to
bring
demarzule
back
to
life
of
them
all
in
that
control
room
only
illia
uttered
a
sound
and
hers
was
a
half
audible
cry
choked
back
before
it
was
fully
spoken
he
lay
apparently
relaxed
with
eyes
closed
in
the
huge
chair
in
the
control
room
of
the
but
the
essence
the
force
that
was
delmar
underwood
was
sixty
thousand
miles
away
hovering
over
the
force
shell
dome
that
hid
the
carlson
museum
simultaneously
with
illia
cry
there
came
a
smashing
alarm
that
rang
through
the
room
with
its
insistent
murderous
message
we
hit
number
three
and
four
shell
generators
have
gone
out
as
underwood
held
to
the
point
of
view
of
the
advancing
of
perception
he
had
the
sensation
of
diving
headlong
toward
the
throng
that
was
gathering
as
if
by
magic
about
the
white
shining
columns
of
the
building
as
if
knowing
of
the
battle
that
was
to
be
fought
between
the
titans
the
waiting
thousands
had
gathered
when
the
force
shell
went
over
the
carlson
and
the
battle
fleets
took
to
space
they
watched
waiting
for
the
unknown
the
unexpected
somehow
sensing
their
destiny
was
being
decided
sight
of
the
milling
thousands
was
lost
to
underwood
as
he
plunged
deep
below
the
protecting
shell
over
the
building
as
if
it
did
not
exist
the
lightlessness
inside
the
shell
was
broken
by
the
blaze
of
lights
that
showered
their
radiance
everywhere
upon
the
grounds
and
museum
that
had
become
a
monstrous
palace
waiting
hesitant
guards
and
servants
moved
about
the
grounds
gathering
in
knots
to
ask
one
another
what
the
appearance
of
the
battleships
and
the
sudden
use
of
the
shell
meant
it
was
inconceivable
that
anyone
should
be
challenging
the
great
one
but
the
very
improbability
of
it
filled
them
with
fearful
dismay
underwood
entered
the
building
the
vast
assemblage
of
instruments
and
machines
that
had
filled
the
main
hall
when
he
last
saw
it
was
gone
now
replaced
with
rich
paintings
and
fabulous
tapestries
had
been
ransacked
from
the
treasuries
of
the
earth
there
was
no
one
in
sight
underwood
continued
on
until
he
came
to
the
series
of
large
exhibition
rooms
toward
the
rear
here
apparently
were
set
up
administrative
offices
to
maintain
whatever
personal
contact
was
necessary
between
demarzule
and
the
disciples
he
ruled
then
underwood
came
to
the
central
room
at
the
rear
of
the
center
section
of
the
building
demarzule
was
there
it
was
with
an
involuntary
shock
that
underwood
saw
again
the
alien
creature
he
had
restored
to
life
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
in
the
center
of
one
wall
of
the
room
the
great
one
seemed
like
some
sculpture
of
an
ancient
god
of
evil
executed
in
weathered
bronze
only
the
startling
white
of
his
eyes
gave
evidence
of
life
in
that
enormous
bulk
underwood
had
expected
the
twenty
earthmen
who
sat
near
demarzule
forming
a
with
the
great
one
in
the
center
as
if
in
council
they
sat
in
brooding
silence
not
a
word
seemed
to
be
passing
between
them
and
underwood
watched
in
wonderment
then
slowly
demarzule
stirred
his
white
staring
eyes
moved
as
though
searching
the
room
his
words
came
to
underwood
so
you
have
come
at
last
he
said
you
challenge
demarzule
the
great
one
with
your
feeble
powers
i
know
you
delmar
underwood
they
tell
me
it
was
you
who
found
and
restored
me
i
owe
you
much
and
i
would
have
offered
you
a
high
place
in
my
realm
which
shall
encompass
the
universe
yet
you
set
yourself
against
me
i
am
merciful
you
may
still
have
your
place
if
you
choose
i
need
one
such
as
you
just
as
i
needed
the
brain
and
hands
of
toshmere
who
was
so
foolish
as
to
think
he
could
be
the
one
to
conquer
the
eons
in
my
place
you
know
of
his
fate
i
am
sure
demarzule
speech
was
a
paralyzing
shock
underwood
had
made
no
revelation
of
himself
yet
the
alien
had
detected
his
presence
through
the
he
sensed
the
might
and
power
of
demarzule
the
full
potentialities
that
lay
in
the
three
organs
that
the
ancient
race
had
developed
potentialities
that
he
had
scarcely
touched
in
the
short
weeks
of
experimentation
it
made
him
sick
for
an
instant
with
the
fear
of
almost
certain
defeat
then
he
struck
furiously
and
with
all
the
power
that
was
in
him
never
before
had
he
hurled
such
a
bolt
of
devastation
with
satisfaction
he
sensed
demarzule
powers
sway
and
wither
before
its
blast
but
the
great
one
absorbed
it
and
recovered
after
an
instant
you
are
a
worthy
opponent
said
demarzule
you
have
accomplished
much
in
so
short
a
time
but
not
enough
i
fear
once
more
i
extend
my
offer
to
join
me
as
my
lieutenant
you
might
become
governor
of
many
galaxies
underwood
remained
silent
conserving
his
forces
for
another
blast
which
demarzule
could
surely
not
endure
he
hurled
it
and
felt
the
energies
flowing
from
him
in
a
stream
bronze
face
was
only
smiling
sardonically
as
he
met
that
attack
and
absorbed
it
when
you
have
exhausted
yourself
thoroughly
he
said
i
shall
demonstrate
my
own
powers
but
slowly
so
that
death
will
not
be
too
quick
for
you
the
use
of
such
waves
of
force
was
exhausting
to
underwood
but
he
knew
that
demarzule
absorptive
organ
should
soon
reach
maximum
capacity
if
it
were
not
allowed
to
drain
away
in
the
meantime
a
third
time
he
blasted
then
sudden
terrible
realization
came
that
demarzule
was
not
absorbing
the
energy
it
was
being
diverted
drawn
aside
before
it
even
approached
the
sirenian
in
something
approaching
panic
underwood
directed
his
senses
to
locate
the
source
of
the
diversion
and
found
it
in
the
twenty
earthmen
sitting
motionlessly
about
demarzule
demarzule
seemed
to
know
the
instant
that
underwood
became
aware
of
the
fact
yes
he
said
we
have
duplicated
the
cancer
is
plentiful
among
you
in
five
thousand
more
years
you
would
have
stopped
fighting
it
and
learned
how
to
use
it
there
are
twenty
of
us
you
would
not
have
come
had
you
known
you
would
have
that
many
to
fight
singlehanded
would
you
now
it
is
too
late
with
that
word
a
wave
of
paralyzing
destroying
force
swept
over
underwood
how
it
was
affecting
him
what
senses
it
was
attacking
he
did
not
know
he
only
knew
that
a
flaming
agony
was
burning
out
life
as
if
reluctant
to
give
him
a
speedy
merciful
death
he
must
withdraw
to
the
ship
to
recover
his
forces
he
could
never
withstand
the
attack
of
underwood
relaxed
and
threw
his
powers
back
toward
the
ship
and
failed
abruptly
the
metallic
glint
of
demarzule
lips
parted
in
a
roar
of
laughter
without
merriment
but
of
triumph
no
my
brave
earthling
you
can
not
retreat
you
did
not
know
that
for
those
who
would
challenge
the
great
one
there
is
no
retreat
your
decision
is
made
and
you
will
fail
and
you
will
die
but
only
when
i
wish
and
your
fellow
earthmen
will
find
amusement
in
toying
with
you
as
a
cat
with
a
mouse
before
i
give
the
final
blow
that
will
destroy
your
rash
impatient
ego
the
flaming
fire
of
demarzule
attack
continued
while
underwood
fought
savagely
and
vainly
to
retreat
how
was
he
being
held
there
against
his
efforts
to
retreat
he
did
not
know
that
the
held
such
powers
and
he
would
not
have
known
how
to
exert
them
himself
if
he
had
been
aware
of
them
he
gave
up
and
turned
back
letting
the
power
flow
into
the
absorptive
cells
of
the
but
it
could
not
be
for
long
for
the
organ
would
disrupt
under
such
stress
then
as
if
in
keeping
with
his
promise
to
prolong
the
agony
the
attack
ceased
and
demarzule
allowed
him
to
rest
you
were
brash
were
you
not
he
taunted
how
could
you
dare
come
against
the
mightiest
power
of
the
universe
the
greatest
mind
ever
created
and
attack
with
your
puny
powers
you
blaspheme
the
great
one
by
your
presumption
once
long
ago
said
underwood
the
sirenian
forces
were
defeated
by
the
dragbora
again
it
is
the
dragbora
you
face
demarzule
remember
that
and
defend
yourself
underwood
was
startled
incredibly
it
seemed
that
he
had
not
spoken
those
words
but
rather
that
the
dead
jandro
was
with
him
silently
backing
him
teaching
advising
he
lashed
out
but
not
at
demarzule
he
struck
swiftly
at
the
nearest
earthman
almost
instantly
the
unfortunate
shuddered
and
fell
to
the
floor
dead
in
quick
succession
underwood
struck
at
the
nerve
cells
of
the
next
five
and
they
died
without
sound
in
snarling
fury
and
retaliation
demarzule
retaliated
underwood
absorbed
the
blow
and
incredibly
hurled
it
back
it
was
as
if
he
had
suddenly
become
aware
of
techniques
that
he
had
never
dreamed
of
he
had
not
known
it
was
possible
to
absorb
the
force
with
his
own
and
whip
it
back
upon
the
attacker
like
a
ball
caught
and
thrown
it
hardly
seemed
as
if
he
were
acting
through
his
own
volition
yet
he
acted
he
felt
the
surprise
of
demarzule
and
in
that
moment
he
knew
the
secret
the
earthmen
apparently
possessed
only
a
single
primitive
organ
hardly
identifiable
as
one
of
the
for
they
had
the
capacity
for
defense
but
not
for
attack
four
more
of
them
toppled
and
then
underwood
was
forced
to
face
the
attack
of
demarzule
again
something
like
terror
had
entered
the
mind
of
the
alien
now
underwood
sensed
the
thoughts
of
possible
defeat
that
flooded
demarzule
mind
remember
that
day
on
underwood
asked
remember
how
the
dragboran
powers
pierced
the
great
force
shell
you
flung
about
the
planet
remember
how
your
men
fell
one
by
one
and
their
weapons
went
cold
and
the
force
shell
dropped
for
lack
of
control
remember
demarzule
it
was
the
dragbora
you
fought
that
day
and
it
is
the
dragbora
you
fight
now
i
have
not
come
to
challenge
as
a
puny
earthman
i
come
as
a
dragboran
to
complete
the
unfinished
task
of
my
ancestors
the
sirenian
was
silent
and
new
confidence
filled
underwood
he
felt
that
he
was
not
fighting
alone
that
all
of
the
ancient
dragboran
civilization
was
behind
him
battling
its
enemies
to
extinction
he
felt
as
if
jandro
himself
were
there
the
energy
he
absorbed
from
demarzule
he
turned
upon
the
cohorts
who
sat
as
if
frozen
with
fear
as
they
watched
their
fellows
slump
and
fall
to
the
floor
in
soundless
death
in
demarzule
increased
his
attacks
he
adopted
a
shifting
feinting
attack
that
shocked
underwood
with
each
surging
wave
of
force
but
underwood
learned
how
to
control
those
surges
to
pass
them
on
to
his
own
attacks
which
still
were
directed
upon
the
earthmen
within
the
chamber
within
moments
of
each
other
the
last
two
on
either
side
of
demarzule
fell
the
sirenian
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
for
all
his
energies
and
concentration
now
were
directed
at
underwood
underwood
was
tiring
swiftly
the
energies
draining
out
of
him
seemed
as
if
they
were
sapping
every
cell
of
his
being
and
back
on
board
the
every
spasm
of
torture
was
reflected
involuntarily
on
his
physical
face
those
who
watched
suffered
for
him
illia
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
room
opposite
him
and
her
fists
pressed
white
spots
into
her
cheeks
dreyer
nervous
reaction
was
expressed
in
the
incessant
puffs
and
chewing
on
his
normally
steady
cigar
the
others
merely
watched
with
taut
faces
and
teeth
sinking
into
their
lips
in
the
chamber
of
the
great
museum
palace
the
tempo
of
the
battle
was
slowly
building
up
though
he
felt
exhausted
almost
to
the
point
of
defeat
underwood
strained
for
more
energy
and
found
that
it
was
at
his
command
his
fed
upon
the
attacking
force
of
demarzule
and
returned
it
with
added
energy
potential
in
each
of
them
the
same
process
was
going
on
and
the
outcome
would
be
determined
by
the
final
resultant
flow
of
destroying
power
he
could
retreat
now
underwood
realized
he
doubted
that
demarzule
could
exert
a
holding
force
upon
him
but
nothing
would
be
gained
by
abandoning
the
battle
now
he
drove
on
with
increasing
surges
suddenly
there
was
a
faltering
and
underwood
exulted
within
himself
demarzule
force
wavered
for
the
barest
fraction
of
an
instant
and
it
was
not
a
feint
you
are
old
and
weak
said
underwood
half
a
million
years
ago
civilization
rejected
you
reject
you
he
smashed
on
almost
without
hindrance
now
demarzule
great
form
writhed
in
pain
upon
the
throne
and
fought
with
one
desperate
surge
of
energy
underwood
caught
and
hurled
it
back
mercilessly
he
felt
his
way
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
sirenian
mind
groped
along
the
nerve
ways
of
the
great
one
and
as
he
went
he
burned
and
destroyed
the
vital
synapses
demarzule
was
dying
slowly
because
of
his
resistance
and
in
endless
pain
because
there
was
no
other
way
he
screamed
aloud
in
ultimate
agony
and
then
the
giant
figure
of
demarzule
the
sirenian
the
great
one
crashed
to
the
floor
the
relief
that
came
to
underwood
was
near
agony
the
wild
forces
of
the
dragbora
tore
relentlessly
from
him
and
filled
the
room
with
their
lethal
energy
before
they
died
then
in
greater
calm
he
regarded
what
he
had
done
it
was
finished
almost
unbelievably
finished
yet
there
were
a
few
things
to
do
he
left
the
building
and
sought
out
the
guards
and
the
caretakers
and
whispered
into
their
minds
demarzule
is
dead
the
great
one
has
died
and
you
are
men
once
more
he
sought
out
the
controls
of
the
force
shell
and
caused
the
operator
to
drop
the
shield
then
he
whispered
the
great
one
is
dead
and
like
the
wind
his
voice
encompassed
the
vast
thousands
who
had
gathered
the
message
sank
unspoken
into
their
minds
and
each
man
looked
at
his
neighbor
as
if
to
ask
how
it
had
come
they
pressed
forward
a
battling
maddened
mob
who
had
for
an
hour
lived
in
a
childish
primitive
world
where
men
were
not
required
to
think
but
only
to
obey
they
pushed
forward
and
flowed
into
the
building
battering
clawing
one
another
but
they
managed
to
view
the
body
of
the
fallen
sirenian
so
that
the
message
was
confirmed
and
spread
soon
to
circle
the
earth
underwood
studied
the
writhing
bewildered
mass
could
dreyer
possibly
be
right
would
it
ever
end
men
unthinking
grasping
for
leadership
their
mindless
search
for
kings
and
gods
while
within
them
their
own
powers
withered
always
it
had
been
the
same
leaders
arose
holding
before
men
the
illusion
of
vast
glorious
promises
while
they
carefully
led
them
into
hells
of
lost
dreams
and
broken
promises
yes
it
would
be
different
underwood
told
himself
the
dragbora
had
proved
that
it
could
be
different
their
origin
could
have
been
no
less
lowly
than
man
they
must
have
trodden
the
same
tortuous
stairway
to
dreams
that
man
was
now
on
and
they
had
learned
how
to
live
with
one
another
man
was
already
nearer
that
goal
far
nearer
now
that
demarzule
was
dead
underwood
formed
a
silent
prayer
that
fate
would
be
merciful
to
man
and
not
send
another
like
demarzule
and
he
allowed
himself
a
moment
pride
an
instant
of
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
he
had
been
able
to
take
part
in
the
crisis
with
a
final
pity
for
the
scene
below
he
fled
back
into
space
what
he
saw
there
turned
him
sick
with
fear
the
great
fleet
was
broken
and
burned
with
atomic
fires
only
two
of
the
battleships
remained
to
challenge
the
attackers
but
they
were
no
longer
challenging
they
signalled
abject
surrender
and
were
fallen
upon
by
ravenous
interceptors
the
herself
was
darkened
and
drifting
her
force
shell
feeble
and
waning
while
the
flaming
disruptors
of
a
trio
of
dreadnaughts
concentrated
upon
her
underwood
hurled
himself
toward
the
nearest
of
the
enemy
ships
in
its
depths
he
sought
out
the
gunners
and
cut
off
life
in
them
before
they
were
aware
of
his
bodiless
presence
swiftly
he
turned
their
beams
upon
each
other
and
watched
them
wallow
and
disappear
in
sudden
flame
others
rushed
forward
now
still
more
than
a
score
of
them
to
defeat
the
single
crippled
laboratory
ship
more
than
he
could
hope
to
conquer
in
time
but
they
did
not
fire
their
shields
remained
intact
then
slowly
their
courses
changed
and
they
drifted
away
without
comprehension
underwood
peered
into
those
hulls
and
knew
the
answer
the
news
had
come
to
them
of
demarzule
death
like
men
in
pursuit
of
a
mirage
they
could
not
endure
the
reality
that
came
with
the
vanishing
of
their
dream
their
defeat
was
utter
and
complete
throughout
the
earth
demarzule
defeat
was
the
defeat
of
all
men
who
had
not
yet
become
strong
enough
to
walk
in
the
sun
of
their
own
decisions
but
clung
to
the
shadow
of
illusory
leadership
underwood
swept
back
toward
the
darkened
he
moved
like
a
ghost
through
its
bleak
halls
and
vacant
corridors
down
in
the
generator
rooms
he
found
the
cause
of
the
disaster
in
the
blasted
remains
of
overburdened
force
shell
generators
four
of
them
must
have
given
way
at
once
ripping
the
ship
throughout
its
length
with
concussion
and
lethal
waves
the
control
room
was
dark
like
the
rest
of
the
ship
and
the
forms
of
his
companions
were
strewn
upon
the
floor
but
there
was
life
yet
and
he
dared
to
hope
as
he
spoke
to
their
minds
insistent
commanding
forcing
life
and
consciousness
back
into
their
nerve
cells
he
seemed
to
become
aware
of
unknown
powers
of
resurrection
that
dwelt
within
his
own
being
his
mission
was
complete
he
returned
to
his
own
physical
form
and
abandoned
the
senses
he
sat
there
in
the
huge
chair
in
the
control
room
while
those
about
him
revived
and
life
gradually
returned
to
the
dying
ship
of
the
enemy
fleet
there
was
no
more
for
it
was
descending
to
an
earth
shorn
of
the
hope
of
conquest
they
did
not
know
yet
where
they
would
go
or
where
they
could
find
refuge
but
when
the
wreckage
was
cleared
and
the
ship
lived
again
underwood
and
illia
stood
alone
in
a
darkened
observation
pit
watching
the
stars
slip
across
the
massive
arc
of
the
screens
as
underwood
watched
he
thought
he
sensed
something
of
the
drive
that
might
have
whipped
demarzule
brain
the
goad
that
made
vast
superior
powers
intolerable
in
the
possession
of
even
a
beneficent
man
for
he
would
no
longer
remain
beneficent
by
the
might
that
was
in
him
he
had
vanquished
the
great
one
he
could
stand
in
the
place
of
the
great
one
if
he
chose
he
did
not
know
if
his
powers
were
becoming
greater
than
those
of
jandro
like
a
strengthened
plant
in
new
soil
but
surely
they
were
growing
the
secrets
of
the
universe
seemed
to
be
appearing
before
him
one
by
one
a
mere
glance
at
a
slab
of
inert
matter
and
his
senses
could
delve
into
the
composition
of
its
atoms
and
sort
out
and
predict
its
properties
and
reactions
one
look
into
the
far
spaces
beyond
the
solar
system
and
he
could
sense
himself
soaring
in
eternity
yes
he
was
growing
in
power
and
perception
and
where
it
might
lead
he
dared
not
look
but
there
were
other
things
to
be
had
other
simpler
ambitions
in
which
common
men
had
found
fulfillment
throughout
the
ages
illia
was
warm
against
him
soft
in
his
arms
i
want
you
to
operate
again
as
quickly
as
possible
he
said
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
start
what
do
you
mean
you
must
take
out
the
organs
they
served
their
purpose
i
do
want
to
live
with
them
i
could
become
another
demarzule
with
the
power
i
have
her
eyes
were
faintly
blue
in
the
light
that
came
from
the
panel
and
they
were
intent
upon
him
in
them
he
read
something
that
made
him
afraid
there
is
always
a
need
for
men
with
greater
powers
and
greater
knowledge
than
the
average
man
she
said
the
race
has
need
of
its
mutants
they
are
dealt
so
sparingly
to
us
that
we
can
not
afford
not
to
utilize
them
you
are
a
true
mutant
whether
artificial
or
not
possessing
organs
and
abilities
that
are
unique
the
race
needs
them
you
can
not
ask
me
to
destroy
them
he
had
never
thought
of
himself
as
a
mutant
yet
she
was
right
for
all
practical
purposes
his
powers
and
perceptions
would
perhaps
not
have
been
produced
naturally
in
any
man
of
his
race
for
thousands
of
years
to
come
perhaps
he
use
them
to
assist
man
slow
rise
a
new
wealth
of
science
a
new
strength
of
leadership
and
guidance
if
necessary
i
could
become
the
world
greatest
criminal
he
said
there
no
secret
no
property
that
safe
from
my
grasp
i
have
only
to
reach
out
for
possessions
for
power
you
worry
too
much
about
that
she
said
lightly
you
could
no
more
become
a
villain
than
i
could
why
are
you
so
sure
of
that
do
you
remember
the
properties
of
the
but
then
you
did
hear
the
last
words
that
jandro
ever
spoke
did
you
he
said
retire
to
the
do
you
know
what
that
means
suddenly
underwood
felt
cold
a
score
of
whisperings
came
thundering
into
his
mind
the
moment
when
he
had
first
awakened
from
the
operation
when
it
seemed
as
if
death
would
have
him
and
only
the
power
of
a
demanding
will
had
helped
him
cling
to
life
the
voice
that
seemed
to
penetrate
and
call
him
back
the
voice
of
jandro
and
then
the
final
conflict
in
the
chambers
of
demarzule
new
skills
and
new
strength
had
suddenly
come
to
him
as
if
out
of
nowhere
he
had
been
conceited
to
call
it
his
increased
experience
and
ability
yet
could
it
have
come
from
outside
himself
he
sought
frantically
and
urgently
within
his
own
nerve
channels
in
the
cells
of
his
own
being
and
in
the
pathways
of
the
alien
organs
that
lent
him
those
unearthly
senses
there
seemed
nothing
but
an
echo
as
if
within
a
great
empty
hall
there
was
no
answer
yet
it
seemed
as
if
down
those
channels
of
perception
there
was
the
dim
shadow
of
a
wary
prey
who
could
never
be
caught
who
could
never
be
found
in
those
endless
pathways
but
who
would
never
be
far
away
underwood
knew
then
that
if
it
was
jandro
he
would
never
make
himself
known
for
reasons
of
his
own
perhaps
but
there
was
a
sudden
peace
as
if
he
had
found
some
secret
purification
as
if
he
had
been
taken
to
a
high
place
and
looked
about
the
world
and
had
been
able
to
turn
his
back
upon
it
whether
he
would
ever
find
jandro
or
not
he
was
sure
that
the
guardian
was
there
illia
was
saying
i
ca
operate
del
even
if
you
hate
me
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
i
wo
do
it
and
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
world
who
would
know
how
you
would
be
killed
if
you
let
anyone
else
attempt
to
cut
those
nerves
tell
me
that
you
believe
i
right
i
do
he
said
in
cheerful
resignation
but
do
forget
it
half
your
funeral
as
well
it
means
that
you
going
to
have
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
with
a
mutant

turned
her
face
up
to
his

of

fates
