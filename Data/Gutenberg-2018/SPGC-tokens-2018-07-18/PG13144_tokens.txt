social
history
sometimes
suffers
from
the
reproach
that
it
is
vague
and
general
unable
to
compete
with
the
attractions
of
political
history
either
for
the
student
or
for
the
general
reader
because
of
its
lack
of
outstanding
personalities
in
point
of
fact
there
is
often
as
much
material
for
reconstructing
the
life
of
some
quite
ordinary
person
as
there
is
for
writing
a
history
of
robert
of
normandy
or
of
philippa
of
hainault
and
the
lives
of
ordinary
people
so
reconstructed
are
if
less
spectacular
certainly
not
less
interesting
i
believe
that
social
history
lends
itself
particularly
to
what
may
be
called
a
personal
treatment
and
that
the
past
may
be
made
to
live
again
for
the
general
reader
more
effectively
by
personifying
it
than
by
presenting
it
in
the
form
of
learned
treatises
on
the
development
of
the
manor
or
on
medieval
trade
essential
as
these
are
to
the
specialist
for
history
after
all
is
valuable
only
in
so
far
as
it
lives
and
maeterlinck
cry
are
no
dead
should
always
be
the
historian
motto
it
is
the
idea
that
history
is
about
dead
people
or
worse
still
about
movements
and
conditions
which
seem
but
vaguely
related
to
the
labours
and
passions
of
flesh
and
blood
which
has
driven
history
from
bookshelves
where
the
historical
novel
still
finds
a
welcome
place
in
the
following
series
of
sketches
i
have
tried
to
illustrate
at
the
same
time
various
aspects
of
social
life
in
the
middle
ages
and
various
classes
of
historical
material
thus
bodo

peasant
life
and
an
early
phase
of
a
typical

in

they
are
all
quite
ordinary
people
and
unknown
to
fame
with
the
exception
of
marco

the
types
of
historical
evidence

are

at
the
end
of
the
book
i
have
added
a
bibliography
of
the
sources
which
form
the
raw
material
for
my
reconstructions
and
a
few
additional
notes
and
references
i
hope
that
this
modest
attempt
to
bring
to
life
again
some
of
fathers
that
begat
us
may
perhaps
interest
for
an
hour
or
two
the
general
reader
or
the
teacher
who
wishes
to
make
more
concrete
by
personification
some
of
the
general
facts
of
medieval
social
and
economic
history
my
thanks
are
due
to
my
publishers
methuen
and
for
allowing
me
to
incorporate
in
chapter
vi
the
greater
part
of
a
chapter
in
my
book
paycockes
of
coggeshall
and
to
the
cambridge
university
press
for
similarly
allowing
me
to
repeat
in
chapter
iii
a
few
sentences
from
my
study
of
english
nunneries
i
have
also
to
thank
my
friends
miss
jones
and
miss
murray
of
girton
college
cambridge
for
various
suggestions
and
criticisms
and
my
sister
miss

for
making

to
the

years
after
the
first
edition
of
had
come
out
eileen
power
collected
notes
and
made
plans
for
several
essays
to
be
included
in
an
enlarged
edition
of
the
book
of
these
essays
only
one
the
precursors
had
been
written
out
in
full
before
she
died
and
it
has
now
been
added
to
the
present
edition
in
its
published
form
it
is
not
in
every
respect
identical
with
the
author
original
text
the
essay
was
taking
shape
as
munich
came
and
went
and
as
the
war
itself
was
drawing
near
no
historian
writing
at
that
time
about
rome
menaced
by
the
barbarians
and
least
of
all
an
historian
as
sensitive
to
the
world
as
eileen
power
was
could
have
helped
noting
the
similarities
between
the
roman
empire
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
centuries
and
europe
in
the
in
the
end
having
finished
the
essay
she
decided
to
withold
it
from
publication
for
the
time
being
and
to
present
it
instead
to
a
friendly
audience
as
a
tract
for
the
times
this
she
did
at
a
meeting
of
the
cambridge
history
club
in
the
winter
of
and
for
that
occasion
she
replaced
the
opening
and
concluding
pages
of
the
original
essay
with
passages
or
rather
notes
for
passages
more
suited
to
the
purpose
i
am
sure
that
she
never
intended
these
passages
to
be
perpetuated
in
her
and
i
have
therefore
done
what
i
could
to
replace
them
with
a
reconstructed
version
of
her
first
draft
the
reconstruction
had
to
be
done
from
somewhat
disjointed
notes
and
can
not
therefore
be
the
readers
must
therefore
bear
in
mind
that
the
first
two
and
the
last

the

chapter
i
rome
in
decline
every
schoolboy
knows
that
the
middle
ages
arose
on
the
ruins
of
the
roman
empire
the
decline
of
rome
preceded
and
in
some
ways
prepared
the
rise
of
the
kingdoms
and
cultures
which
composed
the
medieval
system
yet
in
spite
of
the
truth
of
this
historical
preposition
we
know
little
about
life
and
thought
in
the
watershed
years
when
europe
was
ceasing
to
be
roman
but
was
not
yet
medieval
we
do
not
know
how
it
felt
to
watch
the
decline
of
rome
we
do
not
even
know
whether
the
men
who
watched
it
knew
what
they
saw
though
we
can
be
quite
certain
that
none
of
them
foretold
indeed
could
have
foreseen
the
shape
which
the
world
was
to
take
in
later
centuries
yet
the
tragic
story
its
main
themes
and
protagonists
were
for
all
to
see
no
observer
should
have
failed
to
notice
that
the
roman
empire
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
was
no
longer
the
roman
empire
of
the
great
antonine
and
augustan
age
that
it
had
lost
its
hold
over
its
territories
and
its
economic
cohesion
and
was
menaced
by
the
barbarians
who
were
in
the
end
to
overwhelm
it
the
territory
of
the
roman
empire
had
at
its
height
stretched
from
the
lands
bordering
the
north
sea
to
the
lands
on
the
northern
fringes
of
the
sahara
and
from
the
atlantic
coast
of
europe
to
the
central
asiatic
steppes
it
comprised
most
of
the
regions
of
the
former
hellenic
iranian
and
phoenician
empires
and
it
either
ruled
or
kept
in
check
great
clusters
of
peoples
and
principalities
beyond
its
gallic
and
north
african
frontiers
from
these
farthest
frontiers
rome
of
the
fourth
century
had
retreated
and
was
still
retreating
within
its
frontiers
great
currents
of
commerce
had
in
earlier
centuries
flowed
along
the
routes
which
bound
all
the
provinces
of
the
empire
to
rome
and
most
of
the
provinces
to
each
other
but
from
the
third
century
onwards
the
economic
unity
of
the
empire
was
in
dissolution
and
by
the
fifth
century
most
of
the
great
currents
of
trade
had
ceased
to
flow
and
provinces
and
districts
had
been
thrown
upon
themselves
and
their
own
resources
and
with
the
wealth
of
the
provinces
reduced
their
commerce
restricted
the
great
provincial
cities
also
declined
in
population
wealth
political
power
yet
to
its
very
last
days
the
empire
endeavoured
to
defend
its
frontiers
against
the
converging
barbarians
not
only
did
the
barbarian
conquests
like
all
conquests
threaten
destruction
and
ruin
but
the
way
of
life
the
barbarians
stood
for
was
the
very
denial
of
what
roman
civilization
had
been
though
alas
was
gradually
ceasing
to
be
however
it
was
not
in
material
things
that
the
contemporaries
found
or
should
have
found
the
sharpest
conflict
between
rome
and
the
barbarian
prospects
before
it
above
all
roman
civilization
was
a
civilization
of
the
mind
it
had
behind
it
a
long
tradition
of
thought
and
of
intellectual
achievement
the
legacy
of
greece
to
which
it
had
in
turn
made
its
own
contribution
the
roman
world
was
a
world
of
schools
and
universities
writers
and
builders
the
barbarian
world
was
a
world
in
which
mind
was
in
its
infancy
and
its
infancy
was
long
the
battle
sagas
of
the
race
which
have
all
but
disappeared
or
have
survived
only
as
legends
worked
up
in
a
later
age
the
few
rude
laws
which
were
needed
to
regulate
personal
relationships
this
was
hardly
civilization
in
the
roman
sense

to
make
verses
in
the
style

he
could

distinguish
between

and
a
short
and
they
all
hobbled
charlemagne
himself
going
to

with

slate
under
his

in

watches

that
art
of
writing
which
he
never
mastered
what
have
they
in
common
with
julius
caesar
and
marcus
aurelius
and
that
great
julian
called
the
apostate
they
sum
up
in
their
very
persons
the
whole
wide
gulf
that
yawned
between
germany
and
rome
rome
and
the
barbarians
were
thus
not
only
protagonists
but
two
different
attitudes
to
life
civilization
and
barbarism
we
can
not
here
discuss
in
detail
the
question
as
to
why
in
the
clash
between
the
two
it
was
civilization
which
perished
and
barbarism
which
prevailed
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
while
the
empire
tried
to
defend
its
frontiers
against
the
barbarian
hosts
it
gradually
opened
them
to
barbarian
settlers
this
peaceful
infiltration
of
barbarians
which
altered
the
whole
character
of
the
society
which
it
invaded
would
have
been
impossible
of
course
if
that
society
had
not
been
stricken
by
disease
the
disease
is
plain
enough
to
see
by
the
third
century
it
shows
itself
in
those
internecine
civil
wars
in
which
civilization
rends
itself
province
against
province
and
army
against
army
it
shows
itself
in
the
great
inflationary
crisis
from
about
and
in
the
taxation
which
gradually
crushed
out
the
smaller
bourgeoisie
while
the
fortunes
of
the
rich
escaped
its
net
it
shows
itself
in
the
gradual
sinking
back
of
an
economy
based
upon
free
exchange
into
more
and
more
primitive
conditions
when
every
province
seeks
to
be
and
barter
takes
the
place
of
trade
it
shows
itself
in
the
decline
of
farming
and
in
the
workless
city
population
kept
quiet
by
their
dole
of
bread
and
their
circuses
whose
life
contrasted
so
dramatically
so
terribly
with
that
of
the
haughty
senatorial
families
and
the
great
landowners
in
their
palatial
villas
and
town
houses
it
shows
itself
in
the
rise
of
mystical
faiths
on
the
ruins
of
philosophy
and
of
superstition
more
especially
astrology
on
the
ruins
of
reason
one
religion
in
particular
grew
mighty
by
clasping
its
sacred
book
and
addressing
itself
with
words
of
hope
to
the
victims
of
social
injustice
but
although
it
was
able
to
bring
comfort
to
individuals
it
could
do
nothing
indeed
it
did
not
try
to
give
new
strength
or
inspiration
to
the
embattled
civilization
true
to
its
own
ethos
it
was
impartial
as
between
barbarian
and
roman
or
between
the
romans
who
prospered
and
ruled
and
those
outside
the
pale
the
most
obvious
manifestation
of
roman
society
in
decline
was
the
dwindling
numbers
of
roman
citizens
the
empire
was
being
depopulated
long
before
the
end
of
the
period
of
peace
and
prosperity
which
stretched
from
augustus
to
marcus
aurelius
does
not
augustus
himself
summon
the
poor
man
of
fiesole
who
has
a
family
of
eight
children
grandchildren
and
eighteen
great
grandchildren
and
organize
in
his
honour
a
fête
in
the
capitol
accompanied
by
a
great
deal
of
publicity
does
not
tacitus
and
describing
the
noble
savage
with
his
eye
on
fellow
citizens
remark
that
among
the
germans
it
is
accounted
a
shameful
thing
to
limit
the
number
of
your
children
the
long
duration
of
augustus
legislation
to
raise
the
birthrate
is
significant
successful
it
was
not
but
the
fact
that
it
was
maintained
on
the
statute
book
and
systematically
revised
and
developed
for
three
centuries
shows
that
it
was
at
least
accounted
necessary
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
mortality
rate
was
a
far
more
important
factor
in
those
days
than
it
is
in
our
own
and
the
mortality
from
pestilence
and
civil
war
from
marcus
aurelius
onwards
was
exceptional
and
it
is
plain
that
the
proportion
of
celibates
was
high
in
the
roman
empire
and
that
the
fall
in
the
fertility
of
marriages
was
going
on
it
is
the
childless
marriage
the
small
family
system
that
contemporary
writers
deplore
in
seeley
striking
phrase
human
harvest
was
bad
it
was
bad
in
all
classes
but
the
decline
was
most
marked
in
the
upper
ranks
the
most
educated
the
most
civilized
the
potential
leaders
of
the
race
in
the
terrible
words
of
swift
facing
his
own
madness
the
roman
empire
might
have
cried
shall
die
like
a
tree
from
the
top
downwards
why
the
insistent
question
forces
itself
did
this
civilization
lose
the
power
to
reproduce
itself
was
it
as
polybius
said
because
people
preferred
amusements
to
children
or
wished
to
bring
their
children
up
in
comfort
hardly
for
it
is
more
marked
among
the
rich
than
the
poor
and
the
rich
can
have
the
best
of
both
worlds
was
it
because
people
had
grown
discouraged
and
disheartened
no
longer
believing
in
their
own
civilization
and
loath
to
bring
children
into
the
darkness
and
disaster
of
their
world
we
do
not
know
but
we
can
see
the
connection
of
the
falling
population
with
the
other
evils
of
the
empire
the
heavy
cost
of
administration
relatively
heavier
when
the
density
of
the
population
is
low
the
empty
fields
the
dwindling
legions
which
did
not
suffice
to
guard
the
frontier
to
cure
this
sickness
of
population
the
roman
rulers
knew
no
other
way
than
to
dose
it
with
barbarian
vigour
just
a
small
injection
to
begin
with
and
then
more
and
more
till
in
the
end
the
blood
that
flowed
in
its
veins
was
not
roman
but
barbarian
in
came
the
germans
to
settle
the
frontier
to
till
the
fields
to
enlist
first
in
the
auxiliaries
and
then
in
the
legions
to
fill
the
great
offices
of
state
the
army
is
barbarized
and
a
modern
writer
mr
moss
has
quoted
most
effectively
the
complaint
of
the
egyptian
mother
clamouring
to
get
back
her
son
who
as
she
says
has
gone
off
with
the
barbarians
he
means
that
he
has
enlisted
in
the
roman
legions
the
legions
are
barbarized
and
they
barbarize
the
emperor
for
them
he
is
no
longer
the
majestic
embodiment
of
law
he
is
their
leader
their
führer
and
they
raise
him
on
their
shields
and
side
by
side
with
the
barbarization
of
the
army
goes
the
barbarization
of
civil
manners
too
in
honorius
has
to
pass
an
edict
forbidding
the
wearing
of
german
fashions
within
the
precincts
of
rome
and
in
the
end
half
barbarian
themselves
they
have
only
barbarians
to
defend
them
against
barbarism
such
was
the
general
picture
of
the
great
ruin
of
civilization
amidst
which
the
romans
of
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
centuries
lived
what
then
did
it
feel
like
to
live
at
a
time
when
civilization
was
going
down
before
the
forces
of
barbarism
did
people
realize
what
was
happening
did
the
gloom
of
the
dark
ages
cast
its
shadow
before
it
so
happens
that
we
can
answer
these
questions
very
clearly
if
we
fix
our
eyes
on
one
particular
part
of
the
empire
the
famous
and
highly
civilized
province
of
gaul
we
can
catch
the
decline
at
three
points
because
in
three
consecutive
centuries
writers
have
left
us
a
picture
of
their
life
and
times
in
the
fourth
century
we
have
ausonius
in
the
fifth
sidonius
apollinarius
in
the
sixth
gregory
of
tours
and
fortunatus
a
stranger
from
italy
who
made
his
home
in
poitiers
they
show
us
auvergne
and
the
bordelais
in
the
evening

the
fifth
and
the
sixth
centuries
going

ausonius

this
is
the
world
of
ausonius
france
in
the
latter
half
of
the
fourth
century
indian
summer
between
ages
of
storm
and
wreckage
ausonius
himself
is
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
the
friend
alike
of
the
pagan
symmachus
and
of
st
paulinus
of
nela
he
is
for
thirty
years
professor
of
rhetoric
in
the
university
of
bordeaux
for
some
time
tutor
to
a
prince
praetorian
prefect
of
gaul
consul
and
in
his
last
years
just
an
old
man
contentedly
living
on
his
estates
his
most
famous
poem
is
a
description
of
the
moselle
which
for
all
its
literary
affectations
evokes
most
magically
the
smiling
countryside
which
was
the
background
of
his
life
high
above
the
river
on
either
bank
stand
the
villas
and
country
houses
with
their
courts
and
lawns
and
pillared
porticos
and
the
hot
baths
from
which
if
you
will
you
can
plunge
into
the
stream
the
sunny
hillside
is
covered
with
vines
and
from
slope
to
the
husbandmen
call
to
each
other
and
the
wayfarer
on
the
towpath
or
the
bargemen
floating
by
shout
their
rude
jests
to
the
loitering
vinedressers
far
out
in
midstream
the
fisherman
trails
his
dripping
net
and
on
a
rock
by
the
shore
the
angler
plies
his
rod
and
as
twilight
falls
the
deepening
shadow
of
the
green
hillside
is
reflected
in
the
water
and
gazing
downward
the
boatman
can
almost
count
the
trembling
vines
and
almost
see
the
swelling
of
the
grapes
equally
peaceful
equally
pleasant
is
life
on
ausonius
own
estate
in
the
bordelais
his
little
patrimony
he
calls
it
although
he
had
a
thousand
acres
of
vineyard
and
tillage
and
wood
miss
waddell
has
reminded
us
on
the
authority
of
saintsbury
whom
else
that
this
day
it
boasts
itself
as
one
of
the
two
best
of
the
st
emilion
clarets
here
he
tends
his
roses
and
sends
his
boy
round
to
the
neighbours
to
bid
them
to
luncheon
while
he
interviews
the
cook
six
including
the
host
is
the
right
number
if
more
it
is
not
a
meal
but
a
melée
then
there
are
all
his
relatives
to
be
commemorated
in
verse
his
grandfather
and
his
grandmother
and
his
sisters
and
his
cousins
and
his
aunts
especially
his
aunts
and
when
the
family
circle
palls
there
is
the
senior
common
room
to
fall
back
upon
and
the
professors
of
bordeaux
to
be
celebrated
in
their
turn
professors
were
important
people
in
the
empire
of
the
fourth
century
symmachus
says
that
it
is
the
mark
of
a
flourishing
state
that
good
salaries
should
be
paid
to
professors
though
what
exactly
we
are
to
deduce
from
that
in
the
light
of
history
i
should
hesitate
to
say
so
ausonius
writes
a
collection
of
poems
about
the
professors
of
bordeaux
there
are
of
them
and
all
are
celebrated
there
is
minervius
the
orator
who
had
a
prodigious
memory
and
after
a
game
of
backgammon
was
wont
to
conduct
a
over
every
move
there
is
anastasius
the
grammarian
who
was
so
foolish
as
to
leave
bordeaux
for
a
provincial
university
and
thenceforth
languished
in
obscurity
there
is
attius
tiro
delphidius
who
retired
from
a
legal
career
into
the
professorial
chair
but
could
never
be
got
to
take
any
trouble
with
his
men
to
the
disappointment
of
their
parents
there
is
jocundus
the
grammarian
who
did
not
really
deserve
his
title
but
was
such
a
kind
man
that
we
will
commemorate
him
among
men
of
worth
although
he
was
strictly
speaking
unequal
to
the
job
there
is
exuperius
who
was
very
and
whose
eloquence
sounded
superb
until
you
examined
it
and
found
that
it
meant
nothing
there
is
dynamius
who
slipped
from
the
paths
of
virtue
with
a
married
lady
in
bordeaux
and
left
the
place
rather
hastily
but
fortunately
fell
on
his
feet
in
spain
there
is
victorius
the
usher
who
liked
only
the
most
abstruse
historical
problems
such
as
what
the
pedigree
of
the
sacrificial
priest
at
cureo
was
long
before
numa
day
or
what
castor
had
to
say
on
all
the
shadowy
kings
and
who
never
got
up
as
far
as
tully
or
virgil
though
he
might
have
done
so
if
he
had
gone
on
reading
long
enough
but
death
cut
him
off
too
soon
they
seem
oddly
familiar
figures
except
of
course
dynamius
and
their
chronicler
contrives
to
make
them
live
such
is
the
world
depicted
for
us
by
ausonius
but
while
this
pleasant
country
house
and
senior
common
room
life
was
going
calmly
on
what
do
we
find
happening
in
the
history
books
ausonius
was
a
man
of
nearly
fifty
when
the
germans
swarmed
across
the
rhine
in
pillaging
flourishing
cities
and
pitching
their
camps
on
the
banks
of
the
moselle
he
had
seen
the
great
julian
take
up
arms
plato
plato
what
a
task
for
a
philosopher
and
in
a
series
of
brilliant
campaigns
drive
them
out
again
ten
years
later
when
he
was
tutor
to
gratian
he
had
himself
accompanied
the
emperor
valentinian
on
another
campaign
against
the
same
foes
while
he
was
preening
himself
on
his
consulship
ten
years
later
still
he
must
have
heard
of
the
disastrous
battle
of
adrianople
in
the
east
when
the
goths
defeated
a
roman
army
and
slew
an
emperor
he
died
in
and
within
twelve
years
of
his
death
the
host
of
germans
had
burst
across
the
rhine
gaul
was
a
smoking
funeral
pyre
and
the
goths
were
at
the
gates
of
rome
and
what
have
ausonius
and
his
correspondents
to
say
about
this
not
a
word
ausonius
and
symmachus
and
their
set
ignore
the
barbarians
as
completely
as
the
novels
of
jane
austen
ignore
the
napoleonic
wars
sidonius
apollinaris
going
going
some
years
after
the
death
of
ausonius
in
the
midst
of
the
disastrous
sixth
century
was
born
sidonius
apollinaris
aristocrat
of
an
emperor
sometime
prefect
of
rome
and
in
the
end
bishop
of
clermont
sidonius
apollinaris
or
thereabouts
to
or
perhaps
a
few
years
later
much
had
happened
between
the
death
of
ausonius
and
his
birth
the
lights
were
going
out
all
over
europe
barbarian
kingdoms
had
been
planted
in
gaul
and
spain
rome
herself
had
been
sacked
by
the
goths
and
in
his
lifetime
the
collapse
went
on
ever
more
swiftly
he
was
a
young
man
of
twenty
when
the
ultimate
horror
broke
upon
the
west
the
inroad
of
attila
and
the
huns
that
passed
away
but
when
he
was
the
vandals
sacked
rome
he
saw
the
terrible
german
ricimer
throne
and
unthrone
a
series
of
puppet
emperors
he
saw
the
last
remnant
of
gallic
independence
thrown
away
and
himself
become
a
barbarian
subject
and
he
saw
a
few
years
before
he
died
the
fall
of
the
empire
in
the
west
they
can
not
sidonius
and
his
friends
ignore
as
ausonius
and
his
friends
did
that
something
is
happening
to
the
empire
the
men
of
the
fifth
century
are
concerned
at
these
disasters
and
they
console
themselves
each
according
to
his
kind
there
are
some
who
think
it
can
not
last
after
all
they
say
the
empire
has
been
in
a
tight
place
before
and
has
always
got
out
of
it
in
the
end
and
risen
supreme
over
its
enemies
thus
sidonius
himself
the
very
year
after
they
sacked
the
city
rome
has
endured
as
much
before
there
was
porsenna
there
was
brennus
there
was
hannibal
only
that
time
rome
did
not
get
over
it
others
tried
to
use
the
disasters
to
castigate
the
sins
of
society
thus
salvian
of
marseilles
who
would
no
doubt
have
been
called
the
gloomy
dean
if
he
had
not
been
a
bishop
for
him
all
that
the
decadent
roman
civilization
needs
is
to
copy
some
of
the
virtues
of
these
fresh
young
barbarian
people
there
is
the
familiar
figure
of
orosius
defending
the
barbarians
with
the
argument
that
when
the
roman
empire
was
founded
it
was
founded
in
blood
and
conquest
and
can
ill
afford
to
throw
stones
at
the
barbarians
and
after
all
the
barbarians
are
not
so
bad
the
unhappy
people
they
have
despoiled
will
content
themselves
with
the
little
that
is
left
them
their
conquerors
will
cherish
them
as
friends
and
brothers
others
especially
the
more
thoughtful
churchmen
are
much
concerned
to
explain
why
an
empire
which
had
flourished
under
paganism
should
be
thus
beset
under
christianity
others
desert
the
empire
altogether
and
like
st
augustine
put
their
hope
in
a
city
not
made
with
hands
though
ambrose
it
is
true
let
fall
the
pregnant
observation
that
it
was
not
the
will
of
god
that
his
people
should
be
saved
by
has
not
pleased
god
to
save
his
people
by
dialectic
and
how
were
they
living
we
have
only
to
read
the
letters
written
by
sidonius
during
the
period
between
and
when
he
was
living
on
his
estate
in
auvergne
to
realize
that
on
the
surface
all
is
going
on
exactly
as
before
gaul
is
shrunk
it
is
true
to
a
mere
remnant
between
three
barbarian
kingdoms
but
save
for
that
we
might
be
back
in
the
days
of
ausonius
there
is
the
luxurious
villa
with
its
hot
baths
and
swimming
pool
its
suites
of
rooms
its
views
over
the
lake
and
there
is
sidonius
inviting
his
friends
to
stay
with
him
or
sending
round
his
compositions
to
the
professors
and
the
bishops
and
the
sport
and
games
are
very
popular
sidonius
rides
and
swims
and
hunts
and
plays
tennis
in
one
letter
he
tells
his
correspondent
that
he
has
been
spending
some
days
in
the
country
with
his
cousin
and
an
old
friend
whose
estates
adjoin
each
other
they
had
sent
out
scouts
to
catch
him
and
bring
him
back
for
a
week
and
took
it
in
turns
to
entertain
him
there
are
games
of
tennis
on
the
lawn
before
breakfast
or
backgammon
for
the
older
men
there
is
an
hour
or
two
in
the
library
before
we
sit
down
to
an
excellent
luncheon
followed
by
a
siesta
then
we
go
out
riding
and
return
for
a
hot
bath
and
a
plunge
in
the
river
i
should
like
to
describe
our
luscious
dinner
parties
he
concludes
but
i
have
no
more
paper
however
come
and
stay
with
us
and
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
clearly
this
is
no
britain
where
in
the
sixth
century
people
camped
in
the
abandoned
villas
and
cooked
their
food
on
the
floors
of
the
principal
rooms
and
yet
it
had
gone
a
long
way
downhill
since
the
days
of
ausonius
and
sidonius
could
not
now
ignore
the
very
existence
of
the
barbarians
he
has
indeed
left
notable
protraits
of
them
especially
of
the
king
of
the
visigoths
and
of
the
burgundians
who
ruled
lyons
where
he
was
born
whenever
he
went
to
stay
there
he
complains
they
flocked
about
him
in
embarrassing
friendliness
breathing
leeks
and
onions
and
dressing
their
hair
with
rancid
butter
they
were
not
it
appears
constrained
to
choose
between
spears
and
butter
how
can
he
compose
six
foot
metres
he
asks
with
so
many
seven
foot
patrons
around
him
all
singing
and
all
expecting
him
to
admire
their
uncouth
stream
of
words
the
shrug
of
the
shoulder
the
genial
contempt
of
one
conscious
of
an
infinite
superiority
how
clear
it
is
one
is
reminded
of
a
verse
of
verlaine
je
suis
a
la
fin
de
la
decadence
qui
regarde
passer
les
grands
barbares
blancs
but
sidonius
good
nature
was
to
be
rudely
shaken
all
barbarians
were
not
friendly
giants
and
the
visigoths
next
door
under
their
new
king
euric
turned
covetous
eyes
upon
auvergne
sidonius
had
not
been
two
years
bishop
of
clermont
before
he
had
to
organize
the
defence
of
the
city
against
their
attack
the
avernians
stood
out
gallantly
they
would
fight
and
they
would
starve
but
they
would
defend
this
last
stronghold
of
rome
in
gaul
but
they
were
a
small
people
to
resist
successfully
they
must
have
help
from
rome
itself
lest
anyone
should
suspect
me
of
twisting
the
story
i
give
it
in
the
words
of
sidonius
editor
writing
twenty
years
ago
julius
nepos
was
alive
to
the
danger
that
euric
might
cross
the
rhône
but
weak
as
his
resources
were
he
could
only
hope
to
secure
peace
by
negotiation
the
quaestor
licinianus
had
been
sent
into
gaul
to
investigate
the
condition
of
affairs
on
the
spot
he
had
now
returned
and
it
was
soon
only
too
clear
that
hopes
based
on
his
intervention
were
not
likely
to
be
fulfilled
we
find
sidonius
writing
for
information
he
began
to
fear
that
something
was
going
on
behind
his
back
and
that
the
real
danger
to
auvergne
came
no
longer
from
determined
enemies
but
from
pusillanimous
friends
his
suspicions
were
only
too
well
founded
on
receipt
of
the
quaestor
report
a
council
was
held
to
determine
the
policy
of
the
empire
towards
the
visigothic
king
the
empire
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
support
auvergne
and
it
was
decided
to
cede
the
whole
territory
to
euric
apparently
without
condition
the
despair
of
sidonius
knew
no
bounds
and
he
writes
a
nobly
indignant
letter
to
a
bishop
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
negotiations
the
state
of
our
unhappy
region
is
miserable
indeed
everyone
declares
that
things
were
better
in
wartime
than
they
are
now
after
peace
has
been
concluded
our
enslavement
was
made
the
price
of
security
for
a
third
party
the
enslavement
ah
the
shame
of
it
of
those
avernians
who
in
our
own
time
stood
forth
alone
to
stay
the
advance
of

these
are
the
men
whose
common
soldiers
were
as
good
as
captains
but
who
never
reaped
the
benefit
of
their
victories
that
was
handed
over
for
your
consolation
while
all
the
crushing
burden
of
defeat
they
had
to
bear
themselves
this
is
to
be
our
reward
for
braving
destitution
fire
sword
and
pestilence
for
fleshing
our
swords
in
the
enemy
blood
and
going
ourselves
starved
into

this
is
the
famous
peace
we
dreamed
of
when
we
tore
the
grass
from
the
crannies
in
the
walls
to
eat
for
all
these
proofs
of
our
devotion
it
would
seem
that
we
are
to
be
made
a
sacrifice
if
it
be
so
may
you
live
to
blush
for
a
peace
without
either
honour
or
advantage
auvergne
had
been
sacrificed
to
save
rome
but
rome
was
not
to
enjoy
her
peace
with
honour
for
long
these
things
took
place
in
and
in
the
last
emperor
was
desposed
by
his
barbarian
and
the
empire
in
the
west
came
to
an
end
as
for
sidonius
the
goths
imprisoned
him
for
a
time
and
before
he
could
recover
his
estate
he
had
to
write
a
panegyric
for
king
euric
he
who
had
written
panegyrics
for
three
roman
emperors
it
is
clear
that
the
old
country
house
life
went
on
as
before
though
the
men
who
exchanged
letters
and
epigrams
were
now
under
barbarian
rule
but
in
one
letter
shortly
before
his
death
there
breaks
from
sidonius
a
single
line
in
which
he
unpacks
his
heart
neccessitas
abjecta
nascendi
vivendi
misera
dura
humiliating
necessity
of
birth
sad
necessity
of
living
hard
necessity
of
dying
shortly
after
he
died
and
within
twenty
years
clovis
had
embarked
upon
his
career
of
conquest
and
theodoric
was
ruler
of
italy
fortunatus
and
gregory
of
tours
going
going
gone
there
is
only
the
time
and
only
the
heart
to
look
for
a
moment
at
the
frankish
kingdom
which
once
was
gaul
and
to
survey
the
world
of
fortunatus
and
gregory
of
tours
born
both
of
them
just
about
a
century
later
than
sidonius
in
the
for
a
moment
when
you
look
at
fortunatus
you
think
the
world
of
the
sixth
century
is
the
same
world
as
that
in
which
sidonius
entertained
his
friends
with
epigrams
and
tennis
fortunatus
that
versatile
gentle
genial
gourmet
who
somehow
managed
to
write
two
of
the
most
magnificent
hymns
of
the
christian
church
came
from
italy
on
a
visit
to
gaul
in
and
never
left
it
again
he
travelled
all
over
the
frankish
lands
in
what
had
been
germania
as
well
as
in
what
had
been
gaul
from
trier
to
toulouse
he
made
his
way
with
ease
by
river
and
by
road
and
it
might
be
ausonius
again
fortunatus
too
writes
a
poem
on
the
moselle
and
there
is
the
same
smiling
countryside
with
terraced
vineyards
sloping
down
to
the
quiet
stream
and
the
smoke
of
villas
rising
from
the
woods
fortunatus
too
made
the
round
of
the
country
houses
especially
of
the
sumptuous
villas
belonging
to
leontius
bishop
of
bordeaux
a
great
aristocrat
whose
grandfather
had
been
a
friend
of
sidonius
the
hot
baths
the
pillared
porticos
the
lawns
sloping
to
the
river
are
all
there
the
feasts
are
even
more
magnificent
they
upset
fortunatus
digestion
badly
and
the
talk
is
still
of
literature
the
more
intelligent
of
the
barbarian
lords
have
imitated
this
refined
and
luxurious
life
as
best
they
may
the
franks
as
well
as
the
welcome
little
eager
fortunatus
every
count
wants
a
set
of
latin
verses
dedicated
to
himself
it
is
plain
that
some
of
the
old
country
house
life
at
least
has
survived
the
apollinaris
set
still
enjoys
its
hot
baths
and
its
tennis
as
dill
puts
it
the
barbarian
might
rule
the
land
but
the
laws
of
polite
society
would
be
administered
as
before
but
when
you
look
again
you
realize
that
it
is
not
the
same
it
is
not
merely
because
we
know
that
even
these
remnants
of
the
social
and
material
civilization
of
rome
would
soon
themselves
die
away
that
the
tragedy
of
the
sixth
century
looms
so
dark
it
is
because
when
we
look
below
the
surface
we
see
that
the
life
has
gone
out
of
it
all
the
soul
that
inflamed
it
is
dead
nothing
is
now
left
but
the
empty
shell
these
men
welcome
fortunatus
just
because
he
comes
from
italy
where
the
rot
has
gone
less
far
where
there
still
survives
some
reputation
for
learning
and
for
culture
they
slake
their
nostalgia
a
little
in
the
presence
of
that
of
a
lost
civilization
for
this
is
the
world
of
gregory
of
tours
of
which
you
may
read
in
his
of
the
the
rule
under
which
it
lives
is
the
rule
of
the
horrible
merovingian
kings
side
by
side
with
the
villas
barbarism
spreads
and
flourishes
like
a
jungle
growth
learning
is
dying
hardly
the
ghost
of
a
university
is
left
and
gregory
himself
who
came
of
a
great
family
and
was
a
bishop
bewails
his
ignorance
of
grammar
the
towns
are
shrinking
crouched
behind
their
defences
the
synagogues
are
flaming
and
the
first
step
has
been
taken
in
that
tragic
tale
of
proscription
and
tallage
tallage
and
expulsion
which
it
seems
must
never
end
as
to
politics
the
will
of
the
leader
and
his
retinue
is
the
rule
of
the
franks
and
purge
and
bloodbath
mark
every
stage
in
the
rivalry
of
the
merovingian
princes
the
worst
of
them
are
devils
like
chilperic
and
fredegond
the
best
of
them
are
still
barbarians
like
that
king
guntram
who
fills
so
many
indulgent
pages
in
gregory
of
tours
he
is
a
vaguely
contemporary
figure
a
fat
voluble
man
now
purring
with
jovial
good
nature
now
bursting
into
explosions
of
wrath
and
violence
a
strange
mixture
of
bonhomie
and
brutality
it
is
an
ironic
commentary
on
what
has
happened
to
civilization
that
gregory
should
regard
him
with
affection
that
he
should
be
known
as
king
guntram
and
that
the
church
should
actually
have
canonized
him
after
his
death
good
king
guntram
michelet
has
summed
him
up
in
a
phrase
bon
roi
à
qui
on
ne
reprochait
que
deux
ou
trois
meurtres
conclusion
these
were
the
men
who
lived
through
the
centuries
of
roman
fall
and
barbarian
triumph
and
who
by
virtue
of
their
elevated
position
their
learning
and
talents
should
have
seen
if
not
foretold
the
course
of
events
and
yet
as
one
contemplates
the
world
of
ausonius
and
sidonius
for
by
the
time
of
gregory
of
tours
it
was
already
dead
one
is
i
think
impelled
to
ask
oneself
the
question
why
they
were
apparently
so
blind
to
what
was
happening
the
big
country
houses
go
on
having
their
luncheon
and
tennis
parties
the
little
professors
in
the
universities
go
on
giving
their
lectures
and
writing
their
books
games
are
increasingly
popular
and
the
theatres
are
always
full
ausonius
has
seen
the
germans
overrun
gaul
once
but
he
never
speaks
of
a
danger
that
may
recur
sidonius
lives
in
a
world
already
half
barbarian
yet
in
the
year
before
the
western
empire
falls
he
is
still
dreaming
of
the
consulship
for
his
son
why
did
they
not
realize
the
magnitude
of
the
disaster
that
was
befalling
them
this
is
indeed
a
question
almost
as
absorbing
as
the
question
why
their
civilization
fell
for
it
is
perhaps
the
same
question
several
answers
may
be
suggested
in
explanation
in
the
first
place
the
process
of
disintegration
was
a
slow
one
for
the
whole
tempo
of
life
was
slow
and
what
might
take
decades
in
our
own
time
took
centuries
then
it
is
only
because
we
can
look
back
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
much
later
age
that
we
can
see
the
inexorable
pattern
which
events
are
forming
so
that
we
long
to
cry
to
these
dead
people
down
the
corridor
of
the
ages
warning
them
to
make
a
stand
before
it
is
too
late
hearing
no
answering
echo
heal
thyself
they
suffered
from
the
fatal
myopia
of
contemporaries
it
was
the
affairs
of
the
moment
that
occupied
them
for
them
it
was
the
danger
of
the
moment
that
must
be
averted
and
they
did
not
recognize
that
each
compromise
and
each
defeat
was
a
link
in
the
chain
dragging
them
over
the
abyss
at
what
point
did
barbarism
within
become
a
wasting
disease
yet
from
the
first
skinclad
german
taken
into
a
legion
to
the
great
barbarian
patricians
of
italy
making
and
unmaking
emperors
the
chain
is
unbroken
at
what
point
in
the
assault
from
without
did
the
attack
become
fatal
was
it
the
withdrawal
from
dacia
in
allow
the
barbarians
their
sphere
of
influence
in
the
east
of
europe
fling
them
the
recruit
to
romania
and
they
will
be
satiated
and
leave
the
west
alone
was
it
the
settlement
of
the
goths
as
within
the
empire
in
and
the
beginning
of
that
compromise
between
the
roman
empire
and
the
germans
which
as
bury
says
masked
the
transition
from
the
rule
of
one
to
the
rule
of
the
other
from
federate
states
within
the
empire
to
independent
states
replacing
it
was
this
policy
of
appeasement
the
fatal
error
was
it
the
removal
of
the
legions
from
britain
a
distant
people
as
a
roman
senator
might
have
said
of
whom
we
know
nothing
or
was
it
that
fatal
combination
of
spain
and
africa
when
the
vandals
ensconced
themselves
in
both
provinces
by
and
the
vandal
fleet
with
majorca
and
the
islands
for
its
bases
cut
off
rome
from
her
corn
supplies
and
broke
the
backbone
of
ancient
civilization
which
was
the
mediterranean
sea
not
once
alone
in
the
history
of
europe
has
the
triumph
of
a
hostile
rule
in
africa
and
spain
spelt
disaster
to
our
civilization
but
if
the
gradualness
of
this
process
misled
the
romans
there
were
other
and
equally
potent
reasons
for
their
blindness
most
potent
of
all
was
the
fact
that
they
mistook
entirely
the
very
nature
of
civilization
itself
all
of
them
were
making
the
same
mistake
people
who
thought
that
rome
could
swallow
barbarism
and
absorb
it
into
her
life
without
diluting
her
own
civilization
the
people
who
ran
about
busily
saying
that
the
barbarians
were
not
such
bad
fellows
after
all
finding
good
points
in
their
regime
with
which
to
castigate
the
romans
and
crying
that
except
ye
become
as
little
barbarians
ye
shall
not
attain
salvation
the
people
who
did
not
observe
in
that
one
half
of
the
respublica
romanorum
had
ceased
to
exist
and
nourished
themselves
on
the
fiction
that
the
barbarian
kings
were
exercising
a
power
delegated
from
the
emperor
all
these
people
were
deluded
by
the
same
error
the
belief
that
rome
the
civilization
of
their
age
was
not
a
mere
historical
fact
with
a
beginning
and
an
end
but
a
condition
of
nature
like
the
air
they
breathed
and
the
earth
they
tread
roma
most
magnificent
most
disastrous
of
creeds
the
fact
is
that
the
romans
were
blinded
to
what
was
happening
to
them
by
the
very
perfection
of
the
material
culture
which
they
had
created
all
around
them
was
solidity
and
comfort
a
material
existence
which
was
the
very
antithesis
of
barbarism
how
could
they
foresee
the
day
when
the
norman
chronicler
would
marvel
over
the
broken
hypocausts
of
caerleon
how
could
they
imagine
that
anything
so
solid
might
conceivably
disappear
their
roads
grew
better
as
their
statesmanship
grew
worse
and
central
heating
triumphed
as
civilization
fell
but
still
more
responsible
for
their
unawareness
was
the
educational
system
in
which
they
were
reared
ausonius
and
sidonius
and
their
friends
were
highly
educated
men
and
gaul
was
famous
for
its
schools
and
universities
the
education
which
these
gave
consisted
in
the
study
of
grammar
and
rhetoric
which
was
necessary
alike
for
the
civil
service
and
for
polite
society
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
an
education
more
entirely
out
of
touch
with
contemporary
life
or
less
suited
to
inculcate
the
qualities
which
might
have
enabled
men
to
deal
with
it
the
fatal
study
of
rhetoric
its
links
with
reality
long
since
severed
concentrated
the
whole
attention
of
men
of
intellect
on
form
rather
than
on
matter
the
things
they
learned
in
their
schools
had
no
relation
to
the
things
that
were
going
on
in
the
world
outside
and
bred
in
them
the
fatal
illusion
that
tomorrow
would
be
as
yesterday
that
everything
was
the
same
whereas
everything
was
different
so
we
take
our
leave
of
them
going
going
gone
gone
altogether
perhaps
not
hundreds
of
years
of
barbarism
were
to
elapse
before
a
new
society
arose
capable
of
matching
or
even
excelling
rome
in
material
wealth
in
arts
in
sciences
and
in
gentler
modes
of
existence
the
de
la
we
can
not
say
what
date
marked
the
moment
of
final
recovery
or
who
were
the
men
who
were
to
represent
advancing
civilization
as
fully
as
ausonius
or
gregory
of
tours
represented
civilization
in
retreat
dante
shakespeare
capernicus
newton
but
for
many
centuries
perhaps
a
whole
millennium
before
western
europe
scaled
the
heights
on
which
these
men
now
stood
it
had
been
gradually
raising
itself
from
the
depths
of
decline
the
ascent
was
not
only
slow
but
also
discontinuous
yet
it
was
sufficient
to
establish
within
a
few
centuries
of
gregory
of
tours
a
social
order
different
from
rome
and
less
glorious
to
behold
across
a
thousand
years
of
history
but
nevertheless
sufficiently
exalted
to
draw
the
interest
and
even
to
command
the
admiration
of
other
still
later
ages
in
that
culture
and
in
that
social
order
much
of
what
ausonius
and
sidonius
and
even
fortunatus
represented
was
brought
to
life
again
albeit
in
a
form
they
would
not
always
have
recognized
as
their
own
to
this
extent
at
least
they
were
not
only
the
epigones
of
rome
but
the

from
the
centuries
before
it
in
its
vivid
realization
of
that
person
the
man
in
the
street
or
as
it
was
more
often
in
the
earliest
ages
the
man
with
the
hoe
today
the
historian
is
interested
in
the
social
life
of
the
past
and
not
only
in
the
wars
and
intrigues
of
princes
to
the
modern
writer
the
fourteenth
century
for
instance
is
not
merely
the
century
of
the
hundred
years
war
and
of
the
black
prince
and
edward
iii
more
significantly
it
is
for
him
the
era
of
the
slow
decay
of
villeinage
in
england
a
fact
more
in
the
long
run
than
the
struggle
over
our
french
provinces
we
still
praise
famous
men
for
he
would
be
a
poor
historian
who
could
spare
one
of
the
great
figures
who
have
shed
glory
or
romance
upon
the
page
of
history
but
we
praise
them
with
due
recognition
of
the
fact
that
not
only
great
individuals
but
people
as
a
whole
unnamed
and
undistinguished
masses
of
people
now
sleeping
in
unknown
graves
have
also
been
concerned
in
the
story
our
fathers
that
begat
us
have
come
to
their
own
at
last
as
acton
put
it
great
historian
now
takes
his
meals
in
the
kitchen
this
book
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
kitchens
of
history
and
the
first
which
we
shall
visit
is
a
country
estate
at
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
it
so
happens
that
we
know
a
surprising
amount
about
such
an
estate
partly
because
charlemagne
himself
issued
a
set
of
orders
instructing
the
royal
stewards
how
to
manage
his
own
lands
telling
them
everything
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
know
down
to
the
vegetables
which
they
were
to
plant
in
the
garden
but
our
chief
source
of
knowledge
is
a
wonderful
estate
book
which
irminon
the
abbot
of
st
germain
des
prés
near
paris
drew
up
so
that
the
abbey
might
know
exactly
what
lands
belonged
to
it
and
who
lived
on
those
lands
very
much
as
william
i
drew
up
an
estate
book
of
his
whole
kingdom
and
called
it
in
this
estate
book
is
set
down
the
name
of
every
little
estate
or
as
it
was
called
belonging
to
the
abbey
with
a
description
of
the
land
which
was
worked
under
its
steward
to
its
own
profit
and
the
land
which
was
held
by
tenants
and
the
names
of
those
tenants
and
of
their
wives
and
of
their
children
and
the
exact
services
and
rents
down
to
a
plank
and
an
egg
which
they
had
to
do
for
their
land
we
know
today
the
name
of
almost
every
man
woman
and
child
who
was
living
on
those
little
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
and
a
great
deal
about
their
daily
lives
consider
for
a
moment
how
the
estate
upon
which
they
lived
was
organized
the
lands
of
the
abbey
of
st
germain
were
divided
into
a
number
of
estates
called
each
of
a
convenient
size
to
be
administered
by
a
steward
on
each
of
these
the
land
was
divided
into
seigniorial
and
tributary
lands
the
first
administered
by
the
monks
through
a
steward
or
some
other
officer
and
the
second
possessed
by
various
tenants
who
received
and
held
them
from
the
abbey
these
tributary
lands
were
divided
into
numbers
of
little
farms
called
manses
each
occupied
by
one
or
more
families
if
you
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
chief
or
seigniorial
manse
which
the
monks
kept
in
their
own
hands
you
would
have
found
a
little
house
with
three
or
four
rooms
probably
built
of
stone
facing
an
inner
court
and
on
one
side
of
it
you
would
have
seen
a
special
group
of
houses
hedged
round
where
the
women
serfs
belonging
to
the
house
lived
and
did
their
work
all
round
you
would
also
have
seen
little
wooden
houses
where
the
household
serfs
lived
workrooms
a
kitchen
a
bakehouse
barns
stables
and
other
farm
buildings
and
round
the
whole
a
hedge
carefully
planted
with
trees
so
as
to
make
a
kind
of
enclosure
or
court
attached
to
this
central
manse
was
a
considerable
amount
of
land
ploughland
meadows
vineyards
orchards
and
almost
all
the
woods
or
forests
on
the
estate
clearly
a
great
deal
of
labour
would
be
needed
to
cultivate
all
these
lands
some
of
that
labour
was
provided
by
servile
workers
who
were
attached
to
the
chief
manse
and
lived
in
the
court
but
these
household
serfs
were
not
nearly
enough
to
do
all
the
work
upon
the
monks
land
and
far
the
greater
part
of
it
had
to
be
done
by
services
paid
by
the
other
landowners
on
the
estate

ii
embarkation
of
the
polos
at
venice
beside
the
seigniorial
manse
there
were
a
number
of
little
dependent
manses
these
belonged
to
men
and
women
who
were
in
various
stages
of
freedom
except
for
the
fact
that
all
had
to
do
work
on
the
land
of
the
chief
manse
there
is
no
need
to
trouble
with
the
different
classes
for
in
practice
there
was
very
little
difference
between
them
and
in
a
couple
of
centuries
they
were
all
merged
into
one
common
class
of
medieval
villeins
the
most
important
people
were
those
called
who
were
personally
free
that
is
to
say
counted
as
free
men
by
the
law
but
bound
to
the
soil
so
that
they
could
never
leave
their
farms
and
were
sold
with
the
estate
if
it
were
sold
each
of
the
dependent
manses
was
held
either
by
one
family
or
by
two
or
three
families
which
clubbed
together
to
do
the
work
it
consisted
of
a
house
or
houses
and
farm
buildings
like
those
of
the
chief
manse
only
poorer
and
made
of
wood
with
ploughland
and
a
meadow
and
perhaps
a
little
piece
of
vineyard
attached
to
it
in
return
for
these
holdings
the
owner
or
joint
owners
of
every
manse
had
to
do
work
on
the
land
of
the
chief
manse
for
about
three
days
in
the
week
the
steward
chief
business
was
to
see
that
they
did
their
work
properly
and
from
every
one
he
had
the
right
to
demand
two
kinds
of
labour
the
first
was
every
year
each
man
was
bound
to
do
a
fixed
amount
of
ploughing
on
the
domain
land
as
it
was
called
later
on
and
also
to
give
what
was
called
a
that
is
to
say
an
unfixed
amount
of
ploughing
which
the
steward
could
demand
every
week
when
it
was
needed
the
distinction
corresponds
to
the
distinction
between
and
in
the
later
middle
ages
the
second
kind
of
labour
which
every
owner
of
a
farm
had
to
do
on
the
monks
land
was
called
handwork
that
is
to
say
he
had
to
help
repair
buildings
or
cut
down
trees
or
gather
fruit
or
make
ale
or
carry
loads
anything
in
fact
which
wanted
doing
and
which
the
steward
told
him
to
do
it
was
by
these
services
that
the
monks
got
their
own
seigniorial
farm
cultivated
on
all
the
other
days
of
the
week
these
tenants
were
free
to
cultivate
their
own
little
farms
and
we
may
be
sure
that
they
put
twice
as
much
elbow
grease
into
the
business
but
their
obligation
did
not
end
here
for
not
only
had
they
to
pay
services
they
also
had
to
pay
certain
rents
to
the
big
house
there
were
no
state
taxes
in
those
days
but
every
man
had
to
pay
an
army
due
which
charlemagne
exacted
from
the
abbey
and
which
the
abbey
exacted
from
its
tenants
this
took
the
form
of
an
ox
and
a
certain
number
of
sheep
or
the
equivalent
in
money
pays
to
the
host
two
shillings
of
silver
comes
first
on
every
freeman
list
of
obligations
the
farmers
also
had
to
pay
in
return
for
any
special
privileges
granted
to
them
by
the
monks
they
had
to
carry
a
load
of
wood
to
the
big
house
in
return
for
being
allowed
to
gather
firewood
in
the
woods
which
were
jealously
preserved
for
the
use
of
the
abbey
they
had
to
pay
some
hogsheads
of
wine
for
the
right
to
pasture
their
pigs
in
the
same
precious
woods
every
third
year
they
had
to
give
up
one
of
their
sheep
for
the
right
to
graze
upon
the
fields
of
the
chief
manse
they
had
to
pay
a
sort
of
of
a
head
in
addition
to
these
special
rents
every
farmer
had
also
to
pay
other
rents
in
produce
every
year
he
owed
the
big
house
three
chickens
and
fifteen
eggs
and
a
large
number
of
planks
to
repair
its
buildings
often
he
had
to
give
it
a
couple
of
pigs
sometimes
corn
wine
honey
wax
soap
or
oil
if
the
farmer
were
also
an
artisan
and
made
things
he
had
to
pay
the
produce
of
his
craft
a
smith
would
have
to
make
lances
for
the
abbey
contingent
to
the
army
a
carpenter
had
to
make
barrels
and
hoops
and
vine
props
a
wheelwright
had
to
make
a
cart
even
the
wives
of
the
farmers
were
kept
busy
if
they
happened
to
be
serfs
for
the
servile
women
were
obliged
to
spin
cloth
or
to
make
a
garment
for
the
big
house
every
year
all
these
things
were
exacted
and
collected
by
the
steward
whom
they
called
or
mayor
he
was
a
very
man
and
when
one
reads
the
seventy
separate
and
particular
injunctions
which
charlemagne
addressed
to
his
stewards
one
can
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
him
he
had
to
get
all
the
right
services
out
of
the
tenants
and
tell
them
what
to
do
each
week
and
see
that
they
did
it
he
had
to
be
careful
that
they
brought
the
right
number
of
eggs
and
pigs
up
to
the
house
and
did
not
foist
off
warped
or
badly
planed
planks
upon
him
he
had
to
look
after
the
household
serfs
too
and
set
them
to
work
he
had
to
see
about
storing
or
selling
or
sending
off
to
the
monastery
the
produce
of
the
estate
and
of
the
tenants
rents
and
every
year
he
had
to
present
a
full
and
detailed
account
of
his
stewardship
to
the
abbot
he
had
a
manse
of
his
own
with
services
and
rents
due
from
it
and
charlemagne
exhorted
his
stewards
to
be
prompt
in
their
payments
so
as
to
set
a
good
example
probably
his
official
duties
left
him
very
little
time
to
work
on
his
own
farm
and
he
would
have
to
put
in
a
man
to
work
it
for
him
as
charlemagne
bade
his
stewards
do
often
however
he
had
subordinate
officials
called
under
him
and
sometimes
the
work
of
receiving
and
looking
after
the
stores
in
the
big
house
was
done
by
a
special
cellarer
that
in
a
few
words
is
the
way
in
which
the
monks
of
st
germain
and
the
other
frankish
landowners
of
the
time
of
charlemagne
managed
their
estates
let
us
try
now
to
look
at
those
estates
from
a
more
human
point
of
view
and
see
what
life
was
like
to
a
farmer
who
lived
upon
them
the
abbey
possessed
a
little
estate
called
villaris
near
paris
in
the
place
now
occupied
by
the
park
of
saint
cloud
when
we
turn
up
the
pages
in
the
estate
book
dealing
with
villaris
we
find
that
there
was
a
man
called
bodo
living
there
he
had
a
wife
called
ermentrude
and
three
children
called
wido
and
gerbert
and
hildegard
and
he
owned
a
little
farm
of
arable
and
meadow
land
with
a
few
vines
and
we
know
very
nearly
as
much
about
bodo
work
as
we
know
about
that
of
a
smallholder
in
france
today
let
us
try
and
imagine
a
day
in
his
life
on
a
fine
spring
morning
towards
the
end
of
charlemagne
reign
bodo
gets
up
early
because
it
is
his
day
to
go
and
work
on
the
monks
farm
and
he
does
not
dare
to
be
late
for
fear
of
the
steward
to
be
sure
he
has
probably
given
the
steward
a
present
of
eggs
and
vegetables
the
week
before
to
keep
him
in
a
good
temper
but
the
monks
will
not
allow
their
stewards
to
take
big
bribes
as
is
sometimes
done
on
other
estates
and
bodo
knows
that
he
will
not
be
allowed
to
go
late
to
work
it
is
his
day
to
plough
so
he
takes
his
big
ox
with
him
and
little
wido
to
run
by
its
side
with
a
goad
and
he
joins
his
friends
from
some
of
the
farms
near
by
who
are
going
to
work
at
the
big
house
too
they
all
assemble
some
with
horses
and
oxen
some
with
mattocks
and
hoes
and
spades
and
axes
and
scythes
and
go
off
in
gangs
to
work
upon
the
fields
and
meadows
and
woods
of
the
seigniorial
manse
according
as
the
steward
orders
them
the
manse
next
door
to
bodo
is
held
by
a
group
of
families
frambert
and
ermoin
and
ragenold
with
their
wives
and
children
bodo
bids
them
good
morning
as
he
passes
frambert
is
going
to
make
a
fence
round
the
wood
to
prevent
the
rabbits
from
coming
out
and
eating
the
young
crops
ermoin
has
been
told
off
to
cart
a
great
load
of
firewood
up
to
the
house
and
ragenold
is
mending
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
a
barn
bodo
goes
whistling
off
in
the
cold
with
his
oxen
and
his
little
boy
and
it
is
no
use
to
follow
him
farther
because
he
ploughs
all
day
and
eats
his
meal
under
a
tree
with
the
other
ploughmen
and
it
is
very
monotonous
let
us
go
back
and
see
what
bodo
wife
ermentrude
is
doing
she
is
busy
too
it
is
the
day
on
which
the
is
due
a
fat
pullet
and
five
eggs
in
all
she
leaves
her
second
son
aged
nine
to
look
after
the
baby
hildegard
and
calls
on
one
of
her
neighbours
who
has
to
go
up
to
the
big
house
too
the
neighbour
is
a
serf
and
she
has
to
take
the
steward
a
piece
of
woollen
cloth
which
will
be
sent
away
to
st
germain
to
make
a
habit
for
a
monk
her
husband
is
working
all
day
in
the
lord
vineyards
for
on
this
estate
the
serfs
generally
tend
the
vines
while
the
freemen
do
most
of
the
ploughing
ermentrude
and
the
serf
wife
go
together
up
to
the
house
there
all
is
busy
in
the
workshop
are
several
clever
workmen
a
shoemaker
a
carpenter
a
blacksmith
and
two
silversmiths
there
are
not
more
because
the
best
artisans
on
the
estates
of
st
germain
live
by
the
walls
of
the
abbey
so
that
they
can
work
for
the
monks
on
the
spot
and
save
the
labour
of
carriage
but
there
were
always
some
craftsmen
on
every
estate
either
attached
as
serfs
to
the
big
house
or
living
on
manses
of
their
own
and
good
landowners
tried
to
have
as
many
clever
craftsmen
as
possible
charlemagne
ordered
his
stewards
each
to
have
in
his
district
workmen
namely
blacksmiths
goldsmiths
silversmiths
shoemakers
turners
carpenters
swordmakers
fishermen
foilers
soapmakers
men
who
know
how
to
make
beer
cider
perry
and
all
other
kinds
of
beverages
bakers
to
make
pasty
for
our
table
netmakers
who
know
how
to
make
nets
for
hunting
fishing
and
fowling
and
others
too
many
to
be
named
and
some
of
these
workmen
are
to
be
found
working
for
the
monks
in
the
estate
of
villaris
but
ermentrude
does
not
stop
at
the
men
workshop
she
finds
the
steward
bobs
her
curtsy
to
him
and
gives
up
her
fowl
and
eggs
and
then
she
hurries
off
to
the
women
part
of
the
house
to
gossip
with
the
serfs
there
the
franks
used
at
this
time
to
keep
the
women
of
their
household
in
a
separate
quarter
where
they
did
the
work
which
was
considered
suitable
for
women
very
much
as
the
greeks
of
antiquity
used
to
do
if
a
frankish
noble
had
lived
at
the
big
house
his
wife
would
have
looked
after
their
work
but
as
no
one
lived
in
the
stone
house
at
villaris
the
steward
had
to
oversee
the
women
their
quarter
consisted
of
a
little
group
of
houses
with
a
workroom
the
whole
surrounded
by
a
thick
hedge
with
a
strong
bolted
gate
like
a
harem
so
that
no
one
could
come
in
without
leave
their
workrooms
were
comfortable
places
warmed
by
stoves
and
there
ermentrude
who
being
a
woman
was
allowed
to
go
in
found
about
a
dozen
servile
women
spinning
and
dyeing
cloth
and
sewing
garments
every
week
the
harassed
steward
brought
them
the
raw
materials
for
their
work
and
took
away
what
they
made
charlemagne
gives
his
stewards
several
instructions
about
the
women
attached
to
his
manses
and
we
may
be
sure
that
the
monks
of
st
germain
did
the
same
on
their
model
estates
our
women
work
says
charlemagne
are
to
give
at
the
proper
time
the
materials
that
is
linen
wool
woad
vermilion
madder
wool
combs
teasels
soap
grease
vessels
and
other
objects
which
are
necessary
and
let
our
women
quarters
be
well
looked
after
furnished
with
houses
and
rooms
with
stoves
and
cellars
and
let
them
be
surrounded
by
a
good
hedge
and
let
the
doors
be
strong
so
that
the
women
can
do
our
work
properly
ermentrude
however
has
to
hurry
away
after
her
gossip
and
so
must
we
she
goes
back
to
her
own
farm
and
sets
to
work
in
the
little
vineyard
then
after
an
hour
or
two
goes
back
to
get
the
children
meal
and
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
weaving
warm
woollen
clothes
for
them
all
her
friends
are
either
working
in
the
fields
on
their
husbands
farms
or
else
looking
after
the
poultry
or
the
vegetables
or
sewing
at
home
for
the
women
have
to
work
just
as
hard
as
the
men
on
a
country
farm
in
charlemagne
time
for
instance
they
did
nearly
all
the
sheep
shearing
then
at
last
bodo
comes
back
for
his
supper
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
goes
down
they
go
to
bed
for
their
candle
gives
only
a
flicker
of
light
and
they
both
have
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
de
quincey
once
pointed
out
in
his
inimitable
manner
how
the
ancients
everywhere
went
to
bed
good
boys
from
seven
to
nine
went
to
bed
early
in
those
ages
simply
because
his
worthy
mother
earth
could
not
afford
him
candles
she
good
old
lady
would
certainly
have
shuddered
to
hear
of
any
of
her
nations
asking
for
candles
candles
indeed
she
would
have
said
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
with
so
much
excellent
daylight
running
to
waste
as
i
have
provided
what
will
the
wretches
want
next
something
of
the
same
situation
prevailed
even
in
bodo
time
this
then
is
how
bodo
and
ermentrude
usually
passed
their
working
day
but
it
may
be
complained
this
is
all
very
well
we
know
about
the
estates
on
which
these
peasants
lived
and
about
the
rents
which
they
had
to
pay
and
the
services
which
they
had
to
do
but
how
did
they
feel
and
think
and
amuse
themselves
when
they
were
not
working
rents
and
services
are
only
outside
things
an
estate
book
only
describes
routine
it
would
be
idle
to
try
to
picture
the
life
of
a
university
from
a
study
of
its
lecture
list
and
it
is
equally
idle
to
try
and
describe
the
life
of
bodo
from
the
estate
book
of
his
masters
it
is
no
good
taking
your
meals
in
the
kitchen
if
you
never
talk
to
the
servants
this
is
true
and
to
arrive
at
bodo
thoughts
and
feelings
and
holiday
amusements
we
must
bid
goodbye
to
abbot
irminon
estate
book
and
peer
into
some
very
dark
corners
indeed
for
though
by
the
aid
of
chaucer
and
langland
and
a
few
court
rolls
it
is
possible
to
know
a
great
deal
about
the
feelings
of
a
peasant
six
centuries
later
material
is
scarce
in
the
ninth
century
and
it
is
all
the
more
necessary
to
remember
the
secret
of
the
invisible
ink
bodo
certainly
plenty
of
feelings
and
very
strong
ones
when
he
got
up
in
the
frost
on
a
cold
morning
to
drive
the
plough
over
the
abbot
acres
when
his
own
were
calling
out
for
work
he
often
shivered
and
shook
the
rime
from
his
beard
and
wished
that
the
big
house
and
all
its
land
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
never
seen
and
could
not
imagine
or
else
he
wished
he
were
the
abbot
huntsman
hunting
in
the
forest
or
a
monk
of
st
germain
singing
sweetly
in
the
abbey
church
or
a
merchant
taking
bales
of
cloaks
and
girdles
along
the
high
road
to
paris
anything
in
fact
but
a
poor
ploughman
ploughing
other
people
land
an
writer
has
imagined
a
dialogue
with
him
ploughman
how
do
you
do
your
work
sir
i
work
very
hard
i
go
out
in
the
dawning
driving
the
oxen
to
the
field
and
i
yoke
them
to
the
plough
be
the
winter
never
so
stark
i
dare
not
stay
at
home
for
fear
of
my
lord
but
every
day
i
must
plough
a
full
acre
or
more
after
having
yoked
the
oxen
and
fastened
the
share
and
coulter
to
the
plough
you
any
mate
have
a
boy
who
drives
the
oxen
with
a
goad
who
is
now
hoarse
from
cold
and
shouting
poor
little
wido
well
it
is
very
hard
work
indeed
it
is
very
hard
work
nevertheless
hard
as
the
work
was
bodo
sang
lustily
to
cheer
himself
and
wido
for
is
it
not
related
that
once
when
a
clerk
was
singing
the
in
the
emperor
presence
charles
turned
to
one
of
the
bishops
saying
clerk
is
singing
very
well
whereat
the
rude
bishop
replied
clown
in
our
countryside
drones
as
well
as
that
to
his
oxen
at
their
ploughing
it
is
certain
too
that
bodo
agreed
with
the
names
which
the
great
charles
gave
to
the
months
of
the
year
in
his
own
frankish
tongue
for
he
called
january
february
march
april
may
june
july
august
september
october
november
and
december
and
bodo
was
a
superstitious
creature
the
franks
had
been
christian
now
for
many
years
but
christian
though
they
were
the
peasants
clung
to
old
beliefs
and
superstitions
on
the
estates
of
the
holy
monks
of
st
germain
you
would
have
found
the
country
people
saying
charms
which
were
hoary
with
age
parts
of
the
lay
sung
by
the
frankish
ploughman
over
his
bewitched
land
long
before
he
marched
southwards
into
the
roman
empire
or
parts
of
the
spell
which
the
performed
when
he
swarmed
his
bees
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
sea
christianity
has
coloured
these
charms
but
it
has
not
effaced
their
heathen
origin
and
because
the
tilling
of
the
soil
is
the
oldest
and
most
unchanging
of
human
occupations
old
beliefs
and
superstitions
cling
to
it
and
the
old
gods
stalk
up
and
down
the
brown
furrows
when
they
have
long
vanished
from
houses
and
roads
so
on
abbot
irminon
estates
the
muttered
charms
over
their
sick
cattle
and
over
their
sick
children
too
and
said
incantations
over
the
fields
to
make
them
fertile
if
you
had
followed
behind
bodo
when
he
broke
his
first
furrow
you
would
have
probably
seen
him
take
out
of
his
jerkin
a
little
cake
baked
for
him
by
ermentrude
out
of
different
kinds
of
meal
and
you
would
have
seen
him
stoop
and
lay
it
under
the
furrow
and
sing
earth
earth
earth
o
earth
our
mother
may
the
grant
thee
acres
upwards
pregnant
with
corn
and
plenteous
in
strength
hosts
of
grain
shafts
and
of
glittering
plants
of
broad
barley
the
blossoms
and
of
white
wheat
ears
waxing
of
the
whole
land
the
harvest
acre
bring
forth
fodder
for
men
blossoming
brightly
blessed
become
and
the
god
who
wrought
with
earth
grant
us
gift
of
growing
that
each
of
all
the
corns
may
come
unto
our
need
then
he
would
drive
his
plough
through
the
acre
the
church
wisely
did
not
interfere
with
these
old
rites
it
taught
bodo
to
pray
to
the
instead
of
to
father
heaven
and
to
the
virgin
mary
instead
of
to
mother
earth
and
with
these
changes
let
the
old
spell
he
had
learned
from
his
ancestors
serve
him
still
it
taught
him
for
instance
to
call
on
christ
and
mary
in
his
charm
for
bees
when
ermentrude
heard
her
bees
swarming
she
stood
outside
her
cottage
and
said
this
little
charm
over
them
christ
there
is
a
swarm
of
bees
outside
fly
hither
my
little
cattle
in
blest
peace
in
god
protection
come
home
safe
and
sound
sit
down
sit
down
bee
st
mary
commanded
thee
thou
shalt
not
have
leave
thou
shalt
not
fly
to
the
wood
thou
shalt
not
escape
me
nor
go
away
from
me
sit
very
still
wait
god
will
and
if
bodo
on
his
way
home
saw
one
of
his
bees
caught
in
a
brier
bush
he
immediately
stood
still
and
wished
as
some
people
wish
today
when
they
go
under
a
ladder
it
was
the
church
too
which
taught
bodo
to
add
be
it
lord
to
the
end
of
his
charm
against
pain
now
his
ancestors
for
generations
behind
him
had
believed
that
if
you
had
a
stitch
in
your
side
or
a
bad
pain
anywhere
it
came
from
a
worm
in
the
marrow
of
your
bones
which
was
eating
you
up
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
that
worm
was
to
put
a
knife
or
an
or
some
other
piece
of
metal
to
the
sore
place
and
then
wheedle
the
worm
out
on
to
the
blade
by
saying
a
charm
and
this
was
the
charm
which
bodo
heathen
ancestors
had
always
said
and
which
bodo
went
on
saying
when
little
wido
had
a
pain
out
worm
with
nine
little
worms
out
from
the
marrow
into
the
bone
from
the
bone
into
the
flesh
from
the
flesh
into
the
skin
from
the
skin
into
this
arrow
and
then
in
obedience
to
the
church
he
added
be
it
lord
but
sometimes
it
was
not
possible
to
read
a
christian
meaning
into
bodo
doings
sometimes
he
paid
visits
to
some
man
who
was
thought
to
have
a
wizard
powers
or
superstitiously
reverenced
some
twisted
tree
about
which
there
hung
old
stories
never
quite
forgotten
then
the
church
was
stern
when
he
went
to
confession
the
priest
would
ask
him
you
consulted
magicians
and
enchanters
have
you
made
vows
to
trees
and
fountains
have
you
drunk
any
magic
philtre
and
he
would
have
to
confess
what
he
did
last
time
his
cow
was
sick
but
the
church
was
kind
as
well
as
stern
serfs
come
to
you
we
find
one
bishop
telling
his
priests
must
not
give
them
as
many
fasts
to
perform
as
rich
men
put
upon
them
only
half
the
penance
the
church
knew
well
enough
that
bodo
could
not
drive
his
plough
all
day
upon
an
empty
stomach
the
hunting
drinking
feasting
frankish
nobles
could
afford
to
lose
a
meal
it
was
from
this
stern
and
yet
kind
church
that
bodo
got
his
holidays
for
the
church
made
the
pious
emperor
decree
that
on
sundays
and
days
no
servile
or
other
works
should
be
done
charlemagne
son
repeated
his
decree
in
it
runs
thus
we
ordain
according
to
the
law
of
god
and
to
the
command
of
our
father
of
blessed
memory
in
his
edicts
that
no
servile
works
shall
be
done
on
sundays
neither
shall
men
perform
their
rustic
labours
tending
vines
ploughing
fields
reaping
corn
and
mowing
hay
setting
up
hedges
or
fencing
woods
cutting
trees
or
working
in
quarries
or
building
houses
nor
shall
they
work
in
the
garden
nor
come
to
the
law
courts
nor
follow
the
chase
but
three
it
is
lawful
to
do
on
sunday
to
wit
carrying
for
the
army
carrying
food
or
carrying
if
need
be
the
body
of
a
lord
to
its
grave
item
women
shall
not
do
their
textile
works
nor
cut
out
clothes
nor
stitch
them
together
with
the
needle
nor
card
wool
nor
beat
hemp
nor
wash
clothes
in
public
nor
shear
sheep
so
that
there
may
be
rest
on
the
lord
day
but
let
them
come
together
from
all
sides
to
mass
in
the
church
and
praise
god
for
all
the
good
things
he
did
for
us
on
that
day
unfortunately
however
bodo
and
ermentrude
and
their
friends
were
not
content
to
go
quietly
to
church
on
saints
days
and
quietly
home
again
they
used
to
spend
their
holidays
in
dancing
and
singing
and
buffoonery
as
country
folk
have
always
done
until
our
own
gloomier
more
age
they
were
very
merry
and
not
at
all
refined
and
the
place
they
always
chose
for
their
dances
was
the
churchyard
and
unluckily
the
songs
they
sang
as
they
danced
in
a
ring
were
old
pagan
songs
of
their
forefathers
left
over
from
old
mayday
festivities
which
they
could
not
forget
or
ribald
which
the
church
disliked
over
and
over
again
we
find
the
church
councils
complaining
that
the
peasants
and
sometimes
the
priests
too
were
singing
songs
with
a
chorus
of
dancing
women
or
holding
and
dancings
and
evil
and
wanton
songs
and
lures
of
the
devil
over
and
over
again
the
bishops
forbade
these
songs
and
dances
but
in
vain
in
every
country
in
europe
right
through
the
middle
ages
to
the
time
of
the
reformation
and
after
it
country
folk
continued
to
sing
and
dance
in
the
churchyard
two
hundred
years
after
charlemagne
death
there
grew
up
the
legend
of
the
dancers
of
kölbigk
who
danced
on
christmas
eve
in
the
churchyard
in
spite
of
the
warning
of
the
priest
and
all
got
rooted
to
the
spot
for
a
year
till
the
archbishop
of
cologne
released
them
some
men
say
that
they
were
not
rooted
standing
to
the
spot
but
that
they
had
to
go
on
dancing
for
the
whole
year
and
that
before
they
were
released
they
had
danced
themselves
into
the
ground
people
used
to
repeat
the
little
latin
verse
which
they
were
singing
equitabat
bovo
per
silvam
frondosam
ducebat
sibi
merswindem
formosam
quid
stamus
cur
non
imus
through
the
leafy
forest
bovo
went
and
his
pretty
merswind
trotted
on
beside
him
why
are
we
standing
still
why
ca
we
go
away
another
later
story
still
is
told
about
a
priest
in
worcestershire
who
was
kept
awake
all
night
by
the
people
dancing
in
his
churchyard
and
singing
a
song
with
the
refrain
have
pity
so
that
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
and
the
next
morning
at
mass
instead
of
saying
vobiscum
he
said
have
pity
and
there
was
a
dreadful
scandal
which
got
into
a
chronicle
sometimes
our
bodo
did
not
dance
himself
but
listened
to
the
songs
of
wandering
minstrels
the
priests
did
not
at
all
approve
of
these
minstrels
who
they
said
would
certainly
go
to
hell
for
singing
profane
secular
songs
all
about
the
great
deeds
of
heathen
heroes
of
the
frankish
race
instead
of
christian
hymns
but
bodo
loved
them
and
so
did
bodo
betters
the
church
councils
had
sometimes
even
to
rebuke
abbots
and
abbesses
for
listening
to
their
songs
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
great
emperor
himself
the
good
charlemagne
loved
them
too
he
would
always
listen
to
a
minstrel
and
his
biographer
einhard
tells
us
that
wrote
out
the
barbarous
and
ancient
songs
in
which
the
acts
of
the
kings
and
their
wars
were
sung
and
committed
them
to
memory
and
one
at
least
of
those
old
sagas
which
he
liked
men
to
write
down
has
been
preserved
on
the
cover
of
a
latin
manuscript
where
a
monk
scribbled
it
in
his
spare
time
his
son
louis
the
pious
was
very
different
he
rejected
the
national
poems
which
he
had
learnt
in
his
youth
and
would
not
have
them
read
or
recited
or
taught
he
would
not
allow
minstrels
to
have
justice
in
the
law
courts
and
he
forbade
idle
dances
and
songs
and
tales
in
public
places
on
sundays
but
then
he
also
dragged
down
his
father
kingdom
into
disgrace
and
ruin
the
minstrels
repaid
charlemagne
for
his
kindness
to
them
they
gave
him
everlasting
fame
for
all
through
the
middle
ages
the
legend
of
charlemagne
grew
and
he
shares
with
our
king
arthur
the
honour
of
being
the
hero
of
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
middle
ages
every
different
century
clad
him
anew
in
its
own
dress
and
sang
new
lays
about
him
what
the
monkish
chroniclers
in
their
cells
could
never
do
for
charlemagne
these
despised
and
accursed
minstrels
did
for
him
they
gave
him
what
is
perhaps
more
desirable
and
more
lasting
than
a
place
in
gave
him
a
place
in
legend
it
is
not
every
emperor
who
rules
in
those
realms
of
gold
of
which
keats
spoke
as
well
as
in
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
in
the
realms
of
gold
charlemagne
reigns
with
king
arthur
and
his
peers
joust
with
the
knights
of
the
round
table
bodo
at
any
rate
benefited
by
charles
love
of
minstrels
and
it
is
probable
that
he
heard
in
the
lifetime
of
the
emperor
himself
the
first
beginnings
of
those
legends
which
afterwards
clung
to
the
name
of
charlemagne
one
can
imagine
him
in
the
churchyard
listening
to
fabulous
stories
of
charles
iron
march
to
pavia
such
as
a
gossiping
old
monk
of
st
gall
afterwards
wrote
down
in
his
chronicle
it
is
likely
enough
that
such
legends
were
the
nearest
bodo
ever
came
to
seeing
the
emperor
of
whom
even
the
poor
serfs
who
never
followed
him
to
court
or
camp
were
proud
but
charles
was
a
great
traveller
like
all
the
monarchs
of
the
early
middle
ages
he
spent
the
time
when
he
was
not
warring
in
trekking
round
his
kingdom
staying
at
one
of
his
estates
until
he
and
his
household
had
literally
eaten
their
way
through
it
and
then
passing
on
to
another
and
sometimes
he
varied
the
procedure
by
paying
a
visit
to
the
estates
of
his
bishops
or
nobles
who
entertained
him
royally
it
may
be
that
one
day
he
came
on
a
visit
to
bodo
masters
and
stopped
at
the
big
house
on
his
way
to
paris
and
then
bodo
saw
him
plain
for
charlemagne
would
come
riding
along
the
road
in
his
jerkin
of
otter
skin
and
his
plain
blue
cloak
einhard
tells
us
that
he
hated
grand
clothes
and
on
ordinary
days
dressed
like
the
common
people
and
after
him
would
come
his
three
sons
and
his
bodyguard
and
then
his
five
daughters
einhard
has
also
told
us
that
he
had
such
care
of
the
upbringing
of
his
sons
and
daughters
that
he
never
dined
without
them
when
he
was
at
home
and
never
travelled
without
them
his
sons
rode
along
with
him
and
his
daughters
followed
in
the
rear
some
of
his
guards
chosen
for
this
very
purpose
watched
the
end
of
the
line
of
march
where
his
daughters
travelled
they
were
very
beautiful
and
much
beloved
by
their
father
and
therefore
it
is
strange
that
he
would
give
them
in
marriage
to
no
one
either
among
his
own
people
or
of
a
foreign
state
but
up
to
his
death
he
kept
them
all
at
home
saying
he
could
not
forgo
their
society
then
with
luck
bodo
quaking
at
the
knees
might
even
behold
a
portent
new
to
his
experience
the
emperor
elephant
haroun
el
raschid
the
great
sultan
of
the
nights
had
sent
it
to
charles
and
it
accompanied
him
on
all
his
progresses
its
name
was
which
is
an
arabic
word
and
means
father
of
intelligence
a
and
it
died
a
hero
death
on
an
expedition
against
the
danes
in
it
is
certain
that
ever
afterwards
ermentrude
quelled
little
gerbert
when
he
was
naughty
with
the
threat
will
come
with
his
long
nose
and
carry
you
off
but
wido
being
aged
eight
and
a
professed
to
have
felt
no
fear
on
being
confronted
with
the
elephant
but
admitted
when
pressed
that
he
greatly
preferred
haroun
el
other
present
to
the
emperor
the
friendly
dog
who
answered
to
the
name
of
footnote
a
it
is
remarkable
that
the
name
should
have
suffered
no
corruption
in
the
chronicles
it
would
be
a
busy
time
for
bodo
when
all
these
great
folk
came
for
everything
would
have
to
be
cleaned
before
their
arrival
the
pastry
cooks
and
summoned
and
a
great
feast
prepared
and
though
the
household
serfs
did
most
of
the
work
it
is
probable
that
he
had
to
help
the
gossipy
old
monk
of
st
gall
has
given
us
some
amusing
pictures
of
the
excitement
when
charles
suddenly
paid
a
visit
to
his
subjects
there
was
a
certain
bishopric
which
lay
full
in
path
when
he
journeyed
and
which
indeed
he
could
hardly
avoid
and
the
bishop
of
this
place
always
anxious
to
give
satisfaction
put
everything
that
he
had
at
disposal
but
once
the
emperor
came
quite
unexpectedly
and
the
bishop
in
great
anxiety
had
to
fly
hither
and
thither
like
a
swallow
and
had
not
only
the
palaces
and
houses
but
also
the
courts
and
squares
swept
and
cleaned
and
then
tired
and
irritated
came
to
meet
him
the
most
pious
charles
noticed
this
and
after
examining
all
the
various
details
he
said
to
the
bishop
kind
host
you
always
have
everything
splendidly
cleaned
for
my
arrival
then
the
bishop
as
if
divinely
inspired
bowed
his
head
and
grasped
the
right
hand
and
hiding
his
irritation
kissed
it
and
said
is
but
right
my
lord
that
wherever
you
come
all
things
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
then
charles
of
all
kings
the
wisest
understanding
the
state
of
affairs
said
to
him
i
empty
i
can
also
fill
and
he
added
may
have
that
estate
which
lies
close
to
your
bishopric
and
all
your
successors
may
have
it
until
the
end
of
time
in
the
same
journey
too
he
came
to
a
bishop
who
lived
in
a
place
through
which
he
must
needs
pass
now
on
that
day
being
the
sixth
day
of
the
week
he
was
not
willing
to
eat
the
flesh
of
beast
or
bird
and
the
bishop
being
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
the
place
unable
to
procure
fish
upon
the
sudden
ordered
some
excellent
cheese
rich
and
creamy
to
be
placed
before
him
and
the
most
charles
with
the
readiness
which
he
showed
everywhere
and
on
all
occasions
spared
the
blushes
of
the
bishop
and
required
no
better
fare
but
taking
up
his
knife
cut
off
the
skin
which
he
thought
unsavoury
and
fell
to
on
the
white
of
the
cheese
thereupon
the
bishop
who
was
standing
near
like
a
servant
drew
closer
and
said
do
you
do
that
lord
emperor
you
are
throwing
away
the
very
best
part
then
charles
who
deceived
no
one
and
did
not
believe
that
anyone
would
deceive
him
on
the
persuasion
of
the
bishop
put
a
piece
of
the
skin
in
his
mouth
and
slowly
ate
it
and
swallowed
it
like
butter
then
approving
of
the
advice
of
the
bishop
he
said
true
my
good
host
and
he
added
sure
to
send
me
every
year
to
aix
two
cartloads
of
just
such
cheeses
and
the
bishop
was
alarmed
at
the
impossibility
of
the
task
and
fearful
of
losing
both
his
rank
and
his
office
he
rejoined
lord
i
can
procure
the
cheeses
but
i
can
not
tell
which
are
of
this
quality
and
which
of
another
much
i
fear
lest
i
fall
under
your
censure
then
charles
from
whose
penetration
and
skill
nothing
could
escape
however
new
or
strange
it
might
be
spoke
thus
to
the
bishop
who
from
childhood
had
known
such
cheeses
and
yet
could
not
test
them
them
in
two
he
said
fasten
together
with
a
skewer
those
that
you
find
to
be
of
the
right
quality
and
keep
them
in
your
cellar
for
a
time
and
then
send
them
to
me
the
rest
you
may
keep
for
yourself
and
your
and
your
family
this
was
done
for
two
years
and
the
king
ordered
the
present
of
cheeses
to
be
taken
in
without
remark
then
in
the
third
year
the
bishop
brought
in
person
his
laboriously
collected
cheeses
but
the
most
just
charles
pitied
his
labour
and
anxiety
and
added
to
the
bishopric
an
excellent
estate
whence
he
and
his
successors
might
provide
themselves
with
corn
and
wine
we
may
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
flustered
bishop
collecting
his
two
cartloads
of
cheeses
but
it
is
possible
that
our
real
sympathy
ought
to
go
to
bodo
who
probably
had
to
pay
an
extra
rent
in
cheeses
to
satisfy
the
emperor
taste
and
got
no
excellent
estate
to
recompense
him
a
visit
from
the
emperor
however
would
be
a
rare
event
in
his
life
to
be
talked
about
for
years
and
told
to
his
grandchildren
but
there
was
one
other
event
which
happened
annually
and
which
was
certainly
looked
for
with
excitement
by
bodo
and
his
friends
for
once
a
year
the
itinerant
justices
the
came
round
to
hold
their
court
and
to
see
if
the
local
counts
had
been
doing
justice
two
of
them
would
come
a
bishop
and
a
count
and
they
would
perhaps
stay
a
night
at
the
big
house
as
guests
of
the
abbot
and
the
next
day
they
would
go
on
to
paris
and
there
they
would
sit
and
do
justice
in
the
open
square
before
the
church
and
from
all
the
district
round
great
men
and
small
nobles
and
freemen
and
would
bring
their
grievances
and
demand
redress
bodo
would
go
too
if
anyone
had
injured
or
robbed
him
and
would
make
his
complaint
to
the
judges
but
if
he
were
canny
he
would
not
go
to
them
trusting
to
justice
alone
charlemagne
was
very
strict
but
unless
the
were
exceptionally
honest
and
pious
they
would
not
be
averse
to
taking
bribes
theodulf
bishop
of
orleans
who
was
one
of
the
emperor
has
left
us
a
most
entertaining
latin
poem
in
which
he
describes
the
attempts
of
the
clergy
and
laymen
who
flocked
to
his
court
to
buy
justice
every
one
according
to
his
means
brought
a
present
the
rich
offered
money
precious
stones
fine
materials
and
eastern
carpets
arms
horses
antique
vases
of
gold
or
silver
chiselled
with
representations
of
the
labours
of
hercules
the
poor
brought
skins
of
cordova
leather
tanned
and
untanned
excellent
pieces
of
cloth
and
linen
poor
ermentrude
must
have
worked
hard
for
the
month
before
the
justices
came
boxes
and
wax
this
cries
the
shocked
bishop
theodulf
hope
to
break
down
the
wall
of
my
soul
but
they
would
not
have
thought
that
they
could
shake
if
they
had
not
so
shaken
other
judges
before
and
indeed
if
his
picture
be
true
the
royal
justices
must
have
been
followed
about
by
a
regular
caravan
of
carts
and
horses
to
carry
their
presents
even
theodulf
has
to
admit
that
in
order
not
to
hurt
feelings
he
was
obliged
to
accept
certain
unconsidered
trifles
in
the
shape
of
eggs
and
bread
and
wine
and
chickens
and
little
birds
bodies
he
says
smacking
his
lips
small
but
very
good
to
eat
one
seems
to
detect
the
anxious
face
of
bodo
behind
those
eggs
and
little
birds
another
treat
bodo
had
which
happened
once
a
year
for
regularly
on
the
ninth
of
october
there
began
the
great
fair
of
st
denys
which
went
on
for
a
whole
month
outside
the
gates
of
paris
then
for
a
week
before
the
fair
little
booths
and
sheds
sprang
up
with
open
fronts
in
which
the
merchants
could
display
their
wares
and
the
abbey
of
st
denys
which
had
the
right
to
take
a
toll
of
all
the
merchants
who
came
there
to
sell
saw
to
it
that
the
fair
was
well
enclosed
with
fences
and
that
all
came
in
by
the
gates
and
paid
their
money
for
wily
merchants
were
sometimes
known
to
burrow
under
fences
or
climb
over
them
so
as
to
avoid
the
toll
then
the
streets
of
paris
were
crowded
with
merchants
bringing
their
goods
packed
in
carts
and
upon
horses
and
oxen
and
on
the
opening
day
all
regular
trade
in
paris
stopped
for
a
month
and
every
parisian
shopkeeper
was
in
a
booth
somewhere
in
the
fair
exchanging
the
corn
and
wine
and
honey
of
the
district
for
rarer
goods
from
foreign
parts
bodo
abbey
probably
had
a
stall
in
the
fair
and
sold
some
of
those
pieces
of
cloth
woven
by
the
serfs
in
the
quarter
or
cheeses
and
salted
meat
prepared
on
the
estates
or
wine
paid
in
rent
by
bodo
and
his
bodo
would
certainly
take
a
holiday
and
go
to
the
fair
in
fact
the
steward
would
probably
have
great
difficulty
in
keeping
his
men
at
work
during
the
month
charlemagne
had
to
give
a
special
order
to
his
stewards
that
they
should
careful
that
our
men
do
properly
the
work
which
it
is
lawful
to
exact
from
them
and
that
they
do
not
waste
their
time
in
running
about
to
markets
and
fairs
bodo
and
ermentrude
and
the
three
children
all
attired
in
their
best
did
not
consider
it
waste
of
time
to
go
to
the
fair
even
twice
or
three
times
they
pretended
that
they
wanted
to
buy
salt
to
salt
down
their
winter
meat
or
some
vermilion
dye
to
colour
a
frock
for
the
baby
what
they
really
wanted
was
to
wander
along
the
little
rows
of
booths
and
look
at
all
the
strange
things
assembled
there
for
merchants
came
to
st
denys
to
sell
their
rich
goods
from
the
distant
east
to
bodo
betters
and
wealthy
frankish
nobles
bargained
there
for
purple
and
silken
robes
with
orange
borders
stamped
leather
jerkins
peacock
feathers
and
the
scarlet
plumage
of
flamingos
which
they
called
skins
scents
and
pearls
and
spices
almonds
and
raisins
and
monkeys
for
their
wives
to
play
with
sometimes
these
merchants
were
venetians
but
more
often
they
were
syrians
or
crafty
jews
and
bodo
and
his
fellows
laughed
loudly
over
the
story
of
how
a
jewish
merchant
had
tricked
a
certain
bishop
who
craved
for
all
the
latest
novelties
by
stuffing
a
mouse
with
spices
and
offering
it
for
sale
to
him
saying
that
had
brought
this
most
precious
animal
from
judea
and
refusing
to
take
less
than
a
whole
measure
of
silver
for
it
in
exchange
for
their
luxuries
these
merchants
took
away
with
them
frisian
cloth
which
was
greatly
esteemed
and
corn
and
hunting
dogs
and
sometimes
a
piece
of
fine
work
made
in
a
monastic
workshop
and
bodo
would
hear
a
hundred
dialects
and
tongues
for
men
of
saxony
and
frisia
spain
and
provence
rouen
and
lombardy
and
perhaps
an
englishman
or
two
jostled
each
other
in
the
little
streets
and
from
time
to
time
there
came
also
an
irish
scholar
with
a
manuscript
to
sell
and
the
strange
sweet
songs
of
ireland
on
his
lips
a
hedge
of
trees
surrounds
me
a
blackbird
lay
sings
to
me
above
my
lined
booklet
the
thrilling
birds
chant
to
me
in
a
grey
mantle
from
the
top
of
bushes
the
cuckoo
sings
verily
may
the
lord
shield
me
well
do
i
write
under
the
greenwood
then
there
were
always
jugglers
and
tumblers
and
men
with
performing
bears
and
minstrels
to
wheedle
bodo
few
pence
out
of
his
pocket
and
it
would
be
a
very
tired
and
happy
family
that
trundled
home
in
the
cart
to
bed
for
it
is
not
after
all
so
dull
in
the
kitchen
and
when
we
have
quite
finished
with
the
emperor
and
all
his
peerage
it
is
really
worth
while
to
spend
a
few
moments
with
bodo
in
his
little

largely
made
up
of
bodos

is
the
greatest
city
in
the
whole
world
so
great
indeed
that
i
should
scarcely
venture
to
tell
of
it
but
that
i
have
met
at
venice
people
in
plenty
who
have
been
there
and
if
anyone
should
desire
to
tell
of
all
the
vastness
and
great
marvels
of
this
city
a
good
quire
of
paper
would
not
hold
the
matter
i
trow
for
is
the
greatest
and
noblest
city
and
the
finest

merchandise

the

let
us
go
back
in
mind
as
would
that
we
could
go
back
in
body
to
the
year
it
is
a
year
which
makes
no
great
stir
in
the
history
books
but
it
will
serve
us
well
in
those
days
as
in
our
own
venice
lay
upon
her
lagoons
a
city
as
cassiodurus
long
ago
saw
her
b
like
a
nest
afloat
on
the
shallow
waves
a
city
like
a
ship
moored
to
the
land
but
only
at
home
upon
the
seas
the
proudest
city
in
all
the
western
world
for
only
consider
her
position
lying
at
the
head
of
the
adriatic
between
east
and
west
on
the
one
great
sea
thoroughfare
of
medieval
commerce
a
mediterranean
seaport
yet
set
so
far
north
that
she
was
almost
in
the
heart
of
europe
venice
gathered
into
her
harbour
all
the
trade
routes
overland
and
overseas
on
which
could
travel
or
ships
sail
merchants
bringing
silk
and
spices
camphor
and
ivory
pearls
and
scents
and
carpets
from
the
levant
and
from
the
hot
lands
beyond
it
all
came
to
port
in
venice
for
whether
they
came
by
way
of
egypt
sailing
between
the
low
banks
of
the
nile
and
jolting
on
camels
to
alexandria
or
whether
they
came
through
the
rich
and
pleasant
land
of
persia
and
the
syrian
desert
to
antioch
and
tyre
or
whether
they
slowly
pushed
their
way
in
a
long
thin
caravan
across
the
highlands
of
central
asia
and
south
of
the
caspian
sea
to
trebizond
and
so
sailed
through
the
black
sea
and
the
dardanelles
venice
was
their
natural
focus
only
constantinople
might
have
rivalled
her
and
constantinople
she
conquered
to
venice
therefore
as
if
drawn
by
a
magnet
came
the
spoils
of
the
east
and
from
venice
they
went
by
horse
across
the
alps
by
the
brenner
and
st
gothard
passes
to
germany
and
france
or
in
galleys
by
way
of
the
straits
of
gibraltar
to
england
and
flanders
and
the
galleys
and
came
back
again
to
venice
laden
with
the
metals
of
germany
the
furs
of
scandinavia
the
fine
wools
of
england
the
cloth
of
flanders
and
the
wine
of
france

but
if
geography
gave
venice
an
unrivalled
site
the
venetians
did
the
rest
through
all
the
early
years
of
their
history
they
defied
constantinople
to
the
east
of
them
and
pope
and
holy
roman
emperor
to
the
west
sometimes
turning
to
one
sometimes
to
the
other
but
stubbornly
bent
all
the
while
upon
independence
replying
when
invited
to
become
subjects
who
is
our
help
and
protector
has
saved
us
to
dwell
upon
these
waters
this
venice
which
we
have
raised
in
the
lagoons
is
our
mighty
habitation
no
power
of
emperor
or
of
prince
can
touch
us
apt
if
threatened
to
retire
to
their
islands
and
derisively
to
fire
cannon
balls
of
bread
into
the
mainland
force
which
sought
to
starve
them
out
always
they
were
conscious
that
their
future
lay
upon
the
waters
and
in
that
east
whose
colour
had
crept
into
their
civilization
and
warmed
their
blood
they
were
eastern
and
western
both
the
venetians
hot
hearts
for
loving
and
conquering
icy
heads
for
scheming
and
ruling
bit
by
bit
they
secured
the
ring
of
mainland
behind
them
all
the
while
keeping
at
bay
the
saracen
and
slav
sea
rovers
whose
ships
were
the
terror
of
the
mediterranean
then
they
descended
upon
the
pirates
of
dalmatia
who
thus
harassed
their
trading
vessels
and
took
all
the
dalmatian
coast
the
doge
of
venice
became
duke
of
dalmatia
it
is
says
their
chronicles
the
adriatic
sea
is
in
the
duchy
of
venice
and
they
called
it
the
of
venice
now
it
was
that
there
was
first
instituted
the
magnificent
symbolical
ceremony
of
wedding
the
sea
with
the
proud
words
te
mare
in
signum
veri
perpetuique
domini
she
was
a
maiden
city
bright
and
free
no
guile
seduced
no
force
could
violate
and
when
she
took
unto
herself
a
mate
she
must
espouse
the
everlasting
sea
and
truly
it
seemed
as
though
the
very
sea
had
sworn
to
honour
and
obey
her
then
came
the
crusades
when
europe
forgot
its
differences
and
threw
itself
upon
the
paynim
who
held
the
holy
places
of
its
faith
when
men
from
all
lands
marched
behind
the
banner
of
the
cross
and
the
towers
of
jerusalem
were
more
real
than
the
tower
of
babel
now
at
last
venice
saw
her
dream
within
her
hand
it
was
venice
who
provided
galleys
and
venice
who
provided
convoys
and
commissariat
and
soldiers
at
a
good
round
sum
and
when
time
came
for
the
division
of
the
spoil
venice
demanded
in
every
captured
town
of
palestine
and
syria
a
church
a
and
the
right
to
trade
without
tolls
her
great
chance
came
in
the
fourth
crusade
when
her
old
blind
doge
enrico
dandolo
whose
blindness
had
the
nelson
touch
upon
the
pretext
that
the
crusaders
could
not
pay
the
transport
fees
agreed
upon
turned
the
whole
crusade
to
the
use
of
venice
and
conquered
first
zara
which
had
dared
to
revolt
from
her
and
then
her
ancient
her
only
rival
the
immortal
byzantium
itself
it
is
true
that
the
pope
excommunicated
the
venetians
when
they
first
turned
the
armies
against
zara
but
what
matter
they
looted
constantinople
and
brought
back
the
four
great
gilded
horses
to
st
mark
st
mark
which
has
been
compared
to
a
robbers
cave
crowded
with
the
booty
of
the
levant
and
which
held
the
sacred
body
of
the
saint
stolen
from
alexandria
by
the
venetians
nearly
four
centuries
before
concealed
in
a
tub
of
pickled
pork
in
order
to
elude
the
moslems
a
venetian
patriarch
now
said
mass
in
st
sophia
venice
received
the
proud
title
of
of
a
half
and
a
quarter
of
the
roman
empire

totius

the
words
have
a
ring
of
trumpets
and
the

buskined
in
scarlet
like
the
ancient
roman
emperors
now
ruled
supreme
over
four

the
adriatic

aegean

mysterious

into

crete
and

cyprus
were
hers
her
galleys
swept
the
pirates
from
the
seas
and
brooked
no
rivals
all
trade
with
the
east
must
pass
through
venice
and
venice
only
the
other
trading
cities
of
italy
struggled
against
her
and
genoa
came
near
to
rivalling
her
but
in
and
again
in
she
utterly
defeated
the
genoese
fleet
not
for
the
city
of
without

mountains
without
woods
men
without
faith
and
women
without
shame
was
it
to

the
horses
on

in
venice
seemed
supreme
byzantium
was
her
washpot
and
over
the

she

were
the
fruitful
gardens
the
proud
castles
of
our
people
where
they
found
again
pleasure
profit
and
security
the
venetians
went
about
the
sea
here
and
there
and
across
the
sea
and
in
all
places
wheresoever
water
runs
and
bought
merchandise
and
brought
it
to
venice
from
every
side
then
there
came
to
venice
germans
and
bavarians
french
and
lombards
tuscans
and
hungarians
and
every
people
that
lives
by
merchandise
and
they
took
it
to
their
countries
small
wonder
that
as
a
later
traveller
observed
the
venetians
were
proud
of
their
great
rule
and
when
a
son
was
born
to
a
venetian
were
wont
to
say
among
themselves
signor
is
born
into
the
world
is
it
not
true
to
say
that
venice
was
the
proudest
city
on
earth
noble

a
fair
and
splendid
thing
for
those
merchant
princes
who
held
the
gorgeous
east
in
fee
in
the
year
of
grace
in
that
year
traders
in
great
stone
lapped
by
the
waters
of
the
canals
were
checking
book
in
hand
their
sacks
of
cloves
mace
and
nutmegs
cinnamon
and
ginger
from
the
indies
ebony
chessmen
from
indo
china
ambergris
from
madagascar
and
musk
from

in
that
year
the
dealers
in
jewels
were
setting
prices
upon
diamonds
from
golconda
rubies
and
lapis
lazuli
from
badakhshan
and
pearls
from
the
fisheries
of
ceylon
and
the
silk
merchants
were
stacking
up
bales
of
silk
and
muslin
and
brocade
from
bagdad
and
yezd
and
malabar
and
china
in
that
year
young
gallants
on
the
rialto
scented
gallants
but
each
like
shakespeare
antonio
with
a
ship
venturing
into
port
somewhere
in
the
levant
rubbed
elbows
with
men
of
all
nations
heard
travellers
tales
of
all
lands
and
at
dawn
slipped
along
the
canals
in
gondolas
not
black
in
those
days
but
painted
and
hung
with
silk
saluting
the
morning
with
songs
and
the
ladies
of
venice
whom
centuries
later
titian
loved
to
paint
went
trailing
up
and
down
the
marble
steps
of
their
palaces
with
all
the
brocades
of
persia
on
their
backs
and
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
to
sweeten
their
little
hands
it
was
in
that
year
too
that
one
martino
da

a
clerk
in
the
customs
house
began
to
busy
himself
like
chaucer
after
him
less
with
his

with

he

indeed
intenseness

to
resolve
itself
into
the

here
is
nothing
indeed
of
surge

thunder
of
the
odyssey
but
the
lovely
words
sparkle
like
the
sun
on
the
waters
of
the

and
like
a

singing
itself
in

much

it

for

well

the

and
i
would
that
all
those

abound
in

and
how
the
sire
of
the
venetians
the
noble
doge
is
powerful
and
what
nobility
is
found
therein
and
the
prowess
of
the
venetian
people
and
how
they
are
all
perfect
in
the
faith
of
jesu
christ
and
obedient
to
holy
church
and
how
they
never
disobey
the
commandment
of
holy
church
within
this
noble
venice
there
dares
to
dwell
neither
heretic
nor
usurer
murderer

the

sent
in
their
time
to
lay
low
their

concerning
the
victories
that
they
won

first
and
how
they
builded
the
noble
city
called
venice

the
pleasantest
in
the

full
of
beauty
and
of
all
good

and
the
salt

runs
through

and
round
it

in
all
places
save

they
will
from

who
hearing
could
have
doubted
that
venice
defier
of

was
the
finest

most
beautiful

most
powerful
city
in
the

was

thousands
of
miles
away
from
venice
across
the
lands
and
seas
of

a
little
south
of
the
yangtze
river
and
close
to
the
sea
stood
the
city
of
kinsai
or
hangchow
the
capital
of
the
sung
emperors
who
ruled
southern
china
not
yet
in
conquered
by
the
tartars
like
venice
kinsai
stood
upon
lagoons
of
water
and
was
intersected
by
innumerable
canals
it
was
a
hundred
miles
in
circuit
not
counting
the
suburbs
which
stretched
round
it
and
there
was
not
a
span
of
ground
which
was
not
well
peopled
it
had
twelve
great
gates
and
each
of
the
twelve
quarters
which
lay
within
the
gates
was
greater
than
the
whole
of
venice
its
main
street
was
two
hundred
feet
wide
and
ran
from
end
to
end
of
the
city
broken
every
four
miles
by
a
great
square
lined
with
houses
gardens
palaces
and
the
shops
of
the
artisans
who
were
ruled
by
its
twelve
great
craft
gilds
parallel
with
the
main
street
was
the
chief
canal
beside
which
stood
the
stone
warehouses
of
the
merchants
who
traded
with
india
twelve
thousand
stone
bridges
spanned
its
waterways
and
those
over
the
principal
canals
were
high
enough
to
allow
ships
with
their
tapering
masts
to
pass
below
while
the
carts
and
horses
passed
overhead
in
its
men
chaffered
for
game
and
peaches
and
wine
made
of
rice
and
spices
and
in
the
lower
part
of
the
surrounding
houses
were
shops
where
spices
and
drugs
and
silk
pearls
and
every
sort
of
manufactured
article
were
sold
up
and
down
the
streets
of
kinsai
moved
lords
and
merchants
clad
in
silk
and
the
most
beautiful
ladies
in
the
world
swayed
languidly
past
in
embroidered
litters
with
jade
pins
in
their
black
hair
and
jewelled
earrings
swinging
against
their
smooth
cheeks
on
one
side
of
this
city
lay
a
beautiful
lake
famous
in
chinese
history
and
still
one
of
the
fairest
prospects
upon
earth
studded
with
wooded
islands
on
which
stood
pavilions
with
charming
names
prospect
chambers
house
of
the
eight
genii
and
delight
here
like
the
venetians
the
men
of
kinsai
came
for
pleasure
parties
in
barges
nobly
hung
and
furnished
the
cabins
painted
with
flowers
and
mountain
landscapes
and
looking
out
they
saw
on
one
side
the
whole
expanse
of
the
city
its
palaces
temples
convents
and
gardens
and
on
the
other
the
stretch
of
clear
water
crowded
with
coloured
pleasure
boats
over
which
came
echoing
the
high
clear
voices
and
the
tinkling
instruments
of
the
revellers
there
is
no
space
in
which
to
tell
of
the
king
palace
with
its
gardens
and
orchards
its
painted
pavilions
and
the
groves
where
the
palace
ladies
coursed
the
game
with
dogs
and
tired
of
the
pastime
flung
off
their
robes
and
ran
to
the
lake
where
they
disported
themselves
like
a
shoal
of
silver
fishes
but
a
word
must
be
said
of
the
junks
which
came
sailing
into
the
harbour
four
and
twenty
miles
away
and
up
the
river
to
the
city
and
of
the
great
concourse
of
ships
which
came
to
zaiton
perhaps
the
modern
amoy
the
port
of
the
province
here
every
year
came
a
hundred
times
more
pepper
than
came
to
the
whole
of
christendom
through
the
levantine
ports
here
from
indo
china
and
the
indies
came
spices
and
aloes
and
sandalwood
nutmegs
spikenard
and
ebony
and
riches
beyond
mention
big
junks
laded
these
things
together
with
musk
from
tibet
and
bales
of
silk
from
all
the
cities
of

and
sailed
away

and
out
of

east
india
archipelago

its
breezes
billowing
their
sails
to
ceylon
there
merchants
from
malabar
and
the
great
trading
cities
of
southern
india
took
aboard
their
cargoes
and
sold
them
in
turn
to
arab
merchants
who
in
their
turn
sold
them
to
the
venetians
in
one
or
other
of
the
levantine
ports
europeans
who
saw
zaiton
and
the
other
chinese
seaports
in
after
years
were
wont
to
say
that
no
one
not
even
a
venetian
could
picture
to
himself
the
multitude
of
trading
vessels
which
sailed
upon
those
eastern
seas
and
crowded
into
those
chinese
harbours
they
said
also
with
one
accord
that
kinsai
was
without
doubt
the
finest
and
richest
and
noblest
city
in
the
world
to
the
men
of
kinsai
venice
would
have
been
a
little
suburb
and
the
levant
a
backyard
the
whole
of
the
east
was
their
trading
field
and
their
wealth
and
civilization
were
already
old
when
venice
was
a
handful
of
mud
huts
peopled
by
fishermen

in

with

seeing
the

of

doubted
whether

kinsai
seems

away
in

from

in

and
venice
was
all
unwitting
of
its
existence
far
beyond
the
sunrise
yet
there
was
in
the
city
of
the
lagoons
that
year
watching
the
same
procession
of
the
gilds
which
canale
watched
a
boy
who
was
destined
to
link
them
for
ever
in
the
minds
of
men
a
lean
lad
of
fourteen
marco
polo
by
name
who
was
always
kicking
his
heels
on
the
quay
and
bothering
foreign
sailors
for
tales
of
distant
lands
he
heard
all
they
had
to
tell
him
very
willingly
storing
it
up
in
that
active
brain
of
his
for
his
curiosity
was
insatiable
but
always
the
tales
that
he
heard
most
willingly
were
about
the
tartars
at
this
time
the
tartars
were
at
the
height
of
their
power
in
the
west
and
the
east
tartars
ruled
at
peking
all
over
northern
china
corea
mongolia
manchuria
and
tibet
and
took
tribute
from
and
java
tartars
were
spread
over
central
asia
holding
sway
in
turkestan
and
afghanistan
the
golden
horde
ruled
the
caucasus
a
large
part
of
russia
and
a
piece
of
siberia
tartars
held
sway
in
persia
georgia
armenia
and
a
part
of
asia
minor
when
the
great
mangu
khan
died
in
one
empire
lay
spread
across
asia
and
europe
from
the
yellow
river
to
the
danube
there
had
been
nothing
like
it
in
the
world
before
and
there
was
nothing
like
it
again
until
the
russian
empire
of
modern
times
by
it
was
beginning
to
split
up
into
the
four
kingdoms
of
china
central
asia
russia
and
persia
but
still
it
was
one
people
now
the
attitude
of
the
west
to
the
tartars
at
this
time
was
very
interesting
at
first
it
feared
them
as
a
new
scourge
of
god
like
attila
and
his
huns
they
overran
poland
ravaged
hungary
and
seemed
about
to
break
like
a
great
flood
upon
the
west
and
overwhelm
it
utterly
then
the
tide
rolled
back
gradually
the
west
lost
its
first
stupefaction
and
terror
and
began
to
look
hopefully
towards
the
tartars
as
a
possible
ally
against
its
foe
the
moslem
the
christians
of
the
west
knew
that
the
tartars
had
laid
the
moslem
power
low
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
asia
and
they
knew
too
that
the
tartars
had
no
very
sharply
defined
faith
and
were
curious
of
all
beliefs
that
came
their
way
gradually
the
west
became
convinced
that
the
tartars
might
be
converted
to
christianity
and
fight
side
by
side
beneath
the
cross
against
the
hated
crescent
there
grew
up
the
strange
legend
of
prester
john
a
christian
ruling
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
asia
and
indeed
little
groups
of
nestorian
christians
did
still
survive
in
eastern
asia
at
this
time
embassies
began
to
pass
between
tartar
khans
and
western
monarchs
and
there
began
also
a
great
series
of
missions
of
franciscan
friars
to
tartary
men
who
were
ethnologists
and
geographers
at
heart
as
well
as
missionaries
and
have
left
us
priceless
accounts
of
the
lands
which
they
visited
in
the
year
of
grace
much
was
known
about
central
asia
for
in
the
pope
had
sent
the
italian
friar
john
of
plano
carpini
thither
and
in
another
friar
william
of
rubruck
a
french
fleming
had
been
sent
by
the
saintly
louis
king
of
france
both
got
as
far
as
karakorum
the
tartar
camp
on
the
borders
of
northern
china
though
they
did
not
enter
china
itself
they
had
brought
back
innumerable
stories
about
the
nomad
conquerors
who
carried
their
tents
on
carts
and
drank
fermented
mares
milk
about
the
greatness
of
the
khan
and
his
welcome
to
the
strangers
from
the
west
and
the
interest
with
which
he
listened
to
their
preaching
these
tales
were
common
property
now
and
marco
polo
must
have
listened
to
them
marco
polo
was
always
talking
of
the
tartars
always
asking
about
them
indeed
he
had
reason
to
be
interested
in
them
this
as
we
have
said
was
the
year
of
grace
and
eight
years
before
some
indeed
say
fifteen
years
his
father
nicolo
polo
and
his
uncle
maffeo
had
vanished
into
tartary
they
were
rich
merchants
trading
with
their
own
ship
to
constantinople
and
there
they
had
decided
to
go
on
a
commercial
venture
into
the
lands
of
the
golden
horde
which
lay
to
the
north
of
the
black
sea
so
they
had
sailed
over
to
the
crimea
where
they
had
a
at
soldaia
and
taking
with
them
a
store
of
costly
jewels
for
they
were
jewel
merchants
they
had
set
off
on
horseback
to
visit
the
khan
of
the
west
tartars
so
much
the
venetians
knew
for
word
had
come
back
from
soldaia
of
their
venture
but
they
had
never
returned
and
so
marco
kicking
his
heels
upon
the
quay
caught
by
the
sleeve
and
asked
them
about
those
wild
horsemen
with
their
mares
milk
and
their
magicians
and
their
droves
of
cattle
and
as
he
asked
he
wondered
about
his
father
and
his
uncle
and
whether
they
were
dead
and
lost
for
ever
in
the
wilds
of
tartary
but
even
while
he
asked
and
wondered
and
kicked
his
heels
on
the
quay
while
the
doge
tiepolo
was
watching
the
procession
of
the
gilds
and
the
clerk
canale
was
adding
up
customs
dues
or
writing
the
ancient
history
of
the
venetians
at
that
very
moment
the
two
polos
were
slowly
and
wearily
making
their
way
across
the
heights
of
central
asia
with
a
caravan
of
mules
and
camels
drawing
near
to
golden
samarcand
with
its
teeming
bazaars
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
west
and
in
the
following
year
they
reached
acre
and
took
ship
there
for
venice
and
so
at
last
came
home
they
had
a
strange
story
to
tell
stranger
and
better
than
anything
the
lean
inquisitive
boy
had
heard
upon
the
quays
they
had
soon
disposed
of
their
jewels
and
they
had
spent
a
year
at
the
camp
of
the
khan
of
the
golden
horde
of
kipchak
on
the
mighty
river
volga
then
war
broke
out
between
that
ruler
and
the
khan
who
ruled
the
persian
khanate
and
it
cut
off
their
way
back
but
marco
curiosity
was
inherited
and
no
venetian
was
ever
averse
to
seeing
strange
lands
and
seeking
out
new
opportunities
for
trade
so
the
polos
decided
to
go
on
and
visit
the
khan
of
central
asia
or
chagatai
and
perhaps
make
their
way
back
to
constantinople
by
some
unfrequented
route
they
struggled
over
plains
peopled
only
by
tartars
and
their
herds
until
at
last
they
reached
the
noble
city
of
bokhara
they
must
have
followed
the
line
of
the
oxus
river
and
if
we
reverse
the
marvellous
description
which
matthew
arnold
wrote
of
that
river
course
in
and
we
shall
have
a
picture
of
the
polos
journey
but
the
majestic
river
floated
on
out
of
the
mist
and
hum
of
that
low
land
into
the
frosty
starlight
and
there
moved
rejoicing
through
the
hush
chorasmian
waste
under
the
solitary
moon
he
right
for
the
polar
star
past
orgunjè
brimming
and
bright
and
large
then
sands
begin
to
hem
his
watery
march
and
dam
his
streams
and
split
his
currents
that
for
many
a
league
the
shorn
and
parcell
oxus
strains
along
through
beds
of
sand
and
matted
rushy
isles
oxus
forgetting
the
bright
speed
he
had
in
his
high
mountain
cradle
in
pamere
a
foil
circuitous
wanderer
till
at
last
the
dash
of
waves
is
heard
and
wide
his
luminous
home
of
waters
opens
bright
and
tranquil
from
whose
floor
the
stars
emerge
and
shine
upon
the
aral
sea
for
three
years
the
polos
remained
at
bokhara
until
one
day
it
happened
that
an
embassy
came
to
the
city
on
its
way
back
from
the
khan
in
persia
to
the
great
khan
kublai
who
ruled
in
china
and
to
whom
all
the
tartar
rulers
owed
allegiance
the
chief
ambassador
was
struck
with
the
talents
and
charm
of
the
brothers
who
had
now
become
proficient
in
the
tartar
language
and
persuaded
them
to
accompany
him
on
his
journey
to
the
presence
of
the
great
khan
who
had
never
yet
set
eyes
on
a
man
of
the
west
and
would
he
assured
them
receive
them
honourably
they
would
not
have
been
venetians
had
they
refused
such
an
opportunity
and
taking
their
venetian
servants
with
them
they
journeyed
for
a
year
with
the
tartar
embassy
across
the
heart
of
asia
and
so
reached
the
great
kublai
khan
many
years
later
marco
himself
described
their
reception
as
they
had
told
it
to
him
being
introduced
to
the
presence
of
the
grand
khan
kublai
the
travellers
were
received
by
him
with
the
condescension
and
affability
that
belonged
to
his
character
and
as
they
were
the
first
latins
who
had
made
their
appearance
in
that
country
they
were
entertained
with
feasts
and
honoured
with
other
marks
of
distinction
entering
graciously
into
conversations
with
them
he
made
earnest
inquiries
on
the
subject
of
the
western
parts
of
the
world
of
the
emperor
of
the
romans
and
of
other
christian
kings
and
princes
and
above
all
he
questioned
them
particularly
respecting
the
pope
the
affairs
of
the
church
and
the
religious
worship
and
doctrine
of
the
christians
being
well
instructed
and
discreet
men
they
gave
appropriate
answers
upon
all
these
points
and
as
they
were
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
tartar
language
they
expressed
themselves
always
in
becoming
terms
insomuch
that
the
grand
khan
holding
them
in
high
estimation
frequently
commanded
their
attendance

by

the
great
khan
finally
decided
to
send
these
two
intelligent
strangers
back
to
their
own
land
on
a
mission
from
himself
to
the
pope
asking
for
a
hundred
men
of
learning
to
be
sent
to
teach
and
preach
to
his
tartars
and
for
some
holy
oil
from
the
lamp
which
burned
over
christ
sepulchre
in
jerusalem
he
provided
them
with
a
golden
tablet
of
honour
which
acted
as
a
passport
and
secured
that
they
should
be
entertained
and
their
journey
facilitated
from
city
to
city
in
all
his
dominions
and
so
they
set
forth
once
more
upon
their
homeward
journey
but
they
were
delayed
by
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
travel
extreme
cold
the
snow
the
ice
and
the
flooding
of
the
rivers
and
it
was
three
years
before
they
at
last
reached
acre
in
the
april
of
and
finding
that
the
pope
had
died
the
year
before
and
that
no
election
had
yet
been
made
so
that
they
could
not
immediately
accomplish
their
mission
they
decided
to
visit
their
home
again
and
so
went
back
to
venice
there
nicolo
found
that
his
wife
who
had
been
with
child
at
his
departure
was
dead
leaving
behind
her
a
son

at
home
this
was
the
marvellous
tale
which
the
same
marco
drank
in
from
the
lips
of
his
father
and
uncle
but
more
marvels
were
to
come
for
two
years
the
venetians
remained
at
home
awaiting
the
election
of
a
pope
in
order
to
deliver
the
great
khan
letters
but
no
election
was
made
and
at
last
fearing
that
kublai
might
suspect
them
of
playing
him
false
they
decided
to
return
to
the
east
and
this
time
they
took
with
them
marco
now
a
lad
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
with
a
bright
eye
that
looked
everywhere
and
took
in
everything
observant
and
sober
beyond
his
age
but
when
they
got
as
far
as
ayas
on
the
gulf
of
scanderoon
news
was
brought
them
of
the
election
of
tebaldo
di
piacenza
as
pope
gregory
x
and
as
tebaldo
had
already
interested
himself
in
their
mission
they
returned
with
all
speed
to
acre
and
obtained
from
him
letters
to
the
khan
they
had
already
visited
jerusalem
and
provided
themselves
with
some
of
the
holy
oil
and
two
dominican
friars
of
letters
and
science
as
well
as
profound
theologians
though
not
the
hundred
men
of
learning
for
whom
the
khan
had
asked
and
so
they
set
out
again
from
acre
in
november
the
dominicans
may
have
been
profound
theologians
but
they
were
somewhat
adventurers
and
when
rumours
reached
them
of
wars
in
the
district
of
armenia
through
which
they
had
to
pass
they
hastily
handed
over
their
letters
to
the
venetians
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
knights
templars
and
scuttled
back
to
the
coast
and
safety
as
fast
as
they
could
go
leaving
the
polos
by
perils
and
difficulties
to
which
they
had
long
been
inured
to
proceed
alone
assuredly
st
francis
crows
over
st
dominic
somewhere
in
the
courts
of
heaven
his
friars
never
feared
for
their
skins
as
they
travelled
blithely
into
the
heat
of
india
and
the
cold
of
central
asia
and
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
comments
of
fat
william
of
rubruck
upon
the
flight
of
the
profound
theologians
the
account
of
this
second
journey
of
the
polos
may
be
read
in
the
wonderful
book
which
marco
afterwards
wrote
to
describe
the
wonders
of
the
world
they
went
from
lajazzo
through
turcomania
past
mount
ararat
where
marco
heard
tell
that
noah
ark
rested
and
where
he
first
heard
also
of
the
oil
wells
of
baku
and
the
great
inland
sea
of
caspian
past
mosul
and
bagdad
they
went
through
persia
where
brocades
are
woven
and
merchants
bring
caravan
after
caravan
of
treasures
to
hormuz
on
the
persian
gulf
into
which
port
put
the
ships
from
india
laden
with
spices
drugs
scented
woods
and
jewels
gold
tissues
and
teeth
here
they
meant
to
take
ship
but
they
desisted
perhaps
because
they
feared
to
trust
themselves
to
the
flimsy
nailless
vessels
in
which
the
arabs
braved
the
dangers
of
the
indian
ocean
so
they
turned
north
again
and
prepared
to
make
the
journey
by
land
they
traversed
the
salt
desert
of
kerman
through
balk
and
khorassan
to
badakhshan
where
there
are
horses
bred
from
alexander
the
great
steed
bucephalus
and
ruby
mines
and
lapis
lazuli
it
is
a
land
of
beautiful
mountains
and
wide
plains
of
trout
streams
and
good
hunting
and
here
the
brothers
sojourned
for
nearly
a
year
for
young
marco
had
fallen
ill
in
the
hot
plains
a
breath
of
mountain
air
blows
through
the
page
in
which
he
describes
how
amid
the
clean
winds
his
health
came
back
to
him
when
he
was
well
they
went
on
again
and
ascended
the
upper
oxus
to
the
highlands
of
pamir
roof
of
the
world
as
it
has
been
called
in
our
own
time
a
land
of
icy
cold
where
marco
saw
and
described
the
great
horned
sheep
which
hunters
and
naturalists
still
call
after
him
the
a
land
which
no
traveller
save
benedict
goës
about
described
again
until
lieutenant
john
wood
of
the
indian
navy
went
there
in
thence
they
descended
upon
kashgar
yarkand
and
khotan
where
jade
is
found
regions
which
no
one
visited
again
until
from
khotan
they
pushed
on
to
the
vicinity
of
lake
lob
never
to
be
reached
again
until
a
russian
explorer
got
there
in
they
halted
there
to
load
asses
and
camels
with
provisions
and
then
with
sinking
hearts
they
began
the
terrible
thirty
days
journey
across
the
gobi
desert
marco
gives
a
vivid
description
of
its
terrors
voices
which
seem
to
call
the
traveller
by
name
the
march
of
phantom
cavalcades
which
lures
them
off
the
road
at
night
spirits
which
fill
the
air
with
sounds
of
music
drums
and
gongs
and
the
clash
of
arms
all
those
illusions
which
human
beings
have
heard
and
seen
and
feared
in
every
desert
and
in
every
age
what
might
this
be
a
thousand
fantasies
begin
to
throng
into
my
memory
of
calling
shapes
and
beckoning
shadows
dire
and
airy
tongues
that
syllable
men
names
on
sands
and
shores
and
desert
wildernesses
at
last
they
arrived
safely
at
tangut
in
the
extreme
of
china
and
skirting
the
frontier
across
the
great
steppes
of
mongolia
they
were
greeted
by
the
khan
people
who
had
been
sent
forward
to
meet
them
at
the
distance
of
forty
days
journey
and
so
at
last
they
reached
his
presence
in
the
may
of
having
journeyed
for
three
years
and
a
half
the
great
khan
received
the
polos
kindly
listened
attentively
to
the
account
which
they
gave
of
their
mission
commended
them
for
their
zeal
and
fidelity
and
received
the
holy
oil
and
the
pope
gifts
with
reverence
he
then
observed
the
boy
marco
now
a
gallant
and
personable
enough
no
doubt
and
inquired
who
he
was
and
nicolo
made
answer
this
is
your
servant
and
my
son
to
which
the
khan
replied
is
welcome
and
much
it
pleases
me
and
enrolled
marco
among
his
own
attendants
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
and
close
association
for
kublai
khan
soon
found
that
marco
polo
was
both
discreet
and
intelligent
and
began
to
employ
him
on
various
missions
moreover
marco
for
his
part
found
that
the
great
khan
was
always
desirous
of
learning
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
many
tribes
over
whom
he
ruled
kublai
had
to
the
full
that
noble
curiosity
which
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
and
it
irked
him
exceedingly
that
his
envoys
good
conscientious
men
followed
their
noses
upon
his
business
looking
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
and
as
like
as
not
never
even
noticed
that
among
the
aboriginal
hill
tribes
of
the
interior
called
miaotzu
there
prevailed
the
peculiar
and
entertaining
custom
of
the
wherein
chinese
go
to
bed
and
lie
in
in
their
ladies
stead
prince
in
consequence
says
marco
them
for
no
better
than
fools
and
dolts
and
would
say
i
had
far
liever
hearken
about
the
strange
things
and
the
manners
of
the
different
countries
you
have
seen
than
merely
be
told
of
the
business
you
went
upon
very
different
was
the
habit
of
the
venetian
who
as
a
lad
had
lent
ear
so
readily
to
swarthy
sailors
on
the
rialto
he
quickly
picked
up
several
of
the
languages
current
in
the
great
khan
empire
and
here
is
his
account
of
his
proceedings
when
on
a
mission
to
foreign
parts
perceiving
that
the
great
khan
took
a
pleasure
in
hearing
accounts
of
whatever
was
new
to
him
respecting
the
customs
and
manners
of
people
and
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
distant
countries
he
endeavoured
wherever
he
went
to
obtain
correct
information
on
these
subjects
and
made
notes
of
all
he
saw
and
heard
in
order
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
his
master
in
short
during
seventeen
years
that
he
continued
in
his
service
he
rendered
himself
so
useful
that
he
was
employed
on
confidential
missions
to
every
part
of
the
empire
and
its
dependencies
and
sometimes
also
he
travelled
on
his
own
private
account
but
always
with
the
consent
and
sanctioned
by
the
authority
of
the
grand
khan
in
such
circumstances
it
was
that
marco
polo
had
the
opportunity
of
acquiring
a
knowledge
either
by
his
own
observation
or
by
what
he
collected
from
others
of
so
many
things
until
his
time
unknown
respecting
the
eastern
parts
of
the
world
and
these
he
diligently
and
regularly
committed
to
writing
and
by
this
means
he
obtained
so
much
honour
that
he
provoked
the
jealousy
of
other
officers
of
the
court
it
is
small
wonder
that
when
first
the
lad
came
back
with
his
reports
the
great
khan
and
his
courtiers
marvelled
and
exclaimed
this
young
man
live
he
will
assuredly
be
a
person
of
great
worth
and
ability
it
was
while
on
these
various
public
missions
that
marco
polo
journeyed
through
the
provinces
of
shansi
shensi
and
szechuen
and
skirted
the
edge
of
tibet
to
yunnan
and
entered
northern
burma
lands
unknown
again
to
the
west
until
after
for
three
years
he
was
himself
governor
of
the
great
city
of
yangchow
which
had
towns
under
its
jurisdiction
and
was
full
of
traders
and
makers
of
arms
and
military
accoutrements
he
visited
karakorum
in
mongolia
the
old
tartar
capital
and
with
his
uncle
maffeo
spent
three
years
in
tangut
on
another
occasion
he
went
on
a
mission
to
cochin
china
and
by
sea
to
the
southern
states
of
india
and
he
has
left
a
vivid
picture
of
the
great
trading
cities
of
malabar
he
might
indeed
have
pondered
with
ulysses
i
am
become
a
name
for
always
roaming
with
a
hungry
heart
much
have
i
seen
and
known
cities
of
men
and
manners
climates
countries
governments
myself
not
least
but
honoured
of
them
all
he
describes
the
great
capital
cambaluc
peking
in
the
north
and
the
beautiful
kinsai
hangchow
in
the
south
he
describes
the
khan
summer
palace
at
shandu
with
its
woods
and
gardens
its
marble
palace
its
bamboo
pavilion
swung
like
a
tent
from
two
hundred
silken
cords
its
stud
of
white
mares
and
its
magicians
indeed
his
description
of
the
summer
palace
is
better
known
to
englishmen
than
any
other
part
of
his
work
for
shandu
is
xanadu
which
coleridge
saw
in
a
dream
after
he
had
been
reading
marco
book
and
wove
into
wonderful
verse
in
xanadu
did
kubla
khan
a
stately
pleasure
dome
decree
where
alph
the
sacred
river
ran
past
caverns
measureless
to
man
down
to
a
sunless
sea
and
there
were
gardens
bright
with
sinuous
rills
where
blossomed
many
an
incense
bearing
tree
and
here
were
forests
ancient
as
the
hills
enfolding
sunny
spots
of
greenery
nor
is
it
only
palaces
which
marco
polo
describes
for
he
tells
of
the
great
canal
and
inland
river
trade
of
china
the
exports
and
imports
at
its
harbours
the
paper
money
the
system
of
posts
and
caravanserais
which
linked
it
together
he
gives
an
unsurpassed
picture
of
that
huge
rich
peaceful
empire
full
of
wealth
and
commerce
and
learned
men
and
beautiful
things
and
of
its
ruler
kublai
khan
one
of
the
noblest
monarchs
who
ever
sat
upon
a
throne
who
since
is
a
sea
that
salts
all
the
rivers
that
flow
into
it
was
far
more
than
a
barbarous
mongol
khan
was
in
very
truth
a
chinese
emperor
whose
house
called
by
the
chinese
the
dynasty
takes
its
place
among
the
great
dynasties
of
china
even
more
than
marco
polo
tells
us
he
must
indeed
have
seen
the
impersonality
of
the
greater
part
of
the
book
is
its
one
blemish
for
we
would
fain
know
more
of
how
he
lived
in
china
there
is
some
evidence
that
he
consorted
with
the
mongol
conquerors
rather
than
with
the
chinese
and
that
chinese
was
not
one
of
the
languages
which
he
learned
he
makes
no
mention
of
several
characteristic
chinese
customs
such
as
the
compressed
feet
of
the
women
and
fishing
with
cormorants
both
of
which
are
described
by
ordoric
of
pordenone
after
him
he
travelled
through
the
tea
districts
of
but
he
never
mentions
and
he
has
no
word
to
say
even
of
the
great
wall
and
how
typical
a
european
he
is
in
some
ways
for
all
his
keen
interest
in
new
and
strange
things
are
he
says
of
the
peaceful
merchants
and
scholars
of
suchow
pusillanimous
race
and
solely
occupied
with
their
trade
and
manufactures
in
these
indeed
they
display
considerable
ability
and
if
they
were
as
enterprising
manly
and
warlike
as
they
are
ingenious
so
prodigious
is
their
number
that
they
might
not
only
subdue
the
whole
of
the
province
but
carry
their
rule
further
still
nearly
five
hundred
years
later
we
find
the
same
judgement
expressed
in
different
words
fifty
years
of
europe
than
a
cycle
of
cathay
the
answer
is
a
question
would
you
rather
be
the
pusillanimous
chinese
who
painted
the
landscape
roll
of
which
a
portion
is
reproduced
opposite
page
or
the
enterprising
manly
and
warlike
european
of
the
same
period
whose
highest
achievement
in
pictorial
art
is
the
picture
of
marco
polo
embarkation
reproduced
opposite
page
what
is
civilization
and
what
progress
yet
marco
polo
shows
himself
throughout
his
book
far
from
unable
to
appreciate
other
standards
than
those
of
his
own
land
and
religion
for
of
buddha
he
says
that
he
been
a
christian
he
would
have
been
a
great
saint
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
he
could
honour
kublai
as
that
great
khan
deserved
nevertheless
although
marco
polo
shows
less
knowledge
of
the
chinese
than
one
might
expect
from
the
extraordinary
detail
and
fidelity
of
his
observation
in
other
directions
he
must
have
known
many
of
these
charming
and
cultivated
people
at
kinsai
or
cambaluc
or
at
the
city
which
he
governed
among
others
he
must
have
known
the
great
artist
who
painted
the
roll
mentioned
above
chao
whom
the
chinese
called
ksüeh
tao
or
the
of
pine
trees
and
snow
he
was
a
lineal
descendant
of
the
founder
of
the
sung
dynasty
and
a
hereditary
official
when
that
dynasty
at
last
fell
before
the
tartars
he
and
his
friend
hsüan
man
of
the
jade
pool
and
roaring
torrent
retired
into
private
life
but
in
chao
was
summoned
to
court
by
kublai
khan
and
to
the
indignation
of
his
friend
returned
and
became
secretary
in
the
board
of
war
occupying
his
time
in
this
post
what
must
marco
polo
have
thought
of
him
in
painting
his
marvellous
pictures
he
became
a
great
favourite
of
the
khan
and
was
always
about
the
court
and
marco
polo
must
have
known
him
well
and
perhaps
have
watched
him
at
work
painting
those
matchless
landscapes
and
those
pictures
of
horses
and
men
for
which
he
was
famous
marco
loved
horses
as
indeed
he
loved
all
kinds
of
sport
of
which
he
had
plenty
for
the
khan
was
a
great
hunter
and
hawker
and
he
has
left
a
word
picture
of
the
white
brood
mares
at
shansi
which
may
be
set
beside
chao
brush
picture
of
the
horses
in
the
park
of
kublai
khan
he
knew
too
perhaps
chao
wife
the
lady
kuan
who
painted
most
exquisitely
the
graceful
bamboo
and
the
peony
so
loved
by
chinese
artists
and
of
whom
it
is
related
that
would
watch
the
moving
shadows
of
the
sprays
thrown
by
the
moon
on
the
paper
windows
and
transfer
the
fugitive
outlines
to
paper
with
a
few
strokes
of
her
supple
brush
so
that
every
smallest
scrap
of
her
work
was
mounted
in
albums
as
models
for
others
to
copy
chao
and
the
lady
kuan
had
a
son
chao
yung
who
is
of
special
interest
to
us
for
he
painted
a
picture
of
a
tangut
hunter
and
marco
polo
has
also
given
a
description
of
the
tartar
horsemen
and
of
the
province
of
tangut
where
he
saw
and
described
the
musk
deer
and
the
yak
but
we
must
return
to
the
history
of
the
polos
in
china
from
time
to
time
in
marco
book
we
hear
also
of
his
father
and
uncle
travelling
about
the
empire
growing
rich
by
trade
and
amassing
a
store
of
those
jewels
in
the
value
of
which
they
were
so
skilled
even
helping
the
khan
to
reduce
a
rebel
town
by
constructing
siege
engines
for
him
on
the
european
model
handy
venetians
that
they
were
who
could
lay
their
hands
to
anything
without
doubt
they
were
proud
of
their
marco
who
from
an
inquisitive
lad
had
grown
to
so
wise
and
observant
a
man
and
had
risen
to
so
high
a
position
so
for
seventeen
years
the
three
polos
abode
in
the
khan
service
in
china
the
long
months
slipped
by
and
at
last
they
began
to
feel
upon
them
a
longing
to
see
venice
and
the
lagoons
again
and
to
hear
mass
once
more
beneath
the
majestic
roof
of
st
mark
before
they
died
moreover
kublai
khan
was
growing
old
himself
and
the
favour
which
he
had
always
shown
to
them
had
excited
some
jealousy
among
his
own
people
and
they
feared
what
might
happen
when
he
died
but
the
old
khan
was
adamant
to
all
their
prayers
wealth
and
honours
were
theirs
for
the
asking
but
he
would
not
let
them
go
they
might
indeed
have
died
in
china
and
we
of
the
west
might
never
have
heard
of
marco
polo
or
of
kublai
khan
but
for
a
mere
accident
a
stroke
of
fate
which
gave
them
their
chance
in
arghun
the
khan
of
persia
lost
by
death
his
favourite
wife
bolgana
and
according
to
her
dying
wish
he
sent
ambassadors
to
the
court
of
peking
to
ask
for
another
bride
from
her
own
mongol
tribe
their
overland
route
home
again
was
endangered
by
a
war
and
they
therefore
proposed
to
return
by
sea
just
at
that
moment
marco
polo
happened
to
return
from
a
voyage
on
which
he
had
been
sent
and
spoke
with
such
assurance
of
the
ease
with
which
it
had
been
accomplished
that
the
three
ambassadors
conceived
a
strong
desire
to
take
with
them
all
three
of
these
ingenious
venetians
who
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
ships
thus
it
was
that
the
great
khan
was
prevailed
upon
very
reluctantly
to
let
them
go
early
in
they
set
sail
from
the
busy
port
of
zaiton
in
fourteen
big
chinese
junks
of
which
marco
writing
of
the
shipping
of
the
indian
and
china
seas
has
left
an
excellent
description
with
the
three
envoys
the
princess
a
beautiful
girl
of
seventeen
bèle
dame
at
avenant
says
marco
who
had
an
eye
for
pretty
ladies
and
a
large
suite
of
attendants
one
version
of
marco
book
says
that
they
took
with
them
also
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
mansi
one
of
those
sung
princesses
who
in
happier
days
had
wandered
beside
the
lake
in
hangchow
and
who
had
no
doubt
been
brought
up
at
cambaluc
by
the
care
of
kublai
khan
favourite
queen
the
lady
jamui
the
voyage
was
a
long
and
difficult
one
they
suffered
lengthy
delays
in
sumatra
ceylon
and
southern
india
occupied
by
marco
in
studying
the
sea
charts
of
the
coast
of
india
which
the
arab
pilots
showed
him
and
adding
to
his
knowledge
of
these
parts
which
he
had
already
visited
thus
it
was
over
two
years
before
the
junks
reached
persia
and
two
of
the
three
envoys
and
a
large
number
of
their
suite
had
died
by
the
way
when
at
last
they
landed
it
was
found
that
arghun
the
prospective
bridegroom
had
meanwhile
died
too
leaving
his
throne
in
the
charge
of
a
regent
for
his
young
son
but
on
the
regent
advice
a
convenient
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
found
by
handing
the
princess
over
to
this
prince
and
marco
and
his
uncles
duly
conducted
her
to
him
in
the
province
of
timochain
where
marco
polo
noticed
that
the
women
were
my
opinion
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
where
stood
the
famed
and
solitary
and
where
men
still
told
tales
of
great
alexander
and
darius
there
they
took
leave
of
their
princess
who
had
come
on
the
long
voyage
to
love
them
like
fathers
so
marco
says
and
wept
sorely
when
they
parted
it
was
while
they
were
still
in
persia
where
they
stayed
for
nine
months
after
handing
over
the
princess
that
the
polos
received
news
of
the
death
of
the
great
khan
whom
they
had
served
so
faithfully
for
so
many
years
he
died
at
the
ripe
age
of
eighty
and
with
his
death
a
shadow
fell
over
central
asia
darkening
the
shining
yellow
roofs
of
cambaluc
the
barren
plains
of
sericana
where
chineses
drive
with
sails
and
wind
their
cany
waggons
light
the
minarets
of
persia
and
the
tents
of
wild
kipchak
tartars
galloping
over
the
russian
steppes
so
wide
had
been
the
sway
of
kublai
khan
a
shadow
fell
also
upon
the
heart
of
marco
polo
it
was
as
though
a
door
had
clanged
to
behind
him
never
to
open
again
the
course
of
their
journey
he
says
travellers
received
intelligence
of
the
great
khan
having
departed
this
life
which
entirely
put
an
end
to
all
prospects
of
their
revisiting
those
regions
so
he
and
his
elders
went
on
by
way
of
tabriz
trebizond
and
constantinople
to
venice
and
sailed
up
to
the
city
of
the
lagoons
at
long
last
at
the
end
of
a
strange
legend
has
come
down
to
us
about
the
return
of
the
polos
they
got
thither
says
ramusio
who
edited
marco
book
in
the
fifteenth
century
same
fate
befell
them
as
befell
ulysses
who
when
he
returned
after
his
twenty
years
wanderings
to
his
native
ithaca
was
recognized
by
nobody
when
clad
in
their
uncouth
tartar
garb
the
three
polos
knocked
at
the
doors
of
the
ca
polo
no
one
recognized
them
and
they
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
their
relatives
and
that
they
were
indeed
those
polos
who
had
been
believed
dead
for
so
many
years
the
story
goes
that
they
satisfactorily
established
their
identity
by
inviting
all
their
kinsmen
to
a
great
banquet
for
each
course
of
which
they
put
on
a
garment
more
magnificent
than
the
last
and
finally
bringing
in
their
coarse
tartar
coats
they
ripped
open
the
seams
and
the
lining
thereof
which
there
poured
forth
a
great
quantity
of
precious
stones
rubies
sapphires
carbuncles
diamonds
and
emeralds
which
had
been
sewn
into
each
coat
with
great
care
so
that
nobody
could
have
suspected
that
anything
was
there
the
exhibition
of
such
an
extraordinary
and
infinite
treasure
of
jewels
and
precious
stones
which
covered
the
table
once
more
filled
all
present
with
such
astonishment
that
they
were
dumb
and
almost
beside
themselves
with
surprise
and
they
at
once
recognized
these
honoured
and
venerated
gentlemen
in
the
ca
polo
whom
at
first
they
had
doubted
and
received
them
with
the
greatest
honour
and
reverence
human
nature
has
changed
little
since
the
thirteenth
century
the
precious
stones
are
a
legend
but
no
doubt
the
polos
brought
many
with
them
for
they
were
jewel
merchants
by
trade
they
had
had
ample
opportunities
for
business
in
china
and
the
great
khan
had
loaded
them
with
and
other
handsome
jewels
of
great
value
to
boot
jewels
were
the
most
convenient
form
in
which
they
could
have
brought
home
their
wealth
but
the
inquiring
marco
brought
other
things
also
to
tickle
the
curiosity
of
the
venetians
as
he
lets
fall
from
time
to
time
in
his
book
he
brought
for
example
specimens
of
the
silky
hair
of
the
tangut
yak
which
his
countrymen
much
admired
the
dried
head
and
feet
of
a
musk
deer
and
the
seeds
of
a
dye
plant
probably
indigo
from
sumatra
which
he
sowed
in
venice
but
which
never
came
up
because
the
climate
was
not
sufficiently
warm
he
brought
presents
also
for
the
doge
for
an
inventory
made
in
of
things
found
in
the
palace
of
marino
faliero
includes
among
others
a
ring
given
by
kublai
khan
a
tartar
collar
a
sword
an
indian
brocade
and
a
book
by
the
hand
of
the
aforesaid
marco
called
locis
mirabilibus
the
rest
of
marco
polo
life
is
quickly
told
the
legend
goes
that
all
the
youth
of
venice
used
to
resort
to
the
ca
polo
in
order
to
hear
his
stories
for
not
even
among
the
foreign
sailors
on
the
quays
where
once
the
boy
marco
had
wandered
and
asked
about
the
tartars
were
stories
the
like
of
his
to
be
heard
and
because
he
was
always
talking
of
the
greatness
of
kublai
khan
dominions
the
millions
of
revenue
the
millions
of
junks
the
millions
of
riders
the
millions
of
towns
and
cities
they
gave
him
a
nickname
and
jestingly
called
him
marco
or
which
is
being
interpreted
marco
and
the
name
even
crept
into
the
public
documents
of
the
republic
while
the
courtyard
of
his
house
became
known
as
the
to
return
from
legend
to
history
the
ancient
rivalry
between
venice
and
genoa
had
been
growing
during
marco
polo
absence
nor
had
venice
always
prevailed
often
as
her
galleys
sailed
dipping
deep
for
famagusta
and
the
hidden
sun
that
rings
black
cyprus
with
a
lake
of
fire
questing
brown
slaves
or
syrian
oranges
the
pirate
genoese
hell
raked
them
till
they
rolled
blood
water
fruit
and
corpses
up
the
hold
at
last
in
three
years
after
marco
return
a
genoese
fleet
under
lamba
doria
sailed
for
the
adriatic
to
bate
the
pride
of
venice
in
her
own
sea
the
venetians
fitted
out
a
great
fleet
to
meet
it
and
marco
polo
the
handy
man
who
knew
so
much
about
navigation
albeit
more
skilled
with
chinese
junks
than
with
western
ships
went
with
it
as
gentleman
commander
of
a
galley
the
result
of
the
encounter
was
a
shattering
victory
for
the
genoese
off
curzola
venetian
galleys
were
burnt
and
seven
thousand
prisoners
were
haled
off
to
genoa
among
them
marco
polo
who
had
now
a
taste
of
the
results
of
that
enterprise
manliness
and
warfare
whose
absence
he
so
deprecated
in
the
men
of
suchow
but
soon
there
began
to
run
through
the
streets
and
courtyards
of
genoa
a
rumour
that
in
prison
there
lay
a
certain
venetian
captain
with
tales
so
wonderful
to
beguile
the
passing
hours
that
none
could
tire
of
hearing
them
and
anon
the
gallants
and
sages
and
the
bold
ladies
of
genoa
were
flocking
just
as
the
men
of
the
rialto
had
flocked
before
to
hear
his
stories
of
kublai
khan
lord
of
the
fruits
of
tartary
her
rivers
lord
of
the
hills
of
tartary
glen
thicket
wood
and
dale
her
flashing
stars
her
scented
breeze
her
trembling
lakes
like
foamless
seas
her
in
every
purple
vale
marco
so
runs
ramusio
account
of
the
tradition
which
lingered
in
venice
in
his
day
himself
in
this
position
and
witnessing
the
general
eagerness
to
hear
all
about
cathay
and
the
great
khan
which
indeed
compelled
him
daily
to
repeat
his
story
till
he
was
weary
was
advised
to
put
the
matter
in
writing
so
he
found
means
to
get
a
letter
written
to
his
father
in
venice
in
which
he
desired
the
latter
to
send
those
notes
and
memoranda
which
he
had
brought
home
with
him
it
happened
that
in
prison
with
marco
polo
there
lay
a
certain
pisan
writer
of
romances
rusticiano
by
name
who
had
probably
been
taken
prisoner
before
at
the
battle
of
melaria
when
so
many
pisan
captives
had
been
carried
to
genoa
that
the
saying
arose
who
would
see
pisa
let
him
go
to
genoa
rusticiano
was
skilled
in
the
writing
of
french
the
language
of
romances
in
which
he
had
written
versions
of
the
round
table
tales
and
in
him
marco
polo
found
a
ready
scribe
who
took
down
the
stories
as
he
told
them
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
venetian
prisoners
and
genoese
gentlemen
raptly
drinking
in
all
the
wonders
of
kublai
khan
it
was
by
a
just
instinct
that
when
all
was
written
rusticiano
prefixed
to
the
tale
that
same
address
to
the
lords
and
gentlemen
of
the
world
bidding
them
to
take
heed
and
listen
which
he
had
been
wont
to
set
at
the
beginning
of
his
tales
of
tristan
and
lancelot
and
king
arthur
lords
emperors
and
kings
dukes
and
marquises
counts
knights
and
burgesses
and
all
ye
men
who
desire
to
know
the
divers
races
of
men
and
the
diversities
of
the
different
regions
of
the
world
take
ye
this
book
and
cause
it
to
be
read
and
here
shall
ye
find
the
greatest
marvels
but
he
adds
polo
a
wise
and
learned
citizen
of
venice
states
distinctly
what
things
he
saw
and
what
things
he
heard
from
others
for
this
book
will
be
a
truthful
one
marco
polo
truthful
marvels
were
more
wonderful
even
than
the
exploits
of
arthur
knights
and
were
possibly
better
suited
to
the
respectable
rusticiano
pen
for
his
only
other
claim
to
distinction
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
seems
to
be
that
in
his
abridgment
of
the
romance
of
lancelot
he
entirely
omits
the
episode
if
episode
it
can
be
called
of
the
loves
of
lancelot
and
guinevere
remarks
his
french
editor
the
copy
of
lancelot
which
fell
into
the
hands
of
poor
francesca
of
rimini
was
not
one
of
those
expurgated
by
rusticiano
marco

was
released
from

there
must
have
been
mourning
in
the
palaces
of

and
returned
to

at
the
end
of
a
year
sometimes
hereafter
his
name
occurs
in
the
records
of

as
he
moves
about

party
wall
we
know
too
from
his
will
that
he
had
a
wife
named
donata
and
three
daughters
fantina
bellela
and
moreta
had
he
loved
before
under
the
alien
skies
where
his
youth
was
spent
some
languid
exquisite
lady
of
china
or
hardy
tartar
maid
had
he
profited
himself
from
the
strange
marriage
customs
of
tibet
of
which
he
remarks
with
one
of
his
very
rare
gleams
of
humour
cele
contree
aurent
bien

les

vingt

had
fantina
bellela
and
moreta
flying
their
gerfalcons
at
the
quails
by
the
shores
of
the
lake
where
the
khan
hunted
and
telling
tales
of
the
half
legendary
father
who
sailed
away
for
ever
when
they
were
boys
in
the
days
of
kublai
khan
these
things
we
can
not
know
nor
can
we
ever
guess
whether
he
regretted
that
only
daughters
sprang
from
his
loins
in
the
city
of
the
lagoons
and
no
venetian
son
to
go
venturing
again
to
the
country
where
assuredly
he
had
left
a
good
half
of
his
heart
perhaps
he
talked
of
it
sometimes
to
peter
his
tartar
servant
whom
he
freed
at
his
death
all
bondage
as
completely
as
i
pray
god
to
release
mine
own
soul
from
all
sin
and
guilt
some
have
thought
that
he
brought
peter
the
tartar
with
him
from
the
east
and
the
thought
is
a
pleasant
one
but
it
is
more
likely
that
he
bought
him
in
italy
for
the
venetians
were
inveterate
and
captive
tartars
were
held
of
all
the
slaves
the
strongest
and
best
so
his
life
passed
and
in
marco
polo
died
honoured
much
by
his
after
making
a
will
which
is
still
preserved
in
the
library
of
st
mark
a
characteristic
story
of
his
is
related
by
a
dominican
friar
one
jacopo
of
acqui
who
wrote
some
time
later
he
told
in
the
book
says
jacopo
not
as
much
as
he
had
really
seen
because
of
the
tongues
of
detractors
who
being
ready
to
impose
their
own
lies
on
others
are
over
hasty
to
set
down
as
lies
what
they
in
their
perversity
disbelieve
or
do
not
understand
and
because
there
are
many
great
and
strange
things
in
that
book
which
are
reckoned
past
all
credence
he
was
asked
by
his
friends
on
his
to
correct
the
book
by
removing
everything
that
went
beyond
the
facts
to
which
his
reply
was
that
he
had
not
told
of
what
he
had
really
seen
how
well
one
can
see
that
last
indignant
flash
of
the
dying
observer
who
in
the
long
years
of
his
youth
had
taken
notes
of
strange
tribes
and
customs
for
the
wise
and
gracious
kublai
khan
and
whom
little
men
now
dared
to
doubt
indeed
modern
discovery
has
entirely
confirmed
the
exactitude
of
marco
polo
observation
it
is
true
that
he
sometimes
repeated
some
very
tall
stories
which
had
been
told
to
him
of
men
in
the
andaman
islands
and
of
the
and
female
islands
so
beloved
of
medieval
geographers
these
were
sailors
yarns
and
where
marco
polo
reports
what
he
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
he
reports
with
complete
accuracy
nor
does
he
ever
pretend
to
have
seen
a
place
which
he
had
not
visited
the
explorers
of
our
own
day
aurel
stein
ellsworth
huntington
and
sven
hedin
travelling
in
central
asia
have
triumphantly
vindicated
him
is
says
an
eminent
french
historian
though
the
originals
of
very
old
photographs
had
been
suddenly
rediscovered
the
old
descriptions
of
things
which
were
unchanged
could
be
perfectly
superimposed
upon
present
reality
and
huntington
and
aurel
stein
took
with
them
to
the
inaccessible
districts
of
central
asia
as
the
book
of
the
chinese
pilgrim
hiwen
thsang
seventh
century
and
the
book
of
marco
polo
and
over
and
over
again
found
how
accurate
were
their
descriptions
it
is
indeed
almost
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
extent
of
marco
accomplishment
it
is
best
estimated
in
the
words
of
sir
henry
yule
whose
edition
of
his
book
is
one
of
the
great
works
of
english
scholarship
he
was
the
first
traveller
to
trace
a
route
across
the
whole
longitude
of
asia
naming
and
describing
kingdom
after
kingdom
which
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
the
desert
of
persia
the
flowering
plateaux
and
wild
gorges
of
badakhshan
the
rivers
of

that

so
lately
threatened
to

up

had

to
reveal
china
in
all
its
wealth
and
vastness
its
mighty

its
huge
cities
its
rich

its
swarming
population
the
inconceivably
vast

quickened

us
of

all
their
eccentricities
of

of

where
no

set

again
till
the

the

of

of

perfectly
safe
for

the
persons
at

who
have
walked
in

this
is
in
the

thirteenth
and

fourteenth
centuries
in
the
despised
and
hidebound
middle

it

some
of
the

and
the
age
forsooth
of
but
a
change
came
over
everything
in
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
darkness
fell
again
and
swallowed
up
peking
and
hangchow
the
great
ports
the
crowding
junks
the
noble
civilization
no
longer
was
the
great
trade
route
and
no
longer
did
christian
friars
chant
their
masses
in
zaiton
the
tartar
dynasty
fell
and
the
new
rulers
of
china
reverted
to
the
old
policy
moreover
islam
spread
its
conquests
all
over
central
asia
and
lay
like
a
rampart
between
the
far
east
and
west
a
great
wall
of
intolerance
and
hatred
stronger
by
far
than
the
great
wall
of
stone
which
the
chinese
had
once
built
to
keep
out
the
tartars
all
marco
polo
marvels
became
no
more
than
a
legend
a
traveller
tale
but
that
great
adventurer
was
not
done
for
yet
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
after
marco
death
a
genoese
sea
captain
sat
poring
over
one
of
the
new
printed
books
which
men
were
beginning
to
buy
and
to
hand
about
among
themselves
the
book
which
he
was
reading
was
the
latin
version
of
marco
polo
travels
he
was
reading
it
with
intentness
and
indeed
with
passion
as
he
read
he
made
notes
in
the
margin
on
over
seventy
pages
he
made
his
notes
from
time
to
time
he
frowned
and
turned
back
and
read
again
the
tale
of
those
great
ports
of
cathay
and
the
palaces
of
cipangu
and
always
he
wondered
how
those
lands
might
be
reached
now
that
the
wall
of
darkness
covered
central
asia
and
anarchy
blocked
the
road
to
the
persian
gulf
one
day
may
we
not
see
him
he
lifted
his
head
and
smote
his
hand
upon
the
table
will
sail
west
he
said
i
shall
find
the
lost
island
of
antilha
in
the
western
ocean
but
maybe
on
its
far
rim
i
shall
indeed
come
to
cipangu
for
the
world
is
round
and
somewhere
in
those
great
seas
beyond
the
coast
of
europe
must
lie
marco
polo
rich
cathay
i
will
beseech
the
kings
of
england
and
of
spain
for
a
ship
and
a
company
and
the
silk
and
the
spices
and
the
wealth
shall
be
theirs
i
will
sail
west
said
the
genoese
sea
captain
and
he
smote
his
thigh
will
sail
west
west
west
and
this
was
the
last
of
messer
marvels
he
discovered
china
in
the
thirteenth
century
when
he
was
alive
and
in
the

was

to
canterbury
there
is
no
portrait
in

gallery
which
has
given
rise
to
more
diverse
comment
among
critics
one
interprets
it
as
a
cutting
attack
on
the
worldliness
of
the
church
another
thinks
that
chaucer
meant
to
draw
a
charming
and
sympathetic
picture
of
womanly
gentleness
one
says
that
it
is
a
caricature
another
an
ideal
and
an
american
professor
even
finds
in
it
a
psychological
study
of
thwarted
maternal
instinct
apparently
because
madame
eglentyne
was
fond
of
little
dogs
and
told
a
story
about
a
schoolboy
the
mere
historian
may
be
excused
from
following
these
vagaries
to
him
chaucer
prioress
like
monk
and
chaucer
friar
will
simply
be
one
more
instance
of
the
almost
photographic
accuracy
of
the
poet
observation
the
rippling
undercurrent
of
satire
is
always
there
but
it
is
chaucer
own
peculiar
satire
mellow
amused
uncondemning
the
most
subtle
kind
of
satire
which
does
not
depend
upon
exaggeration
the
literary
critic
has
only
chaucer
words
and
his
own
heart
or
sometimes
low
be
it
spoken
his
own
desire
to
be
original
by
which
to
guide
his
judgement
but
the
historian
knows
he
has
all
sorts
of
historical
sources
in
which
to
study
nunneries
and
there
he
meets
chaucer
prioress
at
every
turn
above
all
he
has
the
bishop
registers
for
a
long
time
historians
foolishly
imagined
that
kings
and
wars
and
parliaments
and
the
jury
system
alone
were
history
they
liked
chronicles
and
acts
of
parliament
and
it
did
not
strike
them
to
go
and
look
in
dusty
episcopal
archives
for
the
big
books
in
which
medieval
bishops
entered
up
the
letters
which
they
wrote
and
all
the
complicated
business
of
running
their
dioceses
but
when
historians
did
think
of
looking
there
they
found
a
mine
of
priceless
information
about
almost
every
side
of
social
and
ecclesiastical
life
they
had
to
dig
for
it
of
course
for
almost
all
that
is
worth
knowing
has
to
be
mined
like
precious
metals
out
of
a
rock
and
for
one
nugget
the
miner
often
has
to
grub
for
days
underground
in
a
mass
of
dullness
and
when
he
has
got
it
he
has
to
grub
in
his
own
heart
or
else
he
will
not
understand
it
the
historians
found
fine
gold
in
the
bishops
registers
when
once
they
persuaded
themselves
that
it
was
not
beneath
their
dignity
to
grub
there
they
found
descriptions
of
vicarages
with
all
their
furniture
and
gardens
they
found
marriage
disputes
they
found
wills
full
of
entertaining
legacies
to
people
dead
hundreds
of
years
ago
they
found
excommunications
they
found
indulgences
to
men
for
relieving
the
poor
repairing
roads
and
building
bridges
long
before
there
was
any
poor
law
or
any
county
council
they
found
trials
for
heresy
and
witchcraft
they
found
accounts
of
miracles
worked
at
the
tombs
of
saints
and
even
of
some
quite
unsaintly
people
such
as
thomas
of
lancaster
and
edward
ii
and
simon
de
montfort
they
found
lists
of
travelling
expenses
when
the
bishops
rode
round
their
dioceses
in
one
they
even
found
a
minute
account
of
the
personal
appearance
of
queen
philippa
then
a
little
girl
at
her
father
court
at
hainault
whom
the
bishop
of
exeter
had
been
sent
to
inspect
in
order
to
see
if
she
were
pretty
and
good
enough
to
marry
edward
iii
she
was
nine
years
old
and
the
bishop
said
that
her
second
teeth
were
whiter
than
her
first
teeth
and
that
her
nose
was
broad
but
not
snub
which
was
reassuring
for
edward
last
but
not
least
the
historians
found
a
multitude
of
documents
about
monasteries
and
among
these
documents
they
found
visitation
records
and
among
visitation
records
they
found
chaucer
prioress
smiling
full
simple
and
coy
fair
forehead
wimple
necklace
little
dogs
and
all
as
though
she
had
stepped
into
a
stuffy
register
by
mistake
for
the
and
was
longing
to
get
out
again
this
was
the
reason
that
madame
eglentyne
got
into
the
register
in
the
middle
ages
all
the
nunneries
of
england
and
a
great
many
of
the
monasteries
used
to
be
visited
at
intervals
by
the
bishop
of
their
diocese
or
by
somebody
sent
by
him
in
order
to
see
whether
they
were
behaving
properly
it
was
rather
like
the
periodical
visitation
of
a
school
by
one
of
her
majesty
inspectors
only
what
happened
was
very
different
when
her
majesty
inspector
comes
he
does
not
sit
in
state
in
the
hall
and
call
all
the
inmates
in
front
of
him
one
after
another
from
the
head
mistress
to
the
smallest
child
in
the
first
form
and
invite
them
to
say
in
what
way
they
think
the
school
is
not
being
properly
run
and
what
complaints
they
have
to
make
against
their
mistresses
and
which
girl
habitually
breaks
the
rules
all
breathed
softly
and
privately
into
his
ear
with
no
one
to
overhear
them
but
when
the
bishop
came
to
visit
a
nunnery
that
is
precisely
what
happened
first
of
all
he
sent
a
letter
to
say
he
was
coming
and
to
bid
the
nuns
prepare
for
him
then
he
came
with
his
clerks
and
a
learned
official
or
two
and
was
met
solemnly
by
the
prioress
and
all
the
nuns
and
preached
a
sermon
in
their
church
and
was
entertained
perhaps
to
dinner
and
then
he
prepared
to
examine
them
and
one
by
one
they
came
before
him
in
order
of
rank
beginning
with
the
prioress
and
what
they
had
to
do
was
to
tell
tales
about
each
other
he
wanted
to
find
out
if
the
prioress
were
ruling
well
and
if
the
services
were
properly
performed
and
if
the
finances
were
in
good
order
and
if
discipline
were
maintained
and
if
any
nun
had
a
complaint
then
was
the
time
to
make
it
and
the
nuns
were
full
of
complaints
a
modern
schoolgirl
would
go
pale
with
horror
over
their
capacity
for
if
one
nun
had
boxed
her
sister
ears
if
another
had
cut
church
if
another
were
too
much
given
to
entertaining
friends
if
another
went
out
without
a
licence
if
another
had
run
away
with
a
wandering
fluteplayer
the
bishop
was
sure
to
hear
about
it
that
is
unless
the
whole
convent
were
in
a
disorderly
state
and
the
nuns
had
made
a
compact
to
wink
at
each
peccadilloes
and
not
to
betray
them
to
the
bishop
which
occasionally
happened
and
if
the
prioress
were
at
all
unpopular
he
was
quite
certain
to
hear
all
about
her
fares
splendidly
in
her
own
room
and
never
invites
us
says
one
nun
has
favourites
says
another
when
she
makes
corrections
she
passes
lightly
over
those
whom
she
likes
and
speedily
punishes
those
whom
she
dislikes
is
a
fearful
scold
says
a
third
dresses
more
like
a
secular
person
than
a
nun
and
wears
rings
and
necklaces
says
a
fourth
goes
out
riding
to
see
her
friends
far
too
often
says
a
fifth
spoons
and
no
wonder
when
she
never
consults
us
in
any
business
as
she
ought
to
do
they
go
on
like
that
for
pages
and
the
bishop
must
often
have
wanted
to
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
and
shout
to
them
to
stop
especially
as
the
prioress
had
probably
spent
half
an
hour
for
her
part
in
telling
him
how
disobedient
and
and
thoroughly
badly
behaved
the
nuns
were
all
these
tales
the
bishop
clerk
solemnly
wrote
down
in
a
big
book
and
when
the
examination
was
over
the
bishop
summoned
all
the
nuns
together
again
and
if
they
had
answered
is
well
as
they
sometimes
did
or
only
mentioned
trivial
faults
he
commended
them
and
went
his
way
and
if
they
had
shown
that
things
really
were
in
a
bad
way
he
investigated
particular
charges
and
scolded
the
culprits
and
ordered
them
to
amend
and
when
he
got
back
to
his
palace
or
the
manor
where
he
was
staying
he
wrote
out
a
set
of
injunctions
based
on
the
complaints
and
saying
exactly
how
things
were
to
be
improved
and
of
these
injunctions
one
copy
was
entered
in
his
register
and
another
was
sent
by
hand
to
the
nuns
who
were
supposed
to
read
it
aloud
at
intervals
and
to
obey
everything
in
it
we
have
in
many
registers
these
lists
of
injunctions
copied
into
them
by
the
clerks
and
in
some
notably
in
a
splendid
lincoln
register
belonging
to
the
good
bishop
alnwick
we
have
also
the
evidence
of
the
nuns
just
as
it
was
taken
down
from
their
chattering
mouths
and
these
are
the
most
human
and
amusing
of
all
medieval
records
it
is
easy
to
see
what
important
historical
documents
visitation
reports
are
especially
in
a
diocese
like
lincoln
which
possesses
an
almost
unbroken
series
of
registers
ranging
over
the
three
centuries
before
the
dissolution
so
that
one
can
trace
the
whole
history
of
some
of
the
nunneries
by
the
successive
visitations
let
us
see
what
light
the
registers
will
throw
upon
madame
eglentyne
before
chaucer
observed
her
mounting
her
horse
outside
the
tabard
inn
doubtless
she
first
came
to
the
nunnery
when
she
was
quite
a
little
girl
because
girls
counted
as
grown
up
when
they
were
fifteen
in
the
middle
ages
they
could
be
married
out
of
hand
at
twelve
and
they
could
become
nuns
for
ever
at
fourteen
probably
eglentyne
father
had
three
other
daughters
to
marry
each
with
a
dowry
and
a
gay
young
spark
of
a
son
who
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
fashionable
suits
embroidered
as
it
were
a
mede
all
ful
of
fresshe
flowers
white
and
rede
so
he
thought
he
had
better
settle
the
youngest
at
once
and
he
got
together
a
dowry
it
was
rarely
possible
to
get
into
a
nunnery
without
one
though
church
law
really
forbade
anything
except
voluntary
offerings
and
taking
eglentyne
by
the
hand
one
summer
day
he
popped
her
into
a
nunnery
a
few
miles
off
which
had
been
founded
by
his
ancestors
we
may
even
know
what
it
cost
him
it
was
rather
a
select
aristocratic
house
and
he
had
to
pay
an
entrance
fee
of
in
modern
money
and
then
he
had
to
give
eglentyne
her
new
habit
and
a
bed
and
some
other
furniture
and
he
had
to
make
a
feast
on
the
day
she
became
a
nun
and
invite
all
the
nuns
and
all
his
own
friends
and
he
had
to
tip
the
friar
who
preached
the
sermon
and
altogether
it
was
a
great
affair
but
the
feast
would
not
come
at
once
because
eglentyne
would
have
to
remain
a
novice
for
some
years
until
she
was
old
enough
to
take
the
vows
so
she
would
stay
in
the
convent
and
be
taught
how
to
sing
and
to
read
and
to
talk
french
of
the
school
of
with
the
other
novices
perhaps
she
was
the
youngest
for
girls
often
did
not
enter
the
convent
until
they
were
old
enough
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
wanted
to
be
nuns
but
there
were
certainly
some
other
quite
tiny
novices
learning
their
lessons
and
occasionally
there
would
be
a
little
girl
like
the
one
whose
sad
fate
is
recorded
in
a
dull
shut
up
in
a
nunnery
by
a
wicked
stepfather
who
wanted
her
inheritance
a
nun
could
not
inherit
land
because
she
was
supposed
to
be
dead
to
the
world
and
told
by
the
nuns
that
the
devil
would
fly
away
with
her
if
she
tried
to
set
foot
outside
the
door
however
eglentyne
had
a
sunny
disposition
and
liked
life
in
the
nunnery
and
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
the
pretty
table
manners
which
she
learnt
there
as
well
as
for
talking
french
and
though
she
was
not
at
all
prim
and
liked
the
gay
clothes
and
pet
dogs
which
she
used
to
see
at
home
in
her
mother
bower
still
she
had
no
hesitation
at
all
about
taking
the
veil
when
she
was
fifteen
and
indeed
she
rather
liked
the
fuss
that
was
made
of
her
and
being
called
or
which
was
the
courtesy
title
always
given
to
a
nun
the
years
passed
and
eglentyne
life
jogged
along
peacefully
enough
behind
the
convent
walls
the
great
purpose
for
which
the
nunneries
existed
and
which
most
of
them
fulfilled
not
unworthily
was
the
praise
of
god
eglentyne
spent
a
great
deal
of
her
time
singing
and
praying
in
the
convent
church
and
as
we
know
ful
wel
she
song
the
service
divyne
entuned
in
hir
nose
ful
semely
the
nuns
had
seven
monastic
offices
to
say
every
day
about
the
night
office
was
said
they
all
got
out
of
bed
when
the
bell
rang
and
went
down
in
the
cold
and
the
dark
to
the
church
choir
and
said
matins
followed
immediately
by
lauds
then
they
went
back
to
bed
just
as
the
dawn
was
breaking
in
the
sky
and
slept
again
for
three
hours
and
then
got
up
for
good
at
six
and
said
prime
after
that
there
followed
tierce
sext
none
vespers
and
compline
spread
at
intervals
through
the
day
the
last
service
compline
was
said
at
in
winter
and
at
in
summer
after
which
the
nuns
were
supposed
to
go
straight
to
bed
in
the
dorter
in
which
connexion
one
nun
rule
ordains
that
shall
push
up
against
another
wilfully
nor
spit
upon
the
stairs
going
up
and
down
but
if
they
tread
it
out
forthwith
they
had
in
all
about
eight
hours
sleep
broken
in
the
middle
by
the
night
service
they
had
three
meals
a
light
repast
of
bread
and
beer
after
prime
in
the
morning
a
solid
dinner
to
the
accompaniment
of
reading
aloud
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
a
short
supper
immediately
after
vespers
at
or
from
to
in
winter
and
from
to
in
summer
eglentyne
and
her
sisters
were
supposed
to
devote
themselves
to
manual
or
brain
work
interspersed
with
a
certain
amount
of
sober
and
godly
recreation
she
would
spin
or
embroider
vestments
with
the
crowned
monogram
m
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
blue
and
gold
thread
or
make
little
silken
purses
for
her
friends
and
finely
sewn
bands
for
them
to
bind
round
their
arms
after
a
bleeding
she
would
read
too
in
her
psalter
or
in
such
lives
as
the
convent
possessed
written
in
french
or
english
for
her
latin
was
weak
though
she
could
construe
vincit
perhaps
her
convent
took
in
a
few
little
schoolgirls
to
learn
their
letters
and
good
manners
with
the
nuns
and
when
she
grew
older
she
helped
to
teach
them
to
read
and
sing
for
though
they
were
happy
they
did
not
receive
a
very
extensive
education
from
the
good
sisters
in
the
summer
eglentyne
was
sometimes
allowed
to
work
in
the
convent
garden
or
even
to
go
out
haymaking
with
the
other
nuns
and
came
back
to
confide
in
her
confessor
that
she
had
seen
the
cellaress
returning
therefrom
seated
behind
the
chaplain
on
his
nag
and
had
thought
what
fun
it
must
be
to
jog
behind
stout
dan
john
except
for
certain
periods
of
relaxation
strict
silence
was
supposed
to
be
observed
in
the
convent
for
a
large
part
of
the
day
and
if
eglentyne
desired
to
communicate
with
her
sisters
she
was
urged
to
do
so
by
means
of
signs
the
persons
who
drew
up
the
lists
of
signs
which
were
in
use
in
medieval
monastic
houses
however
combined
a
preternatural
ingenuity
with
an
extremely
exiguous
sense
of
humour
and
the
sort
of
dumb
pandemonium
which
went
on
at
eglentyne
dinner
table
must
often
have
been
more
than
speech
the
sister
who
desired
fish
would
her
hands
displayed
sidelings
in
manner
of
a
fish
tail
she
who
wanted
milk
would
her
left
little
finger
in
manner
of
milking
for
mustard
one
would
her
nose
in
the
upper
part
of
her
right
fist
and
rub
it
another
for
salt
would
with
her
right
thumb
and
forefinger
over
the
left
thumb
another
desirous
of
wine
would
her
forefinger
up
and
down
the
end
of
her
thumb
afore
her
eye
and
the
guilty
sacristan
struck
by
the
thought
that
she
had
not
provided
incense
for
the
mass
would
her
two
fingers
into
her
nostrils
in
one
such
table
drawn
up
for
nuns
there
are
no
less
than
signs
and
on
the
whole
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
rule
of
the
same
nuns
enjoins
that
is
never
lawful
to
use
them
without
some
reason
and
profitable
need
for
more
hurt
hath
an
evil
word
and
more
offence
it
may
be
to
god
the
nuns
of
course
would
not
have
been
human
if
they
had
not
sometimes
grown
a
little
weary
of
all
these
services
and
this
silence
for
the
religious
life
was
not
nor
was
it
intended
to
be
an
easy
one
it
was
not
a
mere
means
of
escape
from
work
and
responsibility
in
the
early
golden
age
of
monasticism
only
men
and
women
with
a
vocation
that
is
to
say
a
real
genius
for
monastic
life
entered
convents
moreover
when
there
they
worked
very
hard
with
hand
and
brain
as
well
as
with
soul
and
so
they
got
variety
of
occupation
which
is
as
good
as
a
holiday
the
basis
of
wise
st
benedict
rule
was
a
nicely
adjusted
combination
of
variety
with
regularity
for
he
knew
human
nature
thus
monks
and
nuns
did
not
find
the
services
monotonous
and
indeed
regarded
them
as
by
far
the
best
part
of
the
day
but
in
the
later
middle
ages
when
chaucer
lived
young
people
had
begun
to
enter
monastic
houses
rather
as
a
profession
than
as
a
vocation
many
truly
spiritual
men
and
women
still
took
the
vows
but
with
them
came
others
who
were
little
suited
to
monastic
life
and
who
lowered
its
standard
because
it
was
hard
and
uncongenial
to
them
eglentyne
became
a
nun
because
her
father
did
not
want
the
trouble
and
expense
of
finding
her
a
husband
and
because
being
a
nun
was
about
the
only
career
for
a
lady
who
did
not
marry
moreover
by
this
time
monks
and
nuns
had
grown
more
lazy
and
did
little
work
with
their
hands
and
still
less
with
their
heads
particularly
in
nunneries
where
the
early
tradition
of
learning
had
died
out
and
where
many
nuns
could
hardly
understand
the
latin
in
which
their
services
were
written
the
result
was
that
monastic
life
began
to
lose
that
essential
variety
which
st
benedict
had
designed
for
it
and
as
a
result
the
regularity
sometimes
became
irksome
and
the
series
of
services
degenerated
into
a
mere
routine
of
peculiar
monotony
which
many
of
the
singers
could
no
longer
keep
alive
with
spiritual
fervour
thus
sometimes
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
this
happened
in
all
or
even
in
the
majority
of
houses
the
services
became
empty
forms
to
be
hurried
through
with
scant
devotion
and
occasionally
with
scandalous
irreverence
it
was
the
almost
inevitable
reaction
from
too
much
routine
carelessness
in
the
performance
of
the
monastic
hours
was
an
exceedingly
common
fault
during
the
later
middle
ages
though
the
monks
were
always
worse
about
it
than
the
nuns
sometimes
they
the
services
sometimes
they
behaved
with
the
utmost
levity
as
at
exeter
in
where
the
canons
giggled
and
joked
and
quarrelled
during
the
services
and
dropped
hot
candle
wax
from
the
upper
stalls
on
to
the
shaven
heads
of
the
singers
in
the
stalls
below
sometimes
they
came
late
to
matins
in
the
small
hours
after
midnight
this
fault
was
common
in
nunneries
for
the
nuns
always
would
insist
on
having
private
drinkings
and
gossipings
in
the
evening
after
compline
instead
of
going
straight
to
bed
as
the
rule
demanded
a
habit
which
did
not
conduce
to
wakefulness
at
consequently
they
were
somewhat
sleepy
at
matins
and
found
an
almost
johnsonian
difficulty
in
getting
up
early
wise
st
benedict
foresaw
the
difficulty
when
he
wrote
in
his
rule
they
rise
for
the
divine
office
let
them
gently
encourage
one
another
because
of
the
excuses
made
by
those
that
are
drowsy
at
the
nunnery
of
stainfield
in
the
bishop
discovered
that
half
an
hour
sometimes
elapsed
between
the
last
stroke
of
the
bell
and
the
beginning
of
the
service
and
that
some
of
the
nuns
did
not
sing
but
dozed
partly
because
they
had
not
enough
candles
but
chiefly
because
they
went
late
to
bed
and
whoever
is
without
sin
among
us
let
him
cast
the
first
stone
there
was
a
tendency
also
among
both
monks
and
nuns
to
slip
out
before
the
end
of
the
service
on
any
good
or
bad
excuse
they
had
to
see
after
the
dinner
or
the
their
gardens
needed
weeding
or
they
did
not
feel
well
but
the
most
common
fault
of
all
was
to
gabble
through
the
services
as
quickly
as
they
could
in
order
to
get
them
over
they
left
out
the
syllables
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
words
they
omitted
the
dipsalma
or
pause
between
two
verses
so
that
one
side
of
the
choir
was
beginning
the
second
half
before
the
other
side
had
finished
the
first
they
skipped
sentences
they
mumbled
and
slurred
what
should
have
been
in
their
nose
ful
semely
and
altogether
they
made
a
terrible
mess
of
the
stately
plainsong
so
prevalent
was
the
fault
of
gabbling
that
the
father
of
evil
was
obliged
to
charter
a
special
devil
called
tittivillus
whose
sole
business
it
was
to
collect
all
these
dropped
syllables
and
carry
them
back
to
his
master
in
a
big
bag
in
one
way
or
another
we
have
a
good
deal
of
information
about
him
for
he
was
always
letting
himself
be
seen
by
holy
men
who
generally
had
a
sharp
eye
for
devils
one
latin
rhyme
distinguishes
carefully
between
the
contents
of
his
sack
are
they
who
wickedly
corrupt
the
holy
psalms
the
dangler
the
gasper
the
leaper
the
galloper
the
dragger
the
mumbler
the
the
and
the
tittivillus
collecteth
the
fragments
of
these
words
indeed
a
holy
cistercian
abbot
once
interviewed
the
poor
little
devil
himself
and
heard
about
his
alarming
industry
this
is
the
story
as
it
is
told
in
myroure
of
oure
written
for
the
delectation
of
the
nuns
of
syon
in
the
fifteenth
century
read
of
a
holy
abbot
of
the
order
of
citeaux
that
while
he
stood
in
the
choir
at
matins
he
saw
a
fiend
that
had
a
long
and
great
poke
hanging
about
his
neck
and
went
about
the
choir
from
one
to
another
and
waited
busily
after
all
letters
and
syllables
and
words
and
failings
that
any
made
and
them
he
gathered
diligently
and
put
them
in
his
poke
and
when
he
came
before
the
abbot
waiting
if
aught
had
escaped
him
that
he
might
have
gotten
and
put
in
his
bag
the
abbot
was
astonied
and
afeard
of
the
foulness
and
misshape
of
him
and
said
unto
him
what
art
thou
and
he
answered
and
said
i
am
a
poor
devil
and
my
name
is
tittivillus
and
i
do
mine
office
that
is
committed
unto
me
and
what
is
thine
office
said
the
abbot
he
answered
i
must
each
day
he
said
bring
my
master
a
thousand
pokes
full
of
failings
and
of
negligences
and
syllables
and
words
that
are
done
in
your
order
in
reading
and
singing
and
else
i
must
be
sore
beaten
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
often
got
his
beating
though
one
may
be
sure
that
madame
eglentyne
busily
chanting
through
her
nose
never
gave
him
the
slightest
help
in
his
spare
moments
when
he
was
not
engaged
in
picking
up
those
unconsidered
trifles
which
the
monks
let
fall
from
the
psalms
tittivillus
used
to
fill
up
odd
corners
of
his
sack
with
the
idle
talk
of
people
who
gossiped
in
church
and
he
also
sat
up
aloft
and
collected
all
the
high
notes
of
vain
tenors
who
sang
to
their
own
glory
instead
of
to
the
glory
of
god
and
pitched
the
chants
three
notes
higher
than
the
cracked
voices
of
their
elders
could
rise
but
the
monotony
of
convent
life
sometimes
did
more
than
make
the
nuns
unconscious
contributors
to
tittivillus
sack
it
sometimes
played
havoc
with
their
tempers
the
nuns
were
not
chosen
for
convent
life
because
they
were
saints
they
were
no
more
immune
from
tantrums
than
was
the
wife
of
bath
who
was
out
of
all
charity
when
other
village
wives
went
into
church
before
her
and
sometimes
they
got
terribly
on
each
others
nerves
readers
of
will
remember
that
when
the
seven
deadly
sins
come
in
wrath
tells
how
he
was
cook
to
the
prioress
of
a
convent
and
says
he
of
wycked
wordes
i

and
eyther
hitte
other
vnder
the
cheke
hadde
thei
had
knyves
by
cryst
her
eyther
had
killed
other
to
be
sure
it
is
not
often
that
we
hear
of
anything
so
bad
as
that
prioress
who
used
to
drag
her
nuns
round
the
choir
by
their
veils
in
the
middle
of
the
service
screaming
and
at
them
or
that
other
lady
who
used
to
kick
them
and
hit
them
on
the
head
with
her
fists
and
put
them
in
the
stocks
all
prioresses
were
not
plesaunt
and
amiable
of
port
or
stately
in
their
manner
the
records
of
monastic
visitations
show
that
bad
temper
and
petty
bickering
sometimes
broke
the
peace
of
convent
life
but
we
must
be
back
at
eglentyne
she
went
on
living
for
ten
or
twelve
years
as
a
simple
nun
and
she
sang
the
services
very
nicely
and
had
a
sweet
temper
and
pretty
manners
and
was
very
popular
moreover
she
was
of
good
birth
chaucer
tells
us
a
great
deal
about
her
beautiful
behaviour
at
table
and
her
courtesy
which
shows
that
she
was
a
lady
born
and
bred
indeed
his
description
of
this
might
have
been
taken
straight
out
of
one
of
the
feudal
books
of
deportment
for
girls
even
her
personal
beauty
straight
nose
grey
eyes
and
little
red
mouth
conforms
to
the
courtly
standard
the
convents
were
apt
to
be
rather
snobbish
ladies
and
rich
burgesses
daughters
got
into
them
but
poor
and
girls
never
so
the
nuns
probably
said
to
each
other
that
what
with
her
pretty
ways
and
her
good
temper
and
her
aristocratic
connexions
would
it
be
a
good
thing
to
choose
her
for
prioress
when
the
old
prioress
died
and
so
they
did
and
she
had
been
a
prioress
for
some
years
when
chaucer
met
her
at
first
it
was
very
exciting
and
eglentyne
liked
being
called
by
nuns
who
were
older
than
herself
and
having
a
private
room
to
sit
in
and
all
the
visitors
to
entertain
but
she
soon
found
that
it
was
not
by
any
means
all
a
bed
of
roses
for
there
was
a
great
deal
of
business
to
be
done
by
the
head
of
a
house
not
only
looking
after
the
internal
discipline
of
the
convent
but
also
superintending
money
matters
and
giving
orders
to
the
bailiffs
on
her
estates
and
seeing
that
the
farms
were
paying
well
and
the
tithes
coming
in
to
the
churches
which
belonged
to
the
nunnery
and
that
the
italian
merchants
who
came
to
buy
the
wool
off
her
sheeps
backs
gave
a
good
price
for
it
in
all
this
business
she
was
supposed
to
take
the
advice
of
the
nuns
meeting
in
the
where
all
business
was
transacted
i
am
afraid
that
sometimes
eglentyne
used
to
think
that
it
was
much
better
to
do
things
by
herself
and
so
she
would
seal
documents
with
the
convent
seal
without
telling
them
one
should
always
distrust
the
head
of
an
office
or
school
or
society
who
says
with
a
air
that
it
is
much
more
satisfactory
to
do
the
thing
herself
than
to
depute
it
to
the
proper
subordinates
it
either
means
that
she
is
an
autocrat
or
else
that
she
can
not
organize
madame
eglentyne
was
rather
an
autocrat
in
a
sort
of
way
and
besides
she
hated
bother
so
she
did
not
always
consult
the
nuns
and
i
fear
too
after
many
researches
into
that
past
of
hers
which
chaucer
forgot
to
mention
that
she
often
tried
to
evade
rendering
an
account
of
income
and
expenditure
to
them
every
year
as
she
was
supposed
to
do
the
nuns
of
course
objected
to
this
and
the
first
time
the
bishop
came
on
his
rounds
they
complained
about
it
to
him
they
said
too
that
she
was
a
bad
business
woman
and
got
into
debt
and
that
when
she
was
short
of
money
she
used
to
sell
woods
belonging
to
the
convent
and
promise
annual
pensions
to
various
people
in
return
for
lump
sums
down
and
lease
out
farms
for
a
long
time
at
low
rates
and
do
various
other
things
by
which
the
convent
would
lose
in
the
long
run
and
besides
she
had
let
the
roof
of
the
church
get
into
such
ill
repair
that
rain
came
through
the
holes
on
to
their
heads
when
they
were
singing
and
would
my
lord
bishop
please
to
look
at
the
holes
in
their
clothes
and
tell
her
to
provide
them
with
new
ones
other
wicked
prioresses
used
sometimes
even
to
pawn
the
plate
and
jewels
of
the
convent
to
get
money
for
their
own
private
purposes
but
eglentyne
was
not
at
all
wicked
or
dishonest
though
she
was
a
bad
manager
the
fact
was
that
she
had
no
head
for
figures
i
am
that
she
had
no
head
for
figures
you
have
only
got
to
read
chaucer
description
of
her
to
know
that
she
was
not
a
mathematician
besides
the
nuns
were
exaggerating
their
clothes
were
not
in
holes
only
just
a
little
threadbare
madame
eglentyne
was
far
too
fastidious
to
allow
ragged
clothes
about
her
and
as
to
the
roof
of
the
church
she
had
meant
to
save
enough
money
to
have
some
tiles
put
on
to
it
but
it
really
very
hard
to
make
two
ends
meet
in
a
medieval
nunnery
especially
if
as
i
repeat
you
had
no
head
for
figures
probably
the
bishop
saw
how
the
land
lay
so
he
ordered
her
never
to
do
anything
without
consulting
the
convent
and
he
shut
up
the
common
seal
in
a
box
with
three
different
sorts
of
locks
to
which
madame
eglentyne
and
two
of
the
senior
nuns
had
the
keys
so
that
she
could
not
open
it
alone
and
so
could
not
seal
any
business
agreement
without
their
consent
and
he
ordered
her
to
keep
accounts
and
present
them
every
year
there
are
bundles
of
her
accounts
still
preserved
in
the
record
office
finally
he
deputed
a
neighbouring
rector
to
act
as
custodian
of
the
business
affairs
of
the
house
so
that
she
should
always
have
his
help
things
went
better
after
that
eglentyne
it
seems
was
never
really
interested
in
business
and
was
quite
pleased
to
have
her
time
taken
up
with
looking
after
internal
affairs
and
entertaining
visitors
with
an
occasional
jaunt
outside
to
see
how
the
estates
were
getting
on
and
she
began
to
find
that
she
could
lead
a
much
freer
and
gayer
life
now
that
she
was
a
prioress
for
the
prioress
of
a
convent
had
rooms
of
her
own
instead
of
sharing
the
common
dormitory
and
refectory
sometimes
she
even
had
a
sort
of
little
house
with
a
private
kitchen
the
abbess
of
one
great
nunnery
at
winchester
in
the
sixteenth
century
had
her
own
staff
to
look
after
her
a
cook
and
an
under
cook
and
a
housemaid
and
a
gentlewoman
to
wait
upon
her
like
any
great
lady
in
the
world
and
never
dined
with
the
nuns
except
on
state
occasions
but
a
superior
generally
had
with
her
one
nun
to
act
as
her
companion
and
assist
her
in
the
choir
and
be
a
witness
to
her
good
behaviour
this
nun
was
called
her
chaplain
and
was
supposed
to
be
changed
every
year
to
prevent
favouritism
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
madame
eglentyne
went
on
her
pilgrimage
she
took
her
nun
chaplain
with
her
as
well
as
three
priests
that
was
because
no
nun
was
ever
allowed
to
go
out
alone
one
of
madame
eglentyne
duties
as
prioress
was
to
entertain
visitors
with
her
celebrated
cheer
of
court
and
we
may
be
sure
that
she
had
a
great
many
her
sisters
who
were
now
grand
ladies
with
husbands
and
manors
of
their
own
and
her
old
father
and
all
the
great
people
of
the
county
came
to
congratulate
her
and
after
that
they
used
often
to
drop
in
for
a
dinner
of
chickens
and
wine
and
wastel
bread
if
they
passed
the
house
on
a
journey
and
sometimes
they
spent
the
night
there
one
or
two
ladies
whose
husbands
were
away
at
the
wars
or
on
a
pilgrimage
to
rome
even
came
as
paying
guests
to
the
convent
and
lived
there
for
a
whole
year
for
nothing
pleased
the
country
gentlemen
or
wealthy
burgesses
better
than
to
use
nunneries
as
for
their
all
this
was
very
disturbing
to
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
nuns
and
especially
disturbing
were
the
boarders
for
they
wore
gay
clothes
and
had
pet
dogs
and
callers
and
set
a
very
frivolous
example
to
the
nuns
at
one
nunnery
we
find
a
bishop
ordering
felmersham
wife
with
her
whole
household
and
other
women
be
utterly
removed
from
your
monastery
within
one
year
seeing
that
they
are
a
cause
of
disturbance
to
the
nuns
and
an
occasion
to
bad
example
by
reason
of
their
attire
and
of
those
who
come
to
visit
them
it
can
be
easily
imagined
the
bishops
objected
so
much
to
the
reception
of
these
worldly
married
women
as
boarders
just
substitute
for
wife
wife
of
bath
and
all
is
explained
that
lady
was
not
a
person
whom
a
prioress
would
lightly
refuse
the
list
of
her
pilgrimages
alone
would
give
her
the
into
any
nunnery
smiling
her
smile
and
riding
easily
upon
her
ambler
she
would
enter
the
gates
and
what
a
month
of
excitement
would
pass
before
she
rode
away
again
i
am
sure
that
it
was
she
who
taught
madame
eglentyne
the
most
fashionable
way
to
pinch
a
wimple
and
she
certainly
introduced
hats
broad
as
is
a
buckler
or
a
targe
and
scarlet
stockings
into
some
nunneries
the
bishops
disliked
it
all
very
much
but
they
never
succeeded
in
turning
the
boarders
out
for
all
their
efforts
because
the
nuns
always
needed
the
money
which
they
paid
for
their
board
and
lodging
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
this
constant
intercourse
with
worldly
visitors
would
give
rise
to
the
spread
of
worldly
habits
in
madame
eglentyne
nunnery
nuns
after
all
were
but
women
and
they
had
the
amiable
vanities
of
their
sex
but
authority
with
a
large
a
did
not
consider
their
vanities
amiable
at
all
it
was
the
view
of
authority
that
the
devil
had
dispatched
three
lesser
d
to
be
the
damnation
of
nuns
and
those
three
d
were
dances
dresses
and
dogs
medieval
england
was
famous
for
dancing
and
mumming
and
minstrelsy
it
was
merry
england
because
however
plague
and
pestilence
and
famine
and
the
cruelties
of
man
to
man
might
darken
life
still
it
loved
these
things
but
there
were
no
two
views
possible
about
what
the
church
thought
of
dancing
it
was
accurately
summed
up
by
one
moralist
in
the
aphorism
devil
is
the
inventor
and
governor
and
disposer
of
dances
and
dancing
yet
when
we
look
into
those
accounts
which
madame
eglentyne
rendered
or
did
not
render
to
her
nuns
at
the
end
of
every
year
we
shall
find
payments
for
wassail
at
new
year
and
twelfth
night
for
may
games
for
bread
and
ale
on
bonfire
nights
for
harpers
and
players
at
christmas
for
a
present
to
the
boy
bishop
on
his
rounds
and
perhaps
for
an
extra
pittance
when
the
youngest
schoolgirl
was
allowed
to
dress
up
and
act
as
abbess
of
the
convent
for
the
whole
of
innocents
day
and
when
we
look
in
the
bishops
registers
we
shall
find
madame
eglentyne
forbidden
manner
of
minstrelsy
interludes
dancing
or
revelling
within
your
holy
place
and
she
would
be
fortunate
indeed
if
her
bishop
would
make
exception
for
christmas
other
honest
times
of
recreation
among
yourselves
used
in
absence
of
seculars
in
all
wise
somehow
one
feels
an
insistent
conviction
that
her
cheer
of
court
included
dancing
then
again
there
were
the
fashionable
dresses
which
the
visitors
introduced
into
nunneries
it
is
quite
certain
that
madame
eglentyne
was
not
unmoved
by
them
and
it
is
a
sad
fact
that
she
began
to
think
the
monastic
habit
very
black
and
ugly
and
the
monastic
life
very
strict
and
to
decide
that
if
some
little
amenities
were
imported
into
it
no
one
would
be
a
penny
the
worse
and
perhaps
the
bishop
would
not
notice
that
is
why
when
chaucer
met
her
ful
fetis
was
hir
cloke
as
i
was
war
of
smal
coral
aboute
hir
arm
she
bar
a
peire
of
bedes
gauded
al
with
grene
and
heng
a
broche
of
gold
ful
shene
unfortunately
however
the
bishop
did
notice
the
registers
are
indeed
full
of
those
clothes
of
madame
eglentyne
and
of
the
even
more
frivolous
ones
which
she
wore
in
the
privacy
of
the
house
for
more
than
six
weary
centuries
the
bishops
waged
a
holy
war
against
fashion
in
the
cloister
and
waged
it
in
vain
for
as
long
as
nuns
mingled
freely
with
secular
women
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
them
from
adopting
secular
modes
occasionally
a
wretched
bishop
would
find
himself
floundering
unhandily
in
masculine
bewilderment
through
something
like
a
complete
catalogue
of
contemporary
fashions
in
order
to
specify
what
the
nuns
were
to
wear
synods
sat
solemnly
bishops
and
archbishops
shook
their
grey
heads
over
golden
hairpins
and
silver
belts
jewelled
rings
laced
shoes
slashed
tunics
low
necks
and
long
trains
gay
colours
costly
cloth
and
valuable
furs
the
nuns
were
supposed
to
wear
their
veils
pinned
tightly
down
to
their
eyebrows
so
that
their
foreheads
were
completely
hidden
but
high
foreheads
happened
to
be
fashionable
among
worldly
ladies
who
even
shaved
theirs
to
make
them
higher
and
the
result
was
that
the
nuns
could
not
resist
lifting
up
and
spreading
out
their
veils
for
how
otherwise
did
chaucer
that
madame
eglentyne
had
such
a
fair
forehead
a
spanne
broad
i
trowe
if
she
had
been
wearing
her
veil
properly
it
would
have
been
invisible
and
the
father
of
english
poetry
may
be
observed
discreetly
but
plainly
winking
the
other
eye
when
he
puts
in
that
little
touch
his
contemporaries
would
see
the
point
very
quickly
and
that
brooch
and
that
fetis
cloak
of
hers
here
is
what
some
nuns
told
the
bishop
of
lincoln
about
their
prioress
fifty
years
after
chaucer
wrote
the
prioress
they
said
with
their
most
sanctimonious
air
wears
golden
rings
exceeding
costly
with
divers
precious
stones
and
also
girdles
silvered
and
gilded
over
and
silken
veils
and
she
carries
her
veil
too
high
above
her
forehead
so
that
her
forehead
being
entirely
uncovered
can
be
seen
of
all
and
she
wears
furs
of
vair
also
she
wears
shifts
of
cloth
of
rennes
which
costs
sixteen
pence
the
ell
also
she
wears
kirtles
laced
with
silk
and
tiring
pins
of
silver
and
silver
gilt
and
has
made
all
the
nuns
wear
the
like
also
she
wears
above
her
veil
a
cap
of
estate
furred
with
budge
item
she
has
on
her
neck
a
long
silken
band
in
english
a
lace
which
hangs
down
below
her
breast
and
there
on
a
golden
ring
with
one
diamond
is
it
not
madame
eglentyne
to
the
life
nothing
escaped
our
good
dan
chaucer
eye
for
all
that
he
rode
always
looking
on
the
ground
moreover
it
was
not
only
in
her
dress
that
the
prioress
and
her
sister
nuns
aped
the
fashions
of
the
world
great
ladies
of
the
day
loved
to
amuse
themselves
with
pet
animals
and
nuns
were
quick
to
follow
their
example
so
of
smale
houndes
had
she
that
she
fedde
with
rosted
flesh
or
milk
and
but
sore
weep
she
if
oon
of
hem
were
deed
or
if
men
smoot
it
with
a
yerde
smerte
the
visitation
reports
are
full
of
those
little
dogs
and
other
animals
and
how
many
readers
of
the
prologue
know
that
the
smale
houndes
like
the
fair
forehead
and
the
brooch
of
gold
full
sheen
were
strictly
against
the
rules
for
the
bishops
regarded
pets
as
bad
for
discipline
and
century
after
century
they
tried
to
turn
the
animals
out
of
the
convents
without
the
slightest
success
the
nuns
just
waited
till
the
bishop
had
gone
and
then
whistled
their
dogs
back
again
dogs
were
easily
the
favourite
pets
though
monkeys
squirrels
rabbits
birds
and
very
rarely
cats
were
also
kept
one
archbishop
had
to
forbid
an
abbess
whom
he
visited
to
keep
and
a
number
of
in
her
own
chamber
and
charged
her
at
the
same
time
with
stinting
her
nuns
in
food
one
can
guess
what
became
of
the
roasted
flesh
or
milk
and
it
was
a
common
medieval
practice
to
bring
animals
into
church
where
ladies
often
attended
service
with
dog
in
lap
and
men
with
hawk
on
wrist
just
as
the
highland
farmer
brings
his
collie
with
him
today
this
happened
in
the
nunneries
too
sometimes
it
was
the
in
the
convents
who
brought
their
pets
with
them
there
is
a
pathetic
complaint
by
the
nuns
of
one
house
lady
audley
who
boards
there
has
a
great
abundance
of
dogs
insomuch
that
whenever
she
comes
to
church
there
follow
her
twelve
dogs
who
make
a
great
uproar
in
church
hindering
the
nuns
in
their
psalmody
and
the
nuns
thereby
are
terrified
but
often
enough
the
nuns
themselves
transgressed
injunctions
against
bringing
pet
dogs
into
choir
occur
in
several
visitation
reports
the
most
amusing
instance
being
contained
in
those
sent
to
romsey
abbey
by
william
of
wykeham
in
just
about
the
same
year
that
chaucer
was
writing
the
runs
the
injunction
we
have
convinced
ourselves
by
clear
proofs
that
some
of
the
nuns
of
your
house
bring
with
them
to
church
birds
rabbits
hounds
and
such
like
frivolous
things
whereunto
they
give
more
heed
than
to
the
offices
of
the
church
with
frequent
hindrance
to
their
own
psalmody
and
to
that
of
their
fellow
nuns
and
to
the
grievous
peril
of
their
souls
therefore
we
strictly
forbid
you
all
and
several
in
virtue
of
the
obedience
due
to
us
that
ye
presume
henceforward
to
bring
to
church
no
birds
hounds
rabbits
or
other
frivolous
things
that
promote
indiscipline
item
whereas
through
hunting
dogs
and
other
hounds
abiding
within
your
monastic
precincts
the
alms
that
should
be
given
to
the
poor
are
devoured
and
the
church
and
cloister
are
foully
defiled
and
whereas
through
their
inordinate
noise
divine
service
is
frequently
troubled
therefore
we
strictly
command
and
enjoin
you
lady
abbess
that
you
remove
the
dogs
altogether
and
that
you
suffer
them
never
henceforth
nor
any
other
such
hounds
to
abide
within
the
precincts
of
your
nunnery
but
it
was
useless
for
any
bishop
to
order
madame
eglentyne
to
give
up
her
dogs
she
could
not
even
be
parted
from
them
on
a
pilgrimage
though
they
must
have
been
a
great
nuisance
in
the
inns
especially
as
she
was
so
fussy
about
their
food
for
chaucer
prioress
we
must
admit
was
rather
a
worldly
lady
though
her
pretty
clothes
and
little
dogs
were
harmless
enough
on
modern
standards
and
one
sympathies
are
all
against
the
bishops
she
probably
became
more
worldly
as
time
went
on
because
she
had
so
many
opportunities
for
social
intercourse
not
only
had
she
to
entertain
visitors
in
the
convent
but
often
the
business
of
the
house
took
her
away
upon
journeys
and
these
offered
many
opportunities
for
hobnobbing
with
her
neighbours
sometimes
she
had
to
go
to
london
to
see
after
a
and
that
was
a
great
excursion
with
another
nun
or
perhaps
two
and
a
priest
and
several
yeomen
to
look
after
her
sometimes
she
had
to
go
and
see
the
bishop
to
get
permission
to
take
in
some
little
schoolgirls
sometimes
she
went
to
the
funeral
of
a
great
man
whom
her
father
knew
and
who
left
her
twenty
shillings
and
a
silver
cup
in
his
will
sometimes
she
went
to
the
wedding
of
one
of
her
sisters
or
to
be
godmother
to
their
babies
though
the
bishops
did
not
like
these
worldly
ties
or
the
dances
and
which
accompanied
weddings
and
christenings
indeed
her
nuns
occasionally
complained
about
her
journeys
and
said
that
though
she
pretended
it
was
all
on
the
business
of
the
house
they
had
their
doubts
and
would
the
bishop
please
just
look
into
it
at
one
nunnery
we
find
the
nuns
complaining
that
their
house
is
in
debt
this
principally
owing
to
the
costly
expenses
of
the
prioress
because
she
frequently
rides
abroad
and
pretends
that
she
does
so
on
the
common
business
of
the
house
although
it
is
not
so
with
a
train
of
attendants
much
too
large
and
tarries
too
long
abroad
and
she
feasts
sumptuously
both
when
abroad
and
at
home
and
she
is
very
choice
in
her
dress
so
that
the
fur
trimmings
of
her
mantle
are
worth
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
nothing
of
which
the
church
disapproved
more
than
this
habit
shared
by
monks
and
nuns
of
wandering
about
outside
their
cloisters
moralists
considered
that
intercourse
with
the
world
was
at
the
root
of
all
the
evil
which
crept
into
the
monastic
system
the
orthodox
saying
was
that
a
monk
out
of
his
cloister
was
like
a
fish
out
of
water
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
chaucer
monk
thought
the
text
not
worth
an
oyster
indeed
most
of
the
monks
managed
to
swim
very
well
in
the
air
and
the
nuns
too
persisted
in
taking
every
sort
of
excuse
for
wandering
in
the
world
right
through
the
middle
ages
council
after
council
bishop
after
bishop
reformer
after
reformer
tried
in
vain
to
keep
them
shut
up
the
greatest
attempt
of
all
began
in
when
the
pope
published
a
bull
ordering
that
nuns
should
never
save
in
very
exceptional
circumstances
leave
their
convents
and
that
no
secular
person
should
be
allowed
to
go
in
and
visit
them
without
a
special
licence
and
a
good
reason
this
will
make
the
modern
reader
pity
the
poor
nuns
but
there
is
no
need
for
nobody
ever
succeeded
in
putting
it
into
force
for
more
than
five
minutes
though
the
bishops
spent
over
two
centuries
in
trying
to
do
so
and
were
still
trying
in
vain
when
king
henry
viii
dissolved
the
nunneries
and
turned
all
the
nuns
out
into
the
world
for
ever
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
at
one
nunnery
in
the
lincoln
diocese
when
the
bishop
came
and
deposited
a
copy
of
the
bull
in
the
house
and
ordered
the
nuns
to
obey
it
they
ran
after
him
to
the
gate
when
he
was
riding
away
and
threw
the
bull
at
his
head
screaming
that
they
would
never
observe
it
the
more
practical
bishops
indeed
soon
stopped
trying
to
enforce
the
bull
as
it
stood
and
contented
themselves
with
ordering
that
nuns
were
not
to
go
out
or
pay
visits
too
often
or
without
a
companion
or
without
licence
or
without
a
good
reason
but
even
in
this
they
were
not
very
successful
because
the
nuns
were
most
prolific
in
excellent
reasons
why
they
should
go
out
sometimes
they
said
that
their
parents
were
ill
and
then
they
would
go
away
to
smooth
the
pillow
of
the
sick
sometimes
they
said
that
they
had
to
go
to
market
to
buy
herrings
sometimes
they
said
that
they
had
to
go
to
confession
at
a
monastery
sometimes
it
is
really
difficult
to
imagine
they
said
what
are
we
to
think
for
instance
of
that
giddy
nun
on
monday
night
did
pass
the
night
with
the
austin
friars
at
northampton
and
did
dance
and
play
the
lute
with
them
in
the
same
place
until
midnight
and
on
the
night
following
she
passed
the
night
with
the
friars
preachers
at
northampton
luting
and
dancing
in
like
manner
chaucer
told
us
how
the
friar
loved
harping
and
how
his
eyes
twinkled
like
stars
in
his
head
when
he
sang
but
failed
perhaps
to
observe
that
he
had
lured
madame
eglentyne
into
a
dance
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
see
what
excuses
the
nuns
can
have
made
for
all
their
wandering
about
in
the
streets
and
the
fields
and
in
and
out
of
people
houses
and
it
is
sorely
to
be
feared
that
either
they
were
too
much
of
a
handful
for
madame
eglentyne
or
else
she
winked
at
their
doings
for
somehow
or
other
one
suspects
that
she
had
no
great
opinion
of
bishops
after
all
chaucer
would
never
have
met
her
if
she
had
not
managed
to
circumvent
her
own
since
if
there
was
one
excuse
for
wandering
of
which
the
bishops
thoroughly
disapproved
it
was
precisely
the
excuse
of
pilgrimages
madame
eglentyne
was
not
quite
as
simple
and
coy
as
she
looked
how
many
of
the
literary
critics
who
chuckle
over
her
know
that
she
never
ought
to
have
got
into
the
prologue
at
all
the
church
was
quite
clear
in
its
mind
that
pilgrimages
for
nuns
were
to
be
discouraged
as
early
as
a
council
had
forbidden
the
practice
and
in
another
at
york
decreed
order
that
the
opportunity
of
wandering
may
be
taken
from
nuns
we
forbid
them
to
take
the
path
of
pilgrimage
in
an
archbishop
of
york
strictly
forbade
the
nuns
of
one
convent
to
leave
their
house
reason
of
any
vow
of
pilgrimage
which
they
might
have
taken
if
any
had
taken
such
vows
she
was
to
say
as
many
psalters
as
it
would
have
taken
days
to
perform
the
pilgrimage
so
rashly
vowed
one
has
a
melancholy
vision
of
poor
madame
eglentyne
saying
psalters
interminably
through
her
tretys
nose
instead
of
jogging
along
so
gaily
with
her
motley
companions
and
telling
so
prettily
her
tale
of
little
st
hugh
such
prohibitions
might
be
multiplied
from
medieval
records
and
indeed
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
further
than
chaucer
to
understand
why
it
was
that
bishops
offered
such
strenuous
opposition
to
pilgrimages
for
nuns
one
has
only
to
remember
some
of
the
folk
in
whose
company
the
prioress
travelled
and
some
of
the
tales
they
told
if
one
could
only
be
certain
for
instance
that
she
rode
all
the
time
with
her
nun
and
her
priests
or
at
least
between
the
knight
and
the
poor
parson
of
a
town
but
there
were
also
the
miller
and
the
summoner
and
worst
of
all
that
cheerful
and
engaging
sinner
the
wife
of
bath
it
is
really
quite
disturbing
to
think
what
additional
details
the
wife
of
bath
may
have
given
the
prioress
about
her
five
husbands
this
then
was
chaucer
prioress
in
real
life
for
the
poet
who
drew
her
was
one
of
the
most
wonderful
observers
in
the
whole
of
english
literature
we
may
wade
through
hundreds
of
visitation
reports
and
injunctions
and
everywhere
the
grey
eyes
of
his
prioress
will
twinkle
at
us
out
of
their
pages
and
in
the
end
we
must
always
go
to
chaucer
for
her
picture
to
sum
up
everything
that
historical
records
have
taught
us
as
the
bishop
found
her
so
he
saw
her
aristocratic
worldly
taking
pains
to
there
of
court
liking
pretty
clothes
and
little
dogs
a
lady
of
importance
attended
by
a
nun
and
three
priests
spoken
to
with
respect
by
the
none
too
host
no
corpus
dominus
or
bones
or
on
a
devel
wey
for
her
but
neer
my
lady
prioress
and
my
lady
prioresse
by
your
leve
if
that
i
wiste
i
sholde
yow
nat

i

demen
that
ye

a
tale
next
if
so
were
that
ye
wolde
now
wol
ye
my
lady
dere
he
talks
to
no
one
else
like
that
save
perhaps
to
the
knight
was
she
religious
perhaps
but
save
for
her
singing
the
divine
service
and
for
her
lovely
address
to
the
virgin
at
the
beginning
of
her
tale
chaucer
can
find
but
little
to
say
on
the
point
but
for
speken
of
hir
conscience
he
says
she
was
so
charitable
and
so
pitous
and
then
as
we
are
waiting
to
hear
of
her
almsgiving
to
the
poor
that
she
would
weep
over
a
mouse
in
a
trap
or
a
beaten
puppy
says
chaucer
a
good
ruler
of
her
house
again
doubtless
but
when
chaucer
met
her
the
house
was
ruling
itself
somewhere
at
the
ende
the
world
was
full
of
fish
out
of
water
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
by
sëynt
loy
said
madame
eglentyne
swearing
her
greatest
oath
like
monk
she
held
that
famous
text
not
worth
an
oyster
so
we
take
our
leave
of
her
characteristically
on
the
road
to
canterbury
chapter
v
ménagier
a
paris
housewife
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
sphere
of
woman
is
the
home
the
men
of
the
middle
as
indeed
of
all
ages
including
our
own
were
very
fond
of
writing
books
of
deportment
telling
women
how
they
ought
to
behave
in
all
the
circumstances
of
their
existence
but
more
particularly
in
their
relations
with
their
husbands
many
of
these
books
have
survived
and
among
them
one
which
is
of
particular
interest
because
of
the
robust
good
sense
of
its
writer
and
the
intimate
and
lively
picture
which
it
gives
of
a
bourgeois
home
most
books
of
deportment
were
written
so
to
speak
in
the
air
for
women
in
general
but
this
was
written
by
a
particular
husband
for
a
particular
wife
and
thus
is
drawn
from
life
and
full
of
detail
showing
throughout
an
individuality
which
its
compeers
too
often
lack
if
a
parallel
be
sought
to
it
it
is
perhaps
to
be
found
not
in
any
other
medieval
treatise
but
in
those
passages
of
xenophon
in
which
isomachus
describes
to
socrates
the
training
of
a
perfect
greek
wife
the
ménagier
de
paris
the
householder
or
goodman
of
paris
as
we
might
say
wrote
this
book
for
the
instruction
of
his
young
wife
between
and
he
was
a
wealthy
man
not
without
learning
and
of
great
experience
in
affairs
obviously
a
member
of
that
solid
and
enlightened
upon
which
the
french
monarchy
was
coming
to
lean
with
confidence
when
he
wrote
he
must
have
been
approaching
old
age
and
he
was
certainly
over
sixty
but
he
had
recently
married
a
young
wife
of
higher
birth
than
himself
an
orphan
from
a
different
province
he
speaks
several
times
of
her
great
youth
and
kept
a
sort
of
with
her
to
help
and
direct
her
in
the
management
of
his
house
and
indeed
like
the
wife
of
isomachus
she
was
only
fifteen
years
old
when
he
married
her
modern
opinion
is
shocked
by
a
discrepancy
in
age
between
husband
and
wife
with
which
the
middle
ages
a
time
of
de
was
more
familiar
the
ménagier
says
you
see
ever
so
old
a
man
who
will
not
marry
a
young
woman
yet
his
attitude
towards
his
young
wife
shows
us
that
there
may
have
been
compensations
even
in
a
marriage
between
may
and
january
time
after
time
in
his
book
there
sounds
the
note
of
a
tenderness
which
is
paternal
rather
than
marital
a
sympathetic
understanding
of
the
feelings
of
a
wedded
child
which
a
younger
man
might
not
have
compassed
over
all
the
counsels
there
seems
to
hang
something
of
the
mellow
sadness
of
an
autumn
evening
when
beauty
and
death
go
ever
hand
in
hand
it
was
his
wife
function
to
make
comfortable
his
declining
years
but
it
was
his
to
make
the
task
easy
for
her
he
constantly
repeats
the
assurance
that
he
does
not
ask
of
her
an
overweening
respect
or
a
service
too
humble
or
too
hard
for
such
is
not
due
to
him
he
desires
only
such
care
as
his
neighbours
and
kinswomen
take
of
their
husbands
to
me
belongeth
none
save
the
common
service
or
less
in
his
prologue
addressed
to
her
he
gives
a
charming
picture
of
the
scene
which
led
him
to
write
his
book
being
of
the
age
of
fifteen
years
and
in
the
week
that
you
and
i
were
wed
did
pray
me
that
i
would
please
to
be
indulgent
to
your
youth
and
to
your
small
and
ignorant
service
mewards
until
that
you
should
have
seen
and
learned
more
to
the
hastening
whereof
you
did
promise
me
to
set
all
care
and
diligence
praying
me
humbly
in
our
bed
as
i
remember
that
for
the
love
of
god
i
would
not
correct
you
harshly
before
strangers
nor
before
our
own
folk
that
i
would
correct
you
each
night
or
from
day
to
day
in
our
chamber
and
show
you
the
unseemly
or
foolish
things
done
in
the
day
or
days
past
and
chastise
you
if
it
pleased
me
and
then
you
would
not
fail
to
amend
yourself
according
to
my
teaching
and
correction
and
would
do
all
in
your
power
according
to
my
will
as
you
said
and
i
thought
well
of
and
praise
and
thank
you
for
what
you
said
to
me
and
i
have
often
remembered
it
since
and
know
dear
sister
d
that
all
that
i
know
you
have
done
since
we
were
wed
up
to
this
day
and
all
that
you
shall
do
hereafter
with
good
intent
has
been
and
is
good
and
well
hath
pleased
pleases
and
shall
please
me
for
your
youth
excuses
you
from
being
very
wise
and
will
still
excuse
you
in
everything
that
you
do
with
good
intent
to
please
me
and
know
that
it
doth
not
displease
but
rather
pleases
me
that
you
should
have
roses
to
grow
and
violets
to
care
for
and
that
you
should
make
chaplets
and
dance
and
sing
and
i
would
well
that
you
should
so
continue
among
our
friends
and
those
of
our
estate
and
it
is
but
right
and
seemly
thus
to
pass
the
time
of
your
feminine
youth
provided
that
you
desire
and
offer
not
to
go
to
the
feasts
and
dances
of
too
great
lords
for
that
is
not
seemly
for
you
nor
suitable
to
your
estate
nor
mine
footnote
d
he
addresses
her
throughout
as
a
term
of
affectionate
respect
meanwhile
he
has
not
forgotten
her
request
that
he
would
teach
and
correct
her
in
private
and
so
he
writes
a
little
book
but
it
was
a
big
book
before
he
had
finished
to
show
her
how
to
comport
herself
for
he
is
sorry
for
this
child
who
has
for
long
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
who
is
far
from
kinswomen
who
might
counsel
her
having
only
he
says
whom
you
have
been
taken
from
your
kinsfolk
and
from
the
land
of
your
birth
he
has
often
deliberated
the
matter
and
now
here
is
easy
general
introduction
to
the
whole
art
of
being
a
wife
a
housewife
and
a
perfect
lady
one
characteristic
reason
apart
from
his
desire
to
help
her
and
to
be
comfortable
himself
for
he
was
set
in
his
ways
he
gives
for
his
trouble
and
recurs
to
from
time
to
time
surely
the
strangest
ever
given
by
a
husband
for
instructing
his
wife
he
is
old
he
says
and
must
die
before
her
and
it
is
positively
essential
that
she
should
do
him
credit
with
her
second
husband
what
a
reflection
upon
him
if
she
accompanied
his
successor
to
mass
with
the
collar
of
her
crumpled
or
if
she
knew
not
how
to
keep
fleas
from
the
blankets
or
how
to
order
a
supper
for
twelve
in
lent
it
is
characteristic
of
the
ménagier
reasonableness
and
solid
sense
that
he
regards
his
young
wife
second
marriage
with
equanimity
one
of
his
sections
is
headed
you
should
be
loving
to
your
husband
whether
myself
or
another
by
the
example
of
sarah
rebecca
rachel
how
different
from
those
husbands
or
anxious
for
the
future
of
their
children
under
a
possibly
harsh
stepfather
whose
wills
so
often
reveal
them
trying
to
bind
their
wives
to
perpetual
celibacy
after
their
deaths
such
husbands
as
william
earl
of
pembroke
who
died
in
admonishing
his
lady
wyfe
ye
remember
your
promise
to
me
to
take
the
ordere
of
wydowhood
as
ye
may
be
the
better
mastre
of
your
owne
to
performe
my
wylle
the
plan
of
the
book
three
sections
containing
nineteen
principal
articles
is
most
exhaustive
the
first
section
deals
with
religious
and
moral
duties
in
the
words
of
the
ménagier
first
section
is
necessary
to
gain
for
you
the
love
of
god
and
the
salvation
of
your
soul
and
also
to
win
for
you
the
love
of
your
husband
and
to
give
you
in
this
world
that
peace
which
ought
to
be
had
in
marriage
and
because
these
two
things
to
wit
the
salvation
of
your
soul
and
the
comfort
of
your
husband
are
the
two
things
most
chiefly
necessary
therefore
are
they
here
placed
first
then
follows
a
series
of
articles
telling
the
lady
how
to
say
her
morning
prayer
when
she
rises
how
to
bear
herself
at
mass
and
in
what
form
to
make
her
confession
to
the
priest
together
with
a
long
and
somewhat
alarming
discursus
upon
the
seven
deadly
sins
which
it
assuredly
never
entered
into
her
sleek
little
head
to
commit
and
another
on
the
corresponding
virtues
but
the
greater
part
of
the
section
deals
with
the
subject
of
the
wife
duty
to
her
husband
she
is
to
be
loving
humble
obedient
careful
and
thoughtful
for
his
person
silent
regarding
his
secrets
and
patient
if
he
be
foolish
and
allow
his
heart
to
stray
towards
other
women
the
whole
section
is
illustrated
by
a
series
of
stories
known
as
in
the
middle
ages
culled
from
the
bible
from
the
common
stock
of
anecdotes
possessed
by
jongleur
and
preacher
alike
and
most
interesting
of
all
from
the
ménagier
own
experience
among
the
ménagier
longer
illustrations
is
the
favourite
but
intolerably
dull
moral
tale
of
melibeu
and
prudence
by
albertano
of
brescia
translated
into
french
by
renault
de
louens
whose
version
the
ménagier
copied
and
adapted
by
jean
de
meung
in
the
de
la
from
which
in
turn
chaucer
took
it
to
tell
to
the
canterbury
pilgrims
here
also
are
to
be
found
petrarch
famous
tale
of
patient
griselda
which
chaucer
also
took
and
gave
a
wider
fame
and
a
long
poem
written
in
by
jean
bruyant
a
notary
of
the
châtelet
at
paris
and
called
way
of
poverty
and
wealth
inculcating
diligence
and
prudence
the
second
section
of
the
book
deals
with
household
management
and
is
far
the
most
interesting
the
range
of
the
ménagier
knowledge
leaves
the
reader
gasping
the
man
is
a
perfect
mrs
beeton
the
section
comprises
a
detailed
treatise
on
gardening
and
another
on
the
principles
which
should
govern
the
engagement
of
servants
and
the
method
by
which
they
should
be
managed
when
hired
the
modern
problem
of
servants
who
leave
does
not
seem
to
have
presented
itself
to
him
there
are
instructions
how
to
mend
air
and
clean
dresses
and
furs
get
out
grease
spots
catch
fleas
and
keep
flies
out
of
the
bedroom
look
after
wine
and
superintend
the
management
of
a
farm
at
one
point
he
breaks
off
addressing
his
wife
thus
will
i
leave
you
to
rest
or
to
play
and
will
speak
no
more
to
you
and
while
you
disport
yourself
elsewhere
i
will
speak
to
master
john
the
steward
who
looks
after
our
possessions
so
that
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
any
of
our
horses
whether
for
the
plough
or
for
riding
or
if
it
is
necessary
to
buy
or
exchange
a
horse
he
may
know
a
little
of
that
it
behoves
him
to
know
in
this
matter
there
follow
several
pages
of
wise
advice
as
to
the
good
points
of
horses
how
to
examine
them
and
to
find
their
ages
and
defects
under
the
eye
of
the
horse
dealer
the
practical
of
a
man
who
evidently
knew
and
loved
his
horses
together
with
advice
upon
the
treatment
of
their
various
diseases
among
the
various
recipes
which
the
ménagier
gives
to
this
intent
are
two
charms
for
instance
a
horse
has
glanders
you
must
say
to
him
these
three
words
with
three
paternosters
etc
last
but
not
least
there
is
a
magnificent
cookery
book
arranged
in
the
form
sacred
to
cookery
books
from
that
day
to
this
beginning
with
a
list
of
specimen
menus
for
dinners
and
suppers
hot
or
cold
fast
or
feast
summer
or
winter
giving
hints
on
the
choice
of
meat
poultry
and
spices
and
ending
with
a
long
series
of
recipes
for
all
manner
of
soups
stews
sauces
and
other
viands
with
an
excursus
on
invalid
cookery
the
third
section
of
the
book
was
intended
by
the
ménagier
to
contain
three
parts
first
of
all
a
number
of
parlour
games
for
indoor
amusement
secondly
a
treatise
on
hawking
the
favourite
outdoor
amusement
of
ladies
and
thirdly
a
list
of
amusing
riddles
and
games
of
an
arithmetical
kind
counting
and
numbering
subtle
to
find
out
or
guess
presumably
of
the
nature
of
our
old
friend
a
herring
and
a
half
cost
three
unfortunately
the
ménagier
seems
never
to
have
finished
the
book
and
of
this
section
only
the
treatise
on
hawking
has
survived
it
is
a
great
pity
for
we
have
several
such
treatises
and
how
interesting
an
account
of
indoor
games
and
riddles
might
have
been
we
may
guess
from
a
passage
in
the
ménagier
version
of
the
story
of
lucrece
when
he
describes
the
roman
ladies
gossiping
others
playing
at
others
at
others
at
others
at
cards
or
other
games
of
pleasure
with
their
neighbours
others
who
had
supped
together
were
singing
songs
and
telling
fables
and
stories
and
wagers
others
were
in
the
street
with
their
neighbours
playing
at
blind
man
buff
or
at
and
at
several
other
games
of
the
kind
in
those
days
before
the
invention
of
printing
had
made
books
plentiful
medieval
ladies
were
largely
dependent
for
amusement
upon
telling
and
listening
to
stories
asking
riddles
and
playing
games
which
we
have
long
ago
banished
to
the
nursery
and
a
plentiful
repertoire
of
such
amusements
was
very
desirable
in
a
hostess
the
ménagier
was
clearly
anxious
that
his
wife
should
shine
in
the
amenities
as
well
as
in
the
duties
of
social
life
such
was
the
monumental
work
which
the
ménagier
de
paris
was
able
to
present
to
his
awed
but
admiring
wife
and
though
it
has
been
sadly
neglected
by
historians
it
deserves
to
be
well
known
for
it
gives
us
a
picture
of
a
medieval
housewife
which
it
would
be
hard
indeed
to
surpass
there
is
hardly
a
side
of
her
daily
life
upon
which
it
does
not
touch
and
we
may
now
with
advantage
look
more
closely
upon
her
and
see
in
turn
the
perfect
lady
whose
deportment
and
manners
do
credit
to
her
breeding
the
perfect
wife
whose
submission
to
her
husband
is
only
equalled
by
her
skill
in
ministering
to
his
ease
the
perfect
mistress
whose
servants
love
her
and
run
her
house
like
clockwork
and
the
perfect
housewife
the
mrs
beeton
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
ménagier
views
on
deportment
are
incongruously
sandwiched
into
his
section
on
spiritual
duties
under
the
general
headings
of
getting
up
in
the
morning
and
going
to
church
his
ideas
on
the
subject
of
clothes
are
very
clearly
defined
a
sweet
disorder
in
the
dress
was
in
no
way
to
his
taste
know
dear
sister
that
if
you
wish
to
follow
my
advice
you
will
have
great
care
and
regard
for
what
you
and
i
can
afford
to
do
according
to
our
estate
have
a
care
that
you
be
honestly
clad
without
new
devices
and
without
too
much
or
too
little
frippery
and
before
you
leave
your
chamber
and
house
take
care
first
that
the
collar
of
your
shift
and
of
your
and
do
not
hang
out
one
over
the
other
as
happens
with
certain
drunken
foolish
or
witless
women
who
have
no
care
for
their
honour
nor
for
the
honesty
of
their
estate
or
of
their
husbands
and
who
walk
with
roving
eyes
and
head
horribly
reared
up
like
a
lion
teste
espoventablement
levée
comme
un
lyon
their
hair
straggling
out
of
their
wimples
and
the
collars
of
their
shifts
and
crumpled
the
one
upon
the
other
and
who
walk
mannishly
and
bear
themselves
uncouthly
before
folk
without
shame
and
if
one
speaks
to
them
about
it
they
excuse
themselves
on
the
ground
of
their
industry
and
humility
saying
that
they
are
so
diligent
hardworking
and
humble
that
they
care
not
for
themselves
but
they
lie
they
care
so
much
for
themselves
that
if
they
were
in
an
honourable
company
never
would
they
be
willing
that
men
should
wait
less
upon
them
than
upon
the
wiser
ladies
of
like
lineage
with
themselves
nor
that
they
should
have
fewer
salutations
bows
reverences
and
speech
than
the
rest
but
rather
they
desire
more
and
they
are
unworthy
of
it
for
they
know
not
how
to
maintain
their
own
honourable
fame
nay
nor
the
fame
of
their
husbands
and
of
their
lineage
which
they
bring
to
shame
therefore
fair
sister
have
a
care
that
your
hair
wimple
kerchief
and
hood
and
all
the
rest
of
your
attire
be
well
arranged
and
decently
ordered
that
none
who
see
you
can
laugh
or
mock
at
you
but
that
all
the
others
may
find
in
you
an
example
of
fair
and
simple
and
decent
array
when
you
go
to
town
or
to
church
go
suitably
accompanied
by
honourable
women
according
to
your
estate
and
flee
suspicious
company
never
allowing
any
ill
famed
woman
to
be
seen
in
your
presence
and
as
you
go
bear
your
head
upright
and
your
eyelids
low
and
without
fluttering
and
look
straight
in
front
of
you
about
four
rods
ahead
without
looking
round
at
any
man
or
woman
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
nor
looking
up
nor
glancing
from
place
to
place
nor
stopping
to
speak
to
anyone
on
the
road
such
was
the
model
of
female
deportment
in
the
middle
ages
let
us
pass
from
the
lady
to
the
wife
on
the
attitude
of
wife
to
husband
the
ménagier
ideas
are
much
the
same
as
those
of
the
rest
of
his
age
they
may
be
summed
up
as
submission
obedience
and
constant
attention
she
must
be
buxom
at
bed
and
at
board
even
in
circumstances
when
buxomness
hides
a
heavy
heart
the
good
sense
of
the
burgess
does
not
prevent
him
from
likening
the
wife
love
for
her
husband
to
the
fidelity
of
domestic
animals
towards
their
masters
the
domestic
animals
you
see
how
a
greyhound
or
a
mastiff
or
a
little
dog
whether
on
the
road
or
at
table
or
in
bed
always
keeps
near
to
the
person
from
whom
he
takes
his
food
and
leaves
and
is
shy
and
fierce
with
all
others
and
if
the
dog
is
afar
off
he
always
has
his
heart
and
his
eye
upon
his
master
even
if
his
master
whip
him
and
throw
stones
at
him
the
dog
follows
wagging
his
tail
and
lying
down
before
his
master
seeks
to
mollify
him
and
through
rivers
through
woods
through
thieves
and
through
battles
follows
him
wherefore
for
a
better
and
stronger
reason
women
to
whom
god
has
given
natural
sense
and
who
are
reasonable
ought
to
have
a
perfect
and
solemn
love
for
their
husbands
and
so
i
pray
you
to
be
very
loving
and
privy
with
your
husband
who
shall
be
patience
is
an
essential
quality
in
wives
and
however
sorely
tried
they
must
never
complain
the
ménagier
tells
three
stories
to
illustrate
how
a
wife
should
bear
herself
in
order
to
win
back
the
love
of
an
unfaithful
husband
one
of
these
is
the
famous
tale
of
griselda
but
the
two
others
are
drawn
so
he
says
from
his
own
experience
in
the
first
of
these
he
tells
of
the
wife
of
a
famous
in
the
of
paris
who
saw
to
the
nurture
and
marriage
of
her
husband
illegitimate
daughter
did
he
ever
perceive
it
by
one
reproach
or
one
angry
or
ugly
word
the
second
is
the
charmingly
told
story
of
how
john
quentin
wife
won
back
her
husband
heart
from
the
poor
spinner
of
wool
to
whom
it
had
strayed
all
seem
to
show
that
the
ménagier
simile
of
the
little
dog
was
selected
with
care
for
the
medieval
wife
like
the
dog
was
expected
to
lick
the
hand
that
smote
her
nevertheless
while
subscribing
to
all
the
usual
standards
of
his
age
the
ménagier
robust
sense
his
hold
upon
the
realities
of
life
kept
him
from
pushing
them
too
far
the
comment
of
another
realist
chaucer
on
the
tale
of
patient
griselda
will
be
remembered

his
creation
of
the
wife
of
bath
was
an
even
more
pointed
commentary
here
is
what
the
ménagier
has
to
say
to
his
young
wife
on
the
same
subject
and
i
who
have
put
the
tale
of
griselda
here
only
to
teach
you
have
not
put
it
here
to
apply
it
to
you
for
i
am
not
worthy
thereof
and
i
am
not
a
marquis
and
i
have
not
taken
you
as
a
beggar
nor
am
i
so
foolish
so
conceited
or
so
lacking
in
sense
that
i
know
not
that
is
not
for
me
to
assault
nor
to
assay
you
thus
nor
in
like
manner
god
keep
me
from
trying
you
thus
under
colour
of
false
simulations
and
forgive
me
that
the
story
speaks
in
my
opinion
of
too
great
cruelty
and
beyond
reason
and
know
that
it
never
befel
so
but
thus
the
tale
runs
and
i
may
nor
correct
nor
alter
it
for
a
wiser
than
i
hath
made
it
and
it
is
my
desire
that
since
others
have
read
it
you
also
may
know
and
be
able
to
talk
about
everything
even
as
other
folk
do
moreover
in
spite
of
the
ideal
of
submission
which
he
sets
before
his
wife
the
ménagier
has
some
charming
words
to
say
about
love
with
a
sigh
perhaps
for
his
own
advanced
though
not
crabbed
age
and
a
glance
at
that
younger
husband
of
the
future
who
shall
one
day
enjoy
his
little
bride
in
god
name
he
says
i
believe
that
when
two
good
and
honourable
people
are
wed
all
other
loves
are
put
far
off
destroyed
and
forgotten
save
only
the
love
of
each
for
the
other
and
meseems
that
when
they
are
in
each
other
presence
they
look
upon
each
other
more
than
upon
the
others
they
clasp
and
hold
each
other
and
they
do
not
willingly
speak
or
make
sign
save
to
each
other
and
when
they
are
separated
they
think
of
each
other
and
say
in
their
hearts
i
see
him
i
shall
do
thus
and
thus
to
him
or
say
this
to
him
i
shall
beseech
him
concerning
this
or
that
and
all
their
special
pleasure
their
chief
desire
and
their
perfect
joy
is
to
do
pleasure
and
obedience
one
to
the
other
if
they
love
one
another
the
greater
part
of
the
ménagier
book
is
concerned
however
not
with
the
theoretical
niceties
of
wifely
submission
but
with
his
creature
comforts
his
instructions
as
to
how
to
make
a
husband
comfortable
positively
palpitate
with
life
and
at
the
same
time
there
is
something
indescribably
homely
and
touching
about
them
they
tell
more
about
the
real
life
of
a
burgess
wife
than
a
hundred
tales
of
patient
griselda
or
of
jehanne
la
quentine
consider
this
picture
how
typical
a
product
of
the
masculine
imagination
of
the
stout
buffeted
about
in
all
weathers
and
amid
all
discomforts
nobly
pursuing
the
task
of
earning
his
living
and
fortified
by
the
recollection
of
a
domesticated
little
wife
darning
his
stockings
at
home
by
the
fire
and
prepared
to
lavish
her
attentions
on
the
weary
hero
in
the
evening
the
passage
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
ménagier
vivid
and
simple
style
and
of
the
use
of
incidents
drawn
from
everyday
life
to
illustrate
his
thesis
which
is
one
of
the
chief
charms
of
the
book
fair
sister
if
you
have
another
husband
after
me
know
that
you
should
think
much
of
his
comfort
for
after
a
woman
has
lost
her
first
husband
she
commonly
finds
it
difficult
to
find
another
according
to
her
estate
and
she
remains
lonely
and
disconsolate
for
a
long
time
f
and
more
so
still
if
she
lose
the
second
wherefore
cherish
the
person
of
your
husband
carefully
and
i
pray
you
keep
him
in
clean
linen
for
is
your
business
and
because
the
care
of
outside
affairs
lieth
with
men
so
must
a
husband
take
heed
and
go
and
come
and
journey
hither
and
thither
in
rain
and
wind
in
snow
and
hail
now
drenched
now
dry
now
sweating
now
shivering
and
and
nothing
harms
him
because
he
is
upheld
by
the
hope
that
he
has
of
his
wife
care
of
him
on
his
return
and
of
the
ease
the
joys
and
the
pleasures
which
she
will
do
to
him
or
cause
to
be
done
to
him
in
her
presence
to
have
his
shoes
removed
before
a
good
fire
his
feet
washed
and
to
have
fresh
shoes
and
stockings
to
be
given
good
food
and
drink
to
be
well
served
and
well
looked
after
well
bedded
in
white
sheets
and
well
covered
with
good
furs
and
assuaged
with
other
joys
and
amusements
privities
loves
and
secrets
concerning
which
i
am
silent
and
on
the
next
day
fresh
shirts
and
garments
certes
fair
sister
such
service
maketh
a
man
love
and
desire
to
return
to
his
home
and
to
see
his
goodwife
and
to
be
distant
with
other
women
footnote
f
this
seems
to
be
contrary
to
experience
and
therefore
i
counsel
you
to
make
such
cheer
to
your
husband
at
all
his
comings
and
goings
and
to
persevere
therein
and
also
to
be
peaceable
with
him
and
remember
the
rustic
proverb
which
saith
that
there
be
three
things
which
drive
the
goodman
from
home
to
wit
a
dripping
roof
a
smoking
chimney
and
a
scolding
woman
wherefore
fair
sister
i
pray
you
that
in
order
to
keep
yourself
in
love
and
good
favour
with
your
husband
you
be
unto
him
gentle
amiable
and
debonair
do
unto
him
what
the
good
simple
women
of
our
country
say
has
been
done
unto
their
sons
when
the
lads
have
set
their
love
elsewhere
and
their
mothers
can
not
wean
them
from
it
it
is
certain
that
when
fathers
and
mothers
be
dead
and
stepfathers
and
stepmothers
argue
with
their
stepsons
and
scold
them
and
repulse
them
and
take
not
thought
for
their
sleeping
nor
for
their
food
and
drink
their
hose
and
their
shirts
and
all
their
other
needs
and
affairs
and
the
same
children
find
elsewhere
a
good
home
and
good
counsel
from
some
other
woman
who
receives
them
and
takes
thought
to
warm
them
with
some
poor
gruel
with
her
and
to
give
them
a
bed
and
keep
them
tidy
mending
their
hosen
breeches
shirts
and
other
garments
then
those
lads
cleave
to
her
and
desire
to
be
with
her
and
to
sleep
warm
between
her
breasts
and
are
altogether
estranged
from
their
mothers
and
fathers
who
before
took
no
heed
of
them
and
now
want
to
get
them
back
and
have
them
again
but
it
may
not
be
for
these
children
hold
more
dear
the
company
of
strangers
who
think
and
care
for
them
than
that
of
their
kinsfolk
who
have
no
care
of
them
then
the
parents
lament
and
weep
and
say
that
these
same
women
have
bewitched
their
children
and
that
they
are
spellbound
and
can
not
leave
but
are
never
easy
save
when
they
are
with
their
enchantresses
but
whatever
may
be
said
of
it
it
is
no
witchcraft
but
it
by
reason
of
the
love
the
care
the
intimacies
joys
and
pleasures
which
these
women
do
in
all
ways
unto
the
lads
and
on
my
soul
there
is
no
other
enchantment
wherefore
dear
sister
i
pray
you
thus
to
bewitch
and
bewitch
again
your
husband
and
beware
of
dripping
roof
and
smoking
fire
and
scold
him
not
but
be
unto
him
gentle
and
amiable
and
peaceable
be
careful
that
in
winter
he
has
good
fire
without
smoke
and
let
him
rest
well
and
be
well
covered
between
your
breasts
and
thus
bewitch
him
and
thus
you
shall
preserve
and
guard
him
from
all
discomforts
and
give
him
all
the
ease
that
you
can
and
serve
him
and
cause
him
to
be
well
served
in
your
house
and
you
shall
look
to
him
for
outside
things
for
if
he
be
a
good
man
he
will
take
even
more
care
and
trouble
over
them
than
you
wish
and
by
doing
as
i
have
said
you
will
make
him
always
miss
you
and
have
his
heart
with
you
and
with
your
loving
service
and
he
will
shun
all
other
houses
all
other
women
all
other
services
and
households
all
will
be
naught
to
him
save
you
alone
if
you
think
of
him
as
aforesaid
and
so
on
the
road
husbands
will
think
of
their
wives
and
no
trouble
will
be
a
burden
to
them
for
the
hope
and
love
they
will
have
of
their
wives
whom
they
will
long
to
see
even
as
poor
hermits
penitents
and
fasting
monks
long
to
see
the
face
of
christ
jesus
and
husbands
served
thus
will
never
desire
to
abide
elsewhere
or
in
other
company
but
will
withhold
withdraw
and
abstain
themselves
all
the
rest
will
seem
to
them
but
a
bed
of
stones
compared
with
their
home
enough
has
perhaps
been
quoted
to
show
the
ménagier
idea
of
a
perfect
wife
his
idea
of
the
perfect
housewife
is
contained
in
a
mass
of
instructions
which
make
excellently
entertaining
reading
so
modern
in
tone
is
his
section
on
the
management
of
servants
both
in
his
account
of
their
ways
and
in
his
advice
upon
dealing
with
them
that
one
often
rubs
one
eyes
to
be
sure
that
what
one
is
reading
is
really
a
book
written
over
five
centuries
ago
by
an
old
burgess
of
paris
the
ménagier
evidently
had
a
fairly
large
household
and
he
probably
owned
a
country
as
well
as
a
town
house
for
he
speaks
several
times
of
overseeing
the
you
are
in
the
village
to
assist
his
wife
in
superintending
this
large
staff
he
has
a
called
master
john
the
steward
and
a
duenna
half
housekeeper
and
half
chaperon
for
her
young
mistress
called
dame
agnes
g
and
a
bailiff
or
foreman
to
look
after
the
farm
the
ménagier
divides
his
servants
and
workmen
into
three
classes
first
those
engaged
by
the
day
or
by
the
season
for
special
work
such
as
porters
and
carriers
reapers
winnowers
coopers
and
so
on
secondly
those
engaged
on
piecework
such
as
tailors
furriers
bakers
and
shoemakers
hired
by
medieval
households
of
some
wealth
to
make
what
was
needed
from
raw
material
purchased
at
fairs
or
in
the
shops
of
the
city
and
thirdly
the
ordinary
domestic
servants
who
were
hired
by
the
year
and
lived
in
their
master
house
of
all
these
he
says
is
none
who
does
not
gladly
seek
work
and
a
master
footnote
g
the
béguines
were
a
sort
of
religious
order
or
more
correctly
a
lay
sisterhood
standing
between
the
lay
and
the
monastic
life
and
somewhat
analogous
to
the
franciscan
tertiaries
or
third
order
he
gives
an
amusing
account
evidently
based
upon
bitter
experience
of
the
wiles
of
the
hired
workman
he
says
that
they
are
commonly
lazy
rough
quick
at
back
arrogant
except
on
payday
and
ready
to
break
into
insults
if
unsatisfied
with
their
pay
he
warns
his
wife
to
bid
master
john
always
to
take
the
peaceable
ones
and
always
to
bargain
with
them
beforehand
as
to
the
pay
for
which
they
will
do
the
work
for
know
that
most
often
they
do
not
want
to
bargain
but
they
want
to
get
to
work
without
any
bargain
having
been
made
and
they
say
gently
it
is
nothing
there
is
no
need
you
will
pay
me
well
and
i
shall
be
content
with
what
you
think
fit
and
if
master
john
take
them
thus
when
the
work
is
finished
they
will
say
there
was
more
to
do
than
i
thought
there
was
this
and
that
to
do
and
here
and
there
and
they
will
not
take
what
is
given
them
and
will
break
out
into
shouting
and
angry
words
and
will
spread
abroad
evil
report
concerning
you
which
is
worst
of
all
we
know
from
the
various
ordinances
fixing
wages
from
the
time
of
the
black
death
onwards
that
labour
troubles
were
acute
in
france
as
well
as
in
england
at
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
the
advice
throws
an
interesting
sidelight
on
the
situation
it
is
however
in
his
observations
upon
the
engagement
and
management
of
maidservants
that
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
is
most
apparent
incidentally
he
gives
an
account
of
how
servants
were
hired
in
paris
which
shows
that
the
registry
office
and
the
character
are
by
no
means
modern
phenomena
there
were
women
holding
what
we
should
call
registry
offices
in
paris
at
this
time
and
an
ordinance
of
fixing
wages
after
the
black
death
allows
them
to
take
for
placing
a
chambermaid
and
for
a
nurse
a
servant
maid
wage
at
this
time
was
a
year
and
her
shoes
the
ménagier
counsels
his
wife
thus
on
the
delicate
subject
of
interviewing
and
engaging
her
domestic
chambermaids
and
serving
men
know
dear
sister
he
says
that
in
order
that
they
may
obey
you
better
and
fear
the
more
to
anger
you
i
leave
you
the
rule
and
authority
to
have
them
chosen
by
dame
agnes
the
béguine
or
by
whichever
other
of
your
women
you
please
to
receive
them
into
our
service
to
hire
them
at
your
pleasure
to
pay
and
keep
them
in
our
service
as
you
please
and
to
dismiss
them
when
you
will
nathless
you
should
privily
speak
to
me
about
it
and
act
according
to
my
advice
because
you
are
too
young
and
might
be
deceived
by
your
own
people
and
know
that
of
those
chambermaids
who
are
out
of
a
place
many
there
be
who
offer
themselves
and
clamour
and
seek
urgently
for
masters
and
mistresses
and
of
these
take
none
until
you
first
know
where
their
last
place
was
and
send
some
of
your
people
to
get
their
character
to
wit
whether
they
talked
or
drank
too
much
how
long
they
were
in
the
place
what
work
they
have
been
accustomed
to
doing
and
can
do
whether
they
have
homes
or
friends
in
the
town
from
what
sort
of
people
and
what
part
of
the
country
they
come
how
long
they
were
there
and
why
they
left
and
by
their
work
in
the
past
you
shall
find
out
what
hope
or
expectation
you
may
have
of
their
work
in
the
future
and
know
that
such
women
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
have
been
blamed
for
some
fault
in
their
own
part
of
the
world
and
that
is
what
brings
them
into
service
at
a
distance
and
if
you
find
from
the
report
of
her
master
and
mistress
neighbours
and
others
that
a
girl
is
what
you
need
find
out
from
her
and
cause
master
john
to
register
in
his
account
book
the
day
on
which
you
engage
her
her
name
and
those
of
her
father
mother
and
any
of
her
kinsfolk
the
place
where
they
live
and
her
birthplace
and
her
references
for
servants
will
be
more
afraid
to
do
wrong
if
they
know
that
you
are
recording
all
these
things
and
that
if
they
leave
you
without
permission
or
are
guilty
of
any
offence
you
will
write
and
complain
to
the
justice
of
their
country
or
to
their
friends
and
not
withstanding
bear
in
mind
the
saying
of
the
philosopher
called
bertrand
the
old
who
says
that
if
you
engage
a
maid
or
man
of
high
and
proud
answers
you
shall
know
that
when
she
leaves
she
will
miscall
you
if
she
can
and
if
on
the
contrary
she
be
flattering
and
of
blandishments
trust
her
not
for
she
is
in
league
with
someone
else
to
trick
you
but
if
she
blushes
and
is
silent
and
shamefast
when
you
correct
her
love
her
as
your
daughter
the
ménagier
instructions
as
to
how
to
look
after
servants
when
they
have
been
engaged
are
equally
practical
good
order
is
to
be
maintained
quarrels
and
bad
language
prevented
and
morals
guarded
each
is
to
have
his
or
her
work
assigned
and
to
do
it
promptly
you
order
them
to
do
something
now
and
these
your
servants
answer
there
is
plenty
of
time
it
shall
be
done
or
it
shall
be
done
tomorrow
hold
it
as
forgotten
it
must
all
be
begun
again
it
is
as
nought
and
also
when
you
give
a
general
order
to
every
one
each
will
wait
for
the
other
to
do
it
and
it
is
the
same
not
only
is
the
work
of
the
servants
to
be
carefully
superintended
by
the
mistress
and
by
dame
agnes
is
with
you
the
ménagier
tells
his
wife
order
to
teach
you
wise
and
ripe
behaviour
and
to
serve
and
instruct
you
and
to
whom
in
particular
i
give
the
charge
of
this
matter
but
she
is
to
show
herself
careful
and
benevolent
in
looking
after
their
health
and
happiness
at
the
proper
hour
she
is
to
cause
them
to
sit
down
before
a
hearty
meal
of
one
sort
of
meat
avoiding
rich
viands
and
one
kind
of
drink
which
must
be
nourishing
but
not
intoxicating
cup
that
cheers
but
not
inebriates
probably
in
this
case
the
light
ale
which
was
the
habitual
drink
of
the
middle
ages
she
is
to
admonish
them
to
eat
and
drink
their
fill
but
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
tell
stories
or
to
argue
or
to
lean
on
their
elbows
order
the
béguine
to
make
them
rise
and
take
away
their
table
for
the
common
folk
have
a
saying
a
varlet
holds
forth
at
table
and
a
horse
grazes
in
the
ditch
it
is
time
to
take
them
away
for
they
have
had
their
fill
in
the
evening
after
their
afternoon
work
they
are
to
have
another
hearty
meal
and
then
in
winter
time
they
may
warm
themselves
at
the
fire
and
take
their
ease
then
she
is
to
lock
up
the
house
and
pack
them
all
off
to
bed
and
arrange
first
that
each
have
beside
his
bed
a
candlestick
in
which
to
put
his
candle
and
have
them
wisely
taught
to
extinguish
it
with
the
mouth
or
hand
before
getting
into
bed
and
by
no
means
with
their
shirts
and
also
have
them
admonished
and
taught
each
and
all
that
they
must
begin
again
the
next
day
and
that
they
must
rise
in
the
morning
and
each
set
to
upon
his
own
work
the
ménagier
further
advises
his
wife
that
chambermaids
of
fifteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
are
foolish
girls
who
do
not
know
the
world
and
that
she
should
always
cause
them
to
sleep
near
her
in
an
antechamber
or
a
room
without
a
skylight
or
a
low
window
looking
on
to
the
street
and
should
make
them
get
up
and
go
to
bed
at
the
same
time
as
herself
you
yourself
he
adds
if
god
please
will
be
wise
by
this
time
must
keep
them
near
to
you
moreover
if
any
of
her
servants
fall
ill
you
yourself
laying
aside
all
other
cares
very
lovingly
and
charitably
care
for
him
or
her
and
visit
him
and
study
diligently
how
to
bring
about
his
cure
but
it
is
perhaps
in
his
capacity
as
mrs
beeton
that
the
ménagier
is
most
amusing
his
infinite
variety
of
household
knowledge
is
shown
in
the
incidental
recipes
which
he
gives
when
he
is
describing
the
measures
which
a
wife
must
take
for
her
lord
comfort
and
the
work
of
the
servants
there
are
elaborate
instructions
concerning
the
costly
medieval
garments
worn
year
after
year
for
a
lifetime
and
often
bequeathed
in
their
owner
will
instructions
for
cleaning
dresses
and
furs
and
for
preserving
them
from
moths
and
instructions
for
removing
stains
and
grease
spots
the
ménagier
gives
seven
recipes
for
taking
out
grease
spots
but
he
is
rather
sceptical
about
one
or
two
of
them
which
he
has
evidently
copied
from
a
book
without
trying
them
for
himself
get
rid
of
stains
on
a
dress
of
silk
satin
camlet
damask
cloth
or
another
runs
one
of
these
and
wash
the
stain
in
verjuice
and
the
stain
will
go
even
if
the
dress
be
faded
it
will
regain
its
colour
i
do
not
the
chief
impression
left
however
is
that
the
medieval
housewife
was
engaged
in
a
constant
warfare
against
fleas
one
of
the
ménagier
infallible
rules
for
keeping
a
husband
happy
at
home
is
to
give
him
a
good
fire
in
the
winter
and
keep
his
bed
free
from
fleas
in
the
summer
he
gives
six
recipes
for
getting
rid
of
such
small
livestock
which
must
indeed
have
been
a
very
common
trial
to
our
forefathers
in
summer
take
heed
that
there
be
no
fleas
in
your
chamber
nor
in
your
bed
which
you
may
do
in
six
ways
as
i
have
heard
tell
for
i
have
heard
from
several
persons
that
if
the
room
be
scattered
with
alder
leaves
the
fleas
will
get
caught
therein
item
i
have
heard
tell
that
if
you
have
at
night
one
or
two
trenchers
of
bread
covered
with
birdlime
or
turpentine
and
put
about
the
room
with
a
lighted
candle
set
in
the
midst
of
each
trencher
they
will
come
and
get
stuck
thereto
another
way
which
i
have
found
and
which
is
true
take
a
rough
cloth
and
spread
it
about
your
room
and
over
your
bed
and
all
the
fleas
who
may
hop
on
to
it
will
be
caught
so
that
you
can
carry
them
out
with
the
cloth
wheresoever
you
will
item
sheepskins
item
i
have
seen
blankets
placed
on
the
straw
and
on
the
bed
and
when
the
black
fleas
jumped
upon
them
they
were
the
sooner
found
and
killed
upon
the
white
but
the
best
way
is
to
guard
oneself
against
those
which
are
within
the
coverlets
and
furs
and
the
stuff
of
the
dresses
wherewith
one
is
covered
for
know
that
i
have
tried
this
and
when
the
coverlets
furs
or
dresses
in
which
there
be
fleas
are
folded
and
shut
tightly
up
in
a
chest
straitly
bound
with
straps
or
in
a
bag
well
tied
up
and
pressed
or
otherwise
compressed
so
that
the
said
fleas
are
without
light
and
air
and
kept
imprisoned
then
they
will
perish
and
die
at
once
a
similar
war
had
also
to
be
waged
against
flies
and
mosquitoes
which
rendered
summer
miserable
i
have
sometimes
says
the
ménagier
seen
in
several
chambers
that
when
one
has
gone
to
bed
in
them
they
were
full
of
mosquitoes
which
at
the
smoke
of
the
breath
came
to
sit
on
the
faces
of
those
who
slept
and
sting
them
so
that
they
were
fain
to
get
up
and
light
a
fire
of
hay
to
smoke
them
off
against
such
pests
he
has
also
six
infallible
recipes
to
wit
a
mosquito
net
over
the
bed
sprigs
of
fern
hung
up
for
the
flies
to
settle
on
a
bowl
filled
with
a
mixture
of
milk
and
hare
gall
or
with
the
juice
of
raw
onions
which
will
kill
them
a
bottle
containing
a
rag
dipped
in
honey
or
else
a
string
dipped
in
honey
to
hang
up
fly
whisks
to
drive
them
away
and
closing
up
windows
with
oiled
cloth
or
parchment
the
section
on
cookery
which
contains
the
ménagier
injunctions
for
feeding
the
brute
is
the
longest
in
the
book
and
gives
an
extraordinarily
interesting
picture
of
the
domestic
economy
of
our
ancestors
the
ménagier
must
have
been

franklin

of

and
for

some
of

delicious
others
would
be

degenerate
digestions
today
pungent
sauces
of
vinegar
verjuice
and
wine
were
very
much
favoured
and
cloves
cinnamon
galingale
pepper
and
ginger
appear
unexpectedly
in
meat
dishes
almonds
were
a
favourite
ingredient
in
all
sorts
of
dishes
as
they
still
are
in
china
and
other
parts
of
the
east
and
they
might
well
be
used
more
lavishly
than
they
are
in
modern
european
cookery
true
to
his
race
the
ménagier
includes
recipes
for
cooking
frogs
and
snails
to
the
modern
cook
some
of
his
directions
may
appear
somewhat
vague
as
when
he
bids
his
cook
to
boil
something
for
as
long
as
it
takes
to
say
a
paternoster
or
a
yet
for
clockless
kitchens
in
a
pious
age
what
clearer
indication
could
a
man
give
and
after
all
it
is
no
worse
than
in
a
hot
oven
which
still
finds
a
place
in
many
modern
cookery
books
which
should
know
better
other
instructions
are
detailed
enough
in
one
valuable
passage
he
gives
a
list
of
all
the
meat
markets
of
paris
together
with
the
number
of
butchers
to
be
found
in
each
and
the
number
of
sheep
oxen
pigs
and
calves
sold
there
every
week
adding
also
for
interest
the
amount
of
meat
and
poultry
consumed
weekly
in
the
households
of
the
king
the
queen
and
the
royal
children
the
dukes
of
orleans
berry
burgundy
and
bourbon
elsewhere
also
he
speaks
of
other
markets
the
or
milk
market
the
place
de
grève
where
they
sell
coal
and
firewood
and
the
which
is
not
only
a
meat
market
but
the
best
place
in
which
to
buy
fish
and
salt
and
green
herbs
and
branches
to
adorn
your
rooms
for
his
wife
further
guidance
the
ménagier
sets
out
a
careful
specification
of
the
catering
arrangements
for
several
great
feasts
to
wit
a
dinner
given
by
the
abbot
of
lagny
to
the
bishop
of
paris
and
the
members
of
the
king
council
the
feast
comprising
dinner
and
supper
which
one
master
elias
evidently
a
grave
and
reverend
like
master
john
himself
made
for
the
wedding
of
jean
du
chesne
upon
a
tuesday
in
may
and
the
arrangements
for
another
wedding
les
nopces
hautecourt
in
the
month
of
september
as
to
which
the
ménagier
observes
that
because
they
were
widower
and
widow
they
were
wed
very
early
in
their
black
robes
and
then
put
on
others
he
was
anxious
that
his
widow
should
do
the
correct
thing
at
that
second
wedding
of
hers
the
description
of
the
wedding
feast
arranged
by
master
elias
is
particularly
detailed
and
valuable
the
careful
ménagier
perhaps
because
he
foresaw
some
big
entertainment
which
he
must
give
to
the
burgesses
and
gentlemen
of
paris
perhaps
because
of
his
delightful
interest
in
all
the
details
of
material
life
has
set
down
at
length
not
only
the
menu
of
the
dinner
and
supper
but
a
long
account
of
the
ingredients
needed
their
quantities
and
prices
and
the
shops
or
markets
where
they
must
be
bought
so
that
the
reader
can
see
with
his
eyes
the
and
the
cooks
going
round
from
stall
to
stall
visiting
butcher
and
baker
poulterer
saucemaker
vintner
wafer
maker
who
sold
the
wafers
and
pastries
dear
to
medieval
ladies
and
spicer
whose
shop
was
heavy
with
the
scents
of
the
east
the
ménagier
sets
down
also
all
the
esquires
and
varlets
and
waiters
who
will
be
needed
to
serve
such
a
feast
as
this
there
was
the

a
pregnant
addition
then
there
were
ushers
and
strong
to
keep
the
doors
and
a
clerk
to
add
up
the
account
and
two
squires
to
serve
at
the
dresser
in
the
kitchen
where
the
plates
and
dishes
were
handed
out
two
others
at
the
hall
dresser
to
give
out
spoons
and
drinking
cups
and
pour
wine
for
the
guests
and
two
others
in
the
pantry
to
give
out
the
wine
which
their
varlet
kept
drawing
for
them
there
were
the
two
to
set
out

the
four
great
gilded

the
four

the

the

and
to
usher
the
guests
to
their
places
a
head
waiter
and
two
servitors
for
each
table
a
flower
girl
to
make
chaplets
of
flowers
for
the
guests
women
to
see
to
the
linen
and
deck
the
bridal
bed
and
a
washerwoman
the
floors
were
strewn
with
violets
and
green
herbs
and
the
rooms
decked
with
branches
of
may
all
bought
in
the
market
in
early
morning
and
there
was
a
good
stock
of
torches
and
candles
small
candles
to
stand
on
the
supper
tables
and
great
torches
to
be
set
in
sconces
on
the
walls
or
to
be
carried
in
procession
by
the
guests
for
the
supper
ended
with
singing
wine
and
spices
and
lighted
torches
on
this
occasion
eight
francs
were
given
to
the
minstrels
over
and
above
the
spoons
and
other
presents
made
to
them
during
the
meal
and
there
were
also
acrobats
and
mimes
to
amuse
the
guests
if
they
had
to
prepare
a
great
feast
master
john
and
his
little
mistress
could
not
go
far
wrong
after
this
or
fail
to
please
the
genial
epicure
who
set
it
down
for
them
the
ménagier
copied
many
of
his
recipes
from
other
cookery
books
but
he
must
have
got
the
details
of
this
entertainment
from
master
elias
himself
and
one
can
see
their
grey
heads
wagging
with
enjoyment
as
one
talked
and
the
other
wrote
the
cookery
book
ends
with
a
section
containing
recipes
for
making
what
the
ménagier
calls
things
which
are
not
necessities
there
are
various
sorts
of
jams
mostly
made
with
honey
in
the
middle
ages
vegetables
were
evidently
much
prepared
in
this
way
for
the
ménagier
speaks
of
turnip
carrot
and
pumpkin
jam
there
is
a
delicious
syrup
of
mixed
spices
at
least
the
palate
of
faith
must
believe
it
to
have
been
delicious
and
a
powder
of
ginger
cinnamon
cloves
cardamom
and
sugar
to
be
sifted
over
food
as
sugar
is
sifted
today
there
is
a
recipe
for
hippocras
and
for
or
wafers
and
for
candied
oranges
there
are
various
sage
pieces
of
advice
as
to
the
seasons
for
certain
foods
and
the
best
ways
of
cooking
and
serving
them
most
amusing
of
all
these
are
a
number
of
recipes
not
of
a
culinary
nature
to
wit
for
making
glue
and
marking
ink
for
bringing
up
small
birds
in
aviaries
and
cages
preparing
sand
for
making
drying
roses
to
lay
among
dresses
as
we
lay
lavender
today
for
curing
and
for
curing
the
bite
of
a
mad
dog
the
latter
is
a
charm
of
the
same
type
as
the
ménagier

charms
a

she

nowadays

only
perchance
and
says
her

very
neatly

fetching
of
bowls
of

to
wash
his

to

him
such

while

she
nibbles
her
sweet

afterwards
an
hour
of

when
she
tells
him
how
she
has
passed
the
day
and
asks
him
what
she
shall
do
with
the
silly
young
housemaid
whom
she
caught
talking
to

through

low
window

round

puckered
with

over

there
is
warm
affection

pride
too
in
the
look
the
old
man
turns
down
upon
her
so
the
night
falls
and
they

ecclesiastical
jeremiahs
were
often
wont
to
use
the
characteristically
medieval
argument
that
if
god
had
meant
woman
for
a
position
of
superiority
he
would
have
taken
her
from
adam
head
rather
than
his
side
but
the
ménagier
would
have
agreed
with
the
more
logical
peter
lombard
who
observed
that
she
was
not
taken
from
adam
head
because
she
was
not
intended
to
be
his
ruler
nor
from
his
feet
either
because
she
was
not
intended
to
be
his
slave
but
from
his
side
precisely
because
she
was
intended
to
be
his
companion
there
is
something
of
this
spirit
in
the
ménagier
attitude
towards
his
little
wife
and
it
is
this
which
makes
his
book
so
charming
and
causes
it
to
stand
head
and
shoulders
above
most
other
medieval
books
of
behaviour
for
women
but
above
all
its
social
and
historical
value
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
gives
us
in
hues
undimmed
by
time
a
full
length
portrait
of
a
medieval
housewife
who
has
her
place

in

wool
was
the
foundation
of
england
greatness
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
industrial
revolution
when
cotton
and
iron
took
its
place
so
if
you
look
at
old
pictures
of
the
house
of
lords
in
henry
viii
reign
or
in
elizabeth
you
will
see
the
woolsack
before
the
throne
as
you
will
see
it
if
you
visit
the
house
today
the
lord
chancellor
of
england
is
seated
upon
a
woolsack
because
it
was
upon
a
woolsack
that
this
fair
land
rose
to
prosperity
the
most
remarkable
body
of
traders
in
england
during
the
middle
ages
were
the
merchants
of
the
staple
who
traded
in
wool
the
wool
trade
had
for
long
been
the
largest
and
most
lucrative
body
of
trade
in
the
country
and
it
was
one
in
which
the
kings
of
england
were
particularly
interested
for
their
customs
revenue
was
drawn
largely
from
wool
and
wool
fells
and
moreover
when
they
desired
to
borrow
money
in
anticipation
of
revenue
it
was
to
the
wool
merchants
that
they
turned
because
the
wool
merchants
were
the
wealthiest
traders
in
the
country
for
these
and
other
reasons
the
government
adopted
the
custom
of
fixing
staple
towns
which
acted
as
centres
of
distribution
through
which
the
export
trade
was
forced
to
go
the
location
of
the
staple
was
altered
from
time
to
time
sometimes
it
was
at
bruges
sometimes
at
antwerp
sometimes
in
england
but
usually
it
was
at
calais
where
it
was
first
fixed
in
and
finally
established
in
through
the
staple
all
wool
and
wool
fells
hides
leather
and
tin
had
to
pass
and
the
organization
of
the
system
was
complete
when
the
body
of
wool
merchants
in
whose
hands
lay
the
bulk
of
the
staple
trade
were
finally
incorporated
in
under
the
governance
of
a
mayor
the
system
was
a
convenient
one
for
crown
and
merchants
alike
the
crown
could
concentrate
its
customs
officers
in
one
place
and
collect
its
customs
the
more
easily
particularly
as
a
method
was
gradually
developed
by
which
the
custom
and
subsidy
on
wool
was
paid
to
the
royal
officials
by
the
fellowship
of
the
staple
who
then
collected
it
from
the
individual
members
the
merchants
on
the
other
hand
benefited
by
the
concentration
in
trade
they
were
able
to
travel
in
groups
and
to
organize
convoys
to
protect
the
wool
fleets
from
pirates
who
swarmed
in
the
narrow
seas
between
england
and
france
as
members
of
a
powerful
corporation
they
could
secure
both
privileges
and
protection
in
flanders
moreover
the
wool
buyers
also
benefited
by
the
arrangement
which
rendered
possible
a
careful
surveillance
by
the
crown
and
the
company
of
the
staple
of
the
quality
of
the
wool
offered
for
sale
and
a
series
of
regulations
against
fraud
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
days
when
trade
stood
in
need
of
a
protection
which
the
government
was
not
yet
able
to
give
it
there
was
nothing
unpopular
in
the
idea
of
giving
the
monopoly
of
the
staple
trade
to
the
members
of
a
single
company
in
companies
is
natural
to
englishmen
wrote
bacon
and
for
four
centuries
it
was
the
great
trading
companies
which
nurtured
english
trade
and
made
this
country
the
commercial
leader
of
the
world
the
wool
trade
throve
in
england
until
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
but
throughout
the
fifteenth
century
the
staplers
were
beginning
to
feel
the
competition
of
another
company
that
of
the
famous
merchant
adventurers
who
taking
advantage
of
the
growth
in
the
native
cloth
manufacture
during
the
previous
century
had
begun
to
do
a
great
trade
in
the
export
of
cloth
this
was
obnoxious
to
the
staplers
who
desired
the
continuance
of
the
old
system
by
which
they
exported
english
wool
to
the
continent
where
at
ypres
and
ghent
bruges
and
mechlin
and
the
other
famous
cities
of
the
netherlands
it
was
woven
into
fine
cloth
this
cloth
manufacture
gave
to
the
netherlands
a
sort
of
industrial
in
europe
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
it
was
dependent
entirely
upon
a
good
supply
of
english
wool
for
the
next
best
wool
in
europe
that
of
spain
was
not
satisfactory
unless
mixed
with
wool
of
english
growth
hence
the
close
political
tie
between
england
and
flanders
the
one
needing
a
customer
the
other
an
essential

the
coat
on
the
englishman
back
was
made
out
of
english
wool
indeed
but
it
had
been
manufactured
in
flanders
and
the
staplers
saw
no
reason
why
it
should
ever
be
otherwise
as
to
the
flemings
the
political
alliances
which
commercial
necessities
constantly
entailed
between
the
two
countries
gave
rise
among
them
to
a
proverb
that
they
bought
the
from
the
english
for
a
groat
and
sold
them

they
were

the
great
cities
of

were
finally
ruined
by
the
growth
of
the
english
cloth
manufacture
which
absorbed
the
english
wool
however
in
spite
of
the
growing
prosperity
of
this
trade
which
had
by
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
ousted
that
of
wool
as
the
chief
english
export
trade
the
company
of
the
merchants
of
the
staple
was
still
great
and
famous
throughout
the
fifteenth
century
many
were
the
wealthy
and
respected
staplers
who
were
in
those
days
to
be
found
directing
the
destinies
of
english
towns
mayors
of
london
and
provincial
ports
contractors
and
moneylenders

impecunious

so

the
daily
life
of
a
merchant
of
the
staple
is
not
a
difficult
one
to
reconstruct
partly
because
the
golden
fleece
has
left
so
many
marks
upon
our
national
life
partly
because
the
statute
book
is
full
of
regulations
concerning
the
wool
trade
but
chiefly
because
there
have
come
down
to
us
many
private
letters
from
persons
engaged
in
shipping
wool
from
england
to
calais
of
all
the
different
sorts
of
raw
material
out
of
which
the
history
of
ordinary
people
in
the
middle
ages
has
to
be
made
their
letters
are
perhaps
the
most
enthralling
because
in
their
letters
people
live
and
explain
themselves
in
all
their
individuality
in
the
fifteenth
century
most
men
and
women
of
the
upper
and
middle
classes
could
read
and
write
although
their
spelling
was
sometimes
marvellous
to
behold
and
st
olave
church
is
apt
to
become
tolowys
scryssche
beneath
their
painfully
labouring
goose
quills
and
punctuation
is
almost
entirely
to
seek
but
what
matter
their
meaning
is
clear
enough
good
fortune
has
preserved
in
various
english
archives
several
great
collections
of
family
letters
written
in
the
fifteenth
century
finest
of
all
are
the
famous
paston
letters
written
by
and
to
a
family
of
norfolk
gentlefolk
and
crammed
with
information
about
high
politics
and
daily
life
less
interesting
but
valuable
all
the
same
are
the
letters
of
the
plumptons
who
were
lords
in
yorkshire
but
for
our
purposes
the
most
interesting
are
two
other
collections
to
wit
the
correspondence
of
the
stonors
whose
estates
lay
chiefly
in
oxfordshire
and
the
neighbouring
counties
and
the
cely
papers
kept
by
a
family
of
merchants
of
the
staple
these
two
collections
give
us
a
vivid
picture
of
wool
staplers
in
their
public
and
private
lives
the
cely
papers
cover
the
years
to
and
it
so
happens
that
during
that
period
william
stonor
he
became
sir
william
in
also
became
interested
in
the
wool
trade
for
in
he
married
elizabeth
riche
the
daughter
and
widow
of
wealthy
city
merchants
the
stonors
had
great
sheep
runs
on
their
estates
in
the
chilterns
and
cotswolds
and
william
readily
perceived
the
advantage
of
his
alliance
with
elizabeth
family
who
were
interested
in
the
wool
trade
consequently
he
entered
into
a
partnership
with
a
friend
of
his
wife
a
merchant
of
the
staple
in
calais
named
thomas
betson
who
is
the
subject
of
this
study
and
until
elizabeth
death
in
he
took
an
active
part
in
the
export
trade
thomas
betson
died
in
and
was
thus
an
exact
contemporary
of
those
other
merchants
of
the
staple
george
and
richard
cely
whom
he
must
have
known
indeed
william
cely
their
cousin
and
agent
writes
from
london
to
george
in
calais
in
advising
him
that
he
has
dispatched
fells

which
contain
many
letters
from
and
concerning
him
during
the
years
of
his
partnership
with
sir
william
and
of
the
papers
which
are
full
of
information
about
the
life
of
a
merchant
of
the
staple
at
calais
thomas
betson
may
be
summoned
before
us
by
a
kindly
magic
until
he
almost
lives
again
so
he
deserves
to
do
for
he
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
people
revealed
to
us
in
any
of
the
letters
for
honest
charm
he
has
no
rival
save
the
attractive
margery
brews
who
married
john
paston
the
younger
and
shows
up
so
pleasantly
beside
the
hard
paston
women
perhaps
the
reason
why
our
hearts
warm
immediately
towards
thomas
betson
is
that
our
first
meeting
with
him
plunges
us
immediately
into
a
love
affair
his
first
letter
to
william

is
dated
april
and

pickled
modern
opinion
which
is
happily
in

of

of
adult
marriages
is
often
shocked
by
the
air
of
business
which
pervades
matchmaking
in

days

by
the
many
cases
of

in
those
days
it
was
held
that

fourteen

a

at
twelve
a
discrepancy
which
the
great
canon

attributed
to
the
fact

repudiate
the
contract

so

to
separate
modern
england
from
the

so
plainly
as
the
case

for

to

of

john

through

service
the

declared
that

that
after
her

to

when
he

he
never

with
his

he
beynge
at
that
tyme
at
her
brother
house
sometimes
however
medieval
records
throw
a
pleasanter
light
on
these
child
marriages
such
was
the
light
thrown
by
the
ménagier
de
book
for
his
young
wife
so
kindly
so
affectionate
so
full
of
indulgence
for
her
youth
and
such
also
is
the
light
thrown
by
the
charming
letter
which
thomas
betson
wrote
to
little
katherine
riche
on
the
first
day
of
june
in
it
is
a
veritable
gem
and
it
is
strange
that
it
has
not
attracted
more
notice
for
certainly
no
anthology
of
english
letters
should
be
without
it
i
set
it
down
here
at
length
for
it
brings
to
warm
life
again
both
thomas
betson
and
katherine
riche
mine
own
heartily
beloved
cousin
katherine
i
recommend
me
unto
you
with
all
the
inwardness
of
my
heart
and
now
lately
ye
shall
understand
that
i
received
a
token
from
you
the
which
was
and
is
to
me
right
heartily
welcome
and
with
glad
will
i
received
it
and
over
that
i
had
a
letter
from
holake
your
gentle
squire
by
the
which
i
understand
right
well
that
ye
be
in
good
health
of
body
and
merry
at
heart
and
i
pray
god
heartily
in
his
pleasure
to
continue
the
same
for
it
is
to
me
very
great
comfort
that
he
so
be
so
help
me
jesu
and
if
ye
would
be
a
good
eater
of
your
meat
alway
that
ye
might
wax
and
grow
fast
to
be
a
woman
ye
should
make
me
the
gladdest
man
of
the
world
by
my
troth
for
when
i
remember
your
favour
and
your
sad
loving
dealing
to
me
wards
for
sooth
ye
make
me
even
very
glad
and
joyous
in
my
heart
and
on
the
tother
side
again
when
i
remember
your
young
youth
and
see
well
that
ye
be
none
eater
of
your
meat
the
which
should
help
you
greatly
in
waxing
for

me
very
heavy
again
and

pray
you
mine
own
sweet
cousin
even
as
you
love
me
to
be
merry
and
eat
your
meat
like
a
woman
and
if

will
so
do
for
my
love
look
what
ye
will
desire
of
me
whatsoever
it
be
and
by
my
troth
i
promise
you
by
the
help
of
our
lord
to
perform
it
to
my
power

can
no
more
say
now
but
on
my

i
will
tell

much
more
between
you
and
me
and

hearty
love
and
favour
i
send
them
to
you
mine

sweet
cousin
again
for
to
keep
by
you
and
over
that
i
send
you
the
blessing
that
our
lady
gave
her
dear
son
and
ever
well
to
fare
i
pray
you
greet
well
my
horse
and
pray
him
to
give
you
four
of
his
years
to
help
you
withal
and
i
will
at
my
coming
home
give
him
four
of
my
years
and
four
horse
loaves
till
amends
tell
him
that
i
prayed
him
so
and
cousin
katherine
i
thank
you
for
him
and
my
wife
shall
thank
you
for
him
hereafter
for
ye
do
great
cost
upon
him
as
is
told
me
mine
own
sweet
cousin
it
was
told
me
but
late
that
ye
were
at
calais
j
to
seek
me
but
could
not
see
me
nor
find
me
forsooth
ye
might
have
comen
to
my
counter
and
there
ye
should
both
find
me
and
see
me
and
not
have
faulted
of
me
but
ye
sought
me
in
a
wrong
calais
and
that
ye
should
well
know
if
ye
were
here
and
saw
this
calais
as
would
god
ye
were
and
some
of
them
with
you
that
were
with
you
at
your
gentle
calais
i
pray
you
gentle
cousin
commend
me
to
the
clock
and
pray
him
to
amend
his
unthrifty
manners
for
he
strikes
ever
in
undue
time
and
he
will
be
ever
afore
and
that
is
a
shrewd
condition
tell
him
without
he
amend
his
condition
that
he
will
cause
strangers
to
avoid
and
come
no
more
there
i
trust
to
you
that
he
shall
amend
against
mine
coming
the
which
shall
be
shortly
with
all
hands
and
all
feet
with
god
grace
my
very
faithful
cousin
i
trust
to
you
that
though
all
i
have
not
remembered
my
right
worshipful
mistress
your
mother
afore
in
this
letter
that
ye
will
of
your
gentleness
recommend
me
to
her
mistresship
as
many
times
as
it
shall
please
you
and
ye
may
say
if
it
please
you
that
in
whitsun
week
next
i
intend
to
the
mart
ward
and
i
trust
you
will
pray
for
me
for
i
shall
pray
for
you
and
so
it
may
be
none
so
well
and
almighty
jesu
make
you
a
good
woman
and
send
you
many
good
years
and
long
to
live
in
health
and
virtue
to
his
pleasure
at
great
calais
on
this
side
on
the
sea
the
first
day
of
june
when
every
man
was
gone
to
his
dinner
and
the
clock
smote
nine
and
all
your
household
cried
after
me
and
bade
me
down
come
down
to
dinner
at
once
and
what
answer
i
gave
them
ye
know
it
of
old
footnote
j
possibly
an
inn
with
that
name
by
your
faithful
cousin
and
lover
thomas
betson
i
send
you
this
ring
for
a
token
so
ending
thomas
betson
smiled
dropped
a
kiss
on
the
seal
and
inscribed
his
letter
my
faithful
and
heartily
beloved
cousin
katherine
riche
at
stonor
this
letter
be
delivered
in
haste
henceforth
there
begins
a
charming
triangular
correspondence
between
betson
and
stonor
and
dame
elizabeth
stonor
in
which
family
news
and
business
negotiations
are
pleasantly
mingled
dame
elizabeth
and
betson
were
on
the
best
of
terms
for
they
had
been
old
friends
before
her
second
marriage
a
special
chamber
was
kept
for
him
at
stonor
and
by
an
affectionate
anticipation
she
often
refers
to
him
as
son
stonor
almost
all
her
letters
to
her
husband
contain
news
of
him
how
he
took
his
barge
at
in
the
morning
and
god
speed
him
how
no
writing
has
come
from
him
these
eight
days
how
he
has
now
written
about
the
price
to
be
paid
for
forty
sacks
of
cotswold
wool
how
he
recommends
him
to
sir
william
and
came
home
last
monday
sometimes
he
is
entrusted
with
the
delicate
business
of
interviewing
dame
elizabeth
mother
a
difficult
old
lady
with
a
tongue
send
her
says
thomas
mopping
his
brow
after
one
of
these
interviews
a
merry
countenance
or
shortly
to
the
minories
k
after
another
he
writes
to
dame
elizabeth
i
came
home
to
london
i
met
with
my
lady
your
mother
and
god
wot
she
made
me
right
sullen
cheer
with
her
countenance
whiles
i
was
with
her
methought
it
long
till
i
was
departed
she
break
out
to
me
of
her
old
ffernyeres
and
specially
she
brake
to
me
of
the
tale
i
told
her
between
the
vicar
that
was
and
her
she
said
the
vicar
never
fared
well
sith
he
took
it
so
much
to
heart
i
told
her
a
light
answer
again
and
so
i
departed
from
her
i
had
no
joy
to
tarry
with
her
she
is
a
fine
merry
woman
but
ye
shall
not
know
it
nor
yet
find
it
nor
none
of
yours
by
that
i
see
in
her
it
was
the
faithful
betson
too
who
was
chosen
to
look
after
his
katherine
little
sister
anne
when
she
was
ill
in
london
and
he
writes
home
asking
for
her
clothes
hath
need
unto
them
and
that
knoweth
our
lord
and
complaining
of
the
old
grandmother
behaviour
my
lady
your
mother
meet
my
cousin
anne
she
will
say
no
more
but
god
blessing
have
ye
and
mine
and
so
go
her
way
forth
as
though
she
had
no
joy
of
her
it
was
betson
too
who
escorted
dame
elizabeth
when
need
was
from
windsor
to
london
and
wrote
to
her
husband
the
way
we
were
right
merry
thanked
be
god
and
so
with
his
mercy
we
mean
here
to
be
merry
for
the
season
that
my
lady
is
here
and
when
your
mastership
is
ready
to
come
hitherwards
we
here
shall
so
welcome
you
that
the
season
of
your
abiding
shall
not
be
noisome
with
god
grace
whereupon
sir
william
sends
a
present
of
capons
by
the
carrier
to
assist
the
merriment
and
betson
reports
i
took
two
capons
but
they
were
not
the
best
as
ye
counselled
me
by
your
letter
to
take
and
indeed
to
say
the
truth
i
could
not
be
suffered
my
lady
your
wife
is
reasonably
strong
waxed
the
lord
be
thanked
and
she
took
her
will
in
that
matter
like
as
she
doth
in
all
other
footnote
k
the
convent
of
minoresses
or
franciscan
nuns
outside
aldgate
there
are
indeed
a
hundred
evidences
of
the
warmth
of
affection
for
the
stonors
and
of
the
simple
piety
of
his
character
sometimes
he
ventures
to
give
them
good
advice
dame
elizabeth
was
somewhat
uplifted
by
her
elevation
from
the
ranks
of
the
mercantile
bourgeoisie
to
a
place
among
the
country
gentry
and
was
apt
to
be
extravagant
nor
was
her
husband
entirely
guiltless
of
running
up
bills
we
hear
of
the
ale
brewer
and
the
bread
baker
calling
daily
upon
his
agent
for
money
and
on
one
occasion
the
stonors
owed
over
to
betson
own
brother
a
vintner
for
various
pipes
of
red
and
white
wine
and
a
butt
of
rumney
l
so
thomas
writes
to
dame
elizabeth
on
his
way
to
the
mart
blessed
lord
jesus
christ
preserve
you
both
in
honour
and
worship
virtuously
to
continue
in
god
pleasure
and
also
to
send
you
good
and
profitable
counsel
and
grace
to
do
hereafter
this
is
and
shall
be
my
prayer
forsooth
every
day
your
honour
and
worship
of
countenance
hereafter
sticketh
as
nigh
mine
heart
as
doth
any
friend
man
or
other
about
you
by
my
troth
our
blessed
lord
so
help
me
i
will
avise
you
madame
to
remember
large
expenses
and
beware
of
them
and
in
likewise
my
master
your
husband
it
is
well
done
ye
remember
him
of
them
for
divers
considerations
as
ye
know
both
right
well
and
our
blessed
lord
be
your
comforter
and
help
in
all
your
good
work
amen
a
month
later
he
hears
that
william
stonor
has
been
ill
and
writes
to
sympathize
with
dame
elizabeth
if
i
could
do
anything
here
that
might
be
to
his
pleasure
and
yours
i
would
i
knew
it
and
it
should
be
done
withouten
fail
truly
your
discomfort
is
not
my
comfort
god
knoweth
it
nevertheless
your
ladyship
must
cause
him
to
be
merry
and
of
glad
cheer
and
to
put
away
all
fantasies
and
unthrifty
thoughts
that
comes
no
good
of
but
only
hurtful
a
man
may
hurt
himself
by
riotous
means
it
is
good
to
beware

meanwhile
what
of
little
katherine
riche
she
recurs
over
and
over
in
thomas
betson
letters
occasionally
she
is
in
disgrace
for
she
was
not
handy
with
her
pen
am
wroth
with
katherine
writes
he
to
her
mother
she
sendeth
me
no
writing
i
have
to
her
divers
times
and
for
lack
of
answer
i
wax
weary
she
might
get
a
secretary
if
she
would
and
if
she
will
not
it
shall
put
me
to
less
labour
to
answer
her
letters
again
but
the
important
thing
is
that
she
grows
steadily
older
though
not
quickly
enough
to
please
our
lover
on
trinity
sunday
in
he
writes
to
dame
elizabeth
remember
her
full
oft
god
know
eth
it
i
dreamed
once
she
was
thirty
winters
of
age
and
when
i
woke
i
wished
she
had
been
but
twenty
and
so
by
likelihood
i
am
sooner
like
to
have
my
wish
than
my
dream
the
which
i
beseech
almighty
jesu
heartily
when
it
shall
please
him
and
to
the
lady
stepfather
he
writes
a
month
later
beseech
you
to
remember
my
cousin
katherine
i
would
she
did
well
god
knoweth
it
and
ye
deme
as
i
trow
if
i
had
found
her
at
home
here
my
comfort
should
have
been
the
more
but
i
thank
god
of
all
my
pain
is
the
more
i
must
needs
suffer
as
i
have
done
in
times
past
and
so
will
i
do
for
god
sake
and
hers
however
katherine
was
now
fifteen
years
of
age
and
was
sufficiently
grown
up
to
wed
and
the
next
letter
written
a
week
later
to
dame
elizabeth
shows
us
thomas
betson
beginning
to
set
his
house
in
order
and
getting
exceedingly
bothered
about
laying
in
her
trousseau
a
business
with
which
dame
elizabeth
had
it
seems
entrusted
the
future
bridegroom
madam
and
it
like
you
i
understand
by
your
writing
that
it
will
be
the
latter
end
of
august
or
your
ladyship
can
come
here
to
london
and
if
it
should
be
so
i
would
be
sorry
for
i
have
much
to
do
and
i
can
little
skill
to
do
anything
that
longeth
to
the
matter
ye
wot
of
evidently
the
preparations
for
katherine
i
must
beseech
your
ladyship
to
send
me
your
advice
how
i
shall
be
demeaned
in
such
things
as
shall
belong
unto
my
cousin
katherine
and
how
i
shall
provide
for
them
she
must
have
girdles
three
at
the
least
and
how
they
shall
be
made
i
know
not
and
many
other
things
she
must
have
ye
know
well
what
they
be
in
faith
i
know
not
by
my
troth
i
would
it
were
done
liever
than
more
than
it
shall
cost
and
as
for
the
sending
hither
of
my
cousin
katherine
your
ladyship
may
do
therein
as
it
shall
please
you
i
would
she
knew
as
much
as
you
know
forsooth
and
then
she
should
do
some
good
and
help
me
in
many
things
when
she
come
also
madam
as
ye
write
me
the
courteous
dealing
of
my
master
with
my
cousin
katherine
truly
i
am
very
glad
thereof
and
i
pray
god
heartily
thank
him
therefore
for
he
hath
ever
been
lovingly
disposed
unto
her
and
so
i
beseech
god
ever
continue
him
and
also
my
cousin
katherine
to
deserve
it
unto
him
by
her
goodly
demeanour
and
womanly
disposition
as
she
can
do
right
well
if
her
list
and
so
saith
every
body
that
praiseth
her
the
note
of
pride
in
the
last
words
is
as
engaging
as
the
impatience
of
the
harassed
male
faced
with
the
choosing
of
girdles
even
more
charming
is
the
letter
which
he
wrote
the
same
day
to
sir
william
stonor
he
is
a
little
incoherent
with
joy
and
gratitude
full
of
regrets
that
business
keeps
him
from
stonor
and
good
wishes
for
the
health
of
the
family
fare
like
a
sorry
piper
he
says
i
begin
i
can
not
leave
but
yet
once
again
our
blessed
lord
be
your
speed
and
your
help
of
katherine
he
writes
thus
i
understand
by
the
worshipful
report
of
your
mastership
the
be
haviours
of
my
cousin
katherine
unto
you
to
my
lady
your
wife
and
to
all
other
etc
and
truly
it
is
to
me
right
joyful
and
comfortable
gladness
to

of

footnote
m
call
the
banns
this
letter
was
written
on
june
and
thomas
probably
married
his
little
katherine
in
august
or
september
for
when
dame
elizabeth
writes
to
her
husband
on
october
she
says
son
betson
and
his
wife
recommend
them
to
you
the
poor
child
was
to
learn
soon
enough
some
of
the
sorrows
of
a
wife
for
a
year
later
thomas
betson
fell
dangerously
ill
and
she
was
nursing
him
and
looking
after
his
business
for
all
the
world
as
though
she
were
a
grave
matron
and
not
a
bride
of
sixteen
moreover
she
must
already
have
been
expecting
the
birth
of
her
eldest
son
william
stonor
attitude
towards
his
partner
illness
is
not
without
humour
he
was
torn
between
anxiety
for
the
life
of
a
friend
and
an
even
greater
anxiety
that
betson
should
not
die
without
setting
straight
the
business
obligations
between
them
we
hear
of
the
illness
and
of
katherine
labours
in
a
letter
from
one
of
stonor
agents
to
his
master
sir
according
to
the
commandment
of
your
mastership
we
were
at
stepney
by
nine
of
the
clock
at
such
time
as
we
came
thither
we
saw
the
gentleman
forthwith
and
in
good
faith
he
made
us
good
cheer
as
a
sick
man
might
by
countenance
notwithstanding
for
in
good
faith
we
saw
by
his
demeanour
that
he
might
not
prosper
in
this
world
for
mistress
bevice
and
other
gentlewomen
and
his
uncle
were
of
the
same
opinion
and
we
desired
and
prayed
him
to
be
of
good
comfort
and
so
comforted
him
as
heartily
as
we
could
in
your
name
and
in
my
lady
and
so
we
departed
from
the
chamber
down
into
the
hall
and
he
fell
into
a
great
slumbering
and
was
busily
moved
in
his
spirits
and
at
eleven
of
the
clock
i
called
his
uncle
out
of
his
bed
into
the
gentleman
chamber
and
i
asked
his
advice
and
my
mistress
his
wife
of
the
stock
and
of
the
demeanour
thereof
for
the
year
and
the
half
that
is
last
past
and
touching
the
stock
he
confessed
that
it
was
wherein
at
the
sight
of
your
acquittance
in
discharging
of
him
and
all
his
doers
that
shall
be
behind
him
the
said
stock
shall
be
ready
and
as
for
the
occupation
of
it
as
he
will
answer
between
god
and
devil
the
book
that
he
bought
it
by
ye
shall
be
privy
thereto
and
the
book
that
he
sold
by
ye
shall
be
also
privy
to
which
two
books
shall
be
his
judges
which
remain
in
the
keeping
of
my
mistress
his
wife
hands
under
lock
and
key
and
other
bills
and
obligations
according
concerning
the
surety
for
divers
payments
to
be
made
to
divers
merchants
as
the
said
lord
saith
and
as
for
the
plate
my
mistress
jane
probably
jane
riche
the
younger
sister
of
katherine
and
i
have
caused
it
to
be
taken
up
and
set
in
surety
save
that
that
must
needs
by
occupied
he
sends
to
sir
william
for
information
about
two
sums
of
each
owed
by
betson
to
his
master
and
mistress
and
adds
i
trust
to
jesu
he
shall
endure
till
the
messenger
come
again
longer
the
physicians
have
not
determined
the
executors
be
three
persons
my
mistress
his
wife
humphrey
starkey
recorder
of
london
robert
tate
merchant
of
calais
notwithstanding
i
moved
him
between
him
and
me
and
mistress
jane
that
he
should
break
this
testament
and
make
my
mistress
his
wife
sole
executrix
what
will
be
done
therein
as
yet
i
can
not
speak
but
i
shall
do
as
i
can
with
god
grace
there
is
something
unexpected
and
a
little
about
this
gathering
of
creditors
and
seizing
of
plate
about
the
of
a
man
who
had
always
after
all
shown
himself
exceedingly
affectionate
towards
the
stonors
and
devoted
to
their
interests
and
who
was
now
my
lady
the
attempt
to
make
the
young
wife
of
sixteen
sole
executrix
so
that
she
might
be
completely
in
her
family
hands
and
without
the
counsel
of
two
experienced
and
disinterested
merchants
has
a
somewhat
sinister
air
the
intrigues
went
on
and
three
days
later
the
agent
writes
again
it
is
pleasant
to
observe
that
old
mistress
croke
dame
elizabeth
mother
was
not
unmindful
of
forbearance
during
those
visits
when
she
had
railed
upon
him
with
her
sharp
tongue
as
for
the
tidings
that
is
here
i
trust
to
god
it
shall
be
very
good
on
thursday
my
lady
croke
came
to
stepney
and
brought
with
her
master
brinkley
to
see
betson
and
in
faith
he
was
a
very
sick
man
and
ere
he
departed
he
gave
him
plasters
to
his
head
to
his
stomach
and
to
his
belly
so
that
he
all
that
night
was
in
a
quiet
rest
and
he
came
to
him
again
on
friday
and
he
was
well
amended
and
so
said
all
the
people
that
were
about
him
notwithstanding
he
will
not
determine
him
whether
he
shall
live
or
die
as
yet
but
he
may
keep
him
alive
till
tuesday
noon
he
will
undertake
him
the
cause
that
i
write
to
you
now
rather
was
because
i
had
no
certainty
sir
there
hath
been
many
special
labours
and
secret
sithen
mistress
jane
and
i
were
come
to
the
contrary
disposition
that
we
come
for
i
can
not
write
the
plain
nes
s
of
them
as
yet
for
my
mistress
betson
attendeth
all
things
and
counsels
laid
apart
to
abide
and
trust
in
your
good
fatherhood
and
in
my
lady
and
furthermore
if
he
depart
the
world
ye
shall
hear
tidings
of
her
in
as
goodly
haste
as
we
may
purvey
for
her
and
whether
he
die
or
live
it
is
necessary
and
behoveful
that
mistress
jane
depart
not
from
her
into
until
such
time
as
the
certainty
be
knowen
for
in
truth
divers
folks
which
ye
shall
know
hereafter
and
my
lady
both
thus
hath
and
would
exhort
her
to
a
contrarier
disposition
had
not
we
been
here
by
time
and
mistress
jane
is
worthy
of
much
thank
however
all
the
schemings
were
premature
for
betson
happily
recovered
on
october
the
henham
writes
master
betson
is
right
well
amended
blessed
be
jesus
and
he
is
past
all
doubts
of
sickness
and
he
takes
the
sustenance
right
well
and
as
for
physicians
there
come
none
unto
him
for
he
hath
no
need
of
them
but
another
death
was
at
hand
to
break
the
close
association
between
thomas
betson
and
the
stonors
for
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
kind
extravagant
affectionate
dame
elizabeth
died
it
is
a
surprising
fact
that
her
death
seems
to
have
brought
to
a
close
the
business
partnership
between
her
husband
and
her
henceforth
the
only
references
to
thomas
betson
in
the
stonor
papers
are
occasional
notes
of
his
debts
to
stonor
doubtless
he
had
bought
sir
william
share
in
their
joint
business
on
march
he
acknowledged
obligations
of
to
stonor
and
in
he
still
owed
it
is
impossible
to
guess
why
the
relationship
which
was
an
affectionate
personal
friendship
as
well
as
a
business
tie
should
have
come
to
such
a
sudden
end
as
the
editor
of
the
remarks
sincerity
and
honesty
of
character
as
revealed
in
his
letters
forbids
one
to
suppose
that
he
was
to
blame
such
was
the
more
private
and
domestic
side
of
thomas
betson
life
but
it
tells
us
little
save
in
occasional
references
to
the
fellowship
of
the
staple
or
the
price
of
cotswold
wool
about
that
great
company
with
which
this
chapter
began
and
since
he
stands
here
as
a
type
as
well
as
an
individual
we
must
needs
turn
now
to
his
public
and
business
life
and
try
to
find
out
from
more
indirect
evidence
how
a
merchant
of
the
staple
went
about
his
business
the
stapler
who
would
make
a
good
livelihood
must
do
two
things
and
give
his
best
attention
to
both
of
them
first
he
must
buy
his
wool
from
the
english
grower
then
he
must
sell
it
to
the
foreign
buyer
some
of
the
best
wool
in
england
came
from
the
cotswolds
and
when
you
are
a
merchant
of
the
staple
you
enjoy
bargaining
for
it
whether
you
want
the
proceeds
of
the
great
summer
clip
or
of
the
fells
after
the
autumn
so
thomas
betson
rides
off
to
gloucestershire
in
the
soft
spring
weather
his
good
sorrel
between
his
knees
and
the
scent
of
the
hawthorn
blowing
round
him
as
he
goes
other
wool
merchants
ride
farther
afield
into
the
long
dales
of
yorkshire
to
bargain
with
cistercian
abbots
for
the
wool
from
their
huge
flocks
but
he
and
the
celys
swear
by
cotswold
fells
he
shipped
of
them
to
london
one
july
the
names
of
sir
william
stonor
knight
and
thomas
betson
in
the
of
london
john
lolyngton
master
under
god
may
is
the
great
month
for
purchases
and
northleach
the
great
of
staplers
and
wool
dealers
it
is
no
wonder
that
northleach
church
is
so
full
of
woolmen
brasses
for
often
they
knelt
there
and
often
the
village
hummed
with
the
buyers
and
sellers
exchanging
orders
and
examining
samples
the
celys
bought
chiefly
from
two
northleach
wool
dealers
william
midwinter
and
john
busshe
the
relations
between
dealers
and
sellers
were
often
enough
close
and
pleasant
midwinter
even
occasionally
tried
to
provide
a
customer
with
a
bride
as
well
as
with
a
cargo
and
marriageable
young
ladies
were
not
unwilling
to
be
examined
over
a
gallon
of
wine
and
much
good
cheer
at
the
inn
it
is
true
that
midwinter
was
apt
to
be
restive
when
his
bills
remained
for
too
long
unpaid
but
he
may
be
forgiven
for
that
thomas
betson
favoured
the
wool
fells
of
robert
turbot
of
lamberton
and
dealt
also
with
one
john
tate
with
whyte
of
broadway
another
famous
wool
village
and
with
john
elmes
a
henley
merchant
well
known
to
the
stonors
midwinter
busshe
and
elmes
were
all
wool
dealers
or
middlemen
that
is
to
say
between
the
farmers
who
grew
and
the
staplers
who
bought
wool
but
often
the
staplers
dealt
directly
with
individual
farmers
buying
the
small
man
clip
as
well
as
the
great
man
and
warm
friendships
sprang
from
the
annual
visits
looked
forward
to
in
yorkshire
dale
and
cotswold
valley
it
strikes
a
pleasant
note
when
richard
russell
citizen
and
merchant
of
york
leaves
in
his
will
distribution
among
the
farmers
of
yorkes
walde
from
whom
i
bought
wool
and
in
the
same
way
among
the
farmers
of
lyndeshay
the
letters
give
a
mass
of
information
about
the
wool
buying
at
northleach
in
the
may
of
the
same
year
in
which
betson
partnership
with
stonor
would
seem
to
have
ended
old
richard
cely
was
up
there
doing
business
and
reporting
it
to
his
son
cely
at
caleys
i
greet
you
well

i
have
received
a
letter
from
you
writ
at
calais

day
of
may

which
letter

at
the
marts
and
of
the
sale
of
my
middle

past
the

but
i

but
i
will

these
holy
days
for
the
which
i
will
ye
order
for

freight
and
other
costs
this
same
day
your
brother
richard
cely
is
rid
to
northleach
for
to
see
and
cast
a
sort
of
fell
for
me
and
another
sort
of
fell
for
you
on
another
occasion
he
writes
your
letter
you
avise
me
for
to
buy
wool
in
cotswold
for
which
i
shall
have
of
john
cely
his
gathering
sack
and
of
will
midwinter
of
northleach
sack
and
i
am
avised
to
buy
no
more
wool
in
cotswold
is
at
great
price
a
tod
and
great
riding
for
wool
in
cotswold
as
was
any
year
this
seven
year
what
a
picture
it
calls
up
of
merchants
trotting
along
the
roads
and
looking
as
chaucer
often
saw
them
look
a
marchant
was
ther
with
a
forked
berd
in
motteleye
and
hye
on
horse
he
sat
upon
his
heed
a
flaundryssh
bever
hat
his
boots
clasped
faire
and
fetisly
his
resons
he
spak
ful
solempnely
sounynge
alway
thencrees
of
his
wynnyng
often
at
northleach
betson
must
have
encountered
his
brethren
of
the
staple
the
staid
old
merchant
richard
cely
among
the
rest
and
son
george
who
rides
with
his
hawk
on
his
wrist
and
has
a
horse
called
and
another
called
and
perhaps
also
john
barton
of
holme
beside
newark
the
proud
stapler
who
set
as
a
in
the
stained
glass
windows
of
his
house
this
motto
i
thank
god
and
ever
shall
it
is
the
sheepe
hath
payed
for
all
though
indeed
it
is
unlikely
that
he
came
as
far
south
as
the
cotswolds
for
his
wool
sometimes
also
betson
meets
upon
the
road
his
rivals
stout
flemings
and
thin
sleek
lombards
with
black
eyes
and
gesticulating
hands
who
have
no
business
in
the
cotswolds
at
all
but
ought
to
be
buying
wool
in
the
mart
at
calais
but
they
come
and
all
good
englishmen
are
angry
at
their
tricks
and
angrier
still
perhaps
at
their
successful
trade
have
not
as
yet
packed
my
wool
in
london
writes
old
richard
cely
on
october
have
i
not
bought
this
year
a
lock
of
wool
for
the
wool
of
cotswold
is
bought
by
lombards
wherefore
i
have
the
less
haste
for
to
pack
my
wool
at
london
and
his
son
writes
to
him
on
november
from
calais
is
but
little
cotswold
wool
at
calais
and
i
understand
lombards
has
bought
it
up
in
england
it
is
true
that
the
celys
other
english
merchants
too
are
not
unwilling
to
conclude
private
bargains
from
time
to
time
with
foreign
buyers
in
england
two
years
later
their
agent
william
cely
writes
to
advise
them
that
two
flemish
merchants
are
now
trying
to
buy
in
england
contrary
to
the
ordinance
and
that
those
in
authority
at
calais
have
got
wind
of
it
and
therefore
his
masters
must
take
care
and
make
wyllykyn
and
peter
bale
pay
at
calais
as
for
your
dealings
knoweth
no
man
without
they
search
peter
bale
books
the
upright
betson
no
doubt
eschewed
such
tricks
and
resented
particularly
the
clever
usurious
lombards
so
full
of
financial
dodges
to
trick
the
english
merchant
for
did
they
not
buy
the
wool
in
england
on
credit
riding
about
as
they
list
in
the
cotswolds
in
cotteswolde
also
they
ryde
aboute
and
al
englonde
and
bien
wythouten
doute
what
them
liste
wythe
fredome
and
fraunchise
more
then
we
englisshe
may
getyn
in
any
wyse
and
then
did
they
not
carry
the
wool
to
flanders
and
sell
it
for
ready
money
at
a
loss
of
five
per
cent
thereafter
lending
out
this
money
at
heavy
usury
mostly
to
the
english
merchants
themselves
so
that
by
the
time
pay
day
came
in
england
they
had
realized
a
heavy
profit
and
thus
they

the
next
serious
piece
of
business
thomas
betson
must
take
in
hand
is
the
packing
and
shipping
of
his
wool
to
calais
here
he
found
himself
enmeshed
in
the
regulations
of
the
company
and
the
crown
ever
on
the
for
fraud
in
the
packing
or
description
of
the
staple
product
the
wool
had
to
be
packed
in
the
county
from
which
it
came
and
there
were
strict
regulations
against
mixing
hair
and
earth
or
rubbish
with
it
the
collectors
appointed
by
the
company
for
the
different
districts
and
sworn
in
before
the
exchequer
rode
round
and
sealed
each
package
so
that
it
could
not
be
opened
without
breaking
the
seal
then
the
great
bales
were
carried
on
the
backs
of
the
ancient
trackways
over
the
wiltshire
and
hampshire
downs
which
had
been
used
before
the
roman
conquest
and
thence
through
surrey
and
kent
to
the
medway
ports
by
the
pilgrims
way
at
the
different
ports
the
collectors
of
customs
were
ready
to
enter
on
their
rolls
the
names
of
the
merchants
shipping
wool
together
with
the
quantity
and
description
of
wool
shipped
by
each
some
of
the
wool
came
to
london
itself
where
many
of
the
staplers
had
offices
in
mark
lane
which
is
a
corruption
of
mart
lane
and
was
weighed
for
the
assessment
of
the
customs
and
subsidy
at
the
leadenhall
in
this
business
thomas
betson
was
helped
by
stonor
three
assistants
or
as
they
call
themselves
thomas
henham
goddard
oxbridge
and
thomas
howlake
for
the
last
of
whom
he
had
a
warm
corner
in
his
heart
because
the
young
man
was
gentle
to
little
katherine
riche
these
men
were
sometimes
at
the
stonors
london
warehouse
and
sometimes
at
their
house
in
calais
and
they
saved
betson
a
good
deal
of
trouble
being
experienced
enough
to
oversee
both
the
packing
of
wool
in
london
and
its
sale
in
calais
to
calais
the
wool
thus
packed
and
weighed
and
marked
and
assessed
by
the
customs
officer
was
carried
in
the
ships
of
calais
itself
or
of
the
little
ports
on
the
east
or
coast
of
england
many
of
which
are

walberswick

rainham

bradwell
maidstone
milton

in
august
the
celys
were
paying
the
masters
of
different
ships
for
the
freight
of
their
sarplers
of
wool
after
the
summer
clip
all
through
the
summer
the
shipping
went
on
and
right
up
to
christmas
but
during
the
winter
months
the
merchants
were
mostly
sending
over
fells
or
sheepskins
after
the
great
slaughter
of
sheep
and
cattle
which
took
place
at
martinmas
when
housewives
salted
down
their
meat
for
the
winter
and
farmers
made
delivery
of
the
fells
and
hides
for
which
the
staplers
had
long
ago
bargained
very
often

scarcely

the

have
been
only

if
she
had
to
pass
aylesford

but
they
navigated
the
channel
and
dodged
the
pirates
blithely
enough
though
often
thomas

at

was
nervous
about

with

blowing
out
the

in

breathed

n

thursday
thomas
betson
and
the
celys
travelled
very
often
across
the
channel
in
these
ships
which
carried
passengers
and
letters
and
they
were
almost
as
much
at
home
in
calais
as
in
london
when
in
calais
english
merchants
were
not
allowed
to
live
anywhere
they
liked
all
over
the
town
the
company
of
the
staple
had
a
list
of
regular
licensed
in
whose
houses
they
might
stay
usually
a
number
of
merchants
lived
with
each
host
the
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
seniors
dining
at
a
high
table
and
smaller
fry
at
side
tables
in
the
hall
sometimes
they
quarrelled
over
terms
as
when
william
cely
writes
home
one
day
to
richard
and
george
in
london
item
sir
please
it
you
to
understand
that
here
is
a
variance
betwixt
our
host
thomas
graunger
and
the
fellowship
of
our
lodging
for
thomas
graunger
promised
us
at
his
coming
in
to
our
lodging
that
we
should
pay
no
more
for
our
board
but
a
week
at
the
high
table
and
at
the
side
table
and
now
he
saith
he
will
have
no
less
than
a
week
at
the
high
table
and
at
the
side
table
wherefore
the
fellowship
here
will
depart
into
other
lodgings
some
to
one
place
and
some
to
another
william
dalton
will
be
at
robert
torneys
and
ralph
temyngton
and
master
brown
man
of
stamford
shall
be
at
thomas
clarke
and
so
all
the
fellowship
departs
save
i
wherefore
i
let
your
masterships
have
knowledge
that
ye
may
do
as
it
shall
like
you
best
but
thomas
betson
never
fell
out
with
his
hosts
whose
only
complaint
of
him
must
have
been
that
he
sat
long
over
his
love
letters
and
came
down
late
to
dinner
there
was
business
enough
for
him
to
do
at
calais
first
of
all
when
the
wool
was
landed
it
had
to
be
inspected
by
the
royal
officers
to
see
that
it
had
been
properly
labelled
and
their
skilled
packers
examined
repacked
and
resealed
the
bales
this
was
an
anxious
moment
for
merchants
who
were
conscious
of
inferior
wool
among
their
bulging
sarplers
the
honest
betson
we
may
be
certain
never
cheated
but
the
celys
knew
more
than
a
little
about
the
tricks
of
the
trade
and
one
year
when
the
lieutenant
of
calais
took
out
sarpler
no
which
their
agent
william
cely
knew
to
be
poor
wool
in
order
to
make
a
test
he
privily
substitutes
no
which
was
wool
and
changed
the
labels
so
that
he
was
soon
able
to
write
home
wool
is
awarded
by
the
sarpler
that
i
cast
out
last
no
wonder
gower
said
that
trick
was
regent
of
the
staple
le

maintenir

then
there
was
the
custom
and
subsidy
to
be
paid
to
the
mayor
and
fellowship
of
the
staple
who
collected
it
for
the
king
and
then
came
the
main
business
of
every
merchant
the
selling
of
the
wool
thomas
betson
preferred
of
course
to
sell
it
as
quickly
as
possible
as
the
ships
came
in
but
sometimes
the
market
was
slow
and
wool
remained
for
some
months
on
his
hands
such
wool
from
the
summer
sheep
shearing
shipped
in
or
before
the
month
of
february
following
and
remaining
unsold
by
april
was
classed
as
old
wool
and
the
fellowship
of
the
staple
ordained
that
foreign
buyers
must
take
one
sarpler
of
old
wool
with
every
three
of
new
and
although
the
flemings
grumbled
and
wanted
to
take
one
of
old
to
five
of
new
they
had
to
put
up
with
the
regulation
a
great
deal
of
betson
business
would
be
done
at
the
mart
of
calais
itself
where
he
met
with
the
dignified
flemish
merchants
scions
of
old
families
with
estates
of
their
own
and
the
more
plebeian
merchants
of
delft
and
leyden
and
the
wool
dealers
from
sunny
florence
and
genoa
and
venice
among
the
best
customers
both
of
the
stonors
and
the
celys
for
they
are
mentioned
in
the
letters
of
both
were

for

the

respite
of

however

enough
political
disturbances
made
the
roads
dangerous
and
merchants
ran
some
risk
of
being
robbed
the
english
traders
were
commonly
reputed
to
be
the
best
sellers
and
customers
at
the
fairs
of
flanders
and
brabant
though
the
flemings
sometimes
complained
of
them
and
said
that
the
staplers
made
regulations
forbidding
their
merchants
to
buy
except
on
the
last
day
when
the
flemish
sellers
anxious
to
pack
and
be
off
let
their
goods
go
at
insufficient
prices

but
there
were
during
the
year
four
great
fair
seasons
corresponding
to
the
four
seasons
in
the
year
there
was
the
cold
mart
in
the
winter
to
which
thomas
betson
rode
muffled
in
fur
with
his
horse
hoofs
ringing
on
the
frosty
roads
there
was
the
pask
easter
mart
in
the
spring
when
he
whistled
blithely
and
stuck
a
violet
in
his
cap
there
was
the
synxon
st
john
mart
in
the
summer
round
about
st
john
the
day
when
he
was
hot
and
mopped
his
brow
and
bought
a
roll
of
tawny
satin
or
lucca
silk
for
katherine
from
a
genoese
in
a
booth
at
antwerp
and
there
was
the
balms
or
bammys
mart
in
the
autumn
round
about
the
day
of
st
rémy
whom
the
flemings
call
st
bamis
october
when
he
would
buy
her
a
fur
of
budge
or
mink
or
a
mantle
of
fine
black
shanks
from
the
hansards
at
their
mart
in
bruges
it
was
at
these
marts
that
the
merchants
of
the
staple
jaunting
about
from
place
to
place
to
meet
buyers
for
their
wool
did
a
hundred
little
commissions
for
their
friends
for
folk
at
home
were
apt
to
think
that
staplers
existed
to
do
their
errands
for
them
abroad
and
to
send
them
presents
one
wanted
a
pair
of
louvain
gloves
the
other
a
sugar
loaf
the
other
a
pipe
of
gascon
wine
can
get
it
cheaper
over
there
my
dear
the
other
a
yard
or
two
of
holland
cloth
while
ginger
and
saffron
were
always
welcome
and
could
be
bought
from
the
venetians
whom
the
celys
spell
then
of
course
there
were
purchases
to
be
made
in
the
way
of
business
such
as
calais
packthread
and
canvas
from
arras
or
brittany
or
normandy
to
pack
the
bales
of
wool
as
to
the
celys
thomas
betson
was
wont
to
say
that
their
talk
was
of
nothing
but
sport
and
buying
hawks
save
on
one
gloomy
occasion
when
george
cely
rode
for
ten
miles
in
silence
and
then
confided
to
him
that
over
in
england
his
grey
bitch
had
whelped
and
had
fourteen
pups
and
then
died
and
the
pups
with
her
between
the
in
calais
and
the
fairs
and
marts
of
the
country
thomas
betson
would
dispose
of
his
wool
and
fells
but
his
labour
did
not
end
here
for
he
would
now
have
to
embark
upon
the
complicated
business
of
collecting
money
from
his
customers
the
flemish
merchants
and
with
it
paying
his
creditors
in
england
the
cotswold
wool
dealers
it
was
customary
for
the
staplers
to
pay
for
their
wool
by
bills
due
as
a
rule
at
six
months
and
thomas
betson
would
be
hard
put
to
meet
them
if
the
foreign
buyers
delayed
to
pay
him
moreover
his
difficulties
were
inconceivably
complicated
by
the
exchanges
we
think
we
know
something
about
the
difficulty
of
divers
and
fluctuating
exchanges
today
but
we
can
hardly
imagine
the
elaborate
calculations
and
the
constant
disputes
which
racked
the
brain
of
a
merchant
of
the
staple
in
the
fifteenth
century
not
only
did
the
rates
between
england
and
the
continent
constantly
vary
but
as
the
editor
of
the
points
out
number
of
potentates
of
all
kinds
who
claimed
the
privilege
of
issuing
their
own
coinage
and
the
frequently
suspicious
character
of
what
they
uttered
as
gold
and
silver
made
the
matter
of
adjustment
of
values
difficult
for
the
celys
who
were
evidently
obliged
to
take
what
they
could
get
only
imagine
the
difficulties
of
poor
thomas
betson
when
into
his

wandered
in

of
them
all
as
it
was
fixed
for
the
time
being
by
the

and
most
of
them
were
debased

indeed
english
money
enjoyed
an
enviable
good
fame
in
this
respect
until
henry

began
debasing
the
coinage
for
his
own
nefarious
ends
the
letters
of
the
celys
are
full
of
worried
references
to
the

thus
was
passed
the
life
of

of

in
riding
to

in

at

kept
a
sharp
eye
on

quality
of

made
rules
for

and
selling
and
saw
that
he
had
justice
in

court
it
was
in
this
setting
of
hard
and
withal
of
interesting
work
that
thomas

flowered
into

happy

he
was
not
destined
to
live
long
after
his
recovery
from
the
serious
illness
of
perhaps
it
left
him
permanently
delicate
for
he
died
some
six

seven

the

of
has
left

traces
upon
the
life
of
england
architectural
literary
and
social
it
has
filled
our
countryside
with
magnificent
perpendicular
churches
and
gracious
houses
it
has
filled
our
popular
literature
with
old
tales
of
the
worthies
of
england
in
which
the
clothiers
thomas
of
reading
and
jack
of
newbury
rub
elbows
with
friar
bacon
and
robin
hood
it
has
filled
our
shires
with
gentlemen
for
as
defoe
observed
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
of
the
great
families
who
now
pass
for
gentry
in
the
western
counties
have
been
originally
raised
from
and
built
up
by
this
truly
noble
manufacture
it
has
filled
our
census
lists
with
surnames
weaver
webber
webb
sherman
fuller
walker
dyer
and
given
to
every
unmarried
woman
the
designation
of
a
spinster
and
from
the
time
when
the
cloth
trade
ousted
that
of
wool
as
the
chief
export
trade
of
england
down
to
the
time
when
it
was
in
its
turn
ousted
by
iron
and
cotton
it
was
the
foundation
of
england
commercial
greatness
all
crafts
says
old
deloney
was
the
only
chief
for
that
it
was
the
greatest
merchandize
by
the
which
our
country
became
famous
thorowout
all
nations
already
by
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
english
clothiers
were
beginning
to
rival
those
of
the
netherlands
in
the
making
of
fine
cloth
as
witness
chaucer
wife
of
bath
of
she
hadde
swiche
an
haunt
she
passed
hem
of
ypres
and
of
gaunt
and
by
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
all
real
rivalry
was
at
an
end
for
the
english
manufacture
was
so
clearly
victorious
with
the
development
of
the
manufacture
a
change
too
took
place
in
its
organization
it
had
never
been
an
easy
industry
to
organize
on
a
gild
basis
because
the
making
of
a
piece
of
cloth
entailed
so
many
distinct
processes
the
preliminary
processes
of
spinning
and
carding
were
always
performed
by
women
and
children
in
their
cottages
but
the
weavers
who
bought
the
spun
yarn
had
their
gild
and
so
had
the
fullers
who
fulled
it
and
the
shearmen
who
finished
it
and
the
dyers
who
dyed
it
all
could
not
sell
the
finished
piece
of
cloth
and
in
the
group
of
crafts
each
with
its
gild
we
sometimes
find
the
weavers
employing
the
fullers
and
sometimes
the
fullers
the
weavers
moreover
since
weaving
is
a
much
quicker
process
than
spinning
the
weaver
often
wasted
much
time
and
found
it
hard
to
collect
enough
yarn
to
keep
his
loom
busy
and
as
the
market
for
cloth
grew
wider
and
was
no
longer
confined
to
the
town
of
the
weaver
the
need
was
felt
for
some
middleman
to
specialize
in
the
selling
of
the
finished
cloth
so
by
degrees
there
grew
up
a
class
of
men
who
bought
wool
in
large
quantities
and
sold
it
to
the
weavers
and
then
by
a
natural
transition
began
not
to
sell
the
wool
outright
but
to
deliver
it
to
the
weavers
to
weave
to
the
fullers
to
full
and
to
the
shearmen
to
finish
at
a
wage
receiving
it
back
again
when
the
work
was
done
these
men
grew
rich
they
amassed
capital
they
could
set
many
folk
at
work
soon
they
began
to
set
to
work
all
the
different
workers
who
combined
to
make
a
piece
of
cloth
their
servants
carried
wool
to
the
cottages
for
the
women
to
card
and
spin
carried
the
spun
yarn
in
turn
to
dyers
weavers
fullers
shearers
and
carried
the
finished
piece
of
cloth
back
to
the
industrial
middleman
the
clothier
as
he
was
called
who
in
his
turn
disposed
of
it
to
the
mercantile
middleman
who
was
called
a
draper
the
clothiers
grew
rapidly
in
wealth
and
importance
and
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
became
the
backbone
of
the
middle
class
they
pursued
their
activities
in
country
villages
rather
than
in
the
old
corporate
towns
for
they
wished
to
avoid
the
restrictions
of
the
gilds
and
gradually
the
cloth
industry
migrated
almost
entirely
to
the
country
in
the
west
of
england
and
in
east
anglia
though
not
in
yorkshire
it
was
carried
out
by
clothiers
on
this
out
system
right
up
to
the
moment
when
the
industrial
revolution
swept
it
out
of
the
cottages
into
the
factories
and
out
of
the
south
into
the
north
then
the
thriving
villages
emptied
themselves
so
that
today
we
must
needs
again
from
scattered
traces
and
old
buildings
and
still
older
names
the
once
familiar
figures
of
the
east
anglian
clothier
and
his
swarm
of
busy
workmen
such
a
familiar
figure
was
once
old
thomas
paycocke
clothier
of
coggeshall
in
essex
who
died
full
of
years
and
honour
in
his
family
originally
came
from
clare
in
suffolk
but
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
branch
settled
at
coggeshall
a
village
not
far
distant
his
grandfather
and
father
would
seem
to
have
been
grazing
butchers
but
he
and
his
brother
and
their
descendants
after
them
followed
truly
noble
manufacture
of
and
set
an
indelible
mark
upon
the
village
where
they
dwelt
coggeshall
lies
in
the
great
district
of
essex
of
which
fuller
wrote
county
is
charactered
like
bethsheba
she
layeth
her
hand
to
the
spindle
and
her
hands
hold
the
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
pray
that
the
plough
may
go
along
and
the
wheel
around
that
so
being
fed
by
the
one
and
clothed
by
the
other
there
may
be
by
blessing
no
danger
of
starving
in
our
nation
all
over
essex
there
lay
villages
famous
for
coggeshall
and
braintree
bocking
and
halstead
shalford
and
dedham
and
above
all
colchester
the
great
centre
and
mart
of
the
trade
the
villages
throve
on
the
industry
and
there
was
hardly
a
cottage
which
did
not
hum
with
the
spinning
wheel
and
hardly
a
street
where
you
might
not
have
counted
weavers
workshops
kitchens
where
the
rough
loom
stood
by
the
wall
to
occupy
the
working
hours
hardly
a
week
but
the
clatter
of
the
would
be
heard
in
the
straggling
streets
bringing
in
new
stores
of
wool
to
be
worked
and
taking
away
the
pieces
of
cloth
to
the
clothiers
of
colchester
and
the
surrounding
villages
throughout
the
fifteenth
century
coggeshall
was
an
important
centre
second
only
to
the
great
towns
of
norwich
colchester
and
sudbury
and
to
this
day
its
two
inns
are
called
the
and
the
we
must
as
i
said
build
up
the
portrait
of
thomas
paycocke
and
his
compeers
from
scattered
traces
but
happily
such
traces
are
common
enough
in
many
and
many
an
english
village
and
in
coggeshall
itself
they
lie
ready
to
our
hand
out
of
three
things
he
can
be
brought
to
life
again
to
wit
his
house
in
the
village
street
his
family
brasses
in
the
aisle
of
the
village
church
and
his
will
which
is
preserved
at
somerset
house
a
house
a
brass
a
will
they
seem
little
enough
but
they
hold
all
his
history
it
is
the
greatest
error
to
suppose
that
history
must
needs
be
something
written
down
for
it
may
just
as
well
be
something
built
up
and
churches
houses
bridges
or
amphitheatres
can
tell
their
story
as
plainly
as
print
for
those
who
have
eyes
to
read
the
roman
villa
excavated
after
lying
lost
for
centuries
beneath
the
heel
of
the
unwitting
ploughboy
that
villa
with
its
spacious
its
floors
rich
with
mosaic
patterns
its
elaborate
heating
apparatus
and
its
shattered
vases
brings
home
more
clearly
than
any
textbook
the
real
meaning
of
the
roman
empire
whose
citizens
lived
like
this
in
a
foggy
island
at
the
uttermost
edge
of
its
world
the
norman
castle
with
moat
and
drawbridge
gatehouse
and
bailey
and
keep
arrow
slits
instead
of
windows
is
more
eloquent
than
a
hundred
chronicles
of
the
perils
of
life
in
the
twelfth
century
not
thus
dwelt
the
private
gentleman
in
the
days
of
rome
the
country
of
the
fourteenth
century
with
courtyard
and
chapel
and
hall
and
dovecote
speaks
of
an
age
of
peace
once
more
when
life
on
a
thousand
little
manors
revolved
round
the
lord
and
the
great
mass
of
englishmen
went
unscathed
by
the
hundred
years
war
which
seamed
the
fair
face
of
france
then
begin
the
merchants
elaborate
perpendicular
houses
in
the
towns
and
villages
of
the
fifteenth
century
standing
on
the
road
with
gardens
behind
them
and
carved
beams
great
and
a
general
air
of
comfort
they
mark
the
advent
of
a
new
class
in
english
history
the
middle
class
thrust
between
lord
and
peasant
and
coming
to
its
own
how
the
spacious
days
of
great
elizabeth
are
mirrored
in
the
beautiful
elizabethan
houses
with
their
wide
wings
and
large
rooms
their
chimneys
their
glass
windows
looking
outwards
on
to
open
parks
and
spreading
trees
instead
of
inwards
on
to
the
closed
courtyard
or
go
into
a
house
built
or
redecorated
in
the
eighteenth
century
where
you
will
see
chippendale
chairs
and
lacquer
tables
and
chinese
covered
with
pagodas
and
mandarins
and
surely
there
will
come
to
your
mind
the
age
of
the
nabobs
the
age
which
john
company
had
familiarized
with
the
products
of
the
far
east
the
age
in
which
tea
ousted
coffee
as
the
drink
for
a
gentleman
of
fashion
in
which
horace
walpole
collected
porcelain
oliver
goldsmith
idealized
china
in
citizen
of
the
world
and
dr
johnson
was
called
the
great
cham
of
literature
look
here
upon
this
picture
and
on
this
look
at
that
row
of
houses
a
hundred
in
a
row
and
all
exactly
alike
of
that
villa
all
roof
and
hardly
any
window
with
false
bottle
glass
in
its
panes
here
is
the
twentieth
century
for
you
indeed
all
the
social
and
very
much
of
the
political
history
of
england
may
be
reconstructed
from
her
architecture
alone
and
so
i
make
no
apology
for
calling
thomas
paycocke
house
historical
evidence
of
much
the
same
type
though
less
interesting
is
the
evidence
of
monumental
brasses
which
are
to
be
found
in
most
parts
of
england
and
which
abound
in
east
anglia
the
home
counties
and
the
thames
valley
their
variety
is
magnificent
brasses
of
ecclesiastics
in
vestments
of
doctors
of
law
and
divinity
and
masters
of
arts
in
academic
dress
and
of
a
few
abbots
and
abbesses
brasses
of
knights
in
armour
brasses
of
ladies
with
their
little
dogs
at
their
feet
and
dresses
which
show
the
changes
in
fashion
from
century
to
century
and
make
clear
all
the
mysteries
of
kirtles
and
wimples
and
partlets
and
farthingales
and
the
appropriate
to
each
successive
mode
the
brasses
also
like
the
houses
bear
witness
to
the
prosperity
of
the
middle
class
for
in
the
fourteenth
century
when
merchants
began
to
build
themselves
fine
houses
they
began
also
to
bury
themselves
under
splendid
brasses
finest
of
all
perhaps
are
the
brasses
of
the
wool
staplers
with
feet
resting
on
woolpack
or
sheep
but
there
are
many
other
merchants
too
mayors
and
aldermen
abound
they
set
their
merchants
marks
upon
their
tombs
as
proudly
as
gentlemen
set
their
coats
of
arms
and
indeed
they
had
as
great
cause
for
pride
you
may
see
them
at
their
proudest
in
the
famous
brass
at
lynn
where
robert
braunch
lies
between
his
two
wives
and
at
his
feet
is
incised
a
scene
representing
the
feast
at
which
he
entertained
edward
iii
royally
and
feasted
him
on
peacocks
there
is
a
tailor
with
his
shears
as
glorious
as
the
crusader
sword
at
northleach
and
a
wine
merchant
with
his
feet
upon
a
wine
cask
at
cirencester
there
are
smaller
folk
too
less
dowered
with
wealth
but
proud
enough
of
the
implements
of
their
craft
two
or
three
public
notaries
with
penhorn
and
pencase
complete
a
huntsman
with
his
horn
and
in
newland
church
one
of
the
free
miners
of
the
forest
of
dean
cap
and
leather
breeches
tied
below
the
knee
wooden
over
shoulder
a
small
mattock
in
his
right
hand
and
a
candlestick
between
his
teeth
this
kind
of
historical
evidence
will
help
us
with
thomas
paycocke
his
family
brasses
were
set
in
the
north
aisle
of
the
parish
church
of
st
peter
ad
vincula
several
of
them
have
disappeared
in
the
course
of
the
last
century
and
a
half
and
unluckily
no
brass
of
thomas
himself
survives
but
in
the
aisle
there
still
lie
two
the
brass
of
his
brother
john
who
died
in
and
john
wife
and
that
of
his
nephew
another
thomas
who
died
in
the
mark
may
still
be
seen
thereon
lastly
there
is
the
evidence
of
the
paycocke
wills
of
which
three
are
preserved
at
somerset
house
the
will
of
john
paycocke
thomas
father
and
the
builder
of
the
house
the
will
of
thomas
paycocke
himself
and
the
will
of
his
nephew
thomas
the
same
whose
brass
lies
in
the
aisle
and
who
left
a
long
and
splendidly
detailed
testament
full
of
information
upon
local
history
and
the
organization
of
the
cloth
industry
for
social
historians
have
as
yet
hardly
perhaps
made
as
much
use
as
they
might
of
the
evidence
of
wills
the
enormous
amount
of
miscellaneous
information
to
be
derived
therefrom
about
the
life
of
our
forefathers
can
hardly
be
believed
save
by
those
who
have
turned
the
pages
of
such
a
collection
as
the
great
in
wills
you
may
see
how
many
daughters
a
man
could
dower
and
how
many
he
put
into
a
nunnery
and
what
education
he
provided
for
his
sons
you
may
note
which
were
the
most
popular
religious
houses
and
which
men
had
books
and
what
the
books
were
how
much
of
their
money
they
thought
fit
to
leave
for
charitable
purposes
and
what
they
thought
of
the
business
capacity
of
their
wives
you
may
read
long
and
dazzling
lists
of
family
plate
all
the
favourite
cups
and
dishes
having
pet
names
of
their
own
and
of
rings
and
brooches
and
belts
and
rosaries
there
are
detailed
descriptions
of
dresses
and
furs
sometimes
splendid
sometimes
ordinary
for
people
handed
on
their
rich
clothes
as
carefully
as
their
jewels
there
are
even
more
wonderful
descriptions
of
beds
with
all
their
bedclothes
and
hangings
for
a
bed
was
a
very
valuable
article
of
furniture
and
must
often
judging
from
the
wills
have
been
a
brilliant
and
beautiful
object
indeed
shakespeare
has
earned
a
great
deal
of
unmerited
obloquy
for
leaving
ann
hathaway
his
bed
though
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
he
might
have
left
her
his
even
more
beautiful
than
dressings
and
bed
or
chamber
hangings
are
the
brocaded
and
embroidered
vestments
mentioned
in
wills
and
the
elaborate
arrangements
for
funeral
ceremonies
are
extremely
interesting
the
wills
are
of
all
kinds
there
are
even
villeins
wills
though
in
theory
the
villein
possessions
were
his
lord
and
there
are
wills
of
kings
and
queens
lords
and
ladies
bishops
and
parsons
and
lawyers
and
shopkeepers
here
also
is
more
evidence
for
the
social
prosperity
of
the
middle
class
details
of
their
trade
the
contents
of
their
shops
the
inventories
of
their
houses
their
estates
sometimes
in
the
country
their
house
rents
almost
always
in
the
town
their
dressers
garnished
with
plate
and
their
wives
ornaments
their
apprentices
and
their
gilds
their
philanthropy
their
intermarriage
with
the
gentry
their
religious
opinions
such
a
living
picture
do
men
wills
give
us
of
their
daily
lives
these
then
are
the
three
sources
from
which
the
life
and
times
of
thomas
paycocke
may
be
drawn
all
three
houses
brasses
and
wills
contain
much
evidence
for
the
increasingly
rapid
growth
during
the
last
two
centuries
of
the
middle
ages
of
a
large
and
prosperous
middle
class
whose
wealth
was
based
not
upon
landed
property
but
upon
industry
and
trade
it
is
a
class
of
whom
we
have
already
met
typical
examples
in
thomas
betson
and
the
anonymous
ménagier
de
paris
and
we
must
now
see
what
his
house
his
will
and
his
family
brasses
tell
us
about
the
clothier
thomas
paycocke
first
and
foremost
they
tell
us
a
great
deal
about
the
noble
industry
which
supported
him
house
is
full
of
relics
of
the
cloth
industry
the
merchant
mark
of
the
paycockes
an
ermine
tail
looking
like
a
clover
leaf
is
to
be
found
on
the
carved
beams
of
the
chimney
on
the
breastsummers
of
the
and
set
in
the
midst
of
the
strip
of
carving
along
the
front
of
the
house
thomas
marked
his
bales
of
cloth
thus
and
what
other
armorial
bearings
did
he
need
the
whole
house
is
essentially
middle
house
of
a
man
who
was
in
an
age
when
to
be
was
not
yet
to
be
vulgar
his
prosperity
has
blossomed
out
into
exquisitely
ornate
decoration
a
band
of
carving
runs
along
the
front
of
the
house
and
from
the
curved
stem
of
it
branch
out
a
hundred
charming
devices
leaves
tendrils
strange
flowers
human
heads
tudor
roses
a
crowned
king
and
queen
lying
hand
in
hand
a
baby
diving
with
a
kick
of
fat
legs
into
the
bowl
of
an
arum
lily
and
in
the
midst
the
merchant
mark
upon
a
shield
and
the
initials
of
the
master
of
the
house
in
the
hall
is
a
beautiful
ceiling
of
carved
oakwork
exceedingly
elaborate
and
bearing
at
intervals
the
merchant
mark
again
upstairs
in
the
big
bedchamber
is
a
ceiling
of
beams
worked
in
bold
roll
mouldings
and
there
is
an
exquisite
little
parlour
lined
with
linen
fold
panels
with
a
breastsummer
carved
with
strange
animals
this
elaboration
is
characteristic
it
is
all
of
a
piece
with
coggeshall
church
and
with
all
those
other
spacious
east
anglian
churches
lavenham
long
melford
thaxted
saffron
walden
lynn
snettisham
lofty
and
spacious
which
the
clothiers
built
out
of
their
newly
won
wealth
the
very
architecture
is
characteristic
again
like
those
who
paid
for
it
the
elaborate
ornament
and
sumptuous
detail
of
the
perpendicular
taking
the
place
of
the
simple
majesty
of
the
early
english
style
it
is
just
the
sort
of
architecture
that
a
merchant
with
a
fortune
would
pay
for
the
middle
class
liked
some
show
for
its
money
but
again
it
was
the
ostentation
without
the
vulgarity
of
wealth
looking
upon
his
beautiful
house
or
worshipping
beside
his
family
tombs
with
the
merchant
mark
on
the
brasses
in
st
katherine
aisle
thomas
paycocke
must
often
have
blessed
the
noble
industry
which
supported
him
the
wills
of
the
paycockes
tell
the
same
story
to
whom
beside
his
family
does
thomas
leave
legacies
but
the
good
folk
of
the
neighbourhood
who
worked
for
him
there
is
the
goodday

of
cheerful

with

their

nor
their

john
who
was
a

and
had
ten

all
these
gooddays
were
doubtless
bound
to
thomas

by
ties
of
work
as
well
as
of
friendship
they
belonged
to
a

for
generations
connected
with

industry
thomas

the

generation
of

can
hardly
imagine
the
immovable
stability
of
the
village
of
past
centuries
when
generation
after
generation
grew
from
cradle
to
grave
in
the
same
houses
on
the
same
cobbled
streets
and
folk
of
the

name
were
still
friends
as
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
had
been
before
them
other
friends
and
employees
of
thomas
paycocke
also
had
their
legacies

my

we
may
see
humphrey
stonor
with
sleepy
eyes
making
his
way
downstairs
on
a
frosty
morning
from
those
huge
raftered
attics
where
perhaps
the
used
to
sleep
he
was
on
terms
of
impudent
friendship
no
doubt
with
the
weavers
and
fullers
whom
his
master
set
to
work
withal
a
young
man
of
good
family
a
relative
perchance
of
those
stonors
for
whom
thomas
betson
worked
for
as
deloney
wrote
yonger
sons
of
knights
and
gentlemen
to
whom
their
fathers
would
leave
no
lands
were
most
commonly
preferred
to
learn
this
trade
to
the
end
that
thereby
they
might
live
in
good
estate
and
drive
forth
their
days
in
prosperity
two
of
his
friends
got
substantial
legacies
apparently
thomas

here
are
all
the
branches
of
the
cloth
industry
at
a
glance
it
is
thomas
paycocke
clothier
round
whom
the
whole
manufacture
revolves
he
gives
the
wool
to
the
women
to
comb
it
and
card
it
and
spin
it
he
receives
it
from
them
again
and
gives
it
to
the
weaver
to
be
woven
into
cloth
he
gives
the
cloth
to
the
fuller
to
be
fulled
and
the
dyer
to
be
dyed
and
having
received
it
when
finished
he
has
it
made
up
into
dozens
and
sends
it
off
to
the
wholesale
dealer
the
draper
who
sells
it
perhaps
he
has
been
wont
to
send
it
to
that
very
perpoint
draper
whom
he
calls
cosyn
and
makes
his
executor
the
whole
of
thomas
daily
business
is
implicit
in
his
will
in
the
year
of
his
death
he
was
still
employing
a
large
number
of
workers
and
was
on
friendly
and
benevolent
terms
with
them
the
building
of
his
house
had
not
signalized
his
retirement
from
business
as
happened
when
another
great
clothier
thomas
dolman
gave
up
and
the
weavers
of
newbury
went
about
lamenting
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
miserable
sinners
thomas
dolman
has
built
a
new
house
and
turned
away
all
his
spinners
the
relations
between
paycocke
and
his
employees
evinced
in
his
will
are
happy
ones
such
was
not
always
the
case
for
if
the
clothiers
of
this
age
had
some
of
the
virtues
of
capitalists
they
also
had
many
of
their
vices
and
the
strife
of
capital
and
labour
was
already
well
advanced
in
the
fifteenth
century
one
detail
paycocke
will
does
not
give
us
which
we
should
be
glad
to
know
did
he
employ
only
domestic
weavers
working
in
their
own
houses
or
did
he
also
keep
a
certain
number
of
looms
working
in
his
house
it
was
characteristic
of
the
period
in
which
he
lived
that
something
like
a
miniature
factory
system
was
establishing
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
new
outwork
system
the
clothiers
were
beginning
to
set
up
looms
in
their
own
houses
and
to
work
them
by
journeymen
weavers
as
a
rule
the
independent
weavers
greatly
disliked
the
practice
for
either
they
were
forced
from
the
position
of
free
masters
into
that
of
hired
servants
obliged
to
go
and
work
in
the
clothier
loom
shop
or
else
they
found
their
payment
forced
down
by
the
competition
of
the
journeymen
moreover
the
clothiers
sometimes
owned
and
let
out
looms
to
their
and
then
also
part
of
the
industrial
independence
of
the
weaver
was
lost
all
through
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
weavers
in
the
cloth
districts
kept
on
petitioning
parliament
against
this
new
evil
of
capitalism
it
was
as
though
long
before
it
established
itself
in
england
they
had
a
prevision
of
the
factory
system
and
of
the
worker
no
longer
owning
either
his
raw
material
his
tool
his
workshop
or
the
produce
of
his
industry
but
only
his
labour
the
dwindled
to
a
hired
hand
certainly
the
practice
was
growing
in
essex
where
some
twenty
years
after
thomas
paycocke
death
the
weavers
petitioned
against
the
clothiers
who
had
their
own
looms
and
weavers
and
fullers
in
their
own
houses
so
that
the
petitioners
were
rendered
destitute
the
rich
men
the
clothiers
be
concluded
and
agreed
among
themselves
to
hold
and
pay
one
price
for
weaving
the
said
cloths
a
price
too
small
to
support
their
households
even
if
they
worked
day
and
night
holiday
and
so
that
many
of
them
lost
their
independence
and
were
reduced
to
become
other
men
servants
nevertheless
the
outwork
system
remained
the
more
common
and
without
doubt
the
majority
of
workers
lived
in
their
own
cottages
though
it
is
probable
also
that
he
had
some
looms
in
his
house
perhaps
in
the
long
low
room
at
the
back
which
is
traditionally
supposed
to
have
been
used
for
weaving
perhaps
in
a
shed
or
house
a
highly
idyllic
picture
of
work
in
one
of
these
miniature
factories
which
we
may
amuse
ourselves
by
applying
to
thomas
paycocke
is
contained
in
deloney
history
of
jack
of
jack
of
newbury
was
an
historical
character
a
very
famous
clothier
named
john
winchcomb
who
died
at
newbury
only
a
year
later
than
paycocke
himself
and
of
whom
paycocke
must
certainly
have
heard
for
his
kersies
were
famous
on
the
continent
and
old
fuller
who
celebrates
him
among
his
of
calls
him
most
considerable
clothier
without
fancy
or
fiction
england
ever
beheld
the
tales
of
how
he
had
led
a
hundred
of
his
own
to
flodden
field
how
he
had
feasted
the
king
and
queen
in
his
house
at
newbury
how
he
had
built
part
of
newbury
church
and
how
he
had
refused
a
knighthood
preferring
rest
in
his
russet
coat
a
poor
clothier
to
his
dying
day
spread
about
england
growing
as
they
spread
in
thomas
deloney
the
forefather
of
the
novel
enshrined
them
in
a
rambling
tale
half
prose
and
half
verse
which
soon
became
extremely
popular
it
is
from
this
tale
that
we
may
take
an
imaginary
picture
of
work
in
a
clothier
house
being
wary
to
remember
however
that
it
is
an
exaggeration
a
legend
and
that
the
great
john
winchcomb
certainly
never
had
as
many
as
two
hundred
looms
in
his
own
house
while
our
thomas
paycocke
probably
had
not
more
than
a
dozen
but
the
poet
must
have
his
licence
for
after
all
the
spirit
of
the
ballad
is
the
thing
and
it
is
always
a
pleasant
diversion
to
drop
into
rhyme
within
one
roome
being
large
and
long
there
stood
two
hundred
loomes
full
strong
two
hundred
men
the
truth
is
so
wrought
in
these
loomes
all
in
a
row
by
every
one
a
pretty
boy
sate
making
quilts
with
mickle
joy
and
in
another
place
hard
by
a
hundred
women
merily
were
carding
hard
with
joy
full
cheere
who
singing
sate
with
voyces
cleere
and
in
a
chamber
close
beside
two
hundred
maidens
did
abide
in
petticoats
of
stammell
red
and
milk
white
kerchers
on
their
head
their
like
to
winter
snow
that
on
the
westerne
mountaines
flow
and
each
sleeve
with
a
silken
band
was
featly
tied
at
the
hand
these
pretty
maids
did
never
lin
but
in
that
place
all
day
did
spin
and
spinning
so
with
voyces
meet
like
nightingales
they
sang
full
sweet
then
to
another
roome
came
they
where
children
were
in
poore
aray
and
every
one
sate
picking
wool
the
finest
from
the
course
to
cull
the
number
was
sevenscore
and
ten
the
children
of
poore
silly
men
and
these
their
labours
to
requite
had
every
one
a
penny
at
night
beside
their
meat
and
drinke
all
day
which
was
to
them
a
wondrous
stay
within
another
place
likewise
full
fifty
proper
men
he
spies
and
these
were
sheremen
everyone
whose
skill
and
cunning
there
was
showne
and
hard
by
them
there
did
remaine
full
rowers
taking
paine
a
likewise
had
he
then
wherein
he
kept
full
forty
men
and
likewise
in
his
fulling
mill
full
twenty
persons
kept
he
still
each
weeke
ten
good
fat
oxen
he
spent
in
his
house
for
certaintie
beside
good
butter
cheese
and
fish
and
many
another
wholesome
dish
he
kept
a
butcher
all
the
yeere
a
brewer
eke
for
ale
and
beere
a
baker
for
to
bake
his
bread
which
stood
his
hushold
in
good
stead
five
cookes
within
his
kitchin
great
were
all
the
yeare
to
dress
his
meat
six
scullion
boyes
vnto
their
hands
to
make
clean
dishes
pots
and
pans
beside
poore
children
that
did
stay
to
turne
the
broaches
every
day
the
old
man
that
did
see
this
sight
was
much
amaz
as
well
he
might
this
was
a
gallant
cloathier
sure
whose
fame
forever
shall
endure
the
private
life
of
thomas
paycocke
no
less
than
his
business
can
be
made
to
live
again
of
his
family
the
invaluable
will
tells
us
a
little
his
first
wife
was
that
margaret
whose
initials
together
with
his
own
decorate
the
woodwork
of
the
house
and
indeed
it
is
probable
that
old
john
paycocke
built
the
house
for
the
young
couple
on
their
wedding
gay
indeed
must
have
been
the
sights
which
it
witnessed
on
that
happy
day
for
our
ancestors
knew
how
to
put
their
hearts
into
a
wedding
and
merry
england
was
never
merrier
then
when
the
bridegroom
led
home
the
bride
we
may
borrow
once
again
from
deloney
idyll
to
recreate
the
scene
the
bride
being
attyred
in
a
gowne
of
sheepes
russet
and
a
kertle
of
fine
woosted
her
head
attyred
with
a
billiment
of
gold
and
her
haire
as
yeallow
as
gold
hanging
downe
behinde
her
which
was
curiously
combed
and
pleated
according
to
the
manner
in
those
dayes
shee
was
led
to
church
betweene
two
sweete
boyes
with
bridelaces
and
rosemary
tied
about
their
silken
sleeves
then
was
there
a
fair
of
silver
and
gilt
carried
before
her
wherein
was
a
goodly
branch
of
rosemary
gilded
very
faire
hung
about
with
silken
ribands
of
all
colours
next
was
there
a
noyse
of
musicians
that
played
all
the
way
before
her
after
her
came
all
the
chiefest
maydens
of
the
country
some
bearing
great
bride
cakes
and
some
garlands
of
wheate
finely
gilded
and
so
she
past
unto
the
church
it
is
needlesse
for
mee
to
make
any
mention
here
of
the
bridegroome
who
being
a
man
so
well
beloued
wanted
no
company
and
those
of
the
best
sort
beside
diuers
marchant
strangers
of
the
stillyard
that
came
from
london
to
the
wedding
the
marriage
being
solemnized
home
they
came
in
order
as
before
and
to
dinner
they
went
where
was
no
want
of
good
cheare
no
lack
of
melody
the
wedding
endured
ten
dayes
to
the
great
reliefe
of
the
poore
that
dwelt
all
about
much
dancing
the
house
doubtless
saw
under
the
beautiful
carved
roof
of
the
hall
with
much
song
games
kissing
and
general
abandon
even
when
the
bride
and
groom
retired
to
the
bridal
chamber
with
its
beams
the
was
not
done
they
must
hold
a
levee
to
their
nearest
friends
in
the
bedchamber
itself
enthroned
in
the
great
bed
there
was
no
false
delicacy
about
our
ancestors
indeed
as
henry
bullinger
says
he
was
a
very
different
person
from
jovial
deloney
but
he
was
a
contemporary
of
paycocke
and
coverdale
translated
him
so
let
him
speak
supper
must
they
begynne
to
pype
and
daunce

to

what
would
we
not
give
for
one
of
those
ballads
today
the
bride
margaret
who
was
somewhat
after
this
merry
fashion
brought
home
to
coggeshall
came
from
clare
the
ancient
home
of
the
coggeshall
paycockes
she
was
the
daughter
of
one
thomas
horrold
for
whose
memory
paycocke
retained
a
lively
affection
and
respect
for
in
founding
a
chantry
in
coggeshall
church
he
desired
specially
that
it
should
be
for
the
souls
of
himself
and
his
wife
his
mother
and
father
and
his
thomas
horrold
of

also
left

without

the
only
young
folk
of

whom
thomas
ever
saw
at
play
in
his
lofty
hall
or
climbing
upon
his
dresser
to
find
the
head
as
small
as
a

also

goodday
it
was
perhaps
in
the
hope
of
a
son
to
whom
he
might
leave
his
house
and
name
that
thomas
paycocke
married
again
a
girl
called
ann
cotton
she
was
the
wife
of
his
old
age
my
good
wif

her

must
have
made
bright
the
beautiful

silent

george
cotton
is
mentioned
in
the

and
her

but
thomas

ann
enjoyed
only
a
short
term
of
married
life
she
brought
him
his

child
but
death
overtook
him
before
it

and
as
long
as
she
lives
the
beautiful
house
is
to

to

arrangements
for

he

at

pleyser
and
my
dof
house
with
the
garden
stoundeth
in
a
gap
in
the
paycocke
records
makes
it
difficult
to
say
whether
thomas
paycocke
child
lived
or
died
but
it
seems
probable
that
it
either
died
or
was
a
girl
for
paycocke
had
bequeathed
the
house
provided
that
he
had
no
male
heirs
to
his
nephew
john
son
of
his
eldest
brother
john
and
in
we
find
it
in
the
hands
of
this
john
paycocke
while
the
house
next
door
was
in
the
hands
of
another
thomas
paycocke
his
brother
robert
son
this
thomas
died
about
leaving
only
daughters
and
after
him
in
died
john
paycocke
sadly
commemorated
in
the
parish
register
as
last
of
his
name
in
coxall
so
the
beautiful
house
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
the
great
family
of
clothiers
who
had
held
it
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
of
thomas
paycocke
personal
character
it
is
also
possible
to
divine
something
from
his
will
he
was
obviously
a
kind
and
benevolent
employer
as
his
thought
for
his
and
their
children
shows
he
was
often
asked
to
stand
godfather
to
the
babies
of
coggeshall
for
in
his
will
he
directs
that
at
his
burial
and
the
ceremonies
which
were
repeated
on
the
seventh
day
and
mind
after
it
there
were
to
be
or
xij
smale

with

in

and
as

lett

iiij

and
also
euery

chyld
besyde
vj
viij

all
these
children
were
probably
little
employed
at
a
very
early
age
in
sorting
thomas
paycocke
wool
people
says
thomas
deloney
god
lightly
blessed
with
most
children
did
by
meanes
of
this
occupation
so
order
them
that
by
the
time
they
were
come
to
be
sixe
or
seven
yeeres
of
age
they
were
able
to
get
their
owne
bread
and
when
defoe
rode
from
blackstone
edge
to
halifax
observing
the
cloth
manufacture
which
occupied
all
the
villages
of
the
west
riding
it
was
one
of
his
chief
grounds
for
admiration
that
were
employed
from
the
youngest
to
the
oldest
scarce
any
thing
above
four
years
old
but
its
hands
were
sufficient
for
its
own
support
the
employment
of
children
at
what
we
should
regard
as
an
excessively
early
age
was
by
no
means
a
new
phenomenon
introduced
with
the
industrial
revolution
that
thomas
paycocke
had
many
friends
not
only
in
coggeshall
but
in
the
villages
round
the
number
of
his
legacies
bears
witness
his
will
also
shows
that
he
was
a
man
of
deep
religious
feeling
he
was
a
brother
of
the
crutched
friars
of
colchester
and
left
them
on
his
death
five
pounds
to
pray
me
and
for
them
that
i
am
bound
to
pray
fore
it
was
customary
in
the
middle
ages
for
monastic
houses
to
give
the
privilege
of
the
fraternity
of
the
house
to
benefactors
and
persons
of
distinction
the
reception
took
place
at
a
long
and
elaborate
ceremony
during
which
the
received
the
kiss
of
peace
from
all
the
brethren
it
is
a
mark
of
the
respect
in
which
thomas
paycocke
was
held
in
the
countryside
that
he
should
have
been
made
a
brother
by
the
crutched
friars
he
seems
to
have
had
a
special
kindness
for
the
order
of
friars
he
left
the
grey
friars
of
colchester
and
the
friars
of
maldon
chelmsford
and
sudbury
each
ten
shillings
for
a
trental
and
to
repair
their
houses
and
to
the
friars
of
clare
he
left
twenty
shillings
for
two
trentals
at
lent
after
my
deceste
a
kade
of
red
heryng
he
had
great
interest
in
coggeshall
abbey
it
lay
less
than
a
mile
from
his
house
and
he
must
often
have
dined
in
state
with
the
abbot
at
his
guest
table
on
feast
days
and
attended
mass
in
the
abbey
church
he
remembered
the
abbey
as
he
lay
dying
and
the
sound
of
its
bells
ringing
for
vespers
came
softly
in
at
his
window
on
the
mellow
september
air
and
he
left
lord
abbot
and
convent
one
of
his
famous
broadcloths
and
four
pounds
in
money
to
have
a
dirige

his
piety
is
shown
also
in
his
bequests
to
the
churches

adjacent
to
coggeshall

to

st
pauls
over
the
essex
order
in
the
district
from
which
the
paycockes
originally
came
but
his
greatest
care
was
naturally
for
coggeshall
church
one
of
the
paycockes
had
probably
built
the
north
aisle
where
the
altar
was
dedicated
to
st

all

tombs
lay
there
thomas

of
piety
and
of

pride
these
legacies
to
religious
houses
and
to
churches
speak
clearly
another
series
of
legacies
which
takes
a
form
characteristic
of
medieval
charity
bears
witness
perhaps
to
thomas
paycocke
habits
he
must
often
have
ridden
abroad
to
see
the
folk
who
worked
for
him
or
to
visit
his
friends
in
the
villages
round
coggeshall
or
farther
afield
to
clare
first
to
see
the
home
of
his
ancestors
then
to
court
margaret
horrold
his
bride
and
then
with
margaret
beside
him
to
visit
his
certainly
whether
he
walked
to
church
in
coggeshall
or
whether
he
rode
along
the
country
lanes
he
often
sighed
over
the
state
of
the
road
as
he
went
often
he
must
have
struggled
through
torrents
of
mud
in
winter
or
stumbled
among
holes
in
summer
for
in
the
middle
ages
the
care
of
the
roads
was
a
matter
for
private
or
ecclesiastical
charity
and
all
except
the
great
highways
were
likely
to
be
but
indifferently
kept
langland
in
his
mentions
the
amending
of
wayes
by
which
he
means
not
bad
habits
but
bad
roads
as
one
of
those
works
of
charity
which
rich
merchants
must
do
for
the
salvation
of
their
souls
thomas
choice
of
roads
no
doubt
reflects
many
a
wearisome
journey
from
which
he
returned
home
splashed
and
testy
to
the
ministrations
of
reyner
my
man
or
briggs
my
servant
and
of
margaret
looking
anxiously
from
her
oriel
window
for
his
return
in
his
own
town
he
leaves
no
less
than
forty
pounds
of
which
twenty
pounds
was
to
go
to
amend
a
section
of
west
street
where
his
house
stood
and
the
other
twenty
was
be
layde
on
the
fowle
wayes
bitwene
coxhall
and
blackwater
where
as
moost
nede
ys
he
had
doubtless
experienced
the
evils
of
this
road
on
his
way
to
the
abbey
farther
afield
he
leaves
twenty
pounds
for
the
way
between
clare
and
ovington
and
another
twenty
for
the
road
between
ovington
and
beauchamp
st
pauls
as
his
life
drew
to
its
close
he
doubtless
rode
less
often
afield
the
days
would
pass
peacefully
for
him
his
business
flourished
and
he
was
everywhere
loved
and
respected
he
took
pride
in
his
lovely
house
adding
bit
by
bit
to
its
beauties
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
he
must
often
have
stood
outside
the
garden
room
and
seen
the
monks
from
the
big
abbey
fishing
in
their
stewpond
across
the
field
or
lifted
his
eyes
to
where
the
last
rays
of
sun
slanted
on
to
the
lichened
roof
of
the
great
tithebarn
and
on
to
the
rows
of
tenants
carrying
their
sheaves
of
corn
along
the
road
and
he
reflected
perhaps
that
john
mann
and
thomas
spooner
his
own
tenants
were
good
steady
friends
and
that
it
was
well
to
leave
them
a
gown
or
a
pound
when
he
died
often
also
in
his
last
year
or
two
he
must
have
sat
with
his
wife
in
his
garden
with
the
and
watched
the
white
pigeons
circling
round
the
and
smiled
upon
her
bed
of
flowers
and
in
winter
evenings
sometimes
he
would
take
his
furred
cloak
and
stroll
to
the
dragon
inn
and
edward
aylward
mine
host
would
welcome
him
with
bows
and
so
he
would
sit
and
drink
a
tankard
of
sack
with
his
neighbours
very
slow
and
dignified
as
befitted
the
greatest
clothier
of
the
town
and
looking
benevolently
upon
the
company
but
at
times
he
would
frown
if
he
saw
a
truant
monk
from
the
abbey
stolen
out
for
a
drink
in
spite
of
all
the
prohibitions
of
bishop
and
abbot
shaking
his
head
perhaps
and
complaining
that
religion
was
not
what
it
had
been
in
the
good
old
days
but
not
meaning
much
of
it
as
his
will
shows
and
never
dreaming
that
twenty
years
after
his
death
abbot
and
monks
would
be
scattered
and
the
servants
would
be
selling
at
auction
the
lead
from
off
the
roof
of
coggeshall
abbey
never
dreaming
that
after
four
hundred
years
his
house
would
still
stand
mellow
and
lovely
with
its
carved
ceiling
and
its
proud
merchant
mark
when
the
abbey
church
was
only
a
shadow
on
the
surface
of
a
field
in
hot
weather
and
all
the
abbey
buildings
were
shrunk
to
one
ruined
ambulatory
ignobly
sheltering
blue
essex
hay
wagons
from
the
rain
so
thomas
paycocke
days
drew
to
a
close
amid
the
peace
and
beauty
of
the
most
english
of
counties
frutefull
and
full
of
profitable
thinges
whose
little
rolling
hills
wych
elms
and
huge
clouded
skies
constable
loved
to
paint
there
came
a
day
in
september
when
gloom
hung
over
the
streets
of
coggeshall
when
the
were
silent
in
the
cottages
and
spinners
and
weavers
stood
in
anxious
groups
outside
the
beautiful
house
in
west
street
for
upstairs
in
his
bridal
chamber
under
its
noble
ceiling
the
great
clothier
lay
dying
and
his
wife
wept
by
his
bedside
knowing
that
he
would
never
see
his
child
a
few
days
later
the
cottages
were
deserted
again
and
a
concourse
of
weeping
people
followed
thomas
paycocke
to
his
last
rest
the
ceremony
of
his
burial
befitted
his
dignity
it
comprised
services
not
only
on
burial
day
itself
but
on
the
seventh
day
after
it
and
then
again

a
month
had

thomas
paycocke
belonged
to
the
good
old
days
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
his
death
essex
was
already
changing
the
monks
were
scattered
from

stood

the

tongue
no

echoed
in

prayed
there
for
the
souls
of
thomas
and
his
wife
and
his
parents
and
his
even
the
cloth
industry
was
changing
and
the
county
was
growing
more
prosperous
still
with
the
advent
of
finer
kinds
of
cloth
brought
over
there
by

coggeshall
was
destined
to
become
more
famous
still
for
a
new
sort
of
cloth
called
whites
which
thomas
paycocke
nephews
made
when
he
was
in
his
grave
one
thing
however
did
not
change

bringing

let
me
persuade
you
to
pass
another
hour
in
my
company
it
was
the
depth
of
night
and
the
heavens
were
full
of
storm
and
i
already
weary
and
half
asleep
had
come
to
an
end
of
my
writing
when
suddenly
a
burst
of
shouts
from
the
sailors
penetrated
my
ear
aware
of
what
these
shouts
should
mean
from
former
experience
i
rose
hastily
and
went
up
to
the
higher
windows
of
this
house
which
look
out
upon
the
port
oh
what
a
spectacle
mingled
with
feelings
of
pity
of
wonder
of
fear
and
of
delight
resting
on
their
anchors
close
to
the
marble
banks
which
serve
as
a
mole
to
the
vast
palace
which
this
free
and
liberal
city
has
conceded
to
me
for
my
dwelling
several
vessels
have
passed
the
winter
exceeding
with
the
height
of
their
masts
and
spars
the
two
towers
which
flank
my
house
the
larger
of
the
two
was
at
this
moment
though
the
stars
were
all
hidden
by
the
clouds

winds
shaking
the
walls

roar
of
the
sea
filling
the
air

setting

upon
its
voyage

have
been
stupefied
with
wonder
and
tiphys
seated
at

helm
would
have
been
ashamed
of
the
nothing
which
won
him
so
much
fame
if
you
had
seen
it
you
would
have
said
it
was
no
ship
but
a
mountain
swimming
upon
the
sea
although
under
the
weight
of
its
immense
wings
a
great
part
of
it
was
hidden
in
the
waves
the
end
of
the
voyage
was
to
be
the
don
beyond
which
nothing
can
navigate
from
our
seas
but
many
of
those
who
were
on
board
when
they
had
reached

point

also

more

that

that

idea

having
probably
come
from

these

on
the

even
deadlier

were
very
popular

the
best

in

and
is
taken
from
the

a
author
the
sections
on
the
deadly
sins
are
usually
however
well
worth
reading
because
of
the
vivid
illustrative
details
which
they
often
give
about
daily
life
the
ménagier
sections
are
full
of
vigour
and
colour
as
one
would
expect
here
for
instance
is
his
description
of
the
female
glutton
commands
fasting
and
the
glutton
says
i
will
eat
god
commands
us
to
get
up
early
and
go

the
glutton
says
i

the

will

says

certes

she
becomes

where
his
disciples
go
to

upright

well

wise

sensible

well
advised

when
they
return
they
can
not

themselves

they
are

foolish

all
mad
and
they
return
swearing
beating
and
giving
the
lie
to
each

pp
the
section
on

is
particularly
valuable
for
its
picture
of
the
sins
of
executors
of
wills
lords
extortionate
shopkeepers
false

usurers
and
see
i

and
is
worth
reading
once
either

of
its
great
popularity
in

occasional
vivid

these

remarks
that
which
is
mentioned
in
the
thirteenth
century
by
rutebeuf
was
played
seated
with
a
little
stick
is
probably
the
modern
game
called
by
the
french
chaude
pince
merille
which
is
mentioned
among
the
games
of
gargantua
was
a
game
in
which
you
pinched
one
of
the
players
arms
crying
or
though
the
details
of
these
games
are
vague
there
are
many
analagous
games
played
by
children
today
and
it
is
easy
to
guess
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
meant
i
pp
i
the
story
of
jeanne

is
reproduced
in
the
of
margaret
of
navarre
the
tale
or
the
of
the
day
where
it
is
attributed
to
a
of
tours
but
it
is
probable
that
the
ménagier
is
the
original
version
since
he
says
that
he
had
it
from
his
father
although
knowing
the
ways
of
the
professional
raconteur
i
should
be
the
first
to
admit
that
this
is
not
proof
positive
i
pp
i
this
was
a
favourite
saying
it
occurs
in
the

the
ménagier
also
warns
against
running
up
long
bills
on
credit
your
folk
to
deal
with
peaceable
people
and
to
bargain
always
beforehand
and
to
account
and
pay
often
without
running
up
long
bills
on
credit
by
tally
or
on
paper
although
tally
or
paper
are
better
than
doing
everything
by
memory
for
the
creditors
always
think
it
more
and
the
debtors
less
and
thus
are
born
arguments
hatreds
and
reproaches
and
cause
your
good
creditors
to
be
paid
willingly
and
frequently
what
is
owed
to
them
and
keep
them
in
friendship
so
that
they
depart
not
from
you
for
one
can
not
always
get
peaceable
folk
again
ii
pp
it
is
curious
here
to
note
the
antiquity
of
the
term
as
an
expletive
the
ménagier
says
them
to
use
ugly
oaths
or
words
which
are
bad
or
indecent
as
do
certain
evil

bred

they

should

know
it
not

it

abominable

the
identification

book
written
early
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
now
preserved

the

oxford
no
the
artist
gives
an
admirable
view
of
medieval
venice
with
the
piazetta
to
the
left
and
the
polos
embarking
on
a
rowing
boat
to
go
on
board
their
ship
in
the
foreground
are
depicted
after
the
medieval
fashion
of
showing
several
scenes
of
a
story
in
the
same
picture
some
of
the
strange
lands
through
which
they
passed

plate
iii
of
a
landscape
roll
by
chao
this
very
beautiful
scene
is
taken
from
a
roll
painted
by
chao
in
in
the
style
of
wang
wei
a
poet
and
artist
of
the
dynasty
a
fine
description
of
it
is
given
by
mr
laurence
binyon
the
british
museum
collection
is
a
long
roll
over
seventeen
feet
long
painted
almost
entirely
in
blues
and
greens
on
the
usual
warm
brown
silk
it
is
one
continuous
landscape
in
which
the
scenes
melt
into
one
another
such
rolls
are
not
meant
to
be
exhibited
or
looked
at
all
at
once
but
enjoyed
in
small
portions
at
a
time
as
the
painting
is
slowly
unrolled
and
the
part
already
seen
rolled
up
again
no
small
mastery
is
requisite
as
may
be
imagined
to
contrive
that
wherever
the
spectator
pauses
an
harmonious
composition
is
presented
one
has
the
sensation
as
the
roll
unfolds
of
passing
through
a
delectable
country
in
the
foreground
water
winds
narrowing
and
expanding
among
verdant
knolls
and
lawns
joined
here
and
there
by
little
wooden
bridges
and
the
water
is
fed
by
torrents
that
plunge
down
among
from
crags
of
fantastic
form
glowing
with
hues
of
and
jade
under
towering
peaks
are
luxuriant
valleys
groves
with
glimpses
of
scattered
deer
walled
parks
clumps
of
delicate
bamboo
and
the
distant
roofs
of
some
nestling
village
here
and
there
is
a
pavilion
by
the
water
in
which
poet
or
sage
sits
contemplating
the
beauty
round
him
these
happy
and
romantic
scenes
yield
at
last
to
promontory
and
on
the
borders
of
a
bay
where
a
fisherman
boat
is
rocking
on
the
swell
it
is
possible
that
a
philosophic
idea
is
intended
to
be
suggested
the
passage
of
the
soul
through
the
pleasant
delights
of
earth
to
the
contemplation
of
the
infinite
laurence
binyon
in
the
far
pp
the
section
of
the
roll
which
has
been
chosen
for
reproduction
here
has
already
been
reproduced
in

it

described
lake
with
a
terraced
pavilion
on
an
island
towards
which
a
visitor
is
being
ferried
in
a
boat
while
fishermen
are
seen
in
another
boat
pulling
in
their
the
distant
mountains
the
hills
in
the
foreground
the
clump
of
willow
opposite
and
the
line
of
reeds
swaying
in
the
wind
along
the
bank
of
the
water
are
delightfully
rendered
and
skilfully
combined
to
make
a
characteristic
picture
ii
other
sections
of
the
same
roll
are
reproduced
in
giles
to
the
hist
of
chinese
pictorial
facing
and
in
binyon
plate
iii
facing
it
is
exceedingly
interesting
to
compare
this
landscape
roll
with
the
ms
of
marco
polo
illuminated
about
a
century
later
from
which
the
scene
of
the
embarkation
at
venice
has
been
taken
the
one
is
so
obviously
the
work
of
a
highly
developed
and
the
other
of
an
almost
naïve
and
childish
civilization
