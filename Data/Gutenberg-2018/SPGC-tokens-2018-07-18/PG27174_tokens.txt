legacy
queer
is
it
jim
said
rather
said
wally
they
were
sitting
on
little
green
chairs
in
hyde
park
not
far
off
swirled
the
traffic
of
piccadilly
glancing
across
to
hyde
park
corner
they
could
see
the
great
red
meeting
halting
and
then
rocking
away
in
different
directions
hooting
as
they
fled
the
roar
of
london
was
in
their
ears
it
was
a
sunny
morning
in
september
the
park
was
dotted
in
every
direction
with
shining
perambulators
propelled
by
smart
nurses
in
uniform
and
tenanted
by
proud
little
people
and
rosy
and
extremely
cheerful
wally
liked
the
park
babies
he
referred
to
them
collectively
as
young
dukes
they
all
look
so
jolly
well
tubbed
do
they
he
remarked
straying
from
the
subject
in
hand
might
be
soap
advertisements
look
there
a
jolly
little
duke
in
that
gorgeous
white
pram
and
a
bigger
sized
duke
trotting
alongside
with
a
as
big
as
himself
awful
nice
kids
he
smiled
at
the
babies
in
the
way
that
made
it
seem
ridiculous
that
he
should
be
and
in
uniform
they
ca
both
be
dukes
said
jim
literally
ca
grow
more
than
one
in
a
family
at
least
not
at
the
same
time
i
believe
oh
well
it
does
matter
and
anyhow
the
one
in
the
pram
a
duchess
returned
wally
i
say
the
duke
fallen
in
love
with
you
jim
the
duke
a
person
in
a
white
coat
hesitated
on
the
footpath
near
the
two
subalterns
then
mustering
his
courage
came
close
to
jim
and
gravely
presented
him
with
his
jim
received
the
gift
as
gravely
and
shook
hands
with
the
small
boy
to
his
great
delight
thanks
awfully
he
said
it
a
splendid
teddy
is
it
the
nurse
greatly
scandalized
swooped
down
upon
her
charge
exhorting
him
to
be
ashamed
now
and
not
worry
the
gentleman
but
the
duke
showed
such
distress
when
jim
attempted
to
return
the
that
the
matter
had
to
be
adjusted
by
distracting
his
attention
in
the
direction
of
some
drilling
soldiers
while
wally
concealed
the
toy
under
the
embroidered
rug
which
protected
the
plump
legs
of
the
duchess
who
submitted
with
delighted
gurgles
to
being
tickled
under
the
chin
they
withdrew
reluctantly
urged
by
the
still
horrified
nurse
see
what
it
is
to
be
beautiful
and
have
the
glad
eye
jeered
wally
dukes
never
give
it
my
look
of
benevolent
age
jim
said
grinning
anyhow
young
wally
if
you
stop
beguiling
the
infant
peerage
and
attend
to
business
i
be
glad
we
have
norah
and
dad
here
presently
i
all
attention
said
his
friend
but
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
than
that
it
rum
is
there
and
we
said
that
norah
gave
me
a
letter
from
poor
old
to
show
you
jim
said
i
read
it
if
you
like
the
merriment
that
was
never
very
far
from
wally
meadows
eyes
died
out
as
his
chum
unfolded
a
sheet
of
paper
closely
written
he
wrote
it
in
the
hotel
in
carrignarone
i
suppose
he
asked
gently
yes
just
after
dinner
on
the
night
of
the
fight
you
see
he
was
certain
he
was
coming
back
anyhow
this
is
what
he
says
my
dear
norah
if
i
am
alive
after
you
will
not
get
this
letter
it
is
only
to
come
to
you
if
i
shall
have
west
and
please
worry
if
i
do
go
west
you
see
between
you
all
you
have
managed
almost
to
make
me
forget
that
i
am
just
an
apology
for
a
man
i
did
not
think
it
could
be
done
but
you
have
done
it
still
now
and
then
i
remember
and
i
know
that
there
will
be
long
years
after
you
have
all
gone
back
to
that
beloved
australia
of
yours
when
there
will
be
nothing
to
keep
me
from
realizing
that
i
am
crippled
and
a
hunchback
i
have
the
one
chance
of
my
life
of
living
up
to
the
traditions
of
who
were
fighting
men
so
if
by
good
luck
i
manage
to
wing
a
german
or
two
and
then
get
in
the
way
of
an
odd
bullet
myself
you
must
grudge
my
finishing
so
much
more
pleasantly
than
i
had
ever
hoped
to
do
if
i
do
fall
i
am
leaving
you
that
place
of
mine
in
surrey
i
have
hardly
any
one
belonging
to
me
and
they
have
all
more
money
than
is
good
for
them
the
family
estates
are
entailed
but
this
is
mine
to
do
as
i
please
with
i
know
you
do
need
it
but
it
will
be
a
home
for
you
and
your
father
while
jim
and
wally
are
fighting
if
you
care
for
it
and
perhaps
you
will
make
some
use
of
it
that
will
interest
you
i
liked
the
place
as
well
as
i
could
like
any
place
outside
ireland
and
if
i
can
look
back
and
i
am
very
sure
that
i
shall
be
able
to
look
back
i
shall
like
to
see
you
all
there
you
people
who
brought
the
sun
and
light
and
laughter
of
australia
into
the
grey
shadows
of
my
life
who
never
seemed
to
see
that
i
was
different
from
other
men
well
and
god
keep
you
happy
little
mate
your
friend
john
jim
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
there
was
a
long
silence
each
boy
was
seeing
again
a
strip
of
irish
beach
where
a
brave
man
had
died
proudly
different
wall
said
at
last
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
he
was
different
at
least
only
in
being
a
jolly
sight
better
than
most
fellows
jim
nodded
well
he
had
his
fight
and
he
did
his
bit
and
seeing
how
he
felt
about
things
i
glad
for
his
sake
that
he
went
out
he
said
only
i
sorry
for
us
because
it
was
a
pretty
big
thing
to
be
friends
with
a
man
like
that
anyhow
we
wo
forget
him
we
would
even
without
this
astonishing
legacy
of
norah
have
you
any
particulars
about
it
wally
asked
dad
got
a
letter
from
too
both
were
sent
to
his
lawyers
he
must
have
posted
them
himself
that
evening
in
carrignarone
dad
was
only
business
the
place
is
really
left
to
him
in
trust
for
norah
until
she
comes
of
age
that
so
that
there
would
be
any
legal
bother
about
her
taking
possession
of
it
at
once
if
she
wants
to
poor
old
norah
just
about
bowled
over
she
felt
death
so
awfully
and
now
this
has
brought
it
all
back
yes
it
rough
on
norah
wally
said
i
expect
she
hates
taking
the
place
she
ca
bear
the
idea
of
it
dad
and
i
do
much
care
about
it
either
wally
pondered
may
i
see
that
letter
again
he
asked
presently
jim
linton
took
out
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
his
friend
he
filled
his
pipe
leisurely
and
lit
it
while
wally
knitted
his
brows
over
the
sheet
of
cheap
hotel
paper
presently
he
looked
up
a
flash
of
eagerness
in
his
keen
brown
eyes
well
i
think
left
that
place
to
norah
with
a
purpose
he
said
i
do
believe
it
just
an
ordinary
legacy
of
course
hers
all
right
but
do
you
think
he
wanted
something
done
with
it
done
with
it
yes
look
here
wally
put
a
thin
forefinger
on
the
letter
look
what
he
says
you
will
make
some
use
of
it
that
may
interest
you
do
you
think
that
means
something
i
believe
it
might
jim
said
cautiously
but
what
wally
hesitated
well
he
was
just
mad
keen
on
the
war
he
said
he
was
always
planning
what
he
could
do
to
help
since
he
could
fight
at
least
since
he
thought
he
could
the
boy
added
with
a
sigh
i
wonder
he
had
used
it
himself
for
something
in
connexion
with
the
war
he
could
it
let
jim
put
in
quickly
the
lawyers
wrote
about
it
to
dad
it
been
let
for
a
year
and
the
lease
expires
this
month
they
said
had
refused
to
renew
it
that
rather
looks
as
if
he
had
meant
to
do
something
with
it
does
it
wally
nodded
vigorously
i
bet
he
did
now
he
left
it
to
norah
to
carry
on
you
see
they
told
us
his
own
relations
were
up
to
much
i
expect
he
knew
they
would
make
any
use
of
it
except
for
themselves
why
it
as
clear
as
mud
jim
knew
that
norah
did
actually
need
the
place
and
that
she
and
your
father
wanted
to
be
near
you
and
still
help
the
war
themselves
they
did
like
working
in
london
too
much
of
a
kid
and
your
father
says
himself
he
not
trained
now
they
got
a
perfectly
ripping
chance
oh
bless
you
wally
said
a
thankful
voice
behind
them
the
boys
sprang
to
their
feet
behind
them
stood
a
tall
girl
with
a
face
and
straight
grey
eyes
eyes
that
bore
marks
of
tears
of
which
norah
for
once
was
unashamed
her
brown
curls
were
tied
back
with
a
broad
black
ribbon
she
was
very
slender
skinny
norah
would
have
said
but
despite
that
she
was
at
what
is
known
as
the
awkward
age
no
movement
of
norah
linton
was
ever
awkward
she
moved
with
something
of
the
unconcerned
grace
of
a
deer
in
her
blue
serge
coat
and
skirt
she
presented
the
look
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
her
she
smiled
at
the
two
boys
a
little
tremulously
hallo
said
her
brother
we
did
hear
you
where
did
you
spring
from
dad
dropped
me
at
the
corner
he
had
to
go
on
to
harrods
norah
answered
i
came
across
the
grass
and
you
two
were
so
busy
talking
you
did
know
i
was
there
i
could
help
hearing
what
you
said
wally
well
i
glad
you
did
wally
answered
but
what
do
you
think
yourself
nor
i
was
just
miserable
until
i
heard
you
norah
said
it
seemed
too
awful
to
take
sir
john
house
to
profit
by
his
death
i
bear
it
but
of
course
you
right
i
do
think
i
was
stupid
i
read
his
letter
a
dozen
times
but
i
never
saw
it
that
way
but
you
agree
with
wally
now
jim
asked
why
of
course
do
you
i
suppose
i
might
have
had
the
sense
to
see
his
meaning
in
time
but
i
could
only
think
of
seeming
to
benefit
by
his
death
however
as
long
as
one
member
of
the
family
has
seen
it
it
all
right
she
flashed
a
smile
at
wally
i
just
ever
so
much
happier
it
makes
it
all
different
we
were
such
her
voice
trembled
such
good
chums
and
now
it
seems
as
if
he
had
really
trusted
us
to
carry
on
for
him
of
course
he
did
wally
said
he
knew
jolly
well
you
would
make
good
use
of
it
and
it
would
help
you
too
when
jim
was
away
jim
said
that
gentleman
jim
what
are
you
leaving
yourself
out
for
are
you
coming
got
a
staff
job
at
home
i
ashamed
of
you
wally
said
norah
severely
of
course
if
you
do
to
belong
whereat
wally
meadows
flushed
and
laughed
and
muttered
something
unintelligible
that
nevertheless
was
quite
sufficient
for
his
friends
it
was
not
a
thing
of
yesterday
that
friendship
it
went
back
to
days
of
when
wally
a
lonely
orphan
from
queensland
had
been
jim
linton
chum
at
the
melbourne
grammar
school
and
had
fallen
into
a
habit
of
spending
his
holidays
at
the
linton
big
station
in
the
north
of
victoria
until
it
seemed
that
he
was
really
one
of
the
billabong
family
years
had
knitted
him
and
jim
and
norah
into
a
firm
triumvirate
mates
in
the
work
and
play
of
an
australian
watched
over
by
the
silent
grey
man
whose
existence
centred
in
his
motherless
son
and
daughter
with
a
warm
corner
in
his
affections
for
the
lithe
merry
queensland
boy
whose
loyalty
to
billabong
and
its
people
had
never
wavered
since
his
childhood
then
just
as
jim
had
outgrown
school
and
was
becoming
his
man
on
the
station
came
the
of
the
european
war
which
had
whisked
them
all
to
england
business
had
at
the
moment
summoned
linton
to
london
to
leave
norah
behind
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
as
both
the
boys
were
wild
to
enlist
and
wally
was
too
young
to
be
accepted
in
australia
though
not
in
england
it
seemed
that
the
simplest
thing
to
do
was
to
make
the
pilgrimage
a
general
one
and
let
the
chums
enlist
in
london
they
had
joined
a
famous
british
regiment
obtaining
commissions
without
difficulty
thanks
to
cadet
training
in
australia
but
their
first
experience
of
war
in
flanders
had
been
a
short
one
they
were
amongst
the
first
to
suffer
from
the
german
and
a
long
furlough
had
resulted
linton
and
norah
had
taken
them
to
ireland
as
soon
as
they
were
fit
to
travel
and
the
bogs
and
moors
of
donegal
coupled
with
had
gone
far
to
effect
a
cure
but
there
unexpected
adventure
had
awaited
them
they
had
made
friends
with
sir
john
the
last
of
an
old
north
of
ireland
family
a
man
eating
out
his
heart
against
the
fate
that
held
him
back
from
an
active
part
in
the
war
together
they
had
managed
to
stumble
on
an
for
german
submarines
concealed
on
the
rocky
coast
and
luck
and
boldness
favouring
them
to
trap
a
and
her
crew
it
had
been
a
short
and
triumphant
campaign
skilfully
engineered
by
and
he
alone
had
paid
for
the
triumph
with
his
life
john
had
died
happily
rejoicing
in
for
once
having
played
the
part
of
a
fighting
man
but
to
the
australians
his
death
had
been
a
blow
that
robbed
their
victory
of
all
its
joy
they
mourned
for
him
as
for
one
of
themselves
cherishing
the
memory
of
the
man
whose
spirit
had
outstripped
his
weak
body
jim
and
wally
from
exposure
on
the
night
of
the
fight
had
suffered
a
relapse
and
had
caused
their
to
be
extended
several
times
now
once
more
fit
they
were
back
in
london
expecting
to
rejoin
their
regiment
immediately
so
now
jim
said
the
only
question
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
going
to
think
hard
for
a
day
said
norah
so
can
you
two
and
we
ask
dad
of
course
and
then
dad
will
tell
you
what
to
do
said
jim
grinning
yes
of
course
he
will
dad
always
has
splendid
ideas
said
norah
laughing
but
we
wo
have
any
decision
for
a
day
because
it
a
terribly
big
thing
to
think
of
i
wish
i
was
grown
up
it
must
be
easier
to
settle
big
questions
if
you
have
got
your
hair
down
your
back
i
do
quite
see
what
your
old
curly
mop
has
to
do
with
it
but
anyhow
you
need
be
in
a
hurry
to
put
it
up
said
her
brother
it
awful
to
be
old
and
responsible
is
it
wally
to
which
wally
responded
with
feeling
beastly
and
endeavoured
to
look
more
than
nineteen
failing
signally
let
go
and
look
at
the
row
norah
said
dad
will
find
us
all
right
i
suppose
jim
hesitated
why
he
could
miss
you
said
norah
laughing
come
on
even
when
more
than
a
year
of
war
had
made
uniform
a
commonplace
in
london
streets
you
might
have
turned
to
look
at
jim
and
wally
jim
was
immensely
tall
his
chum
little
less
so
and
both
were
lean
and
tanned
to
a
deep
bronze
and
stamped
with
a
look
of
resolute
keenness
in
their
eyes
was
the
deep
glint
that
comes
to
those
who
have
habitually
looked
across
great
spaces
the
type
has
become
familiar
enough
in
london
now
but
it
generally
exists
under
a
slouch
hat
and
these
lads
were
in
british
uniform
bearing
the
badges
of
a
famous
marching
regiment
at
first
they
had
hankered
after
the
cavalry
being
much
more
accustomed
to
ride
than
to
walk
but
as
the
armies
settled
down
into
the
flanders
mud
it
became
increasingly
apparent
that
this
was
not
to
be
a
horseman
war
and
that
therefore
as
wally
put
it
if
they
wanted
to
be
in
the
fun
they
had
better
make
up
their
minds
to
paddle
with
the
rest
the
amount
of
fun
had
so
far
been
a
negligible
quantity
which
caused
them
some
bitterness
of
spirit
they
earnestly
hoped
to
increase
it
as
speedily
as
might
be
and
to
give
the
hun
as
much
inconvenience
as
they
could
manage
in
the
process
they
strolled
across
the
grass
to
the
railings
and
looked
up
and
down
the
tan
ribbon
of
rotten
row
small
boys
and
girls
on
smart
ponies
and
woolly
shetlands
walked
or
trotted
sedately
or
occasionally
galloped
followed
by
elderly
grooms
torn
between
pride
and
anxiety
jim
and
wally
thought
the
famous
row
an
concern
failing
to
realize
from
its
war
aspect
the
row
of
other
days
crammed
from
fence
to
fence
with
beautiful
horses
and
riders
and
with
half
the
world
looking
on
from
the
railings
nowadays
the
small
boys
and
girls
had
it
chiefly
to
themselves
and
could
stray
from
side
to
side
at
their
own
sweet
will
a
few
ladies
were
riding
and
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
officers
in
khaki
obviously
on
army
horses
and
out
for
exercise
now
and
then
came
a
wounded
man
slowly
on
a
reliable
cob
or
sturdy
pony
bandages
visible
or
one
arm
in
a
sling
a
few
people
sat
about
or
leaned
on
the
fences
watching
but
there
was
nothing
to
attract
a
crowd
every
one
looked
purposeful
clothes
were
plain
and
useful
with
little
frippery
the
old
glitter
and
splendour
of
the
row
was
gone
the
london
that
used
to
watch
it
was
a
london
that
had
forgotten
how
to
play
beyond
the
row
carriages
drawn
by
beautiful
pairs
of
horses
with
harness
flashing
in
the
sunlight
drove
up
and
down
some
contained
old
ladies
and
men
but
nearly
all
bore
a
load
of
wounded
soldiers
with
sometimes
a
nurse
there
that
nice
old
lady
ellison
the
one
that
used
to
take
jim
and
me
out
when
we
were
in
hospital
wally
said
indicating
a
carriage
with
a
magnificent
pair
of
bays
she
was
an
old
dear
my
word
like
to
have
the
driving
of
those
horses
in
a
good
light
buggy
on
the
billabong
track
so
would
i
jim
assented
but
i
take
those
beastly
off
before
i
started
yes
said
norah
eagerly
poor
darlings
how
they
must
hate
them
jim
i
wish
we
struck
london
when
the
coaches
used
to
be
seen
rather
said
jim
anstruther
used
to
tell
me
about
them
coaches
bigger
than
cobb
and
smart
as
paint
with
teams
of
four
so
matched
you
could
hardly
tell
which
was
which
and
educated
beyond
anything
australians
could
dream
about
there
was
one
man
poor
chap
anstruther
said
he
was
drowned
in
the
who
had
a
team
of
four
black
cobs
i
think
anstruther
used
to
dream
about
them
at
night
he
got
poetical
and
incoherent
when
he
tried
to
describe
fancy
seeing
a
dozen
or
so
of
those
coaches
swinging
down
piccadilly
on
a
fine
morning
said
wally
that
would
be
something
to
tell
black
billy
about
norah
he
only
say
plenty
said
norah
laughing
look
there
dad
they
turned
to
meet
a
tall
grey
man
who
came
swinging
across
the
grass
with
a
step
as
light
as
his
son
david
linton
greeted
them
with
a
smile
i
knew
i
should
find
you
as
near
as
you
could
get
to
the
horses
he
said
this
place
is
almost
a
after
harrod
i
never
find
myself
in
that
amazing
shop
without
wishing
i
had
a
bell
on
my
neck
so
that
i
could
get
lost
and
i
always
take
the
wrong
lift
and
find
myself
among
garden
tools
when
all
i
want
is
collars
well
they
have
lifts
round
every
corner
you
want
a
special
not
to
take
the
wrong
one
norah
defended
him
yes
and
when
you
ask
your
way
anywhere
in
one
of
these
london
shops
they
say
the
archway
sir
and
disappear
and
you
look
round
you
frantically
and
see
about
seventeen
different
archways
and
there
you
are
wally
stated
so
you
plunge
into
them
all
in
turn
and
get
hopelessly
lost
but
it
rather
fun
i
like
it
better
if
they
did
call
me
said
norah
moddam
certainly
moddam
first
to
the
right
second
to
the
left
lift
number
fifteen
fifth
floor
and
the
attendant
will
direct
you
then
you
stagger
into
space
wishing
for
a
wet
towel
round
your
head
i
could
almost
believe
said
her
father
regarding
her
gravely
that
you
would
prefer
cunjee
with
one
street
one
general
store
one
blacksmith
and
not
much
else
at
all
why
of
course
i
do
norah
laughed
at
least
you
ca
get
lost
there
and
you
have
got
half
a
day
journey
from
the
oatmeal
place
to
the
ribbon
department
they
sell
you
both
at
the
same
counter
and
a
and
a
new
song
too
think
of
the
economy
of
time
and
and
wilkins
knows
all
about
you
and
talks
to
you
like
a
nice
fat
uncle
while
he
wraps
up
your
parcels
and
if
on
a
young
horse
you
need
get
off
at
all
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
and
wilkins
comes
out
prepared
to
sell
you
all
his
shop
on
the
footpath
if
is
more
convenient
than
seventeen
archways
and
lifts
then
i
like
to
know
what
is
moddam
always
had
a
great
turn
of
eloquence
had
she
murmured
wally
eyeing
her
with
respect
whereat
norah
reddened
and
laughed
and
accused
him
of
sentiments
precisely
similar
to
her
own
i
think
we
all
much
the
same
jim
said
london
all
very
well
for
a
visit
but
just
imagine
what
it
would
be
if
we
did
know
we
were
going
back
to
billabong
some
day
what
a
horrible
idea
norah
said
but
we
are
when
the
old
over
and
the
kaiser
has
retired
to
helena
and
the
huns
are
busy
building
up
belgium
and
france
and
you
both
be
captains
if
you
are
brigadiers
and
all
billabong
will
expect
to
see
you
come
back
in
uniform
glittering
with
medals
and
things
i
like
their
chance
said
wally
firmly
anyhow
we
all
go
back
and
that
all
that
matters
said
norah
her
eyes
dwelt
wistfully
on
the
two
tall
lads
and
meanwhile
said
jim
we
all
go
down
to
fuller
and
have
morning
tea
one
thing
young
norah
you
wo
find
a
fuller
in
cunjee
why
would
i
be
trying
norah
asked
cheerfully
sure
is
there
brownie
at
billabong
hear
hear
agreed
wally
when
i
think
of
brownie
pikelets
or
brownie
scones
added
norah
or
her
or
brownie
as
large
and
as
brown
as
herself
said
linton
then
london
is
a
desert
but
we
make
the
best
of
it
for
the
present
come
along
to
fuller
chapter
ii
the
home
for
tired
people
to
begin
with
said
jim
what
the
place
like
eighty
acres
with
improvements
answered
his
father
and
three
farms
all
let
daddy
you
like
an
auctioneer
advertisement
norah
protested
tell
us
what
it
is
the
house
i
mean
we
run
down
and
see
it
soon
said
linton
meanwhile
the
lawyers
tell
me
it
a
good
house
queen
anne
style
what
that
queried
jim
oh
gables
and
things
said
wally
airily
go
on
sir
please
standing
in
park
lands
said
linton
fishing
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
reading
from
it
sorry
norah
but
i
ca
remember
all
these
thrills
without
the
lawyers
letter
lounge
hall
four
reception
rooms
who
are
you
going
to
receive
nor
be
quiet
said
norah
aiming
a
cushion
at
the
offender
not
you
if
you
not
extra
polite
be
quiet
all
of
you
or
i
will
discontinue
this
penny
reading
said
linton
severely
thirteen
bedrooms
three
baths
and
hydraulic
and
condensed
murmured
wally
jim
sat
upon
him
with
silent
firmness
and
the
reading
was
unchecked
excellent
domestic
offices
modern
drainage
central
heating
electric
plant
company
water
what
on
earth
said
jim
i
really
do
know
said
his
father
but
i
suppose
it
means
you
can
turn
taps
without
fear
of
a
drought
or
they
would
put
it
grounds
including
shady
gardens
walled
kitchen
garden
terrace
lily
pond
excellent
pasture
squash
racquet
court
what
that
asked
norah
you
play
it
with
pumpkins
came
muffled
from
beneath
jim
let
me
up
jimmy
i
be
good
that
be
something
unusual
said
jim
rising
yes
dad
stabling
heated
garage
thatched
cottage
fine
timber
two
of
the
farms
let
on
long
leases
one
lease
expires
with
lease
of
house
all
in
excellent
order
i
think
that
about
all
so
there
you
are
norah
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
it
was
the
next
morning
and
the
treacherous
september
sunshine
had
vanished
giving
place
to
a
cold
wet
drizzle
which
blurred
the
windows
of
the
lintons
flat
in
south
kensington
looking
down
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
a
few
mackintoshed
pedestrians
splashing
dismally
along
the
wet
grey
street
across
the
road
the
trees
in
a
little
fenced
square
were
already
getting
shabby
and
a
few
leaves
fluttered
idly
down
the
brief
gay
english
summer
had
gone
already
the
grey
heralds
of
the
sky
sounded
the
approach
of
winter
long
and
cold
and
gloomy
i
been
thinking
terribly
hard
norah
said
i
do
think
i
ever
lay
awake
so
long
in
my
life
but
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
of
course
it
must
be
some
way
of
helping
the
war
but
how
we
could
make
it
a
hospital
could
we
i
think
not
said
her
father
the
hospital
idea
occurred
to
me
but
i
do
think
it
would
do
you
see
you
need
nurses
and
a
big
staff
and
doctors
and
already
that
kind
of
thing
is
organized
people
well
established
might
do
it
but
not
lone
australians
like
you
and
me
norah
how
about
a
convalescent
home
well
the
same
thing
applies
in
a
less
degree
i
believe
too
that
they
are
all
under
government
supervision
and
i
must
admit
i
no
hankering
after
that
we
would
be
able
to
call
our
souls
our
own
and
we
be
perpetually
irritated
by
government
interfering
with
us
and
giving
orders
no
i
do
think
we
could
stand
it
you
and
i
have
always
run
our
own
show
have
we
norah
that
is
until
jim
came
back
to
boss
us
he
smiled
at
his
tall
son
there
was
a
pause
well
dad
you
always
have
ideas
said
norah
in
the
voice
of
one
who
waits
patiently
linton
hesitated
i
do
know
that
i
have
anything
very
brilliant
now
he
said
but
i
was
thinking
do
you
remember
garrett
the
fellow
you
boys
used
to
tell
us
about
who
never
cared
to
get
leave
because
he
had
any
home
rather
said
the
boys
fellow
from
jamaica
he
was
an
awfully
sociable
chap
wally
added
and
he
did
like
cities
so
london
bored
him
stiff
when
he
was
alone
he
said
the
trenches
were
much
more
homelike
well
there
must
be
plenty
of
people
like
that
said
linton
especially
of
course
among
the
australians
fellows
to
whom
leave
ca
mean
what
it
should
for
want
of
a
home
and
without
any
ties
it
easy
for
them
to
get
into
all
sorts
of
mischief
and
they
should
get
all
they
can
out
of
leave
for
the
sake
of
the
war
if
for
nothing
else
they
need
a
thorough
mental
to
go
back
fresh
and
keen
so
that
they
can
give
the
very
best
of
themselves
when
the
work
begins
again
so
you
think
of
making
sir
john
place
into
a
home
for
tired
people
said
norah
excitedly
dad
it
a
lovely
plan
what
do
you
think
jim
asked
linton
yes
i
think
it
a
great
idea
jim
said
slowly
even
the
little
bit
of
france
we
had
showed
us
what
i
told
you
that
you
got
to
give
your
mind
a
whenever
you
can
if
you
want
to
keep
fit
i
suppose
if
people
are
a
bit
older
they
can
stick
it
better
some
of
them
at
least
but
when
you
in
the
line
for
any
time
you
sometimes
feel
you
just
to
forget
things
smells
and
pain
and
things
you
see
well
you
forget
pretty
soon
at
a
place
like
the
one
you
been
reading
about
said
wally
do
you
remember
jim
how
old
poor
old
garrett
used
to
look
he
was
always
cheery
and
ragging
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
often
he
used
to
look
like
his
own
grandfather
and
his
eyes
gave
you
the
creeps
and
he
could
sleep
said
jim
i
remember
if
garrett
still
going
will
you
have
him
for
your
first
patient
nor
what
will
you
call
them
by
the
way
guests
patients
cases
inmates
grinned
wally
sounds
like
a
lunatic
asylum
rejoined
jim
how
about
lodgers
or
patrons
they
be
neither
donkey
said
norah
pleasantly
just
tired
people
i
think
oh
dad
i
want
to
begin
you
should
call
your
superiors
names
especially
when
i
have
more
ideas
coming
to
me
said
jim
severely
look
here
i
agree
with
dad
that
you
could
have
a
convalescent
home
where
you
need
nurses
and
doctors
but
i
do
think
you
might
ask
fellows
on
final
like
us
who
been
discharged
from
hospitals
but
were
not
quite
fit
yet
chaps
not
really
needing
nursing
but
not
up
to
much
travelling
or
to
the
racket
and
fuss
of
an
hotel
yes
said
wally
or
chaps
who
had
lost
a
limb
and
were
trying
to
plan
out
how
they
were
going
to
do
without
it
his
young
face
looked
suddenly
grave
norah
remembered
a
saying
of
his
once
before
i
in
the
least
mind
getting
killed
but
i
do
want
fritz
to
wing
me
she
moved
a
little
nearer
to
him
that
a
grand
idea
yours
too
jimmy
she
said
dad
do
you
think
sir
john
would
be
satisfied
if
we
can
carry
out
our
plan
as
we
hope
i
think
he
would
linton
said
we
find
difficulties
of
course
and
make
mistakes
but
we
do
our
best
norah
and
if
we
can
send
back
to
the
front
cheery
men
rested
and
refreshed
and
keen
well
i
think
we
be
doing
our
bit
and
after
the
war
what
then
i
was
thinking
about
that
too
said
norah
and
i
got
a
clearer
notion
than
about
using
it
now
i
think
of
course
she
hesitated
i
do
know
much
about
money
matters
or
if
you
think
i
ought
to
keep
the
place
you
see
you
always
seem
to
have
enough
to
give
us
everything
we
want
dad
i
wo
need
to
keep
it
will
i
i
do
want
to
even
if
i
have
got
much
money
i
not
a
millionaire
said
david
linton
laughing
but
no
you
wo
need
an
english
income
norah
i
so
glad
said
norah
then
when
we
go
back
to
billabong
dad
could
we
turn
it
all
into
a
place
for
soldiers
where
they
could
work
a
bit
just
as
much
as
they
were
able
to
but
they
be
sure
of
a
home
and
would
have
any
anxiety
i
do
know
if
it
could
be
made
self
self
you
know
earning
its
own
living
assisted
her
father
yes
said
norah
gratefully
perhaps
it
could
but
they
all
have
their
pensions
to
help
them
yes
and
it
could
be
put
under
a
officer
with
a
wife
and
kids
that
he
could
support
some
poor
beggar
feeling
like
committing
suicide
because
he
could
tell
where
little
johnny
next
pair
of
boots
was
coming
from
added
jim
that
the
most
ripping
idea
norah
what
do
you
think
dad
yes
excellent
said
linton
the
details
would
want
a
lot
of
of
course
but
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
that
i
would
like
to
make
it
as
nearly
as
possible
so
that
there
would
be
no
idea
of
charity
about
it
a
kind
of
colony
said
wally
yes
it
ought
to
be
workable
the
land
is
good
and
with
and
gardening
and
intensive
culture
it
should
pay
well
enough
we
get
all
sorts
of
expert
advice
norah
and
plan
the
thing
thoroughly
and
we
call
it
colony
or
something
like
that
said
norah
her
eyes
shining
i
like
it
to
carry
on
sir
john
name
would
you
dad
indeed
yes
said
david
linton
it
has
some
sort
of
quiet
inoffensive
name
already
by
the
way
yes
homewood
well
that
sounds
nice
and
restful
said
jim
sort
of
name
like
to
think
of
in
the
trenches
when
do
we
go
to
see
it
dad
the
lawyers
have
written
to
ask
the
tenants
what
day
will
suit
them
said
his
father
they
an
old
indian
army
officer
and
his
wife
i
believe
general
somers
i
do
suppose
they
will
raise
any
objection
to
our
seeing
the
house
by
the
way
there
is
another
important
thing
there
a
motor
and
some
vehicles
and
horses
and
a
few
cows
that
go
with
the
place
used
to
like
to
have
it
ready
to
go
to
at
any
time
no
matter
how
unexpectedly
it
was
only
when
war
work
claimed
him
that
he
let
it
to
these
people
he
was
unusually
for
an
irish
landowner
it
seems
that
his
father
made
a
heap
of
money
on
the
stock
exchange
horses
said
norah
blissfully
and
a
motor
that
will
be
handy
for
bringing
the
tired
people
from
the
station
said
she
horses
that
one
could
ride
i
wonder
daddy
i
should
be
surprised
said
her
father
laughing
anyhow
i
daresay
you
will
ride
them
i
try
said
norah
modestly
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
can
i
run
the
fowls
daddy
i
like
that
job
yes
you
can
be
said
linton
as
for
me
i
shall
control
the
pigs
you
wo
be
allowed
to
said
wally
you
find
a
cold
proud
steward
or
bailiff
or
or
something
who
would
die
of
apoplexy
if
either
of
you
did
anything
so
lowering
you
may
be
allowed
to
ride
norah
but
it
wo
be
an
australian
scurry
have
to
be
awfully
prim
and
proper
and
have
a
groom
trotting
behind
you
with
a
he
beamed
upon
her
cheerfully
me
said
norah
aghast
wally
do
talk
of
such
horrible
things
it
rubbish
is
it
dad
grooms
and
do
seem
to
be
included
in
the
catalogue
said
linton
studying
it
bless
you
that
not
necessary
said
jim
i
mean
you
need
get
too
bucked
because
they
not
public
opinion
will
force
you
to
get
them
probably
nor
will
have
to
ride
in
a
too
never
said
norah
firmly
unless
you
promise
to
do
it
too
jimmy
my
king
and
country
have
called
me
said
jim
with
unction
therefore
i
shall
accompany
you
in
uniform
and
watch
you
trying
to
keep
the
on
it
will
be
ever
so
cheery
you
wo
said
norah
you
be
in
the
mud
in
flanders
and
then
broke
off
and
changed
the
subject
laboriously
there
were
few
subjects
that
did
not
furnish
more
or
less
fun
to
the
linton
family
but
norah
never
could
manage
to
joke
successfully
about
even
the
flanders
mud
which
appeared
to
be
a
matter
for
humorous
recollection
to
jim
and
wally
whenever
the
thought
of
their
return
to
that
dim
and
terrible
region
that
had
swallowed
up
so
many
crossed
her
vision
something
caught
at
her
heart
and
made
her
breath
come
unevenly
she
knew
they
must
go
she
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
even
had
it
been
certain
that
they
would
never
come
back
to
her
but
that
they
should
not
so
alive
so
splendid
in
their
laughing
strength
the
agony
of
the
thought
haunted
her
dreams
no
matter
how
she
strove
to
put
it
from
her
by
day
jim
saw
the
shadow
in
her
eyes
and
came
to
her
rescue
there
was
never
a
moment
when
jim
and
norah
failed
to
understand
each
other
you
want
a
good
deal
of
organization
about
that
place
dad
he
said
i
suppose
you
try
to
grow
things
vegetables
and
crops
i
been
trying
to
look
ahead
said
linton
this
is
only
the
second
year
of
the
war
and
i
never
thought
it
would
be
a
short
business
it
does
seem
to
me
that
england
realizes
war
at
all
so
far
everything
goes
on
just
the
same
not
only
as
usual
but
other
things
too
pleasure
luxuries
eating
clothes
everything
as
usual
i
reckon
that
conscription
is
bound
to
come
and
before
the
hun
gets
put
in
his
place
nearly
every
man
in
these
islands
will
be
forced
to
help
in
the
job
i
think
you
about
right
jim
said
well
then
other
things
will
happen
when
the
men
go
food
will
get
scarcer
the
enemy
will
sink
more
and
more
ships
everything
that
the
shops
and
the
farmers
sell
will
get
dearer
and
dearer
and
many
things
will
cease
to
exist
altogether
you
find
that
coal
will
run
short
and
live
stock
will
get
scarce
because
people
wo
be
able
to
get
imported
food
stuffs
that
they
depend
on
now
oh
it
my
idea
that
there
are
tight
times
coming
for
the
people
of
england
and
that
of
course
means
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
in
planning
a
home
for
tired
people
tired
people
must
be
well
fed
and
kept
warm
ca
we
do
it
daddy
queried
norah
distressed
we
going
to
try
my
girl
but
i
looking
ahead
one
farm
comes
in
with
the
house
you
know
i
think
we
had
better
get
a
man
to
run
that
with
us
on
the
shares
system
and
we
grow
every
bit
of
food
for
the
house
that
we
can
we
have
plenty
of
good
cows
plenty
of
fowls
vegetables
fruit
we
grow
potatoes
wherever
we
can
put
them
in
and
we
make
thorough
provision
for
storing
food
that
will
keep
eggs
in
water
glass
said
norah
and
i
make
tons
of
jam
and
bottle
tons
of
fruit
and
vegetables
yes
we
find
out
how
to
preserve
lots
of
things
that
we
know
nothing
about
now
i
do
in
the
least
imagine
that
if
real
shortage
came
private
people
would
be
allowed
to
store
food
but
a
house
run
for
a
war
purpose
might
be
different
anyhow
there
no
shortage
yet
so
there
no
harm
in
beginning
as
soon
as
we
can
of
course
we
ca
do
very
much
before
we
grow
things
and
that
wo
be
until
next
year
there
marmalade
said
norah
wisely
and
apple
jam
and
we
dry
apples
and
if
the
hens
are
good
there
may
be
eggs
to
save
hens
get
discouraged
in
an
english
winter
and
i
sure
i
do
blame
them
said
jim
laughing
never
mind
nor
they
buck
up
in
the
spring
then
there
the
question
of
labour
said
linton
i
inclined
to
employ
only
men
who
would
be
conscripted
soldiers
or
sailors
who
could
still
work
or
men
with
other
physical
drawbacks
lots
of
men
whose
hearts
are
too
weak
to
go
the
from
the
trenches
could
drive
a
plough
quite
well
then
if
conscription
does
come
we
shall
be
safe
i
like
to
do
it
too
said
norah
it
would
be
jolly
to
help
them
of
course
it
will
cut
both
ways
linton
said
there
should
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
men
of
the
kind
poor
lads
there
are
plenty
of
disabled
ones
i
inclined
to
think
that
the
question
of
women
servants
will
be
more
difficult
well
i
can
cook
a
bit
said
norah
thanks
to
brownie
my
dear
child
said
her
father
slightly
irritated
you
no
idea
of
what
a
fairly
big
english
house
means
apart
from
housekeeping
and
managing
we
shall
need
a
really
good
housekeeper
as
well
as
a
cook
and
goodness
knows
how
many
maids
under
her
you
see
the
thing
has
got
to
be
done
very
thoroughly
if
it
were
just
you
and
the
boys
and
me
you
cook
our
eggs
and
bacon
and
keep
us
quite
comfortable
but
it
will
be
quite
another
matter
when
we
fill
up
all
those
rooms
with
tired
people
i
suppose
so
said
norah
meekly
but
i
can
be
useful
daddy
he
patted
her
shoulder
of
course
you
can
mate
i
only
afraid
you
have
too
much
to
do
i
must
say
i
wish
brownie
were
here
instead
of
in
australia
dear
old
brownie
would
she
love
it
all
said
norah
her
eyes
tender
at
the
thought
of
the
old
woman
who
had
been
nurse
and
mother
and
mainspring
of
the
billabong
house
since
norah
own
mother
had
laid
her
baby
in
her
kind
arms
and
closed
tired
eyes
so
many
years
ago
would
she
love
fixing
the
house
and
how
she
hate
cooking
with
coal
instead
of
wood
only
nothing
would
make
brownie
not
even
wal
and
i
said
jim
and
i
bet
we
were
trying
enough
to
damage
a
saint
patience
however
as
we
ca
have
brownie
i
suppose
you
advertise
for
some
one
else
dad
oh
i
suppose
so
but
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
returned
linton
i
thought
of
nothing
but
this
inheritance
of
norah
all
day
and
i
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
it
going
to
be
an
inheritance
of
something
very
like
hard
work
well
that
all
right
there
should
be
any
loafers
in
norah
said
she
looked
out
of
the
window
the
rain
is
stopping
come
along
everybody
and
we
go
down
regent
street
on
a
to
do
which
norah
always
maintained
was
the
finest
thing
in
london
they
went
down
to
see
norah
inheritance
two
days
later
a
quick
train
from
london
dropped
them
at
a
tiny
station
where
the
stationmaster
a
grizzled
man
apparently
given
over
to
the
care
of
nasturtiums
directed
them
to
homewood
a
walk
of
a
mile
along
a
wide
white
road
brought
them
to
big
iron
gates
standing
open
beside
a
tiny
lodge
with
windows
set
in
under
overhanging
eaves
and
all
smothered
with
ivy
out
of
which
sparrows
fluttered
busily
the
lodgekeeper
a
neat
woman
looked
at
the
party
curiously
no
doubt
the
news
of
their
coming
had
spread
from
the
lodge
the
drive
to
the
house
wound
through
the
park
a
wide
stretch
of
green
with
noble
trees
oak
beech
and
elm
not
towering
like
norah
native
but
flinging
wide
arms
as
though
to
embrace
as
much
as
possible
of
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
bracken
beginning
to
turn
gold
fringed
the
edge
of
the
gravelled
track
a
few
sheep
and
cows
were
to
be
seen
across
the
grass
sheep
said
linton
yes
but
you
would
call
it
was
jim
comment
jim
was
not
used
to
english
parks
he
was
apt
to
think
of
any
grass
as
feed
in
terms
of
so
many
head
per
acre
the
drive
and
smoothly
rolled
took
them
on
sauntering
slowly
until
it
turned
in
a
great
sweep
round
a
lawn
ending
under
a
stone
porch
flung
out
from
the
front
of
the
house
a
wide
porch
almost
a
verandah
to
the
delighted
eyes
of
the
australians
who
considered
houses
a
curious
english
custom
verging
on
lunacy
near
the
house
it
was
shut
in
with
glass
and
furnished
with
a
few
lounge
chairs
and
a
table
or
two
that
a
jolly
place
jim
said
quickly
the
house
itself
was
long
and
rambling
and
covered
with
ivy
there
were
big
windows
it
seemed
planned
to
catch
all
the
sunlight
that
could
possibly
be
tempted
into
it
the
lawn
ended
in
a
terrace
with
a
stone
balustrade
where
one
could
sit
and
look
across
the
park
and
to
woods
beyond
it
now
turning
a
little
yellow
in
the
sunlight
and
soon
to
glow
with
orange
and
and
bronze
when
the
early
frosts
should
have
painted
the
dying
leaves
from
the
lawn
to
right
and
left
ran
shrubberies
and
with
winding
grass
walks
why
it
lovely
norah
breathed
she
slipped
a
hand
into
her
father
arm
jim
rang
the
bell
a
severe
butler
appeared
and
explained
that
general
and
somers
had
gone
out
for
the
day
and
had
begged
that
linton
and
his
party
would
make
themselves
at
home
and
explore
the
house
and
grounds
thoroughly
an
arrangement
which
considerably
relieved
the
minds
of
the
australians
who
had
rather
dreaded
the
prospect
of
poking
about
the
house
under
the
eyes
of
its
tenants
the
butler
stiffened
respectfully
at
the
sight
of
the
boys
uniforms
it
appeared
presently
that
he
had
been
a
in
days
gone
by
and
now
regarded
himself
as
the
personal
property
of
the
general
very
sorry
they
are
to
leave
the
too
sir
said
the
butler
a
nice
place
but
too
big
for
them
have
they
any
children
norah
asked
only
the
captain
miss
and
he
in
mesopotamia
which
is
an
for
any
gentleman
to
be
stuck
in
said
the
butler
with
a
fine
contempt
for
mesopotamia
and
all
its
works
and
the
mistress
is
tired
of
so
they
going
to
live
in
one
of
them
there
family
as
they
call
them
the
butler
sighed
and
then
as
if
conscious
of
having
lapsed
from
correct
behaviour
stiffened
to
rigidity
and
became
merely
butler
once
more
will
you
see
the
now
sir
they
entered
a
wide
hall
in
which
was
a
fireplace
that
drew
an
exclamation
from
norah
since
she
had
not
seen
so
large
a
one
since
she
left
billabong
this
was
built
to
take
logs
four
feet
long
to
hold
which
massive
iron
dogs
stood
in
readiness
big
leather
armchairs
and
couches
and
tables
strewn
with
magazines
and
papers
together
with
a
faint
fragrance
of
tobacco
in
the
air
gave
to
the
hall
a
comforting
sense
of
use
the
on
the
other
hand
was
chillingly
splendid
and
formal
and
looked
as
though
no
one
had
ever
sat
in
the
brocaded
chairs
and
the
great
dining
room
was
almost
as
forbidding
the
butler
intimated
that
the
general
and
his
wife
preferred
the
which
proved
to
be
a
cheery
place
facing
south
and
west
with
a
great
filled
with
flowering
plants
this
is
jolly
jim
said
but
so
would
the
other
rooms
be
if
they
were
so
awfully
empty
they
only
want
people
in
them
tired
people
norah
said
yes
wally
put
in
i
blessed
if
i
think
they
would
stay
tired
for
long
here
there
was
a
long
with
a
ghostly
table
shrouded
in
and
upstairs
a
range
of
bedrooms
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
but
all
bright
and
cheerful
and
looking
out
upon
different
aspects
of
park
and
woodland
nothing
was
out
of
order
everything
was
plain
but
care
and
taste
were
evident
in
each
detail
then
down
a
back
staircase
they
penetrated
to
outer
regions
where
the
corner
of
norah
soul
that
brownie
had
made
housewifely
rejoiced
over
a
big
bright
kitchen
with
pantries
and
larders
and
sculleries
of
the
most
modern
type
the
cook
who
looked
severe
was
reading
the
in
the
servants
hall
here
and
there
they
had
glimpses
of
smart
maids
irreproachably
clad
who
seemed
of
a
race
apart
from
either
the
cheery
friendly
housemaids
of
donegal
or
sarah
and
mary
of
billabong
who
disliked
caps
but
had
not
the
slightest
objection
to
helping
to
put
out
a
or
break
in
a
young
colt
norah
tried
to
picture
the
homewood
maids
at
either
task
and
failed
signally
from
the
house
they
wandered
out
to
visit
stables
with
room
for
a
dozen
horses
and
a
garage
where
a
big
touring
car
stood
norah
found
herself
quite
unable
to
realize
that
it
belonged
to
her
but
in
the
stables
were
living
things
that
came
and
nuzzled
softly
in
her
hand
with
inquiring
noses
that
were
evidently
accustomed
to
gifts
of
sugar
and
apples
and
norah
felt
suddenly
for
the
first
time
at
home
there
were
two
good
cobs
and
a
hunter
with
a
beautiful
lean
head
and
splendid
shoulders
a
welsh
pony
designed
for
a
roomy
in
the
coach
house
and
a
good
old
stager
able
for
anything
from
carrying
a
nervous
rider
to
drawing
a
light
plough
the
cobs
the
groom
explained
were
equally
good
in
saddle
or
harness
and
there
was
another
pony
temporarily
on
a
visit
to
a
which
sir
john
had
liked
to
ride
but
of
course
killaloe
was
sir
favourite
he
added
stroking
the
hunter
soft
brown
muzzle
there
was
no
one
could
show
them
two
the
way
in
a
big
run
they
tore
themselves
with
difficulty
from
the
stables
and
still
guided
by
the
butler
who
seemed
to
think
he
must
not
let
them
out
of
his
sight
wandered
through
the
grounds
thatched
cottage
orchard
and
walled
garden
rosery
with
a
pergola
still
covered
with
late
blooms
lawns
and
shrubberies
there
was
nothing
very
grand
but
all
was
exquisitely
kept
and
a
kind
of
still
peace
brooded
over
the
beauty
of
the
whole
and
made
war
and
its
shadows
seem
very
far
away
the
farms
and
were
at
the
western
side
of
the
park
linton
and
jim
talked
with
the
tenant
whose
lease
was
expiring
while
norah
and
wally
sat
on
an
old
oak
log
and
chatted
to
the
butler
who
told
them
tales
of
india
and
asked
questions
about
australia
being
quite
unable
to
realize
any
difference
between
the
natives
of
the
two
countries
all
niggers
i
calls
them
said
the
butler
loftily
that
seems
a
decent
fellow
said
linton
as
they
walked
back
across
the
park
hawkins
the
i
mean
has
he
made
a
success
of
his
place
do
you
know
an
excellent
name
sir
replied
the
butler
a
good
steady
man
and
a
rare
farmer
the
general
thinks
of
sorry
enough
that
lease
is
up
is
i
think
of
renewing
it
under
slightly
different
conditions
linton
observed
i
do
wish
to
turn
the
man
out
if
he
will
grow
what
i
want
well
that
good
news
said
the
butler
heartily
i
sure
do
anything
you
may
ask
to
sir
a
sudden
dull
flush
came
into
his
cheeks
and
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
linton
as
if
about
to
speak
he
checked
himself
however
and
they
returned
to
the
house
where
by
the
general
orders
coffee
and
sandwiches
awaited
the
visitors
in
the
the
butler
flitted
about
them
seeing
to
their
comfort
unobtrusively
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
sir
he
said
presently
you
be
coming
to
live
here
shortly
as
soon
as
general
somers
leaves
linton
answered
the
man
dropped
his
voice
standing
rigidly
to
attention
i
suppose
sir
he
said
wistfully
you
would
not
be
needing
a
butler
a
butler
why
i
had
thought
of
such
a
thing
said
linton
laughing
there
are
not
very
many
of
you
in
australia
you
know
but
indeed
sir
you
need
one
in
a
place
like
this
said
the
growing
bold
every
one
them
and
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
consider
if
i
do
sir
i
know
the
place
and
the
general
give
me
a
good
record
i
been
under
him
these
fifteen
years
but
he
does
need
me
after
he
leaves
here
well
said
linton
thoughtfully
but
we
sha
be
a
small
family
we
mean
to
fill
this
place
up
with
officers
needing
rest
we
coming
here
to
work
not
to
play
officers
said
the
joyfully
but
where
you
get
any
one
to
you
better
sir
lookin
after
officers
been
my
job
this
many
a
year
and
i
serve
you
faithful
sir
norah
slipped
her
hand
into
her
father
arm
we
really
would
need
him
i
believe
daddy
she
whispered
you
would
indeed
miss
said
the
butler
gratefully
i
could
valet
the
young
gentlemen
and
if
there
any
special
attention
needed
i
could
give
it
i
do
my
very
utmost
miss
i
old
to
go
out
looking
for
a
new
place
at
my
time
of
life
and
if
you
once
been
in
the
army
you
like
to
stay
as
near
it
as
you
can
well
we
see
linton
said
guardedly
i
probably
write
to
general
somers
about
you
at
which
the
butler
forgetting
his
butlerhood
came
smartly
to
attention
and
then
became
covered
with
confusion
and
concealed
himself
as
well
as
he
could
behind
a
you
might
do
much
worse
jim
remarked
on
their
way
to
the
station
he
looks
a
smart
man
and
though
this
place
is
glorious
it
going
to
take
a
bit
of
running
keep
him
for
a
bit
at
any
rate
dad
i
think
it
might
be
as
well
linton
answered
he
turned
at
a
bend
in
the
drive
to
look
back
at
homewood
standing
calm
and
peaceful
in
its
clustering
trees
well
norah
what
do
you
think
of
your
property
i
quite
unable
to
believe
it
mine
said
norah
laughing
but
i
suppose
that
will
come
in
time
however
there
one
thing
quite
certain
dad
you
and
i
will
have
to
get
very
busy
chapter
iii
of
london
and
other
matters
jim
and
wally
dropped
lightly
from
the
footboard
of
a
swift
dodged
through
the
traffic
and
swung
quickly
down
a
quiet
they
stopped
before
a
stone
house
where
from
a
window
above
norah
watched
their
eager
faces
as
jim
fitted
his
latchkey
and
opened
the
door
she
turned
back
into
the
room
with
a
little
sigh
there
they
are
dad
and
they
passed
fit
i
know
david
linton
looked
up
from
the
he
was
making
well
it
had
to
come
mate
he
said
yes
i
know
but
i
hoped
it
would
said
poor
norah
inconsistently
you
would
like
them
not
to
go
said
her
father
and
then
cheery
footsteps
clattered
up
the
stairs
and
the
boys
burst
in
passed
shouted
jim
fit
as
fiddles
when
norah
asked
this
day
week
so
we
have
nice
time
to
settle
you
into
homewood
and
try
those
horses
wo
we
yes
rather
said
norah
were
they
quite
satisfied
with
your
arm
wally
yes
they
say
it
a
lovely
arm
said
that
gentleman
modestly
i
always
knew
it
but
it
nice
to
have
other
people
agreeing
with
me
and
they
say
our
lungs
are
beautiful
too
not
a
trace
of
gas
left
and
oh
you
tell
them
jim
and
we
not
to
go
out
yet
said
jim
grinning
widely
special
course
at
aldershot
first
and
after
that
a
bombing
course
so
there
you
are
he
broke
off
his
utterance
hindered
by
the
fact
that
norah
had
suddenly
hugged
him
very
hard
while
david
linton
jumping
up
caught
wally
hand
not
the
front
my
dear
boys
well
not
yet
said
wally
pumping
the
hand
and
finding
searching
for
his
free
one
it
pretty
decent
is
it
because
every
one
knows
there
will
be
plenty
of
war
at
the
front
yet
plenty
indeed
said
linton
i
say
buck
up
old
chap
said
jim
patting
norah
shoulder
very
hard
one
would
think
we
were
booked
for
the
trenches
i
would
have
made
an
ass
of
myself
if
you
had
been
said
norah
shaking
back
her
curls
and
mopping
her
eyes
defiantly
i
was
prepared
for
that
and
then
you
struck
me
all
of
a
heap
oh
jimmy
i
am
glad
i
like
to
hug
the
war
office
you
the
first
person
i
ever
heard
with
such
sentiments
returned
her
brother
most
people
want
to
heave
bombs
at
it
however
they
treated
us
decently
and
no
mistake
you
see
ever
since
june
we
kept
bothering
them
to
go
out
and
then
getting
and
having
to
cave
in
again
and
now
that
we
really
are
all
right
i
suppose
they
think
they
make
sure
of
us
so
that
that
i
would
have
been
awfully
wild
if
they
had
passed
us
wally
said
but
since
they
have
and
they
put
us
to
work
i
do
weep
a
bit
at
being
kept
back
for
awhile
lots
of
chaps
seem
to
think
being
at
the
front
is
heavenly
but
i
blessed
if
i
can
see
it
that
way
we
did
have
very
much
time
there
certainly
but
there
were
only
three
ingredients
in
what
we
did
have
mud
barbed
wire
and
gas
yes
and
it
not
much
of
a
mixture
said
jim
all
the
same
got
to
be
taken
if
necessary
still
i
not
sorry
it
postponed
for
a
bit
there
will
be
heaps
of
war
yet
and
meanwhile
we
just
learning
the
trade
he
straightened
his
great
shoulders
i
never
felt
so
horribly
young
and
ignorant
as
when
i
found
men
in
my
charge
in
france
poor
old
jimmy
always
did
take
his
responsibilities
heavily
said
wally
laughing
linton
looked
at
his
big
son
remembering
a
certain
letter
from
his
commanding
officer
which
had
caused
him
and
norah
to
glow
with
pride
remembering
also
how
the
men
on
billabong
station
had
worked
under
master
jim
but
he
knew
that
soldiering
had
always
been
a
serious
business
to
his
boy
personal
danger
had
never
entered
into
jim
mind
but
the
danger
of
ignorant
handling
of
his
men
had
been
a
tremendous
thing
to
him
even
without
mud
and
gas
jim
was
never
likely
to
enjoy
war
in
the
way
in
which
wally
would
certainly
take
it
under
more
pleasant
conditions
well
we
a
week
then
boys
he
said
cheerfully
and
no
anxieties
immediately
before
us
except
the
new
well
goodness
knows
they
are
enough
norah
said
fervently
anything
more
settled
jim
asked
i
have
an
ecstatic
letter
from
allenby
allenby
was
the
he
seems
in
a
condition
of
trembling
joy
at
the
prospect
of
being
our
butler
and
what
is
more
to
the
point
he
says
he
has
a
niece
whom
he
can
recommend
as
a
housemaid
so
i
have
told
him
to
instal
her
before
we
get
to
homewood
on
thursday
hawkins
has
written
a
list
of
things
he
will
require
for
the
farm
but
i
have
had
time
to
study
it
yet
and
norah
has
had
letters
from
nineteen
all
asking
for
a
deposit
the
boys
roared
that
makes
does
it
nor
wally
asked
something
like
it
norah
admitted
ruefully
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
not
one
of
them
will
guarantee
so
much
as
a
kitchenmaid
they
say
sadly
that
the
present
crisis
it
difficult
to
supply
servants
they
do
seem
to
think
there
any
difficulty
about
paying
them
that
phrase
the
present
crisis
is
the
backbone
of
business
linton
said
if
a
shop
ca
sell
you
anything
or
if
they
mislay
your
property
or
sell
your
purchase
to
some
one
else
or
keep
your
repairs
six
months
and
then
lose
them
or
send
in
your
account
with
a
lot
of
items
you
never
ordered
or
received
they
simply
wave
present
crisis
at
you
and
all
is
well
yes
but
they
do
regard
it
as
any
excuse
if
you
pay
too
little
or
do
pay
at
all
jim
said
of
course
not
that
would
be
business
my
son
said
wally
laughing
the
one
department
the
crisis
does
hit
is
the
one
that
sends
out
bills
he
turned
to
norah
what
about
the
nor
she
safe
said
norah
sighing
with
relief
there
an
awfully
elegant
letter
from
her
saying
she
come
oh
that
good
business
jim
said
for
a
fortnight
norah
had
had
the
unforgettable
experience
of
sitting
in
attempting
to
engage
a
staff
for
homewood
she
had
always
been
escorted
by
one
or
more
of
her
male
belongings
and
their
extreme
ignorance
of
how
to
conduct
the
business
had
been
plain
to
the
meanest
intelligence
the
whose
spirit
of
meekness
in
proposing
himself
had
been
in
extraordinary
contrast
to
the
condescending
truculence
of
other
candidates
had
been
thankfully
retained
there
had
at
times
seemed
a
danger
that
instead
of
butler
he
might
awake
to
find
himself
since
not
one
of
the
applicants
came
up
to
even
norah
limited
standard
finally
however
linton
had
refused
to
enter
any
more
or
to
let
norah
enter
them
describing
them
in
good
set
terms
as
abominable
holes
and
judicious
advertising
had
secured
them
a
housekeeper
who
seemed
promising
and
a
cook
who
insisted
far
more
on
the
fact
that
she
was
a
lady
than
on
any
ability
to
prepare
meals
the
family
while
not
enthusiastic
was
hopeful
i
hope
she
all
right
norah
said
doubtfully
i
suppose
we
expect
much
they
all
tell
you
that
nearly
every
servant
in
england
has
into
munitions
which
always
sounds
as
though
she
get
fired
out
of
a
presently
some
of
those
we
saw
might
be
benefited
by
the
process
said
linton
shuddering
at
memories
of
well
what
about
the
rest
have
you
got
to
get
a
kitchenmaid
and
some
more
housemaids
or
things
queried
jim
vaguely
i
not
going
to
try
here
said
linton
firmly
life
is
too
short
i
sooner
be
my
own
kitchenmaid
than
let
norah
into
one
of
those
offices
again
allenby
niece
will
have
to
double
a
few
parts
at
first
and
i
written
to
ireland
to
moroney
to
see
if
she
can
find
us
two
or
three
nice
country
girls
i
believe
she
be
able
to
do
it
meanwhile
we
throw
care
to
the
winds
i
told
allenby
to
order
in
all
necessary
stores
so
that
we
can
be
sure
of
getting
something
to
eat
when
we
go
down
beyond
that
i
decline
to
worry
or
let
norah
worry
about
anything
then
let
go
out
and
play
cried
norah
jumping
up
right
said
the
boys
where
oh
anywhere
we
settle
as
we
go
said
norah
airily
she
fled
for
her
hat
and
coat
so
they
went
to
the
tower
of
london
a
place
little
known
to
the
english
but
of
which
australians
never
tire
and
spent
a
blissful
afternoon
in
the
armoury
examining
every
variety
of
weapons
and
armament
from
crusaders
to
rifles
there
is
no
place
so
full
of
old
stories
and
of
history
history
that
suddenly
becomes
quite
a
different
matter
from
something
you
learn
by
the
out
of
an
extremely
dull
book
at
school
this
is
history
alive
and
the
dim
old
tower
becomes
peopled
with
gay
and
gallant
figures
clad
in
shining
armour
bent
on
knightly
adventures
there
you
see
mail
shirts
of
woven
links
that
slip
like
silken
mesh
through
the
fingers
yet
could
withstand
the
deadliest
thrust
of
a
dagger
maces
with
spiked
heads
that
only
a
mighty
man
could
swing
swords
such
as
that
with
which
could
slice
through
such
a
mace
as
though
it
were
no
more
than
a
carrot
sinuous
blades
that
saladin
loved
that
would
sever
a
down
cushion
flung
in
the
air
daggers
and
poignards
too
of
every
age
yet
viciously
strong
with
exquisitely
inlaid
hilts
and
blades
long
rapiers
that
brought
visions
of
gallants
with
curls
and
lace
stocks
and
silken
hose
as
ready
to
fight
as
to
dance
or
to
make
a
poem
to
a
fair
lady
eyebrow
helmets
of
every
age
with
visors
behind
which
the
knights
of
old
had
looked
grimly
as
they
charged
down
the
lists
at
gentle
and
joyous
passages
of
arms
of
amazing
weight
i
always
pictured
those
old
knights
prancing
out
on
a
hack
but
you
want
a
suffolk
punch
to
carry
that
ironmongery
said
wally
so
through
room
after
room
each
full
of
brave
ghosts
of
the
past
looking
benevolently
at
the
tall
from
the
new
world
until
at
length
came
and
they
went
out
reluctantly
across
the
flagged
yard
where
poor
young
anne
boleyn
laid
her
gentle
head
on
the
block
where
the
ravens
hop
and
caw
as
their
ancestors
did
in
the
sixteenth
century
when
she
walked
across
from
her
grim
prison
that
still
bears
on
its
wall
a
scrawled
anne
a
dull
little
it
must
have
been
after
the
glitter
and
pomp
of
castles
and
palaces
with
only
the
rugged
walls
of
the
tower
yard
to
look
upon
from
the
tiny
window
and
she
must
have
had
such
a
jolly
good
time
at
first
said
wally
old
henry

then
she
was
only
his
second
wife
by
the
time
he
had
six
they
must
have
begun
to
feel
themselves
rather
they
found
a
that
took
them
by
devious
ways
through
the
city
the
part
of
london
that
many
londoners
never
see
since
it
is
another
world
from
the
world
of
bond
street
and
oxford
street
with
their
newness
and
their
glittering
shops
but
to
the
queer
folk
who
come
from
overseas
it
is
the
real
london
and
they
wander
in
its
narrow
streets
and
link
fingers
with
the
past
old
names
look
down
from
the
walls
black
friars
and
white
friars
bread
street
martin
lane
leadenhall
street
temple
bar
the
hurrying
crowd
of
fades
and
instead
come
ghosts
of
armed
men
and
of
less
ready
to
work
than
to
fight
of
gallants
with
ruffs
and
fierce
of
the
days
of
queen
bess
home
from
the
spanish
main
with
ships
laden
with
gold
swaggering
up
from
the
docks
to
spend
their
as
quickly
as
they
earned
it
visions
of
dark
nights
with
running
beside
carrying
exquisite
ladies
to
routs
and
masques
of
slinking
into
dark
alleys
and
doorways
as
the
watch
comes
tramping
down
the
street
visions
of
the
hunting
stout
lads
into
every
tavern
whisking
them
from
their
and
off
to
the
ships
to
disappear
with
never
a
word
of
farewell
until
years
later
bronzed
and
tarred
and
strange
of
speech
they
returned
to
astounded
families
who
had
long
mourned
them
as
dead
visions
of
queen
bess
with
her
haughty
face
and
her
red
hair
riding
through
the
city
that
adored
her
her
white
palfrey
stepping
daintily
through
the
cheering
crowd
and
great
gentlemen
beside
her
raleigh
essex
howard
they
all
wander
together
through
the
grey
streets
where
the
buildings
tower
overhead
all
blending
together
a
formless
jumble
of
the
past
and
yet
very
much
alive
and
it
does
not
seem
to
matter
in
the
least
that
you
look
down
upon
them
from
a
rattling
that
leaves
pools
of
oil
where
perchance
lay
the
puddle
over
which
raleigh
flung
his
cloak
lest
his
queen
slipper
should
be
soiled
very
soon
we
shall
look
down
on
the
city
from
airships
while
conductors
come
and
stamp
our
tickets
with
a
but
the
old
city
will
be
unchanged
and
it
will
be
only
we
who
look
upon
it
who
will
pass
like
shadows
from
its
face
the
australians
left
their
in
fleet
street
and
dived
down
a
narrow
lane
to
a
low
doorway
with
the
sign
of
the
the
old
inn
with
sanded
floor
and
bare
oak
benches
and
tables
where
johnson
and
his
followers
used
to
meet
to
dine
and
afterwards
to
smoke
long
churchwarden
pipes
and
talk
as
wally
said
such
amazing
fine
language
that
it
made
you
feel
a
little
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
australians
had
not
any
great
enthusiasm
for
johnson
they
had
paid
a
visit
of
inspection
to
the
room
upstairs
where
the
great
man
used
to
take
his
ease
but
not
one
of
them
had
felt
any
desire
to
sit
in
his
big
armchair
you
do
understand
what
a
chance
you
scorning
linton
had
said
laughing
as
his
family
turned
from
the
seat
of
honour
why
good
americans
die
happy
if
they
can
only
say
they
have
sat
in
johnson
chair
think
he
was
an
old
man
quoth
norah
with
her
nose
tilted
which
seemed
to
end
the
matter
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
but
if
the
billabong
family
took
no
interest
in
johnson
they
had
a
deep
affection
for
the
old
inn
itself
they
loved
its
dim
rooms
with
their
blackened
oak
and
it
was
a
delight
to
watch
the
medley
of
people
who
came
there
for
meals
actors
artists
literary
folk
famous
and
otherwise
americans
foreigners
colonials
politicians
fighting
men
of
both
services
busy
city
men
for
everybody
comes
sooner
or
later
to
the
old
being
people
of
plain
tastes
they
liked
the
solid
honest
meals
especially
since
increasing
were
already
inducing
hotels
and
restaurants
everywhere
to
disguise
a
tablespoonful
of
hashed
oddments
under
an
elegant
french
name
and
sell
it
for
as
much
money
as
a
dinner
for
a
hungry
man
norah
used
to
fight
shy
of
the
famous
until
it
was
whispered
to
her
that
what
was
not
good
beef
steaks
in
the
dish
was
nothing
more
than
pigeon
or
possibly
even
sparrow
after
which
she
enjoyed
it
and
afterwards
pilgrimaged
to
the
kitchen
to
see
the
great
blue
bowls
as
big
as
a
basin
in
which
the
puddings
have
been
made
since
johnson
time
and
the
great
copper
in
which
they
are
boiled
all
night
legend
says
that
any
one
who
can
eat
three
helpings
of
is
presented
with
all
that
remains
but
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
a
hero
able
to
manage
his
third
plateful
best
of
all
the
billabong
folk
loved
the
great
cellars
under
the
inn
which
were
once
the
cloisters
of
an
old
monastery
where
there
are
unexpected
steps
and
dim
archways
and
winding
paths
where
it
is
very
easy
to
imagine
that
you
see
friars
with
brown
habits
and
rope
girdles
pacing
slowly
along
there
they
bought
quaint
brown
jars
and
of
the
kind
that
are
used
and
have
always
been
used
on
the
tables
above
but
best
of
all
were
the
great
oaken
beams
above
them
solid
as
england
itself
but
blackened
and
charred
by
the
great
fire
of
norah
used
to
touch
the
burned
surface
gently
wondering
if
it
was
not
a
dream
if
the
hand
on
the
broken
charcoal
were
really
her
own
more
used
to
bosun
bridle
on
the
wide
plains
of
billabong
there
were
not
many
people
in
the
room
as
they
came
in
this
evening
for
it
was
early
dinner
indeed
was
scarcely
ready
and
a
few
customers
sat
about
reading
evening
papers
and
discussing
the
war
news
in
one
corner
were
an
officer
and
a
lady
and
at
sight
of
the
former
jim
and
wally
saluted
and
broke
into
joyful
smiles
the
officer
jumped
up
and
greeted
them
warmly
hullo
boys
he
said
i
delighted
to
see
you
fit
again
you
look
it
dad
this
is
major
hunt
jim
said
dragging
his
father
forward
you
remember
of
our
regiment
and
my
sister
sir
i
say
awfully
glad
to
see
you
come
and
meet
my
wife
said
major
hunt
stella
here
are
the
two
young
australians
that
used
to
make
my
life
a
burden
everybody
shook
hands
indiscriminately
and
presently
they
joined
forces
round
a
big
table
while
jim
and
wally
poured
out
questions
concerning
the
regiment
and
every
one
in
it
most
of
them
are
going
strong
major
hunt
said
we
have
a
good
few
casualties
of
course
but
we
have
lost
many
officers
most
of
them
have
come
back
i
think
all
your
immediate
chums
are
still
in
france
but
i
been
out
of
it
myself
for
two
months
stopped
a
bit
shrapnel
with
my
hand
and
it
wo
get
better
he
indicated
a
bandaged
left
hand
as
he
spoke
and
they
realized
that
his
face
was
worn
and
deeply
lined
with
pain
it
stupid
he
said
and
laughed
but
when
are
you
coming
back
we
plenty
of
work
for
you
they
told
him
eagerly
well
you
might
just
as
well
learn
all
you
can
before
you
go
out
major
hunt
said
the
war
not
going
to
finish
this
winter
or
the
next
indeed
i
would
swear
that
my
son
who
is
drilling
hard
wo
have
time
to
be
in
at
the
finish
at
which
hunt
shuddered
and
said
do
be
so
horrible
douglas
she
was
a
slight
pretty
woman
cheery
and
pleasant
and
she
made
them
all
laugh
by
her
stories
of
work
in
a
canteen
all
the
soldiers
used
to
look
upon
us
as
just
part
of
the
furniture
she
said
they
used
to
rush
in
in
a
break
between
parades
and
give
their
orders
in
a
terrible
hurry
as
for
saying
please
well
you
ought
to
have
straightened
them
up
said
major
hunt
with
a
growl
ah
poor
boys
they
had
time
the
irish
regiments
were
better
but
then
it
is
any
trouble
for
an
irishman
to
be
polite
it
comes
to
him
naturally
but
those
stolid
english
country
lads
ca
say
things
easily
she
laughed
i
remember
a
young
who
used
often
to
come
to
our
house
to
see
my
maid
he
was
terribly
shy
and
if
i
chanced
to
go
into
the
kitchen
he
always
bolted
like
a
rabbit
into
the
scullery
the
really
terrible
thing
was
that
sometimes
i
had
to
go
on
to
the
scullery
myself
and
run
him
to
earth
among
the
saucepans
when
he
would
positively
shake
with
terror
i
used
to
wonder
how
he
ever
summoned
up
courage
to
speak
to
susan
let
alone
to
face
the
foe
when
he
went
to
france
that
the
sort
that
gets
the
without
thinking
about
it
said
major
hunt
laughing
i
was
very
busy
in
the
canteen
one
morning
it
was
a
cold
wet
day
and
the
men
rushed
us
for
hot
drinks
whenever
they
had
a
moment
presently
a
warrior
dashed
up
to
the
counter
banged
down
his
penny
and
said
in
a
voice
of
thunder
i
looked
up
and
caught
his
eye
as
i
was
turning
to
run
for
the
coffee
and
it
was
my
what
did
you
do
we
just
gibbered
at
each
other
across
the
counter
for
a
moment
i
believe
and
i
never
saw
a
face
so
then
he
turned
and
fled
leaving
his
penny
behind
him
poor
boy
i
gave
it
to
susan
to
return
to
him
did
you
ever
make
friends
with
any
of
them
mrs
hunt
norah
asked
oh
yes
when
we
had
time
or
when
they
had
but
often
one
was
on
the
rush
for
every
minute
of
our
shifts
jolly
good
of
you
said
jim
good
gracious
no
it
was
a
very
poor
sort
of
but
busy
mothers
with
only
one
maid
could
manage
more
and
i
loved
it
especially
in
cork
the
irish
boys
were
dears
and
so
keen
i
had
a
great
respect
for
those
boys
the
lads
who
enlisted
in
england
had
all
their
chums
doing
the
same
thing
and
everybody
patted
them
on
the
back
and
said
how
noble
they
were
and
gave
them
parties
and
speeches
and
presents
but
the
irish
boys
enlisted
very
often
dead
against
the
wishes
of
their
own
people
and
against
their
priest
and
got
to
live
in
ireland
to
know
what
means
the
wonder
to
me
was
always
the
number
of
irishmen
who
did
enlist
said
major
hunt
and
are
they
fighters
they
must
be
great
jim
said
you
should
hear
our
fellows
talk
about
the
dublins
and
the
munsters
in
gallipoli
his
face
clouded
it
was
a
grievous
matter
to
jim
that
he
had
not
been
with
those
other
australian
boys
who
had
already
made
the
name
of
anzac
ring
through
the
world
yes
you
must
be
very
proud
of
your
country
hunt
said
with
her
charming
smile
i
tell
my
husband
that
we
must
emigrate
there
after
the
war
it
must
be
a
great
place
in
which
to
bring
up
children
judging
by
all
the
australians
one
sees
possibly
but
a
man
with
a
damaged
hand
is
wanted
there
major
hunt
said
curtly
oh
you
be
all
right
long
before
we
want
to
go
out
was
his
wife
cheerful
response
but
there
was
a
shadow
in
her
eyes
wally
did
not
notice
any
shadow
he
had
major
hunt
in
his
first
days
of
soldiering
when
that
officer
a
mons
veteran
with
the
to
his
credit
had
been
chiefly
responsible
for
the
training
of
subalterns
and
major
hunt
in
his
turn
had
liked
the
two
australian
boys
who
whatever
their
faults
of
carelessness
or
ignorance
were
never
anything
but
keen
now
in
his
delight
at
meeting
his
senior
officer
again
wally
chattered
away
like
a
magpie
asking
questions
telling
irish
and
other
stories
of
adventures
in
ireland
hazarding
wild
opinions
about
the
war
and
generally
manifesting
a
cheerful
disregard
of
the
fact
that
the
tired
man
opposite
him
was
not
a
subaltern
as
irresponsible
as
himself
somehow
the
weariness
died
out
of
major
hunt
eyes
he
began
to
joke
in
his
turn
and
to
tell
queer
yarns
of
the
trenches
and
presently
indeed
the
whole
party
seemed
to
be
infected
by
the
same
spirit
so
that
the
old
walls
of
the
echoed
laughter
that
must
have
been
exceedingly
discouraging
to
the
ghost
of
johnson
if
as
is
said
that
unamiable
maker
of
dictionaries
haunts
his
ancient
tavern
well
you
made
us
awfully
cheerful
said
major
hunt
when
dinner
was
over
and
they
were
dawdling
over
coffee
stella
and
i
were
feeling
rather
down
on
our
luck
i
believe
when
you
appeared
and
now
we
forgotten
all
about
it
do
you
always
behave
like
this
miss
linton
no
i
have
to
be
very
sedate
or
i
never
keep
my
big
family
in
order
said
norah
laughing
you
no
idea
what
a
responsibility
they
are
have
i
said
he
you
forget
i
have
a
houseful
of
my
own
tell
me
about
them
norah
asked
do
you
keep
them
in
order
we
say
we
do
for
the
sake
of
discipline
but
i
not
too
sure
about
it
said
hunt
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
very
strict
but
douglas
undoes
all
my
good
work
is
it
really
true
that
he
is
strict
in
the
regiment
mr
jim
jim
and
wally
shuddered
i
find
it
easier
to
tell
you
if
he
was
here
jim
said
there
are
awful
memories
are
there
wal
rather
said
wally
feelingly
do
you
remember
the
day
i
salute
on
parade
i
believe
your
mangled
remains
were
carried
off
the
said
jim
with
a
twinkle
i
expect
i
should
have
been
one
of
the
only
that
was
the
day
i
was
improperly
dressed
what
you
did
come
on
parade
in
a
did
you
his
father
asked
no
but
i
had
a
undone
it
nearly
as
bad
is
it
sir
jim
grinned
at
major
hunt
if
i
could
remember
the
frown
at
the
moment
i
would
assume
it
said
that
officer
laughing
never
mind
i
deal
with
you
both
when
we
all
get
back
you
have
told
me
about
the
family
norah
persisted
the
family
you
are
strict
with
i
mean
she
added
kindly
you
have
no
more
respect
for
a
than
your
brother
has
said
he
whisper
said
hunt
he
was
only
a
subaltern
himself
before
the
war
her
husband
eyed
her
severely
you
get
put
under
arrest
if
you
make
statements
liable
to
excite
indiscipline
among
the
troops
he
said
do
listen
to
her
miss
linton
and
i
tell
you
about
the
family
she
spoils
geoffrey
who
is
six
and
alison
who
five
at
least
i
think
five
is
she
stella
much
you
know
of
your
babies
said
his
wife
with
a
fine
scorn
alison
wo
be
five
for
two
months
has
she
a
passion
for
detail
said
her
husband
admiringly
well
miss
linton
and
finally
there
a
named
michael
and
when
they
all
get
going
together
they
make
rather
more
noise
than
a
regiment
but
they
rather
jolly
and
i
hope
you
come
and
see
them
oh
do
said
hunt
geoff
would
just
love
to
hear
about
australia
he
told
me
the
other
day
that
when
he
grows
up
he
means
to
go
out
there
and
be
a
kangaroo
i
suppose
you
know
you
must
never
check
a
child
natural
ambitions
linton
told
her
gravely
was
that
your
plan
she
laughed
oh
my
pair
had
any
ambitions
beyond
sitting
on
horses
perpetually
and
pursuing
cattle
said
linton
that
was
very
useful
to
me
so
i
certainly
did
check
it
h
said
jim
regarding
him
inquiringly
i
wonder
how
your
theory
would
have
lasted
dad
if
i
grown
my
hair
long
and
taken
to
painting
that
would
have
been
a
natural
ambition
at
all
so
i
should
have
been
able
to
deal
with
it
with
a
clear
conscience
said
his
father
laughing
in
any
case
the
matter
could
safely
have
been
left
to
norah
she
would
have
been
more
than
equal
to
it
i
trust
so
said
norah
pleasantly
with
long
hair
jimmy
it
amazing
and
painful
to
see
the
number
of
fellows
who
take
long
hair
into
khaki
with
them
said
major
hunt
the
old
army
custom
was
to
get
your
hair
cut
over
the
comb
for
home
service
and
under
the
comb
for
active
service
jolly
good
rule
too
but
the
subaltern
of
the
new
army
goes
into
the
trenches
with
locks
like
a
musician
at
least
too
many
of
him
does
never
could
understand
any
one
caring
for
the
bother
of
long
hair
said
jim
running
his
hand
over
his
dark
poll
i
say
is
it
time
we
made
a
move
if
we
going
to
a
show
he
looked
at
hunt
wo
you
and
the
major
come
with
us
been
so
jolly
meeting
you
good
idea
said
linton
cutting
across
hunt
protest
do
come
i
know
norah
is
longing
to
be
asked
to
meet
the
family
and
that
will
give
you
time
to
fix
it
up
he
any
further
objections
by
the
simple
process
of
ignoring
them
whereupon
the
hunts
wisely
gave
up
manufacturing
any
more
and
presently
they
had
discovered
two
taxis
norah
and
her
father
taking
hunt
in
the
first
leaving
the
three
soldiers
to
follow
in
the
second
they
slid
off
through
the
traffic
of
fleet
street
we
really
should
let
you
take
possession
of
us
like
this
said
hunt
a
little
helplessly
but
it
has
been
so
lovely
to
see
douglas
cheerful
again
he
has
not
laughed
so
much
for
months
you
are
anxious
about
his
hand
david
linton
asked
yes
very
he
has
had
several
kinds
of
treatment
for
it
but
it
does
seem
to
get
better
and
the
pain
is
wearing
the
doctors
say
his
best
chance
is
a
thorough
change
as
well
as
treatment
but
we
ca
manage
it
the
three
babies
are
expensive
atoms
now
there
is
a
probability
of
another
operation
to
his
hand
and
he
has
been
so
depressed
about
it
that
i
dragged
him
out
to
dinner
in
the
hope
of
cheering
him
up
but
i
do
think
i
should
have
succeeded
if
we
had
met
you
it
was
great
luck
for
us
norah
said
the
boys
have
always
told
us
so
much
of
major
hunt
he
was
ever
so
good
to
them
he
told
me
about
them
too
said
hunt
he
liked
them
because
he
said
he
never
succeeded
in
boring
them
why
you
could
bore
jim
and
wally
said
norah
laughing
then
a
great
idea
fell
upon
her
and
she
grew
silent
leaving
the
conversation
to
her
companions
as
the
taxi
whirred
on
its
swift
way
through
the
crowded
streets
until
they
drew
up
before
the
theatre
in
the
vestibule
she
found
her
father
close
to
her
and
endeavoured
to
convey
many
things
to
him
by
squeezing
his
arm
very
hard
among
the
crowd
succeeding
in
so
much
that
linton
knew
perfectly
well
that
norah
was
the
victim
of
a
new
idea
and
was
quite
content
to
wait
to
be
told
what
it
was
but
there
was
no
chance
of
that
until
the
evening
was
over
and
they
had
bade
farewell
to
the
hunts
arranging
to
have
tea
with
them
next
day
after
which
a
taxi
bore
them
to
the
kensington
flat
and
they
gathered
in
the
while
norah
brewed
coffee
over
a
i
jolly
glad
we
met
the
hunts
jim
said
but
is
it
cruel
luck
for
a
man
like
that
to
be
kept
back
by
a
damaged
hand
rough
on
hunt
too
wally
remarked
she
looked
about
as
seedy
as
he
did
daddy
said
norah
eagerly
david
linton
laughed
yes
i
knew
you
had
one
he
said
out
with
it
i
listen
they
tired
people
said
norah
and
waited
yes
they
certainly
tired
enough
said
her
father
but
the
children
norah
i
do
think
we
could
possibly
take
in
little
children
considering
the
other
weary
inmates
no
i
thought
that
too
norah
answered
eagerly
but
do
you
remember
the
cottage
daddy
why
should
they
have
it
by
jove
said
jim
that
jolly
little
thatched
place
yes
it
has
several
rooms
they
could
let
their
own
house
and
then
they
save
heaps
of
money
it
would
get
them
right
out
of
london
and
hunt
told
me
that
london
is
the
very
worst
place
for
him
the
doctors
said
so
that
is
certainly
an
idea
linton
said
it
near
enough
to
london
for
hunt
to
run
up
for
his
treatment
we
could
see
that
they
were
comfortable
he
smiled
at
norah
whose
flushed
face
was
dimly
visible
through
the
steam
of
the
coffee
i
think
it
would
be
rather
a
good
way
to
begin
our
job
norah
it
would
be
so
nice
that
it
does
feel
like
any
sort
of
work
said
norah
i
think
you
may
find
a
chance
of
work
they
have
three
small
children
and
not
much
money
said
her
father
prophetically
i
say
i
hope
the
major
would
agree
jim
put
in
i
know
horribly
proud
we
kidnap
the
babies
and
then
they
just
have
to
come
norah
laughed
picture
linton
said
wally
happily
carrying
on
the
good
work
by
stalking
through
london
with
three
kids
sticking
out
of
his
pockets
followed
by
norah
armed
with
wounded
officer
and
wife
hard
in
pursuit
armed
with
shot
guns
supplemented
jim
i
like
your
pacifist
ideas
of
running
a
home
for
tired
people
i
must
say
why
they
would
forget
that
they
had
ever
been
tired
said
norah
i
think
it
rather
a
brilliant
notion
there
certainly
would
be
another
convalescent
home
in
england
run
on
the
same
lines
but
you
not
good
on
matters
of
detail
people
do
have
for
babies
of
that
age
i
not
well
up
in
babies
said
wally
nice
people
but
i
like
somebody
else
to
manage
i
thought
bottles
were
pretty
safe
until
they
were
about
seven
well
we
talk
it
over
with
the
hunts
the
cottage
not
the
bottles
linton
said
meanwhile
it
so
everybody
he
dispersed
the
assembly
by
the
simple
process
of
switching
off
the
electric
light
smiling
to
himself
as
jim
and
norah
singing
down
the
tiny
corridor
in
the
darkness
but
the
post
brought
a
worried
little
note
from
hunt
putting
off
the
party
her
husband
had
had
a
bad
report
on
his
hand
that
morning
and
was
going
into
hospital
for
an
immediate
operation
she
hoped
to
fix
a
day
later
on
the
note
was
a
little
incoherent
norah
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
three
small
hunts
who
made
rather
more
noise
than
a
regiment
rampaging
round
the
harassed
mother
as
she
tried
to
write
perhaps
it
as
well
we
study
the
cottage
and
make
sure
that
it
all
right
for
them
said
her
father
then
we
kidnap
them
meanwhile
we
go
and
send
them
a
big
hamper
of
fruit
and
put
some
sweets
in
for
the
babies
a
plan
which
was
so
completely
after
norah
heart
that
she
quite
forgot
her
disappointment
chapter
iv
settling
in
they
bade
to
the
flat
early
next
morning
and
went
down
to
homewood
through
a
dense
fog
that
rolled
up
almost
to
the
carriage
windows
like
masses
of
white
wool
at
the
station
the
closed
carriage
waited
for
them
with
the
brown
cobs
pawing
the
ground
impatiently
general
somers
chauffeur
had
gone
with
his
master
and
so
far
they
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
a
substitute
but
the
groom
and
coachman
who
were
also
gardeners
in
their
spare
time
considered
themselves
part
and
parcel
of
the
place
and
had
no
idea
of
changing
their
home
the
cart
for
the
luggage
will
be
here
presently
sir
jones
the
old
coachman
told
linton
so
they
left
a
bewildering
assortment
of
and
trunks
piled
up
on
the
platform
in
the
care
of
an
ancient
porter
and
packed
themselves
into
the
carriage
norah
was
wont
to
say
that
the
only
vehicle
capable
of
accommodating
her
three
long
comfortably
was
an
omnibus
the
fog
was
lifting
as
they
rolled
smoothly
up
the
long
avenue
and
just
as
they
came
within
sight
of
the
house
a
gleam
of
pale
sunlight
found
its
way
through
the
misty
clouds
and
lingered
on
the
gables
the
front
door
was
flung
wide
to
welcome
them
on
the
steps
hovered
the
wearing
a
discreet
smile
behind
him
fluttered
a
print
dress
and
a
white
apron
presumably
worn
by
his
niece
i
say
norah
do
you
feel
like
the
queen
of
sheba
entering
her
ancestral
halls
whispered
wally
wickedly
as
they
mounted
the
steps
if
she
felt
simply
horrible
then
i
do
returned
norah
i
suppose
i
get
used
to
it
in
time
but
at
present
i
want
a
hollow
log
to
crawl
into
allenby
greeted
them
respectfully
we
did
not
know
what
rooms
you
would
like
sir
he
said
they
are
all
practically
ready
of
course
my
niece
miss
thought
you
might
prefer
the
blue
bedroom
her
name
is
sarah
miss
we
do
want
the
best
rooms
the
sunniest
i
mean
norah
said
they
must
be
for
the
tired
people
must
they
dad
well
there
are
no
tired
people
except
ourselves
at
present
said
her
father
laughing
so
if
you
have
a
fancy
for
any
room
you
had
better
take
it
do
you
think
well
we
tour
round
and
see
said
norah
diplomatically
with
mental
visions
of
the
sudden
of
rooms
should
weary
guests
arrive
it
might
be
better
to
settle
down
from
the
first
as
we
mean
to
be
a
lady
has
come
miss
said
allenby
i
understood
her
to
say
she
was
the
cook
but
perhaps
i
made
a
mistake
he
paused
questioningly
his
face
comically
puzzled
oh
miss
de
lisle
yes
miss
oh
yes
she
the
cook
said
norah
and
the
housekeeper
mrs
atkins
no
one
else
has
arrived
miss
well
i
expect
she
come
said
norah
at
least
she
promised
miss
de
lisle
miss
asked
for
her
kitchenmaid
there
is
one
at
present
said
norah
feeling
a
little
desperate
oh
said
allenby
looking
blank
i
i
am
afraid
miss
that
the
lady
expects
one
well
she
ca
have
one
until
one
comes
said
linton
cheer
up
norah
i
talk
to
miss
de
lisle
i
be
the
kitchenmaid
if
necessary
said
wally
cheerfully
what
does
one
do
allenby
shuddered
visibly
my
niece
i
am
sure
will
do
all
she
can
sir
he
said
his
gaze
dwelt
on
wally
uniform
it
was
easy
to
see
him
quailing
in
spirit
before
the
vision
of
an
officer
with
a
kitchen
mop
perhaps
miss
if
you
would
like
to
see
the
rooms
they
trooped
upstairs
the
silent
house
suddenly
waking
to
life
with
the
quick
footsteps
and
cheery
voices
the
big
front
bedrooms
were
at
once
put
aside
for
future
guests
norah
fell
in
love
with
and
promptly
appropriated
a
little
room
that
appeared
to
have
been
tucked
into
a
corner
by
the
architect
as
an
afterthought
it
was
curiously
shaped
with
a
quaint
little
nook
for
the
bed
and
had
a
big
window
furnished
with
a
low
cushioned
seat
wide
enough
for
any
one
to
curl
up
with
a
book
linton
and
the
boys
selected
rooms
principally
remarkable
for
bareness
jim
had
a
lively
hatred
for
furniture
they
left
him
discussing
with
allenby
the
question
of
removing
a
writing
table
linton
and
norah
went
downstairs
with
sinking
hearts
to
encounter
miss
de
lisle
on
the
way
appeared
sarah
very
clean
and
starched
as
to
dress
very
pink
and
shiny
as
to
complexion
her
hair
was
strained
back
from
her
forehead
so
tightly
it
appeared
to
be
pulling
her
eyes
up
oh
sarah
said
linton
pausing
yes
sir
said
sarah
meekly
you
may
be
required
to
help
the
cook
for
a
few
days
until
we
er
until
the
staff
is
complete
said
her
employer
your
uncle
tells
me
you
will
have
no
objection
it
being
understood
sir
as
it
is
only
tempory
said
sarah
firmly
oh
quite
said
linton
hurriedly
and
of
course
i
will
help
you
with
the
housework
sarah
put
in
norah
sarah
looked
more
wooden
than
before
thank
you
miss
i
sure
she
returned
they
went
on
does
she
make
you
feel
a
worm
said
norah
this
is
a
terrible
business
norah
said
linton
fervently
i
did
guess
what
brownie
was
saving
me
from
all
these
years
they
found
miss
de
lisle
in
the
kitchen
where
an
enormous
range
glowed
like
a
fiery
furnace
in
which
respect
miss
de
lisle
rather
resembled
it
she
was
a
tall
stout
woman
dressed
in
an
overall
several
sizes
too
small
for
her
the
overall
was
and
miss
de
lisle
was
many
shades
deeper
in
hue
she
accepted
their
greetings
without
enthusiasm
and
plunged
at
once
into
a
catalogue
of
grievances
the
butler
tells
me
there
is
no
kitchenmaid
she
boomed
wrathfully
and
i
had
not
expected
such
an
antiquated
range
nor
could
i
possibly
manage
with
these
saucepans
sweeping
a
scornful
hand
towards
an
array
which
seemed
to
the
hapless
lintons
to
err
only
on
the
side
of
magnificence
there
will
be
a
number
of
necessary
items
and
where
am
i
to
sit
you
will
hardly
expect
me
to
herd
with
the
servants
it
would
be
rough
on
them
rose
to
norah
lips
but
she
prudently
kept
the
reflection
to
herself
to
sit
echoed
linton
why
i
really
had
thought
of
it
his
brow
cleared
oh
there
is
the
housekeeper
room
and
who
is
the
housekeeper
is
she
a
lady
she
has
said
so
yet
said
linton
it
was
evident
that
he
considered
this
a
point
in
the
absent
housekeeper
favour
miss
de
lisle
flamed
anew
i
can
not
sit
with
your
housekeeper
she
averred
you
must
remember
linton
that
i
told
you
when
engaging
with
you
that
i
expected
special
treatment
and
must
remember
said
linton
with
sudden
firmness
that
we
ourselves
have
not
been
half
an
hour
in
the
house
and
that
we
must
have
time
to
make
arrangements
as
for
what
you
require
we
will
see
into
that
later
miss
de
lisle
sniffed
it
not
what
i
am
accustomed
to
she
said
however
i
will
wait
and
the
kitchenmaid
i
ca
make
a
kitchenmaid
out
of
nothing
said
linton
gloomily
i
hope
to
hear
of
one
in
a
day
or
two
i
have
written
to
ireland
to
ireland
ejaculated
miss
de
lisle
in
accents
of
horror
my
dear
sir
do
you
know
what
irish
maids
are
like
they
the
nicest
maids
i
know
said
norah
speaking
for
the
first
time
and
so
kind
and
obliging
h
sniffed
the
but
you
are
not
sure
of
obtaining
even
one
of
these
treasures
well
we
all
help
said
norah
sarah
will
give
you
a
hand
until
we
get
settled
and
my
brother
and
meadows
and
i
can
do
anything
there
ca
be
such
an
awful
lot
of
work
she
stopped
miss
de
lisle
was
regarding
her
with
an
eye
in
which
horror
and
amazement
were
mingled
but
we
do
such
things
in
england
she
gasped
your
brother
and
the
other
officer
in
my
kitchen
may
i
ask
well
one
moment
you
seem
afraid
of
too
much
work
and
the
next
of
too
much
help
said
norah
laughing
you
find
them
very
useful
i
trust
that
i
have
never
been
afraid
of
work
said
miss
de
lisle
severely
but
i
have
my
position
to
consider
there
are
duties
which
belong
to
it
and
other
duties
which
do
not
my
province
is
cooking
cooking
and
nothing
else
who
i
ask
is
to
keep
my
kitchen
clean
me
if
necessary
said
a
voice
in
which
allenby
the
butler
was
clearly
merged
in
allenby
the
sergeant
begging
your
pardon
sir
he
was
deferential
again
save
for
the
eye
with
which
he
glared
upon
miss
de
lisle
i
think
perhaps
between
me
and
sarah
and
er
this
lady
we
can
arrange
matters
for
the
present
without
troubling
you
or
miss
linton
do
said
his
employer
thankfully
he
beat
a
retreat
followed
by
norah
rather
to
norah
disappointment
she
was
beginning
to
feel
warlike
and
hankered
for
the
battle
with
allenby
ranged
on
her
side
i
going
to
love
allenby
she
said
with
conviction
as
they
gained
the
outer
regions
he
a
trump
said
her
father
but
is
that
a
terrible
woman
norah
here
another
anyhow
said
norah
with
a
wild
inclination
to
giggle
a
dismal
cab
halted
at
a
side
entrance
and
the
driver
was
struggling
with
a
stout
iron
trunk
the
passenger
a
tall
angular
woman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
the
housekeeper
breathed
linton
faintly
do
you
feel
equal
to
her
norah
he
fled
with
disgraceful
weakness
to
the
good
morning
norah
said
advancing
good
morning
returned
the
newcomer
with
severity
i
have
rung
three
times
oh
we
a
little
shorthanded
said
norah
and
began
to
giggle
hopelessly
to
her
own
dismay
her
world
seemed
suddenly
full
of
important
upper
servants
with
no
one
to
wait
on
them
it
was
rather
terrible
but
beyond
doubt
it
was
very
funny
to
an
australian
mind
the
housekeeper
gazed
at
her
with
a
sort
of
cold
anger
i
afraid
i
do
know
which
is
your
room
norah
said
recovering
under
that
glare
you
see
we
only
just
come
send
allenby
she
hurried
off
meeting
the
butler
in
the
passage
oh
allenby
she
said
it
the
housekeeper
and
her
trunk
allenby
what
does
a
housekeeper
do
she
wo
clean
the
kitchen
for
miss
de
lisle
will
she
i
afraid
not
miss
said
allenby
his
manner
grew
confidential
had
he
not
been
so
correct
a
butler
norah
felt
that
he
might
have
patted
her
head
now
look
miss
he
said
you
just
leave
them
women
to
me
i
fix
them
and
do
you
worry
oh
thank
you
allenby
said
norah
gratefully
she
followed
in
her
father
wake
leaving
the
butler
to
advance
upon
the
wrathful
figure
that
yet
blocked
the
side
doorway
in
the
all
her
were
gathered
looking
guilty
it
awful
to
see
you
all
huddling
together
here
out
of
the
storm
said
norah
laughing
is
it
all
terrible
do
you
think
ever
settle
down
daddy
indeed
i
would
be
too
certain
responded
linton
gloomily
how
did
you
get
on
norah
was
she
anything
like
miss
de
lisle
that
an
appalling
woman
she
ought
to
stand
for
parliament
she
not
like
miss
de
lisle
but
i
not
sure
that
she
any
nicer
said
norah
she
very
skinny
and
vinegarish
i
say
daddy
we
going
to
have
a
wild
time
well
if
she
and
the
get
going
the
encounter
should
be
worth
seeing
remarked
jim
talk
about
the
kilkenny
cats
i
only
hope
it
will
come
off
before
we
go
said
wally
gleefully
we
have
had
much
war
yet
have
we
jim
i
think
we
deserve
to
see
a
little
i
should
much
prefer
it
in
some
one
else
house
said
linton
with
haste
but
it
bound
to
come
i
should
think
and
then
i
shall
be
called
in
as
referee
well
australia
was
never
like
this
still
there
are
compensations
he
went
out
returning
in
a
moment
with
a
battered
hat
of
soft
grey
felt
now
you
be
happy
said
norah
laughing
i
am
responded
her
father
he
put
on
the
hat
with
tender
care
i
have
been
so
comfortable
since
i
was
in
ireland
it
one
of
the
horrors
of
war
that
david
linton
of
billabong
has
worn
a
stiff
bowler
hat
for
nearly
a
year
never
mind
no
one
in
australia
would
believe
it
unless
they
saw
it
photographed
said
jim
soothingly
and
it
has
had
to
be
a
so
you
really
have
had
to
bear
the
worst
that
is
certainly
something
said
his
father
in
the
dim
future
i
suppose
you
and
norah
may
get
married
but
i
warn
you
here
and
now
that
you
need
expect
me
to
appear
in
a
however
no
need
to
face
these
problems
yet
thank
goodness
suppose
we
leave
the
kitchen
to
fight
it
out
alone
and
go
and
inspect
the
cottage
it
nestled
at
the
far
side
of
a
belt
of
shrubbery
a
cheery
thatched
place
with
wide
casement
windows
that
looked
out
on
a
trim
stretch
of
grass
at
one
side
there
was
actually
a
little
verandah
a
sight
so
unusual
in
england
that
the
australians
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
certainly
it
was
only
a
very
tiny
verandah
within
all
was
bright
and
cheery
and
simple
the
cottage
had
been
used
as
a
barracks
when
the
sons
of
a
former
owner
had
brought
home
boy
friends
two
rooms
were
fitted
with
bunks
built
against
the
wall
as
in
a
ship
cabin
there
was
a
little
plainly
furnished
and
a
big
that
took
up
the
whole
width
of
the
building
and
had
casement
windows
on
three
sides
there
was
a
roomy
kitchen
from
which
a
staircase
ascended
to
big
attics
one
of
which
was
fitted
as
a
bedroom
it
no
end
of
a
jolly
place
was
jim
verdict
i
do
know
that
i
would
rather
live
here
than
in
your
mansion
norah
but
i
suppose
it
would
do
i
think
it
would
be
rather
nice
norah
said
but
you
ca
because
we
want
it
for
the
hunts
and
it
will
be
splendid
for
them
wo
it
dad
yes
i
think
it
will
do
very
well
said
linton
we
get
the
housekeeper
to
come
down
and
make
sure
that
it
has
enough
pots
and
pans
and
working
outfit
generally
and
then
we
go
up
to
london
and
kidnap
hunt
and
the
babies
said
norah
pirouetting
gently
now
shall
we
go
and
see
the
horses
they
spent
a
blissful
in
the
stables
and
arranged
to
ride
in
the
afternoon
the
old
coachman
was
plainly
delighted
at
the
absence
of
a
chauffeur
and
displayed
his
treasures
with
a
pride
to
which
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
the
enough
to
do
since
sir
john
used
to
come
he
said
the
general
did
care
for
them
an
infantry
gent
he
must
have
been
and
it
was
always
the
motor
for
we
exercised
of
course
but
it
ai
the
same
to
the
and
do
they
know
it
of
course
they
do
norah
caressed
killaloe
lean
head
you
hunt
him
sir
wo
you
this
season
asked
jones
anxiously
the
meets
ai
what
they
was
of
course
but
there
a
few
goes
out
still
the
master
a
lady
ainslie
her
husband
in
france
he
the
these
five
years
oh
we
hunt
wo
we
dad
norah
face
glowed
as
she
lifted
it
rather
said
jim
of
course
you
will
what
about
the
other
horses
jones
can
they
jump
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
said
jones
happily
there
not
one
of
them
that
ca
even
the
cobs
ai
too
bad
and
the
black
pony
that
at
the
vet
a
flyer
be
the
vet
sent
me
word
yesterday
that
shoulder
all
right
strained
it
a
bit
did
of
course
they
ai
made
hunters
like
killaloe
but
they
quick
and
clever
and
once
you
know
the
country
and
the
short
cuts
and
the
gaps
you
can
generally
manage
to
see
most
of
a
run
he
sighed
ecstatically
eh
but
it
be
like
old
times
to
get
ready
again
on
a
hunting
morning
the
gong
sounded
from
the
house
and
they
bade
the
stables
a
reluctant
lunch
waited
in
the
there
was
a
pleasant
sparkle
of
silver
and
glass
on
a
little
table
in
the
window
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
miss
de
lisle
could
cook
if
her
temper
were
as
good
as
her
pastry
i
should
say
we
had
found
a
treasure
said
linton
looking
at
the
fragments
which
remained
of
a
superlative
let
hope
that
moroney
will
discover
a
kitchenmaid
or
two
and
that
they
will
induce
her
to
overlook
our
other
shortcomings
i
afraid
we
never
be
genteel
enough
for
her
said
norah
shaking
her
curly
head
and
the
other
servants
will
all
hate
her
because
she
thinks
they
are
fit
for
her
to
speak
to
if
she
only
knew
how
much
nicer
allenby
is
or
brownie
said
wally
loyally
brownie
could
beat
that
pie
with
one
hand
tied
behind
her
allenby
entered
sympathy
on
every
line
of
his
face
the
atkins
would
like
to
see
you
sir
or
miss
linton
and
so
would
miss
de
lisle
but
miss
de
lisle
was
on
his
heels
breathing
threatenings
and
slaughter
there
must
be
some
arrangement
made
as
to
my
instructions
she
boomed
your
housekeeper
evidently
does
not
understand
my
position
she
has
had
the
impertinence
to
address
me
as
cook
she
paused
for
breath
glaring
but
good
gracious
is
it
your
profession
asked
linton
miss
de
lisle
fairly
choked
with
wrath
wally
voice
fell
like
oil
on
a
stormy
sea
if
i
could
make
a
pie
like
that
i
to
be
called
said
he
it
it
a
regular
poem
of
a
pie
whereat
jim
choked
in
his
turn
and
endeavoured
with
signal
lack
of
success
to
turn
his
emotion
into
a
sneeze
miss
de
lisle
lowering
countenance
cleared
somewhat
she
looked
at
wally
in
a
manner
that
was
almost
kindly
cookery
is
a
makeshift
not
an
art
she
said
before
the
war
i
could
have
shown
you
what
cooking
could
be
that
pie
was
a
makeshift
persisted
wally
it
was
a
dream
i
say
miss
de
lisle
can
you
make
pikelets
yes
of
course
said
the
do
you
like
them
i
go
into
a
trap
for
a
pikelet
said
wally
warming
to
his
task
oh
norah
do
ask
miss
de
lisle
if
she
make
some
for
tea
oh
do
pleaded
norah
as
a
matter
of
stern
fact
norah
preferred
to
pikelets
but
the
human
beam
in
the
eye
was
not
to
be
neglected
we
have
had
any
for
ages
she
cast
about
for
further
encouragement
for
the
beam
miss
de
lisle
i
suppose
you
have
a
very
special
i
make
my
own
recipes
said
the
with
pride
but
for
the
war
i
should
have
brought
out
my
book
by
jove
you
do
say
so
said
jim
i
say
norah
you
have
to
get
that
when
it
comes
out
rather
said
norah
i
wonder
would
it
bother
you
awfully
to
show
me
some
day
how
to
make
meringues
i
never
can
get
them
right
we
see
said
miss
de
lisle
graciously
and
would
you
really
like
pikelets
for
tea
please
if
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
very
well
jim
held
the
door
open
for
the
as
she
marched
out
suddenly
she
paused
you
will
see
the
housekeeper
mr
linton
oh
certainly
said
david
linton
hastily
the
door
closed
behind
it
they
could
hear
a
tread
heavy
and
martial
dying
away
a
fearsome
woman
said
linton
wally
you
deserve
a
medal
but
are
we
always
to
lick
the
ground
under
the
cook
feet
in
this
fashion
oh
she
find
her
level
said
jim
but
you
better
tell
atkins
not
to
offend
her
again
talk
to
her
like
a
father
dad
say
she
and
miss
de
lisle
are
here
to
run
the
house
not
to
bother
you
and
norah
it
excellent
in
theory
said
his
father
sadly
but
in
practice
i
find
my
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
when
these
militant
females
tackle
me
and
if
you
saw
atkins
you
would
realize
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
me
to
regard
her
as
a
daughter
but
i
do
my
best
atkins
admitted
by
the
sympathetic
allenby
proved
less
fierce
than
the
although
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
could
she
have
been
called
pleasant
i
have
never
worked
with
a
cook
as
considered
herself
a
lady
she
remarked
it
makes
all
very
difficult
and
no
and
am
i
in
authority
or
am
i
not
and
such
airs
turning
up
her
nose
at
being
called
cook
which
if
she
is
the
cook
why
not
be
called
so
and
going
off
to
her
bedroom
with
her
dinner
no
one
downstairs
being
good
enough
to
eat
with
her
i
must
say
it
is
what
i
used
to
and
me
lived
with
the
first
families
the
first
atkins
ceased
her
weary
monologue
and
gazed
on
the
family
with
conscious
virtue
she
was
dressed
in
dull
black
silk
and
looked
overwhelmingly
respectable
oh
well
you
must
put
up
with
things
as
they
are
said
linton
vaguely
miss
de
lisle
expects
a
few
unusual
things
but
apparently
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
can
do
her
work
i
hope
to
have
more
maids
in
a
few
days
if
not
a
brilliant
idea
striking
him
i
must
send
you
up
to
london
to
find
us
some
mrs
atkins
i
shall
be
delighted
sir
replied
the
housekeeper
primly
and
do
i
understand
that
the
cook
is
to
have
a
separate
oh
for
goodness
sake
ask
allenby
ejaculated
her
employer
it
will
have
to
be
managed
somewhere
or
we
shall
have
no
cook
chapter
v
how
the
found
her
level
two
days
later
the
morning
mail
brought
relief
not
too
soon
for
there
was
evidence
that
the
battle
between
the
housekeeper
and
the
could
not
be
much
longer
delayed
and
sarah
was
going
about
with
a
face
of
wooden
agony
that
gave
norah
a
chilly
feeling
whenever
she
encountered
her
allenby
alone
retained
any
cheerfulness
and
much
of
that
was
due
to
ancient
military
discipline
therefore
moroney
letter
was
hailed
with
acclamation
two
maids
she
can
recommend
bless
her
heart
said
linton
she
does
label
their
particular
activities
but
says
they
be
willing
to
do
anything
at
all
that
the
kind
i
like
said
norah
thankfully
and
their
names
are
bride
kelly
and
katty
does
that
bring
killard
and
brown
bogs
back
to
you
and
oh
by
jove
what
is
it
demanded
his
family
in
unison
this
is
what
it
is
do
know
would
your
honour
remember
con
hegarty
that
was
shofer
to
sir
john
at
rathcullen
and
a
decent
boy
with
one
leg
and
he
after
coming
back
from
the
war
he
have
no
job
since
sir
john
died
and
he
bid
me
tell
you
he
be
proud
to
drive
a
car
for
you
and
to
be
with
ye
all
and
if
he
have
only
one
leg
itself
he
as
handy
as
any
one
with
two
or
more
sir
john
had
him
with
him
at
homewood
and
he
knows
the
car
that
there
and
is
the
way
if
you
had
a
job
for
him
he
could
take
the
two
girls
over
when
he
went
and
he
used
to
travelling
the
world
that
all
i
think
linton
ended
what
luck
jim
ejaculated
we
could
have
a
better
chauffeur
i
wonder
we
never
thought
of
con
said
his
father
a
nice
boy
like
to
have
him
so
would
i
added
norah
when
will
you
get
them
dad
i
write
at
once
and
send
a
cheque
for
their
fares
said
her
father
i
tell
them
to
send
me
a
telegram
when
they
start
he
rose
to
leave
the
room
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
morning
children
we
all
turning
out
the
cottage
norah
answered
promptly
i
have
told
sarah
she
disapproves
of
me
so
painfully
if
i
do
any
work
and
hurts
my
feelings
by
always
doing
it
over
again
if
possible
at
the
same
time
she
looks
so
unhappy
about
working
at
all
and
sighs
so
often
that
i
do
feel
equal
to
telling
her
that
the
cottage
has
to
be
done
so
jim
and
wally
have
nobly
volunteered
to
help
me
do
knock
yourself
up
said
her
father
will
you
want
me
no
unless
you
like
to
come
as
a
guest
and
sit
still
and
do
nothing
my
two
housemaids
and
i
can
easily
finish
off
that
little
job
there
not
really
a
great
deal
to
do
norah
added
the
place
is
very
clean
only
one
likes
to
have
everything
extra
nice
when
tired
people
come
well
i
not
coming
to
sit
still
and
do
nothing
said
her
father
firmly
so
i
stay
at
home
and
write
letters
he
watched
them
from
the
terrace
a
little
later
racing
across
the
lawn
and
smiled
a
little
it
was
so
unlikely
that
this
family
of
his
would
ever
really
grow
up
the
house
was
very
quiet
that
morning
atkins
and
miss
de
lisle
having
quarrelled
over
the
question
of
dinner
had
retreated
the
one
to
the
housekeeper
room
the
other
to
the
kitchen
sarah
went
about
her
duties
sourly
allenby
was
sarah
uncle
and
as
such
felt
some
duty
to
her
which
he
considered
he
had
discharged
in
getting
her
a
good
place
beyond
that
sarah
frankly
bored
him
and
he
saw
no
reason
to
let
her
regard
him
as
anything
else
than
a
butler
bad
for
discipline
too
he
reflected
therefore
allenby
was
lonely
he
read
the
in
the
seclusion
of
his
pantry
and
then
strolling
through
the
hall
with
a
watchful
eye
alert
lest
a
speck
of
dust
should
have
escaped
sarah
he
saw
his
master
cross
the
garden
and
strike
across
the
park
in
the
direction
of
hawkins
farm
every
one
else
was
out
allenby
knew
not
where
an
impulse
for
fresh
air
fell
upon
him
and
he
sauntered
towards
the
shrubbery
voices
and
laughter
came
to
him
from
the
cottage
he
pushed
through
the
shrubs
and
found
himself
near
a
window
and
peeping
through
received
a
severe
shock
to
his
nerves
norah
enveloped
in
a
huge
apron
was
energetically
polishing
the
kitchen
tins
the
boys
in
their
were
equally
busy
wally
scrubbing
the
sink
with
monkey
soap
and
jim
blackleading
the
stove
it
was
very
clear
that
work
was
no
new
thing
to
any
of
the
trio
allenby
gasped
with
horror
officers
too
he
ejaculated
what
the
world
coming
to
i
wonder
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
walked
round
to
the
back
door
may
i
come
in
please
miss
oh

allenby
norah
said
a
little
confused
we

norah

wally
cheerfully

this
sink
now
allenby
did
you
ever
see
anything
better
it
it
not
right
murmured
allenby
unhappily
he
threw
off
his
black
coat
suddenly
and
advanced
upon
jim
if
you
please
sir
finish
that
stove
that
you
wo
said
jim
thanks
all
the
same
allenby
but
getting
used
to
it
now
he
laughed
besides
do
you
forget
that
you
a
butler
i
ca
forget
that
you
an
officer
sir
said
allenby
wretchedly
it
not
right

of
the
regiment
and
miss
norah
wo
you
let
me
sir
you
can
clean
the
paint
allenby
said
norah
taking
pity
on
his
distressed
face
but
there
really
no
need
to
keep
you
if
you
only
not
mind
telling
any
of
them
at
the
what
i
was
doing
said
the
butler
anxiously
it
undermine
me
position
there
that
miss
de
lisle
now
she
looks
down
on
everybody
enough
without
knowin
i
was
doin
any
job
like
this
she
shall
never
know
said
jim
tragically
waving
a
blacklead
brush
now
i
off
to
do
the
grate
if
you
deadly
anxious
to
work
allenby
you
could
wash
this
floor
could
he
norah
thanks
very
much
sir
said
allenby
gratefully
i
leave
this
place
all
right
just
shut
the
door
sir
and
do
you
bother
about
it
any
more
however
did
you
dare
jim
breathed
norah
as
the
cleaning
party
moved
towards
the
do
you
think
a
butler
ever
washed
a
floor
before
ca
say
said
jim
easily
i
regarding
him
more
as
a
sergeant
than
a
butler
for
the
moment
not
that
i
can
remember
seeing
a
sergeant
wash
a
floor
either
but
he
seemed
anxious
to
help
so
why
not
let
him
it
wo
hurt
him
he
getting
disgracefully
fat
and
there
plenty
to
do
heaps
said
wally
cheerily
where
that
nor
these
boards
want
a
rub
what
are
you
going
to
do
polish
brass
said
norah
beginning
on
a
when
i
grow
up
i
think
i
be
an
architect
and
then
i
make
the
sort
of
house
that
women
will
care
to
live
in
what
sort
that
asked
jim
i
do
know
what
the
outside
will
be
like
but
it
wo
have
any
brass
to
keep
clean
or
any
with
pretty
tops
to
catch
dust
or
any
corners
in
the
rooms
brownie
and
i
used
to
talk
about
it
all
the
cupboards
will
be
built
in
so
no
dust
can
get
under
them
and
the
windows
will
have
some
patent
dodge
to
open
inwards
when
they
want
cleaning
and
there
be
washstands
in
every
room
with
taps
and
plugs
brass
taps
queried
wally
certainly
not
what
then
oh
something
something
that
does
need
to
be
kept
pretty
and
then
there
will
be
heaps
of
and
heaps
of
only
all
the
shelves
will
be
narrow
so
that
nothing
can
be
put
behind
anything
else
whatever
do
you
mean
asked
jim
she
means
dead
mice
you
know
they
get
behind
bottles
of
jam
said
wally
kindly
go
on
nor
you
talk
like
a
book
well
dead
mice
are
as
good
as
anything
said
norah
lucidly
there
wo
be
any
room
for
their
corpses
on
shelves
and
i
have
some
arrangement
for
supplying
hot
water
through
the
house
that
does
depend
on
keeping
a
huge
kitchen
fire
alight
that
a
good
notion
said
jim
sitting
back
on
his
heels
blacklead
brush
in
hand
i
think
i
go
architecting
with
you
nor
we
go
in
for
all
sorts
of
electric
dodges
plugs
in
all
the
rooms
to
fix
to
vacuum
cleaners
you
can
work
with
one
hand
most
of
want
two
men
and
a
boy
and
electric
and
cookers
and
fans
and
all
kinds
of
things
and
everybody
will
be
using
them
so
electricity
will
have
to
be
cheap
i
really
could
help
listening
to
you
said
a
deep
voice
in
the
doorway
every
one
jumped
it
was
miss
de
lisle
in
her
skimpy
red
overall
rather
more
flushed
than
usual
and
a
little
embarrassed
i
hope
you
do
mind
she
said
i
heard
voices
and
i
think
any
one
lived
here
i
knocked
but
you
were
all
so
busy
you
did
hear
me
so
busy
talking
you
mean
laughed
wally
terrible
chatterboxes
jim
and
norah
they
never
get
any
work
done
a
blacklead
brush
hurtled
across
the
room
he
caught
it
neatly
and
returned
it
to
the
owner
but
you
working
terribly
hard
said
the
in
bewilderment
is
any
one
going
to
live
here
norah
explained
briefly
miss
de
lisle
listened
with
interest
nodding
her
head
from
time
to
time
it
a
beautiful
idea
she
said
at
length
fancy
now
you
rescuing
those
poor
little
children
and
their
father
and
mother
it
makes
me
feel
quite
sentimental
most
cooks
are
sentimental
you
know
such
a
a
warm
occupation
she
added
vaguely
when
i
cooking
something
that
requires
particular
care
i
always
find
myself
crooning
a
love
song
at
which
wally
collapsed
into
such
a
hopeless
giggle
that
jim
and
norah
in
little
better
case
themselves
looked
at
him
in
horror
expecting
to
see
him
annihilated
to
their
relief
miss
de
lisle
grinned
cheerfully
oh
yes
you
may
laugh
she
said
whereupon
they
all
did
i
know
i
do
look
sentimental
perhaps
it
just
as
well
nobody
would
want
a
cook
with
golden
hair
and
languishing
blue
eyes
and
i
do
cook
so
much
better
than
i
sing
now
i
going
to
help
what
can
i
do
indeed
you
not
said
norah
thanks
ever
so
miss
de
lisle
but
we
can
manage
quite
well
now
you
thinking
of
what
i
said
the
other
day
said
miss
de
lisle
disgustedly
i
know
i
did
say
my
province
was
cooking
and
nothing
else
but
if
you
knew
the
places
i
struck
dear
me
there
was
one
place
where
the
footman
chucked
me
under
the
chin
it
was
too
much
for
the
others
they
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
shrieked
in
unison
yes
i
know
it
funny
said
miss
de
lisle
i
howled
myself
after
it
was
all
over
but
i
do
think
the
footman
ever
chucked
any
one
under
the
chin
again
i
settled
him
there
was
a
reminiscent
gleam
in
her
eye
norah
felt
a
flash
of
sympathy
for
the
hapless
footman
then
there
was
another
house
that
was
a
duke
where
the
butler
expected
me
to
walk
out
with
him
that
the
worst
of
it
if
you
behave
like
a
human
being
you
get
that
sort
of
thing
and
if
you
you
a
pig
and
treated
accordingly
she
looked
at
them
whimsically
please
do
think
me
a
pig
she
said
i
i
shall
never
forget
how
you
held
the
door
open
for
me
mr
jim
oh
i
say
do
protested
the
unhappy
jim
turning
scarlet
now
you
afraid
i
going
to
be
sentimental
but
i
not
going
to
polish
the
boards
in
the
passage
and
then
you
can
give
me
another
job
lunch
is
cold
i
done
all
the
cooking
now
please
do
as
norah
began
to
protest
dear
me
if
you
only
knew
how
nice
it
is
to
speak
to
some
one
again
she
swooped
upon
tin
of
scooped
half
of
its
contents
into
the
lid
with
a
commandeered
two
cloths
from
a
basketful
of
cleaning
matters
and
strode
off
from
the
passage
came
a
steady
pounding
that
spoke
of
as
much
as
polish
being
applied
did
you
ever
said
jim
weakly
never
said
wally
i
say
i
think
she
a
good
sort
so
do
i
but
who
have
thought
it
poor
old
soul
said
norah
she
must
be
most
horribly
dull
but
after
our
first
day
i
would
have
dared
to
make
a
remark
to
her
unless
she
condescended
to
address
me
first
i
should
think
you
would
said
wally
but
she
really
quite
human
when
she
tucks
her
claws
in
oh
my
aunt
said
jim
chuckling
i
give
a
month
pay
to
have
seen
the
footman
chuck
her
under
the
chin
they
fell
into
convulsions
of
silent
laughter
from
the
passage
as
they
regained
composure
came
a
broken
melody
punctuated
by
the
dull
pounding
on
the
floor
miss
de
lisle
on
her
knees
had
become
sentimental
and
warbled
as
she
rubbed
do
not
ask
for
the
heart
of
thy
heart
why
would
you
murmured
wally
with
a
rapt
expression
any
one
who
can
make
pikelets
like
you
be
quiet
wally
grinned
jim
she
hear
you
not
she
she
too
happy
listen
that
i
for
is
all
that
may
be
all
that
thou
to
give
unto
me
i
do
not
ask
crash
bang
splash
heavens
what
happened
exclaimed
jim
they
rushed
out
at
the
end
of
the
passage
miss
de
lisle
and
the
irreproachable
allenby
struggled
in
a
heap
in
an
pool
of
water
that
came
from
an
overturned
bucket
lying
a
yard
away
the
family
rushed
to
the
rescue
allenby
got
to
his
feet
as
they
arrived
and
dragged
up
the
drenched
he
was
pale
with
apprehension
i
i
do
beg
your
pardon
mum
he
gasped
i
an
idea
in
me
there
was
any
one
there
least
of
all
you
on
your
knees
i
just
come
backin
out
with
the
bucket
i
say
miss
de
lisle
are
you
hurt
jim
asked
anxiously
not
a
bit
which
is
queer
considering
allenby
weight
returned
miss
de
lisle
but
it
it
just
funny
is
it
she
broke
into
a
shout
of
laughter
and
the
others
who
had
indeed
been
choking
with
repressed
feeling
followed
suit
allenby
after
a
gallant
attempt
to
preserve
the
correct
demeanour
of
a
butler
unchanged
by
any
circumstance
suddenly
bolted
into
the
kitchen
like
a
rabbit
they
heard
strange
sounds
from
the
direction
of
the
sink
but
i
say
you
drenched
said
jim
when
every
one
felt
a
little
better
miss
de
lisle
glanced
at
her
stained
and
dripping
overall
well
a
little
i
take
this
off
she
said
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
appearing
in
a
white
blouse
and
grey
skirt
which
suited
her
very
much
better
than
the
roseate
garment
but
my
floor
and
i
had
it
so
beautifully
polished
she
raised
her
voice
allenby
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
this
floor
indeed
mum
i
made
a
pretty
mess
of
it
said
allenby
reappearing
you
have
indeed
said
she
but
i
never
expected
to
find
you
said
the
bewildered
and
i
certainly
never
expected
to
find
the
butler
scrubbing
retorted
miss
de
lisle
at
which
allenby
jam
dropped
and
he
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
jim
this
is
a
said
jim
promptly
we
all
in
it
and
no
one
else
knows
anything
about
it
not
atkins
i
hope
sir
said
allenby
certainly
not
as
for
sarah
she
out
of
it
altogether
allenby
sighed
a
relieved
butler
i
see
to
the
floor
sir
he
said
it
up
to
me
is
it
and
polish
it
after
i
can
easy
slip
down
for
a
couple
of
hours
after
lunch
when
you
all
out
ridin
then
i
really
had
better
fly
said
miss
de
lisle
i
am
pretty
wet
and
there
lunch
to
think
about
she
looked
at
them
in
friendly
fashion
thank
you
all
very
much
she
said
and
was
gone
with
a
kind
of
elephantine
swiftness
the
family
returned
to
the
leaving
allenby
to
grapple
with
the
swamp
in
the
passage
do
we
have
cheery
adventures
when
we
clean
house
said
wally
happily
i
would
have
missed
this
morning
for
anything
no
it
been
merry
and
bright
jim
agreed
and
is
the
a
i
say
nor
do
you
think
you
find
a
human
side
to
atkins
if
we
let
allenby
fall
over
her
with
a
bucket
of
water
not
said
norah
you
ca
find
what
does
exist
said
wally
wisely
atkins
is
only
a
walking
cruet
sort
of
mixture
of
salt
and
vinegar
they
told
the
story
to
linton
over
the
after
allenby
had
withdrawn
nevertheless
the
butler
listening
from
his
pantry
to
the
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
had
a
fairly
good
idea
of
the
subject
under
discussion
and
became
rather
pink
it
lovely
in
another
way
norah
finished
for
you
see
i
thought
miss
de
lisle
was
human
but
i
was
all
wrong
she
rather
a
dear
when
you
come
to
know
her
yes
said
her
father
thoughtfully
but
you
have
to
be
careful
norah
you
must
make
any
distinctions
between
her
and
atkins
it
does
matter
if
miss
de
lisle
pedigree
is
full
of
dukes
and
bishops
atkins
is
the
upper
servant
and
she
resent
it
if
you
put
miss
de
lisle
on
a
different
footing
to
herself
yes
i
see
said
norah
nodding
i
do
my
best
dad
miss
de
lisle
however
played
the
game
she
did
not
encounter
norah
often
and
when
she
did
it
was
in
atkins
presence
and
on
these
occasions
she
maintained
an
attitude
of
impersonal
politeness
which
made
it
hard
to
realize
that
she
and
the
butler
had
indeed
bathed
together
on
the
floor
of
the
cottage
she
found
various
matters
in
her
little
an
a
flowering
a
pile
of
books
that
bore
norah
name
or
jim
but
she
made
no
sign
of
having
received
them
except
that
norah
found
on
her
table
at
night
a
twisted
note
in
a
masculine
hand
that
said
thank
c
de
as
for
atkins
she
made
her
silent
way
about
the
house
sour
and
watchful
her
green
eyes
rather
resembling
those
of
a
cat
and
her
step
as
stealthy
norah
tried
hard
to
talk
to
her
on
other
matters
than
housekeeping
but
found
her
so
stolidly
unresponsive
that
at
last
she
gave
up
the
attempt
life
as
she
said
to
wally
was
too
short
to
woo
a
the
week
flew
by
swiftly
every
moment
busy
with
work
and
plans
for
the
tired
people
to
come
atkins
it
was
plain
did
not
like
the
scheme
she
mentioned
that
it
would
make
a
great
deal
of
work
and
how
did
norah
expect
servants
in
these
days
to
put
up
with
unexpected
people
coming
at
all
sorts
of
hours
but
said
norah
that
what
the
house
is
my
father
and
i
would
not
want
a
houseful
of
servants
if
we
did
mean
to
have
a
houseful
of
people
what
would
we
do
with
you
all
at
which
atkins
sniffed
and
replied
haughtily
that
she
had
been
in
a
place
where
there
was
only
one
lady
and
kept
eleven
servants
more
shame
for
her
said
norah
anyhow
we
explained
it
all
to
you
when
we
engaged
you
atkins
if
we
were
going
to
have
people
here
we
should
still
be
living
in
london
in
a
flat
and
if
the
servants
wo
do
their
work
we
shall
just
have
to
get
others
who
will
which
was
a
terrible
effort
of
firmness
for
poor
norah
who
inwardly
hoped
that
atkins
did
not
realize
that
she
was
shaking
in
her
shoes
easier
said
than
done
in
said
the
housekeeper
morosely
servants
do
grow
on
now
and
what
they
expect
well
do
know
what
the
world
coming
to
but
norah
feeling
unequal
to
more
fled
and
being
discovered
by
wally
and
jim
with
her
head
in
her
hands
over
an
was
promptly
taken
out
on
killaloe
the
boys
riding
the
cobs
which
they
untruthfully
persisted
that
they
preferred
then
came
tuesday
morning
with
early
breakfast
and
the
boys
once
more
in
khaki
and
jones
in
the
carriage
keeping
the
browns
moving
in
the
chill
air
not
such
a
hard
parting
as
others
they
had
known
since
for
the
present
there
was
no
anxiety
but
from
the
days
when
jim
used
to
leave
billabong
for
his
melbourne
morning
had
been
a
difficult
one
for
the
lintons
they
joked
through
it
in
their
usual
way
it
was
part
of
the
family
creed
to
keep
the
flag
flying
well
you
may
have
us
back
at
any
time
as
your
first
tired
people
said
wally
his
keen
face
looking
as
though
it
never
could
grow
weary
courses
must
be
very
fatiguing
do
you
think
jim
poor
dears
said
norah
feelingly
we
have
a
special
diet
for
you
and
will
they
send
you
in
an
ambulance
very
likely
and
then
you
be
sorry
you
were
so
disrespectful
wo
she
mr
linton
i
afraid
you
ca
count
on
it
said
that
gentleman
laughing
norah
bump
of
respect
is
highly
developed
even
for
me
write
soon
jim
and
tell
us
how
you
get
on
and
what
your
next
movements
are
rather
answered
jim
do
let
the
lady
of
the
house
wear
off
all
her
curls
over
the
accounts
will
you
dad
i
hate
to
see
her
bald
i
keep
an
eye
on
her
said
his
father
now
boys
it
time
you
were
off
they
shook
hands
with
allenby
to
his
secret
gratification
he
closed
the
carriage
door
upon
them
and
stood
back
at
attention
as
they
drove
off
from
an
upper
window
unseen
unfortunately
a
figure
in
a
red
overall
leaned
waving
a
handkerchief
the
train
was
late
and
they
all
stamped
about
the
platform
it
was
a
frosty
morning
buck
up
old
kiddie
said
jim
we
be
home
in
no
time
and
look
after
dad
yes
rather
said
norah
send
me
all
your
socks
when
they
want
darning
which
is
every
week
right
they
looked
at
each
other
with
the
blank
feeling
of
having
nothing
to
say
that
comes
on
station
platforms
or
on
the
decks
of
ships
before
the
final
bell
rings
then
the
train
came
in
sight
the
elderly
porter
expectant
of
a
tip
bustled
mightily
with
and
and
presently
they
were
gone
the
two
brown
faces
hung
out
of
the
until
the
train
disappeared
round
a
curve
norah
and
her
father
looked
at
each
other
well
my
girl
said
he
now
i
suppose
we
had
better
begin
our
job
they
went
out
to
the
carriage
just
as
they
were
getting
in
the
ancient
porter
hurried
after
them
there
some
people
come
by
that
train
for
you
sir
the
lintons
turned
a
thin
man
with
sad
irish
eyes
was
limping
out
of
the
station
behind
him
came
two
girls
why
it
con
norah
cried
it
is
miss
said
the
chauffeur
and
the
gerrls
i
have
with
me
bridie
and
katty
but
you
did
write
linton
said
well
indeed
i
was
that
rushed
an
we
gettin
off
said
con
but
i
give
patsy
burke
the
money
and
towld
him
to
send
the
wire
but
is
the
way
with
patsy
he
likely
think
it
do
in
a
day
or
two
as
well
as
any
time
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
telegram
duly
arrived
three
days
later
by
which
time
the
new
arrivals
had
shaken
down
and
there
seemed
some
prospect
of
domestic
peace
in
the
home
for
tired
people
chapter
vi
kidnapping
hunt
came
slowly
down
the
steps
of
a
park
lane
mansion
now
used
as
an
officers
hospital
she
was
tired
and
dispirited
her
steps
dragged
as
she
made
her
way
towards
piccadilly
beneath
her
veil
her
pretty
face
showed
white
with
lines
of
anxiety
deepening
it
an
officer
hurrying
by
stopped
and
came
eagerly
to
speak
to
her
how
are
you
hunt
and
how
the
major
not
very
well
said
hunt
answering
the
second
part
of
the
question
the
operation
was
more
successful
than
any
he
has
had
yet
but
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
pain
and
he
does
seem
to
pick
up
strength
the
doctors
say
that
his
hand
now
depends
a
good
deal
upon
his
general
health
he
ought
to
live
in
the
country
forget
that
there
a
war
on
and
get
thoroughly
fit
she
sighed
it
so
easy
for
doctors
to
prescribe
these
little
things
yes
they
all
do
it
said
the
other
a
captain
in
major
regiment
may
i
go
to
see
him
do
you
think
oh
do
hunt
answered
it
will
cheer
him
up
and
anything
that
will
do
that
is
good
he
terribly
depressed
poor
old
boy
she
said
and
went
on
wearily
it
was
a
warm
afternoon
for
october
norah
linton
and
her
father
had
come
up
to
london
by
an
early
train
and
after
much
shopping
had
lunched
at
a
little
french
restaurant
in
soho
where
they
ate
queer
dishes
and
talked
exceedingly
bad
french
to
the
pretty
waitress
it
was
four
when
they
found
themselves
at
the
door
of
a
dingy
building
in
bloomsbury
floor
the
hunts
flat
daddy
said
norah
consulting
a
i
suppose
there
is
a
lift
there
was
a
lift
but
it
was
out
of
order
a
grimy
card
tucked
into
the
lattice
of
the
doorway
proclaimed
the
fact
so
they
mounted
flight
after
flight
of
stairs
and
finally
halted
before
a
doorway
bearing
major
hunt
card
a
slatternly
maid
answered
their
ring
hunt
out
she
said
curtly
gorn
to
see
the
mijor
oh
will
she
be
long
do
think
so
she
home
about
four
will
yer
wait
norah
looked
at
her
father
oh
yes
we
wait
he
said
they
followed
the
girl
into
a
narrow
passage
close
and
airless
and
smelling
of
irish
stew
sounds
of
warfare
came
from
behind
a
closed
door
a
child
began
to
cry
loudly
and
a
boy
voice
was
heard
angry
and
tired
the
maid
ushered
the
visitors
into
a
dingy
little
norah
stopped
her
as
she
was
departing
could
i
see
the
children
the
girl
hesitated
they
a
bit
untidy
she
said
sullenly
i
ai
had
no
time
to
clean
up
there
ai
no
one
to
take
them
for
a
walk
oh
never
mind
how
untidy
they
are
said
norah
hastily
do
send
them
in
oh
all
right
said
the
girl
you
tell
the
missus
it
was
you
arsked
for
wo
yer
yes
of
course
she
went
out
and
the
lintons
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
the
hopeless
little
room
the
furniture
was
black
horsehair
very
shiny
and
hard
and
slippery
there
was
a
gimcrack
bamboo
overmantel
with
much
speckled
glass
and
the
pictures
were
of
the
kind
peculiar
to
london
apt
to
promote
indigestion
in
the
beholder
there
was
one
little
window
looking
out
upon
a
blank
courtyard
and
a
dirty
little
where
children
played
and
fought
incessantly
and
stray
curs
nosed
the
rubbish
in
the
gutters
in
the
hope
of
finding
food
there
was
nothing
green
to
be
seen
nothing
clean
nothing
pleasant
oh
poor
kiddies
said
norah
under
her
breath
the
door
opened
and
they
came
in
not
shyly
the
london
child
is
seldom
shy
but
frankly
curious
and
in
the
case
of
the
elder
two
with
suspicion
three
mites
as
children
well
may
be
who
have
spent
a
london
summer
in
a
bloomsbury
square
where
the
very
pavements
sweat
tar
and
the
breathless
sticky
heat
is
as
cruel
by
night
as
by
day
a
boy
of
six
straight
and
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
who
held
by
the
hand
a
small
toddling
person
with
damp
rings
of
golden
hair
behind
them
a
slender
little
girl
a
little
too
shadowy
for
a
mother
heart
to
be
easy
with
big
brown
eyes
peeping
elfishly
from
a
cloud
of
brown
curls
the
boy
spoke
sullenly
eva
told
us
to
come
in
he
said
we
wanted
you
to
take
care
of
us
said
norah
you
see
your
mother
is
here
but
we
ca
have
tea
said
the
boy
eva
says
she
is
cleaned
up
yet
and
besides
there
no
milk
and
very
likely
mother
forget
the
cakes
she
said
but
we
do
want
tea
said
norah
we
had
a
big
lunch
not
so
long
ago
and
besides
we
got
something
nicer
than
tea
it
in
his
pocket
she
nodded
at
her
father
who
suddenly
smiled
in
the
way
that
made
every
child
love
him
and
fishing
in
his
pocket
drew
out
a
square
white
box
at
sight
of
which
the
baby
said
delightedly
choc
and
a
kind
of
incredulous
wonder
rather
pitiful
to
see
came
into
the
eyes
of
geoffrey
and
his
sister
there
a
very
difficult
red
ribbon
on
this
said
linton
fumbling
with
it
i
ca
undo
it
he
smiled
at
little
alison
you
show
me
how
she
was
across
the
room
in
a
flash
the
baby
at
her
heels
while
geoffrey
made
a
slow
step
or
two
and
then
stopped
again
but
you
do
undone
it
she
said
it
sticks
on
top
you
breaks
this
paper
pointing
to
the
seal
and
then
it
undones
himself
you
quite
right
said
linton
as
the
lid
came
off
so
it
does
how
did
you
know
we
did
have
lots
of
boxes
when
we
lived
with
the
wegiment
said
the
small
girl
but
now
the
wegiment
in
fwance
and
daddy
does
have
enough
pennies
for
chocs
her
busy
fingers
tossed
aside
tissue
paper
and
silver
wrapping
until
the
brown
rows
of
sweets
were
revealed
then
she
put
her
hands
by
her
sides
is
we
to
have
some
oh
you
poor
little
soul
said
david
linton
hurriedly
and
caught
her
up
on
his
knee
he
held
the
box
in
front
of
her
now
which
sort
do
you
think
is
best
for
weeshy
boys
like
that
he
asked
indicating
the
baby
who
was
making
silent
dives
in
the
direction
of
the
box
and
which
do
you
like
and
geoffrey
michael
likes
these
she
fished
one
out
carefully
and
michael
fell
upon
it
sitting
on
the
carpet
that
he
might
devour
it
at
his
ease
and
geoff
and
me
oh
we
likes
any
then
you
shall
have
any
at
all
he
held
out
his
free
hand
come
on
geoff
and
the
boy
who
had
hesitated
digging
one
foot
into
the
carpet
suddenly
capitulated
and
came
are
you
an
officer
he
asked
presently
no
i
too
old
said
david
linton
but
i
have
a
big
son
who
is
one
and
another
boy
too
what
their
regiment
the
same
as
your
father
truly
a
sparkle
came
into
the
boy
eyes
i
going
to
be
in
it
some
day
of
course
you
will
and
michael
too
i
suppose
and
then
fight
the
germans
that
is
if
there
are
any
left
daddy
says
there
wo
be
but
i
keep
hoping
there

just
a
few
for
me
and
michael
alison
wants
some
too
said
that
lady
wants
to
kill
vem
wiv
my
wevolver
a
nice
young
you
are
said
linton
laughing
girls
ca
kill
germans
silly
said
geoffrey
scornfully
they
have
to
stop
at
home
and
make
bandages
to
which
his
sister
replied
calmly
sha
i
going
to
kill
forty
with
an
air
of
finality
which
seemed
to
end
the
discussion
norah
checked
any
further
warlike
reflections
by
finding
a
new
layer
of
sweets
as
attractive
as
those
on
top
and
the
three
heads
clustered
over
the
box
in
a
pleasant
anxiety
of
selection
the
carriages
on
the
tube
railway
had
been
very
stuffy
that
afternoon
hunt
emerged
thankfully
from
the
crowded
lift
which
shot
up
the
passengers
from
underground
she
came
with
slow
step
into
the
dusty
street
the
flat
was
not
far
away
that
was
one
comfort
but
she
sighed
impatiently
as
she
entered
the
building
to
be
confronted
with
the
not
working
legend
on
the
lift
little
wretch
she
said
alluding
to
the
absent
i
sure
he
only
playing
round
the
corner
she
toiled
up
the
three
long
flights
of
stairs
her
dainty
soul
revolting
at
their
unswept
dinginess
stella
hunt
had
been
brought
up
in
a
big
house
on
a
cumberland
fell
and
there
was
no
day
in
crowded
bloomsbury
when
she
did
not
long
for
the
clean
open
spaces
of
her
girlhood
she
let
herself
into
the
flat
with
her
voices
came
to
her
from
the
with
a
gurgle
of
laughter
from
little
michael
she
frowned
eva
should
not
have
let
the
children
in
there
she
thought
anxiously
they
may
do
some
damage
she
opened
the
door
hurriedly
no
one
noticed
her
for
a
moment
david
linton
with
alison
on
one
knee
and
geoffrey
on
the
other
was
deep
in
a
story
of
on
the
floor
sat
norah
with
michael
tucked
into
her
lap
his
face
blissful
as
she
told
on
his
fat
fingers
the
tale
of
the
little
pigs
who
went
to
market
the
box
of
chocolates
was
on
the
table
its
scarlet
ribbon
making
a
bright
spot
of
colour
in
the
drab
room
the
mother
looked
for
a
minute
in
silence
something
of
the
weariness
dying
out
of
her
eyes
then
geoffrey
looked
up
and
saw
her
a
slight
figure
holding
a
paper
bag
hallo
he
said
i
glad
you
did
forget
the
cakes
got
people
to
tea
linton
placed
his
burden
on
the
hearthrug
and
got
up
how
are
you
hunt
i
hope
you
do
mind
our
taking
possession
like
this
we
wanted
to
get
acquainted
i
could
wish
they
were
cleaner
said
hunt
laughing
as
she
shook
hands
i
seldom
seen
three
grubbier
people
geoff
dear
could
eva
have
washed
your
face
she
said
she
had
time
said
geoffrey
easily
we
tried
to
wash
michael
but
he
only
got
more
streaky
oh
please
do
mind
hunt
norah
pleaded
they

such
darlings
i
afraid
i
do
mind
at
all
said
hunt
sitting
down
thankfully
i
been
picturing
my
poor
babies
tired
to
death
of
not
being
out
and
then
to
come
home
and
find
them
in
the
seventh
heaven
she
broke
off
her
lip
quivering
a
little
you
just
as
tired
as
you
can
be
said
norah
now

going
to
rest
and
geoff
will
show
me
how
to
get
tea

could
let
you

awful
little
kitchen
said
hunt
hastily
and
besides
i
awfully
sorry

do
believe
the
milkman
has
been
yet
i
could
go
to
the
round
the
corner

geoffrey
anxiously

i
ask
eva

tea

oh
of
course
she
said
hunt
ceasing
to
argue
the
point
but
she
never
fit
to
be
seen
that
does
matter
said
david
linton
masterfully
we
seen
her
once
and
survived
the
shock
just
put
your
feet
up
and
tell
me
all
about
your
husband
norah

see
to
things
eva
however
was
found
to
have
risen
to
the
situation
she
had
used
soap
and
water
with
surprising
effect
and
now
bloomed
in
a
fresh
cap
and
an
apron
that
had
plainly
done
duty
a
good
many
times
but
being
turned
inside
out
still
presented
a
decent
front
to
the
world
she
scorned
help
in
preparing
tea
but
graciously
permitted
norah
to
wash
the
three
children
and
brush
their
hair
and
indicated
where
clean
overalls
might
be
found
then
escorted
by
all
three
norah
sallied
forth
jug
in
hand
and
found
not
only
the
but
another
where
cakes
and
scones
so
clamoured
to
be
bought
that
they
all
returned
laden
with
paper
bags
eva
had
made
a
huge
plate
of
buttered
toast
so
that
the
meal
which
presently
made
its
appearance
on
the
big
table
in
the
might
well
have
justified
the
query
as
to
whether
indeed
a
war
were
in
progress
hunt
laughed
rather
mirthlessly
i
suppose
i
ought
to
protest
but
i
too
tired
she
said
and
it
is
very
nice
to
be
taken
care
of
again
michael
you
should
have
first
vere
is
any
said
alison
with
triumph
norah
was
tucking
a
feeder
under
michael
fat
chin
now
he
my
boy
for
a
bit
not
yours
at
all
hunt
she
said
laughing
forget
them
all
i
going
to
be
head
nurse
and
hunt
lay
back
thankfully
and
submitted
to
be
waited
on
while
the
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
smoothed
away
a
few
more
lines
from
her
face
and
made
even
eva
feasting
on
unaccustomed
cakes
in
the
kitchen
smile
grimly
and
murmur
lor
ai
they
a
time
not
until
tea
was
over
and
the
children
busy
with
picture
books
that
had
come
mysteriously
from
another
of
his
pockets
did
david
linton
unfold
his
plan
and
then
he
did
it
somewhat
nervously
we
want
to
take
you
all
out
of
this
hunt
he
said
there
a
little
cottage
a
jolly
little
thatched
place
close
to
our
house
that
is
simply
clamouring
to
have
you
all
come
and
live
in
it
i
think
it
will
hold
you
all
comfortably
will
you
come
hunt
flushed
do
talk
to
poor
bloomsbury
people
of
such
heavenly
things
as
thatched
cottages
she
said
we
have
this
horrible
abode
on
a
long
lease
and
i
do
see
any
chance
of
leaving
it
oh
never
mind
the
lease
we
it
for
you
said
linton
he
told
her
briefly
of
john
bequest
to
norah
i
want
you
to
put
it
out
of
your
head
that
you
accepting
the
slightest
favour
he
went
on
we
feel
that
we
only
hold
the
place
in
trust
the
cottage
is
there
empty
and
indeed
it
is
you
who
will
be
doing
us
the
favour
by
coming
to
live
in
it
oh
i
could
she
said
breathlessly
just
think
of
it
mrs
hunt
norah
knelt
down
by
the
hard
little
horsehair
sofa
there
a
big
lawn
in
front
and
a
where
the
babies
could
play
and
a
big
empty
attic
for
them
on
wet
days
and
heaps
of
fresh
milk
and
you
could
keep
chickens
and
the
catches
all
the
sun
and
when
major
hunt
comes
out
of
the
hospital
it
would
be
so
quiet
and
peaceful
he
could
lie
out
under
the
trees
on
fine
days
on
a
rush
lounge
and
there
are
jolly
woods
for
him
to
walk
in
the
poor
wife
caught
her
breath
and
he
be
such
tremendous
company
for
dad
and
i
know
you
help
me
when
i
got
into
difficulties
with
my
there
a
little
stream
and
a
tiny
lake
and
when
is
we
goin
muvver
the
question
was
alison
put
with
calm
certainty
she
and
geoffrey
had
stolen
near
and
were
listening
with
eager
faces
oh
my
darling
i
afraid
we
ca
said
hunt
tremulously
but
the
big
girl

geoffrey
very
low
away
from
he
caught
her
hand
oh

david
linton
said
the
only
question
is

ready
douglas
is
terribly
proud
hunt
said
i
am
afraid
i
be
proud
but
he
will
never
accept
a
favour
i
know
it
would
be
no
use
to
ask
him
then
we
wo
ask
him
said
david
linton
calmly
when
does
he
leave
the
hospital
this
day
week
if
he
is
well
enough
then
we
have
you
comfortably
installed
long
before
that
we
tell
him
a
thing
about
it
on
the
day
he
to
come
out
i
go
for
him
in
the
motor
and
whisk
him
down
to
homewood
before
he
realizes
where
he
going
now
be
sensible
hunt
as
she
tried
to
speak
you
know
what
his
state
is
how
anxious
you
are
you
told
me
all
about
it
just
now
can
you
in
justice
to
him
refuse
to
come
can
you
face
bringing
him
back
here
geoffrey
suddenly
burst
into
sobs
oh
do
mother
he
choked
you
know
how
he
hates
it
and
trees
and
grass
and
woods
and
he
hid
his
face
on
her
arm
an
tsickens
said
alison
an
ackits
to
play
in
you
in
a
hopeless
minority
you
see
hunt
said
linton
you
have
to
give
in
hunt
put
her
arms
round
the
two
children
who
were
pressing
against
her
in
their
eagerness
whereupon
michael
raised
a
wrathful
howl
and
flung
himself
bodily
upon
them
ejaculating
wants
to
be
hugged
too
over
the
three
heads
the
mother
looked
up
at
her
visitors
yes
i
give
in
she
said
i
not
brave
enough
not
to
but
i
do
know
what
douglas
will
say
i
attend
to
douglas
said
linton
cheerfully
now
how
soon
can
you
come
he
frowned
severely
there
to
be
no
question
of
here
i
put
in
people
to
do
that
you
have
your
husband
to
nurse
next
week
and
i
wo
have
you
tiring
yourself
out
beforehand
so
you
have
only
to
pack
look
hunt
norah
was
flushed
with
another
brilliant
idea
let
us
take
the
babies
down
i
sure
they
will
come
with
me
then
you
and
eva
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
pack
up
your
things
oh
i
could
hunt
began
ah

could
she
turned
to
the
children
geoff
will
you
all
come
with
my
daddy
and
me
and
get
the
cottage
ready
for
mother
geoffrey
hesitated
would
you
come
soon
mother
i
i
believe
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
i
could
leave
the
flat
hunt
said
submitting
would
you
all
be
happy
geoff
and
very
good
yes
if
you
hurry

and
come
you
be
a
good
kid
alison
you
said
alison

tsickens

so
many
norah
said
and
michael
will
be
a
darling
and
all
sleep
together
in
one
big
room
and
have
you
had
certainly
better
come
soon
before
your
family
manners
become
ruined
hunt
said
linton
laughing
then
you
can
really
manage
to
get
away
very
well
i
call
for
you
about
five
if
that
will
do
yes
that
will
give
me
time
to
see
douglas
first
but
you
wo
tell
him
anything
oh
no
he
would
only
worry
of
course
linton
i
shall
be
able
to
get
up
to
see
him
every
day
we
less
than
an
hour
by
rail
he
told
her
and
the
trains
are
good
now
i
think
you
had
better
pack
up
those
youngsters
and
get
a
taxi
norah
helped
to
pack
the
little
clothes
trying
hard
to
remember
instructions
as
to
food
and
insistence
on
good
manners
oh
i
know
you
spoil
them
said
hunt
resignedly
poor
mites
they
could
do
with
a
bit
of
spoiling
they
have
had
a
dreary
year
but
i
think
they
will
be
good
they
have
been
away
with
my
sister
sometimes
and
she
gives
them
a
good
character
the
children
said
to
their
mother
gaily
enough
the
ride
in
the
motor
was
sufficient
excitement
to
smooth
out
any
momentary
dismay
at
parting
only
geoffrey
sat
up
very
straight
with
his
lips
tightly
pressed
together
he
leaned
from
the
window
norah
gripping
his
coat
anxiously
you
be
to
come
mother
i
promise
she
said
old
son
mother
always
keeps
her
promises
so
it
all
right
he
said
leaning
back
with
a
little
smile
alison
had
no
worries
she
sang
hi
diddle
diddle
loud
and
clear
as
they
rushed
through
the
crowded
streets
when
a
block
in
the
traffic
came
people
on
looked
down
smiling
involuntarily
at
the
piping
voice
coming
from
the
recesses
of
the
taxi
as
for
michael
he
sat
on
norah
knee
and
sucked
his
thumb
in
complete
content
jones
met
them
at
the
end
of
the
little
journey
his
lips
involuntarily
shaped
themselves
to
a
whistle
of
amazement
as
the
party
filed
out
of
the
station
though
to
the
credit
of
his
training
be
it
recorded
that
no
sound
came
geoffrey
caught
his
breath
with
delight
at
the
sight
of
the
brown
cobs
are
they
yours
yes
are
they
dears
responded
norah
the
boy
caught
her
hand
oh
could
i
sit
in
front
and
look
at
them
norah
laughed
could
he
jones
would
you
take
care
of
him
be
as
safe
as
in
a
cradle
miss
norah
said
jones
delightedly
come
on
up
sir
and
i
show
you
to
drive
linton
swung
him
up
smiling
at
the
transfigured
little
face
norah
had
already
got
her
charges
into
the
carriage
a
porter
stowed
away
their
trunk
and
the
horses
trotted
off
through
the
dusk
i
did
ever
want
to
get
out
geoffrey
confided
to
norah
as
they
went
up
the
steps
to
the
open
door
of
homewood
that
kind
man
let
me
hold
the
end
of
the
reins
and
he
says
he
show
me
more
horses
there
a
pony
too
we
teach
you
to
ride
it
said
linton
whereat
geoffrey
gasped
with
joy
and
became
speechless
well
have
you
got
them
all
tucked
up
asked
linton
when
norah
joined
him
in
the
an
hour
later
oh
yes
they
were
so
tired
poor
mites
bride
helped
me
to
bathe
them
and
we
fed
them
all
on
bread
and
milk
with
lots
of
cream
michael
demanded
mummy
but
he
was
too
sleepy
to
worry
much
but
dad
geoff
wants
you
badly
to
say
he
says
his
own
daddy
always
says
it
to
him
when
he
in
bed
would
you
mind
right
said
her
father
he
went
upstairs
with
norah
at
his
heels
and
tiptoed
into
the
big
room
where
two
of
his
three
small
guests
were
already
sleeping
soundly
he
looked
very
tall
as
he
stood
beside
the
little
bed
in
the
corner
geoff
bright
eyes
peeped
up
at
him
it
was
awful
good
of
you
to
come
he
said
sleepily
daddy
does
he
says
night
old
chap
and
god
bless
you
good
night
old
chap
and
god
bless
you
said
david
linton
gravely
he
held
the
small
hand
a
moment
in
his
own
and
then
stooping
brushed
his
forehead
with
his
lips
god
bless
you
said
geoff
drowsy
voice
i
going
going
to
ride
the
pony
his
words
trailed
off
in
sleep
chapter
vii
the
thatched
cottage
but
for
the
narrow
white
beds
you
would
hardly
have
thought
that
the
big
room
was
a
hospital
ward
in
days
before
all
the
world
was
caught
into
a
whirlpool
of
war
it
had
been
a
ballroom
a
famous
painter
had
made
the
vaulted
ceiling
an
exquisite
thing
of
palest
and
laughing
cupids
tumbling
among
and
tendrils
the
white
walls
bore
long
panels
of
the
same
design
there
were
no
fittings
for
light
visible
when
darkness
fell
the
touch
of
a
button
flooded
the
room
with
a
soft
glow
coming
from
some
unseen
source
in
the
carved
cornice
the
shining
floor
bore
heavy
persian
rugs
and
there
were
tables
heaped
with
books
and
magazines
and
the
nurses
who
flitted
in
and
out
were
all
dainty
and
good
to
look
at
all
about
the
room
were
splendid
palms
in
pots
from
giants
twenty
feet
high
to
lesser
ones
the
graceful
leaves
of
which
could
just
catch
the
eye
of
a
tired
man
in
bed
fresh
from
the
grim
ugliness
of
the
trenches
it
was
the
palms
you
saw
as
you
came
in
not
the
beds
here
and
there
among
them
a
good
many
of
the
patients
were
up
this
afternoon
for
this
was
a
ward
for
not
all
were
fully
dressed
they
moved
about
in
or
lay
on
the
sofas
or
played
games
at
the
little
tables
one
man
was
in
uniform
major
hunt
who
sat
in
a
big
chair
near
his
bed
and
from
time
to
time
cast
impatient
glances
at
the
door
wish
we
were
going
to
lose
you
major
said
a
tall
man
in
a
purple
who
came
up
the
ward
with
wonderful
swiftness
considering
that
he
was
on
crutches
but
i
expect
you
keen
to
go
oh
yes
though
i
miss
this
place
major
hunt
cast
an
appreciative
glance
down
the
beautiful
room
it
has
been
great
luck
to
be
here
there
are
not
many
hospitals
like
this
in
england
but
well
even
if
home
is
only
a
beastly
little
flat
in
bloomsbury
it
home
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
back
to
my
wife
and
the
youngsters
i
miss
the
kids
horribly
yes
one
does
said
the
other
i
daresay
i
find
them
something
of
a
crowd
on
wet
days
when
they
ca
get
out
said
major
hunt
laughing
the
flat
is
small
and
my
wretched
nerves
are
all
on
edge
but
i
want
them
badly
for
all
that
and
it
rough
on
my
wife
to
be
so
much
alone
she
has
led
a
kind
of
wandering
life
since
war
broke
out
sometimes
we
been
able
to
have
the
kids
with
us
but
not
always
he
stretched
himself
wearily
gad
how
glad
i
be
when
the
boche
is
hammered
and
we
able
to
have
a
decent
home
again
we
all
like
that
said
the
other
man
i
seen
my
youngsters
twice
in
the
last
year
yes
you
worse
off
than
i
am
said
major
hunt
he
looked
impatiently
towards
the
door
fidgeting
i
wish
stella
would
come
but
when
a
nurse
brought
him
a
summons
presently
and
he
said
to
the
ward
and
went
eagerly
down
to
the
in
an
electric
lift
worked
by
an
earl
daughter
in
a
very
neat
uniform
it
was
not
his
wife
who
awaited
him
in
a
little
but
a
very
tall
man
looking
slightly
apologetic
your
wife
is
perfectly
well
said
david
linton
checking
the
quick
inquiry
that
rose
to
the
soldier
lips
but
i
persuaded
her
to
give
me
the
job
of
calling
for
you
our
car
is
rather
more
comfortable
than
a
taxi
and
the
doctor
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
have
a
little
run
first
major
hunt
tried
not
to
look
disappointed
and
failed
signally
it
awfully
good
of
you
he
said
courteously
but
i
do
believe
i
up
to
much
yet
and
i
rather
keen
on
getting
home
if
you
would
mind
going
there
direct
david
linton
cast
an
appealing
look
at
the
nurse
who
had
accompanied
her
patient
she
rose
to
the
occasion
promptly
now
major
hunt
she
protested
doctor
orders
you
promised
to
take
all
the
exercise
you
could
and
a
run
in
the
car
would
be
the
very
thing
for
you
oh
very
well
major
hunt
voice
was
resigned
david
linton
leaned
towards
him
i
make
it
as
short
as
i
can
he
said
confidentially
they
said
and
emerged
into
park
lane
where
the
big
blue
motor
waited
afraid
you
must
think
me
horribly
rude
said
the
soldier
as
they
started
fact
is
i
very
anxious
to
see
my
youngsters
i
know
why
but
stella
would
bring
them
to
the
hospital
to
see
me
this
last
week
but
it
certainly
jolly
to
be
out
again
he
leaned
back
enjoying
the
comfort
of
the
swift
car
i
suppose
he
hesitated
it
would
be
altogether
too
much
trouble
to
go
round
by
the
flat
and
pick
up
my
wife
and
geoff
they
would
love
a
run
oh
ah
the
flat
yes
the
flat
said
david
linton
a
little
wildly
i
afraid
that
is
we
should
be
too
early
hunt
would
not
expect
us
so
soon
and
she
er
she
meant
to
be
out
with
all
the
children
shopping
fatted
calf
for
the
prodigal
return
do
you
know
awfully
sorry
oh
it
quite
all
right
said
major
hunt
looking
rather
amazed
only
she
does
generally
take
them
all
out
but
of
course
it
does
matter
i
tell
you
what
said
his
host
regaining
his
composure
take
all
of
you
out
hunt
and
the
three
youngsters
as
well
as
yourself
the
car
will
hold
all
major
hunt
thanked
him
rather
wearily
they
sped
on
leaving
the
outskirts
of
london
behind
them
up
and
down
long
suburban
roads
beyond
the
trail
of
until
the
open
country
gleamed
before
them
the
soldier
took
a
long
breath
of
the
sweet
air
gad
it
good
to
see
fields
again
he
said
presently
he
glanced
at
the
watch
on
his
wrist
nearly
time
to
turn
do
you
think
he
said
i
do
want
stella
to
be
waiting
long
very
soon
said
linton
just
a
little
more
country
air
the
chauffeur
has
his
orders
i
wo
keep
you
much
longer
he
racked
his
brains
anxiously
for
a
moment
and
then
plunged
into
a
story
of
australia
a
story
in
which
bushrangers
blacks
and
bushfires
mingled
so
amazingly
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
listen
to
it
having
once
secured
his
hapless
guest
attention
he
managed
to
leave
the
agony
of
invention
and
to
slide
gracefully
to
about
which
it
was
not
necessary
to
invent
anything
major
hunt
became
interested
and
asked
a
few
questions
and
they
were
deep
in
a
comparison
of
the
ways
of
handling
cattle
on
an
australian
run
and
a
texan
ranch
when
the
car
suddenly
turned
in
at
a
pair
of
big
iron
gates
and
whirled
up
a
drive
fringed
with
trees
major
hunt
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
hallo
where
are
we
going
i
have
to
stop
at
a
house
here
for
an
instant
said
linton
just
a
moment
i
wo
keep
you
major
hunt
frowned
he
was
tired
the
car
was
wonderfully
comfortable
but
the
rush
through
the
keen
air
was
wearying
to
a
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
suppressed
irritation
he
wanted
to
be
home
the
thought
of
the
hard
little
sofa
in
the
london
flat
suddenly
became
tempting
he
could
lie
there
and
talk
to
the
children
and
watch
stella
moving
about
now
they
were
miles
into
the
country
long
miles
that
must
be
covered
again
before
he
was
back
in
bloomsbury
he
bit
his
lips
to
restrain
words
that
might
not
seem
courteous
i
should
really
be
very
grateful
if
he
stopped
the
car
had
turned
into
a
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
big
house
away
to
the
right
then
they
turned
a
corner
and
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
with
her
bonnet
almost
poking
into
a
great
clump
of
rhododendrons
there
was
a
thatched
cottage
beside
them
and
round
the
corner
tore
a
small
boy
in
a
sailor
suit
with
his
face
alight
with
a
very
ecstasy
of
welcome
daddy
oh
daddy
geoff
said
major
hunt
amazedly
but
how
i
do
understand
there
were
other
people
coming
round
the
corner
his
wife
tall
and
slender
with
her
eyes
shining
behind
her
norah
linton
with
alison
trotting
beside
her
and
michael
perched
on
one
shoulder
at
sight
of
his
father
michael
drummed
with
his
heels
to
norah
great
discomfort
and
uttered
shrill
squeaks
of
joy
come
on
said
geoffrey
breathlessly
tugging
at
the
door
come
on

all
here

on

said
david
linton
jumping
out

major

present

nice
dream
i
do
understand
anything
how
are
you
miss
linton

said
his
wife
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
her
brave
eyes
were
misty
only
you
home
it
the
loveliest
home
daddy
geoff
hand
was
in
his
father
pulling
him
on
there
tsickens

alison
in
a
high
pipe

a

said
geoffrey
scornfully
come
on
daddy
we
got
such
heaps
to
show
you
somehow
they
found
themselves
indoors
norah
and
her
father
had
disappeared
they
were
all
together
father
mother
and
babies
in
a
big
room
flooded
with
sunlight
a
room
covered
with
a
thick
red
matting
with
heavy
rugs
on
it
a
room
with
big
and
tables
and
a
wide
couch
heaped
with
bright
cushions
drawn
close
to
an
open
casement
there
was
a
fire
of
logs
crackling
cheerily
in
the
wide
fireplace
there
were
their
own
belongings
photographs
books
his
own
and
there
were
flowers
everywhere
smiling
a
greeting
and
silver
sparkled
on
a
a
copper
kettle
bubbled
over
a
and
there
were
his
own
people
clinging
round
him
welcoming
holding
him
wherever
little
hands
could
grasp
the
babies
fresh
clean
even
rosy
his
wife
face
no
longer
tired
and
there
was
no
bloomsbury
anywhere
major
hunt
sat
down
on
the
sofa
disentangled
michael
from
his
leg
and
lifted
him
with
his
good
arm
it
is
a
dream
really
i
suppose
stella
he
said
i
wo
wake
up
presently
i
do
want
to

blessed
reality

steady
alison
darling

his
hand

about
anything
douglas
only
you
home
i
do
even
want
to

questions
said
her
husband
in
the
same
dazed
voice
i
find
one
has
no
curiosity
when
one
suddenly
gets
to
heaven
we
wo
be
going
away
from
heaven
though

we
permanent
residents
she
told
him
laughing
now

quite
comfy
we
all
have
tea
together
tea

confided
alison
to
him
they
cweam
cakes
day
an
the
tsickens
make
weal
eggs
in
nesses
and
i
can
ride
a
pony
daddy
geoffrey
voice
was
quivering
with
pride
he
stood
by
the
couch
an
erect
little
figure
why
he
grown
ever
so
much
said
major
hunt
they
all
grown
you
too
my
little
fat
michael
i
left
babies
in
that
beastly
flat
and
you
too
she
bent
over
him
your
dear
eyes
have
forgotten
the
old
war
he
said
very
low
there
was
a
heavy
knock
at
the
door
entered
eva
resplendent
in
a
butterfly
cap
and
an
apron
so
stiffly
starched
that
it
stood
away
resentfully
from
her
figure
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
could
eva
ever
have
been
called
shy
but
she
had
a
certain
amount
of
awe
for
her
master
and
found
speech
in
his
presence
a
little
difficult
but
on
this
occasion
it
was
evident
that
she
felt
that
something
was
demanded
of
her
she
put
her
burden
of
buttered
toast
on
a
trivet
in
the
fender
and
said
breathlessly
i
see
yer
well
sir
and
this
a
nice
thank
you
eva
yes
said
major
hunt
whereat
the
handmaiden
withdrew
her
heavy
tread
retreating
to
the
kitchen
to
the
accompaniment
of
song
ow
ow
it
a
lovely
war
i
did
know
her
for
a
moment
major
hunt
said
laughing
you
see
she
never
had
less
than
six
smuts
on
her
face
in
bloomsbury
she
transformed
like
all
of
you
in
this
wonderful
dream
tea
is
a
dream
said
his
wife
she
made
it
in
the
silver
and
they
all
fluttered
about
him
persuading
him
to
eat
and
made
his
tea
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
since
all
three
children
insisted
on
getting
as
close
to
him
as
possible
and
he
had
but
one
good
hand
he
did
not
mind
once
as
his
wife
brought
him
a
refilled
cup
she
saw
him
lean
his
face
down
until
it
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
gold
rings
of
michael
hair
it
was
with
some
anxiety
that
norah
and
her
father
went
to
call
on
their
guest
next
morning
what
will
we
do
if
he
and
proud
dad
norah
asked
i
simply
could
part
with
those
babies
now
let
hope
he
wo
be
said
her
father
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
worst
we
could
let
him
pay
us
a
little
rent
for
the
place
we
could
give
the
money
to
the
red
cross
of
course
said
norah
wrinkling
her
nose
expressively
that
would
be
horrid
it
would
spoil
all
the
idea
of
the
place
but
they
found
major
hunt
surprisingly
meek
i
daresay
that
if
you
had
propounded
the
idea
to
me
at
first
i
should
have
said
flatly
he
admitted
but
i
have
the
heart
to
disturb
them
all
now
and
frankly
i
too
thankful
if
you
let
me
pay
you
rent
certainly
not
said
linton
looking
astonished
and
indignant
we
do
run
our
place
on
those
lines
just
put
it
out
of
your
head
that
we
have
anything
to
do
with
it
you
taking
nothing
from
us
only
from
a
man
who
died
very
cheerfully
because
he
was
able
to
do
five
minutes
work
towards
helping
the
war
he
helping
it
still
if
his
money
makes
it
easier
for
fellows
like
you
and
i
believe
wherever
he
is
he
knows
and
is
glad
but
there
are
others
who
may
need
it
more
said
hunt
weakly
if
there
are
i
have
met
them
yet
linton
responded
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
look
there
now
hunt
norah
had
slipped
away
leaving
the
men
to
talk
now
she
came
riding
up
the
broad
gravel
path
across
the
lawn
on
the
black
pony
leading
the
fat
welsh
pony
with
geoffrey
on
his
back
the
small
boy
sat
very
straight
with
his
hands
well
down
his
flushed
little
face
sought
anxiously
for
his
father
at
the
window
major
hunt
uttered
a
delighted
exclamation
i
did
know
my
urchin
was
so
advanced
he
said
well
done
old
son
he
scanned
him
keenly
he
does
sit
too
badly
mr
linton
he
not
likely
to
do
so
with
norah
as
his
teacher
but
norah
says
he
does
need
much
teaching
and
that
he
has
naturally
good
hands
she
proud
of
him
i
think
said
linton
laughing
that
they
have
visions
of
hunting
together
this
winter
i
must
go
out
and
see
him
said
the
father
catching
up
his
cap
linton
watched
him
cross
the
lawn
with
quick
strides
and
turned
to
find
hunt
at
his
elbow
well
he
does
look
much
like
an
invalid
madam
he
said
smiling
he
not
like
the
same
man
she
said
with
grateful
eyes
he
slept
well
and
ate
a
huge
breakfast
even
the
hand
is
less
painful
and
he
so
cheery
oh
i
so
thankful
to
you
for
kidnapping
us
indeed
it
you
that
we
have
to
thank
he
told
her
you
gave
us
our
first
chance
of
beginning
our
job
chapter
viii
assorted
guests
i
beg
your
pardon
is
this
homewood
norah
practising
long
putts
at
a
hole
on
the
far
side
of
the
terrace
turned
with
a
start
the
questioner
was
in
uniform
bearing
a
captain
three
stars
he
was
a
short
young
man
with
a
square
determined
face
yes
this
is
homewood
she
answered
did
you
have
you
come
to
see
my
father
i
wrote
to
him
last
week
the
officer
said
from
france
it
miss
linton
is
it
i
in
your
brother
regiment
my
name
is
garrett
oh
i
heard
jim
speak
of
you
ever
so
many
times
she
cried
she
put
out
her
hand
and
felt
it
taken
in
a
close
grasp
but
we
had
your
letter
dad
would
have
told
me
if
one
had
come
captain
garrett
frowned
what
a
nuisance
he
ejaculated
letters
from
the
front
are
apt
to
take
their
time
but
i
did
think
a
week
would
have
been
long
enough
i
wrote
directly
i
knew
my
leave
was
coming
you
see
your
brother
told
me
he
stopped
awkwardly
intelligence
suddenly
dawned
upon
norah
why
you
a
tired
person
she
exclaimed
beaming
not
at
all
i
assure
you
replied
he
looking
a
trifle
amazed
norah
laughed
i
do
mean
quite
that
she
said
at
least
i
explain
presently
but
you
come
to
stay
have
you
well
your
brother
was
good
enough
to
he
paused
again
yes
of
course
jim
told
you
we
wanted
you
to
come
this
is
the
home
for
tired
people
you
see
we
want
to
get
as
many
of
you
as
we
can
and
make
you
fit
and
you
our
very
first
in
the
house
which
will
make
it
horribly
dull
for
you
indeed
it
wo
said
garrett
gallantly
well
we
do
our
best
for
you
i
so
very
sorry
you
were
met
did
you
leave
your
luggage
at
the
station
yes
you
quite
sure
it
convenient
to
have
me
miss
linton
i
could
easily
go
back
to
london
good
gracious
no
said
norah
why
you
a
godsend
we
justifying
our
name
but
you
be
dull
because
dad
has
gone
to
london
and
there
only
me
norah
grammar
was
never
her
strong
point
and
little
geoff
hunt
was
coming
to
lunch
with
me
will
it
bore
you
very
much
to
have
a
small
boy
here
rather
not
said
garrett
i
like
them
got
some
young
brothers
of
my
own
in
jamaica
well
that
all
right
now
come
in
and
allenby
will
show
you
your
room
the
car
will
bring
your
things
up
when
it
goes
to
meet
dad
norah
had
often
rehearsed
in
her
own
mind
what
she
would
do
when
the
first
tired
person
came
the
rooms
were
all
ready
in
assorted
sizes
allenby
said
norah
had
awful
visions
of
eight
or
ten
guests
arriving
together
and
in
her
own
mind
characterized
the
business
of
allotting
them
to
their
rooms
as
a
nasty
bit
of
drafting
but
the
first
guest
had
tactfully
come
alone
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
deserved
the
blue
room
a
delightful
little
corner
room
looking
south
and
west
with
dainty
blue
hangings
and
and
a
big
couch
that
beckoned
temptingly
to
a
tired
man
captain
garrett
had
had
fourteen
months
in
france
without
a
break
he
had
spent
the
previous
night
in
the
only
pausing
in
london
for
a
hasty
the
blue
room
was
like
a
glimpse
of
heaven
to
him
he
did
not
want
to
leave
it
only
that
downstairs
jim
linton
sister
awaited
him
and
it
appeared
that
the
said
sister
was
a
very
jolly
girl
with
a
smile
like
her
brother
cheerful
grin
and
a
mop
of
brown
curls
framing
a
decidedly
attractive
face
bob
garrett
decided
that
there
were
better
things
than
even
the
blue
room
and
having
thankfully
accepted
allenby
offer
of
a
hot
tub
presently
emerged
from
the
house
much
improved
in
appearance
this
time
norah
was
not
alone
a
small
boy
was
with
her
who
greeted
the
newcomer
with
coolness
and
then
suddenly
fell
upon
him
excitedly
recognizing
the
badge
on
his
collar
you
in
daddy
regiment
he
exclaimed
am
i
garrett
smiled
at
him
who
is
daddy
he
major
hunt
said
geoff
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
new
officer
become
as
eager
as
he
could
have
wished
by
jove
truly
miss
linton
does
major
hunt
live
here
i
give
something
to
see
him
he
lives
just
round
the
corner
of
that
bush
said
norah
laughing
she
indicated
a
big
rhododendron
is
he
at
home
geoff
no
he
gone
to
london
geoff
answered
but
he
be
back
for
tea
then
we
go
and
call
on
hunt
and
ask
her
if
we
may
come
to
tea
norah
said
they
strolled
off
geoff
capering
about
them
i
do
know
hunt
garrett
said
you
see
i
only
joined
the
regiment
when
war
broke
out
i
had
done
a
good
bit
of
training
so
they
gave
me
a
commission
among
the
first
i
did
see
such
a
lot
of
the
major
for
he
was
doing
special
work
in
ireland
for
awhile
but
he
was
a
regular
brick
to
me
we
all
awfully
sick
about
his
being
smashed
up
but
he
going
to
get
better
norah
said
cheerfully
he
ever
so
much
better
now
they
came
out
in
front
of
the
cottage
and
discovered
hunt
playing
with
alison
and
michael
with
alison
much
worried
by
michael
complete
inattention
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
rule
michael
indeed
declined
to
be
hid
and
played
on
a
steady
line
of
his
own
which
consisted
in
toddling
after
his
mother
whenever
she
was
in
sight
and
catching
her
with
shrill
squeaks
of
joy
it
was
perfectly
satisfactory
to
him
but
somewhat
harassing
to
a
stickler
for
detail
hunt
greeted
garrett
warmly
douglas
has
often
talked
about
you
you
from
jamaica
are
you
she
said
he
will
be
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
yes
of
course
you
must
come
to
tea
norah
i
ask
you
to
lunch
only
perfectly
certain
there
is
enough
to
eat
and
geoff
would
be
so
disgusted
at
being
done
out
of
his
lunch
with
you
which
makes
me
think
it
not
really
your
society
he
wants
but
the
fearful
joy
of
allenby
behind
his
chair
i
do
see
why
you
should
try
to
depress
me
norah
laughed
well
we
all
go
for
a
ride
after
lunch
and
get
back
in
time
for
tea
if
you
put
up
with
me
in
a
splashed
habit
the
roads
are
very
muddy
you
ride
i
suppose
captain
garrett
oh
yes
thanks
garrett
answered
it
the
only
fun
i
had
in
france
since
the
battalion
went
back
into
billets
a
benevolent
gunner
used
to
lend
me
a
horse
both
of
us
devoutly
hoping
that
i
would
be
caught
riding
it
was
it
a
nice
horse
geoffrey
demanded
well
you
would
call
it
perfect
old
chap
i
think
it
was
suffering
from
anyhow
it
had
nerves
it
used
to
shake
all
over
when
it
saw
a
he
grinned
or
perhaps
i
did
on
duty
that
horse
was
as
steady
as
old
time
but
when
it
was
alone
it
jumped
out
of
its
skin
at
anything
and
everything
however
it
was
great
exercise
to
ride
it
we
give
him
killaloe
this
afternoon
geoff
said
norah
come
on
and
we
show
him
the
stables
now
they
bade
to
hunt
and
sauntered
towards
the
stables
on
the
way
appeared
a
form
in
a
print
frock
with
flying
cap
and
did
you
want
me
katty
norah
asked
there
a
tallygrum
after
coming
miss
on
a
bicycle
and
the
waiting
norah
knitted
her
brows
over
the
sheet
of
flimsy
paper
there
no
answer
katty
tell
the
boy
she
turned
to
garrett
laughing
you
not
going
to
be
our
only
guest
for
long
dad
says
he
bringing
two
people
down
colonel
and
west
it
exciting
i
have
to
leave
you
to
geoff
while
i
go
and
talk
to
the
housekeeper
geoff
show
captain
garrett

horses

the
stables

said
geoffrey
bursting
with
importance
come
along
captain
garrett
i
let
you
pat
my
pony
if
you
like
atkins
looked
depressed
at
norah
information
dear
me
and
dinner
ordered
for
three
she
said
sourly
it
makes
a
difference
and
of
course
i
really
had
not
reckoned
on
more
than
you
and
mr
linton
i
can
telephone
for
anything
you
want
said
norah
meekly
the
fish
will
not
be
sufficient
said
the
housekeeper
and
other
things
likewise
i
must
talk
to
the
cook
it
would
be
so
much
easier
if
one
knew
earlier
in
the
day
and
rooms
to
get
ready
of
course
the
big
pink
room
with
the
norah
said
oh
i
suppose
the
maids
can
find
time
those
irish
maids
have
no
idea
of
regular
ways
i
found
bride
helping
to
catch
a
fowl
this
morning
when
she
should
have
been
polishing
the
floor
now
i
must
throw
them
out
of
routine
again
norah
suppressed
a
smile
she
had
been
a
spectator
of
the
spirited
chase
after
the
truant
hen
ending
with
the
appearance
of
atkins
full
of
cold
wrath
and
she
had
heard
bride
comment
afterwards
is
it
her
with
her
ould
routheen
yerra
that
one
would
put
a
hand
to
a
hin
and
it
eshcapin
yes
said
atkins
extraordinary
ways
very
untrained
i
must
say
but
you
find
that
they
do
their
work
do
they
norah
asked
oh
after
a
fashion
said
the
housekeeper
with
a
sniff
unwilling
to
admit
that
bride
and
katty
got
through
more
work
in
two
hours
than
sarah
in
a
morning
were
never
unwilling
and
accepted
any
and
every
job
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness
their
ways
are
my
ways
very
well
miss
linton
i
speak
to
the
cook
feeling
somewhat
battered
norah
escaped
in
the
hall
she
met
katty
who
jumped
and
then
broke
into
a
smile
of
relief
i
thought
was
the
ould
thing
hersilf
she
explained
she
ate
the
face
off
me
if
she
found
me
here
again
is
only
yesterday
she
was
explaining
to
me
that
a
kitchenmaid
has
no
business
in
the
hall
at
all
but
bridie
was
tellin
me
ye
the
grandest
ould
head
of
an
irish
elk
here
and
i
thought
i
risk
her
to
get
a
sight
of
it
it
over
there
norah
said
pointing
to
a
mighty
pair
of
horns
on
the
wall
behind
the
girl
katty
looked
at
it
in
silence
it
quare
to
think
of
the
days
when
them
great
things
walked
the
plains
of
ireland
she
said
at
length
thank
you
miss
it
done
me
good
to
see
it
how
are
you
getting
on
katty
norah
asked
yerra
the
best
in
the
world
said
katty
cheerfully
miss
de
lisle
that
kind
to
me
i
be
the
great
cook
some
day
if
i
kape
on
watchin
her
she
not
like
the
fine
english
cooks
i
heard
of
that
no
more
let
you
see
how
they
made
so
much
as
a
pudding
than
they
fly
over
the
moon
is
bridie
has
the
bad
luck
to
be
housemaid
norah
knew
why
and
sighed
there
were
moments
when
her
housekeeper
seemed
a
burden
too
great
to
be
borne
but
allenby
very
pleasant
with
her
and
she
says
wance
you
find
out
that
sarah
is
made
of
wood
she
not
so
bad
she
found
that
out
when
she
let
fly
a
pillow
at
her
and
they
bedmaking
said
katty
with
a
joyous
twinkle
is
herself
had
great
courage
to
do
that
same
had
she
now
miss
she
had
indeed
norah
said
laughing
the
spectacle
of
the
stiff
sarah
overwhelmed
with
a
sudden
pillow
was
indeed
staggering
and
then
have
we
con
to
cheer
us
up
if
we
get
lonely
said
katty
and
misther
jones
and
the
groom
they
very
friendly
and
the
money
we
have
to
send
home
but
you
be
wishful
for
ireland
no
matter
how
happy
you
be
the
telephone
bell
rang
sharply
and
norah
ran
to
answer
it
it
was
jim
that
you
nor
said
his
deep
voice
good
i
in
a
hurry
i
say
can
you
take
in
a
tired
person
norah
gasped
oh
certainly
she
said
grimly
who
is
it
jimmy
not
you
or
wally
no
such
luck
said
her
brother
it
a
chap
i
met
last
night
just
out
of
a
convalescent
home
and
a
bit
down
on
his
luck
his
voice
died
away
in
a
complicated
jumble
of
whir
and
buzz
the
bell
rang
frantically
and
norah
like
thousands
of
other
people
murmured
her
opinion
of
the
telephone
and
all
its
works
are
you
there
she
asked
said
the
telephone
norah
waited
a
little
anxiously
debating
whether
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
ring
up
herself
and
demand
the
last
speaker
or
to
keep
quiet
and
trust
to
jim
to
regain
his
connexion
finally
she
decided
to
ring
and
was
just
about
to
put
down
the
receiver
when
jim
voice
said
are
you
there
in
her
ear
sharply
and
once
more
collapsed
into
a
whir
she
waited
again
in
dead
silence
at
last
she
rang
nothing
happened
so
she
rang
again
number
please
said
a
bored
voice
some
one
was
speaking
to
me
you
cut
me
off
said
norah
frantically
i
been
trying
to
get
you
for
the
last
ten
minutes
you
have
rung
off
said
the
voice
coldly
wait
please
norah
swallowed
her
feelings
and
waited
hallo
hallo
hallo
oh
that
you
norah
said
jim
his
tone
crisp
with
feeling
is
this
an
unspeakable
machine
and
i
due
in
three
minutes
i
must
fly
sure
you
can
have
hardress
he
get
to
you
by
the
are
you
all
well
yes
we
all
right
sorry
i
get
told
off
horribly
if
i
late
norah
hung
up
the
receiver
and
stood
pondering
she
wished
the
telephone
had
not
chosen
to
behave
so
abominably
only
the
day
before
wally
had
rung
her
up
and
had
spent
quite
half
an
hour
in
talking
cheerful
nonsense
without
any
hindrance
at
all
norah
wished
she
knew
a
little
more
about
her
new
case
if
he
were
very
weak
if
special
food
were
needed
it
was
very
provoking
also
there
was
atkins
to
be
faced
not
a
prospect
to
be
put
off
since
like
taking
gregory
powder
the
more
you
looked
at
it
the
worse
it
got
norah
stiffened
her
shoulders
and
marched
off
to
the
room
oh
atkins
she
said
pleasantly
there
another
officer
coming
this
evening
atkins
turned
cold
surprise
in
her
voice
indeed
miss
and
will
that
be
all
do
you
think
i
really
do
know
said
norah
recklessly
that
depends
on
my
father
you
see
oh
may
i
ask
which
room
is
to
be
prepared
the
one
next
captain
garrett
please
i
can
do
it
if
the
maids
are
too
busy
atkins
froze
yet
more
i
should
very
much
rather
you
did
not
miss
thank
you
she
said
just
as
you
like
said
norah
con
can
take
a
message
for
anything
you
want
he
is
going
to
the
station
thank
you
miss
i
have
already
telephoned
for
larger
supplies
said
the
housekeeper
the
conversation
seemed
to
have
ended
so
norah
departed
what
did
she
ever
come
for
she
asked
herself
desperately
if
she
did
want
to
housekeep
why
does
she
go
out
as
a
housekeeper
turning
a
corner
she
met
the
butler
oh
allenby
she
said
we
have
quite
a
houseful
she
told
him
of
the
expected
arrivals
half
expecting
to
see
his
face
fall
allenby
on
the
contrary
beamed
it
be
almost
like
waiting
in
mess
he
said
when
you
used
to
officers
miss
you
ca
get
on
very
well
without
them
he
looked
in
a
fatherly
fashion
at
norah
anxious
face
all
the
arrangements
made
i
suppose
miss
oh
yes
i
think
they
all
right
said
norah
feeling
anything
but
confident
allenby
i
do
know
much
about
managing
things
do
you
think
it
too
much
for
the
house
no
miss
it
is
allenby
said
firmly
just
you
leave
it
all
to
me
and
do
worry
nature
made
some
people
and
they
ca
it
i
see
that
things
are
all
right
and
as
for
dinner
all
that
worries
miss
de
lisle
as
a
rule
is
that
she
ai
got
enough
cooking
to
do
he
bent
the
same
fatherly
glance
on
her
that
evening
as
she
came
into
the
hall
when
the
hoot
of
the
motor
told
that
her
father
and
his
consignment
of
tired
people
were
arriving
norah
had
managed
to
forget
her
troubles
during
the
afternoon
a
long
ride
had
been
followed
by
a
very
cheerful
tea
at
hunt
from
which
she
and
garrett
had
returned
only
in
time
for
norah
to
slip
into
a
white
frock
and
race
downstairs
to
meet
her
guests
she
hoped
vaguely
that
she
looked
less
nervous
than
she
felt
the
hall
door
opened
letting
in
a
breath
of
the
cold
night
air
ah
norah
this
is
my
daughter
west
she
heard
her
voice
and
then
she
was
greeting
a
stout
lady
and
a
officer
dear
me
said
the
lady
i
expected
some
one
grown
up
how
brave
fancy
you
only
what
is
it
a
flapper
and
do
you
hate
us
all
very
much
should
i
sure
over
her
shoulder
norah
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
father
face
set
in
grim
lines
she
checked
a
sudden
wild
desire
to
laugh
and
murmured
something
civil
our
hostess
algernon
said
the
stout
lady
and
norah
shook
hands
with
colonel
west
who
was
short
and
stout
and
pompous
and
said
explosively
haw
delighted
cold
night
what
which
had
the
effect
of
making
his
hostess
absolutely
speechless
somehow
with
the
assistance
of
allenby
and
sarah
the
newcomers
were
drafted
to
their
rooms
and
norah
and
her
father
sought
cover
in
the
you
look
worn
daddy
said
his
daughter
regarding
him
critically
i
feel
it
said
david
linton
he
sank
into
an
armchair
and
felt
hurriedly
for
his
pipe
have
had
a
chance
of
a
smoke
for
hours
they
a
little
trying
i
think
norah
where
did
you
get
them
norah
asked
perching
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
dropping
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
his
head
from
the
hospital
where
the
boys
were
colonel
west
has
been
ill
there
west
says
but
he
does
look
like
it
anyhow
they
hard
up
i
believe
their
home
is
broken
up
and
they
have
five
or
six
children
at
school
and
a
boy
in
gallipoli
they
seemed
very
glad
to
come
well
that
all
right
said
norah
practically
we
ca
expect
to
have
every
one
as
nice
as
the
hunts
but
they
not
the
only
ones
dad
captain
garrett
is
here
and
jim
is
sending
some
one
called
hardress
by
the
unfortunately
the
telephone
did
allow
jim
to
mention
what
he
is
i
hope
he
is
a
brigadier
i
do
see
jim
to
any
extent
with
brigadiers
said
her
father
i
say
this
is
rather
a
shock
four
in
a
day
yes
business
is
looking
up
said
norah
laughing
captain
garrett
is
a
dear
and
he
can
ride
dad
i
had
him
out
on
killaloe
i
a
little
uneasy
about
the
hardress
person
because
he
just
out
of
a
convalescent
home
and
jim
seemed
worried
about
him
but
the
telephone
went
mad
and
jim
was
in
a
hurry
so
i
did
get
any
details
oh
well
we
look
after
him
how
is
the
household
staff
standing
the
invasion
every
one
very
happy
except
atkins
and
she
is
plunged
in
woe
even
sarah
seems
interested
i
have
dared
to
look
at
miss
de
lisle
but
allenby
says
she
is
cheerful
has
atkins
been
unpleasant
well
said
norah
and
laughed
you
would
call
her
exactly
a
bright
spot
in
the
house
but
she
has
seen
to
things
so
that
is
all
that
counts
i
wo
have
that
woman
worry
you
said
linton
firmly
i
wo
have
worried
about
anything
said
norah
do
think
about
atkins
or
you
wo
enjoy
your
tea
and
here
allenby
tea
said
linton
as
the
butler
entered
bearing
a
little
tray
i
thought
i
was
too
late
for
such
a
luxury
but
i
must
say
i
glad
of
it
i
sent
some
upstairs
sir
said
allenby
placing
a
little
table
near
his
master
just
a
little
toast
sir
it
being
so
late
and
if
you
please
miss
miss
de
lisle
would
be
glad
if
you
could
spare
a
moment
in
the
kitchen
the
redder
than
ever
was
mixing
a
mysterious
compound
in
a
bowl
katty
hugely
important
darted
hither
and
thither
a
variety
of
savoury
smells
filled
the
air
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
said
miss
de
lisle
confidentially
that
i
making
a
special
of
my
own
and
allenby
will
put
it
in
front
of
you
promise
me
she
leaned
forward
earnestly
to
use
a
thin
spoon
to
help
it
and
slide
it
in
edgeways
as
gently
as
as
if
you
were
stroking
a
baby
it
just
a
thing
i
sleep
if
you
used
a
heavy
spoon
and
plunged
it
in
as
if
it
was
a
i
wo
forget
norah
promised
her
resisting
a
wild
desire
to
laugh
that
a
dear
said
the
disregarding
the
relations
of
employer
and
employed
in
the
heat
of
professional
enthusiasm
and
you
help
it
as
quickly
as
possible
wo
you
it
will
be
put
on
the
table
after
all
the
other
sweets
every
second
will
be
of
importance
she
sighed
a
never
gets
a
fair
chance
it
ought
of
course
to
be
put
on
a
table
beside
the
and
cut
within
two
seconds
of
leaving
the
oven
with
a
spoon
she
sighed
tragically
we
do
our
best
for
it
norah
promised
her
i
sure
it
will
be
lovely
shall
i
come
and
tell
you
how
it
looked
afterwards
miss
de
lisle
beamed
now
that
would
be
very
kind
of
you
she
said
it
so
seldom
that
any
one
realizes
what
these
things
mean
to
the
cook
a
like
this
is
an
inspiration
like
a
sonata
to
a
musician
but
no
one
ever
dreams
of
the
cook
and
the
most
you
can
expect
from
a
butler
is
it
cut
very
nice
i
sure
very
nice
she
made
a
despairing
gesture
but
some
people
would
call
chopin
nice
miss
de
lisle
said
norah
earnestly
some
day
when
we
have
any
guests
and
dad
goes
to
london
we
give
every
one
else
a
holiday
and
you
and
i
will
have
lunch
here
together
and
we
have
that
and
eat
it
beside
the
range
for
a
moment
miss
de
lisle
had
no
words
well
she
said
at
length
explosively
and
i
was
so
horrible
to
you
at
first
to
norah
amazement
and
dismay
a
large
tear
trickled
down
one
cheek
and
her
mouth
quivered
like
a
child
dear
me
how
foolish
i
am
said
the
poor
rubbing
her
face
with
her
overall
and
thereby
streaking
it
most
curiously
with
flour
thank
you
very
much
my
dear
even
if
we
never
manage
it
i
wo
forget
that
you
said
it
norah
found
herself
patting
the
stalwart
shoulder
indeed
we
manage
it
she
said
now
do
you
worry
about
anything
but
that
lovely
oh
the
is
assured
now
said
miss
de
lisle
beating
her
mixture
scientifically
now
i
shall
have
beautiful
thoughts
to
put
into
it
you
have
no
idea
what
that
means
now
if
i
sat
here
mixing
and
thought
of
say
atkins
it
would
probably
be
as
heavy
as
lead
she
sighed
i
believe
miss
linton
i
could
teach
you
something
of
the
real
poetry
of
cooking
i
sure
you
have
the
right
sort
of
soul
norah
looked
embarrassed
jim
says
i
no
soul
beyond
mustering
cattle
she
said
laughing
we
prove
him
wrong
some
day
miss
de
lisle
shall
we
now
i
must
go
the
motor
will
be
back
presently
she
turned
suddenly
conscious
of
a
baleful
glance
oh
mrs
atkins
she
said
feebly
i
came
said
atkins
stonily
to
see
if
any
help
was
needed
in
the
kitchen
perhaps
as
you
are
here
miss
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
ask
the
cook
oh
nothing
thank
you
said
miss
de
lisle
airily
over
her
shoulder
atkins
sniffed
and
withdrew
that
done
it
has
it
said
the
well
do
worry
my
dear
i
see
you
through
anything
a
head
peeped
in
is
yersilf
has
all
the
luck
of
the
place
katty
said
bride
enviously
an
that
sarah
wo
give
me
so
much
as
a
above
if
it
was
to
turn
down
the
beds
itself
it
as
much
as
do
to
let
me
could
i
give
you
a
hand
here
at
all
miss
de
lisle
god
help
us
there
miss
norah
if
is
the
way
you
but
let
her
baste
the
turkey
for
a
minyit
she
go
upstairs
reshted
in
hersilf
said
katty
in
a
loud
whisper
the
creature
destroyed
with
bein
out
of
all
the
fun
oh
come
in
if
you
not
afraid
of
atkins
said
miss
de
lisle
norah
had
a
vision
of
bride
ecstatically
grasping
a
as
she
made
her
own
escape
allenby
was
just
shutting
the
as
she
turned
the
corner
a
tall
man
in
a
big
military
greatcoat
was
shaking
hands
with
her
father
here
captain
hardress
norah
norah
found
herself
looking
up
into
a
face
that
at
the
first
glance
she
thought
one
of
the
ugliest
she
had
ever
seen
then
the
newcomer
smiled
and
suddenly
the
ugliness
seemed
to
vanish
it
too
bad
to
take
you
by
storm
this
way
but
your
brother
would
hear
of
anything
else
of
course
not
said
linton
my
daughter
was
rather
afraid
you
might
be
a
brigadier
she
loses
her
nerve
at
the
idea
of
pouring
tea
for
anything
above
a
colonel
indeed
a
colonel
bad
enough
said
norah
ruefully
accustomed
to
people
with
one
or
two
stars
even
three
are
rather
alarming
she
shot
a
glance
at
his
shoulder
laughing
i
sure
you
not
half
as
alarmed
as
i
was
at
coming
said
captain
hardress
i
been
so
long
in
hospital
that
i
almost
forgotten
how
to
speak
to
any
one
except
doctors
and
nurses
his
face
that
lit
up
so
completely
when
he
smiled
relapsed
into
gloom
well
you
must
stand
here
norah
said
please
tell
me
if
like
dinner
in
your
room
or
if
you
rather
come
down
she
had
a
sudden
vision
of
west
shrill
voice
and
decided
that
she
might
be
tiring
to
this
man
with
the
gaunt
sad
face
hardress
hesitated
i
think
you
better
stay
upstairs
said
david
linton
just
for
till
you
feel
rested
i
come
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
you
after
dinner
if
i
may
i
should
like
that
awfully
said
hardress
well
if
you
sure
it
would
not
be
too
much
trouble
miss
linton
it
not
a
scrap
of
trouble
she
said
allenby
will
show
you
the
way
see
that
captain
hardress
has
a
good
fire
allenby
and
take
some
papers
and
magazines
up
she
looked
sadly
after
the
tall
figure
as
it
limped
away
he
was
not
much
older
than
jim
but
his
face
held
a
world
of
bitter
experience
you
must
let
the
tired
people
make
you
unhappy
mate
said
her
father
he
put
his
arm
round
her
as
they
went
into
the
to
await
their
guests
remember
they
would
be
here
if
they
did
need
help
of
some
sort
i
wo
be
stupid
said
norah
but
he
has
such
a
sorry
face
dad
when
he
does
smile
then
our
job
is
to
keep
him
smiling
said
david
linton
practically
there
came
a
voice
in
the
hall
and
west
swept
in
her
husband
following
at
her
heels
to
norah
inexperienced
eyes
she
was
more
gorgeous
than
the
queen
of
sheba
in
a
dress
of
sequins
that
glittered
and
flashed
with
every
movement
sarah
who
had
assisted
in
her
toilette
reported
to
the
kitchen
that
she
did
take
much
stock
in
a
dress
that
was
moulting
its
sequins
for
all
the
world
like
an
old
hen
but
norah
saw
no
deficiencies
and
was
greatly
impressed
by
her
guest
magnificence
she
was
also
rather
overcome
by
her
eloquence
which
had
the
effect
of
making
her
feel
speechless
not
that
that
greatly
mattered
as
west
never
noticed
whether
any
one
else
happened
to
speak
or
remain
silent
so
long
as
they
did
not
happen
to
drown
her
own
voice
such
a
lovely
room
she
twittered
comfortable
and
i
feel
sure
there
is
an
exquisite
view
and
a
fire
in
one
bedroom
in
dear
me
i
feel
i
ought
to
protest
only
i
sufficient
moral
courage
and
those
pine
logs
are
delicious
perhaps
you
are
burning
your
own
timber
ah
i
thought
so
that
makes
it
easier
for
me
to
refrain
from
prodding
up
my
moral
courage
ha
ha
norah
hunted
for
a
reply
and
failed
to
find
one
and
you
are
actually
australians
west
ran
on
interesting
i
always
do
think
that
australians
are
so
original
so
quaintly
original
it
must
be
the
wild
life
you
lead
so
unlike
dear
quiet
little
england
bushrangers
and
savage
natives
and
how
i
should
like
to
see
it
all
oh
you
would
find
other
attractions
as
well
west
linton
told
her
the
life
in
savage
places
phase
of
australian
history
is
rather
a
back
number
oh
quite
quite
agreed
his
guest
we
know
so
little
of
the
other
side
of
the
world
but
we
are
not
aloof
not
uninterested
we
recognize
the
fascination
of
it
all
the
glamour
yes
the
glamour
gordon
poems
bring
it
all
before
one
do
they
not
such
a
true
australian
you
must
be
very
proud
of
him
we
are
but
he
was
an
australian
said
linton
the
lady
sailed
on
unheeding
yes
the
voice
of
the
and
your
splendid
soldiers
too
i
assure
you
i
thrill
whenever
i
meet
one
of
the
dear
fellows
in
the
street
in
london
so
tall
and
stern
under
their
great
outposts
of
empire
that
is
what
i
say
to
myself
outposts
here
in
the
heart
of
our
dear
little
surrey
linking
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
it
were
the
strangeness
of
it
all
garrett
who
had
made
an
unobtrusive
entrance
some
little
time
before
and
had
been
enjoying
himself
hugely
in
the
background
now
came
up
to
the
group
on
the
hearthrug
and
was
duly
introduced
lately
from
france
did
you
say
asked
west
yesterday
fancy
like
coming
from
one
world
into
another
is
it
not
captain
garrett
to
be
only
yesterday
the
thunder
of
shot
and
shell
out
yonder
and
in
in
dear
little
surrey
said
garrett
innocently
quite
such
a
peaceful
county
war
seems
so
remote
you
must
tell
me
some
of
your
experiences
oh
i
never
have
any
said
garrett
hastily
now
now
she
shook
a
playful
forefinger
at
him
i
was
a
mother
to
my
husband
regiment
captain
garrett
i
assure
you
quite
i
used
to
say
to
all
our
subalterns
remember
that
this
house
is
open
to
you
at
any
time
i
felt
that
they
were
so
far
from
their
own
homes
your
troubles
to
me
i
would
say
let
us
straighten
them
out
together
and
did
they
garrett
asked
they
understood
me
they
knew
i
wanted
to
help
them
and
my
husband
encouraged
them
to
come
takes
some
encouragin
the
subaltern
of
the
present
day
unless
to
tennis
and
said
colonel
west
but
such
dear
boys
i
felt
their
mothers
would
have
been
so
glad
and
our
regiment
had
quite
a
name
for
nice
subalterns
there
is
something
so
delightful
about
a
subaltern
so
by
jove
yes
said
colonel
west
does
care
for
anything
on
earth
not
even
the
adjutant
now
algernon
but
at
that
moment
dinner
was
announced
and
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
which
was
an
unusual
fate
for
any
remark
of
west
it
was
norah
first
experience
as
hostess
at
her
since
in
this
connexion
billabong
did
not
seem
to
count
no
one
could
ever
have
been
nervous
at
billabong
besides
there
was
no
butler
there
here
allenby
gravely
irreproachable
with
sarah
and
bride
as
attendant
sprites
seemed
to
intensify
the
solemnity
of
everything
however
no
one
seemed
to
notice
anything
unusual
and
conversation
flowed
apace
colonel
west
did
not
want
to
talk
such
cooking
as
miss
de
lisle
appeared
to
him
to
deserve
the
compliment
of
silence
and
he
ate
in
an
abstraction
that
left
garrett
free
to
talk
to
norah
while
west
overwhelmed
linton
with
a
steady
flow
of
eloquence
that
began
with
the
soup
and
lasted
until
dessert
then
norah
and
west
withdrew
leaving
the
men
to
smoke
my
dear
your
cook
a
poem
said
west
as
they
returned
to
the
a
dinner
that
well
words
fail
me
i
so
glad
you
liked
it
norah
said
it
melted
in
the
mouth
and
i
watched
you
help
it
your
face
was
so
anxious
you
insinuated
the
spoon
with
such
an
expression
i
describe
it
norah
burst
out
laughing
i
could
she
said
the
cook
was
so
anxious
about
that
and
she
said
to
do
it
justice
it
should
be
helped
with
a
hot
spoon
so
i
told
allenby
to
stand
the
spoon
in
a
jug
of
boiling
water
and
give
it
to
me
at
the
very
last
moment
he
was
holding
it
in
the
napkin
he
had
for
drying
it
i
suppose
and
he
did
know
that
the
handle
was
nearly
but
i
did
when
i
took
it
up
my
dear
child
exclaimed
west
so
your
expression
was
due
to
agony
something
like
it
norah
laughed
it
was
just
all
i
could
do
to
hold
it
but
the
worth
it
was
it
i
must
tell
miss
de
lisle
miss
de
lisle
your
cook
yes
it
sounds
well
does
it
said
norah
she
a
dear
too
she
is
certainly
a
treasure
said
west
since
the
regiment
went
out
i
have
been
living
in
horrible
where
they
you
and
what
they
do
give
you
to
eat
is
so
murdered
in
the
cooking
that
you
can
hardly
swallow
it
economical
for
the
management
but
not
very
good
for
the
guests
but
one
must
take
things
as
they
come
in
this
horrible
war
she
paused
the
forced
smile
fading
from
her
lips
somehow
norah
felt
that
she
was
sorry
for
her
she
looked
suddenly
old
and
worn
and
tired
come
and
sit
in
this
big
chair
west
she
said
you
must
have
had
a
long
day
well
quite
said
west
you
see
i
went
to
take
my
husband
from
the
hospital
at
twelve
and
then
i
found
that
your
father
had
made
this
delightful
arrangement
for
us
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
so
i
had
to
send
algernon
to
his
club
and
i
rushed
back
to
my
and
packed
my
things
and
then
i
had
to
do
some
shopping
and
meet
them
at
the
station
and
of
course
i
never
could
get
a
taxi
when
i
wanted
one
i
really
think
i
am
a
little
tired
this
seems
the
kind
of
house
where
it
does
matter
to
admit
it
of
course
not
is
it
a
home
for
tired
people
norah
laughed
sarah
entered
with
coffee
and
she
fussed
gently
about
her
guest
settling
her
cushions
and
bringing
her
cup
to
her
side
with
cream
and
sugar
it
very
delightful
to
be
taken
care
of
said
west
with
a
sigh
the
affected
jerky
manner
dropped
from
her
and
she
became
more
natural
my
children
are
all
boys
i
often
have
been
sorry
that
one
was
not
a
girl
a
daughter
must
be
a
great
comfort
have
you
any
sisters
my
dear
no
just
one
brother
he
in
captain
garrett
regiment
and
you
will
go
back
to
australia
after
the
war
oh
yes
we
could
possibly
stay
away
from
australia
norah
said
you
see
it
home
and
england
has
not
made
you
care
any
less
for
it
goodness
no
norah
said
warmly
it
all
very
well
in
its
way
but
it
simply
ca
hold
a
candle
to
australia
but
why
norah
hesitated
it
a
bit
hard
to
say
she
answered
at
length
life
is
more
comfortable
here
in
some
ways
more
luxuries
and
conveniences
of
living
i
mean
and
england
is
beautiful
and
it
full
of
history
and
we
all
love
it
for
that
but
it
is
our
own
country
the
people
are
different
more
reserved
and
stiffer
but
it
is
even
that
i
do
know
said
norah
getting
tangled
i
think
it
the
air
and
the
space
and
the
freedom
that
we
used
to
and
we
miss
them
all
the
time
and
the
jolly
country
life
but
english
country
life
is
jolly
i
think
we
get
tired
of
it
said
norah
it
seems
to
us
all
play
and
in
australia
we
work
even
if
you
go
out
for
a
ride
there
most
likely
there
is
a
job
hanging
to
it
to
bring
in
cattle
or
count
them
or
see
that
a
fence
is
all
right
or
to
bring
home
the
mail
every
one
is
busy
and
the
life
all
round
is
interesting
i
think
i
explain
at
all
well
i
expect
the
real
explanation
is
just
that
the
love
for
one
own
country
is
in
one
bones
quite
said
west
quite
but
she
said
the
ridiculous
word
as
though
for
once
she
understood
and
there
was
a
comfortable
little
silence
between
them
for
a
few
minutes
then
the
men
came
in
and
the
evening
went
by
quickly
enough
with
games
and
music
captain
garrett
proved
to
be
the
possessor
of
a
very
fair
tenor
together
with
a
knack
of
vamping
not
unmelodious
accompaniments
the
cheery
songs
floated
out
into
the
hall
where
bride
and
katty
crouched
behind
a
screen
torn
between
delight
and
nervousness
if
the
ould
thing
was
to
come
she
have
the
hair
torn
off
of
us
breathed
katty
but
is
worth
the
rishk
blessed
hour
have
he
the
lovely
voice
he
have
but
i
rather
listen
to
miss
norah
said
bride
loyally
is
the
big
voice
she
do
be
having
but
it
that
it
was
after
ten
when
norah
having
said
to
her
guests
and
shown
west
to
her
room
went
softly
along
the
corridor
a
light
showed
under
miss
de
lisle
doorway
and
she
tapped
gently
the
door
opened
revealing
the
comfortable
little
with
a
fire
burning
merrily
in
the
grate
the
herself
was
an
extraordinarily
altered
being
in
a
kimono
with
heavy
white
embroidery
i
hoped
you
would
come
she
said
are
you
tired
poor
child
what
an
evening
i
wonder
would
you
have
a
cup
of
cocoa
with
me
here
i
have
it
ready
she
waved
a
large
hand
towards
a
fat
brown
jug
standing
on
a
trivet
by
the
grate
there
was
a
tray
on
a
little
table
bearing
cups
and
saucers
and
a
spongecake
norah
gave
way
promptly
i
love
it
she
said
how
good
of
you
i
was
much
too
excited
to
eat
dinner
but
the
was
just
perfect
miss
de
lisle
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
west
raved
about
it
after
dinner
i
am
glad
said
the
with
the
rapt
expression
of
a
allenby
told
me
how
you
arranged
for
a
hot
spoon
it
was
beautiful
of
you
beautiful
did
he
tell
you
how
hot
it
was
norah
inquired
they
grew
merry
over
the
story
and
the
spongecake
dwindled
simultaneously
with
the
cocoa
in
the
jug
i
must
go
norah
said
at
last
it
been
so
nice
thank
you
ever
so
miss
de
lisle
it
i
who
should
thank
you
for
staying
said
the
big
woman
rising
will
you
come
again
some
time
rather
if
i
may
she
shut
the
door
softly
and
scurried
along
to
her
room
unconscious
that
another
doorway
was
a
couple
of
inches
ajar
and
that
through
the
space
atkins
regarded
her
balefully
her
father
door
was
and
the
room
was
lit
norah
knocked
come
in
said
linton
you
you
bad
child
i
thought
you
were
in
bed
long
ago
i
going
now
norah
said
how
did
things
go
off
daddy
quite
well
he
said
and
my
daughter
made
a
good
hostess
i
think
they
all
enjoyed
themselves
norah
i
think
so
said
she
they
seemed
happy
enough
what
about
captain
hardress
dad
he
seemed
comfortable
linton
answered
i
found
him
on
a
couch
with
a
rug
over
him
reading
allenby
said
he
ate
a
fair
dinner
he
a
nice
fellow
norah
i
like
him
was
he
badly
wounded
dad
he
did
say
much
about
himself
i
gathered
that
he
had
been
a
long
while
in
hospital
but
i
sorry
for
him
norah
he
seems
very
down
on
his
luck
jim
said
so
remarked
norah
well
we
must
try
to
buck
him
up
i
suppose
allenby
will
look
after
him
dad
if
he
needs
anything
i
told
him
to
said
linton
with
a
grin
he
looked
at
me
coldly
and
said
sir
i
know
my
duty
to
a
wounded
officer
i
believe
i
found
myself
apologizing
there
are
times
when
allenby
quite
fails
to
hide
his
opinion
of
a
mere
civilian
i
see
myself
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
his
eyes
as
we
fill
this
place
up
with
khaki
norah
chapter
ix
homewood
gets
busy
good
morning
captain
hardress
hardress
turned
he
was
standing
in
the
porch
looking
out
over
the
park
towards
the
yellowing
woods
good
morning
miss
linton
i
hope
you
forgive
me
for
being
so
lazy
as
to
stay
in
bed
for
breakfast
you
have
to
blame
your
butler
he
simply
did
call
me
the
first
thing
i
knew
was
an
enormous
tray
with
enough
breakfast
for
six
men
and
allenby
grinning
behind
it
you
stay
in
bed
to
breakfast
here
or
get
up
just
as
you
feel
inclined
norah
said
there
are
any
rules
except
two
is
that
a
bit
irish
not
exactly
because
jim
says
even
those
two
may
be
broken
but
i
do
agree
to
that
at
least
not
for
rule
do
tell
me
them
he
begged
rule
is
at
ten
that
the
one
that
may
be
broken
when
necessary
rule
is
do
just
what
you
feel
like
doing
that
the
one
i
wo
have
broken
unless
any
one
wants
to
do
things
that
are
good
for
them
then
i
shall
remember
that
they
are
patients
and
become
severe
but
i
not
a
patient
no
but
you
tired
you
got
to
get
quite
fit
what
would
you
like
to
do
would
you
care
to
come
for
a
ride
hardress
flushed
darkly
afraid
i
ca
ride
oh
i
sorry
said
norah
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
this
lean
fellow
with
the
nervous
hands
certainly
looked
as
though
he
should
be
able
to
ride
indeed
there
were
no
men
in
norah
world
who
could
not
but
perhaps
what
about
a
walk
then
she
inquired
do
you
feel
up
to
it
again
hardress
flushed
i
thought
your
brother
would
have
explained
he
said
heavily
i
ca
do
anything
much
miss
linton
you
see
i
only
one
leg
norah
grey
eyes
were
wide
with
distress
i
did
know
she
faltered
the
telephone
was
out
of
order
jim
could
explain
i
so
terribly
sorry
you
must
have
thought
me
stupid
not
a
bit
after
all
it
rather
a
compliment
to
the
article
i
was
afraid
it
was
evident
enough
indeed
it
is
norah
assured
him
i
knew
you
limped
a
little
but
it
was
very
noticeable
it
supposed
to
be
a
special
one
hardress
said
i
hardly
used
to
it
yet
though
and
it
feels
awkward
enough
they
been
experimenting
with
it
for
some
time
and
now
i
a
sort
of
trial
case
for
that
brand
of
leg
the
maker
swears
i
be
able
to
dance
with
it
he
a
hopeful
soul
i
not
you
ought
to
try
to
be
norah
said
and
it
really
must
be
a
very
good
one
she
felt
a
kind
of
horror
at
talking
of
it
in
this
fashion
i
think
most
of
the
hopefulness
was
knocked
out
of
me
hardress
answered
you
see
i
wanted
to
save
the
old
leg
and
they
tried
to
and
then
it
was
a
case
of
one
operation
after
another
until
at
last
they
took
it
off
near
the
hip
norah
went
white
near
the
hip
her
voice
shook
oh
it
could
be
you
so
big
and
strong
hardress
laughed
grimly
i
used
to
think
it
could
be
myself
he
said
well
i
suppose
one
will
get
accustomed
to
it
in
time
i
sorry
i
distressed
you
miss
linton
only
i
thought
i
had
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
glad
you
did
norah
had
found
control
of
her
voice
and
her
wits
she
remembered
that
this
maimed
lad
with
the
set
face
was
there
to
be
helped
and
that
it
was
part
of
her
job
to
do
it
her
very
soul
was
wrung
with
pity
but
she
forced
a
smile
now
you
have
just
got
to
let
us
help
she
said
we
ca
try
to
make
forget
it
i
know
but
we
can
help
to
make
the
best
of
it
you
can
practise
using
it
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
seeing
just
what
you
can
do
with
it
and
captain
hardress
i
know
they
do
wonders
now
with
artificial
legs
dad
knew
of
a
man
who
played
tennis
with
his
as
bad
a
case
as
yours
that
certainly
seems
too
good
to
be
true
said
hardress
i
do
know
about
that
said
norah
eagerly
your
leg
must
be
very
good
none
of
us
guessed
the
truth
about
it
when
you
get
used
to
it
you
be
able
to
manage
all
sorts
of
things
golf
for
instance
there
a
jolly
little
course
in
the
park
and
i
know
you
could
play
i
had
thought
golf
might
be
a
possibility
he
said
not
that
i
ever
cared
much
for
it
my
two
games
were
polo
and
rugby
football
i
do
know
about
rugby
said
norah
thoughtfully
but
of
course
you
play
polo
again
some
one
was
writing
in
one
of
the
papers
lately
saying
that
so
many
men
had
lost
a
leg
in
the
war
that
the
makers
would
have
to
invent
special
for
hunting
and
polo
i
know
very
well
that
if
jim
came
home
without
a
leg
he
still
go
mustering
cattle
or
know
the
reason
why
and
there
was
the
case
of
an
irishman
a
while
ago
who
had
no
legs
at
all
and
he
used
to
hunt
by
jove
said
hardress
well
you
cheer
a
fellow
up
miss
linton
you
see
i
have
jim
and
wally
said
norah
do
you
know
wally
by
the
way
is
that
meadows
oh
yes
i
met
him
with
your
brother
well
he
just
like
my
brother
he
nearly
lives
with
us
and
from
the
time
that
they
joined
up
we
had
to
think
of
the
chance
of
their
losing
a
limb
jim
never
says
anything
about
it
but
i
know
wally
dreads
it
dad
and
i
found
out
all
we
could
about
artificial
limbs
and
what
can
be
done
with
them
so
that
we
could
help
the
boys
if
they
had
bad
luck
they
are
all
right
so
far
but
of
course
there
is
always
the
chance
hardress
nodded
we
planned
that
if
bad
luck
came
we
would
try
to
get
them
to
do
as
much
as
possible
of
course
an
arm
is
worse
to
lose
a
leg
is
bad
enough
goodness
knows
but
it
better
than
an
arm
that
one
of
the
problems
i
been
studying
hardress
said
grimly
oh
but
it
is
and
with
you
why
in
a
few
years
no
one
will
ever
guess
that
you
have
anything
wrong
it
luck
in
one
way
because
a
leg
does
make
you
conspicuous
and
an
arm
does
that
true
he
said
energetically
i
have
hoped
desperately
that
i
be
able
to
hide
it
i
just
could
stick
the
idea
of
people
looking
at
me
well
they
wo
said
norah
and
the
more
you
can
carry
on
as
usual
the
less
bad
it
will
seem
now
let
plan
what
you
can
tackle
first
can
you
walk
much
not
much
i
get
tired
after
about
fifty
yards
well
we
do
fifty
yards
whenever
you
feel
like
it
and
then
sit
down
and
talk
until
you
can
go
on
again
she
hesitated
you
it
does
trouble
you
to
sit
down
oh
no
said
hardress
laughing
for
the
first
time
it
an
awfully
docile
leg
then
can
you
drive
there
the
motor
and
a
roomy
and
the
carriage
yes
i
can
drive
oh
i
say
cried
norah
inelegantly
struck
by
a
brilliant
idea
can
you
drive
a
motor
no
i
ca
i
sorry
i
not
con
will
teach
you
it
will
give
you
quite
a
new
interest
would
you
like
to
learn
by
jove
i
would
he
said
eagerly
you
sure
your
father
mind
my
risking
his
car
dad
would
laugh
at
such
a
foolish
question
said
norah
we
go
and
see
con
now
shall
we
it
not
far
to
the
stables
you
might
have
a
lesson
at
once
rather
he
said
boyishly
i
say
miss
linton
you
are
a
brick
now
about
golf
norah
said
as
they
moved
slowly
away
hardress
leaning
heavily
on
his
stick
will
you
try
to
play
a
little
with
me
we
could
begin
at
the
beyond
the
terrace
yes
i
like
to
he
said
and
billiards
we
wait
for
a
wet
day
because
i
want
you
to
live
in
the
open
air
as
much
as
possible
i
ca
play
decently
but
captain
garrett
is
staying
here
and
jim
and
wally
come
over
pretty
often
you
might
let
me
teach
to
play
he
suggested
would
you
care
to
oh
i
love
it
said
norah
beaming
the
beam
had
he
known
it
was
one
of
delight
at
the
new
ring
in
her
patient
voice
life
had
come
back
to
it
he
held
his
head
erect
and
his
eyes
were
no
longer
hopeless
and
riding
she
hesitated
i
do
know
he
said
i
do
believe
i
could
even
get
on
there
a
steady
old
pony
norah
said
why
not
practise
on
him
he
stands
like
a
rock
i
wo
stay
and
look
at
you
but
con
could
you
see
he
lost
a
leg
himself
so
you
would
mind
him
sure
you
find
you
can
manage
and
when
you
get
confidence
we
go
out
together
well
you
would
put
hope
into
into
a
dead
codfish
he
said
great
scott
if
i
thought
i
could
get
on
a
horse
again
norah
laughed
we
all
she
said
if
i
were
like
you
i
know
that
to
ride
would
be
the
thing
that
would
help
me
most
so
you
have
just
got
to
they
had
arrived
at
the
stables
where
con
had
the
car
out
and
was
lovingly
polishing
its
bonnet

captain
hardress

i
want

to
begin
riding
brecon
she
smiled
at
hardress
and
ran
off
looking
back
just
before
the
shrubberies
hid
the
hardress
was
peering
into
the
bonnet
of
the
car
with
con
evidently
explaining
its
inner
mysteries
just
as
she
looked
he
straightened
up
and
threw
off
his
coat
with
a
quick
gesture
all
right
said
norah
happily
she
hurried
on
the
tired
people
were
off
her
hands
for
the
morning
colonel
and
west
had
gone
for
a
drive
captain
garrett
was
playing
golf
with
major
hunt
who
was
developing
rapidly
in
playing
a
game
and
was
extremely
interested
in
his
own
progress
it
was
the
day
for
posting
to
australia
and
there
was
a
long
letter
to
brownie
to
be
finished
and
one
to
jean
yorke
her
chum
in
melbourne
already
it
was
late
in
the
study
her
father
had
been
deep
in
his
letters
for
over
an
hour
but
as
she
came
up
to
the
porch
she
saw
him
in
the
hall
oh
norah
he
said
with
relief
i
been
looking
for
you
a
letter
from
harry
trevor
of
all
people
harry
said
norah
delightedly
oh
i
so
glad
where

he
dad
he
in
london
this
letter
has
been
wandering
round
after
us

it
days
ago

a
commission
now
got
it
on
the
field

two
other
fellows
with
him
he
says
and
he
does
know
any
one

be
to
see
us
what
are
we
to
do
norah
can
we
have
them
here
why
we
have
them
norah
said
she
made
a
swift
mental
calculation
yes

can
manage
it
you
sure
asked
her
father
evidently
relieved
i
was
afraid
it

be
too
much
for
the
house
and
i
would
be
very
sorry
to
put
them
off
put
off

said
her
father
looking
at
her
respectfully
i

wild
buffalo
i
not

would
returned
norah
however
she
all
the
buffalo

over
she
turned
as
she
reached

how
glad
we
are
dad
and
do
you
think
you
ought
to
let
jim
know
yes
i
ring
him
up
too
and
off
went
norah
singing
three
australians
in
dear
little
surrey
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
but
atkins
did
not
think
so
she
was
sorting
linen
with
a
sour
face
when
norah
entered
her
sanctum
and
made
known
her
news
the
housekeeper
remained
silent
for
a
moment
well
i
do
see
how
we
to
manage
miss
she
said
at
length
the
house
is
pretty
full
as
it
is
there
is
the
big
room
with
two
single
beds
norah
said
we
can
put
a
third
bed
in
they
wo
mind
being
together
atkins
sniffed
it
is
usual
to
crowd
people
like
that
miss
it
wo
matter
in
this
case
said
norah
did
you
say
australians
miss
asked
the
housekeeper
officers
one
is
an
officer
and
the
others
miss
i
do
know
privates
very
possibly
said
norah
it
matter
not
matter
well
upon
my
word
ejaculated
atkins
well
all
i
can
say
miss
is
that
it
very
funny
and
how
do
you
think
the
maids
are
going
to
do
all
that
extra
work
norah
began
to
experience
a
curious
feeling
of
tingling
i
am
quite
sure
the
maids
can
manage
it
she
said
commanding
her
voice
with
an
effort
for
one
thing
i
can
easily
help
more
than
i
do
now
we
not
accustomed
in
this
country
to
young
ladies
doing
that
sort
of
thing
said
atkins
her
evil
temper
mastered
her
and
your
pet
cook
the
fine
lady
who
too
grand
to
sit
with
me
norah
found
her
voice
suddenly
calm
you
must
speak
to
me
like
that
atkins
she
said
marvelling
at
her
own
courage
you
will
have
to
go
away
if
you
ca
behave
properly
atkins
choked
go
away
she
said
thickly
yes
i
go
away
i
not
going
to
stay
in
a
house
like
this
that
no
more
and
no
less
than
a
you
and
your
friend
the
cook
can
be
quiet
woman
said
a
voice
of
thunder
norah
who
had
shrunk
back
before
the
angry
housekeeper
felt
a
throb
of
relief
as
allenby
strode
into
the
room
at
the
moment
there
was
nothing
of
the
butler
about
him
he
was
sergeant
allenby
and
atkins
was
simply
a
refractory
private
i
wo
be
quiet
screamed
the
housekeeper
i
you
will
do
as
you
told
said
allenby
dropping
a
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder
that
enough
now
not
another
word
now
go
to
your
room
out
of
or
i
send
for
the
police
something
in
the
hard
quiet
voice
filled
atkins
with
terror
she
cast
a
bitter
look
at
norah
and
then
slunk
out
of
the
room
allenby
closed
the
door
behind
her
i
very
sorry
miss
he
said
butler
once
more
i
hope
she
frighten
you
oh
no
only
she
was
rather
horrible
said
norah
whatever
is
the
matter
with
her
allenby
i
had
said
anything
to
make
her
so
idiotic
i
been
suspecting
what
was
the
matter
these
last
three
days
said
allenby
darkly
look
miss
he
opened
a
cupboard
disclosing
rows
of
empty
bottles
i
found
these
this
morning
when
she
was
in
the
kitchen
i
been
missing
bottles
from
the
cellar
she
must
have
another
key
to
the
she
managed
it
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
linton
came
in
to
have
the
situation
briefly
explained
to
him
i
would
have
had
it
happen
for
something
he
said
angrily
my
poor
little
girl
i
did
think
we
were
letting
you
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
why
you
could
help
it
norah
said
and
she
did
hurt
me
she
was
only
unpleasant
but
i
think
we
had
better
keep
her
out
of
miss
de
lisle
way
or
she
might
be
hard
to
handle
that
so
miss
said
allenby
i
go
and
see
to
i
should
think
so
see
that
she
packs
her
box
allenby
said
linton
i
write
her
cheque
at
once
and
con
can
take
her
to
the
station
as
soon
as
she
is
ready
she
not
too
bad
to
travel
i
suppose
she
not
bad
at
all
sir
only
enough
to
make
her
nasty
well
she
can
go
and
be
nasty
somewhere
else
said
linton
very
well
allenby
he
turned
to
norah
looking
unhappy
whatever
will
you
do
my
girl
and
this
houseful
of
people
i
better
telephone
harry
and
put
his
party
off
indeed
you
wo
said
norah
very
cheerfully
i
manage
dad
do
you
worry
i
going
to
talk
to
miss
de
lisle
the
was
not
in
the
kitchen
katty
washing
vegetables
diligently
referred
norah
to
her
and
there
she
was
found
knitting
a
long
khaki
muffler
she
heard
the
story
in
silence
so
i
must
do
just
the
best
i
can
miss
de
lisle
norah
ended
and
i
wondering
if
you
think
i
must
really
advertise
for
another
housekeeper
it
did
seem
to
me
that
atkins
did
much
except
give
orders
and
surely
i
can
do
that
after
a
little
practice
norah
flushed
and
looked
anxious
of
course
i
do
want
to
make
a
mess
of
the
whole
thing
i
know
the
house
must
be
well
run
well
said
miss
de
lisle
knitting
with
feverish
energy
i
have
said
it
if
you
had
asked
me
but
as
you
have
i
would
like
to
propose
something
perhaps
it
may
sound
as
if
i
thought
too
much
of
myself
but
with
a
cook
like
me
you
do
need
a
housekeeper
i
have
a
conscience
and
i
know
how
things
ought
to
be
run
so
my
proposal
is
this
and
you
and
your
father
must
just
do
as
you
like
about
it
why
not
make
me
oh
but
could
you
norah
cried
delightedly
would
it
be
too
much
work
i
do
think
so
of
course
i
expecting
that
you
going
to
help
in
supervising
things
i
can
teach
you
anything
you
see
katty
is
a
treasure
i
back
down
in
all
i
ever
thought
about
irish
maids
said
the
parenthetically
and
she
makes
me
laugh
all
day
and
i
would
be
without
her
for
anything
give
me
a
smart
boy
in
the
kitchen
for
the
rough
work
then
katty
can
do
more
of
the
plain
cooking
which
she
love
and
i
shall
have
more
time
out
of
the
kitchen
now
what
do
you
say
me
said
norah
i
like
to
hug
you
i
wish
you
would
said
miss
de
lisle
knitting
more
frantically
than
ever
you
see
this
is
the
first
place
i
been
in
where
really
been
treated
like
a
human
being
you
did
patronize
me
and
you
did
snub
me
any
of
you
but
you
laughed
with
me
and
it
was
a
mighty
long
time
since
laughing
had
come
into
my
job
dear
me
finished
miss
de
lisle
you
no
idea
how
at
home
with
you
all
felt
since
allenby
fell
over
me
in
the
passage
we
loved
you
from
that
minute
said
norah
laughing
then
you
think
we
can
really
manage
you
have
to
let
me
consult
with
you
over
everything
ordering
and
all
that
because
i
do
want
to
learn
my
job
and
you
wo
mind
how
many
people
we
bring
in
fill
the
house
to
if
you
like
said
miss
de
lisle
if
you
do
have
a
housekeeper
you
have
two
extra
rooms
to
put
your
tired
people
in
what
the
good
of
a
scheme
like
this
if
you
do
run
it
thoroughly
she
found
herself
suddenly
hugged
to
the
no
small
disadvantage
of
the
knitting
oh
i
so
happy
norah
cried
now
i
going
to
enjoy
the
home
for
tired
people
and
up
till
now
atkins
has
lain
on
my
soul
like
a
ton
of
bricks
bless
you
miss
de
lisle
i
going
to
tell
dad
her
racing
footsteps
flew
down
the
corridor
but
miss
de
lisle
sat
still
with
a
half
smile
on
her
rugged
face
once
she
put
her
hand
up
to
the
place
where
norah
lips
had
brushed
her
cheek
dear
me
she
murmured
well
it
fifteen
years
since
any
one
did
still
smiling
she
picked
up
the
knitting
chapter
x
australia
in
surrey
the
three
australians
came
that
afternoon
and
like
many
australians
in
the
wilds
of
london
with
a
vague
idea
of
distances
having
given
themselves
good
time
to
catch
their
train
managed
to
catch
the
one
before
it
and
so
arrived
at
homewood
unheralded
and
unsung
norah
and
captain
hardress
who
had
been
knocking
about
were
crossing
the
terrace
on
their
way
to
tea
when
the
three
slouched
hats
caught
norah
eye
through
the
trees
of
the
avenue
she
gasped
dropped
her
clubs
and
fled
to
meet
them
hardress
stared
then
perceiving
the
newcomers
smiled
a
little
and
went
on
slowly
i
like
to
see
her
doing
a
hundred
yards
he
said
the
three
soldiers
jumped
as
the
flying
figure
came
upon
them
round
a
bend
in
the
drive
then
one
of
them
sprang
forward
harry
said
norah
my
word
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
harry
trevor
pumping
her
hand
i
say
norah
you
have
changed
a
bit
you
just
the
same
as
when
you
were
twelve
only
that
you
grown
several
feet
did
you
expect
to
find
me
bald
and
fat
norah
laughed
oh
harry
we
are
glad
to
see
you
well
you
might
have
aged
a
little
said
he
goodness
knows
have
norah
where
old
jim
he
at
aldershot
but
you
can
be
certain
that
he
be
here
as
soon
as
he
possibly
can
and
wally
too
that
good
business
he
suddenly
remembered
his
friends
who
were
affecting
great
interest
in
the
botanical
features
of
a
come
here
you
chaps
norah
this
is
jack
blake
and
dick
harrison
they
awfully
glad
to
see
you
too
well
you
might
have
let
us
say
it
for
ourselves
digger
said
the
two
shaking
hands
we
were
just
going
to
it
lovely
to
have
you
all
said
norah
she
looked
over
the
tree
all
tall
fellows
lean
and
bronzed
with
quiet
faces
and
eyes
blake
bore
a
sergeant
stripes
dick
harrison
sleeve
modestly
proclaimed
him
a
we
been
wandering
in
that
funny
old
london
like
lost
sheep
blake
said
my
word
that
a
lonesome
place
if
you
do
happen
to
know
any
one
in
it
and
people
look
at
you
as
if
you
were
something
out
of
a
zoo
they
not
used
to
you
yet
said
norah
it
the
hat
as
much
as
anything
i
do
know
about
that
harry
said
no
i
think
they
know
we
came
out
of
a
different
mob
even
if
we
were
branded
perhaps
they
would
and
you
certainly
do
norah
answered
but
come
on
to
the
house
dad
is
just
as
anxious
to
see
you
as
any
one
indeed
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
david
linton
was
seen
coming
with
long
strides
to
meet
them
hardress
told
me
you
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
marathon
runner
at
the
sight
of
three
big
hats
he
said
how
are
you
harry
it
an
age
since
we
saw
you
yes
is
it
harry
shook
hands
warmly
and
introduced
his
friends
you
have
changed
either
mr
linton
i
ought
to
be
aging
only
norah
wo
hear
of
it
said
linton
laughing
she
bullies
me
more
hopelessly
than
ever
harry
she
always
did
trevor
agreed
oh

want
to
talk
about
billabong
for
an
hour
how
brownie
nor
and
murty
and
black
billy
how
do
you

to
live
away
from
them
it
is
easy
norah
answered
they
all
very
fit
only
they
want
us
back
we
ca
allow
ourselves
to
think
of
the
day
that
get
home
or
we
all
grow
it
will
be
no
end
of
a
day
for
all
of
us
said
harrison
think
of
marching
down
collins
street
again
with
the
crowd
cheering
us
keeping
an
eye
out
for
the
people
one
knew
it
was
fairly
beastly
marching
up
it
for
the
last
time
it
not
collins
street
i
want
but
a
bit
of
the
gippsland
track
said
jack
blake
you
know
dick
we
took
cattle
there
last
year
over
the
haunted
hills
are
they
jolly
in
the
spring
and
down
through
the
scrub
to
morwell
and
traralgon
i
give
something
to
see
that
bit
of
country
again
ah
it
all
good
country
david
linton
said
then
they
were
at
the
house
and
a
buzz
of
conversation
floated
out
to
them
from
the
hall
where
tea
was
in
progress
your
father
simply
made
me
promise
to
go
on
without
you
said
west
as
norah
made
her
apologies
i
said
it
was
dreadful
but
he
would
listen
to
me
and
there
are
your
friends
dear
me
how
large
they
are
and
so
brown
do
introduce
them
to
me
i
planning
to
hear
all
about
australia
and
a
sergeant
and
is
it
romantic
to
see
them
among
us
and
quite
at
their
ease
tell
them
i
a
colonel
wife
my
dear
i
would
hate
them
to
feel
embarrassed
i
do
think
you
need
worry
said
norah
smiling
to
herself
she
brought
up
the
three
newcomers
and
introduced
them
they
subsided
upon
a
sofa
and
listened
solemnly
while
west
opened
all
her
conversational
batteries
upon
them
norah
heard
the
opening
read
such
a
about
your
charming
country
and
felt
a
throb
of
pity
for
the
three
wanderers
from
afar
hardress
came
towards
her
with
a
cup
of
tea
his
limb
a
little
more
evident
you
tired
she
said
taking
it
from
him
sure
you
have
done
too
much
not
a
bit
he
said
i
a
little
tired
but
it
the
best
day
i
have
had
for
many
a
month
i
do
know
when
i
enjoyed
anything
as
much
as
my
this
morning
con
says
you
be
able
to
drive
in
piccadilly
in
no
time
said
norah
he
hopeful
hardress
said
laughing
particularly
as
we
never
started
the
car
at
all
he
made
me
learn
everything
i
could
about
it
first
and
did
he
tell
you
i
rode
brecon
no
how
did
you
get
on
asked
norah
delightedly
well
i
literally
got
on
very
badly
at
first
the
shop
leg
seem
to
understand
what
was
wanted
of
it
at
all
and
any
steed
but
brecon
would
have
strongly
resented
me
but
he
stood
in
a
pensive
attitude
while
i
tried
all
sorts
of
experiments
in
fact
i
think
he
went
to
sleep
i
told
you
you
could
rely
on
brecon
norah
smiled
what
happened
then
oh
i
got
used
to
myself
and
found
out
the
knack
of
getting
on
it
not
hard
with
a
steady
horse
once
you
find
out
how
but
i
think
brecon
will
do
me
very
well
for
awhile
oh
we
soon
get
you
on
to
brunette
norah
said
you
enjoy
her
is
that
the
black
pony
yes
and
she
a
lovely
hack
i
going
to
hunt
her
in
the
winter
she
jumps
like
a
deer
she
looked
a
beauty
in
the
stable
hardress
said
she
ought
to
make
a
good
he
sighed
i
wonder
if
i
really
ever
play
polo
again
of
course
you
will
norah
told
him
this
morning
you
did
think
you
would
ever
get
on
a
horse
again
no
i
certainly
did
you
have
put
an
extraordinary
amount
of
hope
into
me
i
feel
a
different
being
he
stopped
and
a
smile
crept
into
his
eyes
listen
are
your
friends
having
a
time
life
must
be
so
exciting
on
your
great
cattle
ranches
west
was
saying
and
the
dear
little
woolly
lambs
on
the
farms
such
pets
we
understood
you
people
over
here
prefer
them
frozen
blake
said
gently
so
we
send
that
way
norah
choked
over
her
tea
she
became
aware
that
colonel
west
was
speaking
to
her
and
tried
to
command
her
wits
hearing
as
she
turned
west
shrill
pipe
and
what
a
is
it
something
you
wear
norah
would
have
given
much
to
hear
reply
delightful
place
you
have
here
barked
the
colonel
your
father
and
i
have
been
spending
an
agricultural
afternoon
planning
all
the
things
he
means
to
do
on
that
farm
hawkins
is
it
but
i
suppose
you
do
take
much
interest
in
that
sort
of
thing
dances
and
frocks
more
in
your
line
and
chocolates
eh
what
then
you
changed
her
in
england
said
harry
trevor
suddenly
is
it
dances
now
norah
no
more
quick
things
over
the
grass
after
a
bullock
do
say
you
forgotten
how
to
use
a
stockwhip
it
hung
up
at
billabong
norah
said
laughing
but
you
wait
until
i
get
back
to
it
that
all
dear
me
said
west
and
you
do
these
wonderful
things
too
i
always
longed
to
do
them
as
a
girl
to
ride
over
long
leagues
of
plain
on
a
fiery
mustang
among
your
lovely
eucalyptus
trees
and
do
you
really
go
out
with
the
cowboys
and
use
a
lasso
she
does
said
harry
happily
your
wild
animals
too
said
west
it
kangaroos
you
ride
down
with
spears
is
it
not
and
wallabies
we
live
in
dear
quiet
little
england
but
we
read
all
about
your
wonderful
life
and
are
oh
so
interested
what
a
life
said
dick
harrison
under
his
breath
quite
you
know
i
had
a
great
friend
who
went
out
as
to
one
of
your
governors
he
had
to
return
after
a
month
because
his
father
died
and
he
came
into
the
baronetcy
but
some
day
he
means
to
write
a
book
on
australia
that
is
why
i
have
always
as
it
were
kept
in
touch
with
your
great
country
i
seem
to
know
it
so
well
though
i
have
never
seen
it
you
do
indeed
said
blake
gravely
i
wish
we
knew
half
as
much
about
yours
ah
but
you
must
let
us
show
it
to
you
is
it
not
yours
too
outposts
of
empire
that
is
what
i
call
you
outposts
of
empire
is
it
not
that
that
brought
you
to
fight
under
our
flag
oh
rather
said
blake
vaguely
but
a
lot
of
us
just
wanted
a
look
in
at
the
fun
well
you
got
a
good
deal
for
a
start
said
garrett
yes
abdul
gave
us
all
we
wanted
on
his
little
peninsula
but
not
a
bad
old
abdul
we
do
mind
how
often
we
take
tea
with
him
he
a
better
man
to
fight
than
fritz
he
could
pretty
easily
be
that
garrett
said
it
one
of
the
worst
grudges
we
owe
fritz
that
he
taken
all
the
decency
out
of
war
it
used
to
be
a
man
game
but
the
boche
made
it
one
according
to
his
own
ideas
and
everybody
knows
what
they
are
yes
said
hardress
i
suppose
the
boche
will
do
a
good
deal
of
crawling
to
get
back
among
decent
people
after
the
war
but
never
live
down
his
and
and
would
it
have
been
a
gorgeous
old
war
if
he
only
fought
clean
said
garrett
longingly
they
drew
together
and
talked
as
fighting
men
will
veterans
in
the
ways
of
war
though
the
eldest
was
not
much
over
the
sudden
hoot
of
a
motor
came
from
the
drive
and
then
another
and
another
some
one
said
harry
trevor
the
hooting
increased
and
with
it
the
hum
of
a
racing
car
the
gravel
outside
the
porch
crunched
as
it
drew
up
and
then
came
cheery
voices
and
two
long
figures
in
great
coats
dashed
in
jim
and
wally
dad
norah
where
old
harry
but
harry
was
grasping
a
hand
of
each
and
submitting
to
mighty
pats
on
the
back
from
their
other
hands
by
jove
it
great
to
see
you
where
did
you
come
from
you
old
reprobate
finished
johnny
turk
gradually
the
boys
became
aware
that
there
were
other
people
in
the
hall
and
made
apologies
interrupted
by
another
burst
of
joy
at
discovering
garrett
you
must
think
us
bears
said
jim
with
his
disarming
smile
to
west
but
we
had
seen
trevor
for
years
and
he
a
very
old
chum
it
would
have
been
exciting
to
meet
him
in
australia
but
in
england
well
however
did
you
manage
to
come
norah
asked
beaming
oh
we
got
leave
we
been
good
boys
at
least
wally
was
until
we
got
your
message
this
morning
since
then
he
has
been
wandering
about
like
a
lost
fowl
murmuring
harry
is
it
me
returned
wally
do
believe
him
nor
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
him
from
slapping
the
on
the
back
and
borrowing
his
car
to
come
over
i
do
doubt
it
norah
laughed
whose
car
did
you
borrow
by
the
way
oh
we
hired
one
it
was
extravagant
but
we
agreed
that
it
every
day
we
kill
a
pig
thank
you
said
harry
years
have
altered
your
power
of
putting
a
thing
nicely
he
smote
wally
affectionately
i
say
you
were
a
kid
when
i
saw
you
last
a
kid
in
knickerbockers
and
look
at
you
now
well
you
were
much
the
same
wally
retorted
and
now
you
a
hardened
old
warrior
i
only
played
at
it
so
far
but
you
were
gassed
were
you
yes
but
we
had
had
much
war
before
they
gassed
us
that
was
the
annoying
part
well
did
you
have
a
little
private
war
in
ireland
what
about
that
german
submarine
oh
that
was
sheer
luck
said
wally
joyfully
a
lark
only
for
one
thing
but
we
do
consider
we
earned
our
keep
yet
oh
well
you
got
lots
of
time
harry
said
i
wonder
if
send
any
of
us
to
france
it
would
be
rather
fun
if
we
got
somewhere
in
your
part
of
the
line
yes
would
it
then
jack
blake
who
had
been
at
school
with
the
boys
came
up
with
dick
harrison
and
england
ceased
to
exist
for
the
five
australians
they
talked
of
their
own
country
old
days
at
school
battles
on
the
melbourne
cricket
ground
on
the
yarra
billabong
and
other
stations
and
long
days
on
the
road
with
cattle
and
nights
spent
watching
them
under
the
stars
all
the
grim
business
of
life
that
had
been
theirs
since
those
days
seemed
but
to
make
their
own
land
dearer
by
comparison
not
that
they
said
so
in
words
but
they
lingered
over
their
talk
with
an
unspoken
delight
in
being
at
home
again
even
in
memory
norah
slipped
away
regretfully
enough
after
a
time
her
responsibilities
as
housekeeper
weighed
upon
her
and
she
sought
miss
de
lisle
in
the
kitchen
what
your
brother
and
wally
how
delightful
ejaculated
the
that
what
i
call
really
jolly
their
rooms
are
always
ready
i
suppose
oh
yes
norah
said
i
told
bride
to
put
sheets
on
the
beds
then
that
all
right
dinner
my
dear
you
need
never
worry
about
a
couple
extra
for
dinner
in
a
household
of
this
size
just
tell
the
maids
to
lay
the
table
accordingly
and
let
me
know
that
is
all
you
need
do
atkins
had
destroyed
my
nerve
said
norah
laughing
i
came
down
to
tell
you
with
the
same
scared
feeling
that
i
had
when
i
used
to
go
to
her
room
my
very
knees
were
shaking
then
you
a
very
bad
child
if
you
my
employer
returned
miss
de
lisle
however
i
forgive
you
but
some
time
i
want
you
to
make
a
list
for
me
of
the
things
those
big
boys
of
yours
like
most
i
might
just
as
well
cook
them
as
not
when
they
come
and
of
course
when
they
go
out
to
france
we
shall
have
to
send
them
splendid
hampers
that
will
be
a
tremendous
comfort
norah
said
you
a
brick
miss
de
lisle
we
used
to
send
them
hampers
before
of
course
but
it
seemed
so
unsatisfactory
just
to
order
them
at
the
stores
it
will
be
ever
so
much
nicer
to
cook
them
things
you
let
me
cook
you
indeed
i
will
said
miss
de
lisle
we
shut
ourselves
up
here
for
a
day
now
and
then
and
have
awful
bouts
of
cookery
how
did
you
like
the
potato
cakes
at
tea
by
the
way
they
were
perfect
norah
said
i
never
tasted
better
even
in
ireland
at
which
katty
who
had
just
entered
with
a
saucepan
blushed
hotly
and
cast
an
ecstatic
glance
at
miss
de
lisle
i
do
suppose
you
did
remarked
that
lady
you
see
katty
made
them
was
she
good
now
to
let
me
miss
norah
katty
asked
them
at
home
that
towld
me
i
get
no
chance
at
all
of
learning
under
a
grand
cook
here
is
little
the
likes
of
them
give
you
to
do
in
the
kitchen
if
you
asked
them
for
a
job
barring
it
was
to
wash
the
floor
they
pitch
you
to
the
sivin
divils
the
scullery
good
enough
for
you
they
say
you
up
with
the
cooking
but
miss
de
lisle
is
one
of
them
and
the
cakes
to
go
up
to
the
itself
well
every
one
liked
them
katty
norah
said
yerra
had
i
bridie
watching
behind
the
big
screen
with
the
crack
in
it
said
the
handmaid
she
come
back
to
me
and
she
says
all
ate
says
she
the
way
ye
had
not
enough
made
she
says
i
did
know
if
was
on
me
head
or
me
heels
i
was
she
bent
a
look
of
adoration
upon
miss
de
lisle
who
laughed
oh
i
make
a
cook
of
you
yet
katty
she
said
meanwhile
better
put
some
coal
on
the
fire
or
the
oven
wo
be
hot
enough
for
my
pastry
is
it
early
breakfast
for
your
brother
and
wally
miss
linton
i
afraid
so
norah
said
jim
said
they
must
leave
at
eight
then
that
means
breakfast
at
will
you
have
yours
with
them
oh
yes
please
if
it
not
too
much
trouble
nothing
a
trouble
certainly
not
an
early
breakfast
said
miss
de
lisle
now
do
worry
about
anything
norah
went
back
to
the
hall
to
find
it
deserted
a
buzz
of
voices
came
from
the
she
peeped
in
to
find
all
the
soldiers
talking
with
her
father
listening
happily
in
a
big
chair
no
one
saw
her
she
withdrew
and
went
in
search
of
west
but
failed
to
find
her
bride
encountered
in
her
evening
tour
with
cans
of
hot
water
reported
that
was
lying
down
she
was
and
not
wishful
for
talk
her
resht
was
more
to
her
then
i
may
as
well
go
and
dress
norah
said
she
had
just
finished
when
a
quick
step
came
along
the
corridor
and
stopped
at
her
door
jim
fingers
beat
the
tattoo
that
was
always
their
signal
come
in
jimmy
norah
cried
he
came
in
looming
huge
in
the
dainty
little
room
good
business
you
dressed
he
said
can
i
come
and
yarn
rather
said
norah
beaming
come
and
sit
down
in
my
armchair
this
electric
heater
is
as
jolly
to
yarn
by
as
a
good
old
log
fire
but
still
it
something
she
pulled
her
chair
forward
ca
you
wait
for
me
to
do
that
bad
kid
said
jim
he
sat
down
and
norah
subsided
on
the
rug
near
him
now
tell
me
all
about
everything
he
said
how
are
things
going
quite
well
especially
atkins
said
norah
in
fact
gone
jim
sat
up
gone
but
how
norah
told
him
the
story
and
he
listened
with
joyful
ejaculations
well
she
was
always
the
black
spot
in
the
house
he
remarked
it
gave
one
the
creeps
to
look
at
her
sour
face
and
i
certain
she
was
more
bother
to
you
than
she
was
worth
oh
i
feel
twenty
years
younger
since
she
went
norah
said
and
it
going
to
be
great
fun
to
housekeep
with
miss
de
lisle
i
shall
learn
ever
so
much
so
will
she
i
imagine
said
jim
laughing
put
her
up
to
all
the
australian
ways
and
see
if
we
ca
make
a
good
emigrant
of
her
when
we
go
back
i
might
norah
said
but
she
would
be
a
shock
to
brownie
if
she
suggested
putting
her
soul
into
a
pudding
rather
said
jim
twinkling
i
say
tell
me
about
hardress
do
you
like
him
oh
yes
ever
so
much
she
told
him
of
her
morning
work
indeed
by
the
time
the
gong
boomed
out
its
summons
from
the
hall
there
was
very
little
in
the
daily
life
of
homewood
that
jim
had
not
managed
to
hear
we
always
wondering
how
you
are
getting
on
he
said
it
jolly
over
there
the
work
is
quite
interesting
and
there
a
very
nice
lot
of
fellows
but
i
like
to
look
in
at
you
two
and
see
how
this
show
was
running
he
hesitated
it
wo
be
long
before
we
go
out
nor
old
chap
wo
it
jimmy
she
put
up
a
hand
and
caught
his
do
you
know
how
long
a
week
or
two
not
more
but
you
not
to
worry
you
just
got
to
think
of
the
day
when
we
get
our
first
leave
and
then
have
to
leave
all
your
tired
people
and
come
and
paint
london
red
he
gave
a
queer
laugh
oh
i
do
know
though
it
seems
to
be
considered
the
right
thing
to
do
but
i
expect
we
just
amble
along
here
and
ask
you
for
a
job
in
the
house
why
you
be
tired
people
yourselves
said
norah
we
have
to
look
after
you
and
give
you
nourishment
at
short
intervals
we
take
that
if
it
miss
de
lisle
cooking
now
do
think
about
this
business
too
much
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
but
nothing
is
definite
yet
perhaps
i
better
not
tell
dad
no
do
he
so
happy
i
wish
i
did
have
to
make
either
of
you
less
happy
jim
said
in
a
troubled
voice
but
it
ca
be
helped
no
i
know
it
ca
jimmy
do
you
worry
dear
old
chap
said
jim
and
stood
up
i
had
better
go
and
make
myself
presentable
before
the
second
gong
goes
he
paused
all
ready
are
you
then
you
might
go
down
wally
will
be
wandering
round
everywhere
looking
for
you
chapter
xi
cheero
it
was
ten
days
later
that
the
summons
to
france
came
ten
days
during
which
the
boys
had
managed
to
make
several
meteoric
dashes
over
to
homewood
for
the
night
and
had
accomplished
one
blissful
during
which
with
the
aid
of
their
they
had
brought
the
household
to
the
verge
of
exhaustion
from
laughter
nothing
could
damp
their
spirits
they
rode
and
danced
sang
and
joked
and
apparently
having
no
cares
in
the
world
themselves
were
determined
that
no
one
else
should
have
any
the
hunt
family
were
drawn
into
the
fun
the
kitchen
was
frequently
invaded
and
miss
de
lisle
declared
that
even
her
was
not
sacred
and
was
privately
very
delighted
that
it
was
not
allenby
began
to
develop
a
regrettable
lack
of
control
over
his
once
stolid
features
sarah
herself
was
observed
to
stuff
her
apron
into
her
mouth
and
rush
from
the
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
under
cover
of
his
most
energetic
fooling
jim
linton
watched
his
father
and
sister
and
fooled
the
more
happily
whenever
he
made
them
laugh
they
arrived
together
unexpectedly
on
this
last
evening
preferring
to
bring
their
news
rather
than
give
it
by
telephone
and
found
instead
of
the
usual
cheery
in
the
hall
only
silence
and
emptiness
allenby
appearing
broke
into
a
broad
smile
of
pleasure
as
he
greeted
them
every
one
out
mr
jim
so
it
seems
jim
answered
where
are
they
not
very
far
sir
allenby
said
has
them
all
to
tea
with
her
oh
we
go
over
wal
jim
said
come
and
make
yourself
pretty

splash
of
mud
on
your
downy
cheek
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs

allenby

jim
said
pleasantly
he
sprang
upstairs
after
wally
hunt
was
already
dangerously
crowded
there
seemed
no
room
at
all
for
the
two
tall
lads
for
whom
eva
opened
the
door
ten
minutes
later
a
chorus
of
welcome
greeted
them
nevertheless
this
is
delightful
said
hunt
i
sure
i
do
know
how
you
going
to
fit
in
but
you
must
manage
it
somehow
if
necessary
we
all
stand
up
and
ourselves
but
i
warn
you
it
is
risky
the
walls
may
not
stand
it
oh
do
trouble
hunt
jim
said
we
quite
all
right
both
boys
eyes
had
sought
norah
as
they
entered
and
norah
meeting
the
glance
felt
a
sudden
pang
at
her
heart
and
knew
my
chair
is
ever
so
much
too
big
for
me
she
said
you
can
each
have
an
arm
good
idea
said
wally
perching
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
that
swallowed
her
up
come
along
jim
or

be
we
put
norah
in
the
biggest
chair
in
the
room
and
everybody

treating
her
with
profound
respect
hunt
said
this
is
the
first
day
for
quite
a
while
that
she
has
been
hostess
so
we
made
her
chief
guest
and
she
is

a
if

a
restful
effect
on
her
said
wally
i
tried
to
which
norah
inquired
when
in
a
voice
of
such
amazement
that
every
one
laughed
misunderstood

wally
pathetically

one
geoffrey
admitted
he
cantered
before

i
fell

but
it
did
hurt
that

practise
always
falling

a
soft
spot
and
you
need
never
worry
but

geoffrey
it

that

is
a
war
on
said
major
hunt
aggrieved
i
found
him
gnawing
the
strap
of
one
of
my
gaiters
the
other
day

underfeed
the
poor
kid

wally

run
she
cast
an
inquiring
eye
round
the
room
some
more
tea
norah
no
thank
you
mrs
hunt
norah
voice
sounded
strange
in
her
own
ears
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
room
and
the
chatter
to
make
sure
though
she
was
sure
already
the
guns
of
france
seemed
to
sound
very
near
her
the
party
broke
up
after
a
while
jim
and
wally
lingered
behind
the
others
will

real
home

she
watched
them
stride
off
into
the
shrubbery
and
choked
back
a
sigh
norah
came
back
to
them
through
the
trees
it
marching
orders
is
it
yes
it
marching
orders
old
kiddie
jim
answered
they
looked
at
each
other
steadily
and
then
norah
eyes
met
wally
when
she
asked
morning
well
said
norah
and
drew
a
long
breath
and
i
have
your
last
week
socks
darned
that
comes
of
having
too
many
responsibilities
any
buttons
to
be
sewn
on
for
either
of
you
no
thanks
they
told
her
greatly
relieved
she
tucked
a
hand
into
an
arm
of
each
boy
and
they
went
towards
the
house
david
linton
came
out
hurriedly
to
meet
them
allenby
says
he
began
he
did
not
need
to
go
further
we
were
trotting
in
to
tell
you

jim

just
in
time

cheery
christmas

i

lucky
pig
and
a
button
and
a
in

so

and
i
are

parcels
for

she
going
to
teach
me
to
cook
all
sorts
of
things
after
which
you
try
them
on
the
dogs
meaning
us
jim
said
laughing
well
if
we
do
go
into
hospital
after
them
we
let
you
know
they
came
into
the
house
where
already
the
news
of
the
boys
going
had
spread
and
the
as
wally
called
their
guests
were
waiting
to
wish
them
luck
then
everybody
faded
away
unobtrusively
and
left
them
to
themselves
they
went
into
the
and
norah
darned
socks
vigorously
while
the
boys
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
cheery
talk
whatever
was
to
come
they
would
meet
it
with
their
heads
up
all
four
they
made
dinner
a
revel
every
one
dressed
in
their
best
and
to
their
utmost
while
miss
de
lisle
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
had
wept
had
sent
up
a
dinner
which
really
left
her
very
little
extra
chance
of
celebrating
peace
when
that
most
blessed
day
should
come
over
dessert
colonel
west
rose
unexpectedly
and
made
a
little
speech
proposing
the
health
of
the
boys
who
sat
for
the
first
time
with
utterly
miserable
faces
restraining
an
inclination
to
get
under
the
table
i
am
sure
said
the
colonel
that
we
all
wish
the
ah
greatest
of
luck
to
our
host
sons
ah
that
is
to
his
son
and
to
ah
his
ah
encumbrance
said
wally
firmly
quite
said
the
colonel
without
listening
we
know
they
will
ah
make
things
hot
for
the
boche
ah
whenever
they
get
a
chance
i
we
hope
they
will
get
plenty
of
chances
and
ah
that
we
will
see
them
ah
back
with
decorations
and
promotion
we
will
miss
them
ah
very
much
speaking
ah
personally
i
came
here
fit
for
nothing
and
have
ah
laughed
so
much
that
i
ah
could
almost
believe
myself
a
subaltern
the
tired
people
applauded
energetically
and
west
said
quite
quite
but
there
was
something
like
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
it
the
hunts
arrived
after
dinner
and
they
all
woke
the
house
with
ringing
choruses
echoed
by
allenby
in
his
pantry
as
he
polished
the
silver
and
garrett
sang
a
song
which
was
not
encored
because
something
in
his
silver
tenor
made
a
lump
come
into
norah
throat
and
there
was
no
room
for
that
of
all
nights
jack
blake
sang
them
a
stockrider
song
with
a
chorus
in
which
all
the
australians
joined
and
dick
harrison
recited
the
geebung
polo
club
without
any
elocutionary
tricks
and
brought
down
the
house
jim
had
slipped
out
to
speak
to
allenby
and
presently
going
out
they
found
the
hall
cleared
and
the
floor
waxed
for
dancing
they
danced
to
gramophone
music
manipulated
by
linton
and
norah
and
hunt
had
to
divide
each
dance
into
three
except
those
with
jim
and
wally
which
they
refused
to
partition
regardless
of
disconsolate
protests
from
the
other
warriors
it
was
eleven
when
allenby
announced
stolidly
supper
is
served
sir
supper
said
linton
how
this
norah
do
know
said
his
daughter
ask
miss
de
lisle
they
filed
in
to
find
a
table
laden
and
glittering
in
the
centre
a
huge
cake
bearing
the
greeting
good
luck
with
a
silken
union
jack
waving
proudly
norah
whispered
to
her
father
and
then
ran
away
she
returned
presently
dragging
the
it
against
my
rules
protested
the
captive
rules
be
hanged
said
jim
cheerfully
just
you
sit
there
miss
de
lisle
and
the
found
herself
beside
colonel
west
who
paid
her
great
attention
regarding
her
against
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
as
a
tired
person
whom
he
had
not
previously
chanced
to
meet
my
poor
neglected
babies
said
hunt
tragically
as
twelve
strokes
chimed
from
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
wally
and
norah
crowned
with
blue
and
scarlet
paper
caps
the
treasure
of
crackers
were
performing
a
weird
dance
which
they
called
with
no
very
good
reason
a
tango
it
might
have
been
anything
but
it
satisfied
the
performers
the
music
stopped
suddenly
and
linton
wound
up
the
gramophone
for
the
last
time
slipping
on
a
new
record
the
notes
of
auld
lang
syne
stole
out
they
gathered
round
holding
hands
while
they
sang
it
singing
with
all
their
lungs
and
all
their
hearts
norah
between
jim
and
wally
feeling
her
fingers
crushed
in
each
boyish
grip
then
here
a
hand
my
trusty
friend
and
gie
a
hand
o
thine
over
the
music
her
heart
listened
to
the
booming
of
the
guns
across
the
channel
but
she
set
her
lips
and
sang
on
it
was
morning
and
they
were
on
the
station
the
train
came
slowly
round
the
corner
i
look
after
him
nor
wally
voice
shook
do
worry
too
much
old
girl
and
yourself
too
she
said
oh
i
keep
an
eye
on
said
jim
and
dad
your
job
and
we
plan
all
sorts
of
things
for
your
next
leave
said
david
linton
god
bless
you
boys
they
gripped
hands
then
jim
put
his
arms
round
norah
shoulder
you
keep
smiling
kiddie
whatever
comes
yes
i
promise
jimmy
the
guard
was
shouting
all
aboard
cheero
norah
wally
cried
from
the
window
we
be
back
in
no
time
cheero
she
made
the
word
come
somehow
the
train
roared
off
round
the
curve
chapter
xii
of
labour
and
promotion
the
months
went
by
quickly
enough
as
david
linton
and
his
daughter
settled
down
to
their
work
at
the
home
for
tired
people
as
the
place
became
more
widely
known
they
had
rarely
an
empty
room
the
regiment
sent
them
many
a
wearied
officer
too
fagged
in
mind
and
body
to
enjoy
his
leave
the
hospitals
kept
up
a
constant
supply
of
convalescent
and
maimed
patients
and
there
was
a
steady
stream
of
australians
of
all
ranks
who
came
homesick
for
their
own
land
and
found
a
little
corner
of
it
planted
in
the
heart
of
surrey
gradually
as
the
lintons
realized
the
full
extent
of
the
homesickness
of
the
lads
from
overseas
homewood
became
more
and
more
australian
in
details
pictures
from
every
state
appeared
on
the
walls
aboriginal
weapons
and
curiosities
woven
grass
mats
from
the
natives
of
queensland
australian
books
and
magazines
and
papers
all
were
scattered
about
the
house
they
filled
vases
with
leaves
and
golden
from
the
south
of
france
norah
even
discovered
a
flowering
boronia
in
a
kew
nurseryman
greenhouse
and
carried
it
off
in
triumph
to
scent
the
house
with
the
unforgettable
delight
of
its
perfume
she
never
afterwards
saw
a
boronia
without
recalling
the
bewilderment
of
her
in
the
railway
carriage
at
her
burden
you
should
have
seen
their
wondering
noses
dad
said
norah
chuckling
no
one
of
course
stayed
very
long
at
homewood
unless
he
were
hopelessly
unfit
from
ten
days
to
three
weeks
was
the
average
stay
then
like
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
the
drifted
away
but
very
few
forgot
them
little
notes
came
from
the
fronts
in
green
active
service
envelopes
postcards
from
mediterranean
ports
letters
from
east
and
west
africa
grateful
letters
from
wives
in
garrison
stations
and
training
camps
throughout
the
british
isles
they
accumulated
an
extraordinary
collection
of
photographs
in
uniform
and
norah
had
an
autograph
book
with
scrawled
signatures
peculiar
drawings
and
an
occasional
scrap
of
very
bad
verse
major
hunt
his
hand
fully
recovered
returned
to
the
front
in
february
and
his
wife
prepared
to
seek
another
home
but
the
lintons
flatly
refused
to
let
her
go
we
could
do
it
said
david
linton
does
the
place
agree
with
the
babies
oh
you
know
it
does
said
hunt
but
we
have
already
kept
the
cottage
far
too
long
there
are
other
people
not
for
that
cottage
norah
said
it
really
is
fair
protested
their
guest
douglas
never
dreamed
of
our
staying
if
he
had
not
been
sent
out
in
such
a
hurry
at
the
last
he
would
have
moved
us
himself
david
linton
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
go
and
play
with
the
babies
norah
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
this
obstinate
person
now
look
hunt
he
said
as
norah
went
off
rather
relieved
norah
hated
arguments
you
know
we
run
this
place
for
an
ideal
a
dead
man
ideal
wanted
more
than
anything
in
the
world
to
help
the
war
we
merely
carrying
on
for
him
we
can
only
do
it
by
helping
individuals
but
you
have
done
that
for
us
look
at
douglas
strong
and
fit
with
one
hand
as
good
as
the
other
think
of
what
he
was
when
he
came
here
he
may
not
always
be
fit
and
if
you
stay
here
you
ease
his
worries
by
benefiting
his
children
and
saving
for
their
future
then
if
he
has
the
bad
luck
to
be
wounded
again
his
house
is
all
ready
for
him
i
know
she
said
and
i
would
stay
but
that
there
are
others
who
need
it
more
well
we
have
heard
of
them
look
at
it
another
way
i
am
getting
an
old
man
it
worries
me
a
good
deal
to
think
that
norah
has
no
woman
to
mother
her
i
used
to
think
he
said
with
a
sigh
that
it
was
worse
for
them
to
lose
their
own
mother
when
they
were
wee
things
now
i
am
not
sure
that
norah
loss
is
not
just
beginning
it
no
small
thing
for
her
to
have
an
influence
like
yours
and
norah
loves
you
hunt
flushed
indeed
i
love
her
she
said
then
stay
and
mother
her
there
are
ever
so
many
things
you
can
teach
her
that
i
ca
that
miss
de
lisle
ca
good
soul
as
she
is
they
not
things
i
can
put
into
words
but
you
understand
i
know
she
clean
and
wholesome
right
through
but
you
can
help
to
mould
her
for
womanhood
of
course
she
left
school
far
too
early
but
there
seemed
no
help
for
it
and
if
if
bad
news
comes
to
us
from
the
front
for
any
of
us
we
can
all
help
each
other
hunt
thought
deeply
if
you
really
think
i
can
be
of
use
i
will
stay
she
said
i
not
going
to
speak
of
gratitude
i
tried
to
say
all
that
long
ago
but
indeed
i
will
do
what
i
can
that
all
right
i
very
glad
said
david
linton
and
if
you
really
want
her
taught
more
hunt
said
well
i
was
a
governess
with
fairly
high
certificates
before
i
was
married
she
could
come
to
me
for
literature
and
french
i
was
brought
up
in
paris
her
music
too
she
really
should
practise
with
her
talent
i
like
it
above
all
things
exclaimed
linton
neglected
education
has
been
worrying
me
badly
we
plan
it
out
hunt
said
now
i
feel
much
happier
norah
did
not
need
much
persuasion
after
the
first
moment
of
dismay
at
the
idea
of
renewed
lessons
she
saw
the
advantages
of
the
plan
helped
by
the
fact
that
she
was
always
a
little
afraid
of
failing
to
come
up
to
jim
standard
a
fear
which
would
considerably
have
amazed
jim
had
he
but
guessed
it
it
was
easy
enough
to
fit
hours
of
study
into
her
day
she
rose
early
to
practise
before
the
tired
people
were
awake
and
most
mornings
saw
her
reading
with
hunt
or
chattering
french
while
eva
sang
shrilly
in
the
kitchen
and
the
babies
slept
in
their
white
bunks
and
geoffrey
followed
linton
heels
either
on
brecon
or
afoot
the
big
australian
squatter
and
the
little
english
boy
had
become
great
friends
there
was
something
in
the
tiny
lad
that
recalled
the
jim
of
long
ago
with
his
figure
and
steady
eyes
one
man
alone
out
of
all
tired
people
had
never
left
homewood
for
a
time
after
his
arrival
philip
hardress
had
gained
steadily
in
strength
and
energy
then
a
chill
had
thrown
him
back
and
for
months
he
sagged
downwards
never
very
ill
but
always
losing
vitality
the
old
depression
seemed
to
come
back
to
him
tenfold
he
could
see
nothing
good
in
life
a
cripple
a
useless
cripple
his
parents
were
dead
save
for
a
brother
in
salonica
he
was
alone
in
the
world
he
was
always
courteous
always
gentle
but
a
wall
of
misery
seemed
to
cut
him
off
from
the
household
then
the
magnificent
physique
of
the
boy
asserted
itself
and
gradually
he
grew
stronger
and
the
hacking
cough
left
him
again
it
became
possible
to
tempt
him
to
try
to
ride
he
spent
hours
in
the
keen
wintry
air
jogging
round
the
fields
and
lanes
with
linton
and
geoffrey
returning
with
something
of
the
light
in
his
eyes
that
had
encouraged
norah
in
his
first
morning
long
ago
i
believe
all
he
wants
is
to
get
interested
in
something
norah
said
watching
him
one
day
as
he
sat
on
the
stone
wall
of
the
terrace
looking
across
the
park
he
was
at
oxford
before
he
joined
the
army
was
he
dad
linton
assented
his
people
arranged
when
he
was
little
that
he
should
be
a
barrister
but
he
hated
the
idea
his
own
wish
was
to
go
out
to
canada
norah
pondered
could
you
give
him
a
job
on
the
farm
dad
i
do
know
said
her
father
i
never
thought
of
it
i
suppose
i
might
find
him
something
to
do
hawkins
and
i
will
be
busy
enough
presently
he
beginning
to
worry
at
being
here
so
long
norah
said
of
course
we
could
possibly
let
him
go
he
is
fit
for
his
own
society
i
think
if
you
could
find
him
some
work
he
would
be
more
content
so
david
linton
after
thinking
the
matter
over
took
hardress
into
his
plans
for
the
farm
which
was
to
be
the
main
source
of
supply
for
homewood
he
found
him
a
quick
and
intelligent
helper
the
work
was
after
the
boy
own
heart
he
surrounded
himself
with
agricultural
books
and
treaties
on
fertilizers
made
a
study
of
soils
and
took
samples
of
earth
from
different
parts
of
the
farm
to
the
profound
disgust
of
hawkins
war
had
not
done
away
with
all
expert
agricultural
science
in
england
hardress
sent
his
little
packets
of
soil
away
and
received
them
back
with
advice
as
to
treatment
which
later
on
resulted
in
the
yield
of
the
land
being
doubled
which
hawkins
attributed
solely
to
his
own
skill
as
a
cultivator
but
the
cure
was
worked
in
philip
hardress
the
ring
of
hope
came
back
into
his
voice
the
dragged
ever
so
little
as
he
walked
across
the
park
daily
to
where
the
ploughs
were
turning
the
grass
of
the
farm
fields
into
stretches
of
brown
dotted
with
white
gulls
that
followed
the
horses
slow
plodding
up
and
down
the
other
guests
took
up
a
good
deal
of
linton
time
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
an
overseer
since
hawkins
while
honest
and
painstaking
was
not
afflicted
with
any
undue
allowance
of
brains
together
in
the
study
at
night
they
planned
out
the
farm
into
little
crops
already
much
of
the
land
was
ready
for
the
planting
and
a
model
built
near
the
house
was
stocked
with
birds
while
a
flock
of
sheep
grazed
in
the
park
and
to
the
tiny
herd
of
cows
had
been
added
half
a
dozen
jerseys
david
linton
had
taken
hardress
with
him
on
the
trip
to
buy
the
stock
and
both
had
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
meanwhile
the
boys
at
the
front
sent
long
and
cheery
letters
almost
daily
astonishment
had
come
to
them
almost
as
soon
as
they
rejoined
in
finding
themselves
promoted
they
gazed
at
their
second
stars
in
bewilderment
which
was
scarcely
lessened
by
the
fact
that
their
friends
in
the
regiment
were
not
at
all
surprised
why
did
you
have
a
war
on
your
own
account
in
ireland
queried
anstruther
you
got
a
boche
submarine
sunk
and
caught
half
the
crew
did
you
well
but
that
was
only
a
lark
said
wally
you
were
wounded
anyhow
young
meadows
of
course
know
jolly
well
you
do
deserve
anything
but
you
ca
expect
the
war
office
to
have
our
intimate
sources
of
information
he
patted
wally
on
the
back
painfully
just
be
jolly
thankful
you
get
more
screw
and
grumble
no
one
ever
teach
sense
to
the
war
office
there
was
no
lack
of
occupation
in
their
part
of
the
line
they
saw
a
good
deal
of
fighting
and
achieved
some
reputation
as
leaders
of
small
raids
jim
in
particular
having
a
power
of
seeing
and
hearing
at
night
that
had
been
developed
in
long
years
in
the
bush
but
which
seemed
to
the
englishmen
almost
uncanny
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
the
enemy
felt
even
more
strongly
about
it
there
was
seldom
rest
for
the
weary
boche
in
the
trenches
opposite
jim
linton
section
some
of
his
raids
were
authorized
others
were
not
it
is
probable
that
the
latter
variety
was
more
discouraging
to
the
enemy
behind
the
fighting
line
they
were
in
fairly
comfortable
billets
the
officers
were
hardworked
the
daily
programme
of
drill
and
parades
was
heavy
and
in
addition
there
was
the
task
of
keeping
the
men
interested
and
fit
no
easy
matter
in
the
bitter
cold
of
a
north
france
winter
jim
proved
a
tower
of
strength
to
his
company
commander
as
he
had
been
to
his
school
he
organized
football
teams
and
taught
them
the
australian
game
he
appealed
to
his
father
for
aid
and
in
prompt
response
out
came
cases
of
hockey
and
lacrosse
sets
and
footballs
enough
to
keep
every
man
going
norah
sent
a
special
gift
a
big
case
of
indoor
games
for
wet
weather
with
a
splendid
bagatelle
board
that
made
the
battalion
deeply
envied
by
less
fortunate
neighbours
until
a
german
shell
disobligingly
burst
just
above
it
and
reduced
it
to
fragments
however
norah
disgust
at
the
news
was
so
deep
that
the
tired
people
in
residence
at
homewood
at
the
moment
conspired
together
and
supplied
the
battalion
with
a
new
board
in
her
name
and
this
time
it
managed
to
escape
destruction
the
battalion
had
some
stiff
fighting
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
and
earned
a
pat
on
the
back
from
high
quarters
for
its
work
in
capturing
some
enemy
trenches
but
they
lost
heavily
especially
in
officers
jim
company
commander
was
killed
at
his
side
the
boy
went
out
at
night
into
land
and
brought
his
body
in
in
grim
defiance
of
the
boche
jim
had
liked
anstruther
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
that
his
body
should
be
dishonoured
by
the
touch
of
a
hun
next
day
he
had
a
far
harder
task
for
anstruther
had
asked
him
to
write
to
his
mother
if
he
failed
to
come
back
jim
bit
his
pen
for
two
hours
over
that
letter
and
in
his
own
mind
stigmatized
it
as
a
rotten
effort
after
it
was
finished
but
the
woman
to
whom
it
carried
whatever
of
comfort
was
left
in
the
world
for
her
saw
no
fault
in
it
it
was
worn
and
frayed
with
reading
when
she
locked
it
away
with
her
dead
son
letters
jim
found
himself
a
company
commander
after
that
day
fighting
doing
captain
work
without
captain
rank
wally
was
his
subaltern
an
arrangement
rather
doubted
at
first
by
the
colonel
until
he
saw
that
the
chums
played
the
game
strictly
and
maintained
in
working
hours
a
discipline
as
firm
as
was
their
friendship
the
men
adored
them
they
knew
their
officers
shirked
neither
work
nor
play
and
that
they
knew
their
own
limitations
neither
jim
nor
wally
ever
deluded
themselves
with
the
idea
that
they
knew
as
much
as
their
officers
but
they
learned
their
men
by
heart
knowing
each
one
nickname
and
something
of
his
private
affairs
losing
no
opportunity
of
talking
to
them
and
gaining
their
confidence
and
sizing
them
up
as
they
talked
just
as
in
old
days
as
captains
of
the
team
they
had
learned
to
size
up
boys
at
football
if
got
to
go
over
the
top
i
want
to
know
what
joe
wilkins
and
tiny
judd
are
doing
behind
me
said
jim
they
had
hoped
for
leave
before
the
spring
offensive
but
it
was
impossible
the
battalion
was
too
shorthanded
and
the
enemy
was
endeavouring
to
be
the
man
who
gets
his
fist
in
fust
in
that
early
fighting
it
became
necessary
to
deal
with
a
nest
of
that
had
got
the
range
of
their
trenches
to
a
nicety
shells
had
failed
to
find
them
and
the
list
of
casualties
to
their
discredit
mounted
daily
higher
jim
got
the
chance
he
shook
hands
with
wally
a
vision
of
miserable
disappointment
in
the
small
hours
of
a
starlit
night
and
led
a
picked
body
of
his
men
out
of
the
front
trench
making
a
long
and
finally
working
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
spot
he
had
studied
through
his
periscope
for
hours
during
the
day
then
he
planted
his
men
in
a
and
wriggled
forward
alone
the
men
lay
waiting
inwardly
chafing
at
being
left
presently
their
officer
came
crawling
back
to
them
we
got
cold
he
whispered
come
along
and
do
fire
a
shot
it
was
long
after
daylight
before
the
german
guards
in
the
main
trenches
suspected
anything
wrong
with
that
particular
nest
of
and
marvelled
at
its
silence
for
there
was
no
one
left
to
tell
them
anything
of
the
fierce
silent
onslaught
from
the
rear
of
men
who
dropped
as
it
were
from
the
clouds
and
fought
with
clubbed
rifles
led
by
a
boy
who
seemed
in
the
starlight
as
tall
as
a
young
the
were
sleeping
and
most
of
them
never
woke
again
the
guards
drowsy
in
the
quiet
stillness
heard
nothing
until
that
swift
wordless
avalanche
was
upon
them
in
the
british
trench
there
was
impatience
and
anxiety
the
men
waiting
to
go
forward
if
necessary
to
support
the
raiders
crouched
at
the
muttering
wally
sick
with
suspense
peered
forward
beside
the
colonel
who
had
come
in
person
to
see
the
result
of
the
raid
i
believe
they
missed
their
way
altogether
muttered
the
colonel
angrily
there
should
hove
been
shots
long
ago
it
is
like
linton
dawn
will
be
here
soon
and
the
whole
lot
will
be
scuppered
he
wheeled
at
a
sudden
commotion
beyond
him
in
the
trench
silence
there
what
that
that
was
jim
linton
and
his
warriors
very
muddy
but
otherwise
undamaged
they
dropped
into
the
trench
quietly
those
who
came
first
turning
to
receive
heavy
objects
from
those
yet
on
top
last
of
all
jim
hopped
down
hullo
wal
he
whispered
got
got
said
the
colonel
sternly
what
where
have
you
been
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
did
know
you
were
there
jim
said
rather
horrified
it
is
not
given
to
every
subaltern
to
call
his
commanding
officer
wal
when
that
is
not
his
name
i
have
the
guns
sir
you
have
the
boche
i
mean
the
enemy
we
brought
them
back
sir
you
brought
them
back
the
colonel
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
trench
and
began
to
laugh
helplessly
and
your
men
all
here
sir
we
brought
the
ammunition
too
said
jim
mildly
it
seemed
a
pity
to
waste
it
which
things
being
told
in
high
places
brought
jim
a
mention
in
despatches
and
shortly
afterwards
confirmation
of
his
acting
rank
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
fitting
words
to
tell
of
the
effect
of
this
matter
upon
a
certain
grizzled
gentleman
and
a
very
young
lady
who
when
the
information
reached
them
were
studying
patent
manures
in
a
in
a
house
in
surrey
he
why
gasped
norah
incredulously
he
actually
captain
linton
i
suppose
he
is
said
her
father
does
it
sound
ridiculous
i
do
think
it
ridiculous
at
all
said
norah
warmly
he
deserved
it
i
think
it
sounds
simply
beautiful
do
you
know
said
her
father
somewhat
embarrassed
i
really
believe
i
agree
with
you
he
laughed
captain
linton
captain
linton
reiterated
norah
our
old
jimmy
she
swept
the
table
clear
oh
daddy
bother
the
fertilizers
for
going
to
write
to
billabong
but
it
is
protested
her
father
mildly
no
said
norah
but
i
explode
if
i
do
tell
brownie
and
will
the
captain
be
coming
soon
miss
norah
inquired
allenby
a
little
later
the
household
had
waxed
ecstatic
over
the
news
the
captain
norah
echoed
oh
how
nice
of
you
allenby
it
does
sound
jolly
miss
de
lisle
wishes
to
know
miss
the
news
induced
to
invent
a
special
cake
we
have
to
send
it
to
the
poor
captain
i
afraid
said
norah
dimpling
dear
me
i
have
told
hunt
i
must
fly
she
dropped
her
pen
and
fled
to
the
cottage
to
find
her
father
there
before
her
i
might
have
known
you
could
wait
to
tell
said
norah
laughing
and
he
pretends
he
is
proud
mrs
hunt
i
given
up
even
pretending
said
her
father
laughing
i
found
myself
shaking
hands
with
allenby
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
you
see
hunt
this
sort
of
thing
has
happened
in
the
family
before
oh
but
those
boys
could
help
doing
well
hunt
said
looking
almost
as
pleased
as
the
two
beaming
faces
before
her
they
so
keen
i
do
know
if
i
should
but
shall
i
read
you
what
douglas
says
about
them
they
gathered
eagerly
together
over
the
curt
words
of
praise
major
hunt
had
written
quite
ordinary
boys
and
not
a
bit
brainy
he
finished
but
i
wish
i
had
a
regiment
full
of
them
out
in
australia
two
months
later
a
huge
old
woman
and
a
lean
irishman
talked
over
the
letter
norah
had
at
length
managed
to
finish
and
it
a
captin
he
is
said
murty
head
stockman
a
captain
brownie
echoed
do
it
seem
only
yesterday
he
was
tearing
about
in
his
first
little
trousis
and
the
little
mistress
watching
him
and
riding
his
first
pony
she
put
him
over
her
head
and
i
med
sure
he
was
kilt
her
will

he
stamping
his
little
fut
and
blood
trickling
down
his
face
me
a
leg
up
again
he
says
we
see
who
boss
and
i
put
him
up
and
off
he
went
down
the
paddock
digging
his
little
heels
into
her
and
a
captin

six
months
ago

xiii
the

of
a
perfect
day

ready
norah
coming
phil
half
a
minute
hardress
in
riding
kit
looked
into
the
kitchen
where
norah
was
carrying
on
a
feverish
consultation
with
miss
de
lisle
you
be
late
he
said
warningly

father

geoffrey

distractedly

to
me
said
miss
de
lisle
laughing
if
i
manage
to
worry
out
a
fish
course
without

i
do
deserve
to
have
half
my
diplomas
run
away
the
house
wo
go
to
pieces
in
a
single
hunting
day
bless
you
said
norah
thankfully
dragging
on
her
gloves
and
casting
a
wild
glance
about
the
kitchen
for
her
hunting
crop
oh
there
it
is
you
wo
forget
that
major
arkwright
is
only
allowed
white
meat
oh

wo
forget

well
he
only
came
last
night
so
i
thought
you
might
know
said
the
apologetic
mistress
of
the
house
all
right
phil
i
truly
coming
miss
de
lisle
the
words
floated
back
as
she
raced
off
to
the
front
door
where
the
horses
were
fretting
impatiently
held
by
the
groom
they
jogged
down
the
avenue
hardress
on
one
of
the
brown
cobs
norah
on
brunette
the
black
pony
her
favourite
mount
it
was
a
perfect
hunting
morning
mild
and
still
with
almost
a
hint
of
spring
warmth
in
the
air
the
leafless
trees
bore
faint
signs
of
swelling
here
and
there
in
the
grass
beside
the
drive
crocus
bells
peeped
out
at
them
purple
white
and
gold
we
have
daffodils
soon
i
do
believe
norah
said
well
i
love
australia
but
there
is
anything
in
the
world
lovelier
than
your
english
spring
ahead
of
them
as
they
turned
into
the
road
they
could
see
linton
looking
extraordinarily
huge
on
killaloe
beside
little
figure
on
brecon
this
is
a
great
day
for
geoff
hardress
said
yes
he
has
been
just
longing
to
go
to
a
meet
of
course
he
has
driven
a
good
many
times
but
hunt
has
been
a
bit
nervous
about
his
riding
but
he
perfectly
safe
and
it
is
as
if
brecon
ever
got
excited
no
come
along
norah
there
a
splendid
stretch
of
grass
here
let
canter
they
had
agreed
upon
a
footing
some
time
before
when
it
seemed
that
hardress
was
likely
to
be
a
permanent
member
of
the
household
she
looked
at
him
now
as
they
cantered
along
through
the
grass
at
the
side
of
the
road
no
one
would
have
guessed
at
anything
wrong
with
him
he
was
bronzed
and
and
sat
as
easily
in
the
saddle
as
though
he
had
never
been
injured
sometimes
said
norah
suddenly
i
find
myself
wondering
which
of
your
legs
is
the
shop
one
she
flushed
i
suppose
i
ought
to
make
personal
remarks
but
your
leg
does
seem
family
property
so
it
is
said
hardress
grinning
anyhow
you
could
make
a
nicer
personal
remark
than
that
one
so
i
forgive
you
but
it
all
thanks
to
you
people
we
could
have
done
anything
if
you
had
been
determined
to
get
on
norah
answered
as
soon
as
you
made
up
your
mind
to
that
well
you
got
on
i
do
know
how
you
stood
me
so
long
he
muttered
then
they
caught
up
to
the
riders
ahead
and
were
received
by
geoffrey
with
a
joyful
shout
you
were
nearly
late
norah
said
linton
i
dragged
her
from
the
kitchen
sir
hardress
said
she
and
miss
de
lisle
were
poring
over
food
if
we
get
no
dinner
it
will
be
our
fault
if
had
the
responsibility
of
feeding
fourteen
hungry
people
you
would
make
a
joke
of
it
said
norah
it
very
solemn
especially
when
the
fishmonger
fails
you
hopelessly
there
always
tinned
salmon
suggested
her
father
tinned
salmon
indeed
norah
voice
was
scornful
we
come
yet
to
giving
the
tired
people
dinner
out
of
a
tin
however
it
all
right
miss
de
lisle
will
work
some
sort
of
a
miracle
not
going
to
think
of
housekeeping
for
a
whole
day
the
meet
was
four
miles
away
near
a
marshy
hollow
thickly
covered
with
osiers
and
willows
a
wood
fringed
the
marsh
and
covered
a
hill
which
rose
from
a
little
stream
beyond
it
here
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
the
yellow
flame
of
gorse
there
were
rolling
fields
all
round
many
of
them
ploughed
it
had
not
yet
been
made
compulsory
for
every
landowner
to
till
a
portion
of
his
holding
but
english
farmers
were
beginning
to
awake
to
the
fact
that
while
the
german
submarine
flourished
it
would
be
both
prudent
and
profitable
to
grow
as
much
food
as
possible
and
the
plough
had
been
busy
the
gate
into
the
field
overlooking
the
marsh
stood
open
a
few
riders
were
converging
towards
it
from
different
points
the
old
days
of
crowded
meets
and
big
fields
of
riders
were
gone
only
a
few
plucky
people
struggled
to
keep
the
hounds
going
and
to
find
work
for
the
hunters
that
had
escaped
the
first
requisition
of
horses
for
france
the
hounds
came
into
view
as
linton
party
arrived
the
master
came
first
on
a
big
workmanlike
grey
a
tall
woman
with
a
weatherbeaten
face
surmounted
by
a
bowler
hat
the
hounds
trotted
meekly
after
her
one
or
another
pausing
now
and
then
to
drink
at
a
wayside
puddle
before
being
rebuked
for
bad
manners
by
a
watchful
whip
ainslie
liked
the
lintons
she
greeted
them
pleasantly
nice
morning
she
said
congratulations
i
hear
the
boy
is
a
captain
we
ca
quite
realize
it
norah
said
laughing
you
see
we
hardly
knew
he
had
grown
up
well
he
grew
to
a
good
size
said
ainslie
with
a
smile
hullo
geoff
are
you
going
to
follow
they
wo
let
me
said
geoffrey
dolefully
i
know
brecon
and
i
could
but
mother
says
we
too
small
too
bad
said
ainslie
never
mind
you
be
big
pretty
soon
a
tall
old
man
in
knickerbockers
greeted
her
squire
brand
who
owned
a
famous
property
a
few
miles
away
and
who
had
the
reputation
of
never
missing
a
meet
although
he
did
not
ride
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
country
it
was
said
that
he
could
boast
at
the
end
of
a
season
that
he
had
on
the
whole
seen
more
of
the
runs
than
any
one
else
except
the
master
he
was
a
tireless
runner
with
an
extraordinarily
long
stride
which
carried
him
over
fields
and
ditches
and
gave
him
the
advantage
of
many
a
short
cut
impossible
to
most
people
he
knew
every
hound
by
name
some
said
he
knew
every
fox
in
the
country
and
he
certainly
had
an
amazing
knowledge
of
the
direction
a
fox
was
likely
to
take
horses
on
the
other
hand
bored
him
hopelessly
he
consented
to
drive
them
in
the
days
when
motors
were
not
but
merely
as
a
means
of
getting
from
place
to
place
a
splendid
car
with
a
chauffeur
much
smarter
than
his
master
had
just
dropped
him
a
grant
figure
in
weatherbeaten
harris
tweeds
grasping
a
heavy
stick
we
should
get
a
good
run
he
said
yes
with
luck
ainslie
answered
any
news
from
the
colonel
nothing
in
particular
plenty
of
hard
fighting
but
he
never
writes
much
of
that
he
much
more
interested
in
a
run
he
had
with
a
queer
scratch
pack
near
their
billets
i
ca
quite
gather
how
it
was
organized
but
it
comprised
two
beagles
and
a
greyhound
and
a
and
a
pug
he
said
they
had
a
very
sporting
time
squire
brand
chuckled
i
do
doubt
it
he
said
did
he
say
what
they
hunted
anything
they
could
get
apparently
they
began
with
a
hare
and
then
got
on
to
a
rabbit
in
some
mysterious
fashion
they
finished
up
with
a
brisk
run
in
the
outskirts
of
a
village
and
got
a
kill
it
turned
out
this
time
to
be
a
cat
ainslie
rather
grim
features
relaxed
into
a
smile
if
any
one
had
told
val
two
years
ago
that
he
would
be
enthusiastic
over
a
day
like
that
a
few
other
riders
had
come
up
two
or
three
officers
from
a
neighbouring
town
a
couple
of
old
men
and
a
sprinkling
of
girls
philip
hardress
was
the
only
young
man
in
plain
clothes
and
strangers
who
did
not
suspect
anything
amiss
with
his
leg
looked
at
him
curiously
look
at
that
dear
old
thing
he
whispered
to
norah
indicating
a
prim
maiden
lady
who
had
arrived
on
foot
i
know
she
aching
for
a
chance
to
ask
me
why
i
not
in
khaki
he
grinned
delightedly
she
rather
like
the
old
lady
who
met
me
in
the
train
the
other
day
and
after
looking
at
me
sadly
for
a
few
minutes
said
dear
young
man
do
you
not
know
that
your
king
and
country
want
you
phil
what
did
you
say
i
said
they
got
one
of
my
legs
and
they
do
seem
to
have
any
use
for
the
remnant
i
do
think
she
believed
me
so
i
invited
her
to
prod
it
he
chuckled
at
his
grim
joke
three
months
ago
he
had
shrunk
from
any
mention
of
his
injury
as
from
the
lash
of
a
whip
ainslie
never
wasted
time
two
minutes
grace
for
any
laggards
which
gave
time
for
the
arrival
of
a
stout
lady
on
a
cob
and
then
she
moved
on
and
in
a
moment
the
hounds
were
among
the
osiers
hidden
except
that
now
and
then
a
waving
stern
caught
the
eye
occasionally
there
was
a
brief
whimper
and
once
a
young
hound
gave
tongue
too
soon
and
was
presumably
rebuked
by
his
mother
and
relapsed
into
hunting
in
shamed
silence
the
osiers
proved
blank
they
drew
out
and
went
up
the
hill
into
the
covert
while
the
field
moved
along
to
be
as
close
as
possible
and
the
followers
on
foot
dodged
about
feverishly
hoping
for
luck
that
would
make
a
fox
break
their
way
too
often
the
weary
lot
of
the
foot
contingent
is
to
see
nothing
whatever
after
the
hounds
once
enter
covert
since
the
fox
is
apt
to
leave
it
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
at
the
far
side
and
to
take
as
short
a
line
as
he
can
across
country
to
another
refuse
to
follow
the
hounds
on
foot
needs
a
stout
heart
and
patience
surpassing
that
of
job
but
those
on
horses
know
little
of
the
blighting
experiences
of
the
and
when
norah
went
everything
ceased
to
exist
for
her
except
the
hounds
and
the
green
fields
and
brunette
under
her
as
eager
as
she
for
the
first
note
from
the
pack
they
moved
restlessly
back
and
forth
along
the
hillside
the
black
pony
dancing
with
impatience
at
the
faintest
whimper
from
an
unseen
hound
near
them
killaloe
set
an
example
of
steadiness
but
with
watchful
eyes
and
pricked
ears
squire
brand
came
up
to
them
i
advise
you
to
get
up
near
the
far
end
of
the
covert
he
said
it
almost
a
certainty
that
he
break
away
there
and
make
a
across
to
harley
wood
i
hope
he
will
for
there
less
plough
there
than
in
the
other
direction
he
hurried
off
and
norah
permitted
brunette
to
caper
after
him
a
young
officer
on
a
big
bay
followed
their
example
come
along
he
said
to
a
companion
it
a
safe
thing
to
follow
old
brand
lead
if
you
want
to
get
away
well
where
the
covert
ended
the
hill
sloped
gently
to
undulating
fields
divided
by
fairly
stiff
hedges
with
deep
ditches
and
occasionally
by
fences
more
like
the
jumps
that
norah
knew
in
australia
the
going
was
good
and
sound
and
there
was
no
wire
that
terror
of
the
hunter
norah
had
always
hated
wire
either
plain
or
barbed
she
held
that
it
found
its
true
level
in
being
used
against
germans
somewhere
in
a
tangle
of
bracken
an
old
hound
spoke
sharply
a
little
thrill
ran
through
her
she
saw
her
father
put
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
and
pull
his
hat
more
firmly
down
on
his
forehead
while
she
held
back
brunette
who
was
dancing
wildly
then
came
another
note
and
another
and
a
burst
of
music
from
the
hounds
and
suddenly
norah
saw
a
stealthy
russet
form
with
brush
sweeping
the
ground
that
stole
from
the
covert
and
slid
down
the
slope
and
after
him
a
leaping
wave
of
brown
and
white
and
black
as
hounds
came
bounding
from
the
wood
and
flung
themselves
upon
the
scent
with
ainslie
close
behind
some
one
shouted
gone
in
a
voice
that
went
ringing
in
echoes
round
the
hillside
brunette
bucked
airily
over
the
low
fence
near
the
covert
and
killaloe
took
it
almost
in
his
stride
then
they
were
racing
side
by
side
down
the
long
slope
with
the
green
turf
like
wet
velvet
underfoot
and
the
next
hedge
seemed
rushing
to
meet
them
over
landing
lightly
in
the
next
field
before
them
only
the
master
and
whip
and
the
racing
hounds
with
burning
eyes
for
the
little
red
speck
ahead
trailing
his
brush
by
jove
norah
said
david
linton
we
in
for
a
run
norah
nodded
speech
was
beyond
her
only
all
her
being
was
singing
with
the
utter
joy
of
the
ride
beneath
her
brunette
was
spurning
the
turf
with
dainty
hooves
stretching
out
in
her
gallop
yet
gathering
herself
cleverly
at
her
fences
with
alert
pricked
ears
judging
her
distance
and
landing
with
never
a
peck
or
stumble
the
light
weight
on
the
pony
back
was
nothing
to
her
the
delicate
touch
on
her
mouth
was
all
she
needed
to
steady
her
at
the
jumps
near
harley
wood
the
fox
decided
regretfully
that
safety
lay
elsewhere
the
enemy
running
silently
and
surely
were
too
hot
on
his
track
he
crept
through
a
hedge
and
slipped
like
a
shadow
down
a
ditch
and
hounds
jumping
out
were
at
fault
for
a
moment
the
slight
check
gave
the
rest
of
the
field
time
to
get
up
that
a
great
pony
norah
heard
the
young
officer
say
she
patted
brunette
arching
neck
then
a
quick
cast
of
the
hounds
picked
up
the
scent
and
again
they
were
off
but
no
longer
with
the
fences
to
themselves
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
watchful
for
the
cheerful
enthusiast
who
jumps
on
top
of
you
and
the
prudent
sportsman
who
wobbles
all
over
the
field
in
his
gallop
seeking
for
a
gap
killaloe
drew
away
again
there
was
no
hunter
in
the
country
side
to
touch
him
after
him
went
brunette
with
no
notion
of
permitting
her
stable
companion
to
lose
her
in
a
run
like
this
a
tall
hedge
faced
them
with
an
awkward
from
the
bank
of
a
ditch
killaloe
crashed
through
brunette
came
like
a
bird
in
his
tracks
norah
arm
across
her
face
to
ward
off
the
loose
branches
she
got
through
with
a
tear
in
her
coat
landing
on
stiff
plough
through
which
ainslie
grey
was
struggling
painfully
brunette
light
burden
was
all
in
her
favour
here
norah
was
first
to
the
gate
on
the
far
side
opening
it
just
in
time
for
the
master
and
thrilling
with
joy
at
that
magnate
brief
thank
you
as
she
passed
through
and
galloped
away
the
plough
had
given
the
hounds
a
long
lead
but
ahead
were
only
green
fields
dotted
by
clumps
of
trees
racing
ground
firm
and
springy
the
air
sang
in
their
ears
the
fences
seemed
as
nothing
the
good
horses
took
them
in
racing
style
landing
with
no
shock
and
galloping
on
needing
no
touch
of
whip
or
spur
the
old
was
tiring
as
well
he
might
and
yet
ahead
he
knew
lay
sanctuary
in
an
old
quarry
where
the
piled
rocks
hid
a
hole
where
he
had
lain
before
with
angry
hounds
snuffing
helplessly
around
him
he
braced
his
weary
limbs
for
a
last
effort
the
cruel
eyes
and
lolling
tongues
were
very
close
behind
him
but
his
muscles
were
steel
and
he
knew
how
to
save
every
short
cut
that
gave
him
so
much
as
a
yard
he
saw
the
quarry
just
ahead
and
snarled
his
triumph
in
his
untamed
heart
brunette
gallop
was
faltering
a
little
and
norah
heart
sank
she
had
never
had
such
a
run
it
was
hard
if
she
could
not
see
it
out
when
they
had
led
the
field
the
whole
way
and
while
yet
killaloe
was
going
like
a
in
front
then
she
heard
a
shout
from
her
father
and
saw
him
point
ahead
water
came
to
her
she
saw
the
gleam
of
water
fringed
by
reeds
saw
killaloe
rise
like
a
deer
at
it
taking
off
well
on
the
near
side
and
landing
with
many
feet
to
spare
oh
we
can
do
that
norah
thought
brunette
likes
water
she
touched
the
pony
with
her
heel
for
the
first
time
and
spoke
to
her
brunette
responded
instantly
gathering
herself
for
the
jump
again
norah
heard
a
shout
and
was
conscious
of
the
feeling
of
vague
irritation
that
we
all
know
when
some
one
is
trying
to
tell
us
something
we
can
not
possibly
hear
she
took
the
pony
at
the
jump
about
twenty
yards
from
the
place
where
killaloe
had
flown
it
nearer
and
nearer
the
water
gleamed
before
her
very
close
she
felt
the
pony
steady
herself
for
the
leap
then
the
bank
gave
way
under
her
heels
there
was
a
moment
struggle
and
a
stupendous
splash
norah
first
thought
was
that
the
water
was
extremely
cold
then
that
the
weight
on
her
left
leg
was
quite
uncomfortable
brunette
in
the
stream
too
bewildered
to
move
then
she
sank
a
little
more
to
one
side
and
norah
had
to
grip
her
mane
to
keep
herself
from
going
under
the
surface
it
seemed
an
unpleasantly
long
time
before
she
saw
her
father
face
norah
are
you
hurt
no
i
not
hurt
she
said
but
i
ca
get
my
leg
out
and
brunette
seems
to
think
she
wants
to
stay
here
i
suppose
she
finds
the
mud
nice
and
soft
she
tried
to
smile
at
his
anxious
face
but
found
it
not
altogether
easy
we
get
you
out
said
david
linton
he
tugged
at
the
bridle
and
ainslie
arriving
presently
came
to
his
assistance
while
some
of
the
other
riders
coming
up
behind
encouraged
brunette
with
shouts
and
thus
urged
brunette
decided
that
some
further
effort
was
necessary
and
made
one
with
a
mighty
flounder
while
norah
rolled
off
into
the
water
half
a
dozen
hands
helped
her
at
the
bank
you
sure
you
not
hurt
her
father
asked
anxiously
i
was
horribly
afraid
she
roll
on
your
leg
when
she
moved
i
quite
all
right
only
disgustingly
wet
said
norah
oh
and
i
missed
the
finish
did
you
ever
know
such
bad
luck
well
you
only
missed
the
last
fifty
yards
said
ainslie
pointing
to
the
quarry
from
which
the
whips
were
dislodging
the
aggrieved
hounds
we
finished
there
and
that
old
fox
is
good
for
another
day
yet
i
give
you
the
brush
if
he
had
decided
to
keep
it
himself
oh
said
norah
blushing
while
her
teeth
chattered
was
it
a
beautiful
run
it
was
but
something
has
got
to
be
done
with
you
said
ainslie
firmly
there
a
farmhouse
over
there
linton
i
know
the
people
and
they
do
anything
they
can
for
you
hurry
her
over
and
get
her
wet
things
off
hardy
will
lend
her
some
clothes
and
norah
made
a
draggled
and
inglorious
exit
hardy
received
her
with
horrified
exclamations
and
offers
of
all
that
she
had
in
the
house
so
that
presently
norah
found
herself
drinking
cup
after
cup
of
very
hot
tea
and
eating
buttered
toast
with
her
father
attired
in
a
plaid
blouse
of
green
and
red
in
large
checks
and
a
black
velvet
skirt
that
had
seen
better
days
with
carpet
slippers
lending
a
neat
finish
to
a
somewhat
striking
appearance
without
farm
hands
rubbed
down
killaloe
and
brunette
in
the
stable
hardy
fluttered
in
and
out
bringing
more
and
yet
more
toast
until
her
guests
protested
vehemently
that
exhausted
nature
forbade
them
to
eat
another
crumb
and
wot
is
toast
grumbled
hardy
and
you
ridin
all
day
in
the
cold
she
had
been
grievously
disappointed
at
her
refusing
bacon
and
eggs
the
young
lady
catch
death
fate
just
another
cup
miss
lor
who
that
comin
in
at
the
gate
that
proved
to
be
squire
brand
who
had
appeared
at
the
scene
of
norah
disaster
just
after
her
retreat
being
accused
by
ainslie
of
employing
an
aeroplane
i
came
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
use
he
said
his
eye
fell
on
norah
in
hardy
clothes
and
he
said
dear
me
suddenly
and
for
a
moment
lost
the
thread
of
his
remarks
you
ca
let
her
ride
home
linton
my
car
is
here
and
if
your
daughter
will
let
me
drive
her
home
i
sure
hardy
will
house
her
pony
until
you
can
send
a
groom
over
for
it
i
a
spare
coat
in
the
car
yes
thank
you
hardy
i
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
very
much
now
that
the
excitement
of
the
day
was
over
norah
was
beginning
to
feel
tired
enough
to
be
glad
to
escape
the
long
ride
home
on
a
jaded
horse
so
with
hardy
raiment
hidden
beneath
a
gorgeous
fur
coat
she
was
presently
in
the
squire
car
slipping
through
the
dusk
of
the
lonely
country
lanes
the
squire
liked
jim
and
asked
questions
about
him
and
to
talk
of
jim
was
always
the
nearest
way
to
norah
heart
she
had
exhausted
his
present
and
was
as
far
back
in
his
past
as
his
triumphs
in
cricket
when
they
turned
in
at
the
homewood
avenue
i
afraid
i
talked
an
awful
lot
she
said
blushing
you
see
jim
and
i
are
tremendous
chums
i
often
think
how
lucky
i
was
to
have
a
brother
like
him
as
i
had
only
one
possibly
jim
thinks
the
same
about
his
sister
said
the
old
man
he
looked
at
her
kindly
there
was
something
very
in
the
small
face
in
the
great
fur
collar
of
his
coat
at
all
events
jim
has
a
good
champion
he
said
oh
jim
does
need
a
champion
norah
answered
every
one
likes
him
i
think
and
of
course
we
think
there
no
one
like
him
the
motor
stopped
and
the
squire
helped
her
out
it
was
too
late
to
come
in
he
said
he
bade
her
good
night
and
went
back
to
the
car
norah
looked
in
the
glass
in
the
hall
and
decided
that
her
appearance
was
too
striking
to
be
kept
to
herself
a
very
battered
felt
surmounted
hardy
finery
it
bore
numerous
some
of
which
had
extended
to
her
face
no
one
was
in
the
hall
it
was
late
and
presumably
the
tired
people
were
dressing
for
dinner
she
headed
for
the
kitchen
meeting
on
the
way
allenby
who
uttered
a
choking
sound
and
dived
into
his
pantry
norah
chuckled
and
passed
on
miss
de
lisle
sat
near
the
range
knitting
her
muffler
she
looked
up
and
caught
her
breath
at
the
apparition
that
danced
in
norah
more
like
a
scarecrow
than
anything
else
with
her
grey
eyes
bright
among
the
she
held
up
velvet
skirt
in
each
hand
and
danced
solemnly
up
the
long
kitchen
pointing
each
foot
daintily
in
the
gaudy
carpet
slippers
oh
my
goodness
ejaculated
miss
de
lisle
and
broke
into
helpless
laughter
norah
sat
down
by
the
fender
and
told
the
story
of
her
day
with
a
cheerful
interlude
when
katty
came
in
hurriedly
failed
to
see
her
until
close
upon
her
and
then
collapsed
miss
de
lisle
listened
twinkling
well
you
must
go
and
dress
she
said
at
length
it
would
be
only
kind
to
every
one
if
you
came
down
to
dinner
like
that
but
i
suppose
it
would
do
it
would
be
dignified
said
norah
looking
at
the
moment
as
though
dignity
were
the
last
thing
she
cared
about
well
i
suppose
i
must
go
she
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
danced
out
again
pausing
at
the
door
to
execute
a
high
kick
then
she
curtsied
demurely
to
the
laughing
and
fled
to
her
room
by
a
back
staircase
she
came
down
a
while
later
tubbed
and
refreshed
in
a
dainty
blue
frock
with
a
black
ribbon
in
her
shining
curls
the
laughter
had
not
yet
died
out
of
her
eyes
she
was
humming
one
of
jim
school
songs
as
she
crossed
the
hall
allenby
was
just
turning
from
the
door
a
telegram
miss
norah
thanks
allenby
she
took
it
still
smiling
i
hope
it
is
to
say
any
one
is
coming
she
said
as
she
carried
it
to
the
light
would
it
be
lovely
if
it
was
to
tell
us
they
had
leave
there
was
no
need
to
specify
whom
they
meant
but
i
afraid
that
too
much
to
hope
just
yet
she
tore
open
the
envelope
there
was
a
long
silence
as
she
stood
there
with
the
paper
in
her
hand
a
silence
that
grew
gradually
more
terrible
while
her
face
turned
white
over
and
over
she
read
the
scrawled
words
as
if
in
the
vain
hope
that
the
thing
they
told
might
yet
prove
only
a
hideous
dream
from
which
presently
she
might
wake
then
as
if
very
far
away
she
heard
the
butler
shaking
voice
miss
norah
is
it
bad
news
you
can
send
the
boy
away
she
heard
herself
say
as
though
it
were
some
other
person
speaking
there
is
any
answer
he
has
been
killed
not
mr
jim
allenby
voice
was
a
wail
yes
she
turned
from
him
and
walked
into
the
shutting
the
door
in
the
grate
a
fire
was
burning
the
leaping
light
fell
on
jim
photograph
standing
on
a
table
near
she
stared
at
it
still
holding
the
telegram
surely
it
was
a
dream
she
had
so
often
had
it
before
surely
she
would
soon
wake
and
laugh
at
herself
the
door
was
flung
open
and
her
father
came
in
ruddy
and
splashed
she
remembered
afterwards
the
shape
of
a
on
his
sleeve
it
seemed
to
be
curiously
important
norah
what
is
wrong
she
put
out
her
hands
to
him
then
shaking
jim
had
said
it
was
her
job
to
look
after
him
but
she
could
not
help
him
now
and
no
words
would
come
is
it
jim
at
the
agony
of
his
voice
she
gave
a
little
choking
cry
catching
at
him
blindly
the
telegram
fluttered
to
the
floor
and
david
linton
picked
it
up
and
read
it
he
laid
the
paper
on
the
table
and
turned
to
her
holding
out
his
hands
silently
and
she
came
to
him
and
put
her
face
on
his
breast
trembling
his
arm
tightened
round
her
so
they
stood
while
the
time
dragged
on
he
put
her
into
a
chair
at
last
and
they
looked
at
each
other
they
had
said
no
word
since
that
first
moment
well
said
david
linton
slowly
we
knew
it
might
come
and
we
know
that
he
died
like
a
man
and
that
he
never
shirked
thank
god
we
had
him
norah
and
thank
god
my
son
died
a
soldier
not
a
slacker
chapter
xiv
carrying
on
after
that
first
terrible
evening
during
which
no
one
had
looked
upon
their
agony
david
linton
and
his
child
took
up
their
life
again
and
tried
to
splice
the
broken
ends
as
best
they
might
their
guests
who
came
down
to
breakfast
nervously
preparing
to
go
away
at
once
found
them
in
the
haggard
and
worn
but
pleasantly
courteous
they
talked
of
the
morning
news
of
the
frost
that
seemed
commencing
of
the
bulbs
that
were
sending
delicate
up
through
the
grass
or
the
bare
there
were
arrangements
for
the
day
to
be
made
for
those
who
cared
to
ride
or
drive
the
trains
to
be
planned
for
a
gunner
subaltern
whose
leave
was
expiring
next
day
everything
was
quite
as
usual
outwardly
pretty
ghastly
meal
what
remarked
the
young
gunner
to
a
chum
as
they
went
out
on
the
terrace
rather
like
dancing
at
a
funeral
philip
hardress
came
into
the
where
linton
and
norah
were
talking
i

hands
in
front
of
us
we
mean
to
work
a
bit
harder
all
you
see
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flickered
across
the
face
that
had
aged
ten
years
in
a
night
more
than
ever
now
whatever
we
do
for
a
soldier

kind
arms

no
tears
i
suppose
we
have

to
think
of
him

that
her
face
changed
oh

girl

a
son

to
draw
him

she
put
her
arms
round
the
little
boy
and
suddenly
her
head
went
down
on
his
shoulder
the
tears
came
at
last
hunt
went
softly
from
the
room
there
were
plenty
of
tears
in
the
household
the
servants
had
all
loved
the
big
cheery
lad
with
the
pleasant
word
for
each
one
they
went
about
their
work
and
allenby
chafed
openly
at
the
age
that
kept
him
at
home
doing
a
woman
work
while
boys
went
out
to
give
their
lives
laughing
for
empire
it
ai
fair
he
said
to
miss
de
lisle
who
sobbed
into
the
muffler
she
was
knitting
it
ai
fair
kids
they
are
no
more
they
ai
meant
to
die
oh

could
only
get
at
that
there
kayser
then
after
a
week
of
waiting
came
wally
letter
norah
dear
i
do
know
how
to
write
to
you
i
ca
bear
to
think
about
you
and
your
father
it
seems
it
must
be
only
a
bad
dream
and
all
the
time
i
know
it
is
even
though
i
keep
thinking
i
hear
his
whistle
the
one
he
used
for
me
i
had
better
tell
you
about
it
we
had
orders
to
attack
early
one
morning
jim
was
awfully
keen
he
had
everything
ready
and
he
had
been
talking
to
the
men
until
they
were
all
as
bucked
up
as
they
could
be
you
know
he
was
often
pretty
grave
about
his
work
but
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
him
look
so
happy
as
he
did
that
morning
he
looked
just
like
a
kid
he
told
me
he
felt
as
if
he
were
going
out
on
a
good
horse
at
billabong
we
were
looking
over
our
revolvers
and
he
said
the
only
thing
that
feels
wrong
it
ought
to
be
a
stock
whip
we
had
much
artillery
support
our
guns
were
short
of
shells
as
usual
but
we
took
the
first
trench
and
the
next
jim
was
just
everywhere
he
was
always
first
the
men
would
have
followed
him
down
a
precipice
he
was
laughing
all
the
time
we
did
get
much
time
before
they
they
came
on
in
waves
as
if
there
were
millions
of
them
and
we
had
a
pretty
stiff
fight
in
the
trench
it
was
fairly
well
smashed
about
i
was
pretty
busy
about
fifty
yards
away
but
i
saw
jim
up
on
a
broken
traverse
using
his
revolver
just
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
practising
in
camp
and
cheering
on
the
men
he
gave
me
a
and
then
oh
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
just
as
i
was
looking
at
him
a
shell
burst
near
him
and
when
the
smoke
blew
over
there
was
nothing
traverse
and
trench
and
all
it
was
just
wiped
out
i
could
get
near
him
the
boches
were
pouring
over
in
fresh
masses
and
we
got
the
signal
to
retire
and
i
was
the
only
one
left
to
get
the
men
back
he
could
have
felt
anything
that
the
only
thing
i
wish
it
had
been
me
i
nobody
dog
and
he
was
just
everything
to
you
two
and
the
best
friend
a
fellow
ever
had
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
reasonable
if
it
had
been
me
i
just
feel
that
i
hate
myself
for
being
alive
i
would
have
saved
him
for
you
if
i
could
norah
wally
there
were
letters
too
from
jim
colonel
and
from
major
hunt
and
garrett
and
every
other
whom
jim
had
sent
to
homewood
and
others
that
norah
and
her
father
valued
almost
more
highly
from
men
who
had
served
under
him
letters
that
made
him
glow
with
pride
almost
forgetting
grief
as
they
read
them
it
seemed
so
impossible
to
think
that
jim
would
never
come
again
i
ca
feel
as
though
he
were
dead
norah
said
looking
up
at
her
father
i
know
i
got
to
get
used
to
knowing
he
has
gone
away
from
us
for
always
but
i
like
to
think
of
him
as
having
only
changed
work
jim
never
could
be
idle
in
heaven
he
always
used
to
say
it
seemed
such
a
queer
idea
to
sit
all
day
in
a
white
robe
and
play
a
harp
jim
heaven
would
have
to
be
a
very
busy
one
and
i
know
gone
there
dad
david
linton
got
up
and
went
to
the
bookcase
he
came
back
with
ho
in
his
hand
i
was
reading
kingsley
idea
of
it
last
night
he
said
i
think
it
helps
norah
listen
best
reward
for
having
wrought
well
already
is
to
have
more
to
do
and
he
that
has
been
faithful
over
a
few
things
must
find
his
account
in
being
made
ruler
over
many
things
that
is
the
true
and
heroical
rest
which
only
is
worthy
of
gentlemen
and
sons
of
god
jim
was
only
a
boy
but
he
went
straight
and
did
his
best
all
his
life
i
think
he
has
just
been
promoted
to
some
bigger
job
so
they
held
their
heads
high
as
befitted
people
with
just
cause
for
being
proud
and
set
themselves
to
find
the
rest
that
comes
from
hard
work
there
was
plenty
to
do
for
the
house
was
always
full
of
tired
people
not
that
the
lintons
ever
tried
to
entertain
their
guests
tired
people
came
to
a
big
quiet
house
where
everything
ran
smoothly
and
all
that
was
possible
was
done
for
comfort
beyond
that
they
did
exactly
as
they
chose
there
were
horses
and
the
motor
for
those
who
cared
to
ride
and
drive
the
links
for
golfers
walks
with
beautiful
scenery
for
energetic
folk
and
dainty
rooms
with
big
or
restful
lounges
under
the
trees
on
the
lawn
for
those
who
asked
from
fate
nothing
better
than
to
be
lazy
no
one
was
expected
to
make
conversation
or
to
behave
as
an
ordinary
guest
everywhere
there
was
a
pleasant
feeling
of
homeliness
and
welcome
shy
men
became
suddenly
at
their
ease
men
strained
with
long
months
of
the
noise
and
horror
of
war
relaxed
in
the
peace
of
homewood
and
went
back
to
duty
with
a
light
step
and
a
clear
eye
only
there
was
missing
the
wild
merriment
of
the
first
few
weeks
when
jim
and
wally
dashed
in
and
out
perpetually
and
kept
the
house
in
a
simmer
of
uncertainty
and
laughter
that
could
never
come
again
but
beyond
the
immediate
needs
of
the
tired
people
there
was
much
to
plan
and
carry
out
conscription
in
england
was
an
established
fact
already
there
were
few
fit
men
to
be
seen
out
of
uniform
david
linton
looked
forward
to
a
time
when
shortage
of
labour
coupled
with
the
deadly
work
of
the
german
submarines
should
mean
a
shortage
of
food
and
he
and
norah
set
themselves
to
provide
against
that
time
of
scarcity
miss
de
lisle
and
philip
hardress
entered
into
every
plan
lending
the
help
of
brains
as
well
as
hands
the
farm
was
put
under
intensive
culture
and
the
first
provision
made
for
the
future
was
that
of
fertilizers
which
since
most
of
them
came
from
abroad
were
certain
to
be
scarce
linton
and
hardress
breathed
more
freely
when
they
had
stored
a
two
years
supply
the
flock
of
sheep
was
increased
the
doubled
in
size
and
put
in
charge
of
a
disabled
soldier
a
australian
whom
hardress
found
in
london
ill
and
miserable
and
added
to
the
list
of
patients
and
cures
young
heifers
were
bought
and
at
neighbouring
farms
a
populous
community
of
grunting
pigs
occupied
a
little
field
and
in
the
house
norah
and
miss
de
lisle
worked
through
the
spring
and
summer
until
the
dry
and
spacious
cellars
and
storerooms
showed
row
upon
row
of
shelves
covered
with
everything
that
could
be
preserved
or
salted
or
pickled
from
eggs
to
runner
beans
sometimes
the
tired
people
lent
a
hand
becoming
interested
in
their
hosts
schemes
norah
formed
a
fast
friendship
with
a
cheerful
subaltern
in
the
irish
guards
who
was
with
them
for
a
wet
fortnight
much
of
which
he
spent
in
the
kitchen
stoning
fruit
making
jam
and
acting
as
to
the
finished
product
there
were
many
who
asked
nothing
better
than
to
work
on
the
farm
digging
planting
or
harvesting
indeed
in
the
summer
one
crop
would
have
been
ruined
altogether
by
a
fierce
storm
but
for
the
tired
people
who
from
an
elderly
colonel
to
an
australian
signaller
flung
themselves
upon
it
and
helped
to
finish
getting
it
under
cover
carrying
the
last
sheaves
home
just
as
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
returning
to
homewood
in
a
soaked
but
triumphant
procession
indeed
nearly
all
the
unending
stream
of
guests
came
under
the
spell
of
the
place
so
that
norah
used
to
receive
anxious
inquiries
from
various
corners
of
the
earth
afterwards
from
egypt
or
salonica
would
come
demands
as
to
the
success
of
a
which
the
writer
had
helped
to
sow
or
of
a
brood
of
buff
orpingtons
which
he
had
watched
hatching
out
in
the
incubator
even
from
german
east
africa
came
a
letter
asking
after
a
special
litter
of
pigs
perhaps
it
was
that
every
one
knew
that
the
lintons
were
shouldering
a
burden
bravely
and
tried
to
help
they
kept
jim
very
close
to
them
a
stranger
hearing
the
name
so
often
on
their
lips
might
have
thought
that
he
was
still
with
them
together
they
talked
of
him
always
not
sadly
but
remembering
the
long
happy
years
that
now
meant
a
memory
too
dear
ever
to
let
go
jim
had
once
asked
norah
for
a
promise
if
i
go
west
he
said
do
wear
any
horrible
black
frocks
so
she
went
about
in
her
ordinary
dresses
especially
the
blue
frocks
he
had
loved
with
just
a
narrow
black
band
on
her
arm
there
were
fresh
flowers
under
his
picture
every
day
but
she
did
not
put
them
sadly
she
would
smile
at
the
frank
happy
face
as
she
arranged
leaves
and
blossoms
with
a
loving
hand
later
on
david
linton
fitted
up
a
carpenter
bench
and
a
workshop
the
days
were
too
full
for
much
thinking
but
he
found
the
evenings
long
he
enlisted
hardress
in
his
old
work
of
and
then
found
that
half
his
guests
used
to
stray
out
to
the
lit
workshop
after
dinner
and
beg
for
jobs
so
that
before
long
the
nearest
hospital
supply
depot
could
count
on
a
steady
output
of
work
from
homewood
hunt
and
norah
used
to
come
as
polishers
miss
de
lisle
suddenly
discovered
that
her
soul
for
cooking
included
a
corner
for
carpentry
and
became
extraordinarily
skilful
in
the
use
of
chisel
and
plane
when
the
autumn
days
brought
a
chill
into
the
air
linton
put
a
stove
into
the
workshop
and
it
became
a
kind
of
club
where
the
whole
household
might
often
be
found
they
extended
their
activities
to
the
manufacture
of
crutches
and
half
a
dozen
other
aids
to
comfort
for
broken
men
no
work
had
helped
david
linton
so
much
in
the
early
summer
wally
came
back
on
leave
a
changed
wally
with
grim
lines
where
there
had
once
been
only
merry
ones
in
his
lean
brown
face
he
did
not
want
to
come
to
homewood
only
when
begged
to
come
did
he
master
the
pitiful
shrinking
he
felt
from
meeting
them
i
did
know
how
to
face
you
he
said
norah
had
gone
to
meet
him
and
they
were
walking
back
from
the
station
do
wally
you
hurt
she
said
it
true
though
i
did
i
feel
as
if
you
must
hate
me
for
coming
back
alone
hate
you
and
you
were
jim
chum
i
always
came
as
jim
chum
wally
said
heavily
from
the
very
first
when
i
was
a
lonely
little
nipper
at
school
i
sort
of
belonged
to
jim
and
now
well
i
just
ca
realize
it
norah
i
ca
keep
on
thinking
about
him
as
dead
i
know
he
is
and
one
minute
feeling
about
it
and
the
next
i
forget
and
think
i
hear
him
whistling
or
calling
me
he
clenched
his
hands
it
the
minute
after
that
that
is
the
worst
of
all
he
said
for
a
time
they
did
not
speak
they
walked
on
slowly
along
the
pleasant
country
lane
with
its
blossoming
hedges
i
know
norah
said
there
not
much
to
choose
between
you
and
dad
and
me
when
it
comes
to
missing
jim
but
as
for
you
well
you
did
come
as
jim
chum
first
and
always
but
you
came
just
as
much
because
you
were
yourself
you
know
you
belonged
to
billabong
as
we
all
did
you
ca
cut
yourself
off
from
us
now
wally
i
he
echoed
well
if
i
do
i
have
mighty
little
left
but
i
felt
that
you
could
want
to
see
me
i
know
what
it
must
be
like
to
see
me
come
back
without
him
i
not
going
to
say
it
does
hurt
said
norah
only
it
hurts
you
as
much
as
it
does
us
and
the
thing
that
would
be
ever
so
much
worse
is
for
you
not
to
come
why
you
the
only
comfort
we
have
left
do
you
see
you
like
a
bit
of
jim
coming
back
to
us
oh
norah
norah
he
said
if
i
could
only
have
saved
him
do
we
know
you
have
died
quite
happily
if
you
could
norah
said
just
as
happily
as
he
would
have
died
for
you
he
did
you
know
wally
said
all
the
youth
and
joy
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
leaving
it
flat
and
toneless
two
or
three
times
that
morning
he
kept
me
out
of
a
specially
hot
spot
and
took
it
himself
he
was
always
doing
it
we
nearly
punched
each
other
heads
about
it
the
day
before
i
told
him
he
was
using
his
rank
unfairly
he
just
grinned
and
said
subalterns
could
understand
necessary
strategy
in
the
field
he
would
said
norah
laughing
wally
stared
at
her
i
did
think
i
ever
see
you
laugh
again
not
laugh
norah
echoed
why
it
would
be
fair
to
jim
if
we
did
we
keep
him
as
near
us
as
we
can
talk
about
him
and
about
all
the
old
happy
times
we
did
have
such
awfully
good
times
together
did
we
we
never
going
to
get
far
away
from
him
the
boy
gave
a
great
sigh
i
been
getting
a
long
way
from
everything
he
said
since
since
it
happened
i
could
let
myself
think
it
was
just
as
if
i
were
going
mad
the
only
thing
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
fight
and
i
had
that
he
looks
as
if
his
mind
were
more
tired
than
his
body
david
linton
said
that
evening
one
can
see
that
he
has
just
been
torturing
himself
with
all
sorts
of
useless
thoughts
you
have
to
take
him
in
hand
norah
put
the
other
work
aside
for
a
while
and
go
out
with
him
ride
as
much
as
you
can
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
either
we
never
thought
old
wally
would
be
one
of
the
tired
people
norah
said
musingly
no
indeed
and
i
think
there
has
been
no
one
more
utterly
tired
it
wo
do
norah
the
boy
will
be
ill
if
we
do
look
after
him
we
just
got
to
make
him
feel
how
much
we
want
him
norah
said
yes
and
we
have
to
teach
him
to
think
happily
about
jim
not
to
fight
it
all
the
time
fighting
wo
make
it
any
better
said
david
linton
with
a
sigh
but
there
was
no
riding
for
wally
for
a
while
the
next
day
found
him
too
ill
to
get
up
and
the
doctor
sent
for
hastily
talked
of
shock
and
and
ordered
bed
until
his
temperature
should
be
pleased
to
go
down
which
was
not
for
many
a
weary
day
possibly
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
wally
he
grew
if
not
reconciled
at
least
accustomed
to
his
loss
grew
too
to
thinking
himself
a
coward
when
he
saw
the
daily
struggle
waged
by
the
two
people
he
loved
best
and
norah
was
wise
enough
to
call
in
other
nurses
chief
of
them
the
hunt
babies
alison
and
michael
who
rolled
on
his
bed
and
played
with
him
while
geoffrey
sat
as
close
to
him
as
possible
and
could
hardly
be
lured
from
the
room
it
was
not
for
weeks
after
his
return
that
they
heard
wally
laugh
and
then
it
was
at
some
ridiculous
speech
of
michael
that
he
suddenly
broke
into
the
ghost
of
his
old
mirth
norah
heart
gave
a
leap
oh
he
better
she
thought
you
blessed
little
michael
and
so
healing
came
to
the
boy
bruised
soul
not
that
the
old
wally
came
back
but
he
learned
to
talk
of
jim
and
no
longer
to
hug
his
sorrow
in
silence
something
became
his
of
the
peace
that
had
fallen
upon
norah
and
her
father
it
was
all
they
could
hope
for
to
begin
with
they
said
to
him
before
they
considered
him
well
enough
to
go
back
to
the
trenches
but
the
call
for
men
was
insistent
and
the
boy
himself
was
eager
to
go
come
back
to
us
soon
norah
said
wistfully
oh
i
safe
to
come
back
wally
said
i
nobody
dog
you
know
that
not
fair
she
flashed
say
you
sorry
for
saying
it
he
flushed
i
sorry
if
i
hurt
you
nor
i
suppose
i
was
a
brute
to
say
that
something
of
his
old
quaint
fun
came
into
his
eyes
for
a
moment
anyhow
it
something
to
be
somebody
dog
especially
if
one
happens
to
belong
to
chapter
xv
prisoners
and
captives
the
church
was
half
in
ruins
great
portions
of
the
roof
had
been
torn
away
by
and
there
were
gaping
holes
in
the
walls
through
which
could
be
caught
glimpses
of
sentries
going
backwards
and
forwards
sometimes
a
grey
battalion
swung
by
sometimes
a
german
officer
peered
in
curiously
with
a
sneer
on
his
lips
the
drone
of
aircraft
came
from
above
through
the
holes
where
the
rafters
showed
black
against
the
sky
ever
the
guns
boomed
savagely
from
beyond
there
were
no
longer
any
seats
in
the
church
they
had
all
been
broken
up
for
even
the
oaken
pulpit
had
gone
the
great
empty
space
had
been
roughly
cleared
of
fallen
masonry
which
had
been
flung
in
heaps
against
the
wall
on
the
stone
floor
filthy
straw
was
thinly
spread
on
the
straw
lay
row
upon
row
of
wounded
men
very
quiet
for
the
most
part
they
had
found
that
it
did
not
pay
to
make
noise
enough
to
annoy
the
guards
who
smoked
and
played
cards
in
a
corner
the
long
day
how
long
only
the
men
on
the
straw
knew
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
sun
sank
behind
the
western
window
which
the
guns
had
spared
and
the
stained
glass
turned
to
a
glory
of
scarlet
and
gold
and
blue
the
shafts
of
colour
lay
across
the
broken
altar
whence
everything
had
been
stripped
they
bathed
the
shattered
walls
in
a
beauty
that
was
like
a
cloak
over
the
nakedness
of
their
ruin
slowly
they
crept
over
the
floor
as
the
sun
sank
lower
touching
the
straw
with
rosy
fingers
falling
gently
on
broken
bodies
and
faces
and
weary
eyes
looked
gratefully
up
to
the
window
where
a
figure
of
christ
with
a
child
in
his
arms
stood
glorious
in
the
light
and
blessed
them
with
the
infinite
pity
of
his
smile
a
little
cockney
lad
with
a
dirty
bandage
round
his
head
who
had
tossed
in
pain
all
day
on
the
chancel
steps
turned
to
the
window
to
greet
the
daily
miracle
of
the
sunset
worf
waiting
for
all
the
day
that
is
he
muttered
the
restlessness
left
him
and
his
eyes
closed
presently
in
sleep
slowly
the
glory
died
away
and
as
it
passed
a
little
figure
in
a
rusty
black
cassock
came
in
making
his
way
among
the
men
on
the
straw
it
was
the
french
priest
who
had
refused
to
leave
his
broken
church
a
little
fat
man
not
in
the
least
like
a
hero
but
with
as
knightly
a
soul
as
was
ever
found
in
armour
and
with
lance
in
rest
he
passed
from
man
to
man
speaking
in
quaint
english
occasionally
dropping
gladly
into
french
when
he
found
some
one
able
to
answer
him
in
his
own
language
he
had
nothing
to
give
them
but
water
but
that
he
carried
tirelessly
many
times
a
day
his
little
store
of
bandages
and
ointment
had
gone
long
ago
but
he
bathed
wounds
helped
cramped
men
to
change
their
position
and
did
the
best
he
could
to
make
the
evil
straw
into
the
semblance
of
a
comfortable
bed
to
the
helpless
men
on
the
floor
of
the
church
his
coming
meant
something
akin
to
paradise
he
paused
near
a
little
irishman
with
a
broken
leg
a
man
of
the
dublin
fusiliers
whose
pain
had
not
been
able
to
destroy
his
good
temper
how
are
you
garcon
yerra
not
too
bad
father
said
the
irishman
if
i
could
have
just
a
taste
of
water
now
he
drank
deeply
as
the
priest
lifted
his
head
and
sank
back
with
a
word
of
thanks
this
feather
pillow
of
mine
is
apt
to
slip
if
i
do
watch
it
he
said
wriggling
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
cold
stone
of
the
floor
from
which
the
straw
had
worked
away
i
dunno
could
you
gather
it
up
a
bit
father
he
grinned
i
ask
you
to
put
me
boots
under
me
for
a
pillow
but
if
them
thieving
guards
found
them
loose
they
shweep
them
from
me
my
son
the
priest
whispered
warningly
he
shook
up
a
handful
of
straw
and
made
it
as
firm
as
he
could
under
the
man
head
it
is
not
prudent
to
speak
so
loud
remember
you
can
not
see
who
may
be
behind
you
indeed
and
i
can
not
returned
denny
callaghan
i
remember
father
that
great
he
settled
his
head
thankfully
on
the
straw
pillow
i
sleep
aisier
for
that
and
le
has
he
moved
yet
the
priest
glanced
at
a
motionless
form
near
them
well
indeed
he
did
father
this
afternoon
he
gev
a
turn
an
he
said
something
like
people
i
thought
there
was
great
sense
in
that
if
he
was
talkin
to
us
so
i
was
cheered
up
about
him
but
not
a
word
have
i
got
out
of
him
since
but
it
something
that
he
spoke
at
all
the
bent
over
the
quiet
figure
two
dark
eyes
opened
as
if
with
difficulty
and
met
his
norah
said
jim
linton
are
you
there
norah
i
am
a
friend
my
son
said
the
are
you
in
pain
the
dark
eyes
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
then
he
murmured
water
it
is
here
the
little
priest
held
the
heavy
head
and
jim
managed
to
drink
a
little
something
like
a
shadow
of
a
smile
came
into
his
eyes
as
the
priest
wiped
his
lips
then
they
closed
again
if
they
would
send
us
a
doctor
muttered
the
in
his
own
language
longingly
what
a
lad
he
looked
down
in
admiration
at
the
splendid
helpless
body
he
wo
die
father
will
he
i
do
not
know
my
son
i
can
find
no
wound
except
the
one
on
his
head
nothing
seems
broken
perhaps
he
will
be
better
he
gave
the
little
irishman
his
blessing
and
moved
away
there
were
many
eager
eyes
awaiting
him
jim
was
restless
during
the
night
denny
callaghan
himself
unable
to
sleep
watched
him
muttering
and
trying
to
turn
but
unable
to
move
i
doubt
but
his
back
broken
said
the
little
man
ruefully
yerra
what
a
pity
he
tried
to
soothe
the
boy
with
kind
words
and
towards
the
dawn
jim
slept
heavily
he
woke
when
the
sun
was
shining
upon
him
through
a
rift
in
the
wall
the
church
was
full
of
smothered
sounds
stifled
groans
from
helpless
men
stiffened
by
lying
still
and
trying
to
move
jim
managed
to
raise
himself
a
little
at
which
denny
callaghan
gave
an
exclamation
of
relief
hurroo
are
you
better
sir
where
am
i
jim
asked
thickly
is
in
a
church
you
are
sir
though
it
not
much
like
it
said
the
little
man
the
germans
call
it
a
hospital
is
all
i
wish
they
may
have
the
like
themselves
and
they
wounded
are
you
better
sir
i
think
i
all
right
jim
said
he
was
trying
to
regain
his
scattered
faculties
so
they
got
me
he
tried
to
look
at
callaghan
what
your
regiment
the
dubs
sir
is
hard
luck
i
kem
back
wounded
from
suvla
bay
and
they
sent
me
out
to
the
battalion
here
and
i
not
been
with
them
a
week
before
i
got
landed
again
now
is
a
german
prison
ahead
and
by
all
one
hears
they
not
no
said
jim
he
tried
to
move
but
failed
sinking
back
with
a
stifled
groan
i
wish
i
knew
if
i
was
damaged
much
are
there
any
doctors
here
there
was
two
a
while
back
they
fixed
us
up
somehow
and
we
have
seen
a
hair
of
them
since
the
guards
throw
rations
of
a
sort
at
us
twice
a
day
is
badly
off
we
be
if
it
were
for
the
priest
is
he
french
he
is
and
a
saint
if
there
ever
was
one
there
he
comes
now
callaghan
crossed
himself
reverently
a
hush
had
come
over
the
church
the
in
his
vestments
had
entered
going
slowly
to
the
altar
jim
struggled
up
on
his
elbow
there
was
perfect
silence
in
the
church
men
who
had
been
talking
ceased
suddenly
men
who
moaned
in
their
pain
bit
back
their
cries
so
they
lay
while
the
little
priest
celebrated
mass
as
he
had
done
every
morning
since
the
germans
swept
over
his
village
at
first
alone
and
since
the
first
few
days
to
a
silent
congregation
of
helpless
men
they
were
of
all
creeds
and
some
of
no
creed
at
all
but
they
prayed
after
him
as
men
learn
to
pray
when
they
are
at
grips
with
things
too
big
for
them
he
blessed
them
at
the
end
with
uplifted
hand
and
dim
eyes
followed
him
as
he
went
slowly
from
the
church
he
was
back
among
them
presently
in
the
rusty
black
cassock
the
guards
had
brought
in
the
men
breakfast
great
cans
of
soup
and
loaves
of
hard
dark
bread
they
put
them
down
near
the
door
tramping
out
with
complete
disregard
of
the
helpless
prisoners
the
priest
would
see
to
them
aided
by
the
few
prisoners
who
could
move
about
wounded
though
they
were
in
any
case
the
guard
had
no
order
to
feed
prisoners
they
were
not
they
said
ah
my
son
you
are
awake
jim
smiled
up
at
the
have
i
been
asleep
long
sir
three
days
they
brought
you
in
last
friday
night
do
you
not
remember
no
said
jim
i
do
remember
coming
here
he
drank
some
soup
eagerly
but
shook
his
head
at
the
horrible
bread
the
food
cleared
his
head
and
when
the
little
had
gone
away
promising
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
he
lay
quietly
piecing
matters
together
in
his
mind
callaghan
helped
him
the
dublins
had
been
in
the
line
next
his
own
regiment
when
they
had
gone
over
the
top
on
that
last
morning
oh
i
remember
all
that
well
enough
jim
said
we
took
two
lines
of
trench
and
then
they
came
at
us
like
a
wall
the
ground
was
grey
with
them
and
i
was
up
on
a
smashed
traverse
trying
to
keep
the
men
together
when
it
went
up
too
a
shell
was
it
jim
shook
his
head
a
shell
did
burst
near
us
but
it
was
that
no
the
trench
was
mined
and
the
mine
went
off
a
shade
too
late
they
delayed
somehow
it
should
have
gone
off
if
we
took
the
trench
before
they
as
it
was
it
must
have
killed
as
many
of
their
men
as
ours
they
told
me
about
it
afterwards
afterwards
said
callaghan
curiously
he
looked
at
jim
a
little
doubtful
as
to
whether
he
really
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
did
ye
not
come
straight
here
then
sir
i
did
not
i
was
buried
said
jim
grimly
the
old
mine
went
up
right
under
me
and
i
went
up
too
i
came
down
with
what
seemed
like
tons
of
earth
on
top
of
me
i
was
covered
right
in
i
tell
you
only
i
managed
to
get
some
of
the
earth
away
in
front
of
my
nose
and
mouth
i
was
lying
on
my
side
near
the
edge
of
a
big
heap
of
dirt
with
my
hands
near
my
face
if
i
been
six
inches
further
back
there
would
have
been
the
ghost
of
a
chance
for
me
i
got
some
of
the
earth
and
mud
away
and
found
i
could
breathe
just
as
i
was
choking
but
i
was
buried
for
all
that
all
our
chaps
were
fighting
on
top
of
me
d
tell
me
gasped
callaghan
incredulously
i
could
feel
the
boots
jim
said
i
bruised
with
them
yet
what
time
did
we
go
over
that
morning
nine
was
it
it
was
sir
well
it
was
twelve
or
one
when
they
dug
me
out
they
the
trench
and
started
to
dig
themselves
in
and
they
found
me
i
a
on
my
hand
my
aunt
that
was
a
long
three
hours
did
they
treat
you
decent
sir
they
were
too
bad
jim
said
i
could
move
i
suppose
it
was
the
weight
on
me
and
the
bruising
at
least
i
hope
so
they
felt
me
all
over
there
was
a
rather
decent
lieutenant
there
who
gave
me
some
brandy
he
told
me
he
did
think
there
was
anything
broken
but
i
could
stir
and
it
hurt
like
fury
when
they
touched
me
and
how
long
were
you
there
sir
they
had
to
keep
me
until
night
there
was
no
way
of
sending
back
prisoners
so
i
lay
on
a
and
the
talked
to
me
he
had
been
to
school
in
england
that
where
they
larned
him
any
decency
he
had
said
callaghan
it
might
be
but
he
was
a
bad
sort
he
looked
after
me
well
enough
then
after
nightfall
they
sent
a
stretcher
party
over
with
me
the
german
boy
shook
hands
with
me
when
we
were
starting
and
said
he
was
afraid
he
would
see
me
again
as
we
were
pretty
sure
to
be
shelled
by
the
british
and
were
you
sir
rather
the
first
thing
i
knew
was
a
bit
of
shrapnel
through
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
i
looked
for
the
hole
this
morning
to
see
if
i
was
remembering
rightly
and
sure
enough
here
it
is
he
held
up
his
arm
and
showed
a
jagged
tear
in
his
tunic
but
that
where
i
stop
remembering
anything
i
suppose
i
must
have
caught
something
else
then
why
is
my
head
tied
up
it
was
all
right
when
they
began
to
carry
me
over
ye
have
a
lump
the
size
of
an
egg
low
down
on
the
back
of
your
head
sir
said
callaghan
and
a
nasty
little
cut
near
your
temple
h
said
jim
i
wondered
why
it
ached
well
i
must
have
got
those
from
our
side
on
the
way
across
i
hope
they
got
a
boche
or
two
as
well
i
dunno
callaghan
said
the
fellas
that
dumped
you
down
said
something
in
their
own
haythin
tongue
i
did
understand
it
but
it
sounded
as
if
they
were
glad
to
be
rid
of
you
well
i
would
blame
them
jim
said
i
not
exactly
a
featherweight
and
it
ca
be
much
fun
to
be
killed
carrying
the
enemy
about
whether
you
a
boche
or
not
he
lay
for
a
while
silently
thinking
did
they
know
at
home
yet
he
wondered
anxiously
and
then
he
suddenly
realized
that
his
fall
must
have
looked
like
certain
death
that
if
they
had
heard
anything
it
would
be
that
he
had
been
killed
he
turned
cold
at
the
thought
had
they
heard
his
father
norah
and
wally
what
did
he
think
was
wally
himself
alive
he
might
even
be
a
prisoner
he
turned
at
that
thought
to
callaghan
his
sudden
move
bringing
a
stifled
cry
to
his
lips
did
they
are
there
any
other
officers
of
my
regiment
here
there
are
not
said
callaghan
i
got
the
priest
to
look
at
your
badges
sir
the
way
he
could
find
out
if
there
was
anny
more
of
ye
but
there
is
not
them
that
here
is
mostly
dublins
and
munsters
with
a
sprinkling
of
canadians
there
not
an
officer
or
man
of
the
blankshires
here
at
all
barring
yourself
will
the
germans
let
us
communicate
with
our
people
communicate
is
it
said
the
irishman
yerra
they
not
let
anyone
send
so
much
as
a
scratch
on
a
he
dropped
his
voice
whisht
now
sir
the
priest
taking
all
our
addresses
and
he
do
his
best
to
send
word
to
every
one
at
home
but
can
he
depend
on
getting
through
faith
he
can
not
but
is
the
only
chance
we
got
the
poor
man
nothing
but
a
prisoner
himself
he
watched
if
he
goes
tin
yards
from
the
church
so
i
dunno
at
all
will
he
ever
manage
it
with
the
suspicions
they
have
of
him
jim
sighed
impatiently
he
could
do
nothing
then
nothing
to
keep
the
blow
from
falling
on
the
two
dear
ones
at
home
he
thought
of
trying
to
bribe
the
german
guards
and
felt
for
his
but
it
was
gone
some
careful
boche
had
managed
to
relieve
him
of
it
while
he
had
been
unconscious
and
he
was
helpless
a
log
while
over
in
england
norah
and
his
father
were
perhaps
already
mourning
him
as
dead
his
thoughts
travelled
to
billabong
where
brownie
and
murty
and
the
others
kept
the
home
ready
for
them
all
working
with
the
love
that
makes
nothing
a
toil
and
planning
always
for
the
great
day
that
should
bring
them
all
back
he
pictured
the
news
arriving
saw
brownie
dismayed
old
face
and
heard
her
cry
of
incredulous
pain
and
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
it
seemed
unbelievable
that
such
things
could
be
in
a
sane
world
but
then
the
world
was
no
longer
sane
it
had
gone
mad
nearly
two
years
before
and
he
was
only
one
of
the
myriad
atoms
caught
into
the
swirl
of
its
madness
the
came
again
presently
and
saw
his
troubled
face
you
are
in
pain
my
son
no
i
all
right
if
i
keep
quiet
jim
answered
but
it
my
people
callaghan
says
you
will
try
to
let
them
know
father
i
am
learning
you
all
said
the
priest
names
regiments
and
numbers
is
it
not
i
dare
not
put
them
on
paper
i
have
been
searched
three
times
already
even
to
my
shoes
but
i
hope
that
my
chance
will
come
before
long
then
i
will
send
them
to
your
war
office
he
beamed
down
on
jim
so
hopefully
that
it
seemed
rather
likely
that
he
would
find
a
private
telegraph
office
of
his
own
suddenly
now
i
will
learn
your
name
and
regiment
he
repeated
them
several
times
nodding
his
head
yes
that
is
an
easy
one
he
said
some
of
them
are
very
terrible
to
a
frenchman
our
friend
here
he
looked
quaintly
at
callaghan
has
a
name
which
it
twists
the
tongue
to
say
and
now
my
son
i
would
like
to
examine
you
since
you
are
conscious
i
am
the
only
doctor
a
poor
one
i
fear
but
perhaps
we
will
find
out
together
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
uneasy
about
that
indeed
was
what
they
did
find
out
after
a
rather
agonizing
jim
was
quite
unable
to
move
his
legs
being
so
bruised
that
there
was
scarcely
a
square
inch
of
him
that
was
not
green
and
blue
and
purple
one
hip
bore
the
complete
impress
of
a
foot
livid
and
angry
yes
that
chap
jumped
on
me
from
a
good
height
jim
said
when
the
exclaimed
at
it
i
thought
he
had
smashed
my
leg
he
went
near
it
said
the
indeed
my
son
you
are
beaten
to
a
jelly
but
that
will
recover
itself
you
can
breathe
without
pain
that
is
well
now
we
will
look
at
the
head
he
unwrapped
the
bandages
and
felt
the
lump
tenderly
ah
that
is
better
a
little
concussion
i
think
it
is
that
which
kept
you
so
quiet
when
you
stayed
with
us
at
first
and
the
cut
heals
well
that
comes
of
being
young
and
strong
with
clean
healthy
blood
he
bathed
the
head
and
replaced
the
bandages
sighing
that
he
had
no
clean
ones
but
with
you
it
matters
little
you
will
not
need
them
in
a
few
days
then
perhaps
we
will
wash
these
and
they
will
be
ready
for
the
next
poor
boy
he
smiled
at
jim
move
those
legs
as
much
as
you
can
my
son
and
rub
them
he
trotted
away
and
that
same
is
good
advice
said
callaghan
it
will
hurt
to
move
sir
and
you
beaten
to
a
pulp
first
and
then
stiffening
for
the
three
days
you
after
lying
here
is
all
i
wish
i
could
rub
you
with
a
good
bottle
of
elliman
to
do
it
with
but
if
them
huns
move
you
hurt
a
mighty
lot
more
than
if
you
move
yourself
themselves
is
the
boys
for
that
they
think
they
got
a
feather
in
their
caps
if
they
get
an
extra
yelp
out
of
annywan
so
do
the
best
you
can
sir
i
will
said
jim
and
did
his
best
for
long
hours
every
day
it
was
weary
work
with
each
movement
torture
and
for
a
time
very
little
encouragement
came
in
the
shape
of
improvement
then
slowly
with
rubbing
and
exercise
the
stiffened
muscles
began
to
relax
callaghan
cheered
him
on
forgetting
his
own
aching
leg
in
his
sympathy
for
the
boy
in
his
silent
torment
in
the
intervals
of
physical
jerks
jim
talked
to
his
little
neighbour
whose
delight
knew
no
bounds
when
he
heard
that
jim
knew
and
cared
for
his
country
he
himself
was
a
cork
man
with
a
wife
and
two
sons
jim
gathered
that
their
equal
was
not
to
be
found
in
any
town
in
ireland
callaghan
occasionally
lamented
the
foolishness
that
had
kept
him
in
the
army
when
he
had
a
right
to
be
home
looking
after
hughie
and
larry
is
not
much
the
army
gives
you
and
you
giving
it
the
best
years
of
your
life
he
said
i
be
better
out
of
it
and
home
with
me
boys
then
you
would
let
them
go
to
the
war
if
they
were
old
enough
jim
asked
if
they
were
old
enough
not
be
asking
my
liberty
they
be
rejoined
callaghan
proudly
is
it
sons
that
shtand
out
of
a
fight
like
this
he
glared
at
jim
loftily
unconscious
of
any
inconsistency
in
his
remarks
well
there
plenty
of
your
that
wo
go
and
fight
cally
said
the
man
beyond
him
a
big
yorkshireman
there
that
in
all
countries
said
callaghan
calmly
they
all
go
in
your
part
of
the
country
did
they
till
they
were
made
faith
i
towld
there
a
few
there
yet
in
odd
corners
and
likely
to
be
till
after
the
war
the
men
round
roared
joyfully
at
the
expense
of
the
yorkshireman
and
is
not
in
ireland
we
have
that
quare
baste
the
objector
went
on
callaghan
rolling
the
syllables
lovingly
on
his
tongue
that
an
animal
a
man
would
like
to
meet
now
whatever
our
objectors
are
in
ireland
they
surely
never
jim
gave
a
crack
of
laughter
that
brought
the
roving
grey
eye
squarely
upon
him
even
in
australia
that
the
captain
country
said
the
soft
irish
voice
i
heard
tell
there
a
boy
or
two
there
out
of
khaki
maybe
they
holding
back
for
conscription
too
but
wherever
the
boys
are
that
do
go
none
of
them
have
a
song
and
dance
made
about
them
barring
only
the
irish
what
about
your
sinn
feiners
some
one
sang
out
callaghan
face
fell
yerra
they
have
the
country
destroyed
he
admitted
and
nine
out
of
every
ten
do
know
annything
about
politics
or
annything
else
at
all
only
they
get
talked
over
and
towld
that
they
patriots
if
they
get
howld
of
a
gun
and
do
a
little
drilling
at
night
where
the
country
boy
that
would
give
his
ears
for
a
gun
the
english
that
could
stop
it
all
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
has
the
pluck
to
bring
in
conscription
in
ireland
you
right
there
cally
said
some
one
i
know
well
i
right
but
the
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
irish
boys
that
went
to
the
war
and
fought
till
they
died
they
be
forgotten
and
the
sinn
fein
scum
be
remembered
if
the
had
the
pluck
of
a
mouse
they
be
all
right
i
tell
you
boys
be
the
own
fault
if
we
see
the
haythin
turks
parading
the
fair
fields
of
ireland
with
their
long
tails
held
up
by
the
sinn
feiners
callaghan
relapsed
into
gloomy
contemplation
of
this
awful
possibility
and
refused
to
be
drawn
further
even
when
jim
desiring
to
be
tactful
mentioned
a
famous
irish
who
had
slain
eight
germans
he
declined
to
show
any
enthusiasm
ah
what
he
said
sourly
sure
his
owld
father
would
make
a
fuss
of
him
did
he
do
more
says
he
often
laid
out
twenty
men
myself
with
a
stick
and
i
coming
from
macroom
fair
it
is
a
bad
trial
of
mick
that
he
could
kill
only
eight
and
he
having
a
rifle
and
bayonet
he
says
cock
him
up
with
a
after
which
jim
ceased
to
be
consoling
and
began
to
exercise
his
worst
leg
knowing
well
that
the
sight
of
his
torments
would
speedily
melt
denny
heart
and
make
him
forget
the
sorrows
of
ireland
the
guards
did
not
trouble
them
much
they
kept
a
strict
watch
which
was
not
difficult
as
all
the
prisoners
were
partially
disabled
and
then
considered
their
duty
discharged
by
bringing
twice
a
day
the
invariable
meal
of
soup
and
bread
no
one
liked
to
speculate
on
what
had
gone
to
the
making
of
the
soup
it
was
a
pale
greasy
liquid
with
strange
lumps
in
it
and
tasted
as
may
be
supposed
to
taste
jim
learned
to
eat
the
sour
bread
by
soaking
it
in
the
soup
he
had
no
inclination
to
eat
but
he
forced
himself
to
swallow
the
disgusting
meals
so
that
he
might
keep
up
his
strength
just
as
he
worked
his
stiff
limbs
and
rubbed
them
most
of
the
day
for
there
was
but
one
idea
in
jim
linton
mind
escape
gradually
he
became
able
to
sit
up
and
then
to
move
a
little
hobbling
painfully
on
a
stick
which
had
been
part
of
a
broken
pew
and
endeavouring
to
take
part
in
looking
after
the
helpless
prisoners
and
in
keeping
the
church
clean
since
the
guards
laughed
at
the
idea
of
helping
at
either
jim
had
seen
something
of
the
treatment
given
to
wounded
german
soldiers
in
england
and
he
writhed
to
think
of
them
tended
as
though
they
were
our
own
sick
while
british
prisoners
lay
and
starved
in
filthy
holes
but
the
little
rebuked
him
but
what
would
you
my
son
they
are
without
breeding
without
decency
without
hearts
are
we
to
put
ourselves
on
that
level
i
suppose
not
but
it
a
big
difference
father
jim
muttered
the
bigger
the
difference
the
more
honour
on
our
side
said
the
little
priest
and
things
pass
long
after
you
and
i
and
all
these
poor
lads
are
forgotten
it
will
be
remembered
that
we
came
out
of
this
war
with
our
heads
up
but
they
suddenly
fierce
scorn
filled
his
quiet
eyes
they
will
be
the
outcasts
of
the
world
wherefore
jim
worked
on
and
tried
to
take
comfort
by
the
philosophy
although
there
were
many
times
when
he
found
it
hard
to
digest
it
was
all
very
well
to
be
cheerful
about
the
verdict
of
the
future
but
difficult
to
forget
the
insistent
present
with
the
heel
of
the
hun
on
his
neck
it
was
sometimes
easier
to
be
philosophic
by
dreaming
of
days
when
the
positions
should
be
reversed
he
was
able
to
walk
a
little
when
the
order
came
to
move
the
guards
became
suddenly
busy
officers
whom
the
prisoners
had
not
seen
before
came
in
and
out
and
one
evening
the
helpless
were
put
roughly
into
farm
carts
and
taken
to
the
station
while
those
able
to
move
by
themselves
were
marched
after
them
marched
quickly
with
bayonet
points
ready
behind
them
to
prod
stragglers
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
were
thrust
roughly
into
closed
trucks
looking
back
for
the
last
time
on
the
little
who
had
marched
beside
them
with
an
arm
for
two
sick
men
and
now
stood
on
the
platform
looking
wistfully
at
them
he
put
up
his
hand
solemnly
god
keep
you
my
sons
a
german
soldier
elbowed
him
roughly
aside
the
doors
of
the
trucks
were
clashed
together
leaving
them
in
darkness
and
presently
with
straining
and
rattling
and
clanging
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
next
stop
germany
said
denny
callaghan
from
the
corner
where
he
had
been
put
down
and
not
a
ticket
between
the
lot
of
us
chapter
xvi
through
the
darkness
i
think
that
the
last
load
jim
linton
said
he
had
wriggled
backwards
out
of
a
black
hole
in
the
side
of
a
black
cupboard
and
now
sat
back
on
his
heels
gasping
his
only
article
of
attire
was
a
pair
of
short
trousers
from
his
hair
to
his
heels
he
was
caked
with
dirt
well
praise
the
pigs
for
that
said
a
voice
from
the
blackness
of
the
cupboard
some
one
switched
on
a
tiny
electric
light
then
it
could
be
seen
dimly
that
the
cupboard
was
just
large
enough
to
hold
four
men
crouching
so
closely
that
they
almost
touched
each
other
all
were
dressed
or
undressed
as
jim
was
all
were
equally
dirty
their
blackened
faces
were
set
and
grim
and
whether
they
spoke
or
moved
or
merely
sat
still
they
were
listening
listening
all
four
were
british
officers
marsh
and
fullerton
were
subalterns
belonging
to
a
cavalry
regiment
desmond
was
a
captain
a
dublin
fusilier
and
jim
linton
completed
the
quartette
and
they
sat
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
under
the
floor
of
an
officers
barrack
in
a
westphalian
the
yawning
opening
in
front
of
them
represented
five
months
ceaseless
work
night
after
night
it
was
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
i
dreamed
that
we
crawled
in
marsh
said
in
a
whisper
they
had
all
learned
to
hear
the
faintest
murmur
of
speech
and
we
crawled
and
crawled
and
crawled
for
years
it
seemed
and
then
we
saw
daylight
ahead
and
we
crawled
out
in
piccadilly
circus
that
was
tunnel
even
in
a
dream
desmond
said
i
feel
as
if
it
were
tunnel
now
remarked
jim
still
breathing
heavily
yes
you
had
a
long
spell
linton
we
were
just
beginning
to
think
something
was
wrong
i
thought
i
might
as
well
finish
and
then
another
bit
of
roof
fell
in
and
i
had
to
fix
it
jim
answered
well
it
wo
be
gardening
that
i
go
in
for
when
i
get
back
to
australia
i
dug
enough
here
to
last
me
my
life
hear
hear
said
some
one
and
what
now
bed
i
think
desmond
said
and
night
the
last
crawl
down
that
beastly
if
we
luck
only
this
time
we
crawl
back
he
felt
within
a
little
hollow
in
the
earth
wall
and
brought
out
some
empty
tins
and
some
bottles
of
water
and
slowly
painstakingly
they
washed
off
the
dirt
that
encrusted
them
it
was
a
long
business
and
at
the
end
of
it
desmond
inspected
them
all
and
was
himself
inspected
to
make
sure
that
no
streaks
remained
finally
he
nodded
satisfied
and
then
with
infinite
caution
he
slid
back
a
panel
and
peered
out
into
blackness
having
first
extinguished
their
little
light
there
was
no
sound
he
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
returned
after
a
few
moments
all
clear
he
whispered
and
vanished
one
by
one
they
followed
him
each
man
gliding
noiselessly
away
they
had
donned
uniform
coats
and
trousers
before
leaving
and
closed
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
with
a
round
screen
of
rough
interlaced
twigs
which
they
plastered
with
earth
the
tins
were
buried
again
with
the
bottles
ordinarily
each
man
carried
away
an
empty
bottle
to
be
brought
back
next
night
filled
with
water
but
there
was
no
further
need
of
this
night
please
god
there
would
be
no
returning
no
washing
crouched
in
the
darkness
to
escape
the
eagle
eye
of
the
guards
no
bitter
toil
in
the
darkness
listening
with
strained
ears
all
the
while
jim
was
the
last
to
leave
he
slid
the
panel
into
position
and
placed
against
it
the
brooms
and
mops
used
in
keeping
the
barrack
clean
as
he
handled
them
one
by
one
a
brush
slipped
and
clattered
ever
so
slightly
he
caught
at
it
desperately
and
then
stood
motionless
beads
of
perspiration
breaking
out
upon
his
forehead
but
no
sound
came
from
without
and
presently
he
breathed
more
freely
he
stood
in
a
cupboard
under
the
stairs
it
was
desmond
who
first
realized
that
there
must
be
space
beyond
it
who
had
planned
a
way
in
and
thence
to
cut
a
tunnel
to
freedom
they
had
found
or
stolen
or
manufactured
tools
and
had
cut
the
sliding
panel
so
cunningly
that
none
of
the
germans
who
used
the
had
suspected
its
existence
the
space
on
the
far
side
of
the
wall
had
given
them
room
to
begin
their
work
gradually
it
had
been
filled
with
earth
until
there
was
barely
space
for
them
to
move
then
the
earth
as
they
dug
it
out
had
to
be
laboriously
thrust
under
the
floor
of
the
building
which
was
luckily
raised
a
little
above
ground
they
had
managed
to
secrete
some
wire
and
having
tapped
the
electric
supply
which
lit
the
barrack
had
carried
a
into
their
but
the
tunnel
itself
had
for
the
most
part
been
done
in
utter
blackness
three
times
the
roof
had
fallen
in
badly
on
the
second
occasion
nearly
burying
jim
and
fullerton
it
was
considered
now
that
linton
was
a
difficult
man
to
bury
with
an
unconquerable
habit
of
resurrecting
himself
a
score
of
times
they
had
narrowly
escaped
detection
for
five
months
they
had
lived
in
a
daily
and
nightly
agony
of
fear
not
of
discovery
itself
or
its
certain
savage
punishment
but
of
losing
their
chance
there
were
eight
officers
altogether
in
the
syndicate
and
four
others
knew
of
their
plan
four
who
were
keen
to
help
but
too
badly
disabled
from
wounds
to
hope
for
anything
but
the
end
of
the
war
they
worked
in
shifts
of
four
one
quartette
stealing
underground
each
night
as
soon
as
the
guards
relaxed
their
vigil
while
the
others
remained
in
the
dormitories
ready
to
signal
to
the
working
party
should
any
alarm
occur
and
if
possible
to
create
a
disturbance
to
hold
the
attention
of
the
germans
for
a
little
they
had
succeeded
in
saving
the
situation
three
times
when
a
surprise
was
made
during
the
night
thanks
to
another
wire
which
carried
an
electric
alarm
signal
underground
from
the
dormitory
baylis
who
had
been
an
electrical
engineer
in
time
of
peace
had
managed
the
wiring
it
was
believed
among
the
syndicate
that
when
baylis
needed
any
electric
fitting
very
badly
he
simply
went
and
thought
about
it
so
hard
that
it
materialized
like
the
gentleman
who
evolved
a
camel
out
of
his
inner
consciousness
one
of
the
romances
of
the
great
war
might
be
written
about
the
way
in
which
prisoners
bent
on
escape
were
able
to
obtain
materials
for
getting
out
and
necessary
supplies
when
once
they
were
away
from
the
camp
much
of
how
it
was
done
will
never
be
known
for
the
organization
was
kept
profoundly
secret
and
those
who
were
helped
by
it
were
often
pledged
solemnly
to
reveal
nothing
money
plenty
of
money
was
the
only
thing
necessary
given
the
command
of
that
the
prisoner
who
wished
to
break
out
would
find
mysteriously
tools
or
disguises
or
whatever
else
he
needed
within
the
camp
and
after
he
had
escaped
the
three
essentials
without
which
he
had
very
little
chance
map
compass
and
civilian
clothes
then
having
paid
enormous
sums
for
what
had
probably
cost
the
supply
system
a
few
shillings
he
was
at
liberty
to
strike
for
freedom
with
a
section
of
german
territory
a
few
miles
or
a
few
hundred
to
cross
and
finally
the
chance
of
circumventing
the
guards
on
the
dutch
frontier
it
was
so
desperate
an
undertaking
that
the
wonder
was
not
that
so
many
failed
but
that
so
many
succeeded
jim
linton
had
no
money
his
was
one
of
the
many
cases
among
prisoners
in
which
no
letters
over
seemed
to
reach
home
no
communication
to
be
opened
up
with
england
for
some
time
he
had
not
been
permitted
to
write
having
unfortunately
managed
to
incur
the
enmity
of
the
camp
commandant
by
failing
to
salute
him
with
the
precise
degree
of
servility
which
that
official
considered
necessary
to
his
dignity
then
when
at
length
he
was
allowed
to
send
an
occasional
letter
he
waited
in
vain
for
any
reply
either
from
his
home
or
his
regiment
possibly
the
commandant
knew
why
he
used
to
look
at
jim
with
an
evil
triumph
in
his
eye
which
made
the
boy
long
to
take
him
by
his
fat
throat
and
ask
him
whether
indeed
his
letters
ever
got
farther
than
the
office
basket
other
officers
in
the
camp
would
have
written
about
him
to
their
friends
so
that
the
information
could
be
passed
on
to
jim
father
but
in
all
probability
their
letters
also
would
have
been
suppressed
and
jim
refused
to
allow
them
to
take
the
risk
letters
were
too
precious
and
went
astray
too
easily
it
was
not
fair
to
add
to
the
chances
of
their
failing
to
reach
those
who
longed
for
them
at
home
and
then
there
was
always
the
hope
that
his
own
might
really
have
got
through
even
though
delayed
that
some
day
might
come
answers
telling
that
at
last
his
father
and
norah
and
wally
were
no
longer
mourning
him
as
dead
he
clung
to
the
hope
though
one
mail
day
after
another
left
him
bitterly
disappointed
in
a
german
there
was
little
to
do
except
hope
jim
would
have
fared
badly
enough
on
the
miserable
food
of
the
camp
but
for
the
other
officers
they
received
parcels
regularly
the
contents
of
which
were
dumped
into
a
common
store
and
jim
and
another
orphan
were
made
honorary
members
of
the
mess
with
such
genuine
heartiness
that
after
the
first
protests
they
ceased
to
worry
their
hosts
with
objections
and
merely
tried
to
eat
as
little
as
possible
jim
thought
about
them
gratefully
on
this
last
night
as
he
slipped
out
of
the
cupboard
and
made
his
way
upstairs
moving
noiselessly
as
a
cat
on
the
bare
boards
what
good
chaps
they
were
how
they
had
made
him
welcome
even
though
his
coming
meant
that
they
went
hungrier
they
were
such
a
gay
laughing
little
band
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
did
not
play
the
game
keeping
a
cheery
front
to
the
world
and
meeting
privation
and
wretchedness
with
a
joke
and
a
shrug
if
that
was
british
spirit
then
jim
decided
that
to
be
british
was
a
pretty
big
thing
it
was
thanks
to
desmond
and
fullerton
that
he
had
been
able
to
join
the
syndicate
they
had
plenty
of
money
and
had
insisted
on
lending
him
his
share
of
the
expenses
representing
when
he
had
hesitated
that
they
needed
his
strength
for
the
work
of
tunnelling
after
which
jim
had
laboured
far
more
mightily
than
they
had
ever
wished
or
even
suspected
he
was
fit
and
strong
again
now
lean
and
pinched
as
were
they
all
but
in
hard
training
hope
had
keyed
him
up
to
a
high
pitch
the
last
night
in
this
a
light
flashed
downstairs
and
a
door
flung
open
just
as
he
reached
the
landing
jim
sprang
to
his
dormitory
flinging
off
his
coat
as
he
ran
with
leaping
stealthy
strides
feet
were
tramping
up
the
stairs
behind
him
he
dived
into
his
blankets
and
drew
them
up
under
his
chin
just
as
he
had
dived
hurriedly
into
bed
a
score
of
times
at
school
when
an
intrusive
master
had
come
upon
a
midnight
spread
but
with
his
heart
pounding
with
fear
as
it
had
never
pounded
at
school
what
did
they
suspect
had
they
found
out
anything
the
guard
tramped
noisily
into
the
room
under
a
big
feldwebel
or
he
flashed
his
lantern
down
the
long
room
and
uttered
a
sharp
word
of
command
that
brought
the
sleepers
to
their
feet
blinking
and
but
half
awake
then
he
called
the
roll
pausing
when
he
came
to
jim
you
sleep
in
a
curious
dress
where
is
your
shirt
drying
said
jim
curtly
i
washed
it
i
only
one
enough
for
an
english
said
the
german
contemptuously
he
passed
on
to
the
next
man
and
jim
sighed
with
relief
presently
the
guard
clanked
out
and
the
prisoners
returned
to
their
straw
mattresses
that
was
near
enough
whispered
baylis
who
was
next
to
jim
a
good
deal
too
near
jim
answered
however
it
ought
to
be
fairly
certain
that
they
wo
spring
another
on
us
and
a
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
he
turned
over
and
in
a
moment
was
sleeping
like
a
baby
the
next
day
dragged
cruelly
to
the
eight
conspirators
it
seemed
as
long
as
the
weary
stretch
of
months
since
they
had
come
to
the
camp
for
a
long
while
they
had
avoided
each
other
as
far
as
possible
in
public
knowing
that
even
two
men
who
talked
much
together
were
liable
to
be
suspected
of
plotting
on
this
last
day
they
became
afraid
even
to
look
at
each
other
and
wandered
about
each
endeavouring
to
put
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
between
himself
and
the
other
seven
it
became
rather
like
a
curious
game
of
and
by
evening
they
were
thoroughly
jumpy
with
their
nerves
all
on
edge
they
had
no
preparations
to
make
scarcely
any
of
their
few
possessions
could
be
taken
with
them
they
would
find
outside
if
ever
they
got
there
food
and
clothing
they
had
managed
to
make
rough
knives
that
were
fairly
serviceable
weapons
beyond
these
and
a
few
small
personal
belongings
they
took
nothing
except
the
clothes
they
wore
and
they
wore
as
little
as
possible
and
those
the
oldest
and
shabbiest
things
to
be
found
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
all
that
last
day
but
watch
the
slow
hours
pass
and
endeavour
to
avoid
falling
foul
of
any
of
the
guards
no
easy
matter
since
every
german
delighted
in
any
chance
of
making
trouble
for
a
prisoner
nothing
but
to
think
and
plan
as
they
had
planned
and
thought
a
thousand
times
before
to
wonder
desperately
was
all
safe
still
had
the
door
been
found
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
was
the
tunnel
safe
or
had
it
chosen
of
all
days
to
fall
in
again
was
the
exit
in
a
bed
of
runner
beans
already
known
and
watched
the
huns
were
so
cunning
in
their
watchfulness
it
was
quite
likely
that
they
knew
all
about
their
desperate
enterprise
and
were
only
waiting
to
pounce
upon
them
in
the
instant
that
success
should
seem
within
their
grasp
that
was
how
they
loved
to
catch
prisoners
the
afternoon
dragged
to
a
close
they
ate
their
supper
without
appetite
which
was
a
pity
since
the
meagre
store
of
food
in
the
mess
had
been
recklessly
ransacked
to
give
them
a
good
then
another
hour
muttering
now
and
then
as
they
prowled
about
and
finally
to
bed
to
lie
there
for
hours
of
darkness
and
silence
gradually
the
noise
of
the
camp
died
down
from
the
came
for
a
while
loud
voices
and
harsh
laughter
then
quiet
fell
there
too
and
presently
the
night
watch
tramped
through
the
barrack
on
its
last
visit
of
inspection
flashing
lanterns
into
the
faces
of
the
prisoners
the
inspection
seemed
unusually
thorough
it
set
their
strained
nerves
quivering
anew
then
came
an
hour
of
utter
stillness
and
darkness
the
eight
prisoners
lying
with
clenched
hands
and
set
teeth
listening
with
terrible
intentness
finally
when
jim
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
must
move
or
go
mad
a
final
signal
came
from
the
doorway
he
heard
baylis
say
thank
god
under
his
breath
as
they
slipped
out
of
bed
in
the
darkness
and
felt
their
way
downstairs
they
were
the
last
to
come
the
others
were
all
crouched
in
the
cupboard
waiting
for
them
as
they
reached
its
door
and
just
as
they
did
so
the
outer
doorway
swung
open
with
a
blaze
of
light
and
the
big
feldwebel
strode
in
shut
the
door
jim
whispered
he
launched
himself
at
the
german
as
he
spoke
with
a
spring
like
a
panther
his
fist
caught
him
between
the
eyes
and
he
went
down
headlong
the
lantern
rolling
into
a
corner
jim
knew
nothing
of
what
followed
he
was
on
top
of
the
feldwebel
pounding
his
head
on
the
floor
prepared
in
his
agony
of
despair
to
do
as
much
damage
as
possible
before
his
brief
dash
for
freedom
ended
then
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
heard
desmond
sharp
whisper
steady
he
unconscious
let
me
look
at
him
linton
jim
still
astride
his
capture
sat
back
and
desmond
flashed
the
feldwebel
own
lantern
into
that
hero
face
h
yes
he
said
hit
his
head
against
something
he
stunned
anyhow
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
him
is
he
the
only
one
jim
asked
it
seems
like
it
but
there
may
be
another
at
any
moment
we
got
to
go
on
if
he
wakes
up
he
probably
be
able
to
identify
you
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
coil
of
strong
cord
come
along
linton
get
off
and
help
me
to
tie
him
up
they
tied
up
the
unconscious
feldwebel
securely
and
lifted
him
into
the
cupboard
among
the
brooms
gagging
him
in
case
he
felt
inclined
for
any
outcry
on
coming
to
his
senses
the
others
had
gone
ahead
and
were
already
in
the
tunnel
with
them
one
of
the
four
disabled
officers
whose
job
it
was
to
close
up
the
hole
at
the
entrance
and
dismantle
the
electric
light
in
the
faint
hope
that
the
germans
might
fail
to
discover
their
means
of
escape
and
so
leave
it
free
for
another
party
to
try
for
freedom
he
stood
by
the
yawning
hole
holding
one
end
of
a
string
by
which
they
were
to
signal
from
the
surface
if
all
went
well
the
wistfulness
of
his
face
haunted
jim
long
afterwards
old
man
he
said
cheerily
gripping
jim
hand
good
luck
i
wish
you
were
coming
harrison
jim
said
unhappily
no
such
luck
cheero
though
the
war
wo
last
for
ever
i
see
you
in
blighty
they
shook
hands
again
and
jim
dived
into
the
tunnel
he
knew
every
inch
of
it
and
wriggled
quickly
along
until
the
top
of
his
head
encountered
the
boots
of
the
man
in
front
of
him
after
which
he
went
more
slowly
there
seemed
a
long
delay
at
the
end
long
enough
to
make
him
break
into
a
sweat
of
fear
lest
something
should
have
gone
wrong
such
thoughts
come
easily
enough
when
you
are
lying
full
length
in
black
darkness
in
a
hole
just
large
enough
to
hold
a
man
in
air
so
stifling
that
the
laboured
breath
can
scarcely
come
with
the
dank
earth
just
under
mouth
and
nose
and
overhead
a
roof
that
may
fall
in
at
any
moment
the
dragging
minutes
went
by
then
just
as
despair
seized
him
the
boots
ahead
moved
he
wriggled
after
them
finding
himself
praying
desperately
as
he
went
a
rush
of
sweet
air
came
to
him
and
then
a
hand
stretching
down
caught
his
shoulder
and
helped
him
out
it
was
faintly
moonlight
they
stood
in
a
thick
plantation
of
runner
beans
trained
on
rough
in
a
garden
beyond
the
fence
of
the
camp
the
tunnel
had
turned
sharply
upwards
at
the
end
they
had
brought
with
them
some
boards
and
other
materials
for
filling
it
up
and
now
they
set
to
work
furiously
after
giving
the
signal
with
the
string
to
harrison
the
three
sharp
tugs
that
meant
all
clear
the
boards
held
the
earth
they
shovelled
in
with
their
hands
they
stamped
it
flat
and
then
scattered
loose
earth
on
top
with
leaves
and
rubbish
working
with
desperate
energy
fearing
each
moment
to
hear
the
alarm
raised
within
the
barrack
finally
all
but
desmond
gained
the
beaten
earth
of
the
path
while
he
followed
trying
to
remove
all
trace
of
footprints
on
the
soft
earth
he
joined
them
in
a
moment
if
they
do
worry
much
about
those
beans
for
a
few
days
they
may
not
notice
anything
he
said
come
along
so
often
had
they
studied
the
way
from
behind
the
that
they
did
not
need
even
the
dim
moonlight
they
hurried
through
the
garden
with
stealthy
strides
bending
low
behind
a
row
of
and
so
over
a
low
hedge
and
out
into
a
field
beyond
there
they
ran
desperately
at
first
and
gradually
slackening
to
a
steady
trot
that
carried
them
across
country
for
a
mile
and
then
out
upon
a
highroad
where
there
was
no
sign
of
life
at
a
two
miles
further
on
they
halted
we
break
up
here
desmond
said
you
can
find
your
all
right
you
think
baylis
oh
yes
baylis
nodded
it
had
been
thought
too
dangerous
for
so
many
to
try
to
escape
together
so
two
of
clothes
and
food
had
been
arranged
later
they
would
break
up
again
into
couples
then
we
better
hurry
good
night
you
fellows
and
good
luck
we
have
the
biggest
dinner
in
blighty
together
when
we
all
get
there
good
luck
baylis
led
his
party
down
a
road
to
the
east
and
jim
fullerton
and
marsh
struck
south
after
desmond
who
paused
now
and
then
to
consult
a
rough
map
by
a
on
and
on
by
a
network
of
lanes
skirting
farmhouses
where
dogs
might
bark
flinging
themselves
flat
in
a
ditch
once
when
a
regiment
of
uhlans
swept
by
unconscious
of
the
gasping
fugitives
a
few
yards
away
jim
sat
up
and
looked
after
their
retreating
ranks
by
jove
i
wish
we
could
borrow
a
few
of
their
horses
might
buck
you
off
my
son
said
desmond
come
on
a
little
wood
showed
before
them
presently
and
desmond
sighed
with
relief
that
our
place
i
think
he
looked
at
the
map
again
we
got
to
make
for
the
corner
and
find
a
big
hollow
tree
they
brushed
through
the
firs
starting
in
fear
as
an
owl
flew
out
above
them
hooting
dismally
it
was
not
easy
to
find
anything
for
the
moonlight
was
scarcely
able
to
filter
through
the
branches
jim
took
the
lead
and
presently
they
scattered
to
look
for
the
tree
something
big
loomed
up
before
jim
presently
it
should
be
about
here
he
muttered
feeling
with
his
hand
for
the
hollow
then
as
he
encountered
a
bundle
he
whistled
softly
and
in
a
moment
brought
them
all
to
his
side
there
were
four
rough
suits
of
clothes
in
the
package
a
big
bag
of
bread
meat
and
chocolate
and
most
precious
of
all
a
flat
box
containing
maps
compasses
and
some
german
money
they
changed
hurriedly
thrusting
their
uniforms
deep
into
the
hollow
of
the
tree
and
covering
them
with
leaves
and
then
divided
the
food
there
was
a
faint
hint
of
dawn
in
the
sky
when
at
length
their
preparations
were
complete
well
you
know
your
general
direction
boys
desmond
said
to
marsh
and
fullerton
get
as
far
as
you
can
before
light
and
then
hide
for
the
day
hide
well
remember
they
be
looking
for
us
pretty
thoroughly
good
luck
they
shook
hands
and
hurried
away
in
different
directions
desmond
and
jim
came
out
into
open
fields
beyond
the
wood
and
settled
down
to
steady
running
over
field
after
field
sometimes
they
stumbled
over
ploughed
land
sometimes
made
their
way
between
rows
of
mangolds
or
turnips
where
their
feet
sank
deeply
into
the
yielding
soil
then
with
a
scramble
through
a
ditch
or
hedge
came
upon
grass
land
where
sheep
or
cows
gazed
stolidly
at
the
shadowy
racing
figures
the
east
brightened
with
long
streaks
of
pink
slowly
the
darkness
died
and
the
yellow
circle
of
the
sun
came
up
over
the
horizon
and
found
them
still
running
casting
anxious
glances
to
right
and
left
in
search
of
a
hang
these
open
fields
will
they
never
end
desmond
gasped
we
should
be
under
cover
now
behind
a
little
orchard
a
came
into
view
they
were
almost
upon
a
it
was
daylight
a
window
in
the
house
rattled
up
and
a
man
shouted
to
a
barking
dog
the
fugitives
ducked
by
a
sudden
impulse
and
darted
into
the
it
was
a
long
low
building
divided
into
stables
there
was
no
visible
and
despair
held
them
for
a
moment
then
jim
caught
sight
of
a
rough
ladder
leading
to
an
opening
in
the
ceiling
and
flung
his
hand
towards
it
he
had
no
speech
left
they
went
up
it
hand
over
hand
and
found
themselves
in
a
dim
loft
with
heaped
at
one
end
desmond
was
almost
done
lie
down
quick
jim
pushed
him
into
the
straw
and
covered
him
over
with
great
bundles
of
it
then
he
crawled
in
himself
pulling
the
rough
over
him
until
he
had
left
himself
only
a
commanding
the
as
he
did
so
voices
came
into
the
stable
they
held
their
breath
feeling
for
their
knives
then
desmond
smothered
a
laugh
what
did
they
say
jim
whispered
it
would
be
up
daisy
in
english
desmond
whispered
back
they
beginning
to
milk
the
cows
i
wish
they
milk
daisy
up
here
jim
grinned
man
but
thirsty
it
was
thirsty
work
lying
buried
in
the
dusty
in
the
close
airless
loft
hours
went
by
during
which
they
dared
not
move
for
when
the
milking
was
done
and
the
cows
turned
out
people
kept
coming
and
going
in
the
shed
they
picked
up
a
little
information
about
the
war
from
their
talk
jim
german
was
scanty
but
desmond
spoke
it
like
a
native
and
in
the
afternoon
a
farmer
from
some
distance
away
who
had
apparently
come
to
buy
pigs
let
fall
the
remark
that
a
number
of
prisoners
had
escaped
from
the
english
camp
no
one
seemed
much
interested
the
war
was
an
incident
not
really
mattering
so
much
in
their
estimation
as
the
sale
of
the
pigs
then
every
one
went
away
and
jim
and
his
companion
fell
asleep
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
awoke
the
sleep
had
done
them
good
but
they
were
overpoweringly
thirsty
so
thirsty
that
the
thought
of
food
without
drink
was
nauseating
the
evening
milking
was
going
on
they
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
streams
of
milk
into
the
pails
in
the
intervals
of
harsh
voices
then
the
cows
were
turned
out
and
heavy
feet
stamped
away
they
should
all
be
out
of
the
way
pretty
soon
desmond
whispered
then
we
can
make
a
move
we
must
get
to
water
somehow
or
he
broke
off
listening
lie
still
he
added
quickly
some
one
is
coming
up
for
straw
how
do
you
know
is
a
young
lady
and
she
volunteering
to
see
to
bedding
for
the
pigs
desmond
answered
the
ladder
creaked
and
peering
out
they
saw
a
shock
yellow
head
rise
into
the
the
girl
who
came
up
was
about
twenty
stoutly
built
with
a
broad
face
she
wore
rough
clothes
and
but
for
her
two
thick
plaits
of
yellow
hair
might
easily
have
passed
for
a
man
the
heavy
steps
came
slowly
across
the
floor
while
the
men
lay
trying
to
breath
so
softly
that
no
unusual
movement
should
stir
the
loose
then
to
their
amazement
she
spoke
where
are
you
she
said
in
english
astonishment
as
well
as
fear
held
them
silent
she
waited
a
moment
and
spoke
again
i
saw
you
come
in
you
need
not
be
afraid
still
they
made
no
sign
she
gave
a
short
laugh
well
if
you
will
not
answer
i
must
at
least
get
my
straw
for
my
pigs
she
stooped
and
her
great
arms
sent
the
loose
stalks
flying
in
every
direction
desmond
and
jim
sat
up
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
you
do
seem
to
want
to
be
killed
desmond
said
but
assuredly
you
will
be
if
you
raise
an
alarm
the
girl
laughed
i
could
have
done
that
all
day
if
i
had
wished
she
said
ever
since
i
saw
you
run
in
when
i
put
up
my
window
this
morning
well
what
do
you
want
money
no
she
shook
her
head
i
do
not
want
anything
i
was
brought
up
in
england
and
i
think
this
is
a
silly
war
there
is
a
bucket
of
milk
for
you
downstairs
it
will
come
up
if
one
of
you
will
pull
the
string
you
will
find
tied
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
she
laughed
if
i
go
to
get
it
you
will
think
i
am
going
to
call
for
help
jim
was
beyond
prudence
at
the
moment
he
took
three
strides
to
the
ladder
found
the
cord
and
pulled
up
a
small
bucket
three
parts
full
of
new
milk
the
girl
sat
down
on
an
empty
and
watched
them
drink
so
you
are
thirsty
indeed
she
said
now
i
have
food
she
unearthed
from
a
huge
pocket
a
package
of
bread
and
sausage
now
you
can
eat
it
is
quite
safe
and
you
could
not
leave
yet
my
uncle
is
still
wandering
about
he
is
like
most
men
they
wander
about
and
are
very
busy
but
they
never
do
any
work
i
run
the
farm
and
get
no
wages
either
but
in
england
i
got
wages
in
clapham
that
is
the
place
of
all
others
which
i
prefer
do
you
indeed
desmond
said
staring
at
this
amazing
female
but
why
did
you
leave
clapham
my
father
came
back
to
fight
he
knew
all
about
the
war
he
left
england
two
months
before
it
began
i
did
not
wish
to
leave
i
desired
to
remain
earning
good
wages
but
my
father
would
not
permit
me
and
where
is
he
now
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
not
know
fighting
killed
perhaps
but
my
uncle
graciously
offered
me
a
home
and
here
am
i
do
the
work
of
three
men
and
i
am
how
did
we
say
it
in
clapham
bored
stiff
for
england
i
wish
this
silly
old
war
would
end
so
that
i
could
return
we
trying
to
return
without
waiting
for
it
to
end
said
jim
solemnly
only
i
like
to
know
how
you
knew
what
we
were
but
what
else
could
you
be
it
is
so
funny
how
you
put
on
these
clothes
like
the
ostrich
and
think
no
one
will
guess
who
you
are
if
you
wore
his
suit
of
feathers
you
would
still
look
like
british
officers
and
nothing
else
you
encouraging
said
desmond
grimly
i
hope
all
your
nation
wo
be
as
discerning
ach
they
said
the
girl
they
see
no
farther
than
their
noses
i
too
was
like
that
before
i
went
to
clapham
it
a
pleasant
spot
said
desmond
i
do
wonder
you
improved
there
but
all
the
same
you
are
german
are
you
i
do
quite
see
why
you
want
to
befriend
us
he
took
a
satisfying
mouthful
of
sausage
but
i
glad
you
do
in
england
i
am
well
pretty
german
said
his
fair
hostess
the
boys
in
clapham
they
call
me
polly
sauer
kraut
and
i
talk
of
the
fatherland
and
sing
wacht
am
rhein
oh
yes
but
when
i
come
back
here
and
work
for
my
so
economical
uncle
on
this
beastly
farm
then
i
remember
clapham
and
i
do
not
feel
german
at
all
i
can
not
help
it
but
if
i
said
so
i
would
skinned
be
very
quickly
so
i
say
strafe
england
but
that
is
only
eyewash
well
we
think
kindly
of
one
german
woman
anyhow
said
desmond
the
last
of
your
charming
sisters
i
met
was
a
red
cross
nurse
at
a
station
where
our
train
pulled
up
when
i
was
going
through
wounded
i
asked
her
for
a
glass
of
water
and
she
brought
it
to
me
all
right
only
just
as
she
gave
it
to
me
she
spat
in
it
i
been
a
ever
since
until
i
met
you
he
lifted
the
bucket
and
looked
at
her
over
its
rim
here
your
very
good
health
miss
polly
sauer
kraut
and
may
i
meet
you
in
clapham
the
girl
beamed
oh
i
will
be
there
she
said
confidently
i
have
money
in
the
bank
in
london
i
will
have
a
little
baker
shop
and
you
will
get
such
pastry
as
the
english
can
not
make
jim
laughed
and
then
you
will
be
pretty
german
again
i
do
not
know
she
shook
her
head
no
i
think
i
will
just
be
swiss
they
will
not
know
the
difference
in
clapham
and
i
do
not
think
they
will
want
germans
back
of
course
the
germans
will
go
but
they
will
call
themselves
swiss
poles
any
old
thing
just
at
first
until
the
english
forget
the
english
always
forget
you
know
if
they
forget
all
they
got
to
remember
over
this
business
well
then
they
deserve
to
get
the
germans
back
said
desmond
grimly
always
excepting
yourself
miss
polly
you
be
an
ornament
to
whichever
nation
you
happened
to
favour
at
the
moment
he
finished
the
last
remnant
of
his
sausage
that
was
uncommonly
good
thank
you
now
do
you
think
we
could
make
a
move
i
will
see
if
my
uncle
is
safely
in
then
i
will
whistle
she
ran
down
the
ladder
and
presently
they
heard
a
low
call
and
going
down
found
her
awaiting
them
in
the
he
is
at
his
supper
so
all
is
quite
safe
she
said
now
you
had
better
take
the
third
road
to
the
right
and
keep
straight
on
it
is
not
so
direct
as
the
main
road
but
that
would
lead
you
through
several
places
where
the
police
are
very
active
and
there
is
a
reward
for
you
you
know
she
laughed
her
white
teeth
flashing
in
the
dim
shed
and
when
i
come
back
to
clapham
you
will
come
and
take
tea
at
my
little
shop
we
come
and
make
you
the
fashion
miss
polly
said
desmond
thank
you
a
thousand
times
they
swung
off
into
the
dusk
chapter
xvii
lights
out
there
was
two
of
every
single
thing
in
the
ark
said
geoffrey
firmly
the
man
in
church
read
it
out
of
the
bible
two
asked
alison
no
teddies
are
only
toys
there
was
real
bears
though
meat
ones
asked
his
sister
hopefully
yes
and
all
the
other
nanimals
who
drived
in
ole
noah
and
noah
must
they
have
had
a
time
if
you
tried
to
drive
in
our
turkeys
an
sheep
and
cows
together
there
be
awful
trouble
and
noah
had
lions
and
tigers
and
snakes
too
perhaps
he
had
good
norah
suggested
she
was
sewing
with
hunt
under
a
tree
on
the
lawn
while
the
children
played
with
a
noah
ark
on
a
table
near
them
he
need
them
geoffrey
said
but
would
be
any
good
at
driving
snakes
and
porklepines
norah
noah
might
have
been
norah
answered
prudently
they
must
have
been
used
to
it
you
see
and
i
believe
a
good
would
get
used
to
anything
funny
things
ole
noah
and
his
wore
said
geoffrey
looking
at
japhet
with
disfavour
like
only
worse
have
been
much
good
for
looking
after
nanimals
in
why
even
the
land
army
girls
wear
trousers
now
well
fashions
were
different
then
said
hunt
perhaps
too
they
took
off
the
when
they
got
inside
the
ark
and
had
trousers
underneath
where
they
keep
all
the
food
for
the
nanimals
anyhow
geoffrey
demanded
they
want
such
a
lot
and
it
would
have
to
be
all
different
sorts
of
food
tigers
would
eat
like
rabbits
and
efalunts
would
eat
buns
said
alison
anxiously
did
noah
make
vem
buns
she
could
silly
unless
she
had
a
said
geoffrey
they
could
carry
firewood
as
well
i
say
mother
do
you
think
the
ark
must
have
had
a
following
round
like
the
navy
has
it
is
mentioned
said
hunt
i
say
said
geoffrey
struck
by
a
new
idea
that
put
aside
the
question
of
supply
just
fancy
if
a
submarine
had
torpedoed
the
ark
would
it
have
been
exciting
let
do
it
in
the
bath
said
alison
delightedly
all
right
geoffrey
said
may
we
mother
oh
yes
if
you
do
get
too
wet
his
mother
said
resignedly
they
can
all
swim
that
a
comfort
we
muster
them
said
geoffrey
bundling
the
animals
into
a
heap
hand
over
that
bird
alison
i
say
mother
which
came
first
a
fowl
or
an
egg
hunt
sighed
it
is
mentioned
she
said
which
do
you
think
fowl
i
answered
her
son
fink
it
was
ve
egg
said
alison
how
would
it
be
hatched
if
it
was
silly
demanded
her
brother
they
did
have
then
alison
puckered
her
brows
and
remained
undefeated
adam
sat
on
it
she
suggested
i
can
not
imagine
adam
being
broody
said
hunt
well
anyhow
he
hatched
out
eve
said
geoffrey
no
one
ventured
to
combat
this
statement
and
the
children
formed
themselves
into
a
stretcher
party
bearing
the
ark
and
its
contents
upon
a
tray
in
the
direction
of
the
bathroom
are
they
darlings
norah
said
laughing
look
at
that
michael
michael
was
toddling
behind
the
as
fast
as
his
fat
legs
would
permit
uttering
short
and
sharp
shrieks
of
anguish
lest
he
should
be
forgotten
geoffrey
gave
the
order
halt
and
the
ark
and
its
bearers
came
to
a
standstill
come
along
kid
said
the
commanding
officer
you
can
be
the
band
the
procession
was
with
michael
in
the
lead
tooting
proudly
on
an
imaginary
bugle
they
disappeared
within
the
house
they
are
growing
so
big
and
strong
said
hunt
thankfully
michael
ca
wear
any
of
the
things
that
fitted
geoff
at
his
age
as
for
alison
nothing
seems
to
fit
her
for
more
than
a
month
or
two
then
she
gracefully
bursts
out
of
her
garments
as
for
geoff
but
he
is
getting
really
too
independent
he
went
off
by
himself
to
the
village
yesterday
and
i
found
him
playing
football
behind
one
of
the
cottages
with
a
lot
of
small
boys
oh
did
you
norah
said
looking
a
little
worried
we
heard
just
before
i
came
over
this
morning
that
there
is
a
case
of
fever
in
the
village
some
travelling
seem
to
have
brought
it
dad
said
i
must
tell
you
we
had
better
not
let
the
children
go
down
there
for
the
present
there
were
some
boys
among
the
crowd
that
geoff
was
playing
with
hunt
said
anxiously
i
do
hope
he
has
run
any
risk
he
is
wearing
the
same
clothes
too
i
take
them
off
him
and
have
them
washed
she
gathered
up
her
sewing
hurriedly
but
i
think
geoff
is
strong
enough
now
to
resist
any
germ
oh
of
course
he
is
norah
answered
still
it
does
do
any
harm
to
take
precautions
i
come
and
help
you
mrs
hunt
geoffrey
congenially
employed
as
a
submarine
commander
about
to
torpedo
the
ark
was
distinctly
annoyed
at
being
reduced
to
a
mere
small
boy
and
an
unclad
one
at
that
i
do
see
why
you
want
to
undress
me
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
he
said
wriggling
out
of
his
blue
jersey
and
it
is
either
and
alison
and
michael
go
and
sink
the
ark
without
me
if
you
do
hurry
i
wo
let
them
geoff
norah
reassured
him
i
an
airship
commander
cruising
round
over
the
submarine
and
she
does
dare
to
show
so
much
as
the
tip
of
her
periscope
of
course
when
her
captain
comes
back
he
know
what
to
do
rather
said
the
captain
wriggling
this
time
in
ecstasy
just
put
up
my
gun
and
blow
the
old
airship
to
smithereens
alison
uttered
a
howl
have
norah
made
into
smivvereens
do
you
worry
darling
i
dodge
said
norah
michael
what
are
you
doing
with
mrs
noah
not
want
my
dear
noah
dwowned
said
michael
concealing
the
lady
yet
more
securely
in
his
tiny
pocket
she
good
michael
her
oh
rubbish
michael
put
her
back
in
the
ark
said
geoffrey
wrathfully
however
can
we
have
a
proper
submarining
if
you
go
and
collar
half
the
things
never
collared
nuffig
said
michael
unmoved
only
tooked
my
dear
mrs
noah
never
mind
geoff
he
only
a
small
boy
hunt
said
a
small
boy
protested
michael
furiously
daddy
said
i
was
so
you
are
laughed
norah
catching
him
up
now
the
submarine
commander
has
on
clean
clothes
and
you
better
get
ready
to
go
on
duty
geoffrey
dashed
back
to
the
bath
with
a
shout
of
defiance
to
the
airship
and
the
destruction
of
the
ark
proceeded
gaily
there
said
hunt
putting
geoffrey
garments
into
a
tub
it
just
as
well
to
have
them
washed
but
i
really
do
think
there
any
need
to
worry
i
do
think
you
need
indeed
said
norah
laughing
as
a
medley
of
sound
came
from
the
bathroom
it
was
an
off
day
for
norah
with
miss
de
lisle
she
had
potted
and
preserved
every
variety
of
food
that
would
lend
itself
to
such
treatment
and
now
the
working
season
was
almost
over
for
the
first
time
the
home
for
tired
people
had
not
many
inmates
owing
to
the
fact
that
leave
had
been
stopped
for
several
men
at
the
front
who
had
arranged
to
spend
their
holiday
at
homewood
they
had
with
them
an
elderly
colonel
and
his
wife
harry
trevor
and
another
australian
a
silent
major
who
played
golf
every
hour
of
daylight
and
read
golf
literature
during
the
other
part
of
the
day
and
a
couple
of
sappers
on
final
leave
after
recovering
from
wounds
the
colonel
and
his
wife
had
gone
up
to
london
the
others
with
the
exception
of
major
mackay
who
as
usual
might
be
seen
afar
upon
the
links
had
gone
with
linton
to
a
sale
where
he
hoped
to
secure
some
unusually
desirable
pigs
the
sappers
happy
in
ignorance
promised
themselves
much
enjoyment
in
driving
them
home
left
alone
therefore
norah
had
gone
for
the
day
to
hunt
ostensibly
to
improve
her
french
and
needlework
but
in
reality
to
play
with
the
babies
just
how
much
the
hunt
babies
had
helped
her
only
norah
herself
knew
i
asked
to
a
festivity
the
day
after
hunt
said
that
afternoon
they
were
having
tea
in
the
pleasant
of
the
cottage
sounds
from
the
kitchen
indicated
that
eva
was
giving
her
celebrated
performance
of
a
grizzly
bear
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
the
performance
always
ended
with
a
hunt
and
with
the
slaying
of
the
quarry
by
geoffrey
after
which
the
bear
expired
with
lingering
and
unpleasant
details
douglas
colonel
is
in
london
on
leave
and
he
and
his
wife
have
asked
me
to
dine
and
go
to
a
theatre
afterwards
it
would
mean
staying
in
london
that
night
of
course
so
of
course
you
go
i
should
love
to
go
hunt
admitted
it
would
be
jolly
in
itself
and
then
i
should
hear
something
about
douglas
and
all
he
ever
tells
me
about
himself
might
be
put
on
a
field
postcard
if
the
babies
are
quite
well
norah
do
you
think
you
would
mind
taking
charge
norah
laughed
she
had
occasionally
come
to
sleep
at
the
cottage
during
a
brief
absence
on
hunt
part
and
liked
nothing
better
i
should
love
to
come
she
said
but
you
better
not
put
it
that
way
or
eva
will
be
dreadfully
injured
i
do
to
eva
smiled
hunt
she
thinks
you
come
over
in
case
she
should
need
any
one
to
run
an
errand
and
therefore
permits
herself
to
adore
you
in
fact
she
told
me
yesterday
that
for
a
young
lady
you
had
an
uncommon
amount
of
sense
jim
would
have
said
that
was
as
good
as
a
diploma
norah
said
laughing
i
rather
think
so
myself
hunt
answered
what
about
wally
norah
have
you
heard
lately
yesterday
norah
replied
he
decorated
his
letter
with
beautiful
people
using
so
i
suppose
he
is
near
ypres
he
says
very
fit
but
the
fighting
seems
very
stiff
i
not
happy
about
wally
do
you
think
he
is
well
i
do
think
his
mind
is
well
said
norah
he
was
better
here
before
he
went
back
but
now
that
he
is
out
again
i
believe
he
just
ca
bear
being
without
jim
he
ca
think
of
him
happily
as
we
do
he
only
fights
his
trouble
and
hates
himself
for
being
alive
he
does
say
so
in
words
but
when
you
know
wally
as
well
as
dad
and
i
do
you
can
tell
form
his
letters
he
used
to
write
such
cheery
funny
letters
and
now
he
deliberately
tries
to
be
funny
and
pretty
terrible
she
paused
and
suddenly
a
little
sob
came
hunt
stroked
her
hand
saying
nothing
do
you
know
norah
said
presently
i
think
we
have
lost
wally
more
than
jim
jim
died
but
the
real
jim
is
ever
close
in
our
hearts
and
we
never
let
him
go
and
we
can
talk
and
laugh
about
him
just
as
if
he
was
here
but
the
real
wally
seems
to
have
died
altogether
and
we
only
the
shell
left
something
in
him
died
when
he
saw
jim
killed
hunt
do
you
think
he
ever
be
better
i
think
he
will
hunt
said
he
is
too
fine
and
plucky
to
be
always
like
this
you
have
to
remember
that
he
is
only
a
boy
and
that
he
had
the
most
terrible
shock
that
could
come
to
him
it
must
take
time
to
recover
i
know
norah
said
i
tried
to
think
like
that
but
it
hurts
so
that
one
ca
help
him
we
would
do
anything
to
make
him
feel
better
and
you
will
in
time
remember
you
and
your
father
are
more
to
him
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
make
him
feel
you
want
him
i
think
nothing
else
can
help
him
so
much
hunt
eyes
were
full
of
tears
he
was
such
a
merry
lad
it
breaks
one
heart
to
think
of
him
as
he
is
he
was
always
the
cheerfullest
person
i
ever
saw
said
norah
he
just
laughed
through
everything
i
remember
once
when
he
was
bitten
by
a
snake
and
it
was
hours
before
we
could
get
a
doctor
we
were
nearly
mad
with
anxiety
and
he
was
in
horrible
pain
with
the
tourniquet
but
he
joked
through
it
all
in
the
most
ridiculous
way
and
he
was
always
so
eager
it
the
last
thing
you
could
call
him
now
all
the
spring
has
gone
out
of
him
it
will
come
back
hunt
said
only
keep
on
trying
let
him
see
how
much
he
means
to
you
well
he
all
we
have
left
said
norah
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
it
was
a
relief
when
the
children
burst
into
the
room
they
all
went
to
the
station
two
days
later
to
see
hunt
off
for
her
excursion
michael
was
not
to
be
depended
upon
to
remain
brave
when
a
train
actually
bore
his
mother
away
so
they
did
not
wait
to
see
her
go
there
were
errands
to
be
done
in
the
village
and
norah
bundled
them
all
into
the
giving
geoffrey
the
reins
to
his
huge
delight
he
turned
his
merry
face
to
his
mother
darling
take
care
of
yourself
in
london
town
i
will
said
his
mother
mind
you
take
care
of
all
the
family
you
in
charge
you
know
geoff
rather
he
said
i
and
they
got
to
do
what
i
tell
them
have
they
and
mother
tell
the
colonel
to
send
father
home
then
you
wo
be
said
norah
do
want
to
be
if
father
comes
said
geoffrey
his
eyes
dancing
you
tell
him
wo
you
mother
indeed
i
will
she
said
now
off
you
go
do
put
the
cart
into
the
ditch
geoff
is
you
insulting
said
her
son
loftily
but
womens
understand
he
elevated
his
nose
and
then
relented
to
fling
her
kisses
as
the
pony
trotted
off
hunt
stood
at
the
station
entrance
to
watch
him
for
a
moment
sitting
very
straight
and
stiff
holding
his
whip
at
the
precise
angle
taught
by
jones
it
was
such
a
heartsome
sight
that
the
incoming
train
took
her
by
surprise
and
she
had
barely
time
to
get
her
ticket
and
rush
for
a
carriage
norah
and
her
charges
found
so
much
to
do
in
the
village
that
when
they
reached
home
it
was
time
for
michael
morning
sleep
eva
brooked
no
interference
with
her
right
of
tucking
him
up
for
this
period
of
peace
but
graciously
permitted
norah
to
inspect
the
process
and
kiss
the
rosy
cheek
peeping
from
the
blankets
then
alison
and
geoffrey
accompanied
her
to
the
house
and
visited
miss
de
lisle
in
her
kitchen
finding
her
by
a
curious
chance
just
removing
from
the
oven
a
batch
of
tiny
cakes
of
bewildering
attractions
norah
lost
them
afterwards
and
going
to
look
for
them
was
guided
by
sound
to
allenby
pantry
where
that
most
correct
of
butlers
was
found
on
his
hands
and
knees
being
fiercely
ridden
by
both
his
visitors
when
it
was
very
pleasant
to
behold
allenby
frantic
endeavours
to
get
to
his
feet
before
norah
should
discover
him
and
yet
to
avoid
upsetting
his
riders
then
they
called
upon
linton
in
his
study
but
finding
him
for
once
inaccessible
being
submerged
beneath
accounts
and
they
fell
back
upon
the
where
harry
trevor
and
bob
mcgrath
his
chum
welcomed
them
with
open
arms
and
romped
with
them
until
it
was
time
for
norah
to
take
them
home
to
dinner
awful
jolly
kids
said
harry
why
do
you
keep
them
here
for
lunch
norah
eva
would
be
terribly
hurt
said
norah
she
always
cooks
everything
they
like
best
when
hunt
is
away
quite
regardless
of
their
digestions
well
ca
they
come
back
afterwards
let
all
go
for
a
walk
somewhere
oh

pleaded
geoffrey
could
we
go
to
the
river
norah
yes
of
course
said
norah
will
it
be
too
far
for
alison
though
not
it
she
walked
there
with
father
when
he
was
home
last
time
do
let
then
we
must
hurry
said
norah
come

or

they
found
eva
slightly
truculent
i
was
wonderin

she
drew
alison
high
chair
to
the
table
while
eva
departing
to
the
kitchen
relieved
her
feelings
with
a
burst
of
song
they
spent
a
merry
afternoon
at
the
river
a
little
stream
which
went
gurgling
over
pebbly
shallows
widening
now
and
then
into
a
broad
pool
or
hurrying
over
miniature
rapids
where
brown
trout
lurked
harry
and
bob
like
most
australian
soldiers
in
england
were
themselves
only
children
when
they
had
the
chance
of
playing
with
babies
they
romped
in
the
grass
with
them
swung
them
on
boughs
or
skimmed
stones
across
placid
pools
until
the
sun
grew
low
in
the
west
and
they
came
back
across
the
park
norah
wheeled
michael
in
a
tiny
car
bob
carried
alison
and
presently
geoffrey
admitted
that
his
legs
were
tired
and
was
glad
to
ride
home
astride
harry
broad
shoulders
linton
came
out
to
meet
them
and
they
all
went
back
to
the
cottage
where
eva
had
tea
ready
and
was
slightly
aggrieved
because
her
scones
had
cooled
now
you
must
all
go
home
norah
told
her
after
tea
it
late
and
i
have
to
bath

harry
asked
you

norah
said
geoff

geoffrey
said

yes
of
course
alison
darling
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
any
more
cakes
i
always
has
when
mother
is
at
home
said
alison
firmly
annexing
a
chocolate
cake
and
digging
her
little
white
teeth
into
it
in
the
hope
of
averting
any
further
argument
michael
does
want
more
he
had
geoff
geoff
but
did
geoff
eat
any
geoff
silly
said
his
sister
fancy
not
bein
hungry
when
there
was
cakes
i
hope
he
did
get
too
tired
norah
said
to
herself
anxiously
i
hurry
up
and
get
them
all
to
bed
she
bathed
michael
and
alison
with
eva
in
attendance
and
tucked
them
up
they
were
very
sleepy
too
sleepy
to
be
troubled
that
mother
was
not
there
to
kiss
them
good
night
indeed
as
norah
bent
over
michael
he
thought
she
was
his
mother
and
murmured
in
the
dusk
in
a
little
contented
voice
norah
put
her
cheek
down
to
the
one
for
a
moment
and
then
hurried
out
geoff
where
are
you
geoff
i
here
said
geoffrey
from
the
back
doorstep
he
rose
and
came
towards
her
slowly
something
in
his
face
made
her
vaguely
uneasy
ready
for
bed
old
chap
she
asked
come
on
are
you
tired
my
legs
are
tired
geoffrey
said
and
my
head
queer
it
keeps
turning
round
he
put
out
a
little
appealing
hand
and
norah
took
it
in
her
own
it
was
burning
hot
i
i
wish
mother
was
home
the
boy
said
norah
sat
down
and
took
him
on
her
knee
he
put
his
head
against
her
you
must
just
let
old
norah
look
after
you
until
mother
comes
back
she
said
gently
the
memory
of
the
fever
in
the
village
came
to
her
and
she
turned
sick
with
fear
for
a
moment
she
thought
desperately
of
what
she
must
do
both
for
geoffrey
and
for
the
other
children
i
wo
bath
master
geoff
he
is
tired
she
said
to
eva
she
carried
the
little
fellow
into
his
room
and
slipped
off
his
clothes
he
turned
in
the
cool
sheets
thankfully
lie
still
old
man
i
be
back
in
a
moment
norah
said
she
went
out
and
called
to
eva
reflecting
with
relief
that
the
girl
hard
cockney
sense
was
not
likely
to
fail
her
eva
she
said
i
afraid
master
geoff
is
you
know
there
is
fever
in
the
village
and
i
think
he
has
it
i
must
go
near
any
one
because
i
been
looking
after
him
run
over
to
the
house
and
tell
linton
i
would
like
him
to
come
over
as
quickly
as
possible
do
frighten
him
said
eva
i
wo
be
a
tick
her
flying
feet
thudded
across
the
grass
as
norah
went
back
to
the
room
where
geoffrey
was
already
sleeping
heavily
she
looked
down
at
the
little
face
flushed
and
dry
in
her
heart
an
agony
of
dread
for
the
mother
away
at
her
party
in
london
then
she
went
outside
to
wait
for
her
father
he
came
quickly
accompanied
by
miss
de
lisle
and
harry
trevor
i
telephoned
for
the
doctor
directly
i
got
your
message
he
said
he
be
up
in
a
few
minutes
thank
goodness
said
norah
of
course
it
may
not
be
the
fever
but
it
something
queer
the
little
chap
was
all
right
down
at
the
river
harry
said
only
he
kept
going
he
such
a
plucky
kid
but
he
sat
jolly
quiet
on
me
coming
home
i
knew
he
was
quiet
i
just
thought
he
was
a
bit
tired
norah
said
i
say
daddy
what
about
the
other
children
what
about
you
he
asked
his
voice
was
hard
with
anxiety
me
said
norah
staring
why
of
course
i
must
stay
with
him
dad
he
in
my
charge
yes
i
suppose
you
must
said
david
linton
heavily
we
find
out
from
the
doctor
what
precautions
can
be
taken
oh
i
be
all
right
norah
said
but
alison
and
michael
stay
here
no
of
course
not
well
they
must
only
come
to
us
but
the
tired
people
norah
asked
miss
de
lisle
interposed
there
are
hardly
any
now
and
two
of
the
boys
go
away
she
said
the
south
wing
could
be
kept
entirely
for
the
children
could
it
linton
katty
could
look
after
them
there
they
are
fond
of
her
that
excellent
said
linton
i
really
think
the
risk
to
the
house
would
be
much
any
of
the
tired
people
who
were
worried
would
simply
have
to
go
away
but
the
children
would
not
come
near
any
of
them
and
please
goodness
they
wo
develop
fever
at
all
then
i
go
back
and
have
a
room
prepared
miss
de
lisle
said
and
then
i
get
you
harry
to
help
me
bundle
them
up
and
carry
them
over
we
must
leave
them
in
this
place
a
minute
longer
than
we
can
help
that
lovely
fat
michael
murmured
miss
de
lisle
incoherently
she
hurried
away
there
was
a
hum
of
an
approaching
motor
presently
and
the
car
came
up
the
drive
hall
a
and
man
looked
over
geoffrey
quickly
and
nodded
to
himself
as
he
tucked
his
thermometer
under
the
boy
arm
geoffrey
scarcely
stirred
in
his
heavy
sleep
fever
of
course
said
the
doctor
presently
out
in
the
hall
no
i
ca
say
yet
whether
he
be
bad
or
not
miss
norah
we
do
our
best
not
to
let
him
be
bad
hunt
away
is
she
well
i
send
you
up
a
nurse
luckily
i
a
good
one
free
and
she
will
bring
medicines
and
will
know
all
i
want
done
he
nodded
approval
of
their
plans
for
alison
and
michael
linton
accompanied
him
to
his
car
get
your
daughter
away
as
soon
as
you
can
the
doctor
said
it
a
beastly
species
of
fever
i
like
to
hang
those
tinkers
the
child
in
the
village
died
this
afternoon
you
do
say
so
linton
exclaimed
yes
very
bad
case
from
the
first
fine
boy
too
but
they
call
me
in
time
well
this
village
had
forgotten
all
about
fever
he
jumped
into
the
car
i
be
up
in
the
morning
he
said
and
whirred
off
into
the
darkness
alison
and
michael
enormously
amused
at
what
they
took
to
be
a
new
game
were
presently
bundled
up
in
blankets
and
carried
across
to
homewood
and
soon
a
cab
trundled
up
with
a
brisk
nurse
who
at
once
took
command
in
geoffrey
room
i
do
think
you
should
stay
she
said
to
norah
the
maid
and
i
can
do
everything
for
him
and
his
mother
will
be
home
a
good
hot
bath
with
some
disinfectant
in
it
here
then
leave
all
your
clothes
here
that
you
worn
near
the
patient
and
run
home
in
fresh
things
no
risk
for
you
then
i
could
leave
geoff
norah
said
of
course
i
wo
interfere
with
you
but
his
mother
left
him
to
me
while
she
was
away
and
he
might
ask
for
me
well
it
only
for
your
own
sake
i
was
advising
you
said
the
nurse
what
do
you
think
mr
linton
i
think
she
ought
to
stay
said
david
linton
shortly
with
fear
tugging
at
his
heart
as
he
spoke
just
make
her
take
precautions
if
there
are
any
but
the
child
comes
first
he
was
left
in
our
care
he
went
away
soon
holding
norah
very
tightly
to
him
for
a
moment
and
then
the
nurse
sent
norah
to
bed
there
nothing
for
you
to
do
she
said
i
shall
have
a
sleep
near
the
patient
but
you
call
me
if
he
wants
me
yes
i
promise
now
be
off
with
you
at
the
moment
norah
did
not
feel
as
though
she
could
possibly
sleep
but
very
soon
her
eyes
grew
heavy
and
she
dozed
off
to
dream
as
she
often
dreamed
that
she
and
jim
were
riding
over
the
far
plain
at
billabong
bringing
in
a
mob
of
wild
young
bullocks
the
cattle
had
never
learned
to
drive
and
broke
back
constantly
towards
the
shelter
of
the
timber
behind
them
there
was
one
big
red
beast
in
particular
that
would
not
go
quietly
she
had
half
a
dozen
gallops
after
him
in
her
dream
with
bosun
under
her
swinging
and
turning
with
every
movement
of
the
bullocks
and
finally
heading
him
wheeling
him
and
galloping
him
back
to
the
mob
then
another
broke
away
and
jim
shouted
to
her
across
the
paddock
norah
norah
she
woke
with
a
start
a
voice
was
calling
her
name
hoarsely
she
groped
for
her
and
slippers
and
ran
to
geoffrey
room
the
nurse
also
in
her
was
bending
over
the
bed
you
quick
she
said
approvingly
he
only
called
you
once
take
this
now
sonnie
norah
she
bent
down
to
him
taking
the
hot
hand
i
here
geoff
old
man
take
your
medicine
all
right
said
geoffrey
he
gulped
it
down
obediently
and
lay
back
will
mother
come
very
soon
now
norah
said
you
know
she
had
to
be
in
london
just
for
one
night
she
be
back
it
nearly
now
the
nurse
said
not
far
off
morning
that
nice
the
child
said
stay
with
me
norah
of
course
i
will
old
man
just
shut
your
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
i
wo
go
away
she
knelt
by
his
bed
patting
him
gently
until
his
deep
breaths
told
that
sleep
had
come
to
him
again
the
nurse
touched
her
shoulder
and
pointed
to
the
door
she
got
up
softly
and
went
out
looking
through
her
open
window
at
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
in
the
east
her
dream
was
still
vivid
in
her
mind
even
over
her
anxiety
for
the
child
in
her
care
came
the
thought
of
it
and
the
feeling
that
jim
was
very
near
now
jim
she
whispered
gazing
at
the
brightening
sky
in
germany
at
that
moment
two
hunted
men
were
facing
dawn
running
wildly
in
dread
of
the
coming
daylight
but
of
that
norah
knew
nothing
the
jim
she
saw
was
the
big
boy
with
whom
she
had
ridden
so
often
at
billabong
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
laughing
face
looked
at
her
from
the
rose
and
gold
of
the
eastern
sky
then
geoffrey
turned
and
called
to
her
and
she
went
to
him
swiftly
it
was
four
days
later
mother
geoffrey
voice
was
only
a
thread
of
sound
now
will
father
come
i
have
sent
for
him
little
son
he
will
come
if
he
can
that
nice
where
norah
i
here
sweetheart
norah
took
the
wasted
hand
in
hers
holding
it
gently
try
to
go
to
sleep
do
go
away
geoffrey
murmured
i
awful
sleepy
he
half
turned
nestling
his
head
into
his
mother
arm
across
the
bed
the
mother
haggard
eyes
met
norah
but
hope
had
almost
died
from
them
if
he
lives
through
the
night
there
a
chance
the
doctor
said
to
david
linton
but
he
very
weak
poor
little
chap
an
awful
pity
such
a
jolly
kid
too
and
all
through
two
abominable
families
of
tinkers
however
there
are
no
fresh
cases
can
you
do
nothing
more
for
geoffrey
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
done
all
that
can
be
done
if
his
strength
holds
out
there
is
a
bare
chance
would
it
be
any
good
to
get
in
another
nurse
linton
asked
i
afraid
of
the
mother
and
norah
breaking
down
if
they
do
we
shall
have
to
get
some
one
else
the
doctor
answered
but
they
would
leave
him
neither
of
them
has
had
any
sleep
to
speak
of
since
the
boy
was
taken
norah
is
as
bad
as
hunt
the
nurse
says
that
even
if
they
are
asleep
they
hear
geoffrey
if
he
whispers
i
come
again
after
a
while
mr
linton
he
hurried
away
and
david
linton
went
softly
into
the
little
thatched
cottage
dusk
was
stealing
into
geoffrey
room
the
blind
fluttered
gently
in
the
evening
breeze
hunt
was
standing
by
the
window
looking
down
at
the
boy
who
lay
sleeping
one
hand
in
that
of
norah
who
knelt
by
the
bed
she
smiled
up
at
her
father
hunt
came
softly
across
the
room
and
drew
him
out
into
the
passage
he
may
be
better
if
he
sleeps
she
said
he
has
hardly
had
any
real
sleep
since
he
was
taken
poor
little
man
david
linton
voice
was
very
gentle
putting
up
a
good
fight
mrs
hunt
oh
he
so
good
the
mother
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
does
everything
we
tell
him
you
know
he
fought
us
a
bit
at
first
and
then
we
told
him
he
was
on
parade
and
we
were
the
officers
and
he
has
done
everything
in
since
i
think
he
even
tried
to
take
his
medicine
smartly
until
he
grew
too
weak
but
he
never
sleeps
more
than
a
few
moments
unless
he
can
feel
one
of
us
it
does
seem
to
matter
whether
it
norah
or
me
geoffrey
stirred
and
they
heard
norah
low
voice
go
to
sleep
old
chap
it
out
you
know
you
must
wake
up
until
reveille
has
post
gone
geoffrey
asked
feebly
oh
yes
all
the
camp
is
going
to
sleep
is
father
yes
now
you
must
go
to
sleep
with
him
the
whole
night
long
stay
close
geoffrey
whispered
his
weak
little
fingers
drew
her
hand
against
his
face
then
no
sound
came
but
fitful
breathing
the
dark
filled
the
little
room
presently
the
nurse
crept
in
with
a
shaded
lamp
and
touched
norah
shoulder
you
could
get
up
she
whispered
norah
shook
her
head
pointing
to
the
thin
fingers
curled
in
her
palm
i
all
right
she
murmured
back
they
came
and
went
in
the
room
from
time
to
time
the
mother
holding
her
breath
as
she
looked
down
at
the
quiet
face
the
nurse
with
her
keen
professional
gaze
after
a
while
the
doctor
stood
for
a
long
time
behind
her
not
moving
then
he
bent
down
to
her
sure
you
all
right
norah
nodded
presently
he
crept
out
and
soon
the
nurse
came
and
sat
down
near
the
window
hunt
has
gone
to
sleep
she
whispered
as
she
passed
norah
was
vaguely
thankful
for
that
but
nothing
was
very
clear
to
her
except
geoffrey
face
neither
the
slow
passing
of
the
hours
nor
her
own
cramped
position
that
gradually
became
pain
geoffrey
face
and
the
light
breathing
that
grew
harder
and
harder
to
bear
fear
came
and
knelt
beside
her
in
the
stillness
and
the
night
crept
on
chapter
xviii
the
watch
on
the
rhine
evening
was
closing
upon
a
waste
of
muddy
flats
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
no
rise
in
the
land
it
lay
level
to
the
skyline
with
here
and
there
a
glint
of
still
water
and
further
off
flat
banks
between
which
a
wide
river
flowed
sluggishly
if
you
cared
to
follow
the
river
you
came
at
length
to
stone
blockhouses
near
which
sentries
patrolled
the
banks
and
would
probably
have
turned
you
back
rudely
from
the
blockhouses
a
high
fence
of
barbed
wire
thickly
stretched
north
and
south
until
it
became
a
mere
thread
of
grey
stretching
over
the
country
there
was
something
relentless
forbidding
in
that
savage
fence
it
was
the
german
frontier
beyond
it
lay
holland
flat
and
peaceful
but
more
securely
than
a
mountain
range
between
the
two
countries
that
thin
grey
fence
barred
the
way
if
you
turned
back
from
the
sentries
and
followed
the
muddy
path
along
the
river
bank
you
were
scarcely
likely
to
meet
any
one
the
guards
in
the
blockhouses
were
under
strict
discipline
and
were
not
encouraged
to
allow
friends
to
visit
them
either
from
the
scattered
farms
or
from
the
town
of
emmerich
where
lights
were
beginning
to
glimmer
faintly
in
the
twilight
it
was
not
safe
for
them
to
disregard
regulations
since
at
any
moment
a
patrol
might
come
shooting
down
the
river
or
a
surprise
visit
be
paid
by
a
detachment
from
the
battalion
of
infantry
quartered
for
training
purposes
at
emmerich
penalties
for
lax
discipline
were
severe
the
guards
were
supposed
to
live
on
the
alert
both
by
day
and
by
night
and
the
emmerich
commandant
considered
that
the
fewer
distractions
permitted
to
the
sentries
the
more
likely
they
were
to
make
their
watch
a
thorough
one
there
had
been
too
many
escapes
of
prisoners
of
war
across
the
frontier
unpleasant
remarks
had
been
made
from
berlin
and
the
commandant
was
on
his
mettle
therefore
the
was
purposely
lonely
and
any
stray
figure
on
it
was
likely
to
attract
attention
a
mile
from
the
northern
bank
a
windmill
loomed
dark
against
the
horizon
a
round
brick
building
like
a
big
with
four
great
arms
looking
like
crossed
combs
a
rough
track
led
to
it
from
the
main
road
within
the
building
was
divided
into
several
floors
lit
by
narrow
windows
the
heavy
sails
had
plied
lazily
during
the
day
now
they
had
been
secured
and
two
men
were
coming
down
the
ladder
that
led
from
the
top
on
the
ground
floor
they
paused
looking
discontentedly
at
some
barrels
that
were
ranged
against
the
wall
loosely
covered
with
sacking
those
accursed
barrels
are
leaking
again
one
said
in
german
look
he
pointed
to
a
dark
stain
spreading
from
below
and
rudolf
told
me
he
had
caulked
them
thoroughly
rudolf
does
nothing
thoroughly
do
you
not
know
that
answered
his
companion
scornfully
if
one
stands
over
him
well
and
good
if
not
then
all
that
master
rudolf
cares
for
is
how
soon
he
may
get
back
to
his
beerhouse
well
they
must
be
seen
to
in
the
morning
it
is
too
late
to
begin
the
job
i
am
in
no
hurry
said
the
first
man
if
you
would
help
me
i
would
attend
to
them
now
all
the
stuff
may
not
be
wasted
himmel
i
am
not
going
to
begin
work
again
at
this
hour
answered
the
other
with
a
laugh
i
am
not
like
rudolf
but
i
see
no
enjoyment
in
working
overtime
it
will
be
dark
as
it
is
before
we
get
to
emmerich
come
on
my
friend
you
are
a
lazy
fellow
emil
rejoined
the
first
man
however
the
loss
is
not
ours
after
all
and
we
should
be
paid
nothing
extra
for
doing
the
work
have
you
the
key
i
do
not
forget
it
two
nights
running
returned
emil
what
luck
it
was
that
the
master
did
not
come
if
he
had
found
the
mill
open
i
should
certainly
have
paid
dearly
luck
for
you
indeed
said
his
companion
they
went
out
shutting
and
locking
the
heavy
oaken
door
behind
them
then
they
took
the
track
that
led
to
the
main
road
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
had
scarcely
died
away
when
the
sacking
over
one
of
the
barrels
became
convulsed
by
an
internal
disturbance
and
fell
to
the
floor
and
jim
linton
head
popped
up
in
the
opening
like
a
box
come
on
desmond
they
gone
at
last
he
whispered
desmond
head
came
up
cautiously
from
another
barrel
take
care
it
may
be
only
a
blind
he
warned
they
may
come
back
at
any
moment
jim
answer
was
to
wriggle
himself
out
of
his
narrow
prison
slowly
and
painfully
he
reached
the
floor
and
stood
stretching
himself
if
they
come
back
i
meet
them
with
my
hands
free
he
said
come
on
old
man
we
like
rats
in
a
trap
if
they
catch
us
in
those
beastly
tubs
at
least
out
here
we
our
knives
and
our
fists
come
out
and
get
the
stiffness
out
of
your
limbs
well
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
go
under
fighting
if
we
have
to
desmond
agreed
jim
helped
him
out
and
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
they
were
a
pair
their
clothes
hung
in
rags
about
them
they
were
barefoot
and
hatless
and
beyond
all
belief
dirty
thin
to
emaciation
their
gaunt
limbs
and
hollow
cheeks
spoke
of
terrible
privations
but
their
sunken
eyes
burned
fiercely
and
there
was
grim
purpose
in
their
set
lips
well
we
out
of
the
small
traps
but
it
seems
to
me
we
caught
pretty
securely
in
a
big
one
desmond
said
presently
how
on
earth
are
we
going
to
get
out
of
this
we
explore
jim
said
suddenly
his
eye
fell
on
a
package
lying
on
an
empty
box
and
he
sprang
towards
it
tearing
it
open
with
fingers
oh
by
jove
he
said
they
fell
upon
it
ravenously
coarse
food
left
by
one
of
the
men
whose
of
the
night
before
had
perhaps
been
too
heavy
to
leave
him
with
much
appetite
next
day
but
coarse
as
it
was
it
was
life
to
the
two
men
who
devoured
it
it
was
nearly
six
weeks
since
the
night
when
their
tunnel
had
taken
them
into
the
world
outside
the
barbed
wire
of
their
prison
six
weeks
during
which
it
had
seemed
in
desmond
phrase
as
though
they
had
escaped
from
a
small
trap
to
find
themselves
caught
within
a
big
one
they
had
been
weeks
of
dodging
and
hiding
travelling
by
night
trusting
to
map
and
compass
and
the
stars
lying
by
day
in
woods
in
ditches
under
haystacks
in
any
hole
or
corner
that
should
shelter
them
in
a
world
that
seemed
full
of
cruel
eyes
looking
ceaselessly
for
them
backwards
and
forwards
they
had
been
driven
making
a
few
miles
and
then
forced
to
retreat
for
many
thrown
out
of
their
course
often
lost
hopelessly
falling
from
one
danger
into
another
they
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
sleep
peacefully
their
food
had
been
chiefly
turnips
stolen
from
the
fields
and
eaten
raw
three
times
they
had
reached
the
frontier
only
to
be
seen
by
the
guards
fired
upon
a
bullet
had
clipped
jim
ear
and
forced
to
turn
back
as
the
only
alternative
to
capture
what
that
had
meant
no
one
but
the
men
who
endured
it
could
ever
know
each
time
swift
pursuit
had
nearly
discovered
them
they
had
once
saved
themselves
by
lying
for
a
whole
day
and
part
of
a
night
in
a
pond
with
only
their
faces
above
water
in
a
clump
of
reeds
they
had
long
abandoned
their
original
objective
the
point
they
had
aimed
at
on
the
frontier
was
far
too
strongly
guarded
and
after
two
attempts
to
get
through
they
had
given
it
up
as
hopeless
and
had
struck
towards
the
rhine
in
faint
expectation
of
finding
a
boat
and
perhaps
being
able
to
slip
through
the
sentries
they
had
reached
the
river
two
nights
before
but
only
to
realize
that
their
hope
was
vain
no
boats
were
to
be
seen
and
the
frowning
blockhouses
barred
the
way
relentlessly
so
they
had
struck
north
again
trying
to
pierce
the
frontier
and
the
night
before
had
encountered
sentries
not
men
alone
but
bloodhounds
the
guards
had
contented
themselves
with
firing
a
few
volleys
the
dogs
had
pursued
them
savagely
one
jim
had
succeeded
in
killing
with
his
knife
the
other
thrown
off
the
trail
for
a
little
by
a
stream
down
which
they
had
waded
had
tracked
them
down
until
almost
exhausted
they
had
dashed
in
through
the
open
door
of
the
old
mill
for
once
careless
as
to
any
human
beings
who
might
be
there
the
bloodhound
had
come
too
and
in
the
mill
lit
by
shafts
of
moonlight
through
the
narrow
windows
they
had
turned
to
bay
the
fight
had
not
lasted
long
they
were
quick
and
desperate
and
the
dog
had
paid
the
penalty
of
his
sins
or
of
the
sins
of
the
human
brutes
who
had
trained
him
then
they
had
looked
for
concealment
finding
none
in
the
mill
the
floors
were
bare
except
for
the
great
barrels
of
a
brown
liquid
that
they
could
not
define
well
there
nothing
for
it
jim
had
said
there
not
an
inch
of
cover
outside
and
daylight
will
soon
be
here
we
must
empty
two
of
these
things
and
get
inside
and
the
dog
desmond
had
asked
oh
we
pickle
ponto
together
they
had
managed
it
though
the
barrels
taxed
all
their
strength
to
move
the
body
of
the
bloodhound
had
been
lowered
into
the
brown
liquid
two
of
the
others
had
been
gradually
emptied
upon
the
earthen
floor
with
the
daylight
they
had
crawled
in
drawing
the
sacking
over
them
to
crouch
through
the
long
day
trembling
when
a
step
came
near
clenching
their
knives
with
a
sick
resolve
to
sell
their
freedom
dearly
it
seemed
incredible
that
they
had
not
been
discovered
and
now
the
package
of
food
was
the
last
stroke
of
good
luck
well
blessings
on
emil
or
fritz
or
ludwig
or
whoever
he
was
jim
said
eating
luxuriously
this
is
the
best
i
had
since
well
there
is
any
since
there
never
was
anything
so
good
before
never
agreed
desmond
by
george
i
thought
we
were
done
when
that
energetic
gentleman
wanted
to
begin
overhauling
the
casks
me
too
said
jim
emil
saved
us
there
good
luck
to
him
they
finished
the
last
tiny
crumb
and
stood
up
i
a
different
man
desmond
said
if
i
have
to
run
then
the
man
that
tries
to
catch
me
will
have
to
do
it
with
a
bullet
that
likely
enough
jim
said
laughing
well
come
and
see
how
we
going
to
get
out
there
seemed
little
enough
chance
as
they
searched
from
floor
to
floor
the
great
door
was
strong
enough
to
resist
ten
men
the
windows
were
only
slits
far
too
narrow
to
allow
them
to
pass
through
even
had
they
dared
risk
the
noise
of
breaking
their
thick
glass
up
and
up
they
went
their
hearts
sinking
as
their
bodies
mounted
seeing
no
possible
way
of
leaving
their
round
prison
rats
in
a
trap
said
desmond
there
nothing
for
it
but
those
beastly
barrels
again
and
to
watch
our
chance
of
settling
emil
and
his
pal
when
they
come
let
look
out
here
jim
said
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
mill
in
a
little
circular
place
barely
large
enough
for
them
to
stand
upright
a
low
door
opened
upon
a
tiny
platform
with
a
railing
from
which
the
great
sails
could
be
worked
they
were
back
now
but
the
wind
was
rising
and
they
creaked
and
strained
at
their
mooring
rope
far
below
the
silver
sheet
of
the
rhine
moved
sluggishly
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
the
blockhouses
stood
out
sharply
on
either
bank
wonder
if
they
can
see
us
as
plainly
as
we
see
them
jim
said
we
have
callers
here
presently
if
they
can
desmond
said
that
at
least
is
certain
better
come
in
jim
jim
was
looking
at
the
great
sails
and
then
at
the
rope
that
moored
them
wait
half
a
minute
he
said
he
dived
into
the
mill
and
returned
almost
instantly
with
a
small
coil
of
rope
i
noticed
this
when
we
came
up
he
said
it
did
seem
long
enough
to
be
any
use
by
itself
but
if
we
tie
it
to
this
it
might
be
long
enough
to
reach
the
ground
from
here
desmond
asked
him
in
astonishment
never
you
dreaming
jim
not
from
here
of
course
jim
said
but
from
the
end
of
the
sail
the
sail
desmond
echoed
if
we
tie
it
to
the
end
of
the
sail
rope
and
let
the
mill
go
we
can
swing
out
one
at
a
time
jim
said
bit
of
a
drop
at
the
bottom
of
course
but
i
do
think
it
would
be
too
much
if
we
wait
till
our
sail
points
straight
down
but
desmond
hesitated
the
sail
may
not
bear
any
weight
neither
may
the
rope
itself
the
ropes
seem
good
enough
they
light
but
strong
jim
said
as
for
the
sail
well
it
looks
pretty
tough
the
framework
is
iron
we
can
haul
on
it
and
test
it
a
bit
i
sooner
risk
it
than
be
caught
here
old
man
well
i
going
first
desmond
said
that
you
not
it
my
own
little
patent
idea
jim
retorted
just
you
play
fair
you
old
reprobate
look
they
keep
a
sort
of
boathook
thing
here
to
catch
the
rope
when
the
arm
is
turning
very
thoughtful
and
handy
you
easily
get
it
back
with
that
he
was
knotting
the
two
ropes
as
he
spoke
testing
them
with
all
his
strength
there
that
will
hold
he
said
now
we
let
her
go
he
untied
the
and
very
slowly
the
great
sails
began
to
revolve
they
tugged
violently
as
the
arm
bearing
the
rope
mounted
and
drew
it
back
it
creaked
and
groaned
but
the
rope
held
and
nothing
gave
way
jim
turned
his
face
to
desmond
on
the
narrow
platform
i
off
he
said
no
end
of
a
jolly
lark
is
it
hold
her
till
i
get
on
the
railing
jim
if
it
too
short
well
i
know
all
about
that
in
a
minute
said
jim
with
a
short
laugh
so
long
old
chap
i
be
waiting
below
to
catch
you
when
you
bounce
he
flung
his
legs
over
the
railing
sitting
upon
it
for
an
instant
while
he
gripped
the
rope
twining
his
legs
round
it
then
he
dropped
off
sliding
quickly
down
sick
with
suspense
desmond
leaned
over
to
watch
him
down
down
he
went
the
rose
for
a
moment
and
then
checked
as
his
weight
came
on
them
and
slowly
slowly
the
great
sail
from
which
he
dangled
came
back
until
it
pointed
straight
downwards
with
the
clinging
figure
hanging
far
below
down
until
the
man
above
could
scarcely
see
him
and
then
the
rope
released
suddenly
sprang
into
the
air
and
the
sails
mounted
revolving
as
if
to
make
up
for
lost
time
on
the
grass
below
a
figure
capered
madly
a
low
triumphant
whistle
came
up
oh
thank
god
said
desmond
he
clutched
the
boathook
and
leaned
out
finding
that
his
hands
trembled
so
that
the
sails
went
round
three
times
before
he
managed
to
catch
the
dangling
rope
then
it
was
only
a
moment
before
he
was
on
the
grass
beside
jim
they
grinned
at
each
other
you
all
right
jim
asked
oh
yes
it
was
pretty
beastly
seeing
you
go
though
it
was
only
a
drop
at
the
end
said
jim
casting
his
eye
up
at
the
creaking
sails
but
it
certainly
was
a
nasty
moment
while
one
wondered
if
the
old
affair
would
hold
i
do
believe
it
ever
was
made
in
germany
it
too
well
done
well
praise
the
pigs
we
have
got
to
tackle
those
barrels
again
desmond
said
come
along
we
try
and
find
a
hole
in
the
old
fence
they
came
out
of
the
friendly
shadow
of
the
mill
and
trotted
northwards
bending
low
as
they
ran
there
was
no
cover
on
the
flats
and
the
moonlight
was
all
too
clear
although
friendly
clouds
darkened
it
from
time
to
time
it
was
a
windy
night
with
promise
of
rain
before
morning
halt
who
goes
there
the
sharp
german
words
rang
out
suddenly
before
them
three
soldiers
seemed
to
have
risen
from
the
ground
with
levelled
rifles
jim
and
desmond
gave
a
despairing
gasp
and
turned
ducking
and
twisting
as
they
fled
bullets
whistled
past
them
are
you
hit
jim
called
no
are
you
no
there
nothing
but
the
river
they
raced
on
madly
their
bare
feet
making
no
sound
behind
them
the
pursuit
thudded
and
occasionally
a
rifle
cracked
not
so
much
in
the
hope
of
hitting
the
twisting
fugitives
as
to
warn
the
river
sentries
of
their
coming
the
germans
were
not
hurrying
there
was
no
escape
they
knew
father
rhine
and
his
guardians
would
take
care
of
their
quarry
jim
jogged
up
beside
desmond
we
just
a
chance
he
said
if
we
ever
get
to
the
river
you
can
swim
under
water
oh
yes
then
keep
as
close
to
the
bank
as
you
can
the
shots
may
go
over
you
we
get
as
near
the
blockhouses
as
we
dare
before
we
dive
keep
close
he
was
the
better
runner
and
he
drew
ahead
desmond
hard
at
his
heels
the
broad
river
gleamed
in
front
there
were
men
with
rifles
silhouetted
against
its
silver
then
a
merciful
drifted
across
the
moon
and
the
shots
whistled
harmlessly
in
the
sudden
darkness
jim
felt
the
edge
of
the
bank
under
his
feet
dive
he
called
softly
he
went
in
gently
and
desmond
followed
with
a
splash
the
sluggish
water
was
like
velvet
the
tide
took
them
gently
on
while
they
swam
madly
below
the
surface
shouts
ran
up
and
down
the
banks
searchlights
from
the
blockhouses
lit
the
river
and
the
water
was
churned
under
a
hail
of
bullets
with
every
guard
letting
off
his
rifle
into
the
stream
in
the
hope
of
hitting
something
the
bombardment
lasted
for
five
minutes
and
then
the
officer
in
command
gave
the
signal
to
cease
fire
the
pity
is
he
observed
that
we
never
get
the
bodies
the
current
sees
to
that
but
the
swine
will
hardly
float
back
to
their
england
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
being
settled
suppose
we
return
to
supper
it
might
have
hindered
the
worthy
captain
enjoyment
had
he
been
able
to
see
a
fifty
yards
below
the
frontier
where
two
dripping
men
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
and
cried
and
wrung
each
other
hands
and
in
general
behaved
like
people
bereft
of
reason
have
got
a
scratch
have
you
you
old
blighter
asked
jim
ecstatically
not
one
rotten
practice
was
it
sure
you
all
right
rather
do
you
realize
you
in
holland
do
you
realize
that
no
beastly
hun
can
come
up
out
of
nowhere
and
take
at
you
it
not
their
i
minded
so
much
said
jim
but
to
go
back
to
a
well
shooting
would
be
a
joke
to
that
oh
by
jove
is
it
gorgeous
they
pumped
hands
again
now
look
here
we
got
to
be
sober
desmond
said
presently
holland
is
all
very
well
i
heard
it
a
nice
place
for
skating
but
neither
of
us
has
any
wish
to
get
interned
here
rather
not
said
jim
i
want
to
go
home
and
get
into
uniform
again
and
go
hunting
for
huns
same
here
said
desmond
therefore
we
will
sneak
along
this
river
until
we
find
a
boat
go
steady
now
young
linton
and
do
turn
hand
springs
within
the
dutch
frontier
the
rhine
breaks
up
into
a
delta
of
navigable
streams
on
which
little
ply
perpetually
and
the
skipper
of
a
dutch
will
do
anything
for
money
a
couple
of
hours
hard
walking
brought
jim
and
desmond
to
a
village
with
a
little
pier
near
which
half
a
dozen
boats
were
moored
a
light
showed
in
a
and
they
went
softly
on
deck
and
found
their
way
below
into
a
tiny
and
malodorous
cabin
a
stout
man
sprang
to
his
feet
at
sight
of
the
dripping
scarecrows
who
invaded
his
privacy
south
africa
had
taught
desmond
sufficient
dutch
to
enable
him
to
make
himself
intelligible
he
explained
the
position
briefly
to
the
mariner
and
they
talked
at
length
wants
a
stiff
figure
he
said
finally
turning
to
jim
but
he
says
do
he
get
us
some
clothes
and
drop
down
the
river
with
us
to
rotterdam
and
find
a
skipper
who
get
us
across
to
harwich
the
german
navy
permitting
of
course
the
german
navy
said
jim
scornfully
but
they
asleep
he
yawned
hugely
i
going
to
sleep
too
if
i
have
to
camp
on
the
gentleman
table
tell
him
to
call
me
when
it
time
to
change
for
blighty
chapter
xix
reveille
it
was
not
yet
dawn
when
david
linton
fully
dressed
came
into
the
cottage
garden
the
door
stood
open
and
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
crept
into
the
house
eva
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
passage
with
her
head
in
her
hands
she
looked
up
with
a
start
as
the
big
man
came
in
and
scrambled
to
her
feet
a
queer
dishevelled
figure
with
her
tousled
head
and
crumpled
cap
and
apron
a
wave
of
dismay
swept
over
linton
is
he
he
whispered
and
stopped
the
girl
beckoned
him
into
the
never
stirred
all
night
she
whispered
i
dunno
if
dead
i
never
see
any
one
lie
so
still
the
nurse
would
sit
there
like
a
wooden
image
if
was
dead
would
she
sir
surely
not
said
david
linton
where
is
miss
norah
kneelin
alongside
of
same
like
she
was
when
you
was
here
she
ai
never
stirred
neither
an
i
bet
a
dollar
she
must
be
stiff
and
mrs
hunt
she
in
there
wiv
she
a
little
sleep
not
much
no
said
one
word
in
this
all
night
why
did
you
go
to
bed
david
linton
said
looking
down
at
the
pinched
old
face
and
the
stooping
shoulders
he
had
never
noticed
eva
very
much
now
he
felt
a
sudden
wave
of
pity
for
the
little
london
servant
she
loved
geoffrey
too
in
her
queer
way
not
me
said
eva
defiantly
and
very
near
dyin
i
been
boilin
the
kettle
every
hour
or
so
but
none
of
came
out
for
tea
will
a
cup
sir
a
refusal
was
on
his
lips
but
he
changed
his
mind
thank
you
he
said
gently
and
have
one
yourself
eva
my
word
i
be
glad
of
it
she
said
it
bitter
cold
out
there
she
off
to
the
kitchen
linton
stood
hesitating
for
a
moment
and
then
went
along
the
passage
a
screen
blocked
geoffrey
doorway
and
he
peeped
over
it
as
he
did
so
hunt
moved
to
the
end
of
the
bed
geoffrey
lay
exactly
as
he
had
been
on
the
night
before
so
utterly
still
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
he
were
alive
or
dead
norah
crouched
beside
him
her
hand
still
against
his
face
then
very
slowly
geoffrey
turned
and
opened
his
eyes
mother
he
said
mother
i
so
thirsty
hunt
was
beside
him
as
his
eyelids
had
lifted
the
nurse
moving
swiftly
handed
her
a
little
cup
drink
this
sweetheart
the
mother
raised
his
head
and
geoffrey
drank
eagerly
that
awful
nice
he
said
may
i
have
some
more
they
gave
him
more
and
put
him
back
on
the
pillow
he
looked
at
norah
who
knelt
by
him
silently
wake
up
old
norah
it
reveille
he
said
she
smiled
at
him
and
put
her
face
on
his
but
she
did
not
stir
suddenly
the
nurse
saw
linton
and
beckoned
to
him
carry
her
she
ca
move
norah
felt
her
father
arm
about
her
hold
round
my
neck
dear
he
said
the
nurse
was
at
her
other
side
they
raised
her
slowly
while
she
clenched
her
teeth
to
keep
back
any
sound
that
should
tell
of
the
agony
of
moving
still
smiling
with
her
eyes
on
geoffrey
sleepy
face
then
suddenly
she
grew
limp
in
her
father
arm
fainted
murmured
the
nurse
and
a
very
good
thing
she
put
her
arm
round
her
and
they
carried
her
out
between
them
and
put
her
on
a
sofa
i
must
go
back
to
geoffrey
the
nurse
said
rub
her
rub
her
knees
hard
before
she
comes
to
it
going
to
hurt
her
poor
child
she
hurried
away
geoffrey
was
lying
quietly
his
mother
head
close
to
him
the
nurse
put
her
hand
on
his
brow
nice
and
cool
she
said
you
a
very
good
boy
geoff
think
about
some
breakfast
for
you
presently
hunt
raised
her
white
face
and
the
nurse
professional
calmness
wavered
a
little
she
patted
her
shoulder
there
there
my
dear
she
said
he
going
to
do
very
well
do
you
worry
he
be
teaching
me
to
ride
that
pony
before
we
know
where
we
are
she
busied
herself
about
the
boy
with
deft
touches
now
just
keep
very
quiet
put
mother
to
sleep
if
you
like
for
she
a
tired
old
mother
she
hastened
back
to
norah
is
she
all
right
david
linton
voice
was
sharp
with
anxiety
she
has
never
moved
the
best
thing
for
her
said
the
nurse
putting
him
aside
and
beginning
to
massage
this
new
patient
if
i
can
rub
some
of
the
stiffness
away
before
she
becomes
conscious
it
will
save
her
a
lot
run
away
there
a
dear
man
and
tell
that
poor
soul
in
the
kitchen
that
the
child
is
all
right
he
will
live
rather
that
sleep
has
taken
every
trace
of
the
fever
away
weak
of
course
but
we
can
deal
with
that
when
there
no
temperature
tell
eva
to
make
tea
lots
of
it
we
all
want
it
thus
it
was
that
presently
might
have
been
seen
the
astounding
spectacle
of
a
grizzled
australian
squatter
and
a
little
cockney
holding
each
other
hands
in
a
back
kitchen
i
knew
it
was
orright
when
i
you
comin
down
the
said
eva
tearfully
no
one
that
sort
of
a
step
in
this
since
master
geoff
went
sick
the
dear
lamb
wo
it
be
to
see
muddy
on
me
clean
floor
agin
an
him

for
grub
i
tea
in
a
jiffy
sir
an
please
me
for
ketchin
old
of
you
like
that
but
bust
if
i
on
to
somefink
geoffrey
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
presently
and
hunt
came
to
norah
who
was
conscious
and
extremely
stiff
but
otherwise
too
happy
to
care
for
aches
and
pains
they
did
not
speak
at
first
those
two
had
gone
down
to
the
borderland
of
death
to
bring
back
little
wandering
feet
only
they
looked
at
each
other
and
clung
together
still
trembling
though
only
the
shadow
of
fear
remained
after
that
geoffrey
mended
rapidly
and
having
been
saintlike
when
very
ill
became
just
an
ordinary
little
sinner
in
his
convalescence
and
taxed
every
one
patience
to
keep
him
amused
alison
and
michael
who
were
anxiously
watched
for
developing
symptoms
refused
to
develop
anything
at
all
remaining
in
the
rudest
health
so
that
they
were
presently
given
the
run
of
all
homewood
and
assisted
greatly
in
preventing
any
of
the
tired
people
from
feeling
dull
norah
remained
at
the
cottage
which
was
placed
strictly
in
quarantine
and
played
with
geoffrey
through
the
slow
days
of
weakness
that
the
little
fellow
found
so
hard
to
understand
aids
to
convalescence
came
from
every
quarter
major
hunt
unable
to
leave
france
sent
parcels
of
such
toys
and
books
as
could
still
be
bought
in
towns
wally
who
had
been
given
four
days
leave
in
paris
which
bored
him
to
death
sent
truly
amazing
packages
and
the
tired
people
vied
with
david
linton
in
ransacking
london
for
gifts
for
the
geoffrey
thought
them
all
very
kind
and
would
have
given
everything
for
one
hour
on
brecon
beside
linton
you
be
able
to
ride
soon
old
chap
norah
said
on
his
first
afternoon
out
of
bed
will
i
the
boy
looked
scornfully
at
his
thin
legs
look
at
them
they
like
silly
sticks
yes
but
brecon
wo
mind
that
and
they
get
quite
fat
again
well
not
fat
as
geoffrey
showed
symptoms
of
horror
but
hard
and
fit
like
they
were
before
quite
useful
i
do
hope
so
geoffrey
said
i
want
them
to
be
all
right
before
father
comes
and
wally
will
wally
come
soon
do
you
think
i
afraid
not
you
see
he
has
been
to
paris
there
hardly
any
leave
to
england
now
leave
will
be
open
by
christmas
geoffrey
suggested
hopefully
would
it
be
a
lovely
christmas
if
father
and
wally
both
came
would
it
just
norah
smiled
at
him
but
the
smile
faded
in
a
moment
and
she
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
christmas
had
always
been
such
a
perfect
time
in
their
lives
she
looked
back
to
years
when
it
had
always
meant
a
season
of
welcoming
jim
back
when
every
day
for
weeks
beforehand
had
been
gay
with
preparations
for
his
return
from
school
jim
would
arrive
with
his
trunks
bulging
with
surprises
for
christmas
morning
wally
would
be
with
him
both
keen
and
eager
for
every
detail
in
the
life
of
the
homestead
just
as
ready
to
work
as
to
play
all
billabong
from
the
chinese
gardener
to
linton
hummed
with
the
joy
of
their
coming
now
for
the
first
time
christmas
would
bring
them
nothing
of
jim
she
felt
suddenly
old
and
tired
and
the
feeling
grew
in
the
weeks
that
followed
while
geoffrey
gradually
came
back
to
strength
and
merriment
and
the
cottage
after
a
strenuous
period
of
disinfecting
emerged
from
the
ban
of
quarantine
alison
and
michael
had
a
rapturous
reunion
with
their
mother
and
geoffrey
and
homewood
grew
strangely
quiet
without
the
patter
of
their
feet
norah
returned
to
her
post
as
housekeeper
to
find
little
to
do
the
house
seemed
to
run
on
oiled
wheels
and
miss
de
lisle
and
the
servants
united
in
trying
to
save
her
trouble
i
dunno
is
it
the
fever
she
have
on
her
said
katty
in
the
kitchen
one
evening
she
that
quiet
and
you
would
know
her
for
the
same
gerrl
oh
there
no
fear
of
fever
now
said
miss
de
lisle
well
she
is
not
right
is
it
fretting
she
is
after
masther
jim
she
was
that
brave
at
first
you
not
have
said
there
was
any
one
dead
at
all
i
think
she
tired
out
said
miss
de
lisle
she
has
been
under
great
strain
ever
since
the
news
of
jim
came
and
she
is
only
a
child
she
ca
go
through
all
that
and
finish
up
by
nursing
a
fever
patient
and
then
avoid
paying
for
it
she
can
not
indeed
said
katty
why
would
the
masther
take
her
away
for
a
change
indeed
it
himself
looks
bad
enough
these
times
as
well
we
have
the
two
of
them
ill
on
us
if
they
do
take
care
they
might
go
said
miss
de
lisle
thoughtfully
i
suggest
it
to
mr
linton
david
linton
indeed
would
have
done
anything
to
bring
back
the
colour
to
norah
cheeks
and
the
light
into
her
eyes
but
when
he
suggested
going
away
she
shrank
from
it
pitifully
ah
no
daddy
i
quite
well
truly
indeed
you
not
he
said
look
at
the
way
you
never
eat
anything
oh
i
eat
ever
so
much
said
norah
eagerly
only
do
go
away
we
have
work
here
and
we
would
know
what
to
do
with
ourselves
anywhere
else
perhaps
some
time
when
wally
comes
home
if
he
cares
to
go
we
might
think
about
it
but
not
now
daddy
she
hesitated
unless
of
course
you
want
to
very
much
not
unless
you
do
he
said
only
get
well
my
girl
i
quite
all
right
protested
norah
it
was
only
geoff
illness
that
made
me
a
bit
slack
and
we
had
a
busy
summer
have
we
i
think
our
little
has
turned
out
too
badly
dad
not
too
badly
at
all
if
it
has
been
too
much
for
my
housekeeper
he
said
looking
at
her
keenly
remember
i
wo
have
her
knocked
up
i
wo
be
daddy
dear
i
promise
norah
said
she
made
a
brave
effort
to
keep
his
mind
at
ease
as
the
days
went
on
riding
and
walking
with
him
forcing
herself
to
sing
as
she
went
about
the
house
she
had
her
reward
in
the
look
in
the
silent
man
eyes
when
he
first
heard
a
song
on
her
lips
and
entering
with
a
good
imitation
of
her
old
energy
into
the
plans
for
the
next
year
on
the
farm
but
it
was
all
imitation
and
in
his
heart
david
linton
knew
it
the
old
norah
was
gone
he
could
only
pity
her
with
all
his
big
heart
and
help
her
in
her
struggle
knowing
well
that
it
was
for
his
sake
in
his
mind
he
began
to
plan
their
return
to
australia
in
the
hope
that
billabong
would
prove
a
tonic
to
her
tired
mind
and
body
and
yet
how
could
they
face
billabong
without
jim
he
came
out
on
the
terrace
one
evening
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
norah
he
said
i
good
news
for
you
wally
is
coming
home
is
he
dad
on
leave
well
he
has
been
wounded
but
not
seriously
they
have
been
nursing
him
in
a
hospital
at
boulogne
and
he
writes
that
he
is
better
but
he
is
to
have
a
fortnight
leave
it
will
be
lovely
to
have
him
norah
said
may
i
see
the
letter
dad
of
course
he
gave
it
to
her
poor
old
wally
we
must
give
him
a
good
time
norah
it
a
pity
harry
leave
did
happen
at
the
same
time
said
norah
however
phil
will
be
a
mate
for
him
they
like
each
other
awfully
yes
agreed
her
father
still
i
do
think
wally
wants
any
other
mate
when
you
are
about
they
were
always
astonishingly
good
in
the
way
they
overlooked
my
bad
taste
in
being
a
girl
said
norah
with
a
laugh
she
was
running
her
eye
over
the
letter
oh
hit
in
the
shoulder
i
do
hope
it
was
a
very
painful
wound
poor
old
boy
i
wonder
will
he
be
able
to
ride
dad
he
says
he
very
well
but
then
he
would
linton
said
since
we
first
knew
him
wally
would
never
admit
so
much
as
a
if
he
could
possibly
avoid
it
i
expect
he
ride
if
it
humanly
possible
allenby
came
out
hawkins
would
like
to
see
you
sir
very
well
said
his
master
by
the
way
allenby
wally
is
coming
back
on
leave
the
butler
face
brightened
is
he
indeed
sir
that
good
news
yes
he
has
been
wounded
but
he
all
right
miss
de
lisle
will
certainly
invent
a
new
dish
in
his
honour
sir
said
allenby
laughing
is
he
coming
soon
this
week
he
says
well
i
must
keep
hawkins
waiting
he
went
into
the
house
with
allenby
at
his
heels
it
was
evident
that
the
kitchen
would
hear
the
news
as
quickly
as
the
could
get
there
norah
read
the
letter
over
again
slowly
and
folded
it
up
then
she
turned
from
the
house
and
went
slowly
across
the
lawn
at
the
sweep
of
the
drive
there
was
a
path
that
made
a
short
cut
across
the
park
to
a
stile
and
her
feet
turned
into
it
the
dull
apathy
that
had
clogged
her
brain
for
weeks
was
suddenly
gone
she
felt
no
pleasure
in
the
prospect
that
would
once
have
been
so
joyful
of
seeing
wally
instead
her
whole
being
was
seething
with
a
wild
revolt
wally
coming
had
always
meant
jim
now
he
would
come
alone
and
jim
could
never
come
again
it
is
fair
she
said
to
herself
over
and
over
it
is
fair
she
came
to
the
stile
and
paused
looking
over
it
into
a
quiet
lane
all
her
passionate
hunger
for
jim
rose
within
her
choking
her
she
had
kept
him
close
to
her
at
first
lately
he
had
slipped
away
so
that
she
had
no
longer
the
dear
comfort
of
his
unseen
presence
that
had
helped
her
through
the
summer
and
she
wanted
him
wanted
him
her
tired
mind
and
body
cried
for
him
always
chum
and
mate
and
brother
in
one
she
put
her
head
down
on
the
railing
with
a
dry
sob
a
quick
step
brushed
through
the
crisp
leaves
carpeting
the
lane
she
looked
up
a
man
in
rough
clothes
was
coming
towards
her
norah
drew
back
wishing
she
had
brought
the
dogs
with
her
the
place
was
lonely
and
the
evening
was
closing
in
she
turned
to
go
and
as
she
did
so
the
man
broke
into
a
clear
whistle
that
made
her
pause
catching
her
breath
it
was
the
marching
tune
of
jim
regiment
but
beyond
the
tune
itself
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
whistle
something
that
brought
her
back
to
the
stile
panting
catching
at
the
rail
with
her
hands
was
there
any
one
else
in
the
world
with
that
whistle
with
that
long
free
stride
he
came
nearer
and
saw
her
for
the
first
time
a
girl
who
stood
and
stared
at
him
with
eyes
that
dared
not
believe
with
lips
that
tried
to
speak
his
name
and
could
not
it
was
jim
who
sobbed
as
he
spoke
norah
norah
he
flung
himself
over
the
stile
and
caught
her
to
him
old
mate
he
said
dear
little
old
mate
they
clung
together
like
children
presently
norah
put
up
her
hand
feeling
the
rough
serge
of
his
coat
it
is
a
dream
she
said
tell
me
it
is
let
me
wake
up
jim
laugh
was
very
tender
i
no
dream
he
said
all
these
months
have
been
the
dream
and
you
can
wake
up
now
she
shivered
putting
her
face
against
him
oh
it
been
so
long
then
suddenly
she
caught
his
hand
come
she
said
breathlessly
come
quickly
to
dad
they
ran
across
the
park
hand
in
hand
near
the
house
jim
paused
i
say
old
chap
we
ca
take
him
by
surprise
he
said
i
was
going
to
sneak
in
by
the
back
door
and
get
hold
of
miss
de
lisle
and
allenby
to
tell
you
had
you
better
go
and
prepare
him
a
bit
yes
of
course
norah
said
there
a
light
in
the
study
always
there
at
this
time
come
in
and
i
hide
you
in
pantry
until
i
ring
they
crept
in
by
a
side
door
and
immediately
ran
into
the
butler
how
are
you
allenby
jim
inquired
pleasantly
allenby
staggered
back
it
mr
jim
he
gasped
turning
white
it
is
said
jim
laughing
he
found
the
butler
hand
and
shook
it
norah
left
them
and
went
swiftly
to
her
father
study
she
opened
the
door
softly
david
linton
was
sitting
in
a
big
armchair
by
the
fire
bending
forward
and
looking
into
the
red
coals
the
light
fell
on
his
face
and
showed
it
old
and
sad
with
a
depth
of
sadness
that
even
norah
had
hardly
seen
he
raised
his
head
as
the
door
opened
hallo
my
girl
he
said
forcing
a
smile
i
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
where
you
were
i
went
across
the
park
norah
said
nervously
something
in
her
voice
made
her
father
look
sharply
at
her
is
anything
the
matter
norah
no
she
said
quickly
she
came
close
to
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghost
he
said
what
is
it
norah
i
i
thought
i
had
too
she
stammered
but
it
was
better
than
a
ghost
daddy
daddy
she
broke
down
clinging
to
him
laughing
and
crying
what
is
it
cried
david
linton
for
god
sake
tell
me
norah
he
sprang
to
his
feet
shaking
he
here
she
said
he
is
dead
suddenly
she
broke
from
him
and
ran
to
the
bell
jim
she
said
jim
has
come
back
to
us
daddy
the
door
was
flung
open
and
jim
came
in
with
great
strides
dad
my
boy
said
his
father
they
gripped
each
other
hands
and
norah
clung
to
them
both
and
sobbed
and
laughed
all
at
once
let
me
sit
down
children
said
david
linton
presently
and
they
saw
that
he
was
trembling
i
getting
an
old
man
jim
i
did
know
how
old
i
was
until
we
lost
you
you
could
get
old
if
you
tried
said
jim
proudly
and
you
lose
me
either
can
he
norah
they
drew
together
again
it
seemed
complete
happiness
just
to
touch
each
other
not
to
speak
to
be
together
afterwards
there
would
be
explanations
but
they
seemed
the
last
thing
that
mattered
now
they
did
not
hear
the
hoot
of
a
motor
in
the
drive
or
a
ring
at
the
front
door
allenby
answered
it
and
admitted
a
tall
subaltern
mr
wally
evening
allenby
said
wally
i
believe
i
a
bit
ahead
of
time
i
did
expect
to
get
here
so
soon
do
you
think
they
have
a
corner
for
me
allenby
laughed
a
rather
quavering
laugh
i
think
you
always
find
your
room
ready
sir
he
said
you
i
suppose
you
our
good
news
sir
i
never
hear
good
news
said
wally
shortly
what
is
it
allenby
eyed
him
doubtfully
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
break
it
to
you
a
bit
sir
he
said
you
ca
be
yet
and
you
wounded
and
all
and
never
rightly
got
over
losing
jim
and
wally
shuddered
for
heaven
sake
man
stop
breaking
it
gently
he
said
what
is
it
in
his
voice
was
the
crisp
tone
of
the
officer
and
the
came
to
attention
smartly
it
jim
sir
he
said
for
a
long
moment
wally
stared
at
him
you
not
mad
i
suppose
he
said
slowly
or
perhaps
i
am
do
you
mean
them
could
kill
him
sir
allenby
voice
rose
on
a
note
of
triumph
let
me
take
your
coat
sir
in
the
study
and
you
coming
just
puts
the
top
on
everything
sir
he
reached
up
for
wally
coat
but
the
boy
broke
from
him
and
ran
blindly
to
the
study
bursting
in
upon
the
group
by
the
fire
there
he
stopped
dead
and
stared
at
them
old
chap
said
jim
he
sprang
to
him
and
flung
an
arm
round
his
shoulders
then
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
utter
contentment
and
echoed
allenby
unconsciously
well
if
that
does
make
everything
just
perfect
he
said
chapter
xx
all
clear
kiddie
are
you
awake
come
in
jimmy
norah
sat
up
in
bed
and
felt
for
the
electric
switch
the
room
sprang
into
light
as
jim
came
in
i
had
to
come
and
bring
your
stocking
he
said
merry
christmas
little
chap
merry
christmas
jimmy
dear
norah
looked
at
the
bulging
stocking
on
her
bed
and
broke
into
laughter
and
you
a
captain
oh
jimmy
are
you
ever
going
to
grow
up
i
trust
not
said
jim
comfortably
if
it
means
getting
any
bigger
than
i
am
but
you
not
either
so
it
does
matter
do
you
remember
all
the
christmases
at
billabong
when
i
had
to
bring
you
your
stocking
do
i
remember
echoed
norah
scornfully
but
at
billabong
it
was
daylight
at
four
in
the
morning
and
extremely
hot
probably
with
a
or
two
thrown
in
you
be
frozen
to
death
here
turn
on
the
electric
stove
and
we
be
comfy
that
a
said
jim
complying
i
must
admit
i
prefer
an
open
fireplace
and
logs
but
in
a
hurry
those
little
contraptions
of
stoves
are
handy
hold
on
now
i
get
you
something
to
put
over
your
shoulders
there
a
woolly
jacket
over
there
norah
said
let
me
have
my
property
i
excited
she
possessed
herself
of
the
stocking
and
fished
for
its
contents
chocolates
and
in
are
you
ashamed
not
much
said
jim
calmly
extracting
a
huge
chocolate
from
the
box
i
lived
on
swede
turnips
for
six
weeks
so
i
think
the
family
deserves
a
few
extras
fish
some
more
norah
obeyed
and
brought
to
light
articles
of
a
varied
nature
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
a
book
on
as
a
a
large
turnip
artistically
carved
a
box
of
french
candied
fruit
a
and
a
pair
of
housemaids
gloves
and
lastly
the
cap
of
a
shell
neatly
made
into
a
i
did
that
in
camp
in
germany
said
jim
and
i
swore
i
put
it
into
your
christmas
stocking
which
i
have
done
bless
you
said
norah
i
would
rather
lose
a
good
many
of
my
possessions
than
that
they
smiled
at
each
other
and
being
an
undemonstrative
pair
the
smile
was
a
caress
is
this
going
to
be
a
christmas
norah
said
i
been
lying
awake
for
ever
so
long
trying
to
realize
it
you
alive
again
i
never
was
dead
said
jim
indignantly
it
was
a
horribly
good
imitation
and
wally
here
and
even
harry
and
major
hunt
home
and
geoff
getting
stronger
every
day
and
dad
grown
twenty
years
younger
and
you

i
guess
judging
by
what
you
looked
like
the
night
i
came
home
oh
i
got
turned
and
made
up
to
look
like
new
said
norah
she
faltered
a
little
jimmy
i
been
saying
my
prayers
i
done
that
too
said
jim
there
was
a
long
contented
silence
and
somehow
now
i
know
you
be
all
right
both
of
you
norah
said
i
just
feel
certain
about
it
before
ever
since
the
war
began
i
was
always
horribly
afraid
but
now
i
not
afraid
any
more
it
ca
last
for
ever
and
some
day
we
all
go
back
and
that
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
said
jim
the
very
best
she
said
some
one
tapped
at
the
door
may
i
come
in
asked
miss
de
lisle
voice
she
entered
bearing
a
little
tray
you
said
norah
but
you
should
bride
and
katty
have
gone
to
church
so
i
thought
i
bring
you
some
tea
and
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
said
miss
de
lisle
but
i
did
expect
to
find
the
captain
here
she
did
not
wait
for
their
greetings
but
vanished
with
the
elephantine
swiftness
peculiar
to
her
returning
in
a
few
moments
with
a
second
tray
and
toast
said
jim
but
where
your
own
miss
de
lisle
never
mind
mine
i
have
it
in
the
kitchen
said
the
indeed
you
will
not
sit
down
he
marched
off
unheeding
her
protests
when
he
returned
he
bore
a
large
kitchen
tray
with
the
teapot
it
seemed
simpler
he
said
and
i
could
find
anything
smaller
this
cup
is
large
miss
de
lisle
but
then
you
wo
want
it
filled
so
often
have
some
of
my
toast
i
could
possibly
eat
all
this
well
it
very
pleasant
here
said
the
yielding
meekly
i
took
some
to
wally
but
he
merely
said
out
judkins
not
on
duty
and
rolled
over
so
i
concluded
in
katty
words
that
resht
was
more
to
him
and
came
away
he
wake
up
presently
and
be
very
pleased
to
find
it
it
matter
to
him
at
all
if
it
said
jim
queer
chap
wal
i
prefer
tea
with
the
chill
off
it
myself
judkins
has
hard
times
getting
him
up
in
time
for
early
parade
luckily
judkins
is
an
old
regular
soldier
and
has
a
stern
calm
way
with
a
young
officer
who
bullies
into
getting
up
may
i
ask
demanded
miss
de
lisle
i
used
to
be
bullied
by
a
gentleman
called
wilkes
in
the
grey
days
when
i
was
a
subaltern
said
jim
sadly
now
alas
i
am
a
responsible
and
dignified
person
and
i
have
to
set
an
example
he
sighed
it
awful
to
be
a
captain
it
so
extraordinary
said
his
sister
that
i
never
get
used
to
it
but
you
never
had
any
respect
for
age
said
jim
removing
her
tray
and
putting
a
pillow
on
her
head
every
one
finished
then
clear
away
the
wreck
and
go
and
dress
he
piled
the
three
trays
on
top
of
each
other
and
from
the
room
solemnly
his
long
legs
in
pyjamas
under
a
military
great
coat
ending
a
curious
effect
to
the
spectacle
miss
de
lisle
and
norah
laughed
helplessly
and
a
captain
said
the
wiping
her
eyes
now
i
really
must
run
or
there
will
be
no
breakfast
in
this
house
breakfast
was
a
movable
feast
in
the
home
for
tired
people
who
wandered
in
and
out
just
as
they
felt
inclined
hot
dishes
sat
on
a
plate
and
a
little
table
such
matters
as
ham
and
brawn
lurked
on
a
sideboard
and
allenby
came
in
from
time
to
time
to
replenish
tea
and
coffee
norah
and
her
father
rarely
encountered
any
one
but
phil
hardress
at
this
meal
since
theirs
was
generally
over
long
before
most
of
their
guests
had
decided
to
get
up
on
this
morning
however
every
one
was
equally
late
and
food
did
not
seem
to
matter
the
table
was
snowed
under
with
masses
of
letters
and
christmas
parcels
and
as
every
one
opened
these
and
talked
all
at
once
mingling
greetings
with
exclamations
over
the
contents
of
the
packages
miss
de
lisle
efforts
had
been
in
vain
i
pitied
your
said
aikman
the
wife
of
a
wounded
colonel
she
staggered
to
the
door
under
an
enormous
looking
as
though
christmas
were
anything
but
merry
however
i
saw
her
departing
after
an
interval
with
quite
a
sprightly
step
allenby
had
orders
to
look
after
her
norah
said
smiling
poor
soul
she
begins
her
round
at
some
unearthly
hour
and
she
hungry
and
tired
by
the
time
she
gets
here
one
of
the
remarkable
things
about
this
country
of
yours
said
linton
is
the
way
you
have
continued
to
deliver
parcels
and
letters
as
though
there
were
no
war
strange
females
or
gaunt
children
bring
them
to
one
door
but
the
main
point
is
that
they
do
come
in
australia
even
without
a
war
the
scorns
to
deliver
a
parcel
if
any
one
is
rash
enough
to
send
you
one
the
puts
it
in
a
cupboard
and
sends
you
a
cold
postcard
to
tell
you
to
come
and
take
it
away
if
you
do
come
soon
they
send
you
a
threatening
card
and
if
you
do
obey
that
i
never
dared
to
risk
a
third
said
linton
laughing
i
am
a
man
of
peace
but
what
a
horrible
system
said
aikman
does
it
interfere
with
business
oh
yes
greatly
said
her
host
but
i
suppose
we
shall
learn
in
time
i
going
over
to
the
cottage
norah
whispered
to
jim
do
come
geoff
wo
think
it
christmas
if
you
do
they
went
out
into
the
hall
flying
feet
came
down
the
stairs
and
wally
was
upon
them
merry
christmas
norah
he
seized
both
her
hands
and
pranced
her
down
the
hall
always
begin
christmas
with
a
he
chanted
begin
indeed
said
norah
with
a
fine
contempt
i
began
mine
hours
ago
where
have
you
been
i
have
been
contemplating
said
wally
his
brown
eyes
twinkling
no
one
called
me
there
evidence
to
the
contrary
jim
said
grinning
it
has
been
stated
that
you
called
a
perfectly
blameless
lady
judkins
and
said
awful
things
to
her
my
aunt
said
wally
i
hope
not
unless
you
talk
pretty
straight
to
judkins
he
does
notice
you
that
accounts
for
the
frozen
tea
and
toast
i
found
i
thought
father
christmas
had
put
there
did
you
eat
them
oh
yes
you
should
never
snub
a
saint
said
wally
so
now
i
want
any
breakfast
where
are
you
two
going
to
the
cottage
come
along
but
really
i
do
think
you
should
eat
a
decent
breakfast
wally
it
will
be
before
we
know
where
we
are
and
i
feel
that
miss
de
lisle
dinner
will
be
no
joke
said
wally
so
come
along
old
house
mother
and
do
worry
your
ancient
head
about
me
each
boy
seized
one
of
norah
hands
and
they
raced
across
the
lawn
david
linton
looking
at
them
from
the
window
laughed
a
little
bless
them
they
all
babies
again
he
thought
the
cottage
was
echoing
with
strange
sounds
it
might
be
inferred
that
the
stockings
of
the
young
hunts
had
contained
only
bugles
trumpets
and
drums
eva
sweeping
the
porch
greeted
the
newcomers
with
a
friendly
grin
merry
christmas
eva
the
sime

said
eva
ai
it
a
real
cold
morning
the
frorst
got
me
fingers
a
fair
treat
no
one

frost
on
christmas
day
it
the
proper
thing
in
this
queer
country
said
wally

father

to
you
eva

not
said
eva
the
children
would
of
anyfink
but
up
a
stockin
for
me
and
i
blowed
if
it
bang
full
this
mornin
and
a
from
me
young
man
from
the
front
it
that
saucy
i
wonder
it
ever
passed
the
sentry
well
i
do
say
as
this
place
ai
brought
us
nuffink
but
luck
geoffrey
dashed
out
equipped
with
a
miniature
sam
brown
belt
with
a
sword
and
waving
a
bugle
look
father
christmas
brought
them
merry
christmas
everybody
he
flung
himself
at
norah
with
a
mighty
hug
and
where
my
michael
and
that
alison
norah
asked
oh
michael
darling
are
you
the
lucky
one
as
he
appeared
crowned
with
a
paper
cap
and
drawing
a
wooden
engine
where
alison
it
no
good
ever
to
alison
geoffrey
said
with
scorn
she
got
a
silly
doll
in
her
stocking
and
all
she
do
is
to
sit
on
the
floor
and
take
off
its
clothes
girls
are
stupid
all
you
norah
keep
up
that
belief
my
son
and
you
be
spared
a
heap
of
trouble
said
major
hunt
coming
out
unfortunately
you
bound
to
change
your
mind
how
are
you
all
we
had
an
awful
morning
it
began
at
four
hunt
added
at
that
hour
michael
discovered
a
trumpet
and
no
one
has
been
asleep
since
they
talk
of
noise
at
the
front
said
her
husband
possibly
got
used
to
artillery
preparation
anyhow
it
strikes
me
as
a
small
thing
compared
to
my
trio
when
they
get
going
with
assorted
musical
instruments
how
is
your
small
family
miss
norah
not
quite
so
noisy
as
yours
but
still
you
would
notice
they
were
there
norah
answered
laughing
they
were
all
at
breakfast
when
i
left
and
it
seemed
likely
that
breakfast
would
run
on
to
dinner
unless
they
remembered
that
church
is
at
eleven
i
must
run
home
we
just
came
to
wish
you
all
a
merry
christmas
dinner
at
one
remember
we
wo
forget
hunt
said
every
one
was
dining
at
homewood
and
dinner
for
the
sake
of
the
children
was
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
house
was
full
of
guests
they
trooped
back
from
church
across
the
park
where
the
ground
rang
hard
as
iron
underfoot
for
it
was
a
frosty
christmas
homewood
glowed
with
colour
and
life
with
big
fires
blazing
everywhere
and
holly
and
ivy
scarlet
and
green
against
the
dark
oaken
panelling
of
the
walls
and
if
the
australians
sent
thoughts
overseas
to
a
red
homestead
billabong
nestling
in
its
green
of
orchard
and
garden
with
scorched
yellow
paddocks
stretching
away
for
miles
around
it
they
were
not
homesick
thoughts
for
home
was
in
their
hearts
and
they
were
together
once
more
the
dinner
was
a
simple
one
miss
de
lisle
had
reserved
her
finest
inspirations
for
the
evening
meal
regarding
christmas
dinner
as
a
mere
affair
of
turkey
and
blazing
which
except
in
the
matter
of
sauces
might
be
managed
by
any
one
it
needs
no
soul
she
said
but
no
one
found
any
fault
and
at
the
end
colonel
aikman
made
a
little
speech
of
thanks
to
their
hosts
we
all
know
they
hate
speeches
made
at
them
he
finished
but
homewood
is
a
blessed
word
to
fighting
men
and
their
wives
said
aikman
yes
to
people
who
came
to
it
tired
beyond
expression
and
went
back
forgetting
weariness
in
their
names
in
the
names
of
all
of
us
we
want
to
say
you
david
linton
stood
up
looking
down
the
long
room
and
last
at
his
son
we
who
are
the
most
thankful
people
in
the
world
i
think
he
said
do
not
feel
that
you
owe
us
any
gratitude
rather
we
owe
it
to
all
our
tired
people
who
helped
us
through
our
own
share
of
what
war
can
mean
and
apart
from
that
we
never
feel
that
the
work
is
ours
we
carry
on
for
the
sake
of
a
dead
man
a
man
who
loved
his
country
so
keenly
that
to
die
for
it
was
his
highest
happiness
we
are
only
tools
glad
of
so
easy
and
pleasant
as
our
guests
make
our
job
but
the
work
is
john
so
far
as
we
can
we
mean
to
make
it
live
to
his
memory
he
paused
norah
looking
up
at
him
saw
him
through
misty
eyes
so
we
know
you
think
of
us
kindly
after
we
have
gone
back
to
australia
the
deep
voice
went
on
there
will
be
a
welcome
there
too
for
any
of
you
who
come
to
see
us
but
when
you
remember
homewood
please
do
not
think
of
it
as
ours
if
that
brave
soul
can
look
back
as
he
said
he
would
and
as
we
are
sure
he
does
then
he
is
happy
over
every
tired
fighter
who
goes
rested
from
his
house
his
only
grief
was
that
he
could
not
fight
himself
but
his
work
in
the
war
goes
on
and
as
for
us
we
simply
consider
ourselves
very
lucky
to
be
his
instruments
again
he
paused
i
do
think
this
is
a
day
for
drinking
toasts
he
said
when
we
have
won
we
can
do
that
but
we
have
not
won
yet
but
i
will
ask
you
all
to
drink
to
a
brave
man
memory
to
john
the
short
afternoon
drew
quickly
to
dusk
and
lights
flashed
out
to
be
discreetly
veiled
lest
wandering
german
aircraft
should
wish
to
drop
bombs
as
christmas
presents
norah
and
the
boys
had
disappeared
mysteriously
after
dinner
vanishing
into
the
study
presently
geoffrey
came
flying
to
his
mother
with
eager
eyes
mother
father
christmas
is
here
you
do
say
so
said
hunt
affecting
extreme
astonishment
where
i
saw
him
run
along
the
hall
and
go
into
the
study
he
was
real
mother
of
course
he
real
major
hunt
said
do
you
think
he
gone
up
the
study
chimney
wally
appeared
in
the
doorway
will
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
kindly
walk
into
the
study
he
said
solemnly
we
have
a
distinguished
guest
there
i
you
said
geoffrey
ecstatically
he
tugged
at
his
father
hand
capering
in
the
study
a
great
towered
to
the
ceiling
a
of
the
most
beautiful
description
gay
with
shining
coloured
globes
and
wax
lights
and
paper
lanterns
laden
with
mysterious
packages
in
white
paper
tied
with
ribbon
of
red
white
and
blue
and
with
other
things
about
which
there
was
no
mystery
clockwork
toys
field
guns
and
ambulance
wagons
and
a
big
splendid
red
cross
nurse
difficult
to
consider
a
mere
doll
never
was
seen
such
a
laden
tree
branches
groaned
under
the
weight
they
bore
and
beside
it
who
but
father
christmas
bowing
and
smiling
with
his
eyes
twinkling
under
bushy
white
eyebrows
walk
in
ladies
and
gentleman
walk
in
he
said
invitingly
wally
frowned
at
him
that
not
the
way
to
talk
he
said
you
are
a
he
inflicted
a
surreptitious
kick
upon
the
elderly
saint
hi
you
blighter
that
my
shin
said
father
christmas
wrathfully
a
remark
luckily
unheard
by
the
guests
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
all
the
household
was
there
miss
de
lisle
beaming
at
wally
and
very
stately
and
handsome
in
blue
silk
the
servants
led
by
allenby
with
con
and
katty
and
bride
giggling
with
astonishment
at
a
tree
the
like
of
which
did
not
grow
in
donegal
all
mustered
said
father
christmas
right
oh
i
mean
that
is
well
as
you
see
i
had
no
end
of
a
time
labouring
in
your
behalf
but
i
love
hard
work
interruption
from
meadows
sounding
like
i
think
being
tired
i
shall
depute
to
my
dear
young
friend
here
the
task
of
removing
the
parcels
from
the
tree
he
tapped
wally
severely
on
the
head
with
his
knuckles
and
that
hapless
youth
ejaculated
beast
you
get
thrown
out
if
you
watch
it
said
the
saint
severely
now
ladies
first
he
detached
the
red
cross
nurse
from
her
bough
and
placed
her
in
alison
arms
and
alison
who
had
glued
her
eyes
to
her
from
the
moment
of
entering
the
room
uttered
a
gasp
sat
promptly
upon
the
floor
and
began
an
exhaustive
examination
of
her
charms
unheeding
any
further
gifts
under
the
onslaught
of
wally
and
harry
the
tree
speedily
became
stripped
of
its
burden
father
christmas
directing
their
labours
in
a
voice
that
plainly
had
its
training
on
the
eva
watched
him
admiringly
ai
the
captin
a
trick
she
murmured
hugging
her
parcels
to
her
the
last
package
came
down
and
father
christmas
slipped
away
disappearing
behind
a
screen
with
a
flourish
that
revealed
an
immaculate
brown
leather
gaiter
under
the
snow
bordering
his
red
cloak
and
presently
jim
sauntered
out
slightly
flushed
oh
you
silly
said
geoffrey
where
have
you
been
missed
ole
father
christmas
i
never
did
have
any
luck
jim
said
dolefully
never
mind
he
left
heaps
and
heaps
of
parcels
for
you
i
help
you
open
them
said
geoffrey
kindly
the
gong
summoned
them
to
tea
and
afterwards
it
was
time
to
take
the
children
home
happy
and
sleepy
jim
tossed
alison
up
on
his
shoulder
and
with
geoffrey
clinging
to
his
other
hand
and
michael
riding
wally
norah
and
the
boys
escorted
the
hunts
back
to
the
cottage
you
coming
over
again
of
course

a
terribly
frivolous
old
couple

hunt
laughing
but
christmas

a
year

her
husband
knitting
his
brows
over
this
remarkable
statement
come
in

awhile

neck

all
of

at

closed
and
they
turned
back

a
lovely
time

said

was
such
a
christmas

said

months

germany

worth
it
no
said
wally
sharply
no
it
was
norah
agreed
but
now
it
helps
one
to
forget
they
came
slowly
across
the
frozen
lawn
before
them
homewood
loomed
up
little
beams
of
warm
light
coming
from
its
shuttered
windows
then
the
door
opened
wide
letting
out
a
flood
of
radiance
and
in
it
stood
david
linton
looking
out
for
them
they
came
into
the
path
of
light
norah
between
the
two
tall
lads
his

as
