chapter
i
a
great
change
there
no
doubt
about
it
we
really
must
economize
somehow
sighed
woodward
helplessly
with
her
housekeeping
book
in
one
hand
and
her
bank
in
the
other
and
an
array
of
bills
spread
out
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
children
do
you
hear
what
i
say
the
war
will
make
a
great
difference
to
our
income
and
we
ca
simply
go
on
living
in
exactly
the
old
way
the
sooner
we
all
realize
it
the
better
i
wish
i
knew
where
to
begin
might
knock
off
going
to
church
and
save
the
money
we
give
in
collections
suggested
percy
flippantly
it
must
tot
up
to
quite
a
decent
sum
in
the
course
of
a
year
not
to
mention
pew
rent
his
mother
cast
a
reproachful
glance
at
him
now
percy
be
serious
for
once
you
and
winona
are
quite
old
enough
to
understand
business
matters
i
must
discuss
them
with
somebody
as
i
said
before
we
shall
really
have
to
economize
somehow
and
the
question
is
where
to
begin
i
saw
some
hints
in
a
magazine
the
other
day
volunteered
winona
hunting
among
a
pile
of
papers
and
fishing
up
a
copy
of
housewife
here
you
are
there
a
whole
article
on
war
economies
it
says
you
can
halve
your
expenses
if
you
only
try
it
gives
ten
different
recipes
number
one
dispense
with
servants
oh
goody
i
do
know
how
the
house
would
get
along
without
maggie
and
mary
that
rather
stiff
it
impossible
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
i
should
never
dream
of
dismissing
maids
who
have
lived
with
me
for
years
i
read
that
article
and
it
may
be
practicable
for
other
people
but
certainly
not
for
us
oh
dear
some
of
my
friends
recommend
me
to
remove
to
the
town
and
others
say
where
you
are
and
keep
poultry
we
ca
leave
highfield
we
were
all
born
here
objected
winona
decisively
and
we
tried
keeping
hens
some
time
ago
said
percy
they
laid
on
an
average
of
an
egg
a
year
each
as
far
as
i
remember
i
afraid
we
did
know
how
to
manage
them
replied
woodward
fretfully
percy
leave
those
papers
alone
i
did
tell
you
to
turn
them
over
you
mixing
them
all
up
tiresome
boy
do
touch
them
again
it
no
use
trying
to
discuss
business
with
you
children
i
shall
write
and
consult
aunt
harriet
go
away
both
of
you
now
i
want
to
have
a
quiet
aunt
harriet
stood
to
the
woodward
family
somewhat
in
the
light
of
a
delphic
oracle
to
apply
to
her
was
always
the
very
last
resource
matters
must
have
reached
a
crisis
winona
thought
if
they
were
obliged
to
appeal
to
aunt
harriet
judgment
she
followed
percy
into
the
garden
with
a
sober
look
on
her
face
you
do
think
mother
would
really
leave
highfield
she
asked
her
brother
anxiously
bunkum
replied
that
youth
we
always
have
more
or
less
of
a
fuss
when
my
school
bills
come
in
it
soon
fizzle
out
again
do
you
fret
yourself
things
will
jog
on
as
they
always
have
jogged
on
there
be
nothing
done
you
see
come
on
and
bowl
for
me
that
a
chubby
one
but
this
time
mother
really
seemed
to
be
in
earnest
said
winona
meditatively
as
she
helped
to
put
up
the
stumps
woodward
had
been
left
a
widow
three
years
before
this
story
opens
she
was
a
fair
fragile
little
woman
still
pretty
and
pathetically
helpless
she
had
been
accustomed
to
lean
upon
her
husband
and
now
for
lack
of
firmer
support
she
leaned
upon
winona
winona
was
young
to
act
as
prop
and
though
it
flattered
her
sense
of
importance
it
had
put
a
row
of
wrinkles
on
her
girlish
forehead
at
fifteen
she
seemed
much
older
than
percy
at
sixteen
no
one
ever
dreamt
of
taking
percy
seriously
he
was
one
of
those
jolly
unreliable
people
who
saunter
through
life
with
no
other
aim
than
to
amuse
themselves
at
all
costs
to
depend
upon
him
was
like
trusting
to
a
boat
without
a
bottom
though
nominally
the
eldest
he
had
little
more
sense
of
responsibility
than
ernie
the
youngest
it
was
winona
who
shouldered
the
family
burdens
the
woodwards
had
always
lived
at
highfield
and
in
their
opinion
it
was
the
most
desirable
residence
in
the
whole
of
rytonshire
the
house
was
old
enough
to
be
picturesque
but
modern
enough
for
comfort
its
quaint
gables
mullioned
windows
and
cromwellian
porch
were
the
joy
of
photographers
while
the
hall
when
the
big
log
fire
was
lighted
would
be
hard
to
beat
for
coziness
the
schoolroom
on
the
ground
floor
had
a
separate
side
entrance
on
to
the
lawn
leading
through
a
small
where
boots
and
coats
and
cricket
bats
and
tennis
rackets
could
be
kept
the
had
a
luxurious
ingle
nook
with
cushioned
seats
and
all
the
bedrooms
but
two
had
a
southern
aspect
as
for
the
big
rambling
garden
it
was
full
of
delightful
flowers
that
came
up
year
after
year
daffodils
and
violets
and
and
clumps
of
pinks
and
orange
lilies
and
canterbury
bells
and
tall
michaelmas
daisies
and
ribbon
grass
and
royal
osmunda
fern
the
sort
of
flowers
that
people
used
to
pick
in
days
gone
by
put
a
paper
frill
round
and
call
a
nosegay
or
a
posy
there
was
a
lawn
for
tennis
and
cricket
a
pond
planted
with
irises
and
bulrushes
and
a
wild
corner
where
crocuses
and
coltsfoot
and
golden
aconite
came
up
as
they
liked
in
the
spring
time
winona
loved
this
garden
with
somewhat
the
same
attachment
that
a
french
peasant
bears
for
the
soil
upon
which
he
has
been
reared
she
rejoiced
in
every
yard
of
it
to
go
away
and
resign
it
to
others
would
be
tragedy
unspeakable
the
fear
that
aunt
harriet
might
recommend
the
family
to
leave
highfield
was
sufficient
to
darken
her
horizon
indefinitely
that
her
mother
had
written
to
consult
the
oracle
she
was
well
aware
for
she
had
been
sent
to
post
the
letter
she
had
an
instinctive
apprehension
that
the
answer
would
prove
a
in
her
career
for
a
day
or
two
everything
went
on
as
usual
woodward
did
not
again
allude
to
her
difficulties
percy
had
conveniently
forgotten
them
and
the
younger
children
were
not
aware
of
their
existence
winona
lived
with
a
black
spot
dancing
before
her
mental
eyes
it
was
continually
rising
up
and
blotting
out
the
sunshine
on
the
fourth
morning
appeared
a
letter
addressed
in
an
slanting
handwriting
and
bearing
the
seaton
post
mark
woodward
read
it
in
silence
and
left
her
toast
unfinished
aunt
harriet
communications
generally
upset
her
for
the
day
come
here
winona
she
said
agitatedly
after
breakfast
oh
dear
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
it
so
very
unexpected
but
of
course
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
for
you
if
only
i
could
consult
somebody
i
suppose
girls
nowadays
will
have
to
learn
to
support
themselves
and
the
war
will
alter
everything
but
i
always
meant
you
to
stop
at
home
and
look
after
the
little
ones
for
me
and
it
very
what
does
aunt
harriet
say
mother
interrupted
winona
with
a
catch
in
her
throat
she
says
a
great
deal
and
i
dare
say
she
right
oh
this
terrible
war
things
were
so
different
when
i
was
a
girl
you
might
as
well
read
the
letter
for
yourself
as
it
concerns
you
i
always
think
she
hard
on
percy
poor
lad
i
was
afraid
the
children
were
too
noisy
the
last
time
she
was
here
but
they
would
keep
quiet
i
sure
i
try
to
do
my
best
all
round
and
you
know
winona
how
i
said
aunt
harriet
but
winona
was
already
devouring
the
letter
abbey
close
seaton
august
my
dear
florita
you
are
quite
right
to
consult
me
in
your
difficulties
and
are
welcome
to
any
advice
which
i
am
able
to
offer
you
i
am
sorry
to
hear
of
your
financial
embarrassments
but
i
am
not
surprised
the
present
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
and
extra
taxation
will
make
retrenchments
necessary
to
everybody
in
the
circumstances
i
should
not
advise
you
to
leave
highfield
oh
thank
goodness
ejaculated
winona
the
expense
of
a
removal
would
probably
cancel
what
you
would
otherwise
save
neither
should
i
recommend
you
to
take
percy
from
longworth
college
and
send
him
daily
to
be
coached
by
your
parish
curate
from
my
knowledge
of
his
character
i
consider
the
discipline
of
a
public
school
to
be
indispensable
if
he
is
to
grow
into
worthy
manhood
and
sooner
than
allow
the
wholesome
restraint
of
his
house
master
to
be
removed
at
this
critical
portion
of
his
life
i
will
myself
defray
half
the
cost
of
his
maintenance
for
the
next
two
years
now
as
regards
winona
i
believe
she
has
ability
and
it
is
high
time
to
begin
to
think
seriously
what
you
mean
to
do
with
her
in
the
future
women
will
have
to
depend
upon
themselves
and
i
consider
that
all
girls
should
be
trained
to
gain
their
own
living
the
foundation
of
every
career
is
a
good
education
without
this
it
is
impossible
to
build
at
all
and
winona
certainly
can
not
obtain
it
if
she
remains
at
home
the
new
high
school
at
seaton
is
offering
two
open
scholarships
to
girls
resident
in
the
county
the
examination
for
which
is
on
september
i
propose
that
winona
enters
for
this
examination
and
that
if
she
should
be
a
successful
candidate
she
should
come
to
live
with
me
during
the
period
of
her
attendance
at
the
high
school
the
education
is
the
best
possible
there
is
a
prospect
of
a
university
scholarship
to
be
competed
for
and
every
help
and
encouragement
is
given
to
the
girls
in
their
choice
of
a
career
with
winona
off
your
hands
i
should
suggest
that
you
should
engage
a
competent
nursery
governess
to
teach
the
younger
children
the
elements
of
order
and
discipline
i
would
gladly
pay
her
salary
on
the
understanding
that
i
should
myself
select
her
trusting
that
these
proposals
may
be
of
some
service
and
hoping
to
hear
a
better
account
of
your
health
i
remain
your
affectionate
aunt
and
godmother
harriet
beach
winona
laid
down
the
letter
with
an
agitated
gasp
the
proposition
almost
took
her
breath
away
what
an
idea
she
exclaimed
indignantly
mother
of
course
you
even
dream
of
it
for
an
instant
i
to
go
and
live
with
aunt
harriet
it
not
to
be
thought
of
well
i
do
know
winona
wavered
woodward
we
must
look
at
it
from
all
sides
and
perhaps
aunt
harriet
right
and
it
really
would
be
for
the
best
miss
harmon
a
poor
teacher
and
i
sure
your
music
at
any
rate
is
not
a
credit
to
her
you
played
that
last
piece
shockingly
out
of
time
you
know
you
said
yourself
that
you
were
getting
beyond
miss
harmon
whatever
impeachments
winona
may
have
brought
against
her
teacher
she
was
certainly
not
prepared
to
admit
them
now
she
rejected
the
project
of
the
seaton
high
school
with
the
utmost
energy
and
determination
bringing
into
the
fray
all
that
force
of
character
which
her
mother
lacked
poor
woodward
vacillated
feebly
she
was
generally
swayed
by
whoever
was
nearest
at
the
moment
and
i
verily
believe
arguments
would
have
prevailed
and
the
whole
scheme
would
have
been
abandoned
had
not
joynson
opportunely
happened
to
turn
up
joynson
was
a
solicitor
and
the
trustee
of
property
he
managed
most
of
her
business
affairs
and
some
of
her
private
ones
as
well
she
had
confidence
in
his
judgment
and
she
at
once
thankfully
submitted
the
question
of
winona
future
to
his
decision
the
very
thing
for
her
he
declared
do
her
a
world
of
good
to
go
to
a
proper
school
she
frittering
her
time
away
here
send
her
to
seaton
by
all
means
what
are
you
to
do
without
her
nonsense
indispensable
especially
a
girl
of
fifteen
pack
her
off
as
soon
as
you
can
does
want
to
go
oh
she
sing
a
different
song
when
once
she
gets
there
you
see
thus
supported
by
masculine
authority
woodward
settled
the
question
in
the
affirmative
and
replied
to
her
aunt
by
return
of
post
naturally
such
a
stupendous
event
as
the
exodus
of
winona
made
a
sensation
in
the
household
well
of
all
the
rum
shows
exclaimed
percy
you
and
aunt
harriet
in
double
harness
it
beats
me
altogether
it
atrocious
groaned
winona
i
a
victim
sacrificed
for
the
good
of
the
family
oh
why
could
mother
have
thought
of
some
other
way
of
economizing
i
do
want
to
win
scholarships
and
go
in
for
a
career
buck
up
perhaps
you
wo
win
there
be
others
in
for
the
you
bet
you
probably
fail
and
come
whining
home
like
a
whipped
puppy
with
its
tail
between
its
legs
indeed
i
sha
flared
winona
indignantly
i
a
little
more
spirit
than
that
thank
you
and
why
should
you
imagine
i
going
to
fail
i
suppose
i
as
much
brains
as
most
people
that
right
upset
the
i
was
only
trying
to
comfort
you
teased
percy
in
my
opinion
you
be
returned
like
a
bad
halfpenny
or
one
of
those
articles
no
use
to
anybody
except
the
owner
aunt
harriet
will
be
cheated
of
her
prey
after
all
if
win
goes
away
i
shall
be
the
eldest
daughter
at
home
said
letty
airily
shaking
out
her
short
skirts
i
sit
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
pour
out
tea
if
mother
has
a
headache
and
unlock
the
apple
room
and
use
the
best
inkpot
if
i
like
and
have
first
innings
at
the
piano
you
forget
about
the
nursery
governess
retorted
winona
if
i
go
she
comes
and
you
find
you
exchanged
king
log
for
king
stork
oh
very
well
just
wait
and
see
it
wo
be
as
idyllic
as
you
imagine
i
shall
be
saved
the
trouble
of
looking
after
you
at
any
rate
what
i
trying
to
ascertain
madam
said
percy
blandly
is
whether
your
ladyship
wishes
to
take
up
your
residence
in
seaton
or
not
with
the
usual
perversity
of
your
sex
you
pursue
a
pig
policy
when
i
venture
to
picture
you
seated
at
the
board
of
your
venerable
aunt
you
protest
you
are
a
sacrifice
when
on
the
other
hand
i
suggest
your
return
to
the
bosom
of
your
family
you
revile
me
equally
you
the
most
unsympathetic
i
ever
met
declared
winona
aggrievedly
when
she
analyzed
her
feelings
however
she
was
obliged
to
allow
that
they
were
mixed
though
the
prospect
of
settling
down
at
seaton
filled
her
with
dismay
percy
gibe
at
her
probable
failure
touched
her
pride
winona
had
always
been
counted
as
the
clever
member
of
the
family
it
would
be
too
ignominious
to
be
sent
home
labeled
unfit
she
set
her
teeth
and
clenched
her
fists
at
the
bare
notion
i
show
them
all
what
i
can
do
if
i
take
a
thing
up
she
resolved
in
the
meantime
woodward
was
immersed
in
the
subject
of
clothing
every
post
brought
her
boxes
of
patterns
amongst
which
she
hesitated
lost
in
choice
if
i
knew
whether
you
really
going
to
stay
at
seaton
or
not
it
would
make
all
the
difference
winona
she
fluttered
it
no
use
buying
you
these
new
things
if
you
only
to
wear
them
at
home
but
make
an
effort
to
send
you
nice
to
aunt
harriet
i
know
criticize
everything
you
have
on
dear
me
i
think
i
better
risk
it
it
would
be
such
a
nuisance
to
have
to
write
for
the
patterns
all
over
again
and
how
could
i
get
your
dresses
fitted
when
you
were
here
to
be
tried
on
miss
jones
is
at
liberty
now
and
can
come
for
a
sewing
but
she
probably
be
busy
if
i
want
her
later
now
tell
me
which
do
you
really
think
is
the
prettier
of
these
two
shades
i
like
the
fawn
but
i
believe
the
material
will
spot
what
have
you
done
with
the
lace
collar
aunt
harriet
gave
you
last
christmas
she
sure
to
ask
about
it
if
you
do
wear
it
having
decided
that
on
the
whole
she
intended
to
win
a
scholarship
winona
bluffed
off
the
matter
of
her
departure
i
changed
my
mind
that
all
she
announced
to
her
home
circle
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
not
to
hear
mamie
scraping
away
at
her
violin
in
the
evenings
or
letty
strumming
at
scales
think
what
a
relief
not
to
be
obliged
to
rout
up
dorrie
and
godfrey
and
haul
them
off
to
school
every
day
i
tired
of
setting
an
example
you
snigger
the
family
grinned
appreciatively
they
understood
winona
do
you
worry
i
set
the
example
when
you
gone
letty
assured
her
i
be
as
improving
as
a
i
wish
i
your
chance
stand
aunt
harriet
for
the
sake
of
going
to
a
big
high
school
younger
sisters
never
have
any
luck
eldests
just
sweep
the
board
i
do
know
where
we
come
in
do
you
fret
young
you
score
later
on
cooed
an
indulgent
voice
from
the
sofa
where
percy
sprawled
with
a
book
and
a
bag
of
walnuts
remember
that
when
you
still
in
all
the
bliss
and
sparkle
of
your
teens
winona
be
a
mature
and
person
of
eldest
miss
woodward
getting
on
you
know
people
will
say
and
somebody
reply
poor
thing
they
wo
when
i
got
a
career
retorted
winona
pelting
percy
with
his
own
you
assured
us
the
other
day
that
you
despised
such
vanities
well
it
depends
perhaps
i
be
a
lady
tram
conductor
and
punch
tickets
or
a
or
drive
a
government
van
if
those
are
careers
for
girls
bag
me
for
a
steeple
jack
chirped
dorrie
it
was
perhaps
a
good
thing
for
winona
that
such
a
short
interval
elapsed
between
the
acceptance
of
aunt
harriet
proposal
and
the
date
of
the
scholarship
examination
the
ten
days
were
very
busy
ones
for
there
seemed
much
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
preparation
miss
jones
the
dressmaker
was
installed
in
the
nursery
with
the
and
demanded
frequent
a
process
winona
hated
i
shall
buy
all
my
clothes
ready
made
when
i
grown
up
she
declared
they
very
seldom
fit
and
have
to
be
altered
returned
her
mother
do
stand
still
winona
and
i
hope
you
learning
up
a
few
dates
and
facts
for
this
examination
you
ought
to
be
studying
every
morning
if
only
miss
harmon
were
home
i
have
asked
her
to
coach
you
i
afraid
she
be
disappointed
at
your
leaving
but
of
course
she
ca
expect
to
keep
you
for
ever
i
heard
a
rumor
that
she
means
to
give
up
her
school
altogether
and
go
and
live
with
her
uncle
i
hope
it
true
and
then
i
can
take
the
little
ones
away
with
an
easy
conscience
i
want
to
treat
her
badly
poor
thing
but
i
sure
teaching
not
her
vocation
winona
really
made
a
heroic
effort
to
prepare
herself
for
the
coming
ordeal
she
retired
to
a
secluded
part
of
the
garden
and
read
over
her
latest
school
books
the
process
landed
her
in
the
depths
of
despondency
i
never
remember
anything
never
she
mourned
to
her
family
to
try
and
get
all
this
into
my
head
at
once
is
like
bolting
a
week
meals
at
a
single
go
i
know
a
date
here
and
there
and
i
a
hazy
notion
of
french
and
latin
verbs
and
a
general
impression
of
other
subjects
but
if
they
ask
me
for
anything
definite
such
as
the
battles
of
the
wars
of
the
roses
or
a
list
of
the
products
of
india
i
done
for
go
in
for
then
suggested
percy
write
from
a
romantic
standpoint
and
do
condescend
to
mere
facts
stick
in
a
quotation
or
two
and
a
drawing
if
possible
and
make
your
paper
sound
eloquent
and
dramatic
and
poetical
and
all
the
rest
of
it
they
mark
you
low
for
accuracy
but
put
you
on
ten
per
cent
for
style
you
bet
i
know
a
chap
who
tries
it
on
at
the
and
it
always
pays
it
worth
thinking
about
certainly
said
winona
shutting
her
books
with
a
weary
yawn
chapter
ii
an
entrance
examination
the
seaton
high
school
was
a
large
handsome
brick
building
exactly
opposite
the
public
park
it
had
only
been
erected
two
years
ago
so
everything
about
it
was
absolutely
new
and
it
supplied
a
great
need
in
the
rapidly
growing
city
and
indeed
offered
the
best
and
most
education
to
be
obtained
in
the
district
it
was
the
aim
of
the
school
to
fit
girls
for
various
professions
and
careers
there
was
a
classical
and
a
modern
side
a
department
for
domestic
economy
and
a
commercial
class
for
instruction
in
business
details
art
music
and
nature
study
were
well
catered
for
and
manual
training
was
not
forgotten
as
the
school
was
intended
to
become
in
time
a
center
for
the
county
the
governors
had
offered
two
open
free
scholarships
to
be
competed
for
by
girls
resident
in
other
parts
of
rytonshire
hoping
by
this
means
to
attract
pupils
from
the
country
places
round
about
on
the
morning
of
september
precisely
at
winona
presented
herself
at
the
school
for
the
scholarship
examination
there
were
twenty
other
candidates
awaiting
the
ordeal
in
various
stages
of
nervousness
or
sangfroid
some
looked
dejected
some
confident
and
others
hid
their
feelings
under
a
mask
of
stolidity
winona
joined
them
shyly
they
were
all
unknown
to
one
another
and
so
far
nobody
had
plucked
up
courage
to
venture
a
remark
it
is
horribly
depressing
to
sit
on
a
form
staring
at
twenty
taciturn
strangers
winona
bore
for
awhile
with
the
stony
silence
then
rather
frightened
at
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
she
announced
i
suppose
we
all
going
in
for
this
same
it
was
a
trite
commonplace
but
it
broke
the
ice
everybody
looked
relieved
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
clear
yes
we
all
going
in
that
right
enough
replied
a
girl
in
spectacles
but
there
are
only
two
scholarships
so
nineteen
of
us
are
bound
to
fail
that
logic
and
mathematics
and
all
the
rest
of
it
whew
a
nice
cheering
prospect
wish
they
put
us
out
of
our
misery
at
once
groaned
a
stout
girl
with
a
long
fair
pigtail
i
all
upset
shivered
another
it
like
a
game
of
musical
chairs
suggested
a
fourth
we
all
scrambling
for
the
same
thing
and
some
are
bound
to
be
out
of
it
the
girl
laughed
nervously
suppose
we
got
to
take
our
sporting
luck
she
murmured
if
nineteen
are
sure
to
lose
two
are
sure
to
win
at
any
rate
said
winona
that
logic
and
mathematics
and
all
the
rest
of
it
too
right
you
are
that
a
more
cheering
creed
it
does
do
to
cry
me
too
soon
chirped
a
girl
with
a
red
say
die
till
you
dead
is
my
motto
i
wearing
a
swastika
for
a
mascot
said
a
short
pale
girl
exhibiting
her
charm
which
hung
from
a
chain
round
her
neck
i
never
am
lucky
so
i
thought
i
try
what
this
would
do
for
me
for
once
i
know
english
history
beautifully
down
to
the
end
of
queen
anne
and
no
further
and
if
they
set
any
questions
on
the
georges
i
be
stumped
i
learnt
africa
but
asia
would
floor
me
observed
another
looking
up
from
a
geography
book
in
which
she
was
making
a
last
desperate
clutch
at
likely
items
of
knowledge
i
never
can
remember
which
side
of
india
madras
is
on
i
get
it
hopelessly
mixed
with
bombay
i
wish
to
goodness
they
go
ahead
and
begin
mourned
the
owner
of
the
red
it
this
waiting
that
knocks
the
spirit
out
of
me
patience
is
my
pet
virtue
i
call
it
cruelty
to
animals
to
leave
us
on
almost
as
if
in
answer
to
her
pathetic
appeal
the
door
opened
and
a
teacher
appeared
in
a
brisk
manner
she
marshaled
the
candidates
into
line
and
conducted
them
to
the
door
of
the
study
where
one
by
one
they
were
admitted
for
a
brief
private
interview
winona
turn
came
about
the
middle
of
the
row
pass
in
as
quickly
as
you
can
please
commanded
the
teacher
motioning
her
onward
as
winona
entered
she
gave
one
hasty
comprehensive
glance
round
the
room
taking
in
a
general
impression
of
books
busts
and
pictures
then
focussed
her
attention
on
the
figure
that
sat
at
the
desk
it
was
only
at
a
later
date
that
she
grasped
any
details
of
miss
personality
at
that
first
meeting
she
realized
nothing
but
the
pair
of
compelling
blue
eyes
that
drew
her
forward
like
a
magnet
your
name
winona
woodward
age
fifteen
residence
highfield
ashbourne
near
great
marston
how
long
have
you
lived
in
the
county
of
rytonshire
ever
since
i
was
born
miss
bishop
hastily
ticked
off
these
replies
on
a
page
of
her
ledger
and
handed
winona
a
card
this
will
admit
you
to
the
examination
room
remember
that
instead
of
putting
your
name
at
the
head
of
your
papers
you
are
to
write
the
number
given
you
on
your
card
any
candidate
writing
her
own
name
will
be
disqualified
next
girl
it
was
all
over
in
two
minutes
winona
seemed
hardly
to
have
entered
the
room
before
she
was
out
again
move
on
please
said
the
teacher
marshaling
the
little
crowd
round
the
door
will
those
who
have
seen
miss
bishop
kindly
go
along
the
corridor
several
girls
who
had
been
standing
in
a
knot
made
a
sudden
bolt
and
pushed
their
fellows
forward
somebody
jogged
winona
elbow
her
card
slid
from
her
grasp
and
fell
on
to
the
ground
as
she
bent
in
the
crush
to
pick
it
up
the
girl
stooped
on
a
like
errand
dropped
mine
too
clumsy
is
it
she
laughed
hope
we
got
our
own
what
was
your
number
i
had
time
to
look
well
i
sure
mine
was
eleven
so
that
all
right
i
wish
you
luck
wo
we
just
be
glad
when
it
over
rather
at
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
was
a
door
with
a
notice
pinned
on
to
it
examination
for
county
scholarships
a
mistress
stood
there
and
scrutinized
each
girl
card
as
she
entered
directing
her
to
a
seat
in
the
room
marked
with
the
corresponding
number
winona
walked
rather
solemnly
to
the
desk
labeled
the
great
ordeal
was
at
last
about
to
begin
she
wondered
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
little
thrills
of
nervousness
seemed
running
down
her
back
like
drops
from
a
her
hands
were
trembling
with
a
great
effort
she
pulled
herself
together
it
no
use
funking
she
thought
i
make
as
good
a
shot
as
i
can
at
things
and
if
i
fail
well
i
shall
have
plenty
of
companions
in
misfortune
at
any
rate
a
pile
of
foolscap
paper
with
margins
a
clean
sheet
of
white
blotting
paper
and
a
penholder
with
a
new
nib
lay
ready
each
of
the
other
twenty
victims
was
surveying
a
supply
of
similar
material
on
the
blackboard
was
chalked
the
word
silence
in
a
dead
hush
the
candidates
sat
and
waited
exactly
on
the
stroke
of
nine
miss
bishop
entered
and
handed
a
sheaf
of
printed
questions
to
the
teacher
in
charge
who
distributed
them
round
the
room
the
subject
for
the
first
hour
was
arithmetic
winona
read
over
her
paper
slowly
she
felt
capable
of
managing
it
all
except
the
last
two
problem
sums
which
were
outside
her
experience
she
knew
it
would
mainly
be
a
question
of
accuracy
i
work
them
each
twice
if
i
only
time
she
thought
starting
at
number
one
an
hour
is
after
all
only
made
up
of
sixty
minutes
and
these
seemed
to
fly
with
incredible
rapidity
the
teacher
on
the
platform
had
sternly
reproved
a
girl
guilty
of
counting
aloud
in
an
agitated
whisper
threatening
instant
expulsion
for
a
repetition
of
such
an
offense
but
with
this
solitary
exception
nobody
transgressed
the
rules
all
sat
quietly
absorbed
in
their
work
and
an
occasional
rustle
of
paper
or
scratch
of
a
pen
were
the
only
sounds
audible
at
precisely
five
minutes
to
ten
the
deity
on
the
platform
sounded
a
bell
and
ordered
papers
to
be
put
together
she
collected
them
handed
them
to
another
mistress
then
without
any
break
proceeded
to
deal
out
the
questions
for
the
next
hour
examination
this
was
in
geography
and
here
winona
was
not
on
such
sure
ground
granted
that
you
are
acquainted
with
certain
rules
in
arithmetic
it
is
always
possible
to
work
out
problems
but
it
needed
more
knowledge
than
she
possessed
to
write
answers
to
the
riddles
that
confronted
her
she
had
never
heard
of
the
iron
gates
could
not
place
alcona
and
altona
was
hazy
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
mourne
mountains
and
utterly
unable
to
draw
an
accurate
map
of
the
balkan
states
she
scored
a
little
on
canada
for
she
had
learnt
north
america
last
term
at
miss
harmon
but
with
australia
and
new
zealand
she
was
imperfectly
acquainted
she
wrote
away
getting
hotter
and
hotter
as
she
realized
her
deficiencies
winding
up
five
minutes
before
the
time
allotted
in
a
flushed
and
decidedly
inky
condition
at
eleven
a
short
interval
was
allowed
and
the
candidates
thankfully
adjourned
outside
in
the
corridor
they
compared
notes
well
of
all
detestable
papers
this
geography
one
is
the
limit
declared
an
aggrieved
voice
it
was
the
girl
who
had
said
that
she
always
mixed
madras
and
bombay
and
who
had
studied
her
up
to
the
last
available
moment
apparently
her
eleventh
hour
industry
had
not
sufficed
to
tide
her
over
her
difficulties
it
was
catchy
in
parts
agreed
the
owner
of
the
swastika
but
i
liked
one
or
two
questions
i
just
happened
to
know
them
so
i
bowled
ahead
that
what
comes
of
wearing
a
mascot
do
crow
too
soon
laughed
the
girl
with
the
fair
pigtail
remember
there
are
four
other
exams
to
follow
your
luck
may
leave
you
at
any
moment
do
mention
more
i
feel
inclined
to
turn
tail
and
run
home
declared
another
there
the
bell
do
give
us
much
time
do
they
now
for
the
torture
chamber
again
brace
your
nerves
i
wonder
if
most
of
them
have
done
better
or
worse
than
i
have
thought
winona
as
she
took
her
seat
once
more
at
no
desk
a
good
many
were
grumbling
but
that
girl
in
the
spectacles
said
nothing
no
more
did
the
one
with
the
red
of
course
they
might
be
feeling
too
agonized
for
words
but
on
the
other
hand
they
might
be
secretly
congratulating
themselves
it
was
not
the
moment
however
for
speculation
as
to
her
progress
the
next
set
of
questions
was
being
distributed
and
she
took
up
her
copy
eagerly
her
heart
fell
as
she
read
it
over
her
knowledge
of
english
history
was
not
very
accurate
and
the
facts
demanded
were
for
the
most
part
exactly
those
which
she
could
not
remember
the
dread
of
failure
loomed
up
large
she
could
only
attempt
about
half
of
the
questions
and
even
in
these
she
was
not
ready
with
dates
then
suddenly
percy
advice
flashed
into
her
mind
write
from
a
romantic
standpoint
and
make
your
paper
sound
poetical
it
seemed
rather
a
forlorn
hope
and
she
feared
it
would
scarcely
satisfy
her
examiners
but
in
such
a
desperate
situation
anything
was
worth
trying
winona
possessed
a
certain
facility
in
essay
writing
prose
composition
had
been
her
favorite
lesson
at
miss
harmon
she
collected
her
wits
now
and
did
the
very
utmost
of
which
she
was
capable
in
the
matter
of
style
choosing
question
no
write
a
life
of
lady
jane
grey
she
proceeded
to
treat
the
subject
in
as
a
manner
as
possible
the
pathetic
tragedy
of
the
young
queen
had
always
appealed
to
her
imagination
and
she
could
have
had
no
more
congenial
a
theme
upon
which
to
write
if
she
had
been
given
free
choice
of
all
the
characters
in
the
history
book
the
gods
love
die
young
she
began
and
paused
it
seemed
an
excellent
opening
if
she
could
only
continue
in
the
same
strain
but
what
ought
to
come
next
her
thoughts
flew
to
a
painting
of
lady
jane
grey
which
she
had
once
seen
at
a
loan
collection
of
tudor
portraits
why
should
she
not
describe
it
her
pen
flew
rapidly
as
she
wrote
a
of
the
sweet
pale
face
so
round
and
childish
in
spite
of
its
earnest
expression
the
smooth
yellow
hair
the
gray
eyes
bent
demurely
over
the
book
her
heroine
seemed
beginning
to
live
now
for
her
surroundings
a
year
ago
winona
had
paid
a
visit
to
hampton
court
and
her
remembrance
of
its
associations
was
still
keen
and
vivid
she
described
its
garden
by
the
side
of
the
thames
where
the
little
king
edward
vi
must
often
have
roamed
with
his
pretty
cousin
jane
the
two
wonderful
children
playing
for
a
brief
hour
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
the
fate
that
faced
them
what
did
they
talk
about
she
asked
as
they
stood
on
the
paved
terrace
and
watched
the
river
hurrying
by
plato
perchance
and
his
philosophy
or
the
marvelous
with
woodcuts
of
foreign
beasts
that
had
been
specially
printed
for
the
young
king
use
did
they
compare
notes
about
their
tutors
jane
would
certainly
hold
a
brief
for
her
elmer
who
in
sharp
contrast
to
her
parents
severity
taught
her
so
gently
and
patiently
that
she
grudged
the
time
which
was
not
spent
in
his
presence
edward
might
bemoan
the
of
his
who
had
to
bear
the
floggings
which
court
etiquette
denied
to
the
royal
shoulders
and
perhaps
would
declare
that
when
he
was
grown
up
and
could
make
the
laws
himself
no
children
should
be
beaten
for
badly
said
lessons
and
jane
would
agree
with
him
and
then
they
would
pick
the
red
damask
roses
that
cardinal
wolsey
had
planted
and
walk
back
under
the
shadow
of
the
clipped
yew
hedge
to
eat
cherries
and
junket
in
the
room
that
looked
out
towards
the
sunset
winona
had
warmed
to
her
work
her
imagination
always
her
strongest
faculty
completely
carried
her
away
she
pictured
her
heroine
life
not
from
the
outside
as
historians
would
chronicle
it
a
mere
string
of
events
and
dates
but
from
the
inner
view
of
a
girl
standpoint
did
jane
wish
to
leave
her
plato
for
the
bustle
of
a
court
did
she
care
for
the
gay
young
husband
forced
upon
her
by
her
ambitious
parents
surely
for
her
gentle
nature
a
crown
held
few
allurements
the
clouds
were
gathering
thick
and
fast
and
burst
in
a
waterspout
of
utter
ruin
jane
courage
was
calm
and
hopeful
as
that
of
socrates
in
the
dialogues
she
had
loved
your
soul
was
pure
and
true
the
good

in
your
horoscope

quoted
winona
enthusiastically
browning
always
stirred
her
blood
and
threw
her
into
poetical
channels
she
cast
about
in
her
mind
for
any
other
appropriate
verses
ah
broken
is
the
golden
bowl
the
spirit
gone
for
ever
let
the
bell
toll
a
saintly
soul
floats
on
the
stygian

the

song

queenliest
dead
that
ever

so
young
a
dirge
for
her
the
doubly
dead
in
that
she
died
so
young
so
they
finished
their
foul
deed
and
laid
her
to
rest

winona
the
earthly
part
that
is
which
perishes

the

part

winona
glanced
anxiously
at
the
clock
as
with
a
hard
breath
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
laid
down
her
pen
her
theme
had
taken
her
so
long
that
she
had
only
ten
minutes
left
for
the
other
questions
there
was
no
romantic
side
to
be
expressed
in
these
so
she
scribbled
away
her
uncertain
memory
which
had
readily
supplied
quotations
from
browning
or
edgar
allan
poe
struck
altogether
when
asked
for
such
sordid
details
as
the
names
of
the
cabal
ministry
or
the
history
of
the
long
parliament
the
bell
rang
and
left
her
with
her
paper
only
half
finished
at
one
the
candidates
were
given
an
hour
rest
and
a
hot
lunch
was
served
to
them
in
the
at
two
they
returned
to
their
desks
and
the
examination
continued
until
four
winona
found
the
questions
tolerable
she
did
fairly
but
not
at
all
brilliantly
her
brains
were
not
accustomed
to
such
efforts
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
a
neuralgic
headache
began
and
sent
sharp
throbs
of
pain
across
her
forehead
it
was
so
irksome
to
write
pages
of
latin
or
french
verbs
she
had
to
summon
all
her
courage
to
make
herself
do
it
the
last
hour
seemed
an
interminable
penance
at
four
rather
dispirited
candidates
filed
from
the
room
well
thank
goodness
it
over
i
never
want
to
write
another
word
in
my
life
my
hand
stiff
with
cramp
exclaimed
the
girl
with
the
red
to
a
sympathetic
audience
in
the
passage
it
was
awful
i
did
answer
half
the
questions
my
swastika
worth
its
salt
i
shall
give
it
away
mourned
the
owner
of
the
mascot
they
expected
us
to
know
so
very
much
we
should
be
absolute
encyclopaedias
if
we
had
all
that
pat
off
at
our
fingers
ends
sighed
the
girl
with
the
fair
pigtail
how
did
you
get
on
winona
asked
the
girl
who
was
wiping
her
spectacles
nervously
oh
i
do
know
it
so
hard
to
tell
i
answered
most
of
the
questions
but
of
course
i
ca
say
whether
they
right
or
wrong
was
the
latin
translation
just
too
horrible
i
yearned
for
a
dictionary
and
some
of
the
french
grammar
questions
were
absolute
catches
we
went
on
too
long
said
winona
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
spread
the
exam
over
two
days
do
you
think
so
i
rather
have
death
myself
it
such
a
relief
to
feel
it
finished
it
would
be
wretched
to
have
to
begin
again
i
hardly
slept
a
wink
last
night
for
thinking
about
it
i
going
to
try
and
forget
it
now
winona
nodded
to
her
fellow
candidates
and
took
her
leave
how
many
of
them
would
she
see
again
she
wondered
and
which
among
all
the
number
would
have
the
luck
certainly
not
myself
she
thought
ruefully
i
know
my
papers
up
to
standard
i
believe
that
girl
will
be
one
she
looked
clever
winona
had
spent
the
preceding
night
with
aunt
harriet
who
offered
to
keep
her
until
the
result
of
the
examination
should
be
published
but
the
prospect
of
spending
a
week
of
suspense
at
abbey
close
was
so
formidable
that
she
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
return
home
excusing
herself
on
the
plea
that
she
would
like
to
be
with
percy
during
the
remainder
of
his
holidays
it
was
a
very
subdued
winona
who
reached
highfield
next
afternoon
hello
tiddleywinks
you
lost
the
starch
out
of
you
percy
greeted
her
did
they
say
they
would
have
you
at
any
price
the
result
wo
be
out
till
the
fifteenth
but
i
expect
i
failed
answered
winona
gloomily
buck
up
young
look
at
yours
truly
i
fail
nine
times
out
of
ten
and
do
i
take
it
to
heart
winona
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
percy
complacency
over
small
achievements
was
proverbial
but
she
had
higher
ambitions
and
the
cloud
of
depression
soon
settled
down
again
her
temper
not
always
her
strong
point
displayed
a
degree
of
irritability
that
drove
her
family
to
the
verge
of
mutiny
really
winona
i
do
remember
you
so
fractious
since
you
were
cutting
your
teeth
complained
her
mother
the
days
dragged
slowly
by
winona
had
never
before
realized
that
each
hour
could
hold
so
many
minutes
on
the
morning
of
the
she
came
down
to
breakfast
with
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
put
out
of
my
misery
she
thought
as
the
postman
sounded
at
the
door
mamie
made
a
rush
for
the
and
returned
bearing
a
foolscap
envelope
addressed
to
miss
winona
woodward
highfield
ashbourne
nr
great
marston
winona
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
but
as
she
read
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
i
have
much
pleasure
in
informing
you
so
ran
the
letter
that
the
governors
of
the
seaton
high
school
have
decided
to
award
you
a
scholarship
tenable
for
two
years
in
silence
she
passed
the
paper
to
her
mother
congratulations
dear
child
cried
woodward
clapping
her
hands
it
the
unexpected
that
happens
oh
my
goodness
ejaculated
percy
you
never
mean
to
tell
me
that
tiddleywinks
has
actually
been
and
gone
and
won
chapter
iii
seaton
high
school
the
autumn
term
at
seaton
high
school
began
on
september
on
the
winona
set
forth
with
great
flourish
of
trumpets
feeling
more
or
less
of
a
heroine
to
have
been
selected
for
a
scholarship
among
candidates
was
a
distinction
that
even
aunt
harriet
would
admit
in
the
brief
interval
pending
her
departure
her
home
circle
had
treated
her
with
a
respect
they
had
never
before
accorded
her
i
hope
you
do
well
child
said
her
mother
half
proud
and
half
tearful
when
it
came
to
the
parting
we
shall
miss
you
here
but
when
you
get
on
yourself
you
must
help
the
younger
ones
i
shall
look
to
you
to
push
them
on
in
life
there
is
a
certain
satisfaction
in
the
knowledge
that
you
are
considered
the
prop
of
the
family
winona
eyes
glowed
in
imagination
she
was
already
principal
of
a
large
school
and
providing
posts
as
assistant
mistresses
for
letty
mamie
and
doris
that
is
to
say
unless
she
turned
her
attention
to
medicine
but
in
that
case
she
could
be
head
of
a
women
hospital
and
have
them
as
house
surgeons
or
dispensers
or
something
else
equally
distinguished
and
profitable
it
might
even
be
possible
to
provide
occupation
for
godfrey
or
ernie
though
this
was
likely
to
prove
a
tougher
job
than
placing
the
girls
with
such
a
brilliant
beginning
the
future
seemed
an
easy
woodward
was
exulting
over
the
fact
that
she
had
engaged
miss
jones
when
she
did
and
that
winona
school
clothes
were
all
made
and
finished
there
had
been
a
fluster
at
the
last
when
it
was
discovered
that
her
mackintosh
was
fully
six
inches
too
short
for
her
new
skirts
and
that
she
had
outgrown
her
thick
boots
but
a
hurried
visit
to
great
marston
had
remedied
these
deficiencies
and
the
box
was
packed
to
everybody
satisfaction
there
was
a
universal
feeling
in
the
family
that
such
an
outfit
could
not
fail
to
meet
with
aunt
harriet
approval
the
first
sight
of
the
nightdress
case
and
the
bag
must
wring
admiration
from
her
they
had
been
bought
at
a
bazaar
and
were
altogether
superior
to
those
in
daily
use
as
for
the
handkerchief
case
letty
had
decided
that
unless
one
equally
well
embroidered
were
presented
to
her
on
her
next
birthday
she
would
be
obliged
to
assert
her
individuality
by
showing
temper
winona
walked
into
the
of
the
high
school
on
september
with
a
mixture
of
shyness
and
importance
on
the
whole
the
latter
predominated
it
was
a
trifle
embarrassing
to
face
so
many
strangers
but
it
was
something
to
have
won
a
scholarship
she
wondered
who
was
the
other
fortunate
candidate
i
expect
it
will
be
that
girl
with
the
spectacles
she
thought
i
believe
she
answered
every
question
though
she
was
rather
quiet
about
it
she
looked
round
but
could
not
see
the
ruddy
locks
nor
indeed
any
of
the
companions
who
had
taken
the
examination
with
her
hunting
for
some
one
you
know
asked
a
girl
who
had
appropriated
the
next
hook
to
hers
yes
at
least
i
not
sure
whether
she
be
here
or
not
i
believe
her
name
marjorie
kaye
never
heard
of
her
there
are
heaps
of
new
girls
volunteered
another
who
stood
by
i
wondered
if
she
won
a
county
scholarship
added
winona
ask
me
a
harder
i
tell
you
i
never
heard
her
name
before
i
won
the
other
scholarship
winona
voice
was
intended
to
sound
very
casual
indeed
her
neighbor
was
taking
off
her
boots
and
did
not
seem
as
much
impressed
as
the
occasion
merited
oh
so
you
one
of
the
sniggered
another
it
a
sort
of
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
compel
them
to
come
business
i
suppose
we
shall
be
having
council
school
scholarships
next
drawled
a
third
they
were
friends
and
went
off
together
without
another
glance
at
winona
she
followed
soberly
wondering
what
she
ought
to
do
next
she
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
winner
of
a
scholarship
should
present
herself
at
the
head
mistress
study
to
receive
a
few
words
of
encouragement
and
congratulation
on
her
success
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
met
the
mistress
who
had
presided
over
the
examination
the
latter
greeted
her
unceremoniously
winona
woodward
you
been
placed
in
first
room
to
the
right
round
the
corner
you
find
the
number
on
the
door
other
girls
were
hurrying
in
the
same
direction
winona
entered
with
what
seemed
to
her
quite
a
small
crowd
everybody
appeared
to
know
where
to
go
except
herself
she
stood
in
such
evident
hesitation
that
one
more
than
the
rest
remarked
you
better
seize
on
any
desk
you
fancy
as
quick
as
you
can
getting
taken
up
fast
if
you
want
a
front
one
winona
slid
into
the
nearest
seat
at
hand
and
appropriated
it
by
placing
her
ruler
atlas
and
dictionaries
inside
the
desk
the
room
was
filling
quickly
every
moment
fresh
arrivals
hurried
in
and
took
their
places
marjorie
kaye
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
in
the
second
row
sat
the
girl
with
the
red
ribbon
in
her
hair
she
turned
round
and
nodded
pleasantly
so
she
got
the
other
scholarship
thought
winona
i
should
have
expected
it
i
have
staked
my
reputation
on
the
one
well
i
suppose
her
answers
were
correct
after
all
i
rather
glad
on
the
whole
it
this
girl
she
looks
jolly
at
that
moment
miss
huntley
the
form
mistress
entered
and
took
the
and
the
day
work
began
each
girl
was
given
a
and
a
list
of
the
books
she
would
require
and
after
that
class
succeeded
class
until
one
with
a
ten
minutes
interval
for
lunch
at
eleven
the
conclusion
of
the
morning
left
winona
with
a
profound
respect
for
high
school
methods
after
the
routine
of
miss
harmon
it
was
like
stepping
into
a
new
educational
world
she
supposed
she
would
be
able
to
keep
pace
with
it
when
she
got
her
books
but
the
mathematics
at
any
rate
were
much
more
advanced
than
what
she
had
before
attempted
as
she
walked
down
the
corridor
the
girl
with
the
red
overtook
her
and
claimed
acquaintance
so
you
winona
woodward
and
i
garnet
emerson
we
had
the
luck
after
all
i
sure
i
never
expected
to
win
it
was
the
greatest
surprise
to
me
when
the
letter
arrived
yes
five
of
the
other
candidates
are
at
school
but
they
been
put
in
and
marjorie
kaye
you
mean
that
girl
in
spectacles
no
she
not
come
i
heard
her
say
that
if
she
did
win
she
was
to
be
sent
somewhere
else
where
are
you
staying
with
an
aunt
i
with
a
second
cousin
she
nice
but
i
wish
they
open
a
hostel
it
would
be
topping
to
be
with
a
heap
of
others
would
it
we
get
up
acting
in
the
evenings
and
all
sorts
of
fun
well
perhaps
that
may
come
later
on
i
shall
see
you
this
afternoon
sha
i
yes
i
coming
for
my
books
it
too
late
to
stop
and
get
them
now
afternoon
attendance
at
the
high
school
was
not
nominally
compulsory
all
the
principal
subjects
were
taken
in
the
morning
but
there
were
classes
for
drawing
singing
or
physical
culture
from
two
until
four
and
practically
very
few
girls
had
more
than
one
free
afternoon
in
a
week
any
who
liked
might
do
preparation
in
their
own
form
room
and
many
availed
themselves
of
the
permission
especially
those
who
came
from
a
distance
and
stayed
for
dinner
at
the
school
when
winona
first
examined
her
she
had
not
considered
its
demands
excessively
formidable
but
before
she
had
been
a
week
at
seaton
she
began
to
realize
that
she
would
have
very
few
spare
moments
to
call
her
own
miss
bishop
believed
in
girls
being
fully
occupied
and
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
form
work
expected
every
one
to
take
part
in
the
games
and
in
the
numerous
societies
and
guilds
which
had
been
instituted
winona
found
that
she
was
required
to
join
the
debating
club
and
the
patriotic
knitting
guild
while
a
dramatic
society
and
a
literary
association
would
be
prepared
to
open
their
doors
to
her
if
she
proved
worthy
of
admission
so
far
however
she
considered
that
she
had
enough
on
her
hands
the
demands
of
her
new
life
were
almost
overwhelming
and
she
lived
from
day
to
day
in
a
whirl
of
fresh
experiences
it
took
her
some
time
even
to
grasp
the
names
of
the
seventeen
other
girls
in
her
form
audrey
redfern
her
neighbor
was
friendly
but
olave
parry
at
the
desk
in
front
ignored
her
very
existence
she
gathered
that
audrey
like
herself
was
a
while
olave
had
attended
the
school
since
its
foundation
but
she
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
in
the
difference
of
their
behavior
to
her
the
fact
was
that
the
three
new
girls
in
the
form
were
on
probation
the
others
who
had
come
up
from
the
lower
school
and
were
well
versed
in
the
traditions
of
the
place
were
not
willing
to
admit
them
too
quickly
into
favor
they
talked
them
over
in
private
audrey
redfern
seems
a
decent
enough
little
soul
said
estelle
harrison
there
really
nothing
offensive
about
her
to
my
mind
garnet
emerson
i
rather
like
i
fancy
she
could
be
jolly
i
going
to
speak
to
her
in
a
day
or
two
but
not
too
soon
what
do
you
think
of
winona
woodward
queried
bessie
kirk
much
too
big
an
opinion
of
herself
began
bragging
about
her
scholarship
first
thing
she
needs
sitting
upon
to
my
mind
she
pretty
yes
and
she
knows
it
too
well
she
ca
help
knowing
it
i
call
her
most
striking
looking
her
eyes
are
lovely
though
i
never
can
make
out
whether
they
dark
gray
or
hazel
under
those
long
lashes
her
hair
just
the
color
of
bronze
and
such
a
lot
of
it
it
beats
joyce
newton
hollow
besides
joyce
has
absolutely
white
eyelashes
like
a
pig
laughed
hilda
langley
i
agree
with
you
that
pretty
but
i
do
think
she
ever
be
a
chum
of
mine
all
the
same
the
result
of
the
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
rest
of
the
form
was
the
cementing
of
a
close
friendship
between
winona
and
garnet
it
seemed
natural
for
the
holders
of
the
two
county
scholarships
to
become
chums
also
they
found
each
other
society
congenial
it
marked
a
new
epoch
for
winona
she
had
had
few
friends
of
her
own
age
she
had
been
the
eldest
pupil
at
miss
harmon
small
school
and
her
sisters
were
so
much
younger
than
herself
that
their
interests
were
on
a
different
plane
to
her
own
garnet
with
her
merry
brown
eyes
eager
and
enthusiastic
nature
and
amusing
tongue
seemed
a
revelation
the
two
girls
spent
every
available
moment
together
and
soon
waxed
confidential
on
the
subject
of
their
home
affairs
we
all
named
after
precious
stones
said
garnet
pearl
my
eldest
sister
is
classics
mistress
at
a
school
jacinthe
is
studying
for
a
health
visitor
ruby
is
at
a
horticultural
college
and
beryl
is
secretary
at
a
settlement
are
there
a
lot
of
us
all
girls
too
and
not
a
single
brother
i
the
baby
of
the
family
i
like
to
go
to
holloway
if
i
can
get
a
scholarship
but
that
remains
to
be
seen
meanwhile
two
years
at
the
high
not
so
bad
is
it
i
expect
i
going
to
enjoy
it
are
you
yes
perhaps
if
the
rest
of
the
form
were
nicer
i
might
oh
they
come
round
we
ca
expect
them
to
take
us
to
their
bosoms
straight
off
we
goods
on
approval
we
as
much
right
here
as
they
have
grunted
winona
but
they
were
here
first
and
of
course
that
always
counts
for
something
we
shall
have
to
show
that
we
worth
our
salt
before
we
get
any
footing
in
the
form
the
question
is
how
best
to
do
it
winona
shook
her
head
it
was
beyond
her
comprehension
i
had
a
few
tips
from
jacinthe
ruminated
garnet
she
was
captain
the
last
year
she
was
at
school
so
she
ought
to
know
you
see
we
to
steer
between
scylla
and
charybdis
we
must
push
ourselves
forward
too
violently
or
they
call
us
cheeky
but
on
the
other
hand
if
we
content
to
take
a
back
seat
we
may
stay
there
for
the
rest
of
the
term
comprenez
vous
it
a
matter
of
seizing
one
chance
i
an
idea
floating
about
in
my
mind
do
you
happen
to
be
anything
extra
special
at
singing
or
reciting
or
acting
i
have
had
much
practice
at
acting
but
i
can
play
the
guitar
mummie
taught
me
she
lived
in
spain
for
three
years
when
she
was
a
girl
and
learnt
there
the
very
thing
how
perfectly
splendid
i
play
the
mandoline
myself
and
the
two
go
so
well
together
did
you
bring
your
guitar
with
you
no
i
did
think
i
should
have
any
time
for
it
but
you
could
write
for
it
could
you
oh
yes
mummie
would
send
it
to
me
well
this
is
my
idea
you
know
next
week
there
to
be
a
big
general
meeting
of
the
whole
school
to
choose
a
games
captain
so
far
the
games
department
here
is
rather
in
its
infancy
i
been
making
enquiries
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
form
trophy
there
certainly
ought
to
be
to
spur
on
enthusiasm
i
going
to
pluck
up
my
courage
tackle
one
or
two
members
of
the
sixth
and
suggest
that
after
the
meeting
we
hold
a
and
take
a
collection
to
provide
a
form
trophy
i
believe
anybody
ever
thought
of
it
ripping
but
what
exactly
is
a
oh
just
an
informal
concert
i
thought
if
you
and
i
played
the
mandoline
and
guitar
together
it
would
make
a
good
item
i
see
two
of
the
prefects
coming
along
over
there
i
believe
i
go
and
ask
them
i
admire
your
courage
garnet
returned
in
a
few
minutes
tolerably
well
satisfied
with
her
mission
i
believe
the
idea
will
catch
on
she
announced
of
course
i
expect
them
to
say
immediately
they
were
very
cautious
and
said
they
would
put
it
to
the
form
i
sown
the
seed
at
any
rate
and
we
must
wait
for
developments
apparently
garnet
proposition
proved
acceptable
to
the
sixth
for
the
very
next
day
a
notice
was
pinned
on
the
board
in
the
hall
there
will
be
a
general
meeting
of
the
school
on
tuesday
october
at
for
the
purpose
of
electing
a
games
captain
the
meeting
will
be
followed
by
a
symposium
when
a
collection
will
be
taken
the
proceeds
of
which
will
be
devoted
to
the
purchase
of
a
form
trophy
performers
kindly
submit
their
names
without
delay
to
howell
as
the
program
is
being
made
up
garnet
was
one
of
the
first
to
read
the
notice
and
she
started
off
at
once
to
the
sixth
form
room
she
sought
out
winona
on
her
return
so
my
little
scheme
come
off
she
beamed
you
bet
the
sixth
will
take
all
the
credit
for
evolving
it
but
i
do
care
i
put
our
names
down
for
a
mandoline
and
guitar
duet
and
said
we
be
ready
to
help
with
any
accompaniments
they
like
meg
howell
just
jumped
at
that
it
seems
patricia
marshall
and
clarice
nixon
are
going
to
sing
a
christy
minstrel
song
and
she
thought
our
instruments
would
add
to
the
effect
no
end
i
tell
you
we
shall
score
did
you
write
for
your
guitar
yes
i
expect
it
will
be
sent
off
then
we
must
begin
and
practice
i
got
a
topping
duet
that
quite
easy
can
you
come
home
with
me
after
school
for
half
an
hour
or
so
i
know
my
cousins
will
be
glad
to
see
you
then
we
might
try
over
one
or
two
things
and
see
how
they
go
it
will
be
all
right
if
i
tell
aunt
harriet
i
shall
be
late
agreed
winona
the
instrument
arrived
the
same
evening
so
she
was
able
to
keep
her
promise
to
garnet
next
day
fortunately
they
had
only
one
class
that
afternoon
and
were
able
to
leave
school
at
three
cousins
lived
within
a
short
tramcar
ride
they
were
musical
people
and
sympathized
with
her
project
garnet
led
winona
into
the
and
began
without
waste
of
time
let
me
look
at
your
guitar
oh
what
a
beauty
what
the
label
inside
juan
da
costa
seville
then
it
must
be
spanish
i
suppose
they
the
best
my
mandoline
italian
it
was
made
in
milan
we
must
tune
them
together
must
we
can
you
read
well
this
is
the
book
of
duets
i
thought
this
barcarolle
would
be
easy
it
has
such
a
lovely
swing
about
it
here
the
guitar
part
chapter
iv
the
symposium
by
the
aid
of
diligent
practicing
in
private
and
several
rehearsals
at
garnet
house
the
girls
at
last
got
their
duet
to
run
smoothly
garnet
was
frankly
pleased
the
two
instruments
go
so
nicely
together
a
mandoline
ever
so
much
better
played
with
a
guitar
accompaniment
than
with
the
piano
i
say
suppose
we
were
to
get
an
encore
i
do
suppose
anything
of
the
sort
do
be
too
modest
it
as
well
to
be
prepared
i
not
going
to
practice
anything
more
so
i
warn
you
well
take
something
you
know
from
your
own
book
this
song
i
could
play
the
air
very
softly
on
the
mandoline
and
we
both
sing
it
that
wo
give
you
any
extra
trouble
it
is
the
trouble
so
much
as
the
state
of
my
fingers
getting
sore
if
i
let
a
blister
come
i
sha
be
able
to
play
at
all
then
for
goodness
sake
do
play
any
more
and
soak
your
fingers
in
alum
when
you
get
home
the
general
meeting
on
tuesday
was
a
very
important
event
for
it
marked
the
opening
of
the
winter
session
of
games
and
guilds
during
the
first
week
or
ten
days
of
the
autumn
term
the
girls
had
enough
to
do
in
settling
into
the
work
of
their
new
forms
but
now
october
was
come
everybody
began
to
think
about
hockey
and
to
consider
the
advisability
of
beginning
rehearsals
for
various
christmas
performances
i
always
hate
the
end
of
september
proclaimed
grace
olliver
it
so
fine
and
the
geraniums
are
still
so
fresh
in
the
park
that
deceived
into
thinking
it
still
summer
yet
when
you
try
to
play
tennis
you
find
the
courts
horrible
and
you
cut
up
the
grass
in
half
an
hour
i
glad
when
the
leaves
all
come
off
and
you
know
autumn
and
you
look
up
your
hockey
jersey
and
think
what
sport
you
had
last
winter
over
dramatic
i
fond
enough
of
cricket
but
really
rather
have
winter
than
summer
on
the
whole
there
more
going
on
i
glad
margaret
howell
head
of
the
school
replied
evelyn
richards
she
at
all
the
guilds
though
i
do
think
she
much
chance
of
being
elected
games
captain
all
the
better
it
quite
enough
for
margaret
to
act
head
she
good
enough
at
that
i
admit
makes
an
ideal
president
but
a
girl
literary
is
generally
sporty
as
well
it
stands
to
reason
she
do
both
properly
meg
does
want
to
be
games
captain
it
not
in
her
line
volunteered
beatrice
margaret
younger
sister
she
told
me
to
tell
you
all
to
vote
for
kirsty
paterson
kirsty
topping
what
this
symposium
we
to
have
after
the
meeting
asked
grace
why
i
do
exactly
know
laughed
evelyn
i
looked
up
in
the
dictionary
and
it
said
a
drinking
together
a
merry
feast
a
convivial
party
i
do
know
what
we
going
to
drink
unless
we
bring
lemon
kali
and
pass
it
round
like
they
used
to
do
the
loving
cup
in
the
middle
ages
i
suppose
it
be
just
a
kind
of
concert
but
how
about
the
collection
what
are
we
supposed
to
give
anything
you
like
from
a
penny
upwards
replied
beatrice
meg
calculated
that
two
hundred
and
six
pennies
would
be
seventeen
and
twopence
and
some
girls
will
probably
give
more
so
she
thinks
sure
of
a
sovereign
and
that
ought
to
buy
a
decent
trophy
something
to
begin
upon
at
any
rate
one
must
make
a
start
right
you
are
a
penny
wo
break
the
banks
of
even
the
first
form
babes
and
millionaires
can
give
their
if
they
so
disposed
punctually
at
on
the
following
tuesday
the
whole
school
assembled
in
the
gymnasium
no
mistress
was
present
for
on
occasions
such
as
this
miss
bishop
believed
in
she
could
trust
her
head
girl
and
prefects
and
had
armed
them
with
full
authority
winona
anticipated
the
meeting
with
excitement
and
curiosity
it
was
altogether
outside
her
experience
she
had
never
in
her
life
attended
such
a
function
garnet
whose
elder
sisters
had
been
at
large
schools
had
sketched
an
outline
of
what
was
likely
to
take
place
but
even
garnet
information
was
though
she
had
now
been
exactly
a
fortnight
at
seaton
winona
still
felt
more
or
less
of
a
she
had
hardly
spoken
to
any
one
outside
her
own
form
and
knew
the
names
of
comparatively
few
of
her
two
hundred
and
five
schoolfellows
without
garnet
she
would
have
been
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
steer
her
course
in
this
great
ocean
of
school
life
she
thankfully
accepted
her
friend
as
pilot
and
for
the
present
was
content
to
follow
her
lead
the
two
girls
presented
themselves
in
the
gymnasium
in
good
time
and
took
their
seats
among
the
other
members
of
the
front
bench
was
occupied
by
a
row
of
who
had
come
up
this
term
from
the
preparatory
and
who
sat
squeezing
each
others
arms
highly
impressed
with
the
importance
of
their
remove
behind
them
form
a
giggling
crew
rather
more
with
the
ways
of
the
school
effervesced
occasionally
into
excited
squeals
and
were
instantly
suppressed
by
a
prefect
the
third
and
fourth
which
comprised
the
bulk
of
the
girls
from
twelve
to
fifteen
occupied
the
middle
of
the
hall
a
lively
and
rather
obstreperous
set
all
at
that
awkward
age
which
is
anxious
to
claim
privileges
but
not
particularly
ready
to
submit
to
the
authorized
code
every
one
of
them
was
talking
at
the
extreme
pitch
of
her
voice
and
the
noise
was
considerable
patricia
marshall
and
clarice
nixon
looked
at
each
other
and
frowned
ominously
but
as
the
hands
of
the
big
clock
pointed
almost
to
three
they
judged
it
better
not
to
interfere
and
the
din
continued
at
the
stroke
of
the
hour
margaret
howell
strode
on
to
the
platform
she
was
a
tall
girl
of
seventeen
with
bright
hazel
eyes
regular
features
and
a
thick
brown
plait
that
fell
below
her
waist
her
ready
powers
of
speech
clear
ringing
voice
brisk
decisive
tone
and
a
certain
personal
magnetism
showed
her
to
be
that
a
born
leader
it
was
fortunate
indeed
for
the
school
that
its
headship
this
year
should
have
fallen
to
margaret
the
need
for
a
firm
but
judicious
hand
on
the
reins
was
great
during
the
two
previous
years
of
the
school
existence
the
had
been
in
a
state
of
evolution
for
the
first
year
when
everybody
was
new
together
comparatively
little
could
be
done
the
school
must
find
itself
before
it
began
to
form
its
private
code
of
laws
in
the
second
year
had
raised
to
the
post
of
honor
ivy
chatterton
a
clever
but
most
untactful
girl
whose
quick
temper
had
brought
her
into
constant
collision
with
her
prefects
many
were
the
squalls
which
had
swept
over
the
school
of
so
serious
a
nature
sometimes
as
almost
to
wreck
several
of
the
guilds
the
younger
girls
following
the
example
of
their
elders
had
quarreled
hotly
and
indulged
in
an
incredible
amount
of
petty
spite
and
altogether
the
current
tone
had
been
anything
but
desirable
miss
bishop
who
had
seen
to
her
sorrow
this
downward
trend
had
welcomed
the
advent
of
margaret
believing
her
to
have
the
ability
to
cope
with
difficult
situations
and
at
the
same
time
to
have
the
grit
and
not
to
allow
her
head
to
be
turned
by
her
elevation
to
office
you
will
have
a
great
responsibility
i
am
giving
you
unusual
power
and
i
trust
that
you
will
make
the
highest
use
of
it
she
had
said
to
the
girl
during
a
certain
quiet
ten
minutes
talk
in
her
study
and
margaret
had
held
herself
very
straight
and
had
answered
i
do
my
level
best
miss
bishop
all
eyes
were
now
fixed
on
the
head
girl
as
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
platform
ringing
the
bell
for
silence
the
clamor
subsided
as
if
by
magic
and
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
hush
she
began
her
speech
girls
we
been
back
now
for
a
whole
fortnight
time
for
most
of
us
to
shake
down
into
our
places
is
it
the
school
year
fairly
started
and
we
met
together
this
afternoon
to
talk
about
a
number
of
things
that
are
of
very
great
importance
to
us
all
you
all
know
that
a
school
to
be
worth
anything
has
two
sides
there
the
inside
part
with
classes
and
prep
and
what
generally
called
the
that
managed
by
the
mistresses
and
there
the
outside
part
the
games
and
sports
and
concerts
and
guilds
that
run
by
the
girls
themselves
now
i
think
if
we
arrange
well
we
ought
to
be
able
to
look
forward
to
three
very
jolly
terms
everything
depends
upon
making
a
good
start
i
been
getting
to
know
how
they
manage
in
several
other
big
schools
and
i
propose
that
we
frame
our
code
by
theirs
what
we
want
first
of
all
is
a
feeling
of
unity
and
public
spirit
each
girl
must
make
up
her
mind
to
do
all
she
can
to
push
on
the
high
we
want
to
win
matches
and
have
a
good
sports
record
and
generally
build
up
a
reputation
slacking
at
games
must
be
out
of
the
question
everybody
must
buck
up
all
round
those
who
are
playing
themselves
can
show
their
interest
by
attending
the
matches
it
makes
the
greatest
difference
to
an
eleven
to
know
that
their
own
side
is
watching
their
play
and
ready
to
cheer
them
on
there
nothing
so
forlorn
and
depressing
as
to
see
whole
rows
of
the
enemy
school
hats
on
the
spectators
benches
and
only
of
one
own
yet
that
what
happened
when
we
played
harbury
last
spring
no
wonder
we
lost
i
going
to
ask
you
presently
to
elect
a
games
captain
and
then
i
want
you
to
support
her
loyally
for
the
whole
of
the
year
let
her
feel
that
she
can
depend
upon
you
and
that
instead
of
getting
together
scratch
teams
her
difficulty
will
be
how
to
choose
among
so
many
crack
players
but
as
you
know
games
are
not
the
whole
of
our
business
we
have
our
guilds
to
consider
as
well
i
want
to
put
these
upon
a
good
and
firm
basis
last
winter
we
did
quite
know
where
we
were
with
them
did
we
at
present
we
have
dramatic
society
debating
club
literary
association
and
patriotic
knitting
guild
we
might
very
well
add
a
union
and
a
history
league
they
ought
all
to
be
run
on
the
same
lines
each
must
have
a
president
a
secretary
and
a
committee
of
eight
members
who
will
undertake
the
business
of
the
society
and
settle
all
its
events
any
difficulty
or
dispute
must
be
referred
to
the
prefects
meeting
the
decision
of
which
shall
be
final
each
guild
must
draw
up
a
list
of
its
own
rules
these
must
be
submitted
first
to
the
prefects
then
if
passed
as
satisfactory
they
must
be
written
in
the
minutes
book
and
strictly
adhered
to
i
want
you
all
to
realize
that
this
school
is
still
in
its
infancy
it
a
baby
of
only
two
years
but
a
very
promising
baby
it
we
who
are
going
to
make
its
history
so
far
we
ca
say
it
has
had
any
annals
in
the
future
it
must
show
a
whole
splendid
list
of
achievements
and
successes
years
afterwards
when
it
the
most
famous
school
in
the
county
we
shall
be
proud
to
have
had
the
privilege
of
taking
our
share
in
pushing
it
on
and
our
names
may
be
handed
down
to
long
generations
of
girls
as
those
who
founded
its
best
traditions
margaret
paused
quite
out
of
breath
with
her
long
speech
a
storm
of
applause
rose
from
the
audience
the
girls
clapped
and
stamped
a
few
even
cheered
margaret
had
touched
the
right
string
the
idea
of
making
school
history
appealed
to
them
and
they
were
ready
to
respond
with
enthusiasm
to
her
appeal
even
the
were
eager
to
show
their
zeal
winona
had
never
taken
her
eyes
off
the
speaker
it
was
a
new
gospel
to
her
that
she
was
one
of
the
great
community
bound
to
help
the
common
weal
the
realization
of
it
stirred
her
spirit
her
imagination
danced
ahead
and
performed
prodigies
suppose
she
could
do
something
wonderful
for
the
school
and
leave
her
name
as
a
memory
to
others
the
vision
gleamed
golden
it
would
be
worth
living
to
accomplish
that
not
half
a
bad
speech
murmured
garnet
approvingly
by
her
side
winona
started
and
came
back
from
the
clouds
i
think
it
just
immense
she
answered
with
a
long
sigh
of
admiration
margaret
was
again
ringing
the
bell
for
silence
i
glad
to
find
you
all
agree
with
me
she
announced
now
i
want
us
to
get
solidly
to
business
and
elect
a
games
captain
you
remember
i
asked
each
to
nominate
a
candidate
and
i
find
that
more
than
have
handed
in
the
same
name
that
of
kirsty
paterson
i
therefore
put
kirsty
up
for
election
it
only
fair
that
i
should
first
go
over
her
qualifications
for
the
office
she
was
our
best
center
forward
last
year
at
hockey
and
our
best
bowler
at
cricket
she
a
thoroughly
steady
and
reliable
player
herself
and
this
is
most
important
she
able
to
train
others
you
know
from
experience
that
she
fair
and
just
and
she
tremendously
keen
i
feel
sure
that
in
her
hands
the
games
would
prosper
and
we
soon
show
some
improvement
will
all
those
in
favor
of
electing
kirsty
kindly
stand
up
there
was
such
a
general
rising
among
the
girls
that
most
presidents
would
have
considered
the
matter
settled
margaret
however
liked
to
do
things
strictly
in
order
thanks
i
will
you
please
sit
down
again
now
those
against
the
election
kindly
stand
a
certain
section
in
the
school
had
intended
to
vote
against
kirsty
but
when
they
saw
themselves
so
enormously
outnumbered
they
changed
their
minds
to
belong
to
a
minority
often
means
to
be
unpopular
and
it
is
wise
to
go
with
the
stream
after
all
kirsty
was
a
thoroughly
eligible
and
desirable
candidate
so
though
a
few
neighbors
elbowed
each
other
nobody
rose
margaret
waited
a
moment
do
i
understand
that
you
all
in
favor
then
the
motion
is
carried
unanimously
i
very
glad
for
i
think
kirsty
will
make
an
ideal
captain
let
give
three
cheers
for
her
are
you
ready
hooray
the
girls
responded
with
full
lung
power
some
even
began
to
sing
for
she
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
there
was
a
general
outcry
of
speech
speech
the
blushing
kirsty
a
bonny
rosy
athletic
looking
lassie
was
seized
by
her
fellow
prefects
and
dragged
in
spite
of
her
protests
to
the
front
of
the
platform
kirsty
had
been
born
north
of
the
tweed
and
in
moments
of
excitement
her
pretty
scottish
burr
asserted
itself
it
verra
kind
of
you
to
elect
me
she
began
i
afraid
i
no
hand
at
making
speeches
i
preferr
deeds
to
worrds
we
all
put
ourr
shoulderrs
to
the
wheel
and
win
forr
the
school
wo
we
i
hope
have
a
splendid
yearr
at
that
she
retired
amidst
rapturous
applause
margaret
again
rang
the
bell
for
silence
and
proceeded
with
the
business
of
the
meeting
which
was
to
elect
the
officers
for
the
various
societies
and
guilds
this
being
satisfactorily
settled
she
turned
to
affairs
of
lighter
moment
i
sure
you
all
agree
that
it
is
very
desirable
for
us
to
have
a
form
trophy
for
hockey
at
any
rate
perhaps
by
next
summer
we
get
one
for
cricket
as
well
it
will
spur
us
on
to
have
a
little
wholesome
competition
amongst
ourselves
as
i
announced
on
the
notice
board
we
are
now
going
to
give
a
short
entertainment
at
the
close
of
which
a
collection
will
be
taken
for
the
object
i
have
just
mentioned
i
hate
begging
so
give
what
you
like
but
of
course
it
depends
on
your
generosity
this
afternoon
what
kind
of
a
trophy
we
are
able
to
buy
the
first
item
on
our
program
is
a
piano
solo
by
hester
king
hester
was
one
of
the
best
music
pupils
in
the
school
she
had
a
good
crisp
touch
and
considerable
execution
and
led
off
the
concert
with
a
sprightly
tarantella
a
violin
solo
followed
by
sibyl
lee
a
member
of
who
was
rather
nervous
but
acquitted
herself
fairly
well
on
the
whole
i
thought
i
break
down
she
confided
to
her
friends
the
sight
of
all
those
eyes
staring
at
me
quite
put
me
off
i
do
wonder
blind
musicians
are
generally
successes
they
ca
see
the
audience
well
never
mind
i
done
my
bit
at
any
rate
the
next
on
the
list
was
a
song
from
annie
hardy
she
had
chosen
keep
the
home
fires
burning
and
rendered
it
with
great
effect
the
whole
room
joining
with
enthusiasm
in
the
chorus
it
took
so
well
that
there
were
shouts
of
encore
and
annie
came
back
smiling
to
give
khaki
boys
which
roused
her
audience
to
an
even
higher
pitch
of
patriotic
fervor
a
recitation
our
hockey
match
by
agnes
heath
was
felt
to
be
particularly
appropriate
to
the
occasion
it
was
a
very
good
school
piece
humorous
as
well
as
exciting
and
agnes
had
enough
dramatic
ability
to
do
justice
to
it
her
own
form
in
particular
stamped
lustily
the
prefects
motioned
her
forward
again
but
she
shook
her
head
the
clapping
redoubled
agnes
escorted
to
the
front
by
margaret
bowed
and
announced
fearfully
sorry
not
to
oblige
but
this
is
absolutely
the
only
thing
i
know
and
it
too
long
to
say
all
over
again
there
was
a
general
laugh
and
the
audience
settled
itself
to
enjoy
the
next
item
on
the
program
margaret
was
signaling
to
winona
and
garnet
and
the
pair
slipped
from
their
places
and
made
their
way
to
the
platform
i
all
upset
i
hope
i
sha
break
down
whispered
winona
nonsense
a
duet
not
so
bad
as
a
solo
you
get
on
all
right
do
for
goodness
sake
brace
up
implored
garnet
if
you
muddle
your
accompaniment
you
spoil
my
part
you
surely
never
go
and
fail
me
the
instruments
had
been
put
under
the
piano
patricia
marshall
handed
them
forth
and
sounded
the
notes
for
them
to
be
tuned
clarice
nixon
was
placing
chairs
and
garnet
was
tolerably
composed
but
winona
was
suffering
from
a
bad
attack
of
that
most
unpleasant
malady
stage
fright
she
would
have
given
worlds
for
a
trapdoor
in
the
platform
to
open
and
allow
her
to
subside
out
of
sight
no
such
convenient
arrangement
however
had
been
provided
for
the
use
of
bashful
performers
the
planks
were
solid
and
guaranteed
not
to
give
way
under
any
circumstances
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
her
seat
in
full
view
of
the
audience
there
were
slightly
over
two
hundred
girls
in
the
room
but
to
winona
fevered
imagination
there
appeared
to
be
thousands
she
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
had
the
folly
to
place
herself
in
such
a
public
situation
garnet
was
sounding
a
few
notes
and
looking
at
her
to
begin
for
one
dreadful
moment
the
room
whirled
perhaps
margaret
saw
and
understood
she
laid
her
hand
on
winona
shaking
arm
and
whispered
encouragingly
go
on
do
mind
the
audience
just
remember
that
you
playing
for
the
form
trophy
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
swept
over
winona
all
the
school
patriotism
aroused
within
her
by
margaret
speech
surged
up
to
meet
the
crisis
she
was
no
longer
an
isolated
atom
a
girl
fresh
from
home
and
on
trial
before
the
critical
eyes
of
her
new
form
but
a
unit
in
the
great
life
of
the
school
bound
to
play
her
part
for
the
good
of
the
whole
and
specially
pledged
not
to
fail
garnet
in
this
emergency
self
faded
in
the
larger
vision
the
color
flooded
back
into
her
face
she
made
a
desperate
effort
and
struck
the
opening
chords
as
her
friend
had
reminded
her
a
duet
was
quite
a
different
matter
from
a
solo
directly
the
mandoline
part
began
her
confidence
returned
she
tried
to
think
that
she
was
only
playing
an
accompaniment
for
garnet
the
piece
was
not
difficult
it
was
in
d
quite
the
easiest
key
for
the
guitar
with
very
few
accidentals
or
high
positions
she
took
courage
and
struck
her
strings
crisply
so
that
the
tone
rang
out
well
her
instrument
was
a
good
one
very
true
and
mellow
and
her
mother
had
taught
her
the
liquid
spanish
touch
which
showed
it
to
its
best
advantage
garnet
also
was
doing
her
best
her
plectrum
vibrated
evenly
and
rapidly
and
the
metallic
twang
her
gravest
fault
was
not
nearly
so
evident
as
usual
the
audience
unfamiliar
with
these
particular
instruments
was
not
hypercritical
and
so
long
as
the
players
kept
well
together
and
sounded
no
discords
their
skill
was
judged
to
be
excellent
the
barcarolle
had
an
attractive
swing
about
it
and
a
romantic
suggestion
of
gondolas
and
lapping
water
and
moonlight
serenades
as
the
last
notes
of
the
air
on
the
mandoline
died
away
winona
swept
her
thumb
over
the
strings
of
her
guitar
in
a
tremendous
final
chord
it
had
quite
a
magnificent
and
professional
effect
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
applause
it
was
simply
clamorous
stand
up
and
bow
whispered
margaret
nudging
the
unaccustomed
performers
that
right
bow
again
it
most
clearly
an
encore
have
you
brought
anything
else
with
you
good
biz
do
waste
any
more
time
then
we
rather
late
the
song
that
winona
had
chosen
was
a
bright
little
irish
ditty
with
a
catchy
tune
and
lively
accompaniment
garnet
played
the
air
softly
on
the
mandoline
and
the
two
girls
sang
in
unison
keeping
strictly
together
and
pronouncing
very
plainly
so
that
the
point
of
the
amusing
words
should
not
be
lost
the
audience
shrieked
with
laughter
and
would
have
demanded
a
further
encore
had
not
margaret
pointed
to
the
clock
and
shaken
her
head
firmly
there
were
other
items
on
the
program
and
time
was
going
all
too
fast
another
violin
solo
a
recitation
and
a
highland
fling
followed
then
the
concert
wound
up
with
a
christy
minstrel
song
from
several
members
of
the
sixth
this
last
was
the
triumph
of
the
afternoon
patricia
prided
herself
on
her
preparations
she
had
placed
a
newspaper
inside
the
grand
piano
over
the
strings
and
when
the
hammers
struck
against
it
the
effect
of
the
accompaniment
was
exactly
that
of
a
banjo
she
had
borrowed
two
sets
of
castanets
a
pair
of
cymbals
and
a
triangle
and
with
these
instruments
she
and
her
companions
emphasized
the
chorus
garnet
and
winona
helped
with
mandoline
and
guitar
so
the
general
result
was
quite
orchestral
during
the
performance
of
this
some
of
the
prefects
went
round
with
collecting
bags
which
were
passed
along
the
benches
come
my
honey
and
help
to
spend
my
money
chanted
the
minstrels
lustily
and
the
audience
smiled
at
the
appropriateness
of
the
words
it
was
felt
that
the
symposium
had
been
an
enormous
success
the
girls
were
quite
loath
to
leave
and
dispersed
slowly
from
the
gymnasium
many
eyes
were
turned
on
winona
and
garnet
as
they
carried
their
instruments
down
from
the
platform
who
are
they
every
one
was
asking
for
so
far
their
names
were
not
known
outside
their
own
form
the
two
county
scholarship
holders
somebody
replied
and
the
information
was
passed
on
next
morning
margaret
proudly
posted
up
the
result
of
the
collection
which
amounted
to
a
very
substantial
sum
in
the
estimation
of
the
school
it
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
buy
a
cup
she
triumphed
miss
bishop
has
promised
to
send
for
some
catalogues
so
that
we
can
look
up
the
prices

shall
start

season

any
rate

answered
winona
chapter
v
aunt
harriet
it
is
high
time
now
that
we
paused
to
consider
a
very
important
person
indeed
in
this
story
namely
miss
harriet
beach
but
for
whose
invitation
winona
would
never
have
attended
seaton
high
school
at
all
aunt
harriet
was
what
is
generally
known
as
a
character
that
is
to
say
she
was
possessed
of
a
strong
personality
and
was
decidedly
eccentric
though
her
age
verged
on
sixty
she
preserved
the
energy
of
her
thirties
and
prided
herself
upon
her
physical
fitness
she
was
tall
with
a
high
color
keen
brown
eyes
a
large
nose
a
determined
mouth
and
iron
gray
hair
in
her
youth
she
must
have
been
handsome
and
even
now
her
erect
figure
and
dark
eyebrows
gave
her
a
certain
air
of
distinction
she
was
a
most
thoroughly
capable
woman
reliable
and
strongly
philanthropic
not
in
a
sentimental
way
however
she
disapproved
of
indiscriminate
almsgiving
and
would
have
considered
it
a
crime
to
bestow
a
penny
on
a
beggar
without
making
a
proper
investigation
of
his
case
she
was
a
tower
of
strength
to
most
of
the
charitable
institutions
in
the
city
a
terror
to
the
professional
pauper
but
a
real
friend
to
the
deserving
her
time
was
much
occupied
with
committees
secretarial
duties
district
visiting
workhouse
inspection
and
other
public
interests
she
was
apt
indeed
to
have
more
than
her
share
of
civic
business
her
reputation
for
absolute
reliability
caused
people
to
get
into
the
habit
of
saying
oh
go
to
miss
beach
on
every
occasion
and
as
she
invariably
proved
the
willing
horse
she
justified
the
proverb
and
received
the
work
in
increased
proportions
like
most
people
aunt
harriet
had
her
faults
she
was
apt
to
be
a
trifle
overbearing
and
domineering
she
lacked
patience
with
weaknesses
and
was
too
doctrinaire
in
her
views
she
tried
very
hard
to
push
the
world
along
but
she
forgot
sometimes
that
the
mills
of
god
grind
slowly
and
that
it
is
only
after
much
waiting
and
many
days
that
the
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
returns
to
us
she
prided
herself
on
her
candor
and
lack
of
humbug
unfortunately
people
who
speak
their
minds
generally
treat
their
hearers
to
a
sample
of
their
worst
instead
of
their
best
and
their
excessive
truthfulness
scarcely
meets
with
the
gratitude
they
consider
it
deserves
miss
beach
many
estimable
qualities
however
overbalanced
her
crudities
her
friends
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
told
each
other
it
was
her
way
her
heart
was
all
right
though
she
might
give
offense
people
forgot
it
and
came
to
her
again
next
time
they
wanted
anything
done
and
the
universal
verdict
was
that
she
was
trying
at
times
but
on
the
whole
one
of
the
most
useful
citizens
which
seaton
possessed
if
there
was
one
person
more
than
another
who
wore
out
miss
patience
it
was
her
niece
and
goddaughter
woodward
she
had
a
sincere
affection
for
her
but
their
two
personalities
were
at
absolutely
opposite
poles
she
admitted
that
florita
was
amiable
and
thoroughly
affectionate
but
for
the
rest
she
considered
her
weak
foolishly
helpless
liable
to
extravagance
a
poor
housekeeper
and
a
perfect
in
her
methods
of
bringing
up
her
family
in
vain
did
aunt
harriet
on
successive
visits
preach
firmness
order
consistency
and
other
maternal
virtues
her
niece
would
brace
herself
up
to
a
temporary
effort
but
would
relax
again
directly
her
guest
had
departed
and
the
children
little
rogues
discovered
at
a
remarkably
early
age
that
they
could
do
pretty
much
as
they
liked
the
woodwards
always
dreaded
the
advent
of
aunt
harriet
her
disapproval
of
their
general
conduct
was
so
manifest
by
dint
of
urging
from
their
mother
they
made
extra
attempts
at
good
behavior
before
the
august
visitor
but
they
were
subject
to
awful
relapses
woodward
on
her
side
considered
she
had
her
trials
for
her
aunt
had
a
habit
of
arriving
suddenly
giving
only
a
few
hours
notice
by
telegram
and
she
could
not
forbear
the
suspicion
that
her
revered
godparent
wished
to
surprise
her
housekeeping
and
catch
her
unprepared
on
one
occasion
indeed
when
the
family
came
down
rather
late
for
breakfast
aunt
harriet
was
discovered
sitting
on
the
rustic
seat
outside
the
window
she
explained
that
she
had
taken
the
workmen
train
and
had
come
to
spend
a
long
day
with
them
but
not
wishing
to
disturb
the
house
at
too
early
an
hour
she
had
remained
in
the
garden
enjoying
the
view
until
somebody
arrived
downstairs
in
spite
of
her
rather
angular
attitude
miss
beach
was
a
very
kind
and
generous
friend
to
her
widowed
niece
and
she
was
the
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
woodward
naturally
thought
of
turning
in
time
of
trouble
aunt
harriet
advice
might
not
always
be
palatable
but
it
was
combined
with
such
practical
help
that
there
seemed
no
alternative
but
to
follow
it
miss
beach
though
not
a
rich
woman
was
possessed
of
very
comfortable
private
means
she
lived
in
an
house
just
opposite
the
abbey
and
her
windows
looked
out
on
a
view
of
towers
and
cloisters
and
tall
lime
trees
with
a
foreground
of
monuments
to
some
people
the
array
of
tombstones
would
have
proved
a
dismal
prospect
but
she
declared
it
never
distressed
her
in
the
least
she
prided
herself
greatly
on
the
fact
that
she
had
been
born
in
the
house
where
her
father
grandfather
and
had
also
come
into
the
world
and
spent
their
lives
except
for
an
occasional
expedition
to
highfield
she
rarely
left
home
all
her
interests
were
in
seaton
and
she
became
miserable
directly
if
she
were
away
from
her
native
city
the
little
woodwards
had
never
regarded
it
as
much
of
a
treat
to
go
and
stay
at
abbey
close
the
restraint
which
the
visit
necessitated
quite
neutralized
the
afternoon
at
the
cinema
with
which
their
aunt
invariably
entertained
them
the
fine
old
chippendale
furniture
had
to
be
treated
with
a
respect
not
meted
out
to
the
chairs
and
tables
at
home
boots
must
be
scrupulously
wiped
on
the
bedrooms
left
tidy
and
books
and
ornaments
were
to
be
held
altogether
sacred
from
the
ravages
of
prying
young
fingers
winona
had
taken
up
her
residence
there
with
somewhat
the
feeling
of
a
novice
entering
a
nunnery
she
was
not
quite
sure
how
she
and
aunt
harriet
were
going
to
get
on
to
her
great
relief
however
things
turned
out
better
than
she
expected
miss
beach
received
her
with
unusual
complacency
and
the
two
settled
down
quite
harmoniously
together
the
fact
was
that
winona
a
visitor
with
nothing
to
do
and
winona
a
busy
high
school
girl
were
utterly
different
persons
it
is
one
thing
to
wander
round
somebody
else
house
and
feel
bored
and
quite
another
to
hang
up
your
hat
realize
you
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
establishment
and
occupy
yourself
with
your
own
business
once
she
had
fallen
into
the
swing
of
work
at
school
winona
began
to
appreciate
the
orderliness
of
her
aunt
arrangements
it
had
never
seemed
to
matter
at
home
if
the
breakfast
were
late
and
she
arrived
at
miss
harmon
when
the
clock
had
struck
nine
but
at
the
high
it
was
an
affair
of
vital
importance
to
be
in
her
seat
before
and
she
daily
blessed
the
punctuality
of
aunt
harriet
cook
it
was
also
a
great
boon
to
be
able
to
prepare
her
lessons
in
quiet
her
family
had
never
realized
the
necessity
of
silence
during
study
hours
and
she
had
been
used
to
learn
french
vocabularies
or
translate
her
latin
exercises
to
a
distracting
accompaniment
of
ernie
trumpet
dorrie
and
quarrels
godfrey
mouth
organ
and
letty
strumming
upon
the
piano
it
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
to
do
my
prep
at
home
she
thought
sometimes
i
no
idea
what
work
was
like
before
i
came
to
seaton
it
would
do
those
youngsters
good
to
have
a
drilling
i
wish
they
could
have
been
in
the
preparatory
no
i
do
because
then
i
should
have
had
them
here
and
it
would
have
been
to
all
peace
on
the
whole
things
are
much
better
as
they
are
miss
beach
was
so
extremely
busy
with
her
own
multifarious
occupations
that
she
had
not
time
to
see
very
much
of
her
she
made
every
arrangement
for
her
comfort
however
and
caused
the
piano
to
be
moved
into
the
for
the
convenience
of
her
practicing
she
had
always
had
a
tender
spot
for
winona
whom
she
regarded
as
the
one
hopeful
character
in
a
family
of
noodles
she
talked
to
her
at
meal
times
about
a
variety
of
subjects
some
of
them
within
her
intelligence
but
others
completely
so
far
above
her
head
she
even
tried
to
draw
her
out
upon
school
matters
this
however
was
a
dead
failure
winona
most
unfortunately
could
not
overcome
her
awe
for
her
aunt
and
refused
to
expand
to
all
the
questions
about
her
form
her
companions
teachers
lessons
or
new
experiences
she
replied
in
monosyllables
it
was
a
sad
pity
for
miss
beach
had
really
hoped
to
win
the
confidence
and
prove
a
temporary
mother
to
her
but
finding
her
advances
repulsed
she
also
shrank
back
into
her
shell
and
the
intimacy
which
might
have
existed
between
them
was
postponed
to
future
years
young
folks
often
fail
to
realize
what
an
interest
their
doings
may
have
to
people
and
how
their
bright
fresh
outlook
on
life
may
come
as
a
tonic
to
older
and
wearier
minds
it
never
struck
winona
to
try
to
amuse
or
entertain
her
aunt
at
her
present
crude
stage
of
development
she
was
incapable
of
appreciating
the
subtle
pathos
that
clings
round
elderly
lives
and
their
wistful
longing
to
be
included
in
the
experiences
of
the
rising
generation
shyness
and
lack
of
perception
held
her
silent
and
the
empty
corner
in
aunt
harriet
heart
went
unfilled
saturday
and
sunday
were
the
only
days
upon
which
winona
had
time
to
feel
homesick
her
mother
had
at
first
suggested
her
returning
to
highfield
for
the
week
ends
but
miss
beach
had
strongly
vetoed
the
project
on
the
justifiable
ground
that
even
the
earliest
train
from
ashbourne
on
monday
mornings
did
not
reach
seaton
till
so
that
winona
would
lose
the
first
hour
lesson
of
her
school
week
she
might
have
added
that
she
considered
such
frequent
home
visits
would
prove
highly
unsettling
and
interfere
greatly
with
her
work
but
for
once
she
refrained
from
stating
her
frank
opinion
probably
deeming
the
other
argument
sufficient
and
willing
to
spare
woodward
feelings
letters
from
highfield
showed
little
change
in
the
usual
conduct
of
family
affairs
the
children
were
still
attending
miss
harmon
school
though
they
were
to
leave
at
christmas
we
are
late
nearly
every
day
now
you
are
not
here
to
make
ernie
start
wrote
mamie
almost
as
if
it
were
an
achievement
to
be
proud
of
he
locked
the
piano
and
threw
the
key
in
the
garden
and
we
could
none
of
us
practice
for
three
days
was
it
lovely
letty
pours
out
tea
if
mother
is
in
and
yesterday
she
broke
the
teapot
the
chief
items
of
news
however
concerned
percy
that
young
gentleman
with
what
aunt
harriet
considered
his
usual
perversity
had
sprained
his
ankle
on
the
very
day
before
he
ought
to
have
returned
to
school
he
had
been
ordered
to
lie
up
on
the
sofa
but
winona
gathered
that
the
doctor
directions
had
not
been
very
strictly
carried
out
she
strongly
suspected
that
the
patient
did
not
wish
to
recover
too
quickly
whether
or
not
that
had
been
the
case
percy
was
now
convalescent
and
was
to
set
off
for
school
on
the
following
friday
longworth
college
was
not
a
great
distance
and
as
percy
would
have
to
pass
through
seaton
on
his
way
aunt
harriet
invited
him
to
break
his
journey
there
and
spend
the
night
at
her
house
she
had
a
poor
opinion
of
the
boy
capacity
but
having
undertaken
a
half
share
in
his
education
she
felt
an
increased
sense
of
responsibility
towards
him
and
wished
to
find
an
opportunity
of
a
word
with
him
in
private
winona
hailed
her
brother
advent
with
immense
joy
even
so
flying
a
visit
was
better
than
nothing
letters
were
an
inadequate
means
of
expression
and
she
was
longing
to
pour
out
all
her
new
experiences
she
wanted
to
tell
percy
about
the
symposium
and
her
friendship
for
garnet
and
the
chemistry
class
and
the
gymnasium
practice
and
to
show
him
her
hockey
jersey
which
had
just
arrived
she
had
so
long
been
the
recipient
of
all
his
school
news
that
it
would
be
delightful
to
turn
the
tables
and
give
him
a
chronicle
of
her
own
doings
at
the
seaton
high
which
in
her
opinion
quite
rivaled
longworth
college
to
the
young
people
scarcely
suppressed
satisfaction
miss
beach
went
out
after
tea
to
attend
an
important
meeting
leaving
her
nephew
and
niece
to
spend
the
evening
alone
together
they
had
never
expected
such
luck
as
it
was
friday
winona
had
no
lessons
to
prepare
for
the
next
day
and
could
feel
free
for
a
delightful
chat
she
flung
herself
into
aunt
harriet
special
big
easy
chair
by
the
fireside
and
lounged
luxuriously
while
percy
prowled
about
the
room
well
i
glad
you
jogging
along
all
right
he
remarked
when
his
sister
long
account
came
to
a
pause
though
please
do
for
a
moment
compare
your
blessed
old
high
school
to
longworth
for
they
not
in
the
same
running
aunt
harriet
has
quite
eaten
you
up
yet
i
see
she
not
such
a
gorgon
as
i
expected
in
fact
she
been
rather
decent
the
dragon
sheathed
her
talons
well
that
good
biz
you
went
off
as
tragic
as
iphigenia
heroically
declaring
yourself
the
family
sacrifice
did
i
winona
had
almost
forgotten
her
original
attitude
of
martyr
three
weeks
had
made
a
vast
difference
to
her
feelings
if
you
can
peg
it
out
in
comfort
with
the
dragon
so
much
to
the
good
should
care
to
live
here
myself
though
it
a
dull
hole
number
abbey
close
would
be
my
choice
of
a
residence
well
it
not
likely
you
ever
have
the
chance
of
living
here
retorted
winona
taking
up
the
cudgels
for
her
adopted
home
i
do
know
about
that
returned
percy
the
house
belongs
to
aunt
harriet
she
have
to
leave
her
property
to
somebody
i
suppose
when
she
shuffles
off
this
mortal
coil
i
the
eldest
son
and
my
percy
beach
woodward
that
ought
to
count
for
something
aunt
harriet
not
going
to
die
yet
said
winona
gravely
i
think
it
horrid
of
you
to
talk
like
this
oh
i
do
wish
the
old
girl
any
harm
but
one
may
have
an
eye
to
the
future
all
the
same
was
the
airy
response
remember
jack
cassidy
who
was
a
pupil
at
the
vicarage
his
aunt
left
him
five
thousand
pounds
yes
and
i
heard
he
muddling
it
away
as
fast
as
he
can
mary
james
told
me
her
father
guardian
of
part
of
his
property
until
you
know
he
a
topper
is
jack
he
promised
to
take
me
for
a
day
sometime
to
hartleburn
when
the
races
are
on
now
do
you
go
blabbing
or
never
tell
you
anything
again
joynson
said
oh
for
goodness
sake
shut
up
a
boy
of
sixteen
is
going
to
be
by
an
old
fogey
like
joynson
he
has
the
mater
far
too
much
under
his
finger
and
thumb
for
my
taste
if
you
want
to
be
chums
with
me
do
preach
winona
was
silent
her
brother
infatuation
for
the
vicar
scapegrace
ward
was
the
affair
of
a
year
ago
she
had
hoped
he
had
forgotten
it
his
escapades
at
the
time
in
company
with
his
hero
had
caused
his
mother
to
seek
the
advice
and
guidance
of
her
trustee
some
one
was
telling
me
the
other
day
that
old
oak
furniture
is
worth
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
now
continued
percy
his
eye
roving
round
the
room
with
an
air
almost
of
future
proprietorship
if
that
so
these
things
of
aunt
harriet
are
a
little
gold
mine
there
was
an
account
of
a
sale
in
the
newspaper
with
a
picture
of
a
cupboard
that
fetched
two
hundred
pounds
it
was
first
cousin
to
that
nodding
at
a
splendidly
carved
old
piece
which
faced
him
miss
beach
household
goods
were
inherited
from
her
and
included
some
fine
specimens
of
oak
as
well
as
rare
chippendale
winona
was
too
young
to
be
a
connoisseur
of
antiquities
but
she
had
the
curiosity
to
rise
from
her
chair
and
join
percy
in
his
inspection
of
the
article
in
question
i
tell
you
they
as
alike
as
two
peas
he
declared
same
shape
same
sort
of
carving
same
knobs
at
the
end
the
reason
why
i
remember
the
thing
is
that
the
buyer
found
a
secret
drawer
in
it
after
he
got
it
home
with
some
old
rubbish
inside
and
there
was
a
lawsuit
as
to
who
owned
these
he
claimed
he
bought
the
lot
with
the
cupboard
but
the
judge
made
him
turn
them
up
to
the
family
of
the
original
owner
that
was
why
there
was
a
picture
of
the
cupboard
in
the
newspaper
it
put
an
arrow
showing
the
place
of
the
secret
drawer
i
wonder
if
there
one
here
too
i
going
to
have
a
try
by
jove
there
is
a
vigorous
pull
had
dislodged
a
drawer
in
a
very
unexpected
situation
winona
would
certainly
never
have
thought
of
its
existence
nor
would
percy
if
the
newspaper
had
not
given
away
the
secret
he
looked
eagerly
inside
no
treasures
hidden
in
here
absolutely
nothing
at
all
except
this
piece
of
paper
perhaps
aunt
harriet
has
never
found
it
out
ventured
winona
percy
did
not
answer
immediately
he
was
reading
the
writing
on
the
paper
you
bet
she
has
he
cried
at
last
flushing
angrily
i
never
thought
she
much
opinion
of
me
but
i
call
this
the
limit
it
going
where
it
deserves
and
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
he
flung
the
cause
of
offense
into
the
fire
for
a
moment
winona
did
not
realize
what
he
had
done
by
the
time
she
reached
the
hearth
the
paper
was
already
half
consumed
she
made
a
snatch
at
it
with
the
tongs
but
a
flame
sprang
up
and
forestalled
her
she
had
just
time
to
read
the
words
last
will
and
testament
of
me
har
before
the
whole
sank
into
ashes
she
turned
to
her
brother
with
a
white
scared
face
percy
you
never
burnt
aunt
harriet
will
ashamed
already
of
his
impetuous
act
the
boy
nevertheless
tried
to
bluff
the
matter
off
it
was
an
abominable
shame
when
i
named
beach
after
her
too
i
would
have
believed
it
if
i
had
read
it
myself
he
blustered
read
what
i
sha
tell
you
look
here
win
you
must
promise
on
your
honor
that
you
never
breathe
a
word
about
this
perhaps
aunt
harriet
ought
to
know
she
must
know
i
tell
you
i
say
win
i
not
at
all
sure
that
what
i
just
done
is
a
chargeable
offense
i
believe
they
call
it
a
felony
you
would
like
to
see
me
put
into
prison
would
you
then
hold
your
tongue
about
it
give
me
your
word
can
you
keep
a
secret
i
promise
gasped
winona
percy
was
squeezing
her
little
finger
nail
in
orthodox
fashion
and
the
agony
was
acute
i
promise
faithfully
she
was
in
a
terrible
quandary
her
natural
straightforwardness
urged
her
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
had
she
been
the
actual
transgressor
she
would
certainly
have
done
so
and
faced
the
consequences
but
this
was
percy
secret
not
her
own
he
was
no
favorite
with
his
aunt
and
so
outrageous
an
act
would
prejudice
him
fatally
in
her
eyes
the
hint
about
prison
frightened
winona
she
knew
nothing
of
law
but
she
thought
it
highly
probable
that
burning
a
will
was
a
punishable
crime
suppose
aunt
harriet
rigid
conscience
obliged
her
to
communicate
with
the
police
and
deliver
percy
into
the
hands
of
justice
such
a
horrible
possibility
must
be
avoided
at
all
costs
the
sound
of
a
in
the
door
made
her
start
in
a
panic
she
rushed
to
the
old
cupboard
and
pushed
back
the
secret
drawer
into
its
place
when
miss
beach
entered
the
her
nephew
and
niece
were
sitting
reading
by
the
fireside
their
choice
of
literature
might
perhaps
have
astonished
her
for
percy
was
poring
over
sir
oliver
lodge
man
and
the
universe
while
winona
nose
was
buried
in
herbert
spencer
sociology
but
if
indeed
she
noticed
it
she
perhaps
set
it
down
to
a
laudable
desire
to
improve
their
minds
and
placed
the
matter
to
their
credit
percy
took
his
departure
next
morning
and
winona
saw
him
off
at
the
railway
station
remember
you
to
keep
that
business
dark
he
reminded
her
aunt
harriet
must
never
find
out
she
been
jawing
me
no
end
about
responsibility
and
looking
after
the
kids
and
supporting
the
mater
and
all
that
rubbed
it
in
hard
i
can
tell
you
great
juggins
do
i
look
like
the
mainstay
of
a
family
as
winona
watched
his
boyish
face
laughing
at
her
from
the
window
of
the
moving
train
she
decided
that
he
certainly
did
not
she
sighed
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
station
life
seemed
suddenly
to
have
assumed
new
perplexities
percy
act
weighed
heavily
on
her
mind
it
seemed
such
a
base
return
for
all
aunt
harriet
was
doing
on
their
behalf
she
longed
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
and
say
how
much
she
appreciated
going
to
the
high
school
but
she
could
not
find
the
words
theknowledge
of
the
secret
raised
an
extra
barrier
between
herself
and
her
aunt
so
she
sat
at
lunch
time
even
shyer
and
more
speechless
than
usual
and
let
the
ball
of
conversation
persistently
drop
fretting
for
her
brother
i
suppose
thought
miss
beach
she
can
talk
fast
enough
with
friends
of
her
own
age
well
i
suppose
an
old
body
like
myself
must
expect
to
be
company
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
she
was
too
proud
to
let
the
hurt
feeling
show
itself
on
her
face
however
and
propping
up
the
newspaper
beside
her
plate
she
plunged
into
the
latest
accounts
from
the
front
chapter
vi
a
crisis
winona
had
been
more
than
a
month
nearly
five
weeks
indeed
at
the
seaton
high
school
in
the
first
few
days
of
her
introduction
to
she
had
told
herself
that
the
difficulty
of
the
work
consisted
largely
in
its
newness
and
that
as
soon
as
she
grew
accustomed
to
it
she
would
sail
along
as
swimmingly
as
garnet
emerson
or
olave
parry
or
hilda
langley
or
agatha
james
most
unfortunately
she
found
her
theory
acted
in
the
opposite
direction
closer
acquaintance
with
her
form
subjects
proved
their
extreme
toughness
she
was
not
nearly
up
to
the
standard
of
the
rest
of
the
girls
her
latin
grammar
was
shaky
her
french
only
a
trifle
better
she
had
merely
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
geometry
and
had
not
before
studied
chemistry
her
teacher
seemed
to
expect
her
to
understand
many
things
of
which
she
had
hitherto
never
heard
and
was
apparently
astounded
at
her
ignorance
winona
puzzled
over
her
during
many
hours
of
preparation
but
she
made
little
headway
the
royal
road
to
learning
which
she
had
fondly
hoped
to
tread
was
proving
itself
a
stony
and
twisting
path
seem
to
get
on
all
right
she
said
wistfully
to
garnet
one
day
why
yes
of
course
one
has
to
work
admitted
her
friend
miss
huntley
keeps
one
up
to
the
mark
but
one
must
expect
that
in
they
do
put
scholarship
holders
in
the
preparatory
i
was
all
at
sea
in
math
this
morning
you
were
rather
a
duffer
certainly
the
problems
were
as
difficult
as
the
ones
they
gave
us
in
the
entrance
exam
if
those
did
floor
you
why
could
you
work
these
but
they
did
floor
me
i
barely
managed
half
the
paper
i
reckoned
failed
in
it
garnet
looked
surprised
then
your
other
subjects
must
have
been
extremely
good
to
make
up
for
it
i
was
told
that
we
should
probably
stand
or
fall
by
maths
you
were
ripping
in
everything
else
i
suppose
scored
no
end
winona
did
not
answer
the
question
she
was
conscious
that
none
of
her
papers
could
have
merited
such
an
eulogium
she
envied
garnet
grasp
of
the
form
work
try
as
she
would
her
own
exercises
and
translations
were
poor
affairs
and
her
memory
found
it
difficult
to
marshal
the
enormous
number
of
facts
that
were
daily
forced
upon
it
miss
huntley
at
first
was
patient
but
as
the
weeks
wore
on
and
winona
still
wallowed
in
a
quagmire
of
amazing
mistakes
she
grew
sarcastic
the
girl
winced
under
some
of
her
cutting
remarks
apparently
the
mistress
imagined
her
failure
to
be
due
to
laziness
and
inattention
and
sooner
than
confess
that
she
could
not
understand
the
work
winona
was
silent
she
never
mentioned
the
long
hours
she
spent
poring
over
her
books
in
aunt
harriet
after
all
it
was
better
to
be
thought
idle
than
stupid
but
it
was
humiliating
to
feel
that
she
was
counted
among
the
slackers
of
the
form
while
garnet
was
already
winning
laurels
the
contrast
between
the
two
scholarship
holders
could
not
fail
to
be
noticed
miss
huntley
privately
known
to
the
form
as
bunty
was
a
clever
but
rather
remorseless
teacher
she
had
been
on
the
staff
since
the
opening
of
the
school
two
years
before
and
she
was
determined
at
all
costs
to
maintain
the
high
standard
inaugurated
at
its
foundation
she
was
herself
the
product
of
high
school
education
and
knew
to
the
last
scruple
how
much
to
require
from
girls
in
to
those
who
appeared
to
be
really
trying
their
best
she
was
ready
to
give
intelligent
help
but
she
had
no
mercy
for
slackers
she
was
possessed
of
a
certain
amount
of
dry
humor
greatly
appreciated
by
the
form
though
each
quaked
privately
lest
through
some
unlucky
slip
she
might
find
herself
the
object
of
the
smart
but
withering
satires
despite
her
strictness
bunty
was
popular
she
was
an
admirable
tennis
player
and
a
formidable
champion
in
a
match
mistresses
girls
her
strong
personality
fascinated
winona
who
would
have
done
much
to
gain
her
approval
so
far
however
she
was
entirely
on
miss
black
list
matters
came
to
a
crisis
over
a
difficult
bit
of
vergil
latin
was
next
to
mathematics
the
most
painfully
wobbling
of
winona
shaky
subjects
she
had
puzzled
in
vain
over
this
particular
piece
of
translation
the
words
indeed
she
had
found
in
the
dictionary
but
she
could
not
twist
them
into
sense
old
vergil
utterly
stumped
me
she
mourned
to
garnet
as
they
met
in
the
before
nine
if
bunty
puts
me
to
construe
anywhere
on
page
i
a
gone
coon
i
feeling
in
a
blue
funk
i
can
tell
you
poor
old
bluebottle
do
wrinkle
up
your
forehead
like
that
making
permanent
lines
it
a
bad
trick
and
just
spoils
you
i
ca
help
it
when
i
worried
then
do
worry
oh
it
easy
enough
for
you
you
do
have
to
receive
the
vials
of
bunty
scorn
winona
hoped
against
hope
that
the
difficult
page
might
fall
to
somebody
else
turn
miss
huntley
took
no
particular
order
but
selected
girls
at
random
to
construe
the
lesson
in
a
form
of
twenty
it
was
possible
not
to
be
chosen
at
all
winona
kept
very
quiet
so
as
not
to
attract
the
mistress
attention
marjorie
kemp
and
olave
parry
had
already
translated
half
of
the
fatal
page
with
tolerable
credit
miss
eye
was
wandering
in
the
direction
of
irene
mills
winona
dared
to
breathe
then
alas
alas
some
unlucky
star
caused
the
mistress
to
look
back
towards
the
middle
of
the
room
in
a
spasm
of
nervousness
winona
jerked
her
elbow
and
away
went
her
clattering
on
to
the
floor
and
dispersing
its
collection
of
pens
pencils
nibs
and
other
treasures
beneath
the
neighboring
desks
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
the
culprit
was
instantly
the
center
of
attention
a
clumsy
thing
to
do
leave
those
things
where
they
are
you
can
pick
them
up
after
the
lesson
observed
miss
huntley
grimly
go
on
now
with
the
translation
winona
hot
face
had
been
hidden
under
audrey
redfern
desk
she
rose
reluctantly
her
confusion
made
the
hard
passage
seem
twice
as
difficult
even
the
words
which
she
had
carefully
looked
up
in
the
dictionary
and
learned
by
heart
escaped
her
fickle
memory
she
stumbled
and
floundered
hopelessly
getting
redder
and
redder
with
shame
miss
huntley
preserved
an
ominous
silence
and
did
not
attempt
to
help
her
out
that
will
do
she
said
at
the
end
of
about
eight
lines
after
such
a
complete
exhibition
of
incompetence
we
wo
inflict
any
more
of
your
bungling
upon
the
form
we
must
see
if
we
can
find
a
way
of
sharpening
your
wits
your
brain
seems
to
have
been
lying
fallow
since
you
came
to
school
you
will
report
yourself
to
miss
bishop
at
four
this
afternoon
the
rest
of
the
morning
passed
like
a
bad
dream
to
winona
it
was
a
rare
event
for
a
teacher
to
send
a
girl
to
the
head
mistress
the
prospect
of
the
coming
interview
made
her
cold
with
apprehension
she
avoided
garnet
at
one
and
hurried
out
of
the
without
speaking
to
any
one
she
had
a
wild
project
of
pleading
a
headache
and
begging
aunt
harriet
to
let
her
stop
at
home
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
then
explanations
would
be
infinitely
worse
no
it
was
better
to
face
the
horrible
ordeal
and
get
it
over
as
it
happened
miss
beach
had
gone
out
to
lunch
so
that
leave
of
absence
was
an
impossibility
winona
ate
her
early
dinner
alone
are
you
well
miss
would
you
like
me
to
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
asked
alice
the
housemaid
noticing
that
the
pudding
was
unappreciated
and
divining
that
something
must
be
amiss
no
thanks
i
in
a
hurry
and
must
fly
off
to
school
as
quickly
as
i
can
it
my
early
afternoon
winona
had
a
music
lesson
at
a
quarter
past
two
on
thursdays
it
was
always
rather
a
rush
to
get
back
in
time
for
it
she
crammed
her
preludes
and
schubert
impromptus
automatically
into
her
portfolio
and
started
it
was
only
when
she
was
down
church
street
that
she
remembered
she
had
left
her
book
of
studies
on
the
top
of
the
piano
needless
to
say
her
lesson
that
day
was
hardly
a
success
in
the
disturbed
state
of
her
mind
she
was
quite
incapable
of
concentrating
her
attention
on
music
miss
catteral
looked
surprised
at
her
wrong
notes
and
imperfect
phrasing
i
shall
expect
to
find
some
improvement
in
this
next
week
she
remarked
have
you
practiced
your
hour
daily
you
must
take
these
bars
which
i
have
marked
separately
and
play
each
twenty
times
in
succession
slowly
at
first
and
then
faster
and
remember
here
that
it
is
the
left
hand
which
gives
the
melody
and
the
right
is
only
the
accompaniment
i
thought
you
had
sufficient
music
in
you
to
appreciate
that
the
way
you
thumped
out
those
chords
was
painful
i
am
not
pleased
at
all
miss
catteral
so
rarely
scolded
that
winona
felt
doubly
humiliated
it
was
all
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
general
of
the
day
she
fetched
her
and
went
to
the
art
class
here
at
least
she
would
have
peace
for
an
hour
though
every
one
of
the
sixty
minutes
was
bringing
her
nearer
to
her
dreaded
interview
at
four
with
a
horrible
sinking
feeling
in
her
heart
and
a
trembling
sensation
in
her
knees
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
study
and
entered
in
response
to
the
come
in
which
followed
miss
bishop
looked
up
from
some
papers
motioned
her
to
a
chair
and
went
on
writing
for
several
minutes
to
winona
it
seemed
worse
than
waiting
at
the
dentist
the
suspense
was
ghastly
at
last
the
principal
paused
laid
down
her
pen
and
blotted
her
pages
come
here
winona
woodward
she
said
quietly
i
wish
to
have
a
straight
talk
with
you
miss
bishop
eyes
were
her
most
striking
feature
they
were
large
and
clear
but
the
pupils
were
unusually
small
appearing
mere
black
specks
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
circle
of
blue
this
peculiarity
gave
her
a
particularly
intense
and
penetrating
expression
winona
standing
at
attention
beside
the
desk
dropped
her
own
eyes
before
the
steady
searching
gaze
miss
huntley
report
of
your
work
is
not
at
all
satisfactory
began
miss
bishop
i
have
been
watching
your
progress
since
you
joined
the
school
and
i
can
not
think
you
are
trying
your
best
at
first
when
you
were
totally
new
to
your
form
i
suspended
judgment
but
you
have
been
here
nearly
half
a
term
now
quite
long
enough
to
accustom
yourself
to
our
methods
i
confess
i
am
greatly
disappointed
i
had
hoped
for
better
things
from
the
holder
of
a
county
scholarship
winona
remained
silent
she
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
in
it
must
be
sheer
lack
of
grit
and
effort
continued
miss
bishop
i
can
not
understand
how
a
girl
who
did
so
remarkably
well
in
the
entrance
examination
can
rest
content
with
such
a
low
record
how
long
do
you
take
over
your
preparation
until
my
aunt
sends
me
to
bed
replied
winona
in
a
very
subdued
voice
i
spend
the
whole
evening
at
my
lessons
miss
bishop
looked
puzzled
then
the
work
must
be
too
difficult
for
you
if
that
is
the
case
i
must
remove
you
to
was
notorious
in
the
school
as
a
refuge
for
incompetence
it
was
mainly
composed
of
girls
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
who
could
not
reach
the
standard
of
the
sixth
and
who
went
by
the
nickname
of
owls
or
stupids
the
prospect
of
being
relegated
to
such
an
intellectual
backwater
spread
palpable
dismay
over
winona
face
miss
bishop
smiled
rather
grimly
we
ca
win
honors
without
paying
the
price
you
must
know
that
already
by
experience
i
conclude
that
you
studied
hard
for
the
scholarship
examination
well
your
form
work
requires
equally
close
application
here
is
miss
huntley
report
weak
latin
beneath
criticism
mathematics
extremely
bad
yet
in
all
these
three
subjects
you
gained
a
high
percentage
in
the
entrance
examination
i
have
your
papers
here
yes
latin
french
mathematics
rapidly
turning
over
the
pages
it
is
simply
incredible
how
you
have
fallen
off
winona
was
gazing
at
the
sheets
of
foolscap
in
the
principal
hand
those
are
my
papers
she
faltered
certainly
they
are
they
marked
with
your
number
but
i
was
number
i
was
number
miss
bishop
stooped
opened
a
drawer
in
her
bureau
and
took
out
a
book
here
it
is
in
black
and
white
she
replied
no
winona
woodward
winona
shaking
hands
clutched
the
edge
of
the
bureau
in
a
flash
the
whole
horrible
truth
was
suddenly
revealed
to
her
until
that
moment
she
had
almost
forgotten
how
she
and
the
girl
had
collided
at
the
door
of
the
and
dropped
their
cards
in
picking
them
up
they
must
have
effected
an
exchange
she
remembered
that
she
had
been
too
agitated
to
notice
her
number
until
after
the
accident
had
happened
she
now
related
the
circumstance
as
best
she
could
miss
bishop
listened
aghast
what
number
did
you
say
you
took
in
the
ten
that
is
entered
in
my
book
as
marjorie
kaye
i
have
the
rest
of
the
papers
in
this
bundle
let
me
see
yes
here
is
no
is
this
your
handwriting
then
i
afraid
there
has
been
a
terrible
blunder
and
the
scholarship
has
been
awarded
to
the
wrong
girl
the
principal
consternation
was
equalled
by
winona
to
the
latter
the
ground
seemed
slipping
from
under
her
feet
she
tried
to
speak
but
failed
a
great
lump
rose
in
her
throat
for
a
moment
the
room
whirled
round
this
set
of
papers
no
was
marked
so
low
as
to
be
out
of
the
running
continued
miss
bishop
it
is
a
most
unfortunate
mistake
and
places
the
school
in
an
extremely
awkward
position
i
must
consult
with
the
governors
at
once
pending
their
decision
it
will
be
better
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
anybody
you
may
go
now
winona
managed
somehow
to
get
herself
out
of
the
study
to
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
and
to
walk
home
to
abbey
close
her
aunt
was
still
absent
for
which
she
was
intensely
thankful
and
ignoring
the
tea
that
was
waiting
on
the
table
she
rushed
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
her
one
imperative
need
was
to
be
alone
she
must
face
the
situation
squarely
her
world
had
suddenly
turned
instead
of
being
the
winner
of
the
county
scholarship
she
was
among
the
rejected
candidates
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
had
always
marveled
how
her
indifferent
papers
could
have
scored
such
a
success
she
wondered
this
explanation
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
all
this
time
she
had
been
wearing
another
girl
laurels
what
was
going
to
happen
next
she
supposed
the
scholarship
would
be
taken
from
her
and
given
to
its
rightful
owner
and
herself
she
would
probably
be
packed
home
as
percy
had
prophesied
like
a
whipped
puppy
possibly
aunt
harriet
might
offer
to
pay
her
fee
as
an
ordinary
pupil
at
the
high
school
but
in
either
case
the
humiliation
would
be
supreme
winona
dreaded
returning
home
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
the
work
the
high
school
had
opened
a
fresh
world
to
her
she
could
never
again
be
content
with
the
old
rut
miss
harmon
dull
lessons
would
be
intolerable
and
life
without
garnet
friendship
would
seem
a
blank
the
companionship
of
her
three
little
sisters
was
totally
inadequate
for
a
girl
who
was
fast
growing
up
she
shrank
from
speculating
how
her
mother
would
receive
the
bad
news
woodward
was
one
of
those
parents
who
expect
their
children
to
gain
the
prizes
which
they
were
incapable
of
winning
for
themselves
she
had
claimed
a
kind
of
credit
in
her
daughter
triumph
winona
knew
from
past
experience
that
so
keen
a
disappointment
would
involve
a
string
of
reproaches
regrets
and
fretting
she
would
probably
never
hear
the
last
of
it
the
family
hopes
had
been
pinned
upon
her
success
and
to
frustrate
them
was
to
court
utter
disgrace
for
the
present
she
must
live
with
this
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
her
head
but
she
hoped
the
governors
would
decide
the
matter
speedily
and
put
her
out
of
her
misery
there
is
one
virtue
in
a
supreme
trouble
it
dwarfs
all
minor
griefs
percy
secret
which
had
been
felt
as
a
continual
burden
seemed
to
sink
into
comparative
obscurity
and
the
worry
of
school
work
and
the
dread
of
miss
huntley
sarcasm
were
mere
flies
in
the
ointment
winona
never
quite
knew
how
she
got
through
the
week
that
followed
it
stayed
afterwards
in
her
memory
as
a
period
of
black
darkness
a
valley
of
humiliation
in
which
her
old
childish
self
slipped
away
and
a
new
stronger
and
more
capable
personality
was
born
to
face
the
future
she
had
resigned
herself
so
utterly
to
the
inevitable
that
when
at
last
miss
bishop
summons
came
she
was
able
to
walk
quite
calmly
into
the
study
the
principal
was
seated
as
usual
at
her
bureau
entrance
examination
papers
lay
before
her
her
manner
was
her
blue
eyes
looked
even
more
penetrating
than
usual
you
will
have
been
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
about
the
matter
of
the
scholarship
she
began
yes
miss
bishop
answered
winona
meekly
she
did
not
add
that
she
had
spent
eight
days
in
a
mental
purgatory
i
of
course
placed
the
facts
before
the
governors
and
we
at
once
communicated
with
the
parents
of
marjorie
kaye
we
find
however
that
in
the
meantime
she
has
been
elected
a
scholar
of
the
maria
harvey
foundation
and
will
therefore
be
unable
to
accept
this
scholarship
her
papers
and
those
of
garnet
emerson
were
the
only
ones
of
outstanding
merit
in
the
remaining
eighteen
we
find
a
uniform
level
of
mediocrity
as
regards
your
set
of
papers
the
general
standard
is
low
with
one
exception
we
consider
that
your
essay
on
lady
jane
grey
shows
an
originality
and
a
capacity
for
thought
which
may
be
worthy
of
training
on
the
strength
of
this
and
this
alone
the
governors
have
decided
to
allow
you
to
retain
your
scholarship
in
so
doing
they
are
perfectly
within
their
rights
they
did
not
undertake
to
grant
free
tuition
to
the
candidate
who
scored
the
highest
number
of
marks
but
to
the
one
who
in
their
opinion
was
most
likely
to
benefit
by
the
school
course
it
was
a
matter
to
be
settled
entirely
at
their
discretion
i
have
carefully
your
papers
and
compared
them
with
your
form
record
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
backward
and
in
many
subjects
but
that
you
are
not
idle
or
stupid
i
shall
make
arrangements
for
you
to
have
special
coaching
in
mathematics
latin
and
chemistry
until
you
can
keep
up
with
the
rest
of
the
form
i
find
your
reports
for
history
and
english
literature
are
good
which
confirms
my
opinion
that
you
do
not
lack
ability
you
will
need
to
work
very
hard
especially
at
those
subjects
in
which
you
are
so
deficient
but
i
trust
you
will
soon
show
a
marked
improvement
and
thus
justify
the
decision
of
the
governors
are
you
prepared
to
try
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
do
my
very
best
stammered
winona
quite
overcome
by
this
unexpected
then
that
is
all
that
need
be
said
miss
lever
will
take
you
every
day
from
to
for
private
tuition
mark
that
on
your
and
go
to
her
this
afternoon
in
the
preparatory
room
you
may
tell
miss
garside
that
i
am
disengaged
now
and
at
liberty
to
speak
to
her
winona
left
the
study
with
very
different
feelings
from
those
with
which
she
had
entered
her
spirits
were
so
high
that
she
wanted
to
dance
along
the
corridor
she
could
hardly
believe
her
good
fortune
those
great
and
important
gentlemen
the
governors
had
actually
approved
of
her
essay
to
the
extent
of
allowing
it
to
stand
as
her
qualification
for
the
scholarship
she
blessed
lady
jane
grey
and
edgar
allan
poe
and
browning
and
andré
de
chénier
and
the
happy
chance
that
had
made
her
combine
them
all
she
was
glad
she
had
paid
that
visit
to
hampton
court
and
that
she
had
seen
lady
jane
grey
portrait
and
had
been
able
to
describe
both
life
was
going
to
be
a
very
exhilarating
business
now
her
position
in
the
school
was
once
more
secure
i
show
them
how
i
can
work
she
thought
they
sha
be
sorry
that
they
let
me
stay
after
all
oh
i
am
in
luck
yes
i
the
luckiest
girl
in
the
school
chapter
vii
an
autumn
foray
winona
felt
that
she
now
started
life
at
the
high
school
on
an
entirely
new
basis
miss
bishop
and
miss
huntley
understood
her
limitations
and
judged
her
accordingly
it
was
not
by
any
means
that
they
lowered
their
standard
but
that
they
appreciated
her
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
the
form
and
gave
her
credit
for
her
hard
work
and
hard
work
it
undoubtedly
was
she
would
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
revise
her
lessons
before
breakfast
and
would
sit
toiling
over
books
and
exercises
in
the
evenings
till
even
aunt
harriet
indefatigable
worker
herself
would
tell
her
to
stop
and
wax
moral
on
the
folly
of
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
the
coaching
from
miss
lever
was
of
inestimable
value
it
supplied
just
the
gaps
in
which
she
was
deficient
and
gave
her
an
adequate
grasp
of
her
three
toughest
subjects
slowly
she
began
to
make
headway
she
saw
light
in
mathematical
problems
that
had
before
been
meaningless
formulæ
chemistry
was
less
of
a
hopeless
tangle
and
vergil
lines
construed
into
understandable
sentences
instead
of
utter
nonsense
it
was
only
gradual
progress
however
she
had
much
ground
to
cover
before
she
caught
up
the
form
she
was
plodding
but
not
a
brilliant
scholar
like
garnet
the
fact
was
that
winona
was
only
clever
in
one
direction
in
the
realm
of
imagination
her
mind
ran
like
a
racehorse
but
harnessed
to
heavy
intellectual
burdens
it
proved
but
a
sorry
steed
it
was
fortunate
for
both
her
health
and
her
spirits
that
head
work
did
not
represent
the
only
side
of
school
activities
miss
bishop
was
wise
enough
to
lay
much
stress
on
physical
development
a
ten
minutes
drill
was
part
of
the
daily
routine
a
gymnasium
practice
was
held
twice
a
week
and
wednesday
afternoons
were
devoted
to
hockey
in
addition
to
this
the
girls
played
tennis
on
the
asphalt
courts
during
the
winter
and
spring
terms
whenever
the
weather
was
suitable
and
basket
ball
was
constantly
going
on
in
the
playground
athletics
was
decidedly
the
fashionable
cult
of
the
school
kirsty
paterson
as
games
captain
made
it
her
business
to
see
that
nobody
slacked
without
justifiable
cause
she
would
break
up
knots
of
chatting
idlers
and
cajole
them
forth
to
cultivate
muscle
as
she
expressed
it
while
her
keen
eye
was
quick
to
note
anybody
points
and
employ
them
for
the
general
benefit
kirsty
jolly
breezy
manner
and
strict
sense
of
justice
made
her
an
admirable
captain
she
was
highly
popular
with
juniors
as
well
as
seniors
for
she
took
the
trouble
to
organize
the
games
of
the
little
girls
as
carefully
as
those
of
their
elders
it
insane
policy
to
neglect
the
kids
was
her
creed
now
the
time
to
be
training
them
get
them
thoroughly
well
in
hand
and
make
them
understand
what
expected
from
them
and
in
four
or
five
years
time
they
be
crack
players
yes
i
know
it
looking
far
ahead
and
we
prefects
wo
be
here
to
see
the
result
but
the
school
will
reap
the
benefit
some
day
and
that
the
main
thing
to
aim
at
proud
of
my
cadets
and
in
the
future
when
they
winning
laurels
for
the
seaton
high
perhaps
they
remember
i
started
them
on
the
right
track
up
the
standard
all
round
is
going
to
be
the
motto
while
i
captain
to
winona
athletics
and
organized
games
came
as
a
revelation
she
had
a
slim
wiry
little
figure
and
was
a
good
runner
with
a
capacity
for
keeping
her
breath
and
had
also
a
considerable
power
of
spring
all
of
which
stood
her
in
good
stead
both
in
the
hockey
field
and
in
the
gymnasium
though
kirsty
said
little
she
could
feel
her
efforts
were
being
watched
and
approved
and
the
knowledge
gave
her
a
tingling
sense
of
satisfaction
it
was
delightful
to
feel
that
she
was
a
factor
in
this
big
school
and
that
she
was
doing
her
bit
however
insignificant
to
help
up
the
athletic
standard
in
physical
agility
winona
was
superior
to
garnet
she
could
beat
her
easily
at
tennis
and
there
was
already
a
wide
gap
between
their
gymnastic
achievements
it
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
it
just
balanced
their
friendship
and
put
them
on
a
footing
of
equality
which
would
have
been
otherwise
absent
garnet
so
manifestly
first
in
form
work
possessed
of
greater
confidence
and
in
school
life
and
older
in
experience
for
her
years
than
winona
might
have
monopolized
the
lead
too
entirely
had
she
not
been
obliged
to
yield
the
palm
of
outdoor
sports
to
her
friend
garnet
was
in
truth
just
a
trifle
inclined
to
boss
she
liked
winona
and
wanted
her
for
a
chum
but
she
loved
to
lay
down
the
law
and
to
constitute
herself
an
authority
upon
every
possible
subject
there
was
no
doubt
it
was
owing
to
her
initiative
that
the
two
were
gaining
a
position
for
themselves
in
the
school
as
garnet
had
foreseen
the
part
they
had
taken
in
the
symposium
won
them
favorable
recognition
to
be
singled
out
as
soloists
and
to
have
the
honor
of
playing
an
accompaniment
for
the
prefects
had
raised
them
above
the
common
herd
and
though
a
few
were
jealous
more
were
ready
to
extend
the
hand
of
good
fellowship
in
their
own
form
they
were
living
down
the
prejudice
which
had
at
first
existed
against
them
hilda
langley
and
estelle
harrison
were
not
very
friendly
and
influenced
olave
parry
and
mollie
hill
against
them
but
these
formed
a
minority
and
the
bulk
of
the
girls
seemed
to
have
decided
in
their
favor
with
the
enormous
demands
made
on
her
time
by
her
home
preparation
winona
did
not
venture
to
join
many
of
the
school
guilds
she
would
have
liked
immensely
to
put
her
name
down
for
election
to
the
dramatic
society
the
debating
club
and
the
literary
association
but
these
all
required
rather
strenuous
brain
work
from
their
members
and
in
the
circumstances
she
knew
it
would
be
folly
to
take
them
up
at
some
future
date
when
her
ordinary
subjects
proved
less
of
a
burden
she
promised
herself
the
pleasure
of
being
numbered
among
that
select
clique
known
as
the
intellectuals
but
for
the
present
her
motto
must
be
grim
grind
the
patriotic
knitting
guild
seemed
more
feasible
she
paid
her
subscription
received
her
skeins
of
khaki
wool
and
started
mittens
to
fill
up
odd
moments
she
found
the
knitting
a
soothing
occupation
it
could
be
taken
up
and
laid
down
so
easily
it
often
went
to
school
with
her
and
would
come
out
during
the
interval
or
while
she
was
waiting
for
a
class
the
photographic
union
was
beyond
her
for
as
yet
she
had
no
camera
but
she
thought
she
was
justified
in
joining
the
natural
history
league
this
society
did
not
for
the
present
demand
papers
from
its
members
but
contented
itself
with
encouraging
the
collection
of
objects
for
the
school
museum
its
main
activities
would
be
during
the
summer
term
though
a
weather
record
was
kept
throughout
the
year
and
any
nature
notes
that
were
worthy
of
being
written
down
were
duly
chronicled
in
the
field
book
linda
fletcher
and
annie
hardy
two
of
the
prefects
were
the
leading
spirits
in
the
league
linda
was
great
on
entomology
and
having
a
brother
who
was
interested
in
the
subject
had
been
out
sugaring
in
his
company
in
august
and
september
and
had
secured
some
fine
specimens
of
moths
she
had
boxes
full
of
chrysalides
which
she
fondly
hoped
would
emerge
in
the
spring
into
perfect
insects
and
she
had
made
quite
a
good
little
collection
of
beetles
annie
was
more
interested
in
botany
she
pressed
flowers
and
leaves
dried
fruits
and
seed
vessels
and
made
praiseworthy
efforts
at
preserving
funguses
in
bottles
though
these
latter
attempts
were
not
always
attended
with
the
success
they
deserved
as
they
were
apt
to
acquire
a
gamey
odor
to
which
her
mother
very
naturally
objected
and
she
would
be
obliged
disconsolately
to
turn
them
out
into
the
november
happened
to
be
a
particularly
fine
month
at
seaton
there
had
been
little
rain
and
no
high
winds
to
blow
the
leaves
away
though
the
trees
in
the
city
were
bare
those
in
the
country
round
about
remained
almost
in
their
october
glory
and
in
sheltered
woods
some
were
still
green
the
persistent
sunshine
encouraged
the
natural
history
league
to
plan
an
excursion
for
its
members
and
after
a
consultation
with
miss
lever
the
botany
mistress
linda
pinned
up
the
following
announcement
on

and

those
intending
to
join
kindly
give
their
names
to
the
secretary
on
wednesday
at
latest
fletcher
the
prospect
of
a
ramble
was
alluring
winona
was
a
country
lover
so
she
forthwith
secured
aunt
harriet
permission
for
the
outing
and
placed
her
name
upon
the
list
i
do
think
there
be
more
than
a
dozen
of
us
altogether
said
linda
but
really
a
small
party
more
manageable
than
a
big
one
and
i
undertake
we
enjoy
ourselves
miss
lever
can
get
permission
for
us
to
walk
through
the
private
part
of
the
woods
there
no
shooting
this
autumn
you
know
so
that
will
be
simply
glorious
and
she
says
we
ought
to
find
some
fossils
in
the
quarry
if
we
luck
i
hope
the
weather
will
keep
up
do
forget
to
take
a
vasculum
or
a
basket
and
a
hammer
for
fossils
and
be
sure
you
put
on
strong
boots
the
tea
will
probably
be
eightpence
a
head
miss
lever
is
writing
beforehand
to
the
farm
to
make
arrangements
garnet
also
was
to
join
the
excursion
and
she
promised
to
call
for
winona
so
that
they
might
walk
to
the
station
together
the
latter
had
an
early
lunch
and
was
ready
dressed
and
waiting
for
her
friend
by
twenty
minutes
past
twelve
garnet
tram
was
late
and
by
the
time
she
reached
abbey
close
the
clock
pointed
to
the
i
frightfully
sorry
you
must
think
me
a
juggins
but
it
was
my
fault
she
apologized
we
shall
have
to
sprint
but
we
just
do
it
the
girls
set
off
at
a
tremendous
pace
along
the
close
and
down
the
abbey
avenue
but
it
was
difficult
to
keep
the
same
speed
through
the
town
where
the
streets
were
thronged
with
country
people
who
had
come
in
for
the
saturday
market
they
got
along
as
best
they
could
walking
first
on
the
pavement
and
then
on
the
road
dodging
round
stout
females
bearing
baskets
avoiding
hooting
motors
and
finally
making
a
dash
down
a
back
street
that
led
to
the
railway
bridge
they
clattered
down
the
steps
to
the
booking
office
secured
their
tickets
and
rushed
on
to
the
platform
the
hands
of
the
big
clock
were
at
exactly
the
guard
was
about
to
wave
his
green
flag
they
were
too
late
to
look
for
their
party
they
simply
pelted
towards
the
nearest
carriage
a
porter
opened
the
door
and
they
scrambled
in
just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
oh
thank
goodness
thank
goodness
gasped
garnet
i
thought
miss
it
i
never
had
such
a
run
in
my
life
before
oh
it
given
me
a
stitch
in
my
side
they
put
us
in
a
first
exulted
winona
breathlessly
we
have
it
all
to
ourselves
what
luck
hope
they
wo
make
a
fuss
about
our
tickets
when
we
get
out
it
was
the
porter
fault
he
opened
the
door
we
ask
miss
lever
to
explain
i
suppose
the
others
are
further
along
somewhere
in
the
train
i
wonder
if
they
saw
us
get
in
if
they
did
it
will
be
a
surprise
packet
for
them
when
we
turn
up
yes
they
have
made
up
their
minds
we
left
behind
the
two
girls
leaned
back
enjoying
the
luxury
of
traveling
in
a
compartment
they
felt
the
excursion
had
begun
well
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
their
satisfaction
was
however
when
they
neared
barnhill
the
train
instead
of
stopping
rushed
through
the
station
at
miles
an
hour
garnet
turned
to
winona
in
utter
consternation
oh
she
ejaculated
i
verily
believe
we
gone
and
got
into
the
express
they
saw
at
once
how
it
had
happened
the
fast
train
to
rockfield
must
have
been
five
minutes
late
in
their
hurry
they
had
mistaken
it
for
the
stopping
train
which
probably
had
been
drawn
up
behind
it
in
the
station
well
this
is
a
pretty
go
agreed
winona
we
shall
be
carried
on
to
rockfield
and
have
to
come
back
we
shall
miss
the
ramble
oh
it
the
limit
of
hard
luck
to
see
ourselves
whizzing
through
powerscroft
i
say
i
believe
we
stopping
after
all
they
let
down
the
window
and
looked
out
they
were
still
about
a
mile
from
powerscroft
but
the
train
drew
up
probably
in
obedience
to
an
adverse
signal
then
the
girls
did
a
terrible
and
awful
thing
they
never
remembered
afterwards
which
suggested
it
probably
the
idea
occurred
to
both
simultaneously
but
in
defiance
of
the
law
of
the
realm
and
the
rules
of
the
railway
company
they
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
climbed
down
on
to
the
line
there
were
some
railings
near
and
they
scrambled
over
these
and
dodged
down
an
embankment
into
a
coppice
before
anybody
in
the
train
had
time
to
give
an
alarm
they
hoped
their
flight
had
not
been
noticed
but
of
that
they
could
not
be
sure
they
hid
behind
some
bushes
until
they
heard
the
train
rumble
away
that
was
the
smartest
thing
we
ever
done
in
our
lives
chuckled
garnet
i
believe
we
could
be
fined
about
ten
pounds
each
if
they
caught
us
let
us
hurry
on
and
try
to
find
the
road
said
winona
who
was
rather
frightened
at
her
own
temerity
and
had
a
nervous
apprehension
lest
a
guard
or
a
signalman
or
some
other
railway
official
might
even
now
be
in
pursuit
and
arrest
them
on
a
charge
of
breaking
the
law
after
crossing
a
field
they
struck
a
path
which
led
them
eventually
into
a
i
know
where
we
are
affirmed
garnet
i
bicycled
this
way
once
monkend
woods
are
in
that
direction
and
if
we
turn
to
the
left
and
through
this
village
we
shall
get
there
sooner
than
the
others
i
believe
and
be
waiting
for
them
when
they
arrive
their
train
have
reached
powerscroft
yet
we
better
step
out
all
the
same
urged
winona
fortunately
garnet
possessed
the
bump
of
locality
her
recollection
of
the
district
was
correct
and
after
a
brisk
walk
of
about
a
mile
they
found
themselves
in
the
high
road
close
to
the
wood
and
sat
down
on
a
wall
to
wait
their
fast
train
and
short
cut
had
given
them
an
advantage
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
before
they
spied
the
rest
of
the
party
strolling
leisurely
up
the
hill
with
baskets
and
vasculums
the
surprise
of
the
league
at
seeing
them
was
immense
and
naturally
there
were
many
inquiries
as
to
how
they
had
thus
stolen
a
march
upon
their
friends
oh
we
came
in
an
aëroplane
said
garnet
jauntily
it
just
dropped
us
in
the
field
over
there
very
pleasant
run
though
a
little
chilly
in
the
clouds
she
was
obliged
to
own
up
however
in
answer
to
miss

give
a
precise
account
of
their
adventure
and
cry
peccavi
of
course
dollikins
had
to
be
orthodox
and
preach
a
short
sermon
she
confided
afterwards
to
winona
but
i
sure
she
have
done
the
same
thing
herself
in
the
circumstances
i
could
see
admiration
in
her
eye
although
she
talked
about
running
risks
and
the
possibility
of
broken
necks
miss
lever
otherwise
dollikins
from
the
fact
that
her
christian
name
was
dorothy
held
high
favor
among
the
girls
she
was
brisk
and
jolly
decidedly
athletic
and
a
leader
of
outdoor
expeditions
she
had
called
at
the
gamekeeper
cottage
and
shown
the
letter
of
permission
from
the
owner
of
the
property
so
that
the
party
was
able
to
explore
the
wood
with
a
clear
conscience
despite
the
trespass
notice
nailed
on
to
the
gate
and
what
a
delightful
wood
it
was
to
enter
it
was
like
stepping
into
one
of
grimm
fairy
tales
an
avenue
of
splendid
pines
reared
their
dark
boughs
against
a
russet
background
of
beeches
everywhere
the
leaves
seemed
to
have
donned
their
brightest
and
gayest
tints
as
if
bidding
a
last
before
they
fell
from
the
trees
the
undergrowth
was
gorgeous
bramble

honeysuckle
briony
rowan
and
alder
vied
with
one
another
in
the
vividness
of
their
crimson
and
orange
while
the
bracken
was
a
sea
of
pale
gold
there
were
all
sorts
of
delightful
things
to
be
found
acorns
lay
so
plentifully
in
the
pathway
that
the
girls
could
not
help
scrunching
them
underfoot
a
few
were
already
sending
out
tiny
shoots
in
anticipation
of
spring
and
these
were
carefully
saved
to
take
home
and
grow
in
bottles
a
stream
ran
through
the
wood
its
banks
almost
completely
covered
with
vivid
green
mosses
in
sheets
so
thick
and
compact
that
a
slight
pull
would
raise
a
yard
at
a
time
some
resembled
tufted
tassels
some
the
most
delicate

was
rewarded
by
finding

clump
of

curious
little
fungus
with
its
seeds
packed
like

eggs
inside
some

a
bright
red
toadstool
or

of

from
the
bushes
and
flew
past
them
so
near
that
they
could
see
the
green
flash
of
its
wings
and
the
red
markings
on
its
head
while
a
whole
fluttering
flight
of
tits
were
flitting
like
a
troop
of
fairies
round
the
hole
of
a
beech
miss
lever
was
as
enthusiastic
as
the
girls
she
climbed
over
fallen
tree
trunks
grubbed
among
dead
leaves
jumped
the
brook
and
scaled
fences
with
delightful
energy
it
was
she
who
pointed
out
the
heron
sailing
overhead
and
noticed
the
wren
nest
hanging
under
the
branch
of
a
fir
a
little
battered
with
autumn
rain
and
too
high
alas
to
be
taken
but
a
most
interesting
item
to
go
down
in
the
the
girls
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
tear
themselves
away
from
the
glory
of
the
woods
and
would
have
spent
the
whole
time
there
but
miss
lever
had
other
plans
come
along
we
scared
the
pheasants
quite
enough
she
declared
my
mind
is
set
on
fossils
and
if
we
do
go
on
to
copplestones
at
once
we
shall
be
caught
in
the
dark
or
miss
our
tea
or
our
train
or
something
equally
disagreeable
the
quarry
was
only
half
a
mile
away
and
it
proved
as
interesting
as
the
wood
being
saturday
afternoon
the
men
were
not
working
so
they
had
the
place
to
themselves
and
wandered
about
examining
heaps
of
shale
and
tapping
stones
with
their
hammers
garnet
and
winona
knew
nothing
of
geology
so
they
listened
with
due
meekness
while
the
instructed
few
discoursed
learnedly
on
palæozoic
rocks
stratified
conglomerates
and
quartzites
they
rejoiced
with
miss
lever
however
when
she
secured
a
fairly
intact
belemnite
it
was
the
only
good
find
they
had
though
some
of
the
girls
got
broken
bits
of
fossil
shells
the
fact
is
one
needs
a
whole
day
to
hunt
about
in
this
quarry
and
my
watch
tells
me
we
ought
to
be
going
said
miss
lever
who
feels
inclined
for
tea
everybody
felt
very
much
disposed
so
the
procession
started
off
cheerfully
for
the
farm
close
by
and
the
were
soon
hard
at
work
consuming
platefuls
of
bread
and
butter
jars
of
jam
and
piles
of
plum
cake
sixteen
varieties
of
wild
flowers
seven
various
specimens
of
fungi
nine
different
sorts
of
berries
twelve
species
of
birds
noticed
also
rabbits
and
squirrel
one
bird
nest
and
one
perfect
fossil
not
a
bad
record
for
an
autumn
foray
said
linda
proudly
consulting
her
especially
when
you
remember
we
well
on
in
november
added
annie
it
will
be
something
to
enter
in
the
league
minutes
book
i
afraid
it
the
last
ramble
we
shall
get
this
year
said
miss
lever
but
i
one
or
two
nice
little
schemes
on
hand
for
the
spring
so
the
league
must
look
forward
to
next
april
will
any
one
have
any
more
tea
then
please
make
a
move
for
it
time
we
were
starting
good
old
dollikins
murmured
linda
as
the
girls
put
on
their
coats
she
at
a
foray
got
something
ripping
for
next
season
in
her
head
i
can
tell
by
the
twinkle
in
her
eye
she
ruminate
over
it
all
winter
and
drop
it
on
us
as
a
surprise
some
day
oh
thunder
yes
we
ought
to
be
starting
come
along
you
slackers
do
you
want
to
be
left
standing
on
the
platform
with
a
couple
of
hours
to
wait
for
the
next
train
then
sprint
as
hard
as
you
can

winona
went
home
at
christmas
with
a
whole
world
of
new
experiences
to
call
her
own
her
first
term
had
indeed
been
an
epoch
in
her
life
and
though
the
holidays
were
naturally
welcome
she
felt
that
she
could
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
next
session
of
school
her
family
received
her
with
a
certain
amount
of
respect
the
younger
ones
listened
enviously
to
her
accounts
of
hockey
matches
and
symposiums
and
began
to
wish
fate
had
wafted
their
fortunes
to
seaton
they
had
left
miss
harmon
little
school
and
next
term
were
expecting
with
some
apprehension
a
governess
whom
aunt
harriet
had
recommended
winona
who
after
thirteen
weeks
at
abbey
close
found
the
home
arrangements
rather
chaotic
could
not
help
privately
endorsing
miss
beach
wisdom
in
instituting
such
a
change
poor
woodward
had
been
greatly
out
of
health
for
the
last
few
months
and
kept
much
to
her
bedroom
while
the
children
had
been
running
wild
in
a
quite
deplorable
fashion
letty
who
ought
to
have
had
some
influence
over
the
others
was
the
naughtiest
of
all
and
the
ringleader
in
every
mischievous
undertaking
having
occupied
the
position
of
eldest
for
thirteen
weeks
she
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
submit
to
her
sister
authority
and
there
were
many
tussles
between
the
two
you
to
do
as
your
governess
tells
you
when
she
comes
protested
winona
on
one
particularly
urgent
occasion
all
right
grannie
retorted
letty
pertly
i
settle
that
matter
with
the
good
lady
herself
and
in
the
meantime
i
not
going
to
knuckle
under
to
you
so
do
think
it
you
need
come
back
so
precious
high
and
mighty
from
your
high
school
and
expect
to
boss
the
whole
show
here
so
there
and
winona
who
aforetime
had
been
able
to
subdue
her
unruly
sister
found
herself
baffled
for
their
mother
was
ill
and
must
not
be
disturbed
and
percy
who
might
have
been
on
her
side
would
only
lie
on
the
sofa
and
guffaw
fight
it
out
like
a
pair
of
kilkenny
cats
was
his
advice
sweep
up
the
fragments
that
remain

you

had
grown
immensely
during
this
last
term
he
was
now
seventeen
and
very
tall
though
at
present
decidedly
lanky
the
cadet
corps
at
his
school
absorbed
most
of
his
interests
he
held
emphatic
opinions
upon
the
war
and
aired
them
daily
to
his
family
over
the
morning
paper
according
to
his
accounts
matters
seemed
likely
to
make
little
progress
until
he
and
his
contemporaries
at
longworth
college
should
have
reached
military
age
and
be
able
to
take
their
due
part
in
the
struggle
at
which
happy
crisis
the
germans
would
receive
a
setback
that
would
astonish
the
kaiser
our
british
tactics
have
been
all
wrong
he
declared
i
can
tell
you
we
follow
things
out
inch
by
inch
at
longworth
and
you
should
just
hear
what
johnstone
major
has
to
say
some
of
those
generals
at
the
front
are
old
women
they
ought
to
send
them
home
and
set
them
some
knitting
to
do
if
i
the
ordering
of
affairs
i
give
the
command
to
fellows
under
new
wine
should
be
in
new
bottles
the
younger
children
listened
with
admiration
to
percy
views
on
war
topics
much
regretting
that
the
government
had
not
yet
obtained
the
benefit
of
his
advice
godfrey
even
hoped
that
the
war
would
not
be
over
before
there
was
a
chance
for
precept
to
be
put
into
practice
and
already
in
imagination
saw
his
brother
in
the
uniform
of
a
field
marshal
winona
smiled
tolerantly
she
took
percy
opinions
for
what
they
were
worth
if
his
school
report
was
anything
to
go
by
he
had
certainly
not
won
laurels
at
longworth
this
term
in
the
direction
of
brainwork
and
the
headmaster
comment
lacking
in
steady
application
had
probably
been
amply
justified
winona
was
not
altogether
happy
about
percy
these
holidays
jack
cassidy
was
spending
christmas
at
the
vicarage
and
claimed
much
of
his
time
and
the
influence
was
not
altogether
for
good
young
cassidy
had
already
given
the
vicar
his
guardian
and
former
tutor
considerable
trouble
at
he
had
run
through
a
large
proportion
of
the
money
which
had
come
to
him
at
his
majority
though
fortunately
he
could
not
touch
the
bulk
of
his
property
till
he
should
be
at
present
he
was
waiting
for
a
commission
and
amusing
himself
as
best
he
could
in
the
village
until
the
welcome
missive
should
arrive
for
lack
of
other
congenial
companions
he
sought
percy
society
neither
james
the
vicar
nor
woodward
realized
how
much
the
two
young
fellows
were
together
or
they
certainly
would
not
have
encouraged
the
intimacy
winona
who
was
just
old
enough
to
recognize
certain
undesirable
features
tackled
percy
in
private
mother
would
like
your
going
into
blue
harp
and
playing
billiards
with
jack
she
remonstrated
you
were
there
hours
yesterday
does
it
cost
a
lot
oh
jack
pays
for
it
at
least
he
settles
with
old
chubbs
i
have
a
bit
on
the
score
of
course
but
he
says
that
can
wait
a
while
improving
and
i
beat
him
yet
and
win
my
own
back
you
promised
mother
you
would
bet
again
after
what
happened
last
easter
now
do
you
go
well
i
must
say
something
if
joynson
old
joynson
may
go
and
boil
his
head
i
seventeen
now
look
here
win
if
you
going
to
turn
sneak
sneak
indeed
do
i
ever
tell
your
secrets
think
what
you
did
at
aunt
harriet
percy
changed
color
you
not
breathed
a
word
about
that
of
course
i
have
but
i
always
terrified
that
she
find
out
it
was
a
rocky
little
business
i
say
win
i
was
looking
up
wills
in
man
his
own
lawyer
if
aunt
harriet
died
intestate
all
her
estate
would
go
to
her
and
that
uncle
herbert
beach
out
in
china
the
mater
would
have
a
because
her
mother
was
only
aunt
harriet
uncle
herbert
would
just
get
the
lot
she
ought
to
make
another
will
at
once
had
you
better
tell
then
faltered
winona
tell
certainly
not
but
you
might
very
well
suggest
it
to
her
plenty
of
opportunities
as
you
living
there
bring
the
conversation
round
to
wills
and
ask
casually
if
she
made
hers
oh
i
could
yes
you
could
you
ought
to
do
it
winona
the
mater
stands
to
lose
everything
as
it
is
it
would
probably
make
aunt
harriet
look
inside
the
drawer
and
then
she
see
her
paper
was
gone
and
suspect
us
why
should
she
know
we
had
anything
to
do
with
it
the
servants
might
have
been
rummaging
i
certainly
think
it
your
duty
win
to
take
some
steps
it
was
rather
fine
to
hear
percy
preaching
duty
on
a
subject
in
which
he
was
so
plainly
a
defaulter
winona
at
first
indignantly
repudiated
the
task
he
wished
to
impose
upon
her
nevertheless
the
idea
kept
returning
and
troubling
her
she
was
sure
aunt
harriet
ought
to
know
that
the
will
had
been
destroyed
and
if
it
was
impossible
to
tell
her
outright
this
would
certainly
be
a
means
of
putting
her
on
the
track
winona
whole
soul
revolted
from
the
notion
of
speculating
upon
possible
advantages
to
be
gained
from
a
relative
death
she
would
rather
let
uncle
herbert
inherit
everything
than
interfere
for
herself
but
for
her
mother
it
was
a
different
matter
aunt
harriet
might
wish
her
goddaughter
to
receive
part
of
her
fortune
and
to
conceal
the
destruction
of
the
will
might
mean
depriving
woodward
of
a
handsome
legacy
how
to
make
miss
beach
realize
the
loss
of
the
paper
without
getting
percy
into
trouble
was
a
problem
that
might
have
perplexed
older
and
wiser
heads
meanwhile
it
was
holiday
time
and
there
were
many
more
pleasant
subjects
to
think
about
winona
christmas
present
had
been
a
small
hand
camera
the
very
thing
for
which
she
had
longed
during
the
whole
of
the
past
term
she
contemplated
it
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
now
she
would
be
able
to
join
the
photographic
club
at
school
to
go
out
on
some
of
the
saturday
afternoon
expeditions
and
to
have
a
few
of
her
prints
in
the
exhibition
she
could
take
of
the
girls
and
the
classroom
and
make
them
into
picture
postcards
to
send
to
her
mother
and
she
could
make
a
series
of
home
photos
to
hang
up
in
her
bedroom
at
abbey
close
there
seemed
no
limit
indeed
to
the
possibilities
of
her
new
camera
she
guarded
it
jealously
from
the
prying
fingers
of
the
younger
members
of
the
family
paws
off
she
commanded
anybody
who
interferes
with
this
kodak
will
quarrel
with
me
so
i
give
you
full
and
fair
warning
oh
yes
dorrie
i
dare
say
you
just
like
to
press
the
button
i
guarantee
your
fairy
fingers
to
smash
anything
it
touch
only
look
where
this
is
concerned
no
personal
familiarities
please
december
and
january
were
scarcely
propitious
months
for
the
taking
of
but
winona
attempted
some
time
exposures
with
varying
results
it
was
difficult
to
make
the
children
realize
the
necessity
of
keeping
absolutely
still
and
they
spoilt
several
of
her
plates
by
grinning
or
moving
she
secured
quite
a
nice
photo
of
the
house
however
and
several
of
the
village
and
promised
herself
better
luck
with
family
portraits
when
the
summer
came
round
again
she
turned
a
large
cupboard
in
the
attic
into
her
and
spent
many
hours
dabbling
among
chemicals
she
had
urgent
offers
of
help
but
rejected
them
steadfastly
greatly
to
the
disappointment
of
her
assistants
her
sanctum
became
a
veritable
bluebeard
chamber
for
to
prevent
possible
accidents
she
locked
the
door
and
kept
the
key
perpetually
in
her
pocket
during
the
day
time
sleeping
with
it
under
her
pillow
at
night
in
the
summer
she
meant
to
try
all
kinds
of
experiments
she
had
visions
of
rigging
up
a
shelter
made
of
leaves
and
branches
and
taking
a
series
of
magnificent
of
wild
birds
and
animals
like
those
in
the
books
by
cherry
kearton
and
she
certainly
intended
to
secure
records
of
the
sports
at
school
in
the
meantime
she
must
content
herself
with
landscape
and
still
life
have
one
of
the
de
claremont
tomb
at
any
rate
she
resolved
the
de
claremont
tomb
was
the
glory
of
ashbourne
church
it
was
of
white
marble
and
beautifully
sculptured
sir
guy
de
claremont
lay
represented
in
full
armor
with
his
lady
in
ruff
and
coif
by
his
side
six
sons
and
four
daughters
all
kneeling
were
carved
in
has
relief
round
the
side
of
the
monument
long
long
ago
in
the
middle
ages
the
de
claremonts
had
been
the
great
people
of
the
neighborhood
they
had
fought
in
the
crusades
had
taken
their
part
in
the
wars
of
the
barons
had
declared
for
the
white
rose
in
the
struggle
with
the
house
of
lancaster
and
cast
in
their
lot
for
the
king
against
oliver
cromwell
the
family
was
extinct
now
and
their
lands
had
passed
to
others
but
a
few
tattered
banners
and
an
old
helmet
still
hung
on
the
wall
of
the
side
chapel
above
the
tomb
testifying
to
their
former
achievements
from
her
seat
in
church
winona
had
a
good
view
of
the
monument
she
admired
it
immensely
and
had
often
woven
romances
about
the
good
knights
of
old
who
had
carried
those
banners
to
the
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
secure
a
satisfactory
photo
she
started
off
one
morning
at
about
eleven
when
the
light
was
likely
to
be
best
it
was
a
sunny
day
and
wonderfully
bright
for
january
she
had
meant
to
go
alone
but
the
children
were
on
the
and
tracked
her
so
she
arrived
at
the
church
door
closely
followed
by
letty
mamie
godfrey
ernie
and
dorrie
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
whether
to
send
them
straight
home
or
not
but
the
church
was
a
mile
from
highfield
and
the
mill
weir
a
place
of
fascination
to
ernie
lay
on
the
way
so
she
decided
that
it
would
be
safest
to
let
well
alone
they
imps
but
they
have
to
behave
themselves
decently
in
church
she
said
to
herself
at
present
the
conduct
of
the
family
was
exemplary
they
walked
in
on
and
talked
in
whispers
mamie
indeed
cast
an
envious
eye
towards
the
forbidden
ground
of
the
pulpit
into
which
it
was
her
ambition
some
day
to
climb
and
wave
her
arms
about
in
imitation
of
the
vicar
but
she
valiantly
restrained
her
longings
and
kept
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
chancel
letty
took
a
surreptitious
peep
at
the
organ
and
was
disappointed
to
find
it
locked
as
was
also
the
little
oak
door
that
led
up
the
winding
staircase
to
the
bell
tower
she
decided
that
the
parish
clerk
was
much
too
attentive
to
his
duties
come
along
over
here
ca
you
said
winona
suspiciously
leave
those
alone
and
tell
dorrie
she
not
to
touch
the
font
or
i
stick
her
inside
and
pop
the
lid
on
her
go
and
sit
down
all
of
you
in
that
pew
while
i
take
the
photo
the
family
for
once
complied
obediently
if
somewhat
reluctantly
it
was
better
to
play
the
part
of
spectators
than
to
be
left
out
of
the
proceedings
altogether
in
the
circumstances
they
knew
winona
had
the
and
that
if
she
ordered
them
from
the
church
there
would
be
no
appeal
they
watched
her
now
with
interest
and
enthusiasm
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
fix
her
camera
in
good
position
it
was
difficult
to
see
properly
in
the
viewfinder
and
she
wanted
to
be
quite
sure
that
when
the
head
of
sir
guy
was
safely
in
the
corner
his
feet
were
not
out
of
the
picture
at
the
left
to
say
nothing
of
the
ten
kneeling
children
underneath
it
impossible
to
get
the
wall
above
if
i
to
take
the
inscription
on
the
monument
she
declared
and
yet
i
must
leave
out
the
old
helmet
on
any
account
i
shall
take
it
down
and
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
tomb
while
i
photograph
it
it
ought
to
come
out
rather
well
there
rejecting
eager
offers
of
help
from
mamie
and
ernie
winona
climbed
up
on
to
the
stately
person
of
dame
margaret
de
claremont
and
managed
to
take
the
helmet
from
the
wooden
peg
on
which
it
was
suspended
she
posed
it
at
the
foot
of
the
monument
on
the
right
hand
side
there
a
splendid
light
from
this
window
full
sunshine
i
think
if
i
give
it
five
minutes
exposure
that
ought
to
do
the
deed
now
do
any
of
you
so
much
as
cough
or
you
disturb
the
air
the
family
felt
five
minutes
the
very
limit
of
endurance
the
moment
it
was
ended
they
dispersed
to
ease
their
strained
feelings
letty
and
ernie
walked
briskly
up
the
nave
mamie
went
to
investigate
the
stove
winona
herself
took
the
camera
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
church
to
photograph
a
jacobean
tablet
dorrie
remained
sitting
on
a
hassock
in
the
pew
she
had
a
plan
in
her
crafty
young
mind
she
wanted
to
examine
the
helmet
and
she
knew
winona
would
be
sure
to
say
paws
off
or
something
equally
offensive
and
objectionable
she
waited
till
her
sister
was
safely
out
of
the
way
then
she
stole
from
her
cover
grabbed
the
helmet
and
returned
to
the
shelter
of
the
pew
it
made
quite
an
interesting
and
fascinating
plaything
in
her
estimation
she
amused
herself
with
it
for
a
long
time
until
she
heard
winona
voice
proclaiming
that
if
they
did
trot
home
quickly
they
be
late
for
dinner
whereupon
she
popped
it
under
the
seat
and
joined
the
others
winona
of
course
ought
to
have
replaced
it
on
its
peg
on
the
wall
but
her
memory
was
far
from
perfect
and
she
completely
forgot
all
about
it
the
whole
thing
seemed
a
most
trivial
incident
but
it
had
an
amazing
sequel
on
saturday
afternoons
fisher
the
caretaker
always
came
to
sweep
and
tidy
up
the
church
in
preparation
for
sunday
she
was
a
little
thin
impulsive
woman
and
just
at
present
her
nerves
were
rather
in
a
shaky
condition
for
fear
of
zeppelins
she
lived
in
perpetual
terror
of
bombs
or
german
spies
and
always
slept
with
half
her
clothing
on
in
case
she
should
be
forced
to
get
up
in
a
hurry
and
flee
for
her
life
on
this
particular
saturday
afternoon
fisher
as
was
her
wont
washed
the
pavement
of
the
nave
and
then
took
her
broom
and
her
duster
into
the
side
chapel
nobody
sat
there
as
a
rule
so
she
did
not
give
it
very
much
attention
she
flicked
the
duster
over
the
monument
hastily
swept
the
floor
in
front
and
was
just
about
to
turn
away
having
done
her
duty
when
she
caught
sight
of
something
under
the
seat
of
a
pew
she
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
turned
as
white
as
her
own
best
linen
apron
she
divined
instantly
what
it
must
be
with
great
presence
of
mind
she
stole
softly
away
on
once
outside
the
church
she
indulged
in
a
comfortable
little
burst
of
hysterics
then
she
felt
better
and
went
to
tell
the
parish
clerk
before
evening
the
news
had
spread
all
over
the
village
it
was
brought
in
a
motor
car
pikes
at
the
shop
informed
her
customers
and
wilson
little
boy
says
he
heard
them
talking
german
there
was
a
sort
of
a
chap
rode
past
our
house
on
a
bicycle
the
other
day
volunteered
the
blacksmith
assistant
you
never
know
where
you
are
with
strangers
in
war
time
said
another
everybody
agreed
that
it
was
a
mercy
fisher
had
seen
it
when
she
did
and
they
were
glad
the
church
was
a
goodish
way
from
the
village
the
woodward
family
generally
started
off
for
service
almost
directly
after
the
bells
began
to
ring
on
the
following
sunday
morning
however
they
were
considerably
perplexed
the
familiar
which
ought
to
have
been
pealing
forth
was
not
to
be
heard
they
listened
in
vain
and
consulted
all
the
clocks
in
the
house
it
certainly
after
ten
said
woodward
i
afraid
something
must
have
happened
i
hope
james
is
well
we
better
go
at
any
rate
and
see
what
the
matter
so
the
family
which
was
ready
in
its
best
sunday
garments
sallied
forth
ashbourne
church
stood
a
whole
mile
away
from
the
village
in
a
lonely
spot
with
only
a
couple
of
cottages
near
it
the
woodwards
took
a
short
cut
across
the
common
from
highfield
so
that
they
did
not
pass
any
houses
or
meet
any
neighbors
by
the
way
they
arrived
at
the
church
to
find
the
door
locked
and
the
vicar
and
his
family
standing
in
consternation
outside
james
hailed
them
with
relief
so
it
sunday
he
exclaimed
i
began
to
think
we
must
have
mistaken
the
day
i
ca
understand
what
the
matter
nobody
here
except
ourselves
what
becomes
of
stevens
it
was
certainly
an
unprecedented
circumstance
to
find
choir
congregation
organist
and
verger
all
conspicuous
by
their
absence
james
went
to
the
cottages
near
to
make
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
the
first
was
locked
up
but
by
knocking
long
and
loudly
at
the
door
of
the
second
he
at
last
succeeded
in
rousing
jacob
johnson
a
deaf
old
man
of
nobody
come
to
church
he
repeated
when
after
some
difficulty
and
much
shouting
the
situation
had
been
explained
well
likely
there
should
be
i
told
there
a
german
bomb
there
one
of
the
dangerous
sort
for
going
off
some
men
brought
it
yesterday
in
a
motor
car
spies
of
the
kaiser
they
were
it
may
explode
any
minute
they
say
and
wreck
the
church
and
everything
near
the
greenwoods
next
door
locked
up
the
house
and
went
to
their
aunt
in
the
village
my
daughter
came
over
here
asking
me
to
go
home
with
her
but
i
said
stay
and
risk
it
at
one
does
care
to
move
where
is
this
bomb
asked
james
in
a
pew
nigh
the
old
monument
so
i
told
at
this
juncture
jack
cassidy
who
when
the
church
was
first
found
to
be
locked
had
volunteered
to
run
back
to
the
vicarage
and
fetch
the
vicar
own
key
now
arrived
after
a
record
sprint
give
me
a
bucket
of
water
and
i
go
and
investigate
said
james
he
came
out
of
the
church
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
holding
in
his
hand
the
old
helmet
this
is
the
nearest
approach
to
a
bomb
of
any
description
that
been
able
to
discover
he
announced
i
going
to
carry
it
to
the
village
to
convince
the
wiseacres
there
perhaps
stevens
will
pluck
up
courage
to
ring
the
bell
for
afternoon
service
if
not
i
ring
it
myself
winona
share
in
the
business
might
have
remained
concealed
but
for
the
indiscretion
of
mamie
who
by
an
incautious
remark
gave
the
show
away
entirely
you
little
silly
scolded
winona
afterwards
what
possessed
you
to
go
and
say
anything
at
all
james
will
never
forgive
me
i
could
see
it
in
his
eye
and
james
was
ice
itself
i
never
felt
so
horrible
in
all
my
life
if
you
only
had
the
sense
to
keep
mum
they
might
never
have
found
out
you
kids
are
the
most
frightful
nuisance
if
had
my
choice
given
me
when
i
was
born
i
would
have
been
an
eldest
sister
chapter
ix
the
school
service
badge
settling
down
at
abbey
close
after
a
month
at
highfield
was
like
transferring
oneself
from
a
noisy
farmyard
to
the
calm
of
the
cloister
the
house
was
so
near
to
the
minster
that
it
seemed
pervaded
by
the
quiet
cathedral
atmosphere
when
winona
drew
up
her
blinds
in
the
morning
the
first
sight
that
greeted
her
would
be
the
grey
old
towers
and
carved
pinnacles
exactly
opposite
where
the
jackdaws
were
chattering
and
the
pigeons
wheeling
round
and
the
big
clock
was
going
through
the
chimes
and
striking
the
hour
of
seven
there
was
a
particular
gargoyle
at
the
corner
of
the
transept
roof
which
appeared
to
be
grinning
at
her
across
the
road
as
if
some
imp
were
imprisoned
in
the
stone
image
and
were
peeping
out
of
its
fantastic
eyes
winona
had
grown
to
love
the
minster
she
would
go
in
whenever
she
had
ten
minutes
to
spare
after
school
the
glorious
arches
and
pillars
the
carved
choir
stalls
the
light
falling
through
the
splendid
rich
windows
on
to
the
marble
pavement
all
appealed
to
the
artistic
sense
that
was
stirring
in
her
and
gave
her
immense
satisfaction
but
even
the
beauty
of
the
cathedral
was
as
nothing
when
the
organ
began
to
play
holmes
the
organist
was
a
great
musician
and
could
manage
his
instrument
with
a
wizard
touch
in
the
afternoons
between
four
and
five
he
was
wont
to
practice
his
voluntaries
and
to
listen
to
these
took
winona
into
a
new
world
of
sound
he
was
a
disciple
of
the
extreme
modern
school
of
music
and
his
interpretations
of
debussy
césar
franck
medtner
and
glazounow
came
to
her
as
a
revelation
the
glorious
weird
harmonies
the
strange
unaccustomed
chords
of
these
stirred
her
like
the
memory
of
something
long
forgotten
as
whose
knowledge
of
hindustani
faded
with
their
childhood
yet
start
and
thrill
at
the
sound
of
the
once
familiar
language
so
this
brought
haunting
elusive
suggestions
too
subtle
to
be
defined
it
held
a
distinct
part
in
winona
development
the
girl
was
growing
up
suddenly
in
the
almost
nursery
atmosphere
of
highfield
with
nothing
to
stimulate
her
faculties
she
had
remained
at
a
very
childish
stage
but
now
with
a
world
of
art
music
science
and
literature
dawning
round
her
she
seemed
to
leap
upward
to
the
level
of
her
new
intellectual
horizon
it
is
a
glorious
time
when
we
first
begin
to
reap
the
inheritance
of
the
ages
and
to
discover
the
rich
stores
of
delight
that
master
minds
have
laid
up
for
us
to
enjoy
life
was
moving
very
fast
to
winona
she
could
not
analyze
all
her
fresh
thoughts
and
impressions
but
she
felt
she
could
no
more
go
back
to
her
last
mental
outlook
than
she
could
have
worn
the
long
clothes
of
her
babyhood
she
was
sixteen
now
for
her
birthday
fell
on
the
of
january
somehow
sixteen
sounded
so
infinitely
older
than
fifteen
there
was
a
dignity
about
it
and
a
sense
of
importance
in
another
year
she
would
actually
be
sweet
seventeen
and
a
member
of
that
enviable
school
hierarchy
the
sixth
form
winona
could
have
made
herself
thoroughly
happy
at
abbey
close
but
for
the
shadow
that
existed
between
herself
and
aunt
harriet
percy
secret
was
a
perpetual
burden
on
her
conscience
at
meal
times
she
would
often
find
her
eyes
wandering
towards
the
oak
cupboard
and
would
start
guiltily
hoping
miss
beach
had
not
noticed
the
more
she
thought
about
the
subject
the
more
convinced
she
became
that
she
ought
to
give
some
hint
of
the
state
of
affairs
though
how
to
do
so
without
implicating
her
brother
was
at
present
beyond
her
calculations
one
day
however
a
really
hopeful
opportunity
seemed
to
arise
a
case
of
a
disputed
will
was
being
tried
at
the
seaton
sessions
the
defendants
were
friends
of
miss
beach
and
after
reading
the
account
of
the
proceedings
aunt
harriet
laid
down
the
local
paper
with
a
few
comments
i
suppose
people
ought
to
make
their
wills
very
fast
and
firm
said
winona
it
was
seldom
she
ventured
on
an
independent
remark
as
a
rule
she
left
her
aunt
to
do
the
talking
undoubtedly
nothing
causes
more
trouble
than
carelessness
in
this
respect
ought
we
all
to
make
wills
if
we
have
anything
to
leave
it
advisable
ought
i
well
hardly
at
present
i
should
say
ought
mother
winona
was
growing
redder
and
redder
no
doubt
she
has
done
so
have
you
made
yours
aunt
harriet
the
horrible
deed
was
done
and
winona
crimson
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
felt
she
had
metaphorically
speaking
burnt
her
boats
miss
beach
stared
at
her
as
if
electrified
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
she
asked
suspiciously
i
think
decidedly
my
business
and
not
yours
winona
collapsed
utterly
and
murmuring
something
about
preparation
fled
to
her
bedroom
there
i
just
gone
and
put
my
foot
in
it
altogether
she
groaned
i
no
tact
i
went
and
blurted
it
out
like
an
idiot
she
never
forgive
me
oh
why
ca
i
go
and
tell
her
the
whole
business
and
then
she
understand
i
do
hate
this
sneaking
work
percy
you
wretched
boy
i
like
to
bump
your
head
against
the
wall
it
too
bad
to
land
me
in
your
scrape
well
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
i
said
it
and
done
but
i
know
i
be
in
disgrace
for
evermore
certainly
aunt
harriet
manner
towards
winona
after
this
unfortunate
episode
was
stiffer
than
formerly
she
was
perfectly
kind
but
the
gulf
between
them
had
widened
they
still
discussed
conventional
topics
at
or
rather
miss
beach
made
leading
remarks
and
winona
said
yes
or
no
for
such
a
conversation
could
hardly
be
termed
discussion
the
girl
felt
it
a
relief
when
as
often
happened
her
aunt
took
refugein
a
book
occasionally
winona
would
pluck
up
courage
to
relate
news
from
her
home
letters
but
of
her
school
life
and
all
her
new
impressions
and
interests
she
scarcely
spoke
at
all
judging
from
the
children
correspondence
the
new
governess
at
highfield
after
a
stormy
beginning
was
making
some
impressions
upon
her
wild
little
pupils
i
hated
her
at
first
wrote
mamie
but
she
tells
us
the
most
lovely
fairy
tales
and
we
learning
to
model
in
clay
i
like
it
because
it
makes
such
a
mess
ernie
smacked
her
yesterday
and
she
would
let
him
do
his
painting
till
he
said
he
was
sorry
winona
laughed
over
the
letters
picturing
the
lively
scenes
that
must
be
taking
place
at
home
do
the
kids
a
world
of
good
she
commented
they
were
running
to
seed
even
i
could
see
that
as
long
ago
as
last
summer
and
i
mind
confessing
quite
to
myself
that
i
was
fairly
raw
then
i
know
very
much
about
anything
till
i
came
to
the
high
winona
second
term
was
running
far
more
smoothly
than
her
first
thanks
to
miss
lever
coaching
she
could
now
hold
her
own
in
her
form
and
though
she
might
not
be
the
most
shining
light
at
any
rate
she
was
not
numbered
among
the
slackers
her
progress
was
marked
in
more
quarters
than
she
suspected
margaret
howell
had
had
the
scholarship
winners
under
observation
ever
since
their
arrival
as
head
girl
she
made
it
her
business
to
know
something
about
every
girl
in
the
school
the
general
as
she
was
nicknamed
was
universally
voted
a
success
she
and
kirsty
paterson
between
them
had
organized
a
new
era
of
things
every
one
felt
the
seaton
high
was
waking
up
and
beginning
to
found
a
reputation
for
itself
the
various
guilds
and
societies
were
prospering
and
following
margaret
pet
motto
pro
bono
publico
had
exterminated
private
quarrels
and
instituted
the
most
proceedings
and
the
strictest
civility
at
committee
meetings
already
the
general
tone
was
raised
immeasurably
and
public
spirit
and
school
patriotism
ran
high
to
encourage
zeal
and
strenuousness
margaret
and
kirsty
had
laid
their
heads
together
and
decided
to
found
what
they
called
the
order
of
distinguished
school
service
any
girl
who
was
considered
to
have
performed
some
action
worthy
of
special
commendation
or
who
had
otherwise
contributed
to
the
general
benefit
was
to
be
rewarded
with
a
badge
and
her
name
was
to
be
chronicled
in
a
book
kept
for
the
purpose
the
very
first
to
gain
the
honor
was
little
daisy
hicks
a
second
form
child
who
won
marks
out
of
a
possible
in
the
christmas
exams
so
far
the
highest
score
known
in
the
school
agnes
heath
who
wrung
special
praise
from
the
doctor
who
conducted
the
ambulance
examination
and
gladys
vickcrs
whose
photograph
of
the
hockey
team
was
published
in
the
seaton
were
also
placed
upon
the
distinguished
list
having
substantially
helped
the
credit
of
the
school
the
badge
was
only
a
rosette
made
of
narrow
ribbons
stitched
in
tiny
loops
into
the
form
of
a
daisy
with
a
yellow
disk
and
white
and
pink
outer
rays
if
meant
very
much
however
to
the
recipient
who
knew
that
her
name
would
be
handed
down
to
posterity
in
the
school
traditions
and
every
girl
was
immensely
keen
to
earn
it
a
new
institution
in
the
school
this
term
was
the
foundation
of
a
library
it
had
been
a
pet
project
of
margaret
ever
since
her
appointment
as
head
prefect
just
before
the
christmas
breaking
up
she
had
called
a
general
meeting
and
begged
everybody
after
the
holidays
to
present
at
least
one
contribution
it
may
be
a
new
book
or
an
old
one
she
had
explained
but
it
must
be
really
interesting
please
do
bring
rubbish
give
something
you
would
enjoy
reading
yourself
and
can
recommend
to
your
friends
the
response
to
her
appeal
had
been
greater
than
she
anticipated
nobody
failed
to
comply
and
some
of
the
girls
brought
several
books
apiece
a
start
was
made
with
three
hundred
and
volumes
which
was
regarded
as
a
most
creditable
beginning
for
the
present
they
were
piled
up
in
the
prefects
room
until
shelves
had
been
made
to
receive
them
miss
bishop
had
given
the
order
to
the
joiner
but
owing
to
the
war
it
might
be
some
time
before
the
work
was
finished
meanwhile
margaret
decided
that
the
books
ought
to
be
catalogued
and
labeled
so
that
they
would
be
quite
ready
when
the
bookcases
arrived
she
cast
about
for
helpers
in
this
rather
arduous
task
and
her
choice
fell
upon
winona
who
happened
to
have
a
spare
between
her
classes
on
tuesday
and
thursday
afternoons
winona
immensely
flattered
accepted
the
responsibility
with
glee
and
was
put
to
work
under
the
general
directions
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
sorting
dusting
pasting
on
labels
and
making
alphabetical
lists
i
should
mind
being
a
librarian
some
day
in
a
big
public
library
she
assured
ellinor
cooper
her
you
have
to
be
quicker
than
you
are
at
present
then
remarked
margaret
dryly
they
would
think
you
worth
your
salt
if
you
spent
all
your
time
reading
the
books
buck
up
ca
you
and
get
on
at
which
winona
guiltily
shut
shirley
with
a
bang
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
while
margaret
was
cultivating
the
intellectual
side
of
the
school
kirsty
was
carefully
attending
to
her
duties
as
games
captain
her
work
among
the
juniors
prospered
exceedingly
they
were
taking
to
hockey
with
wild
enthusiasm
and
gave
evidence
of
considerable
promise
as
most
of
them
were
free
at
three
they
got
the
chance
of
playing
almost
every
day
kirsty
was
extremely
anxious
that
these
practices
should
be
properly
supervised
she
was
too
busy
herself
to
take
them
personally
so
she
was
obliged
to
delegate
the
work
to
anybody
who
had
the
spare
time
the
girls
i
want
most
are
all
at
classes
or
music
lessons
she
lamented
not
a
single
one
of
the
team
available
winona
woodward
i
been
looking
at
your
and
find
you
two
vacant
would
you
like
to
help
like
i
sell
my
birthright
to
do
it
gasped
winona
but
fearfully
sorry
i
cataloguing
for
margaret
then
i
must
take
you
away
from
the
general
it
a
nuisance
though
for
you
have
done
very
well
and
i
do
know
who
else
i
can
get
winona
considered
it
was
one
of
the
sharpest
disappointments
she
had
ever
gone
through
oh
the
grizzly
bad
luck
of
it
she
wailed
to
garnet
it
would
have
been
idyllic
to
coach
those
kids
and
it
would
have
given
me
such
a
leg
up
with
kirsty
to
think
i
lost
my
chance
i
suppose
margaret
might
get
some
one
else
to
do
cataloguing
i
dare
say
but
i
could
possibly
ask
her
and
i
sure
kirsty
wo
no
i
done
for
school
etiquette
is
very
strict
and
winona
would
have
perished
sooner
than
resign
her
library
duties
she
felt
a
martyr
but
resolved
to
smile
through
it
all
garnet
contemplated
the
problem
at
leisure
during
her
drawing
lesson
and
arrived
at
a
daring
conclusion
without
consulting
her
friend
she
marched
off
at
four
to
the
prefects
room
a
little
sanctum
on
the
ground
floor
where
the
minutes
books
of
the
various
guilds
and
societies
were
kept
and
where
the
school
officers
could
hold
meetings
and
transact
business
as
she
expected
margaret
was
there
alone
and
said
come
in
in
answer
to
her
rap
at
the
door
the
members
of
the
sixth
kept
much
on
their
dignity
so
it
was
rather
a
formidable
undertaking
even
for
a
fifth
form
girl
to
interrupt
the
head
of
the
school
margaret
looked
up
inquiringly
as
garnet
entered
yes
i
fearfully
busy
she
replied
to
the
murmured
question
what
is
it
i
can
give
you
five
minutes
but
no
more
so
please
be
brief
thus
urged
garnet
though
greatly
embarrassed
did
not
beat
about
the
bush
i
come
to
ask
a
frightfully
cheeky
thing
she
blurted
out
kirsty
wants
winona
to
coach
the
kids
at
hockey
and
winona
cataloguing
for
you
so
of
course
she
ca
and
but
here
garnet
courage
failed
her
so
she
paused
do
you
mean
that
winona
would
prefer
to
help
with
the
juniors
she
be
torn
in
pieces
rather
than
let
me
say
so
but
she
just
crazy
over
hockey
i
hope
i
have
made
any
mischief
win
does
know
come
all
right
i
understand
i
see
what
can
be
done
in
the
matter
returned
the
general
opening
her
books
as
a
sign
of
dismissal
garnet
was
not
at
all
sure
whether
her
mission
had
succeeded
or
the
reverse
but
the
next
day
margaret
sent
for
winona
i
hear
kirsty
wants
you
for
a
hockey
coach
just
at
present
i
think
games
are
of
more
importance
in
the
school
than
the
library
so
please
report
yourself
to
her
and
say
i
taken
your
name
off
my
list
done
very
well
here
but
i
going
to
lend
you
to
kirsty
for
a
while
winona
was
so
astounded
she
hardly
knew
whether
to
stammer
out
apologies
gratitude
or
regrets
and
was
intensely
relieved
when
the
head
girl
cut
her
short
kindly
but
firmly
and
sent
her
away
she
lost
no
time
in
seeking
out
the
games
captain
very
decent
of
margaret
remarked
kirsty
it
got
me
out
of
a
hole
for
i
could
find
anybody
else
with
that
special
time
free
you
do
your
best
i
know
beamed
winona
ecstatically
under
her
tuition
the
children
play
improved
fast
kirsty
said
little
she
was
not
given
to
people
but
winona
felt
she
noticed
and
approved
among
the
season
fixtures
perhaps
the
most
important
was
the
match
with
the
seaton
ladies
hockey
club
that
was
to
come
off
on
march
their
opponents
possessed
a
fair
reputation
in
the
city
so
it
would
behove
the
school
to
play
up
for
all
they
were
worth
as
kirsty
expressed
it
it
would
be
a
glorious
opportunity
of
showing
their
capabilities
to
the
world
at
large
and
demonstrating
that
they
meant
to
take
their
due
place
in
local
athletics
three
days
before
the
event
kirsty
appeared
in
the
morning
with
the
air
of
a
tragedy
queen
what
the
matter
queried
patricia
you
a
face
as
long
as
a
fiddle
matter
enough
barbara
jennings
is
laid
up
with
influenza
become
of
the
match
i
do
know
it
makes
me
feel
rocky
margaret
i
want
to
confab
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
grizzly
luck
in
your
life
at
five
minutes
past
eleven
when
winona
was
eating
her
lunch
in
the
gymnasium
kirsty
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
i
something
to
tell
you
winona
woodward
you
to
play
for
the
school
on
saturday
instead
of
barbara
winona
swallowed
a
piece
of
biscuit
with
foolhardy
haste
she
could
scarcely
believe
the
news
so
great
was
its
magnitude
to
be
asked
to
fill
a
vacant
place
in
the
team
was
beyond
her
wildest
dreams
thanks
most
she
stammered
with
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
through
the
next
few
days
winona
simply
lived
for
saturday
to
be
able
to
represent
the
school
the
glorious
thought
was
never
for
a
moment
absent
from
her
mind
she
even
ventured
to
tell
aunt
harriet
the
honor
that
had
been
thrust
upon
her
and
was
astonished
at
the
interest
with
which
her
information
was
received
on
the
saturday
afternoon
the
high
school
turned
up
almost
in
full
force
to
view
the
match
juniors
were
keen
as
seniors
and
the
children
whom
winona
had
coached
were
wild
with
excitement
the
field
was
packed
with
spectators
for
the
ladies
club
had
brought
many
friends
it
was
even
rumored
that
a
reporter
from
the
seaton
was
present
the
high
school
team
in
navy
blue
gymnasium
costumes
bare
heads
and
pigtails
looked
neat
and
trim
and
very
a
much
fitter
set
than
we
showed
last
year
murmured
margaret
with
satisfaction
all
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
field
as
the
two
opponents
stood
out
to
bully
and
the
sticks
first
clashed
together
winona
her
face
aglow
with
excitement
waited
a
chance
to
run
a
little
later
her
opportunity
came
she
dashed
into
the
masses
of
the
opponents
force
and
with
one
magnificent
stroke
swept
the
ball
well
onward
towards
the
goal
oh
how
precious
shouted
the
girls
nobody
had
imagined
winona
capable
of
such
a
feat
she
at
once
became
the
focus
of
all
eyes
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
high
school
that
there
was
a
real
possibility
of
their
winning
the
match
they
had
expected
to
make
a
gallant
fight
and
be
defeated
retiring
with
all
the
honors
of
war
perhaps
the
ladies
club
team
who
had
come
to
the
field
secure
of
victory
began
to
feel
pangs
of
uneasiness
under
their
white
jerseys
the
situation
was
supreme
the
score
had
become
even
could
the
school
possibly
do
it
that
was
the
question
all
looked
to
winona
for
the
answer
she
was
playing
like
one
inspired
she
had
not
realized
her
own
capacities
before
the
wild
excitement
of
the
moment
seemed
to
lend
wings
to
her
feet
and
strength
and
skill
to
her
arm
one
heroic
stroke
and
the
ball
was
spinning
between
the
posts
it
was
a
magnificent
finish
frantic
applause
rose
up
from
the
spectators
the
high
school
cheered
its
champions
in
a
glorious
roar
of
victory
the
ladies
club
team
were
magnanimous
enough
to
offer
congratulations
and
their
captain
shook
hands
with
winona
glad
to
see
how
your
standard
gone
up
she
remarked
to
kirsty
aside
that
of
yours
is
worth
her
salt
kirsty
was
literally
purring
with
satisfaction
last
year
the
high
school
had
been
badly
beaten
in
more
than
half
its
matches
this
was
indeed
a
new
page
in
its
records
on
monday
morning
winona
received
a
message
summoning
her
to
the
prefects
room
she
found
margaret
kirsty
and
the
other
school
officers
assembled
there
winona
woodward
said
the
head
girl
we
have
decided
to
present
you
with
the
school
service
badge
in
recognition
of
your
play
on
saturday
it
is
felt
that
you
really
secured
the
match
and
as
this
is
our
first
great
victory
we
consider
you
deserve
to
have
it
recorded
in
your
favor
your
name
has
been
entered
in
the
book
come
here
winona
turned
crimson
as
margaret
pinned
the
daisy
badge
on
to
her
blouse
i
i
been
only
too
proud
to
do
what
i
can
she
blurted
out
thanks
most
chapter
x
a
scare
the
spring
term
came
to
a
close
with
a
very
fair
number
of
hockey
successes
to
be
placed
to
the
credit
of
the
seaton
high
school
compared
with
last
year
record
it
was
indeed
a
great
improvement
and
kirsty
felt
that
though
they
had
not
yet
established
a
games
reputation
they
at
any
rate
showed
good
promise
of
future
achievements
she
hoped
to
do
much
in
the
cricket
and
tennis
season
though
she
certainly
acknowledged
there
was
much
to
be
done
the
cricket
so
far
had
been
such
a
business
that
she
doubted
the
advisability
of
making
any
fixtures
i
believe
we
just
better
train
up
for
all
we
worth
she
said
at
the
committee
meeting
it
take
ages
to
lick
an
eleven
into
shape
what
we
want
is
to
get
a
cricket
atmosphere
into
the
school
you
develop
these
things
all
in
a
few
weeks
you
got
to
catch
your
kids
young
and
teach
them
before
you
get
a
school
with
a
reputation
i
feel
with
all
the
games
that
we
simply
building
foundations
at
present
at
the
seaton
high
this
term
especially
is
i
do
all
i
can
to
get
things
going
but
it
will
be
the
games
captain
who
comes
after
me
who
reap
the
reward
ca
you
stay
on
another
year
suggested
patricia
wish
i
could
for
some
things
but
it
impossible
no
i
do
my
bit
this
term
and
then
hand
over
the
job
to
my
successor
as
i
said
before
what
we
want
now
is
a
good
start
kirsty
was
a
capital
organizer
she
soon
recognized
a
girl
capacities
and
she
had
a
knack
of
inspiring
enthusiasm
even
in
apparent
slackers
she
worked
thoroughly
hard
herself
and
insisted
that
everybody
else
did
the
same
her
motto
for
the
term
was
the
athletic
education
of
the
rank
and
file
it
was
really
very
of
her
for
she
might
have
gained
far
more
credit
by
concentrating
her
energies
on
a
few
but
for
the
ultimate
good
of
the
school
it
was
undoubtedly
far
and
away
the
best
policy
to
pursue
the
training
of
a
number
of
recruits
may
not
be
as
interesting
as
the
polishing
up
of
champions
but
in
time
recruits
become
veterans
and
a
school
in
which
the
standard
of
the
ordinary
play
is
very
high
has
a
better
general
chance
than
one
that
depends
on
an
occasional
star
so
even
the
little
girls
were
strictly
supervised
in
their
practices
and
both
cricket
and
tennis
showed
healthy
development
the
governors
and
the
head
mistress
were
anxious
that
the
games
department
should
prosper
and
gave
every
encouragement
there
were
a
larger
number
of
tennis
courts
provided
than
fall
to
the
share
of
most
schools
and
each
form
had
its
allotted
times
for
play
athletics
were
indeed
compulsory
every
girl
being
required
to
take
her
due
part
unless
she
were
excused
by
a
medical
certificate
winona
worked
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
as
a
fifth
form
girl
she
had
of
course
to
be
rather
humble
towards
the
sixth
but
she
felt
that
kirsty
approved
of
her
it
was
never
kirsty
way
to
praise
and
she
could
be
scathing
in
her
remarks
sometimes
but
winona
did
not
mind
criticism
from
her
captain
and
acted
so
well
on
all
the
advice
given
that
she
was
making
rapid
strides
in
pursuance
of
kirsty
training
policy
she
was
not
allowed
to
specialize
in
either
tennis
or
cricket
this
summer
but
to
give
equal
energy
to
both
so
she
practiced
bowling
under
hester
king
careful
supervision
and
played
exciting
sets
while
clarice
nixon
stood
by
to
watch
and
score
the
games
appealed
to
winona
more
than
any
other
part
of
the
school
curriculum
she
did
fairly
well
now
in
her
form
work
but
she
knew
she
could
never
be
clever
like
garnet
and
that
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
she
would
win
laurels
on
her
books
she
had
promised
miss
bishop
that
she
would
try
to
do
credit
to
the
school
in
return
for
her
scholarship
and
to
help
to
raise
its
athletic
reputation
seemed
her
most
feasible
method
of
success
i
could
never
get
a
college
scholarship
however
i
tried
she
thought
but
i
wo
say
it
probable
but
it
just
possible
that
i
might
do
something
some
day
in
the
way
of
winning
matches
miss
bishop
would
be
pleased
at
that
the
early
summer
was
delightful
at
seaton
the
park
opposite
the
school
was
full
of
tulips
and
hyacinths
and
the
long
avenue
of
trees
in
the
abbey
close
had
burst
into
tender
green
foliage
winona
studied
her
home
lessons
sitting
by
her
open
bedroom
window
with
a
leafy
bower
outside
and
an
accompaniment
of
jackdaws
cawing
in
the
old
towers
of
the
minster
she
loved
this
window
and
the
prospect
from
it
there
was
a
romantic
flavor
about
the
gray
pile
opposite
its
carvings
and
cloisters
and
chiming
bells
seemed
so
peaceful
and
so
far
removed
from
modern
trouble
sometimes
indeed
the
whirr
of
a
biplane
would
disturb
the
quiet
as
an
airman
flittered
like
a
great
over
the
city
reminding
her
that
medieval
times
were
past
while
a
bugle
call
from
the
neighboring
barracks
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
world
was
at
war
not
that
winona
was
likely
to
forget
that
every
day
in
school
the
peace
bell
prayer
was
read
at
noon
and
she
might
see
regiments
of
recruits
marching
up
or
down
the
high
street
on
their
way
to
their
training
grounds
nearly
every
girl
in
had
some
relation
at
the
front
and
though
winona
could
not
boast
of
anybody
nearer
than
a
third
cousin
serving
somewhere
in
france
she
looked
for
news
as
eagerly
as
the
rest
it
must
be
glorious
to
get
letters
from
the
trenches
she
said
half
wistfully
one
day
to
beatrice
howell
who
was
exulting
over
a
pencil
scrawl
written
by
her
brother
in
a
i
half
wish
no
you
do
snapped
beatrice
it
a
nightmare
to
have
them
in
the
firing
line
be
thankful
your
brother
still
safe
at
school
on
the
subject
of
percy
winona
was
far
from
easy
he
had
let
fall
one
or
two
hints
during
the
easter
holidays
which
confirmed
her
previous
suspicion
that
he
had
got
into
a
wrong
set
at
longworth
college
he
had
written
to
her
twice
already
this
term
wanting
to
borrow
money
and
suggesting
that
without
mentioning
his
name
she
should
ask
miss
beach
to
lend
it
to
her
with
such
a
request
however
winona
had
utterly
refused
to
comply
aunt
harriet
has
been
so
decent
to
us
i
ca
begin
to
sponge
on
her
she
wrote
back
besides
she
want
to
know
what
i
wanted
such
a
lot
for
and
then
all
the
mischief
would
be
out
apparently
percy
was
offended
for
his
usual
weekly
letter
did
not
appear
winona
only
laughed
expecting
he
would
soon
get
over
his
fit
of
sulks
she
was
utterly
unprepared
for
the
sequel
one
day
she
received
a
note
from
him
written
on
paper
and
headed
horminster
it
ran
thus
dear
win
i
got
into
such
an
altogether
grizzly
hole
that
there
was
only
one
way
out
and
i
taken
it
i
am
at
present
a
member
of
his
majesty
forces
and
if
you
want
to
write
to
me
address
private
woodward
battalion
royal
rytonshire
fusiliers
horminster
your
affectionate
brother
percy
you
can
tell
the
mater
if
you
like
winona
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
showed
the
note
to
aunt
harriet
who
telegraphed
the
information
to
woodward
the
latter
had
just
heard
from
percy
housemaster
of
his
disappearance
and
was
greatly
relieved
to
have
news
of
his
whereabouts
the
runaway
was
below
military
age
and
his
mother
first
impulse
was
to
apply
for
his
immediate
discharge
but
from
this
course
her
best
friends
dissuaded
her
the
headmaster
of
longworth
college
and
joynson
her
trustee
were
unanimous
in
counseling
her
to
leave
the
boy
alone
and
aunt
harriet
cordially
agreed
with
them
let
the
lad
serve
his
country
she
wrote
to
her
niece
he
is
tall
for
his
age
and
if
the
military
authorities
have
accepted
him
well
and
good
it
seems
to
me
the
one
thing
in
the
world
that
is
likely
to
steady
him
and
give
him
that
sense
of
responsibility
that
hitherto
he
has
so
signally
lacked
you
will
make
the
mistake
of
your
life
if
you
keep
him
back
now
it
seemed
funny
to
winona
to
imagine
percy
so
young
and
boyish
actually
in
his
majesty
uniform
he
had
not
yet
got
his
khaki
but
he
promised
to
have
a
photo
taken
as
soon
as
ever
he
was
in
military
garb
and
she
looked
forward
to
showing
the
portrait
of
her
soldier
brother
to
the
girls
in
her
form
she
began
a
pair
of
socks
for
him
at
once
i
regret
to
say
that
winona
patriotic
knitting
had
languished
very
much
during
the
last
two
terms
but
this
personal
stimulus
revived
her
ardor
she
even
took
her
sock
to
the
tennis
court
and
emulating
the
example
of
patricia
marshall
and
several
other
enthusiasts
got
quite
good
pieces
done
between
the
sets
she
would
have
taken
it
to
cricket
also
but
kirsty
had
sternly
made
a
prohibiting
all
knitting
on
the
pitch
since
ellinor
cooper
when
supposed
to
be
fielding
had
surreptitiously
taken
her
work
from
her
pocket
and
missed
the
best
catch
of
the
afternoon
to
her
everlasting
disgrace
and
the
scorn
of
the
indignant
games
captain
kirsty
was
keen
at
present
upon
each
form
having
its
own
eleven
and
had
arranged
some
school
matches
as
trials
of
skill
the
first
of
these
sixth
fifth
was
fixed
for
the
following
saturday
afternoon
winona
to
her
ecstatic
and
delirious
delight
had
been
elected
captain
of
the
combined
and
eleven
and
she
was
looking
forward
to
the
contest
as
one
of
the
events
of
her
life
she
was
aware
that
on
its
success
or
failure
might
hang
much
of
her
future
athletic
career
at
school
and
she
was
determined
to
show
of
what
stuff
she
was
made
she
urged
her
team
to
make
heroic
efforts
and
got
all
the
practice
in
that
was
available
on
the
thursday
afternoon
she
gave
everybody
a
final
drilling
on
friday
the
pitch
would
be
the
property
of
the
lower
school
so
this
was
the
last
opportunity
of
play
before
the
match
if
any
of
you
muff
the
ball
or
do
anything
stupid
i
never
forgive
you
she
assured
her
eleven
the
sixth
are
at
fielding
so
for
goodness
sake
do
disgrace
our
form
beware
of
patricia
bowling
it
looks
simple
but
it
the
nastiest
i
know
i
rather
have
kirsty
any
day
because
at
least
you
know
what
to
expect
from
her
and
you
on
your
guard
do
try
to
be
clever
too
soon
it
better
not
to
score
at
all
during
the
first
over
than
to
run
any
risks
evelyn
you
were
a
mascot
i
hope
you
play
up
equally
well
on
saturday
by
the
by
joyce
i
really
ca
compliment
you
on
your
innings
what
were
you
thinking
of
to
make
that
idiotic
blind
swipe
i
do
know
returned
joyce
dolefully
she
was
sitting
on
the
fence
looking
decidedly
crestfallen
i
afraid
i
rather
rocky
somehow
got
nerves
girl
alive
do
brace
up
no
it
not
nerves
my
head
been
aching
all
the
week
and
i
a
pain
across
my
chest
and
i
keep
shivering
i
suppose
i
must
have
caught
cold
it
be
a
grizzly
nuisance
if
i
ca
play
on
saturday
you
play
urged
winona
we
got
to
beat
the
sixth
or
perish
in
the
attempt
you
go
home
at
once
and
get
some
hot
tea
and
go
to
bed
afterwards
if
you
do
feel
better
you
may
stop
in
bed
all
if
it
do
you
good
thank
you
grannie
perhaps
i
will
go
home
now
i
really
am
feeling
rather
queer
she
looks
queer
too
said
bessie
kirk
to
winona
as
they
stood
watching
joyce
retreating
figure
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
a
while
ago
it
be
a
hideous
nuisance
if
she
has
to
be
out
of
it
our
best
bowler
it
unthinkable
groaned
winona
it
hard
luck
but
i
certain
joyce
wo
play
on
saturday
said
mary
payne
the
team
was
feeling
rather
down
at
the
prospect
we
may
throw
up
the
sponge
if
joyce
is
off
mourned
olave
parry
shut
up
you
bluebottle
snapped
winona
decidedly
out
of
temper
joyce
may
be
absolutely
well
again
by
saturday
and
if
she
marjorie
kemp
must
take
her
place
do
be
sporting
you
never
win
if
you
make
up
your
mind
beforehand
that
you
going
to
lose
when
winona
walked
into
on
the
following
morning
she
looked
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
joyce
desk
but
the
familiar
check
dress
and
amber
pigtail
were
not
to
be
seen
little
groups
of
girls
were
standing
in
clusters
talking
in
apparent
consternation
well
have
you
heard
the
news
asked
garnet
stepping
forward
to
meet
her
friend
no
what
the
damage
you
looking
very
down
in
the
dumps
joyce
newton
has
developed
nonsense
exploded
winona
it
perfectly
true
said
garnet
with
severe
dignity
in
her
voice
one
only
wishes
for
joyce
sake
that
it
was
the
news
has
only
just
come
helena
maitland
knows
about
it
she
lives
next
door
and
saw
the
doctor
car
at
the
newtons
gate
this
morning
i
told
you
joyce
looked
queer
yesterday
said
bessie
kirk
suppose
we
all
catch
it
shuddered
freda
long
do
it
too
horrible
there
was
a
feeling
of
utter
consternation
among
the
girls
as
the
bad
news
was
discussed
they
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
miss
bishop
is
telephoning
to
the
medical
officer
of
health
volunteered
olave
parry
who
had
been
downstairs
to
seek
fresh
information
just
then
miss
huntley
came
into
the
room
though
it
was
not
yet
nine
she
went
at
once
to
her
desk
and
took
the
call
over
what
going
to
happen
about
joyce
one
or
two
of
the
girls
ventured
to
ask
her
i
do
know
yet
i
expect
we
shall
all
be
put
into
quarantine
miss
bishop
is
making
arrangements
in
the
meantime
we
will
go
on
with
our
work
it
was
wise
of
miss
huntley
to
begin
the
english
language
lesson
for
though
every
one
was
of
course
very
abstracted
it
gave
some
ostensible
occupation
before
the
hour
was
over
miss
bishop
sailed
into
the
room
she
looked
pale
and
anxious
but
spoke
with
her
usual
calm
dignity
girls
she
announced
you
have
heard
of
the
very
difficult
situation
in
which
the
school
is
placed
i
have
rung
up
barnes
the
medical
officer
of
health
and
he
tells
me
that
the
whole
of
must
be
regarded
as
cases
that
means
that
as
joyce
has
been
amongst
you
it
is
possible
for
any
of
you
to
develop
the
disease
in
order
to
avoid
the
spread
of
infection
throughout
the
city
you
will
have
to
be
most
carefully
kept
apart
i
have
sent
all
the
other
girls
home
and
you
will
stay
at
the
school
during
barnes
is
coming
this
morning
to
you
and
this
afternoon
you
are
to
be
taken
to
the
camp
at
dunheath
where
you
will
stay
until
the
period
of
quarantine
is
over
go
home
most
certainly
not
no
girl
is
to
leave
the
school
on
any
pretext
whatever
i
am
communicating
with
your
home
people
and
requesting
that
they
send
you
a
few
necessary
things
to
take
to
the
camp
but
no
personal
interviews
can
be
allowed
barnes
orders
are
most
emphatic
you
need
not
be
alarmed
for
if
you
are
all
it
is
highly
improbable
that
you
will
be
infected
and
i
think
you
will
all
enjoy
yourselves
at
dunheath
when
the
principal
had
gone
the
girls
clustered
round
miss
huntley
to
discuss
the
situation
yes
of
course
i
going
with
you
said
the
mistress
i
a
contact
case
as
much
as
anybody
else
miss
bishop
tells
me
that
barnes
will
send
a
hospital
nurse
with
us
it
a
nuisance
to
be
in
quarantine
but
it
will
be
beautiful
out
in
the
country
just
now
and
we
manage
to
enjoy
ourselves
the
girls
took
the
matter
in
various
fashions
according
to
their
respective
temperaments
some
were
nervous
while
others
regarded
it
as
a
joke
the
latter
rallied
their
more
timorous
companions
with
scant
mercy
oh
buck
up
you
sillies
said
marjorie
kemp
to
the
tearful
plaints
of
agatha
james
and
irene
mills
vaccination
does
hurt
it
nothing
but
a
scratch
you
might
be
going
to
have
your
arms
cut
off
for
goodness
sake
show
some
pluck
suppose
you
were
in
the
trenches
the
camp
will
be
just
topping
we
have
the
time
of
our
lives
if
we
do
break
out
in
spots
wailed
irene
well
wait
till
you
do
before
you
make
a
fuss
you
far
more
likely
to
catch
a
thing
if
you
afraid
of
it
oh
i
say
said
winona
suddenly
remembering
saturday
event
the
match
will
be
all
off
hold
me
up
so
it
will
what
a
grizzly
nuisance
oh
the
hard
luck
of
it
well
it
ca
be
helped
we
must
play
the
sixth
later
on
kirsty
be
as
savage
as
we
are
poor
old
joyce
she
responsible
for
a
good
deal
of
damage
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
had
the
whole
of
the
school
premises
absolutely
and
entirely
to
itself
the
fourth
form
room
was
turned
into
a
temporary
surgery
and
barnes
installed
himself
there
with
tubes
of
vaccine
and
packets
of
new
darning
needles
each
girl
in
turn
went
first
to
miss
bishop
and
had
her
arm
thoroughly
sterilized
with
boiled
water
and
boracic
lotion
and
was
then
passed
on
to
the
medical
officer
for
vaccination
the
scratch
with
the
needle
really
did
not
hurt
and
the
little
operations
were
soon
over
sixteen
maidens
walking
about
waiting
for
their
arms
to
dry
before
their
blouses
made
a
rather
comical
sight
the
giggles
that
ensued
raised
the
spirits
of
even
agatha
and
irene
glad
it
was
done
on
our
left
arms
i
expect
we
be
in
much
form
for
cricket
after
this
unless
we
play
laughed
winona
by
the
by
will
there
be
any
field
we
can
practice
on
out
at
the
camp
i
expect
so
returned
miss
huntley
you
had
better
make
a
collection
of
bats
balls
and
stumps
and
a
few
tennis
rackets
and
also
your
school
books
put
them
all
together
and
miss
bishop
will
have
them
sent
to
us
the
girls
hastened
to
sort
out
the
necessary
impedimenta
for
cricket
and
tennis
but
arranged
piles
of
books
with
less
enthusiasm
the
general
opinion
being
that
it
was
rather
stiff
to
be
expected
to
do
work
at
the
camp
they
were
each
allowed
to
take
a
book
from
the
school
library
and
miss
huntley
added
a
pile
of
foolscap
paper
pens
and
a
big
bottle
of
ink
which
the
girls
devoutly
hoped
might
get
broken
on
the
way
and
thus
save
them
the
labor
of
writing
exercises
they
had
dinner
and
a
four
tea
at
school
after
which
meal
miss
bishop
who
seemed
to
have
spent
most
of
the
day
at
the
telephone
announced
that
arrangements
were
now
completed
and
that
they
must
get
ready
to
start
great
was
the
excitement
when
at
five
a
motor
made
its
appearance
the
sixteen
contacts
and
miss
huntley
took
their
places
their
which
had
been
sent
from
their
respective
homes
during
the
course
of
the
day
were
stowed
away
with
the
rest
of
their
luggage
inside
a
motor
and
the
company
feeling
much
more
like
a
picnic
party
than
possibly
infected
cases
drove
merrily
away
for
their
period
of
quarantine
chapter
xi
the
camp
if
this
particular
friday
had
been
an
exciting
day
to
the
girls
of
it
had
certainly
proved
a
most
agitating
one
to
the
medical
officer
of
health
for
seaton
upon
his
energy
and
organization
depended
the
prevention
of
a
serious
epidemic
in
the
city
and
he
had
shown
himself
admirably
able
to
cope
with
the
sudden
emergency
the
corporation
had
lately
set
up
a
camp
for
children
threatened
with
tuberculosis
and
this
was
commandeered
by
barnes
as
a
suitable
place
for
quarantine
it
lay
five
miles
away
from
seaton
on
the
top
of
a
hill
in
a
very
open
situation
in
the
midst
of
fields
so
was
excellently
fitted
for
the
purpose
the
children
under
treatment
there
had
been
hurriedly
taken
back
to
their
homes
in
seaton
extra
beds
and
supplies
had
been
sent
out
and
a
hospital
nurse
installed
in
charge
so
that
all
was
in
readiness
when
the
arrived
the
camp
consisted
of
a
long
wooden
shelter
or
shed
the
south
side
of
which
was
entirely
open
to
the
air
the
boarded
floor
was
raised
about
three
feet
above
the
level
of
the
field
and
projected
well
beyond
the
roof
line
thus
forming
a
kind
of
terrace
inside
the
shelter
was
a
row
of
small
beds
and
a
space
was
curtained
off
at
either
end
on
one
side
for
a
kitchen
and
on
the
other
to
make
a
cubicle
for
miss
huntley
outside
under
a
large
oak
tree
stood
a
table
and
benches
nothing
could
have
been
more
absolutely
plain
and
bare
as
regards
furniture
the
girls
took
possession
however
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
the
idea
of
living
the
simple
life
appealed
to
them
who
wanted
chairs
and
chests
of
drawers
and
it
would
be
fun
to
sleep
in
the
shelter
and
spend
the
whole
day
out
of
doors
it
too
topping
for
anything
declared
marjorie
kemp
after
a
careful
inspection
of
the
premises
we
shall
have
to
keep
all
our
things
inside
our
bags
and
wash
in
an
enameled
tin
basin
and
drink
our
tea
out
of
mugs
it
will
be
precious
having
meals
under
that
tree
agreed
bessie
kirk
what
shall
we
do
if
it
rains
inquired
irene
mills
go
to
bed
with
hot
bottles
like
the
children
did
replied
nurse
robinson
they
always
thought
that
prime
fun
so
i
expect
you
will
too
you
soon
get
into
the
life
here
the
view
from
the
shelter
was
most
beautiful
in
the
far
away
distance
they
could
see
the
towers
of
seaton
minster
and
the
spires
of
the
churches
while
all
around
lay
lush
meadows
fields
of
growing
corn
and
woods
in
the
glory
of
june
foliage
the
camp
stood
in
the
corner
of
a
very
large
pasture
with
hedges
all
covered
with
lovely
wild
roses
and
tangles
of
honeysuckle
while
a
wood
close
by
showed
a
tempting
vista
of
pine
trees
the
fresh
country
air
and
the
smell
of
flowers
and
pines
were
delicious
life
at
the
camp
was
arranged
according
to
a
strict
every
one
rose
at
seven
and
a
certain
number
of
volunteers
helped
to
prepare
breakfast
then
came
crockery
washing
and
potato
peeling
at
which
duties
the
girls
took
turns
from
to
they
had
classes
with
miss
huntley
while
nurse
robinson
superintended
the
cooking
of
the
dinner
on
the
large
oil
stove
with
the
exception
of
an
preparation
the
rest
of
the
day
was
free
from
lessons
tea
was
at
four
and
supper
at
seven
and
by
nine
every
one
was
in
bed
well
covered
with
blankets
and
with
a
hot
bottle
if
she
liked
for
the
nights
were
apt
to
be
chilly
to
those
unaccustomed
to
sleeping
in
the
the
rules
of
quarantine
were
of
course
sternly
kept
no
girl
might
go
outside
the
pasture
without
special
permission
sometimes
miss
huntley
took
her
flock
for
a
walk
along
quiet
country
roads
and
rambling
but
the
vicinity
of
their
was
carefully
avoided
we
like
the
lepers
in
the
middle
ages
laughed
garnet
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
wear
a
coarse
white
cassock
and
ring
a
bell
as
i
go
about
to
warn
people
to
give
me
a
wide
berth
it
amusing
that
the
farmer
has
even
driven
his
cows
out
of
the
pasture
since
we
arrived
said
evelyn
he
let
them
feed
here
while
the
tuberculous
children
had
their
innings
and
i
should
have
thought
consumption
germs
were
as
bad
as
ones
they
were
real
consumptives
though
only
threatened
well
we
not
patients
either
only
contacts
i
sorry
for
those
poor
kids
sent
suddenly
back
to
their
slum
homes
after
being
here
for
weeks
said
jess
gardner
oh
the
kids
have
had
luck
there
were
only
ten
of
them
and
a
lady
at
hawberry
has
rigged
up
a
tent
in
her
garden
and
has
them
all
there
so
nurse
told
me
this
morning
they
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
gaining
pounds
and
pounds
in
weight
by
the
look
of
them
good
i
do
feel
so
bad
at
having
turned
them
out
then
it
great
here
rather
on
the
whole
i
feel
thoroughly
grateful
to
joyce
from
the
girls
point
of
view
there
really
was
matter
for
congratulation
none
of
them
was
ill
and
all
were
having
a
most
delightful
and
quite
unexpected
three
weeks
holiday
in
idyllic
surroundings
their
arms
to
be
sure
had
taken
and
were
more
or
less
sore
but
that
was
a
trifling
inconvenience
compared
with
the
pleasures
of
living
in
camp
there
was
no
anxiety
to
be
felt
about
joyce
she
had
the
disease
very
slightly
and
was
being
treated
with
such
extreme
care
that
her
face
would
not
be
marked
afterwards
it
was
ascertained
that
she
had
caught
the
infection
from
some
belgians
who
had
come
over
lately
from
holland
and
who
were
now
isolated
by
barnes
in
a
cottage
hospital
the
seaton
high
school
was
undergoing
elaborate
disinfection
and
as
june
was
well
advanced
the
governors
had
decided
not
to
until
september
when
all
possibility
of
contagion
would
have
passed
away
this
was
the
only
part
of
the
proceedings
that
did
not
please
the
girls
it
rather
sickening
to
have
no
end
to
the
term
groaned
marjorie
our
matches
are
all
off
and
no
swimming
display
or
sports
it
rough
on
margaret
and
kirsty
particularly
do
you
realize
that
when
we
go
back
in
september
they
both
have
left
all
the
prefects
are
leaving
oh
hard
luck
who
take
their
places
some
of
our
noble
selves
i
suppose
if
we
promoted
to
the
sixth
who
be
general
and
games
captain
ah
ask
me
a
harder
my
intelligent
child
i
think
i
could
put
my
finger
on
one
of
them
at
any
rate
so
could
i
perhaps
but
i
do
care
to
prophesy
too
soon
sighed
bessie
whoever
might
be
destined
to
wear
future
laurels
at
school
winona
as
captain
of
the
team
assumed
direction
of
the
games
at
the
camp
part
of
the
pasture
was
sufficiently
level
to
make
quite
a
fair
cricket
pitch
while
a
piece
in
the
opposite
corner
served
as
a
tennis
court
an
old
man
from
the
farm
was
bribed
to
come
and
cut
the
grass
with
a
scythe
but
as
no
or
roller
was
available
the
result
was
decidedly
rough
the
tennis
enthusiasts
rigged
up
a
tape
in
lieu
of
a
net
and
marked
some
courts
with
lime
begged
from
the
farmer
their
games
owing
to
the
general
bumpiness
of
the
ground
had
at
least
the
charm
of
variety
and
excitement
and
four
umpires
had
to
keep
careful
and
continual
watch
in
order
to
decide
whether
the
balls
went
over
or
under
the
tape
which
indeed
collapsed
occasionally
as
the
poles
were
only
sticks
cut
from
the
hedge
if
the
tennis
was
funny
the
cricket
was
even
funnier
many
of
the
girls
could
not
use
their
left
arms
at
all
consequently
the
batting
was
extraordinary
and
sometimes
the
easiest
catches
were
missed
it
was
very
amusing
however
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
provided
more
entertainment
than
the
most
strict
and
orthodox
play
under
the
critical
eye
of
kirsty
might
have
done
really
the
quarantine
party
had
a
most
idyllic
time
in
the
warm
june
weather
it
was
delightful
to
live
out
of
doors
there
were
dawns
and
sunsets
and
clear
starry
nights
when
the
planet
venus
shone
like
a
lamp
in
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
and
owls
would
fly
hooting
from
the
woods
and
bats
come
flitting
round
the
shelter
in
search
of
moths
one
day
indeed
was
wet
but
the
girls
sat
or
lay
on
their
beds
and
read
or
talked
and
played
games
with
intervals
of
exciting
dashes
in
mackintoshes
to
fetch
cans
of
water
or
dishes
from
the
larder
on
sundays
there
was
of
course
no
but
miss
huntley
read
morning
prayers
and
in
the
evening
they
sang
hymns
each
girl
in
turn
choosing
the
one
she
liked
best
all
things
bright
and
beautiful
nearer
my
god
to
thee
and
now
the
day
is
over
were
prime
favorites
but
perhaps
the
most
popular
of
all
was
the
ancient
hymn
of
patrick
which
miss
huntley
had
copied
from
a
book
of
erse
literature
and
had
adapted
to
an
old
irish
tune
the
girls
learnt
it
easily
and
its
fifth
century
celtic
mysticism
fascinated
them
they
liked
such
bits
as
in
light
of
sun
in
gleam
of
snow
myself
i
bind
in
speed
of
lightning
in
depth
of
sea
in
swiftness
of
wind
god
might
to
uphold
me
god
wisdom
to
guide
god
shield
to
protect
me
in
desert
and
wild
christ
with
me
before
me
behind
me
and
in
me
o
threeness
in
oneness
i
praise
and
adore
thee
in
ireland
it
is
sometimes
called
the
shamrock
hymn
said
miss
huntley
because
patrick
used
the
little
green
shamrock
leaf
to
explain
to
the
chiefs
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
the
original
is
in
a
very
ancient
dialect
of
the
irish
celtic
and
was
preserved
in
an
old
manuscript
book
written
on
parchment
it
always
reminds
me
of
the
omnia
opera
of
our
the
thought
is
the
same
in
both
ye
spirits
and
souls
of
the
righteous
bless
ye
the
lord
is
about
the
sum
of
it
all
except
for
the
trifling
trouble
of
vaccination
the
effects
of
which
in
most
cases
were
soon
over
the
quarantine
party
enjoyed
radiant
health
barnes
came
twice
a
week
to
inspect
and
nurse
robinson
kept
a
vigilant
watch
for
headaches
and
sickness
none
of
these
symptoms
appeared
however
and
all
began
to
congratulate
themselves
that
the
infection
had
been
avoided
there
was
a
burst
of
warm
weather
at
the
beginning
of
july
which
made
the
hill
breezes
of
dunheath
highly
acceptable
it
was
too
hot
during
the
daytime
to
play
active
games
the
girls
lounged
about
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
read
the
illustrated
papers
with
which
they
were
kept
plentifully
supplied
i
never
really
had
time
before
to
study
the
toilet
hints
said
beatrice
howell
one
afternoon
poring
over
a
certain
page
headed
my
lady
boudoir
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
take
our
complexions
more
seriously
we
actually
wash
our
faces
with
soap
and
water
and
veronica
says
here
that
that
an
absolutely
suicidal
practice
for
delicate
skins
she
gives
all
kinds
of
recipes
for
what
one
should
do
i
wish
i
could
have
a
few
lessons
in
face
massage
i
wonder
how
hard
one
ought
to
rub
and
why
a
downward
movement
all
the
time
beatrice
was
stroking
her
cheeks
contemplatively
as
she
spoke
why
may
you
rub
upwards
the
princess
recommends
gentle
pinching
said
mollie
hill
who
was
studying
the
columns
of
a
rival
paper
and
then
an
application
of
courtenay
lavender
cream
we
ought
to
be
careful
not
to
get
freckled
or
sunburnt
marjorie
gives
some
splendid
prescriptions
against
both
i
wonder
how
the
papers
always
get
the
aristocracy
to
write
their
beauty
hints
i
should
have
thought
they
have
condescended
to
reveal
their
secrets
my
good
girl
do
flatter
yourself
that
either
veronica
or
marjorie
is
a
member
of
the
aristocracy
chuckled
bessie
kirk
they
probably
most
plebeian
and
individuals
living
in
bloomsbury
with
pasty
complexions
and
freckled
noses
and
they
get
a
percentage
on
the
preparations
they
recommend
if
you
notice
they
always
tell
you
to
use
somebody
pomade
or
face
cream
and
it
generally
very
expensive
oh
but
this
one
declared
beatrice
look
here
it
says
an
ounce
of
spermaceti
and
melt
it
in
a
pan
with
a
teacupful
of
rose
water
when
thoroughly
mixed
add
an
ounce
of
vodax
which
may
be
obtained
from
any
chemist
stir
until
quite
cold
then
put
into
pots
i
sure
that
sounds
simple
enough
in
all
conscience
what
about
the
vodax
though
if
you
went
to
the
chemist
you
find
it
is
a
patent
preparation
and
very
expensive
and
it
would
just
knock
the
bottom
out
of
the
theory
of
the
recipe
there
must
be
something
in
all
these
hints
though
said
mollie
plaintively
or
the
paper
would
publish
them
every
week
well
perhaps
there
is
to
a
certain
extent
but
just
think
of
the
time
it
would
take
to
carry
them
out
to
say
nothing
of
the
expense
of
cosmetics
here
give
me
the
book
a
sec
and
a
piece
of
pencil
i
want
to
make
a
calculation
now
if
you
really
follow
advice
your
day
will
run
something
like
this
it
a
kind
of
beauty
face
massage
morning

evening

morning
evening
application
of
cloths
wrung
out
in
hot

physical
manicure
oatmeal
applications
total
hours
now
if
you
going
to
put
in
two
hours
every
day
at
your
toilet
it
seems
to
me
that
you
wo
have
much
time
left
for
games
unless
you
can
get
your
prep
excused
on
the
ground
that
you
studying
beauty
culture
i
like
to
see
bunty
face
if
you
asked
her
do
be
piggish
said
mollie
one
has
no
need
to
cultivate
a
tough
skin
just
because
one
fond
of
cricket
and
hockey
i
hate
to
see
girls
with
hard
red
cheeks
and
freckles
it
was
certainly
not
possible
to
obtain
courtenay
lavender
cream
or
any
other
toilet
specialties
at
the
camp
beatrice
and
mollie
however
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
preserving
their
complexions
commandeered
some
of
the
buttermilk
which
was
sent
daily
from
the
farm
and
dabbed
it
plentifully
over
their
faces
before
retiring
to
bed
following
the
application
with
massage
to
the
best
of
their
ability
they
were
emulated
in
these
toilet
rites
by
agatha
james
mary
payne
and
olave
parry
who
also
studied
the
beauty
hints
columns
and
liked
to
try
experiments
one
day
agatha
found
an
entirely
new
suggestion
in
a
copy
of
the
ladies
portfolio
a
correspondent
wrote
strongly
advocating
common
salt
as
a
hair
tonic
it
was
to
be
rubbed
in
at
night
and
brushed
out
again
in
the
morning
apparently
nothing
could
be
more
simple
beatrice
being
on
kitchen
duty
had
access
to
the
she
purloined
a
good
breakfastcupful
and
divided
the
spoils
with
her
four
confederates
they
all
rubbed
the
salt
carefully
into
the
roots
of
their
hair
next
morning
however
when
they
essayed
to
brush
it
out
again
it
obstinately
refused
to
budge
and
remained
hard
and
gritty
among
their
tresses
they
were
very
much
concerned
what
was
to
be
done
the
only
obvious
remedy
was
to
wash
their
hair
now
the
one
drawback
of
the
camp
was
its
shortage
of
water
the
daily
supply
had
to
be
carried
in
buckets
from
the
farm
and
as
owing
to
the
warm
dry
weather
the
well
was
getting
low
their
allowance
at
present
was
rather
small
and
had
to
be
carefully
husbanded
the
amount
doled
out
for
washing
purposes
certainly
was
quite
inadequate
for
the
due
rinsing
of
five
plentiful
heads
of
hair
i
suppose
we
shall
just
have
to
grin
and
bear
it
till
we
can
get
home
and
can
mermaid
properly
in
a
bath
sighed
mary
oh
i
ca
i
going
to
wash
mine
somehow
look
here
suppose
we
sneak
off
quietly
this
afternoon
and
go
on
a
water
hunt
there
is
a
stream
or
a
pond
anywhere
near
we
have
tried
the
wood
well
we
not
allowed
there
of
course
i
do
see
why
we
should
go
the
young
pheasants
must
be
all
hatched
and
running
about
by
this
time
so
what
harm
could
we
do
besides
which
nobody
troubling
about
preserving
game
during
the
war
they
shooting
germans
instead
of
birds
this
year
very
likely
the
gamekeeper
has
enlisted
suggested
beatrice
in
which
case
there
be
no
one
to
stop
us
now
the
strict
law
of
the
camp
confined
the
girls
to
the
pasture
but
as
it
was
the
last
week
of
the
quarantine
they
were
beginning
to
grow
a
little
slack
about
rules
the
five
victims
of
the
salt
cure
waited
until
miss
huntley
and
nurse
robinson
were
enjoying
their
afternoon
siesta
then
without
waiting
for
any
permission
they
climbed
the
fence
into
the
lane
found
a
thin
place
in
the
hedge
and
scrambled
into
the
wood
it
was
a
thrillingly
exciting
experience
rather
scratched
and
panting
they
surveyed
the
prospect
trees
were
everywhere
with
a
thick
undergrowth
of
bramble
and
bracken
apparently
there
was
no
path
at
all
i
suppose
we
shall
just
have
to
wander
about
till
we
see
a
pond
remarked
agatha
i
believe
some
people
can
find
water
with
a
forked
hazel
twig
said
olave
they
hold
it
loosely
in
their
hands
and
it
jerks
when
the
water
near
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
do
it
oh
are
occult
people
laughed
beatrice
the
sort
that
see
spooks
and
do
you
know
besides
they
find
underground
water
and
tell
where
wells
ought
to
be
dug
we
want
a
pond
which
any
one
can
see
with
the
naked
eye
without
being
endowed
with
psychic
powers
my
natural
reason
tells
me
to
go
down
hill
and
perhaps
we
strike
it
in
a
hollow
the
girls
rambled
on
thoroughly
enjoying
the
coolness
of
the
shade
and
the
beauty
of
the
wood
as
beatrice
had
prophesied
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
incline
they
came
across
quite
a
pool
with
reeds
and
iris
growing
on
its
banks
they
rejoiced
exceedingly
now
it
is
one
thing
to
wash
one
hair
in
a
bath
or
a
basin
but
quite
another
to
perform
that
operation
in
a
pond
with
shallow
muddy
edges
the
girls
took
off
their
shoes
and
stockings
tucked
up
their
skirts
and
waded
into
the
middle
where
they
made
gallant
efforts
at
dipping
and
rinsing
their
heads
and
contrived
to
get
uncommonly
wet
in
the
process
they
wrung
out
their
dripping
tresses
mopped
them
with
handkerchiefs
for
nobody
had
dared
to
take
a
towel
and
spread
them
out
over
their
shoulders
to
dry
there
was
an
open
glade
close
by
where
they
could
squat
in
the
sunshine
and
let
the
breeze
help
the
process
mary
had
had
the
forethought
to
put
a
comb
in
her
pocket
and
she
lent
it
round
in
turns
they
were
sitting
in
a
row
like
five
mermaids
extremely
complacent
and
satisfied
with
themselves
when
footsteps
suddenly
crashed
through
the
wood
and
a
man
approached
them
for
once
beatrice
calculations
were
wrong
the
gamekeeper
had
not
yet
enlisted
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
far
better
employed
in
the
trenches
somewhere
in
france
but
here
he
was
still
in
england
and
looking
extremely
surly
and
truculent
you
no
business
to
be
in
this
wood
he
began
ca
you
read
the
trespass
notices
there
plenty
of
them
about
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
in
here
disturbing
the
pheasants
we
are
doing
any
harm
protested
olave
that
neither
here
nor
there
you
no
business
here
and
you
know
it
are
you
from
that
camp
up
the
hill
yes
then
take
yourselves
off
at
once
spreading
we
none
of
us
had
returned
beatrice
indignantly
told
you
we
were
doing
any
harm
still
if
this
will
make
things
right
and
she
slipped
into
his
hand
the
gamekeeper
expression
changed
considerably
and
his
tone
instantly
became
more
respectful
well
young
ladies
i
have
to
do
my
duty
and
of
course
you
understand
the
pheasants
must
be
disturbed
anyhow
perhaps
you
wo
mind
going
back
to
the
camp
now
i
show
you
a
path
that
will
take
you
into
the
lane
he
led
the
way
and
the
girls
followed
in
subdued
silence
feeling
rather
crestfallen
mollie
was
yearning
to
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
be
doing
his
duty
by
his
country
instead
of
by
the
pheasants
if
at
that
moment
she
could
have
found
a
white
feather
i
believe
she
would
have
presented
it
to
him
the
path
ended
in
a
small
gate
which
he
unlocked
he
ushered
them
solemnly
into
the
lane
pointed
out
a
trespass
notice
that
was
nailed
conspicuously
on
to
a
tree
and
then
retired
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
wood
the
girls
decided
that
unless
actually
compelled
they
would
not
divulge
where
they
had
been
it
was
a
bit
of
hard
luck
to
be
caught
giggled
olave
did
you
feel
queer
when
he
came
up
i
thought
he
was
a
beast
and
did
deserve
propitiating
with
a
tip
declared
agatha
but
we
washed
our
hair
rejoiced
mary
plaiting
her
long

chapter

captain
winona
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
themselves
their
relations
and
barnes
the
girls
passed
safely
through
their
period
of
quarantine
and
were
certified
as
fit
once
more
to
take
their
places
among
the
rest
of
the
world
they
left
the
camp
almost
with
regret
they
had
been
such
a
jolly
merry
party
and
had
enjoyed
such
high
jinks
there
that
they
felt
their
departure
closed
a
pleasant
episode
they
were
going
straight
home
to
holidays
however
which
was
a
very
different
matter
from
returning
to
work
the
remainder
of
july
and
the
month
of
august
passed
very
swiftly
to
winona
she
missed
percy
who
was
in
training
with
his
regiment
but
since
the
advent
of
their
new
governess
letty
and
mamie
had
grown
more
sensible
and
proved
quite
pleasant
companions
letty
especially
seemed
suddenly
to
have
awakened
so
far
as
her
intellectual
capacities
were
concerned
she
had
begun
to
devour
scott
and
dickens
took
a
keen
interest
in
nature
study
and
tried
sometimes
with
rather
comical
effect
to
be
extremely
superior
and
she
far
cleverer
really
than
i
am
thought
winona
pity
she
not
at
the
seaton
high
she
be
the
star
of
her
form
directly
i
wish
she
could
get
a
scholarship
some
day
with
her
school
experience
in
coaching
juniors
winona
was
able
to
give
her
family
some
drilling
in
the
matter
of
cricket
though
she
did
not
find
that
younger
brothers
and
sisters
proved
such
docile
pupils
as
the
members
of
and
it
was
the
usual
case
of
a
prophet
is
not
without
honor
save
in
his
own
country
and
while
to
high
school
juniors
she
preserved
the
authority
and
dignity
of
a
senior
to
letty
mamie
ernie
godfrey
and
dorrie
she
was
only
winona
she
practiced
tennis
with
the
vicarage
girls
and
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
her
play
had
improved
last
summer
they
had
nearly
always
beaten
her
now
it
was
she
who
scored
the
victories
i
learnt
how
to
play
games
at
high
even
if
my
report
was
only
moderate
she
said
to
herself
to
make
up
for
the
long
holiday
caused
by
the
scare
school
was
to
commence
at
the
beginning
of
september
aunt
harriet
who
had
not
been
well
and
was
taking
a
rest
in
scotland
wrote
that
her
house
in
abbey
close
was
shut
up
for
the
present
but
that
she
was
making
other
arrangements
for
her
until
her
return
this
term
a
hostel
was
to
be
opened
in
connection
with
the
high
school
and
winona
was
to
be
a
boarder
there
for
a
few
weeks
she
was
uncertain
whether
she
liked
the
prospect
or
not
but
she
nevertheless
left
home
in
good
spirits
the
hostel
was
under
the
superintendence
of
miss
kelly
it
was
prettily
furnished
and
looked
bright
and
pleasant
the
girls
had
a
common
where
they
could
read
write
paint
or
play
games
and
the
bedrooms
were
divided
into
cubicles
so
far
there
were
only
ten
boarders
though
there
was
accommodation
for
eighteen
but
no
doubt
the
numbers
would
be
increased
when
the
venture
became
better
known
the
school
seemed
very
strange
without
the
familiar
figures
of
margaret
howell
kirsty
paterson
patricia
marshall
and
the
other
prefects
all
of
the
sixth
had
left
except
linda
fletcher
and
dorrie
pollock
and
the
members
of
were
now
promoted
to
the
top
form
linda
fletcher
was
head
of
the
school
the
new
prefects
being
hilda
langley
agatha
james
bessie
kirk
grace
olliver
evelyn
richards
and
garnet
emerson
linda
with
her
past
year
experience
made
an
extremely
suitable
head
she
understood
thoroughly
what
ought
to
be
done
and
at
once
called
a
mass
meeting
of
the
whole
school
in
the
gymnasium
everybody
clapped
as
linda
stood
up
on
the
platform
to
open
the
proceedings
she
had
been
a
favorite
as
a
prefect
so
she
was
welcomed
in
her
new
capacity
of
general
girls
she
began
i
felt
it
was
better
to
lose
no
time
in
calling
this
meeting
to
settle
the
affairs
of
the
coming
school
year
i
am
in
a
difficult
position
because
i
have
to
follow
such
an
extremely
able
and
efficient
i
afraid
i
ca
hope
to
rival
margaret
howell
cries
of
yes
yes
and
you
do
from
the
audience
but
at
least
i
shall
try
to
do
my
duty
during
the
past
year
we
may
fairly
consider
that
the
high
made
enormous
strides
owing
to
the
exertions
of
our
former
and
prefects
a
most
excellent
foundation
has
been
laid
the
dramatic
society
the
debating
club
the
literary
association
the
photographic
union
and
the
natural
history
league
all
accomplished
very
satisfactory
work
and
may
be
considered
in
a
most
flourishing
condition
perhaps
though
our
greatest
improvement
is
in
the
direction
of
games
this
may
not
appear
on
the
surface
for
though
we
won
five
hockey
matches
it
was
impossible
for
reasons
well
known
to
you
to
have
fixtures
for
hockey
and
tennis
we
feel
nevertheless
that
in
spite
of
our
inability
to
test
our
skill
against
that
of
other
schools
we
are
conscious
of
the
enormous
improvement
that
has
taken
place
in
our
play
it
was
kirsty
paterson
policy
to
train
recruits
for
the
games
so
that
every
girl
in
the
school
might
be
a
possible
champion
how
well
she
succeeded
i
hope
our
next
season
matches
may
testify
let
us
all
work
together
for
the
good
of
the
school
and
try
to
establish
the
reputation
of
the
high
i
need
not
remind
you
that
everything
in
the
coming
year
will
depend
upon
the
energy
and
efficiency
of
the
games
captain
as
soon
as
i
knew
that
i
was
i
wrote
to
kirsty
who
is
staying
in
cornwall
and
asked
for
her
opinion
upon
this
most
important
point
i
want
to
read
you
an
extract
from
her
reply
which
i
received
this
morning
she
says
ask
me
who
is
to
be
the
new
games
captain
well
of
course
it
is
a
delicate
matter
to
nominate
my
own
successor
but
from
my
knowledge
of
everybody
capacities
i
should
most
decidedly
suggest
winona
woodward
she
is
a
good
player
herself
and
has
a
particular
aptitude
for
organization
which
should
prove
invaluable
she
thoroughly
appreciates
the
advantage
of
having
reserves
to
fall
back
upon
and
is
most
keen
on
keeping
up
the
standard
i
do
hope
the
dear
old
high
will
have
a
splendid
year
i
shall
be
frantic
to
hear
how
you
get
on
send
me
a
with
the
result
of
the
meeting
well
continued
linda
you
heard
kirsty
opinion
it
coincides
entirely
with
mine
will
some
one
kindly
propose
that
winona
woodward
shall
be
elected
games
captain
i
have
much
pleasure
in
making
the
proposal
said
bessie
kirk
standing
up
promptly
and
i
have
much
pleasure
in
seconding
it
murmured
grace
olliver
will
all
who
are
in
favor
kindly
hold
up
their
hands
carried
unanimously
i
extremely
glad
as
i
sure
winona
is
right
man
for
the
job
and
worthy
to
carry
on
kirsty
traditions
i
vote
we
give
her
three
cheers
winona
flushed
crimson
as
the
rang
forth
she
had
never
expected
such
a
complete
she
had
known
that
her
name
was
to
be
submitted
for
the
captaincy
but
she
had
thought
that
bessie
kirk
and
marjorie
kemp
held
equal
chances
and
that
the
voting
would
probably
be
fairly
evenly
divided
that
kirsty
should
have
written
to
nominate
her
was
an
immense
gratification
kirsty
praise
at
the
time
had
been
scant
and
winona
had
no
idea
that
her
former
chief
held
her
in
such
esteem
to
winona
the
occasion
seemed
the
triumph
of
her
life
she
would
rather
be
games
captain
than
have
any
other
honor
that
could
possibly
be
offered
to
her
glorious
visions
of
successful
matches
of
shields
or
cups
won
and
a
county
reputation
for
the
school
swam
before
her
eyes
and
she
winona
woodward
was
to
have
the
privilege
of
leading
and
directing
all
this
it
was
indeed
a
thrilling
prospect
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
symposium
of
a
year
ago
when
as
a
new
and
unknown
girl
she
had
listened
to
margaret
howell
inspiring
speech
how
unlikely
it
had
seemed
then
that
she
would
ever
have
a
hand
in
making
school
history
but
how
her
spirit
had
been
stirred
and
how
she
had
longed
to
do
her
part
it
was
something
to
have
realized
her
pet
ambition
it
was
most
awfully
good
of
you
to
propose
me
she
said
to
bessie
kirk
afterwards
you
a
splendid
chance
yourself
not
i
returned
bessie
lightly
kirsty
letter
settled
the
whole
business
i
should
have
made
nearly
as
good
a
captain
as
you
i
care
to
bother
with
the
kids
and
i
hate
all
the
business
part
of
it
making
the
fixtures
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
you
be
and
we
all
play
up
no
end
i
believe
we
dare
venture
a
fixture
with
grant
park
this
season
winona
fully
realized
the
responsibilities
of
her
important
position
and
began
at
once
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
her
new
duties
she
took
possession
of
the
games
register
with
its
records
of
past
matches
and
began
to
make
plans
for
hockey
fixtures
the
term
had
begun
so
early
that
the
other
schools
in
the
county
had
not
yet
that
however
was
really
an
advantage
as
it
gave
her
more
time
for
consideration
at
present
the
september
weather
was
hot
as
summer
and
tennis
and
cricket
were
still
in
full
swing
in
order
to
spur
on
enthusiasm
winona
organized
a
school
tennis
tournament
the
result
was
highly
satisfactory
several
new
and
unsuspected
stars
swam
into
view
and
she
determined
to
keep
her
eye
upon
them
as
possible
champions
for
next
summer
you
never
know
what
a
girl
capable
of
till
you
try
her
she
confided
to
garnet
who
would
ever
have
thought
that
that
little
emily
cooper
could
beat
ethel
march
i
was
simply
astounded
i
my
plans
for
emily
i
can
tell
you
and
i
believe
bertha
march
is
going
to
be
a
second
annie
hardy
she
serves
in
exactly
the
same
way
oh
hopes
for
next
summer
brilliant
glorious
hopes
the
school
took
every
opportunity
of
using
the
fine
weather
while
it
lasted
the
photographic
union
organized
an
outing
to
linworth
a
picturesque
town
six
miles
away
where
an
old
castle
an
elizabethan
mansion
a
river
and
many
quaint
streets
made
subjects
for
their
cameras
and
promised
to
provide
materials
for
an
exhibition
later
on
when
films
were
developed
and
prints
taken
the
natural
history
league
had
another
delightful
ramble
under
miss

leadership
and
secured
additional
specimens
for
the
museum
on
this
occasion
winona
and
garnet
started
in
better
time
for
the
station
and
did
not
get
into
the
wrong
train
as
they
had
done
on
the
expedition
to
monkend
woods
dollikins
as
miss
lever
was
affectionately
nicknamed
was
as
great
a
favorite
as
ever
among
the
girls
owing
to
changes
on
the
staff
she
now
had
charge
of
and
taught
mathematics
throughout
the
junior
forms
so
that
the
seniors
saw
little
of
her
in
school
hours
on
a
ramble
she
was
as
jolly
as
one
of
themselves
the
sixth
had
a
new
mistress
miss
goodson
who
had
only
joined
the
staff
this
term
the
form
was
rather
uncertain
whether
to
like
her
or
not
it
was
rumored
that
she
had
been
engaged
specially
to
coach
them
for
the
matriculation
so
far
the
high
school
had
been
laying
foundations
and
had
not
sent
in
any
candidates
for
public
examinations
this
year
however
having
a
certain
amount
of
promising
material
in
the
sixth
miss
bishop
had
decided
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
trying
to
win
the
educational
laurels
towards
which
their
training
had
been
directed
miss
goodson
came
from
a
high
school
in
the
north
and
brought
with
her
a
reputation
for
successful
coaching
she
was
well
up
in
all
her
subjects
but
she
was
a
cold
and
not
very
inspiring
person
she
was
apt
to
concentrate
her
energies
on
the
clever
members
of
her
form
and
leave
the
less
brilliant
to
stumble
along
as
best
they
could
winona
who
certainly
belonged
to
the
second
category
did
not
like
miss
goodson
while
garnet
was
strongly
in
her
favor
in
her
new
capacity
of
prefect
garnet
proved
a
success
she
was
as
enthusiastic
over
the
bookish
side
of
the
school
as
winona
over
the
athletic
department
she
was
president
of
the
literary
association
a
member
of
the
debating
club
committee
and
head
librarian
the
school
library
had
grown
and
prospered
exceedingly
since
its
installation
by
margaret
howell
it
now
numbered
nearly
five
hundred
volumes
and
its
shelves
almost
filled
the
prefects
room
garnet
managed
it
systematically
she
had
special
hours
at
which
books
were
issued
and
assistants
whose
business
it
was
to
be
on
duty
at
the
specified
times
among
other
improvements
in
the
school
welcomed
by
the
girls
was
the
advent
of
a
fresh
drilling
mistress
and
some
new
apparatus
for
gymnastics
under
miss
barbour
gym
became
highly
popular
and
it
was
felt
that
an
athletic
display
would
probably
be
held
at
christmas
this
was
something
to
work
for
and
every
one
seemed
much
keener
than
formerly
winona
was
naturally
an
enthusiast
and
tried
to
keep
others
up
to
the
mark
she
had
once
seen
an
at
college
and
the
memory
of
it
made
her
long
for
the
seaton
high
school
to
have
a
similar
opportunity
of
showing
its
prowess
she
and
a
select
circle
of
friends
practiced
whenever
possible
altogether
among
the
various
athletic
activities
of
the
school
captain
winona
promised
herself
a
very
enjoyable
year
in
the
sixth
form
chapter
xiii
the
hostel
aunt
harriet
had
intended
to
return
home
towards
the
end
of
september
but
her
health
continued
so
unsatisfactory
that
her
doctor
ordered
her
to
harrogate
to
drink
the
waters
and
advised
a
long
period
of
rest
and
change
before
again
taking
up
the
many
occupations
with
which
she
busied
herself
in
seaton
miss
beach
was
a
restive
patient
and
sidwell
knew
that
if
he
once
allowed
her
to
be
within
reach
of
committees
she
would
plunge
herself
into
work
while
to
keep
away
from
the
scenes
of
her
former
activity
was
her
only
chance
of
recovery
the
house
in
abbey
close
was
still
shut
up
and
winona
for
the
present
term
was
established
at
the
hostel
on
the
whole
she
liked
it
she
missed
certain
things
particularly
her
own
bedroom
and
the
quiet
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
prepare
her
lessons
but
life
in
a
community
had
its
compensations
it
was
a
nuisance
to
have
to
sleep
in
the
same
dormitory
with
betty
carlisle
who
snored
offensively
but
on
the
other
hand
winona
cubicle
was
next
to
the
window
with
the
little
balcony
that
overlooked
the
park
and
every
morning
she
could
watch
an
aëroplane
hovering
and
flitting
like
a
beautiful
over
the
city
seaton
possessed
a
government
aircraft
factory
and
each
finished
machine
had
to
be
carefully
tested
all
the
girls
in
the
school
were
extremely
interested
in
the
exploits
of
lieutenant
mainwaring
a
member
of
the
flying
corps
who
might
constantly
be
seen
practicing
he
was
a
cousin
of
elsie
mainwaring
a
fifth
form
girl
elsie
recorded
his
doings
with
immense
pride
and
provided
information
of
his
whereabouts
he
was
a
very
daring
young
fellow
and
was
reported
to
have
looped
the
loop
winona
had
never
witnessed
the
performance
of
this
feat
so
she
looked
out
eagerly
each
day
hoping
she
might
have
the
luck
to
see
him
do
it
when
the
biplane
came
swooping
over
the
park
she
would
wave
her
handkerchief
to
it
from
the
balcony
by
way
of
encouragement
she
was
immensely
patriotic
and
she
considered
that
our
airmen
deserved
praise
almost
beyond
any
other
branch
of
our
forces
she
often
wished
percy
were
in
the
flying
squadron
she
cut
out
all
the
pictures
of
aëroplanes
from
the
seaton
and
pinned
them
up
in
her
cubicle
there
was
a
portrait
of
lieutenant
mainwaring
among
the
number
and
this
she
placed
on
her
side
by
side
with
percy
photograph
according
to
elsie
it
was
a
very
bad
likeness
but
as
winona
had
not
seen
the
original
except
at
a
distance
she
had
no
means
of
judging
curiosity
led
her
to
borrow
a
pair
of
from
garnet
she
was
standing
one
morning
on
the
balcony
when
the
aëroplane
came
in
sight
and
hovered
quite
low
down
over
the
park
exactly
opposite
the
hostel
windows
through
her
glasses
winona
could
plainly
see
the
occupant
the
impulse
to
smile
and
wave
was
irresistible
to
her
immense
surprise
the
signal
was
returned
in
frantic
excitement
she
waved
again
and
shouted
hooray
what
are
you
doing
winona
woodward
snapped
a
voice
behind
her
and
turning
guiltily
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
miss
kelly
i
i
was
only
looking
at
the
aëroplane
stammered
winona
come
in
at
once
you
know
perfectly
well
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
allowed
i
am
very
much
surprised
and
disgusted
if
i
find
you
signaling
to
gentlemen
again
from
this
balcony
i
shall
change
your
dormitory
whose
are
those
garnet
emerson
said
winona
sulkily
then
you
must
give
them
back
to
garnet
this
morning
remember
that
such
unladylike
conduct
must
never
happen
again
at
the
hostel
winona
considered
herself
very
much
aggrieved
she
had
waved
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
to
have
her
innocent
and
impulsive
act
construed
into
signaling
to
gentlemen
and
reproved
as
unladylike
conduct
was
highly
aggravating
miss
kelly
was
a
disciplinarian
and
of
a
very
suspicious
temperament
her
idea
of
duty
was
the
french
one
of
surveillance
she
never
trusted
the
girls
or
put
them
upon
their
honor
her
mode
of
procedure
was
to
keep
an
eye
upon
them
and
to
pop
in
suddenly
and
surprise
them
they
resented
this
attitude
extremely
miss
kelly
always
gives
us
credit
for
going
to
do
the
very
worst
grumbled
betty
carlisle
she
puts
ideas
into
our
heads
declared
doris
hooper
indignantly
the
gist
of
the
trouble
was
this
the
girls
at
the
hostel
expected
to
have
as
much
liberty
as
if
they
were
in
their
own
homes
while
miss
kelly
who
had
formerly
been
a
mistress
at
chad
wished
to
enforce
strict
rules
it
was
much
more
difficult
to
do
this
because
the
hostel
only
formed
part
of
a
large
day
school
the
general
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
more
free
than
at
a
college
where
all
alike
are
boarders
and
the
girls
naturally
were
infected
by
the
prevailing
spirit
a
constant
source
of
annoyance
was
the
rule
that
they
must
report
themselves
in
the
hostel
at
it
was
the
fashion
to
linger
after
school
and
chat
in
the
gym
or
in
the
playground
it
was
a
delightful
little
time
when
everybody
could
meet
every
one
else
and
discuss
school
news
and
matches
and
guilds
and
other
interesting
topics
to
be
obliged
for
no
particular
reason
to
cut
short
their
conversations
and
race
back
to
the
hostel
was
annoying
the
boarders
evaded
the
rule
as
far
as
possible
but
miss
kelly
kept
a
and
they
knew
that
their
absences
would
be
duly
reported
to
miss
bishop
to
winona
in
especial
many
of
the
rules
were
extremely
irksome
at
more
than
sixteen
and
a
half
she
felt
it
ridiculous
to
be
obliged
to
ask
permission
to
go
out
and
buy
a
lead
pencil
at
the
stationer
it
like
living
in
a
convent
she
fumed
another
bone
of
contention
was
her
preparation
she
had
been
so
accustomed
to
work
in
a
room
by
herself
at
abbey
close
that
she
found
the
presence
of
others
highly
distracting
though
silence
was
enforced
the
girls
fluttered
the
leaves
of
their
books
scratched
with
their
pens
or
even
murmured
dates
under
their
breath
all
of
which
sounds
were
most
irritating
winona
begged
to
be
allowed
to
take
her
books
to
her
cubicle
but
miss
kelly
would
not
hear
of
it
illustration
to
see
a
real
live
airman
at
such
close
quarters
was
not
an
ordinary
experience
i
can
not
make
an
exception
for
one
she
replied
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
allow
girls
to
work
as
they
liked
in
the
dormitories
there
would
be
more
talking
than
preparation
you
stay
here
with
the
others
and
i
can
see
for
myself
what
you
doing
the
hint
that
miss
kelly
suspected
her
of
some
ulterior
motive
for
wishing
to
study
upstairs
enraged
winona
but
she
was
obliged
to
submit
and
to
sit
close
under
the
mistress
eye
at
the
long
table
in
company
with
her
her
work
suffered
in
consequence
and
miss
goodson
sarcasms
descended
on
her
head
miss
goodson
was
not
so
patient
a
teacher
as
miss
huntley
and
winona
tried
her
temper
at
times
winona
was
subject
to
curious
fits
of
stupidity
her
brains
were
like
a
clock
with
a
broken
cog
sometimes
they
would
work
easily
and
on
other
days
she
seemed
quite
unable
to
grasp
the
most
obvious
problems
a
lively
imagination
may
be
a
very
delightful
possession
and
of
use
in
the
writing
of
history
and
literature
exercises
but
it
can
not
supply
the
place
of
solid
facts
nor
is
it
of
the
least
aid
in
mathematics
so
winona
form
record
was
not
high
the
hockey
season
would
commence
at
the
beginning
of
october
but
during
september
while
the
weather
was
still
warm
the
girls
continued
to
play
cricket
on
wednesdays
the
school
was
fortunate
enough
to
possess
large
playing
fields
these
adjoined
the
public
park
in
itself
a
big
area
so
that
quite
a
fine
open
space
lay
below
the
buildings
one
afternoon
just
as
winona
was
having
her
innings
elsie
mainwaring
uttered
a
cry
and
pointed
overhead
far
up
in
the
clouds
was
the
aëroplane
and
it
was
gracefully
looping
the
loop
it
harry
he
showing
off
for
our
benefit
squealed
elsie
excitedly
i
told
him
we
should
be
playing
cricket
oh
he
do
it
cleverly
he
went
just
straight
head
over
heels
in
the
air
let
wave
to
him
and
perhaps
he
come
down
a
little
handkerchiefs
fluttered
out
so
briskly
that
the
field
resembled
a
washing
day
miss
barbour
was
signaling
as
vigorously
as
the
rest
evidently
lieutenant
mainwaring
took
the
display
for
an
invitation
the
biplane
descended
like
a
hawk
and
to
every
one
immense
gratification
alighted
on
the
school
ground
to
see
a
real
live
airman
at
such
close
quarters
was
not
an
ordinary
experience
elsie
promptly
introduced
her
cousin
to
miss
barbour
and
begged
that
they
might
all
inspect
the
machine
lieutenant
mainwaring
explained
the
various
parts
perhaps
he
rather
enjoyed
a
visit
to
a
ladies
school
he
did
not
stay
long
however
but
after
a
few
minutes
started
his
engine
and
went
soaring
up
again
into
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
wheeling
over
the
towers
of
the
old
minster
was
soon
lost
to
sight
behind
some
clouds
it
must
be
glorious
to
fly
sighed
winona
in
spite
of
miss
kelly
injunctions
she
could
not
help
looking
out
of
her
window
every
morning
for
the
aëroplane
and
giving
a
surreptitious
wave
she
told
herself
that
she
was
only
acting
patriotically
in
cheering
on
our
aërial
defenses
the
back
of
the
hostel
opened
into
the
school
playground
and
one
day
winona
taking
a
run
there
for
exercise
before
breakfast
heard
the
familiar
whirring
and
looking
up
beheld
the
poised
just
overhead
she
heard
a
shout
from
the
occupant
and
something
dropped
into
the
playground
she
ran
to
pick
it
up
it
was
a
packet
of
chocolates
she
tried
to
wave
thanks
but
the
biplane
had
moved
on
and
was
now
far
over
the
town
lieutenant
mainwaring
no
doubt
having
enjoyed
his
little
joke
of
innocent
now
most
unfortunately
for
winona
miss
kelly
bedroom
window
overlooked
the
playground
and
she
had
been
a
witness
of
the
whole
incident
she
came
out
now
in
extreme
wrath
confiscated
the
chocolates
and
scolded
winona
sharply
but
it
not
my
fault
i
no
idea
he
was
going
to
drop
anything
protested
winona
indignantly
after
what
has
happened
before
i
can
only
draw
my
own
conclusions
returned
the
mistress
icily
you
will
change
to
number
dormitory
but
miss
kelly
do
argue
i
warned
you
that
i
should
move
you
if
i
found
any
more
signaling
going
on
your
aunt
will
have
to
hear
about
this
when
winona
returned
to
the
hostel
that
afternoon
and
went
upstairs
she
found
that
all
her
possessions
had
been
cleared
out
of
number
dormitory
and
placed
in
number
which
being
at
the
side
of
the
house
had
no
view
except
the
school
buildings
the
contents
of
her
drawers
had
been
transferred
intact
her
brushes
books
and
home
photos
were
placed
on
her
new
but
all
the
pictures
of
aëroplanes
and
the
portrait
of
lieutenant
mainwaring
which
she
had
cut
out
of
the
seaton
had
disappeared
winona
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
laughed
she
was
very
much
annoyed
but
the
humor
of
the
situation
appealed
to
her
it
too
idiotic
of
miss
kelly
does
she
think
i
going
to
elope
in
an
aëroplane
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
silly
in
my
life
she
may
tell
aunt
harriet
if
she
pleases
i
do
care
why
i
do
suppose
lieutenant
mainwaring
knows
me
from
any
other
girl
in
the
school
he
just
dropped
those
chocs
on
spec
it
was
a
shame
i
was
allowed
to
eat
them
miss
kelly
very
keen
on
upholding
discipline
in
her
new
hostel
considered
that
she
had
successfully
squashed
an
incipient
flirtation
and
kept
a
stern
eye
on
all
the
elder
girls
and
most
particularly
on
winona
for
fear
some
repetition
of
the
offense
might
occur
the
boarders
were
justly
indignant
too
bad
was
the
general
verdict
winona
not
a
scrap
that
sort
of
girl
really
if
miss
kelly
only
knew
it
absurd
to
make
such
a
fuss
out
of
sheer
bravado
and
love
of
mischief
the
remaining
occupants
of
number
dormitory
waved
not
only
handkerchiefs
but
towels
from
the
balcony
when
they
heard
the
whirring
of
the
aëroplane
overhead
enjoying
the
exciting
sensation
that
any
moment
they
might
be
pounced
upon
by
miss
kelly
no
doubt
in
time
they
would
have
been
discovered
in
the
act
but
at
the
end
of
three
days
lieutenant
mainwaring
was
sent
to
the
front
and
his
successor
not
having
a
cousin
at
the
seaton
high
school
took
no
interest
in
school
girls
and
flew
over
the
city
oblivious
of
everything
except
his
engines
i
do
suppose
he
notice
if
we
waved
a
sheet
said
betty
carlisle
disappointedly
the
police
might
though
and
they
think
you
were
signaling
to
germans
replied
doris
hooper
come
in
bet
it
no
use
girl
alive
quick
i
hear
the
dragon
fairy
footsteps
in
the
passage
do
you
want
to
get
your
head
bitten
off
in
spite
of
occasional
hostilities
with
miss
kelly
winona
managed
to
have
a
good
deal
of
fun
at
the
hostel
the
other
girls
were
jolly
and
in
the
evenings
when
preparation
was
finished
they
would
play
games
together
in
their
there
were
high
jinks
in
the
dormitories
and
small
excitements
over
little
happenings
which
however
trivial
they
might
be
provided
considerable
entertainment
to
the
participants
only
one
really
stormy
incident
occurred
during
winona
term
at
the
hostel
and
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
miss
kelly
one
saturday
morning
when
winona
betty
and
doris
were
in
the
town
shopping
they
happened
to
meet
clarice
nixon
who
stopped
to
chat
and
ask
for
school
news
i
feel
fearfully
out
of
things
now
i
left
said
clarice
it
be
a
stale
winter
without
hockey
why
do
you
join
a
club
suggested
winona
should
care
to
it
would
be
no
fun
to
play
with
a
team
i
do
know
the
seaton
ladies
club
is
the
only
decent
one
and
i
hear
they
so
cliquey
i
wish
we
could
get
up
an
old
girls
hockey
club
why
that
would
be
simply
glorious
what
a
splendiferous
idea
oh
do
let
us
try
then
we
could
have
a
past
present
match
oh
would
it
be
precious
have
you
settled
up
your
fixtures
very
nearly
then
we
ought
to
get
this
thing
in
hand
at
once
you
games
captain
so
you
ought
to
organize
it
write
round
to
all
the
old
girls
you
know
and
ask
them
to
come
to
a
meeting
on
monday
is
that
rather
soon
said
betty
not
a
bit
no
time
must
be
wasted
if
the
club
to
be
a
going
concern
for
this
season
do
let
the
grass
grow
under
your
feet
is
my
advice
winona
was
naturally
impulsive
the
idea
appealed
to
her
so
immensely
that
she
straightway
bought
a
packet
of
postcards
and
a
number
of
halfpenny
stamps
and
sent
out
her
invitations
as
she
was
bound
to
report
herself
in
the
hostel
at
she
decided
to
call
the
meeting
there
at
it
could
be
held
in
the
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
discuss
matters
before
five
tea
she
wrote
to
margaret
howell
kirsty
paterson
and
all
the
former
members
of
the
sixth
and
was
already
exulting
over
the
success
which
she
hoped
would
accrue
she
was
sure
every
one
in
the
school
would
like
the
notion
when
they
heard
about
it
on
monday
morning
when
she
walked
into
her
form
room
she
noticed
several
of
the
prefects
talking
together
they
looked
at
her
significantly
as
she
entered
and
evelyn
richards
made
a
movement
as
if
about
to
speak
grace
olliver
however
laid
her
hand
on
evelyn
arm
and
pointed
to
the
clock
as
if
deferring
the
matter
at
eleven
break
as
the
girls
filed
out
of
the
room
agatha
james
laid
a
paper
on
winona
desk
it
bore
the
words
kindly
report
yourself
at
once
in
the
prefects
room
rather
mystified
winona
obeyed
the
summons
she
found
the
prefects
assembled
in
their
den
looking
dignified
and
perturbed
winona
woodward
began
linda
fletcher
are
you
responsible
for
this
showing
one
of
the
invitations
which
had
been
written
on
saturday
beatrice
howell
brought
it
to
me
first
thing
this
morning
by
margaret
advice
margaret
could
understand
why
you
had
sent
it
to
her
i
explained
on
the
card
replied
winona
eagerly
it
was
to
try
to
get
up
an
old
girls
hockey
club
and
who
gave
you
authority
to
call
such
a
meeting
asked
linda
icily
why
i
thought
as
games
captain
began
winona
then
she
stopped
for
the
faces
of
the
prefects
expressed
a
righteous
wrath
that
staggered
her
it
was
a
most
unwarrantable
liberty
continued
the
head
girl
as
games
captain
you
are
responsible
for
the
school
play
and
for
the
fixtures
but
you
certainly
not
to
take
upon
yourself
a
matter
of
this
kind
why
you
not
even
a
prefect
and
no
prefect
would
have
dreamed
of
calling
such
a
meeting
on
her
own
account
without
consulting
her
colleagues
i
thought
there
was
time
to
ask
stammered
winona
overcome
with
confusion
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
suggestion
had
already
been
placed
before
the
prefects
and
it
was
proposed
to
form
an
old
girls
guild
which
would
include
several
branches
a
hockey
club
being
among
the
number
an
initial
committee
meeting
is
to
be
held
next
thursday
margaret
howell
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
this
and
could
not
understand
why
you
should
have
stepped
in
and
called
a
meeting
at
the
hostel
thus
forestalling
our
arrangements
it
the
most
abominable
cheek
i
ever
heard
of
burst
out
agatha
james
what
were
you
dreaming
of
demanded
grace
olliver
poor
winona
she
suddenly
saw
her
innocent
impulsive
act
in
the
light
in
which
it
must
appear
to
the
prefects
it
had
never
struck
her
that
she
was
exceeding
her
authority
and
that
she
ought
to
have
referred
the
matter
to
the
head
of
the
school
the
urgency
of
getting
the
club
started
so
as
to
enter
a
past
present
in
her
list
of
fixtures
had
been
her
uppermost
thought
she
had
indeed
made
a
most
terrible
blunder
the
feeling
against
her
was
evidently
one
of
general
censure
even
garnet
looked
grave
and
bessie
kirk
was
bridling
linda
manner
was
coldly
official
the
stateliness
of
her
speech
was
more
cutting
than
agatha
explosive
wrath
winona
collapsed
utterly
and
groveled
i
most
fearfully
sorry
she
apologized
indeed
i
never
have
done
it
if
i
thought
about
it
i
was
an
utter
idiot
i
really
do
know
what
possessed
me
i
just
sent
off
those
cards
in
a
hurry
what
shall
i
do
there
is
time
to
write
back
to
everybody
i
think
i
can
send
messages
to
most
of
the
girls
and
if
any
turn
up
at
the
hostel
this
afternoon
they
must
be
told
linda
tone
was
slightly
mollified
i
hardly
need
impress
upon
you
the
necessity
in
future
of
referring
everything
to
headquarters
no
school
can
be
run
on
the
basis
of
individual
enterprise
duly
chastened
winona
left
the
prefects
room
she
had
the
further
annoyance
in
the
afternoon
of
explaining
the
situation
to
several
comers
who
turned
up
in
answer
to
her
invitation
notwithstanding
this
preliminary
disturbance
the
old
girls
guild
was
started
with
members
on
the
roll
a
hockey
club
and
a
dramatic
society
were
formed
both
of
which
promised
to
have
a
flourishing
existence
and
winona
had
the
satisfaction
of
fixing
a
past
present
match
for
the
following
march
the
prefects
were
magnanimous
enough
to
bear
her
no
so
on
the
whole
she
came
out
of
a
very
unpleasant
dilemma
much
better
than
she
expected
chapter
xiv
the
hockey
season
when
the
hockey
season
commenced
winona
got
to
business
she
was
wildly
anxious
to
prove
an
effective
games
captain
and
win
credit
for
the
school
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
to
follow
so
excellent
a
predecessor
as
kirsty
paterson
but
she
determined
to
keep
kirsty
ideals
well
in
mind
and
try
to
live
up
to
them
one
change
which
kirsty
had
suggested
winona
at
once
carried
out
the
hockey
badge
was
altered
the
new
one
had
the
initials
embroidered
in
the
school
colors
on
plain
dark
blue
shields
and
looked
very
imposing
on
the
tunics
there
was
another
point
upon
which
winona
was
resolved
to
effect
a
reform
the
field
was
not
in
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
condition
and
certainly
needed
attention
the
prefects
had
put
the
matter
before
miss
bishop
who
referred
it
to
the
governors
those
august
personages
mindful
of
war
economies
decided
that
for
the
present
it
would
do
well
enough
and
would
not
vote
the
spending
of
any
money
upon
its
improvement
the
bad
news
was
received
with
indignation
throughout
the
school
it
too
stingy
for
anything
how
can
we
possibly
have
decent
practice
on
such
a
rough
old
place
i
like
to
make
them
come
and
try
it
for
themselves
the
mean
wretches
protested
bessie
kirk
winona
laughed
a
vision
of
the
governors
wildly
brandishing
hockey
sticks
flashed
across
her
imagination
she
seized
her
and
drew
a
fancy
portrait
of
the
delicious
scene
old
councillor
thomson
very
wheezy
and
fat
running
furiously
crabbe
performing
wonderful
acrobatic
feats
a
worthy
engaged
in
a
tussle
with
the
town
clerk
and
various
other
of
the
city
fathers
in
interesting
and
exciting
attitudes
the
masterpiece
was
passed
round
for
general
admiration
the
girls
sniggered
wish
we
could
show
it
to
them
said
margaret
kemp
perhaps
it
might
make
them
realize
their
responsibilities
it
too
sickening
of
them
to
grudge
keeping
the
field
in
order
look
here
it
no
use
complaining
said
winona
of
course
it
relieves
one
feelings
but
it
does
make
any
difference
to
the
field
i
got
a
plan
to
propose
let
us
ask
miss
bishop
how
much
it
would
cost
to
hire
somebody
to
do
the
rolling
and
offer
to
pay
for
it
ourselves
we
could
get
up
a
hockey
concert
in
aid
of
it
what
a
frolicsome
notion
i
your
man
would
it
be
setting
a
bad
precedent
objected
marjorie
kemp
suppose
the
governors
stop
having
the
tennis
courts
cut
and
say
we
may
do
it
ourselves
we
put
that
to
miss
bishop
first
and
make
it
well
understood
it
would
just
make
all
the
difference
to
the
practices
to
have
a
roller
at
work
even
once
a
week
urged
olave
parry
do
ask
about
it
win
miss
bishop
on
being
appealed
to
considered
the
suggestion
favorably
certainly
there
no
reason
why
you
should
improve
the
field
if
you
wish
she
replied
adding
with
a
smile
i
take
care
that
the
tennis
courts
do
suffer
in
consequence
it
was
a
prudent
thought
to
mention
them
i
expect
when
the
war
is
over
the
governors
may
be
persuaded
to
take
the
full
expense
of
the
playing
field
too
i
get
an
estimate
at
once
of
what
the
rolling
would
cost
jones
the
school
janitor
who
formerly
kept
the
courts
and
cricket
pitch
in
order
had
gone
to
the
war
and
his
place
was
occupied
by
a
rheumatic
old
fellow
who
could
do
little
more
than
carry
coke
and
attend
to
the
heating
apparatus
when
every
man
seemed
fighting
or
making
munitions
it
was
difficult
to
find
anybody
to
roll
a
hockey
field
a
volunteer
was
procured
at
last
however
who
undertook
the
job
at
the
rate
of
per
month
with
an
extra
thirty
shillings
for
putting
the
field
in
good
order
to
begin
with
six
or
seven
pounds
therefore
would
cover
the
expenses
of
the
season
winona
mindful
of
the
terrible
offense
she
had
given
in
connection
with
the
old
girls
guild
very
wisely
took
the
matter
to
linda
fletcher
who
called
a
united
meeting
of
prefects
and
games
committee
to
discuss
the
best
way
of
raising
the
money
it
will
have
to
be
done
on
a
bigger
scale
than
the
symposium
last
year
said
hilda
langley
if
i
remember
rightly
that
made
exactly
enough
for
a
form
trophy
but
not
sufficient
for
this
venture
we
better
issue
tickets
and
sell
some
of
them
to
parents
and
friends
suggested
linda
how
many
will
the
hall
hold
three
hundred
at
a
pinch
if
the
babes
squash
up
tight
they
wo
mind
doing
that
in
a
good
cause
the
dramatic
society
ought
to
take
an
innings
and
provide
at
least
half
the
program
they
jump
at
the
opportunity
i
believe
they
have
something
quite
prepared
and
have
been
yearning
for
an
audience
then
by
all
means
let
them
have
one
at
sixpence
a
head
added
practical
marjorie
we
ought
easily
to
be
able
to
sell
sixpenny
tickets
everybody
took
up
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
the
difficulty
was
not
so
much
to
find
helpers
as
to
decide
who
was
to
have
the
honor
of
performing
there
were
many
before
the
program
was
finally
fixed
it
was
decided
that
a
musical
selection
should
be
given
first
followed
by
a
piece
by
the
dramatic
students
to
cut
these
to
reasonable
limits
needed
all
linda
discretion
tact
and
firmness
you
ca
have
an
entertainment
beginning
at
three
and
going
on
till
midnight
she
urged
as
the
various
desired
items
were
submitted
to
her
you
have
to
hire
ambulances
to
take
your
exhausted
audience
home
very
sorry
but
we
must
keep
some
of
the
things
for
a
future
occasion
linda
being
wise
in
her
generation
and
having
an
eye
to
the
sale
of
tickets
insisted
that
the
lower
school
should
take
a
share
in
the
performance
who
wants
to
bother
to
hear
the
kids
objected
grace
olliver
who
by
the
bye
was
a
member
of
the
dramatic
and
therefore
not
entirely
disinterested
if
we
do
bother
with
the
kids
they
may
bother
to
come
and
bring
friends
and
we
should
look
silly
if
we
did
sell
all
our
tickets
let
them
do
their
flag
display
and
sing
their
empire
song
that
will
content
them
and
their
mothers
and
leaves
quite
time
enough
for
other
people
miss
bishop
allowed
a
special
wednesday
afternoon
to
be
set
aside
for
the
entertainment
the
tickets
sold
briskly
and
expectation
ran
high
all
concerned
in
the
program
kept
their
parts
a
dead
secret
but
items
leaked
out
and
the
wildest
rumors
were
afloat
it
was
whispered
that
some
of
the
governors
were
to
be
present
and
even
that
miss
bishop
would
perform
a
sword
dance
though
not
the
most
callow
of
juniors
really
consented
to
swallow
such
an
astounding
piece
of
information
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
was
in
store
however
added
largely
to
the
pleasurable
anticipation
and
though
the
dramatic
society
rehearsed
with
locked
door
and
the
keyhole
carefully
stopped
up
juvenile
spies
by
hoisting
one
another
up
to
the
level
of
the
windows
obtained
brief
and
tantalizing
peeps
and
spread
news
of
gorgeosities
in
the
way
of
costumes
when
the
great
afternoon
arrived
the
hall
was
crammed
the
little
girls
were
packed
as
tightly
as
sardines
a
long
line
of
them
squatted
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
first
row
and
others
sat
on
the
window
sills
the
latter
positions
having
been
scrambled
for
with
enthusiasm
every
one
was
at
the
of
expectation
the
concert
opened
with
the
inevitable
piano
solo
which
seems
indispensable
for
the
starting
of
any
entertainment
and
during
the
performance
of
which
latecomers
hurry
to
their
seats
programs
are
sold
and
the
audience
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
rustling
and
whispering
settles
itself
down
to
listen
this
initiatory
ceremony
being
over
more
interesting
items
followed
the
juveniles
sang
an
empire
song
accompanied
by
a
pretty
flag
drill
it
was
a
taking
tune
and
as
linda
had
prophesied
was
immensely
applauded
by
the
visitors
who
insisted
on
an
encore
a
violin
solo
came
next
and
was
followed
by
a
charming
russian
dance
given
by
two
members
of
form
garnet
played
a
piece
on
her
mandoline
with
piano
accompaniment
she
had
suggested
a
duet
for
mandoline
and
guitar
but
winona
had
had
no
time
to
practice
her
instrument
lately
and
had
begged
to
be
excused
the
fact
was
that
winona
had
been
busy
with
a
special
item
which
she
now
brought
out
as
a
surprise
to
the
school
she
had
composed
some
verses
in
praise
of
hockey
and
set
them
to
one
of
the
tunes
in
the
senior
school
the
piece
was
sung
by
an
eleven
in
full
hockey
costume
and
they
waved
their
with
appropriate
actions
to
the
music
when
autumn
returns
and
the
trees
are
all
bare
our
blue
tunics
are
off
to
the
field
no
team
in
excitement
with
ours
can
compare
as
our
wildly
we
wield
for
hockey
the
game
to
play
when
autumn
has
come
to
stay
and
this
is
the
reason
we
love
the
cold
season
for
hockey
the
game
to
play
hurrah
for
goalkeepers
for
forwards
and
halves
hurrah
for
the
clash
of
the
sticks
hurrah
for
the
rapture
of
scoring
a
goal
who
minds
a
few
bruises
or
kicks
for
hockey
the
game
to
play
when
autumn
has
come
to
stay
and
this
is
the
reason
we
love
the
cold
season
for
hockey
the
game
to
play
but
a
team
that
is
set
upon
scoring
its
goal
and
winning
a
or
two
must
see
that
its
field
it
should
carefully
roll
and
that
what
we
hoping
to
do
oh
hockey
the
game
to
play
when
autumn
has
come
to
stay
yes
this
is
the
reason
we
love
the
cold
season
when
hockey
the
game
we
play
hurrah
for
form
trophies
hurrah
for
our
badge
we
make
it
an
annual
rule
to
hold
a
concert
to
wish
all
success
to
the
team
of
the
seaton
high
school
oh
hockey
the
game
to
play
and
at
seaton
we
know
the
way
yes
this
is
the
reason
we
love
the
cold
season
when
hockey
the
game
we
play
winona
words
would
certainly
not
have
passed
muster
as
a
literary
composition
but
their
extreme
appropriateness
to
the
occasion
combined
with
the
action
of
the
completely
brought
down
the
house
the
applause
was
thunderous
and
the
last
verse
was
encored
twice
over
undoubtedly
it
was
the
hit
of
the
afternoon
for
the
second
part
of
the
performance
the
dramatic
society
gave
an
amusing
little
play
and
the
concert
wound
up
with
a
lusty
rendering
of
certain
patriotic
songs
winona
was
highly
gratified
both
artistically
and
financially
the
entertainment
had
proved
a
success
the
committee
would
be
well
able
to
bear
the
expense
of
keeping
the
field
in
order
a
gardener
had
been
at
work
there
and
already
a
marked
improvement
was
noticeable
the
games
captain
enthusiasm
was
infectious
under
her
leadership
the
girls
became
wonderfully
keen
to
winona
the
thrill
of
struggle
when
a
game
seemed
on
the
eve
of
being
lost
was
one
of
the
wildest
excitements
in
life
and
the
joy
when
she
struck
the
ball
home
straight
and
true
the
utmost
triumph
obtainable
during
this
autumn
term
she
lived
for
hockey
the
crowd
of
school
girls
in
thick
boots
and
blue
tunics
struggling
and
shouting
in
a
somewhat
muddy
field
might
not
be
an
altogether
picturesque
sight
but
to
the
captain
it
was
marathon
and
waterloo
combined
no
colonel
prided
himself
on
a
crack
regiment
more
than
winona
on
her
team
sometimes
of
course
a
practice
was
off
color
the
day
might
be
bleak
or
drizzly
or
players
might
be
penalized
for
sticks
or
grumblers
might
express
their
dissatisfaction
audibly
but
whatever
went
wrong
winona
emerged
cheerful
from
the
fray
remonstrated
with
and
sticks
and
reminded
growlers
that
it
is
unsporting
to
murmur
by
kirsty
advice
she
had
sent
out
challenges
to
several
good
clubs
in
the
neighborhood
while
we
were
still
in
our
callow
infancy
i
should
not
have
ventured
wrote
kirsty
from
cornwall
but
one
must
begin
some
time
to
measure
one
strength
after
the
work
we
did
last
season
i
certainly
think
you
might
risk
it
nothing
improves
a
team
so
much
as
playing
plenty
of
matches
you
see
in
time
you
get
to
know
the
strokes
of
everybody
at
the
high
and
you
can
calculate
what
others
will
do
at
certain
turns
of
the
game
it
far
better
for
you
to
meet
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
opponents
winona
had
been
afraid
it
was
rather
cheek
to
challenge
the
west
rytonshire
club
or
oatlands
college
but
she
ascertained
that
both
those
august
bodies
had
two
teams
number
and
number
and
that
while
the
first
only
met
foes
worthy
of
their
steel
or
rather
sticks
the
second
would
graciously
condescend
to
play
a
yet
unknown
high
school
the
match
with
oatlands
college
was
fixed
for
december
and
winona
looked
forward
to
it
with
some
anxiety
the
last
practice
had
not
been
altogether
satisfactory
the
day
had
been
wretchedly
cold
and
everybody
had
been
cross
in
consequence
the
team
though
proud
of
its
fixture
with
so
celebrated
an
opponent
was
not
very
sure
of
itself
i
hope
to
goodness
peggie
play
up
groaned
marjorie
kemp
the
way
she
lost
that
last
goal
on
saturday
was
idiotic
she
said
she
was
cold
commented
gladys
porter
witheringly
she
wanted
to
change
at
she
said
her
feet
were
solid
ice
and
her
nose
was
blue
and
it
was
no
fun
watching
the
whole
of
the
game
being
played
right
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
field
most
unsporting
moralized
marjorie
besides
when
she
got
her
chance
she
hit
the
air
it
will
be
very
humiliating
if
the
oatlands
team
walk
over
us
oh
do
be
a
jeremiah
we
not
beaten
yet
if
anybody
can
pull
us
through
our
captain
will
winona
a
jewel
agreed
marjorie
and
yet
the
best
captain
in
the
world
ca
make
up
for
an
only
moderately
good
team
i
feel
my
own
deficiencies
practically
the
whole
of
the
high
school
assembled
as
spectators
on
the
great
day
of
the
match
things
were
very
different
now
from
the
old
times
when
a
mere
handful
collected
to
cheer
the
seaton
team
mistresses
and
girls
were
alike
keen
and
most
desirous
of
witnessing
the
combat
they
followed
the
game
breathlesly
oatlands
is
worth
a
toss
commented
garnet
exultantly
do
make
too
sure
replied
linda
looking
with
apprehension
as
the
red
jerseys
of
their
rivals
massed
round
the
ball
a
familiar
figure
dashed
forward
a
hockey
stick
struck
and
the
ball
swept
out
to
safety
linda
heaved
a
long
sigh
of
relief
winona
is
just
she
murmured
hello
good
gracious
what
that
idiot
doing
for
ellinor
cooper
whose
arm
was
the
strongest
in
the
school
wielding
her
hockey
stick
with
all
her
force
had
hit
winona
across
the
shin
instantly
there
was
a
commotion
winona
white
with
the
agony
of
the
blow
leaned
hard
against
bessie
kirk
and
clenched
her
fists
to
avoid
crying
out
are
you
hurt
what
happened
you
had
a
nasty
knock
there
was
quite
a
crowd
round
winona
and
a
chorus
of
sympathy
put
in
a
substitute
urged
bessie
you
not
fit
to
go
on
no
no
i
better
now
panted
their
captain
with
a
wan
little
smile
i
manage
thanks
yes
really
please
do
worry
yourselves
about
me
the
game
recommenced
and
winona
with
a
supreme
effort
continued
to
play
the
pain
was
still
acute
but
she
realized
that
on
her
presence
or
absence
depended
victory
or
defeat
without
her
the
courage
of
the
team
would
collapse
how
she
lived
through
the
time
she
never
knew
inspired
by
the
heroic
example
of
their
captain
the
girls
were
playing
for
all
they
were
worth
the
score
which
had
been
against
them
was
now
even
time
was
almost
up
winona
set
her
teeth
the
ball
seemed
a
kind
of
star
which
she
was
following
following
anyhow
as
the
french
say
she
did
her
possible
the
ball
went
spinning
next
minute
she
was
leaning
against
a
trembling
with
the
violence
of
her
effort
while
the
high
school
hoorayed
itself
hoarse
in
the
joy
of
the
victory
i
say
old
girl
were
you
really
hurt
asked
bessie
anxiously
looking
the
color
of
chalk
never
mind
it
over
now
yes
i
am
hurt
give
me
your
arm
and
go
back
to
the
hostel
you
an
absolute
joan
of
arc
purred
bessie
winona
with
a
barked
shin
and
bad
bruises
limped
for
more
than
a
week
but
she
was
the
heroine
of
the
school
i
ca
think
how
you
ran
after
that
awful
whack
ellinor
cooper
gave
you
sympathized
marjorie
it
was
easier
to
run
then
than
after
my
leg
grew
stiff
laughed
winona
i
suppose
it
the
excitement
that
keeps
one
up
do
make
such
a
fuss
we
all
had
hard
knocks
in
our
time
agnes
smith
got
a
black
eye
last
spring
as
the
result
of
her
wounds
in
the
hockey
field
winona
made
friends
with
miss
kelly
the
latter
was
most
prompt
in
applying
lanoline
and
bandages
and
proved
so
kind
in
bringing
winona
her
breakfast
in
bed
and
making
her
rest
on
the
sofa
during
preparation
that
a
funny
little
sort
of
intimacy
sprang
up
between
them
she
fussy
on
the
surface
but
nice
when
you
know
her
confided
winona
to
garnet
if
i
been
staying
at
the
hostel
i
expect
we
should
have
got
on
capitally
next
term
chapter
xv
winona
turns
chauffeur
after
the
christmas
holidays
winona
returned
to
abbey
close
miss
beach
was
installed
once
more
in
her
own
home
though
under
strict
orders
from
the
doctor
not
to
herself
during
her
stay
at
harrogate
she
had
bought
a
small
car
and
had
learnt
to
drive
it
she
kept
it
at
a
garage
in
the
town
and
used
it
almost
every
day
it
was
invaluable
to
her
as
a
means
of
getting
about
she
was
anxious
not
to
relinquish
all
her
work
in
seaton
but
she
could
not
now
bear
the
fatigue
of
walking
in
her
car
distance
was
no
obstacle
and
she
could
continue
her
inspection
of
workhouse
children
attend
babies
clinics
in
country
villages
beyond
the
city
area
visit
the
wives
of
soldiers
and
sailors
regulate
the
orphanage
and
superintend
the
tipperary
club
miss
beach
energetic
temperament
made
her
miserable
unless
fully
occupied
so
the
doctor
having
forbidden
her
former
strenuous
round
of
duties
she
adopted
the
car
as
a
compromise
assuring
him
that
she
would
limit
her
list
to
a
few
of
her
pet
schemes
only
it
was
probably
her
wisest
course
it
is
very
hard
for
elderly
people
to
be
laid
on
the
shelf
and
to
feel
that
their
services
are
set
aside
miss
beach
had
lived
so
entirely
in
her
various
philanthropic
occupations
that
to
give
everything
up
would
have
been
a
severe
mental
shock
as
it
was
she
managed
to
obey
medical
orders
and
at
the
same
time
to
a
certain
extent
keep
her
old
place
in
the
work
of
the
city
as
the
days
became
longer
and
lighter
she
sometimes
took
her
with
her
in
the
car
winona
had
really
very
little
time
out
of
school
hours
her
duties
as
games
captain
were
paramount
and
hockey
practices
and
matches
absorbed
most
of
her
holiday
afternoons
when
she
had
an
occasional
free
hour
however
it
was
an
immense
treat
to
go
motoring
she
loved
the
feeling
of
spinning
along
through
the
country
lanes
it
was
delightful
to
see
new
places
and
fresh
roads
seaton
was
in
the
midst
of
a
beautiful
district
and
there
were
charming
villages
woods
and
lovely
views
of
scenery
within
easy
distance
one
saturday
when
for
a
wonder
there
was
no
event
at
school
miss
beach
suddenly
suggested
that
they
should
start
in
the
car
take
a
luncheon
basket
with
them
and
explore
some
of
the
country
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
a
glorious
spring
morning
with
a
clear
pale
blue
sky
and
a
touch
of
warmth
in
the
sunshine
that
set
winter
to
flight
and
brought
the
buds
out
on
the
trees
on
such
a
day
the
human
sap
too
seems
to
rise
there
is
an
exhilaration
physical
and
spiritual
when
we
long
to
run
or
to
sing
for
the
sheer
vital
joy
of
living
when
our
troubles
do
seem
to
matter
and
the
future
looks
rosy
and
for
the
moment
we
feel
transferred
to
the
golden
age
of
the
poets
when
the
world
was
young
and
pan
played
his
pipes
in
the
meadows
among
the
asphodels
winona
at
any
rate
was
in
an
ecstatic
frame
of
mind
and
though
aunt
harriet
did
not
openly
express
her
enthusiasm
the
mere
fact
of
her
suggesting
such
an
outing
proved
that
the
spring
had
called
her
and
that
she
was
ready
to
go
out
and
worship
at
nature
shrine
do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
miss
beach
whatever
her
feelings
allowed
any
romantic
element
to
appear
on
the
surface
she
fussed
over
the
car
measured
the
amount
of
petrol
left
in
the
tank
debated
whether
she
had
better
go
to
the
garage
for
an
extra
can
in
case
of
emergencies
called
out
the
cook
to
dust
the
seat
sent
the
housemaid
flying
to
the
attic
for
an
inspected
the
lunch
basket
gave
directions
for
things
to
be
done
in
her
absence
wrote
last
messages
on
a
slate
for
people
who
might
possibly
call
on
business
scolded
winona
for
putting
on
her
thin
coat
and
sent
her
to
fetch
her
thick
one
and
a
rug
for
her
knees
and
finally
after
a
very
breathless
ten
minutes
got
under
way
and
started
forth
they
drove
slowly
through
the
town
traffic
but
soon
they
had
left
streets
behind
and
were
spinning
along
the
high
road
in
the
direction
of
wickborough
long
as
she
had
lived
at
seaton
miss
beach
had
never
seen
wickborough
castle
and
she
was
determined
to
pay
it
a
visit
it
was
a
very
ancient
place
built
originally
by
king
canute
in
the
days
when
red
war
was
waged
between
saxon
and
norseman
little
of
the
old
danish
tower
remained
but
successive
generations
had
erected
keep
and
turret
bastion
and
guard
house
crumbling
now
indeed
into
ruins
but
picturesque
in
their
decay
and
full
of
historical
associations
here
proud
queen
margaret
hard
pressed
by
her
enemies
had
found
a
timely
shelter
for
herself
and
her
little
son
till
an
escort
could
convey
her
to
a
spot
of
greater
safety
here
richard
ii
had
pursued
sweet
unwilling
anne
of
warwick
and
forced
her
to
accept
his
hated
suit
princess
mary
had
passed
a
part
of
her
unhappy
childhood
within
its
walls
and
anne
boleyn
merry
laugh
had
rung
out
there
the
situation
of
the
castle
was
magnificent
it
stood
on
the
summit
of
a
wooded
cliff
which
ran
sheer
into
the
river
and
commanded
a
splendid
prospect
of
the
country
round
and
a
view
of
the
little
town
that
clustered
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
it
like
an
eagle
nest
commented
winona
as
leaving
the
car
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
they
climbed
on
foot
up
the
zigzag
pathway
to
the
keep
it
must
have
been
a
regular
stronghold
in
the
middle
ages
miss
beach
had
bought
a
and
rejecting
the
services
of
a
persistent
little
girl
who
was
anxious
to
point
out
the
various
spots
of
interest
with
an
eye
to
a
tip
they
strolled
about
trying
to
reconstruct
a
fancy
portrait
of
the
place
for
themselves
canute
tower
was
still
left
a
squat
solid
piece
of
masonry
with
enormously
thick
walls
and
tiny
lancet
windows
it
was
rather
dark
but
as
it
was
the
only
portion
remaining
intact
it
was
used
as
a
museum
and
various
curiosities
were
preserved
there
the
great
held
a
spit
for
roasting
an
ox
whole
and
had
a
poker
five
feet
long
stone
were
piled
up
on
the
floor
and
on
the
walls
hung
a
medieval
armory
of
helmets
gorgelets
coats
of
mail
shields
and
swords
daggers
and
lances
a
special
feature
of
the
museum
was
a
figure
of
a
knight
clad
in
full
armor
which
gave
an
excellent
idea
of
what
sir
bevis
of
wickborough
must
have
looked
like
somewhere
about
the
year
another
figure
dressed
in
rich
velvet
and
fur
with
flowered
silk
kirtle
represented
his
wife
dame
philippa
in
the
act
of
offering
him
a
silver
goblet
of
wine
while
a
hound
stood
with
its
head
pressed
to
her
hand
the
group
was
so
natural
that
it
was
almost
startling
and
took
the
spectator
back
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
to
the
ancient
medieval
days
which
it
pictured
a
small
stair
in
the
corner
of
the
tower
led
down
to
a
dungeon
where
lying
among
the
straw
was
an
equally
impressive
figure
of
a
prisoner
wretched
unkempt
and
bound
hand
and
foot
with
chains
a
pitcher
of
water
lay
by
his
side
and
a
stuffed
rat
peering
from
the
straw
added
a
further
touch
of
realism
winona
shuddered
it
was
a
ghastly
sight
and
she
was
thankful
to
run
up
the
stairs
and
go
from
the
keep
out
into
the
spring
sunshine
she
had
always
had
a
romantic
admiration
for
the
middle
ages
but
this
aspect
of
life
did
not
commend
itself
to
her
they
were
bad
old
times
after
all
she
decided
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
twentieth
century
even
with
its
horrible
war
was
a
more
humane
period
to
live
in
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
close
by
the
river
lay
the
remains
of
the
old
priory
church
an
fabric
whose
broken
chancel
still
gave
a
shelter
to
the
battered
tombs
of
the
knights
who
had
lived
in
the
castle
above
sir
bevis
and
dame
philippa
lay
here
in
marble
their
features
calm
and
rigid
their
hands
folded
in
prayer
less
human
indeed
but
infinitely
grander
than
in
their
wax
effigies
of
the
tower
seven
centuries
of
sunshine
and
storm
had
passed
over
their
heads
and
castle
and
church
were
alike
in
ruins
their
bones
are
dust
their
good
swords
rust
their
souls
are
with
the
saints
we
trust
thought
winona
as
she
took
a
photograph
of
the
quiet
scene
it
was
deeply
interesting
but
on
this
glorious
lovely
spring
day
it
seemed
a
little
too
sad
with
all
the
birds
singing
and
the
hedges
in
bud
and
the
daisies
showing
white
stars
among
the
grass
she
wanted
to
live
in
the
present
and
not
in
the
past
and
yet
if
we
think
about
it
rightly
the
past
is
never
really
sad
those
who
lived
before
us
accomplished
their
work
and
have
passed
onwards
a
part
of
the
world
scheme
to
we
doubt
not
fuller
and
worthier
work
beyond
we
still
in
the
preparatory
class
of
god
great
school
can
not
yet
grasp
the
higher
forms
but
those
who
have
been
moved
up
surely
smile
at
our
want
of
comprehension
and
look
back
on
this
earth
as
the
college
undergraduate
remembers
his
kindergarten
for
the
spiritual
evolution
goes
ever
on
working
always
godwards
and
when
the
human
dross
falls
away
the
imperfect
and
the
partial
will
be
merged
into
the
perfect
and
the
eternal
the
broken
eggshells
may
lie
in
the
old
nest
but
the
fledged
larks
are
singing
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
from
the
little
town
of
wickborough
they
drove
along
the
old
roman
road
towards
danestone
part
of
their
way
lay
across
wickland
heath
and
here
as
it
was
now
past
miss
beach
suggested
that
they
should
stop
and
take
their
lunch
it
was
a
most
glorious
spot
for
a
picnic
they
were
at
the
top
of
a
tableland
and
before
them
spread
the
common
a
brown
sea
of
last
year
heather
and
bilberry
with
gorse
bushes
flaming
here
and
there
like
golden
fires
a
more
majestic
than
any
aëroplane
sailed
serenely
overhead
and
a
pair
of
whinchats
perturbed
by
his
vicinity
flew
with
a
sharp
twitter
over
the
low
stone
wall
and
sought
cover
among
the
brambles
beyond
stretched
the
roman
road
broad
and
straight
a
landmark
for
miles
cities
and
civilization
were
far
away
and
they
were
alone
with
the
moor
and
the
peaty
little
brook
and
the
birds
and
the
sun
and
the
fresh
spring
wind
the
joyous
influence
was
irresistible
even
miss
beach
dropped
ten
years
burden
of
cares
and
waxed
almost
winona
had
seldom
seen
her
aunt
in
such
a
mood
and
she
seized
the
opportunity
as
a
favorable
moment
to
proffer
a
request
which
she
had
often
longed
but
had
never
hitherto
dared
to
make
it
was
no
less
a
suggestion
than
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
try
to
drive
the
car
she
put
it
in
tentative
fashion
fully
expecting
a
refusal
but
aunt
harriet
received
the
idea
quite
graciously
there
no
reason
why
you
should
the
road
wide
and
straight
and
not
a
vehicle
in
sight
you
could
have
a
better
place
to
learn
on
in
the
whole
of
the
kingdom
mind
you
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
all
winona
face
was
shining
ever
since
she
had
first
seen
the
pretty
little
it
had
been
her
secret
ambition
to
work
its
steering
wheel
for
herself
she
packed
up
the
lunch
basket
in
a
hurry
for
fear
her
aunt
might
repent
but
miss
beach
seldom
went
back
on
her
word
and
was
quite
disposed
and
ready
to
act
motor
instructress
she
began
by
explaining
very
carefully
the
various
levers
and
how
to
start
one
golden
rule
she
urged
is
to
take
care
the
lever
is
at
neutral
before
you
begin
or
the
car
will
jump
on
you
many
motorists
have
had
nasty
accidents
by
omitting
that
most
necessary
precaution
next
you
must
see
that
the
ignition
is
pushed
back
or
you
get
a
in
starting
and
break
your
wrist
it
must
be
just
at
this
notch
do
you
see
now
you
may
swing
round
the
handle
the
engine
began
to
work
and
winona
took
her
place
in
the
seat
miss
beach
sitting
by
her
side
showed
her
how
to
put
the
low
gear
in
then
to
put
in
the
clutch
the
car
started
off
under
guidance
she
gripped
the
steering
wheel
tightly
turning
it
to
right
or
left
at
first
according
to
her
aunt
directions
but
soon
from
instinctive
comprehension
it
was
something
like
guiding
a
gigantic
bicycle
she
could
not
yet
exactly
estimate
the
amount
of
turn
required
but
she
felt
that
it
would
come
to
her
with
practice
there
was
an
immense
exhilaration
in
feeling
the
car
under
her
control
for
a
beginner
she
really
kept
very
steadily
in
the
middle
of
the
road
occasionally
aunt
harriet
made
a
snatch
at
the
wheel
but
that
was
seldom
necessary
they
were
going
very
slowly
only
about
ten
miles
an
hour
but
even
that
seemed
a
tolerable
speed
to
a
novice
the
road
was
curving
now
and
winona
must
steer
round
a
corner
it
was
easier
than
she
had
expected
and
her
instructress
ejaculated
good
the
sense
of
balance
was
beginning
to
come
to
her
such
a
tiny
movement
of
the
wheel
sent
the
car
to
right
or
left
at
first
she
had
jerked
it
clumsily
now
she
could
reckon
the
proportion
with
greater
nicety
was
that
something
coming
in
the
distance
sound
your
hooter
shouted
aunt
harriet
quickly
as
a
motor
cycle
hove
in
sight
in
rather
a
panic
winona
squeezed
the
bulb
making
the
car
lurch
as
she
took
her
hand
momentarily
from
the
wheel
keep
well
to
the
left
commanded
miss
beach
and
winona
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
contrived
to
obey
and
passed
her
first
vehicle
successfully
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
it
had
whizzed
by
and
the
road
was
once
more
clear
naturally
however
she
could
not
expect
to
keep
a
thoroughfare
all
to
herself
further
on
she
overtook
a
farmer
cart
full
of
little
squealing
pigs
as
it
occupied
the
exact
center
of
the
road
she
hooted
with
great
confidence
this
time
and
when
it
had
swung
to
the
left
she
rounded
it
successfully
on
the
right
a
furniture
van
looked
a
terrible
obstacle
but
she
passed
it
without
assistance
and
began
to
wax
quite
courageous
three
motor
cars
in
succession
tearing
along
one
after
another
and
sounding
electric
hooters
left
her
nerves
rather
rocky
when
houses
and
chimneys
appeared
in
sight
miss
beach
told
her
to
stop
i
dare
let
a
learner
drive
through
a
village
there
are
always
too
many
children
and
dogs
about
the
street
change
places
with
me
now
and
you
shall
try
again
when
we
come
to
a
quiet
road
rather
thankful
not
to
have
to
venture
her
skill
in
the
narrow
winding
street
winona
gave
the
wheel
into
her
aunt
more
experienced
hands
it
was
only
however
for
when
they
were
once
more
in
the
open
country
miss
beach
continued
the
lesson
making
her
start
and
stop
several
times
just
for
practice
i
believe
you
know
the
routine
now
she
said
it
the
first
catechism
remember
those
cardinal
rules
and
you
ca
go
so
far
wrong
do
experienced
people
ever
forget
them
asked
winona
sometimes
when
they
grow
careless
forster
sprained
his
wrist
the
other
day
with
a
which
he
ought
to
have
avoided
and
i
heard
of
a
horrible
accident
in
paris
when
a
chauffeur
started
his
car
with
the
clutch
in
gear
with
the
consequence
that
it
dashed
over
a
bridge
into
the
seine
and
the
occupants
a
lady
and
two
little
children
were
drowned
before
his
eyes
there
no
need
to
be
nervous
if
you
take
proper
care
but
cars
are
not
playthings
to
be
trifled
with
they
had
reached
a
part
of
the
country
which
miss
beach
had
known
as
a
child
she
had
not
visited
it
since
and
was
interested
to
see
again
spots
which
had
once
been
familiar
i
remember
the
river
perfectly
she
said
and
that
hill
with
the
wood
where
we
used
to
get
blackberries
in
the
autumn
i
wonder
if
the
wild
daffodils
still
grow
in
chipden
marsh
it
fifty
years
since
i
gathered
them
shall
we
go
and
see
they
ought
just
to
be
out
now
and
it
really
not
late
yet
winona
was
only
too
delighted
to
prolong
the
day
outing
and
would
not
have
demurred
if
aunt
harriet
had
proposed
returning
home
by
moonlight
she
caught
eagerly
at
the
suggestion
of
finding
daffodils
though
had
sped
by
miss
beach
remembered
the
way
and
drove
through
many
to
a
tract
of
pasture
land
that
bordered
the
river
she
had
not
forgotten
the
stile
which
still
remained
as
of
yore
so
leaving
the
car
in
the
road
they
walked
down
the
fields
at
first
they
were
disappointed
but
further
on
beside
the
river
the
marsh
might
well
have
been
called
daffodil
meadow
everywhere
the
lovely
little
wild
lent
lilies
were
showing
their
golden
trumpets
in
such
profusion
among
the
grass
that
the
scene
resembled
famous
picture
of
spring
miss
beach
said
little
but
her
eyes
shone
with
reminiscences
winona
was
in
ecstasies
and
ran
about
picking
till
her
bunch
was
almost
too
big
to
hold
the
slanting
afternoon
sunlight
fell
on
the
water
with
a
glinting
glistening
sheen
the
sallows
overhanging
the
banks
were
yellow
with
pollen
the
young
pushing
arum
shoots
and
river
herbs
wore
their
tender
early
spring
hue
the
scene
was
an
idyll
in
green
and
gold
they
were
loath
to
leave
but
time
was
passing
so
very
reluctantly
they
walked
up
the
fields
again
to
rejoin
the
car
they
had
stowed
their
daffodils
in
the
lunch
basket
and
winona
was
peeping
over
the
hedge
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
river
when
an
exclamation
behind
her
made
her
turn
round
miss
beach
was
leaning
heavily
against
the
car
her
face
was
ashen
gray
her
lips
were
white
and
drawn
she
looked
ready
to
faint
winona
flew
to
her
in
a
panic
what
is
it
aunt
harriet
are
you
ill
get
into
the
car
and
sit
down
let
me
help
you
miss
beach
sank
on
to
the
seat
and
sat
with
eyes
moaning
feebly
winona
was
terribly
alarmed
she
had
seen
aunt
harriet
before
with
one
of
her
bad
heart
attacks
and
knew
that
restoratives
ought
to
be
given
in
this
lonely
spot
with
no
help
at
hand
what
was
to
be
done
suppose
her
aunt
were
to
faint
die
even
before
aid
could
be
rendered
for
a
moment
winona
shook
like
a
leaf
then
with
a
rush
her
presence
of
mind
returned
there
was
only
one
possible
course
she
herself
must
start
the
car
and
drive
to
within
reach
of
civilization
it
would
need
courage
it
was
one
thing
to
drive
with
an
experienced
instructor
at
her
elbow
to
shout
necessary
directions
but
quite
another
to
manage
alone
with
aunt
harriet
half
unconscious
beside
her
suppose
she
were
to
forget
part
of
her
motorists
catechism
and
make
some
horrible
fatal
mistake
well
it
must
be
ventured
all
the
same
every
minute
delay
was
important
with
a
nervous
shiver
she
forced
herself
to
action
she
looked
first
that
the
clutch
was
out
of
gear
and
that
the
ignition
was
pushed
back
then
swung
round
the
handle
to
start
the
engine
it
had
cooled
while
they
were
picking
daffodils
and
she
was
obliged
to
repeat
the
process
four
times
ere
the
welcome
whirring
answered
her
efforts
she
sprang
to
her
seat
took
off
the
brake
and
put
in
the
low
gear
then
she
put
the
clutch
in
with
her
foot
but
alas
in
her
tremor
and
hurry
she
had
done
it
too
suddenly
and
stopped
the
engine
she
could
have
cried
with
annoyance
at
her
stupidity
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
the
lever
again
at
neutral
put
on
the
brake
and
climb
out
to
the
handle
this
time
the
engine
being
warm
was
more
amiable
and
condescended
to
start
easily
winona
leaped
into
the
car
adjusted
her
levers
put
in
her
clutch
more
gradually
and
the
car
glided
slowly
away
with
a
feeling
of
desperation
she
gripped
the
steering
wheel
the
lane
was
narrow
and
twisting
and
not
too
smooth
suppose
she
were
to
meet
a
farm
cart
could
she
possibly
pass
it
in
safety
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
would
run
into
any
vehicle
that
might
approach
her
so
far
the
lane
was
empty
but
at
any
moment
an
obstacle
might
arise
what
was
that
there
was
a
sound
of
and
round
a
corner
ran
a
flock
of
sheep
urged
on
by
a
boy
and
a
collie
dog
here
was
the
first
human
being
she
had
seen
and
for
a
second
she
thought
of
stopping
to
ask
for
help
but
what
could
a
young
boy
do
for
her
no
it
were
better
far
to
push
on
she
managed
to
sound
the
hooter
and
with
a
supreme
effort
kept
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
while
the
sheep
scattered
to
right
and
left
she
dared
not
go
any
slower
for
fear
of
stopping
her
engine
but
she
expected
every
instant
to
feel
a
bump
and
find
that
she
had
run
over
one
of
the
flock
the
collie
did
his
duty
however
and
in
a
whirl
of
barking
shouting
and
she
steered
safely
through
the
danger
she
looked
anxiously
at
every
turning
for
fear
she
might
miss
her
way
her
object
was
to
regain
the
main
road
where
she
might
find
some
passing
motorist
and
implore
help
yes
there
was
the
where
aunt
harriet
had
halted
she
must
keep
to
the
left
by
that
ruined
cottage
she
remembered
noticing
its
broken
roof
as
they
had
passed
it
how
interminably
long
the
lanes
were
they
had
seemed
far
shorter
when
aunt
harriet
was
driving
oh
thank
goodness
there
was
the
big
oak
tree
it
could
not
be
far
now
a
few
minutes
more
and
winona
had
reached
the
and
swung
round
the
corner
into
the
crowland
road
she
felt
as
if
her
nerves
would
not
stand
very
much
more
would
help
never
come
a
distant
hooting
behind
her
made
her
heart
leap
she
stopped
the
car
beside
the
hedge
and
standing
up
waved
her
handkerchief
as
a
signal
of
distress
a
splendid
daimler
came
into
sight
would
the
chauffeur
notice
and
understand
her
plight
she
shrieked
in
desperation
as
it
whizzed
past
oh
it
was
stopping
a
gentleman
got
out
and
walked
quickly
back
towards
her
she
jumped
down
and
ran
to
meet
him
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
he
asked
politely
oh
please
my
aunt
is
very
ill
and
i
do
know
how
to
drive
properly
yet
how
am
i
going
to
get
back
to
seaton
blurted
out
winona
on
the
verge
of
tears
she
never
forgot
how
kind
the
stranger
was
with
the
aid
of
his
chauffeur
he
lifted
poor
aunt
harriet
into
his
own
car
and
told
winona
to
take
her
place
beside
her
now
tell
me
exactly
where
you
want
to
go
he
said
and
i
run
you
straight
home
as
fast
as
i
can
my
man
shall
follow
with
your
car
you
can
manage
this
little
jones
yes
sir
grinned
the
chauffeur
inspecting
the
levers
the
stranger
made
his
big
daimler
fly
winona
never
knew
by
how
much
he
exceeded
the
speed
limit
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
be
spinning
along
at
the
rate
of
nearly
fifty
miles
an
hour
aunt
harriet
had
recovered
a
little
though
she
still
moaned
at
intervals
the
hedges
seemed
to
whirl
past
them
they
went
hooting
through
villages
and
whizzed
over
a
common
at
last
the
familiar
spires
and
towers
of
seaton
appeared
in
the
distance
their
good
samaritan
drove
them
to
their
own
door
helped
miss
beach
into
the
house
and
volunteered
to
take
a
message
to
the
doctor
then
evading
winona
thanks
he
sprang
into
his
car
and
started
away
the
chauffeur
arrived
later
with
miss
beach
car
and
considerately
offered
to
run
it
round
to
the
garage
aunt
harriet
was
laid
up
for
several
days
after
this
episode
and
sidwell
forbade
any
long
expeditions
in
the
immediate
future
he
encouraged
the
idea
of
winona
learning
to
drive
you
could
be
of
the
greatest
help
in
taking
your
aunt
about
he
said
to
her
you
must
have
a
capital
notion
of
it
or
you
could
have
brought
the
car
three
miles
entirely
on
your
own
but
of
course
need
practice
before
you
can
be
trusted
to
mix
in
traffic
you
have
to
apply
for
a
license
remember
you
be
getting
into
trouble
if
you
drive
without
winona
looked
back
upon
that
outing
as
a
most
memorable
occasion
she
hoped
to
try
her
skill
again
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
the
charm
of
the
wheel
was
alluring
she
wished
she
knew
the
name
of
the
stranger
who
had
rendered
such
invaluable
assistance
but
that
she
never
learnt
illustration
winona
stopped
the
car
beside
the
hedge
and
standing
up
waved
her
handkerchief
as
a
signal
of
distress
chapter
xvi
the
athletic
display
the
easter
term
was
passing
quickly
away
it
had
been
a
strenuous
but
nevertheless
successful
season
out
of
nine
hockey
matches
the
team
had
lost
only
three
not
a
bad
record
for
a
school
that
was
still
in
the
infancy
of
its
games
reputation
the
old
girls
guild
had
got
up
its
eleven
and
had
practiced
with
enthusiasm
under
the
captaincy
of
kirsty
paterson
a
most
exciting
past
present
match
had
been
played
resulting
in
a
narrow
victory
for
the
school
winona
felt
prouder
of
this
success
than
of
any
other
triumph
the
team
had
scored
for
kirsty
had
congratulated
her
afterwards
and
praise
from
her
former
captain
was
very
sweet
it
had
been
the
last
match
of
the
season
so
it
made
a
satisfactory
finish
to
her
work
she
felt
quite
sentimental
as
she
put
by
her
next
season
there
would
be
a
fresh
captain
and
she
would
have
left
the
high
school
she
wished
she
were
staying
another
year
but
her
scholarship
would
expire
at
the
end
of
july
she
could
hardly
believe
that
she
had
been
nearly
two
years
at
the
school
and
that
only
one
term
more
remained
to
her
well
it
would
be
the
summer
term
which
was
the
pleasantest
of
all
and
though
hockey
was
over
she
had
the
cricket
season
before
her
the
seaton
high
should
score
at
the
wicket
if
it
were
in
her
power
to
coach
a
successful
team
towards
the
end
of
march
winona
had
an
interlude
which
for
the
time
took
her
thoughts
even
from
the
omnipresent
topic
of
sports
percy
who
had
been
in
training
with
his
regiment
at
duncastle
was
ordered
to
the
front
he
was
allowed
hours
leave
and
came
home
for
a
sunday
winona
spent
that
at
highfield
and
the
memory
of
it
always
remained
a
very
precious
one
percy
in
his
khaki
seemed
much
changed
and
though
she
only
had
him
for
a
few
minutes
quite
to
herself
she
felt
that
the
old
tie
between
them
had
strengthened
her
letters
to
him
in
future
would
be
different
during
the
last
year
they
had
both
slacked
a
little
in
their
correspondence
each
perhaps
unconsciously
feeling
that
the
other
standpoint
was
changing
now
they
had
met
again
on
a
new
basis
and
realized
once
more
a
common
bond
of
sympathy
percy
absorbed
in
describing
his
new
life
scarcely
mentioned
aunt
harriet
the
episode
of
the
burning
of
the
paper
seemed
to
have
faded
from
his
memory
or
he
had
conveniently
buried
it
in
oblivion
winona
had
never
forgotten
it
it
remained
still
the
one
shadow
in
her
career
at
seaton
now
especially
since
miss
beach
recent
the
secret
weighed
heavily
upon
her
she
felt
her
aunt
ought
to
know
that
the
will
was
destroyed
so
that
she
might
take
the
opportunity
of
making
another
more
than
once
she
tried
indirectly
to
refer
to
the
subject
but
it
was
a
tender
topic
and
at
the
least
hint
miss
beach
face
would
stiffen
and
her
voice
harden
the
old
barrier
between
them
would
rise
up
again
wider
than
ever
and
impossible
to
be
spanned
winona
would
have
been
glad
to
do
much
for
her
aunt
but
miss
beach
did
not
care
to
be
treated
as
an
invalid
like
many
energetic
people
she
refused
to
acknowledge
that
she
was
ill
and
the
acceptance
of
little
services
seemed
to
her
a
confession
of
her
own
weakness
it
is
rather
hard
to
have
your
kindly
meant
efforts
repulsed
so
winona
finding
that
her
offers
of
sympathy
met
with
no
response
drew
back
into
her
shell
and
the
two
continued
to
live
as
before
on
terms
of
friendship
but
never
of
intimacy
after
almost
two
years
spent
in
the
same
house
winona
knew
her
aunt
little
better
than
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
they
had
certain
common
grounds
for
conversation
but
their
mutual
reserve
was
maintained
and
as
regarded
each
other
real
thoughts
they
remained
strangers
yet
miss
beach
however
took
an
interest
in
winona
doings
at
school
she
read
her
monthly
reports
and
scolded
her
if
her
work
had
fallen
below
standard
she
expressed
a
guarded
pleasure
over
successful
matches
but
rubbed
in
the
moral
that
games
must
not
usurp
her
attention
to
the
detriment
of
her
form
subjects
you
came
here
to
learn
something
more
than
hockey
she
would
remind
winona
it
a
splendid
exercise
but
i
afraid
it
wo
prove
a
career
i
should
like
to
see
a
better
record
for
latin
and
chemistry
they
might
very
well
have
more
attention
winona
had
tried
to
persuade
her
aunt
to
come
and
watch
one
of
the
matches
but
miss
beach
had
always
found
some
engagement
she
was
concerned
in
so
many
of
the
city
activities
that
her
time
was
generally
carefully
mapped
out
weeks
beforehand
she
consented
however
to
accept
miss
bishop
invitation
to
the
gymnasium
display
which
was
to
be
given
at
the
high
school
at
the
close
of
the
easter
term
this
was
a
very
important
occasion
in
the
estimation
of
the
girls
it
was
their
first
athletic
show
since
the
advent
of
miss
barbour
the
swedish
drill
mistress
governors
and
parents
were
to
be
present
and
the
excellence
of
the
performance
must
justify
the
large
amount
which
had
been
spent
upon
gymnastic
apparatus
during
the
past
year
for
two
whole
terms
miss
barbour
had
been
teaching
and
training
her
classes
with
a
view
to
this
exhibition
and
woe
betide
any
unlucky
wight
whose
nerves
memory
or
muscles
should
fail
her
at
the
critical
moment
a
further
impetus
was
given
to
individual
effort
by
the
offer
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
governors
of
four
medals
for
competition
to
be
awarded
respectively
to
the
best
candidates
in
four
classes
seniors
over
intermediates
from
to
juniors
from
to
and
preparatories
under
it
was
felt
throughout
the
school
that
the
offer
was
munificent
the
governors
had
been
stingy
over
the
matter
of
the
hockey
field
and
had
been
reviled
accordingly
but
councillor
jackson
was
retrieving
the
character
of
the
board
by
this
action
and
the
girls
reversed
their
opinion
in
his
favor
they
hoped
that
other
governors
warmed
by
his
example
might
open
their
hearts
in
silver
medals
or
book
prizes
for
future
occasions
he
a
dear
old
trump
to
think
of
it
said
winona
you
drew
a
picture
of
him
floundering
in
the
mud
at
hockey
twinkled
garnet
well
i
forgive
him
now
and
i
draw
another
of
him
standing
on
the
platform
all
beaming
with
benevolence
and
distributing
medals
broadcast
look
here
bessie
kirk
you
need
be
congratulating
yourself
beforehand
with
such
a
patently
smirk
because
going
to
win
the
senior
medal
no
you
not
my
child
take
it
patiently
and
compose
your
mind
the
medal
coming
this
way
how
about
me
put
in
marjorie
kemp
you
do
well
but
you
not
a
champion
you
too
fat
jumbo
and
that
the
fact
you
all
right
when
it
a
question
of
brute
strength
but
when
agility
matters
those
superfluous
pounds
of
flesh
of
yours
are
an
impediment
i
back
joyce
sooner
than
you
she
as
light
as
a
feather
hearing
herself
commended
joyce
fluttered
up
to
the
group
smiling
i
did
four
feet
six
yesterday
she
announced
and
i
have
cleared
four
feet
seven
i
believe
only
i
had
to
stop
it
always
my
luck
why
had
you
to
stop
my
back
ached
instant
apprehension
overspread
the
faces
of
her
friends
joyce
newton
exclaimed
winona
you
never
going
to
get
again
and
stop
the
athletic
display
you
do
feel
sick
or
or
do
you
implored
bessie
for
goodness
sake
stand
away
if
you

i
want

as
you

hearty
but
do
disseminate
germs
if
the
athletic
display
does
come
off
i
break
my
heart
and
you
can
write
an
epitaph
over
me
here
lies
one
who
young
in
years
left
this
mortal
vale
of
tears
cruel
fate
hath
knocked
her
down
tom
from
her
the
laurel
crown
to
win
the
gym
display
she
sighed
but
as
she
might
not
jump
she
died
look
here
said
marjorie
i
suppose
the
medal
lies
fairly
well
between
us
four
i
vote
that
we
make
a
compact
whoever
wins
treats
the
other
three
to
ices
it
would
be
some
compensation
for
losing
good
for

i
game

bessie
if
you

they
be
strawberry
ices
stipulated
winona
i
may

me
wailed
joyce
but
if

it
chocolates

i
wo
forget
ices
for
bessie
and
winona
and
a
packet
of
cadbury
for
joyce
i
go
and
be
ordering
them
chirruped
marjorie
dancing
away
cheek
do
make
so
sure
it
medal
so
be
getting
your
handkerchiefs
ready
maintained
winona
though
winona
just
for
the
fun
of
teasing
her
friends
had
pretended
to
appropriate
the
prize
she
had
really
no
anticipation
of
winning
she
was
fairly
good
at
gymnasium
work
but
could
not
be
considered
a
champion
she
knew
her
success
or
failure
would
depend
very
much
on
luck
if
she
happened
to
feel
in
the
right
mood
she
might
achieve
something
but
it
was
an
even
chance
that
at
the
critical
moment
her
courage
might
fail
her
in
a
match
she
was
generally
swept
away
by
the
intense
feeling
of
cooperation
the
knowledge
that
all
her
team
were
striving
for
a
common
cause
buoyed
her
up
but
in
a
competition
where
each
was
for
herself
the
element
of
nervousness
would
have
greater
scope
when
she
thought
about
it
she
felt
that
she
would
probably
be
shaking
with
fright
the
great
day
came
at
last
the
gymnasium
was
decorated
with
flags
in
honor
of
the
occasion
and
pots
of
palms
were
placed
upon
the
platform
where
the
governors
and
a
few
of
the
most
distinguished
visitors
were
accommodated
with
seats
winona
marching
in
to
take
part
in
the
senior
drill
gave
one
glance
round
the
building
and
grasped
the
fact
that
aunt
harriet
was
sitting
on
the
platform
next
to
councillor
jackson
and
only
a
few
places
away
from
the
expert
who
was
to
act
as
judge
she
was
chatting
affably
with
her
august
companions
think
of
chatting
with
a
governor
winona
felt
that
it
was
some
credit
to
have
such
a
relation
she
had
not
always
been
very
sure
how
much
she
valued
aunt
opinion
but
this
afternoon
she
longed
to
shine
before
her
yet
the
very
wish
to
do
so
made
her
nervous
she
glanced
at
her
companions
bessie
was
looking
stolidity
itself
marjorie
usually
high
color
had
reached
peony
point
joyce
was
palpably
in
the
throes
of
stage
fright
all
were
soon
marching
and
countermarching
swinging
indian
clubs
and
performing
the
intricate
maneuvers
of
swedish
drill
fortunately
they
had
practiced
well
and
it
went
without
a
hitch
they
breathed
more
freely
as
they
retired
to
the
to
make
way
for
the
babies
who
were
to
do
skipping
exercises
to
music
it
more
awful
to
show
off
before
governors
than
i
expected
sighed
joyce
i
just
shivering
what
you
be
at
the
rings
then
asked
bessie
silence
urged
miss
lever
who
was
in
charge
of
the
the
strains
of
little
grey
home
in
the
west
and
the
regular
thud
of
small
feet
were
wafted
from
the
gymnasium
do
you
wish
you
were
a
kid
again
whispered
joyce
no
i
do
retorted
bessie
so
imprudently
loud
that
miss
lever
glared
at
her
it
horrid
having
to
stay
in
here
where
one
ca
see
murmured
marjorie
under
her
breath
they
knew
by
the
music
however
what
was
taking
place
the
juniors
were
doing
wand
exercises
the
intermediates
followed
with
clubs
our
turn
again
soon
whispered
winona
olave
parry
from
a
vantage
post
near
the
door
could
see
into
the
gymnasium
and
report
progress
her
items
of
news
passed
in
whispers
down
the
ranks
the
babies
had
skipped
like
a
row
of
cherubs
and
the
governors
were
wreathed
in
smiles
kitty
carter
had
dropped
one
of
her
clubs
and
it
nearly
hit
a
visitor
on
the
head
but
fortunately
missed
her
by
half
an
inch
laura
marshall
was
performing
prodigies
on
the
horizontal
ladder
she
undoubtedly
had
a
chance
for
a
medal
bursts
of
applause
from
the
audience
punctuated
the
performance
olave
continued
her
report
which
miss
lever
who
took
occasional
excursions
into
the
gymnasium
verified
from
time
to
time
the
juniors
were
competing
now
natalie
powers
was
about
to
do
the
ring
exercises
it
was
a
swing
and
a
in
front
and
she
managed
that
neatly
but
when
it
came
to
the
swing
and
the
turn
she
lost
her
nerve
turned
too
soon
and
spun
round
helplessly
in
the
air
until
miss
barbour
hurried
to
her
aid
natalie
was
done
for
without
doubt
it
was
a
good
thing
she
had
not
fallen
and
hurt
herself
her
rivals
were
madge
collins
had
reached
the
top
in
six
seconds
and
was
sliding
down
again
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
clapping
lennie
roberts
had
beaten
her
for
she
had
performed
the
same
feat
in
exactly
five
seconds
the
juniors
were
in
a
ferment
of
excitement
the
interest
of
the
audience
had
waxed
to
enthusiasm
point
seniors
announced
miss
lever
briefly
and
the
row
of
waiting
figures
in
the
fell
into
line
and
marched
into
the
gymnasium
for
the
special
trials
the
swedish
drill
exercises
where
all
worked
together
had
not
seemed
half
so
formidable
a
well
practiced
part
is
not
easily
forgotten
even
by
a
nervous
girl
if
it
must
be
done
in
company
with
others
it
was
another
matter
however
to
perform
single
athletic
feats
before
a
big
audience
for
a
moment
winona
turned
almost
dizzy
with
fright
the
big
room
seemed
full
of
eyes
every
one
of
which
would
be
watching
her
when
it
came
to
her
turn
she
looked
round
with
the
feeling
of
a
martyr
in
the
arena
and
for
a
moment
met
the
calm
steady
gaze
of
miss
beach
winona
said
afterwards
that
aunt
harriet
must
have
mesmerized
her
for
in
that
second
of
recognition
she
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
courage
the
thrill
of
the
contest
took
possession
of
her
and
every
nerve
and
muscle
every
atom
of
her
brain
was
alert
to
do
its
best
she
would
let
aunt
harriet
see
that
though
she
might
fail
sometimes
in
form
work
she
could
hold
her
own
at
gymnastics
contestants
climbed
traveled
on
rings
and
vaulted
the
horse
winona
seemed
to
herself
as
easy
and
agile
as
she
had
ever
been
she
had
a
possible
chance
of
winning
and
her
heart
exulted
then
came
the
ladders
up
and
up
she
went
holding
herself
now
by
her
hands
and
now
by
her
feet
swinging
for
her
hold
she
had
thought
she
was
light
but
now
she
suddenly
realized
how
heavy
she
was
she
summoned
every
bit
of
strength
as
she
went
down
the
ladder
from
one
contest
to
another
she
passed
doing
her
best
last
of
all
came
the
rings
winona
swung
out
grasped
the
next
ring
and
so
on
down
the
line
oh
how
many
there
were
she
had
never
before
realized
what
it
meant
to
weigh
lbs
she
held
her
breath
as
she
reached
for
the
next
ring
but
it
slipped
from
her
fingers
only
for
a
second
however
for
she
caught
it
on
the
next
swing
and
a
moment
later
was
waiting
at
the
end
bessie
was
just
starting
down
the
line
she
traveled
not
so
gracefully
perhaps
as
winona
but
catching
her
ring
on
every
swing
joyce
followed
but
her
courage
deserted
her
and
she
failed
utterly
marjorie
came
next
she
was
doing
well
surely
she
was
nearly
through
reached
for
the
last
ring
missed
it
and
fell
there
was
an
instant
murmur
of
consternation
from
the
audience
was
she
injured
she
sprang
up
unhurt
however
though
deeply
humiliated
thrilling
in
every
nerve
winona
started
back
refreshed
by
her
little
rest
she
swung
lightly
steadily
and
unfalteringly
never
missing
a
ring
till
she
came
to
the
end
she
was
almost
too
occupied
to
notice
the
cheers
bessie
reached
then
missed
a
ring
caught
it
on
the
second
swing
missed
another
and
reached
for
it
three
times
before
she
caught
it
and
finished
her
course
the
girls
had
been
too
much
excited
for
comparisons
they
scarcely
guessed
how
their
averages
would
stand
winona
had
a
general
impression
that
bessie
had
scored
at
vaulting
and
marjorie
had
undoubtedly
cleared
the
rope
at
four
feet
eight
her
own
performances
seemed
lost
in
a
haze
she
had
noticed
the
judge
jot
down
something
but
she
felt
incapable
of
reckoning
her
chances
the
judge
was
conferring
with
miss
bishop
at
the
back
of
the
platform
and
while
the
room
waited
for
their
decision
the
school
marched
singing
an
empire
song
at
last
the
judge
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
platform
the
singing
ceased
winona
heart
beat
suffocatingly
i
have
great
pleasure
in
giving
the
results

the
judge

the
applause
was
ringing
out
lustily
bessie
marjorie
and
joyce
were
pressing
congratulations
upon
her
miss
bishop
actually
the
head
was
looking
at
her
and
smiling
approval
miss
lever
was
telling
her
to
walk
forward
in
a
delirious
whirl
winona
climbed
the
steps
on
the
platform
as
councillor
jackson
pinned
the
medal
on
to
her
tunic
a
storm
of
clapping
and
cheers
rose
from
the
school
their
games
captain
was
popular
and
everybody
felt
it
right
and
fitting
that
this
afternoon
she
should
have
proved
herself
the
athletic
champion
do
forget
the
ices
whispered
bessie
as
winona
rejoined
marjorie
and
joyce
we
stop
at
the
café
on
the
way
home
and
you
shall
each
choose
what
you
like
declared
winona

spendthrift
liberality
chapter
xvii
back
to
the
land
easter
fell
late
so
winona
spent
the
lovely
early
part
of
may
at
her
own
home
after
so
many
weeks
of
town
it
was
delightful
to
be
once
more
in
the
country
she
worked
with
enthusiasm
in
the
garden
mowed
the
lawn
and
with
letty
and
mamie
help
began
to
put
up
an
arbor
over
which
she
hoped
to
persuade
a
crimson
rambler
to
ramble
successfully
in
the
house
she
tried
her
hand
at
scones
and
cakes
entirely
to
the
children
satisfaction
if
not
altogether
to
her
own
she
enjoyed
experiments
in
cooking
for
she
had
longed
to
join
the
domestic
science
class
at
school
and
had
felt
aggrieved
when
miss
bishop
decided
that
her
was
full
enough
without
it
she
found
her
mother
looking
delicate
and
worried
poor
woodward
health
had
not
improved
during
the
last
two
years
she
was
nervous
anxious
about
percy
and
inclined
to
be
fretful
and
tearful
the
increased
and
the
added
cost
of
living
made
her
constantly
full
of
financial
cares
she
was
not
a
very
good
manager
and
the
thought
of
the
future
oppressed
her
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
with
you
winona
when
you
leave
school
she
remarked
plaintively
one
evening
i
feel
that
you
ought
to
go
in
for
something
but
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
hoped
you
were
going
to
turn
out
clever
and
win
a
scholarship
for
college
and
get
a
good
post
as
a
teacher
afterwards
but
there
does
seem
the
least
chance
of
your
doing
that
it
all
very
well
this
hockey
and
cricket
that
made
such
a
fuss
of
at
schools
nowadays
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
going
to
lead
to
anything
i
rather
you
stuck
to
your
books
yes
your
future
worrying
me
very
much
i
all
these
little
ones
to
bring
up
and
educate
and
i
hoped
you
be
able
to
earn
your
own
living
before
long
and
lend
the
children
a
helping
hand
i
spend
anything
on
giving
you
an
expensive
training
percy
has
cost
me
so
much
out
of
capital
and
it
letty
turn
next
besides
which
it
high
time
ernie
and
godfrey
were
packed
off
to
a
oh
dear
i
never
seem
free
from
trouble
it
no
light
anxiety
to
be
the
mother
of
seven
children
i
often
wonder
what
will
become
of
you
all
to
winona
her
mother
tearful
confidences
came
as
a
shock
up
to
the
present
she
had
been
so
intensely
interested
in
school
affairs
that
she
had
given
scarcely
a
thought
to
her
future
career
life
had
existed
for
her
in
detail
only
to
the
end
of
the
summer
term
after
that
it
had
stretched
a
nebulous
void
into
which
her
imagination
had
never
troubled
to
penetrate
now
she
took
herself
seriously
to
task
and
tried
to
face
the
prospect
of
the
time
when
she
would
have
left
the
seaton
high
school
there
were
many
occupations
open
to
girls
nowadays
besides
teaching
they
could
be
doctors
secretaries
sanitary
inspectors
artists
musicians
poultry
farmers
she
knew
however
that
for
any
career
worth
taking
up
a
considerable
training
would
be
necessary
and
a
certain
amount
of
expense
involved
what
she
would
have
liked
very
much
would
be
to
study
at
a
physical
training
college
and
qualify
to
become
a
drill
and
games
mistress
but
this
seemed
as
unattainable
as
taking
a
medical
course
or
going
to
girton
or
newnham
i
too
young
yet
for
a
hospital
nurse
she
pondered
and
not
clever
enough
to
be
an
artist
or
a
musician
well
i
suppose
i
can
make
munitions
or
go
on
the
land
women
are
wanted
on
farms
while
the
war
lasts
i
could
earn
my
own
living
perhaps
but
oh
dear
that
be
boosting
on
the
children
i
afraid
mother
fearfully
disappointed
with
me
she
seemed
to
be
looking
at
things
in
a
new
light
and
to
see
her
position
as
it
affected
others
she
was
young
and
brave
surely
it
was
her
part
to
shoulder
the
family
burdens
to
shield
the
frail
little
mother
who
grew
less
and
less
able
to
cope
with
difficulties
to
hold
out
a
strong
helping
hand
to
the
younger
brothers
and
sisters
and
so
justify
her
existence
on
this
planet
it
had
not
before
occurred
to
her
how
much
her
home
people
relied
on
her
the
thought
of
it
brought
a
great
lump
into
her
throat
she
must
not
fail
them
she
could
not
yet
see
her
way
clearly
but
somehow
she
must
be
a
comfort
and
a
support
to
them
that
she
was
quite
resolved
she
went
back
to
school
in
a
very
thoughtful
frame
of
mind
her
last
term
would
be
a
full
one
in
many
ways
about
half
of
the
sixth
form
were
to
go
in
for
their
college
entrance
examinations
and
miss
bishop
had
decreed
that
winona
as
a
county
scholarship
holder
must
certainly
be
among
the
number
she
had
little
hope
of
passing
for
most
of
her
subjects
were
weak
but
she
meant
to
make
an
effort
to
try
to
pick
up
some
of
her
lost
ground
her
old
enemies
latin
and
chemistry
still
often
baffled
her
and
her
memory
was
only
moderately
retentive
she
could
not
honestly
believe
that
so
far
as
her
work
was
concerned
she
was
any
credit
to
the
school
games
were
another
matter
however
and
so
long
as
they
did
not
seriously
interfere
with
her
preparation
for
the
matriculation
she
meant
to
do
her
duty
as
captain
she
arranged
cricket
fixtures
and
tennis
tournaments
and
though
she
could
not
devote
as
much
of
her
own
time
as
she
would
have
liked
to
practice
she
spurred
on
others
who
had
more
leisure
than
herself
she
certainly
possessed
a
gift
for
organization
there
are
some
captains
splendid
players
themselves
who
can
never
train
their
deputies
as
napoleon
genius
was
supposed
to
lie
largely
in
his
capacity
for
picking
out
able
generals
so
winona
proved
her
ability
by
choosing
helpers
who
were
of
real
service
to
her
with
audrey
redfern
emily
cooper
and
bertha
march
to
the
fore
she
hoped
that
both
cricket
and
tennis
would
prosper
and
that
the
school
would
score
as
successfully
during
the
summer
as
it
had
done
in
the
hockey
season
on
the
first
saturday
after
the
beginning
of
the
term
miss
beach
announced
that
she
was
going
to
spend
the
day
with
a
friend
who
lived
five
miles
out
of
seaton
and
that
if
winona
had
leisure
to
accompany
her
she
would
be
pleased
to
take
her
no
practices
had
been
arranged
for
that
afternoon
so
winona
felt
free
to
accept
the
invitation
she
had
been
for
several
short
runs
in
the
car
but
for
no
long
expedition
since
the
memorable
outing
to
wickborough
so
the
prospect
of
a
day
in
the
country
was
alluring
they
started
at
about
eleven
and
took
a
road
that
was
new
to
winona
consequently
all
the
more
interesting
their
way
led
through
lovely
woods
at
present
a
sheet
of
blue
hyacinths
the
hedges
were
a
filmy
dream
of
blackthorn
blossom
while
the
swallows
wheeling
and
flashing
in
the
sunshine
testified
to
the
return
of
summer
miss
carson
the
lady
whom
they
were
going
to
visit
like
most
of
aunt
harriet
friends
was
engaged
in
very
interesting
work
she
had
taken
a
small
holding
and
with
the
help
of
a
few
women
pupils
was
running
it
as
a
fruit
flower
and
poultry
farm
the
house
an
old
cottage
to
which
she
had
added
a
wing
was
charmingly
pretty
it
was
long
and
low
with
a
thick
thatched
roof
and
a
porch
overgrown
with
starry
white
clematis
a
budding
vine
covered
the
front
and
in
the
border
below
great
clumps
of
stately
yellow
lilies
drooped
their
queenly
heads
the
front
door
led
straight
into
the
house
place
a
square
room
with
a
big
and
cozy
ingle
nooks
it
was
very
simply
furnished
but
looked
most
artistic
with
its
chairs
its
few
good
pictures
and
its
stained
green
table
with
the
big
bowl
of
wallflowers
miss
carson
a
delightfully
energetic
lady
whose
age
may
have
been
somewhere
between
thirty
and
forty
welcomed
them
cordially
i
do
apologize
for
the
plainness
of
my
establishment
she
remarked
it
all
part
of
a
purpose
we
have
no
servants
here
and
as
we
have
to
do
our
own
in
addition
to
our
we
want
to
reduce
our
labor
to
a
minimum
you
see
there
hardly
anything
to
dust
in
this
room
the
books
and
the
china
are
in
those
two
cupboards
with
glass
doors
and
we
have
no
fripperies
at
all
lying
about
the
only
ornament
we
allow
ourselves
is
the
bowl
of
flowers
our
bedrooms
are
equally
simple
and
our
kitchen
is
fitted
with
the
latest
and
most
appliances
one
of
my
students
is
preparing
the
dinner
there
now
she
a
nice
girl
and
winona
will
perhaps
like
to
go
and
talk
to
her
unless
she
prefers
to
stay
here
with
us
winona
promptly
decided
in
favor
of
the
kitchen
so
miss
carson
escorted
her
there
and
introduced
her
to
miss
heald
a
girl
of
about
twenty
who
enveloped
in
a
blue
overall
pinafore
was
putting
plates
to
heat
and
inspecting
the
contents
of
certain
boilerettes
and
casseroles
like
the
the
kitchen
contained
no
unnecessary
articles
it
was
spotlessly
clean
and
looked
very
we
go
on
kitchen
duty
for
a
week
at
a
time
explained
miss
heald
to
winona
it
a
part
of
the
course
you
know
we
have
dairy
gardening
and
poultry
as
well
which
do
i
like
best
it
hard
to
say
poultry
i
think
because
the
chickens
are
such
darlings
i
show
you
all
round
the
place
this
afternoon
when
i
finished
washing
up
i
going
to
lay
the
table
now
you
can
help
if
you
like
precisely
at
one
the
seven
other
students
came
in
from
their
work
each
was
dressed
in
her
farm
uniform
short
serge
skirt
woolen
jersey
blue
overall
and
thick
boots
to
judge
from
their
looks
their
occupation
was
both
healthy
and
congenial
in
physique
they
were
hebes
and
their
spirits
seemed
at
bubbling
point
apparently
they
all
adored
miss
carson
the
latter
made
a
few
inquiries
as
to
the
progress
and
the
capable
answers
testified
to
the
knowledge
of
the
learners
the
dinner
did
credit
to
miss
heald
skill
it
was
well
cooked
and
daintily
served
winona
was
full
of
admiration
her
culinary
experience
was
limited
so
far
to
cakes
and
scones
she
felt
that
she
would
have
been
very
proud
if
she
had
compounded
that
stew
and
baked
those
custards
when
the
meal
was
finished
the
students
tramped
forth
again
to
their
outdoor
labor
while
miss
heald
cleared
away
winona
begged
to
be
allowed
to
help
her
and
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
very
latest
and
most
sanitary
method
of
washing
up
with
the
aid
of
mop
and
some
patent
appliances
it
was
so
interesting
that
she
quite
enjoyed
it
she
swept
the
kitchen
filled
kettles
at
the
pump
and
did
several
other
odd
jobs
then
everything
being
left
in
an
absolutely
immaculate
condition
miss
heald
declared
that
she
was
ready
and
offered
to
take
her
companion
for
a
tour
of
inspection
round
the
farm
the
little
holding
had
been
well
planned
and
was
skillfully
arranged
in
front
was
the
garden
a
large
piece
of
ground
stretching
down
to
the
hedge
that
bordered
the
road
miss
carson
original
idea
had
been
the
culture
of
flowers
partly
for
the
sale
of
their
blossoms
and
partly
for
the
preservation
of
their
seeds
but
the
national
need
of
producing
food
crops
during
the
war
had
induced
her
to
plant
almost
the
whole
of
it
with
fruit
and
vegetables
at
present
it
somewhat
resembled
a
village
allotment
patches
of
peas
and
broad
beans
were
coming
up
well
groups
of
gooseberry
bushes
were
thriving
strawberry
beds
were
being
carefully
weeded
and
two
of
the
students
were
erecting
posts
round
them
over
which
nets
would
be
hung
later
on
to
protect
the
fruit
from
the
birds
birds
are
our
greatest
pest
here
explained
miss
heald
one
may
like
them
from
a
natural
history
point
of
view
but
you
get
to
hate
the
little
wretches
when
you
see
them
devouring
everything
wholesale
they
no
conscience
those
small
coletits
can
creep
through
quite
fine
meshes
and
simply
strip
the
peas
and
the
blackbirds
would
guzzle
all
day
if
they
had
the
chance
i
want
to
borrow
an
air
gun
and
pot
at
them
but
miss
carson
wo
let
me
she
afraid
i
might
shoot
some
of
the
other
students
a
row
of
cucumber
frames
and
some
greenhouses
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
the
latter
were
mostly
devoted
to
young
tomato
plants
though
one
was
specially
reserved
for
vegetable
marrows
the
students
had
to
learn
how
to
manage
and
regulate
the
heating
apparatus
of
the
houses
as
well
as
to
understand
the
culture
of
the
plants
i
left
a
window
open
once
confessed
miss
heald
i
remembered
it
when
i
had
been
about
an
hour
in
bed
and
i
jumped
up
and
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
went
out
with
a
lantern
to
shut
it
fortunately
there
was
no
frost
that
night
or
all
the
seedlings
might
have
been
killed
it
was
a
most
dreadful
thing
to
forget
i
thought
miss
carson
would
have
jumped
on
me
but
she
was
ever
so
nice
about
it
despite
the
predominance
of
foodstuffs
there
were
a
few
flowers
in
the
garden
clumps
of
and
narcissus
purple
iris
golden
saxifrages
and
scarlet
anemones
there
were
fragrant
bushes
of
lavender
and
rosemary
and
beds
of
sweet
herbs
thyme
and
basil
and
fennel
and
salsafy
for
miss
carson
believed
in
some
of
the
remedies
and
made
salves
and
ointments
and
hair
washes
from
the
products
of
her
garden
the
orchard
full
of
apple
trees
was
a
refreshing
sight
they
opened
a
little
gate
and
walked
under
a
wealth
of
drooping
flowers
to
the
poultry
yard
that
lay
at
the
further
side
everything
here
was
on
the
most
system
pens
of
beautiful
white
leghorns
black
minorcas
and
buff
orpingtons
were
kept
in
wired
inclosures
each
with
its
own
henhouse
and
full
of
straw
miss
heald
took
winona
inside
to
inspect
the
patent
and
the
machine
she
also
showed
her
the
incubators
they
empty
now
but
you
should
have
seen
them
in
the
early
spring
when
they
were
full
of
eggs
she
explained
it
was
a
tremendous
anxiety
to
keep
the
lamps
properly
regulated
miss
nelson
and
i
sat
up
all
night
once
when
some
prize
ducklings
were
hatching
it
was
cold
weather
and
they
were
very
strong
so
they
needed
a
little
help
it
the
most
frightfully
delicate
work
to
help
a
chick
out
of
its
shell
it
makes
a
little
chip
with
its
beak
and
then
sometimes
it
get
any
further
and
you
have
gently
to
crack
the
hole
bigger
unless
you
very
careful
you
may
kill
it
but
on
the
other
hand
if
it
burst
its
shell
when
it
ready
to
hatch
it
may
suffocate
so
it
a
choice
of
evils
we
put
them
in
the
drying
pen
first
and
then
in
the
mother
they
like
babies
and
have
to
be
fed
every
two
hours
it
a
tremendous
business
when
you
have
hundreds
of
them
at
different
stages
and
on
different
diets
we
seemed
to
be
preparing
food
all
day
long
it
ever
so
fascinating
though
i
love
them
when
they
like
fluffy
canaries
said
winona
yes
so
do
i
had
a
special
sitting
of
little
ducklings
under
my
charge
and
they
got
very
tame
i
put
them
into
a
basket
one
day
and
carried
them
into
the
garden
to
pick
up
worms
i
put
them
down
on
a
bed
and
while
my
back
was
turned
for
a
few
minutes
they
cleared
a
whole
row
of
young
cabbages
that
miss
morrison
had
just
planted
i
got
into
fearful
trouble
and
had
to
pack
up
my
and
take
them
back
to
their
coop
in
disgrace
i
never
dreamed
they
would
devour
green
stuff
we
have
to
learn
to
keep
strict
accounts
of
the
poultry
we
put
down
the
number
of
eggs
daily
and
the
weekly
food
bill
and
the
chickens
sold
and
make
a
kind
of
register
with
profit
and
loss
miss
carson
runs
everything
on
a
most
basis
miss
heald
showed
winona
the
where
meal
and
grain
were
kept
the
big
pans
in
which
food
was
mixed
the
boxes
for
packing
eggs
and
the
little
medicine
cupboard
containing
remedies
for
sick
fowls
all
was
beautifully
orderly
and
well
arranged
and
a
card
of
rules
for
the
help
of
the
students
hung
on
the
walls
from
the
poultry
department
they
passed
to
the
dairy
section
the
four
sleek
cows
were
out
in
the
field
but
in
a
loose
box
there
were
some
delightful
calves
that
ran
to
greet
miss
heald
pressing
eager
damp
noses
into
her
hand
and
exhibiting
much
apparent
disappointment
that
she
did
not
offer
them
a
pailful
of
milk
and
oatmeal
winona
inspected
the
cool
scrupulously
clean
dairy
with
its
patent
churn
and
slate
slabs
for
making
up
the
butter
she
saw
the
bowls
where
the
cream
was
kept
and
the
wooden
print
with
which
the
pats
were
marked
is
the
side
of
the
business
i
do
care
for
admitted
miss
heald
i
like
the
gardening
fairly
well
and
i
just
love
the
poultry
but
i
do
take
to
dairy
work
of
course
it
a
part
of
my
training
so
i
obliged
to
do
it
but
when
my
time
here
is
over
i
mean
to
make
hens
my
specialty
and
go
in
for
poultry
farming
an
life
suits
me
it
a
thousand
times
nicer
than
being
a
nurse
at
a
hospital
or
a
secretary
at
an
office
you
in
the
fresh
air
all
day
and
the
chicks
are
so
interesting
a
pen
of
young
turkey
poults
a
flock
of
goslings
and
a
sty
full
of
infant
pigs
were
next
on
exhibition
miss
heald
showed
off
the
latter
with
pride
they
rather
darlings
and
i
own
to
a
weakness
for
them
she
admitted
we
put
them
in
a
bath
and
scrub
them
and
they
really
so
intelligent
was
it
the
poet
herrick
who
had
a
pet
pig
this
little
chap
as
sharp
as
a
needle
i
believe
i
could
teach
him
tricks
directly
if
i
tried
miss
carson
says
i
must
let
myself
grow
too
fond
of
all
the
creatures
because
their
ultimate
end
is
bacon
or
the
boilerette
and
it
does
do
to
be
sentimental
over
farming
but
i
ca
help
it
i
just
love
some
of
the
chickens
they
come
flying
up
on
to
my
shoulder
like
pigeons
a
pony
formed
part
of
the
establishment
twice
a
week
he
was
harnessed
to
the
trap
and
miss
carson
and
one
of
the
students
drove
to
seaton
to
dispose
of
the
farm
produce
miss
carson
had
undertaken
to
supply
several
hotels
and
restaurants
with
eggs
fowls
and
vegetables
and
so
far
had
found
the
demand
for
her
goods
exceeded
the
supply
labor
was
at
present
her
greatest
difficulty
her
students
accomplished
the
light
work
but
could
not
do
heavy
digging
she
managed
to
secure
the
occasional
services
of
a
farm
hand
but
with
most
men
at
the
war
the
problem
of
trenching
or
of
making
an
asparagus
bed
was
almost
impossible
to
solve
at
the
end
of
the
orchard
against
a
south
hedge
of
thick
holly
stood
the
hives
was
one
of
the
most
successful
ventures
of
the
holding
last
autumn
had
shown
a
splendid
yield
of
honey
and
this
year
judging
by
the
activity
of
the
bees
an
equal
harvest
might
be
expected
there
was
continuous
humming
among
the
apple
blossoms
and
every
minute
workers
were
hurrying
home
with
their
spoils
miss
heald
lifted
the
lid
of
one
of
the
hives
to
show
winona
the
comb
within
she
observed
caution
however
they
do
know
me
very
well
she
explained
they
have
their
likes
and
dislikes
miss
hunter
can
let
them
crawl
all
over
her
hands
and
arms
and
they
never
sting
her
she
must
have
a
natural
attraction
for
them
they
recognize
a
stranger
directly
no
i
not
particularly
fond
of
them
i
prefer
pigs
and
chickens
miss
carson
and
aunt
harriet
had
also
been
going
the
round
of
the
farm
and
came
up
to
inspect
the
hives
miss
beach
was
greatly
interested
in
her
friend
work
and
full
of
congratulations
such
women
as
you
are
the
backbone
of
the
country
she
declared
the
next
best
thing
to
fighting
is
to
provide
food
for
the
nation
england
is
capable
of
producing
twice
her
annual
yield
if
there
is
proper
organization
i
a
great
advocate
of
small
holdings
and
i
think
women
ca
show
their
patriotism
better
than
by
going
to
the
land
you
and
your
students
are
indeed
your
bit
you
make
me
want
to
come
and
help
you
it
was
such
a
delicious
warm
afternoon
that
chairs
were
carried
outside
and
they
had
tea
in
the
garden
under
a
gorgeous
almond
tree
with
the
perfume
of
wallflowers
and
sweet
scented
stocks
wafted
from
the
rockery
above
two
cats
and
a
dog
joined
the
party
also
an
impudent
bantam
cock
who
being
considered
the
mascot
of
the
establishment
was
much
petted
and
allowed
certain
privileges
he
would
sit
on
miss
carson
wrist
like
a
little
tame
hawk
and
she
sometimes
brought
him
into
the
garden
at
to
give
him
at
all
the
fowls
and
chickens
were
fed
a
tremendous
business
at
which
winona
looked
on
with
enthusiasm
she
admired
the
systematic
way
in
which
the
food
was
measured
and
distributed
so
that
each
individual
member
of
the
flock
received
its
due
share
and
was
not
robbed
by
a
greedier
and
stronger
neighbor
she
was
very
reluctant
to
leave
when
miss
beach
at
last
brought
round
the
car
how
i
love
to
go
and
learn
farming
when
i
leave
school
she
ventured
to
remark
as
they
drove
home
it
needs
brains
returned
aunt
harriet
rather
snappily
you
imagine
it
all
tea
in
the
garden
and
playing
with
fluffy
chickens
to
run
such
a
holding
intelligently
requires
a
clever
capable
head
your
examination
quite
enough
for
you
to
think
about
at
present
if
to
have
any
chance
at
all
of
passing
it
will
take
your
whole
energies
i
assure
you
winona
duly
snubbed
held
her
peace
chapter
xviii
a
friend
in
need
under
the
coaching
of
miss
goodson
the
sixth
form
had
settled
down
to
grim
work
twelve
girls
were
to
present
themselves
for
examination
for
entering
dunningham
university
and
though
the
teacher
naturally
concentrated
her
greatest
energies
on
this
elect
dozen
the
rest
by
no
means
slipped
through
her
intellectual
net
there
were
stars
among
the
candidates
of
whom
she
might
feel
moderately
certain
and
there
were
also
laggers
whose
success
was
doubtful
in
this
latter
category
she
classed
winona
poor
winona
still
floundered
rather
hopelessly
in
some
of
her
subjects
a
poetic
imagination
may
be
a
delightful
inheritance
and
a
source
of
infinite
enjoyment
to
its
owner
but
it
does
not
supply
the
place
of
a
good
memory
examiners
are
prosaic
beings
who
require
solid
facts
and
even
the
style
of
a
macaulay
or
a
carlyle
would
not
satisfy
them
unless
accompanied
by
definite
answers
to
their
set
questions
by
a
piece
of
unparalleled
luck
winona
had
secured
and
retained
her
county
scholarship
but
her
powers
of
essay
writing
were
not
likely
to
serve
her
in
such
good
stead
again
she
often
groaned
when
she
thought
of
the
examinations
miss
bishop
aunt
harriet
and
her
mother
would
all
be
so
disappointed
if
she
failed
and
alas
her
failure
seemed
only
too
probable
miss
goodson
does
tell
me
plump
out
that
i
be
plucked
but
i
can
see
she
thinks
so
confided
winona
to
garnet
one
day
then
show
her
she
is
wrong
not
much
chance
of
that
i
afraid
but
i
doing
my
level
best
i
get
up
at
six
every
morning
and
slave
before
breakfast
so
do
i
but
i
get
such
frightful
headaches
sighed
garnet
i
been
nearly
mad
with
them
my
cousin
took
me
to
the
doctor
yesterday
he
says
it
my
eyes
i
sha
be
at
school
i
have
to
go
to
dunningham
to
see
a
specialist
poor
old
girl
you
never
told
me
about
your
headaches
you
never
asked
me
i
seen
so
little
of
you
lately
winona
conscience
smote
her
she
had
rather
neglected
garnet
since
they
had
entered
the
sixth
form
during
their
year
in
they
had
been
fast
friends
as
new
girls
together
and
scholarship
holders
a
close
tie
had
existed
between
them
and
they
had
shared
in
many
small
excitements
and
adventures
when
winona
was
chosen
games
captain
however
their
interests
seemed
to
separate
garnet
was
not
athletic
she
cared
little
for
hockey
or
cricket
and
preferred
to
devote
her
surplus
energies
to
the
literary
society
or
the
debating
club
almost
inevitably
they
had
drifted
apart
winona
wrapped
up
in
the
supreme
fascinations
of
hockey
matches
and
gymnasium
practice
had
chummed
with
marjorie
kemp
bessie
kirk
and
joyce
newton
who
shared
her
enthusiasm
for
games
she
remembered
with
a
pang
of
that
she
had
not
walked
round
the
playground
with
garnet
once
this
term
winona
admired
fidelity
but
she
certainly
could
not
pride
herself
upon
having
practiced
that
virtue
of
late
garnet
was
absent
from
her
desk
next
day
but
when
she
returned
to
the
school
on
thursday
winona
sought
an
opportunity
and
bore
her
off
for
a
private
talk
garnet
was
looking
very
pale
i
dreadfully
upset
she
confessed
i
told
you
i
had
to
see
a
specialist
about
my
eyes
well
yesterday
we
went
to
dunningham
to
consult
sir
alfred
pollard
he
says
there
very
serious
trouble
and
that
if
i
not
careful
i
may
ruin
my
sight
altogether
he
absolutely
forbids
any
home
work
in
the
evenings
forbids
home
work
gasped
winona
yes
utterly
just
think
of
it
with
the
examinations
only
six
weeks
off
i
begged
and
implored
but
he
said
i
might
choose
between
my
sight
and
my
exam
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
fail
oh
garnet
yes
continued
her
friend
bitterly
to
fail
at
the
very
end
after
all
my
work
and
i
worked
when
other
girls
have
been
getting
all
sorts
of
fun
i
sat
in
my
bedroom
with
my
books
oh
it
too
cruel
do
think
me
conceited
but
i
thought
i
might
have
a
chance
for
the
seaton
scholarship
it
was
worth
trying
for
if
you
knew
how
i
long
to
go
to
college
it
would
be
so
glorious
to
write
after
name
besides
i
must
do
something
in
life
all
my
sisters
have
chosen
careers
and
i
had
quite
decided
to
take
up
teaching
as
a
profession
i
talked
it
over
with
miss
goodson
one
day
she
was
so
nice
about
it
and
strongly
advised
me
to
go
to
college
if
i
could
possibly
get
the
opportunity
well
i
suppose
that
dream
over
now
not
much
chance
of
a
scholarship
with
one
prep
knocked
off
oh
garnet
i
so
sorry
will
the
doctor
let
you
take
the
exams
at
all
yes
i
may
attend
school
as
usual
and
go
in
for
the
but
i
not
to
look
at
a
book
after
or
before
so
it
a
very
empty
permission
how
i
shall
rage
all
the
evenings
i
wish
i
had
a
gramophone
to
howl
out
my
work
into
my
ears
as
i
may
use
my
eyes
would
that
help
you
asked
winona
eagerly
of
course
it
would
it
is
my
brain
that
wrong
only
my
eyes
i
asked
my
cousin
to
read
my
prep
to
me
one
evening
but
it
was
beyond
her
and
we
only
got
into
a
muddle
oh
dear
i
could
cry
to
have
worked
to
within
six
weeks
of
the
and
then
to
have
to
slack
like
this
i
the
unluckiest
girl
in
the
world
winona
comforted
her
poor
friend
as
best
she
could
she
had
an
idea
at
the
back
of
her
mind
but
she
did
not
venture
to
confide
it
to
garnet
until
she
had
first
consulted
aunt
harriet
about
it
it
was
no
less
a
proposal
than
that
they
should
do
their
preparation
together
and
that
by
reading
the
work
aloud
she
could
act
eyes
for
her
chum
it
would
be
difficult
no
doubt
but
not
an
utter
impossibility
and
it
was
absolutely
the
only
way
in
which
garnet
could
receive
help
it
would
necessitate
their
spending
many
hours
daily
in
each
other
company
and
to
arrange
this
seemed
to
be
the
difficulty
she
explained
the
situation
to
miss
beach
with
some
diffidence
and
hesitation
she
was
terribly
afraid
of
receiving
a
snubbing
and
being
told
that
her
own
work
was
more
than
sufficient
for
her
without
taking
up
her
friend
burdens
to
her
surprise
however
aunt
harriet
proved
sympathetic
and
heartily
acquiesced
in
the
scheme
she
indeed
made
the
very
kind
proposal
that
for
the
six
weeks
until
the
exam
garnet
should
sleep
with
winona
at
abbey
close
so
that
they
might
have
both
the
evening
and
early
morning
preparation
together
winona
carried
her
friend
to
a
quiet
corner
of
the
gymnasium
to
communicate
her
thrilling
news
win
you
do
really
mean
it
oh
you
big
i
did
think
any
one
in
the
world
would
have
done
that
for
me
do
you
realize
what
undertaking
it
the
one
thing
that
can
save
me
and
only
a
girl
in
my
own
form
and
going
in
for
the
exams
herself
could
do
it
nobody
else
understands
exactly
what
one
wants
win
i
ready
to
worship
you
will
your
cousin
let
you
come
to
stay
with
us
i
no
fear
of
that
she
be
as
grateful
to
you
as
i
am
without
any
further
loss
of
time
garnet
was
installed
at
abbey
close
and
the
friends
began
their
joint
preparation
garnet
by
the
orders
sat
with
a
black
silk
handkerchief
tied
over
her
eyes
so
as
to
give
them
all
the
rest
which
was
possible
her
brain
was
very
alert
however
and
her
excellent
memory
retained
most
of
what
winona
read
to
her
at
first
there
were
many
difficulties
to
be
overcome
for
each
had
had
her
own
way
of
studying
but
after
a
while
they
grew
used
to
their
united
method
and
began
to
make
headway
with
the
work
they
thoroughly
enjoyed
being
together
to
winona
it
was
almost
like
being
back
at
the
hostel
to
have
a
companion
in
her
bedroom
and
her
many
jokes
and
bits
of
fun
kept
up
garnet
spirits
they
set
their
alarm
clock
for
and
began
study
promptly
at
six
each
morning
after
eating
the
bread
and
butter
and
drinking
the
glasses
of
milk
which
by
aunt
harriet
orders
were
always
placed
in
readiness
for
them
these
early
hours
when
the
day
was
cool
and
a
fresh
breeze
blew
in
through
the
open
window
seemed
the
most
valuable
of
all
their
brains
felt
clearer
and
they
were
often
able
to
grasp
problems
and
difficult
points
which
had
eluded
them
the
evening
before
except
for
the
ordinary
practices
which
formed
part
of
the
school
curriculum
winona
was
obliged
for
the
present
to
appoint
bessie
kirk
as
her
she
had
no
time
herself
to
train
juniors
to
act
referee
or
to
stand
watching
tennis
sets
it
meant
a
great
sacrifice
to
relinquish
these
most
congenial
duties
but
she
knew
miss
bishop
and
miss
goodson
approved
and
she
promised
herself
to
return
to
them
all
the
more
heartily
when
the
examination
should
be
over
she
would
ask
bessie
wistfully
for
reports
of
the
progress
of
various
stars
who
were
in
training
and
managed
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
games
though
she
could
not
always
participate
in
them
wait
till
june
over
and
i
emancipated
then
wo
i
have
the
time
of
my
life
she
announced
thank
goodness
the
match
with
binworth
is
till
july
the
weeks
of
strenuous
work
passed
slowly
by
the
weather
was
warm
and
sultry
with
frequent
thunderstorms
not
a
favorable
atmosphere
for
study
garnet
flagged
palpably
and
lost
her
roses
to
winona
the
time
seemed
interminable
the
task
she
had
undertaken
of
helping
her
friend
was
a
formidable
one
it
needed
all
her
courage
to
persevere
sometimes
she
longed
just
for
an
evening
to
throw
it
up
and
go
and
play
tennis
instead
but
every
hour
was
important
to
garnet
and
must
not
be
lost
winona
often
had
to
set
her
teeth
and
force
herself
to
resist
the
alluring
sound
of
the
tennis
in
the
garden
where
she
had
a
standing
invitation
to
come
and
play
and
it
took
all
the
will
power
of
which
she
was
capable
to
focus
her
attention
on
the
examination
subjects
she
tried
not
to
let
garnet
see
how
much
the
effort
cost
her
the
latter
was
sensitive
and
painfully
conscious
of
being
a
burden
miss
beach
dosed
both
the
girls
with
tonics
and
insisted
upon
their
taking
a
certain
amount
of
exercise
work
by
all
means
but
do
was
her
recommendation
there
such
a
thing
as
bending
a
bow
until
it
breaks
i
do
like
to
see
such
white
cheeks
the
examination
was
for
entering
dunningham
university
and
must
be
taken
at
that
city
the
governors
of
the
seaton
high
school
had
offered
a
scholarship
tenable
for
three
years
to
whichever
of
their
candidates
obtaining
first
class
honors
appeared
highest
on
the
list
of
passes
they
had
arranged
with
the
examiners
to
place
the
names
of
the
successful
candidates
in
order
of
merit
and
on
the
receipt
of
the
results
they
would
award
their
exhibition
if
no
one
obtained
first
class
honors
the
offer
would
be
withdrawn
and
held
over
until
another
year
several
of
the
girls
were
well
up
in
their
work
and
seemed
likely
to
have
a
chance
of
winning
linda
fletcher
had
the
advantage
of
two
years
in
the
sixth
agatha
james
was
undoubtedly
clever
and
beatrice
howell
though
not
brilliant
possessed
a
steady
capacity
for
grind
with
three
such
formidable
rivals
garnet
heart
might
very
reasonably
fail
her
the
doctor
prohibition
was
a
most
serious
handicap
for
invaluable
as
her
chum
help
proved
it
was
not
so
effective
as
being
able
to
use
her
own
eyes
sometimes
she
lost
courage
altogether
and
it
needed
most
dogged
determination
to
keep
her
mind
fixed
unwaveringly
upon
the
end
in
view
it
like
playing
in
a
match
winona
assured
her
if
you
think
the
other
side
going
to
win
you
may
as
well
throw
up
the
sponge
at
once
do
give
way
an
inch
until
you
absolutely
know
you
beaten
i
just
determined
you
to
have
that
scholarship
if
i
could
only
think
so
sighed
garnet
oh
win
what
should
i
do
without
you
when
i
with
you
my
spirits
go
up
and
i
courage
enough
for
anything
and
when
i
by
myself
i
feel
a
wretched
of
a
creature
just
inclined
to
sit
in
a
corner
and
blub
no
blubbering
please
worst
thing
possible
for
the
eyes
commanded
winona
well
i
wo
you
cheered
me
up
tremendously
i
glad
you
be
in
the
exam
room
with
me
i
shall
feel
twice
as
brave
if
i
know
there
the
days
sped
on
and
the
very
last
one
came
miss
bishop
and
miss
goodson
had
given
their
final
coachings
and
their
most
valuable
help
winona
and
garnet
devoted
the
evening
to
mastering
one
or
two
doubtful
points
we
done
our
best
and
it
depends
now
whether
we
luck
in
the
questions
said
winona
i
think
we
better
put
the
books
away
we
shall
only
muddle
ourselves
if
we
try
any
more
aunt
harriet
says
we
not
to
get
up
at
five
we
shall
have
quite
a
hard
enough
day
as
it
is
it
would
be
much
use
said
garnet
thrusting
back
the
hair
from
her
hot
forehead
i
feel
i
taken
in
the
utmost
my
brains
can
hold
there
no
room
for
anything
more
how
close
the
air
is
i
believe
we
going
to
have
another
storm
replied
winona
leaning
out
of
the
widely
opened
window
to
gaze
at
the
lurid
sky
there
a
feeling
of
electricity
about
ah
there
it
begins
a
vivid
flash
behind
the
tower
of
the
old
minster
was
followed
by
a
long
rumble
of
thunder
the
atmosphere
was
painfully
oppressive
again
a
white
streak
ran
like
a
corkscrew
over
the
clouds
and
a
louder
peal
resounded
the
storm
was
drawing
nearer
come
from
the
window
winona
it
not
safe
garnet
was
terribly
afraid
of
thunder
the
electricity
in
the
air
has
a
powerful
effect
upon
some
temperaments
and
at
the
first
sound
of
heaven
artillery
she
was
crouching
beside
her
bed
with
her
head
buried
in
the
pillow
do
be
a
silly
ostrich
retorted
her
chum
it
quite
far
away
yet
and
if
it
does
come
the
chances
are
a
thousand
to
one
against
it
hitting
this
particular
house
why
you
were
half
so
scared
of
zeppelins
for
goodness
sake
do
get
hysterical
show
some
pluck
winona
remarks
might
not
be
complimentary
but
they
were
bracing
garnet
laughed
nervously
and
consented
to
sit
upon
a
chair
in
about
the
storm
blew
over
leaving
a
clear
sky
and
stars
come
and
put
your
head
out
of
the
window
and
feel
how
deliciously
fresh
and
cool
it
is
commanded
winona
look
at
that
bright
planet
i
think
it
must
be
jupiter
i
take
it
as
a
good
omen
for
the
storm
will
have
cleared
your
brain
and
your
star
in
the
ascendant
here
luck
to
the
the
city
of
dunningham
was
about
thirty
miles
away
from
seaton
it
was
a
big
manufacturing
city
with
a
highly
flourishing
modern
university
which
had
lately
come
much
to
the
fore
and
had
begun
to
make
itself
a
reputation
the
three
days
examination
was
to
be
held
in
the
university
buildings
and
all
candidates
were
bound
to
present
themselves
there
miss
bishop
had
decided
that
the
contingent
of
twelve
from
the
seaton
high
school
should
travel
to
dunningham
each
morning
by
the
early
express
under
the
charge
of
miss
lever
who
would
take
them
out
for
lunch
and
escort
them
safely
back
to
seaton
again
in
the
evening
the
arrangement
necessitated
an
early
start
but
nobody
minded
that
the
little
party
met
at
the
railway
station
in
quite
bright
spirits
it
was
rather
fun
all
going
to
dunningham
together
and
having
a
special
compartment
engaged
for
them
on
the
train
it
was
a
difficult
matter
for
thirteen
people
to
cram
into
seats
only
intended
for
the
accommodation
of
ten
but
they
preferred
to
separation
and
cheerfully
took
it
in
turns
to
sit
on
one
another
knees
it
more
like
a
beanfeast
than
the
laughed
mary
payne
handing
round
a
packet
of
chocolates
i
feel
i
absolutely
do
care
i
feel
like
a
criminal
on
the
road
to
execution
groaned
helena
maitland
used
they
to
give
the
poor
wretches
anything
they
asked
for
oh
yes
thanks
i
have
a
chocolate
by
all
means
but
crowning
the
victim
with
a
garland
of
roses
rather
mixed
metaphors
my
child
if
you
do
express
yourself
more
clearly
in
your
papers
i
afraid
you
wo
satisfy
the
examiners
i
wonder
who
corrects
the
papers
asked
freda
long
oh
some
snarling
old
probably
who
anxious
to
get
through
the
job
as
quickly
as
he
can
it
must
be
a
withering
experience
to
go
through
thousands
of
papers
enough
to
pulverize
your
brains
for
the
rest
of
your
life
i
do
mind
the
examiners
brains
it
my
own
i
anxious
about
if
they
last
me
out
these
three
days
i
be
content
to
exist
at
a
very
low
mental
level
afterwards
right
you
are
ditto
this
child
i
going
to
read
nothing
but
the
trashiest
novels
during
the
holidays
announced
mary
aggressively
and
i
not
going
to
read
at
all
i
shall
just
lounge
and
play
tennis
added
hilda
poor
dears
i
used
to
feel
like
that
but
one
gets
over
it
smiled
miss
lever
do
eat
too
many
caramels
or
you
be
so
thirsty
in
the
exam
room
malted
milk
tablets
are
the
best
thing
they
sweet
but
sustaining
plain
chocolate
is
the
next
best
i
shall
think
of
you
all
the
whole
morning
you
have
a
lovely
time
gallivanting
round
dunningham
and
while
we
racking
our
brains
said
garnet
we
all
envious
remember
i
had
my
purgatory
before
returned
miss
lever
laughing
you
must
allow
me
a
good
time
in
my
old
age
arrived
at
dunningham
station
they
took
the
tramcar
and
proceeded
straight
to
the
university
it
was
a
very
fine
modern
building
erected
round
three
sides
of
a
large
quadrangle
the
fourth
side
being
occupied
by
a
museum
they
were
directed
to
the
women
students
department
and
took
off
their
hats
and
coats
in
the
miss
lever
who
had
herself
graduated
at
dunningham
knew
the
place
well
and
was
able
to
give
them
exact
directions
she
escorted
them
across
the
quadrangle
to
the
big
hall
where
the
examination
was
to
be
held
the
place
has
a
classic
look
said
garnet
gazing
at
the
corinthian
columns
of
the
portico
i
afraid
they
wo
consider
my
latin
up
to
standard
may
the
fates
send
me
an
easy
paper
you
should
have
asked
them
before
giggled
winona
the
papers
are
printed
now
and
not
all
the
gods
of
olympus
could
alter
a
letter
i
accept
my
fortunes
in
the
spirit
of
a
mahomedan
it
kismet
the
first
set
of
questions
was
easier
than
the
girls
had
dared
to
expect
they
scribbled
away
eagerly
it
was
encouraging
at
any
rate
to
make
a
good
beginning
they
compared
notes
at
the
end
of
the
morning
and
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
all
had
done
fairly
well
miss
lever
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
quadrangle
when
they
came
out
and
announced
that
she
had
engaged
a
special
table
for
the
party
at
a
restaurant
and
had
ordered
a
particularly
nice
little
lunch
with
coffee
afterwards
to
clear
their
brains
some
of
the
girls
were
tired
and
inclined
to
groan
others
were
exhilarated
but
the
enthusiasts
cheered
up
the
weaker
spirits
and
by
the
time
the
coffee
course
was
reached
everybody
was
feeling
courageous
should
i
dare
to
suggest
ices
murmured
winona
all
right
if
you
like
there
just
time
assented
miss
lever
consulting
her
watch
i
passed
my
intermediate
on
ices
during
a
spell
of
intensely
hot
weather
i
can
allow
you
exactly
five
minutes
so
choose
quickly
strawberry
or
vanilla
the
three
days
of
the
examination
seemed
to
winona
like
a
dream
she
grew
quite
accustomed
to
the
big
hall
full
of
candidates
and
to
her
particular
desk
garnet
sat
at
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
and
winona
would
sometimes
pause
a
moment
to
watch
her
to
judge
from
her
absorbed
appearance
and
fast
moving
pen
the
papers
appeared
to
suit
her
to
winona
immense
astonishment
she
herself
was
doing
quite
moderately
well
the
six
weeks
coaching
of
garnet
had
been
of
inestimable
benefit
to
her
own
work
she
had
not
then
thought
of
this
aspect
of
the
matter
but
she
was
certainly
now
reaping
the
reward
of
her
labor
of
love
for
the
first
time
the
possibility
of
gaining
a
pass
occurred
to
her
if
i
do
it
be
the
limit
she
reflected
miss
bishop
will
have
about
the
surprise
of
her
life
on
the
whole
the
girls
quite
enjoyed
their
three
days
at
dunningham
there
were
intervals
between
their
various
papers
which
they
spent
partly
in
the
university
museum
and
partly
in
the
city
art
gallery
where
a
fine
collection
of
old
masters
was
on
loan
it
was
the
first
time
winona
had
seen
paintings
by
artists
though
she
had
often
pored
over
reproductions
of
their
works
in
or
she
felt
that
the
experience
added
another
window
to
her
outlook
on
life
i
wish
i
the
talent
to
be
an
artist
she
thought
there
are
so
many
things
i
like
to
do
oh
dear
painting
and
music
both
beyond
me
utterly
and
physical
culture
and
poultry
farming
and
red
cross
nursing
and
i
probably
sha
do
any
of
them
after
all
i
want
to
be
of
solid
use
to
the
world
in
a
nice
interesting
way
to
myself
and
i
expect
i
just
have
to
do
a
lot
of
stupid
things
that
i
hate
why
was
i
born
a
raphael
how
do
you
think
you
got
on
altogether
garnet
asked
winona
as
thoroughly
tired
out
the
two
girls
traveled
homeward
to
seaton
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
examination
um
tolerably
better
perhaps
than
i
expected
but
that
not
saying
much
and
you
i
never
prophesy
till
i
know
but
garnet
dark
eyes
shone
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
corner
chapter

the
swimming
contest
once
the
examinations
were
over
winona
spirits
which
had
been
decidedly
at
il
penseroso
went
up
to
the
strain
of
coaching
garnet
had
been
very
great
but
the
relief
was
in
corresponding
proportion
she
felt
as
if
a
burden
had
rolled
from
her
shoulders
there
was
just
a
month
of
the
term
left
the
sixth
would
of
course
be
expected
to
do
its
ordinary
form
work
but
the
amount
of
home
study
required
would
be
reasonable
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
intolerable
grind
of
preparation
for
a
university
examination
the
extra
afternoon
classes
with
miss
goodson
were
no
longer
necessary
leaving
a
delightful
period
of
leisure
at
school
winona
intended
to
employ
these
blissful
intervals
in
cricket
practice
at
the
tennis
courts
in
helping
to
arrange
the
museum
and
in
carrying
out
several
other
pet
schemes
that
she
had
been
forced
hitherto
to
set
aside
bessie
kirk
had
made
a
good
deputy
but
it
was
nice
to
take
the
reins
into
her
own
hands
once
more
and
feel
that
she
was
head
of
the
games
department
she
coached
her
champions
assiduously
at
tennis
emily
cooper
and
bertha
march
stood
out
like
planets
among
the
stars
they
had
already
beaten
westwood
high
school
and
hill
top
secondary
school
and
hoped
to
have
a
chance
against
binworth
college
of
hitherto
invincible
reputation
the
match
would
not
take
place
for
a
fortnight
which
gave
extra
time
for
practice
in
cricket
betty
carlisle
had
come
to
the
front
at
bowling
while
maggie
allesley
and
irene
swinburne
were
heroines
of
the
bat
it
is
inevitable
that
some
girls
should
overtop
the
rest
but
winona
would
not
on
that
account
allow
the
others
to
slack
she
knew
the
importance
of
a
high
general
average
of
play
and
urged
on
several
laggers
she
thoroughly
realized
the
importance
of
fielding
and
made
her
eleven
concentrate
their
minds
upon
it
we
lost
tamley
on
fielding
she
affirmed
and
if
we
any
intention
of
beating
binworth
we
just
got
to
practice
catching
and
throwing
in
of
the
two
matches
in
which
the
school
had
so
far
taken
part
the
first
with
baddeley
high
school
had
been
a
draw
and
in
the
second
with
tamley
they
had
been
beaten
it
was
not
an
encouraging
record
and
winona
felt
that
for
the
credit
of
the
school
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
vanquish
binworth
its
team
had
a
fairly
good
reputation
so
it
would
be
no
easy
task
but
after
the
hockey
successes
of
last
winter
she
did
not
despair
apart
from
school
she
had
a
very
pleasant
time
nearly
every
evening
after
supper
aunt
harriet
would
suggest
a
short
run
in
the
car
before
sunset
she
generally
allowed
her
niece
to
take
the
wheel
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
town
traffic
and
winona
soon
became
quite
expert
at
driving
she
liked
to
feel
the
little
car
answering
to
her
guidance
there
was
a
thrill
in
rounding
corners
and
steering
past
carts
and
every
time
she
went
out
she
gained
fresh
confidence
she
was
not
at
all
nervous
and
kept
her
head
admirably
in
several
small
emergencies
managing
so
well
that
aunt
harriet
finally
allowed
her
to
bring
the
car
back
down
the
high
street
which
as
it
was
the
most
crowded
portion
of
the
town
was
considered
the
ordeal
in
seaton
she
acquitted
herself
with
great
credit
passed
a
tramcar
successfully
and
understood
the
signals
of
the
policeman
who
waved
his
hand
at
the
corner
aunt
harriet
had
taken
out
a
license
for
her
so
having
proved
her
skill
in
the
high
street
she
now
felt
quite
a
lady
chauffeur
winona
immensely
enjoyed
these
evening
runs
when
the
sky
was
aflame
with
sunset
and
the
trees
were
quiet
dark
masses
of
color
and
the
long
road
stretched
out
before
her
pink
from
the
glow
above
and
the
lacey
hemlocks
and
meadowsweets
made
a
soft
blurred
border
below
the
hedgerows
with
an
open
road
in
front
of
her
she
was
tempted
sometimes
to
put
on
speed
and
felt
as
if
she
were
flying
onwards
into
a
dream
country
where
all
was
vague
and
mysterious
and
shadowy
and
unknown
she
was
always
loth
to
return
but
aunt
harriet
was
extremely
particular
that
they
must
be
home
before
time
and
would
point
remorselessly
to
the
small
clock
that
hung
facing
the
seat
perhaps
winona
greatest
triumph
was
when
one
evening
she
managed
without
any
assistance
to
run
the
car
into
its
own
shed
in
the
garage
a
delicate
little
piece
of
steering
which
required
fine
calculation
a
quick
hand
and
a
rapid
turn
she
was
learning
something
of
the
mechanism
too
could
refill
the
petrol
tank
and
was
almost
anxious
for
a
tire
to
burst
so
that
she
might
have
the
opportunity
of
putting
on
the
stepney
wheel
though
this
latter
ambition
was
not
shared
by
her
aunt
when
all
the
men
have
gone
to
the
war
i
be
able
to
drive
a
taxi
or
a
war
van
and
make
myself
useful
to
the
government
i
believe
i
could
clean
the
car
perfectly
well
if
sam
should
be
called
up
and
has
to
leave
the
garage
i
just
enjoy
turning
the
hose
on
it
what
would
they
give
me
a
week
to
take
sam
place
here
they
give
you
a
snubbing
if
you
asked
them
laughed
aunt
harriet
cleaning
a
car
is
uncommonly
hard
work
you
might
manage
our
small
one
but
by
the
time
you
done
the
whole
round
of
the
garage
you
be
ready
to
declare
it
was
a
woman
job
i
chance
it
retorted
winona
she
had
her
opportunity
after
all
for
the
garage
attendant
was
taken
ill
and
remained
off
duty
for
several
days
on
the
saturday
morning
winona
set
to
work
and
cleaned
polished
and
oiled
the
car
thoroughly
it
was
very
dirty
after
a
muddy
day
use
so
she
had
her
full
experience
it
was
certainly
far
harder
than
she
had
anticipated
and
she
felt
devoutly
thankful
that
she
was
not
bound
to
attack
the
cars
in
the
other
sheds
and
perform
similar
services
for
each
sam
earns
his
money
she
assured
aunt
harriet
when
she
returned
at
on
the
whole
i
decided
i
wo
be
a
lady
chauffeur
it
bad
enough
to
have
to
clean
one
bicycle
but
if
i
had
to
go
through
this
car
performance
every
day
i
do
think
there
be
very
much
left
of
me
ah
i
told
you
so
returned
aunt
harriet
triumphantly
motoring
was
not
the
only
fresh
form
of
activity
which
winona
had
taken
up
this
summer
the
school
had
organized
swimming
classes
and
on
certain
days
detachments
of
girls
were
conducted
to
the
public
baths
owing
to
her
college
entrance
examinations
winona
had
not
been
able
to
attend
the
full
course
but
she
had
learnt
to
swim
last
summer
at
the
baths
and
was
as
enthusiastic
as
anybody
miss
medland
the
teacher
was
an
expert
from
dunningham
she
was
skillful
herself
and
clever
at
training
her
pupils
the
girls
soon
gained
confidence
in
the
water
and
began
to
be
able
to
perform
what
they
called
mermaid
high
jinks
the
public
baths
at
seaton
were
most
remarkably
good
so
good
indeed
that
many
of
the
citizens
had
raised
a
protest
against
the
corporation
for
spending
so
much
money
upon
them
the
high
school
girls
who
had
not
to
pay
the
rates
did
not
sympathize
with
the
grumbles
of
ratepayers
and
rejoiced
exceedingly
in
the
sumptuous
accommodation
they
specially
appreciated
the
comfort
of
the
and
the
convenience
of
the
apparatus
for
drying
their
hair
the
restaurant
where
tea
or
bovril
could
be
had
was
also
a
luxury
for
those
who
were
apt
to
turn
shivery
after
coming
from
the
water
i
can
understand
why
the
romans
were
so
enthusiastic
about
their
public
baths
said
audrey
redfern
just
think
of
having
little
trays
of
eatables
floating
about
on
the
water
so
that
you
could
have
a
snack
whenever
you
wanted
and
slaves
to
bring
you
delicious
scent
afterwards
and
garlands
of
flowers
i
wish
i
lived
some
time
instead
of
in
the
twentieth
century
be
thankful
you
did
live
in
the
twelfth
for
then
you
might
have
had
a
bath
at
all
returned
winona
certainly
not
a
public
one
and
probably
not
the
private
one
either
an
occasional
canful
of
water
would
have
been
thought
quite
sufficient
for
you
with
perhaps
a
dip
in
a
stream
if
you
could
get
it
the
people
who
bathed
were
mostly
pilgrims
at
holy
wells
and
they
all
used
the
same
water
no
matter
what
their
diseases
were
how
disgusting
well
on
the
whole
i
tolerably
satisfied
to
belong
to
the
poor
old
twentieth
century
it
might
be
better
but
it
might
be
worse
how
kind
of
you
i
sure
posterity
will
be
grateful
for
your
approval
want
me
to
push
you
into
the
water
winona
woodward
i
will
in
half
a
second
at
the
end
of
the
course
it
was
arranged
that
a
swimming
contest
should
take
place
among
the
girls
and
that
various
prizes
should
be
offered
for
championships
it
was
the
first
event
of
the
kind
in
the
annals
of
the
school
so
naturally
it
aroused
much
enthusiasm
about
thirty
candidates
were
selected
by
miss
medland
as
eligible
for
competitions
the
rest
of
her
pupils
having
to
content
themselves
with
looking
on
a
special
afternoon
was
given
up
to
the
display
and
invitations
were
sent
out
to
parents
to
come
and
help
to
swell
the
audience
are
you
in
for
the
mermaidens
fête
winona
asked
marjorie
kemp
mermaidens
fête
indeed
how
romantic
we
are
all
of
a
sudden
the
frog
fight
i
should
call
it
there
speaks
the
voice
of
envy
you
evidently
out
of
it
do
want
to
be
in
it
thanks
it
be
wretched
work
shivering
round
the
edge
of
the
bath
for
a
solid
hour
sour
grapes
my
child
teased
winona
go
on
my
good
girl
if
you
want
to
make
me
raggy
you
just
succeed
that
all
now
i
like
to
have
been
chosen
mourned
evelyn
richards
i
do
mind
confessing
that
i
had
a
disappointment
i
thought
i
could
swim
quite
as
well
as
freda
and
it
grizzly
hard
luck
that
she
was
picked
out
and
i
was
rank
favoritism
i
call
it
poor
old
eve
look
here
i
tell
you
a
secret
you
head
the
reserve
list
i
know
because
i
saw
it
if
anybody
has
a
cold
on
the
day
of
the
event
you
take
her
place
you
mascot
shall
i
oh
i
do
hope
somebody
catch
cold
not
badly
but
just
enough
to
make
it
unsafe
to
go
into
the
water
you
ca
think
how
i
want
to
try
my
luck
i
do
suppose
i
a
chance
of
a
prize
but
if
i
did
get
one
why
i
the
school
down
i
quite
sure
you
would
trust
you
to
blow
your
own
trumpet
winona
woodward
if
you
been
properly
and
thoroughly
spanked
in
your
babyhood
you
be
a
much
more
civil
person
now
i
decline
your
company
poor
old
eve
take
it
sporting
said
winona
soothingly
on
the
afternoon
of
the
great
event
the
ladies
large
bath
was
specially
reserved
for
the
school
a
goodly
crowd
of
spectators
filled
almost
to
overflowing
the
galleries
that
ran
round
the
hall
interested
fathers
and
mothers
sympathetic
aunts
and
a
sprinkling
of
cousins
and
friends
made
up
the
visitors
list
and
the
rest
of
the
space
was
crammed
with
school
girls
each
likely
champion
had
her
own
set
of
supporters
who
murmured
her
name
as
a
kind
of
war
cry
and
were
only
restrained
from
shouting
it
at
the
pitch
of
their
lungs
by
the
sight
of
miss
bishop
who
stood
below
talking
to
miss
medland
and
the
judge
the
enthusiasm
went
perhaps
more
by
favor
than
by
actual
prowess
and
could
hardly
be
taken
as
an
augury
of
success
for
barbara
jones
who
was
popular
received
much
more
encouragement
than
olga
dickinson
who
had
distanced
her
every
time
at
the
practices
juniors
will
be
juniors
however
and
the
fourth
and
third
forms
stamped
solidly
for
barbara
ignoring
the
superior
claims
of
her
rival
the
bath
with
its
blue
and
white
tiles
looked
tempting
all
the
school
envied
the
candidates
as
they
came
marching
in
in
their
costumes
evelyn
got
a
place
after
all
said
garnet
who
was
among
the
spectators
to
gladys
cooper
who
sat
next
to
her
some
one
else
must
be
off
then
who
is
it
freda
long
poor
old
freda
got
toothache
hard
luck
on
her
there
winona
i
do
believe
she
win
but
cheer
her
rather
winona
also
did
not
think
it
likely
that
she
would
win
she
had
only
had
time
for
half
the
lessons
which
put
her
at
a
serious
disadvantage
with
girls
who
had
taken
the
full
course
it
was
unsporting
however
to
go
in
confident
of
defeat
so
she
meant
to
do
her
best
the
first
event
was
the
upper
school
championship
for
the
fastest
swimmer
the
candidates
stood
ready
at
the
edge
of
the
bath
then
at
the
given
signal
they
flung
themselves
into
the
water
and
started
at
first
they
were
fairly
even
but
after
a
dozen
yards
or
so
several
shot
ahead
the
irrepressible
juniors
lost
all
control
in
their
excitement
and
cheered
on
each
as
she
appeared
to
be
gaining
audrey
redfern
no
no
jess
gardner
winona
woodward
elsie
parton
passed
her
no
no
winona
making
up
she
never
do
it
though
it
a
draw
as
a
matter
of
fact
winona
and
elsie
parton
touched
the
winning
tape
at
the
very
identical
moment
it
was
a
great
surprise
for
both
of
them
winona
had
expected
jess
or
audrey
to
be
first
and
never
thought
of
elsie
as
a
possible
champion
elsie
was
in
and
had
not
been
very
long
at
the
school
no
one
had
taken
much
notice
of
her
up
to
now
and
the
girls
were
rather
staggered
at
her
success
they
did
not
even
clap
her
as
she
climbed
up
from
the
bath
the
judge
wrote
down
the
result
and
called
the
next
event
this
was
the
lower
school
championship
and
the
juniors
were
soon
screaming
for
barbara
jones
and
daisy
james
the
latter
had
it
by
a
length
and
walked
away
smiling
to
be
wrapped
up
in
a
towel
by
miss
lever
for
she
was
a
chilly
little
creature
and
apt
to
be
taken
with
fits
of
shivers
if
she
stood
long
out
of
the
water
diving
followed
both
from
the
edge
of
the
bath
and
from
the
diving
board
in
the
senior
division
audrey
and
jess
secured
the
highest
scores
neither
winona
nor
elsie
coming
near
them
winona
was
not
really
very
fond
of
diving
while
elsie
staked
her
all
upon
extreme
speed
the
juniors
did
almost
better
than
their
elders
olga
achievement
quite
carrying
the
enthusiasm
of
the
hall
the
next
competition
was
for
style
the
candidates
swam
first
on
their
sides
then
on
their
backs
and
finally
on
their
backs
moving
their
legs
only
their
arms
being
placed
on
their
hips
the
judge
put
down
marks
for
each
according
to
what
she
considered
their
deserts
until
the
list
should
be
made
up
nobody
knew
who
in
her
expert
opinion
had
done
the
best
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
midnight
race
a
most
important
event
to
which
the
spectators
were
looking
forward
keenly
only
the
best
swimmers
were
allowed
to
take
part
the
other
candidates
had
to
content
themselves
with
watching
the
selected
ten
retired
to
the
and
in
a
few
moments
emerged
each
clad
in
a
long
white
nightdress
and
holding
a
candlestick
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
a
roar
of
applause
rose
from
the
gallery
as
the
figures
formed
into
line
every
girl
placed
her
candlestick
on
the
edge
of
the
bath
and
getting
into
the
water
held
on
to
the
rail
at
attention
when
the
judge
gave
the
signal
each
seized
her
candlestick
and
commenced
to
swim
on
her
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
bath
holding
up
the
candle
in
her
left
hand
it
was
a
feat
that
required
steadiness
and
skill
evelyn
richards
tried
to
hurry
too
fast
and
the
draft
caused
by
her
passage
blew
out
her
flame
mollie
hill
caught
her
foot
in
her
nightdress
and
dropped
her
candle
altogether
jess
gardner
pursued
the
original
method
of
holding
her
candlestick
in
her
teeth
and
using
both
arms
to
swim
there
was
keen
excitement
as
the
candidates
cautiously
worked
their
way
across
each
was
required
to
place
her
candle
for
a
second
on
the
edge
of
the
bath
and
then
to
swim
back
to
the
original
starting
point
only
five
competitors
were
in
the
running
for
the
return
journey
winona
audrey
redfern
elsie
parton
dora
lloyd
a
fourth
form
girl
and
little
olga
dickinson
the
temptation
to
swim
too
fast
was
overwhelming
and
audrey
fell
a
victim
to
it
her
flame
going
out
just
in
the
middle
of
the
bath
olga
dickinson
actually
reached
the
starting
point
the
first
but
winona
and
elsie
parton
were
only
a
second
behind
her
placing
their
candlesticks
down
at
the
very
same
moment
i
wonder
how
the
score
going
said
winona
as
the
seniors
stood
watching
the
junior
handicap
race
i
no
idea
returned
audrey
you
see
we
do
know
what
marks
miss
gatehead
has
given
for
style
and
several
other
things
she
judge
exactly
like
miss
medland
does
it
a
pity
freda
long
out
of
it
what
happened
to
freda
got
toothache
ca
you
see
her
sitting
up
there
in
the
gallery
holding
her
cheek
she
looking
at
you
poor
old
freda
beastly
hard
luck
murmured
winona
waving
a
sympathetic
greeting
to
her
friend
the
midnight
race
had
been
intensely
interesting
but
the
obstacle
race
proved
an
even
greater
excitement
two
thin
planks
of
wood
were
placed
across
the
bath
floating
upon
the
water
the
competitors
started
from
the
deep
end
dived
under
the
first
plank
and
then
scrambled
over
the
second
at
the
shallow
end
were
a
number
of
large
round
each
candidate
had
to
seize
upon
one
of
these
and
seat
herself
in
it
a
most
difficult
feat
of
fine
balancing
for
unless
she
hit
upon
the
exact
center
of
gravity
the
tub
promptly
overturned
and
flung
her
into
the
water
it
was
a
most
competition
candidates
and
spectators
bursting
into
shouts
of
laughter
as
one
after
another
the
girls
gingerly
climbed
into
their
tubs
and
toppled
over
into
the
bath
those
who
managed
at
last
to
preserve
their
equilibrium
were
given
paddles
and
had
to
navigate
themselves
to
the
nearest
plank
where
they
invariably
fell
out
and
were
rescued
and
towed
back
by
attendant
nymphs
told
off
for
the
purpose
nobody
succeeded
in
paddling
to
the
plank
and
back
again
and
the
competition
resolved
itself
into
a
series
of
splashes
squeals
and
bursts
of
mirth
even
stately
miss
bishop
was
laughing
heartily
and
the
girls
in
the
gallery
were
in
a
state
bordering
on
hysteria
at
last
miss
gatehead
called
order
and
the
dripping
candidates
retired
from
their
water
carnival
to
await
the
judging
the
scores
were
rapidly
added
up
and
the
result
was
announced
winona
woodward
and
elsie
parton
equal
they
will
therefore
swim
the
length
of
the
bath
to
decide
the
championship
planks
and
tubs
were
hastily
cleared
away
from
the
field
of
action
and
the
rival
candidates
started
on
their
final
contest
the
sympathies
of
the
gallery
went
strongly
with
winona
the
girls
wanted
their
games
captain
to
win
and
they
cheered
her
vigorously
but
winona
was
tired
elsie
parton
was
lithe
and
active
and
had
made
fast
swimming
her
specialty
winona
did
her
sporting
best
but
by
the
middle
of
the
bath
elsie
had
distanced
her
and
reached
the
winning
post
a
whole
length
ahead
there
was
dead
silence
from
the
girls
in
the
gallery
their
captain
had
failed
and
they
did
not
mean
to
applaud
her
opponent
winona
looking
upwards
saw
the
popular
feeling
in
their
faces
all
her
generous
spirit
rose
in
revolt
she
was
standing
close
to
miss
bishop
miss
gatehead
and
miss
medland
and
therefore
it
was
certainly
a
breach
of
school
etiquette
for
her
to
do
what
she
did
but
acting
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
she
shouted
cheer
you
slackers
three
cheers
for
elsie
parton
and
waving
her
hand
as
a
signal
led
off
the
hurrah
a
very
volume
of
sound
followed
and
the
roof
rang
as
miss
bishop
presented
the
winner
with
the
cup
for
the
championship
thanks
winona
said
elsie
as
the
girls
walked
away
to
the
i
afraid
i
disappointed
the
school
but
i
did
want
to
win
of
course
you
did
and
why
should
you
i
hope
i
can
take
a
beating
in
a
sporting
way
i
think
i
made
them
ashamed
of
themselves
fair
play
and
no
favoritism
is
the
tradition
of
this
school
and
i
mean
to
have
no
nasty
cliquey
feeling
in
it
so
long
as
i
games
captain
or
my
not
winona
woodward
that
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
chapter
xx
the
red
cross
hospital
winona
received
constant
letters
from
percy
in
the
trenches
somewhere
in
france
all
of
course
carefully
censored
they
had
arranged
a
cryptogram
before
he
left
england
however
and
by
its
aid
he
was
able
to
tell
her
the
name
of
the
place
near
which
he
was
fighting
it
was
a
tremendous
excitement
for
her
when
his
letters
arrived
to
fetch
her
key
to
the
cryptogram
and
reckon
out
the
magic
little
word
that
let
her
know
his
whereabouts
she
would
find
the
spot
on
the
big
that
hung
in
the
and
would
mark
it
with
a
miniature
flag
feeling
in
closer
touch
with
him
now
she
knew
exactly
where
he
was
located
she
kept
a
special
album
in
which
she
placed
photos
of
him
in
khaki
all
his
letters
and
postcards
and
any
newspaper
cuttings
that
concerned
his
regiment
the
book
was
already
half
full
she
looked
it
over
almost
daily
and
kept
it
as
at
present
her
greatest
treasure
she
sent
parcels
regularly
to
percy
campaigning
had
not
destroyed
his
boyish
love
for
sweetstuff
and
he
welcomed
cakes
toffee
and
chocolate
i
share
it
with
the
other
chaps
he
wrote
and
they
give
you
a
vote
of
thanks
every
time
you
would
believe
what
larks
we
have
in
our
percy
letters
were
in
his
old
gay
style
but
every
now
and
then
winona
noticed
a
more
serious
vein
running
through
them
he
had
sad
news
to
tell
sometimes
two
of
his
special
chums
were
killed
in
action
the
young
doctor
was
shot
while
attending
to
the
wounded
and
their
chaplain
had
been
injured
we
never
know
when
our
turn
will
come
he
finished
and
winona
shivered
as
she
kissed
the
letter
and
put
it
away
she
looked
up
sometimes
at
the
calm
clear
globe
of
the
full
moon
and
thought
how
it
was
shining
down
alike
on
the
trenches
of
france
and
the
great
minster
towers
of
seaton
how
many
battles
had
it
seen
in
the
earth
history
and
how
many
still
forms
lying
stiff
and
straight
under
its
pale
beams
men
fought
and
died
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
passed
on
their
way
uncaring
but
god
cared
and
at
the
back
of
it
all
his
hand
was
guiding
the
world
and
even
from
seeming
chaos
would
bring
good
out
of
evil
at
his
own
time
god
bless
percy
and
bring
him
safe
home
prayed
winona
passionately
but
she
felt
in
her
heart
of
hearts
that
if
the
great
captain
called
him
she
could
bend
her
head
in
the
knowledge
that
he
knew
best
with
the
hot
july
weather
aunt
harriet
health
flagged
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
much
older
the
erect
figure
stooped
a
little
her
high
color
had
faded
and
her
voice
lost
some
of
its
energy
and
determination
she
was
not
able
to
fulfill
all
her
former
public
duties
and
she
fretted
greatly
at
the
enforced
inaction
she
was
one
of
those
characters
who
would
rather
wear
out
than
rust
out
and
it
required
the
utmost
firmness
on
the
part
of
her
doctor
to
persuade
her
from
herself
instead
of
being
in
a
continual
whirl
of
crèche
committee
meetings
workhouse
inspections
and
crèche
management
she
now
spent
long
quiet
afternoons
in
the
shaded
learning
that
to
her
hardest
of
all
lessons
how
to
rest
winona
busy
with
the
last
exciting
weeks
of
the
school
term
was
too
occupied
to
give
much
thought
to
her
aunt
but
could
not
help
remarking
that
the
latter
spirits
had
failed
lately
miss
beach
was
far
gentler
than
of
yore
she
did
not
snap
her
niece
up
so
suddenly
or
give
vent
to
excited
tirades
about
subjects
which
irritated
her
sometimes
she
even
looked
at
winona
with
a
wistfulness
that
the
girl
noticed
it
puzzled
her
for
it
was
the
same
glance
that
her
mother
often
cast
at
her
she
was
accustomed
to
shoulder
her
mother
burdens
and
loved
her
all
the
more
for
her
helplessness
and
dependence
but
aunt
harriet
so
strong
and
determined
and
capable
the
oracle
of
the
family
and
the
very
epitome
of
all
the
cardinal
virtues
surely
could
not
want
any
one
to
lean
upon
the
idea
was
unthinkable
yet
again
and
again
it
returned
to
her
and
the
consciousness
of
it
stirred
new
chords
one
evening
winona
came
rather
softly
into
the
her
aunt
sitting
by
the
window
in
the
gathering
twilight
did
not
hear
her
enter
miss
beach
was
reading
and
the
last
little
gleam
of
the
sunset
fell
on
her
gray
hair
how
worn
she
looked
winona
thought
it
had
never
struck
her
so
forcibly
before
was
that
a
tear
shining
on
her
cheek
miss
beach
rose
slowly
put
down
her
book
took
her
handkerchief
from
her
bag
and
deliberately
wiped
her
eyes
then
still
unconscious
of
her
presence
she
went
out
through
the
french
window
into
the
garden
winona
walked
across
the
room
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
did
not
venture
to
follow
her
almost
automatically
she
took
up
the
book
which
aunt
harriet
had
been
reading
it
was
a
little
volume
of
extracts
and
one
had
been
marked
with
a
penciled
cross
put
your
arms
around
me
there
like
that
i
want
a
little
petting
at
life
setting
for
is
harder
to
be
brave
when
feeble
age
comes
creeping
and
finds
me
weeping
dear
ones
gone
just
a
little
petting
at
life
setting
for
i
old
alone
and
tired
and
my
long
life
work
is
done
the
tears
rushed
to
winona
eyes
did
aunt
harriet
really
feel
like
that
oh
why
could
she
not
go
and
comfort
her
she
turned
impulsively
into
the
garden
the
slow
steps
were
coming
back
up
the
paved
walk
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
walk
up
to
her
aunt
and
fling
her
arms
round
her
but
the
old
sense
of
shyness
and
reserve
held
her
back
miss
beach
was
passing
along
the
border
her
dress
brushing
the
flowers
as
she
went
by
it
would
surely
be
easy
to
join
her
and
at
least
to
take
her
arm
easy
no
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
in
her
life
with
her
aunt
a
peck
of
a
kiss
was
the
only
mark
of
affection
that
they
had
hitherto
exchanged
winona
looked
and
longed
to
express
her
sympathy
but
the
invisible
barrier
seemed
strong
as
ever
aunt
harriet
turned
aside
and
went
towards
the
kitchen
the
opportunity
was
lost
how
horribly
we
live
right
inside
ourselves
thought
winona
how
few
people
know
just
what
we
feeling
and
thinking
and
how
hard
it
is
to
let
them
know
the
at
the
back
of
me
is
so
different
from
the
outside
of
me
when
i
want
to
say
things
i
turn
stupid
and
my
tongue
stops
i
suppose
most
other
people
feel
really
the
same
and
we
all
live
in
our
own
little
world
and
only
touch
one
another
now
and
then
human
speech
is
such
a
poor
medium
will
it
be
dropped
in
the
next
life
and
shall
we
talk
with
our
hearts
it
was
on
the
very
morning
after
this
that
winona
received
an
agitated
letter
from
home
her
mother
had
bad
news
percy
had
been
wounded
and
was
in
the
red
cross
hospital
at
prestwick
woodward
wrote
hurriedly
for
she
was
on
the
point
of
starting
off
to
see
him
but
she
promised
to
send
a
bulletin
directly
after
her
visit
winona
spent
a
horrible
day
percy
was
never
for
a
moment
out
of
her
thoughts
the
insufficiency
of
the
information
made
it
harder
to
bear
she
did
not
know
whether
the
wound
was
slight
or
dangerous
and
her
fears
whispered
the
worst
the
next
report
however
was
more
reassuring
percy
had
had
an
operation
and
the
doctors
hoped
that
with
care
he
ought
to
do
well
a
daily
bulletin
would
be
sent
to
his
mother
and
she
promised
to
forward
it
punctually
to
abbey
close
but
i
sha
get
it
till
the
day
afterwards
exclaimed
winona
tragically
oh
how
i
wish
he
were
at
the
red
cross
hospital
here
instead
of
at
prestwick
if
i
could
only
see
him
cheer
up
things
might
be
worse
remarked
her
aunt
briefly
miss
beach
said
no
more
at
the
moment
but
at
supper
time
she
announced
we
shall
have
to
breakfast
early
morning
winona
you
and
i
are
going
to
prestwick
for
the
day
i
asked
miss
bishop
to
let
you
off
to
prestwick
gasped
winona
to
the
red
cross
hospital
oh
aunt
harriet
do
you
suppose
they
let
us
see
percy
it
visitors
day
for
i
telegraphed
to
inquire
i
was
going
on
a
chase
i
assure
you
i
know
the
red
tape
of
hospitals
only
too
well
we
may
see
him
between
and
four
it
a
long
journey
of
course
and
the
trains
are
awkward
from
seaton
but
we
can
be
back
by
nine
oh
thank
you
thank
you
said
winona
with
shining
eyes
she
lay
awake
for
hours
that
night
thinking
of
expedition
her
brain
seemed
turning
round
and
round
in
a
whirl
to
see
percy
and
assure
herself
that
he
was
alive
and
likely
to
recover
oh
it
was
worth
traveling
to
the
north
pole
when
at
last
she
slept
her
dreams
were
a
confusion
of
agonized
escapes
from
zeppelins
or
rushing
from
trenches
pursued
by
germans
she
was
glad
to
wake
even
though
it
was
much
too
early
yet
to
get
up
the
sun
was
only
just
rising
behind
the
minster
towers
never
mind
it
was
morning
and
actually
she
would
see
percy
by
nine
miss
beach
and
winona
were
speeding
along
in
the
express
for
dunningham
here
they
changed
and
began
a
slow
and
tiresome
journey
with
a
couple
of
hours
to
wait
at
an
uninteresting
junction
we
shall
get
back
a
little
quicker
than
we
came
aunt
harriet
explained
because
we
can
take
advantage
of
the
boat
express
which
will
save
us
an
hour
and
a
half
it
most
wearisome
to
jog
along
in
these
local
trains
stopping
at
every
tiny
little
station
one
longs
to
be
in
the
car
said
winona
we
might
have
gone
in
the
car
if
it
had
been
within
reasonable
distance
we
could
possibly
have
motored
to
prestwick
and
back
in
a
day
though
trains
may
be
hot
and
stuffy
but
they
get
one
over
the
ground
it
was
nearly
two
before
they
reached
their
destination
they
had
just
time
for
a
hasty
lunch
at
a
restaurant
and
then
aunt
harriet
hailed
a
taxi
and
they
drove
to
the
hospital
this
was
a
large
fine
house
in
the
suburbs
given
up
by
its
patriotic
owner
to
the
use
of
the
red
cross
as
they
turned
in
at
the
gate
they
could
see
an
attractive
garden
where
groups
of
tommies
in
their
blue
invalid
uniforms
were
lounging
in
deck
chairs
or
lying
full
length
on
rugs
spread
upon
the
grass
an
orderly
showed
them
to
the
office
where
miss
beach
had
a
brief
interview
with
the
commandant
and
they
were
then
escorted
by
a
nurse
to
the
queen
mary
ward
winona
had
not
been
in
a
hospital
before
so
all
was
new
to
her
the
large
airy
room
with
its
polished
floor
and
windows
the
rows
of
beds
each
with
its
little
cupboard
by
the
side
the
table
full
of
flowers
in
the
center
the
nurses
in
their
neat
red
cross
uniforms
she
had
no
time
however
for
more
than
a
hurried
glance
round
her
eyes
were
busy
searching
for
the
one
particular
bed
that
was
the

to
the
side
of
the
room
percy
lay
on
his
back
with
a
cradle
over
his
injured
leg
his
face
was
very
white
and
thin
and
greatly
changed
the
old
boyish
expression
had
vanished
there
were
firm
lines
round
the
mouth
and
a
resolute
look
in
the
eyes
which
had
not
been
there
before
a
few
months
in
the
trenches
and
a
baptism
of
fire
had
transformed
the
careless
lad
into
a
man
tears
glistened
in
winona
eyes
as
she
bent
down
to
kiss
him
it
was
hard
to
see
her
active
brother
lying
helpless
and
suffering
illustration
the
barrier
was
down
at
last
oh
i
better
now
he
replied
in
answer
to
her
inquiries
i
have
pain
all
the
time
i
was
pretty
bad
after
the
meds
had
been
doing
their
carving
i
can
tell
you
i
welcomed
the
morphia
but
i
do
need
it
so
often
now
and
my
leg
going
on
splendidly
it
be
a
job
when
it
finished
old
jackson
promises
to
have
me
out
of
bed
on
crutches
before
so
long
crutches
gasped
winona
in
alarm
why
just
at
first
of
course
we
hope
he
wo
need
to
use
them
for
long
said
aunt
harriet
the
commandant
tells
me
they
very
proud
of
your
case
at
the
hospital
percy
they
flatter
themselves
they
saved
your
leg
where
some
surgeons
would
have
amputated
you
seem
very
comfortable
here
it
a
nice
ward
oh
yes
they
angelic
to
me
i
a
spoilt
child
i
can
tell
you
i
was
lucky
to
get
into
a
cross
they
stuffing
us
here
all
day
and
those
chaps
that

go
about
are
having
the
time
of
their
lives
motor
drives
tea
parties
concerts
and
all
the
rest
of
it
the
prestwick
people
regularly
fête
them
one
of
our
here
has
asked
a
dozen
of
us
out
to
tea
at
her
own
home
i
wish
i
could
go
it
the
nurse
who
showed
you
in
she
ripping
i
always
heard
stands
for
attractive
damsel
laughed
winona
do
lose
your
heart
before
you
percy
said
aunt
harriet
smiling
quite
indulgently
you
two
and
a
half
years
left
yet
when
a
chap
in
the
army
his
age
does
count
declared
percy
with
dignity
most
of
the
beds
in
the
ward
were
empty
at
present
their
owners
being
outside
in
the
garden
only
four
were
occupied
each
of
these
tommies
had
his
own
little
group
of
visitors
and
was
too
busy
talking
to
them
to
take
much
notice
of
anybody
else
miss
beach
spent
a
short
time
at
percy
bedside
then
thinking
that
the
brother
and
sister
would
like
to
be
left
alone
together
she
expressed
her
intention
of
looking
over
the
hospital
and
went
to
find
a
to
show
her
round
it
was
ever
so
decent
of
aunt
harriet
to
bring
you
tiddleywinks
said
percy
the
mater
said
i
must
expect
you
to
come
aunt
harriet
a
trump
when
you
know
her
you
used
to
call
her
a
dragon
i
do
now
look
here
i
often
wish
i
had
burnt
that
paper
of
hers
you
know
what
i
mean
i
kept
thinking
about
it
while
i
been
lying
here
it
was
a
blighter
trick
to
do
when
she
was
paying
my
school
fees
she
ought
to
be
told
about
it
i
feel
that
now
you
have
breathed
anything
have
you
not
a
word
i
promised
you
remember
you
can
keep
a
secret
win
i
say
that
for
you
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
want
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
aunt
harriet
done
a
lot
for
our
family
i
tell
her
now
only
very
likely
when
she
comes
back
a
nurse
will
be
with
her
it
just
could
you
write
to
her
a
ripping
idea
i
never
thought
of
that
i
write
i
be
glad
to
get
it
off
my
mind
somehow
when
one
been
through
all
this
one
feels
quite
differently
about
things
the
entrance
of
tea
trays
interrupted
the
conversation
miss
beach
returned
in
company
with
a
nurse
and
reminded
her
niece
that
if
they
wished
to
catch
their
train
home
they
must
be
starting
at
once
it
was
hard
to
say
but
winona
went
away
infinitely
comforted
dearly
as
she
had
always
loved
the
old
percy
she
felt
the
new
one
whom
she
had
met
had
the
makings
of
a
stronger
and
finer
character
than
she
had
ever
dared
to
hope
the
commandant
gives
an
excellent
report
of
him
said
miss
beach
as
they
drove
away
i
asked
her
particularly
if
there
were
any
likelihood
of
his
remaining
lame
but
she
says
not
the
surgeon
declares
he
have
him
back
in
the
trenches
in
the
autumn
how
glorious
percy
just
wild
to
go
back
i
believe
he
do
something
splendid
and
get
a
commission
or
perhaps
win
the
victoria
cross
winona
face
shone
she
had
been
proud
of
percy
the
long
journey
home
to
seaton
was
very
tedious
though
not
quite
so
trying
as
the
morning
one
for
they
were
able
to
catch
the
boat
express
to
lapton
and
have
tea
on
the
train
at
lapton
junction
however
they
were
obliged
to
change
to
a
local
line
and
jog
along
at
the
rate
of
about
thirty
miles
an
hour
in
a
particularly
dusty
compartment
it
had
been
a
hard
day
for
miss
beach
she
looked
very
weary
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
corner
so
overdone
indeed
that
winona
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
have
one
of
her
heart
attacks
the
threatened
trouble
passed
however
and
as
the
evening
grew
cooler
she
seemed
to
revive
the
trains
were
late
so
it
was
nearly
ten
before
they
at
last
reached
home
pleased
with
our
day
outing
to
quote
pepys
said
aunt
harriet
it
was
worth
going
if
it
has
tired
you
too
much
winona
ventured
to
add
on
the
following
sunday
morning
miss
beach
received
a
letter
from
percy
she
made
no
comment
upon
it
at
the
time
but
in
the
evening
after
church
when
she
and
winona
were
walking
in
the
garden
in
the
twilight
she
referred
to
it
i
deeply
touched
by
percy
letter
she
remarked
i
did
not
think
the
boy
had
such
nice
feeling
in
him
you
understand
of
course
what
he
has
written
to
me
about
oh
aunt
harriet
has
he
told
you
burst
out
winona
oh
i
so
very
very
glad
i
been
longing
and
yearning
to
tell
you
all
these
years
only
i
could
because
i
promised
and
oh
i
must
tell
you
now
i
asked
you
about
your
will
and
you
thought
i
was
horrid
and
scheming
but
it
was
that
at
all
it
was
that
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
the
will
was
there
and
hoped
that
perhaps
you
look
oh
please
believe
me
that
i
did
mean
to
hint
that
you
should
leave
anything
to
me
i
do
want
anything
you
been
so
good
to
me
i
owe
you
a
thousand
times
more
than
i
can
ever
pay
back
i
always
wanted
to
make
you
understand
this
but
somehow
i
could
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
for
all
you
done
for
me
i
shall
be
better
all
my
life
for
having
lived
with
you
and
known
you
i
a
different
person
since
i
came
to
seaton
and
i
owe
it
entirely
to
you
the
barrier
was
down
at
last
for
once
winona
spoke
straight
from
her
heart
miss
beach
took
off
her
wiped
them
and
put
them
in
their
case
her
hand
was
trembling
i
wish
i
had
known
this
before
child
she
said
with
a
break
in
her
voice
here
for
nearly
two
years
i
have
been
thinking
hard
things
of
you
and
imagining
that
you
were
plotting
and
scheming
to
get
my
money
you
hurt
me
beyond
expression
when
you
asked
if
i
had
made
my
will
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
document
is
safe
at
my
lawyer
the
paper
which
percy
destroyed
was
only
a
rough
draft
i
had
forgotten
its
existence
but
you
do
believe
me
urged
winona
you
know
i
had
none
of
those
horrible
plans
oh
dear
aunt
harriet
money
is
nothing
nothing
it
is
you
yourself
i
love
if
you
only
let
me
and
in
the
dusk
of
the
garden
winona
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
flung
her
warm
young
arms
round
her
aunt
and
hugged
her
heartily
chapter
xxi
the
end
of
the
term
look
here
my
hearties
said
winona
to
the
cricket
team
do
you
realize
that
seaton
binworth
is
on
wednesday
week
if
you
do
it
time
you
did
and
you
better
buck
up
my
opinion
of
you
at
this
present
moment
is
that
you
a
set
of
loafers
what
are
you
doing
lounging
about
here
when
you
ought
to
be
practicing
for
all
worth
the
little
group
sitting
on
the
grass
under
the
lilac
bushes
smiled
indulgently
go
ahead
lay
it
on
thick
twittered
betty

we
knew
when
you
hove
into
sight
that
we
might
expect
some
it
all
very
fine
to
sermonize
yawned
maggie
allesley
but
oblige
me
very
much
by
going
indoors
and
inspecting
the
thermometer
in
the
hall
one
ca
tear
about
in
this
heat
added
irene
swinburne
what
a
set
of
dainty
sybarites
you
are
no
one
would
ever
win
matches
if
they
waited
for
the
right
kind
of
day
to
practice
it
always
too
hot
or
too
cold
or
too
wet
or
too
something
well
it
decidedly
too
something
do
roast
us
but
i
shall
roast
you
mean
to
let
binworth
have
a
complete
i
tell
you
what
if
you
ca
or
wo
play
during
the
heat
will
you
all
come
back
to
school
for
an
hour
every
evening
and
practice
then
i
square
it
up
with
miss
bishop
i
sure
she
mind
there
sense
in
your
remarks
now
admitted
irene
sitting
up
game
if
others
are
and
so
this
child
agreed
betty
carlise
i
can
put
the
screw
on
cassie
and
nell
and
bring
them
along
any
evening
then
mind
you
do
i
going
to
take
an
oath
of
the
whole
team
to
meet
here
at
seven
each
night
i
shall
write
it
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
make
you
all
put
your
names
to
it
like
signing
the
pledge
right
you
are
o
your
humble
servants
their
captain
suggestion
of
an
evening
cricket
practice
was
welcomed
by
the
team
and
approved
by
miss
bishop
it
was
delightfully
cool
at
seven
the
girls
instead
of
being
languid
and
were
energetic
and
enthusiastic
and
their
play
became
a
different
matter
altogether
winona
who
had
been
decidedly
down
about
the
prospects
of
the
match
began
to
feel
more
confidence
betty
bowling
was
improving
daily
and
irene
who
had
been
given
to
blind
swiping
was
gaining
discretion
if
they
would
continue
to
make
progress
at
the
same
rate
seaton
would
have
a
chance
it
would
be
too
bad
if
we
lost
the
last
match
of
the
season
fluttered
winona
while
i
your
captain
i
want
to
break
the
record
all
right
old
girl
it
shall
be
a
kind
of
charge
of
the
light
brigade
but
to
do
or
die
it
will
probably
be
a
broiling
hot
day
but
we
play
till
we
drop
betty
assured
her
only
have
the
ambulance
corps
ready
with
fans
and
stretchers
to
revive
us
and
bear
us
from
the
field
added
irene
giggling
i
see
there
lemonade
for
you
though
to
winona
as
games
captain
seaton
binworth
seemed
the
one
event
worth
living
for
there
were
plenty
of
other
interests
going
on
in
the
school
linda
fletcher
the
head
girl
was
arranging
a
program
for
the
parents
afternoon
the
efficient
performance
of
which
was
in
her
eyes
of
infinitely
greater
public
importance
than
the
cricket
match
she
also
required
numerous
rehearsals
and
the
conflicting
claims
on
the
girls
time
became
so
confusing
that
after
one
or
two
struggles
between
rival
whips
who
contended
hotly
for
possession
the
chiefs
were
obliged
to
strike
a
bargain
winona
releasing
two
members
of
the
team
in
order
that
they
might
act
and
filling
up
their
places
from
her
reserve
while
linda
undertook
to
leave
the
rest
of
the
eleven
out
of
her
calculations
after
this
there
was
peace
and
violet
agnew
and
averil
walmer
who
had
been
secretly
burning
to
distinguish
themselves
in
the
dramatic
line
in
preference
to
athletics
could
meet
winona
with
clear
consciences
among
other
items
of
the
program
linda
had
fixed
upon
a
french
pastoral
play
which
was
to
be
acted
in
the
garden
among
the
trees
and
lilac
bushes
the
girls
were
really
supposed
to
get
up
the
whole
of
the
little
entertainment
by
themselves
but
mademoiselle
was
kind
in
this
instance
and
helped
to
coach
them
the
scene
was
to
be
a
fête
champêtre
and
the
costumes
were
to
be
copied
from
some
of
pictures
there
were
tremendous
consultations
over
them
a
dressmaking
bee
was
held
every
afternoon
from
four
to
five
in
the
small
miss
bishop
generously
lending
her
sewing
machine
for
the
purpose
here
a
band
of
willing
workers
sat
and
stitched
and
chattered
and
laughed
and
ate
chocolates
while
pretty
garments
grew
rapidly
under
their
fingers
the
dresses
were
only
made
of
cheap
materials
and
were
hastily
put
together
but
they
had
a
very
good
effect
for
the
colors
were
gay
and
the
style
with
its
panniers
and
lace
frills
was
charming
the
girls
would
hardly
have
managed
the
cutting
out
quite
unaided
had
not
miss
lever
offered
her
assistance
dollikins
had
large
experience
in
the
preparation
of
school
theatricals
and
possessed
many
invaluable
paper
patterns
so
she
was
given
a
royal
welcome
and
installed
at
the
table
with
the
biggest
and
sharpest
pair
of
scissors
at
her
disposal
on
the
afternoon
fixed
for
the
entertainment
quite
a
goodly
audience
assembled
to
watch
and
applaud
mothers
were
in
the
majority
with
a
fair
number
of
aunts
and
elder
sisters
and
just
a
sprinkling
of
fathers
forms
had
been
carried
into
the
garden
and
arranged
as
an
amateur
theater
a
flat
piece
of
lawn
with
a
background
of
bushes
serving
as
stage
the
program
was
to
be
representative
of
the
whole
school
so
the
first
part
was
devoted
to
the
performances
of
the
juniors
twelve
small
damsels
selected
from
forms
and
ii
gave
a
classic
dance
they
were
dressed
in
greek
costume
with
sandals
and
wore
chaplets
of
roses
round
their
hair
they
had
been
carefully
trained
by
miss
barbour
the
drill
mistress
and
went
through
their
parts
with
a
joyousness
reminiscent
of
the
golden
age
the
morris
dance
which
followed
rendered
by
members
of
forms
iii
and
though
hardly
so
graceful
was
sprightly
and
in
good
time
the
fantastic
dresses
with
their
bells
and
ribbons
suiting
most
of
their
wearers
it
was
felt
that
the
juniors
had
distinguished
themselves
and
dollikins
who
with
miss
barbour
had
worked
hard
on
their
behalf
felt
almost
justified
in
bragging
of
their
achievements
meantime
the
seniors
had
been
making
ready
and
presently
from
behind
the
bushes
tripped
forth
a
charming
group
of
louis
xv
courtiers
pattering
the
prettiest
of
french
remarks
dorrie
pollack
as
monsieur
le
duc
de
tourville
was
a
model
of
gallantry
in
a
feathered
hat
and
stiff
ringlets
the
result
of
an
agonizing
night
passed
in
tight
knobby
curl
papers
while
linda
as
madame
la
comtesse
quite
outdid
herself
in
the
depth
of
her
curtseys
and
the
distinguished
grace
with
which
she
extended
her
hand
for
her
cavalier
to
kiss
nora
wilson
tripped
over
her
sword
in
her
excitement
and
violet
agnew
forgot
her
part
and
had
to
be
prompted
by
mademoiselle
who
stood
with
the
book
behind
a
bush
but
these
were
only
minor
accidents
and
on
the
whole
the
scene
passed
off
with
flying
colors
and
greatly
impressed
the
parents
and
aunts
with
the
high
stage
of
proficiency
in
the
french
language
attained
by
the
pupils
of
seaton
high
school
linda
was
so
elated
by
the
success
of
the
afternoon
that
she
sat
up
long
after
she
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
that
night
writing
an
account
of
the
proceedings
for
the
school
magazine
the
manuscript
couched
in
antique
language
was
headed
ye
seaton
chronicle
then
whereas
ye
damsels
at
ye
schule
had
laboured
well
and
diligently
during
many
days
at
ye
tasks
set
them
by
their
reverend
elders
it
seemed
good
to
those
that
did
govern
to
appoint
unto
them
a
day
to
make
merry
and
rejoice
therefore
did
they
choose
out
certain
among
them
and
arraying
them
in
goodly
fashion
did
charge
them
to
dance
to
instruments
of
music
before
ye
face
of
ye
whole
assembly
of
ye
damsels
and
likewise
of
some
of
their
kindred
ye
which
were
gathered
together
then
did
ye
maids
with
no
small
skill
tread
ye
dance
clad
in
fair
garments
with
gauds
and
ornaments
of
silver
upon
them
at
ye
sight
of
which
their
kindred
did
raise
cries
of
joy
and
did
further
make
great
ado
with
clapping
of
ye
hands
and
when
ye
little
maidens
had
duly
presented
their
dances
before
ye
company
then
did
ye
elder
damosels
give
a
goodly
masque
being
decked
forth
in
brave
trappings
and
speaking
cunningly
in
ye
tongue
of
ye
fair
lande
of
france
wherein
all
who
heard
them
might
well
understand
and
ye
kindred
and
alle
they
that
were
gathered
together
for
to
look
upon
them
did
in
kindness
and
with
glad
hearts
commend
them
and
did
of
their
charity
vouchsafe
to
say
that
ye
like
had
not
aforetime
been
witnessed
at
ye
schule
whereat
ye
maidens
rejoiced
greatly
as
evenso
it
seemed
unto
them
a
reward
for
their
diligent
labour
we
shall
leave
an
account
of
our
doings
behind
us
said
linda
to
some
of
her
friends
in
the
sixth
for
the
copies
of
the
school
magazine
are
to
be
bound
and
kept
in
the
library
for
ever
and
a
day
future
generations
of
girls
will
at
least
see
our
names
and
our
form
photo
if
they
do
know
anything
else
about
us
winona
was
living
for
one
event
the
match
with
binworth
this
was
not
to
take
place
on
the
playing
grounds
of
either
school
but
on
a
very
superior
cricket
ground
hired
for
the
occasion
from
a
local
club
winona
as
secretary
for
seaton
had
made
fullest
arrangements
including
the
presence
in
the
pavilion
of
a
cheery
little
woman
from
a
neighboring
restaurant
who
undertook
the
purveying
of
lemonade
ginger
pop
cakes
and
any
fruit
which
might
be
obtainable
for
the
occasion
tickets
of
admission
to
the
ground
were
issued
and
distributed
throughout
the
school
public
opinion
deeming
attendance
almost
compulsory
the
team
were
inspected
and
criticized
beforehand
almost
as
the
roman
gladiators
used
to
be
reviewed
by
their
patrons
winona
was
on
the
whole
proud
of
her
eleven
though
not
up
to
the
lofty
standard
at
which
she
had
aimed
she
felt
that
they
realized
a
very
respectable
degree
of
merit
the
ground
lay
a
few
miles
out
of
the
city
and
was
reached
as
a
rule
by
tramcar
but
as
the
ordinary
service
would
be
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
the
large
numbers
who
proposed
going
special
omnibuses
and
brakes
had
been
put
on
for
the
occasion
to
accommodate
the
school
which
turned
out
almost
in
full
force
to
witness
the
show
binworth
also
contributed
its
quota
of
spectators
so
the
stands
of
the
cricket
ground
were
rapidly
filled
winona
had
a
short
preliminary
talk
with
dora
evans
who
commanded
the
rival
team
and
as
soon
as
the
clock
in
the
pavilion
pointed
to
the
captains
stood
out
to
toss
heads
cried
winona
it
tails
your
choice
we
bat
then
decreed
dora
winona
placed
her
field
at
once
and
dora
after
a
whispered
word
or
two
to
her
team
selected
her
first
bats
one
was
a
looking
girl
who
hummed
a
tune
as
she
came
with
ostentatious
carelessness
the
other
stout
and
dark
blinked
her
eyes
nervously
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
judge
their
capacities
beforehand
betty
carlisle
was
to
take
the
first
over
she
had
a
high
overhand
action
and
sent
the
ball
down
the
pitch
at
a
good
pace
lottie
moir
the
damsel
who
faced
the
bowling
was
cautious
she
played
the
first
ball
respectfully
back
to
the
bowler
the
next
being
of
good
length
she
played
quietly
to
for
one
she
was
evidently
not
out
to
take
risks
and
the
rest
of
the
over
she
did
not
attempt
to
score
her
partner
meg
perkins
was
a
fairly
brilliant
but
more
reckless
player
the
first
ball
she
received
came
down
at
a
good
pace
but
well
on
the
of
the
wicket
a
cut
sent
it
flying
to
the
short
boundary
for
two
perhaps
the
success
turned
her
head
a
little
the
next
ball
pitched
well
to
the
she
made
a
mighty
stroke
at
it
not
allowing
for
the
break
and
missed
it
altogether
next
moment
she
was
walking
ruefully
back
to
the
pavilion
phyllis
knight
the
next
bat
was
evidently
regarded
by
the
binworth
team
as
a
champion
she
was
tall
and
decidedly
athletic
looking
winona
nodded
to
irene
swinburne
celebrated
for
her
twisters
and
irene
went
on
to
bowl
phyllis
had
a
long
reach
which
she
employed
successfully
in
driving
the
first
ball
she
received
right
along
the
ground
into
the
country
for
three
seaton
began
to
look
rather
glum
the
next
ball
she
irene
was
growing
desperate
phyllis
was
waiting
with
her
bat
slightly
raised
now
if
only
i
can
drop
the
ball
just
under
that
bat
out
she
goes
said
irene
to
herself
and
sent
the
swiftest
she
knew
how
phyllis
made
a
slash
at
it
evidently
thinking
it
a
half
volley
but
alas
her
bails
flew
and
the
seaton
contingent
were
roaring
well
bowled
none
of
the
rest
of
the
binworth
team
approached
to
phyllis
standard
though
they
played
with
caution
and
their
score
mounted
up
steadily
at
the
end
of
their
innings
sixty
was
up
on
the
board
the
binworth
captain
now
arranged
her
field
and
winona
sent
in
bessie
kirk
and
irene
swinburne
to
face
the
bowling
of
meg
perkins
at
one
end
and
phyllis
knight
at
the
other
at
first
things
did
not
go
over
well
for
seaton
bessie
kirk
fell
a
victim
to
meg
crafty
slows
she
played
too
soon
at
a
ball
and
spooned
a
catch
to
irene
at
first
scored
merrily
but
growing
foolhardy
was
clean
bowled
by
phyllis
knight
to
her
huge
discomfiture
betty
carlisle
and
maggie
allesley
met
with
better
luck
and
the
score
began
to
creep
up
the
seaton
girls
breathed
more
freely
audrey
redfern
and
lizzie
morris
came
up
next
lizzie
broke
her
duck
in
the
first
over
and
gaining
confidence
began
to
get
her
eye
in
and
with
audrey
with
dogged
persistence
at
the
other
end
and
now
and
then
making
a
single
the
score
reached
there
were
only
ten
minutes
left
winona
began
to
grow
desperate
she
came
forth
herself
now
with
a
look
of
determination
on
her
face
dora
evans
at
once
rolled
the
ball
to
lottie
moir
winona
took
her
block
composedly
lottie
might
with
advantage
have
been
put
on
before
her
style
though
by
no
means
swift
was
most
awkward
to
play
winona
in
the
first
over
did
not
attempt
to
score
she
wished
to
take
the
measure
of
her
opponent
in
the
next
over
her
partner
made
a
single
which
brought
winona
to
the
opposite
wicket
the
first
ball
came
well
on
the
and
she
sent
it
flying
to
the
boundary
for
four
was
now
up
on
the
board
and
there
were
only
five
minutes
left
perhaps
lottie
moir
was
tired
or
waxed
a
little
careless
the
next
ball
she
sent
down
was
an
easy
full
pitch
winona
waited
till
just
the
right
moment
and
then
with
a
fine
swing
of
her
bat
sent
the
ball
clean
over
the
boundary
for
six
the
match
was
won
and
seaton
in
the
ecstasy
of
victory
was
cheering
itself
hoarse
i
never
thought
we
do
it
murmured
winona
to
betty
as
they
drank
ginger
pop
together
in
the
pavilion
i
reckoned
our
captain
would
fail
us
chuckled
betty
delightedly
linda
must
compose
an
epic
on
it
for
the
school
magazine
it
beats
marathon
in
my
opinion
well
i
glad
my
last
match
at
the
old
has
been
a
success
anyway
seaton
binworth
had
taken
place
on
wednesday
and
the
school
had
scarcely
finished
exulting
over
its
triumph
before
another
matter
claimed
its
attention
on
thursday
morning
the
results
of
the
examination
arrived
miss
bishop
summoned
the
whole
school
into
the
lecture
hall
to
hear
the
news
she
was
looking
flushed
and
excited
she
waited
a
few
moments
as
if
to
give
extra
effect
to
her
words
then
announced
i
have
just
received
the
results
of
the
entrance
examinations
from
dunningham
university
out
of
twelve
candidates
who
were
entered
from
this
school
ten
have
satisfied
the
examiners
their
names
stand
as
follows
in
order
of
merit
first
class
garnet
emerson
second
class
linda
fletcher
agatha
james
helena
maitland
freda
long
third
class
mary
payne
hilda
langley
winona
woodward
dorrie
pollack
estelle
harrison
winona
heaved
an
immense
sigh
of
mingled
amazement
and
relief
she
had
passed
actually
passed
she
winona
woodward
whose
form
record
had
never
soared
above
the
most
modest
average
it
was
an
unprecedented
and
altogether
delightful
finale
to
her
school
career
for
the
moment
she
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
true
but
miss
bishop
had
not
finished
her
speech
she
held
up
her
hand
to
stop
the
burst
of
clapping
and
continued
as
you
are
aware
the
governors
of
the
school
offered
a
three
scholarship
tenable
at
dunningham
university
to
whichever
of
the
candidates
should
head
the
list
being
not
lower
than
second
class
garnet
emerson
who
has
secured
a
first
class
is
therefore
at
the
desire
of
the
governors
awarded
the
scholarship
now
if
you
like
to
clap
for
her
you
may
do
so
that
garnet
her
dear
garnet
should
have
won
the
coveted
scholarship
put
the
on
winona
glee
she
squeezed
her
friend
hand
afterwards
in
an
ecstasy
of
congratulation
garnet
said
little
so
little
that
her
enthusiastic
chum
was
almost
disappointed
winona
judging
by
her
own
feelings
expected
her
to
be
at
delirium
point
beatrice
howell
and
olave
parry
the
two
candidates
who
had
failed
were
receiving
condolences
with
chastened
resignation
the
rest
were
in
various
stages
of
jubilee
that
evening
about
six
a
small
packet
was
left
at
abbey
close
directed
to
miss
winona
woodward
she
opened
it
eagerly
it
held
a
small
jewelers
box
containing
a
beautiful
little
ring
and
was
accompanied
by
a
letter
from
garnet
dear
win
so
the
letter
ran
you
must
have
thought
me
slack
this
morning
when
you
were
congratulating
me
but
the
fact
was
i
was
utterly
overwhelmed
i
hoped
and
hoped
to
win
the
scholarship
and
then
put
the
idea
away
and
when
i
knew
my
good
fortune
i
just
felt
stunned
it
all
owing
to
you
for
if
you
had
helped
me
i
could
never
never
even
have
passed
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
words
are
quite
inadequate
but
will
you
believe
that
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
all
the
rest
of
my
life
and
will
you
accept
this
little
ring
and
wear
it
for
my
sake
it
is
a
garnet
and
belonged
to
my
grandmother
after
whom
i
was
named
i
value
it
greatly
but
i
would
far
rather
know
you
have
it
than
keep
it
myself
always
your
most
grateful
friend
garnet
emerson
there
was
a
further
surprise
for
winona
that
evening
when
supper
was
over
and
she
and
miss
beach
were
taking
their
usual
twilight
stroll
round
the
garden
aunt
harriet
who
had
been
silent
for
a
few
minutes
suddenly
spoke
i
wish
to
say
something
to
you
winona
i
very
gratified
indeed
to
hear
that
you
have
passed
your
college
examinations
it
has
given
me
a
better
opinion
of
your
capacity
and
perseverance
than
i
possessed
before
this
result
combined
with
your
conduct
in
coaching
your
friend
through
all
these
weeks
has
decided
me
in
a
project
that
i
was
debating
in
my
mind
i
am
going
to
send
you
either
to
a
physical
training
college
to
qualify
as
a
games
mistress
or
to
a
horticultural
college
to
prepare
for
a
national
rural
economy
diploma
whichever
career
you
decide
to
choose
i
am
resolved
that
you
shall
have
the
best
training
available
oh
aunt
harriet
thank
you
thank
you
i
do
deserve
it
faltered
winona
the
end
of
the
term
had
come
at
length
the
next
day
was
winona
very
last
at
seaton
high
school
she
was
loth
to
leave
for
the
two
years
she
had
passed
there
had
been
the
happiest
and
the
fullest
in
her
life
but
though
the
past
had
pleasant
memories
the
future
also
held
out
fair
hopes
to
her
as
she
entered
miss
bishop
study
to
say
the
looked
up
kindly
i
shall
miss
you
winona
i
have
just
been
turning
over
your
school
record
it
not
perhaps
brilliant
but
it
has
been
persevering
and
i
am
sure
you
done
your
best
i
am
particularly
pleased
that
you
have
passed
your
examination
as
games
captain
you
have
been
a
decided
asset
to
the
school
i
think
i
may
safely
say
that
you
have
justified
the
decision
of
the
governors
in
allowing
you
to
hold
the
county
scholarship
your
aunt
tells
me
that
you
are
to
go
in
either
for
physical
training
or
horticulture
do
decide
in
a
hurry
get
to
know
as
much
as
you
can
about
both
and
think
the
matter
over

if
ever
you
want
a
friend
to
come

me
outside
in
the
playground

nudged

thrust
a

parcel

hurriedly
