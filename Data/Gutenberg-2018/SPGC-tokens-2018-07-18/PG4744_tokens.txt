night
the
first
the
sickle
and
sheaf
ten
years
ago
business
required
me
to
pass
a
day
in
cedarville
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
stage
set
me
down
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
a
new
tavern
just
opened
by
a
new
landlord
in
a
new
house
built
with
the
special
end
of
providing
accommodations
for
man
and
beast
as
i
stepped
from
the
dusty
old
vehicle
in
which
i
had
been
jolted
along
a
rough
road
for
some
thirty
miles
feeling
tired
and
hungry
the
face
of
simon
slade
the
landlord
beaming
as
it
did
with
a
hearty
welcome
was
really
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
and
the
grasp
of
his
hand
was
like
that
of
a
true
friend
i
felt
as
i
entered
the
new
and
neatly
furnished
adjoining
the
bar
that
i
had
indeed
found
a
comfortable
after
my
wearisome
journey
all
as
nice
as
a
new
pin
said
i
approvingly
as
i
glanced
around
the
room
up
to
the
ceiling
white
as
the
driven
snow
and
over
the
handsomely
carpeted
floor
have
seen
anything
so
inviting
as
this
how
long
have
you
been
open
only
a
few
months
answered
the
gratified
landlord
but
we
are
not
yet
in
good
going
order
it
takes
time
you
know
to
bring
everything
into
the
right
shape
have
you
dined
yet
no
everything
looked
so
dirty
at
the
where
we
stopped
to
get
dinner
that
i
could
venture
upon
the
experiment
of
eating
how
long
before
your
supper
will
be
ready
in
an
hour
replied
the
landlord
that
will
do
let
me
have
a
nice
piece
of
tender
steak
and
the
loss
of
dinner
will
soon
be
forgotten
you
shall
have
that
cooked
fit
for
an
alderman
said
the
landlord
i
call
my
wife
the
best
cook
in
cedarville
as
he
spoke
a
neatly
dressed
girl
about
sixteen
years
of
age
with
rather
an
attractive
countenance
passed
through
the
room
my
daughter
said
the
landlord
as
she
vanished
through
the
door
there
was
a
sparkle
of
pride
in
the
father
eyes
and
a
certain
tenderness
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
as
he
said
my
daughter
that
told
me
she
was
very
dear
to
him
you
are
a
happy
man
to
have
so
fair
a
child
said
i
speaking
more
in
compliment
than
with
a
careful
choice
of
words
i
am
a
happy
man
was
the
landlord
smiling
answer
his
fair
round
face
unwrinkled
by
a
line
of
care
or
trouble
beaming
with
i
have
always
been
a
happy
man
and
always
expect
to
be
simon
slade
takes
the
world
as
it
comes
and
takes
it
easy
my
son
sir
he
added
as
a
boy
in
his
twelfth
year
came
in
speak
to
the
gentleman
the
boy
lifted
to
mine
a
pair
of
deep
blue
eyes
from
which
innocence
beamed
as
he
offered
me
his
hand
and
said
respectfully
how
do
you
do
sir
i
could
not
but
remark
the
beauty
of
his
face
in
which
the
hardier
firmness
of
the
boy
character
was
already
visible
what
is
your
name
i
asked
frank
sir
frank
is
his
name
said
the
landlord
we
called
him
after
his
uncle
frank
and
flora
the
names
sound
pleasant
to
the
ears
but
you
know
parents
are
apt
to
be
a
little
partial
and
over
fond
better
that
extreme
than
its
opposite
i
remarked
just
what
i
always
say
frank
my
son
the
landlord
spoke
to
the
boy
there
some
one
in
the
bar
you
can
wait
on
him
as
well
as
i
can
the
lad
glided
from
the
room
in
ready
obedience
a
handy
boy
that
sir
a
very
handy
boy
almost
as
good
in
the
bar
as
a
man
he
mixes
a
toddy
or
a
punch
just
as
well
as
i
can
but
i
suggested
are
you
not
a
little
afraid
of
placing
one
so
young
in
the
way
of
temptation
temptation
the
open
brows
of
simon
slade
contracted
a
little
no
sir
he
replied
emphatically
the
till
is
safer
under
his
care
than
it
would
be
in
that
of
one
man
in
ten
the
boy
comes
sir
of
honest
parents
simon
slade
never
wronged
anybody
out
of
a
farthing
oh
said
i
quickly
you
altogether
misapprehend
me
i
had
no
reference
to
the
till
but
to
the
bottle
the
landlord
brows
were
instantly
unbent
and
a
broad
smile
circled
over
his
face
is
that
all
nothing
to
fear
i
can
assure
you
frank
has
no
taste
for
liquor
and
might
pour
it
out
for
mouths
without
a
drop
finding
its
way
to
his
lips
nothing
to
apprehend
there
sir
nothing
i
saw
that
further
suggestions
of
danger
would
be
useless
and
so
remained
silent
the
arrival
of
a
traveler
called
away
the
landlord
and
i
was
left
alone
for
observation
and
reflection
the
bar
adjoined
the
neat
and
i
could
see
through
the
open
door
the
customer
upon
whom
the
lad
was
attending
he
was
a
young
man
or
rather
boy
for
he
did
not
appear
to
be
over
nineteen
years
of
age
with
a
fine
intelligent
face
that
was
already
slightly
marred
by
sensual
indulgence
he
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
with
a
quick
almost
eager
motion
and
drained
it
at
a
single
draught
just
right
said
he
tossing
a
sixpence
to
the
young
you
are
first
rate
at
a
never
drank
a
better
in
my
life
the
lad
smiling
face
told
that
he
was
gratified
by
the
compliment
to
me
the
sight
was
painful
for
i
saw
that
this
youthful
tippler
was
on
dangerous
ground
who
is
that
young
man
in
the
bar
i
asked
a
few
minutes
afterward
on
being
rejoined
by
the
landlord
simon
slade
stepped
to
the
door
and
looked
into
the
bar
for
a
moment
two
or
three
men
were
there
by
this
time
but
he
was
at
no
loss
in
answering
my
question
oh
that
a
son
of
judge
hammond
who
lives
in
the
large
brick
house
as
you
enter
the
village
willy
hammond
as
everybody
familiarly
calls
him
is
about
the
finest
young
man
in
our
neighborhood
there
is
nothing
proud
or
about
him
nothing
even
if
his
father
is
a
judge
and
rich
into
the
bargain
every
one
gentle
or
simple
likes
willy
hammond
and
then
he
is
such
good
company
always
so
cheerful
and
always
with
a
pleasant
story
on
his
tongue
and
he
so
withal
and
so
honorable
willy
hammond
would
lose
his
right
hand
rather
than
be
guilty
of
a
mean
action
landlord
the
voice
came
loud
from
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
and
simon
slade
again
left
me
to
answer
the
demands
of
some
i
went
into
the
in
order
to
take
a
closer
observation
of
willy
hammond
in
whom
an
interest
not
unmingled
with
concern
had
already
been
awakened
in
my
mind
i
found
him
engaged
in
a
pleasant
conversation
with
a
farmer
whose
homely
terse
common
sense
was
quite
as
conspicuous
as
his
fine
play
of
words
and
lively
fancy
the
farmer
was
a
substantial
conservative
and
young
hammond
a
warm
admirer
of
new
ideas
and
the
quicker
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
i
soon
saw
that
his
mental
powers
were
developed
beyond
his
years
while
his
personal
qualities
were
strongly
attractive
i
understood
better
after
being
a
silent
listener
and
observer
for
ten
minutes
why
the
landlord
had
spoken
of
him
so
warmly
take
a
mr
h
said
hammond
after
the
discussion
closed
good
humoredly
frank
our
junior
here
beats
his
father
in
that
line
i
do
care
if
i
do
returned
the
farmer
and
the
two
passed
up
to
the
bar
now
frank
my
boy
do
belie
my
praises
said
the
young
man
do
your
handsomest
two
did
you
say
frank
made
inquiry
with
quite
a
professional
air
just
what
i
did
say
and
let
them
be
equal
to
jove
nectar
pleased
at
this
familiarity
the
boy
went
briskly
to
his
work
of
mixing
the
tempting
compound
while
hammond
looked
on
with
an
approving
smile
there
said
the
latter
as
frank
passed
the
glasses
across
the
counter
if
you
do
call
that
you
no
judge
and
he
handed
one
of
them
to
the
farmer
who
tasted
the
agreeable
draught
and
praised
its
flavor
as
before
i
noticed
that
hammond
drank
eagerly
like
one
athirst
emptying
his
glass
without
once
taking
it
from
his
lips
soon
after
the
was
empty
and
then
i
walked
around
the
premises
in
company
with
the
landlord
and
listened
to
his
praise
of
everything
and
his
plans
and
purposes
for
the
future
the
house
yard
garden
and
were
in
the
most
perfect
order
presenting
in
the
whole
a
model
of
a
village
tavern
whatever
i
do
sir
said
the
talkative
simon
slade
i
like
to
do
well
i
was
just
raised
to
you
must
know
but
i
am
one
who
can
turn
his
hand
to
almost
any
thing
what
was
your
business
i
inquired
i
a
miller
sir
by
trade
he
answered
and
a
better
miller
though
i
say
it
myself
is
not
to
be
found
in
bolton
county
followed
milling
these
twenty
years
and
made
some
little
money
but
i
got
tired
of
hard
work
and
determined
to
lead
an
easier
life
so
i
sold
my
mill
and
built
this
house
with
the
money
i
always
thought
like
it
an
easy
life
and
if
rightly
seen
after
one
in
which
a
man
is
sure
to
make
money
you
were
still
doing
a
fair
business
with
your
mill
oh
yes
whatever
i
do
i
do
right
last
year
i
put
by
a
thousand
dollars
above
all
expenses
which
is
not
bad
i
can
assure
you
for
a
mere
grist
mill
if
the
present
owner
comes
out
even
he
do
well
how
is
that
oh
he
no
miller
give
him
the
best
wheat
that
is
grown
and
ruin
it
in
grinding
he
takes
the
life
out
of
every
grain
i
believe
he
keep
half
the
custom
that
i
transferred
with
the
mill
a
thousand
dollars
clear
profit
in
so
useful
a
business
ought
to
have
satisfied
you
said
i
there
you
and
i
differ
answered
the
landlord
every
man
desires
to
make
as
much
money
as
possible
and
with
the
least
labor
i
hope
to
make
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
a
year
over
and
above
all
expenses
at
my
bar
alone
ought
to
yield
me
that
sum
a
man
with
a
wife
and
children
very
naturally
tries
to
do
as
well
by
them
as
possible
very
true
but
i
ventured
to
suggest
will
this
be
doing
as
well
by
them
as
if
you
had
kept
on
at
the
mill
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
a
year
against
one
thousand
where
are
your
figures
man
there
may
be
something
beyond
money
to
take
into
the
account
said
i
what
inquired
slade
with
a
kind
of
half
credulity
consider
the
different
influences
of
the
two
callings
in
life
that
of
a
miller
and
a
well
say
on
will
your
children
be
as
safe
from
temptation
here
as
in
their
former
home
just
as
safe
was
the
unhesitating
answer
why
not
i
was
about
to
speak
of
the
alluring
glass
in
the
case
of
frank
but
remembering
that
i
had
already
expressed
a
fear
in
that
direction
felt
that
to
do
so
again
would
be
useless
and
so
kept
silent
a
said
slade
is
just
as
respectable
as
a
miller
in
fact
the
very
people
who
used
to
call
me
or
dustycoat
now
say
or
slade
and
treat
me
in
every
way
more
as
if
i
were
an
equal
than
ever
they
did
before
the
change
said
i
may
be
due
to
the
fact
of
your
giving
evidence
of
possessing
some
means
men
are
very
apt
to
be
courteous
to
those
who
have
property
the
building
of
the
tavern
has
without
doubt
contributed
to
the
new
estimation
in
which
you
are
held
that
is
all
replied
the
landlord
it
is
because
i
am
keeping
a
good
tavern
and
thus
materially
advancing
the
interests
of
cedarville
that
some
of
our
best
people
look
at
me
with
different
eyes
advancing
the
interests
of
cedarville
in
what
way
i
did
not
apprehend
his
meaning
a
good
tavern
always
draws
people
to
a
place
while
a
miserable
old
of
an
affair
badly
kept
such
as
we
have
had
for
years
as
surely
repels
them
you
can
generally
tell
something
about
the
condition
of
a
town
by
looking
at
its
taverns
if
they
are
well
kept
and
doing
a
good
business
you
will
hardly
be
wrong
in
the
conclusion
that
the
place
is
thriving
why
already
since
i
built
and
opened
the
and
sheaf
property
has
advanced
over
twenty
per
cent
along
the
whole
street
and
not
less
than
five
new
houses
have
been
commenced
other
causes
besides
the
simple
opening
of
a
new
tavern
may
have
contributed
to
this
result
said
i
none
of
which
i
am
aware
i
was
talking
with
judge
hammond
only
yesterday
he
owns
a
great
deal
of
ground
on
the
street
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
building
and
opening
of
a
good
tavern
here
had
increased
the
value
of
his
property
at
least
five
thousand
dollars
he
said
moreover
that
he
thought
the
people
of
cedarville
ought
to
present
me
with
a
silver
pitcher
and
that
for
one
he
would
contribute
ten
dollars
for
that
purpose
the
ringing
of
the
supper
bell
interrupted
further
conversation
and
with
the
best
of
appetites
i
took
my
way
to
the
room
where
a
plentiful
meal
was
spread
as
i
entered
i
met
the
wife
of
simon
slade
just
passing
out
after
seeing
that
every
thing
was
in
order
i
had
not
observed
her
before
and
now
could
not
help
remarking
that
she
had
a
flushed
excited
countenance
as
if
she
had
been
over
a
hot
fire
and
was
both
worried
and
fatigued
and
there
was
moreover
a
peculiar
expression
of
the
mouth
never
observed
in
one
whose
mind
is
entirely
at
ease
an
expression
that
once
seen
is
never
forgotten
the
face
stamped
itself
instantly
on
my
memory
and
i
can
even
now
recall
it
with
almost
the
original
distinctness
how
strongly
it
contrasted
with
that
of
her
smiling
husband
who
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
his
table
with
an
air
of
conscious
importance
i
was
too
hungry
to
talk
much
and
so
found
greater
enjoyment
in
eating
than
in
conversation
the
landlord
had
a
more
chatty
guest
by
his
side
and
i
left
them
to
entertain
each
other
while
i
did
ample
justice
to
the
excellent
food
with
which
the
table
was
liberally
provided
after
supper
i
went
to
the
and
remained
there
until
the
lamps
were
lighted
a
newspaper
occupied
my
time
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
then
the
buzz
of
voices
from
the
adjoining
which
had
been
increasing
for
some
time
attracted
my
attention
and
i
went
in
there
to
see
and
hear
what
was
passing
the
first
person
upon
whom
my
eyes
rested
was
young
hammond
who
sat
talking
with
a
man
older
than
himself
by
several
years
at
a
glance
i
saw
that
this
man
could
only
associate
himself
with
willy
hammond
as
a
tempter
unscrupulous
selfishness
was
written
all
over
his
sinister
countenance
and
i
wondered
that
it
did
not
strike
every
one
as
it
did
me
with
instant
repulsion
there
could
not
be
i
felt
certain
any
common
ground
of
association
for
two
such
persons
but
the
dead
level
of
a
village
i
afterward
learned
during
the
evening
that
this
man
name
was
harvey
green
and
that
he
was
an
occasional
visitor
at
cedarville
remaining
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
at
a
time
as
appeared
to
suit
his
fancy
and
having
no
ostensible
business
or
special
acquaintance
with
anybody
in
the
village
there
is
one
thing
about
him
remarked
simon
slade
in
answering
some
question
that
i
put
in
reference
to
the
man
that
i
do
object
to
he
has
plenty
of
money
and
is
not
at
all
niggardly
in
spending
it
he
used
to
come
here
so
he
told
me
about
once
in
five
or
six
months
but
his
stay
at
the
miserably
kept
tavern
the
only
one
then
in
cedarville
was
so
uncomfortable
that
he
had
pretty
well
made
up
his
mind
never
to
visit
us
again
now
however
he
has
engaged
one
of
my
best
rooms
for
which
he
pays
me
by
the
year
and
i
am
to
charge
him
full
board
for
the
time
he
occupies
it
he
says
that
there
is
something
about
cedarville
that
always
attracts
him
and
that
his
health
is
better
while
here
than
it
is
anywhere
except
south
during
the
winter
season
he
never
leave
less
than
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
a
year
in
our
village
there
is
one
item
for
you
of
advantage
to
a
place
in
having
a
good
tavern
what
is
his
business
i
asked
is
he
engaged
in
any
trading
operations
the
landlord
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
slightly
mysterious
as
he
answered
i
never
inquire
about
the
business
of
a
guest
my
calling
is
to
entertain
strangers
if
they
are
pleased
with
my
house
and
pay
my
bills
on
presentation
i
have
no
right
to
seek
further
as
a
miller
i
never
asked
a
customer
whether
he
raised
bought
or
stole
his
wheat
it
was
my
business
to
grind
it
and
i
took
care
to
do
it
well
beyond
that
it
was
all
his
own
affair
and
so
it
will
be
in
my
new
calling
i
shall
mind
my
own
business
and
keep
my
own
place
besides
young
hammond
and
this
harvey
green
there
were
in
the
when
i
entered
four
others
besides
the
landlord
among
these
was
a
judge
lyman
so
he
was
addressed
a
man
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
who
had
a
few
weeks
before
received
the
democratic
nomination
for
member
of
congress
he
was
very
talkative
and
very
affable
and
soon
formed
a
kind
of
centre
of
attraction
to
the
circle
among
other
topics
of
conversation
that
came
up
was
the
new
tavern
introduced
by
the
landlord
in
whose
mind
it
was
very
naturally
the
uppermost
thought
the
only
wonder
to
me
is
said
judge
lyman
that
nobody
had
wit
enough
to
see
the
advantage
of
a
good
tavern
in
cedarville
ten
years
ago
or
enterprise
enough
to
start
one
i
give
our
friend
slade
the
credit
of
being
a
shrewd
man
and
mark
my
word
for
it
in
ten
years
from
he
will
be
the
richest
man
in
the
county
nonsense
ho
ho
simon
slade
laughed
outright
the
richest
man
you
forget
judge
hammond
no
not
even
judge
hammond
with
all
deference
for
our
clever
friend
willy
and
judge
lyman
smiled
pleasantly
on
the
young
man
if
he
gets
richer
somebody
will
be
poorer
the
individual
who
tittered
these
words
had
not
spoken
before
and
i
turned
to
look
at
him
more
closely
a
glance
showed
him
to
be
one
of
a
class
seen
in
all
a
poor
inebriate
with
the
inward
power
of
resistance
gone
conscious
of
having
no
man
respect
and
giving
respect
to
none
there
was
a
shrewd
twinkle
in
his
eyes
as
he
fixed
them
on
slade
that
gave
added
force
to
the
peculiar
tone
in
which
his
brief
but
telling
sentence
was
uttered
i
noticed
a
slight
contraction
on
the
landlord
ample
forehead
the
first
evidence
i
had
yet
seen
of
ruffled
feelings
the
remark
thrown
in
so
untimely
or
timely
some
will
say
and
with
a
kind
of
prophetic
malice
produced
a
temporary
pause
in
the
conversation
no
one
answered
or
questioned
the
intruder
who
i
could
perceive
silently
enjoyed
the
effect
of
his
words
but
soon
the
obstructed
current
ran
on
again
if
our
excellent
friend
slade
said
harvey
green
is
not
the
richest
man
in
cedarville
at
the
end
of
ten
years
he
will
at
least
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
having
made
his
town
richer
a
true
word
that
replied
judge
lyman
as
true
a
word
as
ever
was
spoken
what
a
place
this
has
been
until
within
the
last
few
months
all
vigorous
growth
had
stopped
and
we
were
actually
going
to
seed
and
the
graveyard
too
muttered
the
individual
who
had
before
disturbed
the
harmony
of
the
company
remarking
upon
the
closing
sentence
of
harvey
green
come
landlord
he
added
as
he
strode
across
to
the
bar
speaking
in
a
changed
reckless
sort
of
a
way
fix
me
up
a
good
hot
and
do
it
right
and
another
sixpence
toward
the
fortune
you
are
bound
to
make
it
the
last
one
left
not
a
copper
more
in
my
pockets
and
he
turned
them
with
a
air
i
send
it
to
keep
company
in
your
till
with
four
others
that
have
found
their
way
into
that
snug
place
since
morning
and
which
will
be
lonesome
without
their
little
friend
i
looked
at
simon
slade
his
eyes
rested
on
mine
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
sunk
beneath
my
earnest
gaze
i
saw
that
his
countenance
flushed
and
that
his
motions
were
slightly
confused
the
incident
it
was
plain
did
not
awaken
agreeable
thoughts
once
i
saw
his
hand
move
toward
the
sixpence
that
lay
upon
the
counter
but
whether
to
push
it
back
or
draw
it
toward
the
till
i
could
not
determine
the
was
in
due
time
ready
and
with
it
the
man
retired
to
a
table
across
the
room
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
the
tempting
beverage
as
he
did
so
the
landlord
quietly
swept
the
poor
unfortunate
last
sixpence
into
his
drawer
the
influence
of
this
strong
potation
was
to
render
the
man
a
little
more
talkative
to
the
free
conversation
passing
around
him
he
lent
an
attentive
ear
dropping
in
a
word
now
and
then
that
always
told
upon
the
company
like
a
blow
at
last
slade
lost
all
patience
with
him
and
said
a
little
fretfully
look
here
joe
morgan
if
you
will
be
pray
go
somewhere
else
and
not
interrupt
good
feeling
among
gentlemen
got
my
last
sixpence
retorted
joe
turning
his
pockets
again
no
more
use
for
me
here
that
the
way
of
the
world
how
apt
a
scholar
is
our
good
friend
dustycoat
in
this
new
school
well
he
was
a
good
miller
no
one
ever
disputed
that
and
it
plain
to
see
that
he
is
going
to
make
a
good
landlord
i
thought
his
heart
was
a
little
too
soft
but
the
indurating
process
has
begun
and
in
less
than
ten
years
if
it
is
as
hard
as
one
of
his
old
joe
morgan
is
no
prophet
oh
you
need
knit
your
brows
so
friend
simon
we
old
friends
and
friends
are
privileged
to
speak
plain
i
wish
you
go
home
you
not
yourself
tonight
said
the
landlord
a
little
coaxingly
for
he
saw
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
quarreling
with
morgan
maybe
my
heart
is
growing
harder
he
added
with
affected
and
it
is
time
perhaps
one
of
my
weaknesses
i
have
heard
even
you
say
was
being
too
no
danger
of
that
now
retorted
joe
morgan
i
known
a
good
many
landlords
in
my
time
but
ca
remember
one
that
was
troubled
with
the
disease
that
once
afflicted
you
just
at
this
moment
the
outer
door
was
pushed
open
with
a
slow
hesitating
motion
then
a
little
pale
face
peered
in
and
a
pair
of
soft
blue
eyes
went
searching
about
the
room
conversation
was
instantly
hushed
and
every
face
excited
with
interest
turned
toward
the
child
who
had
now
stepped
through
the
door
she
was
not
over
ten
years
of
age
but
it
moved
the
heart
to
look
upon
the
saddened
expression
of
her
young
countenance
and
the
forced
bravery
therein
that
scarcely
overcame
the
native
timidity
so
touchingly
visible
father
i
have
never
heard
this
word
spoken
in
a
voice
that
sent
such
a
thrill
along
every
nerve
it
was
full
of
sorrowful
love
full
of
a
tender
concern
that
had
its
origin
too
deep
for
the
heart
of
a
child
as
she
spoke
the
little
one
sprang
across
the
room
and
laying
her
hands
upon
the
arm
of
joe
morgan
lifted
her
eyes
that
were
ready
to
gush
over
with
tears
to
his
face
come
father
wo
you
come
home
i
hear
that
low
pleading
voice
even
now
and
my
heart
gives
a
quicker
throb
poor
child
darkly
shadowed
was
the
sky
that
bent
gloomily
over
thy
young
life
morgan
arose
and
suffered
the
child
to
lead
him
from
the
room
he
seemed
passive
in
her
hands
i
noticed
that
he
thrust
his
fingers
nervously
into
his
pocket
and
that
a
troubled
look
went
over
his
face
as
they
were
withdrawn
his
last
sixpence
was
in
the
till
of
simon
slade
the
first
man
who
spoke
was
harvey
green
and
this
not
for
a
minute
after
the
father
and
his
child
had
vanished
through
the
door
if
i
was
in
your
place
landlord
his
voice
was
cold
and
unfeeling
i
pitch
that
fellow
out
of
the
the
next
time
he
stepped
through
the
door
he
no
business
here
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
he
does
know
how
to
behave
himself
there
no
telling
how
much
a
vagabond
like
him
injures
a
respectable
house
i
wish
he
would
stay
away
said
simon
with
a
perplexed
air
i
make
him
stay
away
answered
green
that
may
be
easier
said
than
done
remarked
judge
lyman
our
friend
keeps
a
and
ca
just
say
who
shall
or
shall
not
come
into
it
but
such
a
fellow
has
no
business
here
he
a
sot
if
i
kept
a
tavern
i
refuse
to
sell
him
liquor
that
you
might
do
said
judge
lyman
and
i
presume
your
hint
will
not
be
lost
on
our
friend
slade
he
will
have
liquor
so
long
as
he
can
get
a
cent
to
buy
it
with
remarked
one
of
the
company
and
i
do
see
why
our
landlord
here
who
has
gone
to
so
much
expense
to
fit
up
a
tavern
should
have
the
sale
of
it
as
well
as
anybody
else
joe
talks
a
little
freely
sometimes
but
no
one
can
say
that
he
is
quarrelsome
you
got
to
take
him
as
he
is
that
all
i
am
one
retorted
harvey
green
with
a
slightly
ruffled
manner
who
is
never
disposed
to
take
people
as
they
are
when
they
choose
to
render
themselves
disagreeable
if
i
was
slade
as
i
remarked
in
the
beginning
i
pitch
that
fellow
into
the
road
the
next
time
he
put
his
foot
over
my
door
step
not
if
i
were
present
remarked
the
other
coolly
green
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
and
i
saw
from
the
flash
of
his
eyes
that
he
was
a
man
of
evil
passions
moving
a
pace
or
two
in
the
direction
of
the
other
he
said
sharply
what
is
that
sir
the
individual
against
whom
his
anger
was
so
suddenly
aroused
was
dressed
plainly
and
had
the
appearance
of
a
working
man
he
was
stout
and
muscular
i
presume
you
heard
my
words
they
were
spoken
distinctly
he
replied
not
moving
from
where
he
sat
nor
seeming
to
be
in
the
least
disturbed
but
there
was
a
cool
defiance
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
and
in
the
steady
look
of
his
eyes
you
an
impertinent
fellow
and
i
half
tempted
to
chastise
you
green
had
scarcely
finished
the
sentence
ere
he
was
lying
full
length
upon
the
floor
the
other
had
sprung
upon
him
like
a
tiger
and
with
one
blow
from
his
heavy
fist
struck
him
down
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
for
a
moment
or
two
green
lay
stunned
and
bewildered
then
starting
up
with
a
savage
cry
that
sounded
more
bestial
than
human
he
drew
a
long
knife
from
a
concealed
sheath
and
attempted
to
stab
his
assailant
but
the
murderous
purpose
was
not
accomplished
for
the
other
man
who
had
superior
strength
and
coolness
saw
the
design
and
with
a
well
directed
blow
almost
broke
the
arm
of
green
causing
the
knife
to
leave
his
hand
and
glide
far
across
the
room
i
half
tempted
to
wring
your
neck
off
exclaimed
the
man
whose
name
was
lyon
now
much
excited
and
seizing
green
by
the
throat
he
strangled
him
until
his
face
grew
black
draw
a
knife
on
me
ha
you
murdering
villain
and
he
gripped
him
tighter
judge
lyman
and
the
landlord
now
interfered
and
rescued
green
from
the
hands
of
his
fully
aroused
antagonist
for
some
time
they
stood
growling
at
each
other
like
two
parted
dogs
struggling
to
get
free
in
order
to
renew
the
conflict
but
gradually
cooled
off
in
a
little
while
judge
lyman
drew
green
aside
and
the
two
men
left
the
to
other
in
the
door
as
they
were
retiring
the
former
slightly
nodded
to
willy
hammond
who
soon
followed
them
going
into
the
sitting
room
and
from
thence
as
i
could
perceive
upstairs
to
an
apartment
above
not
after
much
good
i
heard
lyon
mutter
to
himself
if
judge
hammond
do
look
a
little
closer
after
that
boy
of
his
he
be
sorry
for
it
that
all
who
is
this
green
i
asked
of
lyon
finding
myself
alone
with
him
in
the
soon
after
a
blackleg
i
take
it
was
his
unhesitating
answer
does
judge
lyman
suspect
his
real
character
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
i
would
be
afraid
to
bet
ten
dollars
that
if
you
could
look
in
upon
them
now
you
would
find
cards
in
their
hands
what
a
school
and
what
teachers
for
the
youth
who
just
went
with
them
i
could
not
help
remarking
willy
hammond
yes
you
may
well
say
that
what
can
his
father
be
thinking
about
to
leave
him
exposed
to
such
influences
he
one
of
the
few
who
are
in
raptures
about
this
tavern
because
its
erection
has
slightly
increased
the
value
of
his
property
about
here
but
if
he
is
not
the
loser
of
fifty
per
cent
for
every
one
gained
before
ten
years
go
by
i
very
much
in
error
how
so
it
will
prove
i
fear
the
open
door
to
ruin
to
his
son
that
bad
said
i
bad
it
is
awful
to
think
of
there
is
not
a
finer
young
man
in
the
country
nor
one
with
better
mind
and
heart
than
willy
hammond
so
much
the
sadder
will
be
his
destruction
ah
sir
this
is
a
curse
to
any
place
but
i
thought
just
now
that
you
spoke
in
favor
of
letting
even
the
poor
drunkard
money
go
into
the
landlord
till
in
order
to
encourage
his
commendable
enterprise
in
opening
so
good
a
tavern
we
all
speak
with
covert
irony
sometimes
answered
the
man
as
i
did
then
poor
joe
morgan
he
is
an
old
and
early
friend
of
simon
slade
they
were
boys
together
and
worked
as
millers
under
the
same
roof
for
many
years
in
fact
joe
father
owned
the
mill
and
the
two
learned
their
trade
with
him
when
old
morgan
died
the
mill
came
into
hands
it
was
in
rather
a
condition
and
joe
went
in
debt
for
some
pretty
thorough
repairs
and
additions
of
machinery
by
and
by
simon
slade
who
was
hired
by
joe
to
run
the
mill
received
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
at
the
death
of
an
aunt
this
sum
enabled
him
to
buy
a
share
in
the
mill
which
morgan
was
very
glad
to
sell
in
order
to
get
clear
of
his
debt
time
passed
on
and
joe
left
his
milling
interest
almost
entirely
in
the
care
of
slade
who
it
must
be
said
in
his
favor
did
not
neglect
the
business
but
it
somehow
happened
i
will
not
say
unfairly
that
at
the
end
of
ten
years
joe
morgan
no
longer
owned
a
share
in
the
mill
the
whole
property
was
in
the
hands
of
slade
people
did
not
much
wonder
at
this
for
while
slade
was
always
to
be
found
at
the
mill
industrious
active
and
attentive
to
customers
morgan
was
rarely
seen
on
the
premises
you
would
oftener
find
him
in
the
woods
with
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
or
sitting
by
a
trout
brook
or
lounging
at
the
tavern
and
yet
everybody
liked
joe
for
he
was
companionable
and
very
he
would
say
sharp
things
sometimes
when
people
manifested
little
meannesses
but
there
was
so
much
honey
in
his
gall
that
bitterness
rarely
predominated
a
year
or
two
before
his
ownership
in
the
mill
ceased
morgan
married
one
of
the
sweetest
girls
in
our
town
fanny
ellis
that
was
her
name
and
she
could
have
had
her
pick
of
the
young
men
everybody
affected
to
wonder
at
her
choice
and
yet
nobody
really
did
wonder
for
joe
was
an
attractive
young
man
take
him
as
you
would
and
just
the
one
to
win
the
heart
of
a
girl
like
fanny
what
if
he
had
been
seen
now
and
then
a
little
the
worse
for
drink
what
if
he
showed
more
fondness
for
pleasure
than
for
business
fanny
did
not
look
into
the
future
with
doubt
or
fear
she
believed
that
her
love
was
strong
enough
to
win
him
from
all
evil
allurements
and
as
for
this
world
goods
they
were
matters
in
which
her
maiden
fancies
rarely
busied
themselves
well
dark
days
came
for
her
poor
soul
and
yet
in
all
the
darkness
of
her
earthly
lot
she
has
never
it
is
said
been
anything
but
a
loving
forbearing
wife
to
morgan
and
he
fallen
as
he
is
and
powerless
in
the
grasp
of
the
monster
intemperance
has
never
i
am
sure
hurt
her
with
a
cruel
word
had
he
added
these
her
heart
would
long
ere
this
have
broken
poor
joe
morgan
poor
fanny
oh
what
a
curse
is
this
drink
the
man
warming
with
his
theme
had
spoken
with
an
eloquence
i
had
not
expected
from
his
lips
slightly
overmastered
by
his
feelings
he
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
added
it
was
unfortunate
for
joe
at
least
that
slade
sold
his
mill
and
became
a
for
joe
had
a
sure
berth
and
wages
regularly
paid
he
did
always
stick
to
his
work
but
would
go
off
on
a
spree
every
now
and
then
but
slade
bore
with
all
this
and
worked
harder
himself
to
make
up
for
his
hand
shortcoming
and
no
matter
what
deficiency
the
little
at
home
might
show
fanny
morgan
never
found
her
meal
barrel
empty
without
knowing
where
to
get
it
replenished
but
after
slade
sold
his
mill
a
sad
change
took
place
the
new
owner
was
little
disposed
to
pay
wages
to
a
hand
who
would
not
give
him
all
his
time
during
working
hours
and
in
less
than
two
weeks
from
the
day
he
took
possession
morgan
was
discharged
since
then
he
has
been
working
about
at
one
odd
job
and
another
earning
scarcely
enough
to
buy
the
liquor
it
requires
to
feed
the
inordinate
thirst
that
is
consuming
him
i
am
not
disposed
to
blame
simon
slade
for
the
of
morgan
but
here
is
a
simple
fact
in
the
case
if
he
had
kept
on
at
the
useful
calling
of
a
miller
he
would
have
saved
this
man
family
from
want
suffering
and
a
lower
deep
of
misery
than
that
into
which
they
have
already
fallen
i
merely
state
it
and
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
it
is
one
of
the
many
facts
on
the
other
side
of
this
tavern
question
which
it
will
do
no
harm
to
mention
i
have
noted
a
good
many
facts
besides
and
one
is
that
before
slade
opened
the
and
sheaf
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
save
his
early
friend
from
the
curse
of
intemperance
now
he
has
become
his
tempter
heretofore
it
was
his
hand
that
provided
the
means
for
his
family
to
live
in
some
small
degree
of
comfort
now
he
takes
the
poor
pittance
the
wretched
man
earns
and
dropping
it
in
his
till
forgets
the
wife
and
children
at
home
who
are
hungry
for
the
bread
this
money
should
have
purchased
joe
morgan
fallen
as
he
is
sir
is
no
fool
his
mind
sees
quickly
yet
and
he
rarely
utters
a
sentiment
that
is
not
full
of
meaning
when
he
spoke
of
blade
heart
growing
as
hard
in
ten
years
as
one
of
his
old
he
was
not
uttering
words
at
random
nor
merely
indulging
in
a
harsh
sentiment
little
caring
whether
it
were
closely
applicable
or
not
that
the
indurating
process
had
begun
he
alas
was
too
sadly
conscious
the
landlord
had
been
absent
from
the
room
for
some
time
he
left
soon
after
judge
lyman
harvey
green
and
willy
hammond
withdrew
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
during
the
evening
his
son
frank
was
left
to
attend
at
the
bar
no
very
hard
task
for
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
called
in
to
drink
from
the
time
morgan
left
until
the
bar
was
closed
while
lyon
was
giving
me
the
brief
history
just
recorded
i
noticed
a
little
incident
that
caused
a
troubled
feeling
to
pervade
my
mind
after
a
man
for
whom
the
landlord
son
had
prepared
a
fancy
drink
had
nearly
emptied
his
glass
he
set
it
down
upon
the
counter
and
went
out
a
tablespoonful
or
two
remained
in
the
glass
and
i
noticed
frank
after
smelling
at
it
two
or
three
times
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
sip
the
sweetened
liquor
the
flavor
proved
agreeable
for
after
tasting
it
he
raised
the
glass
again
and
drained
every
drop
frank
i
heard
a
low
voice
in
a
warning
tone
pronounce
the
name
and
glancing
toward
a
door
partly
open
that
led
from
the
inside
of
the
bar
to
the
yard
i
saw
the
face
of
slade
it
had
the
same
troubled
expression
i
had
noticed
before
but
now
blended
with
anxiety
the
boy
went
out
at
the
call
of
his
mother
and
when
a
new
customer
entered
i
noticed
that
flora
the
daughter
came
in
to
wait
upon
him
i
noticed
too
that
while
she
poured
out
the
liquor
there
was
a
heightened
color
on
her
face
in
which
i
fancied
that
i
saw
a
tinge
of
shame
it
is
certain
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
gracious
to
the
person
on
whom
she
was
waiting
and
that
there
was
little
heart
in
her
manner
of
performing
the
task
ten
found
me
alone
and
musing
in
the
barroom
over
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
of
all
the
incidents
that
of
the
entrance
of
joe
morgan
child
kept
the
most
prominent
place
in
my
thoughts
the
picture
of
that
mournful
little
face
was
ever
before
me
and
i
seemed
all
the
while
to
hear
the
word
father
uttered
so
touchingly
and
yet
with
such
a
world
of
childish
tenderness
and
the
man
who
would
have
opposed
the
most
stubborn
resistance
to
his
had
they
sought
to
force
him
from
the
room
going
passively
almost
meekly
out
led
by
that
little
child
i
could
not
for
a
time
turn
my
thoughts
from
the
image
thereof
and
then
thought
bore
me
to
the
wretched
home
back
to
which
the
gentle
loving
child
had
taken
her
father
and
my
heart
grew
faint
in
me
as
imagination
busied
itself
with
all
the
misery
there
and
willy
hammond
the
little
that
i
had
heard
and
seen
of
him
greatly
interested
me
in
his
favor
ah
upon
what
dangerous
ground
was
he
treading
how
many
pitfalls
awaited
his
feet
how
near
they
were
to
the
brink
of
a
fearful
precipice
down
which
to
fall
was
certain
destruction
how
beautiful
had
been
his
how
fair
the
opening
day
of
his
existence
alas
the
clouds
were
gathering
already
and
the
low
rumble
of
the
distant
thunder
presaged
the
coming
of
a
fearful
tempest
was
there
none
to
warn
him
of
the
danger
alas
all
might
now
come
too
late
for
so
few
who
enter
the
path
in
which
his
steps
were
treading
will
hearken
to
friendly
counsel
or
heed
the
solemn
warning
where
was
he
now
this
question
recurred
over
and
over
again
he
had
left
the
with
judge
lyman
and
green
early
in
the
evening
and
had
not
made
his
appearance
since
who
and
what
was
green
and
judge
lyman
was
he
a
man
of
principle
one
with
whom
it
was
safe
to
trust
a
youth
like
willy
hammond
while
i
mused
thus
the
door
opened
and
a
man
past
the
prime
of
life
with
a
somewhat
florid
face
which
gave
a
strong
relief
to
the
gray
almost
white
hair
that
suffered
to
grow
freely
was
pushed
back
and
lay
in
heavy
masses
on
his
coat
collar
entered
with
a
hasty
step
he
was
almost
venerable
in
appearance
yet
there
was
in
his
dark
quick
eyes
the
brightness
of
unquenched
loves
the
fires
of
which
were
kindled
at
the
altars
of
selfishness
and
sensuality
this
i
saw
at
a
glance
there
was
a
look
of
concern
on
his
face
as
he
threw
his
eyes
around
the
and
he
seemed
disappointed
i
thought
at
finding
it
empty
is
simon
slade
here
as
i
answered
in
the
negative
slade
entered
through
the
door
that
opened
from
the
yard
and
stood
behind
the
counter
ah
slade
good
evening
madam
he
said
good
evening
judge
hammond
is
your
husband
at
home
i
believe
he
is
answered
slade
i
think
he
is
somewhere
about
the
house
ask
him
to
step
here
will
you
slade
went
out
nearly
five
minutes
went
by
during
which
time
judge
hammond
paced
the
floor
of
the
uneasily
then
the
landlord
made
his
appearance
the
free
open
manly
expression
of
his
countenance
which
i
had
remarked
on
alighting
from
the
stage
in
the
afternoon
was
gone
i
noticed
at
once
the
change
for
it
was
striking
he
did
not
look
steadily
into
the
face
of
judge
hammond
who
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
if
his
son
had
been
there
during
the
evening
he
was
here
said
slade
when
he
came
in
some
time
after
dark
and
stayed
maybe
an
hour
and
has
been
here
since
it
nearly
two
hours
since
he
left
the
replied
the
landlord
judge
hammond
seemed
perplexed
there
was
a
degree
of
evasion
in
slade
manner
that
he
could
hardly
help
noticing
to
me
it
was
all
apparent
for
i
had
lively
suspicions
that
made
my
observation
acute
judge
hammond
crossed
his
arms
behind
him
and
took
three
or
four
strides
about
the
floor
was
judge
lyman
here
he
then
asked
he
was
answered
slade
did
he
and
willy
go
out
together
the
question
seemed
an
unexpected
one
for
the
landlord
slade
appeared
slightly
confused
and
did
not
answer
promptly
i
i
rather
think
they
did
he
said
after
a
brief
hesitation
ah
well
perhaps
he
is
at
judge
lyman
i
will
call
over
there
and
judge
hammond
left
the
would
you
like
to
retire
sir
said
the
landlord
now
turning
to
me
with
a
forced
smile
i
saw
that
it
was
forced
if
you
please
i
answered
he
lit
a
candle
and
conducted
me
to
my
room
where
overwearied
with
the
day
exertion
i
soon
fell
asleep
and
did
not
awake
until
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
into
my
windows
i
remained
at
the
village
a
portion
of
the
day
but
saw
nothing
of
the
parties
in
whom
the
incidents
of
the
previous
evening
had
awakened
a
lively
interest
at
four
i
left
in
the
stage
and
did
not
visit
cedarville
again
for
a
year
night
the
second
the
changes
of
a
year
a
cordial
grasp
of
the
hand
and
a
few
words
of
hearty
welcome
greeted
me
as
i
alighted
from
the
stage
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
on
my
next
visit
to
cedarville
at
the
first
glance
i
saw
no
change
in
the
countenance
manner
or
general
bearing
of
simon
slade
the
landlord
with
him
the
year
seemed
to
have
passed
like
a
pleasant
summer
day
his
face
was
round
and
full
and
rosy
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
that
good
humor
which
flows
from
intense
everything
about
him
seemed
to
say
all
with
myself
and
the
world
i
had
scarcely
expected
this
from
what
i
saw
during
my
last
brief
sojourn
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
the
inference
was
natural
that
elements
had
been
called
into
activity
which
must
produce
changes
adverse
to
those
pleasant
states
of
mind
that
threw
an
almost
perpetual
sunshine
over
the
landlord
countenance
how
many
hundreds
of
times
had
i
thought
of
tom
morgan
and
willy
hammond
of
frank
and
the
temptations
to
which
a
exposed
him
the
heart
of
slade
must
indeed
be
as
hard
as
one
of
his
old
if
he
could
remain
an
unmoved
witness
of
the
corruption
and
degradation
of
these
my
fears
have
outrun
the
actual
progress
of
things
said
i
to
myself
with
a
sense
of
relief
as
i
mused
alone
in
the
still
neatly
arranged
after
the
landlord
who
sat
and
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
had
left
me
there
is
i
am
willing
to
believe
a
basis
of
good
in
this
man
character
which
has
led
him
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
the
more
palpable
evils
that
ever
attach
themselves
to
a
house
of
public
entertainment
he
had
but
entered
on
the
business
last
year
there
was
much
to
be
learned
pondered
and
corrected
experience
i
doubt
not
has
led
to
many
important
changes
in
the
manner
of
conducting
the
establishment
and
especially
in
what
pertains
to
the
bar
as
i
thought
thus
my
eyes
glanced
through
the
door
and
rested
on
the
face
of
simon
slade
he
was
standing
behind
his
bar
evidently
alone
in
the
room
with
his
head
bent
in
a
musing
attitude
at
first
i
was
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
the
singularly
changed
countenance
two
deep
perpendicular
seams
lay
sharply
defined
on
his
forehead
the
arch
of
his
eyebrows
was
gone
and
from
each
corner
of
his
compressed
lips
lines
were
seen
reaching
to
the
chin
blending
with
a
slightly
troubled
expression
was
a
strongly
marked
selfishness
evidently
brooding
over
the
consummation
of
its
purpose
for
some
moments
i
sat
gazing
on
his
face
half
doubting
at
times
if
it
were
really
that
of
simon
slade
suddenly
a
gleam
flashed
over
it
an
ejaculation
was
uttered
and
one
clenched
hand
brought
down
with
a
sharp
stroke
into
the
open
palm
of
the
other
the
landlord
mind
had
reached
a
conclusion
and
was
resolved
upon
action
there
were
no
warm
rays
in
the
gleam
of
light
that
irradiated
his
countenance
at
least
none
for
my
heart
which
felt
under
them
an
almost
icy
coldness
just
the
man
i
was
thinking
about
i
heard
the
landlord
say
as
some
one
entered
the
bar
while
his
whole
manner
underwent
a
sudden
change
the
old
saying
is
true
was
answered
in
a
voice
the
tones
of
which
were
familiar
to
my
ears
thinking
of
the
old
harry
said
slade
yes
true
literally
in
the
present
case
i
heard
the
landlord
remark
though
in
a
much
lower
tone
for
if
you
are
not
the
devil
himself
you
ca
be
farther
removed
than
a
second
cousin
a
low
gurgling
laugh
met
this
little
sally
there
was
something
in
it
so
unlike
a
human
laugh
that
it
caused
my
blood
to
trickle
for
a
moment
coldly
along
my
veins
i
heard
nothing
more
except
the
murmur
of
voices
in
the
bar
for
a
hand
shut
the
partly
opened
door
that
led
from
the
sitting
room
whose
was
that
voice
i
recalled
its
tones
and
tried
to
fix
in
my
thought
the
person
to
whom
it
belonged
but
was
unable
to
do
so
i
was
not
very
long
in
doubt
for
on
stepping
out
on
the
porch
in
front
of
the
tavern
the
well
remembered
face
of
harvey
green
presented
itself
he
stood
in
the
door
and
was
talking
earnestly
to
slade
whose
back
was
toward
me
i
saw
that
he
recognized
me
although
i
had
not
passed
a
word
with
him
on
the
occasion
of
my
former
visit
and
there
was
a
lighting
up
of
his
countenance
as
if
about
to
speak
but
i
withdrew
my
eyes
from
his
face
to
avoid
the
unwelcome
greeting
when
i
looked
at
him
again
i
saw
that
he
was
regarding
me
with
a
sinister
glance
which
was
instantly
withdrawn
in
what
broad
black
characters
was
the
word
tempter
written
on
his
face
how
was
it
possible
for
anyone
to
look
thereon
and
not
read
the
warning
inscription
soon
after
he
withdrew
into
the
and
the
landlord
came
and
took
a
seat
near
me
on
the
porch
how
is
the
and
sheaf
coming
on
i
inquired
first
rate
was
the
answer
first
rate
as
well
as
you
expected
better
satisfied
with
your
experiment
perfectly
could
get
me
back
to
the
rumbling
old
mill
again
if
you
were
to
make
me
a
present
of
it
what
of
the
mill
i
asked
how
does
the
new
owner
come
on
about
as
i
thought
it
would
be
not
doing
very
well
how
could
it
be
expected
when
he
did
know
enough
of
the
milling
business
to
grind
a
bushel
of
wheat
right
he
lost
half
of
the
custom
i
transferred
to
him
in
less
than
three
months
then
he
broke
his
main
shaft
and
it
took
over
three
weeks
to
get
in
a
new
one
half
of
his
remaining
customers
discovered
by
this
time
that
they
could
get
far
better
meal
from
their
grain
at
harwood
mill
near
lynwood
and
so
did
not
care
to
trouble
him
any
more
the
upshot
of
the
whole
matter
is
he
broke
down
next
and
had
to
sell
the
mill
at
a
heavy
loss
who
has
it
now
judge
hammond
is
the
purchaser
he
is
going
to
rent
it
i
suppose
no
i
believe
he
means
to
turn
it
into
some
kind
of
a
factory
and
i
rather
think
will
connect
therewith
a
distillery
this
is
a
fine
country
as
you
know
if
he
does
set
up
a
distillery
he
make
a
fine
thing
of
it
grain
has
been
too
low
in
this
section
for
some
years
this
all
the
farmers
have
felt
and
they
are
very
much
pleased
at
the
idea
it
will
help
them
wonderfully
i
always
thought
my
mill
a
great
thing
for
the
farmers
but
what
i
did
for
them
was
a
mere
song
compared
to
the
advantage
of
an
extensive
distillery
judge
hammond
is
one
of
your
richest
men
yes
the
richest
in
the
county
and
what
is
more
he
a
shrewd
man
and
knows
how
to
multiply
his
riches
how
is
his
son
willy
coming
on
oh
the
landlord
eyes
fell
under
the
searching
look
i
bent
upon
him
how
old
is
he
now
just
twenty
a
critical
age
i
remarked
so
people
say
but
i
did
find
it
so
answered
slade
a
little
distantly
the
impulses
within
and
the
temptations
without
are
the
measure
of
its
dangers
at
his
age
you
were
no
doubt
daily
employed
at
hard
work
i
was
and
no
mistake
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
are
indebted
to
useful
work
occupying
many
hours
through
each
day
and
leaving
them
with
wearied
bodies
at
night
for
their
safe
passage
from
yielding
youth
to
firm
resisting
manhood
it
might
not
be
with
you
as
it
is
now
had
leisure
and
freedom
to
go
in
and
out
when
you
pleased
been
offered
at
the
age
of
nineteen
i
ca
tell
as
to
that
said
the
landlord
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
i
do
see
that
willy
hammond
is
in
any
especial
danger
he
is
a
young
man
with
many
admirable
qualities
is
generous
almost
to
a
fault
but
has
good
common
sense
and
wit
enough
i
take
it
to
keep
out
of
harm
way
a
man
passing
the
house
at
the
moment
gave
simon
slade
an
opportunity
to
break
off
a
conversation
that
was
not
i
could
see
altogether
agreeable
as
he
left
me
i
arose
and
stepped
into
the
frank
the
landlord
son
was
behind
the
bar
he
had
grown
considerably
in
the
year
and
from
a
rather
delicate
boy
to
a
stout
bold
lad
his
face
was
rounder
and
had
a
gross
sensual
expression
that
showed
itself
particularly
about
the
mouth
the
man
green
was
standing
beside
the
bar
talking
to
him
and
i
noticed
that
frank
laughed
heartily
at
some
low
half
obscene
remarks
that
he
was
making
in
the
midst
of
these
flora
the
sister
of
frank
a
really
beautiful
girl
came
in
to
get
something
from
the
bar
green
spoke
to
her
familiarly
and
flora
answered
him
with
a
perceptibly
heightening
color
i
glanced
toward
frank
half
expecting
to
see
an
indignant
flush
on
his
young
face
but
no
he
looked
on
with
a
smile
ah
thought
i
have
the
boy
pure
impulses
so
soon
died
out
in
this
fatal
atmosphere
can
he
bear
to
see
those
evil
eyes
he
knows
they
are
evil
rest
upon
the
face
of
his
sister
or
to
hear
those
lips
only
a
moment
since
polluted
with
vile
words
address
her
with
the
familiarity
of
a
friend
fine
girl
that
sister
of
yours
frank
fine
girl
said
green
after
flora
had
withdrawn
speaking
of
her
with
about
as
much
respect
in
his
voice
as
if
he
were
praising
a
fleet
racer
or
a
favorite
hound
the
boy
smiled
with
a
pleased
air
i
must
try
and
find
her
a
good
husband
frank
i
wonder
if
she
would
have
me
you
better
ask
her
said
the
boy
laughing
i
would
if
i
thought
there
was
any
chance
for
me
nothing
like
trying
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
returned
frank
more
with
the
air
of
a
man
than
a
boy
how
fast
he
was
growing
old
a
banter
by
george
exclaimed
green
slapping
his
hands
together
you
a
great
boy
frank
a
great
boy
i
shall
have
to
talk
to
your
father
about
you
coming
on
too
fast
have
to
be
put
back
in
your
lessons
hey
and
green
winked
at
the
boy
and
shook
his
finger
at
him
frank
laughed
in
a
pleased
way
as
he
replied
i
guess
i
do
i
guess
you
will
said
green
as
satisfied
with
his
colloquy
he
turned
off
and
left
the
have
something
to
drink
sir
inquired
frank
addressing
me
in
a
bold
free
way
i
shook
my
head
here
a
newspaper
he
added
i
took
the
paper
and
sat
down
not
to
read
but
to
observe
two
or
three
men
soon
came
in
and
spoke
in
a
very
familiar
way
to
frank
who
was
presently
busy
setting
out
the
liquors
they
had
called
for
their
conversation
interlarded
with
much
that
was
profane
and
vulgar
was
of
horses
gunning
and
the
like
to
all
of
which
the
young
lent
an
attentive
ear
putting
in
a
word
now
and
then
and
showing
an
intelligence
in
such
matters
quite
beyond
his
age
in
the
midst
thereof
slade
made
his
appearance
his
presence
caused
a
marked
change
in
frank
who
retired
from
his
place
among
the
men
a
step
or
two
outside
of
the
bar
and
did
not
make
a
remark
while
his
father
remained
it
was
plain
from
this
that
slade
was
not
only
aware
of
frank
dangerous
precocity
but
had
already
marked
his
forwardness
by
rebuke
so
far
all
that
i
had
seen
and
heard
impressed
me
unfavorably
notwithstanding
the
declaration
of
simon
slade
that
everything
about
the
sickle
and
sheaf
was
coming
on
and
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
experiment
why
even
if
the
man
had
gained
in
money
fifty
thousand
dollars
by
in
a
year
he
had
lost
a
jewel
in
the
innocence
of
his
boy
that
was
beyond
all
valuation
perfectly
satisfied
impossible
he
was
not
perfectly
satisfied
how
could
he
be
the
look
thrown
upon
frank
when
he
entered
the
and
saw
him
hale
fellow
well
met
with
three
or
four
idle
profane
drinking
customers
contradicted
that
assertion
after
supper
i
took
a
seat
in
the
to
see
how
life
moved
on
in
that
place
of
rendezvous
for
the
of
cedarville
interest
enough
in
the
characters
i
had
met
there
a
year
before
remained
for
me
to
choose
this
way
of
spending
the
time
instead
of
visiting
at
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
had
kindly
invited
me
to
pass
an
evening
with
his
family
the
custom
i
soon
found
had
largely
increased
in
a
year
it
now
required
for
a
good
part
of
the
time
the
active
services
of
both
the
landlord
and
his
son
to
meet
the
calls
for
liquor
what
pained
me
most
was
to
see
the
large
number
of
lads
and
young
men
who
came
in
to
lounge
and
drink
and
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
whose
face
did
not
show
marks
of
sensuality
or
whose
language
was
not
marred
by
obscenity
profanity
or
vulgar
slang
the
subjects
of
conversation
were
varied
enough
though
politics
was
the
most
prominent
in
regard
to
politics
i
heard
nothing
in
the
least
instructive
but
only
abuse
of
individuals
and
dogmatism
on
public
measures
they
were
all
exceedingly
confident
in
assertion
but
i
listened
in
vain
for
exposition
or
even
for
demonstrative
facts
he
who
asseverated
in
the
most
positive
manner
and
swore
the
hardest
carried
the
day
in
the
petty
contests
i
noticed
early
in
the
evening
and
at
a
time
when
all
the
inmates
of
the
room
were
in
the
best
possible
humor
with
themselves
the
entrance
of
an
elderly
man
on
whose
face
i
instantly
read
a
deep
concern
it
was
one
of
those
mild
yet
strongly
marked
faces
that
strike
you
at
a
glance
the
forehead
was
broad
the
eyes
large
and
far
back
in
their
sockets
the
lips
full
but
firm
you
saw
evidences
of
a
strong
but
character
as
he
came
in
i
noticed
a
look
of
intelligence
pass
from
one
to
another
and
then
the
eyes
of
two
or
three
were
fixed
upon
a
young
man
who
was
seated
not
far
from
me
with
his
back
to
the
entrance
playing
at
dominoes
he
had
a
glass
of
ale
by
his
side
the
old
man
searched
about
the
room
for
some
moments
before
his
glance
rested
upon
the
individual
i
have
mentioned
my
eyes
were
full
upon
his
face
as
he
advanced
toward
him
as
yet
unseen
upon
it
was
not
a
sign
of
angry
excitement
but
a
most
touching
sorrow
edward
he
said
as
he
laid
his
hand
gently
on
the
young
shoulder
the
latter
started
at
the
voice
and
crimsoned
deeply
a
few
moments
he
sat
irresolute
edward
my
son
it
would
have
been
a
cold
hard
heart
indeed
that
softened
not
under
the
melting
tenderness
of
these
tones
the
call
was
irresistible
and
obedience
a
necessity
the
powers
of
evil
had
yet
too
feeble
a
grasp
on
the
young
man
heart
to
hold
him
in
thrall
rising
with
a
manner
and
with
a
shamefacedness
that
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
he
retired
as
quietly
as
possible
the
notice
of
only
a
few
in
the
was
attracted
by
the
incident
i
can
tell
you
what
i
heard
the
individual
with
whom
the
young
man
had
been
playing
at
dominoes
remark
himself
not
twenty
years
of
age
if
my
old
man
were
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
this
way
sneaking
around
after
me
in
get
only
his
trouble
for
his
pains
i
like
to
see
him
try
it
though
there
be
a
nice
time
of
it
i
guess
would
i
creep
off
with
him
as
meek
as
a
lamb
ho
ho
who
is
that
old
gentleman
who
came
in
just
now
i
inquired
of
the
person
who
thus
commented
on
the
incident
which
had
just
occurred
hargrove
is
his
name
and
that
was
his
son
yes
and
i
only
sorry
he
does
possess
a
little
more
spirit
how
old
is
he
about
twenty
not
of
legal
age
then
he
old
enough
to
be
his
own
master
the
law
says
differently
i
suggested
in
answer
the
young
man
cursed
the
law
snapping
his
fingers
in
its
imaginary
face
as
he
did
so
at
least
you
will
admit
said
i
that
edward
hargrove
in
the
use
of
a
liberty
to
go
where
he
pleases
and
do
what
he
pleases
exhibits
but
small
discretion
i
will
admit
no
such
thing
what
harm
is
there
i
would
like
to
know
in
a
social
little
game
such
as
we
were
playing
there
were
no
stakes
we
were
not
gambling
i
pointed
to
the
glass
of
ale
left
by
young
hargrove
oh
oh
half
sneered
half
laughed
a
man
twice
the
age
of
the
one
i
had
addressed
who
sat
near
by
listening
to
our
conversation
i
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
said
the
great
danger
lies
there
without
doubt
if
it
were
only
a
glass
of
ale
and
a
game
of
dominoes
but
it
does
stop
there
and
well
the
young
man
father
knows
it
perhaps
he
does
was
answered
i
remember
him
in
his
younger
days
and
a
pretty
high
boy
he
was
he
did
stop
at
a
glass
of
ale
and
a
game
of
dominoes
not
he
i
seen
him
as
drunk
as
a
lord
many
a
time
and
many
a
time
at
a
or
betting
with
the
bravest
i
was
only
a
boy
though
a
pretty
old
boy
but
i
can
tell
you
hargrove
was
no
saint
i
wonder
not
then
that
he
is
so
anxious
for
his
son
was
my
remark
he
knows
well
the
lurking
dangers
in
the
path
he
seems
inclined
to
enter
i
do
see
that
they
have
done
him
much
harm
he
sowed
his
wild
oats
then
got
married
and
settled
down
into
a
good
substantial
citizen
a
little
too
religious
and
pharisaical
i
always
thought
but
upright
in
his
dealings
he
had
his
pleasures
in
early
life
as
was
befitting
the
season
of
youth
why
not
let
his
son
taste
of
the
same
agreeable
fruit
he
wrong
sir
wrong
and
i
said
as
much
to
ned
i
only
wish
the
boy
had
shown
the
right
spunk
this
evening
and
told
the
old
man
to
go
home
about
his
business
so
do
i
chimed
in
the
young
disciple
in
this
bad
school
it
what
i
say
to
my
old
man
in
double
quick
time
if
he
was
to
come
hunting
after
me
he
knows
better
than
to
do
that
said
the
other
in
a
way
that
let
me
deeper
into
the
young
man
character
indeed
he
does
he
tried
his
hand
on
me
once
or
twice
during
the
last
year
but
found
it
would
do
no
how
tom
peters
is
out
of
his
and
can
drink
his
glass
with
any
one
and
not
be
a
grain
the
worse
for
it
exactly
old
boy
said
peters
slapping
his
preceptor
on
the
knee
exactly
i
not
one
of
your
ones
oh
no
look
here
joe
morgan
the
voice
of
simon
slade
now
rung
through
the
just
take
yourself
off
home
i
had
not
observed
the
entrance
of
this
person
he
was
standing
at
the
bar
with
an
emptied
glass
in
his
hand
a
year
had
made
no
improvement
in
his
appearance
on
the
contrary
his
clothes
were
more
worn
and
tattered
his
countenance
more
sadly
marred
what
he
had
said
to
irritate
the
landlord
i
know
not
but
slade
face
was
fiery
with
passion
and
his
eyes
glared
threateningly
at
the
poor
besotted
one
who
showed
not
the
least
inclination
to
obey
off
with
you
i
say
and
never
show
your
face
here
again
i
wo
have
such
low
vagabonds
as
you
are
about
my
house
if
you
ca
keep
decent
and
stay
decent
do
intrude
yourself
here
a
talk
of
decency
retorted
morgan
pah
you
were
a
decent
man
once
and
a
good
miller
into
the
bargain
but
that
past
and
gone
decency
died
out
when
you
exchanged
the
pick
and
for
the
glass
and
muddler
decency
pah
how
you
talk
as
if
it
were
any
more
decent
to
sell
rum
than
to
drink
it
there
was
so
much
of
biting
contempt
in
the
tones
as
well
as
the
words
of
the
man
that
slade
who
had
himself
been
drinking
rather
more
freely
than
usual
was
angered
beyond
catching
up
an
empty
glass
from
the
counter
he
hurled
it
with
all
his
strength
at
the
head
of
joe
morgan
the
missive
just
grazed
one
of
his
temples
and
flew
by
on
its
dangerous
course
the
quick
sharp
cry
of
a
child
startled
the
air
followed
by
exclamations
of
alarm
and
horror
from
many
voices
it
joe
morgan
child
he
killed
her
good
heavens
such
were
the
exclamations
that
rang
through
the
room
i
was
among
the
first
to
reach
the
spot
where
a
little
girl
just
gliding
in
through
the
door
had
been
struck
on
the
forehead
by
the
glass
which
had
cut
a
deep
gash
and
stunned
her
into
insensibility
the
blood
flowed
instantly
from
the
wound
and
covered
her
face
which
presented
a
shocking
appearance
as
i
lifted
her
from
the
floor
upon
which
she
had
fallen
morgan
into
whose
very
soul
the
piercing
cry
of
his
child
had
penetrated
stood
by
my
side
and
grappled
his
arms
around
her
insensible
form
uttering
as
he
did
so
moans
and
lamentations
what
the
matter
oh
what
the
matter
it
was
a
woman
voice
speaking
in
frightened
tones
it
nothing
just
go
out
will
you
ann
i
heard
the
landlord
say
but
his
wife
it
was
slade
having
heard
the
shrieks
of
pain
and
terror
uttered
by
morgan
child
had
come
running
into
the
heeded
not
his
words
but
pressed
forward
into
the
little
group
that
stood
around
the
bleeding
girl
run
for
doctor
green
frank
she
cried
in
an
imperative
voice
the
moment
her
eyes
rested
on
the
little
one
bloody
face
frank
came
around
from
behind
the
bar
in
obedience
to
the
word
but
his
father
gave
a
partial
countermand
and
he
stood
still
upon
observing
which
his
mother
repeated
the
order
even
more
emphatically
why
do
you
jump
you
young
rascal
exclaimed
harvey
green
the
child
may
be
dead
before
the
doctor
can
get
here
frank
hesitated
no
longer
but
disappeared
instantly
through
the
door
poor
poor
child
almost
sobbed
slade
as
she
lifted
the
insensible
form
from
my
arms
how
did
it
happen
who
struck
her
who
curse
him
who
but
simon
slade
answered
joe
morgan
through
his
clenched
teeth
the
look
of
anguish
mingled
with
bitter
reproach
instantly
thrown
upon
the
landlord
by
his
wife
can
hardly
be
forgotten
by
any
who
saw
it
that
night
oh
simon
simon
and
has
it
come
to
this
already
what
a
world
of
bitter
memories
and
sad
forebodings
of
evil
did
that
little
sentence
express
to
this
already
ah
in
the
downward
way
how
rapidly
the
steps
do
tread
how
fast
the
progress
bring
me
a
basin
of
water
and
a
towel
quickly
she
now
exclaimed
the
water
was
brought
and
in
a
little
while
the
face
of
the
child
lay
pure
and
as
white
as
snow
against
her
bosom
the
wound
from
which
the
blood
had
flowed
so
freely
was
found
on
the
upper
part
of
the
forehead
a
little
to
the
side
and
extending
several
inches
back
along
the
top
of
the
head
as
soon
as
the
blood
stains
were
wiped
away
and
the
effusion
partially
stopped
slade
carried
the
still
insensible
body
into
the
next
room
whither
the
distressed
and
now
completely
sobered
father
accompanied
her
i
went
with
them
but
slade
remained
behind
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
was
soon
followed
by
the
restoration
of
life
to
the
inanimate
body
he
happened
to
be
at
home
and
came
instantly
he
had
just
taken
the
last
stitch
in
the
wound
which
required
to
be
drawn
together
and
was
applying
strips
of
adhesive
plaster
when
the
hurried
entrance
of
some
one
caused
me
to
look
up
what
an
apparition
met
my
eyes
a
woman
stood
in
the
door
with
a
face
in
which
maternal
anxiety
and
terror
blended
fearfully
her
countenance
was
like
ashes
her
eyes
straining
wildly
her
lips
apart
while
the
panting
breath
almost
hissed
through
them
joe
joe
what
is
it
where
is
mary
is
she
dead
were
her
eager
inquiries
no
fanny
answered
joe
morgan
starting
up
from
where
he
was
actually
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
reviving
little
one
and
going
quickly
to
his
wife
she
better
now
it
a
bad
hurt
but
the
doctor
says
it
nothing
dangerous
poor
dear
child
the
pale
face
of
the
mother
grew
paler
she
gasped
caught
for
breath
two
or
three
times
a
low
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
and
then
she
lay
white
and
pulseless
in
the
arms
of
her
husband
as
the
doctor
applied
restoratives
i
had
opportunity
to
note
more
particularly
the
appearance
of
morgan
her
person
was
very
slender
and
her
face
so
attenuated
that
it
might
almost
be
called
shadowy
her
hair
which
was
a
rich
chestnut
brown
with
a
slight
golden
lustre
had
fallen
from
her
comb
and
now
lay
all
over
her
neck
and
bosom
in
beautiful
luxuriance
back
from
her
full
temples
it
had
been
smoothed
away
by
the
hand
of
morgan
that
all
the
while
moved
over
her
brow
and
temples
with
a
caressing
motion
that
i
saw
was
unconscious
and
which
revealed
the
tenderness
of
feeling
with
which
debased
as
he
was
he
regarded
the
wife
of
his
youth
and
the
long
suffering
companion
of
his
later
and
evil
days
her
dress
was
plain
and
coarse
but
clean
and
well
fitting
and
about
her
whole
person
was
an
air
of
neatness
and
taste
she
could
not
now
be
called
beautiful
yet
in
her
marred
features
marred
by
suffering
and
grief
were
many
lineaments
of
beauty
and
much
that
told
of
a
true
pure
woman
heart
beating
in
her
bosom
life
came
slowly
back
to
the
stilled
heart
and
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
before
the
circle
of
motion
was
fully
restored
then
the
twain
with
their
child
tenderly
borne
in
the
arms
of
her
father
went
sadly
homeward
leaving
more
than
one
heart
heavier
for
their
visit
i
saw
more
of
the
landlord
wife
on
this
occasion
than
before
she
had
acted
with
a
promptness
and
humanity
that
impressed
me
very
favorably
it
was
plain
from
her
exclamations
on
learning
that
her
husband
hand
inflicted
the
blow
that
came
so
near
destroying
the
child
life
that
her
faith
for
good
in
the
experiment
had
never
been
strong
i
had
already
inferred
as
much
her
face
the
few
times
i
had
seen
her
wore
a
troubled
look
and
i
could
never
forget
its
expression
nor
her
anxious
warning
voice
when
she
discovered
frank
sipping
the
dregs
from
a
glass
in
the
it
is
rarely
i
believe
that
wives
consent
freely
to
the
opening
of
taverns
by
their
husbands
and
the
determination
on
the
part
of
the
latter
to
do
so
is
not
unfrequently
attended
with
a
breach
of
confidence
and
good
feeling
never
afterward
fully
healed
men
look
close
to
the
money
result
women
to
the
moral
consequences
i
doubt
if
there
be
one
in
ten
between
whom
and
his
wife
there
exists
a
good
understanding
to
say
nothing
of
genuine
affection
and
in
the
exceptional
cases
it
will
generally
be
found
that
the
wife
is
as
mercenary
or
careless
of
the
public
good
as
her
husband
i
have
known
some
women
to
set
up
but
they
were
women
of
bad
principles
and
worse
hearts
i
remember
one
case
where
a
woman
with
a
sober
husband
opened
a
the
husband
opposed
remonstrated
begged
threatened
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
wife
by
working
for
the
clothing
stores
had
earned
and
saved
about
three
hundred
dollars
the
love
of
money
in
the
slow
process
of
accumulation
had
been
awakened
and
in
ministering
to
the
depraved
appetites
of
men
who
loved
drink
and
neglected
their
families
she
saw
a
quicker
mode
of
acquiring
the
gold
she
coveted
and
so
the
was
opened
and
what
was
the
result
the
husband
quit
going
to
church
he
had
no
heart
for
that
for
even
on
the
sabbath
day
the
fiery
stream
was
stayed
not
in
his
house
next
he
began
to
tipple
soon
alas
the
subtle
poison
so
pervaded
his
system
that
morbid
desire
came
and
then
he
moved
along
in
the
way
of
ruin
in
less
than
three
years
i
think
from
the
time
the
was
opened
by
his
wife
he
was
in
a
drunkard
grave
a
year
or
two
more
and
the
pit
that
was
digged
for
others
by
the
hands
of
the
wife
she
fell
into
herself
after
breathing
an
atmosphere
poisoned
by
the
fumes
of
liquor
the
love
of
tasting
it
was
gradually
formed
and
she
too
in
the
end
became
a
slave
to
the
demon
drink
she
died
at
last
poor
as
a
beggar
in
the
street
ah
this
is
the
way
to
ruin
and
they
who
open
the
gates
as
well
as
those
who
enter
the
downward
path
alike
go
to
destruction
but
this
is
digressing
after
joe
morgan
and
his
wife
left
the
sickle
and
sheaf
with
that
gentle
child
who
as
i
afterward
learned
had
not
for
a
year
or
more
laid
her
little
head
to
sleep
until
her
father
returned
home
and
who
if
he
stayed
out
beyond
a
certain
hour
would
go
for
him
and
lead
him
back
a
very
angel
of
love
and
patience
i
the
to
see
how
life
was
passing
there
not
one
of
all
i
had
left
in
the
room
remained
the
incident
which
had
occurred
was
of
so
painful
a
nature
that
no
further
unalloyed
pleasure
was
to
be
had
there
during
the
evening
and
so
each
had
retired
in
his
little
kingdom
the
landlord
sat
alone
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
and
his
face
shaded
from
the
light
the
whole
aspect
of
the
man
was
that
of
one
in
as
i
entered
he
raised
his
head
and
turned
his
face
toward
me
its
expression
was
painful
rather
an
unfortunate
affair
said
he
i
angry
with
myself
and
sorry
for
the
poor
child
but
she
no
business
here
as
for
joe
morgan
it
would
take
a
saint
to
bear
his
tongue
when
once
set
by
liquor
i
wish
he
stay
away
from
the
house
nobody
wants
his
company
oh
dear
the
ejaculation
or
rather
groan
that
closed
the
sentence
showed
how
little
slade
was
satisfied
with
himself
notwithstanding
this
feeble
attempt
at
his
thirst
for
liquor
draws
him
hither
i
remarked
the
attraction
of
your
bar
to
his
appetite
is
like
that
of
the
magnet
to
the
needle
he
can
not
stay
away
he
must
stay
away
exclaimed
the
landlord
with
some
vehemence
of
tone
striking
his
fist
upon
the
table
by
which
he
sat
he
must
stay
away
there
is
scarcely
an
evening
that
he
does
not
ruffle
my
temper
and
mar
good
feelings
in
all
the
company
just
see
what
he
provoked
me
to
do
this
evening
i
might
have
killed
the
child
it
makes
my
blood
run
cold
to
think
of
it
yes
sir
he
must
stay
away
if
no
better
can
be
done
i
hire
a
man
to
stand
at
the
door
and
keep
him
out
he
never
troubled
you
at
the
mill
said
i
no
man
was
required
at
the
mill
door
no
and
the
landlord
gave
emphasis
to
the
word
by
an
oath
ejaculated
with
a
heartiness
that
almost
startled
me
i
had
not
heard
him
swear
before
no
the
great
trouble
was
to
get
him
and
keep
him
there
the
idle
fellow
i
am
afraid
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
things
do
go
on
quite
so
smoothly
here
as
they
did
at
the
mill
your
customers
are
of
a
different
class
i
do
know
about
that
why
not
he
did
not
just
relish
my
remark
between
quiet
thrifty
substantial
farmers
and
drinking
loungers
are
many
degrees
of
comparison
excuse
me
sir
simon
slade
elevated
his
person
the
men
who
visit
my
as
a
general
thing
are
quite
as
respectable
moral
and
substantial
as
any
who
came
to
the
mill
and
i
believe
more
so
the
first
people
in
the
place
sir
are
to
be
found
here
judge
lyman
and
judge
hammond
lawyer
wilks
and
doctor
maynard
grand
and
lee
and
dozens
of
others
all
our
first
people
no
sir
you
must
judge
all
by
vagabonds
like
joe
morgan
there
was
a
testy
spirit
manifested
that
i
did
not
care
to
provoke
i
could
have
met
his
assertion
with
facts
and
inferences
of
a
character
to
startle
any
one
occupying
his
position
who
was
in
a
calm
reflective
state
but
to
argue
with
him
then
would
have
been
worse
than
idle
and
so
i
let
him
talk
on
until
the
excitement
occasioned
by
my
words
died
out
for
want
of
new
fuel
night
the
third
joe
morgan
child
i
do
see
anything
of
your
very
particular
friend
joe
morgan
this
evening
said
harvey
green
leaning
on
the
bar
and
speaking
to
slade
it
was
the
night
succeeding
that
on
which
the
painful
and
exciting
scene
with
the
child
had
occurred
no
was
answered
and
to
the
word
was
added
a
profane
imprecation
no
and
if
he
just
keep
away
from
here
he
may
go
to
on
a
horse
and
a
porcupine
saddle
as
fast
as
he
pleases
tried
my
patience
beyond
endurance
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that
he
gets
no
more
drams
at
this
bar
i
borne
his
vile
tongue
and
seen
my
company
annoyed
by
him
just
as
long
as
i
mean
to
stand
it
last
night
decided
me
suppose
i
killed
that
child
you
have
had
trouble
then
and
no
mistake
would
i
blast
her
little
picture
what
business
has
she
creeping
in
here
every
night
she
must
have
a
nice
kind
of
a
mother
remarked
green
with
a
cold
sneer
i
do
know
what
she
is
now
said
slade
a
slight
touch
of
feeling
in
his
voice
i
suppose
i
could
look
at
her
last
night
it
made
me
sick
but
there
was
a
time
when
fanny
morgan
was
the
loveliest
and
best
woman
in
cedarville
i
say
that
for
her
oh
dear
what
a
life
her
miserable
husband
has
caused
her
to
lead
better
that
he
were
dead
and
out
of
the
way
better
a
thousand
times
answered
slade
if
he
only
fall
down
some
night
and
break
his
neck
it
would
be
a
blessing
to
his
family
and
to
you
in
particular
laughed
green
you
may
be
sure
it
would
cost
me
a
large
sum
for
mourning
was
the
unfeeling
response
let
us
leave
the
of
the
sickle
and
sheaf
and
its
inmates
and
look
in
upon
the
family
of
joe
morgan
and
see
how
it
is
in
the
home
of
the
poor
inebriate
we
will
pass
by
a
quick
transition
joe
the
thin
white
hand
of
morgan
clasps
the
arm
of
her
husband
who
has
arisen
up
suddenly
and
now
stands
by
the
partly
opened
door
do
go
out
joe
please
do
go
out
father
a
feeble
voice
calls
from
the
corner
of
an
old
settee
where
little
mary
lies
with
her
head
bandaged
well
i
wo
then
is
replied
not
angrily
nor
even
fretfully
but
in
a
kind
voice

and
sit
by
me

tenderly
yet
how
full
of
concern
is
that
low
sweet
voice
come
wo

my
hand
father
joe
takes
the
hand
of
little
mary

upon
his
you

away
and
leave
me
will
you
father
say
you
wo
how
very
hot
your
hand

dear

your
head
ache
a
little
but
it
will
soon
feel
better
up
into
the
swollen
and
disfigured
face
of
the
fallen
father
the
large
earnest
blue
eyes
of
the
child
are
raised
she
does
not
see
the
marred
lineaments
but
only
the
beloved
countenance
of
her
parent

wish

child
raises
herself
evidently
with
a
painful
effort
and
leans
nearer
to
her
father
joe
shakes
his
head
and
poor
mary
drops
back
upon
her
pillow
with
a
sigh
her
lids
fall
and
the
long
lashes
lie
strongly
relieved
on
her
colorless
cheeks
i
wo
go
there
dear
so
let
your
heart
be
at
rest
mary
lids
unclose
and
two
round
drops
released
from
their
clasp
glide
slowly
over
her
face
thank
you
father
thank
you
mother
will
be
so
glad
the
eyes
closed
again
and
the
father
moved
uneasily
his
heart
is
touched
there
is
a
struggle
within
him
it
is
on
his
lips
to
say
that
he
will
never
drink
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
again
but
resolution
just
lacks
the
force
of
utterance
father
well
dear
i
do
think
i
be
well
enough
to
go
out
in
two
or
three
days
you
know
the
doctor
said
that
i
would
have
to
keep
very
still
for
i
had
a
great
deal
of
fever
yes
poor
child
now
wo
you
promise
me
one
thing
what
is
it
dear
not
to
go
out
in
the
evening
until
i
get
well
joe
morgan
hesitated
just
promise
me
that
father
it
wo
be
long
i
shall
be
up
again
in
a
little
while
how
well
the
father
knows
what
is
in
the
heart
of
his
child
her
fears
are
all
for
him
who
is
to
go
up
after
her
poor
father
and
lead
him
home
when
the
darkness
of
inebriety
is
on
his
spirit
and
external
perception
so
dulled
that
not
skill
enough
remains
to
shun
the
harm
that
lies
in
his
path
do
promise
just
that
father
dear
he
can
not
resist
the
pleading
voice
and
look
i
promise
it
mary
so
shut
your
eyes
now
and
go
to
sleep
i
afraid
this
fever
will
increase
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
mary
does
not
clasp
her
hands
nor
show
strong
external
signs
of
pleasure
but
how
full
of
a
pure
unselfish
joy
is
that
ejaculation
spoken
in
the
depths
of
her
spirit
as
well
as
syllabled
by
her
tongue
morgan
has
been
no
unconcerned
witness
of
all
this
but
knowing
the
child
influence
over
her
father
she
has
not
ventured
a
word
more
was
to
be
gained
she
was
sure
by
silence
on
her
part
and
so
she
kept
silent
now
she
comes
nearer
to
them
and
says
as
she
lets
a
hand
rest
on
the
shoulder
of
her
husband
you
feel
better
for
that
promise
already
i
know
you
do
he
looks
up
to
her
and
smiles
faintly
he
does
feel
better
but
is
hardly
willing
to
acknowledge
it
soon
after
mary
is
sleeping
it
does
not
escape
the
observation
of
morgan
that
her
husband
grows
restless
for
he
gets
up
suddenly
every
now
and
then
and
walks
quickly
across
the
room
as
if
in
search
of
something
then
sits
down
listlessly
sighs
stretches
himself
and
says
oh
dear
what
shall
she
do
for
him
how
is
the
want
of
his
accustomed
evening
stimulus
to
be
met
she
thinks
and
questions
and
grieves
inwardly
poor
joe
morgan
his
wife
understands
his
case
and
pities
him
from
her
heart
but
what
can
she
do
go
out
and
get
him
something
to
drink
oh
no
no
no
never
she
answered
the
thought
audibly
almost
in
the
excitement
of
her
feelings
an
hour
has
passed
joe
restlessness
has
increased
instead
of
diminishing
what
is
to
be
done
now
morgan
has
left
the
room
she
has
resolved
upon
something
for
the
case
must
be
met
ah
here
she
comes
after
an
absence
of
five
minutes
bearing
in
her
hand
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
it
was
kind
and
thoughtful
in
you
fanny
says
morgan
as
with
a
gratified
look
he
takes
the
cup
but
his
hand
trembles
and
he
spills
a
portion
of
the
contents
as
ho
tries
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
how
dreadfully
his
nerves
are
shattered
unnatural
stimulants
have
been
applied
so
long
that
all
true
vitality
seems
lost
and
now
the
hand
of
his
wife
is
holding
the
cup
to
his
lips
and
he
drinks
eagerly
this
is
dreadful
dreadful
where
will
it
end
what
is
to
be
done
fanny
suppresses
a
sob
as
she
thus
gives
vent
to
her
troubled
feelings
twice
already
has
her
husband
been
seized
with
the
drunkard
madness
and
in
the
nervous
prostration
consequent
upon
even
a
brief
withdrawal
of
his
usual
strong
stimulants
she
sees
the
fearful
precursor
of
another
attack
of
this
dreadful
and
dangerous
malady
in
the
hope
of
supplying
the
needed
tone
she
has
given
him
strong
coffee
and
this
for
the
time
produces
the
effect
desired
the
restlessness
is
allayed
and
a
quiet
state
of
body
and
mind
succeeds
it
needs
but
a
suggestion
to
induce
him
to
retire
for
the
night
after
being
a
few
minutes
in
bed
sleep
steals
over
him
and
his
heavy
breathing
tells
that
he
is
in
the
world
of
dreams
and
now
there
comes
a
tap
at
the
door
come
in
is
answered
the
latch
is
lifted
the
door
swings
open
and
a
woman
enters
mrs
slade
the
name
is
uttered
in
a
tone
of
surprise
fanny
how
are
you
this
evening
kindly
yet
half
sadly
the
words
are
said
tolerable
i
thank
you
the
hands
of
the
two
women
are
clasped
and
for
a
few
moments
they
gaze
into
each
other
face
what
a
world
of
tender
commiseration
is
in
that
of
slade
how
is
little
mary
not
so
well
i
afraid
she
has
a
good
deal
of
fever
indeed
oh
i
sorry
poor
child
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
was
oh
fanny
you
do
know
how
it
has
troubled
me
i
been
intending
to
come
around
all
day
to
see
how
she
was
but
could
get
off
until
now
it
came
near
killing
her
said
morgan
it
in
god
mercy
she
escaped
the
thought
of
it
curdles
the
very
blood
in
my
veins
poor
child
is
this
her
on
the
settee
yes
slade
takes
a
chair
and
sitting
by
the
sleeping
child
gazes
long
upon
her
pale
sweet
face
now
the
lips
of
mary
part
words
are
murmured
what
is
she
saying
no
no
mother
i
ca
go
to
bed
yet
father
is
home
and
it
so
dark
there
no
one
to
lead
him
over
the
bridge
i
not
afraid
do
do
cry
so
mother
i
not
afraid
nothing
will
hurt
me
the
child
face
flushes
she
moans
and
throws
her
arms
about
uneasily
hark
again
i
wish
slade
would
look
so
cross
at
me
he
never
did
when
i
went
to
the
mill
he
does
take
me
on
his
knee
now
and
stroke
my
hair
oh
dear
i
wish
father
would
go
there
any
more
do
do
slade
oh
oh
the
ejaculation
prolonged
into
a
frightened
cry
my
head
my
head
a
few
choking
sobs
are
followed
by
low
moans
and
then
the
child
breathes
easily
again
but
the
flush
does
not
leave
her
cheek
and
when
slade
from
whose
eyes
the
tears
come
forth
drop
by
drop
and
roll
down
her
face
touches
it
lightly
she
finds
it
hot
with
fever
has
the
doctor
seen
her
fanny
no
he
should
see
her
at
once
i
will
go
for
him
and
slade
starts
up
and
goes
quickly
from
the
room
in
a
little
while
she
returns
with
doctor
green
who
sits
down
and
looks
at
the
child
for
some
moments
with
a
sober
thoughtful
face
then
he
lays
his
fingers
on
her
pulse
and
times
its
beat
by
his
watch
shakes
his
head
and
looks
graver
still
how
long
has
she
had
fever
he
asks
all
day
you
should
have
sent
for
me
earlier
oh
doctor
she
is
not
dangerous
i
hope
morgan
looks
frightened
she
a
sick
child
madam
you
promised
father
the
dreamer
is
speaking
i
not
well
enough
yet
oh
do
go
father
do
there
he
gone
well
well
i
try
and
walk
there
i
can
sit
down
and
rest
by
the
way
oh
dear
how
tired
i
am
father
father
the
child
starts
up
and
looks
about
her
wildly
oh
mother
is
it
you
and
she
sinks
back
upon
her
pillow
looking
now
inquiringly
from
face
to
face
father
where
is
father
she
asks
asleep
dear
oh
is
he
i
glad
her
eyes
close
wearily
do
you
feel
any
pain
mary
inquired
the
doctor
yes
sir
in
my
head
it
aches
and
beats
so
the
cry
of
father
had
reached
the
ears
of
morgan
who
is
sleeping
in
the
next
room
and
roused
him
into
consciousness
he
knows
the
voice
why
is
he
here
at
this
late
hour
do
you
feel
any
pain
mary
the
question
he
hears
distinctly
and
the
faintly
uttered
reply
also
he
is
sober
enough
to
have
all
his
fears
instantly
excited
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
he
loves
as
he
loves
that
child
and
so
he
gets
up
and
dresses
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
the
stimulus
of
anxiety
giving
tension
to
his
relaxed
nerves
oh
father
the
quick
ears
of
mary
detect
his
entrance
first
and
a
pleasant
smile
welcomes
him
is
she
very
sick
doctor
he
asks
in
a
voice
full
of
anxiety
she
a
sick
child
sir
you
should
have
sent
for
me
earlier
the
doctor
speaks
rather
sternly
and
with
a
purpose
to
rebuke
the
reply
stirs
morgan
and
he
seems
to
cower
half
timidly
under
the
words
as
if
they
were
blows
mary
has
already
grasped
her
hand
and
holds
on
to
it
tightly
after
examining
the
case
a
little
more
closely
the
doctor
prepares
some
medicine
and
promising
to
call
early
in
the
morning
goes
away
slade
follows
soon
after
but
in
parting
with
morgan
leaves
something
in
her
hand
which
to
the
surprise
of
the
latter
proves
to
be
a
bill
the
tears
start
to
her
eyes
and
she
conceals
the
money
in
her
bosom
murmuring
a
fervent
god
bless
her
a
simple
act
of
restitution
is
this
on
the
part
of
slade
prompted
as
well
by
humanity
as
a
sense
of
justice
with
one
hand
her
husband
has
taken
the
bread
from
the
family
of
his
old
friend
and
thus
with
the
other
she
restores
it
and
now
morgan
and
his
wife
are
alone
with
their
sick
child
higher
the
fever
rises
and
partial
delirium
seizes
upon
her
brain
she
talks
for
a
time
almost
incessantly
all
her
trouble
is
about
her
father
and
she
is
constantly
referring
to
his
promise
not
to
go
out
in
the
evening
until
she
gets
well
how
tenderly
and
touchingly
she
appeals
to
him
now
looking
up
into
his
face
in
partial
recognition
and
now
calling
anxiously
after
him
as
if
he
had
left
her
and
was
going
away
you
not
forget
your
promise
will
you
father
she
says
speaking
so
calmly
that
he
thinks
her
mind
has
ceased
to
wander
no
dear
i
will
not
forget
it
he
answers
smoothing
her
hair
gently
with
his
hand
you
not
go
out
in
the
evening
again
until
i
get
well
no
dear
father
what
love
stoop
down
closer
i
do
want
mother
to
hear
it
will
make
her
feel
so
bad
the
father
bends
his
ear
close
to
the
lips
of
mary
how
he
starts
and
shudders
what
has
she
said
only
these
brief
words
i
shall
not
get
well
father
i
going
to
die
the
groans
impossible
to
repress
that
issued
through
the
lips
of
joe
morgan
startled
the
ears
of
his
wife
and
she
came
quickly
to
the
bedside
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
joe
she
inquired
with
a
look
of
anxiety
hush
father
do
tell
her
i
only
said
it
to
you
and
mary
put
a
finger
on
her
lips
and
looked
mysterious
there
mother
you
go
away
you
got
trouble
enough
any
how
do
tell
her
father
but
the
words
which
came
to
him
like
a
prophecy
awoke
such
pangs
of
fear
and
remorse
in
the
heart
of
joe
morgan
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
repress
the
signs
of
pain
for
some
moments
he
gazed
at
his
wife
then
stooping
forward
suddenly
he
buried
his
face
in
the
and
sobbed
bitterly
a
suggestion
of
the
truth
now
flashed
through
the
mind
of
morgan
sending
a
thrill
of
pain
along
every
nerve
ere
she
had
time
to
recover
herself
the
low
sweet
voice
of
mary
broke
upon
the
hushed
air
of
the
room
and
she
sung
jesus
can
make
a
dying
bed
feel
soft
as
downy
pillows
are
while
on
his
breast
i
lean
my
head
and
breathe
my
life
out
sweetly
there
it
was
impossible
for
morgan
longer
to
repress
her
feelings
as
the
softly
breathed
strain
died
away
her
sobs
broke
forth
and
for
a
time
she
wept
violently
there
said
the
child
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
i
only
told
father
because
because
he
promised
not
to
go
to
the
tavern
any
more
until
i
got
well
and
i
not
going
to
get
well
so
you
see
mother
he
never
go
again
never
never
never
oh
dear
how
my
head
pains
slade
threw
it
so
hard
but
it
did
strike
father
and
i
so
glad
how
it
would
have
hurt
him
poor
father
but
he
never
go
there
any
more
and
that
will
be
so
good
wo
it
mother
a
light
broke
over
her
face
but
seeing
that
her
mother
still
wept
she
said
do
cry
maybe
i
be
better
and
then
her
eyes
closed
heavily
and
she
slept
again
joe
said
morgan
after
she
had
in
a
measure
recovered
herself
she
spoke
firmly
joe
did
you
hear
what
she
said
morgan
only
answered
with
a
groan
her
mind
wanders
and
yet
she
may
have
spoken
only
the
truth
he
groaned
again
if
she
should
die
joe
do
oh
do
talk
so
fanny
she
not
going
to
die
it
only
because
she
a
little
why
is
she
joe
it
the
fever
only
the
fever
fanny
it
was
the
blow
and
the
wound
on
her
head
that
caused
the
fever
how
do
we
know
the
extent
of
injury
on
the
brain
doctor
green
looked
very
serious
i
afraid
husband
that
the
worst
is
before
us
i
borne
and
suffered
a
great
deal
only
god
knows
how
much
i
pray
that
i
may
have
strength
to
bear
this
trial
also
dear
child
she
is
better
fitted
for
heaven
than
for
earth
and
it
may
be
that
god
is
about
to
take
her
to
himself
she
been
a
great
comfort
to
me
and
to
you
joe
more
like
a
guardian
angel
than
a
child
morgan
had
tried
to
speak
very
firmly
but
as
sentence
followed
sentence
her
voice
lost
more
and
more
of
its
even
tone
with
the
closing
words
all
vanished
and
she
wept
bitterly
what
could
her
feeble
erring
husband
do
but
weep
with
her
joe
morgan
aroused
herself
as
quickly
as
possible
for
she
had
that
to
say
which
she
feared
she
might
not
have
the
heart
to
utter
joe
if
mary
dies
you
can
not
forget
the
cause
of
her
death
oh
fanny
fanny
nor
the
hand
that
struck
the
cruel
blow
forget
it
never
and
if
i
forgive
simon
slade
nor
the
place
where
the
blow
was
dealt
said
morgan
interrupting
him
poor
poor
child
moaned
the
man
nor
your
promise
joe
nor
your
promise
given
to
our
dying
child
father
father
dear
father
mary
eyes
suddenly
unclosed
as
she
called
her
father
eagerly
here
i
am
love
what
is
it
and
joe
morgan
pressed
up
to
the
bedside
oh
it
you
father
i
dreamed
that
you
had
gone
out
and
and
but
you
wo
will

mary
at
night
father
that
what
i
mean
you
wo
will
you
no
dear
no
a
soft
smile
trembled
over
the
child
face
her
eyelids
drooped
wearily
and
she
fell
off
into
slumber
again
she
seemed
not
so
restless
as
before
did
not
moan
nor
throw
herself
about
in
her
sleep
she
better
i
think
said
morgan
as
he
bent
over
her
and
listened
to
her
softer
breathing
it
seems
so
replied
his
wife
and
now
joe
you
must
go
to
bed
again
i
will
lie
down
here
with
mary
and
be
ready
to
do
any
thing
for
her
that
she
may
want
i
do
feel
sleepy
i
sure
i
could
close
my
eyes
so
let
me
sit
up
with
mary
you
are
tired
and
worn
out
morgan
looked
earnestly
into
her
husband
face
his
eyes
were
unusually
bright
and
she
noticed
a
slight
nervous
restlessness
about
his
lips
she
laid
one
of
her
hands
on
his
and
perceived
a
slight
tremor
you
must
go
to
bed
she
spoke
firmly
i
shall
not
let
you
sit
up
with
mary
so
go
at
once
and
she
drew
him
almost
by
force
into
the
next
room
it
no
use
fanny
there
not
a
wink
of
sleep
in
my
eyes
i
shall
lie
awake
anyhow
so
do
you
get
a
little
rest
even
as
he
spoke
there
were
nervous
twitchings
of
his
arms
and
shoulders
and
as
he
entered
the
chamber
impelled
by
his
wife
he
stopped
suddenly
and
said
what
is
that
where
asked
morgan
oh
it
nothing
i
see
only
one
of
my
old
boots
i
thought
it
a
great
black
cat
oh
what
a
shudder
of
despair
seized
upon
the
heart
of
the
wretched
wife
too
well
she
knew
the
fearful
signs
of
that
terrible
madness
from
which
twice
before
he
had
suffered
she
could
have
looked
on
calmly
and
seen
him
die
but
not
this
not
this
oh
father
in
heaven
she
murmured
with
such
a
that
it
seemed
as
if
life
itself
would
go
out
get
into
bed
joe
get
into
bed
as
quickly
as
possible
morgan
was
now
passive
in
the
hands
of
his
wife
and
obeyed
her
almost
like
a
child
he
had
turned
down
the
and
was
about
getting
in
when
he
started
back
with
a
look
of
disgust
and
alarm
there
nothing
there
joe
what
the
matter
with
you
i
sure
i
do
know
fanny
and
his
teeth
rattled
together
as
he
spoke
i
thought
there
was
a
great
toad
under
the
clothes
how
foolish
you
are
yet
tears
were
blinding
her
eyes
as
she
said
this
it
only
fancy
get
into
bed
and
shut
your
eyes
i
make
you
another
cup
of
strong
coffee
perhaps
that
will
do
you
good
only
a
little
nervous
mary
sickness
has
disturbed
you
joe
looked
cautiously
under
the
bedclothes
as
he
lifted
them
up
still
farther
and
peered
beneath
you
know
there
nothing
in
your
bed
see
and
morgan
threw
with
a
single
jerk
all
the
clothes
upon
the
floor
there
now
look
for
yourself
now
shut
your
eyes
she
continued
as
she
spread
the
sheet
and
quilt
over
him
after
his
head
was
on
the
pillow
shut
them
tight
and
keep
them
so
until
i
boil
the
water
and
make
a
cup
of
coffee
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
nothing
but
fancy
morgan
closed
his
eyes
firmly
and
drew
the
clothes
over
his
head
i
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
said
his
wife
going
hurriedly
to
the
door
ere
leaving
however
she
partly
turned
her
head
and
glanced
back
there
sat
her
husband
upright
and
staring
fearfully
do
fanny
do
go
away
he
cried
in
a
frightened
voice
joe
joe
why
will
you
be
so
foolish
it
nothing
but
imagination
now
do
lie
down
and
shut
your
eyes
keep
them
shut
there
now
and
she
laid
a
hand
over
his
eyes
and
pressed
it
down
tightly
i
wish
doctor
green
was
here
said
the
wretched
man
he
could
give
me
something
shall
i
go
for
him
go
fanny
run
over
right
quickly
but
you
wo
keep
in
bed
yes
i
will
there
now
and
he
drew
the
clothes
over
his
face
there
i
lie
just
so
until
you
come
back
now
run
fanny
and
do
stay
a
minute
scarcely
stopping
to
think
morgan
went
hurriedly
from
the
room
and
drawing
an
old
shawl
over
her
head
started
with
swift
feet
for
the
residence
of
doctor
green
which
was
not
very
far
away
the
kind
doctor
understood
at
a
word
the
sad
condition
of
her
husband
and
promised
to
attend
him
immediately
back
she
flew
at
even
a
wilder
speed
her
heart
throbbing
with
vague
apprehension
oh
what
a
fearful
cry
was
that
which
smote
her
ears
as
she
came
within
a
few
paces
of
home
she
knew
the
voice
changed
as
it
was
by
terror
and
a
shudder
almost
palsied
her
heart
at
a
single
bound
she
cleared
the
intervening
space
and
in
the
next
moment
was
in
the
room
where
she
had
left
her
husband
but
he
was
not
there
with
suspended
breath
and
feet
that
scarcely
obeyed
her
will
she
passed
into
the
chamber
where
little
mary
lay
not
here
joe
husband
she
called
in
a
faint
voice
here
he
is
mother
and
now
she
saw
that
joe
had
crept
into
the
bed
behind
the
sick
child
and
that
her
arm
was
drawn
tightly
around
his
neck
you
wo
let
them
hurt
me
will
you
dear
said
the
pool
frightened
victim
of
a
terrible
mania
nothing
will
hurt
you
father
answered
mary
in
a
voice
that
showed
her
mind
to
be
clear
and
fully
conscious
of
her
parent
true
condition
she
had
seen
him
thus
before
ah
what
an
experience
for
a
child
you
an
angel
my
good
angel
mary
he
murmured
in
a
voice
yet
trembling
with
fear
pray
for
me
my
child
oh
ask
your
father
in
heaven
to
save
me
from
these
dreadful
creatures
there
now
he
cried
rising
up
suddenly
and
looking
toward
the
door
keep
out
go
away
you
ca
come
in
here
this
is
mary
room
and
she
an
angel
ah
ha
i
knew
you
would
dare
come
in
here
a
single
saint
can
put
to
flight
ten
thousand
blustering
sons
of
night
he
added
in
a
half
wandering
way
yet
with
an
assured
voice
as
he
laid
himself
back
upon
his
pillow
and
drew
the
clothes
over
his
head
poor
father
sighed
the
child
as
she
gathered
both
arms
about
his
neck
i
will
be
your
good
angel
nothing
shall
hurt
you
here
i
knew
i
would
be
safe
where
you
were
he
whispered
i
knew
it
and
so
i
came
kiss
me
love
how
pure
and
fervent
was
the
kiss
laid
instantly
upon
his
lips
there
was
a
power
in
it
to
remand
the
evil
influences
that
were
surrounding
and
pressing
in
upon
him
like
a
flood
all
was
quiet
now
and
morgan
neither
by
word
nor
movement
disturbed
the
solemn
stillness
that
reigned
in
the
apartment
in
a
few
minutes
the
deepened
breathing
of
her
husband
gave
a
blessed
intimation
that
he
was
sinking
into
sleep
oh
sleep
sleep
how
tearfully
in
times
past
had
she
prayed
that
he
might
sleep
and
yet
no
sleep
came
for
hours
and
days
even
though
powerful
opiates
were
given
until
exhausted
nature
yielded
and
then
sleep
had
a
long
long
struggle
with
death
now
the
sphere
of
his
loving
innocent
child
seemed
to
have
overcome
at
least
for
the
time
the
evil
influences
that
were
getting
possession
even
of
his
external
senses
yes
yes
he
was
sleeping
oh
what
a
fervent
thank
god
went
up
from
the
heart
of
his
stricken
wife
soon
the
quick
ears
of
morgan
detected
the
doctor
approaching
footsteps
and
she
met
him
at
the
door
with
a
finger
on
her
lips
a
whispered
word
or
two
explained
the
better
aspect
of
affairs
and
the
doctor
said
encouragingly
that
good
if
he
will
only
sleep
on
do
you
think
he
will
doctor
was
asked
anxiously
he
may
but
we
can
not
hope
too
strongly
it
would
be
something
very
unusual
both
passed
noiselessly
into
the
chamber
morgan
still
slept
and
by
his
deep
breathing
it
was
plain
that
he
slept
soundly
and
mary
too
was
sleeping
her
face
now
laid
against
her
father
and
her
arms
still
about
his
neck
the
sight
touched
even
the
doctor
heart
and
moistened
his
eyes
for
nearly
half
an
hour
he
remained
and
then
as
morgan
continued
to
sleep
he
left
medicine
to
be
given
immediately
and
went
home
promising
to
call
early
in
the
morning
it
is
now
past
midnight
and
we
leave
the
lonely
watcher
with
her
sick
ones
i
was
sitting
with
a
newspaper
in
my
hand
not
reading
but
musing
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
late
in
the
evening
marked
by
the
incidents
just
detailed
where
your
mother
i
heard
simon
slade
inquire
he
had
just
entered
an
adjoining
room
she
gone
out
somewhere
was
answered
by
his
daughter
flora
where
i
do
know
how
long
has
she
been
away
more
than
an
hour
and
you
do
know
where
she
went
to
no
sir
nothing
more
was
said
but
i
heard
the
landlord
heavy
feet
moving
backward
and
forward
across
the
room
for
some
minutes
why
ann
where
have
you
been
the
door
of
the
next
room
had
opened
and
shut
where
i
wish
you
had
been
with
me
was
answered
in
a
very
firm
voice
where
to
joe
morgan
humph
only
this
ejaculation
met
my
ears
but
something
was
said
in
a
low
voice
to
which
slade
replied
with
some
warmth
if
you
do
have
his
child
blood
clinging
for
life
to
your
garments
you
may
be
thankful
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
quickly
all
that
my
words
indicate
little
mary
is
very
ill
well
what
of
it
much
the
doctor
thinks
her
in
great
danger
the
cut
on
her
head
has
thrown
her
into
a
violent
fever
and
she
is
delirious
oh
simon
if
you
had
heard
what
i
heard
what
was
asked
in
a
growling
tone
she
is
out
of
her
mind
as
i
said
and
talks
a
great
deal
she
talked
about
you
of
me
well
what
had
she
to
say
she
said
so
pitifully
wish
slade
would
look
so
cross
at
me
he
never
did
when
i
went
to
the
mill
he
does
take
me
on
his
knee
now
and
stroke
my
hair
oh
dear
poor
child
she
was
always
so
good
did
she
say
that
slade
seemed
touched
yes
and
a
great
deal
more
once
she
screamed
out
do
do
slade
do
my
head
my
head
it
made
my
very
heart
ache
i
can
never
forget
her
pale
frightened
face
nor
her
cry
of
fear
simon
if
she
should
die
there
was
a
long
silence
if
we
were
only
back
to
the
mill
it
was
slade
voice
there
now
i
do
want
to
hear
that
again
quickly
spoke
out
the
landlord
i
made
a
slave
of
myself
long
enough
you
had
at
least
a
clear
conscience
his
wife
answered
do
hush
will
you
slade
was
now
angry
one
would
think
by
the
way
you
talk
sometimes
that
i
had
broken
every
command
of
the
decalogue
you
will
break
hearts
as
well
as
commandments
if
you
keep
on
for
a
few
years
as
you
have
begun
and
ruin
souls
as
well
as
fortunes
slade
spoke
calmly
but
with
marked
severity
of
tone
her
husband
answered
with
an
oath
and
then
left
the
room
banging
the
door
after
him
in
the
hush
that
followed
i
retired
to
my
chamber
and
lay
for
an
hour
awake
pondering
on
all
i
had
just
heard
what
a
revelation
was
in
that
brief
passage
of
words
between
the
landlord
and
his
excited
companion
night
the
fourth
death
of
little
mary
morgan
where
are
you
going
ann
it
was
the
landlord
voice
time
a
little
after
dark
i
going
over
to
see
morgan
answered
his
wife
what
for
i
wish
to
go
was
replied
well
i
do
wish
you
to
go
said
slade
in
a
very
decided
way
i
ca
help
that
simon
mary
i
told
is
dying
and
joe
is
in
a
dreadful
way
i
needed
there
and
so
are
you
as
to
that
matter
there
was
a
time
when
if
word
came
to
you
that
morgan
or
his
family
were
in
trouble
do
hush
will
you
exclaimed
the
landlord
angrily
i
wo
be
preached
to
in
this
way
any
longer
oh
well
then
do
interfere
with
my
movements
simon
that
all
i
have
to
say
i
needed
over
there
as
i
just
said
and
i
going
there
were
considerable
odds
against
him
and
slade
perceiving
this
turned
off
muttering
something
that
his
wife
did
not
hear
and
she
went
on
her
way
a
hurried
walk
brought
her
to
the
wretched
home
of
the
poor
drunkard
whose
wife
met
her
at
the
door
how
is
mary
was
the
visitor
earnest
inquiry
morgan
tried
to
answer
the
question
but
though
her
lips
moved
no
sounds
issued
therefrom
slade
pressed
her
hands
tightly
in
both
of
hers
and
then
passed
in
with
her
to
the
room
where
the
child
lay
a
stance
sufficed
to
tell
slade
that
death
had
already
laid
his
icy
fingers
upon
her
brow
how
are
you
dear
she
asked
as
she
bent
over
and
kissed
her
better
i
thank
you
replied
mary
in
a
low
whisper
then
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
mother
face
with
a
look
of
inquiry
what
is
it
love
has
father
waked
up
yet
no
dear
wo
he
wake
up
soon
he
sleeping
very
soundly
i
would
like
to
disturb
him
oh
no
do
disturb
him
i
thought
maybe
he
was
awake
and
the
child
lids
drooped
languidly
until
the
long
lashes
lay
close
against
her
cheeks
there
was
silence
for
a
little
while
and
then
morgan
said
in
a
to
slade
oh
we
had
such
a
dreadful
time
with
poor
joe
he
got
in
that
terrible
way
again
last
night
i
had
to
go
for
doctor
green
and
leave
him
all
alone
when
i
came
back
he
was
in
bed
with
mary
and
she
dear
child
had
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
was
trying
to
comfort
him
and
would
you
believe
it
he
went
off
to
sleep
and
slept
in
that
way
for
a
long
time
the
doctor
came
and
when
he
saw
how
it
was
left
some
medicine
for
him
and
went
away
i
was
in
such
hopes
that
he
would
sleep
it
all
off
but
about
twelve
he
started
up
and
sprung
out
of
bed
with
an
awful
scream
poor
mary
she
too
had
fallen
asleep
the
cry
wakened
her
and
frightened
her
dreadfully
she
been
getting
worse
ever
since
slade
just
as
he
was
rushing
out
of
the
room
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
it
took
all
my
strength
to
hold
him
father
mary
called
after
him
as
soon
as
she
was
awake
enough
to
understand
what
was
the
matter
go
out
father
there
nothing
here
he
looked
back
toward
the
bed
in
a
frightful
way
father
and
the
dear
child
turned
down
the
quilt
and
sheet
in
order
to
convince
him
that
nothing
was
in
the
bed
here
she
added
not
afraid
come
father
if
there
nothing
here
to
hurt
me
there
nothing
to
hurt
you
there
was
something
so
assuring
in
this
that
joe
took
a
step
or
two
toward
the
bed
looking
sharply
into
it
as
he
did
so
from
the
bed
his
eyes
wandered
up
to
the
ceiling
and
the
old
look
of
terror
came
into
his
face
it
is
now
jump
out
of
bed
quick
jump
out
mary
he
cried
it
right
over
your
head
mary
showed
no
sign
of
fear
as
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
gazed
steadily
for
a
few
moments
in
that
direction
nothing
there
father
said
she
in
a
confident
voice
gone
now
joe
spoke
in
a
tone
of
relief
drove
it
away
aha
there
it
is
now
creeping
along
the
floor
he
suddenly
exclaimed
fearfully
starting
away
from
where
he
stood
father
here
mary
called
to
him
and
he
sprung
into
the
bed
again
while
she
gathered
her
arms
about
him
tightly
saying
in
a
low
soothing
voice
can
harm
you
here
father
without
a
moment
delay
i
gave
him
the
morphine
left
by
doctor
green
he
took
it
eagerly
and
then
crouched
down
in
the
bed
while
mary
continued
to
assure
him
of
perfect
safety
so
long
as
he
was
clearly
conscious
as
to
where
he
was
he
remained
perfectly
still
but
as
soon
as
partial
slumber
came
he
would
scream
out
and
spring
from
the
bed
in
terror
and
then
it
would
take
us
several
minutes
to
quiet
him
again
six
times
during
the
night
did
this
occur
and
as
often
mary
coaxed
him
back
the
morphine
i
continued
to
give
as
the
doctor
had
directed
by
morning
the
opiates
had
done
their
work
and
he
was
sleeping
soundly
when
the
doctor
came
we
removed
him
to
his
own
bed
he
is
still
asleep
and
i
begin
to
feel
uneasy
lest
he
should
never
awake
again
i
have
heard
of
this
happening
see
if
father
is
awake
said
mary
raising
her
head
from
the
pillow
she
had
not
heard
what
passed
between
her
mother
and
slade
for
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
low
voices
morgan
stepped
to
the
door
and
looked
into
the
room
where
her
husband
lay
he
is
still
asleep
dear
she
remarked
coming
back
to
the
bed
oh
i
wish
he
was
awake
i
want
to
see
him
so
much
wo
you
call
him
mother
i
have
called
him
a
good
many
times
but
you
know
the
doctor
gave
him
opium
he
ca
wake
up
yet
he
been
sleeping
a
very
long
time
do
you
think
so
mother
yes
dear
it
does
seem
a
long
time
but
it
is
best
for
him
he
be
better
when
he
wakes
mary
closed
her
eyes
wearily
how
deathly
white
was
her
face
how
sunken
her
eyes
how
sharply
contracted
her
features
i
given
her
up
slade
said
morgan
in
a
low
rough
choking
whisper
as
she
leaned
nearer
to
her
friend
i
given
her
up
the
worst
is
over
but
oh
it
seemed
as
though
my
heart
would
break
in
the
struggle
dear
child
in
all
the
darkness
of
my
way
she
has
helped
and
comforted
me
without
her
it
would
have
been
the
blackness
of
darkness
father
father
the
voice
of
mary
broke
out
with
a
startling
quickness
morgan
turned
to
the
bed
and
laying
her
hand
on
mary
arm
said
he
still
sound
asleep
dear
no
he
is
mother
i
heard
him
move
wo
you
go
in
and
see
if
he
is
awake
in
order
to
satisfy
the
child
her
mother
left
the
room
to
her
surprise
she
met
the
eyes
of
her
husband
as
she
entered
the
chamber
where
he
lay
he
looked
at
her
calmly
what
does
mary
want
with
me
he
asked
she
wishes
to
see
you
she
called
you
so
many
times
shall
i
bring
her
in
here

i
get
up
and

the
clear
earnest
voice
of
mary
was
heard
calling
i
coming
dear
answered
morgan
come
quick
father
wo
you
yes
love
and
morgan
got
up
and
dressed
himself
but
with
unsteady
hands
and
every
sign
of
nervous
prostration
in
a
little
while
with
the
assistance
of
his
wife
he
was
ready
and
supported
by
her
came
tottering
into
the
room
where
mary
was
lying
oh
father
what
a
light
broke
over
her
i
been
waiting
for
you
so
long
i
thought
you
were
never
going
to
wake
up
kiss
me
father
what
can
i
do
for
you
mary
asked
morgan
tenderly
as
he
laid
his
face
down
upon
the
pillow
beside
her
nothing
father
i
do
wish
for
anything
i
only
wanted
to
see
you
i
here
now
love
dear
father
how
earnestly
yet
tenderly
she
spoke
laying
her
small
hand
upon
his
face
you
always
been
good
to
me
father
oh
no
i
never
been
good
to
anybody
sobbed
the
weak
man
as
he
raised
himself
from
the
pillow
how
deeply
touched
was
slade
as
she
sat
the
silent
witness
of
this
scene
you
have
been
good
to
yourself
father
but
you
always
been
good
to
us
do
mary
do
say
anything
about
that
interrupted
morgan
say
that
i
been
very
bad
very
wicked
oh
mary
dear
i
only
wish
that
i
was
as
good
as
you
are
i
like
to
die
then
and
go
right
away
from
this
evil
world
i
wish
there
was
no
liquor
to
drink
no
taverns
no
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
the
weak
trembling
man
laid
his
face
again
upon
the
pillow
beside
his
child
and
sobbed
aloud
what
an
oppressive
silence
reigned
for
a
time
through
the
room
father
the
stillness
was
broken
by
mary
her
voice
was
clear
and
even
father
i
want
to
tell
you
something
what
is
it
mary
there
be
nobody
to
go
for
you
father
the
child
lips
now
quivered
and
tears
filled
into
her
eyes
do
talk
about
that
mary
i
not
going
out
in
the
evening
any
more
until
you
get
well
do
you
remember
i
promised
but
father
she
hesitated
what
dear
i
going
away
to
leave
you
and
mother
oh
no
no
no
mary
do
say
that
the
poor
man
voice
was
do
say
that
we
ca
let
you
go
dear
god
has
called
me
the
child
voice
had
a
solemn
tone
and
her
eyes
turned
reverently
upward
i
wish
he
would
call
me
oh
i
wish
he
would
call
me
groaned
morgan
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
what
shall
i
do
when
you
are
gone
oh
dear
oh
dear
father
mary
spoke
calmly
again
you
are
not
ready
to
go
yet
god
will
let
you
live
here
longer
that
you
may
get
ready
how
can
i
get
ready
without
you
to
help
me
mary
my
angel
child
have
i
tried
to
help
you
father
oh
so
many
times
said
mary
yes
yes
you
always
tried
but
it
was
any
use
you
would
go
out
you
would
go
to
the
tavern
it
seemed
most
as
if
you
could
help
it
morgan
groaned
in
spirit
maybe
i
can
help
you
better
father
after
i
die
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
am
sure
god
will
let
me
come
to
you
and
stay
with
you
always
and
be
your
angel
do
you
think
he
will
mother
but
morgan
heart
was
too
full
she
did
not
even
try
to
answer
but
sat
with
streaming
eyes
gazing
upon
her
child
face
father
i
dreamed
something
about
you
while
i
slept
mary
again
turned
to
her
father
what
was
it
dear
i
thought
it
was
night
and
that
i
was
still
sick
you
promised
not
to
go
out
again
until
i
was
well
but
you
did
go
out
and
i
thought
you
went
over
to
slade
tavern
when
i
knew
this
i
felt
as
strong
as
when
i
was
well
and
i
got
up
and
dressed
myself
and
started
out
after
you
but
i
had
gone
far
before
i
met
slade
great
nero
and
he
growled
at
me
so
dreadfully
that
i
was
frightened
and
ran
back
home
then
i
started
again
and
went
away
round
by
mason
but
there
was
nero
in
the
road
and
this
time
he
caught
my
dress
in
his
mouth
and
tore
a
great
piece
out
of
the
skirt
i
ran
back
again
and
he
chased
me
all
the
way
home
just
as
i
got
to
the
door
i
looked
around
and
there
was
slade
setting
nero
on
me
as
soon
as
i
saw
slade
though
he
looked
at
me
very
wicked
i
lost
all
my
fear
and
turning
around
i
walked
past
nero
who
showed
his
teeth
and
growled
as
fiercely
as
ever
but
did
touch
me
then
slade
tried
to
stop
me
but
i
did
mind
him
and
kept
right
on
until
i
came
to
the
tavern
and
there
you
stood
in
the
door
and
you
were
dressed
so
nice
you
had
on
a
new
hat
and
a
new
coat
and
your
boots
were
new
and
polished
just
like
judge
hammond
i
said
father
is
this
you
and
then
you
took
me
up
in
your
arms
and
kissed
me
and
said
mary
i
am
your
real
father
not
old
joe
morgan
but
morgan
now
it
seemed
all
so
strange
that
i
looked
into
the
to
see
who
was
there
but
it
was
a
any
longer
but
a
store
full
of
goods
the
sign
of
the
and
sheaf
was
taken
down
and
over
the
door
i
now
read
your
name
father
oh
i
was
so
glad
that
i
awoke
and
then
i
cried
all
to
myself
for
it
was
only
a
dream
the
last
words
were
said
very
mournfully
and
with
a
drooping
of
lids
until
the
lashes
lay
close
upon
her
cheeks
another
period
of
deep
silence
followed
for
the
oppressed
listeners
gave
no
utterance
to
what
was
in
their
hearts
feeling
was
too
strong
for
speech
nearly
five
minutes
glided
away
and
then
mary
whispered
the
name
of
her
father
but
without
opening
her
eyes
morgan
answered
and
bent
down
his
ear
you
will
only
have
mother
left
she
said
only
mother
and
she
cries
so
much
when
you
are
away
i
wo
leave
her
mary
only
when
i
go
to
work
said
morgan
whispering
back
to
the
child
and
i
never
go
out
at
night
any
more
yes
you
promised
me
that
and
i
promise
more
what
father
never
to
go
into
a
tavern
again
never
no
never
and
i
promise
still
more
father
never
to
drink
a
drop
of
liquor
as
long
as
i
live
oh
father
dear
dear
father
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
mary
started
up
and
flung
herself
upon
his
breast
morgan
drew
his
arms
tightly
around
her
and
sat
for
a
long
time
with
his
lips
pressed
to
her
cheek
while
she
lay
against
his
bosom
as
still
as
death
as
death
yes
for
when
the
father
unclasped
his
arms
the
spirit
of
his
child
was
with
the
angels
of
the
resurrection
it
was
my
fourth
evening
in
the
of
the
and
sheaf
the
company
was
not
large
nor
in
very
gay
spirits
all
had
heard
of
little
mary
illness
which
followed
so
quickly
on
the
blow
from
the
tumbler
that
none
hesitated
about
connecting
the
one
with
the
other
so
regular
had
been
the
child
visits
and
so
gently
excited
yet
powerful
her
influence
over
her
father
that
most
of
the
frequenters
at
the
and
sheaf
had
felt
for
her
a
more
than
common
interest
which
the
cruel
treatment
she
received
and
the
subsequent
illness
materially
heightened
joe
morgan
has
turned
up
this
evening
remarked
some
one
and
is
likely
to
for
a
while
was
answered
why
not
inquired
the
first
speaker
they
say
the
man
with
the
poker
is
after
him
oh
dear
that
dreadful
its
the
second
or
third
chase
is
it
yes
he
be
likely
to
catch
him
this
time
i
should
wonder
poor
devil
it
wo
be
much
matter
his
family
will
be
a
great
deal
better
without
him
it
will
be
a
blessing
to
them
if
he
dies
miserable
drunken
wretch
muttered
harvey
green
who
was
present
he
only
in
the
way
of
everybody
the
sooner
he
off
the
better
the
landlord
said
nothing
he
stood
leaning
across
the
bar
looking
more
sober
than
usual
that
was
rather
an
unlucky
affair
of
yours
simon
they
say
the
child
is
going
to
die
who
says
so
slade
started
scowled
and
threw
a
quick
glance
upon
the
speaker
doctor
green
nonsense
doctor
green
never
said
any
such
thing
yes
he
did
though
who
heard
him
i
did
you
did
yes
he
was
in
earnest
a
slight
paleness
overspread
the
countenance
of
the
landlord
he
was
though
they
had
an
awful
time
there
last
night
where
at
joe
morgan
joe
has
the
mania
and
morgan
was
alone
with
him
and
her
sick
girl
all
night
he
deserves
to
have
it
that
all
i
got
to
say
slade
tried
to
speak
with
a
kind
of
rough
indifference
that
pretty
hard
talk
said
one
of
the
company
i
do
care
if
it
is
it
the
truth
what
else
could
he
expect
a
man
like
joe
is
to
be
pitied
remarked
the
other
i
pity
his
family
said
slade
especially
little
mary
the
words
were
uttered
tauntingly
and
produced
murmurs
of
satisfaction
throughout
the
room
slade
started
back
from
where
he
stood
in
an
impatient
manner
saying
something
that
i
did
not
hear
look
here
simon
i
heard
some
strong
suggestions
over
at
lawyer
phillips
office
slade
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
speaker
if
that
child
should
die
you
probably
have
to
stand
a
trial
for
no
said
harvey
green
with
a
cold
inhuman
chuckle
but
i
in
earnest
said
the
other
phillips
said
that
a
case
could
be
made
out
of
it
it
was
only
an
accident
and
all
the
lawyers
in
christendom
ca
make
anything
more
of
it
remarked
green
taking
the
side
of
the
landlord
and
speaking
with
more
gravity
than
before
hardly
an
accident
was
replied
he
did
throw
at
the
girl
no
matter
he
threw
a
heavy
tumbler
at
her
father
head
the
intention
was
to
do
an
injury
and
the
law
will
not
stop
to
make
any
nice
discriminations
in
regard
to
the
individual
upon
whom
the
injury
was
wrought
moreover
who
is
prepared
to
say
that
he
did
aim
at
the
girl
any
man
who
intimates
such
a
thing
is
a
cursed
liar
exclaimed
the
landlord
half
maddened
by
the
suggestion
i
wo
throw
a
tumbler
at
your
head
coolly
remarked
the
individual
whose
plain
speaking
had
so
irritated
simon
slade
throwing
tumblers
i
never
thought
a
very
creditable
kind
of
argument
though
with
some
men
when
cornered
it
is
a
favorite
mode
of
settling
a
question
now
as
for
our
friend
the
landlord
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
his
new
business
does
seem
to
have
improved
his
manners
or
his
temper
a
great
deal
as
a
miller
he
was
one
of
the
men
in
the
world
and
would
have
harmed
a
kitten
but
now
he
can
swear
and
bluster
and
throw
glasses
at
people
heads
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
with
the
best
of
brawling
rowdies
i
afraid
he
taking
lessons
in
a
bad
school
i
am
i
do
think
you
have
any
right
to
insult
a
man
in
his
own
house
answered
slade
in
a
voice
dropped
to
a
lower
key
than
the
one
in
which
he
had
before
spoken
i
had
no
intention
to
insult
you
said
the
other
i
was
only
speaking
supposititiously
and
in
view
of
your
position
on
a
trial
for
manslaughter
when
i
suggested
that
no
one
could
prove
or
say
that
you
did
mean
to
strike
little
mary
when
you
threw
the
tumbler
well
i
did
mean
to
strike
her
and
i
do
believe
there
is
a
man
in
this
who
thinks
that
i
did
not
one
i
sure
i
do
not
said
the
individual
with
whom
he
was
in
controversy
nor
i
nor
i
went
round
the
room
but
as
i
wished
to
set
forth
was
continued
the
case
will
not
be
so
plain
a
one
when
it
finds
its
way
into
court
and
twelve
men
to
each
of
whom
you
may
be
a
stranger
come
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
the
act
the
slightest
twist
in
the
evidence
the
prepossessions
of
a
witness
or
the
bad
tact
of
the
prosecution
may
cause
things
to
look
so
dark
on
your
side
as
to
leave
you
but
little
chance
for
my
part
if
the
child
should
die
i
think
your
chances
for
a
term
in
the
prison
are
as
eight
to
ten
and
i
should
call
that
pretty
close
cutting
i
looked
attentively
at
the
man
who
said
this
all
the
while
he
was
speaking
but
could
not
clearly
make
out
whether
he
were
altogether
in
earnest
or
merely
trying
to
worry
the
mind
of
slade
that
he
was
successful
in
accomplishing
the
latter
was
very
plain
for
the
landlord
countenance
steadily
lost
color
and
became
overcast
with
alarm
with
that
evil
delight
which
some
men
take
in
giving
pain
others
seeing
slade
anxious
looks
joined
in
the
persecution
and
soon
made
the
landlord
case
look
black
enough
and
the
landlord
himself
almost
as
frightened
as
a
criminal
just
under
arrest
it
bad
business
and
no
mistake
said
one
yes
bad
enough
i
would
be
in
his
shoes
for
his
coat
remarked
another
for
his
coat
no
not
for
his
whole
wardrobe
said
a
third
nor
for
the
and
sheaf
thrown
into
the
bargain
added
a
fourth
it
will
be
a
clear
case
of
manslaughter
and
no
mistake
what
is
the
penalty
from
two
to
ten
years
in
the
penitentiary
was
readily
answered
they
give
him
five
i
reckon
no
not
more
than
two
it
will
be
hard
to
prove
malicious
intention
i
do
know
that
i
heard
him
curse
the
girl
and
threaten
her
many
a
time
have
you
yes
yes
i
have
often
ran
round
the
you
better
hang
me
at
once
said
slade
affecting
to
laugh
at
this
moment
the
door
behind
slade
opened
and
i
saw
his
anxious
face
thrust
in
for
a
moment
she
said
something
to
her
husband
who
uttered
a
low
ejaculation
of
surprise
and
went
out
quickly
what
the
matter
now
asked
one
of
another
i
should
wonder
if
little
mary
morgan
was
dead
was
suggested
i
heard
her
say
dead
remarked
one
who
was
standing
near
the
bar
what
the
matter
frank
inquired
several
voices
as
the
son
came
in
through
the
door
out
of
which
his
father
had
passed
mary
morgan
is
dead
answered
the
boy
poor
child
poor
child
sighed
one
in
genuine
regret
at
the
not
unlooked
for
intelligence
her
trouble
is
over
and
there
was
not
one
present
but
harvey
green
who
did
not
utter
some
word
of
pity
or
sympathy
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
as
much
of
contempt
and
indifference
as
he
thought
it
prudent
to
express
see
here
boys
spoke
out
one
of
the
company
ca
we
do
something
for
poor
morgan
ca
we
make
up
a
purse
for
her
that
it
was
quickly
responded
i
good
for
three
dollars
and
there
they
are
drawing
out
the
money
and
laying
it
upon
the
counter
and
here
are
five
to
go
with
them
said
i
quickly
stepping
forward
and
placing
a
bill
along
side
of
the
first
contribution
here
are
five
more
added
a
third
individual
and
so
it
went
on
until
thirty
dollars
were
paid
down
for
the
benefit
of
morgan
into
whose
hands
shall
this
be
placed
was
next
asked
let
me
suggest
slade
said
i
to
my
certain
knowledge
she
has
been
with
morgan
i
know
that
she
feels
in
her
a
true
woman
interest
just
the
person
was
answered
frank
tell
your
mother
we
would
like
to
see
her
ask
her
to
step
into
the
in
a
few
moments
the
boy
came
back
and
said
that
his
mother
would
see
us
in
the
next
room
into
which
we
all
passed
slade
stood
near
the
table
on
which
burned
a
lamp
i
noticed
that
her
eyes
were
red
and
that
there
was
on
her
countenance
a
troubled
and
sorrowful
expression
we
have
just
heard
said
one
of
the
company
that
little
mary
morgan
is
dead
yes
it
is
too
true
answered
slade
mournfully
i
have
just
left
there
poor
child
she
has
passed
from
an
evil
world
evil
it
has
indeed
been
to
her
was
remarked
you
may
well
say
that
and
yet
amid
all
the
evil
she
been
an
angel
of
mercy
her
last
thought
in
dying
was
of
her
miserable
father
for
him
at
any
time
she
would
have
laid
down
her
life
willingly
her
mother
must
be
nearly
mary
is
the
last
of
her
children
and
yet
the
child
death
may
prove
a
blessing
to
her
how
so
her
father
promised
mary
just
at
the
last
moment
solemnly
promised
her
that
henceforth
he
would
never
taste
liquor
that
was
all
her
trouble
that
was
the
thorn
in
her
dying
pillow
but
he
plucked
it
out
and
she
went
to
sleep
lying
against
his
heart
oh
gentlemen
it
was
the
most
touching
sight
i
ever
saw
all
present
seemed
deeply
moved
they
are
very
poor
and
wretched
was
said
poor
and
miserable
enough
answered
slade
we
have
just
been
taking
up
a
collection
for
morgan
here
is
the
money
slade
thirty
dollars
we
place
it
in
your
hands
for
her
benefit
do
with
it
for
her
as
you
may
see
best
oh
gentlemen
what
a
quick
gleam
went
over
the
face
of
slade
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
in
the
name
of
that
unhappy
one
for
this
act
of
true
benevolence
to
you
the
sacrifice
has
been
small
to
her
the
benefit
will
be
great
indeed
a
new
life
will
i
trust
be
commenced
by
her
husband
and
this
timely
aid
will
be
something
to
rest
upon
until
he
can
get
into
better
employment
than
he
now
has
oh
gentlemen
let
me
urge
on
you
one
and
all
to
make
common
cause
in
favor
of
joe
morgan
his
purposes
are
good
now
he
means
to
keep
his
promise
to
his
dying
child
means
to
reform
his
life
let
good
impulses
that
led
to
that
act
of
relief
further
prompt
you
to
watch
over
him
and
if
you
see
him
about
going
astray
to
lead
him
kindly
back
into
the
right
path
never
oh
never
encourage
him
to
drink
but
rather
take
the
glass
from
his
hand
if
his
own
appetite
lead
him
aside
and
by
all
the
persuasive
influence
you
possess
induce
him
to
go
out
from
the
place
of
temptation
pardon
my
boldness
in
saying
so
much
added
slade
recollecting
herself
and
coloring
deeply
as
she
did
so
my
feelings
have
led
me
away
and
she
took
the
money
from
the
table
where
it
had
been
placed
and
retired
toward
the
door
you
have
spoken
well
madam
was
answered
and
we
thank
you
for
reminding
us
of
our
duty
one
word
more
and
forgive
the
earnest
heart
from
which
it
comes
said
slade
in
a
voice
that
trembled
on
the
words
she
uttered
i
can
not
help
speaking
gentlemen
think
if
some
of
you
be
not
entering
the
road
wherein
joe
morgan
has
so
long
been
walking
save
him
in
heaven
name
but
see
that
ye
do
not
yourselves
become
castaways
as
she
said
this
she
glided
through
the
door
and
it
closed
after
her
i
do
know
what
her
husband
would
say
to
that
was
remarked
after
a
few
moments
of
surprised
silence
i
do
care
what
he
would
say
but
i
tell
you
what
will
say
spoke
out
a
man
whom
i
had
several
times
noticed
as
a
rather
a
free
tippler
the
old
lady
has
given
us
capital
advice
and
i
mean
to
take
it
for
one
i
going
to
try
to
save
joe
morgan
and
myself
too
already
entered
the
road
she
referred
to
but
i
going
to
turn
back
so
to
you
all
and
if
simon
slade
gets
no
more
of
my
sixpences
he
may
thank
his
wife
for
it
god
bless
her
and
the
man
drew
his
hat
with
a
jerk
over
his
forehead
and
left
immediately
this
seemed
the
signal
for
dispersion
and
all
retired
not
by
way
of
the
but
out
into
the
hall
and
through
the
door
leading
upon
the
porch
that
ran
along
in
front
of
the
house
soon
after
the
bar
was
closed
and
a
dead
silence
reigned
throughout
the
house
i
saw
no
more
of
slade
that
night
early
in
the
morning
i
left
cedarville
the
landlord
looked
very
sober
when
he
bade
me
through
the
and
wished
me
a
pleasant
journey
night
the
fifth
some
of
the
consequences
of
nearly
five
years
glided
away
before
business
again
called
me
to
cedarville
i
knew
little
of
what
passed
there
in
the
interval
except
that
simon
slade
had
actually
been
indicted
for
manslaughter
in
causing
the
death
of
morgan
child
he
did
not
stand
a
trial
however
judge
lyman
having
used
his
influence
successfully
in
getting
the
indictment
quashed
the
judge
some
people
said
interested
himself
in
slade
more
than
was
just
seemly
especially
as
he
had
on
several
occasions
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
displayed
what
seemed
an
indignation
against
individuals
arraigned
for
petty
offences
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
judge
lyman
had
not
been
favorable
he
seemed
a
cold
selfish
scheming
man
of
the
world
that
he
was
an
unscrupulous
politician
was
plain
to
me
in
a
single
evening
observation
of
his
sayings
and
doings
among
the
common
herd
of
a
village
as
the
stage
rolled
with
a
gay
flourish
of
our
driver
bugle
into
the
village
i
noted
here
and
there
familiar
objects
and
marked
the
varied
evidences
of
change
our
way
was
past
the
elegant
residence
and
grounds
of
judge
hammond
the
most
beautiful
and
highly
cultivated
in
cedarville
at
least
such
it
was
regarded
at
the
time
of
my
previous
visit
but
the
moment
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
dwelling
and
its
various
surroundings
i
perceived
an
altered
aspect
was
it
the
simple
work
of
time
or
had
familiarity
with
other
and
more
elegantly
arranged
suburban
homes
marred
this
in
my
eyes
by
involuntary
contrast
or
had
the
hand
of
cultivation
really
been
stayed
and
the
marring
fingers
of
neglect
suffered
undisturbed
to
trace
on
every
thing
disfiguring
characters
such
questions
were
in
my
thoughts
when
i
saw
a
man
in
the
large
portico
of
the
dwelling
the
ample
columns
of
which
capped
in
rich
corinthian
gave
the
edifice
the
aspect
of
a
grecian
temple
he
stood
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
his
hat
off
and
his
long
gray
hair
thrown
back
and
resting
lightly
on
his
neck
and
shoulders
his
head
was
bent
down
upon
his
breast
and
he
seemed
in
deep
abstraction
just
as
the
coach
swept
by
he
looked
up
and
in
the
changed
features
i
recognized
judge
hammond
his
complexion
was
still
florid
but
his
face
had
grown
thin
and
his
eyes
were
sunken
trouble
was
written
in
every
lineament
trouble
how
inadequately
does
the
word
express
my
meaning
ah
at
a
single
glance
what
a
volume
of
suffering
was
opened
to
the
gazer
eye
not
lightly
had
the
foot
of
time
rested
there
as
if
treading
on
odorous
flowers
but
heavily
and
with
heel
this
i
saw
at
a
glance
and
then
only
the
image
of
the
man
was
present
to
my
inner
vision
for
the
swiftly
rolling
had
borne
me
onward
past
the
altered
home
of
the
wealthiest
denizen
of
cedarville
in
a
few
minutes
our
driver
reined
up
before
the
sickle
and
sheaf
and
as
i
stepped
to
the
ground
a
rotund
coarse
man
whom
i
failed
to
recognize
as
simon
slade
until
he
spoke
grasped
my
hand
and
pronounced
my
name
i
could
not
but
contrast
in
thought
his
appearance
with
what
it
was
when
i
first
saw
him
some
six
years
previously
nor
help
saying
to
myself
so
much
for
as
marked
a
change
was
visible
everywhere
in
and
around
the
sickle
and
sheaf
it
too
had
grown
larger
by
additions
of
wings
and
rooms
but
it
had
also
grown
coarser
in
growing
larger
when
built
all
the
doors
were
painted
white
and
the
shutters
green
giving
to
the
house
a
neat
even
tasteful
appearance
but
the
white
and
green
had
given
place
to
a
dark
dirty
brown
that
to
my
eyes
was
particularly
unattractive
the
had
been
extended
and
now
a
polished
brass
rod
or
railing
embellished
the
counter
and
sundry
ornamental
attractions
had
been
given
to
the
shelving
behind
the
bar
such
as
mirrors
gilding
etc
pictures
too
were
hung
upon
the
walls
or
more
accurately
speaking
coarse
colored
lithographs
the
subjects
of
which
if
not
really
obscene
were
flashing
or
vulgar
in
the
next
to
the
bar
i
noticed
little
change
of
objects
but
much
in
their
condition
the
carpet
chairs
and
tables
were
the
same
in
fact
but
far
from
being
the
same
in
appearance
the
room
had
a
close
greasy
odor
and
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
thoroughly
swept
and
dusted
for
a
week
a
smart
young
irishman
was
in
the
bar
and
handed
me
the
book
in
which
passenger
names
were
registered
after
i
had
recorded
mine
he
directed
my
trunk
to
be
carried
to
the
room
designated
as
the
one
i
was
to
occupy
i
followed
the
porter
who
conducted
me
to
the
chamber
which
had
been
mine
at
previous
visits
here
too
were
evidences
of
change
but
not
for
the
better
then
the
room
was
as
sweet
and
clean
as
it
could
be
the
sheets
and
as
white
as
snow
and
the
furniture
shining
with
polish
now
all
was
dusty
and
dingy
the
air
foul
and
the
scarcely
whiter
than
tow
no
curtain
made
softer
the
light
as
it
came
through
the
window
nor
would
the
shutters
entirely
keep
out
the
glare
for
several
of
the
slats
were
broken
a
feeling
of
disgust
came
over
me
at
the
close
smell
and
foul
appearance
of
everything
so
after
washing
my
hands
and
face
and
brushing
the
dust
from
my
clothes
i
went
down
stairs
the
was
scarcely
more
attractive
than
my
chamber
so
i
went
out
upon
the
porch
and
took
a
chair
several
loungers
were
here
hearty
but
lazy
fellows
who
if
they
had
anything
to
do
liked
idling
better
than
working
one
of
them
leaned
his
chair
back
against
the
wall
of
the
house
and
was
swinging
his
legs
with
a
half
circular
motion
and
humming
old
folks
at
home
another
sat
astride
of
a
chair
with
his
face
turned
toward
and
his
chin
resting
upon
the
back
he
was
in
too
lazy
a
condition
of
body
and
mind
for
motion
or
singing
a
third
had
slidden
down
in
his
chair
until
he
sat
on
his
back
while
his
feet
were
elevated
above
his
head
and
rested
against
one
of
the
pillars
that
supported
the
porch
while
a
fourth
lay
stretched
out
on
a
bench
sleeping
his
hat
over
his
face
to
protect
him
from
buzzing
and
biting
flies
though
all
but
the
sleeping
man
eyed
me
inquisitively
as
i
took
my
place
among
them
not
one
changed
his
position
the
rolling
of
cost
but
little
exertion
and
with
that
effort
they
were
contented
hallo
who
that
one
of
these
loungers
suddenly
exclaimed
as
a
man
went
swiftly
by
in
a
light
sulky
and
he
started
up
and
gazed
down
the
road
seeking
to
penetrate
the
cloud
of
dust
which
the
fleet
rider
had
swept
up
with
hoofs
and
wheels
i
did
see
the
sleeping
man
aroused
himself
rubbed
his
eyes
and
gazed
along
the
road
who
was
it
matthew
the
irish
now
stood
in
the
door
willy
hammond
was
answered
by
matthew
indeed
is
that
his
new
three
hundred
dollar
horse
yes
my
but
he
a
screamer
is
he
most
as
fast
as
his
young
master
hardly
said
one
of
the
men
laughing
i
do
think
anything
in
creation
can
beat
hammond
he
goes
it
with
a
perfect
rush
does
he
well
you
may
say
what
you
please
of
him
he
as
a
fellow
as
ever
walked
and
generous
to
a
fault
his
old
dad
will
agree
with
you
in
the
last
remark
said
matthew
no
doubt
of
that
for
he
has
to
stand
the
bills
was
answered
yes
whether
he
will
or
no
for
i
rather
think
willy
has
somehow
or
other
got
the
upper
hand
of
him
in
what
way
it
hammond
and
son
over
at
the
mill
and
distillery
i
know
but
what
of
that
willy
was
made
the
business
man
ostensibly
in
order
as
the
old
man
thought
to
get
him
to
feel
the
responsibility
of
the
new
position
and
thus
tame
him
down
tame
him
down
oh
dear
it
will
take
more
than
business
to
do
that
the
curb
was
applied
too
late
as
the
old
gentleman
has
already
discovered
i
thinking
to
his
sorrow
he
never
comes
here
any
more
does
he
matthew
who
judge
hammond
oh
dear
no
he
and
slade
had
all
sorts
of
a
quarrel
about
a
year
ago
and
he
never
darkened
our
doors
since
it
was
something
about
willy
and
the
speaker
did
not
mention
any
name
but
winked
knowingly
and
tossed
his
head
toward
the
entrance
of
the
house
to
indicate
some
member
of
slade
family
i
believe
so
d
think
willy
really
likes
her
matthew
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
made
no
answer
she
a
nice
girl
was
remarked
in
an
under
tone
and
good
enough
for
hammond
son
any
day
though
if
she
were
my
daughter
i
rather
see
her
in
jericho
than
fond
of
his
company
he
have
plenty
of
money
to
give
her
she
can
live
like
a
queen
for
how
long
hush
came
from
the
lips
of
matthew
there
she
is
now
i
looked
up
and
saw
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
and
approaching
a
young
lady
in
whose
sweet
modest
face
i
at
once
recognized
flora
slade
five
years
had
developed
her
into
a
beautiful
woman
in
her
alone
of
all
that
appertained
to
simon
slade
there
was
no
deterioration
her
eyes
were
as
mild
and
pure
as
when
first
i
met
her
at
gentle
sixteen
and
her
father
said
my
daughter
with
such
a
mingling
of
pride
and
affection
in
his
tone
she
passed
near
where
i
was
sitting
and
entered
the
house
a
closer
view
showed
me
some
marks
of
thought
and
suffering
but
they
only
heightened
the
attraction
of
her
face
i
failed
not
to
observe
the
air
of
respect
with
which
all
returned
her
slight
nod
and
smile
of
recognition
she
a
nice
girl
and
no
mistake
the
flower
of
this
flock
was
said
as
soon
as
she
passed
into
the
house
too
good
for
willy
hammond
in
my
opinion
said
matthew
clever
and
generous
as
people
call
him
just
my
opinion
was
responded
she
as
pure
and
good
almost
as
an
angel
and
he
i
can
tell
you
what
he
not
the
clean
thing
he
knows
a
little
too
much
of
the
world
on
its
bad
side
i
mean
the
appearance
of
slade
put
an
end
to
this
conversation
a
second
observation
of
his
person
and
countenance
did
not
remove
the
first
unfavorable
impression
his
face
had
grown
decidedly
bad
in
expression
as
well
as
gross
and
sensual
the
odor
of
his
breath
as
he
took
a
chair
close
to
where
i
was
sitting
was
that
of
one
who
drank
habitually
and
freely
and
the
red
swimming
eyes
evidenced
too
surely
a
rapid
progress
toward
the
sad
condition
of
a
confirmed
inebriate
there
was
too
a
certain
thickness
of
speech
that
gave
another
corroborating
sign
of
evil
progress
have
you
seen
anything
of
frank
this
afternoon
he
inquired
of
matthew
after
we
had
passed
a
few
words
nothing
was
the
answer
i
saw
him
with
tom
wilkins
as
i
came
over
said
one
of
the
men
who
was
sitting
in
the
porch
what
was
he
doing
with
tom
wilkins
said
slade
in
a
fretted
tone
of
voice
he
does
seem
very
choice
in
his
company
they
were
gunning
gunning
yes
they
both
had
i
was
near
enough
to
ask
where
they
were
going
this
information
disturbed
slade
a
good
deal
after
muttering
to
himself
a
little
while
he
started
up
and
went
into
the
house
and
i
could
have
told
him
a
little
more
had
i
been
so
inclined
said
the
individual
who
mentioned
the
fact
that
frank
was
with
tom
wilkins
what
more
inquired
matthew
there
was
a
buggy
in
the
case
and
a
champagne
basket
what
the
latter
contained
you
can
easily
guess
whose
buggy
i
do
know
anything
about
the
buggy
but
if
does
sink
in
value
a
hundred
dollars
or
so
before
sundown
call
me
a
false
prophet
oh
no
said
matthew
incredulously
frank
would
do
an
outrageous
thing
like
that
lightfoot
wo
be
in
a
condition
to
drive
for
a
month
to
come
i
do
care
she
out
now
and
the
way
she
was
putting
it
down
when
i
saw
her
would
have
made
a
locomotive
look
cloudy
where
did
he
get
her
was
inquired
she
been
in
the
field
over
by
mason
bridge
for
the
last
week
or
so
matthew
answered
well
all
i
have
to
say
he
added
is
that
frank
ought
to
be
slung
up
and
well
i
never
saw
such
a
young
rascal
he
cares
for
no
good
and
fears
no
evil
he
the
worst
boy
i
ever
saw
it
would
hardly
do
for
you
to
call
him
a
boy
to
his
face
said
one
of
the
men
laughing
i
do
have
much
to
say
to
him
in
any
way
replied
matthew
for
i
know
very
well
that
if
we
ever
do
get
into
a
regular
quarrel
be
a
hard
time
of
it
the
same
house
will
not
hold
us
afterward
certain
so
i
steer
clear
of
the
young
reprobate
i
wonder
his
father
do
put
him
to
some
business
was
remarked
the
idle
life
he
now
leads
will
be
his
ruin
he
was
behind
the
bar
for
a
year
or
two
yes
and
was
smart
at
mixing
a
glass
but
was
himself
becoming
too
good
a
customer
precisely
he
got
drunk
as
a
fool
before
reaching
his
fifteenth
year
good
gracious
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
it
true
sir
said
the
last
speaker
turning
to
me
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
and
this
was
all
talk
which
as
you
may
know
is
the
most
refined
and
virtuous
in
the
world
i
would
like
my
son
to
hear
much
of
it
frank
was
always
an
eager
listener
to
everything
that
was
said
and
in
a
very
short
time
became
an
adept
in
slang
and
profanity
i
no
saint
myself
but
it
often
made
my
blood
run
cold
to
hear
him
swear
i
pity
his
mother
said
i
for
my
thought
turned
naturally
to
slade
you
may
well
do
that
was
answered
i
doubt
if
cedarville
holds
a
sadder
heart
it
was
a
dark
day
for
her
let
me
tell
you
when
simon
slade
sold
his
mill
and
built
this
tavern
she
was
opposed
to
it
at
the
beginning
i
have
inferred
as
much
i
know
it
said
the
man
my
wife
has
been
intimate
with
her
for
years
indeed
they
have
always
been
like
sisters
i
remember
very
well
her
coming
to
our
house
about
the
time
the
mill
was
sold
and
crying
about
it
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
saw
nothing
but
sorrow
and
trouble
ahead
she
had
always
regarded
as
a
low
business
and
the
change
from
a
respectable
miller
to
a
lazy
as
she
expressed
it
was
presented
to
her
mind
as
something
disgraceful
i
remember
very
well
trying
to
argue
the
point
with
her
assuming
that
it
was
quite
as
respectable
to
keep
tavern
as
to
do
anything
else
but
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
wind
she
was
always
a
pleasant
hopeful
cheerful
woman
before
that
time
but
really
i
do
think
i
seen
a
true
smile
on
her
face
since
that
was
a
great
deal
for
a
man
to
lose
said
i
what
he
inquired
not
clearly
understanding
me
the
cheerfull
face
of
his
wife
the
face
was
but
an
index
of
her
heart
said
he
so
much
the
worse
true
enough
for
that
yes
it
was
a
great
deal
to
lose
what
has
he
gained
that
will
make
up
for
this
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
has
he
gained
i
repeated
can
you
figure
it
up
he
a
richer
man
for
one
thing
happier
there
was
another
shrug
of
the
shoulders
i
would
like
to
say
that
how
much
richer
oh
a
great
deal
somebody
was
saying
only
yesterday
that
he
could
be
worth
less
than
thirty
thousand
dollars
indeed
so
much
yes
how
has
he
managed
to
accumulate
so
rapidly
his
bar
has
a
large
run
of
custom
and
you
know
that
pays
wonderfully
he
must
have
sold
a
great
deal
of
liquor
in
six
years
and
he
has
i
do
think
i
wrong
in
saying
that
in
the
six
years
which
have
gone
by
since
the
and
sheaf
was
opened
more
liquor
has
been
drank
than
in
the
previous
twenty
years
say
forty
remarked
a
man
who
had
been
a
listener
to
what
we
said
let
it
be
forty
then
was
the
according
answer
how
comes
this
i
inquired
you
had
a
tavern
here
before
the
and
sheaf
was
opened
i
know
we
had
and
several
places
besides
where
liquor
was
sold
but
everybody
far
and
near
knew
simon
slade
the
miller
and
everybody
liked
him
he
was
a
good
miller
and
a
cheerful
social
chatty
sort
of
man
putting
everybody
in
a
good
humor
who
came
near
him
so
it
became
the
talk
everywhere
when
he
built
this
house
which
he
fitted
up
nicer
than
anything
that
had
been
seen
in
these
parts
judge
hammond
judge
lyman
lawyer
wilson
and
all
the
big
bugs
of
the
place
at
once
patronized
the
new
tavern
and
of
course
everybody
else
did
the
same
so
you
can
easily
see
how
he
got
such
a
run
it
was
thought
in
the
beginning
said
i
that
the
new
tavern
was
going
to
do
wonders
for
cedarville
yes
answered
the
man
laughing
and
so
it
has
in
what
respect
oh
in
many
it
has
made
some
men
richer
and
some
poorer
who
has
it
made
poorer
dozens
of
people
you
may
always
take
it
for
granted
when
you
see
a
who
has
a
good
run
at
his
bar
getting
rich
that
a
great
many
people
are
getting
poor
how
so
i
wished
to
hear
in
what
way
the
man
who
was
himself
as
was
plain
to
see
a
good
customer
at
somebody
bar
reasoned
on
the
subject
he
does
not
add
to
the
general
wealth
he
produces
nothing
he
takes
money
from
his
customers
but
gives
them
no
article
of
value
in
return
nothing
that
can
be
called
property
personal
or
real
he
is
just
so
much
richer
and
they
just
so
much
poorer
for
the
exchange
is
it
not
so
i
readily
assented
to
the
position
as
true
and
then
said
who
in
particular
is
poorer
judge
hammond
for
one
indeed
i
thought
the
advance
in
his
property
in
consequence
of
the
building
of
this
tavern
was
so
great
that
he
was
reaping
a
rich
pecuniary
harvest
there
was
a
slight
advance
in
property
along
the
street
after
the
and
sheaf
was
opened
and
judge
hammond
was
benefited
thereby
interested
parties
made
a
good
deal
of
noise
about
it
but
it
amount
to
much
i
believe
what
has
caused
the
judge
to
grow
poorer
the
opening
of
this
tavern
as
i
just
said
in
what
way
did
it
affect
him
he
was
among
slade
warmest
supporters
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
advance
in
the
price
of
building
lots
called
him
one
of
the
most
enterprising
men
in
cedarville
a
real
benefactor
to
the
place
and
all
that
stuff
to
set
a
good
example
of
patronage
he
came
over
every
day
and
took
his
glass
of
brandy
and
encouraged
everybody
else
that
he
could
influence
to
do
the
same
among
those
who
followed
his
example
was
his
son
willy
there
was
not
let
me
tell
you
in
all
the
country
for
twenty
miles
around
a
finer
young
man
than
willy
nor
one
of
so
much
promise
when
this
he
let
his
voice
fall
and
glanced
around
as
he
thus
designated
slade
tavern
was
opened
and
now
there
is
not
one
dashing
more
recklessly
along
the
road
to
ruin
when
too
late
his
father
saw
that
his
son
was
corrupted
and
that
the
company
he
kept
was
of
a
dangerous
character
two
reasons
led
him
to
purchase
slade
old
mill
and
turn
it
into
a
factory
and
a
distillery
of
course
he
had
to
make
a
heavy
outlay
for
additional
buildings
machinery
and
distilling
apparatus
the
reasons
influencing
him
were
the
prospect
of
realizing
a
large
amount
of
money
especially
in
distilling
and
the
hope
of
saving
willy
by
getting
him
closely
engaged
and
interested
in
business
to
accomplish
more
certainly
the
latter
end
he
unwisely
transferred
to
his
son
as
his
own
capital
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
then
formed
with
him
a
regular
copartnership
giving
willy
an
active
business
control
but
the
experiment
sir
added
the
man
emphatically
has
proved
a
failure
i
heard
yesterday
that
both
mill
and
distillery
were
to
be
shut
up
and
offered
for
sale
they
did
not
prove
as
as
was
anticipated
no
not
under
willy
hammond
management
he
had
made
too
many
bad
acquaintances
men
who
clung
to
him
because
he
had
plenty
of
money
at
his
command
and
spent
it
as
freely
as
water
of
his
time
he
was
away
from
the
mill
and
while
there
did
half
attend
to
business
i
heard
it
said
and
i
do
much
doubt
its
truth
that
he
squandered
his
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
a
great
deal
more
besides
how
is
that
possible
well
people
talk
and
not
always
at
random
there
been
a
man
staying
here
most
of
his
time
for
the
last
four
or
five
years
named
green
he
does
not
do
anything
and
do
seem
to
have
any
friends
in
the
neighborhood
nobody
knows
where
he
came
from
and
he
is
not
at
all
communicative
on
that
head
himself
well
this
man
became
acquainted
with
young
hammond
after
willy
got
to
visiting
the
bar
here
and
attached
himself
to
him
at
once
they
have
to
all
appearance
been
fast
friends
ever
since
riding
about
or
going
off
on
gunning
or
fishing
excursions
almost
every
day
and
secluding
themselves
somewhere
nearly
every
evening
that
man
green
sir
it
is
whispered
is
a
gambler
and
i
believe
it
granted
and
there
is
no
longer
a
mystery
as
to
what
willy
does
with
his
own
and
his
father
money
i
readily
assented
to
this
view
of
the
case
and
so
assuming
that
green
is
a
gambler
said
i
he
has
grown
richer
in
consequence
of
the
opening
of
a
new
and
more
attractive
tavern
in
cedarville
yes
and
cedarville
is
so
much
the
poorer
for
all
his
gains
for
never
heard
of
his
buying
a
foot
of
ground
or
in
any
way
encouraging
productive
industry
he
only
a
it
is
worse
than
the
mere
abstraction
of
money
i
remarked
he
corrupts
his
victims
at
the
same
time
that
he
robs
them
true
willy
hammond
may
not
be
his
only
victim
i
suggested
nor
is
he
in
my
opinion
i
been
coming
to
this
bar
nightly
for
a
good
many
years
a
sorry
confession
for
a
man
to
make
i
must
own
he
added
with
a
slight
tinge
of
shame
but
so
it
is
well
as
i
was
saying
i
been
coming
to
this
bar
nightly
for
a
good
many
years
and
i
generally
see
all
that
is
going
on
around
me
among
the
regular
visitors
are
at
least
half
a
dozen
young
men
belonging
to
our
best
families
who
have
been
raised
with
care
and
well
educated
that
their
presence
here
is
unknown
to
their
friends
i
am
quite
certain
or
at
least
unknown
and
unsuspected
by
some
of
them
they
do
not
drink
a
great
deal
yet
but
all
try
a
glass
or
two
toward
nine
often
at
an
earlier
hour
you
will
see
one
and
another
of
them
go
quietly
out
of
the
bar
through
the
preceded
or
soon
followed
by
green
and
slade
at
any
hour
of
the
night
up
to
one
or
two
and
sometimes
three
you
can
see
light
streaming
through
the
rent
in
a
curtain
drawn
before
a
particular
window
which
i
know
to
be
in
the
room
of
harvey
green
these
are
facts
sir
and
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusion
i
think
it
a
very
serious
matter
why
does
slade
go
out
with
these
young
men
i
inquired
do
you
think
he
gambles
also
if
he
is
a
kind
of
a
for
harvey
green
then
mistaken
again
hardly
he
can
not
already
have
become
so
utterly
unprincipled
it
a
bad
school
sir
this
said
the
man
i
readily
grant
you
that
and
it
nearly
seven
years
since
he
commenced
to
take
lessons
a
great
deal
may
be
learned
sir
of
good
or
evil
in
seven
years
especially
if
any
interest
be
taken
in
the
studies
true
and
it
true
in
this
case
you
may
depend
upon
it
simon
slade
is
not
the
man
he
was
seven
years
ago
anybody
with
half
an
eye
can
see
that
he
grown
selfish
grasping
unscrupulous
and
passionate
there
could
hardly
be
a
greater
difference
between
men
than
exists
between
simon
slade
the
and
simon
slade
the
miller
and
intemperate
also
i
suggested
he
beginning
to
take
a
little
too
much
was
answered
in
that
case
he
scarcely
be
as
well
off
five
years
hence
as
he
is
now
he
at
the
top
of
the
wheel
some
of
us
think
what
has
led
to
this
opinion
he
beginning
to
neglect
his
house
for
one
thing
a
bad
sign
and
there
is
another
sign
heretofore
he
has
always
been
on
hand
with
the
cash
when
desirable
property
went
off
under
forced
sale
at
a
bargain
in
the
last
three
or
four
months
several
great
sacrifices
have
been
made
but
simon
slade
showed
no
inclination
to
buy
put
this
fact
against
another
week
before
last
he
sold
a
house
and
lot
in
the
town
for
five
hundred
dollars
less
than
he
paid
for
them
a
year
ago
and
for
just
that
sum
less
than
their
true
value
how
came
that
i
inquired
ah
there
the
question
he
wanted
money
though
for
what
purpose
he
has
not
intimated
to
any
one
as
far
as
i
can
learn
what
do
you
think
of
it
just
this
he
and
green
have
been
hunting
together
in
times
past
but
the
professed
gambler
instincts
are
too
strong
to
let
him
spare
even
his
friend
in
evil
they
have
commenced
playing
one
against
the
other
ah
you
think
so
i
do
and
if
i
conjecture
rightly
simon
slade
will
be
a
poorer
man
in
a
year
from
this
time
than
he
is
now
here
our
conversation
was
interrupted
some
one
asked
my
talkative
friend
to
go
and
take
a
drink
and
he
nothing
loath
left
me
without
ceremony
very
differently
served
was
the
supper
i
partook
of
on
that
evening
from
the
one
set
before
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
to
the
sickle
and
sheaf
the
was
not
merely
soiled
but
offensively
dirty
the
plates
cups
and
saucers
dingy
and
sticky
the
knives
and
forks
unpolished
and
the
food
of
a
character
to
satisfy
the
appetite
with
a
very
few
mouthfuls
two
irish
girls
waited
on
the
table
at
which
neither
landlord
nor
landlady
presided
i
was
really
hungry
when
the
rang
but
the
craving
of
my
stomach
soon
ceased
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
and
i
was
the
first
to
leave
the
table
soon
after
the
lamps
were
lighted
company
began
to
assemble
in
the
spacious
where
were
comfortable
seats
with
tables
newspapers
backgammon
boards
dominoes
etc
the
first
act
of
nearly
every
one
who
came
in
was
to
call
for
a
glass
of
liquor
and
sometimes
the
same
individual
drank
two
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
on
the
invitation
of
new
comers
who
were
convivially
inclined
most
of
those
who
came
in
were
strangers
to
me
i
was
looking
from
face
to
face
to
see
if
any
of
the
old
company
were
present
when
one
countenance
struck
me
as
familiar
i
was
studying
it
in
order
if
possible
to
identify
the
person
when
some
one
addressed
him
as
judge
changed
as
the
face
was
i
now
recognized
it
as
that
of
judge
lyman
five
years
had
marred
that
face
terribly
it
seemed
twice
the
former
size
and
all
its
bright
expression
was
gone
the
thickened
and
protruding
eyelids
half
closed
the
leaden
eyes
and
the
swollen
lips
and
cheeks
gave
to
his
countenance
a
look
of
all
predominating
sensuality
true
manliness
had
bowed
itself
in
debasing
submission
to
the
bestial
he
talked
loudly
and
with
a
pompous
dogmatism
mainly
on
political
subjects
but
talked
only
from
memory
for
any
one
could
see
that
thought
came
into
but
feeble
activity
and
yet
derationalized
so
to
speak
as
he
was
through
drink
he
had
been
chosen
a
representative
in
congress
at
the
previous
election
on
the
ticket
and
by
a
very
handsome
majority
he
was
the
rum
candidate
and
the
rum
interest
aided
by
the
easily
swayed
indifferents
swept
aside
the
claims
of
law
order
temperance
and
good
morals
and
the
district
from
which
he
was
chosen
as
a
national
legislator
sent
him
up
to
the
national
councils
and
said
in
the
act
look
upon
him
we
have
chosen
as
our
representative
and
see
in
him
a
type
of
our
principles
our
quality
and
our
condition
as
a
community
judge
lyman
around
whom
a
little
circle
soon
gathered
was
very
severe
on
the
temperance
party
which
for
two
years
had
opposed
his
election
and
which
at
the
last
struggle
showed
itself
to
be
a
rapidly
growing
organization
during
the
canvass
a
paper
was
published
by
this
party
in
which
his
personal
habits
character
and
moral
principles
were
discussed
in
the
freest
manner
and
certainly
not
in
a
way
to
elevate
him
in
the
estimation
of
men
whose
opinion
was
of
any
value
it
was
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
assumed
to
think
temperance
issues
at
the
polls
were
false
issues
and
that
when
temperance
men
sought
to
tamper
with
elections
the
liberties
of
the
people
were
in
danger
nor
that
he
pronounced
the
whole
body
of
temperance
men
as
selfish
schemers
and
canting
hypocrites
the
next
thing
we
will
have
he
exclaimed
warming
with
his
theme
and
speaking
so
loud
that
his
voice
sounded
throughout
the
room
and
arrested
every
one
attention
will
be
laws
to
fine
any
man
who
takes
a
chew
of
tobacco
or
lights
a
cigar
touch
the
liberties
of
the
people
in
the
smallest
particular
and
all
guarantees
are
gone
the
stamp
act
against
which
our
noble
forefathers
rebelled
was
a
light
measure
of
oppression
to
that
contemplated
by
these
worse
than
fanatics
you
are
right
there
judge
right
for
once
in
your
life
if
you
hic
were
never
right
before
exclaimed
a
specimen
of
humanity
who
stood
near
the
speaker
slapping
judge
lyman
on
the
shoulder
familiarly
as
he
spoke
there
no
telling
what
they
will
do
there
hic
my
old
uncle
josh
wilson
who
been
keeper
of
the
these
ten
years
well
they
going
to
turn
him
out
if
ever
they
get
the
upper
hand
in
bolton
county
if
that
word
involves
a
great
deal
harry
said
lyman
we
let
them
get
the
upper
hand
every
man
has
a
duty
to
perform
to
his
country
in
this
matter
and
every
one
must
do
his
duty
but
what
have
they
got
against
your
uncle
joshua
what
has
he
been
doing
to
offend
this
righteous
party
they
nothing
against
him
hic
i
believe
only
they
say
not
going
to
have
a
in
the
county
at
all
what
going
to
turn
the
poor
wretches
out
to
starve
said
one
oh
no
hic
and
the
fellow
grinned
half
shrewdly
and
half
maliciously
as
he
answered
no
not
that
but
when
they
carry
the
day
there
be
no
need
of
at
least
that
their
talk
and
i
guess
maybe
there
something
in
it
for
i
never
knew
a
man
to
go
to
the
who
had
hic
rum
to
blame
for
his
poverty
but
you
see
i
interested
in
this
matter
i
go
for
keeping
up
the
hic
for
i
guess
i
travelling
that
road
and
i
like
to
get
to
the
last
milestone
hic
and
find
no
snug
quarters
no
uncle
josh
you
safe
for
one
vote
any
how
old
chap
on
next
election
day
and
the
man
broad
hand
slapped
the
member
shoulder
again
huzza
for
the
rummies
that
hic
the
ticket
harry
grimes
never
deserts
his
friends
true
as
steel
you
a
trump
returned
judge
lyman
with
low
familiarity
never
fear
about
the
and
uncle
josh
they
all
safe
but
look
here
judge
resumed
the
man
it
is
only
the
the
jail
is
to
go
next
indeed
yes
that
their
talk
and
i
guess
they
ai
far
out
of
the
way
neither
what
takes
men
to
jail
you
can
tell
us
something
about
that
judge
for
you
jugged
a
good
many
in
your
time
did
pretty
much
all
of
drink
rum
hic
but
the
judge
answered
nothing
silence
hic
gives
consent
resumed
grimes
and
they
say
more
once
give
the
upper
hand
and
they
confident
of
beating
us
and
the
courthouse
will
be
to
let
as
for
judges
and
lawyers
they
starve
or
go
into
some
better
business
so
you
see
hic
judge
your
liberties
are
in
danger
but
fight
hard
old
fellow
and
if
you
must
die
hic
die
game
how
well
judge
lyman
relished
this
mode
of
presenting
the
case
was
not
very
apparent
he
was
too
good
a
politician
and
to
show
any
feeling
on
the
subject
and
thus
endanger
a
vote
harry
vote
counted
one
and
a
single
vote
sometimes
gained
or
lost
an
election
one
of
their
gags
he
said
laughing
but
i
too
old
a
stager
not
to
see
the
flimsiness
of
such
pretensions
poverty
and
crime
have
their
origin
in
the
corrupt
heart
and
their
foundations
are
laid
long
and
long
before
the
first
step
is
taken
on
the
road
to
inebriety
it
is
easy
to
promise
results
for
only
the
few
look
at
causes
and
trace
them
to
their
effects
rum
and
ruin
hic
are
they
not
cause
and
effect
asked
grimes
sometimes
they
are
was
the
half
extorted
answer
oh
green
is
that
you
exclaimed
the
judge
as
harvey
green
came
in
with
a
soft
step
he
was
evidently
glad
of
a
chance
to
get
rid
of
his
familiar
friend
and
elector
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
the
man
and
read
his
face
closely
it
was
unchanged
the
same
cold
sinister
eye
the
same
chiselled
mouth
so
firm
now
and
now
yielding
so
elastically
the
same
smile
from
the
teeth
outward
the
same
lines
that
revealed
his
heart
deep
dark
selfishness
if
he
had
indulged
in
drink
during
the
five
intervening
years
it
had
not
corrupted
his
blood
nor
added
thereto
a
single
degree
of
heat
have
you
seen
anything
of
hammond
this
evening
asked
judge
lyman
i
saw
him
an
hour
or
two
ago
answered
green
how
does
he
like
his
new
horse
he
delighted
with
him
what
was
the
price
three
hundred
dollars
indeed
the
judge
had
already
arisen
and
he
and
green
were
now
walking
side
by
side
across
the
floor
i
want
to
speak
a
word
with
you
i
heard
lyman
say
and
then
the
two
went
out
together
i
saw
no
more
of
them
during
the
evening
not
long
afterward
willy
hammond
came
in
ah
there
was
a
sad
change
here
a
change
that
in
no
way
belied
the
words
of
matthew
the
he
went
up
to
the
bar
and
i
heard
him
ask
for
judge
lyman
the
answer
was
in
so
low
a
voice
that
it
did
not
reach
my
ear
with
a
quick
nervous
motion
hammond
threw
his
hand
toward
a
row
of
decanters
on
the
shelf
behind
the
who
immediately
set
one
of
them
containing
brandy
before
him
from
this
he
poured
a
tumbler
half
full
and
drank
it
off
at
a
single
draught
unmixed
with
water
he
then
asked
some
further
question
which
i
could
not
hear
manifesting
as
it
appeared
considerable
excitement
of
mind
in
answering
him
matthew
glanced
his
eyes
upward
as
if
indicating
some
room
in
the
house
the
young
man
then
retired
hurriedly
through
the
what
the
matter
with
willy
hammond
tonight
asked
some
one
of
the
who
he
after
in
such
a
hurry
he
wants
to
see
judge
lyman
replied
matthew
oh
i
guess
they
after
no
good
was
remarked
not
much
i
afraid
two
young
men
well
dressed
and
with
faces
marked
by
intelligence
came
in
at
the
moment
drank
at
the
bar
chatted
a
little
while
familiarly
with
the
and
then
quietly
disappeared
through
the
door
leading
into
the
i
met
the
eyes
of
the
man
with
whom
i
had
talked
during
the
afternoon
and
his
knowing
wink
brought
to
mind
his
suggestion
that
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
gambling
went
on
nightly
and
that
some
of
the
most
promising
young
men
of
the
town
had
been
drawn
through
the
bar
attraction
into
this
vortex
of
ruin
i
felt
a
shudder
creeping
along
my
nerves
the
conversation
that
now
went
on
among
the
company
was
of
such
an
obscene
and
profane
character
that
in
disgust
i
went
out
the
night
was
clear
the
air
soft
and
the
moon
shining
down
brightly
i
walked
for
some
time
in
the
porch
musing
on
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
while
a
constant
stream
of
visitors
came
pouring
into
the
only
a
few
of
these
remained
the
larger
portion
went
in
quickly
took
their
glass
and
then
left
as
if
to
avoid
observation
as
much
as
possible
soon
after
i
commenced
walking
in
the
porch
i
noticed
an
elderly
lady
go
slowly
by
who
in
passing
slightly
paused
and
evidently
tried
to
look
through
the
door
the
pause
was
but
for
an
instant
in
less
than
ten
minutes
she
came
back
again
stopped
this
time
longer
and
again
moved
off
slowly
until
she
passed
out
of
sight
i
was
yet
thinking
about
her
when
on
lifting
my
eyes
from
the
ground
she
was
advancing
along
the
road
but
a
few
rods
distant
i
almost
started
at
seeing
her
for
there
no
longer
remained
a
doubt
on
my
mind
that
she
was
some
trembling
heartsick
woman
in
search
of
an
erring
son
whose
feet
were
in
dangerous
paths
seeing
me
she
kept
on
though
lingeringly
she
went
but
a
short
distance
before
returning
and
this
time
she
moved
in
closer
to
the
house
and
reached
a
position
that
enabled
her
eyes
to
range
through
a
large
portion
of
the
a
nearer
inspection
appeared
to
satisfy
her
she
retired
with
quicker
steps
and
did
not
again
return
during
the
evening
ah
what
a
commentary
upon
the
uses
of
an
attractive
tavern
was
here
my
heart
ached
as
i
thought
of
all
that
unknown
mother
had
suffered
and
was
doomed
to
suffer
i
could
not
shut
out
the
image
of
her
drooping
form
as
i
lay
upon
my
pillow
that
night
she
even
haunted
me
in
my
dreams
night
the
sixth
more
consequences
the
landlord
did
not
make
his
appearance
on
the
next
morning
until
nearly
ten
and
then
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
on
a
debauch
it
was
eleven
before
harvey
green
came
down
nothing
about
him
indicated
the
smallest
deviation
from
the
most
orderly
habit
clean
shaved
with
fresh
linen
and
a
face
every
line
of
which
was
smoothed
into
calmness
he
looked
as
if
he
had
slept
soundly
on
a
quiet
conscience
and
now
hailed
the
new
day
with
a
tranquil
spirit
the
first
act
of
slade
was
to
go
behind
the
bar
and
take
a
stiff
glass
of
brandy
and
water
the
first
act
of
green
to
order
beefsteak
and
coffee
for
his
breakfast
i
noticed
the
meeting
between
the
two
men
on
the
appearance
of
green
there
was
a
slight
reserve
on
the
part
of
green
and
an
uneasy
embarrassment
on
the
part
of
slade
not
even
the
ghost
of
a
smile
was
visible
in
either
countenance
they
spoke
a
few
words
together
and
then
separated
as
if
from
a
sphere
of
mutual
repulsion
i
did
not
observe
them
again
in
company
during
the
day
there
trouble
over
at
the
mill
was
remarked
by
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
some
business
transactions
in
the
afternoon
he
spoke
to
a
person
who
sat
in
his
office
ah
what
the
matter
said
the
other
all
the
hands
were
discharged
at
noon
and
the
mill
shut
down
how
comes
that
they
been
losing
money
from
the
start
rather
bad
practice
i
should
say
it
involves
some
bad
practices
no
doubt
on
willy
part
yes
he
is
reported
to
have
squandered
the
means
placed
in
his
hands
after
a
shameless
fashion
is
the
loss
heavy
so
it
is
said
how
much
reaching
to
thirty
or
forty
thousand
dollars
but
this
is
rumor
and
of
course
an
exaggeration
of
course
no
such
loss
as
that
could
have
been
made
but
what
was
done
with
the
money
how
could
willy
have
spent
it
he
dashes
about
a
great
deal
buys
fast
horses
drinks
rather
freely
and
all
that
but
thirty
or
forty
thousand
dollars
could
escape
in
this
way
at
the
moment
a
swift
trotting
horse
bearing
a
light
sulky
and
a
man
went
by
there
goes
young
hammond
three
hundred
dollar
animal
said
the
last
speaker
it
was
willy
hammond
yesterday
but
there
has
been
a
change
of
ownership
since
then
i
happen
to
know
indeed
yes
the
man
green
who
has
been
loafing
about
cedarville
for
the
last
few
years
after
no
good
i
can
well
believe
came
into
possession
ah
willy
must
be
very
does
the
possession
of
a
coveted
object
so
soon
bring
satiety
there
is
something
not
clearly
understood
about
the
transaction
i
saw
hammond
during
the
forenoon
and
he
looked
terribly
distressed
the
embarrassed
condition
of
things
at
the
mill
readily
accounts
for
this
true
but
i
think
there
are
causes
of
trouble
beyond
the
mere
embarrassments
the
dissolute
spendthrift
habits
of
his
son
was
suggested
these
are
sufficient
to
weigh
down
the
father
spirits
to
bow
him
to
the
very
dust
to
speak
out
plainly
said
the
other
i
am
afraid
that
the
young
man
adds
another
vice
to
that
of
drinking
and
idleness
what
gaining
no
there
is
little
doubt
of
it
in
my
mind
and
it
is
further
my
opinion
that
his
fine
horse
for
which
he
paid
three
hundred
dollars
only
a
few
days
ago
has
passed
into
the
hands
of
this
man
green
in
payment
of
a
debt
contracted
at
the
gaming
table
you
shock
me
surely
there
can
be
no
grounds
for
such
a
belief
i
have
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
gravest
reasons
for
what
i
allege
that
green
is
a
professional
gambler
who
was
attracted
here
by
the
excellent
company
that
assembled
at
the
and
sheaf
in
the
beginning
of
the
lazy
miller
experiment
i
do
not
in
the
least
question
grant
this
and
take
into
account
the
fact
that
young
hammond
has
been
much
in
his
company
and
you
have
sufficient
cause
for
the
most
disastrous
effects
if
this
be
really
so
observed
the
gentleman
over
whose
face
a
shadow
of
concern
darkened
then
willy
hammond
may
not
be
his
only
victim
and
is
not
you
may
rest
assured
if
rumor
be
true
other
of
our
promising
young
men
are
being
drawn
into
the
whirling
circles
that
narrow
toward
a
vortex
of
ruin
in
corroboration
of
this
i
mentioned
the
conversation
i
had
held
with
one
of
the
frequenters
of
slade
bar
room
on
this
very
subject
and
also
what
i
had
myself
observed
on
the
previous
evening
the
man
who
had
until
now
been
sitting
quietly
in
a
chair
started
up
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
merciful
heaven
i
never
dreamed
of
this
whose
sons
are
safe
no
man
was
the
answer
of
the
gentleman
in
whose
office
we
were
sitting
no
man
while
there
are
such
open
doors
to
ruin
as
you
may
find
at
the
and
sheaf
did
not
you
vote
the
ticket
at
the
last
election
i
did
was
the
answer
and
from
principle
on
what
were
your
principles
based
was
inquired
on
the
broad
foundations
of
civil
liberty
the
liberty
to
do
good
or
evil
just
as
the
individual
may
choose
i
would
not
like
to
say
that
there
are
certain
evils
against
which
there
can
be
no
legislation
that
would
not
do
harm
no
civil
power
in
this
country
has
the
right
to
say
what
a
citizen
shall
eat
or
drink
but
may
not
the
people
in
any
community
pass
laws
through
their
delegated
restraining
persons
from
injuring
the
common
good
oh
certainly
certainly
and
are
you
prepared
to
affirm
that
a
where
young
men
are
corrupted
aye
destroyed
body
and
soul
does
not
work
an
injury
to
the
common
good
ah
but
there
must
be
houses
of
public
entertainment
no
one
denies
this
but
can
that
be
a
really
christian
community
which
provides
for
the
moral
debasement
of
strangers
at
the
same
time
that
it
entertains
them
is
it
necessary
that
in
giving
rest
and
entertainment
to
the
traveler
we
also
lead
him
into
temptation
yes
but
but
it
is
going
too
far
to
legislate
on
what
we
are
to
eat
and
drink
it
is
opening
too
wide
a
door
for
fanatical
oppression
we
must
inculcate
temperance
as
a
right
principle
we
must
teach
our
children
the
evils
of
intemperance
and
send
them
out
into
the
world
as
practical
teachers
of
order
virtue
and
sobriety
if
we
do
this
the
reform
becomes
radical
and
in
a
few
years
there
will
be
no
for
none
will
crave
the
fiery
poison
of
little
value
my
friend
will
be
in
far
too
many
cases
your
precepts
if
temptation
invites
our
sons
at
almost
every
step
of
their
way
through
life
thousands
have
fallen
and
thousands
are
now
tottering
soon
to
fall
your
sons
are
not
safe
nor
are
mine
we
can
not
tell
the
day
nor
the
hour
when
they
may
weakly
yield
to
the
solicitation
of
some
companion
and
enter
the
wide
open
door
of
ruin
and
are
we
wise
and
good
citizens
to
commission
men
to
do
the
evil
work
of
enticement
to
encourage
them
to
get
gain
in
corrupting
and
destroying
our
children
to
hesitate
over
some
vague
ideal
of
human
liberty
when
the
sword
is
among
us
slaying
our
best
and
dearest
sir
while
you
hold
back
from
the
work
of
staying
the
flood
that
is
desolating
our
fairest
homes
the
black
waters
are
approaching
your
own
doors
there
was
a
startling
emphasis
in
the
tones
with
which
this
last
sentence
was
uttered
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
the
look
of
anxious
alarm
that
it
called
to
the
face
of
him
whose
fears
it
was
meant
to
excite
what
do
you
mean
sir
was
inquired
simply
that
your
sons
are
in
equal
danger
with
others
and
is
that
all
they
have
been
seen
of
late
in
the
of
the
and
sheaf
who
says
so
twice
within
a
week
i
have
seen
them
going
there
was
answered
good
heavens
no
it
is
true
my
friend
but
who
is
safe
if
we
dig
pits
and
conceal
them
from
view
what
marvel
if
our
own
children
fall
therein
my
sons
going
to
a
tavern
the
man
seemed
utterly
confounded
how
can
i
believe
it
you
must
be
in
error
sir
no
what
i
tell
you
is
the
simple
truth
and
if
they
go
there
the
man
paused
not
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
but
went
hastily
from
the
office
we
are
beginning
to
reap
as
we
have
sown
remarked
the
gentleman
turning
to
me
as
his
agitated
friend
left
the
office
as
i
told
them
in
the
commencement
it
would
be
so
it
is
happening
the
want
of
a
good
tavern
in
cedarville
was
over
and
over
again
alleged
as
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
our
want
of
thrift
and
when
slade
opened
the
and
sheaf
the
man
was
almost
glorified
the
gentleman
who
has
just
left
us
failed
not
in
laudation
of
the
enterprising
landlord
the
more
particularly
as
the
building
of
the
new
tavern
advanced
the
price
of
ground
on
the
street
and
made
him
a
few
hundred
dollars
richer
really
for
a
time
one
might
have
thought
from
the
way
people
went
on
that
simon
slade
was
going
to
make
every
man
fortune
in
cedarville
but
all
that
has
been
gained
by
a
small
advance
in
property
is
as
a
grain
of
sand
to
a
mountain
compared
with
the
fearful
demoralization
that
has
followed
i
readily
assented
to
this
for
i
had
myself
seen
enough
to
justify
the
conclusion
as
i
sat
in
the
of
the
sickle
and
sheaf
that
evening
i
noticed
soon
after
the
lamps
were
lighted
the
gentleman
referred
to
in
the
above
conversation
whose
sons
were
represented
as
visitors
to
the
bar
come
in
quietly
and
look
anxiously
about
the
room
he
spoke
to
no
one
and
after
satisfying
himself
that
those
he
sought
were
not
there
went
out
what
sent
him
here
i
wonder
muttered
slade
speaking
partly
to
himself
and
partly
aside
to
matthew
the
after
the
boys
i
suppose
was
answered
i
guess
the
boys
are
old
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
they
ought
to
be
returned
matthew
and
are
said
slade
have
they
been
here
this
evening
no
not
yet
while
they
yet
talked
together
two
young
men
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
night
before
and
noticed
particularly
as
showing
signs
of
intelligence
and
respectability
beyond
the
ordinary
visitors
at
a
came
in
john
i
heard
slade
say
in
a
low
confidential
voice
to
one
of
them
your
old
man
was
here
just
now
no
the
young
man
looked
startled
almost
confounded
it
a
fact
so
you
better
keep
shady
what
did
he
want
i
do
know
what
did
he
say
nothing
he
just
came
in
looked
around
and
then
went
out
his
face
was
as
dark
as
a
remarked
matthew
is
no
vacant
inquired
one
of
the
young
men
yes
send
us
up
a
bottle
of
wine
and
some
cigars
and
when
bill
harding
and
harry
lee
come
in
tell
them
where
they
can
find
us
all
right
said
matthew
and
now
take
a
friend
advice
and
make
yourselves
scarce
the
young
men
left
the
room
hastily
scarcely
had
they
departed
ere
i
saw
the
same
gentleman
come
in
whose
anxious
face
had
a
little
while
before
thrown
its
shadow
over
the
apartment
he
was
the
father
in
search
of
his
sons
again
he
glanced
around
nervously
and
this
time
appeared
to
be
disappointed
as
he
entered
slade
went
out
have
john
and
wilson
been
here
this
evening
he
asked
coming
up
to
the
bar
and
addressing
matthew
they
are
not
here
replied
matthew
evasively
but
have
they
been
here
they
may
have
been
here
i
only
came
in
from
my
supper
a
little
while
ago
i
thought
i
saw
them
entering
only
a
moment
or
two
ago
they
not
here
sir
matthew
shook
his
head
and
spoke
firmly
where
is
mr
slade
in
the
house
somewhere
i
wish
you
would
ask
him
to
step
here
matthew
went
out
but
in
a
little
while
came
back
with
word
that
the
landlord
was
not
to
be
found
you
are
sure
the
boys
are
not
here
said
the
man
with
a
doubting
dissatisfied
manner
see
for
yourself
mr
harrison
perhaps
they
are
in
the
parlor
step
in
sir
coolly
returned
matthew
the
man
went
through
the
door
into
the
but
came
back
immediately
not
there
said
matthew
the
man
shook
his
head
i
do
think
you
find
them
about
here
added
the
harrison
this
was
the
name
by
which
matthew
addressed
him
stood
musing
and
irresolute
for
some
minutes
he
could
not
be
mistaken
about
the
entrance
of
his
sons
and
yet
they
were
not
there
his
manner
was
much
perplexed
at
length
he
took
a
seat
in
a
far
corner
of
the
somewhat
beyond
the
line
of
observation
evidently
with
the
purpose
of
waiting
to
see
if
those
he
sought
would
come
in
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
two
young
men
entered
whose
appearance
at
once
excited
his
interest
they
went
up
to
the
bar
and
called
for
liquor
as
matthew
set
the
decanter
before
them
he
leaned
over
the
counter
and
said
something
in
a
whisper
where
was
instantly
ejaculated
in
surprise
and
both
of
the
young
men
glanced
uneasily
about
the
room
they
met
the
eyes
of
harrison
fixed
intently
upon
them
i
do
not
think
from
the
way
they
swallowed
their
brandy
and
water
that
it
was
enjoyed
very
much
what
the
deuce
is
he
doing
here
i
heard
one
of
them
say
in
a
low
voice
after
the
boys
of
course
have
they
come
yet
matthew
winked
as
he
answered
all
safe
in
no
yes
and
the
wine
and
cigars
all
waiting
for
you
good
you
better
not
go
through
the
parlor
their
old
man
not
at
all
satisfied
he
half
suspects
they
in
the
house
better
go
off
down
the
street
and
come
back
and
enter
through
the
passage
the
young
men
acting
on
this
hint
at
once
retired
the
eyes
of
harrison
following
them
out
for
nearly
an
hour
harrison
kept
his
position
a
close
observer
of
all
that
transpired
i
am
very
much
in
error
if
before
leaving
that
sink
of
iniquity
he
was
not
fully
satisfied
as
to
the
propriety
of
legislating
on
the
liquor
question
nay
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
if
the
power
of
suppression
had
rested
in
his
hands
there
would
not
have
been
in
the
whole
state
at
the
expiration
of
an
hour
a
single
establishment
the
goring
of
his
ox
had
opened
his
eyes
to
the
true
merits
of
the
question
while
he
was
yet
in
the
young
hammond
made
his
appearance
his
look
was
wild
and
excited
first
he
called
for
brandy
and
drank
with
the
eagerness
of
a
man
long
athirst
where
is
green
i
heard
him
inquire
as
he
set
his
glass
upon
the
counter
have
seen
anything
of
him
since
supper
was
answered
by
matthew
is
he
in
his
room
i
think
it
probable
has
judge
lyman
been
about
here
tonight
yes
he
spouted
here
for
half
an
hour
against
the
temperance
party
as
usual
and
then
matthew
tossed
his
head
toward
the
door
leading
to
the
hammond
was
moving
toward
this
door
when
in
glancing
around
the
room
he
encountered
the
fixed
gaze
of
harrison
a
gaze
that
instantly
checked
his
progress
returning
to
the
bar
and
leaning
over
the
counter
he
said
to
matthew
what
has
sent
him
here
matthew
winked
knowingly
after
the
boys
inquired
hammond
yes
where
are
they
does
he
suspect
this
i
ca
tell
if
he
does
think
them
here
now
he
is
looking
for
them
to
come
in
do
they
know
he
is
after
them
oh
yes
all
safe
then
as
an
iron
chest
if
you
want
to
see
them
just
rap
at
no
hammond
stood
for
some
minutes
leaning
on
the
bar
and
then
not
once
again
looking
toward
that
part
of
the
room
where
harrison
was
seated
passed
out
through
the
door
leading
to
the
street
soon
afterward
harrison
departed
disgusted
as
on
the
night
before
with
the
unceasing
flow
of
vile
obscene
and
profane
language
i
left
my
place
of
observation
in
the
and
sought
the
open
air
the
sky
was
unobscured
by
a
single
cloud
and
the
moon
almost
at
the
full
shone
abroad
with
more
than
common
brightness
i
had
not
been
sitting
long
in
the
porch
when
the
same
lady
whose
movements
had
attracted
my
attention
came
in
sight
walking
very
slowly
the
deliberate
pace
assumed
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
better
observation
on
coming
opposite
the
tavern
she
slightly
paused
as
on
the
evening
before
and
then
kept
on
passing
down
the
street
until
she
was
beyond
observation
poor
mother
i
was
still
repeating
to
myself
when
her
form
again
met
my
eyes
slowly
she
advanced
and
now
came
in
nearer
to
the
house
the
interest
excited
in
my
mind
was
so
strong
that
i
could
not
repress
the
desire
i
felt
to
address
her
and
so
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
the
porch
she
seemed
startled
and
retreated
backward
several
paces
are
you
in
search
of
any
one
i
inquired
respectfully
the
woman
now
stood
in
a
position
that
let
the
moon
shine
full
upon
her
face
revealing
every
feature
she
was
far
past
the
meridian
of
life
and
there
were
lines
of
suffering
and
sorrow
on
her
fine
countenance
i
saw
that
her
lips
moved
but
it
was
some
time
before
i
distinguished
the
words
have
you
seen
my
son
they
say
he
comes
here
the
manner
in
which
this
was
said
caused
a
cold
thrill
to
run
over
me
i
perceived
that
the
woman
mind
wandered
i
answered
no
i
have
seen
any
thing
of
him
my
tone
of
voice
seemed
to
inspire
her
with
confidence
for
she
came
up
close
to
me
and
bent
her
face
toward
mine
it
is
a
dreadful
place
she
whispered
huskily
and
they
say
he
comes
here
poor
boy
he
is
what
he
used
to
be
it
is
a
very
bad
place
said
i
come
and
i
moved
a
step
or
two
in
the
direction
from
which
i
had
seen
her
approaching
come
better
go
away
as
quickly
as
possible
but
if
he
here
she
answered
not
moving
from
where
she
stood
i
might
save
him
you
know
i
am
sure
you
wo
find
him
i
urged
perhaps
he
is
home
now
oh
no
no
and
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
he
never
comes
home
until
long
after
midnight
i
wish
i
could
see
inside
of
the
i
sure
he
must
be
there
if
you
will
tell
me
his
name
i
will
go
in
and
search
for
him
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
she
answered
his
name
is
willy
hammond
how
the
name
uttered
so
sadly
and
yet
with
such
moving
tenderness
by
the
mother
lips
caused
me
to
start
almost
to
tremble
if
he
is
in
the
house
said
i
firmly
i
will
see
him
for
you
and
i
left
her
and
went
into
the
bar
in
what
room
do
you
think
i
will
find
young
hammond
i
asked
of
the
he
looked
at
me
curiously
but
did
not
answer
the
question
had
come
upon
him
unanticipated
in
harvey
green
room
i
pursued
i
do
know
i
am
sure
he
is
in
the
house
to
my
knowledge
i
saw
him
go
out
about
half
an
hour
since
green
room
is
eleven
he
answered
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
yes
i
asked
no
further
question
but
went
to
no
and
tapped
on
the
door
but
no
one
answered
the
summons
i
listened
but
could
not
distinguish
the
slightest
sound
within
again
i
knocked
but
louder
if
my
ears
did
not
deceive
me
the
chink
of
coin
was
heard
still
there
was
neither
voice
nor
movement
i
was
disappointed
that
the
room
had
inmates
i
felt
sure
remembering
now
what
i
had
heard
about
light
being
seen
in
this
room
through
a
rent
in
the
curtain
i
went
and
out
into
the
street
a
short
distance
beyond
the
house
i
saw
dimly
the
form
she
had
only
just
passed
in
her
movement
to
and
fro
glancing
up
at
the
window
which
i
now
knew
to
be
the
one
in
green
room
light
through
the
torn
curtain
was
plainly
visible
back
into
the
house
i
went
and
up
to
no
this
time
i
knocked
imperatively
and
this
time
made
myself
heard
what
wanted
came
from
within
i
knew
the
voice
to
be
that
of
harvey
green
i
only
knocked
louder
a
hurried
movement
and
the
low
murmur
of
voices
was
heard
for
some
moments
then
the
door
was
unlocked
and
held
partly
open
by
green
whose
body
so
filled
the
narrow
aperture
that
i
could
not
look
into
the
room
seeing
me
a
dark
scowl
fell
upon
his
countenance
what
d
want
he
inquired
sharply
is
hammond
here
if
so
he
is
wanted
downstairs
no
he
not
was
the
quick
answer
what
sent
you
here
for
him
hey
the
fact
that
i
expected
to
find
him
in
your
room
was
my
firm
answer
green
was
about
shutting
the
door
in
my
face
when
some
one
placed
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
something
to
him
that
i
could
not
hear
who
wants
to
see
him
he
inquired
of
me
satisfied
now
that
hammond
was
in
the
room
i
said
slightly
elevating
my
voice
his
mother
the
words
were
an
open
sesame
to
the
room
the
door
was
suddenly
jerked
open
and
with
a
blanching
face
the
young
man
confronted
me
who
says
my
mother
is
he
demanded
i
come
from
her
in
search
of
you
i
said
you
will
find
her
in
the
road
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
tavern
almost
with
a
bound
he
swept
by
me
and
descended
the
stairway
at
two
or
three
long
strides
as
the
door
swung
open
i
saw
besides
green
and
hammond
the
landlord
and
judge
lyman
it
needed
not
the
loose
cards
on
the
table
near
which
the
latter
were
sitting
to
tell
me
of
their
business
in
that
room
as
quickly
as
seemed
decorous
i
followed
hammond
on
the
porch
i
met
him
coming
in
from
the
road
you
have
deceived
me
sir
said
he
sternly
almost
menacingly
no
sir
i
replied
what
i
told
you
was
but
too
true
look
there
she
is
now
the
young
man
sprung
around
and
stood
before
the
woman
a
few
paces
distant
mother
oh
mother
what
has
brought
you
here
he
exclaimed
in
an
under
tone
as
he
caught
her
arm
and
moved
away
he
spoke
not
roughly
nor
angrily
but
with
respect
half
reproachfulness
and
an
unmistakable
tenderness
oh
willy
willy
i
heard
her
answer
somebody
said
you
came
here
at
night
and
i
could
rest
oh
dear
they
murder
you
i
know
they
will
do
oh
my
ears
took
in
the
sense
no
further
though
her
pleading
voice
still
reached
my
ears
a
few
moments
and
they
were
out
of
sight
nearly
two
hours
afterward
as
i
was
ascending
to
my
chamber
a
man
brushed
quickly
by
me
i
glanced
after
him
and
recognized
the
person
of
young
hammond
he
was
going
to
the
room
of
harvey
green
night
the
seventh
sowing
the
wind
the
state
of
affairs
in
cedarville
it
was
plain
from
the
partial
glimpses
i
had
received
was
rather
desperate
desperate
i
mean
as
regarded
the
various
parties
brought
before
my
observation
an
eating
cancer
was
on
the
community
and
so
far
as
the
eye
could
mark
its
destructive
progress
the
ravages
were
tearful
that
its
roots
were
striking
deep
and
penetrating
concealed
from
view
in
many
unsuspected
directions
there
could
be
no
doubt
what
appeared
on
the
surface
was
but
a
milder
form
of
the
disease
compared
with
its
hidden
more
vital
and
more
dangerous
advances
i
could
not
but
feel
a
strong
interest
in
some
of
these
parties
the
case
of
young
hammond
had
from
the
first
awakened
concern
and
now
a
new
element
was
added
in
the
appearance
of
his
mother
on
the
stage
in
a
state
that
seemed
one
of
partial
derangement
the
gentleman
at
whose
office
i
met
harrison
on
the
day
before
the
reader
will
remember
as
having
come
to
the
sickle
and
sheath
in
search
of
his
son
was
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
affairs
of
the
village
and
i
called
upon
him
early
in
the
day
in
order
to
make
some
inquiries
about
hammond
my
first
question
as
to
whether
he
knew
the
lady
was
answered
by
the
remark
oh
yes
she
is
one
of
my
earliest
friends
the
allusion
to
her
did
not
seem
to
awaken
agreeable
states
of
mind
a
slight
shade
obscured
his
face
and
i
noticed
that
he
sighed
involuntarily
is
willy
her
only
child
her
only
living
child
she
had
four
another
son
and
two
daughters
but
she
lost
all
but
willy
when
they
were
quite
young
and
he
added
after
a
pause
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
and
for
willy
too
if
he
had
gone
to
a
better
land
with
them
his
course
of
life
must
be
to
her
a
terrible
affliction
said
i
it
is
destroying
her
reason
he
replied
with
emphasis
he
was
her
idol
no
mother
ever
loved
a
son
with
more
than
hammond
loved
her
beautiful
intelligent
affectionate
boy
to
say
that
she
was
proud
of
him
is
but
a
tame
expression
intense
love
almost
idolatry
was
the
strong
passion
of
her
heart
how
tender
how
watchful
was
her
love
except
when
at
school
he
was
scarcely
ever
separated
from
her
in
order
to
keep
him
by
her
side
she
gave
up
her
thoughts
to
the
suggestion
and
maturing
of
plans
for
keeping
his
mind
active
and
interested
in
her
society
and
her
success
was
perfect
up
to
the
age
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
i
do
not
think
he
had
a
desire
for
other
companionship
than
that
of
his
mother
but
this
you
know
could
not
last
the
boy
maturing
thought
must
go
beyond
the
home
and
social
circle
the
great
world
that
he
was
soon
to
enter
was
before
him
and
through
loopholes
that
opened
here
and
there
he
obtained
partial
glimpses
of
what
was
beyond
to
step
forth
into
this
world
where
he
was
soon
to
be
a
busy
actor
and
worker
and
to
step
forth
alone
next
came
in
the
natural
order
of
progress
how
his
mother
trembled
with
anxiety
as
she
saw
him
leave
her
side
of
the
dangers
that
would
surround
his
path
she
knew
too
well
and
these
were
magnified
by
her
fears
at
least
so
i
often
said
to
her
alas
how
far
the
sad
reality
has
outrun
her
most
fearful
anticipations
when
willy
was
eighteen
he
was
then
reading
law
i
think
i
never
saw
a
young
man
of
fairer
promise
as
i
have
often
heard
it
remarked
of
him
he
did
not
appear
to
have
a
single
fault
but
he
had
a
dangerous
gift
rare
conversational
powers
united
with
great
urbanity
of
manner
every
one
who
made
his
acquaintance
became
charmed
with
his
society
and
he
soon
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
young
men
some
of
whom
were
not
the
best
companions
he
might
have
chosen
still
his
own
pure
instincts
and
honorable
principles
were
his
safeguard
and
i
never
have
believed
that
any
social
allurements
would
have
drawn
him
away
from
the
right
path
if
this
accursed
tavern
had
not
been
opened
by
slade
there
was
a
tavern
here
before
the
and
sheaf
was
opened
said
i
oh
yes
but
it
was
badly
kept
and
the
visitors
were
of
the
lowest
class
no
respectable
young
man
in
cedarville
would
have
been
seen
there
it
offered
no
temptations
to
one
moving
in
willy
circle
but
the
opening
of
the
and
sheaf
formed
a
new
era
judge
hammond
himself
not
the
purest
man
in
the
world
i
afraid
gave
his
countenance
to
the
establishment
and
talked
of
simon
slade
as
an
enterprising
man
who
ought
to
be
encouraged
judge
lyman
and
other
men
of
position
in
cedarville
followed
his
bad
example
and
the
of
the
and
sheaf
was
at
once
voted
respectable
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
evening
you
could
see
the
flower
of
our
young
men
going
in
and
out
sitting
in
front
of
the
or
talking
with
the
landlord
who
from
a
worthy
miller
regarded
as
well
enough
in
his
place
was
suddenly
elevated
into
a
man
of
importance
whom
the
best
in
the
village
were
delighted
to
honor
in
the
beginning
willy
went
with
the
tide
and
in
an
incredibly
short
period
was
acquiring
a
fondness
for
drink
that
startled
and
alarmed
his
friends
in
going
in
through
slade
open
door
he
entered
the
downward
way
and
has
been
moving
onward
with
fleet
footsteps
ever
since
the
fiery
poison
inflamed
his
mind
at
the
same
time
that
it
dimmed
his
noble
perceptions
fondness
for
mere
pleasure
followed
and
this
led
him
into
various
sensual
indulgences
and
exciting
modes
of
passing
the
time
every
one
liked
him
he
was
so
free
so
companionable
and
so
generous
and
almost
every
one
encouraged
rather
than
repressed
his
dangerous
proclivities
even
his
father
for
a
time
treated
the
matter
lightly
as
only
the
first
flush
of
young
life
commenced
sowing
my
wild
oats
at
quite
as
early
an
age
i
have
heard
him
say
cool
off
and
do
well
enough
never
fear
but
his
mother
was
in
a
state
of
painful
alarm
from
the
beginning
her
truer
instincts
made
doubly
acute
by
her
yearning
love
perceived
the
imminent
danger
and
in
all
possible
ways
did
she
seek
to
lure
him
from
the
path
in
which
he
was
moving
at
so
rapid
a
pace
willy
was
always
very
much
attached
to
his
mother
and
her
influence
over
him
was
strong
but
in
this
case
he
regarded
her
fears
as
chimerical
the
way
in
which
he
walked
was
to
him
so
pleasant
and
the
companions
of
his
journey
so
delightful
that
he
could
not
believe
in
the
prophesied
evil
and
when
his
mother
talked
to
him
in
her
warning
voice
and
with
a
sad
countenance
he
smiled
at
her
concern
and
made
light
of
her
fears
and
so
it
went
on
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
until
the
young
man
sad
declensions
were
the
town
talk
in
order
to
throw
his
mind
into
a
new
channel
to
awaken
if
possible
a
new
and
better
interest
in
life
his
father
ventured
upon
the
doubtful
experiment
we
spoke
of
yesterday
that
of
placing
capital
in
his
hands
and
making
him
an
equal
partner
in
the
business
of
distilling
and
the
disastrous
i
might
say
disgraceful
result
you
know
the
young
man
squandered
his
own
capital
and
heavily
embarrassed
his
father
the
effect
of
all
this
upon
hammond
has
been
painful
in
the
extreme
we
can
only
dimly
imagine
the
terrible
suffering
through
which
she
has
passed
her
present
aberration
was
first
visible
after
a
long
period
of
sleeplessness
occasioned
by
distress
of
mind
during
the
whole
of
two
weeks
i
am
told
she
did
not
close
her
eyes
the
most
of
that
time
walking
the
floor
of
her
chamber
and
weeping
powerful
anodynes
frequently
repeated
at
length
brought
relief
but
when
she
awoke
from
a
prolonged
period
of
unconsciousness
the
brightness
of
her
reason
was
gone
since
then
she
has
never
been
clearly
conscious
of
what
was
passing
around
her
and
well
for
her
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
was
for
even
obscurity
of
intellect
is
a
blessing
in
her
case
ah
me
i
always
get
the
when
i
think
of
her
did
not
this
event
startle
the
young
man
from
his
fatal
dream
if
i
may
so
call
his
mad
infatuation
i
asked
no
he
loved
his
mother
and
was
deeply
afflicted
by
the
calamity
but
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
stop
some
terrible
necessity
appeared
to
be
impelling
him
onward
if
he
formed
good
resolutions
and
i
doubt
not
that
he
did
they
were
blown
away
like
threads
of
gossamer
the
moment
he
came
within
the
sphere
of
old
associations
his
way
to
the
mill
was
by
the
and
sheaf
and
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
pass
there
without
being
drawn
into
the
bar
either
by
his
own
desire
for
drink
or
through
the
invitation
of
some
pleasant
companion
who
was
lounging
in
front
of
the
tavern
there
may
have
been
something
even
more
impelling
than
his
love
of
drink
said
i
what
i
related
briefly
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
night
i
feared
nay
i
was
certain
that
he
was
in
the
toils
of
this
man
and
yet
your
confirmation
of
the
fact
startles
and
confounds
me
said
he
moving
about
his
office
in
a
disturbed
manner
if
my
mind
has
questioned
and
doubted
in
regard
to
young
hammond
it
questions
and
doubts
no
longer
the
word
is
not
now
written
over
the
door
of
his
habitation
great
father
and
is
it
thus
that
our
young
men
are
led
into
temptation
thus
that
their
ruin
is
premeditated
secured
thus
that
the
fowler
is
permitted
to
spread
his
net
in
the
open
day
and
the
destroyer
licensed
to
work
ruin
in
darkness
it
is
awful
to
contemplate
the
man
was
strongly
excited
thus
it
is
he
continued
and
we
who
see
the
whole
extent
origin
and
downward
rushing
force
of
a
widely
sweeping
desolation
lift
our
voices
of
warning
almost
in
vain
men
who
have
everything
at
stake
sons
to
be
corrupted
and
daughters
to
become
the
wives
of
young
men
exposed
to
corrupting
influences
stand
aloof
questioning
and
doubting
as
to
the
expediency
of
protecting
the
innocent
from
the
wolfish
designs
of
bad
men
who
to
compass
their
own
selfish
ends
would
destroy
them
body
and
soul
we
are
called
fanatics
ultraists
designing
and
all
that
because
we
ask
our
to
stay
the
fiery
ruin
oh
no
we
must
not
touch
the
traffic
all
the
dearest
and
best
interests
of
society
may
suffer
but
the
must
be
protected
he
must
be
allowed
to
get
gain
if
the
jails
and
poorhouses
are
filled
and
the
graveyards
made
fat
with
the
bodies
of
young
men
stricken
down
in
the
flower
of
their
years
and
of
wives
and
mothers
who
have
died
of
broken
hearts
reform
we
are
told
must
commence
at
home
we
must
rear
temperate
children
and
then
we
shall
have
temperate
men
that
when
there
are
none
to
desire
liquor
the
traffic
will
cease
and
all
the
while
society
true
benefactors
are
engaged
in
doing
this
the
weak
the
unsuspecting
and
the
erring
must
be
left
an
easy
prey
even
if
the
work
requires
for
its
accomplishment
a
hundred
years
sir
a
human
soul
destroyed
through
the
infernal
agency
is
a
sacrifice
priceless
in
value
no
considerations
of
worldly
gain
can
for
an
instant
be
placed
in
comparison
therewith
and
yet
souls
are
destroyed
by
thousands
every
year
and
they
will
fall
by
tens
of
thousands
ere
society
awakens
from
its
fatal
indifference
and
lays
its
strong
hand
of
power
on
the
corrupt
men
who
are
scattering
disease
ruin
and
death
broadcast
over
the
land
i
always
get
warm
on
this
subject
he
added
repressing
his
enthusiasm
and
who
that
observes
and
reflects
can
help
growing
excited
the
evil
is
appalling
and
the
indifference
of
the
community
one
of
the
strangest
facts
of
the
day
while
he
was
yet
speaking
the
elder
hammond
came
in
he
looked
wretched
the
redness
and
humidity
of
his
eyes
showed
want
of
sleep
and
the
relaxed
muscles
of
his
face
exhaustion
from
weariness
and
suffering
he
drew
the
person
with
whom
i
had
been
talking
aside
and
continued
an
earnest
conversation
with
him
for
many
minutes
often
gesticulating
violently
i
could
see
his
face
though
i
heard
nothing
of
what
he
said
the
play
of
his
features
was
painful
to
look
upon
for
every
changing
muscle
showed
a
new
phase
of
mental
suffering
try
and
see
him
will
you
not
he
said
as
he
turned
at
length
to
leave
the
office
i
will
go
there
immediately
was
answered
bring
him
home
if
possible
my
very
best
efforts
shall
be
made
judge
hammond
bowed
and
went
out
hurriedly
do
you
know
the
number
of
the
room
occupied
by
the
man
green
asked
the
gentleman
as
soon
as
his
visitor
had
retired
yes
it
is
no
willy
has
not
been
home
since
last
night
his
father
at
this
late
day
suspects
green
to
be
a
gambler
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
only
yesterday
and
this
added
to
his
other
sources
of
trouble
is
driving
him
so
he
says
almost
mad
as
a
friend
he
wishes
me
to
go
to
the
and
sheaf
and
try
and
find
willy
have
you
seen
any
thing
of
him
this
morning
i
answered
in
the
negative
nor
of
green
no
was
slade
about
when
you
left
the
tavern
i
saw
nothing
of
him
what
judge
hammond
fears
may
be
all
too
true
that
in
the
present
condition
of
willy
affairs
which
have
reached
the
point
of
disaster
his
tempter
means
to
secure
the
largest
possible
share
of
property
yet
in
his
power
to
pledge
or
transfer
to
squeeze
from
his
victim
the
last
drop
of
blood
that
remains
and
then
fling
him
ruthlessly
from
his
hands
the
young
man
must
have
been
rendered
almost
desperate
or
he
would
never
have
returned
as
he
did
last
night
did
you
mention
this
to
his
father
no
it
would
have
distressed
him
the
more
without
effecting
any
good
he
is
wretched
enough
but
time
passes
and
none
is
to
be
lost
now
will
you
go
with
me
i
walked
to
the
tavern
with
him
and
we
went
into
the
bar
together
two
or
three
men
were
at
the
counter
drinking
is
green
about
this
morning
was
asked
by
the
person
who
had
come
in
search
of
young
hammond
have
seen
any
thing
of
him
is
he
in
his
room
i
do
know
will
you
ascertain
for
me
certainly
frank
and
he
spoke
to
the
landlord
son
who
was
lounging
on
a
settee
i
wish
you
would
see
if
green
is
in
his
room
go
and
see
yourself
i
not
your
waiter
was
growled
back
in
an
voice
in
a
moment
i
ascertain
for
you
said
matthew
politely
after
waiting
on
some
new
customers
who
were
just
entering
matthew
went
to
obtain
the
desired
information
as
he
left
the
frank
got
up
and
went
behind
the
counter
where
he
mixed
himself
a
glass
of
liquor
and
drank
it
off
evidently
with
real
enjoyment
rather
a
dangerous
business
for
one
so
young
as
you
are
remarked
the
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
come
as
frank
stepped
out
of
the
bar
and
passed
near
where
we
were
standing
the
only
answer
to
this
was
an
frown
and
an
expression
of
face
which
said
almost
as
plainly
as
words
it
is
none
of
your
business
not
there
said
matthew
now
coming
in
are
you
certain
yes
sir
but
there
was
a
certain
involuntary
hesitation
in
the
manner
which
led
to
a
suspicion
that
his
answer
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
truth
we
walked
out
together
conferring
on
the
subject
and
both
concluded
that
his
word
was
not
to
be
relied
upon
what
is
to
be
done
was
asked
go
to
green
room
i
replied
and
knock
at
the
door
if
he
is
there
he
may
answer
not
suspecting
your
errand
show
me
the
room
i
went
up
with
him
and
pointed
out
no
he
knocked
lightly
but
there
came
no
sound
from
within
he
repeated
the
knock
all
was
silent
again
and
again
he
knocked
but
there
came
back
only
a
hollow
reverberation
there
no
one
there
said
he
returning
to
where
i
stood
and
we
walked
together
on
the
landing
as
we
reached
the
lower
passage
we
met
slade
i
had
not
during
this
visit
at
cedarville
stood
face
to
face
with
her
before
oh
what
a
wreck
she
presented
with
her
pale
shrunken
countenance
hollow
lustreless
eyes
and
bent
feeble
body
i
almost
shuddered
as
i
looked
at
her
what
a
haunting
and
sternly
rebuking
spectre
she
must
have
moved
daily
before
the
eyes
of
her
husband
have
you
noticed
green
about
this
morning
i
asked
he
has
come
down
from
his
room
yet
she
replied
are
you
certain
said
my
companion
i
knocked
several
times
at
the
door
just
now
but
received
no
answer
what
do
you
want
with
him
asked
slade
fixing
her
eyes
upon
us
we
are
in
search
of
willy
hammond
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
he
was
with
green
knock
twice
lightly
and
then
three
times
more
firmly
said
slade
and
as
she
spoke
she
glided
past
us
with
noiseless
tread
shall
we
go
up
together
i
did
not
object
for
although
i
had
no
delegated
right
of
intrusion
my
feelings
were
so
much
excited
in
the
case
that
i
went
forward
scarcely
reflecting
on
the
propriety
of
so
doing
the
signal
knock
found
instant
answer
the
door
was
softly
opened
and
the
unshaven
face
of
simon
slade
presented
itself
mr
jacobs
he
said
with
surprise
in
his
tones
do
you
wish
to
see
me
no
sir
i
wish
to
see
green
and
with
a
quick
firm
pressure
against
the
door
he
pushed
it
wide
open
the
same
party
was
there
that
i
had
seen
on
the
night
before
green
young
hammond
judge
lyman
and
slade
on
the
table
at
which
the
three
former
were
sitting
were
cards
slips
of
paper
an
and
pens
and
a
pile
of
on
a
or
rather
butler
tray
were
bottles
decanters
and
glasses
judge
lyman
is
it
possible
exclaimed
jacobs
the
name
of
my
companion
i
did
not
expect
to
find
you
here
green
instantly
swept
his
hands
over
the
table
to
secure
the
money
and
bills
it
contained
but
ere
he
had
accomplished
his
purpose
young
hammond
grappled
three
or
four
narrow
strips
of
paper
and
hastily
tore
them
into
shreds
you
a
cheating
scoundrel
cried
green
fiercely
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
bosom
as
if
to
draw
from
thence
a
weapon
but
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
ere
hammond
sprung
upon
him
with
the
fierceness
of
a
tiger
bearing
him
down
upon
the
floor
both
hands
were
already
about
the
gambler
neck
and
ere
the
bewildered
spectators
could
interfere
and
drag
him
off
green
was
purple
in
the
face
and
nearly
strangled
call
me
a
cheating
scoundrel
said
hammond
foaming
at
the
mouth
as
he
spoke
me
whom
you
have
followed
like
a
thirsty
me
whom
you
have
robbed
and
cheated
and
debased
from
the
beginning
oh
for
a
pistol
to
rid
the
earth
of
the
villain
that
walks
its
surface
let
me
go
gentlemen
i
have
nothing
left
in
the
world
to
care
for
there
is
no
consequence
i
fear
let
me
do
society
one
good
service
before
i
die
and
with
one
vigorous
effort
he
swept
himself
clear
of
the
hands
that
were
pinioning
him
and
sprung
again
upon
the
gambler
with
the
fierce
energy
of
a
savage
beast
by
this
time
green
had
got
his
knife
free
from
its
sheath
and
as
hammond
was
closing
upon
him
in
his
blind
rage
plunged
it
into
his
side
quick
almost
as
lightning
the
knife
was
withdrawn
and
two
more
stabs
inflicted
ere
we
could
seize
and
disarm
the
murderer
as
we
did
so
willy
hammond
fell
over
with
a
deep
groan
the
blood
flowing
from
his
side
in
the
terror
and
excitement
that
followed
green
rushed
from
the
room
the
doctor
who
was
instantly
summoned
after
carefully
examining
the
wound
and
the
condition
of
the
unhappy
young
man
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
he
was
fatally
injured
oh
the
anguish
of
the
father
who
had
quickly
heard
of
the
dreadful
occurrence
when
this
announcement
was
made
i
never
saw
such
fearful
agony
in
any
human
countenance
the
calmest
of
all
the
anxious
group
was
willy
himself
on
his
father
face
his
eyes
were
fixed
as
if
by
a
kind
of
fascination
are
you
in
much
pain
my
poor
boy
sobbed
the
old
man
stooping
over
him
until
his
long
white
hair
mingled
with
the
damp
locks
of
the
sufferer
not
much
father
was
the
whispered
reply
do
speak
of
this
to
mother
yet
i
afraid
it
will
kill
her
what
could
the
father
answer
nothing
and
he
was
silent
does
she
know
of
it
a
shadow
went
over
his
face
hammond
shook
his
head
yet
even
as
he
spoke
a
wild
cry
of
distress
was
heard
below
some
indiscreet
person
had
borne
to
the
ears
of
the
mother
the
fearful
news
about
her
son
and
she
had
come
wildly
flying
toward
the
tavern
and
was
just
entering
it
is
my
poor
mother
said
willy
a
flush
coming
into
his
pale
face
who
could
have
told
her
of
this
hammond
started
for
the
door
but
ere
he
had
reached
it
the
distracted
mother
entered
oh
willy
my
boy
my
boy
she
exclaimed
in
tones
of
anguish
that
made
the
heart
shudder
and
she
crouched
down
on
the
floor
the
moment
she
reached
the
bed
whereon
he
lay
and
pressed
her
lips
oh
so
tenderly
and
lovingly
to
his
dear
mother
sweet
mother
best
of
mothers
he
even
smiled
as
he
said
this
and
into
the
face
now
bent
over
him
looked
up
with
glances
of
unutterable
fondness
oh
willy
willy
willy
my
son
my
son
and
again
her
lips
were
laid
closely
to
his
hammond
now
interfered
and
endeavored
to
remove
his
wife
fearing
for
the
consequence
upon
his
son
do
father
said
willy
let
her
remain
i
am
not
excited
nor
disturbed
i
am
glad
that
she
is
here
now
it
will
be
best
for
us
both
you
must
not
excite
him
dear
said
hammond
he
is
very
weak
i
not
excite
him
answered
the
mother
i
not
speak
a
word
there
love
and
she
laid
her
fingers
softly
upon
the
lips
of
her
son
do
speak
a
single
word
for
only
a
few
moments
did
she
sit
with
the
quiet
formality
of
a
nurse
who
feels
how
much
depends
on
the
repose
of
her
patient
then
she
began
weeping
moaning
and
wringing
her
hands
mother
the
feeble
voice
of
willy
stilled
instantly
the
tempest
of
feeling
mother
kiss
me
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
are
you
there
mother
his
eyes
moved
about
with
a
straining
motion
yes
love
here
i
am
i
do
see
you
mother
it
getting
so
dark
oh
mother
mother
he
shouted
suddenly
starting
up
and
throwing
himself
forward
upon
her
bosom
save
me
save
me
how
quickly
did
the
mother
clasp
her
arms
around
him
how
eagerly
did
she
strain
him
to
her
bosom
the
doctor
fearing
the
worst
consequences
now
came
forward
and
endeavored
to
release
the
arms
of
hammond
but
she
resisted
every
attempt
to
do
so
i
will
save
you
my
son
she
murmured
in
the
ear
of
the
young
man
your
mother
will
protect
you
oh
if
you
had
never
left
her
side
nothing
on
earth
could
have
done
you
harm
he
is
dead
i
heard
the
doctor
whisper
and
a
thrill
of
horror
went
through
me
the
words
reached
the
ears
of
hammond
and
his
groan
was
one
of
almost
mortal
agony
who
says
he
is
dead
came
sharply
from
the
lips
of
the
mother
as
she
pressed
the
form
of
her
child
back
upon
the
bed
from
which
he
had
sprung
to
her
arms
and
looked
wildly
upon
his
face
one
long
scream
of
horror
told
of
her
convictions
and
she
fell
lifeless
across
the
body
of
her
dead
son
all
in
the
room
believed
that
hammond
had
only
fainted
but
the
doctor
perplexed
troubled
countenance
as
he
ordered
her
carried
into
another
apartment
and
the
ghastliness
of
her
face
when
it
was
upturned
to
the
light
suggested
to
every
one
what
proved
to
be
true
even
to
her
obscured
perceptions
the
consciousness
that
her
son
was
dead
came
with
a
terrible
vividness
so
terrible
that
it
extinguished
her
life
like
fire
among
dry
stubble
ran
the
news
of
this
fearful
event
through
cedarville
the
whole
town
was
wild
with
excitement
the
prominent
fact
that
willy
hammond
had
been
murdered
by
green
whose
real
profession
was
known
by
many
and
now
declared
to
all
was
on
every
tongue
but
a
hundred
different
and
exaggerated
stories
as
to
the
cause
and
the
particulars
of
the
event
were
in
circulation
by
the
time
preparations
to
remove
the
dead
bodies
of
mother
and
son
from
the
sickle
and
sheaf
to
the
residence
of
hammond
were
completed
hundreds
of
people
men
women
and
children
were
assembled
around
the
tavern
and
many
voices
were
clamorous
for
green
while
some
called
out
for
judge
lyman
whose
name
it
thus
appeared
had
become
associated
in
the
minds
of
the
people
with
the
murderous
affair
the
appearance
in
the
midst
of
this
excitement
of
the
two
dead
bodies
borne
forth
on
settees
did
not
tend
to
allay
the
feverish
state
of
indignation
that
prevailed
from
more
than
one
voice
i
heard
the
words
lynch
the
scoundrel
a
part
of
the
crowd
followed
the
sad
procession
while
the
greater
portion
consisting
of
men
remained
about
the
tavern
all
bodies
no
matter
for
what
purpose
assembled
quickly
find
leading
spirits
who
feeling
the
great
moving
impulse
give
it
voice
and
direction
it
was
so
in
this
case
intense
indignation
against
green
was
firing
every
bosom
and
when
a
man
elevated
himself
a
few
feet
above
the
agitated
mass
of
humanity
and
cried
out
the
murderer
must
not
escape
a
wild
responding
shout
terrible
in
its
fierceness
made
the
air
quiver
let
ten
men
be
chosen
to
search
the
house
and
premises
said
the
leading
spirit
ay
ay
choose
them
name
them
was
quickly
answered
ten
men
were
called
by
name
who
instantly
stepped
in
front
of
the
crowd
search
everywhere
from
garret
to
cellar
from
hayloft
to
everywhere
everywhere
cried
the
man
and
instantly
the
ten
men
entered
the
house
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
crowd
waited
with
increasing
signs
of
impatience
these
delegates
at
length
appeared
with
the
announcement
that
green
was
nowhere
about
the
premises
it
was
received
with
a
groan
let
no
man
in
cedarville
do
a
stroke
of
work
until
the
murderer
is
found
now
shouted
the
individual
who
still
occupied
his
elevated
position
agreed
agreed
no
work
in
cedarville
until
the
murderer
is
found
rang
out
fiercely
let
all
who
have
horses
saddle
and
bridle
them
as
quickly
as
possible
and
assemble
mounted
at
the
court
house
about
fifty
men
left
the
crowd
hastily
let
the
crowd
part
in
the
centre
up
and
down
the
road
starting
from
a
line
in
front
of
me
this
order
was
obeyed
separate
again
taking
the
centre
of
the
road
for
a
line
four
distinct
bodies
of
men
stood
now
in
front
of
the
tavern
now
search
for
the
murderer
in
every
nook
and
corner
for
a
distance
of
three
miles
from
this
spot
each
party
keeping
to
its
own
section
the
road
being
one
dividing
line
and
a
line
through
the
centre
of
this
tavern
the
other
the
horsemen
will
pursue
the
wretch
to
a
greater
distance
more
than
a
hundred
acquiescing
voices
responded
to
this
as
the
man
sprung
down
from
his
elevation
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
which
began
instantly
to
move
away
on
its
appointed
mission
as
the
hours
went
by
one
and
another
and
another
of
the
searching
party
returned
to
the
village
wearied
with
their
efforts
or
confident
that
the
murderer
had
made
good
his
escape
the
horsemen
too
began
to
come
in
during
the
afternoon
and
by
sundown
the
last
of
them
worn
out
and
disappointed
made
their
appearance
for
hours
after
the
exciting
events
of
the
forenoon
there
were
but
few
visitors
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
slade
who
did
not
show
himself
among
the
crowd
came
down
soon
after
its
dispersion
he
had
shaved
and
put
on
clean
linen
but
still
bore
many
evidences
of
a
night
spent
without
sleep
his
eyes
were
red
and
heavy
and
the
eyelids
swollen
while
his
skin
was
relaxed
and
colorless
as
he
descended
the
stairs
i
was
walking
in
the
passage
he
looked
shy
at
me
and
merely
nodded
guilt
was
written
plainly
on
his
countenance
and
with
it
was
blended
anxiety
and
alarm
that
he
might
be
involved
in
trouble
he
had
reason
to
fear
for
he
was
one
of
the
party
engaged
in
gambling
in
room
as
both
jacobs
and
i
had
witnessed
this
is
dreadful
business
said
he
as
we
met
face
to
face
half
an
hour
afterward
he
did
not
look
me
steadily
in
the
eyes
it
is
horrible
i
answered
to
corrupt
and
ruin
a
young
man
and
then
murder
him
there
are
few
deeds
in
the
catalogue
of
crime
blacker
than
this
it
was
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
said
the
landlord
with
something
of
an
apology
in
his
manner
green
never
meant
to
kill
him
in
peaceful
intercourse
with
his
why
did
he
carry
a
deadly
weapon
there
was
murder
in
his
heart
sir
that
is
speaking
very
strongly
not
stronger
than
the
facts
will
warrant
i
replied
that
green
is
a
murderer
in
heart
it
needed
not
this
awful
consummation
to
show
with
a
cool
deliberate
purpose
he
has
sought
from
the
beginning
to
destroy
young
hammond
it
is
hardly
fair
answered
slade
in
the
present
feverish
excitement
against
green
to
assume
such
a
questionable
position
it
may
do
him
a
great
wrong
did
willy
hammond
speak
only
idle
words
when
he
accused
green
of
having
followed
him
like
a
thirsty
bloodhound
of
having
robbed
and
cheated
and
debased
him
from
the
beginning
he
was
terribly
excited
at
the
moment
yes
said
i
no
ear
that
heard
his
words
could
for
an
instant
doubt
that
they
were
truthful
utterances
wrung
from
a
maddened
heart
my
earnest
positive
manner
had
its
effect
upon
slade
he
knew
that
what
i
asserted
the
whole
history
of
green
intercourse
with
young
hammond
would
prove
and
he
had
moreover
the
guilty
consciousness
of
being
a
party
to
the
young
man
ruin
his
eyes
cowered
beneath
the
steady
gaze
i
fixed
upon
him
i
thought
of
him
as
one
implicated
in
the
murder
and
my
thoughts
must
have
been
visible
in
my
face
one
murder
will
not
justify
another
said
he
there
is
no
justification
for
murder
on
any
plea
was
my
response
and
yet
if
these
infuriated
men
find
green
they
will
murder
him
i
hope
not
indignation
at
a
horrible
crime
has
fearfully
excited
the
people
but
i
think
their
sense
of
justice
is
strong
enough
to
prevent
the
consequences
you
apprehend
i
would
not
like
to
be
in
green
shoes
said
the
landlord
with
an
uneasy
movement
i
looked
him
closely
in
the
face
it
was
the
punishment
of
the
crime
that
seemed
so
fearful
in
his
eyes
not
the
crime
itself
alas
how
the
corrupting
traffic
had
debased
him
my
words
were
so
little
relished
by
slade
that
he
found
some
ready
excuse
to
leave
me
i
saw
little
more
of
him
during
the
day
as
evening
began
to
fall
the
gambler
unsuccessful
pursuers
one
after
another
found
their
way
to
the
tavern
and
by
the
time
night
had
fairly
closed
in
the
was
crowded
with
excited
and
angry
men
chafing
over
their
disappointment
and
loud
in
their
threats
of
vengeance
that
green
had
made
good
his
escape
was
now
the
general
belief
and
the
stronger
this
conviction
became
the
more
steadily
did
the
current
of
passion
begin
to
set
in
a
new
direction
it
had
become
known
to
every
one
that
besides
green
and
young
hammond
judge
lyman
and
slade
were
in
the
room
engaged
in
playing
cards
the
merest
suggestion
as
to
the
complicity
of
these
two
men
with
green
in
ruining
hammond
and
thus
driving
him
mad
was
enough
to
excite
strong
feelings
against
them
and
now
that
the
mob
had
been
cheated
out
of
its
victim
its
indignation
sought
eagerly
some
new
channel
where
slade
some
one
asked
in
a
loud
voice
from
the
centre
of
the
crowded
why
does
he
keep
himself
out
of
sight
yes
where
the
landlord
half
a
dozen
voices
responded
did
he
go
on
the
hunt
some
one
inquired
no
no
no
ran
around
the
room
not
he
and
yet
the
murder
was
committed
in
his
own
house
and
before
his
own
eyes
yes
before
his
own
eyes
repeated
one
and
another
indignantly
where
slade
where
the
landlord
has
anybody
seen
him
tonight
matthew
where
simon
slade
from
lip
to
lip
passed
these
interrogations
while
the
crowd
of
men
became
agitated
and
swayed
to
and
fro
i
do
think
he
home
answered
the
in
a
hesitating
manner
and
with
visible
alarm
how
long
since
he
was
here
i
have
seen
him
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
a
lie
was
sharply
said
who
says
it
a
lie
matthew
affected
to
be
strongly
indignant
i
do
and
a
rough
man
confronted
him
what
right
have
you
to
say
so
asked
matthew
cooling
off
considerably
because
you
lie
said
the
man
boldly
you
seen
him
within
a
less
time
than
half
an
hour
and
well
you
know
it
now
if
you
wish
to
keep
yourself
out
of
this
trouble
answer
truly
we
are
in
no
mood
to
deal
with
liars
or
equivocators
where
is
simon
slade
i
do
not
know
replied
matthew
firmly
is
he
in
the
house
he
may
be
or
he
may
not
be
i
am
just
as
ignorant
of
his
exact
whereabouts
as
you
are
will
you
look
for
him
matthew
stepped
to
the
door
opening
from
behind
the
bar
and
called
the
name
of
frank
what
wanted
growled
the
boy
is
your
father
in
the
house
i
do
know
nor
do
care
was
responded
in
the
same
ungracious
manner
someone
bring
him
into
the
and
we
see
if
we
ca
make
him
care
a
little
the
suggestion
was
no
sooner
made
than
two
men
glided
behind
the
bar
and
passed
into
the
room
from
whence
the
voice
of
frank
had
issued
a
moment
after
they
reappeared
each
grasping
an
arm
of
the
boy
and
bearing
him
like
a
weak
child
between
them
he
looked
thoroughly
frightened
at
this
invasion
of
his
liberty
see
here
young
man
one
of
the
leading
spirits
of
the
crowd
addressed
him
as
soon
as
he
was
brought
in
front
of
the
counter
if
you
wish
to
keep
out
of
trouble
answer
our
questions
at
once
and
to
the
point
we
are
in
no
mood
for
trifling
where
your
father
somewhere
about
the
house
i
believe
frank
replied
in
an
humble
tone
he
was
no
little
scared
at
the
summary
manner
with
which
he
had
been
treated
how
long
since
you
saw
him
not
long
ago
ten
minutes
no
nearly
half
an
hour
where
was
he
then
he
was
going
very
well
we
want
him
see
him
and
tell
him
so
frank
went
into
the
house
but
came
back
into
the
after
an
absence
of
nearly
five
minutes
and
said
that
he
could
not
find
his
father
anywhere
where
is
he
then
was
angrily
demanded
indeed
gentlemen
i
do
know
frank
anxious
look
and
frightened
manner
showed
that
he
spoke
truly
there
something
wrong
about
this
something
wrong
wrong
said
one
of
the
men
why
should
he
be
absent
now
why
has
he
taken
no
steps
to
secure
the
man
who
committed
a
murder
in
his
own
house
and
before
his
own
eyes
i
should
wonder
if
he
aided
him
to
escape
said
another
making
this
serious
charge
with
a
restlessness
and
want
of
evidence
that
illustrated
the
reckless
and
unjust
spirit
by
which
the
mob
is
ever
governed
no
doubt
of
it
in
the
least
was
the
quick
and
positive
response
and
at
once
this
erroneous
conviction
seized
upon
every
one
not
a
single
fact
was
presented
the
simple
bold
assertion
that
no
doubt
existed
in
the
mind
of
one
man
as
to
slade
having
aided
green
to
escape
was
sufficient
for
the
unreflecting
mob
where
is
he
where
is
he
let
us
find
him
he
knows
where
green
is
and
he
shall
reveal
the
secret
this
was
enough
the
passions
of
the
crowd
were
at
fever
heat
again
two
or
three
men
were
chosen
to
search
the
house
and
premises
while
others
dispersed
to
take
a
wider
range
one
of
the
men
who
volunteered
to
go
over
the
house
was
a
person
named
lyon
with
whom
i
had
formed
some
acquaintance
and
several
times
conversed
with
on
the
state
of
affairs
in
cedarville
he
still
remained
too
good
a
customer
at
the
bar
i
left
the
bar
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
and
went
up
to
my
room
we
walked
side
by
side
and
parted
at
my
door
i
going
in
and
he
continuing
on
to
make
his
searches
i
felt
of
course
anxious
and
much
excited
as
well
in
consequence
of
the
events
of
the
day
as
the
present
aspect
of
things
my
head
was
aching
violently
and
in
the
hope
of
getting
relief
i
laid
myself
down
i
had
already
lighted
a
candle
and
turned
the
key
in
my
door
to
prevent
intrusion
only
for
a
short
time
did
i
lie
listening
to
the
hum
of
voices
that
came
with
a
hoarse
murmur
from
below
to
the
sound
of
feet
moving
along
the
passages
and
to
the
continual
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
when
something
like
suppressed
breathing
reached
my
ears
i
started
up
instantly
and
listened
but
my
quickened
pulses
were
now
audible
to
my
own
sense
and
obscured
what
was
external
it
is
only
imagination
i
said
to
myself
still
i
sat
upright
listening
satisfied
at
length
that
all
was
mere
fancy
i
laid
myself
back
on
the
pillow
and
tried
to
turn
my
thoughts
away
from
the
suggested
idea
that
some
one
was
in
the
room
scarcely
had
i
succeeded
in
this
when
my
heart
gave
a
new
impulse
as
a
sound
like
a
movement
fell
upon
my
ears
mere
fancy
i
said
to
myself
as
some
one
went
past
the
door
at
the
moment
my
mind
is
overexcited
still
i
raised
my
head
supporting
it
with
my
hand
and
listened
directing
my
attention
inside
and
not
outside
of
the
room
i
was
about
letting
my
head
fall
back
upon
the
pillow
when
a
slight
cough
so
distinct
as
not
to
be
mistaken
caused
me
to
spring
to
the
floor
and
look
under
the
bed
the
mystery
was
explained
a
pair
of
eyes
glittered
in
the
candlelight
the
fugitive
green
was
under
my
bed
for
some
moments
i
stood
looking
at
him
so
astonished
that
i
had
neither
utterance
nor
decision
while
he
glared
at
me
with
a
fierce
defiance
i
saw
that
he
was
clutching
a
revolver
understand
he
said
in
a
grating
whisper
that
i
am
not
to
be
taken
alive
i
let
the
blanket
which
had
concealed
him
from
view
fall
from
my
hand
and
then
tried
to
collect
my
thoughts
escape
is
impossible
said
i
again
lifting
the
temporary
curtain
by
which
he
was
hid
the
whole
town
is
armed
and
on
the
search
and
should
you
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
mob
in
its
present
state
of
exasperation
your
life
would
not
be
safe
an
instant
remain
then
quiet
where
you
are
until
i
can
see
the
sheriff
to
whom
you
had
better
resign
yourself
for
there
little
chance
for
you
except
under
his
protection
after
a
brief
parley
he
consented
that
things
should
take
this
course
and
i
went
out
locking
the
room
door
after
me
and
started
in
search
of
the
sheriff
on
the
information
i
gave
the
sheriff
acted
promptly
with
five
officers
fully
armed
for
defence
in
case
an
effort
were
made
to
get
the
prisoner
out
of
their
hands
he
repaired
immediately
to
the
sickle
and
sheaf
i
had
given
the
key
of
my
room
into
his
possession
the
appearance
of
the
sheriff
with
his
posse
was
sufficient
to
start
the
suggestion
that
green
was
somewhere
concealed
in
the
house
and
a
suggestion
was
only
needed
to
cause
the
fact
to
be
assumed
and
unhesitatingly
declared
intelligence
went
through
the
reassembling
crowd
like
an
electric
current
and
ere
the
sheriff
could
manacle
and
lead
forth
his
prisoner
the
stairway
down
which
he
had
to
come
was
packed
with
bodies
and
echoing
with
oaths
and
maledictions
gentlemen
clear
the
way
cried
the
sheriff
as
he
appeared
with
the
white
and
trembling
culprit
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
murderer
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
law
and
will
meet
the
sure
consequences
of
his
crime
a
shout
of
execration
rent
the
air
but
not
a
single
individual
stirred
give
way
there
give
way
and
the
sheriff
took
a
step
or
two
forward
but
the
prisoner
held
back
oh
the
murdering
villain
the
cursed
blackleg
where
willy
hammond
was
heard
distinctly
above
the
confused
mingling
of
voices
gentlemen
the
law
must
have
its
course
and
no
good
citizen
will
oppose
the
law
it
is
made
for
your
protection
for
mine
and
for
that
of
the
prisoner
lynch
law
is
good
enough
for
him
shouted
a
savage
voice
hand
him
over
to
us
sheriff
and
we
save
you
the
trouble
of
hanging
him
and
the
county
the
cost
of
the
gallows
we
do
the
business
right
five
men
each
armed
with
a
revolver
now
ranged
themselves
around
the
sheriff
and
the
latter
said
firmly
it
is
my
duty
to
see
this
man
safely
conveyed
to
prison
and
i
going
to
do
my
duty
if
there
is
any
more
blood
shed
here
the
blame
will
rest
with
you
and
the
body
of
officers
pressed
forward
the
mob
slowly
retreating
before
them
green
overwhelmed
with
terror
held
back
i
was
standing
where
i
could
see
his
face
it
was
ghastly
with
mortal
fear
grasping
his
pinioned
arms
the
sheriff
forced
him
onward
after
contending
with
the
crowd
for
nearly
ten
minutes
the
officers
gained
the
passage
below
but
the
mob
was
denser
here
and
blocking
up
the
door
resolutely
maintained
their
position
again
and
again
the
sheriff
appealed
to
the
good
sense
and
justice
of
the
people
the
prisoner
will
have
to
stand
a
trial
and
the
law

sternly
responded
who
be

in
the
case

asked
why
judge
lyman
was
contemptuously
answered
a
blackleg

shouted
by
two
or
three
voices
blackleg

and

oh

was
in

judge

was
answered
back
it
wo
do
sheriff
there
no
law
in
the
country
to

but
lynch
law
and
that
the
scoundrel
must
have
give
him
to
us
never
on
men
with
the
prisoner
cried
the
sheriff
resolutely
and
the
posse
made
a
rush
toward
the
door
bearing
back
the
resisting
and
now
infuriated
crowd
shouts
cries
oaths
and
savage
imprecations
blended
in
wild
discord
in
the
midst
of
which
my
blood
was
chilled
by
the
sharp
crack
of
a
pistol
another
and
another
shot
followed
and
then
as
a
cry
of
pain
thrilled
the
air
the
fierce
storm
hushed
its
fury
in
an
instant
who
shot
is
he
killed
there
was
a
breathless
eagerness
for
the
answer
it
the
gambler
was
replied
somebody
has
shot
green
a
low
muttered
invective
against
the
victim
was
heard
here
and
there
but
the
announcement
was
not
received
with
a
shout
of
exultation
though
there
was
scarcely
a
heart
that
did
not
feel
pleasure
at
the
sacrifice
of
harvey
green
life
it
was
true
as
had
been
declared
whether
the
shot
were
aimed
deliberately
or
guided
by
an
unseen
hand
to
the
heart
of
the
gambler
was
never
known
nor
did
the
most
careful
examination
instituted
afterward
by
the
county
elicit
any
information
that
even
directed
suspicion
toward
the
individual
who
became
the
agent
of
his
death
at
the
coroner
inquest
held
over
the
dead
body
of
harvey
green
simon
slade
was
present
where
he
had
concealed
himself
while
the
mob
were
in
search
of
him
was
not
known
he
looked
haggard
and
his
eyes
were
anxious
and
restless
two
murders
in
his
house
occurring
in
a
single
day
were
quite
enough
to
darken
his
spirits
and
the
more
so
as
his
relations
with
both
the
victims
were
not
of
a
character
to
awaken
any
thing
but
as
for
the
mob
in
the
death
of
green
its
eager
thirst
for
vengeance
was
satisfied
nothing
more
was
said
against
slade
as
a
participator
in
the
ruin
and
death
of
young
hammond
the
popular
feeling
was
one
of
pity
rather
than
indignation
toward
the
landlord
for
it
was
seen
that
he
was
deeply
troubled
one
thing
i
noticed
and
it
was
that
the
drinking
at
the
bar
was
not
suspended
for
a
moment
a
large
proportion
of
those
who
made
up
the
crowd
of
green
angry
pursuers
were
excited
by
drink
as
well
as
indignation
and
i
am
very
sure
that
but
for
the
maddening
effects
of
liquor
the
fatal
shot
would
never
have
been
fired
after
the
fearful
catastrophe
and
when
every
mind
was
sobered
or
ought
to
have
been
sobered
the
crowd
returned
to
the
where
the
drinking
was
renewed
so
rapid
were
the
calls
for
liquor
that
both
matthew
and
frank
the
landlord
son
were
kept
busy
mixing
the
various
compounds
demanded
by
the
thirsty
customers
from
the
constant
stream
of
human
beings
that
flowed
toward
the
sickle
and
sheaf
after
the
news
of
green
discovery
and
death
went
forth
it
seemed
as
if
every
man
and
boy
within
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
had
received
intelligence
of
the
event
few
very
of
those
who
came
but
went
first
into
the
and
nearly
all
who
entered
the
called
for
liquor
in
an
hour
after
the
death
of
green
the
fact
that
his
dead
body
was
laid
out
in
the
room
immediately
adjoining
seemed
utterly
to
pass
from
the
consciousness
of
every
one
in
the
bar
the
calls
for
liquor
were
incessant
and
as
the
excitement
of
drink
increased
voices
grew
louder
and
oaths
more
plentiful
while
the
sounds
of
laughter
ceased
not
for
an
instant
they
giving
him
a
regular
irish
wake
i
heard
remarked
with
a
brutal
laugh
i
turned
to
the
speaker
and
to
my
great
surprise
saw
that
it
was
judge
lyman
more
under
the
influence
of
drink
than
i
remembered
to
have
seen
him
he
was
about
the
last
man
i
expected
to
find
here
if
he
knew
of
the
strong
indignation
expressed
toward
him
a
little
while
before
by
some
of
the
very
men
now
excited
with
liquor
his
own
free
drinking
had
extinguished
fear
yes
curse
him
was
the
answer
if
they
have
a
particularly
hot
corner
down
below
i
hope
he
made
its
acquaintance
before
this
most
likely
he
smelled
brimstone
chuckled
the
judge
smelled
it
if
old
clubfoot
has
treated
him
with
a
long
before
this
he
has
done
his
duty
if
i
thought
as
much
vote
for
sending
his
majesty
a
remonstrance
forthwith
ha
ha
laughed
the
judge
you
warm
on
the
subject
ai
i
the
blackleg
scoundrel
hell
too
good
for
him
do
let
your
indignation
run
into
profanity
said
judge
lyman
trying
to
assume
a
serious
air
but
the
muscles
of
his
face
but
feebly
obeyed
his
will
feeble
effort
profanity
poh
i
do
call
that
profanity
it
only
speaking
out
in
meeting
as
they
say
it
only
calling
black
black
and
white
white
you
believe
in
a
hell
do
you
judge
i
suppose
there
is
one
though
i
do
know
very
certain
you
better
be
certain
said
the
other
meaningly
why
so
oh
because
if
there
is
one
and
you
do
cut
your
cards
a
little
differently
you
be
apt
to
find
it
at
the
end
of
your
journey
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
the
judge
retreating
somewhat
into
himself
and
trying
to
look
dignified
just
what
i
say
was
unhesitatingly
answered
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
any
thing
asked
the
judge
whose
brows
were
beginning
to
knit
themselves
nobody
thinks
you
a
saint
replied
the
man
roughly
i
never
professed
to
be
and
it
is
said
the
man
fixed
his
gaze
almost
insultingly
upon
judge
lyman
face
that
you
get
about
as
hot
a
corner
in
the
lower
regions
as
is
to
be
found
there
whenever
you
make
the
journey
in
that
direction
you
are
insolent
exclaimed
the
judge
his
face
becoming
inflamed
take
care
what
you
say
sir
the
man
spoke
threateningly
you
better
take
care
what
you
say
so
i
will
replied
the
other
but
what
to
pay
here
inquired
a
third
party
coming
up
at
the
moment
and
interrupting
the
speaker
the
devil
will
be
to
pay
said
judge
lyman
if
somebody
do
look
out
sharp
do
you
mean
that
for
me
ha
the
man
between
whom
and
himself
this
slight
contention
had
so
quickly
sprung
up
began
stripping
back
his
coat
sleeves
like
one
about
to
commence
boxing
i
mean
it
for
anybody
who
presumes
to
offer
me
an
insult
the
raised
voices
of
the
two
men
now
drew
toward
them
the
attention
of
every
one
in
the
the
devil
there
judge
lyman
i
heard
some
one
exclaim
in
a
tone
of
surprise
was
he
in
the
room
with
green
when
willy
hammond
was
murdered
asked
another
yes
he
was
and
what
more
it
is
said
he
had
been
playing
against
him
all
night
he
and
green
sharing
the
plunder
this
last
remark
came
distinctly
to
the
ears
of
lyman
who
started
to
his
feet
instantly
exclaiming
fiercely
whoever
says
that
is
a
cursed
liar
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
blow
staggered
him
against
the
wall
near
which
he
was
standing
another
blow
felled
him
and
then
his
assailant
sprang
over
his
prostrate
body
kicking
him
and
stamping
upon
his
face
and
breast
in
the
most
brutal
shocking
manner
kill
him
he
worse
than
green
somebody
cried
out
in
a
voice
so
full
of
cruelty
and
murder
that
it
made
my
blood
curdle
remember
willy
hammond
the
terrible
scene
that
followed
in
which
were
heard
a
confused
mingling
of
blows
cries
yells
and
horrible
oaths
continued
for
several
minutes
and
ceased
only
when
the
words
do
do
strike
him
any
more
he
dead
were
repeated
several
times
then
the
wild
strife
subsided
as
the
crowd
parted
from
around
the
body
of
judge
lyman
and
gave
way
i
caught
a
single
glance
at
his
face
it
was
covered
with
blood
and
every
feature
seemed
to
have
been
literally
trampled
down
until
all
was
a
level
surface
sickened
at
the
sight
i
passed
hastily
from
the
room
into
the
open
air
and
caught
my
breath
several
times
before
respiration
again
went
on
freely
as
i
stood
in
front
of
the
tavern
the
body
of
judge
lyman
was
borne
out
by
three
or
four
men
and
carried
off
in
the
direction
of
his
dwelling
is
he
dead
i
inquired
of
those
who
had
him
in
charge
no
was
the
answer
he
not
dead
but
terribly
beaten
and
they
passed
on
again
the
loud
voices
of
men
in
angry
strife
arose
in
the
i
did
not
return
there
to
learn
the
cause
or
to
witness
the
conduct
of
the
men
all
whose
worst
passions
were
stimulated
by
drink
into
the
wildest
fervor
as
i
was
entering
my
room
the
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
that
as
green
was
found
there
it
needed
only
the
bare
suggestion
that
i
had
aided
in
his
concealment
to
direct
toward
me
the
insane
fury
of
the
drunken
mob
it
is
not
safe
to
remain
here
i
said
this
to
myself
with
the
emphasis
of
a
strong
internal
conviction
against
this
my
mind
opposed
a
few
feeble
arguments
but
the
more
i
thought
of
the
matter
the
more
clearly
did
i
become
satisfied
that
to
attempt
to
pass
the
night
in
that
room
was
to
me
a
risk
it
was
not
prudent
to
assume
so
i
went
in
search
of
slade
to
ask
her
to
have
another
room
prepared
for
me
but
she
was
not
in
the
house
and
i
learned
upon
inquiry
that
since
the
murder
of
young
hammond
she
had
been
suffering
from
repeated
hysterical
and
fainting
fits
and
was
now
with
her
daughter
at
the
house
of
a
relative
whither
she
had
been
carried
early
in
the
afternoon
it
was
on
my
lip
to
request
the
chambermaid
to
give
me
another
room
but
this
i
felt
to
be
scarcely
prudent
for
if
the
popular
indignation
should
happen
to
turn
toward
me
the
servant
would
be
the
one
questioned
most
likely
as
to
where
i
had
removed
my
quarters
it
is
safe
to
stay
in
the
house
said
i
speaking
to
myself
two
perhaps
three
murders
have
been
committed
already
the
tiger
thirst
for
blood
has
been
stimulated
and
who
can
tell
how
quickly
he
may
spring
again
or
in
what
direction
even
while
i
said
this
there
came
up
from
the
louder
and
madder
shouts
then
blows
were
heard
mingled
with
cries
and
oaths
a
shuddering
sense
of
danger
oppressed
me
and
i
went
hastily
and
out
into
the
street
as
i
gained
the
passage
i
looked
into
the
where
the
body
of
green
was
laid
out
just
then
the
door
was
burst
open
by
a
fighting
party
who
had
been
thrown
in
their
fierce
contention
against
it
i
paused
only
for
a
moment
or
two
and
even
in
that
brief
period
of
time
saw
blows
exchanged
over
the
dead
body
of
the
gambler
this
is
no
place
for
me
i
said
almost
aloud
and
hurried
from
the
house
and
took
my
way
to
the
residence
of
a
gentleman
who
had
shown
me
many
kindnesses
during
my
visits
at
cedarville
there
was
needed
scarcely
a
word
of
representation
on
my
part
to
secure
the
cordial
tender
of
a
bed
what
a
change
it
seemed
almost
like
a
passage
from
pandemonium
to
a
heavenly
region
as
i
seated
myself
alone
in
the
quiet
chamber
a
cheerful
hospitality
had
assigned
me
and
mused
on
the
exciting
and
terrible
incidents
of
the
day
they
that
sow
the
wind
shall
reap
the
whirlwind
how
marked
had
been
the
realization
of
this
prophecy
couched
in
such
strong
but
beautiful
imagery
on
the
next
day
i
was
to
leave
cedarville
early
in
the
morning
i
repaired
to
the
sickle
and
sheaf
the
storm
was
over
and
all
was
calm
and
silent
as
desolation
hours
before
the
tempest
had
subsided
but
the
evidences
left
behind
of
its
ravaging
fury
were
fearful
to
look
upon
doors
chairs
windows
and
table
were
broken
and
even
the
strong
brass
rod
that
ornamented
the
bar
had
been
partially
wrenched
from
its
fastenings
by
strong
hands
under
an
impulse
of
murder
that
only
lacked
a
weapon
to
execute
its
fiendish
purpose
stains
of
blood
in
drops
marks
and
even
pools
were
to
be
seen
all
over
the
and
passage
floors
and
in
many
places
on
the
porch
in
the
still
lay
the
body
of
green
here
too
were
many
signs
to
indicate
a
fierce
struggle
the
was
smashed
to
a
hundred
pieces
and
the
shivered
fragments
lay
yet
untouched
upon
the
floor
a
chair
which
it
was
plain
had
been
used
as
a
weapon
of
assault
had
two
of
its
legs
broken
short
off
and
was
thrown
into
a
corner
and
even
the
bearers
on
which
the
dead
man
lay
were
pushed
from
their
true
position
showing
that
even
in
its
mortal
sleep
the
body
of
green
had
felt
the
jarring
strife
of
elements
he
had
himself
helped
to
awaken
into
mad
activity
from
his
face
the
sheet
had
been
drawn
aside
but
no
hand
ventured
to
replace
it
and
there
it
lay
in
its
ghastly
paleness
exposed
to
the
light
and
covered
with
restless
flies
attracted
by
the
first
faint
odors
of
putridity
with
gaze
averted
i
approached
the
body
and
drew
the
covering
decently
over
it
no
person
was
in
the
bar
i
went
out
into
the
where
i
met
the
hostler
with
his
head
bound
up
there
was
a
dark
blue
circle
around
one
of
his
eyes
and
an
red
scar
on
his
cheek
where
is
mr
slade
i
inquired
in
bed
and
likely
to
keep
it
for
a
week
was
answered
how
comes
that
naturally
enough
there
was
fighting
all
around
last
night
and
he
had
to
come
in
for
a
share
the
fool
if
he
just
held
his
tongue
he
might
have
come
out
of
it
with
a
whole
skin
but
when
the
rum
is
in
the
wit
is
out
with
him
it
cost
me
a
black
eye
and
a
broken
head
for
how
could
i
stand
by
and
see
him
murdered
outright
is
he
very
badly
injured
i
rather
think
he
is
one
eye
is
clean
gone
oh
shocking
it
shocking
enough
and
no
mistake
lost
an
eye
too
true
sir
the
doctor
saw
him
this
morning
and
says
the
eye
was
fairly
gouged
out
and
broken
up
in
fact
when
we
carried
him
upstairs
for
dead
last
night
his
eye
was
lying
upon
his
cheek
i
pushed
it
back
with
my
own
hand
oh
horrible
the
relation
made
me
sick
is
he
otherwise
much
injured
the
doctor
thinks
there
are
some
bad
hurts
inside
why
they
kicked
and
trampled
upon
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
wild
beast
i
never
saw
such
a
pack
of
devils
in
my
life
so
much
for
rum
said
i
yes
sir
so
much
for
rum
was
the
emphatic
response
it
was
the
rum
and
nothing
else
why
some
of
the
very
men
who
acted
the
most
like
tigers
and
devils
are
as
harmless
persons
as
you
will
find
in
cedarville
when
sober
yes
sir
it
was
the
rum
and
nothing
else
rum
gave
me
this
broken
head
and
black
eye
so
you
had
been
drinking
also
oh
yes
there
no
use
in
denying
that
liquor
does
you
harm
nobody
knows
that
better
than
i
do
why
do
you
drink
then
oh
just
because
it
comes
in
the
way
liquor
is
under
my
eyes
and
nose
all
the
time
and
it
as
natural
as
breathing
to
take
a
little
now
and
then
and
when
i
do
think
of
it
myself
somebody
will
think
of
it
for
me
and
say
sam
let
take
something
so
you
see
for
a
body
such
as
i
am
there
is
much
help
for
it
but
ai
you
afraid
to
go
on
in
this
way
do
you
know
where
it
will
all
end
just
as
well
as
anybody
it
will
make
an
end
of
me
or
of
all
that
is
good
in
me
rum
and
ruin
you
know
sir
they
go
together
like
twin
brothers
why
do
you
get
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
said
i
it
easy
enough
to
ask
that
question
sir
but
how
am
i
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
where
shall
i
go
and
not
find
a
bar
in
my
road
and
somebody
to
say
sam
let
take
a
drink
it
ca
be
done
sir
nohow
i
a
hostler
and
i
do
know
how
to
be
anything
else
ca
you
work
on
a
farm
yes
i
can
do
something
in
that
way
but
when
there
are
taverns
and
as
many
as
three
or
four
in
every
mile
all
over
the
country
how
are
you
to
keep
clear
of
them
figure
me
out
that
i
think
you
better
vote
on
the
maine
law
side
at
next
election
said
i
faith
and
i
did
it
last
time
replied
the
man
with
a
brightening
face
and
if
i
spared
i
go
the
same
ticket
next
year
what
do
you
think
of
the
law
i
asked
think
of
it
bless
your
heart
if
i
was
a
praying
man
which
i
sorry
to
say
i
ai
my
mother
was
a
pious
woman
sir
his
voice
fell
and
slightly
trembled
if
i
was
a
praying
man
sir
i
pray
night
and
morning
and
twenty
times
every
day
of
my
life
for
god
to
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
give
us
that
law
i
have
some
hope
then
but
i
have
much
as
it
is
there
no
use
in
trying
to
let
liquor
alone
do
many
drinking
men
think
as
you
do
i
can
count
up
a
dozen
or
two
myself
it
is
the
drinking
men
who
are
so
much
opposed
to
the
maine
law
as
your
politicians
they
throw
dust
in
the
people
eyes
about
it
and
make
a
great
many
who
know
nothing
at
all
of
the
evils
of
drinking
in
themselves
believe
some
bugbear
story
about
trampling
on
the
rights
of
i
do
know
who
nor
they
either
as
for
rights
i
never
could
see
any
right
they
had
to
get
rich
by
ruining
poor
devils
such
as
i
am
i
think
though
that
we
have
some
right
to
be
protected
against
them
the
ringing
of
a
bell
here
announced
the
arrival
of
some
traveler
and
the
hostler
left
me
i
learned
during
the
morning
that
matthew
the
and
also
the
son
of
slade
were
both
considerably
hurt
during
the
affrays
in
the
and
were
confined
temporarily
to
their
beds
slade
still
continued
in
a
distressing
and
dangerous
state
judge
lyman
though
shockingly
injured
was
not
thought
to
be
in
a
critical
condition
a
busy
day
the
sheriff
had
of
it
making
arrests
of
various
parties
engaged
in
the
last
night
affairs
even
slade
unable
as
he
was
to
lift
his
head
from
his
pillow
was
required
to
give
heavy
bail
for
his
appearance
at
court
happily
i
escaped
the
inconvenience
of
being
held
to
appear
as
a
witness
and
early
in
the
afternoon
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
myself
rapidly
borne
away
in
the
it
was
two
years
before
i
entered
the
pleasant
village
of
cedarville
again
night
the
eighth
reaping
the
whirlwind
i
was
in
washington
city
during
the
succeeding
month
it
was
the
short
or
closing
session
of
a
regular
congressional
term
the
implication
of
judge
lyman
in
the
affair
of
green
and
young
hammond
had
brought
him
into
such
bad
odor
in
cedarville
and
the
whole
district
from
which
he
had
been
chosen
that
his
party
deemed
it
wise
to
set
him
aside
and
take
up
a
candidate
less
likely
to
meet
with
so
strong
and
it
might
be
successful
an
opposition
by
so
doing
they
were
able
to
secure
the
election
once
more
against
the
growing
temperance
party
which
succeeded
however
in
getting
a
maine
law
man
into
the
state
legislature
it
was
therefore
judge
lyman
last
winter
at
the
federal
capital
while
seated
in
the
at
fuller
hotel
about
noon
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
in
washington
i
noticed
an
individual
whose
face
looked
familiar
come
in
and
glance
about
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
while
yet
questioning
my
mind
who
he
could
be
i
heard
a
man
remark
to
a
person
with
whom
he
had
been
conversing
there
that
vagabond
member
away
from
his
place
in
the
house
again
who
inquired
the
other
why
judge
lyman
was
answered
oh
said
the
other
indifferently
it
is
of
much
consequence
precious
little
wisdom
does
he
add
to
that
intelligent
body
his
vote
is
worth
something
at
least
when
important
questions
are
at
stake
what
does
he
charge
for
it
was
coolly
inquired
there
was
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
an
arching
of
the
eyebrows
but
no
answer
i
in
earnest
though
in
the
question
said
the
last
speaker
not
in
saying
that
lyman
will
sell
his
vote
to
the
highest
bidders
that
will
depend
altogether
upon
whom
the
bidders
may
be
they
must
be
men
who
have
something
to
lose
as
well
as
gain
men
not
at
all
likely
to
bruit
the
matter
and
in
serving
whose
personal
interests
no
abandonment
of
party
is
required
judge
lyman
is
always
on
good
terms
with
the
lobby
members
and
may
be
found
in
company
with
some
of
them
daily
doubtless
his
absence
from
the
house
now
is
for
the
purpose
of
a
special
meeting
with
gentlemen
who
are
ready
to
pay
well
for
votes
in
favor
of
some
bill
making
appropriations
of
public
money
for
private
or
corporate
benefit
you
certainly
can
not
mean
all
you
say
to
be
taken
in
its
broadest
sense
was
replied
to
this
yes
in
its
very
broadest
into
just
this
deep
of
moral
and
political
degradation
has
this
man
fallen
disgracing
his
constituents
and
dishonoring
his
country
his
presence
at
washington
does
speak
very
highly
in
favor
of
the
community
he
represents
no
still
as
things
are
now
we
can
not
judge
of
the
moral
worth
of
a
community
by
the
man
sent
from
it
to
congress
representatives
show
merely
the
strength
of
parties
the
candidate
chosen
in
party
primary
meetings
is
not
selected
because
he
is
the
best
man
they
have
and
the
one
fittest
to
legislate
wisely
in
national
affairs
but
he
who
happens
to
have
the
strongest
personal
friends
among
those
who
nominate
or
who
is
most
likely
to
poll
the
highest
vote
this
is
why
we
find
in
congress
such
a
large
preponderance
of
men
a
man
such
as
you
represent
judge
lyman
to
be
would
sell
his
country
like
another
arnold
yes
if
the
bid
were
high
enough
does
he
gamble
gambling
i
might
say
is
a
part
of
his
profession
very
few
nights
pass
i
am
told
without
finding
him
at
the
i
heard
no
more
at
all
this
i
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
for
my
knowledge
of
the
man
antecedents
had
prepared
me
for
allegations
quite
as
bad
as
these
during
the
week
i
spent
at
the
federal
capital
i
had
several
opportunities
of
seeing
judge
lyman
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
in
the
house
only
when
the
yeas
and
nays
were
called
on
some
important
measure
or
a
vote
taken
on
a
bill
granting
special
privileges
in
the
latter
case
his
vote
as
i
noticed
was
generally
cast
on
the
affirmative
side
several
times
i
saw
him
staggering
on
the
avenue
and
once
brought
into
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
voting
in
so
drunken
a
state
that
he
had
to
be
supported
to
his
seat
and
even
worse
than
this
when
his
name
was
called
he
was
asleep
and
had
to
be
shaken
several
times
before
he
was
sufficiently
aroused
to
give
his
vote
happily
for
the
good
of
his
country
it
was
his
last
winter
in
washington
at
the
next
session
a
better
man
took
his
place
two
years
from
the
period
of
my
last
visit
to
cedarville
i
found
myself
approaching
that
quiet
village
again
as
the
came
in
view
and
house
after
house
became
visible
here
and
there
standing
out
in
pleasant
relief
against
the
green
background
of
woods
and
fields
all
the
exciting
events
which
rendered
my
last
visit
so
memorable
came
up
fresh
in
my
mind
i
was
yet
thinking
of
willy
hammond
dreadful
death
and
of
his
mother
whose
life
went
out
with
his
when
the
stage
rolled
by
their
old
homestead
oh
what
a
change
was
here
neglect
decay
and
dilapidation
were
visible
let
the
eye
fall
where
it
would
the
fences
were
down
here
and
there
the
hedges
once
so
green
and
nicely
trimmed
had
grown
rankly
in
some
places
but
were
stunted
and
dying
in
others
all
the
beautiful
walks
were
weedy
and
and
the
dead
the
garden
in
its
wealth
of
choice
and
beautiful
flowers
when
i
first
saw
it
was
lying
waste
a
for
hogs
a
glance
at
the
house
showed
a
broken
chimney
the
bricks
unremoved
from
the
spot
where
they
struck
the
ground
a
moss
grown
roof
with
a
large
limb
from
a
tree
lying
almost
balanced
over
the
eaves
and
threatening
to
fall
at
the
touch
of
the
first
that
swept
over
half
of
the
vines
that
clambered
about
the
portico
were
dead
and
the
rest
untrained
twined
themselves
in
wild
disorder
or
fell
groveling
to
the
earth
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
portico
was
broken
as
were
also
two
of
the
steps
that
went
up
to
it
the
windows
of
the
house
were
closed
but
the
door
stood
open
and
as
the
stage
went
past
my
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
upon
an
old
man
seated
in
the
hall
he
was
not
near
enough
to
the
door
for
me
to
get
a
view
of
his
face
but
the
white
flowing
hair
left
me
in
no
doubt
as
to
his
identity
it
was
judge
hammond
the
sickle
and
sheaf
was
yet
the
of
cedarville
and
there
a
few
minutes
afterward
i
found
myself
the
hand
of
change
had
been
here
also
the
first
object
that
attracted
my
attention
was
the
which
at
my
earlier
arrival
some
eight
or
nine
years
before
stood
up
in
its
new
white
garment
of
paint
as
straight
as
a
bearing
proudly
aloft
the
golden
sheaf
and
gleaming
sickle
now
the
post
dingy
and
shattered
and
worn
from
the
frequent
contact
of
wheels
and
gnawing
of
restless
horses
leaned
from
its
trim
perpendicular
at
an
angle
of
many
degrees
as
if
ashamed
of
the
faded
lying
symbol
it
bore
aloft
in
the
sunshine
around
the
post
was
a
filthy
in
which
a
hog
lay
grunting
out
its
sense
of
enjoyment
two
or
three
old
empty
whisky
barrels
lumbered
up
the
dirty
porch
on
which
a
coarse
bloated
man
sat
leaning
against
the
wall
his
chair
tipped
back
on
its
hind
legs
squinting
at
me
from
one
eye
as
i
left
the
stage
and
came
forward
toward
the
house
ah
is
this
you
said
he
as
i
came
near
to
him
speaking
thickly
and
getting
up
with
a
heavy
motion
i
now
recognized
the
altered
person
of
simon
slade
on
looking
at
him
closer
i
saw
that
the
eye
which
i
had
thought
only
shut
was
in
fact
destroyed
how
vividly
now
uprose
in
imagination
the
scenes
i
had
witnessed
during
my
last
night
in
his
the
night
when
a
brutal
mob
whom
he
had
inebriated
with
liquor
came
near
murdering
him
glad
to
see
you
once
more
my
boy
glad
to
see
you
i
i
i
not
just
you
see
how
are
you
how
are
you
and
he
shook
my
hand
with
a
drunken
show
of
cordiality
i
felt
shocked
and
disgusted
wretched
man
down
the
crumbling
sides
of
the
pit
he
had
digged
for
other
feet
he
was
himself
sliding
while
not
enough
strength
remained
even
to
struggle
with
his
fate
i
tried
for
a
few
minutes
to
talk
with
him
but
his
mind
was
altogether
beclouded
and
his
questions
and
answers
incoherent
so
i
left
him
and
entered
the
can
i
get
accommodations
here
for
a
couple
of
days
i
inquired
of
a
stupid
man
who
was
sitting
in
a
chair
behind
the
bar
i
reckon
so
he
answered
but
did
not
rise
i
turned
and
walked
a
few
paces
toward
the
door
and
then
walked
back
again
i
like
to
get
a
room
said
i
the
man
got
up
slowly
and
going
to
a
desk
fumbled
about
it
for
a
while
at
length
he
brought
out
an
old
dilapidated
and
throwing
it
open
on
the
counter
asked
me
with
an
indifferent
manner
to
write
down
my
name
i
take
a
pen
if
you
please
oh
yes
and
he
hunted
about
again
in
the
desk
from
which
after
a
while
he
brought
forth
the
blackened
stump
of
a
quill
and
pushed
it
toward
me
across
the
counter
ink
said
i
fixing
my
eyes
upon
him
with
a
look
of
displeasure
i
do
believe
there
is
any
he
muttered
frank
and
he
called
the
landlord
son
going
to
the
door
behind
the
bar
as
he
did
so
what
d
want
a
rough
voice
answered
where
the
ink
do
know
anything
about
it
you
had
it
last
what
did
you
do
with
it
nothing
was
growled
back
well
i
wish
you
find
it
find
it
yourself
and
i
can
not
repeat
the
profane
language
he
used
never
mind
said
i
a
pencil
will
do
just
as
well
and
i
drew
one
from
my
pocket
the
attempt
to
write
with
this
on
the
begrimed
and
greasy
page
of
the
register
was
only
partially
successful
it
would
have
puzzled
almost
any
one
to
make
out
the
name
from
the
date
of
the
last
entry
it
appeared
that
mine
was
the
first
arrival
for
over
a
week
of
any
person
desiring
a
room
as
i
finished
writing
my
name
frank
came
stalking
in
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
around
his
head
he
had
grown
into
a
stout
man
though
his
face
presented
little
that
was
manly
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
he
was
disgustingly
sensual
on
seeing
me
a
slight
flush
tinged
his
cheeks
how
do
you
do
he
said
offering
me
his
hand
peter
he
turned
to
the
tell
jane
to
have
no
put
in
order
for
a
gentleman
immediately
and
tell
her
to
be
sure
and
change
the
bed
linen
things
look
rather
dull
here
i
remarked
as
the
went
out
to
do
as
he
had
been
directed
rather
it
a
dull
place
anyhow
how
is
your
mother
i
inquired
a
slight
troubled
look
came
into
his
face
as
he
answered
no
better
she
sick
then
yes
she
been
sick
a
good
while
and
i
afraid
will
never
be
much
better
his
manner
was
not
altogether
cold
and
indifferent
but
there
was
a
want
of
feeling
in
his
voice
is
she
at
home
no
sir
as
he
showed
no
inclination
to
say
more
on
the
subject
i
asked
no
further
questions
and
he
soon
found
occasion
to
leave
me
the
bar
room
had
undergone
no
material
change
so
far
as
its
furniture
and
arrangements
were
concerned
but
a
very
great
change
was
apparent
in
the
condition
of
these
the
brass
rod
around
the
bar
which
at
my
last
visit
was
brightly
polished
was
now
a
and
there
came
from
it
an
unpleasant
odor
of
verdigris
the
walls
were
fairly
coated
with
dust
smoke
and
and
the
windows
let
in
the
light
but
feebly
through
the
glass
the
floor
was
filthy
behind
the
bar
on
the
shelves
designed
for
a
display
of
liquors
was
a
confused
mingling
of
empty
or
decanters
lemons
and
old
newspapers
glasses
a
broken
pitcher
a
hat
a
soiled
vest
and
a
pair
of
blacking
brushes
with
other
incongruous
things
not
now
remembered
the
air
of
the
room
was
loaded
with
offensive
vapors
disgusted
with
every
thing
about
the
bar
i
went
into
the
here
there
was
some
order
in
the
arrangement
of
the
dingy
furniture
but
you
might
have
written
your
name
in
dust
on
the
and
table
the
smell
of
the
torpid
atmosphere
was
even
worse
than
that
of
the
so
i
did
not
linger
here
but
passed
through
the
hall
and
out
upon
the
porch
to
get
a
draught
of
pure
air
slade
still
sat
leaning
against
the
wall
fine
day
this
said
he
speaking
in
a
mumbling
kind
of
voice
very
fine
i
answered
yes
very
fine
not
doing
so
well
as
you
were
a
few
years
ago
said
i
no
you
see
these
these
blamed
temperance
people
are
ruining
everything
ah
is
that
so
yes
cedarville
is
what
it
was
when
you
first
came
to
the
and
sheaf
i
i
you
see
curse
the
temperance
people
they
ruined
every
thing
you
see
every
thing
ruined
and
he
muttered
and
mouthed
his
words
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
understand
but
little
he
said
and
in
that
little
there
was
scarcely
any
coherency
so
i
left
him
with
a
feeling
of
pity
in
my
heart
for
the
wreck
he
had
become
and
went
into
the
town
to
call
upon
one
or
two
gentlemen
with
whom
i
had
business
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
i
learned
that
slade
was
in
an
insane
asylum
about
five
miles
from
cedarville
the
terrible
events
of
the
day
on
which
young
hammond
was
murdered
completed
the
work
of
mental
ruin
begun
at
the
time
her
husband
abandoned
the
quiet
honorable
calling
of
a
miller
and
became
a
reason
could
hold
its
position
no
longer
when
word
came
to
her
that
willy
and
his
mother
were
both
dead
she
uttered
a
wild
shriek
and
fell
down
in
a
fainting
fit
from
that
period
the
balance
of
her
mind
was
destroyed
long
before
this
her
friends
saw
that
reason
wavered
frank
had
been
her
idol
a
pure
bright
affectionate
boy
he
was
when
she
removed
with
him
from
their
pleasant
where
all
the
surrounding
influences
were
good
into
a
tavern
where
an
angel
could
scarcely
remain
without
corruption
from
the
moment
this
change
was
decided
on
by
her
husband
a
shadow
fell
upon
her
heart
she
saw
before
her
husband
her
children
and
herself
a
yawning
pit
and
felt
that
in
a
very
few
years
all
of
them
must
plunge
down
into
its
fearful
darkness
alas
how
quickly
began
the
realization
of
her
worst
fears
in
the
corruption
of
her
worshipped
boy
and
how
vain
proved
all
effort
and
remonstrance
looking
to
his
safety
whether
made
with
himself
or
his
father
from
the
day
the
tavern
was
opened
and
frank
drew
into
his
lungs
full
draughts
of
the
changed
atmosphere
by
which
he
was
now
surrounded
the
work
of
moral
deterioration
commenced
the
very
smell
of
the
liquor
exhilarated
him
unnaturally
while
the
subjects
of
conversation
so
new
to
him
that
found
discussion
in
the
soon
came
to
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
his
imagination
to
the
exclusion
of
those
humane
tender
and
heavenly
thoughts
and
impressions
it
had
been
the
mother
care
to
impart
and
awaken
ah
with
what
an
eager
zest
does
the
heart
drink
in
of
evil
and
how
almost
hopeless
is
the
case
of
a
boy
surrounded
as
frank
was
by
the
corrupting
debasing
associations
of
a
had
his
father
meditated
his
ruin
he
could
not
have
more
surely
laid
his
plans
for
the
fearful
consummation
and
he
reaped
as
he
had
sown
with
a
selfish
desire
to
get
gain
he
embarked
in
the
trade
of
corruption
ruin
and
death
weakly
believing
that
he
and
his
could
pass
through
the
fire
harmless
how
sadly
a
few
years
demonstrated
his
error
we
have
seen
flora
i
learned
was
with
her
mother
devoting
her
life
to
her
the
dreadful
death
of
willy
hammond
for
whom
she
had
conceived
a
strong
attachment
came
near
depriving
her
of
reason
also
since
the
day
on
which
that
awful
tragedy
occurred
she
had
never
even
looked
upon
her
old
home
she
went
away
with
her
unconscious
mother
and
ever
since
had
remained
with
her
devoting
her
life
to
her
comfort
long
before
this
all
her
own
and
mother
influence
over
her
brother
had
come
to
an
end
it
mattered
not
how
she
sought
to
stay
his
feet
so
swiftly
moving
along
the
downward
way
whether
by
gentle
entreaty
earnest
remonstrance
or
tears
in
either
case
wounds
for
her
own
heart
were
the
sure
consequences
while
his
steps
never
lingered
a
moment
a
swift
destiny
seemed
hurrying
him
on
to
ruin
the
change
in
her
father
once
so
tender
so
cheerful
in
his
tone
so
proud
of
and
loving
toward
his
daughter
was
another
source
of
deep
grief
to
her
pure
young
spirit
over
him
as
well
as
over
her
brother
all
her
power
was
lost
and
he
even
avoided
her
as
though
her
presence
were
an
offense
to
him
and
so
when
she
went
out
from
her
unhappy
home
she
took
with
her
no
desire
to
return
even
when
imagination
bore
her
back
to
the
sickle
and
sheaf
she
felt
an
intense
repulsion
toward
the
place
where
she
had
first
felt
the
poisoned
arrows
of
life
and
in
the
depths
of
her
spirit
she
prayed
that
her
eyes
might
never
look
upon
it
again
in
her
almost
seclusion
she
sought
to
gather
the
mantle
of
oblivion
about
her
heart
had
not
her
mother
condition
made
flora
duty
a
plain
one
the
true
unselfish
instincts
of
her
heart
would
have
doubtless
led
her
back
to
the
polluted
home
she
had
left
there
in
a
kind
of
living
death
to
minister
as
best
she
could
to
the
comfort
of
a
debased
father
and
brother
but
she
was
spared
that
trial
that
fruitless
sacrifice
evening
found
me
once
more
in
the
of
the
sickle
and
sheaf
the
sleepy
indifferent
was
now
more
in
his
element
looked
brighter
and
had
quicker
motions
slade
who
had
partially
recovered
from
the
stupefying
effects
of
the
heavy
draughts
of
ale
with
which
he
washed
down
his
dinner
was
also
in
a
better
condition
though
not
inclined
to
talk
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
alone
with
his
eyes
wandering
about
the
room
whether
his
thoughts
were
agreeable
or
disagreeable
it
was
not
easy
to
determine
frank
was
there
the
centre
of
a
noisy
group
of
coarse
fellows
whose
vulgar
sayings
and
profane
expletives
continually
rung
through
the
room
the
noisiest
coarsest
and
most
profane
was
frank
slade
yet
did
not
the
incessant
volume
of
bad
language
that
flowed
from
his
tongue
appear
in
the
least
to
disturb
his
father
outraged
at
length
by
this
disgusting
exhibition
that
had
not
even
the
excuse
of
an
exciting
cause
i
was
leaving
the
when
i
heard
some
one
remark
to
a
young
man
who
had
just
come
in
what
you
here
again
ned
ai
you
afraid
your
old
man
will
be
after
you
as
usual
no
answered
the
person
addressed
chuckling
inwardly
he
gone
to
a
you
at
least
have
the
benefit
of
his
prayers
was
lightly
remarked
i
turned
to
observe
the
young
man
more
closely
his
face
i
remembered
though
i
could
not
identify
him
at
first
but
when
i
heard
him
addressed
soon
after
as
ned
hargrove
i
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
a
little
incident
that
occurred
some
years
before
and
which
then
made
a
strong
impression
the
reader
has
hardly
forgotten
the
visit
of
hargrove
to
the
of
the
sickle
and
sheaf
and
the
conversation
among
some
of
its
inmates
which
his
withdrawal
in
company
with
his
son
then
occasioned
the
father
watchfulness
over
his
boy
and
his
efforts
to
save
him
from
the
allurements
and
temptations
of
a
had
proved
as
now
appeared
unavailing
the
son
was
several
years
older
but
it
was
sadly
evident
from
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
had
been
growing
older
in
evil
faster
than
in
years
the
few
words
that
i
have
mentioned
as
passing
between
this
young
man
and
another
inmate
of
the
caused
me
to
turn
back
from
the
door
through
which
i
was
about
passing
and
take
a
chair
near
to
where
hargrove
had
seated
himself
as
i
did
so
the
eyes
of
simon
slade
rested
on
the
individual
ned
hargrove
he
said
speaking
roughly
if
you
want
a
drink
better
get
it
and
make
yourself
scarce
do
trouble
yourself
retorted
the
young
man
you
get
your
money
for
the
drink
in
good
time
this
irritated
the
landlord
who
swore
at
hargrove
violently
and
said
something
about
not
wanting
boys
about
his
place
who
could
stir
from
home
without
having
daddy
or
mammy
running
after
them
never
fear
cried
out
the
person
who
had
first
addressed
hargrove
his
old
man
gone
to
a
we
sha
have
the
light
of
his
pious
countenance
here
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
young
man
to
see
what
effect
this
coarse
and
irreverent
allusion
to
his
father
would
have
a
slight
tinge
of
shame
was
in
his
face
but
i
saw
that
he
had
not
sufficient
moral
courage
to
resent
the
shameful
desecration
of
a
parent
name
how
should
he
when
he
was
himself
the
first
to
desecrate
that
name
if
he
were
forty
fathoms
deep
in
the
infernal
regions
answered
slade
he
find
out
that
ned
was
here
and
get
half
an
hour
leave
of
absence
to
come
after
him
the
fact
is
i
tired
of
seeing
his
solemn
sanctimonious
face
here
every
night
if
the
boy
has
spirit
enough
to
tell
him
to
mind
his
own
business
as
i
have
done
more
than
fifty
times
why
let
the
boy
stay
away
himself
why
do
you
send
him
off
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
ned
said
one
of
the
company
a
young
man
scarcely
his
own
age
my
old
man
tried
that
game
with
me
but
he
soon
found
that
i
could
hold
the
winning
cards
just
what
i
going
to
do
the
very
next
time
he
comes
after
me
oh
yes
so
you
said
twenty
times
remarked
frank
slade
in
a
sneering
insolent
manner
edward
hargrove
had
not
the
spirit
to
resent
this
he
only
answered
just
let
him
show
himself
here
and
you
will
see
no
we
wo
see
sneered
frank
would
it
be
fun
was
exclaimed
i
hope
to
be
on
hand
should
it
ever
come
off
he
as
as
death
of
the
old
chap
laughed
a
man
whose
age
ought
to
have
inspired
him
with
some
respect
for
the
relation
between
father
and
son
and
doubtless
would
had
not
a
long
course
of
drinking
and
familiarity
with
debasing
associates
blunted
his
moral
sense
now
for
it
i
heard
uttered
in
a
quick
delighted
voice
now
for
fun
spunk
up
to
him
ned
never
say
die
i
turned
toward
the
door
and
there
stood
the
father
of
edward
hargrove
how
well
i
remembered
the
broad
fine
forehead
the
steady
yet
mild
eyes
the
firm
lips
the
elevated
superior
bearing
of
the
man
i
had
once
before
seen
in
that
place
and
on
a
like
errand
his
form
was
slightly
bent
now
his
hair
was
whiter
his
eyes
farther
back
in
his
head
his
face
thinner
and
marked
with
deeper
lines
and
there
was
in
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
a
touching
sadness
yet
superior
to
the
marks
of
time
and
suffering
an
unflinching
resolution
was
visible
in
his
countenance
that
gave
to
it
a
dignity
and
extorted
involuntary
respect
he
stood
still
after
advancing
a
few
paces
and
then
his
searching
eyes
having
discovered
his
son
he
said
mildly
yet
firmly
and
with
such
a
strength
of
parental
love
in
his
voice
that
resistance
was
scarcely
possible
edward
edward
come
my
son
do
go
the
words
were
spoken
in
an
undertone
and
he
who
uttered
them
turned
his
face
away
from
hargrove
so
that
the
old
man
could
not
see
the
motion
of
his
lips
a
little
while
before
he
had
spoken
bravely
against
the
father
of
edward
now
he
could
not
stand
up
in
his
presence
i
looked
at
edward
he
did
not
move
from
where
he
was
sitting
and
yet
i
saw
that
to
resist
his
father
cost
him
no
light
struggle
edward
there
was
nothing
imperative
nothing
stern
nothing
commanding
in
the
father
voice
but
its
great
its
almost
irresistible
power
lay
in
its
expression
of
the
father
belief
that
his
son
would
instantly
leave
the
place
and
it
was
this
power
that
prevailed
edward
arose
and
with
eyes
cast
upon
the
floor
was
moving
away
from
his
companions
when
frank
slade
exclaimed
poor
weak
fool
it
was
a
lightning
flash
of
indignation
rather
than
a
mere
glance
from
the
human
eye
that
hargrove
threw
instantly
upon
frank
while
his
fine
form
sprung
up
erect
he
did
not
speak
but
merely
transfixed
him
with
a
look
frank
curled
his
lip
impotently
as
he
tried
to
return
the
old
man
withering
glances
now
look
here
said
simon
slade
in
some
wrath
there
been
just
about
enough
of
this
i
getting
tired
of
it
why
do
you
keep
ned
at
home
nobody
wants
him
here
refuse
to
sell
him
liquor
returned
hargrove
it
my
trade
to
sell
liquor
answered
slade
boldly
i
wish
you
had
a
more
honorable
calling
said
hargrove
almost
mournfully
if
you
insult
my
father
i
strike
you
down
exclaimed
frank
slade
starting
up
and
assuming
a
threatening
aspect
i
respect
filial
devotion
meet
it
where
i
will
calmly
replied
hargrove
i
only
wish
it
had
a
better
foundation
in
this
case
i
only
wish
the
father
had
merited
i
will
not
stain
my
page
with
the
fearful
oath
that
frank
slade
yelled
rather
than
uttered
as
with
clenched
fist
he
sprung
toward
hargrove
but
ere
he
had
reached
the
unruffled
old
man
who
stood
looking
at
him
as
one
would
look
into
the
eyes
of
a
wild
beast
confident
that
he
could
not
stand
the
gaze
a
firm
hand
grasped
his
arm
and
a
rough
voice
said
avast
there
young
man
touch
a
hair
of
that
white
head
and
wring
your
neck
off
lyon
as
frank
uttered
the
man
name
he
raised
his
fist
to
strike
him
a
moment
the
clenched
hand
remained
poised
in
the
air
then
it
fell
slowly
to
his
side
and
he
contented
himself
with
an
oath
and
a
vile
epithet
you
can
swear
to
your
heart
content
it
will
do
nobody
any
harm
but
yourself
coolly
replied
lyon
whom
i
now
recognized
as
the
person
with
whom
i
had
held
several
conversations
during
previous
visits
thank
you
lyon
said
hargrove
for
this
manly
interference
it
is
no
more
than
i
should
have
expected
from
you
i
never
suffer
a
young
man
to
strike
an
old
man
said
lyon
firmly
apart
from
that
hargrove
there
are
other
reasons
why
your
person
must
be
free
from
violence
where
i
am
this
is
a
bad
place
for
you
lyon
said
hargrove
and
i
said
so
to
you
a
good
many
times
he
spoke
in
rattier
an
undertone
why
will
you
come
here
it
a
bad
place
i
know
replied
lyon
speaking
out
boldly
and
we
all
know
it
but
habit
hargrove
habit
that
the
cursed
thing
if
the
were
all
shut
up
there
would
be
another
story
to
tell
get
us
the
maine
law
and
there
will
be
some
chance
for
us
why
do
you
vote
the
temperance
ticket
asked
hargrove
why
did
i
you
better
ask
said
lyon
i
thought
you
voted
against
us
not
i
ai
quite
so
blind
to
my
own
interest
as
that
and
if
the
truth
were
known
i
should
not
at
all
wonder
if
every
man
in
this
room
except
slade
and
his
son
voted
on
your
side
of
the
house
it
a
little
strange
then
said
hargrove
that
with
the
drinking
men
on
our
side
we
failed
to
secure
the
election
you
must
blame
that
on
your
moderate
men
who
see
no
danger
and
go
blind
with
their
party
answered
lyon
we
have
looked
the
evil
in
the
face
and
know
its
direful
quality
come
i
would
like
to
talk
with
you
mr
lyon
hargrove
his
son
and
lyon
went
out
together
as
they
left
the
room
frank
slade
said
what
a
cursed
liar
and
hypocrite
he
is
who
was
asked
why
lyon
answered
frank
boldly
you
better
say
that
to
his
face
it
would
be
good
for
him
remarked
one
of
the
company
at
this
frank
started
to
his
feet
stalked
about
the
room
and
put
on
all
the
disgusting
airs
of
a
drunken
braggart
even
his
father
saw
the
ridiculous
figure
he
cut
and
growled
out
there
frank
that
do
do
make
a
miserable
fool
of
yourself
at
which
frank
retorted
with
so
much
of
insolence
that
his
father
flew
into
a
towering
passion
and
ordered
him
to
leave
the
you
can
go
out
yourself
if
you
do
like
the
company
i
very
well
satisfied
answered
frank
leave
this
room
you
impudent
young
scoundrel
ca
go
my
amiable
friend
said
frank
with
a
cool
that
maddened
his
father
who
got
up
hastily
and
moved
across
the
to
the
place
where
he
was
standing
go
out
i
tell
you
slade
spoke
resolutely
would
be
happy
to
oblige
you
frank
said
in
a
taunting
voice
but
my
word
it
is
at
all
convenient
half
intoxicated
as
he
was
and
already
nearly
blind
with
passion
slade
lifted
his
hand
to
strike
his
son
and
the
blow
would
have
fallen
had
not
some
one
caught
his
arm
and
held
him
back
from
the
meditated
violence
even
the
debased
visitors
of
this
could
not
stand
by
and
see
nature
outraged
in
a
bloody
strife
between
father
and
son
for
it
was
plain
from
the
face
and
quickly
assumed
attitude
of
frank
that
if
his
father
had
laid
his
hand
upon
him
he
would
have
struck
him
in
return
i
could
not
remain
to
hear
the
awful
imprecations
that
father
and
son
in
their
impotent
rage
called
down
from
heaven
upon
each
heads
it
was
the
most
shocking
exhibition
of
depraved
human
nature
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
so
i
left
the
glad
to
escape
from
its
stifling
atmosphere
and
revolting
scenes
night
the
ninth
a
fearful
consummation
neither
slade
nor
his
son
was
present
at
the
on
the
next
morning
as
for
myself
i
did
not
eat
with
much
appetite
whether
this
defect
arose
from
the
state
of
my
mind
or
the
state
of
the
food
set
before
me
i
did
not
stop
to
inquire
but
left
the
stifling
offensive
atmosphere
of
the
in
a
very
few
moments
after
entering
that
usually
attractive
place
for
a
hungry
man
a
few
early
drinkers
were
already
in
the
men
with
shattered
nerves
and
cadaverous
faces
who
could
not
begin
the
day
work
without
the
stimulus
of
brandy
or
whisky
they
came
in
with
gliding
footsteps
asked
for
what
they
wanted
in
low
voices
drank
in
silence
and
departed
it
was
a
melancholy
sight
to
look
upon
about
nine
the
landlord
made
his
appearance
he
too
came
gliding
into
the
and
his
first
act
was
to
seize
upon
a
brandy
decanter
pour
out
nearly
half
a
pint
of
the
fiery
liquid
and
drink
it
off
how
badly
his
hand
shook
so
badly
that
he
spilled
the
brandy
both
in
pouring
it
out
and
in
lifting
the
glass
to
his
lips
what
a
shattered
wreck
he
was
he
looked
really
worse
now
than
he
did
on
the
day
before
when
drink
gave
an
artificial
vitality
to
his
system
a
tension
to
his
muscles
and
light
to
his
countenance
the
miller
of
ten
years
ago
and
the
of
today
who
could
have
identified
them
as
one
slade
was
turning
from
the
bar
when
a
man
came
in
i
noticed
an
instant
change
in
the
landlord
countenance
he
looked
startled
almost
frightened
the
man
drew
a
small
package
from
his
pocket
and
after
selecting
a
paper
therefrom
presented
it
to
slade
who
received
it
with
a
nervous
reluctance
opened
and
let
his
eye
fall
upon
the
writing
within
i
was
observing
him
closely
at
the
time
and
saw
his
countenance
flush
deeply
in
a
moment
or
two
it
became
pale
again
paler
even
than
before
very
well
all
right
i
attend
to
it
said
the
landlord
trying
to
recover
himself
yet
swallowing
with
every
sentence
the
man
who
was
no
other
than
a
sheriff
deputy
and
who
gave
him
a
sober
professional
look
then
went
out
with
a
firm
step
and
an
air
of
importance
as
he
passed
through
the
outer
door
slade
retired
from
the
trouble
coming
i
heard
the
remark
speaking
partly
to
himself
and
partly
with
the
view
as
was
evident
from
his
manner
of
leading
me
to
question
him
but
this
i
did
not
feel
that
it
was
right
to
do
got
the
sheriff
on
him
at
last
added
the
what
the
matter
bill
inquired
a
man
who
now
came
in
with
a
bustling
important
air
and
leaned
familiarly
over
the
bar
who
was
jenkins
after
the
old
man
replied
the
in
a
voice
that
showed
pleasure
rather
than
regret
no
it
a
fact
bill
the
actually
smiled
what
to
pay
said
the
man
do
know
and
do
care
much
did
he
serve
a
summons
or
an
execution
ca
tell
judge
lyman
suit
went
against
him
did
it
yes
and
i
heard
judge
lyman
swear
that
if
he
got
him
on
the
hip
he
sell
him
out
bag
and
basket
and
he
the
man
to
keep
his
word
i
never
could
just
make
out
said
the
how
he
ever
came
to
owe
judge
lyman
so
much
i
never
known
of
any
business
transactions
between
them
it
been
dog
eat
dog
i
rather
guess
said
the
man
what
do
you
mean
by
that
inquired
the
you
heard
of
dogs
hunting
in
pairs
oh
yes
well
since
harvey
green
got
his
deserts
the
business
of
fleecing
our
silly
young
fellows
who
happened
to
have
more
money
than
wit
or
discretion
has
been
in
the
hands
of
judge
lyman
and
slade
they
hunted
together
slade
holding
the
game
while
the
judge
acted
as
but
that
business
was
interrupted
about
a
year
ago
and
game
got
so
scarce
that
as
i
suggested
dog
began
to
eat
dog
and
here
comes
the
end
of
the
matter
if
i
not
mistaken
so
mix
us
a
stiff
toddy
i
want
one
more
good
drink
at
the
and
sheaf
before
the
colors
are
struck
and
the
man
chuckled
at
his
witty
effort
during
the
day
i
learned
that
affairs
stood
pretty
much
as
this
man
had
conjectured
lyman
suits
had
been
on
sundry
notes
payable
on
demand
but
nobody
knew
of
any
property
transactions
between
him
and
slade
on
the
part
of
slade
no
defense
had
been
made
the
suit
going
by
default
the
visit
of
the
sheriff
officer
was
for
the
purpose
of
serving
an
execution
as
i
walked
through
cedarville
on
that
day
the
whole
aspect
of
the
place
seemed
changed
i
questioned
with
myself
often
whether
this
were
really
so
or
only
the
effect
of
imagination
the
change
was
from
cheerfulness
and
thrift
to
gloom
and
neglect
there
was
to
me
a
brooding
silence
in
the
air
a
pause
in
the
a
folding
of
the
hands
so
to
speak
because
hope
had
failed
from
the
heart
the
residence
of
harrison
who
some
two
years
before
had
suddenly
awakened
to
a
lively
sense
of
the
evil
of
because
his
own
sons
were
discovered
to
be
in
danger
had
been
one
of
the
most
tasteful
in
cedarville
i
had
often
stopped
to
admire
the
beautiful
shrubbery
and
flowers
with
which
it
was
surrounded
the
walks
so
clear
the
borders
so
fresh
and
even
the
arbors
so
cool
and
inviting
there
was
not
a
spot
upon
which
the
eye
could
rest
that
did
not
show
the
hand
of
taste
when
i
now
came
opposite
to
this
house
i
was
not
longer
in
doubt
as
to
the
actuality
of
a
change
there
were
no
marked
evidences
of
neglect
but
the
high
cultivation
and
nice
regard
for
the
small
details
were
lacking
the
walks
were
cleanly
swept
but
the
were
not
so
carefully
trimmed
the
vines
and
bushes
that
in
former
times
were
cut
and
tied
so
evenly
could
hardly
have
felt
the
keen
touch
of
the
for
months
as
i
paused
to
note
the
change
a
lady
somewhat
beyond
the
middle
age
came
from
the
house
i
was
struck
by
the
deep
gloom
that
overshadowed
her
countenance
ah
said
i
to
myself
as
i
passed
on
how
many
dear
hopes
that
once
lived
in
that
heart
must
have
been
scattered
to
the
winds
as
i
conjectured
this
was
harrison
and
i
was
not
unprepared
to
hear
as
i
did
a
few
hours
afterward
that
her
two
sons
had
fallen
into
drinking
habits
and
not
only
this
had
been
enticed
to
the
unhappy
mother
what
a
of
wretchedness
was
compressed
for
thee
into
a
few
short
years
i
walked
on
noting
here
and
there
changes
even
more
marked
than
appeared
about
the
residence
of
harrison
judge
lyman
beautiful
place
showed
utter
neglect
and
so
did
one
or
two
others
that
on
my
first
visit
to
cedarville
charmed
me
with
their
order
neatness
and
cultivation
in
every
instance
i
learned
on
inquiring
that
the
owners
of
these
or
some
members
of
their
families
were
or
had
been
visitors
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
and
that
the
ruin
in
progress
or
completed
began
after
the
establishment
of
that
point
of
attraction
in
the
village
something
of
a
morbid
curiosity
excited
by
what
i
saw
led
me
on
to
take
a
closer
view
of
the
residence
of
judge
hammond
than
i
had
obtained
on
the
day
before
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
on
approaching
the
old
decaying
mansion
were
handbills
posted
on
the
gate
the
and
on
one
of
the
windows
a
nearer
inspection
revealed
their
import
the
property
had
been
seized
and
was
now
offered
at
sheriff
sale
ten
years
before
judge
hammond
was
known
as
the
richest
man
in
cedarville
and
now
the
homestead
which
he
had
once
so
loved
to
beautify
where
all
that
was
dearest
to
him
in
life
once
gathered
worn
disfigured
and
in
ruins
was
about
to
be
wrested
from
him
i
paused
at
the
gate
and
leaning
over
it
looked
in
with
saddened
feelings
upon
the
dreary
waste
within
no
sign
of
life
was
visible
the
door
was
shut
the
windows
closed
not
the
faintest
wreath
of
smoke
was
seen
above
the
blackened
how
vividly
did
imagination
restore
the
life
and
beauty
and
happiness
that
made
their
home
there
only
a
few
years
before
the
mother
and
her
noble
boy
one
looking
with
trembling
hope
the
other
with
joyous
confidence
into
the
future
the
father
proud
of
his
household
treasures
but
not
their
wise
and
jealous
guardian
ah
that
his
hands
should
have
unbarred
the
door
and
thrown
it
wide
for
the
wolf
to
enter
that
precious
fold
i
saw
them
all
in
their
sunny
life
before
me
yet
even
as
i
looked
upon
them
their
sky
began
to
darken
i
heard
the
distant
mutterings
of
the
storm
and
soon
the
desolating
tempest
swept
down
fearfully
upon
them
i
shuddered
as
it
passed
away
to
look
upon
the
wrecks
left
scattered
around
what
a
change
and
all
this
said
i
that
one
man
tired
of
being
useful
and
eager
to
get
gain
might
gather
in
accursed
gold
pushing
open
the
gate
i
entered
the
yard
and
walked
around
the
dwelling
my
footsteps
echoing
in
the
hushed
solitude
of
the
deserted
place
hark
was
that
a
human
voice
i
paused
to
listen
the
sound
came
once
more
distinctly
to
my
ears
i
looked
around
above
everywhere
but
perceived
no
living
sign
for
nearly
a
minute
i
stood
still
listening
yes
there
it
was
again
a
low
moaning
voice
as
of
one
in
pain
or
grief
i
stepped
onward
a
few
paces
and
now
saw
one
of
the
doors
standing
ajar
as
i
pushed
this
door
wide
open
the
moan
was
repeated
following
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
i
entered
one
of
the
large
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
and
all
as
dark
as
if
it
were
midnight
groping
my
way
to
a
window
i
drew
back
the
bolt
and
threw
open
the
shutter
broadly
the
light
fell
across
the
dusty
uncarpeted
floor
and
on
the
dingy
furniture
of
the
room
as
it
did
so
the
moaning
voice
which
had
drawn
me
thither
swelled
on
the
air
again
and
now
i
saw
lying
upon
an
old
sofa
the
form
of
a
man
it
needed
no
second
glance
to
tell
me
that
this
was
judge
hammond
i
put
my
hand
upon
him
and
uttered
his
name
but
he
answered
not
i
spoke
more
firmly
and
slightly
shook
him
but
only
a
piteous
moan
was
returned
judge
hammond
i
now
called
aloud
and
somewhat
imperatively
but
it
availed
nothing
the
poor
old
man
aroused
not
from
the
stupor
in
which
mind
and
body
were
enshrouded
he
is
dying
thought
i
and
instantly
left
the
house
in
search
of
some
friends
to
take
charge
of
him
in
his
last
sad
extremity
the
first
person
to
whom
i
made
known
the
fact
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
it
was
no
affair
of
his
and
that
i
must
find
somebody
whose
business
it
was
to
attend
to
him
my
next
application
was
met
in
the
same
spirit
and
no
better
success
attended
my
reference
of
the
matter
to
a
third
party
no
one
to
whom
i
spoke
seemed
to
have
any
sympathy
for
the
old
man
shocked
by
this
indifference
i
went
to
one
of
the
county
officers
who
on
learning
the
condition
of
judge
hammond
took
immediate
steps
to
have
him
removed
to
the
some
miles
distant
but
why
to
the
i
inquired
on
learning
his
purpose
he
has
property
everything
has
been
seized
for
debt
was
the
reply
will
there
be
nothing
left
after
his
creditors
are
satisfied
very
few
if
any
will
be
satisfied
he
answered
there
will
not
be
enough
to
pay
half
the
judgments
against
him
and
is
there
no
friend
to
take
him
in
no
one
of
all
who
moved
by
his
side
in
the
days
of
prosperity
to
give
a
few
hours
shelter
and
soothe
the
last
moments
of
his
unhappy
life
why
did
you
make
application
here
was
the
officer
significant
question
i
was
silent
your
earnest
appeals
for
the
poor
old
man
met
with
no
words
of
sympathy
none
he
has
indeed
fallen
low
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
he
had
many
friends
so
called
adversity
has
shaken
them
all
like
dead
leaves
from
sapless
branches
but
why
this
is
not
always
so
judge
hammond
was
a
selfish
worldly
man
people
never
liked
him
much
his
favoring
so
strongly
the
tavern
of
slade
and
his
distillery
operations
turned
from
him
some
of
his
best
friends
the
corruption
and
terrible
fate
of
his
son
and
the
insanity
and
death
of
his
wife
all
were
charged
upon
him
in
people
minds
and
every
one
seemed
to
turn
from
him
instinctively
after
the
fearful
tragedy
was
completed
he
never
held
tip
his
head
afterward
neighbors
shunned
him
as
they
would
a
criminal
and
here
has
come
the
end
at
last
he
will
be
taken
to
the
poorhouse
to
die
there
a
pauper
and
all
said
i
partly
speaking
to
myself
because
a
man
too
lazy
to
work
at
an
honest
calling
must
needs
go
to
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
remarked
the
officer
with
emphasis
as
he
turned
from
me
to
see
that
his
directions
touching
the
removal
of
hammond
to
the
were
promptly
executed
in
my
wanderings
about
cedarville
during
that
day
i
noticed
a
small
but
very
neat
cottage
a
little
way
from
the
centre
of
the
village
there
was
not
around
it
a
great
profusion
of
flowers
and
shrubbery
but
the
few
vines
flowers
and
bushes
that
grew
green
and
flourishing
about
the
door
and
along
the
clean
walks
added
to
the
air
of
taste
and
comfort
that
so
peculiarly
marked
the
dwelling
who
lives
in
that
pleasant
little
spot
i
asked
of
a
man
whom
i
had
frequently
seen
in
blade
he
happened
to
be
passing
the
house
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
joe
morgan
was
answered
indeed
i
spoke
in
some
surprise
and
what
of
morgan
how
is
he
doing
very
well
does
he
drink
no
since
the
death
of
his
child
he
has
never
taken
a
drop
that
event
sobered
him
and
he
has
remained
sober
ever
since
what
is
he
doing
working
at
his
old
trade
that
of
a
miller
yes
after
judge
hammond
broke
down
the
distillery
apparatus
and
cotton
spinning
machinery
were
all
sold
and
removed
from
cedarville
the
purchaser
of
what
remained
having
something
of
the
fear
of
god
as
well
as
regard
for
man
in
his
heart
set
himself
to
the
restoration
of
the
old
order
of
things
and
in
due
time
the
revolving
was
at
its
old
and
better
work
of
grinding
corn
and
wheat
for
bread
the
only
two
men
in
cedarville
competent
to
take
charge
of
the
mill
were
simon
slade
and
joe
morgan
the
first
could
not
be
had
and
the
second
came
in
as
a
matter
of
course
and
he
remains
sober
and
industrious
as
any
man
in
the
village
was
the
answer
i
saw
but
little
of
slade
or
his
son
during
the
day
but
both
were
in
the
at
night
and
both
in
a
condition
sorrowful
to
look
upon
their
presence
together
in
the
half
intoxicated
as
they
were
seemed
to
revive
the
unhappy
temper
of
the
previous
evening
as
freshly
as
if
the
sun
had
not
risen
and
set
upon
their
anger
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
considerable
company
was
present
though
not
of
a
very
select
class
a
large
proportion
were
young
men
to
most
of
them
the
fact
that
slade
had
fallen
into
the
sheriff
hands
was
known
and
i
gathered
from
some
aside
conversation
which
reached
my
ears
that
frank
idle
spendthrift
habits
had
hastened
the
present
crisis
in
his
father
affairs
he
too
was
in
debt
to
judge
lyman
on
what
account
it
was
not
hard
to
infer
it
was
after
nine
and
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
persons
in
the
room
when
i
noticed
frank
slade
go
behind
the
bar
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
he
was
just
lifting
a
decanter
of
brandy
when
his
father
who
was
considerably
under
the
influence
of
drink
started
forward
and
laid
his
hand
upon
that
of
his
son
instantly
a
fierce
light
gleamed
from
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
let
go
of
my
hand
he
exclaimed
no
i
wo
put
up
that
brandy
bottle
you
drunk
now
do
meddle
with
me
old
man
angrily
retorted
frank
i
not
in
the
mood
to
bear
anything
more
from
you
you
drunk
as
a
fool
now
returned
slade
who
had
seized
the
decanter
let
go
the
bottle
for
only
an
instant
did
the
young
man
hesitate
then
he
drove
his
hand
against
the
breast
of
his
father
who
went
staggering
several
paces
from
the
counter
recovering
himself
and
now
almost
furious
the
landlord
rushed
forward
upon
his
son
his
hand
raised
to
strike
him
keep
off
cried
frank
keep
off
if
you
touch
me
i
strike
you
down
at
the
same
time
raising
the
bottle
threateningly
but
his
father
was
in
too
maddened
a
state
to
fear
any
consequences
and
so
pressed
forward
upon
his
son
striking
him
in
the
face
the
moment
he
came
near
enough
to
do
so
instantly
the
young
man
infuriated
by
drink
and
evil
passions
threw
the
bottle
at
his
father
head
the
dangerous
missile
fell
crashing
upon
one
of
his
temples
shivering
it
into
a
hundred
pieces
a
heavy
jarring
fall
too
surely
marked
the
fearful
consequences
of
the
blow
when
we
gathered
around
the
fallen
man
and
made
an
effort
to
lift
him
from
the
floor
a
thrill
of
horror
went
through
every
heart
a
mortal
paleness
was
already
on
his
marred
face
and
the
in
his
throat
in
three
minutes
from
the
time
the
blow
was
struck
his
spirit
had
gone
upward
to
give
an
account
of
the
deeds
done
in
the
body
frank
slade
you
have
murdered
your
father
sternly
were
these
terrible
words
uttered
it
was
some
time
before
the
young
man
seemed
to
comprehend
their
meaning
but
the
moment
he
realized
the
awful
truth
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
horror
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
came
sharply
on
the
ear
but
the
meditated
was
not
accomplished
the
aim
was
not
surely
taken
and
the
ball
struck
harmlessly
against
the
ceiling
half
an
hour
afterward
and
frank
slade
was
a
lonely
prisoner
in
the
county
jail
does
the
reader
need
a
word
of
comment
on
this
fearful
consummation
no
and
we
will
offer
none
night
the
tenth
the
closing
scene
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
on
the
day
that
succeeded
the
evening
of
this
fearful
tragedy
placards
were
to
be
seen
all
over
the
village
announcing
a
mass
meeting
at
the
sickle
and
sheaf
that
night
by
early
twilight
the
people
commenced
assembling
the
bar
which
had
been
closed
all
day
was
now
thrown
open
and
lighted
and
in
this
room
where
so
much
of
evil
had
been
originated
encouraged
and
consummated
a
crowd
of
men
were
soon
gathered
among
them
i
saw
the
fine
person
of
hargrove
joe
morgan
or
rather
morgan
was
also
one
of
the
number
the
latter
i
would
scarcely
have
recognized
had
not
some
one
near
me
called
him
by
name
he
was
well
dressed
stood
erect
and
though
there
were
many
deep
lines
on
his
thoughtful
countenance
all
traces
of
his
former
habits
were
gone
while
i
was
observing
him
he
arose
and
addressing
a
few
words
to
the
assemblage
nominated
hargrove
as
chairman
of
the
meeting
to
this
a
unanimous
assent
was
given
on
taking
the
chair
hargrove
made
a
brief
address
something
to
this
effect
ten
years
ago
said
he
his
voice
evincing
a
slight
unsteadiness
as
he
began
but
growing
firmer
as
he
proceeded
there
was
not
a
happier
spot
in
bolton
county
than
cedarville
now
the
marks
of
ruin
are
everywhere
ten
years
ago
there
was
a
industrious
miller
in
cedarville
liked
by
every
one
and
as
harmless
as
a
little
child
now
his
bloated
disfigured
body
lies
in
that
room
his
death
was
violent
and
by
the
hand
of
his
own
son
hargrove
words
fell
slowly
distinctly
and
marked
by
the
most
forcible
emphasis
there
was
scarcely
one
present
who
did
not
feel
a
low
shudder
run
along
his
nerves
as
the
last
words
were
spoken
in
a
husky
whisper
ten
years
ago
he
proceeded
the
miller
had
a
happy
wife
and
two
innocent
children
now
his
wife
bereft
of
reason
is
in
a
and
his
son
the
occupant
of
a
felon
cell
charged
with
the
awful
crime
of
parricide
briefly
he
paused
while
his
audience
stood
gazing
upon
him
with
respiration
ten
years
ago
he
went
on
judge
hammond
was
accounted
the
richest
man
in
cedarville
yesterday
he
was
carried
a
friendless
pauper
to
the
and
he
is
the
unmourned
occupant
of
a
grave
ten
years
ago
his
wife
was
the
proud
hopeful
loving
mother
of
a
most
promising
son
i
need
not
describe
what
willy
hammond
was
all
here
knew
him
well
ah
what
shattered
the
fine
intellect
of
that
woman
why
did
her
heart
break
where
is
she
where
is
willy
hammond
a
low
groan
answered
the
speaker
ten
years
ago
you
sir
pointing
to
a
old
man
and
calling
him
by
name
had
two
sons
generous
promising
boys
what
are
they
now
you
need
not
answer
the
question
too
well
is
their
history
and
your
sorrow
known
ten
years
ago
i
had
a
son
amiable
kind
loving
but
weak
heaven
knows
how
i
sought
to
guard
and
protect
him
but
he
fell
also
the
arrows
of
destruction
darkened
the
very
air
of
our
once
secure
and
happy
village
and
who
is
safe
not
mine
nor
yours
shall
i
go
on
shall
i
call
up
and
pass
in
review
before
you
one
after
another
all
the
wretched
victims
who
have
fallen
in
cedarville
during
the
last
ten
years
time
does
not
permit
it
would
take
hours
for
the
enumeration
no
i
will
not
throw
additional
darkness
into
the
picture
heaven
knows
it
is
black
enough
already
but
what
is
the
root
of
this
great
evil
where
lies
the
fearful
secret
who
understands
the
disease
a
direful
pestilence
is
in
the
air
it
walketh
in
darkness
and
wasteth
at
noonday
it
is
slaying
the
in
our
houses
and
the
cry
of
anguish
is
swelling
on
every
gale
is
there
no
remedy
yes
yes
there
is
a
remedy
was
the
spontaneous
answer
from
many
voices
be
it
our
task
then
to
find
and
apply
it
this
night
answered
the
chairman
as
he
took
his
seat
and
there
is
but
one
remedy
said
morgan
as
hargrove
sat
down
the
accursed
traffic
must
cease
among
us
you
must
cut
off
the
fountain
if
you
would
dry
up
the
stream
if
you
would
save
the
young
the
weak
and
the
innocent
on
you
god
has
laid
the
solemn
duty
of
their
protection
you
must
cover
them
from
the
tempter
evil
is
strong
wily
fierce
and
active
in
the
pursuit
of
its
ends
the
young
the
weak
and
the
innocent
can
no
more
resist
its
assaults
than
the
lamb
can
resist
the
wolf
they
are
helpless
if
you
abandon
them
to
the
powers
of
evil
men
and
brethren
as
one
who
has
himself
been
lost
as
one
who
daily
feels
and
trembles
at
the
dangers
that
beset
his
path
i
do
conjure
you
to
stay
the
fiery
stream
that
is
bearing
every
thing
good
and
beautiful
among
you
to
destruction
fathers
for
the
sake
of
your
young
children
be
up
now
and
doing
think
of
willy
hammond
frank
slade
and
a
dozen
more
whose
names
i
could
repeat
and
hesitate
no
longer
let
us
resolve
this
night
that
from
henceforth
the
traffic
shall
cease
in
cedarville
is
there
not
a
large
majority
of
citizens
in
favor
of
such
a
measure
and
whose
rights
or
interests
can
be
affected
by
such
a
restriction
who
in
fact
has
any
right
to
sow
disease
and
death
in
our
community
the
liberty
under
sufferance
to
do
so
wrongs
the
individual
who
uses
it
as
well
as
those
who
become
his
victims
do
you
want
proof
of
this
look
at
simon
slade
the
happy
miller
and
at
simon
slade
the
was
he
benefited
by
the
liberty
to
work
harm
to
his
neighbor
no
no
in
heaven
name
then
let
the
traffic
cease
to
this
end
i
offer
these
resolutions
be
it
resolved
by
the
inhabitants
of
cedarville
that
from
this
day
henceforth
no
more
intoxicating
drink
shall
be
sold
within
the
limits
of
the
corporation
resolved
further
that
all
the
liquors
in
the
and
sheaf
be
forthwith
destroyed
and
that
a
fund
be
raised
to
pay
the
creditors
of
simon
slade
therefor
should
they
demand
compensation
resolved
that
in
closing
up
all
other
places
where
liquor
is
sold
regard
shall
be
had
to
the
right
of
property
which
the
law
secures
to
every
man
resolved
that
with
the
consent
of
the
legal
authorities
all
the
liquor
for
sale
in
cedarville
be
destroyed
provided
the
owners
thereof
be
paid
its
full
value
out
of
a
fund
specially
raised
for
that
purpose
but
for
the
calm
yet
resolute
opposition
of
one
or
two
men
these
resolutions
would
have
passed
by
acclamation
a
little
sober
argument
showed
the
excited
company
that
no
good
end
is
ever
secured
by
the
adoption
of
wrong
means
there
were
in
cedarville
regularly
constituted
authorities
which
alone
had
the
power
to
determine
public
measures
or
to
say
what
business
might
or
might
not
be
pursued
by
individuals
and
through
these
authorities
they
must
act
in
an
orderly
way
there
was
some
little
chafing
at
this
view
of
the
case
but
good
sense
and
reason
prevailed
somewhat
modified
the
resolutions
passed
and
the
more
contented
themselves
with
carrying
out
the
second
resolution
to
destroy
forthwith
all
the
liquor
to
be
found
on
the
premises
which
was
immediately
done
after
which
the
people
dispersed
to
their
homes
each
with
a
lighter
heart
and
better
hopes
for
the
future
of
their
village
on
the
next
day
as
i
entered
the
stage
that
was
to
bear
me
from
cedarville
i
saw
a
man
strike
his
sharp
axe
into
the
worn
faded
and
leaning
post
that
had
for
so
many
years
borne
aloft
the
sickle
and
sheaf
and
just
as
the
driver
gave
word
to
his
horses
the
false
emblem
which
had
invited
so
many
to
enter
the
way
of
destruction
fell
crashing
to
the
earth
the
end
