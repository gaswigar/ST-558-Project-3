s
apology
the
maker
of
these
stories
has
been
told
that
he
must
not
bring
them
to
you
himself
he
has
asked
me
to
pretend
that
i
am
the
author
i
am
an
old
little
irish
spirit
and
i
sit
in
the
hedges
and
watch
the
world
go
by
i
see
the
boys
going
to
market
driving
donkeys
with
creels
of
turf
and
the
girls
carrying
baskets
of
apples
sometimes
i
call
to
some
pretty
face
and
we
chat
a
little
in
the
shadow
the
apple
basket
before
us
for
as
my
faithful
historian
o
kearney
has
put
it
in
his
now
yellow
manuscript
i
care
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
love
and
idleness
will
not
you
too
sit
down
under
the
shade
of
the
bushes
while
i
read
you
the
stories
the
first
i
do
not
care
for
because
it
deals
with
dull
persons
and
the
world
s
affairs
but
the
second
has
to
do
with
my
own
people
if
my
voice
at
whiles
grows
distant
and
dreamy
when
i
talk
of
the
world
s
affairs
remember
that
i
have
seen
all
from
my
hole
in
the
hedge
i
hear
continually
the
songs
of
my
own
people
who
dance
upon
the
and
am
content
i
have
never
carried
apples
or
driven
turf
myself
or
if
i
did
it
was
only
in
a
dream
nor
do
my
kind
use
any
of
man
s
belongings
except
the
little
black
pipes
which
the
farmers
find
now
and
then
when
they
are
turning
the
sods
over
with
a
plough
ganconagh

sherman
leaves
i
in
the
west
of
ireland
on
the
of
december
in
the
town
of
ballah
in
the
imperial
hotel
there
was
a
single
guest
clerical
and
youthful
with
the
exception
of
a
stray
commercial
traveller
who
stopped
once
for
a
night
there
had
been
nobody
for
a
whole
month
but
this
guest
and
now
he
was
thinking
of
going
away
the
town
full
enough
in
summer
of
trout
and
salmon
fishers
slept
all
winter
like
the
bears
on
the
evening
of
the
of
december
in
the
of
the
imperial
hotel
there
was
nobody
but
this
guest
the
guest
was
irritated
it
had
rained
all
day
and
now
that
it
was
clearing
up
night
had
almost
fallen
he
had
packed
his
portmanteau
his
stockings
his
his
razor
his
dress
shoes
were
each
in
their
corner
and
now
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
had
tried
the
paper
that
was
lying
on
the
table
he
did
not
agree
with
its
politics
the
waiter
was
playing
an
accordion
in
a
little
room
over
the
stairs
the
guest
s
irritation
increased
for
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
perceived
that
the
accordion
was
badly
played
there
was
a
piano
in
the
he
sat
down
at
it
and
played
the
tune
correctly
as
loudly
as
possible
the
waiter
took
no
notice
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
being
played
for
he
was
wholly
absorbed
in
his
own
playing
and
besides
he
was
old
obstinate
and
deaf
the
guest
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
rang
for
the
waiter
and
then
remembering
that
he
did
not
need
anything
went
out
before
he
came
he
went
through
martin
s
street
and
peter
s
lane
and
turned
down
by
the
burnt
house
at
the
corner
of
the
picking
his
way
towards
the
bridge
the
town
was
dripping
but
the
rain
was
almost
over
the
large
drops
fell
seldomer
and
seldomer
into
the
puddles
it
was
the
hour
of
ducks
three
or
four
had
squeezed
themselves
under
a
gate
and
were
now
splashing
about
in
the
gutter
of
the
main
street
there
was
scarcely
any
one
abroad
once
or
twice
a
countryman
went
by
in
yellow
gaiters
covered
with
mud
and
looked
at
the
guest
once
an
old
woman
with
a
basket
of
clothes
recognizing
the
protestant
curate
s
made
a
low
curtsey
the
clouds
gradually
drifted
away
the
twilight
deepened
and
the
stars
came
out
the
guest
having
bought
some
cigarettes
had
spread
his
waterproof
on
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
was
now
leaning
his
elbows
upon
it
looking
at
the
river
and
feeling
at
last
quite
tranquil
his
meditations
he
repeated
to
himself
were
plated
with
silver
by
the
stars
the
water
slid
noiselessly
and
one
or
two
of
the
larger
stars
made
little
roadways
of
fire
into
the
darkness
the
light
from
a
distant
casement
made
also
its
roadway
once
or
twice
a
fish
leaped
along
the
banks
were
the
vague
shadows
of
houses
seeming
like
phantoms
gathering
to
drink
yes
he
felt
now
quite
contented
with
the
world
amidst
his
enjoyment
of
the
shadows
and
the
veritable
festival
of
mixed
pleasantly
the
knowledge
that
as
he
leant
there
with
the
light
of
a
neighbouring
flickering
faintly
on
his
refined
form
and
nervous
face
and
glancing
from
the
little
medal
of
some
anglican
order
that
hung
upon
his
he
must
have
there
had
been
any
to
being
of
a
different
kind
to
the
once
rough
and
this
town
between
these
two
feelings
the
unworldly
and
the
worldly
tossed
a
leaping
wave
of
perfect
enjoyment
how
pleasantly
conscious
of
his
own
identity
it
made
him
when
he
thought
how
he
and
not
those
whose
birthright
it
was
felt
most
the
beauty
of
these
shadows
and
this
river
to
him
who
had
read
much
seen
operas
and
plays
known
religious
experiences
and
written
verse
to
a
waterfall
in
switzerland
and
not
to
those
who
dwelt
upon
its
borders
for
their
whole
lives
did
this
river
raise
a
tumult
of
images
and
wonders
what
meaning
it
had
for
them
he
could
not
imagine
some
meaning
surely
it
must
have
as
he
gazed
out
into
the
darkness
spinning
a
web
of
thoughts
from
himself
to
the
river
from
the
river
to
himself
he
saw
with
a
corner
of
his
eye
a
spot
of
red
light
moving
in
the
air
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
he
turned
towards
it
it
came
closer
and
closer
there
appearing
behind
it
the
while
a
man
and
a
cigar
the
man
carried
in
one
hand
a
mass
of
covered
with
hooks
and
in
the
other
a
tin
porringer
full
of
bait
good
evening
good
evening
answered
the
guest
taking
his
elbows
off
the
parapet
and
looking
in
a
preoccupied
way
at
the
man
with
the
hooks
it
was
only
gradually
he
remembered
that
he
was
in
ballah
among
the
barbarians
for
his
mind
had
strayed
from
the
last
evening
gnats
making
circles
on
the
water
beneath
to
the
devil
s
song
against
the
little
spirits
in
looking
down
at
the
stone
parapet
he
considered
a
moment
and
then
burst
sherman
how
do
you
stand
this
who
have
thoughts
above
mere
eating
and
sleeping
and
are
not
always
grinding
at
the
stubble
mill
here
everybody
lives
in
the
eighteenth
squalid
century
well
i
am
going
you
know
thank
heaven
i
am
done
with
your
grey
streets
and
grey
minds
the
curate
must
come
home
sick
or
well
i
have
a
religious
essay
to
write
and
besides
i
should
die
think
of
that
old
fellow
at
the
corner
there
our
most
important
parishioner
there
are
no
more
hairs
on
his
head
than
thoughts
in
his
skull
to
merely
look
at
him
is
to
rob
life
of
its
dignity
then
there
is
nothing
in
the
shops
but
and
prizes
excellent
no
doubt
for
any
one
who
has
not
had
to
read
as
many
as
i
have
such
a
choir
such
rain
you
need
some
occupation
peculiar
to
the
place
said
the
other
baiting
his
hooks
with
worms
out
of
the
little
porringer
i
catch
eels
you
should
set
some
too
you
bait
them
with
worms
in
this
way
and
put
them
among
the
weeds
at
the
edge
of
the
river
in
the
morning
you
find
an
eel
or
two
if
you
have
good
fortune
turning
round
and
round
and
making
the
weeds
sway
i
shall
catch
a
great
many
after
this
what
a
suggestion
do
you
mean
to
stay
here
said
howard
till
your
mind
rots
like
our
most
important
parishioner
s
no
no
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
replied
the
other
i
have
some
good
looks
and
shall
try
to
turn
them
to
account
by
going
away
from
here
pretty
soon
and
trying
to
persuade
some
girl
with
money
to
fall
in
love
with
me
i
shall
not
be
altogether
a
bad
match
you
see
because
after
she
has
made
me
a
little
prosperous
my
uncle
will
die
and
make
me
much
more
so
i
wish
to
be
able
always
to
remain
a
lounger
yes
i
shall
marry
money
my
mother
has
set
her
heart
on
it
and
i
am
not
you
see
the
kind
of
person
who
falls
in
love
inconveniently
for
the
you
are
vegetating
interrupted
the
other
no
i
am
seeing
the
world
in
your
big
towns
a
man
finds
his
minority
and
knows
nothing
outside
its
border
he
knows
only
the
people
like
himself
but
here
one
chats
with
the
whole
world
in
a
day
s
walk
for
every
man
one
meets
is
a
class
the
knowledge
i
am
picking
up
may
be
useful
to
me
when
i
enter
the
great
cities
and
their
ignorance
but
i
have
lines
to
set
come
with
me
i
would
ask
you
home
but
you
and
my
mother
you
know
do
not
get
on
i
could
not
live
with
any
one
i
did
not
believe
in
said
howard
you
are
so
different
from
me
you
can
live
with
mere
facts
and
that
is
why
i
suppose
your
schemes
are
so
mercenary
before
this
beautiful
river
these
stars
these
great
purple
shadows
do
you
not
feel
like
an
insect
in
a
flower
as
for
me
i
also
have
planned
my
future
not
too
near
or
too
far
from
a
great
city
i
see
myself
in
a
cottage
with
diamond
panes
sitting
by
the
fire
there
are
books
everywhere
and
etchings
on
the
wall
on
the
table
is
a
manuscript
essay
on
some
religious
matter
perhaps
i
shall
marry
some
day
probably
not
for
i
shall
ask
so
much
certainly
i
shall
not
marry
for
money
for
i
hold
the
directness
and
sincerity
of
the
nature
to
be
its
compass
if
we
once
break
it
the
world
grows
said
sherman
briskly
i
have
baited
the
last
hook
your
schemes
suit
you
but
a
sluggish
fellow
like
me
poor
devil
who
wishes
to
lounge
through
the
world
would
find
them
they
parted
sherman
to
set
his
lines
and
howard
to
his
hotel
in
high
spirits
for
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
been
eloquent
the
which
opened
on
the
street
was
lighted
up
a
few
young
men
came
round
to
play
sometimes
he
went
in
for
among
these
provincial
youths
he
felt
besides
he
was
a
really
good
player
as
he
came
in
one
of
the
players
missed
and
swore
howard
reproved
him
with
a
look
he
joined
the
play
for
a
time
and
then
catching
sight
through
a
distant
door
of
the
s
wife
putting
a
kettle
on
the
hob
he
hurried
off
and
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fire
began
one
of
those
long
gossips
about
everybody
s
affairs
peculiar
to
the
cloth
as
sherman
having
set
his
lines
returned
home
he
passed
a
tobacconist
and
tobacconist
s
in
only
shop
in
town
except
that
remained
open
the
tobacconist
was
standing
in
his
door
and
recognizing
one
who
dealt
consistently
with
a
rival
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
muttered
there
goes
that
and
jack
o
dreams
been
fishing
most
likely
ugh
sherman
paused
for
a
moment
as
he
repassed
the
bridge
and
looked
at
the
water
on
which
now
a
and
crescent
moon
was
shining
dimly
how
full
of
memories
it
was
to
him
what
playmates
and
boyish
adventures
did
it
not
bring
to
mind
to
him
it
seemed
to
say
stay
near
to
me
as
to
howard
it
had
said
go
yonder
to
those
other
joys
and
other
sceneries
i
have
told
you
it
bade
him
who
loved
stay
still
and
dream
and
gave
flying
feet
to
him
who
imagined
ii
the
house
where
sherman
and
his
mother
lived
was
one
of
those
bare
houses
so
common
in
country
towns
their
dashed
fronts
mounting
above
empty
pavements
have
a
kind
of
dignity
in
their
utilitarianism
they
seem
to
say
fashion
has
not
made
us
nor
ever
do
its
caprices
pass
our
on
every
basement
window
is
the
same
dingy
wire
blind
on
every
door
the
same
brass
knocker
custom
everywhere
so
much
the
longer
the
blinds
seem
to
say
have
eyes
glanced
through
us
and
the
knockers
to
murmur
and
fingers
lifted
no
stephens
row
was
in
no
manner
peculiar
among
its
twenty
fellows
the
chairs
in
the
facing
the
street
were
of
heavy
mahogany
with
horsehair
cushions
worn
at
the
corners
on
the
round
table
was
somebody
s
commentary
on
the
new
testament
laid
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
on
a
of
american
oilcloth
with
stamped
japanese
figures
half
worn
away
the
room
was
seldom
used
for
sherman
was
solitary
because
silent
in
this
room
the
dressmaker
sat
twice
a
year
and
here
the
rector
s
wife
used
every
month
or
so
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
it
was
quite
clean
there
was
not
a
on
the
mirror
and
all
summer
the
fern
in
the
grate
was
constantly
changed
behind
this
room
and
overlooking
the
garden
was
the
parlour
where
chairs
took
the
place
of
mahogany
sherman
had
lived
here
with
his
mother
all
his
life
and
their
old
servant
hardly
remembered
having
lived
anywhere
else
and
soon
she
would
absolutely
cease
to
remember
the
world
she
knew
before
she
saw
the
four
walls
of
this
house
for
every
day
she
forgot
something
fresh
the
son
was
almost
thirty
the
mother
fifty
and
the
servant
near
seventy
every
year
they
had
two
hundred
pounds
among
them
and
once
a
year
the
son
got
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
went
into
the
to
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
on
the
morning
of
the
of
december
sherman
was
down
before
her
son
a
spare
woman
with
somewhat
thin
lips
tightly
closed
as
with
silent
people
and
eyes
at
once
gentle
and
distrustful
tempering
the
hardness
of
the
lips
she
helped
the
servant
to
set
the
table
and
then
for
her
ideas
would
not
allow
her
to
rest
began
to
knit
often
interrupting
her
knitting
to
go
into
the
kitchen
or
to
listen
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
at
last
hearing
a
sound
upstairs
she
put
the
eggs
down
to
boil
muttering
the
while
and
began
again
to
knit
when
her
son
appeared
she
received
him
with
a
smile
late
again
mother
he
said
the
young
should
sleep
she
answered
for
to
her
he
seemed
still
a
boy
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
some
time
before
the
young
man
and
because
it
would
have
appeared
very
wrong
to
her
to
leave
the
table
she
sat
on
knitting
behind
the
an
industry
the
benefit
of
which
was
felt
by
many
poor
the
only
neighbours
she
had
a
good
word
for
mother
said
the
young
man
presently
your
friend
the
is
off
a
good
why
are
you
so
hard
on
him
he
talked
intelligently
when
here
i
thought
answered
her
son
i
do
not
like
his
theology
she
replied
nor
his
way
of
running
about
and
flirting
with
this
body
and
that
body
nor
his
way
of
chattering
while
he
buttons
and
unbuttons
his
you
forget
he
is
a
man
of
the
great
world
and
has
about
him
a
manner
that
must
seem
strange
to
oh
he
might
do
very
well
she
answered
for
one
of
those
carton
girls
at
the
that
eldest
girl
is
a
good
girl
replied
her
son
she
looks
down
on
us
all
and
thinks
herself
intellectual
she
went
on
i
remember
when
girls
were
content
with
their
catechism
and
their
bibles
and
a
little
practice
at
the
piano
maybe
for
an
accomplishment
what
does
any
one
want
more
it
is
all
you
used
to
like
her
as
a
child
said
the
young
man
i
like
all
sherman
having
finished
his
breakfast
took
a
book
of
travels
in
one
hand
and
a
trowel
in
the
other
and
went
out
into
the
garden
having
looked
under
the
parlour
window
for
the
first
tulip
shoots
he
went
down
to
the
further
end
and
began
covering
some
for
forcing
he
had
not
been
long
at
work
when
the
servant
brought
him
a
letter
there
was
a
stone
roller
at
one
side
of
the
grass
plot
he
sat
down
upon
it
and
taking
the
letter
between
his
finger
and
thumb
began
looking
at
it
with
an
air
that
said
well
i
know
what
you
he
remained
long
thus
without
opening
it
the
book
lying
beside
him
on
the
roller
the
book
you
have
there
the
three
symbols
of
his
life
every
morning
he
worked
in
that
garden
among
the
sights
and
sounds
of
nature
month
by
month
he
planted
and
hoed
and
dug
there
in
the
middle
he
had
set
a
hedge
that
divided
the
garden
in
two
above
the
hedge
were
flowers
below
it
vegetables
at
the
furthest
end
from
the
house
lapping
broken
masonry
full
of
wallflowers
the
river
said
month
after
month
to
all
upon
its
banks
hush
he
dined
at
two
with
perfect
regularity
and
in
the
afternoon
went
out
to
shoot
or
walk
at
twilight
he
set
later
on
he
read
he
had
not
many
shakespeare
mungo
park
s
travels
a
few
novels
percy
s
reliques
and
a
volume
on
etiquette
he
seldom
varied
his
occupations
he
had
no
profession
the
town
talked
of
it
they
said
he
lives
upon
his
mother
and
were
very
angry
they
never
let
him
see
this
however
for
it
was
generally
understood
he
would
be
a
dangerous
fellow
to
rouse
but
there
was
an
uncle
from
whom
sherman
had
expectations
who
sometimes
wrote
remonstrating
sherman
resented
these
letters
for
she
was
afraid
of
her
son
going
away
to
seek
his
even
in
america
now
this
matter
preyed
somewhat
on
sherman
for
three
years
or
so
he
had
been
trying
to
make
his
mind
up
and
come
to
some
decision
sometimes
when
reading
he
would
start
and
press
his
lips
together
and
knit
his
brows
for
a
moment
it
will
now
be
seen
why
the
garden
the
book
and
the
letter
were
the
three
symbols
of
his
life
summing
up
as
they
did
his
love
of
doings
his
meditations
his
anxieties
his
life
in
the
garden
had
granted
serenity
to
his
forehead
the
reading
of
his
few
books
had
filled
his
eyes
with
reverie
and
the
feeling
that
he
was
not
quite
a
good
citizen
had
given
a
slight
and
occasional
trembling
to
his
lips
he
opened
the
letter
its
contents
were
what
he
had
long
expected
his
uncle
offered
to
take
him
into
his
office
he
laid
it
spread
out
before
foot
on
each
margin
right
and
looked
at
it
turning
the
matter
over
and
over
in
his
mind
would
he
go
would
he
stay
he
did
not
like
the
idea
much
the
lounger
in
him
did
not
enjoy
the
thought
of
london
gradually
his
mind
wandered
away
into
he
would
do
if
he
went
what
he
would
do
if
he
did
not
go
a
beetle
attracted
by
the
faint
sunlight
had
crawled
out
of
his
hole
it
saw
the
paper
and
crept
on
to
it
the
better
to
catch
the
sunlight
sherman
saw
the
beetle
but
his
mind
was
not
occupied
with
it
shall
i
tell
mary
carton
he
was
thinking
mary
had
long
been
his
adviser
and
friend
she
was
indeed
everybody
s
adviser
yes
he
would
ask
her
what
to
do
then
again
he
he
would
decide
for
himself
the
beetle
began
to
move
if
it
goes
off
the
paper
by
the
top
i
will
ask
by
the
bottom
i
will
the
beetle
went
off
by
the
top
he
got
up
with
an
air
of
decision
and
went
into
the
and
began
sorting
seeds
and
picking
out
the
light
ones
sometimes
stopping
to
watch
a
spider
for
he
knew
he
must
wait
till
the
afternoon
to
see
mary
carton
the
was
a
favourite
place
with
him
he
often
read
there
and
watched
the
spiders
in
the
corners
at
dinner
he
was
preoccupied
mother
he
said
would
you
much
mind
if
we
went
away
from
this
i
have
often
told
you
she
answered
i
do
not
like
one
place
better
than
another
i
like
them
all
equally
after
dinner
he
went
again
into
the
this
time
he
did
not
sort
watched
the
spiders
iii
towards
evening
he
went
out
the
pale
sunshine
of
winter
flickered
on
his
path
the
wind
blew
the
straws
about
he
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
a
dog
of
his
acquaintance
was
chasing
rabbits
in
a
field
he
had
never
been
known
to
catch
one
and
since
his
youth
had
never
seen
one
for
he
was
almost
wholly
blind
they
were
his
form
of
the
eternal
chimera
the
dog
left
the
field
and
followed
with
a
friendly
sniff
they
came
together
to
the
rectory
mary
carton
was
not
in
there
was
a
children
s
practice
in
the
they
went
thither
a
child
of
four
or
five
with
a
swelling
on
its
face
was
sitting
under
a
wall
opposite
the
school
door
waiting
to
make
faces
at
the
protestant
children
as
they
came
out
catching
sight
of
the
dog
she
seemed
to
debate
in
her
mind
whether
to
throw
a
stone
at
it
or
call
it
to
her
she
threw
the
stone
and
made
it
run
in
after
times
he
remembered
all
these
things
as
though
they
were
of
importance
he
opened
the
latched
green
door
and
went
in
about
twenty
children
were
singing
in
shrill
voices
standing
in
a
row
at
the
further
end
at
the
harmonium
he
recognized
mary
carton
who
nodded
to
him
and
went
on
with
her
playing
the
walls
were
covered
with
glazed
prints
of
animals
at
the
further
end
was
a
large
map
of
europe
by
a
fire
at
the
near
end
was
a
table
with
the
remains
of
tea
this
tea
was
an
idea
of
mary
s
they
had
tea
and
cake
first
afterwards
the
singing
the
floor
was
covered
with
crumbs
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
sherman
sat
down
beside
it
a
child
with
a
great
deal
of
oil
in
her
hair
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
a
form
at
the
other
side
look
she
whispered
i
have
been
sent
away
at
any
rate
they
are
further
from
the
fire
they
have
to
be
near
the
harmonium
i
would
not
sing
do
you
like
hymns
i
don
t
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
i
can
make
it
quite
well
see
i
did
not
spill
a
drop
have
you
enough
milk
it
was
a
cup
full
of
s
tea
look
there
is
a
mouse
carrying
away
a
crumb
hush
they
sat
there
the
child
watching
the
mouse
sherman
pondering
on
his
letter
until
the
music
ceased
and
the
children
came
tramping
down
the
room
the
mouse
having
fled
sherman
s
hostess
got
up
with
a
sigh
and
went
out
with
the
others
mary
carton
closed
the
harmonium
and
came
towards
sherman
her
face
and
all
her
movements
showed
a
gentle
decision
of
character
her
glance
was
serene
her
features
regular
her
figure
at
the
same
time
ample
and
beautifully
moulded
her
dress
plain
yet
not
without
a
certain
air
of
distinction
in
a
different
society
she
would
have
had
many
suitors
but
she
was
of
a
type
that
in
country
towns
does
not
get
married
at
all
its
beauty
is
too
lacking
in
pink
and
white
its
nature
in
that
small
assertiveness
admired
for
character
by
the
uninstructed
elsewhere
she
would
have
known
her
own
it
is
right
that
all
the
beautiful
have
learnt
how
to
display
it
to
add
gesture
to
her
calm
and
more
of
mirth
and
smiles
to
her
grave
cheerfulness
as
it
was
her
manner
was
much
older
than
herself
she
sat
down
by
sherman
with
the
air
of
an
old
friend
they
had
long
been
accustomed
to
consult
together
on
every
matter
they
were
such
good
friends
they
had
never
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
perfect
love
and
perfect
friendship
are
indeed
incompatible
for
the
one
is
a
battlefield
where
shadows
war
beside
the
combatants
and
the
other
a
placid
country
where
consultation
has
her
dwelling
these
two
were
such
good
friends
that
the
most
gossiping
townspeople
had
given
them
up
with
a
sigh
the
doctor
s
wife
a
faded
beauty
and
devoted
romance
reader
said
one
day
as
they
passed
they
are
such
cold
the
old
maid
who
kept
the
shop
remarked
they
are
not
of
the
marrying
sort
and
now
their
comings
and
goings
were
no
longer
noticed
nothing
had
ever
come
to
break
in
on
their
quiet
companionship
and
give
obscurity
as
a
for
the
needed
illusions
had
one
been
weak
and
the
other
strong
one
plain
and
the
other
handsome
one
guide
and
the
other
guided
one
wise
and
the
other
foolish
love
might
have
found
them
out
in
a
moment
for
love
is
based
on
inequality
as
friendship
is
on
equality
john
said
mary
carton
warming
her
hands
at
the
fire
i
have
had
a
troublesome
day
did
you
come
to
help
me
teach
the
children
to
sing
it
was
good
of
you
you
were
just
too
no
he
answered
i
have
come
to
be
your
pupil
i
am
always
your
yes
and
a
most
disobedient
well
advise
me
this
time
at
any
rate
my
uncle
has
written
offering
me
a
year
to
begin
with
in
his
london
office
am
i
to
go
you
know
quite
well
my
answer
she
said
indeed
i
do
not
why
should
i
go
i
am
contented
here
i
am
now
making
my
garden
ready
for
spring
later
on
there
will
be
trout
fishing
and
saunters
by
the
edge
of
the
river
in
the
evening
when
the
bats
are
flickering
about
in
july
there
will
be
races
i
enjoy
the
bustle
i
enjoy
life
here
when
anything
annoys
me
i
keep
away
from
it
that
is
all
you
know
i
am
always
busy
i
have
occupation
and
friends
and
am
quite
it
is
a
great
loss
to
many
of
us
but
you
must
go
john
she
said
for
you
know
you
will
be
old
some
day
and
perhaps
when
the
vitality
of
youth
is
gone
you
will
feel
that
your
life
is
empty
and
find
that
you
are
too
old
to
change
it
and
you
will
give
up
perhaps
trying
to
be
happy
and
likeable
and
become
as
the
rest
are
i
think
i
can
see
you
she
said
with
a
laugh
a
hypochondriac
like
gorman
the
retired
excise
officer
or
with
a
red
nose
like
stephens
or
growing
like
peters
the
elderly
cattle
merchant
who
starves
his
they
were
bad
material
to
begin
with
he
answered
and
besides
i
can
not
take
my
mother
away
with
me
at
her
age
and
i
can
not
leave
her
what
annoyance
it
may
be
she
answered
will
soon
be
forgotten
you
will
be
able
to
give
her
many
more
comforts
we
all
like
to
be
dressed
well
and
have
pleasant
rooms
to
sit
in
and
a
young
man
at
your
age
should
not
be
idle
you
must
go
away
from
this
little
backward
place
we
shall
miss
you
but
you
are
clever
and
must
go
and
work
with
other
men
and
have
your
talents
how
emulous
you
would
have
me
perhaps
i
shall
be
some
day
meanwhile
i
only
wish
to
stay
here
with
my
she
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
with
her
face
turned
from
him
the
evening
light
cast
a
long
shadow
behind
her
on
the
floor
after
some
moments
she
said
i
see
people
ploughing
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
there
are
people
working
on
a
house
to
the
right
everywhere
there
are
people
busy
and
with
a
slight
tremble
in
her
voice
she
added
and
john
nowhere
are
there
any
doing
what
they
wish
one
has
to
think
of
so
many
duty
and
mary
i
didn
t
know
you
were
so
coming
towards
him
with
a
smile
she
said
no
more
did
i
perhaps
but
sometimes
the
self
in
one
is
very
strong
one
has
to
think
a
great
deal
and
reason
with
it
yet
i
try
hard
to
lose
myself
in
things
about
me
these
children
often
lie
awake
thinking
about
them
that
child
who
was
talking
to
you
is
often
on
my
mind
i
do
not
know
what
will
happen
to
her
she
makes
me
unhappy
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
a
good
child
at
all
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
taught
well
at
home
i
try
hard
to
be
gentle
and
patient
with
her
i
am
a
little
displeased
with
myself
so
i
have
lectured
you
there
i
have
made
my
confession
but
she
added
taking
one
of
his
hands
in
both
hers
and
reddening
you
must
go
away
you
must
not
be
idle
you
will
gain
as
she
stood
there
with
bright
eyes
the
light
of
evening
about
her
sherman
for
perhaps
the
first
time
saw
how
beautiful
she
was
and
was
flattered
by
her
interest
for
the
first
time
also
her
presence
did
not
make
him
at
peace
with
the
world
will
you
be
an
obedient
pupil
you
know
so
much
more
than
i
do
he
answered
and
are
so
much
wiser
i
will
write
to
my
uncle
and
agree
to
his
now
you
must
go
home
she
said
you
must
not
keep
your
mother
waiting
for
her
tea
there
i
have
raked
the
fire
out
we
must
not
forget
to
lock
the
door
behind
as
they
stood
on
the
doorstep
the
wind
blew
a
whirl
of
dead
leaves
about
them
they
are
my
old
thoughts
he
said
see
they
are
all
they
walked
together
silently
at
the
vicarage
he
left
her
and
went
homeward
the
deserted
flour
store
at
the
corner
of
two
roads
the
house
that
had
been
burnt
hollow
ten
years
before
and
still
lifted
its
blackened
beams
the
straggling
and
leafless
rising
above
garden
walls
the
church
where
he
was
of
his
infancy
seemed
to
nod
and
shake
their
heads
over
him
mother
he
said
hurriedly
entering
the
room
we
are
going
to
as
you
wish
i
always
knew
you
would
be
a
rolling
stone
she
answered
and
went
out
to
tell
the
servant
that
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
the
week
s
washing
they
must
pack
up
everything
for
they
were
going
to
london
yes
we
must
pack
up
said
the
old
peasant
she
did
not
stop
peeling
the
onion
in
her
had
not
comprehended
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
suddenly
started
up
in
bed
with
a
pale
face
and
a
prayer
to
the
virgin
whose
image
hung
over
her
had
now
comprehended
iv
on
january
the
about
two
in
the
afternoon
sherman
sat
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
enjoying
a
period
of
sunshine
between
two
showers
the
steamer
was
a
cattle
boat
it
had
been
his
wish
to
travel
by
some
more
expensive
route
but
his
mother
with
her
ideas
of
duty
would
not
hear
of
it
and
now
as
he
foresaw
was
extremely
uncomfortable
below
while
he
who
was
a
good
sailor
was
pretty
happy
on
deck
and
would
have
been
quite
so
if
the
pigs
would
only
tire
of
their
continual
squealing
with
the
exception
of
a
very
dirty
old
woman
sitting
by
a
crate
of
geese
all
the
passengers
but
himself
were
below
this
old
woman
made
the
journey
monthly
with
geese
for
the
liverpool
market
sherman
was
dreaming
he
began
to
feel
very
desolate
and
commenced
a
letter
to
mary
carton
in
his
notebook
to
state
this
fact
he
was
a
laborious
and
unpractised
writer
and
found
it
helped
him
to
make
a
pencil
copy
sometimes
he
stopped
and
watched
the
puffin
sleeping
on
the
waves
each
one
of
them
had
its
head
tucked
in
in
a
somewhat
different
way
that
is
because
their
characters
are
different
he
thought
gradually
he
began
to
notice
a
great
many
corks
floating
by
one
after
the
other
the
old
woman
saw
them
too
and
said
waking
out
of
a
half
misther
john
sherman
we
will
be
in
the
mersey
before
evening
why
are
ye
goin
among
them
savages
in
london
misther
john
why
don
t
ye
stay
among
your
own
what
have
we
in
this
life
but
a
mouthful
of
air
part
ii
sherman
and
his
mother
rented
a
small
house
on
the
north
side
of
peter
s
square
hammersmith
the
front
windows
looked
out
on
to
the
old
rank
and
green
square
the
windows
behind
on
to
a
little
patch
of
garden
round
which
the
houses
gathered
and
pressed
as
though
they
already
longed
to
trample
it
out
in
this
garden
was
a
single
tall
that
never
bore
fruit
three
years
passed
by
without
any
notable
event
sherman
went
every
day
to
his
office
in
tower
hill
street
abused
his
work
a
great
deal
and
was
not
unhappy
perhaps
he
was
probably
a
bad
clerk
but
then
nobody
was
very
exacting
with
the
nephew
of
the
head
of
the
firm
the
firm
of
sherman
and
saunders
ship
brokers
was
a
house
saunders
had
been
dead
some
years
and
old
michael
sherman
ruled
old
bachelor
full
of
family
pride
and
pride
in
his
wealth
he
lived
for
all
that
in
a
very
simple
fashion
his
mahogany
furniture
was
a
little
solider
than
other
people
s
perhaps
he
did
not
understand
display
display
finds
its
excuse
in
some
taste
good
or
bad
and
in
a
long
industrious
life
michael
sherman
had
never
found
leisure
to
form
one
he
seemed
to
live
only
from
habit
year
by
year
he
grew
more
silent
gradually
ceasing
to
regard
anything
but
his
family
and
his
ships
his
family
were
represented
by
his
nephew
and
his
nephew
s
mother
he
did
not
feel
much
affection
for
them
he
believed
in
his
was
all
to
remind
him
of
the
other
goal
of
his
thoughts
hung
round
his
private
office
pictures
with
such
inscriptions
as
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
barque
in
the
mozambique
channel
the
barque
at
port
said
and
many
more
every
rope
was
drawn
accurately
with
a
ruler
and
here
and
there
were
added
distant
vessels
sailing
proudly
by
with
all
that
indifference
to
perspective
peculiar
to
the
drawings
of
sailors
on
every
ship
was
the
flag
of
the
firm
spread
out
to
show
the
letters
no
man
cared
for
old
michael
sherman
every
one
liked
john
both
were
silent
but
the
young
man
had
sometimes
a
talkative
fit
the
old
man
lived
for
his
ledger
the
young
man
for
his
dreams
in
spite
of
all
these
differences
the
uncle
was
on
the
whole
pleased
with
the
nephew
he
noticed
a
certain
stolidity
that
was
of
the
family
it
sometimes
irritated
others
it
pleased
him
he
saw
a
hundred
indications
besides
that
made
him
say
he
is
a
true
sherman
we
shermans
begin
that
way
and
give
up
frivolity
as
we
grow
old
we
are
all
the
same
in
the
sherman
and
her
son
had
but
a
small
round
of
few
rich
people
clients
of
the
house
of
sherman
and
saunders
for
the
most
part
among
these
was
a
miss
margaret
leland
who
lived
with
her
mother
the
widow
of
the
late
henry
leland
on
the
eastern
side
of
peter
s
square
their
house
was
larger
than
the
shermans
and
noticeable
among
its
fellows
by
the
hall
door
within
on
every
side
were
bronzes
and
china
vases
and
heavy
curtains
in
all
were
displayed
the
curious
and
vagrant
taste
of
margaret
leland
the
rich
italian
and
mediæval
draperies
of
the
jostling
the
brightest
and
vulgarest
products
of
more
native
and
saxon
schools
vases
of
the
most
artistic
shape
and
colour
side
by
side
with
artificial
flowers
and
stuffed
birds
this
house
belonged
to
the
lelands
they
had
bought
it
in
less
prosperous
days
and
having
altered
it
according
to
their
taste
and
the
need
of
their
growing
welfare
could
not
decide
to
leave
it
sherman
was
an
occasional
caller
at
the
lelands
and
had
certainly
a
liking
though
not
a
very
deep
one
for
margaret
as
yet
he
knew
little
more
about
her
than
that
she
wore
the
most
fascinating
hats
that
the
late
lord
lytton
was
her
favourite
author
and
that
she
hated
frogs
it
is
clear
that
she
did
not
know
that
a
french
writer
on
magic
says
the
luxurious
and
extravagant
hate
frogs
because
they
are
cold
solitary
and
dreary
had
she
done
so
she
would
have
been
more
circumspect
about
revealing
her
tastes
for
the
rest
john
sherman
was
forgetting
the
town
of
ballah
he
corresponded
indeed
with
mary
carton
but
his
laborious
letter
writing
made
his
letters
fewer
and
fewer
sometimes
too
he
heard
from
howard
who
had
a
curacy
in
glasgow
and
was
on
indifferent
terms
with
his
parishioners
they
objected
to
his
way
of
conducting
the
services
his
letters
were
full
of
it
he
would
not
give
in
he
said
whatever
happened
his
conscience
was
involved
ii
one
afternoon
leland
called
on
sherman
she
very
often
fat
sentimental
woman
moving
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
scent
the
day
was
warm
and
she
carried
her
too
elaborate
and
heavy
dress
as
a
large
drags
its
case
with
much
labour
and
patience
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
with
obvious
relief
leaning
so
heavily
among
the
cushions
that
a
in
an
antimacassar
thought
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
and
fluttered
out
only
to
be
knocked
down
and
crushed
by
sherman
who
was
very
quick
in
her
movements
as
soon
as
she
found
her
breath
leland
began
a
long
history
of
her
sorrows
her
daughter
margaret
had
been
jilted
and
was
in
despair
had
taken
to
her
bed
with
every
resolution
to
die
and
was
growing
paler
and
paler
the
man
though
she
knew
he
had
heard
did
not
relent
she
knew
he
had
heard
because
her
daughter
had
told
his
sister
all
about
it
and
his
sister
had
no
heart
because
she
said
it
was
temper
that
ailed
margaret
and
she
was
a
little
vixen
and
that
if
she
had
not
flirted
with
everybody
the
engagement
would
never
have
been
broken
off
but
sims
had
no
heart
clearly
as
miss
marriot
and
eliza
taylor
her
daughter
s
friends
said
when
they
heard
and
lock
the
butler
said
the
same
too
and
mary
young
the
housemaid
said
so
she
knew
all
about
it
for
margaret
used
to
read
his
letters
to
her
often
when
having
her
hair
brushed
she
must
have
been
very
fond
of
him
said
sherman
she
is
so
romantic
my
dear
answered
leland
with
a
sigh
i
am
afraid
she
takes
after
an
uncle
on
her
father
s
side
who
wrote
poetry
and
wore
a
velvet
jacket
and
ran
away
with
an
italian
countess
who
used
to
get
drunk
when
i
married
leland
people
said
he
was
not
worthy
of
me
and
that
i
was
throwing
myself
he
in
business
too
but
margaret
is
so
romantic
there
was
walters
the
gentleman
farmer
and
simpson
who
had
a
jeweller
s
never
approved
of
him
samuelson
and
the
hon
william
scott
she
tired
of
them
all
except
the
hon
william
scott
who
tired
of
her
because
some
one
told
him
she
put
belladonna
in
her
it
is
not
true
and
now
there
is
sims
she
then
cried
a
little
and
allowed
herself
to
be
consoled
by
sherman
you
talk
so
intelligently
and
are
so
well
informed
she
said
at
parting
i
have
made
a
very
pleasant
call
and
the
toiled
upon
its
way
arriving
in
due
course
at
other
cups
of
tea
iii
the
day
after
leland
s
call
upon
his
mother
john
sherman
returning
home
after
his
not
very
lengthy
day
in
the
office
saw
margaret
coming
towards
him
she
had
a
lawn
tennis
racket
under
her
arm
and
was
walking
slowly
on
the
shady
side
of
the
road
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
quite
irregular
features
who
though
really
not
more
than
pretty
had
so
much
manner
so
much
of
an
air
that
every
one
called
her
a
beauty
a
trefoil
with
the
fragrance
of
a
rose
mr
sherman
she
cried
coming
smiling
to
meet
him
i
have
been
ill
but
could
not
stand
the
house
any
longer
i
am
going
to
the
square
to
play
tennis
will
you
come
with
me
i
am
a
bad
player
he
said
of
course
you
are
she
answered
but
you
are
the
only
person
under
a
hundred
to
be
found
this
afternoon
how
dull
life
is
she
continued
with
a
sigh
you
heard
how
ill
i
have
been
what
do
you
do
all
day
i
sit
at
a
desk
sometimes
writing
and
sometimes
when
i
get
lazy
looking
up
at
the
flies
there
are
fourteen
on
the
plaster
of
the
ceiling
over
my
head
they
died
two
winters
ago
i
sometimes
think
to
have
them
brushed
off
but
they
have
been
there
so
long
now
i
hardly
like
ah
you
like
them
she
said
because
you
are
accustomed
to
them
in
most
cases
there
is
not
much
more
to
be
said
for
our
family
affections
i
in
a
room
close
at
hand
he
went
on
there
is
you
know
uncle
michael
who
never
precisely
you
have
an
uncle
who
never
speaks
i
have
a
mother
who
never
is
silent
she
went
to
see
sherman
the
other
day
what
did
she
say
to
her
really
what
a
dull
thing
existence
is
with
a
great
sigh
when
the
fates
are
weaving
our
web
of
life
some
mischievous
goblin
always
runs
off
with
the
everything
is
dull
and
grey
am
i
looking
a
little
pale
i
have
been
so
very
a
little
bit
pale
perhaps
he
said
doubtfully
the
square
gate
brought
them
to
a
stop
it
was
locked
but
she
had
the
key
the
lock
was
stiff
but
turned
easily
for
john
sherman
how
strong
you
are
she
said
it
was
an
iridescent
evening
of
spring
the
leaves
of
the
bushes
had
still
their
faint
green
as
margaret
darted
about
at
the
tennis
a
red
feather
in
her
cap
seemed
to
rejoice
with
its
wearer
everything
was
at
once
gay
and
tranquil
the
whole
world
had
that
unreal
air
it
assumes
at
beautiful
moments
as
though
it
might
vanish
at
a
touch
like
an
iridescent
after
a
little
margaret
said
she
was
tired
and
sitting
on
a
garden
seat
among
the
bushes
began
telling
him
the
plots
of
novels
lately
read
by
her
suddenly
she
the
were
all
serious
people
like
you
they
are
so
hard
on
people
like
me
they
always
make
us
come
to
a
bad
end
they
we
are
always
acting
acting
acting
and
what
else
do
you
serious
people
do
you
act
before
the
world
i
think
do
you
know
act
before
ourselves
all
the
old
foolish
kings
and
queens
in
history
were
like
us
they
laughed
and
beckoned
and
went
to
the
block
for
no
very
good
purpose
i
dare
say
the
headsmen
were
like
we
would
never
cut
off
so
pretty
a
oh
yes
you
would
cut
off
mine
all
this
she
said
vehemently
piercing
him
with
her
bright
eyes
you
would
cut
off
my
head
she
repeated
almost
fiercely
i
tell
you
you
her
departure
was
always
unexpected
her
moods
changed
with
so
much
rapidity
look
she
said
pointing
where
the
clock
on
peter
s
church
showed
above
the
bushes
five
minutes
to
five
in
five
minutes
my
mother
s
it
is
like
growing
old
i
go
to
gossip
the
red
feather
shone
for
a
moment
among
the
bushes
and
was
gone
iv
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
sherman
was
followed
by
those
bright
eyes
when
he
opened
a
letter
at
his
desk
they
seemed
to
gaze
at
him
from
the
open
paper
and
to
watch
him
from
the
flies
upon
the
ceiling
he
was
even
a
worse
clerk
than
usual
one
evening
he
said
to
his
mother
miss
leland
has
beautiful
my
dear
she
puts
belladonna
in
what
a
thing
to
say
i
know
she
does
though
her
mother
denies
well
she
is
certainly
beautiful
he
answered
my
dear
if
she
has
an
attraction
for
you
i
don
t
want
to
discourage
it
she
is
rich
as
girls
go
nowadays
and
one
woman
has
one
fault
another
another
one
s
untidy
one
fights
with
her
servants
one
fights
with
her
friends
another
has
a
crabbed
tongue
when
she
talks
of
sherman
became
again
silent
finding
no
fragment
of
romance
in
such
discourse
in
the
next
week
or
two
he
saw
much
of
miss
leland
he
met
her
almost
every
evening
on
his
return
from
the
office
walking
slowly
her
racket
under
her
arm
they
played
tennis
much
and
talked
more
sherman
began
to
play
tennis
in
his
dreams
miss
leland
told
him
all
about
herself
her
friends
her
inmost
feelings
and
yet
every
day
he
knew
less
about
her
it
was
not
merely
that
saying
everything
she
said
nothing
but
that
continually
there
came
through
her
wild
words
the
sound
of
the
mysterious
flutes
and
viols
of
that
unconscious
nature
which
dwells
so
much
nearer
to
woman
than
to
man
how
often
do
we
not
endow
the
beautiful
and
candid
with
depth
and
mystery
not
their
own
we
do
not
know
that
we
but
hear
in
their
voices
those
flutes
and
viols
playing
to
us
of
the
alluring
secret
of
the
world
sherman
had
never
known
in
early
life
what
is
called
first
love
and
now
when
he
had
passed
thirty
it
came
to
him
that
love
more
of
the
imagination
than
of
either
the
senses
or
affections
it
was
mainly
the
eyes
that
followed
him
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
as
this
love
grew
serious
it
grew
mercenary
now
active
now
latent
the
notion
had
long
been
in
sherman
s
mind
as
we
know
that
he
should
marry
money
a
born
lounger
riches
tempted
him
greatly
when
those
eyes
haunted
him
from
the
fourteen
flies
on
the
ceiling
he
would
say
i
should
be
rich
i
should
have
a
house
in
the
country
i
should
hunt
and
shoot
and
have
a
garden
and
three
gardeners
i
should
leave
this
abominable
then
the
eyes
became
even
more
beautiful
it
was
a
new
kind
of
belladonna
he
shrank
a
little
however
from
choosing
even
this
pleasant
pathway
he
had
planned
many
futures
for
himself
and
learnt
to
love
them
all
it
was
this
that
had
made
him
linger
on
at
ballah
for
so
long
and
it
was
this
that
now
kept
him
undecided
he
would
have
to
give
up
the
universe
for
a
garden
and
three
gardeners
how
sad
it
was
to
make
substantial
even
the
best
of
his
dreams
how
hard
it
was
to
submit
to
that
decree
which
compels
every
step
we
take
in
life
to
be
a
death
in
the
imagination
how
difficult
it
was
to
be
so
enwrapped
in
this
one
new
hope
as
not
to
hear
the
lamentations
that
were
going
on
in
dim
corners
of
his
mind
one
day
he
resolved
to
propose
he
examined
himself
in
the
glass
in
the
morning
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
smiled
to
see
how
he
was
in
the
evening
before
leaving
the
office
he
peered
at
himself
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantlepiece
in
the
room
where
customers
were
received
the
sun
was
blazing
through
the
window
full
on
his
face
he
did
not
look
so
well
immediately
all
courage
left
him
that
evening
he
went
out
after
his
mother
had
gone
to
bed
and
walked
far
along
the
of
the
thames
a
faint
mist
half
covered
away
the
houses
and
factory
chimneys
on
the
further
side
beside
him
a
band
of
osiers
swayed
softly
the
deserted
and
full
river
lapping
their
stems
he
looked
on
all
these
things
with
foreign
eyes
he
had
no
sense
of
possession
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
in
london
was
owned
by
too
many
to
be
owned
by
any
one
another
river
that
he
did
seem
to
possess
flowed
through
his
memory
with
all
its
familiar
riding
in
the
stream
to
the
fish
leaping
raising
their
small
ripples
a
swan
asleep
the
wallflowers
growing
on
the
red
brick
of
the
margin
he
grew
very
sad
suddenly
a
shooting
star
fiery
and
vagabond
leaped
from
the
darkness
it
brought
his
mind
again
in
a
moment
to
margaret
leland
to
marry
her
he
thought
was
to
separate
himself
from
the
old
life
he
loved
so
well
crossing
the
river
at
putney
he
hurried
homewards
among
the
market
gardens
nearing
home
the
streets
were
deserted
the
shops
closed
where
king
street
joins
the
broadway
entirely
alone
with
itself
in
the
very
centre
of
the
road
a
little
black
cat
was
leaping
after
its
shadow
ah
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
be
a
little
black
cat
to
leap
about
in
the
moonlight
and
sleep
in
the
sunlight
and
catch
flies
to
have
no
hard
tasks
to
do
or
hard
decisions
to
come
to
to
be
simple
and
full
of
animal
at
the
corner
of
bridge
road
was
a
the
only
sign
of
human
life
he
bought
some
cold
meat
and
flung
it
to
the
little
black
cat
some
more
days
went
by
at
last
one
day
arriving
at
the
square
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
and
sitting
down
to
wait
for
margaret
on
the
seat
among
the
bushes
he
noticed
the
pieces
of
a
letter
lying
about
beside
him
on
the
seat
was
a
pencil
as
though
some
one
had
been
writing
there
and
left
it
behind
them
the
was
worn
very
short
the
letter
had
been
torn
up
perhaps
in
a
fit
of
impatience
in
a
way
he
glanced
over
the
scraps
on
one
of
them
he
read
my
dear
eliza
an
incurable
gossip
my
mother
is
you
heard
of
my
misfortune
i
nearly
here
he
had
to
search
among
the
scraps
at
last
he
found
one
that
seemed
to
follow
perhaps
you
will
hear
news
from
me
soon
there
is
a
handsome
young
man
who
pays
me
attention
here
another
piece
had
to
be
found
i
would
take
him
though
he
had
a
face
like
the
man
in
the
moon
and
limped
like
the
devil
at
the
theatre
perhaps
i
am
a
little
in
love
oh
friend
of
my
here
it
broke
off
again
he
was
interested
and
searched
the
grass
and
the
bushes
for
fragments
some
had
been
blown
to
quite
a
distance
he
got
together
several
sentences
now
i
will
not
spend
another
winter
with
my
mother
for
anything
all
this
is
of
course
a
secret
i
had
to
tell
somebody
secrets
are
bad
for
my
health
perhaps
it
will
all
come
to
then
the
letter
went
off
into
dress
the
last
novel
the
writer
had
read
and
so
forth
a
miss
sims
too
was
mentioned
who
had
said
some
unkind
thing
of
the
writer
sherman
was
greatly
amused
it
did
not
seem
to
him
wrong
to
do
not
mind
spying
on
one
of
the
crowd
any
more
than
on
the
personages
of
literature
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
or
any
friend
of
his
was
concerned
in
these
pencil
scribblings
suddenly
he
saw
this
sentence
heigho
your
poor
margaret
is
falling
in
love
again
condole
with
her
my
he
started
the
name
margaret
the
mention
of
miss
sims
the
style
of
the
whole
letter
all
made
plain
the
authorship
very
desperately
ashamed
of
himself
he
got
up
and
tore
each
scrap
of
paper
into
still
smaller
fragments
and
scattered
them
far
apart
that
evening
he
proposed
and
was
accepted
vi
for
several
days
there
was
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
miss
leland
seemed
suddenly
impressed
with
the
seriousness
of
life
she
was
gentleness
itself
and
as
sherman
sat
on
sunday
mornings
in
his
of
a
garden
under
the
one
tree
with
its
smoky
stem
watching
the
little
circles
of
sunlight
falling
from
the
leaves
like
a
shower
of
new
sovereigns
he
gazed
at
them
with
a
longer
and
keener
joy
than
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
surely
sherman
planted
and
dug
and
raked
this
of
a
garden
most
diligently
rooting
out
the
docks
and
dandelions
and
and
the
patches
of
untimely
grass
it
was
the
point
of
contact
between
his
new
life
and
the
old
it
was
far
too
small
and
unfertile
and
shaded
in
to
satisfy
his
love
of
gardener
s
experiments
and
early
vegetables
perforce
this
husbandry
was
too
little
complex
for
his
affections
to
gather
much
round
plant
and
bed
his
garden
in
ballah
used
to
touch
him
like
the
growth
of
a
young
family
now
he
was
content
to
satisfy
his
barbaric
sense
of
colour
right
round
were
planted
alternate
holyhock
and
sunflower
and
behind
them
showed
their
cloven
shoots
one
sunday
it
occurred
to
him
to
write
to
his
friends
on
the
matter
of
his
engagement
he
numbered
them
over
howard
one
or
two
less
intimate
and
mary
carton
at
that
name
he
paused
he
would
not
write
just
yet
vii
one
saturday
there
was
a
tennis
party
miss
leland
devoted
herself
all
day
to
a
young
foreign
office
clerk
she
played
tennis
with
him
talked
with
him
drank
lemonade
with
him
had
neither
thoughts
nor
words
for
any
one
else
john
sherman
was
quite
happy
tennis
was
always
a
bore
and
now
he
was
not
called
upon
to
play
it
had
not
struck
him
there
was
occasion
for
jealousy
as
the
guests
were
dispersing
his
betrothed
came
to
him
her
manner
seemed
strange
does
anything
ail
you
margaret
he
asked
as
they
left
the
square
everything
she
answered
looking
about
her
with
ostentatious
secrecy
you
are
a
most
annoying
person
you
have
no
feeling
you
have
no
temperament
you
are
quite
the
most
stupid
creature
i
was
ever
engaged
what
is
wrong
with
you
he
asked
in
bewilderment
don
t
you
see
she
replied
with
a
broken
voice
i
flirted
all
day
with
that
young
clerk
you
should
have
nearly
killed
me
with
jealousy
you
do
not
love
me
a
bit
there
is
no
knowing
what
i
might
do
well
you
know
he
said
it
was
not
right
of
you
people
might
say
look
at
john
sherman
how
furious
he
must
be
to
be
sure
i
wouldn
t
be
furious
a
bit
but
then
they
d
go
about
saying
i
was
it
would
not
matter
of
course
but
you
know
it
is
not
right
of
it
is
no
use
pretending
you
have
feeling
it
is
all
that
miserable
little
town
you
come
from
with
its
sleepy
old
shops
and
its
sleepy
old
society
i
would
give
up
loving
you
this
minute
she
added
with
a
caressing
look
if
you
had
not
that
beautiful
bronzed
face
i
will
improve
you
evening
you
must
come
to
the
suddenly
she
changed
the
subject
do
you
see
that
little
fat
man
coming
out
of
the
square
and
staring
at
me
i
was
engaged
to
him
once
look
at
the
four
old
ladies
behind
him
shaking
their
bonnets
at
me
each
has
some
story
about
me
and
it
will
be
all
the
same
in
a
hundred
after
this
he
had
hardly
a
moment
s
peace
she
kept
him
continually
going
to
theatres
operas
parties
these
last
were
an
especial
trouble
for
it
was
her
wont
to
gather
about
her
an
admiring
circle
to
listen
to
her
extravagancies
and
he
was
no
longer
at
the
age
when
we
enjoy
audacity
for
its
own
sake
viii
gradually
those
bright
eyes
of
his
imagination
watching
him
from
letters
and
from
among
the
fourteen
flies
on
the
ceiling
had
ceased
to
be
centres
of
peace
they
seemed
like
two
whirlpools
wherein
the
order
and
quiet
of
his
life
were
absorbed
hourly
and
daily
he
still
thought
sometimes
of
the
country
house
of
his
dreams
and
of
the
garden
and
the
three
gardeners
but
somehow
they
had
lost
half
their
charm
he
had
written
to
howard
and
some
others
and
commenced
at
last
a
letter
to
mary
carton
it
lay
unfinished
on
his
desk
a
thin
coating
of
dust
was
gathering
upon
it
leland
called
continually
on
sherman
she
sentimentalized
over
the
lovers
and
even
wept
over
them
each
visit
supplied
the
household
with
conversation
for
a
week
every
sunday
looked
at
his
uncompleted
letter
gradually
it
became
plain
to
him
he
could
not
finish
it
it
had
never
seemed
to
him
he
had
more
than
friendship
for
mary
carton
yet
somehow
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
her
of
this
the
more
his
betrothed
troubled
him
the
more
he
thought
about
the
unfinished
letter
he
was
a
man
standing
at
the
whenever
the
wind
blew
from
the
south
he
remembered
his
friend
for
that
is
the
wind
that
fills
the
heart
with
memory
one
sunday
he
removed
the
dust
from
the
face
of
the
letter
almost
reverently
as
though
it
were
the
dust
from
the
wheels
of
destiny
but
the
letter
remained
unfinished
ix
one
wednesday
in
june
sherman
arrived
home
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
from
his
office
as
his
wont
was
the
first
wednesday
in
every
month
on
which
day
his
mother
was
at
home
to
her
friends
they
had
not
many
callers
there
was
no
one
as
yet
but
a
old
lady
his
mother
had
picked
up
he
knew
not
where
she
had
been
looking
at
his
photograph
album
and
recalling
names
and
dates
from
her
own
prosperous
times
as
she
went
out
miss
leland
came
in
she
gave
the
old
lady
in
passing
a
critical
look
that
made
the
poor
creature
very
conscious
of
a
threadbare
mantle
and
went
over
to
sherman
holding
out
both
hands
sherman
who
knew
all
his
mother
s
peculiarities
noticed
on
her
side
a
slight
coldness
perhaps
she
did
not
altogether
like
this
beautiful
i
have
come
said
miss
leland
to
tell
john
that
he
must
learn
to
paint
music
and
society
are
not
enough
there
is
nothing
like
art
to
give
then
turning
to
john
my
dear
i
will
make
you
quite
different
you
are
a
dreadful
barbarian
you
what
ails
me
margaret
just
look
at
that
necktie
nothing
shows
a
man
s
cultivation
like
his
necktie
then
your
reading
you
never
read
anything
but
old
books
nobody
wants
to
talk
about
i
will
lend
you
three
every
one
has
read
this
month
you
really
must
acquire
small
talk
and
change
your
presently
she
noticed
the
lying
open
on
a
chair
oh
she
cried
i
must
have
another
look
at
john
s
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
gather
all
manner
of
pretty
faces
it
came
from
incipient
old
bachelorhood
perhaps
margaret
criticized
each
photo
in
turn
with
ah
she
looks
as
if
she
had
some
life
in
her
or
i
do
not
like
your
sleepy
eyelids
or
some
such
phrase
the
mere
relations
were
passed
by
without
a
word
one
face
occurred
several
quiet
face
as
margaret
came
on
this
one
for
the
third
time
sherman
who
seemed
a
little
resentful
about
something
that
is
his
friend
mary
he
told
me
about
her
he
has
a
book
she
gave
him
so
that
is
she
how
interesting
i
pity
these
poor
country
people
it
must
be
hard
to
keep
from
getting
my
friend
is
not
at
all
stupid
said
sherman
does
she
speak
with
a
brogue
i
remember
you
told
me
she
was
very
good
it
must
be
difficult
to
keep
from
talking
platitudes
when
one
is
very
you
are
quite
wrong
about
her
you
would
like
her
very
much
he
replied
she
is
one
of
those
people
i
suppose
who
can
only
talk
about
their
relatives
or
their
families
or
about
their
friends
children
how
this
one
has
got
the
and
this
one
is
getting
well
of
the
measles
she
kept
swaying
one
of
the
leaves
between
her
finger
and
thumb
impatiently
what
a
strange
way
she
does
her
hair
and
what
an
ugly
dress
you
must
not
talk
that
way
about
is
my
great
friend
friend
she
burst
out
he
thinks
i
will
believe
in
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
she
got
up
and
said
turning
round
with
an
air
of
changing
the
subject
have
you
written
to
your
friends
about
our
engagement
you
had
not
done
so
when
i
asked
you
i
all
well
not
your
great
friend
do
you
call
her
miss
carton
i
have
not
written
to
she
tapped
impatiently
with
her
foot
they
were
really
old
is
all
said
sherman
wishing
to
mend
matters
they
were
both
readers
that
brought
them
together
i
never
much
fancied
her
yet
she
was
well
enough
as
a
friend
and
helped
maybe
with
reading
and
the
gardening
and
his
good
to
keep
him
from
the
idle
young
men
of
the
you
must
make
him
write
and
tell
her
at
must
you
must
almost
sobbed
out
miss
leland
i
promise
he
answered
immediately
returning
to
herself
she
cried
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
know
what
i
would
like
to
do
when
i
got
the
letter
i
know
who
i
would
like
to
kill
with
a
laugh
as
she
went
over
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantlepiece
part
iii
sherman
revisits
i
the
others
had
gone
and
sherman
was
alone
in
the
by
himself
looking
through
the
window
never
had
london
seemed
to
him
so
like
a
reef
whereon
he
was
cast
away
in
the
square
the
bushes
were
covered
with
dust
some
sparrows
were
ruffling
their
feathers
on
the
people
passed
continually
disturbing
them
the
sky
was
full
of
smoke
a
terrible
feeling
of
solitude
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
oppressed
him
a
portion
of
his
life
was
ending
he
thought
that
soon
he
would
be
no
longer
a
young
man
and
now
at
the
period
when
the
desire
of
novelty
grows
less
was
coming
the
great
change
of
his
life
he
felt
he
was
of
those
whose
granaries
are
in
the
past
and
now
this
past
would
never
renew
itself
he
was
going
out
into
the
distance
as
though
with
strange
sailors
in
a
strange
ship
he
longed
to
see
again
the
town
where
he
had
spent
his
childhood
to
see
the
narrow
roads
and
mean
little
shops
and
perhaps
it
would
be
easier
to
tell
her
who
had
been
the
friend
of
so
many
years
of
this
engagement
in
his
own
person
than
by
letter
he
wondered
why
it
was
so
hard
to
write
so
simple
a
thing
it
was
his
custom
to
act
suddenly
on
his
decisions
he
had
not
made
many
in
his
life
the
next
day
he
announced
at
the
office
that
he
would
be
absent
for
three
or
four
days
he
told
his
mother
he
had
business
in
the
country
his
betrothed
met
him
on
the
way
to
the
terminus
as
he
was
walking
bag
in
hand
and
asked
where
he
was
going
i
am
going
on
business
to
the
country
he
said
and
blushed
he
was
creeping
away
like
a
thief
ii
he
arrived
in
the
town
of
ballah
by
rail
for
he
had
avoided
the
slow
cattle
steamer
and
gone
by
dublin
it
was
the
forenoon
and
he
made
for
the
imperial
hotel
to
wait
till
four
in
the
evening
when
he
would
find
mary
carton
in
the
schoolhouse
for
he
had
timed
his
journey
so
as
to
arrive
on
thursday
the
day
of
the
children
s
practice
as
he
went
through
the
streets
his
heart
went
out
to
every
familiar
place
and
sight
the
rows
of
thatched
cottages
the
slated
roofs
of
the
shops
the
women
selling
gooseberries
the
river
bridge
the
high
walls
of
the
garden
where
it
was
said
the
gardener
used
to
see
the
ghost
of
a
former
owner
in
the
shape
of
a
rabbit
the
street
corner
no
child
would
pass
at
nightfall
for
fear
of
the
headless
soldier
the
deserted
flour
store
the
wharves
covered
with
grass
all
these
he
watched
with
celtic
devotion
that
devotion
carried
to
the
ends
of
the
world
by
the
celtic
exiles
and
since
old
time
surrounding
their
journeyings
with
rumour
of
plaintive
songs
he
sat
in
the
window
of
the
imperial
hotel
now
full
of
guests
he
did
not
notice
any
of
them
he
sat
there
meditating
meditating
grey
clouds
covering
the
town
with
flying
shadows
rushed
by
like
the
old
and
dishevelled
eagles
that
maeldune
saw
hurrying
towards
the
waters
of
life
below
in
the
street
passed
by
country
people
townspeople
travellers
women
with
baskets
boys
driving
donkeys
old
men
with
sticks
sometimes
he
recognized
a
face
or
was
recognized
himself
and
welcomed
by
some
familiar
voice
you
have
come
home
a
handsomer
gentleman
than
your
father
misther
john
and
he
was
a
neat
figure
of
a
man
god
bless
him
said
the
waiter
bringing
him
his
lunch
and
in
truth
sherman
had
grown
handsomer
for
these
years
away
his
face
and
gesture
had
more
of
dignity
for
on
the
centre
of
his
nature
life
had
dropped
a
pinch
of
experience
at
four
he
left
the
hotel
and
waited
near
the
schoolhouse
till
the
children
came
running
out
one
or
two
of
the
elder
ones
he
recognized
but
turned
away
iii
mary
carton
was
locking
the
harmonium
as
he
went
in
she
came
to
meet
him
with
a
surprised
and
joyful
air
how
often
i
have
wished
to
see
you
when
did
you
come
how
well
you
remembered
my
habits
to
know
where
to
find
me
my
dear
john
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
are
the
same
as
when
i
left
and
this
room
is
the
same
yes
she
answered
the
same
only
i
have
had
some
new
prints
hung
of
fruits
and
leaves
and
it
was
only
done
last
week
when
people
choose
pictures
and
poems
for
children
they
choose
out
such
domestic
ones
i
would
not
have
any
of
the
kind
children
are
such
undomestic
animals
but
john
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
in
this
old
schoolhouse
again
so
little
has
changed
with
us
here
some
have
died
and
some
have
been
married
and
we
are
all
a
little
older
and
the
trees
a
little
i
have
come
to
tell
you
i
am
going
to
be
she
became
in
a
moment
perfectly
white
and
sat
down
as
though
attacked
with
faintness
her
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
trembled
sherman
looked
at
her
and
went
on
in
a
bewildered
mechanical
my
betrothed
is
a
miss
leland
she
has
a
good
deal
of
money
you
know
my
mother
always
wished
me
to
marry
some
one
with
money
her
father
when
alive
was
an
old
client
of
sherman
and
saunders
she
is
much
admired
in
gradually
his
voice
became
a
mere
murmur
he
did
not
seem
to
know
that
he
was
speaking
he
stopped
entirely
he
was
looking
at
mary
carton
everything
around
him
was
as
it
had
been
some
three
years
before
the
table
was
covered
with
cups
and
the
floor
with
crumbs
perhaps
the
mouse
pulling
at
a
crumb
under
the
table
was
the
same
mouse
as
on
that
other
evening
the
only
difference
was
the
brooding
daylight
of
summer
and
the
ceaseless
chirruping
of
the
sparrows
in
the
ivy
outside
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
having
lost
his
way
it
was
just
the
same
feeling
he
had
known
as
a
child
when
one
dark
night
he
had
taken
a
wrong
turning
and
instead
of
arriving
at
his
own
house
found
himself
at
a
landmark
he
knew
was
miles
from
home
a
moment
earlier
however
difficult
his
life
the
issues
were
always
definite
now
suddenly
had
entered
the
obscurity
of
another
s
interest
before
this
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
mary
carton
had
any
stronger
feeling
for
him
than
warm
friendship
he
began
again
speaking
in
the
same
mechanical
miss
leland
lives
with
her
mother
near
us
she
is
very
well
educated
and
very
well
connected
though
she
has
lived
always
among
business
miss
carton
with
a
great
effort
had
recovered
her
composure
i
congratulate
you
she
said
i
hope
you
will
be
always
happy
you
came
here
on
some
business
for
your
firm
i
suppose
i
believe
they
have
some
connection
with
the
town
i
only
came
here
to
tell
you
i
was
going
to
be
do
you
not
think
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
written
she
said
beginning
to
put
away
the
children
s
in
a
cupboard
by
the
fireplace
it
would
have
been
better
he
answered
drooping
his
head
without
a
word
locking
the
door
behind
them
they
went
out
without
a
word
they
walked
the
grey
streets
now
and
then
a
woman
or
a
child
curtseyed
as
they
passed
some
wondered
perhaps
to
see
these
old
friends
so
silent
at
the
rectory
they
bade
each
other
i
hope
you
will
be
always
happy
she
said
i
will
pray
for
you
and
your
wife
i
am
very
busy
with
the
children
and
old
people
but
i
shall
always
find
a
moment
to
wish
you
well
in
they
parted
the
gate
in
the
wall
closed
behind
her
he
stayed
for
a
few
moments
looking
up
at
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
bushes
showing
over
the
wall
and
at
the
house
a
little
way
beyond
he
stood
considering
his
life
his
life
his
at
any
rate
would
have
incident
and
change
hers
would
be
the
narrow
existence
of
a
woman
who
failing
to
fulfil
the
only
abiding
wish
she
has
ever
formed
seeks
to
lose
herself
in
of
things
on
this
old
planet
this
had
been
revealed
he
loved
mary
carton
she
loved
him
he
remembered
margaret
leland
and
murmured
she
did
well
to
be
jealous
then
all
her
contemptuous
words
about
the
town
and
its
inhabitants
came
into
his
mind
once
they
made
no
impression
on
him
but
now
the
sense
of
personal
identity
having
been
disturbed
by
this
sudden
revelation
alien
as
they
were
to
his
way
of
thinking
they
began
to
press
in
on
him
mary
too
would
have
agreed
with
them
he
thought
and
might
it
be
that
at
some
distant
time
weary
monotony
in
abandonment
would
have
so
weighed
down
the
spirit
of
mary
carton
that
she
would
be
merely
one
of
the
old
and
sleepy
whose
dulness
filled
the
place
like
a
cloud
he
went
sadly
towards
the
hotel
everything
about
him
the
road
the
sky
the
feet
wherewith
he
walked
seeming
phantasmal
and
without
meaning
he
told
the
waiter
he
would
leave
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
what
and
you
only
just
come
home
the
man
answered
he
ordered
coffee
and
could
not
drink
it
he
went
out
and
came
in
again
immediately
he
went
down
into
the
kitchen
and
talked
to
the
servants
they
told
him
of
everything
that
had
happened
since
he
had
gone
he
was
not
interested
and
went
up
to
his
room
i
must
go
home
and
do
what
people
expect
of
me
one
must
be
careful
to
do
through
all
the
journey
home
his
problem
troubled
him
he
saw
the
figure
of
mary
carton
perpetually
passing
through
a
round
of
monotonous
duties
he
saw
his
own
life
among
aliens
going
on
endlessly
wearily
from
holyhead
to
london
his
were
a
lady
and
her
three
young
daughters
the
eldest
about
twelve
the
smooth
faces
shining
with
became
to
him
ominous
symbols
he
hated
them
they
were
symbolic
of
the
indifferent
world
about
to
absorb
him
and
of
the
vague
something
that
was
dragging
him
inch
by
inch
from
the
nook
he
had
made
for
himself
in
the
chimney
corner
he
was
at
one
of
those
dangerous
moments
when
the
sense
of
personal
identity
is
shaken
when
one
s
past
and
present
seem
about
to
dissolve
partnership
he
sought
refuge
in
memory
and
counted
over
every
word
of
mary
s
he
could
remember
he
forgot
the
present
and
the
future
without
love
he
said
to
himself
we
would
be
either
gods
or
the
rain
beat
on
the
window
of
the
carriage
he
began
to
listen
thought
and
memory
became
a
blank
his
mind
was
full
of
the
sound
of
part
iv
rev
william
i
after
his
return
to
london
sherman
for
a
time
kept
to
himself
going
straight
home
from
his
office
moody
and
trying
not
to
consider
his
life
his
life
he
often
repeated
to
himself
i
must
do
what
people
expect
of
me
it
does
not
rest
with
me
choosing
time
is
he
felt
that
whatever
way
he
turned
he
would
do
a
great
evil
to
himself
and
others
to
his
nature
all
sudden
decisions
were
difficult
and
so
he
kept
to
the
groove
he
had
entered
upon
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
do
otherwise
he
never
thought
of
breaking
this
engagement
off
and
letting
people
say
what
they
would
he
was
bound
in
hopelessly
by
a
chain
of
congratulations
a
week
passed
slowly
as
a
month
the
wheels
of
the
cabs
and
carriages
seemed
to
be
rolling
through
his
mind
he
often
remembered
the
quiet
river
at
the
end
of
his
garden
in
the
town
of
ballah
how
the
weeds
swayed
there
and
the
salmon
leaped
at
the
week
s
end
came
a
note
from
miss
leland
complaining
of
his
neglecting
her
so
many
days
he
sent
a
rather
formal
answer
promising
to
call
soon
to
add
to
his
other
troubles
a
cold
east
wind
arose
and
made
him
shiver
continually
one
evening
he
and
his
mother
were
sitting
silent
the
one
knitting
the
other
he
had
been
writing
letters
and
was
now
in
a
reverie
round
the
walls
were
one
or
two
drawings
done
by
him
at
school
his
mother
had
got
them
framed
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
drawing
of
a
stream
and
some
astonishing
cows
a
few
days
ago
he
had
found
an
old
for
children
among
some
forgotten
papers
which
taught
how
to
draw
a
horse
by
making
three
ovals
for
the
basis
of
his
body
one
lying
down
in
the
middle
two
standing
up
at
each
end
for
flank
and
chest
and
how
to
draw
a
cow
by
basing
its
body
on
a
square
he
kept
trying
to
fit
squares
into
the
cows
he
was
half
inclined
to
take
them
out
of
their
frames
and
retouch
on
this
new
principle
then
he
began
somehow
to
remember
the
child
with
the
swollen
face
who
threw
a
stone
at
the
dog
the
day
he
resolved
to
leave
home
first
then
some
other
image
came
his
problem
moved
before
him
in
a
disjointed
way
he
was
dropping
asleep
through
his
reverie
came
the
click
click
of
his
mother
s
needles
she
had
found
some
london
children
to
knit
for
he
was
at
that
marchland
between
waking
and
dreaming
where
our
thoughts
begin
to
have
a
life
of
their
region
where
art
is
nurtured
and
inspiration
born
he
started
hearing
something
sliding
and
rustling
and
looked
up
to
see
a
piece
of
cardboard
fall
from
one
end
of
the
mantlepiece
and
driven
by
a
slight
gust
of
air
circle
into
the
ashes
under
the
grate
oh
said
his
mother
that
is
the
portrait
of
the
she
still
spoke
of
the
rev
william
howard
by
the
name
she
had
first
known
him
by
he
is
always
being
photographed
they
are
all
over
the
house
and
i
an
old
woman
have
not
had
one
taken
all
my
life
take
it
out
with
the
her
son
after
some
poking
in
the
ashes
for
it
had
fallen
far
back
brought
out
a
somewhat
dusty
photograph
that
she
continued
is
one
he
sent
us
two
or
three
months
ago
it
has
been
lying
in
the
he
is
not
so
spick
and
span
looking
as
usual
said
sherman
rubbing
the
ashes
off
the
photograph
with
his
sleeve
by
the
by
his
mother
replied
he
has
lost
his
parish
i
hear
he
is
very
mediæval
you
know
and
he
lately
preached
a
sermon
to
prove
that
children
who
die
unbaptized
are
lost
he
had
been
reading
up
the
subject
and
was
full
of
it
the
mothers
turned
against
him
not
being
so
familiar
with
augustine
as
he
was
there
were
other
reasons
in
plenty
too
i
wonder
that
any
one
can
stand
that
monkeyish
fantastic
as
the
way
is
with
so
many
people
the
world
for
her
was
divided
up
into
families
rather
than
individuals
while
she
was
talking
sherman
who
had
returned
to
his
chair
leant
over
the
table
and
began
to
write
hurriedly
she
was
continuing
her
denunciation
when
he
interrupted
mother
i
have
just
written
this
letter
to
him
my
dear
howard
will
you
come
and
spend
the
autumn
with
us
i
hear
you
are
unoccupied
just
now
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
as
you
know
it
will
be
a
long
engagement
you
will
like
my
betrothed
i
hope
you
will
be
great
friends
yours
expectantly
john
you
rather
take
me
aback
she
said
i
really
like
him
he
answered
you
were
always
prejudiced
against
the
howards
forgive
me
but
i
really
want
very
much
to
have
him
well
if
you
like
him
i
suppose
i
have
no
i
do
like
him
he
is
very
clever
said
her
son
and
knows
a
great
deal
i
wonder
he
does
not
marry
do
you
not
think
he
would
make
a
good
husband
you
must
admit
he
is
it
is
not
difficult
to
sympathize
with
every
one
if
you
have
no
true
principles
and
principles
and
convictions
were
her
names
for
that
strenuous
consistency
attained
without
trouble
by
men
and
women
of
few
ideas
i
am
sure
you
will
like
him
better
said
the
other
when
you
see
more
of
is
that
photograph
quite
spoilt
she
answered
no
there
was
nothing
on
it
but
that
is
a
pity
for
one
less
would
be
after
this
they
both
became
silent
she
knitting
he
gazing
at
the
cows
browsing
at
the
edge
of
their
stream
and
trying
to
fit
squares
into
their
bodies
but
now
a
smile
played
about
his
lips
sherman
looked
a
little
troubled
she
would
not
object
to
any
visitor
of
her
son
s
but
quite
made
up
her
mind
in
no
manner
to
put
herself
out
to
entertain
the
rev
william
howard
she
was
puzzled
as
well
she
did
not
understand
the
suddenness
of
this
invitation
they
usually
talked
over
things
for
weeks
ii
next
day
his
noticed
a
decided
improvement
in
sherman
s
spirits
he
had
a
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
breaking
out
at
odd
moments
when
evening
came
he
called
for
the
first
time
since
his
return
on
miss
leland
she
scolded
him
roundly
for
having
answered
her
note
in
such
a
formal
way
but
was
sincerely
glad
to
see
him
return
to
his
allegiance
we
have
said
he
had
sometimes
though
rarely
a
talkative
fit
he
had
one
this
evening
the
last
play
they
had
been
to
the
last
party
the
picture
of
the
year
all
in
turn
he
glanced
at
she
was
delighted
her
training
had
not
been
in
vain
her
barbarian
was
learning
to
chatter
this
flattered
her
a
deal
i
was
never
engaged
she
thought
to
a
more
interesting
when
he
had
risen
to
go
sherman
i
have
a
friend
coming
to
visit
me
in
a
few
days
you
will
suit
each
other
delightfully
he
is
very
do
tell
me
about
him
i
like
everything
oh
he
cried
with
a
laugh
his
mediævalism
is
not
in
your
line
he
is
neither
a
gay
troubadour
nor
a
wicked
knight
he
is
a
high
church
do
not
tell
me
anything
more
about
him
she
answered
i
will
try
to
be
civil
to
him
but
you
know
i
never
liked
curates
i
have
been
an
agnostic
for
many
years
you
i
believe
are
as
sherman
was
on
his
way
home
he
met
a
and
stopped
him
are
you
an
agnostic
no
why
what
is
that
oh
nothing
he
made
answer
and
hurried
on
his
way
iii
the
letter
reached
the
rev
william
howard
at
the
right
moment
arriving
as
it
did
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
in
his
fortunes
in
the
course
of
a
short
life
he
had
lost
many
parishes
he
considered
himself
a
martyr
but
was
considered
by
his
enemies
a
clerical
coxcomb
he
had
a
habit
of
getting
his
mind
possessed
with
some
strange
opinion
or
what
seemed
so
to
his
parishioners
and
of
preaching
it
while
the
notion
lasted
in
the
most
startling
way
the
sermon
on
unbaptized
children
was
an
instance
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
thought
it
true
as
that
it
possessed
him
for
a
day
it
was
not
so
much
the
thought
as
his
own
relation
to
it
that
allured
him
then
too
he
loved
what
appeared
to
his
parishioners
to
be
the
most
unusual
and
dangerous
practices
he
put
candles
on
the
altar
and
crosses
in
unexpected
places
he
delighted
in
the
intricacies
of
high
church
costume
and
was
known
to
recommend
confession
and
prayers
for
the
dead
gradually
the
anger
of
his
parishioners
would
increase
the
rector
the
washerwoman
the
labourers
the
squire
the
doctor
the
school
teachers
the
shoemakers
the
butchers
the
seamstresses
the
local
journalist
the
master
of
the
hounds
the
innkeeper
the
veterinary
surgeon
the
magistrate
the
children
making
mud
pies
all
would
be
filled
with
one
then
he
would
fly
for
consolation
to
his
little
circle
of
the
faithful
the
younger
ladies
who
still
repeated
his
fine
sentiments
and
saw
him
in
their
imaginations
standing
perpetually
before
a
wall
covered
with
tapestry
and
holding
a
crucifix
in
some
constrained
and
ancient
attitude
at
last
he
would
have
to
go
feeling
for
his
parishioners
a
gay
and
lofty
disdain
and
for
himself
that
reverend
approbation
one
gives
to
the
captains
who
lead
the
crusade
of
ideas
against
those
who
merely
sleep
and
eat
an
efficient
crusader
he
certainly
efficient
indeed
for
his
efficiency
gave
to
all
his
thoughts
a
certain
and
isolation
and
a
kind
of
hardness
to
his
mind
his
intellect
was
like
a
musician
s
instrument
with
no
he
could
think
carefully
and
cleverly
and
even
with
originality
but
never
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
his
thoughts
an
allusion
to
something
deeper
than
themselves
in
this
he
was
the
reverse
of
poetical
for
poetry
is
essentially
a
touch
from
behind
a
curtain
this
conformation
of
his
mind
helped
to
lead
him
into
all
manner
of
needless
contests
and
to
the
loss
of
this
last
parish
among
much
else
did
not
the
world
exist
for
the
sake
of
these
hard
crystalline
thoughts
with
which
he
played
as
with
so
many
bone
delighting
in
his
own
skill
and
were
not
all
who
disliked
them
many
in
this
way
it
came
about
that
sherman
s
letter
reached
howard
at
the
right
moment
now
next
to
a
new
parish
he
loved
a
new
friend
a
visit
to
london
meant
many
he
had
found
he
was
on
the
whole
a
success
at
the
beginning
of
friendships
he
at
once
wrote
an
acceptance
in
his
small
and
beautiful
handwriting
and
arrived
shortly
after
his
letter
sherman
on
receiving
him
glanced
at
his
neat
and
shining
boots
the
little
medal
at
the
and
the
hat
and
nodded
as
though
in
answer
to
an
inner
query
he
smiled
approval
at
the
slight
elegant
figure
in
its
black
clothes
at
the
satiny
hair
and
at
the
face
mobile
as
moving
waters
for
several
days
the
shermans
saw
little
of
their
guest
he
had
friends
everywhere
to
turn
into
enemies
and
acquaintances
to
turn
into
friends
his
days
passed
in
visiting
visiting
visiting
then
there
were
theatres
and
churches
to
see
and
new
clothes
to
be
bought
over
which
he
was
as
anxious
as
a
woman
finally
he
settled
down
he
passed
his
mornings
in
the
he
asked
sherman
s
leave
to
hang
on
the
walls
one
or
two
religious
pictures
without
which
he
was
not
happy
and
to
place
over
the
mantlepiece
under
the
an
ebony
crucifix
in
one
corner
of
the
room
he
laid
a
rug
neatly
folded
for
covering
his
knees
on
chilly
days
and
on
the
table
a
small
collection
of
favourite
curious
and
collection
in
which
cardinal
newman
and
bourget
chrysostom
and
flaubert
lived
together
in
perfect
friendship
early
in
his
visit
sherman
brought
him
to
the
lelands
he
was
a
success
the
sherman
and
tennis
in
the
square
howard
was
a
good
player
and
seemed
to
admire
margaret
on
the
way
home
sherman
once
or
twice
laughed
to
himself
it
was
like
the
clucking
of
a
hen
with
a
brood
of
chickens
he
told
howard
too
how
wealthy
margaret
was
said
to
be
after
this
howard
always
joined
sherman
and
margaret
at
the
tennis
sometimes
too
after
a
little
on
days
when
the
study
seemed
dull
and
lonely
and
the
unfinished
essay
on
chrysostom
more
than
usually
laborious
he
would
saunter
towards
the
square
before
his
friend
s
arrival
to
find
margaret
now
alone
now
with
an
acquaintance
or
two
about
this
time
also
press
of
work
an
unusual
thing
with
him
began
to
delay
sherman
in
town
half
an
hour
after
his
usual
time
in
the
evenings
they
often
talked
of
frankly
and
carefully
as
though
in
all
anxiety
to
describe
her
as
she
was
and
howard
with
some
enthusiasm
she
has
a
religious
vocation
he
said
once
with
a
slight
sigh
sometimes
they
played
game
that
sherman
had
recently
become
devoted
to
for
he
found
it
drew
him
out
of
himself
more
than
anything
else
howard
now
began
to
notice
a
curious
thing
sherman
grew
shabbier
and
shabbier
and
at
the
same
time
more
and
more
cheerful
this
puzzled
him
for
he
had
noticed
that
he
himself
was
not
cheerful
when
shabby
and
did
not
even
feel
upright
and
clever
when
his
hat
was
getting
old
he
also
noticed
that
when
sherman
was
talking
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
keeping
some
thought
to
himself
when
he
first
came
to
know
him
long
ago
in
ballah
he
had
noticed
occasionally
the
same
thing
and
set
it
down
to
a
kind
of
suspiciousness
and
natural
to
one
who
lived
in
such
an
place
it
seemed
more
persistent
now
however
he
is
not
well
trained
he
thought
he
is
half
a
peasant
he
has
not
the
brilliant
candour
of
the
man
of
the
all
this
while
the
mind
of
sherman
was
clucking
continually
over
its
brood
of
thoughts
ballah
was
being
constantly
suggested
to
him
the
grey
corner
of
a
cloud
slanting
its
rain
upon
cheapside
called
to
mind
by
some
remote
suggestion
the
clouds
rushing
and
falling
in
cloven
surf
on
the
seaward
steep
of
a
mountain
north
of
ballah
a
certain
street
corner
made
him
remember
an
angle
of
the
ballah
at
night
a
lantern
marking
where
the
road
was
fenced
off
for
mending
made
him
think
of
a
tinker
s
cart
with
its
swing
can
of
burning
coals
that
used
to
stop
on
market
days
at
the
corner
of
peter
s
lane
at
ballah
delayed
by
a
crush
in
the
strand
he
heard
a
faint
trickling
of
water
near
by
it
came
from
a
shop
window
where
a
little
balanced
a
wooden
ball
upon
its
point
the
sound
suggested
a
cataract
with
a
long
gaelic
name
that
leaped
crying
into
the
gate
of
the
winds
at
ballah
wandering
among
these
memories
a
footstep
went
to
and
fro
continually
and
the
figure
of
mary
carton
moved
among
them
like
a
phantom
he
was
set
dreaming
a
whole
day
by
walking
down
one
sunday
morning
to
the
border
of
the
few
hundred
yards
from
his
looking
at
the
chiswick
eyot
it
made
him
remember
an
old
of
his
the
source
of
the
river
that
passed
his
garden
at
home
was
a
certain
and
islanded
lake
whither
in
childhood
he
had
often
gone
at
the
further
end
was
a
little
islet
called
inniscrewin
its
rocky
centre
covered
with
many
bushes
rose
some
forty
feet
above
the
lake
often
when
life
and
its
difficulties
had
seemed
to
him
like
the
lessons
of
some
elder
boy
given
to
a
younger
by
mistake
it
had
seemed
good
to
dream
of
going
away
to
that
islet
and
building
a
wooden
hut
there
and
burning
a
few
years
out
rowing
to
and
fro
fishing
or
lying
on
the
island
slopes
by
day
and
listening
at
night
to
the
ripple
of
the
water
and
the
quivering
of
the
always
of
unknown
going
out
at
morning
to
see
the
island
s
edge
marked
by
the
feet
of
birds
these
pictures
became
so
vivid
to
him
that
the
world
about
howard
margaret
his
mother
to
seem
far
off
he
hardly
seemed
aware
of
anything
they
were
thinking
and
feeling
the
light
that
dazzled
him
flowed
from
the
vague
and
refracting
regions
of
hope
and
memory
the
light
that
made
howard
s
feet
unsteady
was
ever
the
too
glaring
lustre
of
life
itself
iv
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
after
the
blinds
had
been
pulled
down
and
the
gas
lighted
sherman
was
playing
chess
in
the
right
hand
against
left
howard
had
gone
out
with
a
message
to
the
lelands
he
would
often
say
is
there
any
message
i
can
deliver
for
you
i
know
how
lazy
you
are
and
will
save
you
the
a
message
was
always
found
for
him
a
pile
of
books
lent
for
sherman
s
improvement
went
home
one
by
one
look
here
said
howard
s
voice
in
the
doorway
i
have
been
watching
you
for
some
time
you
are
cheating
the
red
men
most
villainously
you
are
forcing
them
to
make
mistakes
that
the
white
men
may
win
why
a
few
such
games
would
ruin
any
man
s
moral
he
was
leaning
against
the
doorway
looking
to
sherman
s
not
too
critical
eyes
an
embodiment
of
all
that
was
and
brilliant
the
great
care
with
which
he
was
dressed
and
his
whole
manner
seemed
to
say
look
at
me
do
i
not
combine
perfectly
the
zealot
with
the
man
of
the
world
he
seemed
excited
he
had
been
talking
at
the
lelands
and
talking
well
and
felt
that
elation
which
brings
us
many
thoughts
my
dear
sherman
he
went
on
do
cease
that
game
it
is
very
bad
for
you
there
is
nobody
alive
who
is
honest
enough
to
play
a
game
of
chess
fairly
hand
against
left
we
are
so
radically
dishonest
that
we
even
cheat
ourselves
we
can
no
more
play
chess
than
we
can
think
altogether
by
ourselves
with
security
you
had
much
better
play
with
very
well
but
you
will
beat
me
i
have
not
much
practice
replied
the
other
they
reset
the
men
and
began
to
play
sherman
relied
most
upon
his
bishops
and
queen
howard
was
fondest
of
the
knights
at
first
sherman
was
the
attacking
party
but
in
his
characteristic
desire
to
scheme
out
his
game
many
moves
ahead
kept
making
slips
and
at
last
had
to
give
up
with
his
men
nearly
all
gone
and
his
king
hopelessly
cornered
howard
seemed
to
let
nothing
escape
him
when
the
game
was
finished
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
said
as
he
rolled
a
you
do
not
play
it
gave
him
satisfaction
to
feel
his
proficiency
in
many
small
arts
you
do
not
do
any
of
these
things
at
all
well
he
went
on
with
an
insolence
peculiar
to
him
when
excited
you
have
been
really
very
badly
brought
up
and
stupidly
educated
in
that
intolerable
ballah
they
do
not
understand
there
any
even
the
least
of
the
arts
of
life
they
only
believe
in
information
men
who
are
compelled
to
move
in
the
great
world
and
who
are
also
cultivated
only
value
the
personal
adaptability
how
to
dress
well
how
even
to
play
tennis
would
be
not
so
bad
at
that
by
the
by
if
you
how
to
paint
or
write
effectively
they
know
that
it
is
better
to
smoke
one
s
cigarette
with
a
certain
charm
of
gesture
than
to
have
by
heart
all
the
encyclopedias
i
say
this
not
merely
as
a
man
of
the
world
but
as
a
teacher
of
religion
a
man
when
he
rises
from
the
grave
will
take
with
him
only
the
things
that
he
is
in
himself
he
will
leave
behind
the
things
that
he
merely
possesses
learning
and
information
not
less
than
money
and
high
estate
they
will
stay
behind
with
his
house
and
his
clothes
and
his
body
a
collection
of
facts
will
no
more
help
him
than
a
collection
of
stamps
the
learned
will
not
get
into
heaven
as
readily
as
the
or
even
as
the
man
who
smokes
a
cigarette
gracefully
now
you
are
not
learned
but
you
have
been
brought
up
almost
as
badly
as
if
you
were
in
that
wretched
town
they
told
you
that
education
was
to
know
that
russia
is
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
arctic
sea
and
on
the
west
by
the
baltic
ocean
and
that
vienna
is
situated
on
the
danube
and
that
william
the
third
came
to
the
throne
in
the
year
they
have
never
taught
you
any
personal
art
even
might
have
helped
you
at
the
day
of
i
am
really
not
a
worse
than
you
i
am
only
more
there
was
a
slight
resentment
in
sherman
s
voice
the
other
noticed
it
and
said
changing
his
manner
from
the
insolent
air
of
a
young
beauty
to
a
one
which
was
wont
to
give
him
at
times
a
very
genuine
it
is
really
a
great
pity
for
you
shermans
are
a
deep
people
much
deeper
than
we
howards
we
are
like
moths
or
butterflies
on
rather
rapid
rivulets
while
you
and
yours
are
deep
pools
in
the
forest
where
the
beasts
go
to
drink
no
i
have
a
better
metaphor
your
mind
and
mine
are
two
arrows
yours
has
got
no
feathers
and
mine
has
no
metal
on
the
point
i
don
t
know
which
is
most
needed
for
right
conduct
i
wonder
where
we
are
going
to
strike
earth
i
suppose
it
will
be
all
right
some
day
when
the
world
has
gone
by
and
they
have
collected
all
the
arrows
into
one
he
went
over
to
the
mantlepiece
to
hunt
for
a
match
as
his
cigarette
had
gone
out
sherman
had
lifted
a
corner
of
the
blind
and
was
gazing
over
the
roofs
shining
from
a
recent
shower
and
thinking
how
on
such
a
night
as
this
he
had
sat
with
mary
carton
by
the
rectory
fire
listening
to
the
rain
without
and
talking
of
the
future
and
of
the
training
of
village
children
have
you
seen
miss
leland
in
her
last
new
dress
from
paris
said
howard
making
one
of
his
rapid
transitions
it
is
very
rich
in
colour
and
makes
her
look
a
little
pale
like
cecilia
she
is
wonderful
as
she
stands
by
the
piano
a
silver
cross
round
her
neck
we
have
been
talking
about
you
she
complains
to
me
she
says
you
are
a
little
barbarous
you
seem
to
look
down
on
style
and
must
forgive
on
manners
and
you
are
quite
without
small
talk
you
must
really
try
and
be
worthy
of
that
beautiful
girl
with
her
great
soul
and
religious
genius
she
told
me
quite
sadly
too
that
you
are
not
no
said
sherman
i
am
not
going
forward
i
am
at
present
trying
to
go
sideways
like
the
be
serious
answered
the
other
she
told
me
these
things
with
the
most
sad
and
touching
voice
she
makes
me
her
confidant
you
know
in
many
matters
because
of
my
wide
religious
experience
you
must
really
improve
yourself
you
must
paint
or
well
i
will
paint
or
i
am
quite
serious
sherman
try
and
be
worthy
of
her
a
soul
as
gentle
as
cecilia
she
is
very
wealthy
said
sherman
if
she
were
engaged
to
you
and
not
to
me
you
might
hope
to
die
a
howard
looked
at
him
in
a
mystified
way
and
the
conversation
dropped
presently
howard
got
up
and
went
to
his
room
and
sherman
resetting
the
began
to
play
again
and
letting
longer
and
longer
pauses
of
reverie
come
between
his
moves
played
far
into
the
morning
cheating
now
in
favour
of
the
red
men
now
in
favour
of
the
white
the
next
afternoon
howard
found
miss
leland
sitting
reading
in
an
alcove
in
her
between
a
stuffed
paroquet
and
a
blue
de
morgan
jar
as
he
was
shown
in
he
noticed
with
a
momentary
shock
that
her
features
were
quite
commonplace
then
she
saw
him
and
at
once
seemed
to
vanish
wrapped
in
an
exulting
flame
of
life
she
stood
up
flinging
the
book
on
to
the
seat
with
some
violence
i
have
been
reading
that
sweet
imitation
of
christ
and
was
just
feeling
that
i
should
have
to
become
a
theosophist
or
a
socialist
or
go
and
join
the
catholic
church
or
do
something
how
delightful
it
is
to
see
you
again
how
is
my
savage
getting
on
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
try
and
help
me
to
reform
they
talked
on
about
sherman
and
howard
did
his
best
to
console
her
for
his
shortcomings
time
would
certainly
improve
her
savage
several
times
she
gazed
at
him
with
those
large
dark
eyes
of
hers
of
which
the
pupils
seemed
larger
than
usual
they
made
him
feel
dizzy
and
clutch
tightly
the
arm
of
his
chair
then
she
began
to
talk
about
her
life
since
they
got
to
the
subject
he
never
made
a
number
of
those
confidences
which
are
so
dangerous
because
so
flattering
to
is
nothing
else
worth
living
for
but
then
men
are
so
shallow
she
had
never
found
a
nature
deep
as
her
own
she
would
not
pretend
that
she
had
not
often
been
in
love
but
never
had
any
heart
rung
back
to
her
the
true
note
as
she
spoke
her
face
quivered
with
excitement
the
exulting
flame
of
life
seemed
spreading
from
her
to
the
other
things
in
the
room
to
howard
s
eyes
it
seemed
as
though
the
bright
pots
and
stuffed
birds
and
plush
curtains
began
to
glow
with
a
light
not
of
this
glimmer
like
the
strange
and
chaotic
colours
the
mystic
blake
imagined
upon
the
scaled
serpent
of
eden
the
light
seemed
gradually
to
dim
his
past
and
future
and
to
make
pale
his
good
resolves
was
it
not
in
itself
that
which
all
men
are
seeking
and
for
which
all
else
exists
he
leant
forward
and
took
her
hand
timidly
and
doubtingly
she
did
not
draw
it
away
he
leant
nearer
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
she
gave
a
joyful
cry
and
casting
her
arms
round
his
neck
burst
out
ah
i
we
were
made
for
each
other
i
hate
sherman
he
is
an
egotist
he
is
a
beast
he
is
selfish
and
releasing
one
of
her
arms
she
struck
the
seat
with
her
hand
excitedly
and
went
on
how
angry
he
will
be
but
it
serves
him
right
how
badly
he
is
dressing
he
does
not
know
anything
about
anything
but
knew
you
were
meant
for
me
the
moment
i
saw
that
evening
howard
flung
himself
into
a
chair
in
the
empty
he
lighted
a
cigarette
it
went
out
again
he
lighted
it
again
it
went
out
i
am
a
that
good
stupid
fellow
sherman
never
to
be
jealous
he
thought
but
then
how
could
i
help
it
and
besides
it
can
not
be
a
bad
action
to
save
her
from
a
man
she
is
so
much
above
in
refinement
and
he
was
getting
into
with
himself
he
got
up
and
went
over
and
looked
at
the
photograph
of
raphael
s
madonna
which
he
had
hung
over
the
mantlepiece
how
like
margaret
s
are
her
big
eyes
vi
the
next
day
when
sherman
came
home
from
his
office
he
saw
an
envelope
lying
on
the
table
it
contained
a
letter
from
howard
saying
that
he
had
gone
away
and
that
he
hoped
sherman
would
forgive
his
treachery
but
that
he
was
hopelessly
in
love
with
miss
leland
and
that
she
returned
his
love
sherman
went
downstairs
his
mother
was
helping
the
servant
to
set
the
table
you
will
never
guess
what
has
happened
he
said
my
affair
with
margaret
is
i
can
not
pretend
to
be
sorry
john
she
replied
she
had
long
considered
miss
leland
among
accepted
things
like
the
on
the
roof
and
submitted
as
we
do
to
any
unalterable
fact
but
had
never
praised
her
or
expressed
liking
in
any
way
she
puts
belladonna
in
her
eyes
and
is
a
vixen
and
a
flirt
and
i
dare
say
her
wealth
is
all
talk
but
how
did
it
happen
her
son
was
however
too
excited
to
listen
he
went
upstairs
and
wrote
the
following
my
dear
margaret
i
congratulate
you
on
a
new
conquest
there
is
no
end
to
your
victories
as
for
me
i
bow
myself
out
with
many
sincere
wishes
for
your
happiness
and
remain
your
friend
john
having
posted
this
letter
he
sat
down
with
howard
s
note
spread
out
before
him
and
wondered
whether
there
was
anything
mean
and
in
himself
was
somewhat
untidy
he
had
often
thought
so
before
for
their
strong
friendship
was
founded
in
a
great
measure
on
mutual
contempt
but
now
immediately
added
being
in
with
the
world
he
is
much
cleverer
than
i
am
he
must
have
been
very
industrious
at
a
week
went
by
he
made
up
his
mind
to
put
an
end
to
his
london
life
he
broke
to
his
mother
his
resolve
to
return
to
ballah
she
was
delighted
and
at
once
began
to
pack
her
old
home
had
long
seemed
to
her
a
kind
of
lost
eden
wherewith
she
was
accustomed
to
contrast
the
present
when
in
time
this
present
had
grown
into
the
past
it
became
an
eden
in
turn
she
was
always
ready
for
a
change
if
the
change
came
to
her
in
the
form
of
a
return
to
something
old
others
place
their
ideals
in
the
future
she
laid
hers
in
the
past
the
only
one
this
momentous
resolution
seemed
to
surprise
was
the
old
and
deaf
servant
she
waited
with
impatience
she
would
sit
by
the
hour
on
the
corner
of
a
chair
with
a
look
of
bewildered
delight
as
the
hour
of
departure
came
near
she
sang
continually
in
a
cracked
voice
sherman
a
few
days
before
leaving
was
returning
for
the
last
time
from
his
office
when
he
saw
to
his
surprise
howard
and
miss
leland
carrying
each
a
brown
paper
bundle
he
nodded
meaning
to
pass
on
john
she
said
look
at
this
brooch
william
gave
ladder
leaning
against
the
moon
and
a
butterfly
climbing
up
it
is
it
not
sweet
we
are
going
to
visit
the
and
i
he
said
am
going
to
catch
eels
i
am
leaving
he
made
his
excuses
saying
he
had
no
time
to
wait
and
hurried
off
she
looked
after
him
with
a
mournful
glance
strange
in
anybody
who
had
exchanged
one
lover
for
another
more
favoured
poor
fellow
murmured
howard
he
is
nonsense
answered
miss
leland
somewhat
snappishly
part
sherman
returns
to
i
this
being
the
homeward
trip
ss
carried
no
cattle
but
many
passengers
as
the
sea
was
smooth
and
the
voyage
near
its
end
they
lounged
about
the
deck
in
groups
two
cattle
merchants
were
leaning
over
the
taffrail
smoking
in
appearance
they
were
something
between
betting
men
and
commercial
travellers
for
years
they
had
done
all
their
sleeping
in
steamers
and
trains
a
short
distance
from
them
a
clerk
from
liverpool
with
a
consumptive
cough
walked
to
and
fro
a
little
child
holding
his
hand
shortly
he
would
be
landed
in
a
boat
putting
off
from
the
shore
for
the
purpose
he
had
come
hoping
that
his
native
air
of
teeling
head
would
restore
him
the
little
child
was
a
strange
cheeks
ruddy
with
perfect
health
further
forward
talking
to
one
of
the
crew
was
a
man
with
a
red
face
and
slightly
unsteady
step
in
the
companion
house
was
a
governess
past
her
first
youth
very
much
afraid
of
seasickness
she
had
brought
her
luggage
up
and
heaped
it
round
her
to
be
ready
for
landing
sherman
sat
on
a
pile
of
cable
looking
out
over
the
sea
it
was
just
noon
ss
having
passed
by
tory
and
rathlin
was
approaching
the
donegal
cliffs
they
were
covered
by
a
faint
mist
which
made
them
loom
even
vaster
than
they
were
to
westward
the
sun
shone
on
a
perfectly
blue
sea
seagulls
come
out
of
the
mist
and
plunged
into
the
sunlight
and
out
of
the
sunlight
and
plunged
into
the
mist
to
the
westward
gannets
were
striking
continually
and
a
porpoise
showed
now
and
then
his
fin
and
back
gleaming
in
the
sun
sherman
was
more
perfectly
happy
than
he
had
been
for
many
a
day
and
more
ardently
thinking
all
nature
seemed
full
of
a
divine
fulfilment
everything
fulfilled
its
that
is
peace
whether
it
be
for
good
or
for
evil
for
evil
also
has
its
peace
the
peace
of
the
birds
of
prey
sherman
looked
from
the
sea
to
the
ship
and
grew
sad
upon
this
thing
crawling
slowly
along
the
sea
moved
to
and
fro
many
mournful
and
slouching
figures
he
looked
from
the
ship
to
himself
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
on
himself
on
these
moving
figures
hope
and
memory
fed
like
flames
again
his
eyes
gladdened
for
he
knew
he
had
found
his
present
he
would
live
in
his
love
and
the
day
as
it
passed
he
would
live
that
his
law
might
be
fulfilled
now
was
he
sure
of
this
truth
saints
on
the
one
hand
the
animals
on
the
other
live
in
the
moment
as
it
passes
thitherward
had
his
days
brought
him
this
was
the
one
grain
they
had
ground
to
grind
one
grain
is
sufficient
for
a
lifetime
ii
a
few
days
later
sherman
was
hurrying
through
the
town
of
ballah
it
was
saturday
and
he
passed
down
through
the
marketing
country
people
and
the
old
women
with
baskets
of
cakes
and
gooseberries
and
long
pieces
of
sugarstick
shaped
like
and
called
by
children
peggie
s
now
as
two
months
earlier
he
was
occasionally
recognized
and
greeted
and
as
before
went
on
without
knowing
his
eyes
full
of
unintelligent
sadness
because
the
mind
was
making
merry
afar
they
had
the
look
we
see
in
the
eyes
of
animals
and
dreamers
everything
had
grown
simple
his
problem
had
taken
itself
away
he
was
thinking
what
he
would
say
to
mary
carton
now
they
would
be
married
they
would
live
in
a
small
house
with
a
green
door
and
new
thatch
and
a
row
of
beehives
under
a
hedge
he
knew
where
just
such
a
house
stood
empty
the
day
before
he
and
his
mother
had
discussed
with
their
host
of
the
imperial
hotel
this
question
of
houses
they
knew
the
peculiarities
of
every
house
in
the
neighbourhood
except
two
or
three
built
while
they
were
away
all
day
sherman
and
his
mother
had
gone
over
the
merits
of
the
few
they
were
told
were
empty
she
wondered
why
her
son
had
grown
so
unpractical
once
he
was
so
easily
row
of
beehives
and
the
new
thatch
did
not
for
her
settle
the
question
she
set
it
all
down
to
miss
leland
and
the
plays
and
the
singing
and
the
belladonna
and
remembered
with
pleasure
how
many
miles
of
uneasy
water
lay
between
the
town
of
ballah
and
these
things
she
did
not
know
what
else
beside
the
row
of
beehives
and
the
new
thatch
her
son
s
mind
ran
on
as
he
walked
among
the
marketing
country
people
and
the
gooseberry
sellers
and
the
merchants
of
peggie
s
leg
and
the
boys
playing
marbles
in
odd
corners
and
the
men
in
waistcoats
with
flannel
sleeves
driving
carts
and
the
women
driving
donkeys
with
creels
of
turf
or
churns
of
milk
just
now
she
was
trying
to
remember
whether
she
used
to
buy
her
wool
for
knitting
at
miss
peters
s
or
from
macallough
s
at
the
bridge
one
or
other
sold
it
a
halfpenny
a
skein
cheaper
she
never
knew
what
went
on
inside
her
son
s
mind
she
had
always
her
own
fish
to
fry
blessed
are
the
unsympathetic
they
preserve
their
characters
in
an
iron
safe
while
the
most
of
us
poor
mortals
are
going
about
the
planet
vainly
searching
for
any
kind
of
a
shell
to
contain
us
and
evaporating
the
while
sherman
began
to
mount
the
hill
to
the
vicarage
he
was
happy
because
he
was
happy
he
began
to
run
soon
the
steepness
of
the
hill
made
him
walk
he
thought
about
his
love
for
mary
carton
seen
by
the
light
of
this
love
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
was
plain
now
he
had
found
his
centre
of
unity
his
childhood
had
prepared
him
for
this
love
he
had
been
solitary
fond
of
favourite
corners
of
fields
fond
of
going
about
alone
unhuman
like
the
birds
and
the
leaves
his
heart
empty
how
clearly
he
remembered
his
first
meeting
with
mary
they
were
both
children
at
a
school
treat
they
watched
the
fire
balloon
ascend
and
followed
it
a
little
way
over
the
fields
together
what
friends
they
became
growing
up
together
reading
the
same
books
thinking
the
same
thoughts
as
he
came
to
the
door
and
pulled
at
the
great
hanging
iron
bell
handle
the
fire
balloon
reascended
in
his
heart
surrounded
with
cheers
and
laughter
iii
he
kept
the
servant
talking
for
a
moment
or
two
before
she
went
for
miss
carton
the
old
rector
she
told
him
was
getting
less
and
less
able
to
do
much
work
old
age
had
come
almost
suddenly
upon
him
he
seldom
moved
from
the
fireside
he
was
getting
more
and
more
once
lately
he
had
brought
his
umbrella
into
the
more
and
more
did
he
leave
all
things
to
his
mary
carton
and
her
younger
sisters
when
the
servant
had
gone
sherman
looked
round
the
somewhat
gloomy
room
in
the
window
hung
a
canary
in
a
painted
cage
outside
was
a
narrow
piece
of
shaded
ground
between
the
window
and
the
rectory
wall
the
laurel
and
holly
bushes
darkened
the
window
a
good
deal
on
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
were
evangelistic
books
with
gilded
covers
round
the
mirror
over
the
mantlepiece
were
stuck
various
parish
announcements
thrust
between
the
glass
and
the
gilding
on
a
small
side
table
was
a
copper
how
familiar
everything
seemed
to
sherman
only
the
room
seemed
smaller
than
it
did
three
years
before
and
close
to
the
table
with
the
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
before
the
was
a
new
threadbare
patch
in
the
carpet
sherman
recalled
how
in
this
room
he
and
mary
carton
had
sat
in
winter
by
the
fire
building
castles
in
the
air
for
each
other
so
deeply
meditating
was
he
that
she
came
in
and
stood
unnoticed
beside
him
john
she
said
at
last
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
you
so
soon
again
are
you
doing
well
in
london
i
have
left
are
you
married
then
you
must
introduce
me
to
your
i
shall
never
be
married
to
miss
what
she
has
preferred
friend
william
howard
i
have
come
here
to
tell
you
something
he
went
and
stood
close
to
her
and
took
her
hand
tenderly
i
have
always
been
very
fond
of
you
often
in
london
when
i
was
trying
to
think
of
another
kind
of
life
i
used
to
see
this
fireside
and
you
sitting
beside
it
where
we
used
to
sit
and
talk
about
the
future
he
held
her
hand
in
both
you
will
be
my
wife
you
do
not
love
me
john
she
answered
drawing
herself
away
you
have
come
to
me
because
you
think
it
your
duty
i
have
had
nothing
but
duty
all
my
listen
he
said
i
was
very
miserable
i
invited
howard
to
stay
with
us
one
morning
i
found
a
note
on
the
table
to
say
that
margaret
had
accepted
him
and
i
have
come
here
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
never
cared
for
any
one
he
found
himself
speaking
hurriedly
as
though
anxious
to
get
the
words
said
and
done
with
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
done
ill
in
this
matter
of
miss
leland
he
had
not
before
thought
of
mind
had
always
been
busy
with
other
things
mary
carton
looked
at
him
wonderingly
john
she
said
at
last
did
you
ask
howard
to
stay
with
you
on
purpose
to
get
him
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
leland
or
to
give
you
an
excuse
for
breaking
off
your
engagement
as
you
knew
he
flirted
with
every
one
margaret
seems
very
fond
of
him
i
think
they
are
made
for
each
other
he
answered
did
you
ask
him
to
london
on
purpose
well
i
will
tell
you
he
faltered
i
was
very
miserable
i
had
drifted
into
this
engagement
i
don
t
know
how
margaret
glitters
and
glitters
and
glitters
but
she
is
not
of
my
kind
i
suppose
i
thought
like
a
fool
i
should
marry
some
one
who
was
rich
i
found
out
soon
that
i
loved
nobody
but
you
i
got
to
be
always
thinking
of
you
and
of
this
town
then
i
heard
that
howard
had
lost
his
curacy
and
asked
him
up
i
just
left
them
alone
and
did
not
go
near
margaret
much
i
knew
they
were
made
for
each
other
do
not
let
us
talk
of
them
he
continued
eagerly
let
us
talk
about
the
future
i
will
take
a
farm
and
turn
farmer
i
dare
say
my
uncle
will
not
give
me
anything
when
he
dies
because
i
have
left
his
office
he
will
call
me
a
ne
and
say
i
would
squander
it
but
you
and
will
get
married
will
we
not
we
will
be
very
happy
he
went
on
pleadingly
you
will
still
have
your
charities
and
i
shall
be
busy
with
my
farm
we
will
surround
ourselves
with
a
wall
the
world
will
be
on
the
outside
and
on
the
inside
we
and
our
peaceful
wait
she
said
i
will
give
you
your
answer
and
going
into
the
next
room
returned
with
several
bundles
of
letters
she
laid
them
on
the
table
some
were
white
and
new
some
slightly
yellow
with
time
john
she
said
growing
very
pale
here
are
all
the
letters
you
ever
wrote
me
from
your
earliest
she
took
one
of
the
large
candles
from
the
mantlepiece
and
lighting
it
placed
it
on
the
hearth
sherman
wondered
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
it
i
will
tell
you
she
went
on
what
i
had
thought
to
carry
to
the
grave
unspoken
i
have
loved
you
for
a
long
time
when
you
came
and
told
me
you
were
going
to
be
married
to
another
i
forgave
you
for
man
s
love
is
like
the
wind
and
i
prayed
that
god
might
bless
you
she
leant
down
over
the
candle
her
face
pale
and
contorted
with
emotion
all
these
letters
after
that
grew
very
sacred
since
we
were
never
to
be
married
they
grew
a
portion
of
my
life
separated
from
everything
and
every
something
apart
and
holy
i
them
all
and
arranged
them
in
little
bundles
according
to
their
dates
and
tied
them
with
thread
now
i
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
any
she
held
the
bundle
of
letters
in
the
flame
he
got
up
from
his
seat
she
motioned
him
away
imperiously
he
looked
at
the
flame
in
a
bewildered
way
the
letters
fell
in
little
burning
fragments
about
the
hearth
it
was
all
like
a
terrible
dream
he
watched
those
steady
fingers
hold
letter
after
letter
in
the
candle
flame
and
watched
the
candle
burning
on
like
a
passion
in
the
grey
daylight
of
universal
existence
a
draught
from
under
the
door
began
blowing
the
ash
about
the
room
the
voice
you
tried
to
marry
a
rich
girl
you
did
not
love
her
but
knew
she
was
rich
you
tired
of
her
as
you
tire
of
so
many
things
and
behaved
to
her
most
wrongly
most
wickedly
and
treacherously
when
you
were
jilted
you
came
again
to
me
and
to
the
idleness
of
this
little
town
we
had
all
hoped
great
things
of
you
you
seemed
good
and
i
loved
you
all
along
he
cried
if
you
would
marry
me
we
would
be
very
happy
i
loved
you
all
along
he
helplessly
several
times
over
the
bird
shook
a
shower
of
seed
on
his
shoulder
he
picked
one
of
them
from
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
mechanically
i
loved
you
all
you
have
done
no
duty
that
came
to
you
you
have
tired
of
everything
you
should
cling
to
and
now
you
have
come
to
this
little
town
because
here
is
idleness
and
the
last
letter
lay
in
ashes
on
the
hearth
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
replaced
it
among
the
photographs
on
the
mantlepiece
and
stood
there
as
calm
as
a
portion
of
the
marble
john
our
friendship
is
has
been
burnt
in
the
he
started
forward
his
mind
full
of
appeals
with
despair
on
his
lips
gathered
incoherent
words
she
will
be
happy
with
howard
they
were
made
for
each
other
i
slipped
into
it
i
always
thought
i
should
marry
some
one
who
was
rich
i
never
loved
any
one
but
you
i
did
not
know
i
loved
you
at
first
i
thought
about
you
always
you
are
the
root
of
my
steps
were
heard
outside
the
door
at
the
end
of
a
passage
mary
carton
went
to
the
door
and
called
the
steps
turned
and
came
nearer
with
a
great
effort
sherman
controlled
himself
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
slight
girl
of
twelve
came
into
the
room
a
strong
smell
of
garden
mould
rose
from
a
basket
in
her
hands
sherman
recognized
the
child
who
had
given
him
tea
that
evening
in
the
schoolhouse
three
years
before
have
you
finished
weeding
the
carrots
said
mary
carton
yes
then
you
are
to
weed
the
small
bed
under
the
by
the
do
not
go
yet
child
this
is
sherman
sit
down
a
the
child
sat
down
on
the
corner
of
a
chair
with
a
scared
look
in
her
eyes
suddenly
she
oh
what
a
lot
of
burnt
paper
yes
i
have
been
burning
some
old
i
think
said
john
i
will
go
without
a
word
of
farewell
he
went
out
almost
groping
his
way
he
had
lost
the
best
of
all
the
things
he
held
dear
twice
he
had
gone
through
the
fire
the
first
time
worldly
ambition
left
him
on
the
second
love
an
hour
before
the
air
had
been
full
of
singing
and
peace
that
was
resonant
like
joy
now
he
saw
standing
before
his
eden
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
all
the
hope
he
had
ever
gathered
about
him
had
taken
itself
off
and
the
naked
soul
shivered
iv
the
road
under
his
feet
felt
gritty
and
barren
he
hurried
away
from
the
town
it
was
late
afternoon
trees
cast
bands
of
shadow
across
the
road
he
walked
rapidly
as
if
pursued
about
a
mile
to
the
south
of
the
town
he
came
on
a
large
wood
bordering
the
road
and
surrounding
a
deserted
house
some
local
rich
man
once
lived
there
now
it
was
given
over
to
a
caretaker
who
lived
in
two
rooms
in
the
back
part
men
were
at
work
cutting
down
trees
in
two
or
three
parts
of
the
wood
many
places
were
quite
bare
a
mass
of
covered
well
and
the
wreckage
of
castle
that
had
been
roofed
with
green
for
centuries
lifted
themselves
up
bare
as
anatomies
the
sight
intensified
by
some
strange
sympathy
his
sorrow
and
he
hurried
away
as
from
a
thing
accursed
of
god
the
road
led
to
the
foot
of
a
mountain
topped
by
a
cairn
supposed
in
popular
belief
to
be
the
grave
of
maeve
mab
of
the
fairies
and
considered
by
antiquarians
to
mark
the
place
where
certain
prisoners
were
executed
in
legendary
times
as
sacrifices
to
the
moon
he
began
to
climb
the
mountain
the
sun
was
on
the
rim
of
the
sea
it
stayed
there
without
moving
for
as
he
ascended
he
saw
an
circle
of
water
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
cairn
the
sun
sank
under
the
sea
the
donegal
headlands
mixed
with
the
surrounding
blue
the
stars
grew
out
of
heaven
sometimes
he
got
up
and
walked
to
and
fro
hours
passed
the
stars
the
streams
down
in
the
valley
the
wind
moving
among
the
boulders
the
various
unknown
creatures
rustling
in
the
these
were
contained
within
themselves
fulfilling
their
law
content
to
be
alone
content
to
be
with
others
having
the
peace
of
god
or
the
peace
of
the
birds
of
prey
he
only
did
not
fulfil
his
law
something
that
was
not
he
that
was
not
nature
that
was
not
god
had
made
him
and
her
he
loved
its
tools
hope
memory
tradition
conformity
had
been
laying
waste
their
lives
as
he
thought
this
the
night
seemed
to
crush
him
with
its
purple
foot
hour
followed
hour
at
midnight
he
started
up
hearing
a
faint
murmur
of
clocks
striking
the
hour
in
the
distant
town
his
face
and
hands
were
wet
with
tears
his
clothes
saturated
with
dew
he
turned
homeward
hurriedly
flying
from
the
terrible
firmament
what
had
this
glimmering
and
silence
to
do
with
luxurious
present
he
belonged
to
the
past
and
the
future
with
pace
somewhat
slackened
because
of
the
furze
he
came
down
into
the
valley
along
the
northern
horizon
moved
a
perpetual
dawn
travelling
eastward
as
the
night
advanced
once
as
he
passed
a
marsh
near
a
a
number
of
small
birds
rose
chirruping
from
where
they
had
been
clinging
among
the
reeds
once
standing
still
for
a
moment
where
two
roads
crossed
on
a
he
looked
out
over
the
dark
fields
a
white
stone
rose
in
the
middle
of
a
field
a
score
of
yards
in
front
of
him
he
knew
the
place
well
it
was
an
ancient
he
looked
at
the
stone
and
suddenly
filled
by
that
terror
of
the
darkness
children
feel
began
again
his
hurried
walk
he
ballah
by
the
southern
side
in
passing
he
looked
at
the
rectory
to
his
surprise
a
light
burned
in
the
he
stood
still
the
dawn
was
brightening
towards
the
east
but
all
round
him
was
darkness
seeming
the
more
intense
to
his
eyes
for
their
being
fresh
from
the
unshaded
fields
in
the
midst
of
this
darkness
shone
the
lighted
window
he
went
over
to
the
gate
and
looked
in
the
room
was
empty
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
he
noticed
a
white
figure
standing
close
to
the
gate
the
latch
creaked
and
the
gate
moved
slowly
on
its
hinges
john
said
a
trembling
voice
i
have
been
praying
and
a
light
has
come
to
me
i
wished
you
to
be
go
away
and
do
something
in
the
world
you
did
badly
and
my
poor
pride
was
wounded
you
do
not
know
how
much
i
had
hoped
from
you
but
it
was
all
pride
and
foolishness
you
love
me
i
ask
no
more
we
need
each
other
the
rest
is
with
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
began
caressing
it
we
have
been
shipwrecked
our
goods
have
been
cast
into
the
something
in
her
voice
told
of
the
emotion
that
divides
the
love
of
woman
from
the
love
of
man
she
looked
upon
him
whom
she
loved
as
full
of
a
helplessness
that
needed
protection
a
reverberation
of
the
feeling
of
the
mother
for
the
child
at
the
breast
dhoya
i
long
ago
before
the
earliest
stone
of
the
pyramids
was
laid
before
the
bo
tree
of
buddha
unrolled
its
first
leaf
before
a
japanese
had
painted
on
a
temple
wall
the
horse
that
every
evening
descended
and
trampled
the
before
the
ravens
of
thor
had
eaten
their
first
worm
together
there
lived
a
man
of
giant
stature
and
of
giant
strength
named
dhoya
one
evening
fomorian
galleys
had
entered
the
bay
of
the
red
cataract
now
the
bay
of
ballah
and
there
deserted
him
though
he
rushed
into
the
water
and
hurled
great
stones
after
them
they
were
out
of
reach
from
earliest
childhood
the
fomorians
had
held
him
captive
and
compelled
him
to
toil
at
the
oar
but
when
his
strength
had
come
his
fits
of
passion
made
him
a
terror
to
all
on
board
sometimes
he
would
tear
the
seats
of
the
galley
from
their
places
at
others
drive
the
rowers
to
some
corner
where
trembling
they
would
watch
him
pacing
to
and
fro
till
the
passion
left
him
the
demons
they
said
have
made
him
their
so
they
enticed
him
on
shore
he
having
on
his
head
a
mighty
stone
pitcher
to
fill
with
water
and
deserted
him
when
the
last
sail
had
dropped
over
the
rim
of
the
world
he
rose
from
where
he
had
flung
himself
down
on
the
sands
and
paced
through
the
forests
eastward
after
a
time
he
reached
that
lake
among
the
mountains
where
in
later
times
dermot
drove
down
four
stakes
and
made
thereon
a
platform
with
four
flags
in
the
centre
for
a
hearth
and
placed
over
all
a
roof
of
wicker
and
skins
and
hid
his
grania
islanded
thereon
still
eastward
he
went
what
is
now
bulban
on
one
side
cope
s
mountain
on
the
other
until
at
last
he
threw
himself
at
full
length
in
a
deep
cavern
and
slept
henceforward
he
made
this
cavern
his
lair
issuing
forth
to
hunt
the
deer
or
the
bears
or
the
mountain
oxen
slowly
the
years
went
by
his
fits
of
fury
growing
more
and
more
frequent
though
there
was
no
one
but
his
own
shadow
to
rave
against
when
his
fury
was
on
him
even
the
bats
and
owls
and
the
brown
toads
that
crept
out
of
the
grass
at
twilight
would
hide
the
bats
and
owls
and
the
brown
toads
these
he
had
made
his
friends
and
let
them
crawl
and
perch
about
him
for
at
times
he
would
be
very
gentle
and
they
too
were
sullen
and
outcasts
from
they
knew
not
what
but
most
of
all
things
placid
and
beautiful
feared
him
he
would
watch
for
hours
hidden
in
the
leaves
to
reach
his
hand
out
slowly
and
carefully
at
last
and
seize
and
crush
some
glittering
halcyon
slowly
the
years
went
by
and
human
face
he
never
saw
but
sometimes
when
the
gentle
mood
was
on
him
and
it
was
twilight
a
presence
seemed
to
float
invisibly
by
him
and
sigh
softly
and
once
or
twice
he
awoke
from
sleep
with
the
sensation
of
a
finger
having
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
forehead
and
would
mutter
a
prayer
to
the
moon
before
turning
to
sleep
moon
that
glimmered
through
the
door
of
his
cave
o
moon
he
would
say
that
wandereth
in
the
blue
cave
more
white
than
the
beard
of
partholan
whose
years
were
five
hundred
sullen
and
solitary
sleeping
only
on
the
floor
of
the
sea
keep
me
from
the
evil
spirits
of
the
islands
of
the
lake
southward
beyond
the
mountains
and
the
evil
spirits
of
the
caves
northward
beyond
the
mountains
and
the
evil
spirits
who
wave
their
torches
by
the
mouth
of
the
river
eastward
beyond
the
valley
and
the
evil
spirits
of
the
pools
westward
beyond
the
mountains
and
i
will
offer
you
a
bear
and
a
deer
in
full
horn
o
solitary
of
the
cave
divine
and
if
any
have
done
you
wrong
i
will
avenge
gradually
however
he
began
to
long
for
this
mysterious
touch
at
times
he
would
make
journeys
into
distant
parts
and
once
the
mountain
oxen
gathered
together
proud
of
their
overwhelming
numbers
and
their
white
horns
and
followed
him
with
great
bellowing
westward
he
being
laden
with
their
tallest
to
his
cave
and
would
have
gored
him
but
pacing
into
a
pool
of
the
sea
to
his
shoulders
he
saw
them
thunder
away
losing
him
in
the
darkness
the
place
where
he
stood
is
called
pooldhoya
to
this
day
so
the
years
went
slowly
by
and
ever
deeper
and
deeper
came
his
moodiness
and
more
often
his
fits
of
wrath
once
in
his
gloom
he
paced
the
forests
for
miles
now
this
way
now
that
until
returning
in
the
twilight
he
found
himself
standing
on
a
cliff
southward
of
the
lake
that
was
southward
of
the
mountains
the
moon
was
rising
the
sound
of
the
swaying
of
reeds
floated
from
beneath
and
the
twittering
of
the
flocks
of
who
love
to
cling
on
the
moving
stems
it
was
the
hour
of
votaries
he
turned
to
the
moon
then
hurriedly
gathered
a
pile
of
leaves
and
branches
and
making
a
fire
cast
thereon
wild
strawberries
and
the
fruit
of
the
quicken
tree
as
the
smoke
floated
upwards
a
bar
of
faint
purple
clouds
drifted
over
the
moon
s
refusal
of
the
sacrifice
hurrying
through
the
surrounding
woods
he
found
an
owl
sleeping
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
and
returning
cast
him
on
the
fire
still
the
clouds
gathered
again
he
searched
the
woods
this
time
a
badger
was
uselessly
cast
among
the
flames
time
after
time
he
came
and
went
sometimes
returning
immediately
with
some
live
thing
at
others
not
till
the
fire
had
almost
burnt
itself
out
deer
wild
swine
birds
all
to
no
purpose
higher
and
higher
he
piled
the
burning
branches
the
flames
and
the
smoke
waved
and
circled
like
the
lash
of
a
giant
s
whip
gradually
the
nearer
islands
passed
the
rosy
colour
on
to
their
more
distant
brethren
the
of
the
furthest
reed
beds
disturbed
amid
their
sleep
must
have
wondered
at
the
red
gleam
reflected
in
each
other
s
eyes
useless
his
toil
the
clouds
covered
the
moon
s
face
more
and
more
until
when
the
long
fire
lash
was
at
its
brightest
they
drowned
her
completely
in
a
surge
of
unbroken
mist
raging
against
the
fire
he
scattered
with
his
staff
the
burning
branches
and
trampled
in
his
fury
the
sacrificial
embers
beneath
his
feet
suddenly
a
voice
in
the
surrounding
darkness
called
him
softly
by
name
he
turned
for
years
no
articulate
voice
had
sounded
in
his
ears
it
seemed
to
rise
from
the
air
just
beneath
the
verge
of
the
precipice
holding
by
a
hazel
bush
he
leaned
out
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
him
the
form
of
a
beautiful
woman
floated
faintly
before
him
but
changed
as
he
watched
to
a
little
cloud
of
vapour
and
from
the
nearest
of
the
haunted
islands
there
came
assuredly
a
whiff
of
music
then
behind
him
in
the
forest
said
the
voice
dhoya
my
he
rushed
in
pursuit
something
white
was
moving
before
him
he
stretched
out
his
hand
it
was
only
a
mass
of
white
campion
trembling
in
the
morning
breeze
for
an
ashen
morning
was
just
touching
the
mists
on
the
eastern
mountains
beginning
suddenly
to
tremble
with
supernatural
fear
dhoya
paced
homewards
everything
was
changed
dark
shadows
seemed
to
come
and
go
and
elfin
chatter
to
pass
upon
the
breeze
but
when
he
reached
the
shelter
of
the
pine
woods
all
was
still
as
of
old
he
slackened
his
speed
those
solemn
soothed
him
with
their
vast
and
yet
each
one
alone
once
or
twice
when
in
some
glade
further
than
usual
from
its
kind
arose
some
larger
than
the
rest
he
paused
with
bowed
head
to
mutter
an
uncouth
prayer
to
that
dark
outlaw
but
when
issuing
once
more
as
he
neared
his
cave
into
the
region
of
mountain
ash
and
hazel
the
voices
seemed
again
to
come
and
go
and
the
shadows
to
circle
round
him
and
once
a
voice
said
he
imagined
in
accents
faint
and
soft
as
falling
dew
dhoya
my
but
a
few
yards
from
the
cave
all
grew
suddenly
silent
ii
slower
and
slower
he
went
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
bewildered
by
all
that
was
happening
a
few
feet
from
the
cave
he
stood
still
counting
aimlessly
the
round
spots
of
light
made
by
the
beams
slanting
through
trees
that
hid
with
their
greenness
as
in
the
centre
of
the
sea
that
hollow
rock
as
over
and
over
he
counted
them
he
heard
first
with
the
ear
only
then
with
the
mind
also
a
footstep
going
to
and
fro
within
the
cave
lifting
his
eyes
he
saw
the
same
figure
seen
on
the
figure
of
a
woman
beautiful
and
young
her
dress
was
white
save
for
a
border
of
feathers
dyed
the
fatal
red
of
the
spirits
she
had
arranged
in
one
corner
the
spears
and
in
the
other
the
brushwood
and
branches
used
for
the
fire
and
spread
upon
the
ground
the
skins
and
now
began
pulling
vainly
at
the
great
stone
pitcher
of
the
fomorians
suddenly
she
saw
him
and
with
a
burst
of
wild
laughter
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
crying
dhoya
i
have
left
my
world
far
off
my
the
floor
of
the
lake
they
are
dancing
and
singing
and
on
the
islands
of
the
lake
always
happy
always
young
always
without
change
i
have
left
them
for
thee
dhoya
for
they
can
not
love
only
the
changing
and
moody
and
angry
and
weary
can
love
i
am
beautiful
love
me
dhoya
do
you
hear
me
i
left
the
places
where
they
dance
dhoya
for
thee
for
long
she
poured
out
a
tide
of
words
he
answering
at
first
little
then
more
and
more
as
she
melted
away
the
silence
of
so
many
inarticulate
years
and
all
the
while
she
gazed
on
him
with
eyes
no
ardour
could
rob
of
the
mild
and
mysterious
melancholy
that
watches
us
from
the
eyes
of
of
unhuman
reveries
many
days
passed
over
these
strangely
wedded
ones
sometimes
when
he
asked
her
do
you
love
me
she
would
answer
i
do
not
know
but
i
long
for
your
love
often
at
twilight
returning
from
hunting
he
would
find
her
bending
over
a
stream
that
flowed
near
to
the
cave
decking
her
hair
with
feathers
and
reddening
her
lips
with
the
juice
of
a
wild
berry
he
was
very
happy
secluded
in
that
deep
forest
hearing
the
faint
murmurs
of
the
western
sea
they
seemed
to
have
outlived
change
but
change
is
everywhere
with
the
tides
and
the
stars
fastened
to
her
wheel
every
blood
drop
in
their
lips
every
cloud
in
the
sky
every
leaf
in
the
world
changed
a
little
while
they
brushed
back
their
hair
and
kissed
all
things
change
save
only
the
fear
of
change
and
yet
for
his
hour
dhoya
was
happy
and
as
full
of
dreams
as
an
old
man
or
an
dreams
wander
nearest
to
the
grave
and
the
cradle
once
as
he
was
returning
home
from
hunting
by
the
northern
edge
of
the
lake
at
the
hour
when
the
owls
cry
to
each
other
it
is
time
to
be
abroad
and
the
last
flutter
of
the
wind
has
died
away
leaving
under
every
haunted
island
an
image
legible
to
the
least
hazel
branch
there
suddenly
stood
before
him
a
slight
figure
at
the
edge
of
the
narrow
dark
against
the
glowing
water
dhoya
drew
nearer
it
was
a
man
leaning
on
his
on
his
head
a
small
red
cap
his
spear
was
slender
and
tipped
with
shining
metal
the
spear
of
dhoya
of
wood
one
end
pointed
and
hardened
in
the
fire
the
stranger
silently
raised
that
slender
spear
and
thrust
at
dhoya
who
parried
with
his
pointed
staff
for
a
long
while
they
fought
the
last
vestige
of
sunset
passed
away
and
the
stars
came
out
underneath
them
the
feet
of
dhoya
beat
up
the
ground
but
the
feet
of
the
other
as
he
rushed
hither
and
thither
matching
his
agility
with
the
mortal
s
mighty
strength
made
neither
shadow
nor
footstep
on
the
sands
dhoya
was
wounded
and
growing
weary
a
little
when
the
other
leaped
away
and
crouching
down
by
the
water
you
have
carried
away
by
some
spell
unknown
the
most
beautiful
of
our
who
have
neither
laughter
nor
singing
restore
her
dhoya
and
go
dhoya
answered
him
no
word
and
the
other
rose
and
again
thrust
at
him
with
the
spear
they
fought
to
and
fro
upon
the
sands
until
the
dawn
touched
with
olive
the
distant
sky
and
then
his
anger
fit
long
absent
fell
on
dhoya
and
he
closed
with
his
enemy
and
threw
him
and
put
his
knee
on
his
chest
and
his
hands
on
his
throat
and
would
have
crushed
all
life
out
of
him
when
lo
he
held
beneath
his
knee
no
more
than
a
bundle
of
reeds
nearing
home
in
the
early
morning
he
heard
the
voice
he
loved
full
moody
is
my
love
and
sad
his
moods
bow
low
his
sombre
crest
i
hold
him
dearer
than
the
glad
and
he
shall
slumber
on
my
breast
my
love
hath
many
an
evil
mood
ill
words
for
all
things
soft
and
fair
i
hold
him
dearer
than
the
good
my
fingers
feel
his
amber
hair
no
tender
wisdom
floods
the
eyes
that
watch
me
with
their
suppliant
i
hold
him
dearer
than
the
wise
and
for
him
make
me
wise
and
and
when
she
saw
him
she
cried
an
old
mortal
song
heard
floating
from
a
tent
of
skin
as
we
rode
i
and
mine
through
a
at
from
that
day
she
was
always
either
singing
wild
and
melancholy
songs
or
else
watching
him
with
that
gaze
of
animal
reverie
once
he
asked
how
old
are
you
a
thousand
years
for
i
am
i
am
so
little
to
you
he
went
on
and
you
are
so
much
to
and
sunset
tranquility
and
speech
and
am
i
so
much
she
said
say
it
many
times
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
brighten
and
her
breast
heaved
with
joy
often
he
would
bring
her
the
beautiful
skins
of
animals
and
she
would
walk
to
and
fro
on
them
laughing
to
feel
their
softness
under
her
feet
sometimes
she
would
pause
and
ask
suddenly
will
you
weep
for
me
when
we
have
parted
and
he
would
answer
i
will
die
then
and
she
would
go
on
rubbing
her
feet
to
and
fro
in
the
soft
skin
and
so
dhoya
grew
tranquil
and
gentle
and
change
seemed
still
to
have
forgotten
them
having
so
much
on
her
hands
the
stars
rose
and
set
watching
them
smiling
together
and
the
tides
ebbed
and
flowed
bringing
mutability
to
all
save
them
but
always
everything
changes
save
only
the
fear
of
change
iii
one
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
inner
portion
of
the
cave
watching
through
the
opening
the
paling
of
the
sky
and
the
darkening
of
the
leaves
and
counting
the
budding
stars
dhoya
suddenly
saw
stand
before
him
the
dark
outline
of
him
he
fought
on
the
lake
sand
and
heard
at
the
same
instant
his
companion
sigh
the
stranger
approached
a
little
and
said
dhoya
we
have
fought
heretofore
and
now
i
have
come
to
play
chess
against
thee
for
well
thou
knowest
dear
to
the
perfect
warrior
after
war
is
i
know
it
answered
dhoya
and
when
we
have
played
dhoya
we
will
name
the
do
not
play
whispered
his
companion
at
his
side
but
dhoya
being
filled
with
his
anger
fit
at
the
sight
of
his
enemy
answered
i
will
play
and
i
know
well
the
stake
you
mean
and
i
name
this
for
mine
that
i
may
again
have
my
knee
on
your
chest
and
my
hands
on
your
throat
and
that
you
will
not
again
change
into
a
bundle
of
wet
his
companion
lay
down
on
a
skin
and
began
to
cry
a
little
dhoya
felt
sure
of
winning
he
had
often
played
in
his
boyhood
before
the
time
of
his
anger
fits
with
his
masters
of
the
galley
and
besides
he
could
always
return
to
his
hands
and
his
weapons
once
more
now
the
floor
of
the
cave
was
of
smooth
white
sand
brought
from
the
in
his
great
fomorian
pitcher
to
make
it
soft
for
his
beloved
to
walk
upon
before
it
had
been
as
it
now
is
of
rough
clay
on
this
sand
the
stranger
marked
out
with
his
a
and
marked
with
rushes
crossed
and
recrossed
each
alternate
square
fixing
each
end
of
the
rush
in
the
sand
until
a
complete
board
was
finished
of
white
and
green
squares
and
then
drew
from
a
bag
large
of
mingled
wood
and
silver
two
or
three
would
have
made
an
armful
for
a
child
standing
each
at
his
end
they
began
to
play
the
game
did
not
last
long
no
matter
how
carefully
dhoya
played
each
move
went
against
him
at
last
leaping
back
from
the
board
he
cried
i
have
lost
the
two
spirits
were
standing
together
at
the
entrance
dhoya
seized
his
spear
but
slowly
the
figures
began
to
fade
first
a
star
and
then
the
leaves
showed
through
their
forms
soon
all
had
vanished
away
then
realizing
his
loss
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
rolling
hither
and
thither
roared
like
a
wild
beast
all
night
long
he
lay
on
the
ground
and
all
the
next
day
till
nightfall
he
had
crumbled
his
staff
unconsciously
between
his
fingers
into
small
pieces
and
now
full
of
dull
rage
arose
and
went
forth
westward
in
a
ravine
of
the
northern
mountain
he
came
on
the
tracks
of
wild
horses
soon
one
passed
him
fearlessly
knowing
nothing
of
man
the
pointed
end
of
his
staff
he
still
carried
he
drove
it
deep
in
the
flank
making
a
long
wound
sending
the
horse
rushing
with
short
screams
down
the
mountain
other
horses
passed
him
one
by
one
driven
southward
by
a
cold
wind
laden
with
mist
arisen
in
the
towards
the
end
of
the
ravine
stood
one
black
and
huge
the
leader
of
the
herd
dhoya
leaped
on
his
back
with
a
loud
cry
that
sent
a
raven
circling
from
the
neighbouring
cliff
and
the
horse
after
vainly
seeking
to
throw
him
rushed
off
towards
the
over
the
heights
of
the
mountains
where
the
mists
floated
the
moon
clear
sometimes
of
the
flying
clouds
from
low
down
in
the
cast
a
pale
and
mutable
light
making
their
shadow
rise
before
them
on
the
mists
as
though
they
pursued
some
colossal
demon
sombre
on
his
black
charger
then
leaving
the
heights
they
rushed
wildly
down
that
valley
where
in
far
later
times
dermot
hid
in
a
deep
cavern
his
grania
and
passed
the
stream
where
muadhan
their
savage
servant
caught
fish
for
them
on
a
hook
baited
with
a
quicken
berry
on
over
the
plains
on
northward
mile
after
mile
the
wild
gigantic
horse
leaping
cliff
and

in
his
terrible
race
on
until
the
mountains

rose
before
these

the

in
their

not
whither
he
went
or
why
he
rode

loosened
by
the
hoofs
rumbling
down
into
the
far
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
sea
a
thousand
feet
below
him
then
fixing
his
eyes
thereon
and
using
the
as
a
goad
he
roused
his
black
horse
into
redoubled
speed
and
with
a
wild
leap
horse
and
rider
plunged
headlong
into
the
western
sea
