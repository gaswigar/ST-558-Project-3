the
morals
of
marcus
ordeyne
by
william
locke
part
i
chapter
i
for
reasons
which
will
be
given
later
i
sit
down
here
in
verona
to
write
the
history
of
my
extravagant
adventure
i
shall
formulate
and
expand
the
rough
notes
in
my
diary
which
lies
open
before
me
and
i
shall
begin
with
a
happy
afternoon
in
may
six
months
ago
may
is
the
seventh
anniversary
of
my
release
from
captivity
i
will
note
it
every
year
in
my
diary
with
a
sigh
of
unutterable
thanksgiving
for
seven
long
blessed
years
have
i
been
free
from
the
degrading
influences
of
jones
minor
and
the
first
book
of
euclid
some
men
find
the
modern
english
boy
stimulating
and
the
old
egyptian
humorous
such
are
the
born
schoolmasters
and
schoolmasters
like
poets
non
what
i
was
born
passes
my
ingenuity
to
fathom
certainly
not
a
schoolmaster
and
my
many
years
of
apprenticeship
did
not
make
me
one
they
only
turned
me
into
an
automaton
feared
by
myself
bantered
by
my
colleagues
and
sometimes
tolerated
by
the
boys
seven
years
ago
the
lawyer
s
letter
came
the
post
used
to
arrive
just
before
first
school
i
opened
the
letter
in
the
and
sat
down
at
my
desk
sick
with
horror
the
awful
wholesale
destruction
of
my
relatives
paralysed
me
my
form
must
have
seen
by
my
ghastly
face
that
something
had
happened
for
contrary
to
their
usual
practice
they
sat
thirty
of
them
in
stony
silence
waiting
for
me
to
begin
the
lesson
as
far
as
i
remember
anything
they
waited
the
whole
hour
the
lesson
over
i
passed
along
the
cloister
on
my
way
to
my
rooms
i
overheard
one
of
my
urchins
clattering
in
front
of
me
shout
to
another
i
m
sure
he
s
got
the
sack
turning
round
he
perceived
me
and
grew
as
red
as
a
i
laughed
aloud
the
boy
s
yell
was
a
clarion
announcement
from
the
seventh
heaven
i
got
the
should
never
teach
him
quadratic
equations
again
i
should
turn
my
back
forever
upon
those
hateful
walls
and
still
more
abominated
and
i
was
not
leaving
my
prison
as
i
had
done
once
or
twice
before
in
order
to
continue
my
servitude
elsewhere
i
was
free
i
could
go
out
into
the
sunshine
and
look
my
in
the
face
free
from
the
haunting
demoralising
sense
of
incapacity
i
was
free
until
that
urchin
s
shriek
i
had
not
realised
it
my
teeth
chattered
with
the
thrill
i
was
fortunately
out
of
school
the
second
hour
i
employed
most
of
it
in
balancing
myself
a
perfectly
reasonable
creature
i
visited
the
chief
he
was
a
chubby
rotund
man
with
a
circular
body
and
a
circular
visage
and
he
wore
great
circular
gold
spectacles
he
looked
like
a
figure
in
the
third
book
of
euclid
but
his
eyes
sparkled
like
bits
of
glass
in
the
sun
well
ordeyne
he
inquired
looking
up
from
letters
to
parents
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
accept
my
resignation
said
i
i
would
like
you
to
release
me
at
come
come
things
are
not
as
bad
as
all
that
said
he
kindly
i
looked
stupidly
at
him
for
a
moment
of
course
i
know
you
ve
got
one
or
two
troublesome
forms
he
continued
then
i
winced
his
conjecture
hurt
me
horribly
oh
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
my
incompetence
i
interrupted
what
is
it
then
my
grandfather
two
uncles
two
nephews
and
a
valet
were
drowned
a
day
or
two
ago
in
the
mediterranean
i
answered
calmly
i
have
since
been
struck
by
the
crudity
of
this
announcement
it
took
my
chief
s
breath
away
i
deeply
sympathise
with
you
he
said
at
last
thank
you
said
i
a
terrible
catastrophe
no
wonder
it
has
upset
you
horrible
six
living
human
beings
three
generations
of
men
that
s
just
it
said
i
three
generations
of
my
family
swept
away
leaving
me
now
at
the
head
of
at
this
moment
the
chief
s
wife
came
into
the
library
with
the
morning
paper
in
her
hand
on
seeing
me
she
rushed
forward
have
you
had
bad
news
yes
is
it
in
the
paper
i
was
coming
to
show
my
husband
the
name
is
an
uncommon
one
i
wondered
if
they
might
be
relatives
of
i
bowed
acquiescence
the
chief
looked
at
the
paragraph
below
his
wife
s
indicating
thumb
then
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
too
had
suffered
a
seachange
i
had
no
idea
he
said
why
now
now
you
are
sir
marcus
ordeyne
it
sounds
idiotic
doesn
t
it
said
i
with
a
smile
but
i
suppose
i
and
so
came
my
release
from
captivity
i
was
profoundly
affected
by
the
awful
disaster
but
it
would
be
sheer
hypocrisy
if
i
said
that
i
felt
personal
grief
i
knew
none
of
the
dead
of
whom
i
verily
believe
the
valet
was
the
worthiest
man
my
grandfather
and
uncles
had
ignored
my
existence
not
a
helping
hand
had
they
stretched
out
to
my
widowed
mother
in
her
poverty
when
one
kindly
touch
would
have
meant
all
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
a
lovable
race
the
ordeynes
what
my
father
the
youngest
son
was
like
i
have
no
idea
as
he
died
when
i
was
two
years
old
but
my
mother
who
was
somewhat
stern
and
puritanical
spoke
of
him
very
much
as
she
would
have
spoken
of
the
prophet
joel
had
he
been
a
personal
acquaintance
seven
years
have
i
been
a
free
man
feeling
at
peace
with
all
the
world
i
called
this
afternoon
on
my
aunt
jessica
ordeyne
who
has
borne
me
no
malice
for
stepping
into
the
place
that
should
have
been
the
inheritance
of
her
husband
and
of
her
son
rather
has
she
devised
to
adopt
me
to
guide
my
ambitions
and
to
point
out
my
duties
as
the
head
of
the
house
if
i
refuse
to
be
adopted
avoid
ambitions
and
disclaim
duties
the
fault
lies
not
with
her
she
is
a
worldly
woman
of
and
having
begun
to
dye
her
hair
in
the
peroxide
of
hydrogen
era
has
not
the
curiosity
to
abandon
the
practice
and
see
what
colour
will
result
i
wish
i
could
like
her
i
can
t
she
purrs
some
day
i
feel
she
will
scratch
she
received
me
graciously
my
dear
marcus
at
last
didn
t
you
know
i
have
been
in
town
ever
since
easter
no
said
i
i
am
afraid
i
didn
which
was
true
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
i
would
have
asked
you
to
dinner
but
you
will
never
come
as
for
at
home
cards
i
never
dream
of
sending
them
to
you
it
is
a
waste
of
precious
you
might
have
written
me
a
nice
little
letter
about
nothing
at
all
i
suggested
for
you
to
say
what
is
that
woman
worrying
me
with
her
silly
letters
for
i
know
what
you
men
she
looked
arch
this
is
precisely
what
i
should
have
said
as
i
am
not
an
inventive
liar
i
could
only
smile
feebly
i
am
never
at
my
ease
with
aunt
jessica
i
am
not
the
kind
of
person
to
afford
her
entertainment
i
do
not
belong
to
her
world
of
opulence
and
if
even
i
desired
it
which
the
gods
forbid
my
means
would
not
enable
me
to
make
the
necessary
display
my
uncle
thinking
to
retrieve
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
title
amassed
enormous
wealth
as
a
company
promoter
while
i
on
whom
the
title
has
descended
am
perfectly
contented
with
its
fallen
fortunes
i
have
scarcely
a
thought
or
taste
in
common
with
my
aunt
in
fact
i
must
bore
her
exceedingly
yet
she
hides
her
boredom
beneath
a
radiant
countenance
and
leads
me
to
understand
that
my
society
gives
her
inexpressible
joy
i
wonder
why
she
is
always
me
i
resent
it
a
man
of
forty
does
not
need
the
counsels
of
an
elderly
woman
destitute
of
intellect
i
believe
there
are
some
women
who
are
firmly
convinced
that
their
sheer
sex
has
imbued
them
with
all
the
qualities
of
genius
my
aunt
tackled
me
on
the
subject
of
marriage
i
ought
to
marry
i
asked
why
it
appeared
it
was
every
man
s
duty
from
what
point
of
view
i
asked
the
mere
propagation
of
the
human
race
or
the
providing
of
a
superfluous
young
woman
with
a
means
of
livelihood
if
it
is
the
former
then
in
my
opinion
there
are
too
many
people
in
the
world
already
and
if
the
latter
i
m
afraid
i
m
not
sufficiently
you
are
so
laughed
my
aunt
i
was
not
aware
of
being
the
least
bit
funny
but
seriously
she
continued
you
she
is
a
woman
who
has
an
irritating
way
of
speaking
in
italics
are
you
aware
that
if
you
have
no
son
the
title
will
become
extinct
and
if
it
does
i
cried
who
on
this
earth
will
care
a
i
am
growing
tired
of
the
title
at
first
it
was
rather
amusing
now
it
appears
it
is
registered
in
heaven
s
chancery
and
hedged
about
with
divine
ordinances
only
the
other
day
an
unknown
parson
requested
me
to
open
a
church
bazaar
and
i
gathered
he
had
received
his
instructions
direct
from
the
almighty
why
every
one
would
care
exclaimed
my
aunt
genuinely
shocked
it
would
be
monstrous
you
owe
it
to
your
descendants
as
well
as
to
your
ancestors
besides
she
added
with
apparent
irrelevance
a
man
in
your
position
ought
to
live
up
to
i
do
said
i
just
up
to
now
you
are
pretending
you
don
t
understand
me
you
ought
to
marry
money
i
smiled
and
shook
my
head
i
don
t
think
my
aunt
likes
me
to
smile
and
shake
my
head
for
i
saw
a
flicker
in
her
eyes
no
my
dear
aunt
emphatically
no
it
would
be
comfortless
if
i
kissed
it
it
would
be
cold
if
i
put
my
arms
round
it
it
would
be
full
of
sharp
edges
which
would
hurt
if
i
tried
to
get
any
emotion
out
of
it
it
would
only
what
do
you
want
then
nothing
but
if
i
must
let
it
be
plain
flesh
and
cannibal
said
my
aunt
we
both
laughed
but
you
can
have
plenty
of
flesh
and
blood
with
money
as
well
for
the
asking
she
insisted
and
thereupon
my
two
cousins
dora
and
gwendolen
entered
the
drawingroom
and
interrupted
the
conversation
they
are
both
bouncing
girls
in
the
early
twenties
they
ride
and
shoot
and
bicycle
and
golf
and
dance
and
the
elder
writes
little
stories
for
the
magazines
as
i
do
none
of
these
things
i
am
convinced
they
regard
me
as
a
poor
sort
of
creature
when
they
hand
me
a
cup
of
tea
i
almost
expect
them
to
pat
me
on
the
head
and
say
good
dog
i
am
long
lean
stooping
hawknosed
i
have
not
the
breezy
air
of
the
jolly
young
stockbrokers
they
are
in
the
habit
of
meeting
they
rather
alarm
me
moreover
they
have
managed
to
rear
a
colossal
pile
of
wholly
incorrect
information
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
and
are
addicted
to
letting
chunks
of
it
fall
about
one
s
ears
this
stuns
me
rendering
conversation
difficult
as
i
had
not
seen
dora
since
her
return
from
rome
where
she
had
spent
the
early
spring
i
asked
in
some
trepidation
for
her
impressions
before
i
could
collect
myself
i
was
listening
to
a
lecture
on
peter
s
she
told
me
it
was
built
by
michael
angelo
i
suggested
that
some
credit
might
be
given
to
bramante
not
to
speak
of
rosellino
baldassare
peruzzi
and
the
two
san
gallo
s
oh
said
my
young
lady
with
a
superb
air
of
omniscience
it
was
all
michael
angelo
s
design
others
only
tinkered
away
at
it
after
receiving
this
brickbat
i
took
my
leave
to
console
myself
i
looked
up
during
the
evening
michael
angelo
s
noble
letter
about
bramante
one
can
not
deny
says
he
that
bramante
was
as
excellent
in
architecture
as
any
one
has
been
from
the
ancients
to
now
he
placed
the
first
stone
of
peter
s
not
full
of
confusion
but
clear
neat
and
luminous
and
isolated
all
round
in
such
a
way
that
it
injured
no
part
of
the
palace
and
was
held
to
be
a
beautiful
thing
as
is
still
apparent
in
such
a
way
that
any
one
who
has
departed
from
the
said
order
of
bramante
as
san
gallo
has
done
has
departed
from
the
michael
angelo
did
not
like
san
gallo
neither
did
he
like
was
his
senior
by
thirty
this
makes
his
appreciation
of
the
elder
s
work
all
the
more
generous
tinkered
away
at
it
indeed
may
i
spent
all
the
morning
at
work
by
the
open
window
i
have
a
small
house
in
lingfield
terrace
on
the
north
side
of
the
regent
s
park
so
that
my
on
the
first
floor
has
a
southern
aspect
it
has
been
warm
and
sunny
for
the
past
few
days
and
the
elms
and
across
the
road
are
beginning
to
riot
in
their
green
bravery
as
if
intoxicated
with
the
golden
wine
of
spring
my
french
window
is
flung
wide
open
and
on
the
balcony
a
triangular
bit
of
sunlight
creeps
round
as
the
morning
advances
my
is
drawn
up
to
the
window
i
am
busy
over
the
first
section
of
my
history
of
renaissance
morals
for
which
i
think
my
notes
are
completed
i
have
a
delicious
sense
of
isolation
from
the
world
away
over
those
is
a
faint
purpurine
pall
and
below
it
lies
london
with
its
strife
and
its
misery
its
wickedness
and
its
vanity
twenty
minutes
would
take
me
into
the
heart
of
it
and
if
i
chose
i
could
be
as
struggling
as
wretched
as
much
imbued
with
wickedness
and
vanity
as
anybody
i
could
gamble
on
the
stock
exchange
or
play
the
muddy
game
of
politics
or
hawk
my
precious
title
for
sale
among
the
young
women
of
london
society
my
aunt
jessica
once
told
me
that
london
was
at
my
feet
i
am
quite
content
that
it
should
stay
there
i
have
much
the
same
nervous
dread
of
it
as
i
have
of
an
angry
sea
breaking
in
surf
on
the
shingle
if
i
ventured
out
in
it
i
should
be
tossed
hither
and
thither
and
broken
on
the
rocks
and
i
should
perish
i
prefer
to
stand
aloof
and
watch
if
i
had
a
little
more
of
daring
in
my
nature
i
might
achieve
something
i
am
afraid
i
am
but
a
waster
in
the
world
s
factory
but
kind
fate
instead
of
pitching
me
on
the
has
preserved
me
perhaps
has
set
me
under
a
glass
case
in
her
own
museum
as
a
curiosity
well
i
am
happy
in
my
shelter
i
was
interrupted
in
my
writing
by
the
entrance
of
my
cook
and
housekeeper
antoinette
she
was
sorry
to
disturb
me
but
did
monsieur
like
sorrel
she
was
preparing
some
a
l
for
lunch
and
stenson
my
man
had
informed
her
that
it
was
disgusting
stuff
and
that
monsieur
would
not
eat
it
antoinette
said
i
go
and
inform
stenson
that
as
he
looks
after
my
outside
so
do
you
look
after
my
inside
and
that
i
have
implicit
confidence
in
both
of
you
in
your
respective
spheres
of
but
does
monsieur
like
sorrel
antoinette
inquired
anxiously
i
adore
it
even
said
i
and
antoinette
made
her
exit
in
triumph
what
a
reverential
care
french
women
have
for
the
insides
of
their
masters
at
times
it
is
pathetic
before
now
i
have
thrown
dainty
morsels
which
i
could
not
eat
into
the
fire
so
as
to
avoid
hurting
antoinette
s
feelings
i
came
across
her
three
years
ago
in
a
tiny
hostelry
in
a
tiny
town
in
the
loire
district
she
cooked
the
dinner
and
conversed
about
it
afterwards
so
touchingly
that
we
soon
became
united
in
bonds
of
the
closest
affection
suddenly
some
money
was
stolen
antoinette
accused
was
dismissed
without
notice
i
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
of
the
thief
a
suspicion
which
was
afterwards
completely
justified
and
indignantly
championed
antoinette
s
cause
but
antoinette
coming
from
a
village
some
eighty
miles
away
was
a
stranger
and
an
alien
i
was
her
only
friend
it
ended
in
my
inviting
her
to
come
to
england
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
refuge
of
the
downtrodden
and
oppressed
and
become
my
housekeeper
she
accepted
with
smiles
and
tears
and
they
were
great
big
smiles
that
went
into
creases
all
over
her
fat
red
face
forming
runnels
for
the
great
big
tears
which
dropped
off
at
unexpected
angles
she
was
alone
in
the
world
her
only
son
had
died
during
his
military
service
in
madagascar
although
her
man
was
dead
the
law
would
not
regard
her
as
a
widow
because
she
had
never
been
married
and
therefore
refused
to
exempt
her
only
son
ne
jeune
qu
une
fois
n
pas
monsieur
she
said
in
extenuation
of
her
early
fault
and
she
added
was
as
brave
a
fellow
and
as
devoted
a
son
as
if
i
had
been
married
by
the
i
waved
my
hand
in
deprecation
and
told
her
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
the
della
scalas
supreme
lords
of
verona
for
many
generations
were
every
man
jack
of
them
so
parented
even
william
the
conqueror
cried
antoinette
consoled
and
he
became
emperor
of
germany
he
and
bismarck
antoinette
s
historical
sense
is
rudimentary
i
have
not
tried
since
to
develop
it
when
i
brought
my
victim
of
foreign
tyranny
to
lingfield
terrace
stenson
i
believe
nearly
fainted
he
is
the
correctest
of
english
valets
and
his
only
vice
i
believe
is
the
accordion
on
which
he
plays
jaunty
when
i
am
out
of
the
house
when
he
had
recovered
he
asked
me
respectfully
how
they
were
to
understand
each
other
i
explained
that
he
would
either
have
to
learn
french
or
teach
antoinette
english
what
they
have
done
i
gather
is
to
invent
a
nightmare
of
a
in
which
they
appear
to
hold
amicable
converse
now
and
again
they
have
differences
of
opinion
as
over
my
taste
for
a
l
but
on
the
whole
their
relations
are
harmonious
and
she
keeps
him
in
a
naturally
she
feeds
the
brute
the
stimulated
by
my
call
yesterday
on
one
aunt
by
marriage
led
my
footsteps
this
afternoon
to
the
house
of
the
other
ralph
ordeyne
she
is
of
a
different
type
from
her
being
a
devout
roman
catholic
and
since
the
terrible
affliction
of
two
years
ago
has
concerned
herself
more
deeply
than
ever
in
the
affairs
of
her
religion
she
lives
in
a
gloomy
little
house
in
a
sunless
kensington
only
my
cousin
rosalie
was
at
home
she
gave
me
tea
made
with
tepid
water
and
talked
about
the
earl
s
court
exhibition
which
she
had
not
visited
and
a
new
novel
of
which
she
had
vaguely
heard
i
tried
in
vain
to
infuse
some
life
into
the
conversation
i
don
t
believe
she
is
interested
in
anything
she
even
spoke
lukewarmly
of
farm
street
i
pity
her
intensely
she
is
thin
thirty
colourless
bosomless
i
should
say
she
was
passionless
a
predestined
spinster
she
has
never
drunk
hot
tea
or
lived
in
the
sun
or
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
i
remember
once
at
my
wit
s
end
for
talk
telling
her
the
old
story
of
theodore
hook
accosting
a
pompous
stranger
on
the
street
with
the
polite
request
that
he
might
know
whether
he
was
anybody
in
particular
she
said
without
a
smile
yes
it
was
astonishing
how
rude
some
people
could
and
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
gave
her
the
name
of
rosalie
mine
might
just
as
well
have
called
me
hercules
or
puck
she
told
me
that
her
mother
intended
to
ask
me
to
dine
with
them
one
evening
next
week
when
was
i
free
i
chose
thursday
oddly
enough
i
enjoy
dining
there
although
we
are
on
the
most
formal
terms
not
having
got
beyond
the
sir
marcus
and
mrs
but
both
mother
and
daughter
are
finely
bred
gentlewomen
and
one
meets
few
oh
very
very
few
among
the
ladies
of
i
reached
home
about
six
and
found
a
telegram
awaiting
me
can
t
give
you
dinner
cook
in
an
impossible
condition
come
i
must
confess
to
a
sigh
of
relief
i
am
fond
of
judith
and
sorry
for
her
domestic
infelicities
though
why
she
should
maintain
that
alcoholized
wretch
in
her
kitchen
passes
my
comprehension
if
there
is
one
thing
women
do
not
understand
it
is
the
selection
the
ordering
and
the
treatment
of
domestic
servants
the
mere
man
manages
much
better
but
that
aside
antoinette
has
spoiled
me
for
judith
s
cook
s
cookery
i
breathed
a
little
sigh
of
content
and
summoned
stenson
to
inform
him
that
i
would
dine
at
home
a
great
package
of
books
from
a
bookseller
arrived
during
dinner
among
them
were
the
nine
volumes
of
pietro
gianone
s
civile
del
regno
di
a
copy
of
which
i
ought
to
have
possessed
long
ago
it
is
dedicated
to
the
most
puissant
and
felicitous

charles

the

is
there
a
living
soul
in

universe
who
has
a
spark
of
admiration
for
this
most
puissant
and
most
felicitous
monarch
crowned
by
god
emperor
and
king
of
the
greater
part
of
europe
and
docked
of
most
of
his
pretensions
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
we
only
remember
the
person
by
his
pragmatic
sanction
and
otherwise
his
personality

left
in
history
not
the
remotest
trace

himself
out
for
a
couple
of
pages
before
this
prodigy
whom
he
lovingly
calls
as
who
should
say
raffaelo
or
giordano
and
now
where
in
the
hearts
of
men
lingers
sir
arthur
duck
for
one
thing
he
had
a
bad
name
our
english
sense
of
humour
revolts
from
making
a
popular
hero
of
a
man
called
duck
yet
we
made
one
of
drake
but
there
was
something
masculine
about
the
latter
in
fact
everything
i
am
afraid
it
was
rather
late
when
i
got
to
judith
chapter
ii
may
i
wonder
whether
i
should
be
happier
now
if
i
had
lived
in
a
garret
in
the
brave
days
when
i
was
if
i
had
undergone
the
lessons
of
misery
with
the
attendant
compensations
of
folle
maitresse
de
francs
amis
et
l
amour
des
and
had
mounted
my
six
flights
of
stairs
i
lived
modestly
it
is
true
but
never
for
a
moment
was
i
doubtful
as
to
my
next
meal
and
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
creature
comforts
of
the
respectable
classes
never
did
lisette
pin
her
shawl
across
my
window
sometimes
nowadays
i
almost
wish
she
had
i
never
dreamed
of
glory
love
pleasure
madness
or
spent
my
lifetime
in
a
moment
like
the
singer
of
the
immortal
song
often
the
weary
moments
seemed
a
lifetime
and
now
that
i
am
forty
it
is
too
late
a
boon
companions
of
whom
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
have
none
would
drive
me
crazy
with
their
intolerable
heartiness
i
once
spent
an
evening
at
the
savage
club
as
for
the
as
a
concomitant
of
my
existence
she
transcends
imagination
what
are
you
thinking
of
asked
judith
i
was
thinking
how
the
dans
un
grenier
qu
on
est
bien
a
vingt
ans
principle
would
have
worked
in
my
own
case
i
answered
truthfully
for
the
above
reflections
had
been
passing
through
my
mind
judith
laughed
you
in
a
garret
why
you
haven
t
got
a
temperament
i
suppose
i
haven
t
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
beranger
omitted
that
from
his
list
of
attendant
compensations
that
s
the
difference
between
us
she
added
after
a
pause
i
have
a
temperament
and
you
haven
i
hope
you
find
it
a
great
it
is
ten
times
more
uncomfortable
than
a
conscience
it
is
the
bane
of
one
s
why
be
so
proud
of
having
it
you
wouldn
t
understand
if
i
told
you
said
judith
i
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
and
gazed
meditatively
at
the
rain
which
swept
the
uninspiring
little
street
judith
lives
in
tottenham
mansions
in
the
purlieus
of
the
tottenham
court
road
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
is
a
and
on
summer
evenings
one
can
sit
by
the
open
windows
and
breathe
in
the
fumes
of
beer
and
whisky
and
listen
to
the
sweet
tuneless
strains
of
itinerant
musicians
when
my
new
fortunes
enabled
me
to
give
the
dear
woman
just
the
little
help
that
allowed
her
to
move
into
a
more
commodious
flat
she
had
the
many
mansions
of
london
to
choose
from
why
she
insisted
on
this
abominable
locality
i
could
never
understand
it
isn
t
as
if
the
flat
were
particularly
cheap
indeed
the
fact
of
its
being
situated
over
a
seems
to
enhance
the
rent
she
said
she
liked
the
shape
of
the
knocker
and
the
pattern
of
the
bathroom
taps
i
dimly
perceive
that
it
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
temperament
it
always
seems
to
rain
when
we
propose
an
outing
together
this
is
the
fourth
time
since
easter
i
remarked
we
had
planned
a
sedate
country
jaunt
but
as
the
day
was
pouring
wet
we
remained
at
home
perhaps
this
is
the
way
the
has
of
expressing
his
disapproval
of
us
said
judith
why
should
he
disapprove
i
asked
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
ended
in
a
shiver
i
am
chilled
my
dear
girl
i
cried
why
on
earth
haven
t
you
lit
the
fire
the
last
time
i
lit
it
you
said
the
room
was
but
then
it
was
beautiful
blazing
sunshine
you
illogical
woman
i
exclaimed
searching
my
pockets
for
a
i
struck
a
match
to
apply
it
to
the
fire
i
had
to
kneel
by
her
chair
she
stretched
out
her
hand
she
has
delicate
white
hands
with
slender
fingers
and
lightly
touched
my
head
how
long
have
we
known
each
other
she
asked
about
eight
and
how
long
shall
we
go
on
as
long
as
you
like
said
i
intent
on
the
fire
judith
withdrew
her
hand
i
knelt
on
the
hearthrug
until
the
merry
blaze
and
crackle
of
the
wood
assured
me
of
successful
effort
these
are
capital
grates
i
said
cheerfully
drawing
a
comfortable
to
the
front
of
the
fire
excellent
she
replied
in
a
tone
devoid
of
interest
there
was
a
long
silence
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
great
charms
of
human
intercourse
is
there
not
a
legend
that
tennyson
and
carlyle
spent
the
most
enjoyable
evenings
of
their
lives
enveloped
in
impenetrable
silence
and
one
on
each
side
of
the
hob
a
sort
of
whistlerian
nocturne
of
golden
fog
i
offered
judith
a
cigarette
she
declined
it
with
a
shake
of
the
head
i
lit
one
myself
and
leaning
back
contentedly
in
my
chair
watched
her
face
in
most
people
would
call
her
plain
i
can
t
make
up
my
mind
on
the
point
she
is
what
is
termed
a
negative
blonde
that
is
to
say
one
with
very
fair
hair
in
marvellous
abundance
it
is
one
of
her
beauties
a
sallow
complexion
and
deep
violet
eyes
her
face
is
thin
a
little
worn
that
of
the
woman
who
has
suffered
temperament
again
her
mouth
now
as
she
looks
into
the
new
noisy
flames
is
drawn
down
at
the
corners
her
figure
is
slight
but
graceful
she
has
pretty
feet
one
protruded
from
her
skirt
and
a
slipper
dangled
from
the
tip
at
last
it
fell
off
i
knew
it
would
she
has
a
craze
for
the
minimum
of
material
in
slippers
about
an
inch
of
leather
i
suppose
it
s
leather
from
the
toe
i
picked
the
vain
thing
up
and
balanced
it
again
on
her
will
you
do
that
eight
years
hence
said
judith
my
dear
as
i
ve
done
it
eight
thousand
times
the
last
eight
years
i
suppose
i
shall
i
replied
laughing
i
m
a
creature
of
you
may
marry
god
forbid
i
ejaculated
some
pretty
fresh
i
abominate
pretty
fresh
girls
i
would
just
as
soon
talk
to
a
baby
in
a
the
women
men
are
crazy
to
marry
are
not
always
those
they
particularly
delight
to
converse
with
my
friend
said
judith
i
lit
another
cigarette
i
think
the
sex
feminine
has
marriage
on
the
brain
i
exclaimed
somewhat
heatedly
my
aunt
jessica
was
worrying
me
about
it
the
day
before
yesterday
as
if
it
were
any
concern
of
hers
judith
laughed
below
her
breath
and
called
me
a
simpleton
why
i
asked
because
you
haven
t
got
a
this
was
a
foolish
answer
having
no
bearing
on
the
question
i
told
her
so
she
replied
that
she
was
years
older
than
i
and
had
learned
the
eternal
relevance
of
all
things
i
pointed
out
that
she
was
years
younger
how
many
have
you
had
in
your
life
real
wild
pulsating
eternity
in
an
hour
that
s
blake
i
murmured
i
m
aware
of
it
answer
my
it
s
a
silly
it
isn
t
the
next
time
you
see
a
female
baby
in
a
perambulator
take
off
your
hat
i
am
afraid
i
am
clumsy
at
repartee
and
the
next
time
you
engage
a
cook
my
dear
judith
said
i
send
for
a
mere
she
coloured
up
i
dissolved
myself
in
apologies
her
wounded
susceptibilities
required
careful
healing
the
situation
was
somewhat
odd
she
had
not
scrupled
to
attack
the
innermost
weaknesses
of
my
character
and
yet
when
i
retaliated
by
a
hit
at
externals
she
was
deeply
hurt
and
made
me
feel
a
ruffianly
blackguard
i
really
think
if
lisette
had
pinned
up
that
curtain
i
should
have
learned
something
more
about
female
human
nature
but
judith
is
the
only
woman
i
have
known
intimately
all
my
life
long
and
sometimes
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
ever
know
her
i
told
her
so
once
she
answered
if
you
loved
me
you
would
know
very
likely
she
was
right
honestly
speaking
i
don
t
love
judith
i
am
accustomed
to
her
she
is
a
lady
born
and
bred
she
is
an
educated
woman
and
takes
quite
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
renaissance
indeed
she
has
a
subtler
appreciation
of
the
venetian
school
of
painting
than
i
have
she
first
opened
my
eyes
in
italy
to
the
beauties
as
a
gorgeous
colourist
of
palma
vecchio
in
his
second
or
giorgionesque
manner
she
is
in
every
way
a
sympathetic
and
entertaining
companion
going
deeper
to
the
roots
of
human
instinct
i
find
she
represents
to
me
so
chance
has
willed
it
the
which
must
complement
masculinity
in
order
to
produce
normal
existence
but
as
for
the
uns
no
it
would
not
attract
me
hence
out
of
my
sphere
i
could
commit
an
immortal
folly
for
no
woman
who
ever
made
this
planet
more
lustrous
to
its
bruderspharen
i
don
t
understand
judith
it
doesn
t
very
greatly
matter
many
things
i
don
t
understand
the
spiritual
attitude
towards
himself
for
example
of
the
intelligent
juggler
who
expends
his
life
s
energies
in
balancing
a
cue
and
three
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
but
i
know
that
judith
understands
me
and
therein
lies
the
advantage
i
gain
from
our
intimacy
she
gauges
to
an
absurdly
subtle
degree
the
depth
of
my
affection
she
is
really
an
incomparable
woman
so
many
insist
upon
predilection
masquerading
as
consuming
passion
there
is
nothing
theatrical
about
judith
yet
she
appeared
a
little
touchy
moody
unsettled
she
broke
another
pleasant
spell
of
fireside
silence
that
followed
expiation
of
my
offence
by
suddenly
calling
my
name
yes
said
i
inquiringly
i
want
to
tell
you
something
please
promise
me
you
won
t
be
my
dear
judith
said
i
my
great
and
imperial
namesake
in
whose
meditations
i
have
always
found
ineffable
comfort
tells
me
this
if
anything
external
vexes
you
take
notice
that
it
is
not
the
thing
which
disturbs
you
but
your
notion
about
it
which
notion
you
may
dismiss
at
once
if
you
please
so
i
promise
to
dismiss
all
my
notions
of
your
disturbing
communication
and
not
to
be
if
there
is
one
platitudinist
i
dislike
more
than
another
it
is
marcus
aurelius
said
judith
i
laughed
it
was
very
comfortable
to
sit
before
the
fire
which
protested
in
a
fire
s
cheery
human
way
against
the
depression
of
the
murky
world
outside
and
to
banter
judith
i
can
quite
understand
it
i
said
a
man
sucks
in
the
consolations
of
philosophy
a
woman
solaces
herself
with
i
can
do
neither
she
replied
changing
her
attitude
with
an
exaggerated
shaking
down
of
skirts
if
i
could
i
shouldn
t
want
to
go
go
away
i
echud
yes
you
mustn
t
be
vexed
with
me
i
haven
t
got
a
cook
no
one
would
have
thought
it
from
the
luncheon
you
gave
me
my
the
alcoholized
domestic
by
the
way
was
sent
out
bag
and
baggage
last
evening
when
she
was
sober
enough
to
walk
and
so
it
is
a
convenient
opportunity
judith
continued
ignoring
my
compliment
and
rightly
so
for
as
soon
as
it
had
been
uttered
i
was
struck
by
an
uneasy
conviction
that
she
had
herself
disturbed
the
french
caterers
in
the
tottenham
court
road
from
their
sabbath
repose
in
order
to
provide
me
with
food
i
can
shut
up
the
flat
without
any
fuss
i
am
never
happy
at
the
beginning
of
a
london
season
i
know
i
m
silly
she
went
on
hurriedly
if
i
could
stand
your
dreadful
marcus
aurelius
i
might
be
wiser
i
don
t
mind
the
rest
of
the
year
but
in
the
season
everybody
is
in
town
people
i
used
to
know
and
mix
with
i
meet
them
in
the
streets
and
they
cut
me
and
it
hurts
and
so
i
want
to
get
away
somewhere
by
myself
when
i
get
sick
of
solitude
i
ll
come
one
of
her
quick
graceful
movements
brought
her
to
her
knees
by
my
side
she
caught
my
hand
for
pity
s
sake
marcus
say
that
you
understand
why
it
i
said
i
have
been
a
blatant
egoist
all
the
afternoon
judith
i
didn
t
guess
of
course
i
if
you
didn
t
it
would
be
impossible
for
have
no
doubt
said
i
softly
and
i
kissed
her
hand
i
came
into
her
life
when
she
counted
it
as
over
and
done
with
at
eight
and
twenty
and
was
patiently
undergoing
premature
interment
in
a
small
pension
in
rome
how
long
her
patience
would
have
lasted
i
can
not
say
if
circumstances
had
been
different
what
would
have
happened
is
the
most
futile
of
speculations
what
did
happen
was
the
drifting
together
of
us
two
bits
of
flotsam
and
our
keeping
together
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
were
no
forces
urging
us
apart
she
was
past
all
care
for
social
sanctions
her
sacred
cap
of
good
repute
having
been
flung
over
the
windmills
long
before
and
i
friendless
unit
in
a
world
of
shadows
why
should
i
have
rejected
the
one
warm
hand
that
was
held
out
to
me
as
i
said
to
her
this
afternoon
why
should
the
disapprove
i
pay
him
the
compliment
of
presuming
that
he
is
a
deity
when
my
fortune
came
she
remarked
i
am
glad
i
am
not
free
if
i
were
you
would
want
to
marry
me
and
that
would
be
the
divine
sound
sense
of
the
dear
woman
honour
would
compel
the
offer
its
acceptance
would
bring
disaster
marriage
has
two
aspects
the
one
a
social
contract
a
of
protection
maintenance
position
and
what
not
for
a
of
the
various
services
that
may
be
conveniently
epitomized
in
the
phrase
mensa
et
the
other
the
only
possible
existence
for
two
beings
whose
passionate
mutual
attraction
demands
the
perfect
fusion
of
their
two
existences
into
a
common
life
now
to
this
passionate
attraction
i
have
never
become
and
having
no
temperament
thank
heaven
shall
never
become
a
party
before
the
turbulence
therein
involved
i
stand
affrighted
as
i
do
before
london
or
the
deep
sea
i
once
read
an
epitaph
in
a
german
churchyard
i
will
awake
o
christ
when
thou
callest
me
but
let
me
sleep
awhile
for
i
am
very
has
the
human
soul
ever
so
poignantly
expressed
its
craving
for
quietude
i
fancy
i
should
have
been
a
heart
s
friend
of
that
dead
man
who
like
myself
loved
the
cool
and
quiet
shadow
and
was
not
allowed
to
enjoy
it
in
this
world
i
may
not
get
the
calm
i
desire
but
at
any
rate
my
existence
shall
not
be
turned
upside
down
by
mad
passion
for
a
woman
as
for
the
aspect
of
marriage
i
want
no
better
housekeeper
than
antoinette
and
my
having
no
guests
does
not
need
a
lady
to
grace
its
foot
i
have
no
craving
to
add
to
the
population
if
children
were
brought
into
the
world
by
an
act
of
pure
reason
alone
says
schopenhauer
would
the
human
race
continue
to
exist
would
not
a
man
rather
have
so
much
sympathy
with
the
coming
generation
as
to
spare
it
the
burden
of
existence
or
at
any
rate
not
take
it
upon
himself
to
impose
that
burden
upon
it
in
cold
blood
by
bringing
children
into
the
world
by
means
of
a
marriage
of
convenience
i
should
be
imposing
the
burden
of
existence
upon
them
in
cold
blood
i
agree
with
schopenhauer
and
the
dreadful
bond
of
such
a
marriage
to
have
in
the
closest
physical
and
moral
propinquity
for
one
hundred
and
hours
out
of
the
week
each
hour
surcharged
with
an
obligatory
exchange
of
responsibilities
interests
sacrifices
of
every
kind
a
being
who
is
not
the
utter
brother
of
my
thoughts
and
sister
of
my
dreams
no
never
grand
non
au
grand
jamais
judith
is
an
incomparable
woman
but
she
is
not
the
utter
brother
of
my
thoughts
and
the
sister
of
my
dreams
nor
am
i
of
hers
but
the
comradeship
she
gives
me
is
as
food
and
drink
and
my
affection
fulfils
a
need
in
her
nature
the
delicate
adjustment
of
reciprocals
is
our
sanction
marriage
were
it
possible
would
indeed
be
fatal
our
pleasant
free
relations
unruffled
by
storm
are
ideal
for
us
both
why
i
wonder
did
she
think
her
proposal
to
go
away
for
a
change
would
vex
me
the
idea
implies
a
right
of
veto
which
is
repugnant
to
me
of
all
the
hateful
attitudes
towards
a
woman
in
which
a
decent
man
can
view
himself
that
of
the
turkish
bashaw
is
the
most
detestable
women
seldom
give
men
credit
for
this
distaste
i
kissed
the
white
hand
of
judith
that
touched
my
wrist
and
told
her
not
to
doubt
my
understanding
she
cried
a
little
i
don
t
make
your
path
rougher
judith
i
whispered
she
checked
her
tears
and
her
eyes
brightened
wonderfully
you
you
do
nothing
but
smooth
it
and
level
like
a
said
i
she
laughed
sprang
to
her
feet
and
carried
me
off
gaily
to
the
kitchen
to
help
her
get
the
tea
ready
my
assistance
consisted
in
lighting
the
beneath
a
waterless
kettle
after
that
i
sprawled
against
the
dresser
and
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
watched
her
cut
thin
in
a
woman
s
deliciously
clumsy
way
once
as
the
bright
blade
went
perilously
near
her
palm
i
drew
in
my
breath
a
man
would
never
dream
of
doing
it
like
that
i
cried
in
rebuke
she
calmly
dropped
the
wafer
on
to
the
plate
and
handed
me
the
knife
and
loaf
do
it
your
way
she
said
with
a
smile
of
mock
humility
i
did
it
my
way
and
cut
my
finger
the
devil
s
in
the
knife
i
cried
but
that
s
the
right
judith
said
nothing
but
bound
up
my
wound
and
like
the
person
of
the
ballad
went
on
cutting
her
smile
however
was
provoking
and
all
this
time
i
said
half
an
hour
later
you
haven
t
told
me
where
you
are
paris
to
stay
with
delphine
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
i
have
met
delphine
carrere
if
ever
there
was
one
and
the
loyalest
soul
in
the
world
the
only
one
of
judith
s
early
women
friends
who
has
totally
ignored
the
fact
of
the
sacred
cap
of
good
repute
having
been
thrown
over
the
windmills
indeed
who
knows
whether
dear
delphine
herself
could
conscientiously
write
the
magic
initials
after
her
name
but
delphine
has
never
struck
me
as
a
person
in
whose
dwelling
one
could
find
conventual
seclusion
judith
however
explained
delphine
will
be
painting
all
day
and
dissipating
all
night
i
can
t
possibly
disturb
her
in
her
studio
for
she
has
to
work
tremendously
hard
and
i
m
decidedly
not
going
to
dissipate
with
her
so
i
shall
have
my
days
and
nights
to
my
sequestered
and
meditative
i
said
nothing
but
all
the
same
i
am
tolerably
certain
that
judith
being
judith
will
enjoy
prodigious
merrymaking
in
paris
she
is
absolutely
sincere
in
her
intentions
the
earth
holds
no
sincerer
woman
but
she
is
a
her
and
meditative
self
was
at
that
moment
sitting
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
and
smoking
a
cigarette
with
undisguised
relish
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
the
blue
smoke
wreathing
itself
amid
her
fair
hair
resembled
so
i
told
her
in
the
relaxed
intellectual
frame
of
mind
of
the
contented
man
incense
mounting
through
the
nimbus
of
a
saint
she
affected
solicitude
lest
the
of
my
intelligence
should
be
pouring
out
through
my
cut
finger
no
i
am
convinced
that
the
that
beautiful
french
word
for
which
we
have
no
english
equivalent
meaning
the
gathering
of
the
soul
together
within
itself
of
the
rue
boissy
d
anglais
is
the
very
happiest
delusion
wherewith
judith
has
hitherto
deluded
herself
i
am
glad
exceedingly
glad
her
temperament
i
have
got
reconciled
to
her
affliction
craves
the
gaiety
which
london
denies
her
and
when
are
you
going
i
asked
why
not
i
wired
delphine
this
morning
i
had
to
go
out
to
get
something
for
lunch
my
conviction
it
appears
was
right
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
an
omnibus
to
charing
cross
and
send
a
but
when
are
you
going
to
pack
i
did
that
last
night
i
didn
t
get
to
bed
till
four
this
morning
i
only
made
up
my
mind
after
you
had
gone
she
added
in
anticipation
of
a
possible
question
it
is
better
that
we
are
not
married
these
sudden
resolutions
would
throw
my
existence
out
of
gear
my
moral
upheaval
would
be
that
of
a
hen
in
front
of
a
when
i
go
abroad
i
like
at
least
a
fortnight
to
think
of
it
one
has
to
attune
one
s
mind
to
new
conditions
to
map
out
the
pleasant
scheme
of
days
to
savour
in
anticipation
the
delights
that
stand
there
awaiting
one
s
tasting
either
in
the
mystery
of
the
unknown
or
in
the
welcoming
light
of
familiarity
i
love
the
transition
that
can
be
so
subtly
gradated
by
the
spirit
between
one
scene
and
another
the
man
who
awakens
one
fine
morning
in
his
london
residence
scratches
his
head
and
says
what
shall
i
do
by
jove
i
ll
start
for
timbuctoo
is
to
me
an
incomprehensible
incomplete
being
he
lacks
an
aesthetic
sense
i
did
not
dare
tell
judith
she
lacked
an
aesthetic
sense
i
might
just
as
well
have
accused
her
of
stealing
silver
spoons
i
said
i
should
miss
her
which
i
certainly
shall
and
promised
to
write
to
her
once
a
week
and
you
said
i
will
have
heaps
of
time
to
write
me
the
history
of
a
sequestered
and
meditative
self
meanwhile
let
us
go
out
somewhere
and
when
i
got
home
i
found
a
card
on
my
mr
sebastian
i
am
sorry
i
missed
pasquale
i
haven
t
seen
him
for
two
or
three
years
he
is
a
fascinating
youth
a
study
in
reversion
i
will
ask
him
to
dinner
here
some
day
soon
it
will
be
quieter
than
at
the
club
chapter
iii
may
something
has
happened
something
fantastic
inconceivable
i
am
in
a
condition
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
if
a
witch
on
a
broomstick
rode
in
through
my
open
window
and
lectured
me
on
quaternions
i
should
accept
her
visit
as
a
normal
occurrence
i
have
spent
hours
walking
up
and
down
this
room
wondering
whether
the
universe
or
i
were
mad
sometimes
i
laughed
for
the
thing
is
sheerly
ridiculous
sometimes
i
cursed
at
the
impertinence
of
the
thing
in
happening
at
all
once
i
stumbled
over
a
volume
of
muratori
lying
on
the
floor
and
i
kicked
it
across
the
room
then
i
took
it
up
and
wept
over
the
loosened
binding
the
question
is
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
why
has
judith
chosen
this
particular
time
to
shut
up
her
flat
and
sequester
herself
in
paris
why
did
my
lawyers
appoint
this
particular
morning
for
me
to
sign
their
silly
documents
why
did
i
turn
up
three
hours
late
why
did
i
walk
down
the
thames
embankment
and
why
oh
why
did
i
seat
myself
on
a
bench
in
the
gardens
below
the
terrace
of
the
national
liberal
club
yesterday
was
one
of
the
most
peaceful
and
happy
days
of
my
existence
i
worked
contentedly
at
my
history
i
gossiped
with
antoinette
who
came
to
demand
permission
to
keep
a
cat
what
kind
of
a
cat
i
asked
perhaps
monsieur
does
not
like
cats
she
inquired
anxiously
the
cat
was
worshipped
as
a
god
by
the
ancient
egyptians
i
remarked
but
this
one
monsieur
she
said
in
breathless
reassurance
has
only
one
i
would
sooner
talk
to
antoinette
than
the
tutorial
staff
of
girton
if
she
woke
up
one
morning
and
found
she
had
a
mind
she
would
think
it
a
disease
in
the
afternoon
i
strolled
into
regent
s
park
and
meeting
the
mcmurray
s
son
in
charge
of
the
housemaid
around
whom
seemed
to
be
hovering
a
sheepish
individual
in
a
bowler
hat
i
took
him
off
to
the
zoological
gardens
on
the
way
he
told
me
with
great
glee
that
his
german
governess
was
in
bed
with
an
awful
sore
throat
that
he
wasn
t
doing
any
lessons
that
the
sheepish
hoverer
was
milly
s
young
man
and
that
the
silly
way
they
went
on
was
enough
to
make
one
sick
when
he
had
fed
everything
feedable
and
ridden
everything
ridable
i
drove
him
to
the
wellington
road
and
deposited
him
with
his
parents
i
love
a
couple
of
hours
with
a
child
when
it
is
thoroughly
happy
and
on
its
best
behaviour
and
the
enjoyment
is
enhanced
by
the
feeling
of
utter
thankfulness
that
he
is
not
my
child
but
somebody
else
s
in
the
evening
i
read
and
meditated
on
the
happiness
of
my
lot
the
years
of
school
drudgery
have
already
lost
their
sharp
edge
of
remembered
definition
and
sometimes
i
wonder
whether
it
is
i
who
lived
through
them
i
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
not
a
want
that
i
could
not
gratify
i
thought
of
judith
i
thought
of
sebastian
pasquale
i
amused
myself
by
seeking
a
renaissance
type
of
which
he
must
be
the
reincarnation
i
fixed
upon
young
olgiati
one
of
the
assassins
of
gian
galeazzo
sforza
of
the
many
hundreds
of
british
youths
who
passed
before
my
eyes
during
my
slavery
he
is
the
only
one
who
has
sought
me
out
in
his
manhood
and
strange
to
say
we
had
only
a
few
months
together
during
my
first
year
s
apprenticeship
to
the
dismal
craft
he
being
in
the
sixth
form
and
but
three
or
four
years
younger
than
i
he
was
the
maddest
oddest
most
diabolical
and
most
unpopular
boy
in
the
school
the
staff
to
whom
the
conventional
must
of
necessity
be
always
the
divine
loathed
him
i
alone
took
to
the
creature
i
think
now
that
my
quaint
passion
for
the
cinquecento
italian
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
my
attraction
in
externals
he
is
as
english
as
i
am
having
been
brought
up
in
england
by
an
english
mother
but
there
are
thousands
of
hindoos
who
are
more
british
than
he
the
mcmurrays
were
telling
me
dreadful
stories
about
him
this
afternoon
sighing
after
an
obdurate
viennese
dancer
he
had
lured
her
coachman
into
helpless
intoxication
had
invested
himself
in
the
domestic
s
livery
and
had
driven
off
with
the
lady
in
the
darkness
after
the
performance
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
what
happened
exactly
the
mcmurrays
did
not
know
but
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
in
vienna
and
yet
this
inconsequent
libertine
did
the
following
before
my
own
eyes
we
were
walking
down
piccadilly
together
one
afternoon
in
the
hard
winter
of
it
was
a
black
frost
agonizingly
cold
a
shivering
wretch
held
out
matches
for
sale
his
hideous
red
toes
protruded
through
his
boots
my
god
my
god
cried
pasquale
i
can
t
stand
this
he
jumped
into
a
crawling
hansom
tore
off
his
own
boots
flung
them
to
the
petrified
beggar
and
drove
home
in
his
i
stood
on
the
curb
and
with
mingled
feelings
watched
the
recipient
amid
an
interested
group
of
bystanders
match
the
small
shapely
sole
against
his
huge
foot
and
with
a
grin
tuck
the
boots
under
his
arm
and
march
away
with
them
to
the
nearest
pawnbroker
if
pasquale
had
been
an
equally
compassionate
briton
he
would
have
stopped
to
think
and
have
tossed
the
man
a
sovereign
he
didn
t
stop
to
that
was
my
cinquecento
pasquale
and
i
loved
him
for
it
i
went
to
bed
last
night
as
i
have
indicated
the
most
contented
of
created
beings
i
awoke
this
morning
with
no
greater
ruffle
on
my
consciousness
than
the
appointment
with
my
lawyers
the
sun
shone
a
thrush
sang
lustily
in
the
big
elm
opposite
my
bedroom
windows
the
tree
laughed
and
shook
out
its
finery
at
me
like
a
woman
saying
see
how
green
i
am
after
sunday
s
antoinette
s
one
eyed
black
cat
a
hideous
beast
met
me
in
the
hall
and
arching
its
back
welcomed
me
affably
to
its
new
residence
and
on
my
i
found
a
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
cristoforo
da
costa
s
delle
donne
a
book
which
in
great
diffidence
i
had
asked
lord
carnforth
a
perfect
stranger
to
allow
me
the
privilege
of
consulting
in
his
library
and
which
lord
carnforth
with
a
scholar
s
splendid
courtesy
had
sent
me
to
use
at
my
convenience
filled
with
peace
and
to
all
men
like
a
personification
of
christmas
in
may
i
started
out
this
morning
to
see
my
lawyers
i
reached
them
at
three
o
clock
having
idled
at
bookstalls
and
lunched
on
the
road
i
signed
their
unintelligible
document
and
wandered
through
the
temple
gardens
and
along
the
embankment
when
i
had
passed
under
hungerford
bridge
it
struck
me
that
i
was
warm
a
little
and
the
victoria
embankment
gardens
smiled
an
invitation
to
repose
i
struck
the
shady
path
beneath
the
terrace
of
the
national
liberal
club
and
sat
myself
down
on
a
comfortable
bench
the
only
other
occupant
was
a
female
in
black
as
i
take
no
interest
in
females
in
black
i
disregarded
her
presence
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
contemplation
of
the
trim
lawns
and
the
green
trees
masking
the
unsightly
surrey
side
of
the
river
and
the
back
of
the
statue
of
sir
bartle
frere
a
continued
survey
of
the
last
not
making
for
edification
a
statue
that
turns
its
back
on
you
being
one
of
the
dullest
objects
made
by
man
i
took
from
my
pocket
a
brown
volume
which
i
had
fished
out
of
a
penny
box
de
l
histoire
du
gouvernement
de
venise
ou
l
histoire
des
uscoques
par
le
sieur
houssaie
amsterdam
a
whole
complete
scholarly
history
of
a
forgotten
people
for
a
penny
the
uscoques
were
originally
dalmatians
who
settled
at
segna
on
the
adriatic
and
became
the
most
pestiferous
colony
of
pirates
and
desperadoes
of
sixteenth
century
europe
i
opened
the
pages
and
savoured
their
acrid
musty
smell
how
much
learning
thought
i
bought
with
the
heart
how
many
million
hours
of
fierce
intellectual
struggle
appeal
to
mankind
nowadays
but
as
an
odour
an
odour
of
decay
in
the
nostrils
of
here
and
there
a
casual
student
i
thought
this
and
my
eye
caught
repeated
many
times
the
name
of
the
frangipani
once
lords
of
segna
as
men
their
achievements
are
wiped
out
of
commonly
remembered
history
but
their
name
is
distilled
into
a
sensuous
perfume
which
perchance
may
be
found
in
the
penny
scent
fountains
of
i
was
smiling
over
this
quaint
olfactory
coincidence
and
wondering
whether
any
human
being
alive
at
that
moment
had
ever
read
the
sieur
houssaie
s
book
when
a
tug
at
my
arm
such
as
a
neglected
terrier
gives
with
his
paw
brought
me
back
to
the
workaday
world
i
turned
sharply
and
met
a
pair
of
melting
brown
piteous
imploring
dog
s
eyes
belonging
not
to
a
terrier
but
to
the
disregarded
female
in
black
will
you
please
sir
to
tell
me
what
i
must
i
stared
she
was
not
in
the
least
like
what
my
glance
at
the
female
in
black
had
taken
her
to
be
she
was
quite
young
remarkably
good
looking
even
at
the
first
instant
i
was
struck
by
her
eyes
and
the
mass
of
bronze
hair
and
the
twitching
of
a
childish
mouth
but
she
had
an
untidy
touzled
raffish
appearance
due
to
i
knew
not
what
investiture
of
disrepute
her
hands
for
she
wore
no
gloves
wanted
washing
what
a
young
girl
like
yourself
must
not
do
said
i
is
to
enter
into
conversation
with
men
in
public
then
i
shall
have
to
die
she
said
forlornly
edging
away
from
my
side
she
had
the
oddest
little
foreign
accent
i
looked
at
her
again
more
critically
and
discovered
what
it
was
that
made
her
look
so
disreputable
she
was
wearing
an
old
black
dress
many
sizes
too
big
for
her
great
pleats
of
it
were
secured
by
pins
in
unexpected
places
so
that
quaint
chaos
was
made
of
the
scheme
of
decoration
black
velvet
and
bugles
on
the
bodice
instinctively
i
felt
that
a
fat
jewess
had
built
it
many
years
ago
for
synagogue
wear
on
the
girlish
figure
it
looked
preposterous
preposterous
too
was
her
an
amorphous
bonnet
trimmed
in
black
with
a
cheap
black
feather
drooping
brokenly
her
eyes
gave
me
a
reproachful
glance
and
turned
away
again
then
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
sniffed
my
mother
had
a
housemaid
once
who
always
sniffed
like
that
before
beginning
to
cry
my
position
was
untenable
i
could
not
remain
stonily
on
the
seat
while
this
grotesquely
attired
damsel
wept
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
get
up
and
leave
her
she
looked
at
me
again
those
swimming
pleading
eyes
were
scarcely
human
i
capitulated
don
t
cry
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
said
she
moved
a
few
inches
nearer
i
want
to
find
harry
she
said
i
have
lost
who
s
harry
i
naturally
inquired
he
is
to
be
my
what
s
his
other
name
i
have
forgotten
she
said
spreading
out
her
hands
don
t
you
know
any
one
else
in
london
i
asked
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
and
i
am
getting
so
i
suggested
that
there
were
restaurants
in
london
but
i
have
no
money
she
objected
no
money
and
nothing
at
all
but
she
designated
her
dress
isn
t
it
ugly
it
is
decidedly
not
becoming
i
admitted
well
what
must
i
do
you
tell
me
and
i
do
it
if
you
don
t
tell
me
i
must
she
leaned
back
placidly
having
thus
put
upon
my
shoulders
the
responsibility
of
her
existence
i
did
not
know
which
to
admire
more
her
cool
assurance
or
the
stoic
fortitude
with
which
she
faced
dissolution
i
can
give
you
some
money
to
keep
you
going
for
a
day
or
two
said
i
but
as
for
finding
harry
without
knowing
his
name
after
all
i
don
t
want
so
very
much
to
find
him
said
this
amazing
young
person
he
made
me
stay
in
my
cabin
all
the
time
i
was
in
the
steamer
at
first
i
was
glad
for
it
went
up
and
down
side
to
side
and
i
thought
i
would
die
for
i
was
so
sick
but
afterwards
i
got
better
but
where
did
you
come
from
i
asked
from
what
were
you
doing
there
i
used
to
sit
in
a
tree
and
look
over
the
wall
what
wall
the
wall
of
my
father
s
house
he
was
not
my
father
but
he
married
my
mother
i
am
she
announced
the
fact
with
a
little
air
of
finality
indeed
said
i
yes
father
mother
both
english
he
was
he
died
before
i
was
born
then
his
friend
hamdi
effendi
took
my
mother
and
married
her
you
see
i
confessed
i
did
not
where
does
harry
come
in
i
inquired
she
looked
puzzled
come
in
she
echoed
i
perceived
her
knowledge
of
the
english
vernacular
was
limited
i
turned
my
question
differently
oh
she
said
with
more
animation
he
used
to
pass
by
the
wall
and
i
talked
to
him
when
there
was
no
one
looking
he
was
so
pretty
prettier
than
you
she
paused
is
it
possible
i
said
ironically
oh
yes
she
replied
with
profound
gravity
he
had
a
moustache
but
he
was
not
so
well
you
talked
to
harry
what
then
in
her
artless
way
she
told
me
a
refreshing
story
as
old
as
the
crusades
with
the
accessories
of
orthodox
tradition
a
european
disguise
purchased
at
a
slop
dealer
s
by
the
precious
harry
a
rope
a
midnight
flitting
a
passage
taken
on
board
an
english
ship
the
anchor
weighed
and
the
lovers
were
free
on
the
bounding
main
a
most
refreshing
story
i
put
on
a
sudden
air
of
sternness
and
shot
a
question
at
her
like
a
bullet
are
you
making
all
this
up
young
woman
she
quite
scared
you
mean
i
tell
lies
but
no
it
is
all
true
why
shouldn
t
it
be
true
how
else
could
i
have
come
here
the
question
was
unanswerable
her
story
was
as
preposterous
as
her
garments
but
her
garments
were
real
enough
i
looked
long
into
her
great
innocent
eyes
yes
she
was
telling
me
the
truth
she
babbled
on
for
a
little
i
gathered
that
her
hamdi
effendi
was
a
turkish
official
she
had
spent
all
her
life
in
the
harem
from
which
she
had
eloped
with
this
pretty
young
englishman
and
what
must
i
do
she
reiterated
i
told
her
to
give
me
time
one
is
not
in
the
habit
of
meeting
abducted
lights
of
the
harem
in
the
embankment
gardens
beneath
the
national
liberal
club
it
was
in
fact
a
bewildering
occurrence
i
looked
around
me
nothing
seemed
to
have
happened
during
the
last
ten
minutes
a
pale
young
man
on
the
next
bench
whom
i
had
noticed
when
i
entered
was
reading
a
dirty
pink
newspaper
pigeons
and
sparrows
hopped
about
unconcernedly
on
the
file
of
cabs
just
perceptible
through
the
foliage
the
cabmen
lolled
in
listless
attitudes
sir
bartle
frere
stolidly
kept
his
back
to
me
not
the
least
interested
in
this
gilbert
a
becket
story
i
always
thought
something
was
wrong
with
that
man
s
character
what
on
earth
could
i
tell
her
to
do
the
best
course
was
to
find
the
infernal
harry
i
asked
her
how
she
came
to
lose
him
it
appears
he
escorted
her
ashore
at
southampton
after
having
scarcely
set
eyes
on
her
during
the
voyage
put
her
into
a
railway
carriage
with
strict
injunctions
not
to
stir
until
he
claimed
her
and
then
disappeared
into
space
did
he
give
you
your
ticket
what
a
young
blackguard
i
exclaimed
i
don
t
like
him
at
all
she
said
how
she
managed
to
elude
the
ticket
collector
at
vauxhall
i
could
not
exactly
discover
apparently
she
told
him
in
her
confiding
manner
that
harry
had
it
and
when
he
found
no
harry
in
the
train
and
came
back
to
say
so
she
turned
her
dewy
imploring
eyes
on
him
and
the
sentimental
varlet
melted
at
waterloo
a
man
had
told
her
she
must
get
out
of
the
carriage
she
had
travelled
alone
in
it
and
she
had
meekly
obeyed
she
had
wandered
out
of
the
station
and
across
a
bridge
and
had
eventually
found
herself
in
the
embankment
gardens
then
she
had
asked
me
how
to
find
harry
really
she
was
ridiculously
like
thomas
a
becket
s
saracen
mother
crying
in
london
for
gilbert
and
the
most
ludicrous
part
of
the
resemblance
was
that
she
did
not
know
the
creature
s
surname
by
the
way
said
i
what
is
your
name
carlotta
what
i
asked
i
have
no
other
your
father
the
had
she
wrinkled
her
young
forehead
in
profound
mental
effort
ramsbotham
she
said
at
last
triumphantly
now
look
here
miss
ramsbotham
no
i
broke
off
such
an
appellation
is
anachronistic
incongruous
and
infinitely
absurd
i
can
t
use
it
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
as
but
i
ve
told
you
that
carlotta
is
my
name
she
said
in
uncomprehending
innocence
and
mine
is
sir
marcus
ordeyne
people
call
me
sir
seer
marcous
said
carlotta
she
did
not
seem
at
all
impressed
with
the
fact
that
she
was
talking
to
a
member
of
the
baronetage
quite
so
said
i
now
carlotta
i
resumed
our
first
plan
is
to
set
out
in
search
of
harry
he
may
have
missed
his
train
and
have
followed
by
a
later
one
and
be
even
now
rampaging
about
waterloo
station
if
we
hear
nothing
of
him
i
will
drive
you
to
the
turkish
consulate
give
you
in
charge
there
and
they
will
see
you
safely
home
to
alexandretta
the
good
hamdi
effendi
is
doubtless
distracted
and
will
welcome
you
back
with
open
i
meant
to
be
urbane
and
friendly
she
rose
to
her
feet
grew
as
white
as
paper
opened
her
great
eyes
opened
her
baby
mouth
and
in
the
middle
of
the
embankment
gardens
plumped
on
her
knees
before
me
and
clasped
her
hands
above
her
head
for
god
s
sake
get
up
i
shrieked
wrenching
her
back
acrobatically
to
the
bench
beside
me
you
mustn
t
do
things
like
that
you
ll
have
the
whole
of
london
running
to
look
at
indeed
the
sight
had
so
far
roused
the
pale
young
man
from
his
lethargy
that
he
laid
his
dirty
pink
paper
on
his
knees
i
kept
hold
of
carlotta
s
wrists
she
began
to
moan
incoherently
you
mustn
t
send
me
back
hamdi
will
kill
me
oh
please
don
t
send
me
back
he
will
make
me
marry
his
friend
mustapha
mustapha
has
only
two
teeth
and
he
is
seventy
years
old
and
he
has
a
wife
already
i
only
went
with
harry
to
avoid
mustapha
hamdi
would
kill
me
he
would
beat
me
he
would
make
me
marry
that
is
what
i
gathered
from
her
utterances
she
was
frightened
out
of
her
wits
even
into
anticlimax
but
the
turkish
consul
is
your
natural
protector
said
i
you
wouldn
t
be
so
cruel
she
sobbed
the
guttural
sonority
with
which
she
rolled
the
r
in
cruel
made
the
epithet
appear
one
of
revolting
barbarity
she
fixed
those
confounded
eyes
upon
me
i
wonder
whether
such
a
fool
as
i
has
ever
lived
i
promised
on
my
honour
not
to
hand
her
over
to
the
turkish
consulate
i
took
a
cab
from
the
rank
on
the
embankment
and
drove
her
to
waterloo
on
the
way
she
reminded
me
that
she
was
hungry
i
gave
her
food
at
the
buffet
it
appears
she
has
a
passion
for
eggs
and
lemonade
she
did
not
seem
very
much
concerned
about
finding
harry
but
chattered
to
me
about
the
appointments
of
the
bar
the
amused
her
particularly
she
made
me
order
a
glass
of
bitter
a
beverage
which
i
loathe
in
order
to
see
again
how
it
was
done
and
broke
into
gleeful
laughter
the
smart
but
unimaginative
barmaid
stared
at
her
in
bewilderment
the
two
or
three
also
stared
i
was
glad
to
escape
to
the
platform
there
however
a
group
of
idlers
followed
us
about
and
stood
in
a
ring
round
us
when
we
stopped
to
interview
a
railway
official
the
beautiful
young
woman
in
her
disreputable
attire
i
have
never
seen
a
broken
black
feather
waggle
more
shamelessly
was
a
sight
indeed
to
strike
wonderment
into
the
cockney
mind
and
perhaps
her
association
with
myself
added
to
the
incongruity
i
am
long
and
lean
and
unlovely
i
know
but
it
is
my
consolation
that
i
look
irreproachably
respectable
of
the
two
i
was
infinitely
the
more
disturbed
by
the
public
attention
calm
and
unembarrassed
as
a
fate
she
returned
the
popular
gaze
and
appeared
somewhat
bored
by
my
efforts
to
find
harry
in
the
midst
of
an
earnest
discussion
with
the
she
begged
me
for
a
penny
to
put
into
an
automatic
sweetmeat
machine
which
she
had
seen
a
small
boy
work
successfully
i
refused
curtly
and
turned
to
the
a
roar
of
laughter
interrupted
me
again
carlotta
with
outstretched
hand
and
pleading
eyes
like
an
s
monkey
had
induced
the
boy
to
part
with
the
sticky
bit
of
toffee
and
was
in
the
act
of
conveying
it
to
her
mouth
i
ll
call
morning
said
i
hurriedly
to
the
if
the
gentleman
should
come
meanwhile
tell
him
to
leave
his
name
and
then
i
took
carlotta
by
the
arm
and
accompanied
by
my
train
of
satellites
i
thrust
her
into
the
first
i
could
see
there
was
no
sign
or
token
of
harry
no
pretty
young
man
was
hanging
dejectedly
about
the
station
none
had
torn
his
hair
before
the
officials
asking
for
news
of
a
lost
female
in
frowsy
black
there
was
no
harry
there
was
no
further
need
therefore
to
afford
the
british
public
a
gratuitous
entertainment
drive
said
i
to
the
cabman
drive
like
the
where
to
sir
i
gasped
where
should
i
drive
i
lost
my
head
go
on
driving
round
and
round
till
i
tell
you
to
the
philosophic
cabman
did
not
regard
me
as
eccentric
for
he
whipped
up
his
horse
cheerfully
when
we
had
slid
down
the
steep
incline
and
got
free
of
the
precincts
of
that
hateful
station
i
breathed
more
freely
and
collected
my
wits
carlotta
sucked
her
sticky
thumbs
and
wiped
them
on
her
dress
where
are
we
going
she
asked
across
waterloo
bridge
said
i
what
to
do
to
dispose
of
you
somehow
i
replied
grimly
but
how
i
haven
t
a
notion
there
s
a
home
for
lost
dogs
and
a
home
for
stray
cats
and
a
lost
property
office
at
scotland
yard
but
as
you
are
neither
a
dog
nor
a
cat
nor
an
umbrella
these
refuges
are
the
cab
reached
the
strand
east
or
west
sir
inquired
the
driver
west
said
i
at
random
we
drove
down
the
strand
at
a
leisurely
pace
i
passed
through
a
phase
of
agonised
thought
by
my
side
was
a
helpless
homeless
friendless
penniless
young
woman
as
beautiful
as
a
goddess
and
as
as
a
baby
what
in
the
world
could
i
do
with
her
i
looked
at
her
in
despair
she
met
my
glance
with
a
contented
smile
just
as
if
we
were
old
acquaintances
and
i
were
taking
her
out
to
dinner
the
unfamiliar
roar
and
bustle
of
london
impressed
her
no
more
than
it
would
have
impressed
a
little
dog
who
had
found
a
kind
master
suppose
i
gave
you
some
money
and
put
you
down
here
and
left
you
i
inquired
i
should
die
she
answered
fatalistically
or
perhaps
i
should
find
another
kind
i
wonder
if
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
soul
said
i
she
plucked
at
her
gown
i
have
only
this
and
it
is
very
ugly
she
remarked
again
i
should
like
a
pink
we
crossed
trafalgar
square
and
i
saw
by
big
ben
that
it
was
a
quarter
to
six
i
could
not
drive
through
london
with
her
for
an
indefinite
period
besides
my
half
past
seven
dinner
awaited
me
why
oh
why
has
judith
gone
to
paris
had
she
been
in
town
i
could
have
shot
carlotta
into
tottenham
mansions
and
gone
home
to
my
dinner
and
cristoforo
da
costa
with
a
light
heart
judith
would
have
found
carlotta
vastly
entertaining
she
would
have
washed
her
body
and
analysed
her
temperament
but
judith
was
in
retreat
with
delphine
carrere
and
has
left
me
alone
to
bear
the
responsibilities
of
life
and
carlotta
the
cab
slowly
mounted
waterloo
place
i
had
thought
of
my
aunts
as
possible
helpers
and
rejected
the
idea
i
had
thought
of
a
police
station
a
hotel
my
lawyers
too
late
a
furnished
lodging
a
hospital
my
mind
was
an
aching
blank
where
do
you
live
asked
carlotta
i
looked
at
her
and
groaned
it
was
the
only
solution
up
regent
s
park
way
i
replied
aware
that
she
was
none
the
wiser
for
the
information
i
gave
the
address
to
the
cabman
through
the
in
the
roof
i
m
going
to
take
you
home
with
me
for
i
said
severely
i
have
an
excellent
french
housekeeper
who
will
look
after
your
comfort
and
if
that
infernal
young
scoundrel
of
a
lover
of
yours
is
not
found
it
will
not
be
the
fault
of
the
police
force
of
great
she
laid
her
grubby
little
hand
on
mine
it
was
very
soft
and
cool
you
are
cross
with
me
why
i
removed
her
hand
you
mustn
t
do
that
again
said
i
no
i
am
not
in
the
least
cross
with
you
but
i
hope
you
are
aware
that
this
event
is
of
an
unprecedented
what
is
an
unprecedented
character
she
asked
stumbling
over
the
long
words
a
thing
that
has
never
happened
before
and
i
devoutly
hope
will
not
happen
her
face
was
turned
to
me
the
lower
lip
trembled
a
little
the
came
into
those
wonderful
eyes
you
will
be
kind
to
me
she
said
in
her
childish
monosyllables
each
word
carefully
articulated
with
a
long
pause
between
i
felt
i
had
behaved
like
a
heartless
brute
ever
since
i
thrust
her
into
the
cab
at
waterloo
i
relented
and
laughed
if
you
are
a
good
girl
and
do
as
i
tell
you
said
i
seer
marcous
is
my
lord
and
i
am
his
slave
was
her
astounding
reply
then
i
realised
that
she
had
been
brought
up
by
hamdi
effendi
there
is
something
salutary
after
all
in
the
training
of
the
harem
i
m
very
glad
to
hear
it
i
said
she
closed
her
eyes
i
saw
now
she
was
very
tired
i
thought
she
had
gone
to
sleep
and
i
looked
in
front
of
me
puzzling
out
the
problem
presently
the
were
thrust
violently
open
and
if
i
had
net
held
her
back
she
would
have
jumped
out
of
the
vehicle
look
she
cried
in
great
excitement
there
there
s
harry
s
name
she
pointed
to
a
butcher
s
cart
immediately
in
front
of
us
bearing
in
large
letters
the
name
of
e
we
must
stop
she
went
on
he
will
tell
us
about
it
took
me
from
oxford
circus
to
portman
square
to
convince
her
that
there
were
many
thousands
of
robinsons
in
london
and
that
the
probability
of
the
butcher
s
cart
being
a
clue
to
harry
s
whereabouts
was
exceedingly
remote
at
baker
street
station
she
asked
wearily
is
it
still
far
to
your
house
no
said
i
encouragingly
not
very
but
one
can
drive
for
many
days
through
streets
in
london
and
there
will
be
still
streets
still
houses
so
they
tell
me
in
alexandretta
london
is
as
big
as
the
moon
not
so
i
felt
absurdly
pleased
she
was
capable
of
an
idea
i
had
begun
to
wonder
whether
she
were
not
merely
the
fact
of
her
being
able
to
read
had
already
cheered
me
many
hours
yes
i
corrected
not
many
days
london
seems
big
to
you
oh
yes
she
said
passing
her
hand
over
her
eyes
it
makes
all
go
round
in
my
head
one
day
you
will
take
me
for
a
drive
through
these
wonderful
streets
now
i
am
too
tired
they
make
my
head
then
she
shut
her
eyes
again
and
did
not
open
them
until
we
stopped
at
lingfield
terrace
i
modified
my
first
impression
of
her
animal
unimpressionability
she
is
quite
sane
if
boadicea
were
to
be
brought
back
to
life
and
be
set
down
suddenly
at
charing
cross
her
psychological
condition
would
not
be
far
removed
from
that
of
an
idiot
yet
in
her
own
environment
boadicea
was
quite
a
sane
and
capable
lady
my
admirable
man
stenson
opened
the
door
and
admitted
us
without
moving
a
muscle
he
would
betray
no
incorrect
astonishment
if
i
brought
home
a
hippogriff
to
dinner
i
have
an
admiration
for
the
trained
s
imperturbability
it
is
the
guardian
angel
of
his
i
ordered
him
to
send
antoinette
to
me
in
the
antoinette
said
i
this
young
lady
has
travelled
all
the
way
from
asia
minor
where
the
good
paul
had
so
many
adventures
without
changing
her
est
y
dieu
said
antoinette
give
her
a
nice
hot
bath
and
perhaps
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
lend
her
the
underlinen
that
your
sex
is
in
the
habit
of
wearing
you
will
put
her
into
the
spare
bedroom
as
she
is
going
to
pass
the
night
here
and
you
will
look
generally
after
her
m
said
antoinette
regarding
carlotta
in
stupefaction
and
put
that
hat
and
dress
into
the
m
and
as
mademoiselle
is
broken
with
fatigue
having
come
without
stopping
from
asia
minor
she
will
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
poor
angel
said
antoinette
but
will
she
not
join
monsieur
at
dinner
i
think
not
said
i
dryly
but
the
young
ducklings
that
are
roasting
for
the
dinner
of
monsieur
if
they
were
not
roasting
they
might
be
growing
up
into
ducks
said
i
oh
la
la
murmured
antoinette
below
her
breath
carlotta
said
i
turning
to
the
girl
who
had
seated
herself
humbly
on
a
chair
you
will
go
with
antoinette
and
do
as
she
tells
you
she
doesn
t
talk
english
but
she
is
used
to
making
people
understand
moi
parley
francais
un
said
carlotta
then
you
will
win
antoinette
s
heart
and
she
will
lend
you
her
finest
said
i
abruptly
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
she
took
my
outstretched
hand
and
to
my
great
embarrassment
raised
it
to
her
lips
antoinette
looked
on
with
a
sentimental
moisture
in
her
eyes
the
poor
angel
she
repeated
later
i
gave
stenson
a
succinct
account
of
what
had
occurred
i
owed
it
to
my
reputation
then
i
went
upstairs
and
dressed
for
dinner
i
consider
i
owe
that
to
stenson
it
was
eight
o
clock
before
i
sat
down
but
antoinette
s
ducklings
were
delicious
and
brought
consolation
for
the
upheaval
of
the
day
i
was
unfolding
the
latest
edition
of
westminster
with
which
i
always
soothe
the
digestive
after
dinner
when
antoinette
entered
to
report
progress
she
was
sound
asleep
the
poor
little
one
oh
but
she
was
tired
she
had
eaten
some
a
bit
of
fish
and
an
omelette
but
she
was
beautiful
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
she
had
a
skin
dirait
du
had
not
monsieur
noticed
it
i
replied
with
some
that
i
had
not
monsieur
rather
regards
the
inside
of
his
books
said
antoinette
they
are
generally
more
worth
regarding
said
antoinette
said
nothing
but
there
was
a
feminine
quiver
at
the
corners
of
her
fat
lips
she
was
comfortably
disposed
of
for
the
night
i
drew
a
breath
of
relief
great
scotland
yard
should
set
out
on
the
track
of
the
absconding
harry
carlotta
s
happy
recollection
of
his
surname
facilitated
the
search
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
opened
westminster
a
few
moments
later
i
was
staring
at
the
paper
in
blank
horror
and
dismay
harry
was
found
there
was
no
mistake
harry
robinson
junior
partner
of
the
firm
of
robinson
of
mincing
lane
vain
indeed
would
it
be
to
seek
the
help
of
great
scotland
yard
harry
had
blown
out
his
brains
in
the
south
western
hotel
at
southampton
i
have
read
the
newspaper
paragraph
over
and
over
again
there
is
no
possible
room
for
doubt
that
it
is
the
same
harry
the
ways
of
man
are
past
interpretation
here
is
an
individual
who
lures
a
girl
from
an
oriental
harem
attires
her
in
disgusting
garments
smuggles
her
on
board
a
steamer
where
he
claps
her
so
to
speak
under
hatches
and
has
little
if
anything
to
do
with
her
sets
her
penniless
and
ticketless
in
a
london
train
and
then
goes
off
and
blows
his
brains
out
where
is
the
sense
of
it
i
have
not
a
spark
of
sympathy
for
harry
a
callow
egotistical
dealer
in
currants
he
ought
to
have
blown
out
his
brains
a
year
ago
he
has
behaved
in
a
most
unconscionable
manner
how
does
he
expect
me
to
break
the
news
to
carlotta
his
selfishness
is
appalling
there
he
lies
comfortably
dead
in
the
south
western
hotel
while
carlotta
has
literally
not
a
rag
to
her
back
her
horrific
belongings
having
been
dropped
into
the
who
does
he
think
is
going
to
provide
carlotta
with
food
and
shelter
and
a
pink
dress
what
does
he
imagine
is
to
become
of
the
poor
waif
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
heard
of
a
more
cynical
suicide
i
have
walked
about
for
hours
laughing
and
cursing
and
kicking
the
binding
loose
of
my
precious
muratori
i
have
wondered
whether
the
universe
or
i
were
mad
for
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
to
me
carlotta
is
here
and
here
carlotta
must
remain
devastating
though
it
be
to
the
quietude
of
my
life
i
must
adopt
carlotta
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
chapter
iv
may
shall
i
be
accused
of
harbouring
a
bevy
of
odalisques
at
no
lingfield
terrace
calumny
and
exaggeration
walk
abroad
arm
in
arm
even
on
the
north
side
of
regent
s
park
if
they
had
spied
carlotta
at
my
window
this
morning
they
would
have
looked
in
for
afternoon
tea
at
my
aunt
jessica
s
and
have
waylaid
ralph
ordeyne
outside
the
oratory
the
question
is
shall
truth
anticipate
them
i
think
not
every
family
has
its
irrepressible
impossible
unpractical
member
its
who
is
forever
doing
the
wrong
thing
with
the
best
intentions
truth
is
the
of
the
virtues
some
times
it
puts
them
to
the
blush
and
throws
them
into
confusion
at
others
it
blusters
like
a
blatant
liar
at
others
again
it
stutters
and
stammers
like
a
detected
thief
there
is
no
knowing
how
truth
may
behave
so
i
shall
not
let
it
visit
my
relations
i
must
confess
however
that
i
feared
the
possible
passing
by
of
the
two
decrepit
cronies
when
carlotta
stood
at
my
open
french
window
this
morning
she
is
really
indecently
beautiful
she
was
wearing
a
deep
red
silk
peignoir
open
at
the
throat
unashamedly
parisian
which
clung
to
every
salient
curve
of
her
figure
i
wondered
where
in
the
name
of
morality
she
had
procured
the
garment
i
learned
later
that
it
was
the
joy
and
pride
of
antoinette
s
existence
for
once
in
the
days
long
ago
when
she
was
de
to
a
luminary
of
the
cafes
concerts
it
had
met
around
her
waist
she
had
treasured
the
finery
of
this
star
she
beamed
in
the
seventies
for
all
these
years
and
now
its
immortal
devilry
transfigured
carlotta
she
was
also
washed
specklessly
clean
an
aroma
that
no
soap
or
artificial
perfume
could
give
disengaged
itself
from
her
as
she
moved
her
hair
was
superbly
ordered
i
noticed
her
arms
which
the
sleeves
of
the
gay
garment
left
bare
to
the
elbows
the
skin
was
like
satin
sa
peau
on
dirait
du
confound
antoinette
she
had
the
audacity
too
to
come
down
with
bare
feet
it
was
a
revelation
of
pink
loveliness
in
tus
i
repeat
she
is
indecently
beautiful
a
chit
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
for
that
i
learn
is
her
age
has
no
right
to
flaunt
the
beauty
that
should
be
the
appanage
of
the
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
she
should
be
modestly
as
becomes
her
childish
stage
of
development
she
looked
incongruous
among
my
sober
books
and
i
regarded
her
with
some
resentment
i
dislike
the
exotic
i
prefer
geraniums
to
orchids
i
have
a
row
of
pots
of
the
former
on
my
balcony
and
the
united
efforts
of
stenson
antoinette
and
myself
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
making
them
bloom
but
i
love
the
unassuming
velvety
leaves
carlotta
is
a
flaring
orchid
and
produces
on
my
retina
a
sensation
of
disquiet
i
broke
the
tidings
of
the
tragedy
as
gently
as
i
could
i
had
news
of
harry
i
said
gravely
she
merely
looked
interested
and
asked
me
when
he
was
coming
i
m
afraid
he
will
never
come
said
i
if
he
does
not
come
then
i
can
stay
here
with
you
her
eyes
betrayed
a
quiver
of
anxiety
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
avoid
the
ironical
if
you
will
condescend
to
dwell
as
a
member
of
my
family
beneath
my
humble
the
irony
was
lost
on
her
she
uttered
a
joyous
little
cry
and
held
out
both
her
hands
to
me
her
eyes
danced
oh
i
am
glad
he
is
not
coming
i
don
t
like
him
any
more
i
love
to
stay
here
with
i
took
both
the
hands
in
mine
mortal
man
could
not
have
done
otherwise
have
you
thought
why
it
is
that
you
will
never
see
harry
again
she
shook
her
beautiful
head
and
held
it
to
one
side
and
puckered
up
her
brows
like
a
wistful
terrier
is
he
dead
would
it
grieve
you
if
he
were
she
replied
thoughtfully
then
said
i
dropping
her
hands
and
turning
away
harry
is
she
stood
silent
for
a
couple
of
minutes
regarding
the
row
of
pink
toes
that
protruded
beneath
the
peignoir
at
last
her
bosom
shook
with
a
sigh
she
glanced
up
at
me
sweetly
i
am
so
glad
she
said
that
is
all
she
has
vouchsafed
to
say
with
regard
to
the
unhappy
young
man
she
was
so
glad
she
has
not
even
asked
how
he
met
his
death
she
has
simply
accepted
my
statement
harry
is
dead
he
has
gone
out
of
her
life
like
yesterday
s
sunshine
or
yesterday
s
frippery
if
i
had
told
her
that
yesterday
s
had
broken
his
neck
she
could
not
be
more
unconcerned
nay
she
is
glad
harry
had
not
treated
her
nicely
he
had
boxed
her
up
in
a
cabin
where
she
had
been
sick
and
had
subjected
her
to
various
other
discomforts
i
on
the
contrary
had
surrounded
her
with
luxuries
and
dressed
her
in
red
silk
she
rather
dreaded
harry
s
coming
when
she
learned
that
this
was
improbable
she
was
relieved
his
death
had
turned
the
improbable
into
the
impossible
it
was
the
end
of
the
matter
she
was
so
glad
yet
there
must
have
been
some
tender
passage
in
their
brief
intercourse
he
must
have
kissed
her
during
their
flight
from
home
to
steamer
her
young
pulses
must
have
throbbed
a
little
faster
at
the
sight
of
his
comely
face
what
kind
of
a
mythological
being
am
i
housing
did
she
come
at
all
out
of
hamdi
effendi
s
harem
is
she
not
rather
some
strange
that
clambered
on
board
the
vessel
and
bewitched
the
miserable
boy
sucked
the
soul
out
of
him
and
drove
him
to
destruction
or
is
she
a
vampire
or
a
succubus
or
a
hamadryad
or
a
salamander
one
thing
i
vow
she
is
not
human
if
only
judith
were
here
to
advise
me
and
yet
i
have
an
uneasy
feeling
that
judith
will
suggest
with
a
certain
violence
that
is
characteristic
of
her
the
one
course
which
i
can
not
follow
to
send
carlotta
back
to
hamdi
effendi
but
i
can
not
break
my
word
i
would
rather
far
rather
break
carlotta
s
beautiful
neck
i
have
not
written
to
judith
nor
by
the
way
have
i
received
a
letter
from
her
delphine
has
been
whirling
her
off
her
legs
and
she
is
ashamed
to
confess
the
delusion
of
the
sequestered
life
i
wish
i
were
enjoying
myself
half
as
much
as
judith
i
have
adopted
mademoiselle
said
i
to
antoinette
this
morning
if
she
returned
to
asia
minor
they
would
put
a
string
round
her
neck
tie
her
up
in
a
sack
and
throw
her
into
the
that
would
be
a
pity
said
antoinette
warmly
said
i
anyhow
she
is
here
and
here
she
in
that
case
said
antoinette
has
monsieur
considered
that
the
poor
angel
will
need
clothes
and
articles
of
toilette
and
this
and
that
and
the
other
and
shoes
to
hide
her
shameless
tus
i
said
they
are
the
most
beautiful
toes
i
have
ever
seen
cried
antoinette
in
imbecile
admiration
she
has
bewitched
that
old
woman
already
i
put
on
my
hat
and
went
to
wellington
road
to
consult
mcmurray
heaven
be
thanked
thought
i
for
letting
me
take
her
little
boy
the
day
before
yesterday
to
see
the
other
animals
and
thus
winning
a
mother
s
heart
she
will
help
me
out
of
my
dilemma
unfortunately
she
was
not
alone
her
husband
who
is
on
the
staff
of
a
morning
newspaper
was
breakfasting
when
i
arrived
he
is
a
great
ruddy
bearded
giant
with
a
rumbling
thunder
of
a
laugh
like
the
bass
notes
of
an
organ
his
assertion
of
the
masculine
principle
in
brawn
and
beard
and
bass
somewhat
overpowers
a
and
tenor
person
like
myself
mcmurray
on
the
contrary
is
a
small
bright
bird
of
a
woman
i
told
my
amazing
story
from
beginning
to
end
interrupted
by
many
s
from
mcmurray
you
may
laugh
said
i
but
to
have
a
mythical
being
out
of
olympiodorus
quartered
on
you
for
life
is
no
jesting
olymp
began
mcmurray
yes
i
snapped
bring
her
this
afternoon
sir
marcus
when
this
unsympathetic
wretch
has
gone
to
his
club
said
his
wife
and
i
ll
take
her
out
but
dear
lady
i
cried
in
despair
she
has
but
one
garment
and
that
a
silk
of
horrible
depravity
that
belonged
to
a
dancer
of
the
second
empire
she
is
also
then
i
ll
come
round
myself
and
see
what
can
be
and
by
jove
so
will
i
cried
mcmurray
you
ll
do
such
thing
said
his
wife
if
i
gave
you
a
cheque
for
said
i
do
you
think
you
could
get
her
what
she
wants
to
go
on
with
a
hundred
pounds
the
little
lady
uttered
a
delighted
gasp
and
i
thought
she
would
have
kissed
me
mcmurray
brought
his
sledgehammer
of
a
hand
down
on
my
shoulder
man
he
roared
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
casting
a
respectable
wife
and
mother
of
a
family
loose
among
london
drapery
shops
with
a
hundred
pounds
in
her
pocket
do
you
think
she
will
henceforward
give
a
thought
to
her
home
or
husband
do
you
want
to
ruin
my
domestic
peace
drive
me
to
drink
and
wreck
my
household
if
you
do
that
again
said
i
rubbing
my
shoulder
i
ll
give
her
two
when
i
returned
carlotta
was
sitting
turkish
fashion
on
a
sofa
smoking
a
cigarette
to
which
she
had
helped
herself
out
of
my
box
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
book
this
sign
of
literary
taste
surprised
me
but
i
soon
found
it
was
the
second
volume
of
my
de
of
louandre
s
arts
to
whose
place
on
the
shelves
sheer
feminine
instinct
must
have
guided
her
i
announced
mcmurray
s
proposed
visit
she
jumped
to
her
feet
ravished
at
the
prospect
and
sent
my
beautiful
book
it
is
bound
in
and
contains
a
couple
of
hundred
exquisitely
coloured
plates
flying
onto
the
floor
i
picked
it
up
tenderly
and
laid
it
on
my
carlotta
said
i
the
first
thing
you
have
to
learn
here
is
that
books
in
england
are
more
precious
than
babies
in
alexandretta
if
you
pitch
them
about
in
this
fashion
you
will
murder
them
and
i
shall
have
you
this
checked
her
sumptuary
excitement
it
gave
her
food
for
reflection
and
she
stood
humbly
penitent
while
i
went
further
into
the
subject
of
clothes
in
fact
i
concluded
you
will
be
dressed
like
a
she
opened
the
book
at
a
gaudy
picture
xvi
ieme
siecle
saltimbanque
et
and
pointed
to
the
female
mountebank
this
young
person
wore
a
bright
green
tunic
bordered
with
gold
and
finished
off
at
the
elbows
and
waist
with
red
over
an
undergown
of
flaring
pink
the
sleeves
of
which
reached
her
wrist
she
was
crowned
with
red
and
white
carnations
stuck
in
ivy
i
will
get
a
dress
like
that
said
carlotta
i
wondered
how
far
mcmurray
possessed
the
and
i
trembled
i
tried
to
explain
gently
to
carlotta
the
undesirability
of
such
a
costume
for
outdoor
wear
in
london
but
with
tastes
there
is
no
disputing
and
i
saw
that
she
was
but
she
will
require
training
in
aesthetics
she
is
very
submissive
i
said
run
away
now
to
antoinette
and
she
went
with
the
cheerfulness
of
a
child
i
must
rig
up
a
for
her
as
i
can
not
have
her
in
here
also
for
the
present
she
must
take
her
meals
in
her
own
apartments
i
can
not
shock
the
admirable
stenson
by
sitting
down
at
table
with
her
in
that
improper
peignoir
besides
as
antoinette
informs
me
the
poor
lamb
eats
meat
with
her
fingers
after
the
fashion
of
the
east
i
know
what
that
is
having
once
been
present
at
an
egyptian
in
cairo
and
pulled
reeking
lumps
of
flesh
out
of
the
leg
of
mutton
ugh
but
as
she
has
probably
not
sat
down
to
a
meal
with
a
man
in
her
life
her
banishment
from
my
table
will
not
hurt
her
feelings
she
must
however
be
trained
in
christian
as
well
as
in
aesthetics
also
in
a
great
many
other
things
mcmurray
arrived
with
a
a
pencil
and
a
notebook
first
she
announced
i
will
measure
her
all
over
then
i
will
go
out
and
procure
her
a
set
of
garments
and
tomorrow
we
will
spend
the
whole
livelong
day
in
the
shops
do
you
mind
if
i
use
part
of
the
for
the
hire
of
a
private
brougham
have
a
coach
and
six
my
dear
mcmurray
i
said
it
will
doubtless
please
carlotta
i
summoned
carlotta
and
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction
to
my
surprise
she
was
perfectly
at
her
ease
and
with
the
greatest
courtesy
of
manner
invited
the
visitor
to
accompany
her
to
her
own
apartments
when
mcmurray
returned
to
the
she
wore
an
expression
that
can
only
be
described
as
indescribable
what
my
dear
sir
marcus
do
you
think
is
to
be
the
ultimate
destiny
of
that
young
person
she
shall
learn
said
i
suddenly
inspired
and
make
a
fair
copy
of
my
renaissance
she
would
make
a
very
fair
copy
indeed
of
renaissance
morals
returned
the
lady
dryly
is
she
so
very
dreadful
i
asked
in
alarm
the
peignoir
i
know
perhaps
that
has
something
to
do
with
then
for
heaven
s
sake
said
i
dress
her
in
drabs
and
greys
and
subfusc
browns
cut
off
her
hair
and
give
her
a
row
of
buttons
down
the
my
friend
s
eyes
sparkled
i
am
going
said
she
to
have
the
day
of
my
life
carlotta
had
already
gone
to
sleep
so
antoinette
informed
me
when
the
results
of
mcmurray
s
shopping
came
home
i
am
glad
she
has
early
habits
it
appears
she
has
spent
a
happy
and
fully
occupied
afternoon
over
a
pile
of
french
illustrated
comic
papers
in
the
possession
of
my
excellent
housekeeper
i
wonder
whether
it
is
quite
judicious
to
make
french
comic
papers
her
initiation
into
the
ideas
of
western
civilisation
into
this
i
must
inquire
i
must
also
talk
seriously
to
her
with
a
view
to
her
ultimate
destiny
but
as
my
view
would
be
distorted
by
the
red
i
shall
wait
until
she
is
decently
clad
i
think
i
shall
have
to
set
apart
certain
hours
of
the
day
for
instructive
conversation
with
carlotta
i
shall
have
to
develop
her
mind
of
which
she
distinctly
has
the
rudiments
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
must
provide
entertainment
out
of
her
own
resources
this
her
oriental
habits
of
seclusion
will
render
an
easy
task
for
i
will
wager
that
hamdi
effendi
did
not
concern
himself
greatly
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
ladies
of
his
harem
filled
up
their
time
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
certainly
did
not
allow
carlotta
to
sprawl
about
his
own
private
and
particular
i
will
not
westernise
her
too
rapidly
the
turkish
educational
system
has
its
merits
this
in
its
way
is
comforting
if
only
i
could
accept
her
as
a
human
creature
but
when
i
think
of
her
callous
reception
of
the
tidings
of
the
unhappy
boy
s
death
my
spirit
fails
me
such
a
being
would
run
a
into
you
as
you
slept
without
any
compunction
and
when
you
squeaked
she
would
laugh
look
at
her
base
ingratitude
to
the
good
hamdi
effendi
who
took
her
in
before
she
was
born
and
has
treated
her
as
a
daughter
all
her
life
no
her
spiritual
attitude
all
through
has
been
that
of
the
ladies
who
used
to
visit
anthony
in
the
leisure
moments
when
they
were
not
actively
engaged
in
temptation
i
don
t
believe
her
father
was
an
english
he
was
satan
i
wonder
what
she
told
mcmurray
i
have
been
thinking
over
the
matter
the
good
lady
was
wrong
whatever
were
the
morals
of
the
renaissance
personalities
were
essentially
positive
they
were
devilishly
wicked
or
angelically
good
there
was
nothing
about
the
renaissance
italian
the
women
were
strongly
tempered
i
love
to
believe
the
story
told
by
machiavelli
and
muratori
of
catherine
sforza
in
the
citadel
of
forli
surrender
or
we
slay
your
children
which
we
hold
as
hostages
cried
the
besiegers
kill
them
if
you
like
i
can
breed
more
to
avenge
it
is
the
speech
of
a
giant
nature
it
awakens
something
enthusiastic
within
me
although
such
a
lady
would
be
an
undesirable
helpmeet
for
a
mild
mannered
man
like
myself
and
then
again
there
is
bonna
the
woman
for
whose
career
i
desired
to
consult
the
prime
authority
cristoforo
da
costa
i
have
been
sketching
her
into
my
chapter
tonight
here
is
a
peasant
girl
caught
up
to
his
by
a
condottiere
brunoro
during
some
village

of

grotesque
forms
from
which
all
the
glamour

have
departed

infinite
awe
in

the
holy
communion
of
the
unconquerable
and
passionate
souls
i
wonder
it
has
not
come
down
to
us
as
one
of
the
great
of
the
world
elements
such
as
these
sway
the
morals
of
the
renaissance
but
i
am
taking
mcmurray
too
seriously
and
it
is
really
not
a
bad
idea
to
have
carlotta
taught
chapter
v
may
this
morning
a
letter
from
judith
do
not
laugh
at
me
she
writes
the
road
to
paris
is
paved
with
good
intentions
i
really
could
not
help
it
delphine
put
her
great
arm
round
my
sequestered
and
meditative
self
and
carried
it
off
bodily
and
here
it
is
in
the
midst
of
lunches
dinners
suppers
theatres
and
dances
and
if
you
laugh
you
will
make
me
humiliated
when
i
confess
that
it
is
thoroughly
enjoying
laugh
at
her
dear
woman
i
am
only
too
glad
that
she
can
fling
her
winter
garment
of
repentance
into
the
fires
of
paris
springtide
she
has
little
enough
enjoyment
in
friendless
london
fill
your
heart
with
it
my
dear
and
lay
up
a
store
for
use
in
the
dull
months
to
come
for
my
part
however
i
am
content
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
delphine
s
great
arm
i
must
write
to
judith
i
shall
have
to
explain
carlotta
but
for
that
i
think
i
shall
wait
until
she
becomes
a
little
more
explicable
in
dealing
with
women
it
is
well
to
employ
discrimination
you
are
never
quite
sure
whether
they
are
not
merely
simple
geese
or
the
most
complex
of
created
beings
perhaps
they
are
such
a
curious
admixture
that
you
can
not
tell
at
a
given
moment
which
side
the
simple
or
the
complex
you
are
touching
may
not
there
be
the
deepest
of
all
allegories
in
eve
standing
midway
between
the
innocent
apple
and
the
guileful
serpent
i
shall
have
to
see
more
of
carlotta
before
i
can
safely
explain
her
to
judith
at
any
rate
she
is
no
longer
attired
like
an
odalisque
of
the
second
empire
and
mcmurray
has
saved
her
from
the
lamentable
errors
of
taste
shown
by
the
female
mountebank
of
sixteenth
century
france
my
excellent
friend
safely
delivered
up
an
exhausted
and
bewildered
charge
at
seven
last
evening
assuring
me
that
her
task
had
been
easy
and
that
her
anticipations
of
it
being
the
day
of
her
life
had
been
fulfilled
it
had
been
like
dressing
a
doll
she
explained
beaming
an
edifying
pastime
for
an
adult
woman
i
did
not
utter
this
sentiment
for
she
would
rightly
have
styled
me
the
most
ungrateful
of
unhung
wretches
carlotta
then
had
followed
her
about
like
a
perambulatory
doll
upon
which
she
had
fitted
all
the
finery
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
apparently
the
atmosphere
of
the
great
shops
had
acted
on
carlotta
like
an
anaesthetic
she
had
moved
in
a
sensuous
dream
of
drapery
wherein
the
was
paralysed
the
only
articles
upon
which
in
an
unclouded
moment
she
had
set
her
heart
and
that
with
a
sudden
passion
of
covetousness
were
a
pair
of
red
shoes
and
a
cheap
red
parasol
you
have
no
idea
what
it
means
said
mcmurray
to
buy
that
a
woman
i
replied
that
i
had
a
respectful
distaste
for
transcendental
philosophy
from
a
paper
of
pins
to
an
she
continued
i
m
afraid
dear
mcmurray
an
is
not
the
superior
limit
of
a
woman
s
needs
said
i
i
wish
it
she
called
me
a
cynic
and
went
this
morning
carlotta
interrupted
me
in
my
work
will
seer
marcous
come
to
my
room
and
see
my
pretty
things
in
summer
blouse
and
plain
skirt
she
looked
as
demure
as
any
damsel
in
john
s
wood
she
hung
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
for
the
moment
i
felt
paternal
and
indulgently
consented
words
of
man
can
not
describe
the
mass
of
millinery
and
chiffonery
in
that
chamber
the
spaces
that
were
not
piled
high
with
vesture
gave
resting
spots
for
cardboard
boxes
and
antoinette
stood
in
a
corner
gazing
at
the
spoil
with
a
smile
of
beatific
idiocy
i
strode
through
the
cardboard
boxes
which
crackled
like
bracken
and
remained
dumb
as
a
fish
before
these
mysteries
carlotta
tried
on
hats
she
shewed
me
patent
leather
shoes
she
exhibited
blouses
and
petticoats
until
my
eyes
ached
she
brandished
something
in
her
hand
tell
me
if
i
must
wear
it
i
believe
the
sophisticated
call
it
them
mrs
mcmurray
says
all
ladies
do
but
we
never
wear
it
in
alexandretta
and
it
she
clasped
herself
pathetically
and
turned
her
great
imploring
eyes
on
me
faut
souffrir
pour
etre
i
said
but
with
the
figure
of
mademoiselle
it
is
stupid
cried
antoinette
it
is
outrageous
that
i
should
be
called
upon
to
express
an
opinion
on
such
matters
i
said
loftily
and
so
it
was
my
assertion
of
dignity
impressed
them
then
with
characteristic
frankness
my
young
lady
shakes
out
before
me
things
all
frills
embroidery
ribbons
diaphaneity
which
the
ordinary
man
only
examines
through
windows
when
a
philosophic
mood
induces
him
to
speculate
on
the
unfathomable
vanity
of
woman
beaux
dessous
breathed
antoinette
the
same
ejaculation
i
murmured
was
doubtless
uttered
by
an
enraptured
when
she
beheld
the
stout
linen
smocks
of
the
ladies
of
the
i
reflected
on
the
relativity
of
things
mundane
the
no
doubt
wore
some
horror
made
of
hemp
against
her
skin
if
carlotta
s
gossamer
follies
had
been
thrown
into
the
vagabond
court
of
the
queen
of
navarre
i
wonder
whether
those
delectable
stories
would
have
been
written
as
antoinette
does
not
understand
literary
english
and
as
carlotta
did
not
know
what
in
the
world
i
was
talking
about
i
was
master
of
the
conversational
situation
carlotta
went
to
the
and
returned
with
a
glutinous
mass
of
sweet
stuff
between
her
fingers
will
seer
marcous
have
some
it
is
i
declined
oh
she
said
tragically
disappointed
it
is
there
is
something
in
that
silly
creature
s
eyes
that
i
can
not
resist
she
put
the
abominable
morsel
into
my
mouth
it
was
far
too
sticky
for
me
to
hold
and
laughingly
licked
her
own
fingers
i
went
down
to
work
again
with
an
uneasy
feeling
of
imperilled
dignity
may
i
sent
her
word
that
i
would
take
her
for
a
drive
this
afternoon
she
was
to
be
ready
at
three
o
clock
it
will
be
wholesome
for
her
to
regard
her
outings
with
me
as
rare
occurrences
to
be
highly
valued
ordinarily
she
will
go
out
with
antoinette
for
the
present
at
least
as
she
did
yesterday
at
three
o
clock
stenson
informed
me
that
the
cab
was
at
the
door
go
up
and
call
mademoiselle
said
i
in
two
or
three
minutes
she
came
down
i
have
not
had
such
a
shock
in
my
life
i
uttered
exclamations
of
amazement
in
several
languages
i
have
never
seen
on
the
stage
or
off
such
a
figure
as
she
presented
her
cheeks
were
white
with
powder
her
lips
dyed
a
pomegranate
scarlet
her
eyebrows
and
lashes
blackened
in
her
ears
she
wore
large
earrings
she
entered
the
room
with
an
air
of
triumph
as
who
should
say
see
how
captivatingly
beautiful
i
am
at
my
stare
of
horror
her
face
fell
at
my
command
to
go
upstairs
and
wash
herself
clean
she
wept
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
cry
i
exclaimed
or
you
will
look
like
a
i
did
it
to
please
you
she
sobbed
it
is
only
the
lowest
class
of
who
paint
their
faces
in
england
said
i
and
you
know
what
they
are
in
they
came
to
s
wedding
said
carlotta
behind
her
handkerchief
but
all
our
ladies
do
this
when
they
want
to
make
themselves
look
nice
and
i
have
put
on
this
nasty
thing
that
hurts
me
just
to
please
seer
i
felt
i
had
been
brutal
she
must
have
spent
hours
over
her
adornment
yet
i
could
not
have
taken
her
out
into
the
street
she
looked
like
jezebel
who
without
her
paint
must
have
been
like
carlotta
a
remarkably
handsome
person
it
strikes
me
carlotta
said
i
that
you
will
find
england
is
alexandretta
upside
down
what
is
wrong
there
is
right
here
and
vice
versa
now
if
you
want
to
please
me
run
away
and
clean
yourself
and
take
off
those
barbaric
and
brummagem
she
went
and
was
absent
a
short
while
she
returned
in
dismay
water
would
not
get
it
off
i
rang
for
antoinette
but
antoinette
had
gone
out
it
being
too
delicate
a
matter
for
stenson
i
fetched
a
pot
of
vaseline
from
my
own
room
and
as
carlotta
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
with
my
own
hands
cleansed
carlotta
she
screamed
with
delight
thinking
it
vastly
amusing
her
emotions
are
facile
i
can
not
deny
that
it
amused
me
too
but
i
am
in
a
responsible
position
and
i
am
wondering
what
the
deuce
i
shall
be
doing
next
i
enjoyed
the
drive
to
richmond
where
i
gave
her
tea
at
the
star
and
garter
and
was
relieved
to
see
her
drink
normally
from
the
cup
instead
of
lapping
from
the
saucer
like
a
kitten
she
was
much
more
intelligent
than
during
our
first
drive
on
tuesday
the
streets
have
grown
more
familiar
and
the
traffic
does
not
make
her
head
ache
she
asks
me
the
ingenuous
questions
of
a
child
of
ten
the
tall
guardsmen
we
passed
particularly
aroused
her
enthusiasm
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
i
asked
her
if
she
would
like
me
to
buy
one
and
give
it
her
to
play
with
oh
would
you
seer
marcous
she
exclaimed
seizing
my
hand
rapturously
i
verily
believe
she
thought
i
was
in
earnest
for
when
i
turned
aside
my
jest
she
pouted
in
disappointment
and
declared
that
it
was
wrong
to
tell
lies
i
am
glad
you
have
some
elementary
notions
of
ethics
said
i
it
was
during
our
drive
that
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
her
where
she
had
procured
the
paint
and
earrings
she
explained
cheerfully
that
antoinette
had
supplied
the
funds
i
must
talk
seriously
to
antoinette
her
attitude
towards
carlotta
savours
too
much
of
idolatry
demoralisation
will
soon
set
in
and
the
utter
ruin
of
carlotta
and
my
digestion
will
be
the
result
i
must
also
make
carlotta
a
small
allowance
during
tea
she
said
to
me
suddenly
seer
marcous
is
not
married
i
said
no
she
asked
why
not
the
devil
seems
to
be
driving
all
womankind
to
ask
me
that
question
because
wives
are
an
unmitigated
nuisance
said
i
a
curious
smile
came
over
carlotta
s
face
it
was
as
knowing
as
dame
quickly
s
have
one
of
these
cakes
said
i
hurriedly
there
is
chocolate
outside
and
the
inside
is
of
she
bit
smiled
in
a
different
and
beatific
way
and
forgot
my
matrimonial
affairs
i
was
relieved
with
her
oriental
training
there
is
no
telling
what
carlotta
might
have
said
may
i
have
had
a
curious
interview
who
should
call
on
me
but
the
father
of
the
hapless
harry
robinson
my
first
question
was
a
natural
one
how
on
earth
did
he
connect
me
with
the
death
of
his
son
how
did
he
contrive
to
identify
me
as
the
befriender
of
the
young
turkish
girl
whose
interests
he
declared
were
the
object
of
his
visit
it
appeared
that
the
police
had
given
him
the
necessary
information
my
adventures
at
waterloo
having
rendered
their
tracing
of
carlotta
an
easy
matter
i
had
been
wondering
somewhat
at
the
meagre
newspaper
reports
of
the
inquest
no
mention
was
made
as
i
had
nervously
anticipated
of
the
mysterious
lady
for
whom
the
deceased
had
bought
a
ticket
at
alexandretta
and
with
whom
he
had
come
ashore
very
little
evidence
appeared
to
have
been
taken
and
the
jury
contented
themselves
with
giving
the
usual
verdict
of
temporary
insanity
i
touched
on
this
as
delicately
as
i
could
we
succeeded
in
hushing
things
up
said
my
visitor
an
old
man
with
whiskers
and
a
careworn
sensitive
face
i
have
some
influence
myself
and
his
wife
s
relations
his
wife
i
ejaculated
the
ways
of
men
are
further
than
ever
from
interpretation
the
fellow
was
actually
married
yes
he
sighed
that
is
what
would
have
made
such
a
terrible
scandal
her
relatives
are
powerful
people
we
averted
it
thank
heaven
and
his
poor
wife
will
never
know
my
boy
is
dead
no
public
investigation
into
motives
would
bring
him
back
to
life
i
murmured
words
of
condolence
he
must
have
been
out
of
his
mind
poor
lad
when
he
induced
the
girl
to
run
away
with
him
but
as
my
son
has
ruined
her
he
set
his
teeth
as
if
the
boy
s
sin
stabbed
him
i
must
look
after
her
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
point
said
i
he
smuggled
her
at
once
aboard
the
ship
and
seems
scarcely
to
have
said
how
d
ye
do
to
her
afterwards
that
is
the
mad
part
of
can
i
be
sure
i
would
stake
my
life
on
it
said
i
how
do
you
know
frankness
i
may
say
embarrassing
frankness
is
one
of
the
young
lady
s
he
looked
greatly
relieved
i
acquainted
him
with
carlotta
s
antecedents
and
outlined
the
part
i
had
played
in
the
story
then
said
he
i
will
see
the
child
back
to
her
home
i
will
take
her
there
myself
i
can
not
allow
you
any
longer
to
have
the
burden
of
befriending
her
when
it
is
my
duty
to
repair
my
boy
s
i
explained
to
him
the
terror
of
hamdi
effendi
s
clutches
and
told
him
of
my
promise
then
what
is
to
be
done
he
asked
if
any
kind
people
could
be
found
to
receive
her
into
their
family
and
bring
her
up
like
a
christian
i
should
hand
her
over
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
if
there
is
one
thing
i
do
not
require
in
this
house
it
is
an
idle
and
irresponsible
female
but
philanthropists
are
rare
who
will
take
her
i
m
afraid
i
m
not
prepared
to
do
i
never
dreamed
of
having
the
bad
taste
to
propose
it
said
i
i
merely
stated
the
only
alternative
to
my
i
should
be
willing
only
too
willing
to
contribute
towards
her
support
said
robinson
i
thanked
him
but
of
course
this
was
impossible
i
might
as
well
have
allowed
the
good
man
to
pay
my
gas
bill
i
know
of
a
nice
convent
home
kept
by
the
little
sisters
of
bridget
said
he
tentatively
if
it
were
bridget
herself
said
i
i
would
agree
with
pleasure
she
is
a
saint
for
whom
i
have
a
great
fascination
she
could
work
miracles
when
an
irish
chieftain
made
her
a
facetious
grant
of
as
much
land
as
she
could
cover
with
her
mantle
she
bade
four
of
her
nuns
each
take
a
corner
and
run
north
west
south
and
east
until
her
cloak
covered
several
roods
she
could
have
done
the
same
with
the
soul
of
carlotta
but
the
age
of
miracles
is
past
and
i
fear
the
little
sisters
would
only
break
their
gentle
hearts
over
her
she
is
an
extraordinary
i
know
i
ought
to
have
given
some
consideration
to
the
proposal
but
i
think
i
must
suffer
from
chronic
inflammation
of
the
logical
faculty
it
revolted
against
the
suggested
congruity
of
carlotta
and
the
little
sisters
of
bridget
what
can
she
be
like
asked
the
old
man
wonderingly
would
it
pain
you
to
see
her
i
asked
yes
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
would
but
perhaps
it
would
bring
me
nearer
to
my
unhappy
boy
he
seems
so
far
i
rang
the
bell
and
summoned
carlotta
perhaps
you
had
better
not
say
who
you
are
i
suggested
when
carlotta
entered
he
rose
and
looked
at
her
so
wistfully
this
carlotta
said
i
is
a
friend
of
mine
who
would
like
to
make
your
she
advanced
shyly
and
held
out
a
timid
hand
obviously
she
was
on
her
best
behaviour
i
thanked
heaven
she
had
tried
her
unsuccessful
experiment
of
powder
and
paint
on
my
vile
body
and
not
on
that
of
a
stranger
do
you
do
you
like
england
asked
the
old
man
oh
very
very
much
every
one
is
so
kind
to
me
it
is
a
nice
it
is
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
be
young
in
said
he
is
it
said
carlotta
with
the
simplicity
of
a
baby
the
very
but
is
it
not
good
to
be
old
in
no
country
is
good
for
the
old
man
sighed
and
took
his
leave
i
accompanied
him
to
the
front
door
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
sir
marcus
she
moves
me
strangely
i
never
expected
such
sweet
innocence
for
my
boy
s
sake
i
would
take
her
in
but
his
mother
knows
nothing
about
it
save
that
the
boy
is
dead
it
would
kill
the
tears
rolled
down
the
old
man
s
cheeks
i
grasped
him
by
the
hand
she
shall
come
to
no
manner
of
harm
beneath
my
roof
said
carlotta
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
she
looked
at
me
in
a
perplexed
pitiful
way
seer
marcous
yes
am
i
to
marry
him
marry
whom
that
old
gentleman
i
must
if
you
tell
me
but
i
do
not
want
to
marry
it
took
me
a
minute
or
two
to
arrive
at
her
oriental
point
of
view
no
woman
could
be
shown
off
to
a
man
except
in
the
light
of
a
possible
bride
i
think
it
sometimes
good
to
administer
a
shock
to
carlotta
by
way
of
treatment
do
you
know
who
that
old
gentleman
was
said
i
it
was
harry
s
oh
she
said
with
a
grimace
i
am
sorry
i
was
so
nice
to
what
the
deuce
am
i
to
do
with
her
i
lectured
her
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
ethics
of
the
situation
i
think
i
only
succeeded
in
giving
her
the
impression
that
i
was
in
a
bad
temper
so
much
did
i
sympathise
with
harry
that
i
forbore
to
acquaint
her
with
the
fact
that
he
was
a
married
man
when
he
enticed
her
away
from
alexandretta
chapter
vi
june
sebastian
pasquale
dined
with
me
this
evening
antoinette
forgetful
of
idolatrous
practices
devoted
the
concentration
of
her
being
to
the
mysteries
of
her
true
religion
the
excellence
of
the
result
affected
pasquale
so
strongly
that
with
his
customary
disregard
of
convention
he
insisted
on
antoinette
being
summoned
to
receive
his
congratulations
he
rose
made
her
a
bow
as
if
she
were
a
marquise
of
days
it
is
a
meal
said
he
bunching
up
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
and
kissing
them
open
that
one
should
have
taken
not
sitting
but
you
stole
that
from
heine
said
i
when
the
enraptured
creature
had
gone
and
you
gave
it
out
to
antoinette
as
if
it
were
your
my
good
ordeyne
said
he
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
giving
anything
authentic
to
a
woman
you
know
much
more
about
the
matter
than
i
do
i
replied
and
pasquale
laughed
it
has
been
a
pleasure
to
see
him
again
a
creature
of
abounding
vitality
whom
time
can
not
alter
he
is
as
as
when
he
was
a
boy
and
as
i
don
t
know
how
his
consciousness
could
have
arrived
at
appreciation
of
antoinette
s
cooking
for
he
talked
all
through
dinner
giving
me
an
account
of
his
mirific
adventures
in
foreign
cities
among
other
things
he
had
been
playing
juvenile
lead
it
appears
in
the
comic
opera
of
bulgarian
politics
i
also
heard
of
the
viennese
dancer
my
own
little
chronicle
which
he
insisted
on
my
unfolding
compared
with
his
was
that
of
a
caged
canary
compared
with
a
sparrowhawk
s
besides
i
am
not
so
expansive
as
pasquale
and
on
certain
matters
i
am
silent
he
also
gesticulates
freely
a
thing
which
is
totally
foreign
to
my
nature
as
judith
would
say
he
has
a
temperament
his
moustaches
curl
fiercely
upward
until
the
points
are
nearly
on
a
level
with
his
flashing
dark
eyes
another
point
of
dissimilarity
between
us
is
that
he
seems
to
have
been
poured
molten
into
his
clothes
whereas
mine
hang
as
from
pegs
clumsily
arranged
about
my
person
by
no
conceivable
freak
of
outer
circumstance
could
i
have
the
adventures
of
pasquale
and
yet
he
thinks
them
tame
lord
if
i
found
myself
hatching
conspiracies
in
sofia
on
a
nest
made
of
loaded
revolvers
i
should
feel
that
the
wild
whirl
of
bedlam
had
broken
loose
around
me
but
man
alive
i
cried
what
in
the
name
of
tornadoes
do
you
want
i
want
to
fight
said
he
the
earth
has
grown
too
grey
and
peaceful
life
is
anaemic
we
need
colour
good
red
splashes
of
it
good
wholesome
said
i
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
into
a
berlin
cafe
and
pull
the
noses
of
all
the
lieutenants
you
see
there
in
that
way
you
ll
get
as
much
gore
as
your
heart
could
by
jove
said
he
springing
to
his
feet
what
a
cause
for
a
man
to
devote
his
life
to
the
extermination
of
prussian
lieutenants
i
leaned
back
in
my
it
was
after
dinner
and
smiled
at
his
vehemence
the
ordinary
man
does
not
leap
about
like
that
during
digestion
you
would
have
been
happy
as
an
uscoque
said
i
i
have
just
finished
the
prim
narrative
what
s
that
he
asked
i
told
him
the
interesting
thing
about
the
uscoques
i
added
is
that
they
were
a
pirate
society
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
which
priests
and
monks
and
greengrocers
and
women
and
children
the
general
public
in
fact
of
senga
took
shares
and
were
paid
dividends
they
were
also
a
religious
people
and
the
setting
out
of
the
pirate
fleet
at
the
festivals
of
easter
and
christmas
was
attended
by
ecclesiastical
ceremony
then
they
scoured
the
high
seas
captured
argosies
murdered
the
crews
their
only
weapons
were
hatchets
and
daggers
and
arquebuses
landed
on
undefended
shores
ravaged
villages
and
carried
off
comely
maidens
to
replenish
their
stock
of
womenkind
at
home
they
must
have
been
a
live
lot
of
what
a
old
brigand
you
are
cried
pasquale
who
during
my
speech
had
been
examining
the
carpet
by
the
side
of
his
chair
i
laughed
hasn
t
a
phase
of
the
duality
of
our
nature
ever
struck
you
we
have
a
primary
or
everyday
nature
a
thing
of
habit
tradition
circumstance
and
we
also
have
a
secondary
nature
which
clamours
for
various
sensations
and
is
quite
contented
with
vicarious
gratification
there
are
delicately
fibred
novelists
who
satisfy
a
sort
of
secondary
berserkism
by
writing
books
whose
pages
reek
with
bloodshed
the
most
placid
benevolent
paterfamilias
i
know
a
man
who
thinks
it
cruel
to
eat
live
oysters
has
a
curious
passion
for
crime
and
gratifies
it
by
turning
his
study
into
a
of
murderers
relics
from
the
of
a
notorious
criminal
he
can
savour
exquisitely
morbid
emotions
while
the
on
an
assassin
s
knife
fill
him
with
the
delicious
lust
of
slaughter
in
the
same
way
predestined
spinsters
obtain
vicarious
enjoyment
of
the
tender
passion
by
reading
highly
coloured
just
as
that
philosophical
old
stick
sir
marcus
ordeyne
dus
from
this
sort
of
thing
said
pasquale
and
he
fished
from
the
side
of
his
chair
and
held
up
by
the
tip
of
a
monstrous
heel
the
most
audacious
red
satin
slipper
i
ever
saw
i
eyed
the
thing
with
profound
disgust
i
would
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
for
it
to
have
vanished
in
its
red
satin
essence
it
was
reprehensible
and
in
its
feminine
assertion
it
was
compromising
how
did
it
come
there
i
conjectured
that
carlotta
must
have
been
trespassing
in
the
and
dropped
it
in
her
flight
when
she
heard
me
enter
the
house
before
dinner
pasquale
held
it
up
and
regarded
me
quizzically
i
pretend
to
no
austerity
of
morals
but
a
burglar
unjustly
accused
of
theft
suffers
acuter
qualms
of
indignation
than
if
he
were
a
virtuous
person
i
regretted
not
having
asked
pasquale
to
dinner
at
the
club
i
particularly
did
not
intend
to
explain
carlotta
to
pasquale
in
fact
i
see
no
reason
at
all
for
me
to
proclaim
her
to
my
acquaintance
she
is
merely
an
accident
of
my
establishment
i
rose
and
rang
the
bell
that
slipper
said
i
does
not
belong
to
me
and
it
certainly
ought
not
to
be
pasquale
surrendered
it
to
my
outstretched
hand
it
must
fit
a
remarkably
pretty
foot
said
he
i
assure
you
my
dear
pasquale
i
replied
dryly
i
have
never
looked
at
the
foot
that
it
may
nor
had
i
a
row
of
pink
toes
is
not
a
foot
stenson
said
i
when
my
man
appeared
take
this
to
miss
carlotta
and
say
with
my
compliments
she
should
not
have
left
it
in
the
stenson
thinking
i
had
rung
for
whisky
had
brought
up
decanter
and
glasses
as
he
set
the
tray
upon
the
small
table
i
noticed
pasquale
look
with
some
curiosity
at
my
man
s
impassive
face
but
he
said
nothing
more
about
the
slipper
i
poured
out
his
whisky
and
soda
he
drank
a
deep
draught
curled
up
his
swaggering
moustache
and
suddenly
broke
into
one
of
his
disconcerting
peals
of
laughter
i
haven
t
told
you
of
the
grefin
von
wentzel
i
don
t
know
what
put
her
into
my
head
there
has
been
nothing
like
it
since
the
world
began
mind
you
a
real
live
aristocratic
grefin
with
a
hundred
quarterings
he
proceeded
to
relate
a
most
scandalous
but
highly
amusing
story
an
amazing
incredible
tale
but
it
seemed
familiar
that
said
i
at
last
is
incident
for
incident
a
scene
out
of
histoire
comique
de
never
heard
of
it
said
pasquale
flashing
it
was
the
first
french
novel
of
manners
published
about
and
written
by
a
man
called
sorel
i
don
t
dream
of
accusing
you
of
plagiarism
my
dear
fellow
that
s
absurd
but
the
ridiculous
coincidence
struck
me
you
and
the
grefin
and
the
rest
of
you
were
merely
reenacting
a
three
hundred
year
old
rubbish
said
pasquale
i
ll
show
you
said
i
after
wandering
for
a
moment
or
two
round
my
shelves
i
remembered
that
the
book
was
in
the
i
left
pasquale
and
went
downstairs
i
knew
it
was
on
one
of
the
top
shelves
near
the
ceiling
now
my
is
lit
by
one
shaded
electrolier
over
the
table
so
that
the
walls
of
the
room
are
in
deep
shadow
this
has
annoyed
me
many
times
when
i
have
been
i
really
must
have
some
top
lights
put
in
to
stand
on
a
chair
and
burn
wax
matches
in
order
to
find
a
particular
book
is
ignominious
and
uncomfortable
the
successive
illumination
of
four
wax
matches
did
not
shed
itself
upon
histoire
comique
de
if
there
is
one
thing
that
frets
me
more
than
another
it
is
not
to
be
able
to
lay
my
hand
upon
a
book
i
knew
francion
was
there
on
the
top
shelves
and
rather
than
leave
it
undiscovered
i
would
have
spent
the
whole
night
in
search
i
suppose
every
one
has
a
harmless
lunacy
this
is
mine
i
must
have
hunted
for
that
book
for
twenty
minutes
pulling
out
whole
blocks
of
volumes
and
peering
with
lighted
matches
behind
until
my
hands
were
covered
with
dust
at
last
i
found
it
had
fallen
to
the
rear
of
a
ragged
regiment
of
french
novels
and
in
triumph
i
took
it
to
the
area
of
light
on
the
table
and
turned
up
the
scene
in
question
keeping
my
thumb
in
the
place
i
returned
to
the
i
m
sorry
to
have
i
began
i
stopped
short
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
there
conversing
with
pasquale
and
lolling
on
the
sofa
as
if
she
had
known
him
for
years
was
carlotta
she
must
have
seen
righteous
disapprobation
on
my
face
for
she
came
running
up
to
me
you
see
i
ve
made
miss
carlotta
s
acquaintance
said
pasquale
so
i
perceive
said
i
stenson
told
me
you
wanted
me
to
come
to
the
in
my
red
slippers
said
carlotta
i
am
afraid
stenson
must
have
misdelivered
my
message
said
i
then
you
do
not
want
me
at
all
and
i
must
go
away
oh
those
eyes
i
am
growing
so
tired
of
them
i
hesitated
and
was
lost
please
let
me
stay
and
talk
to
mr
pasquale
i
corrected
she
echoed
my
words
with
a
cooing
laugh
and
taking
my
consent
for
granted
curled
herself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
i
resumed
my
seat
with
a
sigh
it
would
have
been
boorish
to
turn
her
out
this
is
much
nicer
than
alexandretta
isn
t
it
said
pasquale
familiarly
and
sir
marcus
is
an
improvement
on
hamdi
oh
yes
seer
marcous
lets
me
do
whatever
i
like
said
carlotta
i
m
shot
if
i
do
i
exclaimed
the
confinement
of
your
existence
in
the
east
makes
you
exaggerate
the
comparative
immunity
from
restriction
which
you
enjoy
in
i
notice
that
carlotta
is
always
impressed
when
i
use
high
sounding
words
still
if
you
could
make
love
over
garden
walls
you
must
have
had
a
pretty
slack
time
even
in
alexandretta
said
pasquale
obviously
carlotta
had
saved
me
the
trouble
of
explaining
her
i
once
met
our
friend
hamdi
pasquale
continued
he
was
the
politest
old
ruffian
that
ever
had
a
long
nose
and
was
pitted
with
yes
yes
cried
carlotta
delighted
that
is
is
there
any
disreputable
foreigner
that
you
are
not
familiar
with
i
asked
somewhat
sarcastically
i
hope
not
he
laughed
you
must
know
i
had
got
into
a
deuce
of
a
row
at
aleppo
about
eighteen
months
ago
and
had
to
take
to
my
heels
alexandretta
is
the
port
of
aleppo
and
hamdi
is
a
sort
of
boss
policeman
he
is
very
he
ought
to
be
my
interview
with
him
cost
me
a
thousand
pounds
the
scoundrel
he
is
a
shocking
bad
man
said
carlotta
gravely
i
m
afraid
it
is
pasquale
who
is
the
shocking
bad
man
i
said
amused
what
had
you
been
doing
in
aleppo
said
he
english
are
very
wicked
when
they
go
to
syria
she
remarked
how
can
you
possibly
know
i
said
oh
i
know
replied
carlotta
with
a
toss
of
her
chin
my
friend
said
pasquale
lighting
a
cigarette
i
have
travelled
much
in
the
east
and
have
had
considerable
adventures
by
the
way
and
i
can
assure
you
that
what
the
oriental
lady
doesn
t
know
about
essential
things
is
not
worth
knowing
their
life
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
is
a
concentration
of
all
their
faculties
mortal
and
immortal
upon
the
two
vital
questions
digestion
and
what
is
sex
asked
carlotta
it
is
the
fundamental
blunder
of
creation
said
i
i
do
not
understand
said
carlotta
nobody
tries
to
understand
sir
marcus
said
pasquale
cheerfully
we
just
let
him
drivel
on
until
he
is
aware
no
one
is
seer
marcous
is
very
wise
said
carlotta
in
serious
defence
of
her
lord
and
master
all
day
he
reads
in
big
books
and
writes
on
i
have
been
wondering
since
whether
that
is
not
as
ironical
a
judgment
as
ever
was
passed
am
i
wise
is
wisdom
attained
by
reading
in
big
books
and
writing
on
paper
solomon
remarks
that
wisdom
dwells
with
prudence
and
finds
out
knowledge
of
witty
inventions
that
the
wisdom
of
the
prudent
is
to
understand
his
way
that
wisdom
and
understanding
keep
one
from
the
strange
woman
and
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words
now
i
have
not
been
saved
from
the
strange
young
woman
who
has
begun
to
flatter
with
her
words
i
don
t
in
the
least
understand
my
way
since
i
have
no
notion
what
i
shall
do
with
her
and
in
taking
her
in
and
letting
her
loll
upon
my
sofa
of
evenings
so
as
to
show
off
her
red
slippers
to
my
guests
i
have
thrown
prudence
to
the
winds
and
my
only
witty
invention
was
the
idea
of
teaching
her
typewriting
which
is
futile
if
the
philosophy
of
the
excellent
aphorist
is
sound
i
certainly
have
not
much
wisdom
to
boast
of
and
none
of
the
big
books
will
tell
me
what
a
wise
man
would
have
done
had
he
met
carlotta
in
the
embankment
gardens
i
did
not
think
however
that
my
wisdom
was
a
proper
subject
for
discussion
i
jerked
back
the
conversation
by
asking
carlotta
why
she
called
hamdi
effendi
a
shocking
bad
man
her
reply
was
startling
my
mother
told
me
she
used
to
cry
all
day
long
she
was
sorry
she
married
poor
thing
said
i
did
he
her
oh
she
had
too
and
she
was
no
longer
pretty
so
hamdi
took
other
wives
and
she
did
not
like
them
they
were
so
fat
and
cruel
she
used
to
tell
me
i
must
kill
myself
before
i
married
a
turk
hamdi
was
going
to
make
me
marry
mohammed
ali
one
two
years
ago
but
he
died
when
i
said
i
was
so
glad
that
seems
to
be
her
usual
formula
of
acknowledgment
of
news
relating
to
the
disasters
of
her
acquaintance
hamdi
shut
me
up
in
a
dark
room
then
he
said
i
must
marry
mustapha
that
is
why
i
ran
away
with
harry
see
oh
hamdi
is
shocking
from
this
and
from
other
carlotta
has
thrown
on
her
upbringing
i
can
realise
the
poor
pretty
baby
of
a
thing
that
was
her
mother
taking
the
line
of
least
resistance
the
husband
dead
and
the
babe
in
her
womb
and
entering
the
shelter
offered
by
the
amorous
turk
and
i
can
picture
her
during
the
fourteen
years
of
her
imprisoned
life
the
disillusion
the
the
despair
no
wonder
the
invertebrate
soul
could
do
no
more
for
her
daughter
than
teach
her
monosyllabic
english
and
the
rudiments
of
reading
and
writing
doubtless
she
babbled
of
western
life
with
its
freedom
and
joyousness
for
women
but
four
years
have
elapsed
since
her
death
and
her
stories
are
only
elusive
memories
in
carlotta
s
mind
it
is
strange
that
among
the
deadening
influences
of
the
harem
she
has
kept
the
hereditary
alertness
of
the
englishwoman
she
has
a
baby
mouth
it
is
true
she
pleads
to
you
with
the
eyes
of
a
dog
her
pretty
ways
are
those
of
a
young
child
but
she
has
not
the
dull
soulless
sensual
look
of
the
turkish
woman
such
as
i
have
seen
in
cairo
through
the
transparent
veils
in
them
there
is
no
attraction
save
of
the
flesh
and
that
only
for
the
male
who
deformity
aside
reckons
women
as
merely
so
much
cubical
content
of
animated
matter
placed
by
allah
at
his
disposal
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
desires
and
the
procreation
of
children
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
understand
an
englishman
falling
in
love
with
a
turkish
woman
but
i
can
quite
understand
him
falling
in
love
with
carlotta
the
hereditary
qualities
are
there
though
they
have
been
forced
into
the
channel
of
sex
and
become
a
sort
of
diabolical
witchery
whereof
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
she
is
conscious
for
all
that
i
don
t
think
she
can
have
a
soul
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
she
hasn
t
and
i
don
t
like
having
my
convictions
disturbed
until
i
saw
her
perched
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
with
her
legs
tucked
up
under
her
and
the
light
playing
a
game
of
magic
amid
the
reds
and
golds
and
browns
of
her
hair
while
she
cheerily
discoursed
to
us
of
hamdi
s
villainy
i
never
noticed
the
dull
decorum
of
this
room
i
was
struck
with
the
decorative
value
of
mere
woman
i
must
break
myself
of
the
habit
of
wandering
off
on
a
meditative
tangent
to
the
circle
of
conversation
i
was
brought
back
by
hearing
pasquale
say
so
you
re
going
to
marry
an
englishman
it
s
all
fixed
and
settled
eh
of
course
laughed
carlotta
have
you
made
up
your
mind
what
he
is
to
be
like
i
could
see
the
unconscionable
don
juan
instinctively
preen
himself
peacock
fashion
i
am
going
to
marry
seer
marcous
said
carlotta
calmly
she
made
this
announcement
not
as
a
jest
not
as
a
wish
but
as
the
commonplace
statement
of
a
fact
there
was
a
moment
of
stupefied
silence
pasquale
who
had
just
struck
a
match
to
light
a
cigarette
stared
at
me
and
let
the
flame
burn
his
fingers
i
stared
at
carlotta
speechless
the
colossal
impudence
of
it
i
am
sorry
to
contradict
you
said
i
at
last
with
some
acidity
but
you
are
going
to
do
no
such
i
am
not
going
to
marry
you
certainly
oh
said
carlotta
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
pasquale
rose
brought
his
heels
together
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
made
her
a
low
bow
will
you
have
me
instead
of
this
stray
bit
of
stonehenge
very
well
said
carlotta
i
seized
pasquale
by
the
arm
for
goodness
sake
don
t
jest
with
her
she
has
about
as
much
sense
of
humour
as
a
prehistoric
she
thinks
you
have
made
her
a
serious
offer
of
he
made
her
another
bow
you
hear
what
sir
granite
says
he
forbids
our
union
if
i
married
you
without
his
consent
he
would
flay
me
alive
dip
me
in
boiling
oil
and
read
me
aloud
his
history
of
renaissance
morals
so
i
m
afraid
it
is
no
then
i
mustn
t
marry
him
either
asked
carlotta
looking
at
me
no
i
cried
you
are
not
going
to
marry
anybody
you
seem
to
have
hymenomania
people
don
t
marry
in
this
casual
way
in
england
they
think
over
it
for
a
couple
of
years
and
then
they
come
together
in
a
sober
respectable
they
marry
at
leisure
and
repent
in
haste
interposed
pasquale
precisely
said
i
what
we
call
a
repentance
said
pasquale
i
told
you
this
poor
child
had
no
sense
of
humour
i
objected
you
might
as
well
kill
yourself
as
marry
without
you
are
not
going
to
marry
anybody
carlotta
said
i
until
you
can
see
a
what
is
a
joke
inquired
carlotta
mr
pasquale
asked
you
to
marry
him
he
didn
t
mean
it
that
was
a
joke
it
was
enormously
funny
and
you
should
have
then
i
must
laugh
when
any
one
asks
me
to
marry
him
as
loud
as
you
can
said
i
you
are
so
strange
in
england
sighed
carlotta
i
smiled
for
i
did
not
want
to
make
her
unhappy
and
i
spoke
to
her
intelligibly
well
well
when
you
have
quite
learned
all
the
english
ways
i
ll
try
and
find
you
a
nice
husband
now
you
had
better
go
to
she
retired
quite
consoled
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
pasquale
shook
his
head
at
me
wasted
criminally
wasted
what
that
he
answered
pointing
to
the
door
that
bundle
of
bewildering
that
said
i
is
an
horrible
infliction
which
only
my
cultivated
sense
of
altruism
enables
me
to
her
name
ought
to
be
why
i
asked
said
he
certainly
pasquale
has
a
pretty
wit
and
i
admire
it
as
i
admire
most
of
his
brilliant
qualities
but
i
fail
to
see
the
aptness
of
this
last
gibe
at
the
club
this
afternoon
i
picked
up
an
entertaining
french
novel
called
felons
des
on
the
illustrated
cover
was
a
row
of
undraped
damsels
sitting
in
and
the
text
of
the
book
went
to
show
how
it
was
the
hero
s
ambition
to
make
a
rosary
of
these
pearls
now
i
am
a
dull
pig
why
because
i
do
not
add
carlotta
to
my
rosary
i
never
heard
such
a
monstrous
thing
in
my
life
to
begin
with
i
have
no
rosary
i
wish
i
had
not
read
that
french
novel
i
wish
i
had
not
gone
downstairs
to
hunt
for
its
seventeenth
century
ancestor
i
wish
i
had
given
pasquale
dinner
at
the
club
it
is
all
the
fault
of
antoinette
why
can
t
she
cook
in
a
unedifying
way
all
this
comes
from
having
in
the
house
a
woman
whose
soul
is
in
the
chapter
vii
july
she
has
been
now
over
five
weeks
under
my
roof
and
i
have
put
off
the
evil
day
of
explaining
her
to
judith
and
judith
returns
i
know
it
is
odd
for
a
philosophic
bachelor
to
maintain
in
his
establishment
a
young
and
detached
female
of
prepossessing
appearance
for
the
oddity
i
care
not
two
pins
son
but
the
question
that
exercises
me
occasionally
is
in
what
category
are
my
relations
with
carlotta
to
be
classified
i
do
not
regard
her
as
a
daughter
still
less
as
a
sister
not
even
as
a
deceased
wife
s
sister
for
a
secretary
she
is
too
abysmally
ignorant
too
grotesquely
incapable
what
she
knows
would
be
made
to
kick
the
beam
against
the
erudition
of
a
yet
she
must
be
classified
somehow
i
must
allude
to
her
as
something
at
present
she
fills
the
place
in
the
house
of
a
pretty
and
expensive
persian
cat
and
like
a
cat
she
has
made
herself
serenely
at
home
a
governess
a
girl
who
i
am
afraid
takes
too
humorous
a
view
of
the
position
comes
of
mornings
to
instruct
carlotta
in
the
rudiments
of
education
when
engaging
miss
griggs
i
told
her
she
must
be
patient
firm
and
above
all
she
replied
that
she
made
a
professional
specialty
of
these
qualities
one
of
her
present
pupils
being
a
young
lady
of
the
alhambra
ballet
who
desires
the
particular
shade
of
cultivation
that
will
match
a
new
brougham
she
teaches
carlotta
to
spell
to
hold
a
knife
and
fork
and
corrects
such
erroneous
opinions
as
that
the
sky
is
an
inverted
bowl
over
a
nice
flat
earth
and
that
the
sun
moon
and
stars
are
a
sort
of
electric
light
installation
put
into
the
cosmos
to
illuminate
alexandretta
and
the
regent
s
park
her
religious
instruction
i
myself
shall
attend
to
when
she
is
sufficiently
advanced
to
understand
my
teaching
at
present
she
is
a
mohammedan
if
she
is
anything
and
believes
firmly
in
allah
i
consider
that
a
working
theism
is
quite
enough
for
a
young
woman
in
her
position
to
go
on
with
in
the
afternoon
she
walks
out
with
antoinette
once
she
stole
forth
by
herself
enjoyed
herself
hugely
for
a
short
time
got
lost
and
was
brought
back
thoroughly
frightened
by
a
policeman
i
wonder
what
the
policeman
thought
of
her
the
rest
of
the
day
she
looks
at
and
works
embroidery
she
is
making
an
elaborate
which
will
give
her
harmless
occupation
for
a
couple
of
years
for
an
hour
every
evening
when
i
am
at
home
she
comes
into
the
and
drinks
coffee
with
me
and
listens
to
my
improving
conversation
i
take
this
opportunity
to
rebuke
her
for
faults
committed
during
the
day
or
to
commend
her
for
especial
good
behaviour
i
also
supplement
the
instruction
in
things
in
general
that
is
given
her
by
the
excellent
miss
griggs
oddly
enough
i
am
beginning
to
look
forward
to
these
evening
hours
she
is
so
docile
so
so
spontaneous
if
she
has
a
pain
in
her
stomach
she
says
so
with
the
most
engaging
frankness
sometimes
i
think
of
her
only
in
pasquale
s
words
as
a
bundle
of
fascination
and
forget
that
she
has
no
soul
nearly
always
however
something
happens
to
remind
me
she
loves
me
to
tell
her
stories
the
other
night
i
solemnly
related
the
history
of
cinderella
she
was
enchanted
it
gave
me
the
idea
of
setting
her
to
read
lamb
s
tales
from
i
was
turning
this
over
in
my
mind
while
she
chewed
the
cud
of
her
enjoyment
when
she
suddenly
asked
whether
i
would
like
to
hear
a
turkish
story
she
knew
lots
of
nice
funny
stories
i
bade
her
proceed
she
curled
herself
up
in
her
favourite
attitude
on
the
sofa
and
began
i
did
not
allow
her
to
finish
that
tale
had
i
done
so
i
should
have
been
a
monster
of
depravity
compared
with
it
the
worst
of
scheherazade
s
in
burton
s
translation
were
milk
and
water
for
a
nunnery
she
seemed
nonplussed
when
i
told
her
to
stop
are
oriental
ladies
in
the
habit
of
telling
such
stories
i
asked
why
yes
she
replied
with
a
candid
air
of
astonishment
it
is
a
funny
there
is
nothing
funny
whatever
in
it
said
i
a
girl
like
you
oughtn
t
to
know
of
the
existence
of
such
why
not
asked
carlotta
i
am
always
being
caught
up
by
her
questions
i
tried
to
explain
but
it
was
difficult
if
i
had
told
her
that
a
maiden
s
mind
ought
to
be
as
pure
as
the
dewy
rose
she
would
not
have
understood
me
probably
she
would
have
thought
me
a
fool
and
indeed
i
am
inclined
to
question
whether
it
is
an
advantage
to
a
maiden
s
after
career
to
be
in
her
unsophistication
in
order
to
play
tunes
indifferently
well
on
the
piano
she
undergoes
the
weary
training
of
many
years
but
she
is
called
upon
to
display
the
somewhat
more
important
accomplishment
of
bringing
children
into
the
world
without
an
hour
s
educational
preparation
the
difficulty
is
where
to
draw
the
line
between
this
dewy
but
often
disastrous
ignorance
and
carlotta
s
knowledge
i
find
it
a
most
delicate
and
embarrassing
problem
in
fact
the
problems
connected
with
this
young
woman
seem
endless
yet
they
do
not
disturb
me
as
much
as
i
had
anticipated
i
really
believe
i
should
miss
my
pretty
persian
cat
a
man
must
be
devoid
of
all
aesthetic
sense
to
deny
that
she
is
delightful
to
look
at
and
she
has
a
thousand
innocent
coquetries
and
cajoling
ways
she
has
a
manner
of
holding
chocolate
creams
to
her
white
teeth
and
talking
to
you
at
the
same
time
which
is
peculiarly
fascinating
and
she
must
have
some
sense
she
asked
me
what
i
was
writing
i
replied
a
history
of
the
morals
of
the
what
are
morals
and
what
is
the
renaissance
asked
carlotta
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
a
profound
question
which
philosophers
and
historians
have
wasted
vain
lives
in
trying
to
answer
i
perceive
that
i
too
must
try
to
answer
it
with
a
certain
amount
of
definition
i
have
spent
the
evening
remodelling
my
introduction
so
as
to
define
the
two
terms
axiomatically
with
my
subsequent
argument
and
i
find
it
greatly
improved
now
this
is
due
to
carlotta
the
quantity
of
chocolate
creams
the
child
eats
can
not
be
good
for
her
digestion
i
must
see
to
this
july
a
telegram
from
judith
to
say
she
postpones
her
return
to
monday
i
have
been
longing
to
see
the
dear
woman
again
and
i
am
greatly
disappointed
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
respite
from
an
explanation
that
grows
more
difficult
every
day
i
hate
myself
for
the
sense
of
relief
this
morning
came
an
evening
dress
for
carlotta
which
has
taken
a
month
in
the
making
this
i
am
given
to
understand
is
delirious
speed
for
a
london
to
celebrate
the
occasion
i
engaged
a
box
at
the
empire
for
this
evening
and
invited
her
to
dine
with
me
i
sent
a
note
of
invitation
round
to
mcmurray
carlotta
did
not
come
down
at
seven
we
waited
at
last
mcmurray
went
up
to
the
room
and
presently
returned
shepherding
a
shy
blushing
awkward
piteous
young
person
who
had
evidently
been
crying
my
friend
signed
to
me
to
take
no
notice
i
attributed
the
child
s
lack
of
gaiety
to
the
ordeal
of
sitting
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
at
a
civilised
she
scarcely
spoke
and
scarcely
ate
i
complimented
her
on
her
appearance
and
she
looked
beseechingly
at
me
as
if
i
were
scolding
her
after
dinner
mcmurray
told
me
the
reason
of
her
distress
she
had
found
carlotta
in
tears
never
could
she
face
me
in
that
low
cut
evening
bodice
it
outraged
her
modesty
it
could
not
be
the
practice
of
european
women
to
bare
themselves
so
immodestly
before
men
it
was
only
the
evidence
of
her
visitor
s
own
plump
neck
and
shoulders
that
convinced
her
and
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
downstairs
in
an
agony
of
when
we
entered
the
box
at
the
empire
a
troupe
of
female
acrobats
were
doing
their
turn
carlotta
uttered
a
gasp
of
dismay
blushed
burning
red
and
shrank
back
to
the
door
there
is
no
pretence
about
carlotta
she
was
shocked
to
the
roots
of
her
being
they
are
naked
she
said
quiveringly
for
heaven
s
sake
explain
said
i
to
mcmurray
and
i
beat
a
hasty
retreat
to
the
promenade
when
i
returned
carlotta
had
been
soothed
down
she
was
watching
some
performing
dogs
with
intense
wonderment
and
delight
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
she
sat
the
exiguity
of
costume
in
the
ballet
caused
her
indeed
to
glance
in
a
frightened
sort
of
way
at
mcmurray
who
reassured
her
with
a
friendly
smile
but
the
music
and
the
maze
of
motion
and
the
dazzle
of
colour
soon
held
her
senses
captive
and
when
the
curtain
came
down
she
sighed
like
one
awaking
from
a
dream
as
we
drove
home
she
asked
me
is
it
like
that
all
day
long
oh
please
to
let
me
live
there
a
nice
english
girl
of
eighteen
would
not
flaunt
unconcerned
about
my
in
a
shameless
and
crinkle
up
her
toes
in
front
of
me
still
less
would
she
tell
me
outrageous
stories
but
she
will
wear
dresses
and
gaze
at
ladies
in
tights
without
the
ghost
of
an
immodest
thought
i
was
right
when
i
told
carlotta
england
was
alexandretta
what
is
immoral
here
is
moral
there
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
absolute
morality
i
am
very
glad
this
has
happened
it
shows
me
that
carlotta
is
not
devoid
of
the
better
kind
of
feminine
instincts
chapter
viii
july
judith
has
come
back
i
have
seen
her
and
i
have
explained
carlotta
all
day
long
i
felt
like
a
respectable
person
about
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
for
being
drunk
and
disorderly
now
i
have
the
uneasy
satisfaction
of
having
been
let
off
with
a
caution
i
am
innocent
but
i
mustn
t
do
it
again
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
room
judith
embraced
me
and
said
a
number
of
foolish
things
i
responded
to
the
best
of
my
ability
it
is
not
usual
for
our
quiet
lake
of
affection
to
be
visited
by
such
tornadoes
oh
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
to
be
back
with
you
again
i
have
longed
for
you
i
couldn
t
write
it
i
did
not
know
i
could
long
for
any
one
so
i
have
missed
you
immensely
my
dear
judith
said
i
she
looked
at
me
queerly
for
a
moment
then
with
a
radiant
smile
i
love
you
for
not
going
into
transports
like
a
frenchman
oh
i
am
tired
of
frenchmen
you
are
my
good
english
marcus
and
worth
all
masculine
paris
put
i
thank
you
my
dear
for
the
compliment
said
i
but
surely
you
must
to
me
you
are
worth
the
masculine
universe
said
judith
and
she
seated
me
by
her
side
on
the
sofa
held
my
hands
and
said
more
foolish
things
when
the
tempest
had
abated
i
laughed
it
is
you
that
have
acquired
the
art
of
transports
in
paris
said
i
perhaps
i
have
shall
i
teach
you
you
will
have
to
learn
moderation
my
dear
judith
i
remarked
you
have
been
living
too
rapidly
of
late
and
are
looking
it
is
only
the
journey
she
replied
i
am
sure
it
is
the
unaccustomed
dissipation
judith
is
not
a
strong
woman
and
late
hours
and
eternal
gadding
about
do
not
suit
her
constitution
she
has
lost
weight
and
there
are
faint
circles
under
her
eyes
there
are
lines
too
on
her
face
which
only
show
in
hours
of
physical
strain
i
was
proceeding
to
expound
this
to
her
at
some
length
for
i
consider
it
well
for
women
to
have
some
one
to
counsel
them
frankly
in
such
matters
when
she
interrupted
me
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
there
there
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
with
yourself
your
letters
gave
me
very
little
i
am
afraid
said
i
i
am
a
poor
letter
i
read
each
ten
times
over
she
said
i
kissed
her
hand
in
acknowledgment
then
i
rose
lit
a
cigarette
and
walked
about
the
room
judith
shook
out
her
skirts
and
settled
herself
comfortably
among
the
well
what
crimes
have
you
been
committing
the
past
few
weeks
a
wandering
minstrel
was
harping
love
s
sweet
dream
outside
the
below
i
shut
the
window
hastily
nothing
so
bad
as
that
said
i
he
ought
to
be
hung
and
his
wild
harp
hung
behind
you
are
developing
nerves
said
judith
is
it
a
guilty
conscience
she
laughed
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
i
ve
been
aware
of
it
all
the
indeed
how
by
the
sixth
sense
of
woman
confound
the
sixth
sense
of
woman
i
suppose
it
has
been
developed
like
a
cat
s
whiskers
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
a
natural
scent
also
like
the
whiskers
it
is
obtrusive
and
a
matter
for
much
irritatingly
complacent
pride
judith
regarded
me
with
a
mock
magisterial
air
and
i
was
put
into
the
dock
at
once
something
has
happened
i
said
desperately
a
female
woman
has
come
and
taken
up
her
residence
at
lingfield
terrace
a
few
weeks
ago
she
ate
with
her
fingers
and
believed
the
earth
was
flat
i
found
her
in
the
victoria
embankment
gardens
beneath
the
terrace
of
the
national
liberal
club
and
now
she
lives
on
chocolate
creams
and
the
child
s
guide
to
she
is
eighteen
and
her
name
is
carlotta
there
as
my
cigarette
had
gone
out
i
threw
it
with
some
peevishness
into
the
grate
judith
s
expression
had
changed
from
mock
to
real
gravity
she
sat
bolt
upright
and
looked
at
me
somewhat
stonily
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
marcus
what
i
say
i
m
saddled
with
the
responsibility
of
a
child
of
nature
as
unsophisticated
and
perplexing
as
voltaire
s
huron
she
s
english
and
she
came
from
a
harem
in
syria
and
she
is
as
beautiful
as
the
houris
she
believes
in
and
is
unfortunately
precluded
from
joining
one
of
these
days
i
shall
be
teaching
her
her
catechism
i
have
already
washed
her
face
kindly
pity
me
as
the
innocent
victim
of
fantastic
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
pity
you
said
judith
i
felt
i
had
not
explained
carlotta
tactfully
if
there
are
ten
ways
of
doing
a
thing
i
have
noticed
that
i
invariably
select
the
one
way
that
is
wrong
i
perceived
that
somehow
or
other
the
very
contingency
i
had
feared
had
come
to
pass
i
had
prejudiced
judith
against
carlotta
i
had
aroused
the
ishmaelite
her
hand
against
every
woman
and
every
woman
s
hand
against
her
that
survives
in
all
her
sex
my
dear
judith
said
i
if
a
wicked
fairy
godmother
had
decreed
that
a
healthy
rhinoceros
should
be
my
housemate
you
would
have
extended
me
your
sympathy
but
because
fate
has
inflicted
on
me
an
equally
embarrassing
guest
in
the
shape
of
a
young
woman
my
dear
marcus
interrupted
judith
the
healthy
rhinoceros
would
know
twenty
times
as
much
about
women
as
you
this
i
consider
one
of
the
silliest
remarks
judith
has
ever
made
do
she
continued
tell
me
something
coherent
about
this
young
person
you
call
i
told
the
story
from
beginning
to
end
but
why
in
the
world
did
you
keep
it
from
me
she
asked
i
mistrusted
the
sixth
sense
of
woman
said
i
the
most
elementary
sense
of
woman
or
any
one
else
would
have
told
you
that
you
were
doing
a
very
foolish
how
would
you
have
acted
i
should
have
handed
her
over
at
once
to
the
turkish
not
if
you
had
seen
her
judith
tossed
her
head
men
are
all
alike
she
observed
on
the
contrary
said
i
that
which
characterises
men
as
a
sex
is
their
greater
variation
from
type
than
women
it
is
a
scientific
fact
you
will
find
it
stated
by
darwin
and
more
authoritatively
still
by
later
writers
the
highest
common
factor
of
a
hundred
women
is
far
greater
than
that
of
a
hundred
men
the
abnormal
is
more
frequent
in
the
male
sex
there
are
more
male
that
i
can
quite
believe
snapped
judith
then
you
agree
with
me
that
men
are
not
all
alike
i
certainly
don
t
put
any
one
of
you
before
a
pretty
face
and
a
pair
of
silly
girl
s
eyes
and
he
is
a
perfect
my
dear
judith
said
i
i
don
t
care
a
hang
for
a
pretty
face
except
do
you
really
care
about
mine
she
asked
wistfully
my
dear
said
i
dropping
on
one
knee
by
the
sofa
and
taking
her
hand
i
ve
been
longing
for
it
for
six
and
i
counted
the
weeks
on
her
fingers
this
put
her
in
a
good
humour
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
something
adorably
infantile
in
grown
up
women
shall
man
ever
understand
them
i
have
seen
babies
not
many
i
am
glad
to
say
crow
with
delight
at
having
their
toes
pulled
with
a
this
little
pig
went
to
market
and
so
forth
judith
almost
crowed
at
having
the
weeks
told
off
on
her
fingers
queer
an
hour
was
taken
up
with
the
account
of
her
doings
in
paris
she
had
met
all
the
nicest
and
naughtiest
people
she
had
been
courted
and
flattered
an
artist
in
a
slouch
hat
baggy
corduroy
breeches
floppy
tie
and
general
misfit
had
made
love
to
her
on
the
top
of
the
eiffel
tower
and
he
said
laughed
judith
ensemble
comme
on
dit
en
fly
with
me
i
remarked
that
our
state
when
we
got
to
the
champs
de
mars
would
be
an
effective
disguise
he
didn
t
understand
and
it
was
delicious
i
laughed
all
the
same
i
observed
i
can
t
see
the
fun
of
making
jokes
which
the
person
to
whom
you
make
them
doesn
t
see
the
point
why
that
s
your
own
peculiar
form
of
humour
she
retorted
i
caught
the
trick
from
perhaps
she
is
right
i
have
noticed
that
people
are
slow
in
their
appreciation
of
my
witticisms
i
must
really
be
a
very
dull
dog
if
she
were
not
fond
of
me
i
don
t
see
how
a
bright
woman
like
judith
could
tolerate
my
society
for
half
an
hour
i
don
t
think
i
contribute
to
the
world
s
humour
but
the
world
s
humour
contributes
much
to
my
own
entertainment
and
things
which
appear
amusing
to
me
do
not
appeal
when
i
point
them
out
to
the
risible
faculties
of
another
every
individual
i
suppose
like
every
civilisation
must
have
his
own
standard
of
humour
if
i
were
a
roman
instead
of
an
english
epicurean
i
should
have
died
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
a
fat
christian
martyr
scudding
round
the
arena
while
chased
by
a
hungry
lion
at
present
i
should
faint
with
horror
indeed
i
always
feel
tainted
with
savagery
and
enjoying
a
vicarious
lust
when
i
smile
at
the
tale
of
the
poor
tiger
in
dore
s
picture
that
hadn
t
got
a
christian
on
the
other
hand
it
tickles
me
immensely
to
behold
a
plethoric
commonplace
briton
roar
himself
purple
with
impassioned
platitude
at
a
political
meeting
but
i
perceive
that
all
my
neighbours
take
him
with
the
utmost
seriousness
again
your
literary
journalist
professes
to
wriggle
in
his
chair
over
the
humour
of
jane
austen
to
me
she
is
the
dullest
lady
that
ever
faithfully
photographed
the
trivial
years
ago
i
happened
to
be
crossing
putney
bridge
in
a
and
silk
hat
when
a
passing
member
of
the
proletariat
dug
his
elbows
in
his
comrade
s
ribs
and
quoting
a
tag
of
the
period
shouted
he
s
got
em
on
whereupon
both
burst
into
peals
of
robustious
but
inane
laughter
now
if
i
had
turned
to
them
and
said
he
would
be
funnier
if
i
hadn
t
and
paraphrased
however
wittily
carlyle
s
ironical
picture
of
a
nude
court
of
james
s
they
would
have
punched
my
head
under
the
confused
idea
that
i
was
trying
to
bamboozle
them
which
brings
me
to
my
point
of
departure
my
remark
to
judith
as
to
the
futility
of
jesting
to
unpercipient
ears
i
did
not
take
up
her
retort
and
what
was
the
end
of
the
romance
i
asked
he
borrowed
twenty
francs
of
me
to
pay
for
the
and
his
annee
delicacy
of
soul
compelled
him
to
blot
my
existence
forever
from
his
he
never
repaid
you
i
asked
for
a
humouristic
philosopher
cried
judith
you
are
delicious
judith
is
too
fond
of
that
word
she
uses
it
in
season
and
out
of
season
we
have
the
richest
language
that
ever
a
people
has
accreted
and
we
use
it
as
if
it
were
the
poorest
we
hoard
up
our
infinite
wealth
of
words
between
the
boards
of
dictionaries
and
in
speech
dole
out
the
worn
bronze
coinage
of
our
vocabulary
we
are
the
misers
of
philological
history
and
when
we
can
save
our
pennies
and
pass
the
counterfeit
coin
of
slang
we
are
as
happy
as
if
we
heard
a
blind
beggar
thank
us
for
putting
a
pewter
sixpence
into
his
hat
i
said
something
of
the
sort
to
judith
after
she
had
resumed
her
seat
and
i
had
opened
the
window
the
minstrel
having
wandered
to
the
next
hostelry
where
the
process
of
converting
love
s
sweet
dream
into
a
nightmare
was
still
faintly
audible
judith
looked
at
me
whimsically
as
i
stood
breathing
the
comparatively
fresh
air
and
enjoying
the
relative
silence
you
are
still
the
same
i
am
glad
to
see
conversation
with
the
young
savage
from
syria
hasn
t
altered
you
in
the
in
the
first
place
said
i
savages
do
not
grow
in
syria
and
in
the
second
how
could
she
have
altered
me
if
the
heavens
were
to
open
and
the
new
jerusalem
to
appear
this
moment
before
you
retorted
judith
with
the
relevant
irrelevance
of
her
sex
you
would
begin
an
unconcerned
disquisition
on
the
iconography
of
i
sat
on
the
sofa

and
touched
one
of
her
little
pink
ears
she
has
pretty
ears
they
were
the
first
of
things
physical
about
her
that
attracted
me
to
her
years
ago
in
the
roman
pension
they
and
the
mass
of
silken
flax
that
is
her
hair
and
her
violet
eyes
did
you
learn
that
particular
way
of
talking
in
paris
i
asked
she
had
the
effrontery
to
say
she
was
imitating
me
and
that
it
was
a
very
good
imitation
indeed
we
talked
about
the
book
i
touched
upon
the
great
problem
that
requires
solution
the
harmonising
and
justifying
of
the
contradictory
opposites
in
renaissance
character
fra
lippo
lippi
breaking
his
own
vows
and
breaking

up
with
orgies
of
sensual
depravity

his

all
the
time
making
himself
an
historic

at
the
very
heart
of
the
pazzi
conspiracy
to
murder
the

and
pope
nicholas
v
when
drunk
ordering
a
man
to
be
executed
and
being
sorry
for
it
when
sober
said
judith
it
is
wonderful
how
judith
with
her
quite
unspecialised
knowledge
of
history
can
now
and
then
put
her
finger
upon
something
vital
i
have
been
racking
my
brain
and
searching
my
library
for
the
past
two
or
three
days
for
an
illustration
of
just
that
nature
i
had
not
thought
of
it
here
is
tomaso
da
sarzana
a
quiet
retired
schoolmaster
like
myself
an
editor
of
classical
texts
a
peaceful
librarian
of
cosmo
de
medici
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
is
made
pope
a
king

to
save
the
cardinalate
from
a
possible
king

discovered
and
the
conspirators
are
hunted
over

and
put
to

a

called

slightly
inculpated
he
is
invited

when

at

stefano

the

so
the
next
morning
his
holiness
finds
to
his
surprise
and
annoyance
that
the
gentleman
s
head
has
been
cut
off
by
his
orders
it
is
an
amazing
tale
to
realise
how
amazing
it
is
one
must
picture
the
fantastic
possibility
of
it
happening
at
the
vatican
nowadays
and
the
most
astounding
thing
is
this
that
if
all
the
dead
and
gone
popes
were
alive
and
the
soul
of
the
saintly
pontiff
of

to
pass
from
him
the
one
who
could
most
undetected
occupy
his
simulacrum
would
be
this
very
thomas
of
sarzana
pardon
me
my
dear
judith
said
i
but
this
is
a
story
lying
somewhat
up
one
of
the
of
history
where
did
you
come
across
it
i
saw
it
the
other
day
in
a
french
comic
paper
replied
judith
i
really
don
t
know
which
to
admire
the
more
the
inconsequent
way
in
which
the
french
toss
about
scholarship
or
the
marvellous
power
of
assimilation
possessed
by
judith
before
we
separated
she
returned
to
the
subject
of
carlotta
am
i
to
see
this
young
creature
she
asked
that
is
just
as
you
choose
said
i
oh
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
my
dear
marcus
i
am
perfectly
indifferent
replied
judith
assuming
the
supercilious
expression
with
which
women
invariably
try
to
mask
inordinate
curiosity
then
said
i
with
a
touch
of
malice
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
make
her
i
should
be
able
to
see
through
her
tricks
and
put
you
on
your
against
what
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
it
were
vain
to
waste
breath
on
so
obtuse
a
person
you
had
better
bring
her
round
some
afternoon
she
said
have
i
acted
wisely
in
confessing
carlotta
to
judith
and
why
do
i
use
the
word
confess
far
from
having
committed
an
evil
action
i
consider
i
have
exhibited
exemplary
altruism
did
i
want
a
young
savage
from
syria
to
come
and
interfere
with
my
perfectly
ordered
life
judith
does
not
realise
this
i
had
a
presentiment
of
the
prejudice
she
would
conceive
against
the
poor
girl
and
now
it
has
been
verified
i
wish
i
had
held
my
tongue
as
judith
for
some
feminine
reason
known
only
to
herself
has
steadily
declined
to
put
her
foot
inside
my
house
she
might
very
well
have
remained
unsuspicious
of
carlotta
s
existence
and
why
not
the
fact
of
the
girl
being
my
pensioner
does
not
in
the
least
affect
the
personality
which
i
bring
to
judith
the
idea
is
absurd
why
wasn
t
i
wise
before
the
event
i
might
have
spared
myself
considerable
worry
a
letter
from
my
aunt
jessica
enclosing
a
card
for
a
fancy
dress
ball
at
the
empress
rooms
the
preposterous
lady
do
come
it
is
not
right
for
a
young
man
to
lead
the
life
of
a
recluse
of
seventy
here
we
are
in
the
height
of
the
london
season
and
i
am
sure
you
haven
t
been
into
ten
houses
when
a
hundred
of
the
very
best
are
open
to
you
i
loathe
the
term
best
the
tinsel
ineptitude
of
them
for
entertainment
i
really
would
sooner
attend
a
mothers
meeting
or
listen
to
the
serious
british
drama
have
i
read
so
and
so
s
novel
am
i
going
to
chose
s
dance
do
i
ride
in
the
park
do
i
know
young
thingummy
of
the
guards
who
is
going
to
marry
lady
betty
something
what
do
i
think
of
the
academy
as
if
one
could
have
any
sentiment
with
regard
to
the
academy
save
regret
at
such
profusion
of
fresh
paint
you
want
shaking
up
continued
my
aunt
silly
woman
if
there
is
a
thing
i
should
abhor
it
would
be
to
be
shaken
up
come
and
dine
with
us
at
and
i
ll
promise
you
a
delightful
time
and
think
how
proud
the
girls
would
be
of
showing
off
their
patiti
et
i
am
again
reminded
that
i
owe
it
to
my
position
my
title
god
ha
mercy
on
us
to
bedeck
myself
like
a
decayed
mummer
in
a
booth
and
frisk
about
in
a
pestilential
atmosphere
with
a
crowd
of
strange
and
uninteresting
young
females
is
the
correct
way
of
fulfilling
the
obligations
that
the
sovereign
laid
upon
the
successors
to
the
title
when
he
conferred
the
dignity
of
a
baronetcy
on
my
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
the
prince
regent
was
that
sovereign
and
my
ancestor
did
things
for
him
at
brighton
perhaps
after
all
there
is
a
savage
irony
of
truth
in
aunt
jessica
s
suggestion
and
a
should
i
be
indeed
what
does
she
think
i
would
go
as
a
mousquetaire
or
a
troubadour
in
blue
satin
trunks
and
cloak
white
silk
tights
and
shoes
and
a
grecian
helmet
like
snodgrass
at
leo
hunter
s
champetre
i
wish
i
could
fathom
aunt
jessica
s
reasons
for
her
attempts
at
involving
me
in
her
social
mountebankery
if
the
girls
get
no
better
than
me
heaven
help
them
only
a
fortnight
ago
i
drove
with
them
to
hurlingham
my
aunt
and
gwendolen
disappeared
in
an
unaccountable
manner
with
another
man
leaving
me
under
an
umbrella
tent
to
take
charge
of
dora
i
had
an
hour
and
a
half
of
undiluted
dora
the
dose
was
too
strong
and
it
made
my
head
ache
i
think
i
prefer
neat
carlotta
chapter
ix
july
i
lunched
at
home
and
read
drowsily
before
the
open
window
till
four
o
clock
then
the
splendour
of
the
day
invited
me
forth
whither
should
i
go
i
thought
of
judith
and
hampstead
heath
i
also
thought
of
carlotta
and
hyde
park
the
sound
of
the
lions
roaring
for
their
afternoon
tea
reached
me
through
the
still
air
and
i
put
from
me
a
strong
temptation
to
wander
alone
and
meditative
in
the
zoological
gardens
close
by
i
must
not
forget
i
reflected
that
i
am
responsible
for
carlotta
s
education
whereas
i
am
in
no
wise
responsible
for
the
animals
or
for
judith
if
judith
and
i
had
claims
one
on
the
other
the
entire
charm
of
our
relationship
would
be
broken
i
resolved
to
take
carlotta
to
the
park
in
order
to
improve
her
mind
she
would
see
how
englishwomen
comport
themselves
externally
it
would
be
a
lesson
in
decorum
i
do
not
despise
convention
indeed
i
follow
it
up
to
the
point
when
it
puts
on
the
airs
of
revealed
religion
my
neighbours
and
i
decide
on
a
certain
code
of
manners
which
will
enable
us
to
meet
without
mutual
offence
i
agree
to
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
nose
when
i
sneeze
in
his
presence
and
he
contracts
not
to
wipe
muddy
boots
on
my
sofa
i
undertake
not
to
shock
his
wife
by
parading
my
hideous
immorality
before
her
eyes
and
he
binds
himself
not
to
aggravate
my
celibacy
by
beating
her
or
kissing
her
when
i
am
paying
a
call
i
agree
by
wearing
an
arbitrarily
fixed
costume
when
i
dine
with
him
to
brand
myself
with
the
stamp
of
a
certain
class
of
society
so
that
his
guests
shall
receive
me
without
question
and
he
in
return
gives
me
a
dinner
served
with
the
minimum
amount
of
inconvenience
to
myself
that
his
circumstances
allow
many
folks
make
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
unconventionality
a
mere
cloak
for
selfish
disregard
of
the
feelings
and
tastes
of
others
bohemianism
too
often
means
piggish
sloth
or
slatternly
ineptitude
convention
is
solely
a
matter
of
manners
that
is
why
i
desire
to
instil
some
convention
into
what
for
want
of
a
more
accurate
term
i
may
allude
to
as
carlotta
s
mind
it
will
save
me
much
trouble
in
the
future
i
summoned
carlotta
carlotta
i
said
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
hyde
park
and
show
you
the
english
aristocracy
wearing
their
best
clothes
and
their
best
behaviour
you
must
do
the
my
best
clothes
cried
carlotta
her
face
lighting
up
your
very
best
make
i
smiled
she
ran
from
the
room
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
reappeared
unblushingly
and
in
the
evening
dress
that
had
caused
her
such
dismay
on
saturday
i
jumped
to
my
feet
there
is
no
denying
that
she
looked
amazingly
beautiful
she
looked
in
fact
disconcertingly
beautiful
i
found
it
hard
to
tell
her
to
take
the
dress
off
again
is
it
wrong
she
asked
nvith
a
pucker
of
her
baby
lips
yes
indeed
said
i
people
would
be
but
on
saturday
evening
she
began
i
know
my
child
i
interrupted
in
society
you
are
scarcely
respectable
unless
you
go
about
half
naked
at
night
but
to
do
so
in
the
daytime
would
be
the
grossest
indecency
i
ll
explain
some
other
i
shall
never
understand
said
carlotta
two
great
tears
stood
one
on
each
eyelid
and
fell
simultaneously
down
her
cheeks
what
on
earth
are
you
crying
for
i
asked
aghast
you
are
not
pleased
with
me
said
carlotta
with
a
choke
in
her
voice
the
two
tears
fell
like
on
to
her
bosom
and
she
stood
before
me
a
picture
of
exquisite
woe
then
i
did
a
very
foolish
thing
last
week
a
little
gold
brooch
in
a
jeweller
s
window
caught
my
fancy
i
bought
it
with
the
idea
of
presenting
it
to
carlotta
when
an
occasion
offered
as
a
reward
for
peculiar
merit
now
however
to
show
her
that
i
was
in
no
way
angry
i
abstracted
the
bauble
from
the
drawer
of
my
and
put
it
in
her
hand
you
please
me
so
much
carlotta
said
i
that
i
have
bought
this
for
before
i
had
completed
the
sentence
and
before
i
knew
what
she
was
after
her
arms
were
round
my
neck
and
she
was
hugging
me
like
a
child
i
have
never
experienced
such
an
odd
sensation
in
my
life
as
the
touch
of
carlotta
s
fresh
young
arms
upon
my
face
and
the
perfume
of
spring
violets
that
emanated
from
her
person
i
released
myself
swiftly
from
her
indecorous
demonstration
you
mustn
t
do
things
like
that
said
i
severely
in
england
young
women
are
only
allowed
to
embrace
their
carlotta
looked
at
me
with
the
knitting
of
the
forehead
but
you
are
so
good
to
me
seer
marcous
she
said
i
hope
you
ll
find
many
people
good
to
you
carlotta
i
answered
but
if
you
continue
that
method
of
expressing
your
appreciation
you
may
possibly
be
i
had
recovered
from
the
momentary
shock
to
my
senses
and
i
laughed
she
fluttered
a
sidelong
glance
at
me
and
a
smile
as
inscrutable
as
the
monna
lisa
s
hovered
over
her
lips
what
would
they
do
if
they
did
not
understand
they
would
take
you
i
replied
fixing
her
sternly
with
my
gaze
they
would
take
you
for
an
unconscionable
laughed
carlotta
suddenly
and
she
ran
from
the
room
in
a
moment
she
was
back
again
she
came
up
to
me
demurely
and
plucked
my
sleeve
come
and
show
me
what
i
must
put
on
so
as
to
please
i
rang
the
bell
for
antoinette
to
whom
i
gave
the
necessary
instructions
her
next
request
would
be
that
i
should
act
the
part
of
lady
i
must
maintain
my
dignity
with
carlotta
the
lovely
afternoon
had
attracted
many
people
to
the
park
and
the
lawns
were
thronged
we
found
a
couple
of
chairs
at
the
edge
of
one
of
the
and
watched
the
elegant
assembly
carlotta
vastly
entertained
asked
innumerable
questions
how
could
i
tell
whether
a
lady
was
married
or
unmarried
did
they
all
wear
stays
why
did
every
one
look
so
happy
did
i
think
that
old
man
was
the
young
girl
s
husband
what
were
they
all
talking
about
wouldn
t
i
take
her
for
a
drive
in
one
of
those
beautiful
carriages
why
hadn
t
i
a
carriage
then
suddenly
as
if
inspired
after
a
few
minutes
silent
reflection
seer
marcous
is
this
the
marriage
market
the
what
i
gasped
the
marriage
market
i
read
it
in
a
book
yesterday
miss
griggs
gave
it
me
to
read
aloud
tack
thack
thackeray
they
come
here
to
sell
the
young
girls
to
men
who
want
she
edged
away
from
me
with
a
little
movement
of
alarm
that
is
not
why
you
have
brought
me
here
to
sell
me
how
much
do
you
think
you
would
be
worth
i
asked
sarcastically
she
opened
out
her
hands
palms
upward
throwing
down
her
parasol
as
she
did
so
upon
her
neighbour
s
little
belgian
griffon
who
yelped
ch
lots
she
said
in
her
frank
way
i
am
very
i
picked
up
the
parasol
bowed
apologetically
to
the
owner
of
the
stricken
animal
and
addressed
carlotta
listen
my
good
child
you
are
passably
but
you
are
by
no
means
very
beautiful
if
i
tried
to
sell
you
here
you
might
possibly
fetch
half
a
crown
two
shillings
and
sixpence
asked
the
literal
carlotta
yes
just
that
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
would
buy
you
this
is
not
the
marriage
market
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
marriage
market
english
mothers
and
fathers
do
not
sell
their
daughters
for
money
such
a
thing
is
monstrous
and
then
it
was
all
lies
i
read
in
the
book
all
lies
said
i
hope
the
genial
shade
of
the
great
satirist
has
forgiven
me
why
do
they
put
lies
in
books
to
accentuate
the
truth
so
that
it
shall
prevail
i
answered
this
was
too
hard
a
nut
for
carlotta
to
crack
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
reverted
ruefully
to
the
intelligible
i
thought
i
was
beautiful
she
said
who
told
you
so
pasquale
has
no
sense
said
i
there
are
men
to
whom
all
women
who
are
not
seventy
and
toothless
and
rheumy
at
the
eyes
are
beautiful

woman

hundred

very
pretty
and
he
makes
me
laugh
and
i
like
him
said
carlotta
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
said
i
the
griffon
who
had
been
sniffing
at
carlotta
s
skirts
suddenly
leaped
into
her
lap
with
a
swift
movement
of
her
hand
she
swept
the
poor
little
creature
as
if
it
had
been
a
noxious
insect
yards
away
carlotta
i
cried
angrily
springing
to
my
feet
the
ladies
who
owned
the
beast
rushed
to
their
whining
pet
and
looked
astonished
daggers
at
carlotta
when
they
picked
it
up
it
sat
dangling
a
piteous
paw
carlotta
rose
merely
scared
at
my
anger
i
raised
my
hat
i
am
more
than
sorry
i
can
t
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
i
hope
the
little
dog
is
not
hurt
my
ward
for
whom
i
offer
a
thousand
apologies
is
a
mohammedan
to
whom
all
dogs
are
unclean
please
attribute
the
accident
to
religious
the
younger
of
the
two
who
had
been
examining
the
paw
looked
up
with
a
smile
your
ward
is
forgiven
punch
oughtn
t
to
jump
on
strange
ladies
laps
whether
they
are
mohammedans
or
not
oh
he
is
more
frightened
than
hurt
and
i
she
added
with
a
twinkling
eye
am
more
hurt
than
frightened
because
sir
marcus
ordeyne
doesn
t
recognise
so
carlotta
had
nearly
killed
the
dog
of
an
unrecalled
acquaintance
i
do
indeed
recognise
you
now
said
i
mendaciously
i
seem
to
have
been
lying
through
thick
and
thin
but
in
the
confusion
of
the
disaster
you
sat
next
me
at
lunch
one
day
last
winter
at
ordeyne
s
interrupted
the
lady
and
you
talked
to
me
of
transcendental
i
remembered
the
crime
said
i
has
lain
heavily
on
my
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
she
laughed
dismissing
me
with
a
bow
i
raised
my
hat
and
joined
carlotta
it
was
a
miss
gascoigne
a
flirtatious
intimate
of
aunt
jessica
s
house
to
this
irresponsible
young
woman
i
had
openly
avowed
that
i
was
the
guardian
of
a
beautiful
mohammedan
whose
religious
instinct
compelled
her
to
destroy
little
dogs
i
shall
hear
of
this
from
my
aunt
jessica
i
walked
stonily
away
with
carlotta
you
are
cross
with
me
she
whimpered
yes
i
am
you
might
have
killed
the
poor
little
beast
it
was
very
wicked
and
cruel
of
carlotta
burst
out
crying
in
the
midst
of
the
promenade
the
tears
did
not
romantically
come
into
her
eyes
as
they
had
done
an
hour
before
but
she
wept
copiously
after
the
unrestrained
manner
of
children
and
used
her
from
their
seats
women
put
up
their
lorgnons
to
look
at
her
turned
round
and
stared
the
whole
of
the
gaily
dressed
throng
seemed
to
be
one
amused
gaze
in
a
moment
or
two
i
became
conscious
that
reprehensory
glances
were
being
directed
towards
myself
calling
me
as
plain
as
eyes
could
call
an
brute
for
making
the
poor
young
creature
who
was
at
my
mercy
thus
break
down
in
public
it
was
a
charming
situation
for
an
philosopher
we
walked
stolidly
on
i
glaring
in
front
of
me
and
carlotta
weeping
the
malice
of
things
arranged
that
ne
neighbouring
chair
should
be
vacant
and
that
the
path
should
be
unusually
crowded
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
a
young
fellow
say
to
a
girl
he
that
s
ordeyne
came
into
the
baronetcy
mad
as
a
dingo
i
was
giving
myself
a
fine
advertisement
for
heaven
s
sake
stop
crying
i
said
then
a
memory
of
childhood
flashed
its
inspiration
upon
me
if
you
don
t
i
added
grimly
i
ll
take
you
out
and
give
you
to
a
the
effect
was
magical
she
turned
on
me
a
scared
look
gasped
pulled
down
her
veil
which
she
had
raised
so
as
to
dab
her
eyes
with
her
and
incontinently
checked
the
fountain
of
her
tears
a
policeman
yes
said
i
a
great
big
ugly
blue
policeman
who
shuts
up
people
who
misbehave
themselves
in
prison
and
takes
off
their
clothes
and
shaves
their
heads
and
feeds
them
on
bread
and
i
won
t
cry
any
more
she
said
swallowing
a
sob
is
it
also
wicked
to
cry
any
of
these
ladies
here
would
sooner
be
burned
alive
with
dyspepsia
or
cut
in
two
with
i
replied
severely
let
us
sit
we
stepped
over
the
low
iron
rail
and
passing
through
the
first
two
rows
of
people
found
seats
behind
where
the
crowd
was
thinner
is
seer
marcous
still
angry
with
me
asked
carlotta
and
the
simple
plaintiveness
of
her
voice
would
have
melted
the
bust
of
nero
i
lectured
her
on
cruelty
to
animals
that
one
had
duties
of
kindness
towards
the
lower
creation
appealed
to
her
as
a
totally
new
idea
supposing
the
dog
had
broken
all
its
legs
and
ribs
would
she
not
have
been
sorry
she
answered
frankly
in
the
negative
it
was
a
nasty
little
dog
if
she
had
hurt
it
badly
so
much
the
better
what
did
it
matter
if
a
dog
was
hurt
she
was
sorry
now
she
had
hurled
it
into
space
because
it
belonged
to
my
friends
and
that
had
made
me
cross
with
her
of
course
i
was
shocked
at
the
thoughtless
cruelty
of
the
action
but
my
anger
had
also
its
roots
in
dismay
at
the
public
scandal
it
might
have
caused
and
in
the
discovery
that
i
was
known
to
the
victim
s
owner
it
is
the
sad
fate
of
the
instructors
of
youth
that
they
must
hypocritically
credit
themselves
with
only
the
sublimest
of
motives
i
spoke
to
carlotta
like
the
good
father
in
the
swiss
family
i
gave
vent
to
such
noble
sentiments
that
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
glowed
with
pride
in
my
borrowed
plumes
of
virtue
i
would
have
taken
a
slug
to
my
bosom
and
addressed
a
rattlesnake
as
uncle
toby
did
the
fly
i
wonder
whether
it
is
not
through
some
such
process
as
this
that
parsons
manage
to
keep
themselves
good
the
soothing
warmth
of
conscious
merit
restored
me
to
good
temper
and
when
carlotta
slid
her
hand
into
mine
and
asked
me
if
i
had
forgiven
her
i
magnanimously
assured
her
that
all
the
past
was
forgotten
only
said
i
you
will
have
to
get
out
of
this
habit
of
tears
a
wise
man
called
burton
says
in
his
anatomy
of
melancholy
a
beautiful
book
which
i
ll
give
you
to
read
when
you
are
sixty
as
much
count
may
be
taken
of
a
woman
weeping
as
a
goose
going
he
was
a
nasty
old
man
said
carlotta
women
cry
because
they
feel
very
unhappy
men
are
never
unhappy
and
that
is
the
reason
that
men
don
t
cry
my
mamma
used
to
cry
all
the
time
at
alexandretta
but
hamdi
she
broke
into
an
adorable
trill
of
a
chuckle
you
would
as
soon
see
a
goose
going
with
boots
and
stockings
like
the
puss
in
the
shoes
the
fairy
tale
as
hamdi
crying
half
an
hour
later
as
we
were
driving
homewards
she
broke
a
rather
long
silence
which
she
had
evidently
been
employing
in
meditation
seer
yes
she
has
a
child
s
engaging
way
of
rubbing
herself
up
against
one
when
she
wants
to
be
particularly
ingratiating
it
was
so
nice
to
dine
with
you
on
really
oh
when
are
you
going
to
let
me
dine
with
you
again
to
show
me
you
have
forgiven
me
a
hansom
cab
offers
peculiar
facilities
for
the
aforesaid
process
of
ingratiation
you
shall
dine
with
me
this
evening
said
i
and
carlotta
cooed
with
pleasure
i
perceive
that
she
is
gradually
growing
westernised
july
in
obedience
to
a
peremptory
note
from
judith
i
took
carlotta
this
afternoon
to
tottenham
mansions
i
shook
hands
with
my
hostess
turned
round
and
said
this
my
dear
judith
is
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
you
said
judith
so
am
i
replied
carlotta
not
to
be
outdone
in
politeness
she
sat
bolt
upright
most
correctly
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
responded
monosyllabically
to
judith
s
questions
her
demeanour
could
not
have
been
more
impeccable
had
she
been
trained
in
a
french
convent
just
before
we
arrived
she
had
been
laughing
immoderately
because
i
had
ordered
her
to
spit
out
a
mass
of
horrible
sweetmeat
which
she
had
found
it
impossible
to
masticate
and
she
had
challenged
me
to
extract
it
with
my
fingers
but
now
compared
with
her
saint
nitouche
was
a
maenad
i
was
entertained
by
judith
s
fruitless
efforts
to
get
behind
this
wall
of
reserve
carlotta
said
oh
or
to
everything
it
was
not
a
momentous
conversation
as
it
was
carlotta
in
whom
judith
was
particularly
interested
i
effaced
myself
at
last
after
a
lull
in
the
spasmodic
talk
carlotta
said
very
politely
mrs
mainwaring
has
a
beautiful
it
s
only
a
tiny
flat
would
you
like
to
look
over
it
asked
judith
eagerly
flashing
me
a
glance
that
plainly
said
now
that
i
shall
have
her
to
myself
you
may
trust
me
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
i
would
like
it
very
much
said
carlotta
rising
i
held
the
door
open
for
them
to
pass
out
and
lit
a
cigarette
when
they
returned
ten
minutes
afterwards
carlotta
was
smiling
and
evidently
very
well
pleased
with
herself
but
judith
had
a
red
spot
on
each
of
her
cheeks
the
sight
of
her
smote
me
with
an
odd
new
feeling
of
pity
i
can
not
dismiss
the
vision
from
my
mind
all
the
evening
i
have
seen
the
two
women
standing
side
by
side
a
piteous
parable
the
light
from
the
window
shone
full
upon
them
and
the
dark
curtain
of
the
door
was
an
effective
background
the
one
flaunted
the
sweet
insolence
of
youth
health
colour
beauty
of
the
bud
just
burst
into
full
flower
the
other
wore
the
stamp
of
care
of
the
much
knowledge
wherein
is
much
sorrow
and
in
her
eyes
dwelled
the
ghosts
of
dead
years
she
herself
looked
like
a
in
white
pique
which
of
itself
drew
the
colour
from
her
white
face
and
pale
lips
and
mass
of
faint
hair
the
pallor
of
all
which
was
accentuated
by
the
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
and
her
violet
eyes
i
saw
that
something
had
occurred
to
vex
her
before
we
go
i
said
i
should
like
a
word
with
you
carlotta
will
not
we
went
into
the
i
took
her
hand
which
was
cold
in
spite
of
the
july
warmth
well
my
dear
said
i
what
do
you
think
of
my
young
savage
from
asia
minor
judith
laughed
i
am
sure
not
naturally
is
that
all
you
wanted
to
say
to
me
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
tidied
her
hair
in
the
mirror
of
the
overmantel
i
think
she
is
a
most
uninteresting
young
woman
i
am
disappointed
i
had
anticipated
something
original
i
had
looked
forward
to
some
amusement
but
really
my
dear
marcus
she
is
a
weepingly
she
certainly
can
weep
said
i
oh
can
she
said
judith
as
if
the
announcement
threw
some
light
on
carlotta
s
character
and
when
she
cries
i
suppose
you
like
a
man
give
in
and
let
her
have
her
own
way
and
judith
laughed
again
my
dear
judith
said
i
you
have
no
idea
of
the
wholesome
discipline
at
lingfield
suddenly
with
one
of
her
disconcerting
changes
of
front
she
turned
and
caught
me
by
the
marcus
dear
i
have
been
so
lonely
this
week
when
are
you
coming
to
see
me
we
ll
have
a
whole
day
out
on
sunday
said
i
as
i
walked
down
the
stairs
with
carlotta
i
reflected
that
judith
had
not
accounted
for
the
red
spots
i
like
her
said
carlotta
she
is
a
nice
old
old
lady
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
was
indeed
startled
she
is
a
young
pouf
cried
carlotta
she
is
she
is
no
such
thing
i
cried
she
is
years
younger
than
she
would
not
tell
you
asked
her
age
oh
said
carlotta
i
was
very
polite
i
first
asked
if
she
was
married
she
said
yes
then
i
asked
how
her
husband
was
she
said
she
didn
t
know
that
was
funny
why
does
she
not
know
seer
marcous
never
mind
said
i
go
on
telling
me
how
polite
you
i
asked
how
many
children
she
had
she
said
she
had
none
i
said
it
was
a
pity
and
then
i
said
i
am
eighteen
years
old
and
i
want
to
marry
quite
soon
and
have
children
how
old
are
you
and
she
would
not
tell
me
i
said
you
must
be
the
same
age
as
my
mamma
if
she
were
i
said
other
things
about
her
husband
which
i
forget
oh
i
was
very
she
smiled
up
at
me
in
quest
of
approbation
i
checked
a
horrified
rebuke
when
i
reflected
that
according
to
the
etiquette
of
the
harem
she
had
been
very
but
my
poor
judith
every
artless
question
had
been
a
knife
thrust
in
a
sensitive
spot
her
husband
the
handsome
blackguard
who
had
lured
her
into
the
divorce
court
married
her
and
after
two
unhappy
years
had
left
her
broken
children
they
would
have
kept
her
life
sweet
and
did
i
not
know
how
she
had
yearned
for
them
her
age
it
is
only
the
very
happily
married
woman
who
snaps
her
fingers
at
the
approach
of
forty
and
even
she
does
so
with
a
disquieting
sense
of
bravado
and
the
sweet
insolence
of
youth
says
i
am
eighteen
how
old
are
you
my
poor
judith
once
more
on
our
walk
home
i
discoursed
to
carlotta
on
the
differences
between
east
and
west
seer
marcous
said
carlotta
this
evening
at
dinner
i
have
decided
now
that
she
shall
dine
regularly
with
me
it
is
undoubtedly
agreeable
to
see
her
pretty
face
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
listen
to
her
irresponsible
chatter
chatter
which
i
keep
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
when
stenson
is
present
so
as
to
save
his
susceptibilities
by
the
simple
device
agreed
upon
between
us
to
her
great
delight
of
scratching
the
side
of
my
somewhat
prominent
nose
seer
marcous
why
does
mainwaring
keep
your
picture
in
her
bedroom
i
am
glad
stenson
happened
to
be
out
of
the
room
his
absence
saved
the
flaying
of
my
nasal
organ
i
explained
that
it
was
the
custom
in
england
for
ladies
to
collect
the
photographs
of
their
men
friends
and
use
them
misguidedly
for
purposes
of
decoration
but
this
said
carlotta
opening
out
her
arms
in
an
exaggerated
way
is
such
a
big
ah
that
i
answered
is
because
i
am
very
carlotta
shrieked
with
laughter
the
exquisite
comicality
of
the
jest
occasioned
bubbling
comments
of
mirth
during
the
rest
of
the
meal
and
her
original
indiscreet
question
was
happily
forgotten
chapter
x
july
judith
and
i
have
had
our
day
in
the
country
we
know
a
wayside
station
on
a
certain
line
of
railway
about
an
hour
and
a
half
from
town
where
we
can
alight
find
eggs
and
bacon
at
the
village
inn
and
hayricks
in
a
solitary
meadow
and
where
we
can
chew
the
cud
of
these
delights
with
the
cattle
in
pastures
judith
has
a
passion
for
eggs
and
bacon
and
hayricks
my
own
rapture
in
their
presence
is
tempered
by
the
philosophic
calm
of
my
disposition
she
wore
a
cotton
dress
of
a
blue
which
suits
her
pale
colouring
she
looked
quite
pretty
when
i
told
her
so
she
blushed
like
a
girl
i
was
glad
to
see
her
in
gay
humour
again
of
late
months
she
has
been
subject
to
moodiness
emotional
variability
which
has
somewhat
ruffled
the
smooth
surface
of
our
companionship
but
there
has
been
no
trace
of
she
has
shown
herself
the
pleasant
witty
judith
she
knows
i
like
her
to
be
with
a
touch
of
coquetry
thrown
in
on
her
own
account
she
even
spoke
amiably
of
carlotta
i
have
not
had
so
thoroughly
enjoyable
a
day
with
judith
for
a
long
time
i
don
t
think
she
set
herself
deliberately
to
please
me
that
i
should
resent
i
know
that
women
in
order
to
please
an
unsuspecting
male
will
walk
weary
miles
by
his
side
with
blisters
on
their
feet
and
a
beatific
smile
on
their
faces
but
judith
has
far
too
much
commonsense
another
pleasing
feature
of
the
day
s
jaunt
has
been
the
absence
of
the
appeal
to
sentimentality
which
judith
of
late
especially
since
her
return
from
paris
has
been
overfond
of
making
this
idle
habit
of
mind
for
such
it
is
in
reality
has
been
arrested
by
an
intellectual
interest
one
of
her
great
friends
is
willoughby
the
economic
statistician
who
in
his
humorous
moments
writes
articles
for
popular
magazines
illustrated
by
scale
diagrams
he
will
draw
for
instance
a
series
of
men
representing
the
nations
of
the
world
and
varying
in
bulk
and
stature
according
to
the
respective
populations
and
over
against
these
he
will
set
a
series
of
pigs
whose
sizes
are
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
pork
per
head
eaten
by
the
different
nationalities
to
these
queer
minds
that
live
on
facts
i
myself
could
as
easily
thrive
on
a
diet
of
this
sort
of
pictorial
information
is
peculiarly
fascinating
but
judith
who
like
most
women
has
a
freakish
mental
as
well
as
physical
digestion
delights
in
knowing
how
many
hogs
a
cabinet
minister
will
eat
during
a
lifetime
and
how
much
of
the
earth
s
surface
could
be
scoured
by
the
world
s
yearly
output
of
i
don
t
blame
her
for
it
any
more
than
i
blame
her
for
a
love
of
radishes
which
make
me
ill
it
is
not
as
if
she
had
no
wholesome
tastes
on
the
contrary
i
commend
her
now
willoughby
it
seems
has
found
the
public
appetite
so
great
for
these
boluses
of
knowledge
unpleasant
drugs
as
it
were
put
up
into
gelatine
capsules
that
he
needs
assistance
he
has
asked
judith
to
devil
for
him
and
i
have
persuaded
her
to
accept
his
offer
it
will
be
an
excellent
thing
for
the
dear
woman
it
will
be
an
absorbing
occupation
it
will
divert
the
current
of
her
thoughts
from
the
sentimentality
that
i
deprecate
and
provided
she
does
not
serve
up
facts
to
me
at
dinner
she
will
be
the
pleasanter
companion
the
only
return
to
it
was
when
i
kissed
her
at
parting
that
is
the
first
marcus
for
twelve
hours
she
said
very
sweetly
it
is
true
but
still
reproachfully
but
sacred
name
of
a
little
good
man
as
the
depraved
french
people
say
what
is
the
use
of
this
continuous
osculation
between
rational
beings
of
opposite
sexes
who
set
out
to
enjoy
themselves
if
only
paul
in
the
famous
passage
when
he
says
there
is
a
time
for
this
and
a
time
for
that
had
mentioned
kissing
he
would
have
done
a
great
deal
of
practical
good
july
for
the
first
time
since
i
came
into
the
family
estates
such
as
they
are
i
feel
the
paralysis
of
aspiration
occasioned
by
poverty
if
i
were
very
rich
i
would
buy
the
two
next
houses
pull
them
down
and
erect
on
the
site
a
tower
forty
foot
high
at
the
very
top
would
be
one
comfortable
room
to
be
reached
by
a
lift
and
in
this
room
i
could
have
my
being
while
it
listed
me
and
be
secure
from
all
kinds
of
incursions
and
interruptions
antoinette
s
cat
could
not
scratch
for
admittance
antoinette
herself
could
not
enter
under
pretext
of
domestic
economics
and
lure
me
into
profitless
gossip
and
i
could
defy
carlotta
who
is
growing
to
be
as
pervasive
as
the
smell
of
pickles
over
crosse
blackwell
s
factory
she
comes
in
without
knocking
looks
at
sprawls
about
doing
nothing
smokes
my
best
cigarettes
hums
tunes
which
she
has
picked
up
from
bends
over
me
to
see
what
i
am
writing
munching
her
eternal
sweetmeats
in
my
ear
and
laughs
at
me
when
i
tell
her
she
has
irremediably
broken
the
thread
of
my
ideas
of
course
i
might
be
brutal
and
turn
her
out
but
somehow
i
forget
to
do
so
until
i
realise
too
late
the
havoc
she
has
made
with
my
work
i
did
however
think
when
miss
griggs
mounted
guard
over
carlotta
and
antoinette
and
her
cat
were
busied
with
luncheon
that
my
solitude
was
unimperilled
i
see
now
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
the
tower
and
i
can
not
build
the
tower
so
i
am
to
be
henceforward
at
the
mercy
of
anything
feline
or
feminine
that
cares
to
swish
its
tail
or
its
skirts
about
my
i
was
arranging
my
notes
i
had
an
illuminating
inspiration
concerning
the
life
of
francois
villon
and
the
contemporary
court
of
cosmo
de
medici
i
was
preparing
to
fix
it
in
writing
when
the
door
opened
and
stenson
announced
mrs
ordeyne
and
miss
my
aunt
jessica
and
dora
came
in
and
my
inspiration
went
out
it
hasn
t
come
back
yet
my
aunt
s
apologies
and
dora
s
draperies
filled
the
room
i
must
forgive
the
invasion
they
knew
they
were
disturbing
my
work
they
hoped
i
didn
t
mind
i
wanted
mamma
to
write
but
she
would
come
said
dora
in
her
hearty
voice
i
murmured
polite
mendacities
and
offered
chairs
dora
preferred
to
stand
and
gaze
about
her
with
feminine
curiosity
women
always
seem
to
sniff
for
bluebeardism
in
a
bachelor
s
apartment
why
what
two
beautiful
rooms
you
have
and
the
books
there
isn
t
an
inch
of
she
went
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
round
the
shelves
while
my
aunt
explained
the
object
of
their
visit
somebody
i
forget
who
had
lent
them
a
yacht
they
were
making
up
a
party
for
a
summer
cruise
in
norwegian
fiords
the
thingummies
and
the
so
and
so
s
and
lord
this
and
miss
that
had
promised
to
come
but
they
were
sadly
in
need
of
a
man
to
play
host
i
was
to
fancy
three
lone
women
at
the
mercy
of
the
skipper
i
did
and
i
didn
t
envy
the
skipper
what
more
natural
gushed
my
aunt
than
that
they
should
turn
to
me
the
head
of
the
house
in
their
difficulty
i
am
afraid
my
dear
aunt
said
i
that
my
acquaintance
with
hosts
is
nil
i
can
t
suggest
any
but
who
asked
you
to
suggest
any
one
she
laughed
it
is
you
yourself
that
we
want
to
persuade
to
have
pity
on
i
have
much
pity
said
i
for
if
it
s
rough
you
ll
all
be
horribly
dora
ran
across
the
room
from
the
she
was
inspecting
i
would
like
to
shake
him
he
is
only
pretending
he
doesn
t
understand
i
don
t
know
what
we
shall
do
if
you
won
t
come
with
you
can
t
refuse
marcus
it
will
be
an
ideal
trip
and
such
a
comfortable
yacht
and
the
deep
blue
fiords
and
we
ve
got
a
french
chef
you
will
be
doing
us
such
a
come
say
yes
said
dora
i
wish
she
were
not
such
a
bouncing
juno
of
a
girl
large
athletic
women
with
hearty
voices
are
difficult
for
one
to
deal
with
i
am
a
match
for
my
aunt
whom
i
can
obfuscate
with
words
but
dora
doesn
t
understand
my
satire
she
gives
a
great
healthy
laugh
and
says
oh
rot
which
scatters
my
intellectual
armoury
it
is
exceedingly
kind
of
you
to
think
of
me
i
said
to
my
aunt
and
the
proposal
is
tempting
the
prospect
is
indeed
fascinating
but
but
what
i
have
so
many
engagements
i
answered
feebly
my
aunt
jessica
rose
smiling
indulgently
upon
me
as
if
i
were
a
spoilt
little
boy
and
took
me
on
to
the
balcony
while
dora
demurely
retired
to
the
bookshelves
in
the
farther
room
can
t
you
manage
to
throw
them
aside
poor
dora
will
be
i
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
at
dora
s
broad
back
and
sturdy
hips
inconsolable
i
can
t
make
out
what
the
good
lady
is
driving
at
if
she
were
a
vulgar
woman
trying
to
squeeze
her
way
into
society
and
needed
the
lubricant
of
the
family
baronetcy
i
could
understand
her
eagerness
to
parade
me
as
her
appanage
but
titles
in
her
are
as
common
as
and
the
inconsolability
of
dora
if
i
did
come
she
would
be
bored
to
death
said
i
she
is
willing
to
risk
but
why
should
she
seek
martyrdom
there
is
another
reason
said
my
aunt
ignoring
my
pertinent
question
but
glancing
at
me
reassuringly
there
is
another
reason
why
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
come
on
this
cruise
with
she
sank
her
voice
you
met
miss
gascoigne
in
the
park
last
week
a
very
charming
and
kind
young
lady
said
i
i
am
afraid
you
have
been
a
little
indiscreet
people
have
been
then
theirs
not
mine
is
the
but
my
dear
marcus
when
you
spring
a
young
person
whom
you
introduce
as
your
mohammedan
ward
upon
london
society
and
she
makes
a
scene
in
public
why
what
else
have
people
got
to
talk
about
they
might
fall
back
upon
the
doctrine
of
predestination
or
the
price
of
fish
i
replied
urbanely
but
i
assure
you
marcus
that
there
is
a
hint
of
scandal
abroad
it
is
actually
said
that
she
is
living
people
will
say
anything
true
or
untrue
said
i
my
aunt
sighfully
acquiesced
and
for
a
while
we
discussed
the
depravity
of
human
nature
i
have
been
thinking
she
said
at
last
that
if
you
brought
your
ward
to
see
us
and
she
could
accompany
us
on
this
cruise
to
norway
the
scandal
would
be
scotched
she
glanced
at
me
very
keenly
and
beneath
her
indulgent
smile
i
saw
the
hardness
of
the
old
campaigner
it
was
a
clever
trap
she
had
prepared
for
me
i
took
her
hand
and
in
my
noblest
manner
like
the
exiled
vicomte
in
costume
drama
bent
over
it
and
kissed
her
i
thank
you
my
dear
aunt
for
your
generous
faith
in
my
integrity
i
said
and
i
assure
you
your
confidence
is
well
a
loud
gay
laugh
from
the
other
room
interrupted
me
are
you
two
rehearsing
private
theatricals
cried
dora
as
i
was
attired
in
a
remarkably
old
college
blazer
and
a
pair
of
yellow
moorish
slippers
bought
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
tangier
and
as
my
hair
was
straight
on
end
owing
to
a
habit
of
passing
my
fingers
through
it
while
i
work
my
attitude
perhaps
did
not
strike
a
spectator
as
being
so
noble
as
i
had
imagined
i
took
advantage
of
the
however
to
bring
my
aunt
from
the
balcony
to
the
centre
of
the
room
where
dora
joined
us
well
has
mother
prevailed
my
dear
dora
said
i
politely
how
can
you
imagine
it
could
possibly
be
a
question
of
persuasion
that
might
be
taken
two
ways
said
dora
like
palmerston
s
dear
sir
i
ll
lose
no
time
in
reading
your
dora
is
a
minx
i
fear
said
i
that
my
pedantic
historical
sense
must
venture
to
correct
you
it
was
lord
well
he
got
it
from
palmerston
insisted
dora
you
children
must
not
quarrel
interposed
my
aunt
in
the
fond
maternal
tone
which
i
find
peculiarly
unpleasant
marcus
will
see
how
his
engagements
stand
and
let
us
know
in
a
day
or
when
do
you
propose
to
start
i
asked
quite
soon
on
the
i
will
let
you
know
finally
in
good
time
said
i
as
i
accompanied
them
downstairs
i
heard
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
open
and
turning
i
saw
carlotta
s
pretty
head
thrust
past
the
jamb
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
visitors
i
motioned
her
back
sharply
and
my
aunt
and
dora
made
an
unsuspecting
exit
the
noise
of
their
departing
chariot
wheels
was
music
to
my
ears
carlotta
came
rushing
out
of
her
followed
by
miss
griggs
protesting
who
those
fine
ladies
she
cried
with
her
hands
on
my
sleeve
who
those
ladies
i
corrected
who
those
ladies
carlotta
repeated
like
a
demure
parrot
they
are
friends
of
then
came
the
eternal
question
is
she
married
the
young
one
miss
griggs
said
i
kindly
instil
into
carlotta
s
mind
the
fact
that
no
young
english
woman
ever
thinks
about
marriage
until
she
is
actually
engaged
and
then
her
thoughts
do
not
go
beyond
the
but
is
she
persisted
carlotta
i
wish
to
heaven
she
was
i
laughed
imprudently
for
then
she
would
not
come
and
spoil
my
morning
s
oh
she
wants
to
marry
you
said
carlotta
miss
griggs
said
i
carlotta
will
resume
her
studies
and
i
went
upstairs
sighing
for
the
beautiful
tower
with
a
lift
outside
july
pasquale
came
in
about
nine
o
clock
and
found
us
playing
cards
he
is
a
bird
of
passage
with
no
fixed
abode
some
weeks
ago
he
gave
up
his
chambers
in
james
s
and
went
to
live
with
an
actor
friend
a
who
has
a
house
in
the
john
s
wood
road
close
by
why
pasquale
who
loves
the
palpitating
centres
of
existence
should
choose
to
rusticate
in
this
district
i
can
not
imagine
he
says
he
can
think
better
in
john
s
wood
pasquale
think
as
well
might
a
salmon
declare
it
could
sing
better
in
a
pond
the
consequence
of
his
propinquity
however
has
been
that
he
has
dropped
in
several
times
lately
on
his
way
home
but
generally
at
a
later
hour
oh
please
don
t
move
and
spoil
the
picture
he
cried
oh
you
idyllic
pair
and
what
are
you
playing
cribbage
if
i
had
been
challenged
to
guess
the
game
you
would
have
selected
for
your
entertainment
i
should
have
sworn
to
cribbage
an
excellent
game
said
i
indeed
it
is
the
only
game
that
i
remember
i
dislike
cards
they
bore
me
to
death
so
dus
chess
people
love
to
call
them
intellectual
pastimes
but
surely
if
a
man
wants
exercise
for
his
intellect
there
are
enough
problems
in
this
complicated
universe
for
him
to
worry
his
brains
over
with
more
profit
to
himself
and
the
world
and
as
for
the
pastime
i
consider
that
when
two
or
more
intelligent
people
sit
down
to
play
cards
they
are
insulting
one
another
s
powers
of
conversation
these
remarks
do
not
apply
to
my
game
with
carlotta
who
is
a
child
and
has
to
be
amused
she
has
picked
up
cribbage
with
remarkable
quickness
and
although
this
is
only
the
third
evening
we
have
played
she
was
getting
the
better
of
me
when
pasquale
appeared
i
repeated
my
statement
cribbage
certainly
was
an
excellent
game
pasquale
laughed
of
course
it
is
a
venerable
pastime
darby
and
joan
have
played
it
of
evenings
for
the
last
thousand
years
please
go
but
carlotta
threw
her
cards
on
the
table
and
herself
on
the
sofa
and
said
she
would
prefer
to
hear
pasquale
talk
he
says
such
funny
then
she
jumped
from
the
sofa
and
handed
him
the
box
of
chocolates
that
is
never
far
from
her
side
how
lithe
her
movements
are
pasquale
says
you
were
his
schoolmaster
and
used
to
beat
him
with
a
big
stick
she
remarked
turning
her
head
toward
me
while
pasquale
helped
himself
to
a
sweet
he
was
clumsy
in
his
selection
and
the
box
slipped
from
carlotta
s
hand
and
the
contents
rolled
upon
the
floor
they
both
went
on
hands
and
knees
to
pick
them
up
and
there
was
much
laughing
and
whispering
it
is
curious
that
i
can
not
recall
pasquale
having
alluded
in
carlotta
s
presence
to
our
early
days
it
was
on
my
tongue
to
ask
when
he
committed
the
mendacity
for
in
that
school
not
only
did
the
assistant
masters
not
have
the
power
of
the
cane
but
pasquale
being
in
the
sixth
form
at
the
time
i
joined
was
exempt
from
corporal
punishment
when
they
both
rose
flushed
from
their
grovelling
beneath
the
table
and
some
merry
remark
from
pasquale
put
the
question
out
of
my
head
all
this
is
unimportant
the
main
result
of
pasquale
s
visit
this
evening
is
a
discovery
now
is
it
after
all
a
discovery
or
only
the
intellect
s
sinister
attribution
of
motives
a
baby
in
long
clothes
would
have
seen
through
it
said
pasquale
lord
bless
you
if
i
were
in
your
position
i
would
go
on
board
that
yacht
i
d
make
violent
love
to
every
female
there
like
the
gentleman
in
wycherley
s
comedy
i
d
fill
a
salmon
with
samples
of
their
hair
i
d
make
them
hate
one
another
like
poison
and
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
i
d
announce
my
engagement
to
carlotta
and
when
they
all
came
to
the
wedding
i
d
make
the
the
most
conspicuous
of
wedding
presents
on
the
table
from
the
bridegroom
to
the
bride
by
george
i
d
cure
them
of
the
taste
for
i
wonder
what
impelled
me
to
tell
pasquale
of
the
proposed
yachting
cruise
we
sat
smoking
by
the
open
window
long
after
carlotta
had
been
sent
to
bed
and
looking
at
a
full
moon
sailing
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
park
enveloped
in
that
sensuous
atmosphere
of
a
warm
summer
night
which
induces
a
languor
in
the
body
and
in
the
will
on
such
a
night
as
this
young
lorenzo
if
he
happens
to
have
jessica
by
his
side
makes
a
confounded
idiot
of
himself
to
his
life
s
undoing
and
on
such
a
night
as
this
a
reserved
philosopher
commits
the
folly
of
discussing
his
private
affairs
with
a
sebastian
pasquale
but
if
he
is
correct
in
his
surmise
i
am
much
beholden
to
the
relaxing
influences
of
the
night
i
have
been
warned
of
perils
that
encompass
me
perils
that
would
infest
the
base
and
insidiously
scale
the
sides
of
the
most
inaccessible
tower
that
man
could
build
on
the
edge
of
the
regent
s
park
a
woman
with
a
matrimonial
purpose
would
be
quite
capable
of
gaining
access
by
balloon
to
my
turret
window
is
it
not
my
aunt
jessica
s
design
melodramatically
to
abduct
me
in
a
yacht
once
aboard
the
pirate
lugger
and
the
man
is
ours
she
cries
but
the
man
is
not
coming
aboard
the
pirate
lugger
he
is
going
to
keep
as
far
as
he
possibly
can
from
the
shore
neither
is
he
to
be
lured
into
bringing
his
lovely
mohammedan
ward
with
him
as
an
evidence
of
good
faith
and
unimpeachable
morals
they
can
regard
her
as
a
mohammedan
ward
or
a
houri
or
a
princess
of
babylon
just
as
they
choose
pasquale
must
be
right
a
hundred
remembered
incidents
go
to
prove
it
i
recollect
now
that
judith
has
rallied
me
on
my
obtuseness
the
sole
end
of
all
my
aunt
jessica
s
manoeuvring
is
to
marry
me
to
dora
and
dora
like
barkis
is
willing
marry
dora
the
thought
is
a
febrifuge
a
sudorific
she
would
be
thumping
discords
on
my
wornout
strings
all
day
long
in
a
month
i
should
be
a
writhing
madman
i
would
sooner
infinitely
sooner
marry
carlotta
carlotta
is
nature
dora
isn
t
even
art
why
in
the
name
of
men
and
angels
should
i
marry
dora
and
why
save
to
call
herself
lady
ordeyne
should
she
want
to
marry
me
i
have
not
trifled
with
her
virgin
affections
and
that
she
is
nourishing
a
romantic
passion
for
me
of
spontaneous
growth
i
decline
to
believe
for
aught
i
care
she
can
be
as
inconsolable
as
calypso
it
will
do
her
good
she
can
write
a
little
story
about
it
in
sirens
i
am
shocked
for
all
her
bouncing
ways
and
animal
health
and
incorrect
information
i
thought
dora
was
a
girl
do
girls
hunt
husbands
good
heavens
this
looks
like
the
subject
of
a
correspondence
in
daily
chapter
xi
july
hither
have
i
fled
from
my
buccaneering
relations
i
am
seeking
shelter
in
a
manse
in
the
midst
of
a
scotch
moor
and
the
village
half
a
mile
away
is
itself
five
miles
from
a
railway
station
here
i
can
defy
aunt
jessica
after
my
conversation
with
pasquale
i
passed
a
restless
night
my
slumbers
were
haunted
by
dreams
of
pirate
yachts
flying
the
jolly
roger
on
which
the
skull
and
crossbones
melted
grotesquely
into
a
and
a
true
lovers
knot
i
awoke
to
the
conviction
that
so
long
as
the
vessel
remained
on
english
waters
i
could
find
no
security
in
london
i
resolved
on
flight
but
whither
verily
the
high
gods
must
hold
me
in
peculiar
favour
the
first
letter
i
opened
was
from
old
simon
mcquhatty
my
present
host
a
godfather
of
my
mother
who
alone
of
mortals
befriended
us
in
the
dark
days
of
long
ago
he
was
old
and
infirm
he
wrote
and
gossip
death
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
moor
but
before
he
went
to
join
him
he
would
like
to
see
susan
s
boy
again
i
could
come
whenever
i
liked
a
telegram
from
euston
before
i
started
would
be
sufficient
notice
i
sent
stenson
out
with
a
telegram
to
say
i
was
starting
that
very
day
by
the
two
o
clock
train
and
i
wrote
a
polite
letter
to
my
aunt
jessica
informing
her
of
my
regret
at
not
being
able
to
accept
her
kind
invitation
as
i
was
summoned
to
scotland
for
an
indefinite
period
my
old
friend
s
ministry
in
the
free
kirk
of
scotland
is
drawing
to
a
close
he
has
lived
in
this
manse
a
stone
s
throw
from
his
grave
for
fifty
years
and
the
approaching
change
of
habitat
will
cost
him
nothing
he
will
still
lie
at
the
foot
of
his
beloved
hills
and
the
purple
moorland
will
spread
around
him
for
all
eternity
and
the
smell
of
the
gorse
and
heather
will
fill
his
nostrils
as
he
sleeps
he
is
a
bit
of
a
pagan
old
mcquhatty
in
spite
of
calvin
and
the
shorter
catechism
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
were
the
original
of
the
story
of
the
minister
who
prayed
for
the
puir
he
planted
a
rowan
tree
by
his
porch
when
he
was
first
inducted
into
the
manse
and
it
has
grown
up
with
him
and
he
loves
it
as
if
it
were
a
human
being
he
has
had
many
bonny
arguments
with
it
he
says
on
points
of
doctrine
and
it
has
brought
comfort
to
him
in
times
of
doubt
by
shivering
its
delicate
leaves
and
whispering
dinna
fash
yoursel
mcquhatty
the
lord
god
is
a
sensible
he
declares
that
the
words
are
articulate
and
i
suspect
that
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
believes
that
there
are
tongues
in
trees
and
books
in
the
running
brooks
just
as
he
is
convinced
that
there
is
good
in
everything
he
is
a
ripe
and
whimsical
scholar
and
his
talk
even
in
infirm
old
age
is
marked
by
a
doric
virility
which
has
rendered
his
companionship
for
these
five
days
as
stimulating
as
the
moorland
air
how
few
men
have
this
gift
of
discharging
intellectual
invigoration
indeed
i
only
know
old
mcquhatty
who
has
it
and
a
sportive
providence
has
carefully
excluded
mankind
from
its
benefits
for
half
a
century
stay
it
once
fostered
a
genius
who
arose
in
campsie
and
sent
him
strung
with
tonic
to
edinburgh
to
become
a
poet
but
the
poor
lad
drank
whisky
for
two
years
without
cessation
so
that
he
died
and
mcquhatty
s
inspiration
was
wasted
what
intellectual
stimulus
can
he
afford
for
instance
to
sandy
mcgrath
an
elder
of
the
kirk
whom
i
saw
coming
up
the
brae
on
sunday
an
old
ram
stood
in
the
path
and
as
obstinate
as
he
refused
to
budge
and
as
they
looked
dourly
at
each
other
i
wondered
if
the
ram
were
dressed
in
black
broadcloth
and
mcgrath
in
wool
whether
either
of
their
mothers
would
notice
the
metamorphosis
yet
my
host
declares
that
i
see
with
the
eyes
of
a
southron
that
the
scotch
peasant
when
he
is
not
drunk
is
intellectual
and
that
there
is
no
occasion
on
which
he
is
not
ready
for
theological
disputation
but
i
dinna
mind
telling
you
he
added
that
i
d
as
lief
talk
with
my
rowan
tree
it
does
nae
blaze
into
a
conflagration
at
a
comfortable
wee
bit
of
false
i
should
love
to
stay
all
the
summer
with
my
old
friend
it
seems
that
only
from
such
a
remote
solitude
can
one
view
things
mundane
in
the
right
perspective
and
in
their
true
proportion
one
would
see
how
important
or
unimportant
portent
in
the
cosmos
was
the
agricultural
ant
s
dream
of
three
millimetres
and
an
aphis
compared
with
the
aspirations
of
the
english
labourer
one
would
justly
focus
the
south
african
millionaire
sandy
mcgrath
and
the
ram
and
bring
them
to
their
real
lowest
common
denominator
one
would
even
be
able
to
gauge
the
value
of
a
history
of
renaissance
morals
the
benefits
i
should
derive
from
a
long
sojourn
are
incalculable
but
my
new
responsibilities
call
me
back
to
london
and
its
refracting
and
distorting
atmosphere
if
i
had
dwelt
here
for
fifty
years
i
should
have
perceived
that
carlotta
was
but
a
speck
in
the
whirlwind
of
human
dust
whose
ultimate
destiny
was
immaterial
as
my
five
days
visit
however
has
not
advanced
me
to
that
pitch
of
wisdom
i
am
foolishly
concerned
in
my
mind
as
to
her
welfare
and
anxious
to
dissolve
the
triumvirate
miss
griggs
stenson
and
antoinette
whom
i
have
entrusted
with
the
reins
of
government
a
month
ago
in
similar
circumstances
i
should
have
railed
at
fate
and
anathematised
carlotta
from
the
tip
of
her
pink
toes
to
the
gold
and
bronze
glory
of
her
hair
but
i
am
growing
more
kindly
disposed
towards
carlotta
and
taking
a
keen
interest
in
her
spiritual
development
an
inner
voice
an
ironical
sardonic
inner
voice
with
which
there
is
no
arguing
tells
me
that
i
am
a
hypocrite
that
an
interest
in
carlotta
s
spiritual
development
is
a
nice
comforting
phrase
which
has
deluded
philosophic
guardians
of
female
youth
for
many
generations
what
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
she
has
a
soul
or
not
says
the
voice
provided
she
can
babble
pleasantly
at
dinner
and
play
cribbage
with
you
afterwards
well
what
on
earth
does
it
matter
july
she
was
at
euston
to
meet
me
as
soon
as
she
saw
my
face
at
the
carriage
window
she
left
stenson
and
flew
up
the
platform
like
a
pretty
tame
animal
and
when
i
alighted
hung
on
my
arms
and
frisked
and
gamboled
around
me
in
excess
of
joy
so
you
are
glad
to
have
me
back
carlotta
i
asked
as
we
were
driving
home
she
sidled
up
against
me
in
her
terrier
fashion
oh
she
cooed
the
day
was
night
without
that
is
the
oriental
language
of
exaggeration
i
said
but
all
the
same
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
and
the
soft
notes
of
her
voice
coiled
themselves
as
music
sometimes
dus
around
my
heart
i
love
dear
seer
marcous
she
said
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
for
a
moment
as
one
would
do
to
a
child
you
are
a
good
little
girl
carlotta
that
is
to
say
i
added
remembering
my
responsibilities
if
you
been
good
have
you
oh
so
good
antoinette
has
been
teaching
me
how
to
cook
and
i
can
make
a
rice
pudding
it
is
so
nice
to
cook
things
i
like
the
smell
but
i
burned
myself
she
pulled
off
her
glove
and
showed
me
a
red
mark
on
her
hand
i
kissed
it
to
make
it
well
and
she
laughed
and
was
very
happy
and
i
too
was
happy
something
new
and
fresh
and
bright
has
come
into
my
life
stenson
is
an
admirable
servant
but
his
impassive
face
and
correct
salute
which
have
hitherto
greeted
me
at
london
railway
termini
although
suggestive
of
material
comfort
can
not
be
said
to
invest
my
arrival
with
a
special
atmosphere
of
charm
carlotta
s
welcome
has
been
a
new
sensation
i
look
upon
the
house
with
different
eyes
it
was
a
pleasure
as
i
dressed
for
dinner
to
reflect
that
i
should
not
go
down
to
a
solemn
solitary
meal
but
would
have
my
beautiful
little
witch
to
keep
me
company
july
it
appears
that
her
conduct
has
not
been
by
any
means
irreproachable
miss
griggs
reported
that
she
took
advantage
of
my
absence
to
saturate
herself
with
scent
one
of
the
most
heinous
crimes
in
our
domestic
calendar
bene
olet
dum
nihil
is
the
maxim
written
above
this
article
of
our
code
once
when
she
disobeyed
my
orders
and
came
into
the
reeking
of
i
sent
her
upstairs
to
change
all
her
things
and
have
a
bath
and
not
come
near
me
till
antoinette
vouched
for
her
scentlessness
and
ah
monsieur
i
remember
antoinette
replied
that
would
be
impossible
for
the
sweet
lamb
smells
of
spring
flowers
son
which
is
true
her
use
of
violent
perfumes
is
thus
a
double
offence
there
is
something
more
serious
said
miss
griggs
i
can
hardly
believe
there
can
be
anything
more
serious
than
making
one
s
self
detestable
to
one
s
said
i
unless
it
is
making
one
s
self
too
agreeable
said
miss
griggs
pointedly
i
asked
her
what
she
meant
i
have
discovered
she
replied
that
carlotta
has
been
carrying
on
a
clandestine
flirtation
with
the
young
man
who
calls
for
orders
from
the
grocer
i
am
glad
it
wasn
t
the
butcher
s
boy
i
murmured
miss
griggs
giggled
in
a
silly
way
as
if
i
were
jesting
at
my
stern
request
she
recovered
and
unfolded
the
horrible
tale
she
had
caught
carlotta
kissing
her
hand
to
him
she
had
also
seen
him
smuggle
a
note
between
carlotta
s
fingers
and
carlotta
had
definitely
refused
to
surrender
the
what
is
the
modern
course
of
treatment
i
asked
prescribed
for
young
ladies
who
flirt
with
grocers
assistants
in
renaissance
times
she
could
be
whipped
the
wise
margaret
of
navarre
used
to
beat
her
daughter
jeanne
d
albrecht
soundly
for
far
less
culpable
lapses
from
duty
or
she
could
be
sent
to
a
convent
and
put
into
a
cell
with
rats
or
she
could
be
bidden
to
attend
at
a
where
the
chief
attraction
was
roast
grocer
s
assistant
but
nowadays
what
do
you
suggest
the
unimaginative
creature
could
suggest
nothing
she
thought
that
i
would
know
how
to
deal
with
the
offence
perhaps
preventive
measures
would
be
more
efficacious
than
punishment
but
what
do
i
know
of
the
repressory
methods
employed
in
seminaries
for
young
ladies
burton
in
his
anatomy
speaks
cheerfully
of
behind
the
ears
he
also
quotes
i
remember
hippocrates
or
somebody
who
narrates
that
a
noble
maiden
was
cured
of
a
flirtatious
temperament
by
wearing
down
her
back
for
three
weeks
a
leaden
plate
pierced
with
holes
this
i
told
miss
griggs
who
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
father
of
medicine
he
also
recommends
whether
for
this
complaint
or
for
something
similar
i
forget
for
the
moment
said
i
anointing
the
soles
of
the
feet
with
the
fat
of
a
dormouse
the
teeth
with
the
of
a
dog
and
speaks
highly
of
a
ram
s
lungs
applied
hot
to
the
fore
part
of
the
head
i
am
sorry
these
admirable
remedies
are
out
of
date
there
is
a
rich
rabelaisianism
about
them
instead
of
the
satisfying
jorums
of
our
forefathers
we
take
tasteless
pellets
which
procure
us
no
sensation
at
the
time
and
even
the
good
old
hot
mustard
poultice
is
a
thing
of
the
but
what
about
carlotta
inquired
miss
griggs
anxiously
that
is
just
like
a
woman
to
interrupt
a
man
when
he
is
beginning
to
talk
comfortably
on
a
subject
that
interests
him
i
sighed
send
carlotta
up
to
me
i
said
resignedly
another
morning
s
work
spoiled
i
turned
to
my
i
had
just
transcribed
on
my
the
anecdote
told
with
such
glee
by
machiavelli
about
zanobi
del
pino
a
sort
of
admiral
byng
of
the
early
fifteenth
century
who
was
locked
up
and
given
nothing
to
eat
but
paper
painted
with
snakes
so
that
he
died
fasting
in
a
few
days
i
had
an
apt
epigram
on
the
subject
of
renaissance
humour
trembling
on
my
when
miss
griggs
came
in
with
her
foolish
gossip
i
am
sure
the
platitude
i
wrote
afterwards
is
not
that
original
flash
of
wit
carlotta
entered
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
side
of
my
her
great
dark
eyes
fixed
on
me
and
her
hands
dutifully
behind
her
back
she
looked
a
greuze
picture
of
innocence
i
believed
less
than
ever
in
the
enormity
of
the
offence
do
you
know
what
you
re
here
for
i
asked
magisterially
she
nodded
then
you
been
making
love
to
the
young
man
from
the
grocer
s
she
nodded
again
i
began
to
conceive
a
violent
dislike
to
the
grocer
s
young
man
it
was
one
of
the
most
humiliating
sensations
i
have
experienced
i
think
i
have
seen
the
individual
a
freckled
nondescript
what
did
you
do
it
for
i
asked
he
wanted
to
make
love
to
me
replied
carlotta
he
is
a
young
scamp
said
i
what
is
a
scamp
she
asked
sweetly
i
am
not
giving
you
a
lesson
in
philology
i
remarked
do
you
know
that
you
have
been
behaving
in
a
shocking
manner
now
you
are
cross
with
yes
i
said
infernally
and
i
was
i
expected
to
see
her
burst
into
tears
she
did
nothing
of
the
kind
only
looked
at
me
with
irritating
demureness
she
wore
a
red
blouse
and
a
grey
skirt
and
the
audacious
red
slippers
i
began
to
feel
the
return
of
my
early
prejudice
against
her
nobody
so
alluring
could
possess
a
spark
of
virtue
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
i
i
make
many
allowances
for
your
lack
of
knowledge
of
our
western
customs
but
for
a
young
lady
to
flirt
with
an
ugly
varlet
of
the
lower
orders
is
reprehensible
all
the
world
he
gave
me
dates
and
dried
fruits
with
sugar
all
over
them
said
carlotta
stolen
from
his
employer
i
said
i
will
have
that
young
man
locked
up
in
prison
and
if
you
go
on
receiving
his
feloniously
obtained
presents
they
will
put
you
in
prison
too
and
i
shall
be
carlotta
maintained
her
demure
expression
and
extracted
from
her
skirt
pocket
a
very
dirty
piece
of
paper
he
writes
poetry
about
me
she
remarked
handing
me
what
i
recognised
as
the
note
i
took
the
thing
between
finger
and
thumb
and
glanced
over
the
poem
i
have
read
much
indifferent
modern
verse
in
my
time
i
sometimes
take
a
after
tea
at
the
club
but
i
could
not
have
imagined
the
english
language
capable
of
such
emulsion
it
was
execrable
the
first
couplet
alone
contained
an
idea
thou
art
a
lovely
girl
and
so
very
nice
i
dream
till
death
upon
your
to
the
wretch
s
ear
it
was
a
rhyme
i
destroyed
the
noisome
thing
and
cast
it
into
the
basket
prison
said
i
would
be
a
luxurious
reward
for
him
in
a
properly
civilised
country
he
would
be
bastinadoed
and
yes
he
is
dam
bad
said
carlotta
serenely
good
heavens
i
cried
the
ruffian
has
even
taught
you
to
swear
if
you
dare
to
say
that
wicked
word
again
i
ll
punish
you
severely
what
is
his
horrid
name
pasquale
said
carlotta
pasquale
yes
he
likes
to
hear
me
say
oh
the
other
oh
no
he
is
too
stupid
he
does
not
say
anything
his
name
is
timkins
i
only
play
with
him
he
is
so
funny
he
can
go
and
kill
himself
i
won
t
never
mind
about
timkins
said
i
i
want
to
hear
about
pasquale
when
did
he
teach
you
that
wicked
wicked
word
i
think
carlotta
flushed
as
she
regarded
the
point
of
her
red
slipper
i
went
for
a
walk
and
he
met
me
at
the
corner
and
walked
here
by
my
side
was
that
wicked
what
would
the
excellent
hamdi
effendi
have
said
to
it
she
evaded
my
question
i
hope
hamdi
is
dead
do
you
think
so
i
hope
not
for
if
you
behave
in
this
naughty
manner
i
shall
have
to
send
you
back
to
she
had
imperceptibly
moved
nearer
my
chair
until
she
stood
quite
close
to
my
side
so
that
as
i
spoke
the
last
words
i
looked
up
into
her
face
she
put
her
arm
about
my
shoulders
it
is
one
of
her
pretty
caressing
ways
i
will
be
good
very
good
she
said
you
will
have
to
said
i
leaning
back
my
head
she
must
have
caught
a
relenting
note
in
my
voice
for
what
happened
i
feel
even
now
a
curious
shame
in
noting
down
her
other
arm
flew
under
my
chin
to
join
its
fellow
and
holding
me
a
prisoner
in
my
chair
she
bent
down
and
kissed
me
she
also
laid
her
cheek
against
mine
i
am
still
aware
of
the
indescribable
soft
warm
pressure
although
she
has
gone
to
bed
hours
ago
i
vow
that
a
man
must
be
less
a
man
than
a
petrified
egg
to
have
repulsed
her
the
touch
of
her
lips
was
like
the
falling
of
dewy
her
breath
was
as
fragrant
as
hay
her
hair
brushing
my
forehead
had
the
odour
of
violets
i
sent
her
back
to
miss
griggs
she
ran
out
of
the
room
laughing
merrily
she
has
received
plenary
absolution
for
her
shameless
coquetry
and
her
profane
language
worse
than
that
she
has
discovered
how
to
obtain
it
in
future
the
witch
has
found
her
witchcraft
and
having
once
triumphantly
exerted
her
powers
will
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
doing
so
again
i
am
fallen
both
in
my
own
eyes
and
hers
from
my
high
estate
henceforward
she
will
regard
me
only
with
tolerance
i
shall
be
to
her
but
a
timkins
i
was
an
idiot
to
have
kissed
her
in
return
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
lunched
at
the
club
and
paid
a
formal
call
on
ralph
ordeyne
and
my
cousin
rosalie
in
their
sunless
house
in
kensington
i
met
a
singular
lack
of
welcome
rosalie
gave
me
a
limper
hand
than
usual
and
took
an
early
opportunity
of
leaving
me
with
her
mother
who
conversed
frigidly
about
the
warm
weather
the
very
tea
if
possible
was
colder
i
met
judith
by
appointment
in
kensington
gardens
and
walked
with
her
homewards
i
mentioned
my
chilly
reception
my
dear
man
she
observed
i
dislike
this
apostrophe
which
judith
always
uses
by
way
of
introduction
to
an
unpleasant
remark
my
dear
man
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
as
unsavoury
a
reputation
as
any
one
in
london
you
are
credited
with
an
establishment
like
solomon
s
minus
the
respectable
of
the
wives
and
your
devout
relatives
are
very
properly
i
said
that
it
was
monstrous
judith
retorted
that
i
had
brought
the
calumny
upon
myself
but
what
can
i
do
i
asked
board
her
out
with
a
suburban
family
as
you
should
have
done
from
the
first
even
i
who
am
not
consider
it
highly
improper
for
you
to
have
her
alone
with
you
in
the
my
dear
said
i
there
is
tush
or
something
like
it
said
judith
and
stenson
no
one
seeing
stenson
could
doubt
the
irreproachable
propriety
of
his
i
really
have
no
patience
with
you
said
judith
it
is
hopeless
to
discuss
carlotta
with
her
i
shall
do
it
no
more
we
sat
for
a
while
under
the
trees
and
conversed
on
rational
topics
she
likes
her
employment
with
willoughby
the
morning
she
spends
among
blue
books
and
other
waste
matter
at
the
british
museum
and
she
devotes
the
evening
to
sorting
her
information
willoughby
commends
her
highly
and
there
is
something
i
know
you
ll
be
very
pleased
to
hear
she
continued
who
do
you
think
called
on
me
yesterday
willoughby
her
husband
wants
me
to
spend
august
and
september
at
a
place
they
have
taken
in
north
wales
and
help
him
with
his
new
book
as
a
private
secretary
you
know
i
said
that
i
never
went
into
society
i
must
tell
you
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
her
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
in
the
sweetest
way
in
the
world
and
said
i
know
all
about
it
my
dear
and
that
is
why
i
thought
i
d
come
myself
as
harold
s
wasn
t
it
beautiful
of
her
she
looked
at
me
and
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
marcus
dear
i
am
not
a
bad
woman
am
i
my
dearest
i
answered
very
deeply
touched
you
are
the
best
woman
in
the
world
so
far
from
conferring
a
favour
on
you
willoughby
has
gained
for
herself
the
inestimable
privilege
of
your
ah
said
judith
a
man
can
not
tell
what
it
really
men
are
not
such
dullard
dunderheads
as
women
are
pleased
to
imagine
i
have
the
most
crystalline
perception
of
what
willoughby
s
invitation
means
to
judith
women
appear
to
find
a
morbid
satisfaction
in
the
fiction
that
their
sex
is
actuated
by
a
mysterious
nexus
of
emotions
and
motives
which
the
grosser
sense
of
man
is
powerless
to
appreciate
in
her
heart
of
hearts
it
is
a
prodigious
comfort
to
a
woman
to
feel
herself
misunderstood
even
she
who
is
most
perfectly
mated
and
is
intellectually
convinced
that
the
difference
of
sex
is
no
barrier
to
his
complete
knowledge
of
her
loves
to
cherish
some
little
secret
bit
of
her
nature
to
which
on
account
of
his
masculinity
will
be
eternally
blind
of
course
there
are
dull
men
who
could
not
understand
a
tabbycat
or
a
professional
cricketer
let
alone
an
expert
autothaumaturgist
a
like
a
woman
but
an
intelligent
and
painstaking
man
should
find
no
difficulty
in
appreciating
what
after
all
is
merely
a
point
of
view
for
what
women
see
from
that
point
of
view
they
are
as
indiscreet
in
revealing
as
a
babe
i
have
confessed
before
that
i
do
not
understand
judith
that
is
to
say
the
whole
welter
of
contradictions
in
which
her
ego
consists
but
that
is
solely
because
i
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
subject
her
to
special
microscopic
study
such
a
scientific
analysis
would
i
think
be
an
immodest
discourtesy
towards
any
lady
of
my
acquaintance
especially
towards
one
for
whom
i
bear
considerable
affection
it
would
be
as
unwarrantable
for
a
man
to
speculate
upon
her
exact
spiritual
dimensions
as
upon
those
portions
of
her
physical
frame
that
are
hidden
beneath
her
attire
the
charm
of
human
intercourse
rests
to
a
great
extent
on
the
vague
the
deliberately
unperceived
the
stimulating
sense
that
an
individual
possesses
more
attributes
than
flash
upon
the
bodily
or
mental
eye
but
this
i
say
is
deliberate
one
knows
perfectly
well
that
beneath
her
skirts
any
young
woman
you
please
does
not
melt
away
into
the
scaly
tail
of
a
mermaid
but
has
a
pair
of
ordinary
commonplace
legs
one
knows
that
when
she
has
passed
through
certain
well
defined
experiences
in
life
a
certain
definite
range
of
sentiments
must
exist
behind
whatever
mask
of
facial
expression
she
may
choose
to
adopt
it
is
sheer
nonsense
therefore
for
judith
to
say
that
i
can
not
enter
into
her
feelings
with
regard
to
willoughby
s
invitation
i
developed
this
theme
very
fully
to
judith
as
we
sat
in
kensington
gardens
and
during
our
subsequent
stroll
diagonally
through
hyde
park
to
the
marble
arch
she
listened
with
great
attention
and
when
i
had
finished
regarded
me
in
a
pitying
manner
a
smile
flickering
over
her
lips
my
dear
marcus
she
said
there
is
no
man
however
who
has
not
one
colossal
vanity
his
knowledge
of
women
he
at
any
rate
has
established
the
veritable
theory
of
women
and
we
laugh
at
you
my
good
friend
for
the
more
you
expound
the
more
do
you
reveal
your
beautiful
and
artistic
ignorance
oh
marcus
the
idea
of
you
setting
up
as
a
feminine
and
pray
why
not
i
asked
somewhat
nettled
because
you
are
that
dear
impossible
lovable
thing
known
as
marcus
this
was
exceedingly
pretty
of
judith
but
really
woman
is
the
eternal
philistine
as
matthew
arnold
has
defined
the
term
her
supreme
characteristic
is
inconvincibility
i
had
simply
wasted
my
breath
chapter
xii
august
a
young
fellow
on
the
casino
terrace
this
evening
caught
my
eye
looked
at
me
queerly
and
passed
on
his
face
though
unfamiliar
stirred
some
dormant
association
what
was
it
the
profitless
question
pestered
me
for
hours
at
last
during
the
performance
at
the
theatre
i
slapped
my
knee
and
said
aloud
i
ve
got
it
what
asked
carlotta
in
alarm
a
fly
i
answered
whereat
carlotta
laughed
and
bent
forward
to
get
a
view
of
the
victim
i
austerely
directed
her
attention
to
the
stage
it
was
a
metaphorical
fly
whose
buzzing
i
had
stopped
the
young
fellow
was
he
who
had
pointed
me
out
in
hyde
park
to
his
companion
and
lightly
assured
her
that
i
was
as
mad
as
a
dingo
dog
from
the
moment
after
the
phrase
s
utterance
to
that
of
the
slapping
of
my
knee
it
had
been
altogether
absent
from
my
mind
now
it
haunts
me
it
reiterates
itself
after
the
manner
of
a
glib
phrase
i
am
glad
i
am
not
in
a
railway
carriage
the
cranks
would
amuse
the
wheels
with
it
all
night
long
as
it
is
the
surf
tries
to
thunder
it
out
on
the
shingle
just
a
few
yards
away
from
my
window
i
keep
asking
myself
why
a
dingo
dog
if
i
am
mad
it
is
in
a
gentle
jaquesian
melancholy
manner
i
do
not
dash
at
life
rabid
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
i
think
the
idiot
simile
must
have
been
merely
the
misuse
of
language
so
common
among
the
youth
of
great
britain
yet
when
i
come
to
consider
my
present
condition
i
have
doubts
as
to
my
complete
sanity
here
am
i
in
a
little
french
seaside
place
away
from
my
books
and
my
comforts
and
my
habits
as
much
interested
in
its
vapid
distractions
as
if
the
universe
held
no
other
pursuits
worth
the
attention
of
a
rational
man
and
i
have
been
here
a
calendar
month
to
please
carlotta
i
wear
white
duck
trousers
a
pink
shirt
and
a
i
wired
for
them
to
my
london
tailor
and
they
arrived
within
a
week
the
first
time
i
appeared
in
the
maniacal
costume
i
slunk
from
the
stony
stare
of
a
gendarme
as
i
was
about
to
ascend
the
casino
steps
and
hid
myself
among
the
lower
down
on
the
beach
carlotta
however
was
delighted
and
said
that
i
looked
pretty
now
i
have
grown
callous
seeing
other
fools
similarly
apparelled
but
a
year
ago
should
i
have
dreamed
it
possible
for
me
to
strut
about
a
fashionable
in
white
ducks
a
pink
shirt
and
a
i
trow
not
they
are
signs
of
some
sort
of
madness
whether
that
of
a
jaques
or
a
dingo
dog
matters
very
little
pasquale
was
the
main
cause
of
my
taking
carlotta
away
from
london
he
came
far
too
frequently
to
the
house
established
far
too
great
a
familiarity
with
my
little
girl
she
quoted
him
far
too
readily
she
is
at
the
impressionable
age
when
young
women
fall
easy
victims
to
the
allurements
of
a
fascinating
creature
like
pasquale
if
he
showed
himself
in
the
light
of
a
possible
husband
for
carlotta
i
should
have
nothing
to
say
i
should
give
the
pair
my
paternal
benediction
but
i
know
my
renaissance
and
i
know
my
pasquale
carlotta
is
merely
a
new
sensation
that
s
all
he
seems
to
live
for
the
delectable
scoundrel
but
i
am
not
going
to
have
her
heart
broken
by
any
cinquecento
wolf
in
poole
s
clothing
i
assume
that
carlotta
has
a
heart
even
if
she
is
not
possessed
of
a
soul
as
to
the
latter
i
am
still
in
doubt
at
all
events
i
resolved
to
withdraw
carlotta
from
his
influence
put
her
in
fresh
surroundings
and
allow
her
to
mix
more
freely
among
men
and
women
so
as
to
divert
and
possibly
improve
her
mind
i
perceive
that
carlotta
is
becoming
an
occupation
well
she
is
quite
as
profitable
as
collecting
or
golf
or
amateur
photography
i
have
spent
a
pleasant
month
in
this
little
place
it
is
the
mouth
of
a
gorge
in
the
midst
of
a
coast
the
bay
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
sweep
is
shut
in
at
each
end
by
a
projecting
wall
of
cliff
cut
by
a
natural
arch
half
the
shingle
beach
is
given
up
to
fisherfolk
and
their
boats
and
tarred
noah
s
arks
where
they
keep
their
nets
the
other
half
suddenly
rises
into
a
digue
or
terrace
on
which
is
built
a
primitive
casino
and
below
the
terrace
are
the
we
are
staying
at
the
most
spotlessly
clean
of
all
clean
french
hotels
there
are
no
carpets
on
the
stairs
but
if
one
mounts
them
in
muddy
boots
an
untiring
chambermaid
emerges
from
a
lair
below
with
hot
water
and
and
smilingly
removes
the
traces
of
one
s
passage
carlotta
and
antoinette
have
adjoining
rooms
in
the
main
building
i
inhabit
the
annexe
sleeping
in
a
quaint
clean
bare
little
chamber
with
a
balconied
window
that
looks
over
the
noah
s
arks
and
the
and
fisherfolk
away
out
to
sea
this
morning
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
saw
our
channel
fleet
lie
along
the
arc
of
the
horizon
antoinette
dwells
in
continuous
rapture
at
being
in
france
again
carlotta
assures
me
that
the
smile
does
not
leave
her
great
red
face
even
as
she
sleeps
of
nights
it
is
a
little
jest
between
us
she
peeped
in
once
to
see
the
good
soul
has
filled
herself
up
with
french
conversation
as
a
starving
hen
gorges
herself
with
corn
she
has
scraped
acquaintance
with
every
washerwoman
bathing
woman
and
domestic
servant
on
the
beach
she
is
on
intimate
terms
with
the
whole
male
native
population
when
the
three
of
us
happen
to
walk
together
it
is
a
triumphal
progress
of
bows
and
grins
and
nods
at
first
i
thought
it
was
i
for
whom
this
homage
was
intended
i
was
soon
undeceived
it
was
antoinette
she
loves
to
parade
carlotta
before
her
friends
i
came
upon
her
once
entertaining
an
admiring
audience
in
carlotta
s
presence
with
a
detailed
description
of
that
young
woman
s
physical
perfections
a
description
which
was
marked
by
a
singular
lack
of
reticence
the
time
of
her
glory
is
the
bathing
hour
when
she
accompanies
carlotta
from
her
cabin
to
the
water
s
edge
divests
her
of
and
but
before
revealing
her
to
fashionable
etretat
casts
a
preliminary
glance
around
as
who
should
say
prepare
all
men
and
women
for
the
dazzling
goddess
i
am
about
to
carlotta
is
undoubtedly
bewitching
in
her
bathing
costume
and
enjoys
a
little
triumph
of
beauty
people
fall
into
a
natural
group
in
order
to
look
at
her
while
i
sitting
on
a
in
my
white
ducks
and
pink
shirt
and
smoking
a
cigarette
can
not
repress
a
complacent
pride
of
ownership
i
do
not
object
to
her
flicking
her
wet
fingers
at
me
when
she
comes
dripping
out
of
the
sea
and
i
do
not
even
reproach
her
when
she
puts
her
foot
upon
my
sartorially
immaculate
knee
to
show
me
a
on
her
glistening
pink
sole
her
conduct
has
been
exemplary
i
have
allowed
her
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
two
or
three
young
fellows
her
partners
at
the
casino
dances
and
she
walks
up
and
down
the
terrace
with
them
before
meals
i
have
forbidden
her
under
penalty
of
immediate
return
to
london
and
of
my
eternal
displeasure
to
mention
the
harem
at
alexandretta
young
fellows
are
gifted
with
a
genius
for
misapprehension
she
is
an
ordinary
young
english
lady
an
orphan
which
is
true
and
i
am
her
guardian
of
course
she
looks
at
them
with
imploring
eyes
and
pulls
them
by
the
sleeve
and
handles
the
lappels
of
their
coats
and
admits
them
to
terms
of
the
frankest
intimacy
but
i
can
no
more
change
these
characteristics
than
i
can
alter
the
shape
of
her
body
she
is
the
born
coquette
her
delighted
conception
of
herself
is
that
she
is
the
object
of
every
man
s
admiration
i
noticed
her
this
morning
playing
a
tune
with
her
fingers
on
the
old
s
arm
as
he
was
preparing
to
take
her
into
the
water
and
i
saw
his
mahogany
face
soften
in
her
indescribable
childish
way
she
would
coquet
with
a
or
a
man
or
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
but
she
has
committed
no
grave
indiscretion
and
i
am
sufficiently
her
lord
and
master
to
exact
obedience
i
pretend
however
to
be
at
her
beck
and
call
and
it
is
a
delight
to
minister
to
her
radiant
happiness
to
feel
her
lean
on
my
arm
and
hear
her
cooing
voice
say
you
are
so
good
i
should
like
to
kiss
but
i
do
not
allow
her
to
kiss
me
never
again
seer
marcous
let
us
go
to
the
little
she
has
a
consuming
passion
for
i
speak
sagely
of
the
evils
of
gambling
she
laughs
i
weakly
take
lower
ground
what
is
the
good
you
have
no
but
only
two
francs
she
says
holding
out
her
hand
not
one
yesterday
you
but
i
shall
win
i
want
to
give
you
something
i
saw
in
a
shop
oh
a
beautiful
then
i
feel
a
hand
steal
into
the
pocket
of
my
dinner
jacket
where
i
carry
loose
silver
for
this
very
purpose
just
as
a
lover
of
horses
carries
lumps
of
sugar
for
the
nose
of
a
favourite
pony
and
immediately
it
is
withdrawn
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
triumph
and
she
skips
back
out
of
my
reach
then
she
takes
my
arm
and
leads
me
from
the
sweet
into
the
hot
little
room
with
its
crowd
around
the
nine
gyrating
animals
i
shall
put
it
on
i
always
put
on
he
is
a
nice
clean
white
pretty
she
stakes
two
francs
watches
the
turn
in
a
tense
agony
of
excitement
she
wins
comes
running
to
me
with
sixteen
francs
clutched
tight
in
her
hand
see
i
said
i
should
come
away
then
and
be
but
she
makes
a
protesting
grimace
and
before
i
can
stop
her
runs
back
to
stake
again
on
in
twenty
minutes
she
is
ruined
and
returns
to
me
wearing
an
expression
of
abject
misery
she
is
too
desolate
even
to
try
the
fortune
of
the
pocket
i
take
her
outside
and
restore
her
to
beatitude
with
grenadine
syrup
and
she
rejects
the
straws
with
her
elbows
on
the
marble
table
the
glass
held
in
both
hands
she
drinks
sensuously
in
little
sips
and
i
marcus
ordeyne
sit
by
watching
her
a
most
contented
philosopher
of
forty
a
dingo
dog
could
not
be
so
contented
that
young
fellow
i
unhesitatingly
assert
must
be
the
most
brainless
of
his
type
i
suffer
fools
gladly
as
a
general
rule
but
if
i
see
much
of
this
one
i
shall
do
him
some
injury
after
dejeuner
we
strolled
to
the
top
of
the
west
cliff
and
lay
on
the
thick
dry
grass
the
earth
has
never
known
a
more
perfect
afternoon
a
day
of
turquoise
and
diamond
the
air
itself
was
diaphanous
blue
below
us
the
tiny
place
slumbered
in
the
sunshine
scarcely
a
sign
of
life
save
specks
of
on
the
beach
bending
over
white
patches
which
we
knew
were
linen
spread
out
to
dry
the
lapped
lazily
on
the
shingle
where
the
sea
changed
suddenly
from
ultramarine
to
a
fringe
of
feathery
white
a
white
sail
or
two
flecked
the
blue
of
the
bay
a
few
white
wisps
of
cirrus
gleamed
above
our
heads
around
us
on
the
the
green
pastures
and
meadows
and
farther
inland
the
cornfields
stacked
in
harvest
and
great
masses
of
trees
lying
on
our
backs
between
sea
and
sky
we
seemed
utterly
alone
carlotta
and
i
were
the
sole
inhabitants
of
the
earth
i
dreamily
disintegrated
caramels
from
their
sticky
wrappings
for
carlotta
s
consumption
after
a
while
unconquerable
drowsiness
crept
over
me
and
a
little
later
i
had
an
odd
sense
of
perfect
quietude
i
was
lying
amid
moss
and
violets
in
a
languorous
way
i
wondered
how
my
surroundings
had
changed
and
at
last
i
awoke
to
find
my
head
propped
on
carlotta
s
lap
and
shaded
by
her
red
parasol
while
she
sat
happy
in
full
sunshine
i
was
springing
from
this
posture
of
impropriety
when
she
laughed
and
laid
restraining
hands
on
my
shoulders
no
you
must
not
move
you
look
so
pretty
and
it
is
so
nice
i
put
your
head
there
so
that
it
should
be
soft
you
have
been
sound
i
have
also
been
abominably
impolite
said
i
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
oh
i
am
not
cross
she
laughed
then
still
keeping
her
hands
on
me
she
settled
her
limbs
into
a
more
comfortable
position
there
now
i
can
play
at
being
a
good
little
turkish
she
fashioned
into
a
fan
the
newspaper
which
i
had
bought
for
the
luxurious
purpose
of
not
reading
and
fanned
me
that
is
what
ayesha
used
to
do
to
hamdi
and
ayesha
used
to
tell
him
stories
but
my
lord
does
not
like
his
slave
s
decidedly
not
said
i
have
heard
much
of
ayesha
a
pretty
animal
organism
who
appears
to
have
turned
her
elderly
husband
into
a
doting
fool
i
am
beginning
to
have
a
contempt
for
hamdi
effendi
they
are
what
you
call
improper
eh
she
laughed
referring
to
the
tales
i
will
sing
you
a
turkish
song
which
you
will
not
is
it
a
suitable
song
kim
bilir
who
knows
said
carlotta
she
began
a
melancholy
crooning
guttural
ditty
but
broke
off
suddenly
oh
but
it
is
stupid
like
the
turkish
dancing
oh
everything
in
alexandretta
was
stupid
sometimes
i
think
i
have
never
seen
alexandretta
or
ayesha
or
hamdi
i
think
i
always
am
with
this
must
be
so
as
of
late
she
has
spoken
little
of
her
harem
life
she
talks
chiefly
of
the
small
daily
happenings
and
already
we
have
a
store
of
common
interests
the
present
is
her
whole
existence
the
past
but
a
confused
dream
the
odd
part
of
the
matter
is
that
she
regards
her
position
with
me
as
a
perfectly
natural
one
no
stray
kitten
adopted
by
a
kind
family
could
have
less
sense
of
obligation
or
a
greater
faith
in
the
serene
ordering
of
the
cosmos
for
its
own
private
and
peculiar
comfort
when
i
asked
her
a
while
ago
what
she
would
have
done
had
i
left
her
on
the
bench
in
the
embankment
gardens
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
answered
as
she
had
done
before
that
either
she
would
have
died
or
some
other
nice
gentleman
would
have
taken
care
of
her
do
you
think
nice
gentlemen
go
about
london
looking
for
homeless
little
girls
i
asked
on
that
occasion
all
gentlemen
like
beautiful
girls
she
replied
which
brought
us
to
an
old
argument
this
afternoon
however
we
did
not
argue
the
day
forbade
it
i
lay
with
my
head
on
carlotta
s
lap
looking
up
into
the
deep
blue
and
feeling
a
most
curious
sensation
of
positive
happiness
my
attitude
towards
life
has
hitherto
been
negative
i
have
avoided
more
than
i
have
sought
i
have
not
drunk
deep
of
life
because
i
have
been
unathirst
to
me
to
stand
aloof
and
view
the
fight
is
all
the
pleasure
of
the
my
interest
even
in
judith
has
been
of
a
detached
nature
i
have
been
like
faust
i
might
have
said
werd
ich
zum
augenblicke
sagen
werweile
doch
du
bist
so
schon
then
may
the
devil
take
me
and
do
what
he
likes
with
me
i
have
never
had
the
least
inclination
to
apostrophise
the
moment
in
this
fashion
and
request
it
to
tarry
on
account
of
its
exceeding
charm
never
until
this
afternoon
when
the
deep
summer
enchantment
of
the
turquoise
day
was
itself
ensorcelised
by
the
witchery
of
a
girl
s
springtide
you
have
three
four
five
oh
such
a
lot
of
grey
hairs
said
carlotta
looking
down
on
my
reclining
head
many
people
have
grey
hair
at
twenty
said
i
but
i
have
you
are
not
yet
twenty
do
you
think
i
will
have
them
then
oh
it
would
be
dreadful
no
one
would
care
to
have
and
i
am
i
thus
the
object
of
every
one
s
disregard
oh
you
you
are
a
man
it
is
right
for
a
man
it
makes
him
look
wise
his
wife
says
behold
my
husband
has
grey
hair
he
has
wisdom
if
i
am
not
good
he
will
beat
me
so
i
must
obey
she
wouldn
t
run
off
with
a
scamp
of
oh
said
carlotta
she
would
not
be
so
i
am
glad
said
i
that
you
think
a
sense
of
conjugal
duty
is
an
ineradicable
element
of
female
nature
but
suppose
she
fell
in
love
with
the
young
scamp
men
fall
in
love
she
replied
sagely
women
only
fall
in
love
in
stories
turkish
stories
they
love
their
you
amaze
me
said
i
said
carlotta
but
in
england
a
man
wants
a
woman
to
love
him
before
he
marries
how
can
she
asked
carlotta
this
was
a
staggering
question
i
don
t
know
said
i
but
she
then
before
i
marry
a
man
in
england
i
must
love
him
but
i
shall
die
without
a
husband
i
don
t
think
so
said
i
i
must
begin
soon
said
carlotta
with
a
laugh
a
sinuous
motion
of
her
serpentine
young
body
enabled
her
to
bend
her
face
down
to
mine
shall
i
love
seer
marcous
but
how
shall
i
know
when
i
am
in
love
when
you
appreciate
the
exceeding
impropriety
of
discussing
the
matter
with
your
humble
servant
i
replied
when
a
girl
is
in
love
she
does
not
speak
about
it
no
my
dear
she
lets
concealment
like
a
worm
i
the
bud
feed
on
her
damask
then
she
gets
ugly
that
s
it
i
answered
you
keep
on
looking
in
the
glass
and
when
you
perceive
you
are
hideous
then
you
ll
know
you
are
in
but
when
i
am
so
ugly
you
will
not
want
me
she
objected
so
it
is
no
use
falling
in
love
with
you
have
a
more
logical
mind
than
i
imagined
said
i
what
is
a
logical
mind
asked
carlotta
it
is
the
antiseptic
which
destroys
the
bacilli
of
unreason
whereby
true
happiness
is
i
do
not
understand
she
said
i
should
be
vastly
surprised
if
you
did
i
laughed
would
you
like
me
to
marry
and
go
away
and
leave
you
asked
carlotta
after
a
long
pause
i
suppose
i
said
with
a
sigh
that
some
knight
will
drive
up
one
of
these
days
to
the
castle
in
a
and
carry
off
my
then
you
ll
be
sorry
my
dear
i
answered
do
not
let
us
discuss
such
gruesome
things
on
an
afternoon
like
you
would
like
better
for
me
to
go
on
playing
at
being
your
turkish
wife
infinitely
said
alas
the
day
is
sped
i
have
asked
the
fleeting
moment
to
tarry
and
it
laughed
and
shook
its
gossamer
wings
at
me
and
flew
by
on
its
mad
race
into
eternity
as
we
lay
a
cicada
set
up
its
shrilling
quite
close
to
us
i
slipped
my
head
from
carlotta
s
lap
and
idly
parted
the
rank
grass
in
search
of
the
noisy
intruder
and
by
good
luck
i
found
him
i
beckoned
carlotta
who
glided
down
and
there
with
our
heads
together
and
holding
our
breath
we
watched
the
queerest
little
love
drama
imaginable
our
cicada
stood
alert
and
spruce
waving
his
antenna
with
a
sort
of
cavalier
swagger
and
every
now
and
then
making
his
corslet
vibrate
passionately
on
the
top
of
a
blade
of
grass
sat
a
brown
little
juliet
a
most
reserved
discreet
little
juliet
but
evidently
much
interested
in
romeo
s
serenade
when
he
sang
she
put
her
head
to
one
side
and
moved
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
descend
from
her
balcony
when
he
stopped
which
he
did
at
frequent
intervals
being
as
it
were
timorous
and
she
took
her
foot
from
the
ladder
and
waited
at
first
patiently
and
then
with
an
obvious
air
of
boredom
messer
romeo
made
a
hop
forward
and
vibrated
juliet
grew
tremulous
alarmed
at
his
boldness
he
halted
and
made
a
hop
back
juliet
looked
disappointed
at
last
another
cicada
set
up
a
louder
note
some
yards
away
and
without
a
nod
or
a
sign
juliet
skipped
off
into
space
leaving
the
most
disconsolate
little
romeo
of
a
grasshopper
you
ever
beheld
he
gave
vent
to
a
dismal
failure
of
a
vibration
and
hopped
to
the
foot
of
the
faithless
lady
s
bower
carlotta
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
and
clapped
her
hands
i
am
so
she
is
the
most
graceless
hussy
imaginable
i
cried
there
was
he
grinding
his
heart
out
for
her
and
just
because
a
more
scoundrel
came
upon
the
scene
she
must
needs
leave
our
poor
friend
in
the
lurch
she
has
no
more
heart
than
my
boot
and
she
will
come
to
a
bad
but
he
was
such
a
fool
retorted
my
sage
damsel
with
a
flash
of
laughter
in
her
dark
eyes
if
he
wanted
her
why
didn
t
he
go
up
and
take
her
because
he
is
a
gentleman
a
cicada
of
fine
and
delicate
laughed
carlotta
he
was
a
fool
it
served
him
right
she
grew
tired
of
you
believe
then
said
i
in
marriage
by
capture
i
explained
and
discoursed
to
her
of
the
matrimonial
habits
of
the
tartar
tribes
yes
said
carlotta
that
is
sense
and
it
must
be
such
fun
for
the
girl
all
that
what
you
call
it
wooing
is
waste
of
time
i
like
things
to
happen
quick
quick
one
after
the
other
or
else
or
else
what
to
do
nothing
nothing
but
lie
in
the
sun
like
this
yes
said
i
dreamily
after
i
had
again
thrown
myself
by
her
side
like
this
i
sit
at
my
window
and
look
out
upon
the
strip
of
beach
the
fishing
boats
and
the
nets
hung
out
to
dry
looming
vague
in
the
starlight
and
i
hear
the
surf
s
rhythmical
moan
a
few
yards
beyond
and
it
beats
into
my
ears
the
idiot
phrase
that
has
recurred
all
the
evening
but
why
should
i
be
mad
for
filling
my
soul
with
god
s
utmost
glory
of
earth
and
sea
and
sky
for
filling
my
heart
with
purest
pleasure
in
the
intimate
companionship
of
fresh
and
fragrant
maidenhood
for
giving
myself
up
for
once
to
a
dream
of
sense
clouded
by
never
a
thought
that
was
not
serenely
fair
for
feeling
young
again
i
shall
read
myself
to
sleep
with
dame
de
which
i
have
procured
from
the
circulating
library
in
the
rue
alphonse
karr
the
literary
horticulturist
is
the
genius
loci
and
the
godfather
of
my
landlady
and
i
will
empty
flagons
with
pere
gorenflot
and
ride
on
errands
of
life
and
death
with
chicot
prince
of
jesters
and
walk
lovingly
between
the
valiant
bussy
and

by
nothing

something
is
wrong
with
antoinette
the
dinner
she
served
up
this
evening
was
all
but
uneatable
something
is
wrong
with
stenson
who
has
taken
to
playing
his
lugubrious
on
the
concertina
while
i
am
in
the
house
i
won
t
have
it
something
is
wrong
with
the
cat
he
wanders
round
the
house
like
a
lost
soul
sniffing
at
everything
this
evening
he
actually
jumped
onto
the
looked
at
me
out
of
his
one
eye
in
which
all
the
desolation
of
two
was
concentrated
and
miaowed
in
my
face
something
is
wrong
with
the
house
with
my
pens
which
will
not
write
with
my
books
which
have
the
air
of
dry
bones
in
a
with
the
of
my
history
of
renaissance
morals
which
stands
on
the
like
a
dusty
monument
to
the
futility
of
human
endeavour
something
is
wrong
with
me
something
too
is
wrong
with
judith
who
has
just
returned
from
her
stay
with
the
willoughbys
i
have
been
to
see
her
this
evening
and
found
her
of
uncertain
temper
and
inclined
to
be
contradictious
she
accused
me
of
being
dull
i
answered
that
the
autumn
world
outside
was
drenched
with
miserable
rain
how
could
man
be
sprightly
under
such
conditions
in
this
room
said
judith
with
its
bright
fire
and
drawn
curtains
there
is
no
miserable
rain
and
no
autumn
save
in
our
why
in
our
hearts
i
asked
how
you
peg
one
down
to
precision
said
judith
testily
i
wish
i
were
a
roman
why
i
could
go
into
a
you
had
much
better
go
to
delphine
carrere
said
i
i
have
only
been
back
a
day
and
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
already
she
cried
using
her
woman
s
swift
logic
of
unreason
i
want
you
to
be
happy
and
contented
my
dear
h
m
she
said
her
slipper
dangling
as
usual
from
the
tip
of
her
foot
fell
to
the
ground
i
declare
i
was
only
half
conscious
of
the
accident
as
my
mind
was
deep
in
other
things
you
don
t
even
pick
up
my
slipper
she
said
ten
thousand
pardons
i
exclaimed
springing
forward
but
she
had
anticipated
my
intention
we
remained
staring
into
the
fire
and
saying
nothing
as
she
professed
to
be
tired
i
went
away
early
at
the
front
door
of
the
mansions
finding
i
had
left
my
umbrella
behind
i
remounted
the
stairs
and
rang
judith
s
bell
after
a
while
i
saw
her
figure
through
the
panel
approach
the
door
but
before
she
opened
it
she
turned
out
the
light
in
the
passage
marcus
she
cried
rather
excitedly
and
in
the
dimness
of
the
threshold
her
eyes
looked
strangely
accusative
of
tears
you
have
come
back
yes
said
i
for
my
she
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
laughed
clapped
her
hands
to
her
throat
turned
away
sharply
caught
up
my
umbrella
and
putting
it
into
my
hands
and
thrusting
me
back
shut
the
door
in
my
face
in
great
astonishment
i
went
downstairs
again
what
is
wrong
with
judith
she
said
this
evening
that
all
men
are
cruel
now
i
am
a
man
therefore
i
am
cruel
a
perfect
syllogism
but
how
have
i
been
cruel
i
walked
home
there
is
nothing
so
consoling
to
the
depressed
man
as
the
unmitigated
misery
of
a
walk
through
the
london
rain
one
is
not
mocked
by
any
factitious
gaiety
the
mind
is
in
harmony
with
the
sodden
universe
it
is
well
to
have
everything
in
the
world
wrong
at
one
and
the
same
time
i
have
changed
my
drenched
garments
for
and
slippers
i
find
on
my
a
letter
addressed
in
a
round
childish
hand
it
is
from
carlotta
who
for
the
last
fortnight
has
been
staying
in
cornwall
with
the
mcmurrays
i
have
known
few
fortnights
so
long
in
a
ridiculous
schoolboy
way
i
have
been
counting
the
days
to
her
return
the
day
after
the
letter
begins
seer
marcous
the
spelling
is
a
little
jest
between
us
the
inversion
is
a
quaint
invention
of
her
own
mrs
mcmurray
says
can
you
spare
me
for
one
more
week
she
wants
to
teach
me
manners
she
says
i
have
shocked
the
top
priest
here
oh
you
call
him
a
vikker
now
i
do
remember
because
i
went
out
for
a
walk
with
a
little
young
pretty
priest
without
a
hat
and
because
it
rained
i
put
on
his
hat
and
the
vikker
met
us
but
i
did
not
flirt
with
the
little
priest
oh
no
i
told
him
he
must
not
make
love
to
me
like
the
young
man
from
the
grocer
s
and
i
told
him
that
if
he
wrote
poetry
you
would
beat
him
so
i
have
been
very
good
and
darling
seer
marcous
i
want
to
come
back
very
much
but
mcmurray
says
i
must
stay
and
she
is
going
to
have
a
baby
and
i
am
very
happy
and
good
and
mcmurray
says
funny
things
and
makes
me
laugh
but
i
love
my
darling
seer
marcous
best
give
antoinette
and
polifemus
the
cat
two
very
nice
kisses
for
me
and
here
is
one
for
seer
marcous
from
his
how
can
i
refuse
but
i
wish
she
were
here
october
i
did
not
sleep
last
night
i
have
done
no
work
the
renaissance
has
receded
into
a
glacial
epoch
wherein
as
far
as
its
humanity
is
concerned
i
have
not
a
tittle
of
interest
i
sought
refuge
in
the
club
why
should
an
old
sober
university
club
be
such
a
haven
of
unrest
ponting
an
opinionated
don
of
corpus
seated
himself
at
my
luncheon
table
and
discoursed
on
political
economy
and
golf
i
manifested
a
polite
ignorance
of
these
high
matters
he
assured
me
that
if
i
studied
the
one
and
played
at
the
other
i
should
be
physically
and
mentally
more
robust
whereupon
he
thumped
his
narrow
chest
and
put
on
a
scowl
of
intellectuality
i
fear
that
ponting
like
most
of
the
men
here
studies
golf
and
plays
at
political
economy
in
serener
moments
i
suffer
ponting
gladly
but
his
boast
that
he
had
done
the
course
at
westward
ho
in
seven
or
seventeen
or
seventy
how
on
earth
should
i
remember
left
me
cold
and
his
crude
economics
interfered
with
my
digestion
strolling
forlornly
down
piccadilly
i
came
face
to
face
with
my
cousin
rosalie
in
a
gown
she
gave
me
a
hasty
nod
and
would
have
passed
on
but
i
arrested
her
her
white
face
was
turned
piteously
upward
and
from
her
expressionless
eyes
flashed
a
glance
of
fear
i
felt
myself
in
a
brutal
mood
why
i
asked
are
you
avoiding
me
as
if
i
were
a
pestilence
she
murmured
that
she
was
not
avoiding
me
but
was
in
a
hurry
i
don
t
believe
it
said
i
people
have
been
telling
you
that
i
am
a
vile
wicked
man
who
does
unspeakable
things
and
like
a
good
little
girl
you
are
afraid
to
talk
to
me
tell
people
the
next
time
you
see
them
with
my
compliments
that
they
are
malevolent
i
lifted
my
hat
and
relieving
rosalie
of
my
terrifying
presence
walked
away
in
dudgeon
i
felt
abominably
and
unreasonably
angry
i
bethought
me
of
my
aunt
jessica
whom
i
held
responsible
for
her
niece
s
behaviour
a
militant
mood
prompted
a
call
after
twenty
minutes
in
a
hansom
i
found
myself
in
her
she
was
alone
the
girls
being
away
on
visits
her
reception
was
glacial
i
expressed
the
hope
that
the
yachting
cruise
had
been
a
pleasant
one
exceedingly
pleasant
snapped
my
aunt
i
trust
dora
is
well
said
i
keeping
from
my
lips
a
smile
that
might
have
hinted
at
the
broken
heart
very
well
thank
as
i
do
not
enjoy
a
staccato
conversation
i
remained
politely
silent
inviting
her
by
my
attitude
to
speak
i
rather
wonder
marcus
she
said
at
last
at
your
referring
to
indeed
may
i
ask
why
may
i
speak
plainly
i
beseech
i
have
heard
of
you
at
etretat
with
your
well
i
asked
said
my
aunt
and
you
have
let
ralph
and
rosalie
know
of
my
summer
holiday
and
given
them
to
understand
that
i
am
a
monster
of
depravity
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
i
have
just
met
rosalie
in
the
street
and
she
shrank
from
me
as
if
i
were
the
reincarnation
of
original
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
her
innocent
mind
you
are
replied
my
aunt
jessica
the
indulgent
smile
wherewith
she
used
to
humour
my
eccentricities
had
gone
and
her
face
was
hard
and
unpitying
i
am
glad
i
have
such
relations
said
i
i
am
a
woman
of
the
world
my
aunt
retorted
but
i
think
that
when
such
things
are
flaunted
in
the
face
of
society
they
become
i
rose
do
evil
by
stealth
as
much
as
you
like
said
i
but
blush
to
find
it
with
a
gesture
my
aunt
assented
to
the
proposition
on
the
other
hand
said
i
heatedly
i
have
been
doing
a
certain
amount
of
good
both
by
stealth
and
openly
and
i
naturally
blush
with
indignation
to
find
it
accounted
i
looked
narrowly
into
my
aunt
s
eyes
and
i
read
in
them
entire
disbelief
in
my
protest
i
swear
if
i
had
proved
my
innocence
beyond
the
shadow
of
doubt
that
woman
would
have
been
grievously
disappointed
said
i
she
shook
hands
frigidly
and
turned
to
ring
the
bell
a
moment
later
i
really
believe
she
was
moved
by
a
kindly
impulse
she
intercepted
me
at
the
door
i
know
you
are
odd
and
quixotic
marcus
she
said
in
a
softer
tone
i
hope
you
will
do
nothing
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
in
a
white
heat
of
unreasonable
rage
i
hope
you
won
t
try
to
repair
things
by
marrying
this
young
to
make
an
honest
woman
of
her
do
you
mean
i
asked
grimly
yes
said
my
aunt
then
suddenly
the
devil
leaped
into
me
and
stirred
all
the
elements
of
unrest
anger
and
longing
together
in
a
cauldron
which
i
suppose
was
my
heart
the
result
was
explosion
i
made
a
step
forward
with
raised
hands
and
my
aunt
recoiled
in
alarm
by
heaven
i
cried
i
would
give
the
soul
out
of
my
body
to
marry
her
and
i
stumbled
out
of
the
house
like
a
blind
man
from
that
moment
of
dazzling
revelation
till
now
i
have
nursed
this
infinite
desire
to
say
that
i
love
carlotta
is
to
express
niagara
in
terms
of
a
fountain
i
crave
her
with
everything
vital
in
heart
and
brain
she
is
an
obsession
the
scent
of
her
hair
is
in
my
nostrils
the
cooing
of
her
voice
murmur
in
my
ears
i
shut
my
eyes
and
feel
the
of
her
lips
on
my
cheek
the
witchery
of
her
movements
dances
before
my
eyes
i
can
not
live
without
her
until
the
house
was
desolate
enough
a
ghostly
shell
of
a
habitation
henceforward
without
her
my
very
life
will
be
void
my
heart
has
been
crying
for
her
these
two
weeks
and
i
knew
it
not
now
i
know
i
could
stand
on
my
balcony
and
lift
up
my
hands
toward
the
south
where
she
abides
and
lift
up
my
voice
and
cry
for
her
passionately
aloud
there
is
no
infernal
foolishness
in
the
world
that
i
could
not
commit
tonight
the
maddest
dingo
dog
if
he
could
appreciate
my
state
of
being
would
learn
points
in
insanity
it
is
two
o
clock
i
must
go
to
sleep
i
take
from
my
shelves
epictetus
who
might
be
expected
to
throw
cold
water
on
the
most
burning
fever
of
the
mind
i
have
not
read
far
before
i
come
across
this
consolatory
apophthegm
the
contest
is
unequal
between
a
charming
girl
and
a
beginner
in
he
is
mocking
me
the
pedagogue
i
throw
his
book
across
the
room
but
he
is
right
i
am
but
a
beginner
in
philosophy
no
armour
wherein
my
reason
can
invest
me
is
of
avail
against
carlotta
i
have
no
strength
to
smite
i
am
helpless
but
by
heaven
am
i
mad
is
not
this
on
the
contrary
the
sanest
hour
of
my
existence
i
have
lived
like
an
automaton
for
forty
years
and
i
suddenly
awake
to
find
myself
a
man
i
don
t
care
whether
i
sleep
or
not
i
feel
gloriously
exultingly
young
i
am
but
twenty
as
i
have
never
lived
i
have
never
grown
old
life
translates
itself
into
music
a
wild
invitation
to
the
waltz
by
some
archangel
weber
i
laugh
out
loud
polyphemus
who
has
been
regarding
me
with
his
one
bantering
eye
from
carlotta
s
corner
on
the
sofa
leaps
to
the
ground
and
grotesquely
curvets
round
the
room
in
a
series
of
impish
hops
heigh
old
boy
do
the
pulsations
of
the
music
throb
in
your
veins
too
come
along
and
let
us
make
a
night
of
it
to
the
devil
with
sleep
we
ll
go
together
down
to
the
cellar
and
find
a
bottle
of
pommery
and
we
will
drink
to
life
and
youth
and
love
and
the
splendour
and
the
joy
thereof
he
utters
a
little
cry
of
delight
and
frisks
around
me
in
the
blackness
of
the
cellar
his
one
eye
gleams
like
a
star
and
he
purrs
unutterable
rapture
my
hand
passed
over
his
back
produces
a
shower
of
sparks
we
return
up
the
silent
stairs
i
carry
a
bottle
of
pommery
and
a
milkjug
for
you
shall
revel
too
polyphemus
and
as
i
have
forgotten
to
bring
a
saucer
you
shall
drink
as
no
cat
has
drunk
before
from
an
old
precious
platter
bearing
the
arms
of
the
estes
of
ferrara
over
which
lucrezia
borgia
laughed
when
the
world
was
young
it
is
a
pity
cats
don
t
drink
champagne
i
would
have
made
you
as
drunk
as
bacchus
we
drink
and
in
the
stillness
the
glouglou
of
his
tongue
forms
a
bass
to
the
elfin
notes
of
the
pommery
in
the
tumbler
ha
twin
purveyors
of
the
milk
of

i
wonder
like
omar
what
you
buy
so
precious
as
the
stuff
you
sell
for
pommery
and
cakes
for
the
little
grenos
i
do
not
like
to
regard
you
as
common
humans
addicted
to
silk
hats
and
umbrellas

the
other
vices
of
respectability

a

scribbled
on
this

bring
her
here
tomorrow
night
but
no
what
is
a
week
it
is
an
eternity
but
winged
with
the
dove
s
iris
it
is
a
mere
moment
besides
i
must
accustom
myself
to
my
youth
i
must
investigate
its
follies
i
must
learn
the
grammar
of
its
wisdom
we
ll
take
counsel
together
polyphemus
how
to
turn
these
chambers
fusty
with
decayed
thought
into
a
bridal
bower
radiant
and
fragrant
with
innumerable
loves
let
us
drink
again
to
her
witchery
it
is
her
breath
itself
distilled
by
the
heavenly

foams
against

lips
i
would
give
the
soul
out
of
my

marry
her
did
i

it
were

buying
her
for
a
farthing

would

the

of

for
a

up
polyphemus
under

his
hind
legs
dangle
he
continues
to
lick
his
chops
and
looks
at
me
sardonically
he
is
stolid
over
his
cups
which
is
somewhat
disappointing
no
matter
he
can
be
shaken
into
enthusiasm

i
have
suffered
all
day
from
a
racking
headache
having
awakened
at
six
o
clock
and
crept
shivering
to
bed
i
realise
that
pommery
and

are
not
at
all
but
mere
commercial
purveyors
of
a
form
of
alcohol
a
quart
of
which
it
is
injudicious
to
imbibe
with
a

welcome
the
good
soul
has
filled
the
house
with
flowers
and
usurping
stenson
s
functions
has
polished
furniture
and
book
backs
and
silver
and
has
hung
fresh
blinds
and
scrubbed
and
scoured
until
i
am
afraid
to
walk
about
or
sit
down
lest
i
should
tarnish
the
spotless
brightness
of
my
surroundings
you
have
forgotten
one
thing
antoinette
i
remarked
satirically
you
have
omitted
to
strew
the
front
steps
with
i
would
cover
them
with
my
body
for
the
dear
angel
to
walk
upon
as
she
entered
said
antoinette
that
would
scarcely
be
i
murmured
antoinette
laughed
and
monsieur
then
he
is
just
as
bad
has
he
not
put
new
curtains
in
the
room
of
mademoiselle
and
a
new
toilette
table
and
a
set
of

no

i
at
a
loss
for
a
better
retort
will
say
whatever
monsieur
it
is
indeed
the
right
of
monsieur
said
antoinette
respectfully
but
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
not
devoid
of
significance
does
the
crafty
old
woman
suspect
perhaps
my
preparations
for
carlotta
s
return
have
been
inordinate
for
they
have
extended
to
the
transformation
of
the
downstairs
into
a
lady

boudoir
i
have
been
busy
this
happy
week
but
what
care
i
it
will
not
be
long
before
i
have
to
say
to
her
antoinette
there
is
going
to
be

must
be

in

chapter
xiv
october
at
paddington
i
came
upon
sebastian
pasquale
lounging
about
the
arrival
platform
as
i
had
not
seen
or
heard
of
him
since
the
end
of
july
i
had
concluded
that
he
was
wandering
as
usual
over
the
globe
he
greeted
me
effusively
holding
out
both
hands
in
his
foreign
fashion
my
dear
old
ordeyne
who
would
have
thought
of
meeting
you
here
what
wind
blows
you
to
paddington
i
expect
carlotta
by
the
plymouth
the
fair
carlotta
and
how
is
she
and
what
is
she
doing
at
plymouth
in
the
middle
of
my
explanation
he
pulled
out
his
watch
by
jove
i
must
get
to
the
next
platform
and
catch
my
train
to
ealing
i
was
just
killing
time
about
the
station
i
like
seeing
a
train
come
in
the
gleam
and
smoke
and
rush
and
whirr
of
the
thing
and
the
sudden
metamorphosis
of
its
sleek
sides
into
mouths
belching
forth
humanity
i
think
of
hades
this
by
the
way
isn
t
a
bad
representation
of
it
the
hades
they
ve
got
a
railway
bridge
now
across
the
styx
and
charon
has
a
gold
band
around
his
cap
and
this
might
be
the
arrival
platform
of
the
damned
you
forget
said
i
that
it
is
the
arrival
platform
of
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
boyishly
well
consider
it
the
golden
gate
terminus
of
the
earth
hades
and
olympus
railway
if
you
like
i
m
off
on
a
branch
line
to
meet
a
beauteous
duchessa
at
ealing
oh
an
authentic
one
i
assure
why
should
i
doubt
it
said
stenson
whom
i
had
brought
to
look
after
carlotta
s
luggage
came
up
and
touched
his
hat
train
just
signalled
pasquale
put
out
his
hand
after
another
glance
at
his
watch
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
wait
to
greet
the
fair
one
i
ll
drop
in
soon
and
pay
my
respects
i
am
only
just
back
in
london
you
know
he
waved
me
farewell
and
hurried
off
the
arrival
of
the
train
the
exuberance
of
carlotta
the
joy
of
having
her
sidle
up
against
me
once
more
in
the
cab
while
she
poured
out
her
story
and
the
subsequent
gaiety
of
the
evening
banished
pasquale
from
my
mind
but
it
is
odd
that
i
should
have
met
him
at
paddington
we
parted
on
the
landing
to
dress
for
dinner
a
moment
afterwards
there
was
a
beating
at
my
door
i
opened
it
to
behold
carlotta
in
a
glow
of
wondering
delight
brandishing
a
brush
in
one
hand
and
the
in
the
other
oh
my
darling
seer
marcous
for
me
all
that
for
me
no
it
is
for
antoinette
said
i
she
laughed
and
pulled
me
by
the
arm
into
her
room
and
shut
the
door
oh
everything
is
beautiful
beautiful
and
i
shall
die
if
i
do
not
kiss
you
must
be
kept
alive
at
all
hazards
i
laughed
and
this
time
i
did
not
reject
her
but
it
was
a
child
around
whom
my
arms
closed
an
inner
flash
accompanied
by
a
spasm
of
pain
revealed
it
and
changed
a
passionate
desire
to
gentleness
there
said
i
after
she
had
released
herself
and
flown
to
open
the
drawers
of
the
new
toilette
table
where
lay
some
odds
and
ends
of
jewelry
i
had
purchased
for
her
you
have
been
saved
from
extinction
the
next
deadly
peril
is
hunger
i
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
she
came
down
to
dinner
in
a
frock
wearing
the
necklace
and
bangle
and
child
that
she
is
in
her
hand
she
carried
the
mirror
i
believe
she
has
taken
it
to
bed
with
her
as
a
does
its
toy
she
certainly
kept
it
by
her
all
the
evening
and
admired
herself
therein
unashamedly
like
the
traditional
lady
from
the
sea
once
desiring
to
show
me
the
ravishing
beauty
of
a
turquoise
pendant
she
bent
her
neck
forward
as
i
sat
so
as
to
come
within
reach
of
my
nearsighted
eyes
it
is
a
superstition
of
hers
that
i
am
nearly
blind
without
my
glasses
and
quite
naturally
slid
onto
my
knee
she
has
the
warm
russet
complexion
that
suits
her
heavy
bronze
hair
and
there
is
a
glow
beneath
the
satin
of
her
neck
and
arms
and
she
is
fragrant
i
recognise
it
now
of
hyacinths
the
world
can
hold
nothing
more
alluring
to
the
senses
of
man
my
fingers
that
held
the
turquoise
trembled
as
they
chanced
to
touch
her
but
she
was
all
unconcerned
nay
further
she
gazed
into
the
mirror
it
makes
me
look
so
white
oh
there
was
a
girl
at
bude
who
had
a
gold
locket
and
it
lay
upon
her
bones
you
could
count
them
i
am
glad
i
have
no
bones
i
am
quite
soft
she
clasped
my
fingers
and
pressed
their
tips
into
the
firm
young
flesh
below
her
throat
yes
said
i
with
some
huskiness
in
my
voice
your
turquoise
can
sleep
there
very
pleasantly
see
i
will
kiss
it
to
bring
you
good
she
cooed
with
pleasure
i
don
t
think
any
one
kissed
the
locket
of
the
girl
at
bude
she
was
too
thin
and
too
old
she
must
have
been
thirty
now
she
added
lifting
up
the
locket
you
will
kiss
the
place
too
where
it
is
to
i
looked
for
a
moment
into
her
eyes
seeing
me
hesitate
they
grew
pathetic
she
said
reproachfully
i
know
i
am
a
fool
i
know
that
pasquale
would
have
hurled
his
sarcasms
at
me
i
know
that
the
whole
of
her
deliciousness
was
mine
for
the
taking
mine
for
ever
and
ever
if
i
had
loved
her
less
passionately
i
would
have
kissed
her
young
throat
lightly
with
a
jest
but
to
have
kissed
her
thus
with
such
longing
as
mine
behind
my
lips
would
have
been
an
outrage
i
lifted
her
to
her
feet
and
rose
and
turned
away
laughing
unsteadily
no
my
dear
said
i
that
would
be
the
bathos
of
the
word
made
me
laugh
louder
carlotta
aware
that
a
joke
was
in
the
air
joined
in
my
mirth
and
her
laughter
rang
fresh
what
is
the
suitable
way
of
kissing
i
took
her
hand
and
saluted
it
in
an
eighteenth
century
manner
this
said
i
said
carlotta
that
is
so
she
caught
up
polyphemus
and
buried
her
face
in
his
fur
that
s
the
way
i
should
like
to
be
the
man
you
love
my
dear
said
i
will
doubtless
do
she
made
a
little
grimace
oh
then
i
shall
have
to
wait
such
a
long
you
needn
t
said
i
taking
her
hands
again
and
speaking
very
seriously
can
t
you
learn
to
love
a
man
give
him
your
whole
heart
and
all
your
best
and
sweetest
thoughts
i
would
marry
any
nice
man
if
you
gave
me
to
him
she
answered
it
would
not
matter
who
he
was
anyone
would
do
why
of
course
said
carlotta
and
any
one
wanting
to
marry
you
could
kiss
you
as
you
kissed
he
would
have
to
be
nice
not
like
i
turned
away
with
a
sigh
and
lit
a
cigarette
while
carlotta
curled
herself
up
on
the
sofa
and
inspected
her
face
and
necklace
in
the
silver
mirror
in
a
moment
she
was
talking
to
the
cat
who
had
jumped
on
her
lap
and
with
arched
back
was
rubbing
himself
against
her
soon
the
touch
of
sadness
was
lost
in
the
happy
sight
of
her
and
the
happy
thought
that
my
house
was
no
longer
left
to
me
desolate
we
laughed
away
the
evening
but
now
sitting
alone
i
feel
empty
of
soul
like
a
man
stricken
with
fierce
hunger
who
expecting
food
in
a
certain
place
finds
nothing
but
a
few
delicate
cakes
that
mock
his
craving
october
a
week
has
passed
i
have
spent
it
chiefly
in
trying
to
win
her
love
is
she
after
all
only
a
child
and
is
this
love
of
mine
but
a
monstrous
passion
what
is
to
be
done
life
is
beginning
to
be
a
torture
if
i
send
her
away
i
shall
eat
my
heart
out
if
she
stays
fuel
is
but
added
to
the
fire
her
caressing
ways
will
drive
me
mad
to
repulse
her
were
brutal
she
loves
to
be
fondled
she
can
scarcely
speak
to
me
without
touching
me
leaning
over
me
thus
filling
me
with
the
sense
of
her
she
treats
me
with
an
affectionate
child
s
innocence
as
if
i
were
sexless
my
happiest
time
with
her
is
spent
in
public
places
restaurants
and
theatres
where
her
unclouded
pleasure
is
reflected
in
my
heart
i
am
letting
her
take
music
lessons
with
herr
stuer
who
lives
close
by
in
the
avenue
road
perhaps
music
may
help
in
her
development
october
to
please
her
i
am
accustoming
myself
to
this
life
which
once
i
despised
so
cordially
pasquale
has
joined
us
two
or
three
times
last
night
he
gave
a
dinner
in
carlotta
s
honour
at
the
continental
the
ladies
of
the
party
have
asked
her
to
go
to
see
them
she
must
have
some
society
i
suppose
and
i
must
go
with
her
they
belong
to
the
half
smart
set
eager
to
conceal
beneath
a
show
of
raffishness
their
plentiful
lack
of
intellect
and
their
fundamental
bourgeois
respectability
in
spite
of
pasquale
s
brilliance
and
carlotta
s
rapturous
enjoyment
i
sat
mumchance
and
depressed
out
of
my
element
my
work
is
at
a
standstill
and
carlotta
is
my
life
i
fear
i
am
deteriorating
on
judith
whom
i
have
seen
once
or
twice
since
carlotta
s
return
i
called
this
afternoon
she
is
unhappy
although
i
have
not
confessed
to
my
thraldom
her
woman
s
wit
i
feel
sure
has
penetrated
to
the
heart
of
my
mystery
there
has
been
no
deep
emotion
in
our
intercourse
its
foundation
has
been
real
friendship
sweetened
with
pleasant
sentimentality
and
yet
jealousy
of
carlotta
consumes
her
her
is
deeply
wounded
she
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
had
played
the
part
of
a
brute
but
o
judith
my
dear
i
have
only
been
a
man
the
same
thing
i
fancy
i
hear
her
answer
but
no
i
have
never
loved
a
woman
my
dear
in
all
my
life
before
and
as
i
made
no
secret
of
it
i
am
guiltless
of
anything
like
betrayal
in
due
season
i
will
tell
you
frankly
of
the
new
love
but
how
can
i
tell
you
now
how
could
i
tell
any
human
being
i
imagine
myself
as
panurge
taking
counsel
with
a
pantagruelian
friend
i
am
in
love
with
carlotta
and
desire
to
marry
then
marry
her
says
pantagruel
but
she
does
not
love
then
don
t
marry
says
pantagruel
but
nay
urges
poor
panurge
she
would
marry
me
according
to
any
rite
civil
or
ecclesiastical
doncques
de
par
dieu
replies
pantagruel
but
i
should
be
a
villain
to
take
advantage
of
her
innocence
and
then
don
t
but
i
can
t
live
without
her
says
panurge
desperately
i
am
as
a
man
bewitched
if
i
don
t
marry
her
i
shall
waste
away
with
then
marry
her
in
god
s
name
says
pantagruel
and
i
am
no
wiser
by
his
counsel
and
i
have
paraded
the
complication
of
my
folly
before
mocking
eyes
october
i
perceive
that
the
young
man
of
the
idiot
metaphor
was
gifted
with
piercing
acumen
beneath
the
jaquesian
melancholy
of
my
temperament
he
diagnosed
the
potentiality
of
canine
rabidness
no
rational
being
is
afflicted
with
this
grotesque
concentration
of
idea
this
fierce
hot
fury
waxing
in
intensity
day
by
day
i
must
consult
a
brain
specialist
october
i
went
to
judith
this
afternoon
more
to
prove
the
loyalty
of
my
friendship
than
to
seek
comfort
from
her
society
over
tea
we
discussed
the
weather
and
books
and
her
statistical
work
it
was
dull
but
unembarrassing
the
grey
twilight
crept
into
the
room
and
there
was
a
pause
in
our
talk
she
broke
it
by
asking
without
looking
at
me
when
are
we
to
have
an
evening
together
again
whenever
you
like
my
dear
i
am
afraid
not
said
i
are
you
doing
anything
so
very
particular
i
have
arranged
to
take
carlotta
to
the
oh
said
judith
shortly
and
i
was
left
uncomfortable
for
another
spell
of
silence
it
would
be
very
kind
marcus
to
ask
me
to
accompany
you
she
said
at
last
carlotta
and
myself
why
not
my
question
arose
from
the
stupidity
of
surprise
said
i
i
thought
you
disliked
by
no
means
i
should
be
glad
to
make
her
further
acquaintance
any
one
that
interests
you
must
also
be
interesting
to
in
that
case
said
i
your
coming
will
give
us
both
the
greatest
possible
i
haven
t
had
a
merry
evening
for
ever
so
we
will
dine
somewhere
first
and
have
supper
afterwards
the
whole
gamut
of
merriment
toute
la
lyre
and
you
shall
have
i
added
some
of
your
favourite
veuve
it
will
be
charming
said
judith
politely
in
fact
politeness
has
been
the
dominant
note
of
her
attitude
a
sober
restraint
of
manner
such
as
she
would
adopt
when
rather
tired
towards
an
ordinary
acquaintance
has
she
reconciled
herself
to
the
inevitable
and
taken
this
empire
frolic
as
a
graceful
method
of
showing
it
i
should
like
to
believe
so
but
the
course
is
scarcely
consistent
with
that
motor
of
illogic
which
she
is
pleased
to
call
her
temperament
i
am
puzzled
her
smile
as
we
parted
sent
a
chill
through
me
being
the
smile
of
a
mask
instead
of
a
woman
s
face
and
it
was
not
the
face
of
judith
i
don
t
anticipate
much
merriment
tomorrow
evening
at
carlotta
s
suggestion
i
have
sent
a
line
to
pasquale
to
ask
him
to
join
us
his
gay
wit
will
lend
to
the
entertainment
a
specious
air
of
revelry
which
carlotta
will
take
as
genuine
i
have
often
thought
lately
of
the
hopeless
passion
of
alfonso
the
magnanimous
of
naples
as
set
forth
by
pope
pius
ii
in
his
commentaries
for
i
am
beginning
to
take
a
morbid
interest
in
the
unhappy
love
affairs
of
other
men
and
to
institute
comparisons
if
they
have
lived
through
the
torment
why
should
not
i
but
alfonso
sighed
for
lucrezia
d
alagna
a
beautiful
chaste
statue
of
ice
who
loved
him
whereas
i
crave
the
thing
that
is
mine
for
the
taking
but
no
more
loves
me
than
she
loves
the
policeman
who
salutes
her
on
his
beat
i
can
not
take
her
something
stronger
than
my
passion
opposes
an
adamantine
barrier
i
love
her
with
my
soul
as
well
as
with
my
body
and
my
soul
cries
out
for
the
soul
that
the
almighty
forgot
when
endowing
her
with
entity
this
evening
a
letter
from
the
editor
of
the
quarterly
review
it
would
give
him
great
pleasure
if
i
would
contribute
a
renaissance
article
taking
as
my
text
a
german
a
russian
and
an
english
attempt
to
whitewash
the
borgia
family
six
months
ago
the
compliment
would
have
filled
me
with
gratification
what
to
me
are
the
whitewashed
borgias
or
the
solemn
denizens
of
the
athenaeum
who
will
slumber
over
my
account
of
the
blameless
poisonings
of
this
amiable
family
they
are
vanity
and
vexation
of
a
spirit
already
sore
at
ease
as
i
write
the
door
creaks
i
look
up
behold
carlotta
in
hastily
slipped
on
open
in
front
her
hair
streaming
loose
to
her
waist
her
bare
feet
flashing
pink
beneath
her
oh
seer
marcous
darling
i
am
so
frightened
she
ran
forward
and
caught
the
lappels
of
my
coat
as
i
rose
from
my
chair
what
is
the
matter
there
is
a
mouse
in
my
polyphemus
saved
the
situation
by
jumping
from
the
sofa
and
rubbing
his
back
against
her
feet
take
the
cat
and
tell
him
to
kill
it
said
i
and
go
back
to
bed
at
i
must
have
spoken
roughly
for
she
regarded
me
with
her
great
eyes
full
of
innocent
reproach
there
take
up
the
cat
and
go
i
repeated
you
mustn
t
come
down
here
looking
like
i
thought
i
looked
very
pretty
said
carlotta
moving
a
step
nearer
i
sat
down
at
my
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
my
paper
you
are
like
a
houri
that
has
been
sent
away
from
paradise
for
misbehaviour
i
said
she
laughed
her
curious
cooing
laugh
seer
marcous
is
shocked
and
she
ran
away
rubbing
polyphemus
s
nose
against
her
face
i
wonder
if
the
devil
having
grown
infirm
is
mixing
up
his
centuries
and
mistaking
me
for
a
mediaeval
saint
paphnutius
for
instance
who
was
visited
by
such
a
seductress
what
is
the
legend
to
get
rid
of
her
he
burns
off
his
hand
whereupon
she
falls
dead
he
prays
and
she
returns
to
life
and
becomes
a
nun
no
messer
diavolo
i
am
not
paphnutius
i
will
not
maim
myself
nor
do
i
want
carlotta
to
fall
dead
and
i
can
not
pray
and
effect
a
pietistic
resurrection
i
am
simply
a
fool
of
a
modern
man
tempted
out
of
his
wits
who
scarce
knows
what
it
is
that
he
speaks
or
writes
i
am
not
superstitious
but
i
feel
myself
on
the
brink
of
some
disaster
i
walk
restlessly
about
the
room
on
the
are
three
photographs
in
silver
frames
judith
carlotta
pasquale
that
which
is
of
mockery
in
the
spirit
of
each
seems
to
be
hovering
round
the
portraits
and
to
be
making
sport
of
me
an
autumn
gale
is
howling
among
the
trees
outside
like
a
legion
of
lost
souls
listen
messer
diavolo
himself
might
be
riding
by
with
a
whoop
of
derision
chapter
xv
october
i
knew
something
would
happen
messer
diavolo
does
not
ride
whooping
to
no
purpose
by
the
windows
of
people
whom
he
desires
to
torment
nor
does
he
inspire
photographs
for
nothing
with
an
active
spirit
of
mockery
we
dined
at
the
trocadero
carlotta
loves
the
band
and
the
buzz
of
babel
and
the
heavy
scents
and
the
clatter
and
the
tumult
and
the
glare
of
light
otherwise
i
should
have
chosen
a
discreeter
hostelry
where
the
footfalls
of
the
were
noiseless
and
the
walls
in
quiet
shadow
where
there
was
nothing
but
the
mellow
talk
of
friends
to
distract
the
mind
from
the
consideration
of
exquisite
flavours
but
in
these
palaces
of
clashing
splendour
the
stunned
brain
fails
to
receive
impressions
from
the
glossopharyngeal
nerve
and
one
eats
unthinkingly
like
a
dog
but
this
matters
little
to
carlotta
perhaps
when
i
was
nineteen
it
mattered
little
to
me
and
also
it
mattered
little
for
my
mind
was
preoccupied
and
a
dinner
with
lucullus
would
have
been
savourless
if
the
psalmist
cried
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
what
cry
had
he
at
the
back
of
his
head
to
utter
concerning
woman
did
he
leave
her
to
be
implicitly
dealt
with
by
charles
darwin
in
his
theory
of
sexual
selection
or
did
he
in
the
good
old
oriental
way
regard
her
as
unimportant
in
the
eyes
of
the
deity
if
the
latter
he
was
a
purblind
prophet
and
missed
the
very
fount
of
human
tears
when
i
looked
at
judith
i
was
smitten
with
a
great
pain
she
had
not
looked
so
young
so
fresh
so
fragilely
fair
for
many
months
she
wore
a
dress
of
blue
that
deepened
the
violet
of
her
eyes
in
the
mass
of
flax
hued
that
is
her
hair
a
blue
argus
butterfly
completed
the
chord
of
colour
there
was
the
faintest
tinge
of
pink
in
her
cheek
applied
with
delicate
art
her
dress
seemed
made
of
unsubstantial
dream
stuff
i
believe
they
call
it
chiffon
and
it
covered
her
bosom
and
arms
like
the
spray
of
a
fairy
sea
she
had
the
air
of
an
impalpable
undine
a
creation
of
and
an
exquisite
suggestion
of
the
ethereal
which
floated
beauty
as
it
were
into
her
face
i
know
little
of
women
save
what
these
past
few
grievous
months
have
taught
me
but
i
know
that
hours
of
anxious
thought
and
desperate
hope
lay
behind
this
effect
of
fragile
loveliness
the
wit
of
woman
could
not
have
rendered
a
woman
s
body
a
greater
contrast
to
that
of
her
rival
and
with
infinite
subtlety
she
had
imbued
the
contrast
with
the
deeper
significance
of
rare
and
spiritual
things
i
know
this
was
so
i
know
it
was
a
challenge
a
defiance
an
ordeal
by
combat
and
the
knowledge
hurt
me
so
that
i
felt
like
a
dathan
or
abiram
who
had
laid
hand
on
the
ark
of
the
covenant
for
the
soul
of
a
woman
by
heaven
is
a
holy
thing
and
i
wished
that
the
earth
could
open
and
swallow
me
up
we
sat
down
to
table
in
the
middle
of
the
great
room
a
quiet
corner
on
the
balcony
away
from
the
band
is
not
to
carlotta
s
taste
like
any
conventional
party
of
four
and
at
first
talked
of
indifferent
matters
conciergerie
in
the
terror
always
began
with
a
discussion
of
the
latest
cure
for
megrims
or
the
most
fashionable
cut
of
a
panier
presently
pasquale
who
had
been
talking
travel
with
judith
appealed
to
me
what
year
was
it
ordeyne
that
i
came
home
from
abyssinia
i
forget
said
i
i
only
remember
you
presenting
me
with
that
hideous
thing
hanging
in
my
passage
which
you
called
a
gage
d
amour
smiled
judith
pasquale
laughed
and
twirled
his
swaggering
moustache
i
did
get
it
from
a
damsel
and
that
is
why
i
called
it
a
dulcimer
but
she
didn
t
sing
of
mount
abora
i
wish
i
could
remember
the
i
think
it
was
in
said
judith
quietly
pasquale
who
had
been
completely
unaware
of
judith
s
existence
until
half
an
hour
before
could
not
repress
a
stare
of
polite
surprise
i
believe
you
are
right
in
fact
you
are
but
how
can
you
tell
through
the
kindness
of
sir
marcus
replied
judith
graciously
you
are
a
very
old
acquaintance
i
could
write
you
a
nice
little
obituary
notice
with
all
the
adventures
well
i
will
not
say
complete
but
with
all
the
dates
accurate
i
assure
you
i
have
a
head
for
that
sort
of
yes
i
cried
desiring
to
turn
the
conversation
don
t
tell
mainwaring
anything
you
wish
forgotten
facts
are
her
passion
she
writes
wonderful
articles
full
of
figures
that
make
your
head
spin
and
publishes
them
in
the
popular
magazines
over
the
signature
of
willoughby
the
statistician
allow
me
to
present
to
you
a
statistical
but
pasquale
s
subtle
italian
brain
was
paying
but
half
attention
to
me
i
could
read
his
inferences
from
judith
s
observations
and
i
could
tell
what
she
wanted
him
to
infer
i
seem
to
have
worn
my
sensory
system
outside
instead
of
inside
my
skin
this
evening
ordeyne
said
he
you
are
a
pig
and
the
of
pigs
foul
cried
carlotta
seizing
on
an
intelligible
point
of
the
conversation
why
didn
t
you
present
me
to
mainwaring
in
i
declare
i
have
thought
myself
allied
to
that
man
for
twenty
years
in
bonds
of
the
most
intimate
friendship
and
he
has
never
so
much
as
mentioned
you
to
seer
marcous
says
that
pasquale
is
a
bad
lot
remarked
carlotta
with
an
air
of
sapience
after
a
sip
of
orangeade
a
revolting
beverage
which
she
loves
to
drink
at
her
meals
pasquale
threw
back
his
handsome
head
and
laughed
again
like
the
chartered
libertine
he
is
and
judith
smiled
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
said
i
apologetically
in
all
seriousness
said
pasquale
to
judith
i
had
no
idea
that
any
one
was
such
a
close
friend
of
ordeyne
judith
turned
to
me
with
a
graceful
gesture
of
her
shoulders
i
think
we
have
been
close
friends
marcus
oh
broke
in
carlotta
mrs
mainwaring
has
the
picture
of
seer
marcous
in
her
bedroom
and
there
is
the
picture
of
mainwaring
in
our
you
have
not
seen
it
but
yes
you
have
not
recognised
it
pasquale
mainwaring
is
so
pretty
tonight
much
prettier
than
the
photograph
yes
you
are
so
pretty
i
would
like
to
put
you
on
the
as
an
ornament
instead
of
the
may
i
be
allowed
to
endorse
carlotta
s
sentiment
of
appreciation
i
said
with
a
view
to
covering
her
indiscretion
for
i
saw
a
flash
of
conjecture
in
pasquale
s
eyes
and
a
sudden
spot
of
real
red
in
judith
s
cheeks
she
had
evidently
desired
to
suggest
an
old
claim
on
my
regard
but
to
have
it
based
on
such
intimate
details
as
the
enshrining
of
my
photograph
was
not
to
her
fancy
i
am
vastly
beholden
to
you
both
said
judith
who
has
a
graceful
way
of
receiving
compliments
but
turning
to
pasquale
we
have
travelled
far
from
to
sir
marcus
s
suppose
we
stay
there
is
you
and
me
and
mainwaring
said
the
literal
carlotta
and
i
am
the
big
one
in
the
middle
it
was
made
big
big
she
added
extending
her
arms
in
her
exaggerating
way
i
was
wearing
this
mr
pasquale
and
i
will
have
to
enlarge
our
frames
marcus
said
judith
or
we
shall
be
jealous
we
shall
have
to
make
common
cause
we
will
declare
an
inoffensive
alliance
laughed
pasquale
offensive
if
you
like
said
judith
it
may
have
been
some
effect
of
the
glitter
of
lights
but
i
vow
i
saw
a
swift
interchange
of
glances
pasquale
immediately
turned
to
carlotta
with
a
jesting
remark
and
judith
engaged
me
in
conversation
on
our
old
days
in
rome
suddenly
she
swerved
from
the
topic
and
leaning
forward
indicated
our
companions
with
an
imperceptible
motion
of
her
head
don
t
you
think
she
said
in
a
low
voice
they
are
a
pair
both
young
and
picturesque
it
would
solve
many
i
glanced
round
carlotta
elbow
on
the
table
and
chin
in
hand
was
looking
deep
into
pasquale
s
eyes
just
as
she
has
looked
into
mine
her
lips
had
the
pout
provocative
of
kisses
do
and
i
will
love
you
i
heard
her
say
oh
those
those
melting
eyes
those
lips
oh
the
horrible
fool
passion
that
burns
out
my
soul
and
brain
and
reduces
me
to
rave
like
a
lovelorn
early
victorian
tailor
which
was
worse
i
know
not
the
spasm
of
jealousy
or
the
spasm
of
that
followed
it
at
that
moment
the
music
ceased
suddenly
on
a
loud
crashing
chord
the
moment
seemed
to
be
magnetic
to
all
but
carlotta
who
was
enjoying
herself
prodigiously
our
three
personalities
appeared
to
vibrate
rudely
one
against
the
other
i
was
conscious
that
judith
read
me
that
pasquale
read
judith
that
again
something
telegraphic
passed
between
them
the
waiter
offered
me
partridge
pasquale
quickly
turned
from
carlotta
to
his
neighbour
i
think
we
ought
to
drink
faust
s
health
don
t
you
i
started
had
i
not
myself
traced
the
analogy
faust
queried
judith
at
a
loss
our
friend
faust
opposite
me
said
pasquale
raising
his
champagne
glass
hasn
t
he
been
transformed
from
the
lean
and
elderly
bookworm
into
the
gay
young
gallant
about
the
town
once
one
could
scarcely
drag
him
from
his
cell
to
the
quietest
of
dinners
and
now
has
he
told
you
of
his
dissipations
this
past
month
mainwaring
judith
smiled
have
you
been
mephistopheles
what
is
mephistopheles
asked
carlotta
the
devil
said
pasquale
who
made
sir
marcus
young
oh
that
s
me
cried
carlotta
clapping
her
hands
he
does
not
read
in
big
books
any
longer
oh
i
was
so
frightened
when
i
first
i
must
say
she
hid
her
terrors
pretty
effectually
he
was
so
wise
and
always
reading
and
writing
and
i
thought
he
was
fifty
and
now
he
is
not
wise
at
all
and
he
said
two
three
days
ago
i
had
made
him
if
you
go
on
at
the
rate
you
have
begun
my
dear
judith
remarked
in
her
most
charming
manner
in
another
year
you
will
have
brought
him
down
to
long
clothes
and
a
carlotta
thought
this
very
funny
and
laughed
joyously
i
laughed
too
out
of
courtesy
at
judith
s
bitter
sarcasm
and
turned
the
conversation
but
pasquale
was
not
to
be
baulked
of
his
toast
here
s
to
our
dear
friend
faust
may
he
grow
younger
and
younger
every
we
clinked
glasses
judith
sighed
when
the
performance
was
concluded
that
is
one
of
the
many
advantages
of
being
a
man
if
you
do
sell
your
soul
to
the
devil
you
can
see
that
you
get
proper
payment
a
woman
is
paid
in
promissory
notes
which
are
dishonoured
when
they
fall
i
contested
the
proposition
the
irony
of
this
peculiarly
painful
revel
lay
in
the
air
of
gaiety
it
seemed
necessary
to
maintain
a
miserable
business
is
civilisation
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
woman
getting
youth
out
of
such
a
bargain
she
retorted
with
some
vehemence
as
women
systematically
underpay
cabmen
said
i
so
do
they
try
to
underpay
the
devil
and
he
is
one
too
many
for
i
am
afraid
said
pasquale
that
the
old
days
of
shrewd
bargains
are
over
there
is
a
glut
in
the
and
they
only
fetch
the
price
of
old
he
is
talking
foolish
things
that
i
do
not
understand
said
carlotta
putting
her
hand
on
my
arm
it
is
called
sham
cynicism
my
dear
said
i
and
we
all
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
what
do
you
like
best
to
talk
about
judith
asked
sweetly
myself
and
so
does
everybody
replied
carlotta
we
laughed
and
for
a
time
talk
ceased
to
be
allusive
but
later
over
our
coffee
while
the
band
was
playing
loudly
some
new
american
march
and
carlotta
and
pasquale
were
laughing
together
judith
drew
near
me
you
did
not
answer
my
question
about
those
two
my
fingers
trembled
as
i
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
he
is
not
a
man
to
whom
any
woman
s
destiny
should
be
and
is
she
a
woman
on
whom
a
man
should
stake
his
life
s
happiness
god
knows
said
i
setting
my
teeth
it
was
not
an
enjoyable
i
longed
for
the
evening
to
be
over
to
have
carlotta
safe
back
with
me
at
home
i
felt
a
curious
dread
of
the
empire
we
arrived
there
towards
the
end
of
the
first
ballet
carlotta
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
her
seat
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
front
of
the
box
and
surrendered
her
senses
to
the
stage
pasquale
talked
to
judith
wishing
for
a
few
moments
alone
i
left
the
box
and
sauntered
moodily
along
the
promenade
behind
the
first
circle
the
occupants
were
either
leaning
over
the
partitions
and
watching
the
spectacle
or
sitting
with
drink
before
them
at
the
little
marble
tables
at
the
back
the
gaudy
gilded
and
theatre
seemed
to
be
unreal
the
stage
but
a
phantom
cloud
effect
i
wondered
why
i
a
creature
from
the
concrete
world
was
there
i
had
an
insane
impulse
to
fly
from
it
all
to
go
out
into
the
streets
and
wander
wander
for
ever
away
from
the
world
i
was
walking
along
the
promenade
lost
in
this
lunacy
when
i
stumbled
against
a
and
the
shock
brought
me
to
my
senses
it
was
an
elderly
obese
oriental
wearing
a
red
fez
he
had
a
long
nose
and
small
crafty
eyes
and
was
deeply
pitted
with
smallpox
i
made
profuse
apologies
and
he
accepted
them
with
suavity
it
then
occurring
to
me
that
i
was
he
having
in
a
discourteous
and
abjectly
absurd
manner
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
box
i
drew
a
chair
to
judith
s
side
you
are
giving
me
a
captivating
evening
she
said
with
a
smile
whom
are
you
captivating
i
asked
idly
jesting
pasquale
you
are
cruel
whispered
judith
with
a
flicker
of
her
eyelids
i
flushed
ashamed
not
having
weighed
the
significance
of
my
words
all
i
could
say
was
i
beg
your
pardon
whereat
judith
laughed
mirthlessly
i
relapsed
into
silence
turn
followed
turn
on
the
stage
while
the
curtain
was
lowered
carlotta
sank
back
with
a
little
sigh
of
enjoyment
and
nodded
brightly
at
me
do
you
remember
she
said
turning
to
me
at
a
fresh
fall
of
the
curtain
when
you
brought
me
first
i
said
i
should
like
to
live
here
wasn
t
i
silly
she
turned
again
then
suddenly
rose
to
her
feet
and
staggered
back
to
the
back
of
the
box
pointing
outward
with
an
expression
of
wild
terror
on
her
face
hamdi
he
s
down
there
he
saw
i
sprang
to
her
assistance
and
put
my
arm
around
her
nonsense
dear
said
i
but
pasquale
looking
around
the
house
cried
by
jove
she
s
right
i
would
recognise
the
old
villain
a
thousand
years
hence
in
tartarus
there
he
i
left
carlotta
and
the
first
person
my
eyes
rested
upon
in
the
stalls
was
my
obese
but
suave
oriental
regarding
the
box
with
an
impassive
countenance
that
s
hamdi
effendi
all
right
said
pasquale
carlotta
clutched
my
arms
as
i
joined
her
at
the
back
of
the
box
oh
take
me
away
seer
marcous
take
me
away
she
moaned
piteously
my
poor
child
was
white
and
shaken
with
fear
i
again
put
my
arm
round
her
no
harm
can
happen
to
you
dear
i
said
soothingly
oh
darling
seer
marcous
take
me
home
cried
carlotta
very
well
said
i
helped
her
on
with
her
wrap
and
apologising
to
the
two
others
begged
them
to
remain
we
ll
all
go
together
said
judith
quietly
and
form
a
laughed
pasquale
carlotta
clinging
to
my
arm
we
left
the
box
and
slipped
through
the
promenade
and
down
the
stairs
hamdi
effendi
having
anticipated
our
intention
cut
off
our
retreat
in
the
vestibule
carlotta
shrank
nearer
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
but
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
a
few
words
with
you
about
this
young
lady
said
he
in
the
urbanest
manner
and
the
most
execrable
french
i
hardly
see
the
necessity
said
i
pardon
me
but
this
young
lady
is
a
turkish
subject
and
my
daughter
my
name
is
hamdi
effendi
prefect
of
police
at
aleppo
and
my
address
in
london
is
the
hotel
i
am
charmed
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
i
i
have
often
heard
of
you
from
mademoiselle
but
i
believe
both
her
father
and
mother
were
english
so
she
is
neither
your
daughter
nor
a
turkish
ah
that
we
will
see
rejoined
the
polite
oriental
he
addressed
some
words
rapidly
in
turkish
to
carlotta
who
shudderingly
replied
in
the
same
language
mademoiselle
unfortunately
does
not
consent
to
accompany
me
he
interpreted
with
a
smile
so
i
am
afraid
i
will
have
to
take
her
back
without
her
if
you
do
hamdi
effendi
said
pasquale
in
a
light
tone
of
conversation
but
with
the
ugliest
snarl
of
the
lips
that
i
have
ever
beheld
i
shall
most
certainly
kill
hamdi
turned
to
him
with
a
polite
bow
ah
it
is
monsieur
pasquale
i
thought
i
recognised
you
have
every
reason
to
do
so
said
pasquale
i
saved
you
from
you
accepted
a
for
heaven
s
sake
cried
judith
go
on
speaking
in
low
voices
or
we
shall
have
a
scene
one
or
two
idlers
hung
near
with
an
air
of
curiosity
and
the
huge
beuniformed
commissionaire
watched
us
with
an
uncertain
eye
i
kept
a
tight
hold
of
carlotta
and
drew
her
more
behind
the
screen
of
a
palm
near
which
we
happened
to
stand
madame
is
right
said
hamdi
we
can
discuss
this
little
affair
like
then
in
the
most
gentlemanly
way
in
the
world
said
pasquale
i
swear
to
you
that
if
you
touch
this
young
lady
i
will
kill
it
appears
to
be
monsieur
said
the
obese
turk
with
a
graceful
wave
of
the
hand
in
my
direction
and
not
you
who
has
robbed
my
home
of
its
treasure
unless
he
added
and
i
shall
always
remember
the
hideous
leer
of
that
and
pitted
face
unless
monsieur
has
relieved
you
of
your
for
a
moment
i
was
speechless
pasquale
put
himself
in
front
of
me
steady
on
sir
said
i
i
found
this
young
lady
destitute
in
the
streets
of
london
she
is
my
wife
and
therefore
a
british
subject
so
you
can
take
yourself
and
your
infamous
insinuations
to
the
devil
and
the
quicker
the
or
there
ll
be
two
of
us
engaged
in
the
killing
said
pasquale
hamdi
again
exchanged
a
few
sentences
in
turkish
with
carlotta
and
then
smiled
upon
us
with
the
same
unruffled
suavity
au
revoir
mesdames
et
with
a
courteous
salute
he
shuffled
back
towards
the
the
tension
over
carlotta
broke
from
me
and
clutched
pasquale
by
the
arm
oh
kill
him
kill
him
kill
him
she
cried
in
a
passionate
whisper
he
freed
himself
gently
and
took
out
a
cigarette
case
scarcely
necessary
he
ll
soon
and
turning
to
me
he
added
not
a
sound
organ
in
his
body
besides
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
any
murdering
to
be
done
it
s
the
business
of
sir
there
is
going
to
be
no
murdering
said
i
profoundly
disgusted
and
don
t
talk
in
that
revolting
way
about
the
wretched
man
i
regained
possession
of
carlotta
who
seeing
that
i
was
angry
cast
a
scared
glance
at
me
and
became
docile
as
suddenly
as
she
had
grown
passionate
i
turned
to
judith
will
you
ever
forgive
me
i
began
but
the
sight
of
her
face
froze
me
it
was
white
and
hard
and
haggard
and
the
lips
were
drawn
into
a
thin
line
and
the
delicate
colour
she
had
put
upon
her
cheeks
stood
out
in
ghastly
contrast
her
dress
like
the
foam
of
a
summer
sea
mocked
the
winter
in
her
face
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
she
said
smiling
icily
i
came
for
a
variety
entertainment
and
i
have
not
been
disappointed
perhaps
pasquale
will
be
so
kind
as
to
put
me
into
a
i
will
drive
you
home
if
you
will
allow
me
said
pasquale
we
separated
shaking
hands
as
if
nothing
had
happened
as
perfunctorily
as
if
we
had
been
the
most
distant
of
acquaintances
on
our
way
back
we
spoke
very
little
carlotta
nestled
close
against
me
seeking
the
shelter
of
my
arm
she
cried
i
don
t
know
why
but
it
seemed
to
afford
comfort
i
kissed
her
lips
and
her
hair
at
home
i
drew
the
sofa
near
the
fire
it
has
been
a
raw
night
and
she
feels
the
cold
like
a
tropical
plant
and
sat
down
by
her
side
did
you
hear
what
i
said
to
hamdi
effendi
that
you
were
my
wife
but
that
was
only
a
lie
she
answered
in
her
plain
idiom
my
petting
and
soothing
together
with
the
sense
of
home
security
and
a
cup
of
french
chocolate
prepared
by
antoinette
who
astonished
at
our
early
return
and
seeing
her
darling
in
distress
had
hastened
to
provide
culinary
consolation
had
restored
her
wonted
serenity
of
demeanour
polyphemus
also
purred
reassuringly
upon
her
lap
it
was
a
lie
this
evening
said
i
but
in
a
few
days
i
hope
it
will
be
you
are
going
to
marry
me
she
asked
suddenly
sitting
erect
and
looking
at
me
rather
bewildered
if
you
will
have
me
i
will
do
what
seer
marcous
tells
me
she
answered
will
you
marry
me
i
think
it
hardly
possible
my
dear
i
answered
but
i
shall
lose
no
time
i
assure
you
once
you
are
my
wife
neither
hamdi
effendi
nor
the
sultan
of
turkey
can
claim
you
no
one
can
take
an
englishman
s
wife
away
from
hamdi
is
a
devil
said
carlotta
we
can
laugh
at
him
said
i
did
you
ever
see
such
an
ugly
mug
where
she
gets
her
occasional
bits
of
slang
from
i
do
not
know
but
her
little
foreign
staccato
pronunciation
gives
them
unusual
quaintness
i
laughed
and
carlotta
throwing
polyphemus
off
her
lap
laughed
too
and
sidled
up
against
me
the
cat
regarded
us
for
a
moment
with
a
disgusted
eye
then
stretched
himself
as
if
he
had
quitted
carlotta
of
his
own
accord
and
walked
away
in
a
state
of
dignified
boredom
hamdi
is
like
a
pig
and
an
elephant
and
a
great
fat
turkey
said
carlotta
if
all
the
world
were
beautiful
i
exclaimed
such
a
thing
as
our
appreciation
of
beauty
would
not
exist
i
should
not
even
be
aware
that
my
carlotta
was
she
put
her
hands
on
my
knees
in
her
impulsive
way
and
bending
forward
looked
at
me
delightedly
oh
you
do
think
so
you
are
the
loveliest
and
most
intoxicating
creature
on
the
earth
now
i
am
sure
sure
sure
she
cried
enraptured
you
have
never
said
it
before
seer
marcous
darling
and
i
must
kiss
i
checked
her
with
my
hands
on
her
soft
shoulders
only
if
you
promise
to
marry
of
course
said
carlotta
she
said
it
as
thoughtlessly
and
as
if
i
had
asked
her
to
come
out
for
a
walk
again
i
felt
the
odd
spasm
of
pain
in
my
late
madness
i
had
often
pictured
the
scene
how
i
should
hold
her
throbbing
beauty
in
my
arms
my
senses
clouded
with
the
fragrance
of
her
and
how
in
burning
words
i
should
pour
out
the
litany
of
my
passion
but
to
the
gods
it
seemed
otherwise
no
quaker
maiden
s
betrothal
kiss
was
chaster
cold
grew
the
fever
in
my
veins
and
the
litany
died
on
my
lips
who
and
what
is
she
whom
i
love
there
have
been
days
when
her
eyes
have
carried
in
their
depths
the
allurements
of
a
sorceress
when
her
limbs
have
woven
venusberg
enchantments
which
it
has
taken
all
my
strength
to
withstand
but
tonight
when
i
take
the
greatest
step
and
claim
her
as
mine
till
our
lives
end
she
yields
with
the
complaisance
of
an
ignorant
child
and
raises
up
between
us
the
barrier
of
her
innocence
when
shall
i
learn
the
soul
of
her
well
est
the
events
of
have
precipitated
our
destiny
in
all
probability
hamdi
is
powerless
to
take
her
from
my
protection
and
this
marriage
is
unnecessary
as
a
safeguard
i
have
no
notion
of
the
international
law
on
such
points
but
at
any
rate
it
will
make
the
assurance
of
her
safety
absolute
no
power
on
earth
can
take
her
from
me
great
heaven
the
thought
of
her
gone
forever
out
of
my
life
brings
the
cold
sweat
to
my
forehead
without
her
child
enchantress
changeling
that
she
is
how
could
i
face
existence
i
shall
have
my
heart
s
desire
why
i
should
be
athrill
with
the
joy
and
the
flame
of
youth
i
should
laugh
and
sing
i
should
perform
the
happy
antics
of
love
s
exuberance
i
should
be
transported
to
the
realms
where
the
fairy
tales
end
instead
i
sit
before
a
dying
fire
as
i
sat
last
night
and
am
oppressed
with
the
sense
of
tragedy
it
was
not
altogether
carlotta
s
innocence
that
formed
the
barrier
between
us
that
which
rendered
it
impassable
was

i
do
not
like
living
it
is
thoroughly
disagreeable
today
judith
taunted
me
with
never
having
lived
and
i
admitted
the
justice
of
the
taunt
and
regretted
in
poignant
misery
the
change
from
my
old
conditions
if
to
live
is
to
have
one
s
reason
cast
down
and
trampled
under
foot
one
s
heart
aflame
with
a
besotted
passion
and
one
s
soul
racked
with
remorse
then
am
i
living
in
good
sooth
and
i
would
far
rather
be
dead
and
suffering
the
milder
pains
of
purgatory
men
differently
constituted
get
used
to
it
as
the
eels
to
skinning
they
say
mea
culpa
damn
or
kismet
according
to
their
various
traditions
and
go
forth
comforted
to
their
workaday
pursuits
i
envy
them
i
enter
this
exquisite
torture
chamber
and
i
shriek
at
the
first
twinge
of
the
thumbscrew
and
faint
at
the
preliminary
embraces
of
the
scavenger
s
daughter
i
envy
a
fellow
like
caesar
borgia
he
could
murder
a
friend
seduce
his
widow
and
rob
the
orphans
all
on
a
summer
s
day
and
go
home
contentedly
to
supper
and
after
a
little
music
he
could
sleep
like
a
man
who
has
thoroughly
earned
his
repose
what
manner
of
creatures
are
other
men
they
area
blank
mystery
to
me
and
i
am
writing
or
have
been
writing
a
sociological
study
of
the
most
subtle
generation
of
them
that
has
ever
existed
i
am
an
empty
fool
i
know
absolutely
nothing
i
can
no
more
account
for
the
peaceful
slumbers
of
that
marvellous
young
man
of
than
i
can
predicate
the
priority
of
the
first
hen
or
the
first
egg
i
with
never
a
murder
or
a
seduction
or
a
robbery
on
my
conscience
could
not
sleep
last
night
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
sleep
i
feel
as
if
i
shall
remain
awake
through
the
centuries
with
a
rat
gnawing
my
vitals
so
unhappy
looking
a
woman
as
judith
when
i
called
on
her
early
this
forenoon
i
have
never
beheld
gone
was
the
elaborate
coquetry
of
yesterday
gone
the
quiet
roguishness
of
yesteryear
gone
was
all
the
judith
that
i
knew
and
in
her
place
stood
a
woman
shaking
at
gates
eternally
barred
i
thought
you
would
come
this
morning
i
had
that
lingering
faith
in
your
face
haunted
me
all
night
i
said
i
was
bound
to
so
this
is
the
end
of
it
all
she
remarked
stonily
no
said
i
it
only
marks
the
transition
from
a
very
relationship
to
as
loyal
a
friendship
as
ever
man
could
offer
she
gave
a
quivering
little
shrug
of
disgust
and
turned
away
oh
don
t
talk
like
that
i
can
t
offer
you
bread
but
i
ll
give
you
a
nice
round
polished
friendship
what
has
a
woman
like
me
got
to
do
with
friendship
have
i
ever
given
you
much
more
god
knows
what
you
have
given
me
she
cried
bitterly
she
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
sodden
street
and
murky
air
i
went
to
her
side
and
touched
her
wrist
for
heaven
s
sake
judith
tell
me
what
i
can
what
s
done
is
done
she
said
between
her
teeth
when
did
you
marry
her
i
explained
briefly
the
condition
of
affairs
she
looked
at
me
hard
and
long
then
stared
out
of
the
window
again
and
scarce
heeded
what
i
said
it
was
to
set
myself
right
with
you
on
this
point
i
added
that
i
have
visited
you
at
such
an
she
remained
silent
i
took
a
few
turns
about
the
familiar
room
that
was
filled
with
the
associations
of
many
years
the
piano
we
chose
together
the
copy
of
the
botticelli
tondo
the
crowned
madonna
of
the
uffizi
i
gave
her
in
florence
we
had
ransacked
london
together
to
find
the
chippendale
bookcase
and
on
its
shelves
stood
books
that
had
formed
a
bond
between
us
and
copies
of
old
reviews
containing
my
fugitive
contributions
a
spurious
japanese
dragon
in
faence
an
inartistic
monstrosity
dear
to
her
heart
at
which
i
had
often
railed
grinned
forgivingly
at
me
from
the
i
have
never
realised
how
closely
bound
up
with
my
habits
was
this
of
judith
s
i
stopped
once
more
by
her
side
i
can
t
leave
you
altogether
dear
i
said
gently
a
bit
of
myself
is
in
this
her
bosom
shook
with
unhappy
laughter
a
bit
then
she
turned
suddenly
on
me
are
you
simply
dull
or
sheerly
cruel
i
am
dull
said
i
why
do
you
refuse
my
friendship
our
relation
has
been
scarcely
more
it
has
not
touched
the
deep
things
in
us
we
agreed
at
the
start
that
it
should
not
the
words
i
love
you
have
never
passed
between
us
we
have
been
loyal
to
our
compact
now
that
love
has
come
into
my
life
and
heaven
knows
i
have
striven
against
it
what
would
you
have
me
do
and
what
would
you
have
me
do
said
judith
tonelessly
forgive
me
for
breaking
off
the
old
and
trust
me
to
make
the
new
pleasant
to
she
made
no
answer
but
stood
still
staring
out
of
the
window
like
a
woman
of
stone
presently
she
shivered
and
crossed
to
the
fire
before
which
she
crouched
on
a
low
chair
i
remained
by
the
window
anxious
puzzled
oppressed
marcus
she
said
at
last
in
a
low
voice
i
obeyed
her
summons
she
motioned
me
to
a
chair
and
without
looking
at
me
began
to
speak
you
said
there
was
a
bit
of
you
in
this
room
there
is
everything
of
you
your
whole
being
is
for
me
in
this
room
you
are
with
me
wherever
i
go
you
are
the
beginning
and
end
of
life
to
me
i
love
you
with
a
passion
that
is
killing
me
i
am
an
emotional
woman
i
made
shipwreck
of
myself
because
i
thought
i
loved
a
man
but
as
god
hears
me
you
are
the
only
man
i
have
loved
you
came
to
me
like
a
breath
of
heaven
while
i
was
in
purgatory
and
you
have
been
heaven
to
me
ever
since
it
has
been
play
to
you
but
to
me
i
fell
on
my
knees
beside
her
each
of
the
low
words
was
a
red
hot
iron
i
had
received
last
night
the
message
of
her
white
face
with
incredulity
i
had
reviewed
our
past
life
together
and
had
found
little
warrant
in
it
for
that
message
it
could
not
come
from
the
depths
it
was
staggeringly
impossible
and
now
the
impossible
was
the
flaming
fact
i
fell
on
my
knees
beside
her
not
play
judith
she
put
out
her
hand
to
check
me
and
the
words
died
on
my
lips
what
could
i
say
for
you
it
was
a
detached
pleasant
sentiment
if
you
like
for
me
the
deadliest
earnest
i
was
a
fool
too
you
never
said
you
loved
me
but
i
thought
you
did
you
were
not
as
other
men
you
knew
nothing
of
the
ways
of
the
world
or
of
women
or
of
passion
you
were
reserved
intellectual
you
viewed
things
in
a
queer
light
of
your
own
i
felt
that
the
touch
of
a
chain
would
fret
you
i
gave
you
absolute
freedom
often
when
i
craved
for
you
i
made
no
demands
i
assented
to
your
philosophic
analysis
of
the
situation
it
is
your
way
to
moralise
whimsically
on
everything
as
if
you
were
a
disconnected
intelligence
outside
the
universe
and
i
paid
no
attention
to
it
i
used
to
laugh
at
you
oh
not
unkindly
but
lovingly
happily
victoriously
oh
yes
i
was
a
fool
what
woman
in
love
isn
t
i
thought
i
gave
you
all
you
needed
i
was
content
secure
i
magnified
every
little
demonstration
when
you
touched
my
ear
it
was
more
to
me
than
the
embrace
of
another
man
might
have
been
i
have
lived
on
one
kiss
of
yours
for
a
week
to
you
the
kiss
was
of
no
more
value
than
a
cigarette
i
wish
she
added
in
a
whisper
i
wish
i
were
dead
she
had
spoken
in
a
low
monotonous
voice
staring
haggardly
at
the
fire
while
i
knelt
by
her
side
i
murmured
some
banal
apologia
miserably
aware
that
one
set
of
words
is
as
futile
as
another
when
one
has
broken
a
woman
s
heart
you
never
knew
i
loved
you
she
went
on
in
the
same
bitter
undertone
what
kind
of
woman
did
you
take
me
for
i
have
accepted
help
from
you
to
enable
me
to
live
in
this
flat
do
you
imagine
i
could
have
done
such
a
thing
without
loving
you
i
should
have
thought
it
was
obvious
in
a
thousand
the
fire
getting
low
she
took
up
the
scoop
for
coals
mechanically
i
relieved
her
of
the
thing
and
fulfilled
the
familiar
task
neither
spoke
for
a
long
time
she
remained
there
and
i
went
to
the
window
it
had
begun
to
rain
a
below
was
playing
some
horrible
air
and
every
vibrant
note
was
like
a
hammer
on
one
s
nerves
the
grinder
s
bedraggled
italian
wife
perceiving
me
at
the
window
grinned
up
at
me
with
the
national
curve
of
the
palm
she
had
a
black
eye
which
the
cacophonous
fiend
had
probably
given
her
and
she
grinned
like
a
happy
child
of
nature
men
in
my
position
do
not
blacken
women
s
eyes
but
it
is
only
a
question
of
manners
was
i
for
that
less
of
a
brute
male
than
the
scowling
beast
at
the
organ
the
sudden
sound
of
a
sob
made
me
turn
to
judith
who
had
broken
down
and
was
crying
bitterly
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
i
bent
and
touched
her
shoulder
judith
she
flung
her
arms
around
my
neck
i
can
t
give
you
up
i
can
t
i
can
t
i
can
t
she
cried
wildly
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
heard
a
woman
give
abandoned
incoherent
utterance
to
an
agony
of
passion
and
it
sounded
horrible
like
the
cry
of
an
animal
wounded
to
death
a
creature
scarce
daring
to
meet
her
eyes
i
bade
her
farewell
she
had
recovered
her
composure
make
me
one
little
promise
marcus
do
me
one
little
favour
she
said
with
quivering
lip
and
letting
her
cold
hand
remain
in
mine
stay
away
from
her
i
couldn
t
bear
to
think
of
you
and
her
together
happy
after
what
i
ve
said
this
morning
i
should
writhe
with
the
shame
and
the
torture
of
it
give
me
your
thoughts
wear
a
little
mourning
for
the
dead
it
is
all
i
ask
of
i
should
have
done
what
you
ask
without
the
asking
i
replied
i
kissed
her
hand
and
went
out
into
the
street
i
had
walked
but
a
few
blind
steps
when
i
became
aware
of
the
presence
and
voice
of
pasquale
coming
from
mainwaring
s
i
am
just
on
my
way
there
to
restore
her
which
i
ran
away
with
last
night
what
s
her
number
i
forget
i
dropped
in
at
lingfield
terrace
to
inquire
but
found
you
had
already
seventeen
i
answered
mechanically
you
are
not
looking
well
my
good
friend
said
he
i
hope
last
night
has
not
upset
you
it
s
all
bluff
you
know
on
the
part
of
the
precious
i
dare
say
it
was
i
assented
and
bluff
on
your
part
too
i
have
never
given
your
imaginative
faculties
sufficient
credit
it
bowled
hamdi
out
yes
said
i
it
bowled
him
out
serve
him
right
said
pasquale
he
s
the
wickedest
old
thief
quite
so
said
i
the
wickedest
old
thief
pasquale
shook
me
by
the
arm
are
you
a
man
or
a
phonograph
what
on
earth
has
happened
to
you
i
think
i
envied
the
laughter
in
his
handsome
dark
face
and
the
careless
grace
of
the
fellow
as
he
stood
beneath
the
dripping
umbrella
debonair
as
a
young
prince
in
perfectly
fitting
blue
wore
no
overcoat
mine
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
and
immaculate
suede
gloves
what
is
it
he
repeated
gaily
i
didn
t
sleep
last
night
said
i
my
breakfast
disagreed
with
me
and
it
s
raining
in
the
most
unpleasant
even
while
i
was
speaking
he
left
my
side
and
darted
across
the
road
in
some
astonishment
i
watched
him
for
a
moment
from
the
kerb
and
then
made
my
way
slowly
to
the
other
side
i
found
him
in
conversation
with
an
emaciated
bedraggled
woman
standing
by
an
enormous
bundle
about
three
times
her
own
cubic
bulk
which
she
had
rested
on
the
slimy
pavement
one
hand
pressed
a
panting
bosom
you
are
going
to
carry
that
in
your
arms
all
the
way
to
south
kensington
i
heard
him
cry
as
i
approached
yes
sir
said
the
woman
then
you
shan
t
i
m
not
going
to
allow
it
catch
hold
of
the
umbrella
which
he
thrust
out
at
her
she
clutched
automatically
to
prevent
it
falling
about
her
ears
the
veto
she
received
with
a
wonderment
which
deepened
into
stupefaction
when
she
saw
him
lift
the
huge
bundle
in
his
arms
and
stalk
away
with
it
down
the
street
she
turned
a
scared
face
at
me
it
s
washing
she
said
pasquale
paused
looked
round
and
motioned
her
onward
she
followed
without
a
word
holding
the
trim
silver
mounted
umbrella
and
i
mechanically
brought
up
the
rear
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
that
i
too
was
confused
the
scanty
populace
in
the
street
stared
and
gaped
a
shambling
fellow
in
corduroys
bawled
an
obscene
jest
pasquale
put
down
his
bundle
do
you
want
to
be
sent
to
hell
by
lightning
he
asked
with
the
evil
snarl
of
the
lips
no
said
the
man
sheering
off
i
m
glad
remarked
pasquale
picking
up
the
bundle
and
we
resumed
our
progress
luckily
a
cab
overtook
us
pasquale
stopped
it
squeezed
the
bundle
inside
and
held
the
door
open
for
the
faltering
and
bewildered
woman
as
if
she
had
been
the
authentic
duchessa
at
ealing
you
were
saying
ordeyne
he
observed
as
the
cabman
drove
off
with
three
shillings
and
his
incoherent
fare
you
were
saying
that
your
breakfast
disagreed
with
in
spite
of
my
heaviness
of
heart
i
laughed
and
loved
the
man
there
was
something
fantastically
chivalrous
in
the
action
something
superb
in
the
contempt
of
convention
something
whimsical
adventurous
unexpected
and
something
divine
in
the
wrathful
pity
and
something
irresistible
in
his
impudent
apostrophe
to
myself
it
has
been
the
one
flash
of
comfort
during
this
long
and
desolate
day
i
have
kept
my
promise
to
judith
i
have
lunched
and
dined
at
the
club
and
in
the
library
of
the
club
i
have
tried
to
while
away
the
hours
i
intended
this
morning
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
the
marriage
after
my
interview
with
judith
i
had
not
the
heart
i
put
it
off
till
i
have
observed
the
day
as
a
day
of
mourning
i
have
worn
sackcloth
and
ashes
i
have
done
such
penance
as
i
could
for
the
grievous
fault
i
have
committed
carlotta
is
in
bed
and
asleep
she
went
early
says
antoinette
having
a
bad
headache
no
wonder
poor
child
a
few
moments
ago
i
was
tempted
to
peep
into
her
room
and
satisfy
myself
that
she
was
not
ailing
a
headache
is
the
common
precursor
to
many
maladies
but
i
remembered
my
promise
and
refrained
the
cooing
notes
of
the
voice
would
have
called
me
to
her
side
and
her
arms
would
have
been
around
my
neck
and
i
should
have
forgotten
judith
chapter
xvii
october
i
rose
late
this
morning
when
i
went
down
to
breakfast
i
found
that
carlotta
had
already
gone
for
her
music
lesson
i
drove
at
once
to
the
temple
to
see
my
lawyers
and
to
make
arrangements
for
a
marriage
by
special
license
i
returned
at
one
o
clock
stenson
met
me
in
the
hall
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
marcus
but
mademoiselle
hasn
t
come
back
i
waited
an
uneasy
hour
such
a
lengthy
absence
from
home
was
unprecedented
at
two
o
clock
i
went
round
to
herr
stuer
in
the
avenue
road
a
five
minutes
walk
he
entered
the
into
which
i
had
been
ushered
wiping
his
lips
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
herr
stuer
said
i
but
will
you
kindly
tell
me
when
miss
carlotta
left
you
this
morning
miss
carlotta
came
not
at
all
this
morning
he
replied
but
it
was
her
regular
day
at
ten
o
clock
she
did
not
come
at
eleven
i
have
another
pupil
she
has
not
before
missed
one
i
flew
back
home
in
an
agony
of
hope
that
her
laughing
face
would
meet
me
there
and
dispel
a
dread
that
chilled
me
like
an
icy
wind
there
was
no
carlotta
there
has
been
no
carlotta
all
this
awful
day
there
will
never
be
a
carlotta
again
i
drove
to
the
police
station
what
do
you
think
has
happened
asked
the
inspector
it
was
only
too
horribly
obvious
any
man
but
myself
would
have
kept
her
under
lock
and
key
and
established
a
guard
round
the
house
any
man
but
myself
would
have
never
let
her
out
of
his
sight
until
he
had
married
her
until
he
had
tracked
hamdi
and
his
myrmidons
back
to
alexandretta
abduction
has
happened
i
cried
wildly
between
lingfield
terrace
and
avenue
road
she
has
been
caught
thrust
into
a
closed
carriage
gagged
and
carried
god
knows
where
by
the
wiliest
old
thief
in
asia
he
is
the
prefect
of
police
in
aleppo
his
name
is
hamdi
effendi
and
he
is
staying
at
the
hotel
the
inspector
questioned
me
heaven
knows
how
i
answered
i
saw
the
scene
the
waiting
carriage
the
unfrequented
bit
of
road
my
heart
s
darling
her
face
a
radiant
flower
in
the
grey
morning
tripping
lightheartedly
along
the
sudden
dash
the
struggle
the
swiftly
closed
door
it
was
a
matter
of
a
few
seconds
my
brain
grew
dizzy
with
the
vision
you
say
that
he
threatened
to
abduct
her
asked
the
inspector
yes
said
i
and
a
friend
of
mine
promised
to
kill
him
heaven
grant
he
keep
his
promise
be
careful
sir
marcus
smiled
the
inspector
or
if
there
is
a
murder
committed
you
will
be
an
accessory
before
the
i
intimated
my
disregard
of
the
contingency
what
did
it
matter
nothing
in
the
world
mattered
save
the
recovery
of
the
light
and
meaning
of
my
existence
my
friend
s
name
sebastian
pasquale
he
lived
near
by
in
the
john
s
wood
road
the
best
thing
you
can
do
sir
marcus
said
the
inspector
is
to
get
hold
of
pasquale
and
take
him
with
you
to
scotland
yard
perhaps
two
heads
will
be
better
than
one
in
the
meanwhile
we
shall
communicate
with
headquarters
and
make
the
necessary
inquiries
in
the
i
drove
to
john
s
wood
road
and
learned
to
my
dismay
that
pasquale
had
given
up
his
rooms
there
a
week
ago
all
his
letters
were
addressed
to
his
club
in
piccadilly
i
drove
thither
how
has
mankind
contented
itself
for
these
thousands
of
years
with
a
horse
as
its
chief
means
of
locomotion
oh
the
exasperation
i
suffered
behind
that
magnified
snail
i
dashed
into
the
club
pasquale
had
not
been
there
all
day
no
he
was
not
staying
there
it
was
against
the
rules
to
give
members
private
addresses
but
it
s
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
cried
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
said
the
hall
porter
mr
pasquale
s
only
permanent
address
is
his
banker
s
and
we
really
don
t
know
where
he
is
staying
at
i
wrote
a
hurried
line
hamdi
has
abducted
carlotta
i
am
half
crazed
as
you
love
me
give
me
your
help
oh
god
man
why
aren
t
you
here
i
left
it
with
the
porter
and
crawled
to
scotland
yard
the
cabman
at
my
invectives
against
his
sauntering
beast
waxed
indignant
it
was
a
blood
mare
and
one
of
the
fastest
trotters
in
london
she
passes
everything
said
he
it
is
because
everything
is
standing
still
or
going
backward
or
turned
upside
down
said
i
no
doubt
he
thought
me
mad
mad
as
a
dingo
dog
the
thought
of
the
words
the
summer
and
the
sun
sent
a
spasm
of
hunger
through
my
heart
then
i
murmured
to
myself
save
my
soul
from
hell
and
my
darling
from
the
power
of
the
which
dog
not
the
dingo
i
verily
believe
my
brain
worked
wrong
great
scotland
yard
at
last
i
went
through
passages
i
found
myself
in
a
nondescript
room
where
a
courteous
official
seated
at
a
desk
held
me
on
the
rack
for
half
an
hour
i
had
to
describe
carlotta
not
in
the
imagery
wherein
only
one
could
create
an
impression
of
her
sweetness
but
in
the
objective
terms
of
the
police
report
what
was
she
wearing
a
hat
and
jacket
a
skirt
shoes
of
course
she
wore
gloves
possibly
she
carried
a
muff
impatient
of
such
commonplace
details
i
described
her
fully
but
the
glory
of
her
bronze
hair
her
great
dark
brown
eyes
the
quivering
sensitiveness
of
her
lips
her
intoxicating
compound
of
botticelli
and
the
venusberg
the
of
her
voice
all
was
a
matter
of
boredom
to
scotland
yard
they
clamoured
for
the
colour
of
her
feathers
and
the
material
of
which
her
dress
was
made
her
height
in
vulgar
figures
and
the
sizes
of
her
gloves
and
shoes
how
on
earth
can
i
tell
you
i
cried
in
desperation
perhaps
one
of
your
servants
can
give
the
necessary
information
replied
the
urbane
official
if
i
had
lost
an
umbrella
he
could
not
have
viewed
my
plight
with
more
inhuman
blandness
a
miracle
happened
as
i
was
writing
a
summons
to
stenson
to
obtain
these
details
from
antoinette
and
attend
at
once
a
policeman
entered
and
i
learned
that
my
confidential
man
was
at
the
door
my
heart
leapt
within
me
he
had
tracked
me
hither
and
had
come
to
tell
me
that
carlotta
was
safe
but
the
first
glance
at
his
face
killed
the
wild
hope
he
had
tracked
me
hither
it
is
true
but
only
apologetically
to
offer
what
information
might
be
useful
it
is
a
very
great
liberty
sir
marcus
and
i
will
retire
at
once
if
i
have
overstepped
my
duties
but
there
are
important
details
sir
in
catastrophes
of
this
nature
with
which
my
experience
has
taught
me
only
servants
can
be
there
must
be
a
book
of
ten
thousand
pages
entitled
the
perfect
valet
dealing
with
every
contingency
of
domestic
life
which
this
admirable
fellow
has
by
heart
he
uttered
his
ciceronian
sentence
with
the
gravity
of
a
pasteboard
figure
in
the
toy
theatre
of
one
s
childhood
can
you
describe
the
young
lady
s
dress
asked
the
official
i
have
made
it
my
business
said
stenson
to
obtain
accurate
information
as
to
every
detail
of
mademoiselle
carlotta
s
attire
when
she
left
the
house
this
i
faded
into
insignificance
stenson
was
a
man
after
the
inspector
s
heart
a
few
eager
questions
brought
the
desired
result
a
dark
red
toque
with
a
grey
bird
s
wing
a
zouave
jacket
and
skirt
black
braided
a
dark
blue
bodice
a
plain
gold
brooch
the
first
trinket
i
had
given
her
the
occasion
of
her
first
clasp
of
arms
around
my
neck
fastening
her
collar
a
silver
fox
necklet
and
muff
patent
leather
shoes
and
brown
suede
gloves
any
special
mark
or
characteristics
a
white
scar
above
the
left
temple
said
stenson
lord
have
mercy
the
man
has
lived
day
by
day
for
five
months
with
carlotta
s
magical
beauty
and
all
he
has
noticed
as
characteristic
is
the
little
white
scar
she
fell
on
marble
steps
as
a
child
the
only
flaw
if
flaw
can
be
in
a
thing
so
imperceptible
in
her
perfect
loveliness
mademoiselle
has
also
a
tiny
mole
behind
her
right
ear
said
stenson
the
inspector
s
conception
of
stenson
expanded
into
an
apotheosis
he
paid
him
deference
his
pen
wrote
greedily
every
syllable
the
inspired
creature
uttered
when
the
fount
of
inspiration
ran
dry
stenson
turned
to
me
with
his
imperturbable
profoundly
respectful
air
shall
i
return
home
sir
marcus
or
have
you
any
further
need
of
my
service
i
bade
him
go
home
he
withdrew
the
inspector
smiled
cheerfully
now
we
can
get
along
said
he
it
s
a
pity
pasquale
he
consulted
his
notes
is
out
of
touch
with
us
for
the
moment
he
might
have
given
us
great
he
rose
from
his
chair
i
think
we
shall
very
soon
trace
the
young
lady
an
accurate
personal
description
like
this
you
see
is
he
handed
me
the
printed
form
which
he
had
filled
in
in
spite
of
my
misery
i
almost
laughed
at
the
fatuity
of
the
man
in
thinking
that
those
mere
unimaginative
statistics
applicable
to
five
hundred
thousand
young
females
in
london
could
in
any
way
express
carlotta
this
is
all
very
well
said
i
but
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
lay
that
turkish
devil
by
the
you
can
count
on
our
making
the
most
prompt
and
thorough
investigation
said
he
and
in
the
mean
time
what
can
i
do
your
best
course
sir
marcus
he
answered
is
to
go
home
and
leave
things
in
our
hands
as
soon
as
ever
we
have
the
slightest
clue
we
shall
communicate
with
he
bowed
me
out
politely
in
a
few
moments
i
found
myself
in
the
greyness
of
the
autumn
afternoon
wandering
on
the
thames
embankment
like
a
lost
soul
on
the
banks
of
phlegethon
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
never
seen
the
sun
should
never
see
the
sun
again
i
was
drifting
sans
purpose
into
eternity
i
passed
by
some
railings
a
colossal
figure
looming
through
the
misty
air
struck
me
with
a
sense
of
familiarity
it
was
the
statue
of
sir
bartle
frere
and
these
were
the
gardens
beneath
the
terrace
of
the
national
liberal
club
it
was
here
that
i
had
first
met
her
the
dripping
trees
seemed
to
hold
the
echo
of
the
words
spoken
when
their
leaves
were
green
will
you
please
to
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
i
strained
my
eyes
to
see
the
bench
on
which
i
had
sat
and
my
eyes
tricked
me
into
translating
a
blurr
at
the
end
of
the
seat
into
the
ghostly
form
of
carlotta
my
misery
overwhelmed
me
and
through
my
misery
shot
a
swift
pang
of
remorse
at
having
treated
her
harshly
on
that
sweet
and
memorable
afternoon
in
may
i
turned
the
corner
at
whitehall
place
and
looked
down
the
desolate
gardens
the
benches
were
empty
the
trees
were
bare
and
no
birds
i
crossed
the
road
the
hotel
metropole
the
great
doors
stood
invitingly
open
and
from
the
pavement
one
could
see
the
warmth
and
colour
of
the
vestibule
here
was
staying
the
who
had
robbed
me
of
my
life
i
stood
for
a
moment
under
the
portico
shaking
with
rage
i
must
have
lost
consciousness
for
a
few
seconds
for
i
do
not
remember
entering
or
mounting
the
stairs
i
found
myself
at
the
bureau
asking
for
hamdi
effendi
no
he
had
not
left
they
thought
he
was
in
the
hotel
a
page
despatched
in
search
of
him
departed
with
my
card
bawling
a
number
i
hate
these
big
caravanserais
where
one
is
a
mere
number
as
in
a
gaol
would
to
heaven
it
were
a
gaol
i
muttered
to
myself
and
this
were
the
number
of
hamdi
effendi
a
lean
man
rose
from
a
chair
and
holding
out
his
hand
effusively
saluted
me
by
name
i
stared
at
him
he
recalled
our
acquaintance
at
etretat
i
fished
him
up
from
the
deeps
of
a
previous
incarnation
and
vaguely
remembered
him
as
a
young
american
floral
decorator
who
used
to
preach
to
me
the
eternal
doctrine
of
hustle
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
hoped
that
he
was
well
going
very
strong
never
stronger
never
so
well
as
when
i
m
full
up
with
work
but
you
don
t
hurry
around
enough
in
this
dear
sleepy
old
country
men
lunch
in
new
york
all
the
lunch
one
has
time
for
is
to
swallow
a
plasmon
lozenge
in
a
his
high
pitched
voice
shrieked
bombastic
platitude
into
my
ears
for
an
illimitable
time
i
answered
occasionally
with
the
fringe
of
my
mind
could
my
agonised
state
of
being
have
remained
unperceived
by
any
human
creature
save
this
young
hustling
new
york
floral
decorator
since
we
met
guess
how
many
times
i
ve
crossed
the
atlantic
four
times
atlantic
and
about
yourself
still
going
with
books
and
things
yes
books
and
things
i
echud
the
page
came
up
and
announced
hamdi
s
intention
of
immediate
appearance
and
how
is
that
charming
young
lady
your
ward
miss
carlotta
continued
my
tormentor
yes
i
answered
hurriedly
a
charming
young
lady
you
used
to
give
her
sweets
have
you
noticed
that
a
fondness
for
sugar
plums
induces
an
equanimity
of
character
it
also
spoils
the
teeth
that
is
why
the
front
teeth
of
all
american
women
are
so
i
must
be
endowed
with
the
low
cunning
of
the
fox
who
i
am
told
by
a
swift
turn
puts
his
pursuers
off
the
scent
the
learned
term
the
rhetorical
device
an
my
young
friend
s
patriotism
rose
in
furious
defence
of
his
countrywomen
s
beauty
i
looked
round
the
luxuriously
furnished
vestibule
wondering
from
which
of
the
many
doors
the
object
of
my
hatred
would
emerge
and
my
young
friend
s
talk
continued
to
ruffle
the
fringe
of
my
mind
i
m
afraid
you
re
expecting
some
one
rather
badly
he
remarked
with
piercing
perceptiveness
a
dull
acquaintance
said
i
i
shall
be
sorry
when
his
arrival
puts
an
end
to
our
engaging
then
the
lift
door
opened
and
hamdi
stepped
out
like
the
devil
in
an
alhambra
ballet
he
looked
at
my
card
and
looked
at
me
he
bowed
politely
i
did
not
know
whom
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
said
he
in
his
execrable
french
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
service
to
sir
marcus
ordeyne
what
have
you
done
with
carlotta
i
asked
glaring
at
him
his
ignoble
pitted
face
assumed
an
expression
of
bland
inquiry
carlotta
yes
said
i
where
have
you
taken
her
to
explain
yourself
monsieur
said
hamdi
do
i
understand
that
lady
ordeyne
has
disappeared
tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
his
crafty
features
grew
satanic
his
long
fleshy
nose
squirmed
like
the
proboscis
of
one
of
orcagna
s
fiends
really
monsieur
said
he
with
a
hideous
leer
oh
words
are
impotent
to
express
the
ugliness
of
that
face
really
monsieur
supposing
i
had
stolen
miladi
you
would
be
the
last
person
i
should
inform
of
her
whereabouts
you
are
simple
monsieur
i
had
always
heard
that
england
was
a
country
of
arcadian
innocence
so
unlike
my
own
black
wicked
country
and
now
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
blandly
en
suis
you
may
jeer
hamdi
effendi
said
i
in
a
white
passion
of
anger
but
the
english
police
you
will
not
find
so
ah
so
you
have
been
to
the
police
said
the
suave
villain
you
have
gone
to
scotland
scotland
place
scotland
n
importe
they
are
investigating
the
affair
i
thank
you
for
the
friendly
warning
i
cried
choked
with
indignation
he
held
up
a
soft
fat
palm
ah
it
is
not
a
warning
then
monsieur
i
am
afraid
you
have
committed
an
indiscretion
which
your
friends
in
scotland
place
will
not
pardon
you
you
would
not
make
a
good
police
agent
i
am
of
the
profession
so
i
i
advanced
a
step
he
recoiled
casting
a
quick
look
backward
at
the
lift
just
then
standing
idle
with
open
doors
hamdi
effendi
i
cried
by
the
living
god
if
you
do
not
restore
me
my
wife
but
then
i
stopped
short
hamdi
had
stepped
quickly
backward
into
the
lift
and
given
a
sign
to
the
attendant
the
door
slammed
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
shake
my
fist
at
hamdi
s
boots
as
they
disappeared
upwards
i
remember
once
in
italy
seeing
a
cat
playing
with
a
partially
stunned
bat
which
flying
low
she
had
brought
to
the
ground
she
crouched
patted
it
made
it
move
a
little
patted
it
again
and
retired
on
her
haunches
preparing
for
a
spring
suddenly
the
bat
shot
vertically
into
the
air
i
stared
at
the
ascending
lift
with
the
cat
s
expression
of
impotent
dismay
and
stupefaction
it
was
inconceivably
grotesque
it
brought
into
my
tragedy
an
element
of
infernal
farce
i
became
conscious
of
peals
of
laughter
and
looking
round
beheld
the
american
doubled
up
in
a
saddlebag
chair
i
fled
from
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
derision
i
am
at
home
sitting
at
my
walking
restlessly
about
the
room
stepping
out
into
the
raw
air
on
the
balcony
and
looking
for
a
sign
down
the
dark
and
silent
road
i
curse
myself
for
my
folly
in
entering
the
hotel
metropole
the
damned
turk
held
me
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
made
mock
of
me
to
his
heart
s
content
and
carlotta
is
in
his
power
i
grow
white
with
terror
when
i
think
of
terror
she
is
somewhere
locked
up
in
a
room
in
this
great
city
my
god
where
can
she
be
the
police
must
find
her
london
is
not
mediaeval
italy
for
women
to
be
gagged
and
carried
off
to
inaccessible
strongholds
in
defiance
of
laws
and
government
i
repeat
to
myself
that
she
must
come
back
that
the
sober
working
of
english
institutions
will
restore
her
to
my
arms
that
my
agony
is
a
matter
of
a
day
or
two
at
most
that
the
special
license
obtained
this
morning
and
now
lying
before
me
is
not
the
document
of
irony
it
seems
and
that
in
a
week
s
time
we
shall
look
back
on
this
nightmare
of
a
day
with
a
smile
and
look
forward
to
the
future
with
laughter
in
our
hearts
but
i
am
very
lonely
loneliness
says
epictetus
is
a
certain
condition
of
the
helpless
and
i
am
helpless
all
my
aid
lies
in
the
learning
in
those
books
and
all
the
learning
in
all
those
books
on
all
sides
from
floor
to
ceiling
can
not
render
me
one
infinitesimal
grain
of
practical
assistance
if
only
pasquale
man
of
action
swift
intelligence
were
here
i
can
only
trust
to
the
trained
methods
of
the
unimaginative
machine
who
has
set
out
to
trace
carlotta
by
means
of
the
scar
on
her
forehead
and
the
mole
behind
her
ear
and
meanwhile
i
am
very
lonely
my
sole
friend
to
whom
i
could
have
turned
mcmurray
is
still
at
bude
she
is
to
have
a
child
i
understand
in
the
near
future
and
will
stay
in
cornwall
till
the
confinement
is
over
her
husband
even
were
he
not
amid
the
midnight
stress
of
his
newspaper
office
i
should
shrink
from
seeking
he
is
a
niagara
of
a
man
judith
i
can
go
to
her
no
more
and
though
antoinette
has
wept
her
heart
out
all
day
long
poor
soul
and
stenson
has
conveyed
by
his
manner
his
respectful
sympathy
i
can
not
take
counsel
of
my
own
servants
i
have
gathered
into
my
arms
the
cat
and
buried
my
face
in
his
fur
where
carlotta
s
face
has
been
buried
that
s
the
way
i
should
like
to
be
kissed
oh
my
dear
my
dear
were
you
here
now
that
is
the
way
i
should
kiss
you
i
have
gone
upstairs
and
wandered
about
her
room
antoinette
has
prepared
it
for
her
reception
as
usual
the
corner
of
the
bedclothes
is
turned
down
and
her
a
gossamer
thing
with
cherry
ribbons
laid
out
across
the
bed
at
the
foot
lie
the
familiar
red
slippers
with
the
audacious
heels
her
is
thrown
in
readiness
over
the
back
of
a
chair
even
the
brass
hot
water
can
stands
in
the
basin
and
it
is
still
hot
and
i
know
that
the
foolish
woman
is
overhead
waiting
for
her
darling
i
kissed
the
pillow
still
fragrant
of
her
where
her
head
rested
last
night
and
i
went
downstairs
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
again
i
sit
at
my
and
to
save
myself
from
going
mad
with
suspense
jot
down
in
my
the
things
that
have
happened
put
in
bald
words
they
scarcely
seem
credible
it
will
be
borne
in
mind
that
i
am
writing
these
actual
pages
afterwards
at
verona
amplifying
the
rough
notes
in
my
diary
o
a
sudden
clattering
strident
peal
at
the
bell
i
flew
down
the
stairs
it
was
news
of
carlotta
it
was
carlotta
herself
brought
back
to
me
my
heart
swelled
with
joy
as
if
it
would
burst
i
knew
that
as
i
opened
the
door
carlotta
would
fall
laughing
weeping
sobbing
into
my
arms
i
opened
the
door
it
was
only
a
police
officer
in
plain
clothes
sir
marcus
ordeyne
we
have
traced
the
young
lady
all
right
she
left
london
by
the
continental
express
from
victoria
with
sebastian
chapter
xviii
november
five
days
ago
the
blow
fell
and
i
am
only
now
recovering
only
now
awakening
to
the
horrible
pain
of
it
i
have
gone
about
like
a
man
in
a
dream
blurred
visages
of
men
with
voices
have
saluted
me
at
the
club
innumerable
lines
of
print
which
my
eyes
have
scanned
have
been
destitute
of
meaning
i
have
forced
myself
to
the
mechanical
task
of
copying
piles
of
rough
notes
for
my
history
i
have
been
able
to
bring
thereto
not
an
atom
of
intelligence
popes
princes
painters
are
a
category
of
disassociated
names
less
evocative
of
ideas
than
the
columns
in
the
post
office
london
directory
i
have
stared
stupidly
into
the
fire
or
at
the
dripping
branches
of
the
trees
opposite
my
windows
i
have
walked
the
streets
in
dull
misery
i
have
sought
solace
in
the
zoological
gardens
there
is
a
kindly
brown
bear
who
pleads
humanly
for
buns
and
her
i
have
fed
into
a
sort
of
friendship
i
stand
vacantly
in
front
of
the
cage
finding
in
the
beast
an
odd
companionable
sympathy
she
turns
her
head
on
one
side
regards
me
with
melting
brown
eyes
and
squatting
on
her
haunches
thrusts
her
paws
beseechingly
through
the
bars
just
so
did
carlotta
beseech
and
plead
i
have
bemused
myself
with
gnostic
and
metempsychosic
speculations
carlotta
as
an
ordinary
human
being
with
an
immortal
soul
did
not
exist
and
what
i
had
known
and
loved
was
but
a
simulacrum
of
female
form
containing
an
elemental
spirit
doomed
to
be
ever
seeking
a
fresh
habitat
it
was
but
the
lingering
ghost
of
the
humanised
shell
of
air
that
was
seen
at
victoria
station
the
fateful
spirit
untrammelled
by
the
conventions
of
men
and
actuated
by
destinies
unintelligible
to
mortal
mind
had
informed
the
carcass
of
this
little
brown
bear
which
looks
at
me
so
strangely
so
coaxingly
with
carlotta
s
eyes
and
carlotta
s
gestures
i
asked
her
yesterday
to
come
back
to
me
i
said
that
the
house
was
empty
that
the
rooms
ached
for
the
want
of
her
i
pleaded
so
passionately
and
the
eyes
before
me
so
melted
that
i
thought
her
heart
was
touched
but
in
the
midst
of
it
all
another
visitor
came
up
and
the
creature
uttered
a
whining
plaint
and
put
out
her
paw
for
buns
by
which
token
i
felt
indeed
that
it
was
carlotta
i
have
accepted
the
blow
silently
as
yet
i
have
told
no
one
i
have
made
no
inquiries
when
a
man
is
betrayed
by
his
best
friend
and
deserted
by
the
woman
he
loves
time
and
solitude
are
the
only
comforters
besides
to
whom
should
i
go
for
comfort
i
have
lived
too
remote
from
my
kind
and
my
kind
heeds
me
not
not
a
line
has
reached
me
from
carlotta
she
has
gone
out
of
my
life
as
lightly
and
as
remorselessly
as
she
went
out
of
hamdi
effendi
s
as
she
went
for
aught
she
knew
out
of
that
of
the
unhappy
boy
who
lured
her
from
alexandretta
if
she
heard
i
was
dead
i
wonder
whether
she
would
say
i
am
so
glad
whether
the
flight
was
planned
between
them
or
whether
pasquale
waylaid
her
on
her
way
to
the
avenue
road
and
then
and
there
proposed
that
she
should
accompany
him
i
do
not
know
it
matters
very
little
she
is
gone
that
is
the
one
awful
fact
that
signifies
no
explanations
pleas
for
forgiveness
could
make
me
suffer
less
were
she
different
i
might
find
it
in
my
heart
to
hate
her
this
i
can
not
do
how
can
one
hate
a
thing
devoid
of
heart
and
soul
but
one
can
love
it
god
knows
how
blindly
so
i
have
locked
the
door
of
carlotta
s
room
and
the
key
is
in
my
possession
it
shall
not
be
touched
it
shall
remain
just
as
she
left
it
and
i
shall
mourn
for
her
as
for
one
dead
for
pasquale
if
i
were
of
his
own
reversionary
type
i
should
follow
him
half
across
europe
till
we
met
and
then
one
of
us
would
kill
the
other
in
one
respect
he
resembles
carlotta
he
is
destitute
of
the
moral
sense
how
else
to
solve
the
enigma
how
else
to
reconcile
his
flamboyant
chivalry
towards
the
consumptive
with
the
black
treachery
towards
me
in
which
even
at
that
very
moment
his
mind
must
have
been
steeped
i
knew
that
he
had
betrayed
many
that
where
women
were
concerned
no
considerations
of
honour
or
friendship
had
stood
between
him
and
his
desires
but
i
believed
for
what
reason
save
my
own
egregious
vanity
i
know
not
that
for
me
he
had
a
peculiar
regard
i
believed
that
it
was
an
idiosyncrasy
of
this
wolf
to
look
upon
my
sheepfold
as
sacred
from
his
depredations
i
was
ashamed
of
any
doubts
that
crossed
my
mind
as
to
his
loyalty
and
did
not
hesitate
to
thrust
my
lamb
between
his
jaws
and
while
he
was
giving
the
lie
direct
to
my
faith
i
poor
fool
in
my
despair
was
seeking
madly
for
his
aid
in
the
deliverance
of
my
darling
from
the
power
of
the
dog
i
have
felt
i
owe
hamdi
effendi
an
apology
for
it
is
well
that
in
the
midst
of
this
buffoon
tragedy
i
find
myself
playing
i
should
observe
occasionally
the
decencies
of
conduct
but
on
the
other
hand
was
he
not
amply
repaid
for
moral
injury
by
the
pure
joy
he
must
have
felt
while
torturing
me
with
his
banter
for
all
the
deeper
suffering
i
am
conscious
of
writhing
under
lacerated
vanity
when
i
think
of
that
grotesque
and
humiliating
blunder
in
the
hotel
metropole
november
i
have
received
news
of
the
death
of
old
simon
mcquhatty
in
my
few
lucid
moments
of
late
i
had
been
thinking
of
seeking
his
kindly
presence
now
gossip
death
has
taken
him
out
across
the
moor
now
dear
old
pagan
he
is
rolled
round
in
earth
s
diurnal
course
with
rocks
and
stones
and
november
antoinette
came
up
this
morning
with
a
large
cardboard
box
addressed
to
carlotta
the
messenger
who
brought
it
was
waiting
downstairs
i
came
to
monsieur
to
know
whether
i
should
send
it
back
said
antoinette
on
the
verge
of
tears
no
said
i
leave
it
from
the
furrier
s
label
i
saw
that
the
box
contained
some
furs
i
had
ordered
for
carlotta
a
fortnight
ago
she
shivered
so
poor
child
in
this
wintry
climate
but
monsieur
began
antoinette
the
poor
angel
may
want
it
in
heaven
said
i
the
good
woman
stared
we
ll
be
like
the
ancient
egyptians
antoinette
i
explained
who
placed
food
and
wine
and
raiment
and
costly
offerings
in
the
tombs
of
the
departed
so
that
their
shades
could
come
and
enjoy
them
for
all
eternity
we
ll
have
to
make
believe
antoinette
that
this
is
a
tomb
for
one
can
t
rear
a
pyramid
in
london
though
it
is
a
desert
sufficiently
vast
and
the
little
second
floor
room
is
the
inner
sanctuary
where
the
body
lies
in
silence
embalmed
with
sweet
spices
and
swathed
in
endless
bands
of
but
mademoiselle
is
not
dead
cried
antoinette
with
a
shiver
how
can
monsieur
talk
of
such
things
it
makes
me
fear
the
way
monsieur
it
makes
me
fear
too
antoinette
said
i
gravely
when
she
had
gone
i
took
the
box
of
furs
upstairs
and
laid
it
unopened
on
carlotta
s
bed
and
came
away
relocking
the
door
behind
me
november
i
have
formed
a
great
resolution
i
have
devoted
the
week
to
the
envisagement
of
things
and
while
i
lay
awake
last
night
the
solution
came
to
me
as
something
final
and
irrevocable
mistrusting
the
counsels
of
the
night
when
the
brain
is
unduly
excited
by
nervous
insomnia
i
have
applied
the
test
of
a
day
s
cold
reason
i
have
broken
a
woman
s
heart
i
have
spurned
the
passionate
love
of
a
woman
who
has
been
near
and
dear
to
me
a
woman
of
great
nature
a
woman
of
subtle
brain
who
has
been
my
chosen
companion
my
equal
partner
in
any
intellectual
path
i
chose
to
tread
a
sensitive
lady
with
all
the
graciousness
of
soul
that
term
conveys
heaven
knows
what
a
woman
can
see
in
me
to
love
i
look
in
the
glass
at
my
bony
face
on
which
the
stamp
of
futility
seems
eternally
set
and
i
am
seized
with
a
prodigious
wonder
but
the
fact
remains
that
to
me
unlovely
and
unworthy
has
been
given
that
thing
without
price
a
woman
s
love
i
remember
pasquale
laughing
merrily
at
this
valuation
he
said
the
love
of
women
was
as
cheap
as
dirt
and
the
only
use
for
it
was
to
make
mud
pies
the
damned
cynical
villain
always
reflect
said
he
on
another
occasion
that
although
a
man
may
be
as
ugly
as
sin
the
probability
is
that
he
is
just
as
pleasant
beauties
will
find
hitherto
unsuspected
amenities
in
beasts
till
the
end
of
but
i
am
such
a
poor
and
sorry
beast
without
the
chance
of
a
transformation
a
commonplace
beast
dull
and
didactic
a
besotted
purblind
despicable
beast
yet
judith
loved
me
instead
of
thanking
on
my
knees
the
high
gods
for
the
boon
conferred
i
rejected
it
and
went
mad
for
craving
of
the
infinitely
lesser
glory
of
carlotta
s
baby
lips
and
hair
i
have
broken
judith
s
heart
i
will
expiate
the
crime
i
have
committed
expiate
the
crime
the
realisation
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
covers
me
with
shame
as
if
what
i
propose
will
be
a
sorry
penance
that
is
the
danger
of
a
man
thinking
as
i
have
always
done
in
metaphors
it
has
given
me
my
loose
indirect
views
of
life
of
myself
of
those
around
me
if
i
had
advice
to
offer
to
a
young
man
i
should
say
learn
to
think
expiate
indeed
i
will
go
to
her
and
make
confession
i
will
tell
her
that
awful
loneliness
is
crushing
my
soul
i
will
kneel
before
her
and
beseech
her
of
her
great
woman
s
goodness
to
give
me
her
love
again
and
to
be
my
helpmeet
and
my
companion
who
will
be
cherished
with
all
that
there
is
of
loyalty
in
me
to
her
life
s
end
she
will
pity
me
a
little
for
i
have
suffered
and
i
will
pity
her
tenderly
in
deep
sincerity
and
our
life
together
will
be
based
on
that
which
signifies
and
it
shall
be
a
real
life
together
i
used
to
smile
in
a
superior
way
at
her
dread
of
solitude
heaven
forgive
me
i
did
not
then
know
its
terrors
it
comforted
for
the
first
few
benumbed
days
but
now
it
is
gathering
around
me
like
a
mysterious
and
appalling
force
i
crave
the
human
presence
in
my
home
i
need
the
woman
s
presence
in
my
heart
we
shall
live
together
then
as
man
and
wife
in
defiance
of
the
world
let
the
moralists
blame
us
we
shall
not
care
it
will
make
little
social
difference
to
judith
and
as
for
myself
have
i
not
already
inflicted
public
outrage
on
society
does
not
my
aunt
jessica
regard
me
as
a
wringer
of
the
public
conscience
and
does
not
my
cousin
rosalie
mention
me
with
a
shudder
of
horror
in
her
tepid
prayers
if
i
really
give
them
cause
for
reprobation
they
will
be
neither
wiser
nor
better
nor
sorrier
and
if
the
baronetcy
flickers
out
in
unseemly
odour
i
for
one
shall
know
that
the
odour
is
sweeter
than
that
wherein
it
was
lighted
when
my
earned
the
radiance
by
services
rendered
at
brighton
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
make
judith
reparation
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
find
comfort
we
shall
travel
italy
beloved
of
judith
is
calling
me
probably
florence
will
be
our
settled
home
i
shall
give
up
this
house
of
madness
the
clean
sweet
love
of
judith
will
purify
my
heart
of
this
poisonous
passion
and
in
the
end
there
will
be
peace
i
have
taken
carlotta
s
photograph
from
its
frame
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
thus
burning
her
for
her
witchcraft
i
watched
the
flames
leap
and
curl
the
last
look
she
gave
me
before
they
licked
away
her
face
had
its
infinite
allurement
its
devilish
sorcery
so
intensified
in
the
fierce
yellow
light
that
the
yearning
for
her
clutched
me
by
the
throat
and
shook
me
through
all
my
being
but
it
is
over
now
i
have
done
with
carlotta
if
she
thinks
i
am
going
to
sit
and
let
the
wind
which
comes
over
primrose
hill
drive
me
mad
like
gastibelza
homme
a
la
in
victor
hugo
s
poem
she
is
vastly
mistaken
from
this
hour
henceforth
i
swear
she
is
nothing
to
me
i
will
eat
and
sleep
and
laugh
as
if
she
had
never
existed
polyphemus
curled
up
in
carlotta
s
old
place
on
the
sofa
regards
me
with
his
sardonic
eye
he
is
an
evil
incredulous
mocking
beast
who
a
few
centuries
ago
would
have
been
burned
with
his
late
mistress
i
am
sane
and
happier
now
that
i
have
come
to
my
irrevocable
determination
i
go
to
judith
chapter
xix
november
i
had
to
ring
twice
before
judith
s
servant
opened
the
flat
door
mrs
mainwaring
is
engaged
just
at
present
sir
ask
her
if
i
can
come
in
and
wait
as
i
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
she
left
me
standing
in
the
passage
a
thing
that
had
never
before
occurred
to
me
in
judith
s
establishment
and
presently
returned
with
her
answer
would
i
mind
waiting
in
the
i
entered
the
table
was
littered
with
sheets
of
her
statistical
work
and
odd
bits
of
silk
and
lining
a
stood
at
one
end
and
a
at
the
other
on
the
by
the
window
in
the
midst
of
a
mass
of
letters
and
rested
a
large
bowl
filled
with
magnificent
blooms
of
white
and
yellow
chrysanthemums
a
volume
of
dante
lay
open
face
downwards
on
the
corner
it
did
my
heart
good
to
see
this
untidiness
so
characteristic
of
judith
so
familiar
so
intimate
she
had
taken
her
trouble
bravely
i
reflected
the
ordinary
daily
task
had
not
been
left
undone
through
all
she
had
preserved
her
valiant
sanity
i
felt
rebuked
for
my
own
loss
of
i
was
about
to
turn
away
from
the
litter
of
the
desk
when
my
eye
caught
sight
of
an
envelope
bearing
a
french
stamp
and
addressed
in
pasquale
s
unmistakable
handwriting
as
there
seemed
to
be
a
letter
inside
i
did
not
take
it
up
to
examine
it
more
closely
the
glance
was
enough
to
assure
me
that
it
came
from
pasquale
why
should
he
be
corresponding
with
judith
i
walked
away
puzzled
was
it
a
justification
a
confession
a
plea
to
her
as
my
friend
to
obtain
my
forgiveness
if
there
is
one
thing
more
irritating
than
another
it
is
to
light
accidentally
upon
a
mystery
affecting
oneself
in
a
friend
s
correspondence
one
can
no
more
probe
deeply
into
it
than
one
can
steal
the
friend
s
spoons
it
seems
an
indiscretion
to
have
noticed
it
an
unpardonable
impertinence
to
subject
it
to
conjecture
in
spite
of
my
abhorring
the
impulse
of
curiosity
the
sweeping
flaunting
swaggering
handwriting
of
pasquale
worried
me
judith
came
in
looking
much
as
she
had
done
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
worn
and
anxious
with
a
strange
expression
in
her
eyes
i
am
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
she
said
extending
a
lifeless
hand
i
raised
it
to
my
lips
i
would
have
gladly
waited
all
day
to
see
you
judith
i
said
really
she
laughed
in
an
odd
way
and
idle
speech
from
me
to
you
at
the
present
time
would
be
an
outrage
i
answered
i
have
passed
through
much
since
i
saw
you
so
have
i
said
judith
more
than
you
imagine
well
she
continued
as
i
bowed
my
head
accepting
the
rebuke
what
have
you
got
so
important
to
tell
me
much
said
i
in
the
first
place
you
must
be
aware
of
what
has
happened
for
i
can
t
help
seeing
there
a
letter
from
she
glanced
swiftly
at
the
desk
and
back
again
at
me
yes
she
replied
he
is
in
i
was
amazed
at
her
nonchalance
has
he
told
you
nothing
perhaps
sir
marcus
ordeyne
would
like
to
see
his
letter
she
said
ironically
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
would
not
read
it
said
judith
laughed
again
and
rolled
her
handkerchief
into
a
little
ball
between
her
nervous
fingers
forgive
me
she
said
i
like
to
see
the
in
you
now
and
then
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
happier
days
but
about
pasquale
the
only
thing
he
tells
me
is
that
he
is
not
able
to
execute
a
commission
for
me
he
told
me
on
the
night
he
drove
me
home
that
he
was
going
to
paris
and
i
asked
him
to
get
me
some
cosmetic
carmine
badouin
if
you
want
to
know
i
have
got
to
rouge
now
before
i
am
fit
to
be
seen
in
the
street
i
am
quite
frank
about
then
you
know
nothing
of
carlotta
i
cried
carlotta
she
eloped
with
that
damned
infernal
villain
the
day
after
i
saw
judith
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
closed
her
eyes
and
turned
her
head
away
resting
her
hand
on
the
table
my
indignation
waxed
hot
against
the
scoundrel
how
dare
he
write
casual
letters
to
judith
about
carmine
badouin
with
his
treachery
on
his
conscience
i
know
the
terms
of
flippant
grace
in
which
the
knave
couched
this
precious
epistle
and
i
could
see
carlotta
reading
over
his
shoulder
and
clapping
her
hands
and
cooing
oh
that
is
so
funny
when
i
had
told
judith
the
outlines
of
the
story
pacing
up
and
down
the
little
room
while
she
remained
motionless
by
the
table
she
put
out
her
hand
to
me
and
in
a
low
voice
and
with
still
averted
eyes
said
that
she
was
sorry
deeply
sorry
her
tone
rang
so
true
and
loyal
that
my
heart
throbbed
with
quick
appreciation
of
her
high
nature
and
i
wrung
her
outstretched
hand
god
bless
you
judith
i
cried
fervently
bless
you
for
your
sweet
sympathy
be
sorry
for
me
only
as
for
a
man
who
has
passed
through
the
horrors
of
delirium
but
for
me
as
i
stand
before
you
now
i
ask
you
not
to
be
sorry
i
have
come
to
bring
you
if
i
can
dear
judith
a
measure
of
gladness
perhaps
of
she
wrenched
herself
free
from
me
and
a
terrified
cry
of
marcus
checked
my
dithyrambic
appeal
she
shrank
away
so
that
a
great
corner
of
the
separated
us
and
she
stared
at
me
as
though
my
words
hats
been
the
affrighting
utterance
of
a
madman
marcus
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
with
an
unnatural
shrillness
in
her
voice
i
mean
said
i
i
mean
i
mean
that
crushed
by
three
days
pressure
my
three
days
love
lies
time
has
withered
him
at
the
root
i
have
buried
him
deep
in
unconsecrated
ground
like
a
vampire
with
a
stake
through
his
heart
and
i
have
come
back
to
you
judith
humbly
to
crave
your
forgiveness
and
your
love
to
tell
you
i
have
changed
dear
to
offer
you
all
i
have
in
the
world
if
you
will
but
take
it
to
give
you
my
life
my
daily
hourly
devotion
my
god
i
cried
don
t
you
believe
me
she
still
stared
at
me
in
a
frightened
way
leaning
heavier
on
the
table
her
lips
twitched
before
they
could
frame
the
words
yes
i
believe
you
you
have
never
lied
to
then
in
the
name
of
love
and
heaven
i
cried
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
she
trembled
evidently
suppressing
something
with
intense
effort
whether
bitter
laughter
indignation
or
a
passionate
outburst
i
could
not
tell
you
ask
why
she
said
unsteadily
because
you
seem
like
the
angel
of
the
flaming
at
these
astounding
words
it
was
my
turn
to
look
amazed
vengeance
i
echud
what
wrong
have
you
done
me
or
any
living
creature
come
my
dear
and
i
moved
nearer
by
seating
myself
on
the
corner
of
the
table
close
to
the
and
leaning
towards
her
let
us
look
at
this
thing
soberly
if
ever
a
man
had
need
of
woman
i
have
need
of
you
i
can
live
alone
no
longer
we
must
share
one
home
henceforth
together
we
can
snap
our
fingers
at
the
world
you
and
i
if
you
have
anything
to
say
against
the
proposal
let
us
discuss
it
judith
s
slender
figure
vibrated
like
a
cord
strung
to
her
voice
vibrated
yes
let
us
discuss
it
calmly
but
not
here
the
sight
of
you
sitting
in
the
middle
of
my
life
between
the
and
the
is
getting
on
my
nerves
let
us
go
into
the
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
calm
there
her
voice
quavered
in
a
queer
little
choke
of
sabbatical
i
slid
quickly
from
the
table
and
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
tell
me
judith
what
is
amiss
with
she
broke
away
from
me
roughly
thrusting
me
back
nothing
a
woman
s
nothing
if
you
understand
what
that
means
come
into
the
i
opened
the
door
she
passed
out
and
i
followed
her
along
the
passage
she
preceded
me
into
the
and
i
stayed
for
a
moment
to
close
the
door
fumbling
with
the
handle
which
has
been
loose
for
some
months
when
i
turned
and
had
made
a
couple
of
steps
forward
i
halted
involuntarily
under
the
shock
of
a
considerable
surprise
we
were
not
alone
standing
on
the
his
hands
behind
his
back
his
brows
bent
on
me
benevolently
was
a
man
in
clerical
attire
he
looked
ostentatiously
exaggeratedly
clerical
his
clerical
was
of
inordinate
length
his
boots
were
aggravatingly
by
a
very
large
white
tie
masking
the
edges
of
a
collar
he
proclaimed
himself
evangelical
an
otherwise
florid
face
was
adorned
with
brown
growing
rather
long
a
bald
shiny
head
topped
a
fringe
of
brown
hair
i
stared
at
this
unexpected
gentleman
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
recovering
my
looked
enquiringly
at
judith
sir
marcus
she
said
let
me
introduce
my
husband
rupert
her
husband
this
benevolent
evangelical
parson
her
husband
but
the
brilliant
gallant
who
had
dazzled
her
eyes
the
dissolute
scoundrel
that
had
wrecked
her
life
where
was
he
dumfounded
i
managed
to
bow
politely
enough
but
my
stupefaction
was
covered
by
judith
rushing
across
the
room
and
uttering
a
strange
sound
which
resolved
itself
into
a
shrill
hysterical
laugh
as
she
reached
the
door
which
she
opened
and
slammed
behind
her
i
heard
her
scream
hysterically
in
the
passage
then
the
slam
of
another
door
and
the
silence
told
me
that
she
had
shut
herself
in
her
bedroom
disregarding
the
new
husband
s
presence
i
rang
the
bell
and
the
servant
who
had
left
her
kitchen
on
hearing
the
scream
entered
immediately
go
to
your
mistress
she
is
ill
said
i
the
maid
hurriedly
departed
the
parson
and
i
looked
at
one
another
i
am
afraid
said
i
that
my
presence
is
unhappily
an
intrusion
i
hope
to
make
your
better
acquaintance
on
another
oh
please
don
t
go
said
he
my
wife
is
only
a
little
upset
and
will
soon
recover
i
beg
that
you
will
excuse
her
besides
i
should
like
to
have
a
talk
with
he
offered
me
a
chair
my
own
chair
the
comfortable
empire
chair
i
had
given
judith
as
a
birthday
present
years
ago
the
chair
in
which
i
had
invariably
sat
he
did
it
with
the
manner
of
the
master
of
the
house
a
most
courteous
gentleman
the
situation
was
fantastic
some
ingenious
devil
must
have
conceived
it
by
way
of
pandering
to
the
humour
of
the
high
gods
as
i
sat
down
i
rubbed
my
eyes
was
this
clerical
gentleman
real
the
rubbing
of
my
eyes
dispelled
no
hallucination
he
was
flesh
and
blood
and
still
regarded
me
urbanely
it
was
horrible
the
desertion
of
the
scoundrelly
husband
who
i
thought
was
lost
somewhere
in
the
cesspool
of
europe
was
the
basis
the
sanction
of
the
relations
between
judith
and
myself
and
here
was
this
reverend
respectable
man
apologising
for
his
wife
and
begging
me
to
be
seated
in
my
own
chair
the
remark
of
judith
s
that
i
should
find
sabbatical
calm
in
the
occurred
to
me
and
i
had
to
grip
the
arms
of
the
chair
to
prevent
myself
from
joining
judith
in
her
hysterics
the
appearance
of
the
husband
in
his
legendary
colours
of
rascality
would
have
been
a
shock
the
sudden
scattering
of
my
plans
for
judith
s
happiness
i
should
have
viewed
with
consternation
but
it
would
have
been
normal
for
him
however
to
appear
in
the
guise
of
an
evangelical
clergyman
the
very
last
kind
of
individual
to
be
associated
with
judith
was
i
repeat
horribly
fantastic
i
believe
sir
marcus
said
he
deliberately
parting
the
tails
of
his
exaggerated
and
sitting
down
near
me
that
you
are
a
very
great
friend
of
my
i
murmured
that
i
had
known
mainwaring
for
some
years
you
are
doubtless
acquainted
with
her
unhappy
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
it
said
i
you
must
then
share
her
surprise
in
seeing
me
here
i
should
like
to
assure
you
as
representing
her
friends
and
society
and
that
sort
of
thing
as
i
have
assured
her
that
i
have
not
taken
this
step
without
earnest
prayer
and
seeking
the
counsel
of
almighty
i
am
by
no
means
a
bigoted
pietist
but
to
hear
a
person
talk
lightly
about
seeking
the
counsel
of
almighty
god
jars
upon
my
sense
of
taste
i
stiffened
at
the
sanctimonious
tone
in
which
the
words
were
uttered
you
have
without
doubt
very
good
reasons
for
coming
back
into
the
circle
of
her
life
said
i
the
best
of
all
reasons
he
replied
caressing
a
brown
whisker
namely
that
i
am
a
i
liked
him
less
and
less
is
that
the
reason
may
i
ask
why
you
remained
away
from
her
all
these
years
i
deserve
the
scoff
said
he
those
were
days
of
sin
i
deserve
every
humiliation
that
can
be
put
upon
me
but
i
have
since
found
the
grace
of
god
i
found
it
at
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
on
the
eighth
of
january
eighteen
hundred
and
never
mind
the
year
i
interrupted
my
gorge
rose
the
man
was
a
sanctimonious
chadband
he
had
come
with
nefarious
designs
on
judith
s
slender
capital
i
saw
knavery
in
the
whites
of
his
upturned
eyes
i
should
be
glad
i
continued
quickly
if
you
would
come
to
the
point
of
the
conversation
you
desire
to
have
with
me
i
presume
it
concerns
mainwaring
she
has
reconciled
herself
to
circumstances
and
has
found
means
to
regulate
her
life
with
a
certain
measure
of
contentment
and
comfort
until
now
when
you
suddenly
introduce
a
disturbing
factor
you
appear
to
wish
to
tell
me
your
reasons
for
doing
so
and
i
can
t
see
what
the
grace
of
god
has
to
do
with
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shot
out
both
hands
in
the
awkward
gesture
of
an
inspired
english
prophet
but
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
it
is
the
beginning
and
end
core
and
kernel
root
and
branch
of
the
matter
it
is
the
grace
of
god
that
checked
me
in
the
full
career
of
my
wickedness
it
is
the
grace
of
god
that
has
lighted
my
path
ever
since
to
holier
things
it
is
the
grace
of
god
that
has
changed
me
from
what
i
was
to
what
i
am
it
is
the
grace
of
god
that
has
brought
me
here
to
ask
pardon
on
my
knees
of
the
woman
i
have
wronged
the
grace
of
god
and
of
his
son
our
lord
jesus
christ
which
came
upon
me
in
a
great
light
on
that
january
afternoon
even
as
it
did
upon
saul
of
tarsus
the
grace
of
god
has
everything
to
do
with
mr
mainwaring
said
i
such
talk
is
either
blasphemous
or
he
did
not
allow
me
to
state
the
alternative
but
caught
up
the
word
in
a
great
cry
blasphemous
why
man
alive
for
what
are
you
taking
me
do
you
think
this
is
some
unholy
jest
can
t
you
see
that
i
am
in
deadly
earnest
come
and
see
me
where
i
live
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
as
if
he
would
drag
me
away
then
and
there
among
the
poor
in
hoxton
you
scarcely
know
where
hoxton
is
i
didn
t
when
i
was
a
man
of
ease
like
yourself
that
wilderness
of
grey
despair
where
the
sun
of
the
world
scarcely
shines
let
alone
the
light
of
god
come
and
see
for
yourself
man
whether
i
am
lying
then
it
dawned
upon
me
that
the
man
had
been
talking
from
innermost
depths
that
he
was
almost
terrifyingly
sincere
i
must
ask
you
to
pardon
me
said
i
for
appearing
to
doubt
your
good
faith
you
must
attribute
it
to
my
entire
unfamiliarity
with
the
terms
of
evangelical
he
looked
at
me
queerly
for
a
moment
and
then
in
the
quiet
tones
of
a
man
of
the
world
said
smiling
pleasantly
very
many
years
ago
i
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
your
grandfather
the
late
baronet
may
i
say
that
you
remind
me
of
him
i
have
never
heard
an
apology
more
gracefully
and
tactfully
accepted
for
an
unregenerate
second
he
had
become
the
gallant
rupert
mainwaring
again
and
showed
me
wherein
might
lie
his
attraction
pray
be
seated
said
he
more
gravely
and
allow
me
to
he
unfolded
his
story
it
was
well
said
he
that
an
outsider
i
an
outsider
in
that
familiar
room
should
hear
it
i
was
at
liberty
to
make
it
public
indeed
publicity
was
what
he
earnestly
craved
as
far
as
my
memory
serves
me
for
my
wits
were
whirling
as
i
listened
the
following
is
an
epitome
of
his
narrative
he
had
been
a
man
of
sin
not
only
in
the
vague
ecclesiastical
sense
but
in
downright
practical
earnest
he
had
committed
every
imaginable
crime
save
the
odd
few
that
lead
to
penal
servitude
and
the
gallows
he
drank
he
betrayed
women
he
cheated
at
cards
he
had
an
evil
reputation
on
the
turf
his
companions
were
chosen
from
the
harlotry
and
knavery
of
the
civilised
world
he
had
lured
judith
from
her
first
husband
thus
breaking
his
heart
poor
man
so
that
he
died
soon
after
he
had
married
judith
and
had
deserted
her
for
a
barmaid
whom
in
her
turn
he
had
abandoned
he
wallowed
to
use
his
own
expression
in
the
trough
of
iniquity
he
was
as
i
had
always
understood
about
as
choice
a
blackguard
as
it
would
be
possible
to
meet
outside
a
gaol
one
day
a
pretty
girl
whom
he
had
been
following
in
the
street
unwittingly
enticed
him
into
a
revivalist
meeting
he
described
that
meeting
so
vividly
that
had
my
stupefied
mind
been
capable
of
fresh
emotions
i
too
might
have
been
converted
at
second
hand
by
the
revivalist
preacher
he
repeated
parts
of
the
sermon
rose
to
his
feet
waved
his
arms
thundered
out
the
commonplaces
of
salvation
army
christianity
as
if
he
had
made
an
amazing
theological
discovery
it
was
pathetic
it
was
ludicrous
it
was
also
inconceivably
painful
at
last
he
mopped
his
forehead
and
shiny
head
before
that
meeting
was
over
i
was
on
my
knees
praying
beside
the
girl
whom
i
had
designed
to
ruin
i
went
into
the
streets
a
converted
man
filled
with
the
grace
of
god
i
resolved
to
devote
my
life
to
saving
souls
for
christ
my
old
habits
of
sin
fell
away
from
me
like
a
garment
i
studied
for
the
ministry
i
am
now
in
deacon
s
orders
and
i
am
the
incumbent
of
a
little
tin
mission
church
in
hoxton
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
sir
he
is
generally
credited
with
doing
so
said
i
stupidly
you
are
doubtless
wondering
sir
marcus
he
went
on
why
i
placed
such
a
long
interval
between
my
awakening
and
my
communicating
with
my
wife
i
set
myself
a
period
of
probation
i
desired
to
be
assured
of
god
s
will
it
was
essential
that
i
should
test
my
strength
of
purpose
and
my
power
of
making
a
life
s
atonement
as
far
as
the
things
of
this
world
are
concerned
for
the
wrongs
i
have
inflicted
on
her
i
have
come
now
to
offer
her
a
christian
i
looked
at
him
do
you
expect
judith
to
go
and
live
with
you
as
your
wife
in
hoxton
i
asked
bluntly
why
not
she
is
my
i
rose
and
walked
about
the
room
in
agitation
somehow
such
a
contingency
had
not
entered
my
bewildered
head
why
not
sir
marcus
he
repeated
because
judith
isn
t
that
kind
of
woman
at
all
i
said
desperately
she
doesn
t
like
hoxton
and
would
be
as
much
out
of
place
in
a
church
as
i
should
be
in
a
cavalry
god
will
see
to
her
fitness
said
he
gravely
to
him
all
things
are
but
she
has
considerable
philosophic
doubt
as
to
his
personal
existence
i
cried
he
smiled
prophetically
and
waved
away
her
doubt
with
a
gesture
i
have
no
fears
on
that
score
he
observed
but
it
is
preposterous
i
objected
once
more
changing
my
ground
judith
craves
the
arrears
of
gaiety
and
laughter
which
your
conduct
caused
life
to
leave
owing
to
her
she
loves
bright
dresses
cigarettes
and
wine
and
the
things
that
are
anathema
in
an
evangelical
my
wife
will
find
the
gaiety
and
laughter
of
holiness
replied
the
fanatic
she
will
not
be
stinted
of
money
to
dress
herself
with
becoming
modesty
and
as
for
alcohol
and
tobacco
no
one
knows
better
than
myself
how
easy
it
is
to
give
them
you
seem
as
merciless
in
your
virtues
as
you
were
in
your
vices
said
i
i
have
to
bring
souls
to
christ
he
answered
that
doesn
t
appear
to
be
the
way
i
retorted
to
bring
pray
remember
sir
marcus
said
he
bending
his
brows
upon
me
that
i
did
not
ask
you
for
suggestions
as
to
the
conduct
of
my
the
general
methods
you
adopt
in
the
case
of
your
congregation
said
i
are
matters
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
but
i
can
not
see
judith
imprisoned
for
life
in
a
tin
church
without
a
protest
your
proposal
reminds
me
of
the
siennese
who
owed
a
victorious
general
more
than
they
could
possibly
repay
the
legend
goes
that
they
hanged
him
in
order
to
make
him
a
saint
after
his
death
by
way
of
reward
i
object
to
this
sort
of
canonisation
of
judith
and
she
will
object
too
you
seem
to
leave
her
out
of
account
altogether
she
is
mistress
of
her
own
actions
she
has
a
will
of
her
own
she
is
not
going
to
give
up
her
comfortable
flat
off
the
tottenham
court
road
in
order
to
dwell
in
hoxton
she
won

go

he
smiled
indulgently
and
held
out
his
hand
to
signify
that
the
interview
was
over
she
will
sir
was
there
ever
such
a
torquemada
of
a
creature
i
respect
religion
i
respect
this
man
s
intense
conviction
of
the
reality
of
his
conversion
i
can
respect
even
the
long
frock
coat
and
the
long
brown
whiskers
which
in
the
case
of
so
dashing
a
worldling
as
rupert
mainwaring
were
a
deliberate
and
daily
mortification
of
the
flesh
but
i
hold
in
shuddering
detestation
the
and
the
rack
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
which
he
cheerfully
contemplated
applying
to
judith
why
on
earth
can
t
you
let
the
poor
woman
alone
i
asked
ignoring
his
hand
i
am
doing
my
duty
to
god
and
to
her
said
he
with
the
result
that
you
have
driven
her
into
she
ll
get
over
them
said
he
i
wish
you
said
i
we
might
talk
together
for
a
thousand
years
without
understanding
each
pardon
me
he
retorted
with
the
utmost
urbanity
i
understand
you
he
accompanied
me
to
the
where
i
had
left
my
hat
and
umbrella
and
to
the
flat
door
which
he
politely
opened
when
it
shut
behind
me
i
felt
inclined
to
batter
it
open
again
and
to
take
judith
by
main
force
from
under
his
nose
but
i
suppose
i
am
pusillanimous
i
found
myself
in
the
street
brandishing
my
umbrella
like
a
flaming
sword
and
vowing
to
perform
all
sorts
of
paladin
exploits
which
i
knew
in
my
heart
were
futile
i
hailed
an
omnibus
in
the
tottenham
court
road
and
clambered
to
the
top
though
a
slight
drizzle
was
falling
why
i
did
it
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
for
i
abhor
those
locomotive
engines
of
exquisite
discomfort
i
had
no
preconceived
notion
of
destination
it
was
a
moving
thing
that
would
carry
me
away
from
the
tottenham
court
road
away
from
the
rev
rupert
mainwaring
away
from
myself
i
was
the
solitary
occupant
of
the
omnibus
roof
the
rain
fell
softly
persistently
soakingly
i
laughed
aloud
i
recognised
the
predestined
irony
of
things
that
at
every
corner
checks
the
course
of
the
ineffectual
man
chapter
xx
november
i
wrote
judith
a
long
letter
last
night
urging
her
to
disregard
the
forfeited
claims
of
her
husband
and
to
join
her
life
definitely
with
mine
i
was
cynical
enough
to
feel
that
if
such
a
proceeding
annoyed
the
rev
rupert
mainwaring
it
would
serve
him
right
the
fact
of
a
man
s
finding
religion
and
abjuring
sack
does
not
in
itself
exculpate
him
from
wrongs
which
he
has
inflicted
on
his
in
unregenerate
days
mainwaring
deserved
some
punishment
of
which
he
seemed
to
have
had
remarkably
little
for
mind
you
his
and
ashes
at
hoxton
although
sincerely
worn
are
not
much
of
a
punishment
to
a
man
in
his
exalted
mood
now
on
the
contrary
judith
deserved
compensation
such
as
i
alone
was
prepared
to
offer
her
in
spite
of
conventional
morality
and
the
feelings
of
the
rev
rupert
mainwaring
indeed
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
way
of
saving
judith
from
being
worried
out
of
her
life
by
frantic
appeals
to
embrace
both
himself
and
primitive
christianity
her
position
was
that
of
andromeda
mine
that
of
an
unheroic
perseus
destined
to
deliver
her
from
the
monster
the
monster
whose
lair
is
a
little
tin
mission
church
in
hoxton
i
wrote
the
letter
in
one
of
those
periods
of
when
the
pulses
of
emotion
throb
weakly
and
sensitiveness
is
dulled
i
have
felt
differently
my
nerves
have
been
restrung
something
ironically
vulgar
sordidly
tragic
has
seemed
to
creep
into
my
relations
with
judith
to
my
great
surprise
judith
brought
her
answer
in
person
this
evening
it
is
the
first
time
she
has
entered
my
house
and
her
first
words
as
she
looked
all
around
her
with
a
wistful
smile
referred
to
the
fact
it
is
almost
just
as
i
have
pictured
it
and
i
have
pictured
it
do
you
know
how
often
she
was
calmer
if
not
happier
the
haggard
expression
had
given
place
to
one
of
resignation
i
wheeled
an
close
to
the
fire
for
she
was
cold
and
she
sank
into
it
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
i
knelt
beside
her
she
drew
off
her
gloves
and
put
one
hand
on
my
head
in
the
old
way
the
touch
brought
me
great
comfort
i
thought
that
we
had
reached
the
quiet
haven
at
last
so
you
have
come
to
me
judith
i
whispered
i
have
come
dear
she
said
to
tell
you
that
i
can
t
my
heart
sank
why
i
asked
we
fenced
a
little
she
gave
half
reasons
womanlike
of
which
i
proved
the
inadequacy
i
recapitulated
the
arguments
i
had
used
in
my
letter
she
met
them
with
hints
and
vague
allusions
at
last
she
cut
the
knot
i
am
going
back
to
my
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
echud
the
words
she
repeated
them
in
a
tone
so
mournfully
distinct
that
they
had
the
finality
of
a
i
had
nothing
to
say
before
we
part
i
must
make
my
peace
with
you
marcus
she
said
i
have
suddenly
developed
a
conscience
i
always
had
the
germs
of
you
were
always
the
best
and
dearest
woman
in
the
world
i
cried
and
i
betrayed
you
dear
that
letter
from
pasquale
told
me
about
his
flight
with
carlotta
i
lied
to
you
but
i
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
i
rested
my
elbow
on
the
and
looked
down
on
her
she
appeared
so
sweet
and
fragile
like
a
piece
of
dresden
china
incapable
of
base
actions
as
i
did
not
speak
she
went
on
i
did
not
mean
to
play
into
pasquale
s
hands
marcus
heaven
knows
i
didn
t
but
i
did
play
into
them
do
you
remember
that
awful
night
and
our
talk
the
next
morning
i
asked
you
not
to
see
her
all
day
to
mourn
our
dead
love
i
knew
you
would
keep
your
promise
you
are
a
man
of
sensitive
honour
if
all
men
were
like
you
the
world
would
be
a
beautiful
it
would
go
to
smash
in
a
few
weeks
through
universal
incompetence
i
murmured
with
some
bitterness
there
would
be
no
meanness
and
treachery
and
despicable
underhand
doings
marcus
you
must
forgive
me
i
was
a
desperate
woman
fighting
for
my
life
s
happiness
i
thought
i
would
try
one
forlorn
hope
i
kept
you
out
of
the
way
and
came
up
here
to
see
carlotta
don
t
interrupt
me
marcus
let
me
finish
i
happened
to
meet
her
a
hundred
yards
down
the
road
and
we
went
into
the
regent
s
park
we
sat
down
and
i
told
her
about
ourselves
and
my
love
for
you
and
asked
her
to
give
you
up
i
don
t
believe
she
understood
marcus
she
laughed
and
threw
stones
at
a
little
dog
i
recovered
my
senses
and
left
her
there
and
went
home
sick
with
shame
and
humiliation
i
knew
pasquale
was
in
love
with
her
for
he
had
told
me
so
the
night
before
and
asked
me
how
the
marriage
could
be
stopped
he
didn
t
believe
in
your
announcement
to
hamdi
effendi
but
i
never
mentioned
pasquale
to
carlotta
or
hinted
there
might
be
another
than
you
i
was
loyal
so
far
marcus
and
two
or
three
days
afterwards
came
pasquale
s
letter
and
i
waited
for
you
in
a
fearful
joy
i
knew
you
would
come
to
me
and
i
was
mad
enough
to
think
that
time
would
heal
that
you
would
forget
that
we
could
have
the
dear
past
again
and
i
would
teach
you
to
love
me
but
then
suddenly
without
a
word
of
warning
it
has
always
been
his
way
appeared
my
husband
after
that
you
came
with
your
offer
of
shelter
and
comfort
and
you
seemed
like
the
angel
of
the
flaming
vengeance
for
i
had
wronged
you
dear
robbed
you
of
your
happiness
if
i
hadn
t
prepared
her
mind
for
leaving
you
she
would
never
have
run
away
if
i
had
not
done
this
or
if
on
the
other
hand
you
loved
me
marcus
i
should
perhaps
have
looked
at
things
differently
i
am
beginning
to
believe
in
god
and
to
see
his
hand
in
it
all
i
couldn
t
come
and
live
with
you
as
your
wife
marcus
things
stronger
even
than
my
love
for
you
forbid
it
our
life
together
would
not
be
the
sweet
and
gracious
thing
it
has
always
been
to
me
we
have
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
i
must
follow
my
i
knew
she
spoke
rightly
when
she
is
not
swept
away
to
hysterical
action
by
her
temperament
she
has
a
perception
exquisitely
keen
into
the
heart
of
truth
the
parting
of
the
ways
said
i
yes
but
can
t
you
rest
at
the
can
t
you
lead
your
present
life
your
husband
and
myself
both
just
your
friends
rupert
has
need
of
me
she
replied
very
quickly
he
is
a
man
in
torment
of
soul
he
has
gone
to
this
extreme
of
religious
fanaticism
because
he
is
still
uncertain
of
himself
we
had
another
long
talk
i
may
help
does
he
deserve
the
sacrifice
of
your
life
she
did
not
take
up
my
question
directly
but
sat
for
a
few
minutes
with
her
chin
on
her
hand
looking
into
the
fire
he
is
a
man
of
evil
passions
she
resumed
at
last
drink
and
women
mainly
dragged
him
down
i
knew
the
hell
of
it
during
the
short
time
of
our
married
life
if
he
falls
away
now
he
believes
he
is
damned
to
all
eternity
he
believes
in
the
material
torture
flames
and
devils
and
pitchforks
of
damned
souls
he
says
in
me
alone
lies
his
salvation
i
must
go
if
the
tin
church
gets
too
awful
i
shall
run
over
to
delphine
carrere
for
a
week
to
steady
my
what
could
i
say
the
abomination
of
desolation
lay
around
about
me
i
might
have
prated
to
her
of
my
needs
wrung
her
heart
with
the
piteousness
of
my
appeal
bono
can
t
whine
to
women
or
to
men
either
for
the
matter
of
that
when
i
am
by
myself
i
can
curse
and
swear
play
termagant
and
rehearse
an
extravaganza
all
the
herods
that
ever
heroded
but
before
others
no
i
believe
my
before
he
qualified
for
his
baronetcy
was
a
gentleman
but
on
these
occasions
said
i
you
will
avoid
a
sequestered
and
meditative
her
laugh
got
choked
by
a
sob
do
you
remember
that
it
is
not
so
long
ago
and
yet
it
seems
many
many
we
moralised
generally
after
the
way
of
humans
who
desire
to
postpone
a
moment
of
anguished
speech
she
made
the
tour
of
my
many
of
the
books
she
had
borrowed
and
she
recognised
them
as
old
friends
is
that
where
benvenuto
cellini
has
always
lived
yes
said
i
running
my
hand
along
the
row
he
is
in
his
century
among
his
companions
he
would
be
unhappy
anywhere
and
the
history
how
far
has
it
gone
i
showed
her
the
pile
of
finished
manuscript
of
which
she
glanced
at
a
few
pages
she
put
it
down
hurriedly
and
turned
away
i
can
t
see
to
read
just
now
then
she
paused
in
front
of
her
own
photograph
the
only
one
now
on
the
will
you
give
me
that
back
why
should
i
i
asked
i
would
rather
i
should
not
like
you
to
burn
burn
it
all
i
have
left
of
you
she
turned
swimming
eyes
on
me
you
are
good
marcus
after
what
i
have
told
you
you
do
not
feel
bitterly
against
me
for
what
for
being
quixotic
for
going
to
martyrdom
for
an
ideal
you
did
not
listen
when
i
spoke
about
carlotta
oh
my
dear
said
i
and
now
she
has
gone
we
kissed
at
parting
a
kiss
of
remembrance
and
renunciation
shall
we
ever
meet
again
darkness
gathers
round
me
and
i
am
tired
tired
and
i
would
that
i
could
sleep
like
rip
van
winkle
and
awake
an
old
man
with
an
old
man
s
passionless
resignation
or
better
awake
not
at
all
such
poor
fools
as
i
are
better
dead
i
look
back
and
see
all
my
philosophy
refuted
all
my
prim
little
opinions
lying
prone
like
dolls
with
the
sawdust
knocked
out
of
them
all
these
years
i
have
been
judging
judith
with
an
ignorance
as
cruel
as
it
has
been
complacent
verily
i
have
been
the
fag
end
of
wisdom
so
i
forbear
to
judge
her
now
if
i
had
loved
judith
with
the
great
passion
of
a
man
s
love
for
woman
not
all
the
converted
rascals
in
christendom
could
have
come
between
us
and
her
seeing
carlotta
poor
woman
what
does
it
matter
what
did
she
say
about
carlotta
she
laughed
and
threw
stones
at
a
little
oh
my
god
november
this
way
madness
lies
i
will
leave
the
house
in
charge
of
stenson
and
antoinette
and
go
abroad
something
has
put
verona
into
my
head
one
place
is
as
good
as
another
so
long
as
it
is
not
this
house
this
house
of
death
and
madness
and
crime
and
verona
is
in
italy
where
i
have
always
found
peace
i
will
confess
my
madness
this
book
is
a
record
of
my
morals
the
finished
version
of
the
farce
the
high
gods
have
called
on
meto
play
i
thought
last
night
the
curtain
was
rung
down
i
was
wrong
listen
and
laugh
as
i
do
if
you
can
i
fixed
myself
to
work
after
all
i
am
not
an
idler
i
earn
my
right
to
live
when
i
publish
my
history
the
world
will
be
the
richer
by
poor
though
it
may
be
i
vow
i
have
been
more
greatly
more
nobly
employed
of
late
years
than
i
was
when
i
earned
my
living
at
teaching
to
children
the
most
useless
the
most
disastrous
the
most
branch
of
knowledge
wherewith
pedagogues
in
their
insensate
folly
have
crippled
the
minds
and
blasted
the
lives
of
thousands
of
their
elementary
mathematics
there
is
no
more
reason
for
any
human
being
on
god
s
earth
to
be
acquainted
with
the
binomial
theorem
or
the
solution
of
triangles
unless
he
is
a
professional
scientist
when
he
can
begin
to
specialise
in
mathematics
at
the
same
age
as
the
lawyer
begins
to
specialise
in
law
or
the
surgeon
in
anatomy
than
for
him
to
be
an
expert
in
choctaw
the
cabala
or
the
book
of
mormon
i
look
back
with
feelings
of
shame
and
degradation
to
the
days
when
for
the
sake
of
a
crust
of
bread
i
prostituted
my
intelligence
to
wasting
the
precious
hours
of
impressionable
childhood
which
could
have
been
filled
with
so
many
beautiful
and
meaningful
things
over
this
utterly
futile
and
inhuman
subject
it
trains
the
mind
it
teaches
boys
to
think
they
say
it
doesn
t
in
reality
it
is
a
cut
and
dried
subject
easy
to
fit
into
a
school
curriculum
its
sacrosanctity
saves
educationalists
an
enormous
amount
of
trouble
and
its
chief
use
is
to
enable
mindless
young
men
from
the
universities
to
make
a
dishonest
living
by
teaching
it
to
others
who
in
their
turn
may
teach
it
to
a
future
generation
i
am
mad
why
have
i
indulged
in
this
diatribe
against
mathematics
i
must
find
some
vent
i
suppose
i
see
now
i
was
saying
that
i
earned
my
right
to
live
that
i
am
not
an
idler
i
cling
strenuously
to
the
claim
a
man
can
not
command
respect
even
his
own
by
the
mere
reason
of
his
and
after
what
i
have
done
i
must
force
my
claim
to
the
respect
which
on
other
grounds
i
have
forfeited
i
spent
then
my
day
in
unremitting
toil
but
this
evening
the
horrible
craving
for
her
came
over
me
such
a
little
thing
brought
it
about
antoinette
who
disapproves
of
the
amorphous
british
lumps
of
sugar
has
found
some
emporium
where
she
can
buy
the
regular
parallelopiped
of
the
continent
and
these
she
provides
for
my
afterdinner
coffee
i
dipped
the
edge
of
the
piece
of
sugar
into
the
liquid
before
dropping
it
and
watched
the
brown
moisture
rise
through
the
white
crystals
then
i
remembered
it
was
an
invariable
practice
of
carlotta
s
she
would
keep
the
lump
in
the
coffee
to
between
her
fingers
and
then
hastily
put
it
into
her
mouth
so
that
it
should
not
crumble
to
pieces
on
the
way
if
it
did
there
would
be
much
laughter
and
wiping
of
skirts
and
there
would
be
a
search
through
my
pockets
for
a
handkerchief
to
dry
the
pink
tips
of
her
fingers
she
called
the
dripping
lump
a
canard
like
the
french
children
it
was
such
a
trivial
thing
but
it
brought
back
with
a
rush
all
the
thousand
dainty
foolish
captivating
intimacies
that
made
up
the
maddening
charm
of
carlotta
yes
i
am
aware
that
there
is
no
language
spoken
under
heaven
that
can
fitly
express
the
doting
folly
of
a
man
who
can
be
driven
mad
by
a
piece
of
sugar
soaked
in
coffee
there
is
a
ghastly
french
phrase
not
to
be
found
in
lamartine
chateaubriand
or
any
of
the
polite
sentimentalists
les
sangs
tournes
de
quelqu
it
is
so
with
me
ai
les
sangs
tournes
d
somebody
has
said
something
somewhere
about
the
passion
of
a
man
of
forty
it
must
have
to
do
with
the
french
phrase
i
pushed
my
coffee
aside
untasted
and
buried
my
head
in
my
hands
longing
longing
eating
my
heart
out
for
her
the
hours
passed
when
the
servants
were
abed
i
stole
upstairs
to
her
room
left
as
it
was
on
the
night
when
antoinette
hoping
against
hope
had
prepared
it
for
her
reception
i
broke
down
heaven
knows
what
i
did
i
returned
to
the
filled
with
the
blind
rage
that
makes
a
man
curse
god
and
wish
that
he
could
die
the
fire
was
black
and
i
mechanically
took
up
the
poker
to
stir
it
a
tempest
of
impotent
anger
shook
my
soul
i
saw
things
red
before
my
eyes
i
had
an
execrable
lust
to
kill
i
was
alone
amid
a
multitude
of
gibbering
fiends
as
i
stooped
before
the
grate
i
felt
something
scrabble
my
shoulders
i
leapt
back
with
a
shriek
and
saw
standing
on
the
a
black
thing
regarding
me
with
an
expression
of
infinite
malice
before
i
knew
what
i
had
done
i
had
brought
the
iron
down
with
all
my
force
upon
its
skull
and
it
had
fallen
dead
at
my
feet
coronat
november
verona
i
have
abandoned
the
history
of
renaissance
the
dog
and
the
dusty
pile
of
notes
i
have
shot
into
a
lumber
heap
in
a
corner
of
this
room
where
i
sit
and
shiver
by
a
little
stove
it
is
immense
marble
cold
comfortless
suggestive
of
the
vasty
halls
of
i
have
been
here
a
week
i
thought
i
should
find
rest
i
should
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
italy
again
i
should
ease
my
heart
among
the
masterworks
of
girolamo
dai
libri
and
cavazzola
and
in
the
presence
of
the
blue
castellated
mountains
they
loved
to
paint
my
spirit
would
even
be
as
theirs
in
this
city
i
fondly
imagined
i
should
forget
the
regent
s
park
and
attune
my
mind
to
the
life
that
once
filled
its
narrow
streets
but
nothing
have
i
found
save
solitude
i
stood
before
the
mutilated
fresco
of
morone
my
rapture
of
six
years
ago
and
hated
it
with
unreasoning
hatred
the
madonna
belied
the
inscription
above
her
head
miseratrix
virginum
regina
nostri
miserere
and
greeted
me
with
a
pitiless
simper
the
unidentified
martyr
on
the
left
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
with
callous
indifference
and
roch
looked
aggravatingly
plump
for
all
his
ostentatious
the
picture
was
worse
than
meaningless
it
was
insulting
it
drove
me
out
of
the
public
gallery
outside
a
grey
mist
veiled
the
hills
and
a
fine
penetrating
rain
was
falling
i
crept
home
and
for
the
fiftieth
time
since
i
have
been
here
opened
my
history
of
renaissance
i
threw
it
with
a
final
curse
into
the
corner
i
loathe
it
i
care
not
a
fig
for
the
renaissance
or
its
morals
i
count
its
people
but
a
pestilent
herd
of
daubers
rhymers
cutthroats
and
courtesans
their
has
lost
its
glamour
of
beauty
and
has
coarsened
into
vulgar
insolence
they
offend
me
by
their
riotous
swagger
their
insistence
on
the
animal
joy
of
living
chiefly
by
their
perpetual
reminiscence
of
pasquale
yet
once
they
interested
me
greatly
filling
with
music
and
with
colour
the
grey
void
of
my
life
whence
has
come
the
change
in
myself
to
myself
i
have
become
a
subject
of
excruciating
interest
to
myself
i
am
a
vastly
more
picturesque
personage
than
any
debonair
hooligan
of
verona
he
has
faded
into
the
dullest
and
most
offensive
dog
of
a
ghost
i
only
exist
this
sounds
like
the
colossal
vanity
of
bedlam
heaven
knows
it
is
not
if
you
are
racked
with
toothache
from
ear
to
ear
from
crown
to
chin
and
from
eyeball
to
cerebellum
is
not
the
whole
universe
concentrated
in
that
head
of
yours
are
you
not
to
yourself
in
that
hour
of
torture
the
most
vitally
important
of
created
beings
and
no
one
blames
you
for
it
let
me
therefore
be
without
blame
in
my
hour
of
moral
toothache
in
the
days
gone
by
i
was
the
victim
of
a
singular
hallucination
i
flattered
myself
on
being
the
one
individual
in
the
world
not
summoned
to
play
his
part
in
the
comedy
of
life
i
sat
alone
in
the
great
auditorium
like
the
mad
king
of
bavaria
watching
with
little
zest
what
seemed
but
a
sorry
spectacle
i
thought
myself
secure
in
my
solitary
stall
but
i
had
not
counted
on
the
high
gods
who
crowd
shadowy
into
the
silent
seats
and
are
jealous
of
a
mortal
in
their
midst
without
warning
was
i
wrested
from
my
place
hurled
onto
the
stage
and
before
my
dazzled
eyes
could
accustom
themselves
to
the
footlights
i
found
myself
enmeshed
in
intolerable
drama
i
was
unprepared
i
knew
my
part
imperfectly
i
missed
my
cues
i
had
the
blighting
of
the
amateur
and
yet
the
idiot
mummery
was
intensely
real
amid
the
laughter
of
the
silent
shadowy
gods
i
thought
to
flee
from
the
stage
i
came
to
verona
and
find
i
am
still
acting
my
part
i
have
always
been
acting
i
have
been
acting
since
i
was
born
the
reason
of
our
being
is
to
amuse
the
high
gods
with
our
histrionics
the
earth
itself
is
the
stage
and
the
starry
ether
the
infinite
auditorium
the
high
gods
have
granted
to
their
troupe
of
mimes
one
boon
each
has
it
in
his
power
to
make
the
final
exit
at
any
moment
for
myself
i
feel
that
moment
is
at
hand
one
last
soliloquy
and
then
like
the
pagliacco
i
can
say
with
a
sigh
la
commedia
e
the
play
is
played
out
and
the
rest
will
be
silence
at
all
events
i
will
tell
my
own
story
my
history
of
renaissance
morals
can
lie
in
its
corner
and
rot
whilst
i
shall
concern
myself
with
a
far
more
vital
theme
the
morals
of
marcus
ordeyne
the
rough
entries
in
my
diary
have
been
a
habit
of
many
futile
years
but
they
have
never
sufficed
for
i
have
not
needed
it
till
now
but
now
with
judith
and
carlotta
gone
from
me
my
one
friend
pasquale
cut
for
ever
from
my
life
even
the
sympathetic
polyphemus
driven
into
eternity
by
my
murderous
hand
i
feel
the
irresistible
craving
to
express
myself
fully
and
finally
for
the
first
and
last
time
of
my
life
it
will
be
my
swan
song
what
becomes
of
it
afterwards
i
care
not
and
when
the
last
word
is
written
i
shall
go
to
the
pinacoteca
and
stand
again
before
the
morone
fresco
and
if
the
virginum
still
simpers
at
me
i
shall
take
it
as
a
sign
and
a
token
i
shall
return
to
this
marble
cavern
and
make
my
final
exit
it
will
be
theatrically
artistic
that
i
vow
and
declare
which
no
doubt
will
afford
immense
pleasure
to
the
high
gods
in
their
gallery
part
ii
chapter
xxi
it
is
some
two
years
since
i
stood
for
the
second
time
in
the
pinacoteca
of
verona
and
sought
to
read
my
fate
in
the
simpering
countenance
of
morone
s
virginum
i
met
what
might
have
been
expected
by
a
person
of
any
sense
the
expression
on
the
painted
face
as
i
had
angrily
found
there
two
months
before
when
i
began
to
write
the
foregoing
pages
but
as
i
had
no
sense
at
all
in
those
days
i
accepted
the
poor
battered
madonna
s
lack
of
sympathy
for
a
sign
and
a
token
went
home
and
prepared
for
dissolution
two
years
ago
it
is
only
for
the
last
few
months
that
i
have
been
able
to
look
back
on
that
nightmare
of
a
time
in
verona
with
philosophic
equanimity
and
this
morning
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
i
have
felt
that
dispassionate
attitude
towards
a
past
self
which
enables
a
man
to
set
down
without
the
heartache
the
memories
of
days
that
are
gone
i
sit
upon
the
flat
roof
of
this
house
in
mogador
on
the
morocco
coast
shaded
by
an
awning
from
the
bright
african
sun
which
glints
in
myriad
sparkles
on
the
sea
visible
beyond
the
the
atmosphere
last
night
was
somewhat
heavy
with
the
languorous
indescribable
and
unforgettable
smell
of
the
east
but
the
morning
is
deliciously
by
the
atlantic
breeze
and
the
air
tastes
sweet
and
it
is
clear
dazzlingly
clear
the
white
square
houses
and
the
cupolas
of
the
mosques
stand
out
sharp
against
a
sky
of
intense
ungradated
blue
i
am
away
from
the
centre
of
the
busy
and
the
noise
of
its
streets
thronged
with
camels
and
shouting
drivers
and
picturesque
quarrelling
squabbling
haggling
moors
and
jews
and
desert
arabs
and
i
am
enveloped
in
the
peace
of
the
infinite
azure
besides
yesterday
afternoon
as
i
rode
back
to
mogador
across
the
tongue
of
desert
which
separates
it
from
the
palm
tree
house
and
the
town
rose
on
the
horizon
a
dream
city
of
pure
snow
set
in
the
clear
sunset
amethyst
against
the
still
pale
lapis
lazuli
of
the
bay
something
happened
and
yesterday
evening
more
happened
still
two
years
ago
then
i
faced
in
verona
the
dissolution
of
my
ineffectual
existence
i
could
see
no
reason
for
living
my
theory
of
myself
in
my
relation
to
the
cosmos
had
been
upset
by
practical
phenomena
no
other
theory
based
on
surer
grounds
presented
itself
but
what
about
life
said
i
without
a
theory
already
it
was
life
without
a
purpose
without
work
without
friends
without
judith
and
without
carlotta
i
could
not
endure
it
without
even
a
theory
to
console
me
beings
do
exist
devoid
of
loves
or
theories
but
of
such
i
thought
are
the
beasts
that
perish
i
reflected
further
supposing
on
extended
investigation
i
found
a
new
theory
how
far
would
it
profit
me
how
far
could
i
trust
it
not
to
lead
me
through
another
series
of
fantastic
emotions
and
futile
endeavours
to
the
sublime
climax
of
murdering
a
cat
and
contempt
smote
me
as
i
thought
of
poor
polyphemus
stretched
dead
on
the
hearthrug
and
myself
standing
over
him
sane
stupid
and
remorseful
with
the
poker
in
my
hand
i
walked
up
and
down
the
vast
cold
room
of
the
marble
palazzo
arraying
before
me
in
overwhelming
numbers
the
arguments
for
selfdestruction
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
phial
of
prussic
acid
which
i
had
procured
long
before
in
london
it
being
a
conviction
of
mine
that
every
man
ought
to
have
ready
to
hand
a
sure
means
of
exit
from
the
world
i
paused
many
times
in
front
of
the
little
blue
phial
one
lift
of
the
hand
one
toss
of
the
head
and
all
would
be
over
at
last
i
extracted
the
cork
and
the
faint
smell
of
almonds
reached
my
nostrils
i
recorked
the
phial
and
lit
a
cigarette
this
i
threw
away
half
smoked
and
again
approached
the
table
of
death
i
began
to
feel
a
strong
natural
disinclination
to
swallow
the
stuff
this
said
i
is
sheer
animal
i
again
uncorked
the
phial
a
new
phase
of
the
matter
appeared
to
me
it
is
the
act
of
a
craven
to
shirk
the
responsibilities
of
life
can
you
be
such
a
meanspirited
creature
as
not
even
to
have
the
courage
to
live
no
said
i
i
have
a
valiant
spirit
and
i
set
down
the
bottle
bah
whispered
the
familiar
imp
of
suicide
at
my
elbow
you
are
just
afraid
to
i
took
up
the
bottle
again
but
the
other
taunter
had
an
argument
equally
strong
and
once
more
i
put
the
phial
uncorked
on
the
table
thus
between
two
cowardices
one
of
which
i
must
choose
stood
i
like
the
ass
of
buridan
i
lit
another
cigarette
and
excogitated
the
problem
i
smoked
two
cigarettes
walking
up
and
down
that
vast
chill
apartment
while
the
air
grew
sickly
sweet
with
the
smell
of
almonds
which
intensified
the
physical
repugnance
the
first
faint
odour
had
occasioned
i
began
to
shiver
with
cold
the
stove
had
burned
out
before
i
entered
and
i
had
not
considered
it
worth
while
to
have
it
filled
for
the
few
minutes
that
would
remain
to
me
to
live
i
had
not
reckoned
on
the
ass
s
bundles
of
cowardice
i
may
as
well
be
warm
thought
i
while
i
prove
to
my
complete
satisfaction
that
it
is
more
cowardly
to
live
than
to
die
there
is
no
very
great
i
caught
up
a
with
which
i
had
tried
to
soften
the
asperities
of
an
imitation
louis
xv
couch
and
throwing
it
over
my
shoulders
resumed
my
pilgrimage
i
soon
lost
myself
in
the
problem
and
did
not
notice
a
corner
of
the
rug
gradually
slipping
down
towards
the
floor
i
ll
do
it
i
cried
at
last
making
a
sudden
dive
towards
the
table
but
the
ironical
corner
of
the
rug
had
reached
the
ground
i
stepped
on
it
tripped
and
instinctively
caught
the
table
to
steady
myself
the
table
a
rickety
gueridon
overbalanced
and
away
rolled
my
uncorked
phial
of
prussic
acid
and
fell
into
a
hundred
pieces
on
the
tessellated
floor
said
i
grimly
looking
back
now
i
am
inclined
to
treat
myself
tenderly
whether
i
should
have
drunk
the
poison
if
the
accident
had
not
occurred
i
can
not
say
at
the
moment
of
my
rush
i
intended
to
do
so
after
the
catastrophe
which
i
attributed
to
the
curse
of
ineffectuality
that
pursued
me
i
must
confess
that
i
was
glad
not
that
life
looked
more
attractive
than
before
but
that
the
decision
had
been
taken
out
of
my
hands
i
could
not
go
about
the
shops
of
verona
buying
prussic
acid
or
revolvers
or
metres
of
stout
rope
and
my
razors
without
stenson
s
care
were
benignantly
blunt
and
i
would
not
condescend
to
braces
i
groaned
and
pished
and
pshawed
but
as
it
was
written
that
i
was
to
live
i
resigned
myself
to
a
barren
and
theoryless
existence
after
a
day
or
two
the
vital
instinct
asserted
itself
more
strongly
i
became
inspired
by
an
illuminating
revelation
i
had
a
preliminary
aim
in
life
i
would
go
out
into
the
world
in
search
of
a
theory
when
found
i
would
apply
it
to
the
regulation
of
the
score
and
a
half
years
during
which
i
might
possibly
expect
to
remain
on
this
planet
i
must
take
my
chances
of
it
leading
me
to
the
corpse
of
another
polyphemus
as
it
struck
me
i
should
not
find
my
theory
in
italy
i
packed
up
my
belongings
and
hastened
from
verona
at
naples
i
picked
up
a
messageries
maritimes
steamer
and
began
a
circular
tour
in
the
levant
at
alexandretta
i
went
ashore
and
inquired
my
way
to
the
dwelling
of
the
prefect
of
police
i
did
not
call
on
hamdi
effendi
but
i
wandered
round
the
walls
and
wondered
in
a
moody
way
where
it
was
that
carlotta
sat
when
harry
came
along
and
whistled
her
like
a
tame
falcon
to
his
arm
it
was
a
white
palace
of
a
house
with
a
closed
balcony
supported
on
rude
corbels
and
tightly
shuttered
at
the
back
spread
a
large
garden
surrounded
by
the
famous
wall
there
was
no
doubt
that
hamdi
was
a
wealthy
personage
and
that
carlotta
s
nurture
had
been
as
gentle
as
that
of
any
lady
in
syria
but
the
place
wherein
carlotta
s
childhood
had
been
sheltered
had
an
air
of
impenetrable
mystery
i
stood
baffled
before
it
as
i
had
stood
so
often
before
carlotta
s
soul
the
result
of
this
portion
of
my
search
was
the
discovery
not
of
a
new
theory
but
of
an
old
pain
i
went
back
to
the
ship
in
a
despondent
mood
and
caused
deep
distress
to
one
of
the
gentlest
creatures
i
have
ever
met
he
was
a
lean
elderly
german
who
no
matter
what
the
occasion
or
what
the
temperature
wore
a
long
a
narrow
black
tie
and
a
little
felt
hat
adorned
with
a
partridge
s
feather
which
gave
him
an
air
of
forlorn
rakishness
his
name
was
doctor
anastasius
dose
and
he
spent
a
blameless
life
in
travelling
up
and
down
the
world
on
behalf
of
a
leipsic
firm
of
which
he
was
a
member
in
search
of
rare
and
curious
books
for
there
are
copies
of
books
which
have
a
pedigree
like
famous
jewels
and
whose
acquisition
a
matter
of
infinite
tact
gives
rise
i
was
told
by
herr
dose
to
the
most
exquisite
thrill
known
to
man
he
brought
me
on
that
morose
afternoon
a
copy
of
the
synonima
in
italian
and
french
of
fliscus
printed
by
simon
magniagus
of
milan
in
and
opened
the
vellum
covers
with
careful
fingers
in
all
the
assemblage
of
human
atoms
that
inhabit
this
vessel
said
he
there
is
but
one
who
is
imbued
with
reverence
for
the
past
and
a
sense
of
the
preciousness
of
the
unique
i
need
not
tell
you
herr
baronet
who
are
a
scholar
that
of
this
book
only
two
copies
exist
in
this
universe
one
is
in
the
university
library
of
bologna
the
other
is
before
your
eyes
it
is
also
the
only
book
known
to
have
been
printed
by
magniagus
see
the
beautiful
small
roman
type
a
masterpiece
ach
herr
baronet
to
have
accomplished
one
such
work
in
a
lifetime
and
then
to
sit
among
the
blessed
saints
and
look
down
on
earth
and
know
that
the
two
sole
copies
in
existence
are
cherished
by
the
elect
what
a
reward
what
eternal
happiness
i
turned
over
the
pages
the
faint
perfume
of
mouldy
lore
ascended
and
i
remembered
the
smell
of
the
histoire
des
uscoques
in
the
embankment
gardens
the
di
in
the
nostrils
of
the
scholar
said
i
woman
he
cried
scandalised
yes
my
friend
said
i
all
things
sublunar
can
be
translated
into
terms
of
woman
fliscus
wrote
because
he
hadn
t
a
wife
simon
magniagus
stopped
printing
because
he
got
married
and
devoted
his
existence
to
reproducing
himself
instead
of
ach
that
is
very
interesting
said
he
could
you
tell
me
the
date
of
magniagus
s
marriage
i
never
heard
of
him
till
this
moment
my
dear
herr
doctor
but
depend
upon
it
he
was
either
married
or
was
going
to
be
married
and
she
ran
away
from
him
and
left
him
without
the
heart
to
print
for
posterity
and
when
he
took
his
seat
among
the
saints
she
said
she
was
so
glad
he
was
a
stupid
old
fellow
he
departed
sorrowingly
from
the
deck
clasping
the
precious
volume
to
his
heart
allusive
or
discursive
speech
scared
him
like
indecency
and
i
had
used
his
gem
but
as
a
peg
whereon
flauntingly
to
hang
it
it
took
me
three
days
to
tame
him
and
to
induce
him
to
show
me
another
of
his
treasures
recently
acquired
in
athens
ioannes
georgius
godelmann
s
de
printed
by
nicholas
bassaeus
of
frankfurt
i
read
him
keats
s
poem
about
the
young
lady
of
corinth
of
which
he
had
never
heard
his
mental
attitude
towards
it
was
the
indulgent
one
of
an
old
diplomatist
towards
a
child
s
woolly
lamb
for
him
literature
had
never
existed
and
printing
ended
in
the
year
but
i
was
sorry
when
he
left
me
at
constantinople
where
he
counted
on
striking
the
track
of
a
bohemian
herbal
printed
at
prague
and
never
more
to
be
read
by
any
of
the
sons
of
man
in
the
summer
he
was
going
in
iceland
by
chance
i
have
learned
since
that
he
died
there
peace
to
his
ashes
for
aught
i
could
see
he
dwelt
in
a
mild
stupor
of
happiness
absorbed
in
the
intoxication
of
a
tremulous
pursuit
i
wondered
whether
his
soul
contained
that
antidote
the
di
perhaps
he
met
it
at
reykjavic
and
he
died
of
dismay
i
thought
that
my
landing
at
alexandretta
was
alone
responsible
for
the
continuance
of
my
dotage
and
hoped
that
fresh
scenes
would
banish
carlotta
s
distracting
image
but
no
it
was
one
of
the
many
vain
reflections
on
which
i
based
a
false
philosophy
whether
in
beyrout
or
the
land
of
the
sweet
singer
of
persephone
or
alexandria
or
on
the
cannebiere
of
marseilles
or
in
the
queer
of
algiers
whither
a
restless
pursuit
of
the
identical
led
me
or
in
lisbon
or
in
the
mountainous
republic
of
andorre
where
i
hoped
to
find
primitive
wisdom
and
to
shape
a
theory
from
first
principles
and
whence
i
was
ironically
driven
by
fleas
whether
on
land
or
sea
in
cities
or
in
solitudes
the
vanished
hand
harped
on
my
heartstrings
and
the
voice
that
was
still
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
cooed
its
into
my
ears
i
remember
overhearing
myself
described
on
a
steamboat
by
a
pretty
american
girl
of
sixteen
as
a
quaint
gentle
old
guy
who
talks
awful
rot
which
no
one
can
understand
and
is
all
the
time
thinking
about
something
my
sudden
emergence
from
the
where
i
was
lighting
a
cigarette
brought
red
confusion
into
the
young
person
s
cheeks
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
i
asked
oh
about
sixty
quoth
the
damsel
i
m
glad
i
m
quaint
and
gentle
even
though
i
do
talk
rot
said
i
with
the
resourcefulness
of
her
nation
she
linked
her
arm
in
mine
and
started
a
confidential
walk
up
and
down
the
deck
you
are
just
a
dear
she
remarked
she
could
not
have
said
more
to
anastasius
dose
had
he
been
there
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
he
must
just
then
have
been
dying
of
the
inevitable
in
iceland
perhaps
the
few
months
had
brought
me
to
resemble
him
instinctively
i
put
my
hand
to
my
head
to
reassure
myself
that
i
was
not
wearing
a
rakish
little
soft
felt
hat
with
a
and
i
reflected
with
some
complacency
that
my
rimless
did
not
give
me
the
owlish
appearance
produced
by
anastasius
dose
s
great
round
goggles
from
such
crumbs
of
vanity
are
we
sometimes
reduced
to
take
comfort
i
just
want
to
know
what
you
are
said
my
young
american
friend
shall
i
confess
my
attraction
she
brought
a
dim
suggestion
of
carlotta
she
had
carlotta
s
colouring
and
carlotta
s
candour
but
there
the
resemblance
stopped
the
grey
matter
of
her
brain
had
been
distilled
from
the
air
of
wall
street
and
there
were
precious
few
things
between
earth
and
sky
of
which
she
hadn
t
prescience
i
m
a
philosopher
said
i
oh
that
s
nothing
so
is
everybody
as
soon
as
they
get
sense
what
did
you
make
your
money
in
i
ve
not
made
any
money
i
answered
meekly
i
thought
all
people
who
were
knighted
in
your
country
had
made
piles
of
knighted
i
exclaimed
what
on
earth
do
you
think
a
quaint
old
guy
like
myself
could
possibly
have
done
to
get
knighted
then
you
re
a
baronet
she
said
severely
i
assure
you
it
is
not
my
i
thought
all
baronets
were
wicked
they
are
in
the
novels
somehow
you
don
t
look
like
a
baronet
you
ought
to
have
a
black
moustache
and
an
eyeglass
and
smoke
a
cigar
and
sneer
but
say
how
do
you
fill
up
the
time
if
you
do
nothing
to
make
money
i
am
going
through
the
world
said
i
on
an
adventurous
quest
like
a
knight
or
a
baronet
if
you
will
of
the
round
table
i
am
in
quest
of
a
theory
of
i
guess
i
was
born
with
it
cried
young
new
york
i
guess
i
ll
die
without
finding
it
said
london
again
my
quiet
house
antoinette
and
stenson
the
routine
of
comfort
my
books
the
dog
manuscript
of
the
history
of
renaissance
morals
unpacked
by
stenson
and
hid
in
its
usual
place
on
the
nothing
changed
yet
everything
utterly
different
a
growing
distaste
for
the
forced
acquaintanceships
of
travel
and
a
craving
for
home
brought
me
back
save
perhaps
in
health
i
had
profited
little
by
my
journeyings
my
bodily
shell
formed
part
of
strange
landscapes
and
occurred
in
fortuitous
gatherings
of
men
but
my
heart
was
all
the
time
in
my
mausoleum
by
the
regent
s
park
i
was
drawn
thither
by
a
force
almost
magnetic
irresistible
my
two
domestics
welcomed
me
home
but
no
one
else
only
my
lawyers
knew
of
my
arrival
with
them
alone
had
i
corresponded
during
the
many
months
of
my
absence
stay
i
did
write
one
letter
to
mcmurray
while
i
was
at
verona
in
reply
to
an
enquiry
as
to
what
had
become
of
carlotta
and
myself
i
answered
courteously
but
briefly
that
carlotta
had
run
away
with
pasquale
and
that
i
should
be
abroad
for
an
indefinite
period
but
not
even
a
letter
from
my
lawyers
awaited
me
i
thought
somewhat
wistfully
that
i
would
willingly
have
paid
six
and
eight
pence
for
it
but
the
feeling
was
momentary
then
began
a
queer
untroubled
life
without
definite
resolve
i
became
a
recluse
living
forlornly
from
day
to
day
like
a
bat
i
avoided
the
outer
sunshine
and
took
my
melancholy
walks
at
night
i
had
a
pride
in
cherishing
the
habit
of
solitude
were
it
not
that
i
entertained
a
real
dislike
of
roots
and
water
and
the
damp
and
manifold
discomforts
of
a
cave
with
which
form
of
habitat
the
ministrations
of
stenson
and
antoinette
would
have
been
inconsistent
i
should
have
gone
forth
into
the
nearest
approach
to
a
thebaid
i
could
discover
i
was
in
fact
touched
by
the
mild
mania
of
the
hermit
my
club
i
never
entered
a
line
drawn
from
east
to
west
a
tangent
at
the
lowest
point
of
the
zoological
gardens
formed
the
southern
boundary
of
my
wanderings
once
i
spied
in
the
distance
that
very
kind
soul
mcmurray
and
rushed
into
a
providential
omnibus
so
as
to
avoid
recognition
my
history
remained
untouched
the
glamour
of
the
renaissance
had
vanished
for
occupation
i
read
the
thaumaturgy
demonology
and
the
like
which
i
had
always
found
a
fascinating
although
futile
study
i
regretted
my
bowing
acquaintance
with
modern
science
which
forbade
my
setting
up
a
laboratory
with
alembics
and
magic
crystals
wherewith
to
conduct
experiments
for
the
finding
of
the
elixir
vitae
and
the
philosopher
s
stone
i
seldom
read
the
newspapers
i
had
an
idea
like
an
eminent
personage
of
the
period
that
a
sort
of
war
was
going
on
but
it
failed
to
interest
me
greatly
i
shrank
from
the
noise
of
it
monsieur
said
antoinette
will
get
ill
if
he
does
not
go
out
into
the
monsieur
said
i
regards
the
sunshine
as
an
impertinent
intrusion
into
a
soul
that
loves
the
if
i
had
made
the
same
remark
to
an
englishwoman
she
would
have
pitied
me
for
a
poor
gentleman
but
antoinette
has
her
nation
s
instinctive
appreciation
of
and
her
sympathy
was
none
the
less
comprehending
when
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
and
said
that
it
was
bad
for
the
stomach
my
good
antoinette
i
remarked
harking
back
in
my
mind
to
a
speculation
of
other
days
if
you
go
on
worrying
me
in
this
manner
about
my
stomach
i
will
build
a
tower
forty
feet
high
in
the
back
garden
and
live
on
top
and
have
my
meals
sent
up
by
a
lift
and
never
come
down
monsieur
might
as
well
be
in
paradise
said
antoinette
ah
said
i
and
i
thought
of
the
bottle
of
prussic
acid
with
mingled
sentiments
all
through
these
many
months
i
had
judith
dwelling
a
pale
ghost
in
the
back
of
my
mind
we
had
parted
so
finally
that
correspondence
between
us
had
seemed
impertinent
but
although
i
had
not
written
to
her
no
small
part
of
the
infinite
sadness
that
had
fallen
upon
my
life
was
the
shadow
of
her
destiny
sweet
judith
how
many
times
did
i
picture
her
sitting
pinched
and
wistful
in
the
little
tin
mission
church
at
hoxton
had
i
marcus
ordeyne
condemned
her
to
that
penitentiary
who
can
hold
the
balance
of
morals
so
truly
as
to
decide
at
last
i
received
a
letter
from
her
on
the
anniversary
of
our
parting
she
had
found
salvation
in
a
strange
thing
which
she
called
duty
i
am
fulfilling
an
appointed
task
she
wrote
and
the
measure
of
my
success
is
the
measure
of
my
happiness
i
am
bringing
consolation
to
a
wayward
and
tormented
spirit
a
year
has
swept
aside
the
petty
feminine
vanities
the
so
to
speak
through
which
a
woman
complacently
views
her
influence
over
a
man
and
it
has
cleared
my
vision
a
year
has
proved
beyond
mortal
question
that
without
me
this
wayward
and
tormented
spirit
would
fail
i
hold
in
my
hands
the
very
soul
of
a
man
what
more
dare
a
woman
ask
of
the
high
gods
you
see
i
use
your
metaphors
still
dearest
of
all
dear
friends
do
not
pity
me
beyond
all
the
fires
of
love
through
which
one
passes
there
is
the
star
of
duty
and
happy
the
individual
who
can
live
in
its
this
was
astonishingly
like
the
theory
of
life
which
i
set
out
from
verona
to
seek
and
which
had
hitherto
eluded
me
it
was
not
very
new
or
subtle
or
inspiring
but
that
is
the
way
of
things
no
matter
through
what
realms
of
the
fantastic
you
may
travel
you
arrive
inevitably
at
the
commonplace
chapter
xxii
i
answered
judith
s
letter
after
the
long
silence
it
seemed
at
first
strange
to
write
to
her
but
soon
i
found
myself
opening
my
heart
as
i
had
never
done
before
to
man
or
woman
the
fact
that
accident
aside
we
were
never
to
meet
again
drew
the
spiritual
elements
in
us
nearer
together
and
the
tone
of
her
letter
loosened
the
bonds
of
my
natural
reserve
i
told
her
of
my
past
year
of
life
of
the
locked
memorial
chamber
upstairs
of
the
madness
through
which
i
had
passed
of
my
weary
pursuit
of
the
theory
and
of
my
attitude
towards
her
solution
of
the
problem
having
written
the
letter
i
felt
comforted
knowing
that
judith
would
understand
i
finished
it
about
six
o
clock
one
afternoon
and
shrinking
from
giving
it
to
stenson
to
post
as
it
was
the
first
private
letter
i
had
written
since
my
arrival
in
london
i
took
it
myself
to
the
the
fresh
air
reproached
me
for
the
unreasonable
indoor
life
i
had
been
leading
and
invited
me
to
remain
outside
it
was
already
dark
an
early
touch
of
frost
in
the
november
air
rendered
it
exhilarating
i
walked
along
the
decorous
residential
roads
of
john
s
wood
feeling
less
remote
from
my
kind
more
in
sympathy
with
the
humdrum
dramas
in
progress
behind
the
rows
of
lighted
windows
now
and
then
a
garden
gate
opened
and
a
man
in
evening
dress
and
a
woman
a
vague
dainty
mass
of
satin
and
frills
and
fur
emerged
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
shaft
of
light
cast
by
the
open
beyond
which
framed
the
and
aproned
and
entering
a
waiting
hansom
drove
off
into
the
darkness
whither
my
speculative
fancy
followed
them
now
and
then
silhouettes
appeared
upon
the
especially
on
the
upper
floors
for
it
was
the
dressing
hour
and
the
cares
of
the
day
were
being
thrown
aside
with
the
workaday
garments
in
one
house
standing
far
back
from
the
road
the
curtains
had
not
been
drawn
as
i
passed
i
saw
a
man
tossing
up
a
delighted
child
in
his
arms
and
the
mother
standing
by
de
mi
a
commonplace
of
ten
thousand
homes
when
the
man
returns
from
his
toil
yet
it
moved
me
to
earn
one
s
bread
to
perpetuate
one
s
species
to
create
duties
and
responsibilities
to
meet
them
like
a
brave
man
to
put
the
new
generation
upon
the
right
path
to
look
back
upon
it
all
and
say
i
have
fulfilled
my
functions
and
pass
forth
quietly
into
the
eternal
laboratory
is
not
that
life
in
its
truth
and
its
essence
and
the
reward
the
commonplace
the
welcome
of
wife
and
children
and
the
tossing
of
a
crowing
babe
in
one
s
arms
and
i
had
missed
it
all
lived
outside
it
all
i
had
spoken
blasphemously
in
my
besotted
ignorance
of
these
sacred
common
things
and
verily
i
had
my
recompense
in
a
desolate
home
and
a
life
of
about
as
much
use
to
humanity
as
that
of
simeon
stylites
on
top
of
his
pillar
so
i
walked
along
the
streets
on
the
track
of
the
wisdom
which
judith
had
revealed
to
me
and
i
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
reaching
it
when
i
arrived
at
my
own
door
but
what
the
deuce
shall
i
do
with
it
when
i
get
it
i
said
as
i
let
myself
in
with
my
i
had
just
put
my
stick
in
the
stand
and
was
taking
off
my
overcoat
when
the
door
of
the
room
next
the
diningroom
opened
and
antoinette
rushed
out
upon
me
oh
monsieur
monsieur
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
oh
monsieur
how
shall
i
tell
you
the
good
soul
broke
into
sobbing
and
weeping
what
is
the
matter
antoinette
z
asked
monsieur
must
not
be
angry
monsieur
is
good
like
the
bon
dieu
but
it
will
give
pain
to
but
what
is
it
i
cried
mystified
have
you
spoiled
the
dinner
i
was
a
million
miles
from
any
anticipation
of
her
answer
has
come
back
i
grew
faint
for
a
moment
as
from
a
blow
over
the
heart
antoinette
raised
her
great
face
monsieur
must
not
drive
her
i
pushed
her
gently
aside
and
entered
the
little
room
which
i
had
furnished
once
as
her
boudoir
on
the
couch
sat
carlotta
white
and
pinched
and
poorly
clad
at
first
i
was
only
conscious
of
her
great
brown
eyes
fixed
upon
me
the
appeal
of
our
first
meeting
intensified
to
piteousness
on
seeing
me
she
did
not
rise
but
cowered
as
if
i
would
strike
her
i
looked
at
her
unable
to
speak
antoinette
stood
sobbing
in
the
doorway
well
said
i
at
last
i
have
come
home
said
carlotta
you
have
been
away
a
long
time
said
i
said
carlotta
why
have
you
come
i
asked
i
had
no
money
said
carlotta
with
her
expressive
gesture
of
upturned
palms
i
had
nothing
but
she
pointed
to
a
tiny
travelling
bag
everything
else
was
at
the
mont
de
piete
the
pawnshop
and
they
would
not
keep
me
any
longer
at
the
pension
i
owed
them
for
three
weeks
and
then
they
lent
me
money
to
buy
my
ticket
to
london
i
said
seer
marcous
would
pay
them
back
so
i
came
but
where
where
is
pasquale
i
asked
he
went
five
six
months
ago
he
gave
me
some
money
and
said
he
would
send
some
more
but
he
did
not
send
any
he
went
to
south
africa
he
said
there
was
a
war
and
he
wanted
to
fight
and
he
said
he
was
sick
of
me
oh
he
was
very
unkind
she
cried
with
the
quiver
of
her
baby
lips
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
are
you
married
no
said
carlotta
damn
him
said
i
between
my
teeth
he
was
going
to
marry
me
but
then
he
said
it
did
not
matter
in
paris
at
first
he
was
so
nice
but
after
a
little
oh
seer
marcous
dear
he
was
so
there
was
a
short
silence
antoinette
wept
by
the
door
uttering
little
exclamations
la
pauvre
petite
le
cher
ange
carlotta
regarded
me
wistfully
i
saw
a
new
look
of
suffering
in
her
eyes
for
myself
i
felt
numb
with
pain
what
kind
of
a
pension
were
you
living
in
i
asked
unutterable
horrors
coming
into
my
head
it
was
a
french
family
an
old
lady
and
two
old
daughters
and
one
fat
german
professor
pasquale
put
me
there
it
was
very
respectable
she
added
with
a
wan
smile
and
so
dull
madame
champet
would
scarcely
let
me
go
into
the
street
by
thank
heaven
you
did
not
fall
into
worse
hands
said
carlotta
unpinned
her
old
straw
hat
quite
a
different
garment
from
the
dainty
she
delighted
in
a
year
before
and
threw
it
on
the
couch
beside
her
a
tress
of
her
glorious
bronze
hair
fell
loose
across
her
forehead
adding
to
the
woebegone
expression
of
her
face
she
rose
and
as
she
did
so
i
seemed
to
notice
a
curious
change
in
her
she
came
to
me
with
extended
hands
seer
marcous
she
whispered
i
took
her
hands
in
mine
oh
my
dear
said
i
why
did
you
leave
me
i
was
wicked
and
i
was
a
little
fool
said
carlotta
i
sighed
released
her
walked
a
bit
apart
there
was
a
blubber
from
the
egregious
old
woman
in
the
threshold
oh
monsieur
is
not
going
to
drive
her
i
turned
upon
her
instead
of
standing
there
weeping
like
a
fountain
and
doing
nothing
why
aren
t
you
getting
mademoiselle
s
room
ready
for
her
because
monsieur
has
the
key
wailed
antoinette
that
s
true
said
i
then
i
reflected
on
the
futility
of
converting
bedchambers
into
mausoleums
for
the
living
the
room
shut
up
for
a
year
would
not
be
habitable
it
would
be
damp
and
in
dust
mademoiselle
shall
sleep
in
my
room
i
said
and
stenson
can
make
me
up
a
bed
and
put
what
i
want
here
go
and
arrange
it
with
antoinette
departed
i
turned
to
carlotta
are
you
very
tired
my
child
oh
yes
so
why
didn
t
you
write
so
that
things
could
have
been
got
ready
for
you
i
don
t
know
i
was
too
unhappy
seer
marcous
she
said
after
a
little
pause
and
then
stopped
yes
i
am
going
to
have
a
she
said
it
in
the
old
childlike
way
oblivious
of
difference
of
sex
with
her
little
foreign
insistence
on
the
final
consonants
i
glanced
hurriedly
at
her
the
fact
was
obvious
she
stood
with
her
hands
helplessly
outspread
the
pathos
of
her
would
have
wrung
the
heart
of
a
devil
thank
god
you
ve
come
home
said
i
huskily
she
began
to
cry
softly
i
put
my
arm
round
her
shoulders
and
comforted
her
she
sobbed
out
incoherent
things
she
wished
she
had
never
seen
pasquale
i
was
good
she
would
stay
with
me
always
she
would
never
run
away
again
i
took
her
upstairs
and
opened
the
door
of
her
room
with
the
key
that
i
had
carried
for
a
year
on
my
bunch
and
turned
on
the
electric
light
see
what
are
still
usable
of
your
old
things
said
i
and
i
will
send
antoinette
up
to
she
looked
around
her
somewhat
puzzled
why
should
i
sleep
in
your
room
when
this
one
is
ready
for
me
my
night
dress
even
the
hot
water
my
dear
said
i
that
hot
water
was
put
for
you
a
year
ago
it
must
be
cold
and
my
red
slippers
and
my
she
cried
quaveringly
then
sinking
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
beside
the
dusty
bed
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
i
stole
away
and
sent
antoinette
to
minister
to
her
a
year
before
i
had
raved
and
ranted
deeming
life
intolerable
and
cursing
the
high
gods
i
suffered
then
it
is
true
but
i
hope
i
may
never
again
go
through
the
suffering
of
that
first
night
of
carlotta
s
return
even
now
i
can
close
my
eyes
and
feel
the
icy
grip
on
my
heart
she
came
down
to
dinner
about
an
hour
later
dressed
in
a
pink
wrapper
one
of
the
last
things
she
had
bought
which
antoinette
as
she
explained
to
excuse
her
delay
had
been
airing
before
the
fire
she
sat
opposite
me
in
her
old
place
penitent
subdued
yet
not
shy
or
ill
at
ease
stenson
waited
on
us
grave
and
imperturbable
as
if
we
had
put
back
the
clock
of
time
a
twelvemonth
the
only
covert
reference
he
made
to
the
event
was
to
murmur
discreetly
in
my
ear
i
have
brought
up
a
bottle
of
the
pommery
sir
marcus
in
the
hope
you
would
drink
i
was
touched
for
the
good
fellow
had
no
other
way
of
showing
his
solicitude
carlotta
allowed
him
to
fill
her
glass
she
sipped
the
wine
and
declared
that
it
did
her
good
she
was
no
longer
a
teetotaller
she
explained
once
she
drank
too
much
and
the
next
day
had
a
headache
why
should
one
have
a
headache
nemesis
said
i
what
is
nemesis
i
found
myself
answering
her
question
in
the
old
way
and
in
her
old
way
she
replied
i
do
not
how
vividly
familiar
it
was
and
yet
how
agonisingly
strange
where
is
polyphemus
she
asked
dead
said
i
how
did
poor
polyphemus
die
he
was
smitten
by
destiny
at
the
end
of
the
last
act
of
a
farcical
the
ghost
of
a
came
from
carlotta
she
composed
herself
immediately
i
often
used
to
think
of
polyphemus
and
seer
marcous
and
antoinette
she
said
musingly
and
then
i
wished
i
was
back
i
have
been
very
she
put
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
framing
her
face
with
her
hands
looked
at
me
and
shook
her
head
oh
you
are
good
oh
you
are
good
go
on
with
your
dinner
my
child
said
i
and
wonder
at
the
genius
of
antoinette
who
has
managed
to
cook
it
and
look
after
you
at
the
same
she
obeyed
meekly
i
watched
her
eat
she
was
famished
i
learned
that
she
had
had
nothing
since
the
early
morning
coffee
and
roll
in
spite
of
pain
i
was
curiously
flattered
by
her
return
i
represented
to
her
after
all
even
though
the
instinct
of
the
prodigal
cat
had
driven
her
hither
i
am
sure
it
had
never
crossed
her
mind
that
my
doors
might
be
shut
against
her
her
first
words
were
i
have
come
the
first
thing
she
did
when
we
went
into
the
after
dinner
was
to
fondle
my
hand
and
lay
it
against
her
cheek
and
say
with
a
deep
sigh
i
am
so
however
shallow
her
butterfly
nature
was
these
things
came
from
its
depths
no
man
can
help
feeling
pleased
at
a
child
s
or
an
animal
s
implicit
trust
in
him
and
the
pleasure
is
of
the
purest
he
feels
that
unreasoning
intuition
has
penetrated
to
some
latent
germ
of
good
in
his
nature
and
for
the
moment
he
is
disarmed
of
evil
carlotta
then
came
blindly
to
what
was
best
in
me
in
her
thoughts
she
sandwiched
me
between
the
cat
and
the
cook
well
in
most
sandwiches
the
is
the
most
essential
she
curled
herself
up
in
the
familiar
and
as
it
was
a
chilly
night
i
sent
for
a
wrap
which
i
threw
over
her
limbs
see
i
have
the
dear
red
slippers
she
remarked
arching
her
instep
and
i
have
my
dear
carlotta
said
i
drew
my
chair
near
her
and
gradually
i
learned
all
the
unhappy
story
pasquale
had
made
love
to
her
from
the
very
first
minute
of
their
acquaintance
even
while
i
was
hunting
for
the
histoire
comique
de
he
had
met
her
many
times
unknown
to
me
they
had
corresponded
her
letters
being
addressed
to
a
little
stationer
s
shop
close
by
she
did
not
love
him
of
that
i
have
an
absolute
conviction
but
he
was
young
he
was
handsome
he
had
the
libertine
s
air
and
manner
she
was
docile
and
she
was
ever
positively
truthful
if
i
had
questioned
her
she
would
have
confessed
frankly
but
i
never
questioned
as
i
never
suspected
i
wondered
sometimes
at
her
readiness
in
quoting
him
i
noticed
odd
coincidences
but
i
was
too
ineffectual
to
draw
inferences
from
phenomena
his
appearance
on
the
paddington
platform
was
prearranged
his
duchessa
at
ealing
a
myth
apparently
he
had
dallied
with
his
fancy
the
fruit
was
his
any
day
for
the
plucking
perhaps
a
rudimentary
sentiment
of
loyalty
towards
me
restrained
him
who
can
tell
the
night
of
our
meeting
with
hamdi
brought
the
crisis
the
turk
s
threats
had
alarmed
both
carlotta
and
myself
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
strike
at
once
he
saw
her
the
next
day
would
to
heaven
i
had
remained
at
home
told
her
i
was
marrying
her
to
save
her
from
hamdi
i
loved
the
other
woman
he
would
save
her
equally
well
from
hamdi
the
other
woman
met
her
soon
after
parting
from
pasquale
and
besought
her
to
give
me
up
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
poor
child
how
should
she
have
known
on
the
previous
evening
i
had
told
her
she
was
to
marry
me
she
was
ready
to
obey
she
went
to
bed
thinking
that
she
was
to
marry
me
in
the
morning
she
went
for
her
music
lesson
pasquale
was
waiting
for
her
they
walked
for
some
distance
down
the
road
he
hailed
a
cab
and
drove
away
with
her
he
said
he
loved
me
said
carlotta
and
he
kissed
me
and
he
told
me
i
must
go
away
with
him
to
paris
and
marry
him
and
i
felt
all
weak
like
that
she
dropped
her
arms
helplessly
in
an
expressive
gesture
and
so
what
could
i
do
didn
t
you
think
carlotta
that
i
might
be
sorry
perhaps
unhappy
i
asked
as
gently
as
i
could
he
said
you
would
be
quite
happy
with
the
other
did
you
believe
him
that
s
why
i
said
i
have
been
very
wicked
carlotta
answered
simply
she
went
on
with
her
story
an
old
miserable
detestable
execrable
story
at
first
all
went
merrily
then
she
fell
ill
in
paris
it
was
her
first
acquaintance
with
the
northern
winter
her
throat
proved
to
be
delicate
and
she
was
laid
up
with
bronchitis
to
men
of
pasquale
s
type
a
woman
ill
is
of
no
more
use
than
a
spavined
horse
or
a
more
than
that
she
becomes
an
infernal
nuisance
it
was
in
his
temperament
to
perform
sporadic
acts
of
fantastic
chivalry
it
appealed
to
something
romantic
theatrical
in
his
facile
nature
but
to
devote
himself
to
a
woman
in
sickness
that
was
different
the
fifteenth
century
italian
hated
like
the
devil
continued
association
with
pain
he
would
have
thrown
his
boots
to
a
beggar
but
he
would
have
danced
in
his
palace
over
the
dungeons
where
his
brother
rotted
in
obscurity
so
poor
carlotta
was
neglected
and
began
to
eat
the
bread
of
disillusion
when
she
got
well
there
was
a
faint
recrudescence
of
affection
has
not
this
story
been
written
a
million
miserable
times
why
should
i
rend
my
heart
again
by
retelling
it
wild
rages
jealousies
quarrels
tears
and
then
one
day
he
said
you
damned
little
fool
i
am
sick
to
death
of
you
and
he
went
away
and
i
never
saw
him
again
he
wrote
and
he
sent
his
valet
to
put
me
in
the
and
yet
carlotta
said
i
bitterly
you
would
go
back
to
him
if
he
sent
for
you
she
sprang
forward
and
gripped
me
by
the
arm
i
was
sitting
quite
close
to
her
and
her
face
wore
the
expression
of
a
child
frightened
with
bogies
go
back
after
what
he
has
done
to
me
you
would
not
send
me
back
seer
marcous
darling
you
will
keep
me
with
you
i
will
be
good
good
good
but
go
back
to
pasquale
oh
she
fell
back
in
her
and
fixed
her
great
deep
imploring
eyes
on
me
my
dear
said
i
you
know
this
is
your
home
as
long
as
ever
you
choose
to
stay
in
it
but
and
i
stroked
her
hair
gently
if
he
comes
back
when
your
child
is
born
his
child
she
drew
herself
up
superbly
it
is
my
child
my
very
very
own
cried
carlotta
it
is
mine
mine
and
i
shall
not
allow
any
one
to
touch
it
and
then
her
face
softened
except
seer
chapter
xxiii
behold
carlotta
again
installed
in
my
house
which
she
regarded
as
her
home
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
sow
any
doubt
thereof
in
her
mind
i
had
learned
perhaps
one
lesson
the
meaning
of
love
the
love
that
is
desire
alone
though
sung
in
all
romance
of
all
the
ages
is
of
the
brute
nature
and
is
doomed
to
perish
the
love
that
pardons
endures
through
wrong
contents
itself
in
abnegation
is
of
the
imperishable
things
that
draw
weak
man
a
little
nearer
to
the
angels
when
carlotta
wept
upon
my
shoulder
during
those
few
first
moments
of
her
return
i
knew
that
all
resentment
was
gone
from
my
heart
that
it
would
have
been
a
poor
ignoble
thing
had
she
come
back
to
me
leprous
of
body
and
abominable
of
spirit
it
would
not
have
mattered
i
would
have
forgiven
her
loved
her
cherished
her
just
the
same
it
was
a
question
not
of
reason
not
of
human
pity
not
of
quixotism
not
of
any
argument
or
sentiment
for
which
i
could
be
responsible
i
was
helpless
obeying
a
reflex
action
of
the
soul
the
days
passed
tranquilly
in
spite
of
pain
i
felt
an
odd
happiness
i
had
nothing
selfishly
to
hope
for
perhaps
i
had
aged
five
years
in
one
and
i
viewed
life
differently
it
was
enough
for
me
that
she
had
come
home
to
the
haven
where
no
harm
could
befall
her
she
was
my
appointed
task
even
as
her
husband
was
judith
s
i
recognised
in
myself
the
man
with
the
one
talent
the
deep
wisdom
of
the
parable
can
be
taken
to
inmost
heart
for
comfort
only
by
men
of
little
destinies
with
infinite
love
and
patience
to
mould
carlotta
into
a
sweet
good
woman
a
wise
mother
of
the
child
that
was
to
be
that
was
the
inglorious
task
which
providence
had
set
me
to
accomplish
in
its
proportion
to
the
aggregate
of
human
effort
it
was
infinitesimal
but
who
shall
say
that
it
was
not
worth
the
doing
save
writing
a
useless
book
in
what
other
sphere
of
sublunar
energy
could
i
have
been
effectual
i
did
not
thus
analyse
my
attitude
at
the
time
the
man
who
does
so
is
a
poser
a
mime
to
his
own
audience
but
looking
back
i
think
i
was
guided
by
some
such
unformulated
considerations
although
my
hermit
mania
was
in
itself
radically
cured
yet
i
altered
nothing
in
my
relations
with
the
outside
world
i
wrote
to
judith
a
brief
account
of
what
had
occurred
and
received
from
her
a
sympathetic
answer
my
reading
among
the
mystics
and
thaumaturgists
put
me
on
the
track
of
arabic
i
found
that
carlotta
knew
enough
of
the
language
to
give
me
elementary
instruction
and
thus
the
whirligig
of
time
brought
in
its
revenge
by
constituting
me
her
pupil
to
our
joint
edification
after
a
while
the
unhappiness
of
the
past
seemed
to
have
faded
from
her
mind
she
spoke
little
of
paris
less
of
the
dull
pension
and
never
of
pasquale
she
bore
towards
him
an
animal
s
silent
animosity
against
a
human
being
who
has
done
it
an
unforgettable
injury
on
the
other
hand
as
i
have
since
discovered
she
was
slowly
developing
and
had
begun
to
realise
that
in
giving
herself
to
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
she
had
committed
a
crime
against
her
sex
for
which
she
had
paid
a
heavy
penalty
a
sentiment
however
which
did
not
mitigate
her
resentment
against
him
often
i
saw
her
sitting
with
knitted
brows
her
needlework
idle
on
her
lap
evidently
unravelling
some
complicated
problem
presently
she
would
either
shake
her
head
sadly
as
if
the
intellectual
process
were
too
hard
for
her
and
resume
her
needle
or
if
she
happened
to
catch
my
glance
she
would
start
smile
reassuringly
at
me
and
apply
herself
with
exaggerated
zeal
to
her
work
these
fits
of
abstraction
were
not
those
of
a
woman
speculating
on
mysteries
of
the
near
future
such
carlotta
also
indulged
in
and
they
were
easy
to
recognise
by
the
dreaminess
of
her
eyes
and
the
faint
smile
flickering
about
her
lips
the
moods
of
knitted
brows
were
periods
of
and
i
wondered
what
they
would
bring
forth
one
afternoon
i
came
home
and
found
her
weeping
over
a
book
when
i
bent
down
to
see
what
she
was
reading
she
had
acquired
a
taste
for
novels
during
the
dull
pension
time
in
paris
she
caught
my
head
with
both
hands
oh
seer
marcous
do
you
think
they
ought
to
make
me
wear
a
great
a
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
like
hester
prynne
she
showed
me
nathaniel
hawthorne
s
scarlet
what
made
you
take
this
out
of
the
shelves
the
title
she
replied
simply
i
am
so
fond
of
red
things
but
i
should
not
like
that
great
red
a
those
were
days
said
i
when
people
thought
they
could
only
be
good
by
being
very
they
would
have
been
more
cruel
if
hester
had
not
loved
the
minister
said
carlotta
looking
at
me
wistfully
my
dear
little
girl
said
i
seeing
whither
her
thoughts
were
tending
do
not
bother
your
brain
with
psychological
what
are
began
carlotta
i
pinched
the
question
as
it
were
out
of
her
cheek
and
smiled
and
took
away
the
book
they
are
a
dreadful
disease
my
little
girl
has
been
afflicted
with
for
some
time
when
you
sit
and
wrinkle
your
forehead
like
this
and
i
scowled
forbiddingly
whereat
carlotta
laughed
you
are
suffering
from
acute
psychological
then
i
am
thinking
said
carlotta
reflectively
don
t
think
too
much
dear
just
now
said
i
it
is
best
for
you
to
be
happy
and
calm
and
contented
otherwise
i
ll
have
to
tell
the
doctor
and
he
ll
give
you
the
blackest
and
nastiest
physic
you
have
ever
to
cure
me
of
a
problem
yes
said
i
emphatically
laughed
carlotta
in
a
superior
way
physic
can
t
cure
you
are
relying
on
an
exploded
fallacy
immortalised
in
a
hackneyed
shakespearian
quotation
i
remarked
go
on
said
carlotta
encouragingly
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
taken
aback
oh
you
darling
seer
marcous
cried
carlotta
it
is
so
lovely
to
hear
you
talk
so
i
went
on
talking
and
the
distress
occasioned
by
the
scarlet
letter
was
forgotten
i
have
mentioned
carlotta
s
needlework
this
was
undertaken
at
the
sapient
instigation
of
antoinette
who
in
her
turn
i
am
sure
neglected
the
ladle
for
the
scissors
and
cast
many
of
her
duties
upon
the
silent
but
sympathetic
stenson
carlotta
herself
delighted
in
these
preparations
she
was
never
happier
than
when
curled
up
on
the
sofa
a
box
of
chocolates
by
her
side
her
frothing
over
like
a
great
dish
of
a
la
with
lawn
or
mull
or
and
i
verily
believe
to
complete
her
content
my
ungainly
figure
and
within
her
purview
she
would
eat
and
sew
industriously
sometimes
she
would
press
too
hard
on
a
sweetmeat
and
with
a
little
cry
would
hold
up
a
sticky
finger
and
thumb
look
she
would
say
puckering
up
her
face
and
to
save
from
soilure
the
dainty
fabric
she
was
working
at
i
would
rise
and
wipe
her
fingers
with
my
handkerchief
whereupon
she
would
coo
out
the
sweetest
thank
you
in
the
world
and
perhaps
hold
up
a
diminutive
garment
isn
t
it
pretty
yes
my
dear
i
would
say
and
i
would
turn
aside
wondering
at
the
exquisite
refinements
of
pain
that
men
were
sometimes
called
upon
to
bear
at
last
the
time
came
i
sat
up
all
night
in
a
torture
of
suspense
having
got
it
into
my
foolish
head
that
carlotta
might
die
the
doctor
came
upon
me
at
six
in
the
morning
sitting
half
frozen
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
he
gave
me
his
cheery
news
he
seemed
to
develop
from
a
commonplace
man
into
a
radiant
archangel
i
met
antoinette
soon
afterwards
busy
important
exultant
she
nevertheless
graciously
accorded
me
a
brief
interview
and
to
think
monsieur
she
exclaimed
as
if
the
crowning
triumph
of
a
million
ions
of
evolution
had
at
last
been
attained
to
think
that
it
is
a
boy
you
would
have
been
just
as
pleased
if
it
had
been
a
girl
said
i
she
shook
her
wise
fat
head
women
ne
vaut
pas
grand
let
it
be
remembered
that
women
are
of
no
great
account
is
a
sentiment
expressed
not
by
me
but
by
antoinette
but
all
the
same
i
soon
found
myself
a
cipher
in
the
house
where
the
triumvirate
of
the
negligible
sex
antoinette
the
nurse
and
carlotta
reigned
despotically
to
write
much
of
carlotta
s
happiness
would
be
to
treat
of
sacred
things
at
which
i
can
only
guess
she
dwelt
in
rapture
the
joy
and
meaning
of
the
universe
were
concentrated
in
the
tiny
bundle
of
pink
flesh
that
lay
on
her
bosom
i
used
to
sit
by
her
side
while
she
talked
unwearyingly
of
him
he
was
a
thing
of
infinite
perfections
he
had
such
a
lot
of
hair
she
won
t
believe
sir
said
the
nurse
that
it
will
all
drop
off
and
a
new
crop
said
carlotta
it
can
t
be
so
cruel
for
it
is
my
hair
see
seer
marcous
darling
isn
t
it
just
my
hair
it
was
her
great
solicitude
that
the
boy
should
resemble
her
i
don
t
know
about
his
nose
she
remarked
critically
there
is
so
little
of
it
yet
and
it
is
so
soft
feel
how
soft
it
is
but
his
eyes
are
brown
like
mine
and
his
mouth
now
look
aren
t
they
just
the
same
she
put
her
cheek
next
to
the
child
s
and
invited
me
to
compare
the
two
adjacent
baby
mouths
they
were
of
a
truth
very
much
alike
she
was
jealous
of
the
baby
desirous
of
having
it
always
with
her
to
tend
and
fondle
impatient
of
the
nurse
and
antoinette
it
was
a
thing
so
intensely
hers
that
she
resented
other
hands
touching
it
oddly
enough
of
me
she
made
an
exception
nothing
delighted
her
more
than
to
put
the
little
creature
into
my
awkward
and
nervous
arms
and
watch
me
carry
it
about
the
room
i
think
she
wanted
to
give
me
something
and
this
share
in
the
babe
was
the
most
precious
gift
she
could
devise
of
pasquale
she
continued
to
say
nothing
in
her
intense
joy
of
motherhood
he
seemed
to
have
become
the
dim
creature
of
a
dream
i
had
registered
the
birth
without
consulting
her
in
the
legal
names
of
the
parents
what
are
you
going
to
call
him
carlotta
i
asked
one
day
petit
that
s
what
antoinette
says
it
s
a
beautiful
there
are
many
points
in
calling
an
infant
one
s
little
cabbage
i
admitted
but
soon
he
ll
grow
up
to
be
as
old
as
i
am
and
i
sighed
who
would
call
me
their
carlotta
laughed
that
is
true
we
shall
have
to
find
a
she
reflected
for
a
few
moments
then
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
continued
her
reflections
he
shall
be
marcus
another
marcus
ordeyne
then
perhaps
some
day
he
will
be
seer
marcous
like
do
you
mean
when
i
die
i
asked
oh
not
for
years
and
years
and
years
she
cried
tightening
her
clasp
in
alarm
but
the
child
lives
longer
than
the
father
it
is
fate
he
will
live
longer
than
let
us
hope
so
dear
i
answered
but
it
is
just
because
i
am
not
his
father
that
he
can
t
be
sir
marcus
when
i
die
he
can
have
my
name
but
my
title
who
will
have
it
no
it
will
die
too
it
will
be
quite
you
are
his
father
you
know
she
whispered
the
law
of
england
takes
no
count
unfortunately
of
things
of
the
spirit
said
i
what
are
things
of
the
spirit
the
things
my
dear
said
i
that
you
are
beginning
to
i
bent
down
and
kissed
the
child
as
it
lay
on
her
lap
poor
little
marcus
ordeyne
i
said
my
poor
quaintly
fathered
little
son
i
m
afraid
there
is
much
trouble
ahead
of
you
but
i
ll
do
my
best
to
help
you
through
bless
you
dear
said
carlotta
softly
i
looked
at
her
in
wonder
she
had
spoken
for
the
first
time
like
a
grown
woman
like
a
woman
with
a
soul
a
few
weeks
later
we
were
sitting
at
breakfast
the
morning
newspaper
contained
the
account
of
a
battle
and
the
lists
of
british
officers
killed
i
scanned
as
usual
the
melancholy
columns
when
a
name
among
the
dead
caught
my
eye
and
i
stared
at
it
stupidly
pasquale
was
dead
killed
outright
by
a
boer
bullet
the
wild
bright
life
was
ended
it
seemed
a
horrible
thing
and
much
as
he
had
wronged
me
my
first
sentiment
was
one
of
dismay
he
was
too
gallant
and
beautiful
a
creature
for
death
carlotta
poured
out
my
tea
and
came
round
with
the
cup
which
she
deposited
by
my
side
to
prevent
her
peeping
over
my
shoulder
at
the
paper
as
she
usually
did
i
laid
it
on
the
table
but
her
quick
eye
had
already
read
the
great
headlines
great
battle
british
officers
killed
oh
let
me
see
seer
no
dear
said
i
go
and
eat
your
she
looked
at
me
strangely
i
tried
to
smile
but
as
i
am
an
incompetent
actor
my
grimace
was
a
proclamation
of
disingenuousness
why
shouldn
t
i
read
it
she
asked
quickly
because
i
say
you
mustn
t
she
continued
to
look
at
me
she
had
suddenly
grown
pale
i
stirred
my
tea
and
made
a
pretence
of
sipping
it
go
on
with
your
breakfast
my
child
i
repeated
there
is
something
something
about
him
in
the
paper
said
carlotta
he
is
a
british
in
the
face
of
her
intuition
further
concealment
appeared
useless
besides
sooner
or
later
she
would
have
to
know
he
is
a
british
officer
no
longer
dear
said
i
is
he
dead
my
mind
flew
back
to
an
evening
long
ago
long
long
ago
it
seemed
when
another
newspaper
had
told
of
another
death
and
my
ears
caught
the
echo
of
the
identical
question
that
had
then
fallen
from
her
lips
i
dreaded
lest
she
should
say
again
i
am
so
i
beckoned
her
to
my
side
and
pointing
with
my
finger
to
the
name
watched
her
face
anxiously
she
read
stared
for
a
bit
in
front
of
her
and
turned
to
me
with
a
piteous
look
i
drew
her
to
me
and
she
laid
her
face
against
my
shoulder
i
don
t
know
why
i
m
crying
seer
marcous
dear
she
said
after
a
while
i
made
her
drink
some
of
my
tea
but
she
would
eat
nothing
and
presently
she
went
upstairs
she
had
not
said
that
she
was
glad
she
had
wept
and
not
known
the
reason
for
her
tears
i
railed
at
myself
for
my
doubts
of
her
she
was
subdued
and
thoughtful
all
the
day
in
the
evening
instead
of
curling
herself
up
in
the
among
the
cushions
she
sat
on
a
stool
by
my
feet
as
i
read
one
hand
supporting
her
chin
the
other
resting
on
my
knee
i
am
glad
he
was
a
brave
man
she
said
at
last
alluding
to
pasquale
for
the
first
time
since
the
morning
i
like
brave
et
decorum
he
died
for
his
country
said
i
it
does
not
hurt
me
now
so
much
to
think
of
him
said
carlotta
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
miserable
pang
of
jealousy
at
pasquale
s
posthumous
rehabilitation
as
a
hero
in
carlotta
s
heart
yet
was
it
not
natural
was
it
not
the
way
of
women
i
saw
myself
far
remote
from
her
and
though
she
never
spoke
of
him
again
i
divined
that
her
thoughts
dwelt
not
untenderly
on
his
memory
i
was
absurd
i
know
but
i
had
begun
almost
to
believe
in
my
paternity
and
i
was
jealous
of
the
rightful
claims
of
the
dead
man
and
yet
had
he
lived
he
might
have
come
back
one
day
with
his
conquering
air
and
his
irresistible
laugh
and
carried
them
both
away
from
me
in
sparing
me
this
crowning
humiliation
i
thanked
the
high
gods
but
never
to
this
day
has
she
mentioned
his
name
again
chapter
xxiv
how
shall
i
set
down
that
which
happened
not
long
afterwards
the
death
of
a
baby
is
so
commonplace
so
unimportant
few
reasoning
people
viewing
the
matter
in
the
abstract
can
do
otherwise
than
rejoice
that
a
human
being
is
saved
from
the
weariness
of
the
tired
years
that
make
up
life
for
who
shall
disprove
the
pessimist
s
assertion
that
it
is
better
not
to
have
been
born
than
to
come
into
the
world
and
that
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
live
but
those
from
whom
the
single
hope
of
their
existence
is
ravished
find
little
consolation
in
reason
grief
is
the
most
intensely
egotistical
of
emotions
i
have
lost
all
that
makes
life
beautiful
to
me
is
not
that
enough
for
the
stricken
soul
to
carlotta
it
meant
a
passage
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
to
me
at
first
it
meant
the
life
of
carlotta
and
then
a
blank
in
my
newly
ordered
scheme
of
things
the
curse
of
ineffectuality
still
pursued
me
i
had
allotted
to
myself
my
humble
task
the
development
of
the
new
generation
in
the
form
of
carlotta
s
boy
and
even
that
small
usefulness
was
i
denied
by
fate
a
chill
a
touch
of
croup
an
agonised
watching
and
the
tiny
thing
lay
dead
antoinette
and
i
had
to
drag
it
stone
cold
from
carlotta
s
bosom
i
alone
carried
it
to
burial
the
little
white
coffin
rested
on
the
opposite
seat
of
the
hired
brougham
and
on
it
was
a
bunch
of
white
flowers
given
by
antoinette
in
the
cemetery
chapel
another
fragment
of
humanity
awaited
sepulture
and
the
funeral
service
was
read
over
both
bodies
i
stood
alone
by
the
little
white
coffin
a
crowd
of
mourners
were
grouped
beside
the
black
one
i
glanced
at
the
inscription
as
i
passed
jane
elliot
in
the
year
of
her
the
officiant
referred
in
the
service
to
our
dear
brother
and
sister
here
it
was
either
an
awful
jest
or
an
awful
verity
my
quaintly
fathered
little
son
had
small
need
of
my
help
through
the
troubles
of
his
life
his
mother
needed
all
that
i
could
give
without
me
she
would
have
died
that
i
verily
believe
i
was
her
solitary
plank
in
the
welter
wherein
she
would
have
been
submerged
she
clung
to
me
literally
clung
to
me
i
sat
for
hours
with
her
grasp
upon
me
to
feel
assured
of
my
physical
presence
alone
seemed
to
bring
her
calm
recent
as
are
those
sleepless
days
and
nights
their
memory
is
all
confused
the
light
burning
dimly
in
the
familiar
chamber
which
i
had
once
sealed
up
as
a
tomb
the
shadows
on
the
wall
the
fevered
face
and
great
hollow
eyes
of
carlotta
against
the
pillows
her
little
hand
clutching
mine
in
desperation
the
soft
tread
of
the
nurse
that
is
all
i
remember
and
when
she
recovered
her
wits
and
grew
sane
although
for
a
long
time
she
spoke
little
and
scarcely
noticed
me
otherwise
she
claimed
me
by
her
side
she
was
still
dazed
by
the
misery
of
her
darkness
it
was
only
then
that
i
realised
the
part
the
child
had
played
in
her
development
her
nature
had
been
stirred
to
the
quick
the
capacity
for
emotion
had
been
awakened
she
had
left
me
without
a
qualm
she
had
given
herself
to
pasquale
without
a
glimmer
of
passion
she
had
returned
to
me
like
a
wounded
animal
seeking
its
home
for
the
child
alone
the
passionate
human
love
had
sprung
flaming
from
the
seed
hidden
in
her
soul
and
now
the
child
was
dead
and
the
sun
had
gone
from
her
sky
and
she
was
benumbed
with
the
icy
blackness
of
the
world
then
came
a
time
when
her
speech
was
loosened
and
she
talked
to
me
incessantly
of
the
child
until
one
day
she
spoke
of
it
as
living
and
clamoured
for
it
and
relapsed
into
her
fever
at
last
one
morning
she
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
and
found
me
watching
for
i
had
relieved
the
nurse
at
six
o
clock
she
smiled
at
me
for
the
first
time
since
the
child
fell
sick
and
took
my
hand
and
kissed
it
it
is
like
waking
into
heaven
to
see
your
face
seer
marcous
darling
she
whispered
i
hope
heaven
is
peopled
by
a
set
of
fellows
i
said
laughed
carlotta
don
t
you
know
you
are
beautiful
you
mustn
t
throw
an
old
jest
in
my
teeth
carlotta
said
i
and
i
reminded
her
how
she
had
once
screamed
with
laughter
when
i
had
told
her
i
was
very
beautiful
carlotta
listened
patiently
until
i
had
ended
and
then
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
you
can
not
understand
seer
marcous
darling
i
have
been
thinking
of
my
little
baby
and
the
angels
and
all
the
angels
are
like
to
cover
the
embarrassment
my
modesty
underwent
i
laughed
and
drew
the
picture
of
myself
with
long
flaxen
hair
and
white
wings
my
angels
hadn
t
got
wings
said
carlotta
seriously
they
all
wore
they
were
real
angels
and
the
one
that
was
most
like
you
brought
my
baby
in
his
arms
for
me
to
kiss
and
when
he
put
it
on
a
white
cloud
to
sleep
and
took
me
up
in
his
arms
instead
and
carried
me
away
away
away
through
the
air
i
didn
t
cry
at
leaving
baby
wasn
t
that
funny
i
snuggled
up
close
to
him
like
that
she
illustrated
the
action
of
snuggling
beneath
the
and
it
was
so
the
pale
sunshine
of
a
fine
february
morning
filtered
into
the
room
from
behind
the
curtains
i
turned
off
the
dimmed
electric
lamp
and
let
full
daylight
into
the
room
oh
cried
carlotta
turning
to
the
window
how
lovely
the
good
sun
is
it
is
more
like
heaven
than
ever
do
you
know
she
added
mysteriously
just
before
i
woke
it
was
all
dark
and
i
had
lost
my
angels
and
i
was
looking
for
i
counselled
her
sagely
to
look
for
no
more
members
of
the
hierarchy
but
to
content
herself
with
the
humbler
denizens
of
this
planet
she
pressed
my
hand
i
ll
try
to
be
contented
seer
marcous
she
did
her
best
poor
child
when
i
was
by
but
i
heard
that
often
she
would
sit
by
a
little
pile
of
garments
and
take
them
up
one
by
one
and
cry
her
heart
out
so
that
though
she
quickly
recovered
her
cheeks
remained
wan
and
drawn
and
pain
lingered
in
her
eyes
the
weather
changed
to
fog
and
damp
and
she
spent
the
days
crouching
by
the
fire
sometimes
not
stirring
a
muscle
for
an
hour
together
her
favourite
seat
was
the
in
the
her
own
boudoir
downstairs
where
she
used
to
receive
instruction
from
the
excellent
miss
griggs
she
scarcely
entered
she
broke
one
of
these
fits
suddenly
and
called
me
by
her
own
pet
version
of
my
name
i
looked
up
from
the
where
i
was
studying
the
arabic
grammar
yes
i
have
been
thinking
oh
thinking
thinking
so
long
i
ve
been
thinking
that
you
must
love
me
very
yes
carlotta
said
i
with
a
half
smile
i
suppose
i
as
much
as
i
loved
my
baby
she
said
seriously
i
used
to
love
you
in
a
different
way
and
now
perhaps
in
the
same
sort
of
way
i
loved
my
baby
because
it
was
mine
she
remarked
looking
at
the
flames
through
one
hand
s
delicate
fingers
i
wanted
to
do
everything
for
him
and
didn
t
want
him
to
do
anything
for
me
i
would
have
died
for
him
it
is
so
strange
yes
i
think
you
must
love
me
like
that
seer
marcous
why
because
when
i
found
you
in
the
embankment
gardens
nearly
two
years
ago
you
were
about
as
helpless
as
your
little
baby
i
replied
somewhat
disingenuously
carlotta
gave
me
a
quick
glance
you
thought
me
then
what
you
call
an
infernal
nuisance
oh
i
know
now
i
have
grown
wise
but
you
were
always
good
you
looked
good
when
you
sat
on
the
seat
you
were
reading
a
dirty
little
histoire
des
uscoques
i
murmured
how
far
away
it
seemed
there
was
a
pause
i
regarded
her
for
a
moment
or
two
she
was
sunk
again
in
serious
reflection
i
sighed
at
the
general
dismalness
of
life
i
suppose
and
resumed
my
arabic
seer
yes
why
didn
t
you
drive
me
away
when
i
came
back
i
shut
up
the
arabic
grammar
and
went
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
fenderstool
my
dear
little
girl
what
a
question
how
could
i
drive
you
away
from
your
own
home
she
flashed
a
queer
scared
look
at
me
then
at
the
fire
then
at
me
again
and
then
burst
out
crying
her
head
and
arms
on
her
knees
i
muttered
a
man
s
words
of
awkward
comfort
saying
something
about
the
baby
it
isn
t
baby
i
m
crying
about
sobbed
carlotta
it
s
me
and
it
s
you
and
it
s
all
the
things
i
m
beginning
to
i
patted
her
head
and
lit
a
cigarette
and
wandered
about
the
room
rather
puzzled
by
carlotta
s
psychological
development
and
yet
stirred
by
a
faint
thrill
at
her
recognition
of
my
affection
at
the
same
time
the
sad
too
late
too
late
was
knelled
in
my
ears
and
i
thought
of
the
and
rode
the
of
regret
s
banalities
i
had
grown
old
passion
had
died
hope
the
hope
of
hearing
the
patter
of
a
child
s
feet
about
my
house
the
hope
of
pride
in
a
of
handing
on
vicariously
though
it
were
the
torch
of
life
hope
was
dead
and
it
was
buried
in
a
little
white
coffin
only
a
great
quiet
love
remained
i
was
a
tired
old
man
and
carlotta
was
to
me
an
infinitely
loved
sister
or
daughter
or
granddaughter
even
so
old
did
i
feel
and
when
i
raised
her
from
the
and
kissed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
it
was
as
grandfatherly
a
kiss
as
had
ever
been
given
in
this
world
the
same
old
problem
again
what
the
deuce
to
do
with
carlotta
yet
not
quite
the
same
rather
what
the
deuce
to
do
with
carlotta
and
myself
in
our
strange
relationship
we
were
inextricably
bound
together
first
she
needed
sunshine
instead
of
the
forlorn
bleakness
of
an
english
spring
and
a
change
from
this
house
of
pain
and
death
and
then
i
too
felt
the
need
of
wider
horizons
london
had
grown
to
be
a
nightmare
city
which
i
never
entered
its
restless
ambitions
were
not
mine
its
pleasures
pleased
me
not
with
not
five
of
its
five
million
inhabitants
dared
i
speak
heart
to
heart
judith
had
gone
out
of
my
life
my
aunts
and
cousins
regarded
me
as
beyond
the
moral
pale
mcmurray
was
still
unaware
of
my
return
to
england
i
confess
to
shabby
treatment
of
my
kind
friend
i
know
she
would
have
flown
to
aid
carlotta
in
her
troubles
but
would
she
have
understood
carlotta
reasoning
now
i
am
convinced
that
she
would
in
those
days
i
did
not
reason
i
shrank
like
a
snail
into
its
shell
the
simile
is
commonplace
but
so
was
i
the
most
commonplace
human
snail
that
ever
occupied
a
commonplace
shell
and
now
the
house
and
its
useless
books
and
its
more
useless
manuscript
history
of
renaissance
morals
all
its
sombre
memories
and
its
haunting
ghosts
of
ineffectualities
became
an
unwholesome
prison
in
which
i
was
wasting
away
a
feeble
existence
i
resolved
to
quit
it
to
leave
my
books
to
abjure
renaissance
morals
and
to
go
forth
with
carlotta
into
the
wilderness
and
the
sunshine
there
to
fulfil
whatever
destiny
the
high
gods
should
decree
chapter
xxv
again
i
sit
on
the
housetop
in
mogador
on
the
morocco
coast
where
a
month
ago
i
began
to
write
these
latter
pages
time
has
passed
quickly
since
that
day
i
said
then
that
on
the
previous
afternoon
something
had
happened
it
was
something
which
i
might
have
foreseen
which
in
fact
with
my
habit
of
putting
the
telescope
to
my
blind
eye
i
obstinately
had
refused
to
foresee
during
our
wanderings
i
had
watched
the
flowering
of
her
splendid
beauty
as
she
drank
in
health
from
the
glow
of
her
own
orient
i
had
noted
the
widening
of
her
intellect
the
quickening
of
her
sympathies
i
had
been
conscious
of
the
expansion
of
her
soul
in
the
great
silences
when
the
stars
flamed
over
the
infinite
sea
of
sand
but
a
growing
wistfulness
that
was
no
longer
the
old
doglike
pleading
of
her
glorious
eyes
a
gathering
sadness
that
was
not
an
aftermath
of
grief
for
the
child
that
had
gone
into
this
if
i
did
remark
it
i
did
not
choose
to
inquire
instead
i
continued
my
study
of
arabic
and
cultivated
the
acquaintance
of
a
learned
moor
whose
conversation
afforded
and
still
affords
me
peculiar
pleasure
one
of
these
days
i
shall
make
a
book
of
his
but
now
i
have
to
tell
of
carlotta
she
accepted
with
alacrity
my
proposal
that
morning
to
ride
over
to
the
palm
tree
house
for
luncheon
as
we
had
done
several
times
before
to
please
me
i
think
she
had
resolutely
overcome
her
natural
indolence
so
much
so
that
she
had
come
to
love
the
nomad
life
of
steamers
and
caravans
and
had
grown
restless
eager
for
fresh
scenes
craving
new
impressions
it
was
i
who
had
cried
a
halt
at
mogador
where
this
furnished
house
to
let
belonging
to
a
german
merchant
absent
in
europe
tempted
me
to
rest
awhile
i
am
not
so
young
as
carlotta
and
i
awakened
to
the
fact
of
a
circumambient
universe
so
many
years
ago
that
i
have
grown
slumberous
carlotta
if
left
to
herself
would
have
gone
on
riding
camels
through
africa
to
the
end
of
time
she
had
changed
in
many
essentials
instead
of
regarding
me
as
an
amiable
purveyor
of
sweetmeats
and
other
necessaries
of
life
to
which
by
the
grace
of
her
being
carlotta
she
was
entitled
she
treated
me
with
human
affection
and
sympathy
keeping
her
own
wants
in
the
background
anxious
only
to
anticipate
mine
but
she
still
loved
sweetmeats
and
would
eat
horrible
moorish
messes
with
an
avidity
only
equalled
by
my
repugnance
she
was
still
the
same
carlotta
on
the
other
hand
again
she
had
of
late
abandoned
her
caressing
habits
if
she
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
she
did
it
timorously
whereat
i
would
laugh
and
she
would
grow
confused
once
she
had
driven
me
to
frenzy
with
her
fondling
those
days
had
passed
i
told
myself
that
i
was
as
old
as
the
sphinx
we
had
moralised
over
in
egypt
we
lunched
then
at
the
palm
tree
house
and
rode
back
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
to
mogador
we
were
alone
as
we
knew
the
path
across
the
tongue
of
desert
and
had
no
need
of
a
guide
and
the
rabble
of
urchins
who
like
their
attendant
flies
infest
the
tourist
on
his
journeyings
on
our
right
the
desert
rose
to
meet
a
near
horizon
on
our
left
sandhills
and
boulders
cut
off
the
view
ahead
the
shimmering
line
beyond
which
the
sea
and
city
lay
we
were
enveloped
by
solitude
and
stillness
in
the
clear
african
air
objects
detached
themselves
against
the
sky
with
startling
definition
i
had
unconsciously
ridden
a
bit
ahead
of
carlotta
thinking
my
own
thoughts
and
sighing
as
a
man
often
does
sigh
for
the
vague
unattainable
which
is
happiness
suddenly
i
missed
her
by
my
side
and
turning
round
saw
a
sight
that
made
my
heart
beat
with
its
sheer
beauty
it
was
only
carlotta
on
her
barbarically
betrapped
and
besaddled
mule
but
it
was
carlotta
glorified
in
colour
she
held
above
her
head
a
cotton
parasol
which
she
had
bought
to
her
delight
and
my
disgust
in
mogador
an
impossible
thing
all
deep
cherry
reds
and
yellows
a
hateful
thing
made
for
a
pantomime
or
for
this
african
afternoon
outspread
and
luminous
in
the
white
sunlight
its
cherry
reds
and
yellows
floated
like
translucences
of
wine
above
carlotta
s
bronze
hair
crowned
by
a
white
sun
hat
her
warm
and
the
dazzling
white
of
her
surah
silk
blouse
the
whole
picture
cut
out
vivid
against
the
indigo
of
the
sky
it
was
a
radiant
vision
i
stared
openmouthed
smitten
with
the
pang
that
sudden
and
transient
loveliness
can
sometimes
deal
as
carlotta
approached
her
figure
swaying
with
the
jog
of
her
barbaric
beast
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
mine
she
halted
and
for
a
moment
we
looked
at
one
another
and
in
those
wonderful
eyes
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
beautiful
sadness
a
spiritual
appeal
the
moment
passed
we
started
again
side
by
side
neither
speaking
i
did
not
look
at
her
conscious
of
a
vague
trouble
things
that
i
had
thought
dead
stirred
in
my
heart
presently
like
a
dawn
of
infinite
delicacy
rose
the
city
before
us
its
fairy
minarets
and
towers
gleamed
first
white
in
an
atmosphere
of
pale
amethyst
toning
through
shades
of
green
to
the
blue
of
the
zenith
and
the
lazy
sea
lay
at
the
city
s
foot
a
pavement
of
lapis
lazuli
but
all
was
faint
unreal
far
far
away
a
group
of
palms
caught
opalescent
reflections
a
slight
breeze
had
sprung
up
raising
minute
particles
of
sand
which
caused
the
elfland
on
the
horizon
to
quiver
like
a
mirage
it
is
a
said
i
in
admiration
carlotta
did
not
reply
i
thought
she
had
not
heard
we
jogged
on
a
little
in
silence
at
last
she
drew
very
close
to
me
shall
we
ever
get
there
she
asked
pointing
ahead
with
the
hand
that
held
the
reins
to
mogador
yes
i
hope
so
i
answered
with
a
laugh
i
thought
she
was
tired
no
not
mogador
the
where
every
one
wants
to
you
have
travelled
far
my
dear
said
i
to
hanker
now
after
and
the
unattainable
i
knew
a
little
girl
once
who
would
have
asked
what
is
a
she
doesn
t
ask
now
because
she
knows
replied
carlotta
no
we
shall
never
get
there
it
looks
as
if
we
were
riding
straight
into
it
but
when
we
get
close
it
will
just
be
aren
t
you
happy
carlotta
i
asked
are
you
seer
marcous
i
i
am
a
philosopher
my
child
and
a
happy
philosopher
would
be
a
a
freak
a
subject
for
a
barnum
bailey
show
if
they
caught
him
they
would
put
him
between
the
hairy
man
and
the
living
i
suppose
i
m
getting
to
be
a
philosopher
too
said
carlotta
and
i
hate
it
sometimes
i
think
i
hate
everything
and
everybody
save
you
seer
marcous
darling
it
s
wicked
of
me
i
must
have
been
born
wicked
but
i
used
to
be
happy
i
never
wanted
to
go
to
i
was
just
like
a
cat
like
polyphemus
do
you
remember
polyphemus
yes
said
i
and
then
set
off
my
balance
by
this
strange
conversation
with
carlotta
i
added
i
killed
she
turned
a
startled
face
to
me
you
killed
him
why
he
laughed
at
me
because
i
was
unhappy
said
i
through
me
yes
through
you
but
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
we
were
not
discussing
the
death
of
polyphemus
we
were
talking
about
being
philosophers
and
you
said
that
as
a
philosopher
you
hated
everything
and
everybody
except
me
why
do
you
exclude
me
carlotta
we
were
riding
so
near
together
that
my
leg
rubbed
her
i
looked
hard
at
her
she
turned
away
her
head
and
put
the
pantomime
parasol
between
us
i
heard
a
little
choking
sob
let
us
get
off
and
sit
down
a
little
i
want
to
cry
the
end
of
all
feminine
philosophy
i
said
somewhat
brutally
no
it
s
getting
late
that
s
only
mogador
in
front
of
us
let
us
go
to
carlotta
shifted
her
parasol
quickly
what
has
happened
to
you
seer
marcous
you
have
never
spoken
to
me
like
that
the
very
deuce
seems
to
have
happened
said
i
angrily
though
why
i
should
have
felt
angry
heaven
only
knows
first
you
turn
yourself
into
a
royal
academy
picture
with
that
unspeakable
umbrella
of
yours
and
the
trumpery
blue
sky
and
sunshine
and
make
my
sentimental
soul
ache
and
then
you
it
s
a
very
pretty
umbrella
said
carlotta
looking
upwards
at
it
demurely
give
it
to
me
i
said
she
yielded
it
with
her
usual
docility
i
cast
it
upon
the
desert
being
open
it
gave
one
or
two
silly
rebounds
then
lay
still
carlotta
reined
up
her
mule
she
said
in
her
old
way
i
dismounted
hurriedly
and
helped
her
down
and
passed
my
arm
through
the
two
bridles
my
dear
child
said
i
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
here
we
have
been
living
for
months
the
most
tranquil
and
unruffled
existence
and
now
suddenly
you
begin
to
talk
about
and
the
impossibility
of
getting
there
and
i
turn
angry
and
heave
parasols
about
africa
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
it
was
that
i
should
be
treating
carlotta
as
a
woman
after
the
fashion
of
the
hero
of
a
modern
french
novel
perhaps
i
was
younger
than
i
thought
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
downward
why
are
you
angry
with
me
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
i
haven
t
the
remotest
idea
said
i
she
lifted
her
eyelids
slowly
oh
very
very
slowly
glanced
quiveringly
at
me
while
the
shadow
of
a
smile
fluttered
round
her
lips
i
verily
believe
the
baggage
exulted
in
her
feminine
heart
i
turned
away
leading
the
two
animals
and
picked
up
the
parasol
which
i
closed
and
restored
to
her
i
thought
you
wanted
to
cry
i
remarked
i
can
t
said
carlotta
plaintively
and
you
won
t
tell
me
why
you
exclude
me
from
your
universal
hatred
carlotta
dug
up
the
sand
with
the
point
of
her
foot
the
sight
of
it
recalled
the
row
of
pink
toes
thrust
unashamedly
before
my
eyes
on
the
second
day
of
her
arrival
in
london
an
old
hope
an
old
fear
an
old
struggle
renewed
themselves
she
was
more
adorably
beautiful
even
than
the
carlotta
of
the
pink
tus
and
spiritually
she
was
reborn
i
heard
her
whisper
i
can
now
i
had
sworn
to
myself
all
the
oaths
that
a
man
can
swear
that
i
should
be
carlotta
s
grandfather
to
the
end
of
time
hitherto
i
had
felt
the
part
now
suddenly
grey
beard
and
slippered
pantaloons
are
cast
aside
and
i
am
young
again
with
a
glow
in
my
heart
which
beats
fast
at
her
beauty
i
shut
my
teeth
no
said
i
to
myself
the
curtain
shall
not
rise
on
that
farcical
tragedy
i
threw
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
carlotta
s
mule
which
with
its
companion
had
been
regarding
us
with
bland
stupidity
i
think
we
had
better
ride
on
carlotta
i
said
she
meekly
gave
me
her
little
foot
and
i
hoisted
her
into
the
saddle
we
did
not
exchange
a
word
till
we
reached
mogador
but
each
of
us
felt
that
something
had
happened
at
dinner
we
met
as
usual
carlotta
spoke
somewhat
feverishly
of
our
travels
and
asked
me
numberless
questions
betraying
an
unprecedented
thirst
for
information
i
never
gave
her
historical
instruction
with
less
zest
after
the
meal
we
went
onto
the
flat
roof
carlotta
poured
out
my
coffee
at
the
small
table
beside
the
long
madeira
cane
chair
which
was
my
accustomed
seat
the
starlit
night
was
blue
and
languorous
from
some
cafe
came
the
monotonous
strains
of
moorish
music
the
harsh
strings
and
harsh
men
s
voices
softened
by
the
distance
carlotta
took
my
when
i
had
finished
and
set
it
down
in
her
granddaughterly
way
then
she
stood
in
front
of
me
won
t
you
make
a
little
room
for
me
on
your
chair
seer
marcous
darling
i
shifted
my
feet
from
the
and
she
sat
down
i
may
observe
that
i
was
not
in
oriental
bashawdom
occupying
the
one
and
only
chair
on
the
housetop
tell
me
about
the
stars
she
said
i
knew
what
she
meant
she
loved
the
old
greek
myths
their
poetry
obscured
though
it
was
through
my
prose
appealed
to
her
young
imagination
she
was
passing
through
an
exquisite
phase
of
development
i
scanned
the
heavens
for
a
text
and
found
one
in
the
pleiades
and
i
told
her
how
these
were
seven
daughters
of
atlas
and
pleione
who
herself
was
the
daughter
of
the
sea
and
how
they
were
all
pure
maidens
save
one
and
were
the
companions
of
artemis
how
orion
the
hunter
who
was
afterwards
slain
by
artemis
and
whose
girdle
gleamed
up
there
in
the
sky
pursued
them
with
evil
intent
and
how
they
prayed
the
gods
for
deliverance
and
were
changed
into
the
everlasting
stars
and
lastly
how
the
one
who
was
not
a
maiden
for
she
loved
a
mortal
shrank
away
from
her
sisters
through
shame
and
was
invisible
to
the
eye
of
man
she
was
ashamed
said
carlotta
in
a
low
voice
because
she
loved
some
one
afterwards
one
of
the
gods
who
would
not
look
at
her
because
she
had
given
herself
to
a
mortal
a
woman
then
has
a
fire
here
she
clasped
her
hands
to
her
bosom
and
wishes
she
could
burn
away
to
nothing
nothing
just
to
air
and
become
she
was
rising
hurriedly
on
the
last
word
but
i
brought
my
hands
down
on
her
shoulders
carlotta
my
child
said
i
what
do
you
mean
she
seized
my
wrists
and
struggling
to
rise
panted
out
in
desperation
you
are
one
of
the
gods
and
i
wish
i
were
changed
into
an
invisible
i
don
t
said
i
huskily
by
main
force
i
drew
her
to
me
and
our
lips
met
she
yielded
and
this
time
the
whole
soul
of
carlotta
came
to
me
in
the
kiss
it
s
beautiful
to
snuggle
up
against
you
again
said
my
ever
direct
carlotta
after
a
while
i
haven
t
done
it
oh
for
such
a
long
she
sighed
contentedly
seer
marcous
you
must
call
me
marcus
now
said
i
somewhat
fatuously
she
shook
her
head
as
it
lay
on
my
shoulder
no
you
are
marcus
or
sir
marcus
to
everybody
to
me
you
are
always
seer
marcous
seer
marcous
darling
she
half
whispered
after
a
pause
once
i
did
not
know
the
difference
between
a
god
and
a
mortal
it
was
only
that
morning
when
i
woke
up
you
took
me
for
a
saint
in
a
said
i
it
s
the
same
thing
she
retorted
and
then
taking
up
her
parable
she
told
me
in
her
artless
way
the
inner
history
of
her
heart
since
that
morning
but
what
she
said
is
sacred
also
a
man
feels
himself
to
be
a
pitiful
dog
of
a
god
when
a
woman
relates
how
she
came
to
establish
him
on
her
high
altar
later
we
struck
a
lighter
vein
and
spoke
of
the
present
the
enchantment
of
the
hour
the
scented
air
the
african
stars
it
seems
my
dear
said
i
that
we
have
got
to
nephelococcygia
after
what
is
nephelococcygia
asked
carlotta
i
relented
it
s
a
base
aristophanic
libel
on
our
said
i
thus
out
of
evil
has
come
good
out
of
pain
has
grown
happiness
out
of
horror
has
sprung
an
everlasting
love
many
a
man
will
say
that
in
all
my
relations
with
carlotta
i
have
comported
myself
as
a
fool
and
that
my
marriage
is
the
crowning
folly
well
i
pretend
not
unto
wisdom
wisdom
would
have
married
me
to
five
thousand
a
year
a
position
in
fashionable
society
my
cousin
dora
and
premature
old
age
antecedent
to
eternal
destruction
i
hold
that
my
salvation
has
lain
the
way
of
folly
again
it
may
be
urged
against
me
that
i
have
squandered
my
life
that
with
all
my
learning
such
as
it
is
i
have
achieved
nothing
i
once
thought
so
i
boasted
of
it
in
my
diary
when
i
complacently
styled
myself
a
waster
in
earth
s
factory
oh
that
diary
let
me
here
solemnly
retract
and
abjure
every
crude
and
idiot
opinion
and
reflection
of
life
set
forth
in
that
frenetic
record
i
regard
myself
not
as
a
waster
i
remember
a
passage
in
epictetus
treating
of
the
ways
of
providence
for
what
else
can
i
do
a
lame
old
man
than
sing
hymns
to
god
if
then
i
were
a
nightingale
i
would
do
the
part
of
a
nightingale
if
i
were
a
swan
i
would
do
like
a
swan
but
now
i
am
a
rational
creature
and
i
ought
to
praise
god
this
is
my
work
i
do
it
nor
will
i
desert
this
post
so
long
as
i
am
allowed
to
keep
it
and
i
exhort
you
to
join
in
this
same
no
i
am
neither
nightingale
nor
swan
and
can
not
add
as
they
do
to
the
beauty
of
the
earth
the
lame
old
man
has
his
limitations
but
within
them
he
can
by
cleaving
to
his
post
and
praising
god
fulfil
his
destiny
carlotta
coming
onto
the
housetop
to
summon
me
to
lunch
looks
over
my
shoulder
as
i
write
these
words
but
you
are
not
a
lame
old
man
she
cries
in
indignation
you
are
the
youngest
and
strongest
and
cleverest
man
in
the
world
what
am
i
to
do
with
these
miraculous
gifts
i
ask
laughing
you
are
to
become
famous
she
says
with
conviction
very
well
my
dear
we
will
have
to
go
to
some
new
land
where
attaining
fame
is
easier
for
a
beginner
than
in
london
and
we
ll
send
for
antoinette
and
stenson
to
help
that
will
be
very
nice
she
observes
so
i
am
to
become
famous
que
femme
veut
dieu
le
and
carlotta
has
got
a
soul
of
her
own
now
and
means
to
make
the
most
of
it
it
will
lead
me
upward
somewhere
but
whether
i
am
to
be
king
of
new
babylon
or
prime
minister
of
new
zealand
or
lawgiver
to
a
polynesian
tribe
is
a
secret
as
yet
hidden
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
whence
carlotta
doubtless
will
snatch
it
in
her
own
good
time
you
are
writing
a
lot
of
rubbish
says
carlotta
and
a
little
truth
the
mixture
is
life
i
answer
