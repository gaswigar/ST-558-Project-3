is
illustration
all
the
way
there
david
had
saved
this
moment
for
himself
struggling
not
to
peek
until
the
proper
time
came
when
the
car
finally
stopped
the
rest
of
them
got
out
stiffly
and
went
into
the
new
house
but
david
walked
slowly
into
the
back
yard
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
for
a
whole
minute
he
stood
there
not
daring
to
look
up
then
he
took
a
deep
breath
clenched
his
hands
tightly
and
lifted
his
head
there
it
was
as
dad
had
described
it
but
infinitely
more
grand
it
swept
upward
from
the
valley
floor
beautifully
shaped
and
soaring
so
tall
that
its
misty
blue
peak
could
surely
talk
face
to
face
with
the
stars
to
david
who
had
never
seen
a
mountain
before
the
sight
was
almost
too
much
to
bear
he
felt
so
tight
and
shivery
inside
that
he
did
know
whether
he
wanted
to
laugh
or
cry
or
both
and
the
really
wonderful
thing
about
the
mountain
was
the
way
it
at
him
he
was
certain
that
it
was
smiling
at
him
like
an
old
friend
who
had
been
waiting
for
years
to
see
him
again
and
when
he
closed
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
which
whispered
come
along
then
and
climb
it
would
be
so
easy
to
go
the
back
yard
was
hedged
in
with
part
of
the
hedge
growing
right
across
the
toes
of
the
mountain
but
there
was
a
hole
in
the
privet
large
enough
to
crawl
through
and
just
beyond
the
hedge
the
mountainside
awaited
him
going
up
and
up
in
one
smooth
sweep
until
the
green
and
tawny
faded
into
hazy
heights
of
rock
it
was
waiting
for
him
come
and
climb
it
whispered
come
and
climb
but
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
first
they
were
going
to
move
into
the
new
house
the
moving
van
was
standing
out
in
front
the
car
must
be
unloaded
david
would
be
needed
to
carry
things
regretfully
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
peak
and
whispered
it
should
take
long
i
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
then
he
went
around
to
the
front
door
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
speeding
things
up
illustration
inside
everything
was
in
confusion
dad
was
pushing
chairs
and
tables
around
in
an
aimless
way
mother
was
saying
they
all
have
to
go
out
again
we
forgot
to
put
down
the
rug
first
aunt
amy
was
making
short
dashes
between
the
kitchen
and
the
dining
room
muttering
to
herself
and
beckie
was
roaring
in
her
crib
because
it
was
time
for
her
bottle
david
asked
can
i
do
anything
hoping
that
the
answer
would
be
no
aunt
amy
said
grabbing
him
by
the
arm
help
me
look
for
that
ironing
board
when
the
ironing
board
was
finally
located
mother
had
something
for
him
to
do
and
when
he
was
finished
with
that
dad
called
for
his
help
so
the
afternoon
wore
on
without
letup
and
also
without
any
signs
of
progress
in
their
moving
when
david
finally
got
a
chance
to
sneak
out
for
a
breathing
spell
he
felt
his
heart
sink
somehow
in
all
the
rush
and
confusion
the
afternoon
had
disappeared
already
the
evening
sun
was
throwing
shadows
across
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
touching
its
peak
with
a
ruddy
blaze
it
was
too
late
now
he
would
have
to
wait
until
morning
before
he
could
climb
as
he
gazed
up
miserably
at
the
glowing
summit
he
thought
he
saw
a
tiny
speck
soar
out
from
it
in
a
brief
circle
was
it
a
bird
of
some
sort
or
just
one
of
those
dots
that
swim
before
your
eyes
when
you
stare
too
long
at
the
sky
it
almost
seemed
like
the
mountain
waving
its
hand
as
if
to
say
that
it
was
quite
all
right
for
him
to
wait
until
morning
he
felt
better
then
and
returned
more
cheerfully
to
the
moving
it
was
long
after
dark
before
the
moving
van
drove
away
beckie
crooned
happily
over
her
bottle
and
the
rest
of
them
gathered
in
the
kitchen
for
a
late
supper
of
sandwiches
and
canned
soup
but
david
could
not
eat
until
he
had
found
the
courage
to
ask
one
question
may
i
climb
the
mountain
tomorrow
aunt
amy
muttered
something
about
landslides
which
were
firmly
fixed
in
her
mind
as
the
fate
of
people
who
climbed
mountains
but
dad
said
i
do
see
why
not
do
you
and
looked
to
mother
for
agreement
mother
said
well
be
very
careful
in
a
doubtful
tone
and
that
was
that
you
never
know
what
you
will
find
when
you
climb
a
mountain
even
if
you
have
climbed
them
before
which
of
course
david
never
had
looking
up
from
the
foot
of
the
mountain
he
had
thought
that
it
was
a
smooth
slope
from
bottom
to
top
but
he
was
discovering
as
he
climbed
that
it
was
not
smooth
at
all
but
very
much
broken
up
there
were
terraces
ledges
knolls
ravines
and
embankments
one
after
another
the
exciting
part
of
it
was
that
each
feature
concealed
the
ones
above
it
at
the
top
of
a
rise
would
be
an
outcropping
of
strangely
colored
rock
invisible
from
below
beyond
the
outcropping
a
small
stand
of
aspens
would
quiver
in
the
breeze
their
quicksilver
leaves
hiding
a
tiny
meadow
on
the
slope
behind
and
when
the
meadow
had
been
discovered
there
would
be
a
something
else
beyond
he
was
a
real
explorer
now
when
he
got
to
the
top
he
thought
he
would
build
a
little
tower
of
stones
the
way
explorers
always
do
but
at
the
end
of
two
hours
steady
climbing
he
was
ready
to
admit
that
he
would
never
reach
the
peak
that
day
it
still
rose
above
his
head
seeming
as
far
distant
as
ever
but
he
did
not
care
now
it
had
been
a
glorious
climb
and
the
distance
he
had
already
covered
was
a
considerable
one
he
looked
back
the
town
looked
like
a
model
of
a
town
with
little
toy
houses
and
roofs
among
the
trees
that
made
a
darker
patch
on
the
pattern
of
the
valley
floor
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
seemed
like
blue
clouds
stretching
out
over
the
edge
of
the
world
even
the
peak
could
not
give
him
a
better
view
than
this
david
gazed
up
the
face
of
a
scarp
which
rose
like
a
cliff
above
him
a
smooth
bare
wall
of
rock
that
had
halted
his
climb
halfway
up
the
scarp
was
a
dark
horizontal
line
of
bushes
something
like
a
hedge
apparently
there
was
a
ledge
or
shelf
there
and
he
decided
to
climb
up
to
it
before
he
returned
home
to
scale
the
rock
face
itself
was
impossible
however
there
were
no
hand
or
foot
holds
so
he
turned
and
made
his
way
through
the
grass
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
bare
stone
then
he
started
upward
again
it
was
hard
work
vines
clutched
at
his
feet
and
the
bushes
seemed
unwilling
to
let
him
pass
he
had
one
nasty
slip
which
might
have
been
his
last
if
he
had
not
grabbed
a
tough
clump
of
weeds
at
the
crucial
instant
but
oh
it
was
worth
it
he
felt
like
shouting
when
at
last
he
reached
the
ledge
truly
it
was
an
enchanted
place
it
was
a
long
level
strip
of
ground
several
yards
wide
carpeted
with
short
grass
and
dandelions
bushes
grew
along
most
of
the
outer
edge
the
inner
edge
was
bounded
by
a
second
scarp
a
wall
of
red
stone
with
sparkling
points
of
light
imbedded
in
its
smooth
surface
david
threw
himself
on
the
grass
and
rolled
in
it
it
was
warm
and
soft
and
it
soothed
away
the
hurt
of
his
aching
muscles
and
the
sting
of
his
scratches
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
cushioned
his
head
in
his
hands
the
sky
seemed
to
be
slipping
along
overhead
like
a
broad
blue
river
the
breeze
ruffled
his
hair
and
whispered
the
bushes
murmured
and
gossiped
to
each
other
even
the
sunlight
seemed
to
hum
to
him
as
it
laid
warm
hands
on
his
face
but
there
was
another
sound
which
now
and
then
rose
above
these
murmurs
then
it
would
fade
and
be
drowned
out
by
the
breeze
hard
to
say
why
but
it
just
did
not
seem
to
fit
there
david
propped
himself
up
on
his
elbows
and
listened
more
intently
the
sound
faded
he
had
been
imagining
it
no
he
had
not
been
imagining
it
there
it
was
again
he
sat
up
now
he
noticed
that
the
ledge
was
divided
by
a
thicket
which
grew
from
the
inner
side
to
the
outer
the
noise
whatever
it
was
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
thicket
david
curiosity
was
aroused
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
wise
to
be
cautious
the
noise
did
not
sound
dangerous
but
well
he
had
never
been
up
a
mountain
before
and
there
was
no
telling
what
he
might
find
he
dropped
into
a
crouch
and
crept
silently
up
to
the
tangle
of
bushes
his
heart
began
to
pound
and
he
swallowed
to
relieve
the
dryness
in
his
throat
the
noise
was
much
more
distinct
now
and
it
sounded
like
like
yes
not
only
sounded
like
but
someone
talking
to
himself
who
could
it
possibly
be
well
there
was
only
one
way
to
find
out
he
dropped
down
on
his
stomach
and
carefully
began
to
worm
his
way
under
the
thicket
the
branches
grew
very
low
and
the
ground
was
full
of
lumps
and
knobs
which
dug
into
him
with
every
movement
there
were
vines
too
and
some
prickly
things
like
thistles
which
had
to
be
pushed
out
of
the
way
without
allowing
their
leaves
to
rustle
he
progressed
by
inches
pushing
with
his
toes
pulling
with
his
finger
tips
wriggling
with
the
rest
of
his
body
at
last
he
could
see
light
breaking
through
the
foliage
in
front
of
him
he
was
nearing
the
other
side
a
bunch
of
leaves
hung
before
his
face
he
hesitated
then
pushed
them
aside
gently
slowly
and
peered
out
he
thought
his
heart
would
stop
illustration
which
david
meets
the
phoenix
and
there
is
a
change
in
illustration
there
stood
an
enormous
bird
david
had
been
to
the
zoo
and
at
home
he
had
a
book
of
birds
with
colored
pictures
he
knew
the
more
common
large
birds
of
the
world
the
ostrich
the
condor
the
albatross
eagles
cranes
storks
but
bird
its
shape
was
like
that
of
an
eagle
but
stouter
its
neck
had
the
length
and
elegant
curve
of
a
swan
neck
its
head
was
again
like
an
eagle
with
a
hooked
beak
but
the
expression
in
its
brown
eyes
was
mild
the
long
wings
were
blunt
at
the
tips
the
tail
was
short
and
broad
the
legs
feathered
halfway
down
ended
in
taloned
feet
an
iridescent
sheen
sparkled
on
its
plumage
reflecting
sunlight
from
the
scarlet
crest
the
golden
neck
and
back
the
breast
of
silver
the
sapphire
wings
and
tail
its
size
alone
would
have
been
enough
to
take
david
breath
away
he
could
have
stood
beneath
the
arch
of
that
neck
with
room
to
spare
but
the
most
astonishing
thing
was
that
the
bird
had
an
open
book
on
the
ground
and
was
apparently
trying
to
learn
part
of
it
by
heart
vives
the
bird
read
very
slowly
and
distinctly
staring
hard
at
the
book
vivís
is
simple
enough
you
blockhead
now
then
without
looking
it
cleared
its
throat
looked
away
from
the
book
and
repeated
in
a
rapid
mutter
vives
vive
ah
oh
dear
what
the
matter
with
me
here
the
temptation
to
peek
overcame
it
for
an
instant
and
its
head
wavered
but
it
said
no
no
in
a
firm
tone
looked
carefully
the
other
way
and
began
once
more
vives
quite
correct
so
far
ah
ah
oh
dear
these
verbs
where
was
i
oh
yes
david
head
reeled
as
he
watched
this
amazing
performance
there
was
no
need
to
pinch
himself
to
see
if
he
were
dreaming
he
was
perfectly
wide
awake
everything
else
around
him
was
behaving
in
a
normal
way
the
mountain
was
solid
beneath
him
the
sunlight
streamed
down
as
before
yet
there
was
the
bird
unmistakably
before
him
undeniably
studying
its
book
and
speaking
to
itself
david
mind
caught
hold
of
a
phrase
and
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
what
on
what
on
but
of
course
there
was
no
answer
to
that
question
and
he
might
have
lain
hidden
there
all
day
staring
out
at
the
bird
and
marveling
had
it
not
been
for
a
bee
which
came
droning
into
the
thicket
straight
for
him
he
had
a
horror
of
bees
ever
since
he
had
once
bumped
into
a
hive
by
mistake
when
he
heard
that
dread
sound
approaching
his
whole
body
broke
into
a
sweat
all
thought
of
the
bird
was
immediately
driven
from
his
head
he
could
tell
from
the
noise
that
it
was
one
of
those
big
fuzzy
bees
the
ones
with
the
nasty
dispositions
perhaps
the
thought
paralyzed
him
perhaps
he
was
lying
on
its
nest
on
it
came
buzzing
and
blundering
through
the
leaves
suddenly
it
was
upon
him
so
close
that
he
could
feel
the
tiny
breeze
stirred
up
by
its
wings
all
vanished
he
beat
at
it
wildly
with
his
hands
burst
out
of
the
thicket
like
an
explosion
and
smashed
full
tilt
into
the
bird
before
he
could
stop
himself
with
a
piercing
squawk
the
bird
shot
into
the
air
flipped
over
and
came
fluttering
down
facing
him
talons
outstretched
hooked
beak
open
eyes
completely
terrified
david
turned
and
bolted
for
the
thicket
he
managed
to
thrash
halfway
through
when
a
vine
trapped
his
feet
he
pitched
forward
shielding
his
face
with
his
arms
and
was
caught
up
short
by
a
dead
branch
snagging
his
shirt
he
was
stuck
this
was
the
end
he
closed
his
eyes
and
waited
too
numb
with
fear
to
think
or
cry
out
nothing
happened
slowly
he
turned
his
head
around
the
bird
although
it
still
glared
menacingly
seemed
undecided
whether
to
attack
or
flee
what
may
i
ask
are
you
doing
here
it
said
at
last
in
a
severe
voice
i
i
i
was
taking
a
walk
david
said
faintly
i
awfully
sorry
if
i
bothered
you
or
anything
you
should
not
have
come
up
here
at
the
bird
snapped
illustration
well
i
really
sorry
but
there
was
a
bee
in
the
bush
here
i
i
did
mean
to
the
fright
had
been
too
much
tears
started
in
david
eyes
and
his
lip
began
to
tremble
the
bird
seemed
reassured
for
its
manner
visibly
softened
it
lowered
and
folded
its
wings
and
the
glare
faded
from
its
eyes
i
go
away
david
mumbled
apologetically
only
i
stuck
he
rubbed
his
eyes
on
his
sleeve
the
bird
looked
at
his
dismal
face
and
began
to
fidget
awkwardly
there
there
it
said
i
had
no
intention
of
i
am
afraid
that
i
stuck
did
you
say
very
easily
mended
my
dear
fellow
merely
a
question
of
here
let
me
look
it
crashed
through
the
thicket
to
where
david
was
caught
and
thrust
its
head
down
through
the
branches
its
muffled
voice
came
floating
up
take
heart
there
seems
to
be
aha
just
so
one
moment
please
bit
of
vine
we
are
there
was
a
snapping
sound
from
below
and
david
foot
was
released
he
unstuck
the
snag
from
his
shirt
pushed
his
way
out
of
the
thicket
and
sat
down
weakly
on
the
grass
whew
at
least
the
bird
was
not
going
to
harm
him
it
seemed
to
be
quite
a
kindly
creature
really
he
had
just
frightened
it
and
made
it
angry
by
bursting
out
of
the
bushes
so
suddenly
he
heard
a
flailing
in
the
thicket
followed
by
the
bird
anxious
voice
hello
are
you
still
there
yes
what
there
were
more
sounds
of
struggle
this
is
rather
awkward
i
the
fact
is
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
stuck
myself
could
you
yes
of
course
said
david
he
smiled
to
himself
a
little
shakily
and
the
thicket
when
he
had
disentangled
the
bird
the
two
of
them
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
each
other
they
hesitated
not
quite
sure
how
to
begin
i
trust
said
the
bird
at
last
that
you
are
not
of
a
scientific
turn
of
mind
i
do
know
said
david
i
interested
in
things
if
that
what
you
mean
no
it
is
not
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
interest
shown
by
normal
people
and
the
obsessive
interest
of
scientists
you
are
not
i
hope
acquainted
with
any
scientists
no
ah
said
the
bird
with
a
relieved
sigh
everything
is
quite
all
right
then
i
do
hope
that
you
will
forgive
my
behavior
i
am
not
usually
so
rude
the
fact
is
that
you
gave
me
quite
a
horrible
start
oh
i
sorry
i
frightened
you
frightened
my
dear
fellow
said
the
bird
testily
i
am
never
frightened
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
what
i
mean
is
david
said
quickly
that
you
frightened
this
seemed
to
pacify
the
bird
and
david
to
heighten
the
good
impression
added
golly
you
looked
fierce
the
bird
smiled
complacently
i
rise
to
a
terrifying
ferocity
when
aroused
a
noble
strain
of
fighting
blood
courses
through
my
veins
not
that
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
quarrels
you
understand
on
the
contrary
could
well
describe
my
general
attitude
meditative
i
am
usually
to
be
found
thinking
i
have
a
powerful
intellect
no
doubt
you
have
noticed
the
stamp
of
genius
on
my
brow
david
supposed
that
the
bird
meant
its
scarlet
crest
and
he
nodded
that
one
of
the
first
things
i
noticed
about
you
indeed
cried
the
bird
delightedly
you
are
certainly
more
alert
than
most
but
as
i
was
saying
i
am
usually
to
be
found
thinking
the
first
condition
of
thinking
is
solitude
and
that
i
fear
is
a
desideratum
most
difficult
of
realization
i
beg
your
pardon
people
explained
the
bird
do
not
leave
you
alone
oh
said
david
he
flushed
thinking
that
the
words
had
been
aimed
at
him
and
began
to
get
up
but
the
bird
signaled
him
to
remain
where
he
was
i
do
not
mean
my
dear
fellow
i
assure
you
that
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
it
is
all
the
others
do
you
know
that
i
have
spent
the
greater
part
of
my
life
being
pursued
i
was
chased
out
of
egypt
like
a
common
game
bird
out
of
the
mountains
of
greece
too
the
hills
of
lebanon
the
desert
of
africa
the
arabian
wilds
no
matter
where
i
fled
people
would
come
prying
and
peering
and
sneaking
after
me
i
have
tried
tibet
china
and
the
steppes
of
siberia
with
the
same
result
at
last
i
heard
of
a
region
where
there
was
peace
where
the
inhabitants
let
each
other
alone
here
i
thought
i
should
pardon
me
for
interrupting
where
why
to
be
brief
said
the
bird
waving
its
wing
toward
the
valley
here
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
breathe
at
age
one
likes
a
little
quiet
would
you
believe
that
i
am
close
to
five
hundred
years
old
golly
said
david
you
do
look
it
the
bird
gave
a
pleased
laugh
my
splendid
physical
condition
conceal
my
years
at
any
rate
i
settled
here
in
the
hope
of
being
left
alone
but
do
you
think
i
was
safe
david
seeing
that
he
was
supposed
to
answer
no
shook
his
head
quite
right
sighed
the
bird
i
was
not
i
had
been
here
no
more
than
three
months
when
a
scientist
was
hot
on
my
trail
a
most
disagreeable
fellow
always
sneaking
about
with
binoculars
a
camera
and
i
fear
a
gun
that
is
why
you
startled
me
for
an
instant
i
thought
you
were
he
oh
david
cried
i
awfully
sorry
i
did
bother
you
on
purpose
it
just
that
i
never
saw
a
mountain
before
so
i
climbed
up
here
to
see
what
one
looked
like
you
climbed
up
here
yes
climbed
said
the
bird
looking
very
thoughtful
climbed
i
might
have
known
it
proves
you
see
that
the
same
thing
could
be
done
again
by
someone
older
and
stronger
a
very
grave
point
oh
i
see
said
david
you
mean
the
precisely
the
scientist
he
is
i
fear
very
persistent
i
first
noticed
him
over
there
the
bird
waved
its
wing
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
so
i
removed
to
this
location
but
he
will
undoubtedly
continue
his
pursuit
the
bad
penny
always
turns
up
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
sharp
scientific
nose
is
again
quivering
in
my
direction
oh
dear
that
terrible
your
sympathy
touches
me
said
the
bird
huskily
it
is
most
unusual
to
find
someone
who
understands
but
have
no
fear
for
me
i
am
taking
steps
i
am
preparing
imagine
his
disappointment
when
he
arrives
here
and
finds
me
flown
from
the
nest
i
am
to
be
brief
leaving
do
you
see
this
book
yes
said
david
i
heard
you
reading
it
but
i
could
understand
it
is
it
magic
no
my
boy
it
is
spanish
i
have
chosen
a
little
spot
chilly
but
isolated
in
the
andes
mountains
south
america
you
know
and
of
course
one
must
be
prepared
i
am
learning
spanish
so
that
i
shall
be
able
to
make
my
way
about
in
south
america
i
must
admit
my
extreme
reluctance
to
depart
i
have
become
very
fond
of
this
ledge
it
is
exactly
suited
to
my
needs
ideal
climate
magnificent
view
they
fell
into
a
lengthy
silence
the
bird
gazed
sadly
out
over
the
valley
and
david
rested
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
thought
the
mystery
was
clearing
up
the
bird
presence
on
the
mountain
and
the
fact
that
it
had
been
reading
a
book
were
explained
and
so
natural
was
its
speech
that
david
found
himself
accepting
it
as
nothing
unusual
the
thing
that
worried
him
now
was
that
the
bird
would
soon
leave
here
they
had
only
just
met
and
already
the
promise
of
a
most
interesting
friendship
was
dissolving
the
bird
had
taken
time
to
talk
to
him
and
explain
things
to
him
as
though
he
were
an
equal
and
although
he
did
not
understand
many
of
the
long
words
it
used
he
felt
pleased
at
being
spoken
to
as
though
he
did
understand
and
the
bird
knew
all
about
faraway
countries
had
visited
them
and
lived
in
them
and
had
adventures
in
them
for
almost
five
hundred
years
oh
there
were
so
many
things
david
wanted
to
know
and
ask
about
but
the
bird
was
leaving
if
only
he
could
persuade
it
to
stay
even
for
a
short
while
he
could
try
anyhow
after
all
the
bird
had
said
itself
that
it
did
not
want
to
go
bird
he
stopped
and
flushed
it
was
hard
to
put
into
words
your
servant
my
boy
well
i
i
do
believe
i
know
your
name
david
stammered
unable
to
get
the
real
question
out
ah
forgive
me
cried
the
bird
jumping
up
permit
me
the
honor
of
presenting
myself
i
daresay
my
name
is
familiar
to
you
celebrated
as
it
is
in
song
and
story
i
am
the
one
and
only
the
unique
phoenix
and
the
phoenix
bowed
deeply
very
glad
to
meet
you
said
david
i
david
delighted
my
dear
fellow
an
honor
and
a
pleasure
they
shook
hand
and
wing
solemnly
now
as
you
were
saying
well
phoenix
i
was
just
thinking
david
stammered
it
too
bad
i
mean
could
you
it
would
be
nice
if
we
well
do
you
really
to
go
to
south
america
it
would
be
nice
if
you
stay
a
while
until
the
scientist
shows
up
anyway
and
i
like
talking
with
you
his
face
burned
it
seemed
like
a
lot
to
ask
the
phoenix
harrumphed
several
times
in
its
throat
and
shuffled
its
feet
really
i
can
not
tell
you
how
how
much
you
well
really
such
a
delightful
request
ah
harrumph
perhaps
it
can
be
arranged
oh
phoenix
david
threw
his
arms
around
the
bird
neck
and
then
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
turned
a
somersault
on
the
grass
but
for
the
present
it
seems
to
be
getting
late
said
the
phoenix
we
shall
talk
it
over
some
other
time
and
decide
golly
it
late
i
had
noticed
well
i
have
to
go
or
they
worry
about
me
at
home
but
i
can
come
up
and
see
you
tomorrow
ca
i
of
course
my
boy
in
the
bustle
of
morning
in
the
hush
of
noon
in
the
ah
to
be
brief
at
any
time
and
i
bring
you
some
cookies
if
you
like
ah
said
the
phoenix
closing
its
eyes
sugar
cookies
by
any
chance
it
asked
faintly
david
noticed
the
feathers
of
its
throat
jumping
up
and
down
with
rapid
swallowing
motions
i
ask
aunt
amy
to
make
some
tonight
ah
splendid
my
boy
splendid
shall
we
say
not
more
than
ah
that
is
not
than
ah
fifteen
all
right
phoenix
my
aunt
amy
keeps
a
big
jar
full
of
cookies
and
i
can
have
as
many
as
i
like
the
phoenix
took
david
arm
and
together
they
strolled
to
the
other
end
of
the
ledge
now
do
mention
this
to
anyone
but
there
is
an
old
goat
trail
down
this
side
it
is
somewhat
grown
over
but
eyes
as
sharp
as
yours
should
have
no
trouble
with
it
it
will
make
your
travels
up
and
down
easier
another
thing
i
trust
you
will
not
make
known
our
rendezvous
our
what
you
will
not
tell
anyone
that
i
am
here
oh
no
i
wo
say
a
word
well
i
see
you
tomorrow
yes
as
the
french
so
cleverly
say
it
ah
well
to
be
brief
my
boy
until
tomorrow
then
david
waved
his
hand
found
the
goat
trail
and
started
down
he
was
too
happy
even
to
whistle
so
he
contented
himself
with
running
whenever
he
found
a
level
place
and
when
he
reached
home
he
stood
on
his
hands
in
the
back
yard
for
two
whole
seconds
illustration
which
it
is
decided
that
david
should
have
an
education
and
an
experiment
is
illustration
next
day
it
took
less
than
an
hour
to
reach
the
ledge
and
david
was
sure
that
he
could
shorten
the
time
even
more
when
he
was
familiar
with
the
goat
trail
the
phoenix
was
not
in
sight
when
he
arrived
and
for
an
instant
david
was
stricken
with
fright
had
the
bird
gone
in
spite
of
its
promise
but
no
he
heard
a
reassuring
noise
it
came
from
the
thicket
and
it
sounded
very
much
like
a
snore
david
smiled
to
himself
and
shouted
hello
phoenix
there
was
a
thrashing
sound
in
the
thicket
and
the
phoenix
appeared
looking
very
rumpled
and
yawning
behind
its
wing
greetings
my
boy
it
cried
a
splendid
morning
then
the
phoenix
caught
sight
of
the
paper
bag
in
david
hand
and
swallowed
in
a
suggestive
way
david
thrust
the
bag
of
cookies
behind
his
back
now
phoenix
he
said
firmly
you
have
to
promise
me
you
wo
go
away
to
south
america
you
said
last
night
that
it
could
be
arranged
so
arrange
it
right
now
until
we
do
not
one
the
phoenix
drew
itself
up
indignantly
my
very
dear
fellow
it
said
you
wound
me
you
cut
me
to
the
quick
i
will
not
be
bribed
i
it
stopped
and
swallowed
again
oh
well
it
continued
more
mildly
one
does
not
fight
fate
does
one
i
suppose
under
these
circumstances
i
must
accept
it
settled
then
david
cried
joyfully
so
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
together
and
for
a
long
time
nothing
was
heard
but
sounds
of
munching
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
at
last
brushing
the
crumbs
from
its
chest
i
take
a
modest
pride
in
my
way
with
words
but
nothing
in
the
language
can
do
these
ah
baked
poems
justice
words
fail
me
i
glad
you
like
them
david
said
politely
and
now
my
boy
continued
the
phoenix
as
it
settled
back
comfortably
i
have
been
thinking
yesterday
you
showed
an
intelligent
interest
in
my
problems
and
asked
intelligent
questions
you
did
not
scoff
as
others
might
have
done
you
have
very
rare
qualities
david
flushed
and
mumbled
denials
do
not
be
so
modest
my
boy
i
speak
the
truth
it
came
to
me
that
such
a
mind
as
yours
having
these
qualities
should
be
further
cultivated
and
refined
and
i
should
be
avoiding
my
duty
if
i
did
not
take
this
task
in
hand
myself
of
course
i
suppose
some
attempt
to
educate
you
has
already
been
made
has
it
not
well
i
go
to
school
if
that
what
you
mean
not
now
though
because
it
summer
vacation
and
what
do
they
teach
you
there
oh
reading
and
writing
and
arithmetic
and
things
like
that
aha
said
the
phoenix
triumphantly
just
as
i
suspected
a
classical
education
understand
me
i
have
nothing
against
a
classical
education
as
such
i
realize
that
mathematics
greek
and
latin
are
excellent
for
the
discipline
of
the
mind
but
in
the
broad
view
a
classical
education
is
not
a
true
education
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
one
must
face
it
with
a
education
the
problems
of
life
my
dear
fellow
classical
education
completely
ignores
them
for
example
how
do
you
tell
a
true
unicorn
from
a
false
one
i
i
do
know
i
thought
not
where
do
you
find
the
philosopher
stone
i
do
know
well
then
i
shall
ask
a
simple
one
what
is
the
first
rule
of
defense
when
attacked
by
a
chimera
david
squirmed
uncomfortably
i
afraid
i
do
know
that
either
he
said
in
a
small
voice
there
you
are
cried
the
phoenix
you
do
not
have
a
true
practical
education
you
are
not
ready
for
life
i
my
boy
am
going
to
take
your
education
in
hand
oh
said
david
do
you
mean
are
you
going
to
give
me
lessons
through
his
mind
flashed
a
picture
of
the
phoenix
with
spectacles
on
its
beak
and
a
ruler
in
its
wing
writing
out
sentences
on
a
blackboard
the
thought
gave
him
a
sinking
feeling
after
all
it
was
summer
and
summer
was
supposed
to
be
vacation
time
and
what
an
education
it
will
be
the
phoenix
went
on
ignoring
his
question
absolutely
without
equal
the
full
benefit
of
my
vast
knowledge
plus
a
number
of
trips
to
oh
said
david
suddenly
feeling
much
better
different
oh
phoenix
that
be
wonderful
where
will
we
go
everywhere
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
with
an
airy
wave
of
its
wing
to
all
corners
of
the
earth
we
shall
visit
my
friends
and
acquaintances
oh
do
you
have
of
course
my
boy
i
am
nothing
if
not
a
good
mixer
my
acquaintances
to
mention
but
a
few
include
fauns
dragons
unicorns
trolls
gryffins
gryffons
gryffens
excuse
me
david
interrupted
what
were
those
last
three
please
gryffins
explained
the
phoenix
are
the
small
reddish
friendly
ones
gryffons
are
the
proud
ones
gryffens
ah
well
the
most
anyone
can
say
for
them
is
that
they
are
harmless
they
are
very
stupid
i
see
said
david
doubtfully
what
do
they
look
like
each
looks
like
the
others
my
boy
except
that
some
are
bigger
and
some
are
smaller
but
to
continue
sea
monsters
leprechauns
rocs
gnomes
elves
basilisks
nymphs
ah
and
many
others
all
are
of
the
better
sort
since
as
i
have
many
times
truly
observed
one
is
known
by
the
company
one
keeps
and
your
education
will
cost
you
nothing
of
course
it
be
agreeable
if
you
could
supply
me
with
cookies
from
time
to
time
as
many
as
you
want
phoenix
will
we
go
to
africa
naturally
my
boy
your
education
will
include
and
egypt
and
china
and
arabia
yes
your
education
will
oh
phoenix
phoenix
david
jumped
up
and
began
to
caper
while
the
phoenix
beamed
but
suddenly
he
stopped
how
are
we
going
to
travel
phoenix
i
have
wings
my
boy
yes
but
i
do
do
not
be
so
dense
my
dear
fellow
i
shall
carry
you
on
my
back
of
course
oh
said
david
weakly
on
your
on
your
back
are
you
sure
that
is
there
some
other
i
mean
can
you
do
it
the
phoenix
drew
itself
up
to
its
full
height
i
am
hurt
yes
deeply
hurt
by
your
lack
of
faith
my
magnificent
build
should
make
it
evident
that
i
am
an
exceedingly
powerful
flyer
in
the
heyday
of
my
youth
i
could
fly
around
the
world
in
five
hours
but
come
along
i
shall
give
you
proof
positive
david
reluctantly
followed
the
phoenix
to
a
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
shelf
where
there
was
a
gap
in
the
bushes
he
glanced
over
the
brink
the
sheer
face
of
the
scarp
fell
away
beneath
them
plunging
down
to
the
tiny
trees
and
rocks
below
he
stepped
back
quickly
with
a
shudder
let
let
do
it
tomorrow
he
quavered
nonsense
said
the
phoenix
firmly
no
time
like
the
present
now
then
up
on
my
back
am
i
going
to
sit
on
my
back
quite
so
now
your
arms
around
my
neck
your
legs
my
wings
please
there
we
are
ready
no
said
david
faintly
splendid
the
proof
is
to
be
demonstrated
the
to
be
brief
we
are
off
the
great
wings
were
outstretched
david
gulped
clutched
the
phoenix
neck
tightly
and
shut
his
eyes
he
felt
a
hopping
sensation
then
a
long
sickening
downward
swoop
that
seemed
to
leave
his
stomach
far
behind
a
tremendous
rush
of
air
snatched
at
his
shirt
he
opened
his
eyes
and
choked
with
fright
the
ground
below
was
rushing
up
to
meet
them
swaying
and
revolving
something
was
terribly
wrong
the
phoenix
was
breathing
in
hoarse
gasps
its
wings
were
pounding
the
air
frantically
now
they
had
turned
back
the
scarp
loomed
before
them
solid
and
blank
above
them
high
above
them
was
the
ledge
it
looked
as
though
they
would
not
get
back
to
it
up
up
up
they
crawled
through
the
air
the
wings
flapped
wildly
faster
and
faster
they
were
gaining
slipping
back
gaining
again
the
phoenix
sobbed
as
it
stretched
its
neck
in
the
last
effort
fifty
feet
twenty
feet
ten
with
a
tremendous
surge
of
its
wings
the
phoenix
managed
to
get
one
claw
over
the
edge
and
to
seize
the
branch
of
a
bush
in
its
beak
david
legs
slipped
from
the
back
he
dangled
over
the
abyss
from
the
outstretched
neck
and
prayed
the
bush
saved
them
they
scrabbled
up
over
the
edge
tottered
there
for
an
instant
and
dropped
on
the
grass
for
a
long
time
they
lay
gasping
and
trembling
at
last
the
phoenix
weakly
raised
its
head
puff
well
my
boy
puff
puff
whew
very
narrow
squeak
i
puff
illustration
david
could
not
answer
the
earth
reeled
under
him
and
would
not
stop
no
matter
how
tightly
he
clutched
the
grass
puff
i
repeat
i
am
puff
an
exceedingly
powerful
flyer
there
are
few
birds
none
i
daresay
who
puff
could
have
done
even
this
much
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
you
are
a
lot
puff
heavier
than
you
look
i
hope
you
are
not
being
overfed
at
home
i
i
do
know
said
david
wondering
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
be
sick
well
my
course
is
clear
said
the
phoenix
firmly
i
must
practice
exercises
roadwork
and
what
not
rigorous
diet
lots
of
sleep
regular
hours
courage
my
dear
fellow
we
shall
do
it
yet
and
so
for
the
following
week
the
phoenix
practiced
every
morning
david
climbed
up
to
the
ledge
bringing
sandwiches
for
himself
cookies
for
the
phoenix
and
a
wet
towel
then
while
he
kept
count
the
phoenix
did
exercises
after
this
the
bird
would
jog
trot
up
and
down
the
ledge
and
practice
jumping
then
there
would
be
a
rest
and
refreshment
period
and
when
that
was
over
the
phoenix
would
launch
itself
into
the
air
this
was
the
part
david
liked
best
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
the
phoenix
dashed
back
and
forth
at
top
speed
wheeled
in
circles
shot
straight
up
like
a
rocket
plunged
hovered
looped
rolled
soared
fluttered
now
and
then
it
would
swoop
back
to
the
ledge
beside
david
and
wipe
the
sweat
from
its
brow
i
trust
you
see
signs
of
progress
my
boy
david
would
wrap
the
wet
towel
around
the
phoenix
neck
doing
better
and
better
phoenix
i
especially
like
that
part
where
you
twist
over
on
your
back
and
loop
and
plunge
all
at
the
same
time
i
do
perform
that
rather
well
do
i
it
is
not
easy
but
just
the
thing
for
acquiring
ouch
muscle
tone
are
there
any
more
cookies
ah
there
are
delicious
as
i
was
saying
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
boy
if
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
try
again
the
phoenix
would
take
wing
again
and
david
would
settle
back
against
a
rock
and
watch
sometimes
he
thought
of
the
education
he
was
to
get
sometimes
he
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
if
could
fly
and
sometimes
he
did
not
think
at
all
but
just
sat
with
his
eyes
half
shut
feeling
the
sunlight
on
his
face
and
listening
to
the
rustle
of
the
wind
in
the
thicket
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
phoenix
after
a
brilliant
display
of
acrobatics
landed
on
the
ledge
clasped
its
wings
behind
its
back
and
looked
solemnly
at
david
well
my
boy
it
said
i
believe
your
education
can
begin
forthwith
are
you
ready
which
david
and
the
phoenix
go
to
visit
the
gryffins
and
a
great
danger
is
narrowly
illustration
a
chill
raced
up
and
down
david
spine
as
he
got
to
his
feet
do
do
you
think
a
week
practice
is
enough
absolutely
my
dear
fellow
i
am
now
in
the
very
pink
of
condition
not
that
i
was
ever
out
of
condition
mind
you
it
was
merely
that
i
ah
well
to
be
brief
my
boy
i
am
now
ready
yes
but
well
you
remember
the
last
time
yes
look
here
if
it
will
make
you
feel
better
suppose
we
have
a
trial
flight
along
the
ledge
well
all
right
david
got
up
as
before
on
the
phoenix
back
the
phoenix
spread
its
wings
and
hopped
into
the
air
they
glided
easily
down
the
length
of
the
ledge
clearing
the
thicket
in
the
middle
by
a
good
two
feet
there
you
are
my
boy
said
the
bird
proudly
as
they
landed
at
the
other
end
shall
we
go
let
go
said
david
as
bravely
as
he
could
they
were
in
the
air
again
once
more
he
felt
that
rush
of
wind
against
his
face
and
heard
the
pounding
of
wings
but
this
time
there
was
no
giddy
downward
swoop
he
breathed
again
and
opened
his
eyes
the
world
was
falling
away
and
everything
on
it
was
growing
smaller
by
the
second
the
valley
could
be
cradled
in
two
hands
the
mountains
on
either
side
looked
like
wrinkles
in
gray
cloth
now
he
could
see
plains
in
the
distance
and
little
silver
threads
of
rivers
as
he
looked
the
whole
world
began
to
revolve
slowly
the
phoenix
was
soaring
in
a
wide
circle
well
my
boy
it
called
over
its
shoulder
whom
shall
we
visit
first
it
really
up
to
you
phoenix
david
shouted
back
but
how
about
the
the
biffens
or
whiffens
or
whatever
you
called
them
you
mean
the
gryffins
gryffons
and
gryffens
my
boy
very
well
we
shall
visit
the
gryffins
only
however
it
is
best
to
leave
the
others
alone
the
phoenix
swung
around
and
began
to
fly
toward
the
morning
sun
with
such
tremendous
speed
that
david
had
to
crouch
down
to
avoid
being
blown
off
the
wind
screamed
past
his
ears
tore
at
his
shirt
and
hair
and
made
his
eyes
brim
over
with
tears
it
was
cold
but
he
was
too
excited
to
care
below
them
plains
rivers
forests
and
cities
rushed
across
the
face
of
the
earth
this
is
wonderful
phoenix
david
shouted
the
phoenix
reply
was
not
clear
normal
speed
air
stream
prime
days
of
my
youth
were
the
only
words
david
caught
but
he
could
tell
from
the
tone
that
the
phoenix
was
pleased
the
view
below
was
not
to
last
long
within
half
an
hour
they
had
run
into
a
heavy
overcast
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
like
flying
through
very
wet
cold
cotton
david
glanced
down
hoping
to
see
the
fog
thin
out
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
a
black
object
rocketing
up
toward
them
before
he
could
call
out
a
warning
the
thing
hurtled
by
so
close
that
its
backwash
very
nearly
knocked
him
from
the
bird
back
the
phoenix
reduced
speed
and
the
black
object
after
banking
in
a
wide
curve
came
cruising
up
alongside
david
was
amazed
to
see
that
it
was
a
pale
but
beautiful
lady
dressed
all
in
black
sitting
on
a
broom
hello
phoenix
she
cried
in
a
teasing
voice
i
have
seen
you
in
so
long
illustration
good
morning
i
am
sure
the
phoenix
replied
stiffly
staring
straight
ahead
phoenix
the
lady
continued
coaxingly
i
awfully
bored
wo
you
race
me
please
idle
hands
find
mischief
to
do
said
the
phoenix
severely
are
making
good
use
of
our
time
and
i
suggest
that
do
the
same
do
be
so
stuffy
phoenix
she
pouted
come
and
race
with
me
i
got
a
new
broom
and
i
want
to
see
how
good
it
is
please
no
said
the
phoenix
sharply
oh
all
right
for
she
said
tossing
her
head
you
just
dare
because
you
know
i
beat
your
tail
feathers
off
and
she
shot
back
into
the
mist
below
indeed
the
phoenix
snorted
beat
my
tail
feathers
off
ha
is
she
a
witch
david
asked
yes
my
boy
and
a
shocking
example
of
the
decline
of
the
younger
generation
she
will
come
to
no
good
end
believe
me
tail
feathers
indeed
just
then
they
burst
out
of
the
clouds
and
into
the
hot
sunlight
below
them
the
land
was
wild
and
desolate
a
vast
rolling
plain
covered
for
the
most
part
with
dry
tawny
grass
here
and
there
were
groves
of
trees
drooping
beneath
the
sun
the
phoenix
still
snorting
indignantly
to
itself
dropped
to
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
ground
they
began
to
soar
back
and
forth
can
you
see
anything
my
boy
david
had
never
seen
a
gryffin
of
course
so
he
was
not
sure
what
to
look
for
but
he
caught
sight
of
something
lying
in
the
shade
of
a
bush
and
pointed
it
out
to
the
phoenix
ah
quite
so
the
phoenix
said
doubtfully
it
does
not
look
like
a
but
we
can
take
a
closer
look
they
landed
and
walked
toward
the
bush
in
its
shadow
sprawled
a
very
untidy
animal
its
tail
and
hindquarters
were
exactly
like
those
of
a
panther
its
chest
and
forelegs
were
like
a
hawk
and
it
had
pointed
wings
burrs
matted
its
dusty
fur
its
claws
were
shabby
and
split
and
numerous
black
flies
were
crawling
over
its
haunches
the
bush
trembled
with
its
snoring
bah
we
are
wasting
our
time
here
my
boy
this
is
a
gryffen
a
disgusting
brute
is
it
and
the
phoenix
sniffed
disapprovingly
maybe
if
we
wake
it
up
david
suggested
it
could
tell
us
where
the
other
ones
live
next
to
impossible
for
one
thing
a
cannon
could
not
awaken
the
beast
for
another
thing
it
would
not
even
if
awake
be
able
to
tell
us
anything
you
simply
can
not
imagine
the
stupidity
of
these
brutes
well
let
it
anyway
david
said
very
well
my
boy
but
it
will
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
the
phoenix
shrugged
its
shoulders
stepped
up
to
the
gryffen
and
kicked
it
violently
phoenix
david
cried
in
alarm
do
hurt
it
no
fear
said
the
phoenix
delivering
another
lusty
kick
one
simply
can
not
damage
a
sleeping
gryffen
give
me
a
hand
my
boy
david
took
hold
of
the
gryffen
wing
and
the
phoenix
seized
its
tail
for
the
next
ten
minutes
they
kicked
and
pulled
and
pounded
shouting
hey
and
wake
up
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
it
was
hot
work
and
david
finally
admitted
to
himself
that
the
phoenix
had
been
right
but
before
he
could
say
so
the
phoenix
completely
lost
its
temper
and
savagely
bit
the
gryffen
tail
that
did
it
the
gryffen
opened
one
eye
halfway
and
said
unffniph
get
up
the
phoenix
bellowed
the
gryffen
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
and
yawned
a
tremendous
and
noisy
yawn
then
it
squinted
blearily
at
david
and
murmured
what
day
is
it
illustration
wednesday
david
said
could
you
please
tell
us
oh
wednesday
said
the
gryffen
it
thought
about
this
for
a
while
mumbling
wednesday
wednesday
to
itself
it
lifted
one
leg
as
if
to
scratch
the
fly
bites
changed
its
mind
in
and
dropped
the
leg
again
oh
it
said
at
last
so
it
is
saturday
no
said
david
what
we
want
to
know
is
not
saturday
said
the
gryffen
sinking
down
to
the
ground
with
a
huge
sigh
of
relief
ah
come
back
on
saturday
saturday
afternoon
i
generally
get
up
on
saturday
in
the
afternoon
the
words
faded
into
a
snore
there
you
are
my
dear
fellow
said
the
phoenix
just
as
i
said
oaf
boor
a
annoying
animal
said
david
angrily
i
agree
my
boy
but
the
gryffins
are
different
i
assure
you
now
let
me
see
where
should
we
look
there
they
come
david
cried
suddenly
look
and
indeed
a
number
of
winged
creatures
were
loping
down
a
hillside
toward
them
good
heavens
the
phoenix
shouted
those
are
the
ones
we
do
want
to
meet
on
my
back
what
are
they
david
gasped
as
he
threw
himself
on
the
bird
back
gryffons
the
phoenix
rushed
along
the
ground
a
few
feet
and
sprang
into
the
air
but
it
was
too
late
the
foremost
gryffons
with
powerful
strokes
of
their
wings
shot
up
to
meet
them
the
phoenix
swerved
sharply
they
missed
the
snapping
beak
of
the
first
gryffon
by
half
an
inch
and
dodged
the
second
only
to
smash
into
a
third
david
was
stunned
by
the
blow
and
the
fall
when
he
regained
consciousness
he
found
himself
in
the
tight
grip
of
two
gryffons
the
phoenix
was
struggling
feebly
with
another
and
still
more
were
crowding
around
them
screaming
like
hawks
they
looked
like
the
sleeping
gryffen
but
were
as
large
as
ponies
their
eyes
were
yellow
and
unblinking
and
their
tails
twitched
like
an
angry
cat
their
smell
like
the
lion
house
in
the
zoo
made
david
feel
faint
well
phoenix
said
the
largest
gryffon
coldly
you
know
the
rule
i
believe
the
phoenix
smiled
weakly
and
cleared
its
throat
ah
there
gryffon
it
said
unsteadily
fancy
meeting
you
here
ah
ah
rule
what
rule
rule
said
the
gryffon
human
being
shall
be
allowed
to
enter
the
oh
that
rule
said
the
phoenix
with
a
careless
laugh
i
thought
everyone
knew
that
the
council
of
had
changed
it
can
it
be
that
you
have
not
yet
heard
that
wo
do
phoenix
you
have
also
heard
of
course
of
the
penalty
for
breaking
the
rule
which
you
must
suffer
along
with
this
human
boy
now
one
moment
my
dear
gryffon
i
ah
death
the
phoenix
quailed
and
david
legs
went
limp
under
him
but
they
had
no
chance
to
plead
with
the
gryffons
their
captors
formed
two
lines
one
on
each
side
of
them
and
at
a
scream
of
command
from
the
leader
all
began
to
march
the
gryffon
that
had
been
holding
the
phoenix
winked
horribly
at
david
and
made
a
gesture
with
its
wing
courage
my
boy
the
phoenix
whispered
it
is
always
darkest
before
dawn
presently
they
reached
a
hillside
david
and
the
phoenix
were
marched
up
to
a
cave
and
thrown
in
two
of
the
gryffons
sat
down
at
the
entrance
to
guard
them
while
the
others
went
off
to
consider
the
best
method
of
carrying
out
the
penalty
david
was
terribly
frightened
now
but
he
did
not
want
to
let
the
phoenix
know
it
in
a
voice
which
trembled
a
little
he
asked
what
are
we
going
to
do
the
phoenix
frowned
do
not
be
downcast
my
boy
my
brain
is
equal
to
any
occasion
i
shall
think
silence
please
and
the
phoenix
covering
its
eyes
with
one
wing
thought
to
keep
himself
occupied
david
explored
the
cave
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
the
cave
was
small
and
bare
he
tested
the
walls
thoroughly
to
see
if
there
were
any
places
where
they
might
dig
their
way
out
there
were
none
his
feet
raised
a
cloud
of
fine
dust
which
got
into
his
eyes
and
nose
and
made
him
sneeze
violently
discouraged
he
went
back
to
the
phoenix
and
sat
down
there
was
a
long
silence
gradually
an
idea
came
to
david
it
started
as
a
small
faint
thought
at
the
back
of
his
mind
wavered
began
to
grow
and
expand
and
fill
out
became
bigger
and
clearer
and
better
and
phoenix
cried
david
jumping
to
his
feet
my
boy
my
very
dear
boy
said
the
phoenix
its
voice
breaking
with
emotion
i
have
thought
i
have
pondered
i
have
well
to
be
brief
it
is
no
use
stiff
upper
lip
my
boy
we
are
doomed
phoenix
i
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
boy
even
though
it
be
your
last
one
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
ah
who
could
have
said
in
the
golden
days
of
my
youth
that
i
should
come
to
such
an
end
oh
miserable
bird
oh
unhappy
boy
phoenix
but
we
can
show
them
how
to
die
my
boy
we
still
have
that
the
last
magnificent
gesture
let
those
who
have
lived
wisely
and
well
show
that
they
can
die
in
the
same
way
i
hope
i
am
to
go
first
so
that
you
may
have
an
example
to
follow
my
boy
listen
please
and
david
whispered
in
the
phoenix
ear
the
plan
had
seemed
like
a
good
one
while
it
was
still
in
his
mind
but
put
into
words
it
sounded
a
little
too
simple
as
he
whispered
david
began
to
feel
more
and
more
foolish
so
that
finally
he
stopped
altogether
i
i
guess
it
really
kind
of
silly
he
stammered
but
the
phoenix
was
looking
at
him
with
hope
and
admiration
in
its
eyes
my
very
dear
chap
it
said
solemnly
i
salute
you
i
humbly
await
your
signal
do
you
really
think
it
will
work
my
boy
it
must
it
can
it
shall
proceed
poor
as
the
plan
now
seemed
to
david
he
prepared
to
carry
it
out
holding
his
breath
so
as
not
to
sneeze
again
he
scooped
up
as
much
dust
as
he
could
hold
in
two
hands
then
he
took
his
position
on
one
side
of
the
cave
nodded
the
phoenix
toward
the
other
and
glanced
out
to
see
if
the
guardian
gryffons
were
looking
they
were
not
now
he
whispered
the
cave
rocked
with
their
uproar
david
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
kicked
the
walls
the
phoenix
let
out
a
series
of
whistles
and
squawks
and
beat
its
wings
frantically
echoes
bounced
from
wall
to
wall
the
two
gryffons
came
rushing
into
the
cave
adding
to
the
racket
with
their
shrieking
now
david
shouted
and
he
flung
the
double
handful
of
dust
into
the
faces
instantly
they
were
all
choking
and
sneezing
in
the
thick
cloud
he
plunged
between
the
legs
of
the
two
gryffons
who
in
the
confusion
began
to
bite
and
tear
savagely
at
each
other
david
and
the
phoenix
burst
out
of
the
cave
together
the
other
gryffons
aroused
by
the
noise
were
bounding
toward
them
david
flung
himself
on
the
phoenix
back
and
shouted
fly
and
sneezed
from
somewhere
behind
him
a
set
of
talons
snatched
out
and
ripped
through
the
back
of
his
shirt
he
kicked
blindly
and
felt
his
foot
crunch
into
something
which
shrieked
fly
phoenix
he
sobbed
the
phoenix
was
already
in
the
air
and
needed
no
encouragement
they
heard
raucous
cries
and
the
thunder
of
wings
behind
them
david
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
the
gryffons
were
rising
from
the
ground
in
pursuit
their
legs
drawn
up
under
them
and
their
wings
beating
faster
he
screamed
illustration
you
have
seen
nothing
in
the
way
of
flying
until
now
my
boy
the
phoenix
shouted
back
watch
this
its
wings
were
two
blurs
slicing
through
the
air
and
roaring
like
kettledrums
the
ground
below
streamed
backwards
david
looked
back
again
the
gryffons
were
falling
into
the
distance
their
cries
were
getting
fainter
now
they
looked
like
a
flock
of
starlings
now
like
a
cluster
of
flies
now
like
gnats
and
then
they
had
faded
out
of
sight
and
david
and
the
phoenix
were
streaking
over
the
grassland
alone
ten
minutes
later
they
reached
a
shore
and
landed
they
flopped
on
the
sand
panting
and
david
suddenly
feeling
very
faint
closed
his
eyes
and
put
his
head
between
his
knees
after
they
had
got
their
breath
the
phoenix
patted
david
on
the
shoulder
and
said
huskily
i
congratulate
you
my
boy
your
plan
was
magnificent
precisely
what
should
have
done
had
i
thought
of
it
first
needless
to
say
we
shall
not
go
on
looking
for
the
gryffins
but
now
you
know
exactly
what
they
are
like
midway
in
size
between
the
gryffens
and
gryffons
and
reddish
in
color
most
amiable
souls
willing
to
do
anything
for
anyone
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
they
are
all
related
but
enough
my
boy
let
us
go
home
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
ledge
the
phoenix
put
david
down
and
prepared
to
take
off
again
where
are
you
going
phoenix
david
asked
some
business
to
attend
to
my
boy
muttering
under
its
breath
something
that
sounded
like
tail
feathers
indeed
the
phoenix
soared
off
and
david
stiff
and
sore
and
thoroughly
tired
started
down
the
mountainside
for
home
which
the
scientist
arrives
in
pursuit
of
the
phoenix
and
there
are
alarums
and
excursions
by
illustration
the
lights
downstairs
were
all
on
when
david
got
home
and
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
front
door
he
could
tell
that
they
had
company
he
shouted
i
home
and
sneezed
the
dust
from
the
gryffons
cave
still
clung
to
him
tickling
his
nose
well
here
he
is
at
last
said
dad
voice
come
on
in
david
then
as
david
walked
into
the
living
room
good
heavens
son
happened
to
you
your
david
mother
said
in
a
horrified
voice
your
poor
back
what
to
you
illustration
david
felt
himself
the
back
of
his
shirt
was
ripped
to
tatters
and
there
were
three
lines
of
caked
blood
across
his
shoulders
he
remembered
now
it
was
the
gryffon
that
had
tried
to
grab
him
as
he
and
the
phoenix
made
their
escape
but
he
had
promised
the
phoenix
to
keep
its
secret
he
stammered
i
i
had
an
accident
and
dust
all
you
mother
went
on
well
said
david
desperately
it
was
a
accident
it
seems
to
have
been
very
dusty
indeed
said
a
third
voice
there
was
a
loud
sneeze
david
father
jumped
up
you
gave
me
such
a
shock
when
you
came
in
that
i
almost
forgot
david
we
have
a
guest
and
he
introduced
david
to
a
very
tall
thin
man
with
a
bald
head
his
face
and
neck
were
burnt
red
by
the
sun
and
he
had
on
a
pair
of
thick
glasses
which
made
his
pale
eyes
look
immense
for
some
reason
david
took
an
instant
dislike
to
him
but
he
shook
hands
politely
and
said
how
do
you
do
david
eh
said
the
man
well
well
are
you
a
good
boy
david
of
all
the
stupid
questions
in
the
world
that
was
the
one
david
hated
most
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
looked
the
other
way
david
dear
said
mother
with
an
awkward
laugh
i
think
better
go
upstairs
and
wash
and
change
when
david
came
into
the
living
room
again
the
guest
was
talking
excitedly
completely
unknown
to
man
he
was
saying
it
the
discovery
of
the
age
my
name
will
be
famous
if
i
succeed
in
my
plans
how
fascinating
mother
said
and
to
think
of
it
happening
right
here
and
it
huge
the
guest
said
simply
huge
and
brilliantly
colored
for
a
scientist
like
myself
it
more
than
fascinating
david
was
listening
now
scientist
his
heart
missed
a
beat
and
he
choked
oh
no
it
could
be
scientist
could
it
david
here
spends
all
his
time
up
on
the
mountain
his
father
said
maybe
he
seen
it
the
guest
turned
his
big
pale
unpleasant
eyes
on
david
well
david
he
said
maybe
you
can
help
me
now
have
you
seen
anything
unusual
on
the
mountain
unusual
said
david
unsteadily
there
was
a
pain
in
his
chest
from
the
pounding
of
his
heart
yes
david
the
guest
went
on
unusual
so
unusual
that
you
could
miss
it
a
very
large
bird
with
bright
plumage
the
floor
under
david
seemed
to
rock
it
was
true
then
it
was
horribly
true
this
was
the
scientist
who
had
been
chasing
the
phoenix
this
was
their
enemy
bird
david
dodged
there
are
lots
of
birds
up
there
sparrows
and
meadow
larks
and
and
sparrows
but
nothing
like
a
huge
bird
with
bright
feathers
well
he
would
have
to
tell
a
lie
after
all
it
was
for
the
sake
no
said
david
ah
said
the
scientist
but
his
cold
eyes
bored
into
david
for
another
instant
plainly
saying
i
not
fooled
young
man
it
odd
he
continued
that
no
one
has
seen
it
but
i
have
no
doubt
it
somewhere
here
i
am
going
to
begin
my
search
as
soon
as
my
equipment
gets
here
tell
us
about
it
said
mother
politely
well
i
discovered
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
you
know
said
the
scientist
eagerly
quite
by
accident
i
was
really
looking
for
another
species
now
birds
you
know
have
fixed
habits
if
you
know
those
habits
you
can
predict
just
what
they
will
do
at
any
time
this
particular
bird
was
a
daytime
creature
so
i
tried
to
watch
it
between
dawn
and
dusk
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
mind
of
its
own
you
might
almost
say
an
intelligence
it
avoided
me
in
a
very
clever
way
and
it
avoided
my
traps
also
uncanny
so
after
several
weeks
i
decided
to
shoot
it
if
i
got
the
chance
then
suddenly
it
disappeared
but
i
certain
it
came
over
to
this
side
of
the
valley
there
was
no
escape
from
the
subject
during
dinner
the
scientist
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
he
described
the
merits
of
deadfalls
snares
steel
traps
and
birdlime
he
asked
which
they
thought
would
make
the
best
bait
a
rabbit
a
beefsteak
a
live
lamb
or
carrion
he
told
them
all
about
the
new
rifle
which
he
had
ordered
and
he
vowed
to
them
all
that
he
would
not
rest
until
the
bird
was
either
caught
or
killed
for
the
advancement
of
human
learning
david
listened
with
horror
the
dinner
before
him
went
untouched
his
only
thought
was
that
now
he
would
have
to
warn
the
phoenix
as
soon
as
possible
the
phoenix
would
go
to
south
america
after
all
and
his
education
would
end
before
it
had
even
started
all
because
of
this
hateful
man
he
fought
to
hold
back
his
tears
dinner
was
over
at
last
david
mumbled
his
excuses
and
ducked
out
of
the
dining
room
but
aunt
amy
seized
him
firmly
just
as
he
thought
he
had
got
away
bedtime
for
you
david
she
said
firmly
oh
aunt
amy
please
i
got
to
upstairs
young
man
you
had
enough
gallivanting
around
for
one
day
you
all
worn
out
i
said
david
struggling
i
feel
fine
look
i
just
to
it
was
useless
she
marched
him
upstairs
to
his
room
and
stood
in
the
doorway
until
he
had
undressed
and
put
on
his
pajamas
and
got
into
bed
now
she
said
you
go
to
sleep
the
mountain
will
still
be
there
in
the
morning
unless
there
a
landslide
good
night
and
she
turned
out
the
light
and
shut
the
door
this
was
awful
he
could
not
sneak
downstairs
because
the
stairs
could
be
seen
from
the
living
room
he
could
not
climb
out
of
his
window
because
a
rose
arbor
was
directly
beneath
it
and
he
would
be
ripped
by
the
thorns
and
mother
always
came
in
to
say
good
night
before
she
went
to
bed
if
he
was
not
there
when
she
came
in
tonight
there
would
be
a
lot
of
unpleasant
explaining
to
do
the
only
thing
then
was
to
wait
until
the
scientist
went
home
and
everyone
was
in
bed
it
was
a
maddening
wait
the
scientist
voice
went
on
and
on
like
the
drone
of
an
electric
fan
interrupted
only
by
an
occasional
murmur
from
mother
or
dad
for
a
while
david
sat
in
bed
twisting
the
sheets
in
his
hands
then
he
got
up
and
paced
the
room
in
his
bare
feet
it
seemed
to
him
that
three
or
four
whole
nighttimes
had
passed
before
he
finally
heard
all
three
voices
raised
and
talking
at
once
the
scientist
was
going
now
they
were
saying
at
the
front
door
now
the
door
was
being
closed
now
there
were
footsteps
on
the
stairs
he
jumped
into
bed
just
before
mother
put
her
head
in
and
said
good
night
dear
david
murmured
pretending
to
be
half
asleep
his
door
closed
again
the
light
switches
snapped
and
there
was
silence
he
waited
another
half
hour
to
make
sure
everyone
was
asleep
as
quickly
and
silently
as
he
could
he
pulled
on
his
clothes
crept
out
of
his
room
and
slid
cautiously
down
the
bannister
in
the
back
yard
he
put
on
his
shoes
dived
through
the
hedge
and
started
to
race
up
the
mountainside
fortunately
there
was
a
moon
and
no
clouds
in
the
sky
but
even
with
this
light
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
to
the
trail
several
times
he
lost
his
way
so
that
the
trip
took
much
longer
than
usual
but
he
found
the
ledge
at
last
climbed
over
the
final
difficult
rock
and
sat
down
to
catch
his
breath
when
he
could
speak
he
called
softly
phoenix
there
was
no
answer
phoenix
he
pushed
through
the
thicket
to
the
other
side
of
the
ledge
the
phoenix
was
gone
the
tears
that
had
been
stopped
up
all
evening
could
be
held
no
longer
david
dropped
to
the
ground
leaned
his
forehead
against
a
rock
and
let
them
go
he
had
just
remembered
as
soon
as
they
had
come
back
from
the
gryffon
adventure
the
phoenix
had
flown
off
on
some
sort
of
business
and
it
had
not
said
when
it
would
return
the
tears
cleared
david
mind
and
made
him
feel
better
now
what
he
began
to
think
if
he
stayed
on
the
ledge
all
night
they
might
find
out
at
home
and
make
a
terrible
fuss
but
if
he
did
not
warn
the
phoenix
before
morning
the
scientist
might
creep
up
while
the
bird
was
resting
and
trap
it
or
shoot
it
so
he
would
have
to
warn
the
phoenix
return
home
and
the
only
way
to
do
both
these
things
was
to
write
the
phoenix
a
note
but
he
had
neither
paper
nor
pencil
a
fine
mess
he
had
made
of
everything
now
he
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
home
write
the
note
come
all
the
way
back
up
to
the
ledge
and
then
go
home
again
david
trudged
down
the
mountainside
in
a
very
low
mood
now
that
he
had
a
definite
plan
to
work
on
his
fear
was
gone
but
he
felt
that
he
had
been
pretty
stupid
to
rush
off
without
thinking
of
everything
first
in
his
mind
he
could
hear
the
phoenix
saying
look
before
you
leap
my
boy
and
other
wise
words
of
advice
and
he
had
cried
too
lucky
that
no
one
had
been
there
to
see
as
he
approached
the
house
he
was
surprised
to
see
all
the
lights
ablaze
and
to
hear
his
name
being
called
he
thought
they
found
out
i
gone
here
i
am
he
shouted
opening
the
door
what
the
matter
it
was
a
strange
sight
which
met
him
inside
dad
in
his
gray
pajamas
was
waving
a
revolver
and
making
fierce
noises
mother
looking
frightened
had
a
shoe
in
one
hand
aunt
amy
with
her
hair
in
rags
was
also
with
a
big
frying
pan
beckie
was
howling
upstairs
david
mother
cried
are
you
all
right
where
have
you
been
did
he
hurt
you
who
said
david
i
all
right
what
the
matter
the
burglar
said
mother
excitedly
he
put
his
head
in
the
window
and
said
i
tell
you
burglars
do
say
dad
said
they
try
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
just
let
me
catch
him
doing
it
again
he
added
waving
his
pistol
running
around
on
that
mountain
at
all
hours
of
the
night
aunt
amy
grumbled
with
burglars
and
i
do
know
loose
in
town
and
then
we
found
that
you
were
gone
and
we
thought
he
had
stolen
you
mother
went
on
where
have
you
been
i
could
sleep
said
david
so
i
went
for
a
walk
well
thank
heavens
you
safe
said
mother
hankering
after
that
mountain
all
night
aunt
amy
muttered
as
if
he
was
up
there
all
day
look
here
son
said
dad
what
do
you
know
about
this
honestly
dad
said
david
i
could
sleep
there
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
ca
help
it
if
i
ca
sleep
so
i
took
a
walk
nothing
wrong
with
oh
all
right
all
right
his
father
said
i
suppose
it
just
a
coincidence
let
all
get
back
to
sleep
and
david
the
next
time
you
ca
sleep
try
counting
sheep
gradually
the
house
calmed
down
beckie
stopped
wailing
dad
put
away
his
gun
good
nights
were
said
the
lights
were
turned
off
david
knew
that
it
would
be
at
least
an
hour
before
he
dared
to
move
again
and
he
would
have
to
be
doubly
careful
this
time
and
he
was
a
little
nervous
himself
now
about
that
burglar
what
if
he
should
meet
him
when
he
went
out
again
he
tried
to
forget
about
that
by
thinking
of
what
he
would
put
in
the
note
for
the
phoenix
he
had
got
as
far
as
dear
phoenix
and
was
wondering
how
you
spelled
phoenix
when
there
came
a
swish
and
a
thump
at
his
window
followed
by
a
cautious
whisper
david
felt
his
scalp
prickle
that
he
quavered
is
that
you
my
boy
whispered
a
familiar
guarded
voice
ah
thank
heavens
and
the
phoenix
crawled
through
the
window
weak
with
relief
david
snapped
on
the
bedside
light
the
phoenix
presented
a
shocking
sight
its
face
was
drawn
with
fatigue
and
it
looked
rather
draggled
its
back
sagged
its
wings
drooped
to
the
floor
and
it
walked
with
a
limp
illustration
oh
phoenix
phoenix
david
whispered
he
jumped
to
support
the
bird
before
it
collapsed
entirely
ah
thank
you
my
boy
the
phoenix
murmured
your
bed
i
presume
may
i
thank
you
the
springs
creaked
under
its
weight
as
the
phoenix
gingerly
lay
down
what
a
night
my
boy
a
night
it
sighed
weakly
closing
its
eyes
oh
phoenix
what
happened
can
i
do
anything
for
you
david
whispered
a
damp
cooling
cloth
upon
my
forehead
would
be
welcome
my
boy
murmured
the
phoenix
also
a
bit
of
nourishment
david
slid
down
the
bannister
got
a
handful
of
cookies
and
a
glass
of
milk
and
dampened
a
dish
towel
when
he
returned
the
phoenix
was
fast
asleep
phoenix
he
whispered
wake
up
here
your
the
phoenix
awoke
with
a
violent
start
and
stared
wildly
around
the
room
trapped
it
muttered
making
a
frenzied
effort
to
get
off
the
bed
not
so
david
whispered
sharply
it
me
understanding
dawned
in
the
phoenix
eyes
and
it
eased
itself
back
with
a
sigh
ah
you
my
boy
you
gave
me
quite
a
fright
i
thought
but
here
the
phoenix
caught
sight
of
the
milk
and
cookies
and
sat
up
again
ambrosia
it
sighed
reverently
and
nectar
you
a
prince
my
dear
fellow
and
the
phoenix
reached
out
eagerly
now
phoenix
david
whispered
as
he
wrapped
the
wet
towel
around
the
phoenix
head
what
happened
ah
that
feels
heavenly
my
boy
munch
munch
what
has
happened
munch
munch
gulp
i
was
insulted
i
accepted
a
challenge
and
i
brilliantly
maintained
my
honor
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
boy
death
before
dishonor
yes
in
spite
of
my
age
i
but
phoenix
what
to
be
brief
then
my
boy
for
brevity
is
the
soul
of
wit
although
i
am
not
trying
to
be
witty
now
i
am
simply
too
worn
out
brevity
ah
where
was
i
i
you
were
telling
me
what
happened
to
you
tonight
david
said
ah
yes
quite
so
well
i
raced
the
witch
to
put
it
quite
simply
oh
phoenix
did
you
win
she
said
that
she
would
my
tail
feathers
off
did
she
not
behold
my
dear
fellow
every
tail
feather
intact
good
for
you
phoenix
how
did
it
go
i
found
her
somewhere
over
scotland
and
accepted
her
challenge
we
jockeyed
about
for
starting
positions
and
she
insulted
me
by
offering
me
a
handicap
which
of
course
i
refused
for
several
hundred
miles
it
was
nip
and
tuck
as
it
were
then
over
luxembourg
i
put
all
my
energies
into
a
magnificent
sprint
and
won
the
race
by
three
and
a
half
broom
lengths
she
claimed
a
foul
and
went
off
in
a
fit
of
sulks
of
course
i
never
saw
a
witch
who
was
a
good
loser
and
i
well
the
fact
is
my
boy
that
i
am
not
as
young
as
i
used
to
be
i
simply
home
oh
you
poor
phoenix
but
you
won
though
good
for
you
phoenix
i
proud
of
you
i
did
like
her
at
all
there
you
are
i
had
to
win
for
both
of
us
now
as
i
wended
my
weary
way
homeward
i
realized
that
i
should
be
too
tired
to
go
traveling
tomorrow
so
i
decided
to
tell
you
in
case
you
should
want
to
do
something
else
during
the
day
but
i
did
not
know
which
house
was
yours
i
had
to
pick
one
at
random
i
thrust
my
head
in
a
window
and
uttered
a
cautious
imagine
my
dismay
when
i
was
answered
by
a
piercing
scream
i
had
to
beat
a
hasty
and
undignified
retreat
into
a
garage
until
all
was
peaceful
again
then
i
did
the
same
thing
at
the
next
house
and
the
next
with
the
same
results
the
phoenix
sighed
would
you
believe
it
my
boy
this
is
the
fifth
house
i
tried
but
i
knew
i
was
on
the
right
track
when
i
heard
them
calling
for
you
oh
so
it
was
said
david
you
almost
frightened
mother
to
death
she
thought
you
were
a
burglar
my
dear
fellow
i
am
really
sorry
for
having
caused
any
misunderstanding
or
fright
said
the
phoenix
apologetically
it
was
just
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
of
my
victory
that
is
to
tell
you
that
i
should
be
indisposed
tomorrow
then
david
recalled
that
he
had
something
to
say
too
the
shock
of
remembering
was
such
that
he
blurted
out
the
news
without
thinking
of
softening
the
blow
phoenix
listen
the
scientist
is
here
the
phoenix
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
jerk
and
david
barely
suppressed
its
startled
exclamation
by
clamping
a
hand
over
its
beak
it
not
so
bad
yet
he
whispered
hurriedly
because
he
not
sure
where
you
are
and
he
has
to
wait
for
his
equipment
to
get
here
but
oh
phoenix
now
i
suppose
you
go
to
south
america
after
all
and
i
wo
have
any
more
education
the
phoenix
leaped
to
its
feet
and
struck
a
defiant
pose
my
boy
it
said
angrily
you
are
mistaken
i
refuse
to
be
chased
around
any
longer
even
the
lowly
worm
turns
am
i
a
mouse
or
am
i
the
phoenix
if
that
insufferable
man
wishes
to
pursue
me
further
if
he
can
not
mind
his
own
business
then
by
jove
we
shall
meet
him
face
to
face
and
fight
to
the
finish
its
voice
which
had
been
getting
louder
and
louder
ended
in
an
indignant
squawk
its
battle
cry
as
it
explained
later
warning
was
too
late
they
heard
rapid
footsteps
and
the
sound
of
light
switches
snapping
quick
david
said
out
the
window
with
a
hasty
farewell
my
boy
the
phoenix
plunged
headlong
toward
the
window
and
tripped
over
the
sill
there
was
a
resounding
crash
outside
as
the
bird
landed
on
the
rose
arbor
a
brief
but
furious
thrashing
and
muttering
and
then
the
receding
flurry
of
wings
dad
burst
into
the
room
with
his
revolver
followed
by
mother
and
aunt
amy
with
two
frying
pans
this
time
he
stuck
his
head
in
the
window
and
said
at
me
david
cried
a
big
dark
shape
in
the
window
this
time
dad
telephoned
the
police
in
no
time
at
all
three
carloads
of
weary
policemen
were
swarming
over
the
house
and
yard
with
guns
and
flashlights
drawn
it
was
the
fifth
or
was
it
the
sixth
call
they
had
received
from
the
neighborhood
that
night
they
explained
there
followed
an
hour
of
questions
arguments
and
theories
during
which
everyone
became
very
excited
everyone
that
is
except
david
although
he
acted
excited
to
avoid
suspicion
but
he
was
happy
he
had
warned
the
phoenix
the
phoenix
was
going
to
stay
and
there
was
nothing
to
worry
about
until
tomorrow
which
the
phoenix
has
a
plan
and
david
and
the
phoenix
call
on
a
sea
illustration
well
you
in
all
the
papers
this
morning
phoenix
said
david
as
he
sat
down
beside
the
reclining
bird
next
morning
they
do
know
who
you
are
but
they
all
talking
about
what
happened
last
night
they
call
you
the
burglar
the
police
are
pretty
worried
my
dear
chap
said
the
phoenix
apologetically
let
me
repeat
my
sincere
regrets
for
causing
alarm
it
was
not
my
desire
to
the
did
you
say
have
they
discovered
any
clues
no
said
david
reassuringly
they
ca
find
a
thing
they
think
the
whispering
burglar
climbed
up
a
ladder
to
say
into
the
upstairs
windows
only
they
ca
find
the
ladder
they
call
it
the
mystery
clue
the
phoenix
gazed
at
the
sky
and
mused
in
all
the
papers
you
say
well
fame
at
last
although
hardly
the
kind
i
had
expected
what
a
pity
that
there
can
be
no
photographs
with
the
story
imagine
a
picture
of
me
on
the
front
page
a
profile
perhaps
or
would
a
shot
be
more
effective
or
both
let
us
say
with
i
know
you
look
very
handsome
phoenix
david
interrupted
but
what
we
be
thinking
about
is
the
scientist
what
are
we
going
to
do
oh
said
the
phoenix
i
was
coming
to
that
my
boy
the
battle
is
already
half
won
i
have
a
plan
good
for
you
phoenix
what
is
it
aha
said
the
phoenix
with
a
mysterious
smile
all
will
unfold
in
time
rest
assured
that
the
plan
is
brilliant
in
one
stroke
of
genius
it
solves
everything
tactics
my
boy
napoleon
had
nothing
on
me
but
what
it
phoenix
tut
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
in
a
maddening
way
control
your
impatience
you
will
see
now
we
shall
have
to
buy
some
things
so
we
shall
need
money
let
me
see
several
of
the
leprechauns
have
large
pots
of
gold
no
i
fear
they
would
not
part
with
so
much
as
a
penny
tightfisted
my
dear
fellow
you
never
saw
such
misers
hmmm
well
there
are
the
dragons
of
course
they
guard
heaps
of
treasure
in
caves
but
no
they
are
excellent
chaps
in
most
respects
but
frightfully
stuffy
about
loans
and
gifts
no
the
djinn
no
his
money
is
all
tied
up
in
arabian
oil
speculation
aha
why
did
i
think
of
that
before
the
sea
monster
of
course
do
sea
monsters
have
money
asked
david
no
but
the
sea
monster
should
know
where
pirate
treasure
is
buried
quite
in
its
nautical
line
we
shall
visit
the
monster
my
boy
tomorrow
of
course
i
could
not
fly
a
foot
today
to
save
my
life
my
muscles
are
killing
me
oh
poor
phoenix
david
said
but
he
was
so
excited
that
he
could
not
feel
much
pity
pirate
treasure
they
were
going
to
dig
for
pirate
treasure
we
shall
need
a
spade
i
trust
you
will
arrange
for
it
my
boy
of
course
phoenix
said
david
jumping
to
his
feet
i
get
everything
ready
right
away
do
move
till
i
get
back
impossible
my
boy
the
phoenix
groaned
as
it
shifted
into
a
more
comfortable
position
david
raced
home
to
collect
the
necessary
things
for
the
trip
remembering
how
cold
it
had
been
last
time
he
took
his
leather
jacket
out
of
the
closet
and
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
scarf
for
the
phoenix
he
borrowed
a
bottle
of
liniment
and
took
all
the
cookies
from
the
cooky
jar
and
he
picked
the
shortest
of
three
spades
in
the
garage
during
the
rest
of
the
day
he
massaged
the
phoenix
back
and
wings
with
the
liniment
he
was
exploding
with
curiosity
about
the
plan
of
course
but
the
phoenix
would
only
smile
its
smuggest
smile
and
tell
him
to
wait
and
see
wait
and
see
which
almost
drove
david
mad
tomorrow
took
its
time
the
way
it
always
does
when
you
are
anxious
to
see
it
arrive
but
it
finally
came
and
david
found
himself
with
the
spade
held
tightly
under
one
arm
his
jacket
zipped
up
to
his
chin
gloves
on
and
scarf
knotted
all
ready
to
go
to
the
west
this
time
said
the
phoenix
as
david
got
up
on
its
back
this
is
the
monster
pacific
season
you
know
ready
my
boy
splendid
we
are
off
over
the
mountains
and
desert
they
sped
over
the
shore
out
across
the
ocean
for
a
long
time
they
hurtled
through
a
huge
blue
loneliness
dark
blue
below
lighter
blue
above
once
they
passed
over
a
ship
a
pencil
dot
trailing
a
of
white
another
time
they
startled
a
albatross
which
gave
a
frightened
squawk
and
plunged
down
out
of
sight
with
folded
wings
aside
from
that
there
was
nothing
to
see
until
they
reached
the
islands
the
phoenix
slowed
down
to
a
glide
and
dropped
lower
these
are
the
coral
atolls
of
the
pacific
my
boy
it
called
over
its
shoulder
that
lake
in
the
center
of
each
island
is
called
the
lagoon
david
was
enchanted
by
the
atolls
they
were
made
of
tiny
islets
strung
together
like
the
beads
of
a
necklace
and
the
colors
the
dark
blue
of
the
sea
became
lighter
around
the
islands
melting
from
sapphire
to
turquoise
to
jade
the
atolls
were
ringed
with
dazzling
white
surf
and
beach
and
they
all
had
cool
green
swaths
of
palm
trees
and
underbrush
and
each
lagoon
also
had
its
varying
shades
of
blue
like
the
outer
sea
i
fear
we
may
have
trouble
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
as
they
scanned
the
empty
beaches
the
monster
shifts
about
from
island
to
island
to
avoid
discovery
we
shall
just
have
to
search
and
search
they
did
atoll
after
atoll
until
at
the
end
of
an
hour
they
were
rewarded
david
suddenly
spotted
a
dark
object
stretched
out
on
the
beach
of
a
lagoon
and
at
the
same
time
the
phoenix
said
aha
triumphantly
they
began
to
spiral
down
the
sea
monster
was
immense
its
body
could
have
filled
the
living
room
at
home
its
neck
was
twenty
feet
long
and
so
was
its
tail
which
ended
in
a
barbed
point
it
had
huge
flippers
and
its
polished
brown
hide
was
made
up
of
scales
as
big
as
dinner
plates
wake
up
monster
the
phoenix
cried
we
the
next
instant
they
were
lost
in
a
cloud
of
flying
sand
and
spray
through
which
could
be
heard
a
prodigious
splash
when
it
had
cleared
they
found
themselves
alone
on
the
beach
the
only
sign
of
the
sea
monster
was
a
great
furrow
in
the
sand
which
led
down
to
the
agitated
water
golly
that
was
fast
david
marveled
as
they
shook
the
sand
from
themselves
do
you
think
it
come
back
phoenix
of
course
my
boy
curiosity
if
nothing
else
will
bring
it
up
again
in
the
meantime
we
might
as
well
sit
down
and
wait
they
sat
down
and
waited
david
took
off
his
jacket
for
fifteen
minutes
they
heard
nothing
but
the
murmuring
of
the
surf
and
the
rustling
clatter
of
palm
fronds
at
last
there
was
a
slight
splashing
noise
from
the
lagoon
there
david
whispered
pointing
thirty
feet
offshore
an
ear
was
being
thrust
cautiously
above
the
rippled
surface
it
twitched
once
or
twice
then
pointed
quiveringly
in
their
direction
come
out
monster
the
phoenix
shouted
it
is
i
the
phoenix
the
sea
monster
head
appeared
slowly
followed
by
several
yards
of
neck
it
peered
at
them
weaving
its
head
from
side
to
side
to
get
a
better
view
david
saw
that
it
had
two
short
straight
horns
just
in
front
of
its
ears
eyes
that
were
soft
and
cowlike
and
a
most
expressive
set
of
whiskers
the
whiskers
were
now
at
a
doubtful
angle
ah
phoenix
said
the
sea
monster
at
last
in
a
mild
voice
you
remember
to
wake
me
a
bit
more
gently
i
thought
you
were
come
on
out
said
the
phoenix
firmly
and
stop
looking
like
a
lost
sheep
uh
what
about
uh
that
said
the
sea
monster
hesitantly
pointing
one
ear
at
david
this
said
the
phoenix
is
david
he
is
getting
an
education
i
assure
you
that
he
will
not
bite
the
sea
monster
swam
toward
them
heaved
itself
out
of
the
water
and
offered
its
huge
flipper
for
david
to
shake
illustration
sorry
i
rushed
off
like
that
it
said
the
trouble
is
i
had
such
a
bad
case
of
war
nerves
why
sometimes
i
jump
out
of
my
skin
at
nothing
at
all
were
you
in
the
war
david
asked
ah
i
sighed
the
sea
monster
it
flopped
down
comfortably
on
its
belly
curled
its
tail
around
its
front
flippers
and
sighed
again
but
david
noticed
that
its
whiskers
had
perked
up
to
a
quite
cheerful
angle
the
sea
monster
was
obviously
delighted
to
have
someone
listen
to
its
troubles
yes
it
said
heaving
a
third
sigh
i
was
from
the
very
beginning
much
against
my
will
guns
all
over
the
place
terrible
did
they
shoot
you
david
asked
horrified
well
me
anyway
i
thankful
to
say
they
never
hit
me
but
there
were
some
pretty
near
misses
all
the
oceans
were
simply
packed
with
ships
i
could
lift
my
head
out
of
water
without
bringing
down
a
perfect
rain
of
shells
and
bullets
the
thing
in
that
case
the
phoenix
broke
in
with
a
sniff
would
have
been
to
stay
water
thank
you
phoenix
said
the
sea
monster
dryly
but
i
like
to
breathe
now
and
then
anyway
i
was
safe
even
under
water
drop
depth
charges
on
me
one
ship
even
launched
a
torpedo
at
me
how
awful
said
david
tut
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
i
have
no
doubt
our
friend
is
stretching
the
truth
shamelessly
you
need
not
look
so
smug
monster
you
were
not
the
only
one
in
the
war
have
gone
through
fire
a
number
of
times
some
of
it
was
very
severe
in
fact
once
i
once
i
had
the
whole
north
atlantic
fleet
after
the
sea
monster
interrupted
proudly
and
remember
the
war
said
the
phoenix
which
i
daresay
you
do
well
uh
no
i
do
there
you
are
the
phoenix
crowed
the
sea
monster
looking
rather
ruffled
pointedly
turned
from
the
phoenix
and
said
to
david
what
should
you
like
to
do
david
david
suddenly
remembered
what
they
had
come
for
and
the
excitement
rushed
back
into
his
heart
he
opened
his
mouth
to
cry
we
want
to
dig
for
treasure
and
then
stopped
short
asking
for
money
he
knew
was
an
impolite
thing
to
do
especially
from
someone
you
had
only
just
met
and
there
was
no
telling
how
the
sea
monster
might
feel
about
people
nosing
around
for
its
treasure
so
he
looked
at
the
phoenix
and
waited
for
it
to
speak
the
phoenix
caught
david
glance
cleared
its
throat
several
times
and
looked
apologetically
at
the
sea
monster
monster
old
chap
it
said
soothingly
i
am
deeply
sorry
for
having
doubted
you
just
now
deeply
sorry
quite
all
right
said
the
sea
monster
stiffly
yes
the
phoenix
continued
we
both
know
that
you
have
passed
through
perilous
times
through
dangers
which
i
must
confess
would
have
left
a
shattered
wreck
the
sea
monster
sighed
sadly
but
its
whiskers
were
beginning
to
rise
again
the
monster
bears
up
very
well
under
this
fearful
strain
do
you
think
so
my
boy
a
splendid
example
for
the
rest
of
us
magnificent
the
sea
monster
whiskers
were
quivering
with
pleasure
monster
old
chap
old
friend
you
were
never
one
to
let
a
boon
companion
down
if
i
have
said
it
once
i
have
said
it
a
hundred
times
sea
monster
i
have
said
sea
monster
is
the
helpful
sort
mention
the
words
staunch
friend
i
have
said
immediately
the
sea
monster
comes
to
mind
the
phoenix
reached
up
one
wing
and
began
to
pat
the
sea
flipper
monster
old
chum
we
ah
we
well
the
plain
fact
is
that
we
ah
we
have
need
of
such
a
trifling
matter
here
the
phoenix
gave
a
careless
laugh
that
i
should
not
really
bring
it
up
at
all
ah
we
need
a
bit
of
money
oh
said
the
sea
monster
its
whiskers
sagged
now
please
do
not
be
offended
monster
said
the
phoenix
hastily
after
all
you
have
no
need
for
the
treasure
and
it
does
absolutely
no
good
buried
under
the
ground
it
does
do
any
harm
there
either
said
the
sea
monster
really
phoenix
i
never
thought
monster
said
the
phoenix
solemnly
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
life
or
death
ha
please
monster
said
david
it
really
is
life
or
death
because
the
scientist
is
chasing
the
phoenix
and
the
phoenix
has
a
plan
to
escape
him
and
we
need
some
money
to
carry
out
the
plan
so
the
scientist
ca
hurt
the
phoenix
a
few
small
coins
will
do
added
the
phoenix
with
a
winning
smile
a
louis
for
example
or
some
pieces
of
eight
after
which
you
may
bury
the
rest
again
monster
david
begged
the
monster
looked
at
david
and
at
the
phoenix
and
then
at
david
again
and
then
at
the
lagoon
it
sighed
a
very
doubtful
sigh
oh
all
right
it
said
reluctantly
but
for
goodness
sake
go
telling
anyone
where
you
found
it
of
course
not
said
the
phoenix
and
david
leaped
up
and
shouted
hooray
and
grabbed
the
spade
and
his
jacket
the
stuff
is
on
the
next
island
said
the
sea
monster
i
can
swim
over
with
you
two
on
my
back
this
way
please
we
have
to
leave
from
the
outer
beach
the
sea
monster
was
a
magnificent
swimmer
its
neck
cut
through
the
water
like
the
stem
of
a
viking
ship
and
it
left
a
frothing
wake
behind
every
once
in
a
while
it
would
plunge
its
head
into
the
water
and
come
up
with
a
fish
which
it
would
swallow
whole
should
you
like
some
breakfast
david
said
the
sea
monster
illustration
no
thank
you
david
answered
but
you
go
right
ahead
phoenix
he
added
what
you
doing
the
phoenix
which
had
been
walking
up
and
down
with
its
wings
clasped
behind
its
back
stopped
and
gazed
over
the
sea
pacing
the
my
boy
scanning
the
horizon
that
is
what
one
usually
does
at
sea
i
believe
you
be
wanting
us
to
call
you
admiral
next
said
the
sea
monster
acidly
they
steamed
on
twenty
minutes
and
large
breakfast
fish
later
they
sighted
the
island
a
little
smudge
on
the
horizon
dead
ahead
land
ho
a
voice
croaked
thank
heavens
david
turned
in
surprise
the
phoenix
was
no
longer
pacing
the
and
scanning
the
horizon
it
was
sitting
limply
with
its
head
down
and
a
glassy
stare
in
its
eyes
illustration
you
had
better
hurry
up
david
said
to
the
sea
monster
i
think
the
phoenix
is
seasick
am
not
the
phoenix
gasped
merely
ulp
temporary
the
sea
monster
turned
and
smiled
sweetly
at
the
phoenix
you
get
used
to
it
in
no
time
admiral
when
they
landed
however
the
phoenix
recovered
rapidly
and
even
began
to
put
on
a
slight
nautical
swagger
the
sea
monster
humped
off
down
the
beach
followed
eagerly
by
the
two
treasure
hunters
in
a
few
minutes
it
came
to
a
halt
and
sniffed
the
sand
very
carefully
swinging
its
head
snakelike
to
and
fro
it
settled
on
one
spot
sniffed
it
thoroughly
felt
the
sand
with
its
whiskers
and
then
solemnly
announced
here
ahoy
me
hearties
the
phoenix
shouted
turn
to
and
stand
by
to
splice
the
main
brace
steady
as
she
goes
mates
david
needed
no
encouragement
from
anyone
he
began
to
dig
furiously
flashing
in
the
sun
the
spade
bit
into
the
beach
and
coarse
white
sand
spurted
in
all
directions
the
phoenix
was
quite
as
excited
as
david
it
danced
around
the
deepening
hole
with
eyes
asparkle
shouting
such
piratical
terms
as
shiver
me
timbers
strike
your
colors
and
give
no
quarter
lads
suddenly
it
began
to
beat
time
with
its
wing
and
to
sing
in
a
raucous
voice
cut
the
king
throat
and
take
the
king
gold
heave
ho
bullies
for
panama
there
plenty
of
loot
for
the
lad
who
is
bold
heave
away
bullies
for
panama
you
flat
on
that
last
note
said
the
sea
monster
my
dear
monster
i
have
perfect
pitch
oh
yes
you
have
perfect
sea
legs
too
well
ah
how
are
you
coming
along
my
boy
any
signs
of
treasure
david
did
not
hear
in
fact
he
heard
nothing
from
the
first
crunch
of
the
spade
onward
his
education
was
now
richer
by
this
fact
once
you
start
out
after
treasure
you
can
think
of
nothing
else
until
it
is
found
the
sun
was
beating
hotly
on
him
little
rivulets
of
sweat
poured
down
his
face
and
arms
his
muscles
ached
blisters
were
beginning
to
form
on
his
hands
heedless
of
all
he
dug
on
he
had
settled
into
the
rhythm
of
it
now
and
nothing
could
distract
him
tell
you
what
a
good
thing
for
seasickness
said
the
sea
monster
slyly
you
take
a
pretending
not
to
hear
the
phoenix
stood
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
and
stared
into
the
sky
david
dug
tirelessly
suddenly
the
spade
grated
on
something
solid
and
they
all
jumped
david
shouted
here
it
is
and
shoveled
up
sand
frantically
the
phoenix
danced
around
the
hole
also
shouting
even
the
sea
monster
arched
its
neck
to
get
a
better
view
they
could
see
a
brass
ring
crusted
with
verdigris
fastened
to
a
piece
of
wood
the
sand
flew
now
they
could
see
studded
strips
of
metal
bound
to
the
wood
and
a
rusty
padlock
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
whole
chest
with
slanting
sides
and
a
curved
lid
and
tarnished
brass
hinges
was
uncovered
david
threw
the
spade
on
the
beach
seized
the
brass
handle
and
tugged
it
came
off
in
his
hand
illustration
here
let
me
said
the
sea
monster
david
got
out
of
the
hole
and
the
sea
monster
worked
one
flipper
carefully
under
the
chest
look
out
it
said
and
heaved
its
flipper
up
the
chest
shot
into
the
air
tumbled
down
end
over
end
and
split
wide
open
on
the
beach
david
gasped
a
dazzling
sparkling
heap
spilled
out
on
the
sand
there
were
heaps
of
gold
and
silver
coins
the
silver
black
with
tarnish
but
the
gold
still
bright
there
were
pearls
rubies
diamonds
beryls
emeralds
opals
sapphires
amethysts
and
bracelets
necklaces
pendants
sunbursts
brooches
rings
pins
combs
buckles
lockets
buttons
crucifixes
and
carved
pieces
of
jade
and
ivory
and
coral
and
jet
and
coronets
crowns
tiaras
arm
bands
and
jeweled
daggers
picture
frames
vases
silver
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
sugar
bowls
platters
goblets
for
an
hour
they
examined
the
treasure
david
fairly
wallowed
in
it
exclaiming
look
at
this
one
or
oh
how
beautiful
or
just
golly
the
phoenix
muttered
such
things
as
king
ransom
and
wealth
of
the
indies
the
sea
monster
was
not
interested
in
the
treasure
but
kept
glancing
nervously
out
to
sea
at
last
the
phoenix
said
well
my
boy
i
think
we
had
better
make
our
choice
three
or
four
coins
should
do
it
the
sea
monster
gave
a
relieved
sigh
let
get
the
rest
of
it
underground
right
away
you
have
no
idea
what
trouble
it
can
cause
the
choice
was
difficult
there
were
so
many
coins
all
of
them
with
queer
writing
and
heads
of
unknown
gods
and
kings
david
finally
picked
out
four
gold
pieces
and
tied
them
up
in
his
handkerchief
then
the
sea
monster
swept
the
rest
of
the
treasure
into
the
hole
they
all
pushed
sand
in
on
top
of
it
and
jumped
on
the
mound
till
it
was
level
with
the
rest
of
the
beach
the
phoenix
turned
to
the
sea
monster
and
said
solemnly
monster
old
fellow
i
knew
you
would
not
fail
us
you
stood
forth
in
our
hour
of
need
and
we
shall
not
forget
and
david
echoed
thank
you
monster
the
sea
monster
ducked
its
head
and
blushed
a
wave
of
fiery
red
started
at
its
nose
traveled
rapidly
back
over
its
ears
down
its
neck
along
the
body
and
fanned
out
to
the
tips
of
its
flippers
and
the
extreme
end
of
the
barb
in
its
tail
even
its
whiskers
turned
pink
well
uh
glad
to
help
uh
nothing
to
it
really
it
mumbled
then
it
turned
abruptly
galloped
down
to
the
sea
plunged
into
the
surf
and
was
gone
which
the
phoenix
plan
is
carried
out
and
there
are
more
alarums
and
excursions
in
the
illustration
now
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
when
they
got
back
to
the
ledge
that
afternoon
are
the
shops
still
open
i
think
they
open
till
six
said
david
shaking
the
sand
out
of
his
shoes
are
we
going
to
buy
something
precisely
my
boy
a
hardware
store
should
have
what
we
need
now
you
will
take
our
gold
and
purchase
the
following
and
the
phoenix
listed
the
things
it
wanted
and
told
david
which
to
bring
to
the
ledge
and
which
to
leave
below
and
a
hatchet
the
phoenix
concluded
we
have
one
at
home
already
said
david
now
listen
phoenix
you
tell
me
what
all
this
is
for
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
it
my
boy
the
feline
existence
was
terminated
as
a
direct
result
of
its
inquisitiveness
what
did
you
say
curiosity
killed
the
cat
explained
the
phoenix
oh
but
now
run
along
my
boy
a
very
important
thought
has
just
come
to
me
i
must
meditate
a
while
the
phoenix
glanced
at
the
thicket
and
hid
a
yawn
behind
one
wing
oh
all
said
david
i
see
you
in
the
morning
then
it
was
until
he
got
home
that
he
thought
of
something
he
spend
pirate
gold
pieces
or
even
show
them
to
anyone
without
being
asked
a
lot
of
embarrassing
questions
what
to
do
ask
dad
or
mother
or
aunt
amy
to
lend
him
some
money
more
embarrassing
questions
well
he
would
have
to
rob
his
bank
but
wait
why
had
he
remembered
just
before
they
had
moved
uncle
charles
had
given
him
a
bill
as
a
farewell
present
he
had
been
saving
it
for
a
model
airplane
but
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
days
had
driven
it
completely
out
of
his
mind
of
course
the
phoenix
plan
was
more
important
than
any
model
plane
could
be
so
he
kept
the
gold
pieces
tied
up
in
his
handkerchief
and
took
his
ten
dollars
to
a
hardware
store
where
he
bought
what
the
phoenix
wanted
a
coil
of
rope
an
electric
door
bell
a
pushbutton
and
one
hundred
feet
of
insulated
wire
then
he
brought
the
package
home
hid
it
behind
the
woodpile
in
the
garage
and
sat
down
to
think
wire
bell
pushbutton
what
could
the
phoenix
possibly
want
with
them
and
what
was
the
rope
for
and
the
hatchet
the
more
he
puzzled
over
it
the
more
confused
he
became
and
finally
he
just
gave
up
there
was
only
one
thing
he
was
sure
about
whatever
the
plan
was
they
would
have
to
carry
it
out
as
soon
as
possible
two
days
had
passed
since
the
scientist
had
shown
up
the
new
gun
he
had
ordered
might
arrive
at
any
time
now
perhaps
even
today
when
they
had
been
digging
up
the
pirate
treasure
the
scientist
had
got
his
new
rifle
and
had
started
to
hunt
through
the
mountains
the
thought
gave
david
a
creepy
feeling
on
the
back
of
his
neck
they
certainly
would
have
to
hurry
early
next
morning
david
climbed
up
to
the
ledge
bringing
with
him
the
coil
of
rope
and
the
hatchet
as
an
afterthought
he
had
added
a
paper
bag
full
of
cookies
here
the
stuff
phoenix
he
called
out
as
he
stepped
onto
the
ledge
where
are
you
there
was
a
crash
from
the
thicket
as
though
someone
had
jumped
up
in
it
suddenly
and
the
phoenix
stumbled
out
rubbing
its
eyes
ah
splendid
my
boy
yes
i
was
just
ah
thinking
phoenix
said
david
i
not
going
to
ask
you
again
what
your
plan
is
because
i
know
you
tell
me
when
it
time
but
whatever
it
is
we
better
do
it
right
now
the
scientist
may
show
up
any
minute
precisely
my
boy
never
put
off
until
tomorrow
what
can
be
done
today
one
of
my
favorite
proverbs
we
shall
begin
immediately
here
the
phoenix
caught
sight
of
the
bag
in
david
hand
and
added
hastily
but
of
course
we
must
not
forget
that
first
things
come
first
you
might
have
brought
more
said
the
phoenix
fifteen
minutes
later
there
were
any
more
in
the
jar
david
said
phoenix
please
tell
me
what
we
going
to
do
i
do
care
if
curiosity
kill
the
cat
i
been
thinking
about
the
rope
and
wire
and
bell
all
night
and
i
ca
make
heads
or
tails
out
of
it
the
phoenix
gave
a
pleased
laugh
of
course
you
can
not
my
boy
the
plan
is
far
too
profound
for
you
to
guess
what
it
is
but
set
your
mind
at
rest
i
shall
now
explain
the
rope
and
hatchet
david
leaned
forward
eagerly
now
scientists
you
know
have
fixed
habits
if
you
know
those
habits
you
can
predict
just
what
they
will
do
at
any
time
our
particular
scientist
is
a
daytime
creature
that
is
to
say
he
comes
at
dawn
and
goes
at
dusk
his
invariable
habit
my
boy
well
there
you
are
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
triumphantly
shall
sleep
during
the
day
and
continue
your
education
at
night
oh
said
david
he
thought
about
this
a
while
then
asked
but
suppose
the
scientist
comes
up
on
the
ledge
during
the
day
and
catches
you
asleep
aha
that
is
where
the
rope
and
hatchet
come
in
never
fear
my
boy
i
thought
of
that
also
we
are
going
to
construct
a
snare
at
each
end
of
the
ledge
how
hand
me
that
twig
my
boy
the
phoenix
took
the
twig
found
a
bare
spot
of
earth
and
sketched
a
picture
first
we
find
a
sapling
and
clear
the
branches
from
it
with
the
hatchet
like
this
next
we
get
a
stake
cut
a
notch
in
it
and
drive
it
into
the
ground
so
the
sapling
is
bent
down
to
it
and
fitted
into
the
notch
which
holds
it
down
you
see
my
boy
now
we
make
a
noose
so
from
a
piece
of
rope
tie
it
to
the
end
of
the
sapling
and
spread
the
loop
out
on
the
path
this
way
the
whole
snare
is
hidden
under
grass
and
leaves
the
phoenix
beamed
and
flung
out
its
wings
in
a
dramatic
gesture
just
picture
it
my
dear
chap
the
scientist
smiling
evilly
as
he
skulks
along
the
path
the
unwary
footstep
the
sapling
jarred
out
of
the
notch
springing
upward
the
tightened
noose
and
our
archenemy
dangling
by
the
foot
in
completely
at
our
mercy
magnificent
golly
phoenix
said
david
that
pretty
clever
my
boy
better
to
say
stroke
of
genius
only
i
phoenix
could
have
thought
of
it
and
consider
the
poetic
justice
of
it
this
is
exactly
the
sort
of
trap
that
the
scientist
once
set
for
me
well
shall
we
begin
illustration
the
phoenix
had
made
the
snares
sound
delightfully
simple
but
they
soon
discovered
that
the
job
was
harder
than
it
sounded
first
they
had
to
find
the
right
kind
of
sapling
springy
and
strong
the
sapling
had
to
be
in
the
right
place
one
by
the
goat
trail
the
other
at
the
far
end
of
the
ledge
when
they
had
been
chosen
david
had
to
shinny
up
them
to
lop
off
their
branches
that
was
a
very
awkward
business
the
saplings
swayed
and
trembled
under
his
weight
and
he
could
only
use
one
hand
for
the
hatchet
then
he
had
to
make
two
stakes
from
stout
hard
wood
cut
a
notch
at
one
end
and
drive
them
into
the
ground
with
the
flat
of
the
hatchet
but
the
hardest
part
was
trying
to
bend
the
sapling
down
to
the
stake
and
fitting
it
into
the
notch
it
took
the
weight
of
both
of
them
to
bring
the
sapling
to
the
ground
if
they
got
the
slightest
bit
off
balance
it
would
spring
up
again
once
david
fell
off
the
sapling
went
back
into
the
air
flinging
the
astonished
phoenix
thirty
feet
up
the
mountainside
it
was
not
until
afternoon
when
the
sun
had
turned
ruddy
and
shadows
were
beginning
to
stretch
dark
fingers
across
the
land
that
they
finished
the
job
but
at
last
the
saplings
were
set
in
the
notches
the
nooses
were
formed
and
fastened
on
grass
and
leaves
were
strewn
over
the
snares
chips
hewn
branches
and
other
evidences
of
their
work
were
removed
they
sat
down
and
looked
proudly
at
each
other
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
i
have
had
a
wide
and
sometimes
painful
experience
with
traps
so
you
may
believe
me
when
i
say
that
these
are
among
the
best
i
have
seen
we
have
done
well
they
sure
strong
enough
david
agreed
flexing
his
fingers
to
take
the
stiffness
out
of
them
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
if
the
scientist
does
get
caught
in
one
we
shall
burn
that
bridge
when
we
reach
it
my
boy
now
do
you
have
the
pliers
and
screw
driver
below
yes
they
down
in
the
cellar
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them
phoenix
patience
patience
you
will
be
told
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
meet
you
tonight
after
dark
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
for
me
to
come
down
i
trust
you
will
have
everything
ready
are
you
coming
precisely
my
boy
a
risk
i
admit
but
a
necessary
one
there
is
a
hedge
at
the
back
of
your
house
is
there
not
splendid
you
may
await
me
there
david
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
jumped
when
he
heard
the
phoenix
quiet
good
evening
my
boy
phoenix
he
whispered
how
did
you
do
it
golly
i
did
see
you
at
all
and
it
is
even
dark
yet
i
have
been
hunted
long
enough
my
boy
to
have
learned
a
few
tricks
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
gliding
close
to
the
ground
selecting
the
best
shadows
and
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
well
let
us
get
on
with
the
plan
have
you
the
tools
here
yes
here
they
are
splendid
now
my
boy
since
we
must
continue
your
education
during
the
night
it
is
necessary
that
we
have
some
way
of
getting
in
touch
with
each
other
if
you
climb
the
mountainside
in
the
dark
you
may
unwittingly
fall
into
our
own
snare
it
is
far
easier
for
me
to
come
down
than
it
is
for
you
to
go
up
and
under
cover
of
darkness
i
can
do
it
quite
safely
the
question
now
is
how
will
you
know
when
i
have
arrived
that
my
boy
is
the
nub
or
crux
of
the
situation
a
difficult
problem
you
will
admit
but
i
have
worked
out
the
solution
the
phoenix
lowered
its
voice
impressively
my
boy
we
are
going
to
install
this
bell
in
your
room
and
the
pushbutton
on
the
base
of
that
telephone
pole
when
i
arrive
here
at
night
i
shall
press
the
button
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
ready
to
go
a
magnificent
idea
is
it
it
did
not
seem
very
practical
to
david
well
phoenix
that
a
good
idea
he
said
carefully
but
how
are
we
going
to
hide
the
wires
and
what
about
the
noise
of
the
bell
nothing
to
it
my
boy
the
wires
there
are
wires
between
your
house
and
the
telephone
pole
already
one
more
would
not
be
noticed
the
noise
you
have
a
pillow
on
your
bed
under
which
the
bell
can
be
muffled
yes
that
true
it
still
sounded
impractical
just
imagine
it
the
phoenix
continued
enthusiastically
perhaps
later
we
can
install
another
bell
at
this
end
then
we
could
learn
morse
code
and
send
messages
to
each
other
exactly
like
a
private
telephone
line
put
in
this
way
the
idea
had
a
certain
appeal
and
david
found
himself
warming
to
it
but
there
was
another
thing
to
consider
how
about
electricity
phoenix
look
above
you
my
boy
the
telephone
pole
is
simply
loaded
down
with
power
lines
waiting
to
be
tapped
the
phoenix
was
evidently
set
on
carrying
out
the
plan
and
david
did
not
want
to
wear
out
the
bird
patience
with
more
objections
and
well
why
not
there
should
be
no
harm
in
trying
it
out
anyway
they
gathered
up
the
tools
and
walked
along
the
hedge
to
the
telephone
pole
which
was
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
the
phoenix
began
to
uncoil
the
wire
while
david
gazed
up
doubtfully
at
the
shadowy
maze
of
lines
and
insulators
on
the
electricity
said
the
phoenix
thoughtfully
is
a
complicated
and
profound
subject
there
are
amperes
and
there
are
volts
and
there
are
kilowatt
hours
i
might
also
mention
positive
and
negative
and
ah
all
that
sort
of
thing
most
profound
perhaps
i
had
better
investigate
up
there
screw
driver
please
the
phoenix
took
the
screw
driver
in
one
claw
and
flew
up
to
the
top
of
the
pole
david
could
hear
the
creak
of
the
lines
under
the
phoenix
weight
and
the
rattling
of
the
screw
driver
against
the
porcelain
insulators
for
some
minutes
the
phoenix
investigated
clicking
and
scraping
about
and
muttering
quite
so
and
we
are
then
it
fluttered
down
again
and
rubbed
its
wings
together
the
whole
situation
up
there
is
a
lot
simpler
than
i
thought
it
would
be
my
boy
the
power
lines
merely
come
up
to
the
pole
on
one
side
pass
through
the
insulators
and
go
away
from
the
pole
on
the
other
side
child
play
the
covering
on
the
lines
is
rather
tough
however
we
shall
have
to
use
the
the
phoenix
returned
to
the
top
of
the
pole
with
the
cutters
and
worked
on
the
wires
for
five
more
minutes
bits
of
debris
began
to
shower
down
on
the
hedge
one
of
the
wires
vibrated
on
a
low
note
like
a
slack
guitar
string
we
must
not
forget
the
difference
between
alternating
and
direct
current
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
as
it
flew
down
again
an
important
problem
that
where
is
our
wire
ah
there
we
are
the
pliers
please
do
you
need
any
help
up
there
david
asked
no
everything
is
coming
along
beautifully
thank
you
i
shall
have
everything
finished
in
a
flash
trailing
one
end
of
the
wire
in
its
beak
the
phoenix
flew
up
into
the
darkness
once
more
the
tinkering
sounds
began
again
and
a
spurt
of
falling
debris
rattled
in
the
leaves
of
the
hedge
suddenly
it
happened
there
was
a
terrific
burst
of
blue
light
a
sharp
squawk
from
the
phoenix
and
a
shower
of
sparks
another
blue
flash
blazed
up
the
lights
in
the
house
and
down
the
whole
street
flickered
and
went
out
in
the
blackness
which
followed
each
stage
of
the
phoenix
descent
could
be
heard
as
clearly
as
cannon
shots
the
twanging
and
snapping
as
it
tumbled
through
the
wires
a
squawk
and
the
flop
of
wings
in
the
air
below
the
crash
into
the
hedge
the
jarring
thud
against
the
ground
broken
wires
began
to
sputter
ominously
and
fire
out
sparks
a
smell
of
singed
feathers
and
burning
rubber
filled
the
air
illustration
by
the
light
of
the
sparks
david
saw
the
phoenix
staggering
to
its
feet
he
jumped
to
the
bird
side
but
the
phoenix
waved
him
away
with
its
wing
quick
my
boy
it
gasped
we
must
make
a
strategic
retreat
meet
me
on
the
ledge
in
the
morning
ouch
the
phoenix
beat
at
the
smoldering
sparks
in
its
tail
and
flew
off
leaving
a
trail
of
acrid
smoke
hanging
in
the
air
david
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
gather
up
all
the
tools
the
wire
bell
and
pushbutton
and
one
of
the
phoenix
feathers
which
had
been
torn
out
during
the
fall
he
slipped
through
a
cellar
window
hid
the
equipment
under
a
stack
of
old
boxes
and
ran
noisily
up
the
stairs
into
the
kitchen
hey
he
shouted
the
lights
are
out
is
that
you
dear
came
mother
anxious
voice
from
the
dining
room
the
telephone
dead
dad
shouted
from
the
hall
aunt
amy
came
bumping
down
the
stairs
with
a
candle
it
that
burglar
she
cried
turning
out
all
the
lights
so
he
can
murder
us
in
our
beds
look
david
shouted
the
line
broken
in
our
back
yard
they
could
hear
the
wailing
of
sirens
now
fire
trucks
repair
trucks
and
police
cars
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
house
everyone
in
the
block
turned
out
to
see
what
had
happened
it
took
the
repair
men
an
hour
to
untangle
the
wires
and
fix
them
and
all
the
time
policemen
were
going
through
the
crowd
asking
questions
and
writing
things
down
in
their
notebooks
they
were
looking
rather
haggard
david
thought
which
david
and
the
phoenix
visit
a
banshee
and
a
surprise
is
planted
in
the
enemy
illustration
next
day
mother
asked
david
to
help
her
straighten
out
the
garden
which
had
been
trampled
by
the
repair
men
so
he
could
not
go
to
see
the
phoenix
until
after
lunch
but
when
that
was
finished
he
rushed
up
the
mountainside
as
fast
as
he
could
wondering
all
the
way
what
he
and
the
phoenix
were
going
to
do
now
the
ledge
was
empty
when
he
got
there
he
shouted
phoenix
and
listened
came
a
faint
answering
cry
from
the
other
end
of
the
ledge
david
jumped
through
the
thicket
a
pitiful
sight
met
his
eyes
there
was
the
phoenix
dangling
by
one
foot
from
the
snare
its
wings
feebly
struggling
and
its
free
foot
clawing
the
air
the
feathers
of
its
wings
and
tail
were
singed
great
beads
of
sweat
rolled
from
its
forehead
into
a
puddle
on
the
ground
below
the
snared
foot
was
blue
and
swollen
get
me
down
gasped
the
phoenix
weakly
david
took
a
running
leap
at
the
sapling
which
broke
under
the
sudden
increase
of
weight
and
the
two
of
them
crashed
to
the
ground
he
unfastened
the
noose
and
dragged
the
phoenix
to
the
shadiest
softest
spot
on
the
ledge
hoist
with
my
own
petard
said
the
phoenix
bitterly
rub
my
foot
will
you
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
hurts
what
happened
david
asked
as
he
rubbed
the
swollen
foot
how
long
have
you
been
caught
missed
my
way
in
the
dark
said
the
phoenix
wiping
its
brow
thought
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledge
and
landed
right
on
that
fool
trap
hung
there
all
night
and
all
morning
thought
you
would
never
come
my
boy
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
a
horrible
experience
my
tail
was
still
on
fire
when
i
landed
too
i
fully
expected
to
be
burned
to
a
crisp
a
large
tear
rolled
down
the
phoenix
beak
david
murmured
soothing
words
and
continued
to
chafe
the
foot
does
it
feel
any
better
now
the
feeling
is
coming
back
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
gritting
its
beak
ouch
all
pins
and
needles
it
flexed
its
toes
gingerly
rub
a
bit
more
please
gently
the
swelling
began
to
go
down
with
a
handful
of
damp
grass
david
soothed
the
marks
left
by
the
noose
that
stupid
electric
company
the
phoenix
suddenly
burst
out
putting
everyone
in
danger
with
a
power
line
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
boy
anything
worth
doing
is
worth
doing
well
they
will
hear
from
us
believe
me
we
shall
write
them
a
stiff
complaint
well
phoenix
said
david
hopefully
we
can
set
the
snare
again
if
we
can
find
another
good
sapling
and
we
still
have
the
other
one
so
we
pretty
well
protected
and
why
could
we
meet
every
night
by
the
hedge
the
way
we
did
last
night
the
bell
was
a
good
idea
but
we
get
along
without
it
the
phoenix
sighed
i
suppose
you
are
right
my
boy
there
is
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
one
must
set
one
jaw
and
good
heavens
my
boy
the
phoenix
threw
itself
to
the
ground
and
wildly
motioned
to
david
to
do
the
same
he
flattened
himself
out
beside
the
bird
and
said
what
is
it
phoenix
down
the
mountainside
whispered
the
phoenix
look
do
not
stick
your
head
over
too
far
david
wormed
his
way
to
the
edge
peered
down
and
gasped
below
him
on
the
grassy
slope
at
the
foot
of
the
scarp
was
a
figure
clad
in
khaki
it
was
the
scientist
do
you
think
he
saw
us
the
phoenix
whispered
i
do
think
so
david
whispered
back
he
looking
off
to
the
left
oh
phoenix
what
if
he
comes
up
here
what
we
do
listen
hissed
the
phoenix
run
down
there
talk
to
him
lead
him
away
distract
his
attention
anything
only
be
quick
all
right
the
phoenix
melted
into
the
thicket
and
david
jumped
to
his
feet
as
he
dashed
down
the
trail
his
brain
whirled
with
questions
what
should
he
do
what
could
he
say
how
could
he
lead
the
scientist
away
where
would
the
phoenix
go
in
his
haste
he
forgot
one
important
thing
his
foot
tripped
over
the
pile
of
grass
and
leaves
on
the
trail
the
released
sapling
sprang
upward
the
noose
tightened
with
a
cruel
jerk
around
his
ankle
and
he
was
snatched
into
the
air
as
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
he
lost
control
of
himself
and
began
to
struggle
wildly
and
shout
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
flat
dry
voice
of
the
scientist
drifted
to
him
as
if
through
a
long
tunnel
what
all
this
what
are
you
doing
here
who
set
this
snare
get
me
down
david
choked
please
a
hand
seized
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
a
knife
flashed
through
the
air
and
cut
the
rope
david
landed
on
his
feet
but
his
legs
gave
way
and
he
dropped
to
his
knees
he
felt
dizzy
as
the
blood
rushed
away
from
his
head
again
the
scientist
tilted
his
sun
helmet
back
and
said
well
well
david
in
a
disagreeable
tone
his
eyes
narrowed
behind
the
spectacles
what
is
this
snare
doing
here
david
struggled
to
his
feet
and
clutched
a
bush
for
support
thank
you
for
cutting
me
down
he
said
the
cold
blue
eyes
found
david
and
held
them
in
a
hypnotic
stare
what
is
this
trap
doing
here
who
set
it
i
i
was
coming
down
the
trail
and
and
i
was
caught
in
it
david
stammered
you
are
avoiding
my
question
young
man
said
the
scientist
who
set
this
snare
answer
me
there
was
a
brilliant
flash
of
gold
and
blue
in
the
sunlight
the
whistle
of
feathers
cleaving
the
air
the
sharp
of
fisted
talons
striking
the
scientist
pitched
forward
with
a
surprised
grunt
and
lay
still
across
the
trail
and
the
phoenix
executing
a
flip
in
the
air
to
check
its
speed
settled
down
beside
david
view
halloo
it
shouted
excitedly
yoicks
and
tallyho
did
you
see
that
stoop
my
boy
by
jove
the
falcon
could
not
have
done
better
believe
me
i
have
been
saving
that
blow
for
a
long
time
by
jove
what
a
magnificent
stoop
i
think
i
shall
take
up
as
a
regular
thing
thank
goodness
phoenix
david
exclaimed
another
minute
and
you
would
been
too
late
but
i
hope
you
have
hurt
him
very
much
nonsense
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
a
head
so
stuffed
with
scientific
fact
can
not
be
injured
he
will
come
to
in
a
short
while
the
phoenix
lifted
the
scientist
sun
helmet
and
examined
the
back
of
his
head
a
large
lump
is
developing
my
boy
a
most
pleasant
sight
i
fear
the
sun
helmet
is
now
useless
crushed
like
an
eggshell
and
the
phoenix
smiled
proudly
illustration
well
i
hope
it
is
serious
david
said
doubtfully
anyway
have
to
do
something
precisely
my
boy
but
i
think
we
should
have
a
drink
first
the
phoenix
detached
a
canteen
from
the
scientist
belt
and
took
a
deep
swig
ah
delicious
our
friend
is
well
prepared
my
boy
and
indeed
the
scientist
had
all
sorts
of
things
with
him
a
a
sheath
knife
a
compass
a
camera
binoculars
a
stop
watch
notebooks
and
pencils
a
coil
of
rope
maps
there
was
also
a
packet
of
sandwiches
which
the
phoenix
opened
and
began
to
eat
now
listen
phoenix
we
have
to
do
something
quite
right
my
boy
the
phoenix
mumbled
with
its
mouth
full
have
a
sandwich
spoils
of
war
peanut
butter
very
nourishing
the
fact
is
that
i
have
just
thought
of
another
plan
which
can
not
fail
have
we
any
money
left
yes
four
gold
pieces
why
splendid
now
my
boy
i
shall
leave
you
when
the
scientist
wakes
up
you
will
help
him
down
to
wherever
he
lives
find
out
where
his
room
is
i
shall
meet
you
by
the
hedge
at
midnight
be
sure
you
have
the
gold
pieces
with
you
all
right
what
are
we
sure
you
will
not
have
a
sandwich
no
thank
you
what
are
we
very
well
farewell
then
my
boy
till
midnight
david
poured
what
was
left
in
the
canteen
over
the
scientist
head
and
fanned
him
with
a
notebook
presently
the
man
stirred
and
groaned
then
he
sat
up
and
muttered
what
hit
me
can
you
stand
up
yet
david
said
too
dazed
to
ask
any
more
questions
the
scientist
got
up
groaning
put
on
his
broken
spectacles
collected
his
scattered
equipment
and
leaned
on
david
the
two
of
them
proceeded
slowly
down
the
trail
together
frequently
sitting
down
to
rest
the
scientist
murmured
the
name
of
his
hotel
and
pointed
out
the
direction
townspeople
stared
at
them
as
they
passed
but
no
one
stopped
them
or
asked
questions
and
they
reached
the
hotel
without
further
incident
they
entered
the
lobby
and
the
scientist
sank
into
a
chair
let
me
help
you
to
your
room
said
david
in
a
few
minutes
the
scientist
got
up
again
and
they
took
the
elevator
to
the
fourth
floor
david
closely
watched
the
direction
they
were
going
and
when
they
came
into
the
scientist
room
he
looked
quickly
through
the
window
there
was
a
fire
escape
just
outside
he
had
the
information
now
fourth
floor
west
side
fire
escape
by
window
the
scientist
eased
himself
onto
the
bed
with
a
groan
then
he
turned
to
david
and
said
severely
there
something
strange
about
all
this
and
i
intend
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
you
be
hearing
from
me
young
man
all
right
said
david
closing
the
door
and
you
be
hearing
from
he
added
in
an
undertone
if
i
know
the
phoenix
flying
at
night
was
colder
than
flying
by
day
but
it
was
more
thrilling
too
they
whistled
through
an
immense
blackness
stars
glittered
overhead
and
quicksilver
patches
of
moonlight
and
shadow
flashed
across
the
clouds
below
they
were
going
to
ireland
but
why
david
did
not
know
the
phoenix
was
playing
its
game
again
in
an
hour
or
so
they
shot
out
over
the
edge
of
the
cloud
mass
and
david
could
see
a
rocky
coast
below
dark
and
cold
in
the
the
phoenix
began
to
slant
down
toward
it
and
presently
they
landed
in
a
little
meadow
one
side
of
the
meadow
ran
down
to
a
bog
filled
with
reeds
and
on
the
other
side
was
a
gloomy
wood
everything
was
dark
and
indistinct
but
david
thought
he
could
tell
why
the
phoenix
had
called
this
the
emerald
isle
the
grass
beneath
their
feet
was
the
thickest
he
had
ever
felt
he
touched
a
boulder
and
found
it
furry
with
moss
with
the
wood
and
the
bog
the
whole
place
would
be
rich
with
various
greens
in
the
daylight
just
then
they
saw
a
little
man
approaching
them
from
the
wood
he
was
three
feet
tall
dressed
all
in
green
and
had
a
long
white
beard
when
he
reached
them
he
raised
his
cap
politely
and
said
good
evenin
to
you
a
fine
evening
to
you
my
good
leprechaun
said
the
phoenix
could
you
kindly
tell
us
will
you
have
a
cigar
the
leprechaun
interrupted
with
a
surprised
thank
you
very
much
the
phoenix
took
the
cigar
bit
off
the
end
and
popped
it
into
its
beak
the
leprechaun
lighted
it
and
the
phoenix
puffed
away
stick
o
gum
lad
said
the
leprechaun
to
david
holding
out
a
pack
why
yes
thank
you
said
david
he
took
the
stick
of
gum
from
the
pack
and
was
immediately
sorry
for
it
the
stick
was
made
of
wood
and
had
a
small
wire
spring
like
a
mouse
trap
which
snapped
down
on
his
finger
and
made
him
yelp
with
pain
at
the
same
instant
the
cigar
exploded
knocking
the
startled
bird
backwards
into
a
bush
haw
haw
haw
shouted
the
leprechaun
rolling
on
the
ground
and
holding
his
sides
haw
haw
haw
in
a
trice
the
phoenix
had
pounced
on
the
leprechaun
and
pinned
him
to
the
ground
let
him
up
said
david
furiously
i
punch
his
head
for
him
i
think
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
coldly
that
i
shall
carry
the
creature
up
into
the
clouds
and
drop
him
or
should
we
take
him
back
with
us
and
hand
him
over
to
the
scientist
now
do
take
offense
your
honor
said
the
leprechaun
i
thought
you
look
at
it
as
kind
o
comic
exceedingly
comic
said
the
phoenix
severely
i
am
quite
overcome
with
mirth
and
merriment
but
perhaps
i
shall
let
you
off
lightly
if
you
tell
us
where
the
banshee
lives
the
the
banshee
of
mare
nest
wood
the
same
speak
a
new
light
of
respect
and
fear
came
into
the
leprechaun
eyes
she
a
terror
she
is
what
you
be
wanting
none
of
your
business
roared
the
phoenix
where
is
she
the
leprechaun
had
begun
to
tremble
follow
the
path
yonder
through
the
wood
until
you
reach
the
cave
your
honor
you
not
friends
hers
are
you
you
not
be
telling
on
me
i
real
sorry
for
those
jokes
your
honor
the
leprechaun
fright
was
so
genuine
now
that
the
phoenix
relented
and
let
him
go
the
little
creature
dashed
off
like
a
rabbit
into
the
bog
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
beware
the
leprechaun
bearing
gifts
but
i
wonder
why
the
thought
of
the
banshee
frightened
him
so
they
followed
the
path
until
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
cave
under
a
heap
of
rocks
the
phoenix
plunged
in
and
david
nervously
followed
the
cave
turned
out
to
be
a
long
passageway
which
led
after
several
turns
into
a
chamber
from
the
ceiling
of
this
rocky
vault
hung
an
electric
light
bulb
which
glared
feebly
through
drifts
of
smoke
all
around
the
walls
were
wooden
boxes
stacked
up
to
make
shelves
and
cupboards
these
were
filled
with
an
astonishing
array
of
objects
bottles
vials
alembics
retorts
test
tubes
decanters
cages
boxes
jars
pots
skulls
books
snake
skins
wands
waxen
images
pins
and
needles
locks
of
hair
crystal
balls
playing
cards
dice
forks
tails
of
animals
spices
bottles
of
ink
in
several
colors
clay
pipes
a
small
brass
scale
compasses
measuring
cups
a
piggy
bank
which
squealed
off
and
on
in
a
peevish
way
balls
of
string
and
ribbons
a
pile
of
magazines
called
warlock
a
broken
ukulele
little
heaps
of
powder
colored
stones
candle
ends
some
potted
cacti
and
an
enormous
cash
register
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
a
little
hideous
crone
in
a
mother
hubbard
crouched
over
a
saucepan
stirring
it
with
a
wooden
spoon
the
saucepan
was
resting
in
the
coals
of
an
open
fire
and
smoke
and
steam
together
spread
out
in
a
murky
fog
the
crone
peered
at
them
over
the
top
of
her
spectacles
and
cackled
come
in
come
in
dearies
i
be
with
you
as
soon
as
ever
i
finish
this
brew
the
phoenix
who
had
been
gazing
around
the
chamber
in
surprise
said
my
dear
banshee
since
when
have
you
taken
up
witchcraft
this
is
most
unexpected
ah
is
the
phoenix
exclaimed
the
hag
peering
at
them
again
well
fancy
that
now
och
you
may
well
ask
and
i
be
telling
you
is
a
poor
life
being
a
banshee
long
hours
and
not
so
much
as
sixpence
in
it
for
a
full
night
work
and
i
got
that
sick
of
it
so
i
changed
me
trade
you
never
make
a
go
of
it
they
told
me
at
your
age
they
says
once
you
got
your
station
in
life
they
says
no
changing
it
in
the
prime
of
me
life
i
am
says
i
i
not
be
changing
me
mind
for
all
your
cackling
says
i
if
certain
mouths
do
shut
up
says
i
cast
spells
that
make
certain
people
wish
they
were
dead
that
set
them
back
on
their
heels
you
may
be
sure
well
was
the
best
decision
of
me
life
the
money
pours
in
like
sorrows
to
a
widow
and
i
be
retiring
within
the
year
to
live
out
my
days
like
a
proper
queen
then
the
banshee
caught
sight
of
david
and
hobbled
over
to
him
peering
into
his
frightened
eyes
ah
the
wee
darling
she
crooned
the
plump
little
mannikin
what
a
broth
he
make
to
be
sure
she
pinched
his
arm
and
he
started
back
in
terror
so
firm
and
plump
to
make
the
mouth
water
sell
him
to
me
phoenix
nonsense
said
the
phoenix
sharply
what
we
desire
at
this
instant
the
contents
of
the
saucepan
began
to
hiss
and
bubble
whoops
dearies
the
brew
is
boiling
shrieked
the
banshee
and
she
hobbled
back
to
the
fire
to
resume
her
work
she
looked
in
a
recipe
book
stirred
clapped
her
hands
sang
incantations
in
a
quavery
voice
and
added
a
pinch
of
salt
and
sulfur
she
sprinkled
spices
from
a
shaker
waved
her
wand
popped
in
a
dead
toad
and
fanned
up
the
fire
with
an
ostrich
plume
illustration
now
for
the
hard
part
she
said
grinning
at
them
toothlessly
she
measured
out
a
spoonful
of
green
powder
weighed
it
in
the
scales
and
flung
it
into
the
saucepan
there
was
a
loud
explosion
a
huge
blast
of
steam
flared
out
and
engulfed
them
when
it
had
cleared
they
saw
the
banshee
tilting
the
saucepan
over
a
small
bottle
one
ruby
drop
of
fluid
fell
into
the
bottle
it
darted
forth
rays
of
light
as
it
fell
and
tinkled
like
a
silver
coin
rolling
down
flights
of
marble
steps
illustration
the
banshee
corked
the
bottle
and
held
it
up
proudly
to
the
light
will

look
at
that
now
she
crooned
the
finest
ever
i
brewed
ah
the
mystic
droplet
some
swain
will
be
buying
that
now
and
putting
it
in
a
lassie
cup
o
tea
and
she
be
pining
away
for
love
of
him
before
the
day
out
she
put
the
bottle
on
the
shelf
pasted
a
label
on
it
and
turned
to
them
with
a
businesslike
air

cried
the
hag
you
come
to
the
right
shop
dearies
to
be
sure
now
let
me
see
she
hobbled
to
a
shelf
which
contained
a
row
of
boxes
ran
her
finger
along
them
stopped
at
one
and
took
it
down
here
we
are
key
of
two
minutes
long
only
five
shillings
threepence
no

said
the
phoenix
a
larger
one
we
have
something
more
than
mice
to
frighten
a
bigger
one
och
here
a
lovely
one
now
five
minutes
long
ascending
scale
with
a
sob
at
the
end
guaranteed
to
scare
a
statue
yours
for
ten
and
six
i
call
that
a
real
bargain
now
bah
said
the
phoenix
impatiently
enough
of
these
squeaks
we
want
a
real
my
dear
banshee
such
a
wail
as
never
before
was
heard
on
the
face
of
this
earth
and
stop
this
babbling
about
shillings
and
pence
we
are
prepared
to
pay
in
gold
the
phoenix
took
the
four
pieces
of
gold
from
david
and
carelessly
tossed
them
into
the
air
the
banshee
eyes
flew
wide
open
and
she
twirled
herself
around
like
a
top
och
the
sweet
music
of
its
tinkling
she
exclaimed
the
lovely
sheen
of
light
upon
it
a
sight
for
eyes
used
to
naught
but
silver
ah
but
dearies
i
no
wail
worth
four
pieces
of
gold
i
have
to
make
one
up
special
she
hobbled
rapidly
around
the
chamber
until
she
had
found
a
box
as
large
as
a
bird
cage
and
an
ear
trumpet
she
opened
the
box
shook
it
to
make
sure
it
was
empty
and
put
in
two
heads
of
cabbage
such
monstrous
appetites
these
wails
do
have
she
explained
she
fastened
the
lid
carefully
with
a
and
inserted
the
ear
trumpet
in
a
hole
in
one
side
of
the
box
then
she
disappeared
through
a
door
which
they
had
not
seen
before
on
account
of
the
smoke
fifteen
minutes
later
the
banshee
came
out
with
the
box
plugging
up
the
hole
in
its
side
with
a
bit
of
wax
she
was
pale
and
trembling
and
beads
of
sweat
covered
her
face
she
smiled
weakly
at
them
seized
an
jug
and
drained
it
in
one
gulp
the
color
began
to
return
to
her
face
wsssht
she
gasped
wiping
her
brow
with
the
sleeve
of
her
mother
hubbard
ah
dearies
that
was
the
effort
of
me
life
is
a
wail
to
make
one
burst
with
pride
though
i
do
say
it
meself
thirteen
minutes
long
by
the
clock
with
a
range
of
ten
octaves
frighten
the
old
nick
himself
splendid
said
the
phoenix
the
fact
is
i
sometimes
suspect
that
that
is
precisely
with
whom
we
are
dealing
at
home
the
light
suddenly
dawned
on
david
phoenix
he
cried
i
bet
going
to
give
the
wail
to
the
scientist
precisely
my
boy
the
phoenix
beamed
oh
golly
golly
golly
david
sang
as
he
danced
around
and
i
guarantee
it
dearies
the
banshee
cackled
one
hundred
per
cent
satisfaction
or
your
money
back
defeat
and
confusion
to
the
enemy
the
phoenix
shouted
giving
the
special
squawk
which
was
its
battle
cry
the
banshee
received
her
gold
the
phoenix
told
david
for
goodness
sake
not
to
drop
the
box
or
let
the
lid
pop
open
or
they
would
regret
it
to
their
dying
day
david
hearing
the
rustle
of
the
wail
as
it
ravenously
attacked
the
cabbages
inside
the
box
assured
the
phoenix
that
he
would
be
careful
the
banshee
said
ah
phoenix
do
sell
the
laddie
to
me
but
her
tone
was
more
teasing
than
serious
and
they
all
laughed
were
said
all
round
and
david
and
the
phoenix
left
the
last
thing
they
heard
as
they
felt
their
way
up
the
dark
passage
was
the
happy
cackling
of
the
banshee
and
the
clang
of
the
cash
register
they
got
back
to
the
hotel
before
dawn
and
very
carefully
crept
down
the
fire
escape
into
the
scientist
room
they
put
the
box
on
the
bedside
table
stuck
out
their
tongues
at
the
sleeping
scientist
and
crept
out
again
then
they
went
home
the
phoenix
to
the
ledge
and
david
to
bed
where
he
fell
asleep
instantly
the
wail
was
wildly
successful
the
scientist
released
it
from
its
box
at
seven
in
the
morning
people
living
in
the
hotel
thought
the
world
had
come
to
its
end
the
rest
of
the
town
wondered
if
it
was
a
riot
or
an
earthquake
or
both
with
three
steam
calliopes
thrown
in
for
good
measure
david
who
lived
twelve
blocks
from
the
hotel
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
dreamed
he
was
riding
a
fire
engine
even
the
phoenix
claimed
later
that
a
kind
of
moan
was
borne
on
the
breeze
all
the
way
up
to
the
ledge
the
hotel
burst
into
activity
like
a
kicked
anthill
people
poured
down
the
fire
escapes
shot
out
through
the
doors
lowered
themselves
into
the
street
with
ropes
of
knotted
blankets
others
barricaded
themselves
in
their
rooms
by
piling
furniture
against
the
doors
and
windows
one
guest
found
his
way
to
the
cellar
and
hid
in
an
ash
can
for
two
days
the
manager
crawled
into
the
office
safe
and
locked
the
door
without
even
bothering
to
remember
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
combination
the
telephone
exchange
was
jammed
as
calls
flooded
in
to
mobilize
the
boy
scouts
the
red
cross
the
salvation
army
the
national
guard
and
the
volunteer
flood
control
association
when
the
wail
finally
died
out
which
was
not
until
because
it
had
devoured
both
cabbages
during
the
night
and
had
grown
to
more
than
twice
its
original
size
the
police
entered
the
hotel
in
force
armed
to
the
eyebrows
they
found
nothing
at
the
end
of
a
search
the
chief
handed
in
his
resignation
as
for
the
scientist
he
disappeared
completely
a
farmer
living
three
miles
out
of
town
said
he
saw
a
man
dressed
in
a
nightshirt
and
running
down
the
valley
road
the
farmer
guessed
the
man
speed
to
be
miles
an
hour
but
he
added
there
was
such
a
cloud
of
dust
being
raised
that
he
could
not
see
very
well
it
might
have
been
fifty
miles
an
hour
he
said
no
one
doubted
him
illustration
which
david
and
the
phoenix
call
on
a
faun
and
a
lovely
afternoon
comes
to
a
strange
illustration
the
phoenix
was
dead
tired
and
no
wonder
all
in
one
week
it
had
escaped
from
gryffons
raced
with
a
witch
made
flights
to
the
pacific
isles
and
ireland
been
caught
in
a
snare
got
burned
by
a
short
circuit
and
been
knocked
down
by
an
exploding
cigar
even
a
bird
as
strong
as
the
phoenix
can
not
do
all
these
things
without
needing
a
rest
so
the
traveling
part
of
david
education
was
stopped
for
a
while
to
let
the
phoenix
recover
the
days
went
by
pleasantly
on
the
ledge
summer
was
at
its
height
the
sun
fell
on
them
with
just
the
right
amount
of
warmth
as
they
lolled
on
the
grass
the
air
was
filled
with
a
lazy
murmuring
listen
the
murmuring
seemed
to
say
do
talk
do
think
close
your
eyes
and
listen
below
them
the
whole
valley
danced
and
wavered
in
the
heat
waves
so
that
it
seemed
to
be
under
water
there
were
long
lazy
conversations
that
began
nowhere
and
ended
nowhere
the
wonderful
kind
in
which
you
say
whatever
comes
to
your
head
without
fear
of
being
misunderstood
because
what
you
say
has
little
importance
anyway
the
phoenix
told
of
the
times
and
adventures
it
had
had
of
the
forgotten
corners
of
the
world
where
life
went
on
as
it
had
from
the
beginning
and
of
friends
who
lived
there
of
trolls
who
mined
metal
from
the
earth
and
made
from
it
wondrous
machines
which
whirred
and
clattered
and
clanked
and
did
absolutely
nothing
the
best
kind
of
machine
after
all
my
boy
since
they
injure
no
one
and
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
when
they
break
down
of
unicorns
excellent
chaps
but
so
frightfully
melancholy
which
shone
white
in
the
sun
and
tossed
their
ivory
horns
like
rapiers
of
a
dragon
who
having
no
treasure
to
guard
got
together
a
pathetic
heap
of
colored
pebbles
in
its
cave
and
really
he
came
to
believe
in
time
that
they
were
absolutely
priceless
and
went
about
with
a
worried
frown
of
responsibility
on
his
brow
david
in
turn
told
the
phoenix
about
the
games
he
used
to
play
when
he
lived
in
the
flat
country
and
all
about
school
and
mother
and
dad
and
aunt
amy
and
beckie
he
could
not
help
laughing
now
and
then
over
the
scientist
defeat
but
whenever
this
came
up
the
phoenix
would
shake
its
head
with
a
kind
of
sad
wisdom
my
boy
there
are
certain
things
such
as
head
colds
and
forgetting
where
you
have
left
your
keys
which
are
inevitable
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
scientist
is
too
oh
phoenix
you
do
think
he
come
back
do
you
yes
my
boy
i
do
i
can
see
the
whole
train
of
events
he
will
recover
from
his
fright
he
will
be
curious
about
the
wail
and
will
return
to
investigate
it
once
here
he
will
remember
us
and
we
shall
have
to
take
him
into
account
once
more
oh
do
you
think
it
happen
soon
oh
no
my
boy
nothing
to
worry
about
for
the
time
being
but
we
must
remember
that
it
will
happen
some
day
yes
i
guess
you
right
i
think
he
hateful
i
can
not
disagree
with
you
there
my
boy
of
course
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
general
the
advancement
of
science
is
all
to
the
good
knowledge
is
power
but
on
days
like
this
i
sometimes
wonder
does
it
not
seem
to
you
that
the
highest
aim
in
life
at
the
moment
is
to
enjoy
the
sunlight
and
allow
others
to
do
the
same
you
right
phoenix
but
then
you
always
are
i
was
just
thinking
the
same
thing
it
funny
i
mean
well
know
why
people
leave
other
people
alone
and
and
well
just
themselves
and
lie
in
the
sun
and
listen
to
the
wind
that
is
the
way
of
the
world
my
boy
getting
and
spending
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
come
why
should
we
worry
over
the
follies
of
the
rest
of
the
world
a
day
like
this
was
made
for
living
not
thinking
begone
dull
care
and
they
would
forget
the
scientist
and
watch
a
pair
of
butterflies
chase
each
other
instead
but
one
day
the
phoenix
suddenly
stood
up
with
a
startled
expression
on
its
face
my
dear
chap
it
exclaimed
i
have
just
remembered
tomorrow
what
about
tomorrow
why
my
boy
tomorrow
another
century
rounds
its
mark
to
be
brief
tomorrow
is
my
birthday
my
five
hundredth
birthday
well
congratulations
phoenix
thank
you
my
boy
five
hundred
destiny
have
i
mentioned
before
my
boy
that
i
have
a
magnificent
destiny
no
what
is
it
phoenix
i
well
it
is
strange
my
boy
but
i
do
not
know
but
that
it
is
magnificent
no
one
can
doubt
do
i
have
one
too
of
course
my
boy
we
all
do
david
was
glad
of
that
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
a
destiny
was
however
and
he
tried
to
think
of
how
one
would
look
but
the
only
picture
which
came
to
his
mind
was
that
of
a
small
mousy
creature
his
destiny
looking
up
in
admiration
to
a
splendid
thing
of
flame
and
gold
dazzling
to
the
eyes
the
phoenix
mysterious
destiny
he
said
we
have
to
do
something
special
tomorrow
to
celebrate
phoenix
the
phoenix
looked
thoughtful
i
think
we
had
better
do
whatever
we
are
going
to
do
it
said
well
we
can
do
something
today
tomorrow
then
said
david
after
all
a
birthday
only
comes
once
a
year
and
it
seems
a
shame
to
spend
only
one
day
on
it
especially
when
it
a
five
hundredth
birthday
tomorrow
said
the
phoenix
doubtfully
i
have
a
strange
feeling
my
boy
for
once
i
find
myself
unable
to
explain
most
odd
odd
five
hundredth
birthday
ah
well
it
went
on
more
cheerfully
i
shall
undoubtedly
remember
later
the
pressing
question
is
what
shall
we
do
now
david
got
up
thought
for
a
while
and
suddenly
flung
his
arms
wide
oh
phoenix
he
cried
it
such
a
beautiful
day
i
wish
it
could
go
on
forever
could
we
go
somewhere
somewhere
where
we
oh
i
do
know
i
ca
explain
it
anywhere
say
phoenix
the
phoenix
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
i
think
i
understand
my
boy
yes
how
about
one
of
the
forgotten
places
i
told
you
about
should
you
like
to
meet
a
faun
it
was
a
green
valley
completely
enclosed
by
the
barren
mountains
which
towered
above
it
at
one
end
a
waterfall
hung
on
the
face
of
a
cliff
a
misty
thread
pouring
into
a
pool
a
brook
serpentined
through
fields
and
groves
of
trees
there
were
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
in
the
fields
here
and
there
were
strange
ruins
of
marble
and
red
granite
columns
peristyles
benches
carved
with
lions
heads
and
pedestals
they
landed
in
a
little
glade
and
david
got
down
in
silent
wonderment
the
very
stillness
of
the
air
was
enchanted
the
grass
dappled
with
sun
and
shadow
wore
a
mantle
of
flowers
clouds
of
butterflies
sprang
up
at
their
approach
and
swirled
about
them
to
their
right
stood
two
broken
columns
beneath
a
wild
tangle
of
vine
and
clusters
of
purple
grapes
beyond
was
the
forest
dark
and
cool
and
silent
with
shafts
of
sunlight
in
it
like
golden
spears
pinning
the
forest
floor
to
earth
there
was
no
breeze
and
as
david
stood
there
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
they
heard
the
sound
of
shepherd
pipes
coming
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
it
was
a
minor
tune
but
somehow
lilting
too
with
the
rippling
of
water
in
it
and
the
laughter
of
birds
flying
high
and
the
whisper
of
reeds
as
they
bend
together
by
the
edge
of
streams
and
the
gaiety
of
crickets
by
night
and
the
pouring
of
summer
rain
the
piping
died
away
and
the
phoenix
beckoned
to
the
spellbound
david
together
they
walked
across
the
glade
leaving
behind
them
a
wake
of
swirling
butterflies
an
immense
oak
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
at
its
foot
on
a
bed
of
moss
sat
the
faun
he
was
the
same
size
as
david
from
the
waist
down
he
was
covered
with
shaggy
hair
like
a
goat
and
instead
of
feet
he
had
cloven
hooves
the
hair
on
his
head
was
black
and
curly
and
tumbled
around
small
pointed
ears
and
a
pair
of
short
horns
his
eyes
were
slanted
slightly
upward
and
he
had
a
pointed
chin
and
a
snub
nose
the
faun
waved
his
pipes
saucily
at
the
phoenix
and
gave
a
wry
smile
hullo
phoenix
back
again
to
honor
us
with
your
wit
and
wisdom
what
gems
of
advice
have
you
got
for
us
now
my
dear
faun
said
the
phoenix
stiffly
i
have
brought
my
friend
david
who
is
acquiring
an
education
we
the
faun
smiled
at
david
want
to
race
he
said
sure
said
david
where
to
one
moment
harrumphed
the
phoenix
what
we
down
to
that
pedestal
and
back
said
the
faun
all
right
wait
till
i
tie
my
shoe
the
phoenix
harrumphed
again
this
is
all
very
well
in
its
place
but
we
ready
said
the
faun
one
two
three
illustration
they
dashed
for
the
stone
marker
it
was
an
even
race
until
they
reached
the
pedestal
but
there
david
tried
to
turn
without
slowing
down
slipped
on
the
grass
and
went
sprawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
the
faun
knew
better
he
sprang
at
the
pedestal
with
both
hooves
bounced
from
it
like
a
spring
and
began
to
race
back
to
the
oak
but
then
he
too
fell
tripping
over
a
vine
and
david
shot
past
him
and
touched
the
oak
one
jump
ahead
of
him
shouting
first
they
sat
down
on
the
moss
panting
the
faun
said
you
can
really
run
i
sorry
you
fell
well
you
fell
too
so
that
makes
us
even
said
david
they
looked
at
each
other
and
for
some
reason
burst
out
laughing
they
rolled
around
on
the
moss
and
laughed
until
tears
came
while
the
phoenix
fidgeted
in
reproachful
silence
when
they
had
calmed
down
a
little
the
faun
said
can
you
dance
no
said
david
i
wish
i
could
though
the
educational
value
of
dancing
is
practically
nil
the
phoenix
began
severely
i
advise
sure
you
can
dance
said
the
faun
listen
he
brought
the
pipes
to
his
lips
and
began
to
play
and
much
to
his
surprise
and
delight
david
found
himself
dancing
as
though
he
had
never
done
anything
else
in
his
life
the
wonderful
thing
was
that
he
did
not
have
to
think
about
what
he
was
doing
the
music
was
doing
it
all
for
him
he
saw
that
even
the
phoenix
was
shuffling
around
in
time
to
the
piping
and
looking
very
embarrassed
about
it
too
there
said
the
faun
when
they
had
finished
you
dance
and
very
well
even
old
phoenix
can
dance
suddenly
he
jumped
up
and
cried
let
go
come
on
and
started
to
run
david
followed
not
knowing
where
they
were
going
and
not
caring
the
phoenix
came
after
them
half
running
and
half
flying
to
keep
up
they
raced
across
the
glade
through
a
stand
of
trees
and
out
into
the
meadow
beyond
there
they
came
to
a
bank
of
daisies
and
threw
themselves
into
the
middle
of
it
and
began
to
pelt
each
other
with
blossoms
the
phoenix
finally
caught
up
in
the
spirit
of
it
collected
a
huge
bunch
while
they
were
wrestling
flew
suddenly
over
them
and
drowned
them
beneath
a
deluge
of
flowers
near
by
was
the
stream
they
splashed
in
the
shallows
skipped
pebbles
over
the
surface
and
dug
a
harbor
with
two
dikes
in
the
sandy
part
of
the
shore
the
faun
showed
david
how
to
build
little
boats
of
reeds
and
the
phoenix
made
them
sail
by
blowing
up
a
wind
with
its
wings
they
had
a
contest
which
david
won
because
his
feet
were
better
than
hooves
for
standing
on
branches
but
the
faun
won
the
jumping
contest
because
of
the
tremendous
spring
in
his
legs
they
came
out
even
in
the
handstand
somersault
and
contest
and
the
phoenix
won
when
they
played
with
a
piece
of
vine
because
it
could
hover
in
the
air
with
its
wings
while
the
vine
swished
over
and
under
they
had
fun
with
the
sheep
and
goats
too
the
faun
made
the
animals
dance
and
caper
to
a
tune
from
his
pipes
and
showed
david
how
to
ride
on
the
rams
you
crept
up
very
quietly
from
behind
jumped
suddenly
on
their
backs
got
a
quick
grip
around
their
necks
and
away
in
a
rush
it
was
almost
as
good
as
flying
except
that
you
got
jolted
off
sooner
or
later
then
watch
out
it
took
some
quick
dodging
to
escape
the
horns
of
the
angry
rams
they
left
the
goats
alone
because
of
their
sharper
horns
and
the
wicked
look
in
their
eyes
i
know
where
some
pictures
are
said
the
faun
come
on
and
he
led
them
to
a
kind
of
glade
ringed
with
shattered
columns
the
ground
there
was
covered
with
moss
and
drifts
of
leaves
they
each
got
a
stick
to
clear
away
the
debris
and
uncovered
a
beautiful
mosaic
pavement
it
was
made
of
bits
of
colored
stone
and
tile
which
were
arranged
to
make
pictures
there
were
scenes
of
youths
treading
out
wine
minstrels
with
lyres
gods
with
curly
hair
and
a
beast
which
was
half
man
and
half
horse
there
were
maidens
dancing
to
flute
and
drums
hunters
battling
with
boars
and
lions
warriors
clashing
with
sword
and
shield
and
spear
there
were
series
of
pictures
telling
stories
of
wonders
and
adventures
in
lands
voyages
wars
conquests
the
faun
proudly
pointed
out
a
picture
of
other
fauns
dancing
with
nymphs
the
phoenix
gazed
very
thoughtfully
at
some
scenes
of
a
bird
building
and
sitting
in
a
nest
of
flames
but
the
last
pictures
of
this
story
had
been
broken
up
by
roots
so
they
could
not
see
how
it
ended
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
valley
where
the
rainbow
arched
over
the
pool
david
told
them
of
the
pot
of
gold
which
is
supposed
to
be
at
the
foot
of
rainbows
they
looked
for
it
but
without
success
because
the
rainbow
disappeared
whenever
they
got
too
close
to
it
so
david
and
the
faun
contented
themselves
with
jumping
into
the
pool
and
ducking
each
other
and
making
bubbly
noises
while
the
phoenix
who
could
not
swim
stood
on
the
shore
and
beamed
at
them
they
picked
ferns
from
under
the
waterfall
and
made
wreaths
and
garlands
which
they
threw
at
the
phoenix
head
like
quoits
the
faun
showed
them
a
certain
place
to
shout
from
if
you
wanted
to
hear
an
echo
the
phoenix
shouted
a
stitch
in
time
saves
nine
and
the
echo
dolorously
answered
a
switch
is
fine
for
crime
wet
and
tired
from
splashing
in
the
pool
they
stretched
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
a
grapevine
grew
near
them
and
they
gorged
themselves
on
the
fruit
smearing
their
faces
and
hands
with
purple
and
david
closed
his
eyes
and
thought
now
i
having
a
dream
and
so
is
the
phoenix
we
all
dreaming
the
same
thing
and
living
in
the
dream
and
i
wish
oh
i
wish
none
of
us
will
ever
wake
up
but
he
had
just
opened
his
eyes
again
when
the
faun
leaped
to
his
feet
and
cried
listen
and
flicked
his
pointed
ears
forward
like
a
cat
david
stood
up
and
said
in
a
puzzled
voice
i
do
hear
anything
he
noticed
that
the
phoenix
had
also
got
up
and
was
listening
uncomfortably
to
whatever
it
was
listen
oh
listen
cried
the
faun
there
was
a
joyous
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
leaned
forward
with
his
lips
slightly
parted
straining
toward
the
mysterious
silence
suddenly
he
shouted
i
coming
coming
and
dashed
off
into
the
wood
good
heavens
muttered
the
phoenix
i
had
forgotten
about
this
let
us
go
home
my
boy
a
strange
uncontrollable
trembling
had
seized
david
legs
he
still
could
hear
nothing
but
some
feeling
some
hint
of
an
unknown
tremendous
event
hung
quivering
in
the
air
about
them
and
sent
little
electric
thrills
racing
up
and
down
his
whole
body
oh
phoenix
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
whispered
i
think
we
had
best
be
going
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
anxiously
come
along
phoenix
but
he
heard
it
now
it
came
whispering
toward
them
the
sound
of
pipes
caroling
pipes
such
as
the
faun
had
played
but
greater
as
an
organ
is
greater
than
a
flute
the
wild
sweet
sound
rose
and
fell
swelled
like
a
full
choir
diminished
into
one
soprano
voice
that
pierced
david
through
and
through
caressing
and
tugging
calling
come
come
run
run
phoenix
david
cried
oh
phoenix
listen
listen
run
run
the
pipes
whispered
let
us
go
home
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
warningly
come
come
cried
the
pipes
they
could
be
resisted
no
longer
in
a
transport
of
joy
david
shouted
coming
and
raced
away
toward
the
sound
there
was
nothing
in
his
mind
now
nothing
in
the
whole
world
but
a
desire
to
be
near
those
pipes
he
must
run
like
the
winds
leap
and
shout
roll
in
the
grass
throw
himself
down
flowered
slopes
follow
that
magic
music
wherever
it
should
lead
he
fled
blindly
through
the
wood
heedless
of
the
branches
which
whipped
his
face
and
the
thorns
which
tore
at
his
legs
the
pipes
were
calling
more
loudly
now
run
run
faster
faster
then
the
phoenix
plunged
to
earth
in
front
of
him
threw
out
both
wings
and
shouted
stop
let
me
go
phoenix
david
cried
let
me
by
i
want
to
run
i
must
run
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
push
past
the
outstretched
wings
but
the
phoenix
flung
him
to
the
ground
picked
him
up
before
he
could
kick
once
and
threw
him
on
its
back
then
they
were
flying
at
full
speed
dodging
through
gaps
in
the
branches
and
between
trunks
with
leaves
and
twigs
slashing
them
from
every
side
they
burst
out
of
the
wood
and
sped
over
a
meadow
david
saw
below
them
a
huge
figure
pacing
majestically
across
the
sward
a
flaming
wreath
encircled
its
brow
garlands
of
flowers
hung
from
its
arms
and
shoulders
and
those
enchanted
pipes
were
lifted
to
its
lips
around
the
cloven
hooves
and
trailing
out
behind
danced
a
multitude
of
creatures
lambs
and
kids
gamboling
goats
and
rams
tossing
their
horns
foxes
furry
waves
of
squirrels
rabbits
kicking
up
their
heels
fauns
and
nymphs
rollicking
frogs
and
crickets
and
serpents
above
them
flew
birds
and
butterflies
and
beetles
and
bats
in
swirling
clouds
the
glorious
pipes
sang
come
come
run
run
follow
leap
and
dance
adore
and
obey
run
oh
run
heed
me
before
all
passes
follow
before
it
is
too
late
too
late
too
late
illustration
and
david
in
a
delirium
of
desire
shouted
i
coming
and
jumped
from
the
phoenix
back
for
an
instant
as
he
fell
through
the
air
he
thought
he
would
succeed
in
joining
the
dancing
throng
but
the
phoenix
plunging
after
him
falconwise
with
folded
wings
seized
his
collar
in
its
talons
and
snatched
him
up
from
the
very
arms
of
the
faun
who
had
recognized
him
and
called
his
name
as
he
fell
up
toward
the
cloudless
sky
they
soared
david
cried
pleaded
pommeled
the
phoenix
with
his
fists
the
phoenix
ignored
his
struggling
and
continued
to
climb
with
tremendous
wing
strokes
up
and
up
and
up
the
piping
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
its
magic
weakened
the
enchanted
dancers
diminished
into
specks
the
valley
fell
away
until
it
was
only
a
green
splash
nestled
among
the
jagged
peaks
and
david
burst
into
tears
and
then
wondered
why
he
was
crying
and
tried
to
remember
and
could
not
the
trembling
left
his
body
and
he
dangled
limply
his
eyes
closed
which
a
five
hundredth
birthday
is
celebrated
and
the
phoenix
bows
to
illustration
that
funny
said
david
rubbing
his
eyes
and
looking
around
in
a
puzzled
way
where
are
we
phoenix
is
the
sailor
home
from
the
hill
the
phoenix
said
the
hunter
home
from
the
sea
or
is
it
the
other
way
around
at
any
rate
we
are
home
my
boy
and
so
they
were
were
we
playing
with
a
faun
just
now
quite
so
but
there
was
something
else
david
said
something
somebody
say
before
it
is
too
late
or
something
like
that
we
follow
i
ca
remember
no
my
boy
by
the
time
one
hears
that
it
is
already
too
late
oh
too
late
for
what
he
wondered
oh
well
he
sighed
and
fell
to
daydreaming
a
cough
from
the
phoenix
brought
him
back
beg
your
pardon
i
have
never
seen
you
so
thoughtful
my
boy
however
i
believe
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
it
a
difficult
problem
is
it
not
yes
i
was
just
thinking
what
you
could
get
me
for
a
birthday
present
interrupted
the
phoenix
am
i
not
correct
david
who
had
not
even
given
this
a
thought
until
now
flushed
aha
said
the
phoenix
triumphantly
just
as
i
thought
believe
me
my
dear
fellow
when
you
have
been
around
as
long
as
have
you
can
read
the
minds
of
your
friends
as
easily
as
a
book
now
the
problem
of
what
to
give
is
a
hard
one
at
any
time
but
the
problem
of
what
to
give
for
a
five
hundredth
birthday
is
even
harder
a
monogrammed
ash
tray
i
do
not
receive
cigars
often
enough
to
make
that
practical
a
sweater
it
would
not
fit
they
never
do
a
watch
chain
i
have
no
watch
no
the
best
idea
would
be
to
get
me
something
which
i
can
use
certainly
phoenix
david
stammered
what
you
want
then
ah
we
have
reached
the
kernel
of
the
problem
and
the
answer
my
boy
is
this
cinnamon
cinnamon
precisely
also
a
box
of
matches
the
kind
that
strike
anywhere
you
know
well
all
right
it
does
sound
like
much
of
a
present
but
if
that
what
you
really
want
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
phoenix
i
mean
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
the
plain
fact
is
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
doubtfully
the
plain
fact
is
well
i
do
not
know
odd
but
something
tells
me
i
shall
need
them
well
it
will
come
to
me
in
the
morning
no
doubt
and
then
of
course
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
them
on
hand
all
right
cinnamon
and
matches
then
and
i
get
some
no
i
tell
you
it
be
a
surprise
a
surprise
splendid
my
boy
you
could
not
i
suppose
drop
me
a
small
hint
no
but
of
course
not
one
hint
and
my
powerful
intellect
could
guess
everything
and
then
the
surprise
would
be
spoiled
well
until
tomorrow
then
illustration
that
evening
david
shut
himself
in
his
room
and
robbed
his
bank
it
was
a
squat
box
with
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
earned
in
raised
letters
on
one
side
the
only
way
to
open
it
was
to
smash
it
with
a
crowbar
but
it
could
be
emptied
it
had
to
be
tilted
just
so
with
a
knife
blade
in
the
slot
to
catch
the
coins
and
guide
them
out
this
is
what
david
did
with
a
bread
knife
borrowed
from
the
kitchen
it
was
a
slow
uncertain
job
and
one
coin
he
guessed
it
was
a
dime
by
the
way
it
rattled
never
did
come
out
but
the
rest
which
included
his
change
from
uncle
charles
present
would
be
enough
early
next
morning
he
went
to
the
store
and
bought
three
large
boxes
of
stick
cinnamon
two
cans
of
powdered
cinnamon
and
a
huge
box
of
matches
for
the
surprise
he
got
a
whole
quart
of
strawberry
ice
cream
with
a
piece
of
dry
ice
to
keep
it
from
melting
he
wanted
to
buy
a
cake
too
and
candles
but
there
was
not
enough
money
left
then
he
remembered
that
a
new
batch
of
cookies
had
been
baked
at
home
yesterday
which
would
have
to
do
instead
he
wrapped
the
cinnamon
and
matches
up
in
a
neat
package
with
white
paper
tied
it
in
a
blue
ribbon
and
wrote
on
it
to
feenix
happy
birthday
from
david
then
he
took
all
the
cookies
from
the
jar
borrowed
two
plates
and
spoons
put
everything
into
a
large
paper
bag
and
set
out
for
the
phoenix
ledge
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
phoenix
working
busily
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
place
on
the
ledge
apparently
the
bird
had
been
at
it
all
night
for
a
huge
pile
of
sticks
and
brush
had
been
heaped
up
on
the
ground
and
shaped
roughly
like
a
nest
right
now
the
phoenix
was
struggling
with
a
small
log
trying
to
get
it
on
the
pile
hello
phoenix
happy
birthday
ah
there
my
boy
thank
you
very
much
could
you
kindly
give
me
a
hand
with
this
log
they
heaved
and
grunted
the
piece
of
wood
to
the
top
of
the
pile
and
david
said
what
this
for
phoenix
this
my
boy
is
a
pyre
a
bit
untidy
around
the
edges
but
nonetheless
a
pyre
oh
said
david
what
that
well
a
you
know
a
sort
of
fire
as
it
were
oh
i
thought
you
said
oh
yes
fire
is
it
awfully
for
a
fire
the
weather
unusually
tropical
said
the
phoenix
cocking
one
eye
toward
the
sun
this
fire
however
is
necessary
but
i
shall
explain
later
meanwhile
if
you
will
just
aid
me
with
this
branch
and
for
the
next
fifteen
minutes
they
worked
over
the
heap
adding
to
it
and
shaping
it
up
david
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
he
could
see
that
the
phoenix
knew
what
it
was
doing
so
everything
must
be
all
right
by
the
way
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
casually
when
they
had
finished
my
prediction
was
correct
i
knew
it
would
be
the
inevitable
has
occurred
what
are
you
talking
about
phoenix
the
scientist
my
boy
he
is
in
our
midst
once
more
david
clutched
a
branch
in
the
heap
and
said
oh
phoenix
in
a
frightened
voice
now
my
dear
fellow
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
he
is
not
nearby
at
present
i
sent
him
back
sent
him
back
how
nothing
to
it
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
smugly
he
was
up
at
the
crack
of
dawn
toiling
with
typical
stupidity
in
full
sight
on
the
slope
below
he
was
making
a
blind
of
green
branches
to
hide
in
while
he
spies
on
me
really
the
childishness
of
his
efforts
to
think
for
a
minute
he
could
fool
with
such
tricks
well
i
waited
until
he
had
gone
down
the
slope
to
cut
more
greenery
and
when
his
back
was
turned
i
slipped
down
to
the
blind
and
took
his
binoculars
but
phoenix
what
did
you
want
with
his
binoculars
i
did
not
want
his
binoculars
my
boy
but
did
his
language
when
he
discovered
the
loss
was
simply
frightful
i
could
hear
it
all
the
way
up
here
of
course
he
had
to
return
to
town
for
another
pair
but
he
be
back
precisely
my
boy
but
he
will
have
something
to
keep
him
busy
when
he
returns
i
took
the
liberty
of
destroying
his
blind
will
hold
him
but
it
wo
hold
him
long
phoenix
we
got
to
think
of
something
else
now
your
whole
birthday
is
spoiled
on
the
contrary
my
boy
it
will
hold
him
long
enough
now
please
do
not
ask
me
why
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
and
i
shall
explain
later
and
my
birthday
is
spoiled
i
am
looking
forward
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
the
surprise
which
you
promised
me
come
let
us
enjoy
it
whatever
it
is
and
forget
the
scientist
well
are
you
about
the
scientist
absolutely
the
phoenix
was
so
positive
that
david
began
to
feel
better
he
picked
up
the
paper
bag
and
said
well
it
is
much
of
a
surprise
really
just
a
birthday
party
and
your
present
but
i
think
the
present
should
come
after
the
party
do
you
quite
so
my
boy
but
i
shall
leave
the
management
of
the
whole
affair
in
your
capable
hands
all
right
said
david
now
you
have
to
turn
around
phoenix
and
not
look
while
i
getting
it
ready
the
phoenix
obediently
turned
around
clasping
its
wings
behind
its
back
and
tried
hard
not
to
peek
david
set
the
party
things
out
on
the
grass
ice
cream
in
the
middle
the
cookies
in
a
ring
around
it
plates
on
either
side
and
spoons
beside
the
plates
he
set
the
phoenix
present
off
to
one
side
where
it
could
be
reached
when
they
had
finished
all
right
phoenix
you
can
turn
around
now
the
phoenix
took
a
long
look
at
everything
and
said
huskily
my
dear
chap
this
is
quite
the
nicest
moment
of
my
life
how
can
i
possibly
thank
you
they
sat
down
in
their
places
david
passed
the
cookies
and
served
the
ice
cream
and
said
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
this
was
the
best
birthday
party
he
had
ever
been
to
and
the
phoenix
said
quite
so
my
boy
but
might
i
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
why
and
david
answered
well
the
reason
is
that
usually
during
birthday
parties
you
have
to
play
stupid
games
like
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
eating
good
things
is
the
real
reason
for
having
a
party
as
everybody
knows
and
the
phoenix
said
precisely
my
boy
but
people
have
somehow
lost
the
main
idea
of
the
thing
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
ice
cream
is
the
basis
of
any
sensible
party
and
everything
else
is
a
waste
of
time
and
david
said
yes
phoenix
but
do
forget
cake
and
cookies
and
candy
and
nuts
and
things
they
not
as
good
as
ice
cream
but
they
not
a
complete
waste
of
time
either
and
the
phoenix
said
of
course
not
my
dear
fellow
they
are
important
too
and
speaking
of
ice
cream
have
you
noticed
that
while
chocolate
is
very
good
and
vanilla
enjoys
great
popularity
still
there
is
like
strawberry
and
david
said
yes
you
right
rather
sadly
because
the
phoenix
was
eating
most
of
it
at
last
the
ice
cream
carton
was
empty
and
all
the
cookies
were
gone
they
both
sighed
regretfully
and
brushed
away
the
crumbs
and
the
phoenix
looked
hopefully
at
the
present
david
had
brought
happy
birthday
phoenix
david
said
and
he
handed
the
gift
over
with
a
little
bow
thank
you
my
boy
thank
you
the
phoenix
opened
the
package
eagerly
and
gave
a
pleased
cry
what
i
wanted
my
dear
chap
i
glad
you
like
it
david
said
do
you
know
yet
what
it
for
can
you
really
use
it
for
something
the
phoenix
suddenly
stopped
smiling
and
looked
at
david
with
a
strange
expression
on
its
face
an
expression
david
had
never
seen
there
before
a
vague
dread
swept
through
him
and
he
faltered
phoenix
you
know
what
it
for
what
is
it
tell
me
well
my
boy
well
the
fact
yes
i
do
know
it
came
to
me
this
morning
while
i
was
constructing
the
ah
nest
here
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
a
bit
hard
to
explain
the
cinnamon
ah
the
cinnamon
well
cinnamon
are
what
i
should
really
have
but
phoenix
what
it
behold
my
boy
the
phoenix
opened
the
boxes
and
spread
the
cinnamon
sticks
on
the
nest
then
it
took
the
cans
and
sprinkled
the
cinnamon
powder
over
the
top
and
sides
of
the
heap
until
the
whole
nest
was
a
red
there
we
are
my
boy
said
the
phoenix
sadly
the
traditional
cinnamon
pyre
of
the
phoenix
celebrated
in
song
and
story
and
with
the
third
mention
of
the
word
pyre
david
legs
went
weak
and
something
seemed
to
catch
in
his
throat
he
remembered
now
where
he
had
heard
that
word
before
it
was
in
his
book
of
explorers
and
it
meant
it
meant
phoenix
he
choked
is
the
pyre
for
for
myself
said
the
phoenix
now
i
implore
you
please
oh
dear
i
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
look
at
me
my
boy
david
did
as
he
was
told
although
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
he
could
not
see
through
the
blur
now
said
the
phoenix
gently
the
fact
is
that
i
have
besides
my
unusually
acute
intellect
an
instinct
this
instinct
told
me
that
it
was
my
birthday
today
it
also
told
me
to
build
this
nest
of
cinnamon
now
it
tells
me
that
i
must
make
this
nest
my
pyre
because
that
is
what
the
phoenix
does
at
the
end
of
five
hundred
years
now
please
my
boy
i
admit
it
does
not
appear
to
be
a
very
joyful
way
of
celebrating
but
it
must
be
done
this
is
the
traditional
end
of
the
phoenix
my
boy
and
we
can
not
ignore
the
tradition
no
matter
what
our
feelings
may
be
do
you
see
no
david
cried
please
phoenix
do
do
it
it
horrible
i
wo
let
you
do
it
but
i
must
my
dear
chap
i
can
not
help
it
this
is
what
it
means
to
be
the
phoenix
nothing
can
stop
the
tradition
please
my
boy
do
not
take
on
so
it
is
not
in
the
least
horrible
i
assure
you
my
instinct
tells
me
so
you
said
you
were
going
to
give
me
an
education
david
sobbed
you
said
we
would
see
you
said
and
we
only
been
on
four
adventures
you
never
told
me
about
this
i
am
terribly
sorry
my
boy
i
could
not
tell
you
about
it
because
i
did
not
about
it
until
now
as
for
your
education
it
is
a
pity
to
have
it
cut
short
in
this
way
i
had
great
plans
but
consider
you
have
had
four
adventures
which
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
has
had
and
besides
my
boy
we
shall
see
each
other
again
i
do
not
know
how
or
where
but
i
am
positive
of
it
the
phoenix
flicked
a
tear
from
its
eye
with
the
tip
of
one
wing
while
with
the
other
it
patted
david
awkwardly
on
the
shoulder
do
go
phoenix
do
go
i
must
my
boy
here
permit
me
to
present
you
with
a
small
token
ouch
of
our
friendship
dimly
through
his
tears
david
saw
the
phoenix
pluck
the
longest
bluest
feather
from
its
tail
and
he
felt
it
being
pressed
into
his
hand
david
said
the
phoenix
gruffly
david
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
turned
and
rushed
blindly
from
the
phoenix
blundered
into
the
thicket
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
behind
him
he
heard
the
sticks
snapping
as
the
phoenix
mounted
its
pyre
a
match
rasped
against
the
box
the
first
tongue
of
flame
sizzled
in
the
branches
david
pressed
his
hands
over
his
ears
to
shut
out
the
sound
but
he
could
feel
the
heat
of
the
flames
as
they
sprang
up
and
the
noise
would
not
be
shut
out
it
grew
and
grew
popping
crackling
roaring
until
it
seemed
to
fill
the
world
perhaps
he
fainted
or
perhaps
from
numbness
he
slipped
into
a
kind
of
deep
sleep
whichever
it
was
he
returned
to
consciousness
again
suddenly
his
hands
had
slipped
from
his
ears
and
a
sound
had
brought
him
back
he
lifted
his
head
and
listened
the
fire
had
burnt
itself
out
now
the
only
noise
was
the
hiss
and
pop
of
dying
embers
but
these
sounds
were
too
gentle
to
have
awakened
him
it
must
have
been
something
else
yes
it
was
a
voice
he
could
hear
it
quite
plainly
now
there
were
angry
shouts
coming
from
somewhere
below
the
ledge
carefully
avoiding
the
sight
of
the
pyre
david
crawled
to
the
edge
and
glanced
over
far
down
on
the
slope
at
the
foot
of
the
scarp
was
a
tiny
figure
dancing
and
bellowing
with
rage
the
scientist
had
returned
and
discovered
the
ruins
of
his
blind
david
watched
him
dully
no
need
to
worry
about
any
more
how
harmless
he
looked
now
even
ridiculous
david
turned
away
he
noticed
then
that
he
was
holding
something
in
his
hand
something
soft
and
heavy
as
he
lifted
it
to
look
more
closely
it
flashed
in
the
sunlight
it
was
the
feather
the
phoenix
had
given
him
the
tail
feather
tail
feather
but
the
phoenix
tail
had
been
a
sapphire
blue
the
feather
in
his
hand
was
of
the
purest
palest
gold
there
was
a
slight
stir
behind
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
glanced
at
the
remains
of
the
pyre
his
mouth
dropped
open
in
the
middle
of
the
white
ashes
and
glowing
coals
there
was
movement
something
within
was
struggling
up
toward
the
top
the
noises
grew
stronger
and
more
definite
charred
sticks
were
being
snapped
ashes
kicked
aside
embers
pushed
out
of
the
way
now
like
a
plant
thrusting
its
way
out
of
the
soil
there
appeared
something
pale
and
glittering
which
nodded
in
the
breeze
little
tongues
of
flame
it
seemed
licking
out
into
the
air
no
not
flames
a
crest
of
golden
feathers
a
heave
from
below
lifted
the
ashes
in
the
center
of
the
pile
a
fine
cloud
of
flakes
swirled
up
into
the
breeze
there
was
a
flash
of
sunlight
glinting
on
brilliant
plumage
and
from
the
ruins
of
the
pyre
stepped
forth
a
magnificent
bird
it
was
the
phoenix
it
must
be
the
phoenix
but
it
was
a
new
and
different
phoenix
it
was
young
and
wild
with
a
fierce
amber
eye
its
crest
was
tall
and
proud
its
body
the
slim
muscular
body
of
a
hunter
its
wings
narrow
and
long
and
pointed
like
a
falcon
the
great
beak
and
talons
and
curving
and
all
of
it
from
crest
to
talons
was
a
burnished
gold
that
reflected
the
sun
in
a
thousand
dazzling
lights
the
bird
stretched
its
wings
shook
the
ash
from
its
tail
and
began
to
preen
itself
every
movement
was
like
the
flash
of
a
silent
explosion
phoenix
david
whispered
phoenix
the
bird
started
turned
toward
him
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
with
wild
fearless
eyes
then
continued
its
preening
suddenly
it
stopped
and
cocked
its
head
as
if
listening
to
something
then
david
heard
it
too
a
shout
down
the
mountainside
louder
and
clearer
now
excited
and
jubilant
he
shivered
and
looked
down
the
scientist
was
tearing
up
the
goat
trail
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
carry
him
and
he
was
waving
a
rifle
phoenix
david
cried
fly
fly
phoenix
the
bird
looked
at
the
scientist
then
at
david
its
glance
curious
but
without
understanding
paralyzed
with
fear
david
remained
on
his
knees
as
the
scientist
reached
an
open
place
and
threw
the
gun
up
to
his
shoulder
the
bullet
went
whining
by
with
an
ugly
and
the
report
of
the
gun
echoed
along
the
scarp
illustration
fly
phoenix
david
sobbed
a
second
bullet
snarled
at
the
bird
and
spattered
out
little
chips
of
rock
from
the
inner
wall
of
the
ledge
oh
fly
fly
david
jumped
up
and
flung
himself
between
the
bird
and
the
scientist
it
me
he
cried
it
david
the
bird
gazed
at
him
closely
and
a
light
flickered
in
its
eye
as
though
the
name
had
reached
out
and
almost
but
not
quite
touched
an
ancient
memory
hesitantly
it
stretched
forth
one
wing
and
with
the
tip
of
it
lightly
brushed
david
forehead
leaving
there
a
mark
that
burned
coolly
away
from
that
bird
you
little
idiot
the
scientist
shrieked
away
david
ignored
him
fly
phoenix
he
cried
and
he
pushed
the
bird
toward
the
edge
understanding
dawned
in
the
amber
eyes
at
last
the
bird
with
one
clear
defiant
cry
leaped
to
an
boulder
the
golden
wings
spread
the
golden
neck
curved
back
the
golden
talons
pushed
against
the
rock
the
bird
launched
itself
into
the
air
and
soared
out
over
the
valley
sparkling
flashing
shimmering
a
flame
large
as
a
sunburst
a
meteor
a
diamond
a
star
diminishing
at
last
to
a
speck
of
gold
dust
which
glimmered
twice
in
the
distance
before
it
was
gone

the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
he
graduated
in
and
since
then
has
been
busy
writing
sailing
as
able
seaman
aboard
a
tanker
and
working
as
a
bookstore
clerk
and
machine
tender
he
lives
in
berkeley
california
he
is
married
and
has
one
son
it
was
while
ormondroyd
was
at
college
that
david
and
the
phoenix
first
intruded
into
his
consciousness
day
when
i
was
walking
across
campus
i
had
a
sudden
vision
of
a
large
and
pompous
bird
diving
out
of
a
window
tripping
on
the
sill
and
falling
into
a
rose
arbor
below
i
had
to
explain
to
myself
why
the
poor
bird
was
in
such
a
situation
in
the
first
place
and
what
became
of
it
afterwards
the
result
of
my
investigation
david
and
the
phoenix
david
and
the
phoenix
edward
ormondroyd
by
joan
david
knew
that
one
should
be
prepared
for
anything
when
one
climbs
a
mountain
but
he
never
dreamed
what
he
would
find
that
june
morning
on
the
mountain
ledge
there
stood
an
enormous
bird
with
a
head
like
an
eagle
a
neck
like
a
swan
and
a
scarlet
crest
the
most
astonishing
thing
was
that
the
bird
had
an
open
book
on
the
ground
and
was
reading
from
it
this
was
david
first
sight
of
the
fabulous
phoenix
and
the
beginning
of
a
pleasant
and
profitable
partnership
the
phoenix
found
a
great
deal
lacking
in
david
education
he
flunked
questions
like
how
do
you
tell
a
true
from
a
false
unicorn
and
undertook
to
supplement
it
with
a
practical
education
an
education
that
would
be
a
preparation
for
life
the
education
had
to
be
combined
with
offensive
and
defensive
measures
against
a
scientist
who
was
bent
on
capturing
the
phoenix
but
the
two
projects
together
involved
exciting
and
hilarious
adventures
for
boy
and
bird
a
wonderful
book
adventurous
and
very
funny
with
much
of
the
magic
as
well
as
the
humor
of
the
fantastic
publishing
chicago
