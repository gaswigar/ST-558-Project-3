has
recorded
an

of

when
urged

hemart
to
vote
for
the
condemnation
of
moreau
ah
monsieur
if
we
condemn
him
how
shall
we
be
able
to
acquit
ourselves
i
have
besides
the
best
reason
for
asserting
that
the
judges
were
tampered
with
from
a
circumstance
which
occurred
to
myself
bonaparte
knew
that
i
was
intimately
connected
with
desmaisons
one
of
the
members
of
the
tribunal
and
brother
to
corvisart
he
also
knew
that
desmaisons
was
inclined
to
believe
in
moreau
innocence
and
favourable
to
his
acquittal
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
corvisart
arrived
at
my
house
one
morning
at
a
very
early
hour
in
a
state
of
such
evident
embarrassment
that
before
he
had
time
to
utter
a
word
i
said
to
him
what
is
the
matter
have
you
heard
any
bad
news
no
replied
corvisart
but
i
came
by
the
emperor
order
he
wishes
you
to
see
my
is
said
he
to
me
senior
judge
and
a
man
of
considerable
eminence
his
opinion
will
carry
with
it
great
weight
and
i
know
that
he
is
favourable
to
moreau
he
is
in
the
wrong
visit
bourrienne
said
the
emperor
and
concert
with
him
respecting
the
best
method
of
convincing
desmaisons
of
his
error
for
i
repeat
he
is
wrong
he
is
deceived
this
is
the
mission
with
which
i
am
entrusted
how
said
i
with
thorough
astonishment
how
came
you
to
be
employed
in
this
affair
could
you
believe
for
one
moment
that
i
would
tamper
with
a
magistrate
in
order
to
induce
him
to
exercise
an
unjust
rigour
no
rest
assured
replied
corvisart
i
merely
visited
you
this
morning
in
obedience
to
the
order
of
the
emperor
but
i
knew
beforehand
in
what
manner
you
would
regard
the
proposition
with
which
i
was
charged
i
knew
your
opinions
and
your
character
too
well
to
entertain
the
smallest
doubt
in
this
respect
and
i
was
convinced
that
i
ran
no
risk
in
becoming
the
bearer
of
a
commission
which
would
be
attended
with
no
effect
besides
had
i
refused
to
obey
the
emperor
it
would
have
proved
prejudicial
to
your
interest
and
confirmed
him
in
the
opinion
that
you
were
favourable
to
the
acquittal
of
moreau
for
myself
added
corvisart
it
is
needless
to
affirm
that
i
have
no
intention
of
attempting
to
influence
the
opinion
of
my
and
if
i
had
you
know
him
sufficiently
well
to
be
convinced
in
what
light
he
would
regard
such
a
proceeding
such
were
the
object
and
result
of
corvisart
visit
and
i
am
thence
led
to
believe
that
similar
attempts
must
have
been
made
to
influence
other
members
of
the
tribunal
the
judges
had
been
pressed
and
acted
on
in
a
thousand
ways
by
the
hangerson
of
the
palace
and
especially
by
real
the
natural
intermediary
between
justice
and
the
government
ambition
servility
fear
every
motive
capable
of
influencing
them
had
been
used
even
their
humane
scruples
were
employed
lanfrey
tome
iii
who
goes
on
to
say
that
the
judges
were
urged
to
sentence
moreau
to
death
in
order
that
the
emperor
might
fully
pardon
him
but
however
this
may
be
prudence
led
me
to
discontinue
visiting
desmaisons
with
whom
i
was
in
habits
of
the
strictest
friendship
about
this
period
i
paid
a
visit
which
occupies
an
important
place
in
my
recollections
on
the
of
june
four
days
after
the
condemnation
of
georges
and
his
accomplices
i
received
a
summons
to
attend
the
emperor
at
st
cloud
it
was
thursday
and
as
i
thought
on
the
great
events
and
tragic
scenes
about
to
be
acted
i
was
rather
uneasy
respecting
his
intentions
but
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
my
friend
rapp
in
waiting
who
said
to
me
as
i
entered
be
not
alarmed
he
is
in
the
best
of
humours
at
present
and
wishes
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
rapp
then
announced
me
to
the
emperor
and
i
was
immediately
admitted
to
his
presence
after
pinching
my
ear
and
asking
his
usual
questions
such
as
what
does
the
world
say
how
are
your
children
what
are
you
about
he
said
to
me
by
the
by
have
you
attended
the
proceedings
against
moreau
yes
sire
i
have
not
been
absent
during
one
of
the
sittings
well
bourrienne
are
you
of
the
opinion
that
moreau
is
innocent
yes
sire
at
least
i
am
certain
that
nothing
has
come
out
in
the
course
of
the
trial
tending
to
criminate
him
i
am
even
surprised
how
he
came
to
be
implicated
in
this
conspiracy
since
nothing
has
appeared
against
him
which
has
the
most
remote
connexion
with
the
affair
i
know
your
opinion
on
this
subject
duroc
related
to
me
the
conversation
you
held
with
him
at
the
tuileries
experience
has
shown
that
you
were
correct
but
how
could
i
act
otherwise
you
know
that
bouvet
de
lozier
hanged
himself
in
prison
and
was
only
saved
by
accident
real
hurried
to
the
temple
in
order
to
interrogate
him
and
in
his
first
confessions
he
criminated
moreau
affirming
that
he
had
held
repeated
conferences
with
pichegru
real
immediately
reported
to
me
this
fact
and
proposed
that
moreau
should
be
arrested
since
the
rumours
against
him
seemed
to
be
well
founded
he
had
previously
made
the
same
proposition
i
at
first
refused
my
sanction
to
this
measure
but
after
the
charge
made
against
him
by
bouvet
de
lozier
how
could
i
act
otherwise
than
i
did
could
i
suffer
such
open
conspiracies
against
the
government
could
i
doubt
the
truth
of
bouvet
de
lozier
declaration
under
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
made
could
i
foresee
that
he
would
deny
his
first
declaration
when
brought
before
the
court
there
was
a
chain
of
circumstances
which
human
sagacity
could
not
penetrate
and
i
consented
to
the
arrest
of
moreau
when
it
was
proved
that
he
was
in
league
with
pichegru
has
not
england
sent
assassins
sire
said
i
permit
me
to
call
to
your
recollection
the
conversation
you
had
in
my
presence
with
fox
after
which
you
said
to
me
i
am
very
happy
at
having
heard
from
the
mouth
of
a
man
of
honour
that
the
british
government
is
incapable
of
seeking
my
life
i
always
wish
to
esteem
my
bah
you
are
a
fool
parbleu
i
did
not
say
that
the
english
minister
sent
over
an
assassin
and
that
he
said
to
him
is
gold
and
a
poniard
go
and
kill
the
first
consul
no
i
did
not
believe
that
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
all
those
foreign
conspirators
against
my
government
were
serving
england
and
receiving
pay
from
that
power
have
i
agents
in
london
to
disturb
the
government
of
great
britain
i
have
waged
with
it
honourable
warfare
i
have
not
attempted
to
awaken
a
remembrance
of
the
stuarts
amongst
their
old
partisans
is
not
wright
who
landed
georges
and
his
accomplices
at
dieppe
a
captain
in
the
british
navy
but
rest
assured
that
with
the
exception
of
a
few
babblers
whom
i
can
easily
silence
the
hearts
of
the
french
people
are
with
me
everywhere
public
opinion
has
been
declared
in
my
favour
so
that
i
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
giving
the
greatest
publicity
to
these
plots
and
bringing
the
accused
to
a
solemn
trial
the
greater
number
of
those
gentlemen
wished
me
to
bring
the
prisoners
before
a
military
commission
that
summary
judgment
might
be
obtained
but
i
refused
my
consent
to
this
measure
it
might
have
been
said
that
i
dreaded
public
opinion
and
i
fear
it
not
people
may
talk
as
much
as
they
please
well
and
good
i
am
not
obliged
to
hear
them
but
i
do
not
like
those
who
are
attached
to
my
person
to
blame
what
i
have
done
as
i
could
not
wholly
conceal
an
involuntary
emotion
in
which
the
emperor
saw
something
more
than
mere
surprise
he
paused
took
me
by
the
ear
and
smiling
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
said
i
had
no
reference
to
you
in
what
i
said
but
i
have
to
complain
of
lacuee
could
you
believe
that
during
the
trial
he
went
about
clamouring
in
behalf
of
moreau
he
my
aide
de
camp
a
man
who
owes
everything
to
me
as
for
you
i
have
said
that
you
acted
very
well
in
this
affair
i
know
not
sire
what
has
either
been
done
or
said
by
lacuee
whom
i
have
not
seen
for
a
long
time
what
i
said
to
duroc
is
what
history
teaches
in
every
page
by
the
by
resumed
the
emperor
after
a
short
silence
do
you
know
that
it
was
i
myself
who
discovered
that
pichegru
was
in
paris
everyone
said
to
me
pichegru
is
in
paris
fouche
real
harped
on
the
same
string
but
could
give
me
no
proof
of
their
assertion
a
fool
you
are
said
i
to
real
when
in
an
instant
you
may
ascertain
the
fact
pichegru
has
a
brother
an
aged
ecclesiastic
who
resides
in
paris
let
his
dwelling
be
searched
and
should
he
be
absent
it
will
warrant
a
suspicion
that
pichegru
is
here
if
on
the
contrary
his
brother
should
be
at
home
let
him
be
arrested
he
is
a
man
and
in
the
first
moments
of
agitation
will
betray
the
truth
everything
happened
as
i
had
foreseen
for
no
sooner
was
he
arrested
than
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
he
inquired
if
it
was
a
crime
to
have
received
his
brother
into
his
house
thus
every
doubt
was
removed
and
a
miscreant
in
the
house
in
which
pichegru
lodged
betrayed
him
to
the
police
what
horrid
degradation
to
betray
a
friend
for
the
sake
of
gold
then
reverting
to
moreau
the
emperor
talked
a
great
deal
respecting
that
general
moreau
he
said
possesses
many
good
qualities
his
bravery
is
undoubted
but
he
has
more
courage
than
energy
he
is
indolent
and
effeminate
when
with
the
army
he
lived
like
a
pasha
he
smoked
was
almost
constantly
in
bed
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
his
dispositions
are
naturally
good
but
he
is
too
indolent
for
study
he
does
not
read
and
since
he
has
been
tied
to
his
apronstrings
is
fit
for
nothing
he
sees
only
with
the
eyes
of
his
wife
and
her
mother
who
have
had
a
hand
in
all
these
late
plots
and
then
bourrienne
is
it
not
very
strange
that
it
was
by
my
advice
that
he
entered
into
this
union
i
was
told
that
mademoiselle
hulot
was
a
creole
and
i
believed
that
he
would
find
in
her
a
second
josephine
how
greatly
was
i
mistaken
it
is
these
women
who
have
estranged
us
from
each
other
and
i
regret
that
he
should
have
acted
so
unworthily
you
must
remember
my
observing
to
you
more
than
two
years
ago
that
moreau
would
one
day
run
his
head
against
the
gate
of
the
tuileries
that
he
has
done
so
was
no
fault
of
mine
for
you
know
how
much
i
did
to
secure
his
attachment
you
can
not
have
forgotten
the
reception
i
gave
him
at
malmaison
on
the
brumaire
i
conferred
on
him
the
charge
of
the
luxembourg
and
in
that
situation
he
fully
justified
my
choice
but
since
that
period
he
has
behaved
towards
me
with
the
utmost
ingratitude
entered
into
all
the
silly
cabala
against
me
blamed
all
my
measures
and
turned
into
ridicule
the
legion
of
honour
have
not
some
of
the
intriguers
put
it
into
his
head
that
i
regard
him
with
jealousy
you
must
be
aware
of
that
you
must
also
know
as
well
as
i
how
anxious
the
members
of
the
directory
were
to
exalt
the
reputation
of
moreau
alarmed
at
my
success
in
italy
they
wished
to
have
in
the
armies
a
general
to
serve
as
a
counterpoise
to
my
renown
i
have
ascended
the
throne
and
he
is
the
inmate
of
a
prison
you
are
aware
of
the
incessant
clamouring
raised
against
me
by
the
whole
family
at
which
i
confess
i
was
very
much
displeased
coming
from
those
whom
i
had
treated
so
well
had
he
attached
himself
to
me
i
would
doubtless
have
conferred
on
him
the
title
of
first
marshal
of
the
empire
but
what
could
i
do
he
constantly
depreciated
my
campaigns
and
my
government
from
discontent
to
revolt
there
is
frequently
only
one
step
especially
when
a
man
of
a
weak
character
becomes
the
tool
of
popular
clubs
and
therefore
when
i
was
first
informed
that
moreau
was
implicated
in
the
conspiracy
of
georges
i
believed
him
to
be
guilty
but
hesitated
to
issue
an
order
for
his
arrest
till
i
had
taken
the
opinion
of
my
council
the
members
having
assembled
i
ordered
the
different
documents
to
be
laid
before
them
with
an
injunction
to
examine
them
with
the
utmost
care
since
they
related
to
an
affair
of
importance
and
i
urged
them
candidly
to
inform
me
whether
in
their
opinion
any
of
the
charges
against
moreau
were
sufficiently
strong
to
endanger
his
life
the
fools
their
reply
was
in
the
affirmative
i
believe
they
were
even
unanimous
then
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
suffer
the
proceedings
to
take
their
course
it
is
unnecessary
to
affirm
to
you
bourrienne
that
moreau
never
should
have
perished
on
a
scaffold
most
assuredly
i
would
have
pardoned
him
but
with
the
sentence
of
death
hanging
over
his
head
he
could
no
longer
have
proved
dangerous
and
his
name
would
have
ceased
to
be
a
for
disaffected
republicans
or
imbecile
royalists
had
the
council
expressed
any
doubts
respecting
his
guilt
i
would
have
intimated
to
him
that
the
suspicions
against
him
were
so
strong
as
to
render
any
further
connection
between
us
impossible
and
that
the
best
course
he
could
pursue
would
be
to
leave
france
for
three
years
under
the
pretext
of
visiting
some
of
the
places
rendered
celebrated
during
the
late
wars
but
that
if
he
preferred
a
diplomatic
mission
i
would
make
a
suitable
provision
for
his
expenses
and
the
great
innovator
time
might
effect
great
changes
during
the
period
of
his
absence
but
my
foolish
council
affirmed
to
me
that
his
guilt
as
a
principal
being
evident
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
bring
him
to
trial
and
now
his
sentence
is
only
that
of
a
pickpocket
what
think
you
i
ought
to
do
detain
him
he
might
still
prove
a
no
let
him
sell
his
property
and
quit
can
i
confine
him
in
the
temple
it
is
full
enough
without
him
still
if
this
had
been
the
only
great
error
they
had
led
me
to
commit
sire
how
greatly
you
have
been
deceived
oh
yes
i
have
been
so
but
i
can
not
see
everything
with
my
own
eyes
at
this
part
of
our
conversation
of
which
i
have
suppressed
my
own
share
as
much
as
possible
i
conceived
that
the
last
words
of
bonaparte
alluded
to
the
death
of
the
duc
and
i
fancied
he
was
about
to
mention
that
event
but
he
again
spoke
of
moreau
he
is
very
much
mistaken
resumed
the
emperor
if
he
conceives
i
bore
any
towards
him
after
his
arrest
i
sent
lauriston
to
the
temple
whom
i
chose
because
he
was
of
an
amiable
and
conciliating
disposition
i
charged
him
to
tell
moreau
to
confess
he
had
only
seen
pichegru
and
i
would
cause
the
proceedings
against
him
to
be
suspended
instead
of
receiving
this
act
of
generosity
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
replied
to
it
with
great
haughtiness
so
much
was
he
elated
that
pichegru
had
not
been
arrested
he
afterwards
however
lowered
his
tone
he
wrote
to
me
a
letter
of
excuse
respecting
his
anterior
conduct
which
i
caused
to
be
produced
on
the
trial
he
was
the
author
of
his
own
ruin
besides
it
would
have
required
men
of
a
different
stamp
from
moreau
to
conspire
against
me
amoung
the
conspirators
for
example
was
an
individual
whose
fate
i
regret
this
georges
in
my
hands
might
have
achieved
great
things
i
can
duly
appreciate
the
firmness
of
character
he
displayed
and
to
which
i
could
have
given
a
proper
direction
i
caused
real
to
intimate
to
him
that
if
he
would
attach
himself
to
me
not
only
should
he
be
pardoned
but
that
i
would
give
him
the
command
of
a
regiment
perhaps
i
might
even
have
made
him
my
aide
de
camp
complaints
would
have
been
made
but
parbleu
i
should
not
have
cared
georges
refused
all
my
offers
he
was
as
inflexible
as
iron
what
could
i
do
he
underwent
his
fate
for
he
was
a
dangerous
man
circumstances
rendered
his
death
a
matter
of
necessity
examples
of
severity
were
called
for
when
england
was
pouring
into
france
the
whole
offscouring
of
the
emigration
but
patience
patience
i
have
a
long
arm
and
shall
be
able
to
reach
them
when
necessary
moreau
regarded
georges
merely
as
a
ruffian
i
viewed
him
in
a
different
light
you
may
remember
the
conversation
i
had
with
him
at
the
tuileries
you
and
rapp
were
in
an
adjoining
cabinet
i
tried
in
vain
to
influence
him
some
of
his
associates
were
affected
at
the
mention
of
country
and
of
glory
he
alone
stood
cold
and
unmoved
i
addressed
myself
to
his
feelings
but
in
vain
he
was
insensible
to
everything
i
said
at
that
period
georges
appeared
to
me
little
ambitious
of
power
his
whole
wishes
seemed
to
centre
in
commanding
the
vendeans
it
was
not
till
i
had
exhausted
every
means
of
conciliation
that
i
assumed
the
tone
and
language
of
the
first
magistrate
i
dismissed
him
with
a
strong
injunction
to
live
retired
to
be
peaceable
and
obedient
not
to
misinterpret
the
motives
of
my
conduct
towards
himself
nor
attribute
to
weakness
what
was
merely
the
result
of
moderation
and
strength
assured
i
added
repeat
to
your
associates
that
while
i
hold
the
reins
of
authority
there
will
be
neither
chance
nor
salvation
for
those
who
dare
to
conspire
against
me
how
he
conformed
to
this
injunction
the
event
has
shown
real
told
me
that
when
moreau
and
georges
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
pichegru
they
could
not
come
to
any
understanding
because
georges
would
not
act
against
the
bourbons
well
he
had
a
plan
but
moreau
had
none
he
merely
wished
for
my
overthrow
without
having
formed
any
ulterior
views
whatever
this
showed
that
he
was
destitute
of
even
common
sense
apropos
bourrienne
have
you
seen
corvisart
yes
well
he
delivered
to
me
the
message
with
which
you
entrusted
him
and
desmaisons
i
wager
that
you
have
not
spoken
to
him
in
conformity
to
my
wishes
sire
the
estimation
in
which
i
hold
desmaisons
deterred
me
from
a
course
so
injurious
to
him
for
in
what
other
light
could
he
have
considered
what
i
should
have
said
to
him
i
have
never
visited
at
his
house
since
the
commencement
of
the
well
well
be
prudent
and
discreet
i
shall
not
forget
you
he
then
waved
a
very
gracious
salute
with
his
hand
and
withdrew
into
his
cabinet
the
emperor
had
detained
me
more
than
an
hour
on
leaving
the
chamber
i
passed
through
the
outer
salon
where
a
number
of
individuals
were
waiting
and
i
perceived
that
an
observance
of
etiquette
was
fast
gaining
ground
though
the
emperor
had
not
yet
adopted
the
admirable
institution
of
court
chamberlains
i
can
not
deny
that
i
was
much
gratified
with
my
reception
besides
i
was
beginning
to
be
weary
of
an
inactive
life
and
was
anxious
to
obtain
a
place
of
which
i
stood
in
great
need
from
the
losses
i
had
sustained
and
the
unjust
resumption
which
bonaparte
had
made
of
his
gifts
being
desirous
to
speak
of
napoleon
with
the
strictest
impartiality
i
prefer
drawing
my
conclusions
from
those
actions
in
which
i
had
no
personal
concern
i
shall
therefore
only
relate
here
even
before
giving
an
account
of
my
visit
to
the
empress
on
leaving
the
the
former
conduct
of
napoleon
towards
myself
and
madame
de
bourrienne
which
will
justify
the
momentary
alarm
with
which
i
was
seized
when
summoned
to
the
tuileries
and
the
satisfaction
i
felt
at
my
reception
i
had
a
proof
of
what
rapp
said
of
the
emperor
being
in
and
was
flattered
by
the
confidential
manner
in
which
he
spoke
to
me
concerning
some
of
the
great
political
secrets
of
his
government
on
seeing
me
come
out
rapp
observed
you
have
had
a
long
audience
yes
not
amiss
and
this
circumstance
procured
for
me
a
courtly
salutation
from
all
persons
waiting
in
the
antechamber
i
shall
now
relate
how
i
spent
the
two
preceding
years
the
month
after
i
tendered
my
resignation
to
the
first
consul
and
which
he
refused
to
accept
the
house
at
st
cloud
belonging
to
madame
deville
was
offered
to
me
it
was
that
in
which
the
due
and
the
due
de
berri
were
inoculated
i
visited
this
mansion
thinking
it
might
be
suitable
for
my
family
but
notwithstanding
the
beauty
of
its
situation
it
seemed
far
too
splendid
either
for
my
taste
or
my
fortune
except
the
outer
walls
it
was
in
a
very
dilapidated
state
and
would
require
numerous
and
expensive
repairs
josephine
being
informed
that
madame
de
bourrienne
had
set
her
face
against
the
purchase
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
mansion
and
accompanied
us
for
that
purpose
she
was
so
much
delighted
with
it
that
she
blamed
my
wife
for
starting
any
objections
to
my
becoming
its
possessor
with
regard
to
the
expense
josephine
replied
to
her
ah
we
shall
arrange
that
on
our
return
to
malmaison
she
spoke
of
it
in
such
high
terms
that
bonaparte
said
to
me
why
do
you
purchase
it
bourrienne
since
the
price
is
so
reasonable
the
house
was
accordingly
purchased
an
outlay
of
francs
was
immediately
required
to
render
it
habitable
furniture
was
also
necessary
for
this
large
mansion
and
orders
for
it
were
accordingly
given
but
no
sooner
were
repairs
begun
than
everything
crumbled
to
pieces
which
rendered
many
additional
expenses
necessary
about
this
period
bonaparte
hurried
forward
the
works
at
st
cloud
to
which
place
he
immediately
removed
my
services
being
constantly
required
i
found
it
so
fatiguing
to
go
twice
or
thrice
a
day
from
ruel
to
st
cloud
that
i
took
possession
of
my
new
mansion
though
it
was
still
filled
with
workmen
scarcely
eight
days
had
elapsed
from
this
period
when
bonaparte
intimated
that
he
no
longer
had
occasion
for
my
services
when
my
wife
went
to
take
leave
napoleon
spoke
to
her
in
a
flattering
manner
of
my
good
qualities
my
merit
and
the
utility
of
my
labours
saying
that
he
was
himself
the
most
unfortunate
of
the
three
and
that
my
loss
could
never
be
replaced
he
then
added
i
shall
be
absent
for
a
month
but
bourrienne
may
be
quite
easy
let
him
remain
in
retirement
and
on
my
return
i
shall
reward
his
services
should
i
even
create
a
place
on
purpose
for
him
madame
de
bourrienne
then
requested
leave
to
retain
the
apartments
appropriated
to
her
in
the
tuileries
till
after
her
accouchement
which
was
not
far
distant
to
which
he
replied
you
may
keep
them
as
long
as
you
please
for
it
will
be
some
time
before
i
again
reside
in
paris
bonaparte
set
out
on
his
journey
and
shortly
afterwards
i
went
with
my
family
to
visit
madame
de
coubertin
my
who
received
us
with
her
usual
kindness
we
passed
the
time
of
the
first
absence
at
her
country
seat
and
only
returned
to
st
cloud
on
the
day
bonaparte
was
expected
scarcely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
after
his
arrival
when
i
received
an
intimation
to
give
up
in
hours
the
apartments
in
the
tuileries
which
he
had
promised
my
wife
should
retain
till
after
her
confinement
he
reclaimed
at
the
same
time
the
furniture
of
ruel
which
he
presented
to
me
two
years
before
when
i
purchased
that
small
house
on
purpose
to
be
near
him
i
addressed
several
memorials
to
him
on
this
subject
stating
that
i
had
replaced
the
furniture
with
new
and
superior
articles
but
this
he
wholly
disregarded
compelling
me
to
give
up
everything
even
to
the
greatest
trifle
it
may
be
right
to
say
that
on
his
return
the
emperor
found
his
table
covered
with
information
respecting
my
conduct
in
paris
though
i
had
not
held
the
smallest
communication
with
any
one
in
the
capital
nor
once
entered
it
during
his
absence
after
my
departure
for
hamburg
bonaparte
took
possession
of
my
stables
and
which
he
filled
with
horses
even
the
very
avenues
and
walks
were
converted
into
stabling
a
handsome
house
at
the
entrance
to
the
park
was
also
appropriated
to
similar
purposes
in
fact
he
spared
nothing
everything
was
done
in
the
true
military
style
i
neither
had
previous
intimation
of
the
proceedings
nor
received
any
remuneration
for
my
loss
the
emperor
seemed
to
regard
the
property
as
his
own
but
though
he
all
but
ordered
me
to
make
the
purchase
he
did
not
furnish
the
money
that
was
paid
for
it
in
this
way
it
was
occupied
for
more
than
four
years
the
recollection
of
those
arbitrary
and
vexatious
proceedings
on
the
part
of
bonaparte
has
led
me
farther
than
i
intended
i
shall
therefore
return
to
the
imperial
residence
of
st
cloud
on
leaving
the
chamber
as
already
stated
i
repaired
to
the
apartments
of
the
empress
who
knowing
that
i
was
in
the
palace
had
intimated
her
wishes
for
my
attendance
no
command
could
have
been
more
agreeable
to
me
for
every
one
was
certain
of
a
gracious
reception
from
josephine
i
do
not
recollect
which
of
the
ladies
in
waiting
was
in
attendance
when
my
name
was
announced
but
she
immediately
retired
and
left
me
alone
with
josephine
her
recent
elevation
had
not
changed
the
usual
amenity
of
her
disposition
after
some
conversation
respecting
the
change
in
her
situation
i
gave
her
an
account
of
what
had
passed
between
the
emperor
and
myself
i
faithfully
related
all
that
he
had
said
of
moreau
observing
that
at
one
moment
i
imagined
he
was
about
to
speak
of
the
due
when
he
suddenly
reverted
to
what
he
had
been
saying
and
never
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
subject
madame
bonaparte
replied
to
me
napoleon
has
spoken
the
truth
respecting
moreau
he
was
grossly
deceived
by
those
who
believed
they
could
best
pay
their
court
to
him
by
calumniating
that
general
his
silence
on
the
subject
of
the
due
does
not
surprise
me
he
says
as
little
respecting
it
as
possible
and
always
in
a
vague
manner
and
with
manifest
repugnance
when
you
see
bonaparte
again
be
silent
on
the
subject
and
should
chance
bring
it
forward
avoid
every
expression
in
the
smallest
degree
indicative
of
reproach
he
would
not
suffer
it
you
would
ruin
yourself
for
ever
in
his
estimation
and
the
evil
is
alas
without
remedy
when
you
came
to
malmaison
i
told
you
that
i
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
turn
him
from
his
fatal
purpose
and
how
he
had
treated
me
since
then
he
has
experienced
but
little
internal
satisfaction
it
is
only
in
the
presence
of
his
courtiers
that
he
affects
a
calm
and
tranquil
deportment
but
i
perceive
his
sufferings
are
the
greater
from
thus
endeavouring
to
conceal
them
by
the
by
i
forgot
to
mention
that
he
knew
of
the
visit
you
paid
me
on
the
day
after
the
catastrophe
i
dreaded
that
your
enemies
the
greater
number
of
whom
are
also
mine
might
have
misrepresented
that
interview
but
fortunately
he
paid
little
attention
to
it
he
merely
said
you
have
seen
bourrienne
does
he
sulk
at
me
nevertheless
i
must
do
something
for
him
he
has
again
spoken
in
the
same
strain
and
repeated
nearly
the
same
expressions
three
days
ago
and
since
he
has
commanded
your
presence
i
have
not
a
doubt
but
he
has
something
in
view
for
your
advantage
may
i
presume
to
inquire
what
it
is
i
do
not
yet
know
but
i
would
recommend
to
you
in
the
meantime
to
be
more
strictly
on
your
guard
than
ever
he
is
so
suspicious
and
so
well
informed
of
all
that
is
done
or
said
respecting
himself
i
have
suffered
so
much
since
i
last
saw
you
never
can
i
forget
the
unkind
manner
in
which
he
rejected
my
entreaties
for
several
days
i
laboured
under
a
depression
of
spirits
which
greatly
irritated
him
because
he
clearly
saw
whence
it
proceeded
i
am
not
dazzled
by
the
title
of
empress
i
dread
some
evil
will
result
from
this
step
to
him
to
my
children
and
to
myself
the
miscreants
ought
to
be
satisfied
see
to
what
they
have
driven
us
this
death
embitters
every
moment
of
my
life
i
need
not
say
to
you
bourrienne
that
i
speak
this
in
confidence
you
can
not
doubt
my
prudence
no
certainly
not
bourrienne
i
do
not
doubt
it
my
confidence
in
you
is
unbounded
rest
assured
that
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
me
under
various
circumstances
and
the
devotedness
you
evinced
to
me
on
your
return
from
adieu
my
friend
let
me
see
you

and
afterwards
attended
the

in

all
that

first
who
heard
of
this
protest
immediately
communicated
the
circumstance
to
the
emperor
observing
that
doubtless
the
copies
would
be
multiplied
and
distributed
amongst
the
enemies
of
his
government
in
the
faubourg
germain
which
might
produce
the
worst
effects
and
that
he
therefore
deemed
it
his
duty
to
inform
him
that
orders
might
be
given
to
regnier
and
real
to
keep
a
strict
watch
over
those
engaged
in
distributing
this
document
you
may
judge
of
my
surprise
added
fouche
you
who
know
so
well
that
formerly
the
very
mention
of
the
bourbons
rendered
bonaparte
furious
when
after
perusing
the
protest
he
returned
it
to
me
saying
ah
so
the
comte
de
lille
makes
his
protest
well
well
all
in
good
time
i
hold
my
right
by
the
voice
of
the
french
nation
and
while
i
wear
a
sword
i
will
maintain
it
the
bourbons
ought
to
know
that
i
do
not
fear
them
let
them
therefore
leave
me
in
tranquillity
did
you
say
that
the
fools
of
the
faubourg
germain
would
multiply
the
copies
of
this
protest
of
comte
de
lille
well
they
shall
read
it
at
their
ease
send
it
to
the
moniteur
fouche
and
let
it
be
inserted
morning
this
passed
on
the
of
june
and
the
next
day
the
protest
of
louis
xviii
did
actually
appear
in
that
paper
fouche
was
wholly
indifferent
respecting
the
circulation
of
this
protest
he
merely
wished
to
show
the
emperor
that
he
was
better
informed
of
passing
events
than
regnier
and
to
afford
napoleon
another
proof
of
the
inexperience
and
inability
of
the
grand
judge
in
police
and
fouche
was
not
long
in
receiving
the
reward
which
he
expected
from
this
step
in
fact
ten
days
after
the
publication
of
the
protest
the
emperor
announced
to
regnier
the
of
the
ministry
of
general
police
the
formula
i
pray
god
to
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
with
which
the
letter
to
regnier
closed
was
another
step
of
napoleon
in
the
knowledge
of
ancient
usages
with
which
he
was
not
sufficiently
familiar
when
he
wrote
cambaceres
on
the
day
succeeding
his
elevation
to
the
imperial
throne
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
formula
assorted
awkwardly
with
the
month
of
messidor
and
the
twelfth
year
of
the
republic
the
errors
which
regnier
had
committed
in
the
affair
of
georges
were
the
cause
which
determined
bonaparte
to
the
ministry
of
police
and
to
bestow
it
on
a
man
who
had
created
a
belief
in
the
necessity
of
that
measure
by
a
monstrous
accumulation
of
plots
and
intrigues
i
am
also
certain
that
the
emperor
was
swayed
by
the
probability
of
a
war
breaking
out
which
would
force
him
to
leave
france
and
that
he
considered
fouche
as
the
most
proper
person
to
maintain
the
public
tranquillity
during
his
absence
and
detect
any
cabala
that
might
be
formed
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
at
this
period
when
bonaparte
had
given
the
finishing
blow
to
the
republic
which
had
only
been
a
shadow
since
the
brumaire
it
was
not
difficult
to
foresee
that
the
bourbons
would
one
day
remount
the
throne
of
their
ancestors
and
this
presentiment
was
not
perhaps
without
its
influence
in
rendering
the
majority
greater
in
favour
of
the
foundation
of
the
empire
than
for
the
establishment
of
a
consulate
for
life
the
reestablishment
of
the
throne
was
a
most
important
step
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
for
that
was
the
thing
most
difficult
to
be
done
but
bonaparte
undertook
the
task
and
as
if
by
the
aid
of
a
magic
rod
the
ancient
order
of
things
was
restored
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
distinctions
of
rank
orders
titles
the
noblesse
decorations
all
the
baubles
of
vanity
in
short
all
the
burlesque
tattooing
which
the
vulgar
regard
as
an
indispensable
attribute
of
royalty
reappeared
in
an
instant
the
question
no
longer
regarded
the
form
of
government
but
the
individual
who
should
be
placed
at
its
head
by
restoring
the
ancient
order
of
things
the
republicans
had
themselves
decided
the
question
and
it
could
no
longer
be
doubted
that
when
an
occasion
presented
itself
the
majority
of
the
nation
would
prefer
the
ancient
royal
family
to
whom
france
owed
her
civilisation
her
greatness
and
her
power
and
who
had
exalted
her
to
such
a
high
degree
of
glory
and
prosperity
it
was
not
one
of
the
least
singular
traits
in
napoleon
character
that
during
the
first
year
of
his
reign
he
retained
the
fete
of
the
of
july
it
was
not
indeed
strictly
a
republican
fate
but
it
recalled
the
recollection
of
two
great
popular
triumphs
the
taking
of
the
bastille
and
the
first
federation
this
year
the
of
july
fell
on
a
saturday
and
the
emperor
ordered
its
celebration
to
be
delayed
till
the
following
day
because
it
was
sunday
which
was
in
conformity
with
the
sentiments
he
delivered
respecting
the
concordat
what
renders
me
he
said
most
hostile
to
the
of
the
catholic
worship
is
the
number
of
festivals
formerly
observed
a
saint
day
is
a
day
of
indolence
and
i
wish
not
for
that
the
people
must
labour
in
order
to
live
i
consent
to
four
holidays
in
the
year
but
no
more
if
the
gentlemen
from
rome
are
not
satisfied
with
this
they
may
take
their
departure
the
loss
of
time
seemed
to
him
so
great
a
calamity
that
he
seldom
failed
to
order
an
indispensable
solemnity
to
be
held
on
the
succeeding
holiday
thus
he
postponed
the
corpus
christi
to
the
following
sunday
on
sunday
the
of
july
the
emperor
appeared
for
the
first
time
before
the
parisians
surrounded
by
all
the
pomp
of
royalty
the
members
of
the
legion
of
honour
then
in
paris
took
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
new
constitution
and
on
this
occasion
the
emperor
and
empress
appeared
attended
for
the
first
time
by
a
separate
and
numerous
retinue
the
carriages
in
the
train
of
the
empress
crossed
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
hitherto
exclusively
appropriated
to
the
public
then
followed
the
cavalcade
of
the
emperor
who
appeared
on
horseback
surrounded
by
his
principal
generals
whom
he
had
created
marshals
of
the
empire
de
segur
who
held
the
office
of
grand
master
of
ceremonies
had
the
direction
of
the
ceremonial
to
be
observed
on
this
occasion
and
with
the
governor
received
the
emperor
on
the
threshold
of
the
hotel
des
invalides
they
conducted
the
empress
to
a
tribune
prepared
for
her
reception
opposite
the
imperial
throne
which
napoleon
alone
occupied
to
the
right
of
the
altar
i
was
present
at
this
ceremony
notwithstanding
the
repugnance
i
have
to
such
brilliant
exhibitions
but
as
duroc
had
two
days
before
presented
me
with
tickets
i
deemed
it
prudent
to
attend
on
the
occasion
lest
the
keen
eye
of
bonaparte
should
have
remarked
my
absence
if
duroc
had
acted
by
his
order
i
spent
about
an
hour
contemplating
the
proud
and
sometimes
almost
ludicrous
demeanour
of
the
new
grandees
of
the
empire
i
marked
the
manoeuvring
of
the
clergy
who
with
cardinal
belloy
at
their
head
proceeded
to
receive
the
emperor
on
his
entrance
into
the
church
what
a
singular
train
of
ideas
was
called
up
to
my
mind
when
i
beheld
my
former
comrade
at
the
school
of
brienne
seated
upon
an
elevated
throne
surrounded
by
his
brilliant
staff
the
great
dignitaries
of
his
empire
his
ministers
and
marshals
i
involuntarily
recurred
to
the
brumaire
and
all
this
splendid
scene
vanished
when
i
thought
of
bonaparte
stammering
to
such
a
degree
that
i
was
obliged
to
pull
the
skirt
of
his
coat
to
induce
him
to
withdraw
it
was
neither
a
feeling
of
animosity
nor
of
jealousy
which
called
up
such
reflections
at
no
period
of
our
career
would
i
have
exchanged
my
situation
for
his
but
whoever
can
reflect
whoever
has
witnessed
the
unexpected
elevation
of
a
former
equal
may
perhaps
be
able
to
conceive
the
strange
thoughts
that
assailed
my
mind
for
the
first
time
on
this
occasion
when
the
religious
part
of
the
ceremony
terminated
the
church
assumed
in
some
measure
the
appearance
of
a
profane
temple
the
congregation
displayed
more
devotion
to
the
emperor
than
towards
the
god
of
the
christians
more
enthusiasm
than
fervour
the
mass
had
been
heard
with
little
attention
but
when
de
lacepede
grand
chancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour
after
pronouncing
a
flattering
discourse
finished
the
call
of
the
grand
officers
of
the
legion
bonaparte
covered
as
did
the
ancient
kings
of
france
when
they
held
a
bed
of
justice
a
profound
silence
a
sort
of
religious
awe
then
reigned
throughout
the
assembly
and
napoleon
who
did
not
now
stammer
as
in
the
council
of
the
five
hundred
said
in
a
firm
voice
commanders
officers
legionaries
citizens
soldiers
swear
upon
your
honour
to
devote
yourselves
to
the
service
of
the
empire
to
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
french
territory
to
the
defence
of
the
emperor
of
the
laws
of
the
republic
and
of
the
property
which
they
have
made
sacred
to
combat
by
all
the
means
which
justice
reason
and
the
laws
authorise
every
attempt
to
reestablish
the
feudal
system
in
short
swear
to
concur
with
all
your
might
in
maintaining
liberty
and
equality
which
are
the
bases
of
all
our
institutions
do
you
swear
each
member
of
the
legion
of
honour
exclaimed
i
swear
adding
vive
with
an
enthusiam
it
is
impossible
to
describe
and
in
which
all
present
joined
what
after
all
was
this
new
oath
it
only
differed
from
that
taken
by
the
legion
of
honour
under
the
consulate
in
putting
the
defence
of
the
emperor
before
that
of
the
laws
of
the
republic
and
this
was
not
merely
a
form
it
was
besides
sufficiently
laughable
and
somewhat
audacious
to
make
them
swear
to
support
equality
at
the
moment
so
many
titles
and
monarchical
distinctions
had
been
on
the
of
july
three
days
after
this
ceremony
the
emperor
left
paris
to
visit
the
camp
at
boulogne
he
was
not
accompanied
by
the
empress
on
this
journey
which
was
merely
to
examine
the
progress
of
the
military
operations
availing
myself
of
the
invitation
josephine
had
given
me
i
presented
myself
at
st
cloud
a
few
days
after
the
departure
of
napoleon
as
she
did
not
expect
my
visit
i
found
her
surrounded
by
four
or
five
of
the
ladies
in
waiting
occupied
in
examining
some
of
the
elegant
productions
of
the
famous
leroi
and
madame
despeaux
for
amidst
the
host
of
painful
feelings
experienced
by
josephine
she
was
too
much
of
a
woman
not
to
devote
some
attention
to
the
toilet
on
my
introduction
they
were
discussing
the
serious
question
of
the
costume
to
be
worn
by
the
empress
on
her
journey
to
belgium
to
meet
napoleon
at
the
palace
of
lacken
near
brussels
notwithstanding
those
discussions
respecting
the
form
of
hats
the
colour
and
shape
of
dresses
josephine
received
me
in
her
usual
gracious
manner
but
not
being
able
to
converse
with
me
she
said
without
giving
it
an
appearance
of
invitation
but
in
a
manner
sufficiently
evident
to
be
understood
that
she
intended
to
pass
the
following
morning
at
malmaison
i
shortened
my
visit
and
at
noon
next
day
repaired
to
that
delightful
abode
which
always
created
in
my
mind
deep
emotion
not
an
alley
not
a
grove
but
teemed
with
interesting
recollections
all
recalled
to
me
the
period
when
i
was
the
confidant
of
bonaparte
but
the
time
was
past
when
he
minutely
calculated
how
much
a
residence
at
malmaison
would
cost
and
concluded
by
saying
that
an
income
of
livrea
would
be
necessary
when
i
arrived
madame
bonaparte
was
in
the
garden
with
madame
de
remusat
who
was
her
favourite
from
the
similarity
of
disposition
which
existed
between
them
madame
de
remusat
was
the
daughter
of
the
minister
vergennes
and
sister
to
madame
de
nansouty
whom
i
had
sometimes
seen
with
josephine
but
not
so
frequently
as
her
elder
sister
i
found
the
ladies
in
the
avenue
which
leads
to
ruel
and
saluted
josephine
by
inquiring
respecting
the
health
of
her
majesty
never
can
i
forget
the
tone
in
which
she
replied
ah
bourrienne
i
entreat
that
you
will
suffer
me
at
least
here
to
forget
that
i
am
an
empress
as
she
had
not
a
thought
concealed
from
madame
de
remusat
except
some
domestic
vexations
of
which
probably
i
was
the
only
confidant
we
conversed
with
the
same
freedom
as
if
alone
and
it
is
easy
to
define
that
the
subject
of
our
discourse
regarded
bonaparte
after
having
spoken
of
her
intended
journey
to
belgium
josephine
said
tome
what
a
pity
bourrienne
that
the
past
can
not
be
recalled
he
departed
in
the
happiest
disposition
he
has
bestowed
some
pardons
and
i
am
satisfied
that
but
for
those
accursed
politics
he
would
have
pardoned
a
far
greater
number
i
would
have
said
much
more
but
i
endeavoured
to
conceal
my
chagrin
because
the
slightest
contradiction
only
renders
him
the
more
obstinate
now
when
in
the
midst
of
his
army
he
will
forget
everything
how
much
have
i
been
afflicted
that
i
was
not
able
to
obtain
a
favourable
answer
to
all
the
petitions
which
were
addressed
to
me
that
good
madame
de
monteason
came
from
romainville
to
st
cloud
to
solicit
the
pardon
of
mm
de
riviere
and
de
polignac
we
succeeded
in
gaining
an
audience
for
madame
de
polignac
how
beautiful
she
is
bonaparte
was
greatly
affected
on
beholding
her
he
said
to
her
since
it
was
only
my
life
your
husband
menaced
i
may
pardon
him
you
know
napoleon
bourrienne
you
know
that
he
is
not
naturally
cruel
it
is
his
counsellors
and
flatterers
who
have
induced
him
to
commit
so
many
villainous
actions
rapp
has
behaved
extremely
well
he
went
to
the
emperor
and
would
not
leave
him
till
he
had
obtained
the
pardon
of
another
of
the
condemned
whose
name
i
do
not
recollect
how
much
these
polignacs
have
interested
me
there
will
be
then
at
least
some
families
who
will
owe
him
gratitude
strive
if
it
be
possible
to
throw
a
veil
over
the
past
i
am
sufficiently
miserable
in
my
anticipations
of
the
future
rest
assured
my
dear
bourrienne
that
i
shall
not
fail
to
exert
myself
during
our
stay
in
belgium
in
your
behalf
and
inform
you
of
the
result
adieu
during
the
festival
in
celebration
of
the
of
july
which
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
emperor
before
leaving
the
hotel
des
invalides
had
announced
that
he
would
go
in
person
to
distribute
the
decorations
of
the
legion
of
honour
to
the
army
assembled
in
the
camp
of
boulogne
he
was
not
long
before
he
fulfilled
his
promise
he
left
st
cloud
on
the
and
travelled
with
such
rapidity
that
the
next
morning
whilst
every
one
was
busy
with
preparations
for
his
reception
he
was
already
at
that
port
in
the
midst
of
the
labourers
examining
the
works
he
seemed
to
multiply
himself
by
his
inconceivable
activity
and
one
might
say
that
he
was
present
everywhere
at
the
emperor
departure
it
was
generally
believed
at
paris
that
the
distribution
of
the
crosses
at
the
camp
of
boulogne
was
only
a
pretext
and
that
bonaparte
had
at
length
gone
to
carry
into
execution
the
project
of
an
invasion
of
england
which
every
body
supposed
he
contemplated
it
was
indeed
a
pretext
the
emperor
wished
to
excite
more
and
more
the
enthusiasm
of
the
army
to
show
himself
to
the
military
invested
in
his
new
dignity
to
be
present
at
some
grand
manoeuvres
and
dispose
the
army
to
obey
the
first
signal
he
might
give
how
indeed
on
beholding
such
great
preparations
so
many
transports
created
as
it
were
by
enchantment
could
any
one
have
supposed
that
be
did
not
really
intend
to
attempt
a
descent
on
england
people
almost
fancied
him
already
in
london
it
was
known
that
all
the
army
corps
echelloned
on
the
coast
from
maples
to
ostend
were
ready
to
embark
napoleon
arrival
in
the
midst
of
his
troops
inspired
them
if
possible
with
a
new
impulse
the
french
ports
on
the
channel
had
for
a
long
period
been
converted
into
dockyards
and
arsenals
where
works
were
carried
on
with
that
inconceivable
activity
which
napoleon
knew
so
well
how
to
inspire
an
almost
incredible
degree
of
emulation
prevailed
amongst
the
commanders
of
the
different
camps
and
it
descended
from
rank
to
rank
to
the
common
soldiers
and
even
to
the
labourers
as
every
one
was
eager
to
take
advantage
of
the
slightest
effects
of
chance
and
exercised
his
ingenuity
in
converting
them
into
prognostics
of
good
fortune
for
the
emperor
those
who
had
access
to
him
did
not
fail
to
call
his
attention
to
some
remains
of
a
roman
camp
which
had
been
discovered
at
the
tour
where
the
emperor
tent
was
pitched
this
was
considered
an
evident
proof
that
the
french
caesar
occupied
the
camp
which
the
roman
caesar
had
formerly
constructed
to
menace
great
britain
to
give
additional
force
to
this
allusion
the
tour
resumed
the
name
of
caesar
tower
some
medals
of
william
the
conqueror
found
in
another
spot
where
perhaps
they
had
been
buried
for
the
purpose
of
being
dug
up
could
not
fail
to
satisfy
the
most
incredulous
that
napoleon
must
conquer
england
it
was
not
far
from
caesar
tower
that
men
of
the
camps
of
boulogne
and
montreuil
under
the
command
of
marshal
soult
were
assembled
in
a
vast
plain
to
witness
the
distribution
of
the
crosses
of
the
legion
of
honour
impressed
with
the
imperial
effigy
this
plain
which
i
saw
with
bonaparte
in
our
first
journey
to
the
coast
before
our
departure
to
egypt
was
circular
and
hollow
and
in
the
centre
was
a
little
hill
this
hill
formed
the
imperial
throne
of
bonaparte
in
the
midst
of
his
soldiers
there
he
stationed
himself
with
his
staff
and
around
this
centre
of
glory
the
regiments
were
drawn
up
in
lines
and
looked
like
so
many
diverging
rays
from
this
throne
which
had
been
erected
by
the
hand
of
nature
bonaparte
delivered
in
a
loud
voice
the
same
form
of
oath
which
he
had
pronounced
at
the
hotel
des
invalides
a
few
days
before
it
was
the
signal
for
a
general
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
rapp
alluding
to
this
ceremony
told
me
that
he
never
saw
the
emperor
appear
more
pleased
how
could
he
be
otherwise
fortune
then
seemed
obedient
to
his
wishes
a
storm
came
on
during
this
brilliant
day
and
it
was
apprehended
that
part
of
the
flotilla
would
have
suffered
bonaparte
quitted
the
hill
from
which
he
had
distributed
the
crosses
and
proceeded
to
the
port
to
direct
what
measures
should
be
taken
when
upon
his
arrival
the
storm
the
following
description
of
the
incident
when
napoleon
nearly
occasioned
the
destruction
of
the
boulogne
flotilla
was
forwarded
to
the
politique
et
litteraire
from
a
private
memoir
the
writer
who
was
an
says
one
morning
when
the
emperor
was
mounting
his
horse
he
announced
that
he
intended
to
hold
a
review
of
his
naval
forces
and
gave
the
order
that
the
vessels
which
lay
in
the
harbour
should
alter
their
positions
as
the
review
was
to
be
held
on
the
open
sea
he
started
on
his
usual
ride
giving
orders
that
everything
should
be
arranged
on
his
return
the
time
of
which
be
indicted
his
wish
was
communicated
to
admiral
bruix
who
responded
with
imperturbable
coolness
that
he
was
very
sorry
but
that
the
review
could
not
take
place
that
day
consequently
not
a
vessel
was
moved
on
his
return
back
from
his
ride
the
emperor
asked
whether
all
was
ready
he
was
told
what
the
admiral
had
said
twice
the
answer
had
to
be
repeated
to
him
before
he
could
realise
its
nature
and
then
violently
stamping
his
foot
on
the
ground
he
sent
for
the
admiral
the
emperor
met
him
halfway
with
eyes
burning
with
rage
he
exclaimed
in
an
excited
voice
why
have
my
orders
not
been
executed
with
respectful
firmness
admiral
bruix
replied
sire
a
terrible
storm
is
brewing
your
majesty
may
convince
yourself
of
it
would
you
without
need
expose
the
lives
of
so
many
men
the
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
sound
of
thunder
in
the
distance
more
than
justified
the
fears
of
the
admiral
sir
said
the
emperor
getting
more
and
more
irritated
i
have
given
the
orders
once
more
why
have
they
not
been
executed
the
consequences
concern
me
alone
obey
i
will
not
obey
replied
the
admiral
you
are
insolent
and
the
emperor
who
still
held
his
in
his
hand
advanced
towards
the
admiral
with
a
threatening
gesture
admiral
bruix
stepped
back
and
put
his
hand
on
the
sheath
of
his
sword
and
said
growing
very
pale
sire
take
care
the
whole
suite
stood
paralysed
with
fear
the
emperor
remained
motionless
for
some
time
his
hand
lifted
up
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
admiral
who
still
retained
his
menacing
attitude
at
last
the
emperor
threw
his
whip
on
the
floor
bruix
took
his
hand
off
his
sword
and
with
uncovered
head
awaited
in
silence
the
result
of
the
painful
scene
magon
was
then
ordered
to
see
that
the
emperor
orders
were
instantly
executed
as
for
you
sir
said
the
emperor
fixing
his
eyes
on
admiral
bruix
you
leave
boulogne
within
hours
and
depart
for
holland
go
magon
ordered
the
fatal
movement
of
the
fleet
on
which
the
emperor
had
insisted
the
first
arrangements
had
scarcely
been
made
when
the
sea
because
very
high
the
black
sky
was
pierced
by
lightning
the
thunder
rolled
and
every
moment
the
line
of
vessels
was
broken
by
the
wind
and
shortly
after
that
which
the
admiral
had
foreseen
came
to
pass
and
the
most
frightful
storm
dispersed
the
vessels
in
each
a
way
that
it
seamed
impossible
to
save
them
with
bent
head
arms
crossed
and
a
sorrowful
look
in
his
face
the
emperor
walked
up
and
down
on
the
beach
when
suddenly
the
most
terrible
cries
were
heard
more
than
twenty
gunboats
filled
with
soldiers
and
sailors
were
being
driven
towards
the
shore
and
the
unfortunate
men
were
vainly
fighting
against
the
furious
waves
calling
for
help
which
nobody
could
give
them
deeply
touched
by
the
spectacle
and
the
cries
and
lamentations
of
the
multitude
which
had
assembled
on
the
beach
the
emperor
seeing
his
generals
and
officers
tremble
with
horror
attempted
to
set
an
example
of
devotion
and
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
keep
him
back
he
threw
himself
into
a
boat
saying
let
me
go
let
me
go
they
must
be
brought
out
of
this
in
a
moment
the
boat
was
filled
with
water
the
waves
poured
over
it
again
and
again
and
the
emperor
was
drenched
one
wave
larger
than
the
others
almost
threw
him
overboard
and
his
hat
was
carried
sway
inspired
by
so
much
courage
officers
soldiers
seamen
and
citizens
tried
to
succour
the
drowning
some
in
boats
some
swimming
but
alas
only
a
small
number
could
be
saved
of
the
unfortunate
men
the
following
day
more
than
bodies
were
thrown
ashore
and
with
them
the
hat
of
the
conqueror
of
marengo
that
sad
day
was
one
of
desolation
for
boulogne
and
for
the
camp
the
emperor
groaned
under
the
burden
of
an
accident
which
he
had
to
attribute
solely
to
his
own
obstinacy
agents
were
despatched
to
all
parts
of
the
town
to
subdue
with
gold
the
murmurs
which
ware
ready
to
break
out
into
a
tumult
ceased
as
if
by
enchantment
the
flotilla
entered
the
port
safe
and
sound
and
he
went
back
to
the
camp
where
the
sports
and
amusements
prepared
for
the
soldiers
commenced
and
in
the
evening
the
brilliant
fireworks
which
were
let
off
rose
in
a
luminous
column
which
was
distinctly
seen
from
the
english
it
appears
that
napoleon
was
so
well
able
to
cover
up
this
fiasco
that
not
even
bourrienne
ever
heard
the
true
story
when
he
reviewed
the
troops
he
asked
the
officers
and
often
the
soldiers
in
what
battles
they
had
been
engaged
and
to
those
who
had
received
serious
wounds
he
gave
the
cross
here
i
think
i
may
appropriately
mention
a
singular
piece
of
charlatanism
to
which
the
emperor
had
recourse
and
which
powerfully
contributed
to
augment
the
enthusiasm
of
his
troops
he
would
say
to
one
of
his
aides
decamp
ascertain
from
the
colonel
of
such
a
regiment
whether
he
has
in
his
corps
a
man
who
has
served
in
the
campaigns
of
italy
or
the
campaigns
of
egypt
ascertain
his
name
where
he
was
born
the
particulars
of
his
family
and
what
he
has
done
learn
his
number
in
the
ranks
and
to
what
company
he
belongs
and
furnish
me
with
the
information
on
the
day
of
the
review
bonaparte
at
a
single
glance
could
perceive
the
man
who
had
been
described
to
him
he
would
go
up
to
him
as
if
he
recognised
him
address
him
by
his
name
and
say
oh
so
you
are
here
you
area
brave
fellow
i
saw
you
at
aboukir
how
is
your
old
father
what
have
you
not
got
the
cross
stay
i
will
give
it
you
then
the
delighted
soldiers
would
say
to
each
other
you
see
the
emperor
knows
us
all
he
knows
our
families
he
knows
where
we
have
served
what
a
stimulus
was
this
to
soldiers
whom
he
succeeded
in
persuading
that
they
would
all
some
time
or
other
become
marshals
of
the
empire
lauriston
told
me
amongst
other
anecdotes
relating
to
napoleon
sojourn
at
the
camp
at
boulogne
a
remarkable
instance
of
intrepidity
on
the
part
of
two
english
sailors
these
men
had
been
prisoners
at
verdun
which
was
the
most
considerable
depot
of
english
prisoners
in
france
at
the
rupture
of
the
peace
of
amiens
they
effected
their
escape
from
verdun
and
arrived
at
boulogne
without
having
been
discovered
on
the
road
notwithstanding
the
vigilance
with
which
all
the
english
were
watched
they
remained
at
boulogne
for
some
time
destitute
of
money
and
without
being
able
to
effect
their
escape
they
had
no
hope
of
getting
aboard
a
boat
on
account
of
the
strict
watch
that
was
kept
upon
vessels
of
every
kind
these
two
sailors
made
a
boat
of
little
pieces
of
wood
which
they
put
together
as
well
as
they
could
having
no
other
tools
than
their
knives
they
covered
it
with
a
piece
of
it
was
only
three
or
four
feet
wide
and
not
much
longer
and
was
so
light
that
a
man
could
easily
carry
it
on
his
shoulders
so
powerful
a
passion
is
the
love
of
home
and
liberty
sure
of
being
shot
if
they
were
discovered
almost
equally
sure
of
being
drowned
if
they
effected
their
escape
they
nevertheless
resolved
to
attempt
crossing
the
channel
in
their
fragile
skiff
perceiving
an
english
frigate
within
sight
of
the
coast
they
pushed
off
and
endeavoured
to
reach
her
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
toises
from
the
shore
when
they
were
perceived
by
the
officers
who
set
out
in
pursuit
of
them
and
brought
them
back
again
the
news
of
this
adventure
spread
through
the
camp
where
the
extraordinary
courage
of
the
two
sailors
was
the
subject
of
general
remark
the
circumstance
reached
the
emperor
ears
he
wished
to
see
the
men
and
they
were
conducted
to
his
presence
along
with
their
little
boat
napoleon
whose
imagination
was
struck
by
everything
extraordinary
could
not
conceal
his
surprise
at
so
bold
a
project
undertaken
with
such
feeble
means
of
execution
is
it
really
true
said
the
emperor
to
them
that
you
thought
of
crossing
the
sea
in
this
sire
said
they
if
you
doubt
it
give
us
leave
to
go
and
you
shall
see
us
depart
i
will
you
are
bold
and
enterprising
men
i
admire
courage
wherever
i
meet
it
but
you
shall
not
hazard
your
lives
you
are
at
liberty
and
more
than
that
i
will
cause
you
to
be
put
on
board
an
english
ship
when
you
return
to
london
tell
how
i
esteem
brave
men
even
when
they
are
my
enemies
rapp
who
with
lauriaton
duroc
and
many
others
were
present
at
this
scene
were
not
a
little
astonished
at
the
emperor
generosity
if
the
men
had
not
been
brought
before
him
they
would
have
been
shot
as
spies
instead
of
which
they
obtained
their
liberty
and
napoleon
gave
several
pieces
of
gold
to
each
this
circumstance
was
one
of
those
which
made
the
strongest
impression
on
napoleon
and
he
recollected
it
when
at
helena
in
one
of
his
conversations
with
de
las
casas
no
man
was
ever
so
fond
of
contrasts
as
bonaparte
he
liked
above
everything
to
direct
the
affairs
of
war
whilst
seated
in
his
easy
chair
in
the
cabinet
of
st
cloud
and
to
dictate
in
the
camp
his
decrees
relative
to
civil
administration
thus
at
the
camp
of
boulogne
he
founded
the
decennial
premiums
the
first
distribution
of
which
he
intended
should
take
place
five
years
afterwards
on
the
anniversary
of
the
brumaire
which
was
an
innocent
compliment
to
the
date
of
the
foundation
of
the
consular
republic
this
measure
also
seemed
to
promise
to
the
republican
calendar
a
longevity
which
it
did
not
attain
all
these
little
circumstances
passed
unobserved
but
bonaparte
had
so
often
developed
to
me
his
theory
of
the
art
of
deceiving
mankind
that
i
knew
their
true
value
it
was
likewise
at
the
camp
of
boulogne
that
by
a
decree
emanating
from
his
individual
will
he
destroyed
the
noblest
institution
of
the
republic
the
polytechnic
school
by
converting
it
into
a
purely
military
academy
he
knew
that
in
that
sanctuary
of
high
study
a
republican
spirit
was
fostered
and
whilst
i
was
with
him
he
had
often
told
me
it
was
necessary
that
all
schools
colleges
and
establishments
for
public
instruction
should
be
subject
to
military
discipline
i
frequently
endeavoured
to
controvert
this
idea
but
without
success
it
was
arranged
that
josephine
and
the
emperor
should
meet
in
belgium
he
proceeded
thither
from
the
camp
of
boulogne
to
the
astonishment
of
those
who
believed
that
the
moment
for
the
invasion
of
england
had
at
length
arrived
he
joined
the
empress
at
the
palace
of
lacken
which
the
emperor
had
ordered
to
be
repaired
and
newly
furnished
with
great
magnificence
the
emperor
continued
his
journey
by
the
towns
bordering
on
the
rhine
he
stopped
first
in
the
town
of
charlemagne
passed
through
the
three
bishoprics
there
are
two
or
three
little
circumstances
in
connection
with
this
journey
that
seem
worth
inserting
here
mademoiselle
avrillion
was
the
de
chambre
of
josephine
and
was
constantly
about
her
person
from
the
time
of
the
first
consulship
to
the
death
of
the
empress
in
in
all
such
matters
as
we
shall
quote
from
them
her
memoirs
seem
worthy
of
credit
according
to
mademoiselle
the
empress
during
her
stay
at
chapelle
drank
the
waters
with
much
eagerness
and
some
hope
as
the
theatre
there
was
only
supplied
with
some
german
singers
who
were
not
to
josephine
taste
she
had
part
of
a
french
operatic
company
sent
to
her
from
paris
the
amiable
creole
had
always
a
most
royal
disregard
of
expense
when
bonaparte
joined
her
he
renewed
his
old
custom
of
visiting
his
wife
now
and
then
at
her
toilet
and
according
to
mademoiselle
avrillion
he
took
great
interest
in
the
subject
of
her
dressing
she
says
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
thing
for
us
to
see
the
man
whose
head
was
filled
with
such
vast
affairs
enter
into
the
most
minute
details
of
the
female
toilet
and
of
what
dresses
what
robes
and
what
jewels
the
empress
should
wear
on
such
and
such
an
occasion
one
day
he
daubed
her
dress
with
ink
because
be
did
not
like
it
and
wanted
her
to
put
on
another
whenever
he
looked
into
her
wardrobe
he
was
sure
to
throw
everything
this
characteristic
anecdote
perfectly
agrees
with
what
we
have
heard
from
other
persons
when
the
neapolitan
princess
di
was
at
the
tuileries
as
to
bonaparte
sister
caroline
murat
then
queen
of
naples
on
the
grand
occasion
of
the
marriage
with
maria
louisa
the
princess
to
her
astonishment
saw
the
emperor
go
up
to
a
lady
of
the
court
and
address
her
thus
this
is
the
same
gown
you
wore
the
day
before
yesterday
what
the
meaning
of
this
madame
this
is
not
right
madame
josephine
never
gave
him
a
similar
cause
of
complaint
but
even
when
he
was
emperor
she
often
made
him
murmur
at
the
profusion
of
her
expenditure
under
this
head
the
next
anecdote
will
give
some
idea
of
the
quantity
of
dresses
which
she
wore
for
a
day
or
so
and
then
gave
away
to
her
attendants
who
appear
to
have
carried
on
a
very
active
trade
in
them
while
we
were
at
mayence
the
palace
was
literally
besieged
by
jews
who
continually
brought
manufactured
and
other
goods
to
show
to
the
followers
of
the
court
and
we
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
avoid
buying
them
at
last
they
proposed
that
we
should
barter
with
them
and
when
her
majesty
had
given
us
dresses
that
were
far
too
rich
for
us
to
wear
ourselves
we
exchanged
them
with
the
jews
for
piecegoods
the
robes
we
thus
bartered
did
not
long
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
jews
and
there
must
have
been
a
great
demand
for
them
among
the
belles
of
mayence
for
i
remember
a
ball
there
at
which
the
empress
might
have
seen
all
the
ladies
of
a
quadrille
party
dressed
in
her
i
even
saw
german
princesses
wearing
them
memoires
de
mademoiselle
avrillion
on
his
way
cologne
and
coblentz
which
the
emigration
had
rendered
so
famous
and
arrived
at
mayence
where
his
sojourn
was
distinguished
by
the
first
attempt
at
negotiation
with
the
holy
see
in
order
to
induce
the
pope
to
come
to
france
to
crown
the
new
emperor
and
consolidate
his
power
by
supporting
it
with
the
sanction
of
the
church
this
journey
of
napoleon
occupied
three
months
and
he
did
not
return
to
st
cloud
till
october
amongst
the
flattering
addresses
which
the
emperor
received
in
the
course
of
his
journey
i
can
not
pass
over
unnoticed
the
speech
of
de

said

bonaparte
and
then
rested
this
occasioned
comte
louis

who
was
not
yet
attached
to
the
imperial
system
to
remark
that
it
would
have
been
well
had
god
rested
a
little
sooner
during
the
emperor
absence
a
partial
change
took
place
in
the
ministry
de
champagny
succeeded
chaptal
as
minister

himself
by
his
wish
transformed
into
a
warrior
and
placed
in
command
of
a
regiment
of
dragoons
which
was
a
subject
of
laughter
with
a
great
number
of
generals
i
recollect
that
one
day
lannes
speaking
to
me
of
the
circumstance
in
his

england
was
never
so
much
deceived
by
bonaparte
as
during
the
period
of
the
encampment
at
boulogne
the
english
really
believed
that
an
invasion
was
intended
and
the
government
exhausted
itself
in
efforts
for
raising
men
and
money
to
guard
against
the
danger
of
being
taken
by
surprise
such
indeed
is
the
advantage
always
possessed
by
the
assailant
he
can
choose
the
point
on
which
he
thinks
it
most
convenient
to
act
while
the
party
which
stands
on
the
defence
and
is
afraid
of
being
attacked
is
compelled
to
be
prepared
in
every
point
however
napoleon
who
was
then
in
the
full
vigour
of
his
genius
and
activity
had
always
his
eyes
fixed
on
objects
remote
from
those
which
surrounded
him
and
which
seemed
to
absorb
his
whole
attention
thus
during
the
journey
of
which
i
have
spoken
the
ostensible
object
of
which
was
the
organisation
of
the
departments
on
the
rhine
he
despatched
two
squadrons
from
rochefort
and
boulogne
one
commanded
by
missiessy
the
other
by
villeneuve
i
shall
not
enter
into
any
details
about
those
squadrons
i
shall
merely
mention
with
respect
to
them
that
while
the
emperor
was
still
in
belgium
lauriston
paid
me
a
sudden
and
unexpected
visit
he
was
on
his
way
to
toulon
to
take
command
of
the
troops
which
were
to
be
embarked
on
villeneuve
squadron
and
he
was
not
much
pleased
with
the
service
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
lauriston
visit
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
for
me
we
were
always
on
friendly
terms
and
i
received
much
information
from
him
particularly
with
respect
to
the
manner
in
which
the
emperor
spent
his
time
you
can
have
no
idea
said
he
how
much
the
emperor
does
and
the
sort
of
enthusiasm
which
his
presence
excites
in
the
army
but
his
anger
at
the
contractors
is
greater
than
ever
and
he
has
been
very
severe
with
some
of
them
these
words
of
lauriaton
did
not
at
all
surprise
me
for
i
well
knew
napoleon
dislike
to
contractors
and
all
men
who
had
mercantile
transactions
with
the
army
i
have
often
heard
him
say
that
they
were
a
curse
and
a
leprosy
to
nations
that
whatever
power
he
might
attain
he
never
would
grant
honours
to
any
of
them
and
that
of
all
aristocracies
theirs
was
to
him
the
most
insupportable
after
his
accession
to
the
empire
the
contractors
were
no
longer
the
important
persons
they
had
been
under
the
directory
or
even
during
the
two
first
years
of
the
consulate
bonaparte
sometimes
acted
with
them
as
he
had
before
done
with
the
beya
of
egypt
when
he
drew
from
them
forced
contributions
lauriston
one
of
napoleon
aides
de
camp
who
was
with
him
at
the
military
school
of
paris
and
who
had
been
commissioned
in
the
artillery
at
the
same
time
as
napoleon
considered
that
he
should
have
had
the
post
of
grand
ecuyer
which
caulaincourt
had
obtained
he
had
complained
angrily
to
the
emperor
and
after
a
stormy
interview
was
ordered
to
join
the
fleet
of
villeneuve
in
consequence
he
was
at
trafalgar
on
his
return
after
austerlitz
his
temporary
disgrace
was
forgotten
and
he
was
sent
as
governor
to
venice
he
became
marshal
under
the
restoration
i
recollect
another
somewhat
curious
circumstance
respecting
the
visit
of
lauriston
who
had
left
the
emperor
and
empress
at
lauriston
was
the
best
educated
of
the
aides
de
camp
and
napoleon
often
conversed
with
him
on
such
literary
works
as
he
chose
to
notice
he
sent
for
me
one
day
said
lauriston
when
i
was
on
duty
at
the
palace
of
lacken
and
spoke
to
me
of
the
decennial
prizes
and
the
tragedy
of
de
nisas
and
a
novel
by
madame
de
stael
which
he
had
just
read
but
which
i
had
not
seen
and
was
therefore
rather
embarrassed
in
replying
to
him
respecting
madame
de
stael
and
her
delphine
he
said
some
remarkable
things
do
not
like
women
he
observed
make
men
of
themselves
any
more
than
i
like
effeminate
men
there
is
s
proper
part
for
every
one
to
play
in
the
world
what
does
all
this
flight
of
imagination
mean
what
is
the
result
of
it
nothing
it
is
all
sentimental
metaphysics
and
disorder
of
the
mind
i
can
not
endure
that
woman
for
one
reason
that
i
can
not
bear
women
who
make
a
set
at
me
and
god
knows
how
often
she
has
tried
to
cajole
me
the
words
of
lauriston
brought
to
my
recollection
the
conversations
i
had
often
had
with
bonaparte
respecting
madame
de
stael
of
whose
advances
made
to
the
first
consul
and
even
to
the
general
of
the
army
of
italy
i
had
frequently
been
witness
bonaparte
knew
nothing
at
first
of
madame
de
stael
but
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
necker
a
man
for
whom
as
i
have
already
shown
he
had
very
little
esteem
madame
de
stael
had
not
been
introduced
to
him
and
knew
nothing
more
of
him
than
what
fame
had
published
respecting
the
young
conqueror
of
italy
when
she
addressed
to
him
letters
full
of
enthusiasm
bonaparte
read
some
passages
of
them
to
me
and
laughing
said
what
do
you
think
bourrienne
of
these
extravagances
this
woman
is
mad
i
recollect
that
in
one
of
her
letters
madame
de
stael
among
other
things
told
him
that
they
certainly
were
created
for
each
other
that
it
was
in
consequence
of
an
error
in
human
institutions
that
the
quiet
and
gentle
josephine
was
united
to
his
fate
that
nature
seemed
to
have
destined
for
the
adoration
of
a
hero
such
as
he
a
soul
of
fire
like
her
own
these
extravagances
disgusted
bonaparte
to
a
degree
which
i
can
not
describe
when
he
had
finished
reading
these
fine
epistles
he
used
to
throw
them
into
the
fire
or
tear
them
with
marked
and
would
say
well
here
is
a
woman
who
pretends
to
genius
a
maker
of
sentiments
and
she
presumes
to
compare
herself
to
josephine
bourrienne
i
shall
not
reply
to
such
letters
i
had
however
the
opportunity
of
seeing
what
the
perseverance
of
a
woman
of
talent
can
effect
notwithstanding
bonaparte
prejudices
against
madame
de
stael
which
he
never
abandoned
she
succeeded
in
getting
herself
introduced
to
him
and
if
anything
could
have
disgusted
him
with
flattery
it
would
have
been
the
admiration
or
to
speak
more
properly
the
worship
which
she
paid
him
for
she
used
to
compare
him
to
a
god
descended
on
earth
a
kind
of
comparison
which
the
clergy
i
thought
had
reserved
for
their
own
use
but
unfortunately
to
please
madame
de
stael
it
would
have
been
necessary
that
her
god
had
been
plutua
for
behind
her
eulogies
lay
a
claim
for
two
millions
which
necker
considered
still
due
to
him
on
account
of
his
good
and
worthy
services
however
bonaparte
said
on
this
occasion
that
whatever
value
he
might
set
on
the
suffrage
of
madame
de
stael
he
did
not
think
fit
to
pay
so
dear
for
it
with
the
money
of
the
state
the
conversion
of
madame
de
stael
enthusiasm
into
hatred
is
well
known
as
are
also
the
petty
vexations
unworthy
of
himself
with
which
the
emperor
harassed
her
in
her
retreat
at
coppet
lauriston
had
arrived
at
paris
where
he
made
but
a
short
stay
some
days
before
caffarelli
who
was
sent
on
a
mission
to
rome
to
sound
the
papal
court
and
to
induce
the
holy
father
to
come
to
paris
to
consecrate
bonaparte
at
his
coronation
i
have
already
described
the
nature
of
bonaparte
ideas
on
religion
his
notions
on
the
subject
seemed
to
amount
to
a
sort
of
vague
feeling
rather
than
to
any
belief
founded
on
reflection
nevertheless
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
power
of
the
church
but
not
because
he
considered
it
dangerous
to
governments
particularly
to
his
own
napoleon
never
could
have
conceived
how
it
was
possible
that
a
sovereign
wearing
a
crown
and
a
sword
could
have
the
meanness
to
kneel
to
a
pope
or
to
humble
his
sceptre
before
the
keys
of
peter
his
spirit
was
too
great
to
admit
of
such
a
thought
on
the
contrary
he
regarded
the
alliance
between
the
church
and
his
power
as
a
happy
means
of
influencing
the
opinions
of
the
people
and
as
an
additional
tie
which
was
to
attach
them
to
a
government
rendered
legitimate
by
the
solemn
sanction
of
the
papal
authority
bonaparte
was
not
deceived
in
this
as
well
as
in
many
other
things
the
perspicacity
of
his
genius
enabled
him
to
comprehend
all
the
importance
of
a
consecration
bestowed
on
him
by
the
pope
more
especially
as
louis
without
subjects
without
territory
and
wearing
only
an
illusory
crown
had
not
received
that
sacred
unction
by
which
the
descendants
of
hugh
capet
become
the
eldest
sons
of
the
church
as
soon
as
the
emperor
was
informed
of
the
success
of
mission
and
that
the
pope
in
compliance
with
his
desire
was
about
to
repair
to
paris
to
confirm
in
his
hands
the
sceptre
of
charlemagne
nothing
was
thought
of
but
preparations
for
that
great
event
which
had
been
preceded
by
the
recognition
of
napoleon
as
emperor
of
the
french
on
the
part
of
all
the
states
of
europe
with
the
exception
of
england
on
the
conclusion
of
the
concordat
bonaparte
said
to
me
i
shall
let
the
republican
generals
exclaim
as
much
as
they
like
against
the
mass
i
know
what
i
am
about
i
am
working
for
posterity
he
was
now
gathering
the
fruits
of
his
concordat
he
ordered
that
the
pope
should
be
everywhere
treated
in
his
journey
through
the
french
territory
with
the
highest
distinction
and
he
proceeded
to
fontainebleau
to
receive
his
holiness
this
afforded
an
opportunity
for
bonaparte
to
the
example
of
those
journeys
of
the
old
court
during
which
changes
of
ministers
used
formerly
to
be
made
the
palace
of
fontainebleau
now
become
imperial
like
all
the
old
royal
chateaux
had
been
newly
furnished
with
a
luxury
and
taste
corresponding
to
the
progress
of
modern
art
the
emperor
was
proceeding
on
the
road
to
nemours
when
courtiers
informed
him
of
the
approach
of
pius
vii
bonaparte
object
was
to
avoid
the
ceremony
which
had
been
previously
settled
he
had
therefore
made
the
pretext
of
going
on
a
and
was
in
the
way
as
it
were
by
chance
when
the
pope
carriage
was
arriving
he
alighted
from
horseback
and
the
pope
came
out
of
his
carriage
rapp
was
with
the
emperor
and
i
think
i
yet
hear
him
describing
in
his
original
manner
and
with
his
german
accent
this
grand
interview
upon
which
however
he
for
his
part
looked
with
very
little
respect
rapp
in
fact
was
among
the
number
of
those
who
notwithstanding
his
attachment
to
the
emperor
preserved
independence
of
character
and
he
knew
he
had
no
reason
to
dissemble
with
me
fancy
to
yourself
said
he
the
amusing
comedy
that
was
played
after
the
emperor
and
the
pope
had
well
embraced
they
went
into
the
same
carriage
and
in
order
that
they
might
be
upon
a
footing
of
equality
they
were
to
enter
at
the
same
time
by
opposite
doors
all
that
was
settled
but
at
breakfast
the
emperor
had
calculated
how
he
should
manage
without
appearing
to
assume
anything
to
get
on
the
righthand
side
of
the
pope
and
everything
turned
out
as
he
wished
as
to
the
pope
said
rapp
i
must
own
that
i
never
saw
a
man
with
a
finer
countenance
or
more
respectable
appearance
than
pius
vii
after
the
conference
between
the
pope
and
the
emperor
at
fontainebleau
pius
vii
set
off
for
paris
first
on
the
road
the
same
honours
were
paid
to
him
as
to
the
emperor
apartments
were
prepared
for
him
in
the
pavilion
de
flore
in
the
tuileries
and
his
bedchamber
was
arranged
and
furnished
in
the
same
manner
as
his
chamber
in
the
palace
of
cavallo
his
usual
residence
in
rome
the
pope
presence
in
paris
was
so
extraordinary
a
circumstance
that
it
was
scarcely
believed
though
it
had
some
time
before
been
talked
of
what
indeed
could
be
more
singular
than
to
see
the
head
of
the
church
in
a
capital
where
four
years
previously
the
altars
had
been
overturned
and
the
few
faithful
who
remained
had
been
obliged
to
exercise
their
worship
in
secret
the
pope
became
the
object
of
public
respect
and
general
curiosity
i
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
see
him
and
my
wish
was
gratified
on
the
day
when
he
went
to
visit
the
imperial
printing
office
then
situated
where
the
bank
of
france
now
is
a
pamphlet
dedicated
to
the
pope
containing
the
pater
noster
in
one
hundred
and
fifty
different
languages
was
struck
off
in
the
presence
of
his
holiness
during
this
visit
to
the
printing
office
an
young
man
kept
his
hat
on
in
the
pope
presence
several
persons
indignant
at
this
indecorum
advanced
to
take
off
the
young
man
hat
a
little
confusion
arose
and
the
pope
observing
the
cause
of
it
stepped
up
to
the
young
man
and
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
kindness
truly
patriarchal
young
man
uncover
that
i
may
give
thee
my
blessing
an
old
blessing
never
yet
harmed
any
one
this
little
incident
deeply
affected
all
who
witnessed
it
the
countenance
and
figure
of
pope
pius
vii
commanded
respect
david
admirable
portrait
is
a
living
likeness
of
him
the
pope
arrival
at
paris
produced
a
great
sensation
in
london
greater
indeed
there
than
anywhere
else
notwithstanding
the
separation
of
the
english
church
from
the
church
of
rome
the
english
ministry
now
spared
no
endeavours
to
influence
public
opinion
by
the
circulation
of
libels
against
bonaparte
the
cabinet
of
london
found
a
twofold
advantage
in
encouraging
this
system
which
not
merely
excited
irritation
against
the
powerful
enemy
of
england
but
diverted
from
the
british
government
the
clamour
which
some
of
its
measures
were
calculated
to
create
bonaparte
indignation
against
england
was
roused
to
the
utmost
extreme
and
in
truth
this
indignation
was
in
some
degree
a
national
feeling
in
france
napoleon
had
heard
of
the
success
of
caffarelli
negotiations
previous
to
his
return
to
paris
after
his
journey
to
the
rhine
on
arriving
at
st
cloud
he
lost
no
time
in
ordering
the
preparations
for
his
coronation
everything
aided
the
fulfilment
of
his
wishes
on
november
the
pope
arrived
at
paris
and
two
days
after
viz
on
the
of
december
the
senate
presented
to
the
emperor
the
votes
of
the
people
for
the
establishment
of
hereditary
succession
in
his
family
for
as
it
was
pretended
that
the
assumption
of
the
title
of
emperor
was
no
way
prejudicial
to
the
republic
the
question
of
hereditary
succession
only
had
been
proposed
for
public
sanction
sixty
thousand
registers
had
been
opened
in
different
parts
of
france
at
the
offices
of
the
ministers
the
prefects
the
mayors
of
the
communes
notaries
solicitors
etc
france
at
that
time
contained
departments
and
there
were
voters
of
these
only
voted
against
hereditary
succession
bonaparte
ordered
a
list
of
the
persons
who
had
voted
against
the
question
to
be
sent
to
him
and
he
often
consulted
it
they
proved
to
be
not
royalist
but
for
the
most
part
staunch
republicans
to
my
knowledge
many
royalists
abstained
from
voting
at
all
not
wishing
to
commit
themselves
uselessly
and
still
less
to
give
their
suffrages
to
the
author
of
the
duo
death
for
my
part
i
gave
my
vote
in
favour
of
hereditary
succession
in
bonaparte
family
my
situation
as
may
well
be
imagined
did
not
allow
me
to
do
otherwise
since
the
month
of
october
the
legislative
body
had
been
convoked
to
attend
the
emperor
coronation
many
deputies
arrived
and
with
them
a
swarm
of
those
presidents
of
cantons
who
occupied
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
annals
of
ridicule
at
the
close
of
the
year
they
became
the
objects
of
all
sorts
of
witticisms
and
jests
the
obligation
of
wearing
swords
made
their
appearance
very
grotesque
as
many
droll
stories
were
told
of
them
as
were
ten
years
afterwards
related
of
those
who
were
styled
the
voltigeurs
of
louis
xiv
one
of
these
anecdotes
was
so
exceedingly
ludicrous
that
though
it
was
probably
a
mere
invention
yet
i
can
not
refrain
from
relating
it
a
certain
number
of
these
presidents
were
one
day
selected
to
be
presented
to
the
pope
and
as
most
of
them
were
very
poor
they
found
it
necessary
to
combine
economy
with
the
etiquette
necessary
to
be
observed
under
the
new
order
of
things
to
save
the
expense
of
hiring
carriages
they
therefore
proceeded
to
the
pavilion
de
flore
on
foot
taking
the
precaution
of
putting
on
gaiters
to
preserve
their
white
silk
stockings
from
the
mud
which
covered
the
streets
for
it
was
then
the
month
of
december
on
arriving
at
the
tuileries
one
of
the
party
put
his
gaiters
into
his
pocket
it
happened
that
the
pope
delivered
such
an
affecting
address
that
all
present
were
moved
to
tears
and
the
unfortunate
president
who
had
disposed
of
his
gaiters
in
the
way
just
mentioned
drew
them
out
instead
of
his
handkerchief
and
smeared
his
face
over
with
mud
the
pope
is
said
to
have
been
much
amused
at
this
mistake
if
this
anecdote
should
be
thought
too
puerile
to
be
repeated
here
i
may
observe
that
it
afforded
no
small
merriment
to
bonaparte
who
made
michot
the
actor
relate
it
to
the
empress
at
paris
one
evening
after
a
court
performance
napoleon
had
now
attained
the
avowed
object
of
his
ambition
but
his
ambition
receded
before
him
like
a
boundless
horizon
on
the
of
december
the
day
on
which
the
senate
presented
to
the
emperor
the
result
of
the
votes
for
hereditary
succession
francois
de
neufchateau
delivered
an
address
to
him
in
which
there
was
no
want
of
adulatory
expressions
as
president
of
the
senate
he
had
had
some
practice
in
that
style
of
speechmaking
and
he
only
substituted
the
eulogy
of
the
monarchical
government
for
that
of
the
republican
government
sempre
bene
as
the
italians
say
if
i
wished
to
make
comparisons
i
could
here
indulge
in
some
curious
ones
is
it
not
extraordinary
that
fontainebleau
should
have
witnessed
at
the
interval
of
nearly
ten
years
napoleon
first
interview
with
the
pope
and
his
last
farewell
to
his
army
and
that
the
senate
who
had
previously
given
such
ready
support
to
bonaparte
should
in
have
pronounced
his
abdication
at
fontainebleau
the
preparations
for
the
coronation
proved
very
advantageous
to
the
trading
classes
of
paris
great
numbers
of
foreigners
and
people
from
the
provinces
visited
the
capital
and
the
return
of
luxury
and
the
revival
of
old
customs
gave
occupation
to
a
variety
of
tradespeople
who
could
get
no
employment
under
the
directory
or
consulate
such
as
saddlers
lacemen
embroiderers
and
others
by
these
positive
interests
were
created
more
partisans
of
the
empire
than
by
opinion
and
reflection
and
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
trade
had
not
been
so
active
for
a
dozen
years
before
the
imperial
crown
jewels
were
exhibited
to
the
public
at
biennais
the
jeweller
the
crown
was
of
a
light
form
and
with
its
leaves
of
gold
it
less
resembled
the
crown
of
france
than
the
antique
crown
of
the
caesars
these
things
were
afterwards
placed
in
the
public
treasury
together
with
the
imperial
insignia
of
charlemagne
which
bonaparte
had
ordered
to
be
brought
from
but
while
bonaparte
was
thus
priding
himself
in
his
crown
and
his
imagined
resemblance
to
charlemagne
pitt
lately
recalled
to
the
ministry
was
concluding
at
stockholm
a
treaty
with
sweden
and
agreeing
to
pay
a
subsidy
to
that
power
to
enable
it
to
maintain
hostilities
against
france
this
treaty
was
concluded
on
the
of
december
the
day
after
the
coronation
the
details
of
the
preparation
for
the
coronation
caused
many
stormy
scenes
between
napoleon
and
his
family
the
princesses
his
sisters
and
were
especially
shocked
at
having
to
carry
the
train
of
the
imperial
mantle
of
josephine
and
even
when
josephine
was
actually
moving
from
the
altar
to
the
throne
the
princesses
evinced
their
reluctance
so
plainly
that
josephine
could
not
advance
and
an
altercation
took
place
which
had
to
be
stopped
by
napoleon
himself
joseph
was
quite
willing
himself
give
up
appearing
in
a
mantle
with
a
train
but
he
wished
to
prevent
his
wife
bearing
the
mantle
of
the
empress
and
he
opposed
his
brother
on
so
many
points
that
napoleon
ended
by
calling
on
him
to
either
give
up
his
position
and
retire
from
all
politics
or
else
to
fully
accept
the
imperial
regime
how
the
economical
camberceres
used
up
the
ermine
he
could
not
wear
will
be
seen
in
junot
tome
iii
josephine
herself
was
in
the
greatest
anxiety
as
to
whether
the
wish
of
the
bonaparte
family
that
she
should
be
divorced
would
carry
the
day
with
her
husband
when
she
had
gained
her
cause
for
the
time
and
after
the
pope
had
engaged
to
crown
her
she
seems
to
have
most
cleverly
managed
to
get
the
pope
informed
that
she
was
only
united
to
napoleon
by
a
civil
marriage
the
pope
insisted
on
a
religious
marriage
napoleon
was
angry
but
could
not
recede
and
the
religions
rite
was
performed
by
cardinal
fesch
the
day
or
two
days
before
the
coronation
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
was
carefully
guarded
from
napoleon
by
josephine
and
even
placed
beyond
his
reach
at
the
time
of
the
divorce
such
at
least
seems
to
be
the
most
probable
account
of
this
mysterious
and
doubtful
matter
the
fact
that
cardinal
fesch
maintained
that
the
religious
rite
had
been
duly
performed
thirteen
of
the
cardinals
not
however
including
fesch
were
so
convinced
of
the
legality
of
the
marriage
that
they
refused
to
appear
at
the
ceremony
of
marriage
with
marie
louise
thus
drawing
down
the
wrath
of
the
emperor
and
becoming
the
cardinals
noirs
from
being
forbidden
to
wear
their
own
robes
seems
to
leave
no
doubt
that
the
religious
rite
had
been
performed
the
marriage
was
only
pronounced
to
be
invalid
in
by
the
local
canonical
bodies
not
by
the
authority
of
the
pope
it
can
not
be
expected
that
i
should
enter
into
a
detail
of
the
ceremony
which
took
place
on
the
of
december
the
glitter
of
gold
the
waving
plumes
and
horses
of
the
imperial
procession
the
mule
which
preceded
the
pope
cortege
and
occasioned
so
much
merriment
to
the
parisians
have
already
been
described
over
and
over
again
i
may
however
relate
an
anecdote
connected
with
the
coronation
told
me
by
josephine
and
which
is
exceedingly
characteristic
of
napoleon
when
bonaparte
was
paying
his
addresses
to
madame
de
beauharnais
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
kept
a
carriage
and
therefore
bonaparte
frequently
accompanied
her
when
she
walked
out
one
day
they
went
together
to
the
notary
raguideau
one
of
the
shortest
men
i
think
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
madame
de
beauharnais
placed
great
confidence
in
him
and
went
there
on
purpose
to
acquaint
him
of
her
intention
to
marry
the
young
general
of
artillery
the
protege
of
barras
josephine
went
alone
into
the
notary
cabinet
while
bonaparte
waited
for
her
in
an
adjoining
room
the
door
of
raguideau
cabinet
did
not
shut
close
and
bonaparte
plainly
heard
him
dissuading
madame
de
beauharnais
from
her
projected
marriage
you
are
going
to
take
a
very
wrong
step
said
he
and
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
can
you
be
so
mad
as
to
marry
a
young
man
who
has
nothing
but
his
cloak
and
his
sword
bonaparte
josephine
told
me
had
never
mentioned
this
to
her
and
she
never
supposed
that
he
had
heard
what
fell
from
raguideau
only
think
bourrienne
continued
she
what
was
my
astonishment
when
dressed
in
the
imperial
robes
on
the
coronation
day
he
desired
that
raguideau
might
be
sent
for
saying
that
he
wished
to
see
him
immediately
and
when
raguidesu
appeared
he
said
to
him
sir
have
i
nothing
but
my
cloak
and
my
sword
now
though
bonaparte
had
related
to
me
almost
all
the
circumstances
of
his
life
as
they
occurred
to
his
memory
he
never
once
mentioned
this
affair
of
raguideau
which
he
only
seemed
to
have
suddenly
recollected
on
his
coronation
day
the
day
after
the
coronation
all
the
troops
in
paris
were
assembled
in
the
champ
de
mars
the
imperial
eagles
might
be
distributed
to
each
regiment
in
lieu
of
the
national
flags
i
has
stayed
away
from
the
coronation
in
the
church
of
notre
dame
but
i
wished
to
see
the
military
fete
in
the
champ
de
mars
because
i
took
real
pleasure
in
seeing
bonaparte
amongst
his
soldiers
a
throne
was
erected
in
front
of
the
military
school
which
though
now
transformed
into
a
barrack
must
have
recalled
to
bonaparte
mind
some
singular
recollections
of
his
boyhood
at
a
given
signal
all
the
columns
closed
and
approached
the
throne
then
bonaparte
rising
gave
orders
for
the
distribution
of
the
eagles
and
delivered
the
following
address
to
the
deputations
of
the
different
corps
of
the
army
soldiers
soldiers
behold
your
colours
these
eagles
will
always
be
your
they
will
always
be
where
your
emperor
may
thank
them
necessary
for
the
defence
of
his
throne
and
of
his
people
swear
to
sacrifice
your
lives
to
defend
them
and
by
your
courage
to
keep
them
constantly
in
the
path
of
swear
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
acclamations
which
followed
this
address
there
is
something
so
seductive
in
popular
enthusiasm
that
even
indifferent
persons
can
not
help
yielding
to
its
influence
and
yet
the
least
reflection
would
have
shown
how
shamefully
napoleon
forswore
the
declaration
he
made
to
the
senate
when
the
organic
for
the
foundation
of
the
empire
was
presented
to
him
at
st
cloud
on
that
occasion
he
said
the
french
people
shall
never
be
my
people
and
yet
the
day
after
his
coronation
his
eagles
were
to
be
carried
wherever
they
might
be
necessary
for
the
defence
of
his
people
by
a
singular
coincidence
while
on
the
of
december
bonaparte
was
receiving
from
the
head
of
the
church
the
imperial
crown
of
france
louis
who
was
then
at
colmar
prompted
as
it
were
by
an
inexplicable
presentiment
drew
up
and
signed
a
declaration
to
the
french
people
in
which
he
declared
that
he
then
swore
never
to
break
the
sacred
bond
which
united
his
destiny
to
theirs
never
to
renounce
the
inheritance
of
his
ancestors
or
to
relinquish
his
rights

my

an
event

concerns
myself
personally
namely
my
appointment
as
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
dukes
of
brunswick
and
and
to
the
hanse
towns
this
appointment
took
place
on
the
of

josephine
who
had
kindly
promised
to
apprise
me
of
what
the
emperor
intended
to
do
for
me
as
soon
as
she
herself
should
know
his
intentions
sent
a
messenger
to
acquaint
me
with
my
appointment
and
to
tell
me
that
the
emperor
wished
to
see
me
i
had
not
visited
josephine
since
her
departure
for
belgium
the
pompa
and
ceremonies
of
the
coronation
had
i
may
say
dazzled
me
and
deterred
me
from
presenting
myself
at
the
imperial
palace
where
i
should
have
been
annoyed
by
the
etiquette
which
had
been
observed
since
the
coronation
i
can
not
describe
what
a
disagreeable
impression
this
parade
always
produced
on
me
i
could
not
all
at
once
forget
the
time
when
i
used
without
ceremony
to
go
into
bonaparte
chamber
and
wake
him
at
the
appointed
hour
as
to
bonaparte
i
had
not
seen
him
since
he
sent
for
me
after
the
condemnation
of
georges
when
i
saw
that
my
candour
relative
to
moreau
was
not
displeasing
to
him
moreau
had
since
quitted
france
without
napoleon
subjecting
him
to
the
application
of
the
odious
law
which
has
only
been
repealed
since
the
return
of
the
bourbons
and
by
virtue
of
which
he
was
condemned
to
the
confiscation
of
his
property
moreau
sold
his
estate
of
gros
bois
to
bertlier
and
proceeded
to
cadiz
whence
he
embarked
for
america
i
shall
not
again
have
occasion
to
speak
of
him
until
the
period
of
the
intrigues
into
which
he
was
drawn
by
the
same
influence
which
ruined
him
in
france
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
i
received
the
kind
message
from
josephine
i
had
an
official
invitation
to
proceed
the
next
day
to
malmaison
where
the
emperor
then
was
i
was
much
pleased
at
the
idea
of
seeing
him
there
rather
than
at
the
tuileries
or
even
at
st
cloud
our
former
intimacy
at
malmaison
made
me
feel
more
at
my
ease
respecting
an
interview
of
which
my
knowledge
of
bonaparte
character
led
me
to
entertain
some
apprehension
was
i
to
be
received
by
my
old
comrade
of
brienne
or
by
his
imperial
majesty
i
was
received
by
my
old
college
companion
on
my
arrival
at
malmaison
i
was
ushered
into
the
tentroom
leading
to
the
library
how
i
was
astonished
at
the
familiarity
with
which
he
received
me
this
extraordinary
man
displayed
if
i
may
employ
the
term
a
coquetry
towards
me
which
surprised
me
notwithstanding
my
past
knowledge
of
his
character
he
came
up
to
me
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
took
my
hand
which
he
had
never
done
since
he
was
consul
pressed
it
affectionately
and
it
was
impossible
that
i
could
look
upon
him
as
the
emperor
of
france
and
the
future
king
of
italy
yet
i
was
too
well
aware
of
his
fits
of
pride
to
allow
his
familiarity
to
lead
me
beyond
the
bounds
of
affectionate
respect
my
dear
bourrienne
said
he
can
you
suppose
that
the
elevated
rank
i
have
attained
has
altered
my
feelings
towards
you
no
i
do
not
attach
importance
to
the
glitter
of
imperial
pomp
all
that
is
meant
for
the
people
but
i
must
still
be
valued
according
to
my
deserts
i
have
been
very
well
satisfied
with
your
services
and
i
have
appointed
you
to
a
situation
where
i
shall
have
occasion
for
them
i
know
that
i
can
rely
upon
you
he
then
asked
with
great
warmth
of
friendship
what
i
was
about
and
inquired
after
my
family
etc
in
short
i
never
saw
him
display
less
reserve
or
more
familiarity
and
unaffected
simplicity
which
he
did
the
more
readily
perhaps
because
his
greatness
was
now
incontestable
you
know
added
napoleon
that
i
set
out
in
a
week
for
italy
i
shall
make
myself
king
but
that
is
only
a
i
have
greater
designs
respecting
italy
it
must
be
a
kingdom
comprising
all
the
transalpine
states
from
venice
to
the
maritime
alps
the
union
of
italy
with
france
can
only
be
temporary
but
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
accustom
the
nations
of
italy
to
live
under
common
laws
the
genoese
the
piedmontese
the
venetians
the
milanese
the
inhabitants
of
tuscany
the
romans
and
the
neapolitans
hate
each
other
none
of
them
will
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
the
other
and
yet
rome
is
from
the
recollections
connected
with
it
the
natural
capital
of
italy
to
make
it
so
however
it
is
necessary
that
the
power
of
the
pope
should
be
confined
within
limits
purely
spiritual
i
can
not
now
think
of
this
but
i
will
reflect
upon
it
hereafter
at
present
i
have
only
vague
ideas
on
the
subject
but
they
will
be
matured
in
time
and
then
all
depends
on
circumstances
what
was
it
told
me
when
we
were
walking
like
two
idle
fellows
as
we
were
in
the
streets
of
paris
that
i
should
one
day
be
master
of
france
my
wish
merely
a
vague
wish
circumstances
have
done
the
rest
it
is
therefore
wise
to
look
into
the
future
and
that
i
do
with
respect
to
italy
as
it
will
be
impossible
with
one
effort
to
unite
her
so
as
to
form
a
single
power
subject
to
uniform
laws
i
will
begin
by
making
her
french
all
these
little
states
will
insensibly
become
accustomed
to
the
same
laws
and
when
manners
shall
be
assimilated
and
enmities
extinguished
then
there
will
be
an
italy
and
i
will
give
her
independence
but
for
that
i
must
have
twenty
years
and
who
can
count
on
the
future
bourrienne
i
feel
pleasure
in
telling
you
all
this
it
was
locked
up
in
my
mind
with
you
i
think
aloud
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
altered
two
words
of
what
bonaparte
said
to
me
respecting
italy
so
perfect
i
may
now
say
without
vaniy
was
my
memory
then
and
so
confirmed
was
my
habit
of
fixing
in
it
all
that
he
said
to
me
after
having
informed
me
of
his
vague
projects
bonaparte
with
one
of
those
transitions
so
common
to
him
said
by
the
by
bourrienne
i
have
something
to
tell
you
madame
de
brienne
has
begged
that
i
will
pass
through
brienne
and
i
promised
that
i
will
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
i
shall
feel
great
pleasure
in
again
beholding
the
spot
which
for
six
years
was
the
scene
of
our
boysh
sports
and
studies
taking
advantage
of
the
emperor
good
humour
i
ventured
to
tell
him
what
happiness
it
would
give
me
if
it
were
possible
that
i
could
share
with
him
the
revival
of
all
recollections
which
were
mutually
dear
to
us
but
napoleon
after
a
moment
pause
said
with
extreme
kindness
hark
ye
bourrienne
in
your
situation
and
mine
this
can
not
be
it
is
more
than
two
years
since
we
parted
what
would
be
said
of
so
sudden
a
reconciliation
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
have
regretted
you
and
the
circumstances
in
which
i
have
frequently
been
placed
have
often
made
me
wish
to
recall
you
at
boulogne
i
was
quite
resolved
upon
it
rapp
perhaps
has
informed
you
of
it
he
liked
you
and
he
assured
me
that
he
would
be
delighted
at
your
return
but
if
upon
reflection
i
changed
my
mind
it
was
because
as
i
have
often
told
you
i
will
not
have
it
said
that
i
stand
in
need
of
any
one
no
go
to
hamburg
i
have
formed
some
projects
respecting
germany
in
which
you
can
be
useful
to
me
it
is
there
i
will
give
a
mortal
blow
to
england
i
will
deprive
her
of
the
continent
besides
i
have
some
ideas
not
yet
matured
which
extend
much
farther
there
is
not
sufficient
unanimity
amongst
the
nations
of
europe
european
society
must
be
regenerated
a
superior
power
must
control
the
other
powers
and
compel
them
to
live
in
peace
with
each
other
and
france
is
well
situated
for
that
purpose
for
details
you
will
receive
instructions
from
talleyrand
but
i
recommend
you
above
all
things
to
keep
a
strict
watch
on
the
emigrants
woe
to
them
if
they
become
too
dangerous
i
know
that
there
are
still
agitators
among
them
all
the
de
versailles
the
courtiers
of
the
old
school
but
they
are
moths
who
will
burn
themselves
in
the
candle
you
have
been
an
emigrant
yourself
bourrienne
you
feel
a
partiality
for
them
and
you
know
that
i
have
allowed
upwards
of
two
hundred
of
them
to
return
upon
your
recommendation
but
the
case
is
altered
those
who
are
abroad
are
hardened
they
do
not
wish
to
return
home
watch
them
closely
that
is
the
only
particular
direction
i
give
you
you
are
to
be
minister
from
france
to
hamburg
but
your
place
will
be
an
independent
one
besides
your
correspondence
with
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
i
authorise
you
to
write
to
me
personally
whenever
you
have
anything
particular
to
communicate
you
will
likewise
correspond
with
fouche
here
the
emperor
remained
silent
for
a
moment
and
i
was
preparing
to
retire
but
he
detained
me
saying
in
the
kindest
manner
what
are
you
going
already
bourrienne
are
you
in
a
hurry
let
us
chat
a
little
longer
god
knows
when
we
may
see
each
other
again
then
after
two
or
three
moments
silence
he
said
the
more
i
reflect
on
our
situation
on
our
former
intimacy
and
our
subsequent
separation
the
more
i
see
the
necessity
of
your
going
to
hamburg
go
then
my
dear
fellow
i
advise
you
trust
me
when
do
you
think
of
setting
out
in
may
in
may
ah
i
shall
be
in
milan
then
for
i
wish
to
stop
at
turin
i
like
the
piedmontese
they
are
the
best
soldiers
in
italy
sire
the
king
of
italy
will
be
the
junior
of
the
emperor
of
france
i
alluded
to
a
conversation
which
i
had
with
napoleon
when
we
first
went
to
the
tuileries
he
spoke
to
me
about
his
projects
of
royalty
and
i
stated
the
difficulties
which
i
thought
he
would
experience
in
getting
himself
acknowledged
by
the
old
reigning
families
of
europe
if
it
comes
to
that
he
replied
i
will
dethrone
them
all
and
then
i
shall
be
the
oldest
sovereign
among
bourrienne
ah
so
you
recollect
what
i
said
one
day
at
the
tuileries
but
my
dear
fellow
i
have
yet
a
devilish
long
way
to
go
before
i
gain
my
point
at
the
rate
sire
at
which
you
are
going
you
will
not
be
long
in
reaching
it
longer
than
you
imagine
i
see
all
the
obstacles
in
my
way
but
they
do
not
alarm
me
england
is
everywhere
and
the
struggle
is
between
her
and
me
i
see
how
it
will
be
the
whole
of
europe
will
be
our
instruments
sometimes
serving
one
sometimes
the
other
but
at
bottom
the
dispute
is
wholly
between
england
and
france
a
propos
said
the
emperor
changing
the
subject
for
all
who
knew
him
are
aware
that
this
propos
was
his
favourite
and
indeed
his
only
mode
of
transition
a
propos
bourrienne
you
surely
must
have
heard
of
the
departure
of
jaubert
amedee
jaubart
had
been
with
napoleon
in
egypt
and
was
appointed
to
the
cabinet
of
the
consul
as
secretary
interpreter
of
oriental
languages
he
was
sent
on
several
missions
to
the
east
and
brought
back
is
goats
from
thibet
naturalising
in
france
the
manufacture
of
cashmeres
he
became
a
peer
of
france
under
the
monarchy
of
july
and
his
mission
what
is
said
on
the
subject
sire
i
have
only
heard
it
slightly
alluded
to
his
father
however
to
whom
he
said
nothing
respecting
the
object
of
his
journey
knowing
i
was
intimate
with
jaubert
came
to
me
to
ascertain
whether
i
could
allay
his
anxiety
respecting
a
journey
of
the
duration
of
which
he
could
form
no
idea
the
precipitate
departure
of
his
son
had
filled
him
with
apprehension
i
told
him
the
truth
that
jaubert
had
said
no
more
to
me
on
the
subject
than
to
him
then
you
do
not
know
where
he
is
gone
i
beg
your
pardon
sire
i
know
very
well
how
the
devil
said
bonaparte
suddenly
turning
on
me
a
look
of
astonishment
no
one
i
declare
has
ever
told
me
but
i
guessed
it
having
received
a
letter
from
jaubert
dated
leipsic
i
recollected
what
your
majesty
had
often
told
me
of
your
views
respecting
persia
and
india
i
have
not
forgotten
our
conversation
in
egypt
nor
the
great
projects
which
you
enfolded
to
me
to
relieve
the
solitude
and
sometimes
the
weariness
of
the
cabinet
of
cairo
besides
i
long
since
knew
your
opinion
of
amedee
of
his
fidelity
his
ability
and
his
courage
i
felt
convinced
therefore
that
he
had
a
mission
to
the
shah
of
persia
you
guessed
right
but
i
beg
of
you
bourrienne
say
nothing
of
this
to
any
person
whatever
secrecy
on
this
point
is
of
grew
importance
the
english
would
do
him
an
ill
turn
for
they
are
well
aware
that
my
views
are
directed
against
their
possessions
and
their
influence
in
the
east
i
think
sire
that
my
answer
to
worthy
father
is
a
sufficient
guarantee
for
my
discretion
besides
it
was
a
mere
supposition
on
my
part
and
i
could
have
stated
nothing
with
certainty
before
your
majesty
had
the
kindness
to
inform
me
of
the
fact
instead
of
going
to
hamburg
if
your
majesty
pleases
i
will
join
jaubert
accompany
him
to
persia
and
undertake
half
his
mission
how
would
you
go
with
him
yes
sire
i
am
much
attached
to
him
he
is
an
excellent
man
and
i
am
sure
that
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
have
me
with
him
but
stop
bourrienne
this
perhaps
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
you
know
a
little
of
the
east
you
are
accustomed
to
the
climate
you
could
assist
jaubert
but
no
daubert
must
be
already
far
off
i
fear
you
could
not
overtake
him
and
besides
you
have
a
numerous
family
you
will
be
more
useful
to
me
in
germany
all
things
considered
go
to
hamburg
you
know
the
country
and
what
is
better
you
speak
the
language
i
could
see
that
bonaparte
still
had
something
to
say
to
me
as
we
were
walking
up
and
down
the
room
he
stopped
and
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
sadness
he
said
bourrienne
you
must
before
i
proceed
to
italy
do
me
a
service
you
sometimes
visit
my
wife
and
it
is
right
it
is
fit
you
should
you
have
been
too
long
one
of
the
family
not
to
continue
your
friendship
with
her
go
to
her
this
employment
of
bourrienne
to
remonstrate
with
josephine
is
a
complete
answer
to
the
charge
sometimes
made
that
napoleon
while
scolding
really
encouraged
the
foolish
expenses
of
his
wife
as
keeping
her
under
his
control
josephine
was
incorrigible
on
the
very
day
of
her
death
says
madame
de
remusat
she
wished
to
put
on
a
very
pretty
because
she
thought
the
emperor
of
russia
would
perhaps
come
to
see
her
she
died
all
covered
with
ribbons
and
satin
one
would
not
sure
be
frightful
when
one
dead
as
for
josephine
great
fault
her
failure
to
give
napoleon
an
heir
he
did
not
always
wish
for
one
in
on
his
brother
jerome
jokingly
advising
josephine
to
give
the
consul
a
little
caesar
napoleon
broke
out
yea
that
he
may
end
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
alexander
believe
me
messieurs
that
at
the
present
time
it
is
better
not
to
have
children
i
mean
when
one
is
condemned
to
role
nations
the
fate
of
the
king
of
rome
shows
that
the
exclamation
was
only
too
true
endeavour
once
more
to
make
her
sensible
of
her
mad
extravagance
every
day
i
discover
new
instances
of
it
and
it
distresses
me
when
i
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
i
am
vexed
i
get
angry
she
weeps
i
forgive
her
i
pay
her
bills
she
makes
fair
promises
but
the
same
thing
occurs
over
and
over
again
if
she
had
only
borne
me
a
child
it
is
the
torment
of
my
life
not
to
have
a
child
i
plainly
perceive
that
my
power
will
never
be
firmly
established
until
i
have
one
if
i
die
without
an
heir
not
one
of
my
brothers
is
capable
of
supplying
my
place
all
is
begun
but
nothing
is
ended
god
knows
what
will
happen
go
and
see
josephine
and
do
not
forget
my
then
he
resumed
the
gaiety
which
he
had
exhibited
at
intervals
during
our
conversation
far
clouds
driven
by
the
wind
do
not
traverse
the
horizon
with
such
rapidity
as
different
ideas
and
sensations
succeeded
each
other
m
napoleon
mind
he
dismissed
me
with
his
usual
nod
of
the
head
and
seeing
him
in
such
good
humour
i
said
on
departing
well
sire
you
are
going
to
hear
the
old
bell
of
brienne
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
please
you
better
than
the
bells
of
ruel
he
replied
that
tree
you
are
right
adieu
such
are
my
recollections
of
this
conversation
which
lasted
for
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
we
walked
about
all
the
time
for
bonaparte
was
indefatigable
in
audiences
of
this
sort
and
would
i
believe
have
walked
and
talked
for
a
whole
day
without
being
aware
of
it
i
left
him
and
according
to
his
desire
went
to
see
madame
bonaparte
which
indeed
i
had
intended
to
do
before
he
requested
it
i
found
josephine
with
madame
de
la
rochefoucauld
who
had
long
been
in
her
suite
and
who
a
short
time
before
had
obtained
the
title
of
lady
of
honour
to
the
empress
madame
de
la
rochefoucauld
was
a
very
amiable
woman
of
mild
disposition
and
was
a
favourite
with
josephine
when
i
told
the
empress
that
i
had
just
left
the
emperor
she
thinking
that
i
would
not
speak
freely
before
a
third
person
made
a
sign
to
madame
de
la
rochefoucauld
to
retire
i
had
no
trouble
in
introducing
the
conversation
on
the
subject
concerning
which
napoleon
had
directed
me
to
speak
to
josephine
for
after
the
interchange
of
a
few
indifferent
remarks
she
herself
told
me
of
a
violent
scene
which
had
occurred
between
her
and
the
emperor
two
days
before
when
i
wrote
to
you
yesterday
said
she
to
announce
your
appointment
and
to
tell
you
that
bonaparte
would
recall
you
i
hoped
that
you
would
come
to
see
me
on
quitting
him
but
i
did
not
think
that
he
would
have
sent
for
you
so
soon
ah
how
i
wish
that
you
were
still
with
him
bourrienne
you
could
make
him
hear
reason
i
know
not
who
takes
pleasure
in
bearing
tales
to
him
but
really
i
think
there
are
persons
busy
everywhere
in
finding
out
my
debts
and
telling
him
of
them
these
complaints
so
gently
uttered
by
josephine
rendered
less
difficult
the
preparatory
mission
with
which
i
commenced
the
exercise
of
my
diplomatic
functions
i
acquainted
madame
bonaparte
with
all
that
the
emperor
had
said
to
me
i
reminded
her
of
the
affair
of
the
francs
which
we
had
settled
with
half
that
sum
i
even
dropped
some
allusions
to
the
promises
she
had
made
how
can
i
help
it
said
she
is
it
my
fault
josephine
uttered
these
words
in
a
tone
of
sincerity
which
was
at
once
affecting
and
ludicrous
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
are
brought
to
me
she
continued
they
are
praised
up
i
buy
them
i
am
not
asked
for
the
money
and
all
of
a
sudden
when
i
have
got
none
they
come
upon
me
with
demands
for
payment
this
reaches
napoleon
ears
and
he
gets
angry
when
i
have
money
bourrienne
you
know
how
i
employ
it
i
give
it
principally
to
the
unfortunate
who
solicit
my
assistance
and
to
poor
emigants
but
i
will
try
to
be
more
economical
in
future
tell
him
so
if
you
see
him
again
but
is
it
not
my
duty
to
bestow
as
much
in
charity
as
i
can
yes
madame
but
permit
me
to
say
that
nothing
requires
greater
discernment
than
the
distribution
of
chaxity
if
you
had
always
sat
upon
a
throne
you
might
have
always
supposed
that
your
bounty
always
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
deserving
but
you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
it
oftener
falls
to
the
lot
of
intrigue
than
to
the
meritorious
needy
i
can
not
disguise
from
you
that
the
emperor
was
very
earnest
when
he
spoke
on
this
subject
and
he
desired
me
to
tell
you
so
did
he
reproach
me
with
nothing
else
no
madame
you
know
the
influence
you
have
over
him
with
respect
to
everything
but
what
relates
to
politics
allow
a
faithful
and
sincere
friend
to
prevail
upon
you
seriously
not
to
vex
him
on
this
point
bourrienne
i
give
you
my
word
adieu
my
friend
in
communicating
to
josephine
what
the
emperor
had
said
to
me
i
took
care
not
to
touch
a
chord
which
would
have
awakened
feelings
far
more
painful
to
her
than
even
the
emperor
harsh
reproof
on
account
of
her
extravagance
poor
josephine
how
i
should
have
afflicted
her
had
i
uttered
a
word
of
bonaparte
regret
at
not
having
a
child
she
always
had
a
presentiment
of
the
fate
that
one
day
awaited
her
besides
josephine
told
the
truth
in
assuring
me
that
it
was
not
her
fault
that
she
spent
as
she
did
at
least
all
the
time
i
was
with
both
of
them
order
and
economy
were
no
more
compatible
with
her
than
moderation
and
patience
with
napoleon
the
sight
of
the
least
waste
put
him
beside
himself
and
that
was
a
sensation
his
wife
hardly
ever
spared
him
he
saw
with
irritation
the
eagerness
of
his
family
to
gain
riches
the
more
he
gave
the
more
insatiable
they
appeared
with
the
exception
of
louis
whose
inclinations
were
always
upright
and
his
tastes
moderate
as
for
the
other
members
of
his
family
they
annoyed
him
so
much
by
their
importunity
that
one
day
he
said
really
to
listen
to
them
it
would
be
thought
that
i
had
wasted
the
heritage

that

provided

are

notwithstanding
the
slight
estimation
in
which
bonaparte
held
voltaire
he
probably
without
being
aware
of
this
irreverent
satire
put
it
into
practice
the
court
of
rome
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
shortly
after
his
coronation
the
pope
or
rather
the
cardinals
his
advisers
conceiving
that
so
great
an
instance
of
complaisance
as
the
journey
of
his
holiness
to
paris
ought
not
to
go
for
nothing
demanded
a
compensation
which
had
they
been
better
acquainted
with
bonaparte
character
and
policy
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
soliciting
the
holy
see
demanded
the
restitution
of
avignon
bologna
and
some
parts
of
the
italian
territory
which
had
formerly
been
subject
to
the
pope
dominion
it
may
be
imagined
how
such
demands
were
received
by
napoleon
particularly
after
he
had
obtained
all
he
wanted
from
the
pope
it
was
it
must
be
confessed
a
great
mistake
of
the
court
of
rome
whose
policy
is
usually
so
artful
and
adroit
not
to
make
this
demand
till
after
the
coronation
had
it
been
made
the
condition
of
the
pope
journey
to
france
perhaps
bonaparte
would
have
consented
to
give
up
not
avignon
certainly
but
the
italian
territories
with
the
intention
of
taking
them
back
again
be
this
as
it
may
these
tardy
claims
which
were
peremptorily
rejected
created
an
extreme
coolness
between
napoleon
and
pius
vii
the
public
did
not
immediately
perceive
it
but
there
is
in
the
public
an
instinct
of
reason
which
the
most
able
politicians
never
can
impose
upon
and
all
eyes
were
opened
when
it
was
known
that
the
pope
after
having
crowned
napoleon
as
emperor
of
france
refused
to
crown
him
as
sovereign
of
the
regenerated
kingdom
of
italy
napoleon
left
paris
on
the
of
april
to
take
possession
of
the
iron
crown
at
milan
the
pope
remained
some
time
longer
in
the
french
capital
the
prolonged
presence
of
his
holiness
was
not
without
its
influence
on
the
religious
feelings
of
the
people
so
great
was
the
respect
inspired
by
the
benign
countenance
and
mild
manners
of
the
pope
when
the
period
of
his
persecutions
arrived
it
would
have
been
well
for
bonaparte
had
pius
vii
never
been
seen
in
paris
for
it
was
impossible
to
view
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
victim
the
man
whose
truly
evangelic
meekness
had
been
duly
appreciated
bonaparte
did
not
evince
great
impatience
to
seize
the
crown
of
italy
which
he
well
knew
could
not
escape
him
he
stayed
a
considerable
time
at
turin
where
he
resided
in
the
stupinis
palace
which
may
be
called
the
st
cloud
of
the
kings
of
sardinia
the
emperor
cajoled
the
piedmontese
general
menou
who
was
made
governor
of
piedmont
remained
there
till
napoleon
founded
the
general
government
of
the
transalpine
departments
in
favour
of
his
the
prince
borghese
of
whom
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
anything
else
than
a
roman
prince
napoleon
was
still
at
turin
when
the
pope
passed
through
that
city
on
his
return
to
rome
napoleon
had
a
final
interview
with
his
holiness
to
whom
he
now
affected
to
show
the
greatest
personal
deference
from
turin
bonaparte
proceeded
to
alessandria
where
he
commenced
those
immense
works
on
which
such
vast
sums
were
expended
he
had
many
times
spoken
to
me
of
his
projects
respecting
alessandria
as
i
have
already
observed
all
his
great
measures
as
emperor
were
merely
the
execution
of
projects
conceived
at
a
time
when
his
future
elevation
could
have
been
only
a
dream
of
the
imagination
he
one
day
said
to
berthier
in
my
presence
during
our
sojurn
at
milan
after
the
battle
of
marengo
with
alessandria
in
my
possession
i
should
always
be
master
of
italy
it
might
be
made
the
strongest
fortress
in
the
world
it
is
capable
of
containing
a
garrison
of
men
with
provisions
for
six
months
should
insurrection
take
place
should
austria
send
a
formidable
force
here
the
french
troops
might
retire
to
alessandria
and
stand
a
six
months
siege
six
months
would
be
more
than
sufficient
wherever
i
might
be
to
enable
me
to
fall
upon
italy
rout
the
austrians
and
raise
the
siege
of
alessandria
as
he
was
so
near
the
field
of
marengo
the
emperor
did
not
fail
to
visit
it
and
to
add
to
this
solemnity
he
reviewed
on
the
field
all
the
corps
of
french
troops
which
were
in
italy
rapp
told
me
afterwards
that
the
emperor
had
taken
with
him
from
paris
the
dress
and
the
hat
which
he
wore
on
the
day
of
that
memorable
battle
with
the
intention
of
wearing
them
on
the
field
where
it
was
fought
he
afterwards
proceeded
by
the
way
of
casal
to
milan
there
the
most
brilliant
reception
he
had
yet
experienced
awaited
him
his
sojourn
at
milan
was
not
distinguished
by
outward
demonstrations
of
enthusiasm
alone
durszzo
the
last
doge
of
genoa
added
another
gem
to
the
crown
of
italy
by
supplicating
the
emperor
in
the
name
of
the
republic
of
which
he
was
the
representative
to
permit
genoa
to
exchange
her
independence
for
the
honour
of
becoming
a
department
of
france
this
offer
as
may
be
guessed
was
merely
a
plan
contrived
beforehand
it
was
accepted
with
an
air
of
protecting
kindness
and
at
the
same
moment
that
the
country
of
andrea
doria
was
effaced
from
the
list
of
nations
its
last
doge
was
included
among
the
number
of
french
senators
genoa
which
formerly
prided
herself
in
her
surname
the
superb
became
the
chief
station
of
the
military
division
the
emperor
went
to
take
possession
of
the
city
in
person
and
slept
in
the
doria
palace
in
the
bed
where
charles
had
lain
he
left
le
brun
at
genoa
as
at
milan
the
emperor
occupied
the
palace
of
monza
the
old
iron
crown
of
the
kings
of
lombardy
was
brought
from
the
dust
in
which
it
had
been
buried
and
the
new
coronation
took
place
in
the
cathedral
at
milan
the
largest
in
italy
with
the
exception
of
peter
at
rome
napoleon
received
the
crown
from
the
hands
of
the
archbishop
of
milan
and
placed
it
on
his
head
exclaiming
dieu
me
donnee
gare
a
qui
la
touche
this
became
the
motto
of
the
order
of
the
iron
crown
which
the
emperor
founded
in
commemoration
of
his
being
crowned
king
of
italy
napoleon
was
crowned
in
the
month
of
may
and
here
i
can
not
avoid
correcting
some
gross
and
inconceivable
errors
into
which
napoleon
must
have
voluntarily
fallen
at
helena
the
memorial
states
that
the
celebrated
singer
madame
grasaini
attracted
his
attention
at
the
time
of
the
coronation
napoleon
alleges
that
madame
grassini
on
that
occasion
said
to
him
when
i
was
in
the
prime
of
my
beauty
and
talent
all
i
wished
was
that
you
would
bestow
a
single
look
upon
me
that
wish
was
not
fulfilled
and
now
you
notice
me
when
i
am
no
longer
worthy
your
attention
i
confess
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
could
induce
napoleon
to
invent
such
a
story
he
might
have
recollected
his
acquaintance
with
madame
grassini
at
milan
before
the
battle
of
marengo
it
was
in
and
not
in
that
i
was
first
introduced
to
her
and
i
know
that
i
several
times
took
tea
with
her
and
bonaparte
in
the
general
apartments
i
remember
also
another
circumstance
which
is
that
on
the
night
when
i
awoke
bonaparte
to
announce
to
him
the
capitulation
of
genoa
madame
grassini
also
awoke
napoleon
was
charmed
with
madame
delicious
voice
and
if
his
imperious
duties
had
permitted
it
he
would
have
listened
with
ecstasy
to
her
singing
for
hours
together
whilst
napoleon
was
at
milan
priding
himself
on
his
double
sovereignty
some
schemes
were
set
on
foot
at
vienna
and
petersburg
which
i
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
notice
the
emperor
indeed
gave
cause
for
just
complaint
by
the
fact
of
annexing
genoa
to
the
empire
within
four
months
after
his
solemn
declaration
to
the
legislative
body
in
which
he
pledged
himself
in
the
face
of
france
and
europe
not
to
seek
any
aggrandisement
of
territory
the
pretext
of
a
voluntary
offer
on
the
part
of
genoa
was
too
absurd
to
deceive
any
one
the
rapid
progress
of
napoleon
ambition
could
not
escape
the
observation
of
the
cabinet
of
vienna
which
began
to
allow
increased
symptoms
of
hostility
the
change
which
was
effected
in
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
cisalpine
republic
was
likewise
an
act
calculated
to
excite
remonstrance
on
the
part
of
all
the
powers
who
were
not
entirely
subject
to
the
yoke
of
france
he
disguised
the
taking
of
genoa
under
the
name
of
a
gift
and
the
possession
of
italy
under
the
appearance
of
a
mere
change
of
denomination
notwithstanding
these
flagrant
outrages
the
exclusive
apologists
of
napoleon
have
always
asserted
that
he
did
not
wish
for
war
and
he
himself
maintained
that
assertion
at
helena
it
is
said
that
he
was
always
attacked
and
hence
a
conclusion
is
drawn
in
favour
of
his
love
of
peace
i
acknowledge
bonaparte
would
never
have
fired
a
single
if
all
the
powers
of
europe
had
submitted
to
be
pillaged
by
him
one
after
the
other
without
opposition
it
was
in
fact
declaring
war
against
them
to
place
them
under
the
necessity
of
breaking
a
peace
during
the
continuance
of
which
he
was
augmenting
his
power
and
gratifying
his
ambition
as
if
in
defiance
of
europe
in
this
way
napoleon
commenced
all
the
wars
in
which
he
was
engaged
with
the
exception
of
that
which
followed
the
peace
of
marengo
and
which
terminated
in
moreau
triumph
at
hohenlinden
as
there
was
no
liberty
of
the
press
in
france
he
found
it
easy
to
deceive
the
nation
he
was
in
fact
attacked
and
thus
he
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
undertaking
his
great
military
expeditions
without
being
responsible
in
the
event
of
failure
during
the
emperor
stay
in
the
capital
of
the
new
kingdom
of
italy
he
received
the
first
intelligence
of
the
dissatisfaction
of
austria
and
russia
that
dissatisfaction
was
not
of
recent
date
when
i
entered
on
my
functions
at
hamburg
i
learned
some
curious
details
which
i
will
relate
in
their
proper
place
respecting
the
secret
negotiations
which
had
been
carried
on
for
a
considerable
time
previously
to
the
commencement
of
hostilities
even
prussia
was
no
stranger
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
austria
and
russia
i
do
not
mean
the
king
but
the
cabinet
of
berlin
which
was
then
under
the
control
of
chancellor
hardenberg
for
the
king
of
prussia
had
always
personally
declared
himself
in
favour
of
the
exact
observance
of
treaties
even
when
their
conditions
were
not
honourable
be
that
as
it
may
the
cabinet
of
berlin
although
dissatisfied
in
with
the
rapid
progress
of
napoleon
ambition
was
nevertheless
constrained
to
conceal
its
discontent
owing
to
the
presence
of
the
french
troops
in
hanover
on
returning
from
milan
the
emperor
ordered
the
erection
of
a
monument
on
the
great
bernard
in
commemoration
of
the
victory
of
marengo
denon
who
accompanied
napoleon
told
me
that
he
made
a
use
less
search
to
discover
the
body
of
desaix
which
bonaparte
wished
to
be
buried
beneath
the
monument
and
that
it
was
at
length
found
by
general
savary
it
is
therefore
certain
that
the
ashes
of
the
brave
desaix
repose
on
the
summit
of
the
alps
the
emperor
arrived
in
paris
about
the
end
of
june
and
instantly
set
off
for
the
camp
at
boulogne
it
was
now
once
more
believed
that
the
project
of
invading
england
would
be
accomplished
this
idea
obtained
the
greater
credit
because
bonaparte
caused
some
experiments
for
embarkation
to
be
made
in
his
presence
these
experiments
however
led
to
no
result
about
this
period
a
fatal
event
but
too
effectually
contributed
to
strengthen
the
opinion
of
the
inferiority
of
our
navy
a
french
squadron
consisting
of
fifteen
ships
fell
in
with
the
english
fleet
commanded
by
admiral
calder
who
had
only
nine
vessels
under
his
command
and
in
an
engagement
which
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
would
terminate
in
our
favour
we
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
two
ships
the
invasion
of
england
was
as
little
the
object
of
this
as
of
the
previous
journey
to
boulogne
all
napoleon
had
in
view
was
to
stimulate
the
enthusiasm
of
the
troops
and
to
hold
out
those
threats
against
england
when
conceived
necessary
for
diverting
attention
from
the
real
motive
of
his
hostile
preparations
which
was
to
invade
germany
and
repulse
the
russian
troops
who
had
begun
their
march
towards
austria
such
was
the
true
object
of
napoleons
last
journey
to
boulogne
i
had
been
some
time
at
hamburg
when
these
events
took
place
and
it
was
curious
to
observe
the
effect
they
produced
but
i
must
not
forget
one
circumstance
in
which
i
am
personally
concerned
and
which
brings
me
back
to
the
time
when
i
was
in
paris
my
new
title
of
minister
plenipotentiary
obliged
me
to
see
a
little
more
of
society
than
during
the
period
when
prudence
required
me
to
live
as
it
were
in
retirement
i
had
received
sincere
congratulations
from
duroc
rape
and
lauriston
the
three
friends
who
had
shown
the
greatest
readiness
to
serve
my
interests
with
the
emperor
and
i
had
frequent
occasion
to
see
talleyrand
as
my
functions
belonged
to
his
department
the
emperor
on
my
farewell
audience
having
informed
me
that
i
was
to
correspond
directly
with
the
minister
of
the
general
police
i
called
on
fouche
who
invited
me
to
spend
some
days
at
his
estate
of
i
accepted
the
invitation
because
i
wanted
to
confer
with
him
and
i
spent
sunday
and
monday
the
and
of
april
at
fouche
like
the
emperor
frequently
revealed
what
he
intended
to
conceal
but
he
had
such
a
reputation
for
cunning
that
this
sort
of
indiscretion
was
attended
by
no
inconvenience
to
him
he
was
supposed
to
be
such
a
constant
dissembler
that
those
who
did
not
know
him
well
looked
upon
the
truth
when
he
spoke
it
merely
as
an
artful
snare
laid
to
entrap
them
i
however
knew
that
celebrated
person
too
well
to
confound
his
cunning
with
his
indiscretion
the
best
way
to
get
out
of
him
more
than
he
was
aware
of
was
to
let
him
talk
on
without
interruption
there
were
very
few
visitors
at
and
during
the
two
days
i
spent
there
i
had
several
conversations
with
fouche
he
told
me
a
great
deal
about
the
events
of
and
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
advised
napoleon
to
declare
himself
emperor
i
have
no
preference
says
fouche
for
one
form
of
government
more
than
another
forms
signify
nothing
the
first
object
of
the
revolution
was
not
the
overthrow
of
the
bourbons
but
merely
the
reform
of
abuses
and
the
destruction
of
prejudices
however
when
it
was
discovered
that
louis
xvi
had
neither
firmness
to
refuse
what
he
did
not
wish
to
grant
nor
good
faith
to
grant
what
his
weakness
had
led
him
to
promise
it
was
evident
that
the
bourbons
could
no
longer
reign
over
france
and
things
were
carried
to
such
a
length
that
we
were
under
the
necessity
of
condemning
louis
xvi
and
resorting
to
energetic
measures
you
know
all
that
passed
up
to
the
brumaire
and
after
we
all
perceived
that
a
republic
could
not
exist
in
france
the
question
therefore
was
to
ensure
the
perpetual
removal
of
the
bourbons
and
i
behaved
the
only
means
for
so
doing
was
to
transfer
the
inheritance
of
their
throne
to
another
family
some
time
before
the
brumaire
i
had
a
conversation
with
sieyes
and
barras
in
which
it
was
proposed
in
case
of
the
directory
being
threatened
to
recall
the
duke
of
orleans
and
i
could
see
very
well
that
barras
favoured
that
suggestion
although
he
alluded
to
it
merely
as
a
report
that
was
circulated
about
and
recommended
me
to
pay
attention
to
it
sieyes
said
nothing
and
i
settled
the
question
by
observing
that
if
any
such
thing
had
been
agitated
i
must
have
been
informed
of
it
through
the
reports
of
my
agents
i
added
that
the
restoration
of
the
throne
to
a
collateral
branch
of
the
bourbons
would
be
an
impolitic
act
and
would
but
temporarily
change
the
position
of
those
who
had
brought
about
the
revolution
i
rendered
an
account
of
this
interview
with
barras
to
general
bonaparte
the
first
time
i
had
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
him
after
your
return
from
egypt
i
sounded
him
and
i
was
perfectly
convinced
that
in
the
state
of
decrepitude
into
which
the
directory
had
fallen
he
was
just
the
man
we
wanted
i
therefore
adopted
such
measures
with
the
police
as
tended
to
promote
his
elevation
to
the
first
magistracy
he
soon
showed
himself
ungrateful
and
instead
of
giving
me
all
his
confidence
he
tried
to
outwit
me
he
put
into
the
hands
of
a
number
of
persons
various
matters
of
police
which
were
worse
than
useless
most
of
their
agents
who
were
my
creatures
obeyed
my
instructions
in
their
reports
and
it
often
happened
that
the
first
consul
thought
he
had
discovered
through
the
medium
of
others
information
that
came
from
me
and
of
the
falsehood
of
which
i
easily
convinced
him
i
confess
i
was
at
fault
on
the
nivoise
but
are
there
any
human
means
of
preventing
two
men
who
have
no
accomplices
from
bringing
a
plot
to
execution
you
saw
the
first
consul
on
his
return
from
the
opera
you
heard
all
his
declamations
i
felt
assured
that
the
infernal
machine
was
the
work
of
the
royalists
i
told
the
emperor
this
and
he
was
i
am
sure
convinced
of
it
but
he
nevertheless
proscribes
a
number
of
men
on
the
mere
pretence
of
their
old
opinions
do
you
suppose
i
am
ignorant
of
what
he
said
of
me
and
of
my
vote
at
the
national
convention
most
assuredly
it
ill
becomes
him
to
reproach
the
conventionists
it
was
that
vote
which
placed
the
crown
upon
his
head
but
for
the
situation
in
which
we
were
placed
by
that
event
which
circumstances
had
rendered
inevitable
what
should
we
have
cared
for
the
chance
of
seeing
the
bourbons
return
you
must
have
remarked
that
the
republicans
who
were
not
conventionists
were
in
general
more
averse
than
we
to
the
proceedings
of
the
brumaire
as
for
example
bernadotte
and
moreau
i
know
positively
that
moreau
was
averse
to
the
consulate
and
that
it
was
only
from
irresolution
that
he
accepted
the
custody
of
the
directory
i
know
also
that
he
excused
himself
to
his
prisoners
for
the
duty
which
had
devolved
upon
him
they
themselves
told
me
this
fouche
entered
further
into
many
details
respecting
his
conduct
and
the
motives
which
had
urged
him
to
do
what
he
did
in
favour
of
the
first
consul
my
memory
does
not
enable
me
to
report
all
he
told
me
but
i
distinctly
recollect
that
the
impression
made
on
my
mind
by
what
fell
from
him
was
that
he
had
acted
merely
with
a
view
to
his
own
interests
he
did
not
conceal
his
satisfaction
at
having
outwitted
regnier
and
obliged
bonaparte
to
recall
him
that
he
set
in
motion
every
spring
calculated
to
unite
the
conspirators
or
rather
to
convert
the
discontented
into
conspirators
is
evident
from
the
following
remarks
which
fell
from
him
with
the
information
i
possessed
had
i
remained
in
office
it
is
probable
that
i
might
have
prevented
the
conspiracy
but
bonaparte
would
still
have
had
to
fear
the
rivalry
of
moreau
he
would
not
have
been
emperor
and
we
should
still
have
had
to
dread
the
return
of
the
bourbons
of
which
thank
god
there
is
now
no
fear
during
my
stay
at
i
said
but
little
to
fouche
about
my
long
audience
with
the
emperor
however
i
thought
i
might
inform
him
that
i
was
authorised
to
correspond
directly
with
his
majesty
i
thought
it
useless
to
conceal
this
fact
since
he
would
soon
learn
it
through
his
agents
i
also
said
a
few
words
about
bonaparte
regret
at
not
having
children
my
object
was
to
learn
fouche
opinion
on
this
subject
and
it
was
not
without
a
feeling
of
indignation
that
i
heard
him
say
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
empress
will
soon
die
her
death
will
remove
many
difficulties
sooner
or
later
he
must
take
a
wife
who
will
bear
him
a
child
for
as
long
as
he
has
no
direct
heir
there
is
every
chance
that
his
death
will
be
the
signal
for
a
revolution
his
brothers
are
perfectly
incapable
of
filling
his
place
and
a
new
party
would
rise
up
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
which
must
be
prevented
above
all
things
at
present
they
are
not
dangerous
though
they
still
have
active
and
devoted
agents
altona
is
full
of
them
and
you
will
be
surrounded
by
them
i
beg
of
you
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
them
and
render
me
a
strict
account
of
all
their
movements
and
even
of
their
most
trivial
actions
as
they
have
recourse
to
all
sorts
of
disguises
you
can
not
be
too
vigilant
therefore
it
will
be
advisable
in
the
first
place
to
establish
a
good
system
of
espionage
but
have
a
care
of
the
spies
who
serve
both
sides
for
they
swarm
in
germany
this
is
all
i
recollect
of
my
conversations
with
fouche

character
general
walmoden
had
just
signed
the
capitulation

sublingen
with

mortier
who
had
the
command
in
hanover
the
english
government
refused
to
ratify
this
because
it
stipulated
that
the
troops
should
be
prisoners
of
war
bonaparte
had
two
motives
for
relaxing
this
hard
condition
he
wished
to
keep
hanover
as
a
compensation
for
malta
and
to
assure
the
means
of
embarrassing
and
attacking
prussia
which
he
now
began
to
distrust
by
advancing
upon
prussia
he
would
secure
his
left

that
when
convenient
he
might

mortier
therefore
received
orders
to
reduce

england

she
thought
herself
threatened
expended
considerable
sums
for
the
transport

her
precipitation
was
indescribable
and
she
paid
the
most
exorbitant
charges
for
the
hire
of
ships
several
houses
in
hamburg
made
fortunes
on
this
occasion
experience
has
long
since
proved
that
it
is
not
at
their
source
that
secret
transactions
are
most
readily
known
the
intelligence
of
an
event
frequently
resounds
at
a
distance
while
the

itself
is
almost
entirely
unknown
in
the
place
of
its
occurrence
the
direct
influence
of

by
the
strongest
of

common

commercial
correspondence
frequently
presents
a
fertile
field
for
observation
and
affords
much
valuable
information
which
often
escapes
the
inquiries
of
government
agents
i
resolved
to
form
a
connection
with
some
of
the
mercantile
houses
which
maintained
extensive
and
frequent
communications
with
the
northern
states
i
knew
that
by
obtaining
their
confidence
i
might
gain
a
knowledge
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
russia
sweden
england
and
austria
among
the
subjects
upon
which
it
was
desirable
to
obtain
information
i
included
negotations
treaties
military
measures
such
as
recruiting
troops
beyond
the
amount
settled
for
the
peace
establishment
movements
of
troops
the
formation
of
camps
and
magazines
financial
operations
the
of
ships
and
many
other
things
which
though
not
important
in
themselves
frequently
lead
to
the
knowledge
of
what
is
important
i
was
not
inclined
to
place
reliance
on
all
public
reports
and
gossiping
stories
circulated
on
the
exchange
without
close
investigation
for
i
wished
to
avoid
transmitting
home
as
truths
what
might
frequently
be
mere
inventions
i
was
instructed
to
keep
watch
on
the
emigrants
who
were
exceedingly
numerous
in
hamburg
and
its
neighbourhood
mecklenburg
hanover
brunswick
and
holstein
but
i
must
observe
that
my
inspection
was
to
extend
only
to
those
who
were
known
to
be
actually
engaged
in
intrigues
and
plots
i
was
also
to
keep
watch
on
the
state
of
the
public
mind
and
on
the
journals
which
frequently
give
it
a
wrong
direction
and
to
point
out
those
articles
in
the
journals
which
i
thought
censurable
at
first
i
merely
made
verbal
representations
and
complaints
but
i
could
not
always
confine
myself
to
this
course
i
received
such
distinct
and
positive
orders
that
in
spite
of
myself
inspection
was
speedily
converted
into
oppression
complaints
against
the
journals
filled
of
my
despatches
as
the
emperor
wished
to
be
made
acquainted
with
all
that
was
printed
against
him
i
sent
to
paris
in
may
and
consequently
a
very
few
days
after
my
arrival
in
hamburg
a
pamphlet
by
the
celebrated
kotzebue
entitled
of
my
journey
to
naples
and
rome
this
publication
which
was
printed
at
berlin
was
full
of
indecorous
attacks
and
odious
allusions
on
the
emperor
i
was
informed
at
that
time
through
a
certain
channel
that
the
emperor
alexander
had
solicited
general
moreau
to
enter
his
service
and
take
the
command
of
the
russian
infantry
he
offered
him
roubles
to
defray
his
travelling
expenses
at
a
subsequent
period
moreau
unfortunately
accepted
these
offers
and
died
in
the
enemy
ranks
on
the
of
june
bouligny
arrived
at
hamburg
he
was
appointed
to
supersede
at
stockholm
the
latter
minister
had
left
hamburg
on
the
of
june
for
constantinople
where
he
did
not
expect
to
stay
three
months
i
had
several
long
conversations
with
him
before
his
departure
and
he
did
not
appear
to
be
satisfied
with
his
destination
we
frequently
spoke
of
the
king
of
sweden
whose
conduct
blamed
he
was
he
said
a
young
madman
who
without
reflecting
on
the
change
of
time
and
circumstances
wished
to
play
the
part
of
gustavus
adolphus
to
whom
he
bore
no
resemblence
but
in
name
spoke
of
the
king
of
sweden
camp
in
a
tone
of
derision
that
prince
had
returned
to
the
king
of
prussia
the
cordon
of
the
black
eagle
because
the
order
had
been
given
to
the
first
consul
i
understood
that
frederick
william
was
very
much
offended
at
this
proceeding
which
was
as
indecorous
and
absurd
as
the
return
of
the
golden
fleece
by
louis
xvii
to
the
king
of
spain
was
dignified
and
proper
gustavus
adolphus
was
brave
enterprising
and
chivalrous
but
inconsiderate
and
irascible
he
called
bonaparte
monsieur
napoleon
his
follies
and
reverses
in
hanover
were
without
doubt
the
cause
of
his
abdication
on
the
of
october
he
published
a
declaration
of
war
against
france
in
language
highly
insulting
to
the
emperor
fouche
overwhelmed
me
with
letters
if
i
had
attended
to
all
his
instructions
i
should
have
left
nobody
unmolested
he
asked
me
for
information
respecting
a
man
named
lazoret
of
the
department
of
gard
a
girl
named
rosine
zimbenni
having
informed
the
police
that
he
had
been
killed
in
a
duel
at
hamburg
i
replied
that
i
knew
but
of
four
frenchmen
who
had
been
killed
in
that
way
one
named
clement
was
killed
by
tarasson
a
second
named
duparc
killed
by
lezardi
a
third
named
sadremont
killed
by
revel
and
a
fourth
whose
name
i
did
not
know
killed
by
lafond
this
latter
had
just
arrived
at
hamburg
when
he
was
killed
but
he
was
not
the
man
sought
for
lafond
was
a
native
of
brabant
and
had
served
in
the
british
army
he
insulted
the
frenchman
because
he
wore
the
national
cockade
a
duel
was
the
consequence
and
the
offended
party
fell
reinhart
my
predecessor
wished
to
punish
lafond
but
the
austrian
minister
having
claimed
him
as
the
subject
of
his
sovereign
he
was
not
molested
lafond
took
refuge
in
antwerp
where
he
became
a
player
during
the
first
months
which
succeeded
my
arrival
in
hamburg
i
received
orders
for
the
arrest
of
many
persons
almost
all
of
whom
were
designated
as
dangerous
and
ill
disposed
men
when
i
was
convinced
that
the
accusation
was
groundless
i
postponed
the
arrest
the
matter
was
then
forgotten
and
nobody
complained
a
title
or
a
rank
in
foreign
service
was
a
safeguard
against
the
paris
inquisition
of
this
the
following
is
an
instance
count
gimel
of
whom
i
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
speak
more
at
length
set
out
about
this
time
for
carlsbad
count
grote
the
prussian
minister
frequently
spoke
to
me
of
him
on
my
expressing
apprehension
that
de
gimel
might
be
arrested
as
there
was
a
strong
prejudice
against
him
grote
replied
oh
there
is
no
fear
of
that
he
will
return
to
hamburg
with
the
rauk
of
an
english
colonel
on
the
of
july
there
appeared
in
the
correspondent
an
article
exceedingly
insulting
to
france
it
had
been
inserted
by
order
of
baron
novozilzow
who
was
at
berlin
and
who
had
become
very
hostile
to
france
though
it
was
said
he
had
been
sent
from
petersburg
on
a
specific
mission
to
napoleon
the
article
in
question
was
transmitted
from
berlin
by
an
extraordinary
courier
and
novozilzow
in
his
note
to
the
senate
said
it
might
be
stated
that
the
article
was
inserted
at
the
request
of
his
britannic
majesty
the
russian
minister
at
berlin
alopaeus
despatched
also
an
to
the
russian
charge
at
hamburg
with
orders
to
apply
for
the
insertion
of
the
article
which
accordingly
appeared
in
obedience
to
the
emperor
instructions
i
complained
of
it
and
the
senate
replied
that
it
never
opposed
the
insertion
of
an
official
note
sent
by
any
government
that
insults
would
redound
against
those
from
whom
they
came
that
the
reply
of
the
french
government
would
be
published
and
that
the
senate
had
never
deviated
from
this
mode
of
proceeding
i
observed
to
the
senate
that
i
did
not
understand
why
the
correspondent
should
make
itself
the
trumpet
of
novozilzow
to
which
the
syndic
replied
that
two
great
powers
which
might
do
them
much
harm
had
required
the
insertion
of
the
article
and
that
it
could
not
be
refused
the
hatred
felt
by
the
foreign
princes
which
the
death
of
the
duc
had
considerably
increased
gave
encouragement
to
the
publication
of
everything
hostile
to
napoleon
this
was
candidly
avowed
to
me
by
the
ministers
and
foreigners
of
rank
whom
i
saw
in
hamburg
the
king
of
sweden
was
most
violent
in
manifesting
the
indignation
which
was
generally
excited
by
the
death
of
the
due
wetterstadt
who
had
succeeded
la
gerbielske
in
the
cabinet
of
stockholm
sent
to
the
swedish
minister
at
hamburg
a
long
letter
exceedingly
insulting
to
napoleon
it
was
in
reply
to
an
article
inserted
in
the
respecting
the
return
of
the
black
eagle
to
the
king
of
prussia
peyron
the
swedish
minister
at
hamburg
who
was
very
far
from
approving
all
that
his
master
did
transmitted
to
stockholm
some
very
energetic
remarks
on
the
ill
effect
which
would
be
produced
by
the
insertion
of
the
article
in
the
the
article
was
then
a
little
modified
and
peyron
received
formal
orders
to
get
it
inserted
however
on
my
representations
the
senate
agreed
to
suppress
it
and
it
did
not
appear
marshal
bernadotte
who
had
the
command
of
the
french
troops
in
hanover
kept
up
a
friendly
correspondence
with
me
unconnected
with
the
duties
of
our
respective
functions
on
the
occupation
of
hanover
taylor
the
english
minister
at
cassel
was
obliged
to
leave
that
place
but
he
soon
returned
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
france
on
this
subject
the
marshal
furnished
me
with
the
following
particulars
i
have
just
received
my
dear
bourrienne
information
which
leaves
no
doubt
of
what
has
taken
place
at
cassel
with
respect
to
taylor
that
minister
has
been
received
in
spite
of
the
representations
of
bignon
which
however
had
previously
been
merely
verbal
i
know
that
the
elector
wrote
to
london
to
request
that
taylor
should
not
return
in
answer
to
this
the
english
government
sent
him
back
our
minister
has
done
everything
he
could
to
obtain
his
dismissal
but
the
pecuniary
interests
of
the
elector
have
triumphed
over
every
other
consideration
he
would
not
risk
quarrelling
with
the
court
from
which
he
expects
to
receive
more
than
francs
the
british
government
has
been
written
to
a
second
time
but
without
effect
the
elector
himself
in
a
private
letter
has
requested
the
king
of
england
to
recall
taylor
but
it
is
very
probable
that
the
cabinet
of
london
will
evade
this
request
under
these
circumstances
our
troops
have
approached
nearer
to
cassel
hitherto
the
whole
district
of
gottingen
had
been
exempt
from
quartering
troops
new
arrangements
tendered
necessary
by
the
scarcity
of
forage
have
obliged
me
to
send
a
squadron
of
de
cheval
to
munden
a
little
town
four
leagues
from
cassel
this
movement
excited
some
alarm
in
the
elector
who
expressed
a
wish
to
see
things
restored
to
the
same
footing
as
before
he
has
requested
bignon
to
write
to
me
and
to
assure
me
again
that
he
will
be
delighted
to
become
acquainted
with
me
at
the
waters
of
nemidorff
where
he
intends
to
spend
some
time
but
on
this
subject
i

persons

had

knowing
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
political

had
read
this
treaty

principal
points
of
which
were
communicated
to

article
stated
that
the
object
of
the
alliance
was
to
restore
the
balance
of
europe
by
art
the
emperor
of
russia
was
to
place
men
at
the
disposal
of
england
art
stipulated
that
neither
of
the
two
powers
would
consent
to
treat
with
france
nor
to
lay
down
arms
until
the
king
of

should
either
be
restored

malta

by
art
the
two
powers
were
to
guarantee
the
independence
of
the
republic
of
the
ionian
isles
and
england
was
to
pledge
herself
to
assist
russia
in
her
war
against
persia
if
this
plan
of
a
treaty
of
the
existence
of
which
i
was
informed
on
unquestionable
authority
had
been
brought
to
any
result
it
is
impossible
to
calculate
what
might
have
been
its
consequences
at
that
time
an
immediate
continental
war
was
confidently
expected
by
every
person
in
the
north
of
europe
and
it
is
very
certain
that
had
not
napoleon
taken
the
hint
in
time
and
renounced
his
absurd
schemes
at
boulogne
france
would
have
stood
in
a
dangerous
situation
forshmann
the
russian
charge
was
intriguing
to
excite
the
north
of
europe
against
france
he
repeatedly
received
orders
to
obtain
the
insertion
of
irritating
articles
in
the
he
was
an
active
intriguing
and
spiteful
little
man
and
a
declared
enemy
of
france
but
fortunately
his
stupidity
and
vanity
rendered
him
less
dangerous
than
he
wished
to
be
he
was
universally
detested
and
he
would
have
lost
all
credit
but
that
the
extensive
trade
carried
on
between
russia
and
hamburg
forced
the
inhabitants
and
magistrates
of
that
city
to
bear
with
a
man
who
might
have
done
them
individually
considerable
injury
the
recollection
of
duroc
successful
mission
to
berlin
during
the
consulate
induced
napoleon
to
believe
that
that
general
might
appease
the
king
of
prussia
who
complained
seriously
of
the
violation
of
the
territory
of
anspach
which
bernadotte
in
consequence
of
the
orders
he
received
had
not
been
able
to
respect
duroc
remained
about
six
weeks
in
berlin
the
following
letter
from
duroc
will
show
that
the
facility
of
passing
through
hesse
seemed
to
excuse
the
second
violation
of
the
prussian
territory
but
there
was
a
great
difference
between
a
petty
prince
of
hesse
and
the
king
of
prussia
i
send
you
my
dear
bourrienne
two
despatches
which
i
have
received
for
you
de
talleyrand
who
sends
them
desires
me
to
request
that
you
will
transmit
general
victor
by
a
sure
conveyance
i
do
not
yet
know
whether
i
shall
stay
long
in
berlin
by
the
last
accounts
i
received
the
emperor
is
still
in
paris
and
numerous
forces
are
assembling
on
the
rhine
the
hopes
of
peace
are
vanishing
every
day
and
austria
does
everything
to
promote
war
i
have
received
accounts
from
marshal
bernadotte
he
has
effected
his
passage
through
hesse
marshal
bernadotte
was
much
pleased
with
the
courtesy
he
experienced
from
the
elector
the
junction
of
the
corps
commanded
by
bernadotte
with
the
army
of
the
emperor
was
very
important
and
napoleon
therefore
directed
the
marshal
to
come
up
with
him
as
speedily
as
possible
and
by
the
shortest
road
it
was
necessary
he
should
arrive
in
time
for
the
battle
of
austerlitz
gustavus
king
of
sweden
who
was
always
engaged
in
some
enterprise
wished
to
raise
an
army
composed
of
swedes
prussians
and
english
and
certainly
a
vigorous
attack
in
the
north
would
have
prevented
bernadotte
from
quitting
the
banks
of
the
elbe
and
the
weser
and
reinforcing
the
grand
army
which
was
marching
on
vienna
but
the
king
of
coalition
produced
no
other
result
than
the
siege
of
the
little
fortress
of
hameln
prussia
would
not
come
to
a
rupture
with
france
the
king
of
sweden
was
abandoned
and
bonaparte
resentment
against
him
increased
this
abortive
project
of
gustavus
contributed
not
a
little
to
alienate
the
affections
of
his
subjects
who
feared
that
they
might
be
the
victims
of
the
revenge
excited
by
the
extravagant
plans
of
their
king
and
the
insults
he
had
heaped
upon
napoleon
particularly
since
the
death
of
the
due
on
the
of
september
i
received
a
letter
from
the
minister
of
police
soliciting
information
about
swedish
pomerania
astonished
at
not
obtaining
from
the
commercial
consuls
at
lubeck
and
stettin
any
accounts
of
the
movements
of
the
russians
i
had
sent
to
those
ports
four
days
before
the
receipt
of
the
police
letter
a
confidential
agent
to
observe
the
baltic
though
we
were
only
leagues
from
stralsund
the
most
uncertain
and
contradictory
accounts
came
to
hand
it
was
however
certain
that
a
landing
of
the
russians
was
expected
at
stralsund
or
at
travemtinde
the
port
of
lubeck
at
the
mouth
of
the
little
river
trave
i
was
positively
informed
that
russia
had
freighted
a
considerable
number
of
vessels
for
those
ports
the
hatred
of
the
french
continued
to
increase
in
the
north
of
europe
about
the
end
of
september
there
appeared
at
kiel
in
denmark
a
libellous
pamphlet
which
was
bought
and
read
with
inconceivable
avidity
this
pamphlet
which
was
very
ably
written
was
the
production
of
some
fanatic
who
openly
preached
a
crusade
against
france
the
author
regarded
the
blood
of
millions
of
men
as
a
trifling
sacrifice
for
the
great
object
of
humiliating
france
and
bringing
her
back
to
the
limits
of
the
old
monarchy
this
pamphlet
was
circulated
extensively
in
the
german
departments
united
to
france
in
holland
and
in
switzerland
the
number
of
incendiary
publications
which
everywhere
abounded
indicated
but
too
plainly
that
if
the
nations
of
the
north
should
be
driven
back
towards
the
arctic
regions
they
would
in
their
turn
repulse
their
conquerors
towards
the
south
and
no
man
of
common
sense
could
doubt
that
if
the
french
eagles
were
planted
in
foreign
capitals
foreign
standards
would
one
day
wave
over
paris
on
the
of
september
i
received
by
an
intelligence
of
the
landing
at
stralsund
of
swedes
who
had
arrived
from
stockholm
in
two
ships
of
war
about
the
end
of
september
the
hamburg
exchange
on
paris
fell
alarmingly
the
loss
was
twenty
per
cent
the
fall
stopped
at
seventeen
below
par
the
speculation
for
this
fall
of
the
exchange
had
been
made
with
equal
imprudence
and
animosity
by
the
house
of
osy
and
company
the
head
of
that
house
a
dutch
emigrant
who
had
been
settled
at
hamburg
about
six
years
seized
every
opportunity
of
manifesting
his
hatred
of
france
an
agent
of
that
rich
house
at
rotterdam
was
also
very
hostile
to
us
a
circumstance
which
shows
that
if
many
persons
sacrifice
their
political
opinions
to
their
interests
there
are
others
who
endanger
their
interests
for
the
triumph
of
their
opinions
on
the
of
october
i
received
official
intelligence
of
the
total
destruction
of
the
first
austrian
army
general
barbou
who
was
in
hanover
also
informed
me
of
that
event
in
the
following
terms
the
first
austrian
army
has
ceased
to
exist
he
alluded
to
the
brilliant
affair
of
ulm
i
immediately
despatched
twelve
estafettes
to
different
parts
among
other
places
to
stralsund
and
husum
i
thought
that
these
prodigies
which
must
have
been
almost
incredible
to
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
napoleon
military
genius
might
arrest
the
progress
of
the
russian
troops
and
produces
some
change
in
the
movements
of
the
enemy
forces
a
second
edition
of
the
was
published
with
this
intelligence
and
copies
were
sold
at
four
times
the
usual
price
i
need
not
detain
the
reader
with
the
details
of
the
capitulation
of
ulm
which
have
already
been
published
but
i
may
relate
the
following
anecdote
which
is
not
generally
known
a
french
general
passing
before
the
ranks
of
his
men
said
to
them
well
comrades
we
have
prisoners
enough
here
yes
indeed
replied
one
of
the
soldiers
we
never
saw
so
many
collected
together
before
it
was
stated
at
the
time
and
i
believe
it
that
the
emperor
was
much
displeased
when
he
heard
of
this
and
remarked
that
it
was
atrocious
to
insult
brave
men
to
whom
the
fate
of
arms
had
proved
unfavourable
in
reading
the
history
of
this
period
we
find
that
in
whatever
place
napoleon
happened
to
be
there
was
the
central
point
of
action
the
affairs
of
europe
were
arranged
at
his
headquarters
in
the
same
manner
as
if
he
had
been
in
paris
everything
depended
on
his
good
or
bad
fortune
espionage
seduction
false
promises
exactions
all
were
put
in
force
to
promote
the
success
of
his
projects
but
his
despotism
which
excited
dissatisfaction
in
france
and
his
continual
aggressions
which
threatened
the
independence
of
foreign
states
rendered
him
more
and
more
unpopular
everywhere
the
battle
of
trafalgar
took
place
while
napoleon
was
marching
on
vienna
and
on
the
day
after
the
capitulation
of
ulm
the
southern
coast
of
spain
then
witnessed
an
engagement
between
french
and
about
an
equal
number
of
english
ships
and
in
spite
of
this
equality
of
force
the
french
fleet
was
the
actual
forces
present
were
english
ships
of
the
line
and
ships
of
the
line
see

vol

p
this
great
battle
afforded
another
proof
of
our
naval
inferiority
admires
calder
first
gave
us
the
lesson
which
nelson
completed
but
which
cost
the
latter
his
life
according
to
the
reports
which
duroc
transmitted
to
me
courage
gave
momentary
hope
to
the
french
but
they
were
at
length
forced
to
yield
to
the
superior
naval
tactics
of
the
enemy
the
battle
of
trafalgar
paralysed
our
naval
force
and
banished
all
hope
of
any
attempt
against
england
the
favour
which
the
king
of
prussia
had
shown
to
duroc
was
withdrawn
when
his
majesty
received
intelligence
of
the
march
of
troops
through
the
margravate
of
anspach
all
accounts
concurred
respecting
the
just
umbrage
which
that
violation
of
territory
occasioned
to
the
king
of
prussia
the
agents
whom
i
had
in
that
quarter
overwhelmed
me
with
reports
of
the
excesses
committed
by
the
french
in
passing
through
the
margravate
a
letter
i
received
from
duroc
contains
the
following
remarks
on
this
subject
the
corps
of
marshal
bernadotte
has
passed
through
anapach
and
by
some
misunderstanding
this
has
been
regarded
at
berlin
as
an
insult
to
the
king
a
violence
committed
upon
his
neutrality
how
can
it
be
supposed
especially
under
present
circumstances
that
the
emperor
could
have
any
intention
of
insulting
or
committing
violence
upon
his
friend
besides
the
reports
have
been
exaggerated
and
have
been
made
by
persons
who
wish
to
favour
our
enemies
rather
than
us
however
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
marshal
bernadotte
men
are
not
virgins
be
this
as
it
may
the
business
might
have
been
fatal
and
will
at
all
events
be
very
injurious
to
us
laforeat
and
i
are
treated
very
harshly
though
we
do
not
deserve
it
all
the
idle
stories
that
have
been
got
up
here
must
have
reached
you
probably
prussia
will
not
forget
that
france
was
and
still
may
be
the
only
power
interested
in
her
glory
and
aggrandisement
at
the
end
of
october
the
king
of
prussia
far
from
thinking
of
war
but
in
case
of
its
occurrence
wishing
to
check
its
disasters
as
far
as
possible
proposed
to
establish
a
line
of
neutrality
this
was
the
first
idea
of
the
confederation
of
the
north
duroc
fearing
lest
the
russians
should
enter
hamburg
advised
me
as
a
friend
to
adopt
precautions
but
i
was
on
the
spot
i
knew
all
the
movement
the
little
detached
corps
and
i
was
under
no
apprehension
the
editor
of
the
hamburg
sent
me
every
evening
a
proof
of
the
number
which
was
to
appear
next
day
a
favour
which
was
granted
only
to
the
french
minister
on
the
of
november
i
received
the
proof
as
usual
and
saw
nothing
objectionable
in
it
how
great
therefore
was
my
astonishment
when
next
morning
i
read
in
the
same
journal
an
article
personally
insulting
to
the
emperor
and
in
which
the
legitimate
sovereigns
of
europe
were
called
upon
to
undertake
a
crusade
against
the
usurper
etc
i
immediately
sent
for
doormann
first
syndic
of
the
senate
of
hamburg
when
he
appeared
his
mortified
look
sufficiently
informed
me
that
he
knew
what
i
had
to
say
to
him
i
reproached
him
sharply
and
asked
him
how
after
all
i
had
told
him
of
the
emperor
susceptibility
he
could
permit
the
insertion
of
such
an
article
i
observed
to
him
that
this
indecorous
diatribe
had
no
official
character
since
it
had
no
signature
and
that
therefore
he
had
acted
in
direct
opposition
to
a
decree
of
the
senate
which
prohibited
the
insertion
in
the
journals
of
any
articles
which
were
not
signed
i
told
him
plainly
that
his
imprudence
might
be
attended
with
serious
consequences
doormann
did
not
attempt
to
justify
himaelt
but
merely
explained
to
me
how
the
thing
had
happened
on
the
of
november
in
the
evening
forshmann
the
russian
charge
who
had
in
the
course
of
the
day
arrived
from
the
russian
headquarters
presented
to
the
editor
of
the
correspondent
the
article
in
question
the
editor
after
reading
the
article
which
he
thought
exceedingly
indecorous
observed
to
forshmann
that
his
paper
was
already
made
up
which
was
the
fact
for
i
had
seen
a
proof
forshmann
however
insisted
on
the
insertion
of
the
article
the
editor
then
told
him
that
he
could
not
admit
it
without
the
approbation
of
the
syndic
censor
forshmann
immediately
waited
upon
doormann
and
when
the
latter
begged
that
he
would
not
insist
on
the
insertion
of
the
article
forshmann
produced
a
letter
written
in
french
which
among
other
things
contained
the
following
you
will
get
the
enclosed
article
inserted
in
the
correspondent
without
suffering
a
single
word
to
be
altered
should
the
censor
refuse
you
must
apply
to
the
directing
burgomaster
and
in
case
of
his
refusal
to
general
tolstoy
who
will
devise
some
means
of
rendering
the
senate
more
complying
and
forcing
it
to
observe
an
impartial
deference
doorman
thinking
he
could
not
take
upon
himself
to
allow
the
insertion
of
the
article
went
accompanied
by
forshmann
to
wait
upon
von
graffen
the
directing
burgomaster
mm
doorman
and
von
graffen
earnestly
pointed
out
the
impropriety
of
inserting
the
article
but
forshmann
referred
to
his
order
and
added
that
the
compliance
of
the
senate
on
this
point
was
the
only
means
of
avoiding
great
mischief
the
burgomaster
and
the
syndic
finding
themselves
thus
forced
to
admit
the
article
entreated
that
the
following
passage
at
least
might
be
suppressed
i
know
a
certain
chief
who
in
defiance
of
all
laws
divine
and
human
in
contempt
of
the
hatred
he
inspires
in
europe
as
well
as
among
those
whom
he
has
reduced
to
be
his
subjects
keeps
possession
of
a
usurped
throne
by
violence
and
crime
his
insatiable
ambition
would
subject
all
europe
to
his
rule
but
the
time
is
come
for
avenging
the
rights
of
nations
forshmann
again
referred
to
his
orders
and
with
some
degree
of
violence
insisted
on
the
insertion
of
the
article
in
its
complete
form
the
burgomaster
then
authorised
the
editor
of
the
correspondent
to
print
the
article
that
night
and
forshmann
having
obtained
that
authority
carried
the
article
to
the
office
at
eleven
such
was
the
account
given
me
by
doormann
i
observed
that
i
did
not
understand
how
the
imaginary
apprehension
of
any
violence
on
the
part
of
russia
should
have
induced
him
to
admit
so
insolent
an
attack
upon
the
most
powerful
sovereign
in
europe
whose
arms
would
soon
dictate
laws
to
germany
the
syndic
did
not
dissemble
his
fear
of
the
resentment
while
at
the
same
time
he
expressed
a
hope
that
the
emperor
would
take
into
consideration
the
extreme
difficulty
of
a
small
power
maintaining
neutrality
in
the
extraordinary
circumstances
in
which
hamburg
was
placed
and
that
the
articles
might
be
said
to
have
been
presented
almost
at
the
point
of
the
cossacks
spears
doormann
added
that
a
refusal
which
world
have
brought
russian
troops
to
hamburg
might
have
been
attended
by
very
unpleasant
consequences
to
me
and
might
have
committed
the
senate
in
a
very
different
way
i
begged
of
him
once
for
all
to
set
aside
in
these
affairs
all
consideration
of
my
personal
danger
and
the
syndic
after
a
conversation
of
more
than
two
hours
departed
more
uneasy
in
his
mind
than
when
he
arrived
and
conjuring
me
to
give
a
faithful
report
of
the
facts
as
they
had
happened
doormann
was
a
very
worthy
man
and
i
gave
a
favourable
representation
of
his
excuses
and
of
the
readiness
which
he
had
always
evinced
to
keep
out
of
the
correspondent
articles
hostile
to
france
as
for
example
the
commencement
of
a
proclamation
of
the
emperor
of
germany
to
his
subjects
and
a
complete
proclamation
of
the
king
of
sweden
as
it
happened
the
good
syndic
escaped
with
nothing
worse
than
a
fright
i
was
myself
astonished
at
the
success
of
my
intercession
i
learned
from
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
that
the
emperor
was
furiously
indignant
on
reading
the
article
in
which
the
french
army
was
outraged
as
well
as
he
indeed
he
paid
but
little
attention
to
insults
directed
against
himself
personally
their
eternal
repetition
had
inured
him
to
them
but
at
the
idea
of
his
army
being
insulted
he
was
violently
enraged
and
uttered
the
most
terrible
threats
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
the
swedish
and
english
ministers
as
soon
as
they
read
the
article
waited
upon
the
editor
of
the
correspondent
and
expressed
their
astonishment
that
such
a
libel
should
have
been
published
victorious
armies
said
they
should
be
answered
by
cannonballs
and
not
by
insults
as
gross
as
they
are
ridiculous

opinion
was

by

the

early
part

events
succeeded
each
other
with
such
incredible
rapidity
as
to
render
my
labour
excessive
my
occupations
were
different
but
not
less
laborious
than
those
which
i
formerly
performed
when
near
the
emperor
and
besides
i
was
now
loaded
with
a
responsibility
which
did
not
attach
to
me
as
the
private
secretary
of
general
bonaparte
and
the
first
consul
i
had
in
fact
to
maintain
a
constant
watch
over
the
emigrants
in
altona
which
was
no
easy
matter
to
correspond
daily
with
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
the
minister
of
police
to
confer
with
the
foreign
ministers
accredited
at
hamburg
to
maintain
active
relations
with
the
commanders
of
the
french
army
to
interrogate
my
secret
agents
and
keep
a
strict
surveillance
over
their
proceedings
it
was
besides
necessary
to
be
unceasingly
on
the
watch
for
scurrilous
articles
against
napoleon
in
the
hamburg
i
shall
frequently
have
occasion
to
speak
of
all
these
things
and
especially
of
the
most
marked
emigrants
in
a
manner
less
irregular
because
what
i
have
hitherto
said
may
in
some
sort
be
considered
merely
as
a
summary
of
all
the
facts
relating
to
the
occurrences
which
daily
passed
before
my
eyes
in
the
midst
of
these
multifarious
and
weighty
occupations
i
received
a
packet
with
the
strasburg
postmark
at
the
time
the
empress
was
in
that
city
this
packet
had
not
the
usual
form
of
a
diplomatic
despatch
and
the
superscription
announced
that
it
came
from
the
residence
of
josephine
my
readers
i
venture
to
presume
will
not
experience
less
gratification
than
i
did
on
a
perusal
of
its
contents
which
will
be
found
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
but
before
satisfying
the
curiosity
to
which
i
have
perhaps
given
birth
i
may
here
relate
that
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
bonaparte
was
a
fondness
of
extempore
narration
and
it
appears
he
had
not
discontinued
the
practice
even
after
he
became
emperor
in
fact
bonaparte
during
the
first
year
after
his
elevation
to
the
imperial
throne
usually
passed
those
evenings
in
the
apartments
of
the
empress
which
he
could
steal
from
public
business
throwing
himself
on
a
sofa
he
would
remain
absorbed
in
gloomy
silence
which
no
one
dared
to
interrupt
sometimes
however
on
the
contrary
he
would
give
the
reins
to
his
vivid
imagination
and
his
love
of
the
marvelous
or
to
speak
more
correctly
his
desire
to
produce
effect
which
was
perhaps
one
of
his
strongest
passions
and
would
relate
little
romances
which
were
always
of
a
fearful
description
and
in
unison
with
the
natural
turn
of
his
ideas
during
those
recitals
the
were
always
present
to
one
of
whom
i
am
indebted
for
the
following
story
which
she
had
written
nearly
in
the
words
of
napoleon
never
said
this
lady
in
her
letter
to
me
did
the
emperor
appear
more
extraordinary
led
away
by
the
subject
he
paced
the
salon
with
hasty
strides
the
intonations
of
his
voice
varied
according
to
the
characters
of
the
personages
he
brought
on
the
scene
he
seemed
to
multiply
himself
in
order
to
play
the
different
parts
and
no
person
needed
to
feign
the
terror
which
he
really
inspired
and
which
he
loved
to
see
depicted
in
the
countenances
of
those
who
surrounded
him
in
this
tale
i
have
made
no
alterations
as
can
be
attested
by
those
who
to
my
knowledge
have
a
copy
of
it
it
is
curious
to
compare
the
impassioned
portions
of
it
with
the
style
of
