introduction
the
origins
of
this
extraordinary
book
are
sufficiently
curious
and
sufficiently
interesting
to
be
stated
in
detail
they
go
back
to
some
ten
years
ago
when
the
author
after
the
rustic
adventures
which
she
describes
in
the
following
pages
had
definitely
settled
in
paris
as
a
working
sempstress
the
existence
of
a
working
sempstress
in
paris
as
elsewhere
is
very
hard
it
usually
means
eleven
hours
close
application
a
day
six
full
days
a
week
at
half
a
crown
a
day
but
already
marguerite
audoux
defective
eyesight
was
causing
anxiety
and
upsetting
the
regularity
of
her
work
so
that
in
the
evenings
she
was
often
less
fatigued
than
a
sempstress
generally
is
she
wanted
distraction
and
she
found
it
in
the
realization
of
an
old
desire
to
write
she
wrote
not
because
she
could
find
nothing
else
to
do
but
because
at
last
the
chance
of
writing
had
come
that
she
had
always
loved
reading
is
plain
from
certain
incidents
in
this
present
book
her
opportunities
for
reading
however
had
been
limited
she
now
began
in
a
tentative
and
perhaps
desultory
fashion
to
set
down
her
youthful
reminiscences
about
this
time
she
became
acquainted
through
one
of
its
members
and
by
one
of
those
hazards
of
destiny
which
too
rarely
diversify
the
dull
industrial
life
of
a
city
with
a
circle
of
young
literary
men
of
whom
possibly
the
most
important
was
the
regretted
charles
louis
philippe
author
of
bubu
de
montparnasse
and
other
novels
which
have
a
genuine
reputation
among
the
chosen
people
who
know
the
difference
between
literature
and
its
counterfeit
this
circle
of
friends
used
to
meet
at
philippe
flat
it
included
a
number
of
talented
writers
among
whom
i
should
mention
mm
iehl
the
author
of
cauët
francis
jourdain
paul
fargue
larbaud
chanvin
marcel
ray
and
régis
gignoux
the
literary
and
dramatic
critic
marguerite
audoux
was
not
introduced
as
a
literary
prodigy
nobody
indeed
was
aware
that
she
wrote
she
came
on
her
merits
as
an
individuality
and
she
took
her
place
beside
several
other
women
who
like
herself
had
no
literary
pretensions
i
am
told
by
one
of
the
intimates
of
the
fellowship
that
the
impression
she
made
was
profound
and
the
fact
is
indubitable
that
her
friends
are
at
least
as
enthusiastic
about
her
individuality
as
about
this
book
which
she
has
written
she
was
a
little
over
thirty
and
very
pretty
with
an
agreeable
voice
the
sobriety
of
her
charm
the
clear
depth
of
her
emotional
faculty
and
the
breadth
of
her
gentle
interest
in
human
nature
handsomely
conquered
the
entire
fellowship
the
working
sempstress
was
sincerely
esteemed
by
some
of
the
brightest
masculine
intellects
in
paris
this
admiring
appreciation
naturally
encouraged
her
to
speak
a
little
of
herself
and
one
evening
she
confessed
that
she
too
had
been
trying
to
write
on
another
evening
she
brought
some
sheets
of
manuscript
the
draft
of
the
early
chapters
of
marie
claire
and
read
them
aloud
she
read
i
am
told
very
well
the
reception
was
enthusiastic
one
can
imagine
the
ecstatic
fervour
of
these
young
men
startled
by
the
apparition
of
such
a
shining
talent
she
must
continue
the
writing
of
her
book
but
in
the
mean
time
she
must
produce
some
short
stories
and
sketches
for
the
daily
papers
her
gift
must
be
presented
to
the
public
instantly
she
followed
the
advice
thus
urgently
offered
and
several
members
of
the
circle
in
particular
régis
gignoux
and
marcel
ray
gave
themselves
up
to
the
business
of
placing
the
stories
and
sketches
marcel
ray
devoted
whole
days
to
the
effort
obtaining
special
leave
from
his
own
duties
in
order
to
do
so
in
the
result
several
stories
and
sketches
appeared
in
the
paris
respectively
the
least
and
the
most
literary
of
paris
morning
papers
and
other
organs
these
stories
and
sketches
by
the
way
were
republished
in
a
small
volume
some
time
before
marie
claire
and
attracted
no
general
attention
whatever
meanwhile
the
more
important
work
proceeded
slowly
and
was
at
length
finished
its
composition
stretched
over
a
period
of
six
years
marguerite
audoux
never
hurried
nor
fatigued
herself
and
though
she
many
passages
several
times
she
did
not
carry
this
revision
to
the
meticulous
excess
which
is
the
ruin
of
so
many
ardent
literary
beginners
in
france
the
trite
phrase
written
with
blood
and
tears
does
not
in
the
least
apply
here
a
native
wisdom
has
invariably
saved
marguerite
audoux
from
the
dangerous
extreme
in
his
preface
to
the
original
french
edition
octave
mirbeau
appositely
points
out
that
philippe
and
her
other
friends
abstained
from
giving
purely
literary
advice
to
the
authoress
as
her
book
grew
and
was
read
aloud
with
the
insight
of
artists
they
perceived
that
hers
was
a
talent
which
must
be
strictly
let
alone
but
parisian
rumour
has
alleged
not
merely
that
she
was
advised
but
that
she
was
actually
helped
in
the
writing
by
her
admirers
the
rumour
is
worse
than
false
it
is
silly
every
paragraph
of
the
work
bears
the
unmistakable
and
inimitable
work
of
one
individuality
and
among
the
friends
of
marguerite
audoux
even
the
most
gifted
there
is
none
who
could
possibly
have
composed
any
of
the
passages
which
have
been
singled
out
as
being
beyond
the
accomplishment
of
a
working
sempstress
the
whole
work
and
every
part
of
the
work
is
the
unassisted
and
untutored
production
of
its
author
this
statement
can
not
be
too
clearly
and
positively
made
doubtless
the
spelling
was
drastically
corrected
by
the
but
to
have
one
spelling
drastically
corrected
is
an
experience
which
occurs
to
nearly
all
women
writers
and
to
a
few
male
writers
the
book
completed
the
question
of
its
proper
flotation
arose
i
use
the
word
flotation
with
intent
although
marguerite
audoux
had
originally
no
thought
of
publishing
her
friends
were
firmly
bent
not
simply
on
publishing
but
on
publishing
with
the
maximum
of
éclat
a
great
name
was
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
enterprise
a
name
which
while
keeping
the
sympathy
of
the
artists
would
impose
itself
on
the
crowd
francis
jourdain
knew
octave
mirbeau
and
octave
mirbeau
by
virtue
of
his
feverish
artistic
and
moral
enthusiasms
of
his
notorious
generosity
and
of
his
enormous
vogue
was
obviously
the
man
francis
jourdain
went
to
octave
mirbeau
and
offered
him
the
privilege
of
floating
marie
claire
on
the
literary
market
of
paris
octave
mirbeau
accepted
and
he
went
to
work
on
the
business
as
he
goes
to
work
on
all
his
business
that
is
to
say
with
flames
and
lightnings
for
some
time
octave
mirbeau
lived
for
nothing
but
marie
claire
the
result
has
been
vastly
creditable
to
him
marie
claire
was
finally
launched
in
splendour
its
path
had
been
prepared
with
really
remarkable
skill
in
the
press
and
in
the
world
and
it
was
an
exceedingly
brilliant
success
from
the
start
it
ran
a
triumphant
course
as
a
serial
in
one
of
the
great
reviews
and
within
a
few
weeks
of
its
publication
as
a
book
thirty
thousand
copies
had
been
sold
the
sale
continues
more
actively
than
ever
marguerite
audoux
lives
precisely
as
she
lived
before
she
is
writing
a
further
instalment
of
her
pseudonymous
autobiography
and
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
this
new
instalment
should
not
be
even
better
than
the
first
such
is
the
story
of
the
book
my
task
is
not
to
criticise
the
work
i
will
only
say
this
in
my
opinion
it
is
highly
distinguished
of
its
kind
the
second
part
in
particular
is
full
of
marvellous
beauty
but
it
must
be
accepted
for
what
it
is
it
makes
no
sort
of
pretence
to
display
those
constructive
and
inventive
artifices
which
are
indispensable
to
a
great
masterpiece
of
impersonal
fiction
it
is
not
fiction
it
is
the
exquisite
expression
of
a
temperament
it
is
a
divine
accident
arnold
bennett
marie
claire
part
i
one
day
a
number
of
people
came
to
the
house
the
men
came
in
as
though
they
were
going
into
church
and
the
women
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
they
went
out
i
slipped
into
my
parents
bedroom
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
my
mother
had
a
big
lighted
candle
by
her
bedside
my
father
was
leaning
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
looking
at
my
mother
she
was
asleep
with
her
hands
crossed
on
her
breast
our
neighbour
la
mère
colas
kept
us
with
her
all
day
as
the
women
went
out
again
she
said
to
them
no
she
would
not
kiss
her
children
the
women
blew
their
noses
looked
at
us
and
la
mère
colas
added
that
sort
of
illness
makes
one
unkind
i
suppose
a
few
days
afterwards
we
were
given
new
dresses
with
big
black
and
white
checks
la
mère
colas
used
to
give
us
our
meals
and
send
us
out
to
play
in
the
fields
my
sister
who
was
a
big
girl
scrambled
into
the
hedges
climbed
the
trees
messed
about
in
the
ponds
and
used
to
come
home
at
night
with
her
pockets
full
of
creatures
of
all
kinds
which
frightened
me
and
made
la
mère
colas
furiously
angry
what
i
hated
most
were
the
earthworms
the
red
elastic
things
made
me
shiver
with
horror
and
if
i
happened
to
step
on
one
it
made
me
quite
ill
when
i
had
a
pain
in
my
side
la
mère
colas
used
to
forbid
my
sister
to
go
out
but
my
sister
got
tired
of
remaining
indoors
and
wanted
to
go
out
and
take
me
with
her
so
she
used
to
go
and
collect
earthworms
and
hold
them
up
close
to
my
face
then
i
said
that
i
was
in
pain
any
more
and
la
mère
colas
used
to
send
us
both
out
of
doors
one
day
my
sister
threw
a
handful
of
earthworms
on
to
my
dress
i
jumped
back
so
quickly
that
i
fell
into
a
tub
of
hot
water
la
mère
colas
was
very
angry
while
she
undressed
me
i
was
not
very
much
hurt
she
promised
my
sister
a
good
slapping
and
called
to
the
sweeps
who
were
passing
to
come
in
and
take
her
away
all
three
of
them
came
in
with
their
black
bags
and
their
ropes
my
sister
howled
and
cried
for
mercy
i
was
very
much
ashamed
at
being
all
undressed
my
father
often
took
us
to
a
place
where
there
were
men
who
drank
wine
he
used
to
put
me
on
a
table
among
the
glasses
and
make
me
sing
the
men
would
laugh
and
kiss
me
and
try
and
make
me
drink
wine
it
was
always
dark
when
we
went
home
my
father
took
long
steps
and
rocked
himself
as
he
walked
he
nearly
tumbled
down
lots
of
times
sometimes
he
would
begin
to
cry
and
say
that
his
house
had
been
stolen
then
my
sister
used
to
scream
it
was
always
she
who
used
to
find
the
house
one
morning
la
mère
colas
got
angry
with
us
and
told
us
that
we
were
children
of
misfortune
and
that
she
would
not
feed
us
any
longer
she
said
we
could
go
and
look
for
our
father
who
had
gone
away
nobody
knew
where
when
her
anger
had
passed
she
gave
us
our
breakfasts
as
usual
but
a
few
days
afterwards
we
were
put
into
père
chicon
cart
the
cart
was
full
of
straw
and
bags
of
corn
i
was
tucked
away
behind
in
a
little
hollow
between
the
sacks
the
cart
tipped
down
at
the
back
and
every
jolt
made
me
slip
on
the
straw
i
was
very
frightened
all
the
way
along
every
time
i
slipped
i
thought
i
was
going
to
fall
out
of
the
cart
or
that
the
sacks
were
going
to
fall
on
me
we
stopped
at
an
inn
a
woman
lifted
us
down
shook
the
straw
on
our
dresses
and
gave
us
some
milk
to
drink
i
heard
her
say
to
père
chicon
you
really
think
their
father
will
take
care
of
them
then
père
chicon
shook
his
head
and
knocked
his
pipe
against
the
table
then
he
made
a
funny
face
and
said
he
may
be
anywhere
young
girard
told
me
he
had
met
him
on
the
paris
road
after
a
while
père
chicon
took
us
to
a
big
house
with
a
lot
of
steps
leading
up
to
the
door
he
had
a
long
talk
with
a
gentleman
who
waved
his
arms
about
and
talked
about
the
dignity
of
labour
i
wondered
what
that
was
the
gentleman
put
his
hand
on
my
head
and
patted
it
and
i
heard
him
say
several
times
he
did
not
tell
me
that
he
had
any
children
i
understood
that
he
was
talking
of
my
father
and
i
asked
if
i
could
not
see
him
the
gentleman
looked
at
me
without
answering
and
then
asked
père
chicon
how
old
is
she
about
five
said
père
chicon
all
this
time
my
sister
was
playing
up
and
down
the
steps
with
a
kitten
we
went
back
into
the
cart
and
to
mère
colas
again
she
was
cross
with
us
and
pushed
us
about
a
few
days
afterwards
she
took
us
to
the
railway
station
and
that
evening
we
went
to
a
big
house
where
there
were
a
lot
of
little
girls
sister
gabrielle
separated
us
at
once
she
said
that
my
sister
was
big
enough
to
be
with
the
girls
while
i
was
to
stay
with
the
little
ones
sister
gabrielle
was
quite
small
quite
old
quite
thin
and
all
bent
up
she
managed
the
dormitory
and
the
refectory
she
used
to
make
the
salad
in
a
huge
yellow
jar
she
tucked
her
sleeves
up
to
her
shoulders
and
dipped
her
arms
in
and
out
of
the
salad
her
arms
were
dark
and
knotted
and
when
they
came
out
of
the
jar
all
shining
and
dripping
they
made
me
think
of
dead
branches
on
rainy
days
i
made
a
chum
at
once
she
came
dancing
up
to
me
and
looked
impudent
i
thought
she
did
not
stand
any
higher
than
the
bench
on
which
i
was
sitting
she
put
her
elbows
on
my
knees
and
said
why
are
you
playing
about
i
told
her
that
i
had
a
pain
in
my
side
oh
of
course
she
said
your
mother
had
consumption
and
sister
gabrielle
said
you
would
soon
die
she
climbed
up
on
to
the
bench
and
sat
down
hiding
her
little
legs
underneath
her
then
she
asked
me
my
name
and
my
age
and
told
me
that
her
name
was
ismérie
that
she
was
older
than
i
was
and
that
the
doctor
said
she
would
never
get
any
bigger
she
told
me
also
that
the
class
mistress
was
called
sister
that
she
was
very
unkind
and
punished
you
severely
if
you
talked
too
much
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
jumped
down
and
shouted
augustine
her
voice
was
like
a
boy
voice
and
her
legs
were
a
little
twisted
at
the
end
of
recreation
i
saw
her
on
augustine
back
augustine
was
rolling
her
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
as
if
she
meant
to
throw
her
down
when
she
passed
me
ismérie
said
in
that
big
voice
of
hers
you
will
carry
me
too
sometimes
wo
you
i
soon
became
friends
with
augustine
my
eyes
were
not
well
at
night
my
eyelids
used
to
close
up
tight
and
i
was
quite
blind
until
i
had
them
washed
augustine
was
told
off
to
take
me
to
the
infirmary
she
used
to
come
and
fetch
me
from
the
dormitory
every
morning
i
could
hear
her
coming
before
she
got
to
the
door
she
caught
hold
of
my
hand
and
pulled
me
along
and
she
mind
a
bit
when
i
bumped
against
the
beds
we
flew
down
the
passages
like
the
wind
and
rushed
down
two
flights
of
stairs
like
an
avalanche
my
feet
only
touched
a
step
now
and
again
i
used
to
go
down
those
stairs
as
if
i
was
falling
down
a
well
augustine
had
strong
hands
and
held
me
tight
to
go
to
the
infirmary
we
had
to
pass
behind
the
chapel
and
then
in
front
of
a
little
white
house
there
we
hurried
more
than
ever
one
day
when
i
fell
on
to
my
knees
she
pulled
me
up
again
and
smacked
my
head
saying
do
be
quick
we
are
in
front
of
the
dead
house
after
that
she
was
always
afraid
of
my
falling
again
and
used
to
tell
me
when
we
got
in
front
of
the
dead
house
i
was
frightened
chiefly
because
augustine
was
frightened
if
she
rushed
along
like
that
there
must
be
danger
i
was
always
out
of
breath
when
i
got
to
the
infirmary
somebody
pushed
me
on
to
a
little
chair
and
the
pain
in
my
side
had
been
gone
a
long
time
when
they
came
and
washed
my
eyes
it
was
augustine
who
took
me
into
sister
classroom
she
put
on
a
timid
kind
of
voice
and
said
sister
here
is
a
new
girl
i
expected
to
be
scolded
but
sister
smiled
kissed
me
several
times
and
said
you
are
too
small
to
sit
on
a
bench
i
shall
put
you
in
here
and
she
sat
me
down
on
a
stool
in
the
hollow
of
her
desk
it
was
ever
so
comfortable
in
the
hollow
of
her
desk
and
the
warmth
of
her
woollen
petticoat
soothed
my
body
which
was
bruised
all
over
by
tumbling
about
on
the
wooden
staircases
and
on
the
stone
ones
often
two
feet
hemmed
me
in
on
each
side
of
my
stool
and
two
warm
legs
made
a
back
for
me
a
soft
hand
pressed
my
head
on
to
the
woollen
skirt
between
the
knees
and
the
softness
of
the
hand
and
the
warmth
of
the
pillow
used
to
send
me
to
sleep
when
i
woke
up
again
the
pillow
became
a
table
the
same
hand
put
bits
of
cake
on
it
and
bits
of
sugar
and
sweets
sometimes
and
all
round
me
i
heard
the
world
living
a
voice
with
tears
in
it
would
say
no
sister
i
did
do
it
then
shrill
voices
would
say
yes
she
did
sister
above
my
head
a
full
warm
voice
called
for
silence
and
then
there
would
be
the
rap
of
a
ruler
on
the
desk
it
would
make
an
enormous
noise
down
in
my
hollow
sometimes
the
feet
would
be
drawn
away
from
my
little
stool
the
knees
would
be
drawn
together
the
chair
would
move
and
down
to
my
nest
came
a
white
veil
a
narrow
chin
and
smiling
lips
with
little
white
pointed
teeth
behind
them
and
last
of
all
i
saw
two
soft
eyes
which
seemed
to
cuddle
me
and
make
me
feel
comfortable
when
my
eyes
got
better
i
used
to
get
an
alphabet
as
well
as
sweets
and
cakes
it
was
a
little
book
with
pictures
next
to
the
words
i
often
used
to
look
at
a
great
big
strawberry
which
i
fancied
as
big
as
a
bun
when
it
was
not
cold
in
the
classroom
sister
put
me
on
a
bench
between
ismérie
and
marie
renaud
who
slept
in
the
two
beds
next
to
mine
in
the
dormitory
now
and
then
she
used
to
let
me
go
back
to
my
hollow
again
and
i
loved
that
i
used
to
find
books
there
with
pictures
which
made
me
forget
all
about
the
time
one
morning
ismérie
took
me
into
a
corner
and
told
me
with
great
secrecy
that
sister
was
not
going
to
take
the
class
any
more
she
was
going
to
take
sister
gabrielle
place
in
the
dormitory
and
the
refectory
she
did
not
tell
me
who
had
told
her
this
but
she
said
it
was
an
awful
shame
she
was
very
fond
of
sister
gabrielle
who
used
to
treat
her
like
a
little
child
she
did
not
like
that
sister
as
she
used
to
call
her
when
she
knew
that
nobody
heard
her
but
ourselves
she
said
that
sister
would
not
let
her
climb
on
to
our
backs
and
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
make
fun
of
her
as
we
used
to
of
sister
gabrielle
who
always
went
upstairs
sideways
in
the
evening
after
prayers
sister
gabrielle
told
us
that
she
was
going
she
kissed
us
all
beginning
with
the
smallest
of
us
we
went
up
to
the
dormitory
making
a
dreadful
noise
the
big
girls
whispered
together
and
said
they
would
not
put
up
with
sister
the
little
ones
snivelled
as
though
they
were
going
into
danger
ismérie
whom
i
was
carrying
upstairs
on
my
back
was
crying
noisily
her
little
fingers
hurt
my
throat
and
her
tears
fell
down
my
neck
nobody
thought
of
laughing
at
sister
gabrielle
who
went
upstairs
slowly
saying
hush
hush
all
the
time
without
making
the
noise
any
less
the
servant
in
the
little
dormitory
was
crying
too
she
shook
me
a
little
while
she
was
undressing
me
and
said
i
sure
you
are
pleased
at
having
that
sister
of
yours
we
used
to
call
the
servant
bonne
esther
i
liked
her
best
of
the
three
servants
she
was
rather
rough
sometimes
but
she
was
fond
of
us
when
i
coughed
she
used
to
get
up
and
put
a
piece
of
sugar
in
my
mouth
and
often
she
took
me
out
of
my
bed
when
i
was
cold
and
warmed
me
in
her
own
next
morning
we
went
down
to
the
refectory
in
dead
silence
the
servants
told
us
to
remain
standing
several
of
the
big
girls
stood
very
straight
and
looked
proud
bonne
justine
stood
at
one
end
of
the
table
she
looked
sad
and
bent
her
head
bonne
néron
who
looked
like
a
gendarme
walked
up
and
down
in
the
middle
of
the
refectory
now
and
then
she
looked
at
the
clock
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
sister
came
in
leaving
the
door
open
behind
her
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
taller
than
usual
in
her
white
apron
and
white
cuffs
she
walked
slowly
looking
at
us
all
the
rosary
which
hung
at
her
side
made
a
little
clickety
sound
and
her
skirt
swung
a
little
as
she
walked
she
went
up
the
three
steps
to
her
desk
and
made
a
sign
to
us
to
sit
down
in
the
afternoon
she
took
us
out
for
a
walk
in
the
country
it
was
very
hot
i
went
and
sat
down
near
her
on
a
little
hillock
she
was
reading
a
book
and
every
now
and
then
looked
at
the
little
girls
who
were
playing
in
a
field
below
us
she
looked
at
the
sun
which
was
setting
and
kept
on
saying
how
lovely
it
is
how
lovely
it
is
that
evening
the
birch
which
sister
gabrielle
kept
in
the
dormitory
was
put
away
in
a
cupboard
and
in
the
refectory
the
salad
was
turned
with
two
long
wooden
spoons
these
were
the
only
changes
we
went
into
class
from
nine
till
twelve
and
in
the
afternoon
we
cracked
nuts
which
were
sold
to
an
oil
merchant
the
bigger
girls
used
to
crack
them
with
a
hammer
and
the
little
ones
took
them
out
of
the
shells
we
were
forbidden
to
eat
them
and
it
was
not
easy
anyhow
one
of
the
girls
would
always
sneak
if
we
did
because
she
was
greedy
too
and
jealous
bonne
esther
used
to
peep
into
our
mouths
sometimes
she
caught
a
very
greedy
girl
then
she
used
to
roll
her
eyes
at
her
give
her
a
little
smack
and
say
i
got
my
eye
on
you
some
of
us
she
trusted
she
would
make
us
turn
round
and
open
our
mouths
and
pretend
to
look
at
them
and
then
she
said
shut
your
beaks
birdies
and
laughed
i
often
wanted
to
eat
the
nuts
but
i
would
look
at
bonne
esther
and
blush
at
the
idea
of
cheating
her
because
she
trusted
me
but
after
a
time
i
wanted
to
eat
nuts
so
badly
that
i
could
not
think
of
anything
else
every
day
i
tried
to
think
of
some
way
of
eating
them
without
being
caught
i
tried
to
slip
some
into
my
sleeves
but
i
was
so
awkward
that
i
always
dropped
them
besides
i
wanted
to
eat
a
lot
of
them
a
great
big
lot
i
thought
i
should
like
to
eat
a
sackful
one
day
i
managed
to
steal
some
bonne
esther
who
was
taking
us
up
to
bed
slipped
on
a
nutshell
and
dropped
her
lantern
which
went
out
i
was
close
to
a
big
bowl
of
nuts
and
i
took
a
handful
and
put
them
in
my
pocket
as
soon
as
everybody
was
in
bed
i
took
the
nuts
out
of
my
pocket
put
my
head
under
the
sheets
and
crammed
them
into
my
mouth
but
it
seemed
to
me
at
once
as
though
everybody
in
the
dormitory
must
hear
the
noise
that
my
jaws
were
making
i
did
all
i
could
to
munch
slowly
and
quietly
but
the
noise
thumped
in
my
ears
like
the
blows
of
a
mallet
bonne
esther
got
up
lit
the
lamp
stooped
down
and
looked
under
the
beds
when
she
came
to
mine
i
looked
out
at
her
trembling
she
whispered
are
you
asleep
yet
and
went
on
looking
she
went
down
to
the
end
of
the
dormitory
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
again
but
she
was
hardly
back
in
bed
with
the
light
out
before
the
latch
of
the
door
made
a
little
sound
as
though
somebody
were
opening
it
bonne
esther
lit
her
lamp
again
and
said
whatever
is
it
it
can
not
be
the
cat
opening
the
door
by
itself
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
afraid
i
heard
her
moving
about
in
her
bed
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
called
out
oh
dear
oh
dear
ismérie
asked
her
what
the
matter
was
she
said
that
a
hand
had
opened
the
door
and
she
had
felt
a
breath
on
her
face
in
the
we
saw
the
door
half
open
i
was
very
frightened
i
thought
it
was
the
devil
who
had
come
to
fetch
me
we
waited
a
long
long
time
but
we
heard
nothing
more
bonne
esther
asked
if
one
of
us
would
get
up
and
put
the
light
out
although
it
was
not
very
far
from
her
own
bed
nobody
answered
then
she
called
me
i
got
up
and
she
said
you
are
such
a
good
little
girl
that
ghosts
wo
do
any
harm
to
you
she
put
her
head
under
the
bedclothes
and
i
blew
the
lamp
out
and
directly
it
was
put
out
i
saw
thousands
of
shining
specks
of
light
and
felt
something
cold
on
my
cheeks
i
was
sure
that
there
were
green
dragons
with
mouths
aflame
under
the
beds
i
could
feel
their
claws
on
my
feet
and
lights
were
jumping
about
on
each
side
of
my
head
i
wanted
to
sit
down
and
when
i
got
to
my
bed
i
was
quite
sure
that
my
two
feet
had
gone
when
i
dared
i
stooped
down
and
felt
for
them
they
were
very
cold
i
went
to
sleep
at
last
holding
them
in
my
two
hands
in
the
morning
bonne
esther
found
the
cat
on
a
bed
near
the
door
she
had
had
kittens
during
the
night
when
sister
was
told
about
it
she
said
that
the
cat
had
certainly
opened
the
door
by
jumping
at
the
latch
but
we
never
felt
sure
about
that
and
the
little
girls
used
to
talk
about
it
in
low
voices
for
a
long
time
next
week
all
the
girls
who
were
eight
years
old
went
down
to
the
big
dormitory
i
had
a
bed
near
the
window
quite
close
to
sister
room
marie
renaud
and
ismérie
again
had
their
beds
on
each
side
of
me
when
we
were
in
bed
sister
often
used
to
come
and
sit
by
me
she
would
take
one
of
my
hands
and
pat
it
and
look
out
of
the
window
one
night
there
was
a
big
fire
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
whole
dormitory
was
lit
up
sister
opened
the
window
wide
shook
me
and
said
wake
up
come
and
see
the
fire
she
took
me
in
her
arms
passed
her
hands
over
my
face
to
wake
me
and
said
again
come
and
see
the
fire
see
how
beautiful
it
is
i
was
so
sleepy
that
my
head
fell
on
her
shoulder
then
she
boxed
my
ears
and
called
me
a
little
silly
and
i
woke
up
and
began
to
cry
she
took
me
in
her
arms
again
sat
down
and
rocked
me
holding
me
close
to
her
she
bent
her
head
forward
towards
the
window
her
face
looked
transparent
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
light
ismérie
hated
sister
to
come
to
the
window
it
prevented
her
from
talking
and
she
always
had
something
to
say
her
voice
was
so
loud
that
one
heard
it
at
the
other
end
of
the
dormitory
sister
used
to
say
there
ismérie
talking
again
and
ismérie
used
to
answer
there
sister
scolding
again
her
daring
frightened
me
but
sister
used
to
pretend
not
to
hear
her
but
one
day
she
said
i
forbid
you
to
answer
me
little
dwarf
ismérie
answered
this
was
a
word
which
we
had
made
up
ourselves
it
meant
look
at
my
nose
and
see
if
i
care
sister
reached
for
a
cane
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
she
was
going
to
whip
ismérie
but
ismérie
threw
herself
down
flat
on
her
stomach
and
wriggled
about
and
made
funny
noises
sister
pushed
her
away
with
her
foot
threw
the
cane
away
and
said
oh
you
horrible
little
thing
afterwards
i
noticed
that
she
used
to
avoid
looking
at
her
and
never
seemed
to
hear
the
rude
things
she
said
but
she
forbade
us
to
carry
her
about
on
our
backs
that
never
prevented
ismérie
from
climbing
on
to
mine
like
a
monkey
i
had
the
courage
to
push
her
away
and
i
used
to
stoop
down
a
little
to
let
her
get
well
up
she
always
wanted
to
ride
when
we
went
up
to
the
dormitory
it
was
very
hard
for
her
to
get
up
the
stairs
she
used
to
laugh
about
it
herself
saying
that
she
hopped
up
like
an
old
hen
going
to
roost
as
sister
always
went
upstairs
first
i
used
to
wait
and
go
up
among
the
last
girls
but
sometimes
sister
would
turn
round
suddenly
then
ismérie
slipped
down
my
body
to
the
ground
with
wonderful
quickness
and
skill
i
always
felt
a
little
bit
awkward
when
i
caught
sister
eye
and
ismérie
always
said
see
what
a
fool
you
are
you
were
caught
again
marie
renaud
would
never
let
her
climb
up
on
to
her
back
she
used
to
say
that
she
wore
her
dress
out
and
made
it
dirty
esmérie
was
a
little
chatterbox
but
marie
renaud
hardly
ever
talked
at
all
every
morning
she
used
to
help
me
to
make
my
bed
she
would
pass
her
hands
over
the
sheets
to
smooth
them
out
and
always
refused
my
help
in
making
her
bed
because
she
said
i
rolled
the
sheets
all
kinds
of
ways
i
never
could
understand
why
her
bed
was
so
smooth
when
she
got
up
one
day
she
told
me
that
she
pinned
her
sheets
and
her
blankets
to
the
mattress
she
had
all
kinds
of
little
full
of
all
kinds
of
things
at
table
she
always
used
to
eat
some
of
yesterday
dessert
the
dessert
of
the
day
went
into
her
pocket
she
used
to
finger
it
there
and
would
munch
a
little
bit
of
it
from
time
to
time
i
often
found
her
sitting
in
corners
making
lace
with
a
pin
her
great
pleasure
was
brushing
folding
and
putting
things
in
order
that
was
why
my
shoes
were
always
well
brushed
and
my
sunday
dress
carefully
folded
but
one
day
a
new
servant
came
whose
name
was
madeleine
she
soon
found
out
that
i
did
not
take
care
of
my
own
things
she
got
excited
and
said
i
was
a
great
big
lazy
girl
and
that
i
made
other
people
wait
on
me
as
though
i
were
a
countess
she
said
it
was
a
shame
to
make
poor
little
marie
renaud
work
bonne
néron
agreed
with
her
and
said
i
was
puffed
up
with
pride
that
i
thought
i
was
better
than
anybody
else
that
i
never
did
anything
like
other
girls
they
both
said
together
that
they
had
never
seen
a
girl
like
me
and
both
of
them
leaned
over
me
and
shouted
at
me
together
they
made
me
think
of
two
noisy
fairies
a
black
one
and
a
white
one
madeleine
was
fresh
and
fair
with
full
open
lips
and
teeth
which
were
wide
apart
her
tongue
was
broad
and
thick
and
moved
about
into
the
corners
of
her
mouth
when
she
talked
bonne
néron
raised
her
hand
to
me
and
said
drop
your
eyes
this
minute
as
they
went
away
i
heard
her
say
to
madeleine
she
makes
you
ashamed
of
yourself
when
she
looks
at
you
like
that
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
bonne
néron
looked
like
a
bull
but
i
could
not
find
out
what
animal
madeleine
was
like
i
thought
it
over
for
several
days
thinking
of
all
the
animals
i
knew
and
at
last
i
gave
it
up
she
was
fat
and
her
hips
swayed
when
she
walked
she
had
a
piercing
voice
which
surprised
everybody
she
asked
leave
to
sing
in
church
but
as
she
did
not
know
the
hymns
sister
told
me
to
teach
her
after
that
marie
renaud
was
allowed
to
brush
and
smooth
out
my
things
without
anybody
taking
any
notice
of
it
she
was
so
pleased
that
she
gave
me
a
as
a
present
so
as
to
fasten
up
my
handkerchief
which
i
was
always
losing
two
days
later
i
lost
both
the
and
the
handkerchief
oh
that
handkerchief
it
was
a
perfect
nightmare
i
used
to
lose
one
regularly
every
week
sister
gave
us
a
clean
in
return
for
the
dirty
one
which
we
had
to
throw
down
on
to
the
ground
in
front
of
her
i
never
thought
of
mine
till
the
last
moment
and
then
i
turned
out
all
my
pockets
i
ran
about
like
a
mad
thing
into
the
dormitory
up
and
down
the
passages
and
up
to
the
garret
hunting
for
it
everywhere
oh
dear
oh
dear
if
i
could
only
find
a
handkerchief
somewhere
as
i
passed
in
front
of
the
picture
of
the
virgin
i
would
put
my
hands
together
and
pray
fervently
admirable
mother
make
me
find
a
handkerchief
but
i
never
did
find
one
and
i
went
downstairs
again
red
in
the
face
out
of
breath
feeling
dreadfully
unhappy
and
not
daring
to
take
the
clean
handkerchief
which
sister
handed
to
me
before
she
spoke
i
could
hear
the
scolding
which
i
knew
i
deserved
and
even
when
sister
said
nothing
at
all
i
could
see
her
frown
and
her
eyes
looked
crossly
at
me
and
followed
me
about
i
felt
crushed
with
shame
so
crushed
that
i
could
scarcely
lift
my
feet
i
tried
to
hide
in
the
corners
as
i
walked
and
in
spite
of
it
all
next
time
i
had
lost
my
handkerchief
again
madeleine
used
to
look
at
me
with
sham
compassion
but
she
could
not
always
prevent
herself
from
telling
me
that
i
deserved
to
be
punished
severely
she
seemed
very
fond
of
sister
she
waited
on
her
always
and
she
would
burst
into
tears
at
her
slightest
word
then
sister
had
to
soothe
her
by
patting
her
cheeks
and
she
would
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
and
move
her
shoulders
about
showing
her
white
neck
bonne
néron
used
to
say
that
she
looked
like
a
cat
bonne
néron
left
one
day
after
a
scene
in
the
middle
of
luncheon
it
happened
during
a
dead
silence
all
of
a
sudden
she
shouted
out
yes
i
want
to
go
and
i
am
going
sister
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
and
bonne
néron
faced
her
putting
her
head
down
shaking
it
butting
at
her
almost
and
shouting
all
the
time
that
she
would
not
be
ordered
about
by
a
bit
of
a
baby
she
walked
backwards
as
she
shouted
got
to
the
door
and
pulled
it
open
before
she
went
out
of
the
room
she
threw
one
of
her
long
arms
out
at
sister
and
shrieked
she
is
even
some
of
the
little
girls
were
frightened
others
burst
out
laughing
madeleine
got
quite
hysterical
she
threw
herself
on
to
the
floor
at
sister
knees
kissing
her
dress
and
winding
her
arms
round
her
legs
she
got
hold
of
her
two
hands
and
mumbled
over
them
with
her
big
moist
mouth
screaming
all
the
time
as
though
some
terrible
catastrophe
had
happened
sister
could
not
shake
her
off
at
last
she
got
angry
then
madeleine
fainted
and
fell
on
her
back
as
she
was
undoing
her
sister
made
a
sign
towards
the
part
of
the
room
where
i
was
i
thought
she
wanted
me
and
ran
to
her
but
she
sent
me
back
again
no
not
you
marie
renaud
she
said
she
gave
her
keys
to
marie
and
although
she
had
never
been
in
sister
room
she
found
the
bottle
of
salts
which
sister
wanted
without
any
loss
of
time
madeleine
soon
got
better
and
took
bonne
néron
place
she
got
more
authority
over
us
she
was
still
timid
and
submissive
to
sister
but
she
made
up
for
that
by
shouting
at
us
for
any
reason
and
no
reason
that
she
was
there
to
look
after
us
and
was
not
our
servant
the
day
she
fainted
i
had
seen
her
neck
i
had
never
dreamt
of
anything
so
beautiful
but
she
was
a
stupid
girl
and
i
never
minded
what
she
said
to
me
that
used
to
make
her
very
angry
she
used
to
say
all
kinds
of
rude
things
to
me
and
always
finished
up
by
calling
me
miss
princess
she
could
not
forgive
me
for
sister
affection
for
me
and
whenever
she
saw
the
sister
kissing
me
she
got
quite
red
with
anger
i
began
to
grow
and
my
health
was
pretty
good
sister
said
that
she
was
proud
of
me
she
used
to
squeeze
me
so
tight
when
she
kissed
me
that
she
sometimes
hurt
me
then
she
would
say
putting
her
fingers
on
my
forehead
my
little
girl
my
little
child
during
recreation
i
often
used
to
sit
near
her
and
listen
to
her
reading
she
read
in
a
deep
voice
and
when
the
people
in
the
book
displeased
her
more
than
usual
she
used
to
shut
it
up
angrily
and
come
and
play
games
with
us
she
wanted
me
to
be
quite
faultless
she
would
say
i
want
you
to
be
perfect
do
you
hear
child
perfect
one
day
she
thought
i
had
told
a
lie
there
were
three
cows
which
used
to
graze
on
some
land
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
great
big
chestnut
tree
the
white
cow
was
wicked
and
we
were
afraid
of
it
because
it
had
knocked
a
little
girl
down
once
that
day
i
saw
the
two
red
cows
and
just
under
the
chestnut
tree
i
saw
a
big
black
cow
i
said
to
ismérie
look
the
white
cow
has
been
sent
away
because
she
was
wicked
i
expect
ismérie
who
was
cross
that
day
screamed
and
said
that
i
was
always
laughing
at
the
others
and
trying
to
make
them
believe
things
which
were
not
true
i
showed
her
the
cow
she
said
it
was
a
white
one
i
said
no
it
is
a
black
one
sister
heard
us
she
was
very
angry
and
said
how
dare
you
say
that
the
cow
is
black
then
the
cow
moved
she
looked
black
and
white
now
and
i
understood
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
because
of
the
shadow
of
the
chestnut
tree
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
could
not
find
anything
to
say
i
did
not
know
how
to
explain
it
sister
shook
me
why
did
you
tell
a
lie
she
said
i
answered
that
i
did
not
know
she
sent
me
into
a
corner
in
the
shed
and
told
me
that
i
should
have
nothing
but
bread
and
water
that
day
as
i
had
not
told
a
lie
the
punishment
did
not
worry
me
the
shed
had
a
lot
of
old
cupboards
in
it
and
some
garden
tools
i
climbed
from
one
thing
on
to
the
other
and
got
right
up
and
sat
on
the
top
of
the
highest
cupboard
i
was
ten
years
old
and
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
been
alone
i
felt
pleased
at
this
i
sat
there
swinging
my
legs
and
began
to
imagine
a
whole
invisible
world
the
old
cupboard
with
rusty
locks
became
the
entrance
gate
to
a
magnificent
palace
i
was
a
little
girl
who
had
been
left
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
a
beautiful
lady
dressed
like
a
fairy
had
seen
me
up
there
and
came
to
fetch
me
three
or
four
lovely
ducks
ran
in
front
of
her
they
had
just
come
up
to
me
when
i
saw
sister
standing
in
front
of
the
cupboard
with
the
rusty
locks
and
looking
about
for
me
everywhere
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
sitting
on
the
cupboard
i
still
believed
myself
to
be
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
i
felt
cross
because
sister
arrival
had
made
the
palace
and
the
lovely
lady
disappear
she
saw
my
legs
swinging
and
just
as
she
saw
me
i
remembered
that
i
was
sitting
on
the
cupboard
she
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
me
then
she
took
a
piece
of
bread
a
piece
of
sausage
and
a
little
bottle
of
wine
out
of
the
pocket
of
her
dress
showed
me
one
thing
after
the
other
and
in
an
angry
voice
said
this
for
you
there
and
she
put
it
all
back
into
her
pocket
and
went
away
a
moment
afterwards
madeleine
brought
me
some
bread
and
water
and
i
remained
in
the
shed
till
evening
sister
had
been
growing
sadder
and
sadder
for
some
time
she
never
played
with
us
any
more
and
she
even
used
to
forget
our
dinner
time
madeleine
would
send
me
to
the
chapel
to
fetch
her
and
i
would
find
her
there
on
her
knees
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
i
had
to
pull
at
her
dress
before
she
took
any
notice
of
me
often
i
thought
that
she
had
been
crying
but
i
never
dared
to
look
at
her
closely
for
fear
she
would
get
angry
she
seemed
lost
in
thought
and
when
we
spoke
to
her
she
answered
yes
or
no
quite
sharply
but
she
took
a
great
interest
in
the
little
feast
which
we
had
at
easter
every
year
she
had
the
cakes
brought
in
and
we
put
them
on
a
table
and
covered
them
with
a
white
cloth
so
that
the
greedy
girls
should
not
see
them
all
at
the
same
time
on
feast
days
we
were
allowed
to
talk
as
much
as
we
liked
at
table
and
we
made
a
tremendous
noise
sister
waited
on
us
with
a
smile
and
a
word
for
each
of
us
that
day
she
was
going
to
serve
the
cakes
and
madeleine
who
was
helping
her
was
taking
off
the
cloth
which
covered
them
then
a
cat
which
had
been
under
the
cloth
jumped
down
and
ran
away
sister
and
madeleine
both
said
oh
and
madeleine
said
the
dirty
beast
has
been
nibbling
all
the
cakes
sister
did
not
like
the
cat
she
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
minute
then
ran
to
the
corner
took
a
stick
and
ran
after
it
it
was
horrible
the
cat
was
frightened
out
of
its
wits
and
jumped
this
way
and
that
out
of
the
way
of
the
stick
with
which
sister
kept
hitting
the
benches
and
the
walls
all
the
little
girls
were
frightened
and
ran
towards
the
door
sister
stopped
them
nobody
is
to
go
out
she
said
i
hardly
knew
her
her
lips
were
pressed
together
her
cheeks
were
as
white
as
her
cap
and
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
flame
frightened
me
so
that
i
hid
my
face
in
the
hollow
of
my
arm
i
did
not
want
to
do
so
but
i
soon
looked
up
again
the
cat
hunt
was
still
going
on
sister
with
her
stick
in
the
air
ran
after
the
cat
without
saying
a
word
her
lips
were
open
and
i
could
see
her
little
pointed
teeth
she
ran
about
jumping
over
the
benches
and
climbed
up
on
to
the
table
lifting
her
petticoats
as
she
did
so
when
she
was
going
to
hit
the
cat
it
jumped
and
ran
up
a
curtain
right
on
to
the
top
of
the
window
madeleine
who
had
been
following
sister
about
wanted
to
go
and
fetch
a
longer
stick
but
sister
stopped
her
and
said
it
is
lucky
to
have
got
away
bonne
justine
who
was
standing
near
me
hid
her
eyes
and
murmured
oh
it
is
shameful
shameful
and
i
thought
it
was
shameful
too
i
felt
as
though
sister
had
grown
smaller
i
had
always
thought
her
quite
faultless
i
compared
this
scene
with
another
one
which
had
happened
one
day
when
there
was
a
big
storm
that
day
sister
had
been
wonderful
while
she
was
chasing
the
cat
i
could
see
her
that
other
day
as
she
stood
on
a
bench
and
closed
the
windows
quietly
lifting
her
lovely
arms
her
wide
sleeves
fell
down
on
her
shoulders
and
while
we
shivered
and
shook
in
terror
at
the
lightning
and
the
whistling
wind
she
said
quietly
it
is
quite
a
storm
sister
made
the
little
girls
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
opened
the
door
wide
and
the
cat
rushed
out
one
afternoon
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
not
our
old
priest
who
was
saying
vespers
this
one
was
a
tall
fine
man
he
sang
with
a
strong
jerky
voice
we
talked
about
him
all
the
evening
madeleine
said
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
sister
thought
she
said
that
he
had
a
young
voice
but
that
he
pronounced
his
words
like
an
old
man
and
that
he
was
distinguished
looking
when
he
came
to
pay
us
a
visit
two
or
three
days
afterwards
i
saw
that
he
had
white
hair
in
little
curls
round
his
neck
and
that
his
eyes
and
his
eyebrows
were
very
black
he
asked
for
those
of
us
who
were
preparing
their
catechism
and
wanted
to
know
everybody
name
sister
answered
for
me
she
put
her
hand
on
my
head
and
said
this
is
our
marie
claire
when
ismérie
came
up
in
her
turn
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
made
her
turn
round
and
walk
for
him
to
see
he
said
that
she
was
no
bigger
than
a
child
of
three
and
when
he
asked
sister
if
she
was
intelligent
ismérie
turned
round
sharply
and
said
that
she
was
not
as
stupid
as
the
rest
of
us
he
burst
out
laughing
and
i
saw
that
his
teeth
were
very
white
when
he
spoke
he
jerked
himself
forward
as
though
he
wanted
to
catch
his
words
again
they
seemed
to
drop
out
of
his
mouth
in
spite
of
himself
sister
took
him
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
she
never
used
to
take
any
visitors
further
than
the
door
of
the
room
she
came
back
climbed
up
to
her
desk
again
and
after
a
moment
she
said
without
looking
at
anybody
he
really
is
a
very
distinguished
man
our
new
priest
lived
in
a
little
house
near
the
chapel
in
the
evening
he
used
to
walk
in
the
avenue
of
linden
trees
he
often
passed
close
to
the
playground
where
we
were
playing
and
he
always
used
to
bow
very
low
to
sister
every
thursday
afternoon
he
came
to
see
us
he
sat
down
leaning
against
the
back
of
his
chair
and
crossing
his
legs
he
told
us
stories
he
was
very
pleasant
and
sister
used
to
say
that
he
laughed
as
though
he
enjoyed
it
sometimes
sister
was
then
he
used
to
go
up
and
see
her
in
her
room
we
would
see
madeleine
passing
with
a
teapot
and
two
cups
she
was
red
in
the
face
and
very
busy
when
the
summer
was
over
le
curé
came
to
see
us
after
dinner
and
spent
the
evenings
with
us
when
nine
struck
he
used
to
go
and
sister
always
went
with
him
down
the
passage
to
the
big
front
door
he
had
been
with
us
for
a
year
and
i
could
never
get
used
to
making
confession
to
him
he
often
used
to
look
at
me
and
laugh
in
a
way
that
made
me
think
that
he
remembered
my
faults
we
went
to
confession
on
fixed
days
each
one
of
us
took
her
turn
when
there
were
only
one
or
two
to
go
in
before
me
i
began
to
tremble
my
heart
beat
dreadfully
fast
and
i
got
cramp
in
my
stomach
which
prevented
me
from
breathing
properly
when
my
turn
came
i
got
up
and
felt
my
legs
trembling
under
me
my
head
buzzed
and
my
cheeks
turned
cold
i
fell
on
my
knees
in
the
confessional
and
le
curé
voice
which
sounded
as
though
it
came
from
a
long
way
off
gave
me
confidence
but
he
always
had
to
help
me
to
remember
my
faults
if
he
had
i
should
have
forgotten
half
of
them
at
the
end
of
confession
he
always
asked
me
what
my
name
was
i
longed
to
tell
him
another
name
but
while
i
was
wondering
if
i
dare
my
own
name
used
to
slip
out
of
my
mouth
it
was
getting
near
the
time
for
our
communion
it
was
to
be
in
may
and
preparations
for
it
were
beginning
sister
composed
some
new
hymns
she
had
made
one
which
was
a
sort
of
thanksgiving
for
le
curé
a
fortnight
before
the
ceremony
they
separated
us
from
the
others
we
had
prayed
all
day
long
madeleine
was
supposed
to
see
that
we
were
not
disturbed
at
prayer
but
she
often
used
to
disturb
us
herself
by
quarrelling
with
one
of
us
my
fellow
communicant
was
called
sophie
she
was
a
quiet
little
girl
and
we
always
kept
out
of
the
quarrels
we
used
to
talk
over
serious
matters
i
often
told
her
how
much
i
hated
confession
and
how
frightened
i
was
that
i
should
pass
through
my
communion
badly
she
was
very
good
and
she
did
not
understand
what
i
had
to
be
afraid
of
she
thought
that
i
was
not
pious
enough
and
she
had
noticed
that
i
used
to
go
to
sleep
during
prayers
she
confessed
to
me
that
she
was
very
frightened
of
death
she
used
to
talk
about
it
in
a
low
voice
and
looked
very
frightened
her
eyes
were
green
and
her
hair
was
so
lovely
that
sister
would
never
have
it
cut
short
like
that
of
the
other
girls
at
last
the
great
day
came
my
general
confession
had
passed
off
all
right
it
gave
me
the
same
feeling
that
a
bath
does
i
felt
very
clean
after
it
but
i
trembled
so
when
i
was
given
the
holy
wafer
that
a
bit
of
it
stuck
in
my
teeth
a
sort
of
dizziness
came
over
me
and
i
felt
as
though
a
big
black
curtain
had
dropped
in
front
of
my
eyes
i
thought
i
heard
sister
voice
asking
are
you
ill
and
i
seemed
to
know
that
she
went
with
me
as
far
as
my
and
that
she
put
my
taper
into
my
hand
and
said
hold
it
tight
my
throat
had
grown
so
tight
that
i
could
not
swallow
and
i
felt
a
liquid
dropping
from
my
mouth
into
my
throat
then
i
was
wildly
frightened
for
madeleine
had
warned
us
that
if
we
bit
the
holy
wafer
the
blood
of
christ
would
stream
from
our
mouths
and
that
nobody
would
be
able
to
stop
it
sister
wiped
my
face
and
whispered
quite
low
take
care
dear
are
you
ill
my
throat
loosened
and
i
swallowed
the
wafer
then
at
last
i
dared
to
look
down
to
see
the
blood
on
my
dress
but
i
saw
only
a
little
grey
spot
like
a
drop
of
water
i
put
my
handkerchief
to
my
lips
and
wiped
my
face
there
was
no
blood
on
it
i
did
not
feel
quite
sure
yet
but
when
we
got
up
to
sing
i
tried
to
sing
with
the
others
when
le
curé
came
to
see
us
later
in
the
day
sister
told
him
that
i
had
almost
fainted
at
communion
he
took
my
chin
in
his
hand
and
tipped
my
face
up
towards
him
then
after
looking
into
my
eyes
he
began
to
laugh
and
said
that
i
was
a
very
sensitive
little
girl
after
our
first
communion
we
did
not
attend
class
any
more
bonne
justine
taught
us
to
sew
we
made
caps
for
peasant
women
it
was
not
very
difficult
and
as
it
was
something
new
i
worked
hard
bonne
justine
said
that
i
should
make
a
very
good
sister
used
to
kiss
me
and
say
so
you
would
if
you
could
only
get
over
your
laziness
but
when
i
had
made
a
few
caps
and
had
to
go
on
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
my
laziness
got
the
better
of
me
the
work
bored
me
and
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
i
could
have
remained
for
hours
and
hours
without
moving
watching
the
others
work
marie
renaud
never
spoke
to
us
while
she
was
sewing
her
stitches
were
so
small
and
so
close
together
that
one
needed
good
eyes
to
see
them
ismérie
sang
all
the
time
she
sewed
and
nobody
ever
scolded
her
some
of
the
girls
sewed
with
bent
backs
and
a
frown
on
their
foreheads
their
fingers
were
moist
and
their
needles
squeaked
others
sewed
slowly
and
carefully
without
getting
tired
or
bored
counting
their
stitches
under
their
breath
that
is
the
way
i
should
have
liked
to
sew
i
used
to
scold
myself
for
not
doing
so
and
then
i
used
to
imitate
them
for
a
few
minutes
but
the
least
sound
disturbed
me
and
i
would
stop
and
listen
or
look
at
what
was
going
on
all
round
me
madeleine
said
that
my
nose
was
always
in
the
air
i
spent
most
of
my
time
imagining
needles
which
would
sew
all
by
themselves
for
a
long
time
i
hoped
that
an
old
woman
whom
nobody
would
see
but
i
would
come
out
of
the
big
fireplace
and
sew
my
cap
for
me
very
quickly
at
last
i
took
no
notice
of
sister
scolding
and
she
did
know
what
to
do
to
make
me
work
one
day
she
decided
that
i
was
to
read
aloud
twice
a
day
it
was
a
great
joy
for
me
the
time
to
begin
reading
never
seemed
to
come
quickly
enough
and
i
was
always
sorry
when
i
closed
the
book
when
i
had
finished
reading
sister
used
to
make
colette
the
cripple
sing
to
us
she
always
sang
the
same
songs
but
her
voice
was
so
lovely
that
we
never
got
tired
of
listening
to
it
she
sang
quite
simply
without
stopping
her
work
and
she
kept
time
with
her
needle
as
she
sang
bonne
justine
who
knew
all
about
everybody
told
us
that
colette
had
been
brought
in
with
both
legs
broken
when
she
was
quite
a
tiny
child
she
was
twenty
now
she
walked
with
great
difficulty
helping
herself
with
two
sticks
and
she
would
never
use
crutches
because
she
was
afraid
of
looking
like
an
old
woman
during
recreation
i
always
used
to
see
her
alone
on
a
bench
she
kept
on
throwing
herself
back
and
stretching
her
dark
eyes
had
such
big
pupils
that
one
hardly
saw
the
whites
at
all
i
felt
drawn
towards
her
i
should
have
liked
to
have
been
her
friend
she
seemed
very
proud
and
whenever
i
did
any
little
thing
for
her
she
had
a
way
of
saying
thank
you
little
one
which
made
me
remember
that
i
was
only
twelve
years
old
madeleine
told
me
mysteriously
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
talk
to
colette
alone
and
when
i
wanted
to
know
why
she
reeled
out
a
long
complicated
story
which
told
me
nothing
at
all
i
asked
bonne
justine
who
used
a
lot
of
words
which
i
did
understand
but
told
me
that
a
little
girl
like
me
must
not
be
alone
with
colette
i
could
never
understand
why
i
noticed
that
every
time
one
of
the
big
girls
gave
her
her
arm
to
help
her
to
walk
about
a
little
three
or
four
other
girls
always
came
up
and
talked
and
laughed
with
them
i
thought
that
she
had
no
friends
a
feeling
of
great
pity
drew
me
to
her
and
one
day
when
she
was
all
alone
i
asked
her
to
take
my
arm
for
a
little
walk
i
was
standing
in
front
of
her
timidly
but
i
knew
that
she
would
not
refuse
she
looked
at
me
and
said
you
know
it
is
not
allowed
i
nodded
yes
she
looked
at
me
again
are
you
afraid
of
being
punished
she
said
i
shook
my
head
to
say
no
i
wanted
to
cry
and
it
made
my
throat
feel
tight
i
helped
her
to
get
up
she
leaned
on
her
stick
with
one
hand
and
put
all
her
weight
on
my
shoulder
i
could
see
how
difficult
it
was
for
her
to
walk
she
did
not
say
a
word
to
me
while
we
were
walking
and
when
i
had
taken
her
back
to
her
bench
she
looked
at
me
and
said
thank
you
marie
claire
when
she
saw
me
with
colette
bonne
justine
raised
her
arms
to
heaven
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
at
the
other
end
of
the
playground
madeleine
shook
her
fist
at
me
and
shouted
when
evening
came
i
saw
that
sister
knew
what
i
had
done
but
she
never
said
a
word
about
it
at
recreation
next
day
she
drew
me
towards
her
took
my
head
in
her
two
hands
and
bent
towards
me
she
did
say
anything
to
me
but
her
eyes
plunged
right
into
my
face
i
felt
as
though
i
were
wrapped
up
in
her
eyes
i
felt
as
though
a
soft
warmth
was
all
round
me
and
i
felt
comfortable
she
gave
me
a
long
kiss
on
the
forehead
then
smiled
at
me
and
said
there
you
are
my
beautiful
white
lily
i
thought
her
so
beautiful
and
her
eyes
shone
so
with
several
colours
in
them
that
i
said
to
her
and
you
too
mother
you
are
a
lovely
flower
she
said
in
an
way
yes
but
i
do
count
among
the
lilies
now
then
she
said
almost
roughly
do
you
love
ismérie
any
more
yes
mother
really
then
what
about
colette
i
love
colette
too
oh
you
love
everybody
she
said
i
used
to
give
colette
my
arm
nearly
every
day
she
never
talked
to
me
much
and
then
only
about
the
other
girls
when
i
sat
down
next
to
her
she
used
to
look
at
me
queerly
she
said
she
thought
i
was
a
queer
little
thing
one
day
she
asked
me
if
i
thought
her
pretty
directly
she
said
it
i
remembered
that
sister
said
that
she
was
as
black
as
a
mole
i
saw
however
that
she
had
a
broad
forehead
fine
big
eyes
and
the
rest
of
her
face
was
small
and
refined
whenever
i
looked
at
her
i
did
quite
know
why
but
i
thought
of
a
well
deep
and
dark
and
full
of
hot
water
no
i
did
think
her
pretty
but
i
would
tell
her
so
because
she
was
a
cripple
i
said
she
would
be
much
prettier
if
her
skin
were
whiter
little
by
little
i
became
her
friend
she
told
me
that
she
hoped
to
go
away
and
get
married
like
nina
had
done
nina
used
to
come
and
see
us
on
sundays
with
her
child
colette
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
said
you
see
i
must
get
married
i
must
then
she
stretched
herself
bending
her
whole
body
forward
sometimes
she
used
to
cry
and
was
in
such
deep
trouble
that
i
could
not
find
anything
to
say
to
her
she
would
look
at
her
poor
twisted
legs
and
groan
out
there
would
have
to
be
a
miracle
for
me
to
get
away
from
here
all
of
a
sudden
i
got
the
idea
that
the
virgin
could
bring
this
miracle
about
colette
thought
it
a
splendid
idea
she
was
quite
surprised
that
she
had
never
thought
of
it
it
was
only
fair
that
she
should
have
legs
like
the
others
she
wanted
to
see
about
it
at
once
she
explained
to
me
that
several
girls
would
be
necessary
for
the
nine
days
prayer
and
said
that
we
must
go
and
purify
ourselves
at
communion
and
that
during
nine
days
we
would
pray
all
the
time
so
as
to
get
help
from
our
lady
in
heaven
this
had
to
be
done
in
the
greatest
secrecy
it
was
arranged
that
sophie
should
be
one
of
us
because
she
was
so
very
good
and
colette
said
she
would
talk
to
some
of
the
big
girls
who
were
good
too
two
days
afterwards
it
was
all
arranged
colette
was
to
fast
during
the
nine
days
on
the
tenth
day
which
would
be
a
sunday
she
would
go
to
communion
as
usual
leaning
on
her
stick
and
the
arm
of
one
of
us
then
when
she
had
taken
the
holy
wafer
she
would
make
a
vow
to
bring
up
her
children
in
the
love
of
the
virgin
and
after
that
she
would
rise
up
straight
and
would
sing
the
te
deum
in
her
beautiful
voice
and
we
would
all
sing
it
with
her
for
nine
days
i
prayed
more
fervently
than
i
had
ever
prayed
before
the
ordinary
prayers
seemed
insipid
i
recited
the
virgin
litany
i
hunted
up
the
most
beautiful
hymns
of
praise
that
i
could
find
and
repeated
them
without
getting
tired
star
of
the
morning
make
colette
whole
the
first
time
i
remained
on
my
knees
for
so
long
that
sister
scolded
me
nobody
noticed
the
little
signs
which
we
made
to
one
another
and
the
nine
days
of
prayer
passed
off
without
any
one
knowing
anything
about
them
colette
was
very
pale
when
she
came
to
mass
her
cheeks
were
thinner
than
ever
and
she
stood
with
her
eyes
cast
down
her
eyelids
were
deep
violet
i
thought
to
myself
that
the
end
of
her
martyrdom
had
come
and
i
was
filled
with
a
deep
joy
quite
close
to
me
the
picture
of
the
virgin
in
a
flowing
white
robe
smiled
as
it
looked
at
me
and
in
an
outburst
of
all
my
faith
my
thoughts
cried
out
oh
mirror
of
justice
make
colette
whole
my
temples
were
stretched
tightly
i
was
straining
every
nerve
to
keep
my
thoughts
from
wandering
and
i
went
on
saying
oh
mirror
of
justice
make
colette
whole
colette
went
up
to
the
communion
table
her
stick
made
a
little
clickety
noise
on
the
flagstones
when
she
was
on
her
knees
the
girl
who
had
gone
up
to
the
table
with
her
came
back
to
us
with
the
stick
she
knew
that
it
would
be
of
no
further
use
colette
tried
to
get
up
and
fell
back
again
on
to
her
knees
her
hand
reached
out
to
take
her
stick
and
when
she
did
find
it
by
her
side
she
tried
again
to
raise
herself
without
it
she
clung
to
the
holy
table
and
caught
hold
of
the
arm
of
one
of
the
sisters
who
was
taking
communion
with
her
then
her
shoulders
rocked
and
she
fell
over
pulling
the
sister
down
with
her
two
of
us
rushed
forward
and
dragged
poor
colette
to
her
bench
but
i
was
still
hoping
against
hope
and
until
mass
was
over
i
was
hoping
to
hear
the
te
deum
as
soon
as
i
could
i
went
back
to
colette
the
big
girls
were
round
her
trying
to
console
her
and
advising
her
to
give
herself
to
god
for
ever
she
was
crying
gently
not
sobbing
her
head
was
bent
a
little
forward
and
her
tears
fell
on
her
hands
which
were
crossed
one
over
the
other
i
kneeled
down
in
front
of
her
and
when
she
looked
at
me
i
said
perhaps
you
can
get
married
even
though
you
are
a
cripple
story
was
soon
known
to
everybody
everybody
felt
so
sad
about
it
that
we
stopped
playing
noisy
games
ismérie
thought
she
was
telling
me
a
tremendous
piece
of
news
when
she
told
me
all
about
it
sophie
told
me
that
we
must
submit
to
the
will
of
our
lady
because
she
knew
what
was
necessary
for
colette
happiness
better
than
we
did
i
should
have
liked
to
have
known
whether
sister
knew
about
colette
i
did
not
see
her
till
the
afternoon
when
we
were
out
walking
she
did
not
look
sad
she
looked
almost
pleased
i
had
never
seen
her
look
so
pretty
her
whole
face
shone
while
we
were
out
i
noticed
that
she
walked
as
though
something
was
lifting
her
up
i
never
remembered
to
have
seen
her
walk
like
that
her
veil
fluttered
a
little
at
the
shoulders
and
her
stomacher
did
hide
all
her
neck
she
paid
no
attention
to
us
she
was
looking
at
nothing
but
she
seemed
to
be
seeing
something
every
now
and
then
she
smiled
as
though
somebody
were
talking
to
her
from
inside
in
the
evening
after
dinner
i
found
her
sitting
on
the
old
bench
under
the
big
linden
tree
le
curé
was
sitting
next
to
her
with
his
back
against
the
tree
they
looked
serious
i
thought
they
were
talking
about
colette
and
i
remained
standing
some
distance
from
them
sister
was
saying
as
though
she
were
answering
a
question
yes
when
i
was
fifteen
le
curé
said
you
had
no
vocation
at
fifteen
i
did
hear
what
sister
answered
but
le
curé
went
on
or
rather
at
fifteen
you
had
every
possible
vocation
a
kind
word
or
a
little
indifference
would
be
enough
to
change
your
whole
life
he
said
nothing
for
a
moment
and
then
in
a
lower
tone
he
said
your
parents
were
very
much
to
blame
sister
answered
i
regret
nothing
they
remained
for
a
long
time
without
saying
a
word
then
sister
raised
one
finger
as
though
she
were
impressing
something
on
him
and
said
everywhere
in
spite
of
all
and
always
le
curé
stretched
his
hand
out
a
little
way
laughed
and
repeated
everywhere
in
spite
of
all
and
always
the
goodnight
bell
sounded
all
of
a
sudden
and
le
curé
went
off
down
the
avenue
of
linden
trees
for
a
long
time
afterwards
i
used
to
repeat
the
words
i
had
heard
them
say
but
i
could
never
fit
them
in
to
poor
colette
story
colette
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
a
miracle
to
take
her
away
and
yet
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
remain
when
she
saw
all
the
girls
of
her
own
age
go
one
by
one
she
began
to
rebel
she
would
not
go
to
confession
anymore
and
she
would
not
take
holy
communion
she
used
to
go
to
mass
because
she
sang
there
and
she
was
fond
of
music
i
often
stopped
with
her
and
consoled
her
she
explained
to
me
that
marriage
meant
love
sister
who
had
not
been
well
for
some
time
became
quite
madeleine
nursed
her
devotedly
and
treated
us
dreadfully
badly
she
was
particularly
unkind
to
me
and
when
she
saw
me
tired
of
sewing
she
would
say
trying
to
turn
her
nose
up
if
mademoiselle
objects
to
sewing
she
had
better
take
a
broom
and
sweep
one
sunday
she
hit
upon
the
idea
of
making
me
clean
the
stairs
during
mass
it
was
january
a
damp
cold
which
came
up
from
the
passages
climbed
the
steps
and
got
under
my
dress
i
swept
as
hard
as
i
could
to
keep
warm
the
sound
of
the
harmonium
came
from
the
chapel
out
to
me
from
time
to
time
i
recognized
madeleine
thin
piercing
tones
and
le
jerky
notes
i
could
follow
mass
by
the
singing
all
of
a
sudden
colette
voice
rose
above
all
the
others
it
was
strong
and
pure
it
broadened
drowned
the
sound
of
the
harmonium
drowned
everything
else
and
then
seemed
to
fly
away
over
the
linden
trees
over
the
house
and
over
the
church
spire
itself
it
made
me
tremble
and
when
the
voice
came
down
to
earth
trembling
a
little
as
it
went
back
into
the
church
and
was
swept
up
by
the
sound
of
the
harmonium
again
i
began
to
cry
sobbing
as
though
i
were
quite
a
little
girl
then
madeleine
sharp
voice
pierced
through
the
others
once
more
and
i
swept
and
swept
hard
as
though
my
broom
could
scratch
out
the
voice
which
was
so
disagreeable
to
me
that
was
the
day
sister
called
me
to
her
she
had
been
up
in
her
room
for
two
months
she
was
a
little
better
but
i
noticed
that
her
eyes
did
not
shine
at
all
they
made
me
think
of
a
rainbow
which
had
almost
melted
away
she
made
me
tell
her
funny
little
stories
about
what
had
been
going
on
and
she
tried
to
smile
while
she
was
listening
to
me
but
her
lips
only
smiled
on
one
side
of
her
mouth
she
asked
me
if
i
had
heard
her
screaming
oh
yes
i
said
i
had
heard
her
during
her
illness
she
had
screamed
so
dreadfully
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
the
whole
dormitory
had
been
kept
awake
madeleine
was
coming
and
going
we
heard
her
splashing
water
about
and
when
i
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
with
sister
she
said
as
she
hurried
past
that
she
had
rheumatism
i
remembered
at
once
that
bonne
justine
used
to
have
rheumatism
too
but
she
had
never
screamed
like
that
and
i
remember
wondering
whether
poor
sister
legs
were
swollen
to
three
times
their
size
like
those
of
bonne
justine
her
cries
got
worse
and
worse
one
of
them
was
so
terrible
that
it
seemed
to
come
right
out
of
her
vitals
then
we
had
heard
her
moaning
and
that
was
all
a
few
moments
afterwards
madeleine
had
come
up
and
whispered
to
marie
renaud
marie
renaud
had
put
on
her
dress
and
i
heard
her
go
downstairs
directly
afterwards
she
came
back
with
le
curé
he
rushed
into
sister
room
and
madeleine
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
did
not
remain
very
long
but
he
went
away
again
much
more
slowly
than
he
had
come
he
walked
with
his
head
sunk
down
between
his
shoulders
and
his
right
hand
was
holding
his
cloak
over
his
left
arm
as
though
he
were
carrying
something
valuable
i
thought
to
myself
that
he
was
taking
away
the
holy
oils
and
i
did
not
dare
ask
whether
sister
were
dead
i
have
never
forgotten
the
blow
i
got
from
madeleine
fist
when
i
clung
to
her
dress
she
knocked
me
right
over
and
whispered
as
she
ran
past
she
is
better
as
soon
as
sister
was
well
again
madeleine
was
kinder
and
everything
went
on
as
before
i
disliked
sewing
as
much
as
ever
and
my
hatred
for
it
began
to
make
sister
uneasy
she
mentioned
it
in
front
of
me
to
le
curé
sister
le
curé
sister
was
an
old
maid
with
a
long
face
and
big
faded
eyes
we
called
her
mademoiselle
maximilienne
sister
told
her
how
anxious
she
was
about
my
future
she
said
that
i
learned
things
easily
but
that
no
kind
of
sewing
interested
me
she
had
noticed
for
some
time
that
i
was
fond
of
study
and
she
had
made
inquiries
to
find
out
whether
i
had
no
distant
relatives
who
would
look
after
me
she
said
but
the
only
relation
i
had
was
an
old
woman
who
had
adopted
my
sister
but
refused
to
take
me
mademoiselle
maximilienne
offered
to
take
me
into
her
dressmaking
business
le
curé
thought
that
was
a
very
good
idea
and
said
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
go
and
teach
me
a
little
twice
a
week
sister
seemed
really
happy
at
this
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
thank
them
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
go
to
mademoiselle
maximilienne
as
soon
as
le
curé
returned
from
a
journey
to
rome
which
he
had
to
make
sister
would
get
my
outfit
ready
for
me
and
mademoiselle
maximilienne
would
go
to
the
mother
superior
and
ask
her
permission
she
said
i
felt
dreadfully
uncomfortable
at
the
idea
that
the
mother
superior
was
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
could
not
forget
the
unkind
look
she
always
gave
me
when
she
passed
the
old
bench
and
saw
me
sitting
there
with
sister
and
le
curé
so
i
waited
impatiently
to
hear
what
she
would
say
to
mademoiselle
maximilienne
le
curé
had
been
away
for
a
week
and
sister
used
to
talk
to
me
every
day
about
my
new
work
she
told
me
how
glad
she
would
be
to
see
me
on
sundays
she
gave
me
all
kinds
of
good
advice
told
me
to
be
good
and
to
take
care
of
my
health
the
mother
superior
sent
for
me
one
morning
when
i
went
into
her
room
i
noticed
that
she
was
sitting
in
a
big
red
armchair
i
began
to
remember
some
ghost
stories
which
i
had
heard
the
girls
tell
about
her
and
when
i
saw
her
sitting
there
all
black
in
the
middle
of
all
that
red
i
compared
her
in
my
mind
to
a
huge
poppy
which
had
grown
in
a
cellar
she
opened
and
closed
her
eyelids
several
times
she
had
a
smile
on
her
face
which
was
like
an
insult
i
felt
myself
blushing
but
i
did
not
turn
my
eyes
away
she
gave
a
little
sneering
chuckle
and
said
you
know
why
i
sent
for
you
i
answered
that
i
thought
it
was
to
talk
to
me
about
mademoiselle
maximilienne
she
sneered
again
oh
yes
mademoiselle
maximilienne
she
said
well
my
child
you
must
undeceive
yourself
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
place
you
on
a
farm
in
sologne
she
half
closed
her
eyes
and
snapped
out
you
are
to
be
a
shepherdess
young
woman
then
she
added
rapping
the
words
out
you
will
look
after
the
sheep
i
said
simply
very
well
mother
she
pulled
herself
up
out
of
the
depths
of
her
armchair
and
asked
me
do
you
know
what
looking
after
the
sheep
means
i
answered
that
i
had
seen
shepherdesses
in
the
fields
she
bent
her
yellow
face
towards
me
and
went
on
you
will
have
to
clean
the
stables
they
smell
very
unpleasantly
and
the
shepherdesses
are
dirty
you
will
help
in
the
work
of
the
farm
and
be
taught
to
milk
the
cows
and
look
after
the
pigs
she
spoke
very
loud
as
though
she
were
afraid
i
should
not
understand
her
i
answered
as
i
had
answered
before
very
well
mother
she
pulled
herself
up
by
the
arms
of
her
chair
fastened
her
shining
eyes
on
me
and
said
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
are
not
proud
i
smiled
and
said
no
mother
she
seemed
very
much
surprised
but
as
i
went
on
smiling
her
voice
grew
softer
really
my
child
she
said
i
always
thought
you
were
proud
she
dropped
back
into
her
chair
again
hid
her
eyes
under
their
lids
and
began
talking
quickly
in
a
monotonous
voice
as
she
did
when
she
said
prayers
she
said
that
i
must
obey
my
masters
that
i
must
never
forget
my
religious
duties
and
that
the
farmer
wife
would
come
and
fetch
me
the
day
before
the
feast
of
john
i
went
out
of
her
room
with
feelings
which
i
could
not
express
but
i
felt
horribly
afraid
of
hurting
sister
feelings
how
could
i
tell
her
i
had
no
time
to
think
sister
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
passage
she
took
hold
of
my
two
shoulders
bent
her
face
towards
me
and
said
well
she
looked
anxious
i
said
she
wants
me
to
be
a
shepherdess
she
did
not
understand
and
frowned
a
shepherdess
she
said
what
do
you
mean
i
hurried
on
she
has
found
a
place
for
me
in
a
farm
and
i
am
to
milk
cows
and
look
after
the
pigs
sister
pushed
me
away
so
roughly
that
i
bumped
against
the
wall
she
ran
towards
the
door
i
thought
she
was
going
to
the
mother
superior
room
but
she
went
out
and
came
back
again
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
passage
taking
long
steps
her
fists
were
clenched
and
she
kept
tapping
with
her
foot
on
the
floor
she
was
breathing
hard
then
she
leaned
up
against
the
wall
let
her
arms
fall
as
though
she
were
overcome
and
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
a
long
way
off
she
said
she
is
revenging
herself
yes
she
is
revenging
herself
she
came
back
to
me
took
my
two
hands
affectionately
in
hers
and
asked
did
you
tell
her
that
you
would
not
go
did
you
beg
her
to
let
you
go
to
mademoiselle
maximilienne
i
shook
my
head
and
repeated
in
her
own
words
exactly
what
the
mother
superior
had
said
to
me
she
listened
without
interrupting
me
then
she
told
me
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
the
other
girls
she
thought
that
everything
would
be
all
right
when
le
curé
came
back
next
sunday
as
we
were
getting
into
line
to
go
to
mass
madeleine
ran
into
the
room
like
a
mad
thing
she
threw
her
arms
up
in
the
air
cried
out
le
curé
is
dead
and
fell
right
down
across
the
table
near
her
everybody
stopped
talking
and
we
all
ran
to
madeleine
who
was
screaming
and
crying
we
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
but
she
rocked
herself
up
and
down
on
the
table
and
kept
on
repeating
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
i
could
not
think
at
all
i
did
not
know
whether
i
was
sorry
or
not
and
all
the
time
mass
was
going
on
madeleine
voice
sounded
in
my
ears
like
a
bell
there
was
no
walk
that
day
even
the
little
girls
kept
quite
quiet
i
went
to
look
for
sister
she
had
not
been
at
mass
and
i
knew
from
marie
renaud
that
she
was
not
ill
i
found
her
in
the
refectory
she
was
sitting
on
her
little
platform
she
was
leaning
her
head
sideways
on
the
table
and
her
arms
were
hanging
down
beside
her
chair
i
sat
myself
down
some
distance
away
from
her
but
when
i
heard
her
moaning
i
began
to
sob
too
hiding
my
face
in
my
hands
but
i
did
not
sob
long
and
i
knew
that
i
was
not
as
sorry
as
i
wanted
to
be
i
tried
to
cry
but
i
could
not
shed
a
single
tear
i
was
a
little
bit
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
believed
that
one
ought
to
cry
when
somebody
died
and
i
did
dare
uncover
my
face
for
fear
that
sister
should
think
that
i
was
hard
hearted
i
listened
to
her
crying
her
moaning
reminded
me
of
the
wind
at
in
the
big
fireplace
it
went
up
and
down
as
if
she
were
trying
to
compose
a
kind
of
song
then
her
voice
stumbled
and
broke
and
ended
up
in
deep
trembling
notes
a
little
before
madeleine
came
into
the
refectory
she
took
sister
away
with
her
putting
her
arm
round
her
and
taking
care
of
her
as
they
walked
in
the
evening
she
told
us
that
le
curé
had
died
in
rome
and
that
he
would
be
brought
back
to
be
buried
with
his
family
next
day
sister
looked
after
us
as
usual
she
did
cry
any
more
but
she
would
not
let
us
talk
to
her
she
walked
along
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
me
i
had
only
one
day
more
as
the
mother
superior
had
told
me
i
should
be
fetched
next
day
for
the
day
after
was
the
feast
of
john
in
the
evening
at
the
end
of
prayers
when
sister
had
said
lord
be
pitiful
to
exiles
and
give
your
aid
to
prisoners
she
added
in
a
loud
voice
we
will
say
a
prayer
for
one
of
your
companions
who
is
going
out
into
the
world
i
understood
at
once
that
she
was
talking
of
me
and
i
felt
that
i
was
as
much
to
be
pitied
as
the
exiles
and
the
prisoners
were
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
that
night
i
knew
that
i
was
going
next
day
but
i
did
know
what
sologne
was
like
i
imagined
it
to
be
a
country
very
far
off
where
there
were
large
plains
with
flowers
on
them
i
imagined
myself
the
shepherdess
of
a
troop
of
beautiful
white
sheep
with
two
dogs
by
my
side
which
kept
the
sheep
in
order
at
a
sign
from
me
i
would
not
have
dared
to
tell
sister
so
but
just
then
i
liked
the
idea
of
being
a
shepherdess
much
better
than
the
idea
of
being
in
a
shop
ismérie
who
was
snoring
loud
next
to
me
reminded
me
of
my
comrades
again
it
was
such
a
bright
night
that
i
could
see
all
the
beds
quite
distinctly
i
looked
at
one
after
the
other
stopping
a
little
at
those
of
the
girls
i
was
fond
of
almost
opposite
me
i
saw
my
friend
sophie
with
her
magnificent
hair
it
was
scattered
about
over
the
pillow
and
lighted
up
the
bed
quite
brightly
a
little
further
down
the
room
were
the
beds
of
chemineau
the
proud
and
her
twin
sister
the
fool
chemineau
the
proud
had
a
big
smooth
white
forehead
and
gentle
eyes
she
never
said
it
was
not
true
when
she
was
accused
of
doing
anything
wrong
she
simply
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
looked
round
her
with
contempt
sister
used
to
say
that
her
conscience
was
as
white
as
her
forehead
chemineau
the
fool
was
half
as
tall
again
as
her
sister
her
hair
was
coarse
and
came
down
nearly
to
her
eyebrows
her
shoulders
were
square
and
her
hips
were
broad
we
used
to
call
her
the
sister
and
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
dormitory
was
colette
she
still
believed
that
i
was
going
to
mademoiselle
maximilienne
she
was
quite
sure
that
i
should
get
married
very
soon
and
she
had
made
me
promise
to
come
and
fetch
her
as
soon
as
i
was
married
i
thought
about
her
for
a
long
time
then
i
looked
at
the
window
and
the
shadows
of
the
linden
trees
were
thrown
in
my
direction
it
was
as
though
they
had
come
to
say
to
me
and
i
smiled
at
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
lindens
i
could
see
the
infirmary
it
looked
as
though
it
were
trying
to
hide
itself
and
its
little
windows
made
me
think
of
weak
eyes
i
looked
at
the
infirmary
for
some
time
thinking
of
sister
agatha
she
was
so
bright
and
so
good
that
the
little
girls
always
laughed
when
she
scolded
them
she
did
the
doctoring
when
one
of
us
went
to
her
with
a
bad
finger
she
always
had
something
funny
to
say
and
she
always
knew
whether
we
were
greedy
or
vain
and
would
promise
us
a
cake
or
a
ribbon
accordingly
she
used
to
pretend
to
look
for
it
and
while
we
were
looking
to
see
where
it
was
the
bad
place
on
the
finger
would
be
pricked
washed
and
tied
up
i
remember
a
chilblain
that
i
had
on
my
foot
which
would
not
get
well
one
morning
sister
agatha
said
to
me
solemnly
listen
marie
claire
i
must
put
something
miraculous
on
this
and
if
your
foot
is
not
better
in
three
days
we
shall
have
to
cut
it
off
for
three
days
i
was
very
careful
not
to
walk
on
that
foot
so
as
not
to
disturb
this
miraculous
something
i
thought
it
must
be
a
piece
of
the
true
cross
or
perhaps
a
piece
of
the
veil
of
the
holy
virgin
on
the
third
day
my
foot
was
completely
cured
and
when
i
asked
sister
agatha
what
the
miraculous
remedy
was
that
she
had
put
on
it
she
laughed
called
me
a
little
silly
and
showed
me
a
box
of
ointment
which
was
called
miraculous
ointment
it
was
late
at
night
when
i
went
to
sleep
and
i
began
to
expect
the
farmer
wife
directly
morning
came
i
wanted
her
to
come
and
i
was
afraid
of
her
coming
sister
looked
up
quickly
every
time
the
door
opened
just
as
we
were
finishing
dinner
the
porteress
came
and
asked
if
i
were
ready
to
go
sister
said
that
i
should
be
ready
in
a
moment
she
got
up
and
told
me
to
go
with
her
she
helped
me
to
dress
gave
me
a
little
bundle
of
linen
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
said
they
will
bring
him
back
and
you
will
not
be
there
then
she
looked
into
my
eyes
swear
to
me
she
said
that
you
will
say
a
for
him
every
night
i
promised
to
do
so
then
she
pulled
me
to
her
quite
roughly
pressed
me
to
her
hard
and
ran
off
to
her
room
i
heard
her
saying
as
she
went
my
god
this
is
too
much
i
crossed
the
courtyard
by
myself
and
the
farmer
wife
who
was
waiting
for
me
took
me
away
part
ii
i
was
tucked
in
among
a
lot
of
old
baskets
in
a
cart
covered
with
a
hood
and
when
the
horse
stopped
of
his
own
accord
at
the
farm
it
had
been
dark
for
a
long
time
the
farmer
came
out
of
the
house
carrying
a
lantern
which
he
held
high
up
in
the
air
and
which
only
lit
up
the
toes
of
his
wooden
shoes
he
came
and
helped
us
to
get
out
of
the
cart
then
he
lifted
his
lantern
up
to
my
face
stood
back
a
little
and
said
what
a
funny
little
servant
girl
his
wife
took
me
to
a
room
where
there
were
two
beds
she
showed
me
mine
and
told
me
that
i
should
be
all
alone
on
the
farm
with
the
cowherd
next
day
because
every
one
was
going
to
the
feast
of
john
as
soon
as
i
was
up
next
morning
the
cowherd
took
me
to
the
stables
to
help
him
give
the
fodder
to
the
cattle
he
showed
me
the
sheep
pens
and
told
me
that
i
was
going
to
look
after
the
lambs
instead
of
old
bibiche
he
explained
to
me
that
the
lambs
were
taken
from
their
mothers
every
year
and
that
a
special
shepherdess
was
needed
to
look
after
them
he
also
told
me
that
the
name
of
the
farm
was
villevieille
and
that
everybody
was
happy
there
because
master
silvain
the
farmer
and
pauline
his
wife
were
kind
people
when
he
had
seen
to
all
the
animals
the
cowherd
made
me
sit
down
next
to
him
in
the
chestnut
avenue
sitting
there
we
could
see
the
bend
in
the
lane
which
went
up
towards
the
and
the
whole
of
the
farm
the
farm
buildings
formed
a
square
and
the
huge
dunghill
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
gave
off
a
warm
smell
which
mixed
with
the
smell
of
the
hay
the
farm
was
wrapped
in
silence
i
sat
and
looked
all
round
me
i
could
see
nothing
but
pine
trees
and
corn
fields
i
felt
as
though
i
had
suddenly
been
dropped
into
a
faraway
country
where
i
should
always
remain
along
with
the
cowherd
and
the
animals
which
i
could
hear
moving
in
their
stables
it
was
very
hot
and
i
was
numb
with
a
heavy
longing
to
go
to
sleep
but
fear
of
all
the
new
things
which
were
round
me
prevented
me
from
letting
myself
drop
off
flies
of
all
possible
colours
whizzed
round
me
with
a
little
snoring
noise
the
cowherd
was
making
a
basket
of
rushes
and
the
dogs
lay
at
our
feet
fast
asleep
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
farmer
cart
turned
slowly
round
the
bend
in
the
lane
there
were
five
people
in
it
two
men
and
three
women
as
they
passed
us
the
farmer
wife
smiled
down
at
me
and
the
others
leaned
forward
to
see
me
soon
afterwards
the
farm
filled
with
noise
and
as
it
was
too
late
to
make
soup
for
supper
we
all
supped
off
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
bowl
of
milk
on
a
french
farm
the
farmer
is
always
called
master
next
day
the
farmer
wife
gave
me
a
cloak
and
i
went
out
with
old
bibiche
to
learn
how
to
look
after
the
lambs
old
bibiche
and
her
dog
castille
were
so
like
one
another
that
i
always
thought
they
must
belong
to
the
same
family
they
looked
about
the
same
age
and
their
eyes
were
about
the
same
colour
whenever
the
lambs
ran
off
the
path
bibiche
would
say
bark
castille
bark
she
said
it
very
quickly
almost
in
one
word
and
even
when
castille
did
not
bark
the
lambs
got
back
into
line
again
the
old
woman
voice
was
so
like
that
of
her
dog
when
harvesting
began
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
were
taking
part
in
something
full
of
mystery
men
went
up
to
the
corn
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
with
regular
sweeping
strokes
while
others
picked
it
up
again
in
sheaves
which
they
stacked
one
against
the
other
the
cries
of
the
harvesters
seemed
to
come
from
above
sometimes
and
every
now
and
then
i
looked
up
quickly
expecting
to
see
golden
chariots
fly
past
above
my
head
we
all
had
our
evening
meal
together
everybody
sat
down
where
they
pleased
at
the
long
table
and
the
farmer
wife
filled
our
plates
to
the
brim
the
younger
ones
munched
with
appetite
while
the
older
ones
cut
each
mouthful
as
though
it
were
something
precious
everybody
ate
in
silence
and
the
brown
bread
looked
whiter
in
their
black
hands
at
the
end
of
the
meal
the
elder
ones
talked
about
harvests
with
the
farmer
while
the
younger
ones
talked
and
laughed
with
martine
the
shepherdess
she
answered
everybody
jokes
and
laughed
heartily
at
them
but
if
one
of
the
men
stretched
out
a
hand
towards
her
she
skipped
out
of
the
way
and
never
let
him
get
hold
of
her
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
me
i
sat
on
a
pile
of
logs
a
little
way
away
from
the
rest
of
them
and
looked
at
all
their
faces
master
silvain
had
big
brown
eyes
which
looked
at
each
one
in
turn
and
rested
quietly
on
them
as
he
looked
he
never
raised
his
voice
and
leaned
his
open
hands
on
the
table
when
he
spoke
his
wife
voice
was
serious
and
she
always
looked
as
though
she
were
expecting
some
misfortune
to
happen
and
she
scarcely
smiled
at
all
even
when
all
the
others
were
roaring
with
laughter
old
bibiche
always
thought
that
i
was
falling
asleep
she
would
come
and
pull
my
sleeve
and
take
me
off
to
bed
her
bed
was
next
to
mine
she
mumbled
her
prayers
while
she
was
undressing
and
always
blew
the
lamp
out
without
waiting
to
see
whether
i
was
ready
directly
after
the
harvest
bibiche
let
me
go
to
the
fields
alone
with
her
dog
old
castille
did
care
for
my
company
she
used
to
leave
me
whenever
she
could
and
go
back
to
the
farm
to
bibiche
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
in
keeping
my
lambs
together
they
ran
every
way
at
once
i
compared
myself
to
sister
who
always
said
that
her
little
flock
was
hard
to
manage
and
yet
she
used
to
get
us
together
at
one
stroke
of
the
bell
and
she
could
always
make
us
perfectly
quiet
by
raising
her
voice
a
little
but
i
might
raise
my
voice
or
crack
my
whip
as
much
as
i
liked
the
lambs
did
not
understand
me
and
i
was
obliged
to
run
about
all
round
the
flock
as
though
i
were
a
sheep
dog
one
evening
two
lambs
were
missing
i
always
stood
in
the
doorway
every
evening
to
let
them
in
one
by
one
so
that
i
could
count
them
easily
i
went
into
the
pen
and
tried
to
count
them
again
it
was
not
easy
and
i
had
to
give
it
up
at
last
for
every
time
i
counted
them
again
i
made
their
number
more
than
there
really
were
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
must
have
counted
them
wrong
the
first
time
and
i
did
not
say
anything
to
anybody
next
morning
when
i
let
them
out
i
counted
them
once
more
there
really
were
two
missing
i
felt
very
uneasy
all
day
long
i
hunted
about
the
fields
for
them
and
in
the
evening
when
i
was
quite
certain
that
they
were
missing
i
told
the
farmer
wife
we
searched
high
and
low
for
those
lambs
for
several
days
but
we
could
not
find
them
the
farmer
first
and
then
his
wife
took
me
apart
and
tried
to
make
me
confess
that
men
had
come
and
taken
the
lambs
away
they
promised
me
that
i
should
not
be
scolded
if
i
would
tell
the
truth
it
was
no
good
my
saying
that
i
really
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
them
i
could
see
that
they
did
not
believe
me
after
this
i
was
frightened
when
i
went
into
the
fields
because
i
knew
now
that
there
were
men
who
hid
themselves
and
came
and
stole
the
sheep
i
was
always
thinking
that
i
saw
some
one
moving
about
behind
the
bushes
i
very
soon
learned
to
count
my
lambs
by
glancing
at
them
and
whether
they
were
all
together
or
scattered
about
i
knew
in
a
minute
whether
all
of
them
were
there
autumn
came
and
i
began
to
feel
unhappy
i
missed
sister
i
longed
so
to
see
her
that
i
used
to
shut
my
eyes
and
believe
that
she
was
coming
up
the
path
when
i
did
this
i
could
really
hear
her
steps
and
the
rustling
of
her
dress
on
the
grass
when
i
felt
her
quite
close
to
me
i
opened
my
eyes
and
she
disappeared
at
once
for
a
long
time
i
had
the
idea
of
writing
to
her
but
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
pen
and
paper
the
farmer
wife
did
not
know
how
to
write
and
nobody
at
the
farm
ever
got
any
letters
i
plucked
up
courage
one
day
and
asked
master
silvain
if
he
would
take
me
to
town
with
him
that
morning
he
did
answer
at
once
his
big
quiet
eyes
rested
on
me
for
a
time
and
then
he
said
that
a
shepherdess
ought
never
to
leave
her
flock
he
said
that
he
did
mind
taking
me
to
mass
in
the
village
now
and
then
but
that
i
must
not
expect
him
to
take
me
to
the
town
this
answer
quite
stunned
me
it
was
as
though
i
had
learned
of
a
great
misfortune
and
every
time
i
thought
of
it
i
could
see
sister
she
was
like
some
precious
thing
which
the
farmer
had
smashed
all
to
pieces
by
accident
on
the
following
saturday
master
silvain
and
his
wife
left
in
the
morning
as
usual
but
instead
of
remaining
in
town
until
evening
they
came
back
in
the
afternoon
with
a
dealer
who
wanted
to
buy
some
of
the
lambs
i
had
never
thought
that
one
could
go
to
the
town
and
come
back
again
in
so
short
a
time
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
one
day
i
would
leave
my
lambs
in
the
meadow
and
would
run
into
the
town
for
one
kiss
from
sister
i
soon
found
that
that
would
not
be
possible
and
i
decided
to
go
off
in
the
night
i
hoped
that
i
should
not
take
much
longer
that
the
farmer
horse
did
and
that
by
leaving
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
could
be
back
in
time
to
take
the
lambs
to
pasture
in
the
morning
that
evening
i
went
to
bed
in
my
clothes
and
when
the
big
clock
sounded
twelve
i
slipped
out
on
with
my
shoes
in
my
hand
i
leaned
against
a
cart
and
laced
them
up
and
ran
off
as
fast
as
i
could
into
the
dark
i
soon
got
past
the
outbuildings
of
the
farm
and
then
i
saw
that
the
night
was
not
very
dark
the
wind
was
blowing
very
hard
and
big
black
clouds
were
rolling
across
the
sky
under
the
moon
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
and
to
get
there
i
had
to
cross
a
wooden
bridge
which
was
out
of
repair
the
rain
of
the
last
few
days
had
swelled
the
little
river
and
the
water
splashed
up
on
to
the
bridge
through
the
rotten
planks
i
began
to
get
nervous
because
the
water
and
the
wind
between
them
made
a
noise
that
i
had
never
heard
before
but
i
refused
to
be
frightened
and
ran
across
the
slippery
bridge
as
quickly
as
i
dared
i
got
to
the
sooner
than
i
had
expected
to
and
i
turned
to
the
left
as
i
had
seen
the
farmer
turn
when
he
went
to
market
but
a
little
further
along
the
road
divided
into
two
and
i
did
know
which
road
to
take
i
ran
a
little
way
up
one
road
and
then
a
little
way
up
another
it
was
the
road
to
the
left
that
seemed
to
be
the
likely
one
i
took
it
and
walked
fast
to
make
up
for
lost
time
in
the
distance
i
saw
a
black
mass
which
covered
the
whole
country
it
seemed
to
be
coming
slowly
towards
me
and
for
a
moment
i
wanted
to
turn
back
and
run
a
dog
began
to
bark
and
that
gave
me
a
little
confidence
and
almost
directly
afterwards
i
saw
that
the
black
mass
in
front
of
me
was
a
wood
through
which
the
road
passed
when
i
got
into
it
the
wind
seemed
to
be
rougher
than
ever
it
blew
in
gusts
and
the
trees
struck
at
one
another
and
rattled
their
branches
and
moaned
and
stooped
down
to
get
out
of
its
way
i
heard
long
whistling
sounds
as
the
branches
cracked
and
clattered
and
fell
then
i
heard
steps
behind
me
and
felt
a
tap
on
my
shoulder
i
turned
round
quickly
but
i
saw
nobody
yet
i
was
sure
that
somebody
had
touched
me
with
his
finger
and
the
steps
went
on
as
though
some
invisible
person
were
walking
round
and
round
me
i
began
to
run
so
fast
that
i
did
know
whether
my
feet
were
touching
the
ground
or
not
the
stones
sprang
out
under
my
shoes
and
rattled
behind
me
like
a
little
hailstorm
i
had
only
one
idea
and
that
was
to
run
and
run
until
i
got
out
of
the
forest
at
last
i
came
to
a
clearing
it
was
lit
up
by
a
pale
moon
and
the
tearing
wind
whirled
heaps
of
leaves
up
and
threw
them
down
again
then
rolled
them
about
and
about
and
turned
them
over
in
all
directions
i
wanted
to
stop
to
get
my
breath
but
the
big
trees
were
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
deafening
noise
their
shadows
which
looked
like
great
black
animals
threw
themselves
flat
along
the
road
and
then
slipped
away
and
hid
behind
the
trees
some
of
these
shadows
had
shapes
which
i
recognized
but
most
of
them
hovered
and
jumped
about
in
front
of
me
as
though
they
wanted
to
prevent
me
from
passing
some
of
them
frightened
me
so
that
i
took
a
little
run
and
jumped
over
them
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
that
they
would
catch
at
my
feet
the
wind
went
down
a
little
and
rain
began
to
fall
in
large
drops
i
had
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
and
when
i
came
to
a
little
path
which
disappeared
into
the
wood
again
i
saw
a
white
wall
at
the
end
of
it
i
went
a
little
way
along
the
path
and
saw
that
it
was
a
house
without
thinking
at
all
i
knocked
at
the
door
i
wanted
to
ask
the
people
to
shelter
me
until
the
wind
stopped
i
knocked
a
second
time
and
heard
somebody
moving
i
thought
the
door
was
going
to
be
opened
but
a
window
was
opened
on
the
first
floor
a
man
in
a
called
out
who
is
there
i
answered
a
little
girl
he
seemed
surprised
a
little
girl
he
said
and
asked
me
where
i
came
from
where
i
was
going
and
what
i
wanted
i
had
not
expected
all
these
questions
and
i
said
that
i
had
come
from
the
farm
but
then
told
a
lie
and
said
that
i
was
going
to
see
my
mother
who
was
ill
i
asked
him
to
let
me
into
the
house
until
the
rain
stopped
he
told
me
to
wait
and
i
heard
him
talking
to
somebody
else
then
he
came
back
to
the
window
and
asked
me
if
there
was
anybody
with
me
he
asked
me
how
old
i
was
and
when
i
said
i
was
thirteen
he
said
i
must
be
a
brave
girl
to
come
through
the
wood
alone
at
night
he
remained
leaning
out
of
the
window
a
moment
trying
to
see
my
face
which
was
looking
up
towards
him
then
he
turned
his
head
to
right
and
left
trying
to
look
into
the
darkness
of
the
wood
and
advised
me
to
go
on
a
little
further
there
was
a
village
at
the
other
side
of
the
wood
he
said
and
i
should
find
houses
there
where
i
could
dry
my
clothes
i
went
on
into
the
night
the
moon
had
hidden
itself
altogether
and
a
drizzling
rain
was
falling
i
had
to
walk
a
long
time
before
i
got
to
the
village
all
the
houses
were
shut
up
and
i
could
hardly
see
them
in
the
dark
a
blacksmith
was
the
only
person
up
when
i
got
to
his
house
i
went
up
the
two
steps
meaning
to
rest
there
he
was
busy
with
a
great
iron
bar
which
he
was
heating
in
a
fire
of
red
coal
and
when
his
arm
went
up
with
the
bellows
he
looked
like
a
giant
every
time
the
bellows
came
down
the
coal
flew
up
and
crackled
that
made
a
glimmering
light
which
lit
up
the
walls
on
which
scythes
saws
and
all
kinds
of
knives
were
hanging
the
man
forehead
was
wrinkled
and
he
was
staring
at
the
fire
i
dared
not
talk
to
him
and
i
went
away
without
making
any
noise
when
it
became
quite
light
i
saw
that
i
was
not
very
far
from
the
town
i
began
to
recognize
the
places
where
sister
used
to
take
us
when
we
went
for
our
walks
i
was
walking
very
slowly
now
and
dragged
my
feet
after
me
because
they
hurt
me
i
was
so
tired
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
heaps
of
stone
which
were
on
each
side
of
the
road
the
sound
of
a
horse
and
cart
rattling
along
the
road
as
fast
as
they
could
go
made
me
turn
round
and
i
remained
standing
quite
still
with
my
heart
beating
fast
i
had
recognized
the
bay
mare
and
the
black
beard
he
stopped
the
mare
quite
close
to
me
leaned
out
of
the
cart
and
lifted
me
up
into
it
by
the
belt
of
my
dress
he
sat
me
down
next
to
him
on
the
seat
turned
the
horse
round
and
drove
off
again
at
full
speed
when
we
got
to
the
wood
master
silvain
made
the
horse
slow
down
he
turned
to
me
looked
at
me
and
said
it
is
lucky
for
you
that
i
caught
you
up
otherwise
you
would
have
been
brought
back
to
the
farm
between
two
gensdarmes
as
i
did
answer
he
said
again
perhaps
you
do
know
that
there
are
gensdarmes
who
bring
little
girls
back
when
they
run
away
i
said
i
want
to
go
and
see
sister
are
you
unhappy
with
us
he
asked
i
said
again
i
want
to
go
and
see
sister
he
looked
as
though
he
understand
and
went
on
asking
me
questions
going
over
the
names
of
everybody
on
the
farm
and
asking
me
if
they
were
kind
to
me
i
made
the
same
answer
every
time
at
last
he
lost
patience
with
me
sat
straight
up
and
said
what
an
obstinate
child
i
looked
up
at
him
and
said
that
i
should
run
away
again
if
he
would
not
take
me
to
sister
i
went
on
looking
at
him
waiting
for
an
answer
and
i
could
see
quite
well
that
he
did
know
what
to
say
he
kept
still
and
thought
for
several
minutes
then
he
put
his
hand
on
my
knee
and
said
listen
to
me
child
and
try
and
understand
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
and
when
he
had
finished
speaking
i
understood
that
he
had
promised
to
keep
me
until
i
was
eighteen
without
ever
letting
me
go
to
the
town
i
understood
too
that
the
mother
superior
could
do
what
she
liked
with
me
and
that
if
i
ran
away
again
she
would
have
me
locked
up
because
i
ran
about
the
woods
during
the
night
then
the
farmer
said
that
he
hoped
i
should
forget
the
convent
and
that
i
should
grow
fond
of
him
and
of
his
wife
because
they
wished
me
to
be
happy
with
them
i
was
very
miserable
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
cry
come
said
the
farmer
holding
out
his
hand
let
us
be
good
friends
shall
we
i
put
my
hand
into
his
and
he
held
it
rather
tight
i
said
i
should
like
to
be
friends
he
cracked
his
whip
and
we
soon
got
through
the
wood
rain
was
still
falling
in
a
fine
shower
like
a
fog
and
the
ploughed
fields
looked
drearier
than
ever
in
a
field
by
the
road
a
man
came
towards
us
waving
his
arms
i
thought
he
was
threatening
me
at
first
but
when
he
was
quite
close
to
us
i
saw
that
he
was
holding
something
in
his
left
arm
and
that
his
right
arm
was
moving
up
and
down
as
though
he
were
working
a
scythe
i
was
so
puzzled
that
i
looked
at
master
silvain
as
though
he
were
answering
a
question
he
said
it
is
gaboret
sowing
a
few
minutes
afterwards
we
got
to
the
farm
the
farmer
wife
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
doorway
when
she
saw
me
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
as
though
she
had
been
a
long
time
without
breathing
and
her
serious
face
looked
a
little
less
anxious
for
a
moment
i
ran
past
her
went
into
the
room
to
fetch
my
cloak
and
went
straight
out
to
the
pens
the
sheep
rushed
out
tumbling
over
one
another
they
ought
to
have
been
in
the
fields
a
long
time
before
all
day
long
i
thought
over
what
the
farmer
had
said
to
me
i
could
not
understand
why
the
mother
superior
wanted
to
prevent
me
from
seeing
sister
i
understood
that
sister
could
do
nothing
though
and
i
made
my
mind
up
to
wait
thinking
that
a
day
would
come
when
nobody
could
prevent
me
from
seeing
her
again
at
bedtime
the
farmer
wife
went
up
with
me
to
put
an
extra
blanket
on
my
bed
and
when
she
had
said
good
night
she
told
me
not
to
call
her
madame
any
more
she
wanted
me
to
call
her
pauline
then
she
went
away
after
telling
me
that
both
she
and
her
husband
looked
upon
me
as
a
child
of
the
house
and
that
she
would
do
all
she
could
to
make
me
happy
at
the
farm
next
day
master
silvain
made
me
sit
next
to
his
brother
at
table
he
told
him
with
a
laugh
that
he
was
not
to
let
me
want
for
anything
because
he
wanted
me
to
grow
the
farmer
brother
was
called
eugène
he
spoke
very
little
but
he
always
looked
at
each
person
who
spoke
and
his
little
eyes
often
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
them
he
was
thirty
years
old
but
he
did
not
look
more
than
twenty
he
always
had
an
answer
to
any
question
he
was
asked
and
i
felt
no
awkwardness
at
sitting
next
to
him
he
squeezed
himself
against
the
wall
so
as
to
give
me
more
room
at
the
table
and
when
the
farmer
told
him
to
look
after
me
all
he
said
was
you
need
not
worry
now
after
all
the
fields
had
been
ploughed
martine
took
her
sheep
a
long
way
off
to
some
pasture
land
called
the
common
the
cowherd
and
i
took
our
flock
down
the
meadows
and
into
the
woods
where
there
was
fern
i
suffered
from
the
cold
although
i
had
a
big
woollen
cloak
which
covered
me
down
to
my
feet
the
cowherd
often
had
to
light
a
fire
he
would
bake
potatoes
and
chestnuts
in
the
ashes
and
share
them
with
me
he
taught
me
how
to
know
from
which
side
the
wind
was
coming
so
as
to
make
use
of
the
least
shelter
against
the
cold
and
as
we
sat
over
the
fire
and
tried
to
keep
ourselves
warm
he
would
sing
me
a
song
about
water
and
wine
it
was
a
song
which
had
about
twenty
verses
in
it
water
and
wine
accused
one
another
of
ruining
the
human
race
and
at
the
same
time
praised
themselves
tremendously
as
far
as
i
could
see
water
was
right
but
the
cowherd
said
that
wine
was
not
wrong
we
used
to
sit
and
talk
together
for
hours
he
would
tell
me
of
his
own
home
which
was
a
long
way
off
from
sologne
he
told
me
that
he
had
always
been
a
cowherd
and
that
when
he
was
a
child
a
bull
had
knocked
him
down
and
hurt
him
he
had
been
ill
a
long
time
after
that
and
the
pains
in
his
limbs
had
made
him
scream
then
the
pains
had
gone
away
but
he
had
become
all
twisted
up
as
i
saw
him
now
he
remembered
the
names
of
all
the
farms
where
he
had
been
cowherd
some
of
the
farmers
were
kind
and
some
were
not
but
he
had
never
come
across
such
kind
masters
as
at
villevieille
he
said
too
that
master
silvain
cows
were
not
a
bit
like
those
of
his
own
country
which
were
small
and
had
horns
like
pointed
spindles
the
villevieille
cows
were
big
strong
animals
with
rough
crumpled
horns
he
was
very
fond
of
them
and
used
to
call
each
one
by
name
when
he
talked
to
them
the
one
he
liked
best
was
a
beautiful
white
cow
which
master
silvain
had
bought
in
the
spring
she
was
always
lifting
her
head
and
looking
into
the
distance
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
would
start
off
at
a
run
the
cowherd
used
to
call
out
stop
where
you
are
blanche
stop
she
usually
obeyed
him
but
sometimes
he
had
to
send
the
dog
after
her
sometimes
too
she
used
to
try
and
run
even
when
the
dog
stopped
her
and
would
only
come
back
to
the
herd
when
the
dog
bit
her
muzzle
the
cowherd
used
to
pity
her
because
he
said
he
could
say
what
or
whom
she
was
regretting
in
the
month
of
december
the
cows
remained
in
the
stables
i
thought
that
we
should
keep
the
sheep
in
too
but
the
farmer
brother
explained
to
me
that
sologne
was
a
very
poor
country
and
that
the
farmers
could
not
make
enough
forage
to
feed
the
sheep
as
well
so
now
i
used
to
go
off
all
by
myself
with
the
sheep
down
the
meadows
and
into
the
woods
all
the
birds
had
gone
mist
spread
over
the
ploughed
fields
and
the
woods
were
full
of
silence
there
were
days
when
i
felt
so
lonely
that
i
began
to
believe
that
the
earth
had
fallen
all
to
pieces
round
me
and
when
a
crow
cawed
as
it
flew
past
in
the
grey
sky
its
great
hoarse
voice
seemed
to
me
to
be
singing
of
the
misfortunes
of
the
world
even
the
sheep
were
quiet
a
dealer
had
taken
away
all
the
lambs
and
the
little
ewes
did
not
know
how
to
play
alone
they
went
along
pressing
up
close
to
each
other
and
even
when
they
were
not
cropping
what
grass
there
was
their
heads
were
bent
some
of
them
made
me
think
of
little
girls
i
had
known
i
used
to
pass
them
and
stroke
them
and
make
them
raise
their
heads
but
their
eyes
looked
down
again
at
once
and
the
pupils
were
like
glass
without
a
gleam
in
it
one
day
i
was
surprised
by
such
a
thick
fog
that
i
could
not
see
my
way
all
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
near
a
big
wood
which
i
know
the
tops
of
the
trees
were
lost
in
the
fog
and
the
ferns
looked
as
though
they
were
all
wrapped
in
wool
white
shadows
came
down
from
the
trees
and
glided
with
long
transparent
trains
over
the
dead
leaves
i
pushed
the
sheep
towards
the
meadow
which
was
quite
near
but
they
clustered
together
and
refused
to
go
on
i
went
in
front
of
them
to
see
what
was
preventing
them
from
going
any
further
and
i
recognized
the
little
river
which
flowed
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
i
could
scarcely
see
the
water
it
seemed
to
be
sleeping
under
a
thick
white
woollen
blanket
i
stood
looking
at
it
for
one
long
minute
then
i
got
my
sheep
together
and
took
them
back
along
the
road
while
i
was
trying
to
find
out
where
the
farm
was
the
sheep
ran
round
the
wood
and
got
into
a
lane
with
a
hedge
on
each
side
of
it
the
fog
was
getting
thicker
than
ever
and
i
thought
i
was
walking
between
two
high
walls
i
followed
the
sheep
without
knowing
where
they
were
taking
me
suddenly
they
left
the
lane
and
turned
to
the
right
but
i
stopped
them
i
saw
a
church
just
in
front
of
us
the
doors
were
wide
open
and
on
either
side
i
could
see
two
red
lamps
which
lit
up
a
grey
vaulted
roof
there
were
two
straight
lines
of
huge
pillars
and
at
the
other
end
one
could
just
see
the
windows
with
their
small
panes
on
which
a
light
was
shining
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
the
sheep
from
going
into
the
church
and
as
i
was
pushing
them
away
i
noticed
that
they
were
covered
with
little
white
beads
they
shook
themselves
every
moment
and
the
beads
made
a
tinkling
sound
i
got
very
anxious
for
i
knew
that
master
silvain
must
be
waiting
for
us
and
wondering
where
we
were
i
felt
sure
that
if
i
were
to
go
back
the
way
i
had
come
i
must
soon
find
the
farm
so
making
as
little
noise
as
i
could
i
pushed
the
sheep
back
into
the
lane
which
led
to
the
church
as
i
was
going
into
the
lane
a
man
voice
sounded
right
over
my
head
the
voice
said
let
the
poor
brutes
go
home
as
he
spoke
the
man
turned
the
sheep
back
towards
the
church
again
and
i
recognized
eugène
the
farmer
brother
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
back
of
one
of
the
sheep
and
said
how
pretty
they
are
with
their
little
frost
balls
but
it
is
not
good
for
them
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
meeting
him
there
i
showed
him
the
church
and
asked
him
what
it
was
it
was
for
you
he
said
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
not
find
the
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
and
i
hung
up
a
lantern
on
each
side
i
felt
all
confused
it
was
only
a
few
moments
afterwards
that
i
understood
that
the
great
pillars
blackened
and
worn
by
centuries
were
simply
the
trunks
of
the
chestnut
trees
and
then
i
recognized
the
windows
of
the
farmhouse
kitchen
which
the
fire
lit
up
from
inside
eugène
counted
the
sheep
himself
he
helped
me
to
make
them
a
warm
litter
of
straw
and
as
we
left
the
pen
together
he
asked
me
if
i
really
did
know
what
had
become
of
the
two
lambs
that
had
been
lost
i
felt
dreadfully
ashamed
at
the
thought
that
he
could
believe
that
i
had
told
a
lie
and
i
could
not
help
crying
and
told
him
that
they
had
disappeared
without
my
having
seen
how
or
where
they
went
then
he
told
me
that
he
had
found
them
drowned
in
a
i
thought
he
was
going
to
scold
me
for
not
having
watched
them
better
but
he
said
gently
go
and
get
warm
you
have
got
all
the
rime
of
sologne
in
your
hair
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
and
see
the
waterhole
but
during
the
night
snow
fell
so
quickly
that
we
could
go
out
to
the
fields
next
day
i
helped
old
bibiche
to
mend
the
household
linen
martine
sat
down
to
her
spinning
wheel
and
i
sang
to
them
while
we
sewed
and
martine
span
while
we
sat
at
work
that
evening
the
dogs
never
stopped
barking
martine
seemed
anxious
she
listened
to
the
dogs
and
then
turning
to
the
farmer
she
said
i
am
afraid
this
weather
will
bring
the
wolves
down
the
farmer
got
up
to
go
out
and
talk
to
the
dogs
and
took
his
lantern
to
make
a
round
of
the
outhouses
during
the
week
that
the
snow
lasted
hundreds
of
crows
came
to
the
farm
they
were
so
hungry
that
nothing
frightened
them
they
went
into
the
and
the
pens
and
into
the
granary
and
they
made
very
free
with
the
corn
ricks
the
farmer
killed
a
lot
of
them
we
cooked
some
of
them
with
bacon
and
cabbage
everybody
thought
them
very
good
but
the
dogs
would
eat
them
the
first
day
we
let
the
sheep
and
cows
out
the
pine
trees
were
still
heavy
with
snow
the
hill
was
all
white
too
it
seemed
to
have
come
closer
to
the
farm
all
this
white
dazzled
me
i
could
not
find
things
in
their
places
and
every
moment
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
not
see
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
over
the
farm
roofs
any
longer
the
sheep
could
not
find
anything
to
eat
and
ran
about
searching
i
did
not
let
them
scatter
too
much
they
looked
like
moving
snow
and
i
was
obliged
to
watch
them
closely
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
them
i
managed
to
get
them
together
in
a
meadow
which
skirted
a
big
wood
the
whole
forest
was
busy
getting
rid
of
the
snow
which
weighed
it
down
the
big
branches
threw
the
snow
off
at
one
shake
while
the
others
which
were
not
so
strong
stooped
and
bent
themselves
to
make
it
slip
down
i
had
never
been
into
this
forest
i
only
knew
that
it
was
a
very
big
one
and
that
martine
sometimes
took
her
sheep
there
the
pine
trees
were
very
tall
and
the
ferns
grew
very
high
i
had
been
watching
a
big
clump
of
ferns
for
a
long
time
i
thought
i
had
seen
it
move
and
i
heard
a
sound
come
out
of
it
as
though
a
bit
of
stick
had
broken
under
a
footstep
i
felt
frightened
i
thought
there
was
somebody
there
then
i
heard
the
same
sound
again
much
nearer
but
without
seeing
anything
move
i
tried
to
reassure
myself
by
saying
to
myself
that
it
was
a
hare
or
some
other
little
animal
which
was
looking
for
food
but
in
spite
of
all
i
could
try
to
think
i
felt
there
was
somebody
there
i
felt
so
nervous
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
nearer
the
farm
i
had
taken
two
steps
towards
my
sheep
when
they
huddled
together
and
moved
away
from
the
wood
i
was
looking
about
to
see
what
had
frightened
them
when
quite
close
to
me
in
the
very
middle
of
the
flock
i
saw
a
yellow
dog
carrying
off
one
of
the
sheep
in
his
mouth
my
first
idea
was
that
castille
had
gone
mad
but
at
the
same
moment
castille
tumbled
up
against
my
dress
and
howled
plaintively
then
i
guessed
that
it
was
a
wolf
it
was
carrying
off
a
sheep
which
it
held
by
the
middle
of
its
body
it
climbed
up
a
hillock
without
any
difficulty
and
as
it
jumped
the
broad
ditch
which
separated
the
field
from
the
forest
its
hind
legs
made
me
think
of
wings
at
that
moment
i
should
not
have
thought
it
at
all
extraordinary
if
it
had
flown
away
over
the
trees
i
stood
there
for
a
few
moments
without
knowing
whether
i
was
frightened
then
i
felt
that
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
away
from
the
ditch
my
eyelids
had
become
so
stiff
that
i
thought
i
should
never
be
able
to
close
them
again
i
wanted
to
call
out
so
that
they
should
hear
me
at
the
farm
but
i
could
not
get
my
voice
out
of
my
throat
i
wanted
to
run
but
my
legs
were
trembling
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
the
wet
grass
castille
went
on
howling
as
though
she
were
in
pain
and
the
sheep
remained
huddled
together
when
i
got
them
back
to
the
farm
at
last
i
ran
to
look
for
master
silvain
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
guessed
what
had
happened
he
called
his
brother
and
took
down
their
two
guns
and
i
tried
to
show
him
which
way
the
wolf
had
gone
they
both
came
back
at
nightfall
without
having
found
him
we
talked
of
nothing
else
all
the
evening
eugène
wanted
to
know
what
the
wolf
looked
like
and
old
bibiche
got
angry
when
i
said
that
he
had
a
long
yellow
coat
like
castille
but
that
he
was
much
handsomer
than
she
was
a
few
days
afterwards
it
was
martine
turn
she
had
just
taken
her
sheep
out
and
she
had
hardly
reached
the
end
of
the
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
when
we
heard
her
shouting
everybody
rushed
out
of
the
house
i
got
to
martine
first
she
was
stooping
down
and
pulling
as
hard
as
she
could
at
a
sheep
which
a
wolf
had
just
killed
and
was
trying
to
carry
off
the
wolf
had
the
sheep
by
the
throat
and
was
pulling
as
hard
as
martine
was
martine
dog
bit
the
wolf
legs
but
he
seem
to
feel
it
and
when
master
silvain
fired
full
at
him
he
rolled
over
with
a
piece
of
the
sheep
throat
between
his
teeth
eyes
were
staring
and
her
mouth
had
become
quite
white
her
cap
had
slipped
off
her
head
and
the
parting
which
divided
her
hair
into
two
made
me
think
of
a
broad
path
on
which
one
could
walk
without
any
danger
the
usual
strong
expression
of
her
face
had
changed
into
a
sad
little
grimace
and
her
hands
kept
opening
and
closing
the
two
of
them
keeping
time
she
had
been
leaning
against
the
chestnut
tree
and
she
went
up
to
eugène
who
was
looking
at
the
wolf
she
stood
by
him
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
dead
wolf
too
and
said
aloud
poor
brute
how
hungry
he
must
have
been
the
farmer
put
the
wolf
and
the
sheep
on
the
same
wheelbarrow
and
wheeled
them
back
to
the
farm
the
dogs
followed
sniffing
at
the
barrow
and
looking
frightened
for
several
days
the
farmer
and
his
brother
went
out
shooting
in
the
neighbourhood
whenever
eugène
came
anywhere
near
me
he
would
stop
and
say
a
kind
word
he
told
me
that
the
noise
they
made
with
their
guns
drove
the
wolves
away
and
that
one
very
rarely
saw
any
in
that
part
of
the
country
but
although
he
said
that
there
was
little
or
no
danger
i
did
dare
go
back
to
the
big
forest
i
preferred
to
go
up
on
to
the
hill
which
was
covered
only
with
broom
and
ferns
it
the
beginning
of
the
spring
the
farmer
wife
taught
me
how
to
milk
the
cows
and
look
after
the
pigs
she
said
she
wanted
to
make
a
good
farmer
of
me
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
mother
superior
and
the
disdainful
tone
in
which
she
had
said
to
me
you
will
milk
the
cows
and
look
after
the
pigs
when
she
said
that
she
said
it
as
though
she
were
giving
me
a
punishment
and
here
i
was
delighted
at
having
them
to
look
after
i
used
to
lean
my
forehead
against
a
cow
flank
to
get
a
better
purchase
and
i
very
soon
filled
my
pail
at
the
top
of
the
milk
a
foam
used
to
form
which
caught
all
kinds
of
changing
colours
and
when
the
sun
passed
over
it
it
became
so
marvellously
beautiful
that
i
was
never
tired
of
looking
at
it
looking
after
the
pigs
never
disgusted
me
their
food
was
boiled
potatoes
and
curdled
milk
i
used
to
dip
my
hands
into
the
bucket
to
mix
it
all
up
and
i
loved
making
them
wait
for
their
food
a
few
minutes
their
eager
cries
and
the
way
they
wriggled
their
snouts
about
always
amused
me
when
may
came
master
silvain
added
a
she
goat
to
my
flock
he
had
bought
it
to
help
pauline
to
feed
the
little
baby
she
had
got
after
they
had
been
married
ten
years
this
goat
was
more
difficult
to
take
care
of
than
all
the
rest
of
the
flock
it
was
always
her
fault
when
my
flock
got
into
the
standing
oats
which
were
pretty
high
the
farmer
saw
what
had
happened
and
scolded
me
he
said
that
i
must
have
been
asleep
in
a
corner
while
my
sheep
were
trampling
his
oats
down
every
day
i
had
to
pass
near
a
wood
of
young
pine
trees
the
goat
used
to
get
there
in
three
jumps
and
it
was
while
i
was
looking
for
her
that
my
lambs
got
into
the
oats
the
first
time
i
waited
ever
so
long
for
her
to
come
back
by
herself
i
made
my
voice
as
soft
as
i
could
and
called
to
her
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
fetch
her
but
the
young
pines
were
so
close
together
that
i
did
know
how
to
get
after
her
on
the
other
hand
i
could
not
go
away
without
knowing
what
had
happened
to
the
goat
i
thought
i
remembered
the
place
where
she
had
disappeared
and
i
went
in
there
putting
my
hands
in
front
of
my
face
to
keep
the
thorns
off
i
saw
her
almost
at
once
through
my
fingers
she
was
quite
near
me
i
stretched
my
hands
out
to
get
hold
of
one
of
her
horns
but
she
backed
through
the
branches
which
flew
back
and
struck
me
in
the
face
at
last
however
i
got
hold
of
her
and
brought
her
back
to
the
flock
she
began
again
next
day
and
every
day
she
did
the
same
thing
i
got
my
sheep
as
far
away
as
i
could
from
the
oats
and
rushed
after
her
she
was
a
white
goat
and
the
first
time
i
saw
her
i
thought
that
she
was
like
madeleine
she
had
the
same
kind
of
eyes
set
far
away
from
each
other
when
i
forced
her
to
come
out
of
the
pine
trees
she
looked
at
me
for
a
long
time
without
moving
her
eyes
and
i
thought
that
madeleine
must
have
been
turned
into
a
goat
sometimes
i
told
her
not
to
do
it
again
and
i
was
quite
sure
that
she
understood
me
when
i
told
her
how
unkind
she
was
as
i
was
struggling
out
of
the
pine
wood
my
hair
fell
all
about
me
and
i
shook
my
head
to
throw
it
forward
the
goat
sprang
to
one
side
bleating
with
fear
she
lowered
her
horns
and
came
at
me
but
i
lowered
my
head
and
shook
my
hair
at
her
my
hair
was
long
and
dragged
along
the
ground
she
rushed
off
leaping
this
way
and
that
every
time
she
went
into
the
pine
wood
i
took
my
revenge
on
her
by
frightening
her
with
my
hair
master
silvain
surprised
us
one
morning
when
i
was
butting
at
her
he
laughed
and
laughed
till
i
did
know
which
way
to
look
i
tried
to
throw
my
hair
back
quickly
the
she
goat
came
close
up
to
me
she
looked
at
me
stretching
her
neck
and
wriggling
her
back
about
in
the
funniest
way
the
farmer
could
not
stop
laughing
he
bent
almost
double
holding
his
sides
and
simply
roared
with
laughter
all
i
could
see
of
him
were
his
eyebrows
his
beard
and
his
big
hat
his
shouts
of
laughter
made
me
want
to
cry
when
he
had
stopped
laughing
he
asked
me
all
about
it
i
told
him
how
wicked
the
goat
had
been
and
he
shook
his
finger
at
her
and
laughed
again
martine
took
her
out
next
day
but
the
day
after
she
said
that
she
would
rather
leave
the
farm
than
take
out
that
she
goat
again
it
was
possessed
of
the
devil
she
said
old
bibiche
used
to
say
that
goats
ought
to
be
beaten
but
i
remembered
the
only
time
i
had
beaten
mine
her
ribs
had
made
such
a
strange
hollow
sound
that
i
never
dared
touch
her
again
she
was
left
free
to
run
about
the
farm
and
one
day
she
disappeared
we
never
found
out
what
had
become
of
her
the
feast
of
john
was
drawing
near
and
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
my
arrival
on
the
farm
eugène
said
that
i
must
be
taken
to
the
village
in
honour
of
this
feast
day
the
farmer
wife
gave
me
a
yellow
dress
which
she
used
to
wear
when
she
was
a
girl
the
village
was
called
sainte
montague
it
only
had
one
street
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
church
martine
took
me
into
mass
which
had
already
begun
she
pushed
me
on
to
a
bench
and
she
sat
down
on
the
one
in
front
of
me
there
were
two
women
behind
me
who
never
stopped
talking
about
yesterday
market
and
the
men
near
the
door
talked
out
loud
without
seeming
to
mind
they
only
stopped
talking
when
the
priest
mounted
the
pulpit
i
thought
he
was
going
to
preach
but
he
only
gave
out
notices
of
the
weddings
every
time
he
mentioned
a
name
the
women
leaned
to
right
and
left
and
smiled
i
never
even
thought
of
praying
i
looked
at
martine
who
was
on
her
knees
her
dark
curls
had
got
out
from
under
her
embroidered
cap
her
shoulders
were
broad
and
her
white
bodice
was
fastened
at
the
waist
with
a
black
ribbon
the
whole
of
her
made
one
think
of
something
fresh
and
new
and
yet
the
mother
superior
had
told
me
that
shepherdesses
were
dirty
i
thought
of
martine
and
how
smart
she
always
looked
in
her
short
striped
petticoat
her
stockings
which
were
always
tightly
drawn
and
her
wooden
shoes
covered
with
leather
which
she
blacked
like
boots
she
was
always
very
careful
of
her
flock
and
the
farmer
wife
used
to
say
that
she
knew
every
one
of
her
sheep
when
we
came
out
of
mass
she
left
me
and
ran
up
to
an
old
woman
whom
she
kissed
tenderly
then
i
lost
sight
of
her
and
remained
all
by
myself
not
knowing
where
to
go
a
little
way
off
i
saw
the
inn
of
the
white
horse
there
was
a
noise
of
voices
there
and
i
could
hear
dishes
and
plates
rattling
people
went
in
in
crowds
and
presently
there
was
nobody
left
outside
i
was
going
back
into
the
church
to
wait
for
martine
to
come
and
fetch
me
when
i
saw
eugène
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
laughing
as
he
spoke
if
your
dress
had
not
been
as
yellow
as
it
is
i
should
certainly
have
forgotten
you
he
looked
at
me
as
though
he
were
making
fun
of
me
and
as
though
he
were
amused
at
something
he
took
me
to
the
schoolmaster
and
asked
him
to
give
me
luncheon
and
to
take
me
for
a
walk
with
the
children
the
schoolmaster
was
dressed
like
the
gentlemen
of
the
town
eugène
wore
a
blue
blouse
and
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
see
them
so
friendly
together
while
we
were
waiting
for
lunch
the
schoolmaster
lent
me
a
book
of
fairy
tales
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
walk
i
would
much
rather
have
been
left
alone
to
finish
the
book
on
the
village
green
the
boys
and
girls
were
dancing
in
the
sunshine
and
the
dust
i
thought
that
they
danced
too
roughly
and
that
they
were
too
noisy
i
felt
very
sad
and
when
the
cart
drove
us
back
to
the
farm
at
nightfall
i
felt
really
glad
to
be
back
in
the
silence
and
the
sweet
smell
of
the
meadows
again
a
few
days
after
that
on
our
way
home
from
the
forest
a
sheep
which
had
been
grazing
near
the
hedge
jumped
right
up
into
the
air
i
went
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
saw
that
his
nose
was
bleeding
i
thought
that
he
must
have
pricked
himself
with
a
big
thorn
and
after
having
washed
him
i
did
think
anything
more
about
it
next
day
i
was
terrified
to
see
that
his
head
had
swollen
up
till
it
was
almost
as
big
as
his
body
it
frightened
me
so
much
that
i
screamed
martine
came
running
up
and
she
began
screaming
too
and
everybody
came
i
explained
what
had
happened
the
day
before
and
the
farmer
said
that
the
sheep
must
have
been
bitten
by
a
viper
he
would
have
to
be
cared
for
and
must
be
left
in
the
stable
until
the
swelling
had
gone
down
i
asked
nothing
better
than
to
look
after
the
poor
brute
but
when
i
was
alone
with
it
i
felt
frightened
to
death
that
enormous
head
which
wobbled
on
the
little
body
made
me
half
crazy
with
terror
the
great
big
eyes
the
enormous
mouth
and
the
ears
which
stood
straight
up
made
a
monster
almost
impossible
to
imagine
the
poor
beast
always
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
stable
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
bumping
himself
against
the
wall
i
tried
to
go
to
him
telling
myself
that
it
was
only
a
sheep
after
all
but
i
could
not
but
directly
he
turned
towards
me
i
felt
dreadfully
sorry
for
him
sometimes
i
used
to
think
that
this
dreadful
face
which
wobbled
from
right
to
left
was
reproaching
me
then
something
seemed
to
wobble
inside
my
head
and
i
felt
as
though
i
were
going
mad
i
quite
understood
that
i
was
perfectly
capable
of
letting
him
die
of
hunger
i
told
the
cowherd
about
it
and
he
said
that
he
would
look
after
the
sheep
as
long
as
the
inflammation
lasted
he
laughed
at
me
a
little
and
said
he
could
not
understand
how
i
could
be
afraid
of
a
sick
sheep
i
was
able
to
do
him
a
good
turn
afterwards
and
i
was
very
glad
when
he
let
the
bull
out
one
morning
he
had
slipped
and
fallen
in
front
of
him
the
bull
had
sniffed
and
smelt
at
him
he
was
a
young
bull
which
had
been
brought
up
on
the
farm
and
was
a
little
bit
wild
the
cowherd
was
afraid
of
him
and
felt
quite
certain
that
he
would
remember
that
he
had
seen
him
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
i
should
have
liked
to
make
him
understand
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
but
i
did
know
what
to
say
to
prevent
his
being
frightened
i
was
quite
surprised
at
noticing
all
of
a
sudden
how
old
he
was
his
hat
had
dropped
on
to
the
ground
and
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
his
hair
was
quite
grey
i
thought
about
him
all
day
long
and
next
day
while
the
cows
were
going
out
one
by
one
i
went
into
the
stable
the
cowherd
was
looking
at
the
bull
who
was
pulling
at
the
chain
i
went
up
to
him
patted
him
and
let
him
loose
the
cowherd
stood
on
one
side
and
the
bull
rushed
out
as
if
he
were
mad
the
herd
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
limped
after
him
i
was
not
nearly
so
frightened
of
the
bull
as
i
had
been
of
the
sheep
with
the
swollen
face
and
i
used
to
go
into
the
stable
every
day
slipping
in
quietly
so
as
not
to
be
seen
but
eugène
had
seen
me
he
took
me
aside
one
morning
and
looking
right
into
my
eyes
with
his
little
eyes
he
said
why
did
you
let
the
bull
loose
i
was
afraid
the
would
be
scolded
if
i
told
the
truth
and
tried
to
find
something
to
say
to
him
i
began
to
say
that
i
did
let
him
loose
then
eugène
gave
a
little
chuckle
and
said
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
tell
lies
do
you
i
told
him
everything
and
they
sold
the
bull
next
saturday
i
had
often
noticed
how
kind
eugène
was
to
everybody
whenever
the
farmer
had
any
difficulties
with
his
men
he
always
used
to
call
his
brother
who
would
settle
everything
with
a
few
words
eugène
did
the
same
work
on
the
farm
as
master
silvain
did
but
he
always
refused
to
go
to
market
he
said
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
sell
even
a
cheese
he
walked
slowly
rocking
himself
a
little
as
he
walked
as
though
he
were
trying
to
keep
time
with
his
oxen
he
went
to
sainte
montagne
nearly
every
sunday
when
the
weather
was
bad
he
would
remain
in
the
at
the
farm
house
and
read
i
used
to
hope
that
he
would
leave
his
book
behind
him
one
day
but
he
never
forgot
it
and
always
took
it
to
his
room
with
him
one
of
my
great
troubles
was
that
i
could
not
find
anything
to
read
in
the
farm
and
i
used
to
pick
up
any
bits
of
printed
paper
that
i
saw
lying
about
the
farmer
wife
had
noticed
this
and
said
that
i
should
become
a
miser
some
day
one
sunday
when
i
had
screwed
up
my
courage
and
asked
eugène
for
a
book
he
gave
me
a
book
of
songs
all
through
the
summer
i
took
it
with
me
to
the
fields
i
made
up
tunes
for
the
songs
which
i
liked
best
then
i
got
tired
of
them
and
when
i
was
helping
pauline
to
clean
up
the
farm
for
all
saints
day
i
found
several
almanacks
pauline
told
me
to
take
them
up
to
the
garret
but
i
pretended
to
forget
and
carried
them
off
to
read
in
secret
one
after
the
other
they
were
full
of
amusing
stories
and
the
winter
went
by
without
my
ever
noticing
the
cold
when
i
took
them
up
to
the
garret
at
last
i
hunted
about
up
there
to
see
if
i
could
not
find
any
others
the
only
thing
i
found
was
a
little
book
without
any
cover
the
corners
of
the
leaves
were
rolled
up
as
if
it
had
been
carried
about
in
somebody
pocket
for
a
long
time
the
two
first
pages
were
missing
and
the
third
page
was
so
dirty
that
i
could
not
read
the
print
i
took
it
under
the
skylight
to
see
a
little
better
and
i
saw
that
it
was
called
the
adventures
of
telemachus
i
opened
it
here
and
there
and
the
few
words
that
i
read
interested
me
so
much
that
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
at
once
while
i
was
on
my
way
down
from
the
garret
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
eugène
might
have
put
the
book
there
and
that
he
might
come
and
look
for
it
at
any
time
so
i
put
it
back
on
the
black
rafter
where
i
had
found
it
every
time
i
could
manage
to
go
to
the
garret
i
looked
to
see
whether
it
was
still
in
its
place
and
i
read
it
as
much
and
as
often
as
ever
i
could
just
about
that
time
i
had
another
sick
sheep
its
flanks
were
hollow
as
though
it
had
not
eaten
for
a
long
while
i
went
and
asked
the
farmer
wife
what
i
ought
to
do
with
it
she
was
plucking
a
chicken
and
asked
me
whether
the
sheep
was
drawn
i
did
answer
at
once
i
did
quite
know
what
she
meant
then
i
thought
that
probably
whenever
a
sheep
was
ill
it
was
drawn
and
i
said
yes
and
so
as
to
make
it
quite
clear
i
added
it
is
quite
flat
pauline
began
to
laugh
at
me
she
called
eugène
and
said
eugène
one
of
marie
claire
sheep
is
drawn
and
flat
too
that
made
eugène
laugh
he
said
i
was
only
a
shepherdess
and
explained
to
me
that
sheep
were
drawn
when
their
stomachs
were
swollen
two
days
afterwards
pauline
told
me
that
she
and
master
silvain
saw
that
they
would
never
make
a
good
shepherdess
of
me
and
that
they
were
going
to
give
me
work
to
do
in
the
house
old
bibiche
was
not
good
for
much
and
pauline
could
not
do
everything
herself
because
of
her
baby
when
they
told
me
this
my
first
thought
was
that
i
should
be
able
to
go
up
to
the
garret
more
often
and
i
kissed
pauline
and
thanked
her
so
i
became
a
farm
servant
i
had
to
kill
the
chickens
and
the
rabbits
i
hated
doing
it
and
pauline
could
never
understand
why
she
said
i
was
like
eugène
who
ran
away
when
a
pig
was
being
killed
however
i
wanted
to
try
and
kill
a
chicken
so
as
to
show
that
i
did
my
best
i
took
it
into
the
granary
it
struggled
in
my
hands
and
the
straw
all
round
me
got
red
then
it
became
quite
still
and
i
put
it
down
for
bibiche
to
come
and
pluck
it
but
when
she
came
she
cackled
with
laughter
because
the
chicken
had
got
on
to
its
feet
again
and
was
in
the
middle
of
a
basket
of
corn
it
was
eating
greedily
as
though
it
wanted
to
get
well
as
quickly
as
possible
after
the
way
in
which
i
had
hurt
it
bibiche
got
hold
of
it
and
when
she
had
passed
the
blade
of
her
knife
across
its
neck
the
straw
was
much
redder
than
it
had
been
before
instead
of
going
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
day
i
used
to
go
up
to
the
garret
to
read
i
opened
the
book
anywhere
and
every
time
i
read
it
over
again
i
found
something
new
in
it
i
loved
this
book
of
mine
for
me
it
was
like
a
young
prisoner
whom
i
went
to
visit
secretly
i
used
to
imagine
that
it
was
dressed
like
a
page
and
that
it
waited
for
me
on
the
black
rafter
one
evening
i
went
on
a
lovely
journey
with
it
i
had
closed
the
book
and
was
leaning
on
my
elbows
and
looking
out
of
the
skylight
in
the
garret
it
was
almost
evening
and
the
pine
trees
looked
less
green
the
sun
was
pushing
its
way
into
the
white
clouds
which
hollowed
themselves
and
then
swelled
out
again
like
down
and
feathers
do
when
you
push
something
into
a
sackful
of
them
without
quite
knowing
how
i
found
myself
all
of
a
sudden
flying
over
a
wood
with
telemachus
he
held
me
by
the
hand
and
our
heads
touched
the
blue
of
the
sky
telemachus
said
nothing
but
i
knew
that
we
were
going
up
into
the
sun
old
bibiche
called
to
me
from
below
i
recognized
her
voice
although
it
was
so
far
off
she
must
be
very
angry
i
thought
to
be
calling
so
loud
i
did
care
i
saw
nothing
but
the
bright
flakes
of
white
down
which
surrounded
the
sun
and
which
were
opening
slowly
to
let
us
pass
in
a
tap
on
my
arm
brought
me
back
with
a
rush
into
the
garret
old
bibiche
was
pulling
me
away
from
the
skylight
and
saying
why
do
you
make
me
shout
like
that
i
have
called
you
at
least
twenty
times
to
come
and
get
your
supper
a
little
while
later
i
missed
the
book
from
the
rafter
but
it
had
become
a
friend
which
i
carried
about
in
my
heart
and
i
have
always
remembered
it
two
days
before
christmas
master
silvain
got
ready
to
kill
a
pig
he
sharpened
two
big
knives
and
after
having
made
a
litter
of
fresh
straw
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
he
sent
for
the
pig
which
made
such
a
noise
that
i
was
sure
he
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
master
silvain
roped
up
his
four
feet
and
while
he
fastened
them
to
pegs
which
he
had
hammered
into
the
ground
he
said
to
his
wife
hide
the
knives
pauline
do
let
him
see
them
pauline
gave
me
a
sort
of
deep
dish
which
i
was
to
hold
carefully
so
as
not
to
lose
a
single
drop
of
the
blood
which
i
was
to
catch
in
it
the
farmer
went
to
the
pig
which
had
fallen
on
its
side
he
went
down
on
one
knee
in
front
of
him
and
after
having
felt
his
neck
he
reached
his
hand
out
behind
his
back
to
his
wife
she
gave
him
the
bigger
of
the
two
knives
he
put
the
point
on
the
place
he
had
marked
with
his
finger
and
pressed
it
slowly
in
the
pig
cries
were
just
like
the
cries
of
a
baby
a
drop
of
blood
came
from
the
wound
and
rolled
slowly
down
in
a
long
red
line
then
two
spurts
ran
up
the
knife
and
fell
on
the
farmer
hand
when
the
blade
was
right
in
up
to
the
handle
master
silvain
put
his
weight
on
it
for
a
moment
and
drew
it
out
again
as
slowly
as
he
had
put
it
in
when
i
saw
the
blade
come
out
again
all
striped
with
red
i
felt
my
mouth
grow
cold
and
dry
my
fingers
went
limp
and
the
dish
toppled
over
to
one
side
master
silvain
saw
it
he
gave
me
one
look
and
said
to
his
wife
take
the
dish
away
from
her
i
could
not
say
a
word
but
i
shook
my
head
to
say
no
the
farmer
look
had
taken
my
nervousness
away
and
i
held
the
dish
quite
steadily
under
the
spurt
of
blood
which
came
out
from
the
pig
wound
when
the
pig
was
quite
still
eugène
came
up
he
looked
amazed
at
seeing
me
carefully
catching
the
last
red
drops
which
were
rolling
down
one
by
one
like
tears
do
you
mean
to
say
you
caught
the
blood
he
asked
yes
said
the
farmer
that
shows
that
she
is
not
a
chicken
heart
like
you
it
is
quite
true
said
eugène
to
me
i
hate
seeing
animals
killed
nonsense
said
master
silvain
animals
are
made
to
feed
us
just
as
wood
is
made
to
warm
us
eugène
turned
away
a
little
as
though
he
were
ashamed
of
his
weakness
his
shoulders
were
thin
and
his
neck
was
as
round
as
martine
master
silvain
used
to
say
that
he
was
the
living
portrait
of
their
mother
i
had
never
seen
eugène
angry
he
hummed
songs
all
day
long
in
the
evening
he
used
to
come
back
from
the
fields
sitting
sideways
on
one
of
the
oxen
and
he
nearly
always
sang
the
same
song
it
was
the
story
of
a
soldier
who
went
back
to
the
war
after
he
had
learned
that
the
girl
he
had
been
engaged
to
marry
had
married
another
man
he
used
to
dwell
on
the
refrain
which
finished
like
this
and
when
a
bullet
comes
and
takes
away
my
precious
life
you
know
i
died
because
you
were
another
fellow
wife
pauline
always
used
to
treat
eugène
with
much
respect
she
could
never
understand
my
freedom
with
him
the
first
evening
that
she
saw
me
sitting
next
to
him
on
the
bench
outside
the
door
she
made
signs
to
me
to
come
in
but
eugène
called
me
back
saying
come
and
listen
to
the
wood
owl
we
often
used
to
be
sitting
on
the
bench
still
when
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
the
wood
owl
came
quite
near
to
an
old
elm
tree
which
was
by
the
door
and
we
used
to
think
that
it
was
saying
good
night
to
us
then
it
would
fly
away
its
great
wings
passing
over
us
in
silence
sometimes
a
voice
would
sing
on
the
hillside
i
used
to
tremble
when
i
heard
it
the
full
voice
coming
out
of
the
night
reminded
me
of
colette
eugène
would
get
up
to
go
in
when
the
voice
stopped
singing
but
i
always
used
to
stop
hoping
to
hear
it
again
then
he
would
say
come
along
in
it
is
all
over
quand
par
un
tour
de
maladresse
un
boulet
allons
adieu
chère
maitresse
je
vais
dans
les
combats
and
now
that
the
winter
was
with
us
again
and
we
could
no
longer
sit
on
the
bench
by
the
door
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
secret
understanding
between
us
whenever
he
was
making
fun
of
anybody
his
queer
little
eyes
used
to
look
for
mine
and
whenever
he
gave
an
opinion
he
used
to
turn
to
me
as
though
he
expected
me
to
approve
or
disapprove
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
always
known
him
and
deep
down
in
my
thoughts
i
used
to
call
him
my
big
brother
he
was
always
asking
pauline
if
she
was
pleased
with
me
pauline
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
tell
him
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
the
only
thing
she
reproached
me
with
was
that
i
had
no
system
in
my
work
she
used
to
say
that
i
was
just
as
likely
to
begin
at
the
end
of
it
as
at
the
beginning
i
had
not
forgotten
sister
but
i
was
no
longer
as
sick
with
longing
for
her
as
i
used
to
be
and
i
was
happy
on
the
farm
in
the
month
of
june
the
men
came
as
they
came
every
year
to
shear
the
sheep
they
brought
bad
news
with
them
all
over
the
country
the
sheep
were
falling
ill
as
soon
as
they
had
been
shorn
and
numbers
of
them
were
dying
master
silvain
took
his
precautions
but
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
a
hundred
of
the
sheep
fell
sick
a
doctor
said
that
by
bathing
them
in
the
river
a
good
many
of
them
might
be
saved
so
the
farmer
got
into
the
water
up
to
his
middle
and
dipped
the
sheep
in
one
by
one
he
was
red
hot
and
the
perspiration
rolled
down
his
forehead
and
fell
in
great
drops
into
the
river
that
evening
when
he
went
to
bed
he
was
feverish
and
next
day
he
died
of
inflammation
of
the
lungs
pauline
could
not
believe
in
her
misfortune
and
eugène
wandered
about
the
stables
and
the
outhouses
with
frightened
eyes
soon
after
the
farmer
death
the
landlord
of
the
farm
came
to
see
us
he
was
a
little
dry
stick
of
a
man
who
never
kept
still
for
a
minute
and
if
he
did
stand
still
he
always
seemed
to
be
dancing
on
one
foot
his
face
was
and
his
name
was
tirande
he
came
into
the
where
i
was
sitting
with
pauline
he
walked
round
the
room
with
his
shoulders
hunched
up
then
he
said
pointing
to
the
baby
take
him
away
i
want
a
talk
with
the
goodwife
i
went
out
into
the
yard
and
managed
to
pass
the
window
as
often
as
i
could
pauline
had
not
moved
from
her
chair
her
hands
lay
on
her
knees
and
she
was
bending
her
head
forward
as
though
she
were
trying
to
understand
something
very
difficult
tirande
was
talking
without
looking
at
her
he
kept
walking
from
the
fireplace
to
the
door
and
back
again
and
the
noise
of
his
heels
on
the
tiled
floor
got
mixed
up
with
his
broken
little
voice
he
came
out
again
as
fast
as
he
had
come
in
and
i
went
and
asked
pauline
what
he
had
said
she
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
crying
as
she
told
me
she
said
that
tirande
was
going
to
take
the
farm
away
from
her
and
give
it
to
his
son
who
had
just
got
married
at
the
end
of
the
week
tirande
came
back
with
his
son
and
his
they
visited
the
outhouses
first
and
when
they
came
into
the
house
tirande
stopped
in
front
of
me
a
minute
and
told
me
that
his
had
made
up
her
mind
to
take
me
into
her
service
pauline
heard
him
say
so
and
made
a
step
towards
me
but
just
then
eugène
came
in
with
a
lot
of
papers
in
his
hand
and
everybody
sat
down
round
the
table
while
they
were
all
reading
the
papers
and
signing
i
looked
at
tirande
she
was
a
big
dark
woman
with
large
eyes
and
a
bored
look
she
left
the
farm
with
her
husband
without
having
glanced
at
me
once
when
their
cart
had
disappeared
down
the
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
pauline
told
eugène
what
tirande
had
said
to
me
eugène
who
was
leaving
the
room
turned
to
me
suddenly
he
looked
very
angry
and
his
voice
was
quite
changed
he
said
that
these
people
were
disposing
of
me
as
though
i
were
a
bit
of
furniture
which
belonged
to
them
while
pauline
was
pitying
me
eugène
told
me
that
it
was
tirande
who
had
told
master
silvain
to
take
me
on
the
farm
he
reminded
pauline
how
sorry
the
farmer
had
been
because
i
was
such
a
weakling
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
very
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
take
me
with
them
to
their
new
farm
we
were
all
three
standing
in
the
i
could
feel
sad
eyes
on
my
head
and
eugène
voice
made
me
think
of
a
hymn
pauline
was
to
leave
the
farm
at
the
end
of
the
summer
i
worked
hard
every
day
to
put
the
linen
in
order
i
did
want
pauline
to
take
away
a
single
piece
of
torn
linen
with
her
i
worked
hard
with
my
as
bonne
justine
had
taught
me
and
i
folded
every
piece
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
evening
i
found
eugène
sitting
on
the
bench
by
the
door
the
moon
was
shining
on
the
roofs
of
the
and
there
was
a
white
cloud
over
the
which
looked
like
a
tulle
veil
there
was
no
sound
whatever
from
the
all
that
we
heard
was
the
squeaking
of
the
cradle
which
pauline
was
rocking
to
put
her
child
to
sleep
as
soon
as
the
corn
had
been
got
in
eugène
began
getting
ready
to
go
the
cowherd
took
away
the
cattle
and
old
bibiche
went
off
in
the
cart
with
all
the
birds
of
the
in
a
few
days
nothing
was
left
at
the
farm
but
the
two
white
oxen
which
eugène
would
trust
to
nobody
but
himself
he
fastened
them
to
the
cart
which
was
to
take
pauline
and
her
child
the
little
fellow
was
fast
asleep
in
a
basket
full
of
straw
and
eugène
put
him
into
the
cart
without
waking
him
up
pauline
covered
him
with
her
shawl
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
towards
the
house
took
up
the
reins
and
the
cart
went
slowly
off
under
the
chestnut
trees
i
wanted
to
go
with
them
as
far
as
the
and
i
followed
the
cart
walking
behind
the
oxen
between
eugène
and
martine
none
of
us
spoke
every
now
and
then
eugène
gave
the
oxen
a
friendly
pat
we
were
quite
a
long
way
on
the
road
when
pauline
saw
that
the
sun
was
setting
she
stopped
the
horse
and
when
i
had
climbed
on
to
the
step
to
kiss
her
she
said
sadly
god
be
with
you
my
girl
behave
well
then
her
voice
filled
with
tears
and
she
added
if
my
poor
husband
were
living
he
would
never
have
given
you
up
martine
kissed
me
and
smiled
we
may
see
one
another
again
she
said
eugène
took
his
hat
off
he
held
my
hand
in
his
for
a
long
time
and
said
slowly
dear
little
friend
i
shall
always
remember
you
i
walked
a
little
way
back
and
turned
round
to
see
them
again
and
although
it
was
getting
dark
i
saw
that
eugène
and
martine
were
walking
hand
in
hand
part
iii
the
new
farmers
came
next
day
the
farm
hands
and
the
serving
women
had
come
early
in
the
morning
and
when
the
masters
arrived
in
the
evening
i
knew
that
they
were
called
monsieur
and
madame
alphonse
tirande
remained
at
villevieille
for
two
days
and
went
off
after
reminding
me
that
i
was
in
his
service
now
and
that
i
should
have
to
do
no
more
outside
work
on
the
farm
the
very
first
week
she
was
there
madame
alphonse
had
had
eugène
room
turned
into
a
and
she
had
set
me
to
work
at
a
big
table
on
which
were
a
number
of
pieces
of
linen
which
i
was
to
make
into
sheets
and
other
things
she
came
and
sat
down
next
to
me
and
worked
at
making
lace
she
would
remain
for
whole
days
at
a
time
without
saying
a
word
sometimes
she
talked
to
me
about
the
linen
presses
which
her
mother
had
full
of
all
kinds
of
linen
her
voice
had
no
ring
to
it
and
she
scarcely
moved
her
lips
when
she
spoke
tirande
seemed
very
fond
of
his
every
time
he
came
he
always
asked
her
what
she
would
like
him
to
give
her
she
cared
for
nothing
but
linen
and
he
went
off
saying
that
he
would
get
her
some
more
alphonse
never
appeared
at
all
except
at
meal
times
i
should
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
say
what
he
did
with
his
time
his
face
reminded
me
of
the
mother
superior
face
somehow
like
her
he
had
a
yellow
skin
and
his
eyes
glittered
he
looked
as
though
he
carried
a
brazier
inside
him
which
might
burn
him
up
at
any
minute
he
was
very
pious
and
every
sunday
he
and
madame
alphonse
went
to
mass
in
the
village
where
tirande
lived
at
first
they
wanted
to
take
me
in
their
cart
but
i
refused
i
preferred
going
to
sainte
montagne
where
i
always
hoped
to
meet
pauline
or
eugène
sometimes
one
of
the
farm
hands
came
with
me
but
more
often
i
would
go
alone
by
a
little
cross
road
which
made
the
way
much
shorter
it
was
a
steep
and
stony
bit
of
road
which
ran
uphill
through
the
broom
on
the
very
top
of
it
i
always
used
to
stop
in
front
of
jean
le
rouge
house
this
house
was
and
spreading
the
walls
were
as
black
as
the
thatch
which
covered
it
and
it
was
quite
easy
to
pass
by
the
house
without
seeing
it
at
all
for
the
broom
grew
so
high
all
round
it
i
used
to
go
in
for
a
chat
with
jean
le
rouge
whom
i
had
known
ever
since
i
had
been
at
villevieille
farm
he
had
always
worked
for
master
silvain
who
thought
very
highly
of
him
eugène
used
to
say
of
him
that
one
could
set
him
to
anything
and
that
whatever
he
did
he
did
well
now
alphonse
refused
to
employ
him
any
more
he
spoke
of
sending
him
away
from
the
house
on
the
hill
jean
le
rouge
was
so
upset
by
the
idea
that
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
directly
after
mass
i
used
to
go
home
by
the
same
road
children
would
crowd
round
me
to
get
the
blessed
bread
which
i
brought
out
of
church
for
them
there
were
six
of
them
and
the
eldest
was
not
yet
twelve
years
old
there
was
hardly
one
mouthful
of
my
blessed
bread
so
i
used
to
give
it
to
jean
wife
to
divide
up
and
give
to
the
children
in
equal
shares
while
she
was
doing
this
jean
le
rouge
would
set
a
stool
for
me
in
front
of
the
fire
and
would
seat
himself
on
a
log
of
wood
which
he
would
roll
to
the
fireplace
with
his
foot
his
wife
put
some
twigs
on
the
fire
with
a
pair
of
heavy
pincers
and
as
we
sat
and
talked
we
watched
the
big
yellow
potatoes
cooking
in
the
pot
which
hung
from
a
hook
in
the
fireplace
on
the
very
first
sunday
jean
le
rouge
had
told
me
that
he
too
was
a
foundling
and
little
by
little
he
had
told
me
that
when
he
was
twelve
he
had
been
put
to
work
with
a
woodcutter
who
used
to
live
in
the
house
on
the
hill
he
had
very
soon
learned
how
to
climb
up
the
trees
to
fasten
a
rope
to
the
top
branches
so
as
to
pull
them
over
when
the
day
work
was
done
and
he
had
his
faggot
of
wood
on
his
back
he
would
go
on
ahead
so
as
to
get
to
the
house
first
and
there
he
used
to
find
the
woodcutter
little
daughter
cooking
the
soup
for
supper
she
was
of
the
same
age
as
he
was
and
they
had
become
the
best
of
friends
at
once
then
one
christmas
eve
came
the
misfortune
the
old
woodcutter
who
thought
that
the
children
were
fast
asleep
went
off
to
midnight
mass
but
directly
he
had
gone
they
got
up
they
wanted
to
prepare
midnight
supper
for
the
old
man
return
and
they
danced
with
glee
at
the
surprise
they
were
getting
ready
for
him
while
the
little
girl
was
cooking
the
chestnuts
and
putting
the
pot
of
honey
and
the
jug
of
cider
on
the
table
jean
le
rouge
heaped
great
logs
on
to
the
fire
time
went
on
the
chestnuts
were
cooked
and
the
woodcutter
had
not
yet
come
home
it
seemed
a
long
time
the
children
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fire
to
keep
themselves
warm
leaned
up
against
one
another
and
fell
asleep
jean
woke
up
at
the
little
girl
screams
he
could
not
understand
at
first
why
she
was
throwing
her
arms
about
and
shrieking
at
the
fire
he
jumped
to
his
feet
to
run
away
from
her
and
then
he
saw
that
she
was
ablaze
she
had
opened
the
door
to
the
garden
and
as
she
ran
out
she
lit
the
trees
up
then
jean
had
caught
hold
of
her
and
thrown
her
into
the
little
well
the
water
had
put
the
flames
out
but
when
jean
tried
to
pull
her
out
of
the
well
he
found
her
so
heavy
that
he
thought
she
must
be
dead
she
made
no
movement
and
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
get
her
out
at
last
when
he
did
get
her
out
he
had
to
drag
her
along
like
a
bundle
of
sticks
back
to
the
house
the
logs
had
become
great
red
embers
only
the
biggest
one
which
was
wet
went
on
smoking
and
crackling
the
little
girl
face
was
all
bloated
and
was
black
with
violet
veins
in
it
her
body
which
was
half
naked
was
covered
with
big
red
burns
she
was
ill
for
many
months
and
when
at
last
they
thought
she
was
cured
they
found
out
that
she
had
become
dumb
she
could
hear
perfectly
well
she
could
even
laugh
like
everybody
else
but
it
was
quite
impossible
for
her
to
speak
a
single
word
while
jean
le
rouge
was
telling
me
these
things
his
wife
used
to
look
at
him
and
move
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
reading
a
book
her
face
still
bore
deep
burn
marks
but
one
soon
got
accustomed
to
it
and
remembered
nothing
of
her
face
but
the
mouth
with
its
white
teeth
and
her
eyes
which
were
never
still
she
used
to
call
her
children
with
a
long
low
cry
and
they
came
running
up
and
always
understood
all
the
signs
she
made
to
them
i
was
so
sorry
that
they
had
to
leave
the
house
on
the
hill
they
were
the
last
friends
i
had
left
and
i
thought
of
telling
madame
alphonse
about
them
hoping
that
she
might
get
her
husband
to
keep
them
on
i
found
an
opportunity
one
day
when
tirande
and
his
son
had
come
into
the
talking
about
the
changes
they
were
going
to
make
at
the
farm
alphonse
said
he
did
want
any
cattle
he
spoke
of
buying
machinery
cutting
down
the
pine
trees
and
clearing
the
hillside
the
stables
would
do
for
sheds
for
the
machines
and
he
would
use
the
house
on
the
hill
to
store
fodder
in
i
do
know
whether
madame
alphonse
was
listening
she
went
on
making
lace
and
seemed
to
be
giving
her
full
attention
to
it
as
soon
as
the
two
men
had
gone
i
plucked
up
courage
to
talk
of
jean
le
rouge
i
told
her
how
useful
he
had
been
to
master
silvain
i
told
her
how
sorry
he
was
to
leave
the
house
in
which
he
had
lived
for
so
long
and
when
i
stopped
trembling
for
the
answer
which
was
coming
madame
alphonse
took
her
needles
out
of
the
thread
i
believe
i
have
made
a
mistake
she
said
she
counted
up
to
nineteen
and
said
again
what
a
nuisance
it
is
i
shall
have
to
undo
a
whole
row
when
i
told
jean
le
rouge
about
this
he
was
angry
and
shook
his
fist
at
villevieille
his
wife
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
at
him
and
he
was
quiet
at
once
jean
le
rouge
left
the
house
on
the
hill
at
the
end
of
january
and
i
was
very
sad
i
had
no
friends
left
now
i
hardly
recognized
the
farm
any
more
all
these
new
people
had
made
themselves
quite
at
home
there
and
i
seemed
to
myself
to
be
a
the
looked
at
me
with
distrust
and
the
ploughman
avoided
talking
to
me
the
servant
name
was
adèle
all
day
long
you
could
hear
her
grumbling
and
dragging
her
wooden
shoes
after
her
as
she
walked
she
made
a
noise
even
when
she
was
walking
on
straw
she
used
to
eat
her
meals
standing
and
answer
her
master
and
mistress
quite
rudely
alphonse
had
taken
away
the
bench
which
was
by
the
door
and
had
put
up
little
green
bushes
with
round
them
he
cut
down
the
old
elm
tree
too
to
which
the
wood
owl
used
to
come
on
summer
evenings
of
course
the
old
tree
had
not
shaded
the
house
for
a
long
time
it
only
had
one
tuft
of
leaves
right
up
on
the
top
it
looked
like
a
head
which
bent
over
to
listen
to
what
people
underneath
were
saying
the
woodcutters
who
came
to
cut
it
down
said
that
it
would
not
be
an
easy
thing
to
do
they
said
there
was
some
danger
that
when
it
fell
it
would
crash
through
the
roof
of
the
house
at
last
after
a
lot
of
talk
they
decided
to
rope
it
round
and
pull
it
over
so
that
it
fell
on
to
the
it
took
two
men
all
day
to
cut
it
down
and
just
when
we
thought
that
it
was
going
to
drop
nicely
one
of
the
ropes
worked
loose
and
the
old
elm
jumped
and
fell
to
one
side
it
slipped
down
the
roof
knocking
down
a
chimney
and
a
large
number
of
tiles
bumped
a
piece
out
of
the
wall
and
fell
right
across
the
door
not
one
of
its
branches
touched
the
alphonse
yelled
with
rage
he
laid
hold
of
the
axe
belonging
to
one
of
the
woodcutters
and
struck
the
tree
so
violent
a
blow
that
a
piece
of
bark
flew
against
the
window
and
broke
a
pane
madame
alphonse
saw
the
bits
of
glass
fall
on
me
she
jumped
up
in
more
excitement
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
show
and
with
trembling
hands
and
fearful
eyes
she
examined
closely
every
bit
of
the
which
i
was
embroidering
but
she
did
not
see
me
wiping
away
the
blood
from
my
cheek
which
had
been
cut
by
a
bit
of
glass
she
was
so
afraid
that
something
might
happen
to
the
piles
of
linen
which
were
beginning
to
grow
that
she
took
me
off
next
day
to
her
mother
to
show
me
how
the
linen
should
be
put
into
the
closets
madame
alphonse
mother
was
called
madame
deslois
but
when
the
ploughmen
talked
about
her
they
always
said
the
good
woman
of
the
castle
she
had
only
been
to
villevieille
once
she
had
come
close
up
to
me
and
looked
at
me
with
her
eyes
half
shut
she
was
a
big
woman
who
walked
bent
double
as
if
she
were
looking
for
something
on
the
ground
she
lived
in
a
big
house
called
the
lost
ford
madame
alphonse
took
me
along
by
a
path
near
a
little
river
it
was
the
end
of
march
and
the
meadows
were
already
in
flower
madame
alphonse
walked
straight
along
the
path
but
i
got
a
lot
of
pleasure
out
of
walking
in
the
soft
grass
we
soon
came
to
the
wood
where
the
wolf
had
taken
my
lamb
i
had
always
had
a
mysterious
fear
of
this
wood
and
when
we
left
the
path
by
the
river
to
go
through
it
i
shook
with
fear
and
yet
the
road
was
a
broad
one
it
must
even
have
been
a
carriage
road
for
there
were
deep
ruts
in
it
above
our
heads
heaps
of
pine
needles
tickled
one
another
and
rustled
they
made
a
gentle
noise
not
a
bit
like
the
whispering
with
silences
in
between
which
i
used
to
hear
in
the
forest
when
the
snow
was
on
it
but
in
spite
of
all
i
could
not
help
looking
behind
me
we
did
walk
very
far
through
the
wood
the
road
turned
to
the
left
and
we
got
to
the
courtyard
of
the
lost
ford
immediately
the
little
river
ran
behind
the
stables
as
it
did
at
villevieille
but
here
the
meadows
were
quite
close
together
and
the
buildings
looked
as
though
they
were
trying
to
hide
among
the
sapling
pines
the
living
house
did
look
anything
like
the
farms
thereabouts
the
ground
floor
was
built
of
very
thick
old
walls
and
the
first
floor
looked
as
though
it
had
been
put
on
top
of
them
as
a
makeshift
the
house
did
not
look
a
bit
like
a
castle
to
me
it
made
me
think
of
an
old
tree
trunk
out
of
which
a
baby
tree
had
sprouted
and
sprouted
badly
madame
deslois
came
to
the
door
when
she
heard
us
arrive
she
winked
her
little
eyes
as
she
looked
at
me
and
said
at
once
in
a
loud
voice
that
she
had
dropped
a
halfpenny
in
the
straw
and
that
it
was
very
funny
that
nobody
had
found
it
as
it
had
been
lost
for
a
week
while
she
spoke
she
moved
her
foot
about
and
stirred
the
straw
which
was
in
front
of
the
door
madame
alphonse
can
not
have
heard
her
her
big
eyes
were
staring
into
the
house
and
she
was
almost
excited
when
she
said
why
we
had
come
madame
deslois
said
that
she
would
take
me
to
the
herself
she
put
the
keys
into
the
locks
of
the
cupboards
and
after
having
told
me
to
be
very
careful
and
to
disarrange
nothing
she
left
me
alone
it
did
take
me
long
to
open
and
close
the
great
shining
cupboards
i
should
have
liked
to
go
away
at
once
this
big
cold
frightened
me
like
a
prison
my
feet
sounded
on
the
tiles
as
though
there
were
deep
vaults
underneath
them
all
of
a
sudden
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
should
never
get
out
of
this
again
i
listened
to
see
whether
i
could
hear
any
animals
stirring
but
i
only
heard
madame
deslois
voice
it
was
a
rough
strong
voice
which
went
right
through
the
walls
and
could
be
heard
everywhere
i
was
going
to
the
window
so
as
to
feel
a
little
less
lonely
when
a
door
which
i
had
not
noticed
suddenly
opened
behind
me
i
turned
round
and
saw
a
young
man
come
in
he
wore
a
long
white
smock
and
a
grey
cap
he
stood
standing
as
though
he
were
surprised
to
see
anybody
there
and
i
went
on
looking
at
him
without
being
able
to
take
my
eyes
away
he
walked
right
across
the
and
he
and
i
stared
and
stared
at
one
another
then
he
went
out
banging
himself
against
the
woodwork
of
the
door
a
moment
afterwards
he
passed
by
the
window
and
our
eyes
met
again
i
felt
quite
uncomfortable
and
without
knowing
why
i
went
and
shut
the
doors
which
he
had
left
open
presently
madame
alphonse
came
and
fetched
me
and
i
went
back
to
villevieille
with
her
since
alphonse
had
taken
pauline
place
i
had
got
into
the
habit
of
going
and
sitting
in
a
bush
which
had
grown
into
the
shape
of
a
chair
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
shrubbery
not
far
from
the
farm
now
that
spring
was
beginning
i
used
to
go
and
sit
there
when
the
ploughmen
were
smoking
their
pipes
at
the
stable
doors
i
used
to
sit
there
listening
to
the
little
noises
of
the
evening
and
i
longed
to
be
like
the
trees
that
evening
i
thought
of
the
man
i
had
seen
at
lost
ford
but
every
time
i
tried
to
remember
the
exact
colour
of
his
eyes
they
pierced
into
my
own
eyes
so
that
they
seemed
to
be
lighting
me
all
up
inside
the
next
sunday
was
easter
sunday
adèle
had
gone
to
mass
in
alphonse
cart
i
remained
alone
with
one
of
the
ploughmen
to
look
after
the
farm
after
luncheon
the
ploughman
went
to
sleep
on
a
heap
of
straw
in
front
of
the
door
and
i
went
to
my
shrubbery
to
spend
the
afternoon
i
tried
to
hear
the
bells
ringing
but
the
farm
was
too
far
from
the
villages
round
and
i
could
hear
none
of
them
i
began
to
think
about
sister
and
my
thoughts
went
back
to
sophie
who
used
to
come
and
wake
me
up
every
year
so
that
i
should
hear
all
the
bells
ringing
in
easter
together
one
year
she
wake
up
she
was
so
upset
at
that
that
next
year
she
put
a
big
stone
in
her
mouth
to
keep
herself
from
sleeping
every
time
she
nodded
off
her
teeth
met
on
the
stone
and
she
woke
up
i
sat
and
thought
about
high
mass
where
colette
used
to
sing
in
her
beautiful
voice
and
i
could
see
our
afternoon
on
the
lawn
and
sister
busy
with
the
special
dinner
which
they
gave
us
on
feast
days
and
that
evening
when
came
i
should
see
instead
of
sister
sweet
loving
face
madame
alphonse
hard
face
and
her
husband
glittering
eyes
which
frightened
me
so
and
as
i
sat
and
thought
how
long
i
should
still
have
to
stay
on
the
farm
i
felt
deeply
discouraged
when
i
was
tired
of
crying
i
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
sun
was
quite
low
through
the
branches
of
my
shrubbery
i
watched
the
long
thin
shadows
of
the
poplar
trees
growing
longer
than
ever
on
the
grass
and
quite
close
to
me
i
saw
a
long
shadow
which
was
moving
it
came
forward
then
stopped
and
then
came
forward
again
i
understood
at
once
that
somebody
was
going
to
pass
my
and
almost
immediately
the
man
in
the
white
smock
walked
into
the
shrubbery
stooping
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
branches
i
felt
cold
all
over
i
soon
got
control
of
myself
but
i
could
not
help
trembling
nervously
he
remained
standing
in
front
of
me
without
saying
a
word
i
sat
and
looked
at
his
eyes
which
were
very
gentle
and
i
began
to
feel
warm
again
i
noticed
that
as
eugène
used
to
he
wore
a
coloured
shirt
and
a
cravat
tied
under
the
collar
and
when
he
spoke
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
known
his
voice
for
a
long
time
he
leaned
against
a
big
branch
opposite
me
and
asked
me
if
i
had
no
relations
i
said
no
his
eye
ran
along
the
branch
covered
with
young
shoots
and
without
looking
at
me
he
said
again
then
you
are
all
alone
in
the
world
i
answered
quickly
oh
no
i
have
sister
and
without
leaving
him
time
to
ask
any
more
questions
i
told
him
how
i
had
longed
for
her
and
how
impatiently
i
was
waiting
and
hoping
to
see
her
again
talking
about
her
made
me
so
happy
that
i
could
not
stop
talking
i
told
him
of
her
beauty
and
of
her
intelligence
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
above
everything
in
the
world
i
told
him
too
how
sorry
she
had
been
when
i
went
away
and
of
the
joy
that
i
knew
she
would
feel
when
she
saw
me
come
back
while
i
talked
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
my
face
but
they
seemed
to
look
much
further
after
a
silence
he
asked
again
have
you
no
friends
here
no
i
said
all
those
whom
i
loved
have
gone
and
i
added
rather
angrily
they
have
even
turned
out
jean
le
rouge
and
yet
he
said
madame
alphonse
is
not
unkind
i
told
him
that
she
was
neither
unkind
nor
kind
and
that
i
should
leave
her
without
any
regret
then
we
heard
the
sound
of
alphonse
and
i
got
up
to
go
he
stood
aside
a
little
to
let
me
pass
him
and
i
left
him
alone
in
the
shrubbery
that
evening
i
took
advantage
of
the
unusually
good
humour
of
adèle
to
ask
her
if
she
knew
any
of
the
ploughmen
at
the
lost
ford
she
said
she
only
knew
some
of
the
old
ones
for
since
madame
deslois
had
been
a
widow
the
new
ones
never
stayed
with
her
a
sort
of
fear
which
i
could
not
have
explained
kept
me
from
mentioning
the
young
man
in
the
white
smock
and
adèle
added
with
a
wag
of
her
chin
fortunately
her
eldest
son
has
come
back
from
paris
the
farm
hands
will
be
happier
next
day
while
madame
alphonse
was
working
at
her
lace
i
sewed
and
thought
about
the
ploughman
in
the
white
smock
i
could
not
in
my
mind
help
comparing
him
to
eugène
he
spoke
like
eugène
did
and
they
seemed
like
one
another
somehow
that
evening
i
thought
i
saw
him
near
the
stables
and
a
moment
later
he
came
into
the
his
eyes
just
glanced
at
me
and
then
he
looked
straight
at
madame
alphonse
he
held
his
head
high
and
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
drooped
a
little
madame
alphonse
said
in
a
happy
voice
when
she
saw
him
why
there
henri
and
she
let
him
kiss
her
on
both
cheeks
and
told
him
to
bring
a
chair
up
next
to
her
but
he
sat
sideways
on
the
table
pushing
the
linen
to
one
side
adèle
came
into
the
room
and
madame
alphonse
said
if
you
see
my
husband
tell
him
that
my
brother
is
here
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
understood
then
i
realized
suddenly
that
the
young
man
in
the
white
smock
was
madame
deslois
eldest
son
a
sense
of
shame
which
i
had
never
felt
before
made
me
blush
fiercely
and
i
was
ever
so
sorry
that
i
had
spoken
about
sister
i
felt
that
i
had
thrown
the
thing
that
i
loved
best
to
the
winds
and
do
what
i
could
i
could
not
keep
back
two
big
tears
which
tickled
the
corners
of
my
mouth
and
then
fell
on
the
linen
napkin
i
was
hemming
henri
deslois
remained
sitting
on
the
corner
of
the
table
for
a
long
time
i
could
feel
that
he
was
looking
at
me
and
his
eyes
were
like
a
heavy
weight
which
prevented
me
from
lifting
up
my
head
two
days
afterwards
i
found
him
in
the
shrubbery
when
i
saw
him
sitting
there
my
legs
felt
weak
under
me
and
i
stood
still
he
got
up
at
once
so
that
i
should
sit
down
but
i
remained
standing
and
looking
at
him
he
had
the
same
gentleness
in
his
eyes
that
i
had
noticed
the
first
time
and
as
if
he
expected
me
to
tell
him
another
story
have
you
nothing
to
tell
me
this
evening
he
asked
words
danced
across
my
brain
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
worth
speaking
and
i
shook
my
head
to
say
no
he
said
i
was
your
friend
the
other
day
recollection
of
what
i
had
said
the
other
day
made
me
feel
worse
than
ever
and
i
only
said
you
are
madame
alphonse
brother
i
left
him
and
did
not
dare
to
go
back
to
the
shrubbery
again
he
often
came
back
to
villevieille
i
never
used
to
look
at
him
but
his
voice
always
made
me
feel
very
uncomfortable
since
jean
le
rouge
had
gone
i
had
never
known
what
to
do
with
my
time
after
mass
every
sunday
i
used
to
pass
the
house
on
the
hill
sometimes
i
would
look
in
through
the
gaps
in
the
shutters
and
when
as
i
sometimes
did
i
bumped
my
head
the
noise
it
made
used
to
frighten
me
one
sunday
i
noticed
that
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
i
put
my
finger
on
the
latch
and
the
door
fell
open
with
a
loud
noise
i
had
not
expected
it
to
open
so
quickly
and
i
stood
there
longing
to
shut
it
and
go
away
then
as
there
was
no
more
noise
and
as
the
sun
had
streamed
into
the
house
making
a
big
square
of
light
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
in
and
went
in
leaving
the
door
open
the
big
fireplace
was
empty
there
was
no
hook
there
was
no
pot
and
the
big
andirons
had
gone
the
only
things
left
in
the
room
were
the
logs
of
wood
which
jean
le
rouge
children
used
to
use
as
stools
the
bark
was
worn
off
them
and
the
tops
of
them
were
polished
as
if
with
wax
from
the
children
sitting
on
them
the
second
room
was
quite
empty
there
were
no
tiles
on
the
floor
and
the
feet
of
the
beds
had
made
little
holes
in
the
beaten
earth
there
was
no
lock
to
the
other
door
either
and
i
went
out
into
the
garden
there
were
a
few
winter
vegetables
in
the
beds
still
and
the
fruit
trees
were
all
in
flower
most
of
them
were
very
old
some
of
them
looked
like
hunchbacks
and
their
branches
bent
towards
the
ground
as
though
they
found
that
even
the
flowers
were
too
heavy
for
them
to
carry
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
the
hill
ran
down
to
an
immense
plain
where
the
cattle
used
to
graze
and
right
at
the
end
a
row
of
poplars
made
a
sort
of
barrier
which
kept
the
sky
out
of
the
meadow
land
little
by
little
i
recognized
one
place
after
another
there
was
a
little
river
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
i
could
not
see
the
water
but
the
willows
looked
as
though
they
were
standing
on
one
side
to
let
it
pass
the
river
disappeared
behind
the
buildings
of
villevieille
farm
there
the
roofs
were
of
the
same
colour
as
the
chestnut
trees
and
the
river
went
on
on
the
other
side
of
them
here
and
there
i
could
see
it
shining
between
the
poplar
trees
then
it
plunged
into
the
great
pine
wood
which
looked
quite
black
in
which
the
lost
ford
was
hidden
that
was
the
road
i
had
taken
with
madame
alphonse
when
we
went
to
her
mother
house
her
brother
must
have
come
that
way
that
day
when
he
found
me
in
the
shrubbery
there
was
nobody
on
the
road
today
everything
was
tender
green
and
i
could
see
no
white
smock
among
the
clumps
of
trees
i
tried
to
see
the
shrubbery
but
the
farm
hid
it
henri
deslois
had
been
in
the
shrubbery
several
times
since
easter
i
could
not
have
told
how
i
knew
that
he
was
there
but
on
those
days
i
could
never
prevent
myself
from
walking
round
that
way
yesterday
henri
deslois
had
come
into
the
while
i
was
there
alone
he
had
opened
his
mouth
as
though
he
were
going
to
talk
to
me
i
had
looked
at
him
as
i
had
done
the
first
time
and
he
went
away
without
saying
anything
and
now
that
i
was
in
the
open
garden
surrounded
by
broom
in
flower
i
longed
to
be
able
to
live
there
always
there
was
a
big
apple
tree
leaning
over
me
dipping
the
end
of
its
branches
in
the
spring
the
spring
came
out
of
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
and
the
overflow
trickled
in
little
brooks
over
the
beds
this
garden
of
flowers
and
clear
water
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
beautiful
garden
in
the
world
and
when
i
turned
my
head
towards
the
house
which
stood
open
to
the
sunshine
i
seemed
to
expect
extraordinary
people
to
come
out
of
it
the
house
seemed
full
of
mystery
to
me
queer
little
sounds
came
out
of
it
and
a
few
moments
ago
i
thought
that
i
had
heard
the
same
sound
that
henri
deslois
feet
made
when
he
stepped
into
the
at
villevieille
i
had
been
listening
as
though
i
expected
to
see
him
coming
but
i
had
not
heard
his
footstep
again
and
presently
i
noticed
that
the
broom
and
the
trees
were
making
all
kinds
of
mysterious
sounds
i
began
to
imagine
that
i
was
a
little
tree
and
that
the
wind
stirred
me
as
it
liked
the
same
fresh
breeze
which
made
the
broom
rock
passed
over
my
head
and
tangled
my
hair
and
so
as
to
do
like
the
other
trees
did
i
stooped
down
and
dipped
my
fingers
in
the
clear
waters
of
the
spring
another
sound
made
me
look
at
the
house
again
and
i
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
i
saw
henri
deslois
standing
framed
in
the
doorway
his
head
was
bare
and
his
arms
were
swinging
he
stepped
out
into
the
garden
and
looked
far
off
into
the
plain
his
hair
was
parted
on
the
side
and
was
a
little
thin
at
the
temples
he
remained
perfectly
still
for
a
long
minute
then
he
turned
to
me
there
were
only
two
trees
between
us
he
took
a
step
forward
took
hold
of
the
young
tree
in
front
of
him
with
one
hand
and
the
branches
in
flower
made
a
bouquet
over
his
head
it
grew
so
light
that
i
thought
the
bark
of
the
trees
was
glittering
and
every
flower
was
shining
and
in
henri
deslois
eyes
there
was
so
deep
a
gentleness
that
i
went
to
him
without
any
shame
he
did
move
when
i
stopped
in
front
of
him
his
face
became
whiter
than
his
smock
and
his
lips
quivered
he
took
my
two
hands
and
pressed
them
hard
against
his
temples
then
he
said
very
low
i
am
like
a
miser
who
has
found
his
treasure
again
at
that
moment
the
bell
of
sainte
montagne
church
began
to
ring
the
sound
of
the
bell
ran
up
the
hillsides
and
after
resting
over
our
heads
for
a
moment
ran
on
and
died
away
in
the
distance
the
hours
passed
the
day
grew
older
and
the
cattle
disappeared
from
the
plain
a
white
mist
rose
from
the
little
river
then
a
stone
slipped
behind
the
barrier
of
poplar
trees
and
the
broom
flowers
began
to
grow
darker
henri
deslois
went
back
towards
the
farm
with
me
he
walked
in
front
of
me
on
the
narrow
path
and
when
he
left
me
just
before
we
came
to
the
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
i
knew
that
i
loved
him
even
more
than
sister
the
house
on
the
hill
became
our
house
every
sunday
i
found
henri
deslois
waiting
there
and
as
i
used
to
do
when
jean
le
rouge
lived
there
i
took
my
blessed
bread
to
the
house
on
the
hill
after
mass
and
we
used
to
laugh
as
we
divided
it
we
both
had
the
same
kind
of
feeling
of
liberty
which
made
us
run
races
round
the
garden
and
wet
our
shoes
in
the
brooklets
from
the
spring
henri
deslois
used
to
say
on
sundays
i
too
am
seventeen
years
old
sometimes
we
would
go
for
long
walks
in
the
woods
which
skirted
the
hill
henri
deslois
was
never
tired
of
hearing
me
talk
about
my
childhood
and
sister
sometimes
we
talked
about
eugène
whom
he
knew
he
used
to
say
that
he
was
one
of
those
men
whom
one
liked
to
have
for
a
friend
i
told
him
what
a
bad
shepherdess
i
had
been
and
although
i
felt
sure
he
would
laugh
at
me
i
told
him
the
story
of
the
sheep
which
was
all
swollen
up
he
did
laugh
he
put
a
finger
on
my
forehead
and
said
love
is
the
only
thing
that
will
cure
that
one
day
we
stopped
near
an
immense
field
of
corn
it
was
so
big
that
we
could
not
see
the
end
of
it
thousands
of
white
butterflies
were
floating
about
over
the
corn
ears
henri
deslois
did
speak
and
i
watched
the
ears
of
corn
which
were
stooping
and
stretching
as
though
they
were
getting
ready
to
fly
it
looked
as
though
the
butterflies
were
bringing
them
wings
to
help
them
but
it
was
no
good
for
the
corn
ears
to
get
excited
they
could
not
get
away
from
the
ground
i
told
my
idea
to
henri
deslois
who
looked
at
the
corn
for
a
long
time
and
then
as
though
he
were
speaking
to
himself
and
dragging
the
words
out
he
said
it
is
much
the
same
kind
of
thing
with
a
man
sometimes
a
woman
comes
to
him
she
looks
like
the
white
butterflies
of
the
plain
he
does
know
whether
she
comes
up
from
the
earth
or
whether
she
comes
down
from
the
sky
he
feels
that
with
her
he
could
live
on
the
wind
which
passes
and
the
fresh
young
flowers
but
like
the
root
which
holds
the
corn
to
earth
a
mysterious
bond
holds
him
to
his
duty
which
is
as
strong
as
the
earth
i
thought
that
his
voice
had
an
accent
of
suffering
and
that
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooped
more
than
usual
but
almost
immediately
his
eyes
looked
into
mine
and
he
said
in
a
stronger
voice
we
must
have
confidence
in
ourselves
summer
passed
and
the
autumn
and
in
spite
of
the
bad
weather
of
december
we
could
not
make
up
our
minds
to
leave
the
house
on
the
hill
henri
deslois
used
to
bring
books
with
him
which
we
would
read
sitting
on
the
logs
of
wood
in
the
back
room
which
looked
into
the
garden
i
went
back
to
the
farm
at
nightfall
and
adèle
who
thought
i
was
spending
my
time
dancing
in
the
village
was
always
surprised
that
i
looked
so
sad
almost
every
day
henri
deslois
came
to
villevieille
i
could
hear
him
from
a
long
way
off
he
rode
a
great
white
mare
which
trotted
heavily
and
he
rode
her
without
saddle
or
bridle
she
was
a
patient
and
a
gentle
brute
her
master
used
to
let
her
run
loose
in
the
yard
while
he
went
in
to
say
good
day
to
madame
alphonse
as
soon
as
alphonse
heard
him
he
would
come
into
the
the
two
of
them
would
speak
of
improvements
on
the
farm
or
about
people
whom
they
knew
but
there
was
always
a
word
or
a
sentence
in
their
conversation
which
came
straight
to
me
from
henri
deslois
i
often
used
to
catch
alphonse
looking
at
me
and
i
could
not
always
keep
from
blushing
one
afternoon
as
henri
deslois
came
in
to
the
room
smiling
alphonse
said
you
know
i
have
sold
the
house
on
the
hill
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
they
both
grew
so
pale
that
i
was
afraid
they
were
going
to
die
where
they
stood
then
alphonse
got
out
of
his
chair
and
stood
leaning
against
the
while
henri
deslois
went
to
the
door
and
tried
to
close
it
madame
alphonse
put
her
lace
down
on
her
knee
and
said
as
though
she
were
repeating
a
lesson
the
house
was
of
no
particular
good
and
i
am
very
pleased
that
it
has
been
sold
henri
deslois
came
and
stood
by
the
table
so
close
to
me
that
he
could
have
touched
me
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
firm
i
am
sorry
you
have
sold
it
without
having
mentioned
it
to
me
for
i
intended
to
buy
it
alphonse
wriggled
like
an
earthworm
he
made
a
great
effort
to
laugh
out
loud
and
as
he
laughed
he
said
you
would
have
bought
it
what
would
you
have
done
with
it
henri
deslois
put
his
hand
on
the
back
of
my
chair
and
answered
i
would
have
lived
in
it
as
jean
le
rouge
did
alphonse
walked
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
chimney
his
face
had
changed
into
a
yellow
earthy
colour
his
hands
were
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
he
picked
up
his
feet
so
quickly
that
it
looked
as
though
he
were
pulling
at
them
with
a
cord
which
he
held
in
each
hand
then
he
came
and
leaned
on
the
table
opposite
us
and
looking
at
us
one
after
the
other
with
his
glittering
eyes
he
bent
forward
and
said
well
i
have
sold
it
now
so
it
is
all
over
during
the
silence
which
followed
we
could
hear
the
white
mare
pawing
the
ground
with
her
shoe
as
though
she
were
calling
her
master
henri
deslois
went
towards
the
door
then
he
came
back
to
me
and
picked
up
my
work
which
had
fallen
from
my
hands
without
my
having
noticed
it
he
kissed
his
sister
and
before
he
went
he
said
looking
at
me
i
shall
see
you
next
morning
madame
deslois
came
into
the
she
came
straight
to
me
and
was
very
rude
but
alphonse
told
her
to
be
quiet
and
turning
to
me
he
said
madame
alphonse
has
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
she
would
like
to
keep
you
in
her
service
but
she
wants
you
in
future
to
come
to
mass
with
us
he
tried
to
smile
and
added
we
will
drive
you
there
and
back
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
spoken
directly
to
me
his
voice
was
rather
husky
as
though
he
felt
some
awkwardness
in
saying
these
things
to
me
i
do
know
what
made
me
think
that
he
was
lying
and
that
madame
alphonse
had
not
said
anything
of
the
kind
besides
he
looked
so
much
like
the
mother
superior
that
i
could
not
help
defying
him
i
told
him
that
i
care
about
driving
and
that
i
should
go
to
mass
at
sainte
montagne
as
before
he
sucked
in
his
lower
lip
and
began
biting
it
then
madame
deslois
stepped
forward
threateningly
and
told
me
that
i
was
insolent
she
kept
on
repeating
this
word
as
though
she
could
not
find
any
others
she
shouted
it
more
and
more
loudly
and
lost
all
control
of
herself
the
white
of
her
eyes
was
becoming
quite
red
and
she
raised
her
hand
to
strike
me
i
stepped
back
quickly
behind
my
chair
madame
deslois
bumped
into
the
chair
and
knocked
it
over
and
caught
at
the
table
so
as
not
to
fall
down
her
harsh
voice
terrified
me
i
wanted
to
leave
the
but
alphonse
had
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
door
and
i
came
back
into
the
room
and
faced
madame
deslois
across
the
table
she
began
to
speak
again
in
a
strangled
sort
of
voice
she
used
words
which
i
did
understand
but
there
was
something
about
what
she
said
and
the
way
in
which
she
said
it
which
i
hated
at
last
she
stopped
speaking
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
forget
that
i
am
his
mother
alphonse
came
towards
me
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
said
come
now
listen
to
me
i
shook
myself
loose
pushed
him
away
and
ran
out
of
the
house
the
last
words
that
madame
deslois
had
said
hammered
on
my
brain
as
though
they
really
were
a
hammer
with
one
end
of
it
pointed
i
am
his
mother
do
you
hear
his
mother
oh
mother
how
beautiful
you
were
when
compared
to
this
other
mother
and
how
i
loved
you
how
your
eyes
beamed
and
lit
up
your
black
dress
and
how
pure
your
face
was
under
your
white
cap
i
could
see
you
as
clearly
as
though
you
were
really
in
front
of
me
i
was
quite
astonished
to
find
myself
in
front
of
the
house
on
the
hill
and
when
i
got
there
i
saw
that
snow
was
falling
in
a
regular
hurricane
i
went
into
the
house
for
shelter
and
went
straight
into
the
room
which
looked
out
on
the
garden
i
tried
to
think
but
my
ideas
whirled
round
in
my
head
like
the
which
looked
as
though
they
were
climbing
up
from
the
ground
and
falling
from
the
sky
at
the
same
time
and
every
time
that
i
made
an
effort
to
think
the
only
things
i
could
think
of
were
little
bits
of
a
song
which
the
children
used
to
sing
in
the
convent
and
which
ran
the
old
girl
jumped
and
jumped
about
and
jumped
until
she
died
the
old
girl
jumped
and
jumped
about
and
jumped
until
she
died
i
felt
less
unhappy
in
this
silent
house
the
softly
falling
snow
was
pretty
and
the
trees
were
as
beautiful
as
on
that
day
when
i
had
seen
them
all
in
bloom
then
suddenly
i
remembered
quite
clearly
all
that
had
just
happened
i
saw
madame
deslois
hand
with
its
square
fingers
and
shivered
all
over
what
an
ugly
hand
it
was
and
what
a
large
one
then
i
remembered
the
expression
on
alphonse
face
when
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
i
remembered
as
i
thought
of
it
that
i
had
seen
the
same
expression
once
before
on
a
little
girl
face
it
was
one
day
when
i
had
picked
up
a
pear
which
had
fallen
from
the
tree
she
had
rushed
at
me
saying
give
me
half
of
it
and
i
wo
tell
i
felt
so
disgusted
at
the
idea
of
sharing
it
with
her
that
although
sister
might
have
seen
me
i
had
gone
back
to
the
tree
and
put
the
pear
down
where
it
had
fallen
thinking
of
all
these
things
i
longed
and
longed
to
see
sister
again
i
should
have
liked
to
have
gone
to
her
at
once
but
i
remembered
that
henri
deslois
had
said
as
he
went
i
shall
see
you
perhaps
he
was
at
the
farm
already
waiting
for
me
and
wondering
what
had
become
of
me
i
went
out
of
the
house
to
run
back
to
villevieille
i
had
only
gone
a
few
steps
when
i
saw
him
coming
up
the
white
mare
did
find
it
very
easy
to
climb
the
path
henri
deslois
was
bareheaded
as
he
had
been
the
first
time
he
came
his
smock
billowed
out
with
the
wind
and
he
had
a
hand
on
the
mane
of
the
mare
the
mare
stood
in
front
of
me
her
master
leaned
down
and
took
my
two
hands
which
i
held
up
to
him
there
was
on
his
face
a
look
of
worry
which
i
had
never
seen
before
i
noticed
too
that
his
eyebrows
met
like
those
of
madame
deslois
he
was
a
little
out
of
breath
and
said
i
knew
that
i
should
find
you
here
he
opened
his
mouth
again
and
i
felt
quite
certain
that
his
words
were
going
to
bring
me
happiness
he
held
my
hands
tighter
and
said
in
the
same
breathless
voice
as
before
i
can
no
longer
be
your
friend
i
thought
that
somebody
had
struck
me
a
violent
blow
on
the
head
there
was
a
noise
of
a
saw
in
my
ears
i
could
see
henri
deslois
trembling
and
i
heard
him
say
how
cold
i
am
then
i
no
longer
felt
the
warmth
of
his
hand
on
mine
and
when
i
realized
that
i
was
standing
all
alone
in
the
path
i
saw
nothing
but
a
great
white
shape
which
was
slipping
noiselessly
across
the
snow
on
a
tant
fait
sauter
la
vieille
est
morte
en
sautillant
tireli
sautons
sautons
la
vieille
i
went
slowly
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill
walking
in
the
snow
which
squeaked
under
my
feet
about
a
peasant
offered
me
a
lift
in
his
cart
he
was
going
to
town
too
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
got
to
the
orphanage
i
rang
the
bell
and
the
porteress
looked
out
at
me
through
the
peephole
i
recognized
her
it
was
ox
eye
still
we
had
named
her
ox
eye
because
her
eyes
were
big
and
round
like
a
daisy
she
opened
the
gate
when
she
recognized
me
and
told
me
to
come
in
but
before
she
shut
the
gate
behind
me
she
said
sister
is
not
here
i
did
answer
so
she
said
again
sister
is
not
here
i
heard
what
she
said
quite
well
but
i
did
pay
any
attention
to
it
it
was
like
a
dream
where
the
most
extraordinary
things
happen
without
seeming
to
be
of
any
importance
at
all
i
looked
at
her
great
big
eyes
and
said
i
have
come
back
she
closed
the
gate
behind
me
and
left
me
standing
under
the
eaves
of
her
little
house
in
the
gateway
while
she
went
to
tell
the
mother
superior
she
came
back
saying
that
the
mother
superior
wanted
to
speak
to
sister
before
she
saw
me
a
bell
rang
ox
eye
got
up
and
told
me
to
go
with
her
it
was
snowing
again
it
was
almost
dark
in
the
mother
superior
room
at
first
i
saw
nothing
but
the
fire
which
was
whistling
and
flaming
then
i
heard
the
mother
superior
voice
so
you
have
come
back
she
said
i
tried
to
think
steadily
but
i
was
not
quite
sure
whether
i
had
come
back
or
not
she
said
sister
is
not
here
i
thought
that
my
bad
dream
was
coming
on
again
and
coughed
to
try
and
wake
myself
then
i
looked
at
the
fire
and
tried
to
find
out
why
it
whistled
like
that
the
mother
superior
spoke
again
are
you
ill
she
said
i
answered
no
the
heat
did
me
good
and
i
felt
better
i
was
beginning
to
understand
at
last
that
i
had
come
back
to
the
orphanage
and
that
i
was
in
the
mother
superior
room
my
eyes
met
hers
and
i
remembered
everything
she
laughed
a
little
and
said
you
have
not
changed
much
how
old
are
you
now
i
told
her
that
i
was
eighteen
years
old
really
she
said
going
out
into
the
world
has
not
made
you
grow
much
she
leaned
one
elbow
on
the
table
and
asked
me
why
i
had
come
back
i
wanted
to
tell
her
that
i
had
come
back
to
see
sister
but
i
was
afraid
of
hearing
her
say
once
more
that
sister
was
not
there
and
i
remained
silent
she
opened
a
drawer
took
out
a
letter
which
she
covered
with
her
open
hand
and
said
in
the
weary
voice
of
a
person
who
has
been
bothered
unnecessarily
this
letter
had
already
told
me
that
you
had
become
a
bold
proud
girl
she
pushed
the
letter
from
her
as
though
she
were
tired
and
in
a
long
breath
she
said
you
can
work
in
the
kitchen
here
until
we
find
you
something
else
to
do
the
fire
went
on
whistling
i
went
on
looking
at
it
but
i
could
not
make
out
which
of
the
three
logs
was
making
the
noise
the
mother
superior
raised
her
monotonous
voice
to
draw
my
attention
she
warned
me
that
sister
would
watch
me
very
closely
and
that
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
talk
to
my
former
companions
i
saw
her
point
to
the
door
and
i
went
out
into
the
snow
at
the
other
side
of
the
yard
i
could
see
the
kitchens
sister
who
was
tall
and
slim
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
but
her
cap
and
her
black
dress
and
i
imagined
her
to
be
old
and
withered
i
thought
of
running
away
i
need
only
run
to
the
gate
and
tell
ox
eye
that
i
had
come
on
a
visit
she
would
let
me
out
and
that
would
be
all
instead
of
going
to
the
gate
i
went
towards
the
buildings
where
i
had
lived
when
i
was
a
child
i
did
know
why
i
went
there
but
i
could
not
help
it
i
felt
very
tired
and
i
should
have
liked
to
lie
down
and
sleep
for
a
long
time
the
old
bench
was
in
the
same
place
i
wiped
some
of
the
snow
off
it
with
my
hands
and
sat
down
leaning
against
the
linden
tree
as
le
curé
used
to
do
i
was
waiting
for
something
and
i
did
know
what
i
looked
up
at
the
window
of
sister
room
the
pretty
embroidered
curtains
were
no
longer
there
and
although
the
window
was
just
like
the
other
windows
now
i
thought
it
quite
different
and
though
the
thick
calico
curtains
were
the
same
in
this
room
as
in
the
others
they
seemed
to
me
to
make
that
window
look
like
a
face
with
its
eyes
shut
the
yard
began
to
get
dark
and
the
lights
lit
up
the
rooms
inside
i
meant
to
get
up
from
the
bench
thinking
ox
eye
will
open
the
gate
for
me
but
my
body
felt
crushed
and
i
seemed
to
have
two
broad
hard
hands
weighing
heavily
on
my
head
and
as
though
i
had
spoken
them
aloud
the
words
ox
eye
will
open
the
gate
for
me
repeated
themselves
over
and
over
again
all
of
a
sudden
a
voice
with
pity
in
it
said
quite
close
to
me
please
marie
claire
do
sit
out
here
in
the
snow
i
raised
my
head
and
standing
in
front
of
me
was
a
young
quite
young
sister
whose
face
was
so
beautiful
that
i
could
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
such
a
face
before
she
bent
over
me
to
help
me
up
and
as
i
could
hardly
stand
upright
she
put
my
arm
under
hers
and
said
lean
on
me
then
i
saw
that
she
was
taking
me
to
the
kitchen
the
great
glass
door
of
which
was
bright
with
light
i
think
of
anything
the
snow
pricked
my
face
and
my
eyelids
were
burning
when
i
went
into
the
kitchen
i
recognized
the
two
girls
who
were
standing
by
the
big
square
oven
they
were
veronique
the
minx
and
mélanie
the
plump
and
i
seemed
to
hear
sister
talking
to
them
by
these
names
mélanie
nodded
to
me
as
i
passed
her
and
leaning
on
the
young
sister
arm
i
went
into
a
room
in
which
there
was
a
burning
the
room
was
divided
into
two
by
a
big
white
curtain
the
young
sister
made
me
sit
down
on
a
chair
which
she
took
from
behind
the
curtain
and
went
out
without
saying
a
word
a
little
while
afterwards
mélanie
the
plump
and
veronique
the
minx
came
in
to
put
clean
sheets
on
the
little
iron
bed
beside
me
when
they
had
finished
veronique
who
had
not
looked
at
me
at
all
till
then
turned
to
me
and
said
that
nobody
had
ever
thought
that
i
should
come
back
she
said
it
as
though
she
were
reproaching
me
for
something
shameful
mélanie
put
her
hands
together
under
her
chin
and
put
her
head
on
one
side
just
as
she
used
to
do
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
smiled
affectionately
at
me
and
said
i
am
very
glad
that
you
have
been
sent
to
the
kitchen
then
she
patted
the
bed
and
said
you
are
taking
my
place
i
used
to
sleep
here
she
pointed
to
the
curtain
and
in
a
low
voice
she
said
this
is
where
sister
sleeps
when
they
had
gone
out
closing
the
door
behind
them
i
sat
closer
to
the
bed
the
big
white
curtain
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
i
thought
i
could
see
shadows
moving
in
the
folds
which
the
left
in
darkness
then
i
heard
the
i
recognized
it
and
without
knowing
what
i
was
doing
i
counted
the
strokes
everything
was
quite
still
for
some
time
and
then
the
young
sister
came
into
the
room
bringing
me
a
bowl
of
steaming
soup
she
pulled
the
big
curtain
back
and
said
this
is
your
room
and
that
is
mine
i
felt
quite
reassured
when
i
saw
that
her
little
iron
bedstead
was
exactly
the
same
as
my
own
i
began
to
wonder
whether
she
was
sister
but
i
dared
not
believe
it
and
asked
her
she
nodded
yes
and
drawing
her
chair
close
to
mine
she
put
her
face
in
the
full
light
and
said
do
you
recognize
me
i
looked
at
her
without
answering
no
i
did
recognize
her
in
fact
i
was
certain
that
i
had
never
seen
her
for
i
was
certain
that
one
could
never
forget
her
face
if
one
had
seen
it
once
she
made
a
funny
little
grimace
and
said
i
can
see
you
do
remember
poor
désirée
joly
désirée
joly
of
course
i
remembered
her
she
was
a
girl
who
had
become
a
novice
her
face
was
rosier
than
roses
she
had
a
beautiful
slim
figure
and
used
to
laugh
all
day
long
we
all
loved
her
she
used
to
jump
about
so
when
she
played
with
us
that
sister
often
used
to
say
to
her
come
now
come
now
not
so
high
please
mademoiselle
joly
you
are
showing
your
knees
even
now
when
i
was
looking
at
her
i
could
not
remember
her
she
said
yes
the
dress
makes
a
lot
of
difference
she
pulled
up
her
sleeves
and
making
the
same
funny
little
face
again
she
said
forget
that
i
am
sister
and
remember
that
désirée
joly
used
to
be
very
fond
of
you
then
she
went
on
quickly
i
recognized
you
at
once
she
said
you
still
have
the
same
baby
face
when
i
told
her
i
had
imagined
sister
to
be
old
and
cross
she
answered
we
were
both
wrong
i
had
been
told
that
you
were
vain
and
proud
but
when
i
saw
you
crying
in
the
middle
of
the
snow
i
thought
only
that
you
were
suffering
and
i
went
to
you
when
she
had
helped
me
to
bed
she
divided
the
room
again
with
the
curtain
and
i
went
to
sleep
at
once
but
i
did
sleep
well
i
woke
up
every
minute
there
was
a
heavy
stone
on
my
chest
still
and
when
i
managed
to
throw
it
off
it
split
up
into
several
pieces
which
fell
back
on
me
and
crushed
my
limbs
then
i
dreamed
that
i
was
on
a
road
full
of
sharp
pointed
stones
which
cut
me
i
walked
along
it
with
difficulty
on
both
sides
of
the
road
there
were
fields
vines
and
houses
all
the
houses
were
covered
with
snow
but
the
trees
were
laden
with
fruit
and
were
in
bright
sunshine
i
left
the
road
and
went
into
the
fields
stopping
at
all
the
trees
to
taste
the
fruit
but
the
fruit
was
bitter
and
i
threw
it
away
i
tried
to
go
into
the
houses
but
they
had
no
doors
i
went
back
on
to
the
road
and
the
stones
gathered
round
me
so
fast
that
i
could
not
go
on
then
i
called
for
help
i
called
as
loud
as
i
could
but
nobody
heard
me
and
when
i
felt
i
was
going
to
be
buried
under
a
huge
heap
of
stones
i
struggled
so
hard
to
get
away
from
them
that
i
woke
myself
up
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
was
still
dreaming
the
ceiling
of
the
room
seemed
to
be
a
tremendous
height
the
rod
from
which
the
white
curtain
was
hanging
glittered
here
and
there
and
the
branch
of
boxwood
which
was
nailed
to
the
wall
threw
a
shadow
on
the
statue
of
the
virgin
which
was
in
the
corner
then
a
cock
crowed
he
crowed
several
times
as
though
he
wanted
to
make
me
forget
his
first
crow
which
had
stopped
short
as
if
he
were
in
pain
the
began
to
flicker
it
flickered
for
a
long
time
before
it
went
out
and
when
the
room
was
quite
dark
i
heard
sister
breathing
gently
and
regularly
long
before
daybreak
i
got
up
to
begin
my
work
in
the
kitchen
mélanie
showed
me
how
to
lift
the
big
coppers
it
was
a
matter
of
skill
as
well
as
of
strength
it
took
me
more
than
a
week
before
i
could
even
move
one
of
them
mélanie
taught
me
how
to
ring
the
heavy
waking
bell
she
showed
me
how
to
put
my
shoulders
into
the
work
so
as
to
pull
the
rope
and
i
soon
got
into
the
way
of
it
and
every
morning
whether
it
were
cold
or
raining
i
used
to
enjoy
ringing
the
bell
it
had
a
clear
sound
which
the
wind
increased
or
lessened
and
i
never
got
tired
of
hearing
it
there
were
days
when
i
rang
so
long
that
sister
would
open
her
window
and
would
say
pleadingly
that
do
that
do
since
i
had
come
to
the
kitchen
veronique
the
minx
used
to
look
away
from
me
when
she
spoke
and
if
i
asked
her
where
anything
was
she
would
point
to
it
without
speaking
sister
used
to
watch
her
and
would
curl
her
lip
as
she
watched
she
was
not
as
as
she
used
to
be
when
she
was
a
novice
but
she
was
full
of
life
still
and
full
of
fun
every
evening
we
used
to
meet
in
our
room
and
she
would
make
me
laugh
at
her
remarks
at
what
had
been
going
on
during
the
day
sometimes
my
laughter
ended
in
a
sob
then
she
used
to
put
her
hands
together
as
the
saints
do
in
the
pictures
raise
her
eyes
and
say
oh
how
i
wish
that
your
sorrow
would
leave
you
then
she
would
kneel
on
the
ground
and
pray
and
i
often
used
to
go
to
sleep
before
she
got
up
again
work
in
the
kitchen
was
very
hard
i
used
to
help
mélanie
polish
up
the
coppers
and
wash
the
tiled
floors
she
did
most
of
the
work
herself
she
was
as
strong
as
a
man
and
was
always
ready
to
help
me
as
soon
as
she
found
that
i
was
tired
she
used
to
force
me
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
and
would
say
smilingly
recreation
time
a
few
days
after
i
had
arrived
she
reminded
me
of
the
difficulties
she
used
to
have
in
learning
her
catechism
she
had
not
forgotten
that
during
a
whole
season
i
had
spent
all
my
recreation
time
trying
to
teach
her
to
learn
it
by
heart
and
now
she
delighted
in
making
me
rest
veronique
work
was
the
preparation
of
the
vegetables
and
she
also
took
the
meat
in
from
the
butcher
she
used
to
stand
stiffly
by
the
scales
until
the
butcher
boys
put
the
meat
on
she
was
always
grumbling
at
them
saying
that
the
meat
was
cut
too
small
or
cut
too
big
the
butcher
boys
used
to
get
angry
with
her
and
were
rude
to
her
sometimes
and
sister
told
me
at
last
to
take
the
meat
in
instead
of
her
she
came
to
the
scales
just
the
same
next
day
but
i
was
there
with
sister
who
was
telling
me
how
to
weigh
the
meat
one
morning
one
of
the
two
butchers
looked
at
me
and
spoke
my
name
sister
and
i
looked
at
the
butcher
boy
in
surprise
he
was
a
new
one
but
i
soon
recognized
him
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
jean
le
rouge
he
was
delighted
to
see
me
again
and
told
me
that
his
parents
had
got
a
good
place
at
the
lost
ford
he
himself
did
care
about
working
in
the
fields
and
had
found
work
with
a
butcher
in
the
town
then
he
told
me
that
the
lost
ford
was
quite
near
villevieille
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
it
i
nodded
my
head
to
say
that
i
did
he
went
on
to
say
that
his
father
and
mother
had
been
there
for
some
months
and
that
there
had
been
feasting
there
last
week
because
henri
deslois
was
married
i
heard
him
say
a
few
words
more
which
i
understand
then
the
daylight
in
the
kitchen
turned
into
black
night
and
i
felt
the
tiles
give
way
under
my
feet
and
drag
me
down
into
a
bottomless
hole
i
remember
sister
coming
to
help
me
but
an
animal
had
fastened
itself
on
my
chest
it
made
a
dreadful
sound
which
it
hurt
me
to
hear
it
was
like
a
horrible
sob
which
always
stopped
at
the
same
place
then
the
light
came
back
again
and
i
could
see
above
me
the
faces
of
sister
and
mélanie
both
were
smiling
anxiously
and
mélanie
broad
red
face
looked
like
sister
pointed
pale
one
i
sat
up
in
bed
wondering
why
i
was
there
by
daylight
but
i
did
get
up
i
remembered
little
jean
le
rouge
and
for
hours
and
hours
i
fought
with
my
pain
when
sister
came
into
the
room
at
bedtime
she
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
my
bed
she
put
her
two
hands
together
like
the
saints
did
tell
me
of
your
sorrow
she
said
i
told
her
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
word
i
spoke
took
some
of
my
suffering
away
with
it
when
i
had
told
her
everything
sister
fetched
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
and
began
to
read
aloud
she
read
in
a
gentle
and
resigned
voice
and
there
were
words
which
sounded
like
the
end
of
a
moan
on
the
days
which
followed
i
saw
little
jean
le
rouge
again
he
told
me
some
more
about
the
lost
ford
and
while
he
said
how
happy
his
parents
were
and
how
kind
the
master
was
to
them
i
could
see
the
house
on
the
hill
with
its
garden
in
flower
and
its
spring
from
which
the
little
brooklets
crawled
down
to
the
river
hiding
themselves
under
the
broom
i
often
spoke
of
it
to
sister
who
listened
to
me
meditatively
she
knew
the
neighbourhood
and
every
corner
of
the
place
and
one
evening
when
she
sat
dreaming
and
i
asked
her
what
she
was
thinking
about
she
said
summer
will
be
over
soon
and
i
was
thinking
that
the
trees
were
full
of
fruit
during
the
month
of
september
a
number
of
religious
paid
visits
to
the
mother
superior
ox
eye
used
to
ring
the
bell
to
announce
them
every
time
she
rang
veronique
went
out
to
see
who
was
coming
in
she
always
had
something
disagreeable
to
say
about
each
one
of
the
sisters
whom
she
recognized
one
evening
the
bell
sounded
veronique
who
was
looking
out
said
well
here
one
whom
nobody
expected
she
put
her
head
into
the
kitchen
again
and
said
it
is
sister
the
big
spoon
which
i
had
in
my
hand
slipped
through
my
fingers
and
dropped
into
the
copper
i
rushed
to
the
door
pushing
past
veronique
who
wanted
to
keep
me
back
mélanie
rushed
after
me
do
she
said
the
mother
superior
can
see
you
but
i
rushed
out
to
sister
i
rushed
into
her
arms
with
such
force
that
we
nearly
fell
over
together
she
clasped
me
tight
and
held
me
she
was
trembling
and
almost
crazy
with
joy
she
took
my
head
in
her
hands
and
as
if
i
had
been
quite
a
little
child
she
kissed
me
all
over
my
face
her
stiff
linen
cap
made
a
noise
like
paper
when
you
crumple
it
up
and
her
broad
sleeves
fell
back
to
her
shoulders
mélanie
was
right
the
mother
superior
saw
me
she
came
out
of
the
chapel
and
came
towards
us
sister
saw
her
she
stopped
kissing
me
and
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
put
my
arm
round
her
fearing
that
she
would
be
taken
away
from
me
and
the
two
of
us
stood
and
watched
the
mother
superior
she
passed
in
front
of
us
without
raising
her
eyes
and
did
seem
to
see
sister
who
bowed
gravely
to
her
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
i
dragged
sister
off
to
the
old
bench
she
stopped
a
moment
and
before
sitting
down
she
said
it
is
as
though
things
were
waiting
for
us
she
sat
down
she
leaned
against
the
linden
tree
and
i
kneeled
down
in
the
grass
at
her
feet
there
were
no
more
rays
in
her
eyes
it
was
as
though
the
colours
in
them
had
all
been
mixed
up
together
her
dear
little
face
had
grown
smaller
and
seemed
to
have
gone
further
back
into
her
cap
her
stomacher
had
not
the
beautiful
curve
on
her
chest
that
it
used
to
have
and
her
hands
were
so
thin
that
the
blue
veins
in
them
showed
up
quite
clearly
she
hardly
glanced
at
the
window
of
her
room
but
looked
out
on
the
linden
trees
and
round
the
courtyard
and
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
mother
superior
house
these
words
fell
from
her
like
a
sigh
we
must
forgive
others
if
we
wish
to
be
forgiven
then
she
looked
at
me
again
and
said
your
eyes
are
sad
she
passed
the
palms
of
her
hands
over
my
eyes
as
if
she
wanted
to
wipe
out
something
which
displeased
her
and
keeping
them
there
so
that
my
eyes
remained
shut
how
we
suffer
she
said
then
she
took
her
hands
away
and
clasped
mine
and
with
her
eyes
on
my
face
she
said
as
though
she
were
praying
my
sweet
daughter
listen
to
me
never
become
a
poor
religious
she
heaved
a
long
sigh
of
regret
and
said
our
dress
of
black
and
white
tells
others
that
we
are
creatures
of
strength
and
of
brightness
at
our
bidding
all
tears
are
dried
and
all
who
suffer
come
to
us
for
consolation
but
nobody
thinks
of
our
own
suffering
we
are
like
women
without
faces
then
she
spoke
of
the
future
she
said
i
am
going
where
the
missionaries
go
i
shall
live
there
in
a
house
full
of
terror
before
my
eyes
will
pass
unceasingly
everything
that
is
hideous
everything
that
is
ugly
everything
that
is
bad
i
listened
to
her
deep
voice
there
was
a
note
of
passion
in
it
it
was
as
though
she
were
taking
on
to
her
own
shoulders
all
the
suffering
of
the
world
her
fingers
loosed
mine
she
passed
them
over
my
cheeks
and
in
a
gentle
voice
and
sweet
she
said
the
purity
of
your
face
will
always
remain
graven
on
my
mind
then
she
looked
out
away
and
past
me
and
added
god
has
given
us
remembrance
and
it
is
not
in
anybody
power
to
take
that
away
from
us
she
got
up
from
the
bench
i
went
with
her
across
the
yard
and
when
ox
eye
had
closed
the
heavy
gate
behind
her
i
stood
and
listened
to
the
echo
of
its
closing
that
evening
sister
came
into
the
room
later
than
usual
she
had
been
taking
part
in
special
prayer
for
sister
who
was
going
away
to
nurse
the
lepers
winter
came
again
sister
had
soon
guessed
my
love
of
reading
and
she
brought
me
all
the
books
in
the
sisters
library
one
after
the
other
most
of
the
books
were
childish
books
and
i
read
quickly
turning
over
several
pages
at
a
time
i
preferred
stories
of
travel
and
i
used
to
read
at
night
by
the
sister
used
to
scold
me
when
she
woke
up
but
as
soon
as
she
went
to
sleep
i
took
up
the
book
again
little
by
little
we
became
great
friends
the
white
curtain
was
no
longer
drawn
between
our
beds
at
night
time
all
sense
of
constraint
had
disappeared
between
us
and
all
our
thoughts
were
in
common
she
was
cheerful
and
bright
always
the
one
thing
that
annoyed
her
in
her
life
was
her
nun
costume
she
found
it
heavy
and
uncomfortable
and
she
used
to
say
that
it
hurt
her
when
i
dress
she
said
i
always
feel
as
though
i
were
putting
myself
into
a
house
where
it
is
always
night
she
was
always
glad
to
get
out
of
her
dress
in
the
evening
and
loved
walking
about
the
room
in
her
she
used
to
say
making
that
funny
little
face
i
am
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
but
at
first
that
cap
crushed
my
cheeks
and
the
dress
weighed
my
shoulders
down
when
the
spring
came
she
began
to
cough
she
had
a
little
dry
cough
which
used
to
make
itself
heard
from
time
to
time
and
her
long
slim
body
seemed
to
become
more
fragile
than
ever
she
was
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
before
but
she
complained
that
her
dress
became
heavier
and
heavier
one
night
in
may
she
tossed
about
and
dreamed
aloud
i
had
been
reading
all
night
and
noticed
all
of
a
sudden
that
daylight
was
coming
i
blew
out
the
and
tried
to
sleep
a
little
i
was
just
dropping
off
when
sister
said
open
the
window
he
is
coming
i
looked
to
see
whether
she
was
asleep
and
saw
that
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
she
had
drawn
back
her
blanket
and
was
untying
the
strings
of
her
she
took
it
off
and
threw
it
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
then
she
shook
her
head
her
short
hair
rolled
into
curls
on
her
forehead
and
i
recognized
désirée
joly
at
once
i
was
a
little
bit
frightened
and
got
up
she
said
again
open
the
window
and
let
him
in
i
opened
the
window
wide
and
when
i
turned
round
sister
was
holding
out
her
clasped
hands
towards
the
sun
and
in
a
voice
which
had
suddenly
grown
weaker
she
said
i
have
taken
off
my
dress
i
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
she
lay
down
quietly
and
her
face
became
quite
still
i
held
my
breath
for
a
long
time
to
listen
to
hers
then
i
breathed
hard
as
though
i
could
give
her
my
breath
but
when
i
looked
at
her
more
closely
i
saw
that
she
had
breathed
her
last
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
seemed
to
be
looking
at
a
sunbeam
which
was
coming
towards
her
like
a
long
arrow
swallows
flew
past
the
window
and
flew
back
again
chirruping
like
little
girls
and
my
ears
were
filled
with
sounds
which
i
had
never
heard
before
i
looked
up
to
the
windows
of
the
dormitories
hoping
that
somebody
would
hear
what
i
had
to
say
but
i
saw
nothing
but
the
face
of
the
big
clock
which
seemed
to
be
looking
down
into
the
room
over
the
linden
trees
it
was
five
i
pulled
the
blanket
up
over
sister
and
went
out
and
rang
the
bell
i
rang
for
a
long
time
the
notes
went
far
far
away
they
went
right
away
to
where
sister
had
gone
i
went
on
ringing
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
bells
were
telling
the
world
that
sister
was
dead
i
went
on
ringing
too
because
i
hoped
that
she
would
pop
her
beautiful
face
out
of
the
window
and
say
that
do
that
do
marie
claire
mélanie
pulled
the
rope
out
of
my
hands
the
bell
which
was
up
fell
back
all
wrong
and
gave
a
sort
of
groan
you
have
been
ringing
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
mélanie
said
i
answered
sister
is
dead
veronique
went
into
the
room
after
us
she
noticed
that
the
white
curtain
was
not
drawn
between
the
two
beds
and
said
that
she
thought
it
was
disgraceful
for
a
religious
to
let
her
hair
be
seen
mélanie
passed
her
finger
over
a
tear
which
was
rolling
down
each
of
her
cheeks
her
head
was
more
on
one
side
than
ever
and
she
whispered
quite
low
she
is
even
prettier
than
she
was
before
the
sunshine
bathed
the
bed
and
covered
the
dead
woman
from
head
to
foot
i
remained
with
her
all
day
some
of
the
sisters
came
to
see
her
one
of
them
covered
her
face
with
a
napkin
but
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
i
uncovered
it
again
mélanie
came
and
spent
the
night
by
the
bedside
with
me
when
she
had
closed
the
window
she
lit
the
big
lamp
so
that
sister
should
not
be
in
the
dark
she
said
a
week
afterwards
ox
eye
came
to
the
kitchen
she
told
me
to
get
ready
to
go
the
same
day
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
she
held
two
gold
pieces
which
she
put
side
by
side
on
the
corner
of
the
oven
and
touching
one
after
the
other
with
her
finger
she
said
our
mother
superior
sends
you
forty
francs
i
did
not
want
to
go
away
without
saying
to
colette
and
to
ismérie
whom
i
had
often
seen
at
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
but
mélanie
assured
me
that
they
did
care
for
me
any
more
colette
could
not
understand
why
i
was
not
married
yet
and
ismérie
could
not
forgive
me
for
being
so
fond
of
sister
mélanie
went
to
the
gate
with
me
as
we
passed
the
old
bench
i
saw
that
one
of
its
legs
was
broken
and
that
one
end
of
it
had
fallen
into
the
grass
at
the
gate
i
found
a
woman
waiting
her
eyes
were
hard
she
said
i
am
your
sister
i
did
recognize
her
it
was
twelve
years
since
i
had
seen
her
directly
we
got
outside
she
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
in
a
voice
as
hard
as
her
eyes
she
asked
me
how
much
money
i
had
i
showed
her
the
two
gold
pieces
which
i
had
just
received
then
she
said
you
will
do
better
to
remain
in
the
town
where
you
will
find
it
easier
to
get
something
to
do
as
we
walked
on
she
told
me
she
was
married
to
a
gardener
in
the
neighbourhood
and
that
she
did
intend
to
give
herself
any
particular
trouble
over
me
we
got
to
the
railway
station
she
took
me
on
to
the
platform
because
she
wanted
me
to
help
her
carry
some
parcels
she
said
when
her
train
went
off
and
i
remained
there
and
watched
it
go
almost
immediately
another
train
stopped
the
railway
men
ran
up
and
down
the
platform
calling
to
the
passengers
for
paris
to
cross
over
in
that
one
moment
i
saw
paris
with
its
great
houses
like
palaces
with
roofs
so
high
that
they
were
lost
in
the
clouds
a
young
man
bumped
into
me
he
stopped
and
said
are
you
going
to
paris
mademoiselle
i
scarcely
hesitated
and
said
yes
but
i
have
no
ticket
he
held
out
his
hand
give
me
the
money
he
said
and
i
will
go
and
get
it
for
you
i
gave
him
one
of
my
two
gold
coins
and
he
ran
off
i
put
the
ticket
and
the
change
in
copper
which
he
had
brought
me
into
my
pocket
went
across
the
line
with
him
and
climbed
into
the
train
the
young
man
stood
at
the
carriage
door
for
a
minute
and
went
off
turning
back
once
as
he
went
his
eyes
were
full
of
gentleness
like
those
of
henri
deslois
the
train
whistled
once
as
though
to
warn
me
and
as
it
moved
off
it
whistled
a
second
time
a
long
whistle
like
a
scream
the
end
afterword
and
now
may
i
tell
you
what
i
know
about
marguerite
audoux
the
author
of
the
book
you
have
just
read
i
know
very
little
more
of
her
than
you
do
for
you
have
read
the
book
and
marguerite
audoux
is
marie
claire
if
marie
claire
in
english
does
not
please
you
the
fault
is
mine
i
have
tried
hard
to
translate
into
english
the
uneducated
unspoilt
purity
of
language
the
purity
of
thought
which
are
the
characteristics
of
the
french
but
the
task
was
no
easy
one
much
as
i
loved
it
in
the
doing
marguerite
audoux
herself
is
a
plump
and
placid
little
woman
of
about
she
lives
in
a
garret
in
the
rue
leopold
robert
in
paris
from
her
window
she
has
a
view
of
and
the
montparnasse
cemetery
when
she
learned
of
the
success
of
her
book
with
which
she
had
lived
for
six
years
she
cried
i
felt
dreadfully
frightened
at
first
she
said
i
felt
very
uneasy
i
felt
as
though
i
had
become
known
too
quickly
as
though
i
were
a
criminal
of
note
now
my
one
wish
is
to
work
again
she
reads
a
good
deal
her
favourite
authors
are
chateaubriand
and
maeterlinck
in
maeterlinck
she
loves
the
mystery
we
never
know
people
properly
she
says
they
are
just
as
difficult
to
understand
as
things
that
happen
are
we
never
know
whose
fault
it
is
when
good
or
bad
things
happen
and
we
do
really
know
whether
we
ought
to
be
angry
or
to
be
sorry
with
people
who
do
harm
wicked
people
are
like
a
thunderstorm
do
you
think
and
a
lazy
woman
is
like
a
hot
room
both
are
unhealthy
but
they
can
not
help
it
marguerite
audoux
does
not
say
these
things
to
be
clever
she
says
them
quite
simply
and
they
express
her
natural
way
of
thought
which
is
simplicity
and
purity
itself
she
wrote
her
book
when
and
how
she
could
on
scraps
of
cheap
paper
and
she
does
not
know
herself
now
whether
she
hoped
to
have
it
published
when
she
wrote
it
she
did
hope
for
publication
when
she
had
finished
it
but
that
was
because
she
was
hungry
i
met
a
friend
just
outside
marguerite
audoux
house
after
my
first
visit
to
her
tiens
he
said
tu
viens
de
la
mansarde
de
génie
and
the
clever
little
pun
was
true
marguerite
audoux
is
a
genius
and
she
does
not
understand
what
people
mean
when
they
ask
her
how
she
writes
she
opens
her
weak
eyes
very
wide
at
the
question
laughs
as
a
child
laughs
when
it
does
understand
and
says
but
i
do
know
the
thoughts
come
and
i
write
them
down
i
only
wish
that
i
could
spell
them
better
when
the
committee
of
the
vie
heureuse
was
voting
on
her
book
before
awarding
her
the
pound
prize
for
the
best
book
of
the
year
somebody
suggested
the
possibility
that
she
had
had
help
with
it
madame
séverine
was
sent
to
fetch
the
manuscript
it
was
passed
round
examined
and
no
more
doubt
was
possible
i
hope
you
will
find
the
pleasure
in
reading
marie
claire
that
i
found
in
translating
it
i
should
like
to
say
quite
earnestly
and
perhaps
a
little
shamefacedly
because
we
hate
saying
these
things
out
loud
that
when
i
had
read
it
i
felt
awed
the
book
had
worked
upon
me
do
you
remember
the
impression
made
on
you
by
moonlight
upon
the
snow
in
the
country
you
must
be
quite
alone
to
feel
it
the
purity
of
it
all
makes
you
wish
that
you
were
a
cleaner
man
or
woman
and
till
you
rub
shoulders
with
people
again
you
mean
to
try
hard
to
be
cleaner
and
better
marie
claire
made
me
feel
just
exactly
like
that
