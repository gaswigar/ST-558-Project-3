preface
this
book
was
written
in
for
the
amusement
of
my
wife
and
myself
at
a
time
when
life
was
not
very
amusing
it
was
published
at
the
end
of
was
reviewed
if
at
all
as
one
of
a
parcel
by
some
brisk
uncle
from
the
tiny
tots
department
and
died
quietly
without
seriously
detracting
from
the
interest
which
was
being
taken
in
the
world
war
then
in
progress
it
may
be
that
the
circumstances
in
which
the
book
was
written
have
made
me
unduly
fond
of
it
when
as
sometimes
happens
i
am
introduced
to
a
stranger
who
starts
the
conversation
on
the
right
lines
by
praising
however
insincerely
my
books
i
always
say
but
you
have
not
read
the
best
one
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
is
so
the
tenth
takes
a
place
in
the
family
calendar
michael
or
agatha
as
the
case
may
be
a
or
saint
according
to
whether
the
book
was
bought
or
borrowed
but
there
are
few
such
saints
and
both
my
publisher
and
i
have
the
feeling
so
common
to
publishers
and
authors
that
there
ought
to
be
more
so
here
comes
the
book
again
in
a
new
dress
with
new
decorations
yet
much
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
same
book
making
the
same
appeal
to
me
but
let
us
hope
a
new
appeal
this
time
to
others
for
whom
then
is
the
book
intended
that
is
the
trouble
unless
i
can
say
for
those
young
or
old
who
like
the
things
which
i
like
i
find
it
difficult
to
answer
is
it
a
children
book
well
what
do
we
mean
by
that
is
wind
in
the
a
children
book
is
in
wonderland
is
island
these
are
masterpieces
which
we
read
with
pleasure
as
children
but
with
how
much
more
pleasure
when
we
are
in
any
case
what
do
we
mean
by
children
a
boy
of
three
a
girl
of
six
a
boy
of
ten
a
girl
of
fourteen
are
they
all
to
like
the
same
thing
and
is
a
book
suitable
for
a
boy
of
twelve
any
more
likely
to
please
a
boy
of
twelve
than
a
modern
novel
is
likely
to
please
a
man
of
even
if
the
novel
be
described
truly
as
suitable
for
a
man
of
i
confess
that
i
can
not
grapple
with
these
difficult
problems
but
i
am
very
sure
of
this
that
no
one
can
write
a
book
which
children
will
like
unless
he
write
it
for
himself
first
that
being
so
i
shall
say
boldly
that
this
is
a
story
for
how
i
did
not
realise
until
i
received
a
letter
from
an
unknown
reader
a
few
weeks
after
its
first
publication
a
letter
which
said
that
he
was
delighted
with
my
clever
satires
of
the
kaiser
lloyd
george
and
asquith
but
he
could
not
be
sure
which
of
the
characters
were
meant
to
be
winston
churchill
and
bonar
law
would
i
tell
him
on
the
enclosed
postcard
i
replied
that
they
were
thinly
disguised
on
the
as
hodder
stoughton
in
fact
it
is
not
that
sort
of
book
but
as
you
see
i
am
still
finding
it
difficult
to
explain
just
what
sort
of
book
it
is
perhaps
no
explanation
is
necessary
read
in
it
what
you
like
read
it
to
whomever
you
like
be
of
what
age
you
like
it

only
fall

you
will
enjoy

said

made
a
jump
towards

glided

was
a
man
of
simple
king
merriwig
of
euralia
sat
at
breakfast
on
his
castle
walls
he
lifted
the
gold
cover
from
the
gold
dish
in
front
of
him
selected
a
trout
and
conveyed
it
carefully
to
his
gold
plate
he
was
a
man
of
simple
tastes
but
when
you
have
an
aunt
with
the
newly
acquired
gift
of
turning
anything
she
touches
to
gold
you
must
let
her
practise
sometimes
in
another
age
it
might
have
been
fretwork
ah
said
the
king
here
you
are
my
dear
he
searched
for
his
napkin
but
the
princess
had
already
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
top
of
the
head
and
was
sitting
in
her
place
opposite
to
him
good
morning
father
she
said
i
a
little
late
are
i
been
riding
in
the
forest
any
adventures
asked
the
king
casually
nothing
except
it
a
beautiful
morning
ah
well
perhaps
the
country
is
what
it
was
now
when
i
was
a
young
man
you
simply
could
go
into
the
forest
without
an
adventure
of
some
sort
the
extraordinary
things
one
encountered
witches
giants
dwarfs
it
was
there
that
i
first
met
your
mother
he
added
thoughtfully
i
wish
i
remembered
my
mother
said
hyacinth
the
king
coughed
and
looked
at
her
a
little
nervously
seventeen
years
ago
she
died
hyacinth
when
you
were
only
six
months
old
i
have
been
wondering
lately
whether
i
have
been
a
little
remiss
in
leaving
you
motherless
so
long
the
princess
looked
puzzled
but
it
was
your
fault
dear
that
mother
died
oh
no
no
i
not
saying
that
as
you
know
a
dragon
carried
her
off
and
well
there
it
was
but
supposing
he
looked
at
her
shyly
i
had
married
again
the
princess
was
startled
who
she
asked
the
king
peered
into
his
flagon
well
he
said
there
people
if
it
had
been
somebody
nice
said
the
princess
wistfully
it
might
have
been
rather
lovely
the
king
gazed
earnestly
at
the
outside
of
his
flagon
why
have
been
he
said
the
princess
was
still
puzzled
but
i
grown
up
she
said
i
do
want
a
mother
so
much
now
the
king
turned
his
flagon
round
and
studied
the
other
side
of
it
a
mother
er
tender
hand
he
said
is
er
never
and
then
the
outrageous
thing
happened
it
was
all
because
of
a
birthday
present
to
the
king
of
barodia
and
the
present
was
nothing
less
than
a
pair
of
boots
the
king
being
a
busy
man
it
was
a
week
or
more
before
he
had
an
opportunity
of
trying
those
boots
meanwhile
he
used
to
talk
about
them
at
meals
and
he
would
polish
them
up
every
night
before
he
went
to
bed
when
the
great
day
came
for
the
first
trial
of
them
to
be
made
he
took
a
patronising
farewell
of
his
wife
and
family
ignored
the
many
eager
noses
pressed
against
the
upper
windows
of
the
palace
and
sailed
off
the
motion
as
perhaps
you
know
is
a
little
disquieting
at
first
but
one
soon
gets
used
to
it
after
that
it
is
fascinating
he
had
gone
some
two
thousand
miles
before
he
realised
that
there
might
be
a
difficulty
about
finding
his
way
back
the
difficulty
proved
at
least
as
great
as
he
had
anticipated
for
the
rest
of
that
day
he
toured
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
country
and
it
was
by
the
merest
accident
that
a
very
angry
king
shot
in
through
an
open
pantry
window
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
removed
his
boots
and
went
softly
to
bed
it
was
of
course
a
lesson
to
him
he
decided
that
in
the
future
he
must
proceed
by
a
recognised
route
sailing
lightly
from
landmark
to
landmark
such
a
route
his
geographers
prepared
for
him
an
early
morning
constitutional
of
three
hundred
miles
or
so
to
be
taken
ten
times
before
breakfast
he
gave
himself
a
week
in
which
to
recover
his
nerve
and
then
started
out
on
the
first
of
them
illustration
most
extraordinary
said
the
now
the
kingdom
of
euralia
adjoined
that
of
barodia
but
whereas
barodia
was
a
flat
country
euralia
was
a
land
of
hills
it
was
natural
then
that
the
court
geographers
in
search
of
landmarks
should
have
looked
towards
euralia
and
over
euralia
accordingly
about
the
time
when
cottage
and
castle
alike
were
breakfasting
the
king
of
barodia
soared
and
dipped
and
soared
and
dipped
again
a
mother
tender
hand
said
the
king
of
euralia
is
er
never
good
gracious
what
that
there
was
a
sudden
rush
of
air
something
came
for
a
moment
between
his
majesty
and
the
sun
and
then
all
was
quiet
again
what
was
it
asked
hyacinth
slightly
alarmed
most
extraordinary
said
the
king
it
left
in
my
mind
an
impression
of
ginger
whiskers
and
large
boots
do
we
know
anybody
like
that
the
king
of
barodia
said
hyacinth
has
red
whiskers
but
i
know
about
his
boots
but
what
could
he
have
been
doing
up
there
unless
there
was
another
rush
of
wind
in
the
opposite
direction
once
more
the
sun
was
obscured
and
this
time
plain
for
a
moment
for
all
to
see
appeared
the
rapidly
dwindling
back
view
of
the
king
of
barodia
on
his
way
home
to
breakfast
merriwig
rose
with
dignity
you
quite
right
hyacinth
he
said
sternly
it
the
king
of
barodia
hyacinth
looked
troubled
he
ought
to
come
over
anybody
breakfast
table
quite
so
quickly
as
that
ought
he
father
a
lamentable
display
of
manners
my
dear
i
shall
withdraw
now
and
compose
a
stiff
note
to
him
the
amenities
must
be
observed
looking
as
severe
as
a
naturally
jovial
face
would
permit
him
and
wondering
a
little
if
he
had
pronounced
amenities
right
he
strode
to
the
library
the
library
was
his
majesty
favourite
apartment
here
in
the
mornings
he
would
discuss
affairs
of
state
with
his
chancellor
or
receive
any
distinguished
visitors
who
were
to
come
to
his
kingdom
in
search
of
adventure
here
in
the
afternoon
with
a
copy
of
to
say
to
a
or
some
such
book
taken
at
random
from
the
shelves
he
would
give
himself
up
to
meditation
and
it
was
the
distinguished
visitors
of
the
morning
who
gave
him
most
to
think
about
in
the
afternoon
there
were
at
this
moment
no
fewer
than
seven
different
princes
engaged
upon
seven
different
enterprises
to
whom
in
the
event
of
a
successful
conclusion
he
had
promised
the
hand
of
hyacinth
and
half
his
kingdom
no
wonder
he
felt
that
she
needed
the
guiding
hand
of
a
mother
the
stiff
note
to
barodia
was
not
destined
to
be
written
he
was
still
hesitating
between
two
different
kinds
of
nib
when
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
fateful
name
of
the
countess
belvane
was
announced
the
countess
belvane
what
can
i
say
which
will
bring
home
to
you
that
wonderful
terrible
fascinating
woman
mastered
as
she
was
by
overweening
ambition
utterly
unscrupulous
in
her
methods
of
achieving
her
purpose
none
the
less
her
adorable
humanity
betrayed
itself
in
a
passion
for
and
a
devotion
to
the
simpler
forms
of
lyrical
verse
that
she
is
the
villain
of
the
piece
i
know
well
in
his
past
and
the
eminent
historian
roger
scurvilegs
does
not
spare
her
but
that
she
had
her
great
qualities
i
should
be
the
last
to
deny
she
had
been
writing
poetry
that
morning
and
she
wore
green
she
always
wore
green
when
the
muse
was
upon
her
a
pleasing
habit
which
whether
as
a
warning
or
an
inspiration
modern
poets
might
do
well
to
imitate
she
carried
an
enormous
diary
under
her
arm
and
in
her
mind
several
alternative
ways
of
putting
down
her
reflections
on
her
way
to
the
palace
good
morning
dear
countess
said
the
king
rising
only
too
gladly
from
his
nibs
an
early
visit
you
do
mind
your
majesty
said
the
countess
anxiously
there
was
a
point
in
our
conversation
yesterday
about
which
i
was
not
quite
certain
what
we
talking
about
yesterday
oh
your
majesty
said
the
countess
affairs
of
state
and
she
gave
him
that
wicked
innocent
impudent
and
entirely
scandalous
look
which
he
never
could
resist
and
you
could
either
for
that
matter
affairs
of
state
of
course
smiled
the
king
why
i
made
a
special
note
of
it
in
my
diary
she
laid
down
the
enormous
volume
and
turned
lightly
over
the
pages
here
we
are
his
majesty
did
me
the
honour
to
consult
me
about
the
future
of
his
daughter
the
princess
hyacinth
remained
to
tea
and
was
very
i
ca
quite
make
this
word
out
let
look
said
the
king
his
rubicund
face
becoming
yet
more
rubicund
it
looks
like
he
said
casually
fancy
said
belvane
fancy
my
writing
that
i
put
down
just
what
comes
into
my
head
at
the
time
you
know
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
indicative
of
some
one
who
puts
down
just
what
comes
into
her
head
at
the
time
and
returned
to
her
diary
to
tea
and
was
very
charming
mused
afterwards
on
the
mutability
of
life
she
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
i
often
muse
when
i
alone
she
said
the
king
still
hovered
over
the
diary
have
you
any
more
entries
like
like
that
last
one
may
i
look
oh
your
majesty
i
afraid
it
private
she
closed
the
book
quickly
i
just
thought
i
saw
some
poetry
said
the
king
just
a
little
ode
to
a
favourite
linnet
it
would
interest
your
majesty
i
adore
poetry
said
the
king
who
had
himself
written
a
rhymed
couplet
which
could
be
said
either
forwards
or
backwards
and
in
the
latter
position
was
useful
for
removing
enchantments
according
to
the
eminent
historian
roger
scurvilegs
it
had
some
vogue
in
euralia
and
went
like
this
boll
bill
woll
will
a
pleasing
idea
temperately
expressed
the
countess
of
course
was
only
pretending
really
she
was
longing
to
read
it
it
quite
a
little
thing
she
said
to
thee
blithe
linnet
thou
clearly
art
from
bush
or
in
thy
full
heart
leads
the
feathered
choir
in
the
treble
beautiful
said
the
king
and
one
must
agree
with
him
many
years
after
another
poet
called
shelley
plagiarised
the
idea
but
handled
it
in
a
more
artificial
and
to
my
way
of
thinking
decidedly
inferior
manner
was
it
a
real
bird
said
the
king
an
old
favourite
was
it
pleased
about
it
alas
your
majesty
it
died
without
hearing
it
poor
bird
said
his
majesty
i
think
it
would
have
liked
it
meanwhile
hyacinth
innocent
of
the
nearness
of
a
mother
remained
on
the
castle
walls
and
tried
to
get
on
with
her
breakfast
but
she
made
little
progress
with
it
after
all
it
annoying
continually
to
look
up
from
your
bacon
or
whatever
it
is
and
see
a
foreign
monarch
passing
overhead
eighteen
more
times
the
king
of
barodia
took
hyacinth
in
his
stride
at
the
end
of
the
performance
feeling
rather
giddy
she
went
down
to
her
father
she
found
him
alone
in
the
library
a
foolish
smile
upon
his
face
but
no
sign
of
a
letter
to
barodia
in
front
of
him
have
you
sent
the
note
yet
she
asked
note
note
he
said
bewildered
what
oh
you
mean
the
stiff
note
to
the
king
of
barodia
i
just
planning
it
my
love
the
exact
shade
of
stiffness
combined
with
courtesy
is
a
little
difficult
to
hit
i
should
be
too
courteous
said
hyacinth
he
came
over
eighteen
more
times
after
you
gone
eighteen
eighteen
eight
my
dear
it
outrageous
i
never
had
such
a
crowded
breakfast
before
it
positively
insulting
hyacinth
this
is
no
occasion
for
notes
we
will
talk
to
him
in
a
language
that
he
will
understand
and
he
went
out
to
speak
to
the
captain
of
his
archers
chapter
ii
the
chancellor
of
barodia
has
a
long
walk
home
once
more
it
was
early
morning
on
the
castle
walls
the
king
sat
at
his
breakfast
table
a
company
of
archers
drawn
up
in
front
of
him
now
you
all
understand
he
said
when
the
king
of
baro
when
a
certain
well
when
i
say
i
want
you
all
to
fire
your
arrows
into
the
air
you
are
to
take
no
aim
you
are
just
to
shoot
your
arrows
upwards
and
er
i
want
to
see
who
gets
highest
should
anything
er
should
anything
brush
up
against
them
on
their
way
not
of
course
that
it
likely
well
in
that
case
er
in
that
case
something
will
er
brush
up
against
them
after
all
what
quite
so
sire
said
the
captain
or
rather
not
at
all
very
well
to
your
places
each
archer
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
and
took
up
his
position
a
man
had
been
posted
everything
was
ready
the
king
was
decidedly
nervous
he
wandered
from
one
archer
to
another
asking
after
this
man
wife
and
family
praising
the
polish
on
that
man
quiver
or
advising
him
to
stand
with
his
back
a
little
more
to
the
sun
now
and
then
he
would
hurry
off
to
the
man
on
a
distant
turret
point
out
barodia
on
the
horizon
to
him
and
hurry
back
again
the
knew
all
about
it
royalty
over
he
bellowed
suddenly
when
roared
the
king
and
a
cloud
of
arrows
shot
into
the
air
well
done
cried
hyacinth
clapping
her
hands
i
mean
how
could
you
you
might
have
hurt
him
hyacinth
said
the
king
turning
suddenly
you
here
i
have
just
come
up
did
you
hit
him
hit
who
the
king
of
barodia
of
course
the
king
of
my
dear
child
what
could
the
king
of
barodia
be
doing
here
my
archers
were
aiming
at
a
hawk
that
they
saw
in
the
distance
he
beckoned
to
the
captain
did
you
hit
that
hawk
he
asked
with
one
shot
only
sire
in
the
whisk
in
the
tail
feathers
the
king
turned
to
hyacinth
with
one
shot
only
in
the
whisk
in
the
tail
feathers
he
said
what
was
it
my
dear
that
you
were
saying
about
the
king
of
barodia
oh
father
you
are
bad
you
hit
the
poor
man
right
in
the
whisker
his
majesty
of
barodia
and
in
the
whisker
my
dear
child
this
is
terrible
but
what
can
he
have
been
doing
up
there
dear
dear
this
is
really
most
unfortunate
i
must
compose
a
note
of
apology
about
this
i
should
leave
the
first
note
to
him
said
hyacinth
yes
yes
you
right
no
doubt
he
will
wish
to
explain
how
he
came
to
be
there
just
a
moment
dear
he
went
over
to
his
archers
who
were
drawn
up
in
line
again
you
may
take
your
men
down
now
he
said
to
the
captain
yes
your
majesty
his
majesty
looked
quickly
round
the
castle
walls
and
then
leant
confidentially
towards
the
captain
er
which
was
the
man
who
er
he
fingered
his
cheek
er
quite
so
the
one
on
the
left
ah
yes
he
went
to
the
man
on
the
left
and
put
a
bag
of
gold
into
his
hand
you
have
a
very
good
style
with
the
bow
my
man
your
wrist
action
is
excellent
i
have
never
seen
an
arrow
go
so
high
the
company
saluted
and
withdrew
the
king
and
hyacinth
sat
down
to
breakfast
a
little
mullet
my
dear
he
said
the
hereditary
grand
chancellor
of
barodia
never
forgot
that
morning
nor
did
he
allow
his
wife
to
forget
it
his
opening
that
reminds
me
dear
of
the
day
when
though
the
signal
of
departure
for
any
guests
allowed
no
escape
for
his
family
they
had
to
have
it
and
indeed
it
was
a
busy
day
for
him
summoned
to
the
palace
at
nine
he
found
the
king
nursing
a
bent
whisker
and
in
the
very
vilest
of
tempers
his
majesty
was
for
war
at
once
the
chancellor
leant
towards
the
stiff
note
at
least
your
majesty
he
begged
let
me
consult
the
precedents
first
there
is
no
precedent
said
the
king
coldly
for
such
an
outrage
as
this
not
precisely
sire
but
similar
unfortunate
occurrences
have
occurred
it
was
worse
than
an
occurrence
i
should
have
said
an
outrage
your
majesty
your
late
lamented
grandfather
was
unfortunate
enough
to
come
beneath
the
spell
of
the
king
of
araby
under
which
he
was
compelled
or
perhaps
i
should
say
preferred
to
go
about
on
his
hands
and
knees
for
several
weeks
your
majesty
may
recall
how
the
people
in
their
great
loyalty
adopted
a
similar
mode
of
progression
now
although
your
majesty
case
is
not
precisely
on
all
fours
not
at
all
on
all
fours
said
the
king
coldly
an
unfortunate
metaphor
i
should
say
that
although
your
case
is
not
parallel
the
procedure
adopted
in
your
revered
grandfather
case
i
do
care
what
do
with
your
whiskers
i
do
care
what
does
with
his
whiskers
said
the
king
still
soothing
his
own
tenderly
i
want
the
king
of
euralia
blood
he
looked
round
the
court
to
any
one
who
will
bring
me
the
head
of
the
king
i
will
give
the
hand
of
my
daughter
in
marriage
there
was
a
profound
silence
which
daughter
said
a
cautious
voice
at
last
the
eldest
said
the
king
there
was
another
profound
silence
illustration
found
the
king
nursing
a
bent
whisker
and
in
the
very
vilest
of
my
suggestion
your
majesty
said
the
chancellor
is
that
for
the
present
there
should
be
merely
an
exchange
of
stiff
notes
and
that
meanwhile
we
scour
the
kingdom
for
an
enchanter
who
shall
take
some
pleasant
revenge
for
us
upon
his
majesty
of
euralia
for
instance
sire
a
king
whose
head
has
been
permanently
fixed
on
lacks
somewhat
of
that
regal
dignity
which
alone
can
command
the
respect
of
his
subjects
a
couple
of
noses
again
placed
at
different
angles
so
they
can
not
both
be
blown
together
yes
yes
said
the
king
impatiently
think
of
the
things
if
once
you
can
find
the
enchanter
but
they
are
not
so
common
nowadays
besides
enchanters
are
delicate
things
to
work
with
they
have
a
habit
of
forgetting
which
side
they
are
on
the
chancellor
mouth
drooped
piteously
well
said
the
king
condescendingly
i
tell
you
what
we
do
you
may
send
stiff
note
and
then
we
will
declare
war
thank
you
your
majesty
said
the
chancellor
so
the
stiff
note
was
dispatched
it
pointed
out
that
his
majesty
of
barodia
while
in
the
act
of
taking
his
early
morning
constitutional
had
been
severely
insulted
by
an
arrow
this
arrow
though
fortunately
avoiding
the
more
vital
parts
of
his
majesty
person
went
so
far
as
to
wound
a
favourite
whisker
for
this
the
fullest
reparation
must
be
made
and
so
forth
and
so
on
euralia
reply
was
not
long
delayed
it
expressed
the
deepest
concern
at
the
unhappy
accident
which
had
overtaken
a
friendly
monarch
on
the
morning
in
question
his
majesty
had
been
testing
his
archers
in
a
shooting
competition
at
a
distant
hawk
which
competition
it
might
interest
his
majesty
of
barodia
to
know
had
been
won
by
henry
smallnose
a
bowman
of
considerable
promise
in
the
course
of
the
competition
it
was
noticed
that
a
foreign
body
of
some
sort
brushed
up
against
one
of
the
arrows
but
as
this
in
no
way
affected
the
final
placing
of
the
competitors
little
attention
was
paid
to
it
his
majesty
of
barodia
might
rest
assured
that
the
king
had
no
wish
to
pursue
the
matter
farther
indeed
he
was
always
glad
to
welcome
his
barodian
majesty
on
these
occasions
other
shooting
competitions
would
be
arranged
from
time
to
time
and
if
his
majesty
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
moment
the
king
of
euralia
hoped
that
he
would
come
down
and
join
them
trusting
that
her
majesty
and
their
royal
highnesses
were
well
and
so
on
and
so
forth
the
grand
chancellor
of
barodia
read
this
answer
to
his
stiff
note
with
a
growing
feeling
of
uneasiness
it
was
he
who
had
exposed
his
majesty
to
this
fresh
insult
and
unless
he
could
soften
it
in
some
way
his
morning
at
the
palace
might
be
a
painful
one
as
he
entered
the
precincts
he
wondered
whether
the
king
would
be
wearing
the
famous
boots
and
whether
they
kicked
seven
leagues
as
easily
as
they
strode
them
he
felt
more
and
more
that
there
were
notes
which
you
could
break
gently
and
notes
which
you
could
five
minutes
later
as
he
started
on
his
mile
walk
home
he
realised
that
this
was
one
of
the
ones
which
you
could
this
then
was
the
real
reason
of
the
war
between
euralia
and
barodia
i
am
aware
that
in
saying
this
i
differ
from
the
eminent
historian
roger
scurvilegs
in
chapter
ix
of
his
immortal
work
past
and
he
attributes
the
quarrel
between
the
two
countries
to
quite
other
causes
the
king
of
barodia
he
says
demanded
the
hand
of
the
princess
hyacinth
for
his
eldest
son
the
king
of
euralia
made
some
commonplace
condition
as
that
his
royal
highness
should
first
ride
his
horse
up
a
glassy
mountain
in
the
district
a
condition
which
his
majesty
of
barodia
strongly
resented
i
am
afraid
that
roger
is
incurably
romantic
i
have
had
to
speak
to
him
about
it
before
there
was
nothing
of
the
sentimental
in
the
whole
business
and
the
facts
are
exactly
as
i
have
narrated
them
chapter
iii
the
king
of
euralia
draws
his
sword
no
doubt
you
have
already
guessed
that
it
was
the
countess
belvane
who
dictated
the
king
of
euralia
answer
left
to
himself
merriwig
would
have
said
serve
you
jolly
well
right
for
stalking
over
my
kingdom
his
repartee
was
never
very
subtle
hyacinth
would
have
said
of
course
we
sorry
but
a
whisker
is
bad
is
it
and
you
really
to
come
to
breakfast
without
being
asked
the
chancellor
would
have
scratched
his
head
for
a
long
time
and
then
said
referring
to
chap
vii
para
of
the
we
notice
but
belvane
had
her
own
way
of
doing
things
and
if
you
suggest
that
she
wanted
to
make
barodia
declaration
of
war
inevitable
well
the
story
will
show
whether
you
are
right
in
supposing
that
she
had
her
reasons
it
came
a
little
hard
on
the
chancellor
of
barodia
but
the
innocent
must
needs
suffer
for
the
ambitions
of
the
unprincipled
a
maxim
i
borrow
from
past
and
present
roger
in
his
moral
vein
well
said
merriwig
to
the
countess
that
done
it
it
really
is
war
asked
belvane
it
is
hyacinth
is
looking
out
my
armour
at
this
moment
what
did
the
king
of
barodia
say
he
did
anything
he
wrote
a
r
in
red
on
a
dirty
bit
of
paper
pinned
it
to
my
messenger
ear
and
sent
him
back
again
how
very
crude
said
the
countess
oh
i
thought
it
was
er
rather
forcible
said
the
king
awkwardly
secretly
he
had
admired
it
a
good
deal
and
wished
that
he
had
been
the
one
to
do
it
of
course
said
the
countess
with
a
charming
smile
that
sort
of
thing
depends
so
much
on
who
does
it
now
from
your
majesty
it
would
have
seemed
dignified
he
must
have
been
very
angry
said
the
king
picking
up
first
one
and
then
another
of
a
number
of
swords
which
lay
in
front
of
him
i
wish
i
had
seen
his
face
when
he
got
my
note
so
do
i
sighed
the
countess
she
wished
it
much
more
than
the
king
it
is
the
tragedy
of
writing
a
good
letter
that
you
can
not
be
there
when
it
is
opened
a
maxim
of
my
own
the
thought
never
having
occurred
to
roger
scurvilegs
who
was
a
dull
correspondent
the
king
was
still
taking
up
and
putting
down
his
swords
it
very
awkward
he
muttered
i
wonder
if
hyacinth
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
hyacinth
coming
father
called
back
hyacinth
from
a
higher
floor
the
countess
rose
and
curtsied
deeply
good
morning
your
royal
highness
good
morning
countess
said
hyacinth
brightly
she
liked
the
countess
you
could
help
it
but
rather
wished
she
did
oh
hyacinth
said
the
king
come
and
tell
me
about
these
swords
which
is
my
magic
one
hyacinth
looked
at
him
blankly
oh
father
she
said
i
do
know
at
all
does
it
matter
very
much
my
dear
child
of
course
it
matters
supposing
i
am
fighting
the
king
of
barodia
and
i
have
my
magic
sword
then
i
bound
to
win
supposing
i
have
then
i
not
bound
to
supposing
you
both
had
magic
swords
said
belvane
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
say
the
king
looked
up
slowly
at
her
and
began
to
revolve
the
idea
in
his
mind
well
really
he
said
i
had
thought
of
that
upon
my
word
i
he
turned
to
his
daughter
hyacinth
what
would
happen
if
we
both
had
magic
swords
i
suppose
you
go
on
fighting
for
ever
said
hyacinth
or
until
the
magic
wore
out
of
one
of
them
said
belvane
innocently
there
must
be
something
about
it
somewhere
said
the
king
whose
morning
was
in
danger
of
being
quite
spoilt
by
this
new
suggestion
i
ask
the
chancellor
to
look
it
up
only
he
so
busy
just
now
he
have
plenty
of
time
while
the
combat
was
going
on
said
belvane
thoughtfully
wonderful
creature
she
saw
already
the
chancellor
hurrying
up
to
announce
that
the
king
of
euralia
had
won
at
the
very
moment
when
he
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
by
a
mortal
thrust
from
his
adversary
the
king
turned
to
his
swords
again
well
anyway
i
going
to
be
sure
of
he
said
hyacinth
have
you
idea
which
it
is
he
added
in
rather
a
hurt
voice
naturally
i
left
the
marking
of
my
swords
to
his
daughter
examined
the
swords
one
by
one
here
it
is
she
cried
it
got
on
it
for
or
said
the
countess
to
her
diary
the
expression
of
joy
on
the
king
face
at
his
daughter
discovery
had
just
time
to
appear
and
fade
away
again
you
are
not
being
very
helpful
this
morning
countess
he
said
severely
instantly
the
countess
was
on
her
feet
her
diary
thrown
to
the
floor
no
never
thrown
laid
gently
on
the
floor
and
herself
hands
clasped
at
her
breast
a
figure
of
reproachful
penitence
before
him
oh
your
majesty
forgive
me
if
your
majesty
had
only
asked
me
i
did
know
your
majesty
wanted
me
i
thought
her
royal
highness
but
i
find
your
majesty
sword
for
you
did
she
stroke
his
head
as
she
said
this
i
have
often
wondered
it
would
be
like
her
impudence
and
her
motherliness
and
her
in
fact
like
her
past
and
is
silent
upon
the
point
roger
scurvilegs
who
had
only
seen
belvane
at
the
unimpressionable
age
of
two
would
have
had
it
against
her
if
he
could
so
perhaps
there
is
nothing
in
it
there
she
said
and
she
picked
out
the
magic
sword
almost
at
once
illustration
try
it
on
me
cried
the
then
i
get
back
to
my
work
said
hyacinth
cheerfully
and
left
them
to
each
other
the
king
smiling
happily
girded
on
his
sword
but
a
sudden
doubt
assailed
him
are
you
sure
it
the
one
try
it
on
cried
the
countess
superbly
falling
on
her
knees
and
stretching
up
her
arms
to
him
the
toe
of
her
little
shoe
touched
her
diary
its
presence
there
uplifted
her
even
as
she
knelt
she
saw
herself
describing
the
scene
how
do
you
spell
offered
she
wondered
i
think
the
king
was
already
in
love
with
her
though
he
found
it
so
difficult
to
say
the
decisive
words
but
even
so
he
could
only
have
been
in
love
a
week
or
two
a
fortnight
in
the
last
forty
years
and
he
had
worn
a
sword
since
he
was
twelve
in
a
crisis
it
is
the
old
love
and
not
the
greater
love
which
wins
roger
but
i
think
i
agree
with
him
and
instinctively
the
king
drew
his
sword
if
it
were
magic
a
scratch
would
kill
now
he
would
know
her
enemies
said
that
the
countess
could
not
go
pale
she
had
her
faults
but
this
was
not
one
of
them
she
whitened
as
she
saw
the
king
standing
over
her
with
drawn
sword
a
hundred
thoughts
chased
each
other
through
her
mind
she
wondered
if
the
king
would
be
sorry
afterwards
she
wondered
what
the
minstrels
would
sing
of
her
and
if
her
diary
would
ever
be
made
public
most
of
all
she
wondered
why
she
had
been
such
a
fool
such
a
melodramatic
fool
the
king
came
to
himself
with
a
sudden
start
looking
slightly
ashamed
he
put
his
sword
back
in
its
scabbard
coughed
once
or
twice
to
cover
his
confusion
and
held
his
hand
out
to
the
countess
to
assist
her
to
rise
do
be
absurd
countess
he
said
as
if
we
could
spare
you
at
a
time
like
this
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
matters
over
seriously
a
trifle
bewildered
by
the
emotions
she
had
gone
through
belvane
sat
down
the
beloved
diary
clasped
tightly
in
her
arms
life
seemed
singularly
sweet
just
then
the
only
drawback
being
that
the
minstrels
would
not
be
singing
about
her
after
all
still
one
can
not
have
everything
the
king
walked
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
talked
i
am
going
away
to
fight
he
said
and
i
leave
my
dear
daughter
behind
in
my
absence
her
royal
highness
will
of
course
rule
the
country
i
want
her
to
feel
that
she
can
lean
upon
you
countess
for
advice
and
support
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
for
you
have
just
given
me
a
great
proof
of
your
devotion
and
courage
oh
your
majesty
said
belvane
deprecatingly
but
feeling
very
glad
that
it
had
been
wasted
hyacinth
is
young
and
inexperienced
she
needs
a
a
a
mother
guiding
hand
said
belvane
softly
the
king
started
and
looked
away
it
was
really
too
late
to
propose
now
he
had
so
much
to
do
before
the
morrow
better
leave
it
till
he
came
back
from
the
war
you
will
have
no
official
position
he
went
on
hastily
other
than
your
present
one
of
mistress
of
the
robes
but
your
influence
on
her
will
be
very
great
the
countess
had
already
decided
on
this
however
there
a
look
of
modest
resignation
to
an
unsought
duty
which
is
suited
to
an
occasion
of
this
kind
and
the
countess
had
no
difficulty
in
supplying
it
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
your
majesty
to
help
gladly
but
will
not
the
chancellor
the
chancellor
will
come
with
me
he
is
no
fighter
but
he
is
good
at
spells
he
looked
round
to
make
sure
that
they
were
alone
and
then
went
on
confidentially
he
tells
me
that
he
has
discovered
in
the
archives
of
the
palace
a
backward
spell
of
great
value
should
he
be
able
to
cast
this
upon
the
enemy
at
the
first
onslaught
he
thinks
that
our
heroic
army
would
have
no
difficulty
in
advancing
but
there
will
be
other
learned
men
said
belvane
innocently
so
much
more
accustomed
to
affairs
than
us
poor
women
so
much
better
able
what
nonsense
i
talking
she
said
to
herself
to
advise
her
royal
highness
men
like
that
said
the
king
i
shall
want
with
me
also
if
i
am
to
invade
barodia
properly
i
shall
need
every
man
in
the
kingdom
euralia
must
be
for
the
time
a
country
of
women
only
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
and
said
gallantly
that
will
be
er
it
is
er
not
er
one
may
well
er
it
was
so
obvious
from
his
manner
that
something
complimentary
was
struggling
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
that
belvane
felt
it
would
be
kinder
not
to
wait
for
it
oh
your
majesty
she
said
you
flatter
my
poor
sex
not
at
all
said
the
king
trying
to
remember
what
he
had
said
he
held
out
his
hand
well
countess
i
have
much
to
do
i
too
your
majesty
she
made
him
a
deep
curtsey
and
clasping
tightly
the
precious
diary
withdrew
the
king
who
still
seemed
worried
about
something
returned
to
his
table
and
took
up
his
pen
here
hyacinth
discovered
him
ten
minutes
later
his
table
was
covered
with
scraps
of
paper
and
her
eyes
lighting
casually
upon
one
of
them
she
read
these
remarkable
words
such
a
land
i
should
be
a
most
contented
she
looked
at
some
of
the
others
they
were
even
shorter
dear
countess
would
be
my
country
in
which
even
a
king
country
the
last
was
crossed
out
and
written
against
it
whatever
are
these
father
said
hyacinth
the
king
jumped
up
in
great
confusion
nothing
dear
nothing
he
said
i
was
just
er
of
course
i
shall
have
to
address
my
people
and
i
was
just
jotting
down
a
few
however
i
sha
want
them
now
he
swept
them
together
screwed
them
up
tight
and
dropped
them
into
a
basket
and
what
became
of
them
you
ask
did
they
light
the
fires
of
the
palace
next
morning
well
now
here
a
curious
thing
in
chapter
x
of
past
and
i
happened
across
these
words
the
king
and
all
the
men
of
the
land
having
left
to
fight
the
wicked
barodians
euralia
was
now
a
country
of
women
only
country
in
which
even
a
king
might
be
glad
to
be
a
now
what
does
this
mean
is
it
another
example
of
literary
theft
i
have
already
had
to
expose
shelley
must
i
now
drag
into
the
light
of
day
a
still
worse
plagiarism
by
roger
scurvilegs
the
baskets
of
the
palace
were
no
doubt
open
to
him
as
to
so
many
historians
but
should
he
not
have
made
acknowledgments
i
do
not
wish
to
be
hard
on
roger
that
i
differ
from
him
on
many
points
of
historical
fact
has
already
been
made
plain
and
will
be
made
still
more
plain
as
my
story
goes
on
but
i
have
a
respect
for
the
man
and
on
some
matters
particularly
those
concerning
prince
udo
of
araby
first
appearance
in
euralia
i
have
to
rely
entirely
upon
him
for
my
information
moreover
i
have
never
hesitated
to
give
him
credit
for
such
of
his
epigrams
as
i
have
introduced
into
this
book
and
i
like
to
think
that
he
would
be
equally
punctilious
to
others
we
know
his
romantic
way
no
doubt
the
thought
occurred
to
him
independently
let
us
put
it
at
that
anyhow
belvane
meanwhile
was
getting
on
the
king
had
drawn
his
sword
on
her
and
she
had
not
flinched
as
a
reward
she
was
to
be
the
power
behind
the
throne
not
necessarily
the
throne
said
belvane
to
herself
chapter
iv
the
princess
hyacinth
leaves
it
to
the
countess
it
is
now
time
to
introduce
wiggs
to
you
and
i
find
myself
in
a
difficulty
at
once
what
wiggs
position
in
the
palace
this
story
is
hard
to
tell
for
i
have
to
piece
it
together
from
the
narratives
of
others
and
to
supply
any
gaps
in
their
stories
from
my
knowledge
of
how
the
different
characters
might
be
expected
to
act
perhaps
therefore
it
is
a
good
moment
in
which
to
introduce
to
you
the
authorities
upon
whom
i
rely
first
and
foremost
of
course
comes
roger
scurvilegs
his
monumental
work
past
and
in
seventeen
volumes
towers
upon
my
desk
as
i
write
by
the
merest
chance
i
picked
it
up
in
a
metaphorical
sense
at
that
little
shop
near
i
forget
its
name
but
it
the
third
bookshop
on
the
left
as
you
come
into
london
from
the
new
barnet
end
upon
him
i
depend
for
the
broad
lines
of
my
story
and
i
have
already
indicated
my
opinion
of
the
value
of
his
work
secondly
come
the
many
legends
and
ballads
handed
on
to
me
years
ago
by
my
aunt
by
marriage
one
of
the
cornish
smallnoses
she
claims
to
be
a
direct
descendant
of
that
henry
smallnose
whose
lucky
shot
brought
about
the
events
which
i
am
to
describe
i
say
she
claims
to
be
and
one
can
not
doubt
a
lady
word
in
these
matters
certainly
she
used
to
speak
about
henry
with
that
mixture
of
pride
and
extreme
familiarity
which
comes
best
from
a
relation
in
all
matters
not
touching
henry
i
feel
that
i
can
rely
upon
her
in
its
main
lines
her
narrative
is
strictly
confirmed
by
scurvilegs
and
she
brought
to
it
a
picturesqueness
and
an
appreciation
of
the
true
character
of
belvane
which
is
lacking
in
the
other
but
her
attitude
towards
henry
smallnose
was
absurd
indeed
she
would
have
had
him
the
hero
of
the
story
this
makes
roger
and
myself
smile
we
give
him
credit
for
the
first
shot
and
then
we
drop
him
thirdly
belvane
herself
women
like
belvane
never
die
and
i
met
her
or
a
reincarnation
of
her
at
a
country
house
in
shropshire
last
summer
i
forget
what
she
calls
herself
now
but
i
recognised
her
at
once
and
as
i
watched
her
the
centuries
rolled
away
and
she
and
i
were
in
euralia
that
pleasant
country
together
stayed
to
tea
and
was
very
charming
would
she
have
said
that
of
me
i
wonder
but
i
getting
sentimental
roger
great
fault
these
then
are
my
authorities
i
consult
them
and
i
ask
myself
what
was
wiggs
roger
speaks
of
her
simply
as
an
attendant
upon
the
princess
now
we
know
that
the
princess
was
seventeen
wiggs
then
would
be
about
the
same
age
a
perhaps
even
a
little
older
why
not
you
say
the
lady
wiggs
to
her
royal
highness
the
princess
hyacinth
eighteen
and
a
bit
tall
and
stately
since
she
is
to
endanger
belvane
plans
let
her
be
something
of
a
match
for
the
wicked
woman
yes
but
you
would
never
talk
like
that
if
you
had
heard
one
of
my
aunt
stories
nor
if
you
had
seen
belvane
would
you
think
that
any
woman
could
be
a
match
for
her
wiggs
was
a
child
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
in
all
the
legends
and
ballads
handed
down
to
me
by
my
aunt
she
appears
to
me
as
a
little
girl
alice
in
a
fairy
story
roger
or
no
roger
i
must
have
her
a
child
and
even
roger
can
not
keep
up
the
farce
that
she
is
a
real
in
one
place
he
tells
us
that
she
dusts
the
throne
of
the
princess
can
you
see
her
ladyship
eighteen
last
february
doing
that
at
other
times
he
allows
her
to
take
orders
from
the
countess
i
ask
you
to
imagine
a
taking
orders
from
any
but
her
own
mistress
conceive
her
dignity
a
little
friend
then
of
hyacinth
let
us
say
ready
to
do
anything
for
anybody
who
loved
or
appeared
to
love
her
mistress
the
king
had
departed
for
the
wars
his
magic
sword
girded
to
his
side
his
cloak
of
darkness
not
worn
but
rolled
up
behind
him
lest
the
absence
of
his
usual
extensive
shadow
should
disturb
his
horse
he
rode
at
the
head
of
his
men
to
meet
the
enemy
hyacinth
had
seen
him
off
from
the
palace
steps
five
times
he
had
come
back
to
give
her
his
last
instructions
and
a
sixth
time
for
his
sword
but
now
he
was
gone
and
she
was
alone
on
the
castle
walls
with
wiggs
saying
to
fathers
is
very
tiring
said
hyacinth
i
do
hope
he
be
all
right
wiggs
although
we
ought
to
mention
it
to
anybody
and
although
he
only
just
gone
we
do
think
it
will
be
rather
fun
being
queen
do
we
it
must
be
lovely
said
wiggs
gazing
at
her
with
large
eyes
can
you
really
do
whatever
you
like
now
hyacinth
nodded
i
always
whatever
i
liked
she
said
but
now
i
really
do
it
could
you
cut
anybody
head
off
easily
said
the
princess
confidently
i
should
hate
to
cut
anybody
head
off
so
should
i
wiggs
let
decide
to
have
no
heads
off
just
at
present
till
we
more
used
to
it
wiggs
still
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
princess
which
is
stronger
she
asked
you
or
a
fairy
i
knew
you
were
going
to
ask
something
horrid
like
that
said
hyacinth
pretending
to
be
angry
she
looked
quickly
round
to
see
that
nobody
was
listening
and
then
whispered
in
wiggs
ear
i
am
o
oh
said
wiggs
how
lovely
is
it
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
father
and
the
fairy
his
majesty
his
majesty
the
king
of
euralia
it
happened
in
the
forest
one
day
just
after
he
became
king
did
ever
hear
the
story
i
expect
not
well
then
you
must
hear
it
but
there
will
be
too
many
inverted
commas
in
it
if
i
let
hyacinth
tell
you
so
i
shall
tell
you
myself
illustration
times
he
had
come
back
to
give
her
his
last
it
was
just
after
he
became
king
he
was
so
proud
that
he
used
to
go
about
saying
i
am
the
king
i
am
the
king
and
sometimes
the
king
am
i
the
king
i
am
he
was
saying
this
one
day
in
the
forest
when
a
fairy
overheard
him
so
she
appeared
in
front
of
him
and
said
i
believe
you
are
the
king
i
am
the
king
said
merriwig
i
am
the
king
i
am
the
and
yet
said
the
fairy
what
is
a
king
after
all
it
is
a
very
powerful
thing
to
be
a
king
said
merriwig
proudly
supposing
i
were
to
turn
you
into
a
a
small
sheep
then
where
would
you
be
the
king
thought
anxiously
for
a
moment
i
should
like
to
be
a
small
sheep
he
said
the
fairy
waved
her
wand
then
you
can
be
one
she
said
until
you
own
that
a
fairy
is
much
more
powerful
than
a
king
so
all
at
once
he
was
a
small
sheep
well
said
the
fairy
well
said
the
king
which
is
more
powerful
a
king
or
a
fairy
a
king
said
merriwig
besides
being
more
woolly
he
added
there
was
silence
for
a
little
merriwig
began
to
eat
some
grass
i
do
think
much
of
fairies
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
i
do
think
they
very
powerful
the
fairy
looked
at
him
angrily
they
ca
make
you
say
things
you
do
want
to
say
he
explained
the
fairy
stamped
her
foot
be
a
toad
she
said
waving
her
wand
a
nasty
horrid
crawling
toad
i
wanted
began
merriwig
to
be
a
toad
he
ended
from
lower
down
well
said
the
fairy
i
do
think
much
of
fairies
said
the
king
i
do
think
they
very
powerful
he
waited
for
the
fairy
to
look
at
him
but
she
pretended
to
be
thinking
of
something
else
after
waiting
a
minute
or
two
he
added
they
ca
make
you
say
things
you
want
to
say
the
fairy
stamped
her
foot
still
more
angrily
and
moved
her
wand
a
third
time
be
silent
she
commanded
and
stay
silent
for
ever
there
was
no
sound
in
the
forest
the
fairy
looked
at
the
blue
sky
through
the
green
roof
above
her
she
looked
through
the
tall
trunks
of
the
trees
to
the
king
castle
beyond
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
little
glade
on
her
left
upon
the
mossy
bank
on
her
right
but
she
would
not
look
down
to
the
toad
at
her
feet
no
she
would
she
and
yet
it
was
too
much
for
her
she
could
resist
no
longer
she
looked
at
the
nasty
horrid
crawling
toad
the
dumb
toad
at
her
feet
that
was
once
a
king
and
catching
her
eye
the
toad
some
winks
are
more
expressive
than
others
the
fairy
knew
quite
well
what
this
one
meant
it
meant
i
do
think
much
of
fairies
i
do
think
they
very
powerful
they
ca
make
you
say
things
you
do
want
to
say
the
fairy
waved
her
wand
in
disgust
oh
be
a
king
again
she
said
impatiently
and
vanished
and
so
that
is
the
story
of
how
the
king
of
euralia
met
the
fairy
in
the
forest
roger
scurvilegs
tells
it
well
indeed
almost
as
well
as
i
do
but
he
burdens
it
with
a
moral
you
must
think
it
out
for
yourself
i
shall
not
give
it
to
you
wiggs
did
bother
about
the
moral
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
she
gazed
at
the
forest
and
imagined
the
scene
to
herself
how
wonderful
to
be
a
king
like
that
she
thought
that
was
a
long
time
ago
explained
hyacinth
father
must
have
been
rather
lovely
in
those
days
she
added
it
was
a
very
bad
fairy
said
wiggs
it
was
a
very
stupid
one
i
would
have
given
in
to
father
like
that
but
there
are
good
fairies
are
there
i
met
one
once
you
child
where
i
do
know
if
it
would
have
made
any
difference
to
euralian
history
if
wiggs
had
been
allowed
to
tell
about
her
fairy
then
as
it
was
she
did
tell
the
story
till
later
on
when
belvane
happened
to
be
near
i
regret
to
say
that
belvane
listened
it
was
the
sort
of
story
that
got
overheard
she
explained
afterwards
as
if
that
were
any
excuse
on
this
occasion
she
was
just
too
early
to
overhear
but
in
time
to
prevent
the
story
being
told
without
her
the
countess
belvane
said
an
attendant
and
her
ladyship
made
a
superb
entry
good
morning
countess
said
hyacinth
good
morning
your
royal
highness
ah
wiggs
sweet
child
she
added
carelessly
putting
out
a
hand
to
pat
the
sweet
child
head
but
missing
it
wiggs
was
just
telling
me
a
story
said
the
princess
sweet
child
said
belvane
feeling
vaguely
for
her
with
the
other
hand
i
interrupt
the
story
with
a
little
business
your
royal
highness
at
a
nod
from
the
princess
wiggs
withdrew
well
said
hyacinth
nervously
belvane
had
always
a
curious
effect
on
the
princess
when
they
were
alone
together
there
was
something
about
her
large
manner
which
made
hyacinth
feel
like
a
schoolgirl
who
has
been
behaving
badly
alarmed
and
apologetic
i
feel
like
this
myself
when
i
have
an
interview
with
my
publishers
and
roger
scurvilegs
upon
the
same
subject
drags
in
a
certain
uncle
of
his
before
whom
so
he
says
he
always
appears
at
his
worst
it
is
a
common
experience
just
one
or
two
little
schemes
to
submit
to
your
majesty
said
the
countess
how
silly
of
me
i
mean
your
royal
highness
of
course
your
royal
highness
may
not
like
them
at
all
but
in
case
your
royal
highness
did
i
just
well
i
just
wrote
them
out
she
unfolded
one
by
one
a
series
of
ornamental
parchments
they
are
beautifully
written
said
the
princess
belvane
blushed
at
the
compliment
she
had
a
passion
for
coloured
inks
and
rulers
in
her
diary
the
day
of
the
week
was
always
underlined
in
red
the
important
words
in
the
day
doings
being
frequently
picked
out
in
gold
on
taking
up
the
diary
you
saw
at
once
that
you
were
in
the
presence
of
somebody
the
first
parchment
was
headed
scheme
for
economy
in
realm
economy
caught
the
eye
in
pale
pink
the
next
parchment
was
headed
scheme
for
safety
of
realm
safety
clamoured
to
you
in
blue
the
third
parchment
was
headed
scheme
for
encouragement
of
literature
in
realm
encouragement
of
literature
had
got
rather
cramped
in
the
small
quarters
available
for
it
a
heading
belvane
felt
should
be
in
one
line
she
had
started
in
letters
too
big
for
it
and
the
fact
that
the
green
ink
was
giving
out
made
it
impossible
to
start
afresh
there
were
ten
parchments
altogether
by
the
end
of
the
third
one
the
princess
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
by
the
end
of
the
fifth
one
she
knew
that
it
was
a
mistake
her
ever
having
come
into
the
royal
family
at
all
by
the
end
of
the
seventh
she
decided
that
if
the
countess
would
forgive
her
this
time
she
would
never
be
naughty
again
by
the
end
of
the
ninth
one
she
was
just
going
to
cry
the
tenth
one
was
in
a
very
loud
orange
and
was
headed
scheme
for
assisting
calisthenics
in
realm
yes
said
the
princess
faintly
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
i
thought
if
your
royal
highness
approved
said
belvane
we
might
just
hyacinth
felt
herself
blushing
guiltily
she
could
think
why
i
leave
it
to
you
countess
she
murmured
i
am
sure
you
know
best
it
was
a
remark
which
she
would
never
have
made
to
her
father
chapter
v
belvane
indulges
her
hobby
in
a
glade
in
the
forest
the
countess
belvane
was
sitting
her
throne
a
fallen
log
her
courtiers
that
imaginary
audience
which
was
always
with
her
for
once
in
her
life
she
was
nervous
she
had
an
anxious
morning
in
front
of
her
i
can
tell
you
the
reason
at
once
her
royal
highness
was
going
to
review
her
royal
highness
army
of
amazons
see
ii
safety
of
in
half
an
hour
she
would
be
here
and
why
not
you
say
could
anything
be
more
gratifying
i
will
tell
you
why
not
there
was
no
army
of
amazons
in
order
that
her
royal
highness
should
not
know
the
sad
truth
belvane
drew
their
pay
for
them
was
better
thus
in
any
trouble
belvane
comforted
herself
by
reading
up
her
diary
she
undid
the
enormous
volume
and
idly
turning
the
pages
read
some
of
the
more
delightful
extracts
to
herself
june
she
read
became
bad
she
gave
a
sigh
of
resignation
to
the
necessity
of
being
bad
roger
scurvilegs
is
of
the
opinion
that
she
might
have
sighed
a
good
many
years
before
according
to
him
she
was
born
bad
june
she
read
on
realised
in
the
privacy
of
my
heart
that
i
was
destined
to
rule
the
country
june
decided
to
oust
the
princess
june
began
ousting
what
a
confession
for
any
woman
even
for
one
who
had
become
bad
last
monday
no
wonder
belvane
diary
was
not
for
everybody
let
us
look
over
her
shoulder
and
read
some
more
of
the
wicked
confessions
june
made
myself
a
oh
that
quite
private
however
we
may
read
this
for
the
beware
lest
you
should
tumble
down
in
reaching
for
another
crown
an
admirable
sentiment
which
roger
scurvilegs
would
have
approved
although
he
could
not
have
rhymed
it
so
neatly
the
countess
turned
on
a
few
more
pages
and
prepared
to
write
up
yesterday
events
june
she
said
to
herself
now
what
happened
acclaimed
with
enthusiasm
outside
the
palace
how
do
you
spell
she
bit
the
end
of
her
pencil
and
pondered
she
turned
back
the
pages
till
she
came
to
the
place
yes
she
said
thoughtfully
it
had
three
last
time
so
turn
she
wrote
enthuzziazm
lightly
in
pencil
later
on
it
would
be
picked
out
in
gold
she
closed
the
diary
hastily
somebody
was
coming
it
was
wiggs
oh
if
you
please
your
ladyship
her
royal
highness
sent
me
to
tell
you
that
she
would
be
here
at
eleven
to
review
her
new
army
it
was
the
last
thing
of
which
belvane
wanted
reminding
ah
wiggs
sweet
child
she
said
you
find
me
overwhelmed
she
gave
a
tragic
sigh
leader
of
the
corps
de
ballet
she
indicated
with
her
toe
how
this
was
done
of
the
army
of
amazons
here
she
saluted
and
it
was
certainly
the
least
she
could
do
for
the
money
warden
of
the
antimacassars
and
grand
mistress
of
the
robes
i
have
a
busy
life
just
come
and
dust
this
log
for
her
royal
highness
all
this
work
wears
me
out
wiggs
but
it
is
my
duty
and
i
do
it
woggs
says
you
make
a
very
good
thing
out
of
it
said
wiggs
innocently
as
she
began
to
dust
it
must
be
nice
to
make
very
good
things
out
of
things
the
countess
looked
coldly
at
her
it
is
one
thing
to
confide
to
your
diary
that
you
are
bad
it
quite
another
to
have
woggsseses
shouting
it
out
all
over
the
country
i
do
know
what
woggs
is
said
belvane
sternly
but
send
it
to
me
at
once
as
soon
as
wiggs
was
gone
belvane
gave
herself
up
to
her
passions
she
strode
up
and
down
the
velvety
sward
saying
to
herself
bother
bother
bother
bother
her
outbreak
of
violence
over
she
sat
gloomily
down
on
the
log
and
abandoned
herself
to
despair
her
hair
fell
in
two
plaits
down
her
back
to
her
waist
on
second
thoughts
she
arranged
them
in
front
if
one
is
going
to
despair
one
may
as
well
do
it
to
the
best
advantage
suddenly
a
thought
struck
her
i
am
alone
she
said
dare
i
soliloquise
i
will
it
is
a
thing
i
have
not
done
for
weeks
what
a
she
got
up
quickly
could
soliloquise
on
a
log
like
that
she
said
crossly
she
decided
she
could
do
it
just
as
effectively
when
standing
with
one
pale
hand
raised
to
the
skies
she
began
again
oh
what
a
did
you
call
me
mum
said
woggs
appearing
suddenly
said
belvane
she
gave
a
shrug
of
resignation
another
time
she
told
herself
she
turned
to
woggs
woggs
must
have
been
quite
close
at
hand
to
have
been
found
by
wiggs
so
quickly
and
i
suspect
her
of
playing
in
the
forest
when
she
ought
to
have
been
doing
her
lessons
or
mending
stockings
or
whatever
made
up
her
day
work
woggs
i
find
nearly
as
difficult
to
explain
as
wiggs
it
is
a
terrible
thing
for
an
author
to
have
a
lot
of
people
running
about
his
book
without
any
invitation
from
him
at
all
however
since
woggs
is
there
we
must
make
the
best
of
her
i
fancy
that
she
was
a
year
or
two
younger
than
wiggs
and
of
rather
inferior
education
witness
her
low
innuendo
about
the
lady
belvane
and
the
fact
that
she
called
a
countess
mum
come
here
said
belvane
are
you
what
they
call
woggs
please
mum
said
woggs
nervously
the
countess
winced
at
the
mum
but
went
on
bravely
what
have
you
been
saying
about
me
n
nothing
mum
belvane
winced
again
and
said
do
you
know
what
i
do
to
little
girls
who
say
things
about
me
i
cut
their
heads
off
i
she
tried
to
think
of
something
very
alarming
i
i
stop
their
jam
for
tea
i
i
am
annoyed
with
them
woggs
suddenly
saw
what
a
wicked
thing
she
had
done
oh
please
mum
she
said
brokenly
and
fell
on
her
knees
call
me
burst
out
belvane
it
so
why
do
you
suppose
i
ever
wanted
to
be
a
countess
at
all
woggs
if
it
so
as
not
to
be
called
any
more
i
do
know
mum
said
woggs
belvane
gave
it
up
the
whole
morning
was
going
wrong
anyhow
come
here
child
she
sighed
and
listen
you
have
been
a
very
naughty
girl
but
i
going
to
let
you
off
this
time
and
in
return
i
something
you
are
going
to
do
for
me
yes
mum
said
woggs
belvane
barely
shuddered
now
a
sudden
brilliant
plan
had
come
to
her
her
royal
highness
is
about
to
review
her
army
of
amazons
it
is
a
sudden
idea
of
her
royal
highness
and
it
comes
at
an
unfortunate
moment
for
it
so
happens
that
the
army
is
er
was
the
army
doing
ah
yes
manoeuvring
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
but
we
must
not
disappoint
her
royal
highness
what
then
shall
we
do
woggs
i
do
know
mum
said
woggs
stolidly
not
having
expected
any
real
assistance
from
her
the
countess
went
on
i
will
tell
you
you
see
yonder
tree
armed
to
the
teeth
will
march
round
and
round
it
giving
the
impression
to
one
on
this
side
of
a
large
army
passing
for
this
you
will
be
rewarded
here
is
she
felt
in
the
bag
she
carried
no
on
second
thoughts
i
will
owe
it
to
you
now
you
quite
understand
yes
mum
said
woggs
very
well
then
run
along
to
the
palace
and
get
a
sword
and
a
helmet
and
a
bow
and
an
arrow
and
an
an
arrow
and
anything
you
like
and
then
come
back
here
and
wait
behind
those
bushes
when
i
clap
my
hands
the
army
will
begin
to
march
woggs
curtsied
and
ran
off
it
is
probable
that
at
this
point
the
countess
would
have
resumed
her
soliloquy
but
we
shall
never
know
for
the
next
moment
the
princess
and
her
court
were
seen
approaching
from
the
other
end
of
the
glade
belvane
advanced
to
meet
them
good
morning
your
royal
highness
she
said
a
beautiful
day
is
it
not
beautiful
countess
with
the
court
at
her
back
hyacinth
for
the
moment
was
less
nervous
than
usual
but
almost
at
the
first
words
of
the
countess
she
felt
her
oozing
from
her
did
i
say
i
was
like
this
with
my
publishers
and
roger
uncle
one
ca
explain
it
the
court
stood
about
in
picturesque
attitudes
while
belvane
went
on
your
royal
highness
brave
women
defenders
the
home
defence
army
of
amazons
here
she
saluted
one
soon
gets
into
the
knack
of
it
and
it
gives
an
air
of
efficiency
have
looked
forward
to
this
day
for
weeks
how
their
hearts
fill
with
pride
at
the
thought
of
being
reviewed
by
your
royal
highness
she
had
paid
or
rather
received
the
money
for
the
army
so
often
that
she
had
quite
got
to
believe
in
its
existence
she
even
kept
a
roll
of
the
different
companies
it
meant
more
delightful
red
ink
for
one
thing
and
wrote
herself
little
notes
recommending
corporal
gretal
hottshott
for
promotion
to
sergeant
i
know
very
little
about
armies
i
afraid
said
hyacinth
always
left
that
to
my
father
but
i
think
it
a
sweet
idea
of
yours
to
enrol
the
women
to
defend
me
it
a
little
expensive
is
it
not
your
royal
highness
armies
are
expensive
the
princess
took
her
seat
and
beckoned
wiggs
with
a
smile
to
her
side
the
court
in
attitudes
even
more
picturesque
than
before
grouped
itself
behind
her
is
your
royal
highness
ready
quite
ready
countess
the
countess
clapped
her
hands
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
and
then
armed
to
the
teeth
amazon
after
amazon
marched
by
an
impressive
scene
however
wiggs
must
needs
try
to
spoil
it
why
it
woggs
she
cried
silly
child
said
belvane
in
an
undertone
giving
her
a
push
the
princess
looked
round
inquiringly
the
absurd
creature
explained
the
countess
thought
she
recognized
a
friend
in
your
royal
highness
gallant
army
how
clever
of
her
they
all
look
exactly
alike
to
belvane
was
equal
to
the
occasion
the
uniform
and
discipline
of
an
army
have
that
effect
rather
she
said
it
has
often
been
noticed
i
suppose
so
said
the
princess
vaguely
ought
they
to
march
in
fours
i
seem
to
remember
when
i
came
to
reviews
with
father
ah
your
royal
highness
that
was
an
army
of
men
with
women
well
we
found
that
if
they
marched
side
by
side
they
talk
all
the
time
the
court
which
had
been
resting
on
the
right
leg
with
the
left
knee
bent
now
rested
on
the
left
leg
with
the
right
knee
bent
woggs
also
was
getting
tired
the
last
company
of
the
army
of
amazons
was
not
marching
with
the
abandon
of
the
first
company
illustration
to
the
teeth
amazon
after
amazon
marched
i
think
i
should
like
them
to
halt
now
so
that
i
can
address
them
said
hyacinth
belvane
was
taken
aback
for
the
moment
i
am
afraid
your
your
royal
highness
she
stammered
her
brain
working
busily
all
the
time
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
to
to
the
spirit
of
er
the
king
regulations
an
army
an
army
in
marching
order
must
er
she
made
a
long
forward
movement
with
her
hand
must
march
she
repeated
with
an
innocent
smile
i
see
said
hyacinth
blushing
guiltily
again
belvane
gave
a
loud
cough
the
last
veteran
but
two
of
the
army
looked
inquiringly
at
her
and
passed
the
last
veteran
but
one
came
in
and
was
greeted
with
a
still
louder
cough
rather
tentatively
the
last
veteran
of
all
entered
and
met
such
an
unmistakable
frown
that
it
was
obvious
that
the
was
over
woggs
took
off
her
helmet
and
rested
in
the
bushes
that
is
all
your
royal
highness
said
belvane
marches
past
reported
sick
making
are
on
guard
at
the
palace
and
make
add
under
age
and
we
bring
it
up
to
the
round
thousand
wiggs
opened
her
mouth
to
say
something
but
decided
that
her
mistress
would
probably
wish
to
say
it
instead
hyacinth
however
merely
looked
unhappy
belvane
came
a
little
nearer
i
er
forgot
if
i
mentioned
to
your
royal
highness
that
we
are
paying
out
today
one
silver
piece
a
day
and
several
days
in
the
week
multiplied
by
how
many
did
i
say
comes
to
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
she
produced
a
document
beautifully
ruled
if
your
royal
highness
would
kindly
initial
here
mechanically
the
princess
signed
thank
you
your
royal
highness
and
now
perhaps
i
had
better
go
and
see
about
it
at
once
she
curtsied
deeply
and
then
remembering
her
position
saluted
and
marched
off
now
roger
scurvilegs
would
see
her
go
without
a
pang
he
would
then
turn
over
to
his
next
chapter
beginning
meanwhile
the
king
and
leave
you
under
the
impression
that
the
countess
belvane
was
a
common
thief
i
am
no
such
chronicler
as
that
at
all
costs
i
will
be
fair
to
my
characters
belvane
then
had
a
weakness
she
had
several
of
which
i
have
already
told
you
but
this
is
another
one
she
had
a
passion
for
the
distribution
of
largesse
i
know
an
old
gentleman
who
plays
bowls
every
evening
he
trundles
his
skip
or
whatever
he
calls
it
to
one
end
of
the
green
toddles
after
it
and
trundles
it
back
again
think
of
him
for
a
moment
and
then
think
of
belvane
on
her
palfrey
tossing
a
bag
of
gold
to
right
of
her
and
flinging
a
bag
of
gold
to
left
of
her
as
she
rides
through
the
cheering
crowds
upon
my
word
i
think
hers
is
the
more
admirable
exercise
and
i
assure
you
no
less
exacting
when
once
one
has
got
into
this
habit
of
flinging
or
tossing
money
to
give
it
in
any
ordinary
way
to
slide
it
gently
into
the
palm
is
unbearable
which
of
us
who
has
in
an
heroic
moment
flung
half
a
crown
to
a
cabman
can
ever
be
content
afterwards
to
hold
out
a
handful
of
bits
and
coppers
to
him
one
must
always
be
flinging
so
it
was
with
belvane
the
largesse
habit
had
got
hold
of
her
it
is
an
expensive
habit
but
her
way
of
doing
it
was
less
expensive
than
most
the
people
were
taxed
to
pay
for
the
amazon
army
the
pay
of
the
amazon
army
was
flung
back
at
them
could
anything
be
fairer
true
it
brought
her
admiration
and
applause
but
what
woman
does
not
like
admiration
is
that
an
offence
if
it
is
it
is
something
very
different
from
the
common
theft
of
which
roger
scurvilegs
would
accuse
her
let
us
be
fair
chapter
vi
there
are
no
wizards
in
barodia
meanwhile
the
king
of
euralia
was
prosecuting
the
war
with
utmost
vigour
so
says
roger
in
that
famous
chapter
of
his
and
certainly
merriwig
was
very
busy
on
the
declaration
of
war
the
euralian
forces
in
accordance
with
custom
had
marched
into
barodia
however
hot
ran
the
passion
between
them
the
two
kings
always
preserved
the
elementary
courtesies
of
war
the
last
battle
had
taken
place
in
euralian
territory
this
time
therefore
barodia
was
the
scene
of
the
conflict
to
barodia
then
king
merriwig
had
led
his
army
suitable
pasture
land
had
been
allotted
them
as
a
camping
ground
and
amid
the
cheers
of
the
barodian
populace
the
euralians
made
their
simple
preparations
for
the
night
the
two
armies
had
now
been
sitting
opposite
to
each
other
for
some
weeks
but
neither
side
had
been
idle
on
the
very
first
morning
merriwig
had
put
on
his
cloak
of
darkness
and
gone
to
the
enemy
camp
to
explore
the
situation
unfortunately
the
same
idea
had
occurred
at
the
same
moment
to
the
king
of
barodia
he
also
had
his
cloak
of
darkness
half
way
across
to
the
utmost
astonishment
of
both
the
two
kings
had
come
violently
into
contact
realising
that
they
had
met
some
unprecedented
enchantment
they
had
hurried
home
after
the
recoil
to
consult
their
respective
chancellors
the
chancellors
could
make
nothing
of
it
they
could
only
advise
their
majesties
to
venture
another
attempt
on
the
following
morning
but
by
a
different
route
said
the
chancellors
whereby
the
magic
pillar
shall
be
avoided
so
by
the
more
southerly
path
the
two
kings
ventured
out
next
morning
half
way
across
there
was
another
violent
collision
and
both
kings
sat
down
suddenly
to
think
it
out
wonder
of
wonders
said
merriwig
there
is
a
magic
wall
stretching
between
the
two
armies
he
stood
up
and
holding
up
his
hand
said
impressively
boll
bill
woll
mystery
of
mysteries
cried
the
king
of
barodia
it
can
he
stopped
suddenly
both
kings
coughed
they
were
remembering
with
some
shame
their
fright
of
yesterday
who
are
you
said
the
king
of
barodia
merriwig
saw
that
there
was
need
to
dissemble
his
majesty
swineherd
he
said
in
what
he
imagined
might
be
a
swineherd
voice
er
so
am
i
said
the
king
of
barodia
rather
feebly
there
was
obviously
nothing
for
it
but
for
them
to
discuss
swine
merriwig
was
comfortably
ignorant
of
the
subject
the
king
of
barodia
knew
rather
less
than
that
er
how
many
have
you
asked
the
latter
seven
thousand
said
merriwig
at
random
er
so
have
i
said
the
king
of
barodia
still
more
feebly
couples
explained
merriwig
mine
are
ones
said
the
king
of
barodia
determined
to
be
independent
at
last
each
king
was
surprised
to
find
how
easy
it
was
to
talk
to
an
expert
on
his
own
subject
the
king
of
barodia
indeed
began
to
feel
reckless
well
he
said
i
must
be
getting
back
it
er
milking
time
so
must
i
said
merriwig
by
the
way
he
added
what
do
you
feed
yours
on
the
king
of
barodia
was
not
quite
sure
if
it
was
apple
sauce
or
not
he
decided
that
perhaps
it
was
that
a
secret
he
said
darkly
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
merriwig
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
to
this
than
ah
he
said
it
very
impressively
and
with
a
word
of
farewell
returned
to
his
camp
he
was
in
brilliant
form
over
the
wassail
bowl
that
night
as
he
drew
a
picture
of
his
triumphant
dissimulation
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
the
king
of
barodia
was
in
brilliant
form
too
for
several
weeks
after
this
the
battle
raged
sometimes
the
whole
euralian
army
would
line
up
outside
its
camp
and
call
upon
the
barodians
to
fight
at
other
times
the
barodian
army
would
form
fours
in
full
view
of
the
euralians
in
the
hope
of
provoking
a
conflict
at
intervals
the
two
chancellors
would
look
up
old
spells
scour
the
country
for
wizards
or
send
each
other
insulting
messages
at
the
end
of
a
month
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
side
had
obtained
the
advantage
a
little
hill
surmounted
by
a
single
tree
lay
half
way
between
the
two
camps
thither
one
fine
morning
came
the
two
kings
and
the
two
chancellors
on
bloody
business
bent
the
phrase
is
roger
their
object
was
nothing
less
than
to
arrange
that
personal
fight
between
the
two
monarchs
which
was
always
a
feature
of
warfare
the
two
kings
having
shaken
hands
their
chancellors
proceeded
to
settle
the
details
i
suppose
said
the
chancellor
of
barodia
that
your
majesties
will
wish
to
fight
with
swords
certainly
said
the
king
of
barodia
promptly
so
promptly
that
merriwig
felt
certain
that
he
had
a
magic
sword
too
cloaks
of
darkness
are
not
allowed
of
course
said
the
chancellor
of
euralia
why
have
got
one
said
each
king
quickly
to
the
other
merriwig
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
i
have
one
naturally
he
said
it
a
curious
thing
that
the
only
one
of
my
subjects
who
has
one
is
my
er
swineherd
that
funny
said
the
king
of
barodia
my
swineherd
has
one
too
of
course
said
merriwig
they
are
almost
a
necessity
to
swineherding
particularly
in
the
milking
season
said
the
king
of
barodia
they
looked
at
each
other
with
added
respect
not
many
kings
in
those
days
had
the
technicalities
of
such
a
humble
trade
at
their
ends
the
chancellor
of
barodia
has
been
referring
to
the
precedents
it
was
after
the
famous
conflict
between
the
two
grandfathers
of
your
majesties
that
the
use
of
the
magic
cloak
in
personal
combats
was
discontinued
said
the
chancellor
of
euralia
grandfathers
i
think
if
i
am
not
mistaken
their
tempers
were
rising
rapidly
and
the
chancellor
of
barodia
was
just
about
to
give
the
chancellor
of
euralia
a
push
when
merriwig
intervened
never
mind
about
that
he
said
impatiently
tell
us
what
happened
when
our
our
ancestors
fought
it
happened
in
this
way
your
majesty
your
grandfather
said
a
small
voice
the
chancellor
cast
one
bitter
look
at
his
opponent
and
went
on
the
ancestors
of
your
two
majesties
arranged
to
settle
the
war
of
that
period
by
personal
combat
the
two
armies
were
drawn
up
in
full
array
in
front
of
them
the
two
monarchs
shook
hands
drawing
their
swords
and
casting
their
magic
cloaks
around
them
they
well
said
merriwig
eagerly
it
is
rather
a
painful
story
your
majesty
go
on
i
sha
mind
well
your
majesty
drawing
their
swords
and
casting
their
magic
cloaks
around
them
they
returned
to
the
wassail
bowl
dear
dear
said
merriwig
illustration
the
respective
armies
returned
to
camp
they
found
their
majesties
when
the
respective
armies
who
had
been
waiting
eagerly
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
for
some
result
of
the
combat
returned
to
camp
they
found
their
majesties
asleep
said
the
chancellor
of
euralia
hastily
asleep
agreed
the
chancellor
of
barodia
the
excuse
of
their
two
majesties
that
they
had
suddenly
forgotten
the
day
though
naturally
accepted
at
the
time
was
deemed
inadequate
by
later
historians
by
roger
and
myself
anyway
some
further
details
were
discussed
and
then
the
conference
closed
the
great
fight
was
fixed
for
the
following
morning
the
day
broke
fine
at
an
early
hour
merriwig
was
up
and
practising
thrusts
upon
a
suspended
pillow
at
intervals
he
would
consult
a
little
book
entitled
play
for
and
then
return
to
his
pillow
at
breakfast
he
was
nervous
but
talkative
after
breakfast
he
wrote
a
tender
letter
to
hyacinth
and
a
still
more
tender
one
to
the
countess
belvane
and
burnt
them
he
repeated
his
little
rhyme
bo
boll
bill
bole
several
times
to
himself
until
he
was
word
perfect
it
was
just
possible
that
it
might
be
useful
his
last
thoughts
as
he
rode
on
to
the
field
were
of
his
without
admiring
him
he
quite
saw
his
point
the
fight
was
a
brilliant
one
first
merriwig
aimed
a
blow
at
the
king
of
barodia
head
which
the
latter
parried
then
the
king
of
barodia
aimed
a
blow
at
his
adversary
head
which
merriwig
parried
this
went
on
three
or
four
times
and
then
merriwig
put
into
practice
a
remarkable
trick
which
the
captain
of
his
bodyguard
had
taught
him
it
was
his
turn
to
parry
but
instead
of
doing
this
he
struck
again
at
his
opponent
head
and
if
the
latter
in
sheer
surprise
had
not
stumbled
and
fallen
there
might
have
been
a
very
serious
ending
to
the
affair
noon
found
them
still
at
it
cut
and
parry
cut
and
parry
at
each
stroke
the
opposing
armies
roared
their
applause
when
darkness
put
an
end
to
the
conflict
honours
were
evenly
divided
it
was
a
stiff
but
proud
king
of
euralia
who
received
the
congratulations
of
his
subjects
that
night
so
proud
that
he
had
to
pour
out
his
heart
to
somebody
he
wrote
to
his
daughter
my
dear
hyacinth
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
your
father
is
going
on
well
and
that
euralia
is
as
determined
as
ever
to
uphold
its
honour
and
dignity
i
fought
the
king
of
barodia
and
considering
that
most
unfairly
he
was
using
a
magic
sword
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
did
well
the
countess
belvane
will
be
interested
to
hear
that
i
made
strokes
at
my
opponent
and
parried
strokes
from
him
this
is
good
for
a
man
of
my
age
do
you
remember
that
magic
ointment
my
aunt
used
to
give
me
have
we
any
of
it
left
i
played
a
very
clever
trick
the
other
day
by
pretending
to
be
a
swineherd
i
talked
to
a
real
one
i
met
for
quite
a
long
time
about
swine
without
his
suspecting
me
the
countess
might
be
interested
to
hear
this
it
would
have
been
very
awkward
for
me
if
it
had
been
found
out
who
i
was
i
hope
you
are
getting
along
all
right
do
you
consult
the
countess
belvane
at
all
i
think
she
would
be
able
to
advise
you
in
any
difficulties
a
young
girl
needs
a
guiding
hand
and
i
think
the
countess
would
be
able
to
advise
you
in
any
difficulties
do
you
consult
her
at
all
i
am
afraid
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
war
there
does
seem
to
be
a
wizard
in
the
country
at
all
and
without
one
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
know
how
to
go
on
i
say
my
spell
every
now
and
then
you
remember
the
one
boll
bill
woll
will
and
it
certainly
keeps
off
dragons
but
we
do
seem
to
get
any
nearer
defeating
the
enemy
army
you
might
tell
the
countess
belvane
that
about
my
spell
she
would
be
interested
i
go
on
with
my
fight
with
the
king
of
barodia
i
feel
quite
confident
now
that
i
can
hold
him
he
parries
well
but
his
cutting
is
not
very
good
i
am
glad
the
countess
found
my
sword
for
me
tell
her
that
it
has
been
most
useful
i
must
now
close
as
i
must
go
to
bed
so
as
to
be
ready
for
my
fight
dear
i
am
always
your
loving
father
i
hope
you
are
not
finding
your
position
too
difficult
if
you
are
in
any
difficulties
you
should
consult
the
countess
belvane
i
think
she
would
be
able
to
advise
you
do
forget
about
that
ointment
perhaps
the
countess
might
know
about
some
other
kind
it
for
stiffness
i
am
afraid
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
war
the
king
sealed
up
the
letter
and
despatched
it
by
special
messenger
the
next
morning
it
came
to
hyacinth
at
a
critical
moment
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
what
effect
it
had
upon
her
chapter
vii
the
princess
receives
a
letter
and
writes
one
the
princess
hyacinth
came
in
from
her
morning
ride
in
a
very
bad
temper
she
went
straight
up
to
her
favourite
seat
on
the
castle
walls
and
sent
for
wiggs
wiggs
she
said
what
the
matter
with
me
wiggs
looked
puzzled
she
had
been
dusting
the
books
in
the
library
and
when
you
dust
books
you
simply
stop
every
now
and
then
to
take
just
one
little
peep
inside
and
then
you
look
inside
another
one
and
another
one
and
by
the
time
you
have
finished
dusting
your
head
is
so
full
of
things
you
have
seen
that
you
have
to
be
asked
questions
very
slowly
indeed
i
pretty
are
i
went
on
hyacinth
that
was
an
easy
one
lovely
said
wiggs
with
a
deep
breath
and
i
not
unkind
to
anybody
unkind
said
wiggs
indignantly
then
why
oh
wiggs
i
know
it
silly
of
me
but
it
me
that
my
people
are
so
much
fonder
of
the
countess
than
of
me
oh
i
sure
they
not
your
royal
highness
well
they
cheer
her
much
louder
than
they
cheer
me
wiggs
tried
to
think
of
a
way
of
comforting
her
mistress
but
her
head
was
still
full
of
the
last
book
she
had
dusted
why
should
they
be
so
fond
of
her
demanded
hyacinth
perhaps
because
she
so
funny
said
wiggs
funny
is
she
funny
said
the
princess
coldly
she
does
make
laugh
well
it
funny
of
her
to
make
woggs
march
round
and
round
that
tree
like
that
it
like
what
you
do
mean
the
princess
eyes
were
wide
open
with
astonishment
was
that
woggs
all
the
time
yes
your
royal
highness
was
it
lovely
and
funny
of
her
the
princess
looked
across
to
the
forest
and
nodded
to
herself
yes
that
it
wiggs
i
do
believe
there
has
ever
been
an
army
at
all
and
i
pay
them
every
week
she
added
solemnly
there
are
moments
when
i
do
believe
that
woman
is
quite
honest
do
you
mean
she
is
good
asked
wiggs
in
awe
hyacinth
nodded
i
good
said
wiggs
firmly
what
do
you
mean
silly
you
the
best
little
girl
in
euralia
i
i
do
awful
things
sometimes
do
you
know
what
i
did
yesterday
something
terrible
smiled
hyacinth
i
tore
my
apron
you
baby
that
is
being
bad
said
hyacinth
absently
she
was
still
thinking
of
that
awful
review
the
countess
says
it
is
the
countess
do
you
know
why
i
want
to
be
good
said
wiggs
coming
up
close
to
the
princess
why
dear
because
then
i
could
dance
like
a
fairy
is
that
how
it
done
asked
the
princess
rather
amused
the
countess
must
dance
heavily
she
suddenly
remembered
something
and
added
why
of
course
child
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
a
fairy
you
met
were
you
that
was
weeks
ago
though
tell
me
now
it
will
help
me
to
forget
things
which
make
me
rather
angry
it
was
a
simple
little
story
there
must
have
been
many
like
it
in
the
books
which
wiggs
had
been
dusting
but
these
were
simple
times
and
the
oldest
story
always
seemed
new
wiggs
had
been
by
herself
in
the
forest
a
baby
rabbit
had
run
past
her
terrified
a
ferret
in
pursuit
wiggs
had
picked
the
little
fluffy
thing
up
in
her
arms
and
comforted
it
the
ferret
had
slowed
down
walked
past
very
indifferently
with
its
hands
as
it
were
in
its
pockets
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
remembered
an
important
letter
which
it
had
forgotten
to
post
wiggs
was
left
alone
with
the
baby
rabbit
and
before
she
knew
where
she
was
the
rabbit
was
gone
and
there
was
a
fairy
in
front
of
her
illustration
rabbit
was
gone
and
there
was
a
fairy
in
front
of
you
have
saved
my
life
said
the
fairy
that
was
a
wicked
magician
after
me
and
if
he
had
caught
me
then
he
would
have
killed
me
please
your
fairiness
i
did
know
fairies
die
said
wiggs
they
can
when
they
take
on
animal
shape
or
human
shape
he
could
not
hurt
me
now
but
before
she
shuddered
i
so
glad
you
all
right
now
said
wiggs
politely
thanks
to
you
my
child
i
must
reward
you
take
this
ring
when
you
have
been
good
for
a
whole
day
you
can
have
one
good
wish
when
you
have
been
bad
for
a
whole
day
you
can
have
one
bad
wish
one
good
wish
and
one
bad
wish
that
is
all
it
will
allow
anybody
to
have
with
these
words
she
vanished
and
left
wiggs
alone
with
the
ring
so
ever
after
that
wiggs
tried
desperately
hard
to
be
good
and
have
the
good
wish
but
it
was
difficult
work
something
always
went
wrong
she
tore
her
apron
or
read
books
when
she
ought
to
have
been
dusting
or
well
you
or
i
would
probably
have
given
it
up
at
once
and
devoted
ourselves
to
earning
the
bad
wish
but
wiggs
was
a
nice
little
girl
and
oh
i
so
want
to
be
good
said
wiggs
earnestly
to
the
princess
so
that
i
could
wish
to
dance
like
a
fairy
she
had
a
sudden
anxiety
that
a
good
wish
it
it
a
lovely
wish
but
i
sure
you
could
dance
now
if
you
tried
i
ca
said
wiggs
i
always
dance
like
this
she
jumped
up
and
danced
a
few
steps
wiggs
was
a
dear
little
girl
but
her
dancing
reminded
you
of
a
very
dusty
road
going
all
the
way
with
nothing
but
waiting
for
you
on
the
top
something
like
that
it
is
graceful
is
it
she
said
candidly
as
she
came
to
rest
well
i
suppose
the
fairies
dance
better
than
that
so
that
why
i
want
to
be
good
so
as
i
can
have
my
wish
i
really
must
see
this
ring
said
the
princess
it
sounds
fascinating
she
looked
coldly
in
front
of
her
and
added
countess
how
long
had
the
woman
been
there
your
royal
highness
i
ventured
to
come
up
unannounced
ah
sweet
child
she
waved
a
caressing
hand
at
wiggs
even
if
she
had
overheard
anything
it
had
only
been
child
talk
what
is
it
asked
the
princess
she
took
a
firm
hold
of
the
arms
of
her
chair
she
would
give
way
to
the
countess
this
time
the
merest
matter
of
business
your
royal
highness
just
this
scheme
for
the
encouragement
of
literature
your
royal
highness
very
wisely
decided
that
in
the
absence
of
the
men
on
the
sterner
business
of
fighting
it
was
the
part
of
us
women
to
encourage
the
gentler
arts
and
for
this
purpose
there
was
some
talk
of
a
competition
and
er
ah
yes
said
hyacinth
nervously
i
will
look
into
that
a
competition
said
belvane
gazing
vaguely
over
hyacinth
head
some
sort
of
a
money
prize
she
added
as
if
in
a
trance
there
should
certainly
be
some
sort
of
a
prize
agreed
the
princess
why
not
she
asked
herself
if
one
is
to
encourage
literature
bags
of
gold
murmured
belvane
to
herself
bags
and
bags
of
gold
big
bags
of
silver
and
little
bags
of
gold
she
saw
herself
tossing
them
to
the
crowd
well
we
go
into
that
said
hyacinth
hastily
i
have
it
all
drawn
up
here
said
belvane
your
royal
highness
has
only
to
sign
it
saves
much
trouble
she
added
with
a
disarming
smile
she
held
the
document
out
all
in
the
most
beautiful
colours
mechanically
the
princess
signed
thank
you
your
royal
highness
she
smiled
again
and
added
and
now
perhaps
i
had
better
see
about
it
at
once
the
guardian
of
literature
took
a
dignified
farewell
of
her
sovereign
and
withdrew
hyacinth
looked
at
wiggs
in
despair
there
she
said
that
me
i
do
know
what
it
is
about
that
woman
but
i
feel
just
a
child
in
front
of
her
oh
wiggs
wiggs
i
feel
so
lonely
sometimes
with
nothing
but
women
all
around
me
i
wish
i
had
a
man
here
to
help
me
are
the
men
fighting
in
the
countries
not
all
the
countries
there
araby
do
you
remember
oh
but
of
course
you
would
know
anything
about
it
but
father
was
just
going
to
ask
prince
udo
of
araby
to
come
here
on
a
visit
when
the
war
broke
out
oh
i
wish
i
father
were
back
again
she
laid
her
head
on
her
arms
and
whether
she
would
have
shed
a
few
royal
tears
or
had
a
good
homely
cry
i
can
not
tell
you
for
at
that
moment
an
attendant
came
in
hyacinth
was
herself
again
at
once
there
is
a
messenger
approaching
on
a
horse
your
royal
highness
she
announced
doubtless
from
his
majesty
camp
with
a
shriek
of
delight
and
an
entire
lack
of
royal
dignity
the
princess
followed
by
the
faithful
wiggs
rushed
down
to
receive
him
meanwhile
what
of
the
countess
she
was
still
in
the
palace
and
more
than
that
she
was
in
the
throne
room
of
the
palace
and
more
even
than
that
she
was
on
the
throne
of
the
throne
room
of
the
palace
she
could
resist
it
the
door
was
open
as
she
came
down
from
her
interview
with
the
princess
and
she
had
to
go
in
there
was
a
woman
in
there
tidying
up
who
looked
questioningly
at
belvane
as
she
entered
you
may
leave
said
the
countess
with
dignity
her
royal
highness
sent
me
in
here
to
wait
for
her
the
woman
curtsied
and
withdrew
the
countess
then
uttered
these
extraordinary
words
when
i
am
queen
in
euralia
they
shall
leave
me
backwards
her
subsequent
behaviour
was
even
more
amazing
she
stood
by
the
side
of
the
door
and
putting
her
hand
to
her
mouth
said
shrilly
then
she
took
her
hand
away
and
announced
loudly
her
majesty
queen
belvane
the
first
after
which
she
cheered
slightly
then
in
came
her
majesty
a
very
proper
dignified
gracious
queen
none
of
your
chits
bowing
condescendingly
from
side
to
side
she
made
her
way
to
the
throne
and
with
a
sweep
of
her
train
she
sat
down
courtiers
were
presented
to
her
representatives
from
foreign
countries
prince
hanspatch
of
tregong
prince
ulric
the
duke
of
highanlow
ah
my
dear
prince
hanspatch
she
cried
stretching
out
her
hand
to
the
right
of
her
and
you
dear
prince
ulric
with
a
graceful
movement
of
the
left
arm
towards
him
and
dear
duke
also
her
right
hand
which
prince
hanspatch
had
by
now
finished
with
went
out
to
the
duke
of
highanlow
that
he
too
might
kiss
it
but
it
was
arrested
in
she
felt
rather
than
saw
that
the
princess
was
watching
her
in
amazement
from
the
doorway
without
looking
round
she
stretched
out
again
first
one
arm
and
then
the
other
then
as
if
she
had
just
seen
the
princess
she
jumped
up
in
a
pretty
confusion
oh
your
royal
highness
she
cried
you
caught
me
at
my
physical
exercises
she
gave
a
little
laugh
my
physical
exercises
a
forearm
movement
once
again
she
stretched
out
her
arm
building
up
the
er
building
up
building
up
her
voice
died
away
for
the
princess
still
looked
coldly
at
her
charming
countess
she
said
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
i
have
some
news
for
you
you
will
like
to
know
that
i
am
inviting
prince
udo
of
araby
here
on
a
visit
i
feel
we
want
a
little
outside
help
in
our
affairs
prince
udo
cried
the
countess
have
you
any
objection
said
hyacinth
she
found
it
easier
to
be
stern
now
for
the
invitation
had
already
been
sent
off
by
the
hand
of
the
king
messenger
nothing
that
the
countess
could
say
could
influence
her
no
objection
your
royal
highness
but
it
seems
so
strange
and
then
the
expense
men
are
such
hearty
eaters
besides
she
looked
with
a
charming
smile
from
the
princess
to
wiggs
we
were
all
getting
on
so
together
of
course
if
he
just
dropped
in
for
afternoon
tea
one
day
he
will
make
a
stay
of
some
months
i
hope
there
were
no
wizards
in
barodia
and
therefore
the
war
would
be
a
long
one
it
was
this
which
had
decided
hyacinth
of
course
said
belvane
whatever
your
royal
highness
wishes
but
i
do
think
that
his
majesty
my
dear
countess
said
hyacinth
with
a
smile
the
invitation
has
already
gone
so
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
is
there
had
you
finished
your
exercises
yes
then
wiggs
will
you
conduct
her
ladyship
downstairs
she
turned
and
left
her
the
countess
watched
her
go
and
then
stood
tragically
in
the
middle
of
the
room
clasping
her
diary
to
her
breast
this
is
terrible
she
said
i
feel
older
she
held
out
her
diary
at
arm
length
and
said
in
a
gloomy
voice
an
entry
for
the
thought
cheered
her
up
a
little
she
began
to
consider
plans
how
could
she
circumvent
this
terrible
young
man
who
was
going
to
put
them
all
in
their
places
she
wished
that
all
at
once
she
remembered
something
wiggs
she
said
what
was
it
i
heard
you
saying
to
the
princess
about
a
wish
oh
that
my
ring
said
wiggs
eagerly
if
you
been
good
for
a
whole
day
you
can
have
a
good
wish
and
my
wish
is
that
a
wish
said
belvane
to
herself
well
i
wish
that
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
you
said
that
you
had
to
be
good
for
a
whole
day
first
yes
belvane
mused
i
wonder
what
they
mean
by
she
said
of
course
explained
wiggs
if
you
been
bad
for
a
whole
day
you
can
have
a
bad
wish
but
i
should
hate
to
have
a
bad
wish
you
simply
hate
it
child
said
belvane
er
may
i
have
a
look
at
that
ring
here
it
is
said
wiggs
i
always
wear
it
round
my
neck
the
countess
took
it
from
her
listen
she
said
was
that
the
princess
calling
you
run
along
quickly
child
she
almost
pushed
her
from
the
room
and
closed
the
door
on
her
alone
again
she
paced
from
end
to
end
of
the
great
chamber
her
left
hand
nursing
her
right
elbow
her
chin
in
her
right
hand
if
you
are
good
for
a
day
she
mused
you
can
have
a
good
wish
if
you
are
bad
for
a
day
you
can
have
a
bad
wish
yesterday
i
drew
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
for
the
army
the
actual
expenses
were
what
i
paid
what
i
owe
woggs
i
suppose
that
is
what
people
call
being
bad
i
suppose
this
prince
udo
would
call
it
bad
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
will
marry
the
princess
and
throw
me
into
prison
she
flung
her
head
back
proudly
never
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
great
throne
room
she
held
the
ring
up
in
her
two
hands
and
wished
i
wish
she
said
and
there
was
a
terrible
smile
in
her
eyes
i
wish
that
something
very
very
shall
happen
to
prince
udo
on
his
journey
chapter
viii
prince
udo
sleeps
badly
everybody
likes
to
make
a
good
impression
on
his
first
visit
but
there
were
moments
just
before
his
arrival
in
euralia
when
prince
udo
doubted
whether
the
affair
would
go
as
well
as
he
had
hoped
you
shall
hear
why
he
had
been
out
hunting
with
his
friend
the
young
duke
coronel
and
was
returning
to
the
palace
when
hyacinth
messenger
met
him
he
took
the
letter
from
him
broke
the
seals
and
unrolled
it
wait
a
moment
coronel
he
said
to
his
friend
this
is
going
to
be
an
adventure
of
some
sort
and
if
it
an
adventure
i
shall
want
you
with
me
i
in
no
hurry
said
coronel
and
he
got
off
his
horse
and
gave
it
into
the
care
of
an
attendant
the
road
crossed
a
stream
here
coronel
sat
up
on
the
little
stone
bridge
and
dropped
pebbles
idly
into
the
water
the
prince
read
his
letter
plop
plop
plop
the
prince
looked
up
from
his
letter
how
many
days
journey
is
it
to
euralia
he
asked
coronel
how
long
did
it
take
the
messenger
to
come
answered
coronel
without
looking
up
i
might
have
thought
of
that
myself
said
udo
only
this
letter
has
rather
upset
me
he
turned
to
the
messenger
how
long
has
it
is
the
letter
dated
said
coronel
udo
paid
no
attention
to
this
interruption
and
finished
his
question
to
the
messenger
a
week
sire
ride
on
to
the
castle
and
wait
for
me
i
shall
have
a
message
for
you
what
is
it
said
coronel
when
the
messenger
had
gone
an
adventure
i
think
so
i
think
we
may
call
it
that
coronel
with
me
in
it
yes
i
think
you
will
be
somewhere
in
it
coronel
stopped
dropping
his
pebbles
and
turned
to
the
prince
may
i
hear
about
it
udo
help
out
the
letter
then
feeling
that
a
lady
letter
should
be
private
drew
it
back
again
he
prided
himself
always
on
doing
the
correct
thing
it
from
princess
hyacinth
of
euralia
he
said
she
does
say
much
her
father
is
away
fighting
and
she
is
alone
and
she
is
in
some
trouble
or
other
it
ought
to
make
rather
a
good
adventure
coronel
turned
away
and
began
to
drop
his
pebbles
into
the
stream
again
well
i
wish
you
luck
he
said
if
it
a
dragon
do
forget
that
but
you
coming
too
said
udo
in
dismay
i
must
have
you
with
me
doing
what
what
doing
what
said
coronel
again
well
said
prince
udo
awkwardly
er
well
you
well
he
felt
that
it
was
a
silly
question
for
coronel
to
have
asked
coronel
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
would
be
doing
all
the
time
in
udo
absence
he
would
be
telling
princess
hyacinth
stories
of
his
royal
highness
matchless
courage
and
wisdom
an
occasional
discussion
also
with
the
princess
upon
the
types
of
masculine
beauty
leading
up
to
casual
mention
of
prince
udo
own
appearance
would
be
quite
in
order
when
prince
udo
was
present
coronel
would
no
doubt
find
the
opportunity
of
drawing
prince
udo
out
an
opportunity
of
which
a
stranger
could
not
so
readily
avail
himself
but
of
course
you
could
very
well
tell
coronel
that
a
man
of
any
tact
would
have
seen
it
at
once
of
course
he
said
do
come
if
you
do
like
but
it
would
look
rather
funny
if
i
went
quite
unattended
and
and
her
royal
highness
is
said
to
be
very
beautiful
he
added
lamely
coronel
laughed
there
are
adventures
and
adventures
to
sit
next
to
a
very
beautiful
princess
and
discuss
with
her
the
good
looks
of
another
man
was
not
the
sort
of
adventure
that
coronel
was
looking
for
he
tossed
the
remainder
of
his
pebbles
into
the
stream
and
stood
up
of
course
if
your
royal
highness
wishes
do
be
a
fool
coronel
said
his
royal
highness
rather
snappily
well
then
i
come
with
my
good
friend
udo
if
he
wants
me
i
do
want
you
very
well
that
settles
it
after
all
he
added
to
himself
there
may
be
dragons
two
dragons
would
be
one
each
but
from
all
accounts
there
were
not
two
princesses
so
three
days
later
the
friends
set
out
with
good
hearts
upon
the
adventure
the
messenger
had
been
sent
back
to
announce
their
arrival
they
gave
him
three
days
start
and
hoped
to
gain
two
days
upon
him
in
the
simple
fashion
of
those
times
so
it
would
seem
from
roger
scurvilegs
they
set
out
with
no
luggage
and
no
clear
idea
of
where
they
were
going
to
sleep
at
night
this
after
all
is
the
best
spirit
in
which
to
start
a
journey
it
is
the
gladstone
bag
which
has
killed
romance
they
started
on
a
perfect
summer
day
and
they
rode
past
towers
and
battlements
and
by
the
side
of
sparkling
streams
and
came
out
into
the
sunlight
again
above
sleepy
villages
and
as
they
rode
coronel
sang
aloud
and
udo
tossed
his
sword
into
the
air
and
caught
it
again
as
evening
fell
they
came
to
a
woodman
cottage
at
the
foot
of
a
high
hill
and
there
they
decided
to
rest
for
the
night
an
old
woman
came
out
to
welcome
them
good
evening
your
royal
highness
she
said
illustration
evening
fell
they
came
to
a
woodman
cottage
at
the
foot
of
a
high
you
know
me
said
udo
more
pleased
than
surprised
i
know
all
who
come
into
my
house
said
the
old
woman
solemnly
and
all
who
go
away
from
it
this
sort
of
conversation
made
coronel
feel
creepy
there
seemed
to
be
a
distinction
between
the
people
who
came
to
the
house
and
the
people
who
went
away
from
it
which
he
did
not
like
can
we
stay
here
the
night
my
good
woman
said
udo
you
have
hurt
your
hand
she
said
taking
no
notice
of
his
question
it
nothing
said
udo
hastily
on
one
occasion
he
had
caught
his
sword
by
the
sharp
end
by
mistake
a
foolish
thing
to
have
done
ah
well
since
you
wo
want
hands
where
you
going
it
matter
much
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
old
women
said
in
those
days
and
udo
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
yes
yes
he
said
but
can
you
give
my
friend
and
myself
a
bed
for
seeing
that
you
wo
be
travelling
together
long
come
in
and
welcome
she
opened
the
door
and
they
followed
her
in
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
udo
half
turned
round
and
whispered
over
his
shoulder
to
coronel
probably
a
fairy
be
kind
to
her
how
can
one
be
kind
to
one
hostess
said
coronel
it
she
who
has
to
be
kind
to
well
you
know
what
i
mean
do
be
rude
to
her
my
dear
udo
this
to
the
pride
of
araby
the
favourite
courtier
of
his
majesty
the
oh
all
right
said
udo
sit
down
and
rest
yourselves
said
the
old
woman
there
be
something
in
the
pot
for
you
directly
good
said
udo
he
looked
approvingly
at
the
large
cauldron
hanging
over
the
fire
it
was
a
big
fireplace
for
such
a
small
room
so
he
thought
when
he
first
looked
at
it
but
as
he
gazed
the
room
seemed
to
get
bigger
and
bigger
and
the
fireplace
to
get
farther
and
farther
away
until
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
vast
cavern
cut
deep
into
the
mountainside
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
there
he
was
in
the
small
kitchen
again
and
the
cauldron
was
sending
out
a
savoury
smell
there
be
something
in
it
for
all
tastes
went
on
the
old
woman
even
for
prince
udo
i
not
so
particular
as
all
that
said
udo
mildly
the
room
had
just
become
five
hundred
yards
long
again
and
he
was
feeling
quiet
not
now
but
you
will
be
she
filled
them
a
plate
each
from
the
pot
and
pulling
their
chairs
up
to
the
table
they
fell
to
heartily
this
is
really
excellent
said
udo
as
he
put
down
his
spoon
and
rested
for
a
moment
you
think
you
always
like
that
would
you
she
said
i
always
shall
be
fond
of
anything
so
perfectly
cooked
ah
remarked
the
old
woman
thoughtfully
udo
was
beginning
to
dislike
her
particular
style
of
conversation
it
seemed
to
carry
the
merest
suggestion
of
a
hint
that
something
unpleasant
was
going
to
happen
to
him
nothing
apparently
was
going
to
happen
to
coronel
he
tried
to
drag
coronel
into
the
conversation
in
case
the
old
woman
had
anything
over
for
him
my
friend
and
i
he
said
hope
to
be
in
euralia
the
day
after
no
harm
in
hoping
was
the
answer
dear
me
is
something
going
to
happen
to
us
on
the
way
depends
what
you
call
coronel
pushed
back
his
chair
and
got
up
i
know
what
going
to
happen
to
me
he
said
i
going
to
sleep
well
said
udo
getting
up
too
we
got
a
long
day
before
us
and
apparently
we
are
in
for
an
adventure
er
are
in
for
an
adventure
of
some
sort
he
looked
anxiously
at
the
old
woman
but
she
made
no
sign
and
so
let
to
bed
this
way
said
the
old
woman
and
by
the
light
of
a
candle
she
led
them
upstairs
udo
slept
badly
he
had
a
feeling
just
as
you
have
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
him
and
it
was
with
some
surprise
that
he
woke
up
in
the
morning
to
find
himself
much
as
he
was
when
he
went
to
bed
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
invited
coronel
to
gaze
at
him
but
neither
could
discover
that
anything
was
the
matter
after
all
said
udo
i
do
suppose
she
meant
anything
these
old
women
get
into
a
way
of
talking
like
that
if
anybody
is
going
to
be
turned
into
anything
it
much
more
likely
to
be
you
is
that
why
you
brought
me
with
you
asked
coronel
i
suppose
that
by
this
time
they
had
finished
their
dressing
roger
scurvilegs
tells
us
nothing
on
such
important
matters
no
doubt
from
modesty
next
morning
they
rose
he
says
and
disappoints
us
of
a
picture
of
udo
brushing
his
hair
they
rose
and
went
down
to
breakfast
the
old
woman
was
in
a
less
cryptic
mood
at
breakfast
she
was
particularly
hospitable
to
udo
and
from
some
secret
store
produced
an
unending
variety
of
good
things
for
him
to
eat
to
coronel
it
almost
looked
as
if
she
were
fattening
him
up
for
something
but
this
suggestion
was
received
with
such
bad
grace
by
udo
that
he
did
not
pursue
the
subject
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
they
started
off
again
from
one
of
the
many
bags
of
gold
he
carried
udo
had
offered
some
acknowledgment
to
the
old
woman
but
she
had
refused
to
take
it
nay
nay
she
said
i
shall
be
amply
rewarded
before
the
day
is
out
and
she
seemed
to
be
smiling
to
herself
as
if
she
knew
of
some
joke
which
the
prince
and
coronel
did
not
yet
share
i
like
said
coronel
as
they
rode
along
there
a
smell
of
adventure
in
the
air
red
roofs
green
trees
blue
sky
white
road
i
could
fall
in
love
who
with
said
udo
suspiciously
any
one
that
old
woman
if
you
like
oh
do
talk
of
her
said
the
prince
with
a
shudder
coronel
had
you
a
sense
of
being
of
some
joke
that
she
was
in
perhaps
we
shall
be
in
it
before
long
i
could
laugh
very
easily
on
a
morning
like
this
oh
i
can
see
a
joke
as
well
as
any
one
said
udo
do
be
afraid
that
i
sha
laugh
too
no
doubt
it
will
make
a
good
story
whatever
it
is
to
tell
to
the
princess
hyacinth
coronel
he
added
solemnly
the
thought
having
evidently
only
just
occurred
to
him
i
am
all
impatience
to
help
that
poor
girl
in
her
trouble
and
as
if
to
show
his
impatience
he
suddenly
gave
the
reins
a
shake
and
cantered
ahead
of
his
companion
smiling
to
himself
coronel
followed
at
his
leisure
they
halted
at
in
a
wood
and
made
a
meal
from
some
provisions
which
the
old
woman
had
given
them
and
after
they
had
eaten
udo
lay
down
on
a
mossy
bank
and
closed
his
eyes
i
sleepy
he
said
i
had
a
restless
night
let
stay
here
awhile
after
all
there
no
hurry
personally
said
coronel
i
all
impatience
to
help
that
i
tell
you
i
had
a
very
bad
night
said
udo
crossly
oh
well
i
shall
go
off
and
look
for
dragons
coronel
the
dragon
slayer
only
half
an
hour
said
udo
right
with
a
nod
to
the
prince
he
strolled
off
among
the
trees
chapter
ix
they
are
afraid
of
udo
this
is
a
painful
chapter
for
me
to
write
mercifully
it
is
to
be
a
short
one
later
on
i
shall
become
used
to
the
situation
inclined
even
to
dwell
upon
its
humorous
side
but
for
the
moment
i
can
not
see
beyond
the
sadness
of
it
that
to
a
prince
of
the
royal
house
of
araby
and
such
an
estimable
young
man
as
udo
those
things
should
happen
roger
scurvilegs
frankly
breaks
down
over
it
that
abominable
woman
he
says
meaning
of
course
belvane
and
he
has
hysterics
for
more
than
a
page
let
us
describe
it
calmly
coronel
came
back
from
his
stroll
in
the
same
casual
way
in
which
he
had
started
and
dropped
down
lazily
upon
the
grass
to
wait
until
udo
was
ready
to
mount
he
was
not
thinking
of
udo
he
was
wondering
if
princess
hyacinth
had
an
attendant
of
surpassing
beauty
or
a
dragon
of
surpassing
malevolence
if
in
fact
there
were
any
adventures
in
euralia
for
a
humble
fellow
like
himself
coronel
said
a
small
voice
behind
him
he
turned
round
indifferently
hullo
udo
where
are
you
he
said
is
it
time
we
were
starting
we
are
starting
said
the
voice
what
the
matter
what
are
you
hiding
in
the
bushes
for
whatever
the
matter
udo
i
not
very
well
my
poor
udo
what
happened
he
jumped
up
and
made
towards
him
stop
shrieked
the
voice
i
command
you
coronel
stopped
your
royal
highness
commands
he
began
rather
coldly
there
was
an
ominous
sniffing
from
the
bushes
coronel
said
an
unhappy
voice
at
last
i
think
i
coming
out
wondering
what
it
all
meant
coronel
waited
in
silence
yes
i
am
coming
out
coronel
said
the
voice
but
you
must
be
surprised
if
i
do
look
very
well
i
i
coronel
here
i
am
said
udo
pathetically
and
he
stepped
out
coronel
did
know
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
poor
prince
udo
illustration
coronel
here
i
am
said
udo
pathetically
and
he
stepped
he
had
the
head
and
the
long
ears
of
a
rabbit
and
in
some
unfortunate
way
a
look
of
the
real
prince
udo
in
spite
of
it
he
had
the
mane
and
the
tail
of
a
lion
in
between
the
tail
and
the
mane
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
he
was
save
that
there
was
an
impression
of
magnificence
about
his
person
such
magnificence
anyhow
as
is
given
by
an
fur
coat
coronel
decided
that
it
was
an
occasion
for
tact
ah
here
you
are
he
said
cheerfully
shall
we
get
along
do
be
a
fool
coronel
said
udo
almost
crying
do
pretend
that
you
ca
that
i
got
a
tail
why
bless
my
soul
so
you
have
a
tail
well
think
of
that
udo
showed
what
he
thought
of
it
by
waving
it
peevishly
this
is
not
a
time
for
tact
he
said
tell
me
what
i
look
like
coronel
considered
for
a
moment
really
frankly
he
asked
y
yes
said
udo
nervously
then
frankly
your
royal
highness
looks
funny
funny
said
udo
wistfully
funny
said
coronel
his
highness
sighed
i
was
afraid
so
he
said
that
the
cruel
part
about
it
had
i
been
a
lion
there
would
have
been
a
certain
pathetic
splendour
about
my
position
isolated
cut
off
suffering
in
regal
silence
he
waved
an
explanatory
paw
even
in
the
most
hideous
of
beasts
there
might
be
a
dignity
he
meditated
for
a
moment
have
you
ever
seen
a
yak
coronel
he
asked
never
i
saw
one
once
in
barodia
it
is
not
a
beautiful
animal
coronel
but
as
a
yak
i
should
not
have
been
entirely
unlovable
one
does
not
laugh
at
a
yak
coronel
and
where
one
does
not
laugh
one
may
come
to
love
what
does
my
head
look
like
it
looks
striking
i
have
seen
it
you
see
to
one
who
did
know
your
royal
highness
it
would
convey
the
impression
of
a
rabbit
udo
laid
his
head
between
his
paws
and
wept
a
r
rabbit
he
sobbed
so
undignified
so
lacking
in
true
pathos
so
and
not
even
a
whole
rabbit
he
added
bitterly
how
did
it
happen
i
do
know
coronel
i
just
went
to
sleep
and
woke
up
feeling
rather
funny
and
he
sat
up
suddenly
and
stared
at
coronel
it
was
that
old
woman
did
it
you
mark
my
words
coronel
she
did
it
why
should
she
i
do
know
i
was
very
polite
to
her
do
you
remember
my
saying
to
you
polite
to
her
because
she
probably
a
fairy
you
see
i
saw
through
her
disguise
at
once
coronel
what
shall
we
do
let
hold
a
council
of
war
and
think
it
over
so
they
held
a
council
of
war
prince
udo
put
forward
two
suggestions
the
first
was
that
coronel
should
go
back
on
the
morrow
and
kill
the
old
woman
the
second
was
that
coronel
should
go
back
that
afternoon
and
kill
the
old
woman
coronel
pointed
out
that
as
she
had
turned
prince
udo
into
into
a
a
quite
so
said
udo
it
was
likely
that
she
alone
could
turn
him
back
again
and
that
in
that
case
he
had
better
only
threaten
her
i
want
killed
said
udo
rather
naturally
suppose
said
coronel
you
stay
here
for
two
days
while
i
go
back
and
see
the
old
witch
and
make
her
tell
me
what
she
knows
she
knows
something
i
certain
then
we
shall
see
better
what
to
do
udo
mused
for
a
space
why
did
they
turn
into
anything
he
asked
really
i
do
know
perhaps
because
i
too
unimportant
yes
that
must
be
it
he
began
to
feel
a
little
brighter
obviously
that
it
he
caressed
a
whisker
with
one
of
his
paws
they
were
afraid
of
me
he
began
to
look
so
much
happier
that
coronel
thought
it
was
a
favourable
moment
in
which
to
withdraw
shall
i
go
now
your
royal
highness
yes
yes
you
may
leave
me
and
shall
i
find
you
here
when
i
come
back
you
may
or
you
may
not
coronel
you
may
or
you
may
not
afraid
of
me
he
murmured
to
himself
obviously
and
if
i
do
then
return
to
the
palace
your
royal
highness
udo
waved
a
paw
at
him
coronel
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
earshot
he
began
to
laugh
spasm
after
spasm
shook
him
no
sooner
had
he
composed
himself
to
gravity
than
a
remembrance
of
appearance
started
him
off
again
i
could
have
stayed
with
him
a
moment
longer
he
thought
i
should
have
burst
poor
udo
however
we
soon
get
him
all
right
that
evening
he
reached
the
place
where
the
cottage
had
stood
but
it
was
gone
next
morning
he
rode
back
to
the
wood
udo
was
gone
too
he
returned
to
the
palace
and
began
to
think
it
out
left
to
himself
udo
very
soon
made
up
his
mind
there
were
three
courses
open
to
him
he
might
stay
where
he
was
till
he
was
restored
to
health
this
he
rejected
at
once
when
you
have
the
head
of
a
rabbit
the
tail
of
a
lion
and
the
middle
of
a
woolly
lamb
the
need
for
action
of
some
kind
is
imperative
all
the
blood
of
your
diverse
ancestors
calls
to
you
to
be
up
and
doing
he
might
go
back
to
araby
to
araby
where
he
was
so
so
respected
so
popular
to
araby
where
he
rode
daily
among
his
father
subjects
that
they
might
have
the
pleasure
of
cheering
him
how
awkward
for
everybody
on
to
euralia
then
why
not
the
princess
hyacinth
had
called
for
him
what
devotion
it
showed
if
he
came
to
her
even
now
in
his
present
state
of
bad
health
she
was
in
trouble
enchanters
wizards
already
then
he
had
suffered
in
her
service
so
at
least
he
would
say
and
so
possibly
it
might
be
coronel
had
thought
him
funny
but
women
had
not
much
sense
of
humour
as
a
rule
probably
as
a
child
hyacinth
had
kept
rabbits
or
lambs
she
would
find
him
strokable
and
the
lion
in
him
in
his
tail
his
fierce
mane
she
would
find
that
inspiring
women
like
to
feel
that
there
is
something
fierce
untamable
in
the
man
they
love
well
there
it
was
it
was
not
as
if
he
had
coronel
with
him
coronel
and
he
in
his
present
health
could
never
have
gone
into
euralia
together
the
contrast
was
too
striking
but
he
alone
hyacinth
only
help
surely
she
would
appreciate
his
magnanimity
also
as
he
had
told
himself
a
moment
ago
there
was
quite
a
chance
that
it
was
a
euralian
enchanter
who
had
put
this
upon
him
to
prevent
him
helping
hyacinth
if
so
he
had
better
go
to
euralia
in
order
to
deal
with
that
enchanter
for
the
moment
he
did
not
see
exactly
how
to
deal
with
him
but
no
doubt
he
would
think
of
some
tremendously
cunning
device
later
on
to
euralia
then
with
all
dispatch
he
trotted
off
as
coronel
had
said
they
were
evidently
afraid
of
him
chapter

charlotte
patacake
astonishes
the
critics
the
lady
belvane
sits
in
her
garden
she
is
very
happy
an
enormous
taken
from
a
former
favourite
goose
and
coloured
red
is
in
her
right
hand
the
hair
of
her
dark
head
held
on
one
side
touches
the
paper
whereon
she
writes
and
her
little
tongue
peeps
out
between
her
red
lips
her
left
hand
taps
the
table
she
is
composing
wonderful
woman
you
remember
that
scene
with
the
princess
hyacinth
i
feel
we
want
a
little
outside
help
in
our
affairs
a
fortnight
of
suspense
before
prince
udo
arrived
what
had
the
ring
done
to
him
at
the
best
even
if
there
would
be
no
udo
at
all
to
interfere
nevertheless
she
knew
that
she
had
lost
her
footing
at
the
palace
she
and
the
princess
would
now
be
open
enemies
at
the
worst
those
magic
rings
were
so
untrustworthy
a
prince
still
powerful
and
now
seriously
annoyed
might
be
leagued
against
her
yet
she
composed
and
what
is
she
writing
she
is
entering
for
the
competition
in
connection
with
the
encouragement
of
literature
scheme
the
last
scheme
which
the
princess
had
signed
i
like
to
think
of
her
peacefully
writing
at
a
time
when
her
whole
future
hung
in
the
balance
roger
sneers
at
her
even
now
he
says
she
was
hoping
to
wring
a
last
of
gold
from
her
wretched
country
i
deny
emphatically
that
she
was
doing
anything
of
the
sort
she
was
entering
for
a
duly
authorised
competition
under
the
of
charlotte
patacake
the
fact
that
the
countess
belvane
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
scheme
was
sole
judge
of
the
competition
is
beside
the
point
belvane
opinion
of
charlotte
patacake
poetry
was
utterly
sincere
and
uninfluenced
in
any
way
by
monetary
considerations
if
patacake
were
rewarded
the
first
prize
it
would
be
because
belvane
honestly
thought
she
was
worth
it
one
other
fact
by
way
of
defence
against
roger
slanders
as
judge
belvane
had
chosen
the
subject
of
the
prize
poems
now
belvane
and
patacake
both
excelled
in
the
lighter
forms
of
lyrical
verse
yet
the
subject
of
the
poem
was
to
be
epic
the
war
no
less
how
many
modern
writers
would
be
as
fair
the
war
this
line
is
written
in
gold
and
by
itself
would
obtain
a
prize
in
any
local
competition
merriwig
the
first
rode
out
to
many
other
kings
had
done
before
hundred
men
behind
him
marched
to
fight
there
follows
a
good
deal
of
scratching
out
and
then
comes
a
sudden
inspiration
this
sublimely
simple
line
one
can
almost
hear
the
men
moving
gladsome
cheers
assailed
the
balmy
air
came
from
north
from
south
from
everywhere
wight
that
stood
upon
that
sacred
gaze
upon
the
sight
unmoved
i
ween
wight
that
stood
upon
that
sacred
gaze
upon
the
sight
unmoved
i
wot
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
the
last
couplet
is
an
alternative
to
the
couplet
before
or
is
purposely
added
in
order
to
strengthen
it
looking
over
her
left
shoulder
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
line
drawn
through
the
first
one
but
i
can
not
see
very
clearly
because
of
her
hair
which
will
keep
straying
over
the
page
do
they
march
so
fearless
and
so
bold
answer
is
not
very
quickly
put
it
shortly
the
barodian
merriwig
like
anything
merriwig
the
dignified
and
wise
saw
him
flying
over
with
surprise
did
his
daughter
princess
this
was
as
far
as
she
had
got
she
left
the
table
and
began
to
walk
round
her
garden
there
is
nothing
like
it
for
assisting
thought
however
it
was
not
helping
much
she
went
three
times
round
and
still
could
think
of
a
rhyme
for
hyacinth
plinth
was
a
little
difficult
to
work
in
besides
she
reminded
herself
i
do
quite
know
what
it
means
belvane
felt
as
i
do
about
poetry
that
however
incomprehensible
it
may
be
to
the
public
the
author
should
be
quite
at
ease
with
it
she
added
up
the
lines
she
had
written
already
seventeen
if
she
stopped
there
it
would
be
the
only
epic
that
had
stopped
at
the
seventeenth
line
she
sighed
stretched
her
arms
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
weather
was
all
against
her
it
was
the
ideal
largesse
morning
twenty
minutes
later
she
was
on
her
palfrey
minutes
later
henrietta
crossbuns
had
received
a
bag
of
gold
neatly
under
the
eye
as
she
bobbed
to
her
ladyship
to
this
extent
only
did
crossbuns
leave
her
mark
upon
euralian
history
but
it
was
a
mark
which
lasted
for
a
full
month
hyacinth
knew
nothing
of
all
this
she
did
not
even
know
that
belvane
was
entering
for
the
prize
poem
she
had
forgotten
her
promise
to
encourage
literature
in
the
realm
and
why
ah
ladies
can
you
not
guess
why
she
was
thinking
of
prince
udo
of
araby
what
did
he
look
like
was
he
dark
or
fair
did
his
hair
curl
naturally
or
not
was
he
wondering
at
all
what
looked
like
wiggs
had
already
decided
that
he
was
to
fall
in
love
with
her
royal
highness
and
marry
her
i
think
said
wiggs
that
he
be
very
tall
and
have
lovely
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
this
is
what
they
were
like
in
all
the
books
she
had
ever
dusted
like
this
were
the
seven
princes
now
pursuing
perilous
adventures
in
distant
countries
to
whom
the
king
had
promised
hand
prince
hanspatch
of
tregong
prince
ulric
the
duke
of
highanlow
and
all
the
rest
of
them
poor
prince
ulric
in
the
moment
of
victory
he
was
accidentally
fallen
upon
by
the
giant
whom
he
was
engaged
in
undermining
and
lost
all
appetite
for
adventure
thereby
indeed
in
his
latter
years
he
was
alarmed
by
anything
larger
than
a
goldfish
and
lived
a
life
of
strictest
seclusion
illustration
minutes
later
henrietta
crossbuns
was
acknowledging
a
bag
of
think
he
be
dark
said
hyacinth
her
own
hair
was
poor
prince
hanspatch
of
tregong
i
just
remembered
about
him
no
i
have
it
was
the
duke
of
highanlow
poor
duke
of
highanlow
a
misunderstanding
with
a
wizard
having
caused
his
head
to
face
the
wrong
way
round
he
was
so
often
said
to
at
the
very
moment
of
arrival
that
he
gradually
lost
his
enthusiasm
for
social
enterprises
and
confined
himself
to
his
own
palace
where
his
acrobatic
dexterity
in
supplying
himself
with
soup
was
a
constant
source
of
admiration
to
his
servants
however
it
was
prince
udo
of
whom
they
were
thinking
now
the
messenger
had
returned
from
araby
his
royal
highness
must
be
expected
on
the
morrow
i
do
hope
he
be
comfortable
in
the
purple
room
said
hyacinth
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
left
him
in
the
blue
room
after
all
they
had
had
him
in
the
blue
room
two
days
ago
until
hyacinth
thought
that
perhaps
he
would
be
more
comfortable
in
the
purple
room
after
all
the
purple
room
has
the
best
view
said
wiggs
helpfully
and
it
gets
the
sun
wiggs
do
forget
to
put
some
flowers
there
and
have
you
given
him
any
books
i
gave
him
two
said
wiggs
for
and
animals
at
oh
i
sure
he
like
those
now
let
think
what
we
shall
do
when
he
comes
he
arrive
some
time
in
the
afternoon
naturally
he
will
want
a
little
refreshment
would
he
like
a
picnic
in
the
forest
asked
wiggs
i
do
think
any
one
wants
a
picnic
after
a
long
journey
i
picnics
yes
dear
but
you
see
prince
udo
much
older
than
you
and
i
expect
he
had
so
many
picnics
that
he
tired
of
them
i
suppose
really
i
ought
to
receive
him
in
the
throne
room
but
so
so
stuffy
said
wiggs
that
just
it
we
should
feel
uncomfortable
with
each
other
the
whole
time
i
think
i
shall
receive
him
up
here
i
never
feel
so
nervous
in
the
open
air
will
the
countess
be
here
asked
wiggs
no
said
the
princess
coldly
at
least
she
corrected
herself
she
will
not
be
invited
good
afternoon
countess
it
was
like
her
thought
hyacinth
to
arrive
at
that
very
moment
belvane
curtsied
low
good
afternoon
your
royal
highness
i
am
here
purely
on
a
matter
of
business
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
inform
your
royal
highness
of
the
result
of
the
literature
prize
she
spoke
meekly
and
as
one
who
forgave
hyacinth
for
her
unkindness
towards
her
certainly
countess
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
the
countess
unrolled
a
parchment
the
prize
has
been
won
she
said
by
she
held
the
parchment
a
little
closer
to
her
eyes
by
charlotte
patacake
oh
yes
who
is
she
a
most
deserving
woman
your
royal
highness
if
she
is
the
woman
thinking
of
a
most
deserving
person
to
whom
the
money
will
be
more
than
welcome
her
poem
shows
a
sense
of
values
combined
with
er
breadth
and
er
distance
such
as
i
have
seldom
seen
equalled
the
er
technique
is
only
excelled
by
the
shall
i
say
tempermentality
the
boldness
of
the
colouring
by
the
how
shall
i
put
it
the
firmness
of
the
outline
in
short
in
short
said
the
princess
you
like
it
your
royal
highness
it
is
unique
but
naturally
you
will
wish
to
hear
it
for
yourself
it
is
only
some
twelve
hundred
lines
long
i
will
declaim
it
to
your
royal
highness
she
held
the
manuscript
out
at
the
full
length
of
her
left
arm
struck
an
attitude
with
the
right
arm
and
began
in
her
most
thrilling
voice
merriwig
the
first
rode
out
to
war
many
other
kings
yes
countess
but
another
time
i
am
busy
this
afternoon
as
you
know
i
think
the
prince
udo
of
araby
arrives
and
belvane
lips
were
still
moving
and
her
right
arm
swayed
up
and
down
gladsome
cheers
assailed
the
balmy
air
she
murmured
to
herself
and
her
hand
when
up
to
heaven
come
from
north
from
she
pointed
in
the
directions
mentioned
everywhere
no
wight
that
stood
he
will
be
received
privately
up
here
by
myself
in
the
first
place
and
afterwards
gaze
upon
the
sight
unmoved
i
whispered
belvane
and
placed
her
hand
upon
her
breast
to
show
that
anyhow
it
had
been
too
much
for
do
they
march
so
i
beg
your
royal
highness
pardon
i
was
so
carried
away
by
this
wonderful
poem
i
do
beg
of
your
royal
highness
to
read
it
the
princess
waved
the
manuscript
aside
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
claims
of
literature
countess
and
i
shall
certainly
read
the
poem
another
time
meanwhile
i
can
i
hope
trust
you
to
see
that
the
prize
is
awarded
to
the
rightful
winner
what
i
am
telling
you
now
is
that
the
prince
udo
is
arriving
belvane
looked
innocently
puzzled
prince
udo
udo
would
that
be
prince
udo
of
carroway
your
royal
highness
a
tall
man
with
three
legs
prince
udo
of
araby
said
hyacinth
severely
i
think
i
have
already
mentioned
him
to
your
ladyship
he
will
make
a
stay
of
some
months
but
how
your
royal
highness
to
see
a
man
again
we
were
all
getting
so
dull
together
we
want
a
man
to
wake
us
up
a
little
do
we
wiggs
i
will
go
and
give
orders
about
his
room
at
once
your
royal
highness
you
will
wish
him
to
be
in
the
purple
room
of
course
that
settled
it
he
will
be
in
the
blue
room
said
hyacinth
decidedly
certainly
your
royal
highness
fancy
wiggs
a
man
again
i
will
go
and
see
about
it
now
if
i
may
have
your
royal
highness
leave
to
withdraw
a
little
mystified
by
belvane
manner
hyacinth
inclined
her
head
and
the
countess
withdrew
chapter
xi
watercress
seems
to
go
with
the
ears
wiggs
gave
a
parting
pat
to
the
tablecloth
and
stood
looking
at
it
with
her
head
on
one
side
now
then
she
said
have
we
got
everything
what
about
sardines
said
woggs
in
her
common
way
i
do
know
what
she
doing
in
this
scene
at
all
but
roger
scurvilegs
insists
on
it
i
do
think
a
would
like
said
wiggs
if
been
on
a
long
journey
i
sardines
it
a
very
long
journey
from
araby
is
it
awful
long
why
it
taken
him
nearly
a
week
perhaps
she
added
hopefully
he
had
something
on
the
way
perhaps
he
took
some
sandwiches
with
him
said
woggs
thinking
that
this
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do
what
do
you
think
he
be
like
woggs
woggs
though
for
a
long
time
like
the
king
she
said
only
different
she
added
as
an
afterthought
up
came
the
princess
for
the
fifth
time
that
afternoon
all
excitement
well
she
said
is
everything
ready
yes
your
royal
highness
except
woggs
and
me
did
quite
know
about
sardines
the
princess
laughed
happily
i
think
there
will
be
enough
there
for
him
it
all
looks
very
nice
she
turned
round
and
discovered
behind
her
the
last
person
she
wanted
to
see
just
then
curtsied
effectively
forgive
me
your
royal
highness
she
said
profusely
but
i
thought
i
had
left
charlotte
patacake
priceless
manuscript
up
here
no
evidently
i
was
mistaken
your
royal
highness
i
will
withdraw
your
royal
highness
as
i
know
your
royal
highness
would
naturally
wish
to
receive
his
royal
highness
alone
listening
to
this
speech
one
is
impressed
with
woggs
method
of
calling
everybody
mum
not
at
all
countess
said
hyacinth
coldly
we
would
prefer
you
to
stay
and
help
us
receive
his
royal
highness
he
is
a
little
late
i
think
belvane
looked
unspeakably
distressed
oh
i
do
that
nothing
has
happened
to
him
on
the
way
she
exclaimed
i
an
uneasy
feeling
that
something
may
have
occurred
illustration
hyacinth
gave
a
shriek
and
faltered
slowly
what
could
have
happened
to
him
asked
hyacinth
not
apparently
very
much
alarmed
oh
your
royal
highness
it
just
a
sort
of
silly
feeling
of
mine
there
may
be
nothing
in
it
there
was
a
noise
of
footsteps
from
below
a
man
voice
was
heard
the
princess
and
the
countess
both
extremely
nervous
but
from
entirely
different
reasons
arranged
suitable
smiles
of
greeting
upon
their
faces
wiggs
and
woggs
stood
in
attitudes
of
appropriate
meekness
by
the
table
the
court
painter
could
have
made
a
beautiful
picture
of
it
his
royal
highness
prince
udo
of
araby
announced
the
voice
of
an
attendant
a
nervous
moment
said
belvane
to
herself
can
the
ring
have
failed
to
act
udo
trotted
in
it
has
said
belvane
princess
hyacinth
gave
a
shriek
and
faltered
slowly
backwards
wiggs
who
was
familiar
with
these
little
accidents
in
the
books
which
she
dusted
and
woggs
who
had
a
natural
love
for
any
kind
of
animal
stood
their
ground
whatever
is
it
murmured
hyacinth
it
was
as
well
that
belvane
was
there
allow
me
to
present
to
your
royal
highness
she
said
stepping
forward
his
royal
highness
prince
udo
of
araby
prince
said
hyacinth
all
unwilling
to
believe
it
i
afraid
so
said
udo
gloomily
he
had
thought
over
this
meeting
a
good
deal
in
the
last
two
or
three
days
and
he
realised
now
that
he
had
underestimated
the
difficulties
of
it
hyacinth
remembered
that
she
was
a
princess
and
a
woman
i
delighted
to
welcome
your
royal
highness
to
euralia
she
said
wo
you
sit
down
i
mean
up
er
down
how
rabbits
sit
or
whatever
he
was
udo
decided
to
sit
up
thank
you
you
no
idea
how
difficult
it
is
to
talk
on
four
legs
to
somebody
higher
up
it
strains
the
neck
so
there
was
an
awkward
silence
nobody
quite
knew
what
to
say
except
belvane
she
turned
to
udo
with
her
most
charming
smile
did
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
she
asked
sweetly
no
said
udo
coldly
oh
do
tell
us
what
happened
to
you
cried
hyacinth
did
you
meet
some
terrible
enchanter
on
the
way
oh
i
am
so
dreadfully
sorry
when
one
is
not
feeling
very
well
there
is
a
certain
type
of
question
which
is
always
annoying
ca
you
what
happened
to
me
said
udo
crossly
i
know
it
happened
i
had
come
two
days
journey
from
araby
when
please
your
royal
highness
said
wiggs
is
this
tail
in
the
salt
she
took
it
out
gave
it
a
shake
and
handed
it
back
to
him
oh
thank
you
thank
you
two
days
journey
from
araby
when
i
woke
up
one
afternoon
and
found
myself
like
this
i
ask
you
to
imagine
my
annoyance
my
first
thought
naturally
was
to
return
home
and
hide
myself
but
i
told
myself
princess
that
wanted
me
the
princess
could
not
help
being
touched
by
this
said
as
it
was
with
a
graceful
movement
of
the
ears
and
a
caressing
of
the
right
whisker
but
she
wondered
a
little
what
she
would
do
with
him
now
that
she
had
got
him
er
what
you
put
in
belvane
kindly
knowing
how
men
are
always
glad
to
talk
about
themselves
udo
had
caught
sight
of
a
table
and
was
looking
at
it
with
a
curious
mixture
of
hope
and
resignation
very
very
hungry
he
said
speaking
with
the
air
of
one
who
knows
the
princess
whose
mind
had
been
travelling
woke
up
suddenly
oh
i
was
forgetting
my
manners
she
said
with
a
smile
for
which
the
greediest
would
have
forgiven
her
let
us
sit
down
and
refresh
ourselves
may
i
present
to
your
royal
highness
the
countess
belvane
do
i
shake
hands
or
pat
him
murmured
that
mistress
of
court
etiquette
for
once
at
a
loss
udo
placed
a
paw
over
his
heart
and
bowed
profoundly
charmed
he
said
gallantly
and
coming
from
a
cross
between
a
lion
a
rabbit
and
a
woolly
lamb
the
merest
suggestion
of
gallantry
has
a
most
pleasing
effect
they
grouped
themselves
round
the
repast
a
little
sherbet
your
royal
highness
said
hyacinth
who
presided
over
the
bowl
udo
was
evidently
longing
to
say
yes
but
hesitated
i
wonder
if
i
dare
it
very
good
sherbet
said
wiggs
to
encourage
him
i
sure
it
is
my
dear
but
the
question
is
do
i
like
sherbet
you
ca
help
knowing
if
you
like
do
bother
him
wiggs
said
hyacinth
a
venison
sandwich
dear
prince
the
question
is
do
i
like
venison
sandwiches
do
announced
woggs
to
any
one
who
was
interested
you
see
explained
udo
i
really
do
know
i
like
they
were
all
surprised
at
this
particularly
woggs
belvane
who
was
enjoying
herself
too
much
to
wish
to
do
anything
but
listen
said
nothing
and
it
was
the
princess
who
obliged
udo
by
asking
him
what
he
meant
it
was
a
subject
upon
which
he
was
longing
to
let
himself
go
to
somebody
well
he
said
expanding
himself
a
little
so
that
wiggs
had
to
remove
his
tail
this
time
from
the
custard
what
am
i
nobody
ventured
to
offer
an
opinion
am
i
a
hare
then
put
me
next
to
the
red
currant
jelly
or
whatever
it
is
that
hares
like
the
anxious
eye
of
the
hostess
wandered
over
the
table
am
i
a
lion
went
on
udo
developing
his
theme
then
pass
me
wiggs
oh
please
do
be
a
lion
said
wiggs
gently
as
she
stroked
his
mane
but
have
you
a
feeling
for
anything
asked
hyacinth
i
have
a
great
feeling
of
emptiness
i
yearn
for
only
i
do
quite
know
what
i
hope
it
is
sardines
whispered
wiggs
to
woggs
but
what
have
you
been
eating
on
the
way
asked
the
princess
oh
grass
and
things
chiefly
i
thought
i
should
be
safe
with
grass
and
were
you
er
safe
asked
belvane
with
a
great
show
of
anxiety
udo
coughed
and
said
nothing
i
know
it
silly
of
me
said
hyacinth
but
i
still
do
quite
understand
i
should
have
thought
that
if
you
were
a
a
quite
so
said
then
you
would
have
known
by
instinct
what
a
a
exactly
said
udo
likes
to
eat
ah
i
thought
you
think
that
that
just
what
i
thought
when
this
when
i
began
to
feel
unwell
but
i
worked
it
out
since
and
it
all
wrong
this
interesting
said
belvane
settling
herself
more
comfortably
go
on
well
when
he
coughed
and
looked
round
at
them
coyly
this
is
really
rather
a
delicate
subject
not
at
all
murmured
hyacinth
well
it
like
this
when
an
enchanter
wants
to
annoy
you
he
generally
turns
you
into
an
animal
of
some
kind
belvane
achieved
her
first
blush
since
she
was
seventeen
it
a
humorous
way
they
have
she
said
but
suppose
you
really
were
an
animal
altogether
it
would
annoy
you
at
all
an
elephant
is
annoyed
at
being
an
elephant
he
just
tries
to
be
a
good
elephant
and
he
be
miserable
if
he
could
do
things
with
his
trunk
the
annoying
thing
is
to
look
like
an
elephant
to
have
the
very
complicated
er
inside
of
an
elephant
and
yet
all
the
time
really
to
be
a
man
they
were
all
intensely
interested
woggs
thought
that
it
was
going
to
lead
up
to
a
revelation
of
what
sort
of
animal
prince
udo
really
was
but
in
this
she
was
destined
to
be
disappointed
after
all
there
were
advantages
in
udo
present
position
as
a
man
he
had
never
been
listened
to
so
attentively
now
suppose
for
a
moment
i
am
a
lion
i
have
the
er
delicate
apparatus
of
a
lion
but
the
beautiful
thoughts
and
aspirations
of
a
prince
thus
there
is
one
er
side
of
me
which
craves
for
raw
beef
but
none
the
less
there
is
a
higher
side
of
me
he
brought
his
paw
up
towards
his
heart
which
well
you
know
how
feel
about
it
yourself
the
princess
shuddered
i
she
said
with
conviction
belvane
was
interested
but
thought
it
all
a
little
crude
you
see
the
point
went
on
udo
a
baby
left
to
itself
does
know
what
is
good
for
it
left
to
itself
it
would
eat
anything
now
turn
a
man
suddenly
into
an
animal
and
he
is
in
exactly
the
same
state
as
that
baby
i
had
thought
of
it
like
that
said
hyacinth
i
to
think
of
it
now
let
us
proceed
further
with
the
matter
udo
was
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
he
had
not
had
such
a
time
since
he
had
given
an
address
on
beetles
to
all
the
leading
citizens
of
araby
at
his
suppose
again
that
i
am
a
lion
i
know
from
what
i
have
read
or
seen
that
raw
meat
agrees
best
with
the
lion
er
organisation
and
however
objectionable
it
might
look
i
should
be
foolish
not
to
turn
to
it
for
sustenance
but
if
you
do
quite
know
what
animal
you
supposed
to
be
see
how
difficult
the
problem
becomes
it
a
question
of
trying
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
in
order
to
find
out
what
agrees
with
you
his
eyes
took
on
a
faraway
look
a
look
in
which
the
most
poignant
memories
seem
to
be
reflected
i
been
experimenting
he
said
for
the
last
three
days
they
all
gazed
sadly
and
sympathetically
at
him
except
belvane
she
of
course
would
what
went
best
she
asked
brightly
oddly
enough
said
udo
cheering
up
a
little
banana
fritters
have
you
ever
kept
any
animal
who
lived
entirely
on
banana
fritters
never
smiled
the
princess
well
that
the
animal
i
probably
am
he
sighed
and
added
there
were
one
or
two
animals
i
was
for
a
little
while
he
seemed
to
be
revolving
bitter
memories
and
then
went
on
i
do
suppose
any
of
you
here
have
any
idea
how
very
prickly
thistles
are
when
they
are
going
down
er
may
i
try
a
watercress
sandwich
it
does
suit
the
tail
but
it
seems
to
go
with
the
ears
he
took
a
large
bite
and
added
through
the
leaves
i
hope
i
do
bore
you
princess
with
my
little
troubles
hyacinth
clasped
his
paw
impulsively
my
dear
prince
udo
i
only
longing
to
help
we
must
think
of
some
way
of
getting
this
horrible
enchantment
off
you
there
are
so
many
wise
books
in
the
library
and
my
father
has
composed
a
spell
which
oh
i
sure
we
shall
soon
have
you
all
right
again
udo
took
another
sandwich
very
good
of
you
princess
to
say
so
you
understand
how
annoying
a
little
indisposition
of
this
kind
is
to
a
man
of
my
temperament
he
beckoned
to
wiggs
how
do
you
make
these
he
asked
in
an
undertone
gracefully
undulating
belvane
rose
from
her
seat
well
she
said
i
must
go
and
see
that
the
stable
she
broke
off
in
a
pretty
confusion
how
of
me
i
mean
the
royal
apartment
is
prepared
have
i
your
royal
highness
leave
to
withdraw
she
had
and
wiggs
dear
you
too
had
better
run
along
and
see
if
you
can
help
you
may
leave
the
watercress
sandwiches
she
added
as
wiggs
hesitated
for
a
moment
with
a
grateful
look
at
her
royal
highness
udo
helped
himself
to
another
one
chapter
xii
we
decide
to
write
to
udo
father
now
my
dear
princess
said
udo
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
let
me
know
in
what
way
i
can
help
you
oh
prince
udo
said
hyacinth
earnestly
it
so
good
of
you
to
have
come
i
feel
that
this
this
little
accident
is
really
my
fault
for
having
asked
you
here
not
at
all
dear
lady
it
is
the
sort
of
little
accident
that
might
have
happened
to
anybody
anywhere
if
i
can
still
be
of
assistance
to
you
pray
inform
me
though
my
physical
powers
may
not
for
the
moment
be
quite
what
they
were
i
flatter
myself
that
my
mental
capabilities
are
in
no
way
diminished
he
took
another
bite
of
his
sandwich
and
wagged
his
head
wisely
at
her
let
come
over
here
said
hyacinth
she
moved
across
to
an
old
stone
seat
in
the
wall
udo
following
with
the
plate
and
made
room
for
him
by
her
side
there
is
of
course
a
way
of
indicating
to
a
gentleman
that
he
may
sit
next
to
you
on
the
chesterfield
and
tell
you
what
he
has
been
doing
in
town
lately
and
there
is
also
another
way
of
patting
the
sofa
for
fido
to
jump
up
and
hyacinth
achieved
something
very
tactful
in
between
and
udo
jumped
up
gracefully
now
we
can
talk
said
hyacinth
you
noticed
that
lady
the
countess
belvane
whom
i
presented
to
you
udo
nodded
what
did
you
think
of
her
udo
was
old
enough
to
know
what
to
say
to
that
i
hardly
looked
at
her
he
said
and
he
added
with
a
deep
bow
naturally
when
your
royal
highness
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
are
my
ears
in
your
way
it
all
right
said
hyacinth
rearranging
her
hair
well
it
was
because
of
that
woman
that
i
sent
for
you
but
i
ca
marry
her
like
this
your
royal
highness
hyacinth
turned
a
startled
face
towards
him
udo
perceived
that
he
had
blundered
to
hide
his
confusion
he
took
another
sandwich
and
ate
it
very
quickly
i
want
your
help
against
her
said
hyacinth
a
little
distantly
she
is
plotting
against
me
oh
your
royal
highness
now
i
see
said
udo
and
he
wagged
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
you
come
to
the
right
man
this
time
illustration
now
we
can
talk
said
i
do
trust
her
said
hyacinth
impressively
well
now
princess
i
not
surprised
i
tell
you
something
about
that
woman
oh
what
well
when
i
was
announced
just
now
what
happened
you
yourself
princess
were
not
unnaturally
a
little
alarmed
those
two
little
girls
were
surprised
and
excited
but
what
of
this
countess
belvane
what
did
do
what
she
do
nothing
said
udo
impressively
she
was
neither
surprised
nor
alarmed
why
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
believe
she
was
and
yet
said
udo
half
pathetically
half
proudly
princes
generally
look
like
this
now
why
was
she
surprised
hyacinth
looked
bewildered
did
she
know
you
were
sending
for
me
udo
went
on
yes
because
you
had
found
out
something
about
her
yes
then
depend
upon
it
done
it
a
mind
that
woman
must
have
but
how
could
she
do
it
exclaimed
hyacinth
of
course
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
she
do
if
she
could
udo
did
answer
he
was
feeling
rather
annoyed
with
belvane
and
had
got
off
his
seat
and
was
trotting
up
and
down
so
as
not
to
show
his
feelings
before
a
lady
how
she
do
it
implored
hyacinth
oh
she
in
with
some
enchanter
or
somebody
said
udo
impatiently
as
he
trotted
past
suddenly
he
had
an
idea
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
if
only
i
were
i
was
a
lion
he
tried
to
roar
exclaimed
hastily
that
it
was
only
a
practice
one
and
roared
again
no
i
do
think
i
a
lion
after
all
he
admitted
sadly
well
said
hyacinth
we
must
think
of
a
plan
we
must
think
of
a
plan
said
udo
and
he
came
and
sat
meekly
beside
her
again
he
could
conceal
it
from
himself
no
longer
that
he
was
not
a
lion
the
fact
depressed
him
i
suppose
i
have
been
weak
went
on
hyacinth
but
ever
since
the
men
went
away
she
has
been
the
ruling
spirit
of
the
country
i
think
she
is
plotting
against
me
i
she
is
robbing
me
i
asked
you
here
so
that
you
could
help
me
to
find
her
out
udo
nodded
his
head
importantly
we
must
watch
her
he
announced
we
must
watch
her
agreed
hyacinth
it
may
take
months
did
you
say
months
said
udo
turning
to
her
excitedly
yes
why
well
it
he
gave
a
deprecating
little
cough
i
know
very
silly
of
me
but
oh
well
let
hope
it
will
be
all
right
why
whatever
is
the
matter
udo
was
decidedly
embarrassed
he
wriggled
he
drew
little
circles
with
his
hind
paw
on
the
ground
and
he
shot
little
coy
glances
at
her
well
i
and
he
gave
a
little
nervous
giggle
i
have
a
sort
of
uneasy
feeling
that
i
may
be
one
of
those
animals
he
gave
another
conscious
little
laugh
that
have
to
go
to
sleep
all
through
the
winter
it
would
be
very
annoying
if
i
his
paw
became
very
busy
here
if
i
had
to
dig
a
little
hole
in
the
ground
just
when
the
plot
was
thickening
oh
but
you
wo
said
hyacinth
in
distress
they
were
both
silent
for
a
moment
thinking
of
the
awful
possibilities
udo
tail
had
fallen
across
hyacinth
lap
and
she
began
to
play
with
it
absently
anyway
she
said
hopefully
it
only
july
now
ye
es
said
udo
i
suppose
i
should
get
er
busy
about
november
we
ought
to
find
out
something
before
then
first
of
all
better
oh
he
started
up
in
dismay
i
just
had
a
thought
do
i
have
to
collect
a
little
store
of
nuts
and
things
surely
i
should
have
to
start
that
pretty
soon
said
udo
thoughtfully
you
know
i
should
be
very
handy
at
it
climbing
about
after
nuts
he
went
on
dreamily
what
a
life
for
a
oh
do
pleaded
hyacinth
surely
only
squirrels
do
that
yes
yes
now
if
i
were
a
squirrel
i
should
may
i
have
my
tail
for
a
moment
oh
i
so
sorry
said
hyacinth
very
much
confused
as
she
realised
the
liberty
she
had
been
taking
and
she
handed
his
tail
back
to
him
not
at
all
said
udo
he
took
it
firmly
in
his
right
hand
now
then
he
said
we
shall
see
watch
this
sitting
on
his
back
legs
he
arched
his
tail
over
his
head
and
letting
go
of
it
suddenly
began
to
nibble
at
a
sandwich
held
in
his
two
front
paws
a
pretty
picture
for
an
artist
but
a
bad
model
the
tail
fell
with
a
thud
to
the
ground
there
said
udo
triumphantly
that
proves
it
i
a
squirrel
oh
i
so
glad
said
hyacinth
completely
convinced
as
any
one
would
have
been
by
this
demonstration
yes
well
that
all
right
then
now
we
can
make
our
plans
first
of
all
we
better
he
stopped
suddenly
and
hyacinth
saw
that
he
was
gazing
at
his
tail
yes
she
said
encouragingly
he
picked
up
his
tail
and
held
it
out
in
front
of
him
there
was
a
large
knot
in
the
middle
of
it
now
have
i
forgotten
he
said
rubbing
his
head
thoughtfully
poor
hyacinth
oh
dear
prince
udo
i
so
sorry
i
afraid
i
did
that
without
thinking
udo
the
gallant
gentleman
was
not
found
wanting
a
lover
knot
he
said
with
a
graceful
incli
no
he
stopped
in
time
but
really
those
ears
of
his
made
ordinary
politeness
quite
impossible
oh
udo
said
hyacinth
impulsively
if
only
i
could
help
you
to
get
back
to
your
proper
form
again
yes
if
only
said
udo
becoming
practical
again
but
how
are
we
going
to
do
it
just
one
more
watercress
sandwich
he
said
apologetically
they
go
with
the
ears
so
well
i
shall
threaten
the
countess
said
hyacinth
excitedly
i
shall
tell
her
that
unless
she
makes
the
enchanter
restore
you
to
your
proper
form
i
shall
put
her
in
prison
udo
was
not
listening
he
had
gone
off
into
his
own
thoughts
banana
fritters
watercress
sandwiches
he
was
murmuring
to
himself
i
suppose
i
must
be
the
only
animal
of
the
kind
in
the
world
of
course
went
on
hyacinth
half
to
herself
she
might
get
the
people
on
her
side
the
ones
that
she
bribed
and
if
she
did
that
all
right
that
all
right
said
udo
grandly
leave
her
to
me
there
something
about
your
watercress
that
inspires
me
to
do
terrible
deeds
i
feel
a
new
whatever
i
am
one
gathers
reluctantly
from
this
speech
that
udo
had
partaken
too
freely
of
course
said
hyacinth
i
could
write
to
my
father
who
might
send
some
of
his
men
back
but
i
should
like
to
do
that
i
should
like
him
to
think
that
i
had
failed
him
extraordinary
how
i
take
to
these
things
said
udo
allowing
himself
a
little
more
room
on
the
seat
perhaps
i
am
a
rabbit
after
all
i
wonder
what
i
should
look
like
behind
wire
netting
he
took
another
bite
and
went
on
i
wonder
what
i
should
do
if
i
saw
a
ferret
i
suppose
you
have
got
a
ferret
on
you
princess
i
beg
your
pardon
prince
i
afraid
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
what
did
you
say
nothing
nothing
one
thoughts
run
on
he
put
his
hand
out
for
the
plate
and
discovered
that
it
was
empty
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
and
seemed
to
be
about
to
sink
into
slumber
when
his
attention
was
attracted
suddenly
by
the
knot
in
his
tail
he
picked
it
up
and
began
lazily
to
undo
it
i
wish
i
could
lash
my
tail
he
murmured
mine
seems
to
be
one
of
the
tails
that
do
lash
he
began
very
gingerly
to
feel
the
tip
of
it
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
sting
anywhere
he
closed
his
eyes
muttering
sting
countess
neck
sting
all
over
neck
sting
lots
stings
and
fell
peacefully
asleep
it
was
a
disgraceful
exhibition
roger
scurvilegs
tries
to
slur
it
over
talks
about
the
great
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
notorious
effect
of
even
one
or
two
watercress
sandwiches
on
an
empty
on
a
man
who
has
had
nothing
to
eat
for
several
days
this
is
to
palter
with
the
facts
the
effect
of
watercress
sandwiches
upon
udo
arrangements
however
furnished
we
have
all
just
seen
for
ourselves
but
what
roger
neglects
to
lay
stress
upon
is
the
fact
that
it
was
the
effect
of
or
watercress
sandwiches
there
is
no
denying
that
it
was
a
disgraceful
exhibition
if
i
had
been
there
i
should
certainly
have
written
to
his
father
about
it
hyacinth
looked
at
him
uneasily
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
sympathy
poor
fellow
she
thought
he
had
a
hard
time
lately
but
it
is
a
strain
on
the
sympathy
to
gaze
too
long
on
a
mixture
of
lion
rabbit
and
woolly
lamb
particularly
when
the
rabbit
part
has
its
mouth
open
and
is
snoring
gently
besides
what
could
she
do
with
him
she
had
two
of
them
on
her
hands
now
the
countess
and
the
prince
belvane
was
in
an
even
better
position
than
before
she
could
now
employ
udo
to
help
her
in
her
plots
against
the
princess
grant
to
me
so
and
so
or
i
keep
the
enchantment
for
ever
on
his
royal
highness
and
what
could
a
poor
girl
do
well
she
would
have
to
come
to
some
decision
in
the
future
meanwhile
the
difficulties
of
the
moment
were
enough
the
most
obvious
difficulty
was
his
bedroom
was
it
quite
the
sort
of
room
he
wanted
now
hyacinth
realised
suddenly
that
to
be
hostess
to
such
a
collection
of
animals
as
udo
was
would
require
all
the
tact
she
possessed
perhaps
he
would
tell
her
what
he
wanted
when
he
woke
up
better
let
him
sleep
peacefully
now
she
looked
at
him
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
and
went
quickly
down
into
the
palace
chapter
xiii
pink
rhymes
with
think
udo
awoke
slightly
refreshed
and
decided
to
take
a
firm
line
with
the
countess
at
once
he
had
no
difficulty
about
finding
his
way
down
to
her
the
palace
seemed
to
be
full
of
servants
all
apparently
busy
about
something
which
brought
them
for
a
moment
in
sight
of
the
newly
arrived
prince
and
then
whisked
them
off
hand
to
mouth
and
shoulders
shaking
by
one
of
these
with
more
control
over
her
countenance
than
the
others
an
annoyed
udo
was
led
into
belvane
garden
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
flagged
walk
between
her
lavender
hedges
and
as
he
came
in
she
stopped
and
rested
her
elbows
on
her
sundial
and
looked
mockingly
at
him
waiting
for
him
to
speak
between
the
showers
i
mark
the
hours
said
the
sundial
on
the
suggestion
of
belvane
one
wet
afternoon
but
for
the
moment
the
countess
was
in
the
way
ah
here
we
are
said
udo
in
rather
a
nasty
voice
here
we
are
said
belvane
sweetly
all
of
us
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
oh
prince
udo
she
said
you
be
the
death
of
me
count
me
as
one
more
of
your
victims
it
is
easy
to
be
angry
with
any
one
who
will
laugh
at
you
all
the
time
but
difficult
to
be
effective
particularly
when
but
we
need
not
dwell
upon
udo
handicap
again
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
he
said
stiffly
to
intelligent
people
the
outside
appearance
is
not
everything
but
it
can
be
very
funny
ca
it
said
belvane
coaxingly
i
wished
for
something
humorous
to
happen
to
you
but
i
never
thought
ah
said
udo
now
we
got
it
he
spoke
with
an
air
of
a
clever
who
has
skilfully
extracted
an
admission
from
a
reluctant
witness
this
sort
of
tone
goes
best
with
one
of
those
keen
legal
faces
perhaps
that
is
why
belvane
laughed
again
you
practically
confess
that
you
did
it
went
on
udo
magnificently
did
what
turned
me
into
a
a
a
rabbit
said
belvane
innocently
a
foolish
observation
like
this
always
pained
udo
what
makes
you
think
i
a
rabbit
he
asked
i
do
mind
what
you
are
but
you
never
dare
show
yourself
in
the
country
like
this
be
careful
woman
do
drive
me
too
far
beware
lest
you
rouse
the
lion
in
me
where
asked
belvane
with
a
air
with
a
gesture
full
of
dignity
and
good
breeding
udo
called
attention
to
his
tail
that
said
the
countess
is
not
the
part
of
the
lion
that
afraid
of
for
the
moment
udo
was
nonplussed
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
even
supposing
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
am
a
rabbit
i
still
have
something
up
my
sleeve
i
come
and
eat
your
young
carnations
belvane
adored
her
garden
but
she
was
sustained
by
the
thought
that
it
was
only
july
just
now
she
pointed
this
out
to
him
it
need
necessarily
be
carnations
he
warned
her
i
do
want
to
put
my
opinion
against
one
who
has
forgive
me
inside
knowledge
on
the
subject
but
i
think
i
have
nothing
in
my
garden
at
this
moment
that
would
agree
with
a
rabbit
i
do
mind
if
it
agree
with
me
said
udo
heroically
this
was
more
serious
her
dear
garden
in
which
she
composed
ruined
by
the
mastications
machinations
what
was
the
word
of
an
enemy
the
thought
was
unbearable
you
are
a
rabbit
she
said
hastily
you
are
really
a
rabbit
because
because
you
do
your
nose
properly
i
could
said
udo
simply
i
just
keeping
it
back
that
all
show
me
how
cried
belvane
clasping
her
hands
eagerly
together
it
was
not
what
he
had
come
into
the
garden
for
and
it
accorded
ill
with
the
dignity
of
the
royal
house
of
araby
but
somehow
one
got
led
on
by
this
wicked
woman
like
this
said
udo
the
countess
looked
at
him
critically
with
her
head
on
one
side
no
she
said
that
quite
wrong
naturally
i
a
little
out
of
practice
i
sorry
said
belvane
i
afraid
i
ca
pass
you
udo
could
think
what
had
happened
to
the
conversation
with
a
great
effort
he
extracted
himself
from
it
enough
of
this
countess
he
said
sternly
i
have
your
admission
that
it
was
you
who
put
this
enchantment
on
me
it
was
i
was
going
to
have
you
here
interfering
with
my
plans
your
plans
to
rob
the
princess
belvane
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
explain
the
principles
of
to
udo
there
will
always
be
men
like
udo
and
roger
scurvilegs
who
take
these
narrow
views
one
merely
wastes
time
in
arguing
with
them
my
plans
she
repeated
very
well
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
princess
and
she
will
unmask
you
before
the
people
belvane
smiled
happily
one
does
not
often
get
such
a
chance
and
who
she
asked
sweetly
will
unmask
your
royal
highness
before
the
people
so
that
they
may
see
the
true
prince
udo
underneath
what
do
you
mean
said
udo
though
he
was
beginning
to
guess
that
noble
handsome
countenance
which
is
so
justly
the
pride
of
araby
how
shall
we
show
that
to
the
people
they
form
such
a
mistaken
idea
of
it
if
they
all
see
you
like
this
wo
they
udo
was
quite
sure
now
that
he
understood
hyacinth
had
understood
at
the
very
beginning
illustration
forgot
his
manners
and
made
a
jump
towards
illustration
glided
gracefully
behind
the
sundial
in
a
pretty
affectation
of
you
mean
that
if
the
princess
hyacinth
falls
in
with
your
plans
you
will
restore
me
to
my
proper
form
but
that
otherwise
you
will
leave
me
like
this
one
actions
are
very
much
misunderstood
sighed
belvane
i
no
doubt
that
that
is
how
it
will
appear
to
future
historians
to
roger
certainly
it
was
too
much
for
udo
he
forgot
his
manners
and
made
a
jump
towards
her
she
glided
gracefully
behind
the
sundial
in
a
pretty
affectation
of
alarm
and
the
next
moment
udo
decided
that
the
contest
between
them
was
not
to
be
settled
by
such
methods
as
these
the
fact
that
his
tail
had
caught
in
something
helped
him
to
decide
belvane
was
up
to
him
in
an
instant
there
there
she
said
soothingly
let
undo
it
for
your
royal
highness
she
talked
pleasantly
as
she
worked
at
it
every
little
accident
teaches
us
something
now
if
you
been
a
rabbit
this
would
have
happened
no
i
not
even
a
rabbit
said
udo
sadly
i
just
nothing
belvane
stood
up
and
made
him
a
deep
curtsey
you
are
his
royal
highness
prince
udo
of
araby
your
royal
highness
straw
is
prepared
when
will
your
royal
highness
be
pleased
to
retire
it
was
a
little
unkind
i
think
i
should
not
record
it
of
her
were
not
roger
so
insistent
now
said
udo
and
lolloped
sadly
off
it
was
his
one
really
dignified
moment
in
euralia
on
his
way
to
his
apartment
he
met
wiggs
wiggs
he
said
solemnly
if
ever
you
can
do
anything
to
annoy
that
woman
such
as
making
her
an
bed
or
like
that
i
wish
you
do
it
whereupon
he
retired
for
the
night
into
the
mysteries
of
his
toilet
we
had
perhaps
better
not
inquire
as
the
chronicler
of
these
simple
happenings
many
years
ago
it
is
my
duty
to
be
impartial
these
are
the
facts
i
should
say
and
it
is
for
your
nobilities
to
judge
of
them
thus
and
thus
my
characters
have
acted
how
say
you
my
lords
and
ladies
i
confess
that
this
attitude
is
beyond
me
i
have
a
fondness
for
all
my
people
and
i
would
not
have
you
misunderstand
any
of
them
but
with
regard
to
one
of
them
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
say
anything
in
her
defence
about
her
at
any
rate
we
agree
i
mean
wiggs
we
take
the
same
view
as
hyacinth
she
was
the
best
little
girl
in
euralia
it
will
come
then
as
a
shock
to
you
as
it
did
to
me
on
the
morning
after
i
had
staggered
home
with
seventeen
volumes
to
learn
that
on
her
day
wiggs
could
be
as
bad
as
anybody
i
mean
really
bad
to
tear
your
frock
to
read
books
which
you
ought
to
be
dusting
these
are
accidents
which
may
happen
to
anybody
far
otherwise
was
wiggs
fall
she
adopted
in
fact
the
infamous
suggestion
of
prince
udo
three
nights
later
with
malice
aforethought
and
to
the
comfort
of
the
king
enemies
and
the
prejudice
of
the
safety
of
the
realm
she
made
an
bed
for
the
countess
it
was
the
most
perfect
bed
ever
made
cox
himself
could
not
have
improved
upon
it
newton
has
seen
nothing
like
it
it
took
wiggs
a
whole
morning
and
the
results
though
private
that
is
the
worst
of
an
bed
were
beyond
expectation
after
wrestling
for
half
an
hour
the
countess
spent
the
night
in
a
garden
hammock
composing
a
bitter
ode
to
melancholy
of
course
wiggs
caught
it
in
the
morning
the
countess
suspected
what
she
could
not
prove
wiggs
now
in
for
a
thoroughly
bad
week
realised
that
it
was
her
turn
again
what
should
she
do
an
inspiration
came
to
her
she
had
been
really
bad
the
day
before
it
was
a
pity
to
waste
such
perfect
badness
as
that
why
not
have
the
one
bad
wish
to
which
the
ring
entitled
her
she
drew
the
ring
out
from
its
round
her
neck
i
wish
she
said
holding
it
up
i
wish
that
the
countess
belvane
she
stopped
to
think
of
something
that
would
really
annoy
her
i
wish
that
the
countess
shall
never
be
able
to
write
another
rhyme
again
she
held
her
breath
expecting
a
thunderclap
or
some
other
outward
token
of
the
sudden
death
of
belvane
muse
instead
she
was
struck
by
the
extraordinary
silence
of
the
place
she
had
a
horrid
feeling
that
everybody
else
was
dead
and
realising
all
at
once
that
she
was
a
very
wicked
little
girl
she
ran
up
to
her
room
and
gave
herself
up
to
tears
may
you
dear
sir
or
madam
repent
as
quickly
however
this
is
not
a
moral
work
an
hour
later
wiggs
came
into
belvane
garden
eager
to
discover
in
what
way
her
inability
to
rhyme
would
manifest
itself
it
seemed
that
she
had
chosen
the
exact
moment
in
the
throes
of
composition
belvane
had
quite
forgotten
the
bed
so
absorbing
is
our
profession
she
welcomed
wiggs
eagerly
and
taking
her
hand
led
her
towards
the
roses
i
have
just
been
talking
to
my
dear
roses
she
said
listen
i
take
my
walks
about
like
to
see
the
roses
out
like
them
yellow
white
and
pink
crimson
are
the
best
i
butterfly
but
we
shall
never
know
about
the
butterfly
it
may
be
that
wiggs
has
lost
us
here
a
thought
on
lepidoptera
which
the
world
can
ill
spare
for
she
interrupted
breathlessly
when
did
you
write
that
i
was
just
making
it
up
when
you
came
in
dear
child
these
thoughts
often
come
to
me
as
i
walk
up
and
down
my
beautiful
garden
butterfly
but
wiggs
had
let
go
her
hand
and
was
running
back
to
the
palace
she
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
this
out
what
had
happened
that
it
was
truly
a
magic
ring
as
the
fairy
had
told
her
she
had
no
doubt
that
her
wish
was
a
bad
one
that
she
had
been
bad
enough
to
earn
it
she
was
equally
certain
what
then
had
happened
there
was
only
one
answer
to
her
question
the
bad
wish
had
been
granted
to
someone
else
to
whom
she
had
lent
the
ring
to
nobody
true
she
had
told
the
princess
all
about
it
but
suddenly
she
remembered
the
countess
had
had
it
in
her
hands
for
a
moment
yes
and
she
had
sent
her
out
of
the
room
and
so
many
thoughts
crowded
into
wiggs
mind
at
this
moment
that
she
felt
she
must
share
them
with
somebody
she
ran
off
to
find
the
princess
chapter
xiv
why
ca
you
be
like
wiggs
hyacinth
was
with
udo
in
the
library
udo
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
library
nowadays
for
surely
in
one
of
those
many
books
was
to
be
found
some
advice
to
a
gentleman
in
temporary
difficulties
suitable
to
a
case
like
his
hyacinth
kept
him
company
sadly
it
had
been
such
a
brilliant
idea
inviting
him
to
euralia
how
she
wished
now
that
she
had
never
done
it
well
wiggs
she
said
with
a
gentle
smile
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
the
morning
udo
looked
up
from
his
mat
and
nodded
to
her
i
found
out
said
wiggs
excitedly
it
was
the
who
did
it
udo
surveyed
her
with
amazement
the
princess
hyacinth
he
said
has
golden
hair
one
discovers
these
things
gradually
and
he
returned
to
his
book
wiggs
looked
bewildered
he
means
dear
said
hyacinth
that
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
countess
did
it
and
we
have
known
about
it
for
days
udo
wore
as
far
as
his
face
would
permit
the
slightly
puffy
expression
of
one
who
has
just
said
something
profoundly
ironical
and
is
feeling
about
it
oh
h
said
wiggs
in
such
a
disappointed
voice
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
hyacinth
like
the
dear
that
she
was
made
haste
to
comfort
her
we
did
really
she
said
we
only
guessed
it
but
now
that
you
have
found
out
i
shall
be
able
to
punish
her
properly
no
do
come
with
me
she
said
as
she
rose
and
moved
towards
the
door
stay
here
and
help
his
royal
highness
perhaps
you
can
find
the
book
that
he
wants
you
read
more
of
them
than
i
have
i
expect
left
alone
with
the
prince
wiggs
was
silent
for
a
little
looking
at
him
rather
anxiously
do
you
know
about
the
countess
she
asked
at
last
if
there
anything
i
do
know
it
must
be
bad
then
you
know
that
it
all
my
fault
that
you
are
like
this
oh
dear
prince
udo
i
am
so
dreadfully
sorry
what
do
you
mean
fault
because
it
was
my
ring
that
did
it
udo
scratched
his
head
in
a
slightly
puzzled
but
quite
a
nice
way
tell
me
all
about
it
from
the
beginning
he
said
you
have
found
out
something
after
all
i
believe
so
wiggs
told
her
story
from
the
beginning
how
the
fairy
had
given
her
a
ring
how
the
countess
had
taken
it
from
her
for
five
minutes
and
had
a
bad
wish
on
it
and
how
wiggs
had
found
her
out
that
very
morning
udo
was
intensely
excited
by
the
story
he
trotted
up
and
down
the
library
muttering
to
himself
he
stopped
in
front
of
wiggs
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
is
the
ring
still
going
he
asked
i
mean
can
you
have
another
wish
on
it
yes
just
one
then
wish
her
to
be
turned
into
a
he
tried
to
think
of
something
that
would
meet
the
case
what
about
a
spider
he
said
thoughtfully
but
that
a
wish
said
wiggs
yes
but
it
turn
oh
but
i
only
allowed
a
good
wish
now
she
added
rapturously
and
i
know
what
it
going
to
be
so
did
udo
at
least
he
thought
he
did
oh
you
dear
he
said
casting
an
affectionate
look
on
her
yes
that
it
that
i
might
be
able
to
dance
like
a
fairy
udo
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
and
they
were
adequate
enough
for
most
emergencies
but
how
is
that
going
to
help
he
said
tapping
his
chest
with
his
paw
but
it
ring
said
wiggs
and
so
of
course
i
going
to
wish
that
i
can
dance
like
a
fairy
i
always
meant
to
as
soon
as
been
good
for
a
day
first
the
child
was
absurdly
selfish
udo
saw
that
he
would
have
to
appeal
to
her
in
another
way
of
course
he
began
i
nothing
to
say
against
dancing
dancing
but
i
think
you
get
tired
of
it
just
as
i
shall
get
tired
of
lettuce
wiggs
understood
now
you
mean
that
i
might
wish
you
to
be
a
prince
again
well
said
udo
casually
it
just
occurred
to
me
as
an
example
of
what
might
be
called
the
good
wish
then
i
shall
never
be
able
to
dance
like
a
fairy
neither
shall
i
if
it
comes
to
that
said
udo
really
the
child
was
very
stupid
oh
it
too
cruel
said
wiggs
stamping
her
foot
i
did
so
want
to
be
able
to
dance
udo
glanced
gloomily
into
the
future
to
live
for
ever
behind
wire
netting
he
mused
to
be
eternally
frightened
by
ferrets
to
be
offered
wherever
one
visited
week
after
week
month
after
month
year
after
year
century
after
how
long
rabbits
live
but
wiggs
was
not
to
be
moved
i
give
up
my
wish
she
said
passionately
udo
got
on
to
his
four
legs
with
dignity
keep
your
wish
he
said
there
are
plenty
of
other
ways
of
getting
out
of
enchantments
i
learn
up
a
piece
of
poetry
by
our
court
poet
sacharino
and
recite
it
backwards
when
the
moon
is
new
something
like
that
i
can
do
this
quite
easily
by
myself
keep
your
wish
he
went
slowly
out
his
tail
looking
more
like
a
than
ever
followed
him
solemnly
the
fluffy
part
that
you
pull
was
for
a
moment
left
behind
then
with
a
jerk
it
was
gone
and
wiggs
was
left
alone
i
wo
give
up
my
wish
cried
wiggs
again
i
wish
it
now
before
i
sorry
she
held
the
ring
up
i
wish
that
she
stopped
suddenly
poor
prince
udo
he
seems
very
unhappy
i
wonder
if
it
a
good
wish
to
wish
to
dance
when
people
are
unhappy
she
thought
this
out
for
a
little
and
then
made
her
great
resolve
yes
she
said
i
wish
him
well
again
once
more
she
held
the
ring
up
in
her
two
hands
i
wish
she
said
that
prince
udo
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
it
was
no
good
her
wishing
her
good
wish
because
she
had
been
a
bad
girl
the
day
before
making
the
countess
an
bed
and
all
disgraceful
how
could
she
possibly
suppose
she
did
she
remembered
just
in
time
oh
bother
said
wiggs
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
ring
held
above
her
head
i
got
to
be
good
for
a
day
first
so
the
next
day
was
wiggs
good
day
the
legend
of
it
was
handed
down
for
years
afterwards
in
euralia
it
got
into
all
the
calendars
july
it
was
marked
with
a
red
star
in
portentous
volumes
it
had
a
chapter
devoted
to
it
there
was
some
talk
about
it
being
made
into
a
public
holiday
he
tells
us
but
this
fell
through
euralian
mothers
used
to
scold
their
naughty
children
with
the
words
why
ca
you
be
like
wiggs
and
the
children
used
to
tell
each
other
that
there
never
was
a
real
wiggs
and
that
it
was
only
a
story
for
parents
however
you
have
my
word
for
it
that
it
was
true
she
began
by
getting
up
at
five
in
the
morning
and
after
dressing
herself
very
neatly
and
being
particularly
careful
to
wring
out
her
sponge
she
made
her
own
bed
and
tidied
up
the
room
for
a
moment
she
thought
of
waking
the
in
the
palace
and
letting
them
enjoy
the
beautiful
morning
too
but
a
little
reflection
showed
her
that
this
would
not
be
at
all
a
kindly
act
so
having
dusted
the
throne
room
and
performed
a
few
simple
physical
exercises
she
went
outside
and
attended
to
the
smaller
domestic
animals
illustration
anybody
of
superior
station
or
age
came
into
the
room
she
rose
and
at
breakfast
she
had
three
helps
of
something
very
nutritious
which
the
countess
said
would
make
her
grow
but
only
one
help
of
everything
else
she
sat
up
nicely
all
the
time
and
never
pointed
to
anything
or
drank
with
her
mouth
full
after
breakfast
she
scattered
some
crumbs
on
the
lawn
for
the
robins
and
then
got
to
work
again
first
she
dusted
and
dusted
and
dusted
then
she
swept
and
swept
and
swept
then
she
sewed
and
sewed
and
sewed
when
anybody
of
superior
station
or
age
came
into
the
room
she
rose
and
curtsied
and
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
while
she
was
being
spoken
to
when
anybody
said
i
wonder
where
i
put
my
she
jumped
up
and
said
let
fetch
it
even
if
it
was
upstairs
after
dinner
she
made
up
a
basket
of
provisions
and
took
them
to
the
old
women
who
lived
near
the
castle
to
some
of
them
she
sang
or
read
aloud
and
when
at
one
cottage
she
was
asked
now
wo
you
give
me
a
little
dance
she
smiled
bravely
and
said
i
afraid
i
do
dance
very
well
i
think
that
was
rather
sweet
of
her
if
i
had
been
the
fairy
i
should
have
let
her
off
the
rest
of
the
day
when
she
got
back
to
the
palace
she
drank
two
glasses
of
warm
milk
with
the
skin
on
and
then
went
and
weeded
the
countess
lawn
and
once
when
she
trod
by
accident
on
a
bed
of
flowers
she
left
the
footprint
there
instead
of
scraping
it
over
hastily
and
pretending
that
she
had
been
near
the
place
as
you
would
have
done
and
at
six
she
kissed
everybody
including
udo
and
went
to
bed
so
ended
july
the
twentieth
perhaps
the
most
memorable
day
in
euralian
history
udo
and
hyacinth
spent
the
great
day
peacefully
in
the
library
a
gentleman
for
all
his
fur
udo
had
not
told
the
princess
about
refusal
to
help
him
besides
a
man
has
his
dignity
to
be
turned
into
a
mixture
of
three
animals
by
a
woman
of
thirty
and
to
be
turned
back
again
by
a
girl
of
ten
is
to
be
too
much
the
plaything
of
the
sex
it
was
time
he
did
something
for
himself
now
then
how
did
that
bit
of
sacharino
go
let
me
see
he
beat
time
with
a
paw
for
something
something
some
something
like
that
for
er
blood
for
er
no
gone
again
i
know
there
was
a
bit
of
blood
in
it
i
sure
you
get
it
soon
said
hyacinth
it
sounds
as
thought
it
going
to
be
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
wanted
oh
i
shall
get
it
all
right
some
of
the
words
have
escaped
me
for
the
moment
that
all
er
blood
you
must
have
heard
of
it
princess
it
about
blood
for
he
who
something
you
must
know
the
one
i
mean
i
know
i
heard
of
it
said
the
princess
wrinkling
her
forehead
only
i
ca
quite
think
of
it
for
the
moment
it
about
a
a
yes
that
it
said
udo
then
they
both
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
with
their
heads
on
one
side
and
murmured
to
themselves
but
noon
came
and
still
they
had
thought
of
it
after
a
simple
meal
they
returned
to
the
library
i
think
i
better
write
to
coronel
said
udo
and
ask
him
about
it
i
thought
you
said
his
name
was
sacharino
oh
this
is
not
the
poet
it
just
a
friend
of
mine
but
he
rather
good
at
this
sort
of
thing
the
trouble
is
that
it
takes
such
a
long
time
for
a
letter
to
get
there
and
back
at
the
word
letter
hyacinth
started
suddenly
oh
prince
udo
she
cried
i
can
never
forgive
myself
i
just
remembered
the
very
thing
father
told
me
in
his
letter
that
a
little
couplet
he
once
wrote
was
being
very
useful
for
er
removing
things
what
sort
of
things
said
udo
not
too
hopefully
oh
enchantments
and
things
udo
was
a
little
annoyed
at
the
and
things
as
those
turning
him
back
into
a
prince
again
was
as
much
in
the
day
work
as
removing
rust
from
a
helmet
it
goes
like
this
said
hyacinth
boll
bill
woll
will
it
sounds
as
though
it
would
remove
she
added
with
a
smile
udo
sat
up
rather
eagerly
i
try
he
said
is
there
any
particular
action
that
goes
with
it
i
never
heard
of
any
i
expect
you
ought
to
say
it
as
if
you
meant
it
udo
sat
up
on
his
back
paws
and
gesticulating
freely
with
his
right
paw
declaimed
boll
bill
woll
will
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
paws
waiting
for
the
transformation
he
waited
and
waited
nothing
happened
it
must
be
all
right
said
hyacinth
anxiously
because
i
sure
father
would
know
try
saying
it
more
like
this
she
repeated
the
lines
in
a
voice
so
melting
yet
withal
so
dignified
that
the
very
chairs
might
have
been
expected
to
get
up
and
walk
out
udo
imitated
her
as
well
as
he
could
at
about
the
time
when
wiggs
was
just
falling
asleep
he
repeated
it
in
his
fiftieth
different
voice
i
sorry
said
hyacinth
perhaps
it
is
so
good
as
father
thought
it
was
there
just
one
chance
said
udo
it
possible
it
may
have
to
be
said
on
an
empty
stomach
i
try
it
before
breakfast
upstairs
wiggs
was
dreaming
of
the
dancing
that
she
had
given
up
for
ever
and
what
belvane
was
doing
i
really
do
know
chapter
xv
there
is
a
lover
waiting
for
hyacinth
so
the
next
morning
before
breakfast
wiggs
went
up
on
to
the
castle
walls
and
wished
she
looked
over
the
meadows
and
across
the
peaceful
stream
that
wandered
through
them
to
the
forest
where
she
had
met
her
fairy
and
she
gave
a
little
sigh
dancing
she
said
and
then
she
held
the
ring
up
and
went
on
bravely
please
i
was
a
very
good
girl
all
yesterday
and
i
wish
that
prince
udo
may
be
well
again
for
a
full
minute
there
was
silence
then
from
the
direction
of
room
below
there
came
these
remarkable
words
the
beastly
stuff
away
and
bring
me
a
beefsteak
and
a
flagon
of
sack
between
smiles
and
tears
wiggs
murmured
he
all
right
i
g
glad
and
then
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
hurried
down
and
out
of
the
palace
away
away
from
udo
and
the
princess
and
the
countess
and
all
their
talk
to
the
cool
friendly
forest
there
to
be
alone
and
to
think
over
all
that
she
had
lost
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
forest
at
the
foot
of
her
own
favourite
tree
a
veteran
of
many
hundred
summers
who
stood
sentinel
over
an
open
glade
that
dipped
to
a
gurgling
brook
and
climbed
gently
away
from
it
she
sat
down
on
the
soft
green
yonder
she
might
have
danced
an
enchanted
place
and
now
never
never
never
how
long
had
she
sat
there
it
must
have
been
a
long
time
because
the
forest
had
been
so
quiet
and
now
it
was
so
full
of
sound
the
trees
were
murmuring
something
to
her
and
the
birds
were
singing
it
and
the
brook
was
trying
to
tell
it
too
but
it
would
keep
chuckling
over
the
very
idea
so
that
you
could
hardly
hear
what
it
was
saying
and
there
were
rustlings
in
the
grass
get
up
get
up
everything
was
calling
to
her
dance
dance
she
got
up
a
little
frightened
everything
seemed
so
strangely
beautiful
she
had
never
felt
it
like
this
before
yes
she
would
dance
she
must
say
thank
you
for
all
this
somehow
perhaps
they
would
excuse
her
if
it
was
not
very
well
expressed
this
will
just
be
for
you
she
said
as
she
got
up
i
shall
never
dance
again
illustration
then
she
and
then
she
danced
are
you
hyacinth
there
is
a
lover
waiting
for
you
somewhere
my
it
is
the
first
of
spring
the
blackbird
opens
his
yellow
beak
and
whistles
cool
and
clear
there
is
blue
magic
in
the
morning
the
sky
above
melts
into
white
where
it
meets
the
hills
the
wind
waits
for
you
up
yonder
will
you
go
to
meet
it
ah
stay
here
the
hedges
have
put
on
their
green
coats
for
you
misty
green
are
the
tall
elms
from
which
the
rooks
are
chattering
along
the
clean
white
road
between
the
primrose
banks
he
comes
will
you
be
round
this
corner
or
the
next
he
is
looking
for
you
hyacinth
she
rested
breathless
and
then
danced
again
it
is
summer
afternoon
all
the
village
is
at
rest
save
one
comes
from
the
deep
dark
trees
he
calls
again
and
flies
away
to
send
back
the
answer
the
fields
all
green
and
gold
sleep
undisturbed
by
the
full
river
which
creeps
along
them
the
air
is
heavy
with
the
scent
of
may
where
are
you
hyacinth
is
not
this
the
i
have
waited
for
you
so
long
she
stopped
and
the
watcher
in
the
bushes
moved
silently
away
his
mind
aflame
with
fancies
wiggs
went
back
to
the
palace
to
tell
everybody
that
she
could
dance
shall
we
tell
her
how
it
happened
said
udo
jauntily
i
just
recited
a
couple
of
lines
poetry
you
know
backwards
and
well
here
i
am
o
oh
said
wiggs
chapter
xvi
belvane
enjoys
herself
the
entrance
of
an
attendant
into
his
room
that
morning
to
bring
him
his
early
had
awakened
udo
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
jumped
up
shook
the
straw
from
himself
and
said
in
a
very
passion
of
longing
boll
bill
woll
will
he
felt
it
was
his
last
chance
exhausted
by
his
effort
he
fell
back
on
the
straw
and
dropped
asleep
again
it
was
nearly
an
hour
later
that
he
became
properly
awake
into
his
feelings
i
shall
not
enter
at
any
length
i
leave
that
to
roger
scurvilegs
between
ourselves
roger
is
a
bit
of
a
snob
the
degradation
to
a
prince
of
araby
to
be
turned
into
an
animal
so
ludicrous
the
delight
of
a
prince
of
araby
at
regaining
his
own
form
it
is
this
that
he
chiefly
dwells
upon
really
i
think
you
or
i
would
have
been
equally
delighted
i
am
sure
we
can
guess
how
udo
felt
about
it
he
strutted
about
the
room
he
gazed
at
himself
in
every
glass
he
held
out
his
hand
to
an
imaginary
hyacinth
with
ah
dear
princess
and
how
are
we
this
morning
never
had
he
felt
so
handsome
and
so
sure
of
himself
it
was
in
the
middle
of
one
of
his
pirouettings
that
he
caught
sight
of
the
unfortunate
and
uttered
the
remarkable
words
which
i
have
already
recorded
the
actual
meeting
with
hyacinth
was
even
better
than
he
had
expected
hardly
able
to
believe
that
it
was
true
she
seized
his
hands
impulsively
and
cried
oh
prince
udo
oh
my
dear
i
so
glad
udo
twirled
his
moustache
and
felt
a
very
gay
dog
indeed
at
breakfast
where
udo
did
himself
extremely
well
they
discussed
plans
the
first
thing
was
to
summon
the
countess
into
their
presence
an
attendant
was
sent
to
fetch
her
if
you
would
like
me
to
conduct
the
interview
said
udo
i
no
doubt
that
i
think
i
shall
be
all
right
now
that
you
are
with
me
i
sha
feel
so
afraid
of
her
now
the
attendant
came
in
again
her
ladyship
is
not
yet
down
your
royal
highness
tell
her
that
i
wish
to
see
her
directly
she
down
said
the
princess
the
attendant
withdrew
you
were
telling
me
about
this
army
of
hers
said
udo
one
of
my
ideas
i
had
a
good
many
while
i
was
er
in
retirement
was
that
she
could
establish
the
army
properly
at
her
own
expense
and
that
she
herself
should
be
perpetual
is
that
a
nice
thing
to
be
asked
hyacinth
innocently
it
a
thing
to
be
another
of
my
ideas
was
that
the
attendant
came
in
again
her
ladyship
is
a
little
indisposed
and
is
staying
in
bed
for
the
present
oh
did
her
ladyship
say
when
she
thought
of
getting
up
her
ladyship
did
seem
to
think
of
getting
up
at
all
her
ladyship
told
me
to
say
that
she
did
seem
to
know
she
get
up
again
the
attendant
withdrew
and
hyacinth
and
udo
standing
together
in
a
corner
discussed
the
matter
anxiously
i
do
quite
see
what
we
can
said
hyacinth
we
ca
her
out
of
bed
besides
she
may
really
be
supposing
she
stays
there
for
ever
of
course
said
udo
it
would
be
rather
you
see
if
we
we
might
possibly
morning
all
said
belvane
sweeping
into
the
room
she
dropped
a
profound
curtsey
to
the
princess
your
royal
highness
and
dear
prince
udo
looking
his
own
charming
self
again
she
had
made
a
superb
toilet
in
her
flowing
gold
brocade
cut
square
in
front
to
reveal
the
whitest
of
necks
with
her
black
hair
falling
in
two
braids
to
her
knees
and
twined
with
pearls
which
were
caught
up
in
loops
at
her
waist
she
looked
indeed
a
queen
while
hyacinth
and
udo
taken
utterly
by
surprise
seemed
to
be
two
conspirators
whom
she
had
caught
in
the
act
of
plotting
against
her
illustration
good
morning
said
i
i
thought
you
were
well
countess
said
hyacinth
trying
to
recover
herself
i
not
well
cried
belvane
clasping
her
hands
to
her
breast
i
thought
it
was
his
royal
highness
who
ah
but
he
looking
a
true
prince
now
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
and
there
was
in
that
look
so
much
of
admiration
humour
appeal
impudence
i
do
know
what
and
roger
can
not
tell
us
either
that
udo
forgot
entirely
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
could
only
gaze
at
her
in
wonder
her
mere
entry
dazzled
him
there
is
no
knowing
with
a
woman
like
belvane
and
i
believe
she
had
purposely
kept
herself
plain
during
these
last
few
days
so
that
she
might
have
the
weapon
of
her
beauty
to
fall
back
upon
in
case
anything
went
wrong
things
had
indeed
gone
wrong
udo
had
become
a
man
again
and
it
was
against
the
man
that
this
last
weapon
was
directed
udo
himself
was
only
too
ready
the
fact
that
he
was
once
more
attractive
to
women
meant
as
much
as
anything
to
him
to
have
been
attractive
to
hyacinth
would
have
contented
most
of
us
but
udo
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
with
her
he
could
not
forget
the
last
few
days
nor
the
fact
that
he
had
once
been
an
object
of
pity
to
her
now
belvane
had
not
pitied
him
hyacinth
had
got
control
of
herself
by
this
time
enough
of
this
countess
she
said
with
dignity
we
have
not
forgotten
the
treason
which
you
were
plotting
against
the
state
we
have
not
forgotten
your
base
attack
upon
our
guest
prince
udo
i
order
you
now
to
remain
within
the
confines
of
the
palace
until
we
shall
have
decided
what
to
do
with
you
you
may
leave
us
belvane
dropped
her
eyes
meekly
i
am
at
your
royal
highness
commands
i
shall
be
in
my
garden
when
your
royal
highness
wants
me
she
raised
her
eyes
gave
one
fleeting
glance
to
prince
udo
and
withdrew
a
hateful
woman
said
hyacinth
what
shall
we
do
with
her
i
think
said
udo
that
i
had
better
speak
to
her
seriously
first
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
can
drag
from
her
the
truth
of
her
conspiracy
against
you
there
may
be
others
in
it
in
which
case
we
shall
have
to
proceed
with
caution
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
just
misplaced
zeal
on
her
part
in
which
case
was
it
misplaced
zeal
which
made
her
turn
you
into
a
udo
held
up
his
hand
hastily
i
have
not
forgotten
that
he
said
be
sure
that
i
shall
exact
full
reparation
let
me
see
is
the
way
to
her
garden
hyacinth
did
not
know
quite
what
to
make
of
her
guest
at
the
moment
when
she
first
saw
him
in
his
proper
form
the
improvement
on
his
late
appearance
had
been
so
marked
that
he
had
seemed
almost
the
handsome
young
prince
of
her
dreams
every
minute
after
that
had
detracted
from
him
his
face
was
too
heavy
his
manner
was
too
pompous
one
of
these
days
he
would
be
too
fat
moreover
he
was
just
a
little
too
sure
of
his
position
in
her
house
she
had
wanted
his
help
but
she
did
not
want
so
much
of
it
as
she
seemed
to
be
likely
to
get
udo
feeling
that
it
was
going
to
be
rather
a
nice
day
went
into
belvane
garden
he
had
been
there
once
before
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
much
prettier
garden
this
morning
and
the
woman
who
was
again
awaiting
him
much
more
desirable
belvane
made
room
for
him
on
the
seat
next
to
her
this
is
where
i
sit
when
i
write
my
poetry
she
said
i
do
know
if
your
royal
highness
is
fond
of
poetry
extremely
said
udo
i
have
never
actually
written
any
or
indeed
read
much
but
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
those
who
er
admire
it
but
it
was
not
to
talk
about
poetry
that
i
came
out
here
countess
no
said
belvane
but
your
royal
highness
must
have
read
the
works
of
sacharino
the
famous
bard
of
araby
sacharino
of
course
for
something
something
he
who
something
i
mean
it
a
delightful
little
thing
everybody
knows
it
but
it
was
to
talk
about
something
very
different
that
i
for
blood
and
shoon
for
shoon
who
runs
may
read
my
rune
quoted
belvane
softly
it
is
perhaps
sacharino
most
perfect
gem
that
it
cried
udo
excitedly
i
knew
i
knew
it
if
only
i
could
he
broke
off
suddenly
remembering
the
circumstances
in
which
he
had
wanted
it
he
coughed
importantly
and
explained
for
the
third
time
that
he
had
not
come
to
talk
to
her
about
poetry
but
of
course
i
think
his
most
noble
poem
of
all
went
on
belvane
apparently
misunderstanding
him
is
the
ode
to
your
royal
highness
upon
your
let
me
see
how
does
it
begin
udo
so
dashing
and
bold
apparently
eighteen
years
is
eighteen
years
wonderful
born
in
the
palace
i
these
court
poets
said
udo
with
an
air
of
unconcern
flatter
one
of
course
if
he
expected
a
compliment
he
was
disappointed
there
i
can
not
judge
said
belvane
until
i
know
your
royal
highness
better
she
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eyes
is
your
royal
highness
very
dashing
i
er
well
er
one
that
is
to
say
he
waded
on
uncomfortably
feeling
less
dashing
every
moment
he
should
have
realised
at
once
that
it
was
an
impossible
question
to
answer
your
royal
highness
said
belvane
modestly
must
not
be
too
dashing
with
us
poor
euralians
for
the
fourth
time
udo
explained
that
he
had
come
there
to
speak
to
her
severely
and
that
belvane
seemed
to
have
mistaken
his
purpose
oh
forgive
me
prince
udo
she
begged
i
quite
thought
that
you
had
come
out
to
commune
soul
to
soul
with
a
of
the
beautiful
n
no
said
udo
not
exactly
then
what
is
it
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
eagerly
together
i
know
it
will
be
something
exciting
udo
stood
up
he
felt
that
he
could
be
more
severe
a
little
farther
off
he
moved
a
few
yards
away
and
then
turned
round
towards
her
resting
his
elbow
on
the
sundial
countess
he
began
sternly
ten
days
ago
as
i
was
starting
on
my
journey
hither
i
was
suddenly
just
a
moment
said
belvane
whispering
eagerly
to
herself
rather
than
to
him
and
she
jumped
up
with
a
cushion
from
the
seat
where
she
was
sitting
and
ran
across
and
arranged
it
under
his
elbow
he
would
have
been
uncomfortable
she
murmured
and
she
hurried
back
to
her
seat
again
and
sat
down
and
gazed
at
him
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
now
go
on
telling
me
she
said
breathlessly
udo
opened
his
mouth
with
the
obvious
intention
of
obeying
her
but
no
words
came
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
thread
of
his
argument
he
felt
a
perfect
fool
stuck
up
there
with
his
elbow
on
a
cushion
just
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
public
meeting
he
looked
at
his
elbow
as
if
he
expected
to
find
a
glass
of
water
there
ready
and
belvane
divined
his
look
and
made
a
movement
as
if
she
were
about
to
get
it
for
him
it
would
be
just
like
her
he
flung
the
cushion
from
him
oh
mind
my
roses
cried
belvane
and
came
down
angrily
to
her
belvane
looked
at
him
with
wide
innocent
eyes
you
you
oh
look
like
that
like
that
said
belvane
looking
like
it
again
do
it
shouted
udo
and
he
turned
and
kicked
the
cushion
down
the
flagged
path
stop
it
belvane
stopped
it
do
you
know
she
said
i
rather
frightened
of
you
when
angry
with
me
i
angry
very
very
angry
excessively
annoyed
i
thought
you
were
she
sighed
and
you
know
very
well
why
she
nodded
her
head
at
him
it
my
dreadful
temper
she
said
i
do
such
thoughtless
things
when
i
lose
my
temper
she
sighed
again
and
looked
meekly
at
the
ground
er
well
you
should
said
udo
weakly
it
was
the
slight
to
my
sex
that
made
me
so
angry
i
could
bear
to
think
that
we
women
could
rule
ourselves
for
such
a
short
time
and
that
a
man
had
to
be
called
in
to
help
us
she
looked
up
at
him
shyly
of
course
i
did
know
then
what
the
man
was
going
to
be
like
but
now
that
i
know
suddenly
she
held
her
arms
out
to
him
beseechingly
stay
with
us
prince
udo
and
help
us
men
are
so
wise
so
brave
so
so
generous
they
know
nothing
of
the
little
petty
feelings
of
revenge
that
women
indulge
really
countess
we
er
you
er
of
course
there
is
a
good
deal
in
what
you
say
and
i
er
wo
you
sit
down
again
prince
udo
udo
sat
down
next
to
her
and
now
said
belvane
let
talk
it
over
comfortably
as
friends
should
of
course
began
udo
i
quite
see
your
point
you
had
seen
me
you
did
know
anything
about
me
to
you
i
might
have
been
just
any
man
i
knew
a
little
about
you
when
you
came
here
beneath
the
er
outward
mask
i
saw
how
brave
and
dignified
you
were
but
even
if
i
could
have
got
you
back
into
your
proper
form
again
i
think
i
should
have
been
afraid
to
because
i
did
know
then
how
generous
how
forgiving
you
were
it
seemed
to
be
quite
decided
that
udo
was
forgiving
her
when
a
very
beautiful
woman
thanks
you
humbly
for
something
you
have
not
yet
given
her
there
is
only
one
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
do
udo
patted
her
hand
reassuringly
oh
thank
you
your
royal
highness
she
gave
herself
a
little
shake
and
jumped
up
and
now
shall
i
show
you
my
beautiful
garden
a
garden
with
you
in
it
dear
countess
is
always
beautiful
he
said
gallantly
and
it
was
not
bad
i
think
for
a
man
who
had
been
living
on
watercress
and
only
the
day
before
they
wandered
round
the
garden
together
udo
was
now
quite
certain
it
was
going
to
be
a
nice
day
it
was
an
hour
later
when
he
came
into
the
library
hyacinth
greeted
him
eagerly
well
she
said
udo
nodded
his
head
wisely
i
have
spoken
to
her
about
her
conduct
to
me
he
said
there
will
be
no
more
trouble
in
that
direction
i
fancy
she
explained
her
conduct
to
me
very
fully
and
i
have
decided
to
overlook
it
this
time
but
her
robberies
her
plots
her
conspiracy
against
udo
looked
blankly
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
pulled
himself
together
i
am
speaking
to
her
about
that
this
afternoon
he
said
chapter
xvii
the
king
of
barodia
drops
the
whisker
habit
king
merriwig
sat
in
his
tent
his
head
held
well
back
his
eyes
gazing
upwards
his
rubicund
cheeks
were
for
the
moment
a
snowy
white
a
hind
of
the
name
of
carlo
had
him
firmly
by
the
nose
yet
king
merriwig
neither
struggled
nor
protested
he
was
in
fact
being
shaved
the
court
barber
was
in
his
usual
conversational
mood
he
released
his
majesty
nose
for
a
moment
and
as
he
turned
to
sharpen
his
razor
remarked
terrible
war
this
terrible
agreed
the
king
do
seem
no
end
to
it
like
well
well
said
merriwig
we
shall
see
the
barber
got
to
work
again
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
to
the
king
of
barodia
if
i
had
him
here
merriwig
did
not
dare
to
speak
but
he
indicated
with
his
right
eye
that
he
was
interested
in
the
conversation
i
shave
his
whiskers
off
said
carlo
firmly
the
king
gave
a
sudden
jerk
and
for
the
moment
there
were
signs
of
a
battle
upon
the
snow
then
the
king
leant
back
again
and
in
another
minute
or
so
the
operation
was
over
it
will
soon
be
all
right
said
carlo
mopping
at
his
chin
your
majesty
should
have
moved
it
was
my
own
fault
carlo
you
gave
me
a
sudden
idea
that
all
you
welcome
your
majesty
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
the
king
took
out
his
tablets
on
these
he
was
accustomed
to
record
any
great
thoughts
which
occurred
to
him
during
the
day
he
now
wrote
in
them
these
noble
words
of
wisdom
may
fall
from
the
meanest
of
he
struck
a
gong
to
summon
the
chancellor
into
his
presence
i
have
a
great
idea
he
told
the
chancellor
the
chancellor
hid
his
surprise
and
expressed
his
pleasure
i
propose
to
pay
a
secret
visit
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
barodia
which
of
the
many
tents
yonder
have
my
spies
located
as
the
royal
one
the
big
on
in
the
centre
above
which
the
royal
arms
fly
i
thought
as
much
indeed
i
have
often
seen
his
majesty
entering
it
but
one
prefers
to
do
these
things
according
to
custom
acting
on
the
information
given
me
by
my
trusty
spies
i
propose
to
enter
the
king
of
barodia
tent
at
the
dead
of
night
and
the
chancellor
shuddered
in
anticipation
and
shave
his
whiskers
off
the
chancellor
trembled
with
delight
your
majesty
he
said
in
a
quavering
voice
forty
years
man
and
boy
have
i
served
your
majesty
and
your
majesty
late
lamented
father
and
never
have
i
heard
such
a
beautiful
plan
merriwig
struggled
with
himself
for
a
moment
but
his
natural
honesty
was
too
much
for
him
it
was
put
into
my
head
by
a
remark
of
my
court
barber
he
said
casually
but
of
course
the
actual
working
out
of
it
has
been
mine
jewels
of
wisdom
said
the
chancellor
sententiously
may
fall
from
the
meanest
of
hinds
i
suppose
said
merriwig
taking
up
his
tablets
and
absently
scratching
out
the
words
written
thereon
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
against
it
by
no
means
your
majesty
in
the
annuals
of
euralia
there
are
many
instances
of
humour
similar
to
that
which
your
majesty
suggests
humour
if
i
may
say
so
which
while
evidencing
to
the
ignorant
only
the
lighter
side
of
war
has
its
roots
in
the
most
fundamental
strategical
considerations
merriwig
regarded
him
with
admiration
this
was
indeed
a
chancellor
the
very
words
he
answered
which
i
said
to
myself
when
the
idea
came
to
me
fact
i
said
this
will
help
us
to
win
the
war
must
not
disguise
from
us
the
fact
that
the
king
of
barodia
will
look
extremely
funny
without
his
whiskers
i
shall
sally
forth
and
put
my
plan
into
practice
at
midnight
then
he
started
out
the
chancellor
awaited
his
return
with
some
anxiety
this
might
well
turn
out
to
be
the
decisive
stroke
or
strokes
of
the
war
for
centuries
past
the
ruling
monarchs
of
barodia
had
been
famous
for
their
ginger
whiskers
as
lost
as
the
king
of
barodia
without
his
whiskers
was
indeed
a
proverb
of
those
times
a
king
without
a
pair
and
at
such
a
crisis
in
his
fortunes
it
was
inconceivable
at
the
least
he
would
have
to
live
in
retirement
until
they
grew
again
and
without
the
leadership
of
their
king
the
barodian
army
would
become
a
rabble
the
chancellor
was
not
distressed
at
the
thought
he
was
looking
forward
to
his
return
to
euralia
where
he
kept
a
comfortable
house
it
was
not
that
his
life
in
the
field
was
uninteresting
he
had
as
much
work
to
do
as
any
man
it
was
part
of
his
business
for
instance
to
test
the
pretentions
of
any
new
wizard
or
who
was
brought
into
the
camp
such
and
such
a
quack
would
seek
an
interview
on
the
pretext
that
for
five
hundred
crowns
he
could
turn
the
king
of
barodia
into
a
small
black
pig
he
would
be
brought
before
the
chancellor
you
say
that
you
can
turn
a
man
into
a
small
black
pig
the
chancellor
would
ask
yes
your
lordship
it
came
to
me
from
my
grandmother
then
turn
me
the
chancellor
would
say
simply
the
wizard
would
try
as
soon
as
the
incantation
was
over
the
chancellor
surveyed
himself
in
the
mirror
then
he
nodded
to
a
couple
of
soldiers
and
the
impostor
was
tied
backwards
on
to
a
mule
and
driven
with
jeers
out
of
the
camp
there
were
many
such
impostors
who
at
least
made
a
mule
out
of
it
and
the
chancellor
life
did
not
lack
excitement
but
he
yearned
now
for
the
simple
comforts
of
his
home
he
liked
pottering
about
his
garden
when
his
work
at
the
palace
was
finished
he
liked
over
the
last
meal
of
the
day
to
tell
his
wife
all
the
important
things
he
had
been
doing
since
he
had
seen
her
and
to
impress
her
with
the
fact
that
he
was
the
holder
of
many
state
secrets
which
she
must
not
attempt
to
drag
from
him
a
woman
of
less
tact
would
have
considered
the
subject
closed
at
this
point
but
she
knew
that
he
was
only
longing
to
be
persuaded
however
as
she
always
found
the
secrets
too
dull
to
tell
any
one
else
no
great
harm
was
done
just
help
me
off
with
this
cloak
said
a
voice
in
front
of
him
the
chancellor
felt
about
until
his
hands
encountered
a
solid
body
he
undid
the
cloak
and
the
king
stood
revealed
before
him
thanks
well
i
done
it
it
went
to
my
heart
to
do
it
at
the
last
moment
so
beautiful
they
were
but
i
nerved
myself
to
it
poor
soul
he
slept
like
a
lamb
through
it
all
i
wonder
what
he
say
when
he
wakes
up
did
you
bring
them
back
with
you
asked
the
chancellor
excitedly
my
dear
chancellor
what
a
question
he
produced
them
from
his
pocket
in
the
morning
we
run
them
up
on
the
flagstaff
for
all
barodia
to
see
he
wo
like
that
said
the
chancellor
chuckling
i
do
quite
see
what
he
can
do
about
it
said
merriwig
the
king
of
barodia
did
quite
see
either
a
fit
of
sneezing
woke
him
up
that
morning
and
at
the
same
moment
he
felt
a
curious
draught
about
his
cheeks
he
put
his
hand
up
and
immediately
knew
the
worst
hullo
there
he
bellowed
to
the
sentry
outside
the
door
your
majesty
said
the
sentry
coming
in
with
alacrity
illustration
tent
seemed
to
swim
before
his
eyes
and
he
knew
no
the
king
bobbed
down
again
at
once
send
the
chancellor
to
me
said
an
angry
voice
from
under
the
bedclothes
when
the
chancellor
came
in
it
was
to
see
the
back
only
of
his
august
monarch
chancellor
said
the
king
prepare
yourself
for
a
shock
yes
sir
said
the
chancellor
trembling
exceedingly
you
are
about
to
see
something
which
no
man
in
the
history
of
barodia
has
ever
seen
before
the
chancellor
not
having
the
least
idea
what
to
expect
waited
nervously
the
next
moment
the
tent
seemed
to
swim
before
his
eyes
and
he
knew
no
more
when
he
came
to
the
king
was
pouring
a
jug
of
water
down
his
neck
and
murmuring
rough
words
of
comfort
in
his
ear
oh
your
majesty
said
the
poor
chancellor
your
majesty
i
know
what
to
say
your
majesty
he
mopped
at
himself
as
he
spoke
and
the
water
trickled
from
him
on
to
the
floor
pull
yourself
together
said
the
king
sternly
we
shall
want
all
your
wisdom
which
is
notoriously
not
much
to
help
us
in
this
crisis
your
majesty
who
has
dared
to
do
this
grievous
thing
you
fool
how
should
i
know
do
you
think
they
did
it
while
i
was
awake
the
chancellor
stiffened
a
little
he
was
accustomed
to
being
called
a
fool
but
that
was
by
a
man
with
a
terrifying
pair
of
ginger
whiskers
from
the
rather
fat
and
uninspiring
face
in
front
of
him
he
was
inclined
to
resent
it
what
does
your
majesty
propose
to
do
he
asked
shortly
i
propose
to
do
the
following
upon
you
rests
the
chief
burden
the
chancellor
did
not
look
surprised
it
will
be
your
part
to
break
the
news
as
gently
as
possible
to
my
people
you
will
begin
by
saying
that
i
am
busy
with
a
great
enchanter
who
has
called
to
see
me
and
that
therefore
i
am
unable
to
show
myself
to
my
people
this
morning
later
on
in
the
day
you
will
announce
that
the
enchanter
has
shown
me
how
to
defeat
the
wicked
euralians
you
will
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
this
victory
as
assured
by
him
involves
an
overwhelming
sacrifice
on
my
part
but
that
for
the
good
of
my
people
i
am
willing
to
endure
it
then
you
will
solemnly
announce
that
the
sacrifice
i
am
making
have
indeed
already
made
is
nothing
less
than
what
are
all
those
fools
cheering
for
out
there
a
mighty
roar
of
laughter
rose
to
the
sky
here
it
all
about
just
go
and
look
the
chancellor
went
to
the
door
of
the
tent
and
saw
he
came
back
to
the
king
striving
to
speak
casually
just
a
humorous
emblem
that
the
euralians
have
raised
over
their
camp
he
said
it
would
amuse
your
majesty
i
am
hardly
in
a
mood
for
joking
said
the
king
let
us
return
to
business
as
i
was
saying
you
will
announce
to
the
people
that
the
enormous
sacrifice
which
their
king
is
prepared
to
make
for
them
consists
of
there
they
go
again
i
must
really
see
what
it
is
just
pull
the
door
back
so
that
i
may
see
without
being
seen
it
it
really
would
amuse
your
majesty
are
you
implying
that
i
have
no
sense
of
humour
said
the
king
sternly
oh
no
sire
but
there
are
certain
jokes
jokes
in
the
poorest
of
taste
that
would
naturally
not
appeal
to
so
delicate
a
palate
as
your
majesty
this
er
strikes
me
as
one
of
them
of
that
i
am
the
best
judge
said
the
king
coldly
open
the
door
at
once
the
chancellor
opened
the
door
and
there
before
the
king
eyes
flaunting
themselves
in
the
breeze
beneath
the
royal
standard
of
euralia
waved
his
own
beloved
whiskers
the
king
of
barodia
was
not
a
lovable
man
and
his
daughters
were
decidedly
plain
but
there
are
moments
when
one
can
not
help
admiring
him
this
was
one
of
them
you
may
shut
the
door
he
said
to
the
chancellor
the
instructions
which
i
gave
to
you
just
now
he
went
on
in
the
same
cold
voice
are
cancelled
let
me
think
for
a
moment
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
his
apartment
you
may
think
too
he
added
kindly
if
you
have
anything
not
entirely
senseless
to
suggest
you
may
suggest
it
he
continued
his
pacings
suddenly
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
large
mirror
for
the
first
time
since
he
was
seventeen
he
had
seen
his
face
without
whiskers
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
his
reflection
he
beckoned
the
chancellor
to
approach
come
here
he
said
clutching
him
by
the
arm
you
see
that
he
pointed
to
the
reflection
that
is
what
i
look
like
the
mirror
has
made
a
mistake
of
any
kind
that
is
really
and
truly
what
i
look
like
yes
sire
for
a
little
while
the
king
continued
to
gaze
fascinated
at
his
reflection
and
then
he
turned
on
the
chancellor
you
coward
he
said
you
imitation
of
a
man
you
cringe
to
a
king
who
looks
like
that
why
you
ought
to
me
the
chancellor
remembered
that
he
had
one
kick
owing
to
him
he
drew
back
his
foot
and
then
a
thought
occurred
to
him
you
might
kick
me
back
he
pointed
out
i
certainly
should
said
the
king
the
chancellor
hesitated
a
moment
i
think
he
said
that
these
private
quarrels
in
the
face
of
the
common
enemy
are
to
be
deplored
the
king
looked
at
him
gave
a
short
laugh
and
went
on
walking
up
and
down
that
face
again
he
sighed
as
he
came
opposite
the
mirror
no
it
no
good
i
can
never
be
king
like
this
i
shall
abdicate
but
your
majesty
this
is
a
very
terrible
decision
could
not
your
majesty
live
in
retirement
until
your
majesty
had
grown
your
whiskers
again
surely
this
is
the
king
came
to
a
stand
opposite
him
and
looked
down
on
him
gravely
chancellor
he
said
those
whiskers
which
you
have
just
seen
fluttering
in
the
breeze
have
been
for
more
than
forty
years
my
curse
for
more
than
forty
years
i
have
had
to
live
up
to
those
whiskers
behaving
not
as
my
temperament
which
is
a
kindly
indeed
a
genial
one
bade
me
to
behave
but
as
those
whiskers
insisted
i
should
behave
arrogant
these
are
the
qualities
which
have
been
demanded
of
the
owner
of
those
whiskers
i
played
a
part
which
was
difficult
at
first
of
late
it
has
alas
been
more
easy
yet
it
has
never
been
my
true
nature
that
you
have
seen
he
paused
and
looked
silently
at
himself
in
the
glass
but
your
majesty
said
the
chancellor
eagerly
why
choose
this
moment
to
abdicate
think
how
your
country
will
welcome
this
new
king
whom
you
have
just
revealed
to
me
and
yet
he
added
regretfully
it
would
not
be
quite
the
same
the
king
turned
round
to
him
there
spoke
a
true
barodian
he
said
it
would
not
be
the
same
barodians
have
come
to
expect
certain
qualities
from
their
rulers
and
they
would
be
lost
without
them
a
new
king
might
accustom
them
to
other
ways
but
they
are
used
to
me
and
they
would
not
like
me
different
no
chancellor
i
shall
abdicate
do
not
wear
so
sad
a
face
for
me
i
am
looking
forward
to
my
new
life
with
the
greatest
of
joy
the
chancellor
was
not
looking
sad
for
him
he
was
looking
sad
for
himself
thinking
that
perhaps
a
new
king
might
like
changes
in
chancellors
equally
with
changes
in
manners
or
whiskers
but
what
will
you
do
he
asked
i
shall
be
a
simple
subject
of
the
new
king
earning
my
living
by
my
own
toil
the
chancellor
raised
his
eyebrows
at
this
i
suppose
you
think
said
the
king
haughtily
that
i
have
not
the
intelligence
to
earn
my
own
living
the
chancellor
with
a
cough
remarked
that
the
very
distinguished
qualities
which
made
an
excellent
king
did
not
always
imply
the
corresponding
er
and
so
on
that
shows
how
little
you
know
about
it
just
to
give
one
example
i
happen
to
know
that
i
have
in
me
the
makings
of
an
excellent
swineherd
a
swineherd
the
man
who
er
herds
the
swine
it
may
surprise
you
to
hear
that
posing
as
a
swineherd
i
have
conversed
with
another
of
the
profession
upon
his
own
subject
without
his
suspecting
the
truth
it
is
just
such
a
busy
outdoor
life
as
i
should
enjoy
one
herds
and
one
milks
and
one
milks
and
er
herds
and
so
it
goes
on
day
after
day
a
happy
smile
the
first
the
chancellor
had
ever
seen
there
spread
itself
over
his
features
he
clapped
the
chancellor
playfully
on
the
back
and
added
i
shall
simply
love
it
the
chancellor
was
amazed
what
a
story
for
his
when
the
war
was
over
how
will
you
announce
it
he
asked
and
his
tone
struck
a
happy
mean
between
the
tones
in
which
you
address
a
monarch
and
a
respectively
that
will
be
your
duty
now
that
i
have
shaken
off
the
curse
of
those
whiskers
i
am
no
longer
a
proud
man
but
even
a
swineherd
would
not
care
for
it
to
get
about
that
he
had
been
forcibly
shaved
while
sleeping
that
this
should
be
the
last
incident
recorded
of
me
in
barodian
history
is
unbearable
you
will
announce
therefore
that
i
have
been
slain
in
fair
combat
though
at
the
dead
of
night
by
the
king
of
euralia
and
that
my
whiskers
fly
over
his
royal
tent
as
a
symbol
of
his
victory
he
winked
at
the
chancellor
and
added
it
might
as
well
get
about
that
some
one
had
stolen
my
magic
sword
that
evening
the
chancellor
was
speechless
with
admiration
and
approval
of
the
plan
like
his
brother
of
euralia
he
too
was
longing
to
get
home
again
the
war
had
arisen
over
a
personal
insult
to
the
king
if
the
king
was
no
longer
king
why
should
the
war
go
on
i
think
said
the
future
swineherd
that
i
shall
send
a
note
over
to
the
king
of
euralia
telling
him
my
decision
when
it
is
dark
i
shall
steal
away
and
begin
my
new
life
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
the
people
should
not
go
back
to
their
homes
by
the
way
that
guard
outside
there
knows
that
i
was
killed
last
night
that
rather
awkward
i
think
said
the
chancellor
who
was
already
picturing
his
return
home
and
was
not
going
to
be
done
out
of
it
by
a
common
sentry
i
think
i
could
persuade
him
that
you
killed
last
night
oh
well
then
that
all
right
he
drew
a
ring
from
his
finger
perhaps
this
will
help
him
to
be
persuaded
now
leave
me
while
i
write
to
the
king
of
euralia
it
was
a
letter
which
merriwig
was
decidedly
glad
to
get
it
announced
bluntly
that
the
war
was
over
and
added
that
the
king
of
barodia
proposed
to
abdicate
his
son
would
rule
in
his
stead
but
he
was
a
harmless
fool
and
the
king
of
euralia
need
not
bother
about
him
the
king
would
be
much
obliged
if
he
would
let
it
get
about
that
the
whiskers
had
been
won
in
a
fair
fight
this
would
really
be
more
to
the
credit
of
both
of
them
personally
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
things
but
one
has
one
dignity
he
was
now
retiring
into
private
life
and
if
it
were
rumoured
abroad
that
he
had
been
killed
by
the
king
of
euralia
matters
would
be
much
more
easy
to
arrange
merriwig
slept
late
after
his
long
night
abroad
and
he
found
this
note
waiting
for
him
when
he
awoke
he
summoned
the
chancellor
at
once
what
have
you
done
about
those
er
trophies
he
asked
they
are
fluttering
from
your
flagstaff
sire
at
this
moment
ah
and
what
do
my
people
say
they
are
roaring
with
laughter
sire
at
the
whimsical
nature
of
the
jest
yes
but
what
do
they
say
some
say
that
your
majesty
with
great
cunning
ventured
privily
in
the
night
and
cut
them
off
while
he
slept
others
that
with
great
bravery
you
defeated
him
in
mortal
combat
and
carried
them
away
as
the
spoils
of
the
victor
oh
and
what
did
say
the
chancellor
looked
reproachful
naturally
your
majesty
i
have
not
spoken
with
them
ah
well
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
in
the
night
and
i
remember
now
that
i
kill
him
you
understand
your
majesty
skill
in
sword
play
will
be
much
appreciated
by
the
people
quite
so
said
the
king
hastily
well
that
all
i
getting
up
now
and
we
all
going
home
the
chancellor
went
out
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
chapter
xviii
the
veteran
of
the
forest
entertains
two
very
young
people
do
you
remember
the
day
when
the
princess
hyacinth
and
wiggs
sat
upon
the
castle
walls
and
talked
of
udo
coming
the
princess
thought
he
would
be
dark
and
wiggs
thought
he
would
be
fair
and
he
was
to
have
the
purple
room
or
was
it
the
blue
and
anyhow
he
was
to
put
the
countess
in
her
place
and
bring
happiness
to
euralia
that
seemed
a
long
time
ago
to
hyacinth
now
as
once
more
she
sat
on
the
castle
walls
with
wiggs
she
was
very
lovely
she
longed
to
get
rid
of
that
outside
help
in
our
affairs
which
she
had
summoned
so
recklessly
they
were
two
against
one
now
belvane
actively
against
her
was
bad
enough
but
belvane
in
the
background
with
udo
as
her
mouthpiece
udo
specially
asked
in
to
give
the
benefit
of
his
counsel
this
was
ten
times
worse
what
do
you
do
wiggs
she
asked
when
you
are
very
lonely
and
nobody
loves
you
dance
said
wiggs
promptly
but
if
you
do
want
to
dance
wiggs
tried
to
remember
those
dark
ages
about
a
week
ago
when
she
could
dance
i
used
to
go
into
the
forest
she
said
and
sit
under
my
own
tree
and
by
and
by
everybody
loved
you
i
wonder
if
they
love
of
course
they
would
shall
i
show
you
my
special
tree
yes
but
do
come
with
me
tell
me
where
it
is
i
want
to
be
unhappy
alone
so
wiggs
told
her
how
you
followed
her
special
path
which
went
in
at
the
corner
of
the
forest
until
by
and
by
the
trees
thinned
on
either
side
and
it
widened
into
a
glade
and
you
went
downhill
and
crossed
the
brook
at
the
bottom
and
went
up
the
other
side
until
it
was
all
trees
again
and
the
first
and
the
biggest
and
the
oldest
and
the
loveliest
was
hers
and
you
turned
round
and
sat
with
your
back
against
it
and
looked
across
to
where
you
come
from
and
then
you
that
everything
was
all
right
i
shall
find
it
said
hyacinth
as
she
got
up
thank
you
dear
she
found
it
she
sat
there
and
her
heart
was
very
bitter
at
first
against
udo
and
against
belvane
and
even
against
her
father
for
going
away
and
leaving
her
but
by
and
by
the
peace
of
the
place
wrapped
itself
around
her
and
she
felt
that
she
would
find
a
way
out
of
her
difficulties
somehow
only
she
wished
that
her
father
would
come
back
because
he
loved
her
and
she
felt
that
it
would
be
nice
to
be
loved
again
it
is
beautiful
is
it
said
a
voice
from
behind
her
she
turned
suddenly
as
a
tall
young
man
stepped
out
from
among
the
trees
oh
who
are
you
please
she
asked
amazed
at
his
sudden
appearance
his
dress
told
her
nothing
but
his
face
told
her
things
which
she
was
glad
to
know
my
name
he
said
is
coronel
it
is
a
pretty
name
yes
but
do
be
lead
away
by
it
it
belongs
to
nobody
very
particular
do
you
mind
if
i
sit
down
i
generally
sit
down
here
about
this
time
oh
do
you
live
in
the
forest
i
have
lived
here
for
the
last
week
he
gave
her
a
friendly
smile
and
added
you
late
are
you
late
yes
i
been
expecting
you
for
the
last
seven
days
how
did
you
know
there
was
any
me
at
all
smiled
hyacinth
with
a
movement
of
his
hand
coronel
indicated
the
scene
in
front
of
him
there
had
to
be
for
whom
all
this
was
made
it
wanted
somebody
to
say
thank
you
to
it
now
and
then
have
you
been
doing
that
all
this
week
me
i
would
presume
no
it
your
glade
and
you
neglected
it
shamefully
there
a
little
girl
who
comes
here
said
hyacinth
i
wonder
if
you
have
seen
her
coronel
turned
away
there
were
secret
places
in
his
heart
into
which
hyacinth
could
not
come
yet
she
danced
he
said
shortly
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
little
but
a
comfortable
silence
as
if
they
were
already
old
friends
you
know
said
hyacinth
looking
down
at
him
as
he
lay
at
her
feet
you
ought
not
to
be
here
at
all
really
i
wish
i
could
think
that
said
coronel
i
had
a
horrible
feeling
that
duty
called
me
here
i
love
those
places
where
one
really
ought
to
be
at
all
do
you
i
love
being
here
sighed
hyacinth
wiggs
was
quite
right
seeing
him
look
up
at
her
she
added
wiggs
is
the
little
girl
who
dances
you
know
she
would
be
right
said
coronel
looking
away
from
her
hyacinth
felt
strangely
rested
it
seemed
that
never
again
would
anything
trouble
her
never
again
would
she
have
only
her
own
strength
to
depend
upon
who
was
he
but
it
did
not
matter
he
might
go
away
and
she
might
never
see
him
again
but
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
world
i
thought
she
said
that
all
the
men
of
euralia
were
away
fighting
so
did
i
said
coronel
what
are
you
then
a
prince
from
a
distant
country
an
enchanter
a
spy
sent
from
barodia
a
travelling
musician
you
see
i
give
you
much
to
choose
from
you
leave
me
nothing
to
be
but
what
i
am
coronel
and
i
am
hyacinth
he
knew
of
course
but
he
made
no
sign
hyacinth
he
said
and
he
held
out
his
hand
coronel
she
answered
as
she
took
it
the
brook
chuckled
to
itself
as
it
hurried
past
below
them
hyacinth
got
up
with
a
little
sigh
of
contentment
well
i
must
be
going
she
said
must
you
really
be
going
asked
coronel
i
was
saying
you
know
illustration
turned
round
and
went
off
daintily
down
the
i
really
must
it
a
surprising
thing
about
the
view
from
here
said
coronel
that
it
looks
just
as
nice
about
the
same
time
that
a
very
extraordinary
thing
smiled
hyacinth
yes
but
it
one
of
those
things
that
you
do
want
to
take
another
person
word
for
you
think
i
ought
to
see
for
myself
well
perhaps
i
will
give
me
a
whistle
if
i
happen
to
be
passing
said
coronel
casually
and
tell
me
what
you
think
hyacinth
coronel
she
nodded
her
head
confidently
at
him
and
then
turned
round
and
went
off
daintily
down
the
hill
coronel
stared
after
her
what
udo
doing
he
murmured
to
himself
but
perhaps
she
does
like
animals
a
whole
day
to
wait
how
endless
if
he
had
known
that
udo
now
on
two
legs
again
was
at
that
moment
in
belvane
garden
trying
to
tell
her
for
the
fifth
time
that
week
about
his
early
life
in
araby
he
would
have
been
still
more
surprised
we
left
coronel
if
you
remember
in
araby
for
three
or
four
days
he
remained
there
wondering
how
udo
was
getting
on
and
feeling
more
and
more
that
he
ought
to
do
something
about
it
on
the
fourth
day
he
got
on
to
his
horse
and
rode
off
again
he
simply
must
see
what
was
happening
if
udo
wanted
to
help
then
he
would
be
there
to
give
it
if
udo
was
all
right
again
then
he
could
go
comfortably
back
to
araby
to
tell
the
truth
coronel
was
a
little
jealous
of
his
friend
a
certain
prince
perivale
who
had
stayed
at
his
uncle
court
had
once
been
a
suitor
for
hyacinth
hand
but
losing
a
competition
with
the
famous
bull
of
euralia
which
merriwig
had
arranged
for
him
had
made
no
further
headway
with
his
suit
this
prince
had
had
a
portrait
of
hyacinth
specially
done
for
him
by
his
own
court
painter
a
portrait
which
coronel
had
seen
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
had
at
first
objected
to
accompanying
udo
to
euralia
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
persuaded
himself
very
readily
that
the
claims
of
friendship
called
him
there
now
for
the
last
week
he
had
been
waiting
in
the
forest
now
that
he
was
there
he
was
not
quite
sure
how
to
carry
out
his
mission
so
far
there
had
been
no
sign
of
udo
either
on
four
legs
or
on
two
it
seemed
probable
that
unless
coronel
went
to
the
palace
and
asked
for
him
there
would
be
no
sign
and
if
he
went
to
the
palace
and
udo
was
all
right
and
the
princess
hyacinth
was
in
love
with
him
then
the
worst
would
have
happened
he
would
have
to
stay
there
and
help
admire
udo
an
unsatisfying
prospect
to
a
man
in
love
for
he
told
himself
by
this
time
that
he
was
in
love
with
hyacinth
although
he
had
never
seen
her
so
he
had
waited
in
the
forest
hoping
for
something
to
turn
up
and
first
wiggs
had
come
and
now
at
last
hyacinth
he
was
very
glad
that
he
had
waited
she
was
there
on
the
morrow
i
knew
you
come
said
coronel
it
looks
just
as
beautiful
does
it
i
think
it
even
more
beautiful
said
hyacinth
you
mean
those
little
white
clouds
that
was
my
idea
putting
those
in
i
thought
you
like
them
i
wondered
what
you
did
all
day
does
it
keep
you
very
busy
oh
said
coronel
i
have
time
for
singing
why
do
you
sing
because
i
am
young
and
the
forest
is
beautiful
i
have
been
singing
this
morning
too
why
asked
coronel
eagerly
because
the
war
with
barodia
is
over
oh
said
coronel
rather
taken
aback
that
does
interest
you
yet
if
you
were
a
euralian
but
it
interests
me
extremely
let
us
admire
the
scene
for
a
moment
while
i
think
look
there
is
another
of
my
little
clouds
coronel
wondered
what
would
happen
now
if
the
king
were
coming
back
then
udo
would
be
wanted
no
longer
save
as
a
suitor
for
hand
if
then
he
returned
it
would
show
that
but
suppose
he
was
still
an
animal
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
go
back
to
araby
as
an
animal
and
then
there
was
another
possibility
perhaps
he
had
never
come
to
euralia
at
all
here
were
a
lot
of
questions
to
be
answered
and
here
next
to
him
was
one
who
could
answer
them
but
he
must
go
carefully
a
hundred
he
said
aloud
there
i
finished
my
thinking
and
you
finished
your
looking
and
what
have
you
decided
smiled
hyacinth
decided
said
coronel
rather
startled
oh
no
i
was
deciding
anything
i
was
just
thinking
i
was
thinking
about
animals
so
was
i
how
very
curious
and
also
how
wrong
of
you
you
were
supposed
to
be
admiring
my
clouds
what
sort
of
animals
were
you
thinking
about
oh
all
sorts
i
was
thinking
about
rabbits
do
you
care
for
rabbits
at
all
not
very
much
neither
do
i
they
so
loppity
do
you
like
lions
i
think
their
tails
are
rather
silly
said
hyacinth
yes
perhaps
they
are
now
a
woolly
lamb
i
am
not
very
fond
of
woolly
lambs
just
now
no
well
they
not
very
interesting
it
a
funny
thing
he
went
on
casually
trying
to
steal
a
glance
at
her
that
we
should
be
talking
about
those
three
animals
because
i
once
met
somebody
who
was
a
mixture
of
all
three
together
at
the
same
time
so
did
i
said
hyacinth
gravely
but
he
saw
her
mouth
trembling
and
suddenly
she
turned
round
and
caught
his
eye
and
then
they
burst
out
laughing
together
poor
udo
said
coronel
and
how
is
he
looking
now
he
is
all
right
again
now
all
right
again
then
why
is
he
but
i
very
glad
he
is
i
did
like
him
said
hyacinth
blushing
a
little
and
then
she
went
on
bravely
but
i
think
he
found
he
did
like
me
first
he
wants
humouring
said
coronel
it
my
business
to
humour
him
it
is
yours
hyacinth
looked
at
him
with
a
new
interest
now
i
know
who
you
are
she
said
he
talked
about
you
once
what
did
he
say
asked
coronel
obviously
dying
to
know
he
said
you
were
good
at
poetry
coronel
was
a
little
disappointed
he
would
have
preferred
hyacinth
to
have
been
told
that
he
was
good
at
dragons
however
they
had
met
now
and
it
did
not
matter
princess
he
said
suddenly
i
expect
you
wonder
what
i
am
doing
here
i
came
to
see
if
prince
udo
was
in
need
of
help
and
also
to
see
if
you
were
in
need
of
help
prince
udo
was
my
friend
but
if
he
has
not
been
a
friend
of
yours
then
he
is
no
longer
a
friend
of
mine
tell
me
what
has
been
happening
here
and
then
tell
me
if
in
any
way
i
can
help
you
you
called
me
hyacinth
yesterday
she
said
and
it
is
still
my
name
hyacinth
said
coronel
taking
her
hand
tell
me
if
you
want
me
at
all
thank
you
coronel
you
see
coronel
it
like
this
and
sitting
beneath
wiggs
veteran
of
the
forest
with
coronel
lying
at
her
feet
she
told
him
everything
it
seems
easy
enough
he
said
when
she
had
finished
you
want
udo
pushed
out
and
the
countess
put
in
her
place
i
can
do
the
one
while
you
do
the
other
yes
but
how
do
i
push
prince
udo
out
that
what
going
to
do
yes
but
coronel
dear
if
i
could
put
the
countess
in
her
place
should
i
have
done
it
a
long
time
ago
i
do
think
you
quite
know
the
sort
of
person
she
is
and
i
do
quite
know
what
her
place
is
either
which
makes
it
rather
had
to
put
her
into
it
you
see
i
do
think
i
told
you
that
that
father
is
rather
fond
of
her
i
thought
you
said
udo
was
they
both
are
then
how
simple
we
simply
kill
udo
and
and
well
anyhow
one
part
of
it
done
yes
but
what
about
the
other
part
coronel
thought
for
a
moment
would
it
be
simpler
if
we
did
it
the
other
way
around
he
said
killed
the
countess
and
put
udo
in
his
place
father
would
like
that
at
all
and
he
coming
back
coronel
did
quite
see
the
difficulty
if
the
king
was
in
love
with
the
countess
he
would
marry
her
whatever
hyacinth
did
and
what
was
the
good
of
putting
her
in
her
place
for
one
day
if
her
next
place
was
to
be
on
the
throne
hyacinth
guessed
what
he
was
thinking
oh
do
you
see
she
cried
she
does
know
that
the
king
is
coming
back
and
if
i
can
only
just
show
her
i
do
mind
if
it
only
for
an
hour
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
her
and
that
she
has
got
to
take
her
orders
from
me
then
i
sha
mind
so
much
all
that
has
happened
these
last
weeks
but
if
she
is
to
have
disregarded
me
all
the
time
if
she
is
to
have
plotted
against
me
from
the
very
moment
my
father
went
away
and
if
nothing
is
to
come
to
her
for
it
but
that
she
marries
my
father
and
becomes
queen
of
euralia
then
i
can
have
no
pride
left
and
i
will
be
a
princess
no
longer
i
must
see
this
belvane
said
coronel
thoughtfully
oh
coronel
coronel
cried
hyacinth
if
fall
in
love
with
her
too
i
think
i
shall
die
of
shame
with
hyacinth
he
said
turning
to
her
in
amazement
yes
you
i
did
you
never
i
her
voice
trailed
away
she
could
not
meet
his
gaze
any
longer
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
the
next
moment
his
arms
were
round
her
and
she
knew
that
she
would
never
be
alone
again
chapter
xix
udo
behaves
like
a
gentleman
and
now
said
coronel
we
better
decide
what
to
do
but
i
do
mind
what
we
do
now
said
hyacinth
happily
she
may
have
the
throne
and
father
and
udo
and
and
anything
else
she
can
get
and
i
sha
mind
a
bit
you
see
i
have
got
now
coronel
and
i
can
never
be
jealous
of
anybody
again
that
what
makes
it
so
jolly
we
can
do
what
we
like
and
it
does
matter
if
it
does
come
off
so
just
for
fun
let
think
of
something
to
pay
her
out
i
feel
i
do
want
to
hurt
anybody
all
right
we
wo
hurt
her
we
humour
her
we
will
be
her
most
humble
obedient
servants
she
shall
have
everything
she
wants
including
prince
udo
smiled
hyacinth
that
a
splendid
idea
we
make
her
have
udo
it
will
annoy
your
father
but
one
ca
please
everybody
oh
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
they
got
up
and
wandered
back
along
wiggs
path
hand
in
hand
i
almost
afraid
to
leave
the
forest
said
hyacinth
in
case
something
happens
what
should
happen
i
do
know
but
all
our
life
together
has
been
in
the
forest
and
i
just
a
little
afraid
of
the
world
i
will
be
very
close
to
you
always
hyacinth
be
very
close
coronel
she
whispered
and
then
they
walked
out
together
if
any
of
the
servants
at
the
palace
were
surprised
to
see
coronel
they
did
not
show
it
after
all
that
was
their
business
prince
coronel
will
be
staying
here
said
the
princess
prepare
a
room
for
him
and
some
refreshment
for
us
both
and
if
they
discussed
those
things
in
the
servants
halls
of
those
days
as
why
should
they
not
no
doubt
they
told
each
other
that
the
princess
hyacinth
bless
her
pretty
face
had
found
her
man
at
last
why
you
only
had
to
see
her
looking
at
him
but
i
get
no
assistance
from
roger
at
this
point
he
pretends
that
he
has
a
mind
far
above
the
gossip
of
the
lower
orders
i
say
said
coronel
as
they
went
up
the
grand
staircase
i
am
not
a
prince
you
know
do
say
i
have
deceived
you
you
are
prince
said
hyacinth
proudly
my
dear
i
am
a
king
among
men
and
you
are
my
queen
but
that
in
our
own
special
country
of
two
if
you
are
so
particular
said
hyacinth
with
a
smile
father
will
make
you
a
proper
prince
directly
he
comes
back
will
he
that
what
i
wondering
you
see
he
does
know
yet
about
our
little
present
to
the
countess
but
it
is
quite
time
we
got
back
to
belvane
we
have
left
her
alone
too
long
it
was
more
than
udo
did
just
now
he
was
with
her
in
her
garden
telling
her
for
the
fifth
time
an
extraordinarily
dull
story
about
an
encounter
of
his
with
a
dragon
apparently
in
its
dotage
to
which
belvane
was
listening
with
an
interest
which
surprised
even
the
narrator
and
then
said
udo
i
jumped
quickly
to
the
right
and
whirling
my
no
wait
a
bit
that
was
later
i
jumped
quickly
to
my
left
yes
i
remember
it
now
it
my
left
i
jumped
quickly
to
my
left
and
whirling
my
he
stopped
suddenly
at
the
expression
on
belvane
face
she
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
something
behind
him
why
whoever
is
this
she
said
getting
to
her
feet
before
udo
had
completely
cleared
his
mind
of
his
dragon
the
princess
and
coronel
were
upon
them
ah
countess
i
thought
we
should
find
you
together
said
hyacinth
archly
let
me
present
to
you
my
friend
the
duke
coronel
coronel
this
is
countess
belvane
a
very
dear
and
faithful
friend
of
mine
prince
udo
of
course
you
know
his
royal
highness
and
the
countess
are
well
it
is
generally
known
at
present
so
perhaps
i
to
say
anything
coronel
made
a
deep
bow
to
the
astonished
belvane
illustration
me
present
to
you
my
friend
the
duke
your
humble
servant
he
said
you
will
i
am
sure
forgive
me
if
i
say
how
glad
i
am
to
hear
your
news
udo
is
one
of
my
oldest
friends
he
turned
and
clapped
that
bewildered
highness
on
the
back
are
you
udo
and
i
can
think
of
no
one
more
suitable
in
every
way
he
bowed
again
and
turned
back
to
the
prince
well
udo
you
looking
splendid
a
different
thing
countess
from
when
i
last
saw
him
let
me
see
that
must
have
been
just
the
day
before
he
arrived
in
euralia
ah
what
a
true
love
is
i
think
one
of
the
things
which
made
belvane
so
remarkable
was
that
she
was
never
afraid
of
remaining
silent
when
she
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
say
she
waited
therefore
while
she
considered
what
all
this
meant
who
coronel
was
what
he
was
doing
there
even
whether
a
marriage
with
udo
was
not
after
all
the
best
that
she
could
hope
for
now
meanwhile
udo
of
course
blundered
along
gaily
we
are
exactly
princess
i
mean
what
are
you
doing
here
coronel
i
did
know
princess
that
you
the
countess
and
i
were
just
having
a
little
i
was
just
telling
her
what
you
said
about
how
did
you
get
here
coronel
shall
we
tell
him
said
coronel
with
a
smile
at
hyacinth
hyacinth
nodded
i
rode
said
coronel
it
a
secret
he
added
but
i
did
know
that
you
we
find
that
we
have
really
known
each
other
a
very
long
time
explained
hyacinth
and
hearing
that
there
was
to
be
a
wedding
added
coronel
belvane
made
up
her
mind
coronel
was
evidently
a
very
different
man
from
udo
if
he
stayed
in
euralia
as
adviser
more
than
adviser
she
guessed
to
hyacinth
her
own
position
would
not
be
in
much
doubt
and
as
for
the
king
it
might
be
months
before
he
came
back
and
when
he
did
come
would
he
remember
her
but
to
be
queen
of
araby
was
no
mean
thing
we
did
want
it
to
be
known
yet
she
said
shyly
but
you
have
guessed
our
secret
your
royal
highness
she
looked
modestly
at
the
ground
and
feeling
for
her
reluctant
lover
hand
went
on
udo
and
i
here
she
squeezed
the
hand
and
finding
it
was
coronel
took
udo
boldly
without
any
more
maidenly
nonsense
udo
and
i
love
each
other
say
something
udo
prompted
coronel
er
yes
said
udo
very
unwillingly
and
deciding
he
would
explain
it
all
afterwards
whatever
his
feelings
for
the
countess
he
was
not
going
to
be
rushed
into
a
marriage
oh
i
so
glad
said
hyacinth
i
felt
somehow
that
it
must
be
coming
because
you
seen
so
of
each
other
lately
wiggs
and
i
have
often
talked
about
it
together
what
has
happened
to
the
child
thought
belvane
she
is
a
child
at
all
she
grown
up
there
no
holding
udo
once
he
begins
volunteered
coronel
the
most
desperate
lover
in
araby
my
father
will
be
so
excited
when
he
hears
said
hyacinth
you
know
of
course
that
his
majesty
comes
back
with
all
his
army
she
did
not
swoon
or
utter
a
cry
she
did
not
plead
the
vapours
or
the
megrims
she
took
unflinching
what
must
have
been
the
biggest
shock
in
her
life
then
perhaps
i
had
better
see
that
everything
is
ready
in
the
palace
she
said
if
your
royal
highness
will
excuse
me
and
with
a
curtsey
she
was
gone
coronel
exchanged
a
glance
with
hyacinth
i
enjoying
this
he
seemed
to
say
well
she
announced
i
must
be
going
in
too
there
be
much
to
see
about
coronel
was
left
alone
with
the
most
desperate
lover
in
araby
and
now
said
the
prince
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
here
coronel
put
his
arm
in
udo
and
walked
him
up
and
down
the
flagged
path
your
approaching
marriage
he
said
is
the
talk
of
araby
naturally
i
had
to
come
here
to
see
for
myself
what
she
was
like
my
dear
udo
she
charming
i
congratulate
you
do
be
a
fool
coronel
i
have
the
slightest
intention
of
marrying
her
then
why
have
you
told
everybody
that
you
are
going
to
you
know
quite
well
i
have
told
anybody
there
has
been
a
single
word
about
it
mentioned
until
you
pushed
your
way
in
just
now
ah
well
perhaps
you
had
heard
about
it
but
the
princess
knows
the
countess
knows
and
i
know
yes
i
think
you
may
take
our
word
for
it
that
it
true
i
have
the
slightest
intention
what
do
you
keep
clinging
to
my
arm
like
this
for
my
dear
udo
i
so
delighted
to
see
you
again
do
turn
your
back
on
old
friendships
just
because
you
have
found
a
nobler
and
a
truer
oh
very
well
if
you
going
to
drop
all
your
former
friends
go
on
then
but
when
married
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
understand
once
and
for
all
said
udo
angrily
that
i
am
getting
married
no
do
take
my
arm
we
can
talk
quite
well
like
this
i
am
sorry
udo
said
coronel
meekly
we
seem
to
have
made
a
mistake
but
you
must
admit
we
found
you
in
a
very
compromising
position
it
was
in
the
least
compromising
protested
udo
indignantly
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
just
telling
her
about
that
dragon
i
killed
in
araby
last
year
ah
and
who
would
listen
to
a
hopeless
story
like
that
but
the
woman
one
was
going
to
marry
once
more
i
am
not
going
to
marry
her
well
you
must
please
yourself
but
you
have
compromised
her
severely
with
that
story
poor
innocent
girl
well
let
forget
about
it
and
now
tell
me
how
do
you
like
euralia
i
am
returning
to
araby
this
afternoon
said
udo
stiffly
well
perhaps
you
right
i
hope
that
nothing
will
happen
to
you
on
the
way
udo
who
was
about
to
enter
the
palace
turned
round
with
a
startled
look
what
do
you
mean
well
something
happened
on
the
way
here
by
the
by
how
did
that
happen
you
never
told
me
your
precious
countess
whom
you
expect
me
to
marry
how
very
unkind
of
her
a
nasty
person
to
annoy
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
added
thoughtfully
i
suppose
it
rather
annoying
to
think
you
going
to
marry
somebody
whom
you
love
very
much
and
then
find
you
not
going
to
udo
evidently
had
thought
of
this
he
tried
to
show
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
frightened
she
could
do
anything
it
was
only
by
a
lucky
chance
she
did
it
last
time
yes
but
of
course
the
chance
might
come
again
you
have
the
thing
hanging
over
you
always
she
clever
you
know
and
i
should
never
feel
quite
safe
if
she
were
my
enemy
lovely
flowers
they
what
the
name
of
this
one
udo
dropped
undecidedly
into
a
seat
this
wanted
thinking
out
the
countess
what
was
wrong
with
her
after
all
and
she
evidently
adored
him
of
course
that
was
not
surprising
the
question
was
was
it
fair
to
disappoint
one
who
had
perhaps
some
little
grounds
for
after
all
he
had
been
no
more
gallant
than
was
customary
from
a
prince
and
a
gentleman
to
a
beautiful
woman
it
was
her
own
fault
if
she
had
mistaken
his
intentions
of
course
he
ought
to
have
left
euralia
long
ago
but
he
had
stayed
on
and
well
decidedly
she
was
beautiful
perhaps
he
had
paid
rather
too
much
attention
to
that
and
he
had
certainly
neglected
the
princess
a
little
after
all
again
why
not
marry
the
countess
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
there
was
anything
in
coronel
nonsense
but
one
never
knew
not
that
he
was
marrying
her
out
of
fear
no
certainly
not
it
was
simply
a
chivalrous
whim
on
his
part
the
poor
woman
had
misunderstood
him
and
she
should
not
be
disappointed
she
seems
fond
of
flowers
said
coronel
you
ought
to
make
the
palace
garden
look
beautiful
between
you
now
understand
clearly
coronel
i
not
in
the
least
frightened
by
the
countess
my
dear
udo
what
a
speech
for
a
lover
of
course
you
not
after
all
what
you
bore
with
such
patience
and
dignity
once
you
can
bear
again
that
subject
is
distasteful
to
me
i
must
ask
you
not
to
refer
to
it
if
i
marry
the
countess
you
be
a
very
lucky
man
put
in
coronel
i
happen
to
know
that
the
king
of
euralia
however
she
chosen
you
it
seems
personally
i
ca
make
out
what
she
sees
in
you
what
is
it
i
should
have
thought
it
was
quite
obvious
said
udo
with
dignity
well
coronel
i
think
perhaps
you
are
right
and
that
it
my
duty
to
marry
her
coronel
shook
him
solemnly
by
the
hand
i
congratulate
your
royal
highness
i
will
announce
your
decision
to
the
princess
she
will
be
much
amu
much
delighted
and
he
turned
into
the
palace
pity
him
you
lovers
he
had
not
seen
hyacinth
for
nearly
ten
minutes
chapter
xx
coronel
knows
a
good
story
when
he
hears
it
i
quote
with
slight
alterations
from
an
epic
by
charlotte
patacake
a
contemporary
poet
of
the
country
merriwig
the
first
rode
back
from
war
many
other
kings
had
done
before
hundred
men
behind
him
were
in
so
far
as
is
known
this
was
her
only
work
but
she
built
up
some
reputation
on
it
and
belvane
who
was
a
good
judge
had
a
high
opinion
of
her
genius
to
be
exact
there
were
only
four
hundred
and
men
henry
smallnose
a
bowman
of
considerable
promise
had
been
left
behind
in
the
enemy
country
the
one
casualty
of
war
while
spying
out
the
land
in
the
early
days
of
the
invasion
he
had
been
discovered
by
the
chief
armourer
of
barodia
at
full
length
on
the
wet
grass
searching
for
tracks
the
chief
armourer
a
kindly
man
had
invited
him
to
his
cottage
dried
him
and
given
him
a
warming
drink
and
had
told
him
that
if
ever
his
spying
took
him
that
way
again
he
was
not
to
stand
on
ceremony
but
come
in
and
pay
him
a
visit
henry
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
chief
armourer
daughter
had
accepted
without
any
false
pride
and
had
frequently
dropped
in
to
supper
thereafter
now
that
the
war
was
over
he
found
that
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
with
king
merriwig
permission
he
was
settling
in
barodia
and
with
the
chief
armourer
permission
he
was
starting
on
his
new
life
as
a
married
man
as
the
towers
of
the
castle
came
in
sight
merriwig
drew
a
deep
breath
of
happiness
home
again
the
hardships
of
the
war
were
over
the
spoils
of
victory
wrapped
up
in
tissue
paper
were
in
his
pocket
days
of
honoured
leisure
were
waiting
for
him
he
gazed
at
each
remembered
landmark
of
his
own
beloved
country
his
heart
overflowing
with
thankfulness
never
again
would
he
leave
euralia
how
good
to
see
hyacinth
again
poor
little
hyacinth
left
all
alone
but
there
she
had
had
the
countess
belvane
a
woman
of
great
experience
to
help
her
belvane
should
he
risk
it
how
much
had
she
thought
of
him
while
he
was
away
hyacinth
would
be
growing
up
and
getting
married
soon
life
would
be
lonely
in
euralia
then
unless
should
he
risk
it
what
would
hyacinth
say
she
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
gates
of
the
castle
she
had
wanted
coronel
to
wait
with
her
but
he
had
refused
illustration
the
towers
of
the
castle
came
in
sight
merriwig
drew
a
deep
breath
of
we
must
offer
the
good
news
to
him
gradually
he
said
when
a
man
has
just
come
back
from
a
successful
campaign
he
does
want
to
find
a
surprise
like
this
waiting
for
him
just
think
we
do
even
know
why
the
war
is
over
he
must
be
longing
to
tell
you
that
oh
have
a
hundred
things
to
tell
you
first
but
then
when
he
says
what
been
happening
here
while
i
been
away
nothing
much
i
suppose
then
you
can
say
then
i
shall
say
much
only
coronel
and
such
a
clever
oh
i
have
my
ideas
said
coronel
well
i
be
out
of
the
way
somewhere
i
think
i
go
for
a
walk
in
the
forest
or
shall
i
stay
here
in
the
countess
garden
and
amuse
myself
with
udo
anyhow
i
give
you
an
hour
alone
together
first
the
cavalcade
drew
up
in
front
of
the
castle
handkerchiefs
fluttered
to
them
from
the
walls
trumpets
were
blown
hounds
bayed
down
the
steps
came
hyacinth
all
blue
and
gold
and
flung
herself
into
her
father
arms
my
dear
child
said
merriwig
as
he
patted
her
soothingly
there
there
it
your
old
father
come
back
again
there
there
he
patted
her
again
as
though
it
were
she
and
not
himself
who
was
in
danger
of
breaking
down
my
little
hyacinth
my
own
little
girl
oh
father
i
glad
to
have
you
back
there
there
my
child
now
i
must
just
say
a
few
words
to
my
men
and
then
we
can
tell
each
other
all
that
has
been
happening
he
took
a
step
forward
and
addressed
his
troops
men
of
euralia
we
have
returned
from
a
long
and
arduous
conflict
to
the
embraces
of
our
mothers
and
wives
and
daughters
as
the
case
may
be
in
honour
of
our
great
victory
i
decree
that
from
now
onwards
shall
be
observed
as
a
holiday
throughout
euralia
i
bid
you
all
now
return
to
your
homes
and
i
hope
that
you
will
find
as
warm
a
welcome
there
as
i
have
found
in
mine
here
he
turned
and
embraced
his
daughter
again
and
if
his
eye
travelled
over
her
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
belvane
garden
it
is
a
small
matter
and
one
for
which
the
architect
of
the
castle
no
doubt
was
principally
to
blame
there
was
another
storm
of
cheers
the
of
euralia
ho
merriwig
was
shouted
from
five
hundred
throats
and
the
men
dispersed
happily
to
their
homes
hyacinth
and
merriwig
went
into
the
palace
now
father
said
hyacinth
later
on
when
merriwig
had
changed
his
clothes
and
refreshed
himself
you
got
to
tell
me
all
about
it
i
can
hardly
believe
it
really
over
yes
yes
it
all
over
said
merriwig
heartily
we
sha
have
any
trouble
in
direction
again
i
fancy
do
tell
me
did
the
king
of
barodia
apologise
he
did
better
than
that
he
abdicated
why
well
said
merriwig
remembering
just
in
time
i
er
killed
him
oh
father
how
rough
of
you
i
do
think
it
hurt
him
very
much
my
dear
it
was
more
a
shock
to
his
feelings
than
anything
else
see
i
have
brought
these
home
for
you
he
produced
from
his
pocket
a
small
packet
in
tissue
paper
oh
how
exciting
whatever
can
it
be
merriwig
unwrapped
the
paper
and
disclosed
a
couple
of
ginger
whiskers
neatly
tied
up
with
blue
ribbon
father
he
picked
out
the
left
one
et
if
he
had
known
any
latin
of
the
war
and
held
it
up
for
hyacinth
inspection
there
you
can
see
the
place
where
henry
smallnose
arrow
bent
it
by
the
way
he
added
henry
is
marrying
and
settling
down
in
barodia
it
is
curious
he
went
on
how
after
a
war
one
thoughts
turn
to
matrimony
he
glanced
at
his
daughter
to
see
how
she
would
take
this
but
she
was
still
engrossed
with
the
whiskers
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
them
father
i
ca
plant
them
in
the
garden
i
thought
we
might
run
them
up
the
flagstaff
as
we
did
in
barodia
is
that
a
little
unkind
now
that
the
poor
man
dead
merriwig
looked
round
him
to
see
that
there
were
no
eavesdroppers
can
you
keep
a
secret
he
asked
mysteriously
of
course
said
hyacinth
deciding
at
once
that
it
would
not
matter
if
she
only
told
coronel
well
then
listen
he
told
her
of
his
secret
journey
to
the
king
of
barodia
tent
he
told
her
of
the
king
of
barodia
letter
he
told
her
more
fully
of
his
early
duel
with
the
king
he
told
her
everything
that
he
had
said
and
done
and
everything
that
everybody
else
had
said
and
done
to
him
and
his
boyish
pleasure
in
it
all
was
so
evident
and
so
innocent
that
even
a
stranger
would
have
had
nothing
more
reproachful
for
him
than
a
smile
to
hyacinth
he
seemed
the
dearest
of
fathers
and
the
most
wonderful
of
kings
and
by
and
by
the
moment
came
of
which
coronel
had
spoken
and
now
said
merriwig
tell
me
what
you
have
all
been
doing
with
yourselves
here
nothing
much
i
suppose
he
waited
nervously
wondering
if
hyacinth
would
realise
that
all
was
meant
to
include
more
particularly
belvane
hyacinth
drew
a
stool
up
to
her
father
chair
and
sat
down
very
close
to
him
father
she
said
stroking
his
hand
where
it
rested
on
his
knee
i
got
some
news
for
you
nothing
about
the
coun
nothing
serious
i
hope
said
merriwig
in
alarm
it
rather
serious
but
it
rather
nice
father
dear
would
you
mind
much
if
i
got
married
soon
my
dear
you
shall
get
married
as
soon
as
you
like
let
me
see
there
were
six
or
seven
princes
who
came
about
it
only
the
other
day
i
sent
them
off
on
adventures
of
some
kind
but
dear
me
yes
they
ought
to
have
been
back
by
now
i
suppose
you
have
heard
anything
of
them
no
father
said
hyacinth
with
a
little
smile
ah
well
no
doubt
they
were
unsuccessful
no
matter
dear
we
can
easily
find
you
plenty
more
suitors
indeed
the
subject
has
been
very
near
my
thoughts
lately
we
arrange
a
little
competition
and
let
them
know
in
the
neighbouring
countries
there
be
no
lack
of
candidates
let
me
see
there
that
bull
he
getting
a
little
old
now
but
he
was
good
enough
for
the
last
one
we
might
i
do
want
a
suitor
said
hyacinth
softly
i
have
one
merriwig
leant
forward
with
eagerness
my
dear
this
is
indeed
news
tell
me
all
about
it
upon
what
quest
did
you
send
him
hyacinth
had
felt
this
coming
had
she
lived
in
modern
times
she
would
have
expected
the
question
what
is
his
income
a
man
must
prove
his
worth
in
some
way
i
have
sent
him
away
at
all
yet
she
said
he
only
just
come
he
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
sure
you
love
him
well
well
we
arrange
something
for
him
perhaps
that
bull
i
was
speaking
of
by
the
way
who
is
he
he
comes
from
araby
and
his
name
is
udo
of
course
why
did
i
think
of
him
an
excellent
arrangement
my
dear
it
is
udo
i
afraid
father
it
coronel
and
who
might
coronel
be
said
the
king
rather
sternly
he
he
well
he
here
he
is
father
she
ran
up
to
him
impulsively
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
oh
coronel
you
just
in
time
do
tell
father
who
you
are
coronel
bowed
profoundly
to
the
king
before
i
explain
myself
your
majesty
he
said
may
i
congratulate
your
majesty
on
your
wonderful
victory
over
the
barodians
from
the
little
i
have
gathered
outside
it
is
the
most
remarkable
victory
that
has
ever
occurred
but
of
course
i
am
longing
to
hear
the
full
story
from
your
majesty
own
lips
is
it
a
fact
that
your
majesty
made
his
way
at
dead
of
night
to
the
king
of
barodia
own
tent
and
challenged
him
to
mortal
combat
and
slew
him
there
was
an
eagerness
very
winning
in
his
eyes
as
he
asked
it
he
seemed
to
be
envying
the
king
such
an
adventure
an
adventure
after
his
own
heart
merriwig
was
in
an
awkward
position
he
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
to
order
his
daughter
out
of
the
room
leave
us
my
child
he
would
say
these
are
matters
for
men
to
discuss
but
hyacinth
would
know
quite
well
why
she
had
been
sent
out
and
would
certainly
tell
coronel
the
truth
of
the
matter
afterwards
it
really
looked
as
if
coronel
would
have
to
be
let
into
the
secret
too
he
cleared
his
throat
noisily
by
way
of
preparation
there
are
certain
state
reasons
he
said
with
dignity
why
that
story
has
been
allowed
to
get
about
pardon
your
majesty
i
have
no
wish
to
but
as
you
know
so
much
you
may
as
well
know
all
it
happened
like
this
once
more
he
told
the
story
of
his
midnight
visit
and
of
the
king
letter
to
him
but
your
majesty
cried
coronel
it
is
more
wonderful
than
the
other
never
was
such
genius
of
invention
such
brilliance
and
daring
of
execution
so
you
like
it
said
merriwig
trying
to
look
modest
i
love
it
i
knew
he
love
it
put
in
hyacinth
it
just
the
sort
of
story
that
coronel
would
love
tell
him
about
how
you
fought
the
king
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
how
you
pretended
to
be
a
swineherd
and
how
could
any
father
have
resisted
in
a
little
while
hyacinth
and
coronel
were
seated
eagerly
at
his
feet
and
he
was
telling
once
more
the
great
story
of
his
adventures
well
well
said
the
king
at
the
end
of
it
when
he
had
received
their
tribute
of
admiration
those
are
just
a
few
of
the
little
adventures
that
happen
in
war
time
he
turned
to
coronel
and
so
you
i
understand
wish
to
marry
my
daughter
does
that
surprise
your
majesty
well
no
it
does
and
she
i
understand
wishes
to
marry
you
yes
please
father
that
said
coronel
simply
is
much
more
surprising
merriwig
however
was
not
so
sure
of
that
he
liked
the
look
of
coronel
he
liked
his
manner
and
he
saw
at
once
that
he
knew
a
good
story
when
he
heard
one
of
course
he
said
you
have
to
win
her
anything
your
majesty
sets
me
to
do
it
as
well
he
added
with
a
disarming
smile
that
you
can
not
ask
for
the
whiskers
of
the
king
of
barodia
there
is
only
one
man
who
could
have
got
those
truly
an
excellent
young
man
well
we
arrange
something
said
merriwig
looking
pleased
perhaps
your
prince
udo
would
care
to
be
a
competitor
too
hyacinth
and
coronel
interchanged
a
smile
alas
father
she
said
his
royal
highness
is
not
attracted
by
my
poor
charms
wait
till
he
has
seen
them
my
dear
said
merriwig
with
a
chuckle
he
has
seen
them
father
what
you
invited
him
here
tell
me
about
this
hyacinth
he
came
to
stay
with
you
and
he
never
his
royal
highness
put
in
coronel
has
given
his
affections
to
another
aha
so
that
the
secret
now
i
wonder
if
i
can
guess
who
she
is
what
do
you
say
to
the
princess
elvira
of
tregong
i
know
his
father
had
hopes
in
that
direction
hyacinth
looked
round
at
coronel
as
if
appealing
for
his
support
he
took
a
step
towards
her
no
it
not
the
princess
elvira
said
hyacinth
a
little
nervously
the
king
laughed
ah
well
you
must
tell
me
he
said
hyacinth
put
out
her
hand
and
coronel
pressed
it
encouragingly
his
royal
highness
prince
udo
she
said
is
marrying
the
countess
belvane
chapter
xxi
a
serpent
coming
after
udo
belvane
had
now
had
hours
in
which
to
think
it
over
whatever
her
faults
she
had
a
sense
of
humour
she
could
not
help
smiling
to
herself
as
she
thought
of
that
scene
in
the
garden
however
much
she
regretted
her
too
hasty
engagement
she
was
sure
udo
regretted
it
still
more
if
she
gave
him
the
least
opportunity
he
would
draw
back
from
it
then
why
not
give
him
the
opportunity
my
dear
prince
udo
afraid
i
mistook
the
nature
of
my
feelings
said
of
course
with
downcast
head
and
a
maidenly
blush
exit
udo
with
haste
enter
king
merriwig
it
would
be
so
easy
ah
but
then
hyacinth
would
have
won
hyacinth
had
forced
the
engagement
upon
her
even
if
it
only
lasted
for
hours
so
long
as
it
was
a
forced
engagement
hyacinth
would
have
had
the
better
of
her
for
that
time
but
if
she
welcomed
the
engagement
if
she
managed
in
some
way
to
turn
it
to
account
to
make
it
appear
as
if
she
had
wanted
it
all
the
time
then
hyacinth
victory
would
be
no
victory
at
all
but
a
defeat
marry
udo
then
as
if
willingly
yes
but
that
was
too
high
a
price
to
pay
she
was
by
this
time
thoroughly
weary
of
him
and
besides
she
had
every
intention
of
marrying
the
king
of
euralia
to
pretend
to
marry
him
until
she
brought
the
king
in
open
conflict
with
him
and
then
having
led
the
king
to
her
feet
to
dismiss
the
rival
who
had
served
her
turn
that
was
her
only
wise
course
she
did
not
come
to
this
conclusion
without
much
thought
she
composed
an
ode
to
despair
an
elegy
to
an
unhappy
woman
and
a
triolet
to
interfering
dukes
before
her
mind
was
made
up
she
also
considered
very
seriously
what
she
would
look
like
in
a
little
cottage
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
dressed
in
a
melancholy
grey
and
holding
communion
only
with
the
birds
and
trees
a
life
of
retirement
away
from
the
vain
world
a
life
into
which
no
man
came
it
had
its
attractions
but
she
decided
that
grey
did
not
suit
her
she
went
down
to
her
garden
and
sent
for
prince
udo
at
about
the
moment
when
the
king
was
having
the
terrible
news
broken
to
him
udo
was
protesting
over
the
sundial
that
he
loved
belvane
and
belvane
only
and
that
he
was
looking
forward
eagerly
to
the
day
when
she
would
make
him
the
happiest
of
men
so
afraid
was
he
of
what
might
happen
to
him
on
the
way
back
to
araby
the
countess
belvane
cried
merriwig
prince
udo
marry
the
countess
belvane
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
in
my
life
he
glared
at
them
one
after
the
other
as
if
it
were
their
fault
as
indeed
it
was
why
did
you
tell
me
this
before
hyacinth
it
was
only
just
announced
father
who
announced
it
well
er
udo
did
said
coronel
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
ridiculous
in
my
life
i
wo
have
it
but
father
do
you
think
she
make
a
very
good
queen
she
make
a
wonderful
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
what
i
feel
so
strongly
about
is
this
for
month
after
month
i
am
fighting
in
a
strange
country
after
extraordinary
scenes
of
violence
and
peril
i
come
back
to
my
own
home
to
enjoy
the
er
fruits
of
victory
no
sooner
do
i
get
inside
my
door
than
i
have
all
this
thrust
upon
me
all
what
father
said
hyacinth
innocently
all
said
the
king
with
a
circular
movement
of
his
hand
it
too
bad
upon
my
word
it
is
i
wo
have
it
now
mind
hyacinth
i
have
it
but
father
how
can
i
help
it
merriwig
paid
no
attention
to
her
i
come
home
he
went
on
indignantly
fresh
from
the
er
spoils
of
victory
to
what
i
thought
was
my
own
peaceful
er
home
and
what
do
i
find
somebody
here
wants
to
marry
somebody
there
and
somebody
else
over
there
wants
to
marry
somebody
else
over
here
impossible
to
mention
any
person
name
in
even
the
most
casual
way
without
being
told
they
are
going
to
get
married
or
some
nonsense
of
that
sort
i
very
much
upset
about
it
oh
father
said
hyacinth
penitently
wo
you
see
the
countess
yourself
and
talk
to
her
to
think
that
for
weeks
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
my
return
home
and
that
now
i
should
be
met
with
this
it
has
quite
spoilt
my
day
father
cried
hyacinth
coming
towards
him
with
outstretched
hands
let
me
send
for
her
ladyship
began
coronel
perhaps
she
no
no
said
merriwig
waving
them
away
i
am
very
much
displeased
with
you
both
what
i
have
to
do
i
can
do
quite
well
by
myself
he
strode
out
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
hyacinth
and
coronel
looked
at
each
other
blankly
my
dear
said
coronel
you
never
told
me
he
was
as
fond
of
her
as
that
but
i
had
no
idea
coronel
what
can
we
do
now
about
it
oh
i
want
him
to
marry
her
now
he
quite
right
she
make
a
wonderful
queen
oh
my
dear
i
feel
i
want
everybody
to
be
as
happy
as
going
to
be
they
ca
be
that
but
we
do
our
best
for
them
i
can
manage
udo
all
right
i
only
have
to
say
to
him
and
he
do
anything
for
me
hyacinth
i
do
believe
i
ever
kissed
you
in
this
room
yet
have
i
let
begin
now
merriwig
came
upon
the
other
pair
of
lovers
in
belvane
garden
they
were
sharing
a
seat
there
and
udo
was
assuring
the
countess
that
he
was
her
own
little
and
that
they
must
never
be
away
from
each
other
again
the
king
put
his
hand
in
front
of
his
eyes
for
a
moment
as
if
he
could
hardly
bear
it
why
it
his
majesty
said
belvane
jumping
up
she
gave
him
a
deep
curtsey
and
threw
in
a
bewitching
smile
on
the
top
of
it
formality
or
friendliness
he
could
take
his
choice
prince
udo
of
araby
your
majesty
she
looked
shyly
at
him
and
added
perhaps
you
have
heard
i
have
said
the
king
gloomingly
how
do
you
do
he
added
in
a
melancholy
voice
udo
declared
that
he
was
in
excellent
health
at
present
and
would
have
gone
into
particulars
about
it
had
not
the
king
interrupted
well
countess
he
said
this
is
strange
news
to
come
back
to
shall
i
disturb
you
if
i
sit
down
with
you
for
little
oh
your
majesty
you
would
honour
us
udo
dear
have
you
seen
the
heronry
lately
yes
said
udo
it
looks
so
sweet
just
about
this
time
of
the
afternoon
it
does
said
udo
belvane
gave
a
little
shrug
and
turned
to
the
king
i
so
longing
to
hear
all
your
adventures
she
murmured
confidingly
i
got
all
your
messages
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
remember
me
ah
said
merriwig
reproachfully
and
what
do
i
find
when
i
come
back
i
find
he
broke
off
and
indicated
in
pantomime
with
his
eyebrows
that
he
could
explain
better
what
he
had
found
if
udo
were
absent
udo
dear
said
belvane
turning
to
him
have
you
seen
the
kennels
lately
yes
said
udo
they
look
rather
sweet
just
about
this
time
said
merriwig
do
they
said
udo
but
i
am
so
longing
to
hear
said
belvane
how
your
majesty
defeated
the
king
of
barodia
was
it
your
majesty
wonderful
spell
which
overcame
the
enemy
you
remember
that
remember
it
oh
your
majesty
boll
udo
dear
you
like
to
see
the
armoury
no
said
udo
there
are
a
lot
of
new
things
in
it
that
i
brought
back
from
barodia
said
merriwig
hopefully
a
lot
of
new
things
explained
belvane
i
see
them
later
on
said
udo
i
dare
say
they
look
better
in
the
evening
then
you
shall
show
your
majesty
said
belvane
udo
dear
you
can
wait
for
me
here
the
two
of
them
moved
off
down
the
path
together
udo
taken
by
surprise
and
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
tiptoed
across
the
lawn
to
another
garden
seat
belvane
leading
the
way
with
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
merriwig
following
with
an
exaggerated
caution
which
even
henry
smallnose
would
have
thought
overdone
he
is
a
little
slow
is
he
that
young
man
said
the
king
as
they
sat
down
together
i
mean
he
did
seem
to
understand
he
such
a
devoted
lover
your
majesty
he
ca
bear
to
be
out
of
my
sight
for
a
moment
oh
belvane
this
is
a
sad
homecoming
for
month
after
month
i
have
been
fighting
and
toiling
and
planning
and
plotting
and
then
oh
belvane
we
were
all
so
happy
together
before
the
war
belvane
remembered
that
once
she
and
the
princess
and
wiggs
had
been
so
happy
together
and
that
udo
arrival
had
threatened
to
upset
it
all
one
way
and
another
udo
had
been
a
disturbing
element
in
euralia
but
it
would
not
do
to
let
him
go
just
yet
are
we
still
happy
together
she
asked
innocently
there
her
royal
highness
with
her
young
duke
and
i
have
my
dear
udo
and
your
majesty
has
the
the
lord
chancellor
and
all
your
majesty
faithful
subjects
his
majesty
gave
a
deep
sigh
illustration
leading
the
way
with
her
finger
to
her
illustration
following
with
an
exaggerated
i
am
a
very
lonely
man
belvane
when
hyacinth
leaves
me
i
shall
have
nobody
left
belvane
decided
to
risk
it
your
majesty
should
marry
again
she
said
gently
he
looked
unutterable
things
at
her
he
opened
his
mouth
with
the
intention
of
doing
his
best
to
utter
some
of
them
when
not
before
udo
said
belvane
softly
merriwig
got
up
indignantly
and
scowled
at
the
prince
as
the
latter
hurried
over
the
lawn
towards
them
well
really
said
merriwig
i
never
knew
such
a
place
one
simply
ca
ah
your
royal
highness
have
you
seen
our
armoury
i
should
say
he
corrected
himself
as
he
caught
belvane
reproachful
look
have
seen
our
armoury
we
have
her
ladyship
was
much
interested
i
have
no
doubt
your
majesty
he
turned
to
belvane
you
will
be
interested
in
our
armoury
at
home
dear
she
gave
a
quick
glance
at
the
king
to
see
that
he
was
looking
and
then
patted
udo
hand
tenderly
home
she
said
lovingly
how
sweet
it
sounds
the
king
shivered
as
if
in
pain
and
strode
quickly
from
them
your
majesty
sent
for
me
said
coronel
the
king
stopped
his
pacings
and
looked
round
as
coronel
came
into
the
library
ah
yes
yes
he
said
quickly
now
sit
down
there
and
make
yourself
comfortable
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
marriage
which
one
your
majesty
which
one
why
of
course
yours
that
is
to
say
belvane
or
rather
he
came
to
a
stop
in
front
of
coronel
and
looked
at
him
earnestly
well
in
a
way
both
coronel
nodded
you
want
to
marry
my
daughter
merriwig
went
on
now
it
is
customary
as
you
know
that
to
the
person
to
whom
i
give
my
daughter
i
give
also
half
my
kingdom
naturally
before
i
make
this
sacrifice
i
wish
to
be
sure
that
the
man
to
whom
well
of
course
you
understand
that
he
is
worthy
of
the
princess
hyacinth
said
coronel
of
course
he
could
be
he
added
with
a
smile
worthy
of
half
the
kingdom
amended
merriwig
that
he
should
prove
himself
this
is
also
i
think
customary
anything
that
your
majesty
suggests
i
am
sure
of
it
he
drew
up
a
chair
next
to
coronel
and
sitting
down
in
it
placed
his
hand
upon
his
knees
and
explained
the
nature
of
the
trial
which
was
awaiting
the
successful
suitor
in
the
ordinary
way
he
began
i
should
arrange
something
for
you
with
a
dragon
or
in
it
the
knowledge
that
some
such
ordeal
lies
before
him
often
enables
a
suitor
to
discover
before
it
is
too
late
that
what
he
thought
was
true
love
is
not
really
the
genuine
emotion
in
your
case
i
feel
that
an
ordeal
of
this
sort
is
not
necessary
coronel
inclined
his
head
gracefully
i
do
not
doubt
your
valour
and
from
you
therefore
i
ask
a
proof
of
your
cunning
in
these
days
cunning
is
perhaps
the
quality
of
all
others
demanded
of
a
ruler
we
had
an
excellent
example
of
that
he
went
on
carelessly
in
the
war
with
barodia
that
is
just
over
where
the
whole
conflict
was
settled
by
a
little
idea
which
a
very
wonderful
idea
your
majesty
well
well
said
merriwig
looking
very
pleased
it
just
happened
to
come
off
that
all
but
that
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
cunning
may
be
of
even
more
importance
than
valour
in
order
to
win
the
hand
of
my
daughter
and
half
my
kingdom
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
show
a
cunning
almost
more
than
human
he
paused
and
coronel
did
his
best
in
the
interval
to
summon
up
a
look
of
superhuman
guile
into
his
very
frank
and
pleasant
countenance
you
will
prove
yourself
worthy
of
what
you
ask
me
for
said
merriwig
solemnly
by
persuading
prince
udo
to
return
to
araby
alone
coronel
gasped
the
thing
was
so
easy
that
it
seemed
almost
a
shame
to
accept
it
as
the
condition
of
his
marriage
to
persuade
udo
to
do
what
he
was
only
longing
to
do
did
not
call
for
any
superhuman
qualities
of
any
kind
for
a
moment
he
had
an
impulse
to
tell
the
king
so
but
he
suppressed
it
after
all
he
thought
if
the
king
wants
cunning
and
if
i
make
a
great
business
of
doing
something
absurdly
easy
then
he
is
getting
it
merriwig
simple
man
mistook
his
emotions
i
see
he
said
that
you
are
appalled
by
the
difficulty
of
the
ordeal
in
front
of
you
you
may
well
be
so
you
have
known
his
royal
highness
longer
than
i
have
but
even
in
our
short
acquaintance
i
have
discovered
that
he
takes
a
hint
with
extraordinary
slowness
to
bring
it
home
to
him
with
the
right
mixture
of
tact
and
insistence
that
araby
needs
his
immediate
presence
alone
may
well
tax
the
most
serpentine
of
minds
i
can
but
try
it
said
the
serpentine
one
simply
the
king
jumped
up
and
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
you
think
you
can
do
it
he
said
excitedly
if
prince
udo
does
not
start
back
to
araby
alone
said
merriwig
alone
then
i
shall
have
failed
in
my
task
my
dear
said
the
king
to
his
daughter
as
she
kissed
him
that
evening
i
believe
you
are
going
to
marry
a
very
wise
young
man
of
course
i
am
father
i
only
hope
you
be
as
happy
with
him
as
i
shall
be
with
as
i
was
with
your
mother
though
how
he
going
to
bring
it
off
he
added
to
himself
is
more
than
i
can
think
chapter
xxii
the
seventeen
volumes
go
back
again
king
merriwig
of
eastern
euralia
sat
at
breakfast
on
his
castle
walls
he
lifted
the
gold
cover
from
the
gold
dish
in
front
of
him
selected
a
trout
and
conveyed
it
carefully
to
his
gold
plate
when
you
have
an
aunt
but
i
need
not
say
that
again
king
coronel
of
western
euralia
sat
at
breakfast
on
castle
walls
he
lifted
the
gold
cover
from
the
gold
dish
in
front
of
him
selected
a
trout
and
conveyed
it
carefully
to
his
gold
plate
when
your
wife
father
has
an
aunt
prince
udo
of
araby
sat
at
breakfast
but
one
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
refuse
to
follow
udo
through
any
more
meals
indeed
i
think
there
has
been
quite
enough
eating
and
drinking
in
this
book
already
quite
enough
of
everything
in
fact
but
the
time
has
nearly
come
to
say
let
us
speed
the
prince
of
araby
first
his
departure
from
euralia
was
sudden
five
minutes
conversation
with
coronel
convinced
him
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
about
belvane
feelings
for
him
and
that
he
could
leave
for
araby
in
perfect
safety
you
must
come
and
see
us
again
said
merriwig
heartily
as
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
yes
do
said
hyacinth
there
are
two
ways
of
saying
this
sort
of
thing
and
theirs
was
the
second
way
so
was
udo
when
he
answered
that
he
would
be
delighted
it
was
just
a
week
later
that
the
famous
double
wedding
was
celebrated
in
euralia
as
an
occasion
for
by
king
merriwig
and
by
queen
belvane
it
demanded
and
got
a
whole
chapter
to
itself
in
roger
history
i
have
roger
on
my
side
at
last
the
virtues
he
denied
to
the
countess
he
can
not
but
allow
to
the
queen
nor
could
hyacinth
resist
her
any
longer
belvane
upon
her
palfrey
laughter
in
her
eyes
and
roses
in
her
cheeks
her
lips
slightly
parted
with
eagerness
as
she
flings
her
silver
to
the
crowd
adorably
conscious
of
her
childishness
and
yet
glorifying
in
it
could
have
no
enemies
that
day
she
is
a
dear
said
hyacinth
to
coronel
she
will
make
a
wonderful
queen
i
know
a
queen
worth
two
of
her
said
coronel
but
you
do
admire
her
do
you
not
particularly
oh
coronel
you
must
said
hyacinth
but
she
felt
very
happy
all
the
same
they
rode
off
the
next
day
to
their
kingdom
the
chancellor
had
had
an
exciting
week
for
seven
successive
evenings
he
had
been
extremely
mysterious
and
reserved
to
his
wife
but
now
his
business
was
finished
and
king
merriwig
reigned
over
eastern
euralia
and
king
coronel
over
the
west
let
us
just
take
a
look
at
belvane
diary
before
we
move
on
to
the
last
scene
september
it
says
now
for
the
last
scene
king
merriwig
sat
in
belvane
garden
they
had
spent
the
morning
revising
their
joint
book
of
poetry
for
publication
the
first
set
of
verses
was
entirely
merriwig
own
it
went
like
this
boll
bill
woll
will
a
note
by
the
authors
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
could
be
begun
from
either
end
the
rest
of
the
poems
were
mainly
by
belvane
merriwig
share
in
them
consisting
of
a
capital
or
an
i
like
that
when
they
were
read
out
to
him
but
an
epic
commonly
attributed
to
charlotte
patacake
had
crept
in
somehow
a
person
to
see
your
majesty
said
a
flunkey
appearing
suddenly
what
sort
of
person
asked
merriwig
a
sort
of
person
your
majesty
see
him
here
dear
said
belvane
as
she
got
up
i
have
things
to
do
in
the
palace
she
left
him
and
by
and
by
the
flunkey
returned
with
the
stranger
he
was
a
person
with
a
round
face
something
in
the
agricultural
way
to
judge
from
his
clothes
well
said
merriwig
i
desire
to
be
your
majesty
swineherd
said
the
other
what
do
you
know
of
swineherding
i
have
a
sort
of
natural
aptitude
for
it
your
majesty
although
i
have
never
actually
been
one
my
own
case
exactly
now
then
let
me
see
how
would
you
the
stranger
took
out
a
large
red
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
you
propose
to
ask
me
a
few
questions
your
majesty
well
naturally
i
let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
by
all
you
hold
sacred
let
me
implore
you
not
to
confuse
me
with
questions
he
drew
himself
up
and
thumped
his
chest
with
his
fist
i
have
a
feeling
for
swineherding
it
is
enough
merriwig
began
to
like
the
man
it
was
just
how
he
felt
about
the
thing
himself
i
once
carried
on
a
long
technical
conversation
with
a
swineherd
he
said
reminiscently
and
we
found
we
had
much
in
common
it
is
an
inspiring
life
it
was
in
just
that
way
said
the
stranger
that
i
discovered
my
own
natural
bent
towards
it
how
very
odd
do
you
know
there
something
about
your
face
that
i
seem
to
recognise
the
stranger
decided
to
be
frank
i
owe
this
face
to
you
he
said
simply
merriwig
looked
startled
in
short
said
the
other
i
am
the
late
king
of
barodia
merriwig
gripped
his
hand
illustration
was
a
person
with
a
round
my
dear
fellow
he
said
my
very
dear
fellow
of
course
you
are
dear
me
how
it
brings
it
all
back
and
may
i
say
what
an
improvement
really
i
delighted
to
see
you
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
but
first
some
refreshment
at
the
word
refreshment
the
late
king
of
barodia
broke
down
altogether
and
it
was
only
merriwig
hummings
and
hawings
and
thumpings
on
the
back
and
later
on
the
refreshment
itself
which
kept
him
from
bursting
into
tears
my
dear
friend
he
said
as
he
wiped
his
mouth
for
the
last
time
you
have
saved
me
but
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
merriwig
in
bewilderment
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
he
told
himself
of
the
great
resolution
to
which
he
had
come
on
that
famous
morning
when
he
awoke
to
find
himself
whiskerless
barodia
had
no
more
use
for
him
now
as
a
king
and
he
on
his
side
was
eager
to
carve
out
for
himself
a
new
life
as
a
swineherd
i
had
a
natural
gift
he
said
plaintively
an
instinctive
feeling
for
it
i
know
i
had
whatever
they
said
about
it
afterwards
and
they
said
many
hard
things
i
was
certain
that
i
had
that
feeling
i
had
proved
it
you
know
there
could
be
any
mistake
well
ah
but
they
laughed
at
me
they
asked
me
confusing
questions
niggling
little
questions
about
the
things
swine
ate
and
and
things
like
that
the
great
principles
of
swineherding
the
what
i
may
call
the
art
of
herding
swine
the
whole
theory
of
shepherding
pigs
in
a
way
all
this
they
ignored
they
laughed
at
me
and
turned
me
out
with
jeers
and
blows
to
starve
merriwig
patted
him
sympathetically
and
pressed
some
more
food
on
him
i
ranged
over
the
whole
of
barodia
nobody
would
take
me
in
it
is
a
terrible
thing
my
dear
merriwig
to
begin
to
lose
faith
in
yourself
i
had
to
tell
myself
at
last
that
perhaps
there
was
something
about
barodian
swine
which
made
them
different
from
those
of
any
other
country
as
a
last
hope
i
came
to
euralia
if
here
too
i
was
spurned
then
i
should
know
that
just
a
moment
said
merriwig
breaking
in
eagerly
who
was
this
swineherd
that
you
talked
to
i
talked
to
so
many
said
the
other
sadly
they
all
scoffed
at
me
no
but
the
first
one
the
one
that
showed
you
that
you
had
a
bent
towards
it
did
you
say
that
oh
that
one
that
was
at
the
beginning
of
our
war
do
you
remember
telling
me
that
your
swineherd
had
an
invisible
cloak
it
was
he
that
merriwig
looked
at
him
sadly
and
shook
his
head
my
poor
friend
he
said
it
was
me
they
gazed
at
each
other
earnestly
each
of
them
was
going
over
in
his
mind
the
exact
details
of
that
famous
meeting
yes
they
murmured
together
it
was
us
the
king
of
barodia
mind
raced
on
through
all
the
bitter
months
that
had
followed
he
shivered
as
he
thought
of
the
things
he
had
said
the
things
that
had
been
said
to
him
seemed
of
small
account
now
not
even
a
swineherd
he
remarked
come
come
said
merriwig
look
on
the
bright
side
you
can
always
be
a
king
again
the
late
king
of
barodia
shook
his
head
it
a
come
down
to
a
man
with
any
pride
he
said
no
i
stick
to
my
own
job
after
all
i
been
learning
these
last
weeks
at
any
rate
i
know
that
what
i
do
know
is
worth
knowing
and
something
then
stay
with
me
said
merriwig
heartily
my
swineherd
will
teach
you
your
work
and
when
he
retires
you
can
take
it
on
do
you
mean
it
of
course
i
do
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
about
the
place
in
the
evening
when
the
pigs
are
asleep
you
can
come
in
and
have
a
chat
with
us
bless
you
said
the
new
apprentice
bless
you
your
majesty
they
shook
hands
on
it
my
dear
said
merriwig
to
belvane
that
evening
you
have
married
a
very
clever
fellow
i
discovered
this
afternoon
that
i
not
even
as
clever
as
i
thought
i
was
you
do
want
cleverness
in
a
king
said
belvane
smiling
lovingly
at
him
or
in
a
husband
what
do
you
want
then
just
dearness
said
belvane
and
now
my
story
is
done
with
a
sigh
i
unload
the
seventeen
volumes
of
euralian
history
from
my
desk
carrying
them
one
by
one
across
the
library
and
placing
them
carefully
in
the
shelf
which
has
been
built
for
them
for
some
months
they
have
stood
a
rampart
between
me
and
the
world
behind
which
i
have
lived
in
days
with
merriwig
and
hyacinth
and
my
lady
belvane
the
rampart
is
gone
and
in
the
bright
light
of
which
streams
on
to
my
desk
the
vision
slowly
fades
once
on
a
time
yet
i
see
one
figure
clearly
still
he
is
tall
and
thin
with
a
white
peaked
face
of
which
the
long
inquisitive
nose
is
the
outstanding
feature
his
hair
is
lank
and
uncared
for
his
russet
smock
tied
in
at
the
waist
wants
brushing
his
untidy
hose
shows
up
the
meagerness
of
his
legs
no
knightly
figure
this
yet
i
look
upon
him
very
tenderly
for
it
is
roger
scurvilegs
on
his
way
to
the
palace
for
news
to
roger
too
i
must
say
i
say
it
not
without
remorse
for
i
feel
that
i
have
been
hard
upon
the
man
to
whom
i
owe
so
much
perhaps
it
will
not
be
altogether
in
his
seventeen
volumes
there
are
many
other
tales
to
be
found
next
time
if
there
be
a
next
time
i
owe
it
to
roger
to
stand
aside
and
let
him
tell
the
story
more
in
his
own
way
i
think
he
would
like
that
but
it
shall
not
be
a
story
about
belvane
i
saw
belvane
or
some
one
like
her
at
a
country
house
in
shropshire
last
summer
and
i
know
that
roger
can
never
do
her
justice
